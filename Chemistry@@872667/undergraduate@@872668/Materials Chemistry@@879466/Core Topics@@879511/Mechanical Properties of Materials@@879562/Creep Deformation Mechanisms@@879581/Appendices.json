Both forms are linear in $\\sigma$ and are favored at high homologous temperatures, consistent with the stated condition of operation well above half the melting temperature. This matches option B.\n\n- Athermal plastic deformation controlled by dislocation glide is not a creep mechanism governed by thermally activated diffusion; it is typically rate-insensitive and does not exhibit a thermally activated steady-state creep rate of the form observed. Thus option C is not consistent with the observed proportionality and high-temperature creep context.\n\n- Grain boundary sliding requires an accommodation mechanism (diffusion or dislocation processes). When GBS is rate-limited by diffusion, the overall behavior reduces to diffusional creep forms with $n=1$ as above; when controlled by other accommodations (e.g., dislocation activity or elastic accommodation at triple junctions), the stress exponent is generally not $n=1$. The option D description does not represent the canonical linear-stress diffusional creep law.\n\nGiven $n=1$ and the high homologous temperature, the dominant class is diffusional creep.
