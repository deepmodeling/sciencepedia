The pipeline is buried in moist, neutral soil, which acts as an electrolyte. The primary cause of corrosion for the steel (which is mostly iron) is the electrochemical oxidation half-reaction: $Fe \\rightarrow Fe^{2+} + 2e^{-}$. To counteract this, the team decides to use an Impressed Current Cathodic Protection (ICCP) system.

The pipeline can be connected to either terminal, as the current flowing through the soil is sufficient to disrupt the formation of localized galvanic cells on the pipeline's surface.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine the correct way to connect a steel pipeline to a DC power source for cathodic protection and to understand the reasoning behind it.\n\nFirst, let's establish the fundamental electrochemical principles. Corrosion of a metal, like the iron in the steel pipeline, is an oxidation process. Oxidation is the loss of electrons. In an electrochemical cell, the electrode where oxidation occurs is called the anode. The given corrosion reaction is $Fe \\rightarrow Fe^{2+} + 2e^{-}$, which confirms that the iron atoms lose electrons.\n\nThe goal of cathodic protection is to prevent this oxidation. This is achieved by forcing the structure to be protected (the pipeline) to become the cathode of the electrochemical cell. The cathode is the electrode where reduction occurs. Reduction is the gain of electrons. By making the pipeline the cathode, we suppress its natural tendency to act as an anode and corrode.\n\nNow, let's consider the DC power source. A DC power source has a negative terminal and a positive terminal. By convention, electrons flow out of the negative terminal and into the positive terminal. The negative terminal is therefore a source of electrons, maintaining a high electric potential (negative charge), while the positive terminal is a sink for electrons, maintaining a low electric potential (positive charge).\n\nTo force the pipeline to become the cathode (the site of reduction), we need to supply it with an abundance of electrons. This externally supplied surplus of electrons will be consumed by reduction reactions occurring at the pipeline's surface, such as the reduction of dissolved oxygen in the moist soil ($O_2 + 2H_2O + 4e^{-} \\rightarrow 4OH^{-}$). This steady supply of electrons from an external source effectively suppresses the iron atoms' ability to lose their own electrons, thus halting the corrosion (oxidation) process.\n\nTo supply the pipeline with electrons, it must be connected to the terminal of the DC power source that provides electrons. This is the negative terminal.\n\nTherefore, the pipeline must be connected to the negative terminal of the DC power source. This connection floods the pipeline with electrons, forcing it to act as the cathode. The auxiliary anode is connected to the positive terminal of the DC power source, completing the circuit. The auxiliary anode becomes the site of oxidation, sacrificing itself (if not inert) or oxidizing other species in the soil.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this analysis:\nA. Incorrect. Connecting to the positive terminal would draw electrons away from the pipeline, making it the anode and accelerating corrosion. The reasoning about a protective layer of positive ions is also incorrect.\nB. Correct. The pipeline should be connected to the negative terminal, which supplies electrons. This forces the pipeline to be the cathode, the site of reduction, thereby suppressing the oxidation (corrosion) process.\nC. Incorrect. Connecting to the positive terminal is the wrong action. Furthermore, making the pipeline a cathode requires supplying electrons, not drawing them away.\nD. Incorrect. Connecting to the negative terminal is the correct action, but the reasoning is flawed. The anode is the site of oxidation, not reduction.\nE. Incorrect. The direction of the current is crucial. Connecting the pipeline to the positive terminal would turn it into a massive anode and cause catastrophic, rapid corrosion. The specific connection determines whether the pipeline is protected or actively destroyed.\n\nThus, the correct statement is that the pipeline should be connected to the negative terminal to make it the cathode.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1291731"}]}
