You will explore why a simple scratch on a zinc-galvanized steel surface doesn't rust, whereas a similar scratch on tin-plated steel can lead to rapid, localized failure.

The environment is highly corrosive due to the presence of saltwater and oxygen. The primary concern is that any minor scratches or damage to the coating during deployment or service could expose the underlying steel, potentially leading to catastrophic failure of the housing due to rust (the corrosion of iron).\n\nTwo candidate coatings are being considered: zinc (a process known as galvanizing) and tin. To make an informed decision, the engineer analyzes the electrochemical behavior of the systems. Consider the following standard reduction potentials at 25°C:\n\n- $\\text{Fe}^{2+}(aq) + 2e^{-} \\rightarrow \\text{Fe}(s), E^{\\circ} = -0.44$ V\n- $\\text{Zn}^{2+}(aq) + 2e^{-} \\rightarrow \\text{Zn}(s), E^{\\circ} = -0.76$ V\n- $\\text{Sn}^{2+}(aq) + 2e^{-} \\rightarrow \\text{Sn}(s), E^{\\circ} = -0.14$ V\n\nAssuming a scratch exposes the steel (primarily iron) to the corrosive environment, which of the following statements correctly explains the corrosion behavior and provides the best recommendation for protecting the steel housing?\n\nA. A tin coating is superior. In a scratched region, the more noble tin acts as a sacrificial anode, corroding preferentially to protect the steel cathode.\n\nB. A zinc coating is superior. In a scratched region, the more active zinc acts as a sacrificial anode, corroding preferentially to protect the steel cathode.\n\nC. A tin coating is superior. Tin is harder and more resistant to physical scratches than zinc, and it forms a more passive oxide layer that physically blocks the steel from the environment. The electrochemical effects are negligible.\n\nD. A zinc coating is superior. In a scratched region, the less active zinc acts as the cathode, forcing the more active steel to become a sacrificial anode, thereby passivating the steel surface.\n\nE. Both coatings are equally effective. In both cases, the coating acts as a physical barrier. Once scratched, the exposed steel will rust at the same rate regardless of the coating material.", "solution": "Corrosion of a metal is its anodic oxidation.
