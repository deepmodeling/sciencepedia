Interpreting this narrative requires recognizing the characteristic signatures of different physical and chemical events. This practice challenges you to act as a materials detective, using the features of a DTA curve—such as peak direction (endothermic vs. exothermic), shape, and temperature—to identify a sequence of transformations in an amorphous powder [@problem_id:1343351].", "problem": "An amorphous inorganic powder is analyzed using Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA). This technique involves heating the sample and an inert reference material at a constant rate and continuously measuring the temperature difference, $\\Delta T = T_{sample} - T_{reference}$, between them. By convention in the resulting thermogram, an endothermic process in the sample results in a negative (downward) peak, while an exothermic process results in a positive (upward) peak.\n\nThe DTA thermogram of this powder exhibits two main features as the temperature is increased from room temperature:\n1. A broad downward peak beginning at approximately 90°C and ending around 160°C.\n2. A sharp, narrow upward peak centered at 450°C.\n\nBased on the principles of thermal analysis, which of the following sequences of physical or chemical changes provides the most plausible explanation for the observed DTA curve?\n\nA.

Crystallization of the amorphous material, followed by melting of the crystalline phase.\n\nD. Desorption of surface-adsorbed water, followed by crystallization of the amorphous material.\n\nE. A solid-state polymorphic phase transition, followed by sublimation of the sample.", "solution": "We use the DTA definition and sign convention: the measured signal is $\\Delta T = T_{\\text{sample}} - T_{\\text{reference}}$. By the stated convention, endothermic events in the sample produce negative (downward) peaks, and exothermic events produce positive (upward) peaks.\n\nObservation 1: A broad downward peak from about 90°C to 160°C indicates a broad endothermic process over a temperature range, not a sharp first-order transition. In thermal analysis of powders, such broad low-temperature endotherms are characteristic of the removal of physically adsorbed or loosely bound water (desorption/dehydration), which occurs over a range of temperatures and requires heat input, hence endothermic. In contrast, melting typically appears as a relatively sharp endothermic peak at a specific temperature for a crystalline phase; an amorphous material does not show a true first-order melting peak, and a glass transition appears primarily as a baseline shift (step in heat capacity) rather than a pronounced peak. Therefore, the most consistent assignment for the broad low-temperature endotherm is desorption of surface-adsorbed water.\n\nObservation 2: A sharp, narrow upward peak centered at 450°C indicates a well-defined exothermic event. For an amorphous inorganic powder, the most common exothermic process upon heating is crystallization (devitrification), which releases latent heat as the structure orders, producing a sharp exotherm at a characteristic crystallization temperature. Oxidative decomposition is also exothermic but generally pertains to organics or materials containing oxidizable species, not generic inorganic amorphous powders; moreover, the prior broad endotherm at low temperature is more consistent with water removal than with a process that would precede oxidative decomposition. Solid-state polymorphic transitions can be exothermic or endothermic, but their pairing with a subsequent sublimation (endothermic) would not match the observed exothermic second peak.\n\nAssessment of options:\n- A. Melting (endothermic) followed by oxidative decomposition (exothermic): The first feature is too broad and too low in temperature to be a typical melting peak, especially for an amorphous inorganic powder, and amorphous materials do not exhibit a true melting peak; thus inconsistent.\n- B. Glass transition (endothermic step) followed by melting (endothermic peak): The second observed peak is exothermic, contradicting this option.\n- C. Crystallization (exothermic) followed by melting (endothermic): The observed sequence shows the endothermic event first and the exothermic later, so the order and signs do not match.\n- D. Desorption of surface-adsorbed water (endothermic, broad) followed by crystallization of the amorphous material (exothermic, sharp): This matches both the sign and the shape/temperature characteristics.\n- E. Polymorphic transition followed by sublimation: Sublimation is endothermic, but the second observed peak is exothermic; inconsistent.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible sequence is desorption of surface-adsorbed water followed by crystallization of the amorphous material.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1343351"}, {"introduction": "Beyond identifying thermal events, DTA is a powerful quantitative tool for measuring thermodynamic properties.
