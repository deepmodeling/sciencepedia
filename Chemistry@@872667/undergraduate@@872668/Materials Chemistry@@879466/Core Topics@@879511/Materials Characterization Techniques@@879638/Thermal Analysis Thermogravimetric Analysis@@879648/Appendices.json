In Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), the progress of the reaction is tracked by the change in mass.\n\nLet's define the fractional conversion, $\\alpha$, as the fraction of the volatile component that has decomposed at time $t$. This is given by:\n$$\n\\alpha(t) = \\frac{m_0 - m(t)}{m_0 - m_f}\n$$\nwhere $m_0$ is the initial mass, $m_f$ is the final mass, and $m(t)$ is the mass at time $t$. The rate of reaction can be described by the function $g(\\alpha)$, which depends on the reaction model.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Zero-Order Kinetic Model**\nFor a zero-order reaction, the rate is independent of the concentration of the reactant. The differential rate law is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\alpha}{dt} = k\n$$\nIntegrating this equation with the initial condition $\\alpha(0) = 0$ gives the integrated rate law:\n$$\n\\int_0^\\alpha d\\alpha' = \\int_0^t k dt' \\implies \\alpha = kt\n$$\nThis model predicts that the fractional conversion $\\alpha$ is directly proportional to time $t$. Let's substitute the definition of $\\alpha$ in terms of mass:\n$$\n\\frac{m_0 - m(t)}{m_0 - m_f} = kt\n$$\nRearranging for $m(t)$:\n$$\nm_0 - m(t) = k(m_0 - m_f)t\n$$\n$$\nm(t) = m_0 - [k(m_0 - m_f)]t\n$$\nThis equation is in the form of a straight line, $y = b + mx$, where $y = m(t)$, a slope $m = -k(m_0 - m_f)$, and a y-intercept $b = m_0$. Therefore, if the reaction is zero-order, a plot of the sample mass $m(t)$ versus time $t$ should be linear. Analysis 1 in the problem statement corresponds to this test. The reported coefficient of determination is $R^2 = 0.925$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First-Order Kinetic Model**\nFor a first-order reaction, the rate is proportional to the amount of reactant remaining. The fraction of reactant remaining is $(1-\\alpha)$. The differential rate law is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\alpha}{dt} = k(1-\\alpha)\n$$\nTo find the integrated rate law, we separate variables and integrate with the initial condition $\\alpha(0) = 0$:\n$$\n\\int_0^\\alpha \\frac{d\\alpha'}{1-\\alpha'} = \\int_0^t k dt'\n$$\n$$\n[-\\ln(1-\\alpha')]_0^\\alpha = [kt']_0^t\n$$\n$$\n-\\ln(1-\\alpha) - (-\\ln(1)) = kt \\implies -\\ln(1-\\alpha) = kt\n$$\nLet's express $(1-\\alpha)$ in terms of mass:\n$$\n1-\\alpha = 1 - \\frac{m_0 - m(t)}{m_0 - m_f} = \\frac{(m_0 - m_f) - (m_0 - m(t))}{m_0 - m_f} = \\frac{m(t) - m_f}{m_0 - m_f}\n$$\nThis term, $\\frac{m(t) - m_f}{m_0 - m_f}$, represents the fraction of the volatile (reacting) component that has *not yet* decomposed. Substituting this into the integrated rate law for a first-order reaction:\n$$\n-\\ln\\left(\\frac{m(t) - m_f}{m_0 - m_f}\\right) = kt\n$$\nRearranging gives:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{m(t) - m_f}{m_0 - m_f}\\right) = -kt\n$$\nThis equation is in the form of a straight line, $y = mx$, where $y = \\ln\\left(\\frac{m(t) - m_f}{m_0 - m_f}\\right)$, $x=t$, and the slope is $m=-k$. A plot of $\\ln\\left(\\frac{m(t) - m_f}{m_0 - m_f}\\right)$ versus time $t$ should be linear if the reaction follows first-order kinetics. Analysis 2 in the problem statement corresponds to this test. The reported coefficient of determination is $R^2 = 0.998$.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Models and Conclude**\nThe coefficient of determination, $R^2$, measures how well the data fit a linear model. A value of $R^2=1$ indicates a perfect linear fit.\n- The linear fit for the zero-order model (Analysis 1) gives $R^2 = 0.925$.\n- The linear fit for the first-order model (Analysis 2) gives $R^2 = 0.998$.\n\nSince $0.998$ is significantly closer to 1 than $0.925$, we conclude that the first-order kinetic model provides a much better description of the decomposition process.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Multiple-Choice Options**\n- A. The reaction is first-order, but the rate constant is determined from the slope of the logarithmic plot (Analysis 2), not the plot of $m(t)$ vs. $t$. This statement is incorrect.\n- B. The reaction is not zero-order. This statement incorrectly concludes the order and provides faulty reasoning. The non-perfect linearity of the logarithmic plot is expected in real data; what matters is that it is *highly* linear compared to the alternative model.\n- C. This statement correctly identifies the reaction as first-order and provides the correct reason: the high linearity of the plot of $\\ln\\left(\\frac{m(t) - m_f}{m_0 - m_f}\\right)$ versus time, as indicated by the $R^2$ value of 0.998. This is the correct answer.\n- D. This statement incorrectly concludes the reaction is zero-order. While the $R^2$ value of 0.925 might seem high in isolation, it is significantly worse than the fit for the first-order model, making this conclusion incorrect.\n- E. There is sufficient data to make a clear distinction between the two models by comparing the goodness of fit ($R^2$ values). This statement is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate conclusion is that the reaction follows first-order kinetics.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1343599"}]}
