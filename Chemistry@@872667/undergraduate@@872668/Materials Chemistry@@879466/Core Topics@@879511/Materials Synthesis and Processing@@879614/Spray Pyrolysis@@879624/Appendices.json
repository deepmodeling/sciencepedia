As the system cools to room temperature $T_{room}$, both materials attempt to contract. The amount of linear contraction each material would undergo if it were free is proportional to its coefficient of thermal expansion ($\\alpha$) and the change in temperature ($\\Delta T$).\n\nThe change in temperature is:\n$$ \\Delta T = T_{room} - T_{dep} $$\n$$ \\Delta T = 25 \\text{ °C} - 500 \\text{ °C} = -475 \\text{ °C} = -475 \\text{ K} $$\nNote that a change in temperature has the same magnitude in Celsius and Kelvin.\n\nIf they were not bonded, the unconstrained thermal strain for the film ($\\epsilon_f$) and substrate ($\\epsilon_s$) would be:\n$$ \\epsilon_f = \\alpha_f \\Delta T $$\n$$ \\epsilon_s = \\alpha_s \\Delta T $$\n\nHowever, the film is thin and bonded to a very thick substrate.
