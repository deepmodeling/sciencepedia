A critical component of this system is the sprue, a vertical channel that transports the molten metal downwards from a pouring basin. To prevent the aspiration of atmospheric gases and the formation of a low-pressure vortex, which can introduce defects into the final casting, the sprue must be designed to run full of molten metal at all times. This is achieved by ensuring the pressure within the flowing liquid stream remains constant and equal to the local atmospheric pressure.\n\nConsider a simplified model of such a system. The sprue is a vertical channel of height $L$. The pouring basin above it maintains a constant height $h_c$ of molten metal above the sprue's entrance (point 1, at the top). The molten metal exits the sprue at its base (point 2, at the bottom). Let the cross-sectional area of the sprue at the top be $A_1$ and at the bottom be $A_2$.\n\nAssume the molten metal behaves as an ideal, incompressible fluid in steady flow with negligible viscosity. The velocity of the metal at the large free surface in the pouring basin can be considered negligible. Let $g$ be the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nTo satisfy the design requirement of maintaining a constant atmospheric pressure throughout the fluid stream within the sprue, what must be the ratio of the exit area to the entrance area, $A_2 / A_1$? Express your answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $h_c$ and $L$.", "solution": "Let the vertical coordinate be $z$, with $z=0$ at the sprue entrance (point 1), $z=h_{c}$ at the free surface in the pouring basin, and $z=-L$ at the sprue exit (point 2). The fluid is ideal, incompressible, and in steady flow with negligible viscosity. The pressure throughout the flowing stream is maintained at the local atmospheric pressure, equal to that at the free surface. The velocity at the free surface is negligible.\n\nApply Bernoulli’s equation between the free surface (s) and a point $x$ in the sprue:\n$$\n\\frac{p_{s}}{\\rho g}+z_{s}+\\frac{v_{s}^{2}}{2 g}=\\frac{p_{x}}{\\rho g}+z_{x}+\\frac{v_{x}^{2}}{2 g}.\n$$\nWith $p_{s}=p_{x}$ (both atmospheric), $v_{s}=0$, and $z_{s}=h_{c}$, this reduces to\n$$\nh_{c}=z_{x}+\\frac{v_{x}^{2}}{2 g}.\n$$\n\nAt the sprue entrance (point 1, $z_{1}=0$), we obtain\n$$\n\\frac{v_{1}^{2}}{2 g}=h_{c}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad v_{1}=\\sqrt{2 g\\,h_{c}}.\n$$\nAt the sprue exit (point 2, $z_{2}=-L$), we obtain\n$$\n\\frac{v_{2}^{2}}{2 g}=h_{c}+L\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad v_{2}=\\sqrt{2 g\\,(h_{c}+L)}.\n$$\n\nBy continuity for incompressible steady flow through the sprue,\n$$\nA_{1}v_{1}=A_{2}v_{2}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad \\frac{A_{2}}{A_{1}}=\\frac{v_{1}}{v_{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{h_{c}}{h_{c}+L}}.\n$$\n\nThus, to maintain atmospheric pressure throughout the sprue and ensure it runs full, the required area ratio is\n$$\n\\frac{A_{2}}{A_{1}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{h_{c}}{h_{c}+L}}.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{h_{c}}{h_{c}+L}}}$$", "id": "1315041"}, {"introduction": "As molten metal cools and solidifies, it typically contracts, and this volume change must be managed to prevent voids from forming within the part. This problem [@problem_id:1315054] presents a classic casting scenario where a defect has occurred, tasking you to act as a failure analyst. By examining the defect's characteristics and location, you can deduce its origin, linking it directly to the critical role of the riser in feeding the casting during solidification.", "problem": "A materials engineering student is tasked with producing a small, custom gearbox housing via sand casting using an A356 aluminum alloy. During the setup, a miscalculation leads to the use of a cylindrical riser that is significantly smaller in volume than what the design specifications required. The casting is poured successfully and allowed to cool. For post-process analysis, the housing is sectioned through its thickest region, and the cut surface is prepared for metallographic examination. The examination reveals a localized zone of defects concentrated near the geometric center of this thickest section. The defects are characterized as a network of fine, interconnected, filament-like voids with a jagged, dendritic appearance.\n\nBased on this detailed observation, what is the most likely primary cause of this defect?\n\nA. Entrapment of hydrogen gas bubbles that evolved from the molten aluminum during cooling.\n\nB. Solidification shrinkage in a region that became isolated from the supply of liquid feed metal.\n\nC. Premature solidification of two separate metal flow fronts, leading to a lack of fusion within the casting.\n\nD. The formation of a fracture at elevated temperatures due to thermal stresses exceeding the strength of the semi-solid metal.\n\nE. Entrapment of non-metallic particles, such as fragments of the sand mold or oxides from the melt surface.", "solution": "The riser’s function is to supply liquid metal to compensate the volumetric contraction that occurs when an alloy solidifies. For aluminum alloys, the volume of the solid is less than the volume of the liquid at the same mass, so if $V_{l}$ and $V_{s}$ are the volumes in the liquid and solid states, then $\\Delta V = V_{s} - V_{l}  0$, and a feed volume of magnitude $|\\Delta V|$ must be supplied from the riser during solidification to avoid shrinkage voids.\n\nBy Chvorinov’s rule, the solidification time of a region is\n$$\nt_{s} = B \\left( \\frac{V}{A} \\right)^{n},\n$$\nwith $B$ a mold constant and $n$ a positive exponent. The thickest section of the casting has the largest modulus $V/A$ and therefore the longest $t_{s}$; it becomes the last region to solidify (a hot spot). Directional solidification requires that this last-to-freeze region remain connected to a liquid reservoir. However, the setup used a cylindrical riser “significantly smaller in volume than required,” which reduces both the available feed volume and the thermal modulus of the riser, causing the riser to freeze early and sever the liquid connection. The thick central region thus becomes isolated from liquid feed.\n\nIn the mushy zone, feeding of interdendritic liquid is governed by porous flow; a standard form is\n$$\n\\mathbf{q} = - \\frac{k}{\\mu} \\nabla p,\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{q}$ is the volumetric flux, $k$ is the permeability of the dendritic network, $\\mu$ is the viscosity, and $\\nabla p$ is the pressure gradient. As solid fraction increases, $k \\to 0$, so interdendritic feeding becomes ineffective. Without an adequate pressure head and feed path from the riser, the volumetric contraction cannot be compensated, and interdendritic liquid cavitates, producing shrinkage porosity. The resulting morphology is a network of fine, interconnected, filament-like voids with jagged, dendritic outlines, concentrated at the geometric center of the thickest section—the last-to-solidify hot spot.\n\nThis morphology and location discriminate against the other options:\n- Hydrogen gas porosity (A) typically appears as smooth, rounded, often uniformly distributed pores or localized near upper surfaces, not as a dendritic, filamentary network at the center.\n- Cold shuts or lack of fusion (C) present as planar, smooth, surface-connected seams where two fronts meet, not as internal dendritic networks.\n- Hot tearing (D) forms crack-like defects along grain boundaries under restraint, often branching and surface-connected; the surfaces are oxidized, not a spongy interdendritic void network.\n- Non-metallic inclusions (E) are discrete particles or clusters, sometimes with angular morphology, but not an interconnected dendritic void network.\n\nGiven the undersized riser, the central location, and the dendritic, filament-like porosity, the primary cause is solidification shrinkage in a region isolated from liquid feed metal.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1315054"}, {"introduction": "The final properties of a cast component are intimately linked to its microstructure, which is heavily influenced by the parameters of the casting process. A key microstructural feature is dendritic segregation, or coring, which can affect mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. This final practice [@problem_id:1315098] explores how the cooling rate—a direct consequence of the chosen casting method—governs the extent of this segregation, highlighting the crucial relationship between processing, structure, and properties.", "problem": "An engineering team is manufacturing components from a binary copper-nickel alloy. Two different casting methods are used to produce geometrically identical parts. The first method is high-pressure die casting, where molten alloy is injected into a water-cooled steel mold, resulting in a very high cooling rate. The second method is sand casting, where the molten alloy is poured into a sand mold, which is a poor thermal conductor, resulting in a very slow cooling rate. Both processes start with molten alloy of the same initial composition.\n\nDendritic segregation, also known as coring, is a microstructural phenomenon that can occur during the solidification of alloys, leading to compositional variations within individual grains.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately compares the expected level of dendritic segregation in the final, solidified components?\n\nA. The sand-cast part will exhibit a higher degree of dendritic segregation because the slow cooling provides ample time for solute atoms to diffuse and separate into compositionally distinct regions.\n\nB. Both parts will exhibit an identical degree of dendritic segregation because they are cast from the same initial alloy composition.\n\nC. The die-cast part will exhibit a higher degree of dendritic segregation because the rapid solidification provides insufficient time for atomic diffusion to homogenize the solid as it forms.\n\nD. Neither part will exhibit significant dendritic segregation, as this effect is averaged out during the formation of a polycrystalline structure.\n\nE. The die-cast part will exhibit a lower degree of dendritic segregation because the rapid cooling \"freezes\" the initially uniform liquid composition before any segregation can occur.", "solution": "We begin with the definition of microsegregation (dendritic segregation) during solidification of a binary alloy. At the advancing solid-liquid interface, the solute partitions according to the equilibrium partition coefficient\n$$\nk=\\frac{c_{s}^{*}}{c_{l}^{*}},\n$$\nwhere $c_{s}^{*}$ and $c_{l}^{*}$ are the solute concentrations in the solid and liquid at the interface, respectively. For most binary solid solutions, $k \\neq 1$, so newly formed solid has a composition different from that of the adjacent liquid.\n\nTwo limiting solidification models quantify how cooling rate and diffusion influence segregation:\n\n1) Equilibrium solidification with complete diffusion in both liquid and solid (lever-rule limit). In this limit, diffusion in the solid is sufficiently rapid that the solid which has already formed can homogenize continually to the instantaneous equilibrium solid composition at the solidus for the current temperature. Over the course of solidification, this continual back diffusion suppresses compositional gradients within dendrites, and in the extreme limit produces a nearly homogeneous solid of overall composition $c_{0}$ once solidification is complete.\n\n2) Non-equilibrium solidification with no diffusion in the solid but complete mixing in the liquid (Scheil model). In this limit, rapid cooling prevents back diffusion in the solid. The Scheil relations give\n$$c_{l}=c_{0}\\left(1-f_{s}\\right)^{k-1}, \\quad c_{s}=k\\,c_{l}=k\\,c_{0}\\left(1-f_{s}\\right)^{k-1}$$\nwhere $f_{s}$ is the solid fraction and $c_{0}$ is the nominal alloy composition. For $k \\neq 1$, these relations predict strong variation of $c_{s}$ from the dendrite core (early-formed solid) to the interdendritic regions (late-formed solid), i.e., pronounced coring.\n\nWhich limit a given casting approaches depends on the competition between the timescale for solid-state diffusion and the timescale for solidification. A useful measure is the solid-state diffusion length during solidification,\n$$\n\\ell_{s}\\sim\\sqrt{D_{s} t_{s}},\n$$\nwhere $D_{s}$ is the solute diffusivity in the solid at the relevant temperatures and $t_{s}$ is the characteristic time over which a dendrite arm solidifies. If $\\ell_{s}$ is large compared to the dendrite arm spacing $\\lambda_{2}$, substantial homogenization can occur; if $\\ell_{s}\\ll\\lambda_{2}$, the composition gradients produced at the interface are frozen in.\n\n- In high-pressure die casting with very high cooling rates, $t_{s}$ is small, so $\\ell_{s}$ is small relative to $\\lambda_{2}$. This suppresses back diffusion in the solid, pushing the process toward the Scheil limit and producing a higher degree of dendritic segregation.\n\n- In sand casting with very slow cooling, $t_{s}$ is large, so $\\ell_{s}$ can be comparable to or exceed $\\lambda_{2}$. This promotes back diffusion and drives the process toward the equilibrium lever-rule limit, thereby reducing dendritic segregation.\n\nTherefore, the die-cast part will exhibit a higher degree of dendritic segregation. This directly contradicts the idea that rapid cooling preserves a uniform composition; partitioning begins as soon as solidification starts, and rapid cooling primarily prevents its subsequent homogenization. Only in the extreme case of solute trapping at very high interface velocities would $k$ approach an effective value of unity, which is not typical for these casting conditions.\n\nHence, among the given options, the correct statement is that the die-cast part will exhibit a higher degree of dendritic segregation because rapid solidification provides insufficient time for atomic diffusion to homogenize the solid as it forms, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1315098"}]}
