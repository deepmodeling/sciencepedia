Solid-state reactions are governed by the slow diffusion of ions through solid lattices. This final exercise [@problem_id:1335757] invites you to think like an experimentalist, interpreting the results of a hypothetical isotopic labeling experiment to deduce the dominant mobile species during the formation of strontium titanate ($SrTiO_3$). This illustrates a powerful method for uncovering the hidden atomic pathways of solid-state transformations.", "problem": "A materials chemist is investigating the reaction mechanism for the solid-state synthesis of Strontium Titanate ($SrTiO_3$), a perovskite ceramic, from its constituent oxides, Strontium Oxide ($SrO$) and Titanium Dioxide ($TiO_2$). The overall reaction is given by $SrO + TiO_2 \\rightarrow SrTiO_3$.\n\nTo determine the dominant mobile ionic species during the reaction, an isotopic labeling experiment is designed. A dense, polycrystalline pellet of $SrO$ is placed in direct contact with a polished single crystal of $TiO_2$. The initial reactant materials, $SrO$ and $TiO_2$, were synthesized using oxygen of natural isotopic abundance, which consists almost entirely of the $^{16}O$ isotope. The entire assembly is then heated to a temperature of $1350^\\circ C$ for several hours in a furnace with a controlled atmosphere that is highly enriched with the heavy oxygen isotope, $^{18}O_2$.\n\nAfter cooling, a cross-section of the reaction zone is prepared and analyzed using Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS). This technique can measure the concentration of specific isotopes as a function of depth. A distinct, uniform layer of the product, $SrTiO_3$, is observed to have formed at the interface between the original $SrO$ and $TiO_2$ reactants.\n\nWhich one of the following hypothetical descriptions of the $^{18}O$ concentration profile, as measured by SIMS across the $SrO | SrTiO_3 | TiO_2$ layers, would provide definitive evidence that the counter-diffusion of cations ($Sr^{2+}$ and $Ti^{4+}$) is the dominant mass transport mechanism for the growth of the $SrTiO_3$ product layer?\n\nA. The $^{18}O$ concentration is found to be significantly above background levels only at the surfaces of the assembly that were directly exposed to the furnace atmosphere. Within the bulk of the $SrTiO_3$ product layer, the $^{18}O$ concentration is negligible and similar to the background level found in the bulk of the original $SrO$ and $TiO_2$ reactants.\n\nB. The $^{18}O$ concentration is found to be high and relatively uniform throughout the entire thickness of the newly formed $SrTiO_3$ product layer.\n\nC. The $^{18}O$ concentration is found to be high only in a narrow region localized at the original $SrO/SrTiO_3$ interface, and negligible everywhere else.\n\nD.

The $^{18}O$ concentration is at background levels everywhere in the solid sample, indicating no exchange occurred between the gas atmosphere and the solid materials.", "solution": "We begin with the reaction $SrO + TiO_{2} \\rightarrow SrTiO_{3}$. The oxygen stoichiometry is balanced: the reactants provide exactly three oxygen atoms per formula unit of $SrTiO_{3}$, so no net oxygen uptake from the gas is required for product formation. Thus, which ionic species mediates mass transport during growth can be probed by an oxygen isotope tracer without changing the overall stoichiometry.\n\nIn the experiment, the external gas is highly enriched in $^{18}O_{2}$, while the solids initially contain $^{16}O$. Isotope exchange at a free surface establishes a high $^{18}O$ fraction at that surface; subsequent transport of $^{18}O$ into the solid interior requires mobile oxygen defects (oxygen vacancies or interstitials) and is governed by diffusion. Therefore:\n- If oxygen anions are the dominant mobile species responsible for product-layer growth, the tracer $^{18}O$ must be transported from the exposed surfaces into the interior toward the buried $SrO|SrTiO_{3}|TiO_{2}$ region. Detectable $^{18}O$ within the $SrTiO_{3}$ product layer would then be expected. Depending on where the growth front is and which phase provides the oxygen flux, this would appear as either a broadly elevated and relatively uniform $^{18}O$ level throughout the product ($^{18}O$ exchange and diffusion pervasive), or as a localized enrichment near the specific interface where oxygen arrives from the nearest exposed surface (indicating directional oxygen-ion transport through that adjacent phase).\n- If, instead, counter-diffusion of cations ($Sr^{2+}$ and $Ti^{4+}$) through the $SrTiO_{3}$ product layer is the dominant mass transport mechanism, then the oxygen sublattice does not need to move appreciably: the oxygen in $SrTiO_{3}$ is supplied locally from the adjacent $SrO$ and $TiO_{2}$ lattices. In this case, the $^{18}O$ from the gas cannot reach the buried reaction zone unless oxygen diffusion is significant. Thus, under cation-dominated transport with negligible oxygen mobility, the $^{18}O$ signal should be confined to the external surfaces that directly exchange with the gas, and the $SrTiO_{3}$ product layer at the buried interface should remain at background $^{18}O$ levels.\n\nInterpreting the proposed SIMS profiles:\n- Option B (high and uniform $^{18}O$ throughout the $SrTiO_{3}$ layer) implies extensive oxygen exchange and diffusion within the product layer, consistent with oxygen-ion transport, not cation-dominated transport.\n- Options C and D (localized $^{18}O$ enrichment at one buried interface only) require that oxygen tracer has diffused from an exposed surface through one of the solids to the reaction front, again indicating oxygen-ion transport through that specific phase.\n- Option E (background everywhere) would imply no measurable oxygen exchange even at free surfaces, which is not informative about the internal transport mechanism and is physically unlikely under the stated high-temperature, enriched $^{18}O_{2}$ conditions.\n- Option A (significant $^{18}O$ only at exposed surfaces; negligible $^{18}O$ in the bulk, including the $SrTiO_{3}$ product layer) directly indicates that oxygen did not penetrate to the buried reaction zone over the experimental time, while a substantial $SrTiO_{3}$ layer nevertheless formed. Given the oxygen balance of the reaction, this is definitive evidence that growth proceeded by counter-diffusion of cations across the product layer, with the oxygen sublattice essentially stationary on the experimental timescale.\n\nTherefore, the $^{18}O$ profile that provides definitive evidence that cation counter-diffusion dominates is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1335757"}]}
