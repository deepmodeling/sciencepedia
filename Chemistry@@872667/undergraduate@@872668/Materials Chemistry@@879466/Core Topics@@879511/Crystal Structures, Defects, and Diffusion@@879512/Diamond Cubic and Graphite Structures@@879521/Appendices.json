Real-world materials are never perfectly ordered, and their most interesting properties are often governed by structural defects.

The defect is formed by a 90-degree rotation of a C-C bond, which affects a local area of four adjacent hexagonal rings.\n\nLet's analyze the process step-by-step without a diagram.\n\nStep 1: Identify the initial configuration.\nThe initial configuration consists of a perfect hexagonal lattice. We focus on a single C-C bond, let's label its atoms C1 and C2. This bond is shared by two adjacent hexagons. Let's call them Ring A and Ring B. These two rings, in turn, are each adjacent to another hexagon, let's call them Ring C and Ring D, forming a patch of four contiguous hexagons. The total number of vertices in these four rings considered as a group is 24 (4 rings × 6 vertices/ring), although many vertices are shared between rings. The key is that the total number of atoms in this local patch is conserved during the transformation.\n\nStep 2: Describe the bond rotation.\nThe bond C1-C2 rotates by 90 degrees in the plane of the graphene sheet. Imagine the bond is initially oriented vertically. After the rotation, it becomes horizontal. This rotation does not add or remove any atoms.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the change in atomic connectivity.\nBefore the rotation, C1 was bonded to C2 and two other carbon atoms, say C3 and C4, to form its part of the hexagonal lattice. Similarly, C2 was bonded to C1 and two other carbons, say C5 and C6.\nThe 90-degree rotation of the C1-C2 bond forces a rebonding event. The bond between C1 and C2 is preserved, but its orientation changes. To maintain the stable three-coordinate structure of carbon atoms in graphene, the old bonds connecting the C1-C2 pair to their neighbors must break, and new ones must form.\nSpecifically, after rotation, C1 is no longer in a position to bond with C3, and C2 is no longer in a position to bond with C5. Instead, the reoriented C1-C2 pair forms new bonds with their new nearest neighbors. C1 now forms a bond with C5, and C2 forms a bond with C3.\n\nStep 4: Determine the new ring structure.\nLet's trace the new closed loops (rings) formed by this new connectivity.\nThe original two central hexagons (Ring A and Ring B), which shared the C1-C2 bond, are destroyed. In their place, a new structure forms around the reoriented C1-C2 bond.\n- A new ring is formed involving the reoriented C1-C2 bond and atoms C3, C5, and one other atom that was part of the original hexagons. By tracing the path, we find this forms a 5-membered ring (a pentagon).\n- Symmetrically, another 5-membered ring is formed on the other side of the new C1-C2 bond, also involving atoms C4 and C6. So we have created two pentagons.\n- What about the two \"outer\" hexagons (Ring C and Ring D)? They were adjacent to the central pair. The rebonding process also affects them. Each of these outer rings loses a pair of atoms from its original structure but incorporates a new edge from the newly formed pentagonal region. The net effect is that each of these two 6-membered rings gains one atom in its loop, transforming them into 7-membered rings (heptagons).\n\nTherefore, the initial patch of four 6-membered rings is transformed into a cluster containing two 5-membered rings and two 7-membered rings.\n\nStep 5: Verify the result.\nThis configuration is known as a 5-7-7-5 defect. We can perform a sanity check. The total number of vertices in the original configuration was conceptually 4 × 6 = 24. In the new configuration, the total number of vertices is 2 × 5 + 2 × 7 = 10 + 14 = 24. This confirms that the transformation conserves the number of atoms in the affected region, consistent with a bond rearrangement defect.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA. Two 5-membered rings and two 7-membered rings - This matches our derivation.\nB. One 8-membered ring and two 4-membered rings - Total vertices = 8 + 2*4 = 16. Incorrect count.\nC. Four 5-membered rings and one 8-membered ring - Total vertices = 4*5 + 8 = 28. Incorrect count.\nD. Four 7-membered rings - Total vertices = 4*7 = 28. Incorrect count.\nE. One 10-membered ring and two 5-membered rings - Total vertices = 10 + 2*5 = 20. Incorrect count.\n\nThe correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1294041"}]}
