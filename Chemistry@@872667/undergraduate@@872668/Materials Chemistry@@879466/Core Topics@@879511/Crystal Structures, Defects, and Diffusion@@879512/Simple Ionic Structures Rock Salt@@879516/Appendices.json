This structure can be described by a conventional cubic unit cell with a side length given by the lattice parameter, $a$.\n\nIn this arrangement, the positions of the A$^+$ cations can be described by the set of fractional coordinates (0, 0, 0), (1/2, 1/2, 0), (1/2, 0, 1/2), and (0, 1/2, 1/2). The Z$^-$ anions are located at the fractional coordinates (1/2, 1/2, 1/2), (1/2, 0, 0), (0, 1/2, 0), and (0, 0, 1/2). These coordinates are relative to the unit cell axes.
