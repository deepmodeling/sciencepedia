The team performs an indirect cytotoxicity test to determine if the polymer leaches harmful substances into its environment.\n\nFor the experiment, a sample of the polymer is incubated in a standard cell culture medium for 24 hours to create a \"polymer extract\". This extract is then added to a culture of human fibroblast cells. A parallel \"control\" culture of the same cells is maintained in a fresh medium that has not been exposed to the polymer.\n\nAfter 48 hours of incubation, a colorimetric viability assay is conducted on both cell populations. In this assay, a reagent is added that is chemically reduced by the mitochondrial enzymes of living cells to form a colored formazan product. The concentration of this colored product, which is directly proportional to the number of viable cells, is measured by reading the absorbance of the solution using a spectrophotometer.\n\nThe raw experimental data are as follows:\n- The average absorbance for the cell culture treated with the polymer extract is $A_{\\text{extract}} = 0.613$.\n- The average absorbance for the control cell culture (in fresh medium) is $A_{\\text{control}} = 1.458$.\n- A \"blank\" reading is taken from a well containing only the cell culture medium and the assay reagent, but no cells.

You will learn to synthesize information on material composition, mechanical properties like Young's modulus, and biological responses to make a well-justified selection, highlighting the critical importance of balancing biocompatibility with biomechanical principles like stress shielding.", "problem": "A biomedical materials engineer is tasked with selecting the most suitable material for the femoral stem of a total hip replacement for a patient who has a severe, documented allergy to nickel. The engineer is considering three common alloys: 316L stainless steel, a cobalt-chromium-molybdenum (Co-Cr-Mo) alloy, and a titanium-aluminum-vanadium (Ti-6Al-4V) alloy. The following table summarizes key properties of these materials, along with those of human cortical bone.\n\n| Material               | Principal Composition (wt.%)                          | Young's modulus (GPa) | Density (g/cm³) |\n| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------- |\n| 316L Stainless Steel   | Fe (balance), 16-18 Cr, 10-14 Ni, 2-3 Mo              | 200                   | 8.0             |\n| Co-Cr-Mo Alloy         | Co (balance), 27-30 Cr, 5-7 Mo, &lt;0.35 Ni         | 220                   | 8.3             |\n| Ti-6Al-4V Alloy        | Ti (balance), 5.5-6.5 Al, 3.5-4.5 V, Ni-free          | 115                   | 4.4             |\n| Cortical Bone          | -                                                     | 15-20                 | 1.8-2.0         |\n\nAll three metallic alloys are known to form a stable, passive oxide layer that gives them good to excellent corrosion resistance in the physiological environment.\n\nBased on the provided data and fundamental principles of biomaterials science, which of the following statements presents the most complete and accurate justification for choosing the Ti-6Al-4V alloy for this specific patient?\n\nA. The Ti-6Al-4V alloy is the best choice because it has the highest strength-to-weight ratio, which is the most critical factor for a load-bearing implant.\n\nB. The Ti-6Al-4V alloy should be selected because it is completely free of nickel, preventing an allergic reaction. Its Young's modulus is also significantly closer to that of cortical bone, which helps to reduce the risk of stress shielding and subsequent bone density loss around the implant.\n\nC. The Co-Cr-Mo alloy is a better choice than Ti-6Al-4V because it has a higher Young's modulus, making it stiffer and more durable under the cyclic loading experienced in the hip joint. The trace amount of nickel is insignificant for an allergic patient.\n\nD. The 316L stainless steel is the most cost-effective option and its good corrosion resistance is sufficient for most patients, so it should be the default choice unless a specific issue arises post-implantation.\n\nE. Both Co-Cr-Mo and Ti-6Al-4V are acceptable choices as their excellent corrosion resistance, provided by their passive oxide layers, will prevent any metal ions, including nickel, from leaching into the body.", "solution": "The clinical constraint is a severe nickel allergy. Therefore, any alloy containing nickel poses a risk of hypersensitivity due to possible metal ion release in vivo. From the table: 316L stainless steel contains 10–14 wt.% Ni, and the Co-Cr-Mo alloy contains a trace amount, less than 0.35 wt.% Ni. In contrast, Ti-6Al-4V is nickel-free by composition. Although all three alloys are passivated, passive films can undergo tribocorrosion, fretting, crevice corrosion, or localized breakdown, which can release ions; thus passivity does not guarantee zero nickel release. Consequently, only a nickel-free alloy eliminates the source term for nickel ions.\n\nBeyond allergy, minimizing stress shielding is a key biomechanical design principle. For an implant and surrounding cortical bone that are mechanically in parallel, they experience approximately the same strain, so by Hooke’s law, the stress in each material satisfies $\\sigma = E\\epsilon$. The load fraction carried by the implant with cross-sectional area $A_{i}$ and modulus $E_{i}$, and by bone with $A_{b}$ and $E_{b}$, is given by\n$$\nf_{i}=\\frac{F_{i}}{F}=\\frac{E_{i}A_{i}}{E_{i}A_{i}+E_{b}A_{b}}.\n$$\nFor fixed geometry, a larger $E_{i}$ shifts load to the implant and away from bone, reducing the mechanical stimulus in bone and increasing the risk of stress shielding and bone resorption (Wolff’s law). Among the candidates, $E$ for Ti-6Al-4V is about 115 GPa, which is significantly closer to cortical bone (15–20 GPa) than 316L stainless steel (about 200 GPa) or Co-Cr-Mo (about 220 GPa). Therefore, Ti-6Al-4V reduces, though does not eliminate, modulus mismatch and the associated stress shielding.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incomplete and misprioritized: while Ti-6Al-4V has a favorable strength-to-weight ratio, the critical issues here are nickel avoidance and modulus matching to mitigate stress shielding.\n- B correctly states that Ti-6Al-4V is nickel-free, directly addressing the allergy, and that its modulus is closer to bone, reducing stress shielding and periprosthetic bone loss.\n- C is incorrect: a higher implant modulus increases stress shielding. Moreover, asserting that trace nickel is insignificant contradicts the constraint of a severe, documented nickel allergy.\n- D is inappropriate: cost cannot override a known severe hypersensitivity and biomechanical considerations; 316L contains substantial nickel.\n- E is incorrect: although passive oxides reduce corrosion, they do not ensure zero ion release, especially under fretting and wear; furthermore, Co-Cr-Mo still contains nickel.\n\nThus, the most complete and accurate justification is that Ti-6Al-4V is nickel-free and has a modulus closer to bone, thereby reducing both allergic risk and stress shielding.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1315655"}, {"introduction": "Modern biomaterials are often designed not just to be inert, but to actively promote a desired biological response.
