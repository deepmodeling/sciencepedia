The magnetization, $M$, of the sample is measured as an external magnetic field, $H$, is slowly increased from zero. The following behavior is observed:\n\n1.  For applied fields from $H = 0$ up to a value $H_{c1}$, the magnetization is found to be strictly linear with the applied field, following the relation $M = -H$.\n2.  When the applied field is increased beyond $H_{c1}$, the magnitude of the negative magnetization begins to decrease, moving from its value at $H_{c1}$ progressively towards zero.\n3.  At a second, higher field value $H_{c2}$, the magnetization becomes effectively zero and remains so for all $H  H_{c2}$.\n\nBased on these experimental observations, how should this material be classified?\n\nA. Type I superconductor\n\nB. Type II superconductor\n\nC. A perfect diamagnet at all field strengths\n\nD. A soft paramagnet\n\nE. A hard ferromagnet", "solution": "We interpret the magnetization data using the constitutive relation in SI units, $B=\\mu_{0}(H+M)$. In a superconductor exhibiting the Meissner effect, magnetic induction is expelled from the bulk so that $B=0$ for sufficiently small applied fields, which implies $H+M=0$ and hence $M=-H$. This is a perfect diamagnetic response with susceptibility $\\chi=-1$.\n\nObservation 1 states that for $0 \\leq H \\leq H_{c1}$, the material shows $M=-H$, i.e., full Meissner expulsion, consistent with superconductivity. Observation 2 states that for $HH_{c1}$ the magnitude of the negative magnetization decreases continuously toward zero as $H$ increases. This behavior indicates partial flux penetration: the induction $B$ becomes nonzero while superconductivity persists in parts of the sample. This is the mixed (Shubnikov) state characteristic of Type II superconductors, which occurs between a lower critical field $H_{c1}$ and an upper critical field $H_{c2}$. Observation 3 states that at $H_{c2}$ the magnetization becomes effectively zero for all $HH_{c2}$, indicating that superconductivity is destroyed and the material is in its normal state with negligible magnetization (for a nonmagnetic metal), consistent with the definition of $H_{c2}$ for Type II superconductors.\n\nBy contrast, a Type I superconductor has a single critical field $H_{c}$; for $HH_{c}$ it exhibits $M=-H$ (Meissner state), and at $H=H_{c}$ it transitions abruptly to the normal state with $M\\approx 0$, without an extended field range of gradual reduction in $|M|$. Therefore Observation 2 rules out Type I behavior. The remaining options are also inconsistent: a perfect diamagnet at all fields would retain $M=-H$ for all $H$, which is contradicted by the vanishing $M$ for $HH_{c2}$; a soft paramagnet would have small positive $M$ proportional to $H$ rather than negative $M$; and a hard ferromagnet would display hysteresis and remanent magnetization, not the reversible superconducting features described.\n\nThus, the presence of two critical fields $H_{c1}$ and $H_{c2}$ with a mixed state in between uniquely identifies a Type II superconductor.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1338548"}, {"introduction": "A superconductor is often described as having zero electrical resistance, but this property alone does not capture its most unique characteristic.
