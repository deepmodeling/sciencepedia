The behavior of this alloy is characterized by four critical transformation temperatures: the Martensite start ($M_s$) and finish ($M_f$) temperatures, and the Austenite start ($A_s$) and finish ($A_f$) temperatures. For this specific alloy, the temperatures are ordered as $M_f < M_s < A_s < A_f$.\n\nThe engineer subjects the SMA wire to the following thermo-mechanical cycle:\n1.  The wire begins in its straight, stress-free \"parent\" shape at a stable high temperature $T_1 > A_f$. This is designated as Point P1.\n2.  The wire is cooled to a low temperature $T_2 < M_f$. While held at this temperature, it is mechanically bent, inducing a macroscopic deformation strain of $\\epsilon_L$. The state of the wire at the end of this step is designated as Point P2.\n3.  The wire, now free of any external forces, is heated to the temperature $T_1 > A_f$. The state of the wire is now designated as Point P3.\n4.  Finally, the wire is once again cooled without any external forces to the temperature $T_2 < M_f$. This final state is designated as Point P4.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly describes the combination of the material's phase (Austenite or Martensite) and its macroscopic strain at points P1, P2, P3, and P4?\n\nA.

On subsequent cooling without external load, the material transforms to twinned Martensite without re-developing the prior macroscopic deformation (no two-way effect).\n- Strain decomposition: The macroscopic strain can be written as\n$$\n\\epsilon=\\epsilon^{el}+\\epsilon^{tr},\n$$\nwhere $\\epsilon^{el}$ is the elastic strain and $\\epsilon^{tr}$ is the transformation (detwinning) strain. Under zero external force, $\\epsilon^{el}=0$. Twinned Martensite under zero stress has $\\epsilon^{tr}=0$; detwinned Martensite under load has $\\epsilon^{tr}=\\epsilon_{L}$; Austenite has $\\epsilon^{tr}=0$.\n\nStep-by-step states:\n1) P1: $T_{1}>A_{f}$ and stress-free. Hence the phase is fully Austenite. With no external force, $\\epsilon^{el}=0$ and Austenite carries no transformation strain, so $\\epsilon=0$. Therefore, P1: (Austenite, Strain $=0$).\n\n2) Cool to $T_{2}<M_{f}$, then bend at $T_{2}$ to induce macroscopic deformation $\\epsilon_{L}$. At $T_{2}<M_{f}$, the phase is Martensite. The applied bending detwins Martensite and produces $\\epsilon^{tr}=\\epsilon_{L}$; after unloading at this temperature, the detwinned Martensite retains the transformation strain, so $\\epsilon=\\epsilon_{L}$. Therefore, P2: (Martensite, Strain $=\\epsilon_{L}$).\n\n3) Heat without external forces to $T_{1}>A_{f}$. On heating through $A_{s}$ to $A_{f}$, the detwinned Martensite transforms to Austenite, recovering the parent shape due to the one-way shape memory effect. Under zero load, $\\epsilon^{el}=0$ and Austenite has $\\epsilon^{tr}=0$, so the macroscopic strain returns to $\\epsilon=0$. Therefore, P3: (Austenite, Strain $=0$).\n\n4) Cool again without external forces to $T_{2}<M_{f}$. On cooling without load, Austenite transforms to twinned Martensite. In one-way SMA, there is no spontaneous macroscopic shape change on cooling in the absence of load; the resulting twinned Martensite has $\\epsilon^{tr}=0$, and with no external load $\\epsilon^{el}=0$, so $\\epsilon=0$. Therefore, P4: (Martensite, Strain $=0$).\n\nCollecting these, the correct option is:\nP1: (Austenite, $0$); P2: (Martensite, $\\epsilon_{L}$); P3: (Austenite, $0$); P4: (Martensite, $0$), which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1331942"}, {"introduction": "The transformation between martensite and austenite is not an instantaneous event but occurs progressively over a specific temperature range. This practice delves into the state of an SMA when it is held at a temperature within the transformation window, resulting in a stable mixture of both phases. By applying a simple linear model [@problem_id:1331961], you can quantify the volume fractions of austenite and martensite, which is crucial for designing actuators that require precise partial transformations.", "problem": "A Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) is an advanced material that can \"remember\" a specific shape and return to it when heated. This behavior is governed by a phase transformation between two solid-state phases: a low-temperature phase called Martensite and a high-temperature phase called Austenite. The transformation exhibits thermal hysteresis, characterized by four critical temperatures:\n- $M_s$: The temperature at which the transformation from Austenite to Martensite starts upon cooling.\n- $M_f$: The temperature at which the transformation to Martensite is finished upon cooling.\n- $A_s$: The temperature at which the transformation from Martensite to Austenite starts upon heating.\n- $A_f$: The temperature at which the transformation to Austenite is finished upon heating.\n\nConsider a particular Nitinol SMA component designed for a thermal actuator. Its transformation temperatures under zero-stress conditions are given as: $M_s = 25\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$, $M_f = 10\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$, $A_s = 35\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$, and $A_f = 55\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$.\n\nTo initialize the actuator, the component is first fully annealed at a high temperature (well above $A_f$) and then cooled in a stress-free state to a temperature of 5 °C. Following this initialization, the component is slowly heated. The process is paused, and the component is held isothermally at an operating temperature, $T_{op}$, which is exactly halfway between $A_s$ and $A_f$.\n\nAssuming the volume fraction of the Austenite phase increases linearly with temperature throughout the transformation range from $A_s$ to $A_f$, which of the following statements best describes the state of the SMA material at the operating temperature $T_{op}$?\n\nA. The alloy consists of 100% Austenite.\n\nB. The transformation to Austenite has not yet begun, and the alloy is 100% Martensite.\n\nC. The alloy consists of a stable mixture of approximately 50% Austenite and 50% Martensite.\n\nD. The alloy consists of a stable mixture of approximately 75% Austenite and 25% Martensite.\n\nE. The alloy is in a metastable state, causing it to rapidly revert to 100% Martensite.\n\nF. All the Martensite has transformed into an intermediate R-phase, which precedes the formation of Austenite.", "solution": "The SMA exhibits thermally induced, first-order phase transformations with hysteresis, so the relevant transformation temperatures on heating are $A_s$ (start) and $A_f$ (finish). After annealing above $A_f$ and cooling to a temperature below $M_f$, the material is fully Martensitic at the start of the subsequent heating. Upon reheating in a stress-free state, the transformation from Martensite to Austenite begins at $T = A_s$ and completes at $T = A_f$.\n\nBy the problem’s assumption, the Austenite volume fraction $f_{A}(T)$ varies linearly with temperature across the interval $[A_s, A_f]$. The standard linear model consistent with this assumption is\n$$\nf_{A}(T) =\n\\begin{cases}\n0, & T \\leq A_s, \\\\\n\\dfrac{T - A_s}{A_f - A_s}, & A_s < T < A_f, \\\\\n1, & T \\geq A_f.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe operating temperature is specified to be exactly halfway between $A_s$ and $A_f$:\n$$\nT_{op} = \\frac{A_s + A_f}{2}.\n$$\nEvaluating the linear fraction at $T_{op}$ gives\n$$\nf_{A}(T_{op}) = \\frac{T_{op} - A_s}{A_f - A_s}\n= \\frac{\\frac{A_s + A_f}{2} - A_s}{A_f - A_s}\n= \\frac{A_f - A_s}{2\\left(A_f - A_s\\right)}\n= \\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\nThus, at $T_{op}$ the alloy is a two-phase mixture consisting of one half Austenite and one half Martensite. Because $T_{op}$ lies strictly between $A_s$ and $A_f$ on the heating path, the transformation has begun but not completed, and the isothermal hold results in a stable mixture determined by the temperature. This corresponds to the description of a stable mixture of approximately one half Austenite and one half Martensite.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is the statement indicating a stable mixture of approximately $0.5$ Austenite and $0.5$ Martensite.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1331961"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the temperature-induced shape memory effect, many SMAs exhibit superelasticity, a phenomenon where they can recover from large strains.
