One common top-down method is liquid-phase exfoliation, where a bulk layered material is sonicated in a suitable solvent. The efficiency of this process critically depends on the energetic favorability of separating the material's layers within the solvent. A successful exfoliation is typically achieved when the cohesive energy of the solvent closely matches the interlayer binding energy of the solid.\n\nThe Hansen Solubility Parameters (HSPs) provide a powerful framework for predicting solvent-material compatibility. Each material (solute or solvent) is characterized by a set of three parameters: $\\delta_D$ for nonpolar dispersion interactions, $\\delta_P$ for polar dipole-dipole interactions, and $\\delta_H$ for hydrogen bonding interactions. The similarity between a solvent (subscript 1) and a solute (subscript 2) can be quantified by calculating the Hansen solubility distance, $R_a$, using the following equation:\n\n$$R_a = \\sqrt{4(\\delta_{D,1} - \\delta_{D,2})^2 + (\\delta_{P,1} - \\delta_{P,2})^2 + (\\delta_{H,1} - \\delta_{H,2})^2}$$\n\nA smaller value of $R_a$ indicates a better match and therefore a more effective solvent for exfoliation.\n\nA research group is attempting to exfoliate bulk hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) to produce h-BN nanosheets.
