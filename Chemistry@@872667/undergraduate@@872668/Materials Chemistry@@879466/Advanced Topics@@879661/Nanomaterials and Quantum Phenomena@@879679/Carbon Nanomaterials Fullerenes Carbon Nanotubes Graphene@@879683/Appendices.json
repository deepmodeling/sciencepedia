Spectroscopic analysis confirms that the molecule's structure is a convex polyhedron. In this structure, each of the 90 carbon atoms is located at a vertex. The cage-like framework is composed exclusively of pentagonal and hexagonal faces. Furthermore, it is known that each carbon atom is covalently bonded to three other carbon atoms, meaning each vertex is of degree 3. Based on this information, determine the total number of hexagonal faces present in a single C90 fullerene molecule.", "solution": "Let $V$ be the number of vertices, $E$ the number of edges, $F$ the number of faces, and let $p$ and $h$ denote the numbers of pentagonal and hexagonal faces, respectively.
