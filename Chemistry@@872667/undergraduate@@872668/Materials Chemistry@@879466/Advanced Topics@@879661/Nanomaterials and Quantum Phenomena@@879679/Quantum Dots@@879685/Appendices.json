This exercise moves from the quantum core to the ligand shell, exploring how surface molecules dictate whether quantum dots can form a stable dispersion or will simply clump together and precipitate. Understanding these principles of intermolecular forces is crucial for designing, purifying, and deploying quantum dots in diverse environments, from nonpolar solvents to the aqueous systems required for bio-imaging. [@problem_id:1328845]", "problem": "A materials chemist is working with Cadmium Selenide (CdSe) quantum dots. These nanocrystals are synthesized to have a nearly spherical inorganic core. To prevent aggregation and allow for dispersion in a nonpolar organic solvent, the surface of each quantum dot is passivated with a dense layer of oleic acid molecules. Oleic acid can be described as a molecule with a polar carboxylic acid head group and a long, nonpolar hydrocarbon tail containing 18 carbon atoms. The carboxylic acid head group anchors the molecule to the surface of the CdSe core, leaving the nonpolar tails extending outwards.\n\nInitially, the oleic acid-capped CdSe quantum dots are successfully dispersed in hexane ($C_{6}H_{14}$), a nonpolar solvent, forming a stable, clear, and brightly colored colloidal dispersion. The chemist then attempts a solvent exchange procedure. The hexane dispersion is added to a large volume of methanol ($CH_{3}OH$), a highly polar solvent. The mixture is agitated, and the lower-boiling-point hexane is subsequently removed completely via rotary evaporation, leaving the quantum dots in pure methanol.\n\nBased on the principles of intermolecular forces and colloidal chemistry, predict the most likely final state of the quantum dots in the methanol.\n\nA.

The effective pair potential can be written schematically as\n$$\nU_{\\text{tot}}(r)=U_{\\text{vdW}}(r)+U_{\\text{steric}}(r)+U_{\\text{elec}}(r),\n$$\nwhere $U_{\\text{vdW}}$ is the van der Waals attraction between inorganic cores across the medium, $U_{\\text{steric}}$ arises from the overlap of the grafted ligand shells, and $U_{\\text{elec}}$ accounts for any electrostatic double-layer contributions. For oleic-acid-capped quantum dots in nonpolar solvents, electrostatic interactions are typically negligible, so stability relies on steric repulsion provided by well-solvated hydrocarbon ligand shells.\n\nIn hexane, a nonpolar solvent, the oleic acid hydrocarbon tails are in a good solvent environment. Using polymer-brush and solution thermodynamics language, the solvent quality can be characterized by a Flory-Huggins parameter $\\chi$, with good solvent behavior corresponding to $\\chi<\\frac{1}{2}$. In that regime, the ligand shells are swollen, maximizing $U_{\\text{steric}}(r)>0$ upon approach due to unfavorable loss of configurational entropy and solvent exclusion, which produces a repulsive barrier that prevents aggregation. Equivalently, the free energy change for dispersion is favorable,\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{disp}}=\\Delta H_{\\text{solv}}-T\\Delta S_{\\text{mix}}<0,\n$$\nbecause the enthalpy of solvating hydrocarbon chains by a nonpolar solvent is favorable and the entropic term is not prohibitive, yielding a stable, clear colloid.\n\nUpon transfer to methanol, a polar protic solvent, the hydrocarbon ligand tails are in a poor solvent environment, corresponding to $\\chi>\\frac{1}{2}$. A standard relation is $\\chi\\propto\\left(\\delta_{\\text{lig}}-\\delta_{\\text{solv}}\\right)^{2}$, where $\\delta_{\\text{lig}}$ and $\\delta_{\\text{solv}}$ are solubility parameters; a large mismatch between hydrocarbon ligands and methanol makes $\\chi$ large, rendering the ligand shell collapsed rather than swollen. This collapse dramatically reduces $U_{\\text{steric}}(r)$, eliminating the repulsive barrier. Simultaneously, methanol can hydrogen-bond to the carboxylic acid headgroups and alter headgroup solvation, potentially weakening ligand binding and further diminishing steric stabilization. With $U_{\\text{steric}}(r)$ small, the net $U_{\\text{tot}}(r)$ is dominated by attractive $U_{\\text{vdW}}(r)$, so there is no kinetic barrier to aggregation. The corresponding dispersion free energy becomes unfavorable,\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{disp}}=\\Delta H_{\\text{solv}}-T\\Delta S_{\\text{mix}}>0,\n$$\nbecause solvating hydrocarbon chains in methanol is enthalpically unfavorable and offers no compensating entropic gain. The standard colloidal purification practice of adding a polar nonsolvent such as methanol to a nonpolar dispersion exploits exactly this antisolvent effect to precipitate the quantum dots.\n\nThe alternative options are inconsistent with these principles: a true molecular solution is impossible for nanocrystals (they disperse as particles, not molecules), a stable emulsion requires two immiscible liquid phases (not present in the final, pure methanol), and a required large, permanent color change would imply a chemical transformation of the inorganic core or ligand shell, which is not driven by simple exposure to methanol under the stated conditions.
