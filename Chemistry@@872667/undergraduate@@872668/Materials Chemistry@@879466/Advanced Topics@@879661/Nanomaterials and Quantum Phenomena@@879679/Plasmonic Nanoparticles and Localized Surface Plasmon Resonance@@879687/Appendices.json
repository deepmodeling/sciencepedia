For subwavelength spherical particles, the quasi-static (electrostatic) approximation applies, and the dipolar LSPR occurs when the real part of the metal dielectric function satisfies the resonance condition\n$$\n\\Re\\{\\epsilon_{\\text{metal}}(\\omega_{\\text{res}})\\}=-2\\,\\epsilon_{m},\n$$\nwhere $\\epsilon_{m}$ is the dielectric constant of the surrounding medium (here, pure water), and $\\omega_{\\text{res}}$ is the angular frequency corresponding to the LSPR.

For the same $\\epsilon_{m}$, different metals have different $\\epsilon_{\\text{metal}}(\\omega)$, so their LSPR wavelengths differ. In water, spherical gold nanoparticles exhibit an LSPR near $\\lambda\\approx 520$ nm, whereas spherical silver nanoparticles exhibit an LSPR at substantially shorter wavelengths (in the blue, well below 500 nm), because for silver the resonance condition $\\Re\\{\\epsilon_{\\text{Ag}}(\\omega)\\}=-2\\,\\epsilon_{m}$ is satisfied at higher photon energies than for gold. Thus, an LSPR maximum at $520$ nm in water is consistent with gold, not silver.\n\nThe peak shape and multiplicity further constrain shape and size dispersion. Anisotropic shapes such as nanorods support multiple plasmon modes: a transverse mode near the spherical resonance and a longitudinal mode at longer wavelengths set by the aspect ratio. Therefore, gold nanorods typically show two distinct LSPR peaks rather than a single one. The observation of a single, well-defined and sharp peak strongly indicates spherical particles and a narrow size distribution. A broad size distribution of spheres would yield a broadened, less sharp peak due to the integral over $R$ above. Finally, CdSe quantum dots are semiconductor nanocrystals that exhibit excitonic absorption features rather than metallic LSPR; their spectra are not described by the above plasmonic resonance condition and therefore are inconsistent with the observed single sharp LSPR at $520$ nm.\n\nTherefore, the most likely conclusion is that the solution contains spherical gold nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1323903"}, {"introduction": "Beyond their intrinsic properties, the optical signature of plasmonic nanoparticles is exquisitely sensitive to their local environment.
