The mobility of an ion is heavily influenced by its size. A materials chemist is investigating a theoretical electrolyte structure where ions and atoms must fit into specific sites within a host material. The species under consideration are the chloride ion ($Cl^{-}$), the neutral argon atom ($Ar$), and the potassium ion ($K^{+}$). These three species form an isoelectronic series, meaning they all have the same number of electrons.\n\nBased on the fundamental principles of atomic structure and effective nuclear charge, which of the following options correctly arranges these three species in order of increasing radius (from smallest to largest)?\n\nA. $K^{+} < Ar < Cl^{-}$\n\nB. $Cl^{-} < Ar < K^{+}$\n\nC. $Ar < Cl^{-} < K^{+}$\n\nD. $K^{+} < Cl^{-} < Ar$\n\nE. All three have the same radius because they are isoelectronic.", "solution": "All three species are isoelectronic with the same electron count, so their sizes are governed primarily by the effective nuclear charge acting on an essentially identical electron distribution. Let the number of electrons be $N_{e}$ and the nuclear charge be $Z$. For the series $Cl^{-}$, $Ar$, $K^{+}$, each has $N_{e}=18$.\n\nThe effective nuclear charge on the valence electrons can be written as\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}}=Z-S,\n$$\nwhere $S$ is the shielding constant. For an isoelectronic series, the electron configuration and hence the shielding are approximately the same, so $S$ is roughly constant across the series. Therefore, $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ increases monotonically with $Z$.\n\nThe ionic or atomic radius decreases as $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ increases, with the qualitative scaling\n$$\nr \\propto \\frac{1}{Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}}.\n$$\nThus, among isoelectronic species, the one with the largest $Z$ has the smallest radius.\n\nNow identify $Z$ for each species:\n- For $Cl^{-}$, $Z=17$.\n- For $Ar$, $Z=18$.\n- For $K^{+}$, $Z=19$.\n\nHence\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}}(K^{+})>Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}(Ar)>Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}(Cl^{-}),\n$$\nwhich implies\n$$\nr(K^{+})<r(Ar)<r(Cl^{-}).\n$$\nThis is the order of increasing radius: $K^{+}<Ar<Cl^{-}$, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1321084"}, {"introduction": "Periodic trends are not just abstract concepts; they have direct, measurable consequences on the macroscopic properties of materials.
