Consider two stable, uncharged molecules that are constitutional isomers with the chemical formula $C_2H_6O$. Isomer 1 has its heavy atoms (non-hydrogen atoms) connected in a C-C-O sequence. Isomer 2 has its heavy atoms connected in a C-O-C sequence.

A structure with a single bond between the sulfur and oxygen atoms, a double bond between the sulfur and one of the chlorine atoms, and a single bond between the sulfur and the other chlorine atom.", "solution": "To determine the most stable Lewis structure for thionyl chloride ($SOCl_2$), we follow a systematic process involving calculating the total number of valence electrons and then evaluating each proposed structure based on the octet rule and formal charge minimization.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of valence electrons.**\nThe problem provides the number of valence electrons for each atom:\n- Sulfur (S): 1 atom × 6 valence electrons/atom = 6 electrons\n- Oxygen (O): 1 atom × 6 valence electrons/atom = 6 electrons\n- Chlorine (Cl): 2 atoms × 7 valence electrons/atom = 14 electrons\n\nTotal valence electrons = $6 + 6 + 14 = 26$ electrons.\nAny valid Lewis structure for $SOCl_2$ must contain exactly 26 valence electrons.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate each proposed structure.**\nThe general rule for stability is to choose the structure that minimizes the formal charges on all atoms. The formal charge (FC) for an atom in a Lewis structure is calculated as:\n$FC = (\\text{Valence Electrons}) - (\\text{Non-bonding Electrons}) - \\frac{1}{2}(\\text{Bonding Electrons})$\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\nThis structure has single bonds from S to O, and from S to each Cl. To satisfy the octet rule for all atoms, we distribute the remaining electrons as lone pairs.\n- Bonding electrons: 3 single bonds = $3 \\times 2 = 6$ electrons.\n- Remaining electrons for lone pairs: $26 - 6 = 20$ electrons.\n- To satisfy the octet rule for the peripheral atoms, O needs 3 lone pairs (6 e-) and each Cl needs 3 lone pairs (6 e-). Total: $6 + 6 + 6 = 18$ electrons.\n- The remaining $20 - 18 = 2$ electrons are placed on the central sulfur atom as one lone pair.\n- Let's check the octets: O has 1 bond + 3 lone pairs (8 e-), each Cl has 1 bond + 3 lone pairs (8 e-), and S has 3 bonds + 1 lone pair (8 e-). The octet rule is satisfied for all.\n- Now, we calculate formal charges:\n  - $FC(O) = 6 - 6 - \\frac{1}{2}(2) = -1$\n  - $FC(Cl) = 7 - 6 - \\frac{1}{2}(2) = 0$\n  - $FC(S) = 6 - 2 - \\frac{1}{2}(6) = +1$\nThis structure has a formal charge of +1 on sulfur and -1 on oxygen. The presence of non-zero formal charges makes it less stable than a structure where charges are minimized.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\nThis structure has one S=O double bond and two S-Cl single bonds. The sulfur atom has one lone pair.\n- Bonding electrons: 1 double bond (4 e-) + 2 single bonds (4 e-) = 8 electrons.\n- To check the total electron count: We place lone pairs to satisfy octets for peripheral atoms. The double-bonded O needs 2 lone pairs (4 e-). Each single-bonded Cl needs 3 lone pairs (6 e-). Sulfur is stated to have one lone pair (2 e-).\n- Total electrons = 8 (bonding) + 4 (on O) + 2 $\\times$ 6 (on Cls) + 2 (on S) = $8 + 4 + 12 + 2 = 26$ electrons. This matches the total valence electron count.\n- Now, we calculate formal charges:\n  - $FC(O) = 6 - 4 - \\frac{1}{2}(4) = 0$\n  - $FC(Cl) = 7 - 6 - \\frac{1}{2}(2) = 0$\n  - $FC(S) = 6 - 2 - \\frac{1}{2}(8) = 0$\nAll atoms have a formal charge of 0. The central sulfur atom has an \"expanded octet\" with 10 valence electrons (8 from bonds + 2 from a lone pair). This is permissible because sulfur is in the 3rd period of the periodic table and has access to d-orbitals. A structure with zero formal charges on all atoms is highly favorable and generally represents the most stable arrangement.\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\nThis structure proposes one S=O double bond and two S=Cl double bonds.\n- Bonding electrons = 3 double bonds = $3 \\times 4 = 12$ electrons.\n- Remaining electrons for lone pairs: $26 - 12 = 14$ electrons.\n- To satisfy octets on peripheral atoms: O needs 2 lone pairs (4 e-), and each Cl needs 2 lone pairs (4 e-). Total lone pair electrons needed on peripheral atoms = $4 + 4 + 4 = 12$ electrons.\n- The remaining $14-12=2$ electrons would be a lone pair on Sulfur.\n- The total electrons would be 12 (bonding) + 12 (peripheral lone pairs) + 2 (central lone pair) = 26 electrons.\n- However, let's look at the sulfur atom. It would have 3 double bonds + 1 lone pair, which means $6+1=7$ electron domains and $12+2=14$ valence electrons. This is highly unusual and energetically unfavorable. More simply, if the structure has S=O, S=Cl, S=Cl as stated, then to satisfy octets the peripheral atoms need 4 (O) + 4 (Cl) + 4 (Cl) = 12 lone pair electrons. Total electrons would be 12 (bonding) + 12 (lone pairs) = 24. This does not match the required 26 valence electrons. Thus, this structure is invalid from the start.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\nThis structure has one S-O single bond, one S=Cl double bond, and one S-Cl single bond.\n- Let's assume octets are satisfied and calculate formal charges for this arrangement. To have 26 electrons: O (single bond) requires 3 lone pairs. Cl (double bond) requires 2 lone pairs. Cl (single bond) requires 3 lone pairs. S (1 single, 1 double, 1 single) would need 1 lone pair to get an octet. Total electrons would be: 8 (bonding) + 6(O) + 4(Cl=) + 6(Cl-) + 2(S) = 26 electrons.\n- Formal Charges:\n  - $FC(O) = 6 - 6 - \\frac{1}{2}(2) = -1$\n  - $FC(Cl, \\text{double}) = 7 - 4 - \\frac{1}{2}(4) = +1$\n  - $FC(Cl, \\text{single}) = 7 - 6 - \\frac{1}{2}(2) = 0$\n  - $FC(S) = 6 - 2 - \\frac{1}{2}(8) = 0$\nThis structure has charge separation, with a -1 charge on oxygen and a +1 charge on a chlorine atom. Placing a positive formal charge on a highly electronegative atom like chlorine is extremely unfavorable. This makes the structure much less stable than both A and B.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nComparing the valid structures derived from the options, Option B results in a Lewis structure where all atoms have a formal charge of zero. This is the most significant factor in determining the stability of a Lewis structure when comparing an octet-rule-compliant structure with formal charges (Option A) and an expanded-octet structure with zero formal charges (Option B).

This exercise delves into the essential concept of resonance, where the actual electronic structure is a hybrid of multiple contributing forms.

Its stability arises from the delocalization of electrons across the three-membered ring. A complete description of its electronic structure requires consideration of all major resonance contributors.\n\nConsider the following descriptions of possible sets of Lewis structures for the $[C_3H_3]^+$ cation. Each carbon atom in the ring is bonded to exactly one hydrogen atom. Identify which option provides the most accurate and complete representation of the major resonance contributors for this ion.\n\nA. A set of three equivalent resonance structures. Each structure contains one carbon-carbon double bond and two carbon-carbon single bonds within the ring. The formal charge of +1 is located on the sp²-hybridized carbon atom that is not part of the double bond.\n\nB. A single resonance structure that is the average of all contributors. This structure depicts the three-membered ring with three carbon-carbon bonds of identical, intermediate bond order (between a single and a double bond), and the +1 charge is shown delocalized over the entire ring, often by drawing a circle inside the ring with a '+' sign.\n\nC.

One structure contains a carbon-carbon triple bond and a carbon-carbon single bond within the ring, with a formal charge of +1 on one of the sp-hybridized carbons.

Each structure contains three carbon-carbon single bonds within the ring. The formal charge of +1 is located on one carbon atom, while another carbon bears a formal charge of -1 and the third is neutral, maintaining an overall +1 charge for the ion. In these structures, the negatively charged carbon has a lone pair of electrons.", "solution": "First, determine the nature of the conjugated system and the number of delocalized electrons. In $[C_3H_3]^+$, each ring carbon is $sp^2$-hybridized so that a $p$ orbital on each carbon can overlap around the ring. The cation has one fewer electron than the corresponding neutral allylic system, leaving $2$ electrons in the $\\pi$ system. This satisfies Hückel’s aromaticity criterion $4n+2$ with $n=0$, so the cation is aromatic with a fully conjugated three-center $\\pi$ system.\n\nSecond, deduce the major resonance contributors. For a three-center, two-electron $\\pi$ system, the canonical Lewis structures are the three equivalent allylic cation forms in which one C=C double bond is present and the positive charge resides on the carbon not engaged in that double bond. These three structures are of equal weight and interconvert by moving the double bond and the carbocation center around the ring, consistent with delocalization and aromatic stabilization.\n\nThird, evaluate the options against these principles:\n- Option A matches the correct set of three equivalent resonance contributors: in each, there is one C=C and two C-C single bonds, and the $+1$ charge is on the $sp^2$ carbon not in the double bond. This precisely captures the major resonance structures of the cyclopropenyl cation.\n- Option B depicts the resonance hybrid (equalized bond orders and delocalized charge), which is a valid representation of the averaged structure, but it is not a set of Lewis resonance contributors and thus does not list the major contributing Lewis structures themselves.\n- Option C proposes structures with a C≡C triple bond and $sp$ carbons inside a three-membered ring, which is inconsistent with the required $sp^2$ conjugation, introduces an incorrect electron count for the $\\pi$ system, and is geometrically implausible; these are not valid major contributors.\n- Option D introduces charge-separated structures with a carbanion and a carbocation, implying a lone pair on one carbon that would add two $\\pi$ electrons if aligned for conjugation, conflicting with the $2\\pi$-electron aromatic configuration and incurring unfavorable charge separation; such forms, if conceivable, would be high-energy minor contributors at best.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and complete representation of the major resonance contributors is the set described in Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2164035"}]}
