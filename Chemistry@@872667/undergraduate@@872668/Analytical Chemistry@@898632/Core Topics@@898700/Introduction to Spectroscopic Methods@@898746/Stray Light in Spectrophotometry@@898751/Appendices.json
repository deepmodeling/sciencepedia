However, its accuracy can be compromised by instrumental imperfections, one of the most significant being stray light. Stray light is unwanted radiation that reaches the detector without passing through the sample. Its presence causes a systematic negative deviation from Beer's Law, particularly at high concentrations or for highly absorbing samples.\n\nA materials scientist is using an Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometer to characterize a newly developed polymer film with very high optical absorption. The performance of the instrument is limited by a stable fraction of stray light, denoted by $s$, which is the ratio of the stray light power to the incident light power from the monochromator.
