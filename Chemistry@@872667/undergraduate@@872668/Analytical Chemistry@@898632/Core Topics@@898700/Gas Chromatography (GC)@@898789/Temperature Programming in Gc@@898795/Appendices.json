The observed problem is broad, overlapping peaks in the latter half of the chromatogram, implying insufficient resolution for high-boiling analytes under the current temperature ramp.\n\nKey thermodynamic and chromatographic relationships:\n1) Retention factor in GC follows a van’t Hoff relation with temperature:\n$$\n\\ln k' = a - \\frac{\\Delta H_s}{R}\\frac{1}{T},\n$$\nwhere $a$ is a constant, $\\Delta H_s$ is the sorption enthalpy, and $R$ is the gas constant. Thus, as $T$ increases, $k'$ decreases. High-boiling compounds typically have larger $\\Delta H_s$ and are more temperature-sensitive.\n\n2) Selectivity for two analytes $1$ and $2$ is\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{k'_{2}}{k'_{1}} = \\exp\\!\\left[\\left(a_{2}-a_{1}\\right) - \\frac{\\Delta H_{s,2}-\\Delta H_{s,1}}{R}\\frac{1}{T}\\right].\n$$\nAs $T$ increases, $1/T$ decreases and $\\alpha$ tends toward $1$, reducing separation. Therefore, elution at lower $T$ improves selectivity for late-eluting analytes.\n\n3) The resolution between two peaks in isothermal GC can be expressed as\n$$\nR_s = \\frac{1}{4}\\sqrt{N}\\,\\frac{\\alpha - 1}{\\alpha}\\,\\frac{k'}{1+k'},\n$$\nwhere $N$ is the number of theoretical plates. This shows that increasing $k'$ (up to a point) and increasing $\\alpha$ improves $R_s$. In a temperature program, the elution temperature largely determines $k'$ and $\\alpha$ at the moment of elution; pushing peaks to higher temperatures rapidly diminishes both $k'$ and $\\alpha$, compromising $R_s$ for late-eluting analytes.\n\nEffect of the temperature ramp rate:\n- A faster ramp rate raises the oven temperature more quickly, forcing late-eluting analytes to elute at higher $T$, where both $k'$ and $\\alpha$ are smaller. This typically worsens resolution and promotes coelution for high-boiling compounds.\n- A slower ramp rate keeps the oven at lower temperatures longer in the latter part of the run, allowing late-eluting compounds to experience conditions with larger $k'$ and larger $\\alpha$, thereby increasing $R_s$. It also effectively increases the time window in which these analytes separate.\n\nEvaluation of each option:\nA. Increasing the ramp to $25\\,^\\circ\\text{C}/\\text{min}$ accelerates the temperature increase, further reducing $k'$ and $\\alpha$ at elution for high-boiling components, worsening overlap.\nB. Decreasing the ramp to $5\\,^\\circ\\text{C}/\\text{min}$ slows the temperature rise, so late-eluting analytes elute at lower temperatures with higher $k'$ and larger $\\alpha$, improving $R_s$ and peak capacity in the late region; this is the standard, most effective single change to resolve late-eluters in programmed GC.\nC. Increasing the initial temperature to $80\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$ mainly affects early-eluting analytes, risking loss of early resolution; it does not address the late-elution problem.\nD. Decreasing the final temperature to $250\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$ can excessively retain or even prevent elution of the highest-boiling components, and does not improve their separation under the existing ramp.\nE. Decreasing the initial hold time to $0.5$ minutes primarily influences the early part of the chromatogram and does not remedy late-peak overlap.\n\nTherefore, the most effective single modification to improve separation of late-eluting, high-boiling compounds is to decrease the temperature ramp rate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1479552"}, {"introduction": "While temperature programming is invaluable for mixtures with diverse volatilities, it is crucial to recognize when it is not the best approach. This problem challenges you to consider the separation of structural isomers with very similar boiling points. By weighing the pros and cons of an isothermal versus a temperature-programmed method, you will learn to prioritize the most critical factor for resolving difficult pairs: the selectivity factor, $\\alpha$.

The temperature-programmed method is superior because a slow temperature ramp will ensure that all peaks remain sharp and elute in a reasonable time, which is the primary objective for any chromatographic separation.\n\nB. The temperature-programmed method is superior because increasing the kinetic energy of the molecules during the run will amplify the small differences in their physical properties, causing them to separate more effectively.\n\nC. The isothermal method is superior because a single, carefully optimized (and relatively low) temperature can be selected to maximize the selectivity factor ($\\alpha$) between the isomers, which is the most critical parameter for resolving compounds with very similar boiling points.\n\nD. The isothermal method is superior, but it must be run at a high temperature (e.g., 135 °C) just below the boiling points to minimize analysis time and ensure all isomers are sufficiently volatile for sharp peaks.\n\nE. Both methods would be equally effective. Since the boiling points are extremely close, the choice of temperature profile is negligible compared to other factors like the choice of stationary phase or column length.", "solution": "The goal is to maximize resolution between three very similar structural isomers in GC. The chromatographic resolution between two neighboring peaks is given by\n$$\nR_s=\\frac{1}{4}\\sqrt{N}\\,\\frac{\\alpha-1}{\\alpha}\\,\\frac{k_{2}'}{1+k_{2}'},\n$$\nwhere $N$ is the plate number (efficiency), $\\alpha=k_{2}'/k_{1}'1$ is the selectivity factor for the pair, and $k_{2}'$ is the retention factor of the later eluting compound. For isomers with nearly identical volatilities, the term that most critically determines whether they can be resolved is the selectivity factor $\\alpha$.

At the same time, lowering $T$ increases $k'$, and the factor $\\frac{k'}{1+k'}$ improves until $k'$ becomes too large; the usual strategy is to choose an isothermal temperature that yields moderate $k'$ (commonly in the range where $\\frac{k'}{1+k'}$ is near its maximum) while maximizing $\\alpha$.\n\nIn contrast, temperature programming is designed for mixtures with a wide volatility range to keep all analytes within an acceptable $k'$ window and analysis time. For these three isomers with very similar volatilities, a temperature ramp changes $T$ during elution, which changes $k'$ and $\\alpha$ across each peak. Because $\\alpha(T)$ generally decreases with increasing $T$, a ramp tends to reduce selectivity during the separation and cannot create selectivity beyond what is available at the best fixed $T$. Thus, even if a temperature program produces narrow peaks or reasonable times, it does not optimize the most critical term, $\\frac{\\alpha-1}{\\alpha}$, for such closely related compounds.\n\nThis analysis eliminates the alternatives:\n- A is incorrect because peak sharpness and reasonable time are not sufficient; without maximizing $\\alpha$, resolution between near-isomers remains limited, and a ramp often reduces $\\alpha$.\n- B is incorrect because increasing $T$ does not amplify differences; it generally drives $\\alpha$ toward $1$, reducing separation.\n- D is incorrect because running at a high isothermal temperature to shorten time reduces $k'$ and typically reduces $\\alpha$, harming resolution; GC elution does not require temperatures near atmospheric boiling points.\n- E is incorrect because temperature profile significantly affects $\\alpha$ and $k'$, so the choice is not negligible; isothermal at an optimized low temperature is preferable for these isomers.\n\nTherefore, the isothermal method, operated at a carefully optimized (relatively low) temperature to maximize $\\alpha$ while keeping $k'$ in a practical range, provides the most accurate analytical justification in this scenario.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1479529"}]}
