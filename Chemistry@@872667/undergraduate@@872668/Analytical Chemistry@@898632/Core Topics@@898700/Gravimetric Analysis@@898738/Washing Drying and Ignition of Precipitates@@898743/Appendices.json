The precipitate is then collected on a piece of ashless filter paper.\n\nThe next step is the ignition of the precipitate and filter paper in a crucible. A critical error occurs at this stage: the student heats the crucible too rapidly in the presence of limited air. This improper technique fails to completely combust the filter paper, leaving a visible residue of black carbon mixed with the final white precipitate.

The calculation is based on the mass of the precipitate, which is assumed to be pure barium sulfate ($BaSO_4$).

Let's analyze the two sources of error described.\n\n**Error 1: Inclusion of residual carbon.**\nThe incomplete combustion of the filter paper leaves unreacted carbon (C) in the crucible. This carbon has mass and is weighed along with the precipitate. This effect, considered in isolation, would make the weighed mass greater than the ideal mass of pure $BaSO_4$. This would lead to a calculated mass of sulfate that is erroneously high.\n\n**Error 2: Chemical reduction of $BaSO_4$ to $BaS$.**\nThe reaction $BaSO_4(s) + 4C(s) \\rightarrow BaS(s) + 4CO(g)$ consumes some of the intended precipitate ($BaSO_4$) and converts it into a different compound, barium sulfide ($BaS$). To determine the effect of this conversion on the mass, we must compare the molar masses of the reactant and product solids.\n- Molar Mass of $BaSO_4$: $M_{BaSO_4} \\approx 137.33 + 32.07 + 4(16.00) = 233.40 \\text{ g/mol}$\n- Molar Mass of $BaS$: $M_{BaS} \\approx 137.33 + 32.07 = 169.40 \\text{ g/mol}$\n\nFor every mole of $BaSO_4$ that is converted to $BaS$, the mass of the solid precipitate decreases by $233.40 \\text{ g} - 169.40 \\text{ g} = 64.00 \\text{ g}$. This chemical reaction therefore leads to a significant loss of mass. This effect, considered in isolation, would make the weighed mass lower than the ideal mass of pure $BaSO_4$, leading to a calculated mass of sulfate that is erroneously low.\n\n**Net Effect:**\nWe must compare the magnitude of the two opposing effects. Let's analyze the stoichiometry of the reduction reaction. To achieve the mass loss of 64.00 g by converting one mole of $BaSO_4$, four moles of carbon are consumed. The mass of four moles of carbon is $4 \\times 12.01 \\text{ g/mol} = 48.04 \\text{ g}$. So, the reaction consumes 48.04 g of carbon to produce a mass loss of 64.00 g in the precipitate. The total mass of solids changes by $m_{BaS} - m_{BaSO_4} = -64.00$ g for every 4 moles of C reacted. The carbon is converted to gaseous $CO$ and is removed.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the net effect for a given amount of carbon from the filter paper. A portion of the carbon, let's call it $C_{reacted}$, reacts with $BaSO_4$, causing a mass loss. The remaining portion, $C_{residual}$, is simply mixed in, causing a mass gain.\n- The mass change from the reaction is a loss. For every gram of carbon that reacts, the mass of the precipitate decreases by $\\frac{64.00 \\text{ g}}{48.04 \\text{ g}} \\approx 1.33$ g.\n- The mass change from residual carbon is a gain. For every gram of carbon that remains unreacted, the mass of the precipitate increases by 1 g.\n\nSince the mass loss per gram of carbon involved in the reaction (a factor of 1.33) is greater than the mass gain per gram of residual carbon (a factor of 1), the reduction effect is more potent than the inclusion effect for a given amount of carbon. In practice, the reduction of sulfate is a well-known and significant error in this gravimetric procedure, and analytical chemistry protocols are designed specifically to prevent it. When it does occur, it typically leads to a substantial decrease in the final mass. Therefore, the net effect is a final weighed mass that is lower than the ideal mass.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSince the final weighed mass is erroneously low, the calculated mass of sulfate will also be erroneously low. Consequently, the final calculated mass percentage of sulfate in the original sample will be erroneously low.\n\nLet's examine the options:\nA. Incorrect. This would only happen if the carbon inclusion were the only error.\nB. Correct. The mass loss from chemical reduction is the dominant effect.\nC. Incorrect. There is no chemical or physical reason for the two effects to cancel perfectly.\nD. Incorrect. The gravimetric factor is based on the molar mass of $BaSO_4$. Using the mass of a mixture containing $BaS$ with the GF for $BaSO_4$ is the source of the error. The GFs for the two compounds would be different.\nE. Incorrect.
