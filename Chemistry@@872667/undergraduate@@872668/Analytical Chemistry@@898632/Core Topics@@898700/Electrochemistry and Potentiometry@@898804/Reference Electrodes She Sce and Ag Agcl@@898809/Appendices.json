The Ag/AgCl electrode consists of a silver wire coated with silver chloride, immersed in a filling solution of saturated potassium chloride (KCl). This internal assembly is contained within a glass body that makes contact with the external analyte solution through a porous ceramic frit.

The porous ceramic frit has become clogged with silver chloride precipitate or has dried out.\nD. The surface of the glass pH electrode has a layer of adsorbed protein from a previous experiment.\nE. The temperature of the analyte solution is 15 °C instead of the standard 25 °C.", "solution": "We identify the measured quantity as the total ohmic resistance of the ionic path connecting the two half-cells. In a potentiometric cell with a reference electrode that contacts the analyte through a porous frit, the dominant resistive elements are the porous junction and the solution path between the electrodes. The total resistance can be modeled as a series sum\n$$\nR_{\\text{total}}=R_{\\text{junction}}+R_{\\text{solution}}+R_{\\text{other}},\n$$\nwhere $R_{\\text{junction}}$ is the resistance of the porous frit (liquid junction), $R_{\\text{solution}}$ is the bulk solution resistance, and $R_{\\text{other}}$ includes any minor interfacial contributions that are not rate-limiting for ion transport. For an electrolyte-filled porous frit, the junction resistance is governed by\n$$\nR_{\\text{junction}}=\\rho_{\\text{eff}}\\frac{l_{\\text{eff}}}{A_{\\text{eff}}}, \\quad \\rho_{\\text{eff}}=\\frac{1}{\\kappa_{\\text{eff}}},\n$$\nwhere $\\kappa_{\\text{eff}}$ is the effective ionic conductivity within the porous network, $l_{\\text{eff}}$ is an effective tortuous path length, and $A_{\\text{eff}}$ is the effective cross-sectional area available for ion transport. Any process that greatly reduces $\\kappa_{\\text{eff}}$ (e.g., drying) or reduces $A_{\\text{eff}}$ and increases $l_{\\text{eff}}$ (e.g., clogging/precipitation in pores) will cause $R_{\\text{junction}}$ to increase dramatically, potentially by orders of magnitude.\n\nWe now assess each option against the observed jump from a few $10^{3}\\ \\Omega$ to several $10^{6}\\ \\Omega$:\n\nA. Slight decrease in the concentration of a saturated KCl filling solution due to water evaporation is internally inconsistent (evaporation of water tends to increase concentration until saturation; a saturated solution remains saturated as long as solid is present). Even if the concentration changed slightly, the conductivity $\\kappa$ of concentrated KCl varies smoothly with concentration; the resistance change obeys $R\\propto 1/\\kappa$, so small concentration changes cannot produce a $10^{3}$-fold increase. Thus A cannot account for the observed megohm resistance.\n\nB. Partial tarnishing (formation of $\\text{Ag}_2\\text{S}$ or related surface films) on the Ag wire affects the equilibrium potential (Ag/AgCl reference potential) more than the ohmic resistance of the ionic path. Electron transfer at a metal electrode is typically fast, and any added interfacial resistance is negligible compared to ionic transport through the junction. This will not raise $R_{\\text{total}}$ by three orders of magnitude.\n\nC. A clogged or dried porous ceramic frit directly targets $R_{\\text{junction}}$. Clogging with AgCl precipitate reduces $A_{\\text{eff}}$ and increases tortuosity $l_{\\text{eff}}$, yielding\n$$\nR_{\\text{junction}}\\propto \\frac{l_{\\text{eff}}}{A_{\\text{eff}}}\\uparrow,\n$$\nwhile drying removes the continuous aqueous phase, driving $\\kappa_{\\text{eff}}\\to 0$ and hence $\\rho_{\\text{eff}}\\to \\infty$, so\n$$\nR_{\\text{junction}}=\\frac{1}{\\kappa_{\\text{eff}}}\\frac{l_{\\text{eff}}}{A_{\\text{eff}}}\\to \\infty.\n$$\nEither mechanism can elevate the resistance from $10^{3}\\ \\Omega$ to $10^{6}\\ \\Omega$ or more. This matches the observation.\n\nD. An adsorbed protein layer on the glass pH electrode surface primarily affects the electrode response (sluggishness, drift) by altering ion exchange at the hydrated gel layer. It does not create a severe bottleneck in the ionic conduction path between the two half-cells that would explain a jump to megohm resistance. Any change in effective membrane impedance is minor compared to the drastic effect of a blocked junction.\n\nE. The temperature dependence of ionic conductivity can be approximated for small temperature changes by either an Arrhenius form $\\kappa(T)\\propto \\exp(-E_{a}/(k_{B}T))$ or a linearized empirical form $\\kappa(T)\\approx \\kappa(T_{0})[1+\\alpha(T-T_{0})]$ with $\\alpha$ of order $10^{-2}$ per kelvin. A change of about $10$ kelvin reduces $\\kappa$ by at most a modest factor, so\n$$\n\\frac{R(15)}{R(25)}\\approx \\frac{\\kappa(25)}{\\kappa(15)}\n$$\nis on the order of unity, not $10^{3}$. Temperature cannot explain megohm readings.\n\nTherefore, the only option that plausibly and specifically explains the anomalously high resistance is a blocked or dried porous ceramic frit, which greatly increases the junction resistance and can readily yield megohm-scale values.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1467677"}]}
