A major consideration in FAAS is the potential for chemical interference, where the analyte element forms stable compounds in the flame, preventing its atomization into free ground-state atoms. This leads to a lower-than-expected absorbance signal. One of the most common chemical interferences is the formation of refractory metal oxides. The thermal stability of these oxides can be estimated by the bond enthalpy of the metal-oxygen (M-O) bond.

A common case is the formation of refractory metal oxides. Consider the gas-phase dissociation of a metal oxide unit:\n$$\n\\text{MO} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{M} + \\text{O}.\n$$\nThe equilibrium constant for dissociation, $K_{\\text{diss}}$, controls the fraction of free atoms $\\text{M}$ available for absorption, with the absorbance proportional to the number density of $\\text{M}$.

At fixed $T$, larger $\\Delta H$ implies smaller $K_{\\text{diss}}$, hence a smaller fraction of atomized $\\text{M}$ and stronger chemical interference. Therefore, the element with the larger $D_{\\text{M-O}}$ forms a more refractory oxide and is more difficult to atomize, requiring a hotter or more fuel-rich flame to increase $T$ and to reduce oxide formation.\n\nGiven:\n$$\nD_{\\text{Al-O}} = 511 \\text{ kJ/mol}, \\quad D_{\\text{K-O}} = 284 \\text{ kJ/mol},\n$$\nwe have $D_{\\text{Al-O}} > D_{\\text{K-O}}$, so aluminum oxide is more refractory and aluminum is more susceptible to this interference.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A correctly states that aluminum, due to the high Al–O bond enthalpy, forms a stable refractory oxide that is difficult to atomize.\n- B is incorrect because K–O has a lower bond enthalpy.\n- C discusses ionization interference (related to first ionization energy), which is a different phenomenon than oxide formation and does not address the asked chemical interference.\n- D is incorrect; potassium is not lost due to low boiling point in a way that constitutes the described chemical interference.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1475019"}, {"introduction": "When the sample matrix is complex, as is often the case with environmental or biological samples, chemical interferences can suppress the analyte signal in unpredictable ways.
