This practice presents a realistic troubleshooting scenario that cuts to the core principle of a hollow-cathode lamp: the emitted light is a direct fingerprint of the cathode's elemental composition. By diagnosing an unexpected signal, you will reinforce your understanding that the sputtering process liberates all elements present in the cathode, not just the primary one [@problem_id:1454129].", "problem": "An analytical chemist is setting up a new Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AAS). As part of the instrument validation, they are testing a new Hollow-Cathode Lamp (HCL) that is certified by the manufacturer to be a high-purity magnesium (Mg) lamp. The HCL contains a low pressure of neon as the inert fill gas.\n\nThe chemist places the Mg-HCL in the instrument, turns it on, and allows it to stabilize. Instead of immediately proceeding with a magnesium analysis, they decide to scan the lamp's emission spectrum. Surprisingly, when the monochromator is set to 213.9 nm, which is a primary analytical wavelength for zinc (Zn), a strong and sharp emission line is detected. The chemist has verified that the AAS instrument itself is functioning correctly and is free from contamination.\n\nGiven this observation, which of the following provides the most physically plausible explanation for the unexpected emission of zinc's characteristic radiation from the magnesium HCL?\n\nA. The high temperature of the discharge causes the neon fill gas to undergo nuclear fusion, producing trace amounts of excited zinc atoms.\n\nB. The material used to fabricate the lamp's cathode, while primarily magnesium, is not perfectly pure and contains a small amount of zinc as a contaminant.\n\nC. The tungsten wire used for the anode is contaminated with zinc, which is vaporized by the high current and enters the plasma discharge.\n\nD. Electrons in the plasma discharge are energetic enough to excite the inner-shell electrons of the magnesium atoms, causing them to emit radiation at a wavelength corresponding to that of zinc.\n\nE. The borosilicate glass envelope of the HCL contains zinc impurities, which are liberated into the gas phase by the intense ultraviolet radiation from the discharge and subsequently excited.", "solution": "We start from the operating principle of a hollow-cathode lamp (HCL). A noble gas (here, neon) at low pressure is ionized by an electrical discharge. The resulting positive ions are accelerated toward the negatively biased hollow cathode and sputter neutral atoms of the cathode material into the discharge. These sputtered atoms are then excited by electron impact in the plasma and emit their element-specific spectral lines upon relaxation. Therefore, the set of sharp emission lines observed from an HCL corresponds to the elemental composition of the cathode material (and any elements present as trace contaminants in that cathode).\n\nGiven that the unexpected emission is at $213.9\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, a primary analytical line for zinc, a physically consistent explanation is that zinc atoms are present in the sputtered vapor. Because sputtering predominantly originates from the cathode surface, any zinc impurities in the cathode will be efficiently introduced into the discharge and produce their characteristic radiation.\n\nWe now assess each option against this mechanism and basic physical constraints:\n\n- Option A posits nuclear fusion of the neon fill gas producing zinc. Fusion requires reaction energies and conditions many orders of magnitude beyond those present in a low-pressure electrical discharge. The discharge electron energies are on the order of electron volts, whereas fusion requires energies in the kiloelectron-volt to megaelectron-volt regime with extremely high temperatures and densities. Hence, neon fusion to zinc in an HCL is physically untenable.\n\n- Option B posits that the magnesium cathode contains a small amount of zinc. This is the most consistent explanation with HCL physics: positive-ion bombardment sputters whatever elements are present at the cathode surface. If zinc is present as a trace impurity, those zinc atoms will be sputtered, excited, and will emit at their characteristic wavelengths, including $213.9\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n\n- Option C suggests zinc contamination of the tungsten anode. In an HCL, sputtering and emission are dominated by the cathode; the anode is at positive potential and does not experience the same sputtering by positive ions. Electron bombardment of the anode does not efficiently sputter metal into the discharge, and standard HCL designs and operating conditions are specifically optimized for cathode sputtering. Thus, the anode is an implausible source of strong, sharp zinc lines.\n\n- Option D proposes that inner-shell excitations in magnesium produce radiation at zinc’s wavelength. Atomic line positions are element-specific because they arise from discrete energy-level differences unique to each element. A magnesium transition cannot reproduce a zinc line. Moreover, inner-shell (core-level) excitations correspond to much higher photon energies (X-ray regime), whereas $213.9\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ is in the ultraviolet and corresponds to valence-level transitions. Using $E = h\\nu = hc/\\lambda$, a photon at $\\lambda = 213.9\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ has an energy characteristic of UV electronic transitions, not inner-shell X-ray transitions. Therefore, magnesium cannot emit zinc’s $213.9\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ line via inner-shell excitation.\n\n- Option E suggests zinc impurities in the borosilicate glass envelope are liberated and excited. Borosilicate glass typically does not contain appreciable zinc, and even if trace amounts were present, the discharge region and sputtering dynamics do not favor liberation of free metallic zinc from the glass envelope into the plasma as a strong, sharp atomic emission source. The observed strong line is much more consistent with cathode-originating species.\n\nTherefore, the most physically plausible and standard explanation is that the cathode, while nominally magnesium, contains a small amount of zinc impurity that is sputtered and emits its characteristic radiation at $213.9\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. This corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1454129"}, {"introduction": "Now that we've established that the cathode material determines the spectrum, we must ask: how are these atoms energized to emit light? This exercise presents a hypothetical but highly instructive scenario involving an incorrect fill gas to explore the lamp's \"engine\"—the plasma discharge. Understanding the outcome helps clarify the critical role of the inert fill gas in efficiently transferring energy to the sputtered cathode atoms, a process fundamental to the lamp's operation [@problem_id:1454091].", "problem": "A scientist is designing a custom Hollow-Cathode Lamp (HCL) for use in an Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) instrument. A standard HCL consists of a cylindrical hollow cathode made of the element to be analyzed and an anode, both sealed in a glass tube filled with an inert gas like neon or argon at a low pressure. When a potential difference is applied across the electrodes, the fill gas is ionized. These positive gas ions are accelerated into the cathode, dislodging metal atoms from the cathode surface in a process called sputtering. Subsequent collisions in the plasma excite these sputtered metal atoms, which then emit light at their characteristic atomic wavelengths upon returning to their ground state.\n\nIn a manufacturing error, a custom HCL is assembled with a cathode made of a specific metal, designated as Metal M. The lamp is then accidentally filled not with a standard inert gas, but with a different gaseous element, designated as Gas G. The crucial chemical property of this faulty configuration is that the first ionization potential of Gas G is significantly lower than the first ionization potential of Metal M.\n\nAssume the lamp is operated at the standard voltage and current. Which of the following statements best describes the primary operational outcome of this improperly constructed HCL?\n\nA. The lamp will fail to light up because the fill gas, having a low ionization potential, cannot sustain a stable plasma discharge.\n\nB. The sputtering process will be entirely suppressed, and no atoms of Metal M will be ejected from the cathode surface.\n\nC. The lamp will operate with greatly enhanced efficiency, producing an intensely bright emission spectrum of Metal M, because the fill gas is easier to ionize.\n\nD. The lamp will generate a continuous blackbody radiation spectrum instead of discrete atomic lines due to the unusual gas mixture.\n\nE. The lamp will produce a strong emission spectrum characteristic of the fill Gas G, with little to no emission from the sputtered atoms of Metal M.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine the operational outcome of a Hollow-Cathode Lamp (HCL) that has been incorrectly filled with a gas (Gas G) whose ionization potential is lower than that of the cathode material (Metal M). Let's analyze the physical processes step-by-step.\n\nStep 1: Initiation of the Discharge\nWhen a voltage is applied across the anode and cathode, an electric field is established inside the lamp. This field accelerates any free electrons present. These electrons collide with the atoms of the fill gas, Gas G. The ionization potential is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from an atom. Since Gas G has a low ionization potential, it is *easier* to ionize than a standard fill gas like argon or neon. This means that a stable plasma, or discharge, will be readily created and sustained. Therefore, the lamp will light up. This conclusion immediately invalidates option A, which claims the lamp will fail to light up.\n\nStep 2: The Sputtering Process\nOnce the plasma is formed, it consists of electrons and positive ions of the fill gas, $G^+$. The negatively charged cathode attracts these $G^+$ ions, accelerating them to high velocities. These energetic ions bombard the cathode surface. Sputtering is a physical process based on momentum transfer from the bombarding ions to the atoms on the cathode surface. This bombardment has sufficient energy to physically eject, or \"sputter,\" neutral atoms of Metal M from the solid cathode into the gaseous plasma. The efficiency of sputtering depends on the mass and energy of the bombarding ions, not on the relative ionization potentials of the gas and cathode material. As long as a discharge is formed and ions are accelerated to the cathode, sputtering will occur. This invalidates option B, which claims sputtering will be suppressed.\n\nStep 3: Excitation and Emission\nThe primary goal of an HCL is to generate light from the sputtered cathode material, Metal M. This requires atoms of Metal M to be excited to higher energy levels, typically through collisions with energetic electrons or ions in the plasma. After excitation, these atoms, $M^*$, relax to lower energy states, emitting photons with wavelengths characteristic of Metal M.\n\nIn this faulty lamp, we have two primary species in the gas phase that can be excited: the atoms of Gas G and the sputtered atoms of Metal M. There are two critical factors to consider:\n1.  **Concentration:** The fill gas, Gas G, is present at a much higher concentration throughout the lamp volume than the sputtered Metal M, whose concentration is significant only near the cathode.\n2.  **Excitation Energy:** The energy required to excite an atom is related to its electronic structure. Atoms with a low ionization potential, like Gas G, also generally have low-lying excited states, meaning they require less energy to excite compared to atoms with high ionization potentials.\n\nGiven these factors, when an energetic electron travels through the plasma, it is statistically far more likely to collide with an atom of Gas G than an atom of Metal M. Furthermore, because Gas G atoms require less energy to excite, these collisions are more likely to result in the excitation of Gas G. The electrical energy supplied to the lamp is therefore overwhelmingly channeled into exciting the abundant and easily excitable fill gas. Consequently, the dominant light emission will come from the de-excitation of Gas G atoms ($G^* \\rightarrow G + h\\nu_G$). The sputtered Metal M atoms will be largely unexcited, resulting in a very weak or non-existent emission spectrum for Metal M.\n\nStep 4: Evaluating the Options\nBased on this analysis:\n- Option A is incorrect. The lamp will light up easily.\n- Option B is incorrect. Sputtering will still occur.\n- Option C is incorrect. While the discharge is easy to initiate, the energy is not transferred effectively to Metal M atoms. The efficiency for producing the desired Metal M spectrum is thus extremely low, not enhanced.\n- Option D is incorrect. Low-pressure gas discharges like those in an HCL produce discrete atomic line spectra, not continuous blackbody radiation.\n- Option E is correct. The lamp will function primarily as a source of light for Gas G, failing its intended purpose as a line source for Metal M in an AAS instrument.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1454091"}, {"introduction": "Finally, we connect the lamp's internal physics to its ultimate purpose in Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS).
