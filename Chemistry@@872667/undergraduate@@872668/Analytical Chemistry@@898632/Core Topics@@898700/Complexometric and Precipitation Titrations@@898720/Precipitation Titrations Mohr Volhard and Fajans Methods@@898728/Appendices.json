The core principle is that a known excess amount of a precipitating agent ($AgNO_3$) is added to the analyte ($KBr$).

The procedure involves titrating a sample of the sodium chloride (NaCl) solution with a standardized silver nitrate (AgNO₃) solution. For this titration, the student uses a special, newly synthesized anionic organic dye as an adsorption indicator. A critical property of this new indicator is that its anion (let's denote it as In⁻) adsorbs to the surface of the solid silver chloride (AgCl) precipitate with a significantly higher affinity than the chloride anion (Cl⁻) itself.\n\nAssuming the titration is carried out under standard conditions, which of the following outcomes is the most probable result of this experiment?\n\nA. The endpoint, identified by a color change, will be observed significantly before the stoichiometric equivalence point is reached.\nB.

The surface charge of the $\\text{AgCl}$ particles depends on the ion in excess in solution: before equivalence, excess $\\text{Cl}^-$ specifically adsorbs and renders the surface negative; just after equivalence, excess $\\text{Ag}^+$ specifically adsorbs and renders the surface positive. An anionic indicator $\\text{In}^-$ is therefore repelled before equivalence and attracted after equivalence in the standard case, producing a color change slightly after the equivalence point.\n\nLet $K_{\\text{Cl}}$ and $K_{\\text{In}}$ denote adsorption equilibrium constants (activities implicit) for $\\text{Cl}^-$ and $\\text{In}^-$ on the $\\text{AgCl}$ surface, respectively. The problem states that the indicator anion has a significantly higher affinity than chloride, i.e.,\n$$K_{\\text{In}} \\gg K_{\\text{Cl}}.$$\nIn a competitive adsorption picture (e.g., a Langmuir-type model), the fractional coverage of the indicator on available adsorption sites satisfies\n$$\\theta_{\\text{In}^-}=\\frac{K_{\\text{In}} a_{\\text{In}^-}}{1+K_{\\text{In}} a_{\\text{In}^-}+K_{\\text{Cl}} a_{\\text{Cl}^-}+\\cdots},$$\nand a visible endpoint occurs when $\\theta_{\\text{In}^-}$ exceeds some threshold $\\theta^{*}$.

Consequently, the color change appears prematurely.\n\nTherefore, under the stated condition $K_{\\text{In}} \\gg K_{\\text{Cl}}$, the endpoint will be observed significantly before the stoichiometric equivalence point.\n\nOption analysis:\n- A is consistent with the above reasoning.\n- B would require the indicator to need a larger excess of $\\text{Ag}^{+}$ (weaker anion adsorption), which contradicts $K_{\\text{In}} \\gg K_{\\text{Cl}}$.\n- C is false because adsorption indicators’ function depends sensitively on relative adsorption affinities.\n- D is false because a much higher affinity promotes, rather than prevents, adsorption and color change.\n\nHence the most probable result is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1460857"}]}
