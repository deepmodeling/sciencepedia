For this purpose, a sample of high-purity primary standard, potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP), with a molar mass of 204.22 g/mol, is used. The KHP is a monoprotic acid. The chemist weighs out a sample of KHP, dissolves it in deionized water, adds a phenolphthalein indicator, and titrates it to the endpoint with the NaOH solution.\n\nLater, it is discovered that the analytical balance used for weighing the KHP was improperly calibrated and consistently reads 1.0% higher than the true mass of any substance being weighed. Assuming the titration itself was performed perfectly and all other measurements (like the volume of NaOH solution delivered) were accurate, what is the resulting effect on the calculated molarity of the NaOH titrant?\n\nA.
