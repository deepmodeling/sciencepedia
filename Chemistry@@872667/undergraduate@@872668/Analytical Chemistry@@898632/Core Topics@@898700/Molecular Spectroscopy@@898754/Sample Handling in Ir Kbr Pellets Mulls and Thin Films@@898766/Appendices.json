Hexachlorobenzene, $\\text{C}_6\\text{Cl}_6$, is anhydrous and contains no hydrogen atoms, so it cannot give rise to intrinsic O–H or N–H stretches.\n\nThe characteristic IR regions relevant here are:\n- O–H stretching vibrations: typically broad and strong due to hydrogen bonding, centered in the range $3200$ to $3600\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$, often around $3400\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ in condensed phases.\n- N–H stretching vibrations: typically in the $3300$ to $3500\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ region; primary amines often show a pair of sharper bands, and these are not expected without nitrogen in the sample.\n- Aromatic C–H stretching vibrations: typically near $3030\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$, not at $3400\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$.\n- Atmospheric $\\text{CO}_2$: strong asymmetric stretch near $2350\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ and a bending mode near $667\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$; not near $3400\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$.\n- KBr lattice modes: far-IR; pressing force does not create a strong, broad band at $3400\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$.\n\nGiven these assignments, a broad, strong band near $3400\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ is diagnostic of O–H stretching from hydrogen-bonded water. KBr is known to be hygroscopic; it readily absorbs water from ambient air. Water incorporated in the KBr pellet produces a broad O–H stretching band in this region. This explains both the position and the broadness of the extra absorption. In contrast:\n- Option A is inconsistent because $\\text{CO}_2$ does not absorb near $3400\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$.\n- Option C is unlikely because there is no nitrogen source; furthermore, N–H bands are typically sharper and show characteristic patterns (e.g., primary amine doublet).\n- Option D is inconsistent with the position, since aromatic C–H stretches occur near $3030\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$.\n- Option E is not physically plausible for generating a broad O–H-like band at $3400\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$; KBr lattice fundamentals are in the far-IR and pressing does not shift modes into this region.\n\nTherefore, the most probable explanation is that the KBr pellet contains absorbed water, yielding the broad O–H stretching band near $3400\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1468592"}, {"introduction": "When KBr pellets are unsuitable due to reactivity or other issues, the mull technique provides an excellent alternative. The core principle of this method is selecting a mulling liquid that is transparent in the spectral regions where your analyte absorbs. This practice [@problem_id:1468574] puts you in the role of the analyst, requiring a strategic choice between two common mulling agents to successfully observe the vibrations of a specific chemical bond.", "problem": "An analytical chemistry student is tasked with characterizing a newly synthesized polymer using Infrared (IR) spectroscopy. The polymer's structure contains a significant number of carbon-fluorine (C-F) bonds, and the primary goal of the analysis is to observe the C-F stretching vibrations, which are known to appear in the spectral range of $1400\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ to $1000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$. The student decides to use the mull technique for sample preparation. Two common mulling agents are available in the laboratory: Nujol, which is a mixture of long-chain alkanes (hydrocarbons), and Fluorolube, which is a mixture of perfluorinated hydrocarbons. For a successful analysis, the mulling agent should not have strong absorptions in the spectral region of interest.\n\nThe IR spectrum of Nujol exhibits strong absorptions due to C-H bonds around $2950-2850\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$, $1460\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$, and $1375\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$.

Nujol is inappropriate because its C-H bending vibration at $1460\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ completely obscures the entire $1400-1000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ region of interest for the polymer's C-F bonds.\n\nB. Fluorolube is inappropriate because its own strong C-F absorptions would overlap with and mask the C-F stretching vibrations of the polymer sample.\n\nC. Nujol is inappropriate because the non-polar alkanes in Nujol will chemically react with the highly polar C-F bonds in the polymer, altering the sample's spectrum.\n\nD. Fluorolube is inappropriate because perfluorinated hydrocarbons are generally unreactive and will not interact with the IR beam, resulting in no spectrum.", "solution": "We identify the target spectral window for the analyte: the polymer’s C–F stretching vibrations are expected in the range $1400$ to $1000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$. For a mulling agent to be suitable, its own strong absorptions must not overlap this region. The relevant principle is that strong IR bands from the matrix that coincide with the analyte’s bands will overlap and mask the analyte signals, because IR absorption is governed by the requirement of a changing dipole moment during vibration.\n\nGiven data for Nujol:\n- Strong C–H stretches near $2950$–$2850\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ lie outside the region of interest.\n- A strong band near $1460\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ lies above the upper boundary ($1400\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$) of the region of interest, so it is outside the specified window.\n- A strong band near $1375\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ lies within the $1400$–$1000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ region, so it may interfere locally but does not cover the entire region.\n\nGiven data for Fluorolube:\n- Strong C–F absorptions spanning approximately $1300$ to $1000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ directly coincide with the polymer’s C–F stretching region, producing extensive overlap that would mask the analyte’s C–F bands.\n\nAssessing the statements:\n- A is incorrect because Nujol does not “completely obscure” the entire $1400$–$1000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ region; only its $1375\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ band lies within, and the $1460\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ band is outside the specified window.\n- B is correct because Fluorolube’s strong C–F absorptions from $1300$ to $1000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ would overlap and mask the polymer’s C–F stretching vibrations.\n- C is incorrect because Nujol (long-chain alkanes) is generally chemically inert toward the polymer and does not react with C–F bonds; chemical reaction is not the concern in IR mulling.\n- D is incorrect because perfluorinated hydrocarbons do interact with IR radiation via strong C–F dipole changes, yielding strong IR absorptions rather than “no spectrum.”\n\nTherefore, the inappropriate mulling agent for observing the polymer’s C–F stretches is Fluorolube, for the reason stated in B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1468574"}, {"introduction": "Real-world chemical analysis rarely involves perfect samples; more often, chemists face materials with multiple constraints, such as thermal instability or reactivity.

While the $2240\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ ($C \\equiv N$) and $1685\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ ($C=O$) bands would likely be observable, this approach cannot deliver a complete spectrum because significant regions ($3000$ to $2850\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ and around $1460$ and $1375\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$) are obscured. Therefore, it fails the completeness requirement.\n\nB. Fluorolube mull only. Fluorolube is transparent above $1350\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$, so the $2240\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ and $1685\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ bands and the C–H stretches can be recorded cleanly.

The prior failure indicates a chemical reaction with the alkali halide matrix under high pressure, as evidenced by a visible color change and loss of the nitrile band. Cooling the mortar with liquid nitrogen may suppress thermally driven decomposition but does not address pressure-induced or matrix-facilitated chemical reactions. The pellet pressing step still applies high pressure, so the risk of reaction remains high. This is therefore not appropriate.\n\nD. Two mulls, one in Nujol and one in Fluorolube, then digitally combine transparent regions. Fluorolube provides a clean spectrum from $4000$ to $1350\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$, covering the C–H stretches, the $C\\equiv N$ near $2240\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$, and the $C=O$ near $1685\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$. Nujol is relatively transparent below $1350\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ (its strong bands are at approximately $1460$ and $1375\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$, above this lower window), allowing access to the fingerprint region down to $650\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$. By recording both spectra and compositing the transparent regions—use Fluorolube for $4000$ to $1350\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ and Nujol for $1350$ to $650\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$—one obtains a complete spectrum. This avoids reactive alkali halide matrices and minimizes thermal/mechanical stress, satisfying the thermal sensitivity constraint.

Dissolution introduces risks of solvolysis, coordination changes, or conformational changes relative to the solid state, potentially altering vibrational frequencies and intensities. Suitable solvents typically have strong absorptions that complicate acquisition of an unperturbed, complete spectrum across $4000$ to $650\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ with reasonable path lengths. Since the sample is air-stable solid and solid-state methods are available that avoid matrix reactions, solution IR is not the most appropriate strategy here.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate experimental strategy is to prepare two separate mulls, one in Nujol and one in Fluorolube, and combine their transparent regions to yield a complete, reliable spectrum from $4000$ to $650\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ while avoiding KBr-induced reactions and thermal stress.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1468543"}]}
