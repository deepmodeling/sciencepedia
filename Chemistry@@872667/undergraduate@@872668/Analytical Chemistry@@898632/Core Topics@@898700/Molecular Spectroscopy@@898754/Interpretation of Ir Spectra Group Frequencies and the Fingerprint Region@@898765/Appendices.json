In particular, the carbonyl stretch is a strong, diagnostic band whose position is sensitive to functional group type and conjugation, and coupling between adjacent carbonyls can split the band into two distinct absorptions corresponding to symmetric and asymmetric stretching modes.\n\n1) The spectrum exhibits two very strong, sharp peaks in the carbonyl region at $1810\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ and $1760\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$. A pair of strong C=O absorptions in this high-frequency region is the hallmark of an acid anhydride. In an anhydride, two adjacent carbonyl groups are coupled; their symmetric and asymmetric C=O stretching modes appear as two distinct strong bands typically near $1820\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ and $1760\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$. This directly points to an anhydride functionality.\n\n2) The presence of medium-to-strong absorptions between $2850\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ and $2980\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ is consistent with aliphatic $\\text{sp}^{3}$ C–H stretching, which is expected for common aliphatic derivatives of all candidates.

Alcohol O–H stretches appear as broader bands centered higher (typically around 3200 to 3600 cm^{-1}) and do not usually extend strongly down to 2500 cm^{-1}.\n- A strong, sharp absorption at 1710 cm^{-1} is consistent with a saturated aliphatic carboxylic acid C=O stretch. Esters typically absorb higher (about 1735 to 1750 cm^{-1}), and simple aliphatic ketones are near 1715 cm^{-1} but would not be accompanied by the very broad acid O–H band observed here.\n- The absence of absorption in 1620 to 1680 cm^{-1} indicates no C=C stretch (no alkene).\n- All C–H stretches below 3000 cm^{-1} indicate only sp^{3} C–H bonds (no sp^{2} C–H).\n\nNext, use the molecular formula to assess the degree of unsaturation. The index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) is\n$$\n\\text{IHD}=\\frac{2C+2+N-H-X}{2}.\n$$\nFor $C_{6}H_{10}O_{2}$ with $N=0$ and $X=0$,\n$$\n\\text{IHD}=\\frac{2\\cdot 6+2-10}{2}=\\frac{14-10}{2}=2.\n$$\nA carboxylic acid accounts for one unit (the C=O double bond). The remaining one unit must be due to either a ring or another double bond. The IR data exclude a C=C double bond, so the second unit is most plausibly a ring. Therefore, the structure should be a cycloalkane bearing a carboxylic acid.\n\nNow evaluate the options:\n- A (Hex-4-enoic acid): Contains a C=C. This should show a C=C stretch near 1640 to 1680 cm^{-1} and =C–H stretches above 3000 cm^{-1}, both of which are absent. Eliminated.\n- B (Methyl 4-pentenoate): An ester (C=O around 1735 to 1750 cm^{-1}) and an alkene; also lacks the carboxylic acid O–H band. Eliminated.\n- C (Adipic acid): Molecular formula would be $C_{6}H_{10}O_{4}$, not $C_{6}H_{10}O_{2}$. Eliminated.\n- D (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid): Matches the formula $C_{6}H_{10}O_{2}$, contains a carboxylic acid (broad 2500 to 3300 cm^{-1}, C=O near 1710 cm^{-1}), has no alkene, and only sp^{3} C–H stretches below 3000 cm^{-1}. Consistent.\n- E (4-Hydroxycyclohexanone): Would show an alcohol O–H around 3200 to 3600 cm^{-1} (not the very broad carboxylic acid band down to 2500 cm^{-1}) and a ketone C=O; does not fit the observed acid O–H feature.
