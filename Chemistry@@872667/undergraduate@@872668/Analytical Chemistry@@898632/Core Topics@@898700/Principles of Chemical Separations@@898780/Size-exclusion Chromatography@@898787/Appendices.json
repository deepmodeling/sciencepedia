Conversely, smaller proteins can enter the pores, increasing their path length and causing them to elute later (at a higher elution volume).\n\nFor a given column, there is a linear relationship between the elution volume ($V_e$) and the base-10 logarithm of the molecular weight (MW) of a protein over a specific range.

In chromatography, choosing the correct stationary phase is critical for a successful separation. This problem challenges you to think like a biochemist, selecting the optimal SEC resin to purify a specific protein from a mixture by considering the resin's fractionation range and the sizes of the molecules involved. [@problem_id:2138049]", "problem": "A biochemistry student is tasked with purifying a recombinant fluorescent protein, which we will call \"GlowBlue,\" from a bacterial cell lysate. The monomeric form of GlowBlue has a molecular weight of 28 kilodaltons (kDa). However, during the expression and lysis process, a significant portion of GlowBlue forms large, non-functional soluble aggregates with an average molecular weight of approximately 350 kDa. The student decides to use Size-Exclusion Chromatography (SEC), also known as gel filtration, to separate the desired monomeric GlowBlue from the large aggregates.\n\nIn SEC, a column is packed with porous beads (a resin). Molecules larger than the largest pores in the beads are \"excluded\" and pass quickly through the column, eluting first in a volume known as the void volume. Molecules smaller than the pores can enter them, are \"included,\" and thus take a longer, slower path, eluting later. A resin's \"fractionation range\" defines the range of molecular weights it can effectively separate.\n\nThe student has two different SEC resins available in the lab:\n- **Resin X:** Has a fractionation range of 10 kDa to 150 kDa.\n- **Resin Y:** Has a fractionation range of 100 kDa to 600 kDa.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly identifies the optimal resin for this purification task and provides the correct reasoning?\n\nA. Resin Y should be chosen, because the 28 kDa monomer will be excluded and elute first, while the 350 kDa aggregate will be included and elute later, allowing for their separation.\n\nB.

Resin X should be chosen, because the 28 kDa monomer will be fully included and elute last, while the 350 kDa aggregate is too large to enter the column at all.\n\nE. Both resins are equally suitable, as they will both separate the smaller monomer from the larger aggregate.", "solution": "Define the molecular masses and resin properties symbolically. Let the monomer mass be $M_{m}=28$ kDa and the aggregate mass be $M_{a}=350$ kDa. Let Resin X have fractionation range $[M_{\\min}^{X},M_{\\max}^{X}]=[10,150]$ kDa and Resin Y have fractionation range $[M_{\\min}^{Y},M_{\\max}^{Y}]=[100,600]$ kDa. Let $V_{0}$ denote the void volume and $V_{t}$ the total permeation volume.\n\nState the governing SEC principles explicitly:\n1. If $MM_{\\max}$ for a given resin, the species is excluded from the pores and elutes at $V_{0}$ (earliest), with minimal dispersion.\n2. If $M_{\\min}\\leq M\\leq M_{\\max}$, the species is partially included and elutes between $V_{0}$ and $V_{t}$, with retention increasing as $M$ decreases within the range; this is the regime of effective size-based separation.\n3. If $MM_{\\min}$, the species is essentially fully included and elutes near $V_{t}$ (latest), and small species in this regime are poorly resolved from each other.\n\nApply these rules to Resin X. For Resin X, $M_{a}=350$ kDa satisfies $M_{a}M_{\\max}^{X}=150$ kDa, so the aggregate is excluded and elutes at $V_{0}$. The monomer has $M_{m}=28$ kDa, which satisfies $M_{\\min}^{X}=10\\ \\text{kDa}\\leq M_{m}\\leq M_{\\max}^{X}=150\\ \\text{kDa}$, so it is partially included and elutes later than $V_{0}$. Therefore, with Resin X, the aggregate elutes first in the void volume and the monomer elutes later with resolvable retardation, enabling effective separation. This reasoning matches statement B.\n\nApply these rules to Resin Y. For Resin Y, $M_{a}=350$ kDa satisfies $M_{\\min}^{Y}=100\\ \\text{kDa}\\leq M_{a}\\leq M_{\\max}^{Y}=600\\ \\text{kDa}$, so the aggregate is partially included and does not elute at $V_{0}$. The monomer has $M_{m}=28$ kDa, which satisfies $M_{m}M_{\\min}^{Y}=100$ kDa, so it is fully included and elutes near $V_{t}$. Hence, statement A is incorrect because the $28$ kDa monomer would not be excluded on Resin Y; it would elute last, not first. Statement C is incorrect because $M_{m}=28$ kDa is not within Resin Y’s fractionation range. Statement D incorrectly claims the $28$ kDa monomer would be fully included on Resin X; in fact, $28$ kDa lies within Resin X’s fractionation range and is only partially included, though the conclusion about the aggregate being too large to enter the pores is correct. Statement E is incorrect because Resin X provides the optimal, classic scenario where the undesired large aggregate elutes in the void volume cleanly separated from the desired monomer, whereas Resin Y would place the desired monomer in the fully included regime with poorer resolution and different elution order.\n\nTherefore, the optimal resin is Resin X, with correct reasoning captured by statement B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2138049"}]}
