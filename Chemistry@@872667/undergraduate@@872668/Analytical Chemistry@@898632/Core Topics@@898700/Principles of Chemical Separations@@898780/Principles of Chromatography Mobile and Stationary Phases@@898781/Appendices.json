The stationary phase is a standard silica gel plate, which is highly polar due to the presence of surface silanol ($\\text{Si-OH}$) groups. The initial mobile phase (eluent) chosen is pure hexane, a non-polar solvent.\n\nThe chemist spots a solution containing a newly synthesized, moderately polar organic compound onto the baseline of the TLC plate and develops it in a chamber saturated with hexane vapor. After the solvent front has moved near the top of the plate, the plate is removed and visualized. The spot corresponding to the target compound is observed to have barely moved from the original spotting line, yielding a very low retention factor ($R_f$) of approximately 0.05.\n\nThe goal is to modify the mobile phase to increase the compound's $R_f$ value into a more useful analytical range (e.g., 0.3 to 0.6). The chemist has access to a variety of solvents. A partial eluotropic series, which ranks common solvents by their eluting power on a polar stationary phase like silica, is provided below in order of increasing polarity and eluting strength:\n\nHexane  Toluene  Dichloromethane  Ethyl Acetate  Acetone  Methanol\n\nBased on these observations and the fundamental principles of chromatography, which of the following actions represents the most logical and effective modification to the mobile phase to achieve the desired increase in the $R_f$ value?\n\nA.

Keep the mobile phase as pure hexane but double the development time in the TLC chamber.", "solution": "The problem requires us to determine the best strategy to increase the retention factor ($R_f$) of a moderately polar compound on a polar silica gel stationary phase, given that a non-polar mobile phase (hexane) resulted in an $R_f$ value near zero.\n\nFirst, let's understand the key principles. The retention factor, $R_f$, is defined as the ratio of the distance traveled by the compound to the distance traveled by the solvent front:\n$$R_f = \\frac{\\text{distance traveled by compound}}{\\text{distance traveled by solvent front}}$$\nAn $R_f$ value of approximately 0.05 indicates that the compound has very little mobility on the plate.\n\nThe separation in normal-phase chromatography, such as TLC with a silica plate, is governed by polarity.\n- **Stationary Phase:** Silica gel is highly polar.\n- **Compound:** The compound is described as moderately polar.\n- **Mobile Phase:** The initial mobile phase, hexane, is non-polar.\n\nThe principle \"like dissolves like\" or, more accurately, \"like adsorbs like\" is key here. The moderately polar compound has a strong affinity for the highly polar silica stationary phase. For the compound to move up the plate (i.e., for its $R_f$ to be greater than 0), it must be displaced from the stationary phase and carried along by the mobile phase.\n\nThe observed low $R_f$ value means that the compound is adsorbed very strongly to the silica and the non-polar hexane mobile phase is not polar enough to compete for the compound and elute it up the plate. The equilibrium of the compound is heavily shifted towards being adsorbed on the stationary phase rather than being dissolved in the mobile phase.\n\nTo increase the $R_f$ value, we need to shift this equilibrium. The compound must spend a larger fraction of its time in the mobile phase. This can be achieved by increasing the polarity of the mobile phase. A more polar mobile phase will be more effective at attracting the moderately polar compound away from the stationary phase and carrying it up the plate.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n**A. Switch the mobile phase to pure toluene.**\nAccording to the provided eluotropic series, toluene is more polar than hexane. Switching to pure toluene would increase the eluting power of the mobile phase, which would increase the $R_f$ of the compound. This is a plausible step in the right direction.\n\n**B. Switch the mobile phase to a 90:10 (v/v) mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate.**\nEthyl acetate is significantly more polar than both hexane and toluene. By creating a mixture of 90% hexane and 10% ethyl acetate, we are creating a mobile phase with a polarity that is substantially higher than pure hexane. Adding a small amount of a polar \"modifier\" solvent to a non-polar bulk solvent is a standard, effective, and highly tunable method for optimizing TLC separations. This will significantly increase the eluting power and is very likely to bring the $R_f$ into the desired range. Comparing with option A, this method offers a more substantial and controlled increase in polarity.\n\n**C. Switch the mobile phase to pure methanol.**\nMethanol is at the high end of the polarity scale in the given series. Switching to pure methanol would create a very polar mobile phase. This mobile phase would be so effective at eluting the moderately polar compound that the compound would likely have very little affinity for the stationary phase. As a result, the compound would travel with or very close to the solvent front, resulting in an $R_f$ value close to 1.0. This is an over-correction and would not lead to good separation if other compounds were present.\n\n**D. Keep hexane as the mobile phase but add 1% (v/v) of a basic amine, like triethylamine, to it.**\nAdding a basic modifier like triethylamine is a specific technique used when separating basic compounds (e.g., amines). Basic compounds can interact very strongly with the acidic silanol groups on the silica surface, leading to poor spot shape (tailing) or irreversible adsorption. While adding a base can improve the chromatography of basic compounds, the problem only states the compound is \"moderately polar,\" not that it is basic. The primary issue identified is a general lack of eluting power, not a specific acid-base interaction. Therefore, this is not the most logical general-purpose approach.\n\n**E. Keep the mobile phase as pure hexane but double the development time in the TLC chamber.**\nThe $R_f$ value is a ratio of distances. If the development time is increased, both the solvent front and the compound spot will travel further up the plate. However, their ratio, $R_f$, will remain approximately constant. This action will not solve the fundamental problem of the compound being too strongly adsorbed to the stationary phase.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth A and B would increase the $R_f$ value. However, option B represents a more standard and powerful method for adjusting polarity. Using a binary solvent system allows for fine-tuning of the mobile phase polarity by simply adjusting the ratio of the two solvents. Adding 10% ethyl acetate to hexane will provide a significant boost in eluting power, making it a more effective and logical next step than just moving to the next solvent in the series (toluene). Therefore, option B is the best choice.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1462154"}, {"introduction": "Truly mastering chromatography means looking beyond primary retention mechanisms and learning to control subtle secondary interactions.

The column's hydrogen-bond donor character may further enhance retention of propanoic acid (via its carbonyl group, a hydrogen-bond acceptor). Therefore, N,N-dimethylaniline elutes before propanoic acid.\n\n- **On Column B (residual silanols, cation-exchange activity):** The cationic N,N-dimethylanilinium will undergo a strong secondary ion-exchange interaction with the negatively charged residual silanol sites. This strong attraction significantly increases its retention time. The neutral propanoic acid does not experience this interaction. Therefore, propanoic acid elutes before N,N-dimethylaniline.\n\nCombining these results: on Column A, N,N-dimethylaniline elutes before propanoic acid; on Column B, propanoic acid elutes before N,N-dimethylaniline.
