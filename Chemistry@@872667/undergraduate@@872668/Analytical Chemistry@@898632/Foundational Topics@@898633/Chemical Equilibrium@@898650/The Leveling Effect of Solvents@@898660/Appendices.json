While we learn that acids like $HCl$ and $HBr$ are \"strong,\" their intrinsic strengths are not identical. This exercise challenges you to select a solvent that can reveal this difference, moving beyond the leveling environment of water to a place where their true acidities can be compared. [@problem_id:2211722]", "problem": "A chemist is tasked with experimentally ranking the acid strengths of hydrochloric acid ($HCl$) and hydrobromic acid ($HBr$). In a typical aqueous solution, both acids dissociate completely, a phenomenon known as the leveling effect, which prevents a direct comparison of their intrinsic strengths. To overcome this, the chemist must select a solvent that can differentiate between them. The two available solvents are deionized water and anhydrous formic acid ($HCOOH$).\n\nYou are provided with the following pKa values, which quantify the acidity of various species. A lower pKa value indicates a stronger acid.\n*   pKa of $HCl \\approx -6.3$\n*   pKa of $HBr \\approx -8.7$\n*   The pKa of the hydronium ion ($H_3O^+$), the conjugate acid of water, is approximately $0$.\n*   The pKa of the protonated formic acid cation ($HCOOH_2^+$), the conjugate acid of formic acid, is approximately $-6.0$.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following statements correctly identifies the appropriate solvent and the fundamental reason for its suitability?\n\nA. Water should be used, because its conjugate acid, $H_3O^+$, has a pKa of 0, which is higher than the pKa values of both $HCl$ and $HBr$, allowing it to act as a universal solvent.\n\nB. Formic acid should be used, because as a stronger acid itself (pKa of $HCOOH$ is 3.75, much lower than water's pKa of 15.7), it is less likely to be protonated.\n\nC. Water should be used, because it is a weaker base than the conjugate bases ($Cl^-$ and $Br^-$) of the two acids, which facilitates the proton transfer needed for measurement.\n\nD. Formic acid should be used, because the pKa of its conjugate acid ($HCOOH_2^+$, pKa ≈ -6.0) is close to the pKa of the acids being studied, which prevents complete dissociation and allows for an equilibrium to be established for each.\n\nE. Either solvent is equally suitable, as the intrinsic acidity is independent of the solvent environment.", "solution": "Goal: pick a solvent that prevents the leveling effect so that $HCl$ and $HBr$ do not both fully convert to the same solvated proton and thus can be ranked by their established equilibria.\n\nPrinciple: In a protic solvent $S$, acids react by the proton-transfer equilibrium\n$$\nHA + S \\rightleftharpoons A^{-} + SH^{+}.\n$$\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is related to $pK_{a}$ values in that medium by\n$$\n\\log_{10} K_{\\mathrm{PT}} = pK_{a}(SH^{+}) - pK_{a}(HA),\n$$\nhence\n$$\nK_{\\mathrm{PT}} = 10^{\\,pK_{a}(SH^{+}) - pK_{a}(HA)}.\n$$\nIf $pK_{a}(SH^{+}) \\gg pK_{a}(HA)$ (numerically greater), then $K_{\\mathrm{PT}} \\gg 1$, and $HA$ is leveled to $SH^{+}$ (complete proton transfer). If $pK_{a}(SH^{+})$ is close to $pK_{a}(HA)$, $K_{\\mathrm{PT}}$ is finite and an equilibrium is established that can distinguish acids by differing extents of reaction.\n\nApply to water as solvent: here $S = H_{2}O$ and $SH^{+} = H_{3}O^{+}$ with $pK_{a}(H_{3}O^{+}) \\approx 0$. For $HCl$ with $pK_{a}(HCl) \\approx -6.3$,\n$$\n\\log_{10} K_{\\mathrm{PT}} = 0 - (-6.3) = 6.3 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; K_{\\mathrm{PT}} \\approx 10^{6.3} \\gg 1,\n$$\nand for $HBr$ with $pK_{a}(HBr) \\approx -8.7$,\n$$\n\\log_{10} K_{\\mathrm{PT}} = 0 - (-8.7) = 8.7 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; K_{\\mathrm{PT}} \\approx 10^{8.7} \\gg 1.\n$$\nBoth reactions go essentially to completion, producing $H_{3}O^{+}$. This is the leveling effect; $HCl$ and $HBr$ appear equally strong in water, so water cannot differentiate them. Thus options A and C are incorrect: the fact that $pK_{a}(H_{3}O^{+})$ is much higher than those of $HCl$ and $HBr$ is precisely why water levels them, and the relative basicities of $H_{2}O$ versus $Cl^{-}$ or $Br^{-}$ do not provide a way to distinguish intrinsic acid strengths here.\n\nApply to formic acid as solvent: here $S = HCOOH$ and $SH^{+} = HCOOH_{2}^{+}$ with $pK_{a}(HCOOH_{2}^{+}) \\approx -6.0$. For $HCl$,\n$$\n\\log_{10} K_{\\mathrm{PT}} = (-6.0) - (-6.3) = 0.3 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; K_{\\mathrm{PT}} \\approx 10^{0.3},\n$$\nwhich is only modestly greater than $1$, so an observable equilibrium is established. For $HBr$,\n$$\n\\log_{10} K_{\\mathrm{PT}} = (-6.0) - (-8.7) = 2.7 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; K_{\\mathrm{PT}} \\approx 10^{2.7},\n$$\nwhich is much larger, but still finite in this medium. The two acids therefore produce measurably different extents of proton transfer to $HCOOH$, allowing their strengths to be ranked. This directly supports the statement that a solvent whose conjugate acid has $pK_{a}$ close to the acids under study avoids complete leveling and permits differentiation.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is that formic acid should be used because the $pK_{a}$ of its conjugate acid is close to those of $HCl$ and $HBr$, preventing complete dissociation and allowing distinct equilibria. Option B is incorrect because the intrinsic acidity of the solvent itself (e.g., $pK_{a}$ of $HCOOH$ versus water) is not the criterion; what matters is $pK_{a}$ of the conjugate acid of the solvent, which sets the leveling limit. Option E is incorrect because observed acidity depends on the solvent environment.\n\nHence the correct answer is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2211722"}, {"introduction": "The leveling effect is not limited to acids; it equally applies to bases in a sufficiently acidic solvent. In this problem, we will see how an acidic solvent like formic acid can make two bases of different intrinsic strengths appear indistinguishable.

This indicates that in water, methylamine is a significantly stronger base than ammonia.\n\nNow, consider a different scenario where both methylamine and ammonia are dissolved in anhydrous (water-free) formic acid ($HCOOH$), which is a much stronger acidic solvent than water.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the observable basic behavior of methylamine and ammonia in anhydrous formic acid?\n\nA.

The base dissociation reaction for a generic base B in water is:\n$B + H_2O \\rightleftharpoons BH^+ + OH^-$\nThe base dissociation constant is $K_b = \\frac{[BH^+][OH^-]}{[B]}$. A larger $K_b$ value signifies a stronger base.\nFor methylamine: $K_b(CH_3NH_2) = 4.4 \\times 10^{-4}$\nFor ammonia: $K_b(NH_3) = 1.8 \\times 10^{-5}$\nSince $K_b(CH_3NH_2) > K_b(NH_3)$, methylamine is indeed a stronger base than ammonia in water. This is due to the electron-donating inductive effect of the methyl group, which increases the electron density on the nitrogen atom, making it more available to accept a proton.\n\n**Step 2: Introduce the Concept of the Leveling Effect**\nThe apparent strength of an acid or a base depends heavily on the solvent in which it is dissolved. The \"leveling effect\" describes how a solvent can make different acids or bases appear to have similar strengths.\n- A strongly basic solvent will \"level\" the strength of strong acids. For example, in liquid ammonia, both $HCl$ and $HBr$ would be completely deprotonated and appear equally strong.\n- A strongly acidic solvent will \"level\" the strength of strong bases. Any base stronger than the conjugate base of the solvent will be completely protonated by the solvent. The apparent strength of all such bases is then limited by the solvent's ability to donate a proton and is effectively \"leveled\" to the strength of the solvent's conjugate base.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Leveling Effect to the Given Scenario**\nThe solvent in this problem is anhydrous formic acid ($HCOOH$). Formic acid is a protic, acidic solvent. It is a much stronger acid than water. Both methylamine and ammonia are bases. When dissolved in formic acid, they will react with the solvent by accepting a proton.\n\nThe reactions are:\n1. Methylamine in formic acid: $CH_3NH_2 + HCOOH \\rightarrow CH_3NH_3^+ + HCOO^-$\n2. Ammonia in formic acid: $NH_3 + HCOOH \\rightarrow NH_4^+ + HCOO^-$\n\nBecause formic acid is a very strong acid relative to the conjugate acids of methylamine ($CH_3NH_3^+$) and ammonia ($NH_4^+$), it will readily and completely donate its proton to both bases. Both reactions will proceed essentially to completion (the equilibrium lies far to the right).\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nSince both methylamine and ammonia are fully protonated by the formic acid solvent, they both react completely. In this solvent system, the strongest available base is the conjugate base of the solvent, the formate ion ($HCOO^-$). We can no longer distinguish the inherent difference in basicity between methylamine and ammonia because the solvent is so acidic that it protonates both of them quantitatively. Their basic strengths are \"leveled\" by the solvent. Therefore, they will appear to have equal basic strength in anhydrous formic acid.\n\nThis makes option C the correct choice.\n- Option A is incorrect because it reflects the behavior in water, ignoring the leveling effect of the acidic solvent.\n- Option B is incorrect.\n- Option D is incorrect because both are strong enough bases to react with the acidic solvent.\n- Option E is incorrect because while they are both protonated, the leveling effect makes their strengths appear equal, not inverted.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1482234"}, {"introduction": "So far, we have seen how solvents can \"level\" the strengths of acids and bases.
