The standard contains two co-eluting structural isomers: Ethylbenzene (EB) and p-Xylene (pX). Due to their similar chemical properties, they are not separated by the gas chromatograph, resulting in a single, unresolved chromatographic peak. An investigation is launched to compare two different data processing strategies.\n\n**Method A (Standard Workflow):** A junior analyst uses the instrument's default software, which integrates the total ion current of the unresolved peak and extracts an averaged mass spectrum across this entire time window. Based on a spectral library match, the software misidentifies the entire content of the peak as p-Xylene. The mass of p-Xylene reported by this method is denoted as $m_{A}$.\n\n**Method B (Advanced Workflow):** A senior chemist, suspecting co-elution, re-processes the raw data file using a Multivariate Curve Resolution - Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS) algorithm. This chemometric technique mathematically deconvolutes the overlapping signals, successfully resolving the pure mass spectrum and pure elution profile for each of the two isomers.
