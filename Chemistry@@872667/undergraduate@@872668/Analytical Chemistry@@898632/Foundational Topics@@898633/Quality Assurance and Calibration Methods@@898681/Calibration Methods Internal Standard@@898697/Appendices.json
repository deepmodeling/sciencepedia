The chosen internal standard is a deuterated form of the analyte, Bisphenol A-d16 (BPA-d16), which is chemically similar to BPA but distinguishable by the mass spectrometer.\n\nA calibration curve was first established. A series of standard solutions were prepared, each containing a constant concentration of BPA-d16, but with varying known concentrations of BPA. Analysis of these standards produced a linear relationship between the analyte concentration and the instrumental response. The resulting calibration curve is accurately described by the equation:\n\n$$R = m \\cdot C_{BPA}$$\n\nHere, $R$ is the measured dimensionless ratio of the instrument signal for BPA to the instrument signal for BPA-d16, $C_{BPA}$ is the concentration of BPA in the standard solution, and the slope, $m$, was determined to be $0.452$ L/mg.\n\nFollowing the same procedure, an aliquot of the collected river water sample was fortified with the BPA-d16 internal standard to the exact same concentration used for the calibration standards.
