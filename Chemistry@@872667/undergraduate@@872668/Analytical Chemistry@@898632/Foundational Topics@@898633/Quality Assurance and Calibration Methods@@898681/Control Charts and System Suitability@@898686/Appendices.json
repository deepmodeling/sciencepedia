Then, we will classify each measurement into its corresponding zone and check the sequence of measurements against the given Western Electric Rules to find the first violation.\n\n**Step 1: Define the Control Chart Boundaries**\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Mean potential, $\\mu = 245.5$ mV\n- Standard deviation, $\\sigma = 0.6$ mV\n\nWe calculate the boundaries for $\\pm 1\\sigma$, $\\pm 2\\sigma$, and $\\pm 3\\sigma$ from the mean.\n\n- Centerline (CL): $\\mu = 245.5$ mV\n- $1\\sigma$ limits: $\\mu \\pm 1\\sigma = 245.5 \\pm 0.6 = [244.9, 246.1]$ mV\n- $2\\sigma$ limits: $\\mu \\pm 2\\sigma = 245.5 \\pm 2(0.6) = 245.5 \\pm 1.2 = [244.3, 246.7]$ mV\n- $3\\sigma$ limits (UCL/LCL): $\\mu \\pm 3\\sigma = 245.5 \\pm 3(0.6) = 245.5 \\pm 1.8 = [243.7, 247.3]$ mV\n\n**Step 2: Define the Zones**\n\nBased on these boundaries, we can define the specific ranges for each zone on both sides of the centerline:\n\n- **Upper Zones (above the centerline of 245.5 mV):**\n    - Upper Zone C: $(245.5, 246.1]$ mV\n    - Upper Zone B: $(246.1, 246.7]$ mV\n    - Upper Zone A: $(246.7, 247.3]$ mV\n\n- **Lower Zones (below the centerline of 245.5 mV):**\n    - Lower Zone C: $[244.9, 245.5)$ mV\n    - Lower Zone B: $[244.3, 244.9)$ mV\n    - Lower Zone A: $[243.7, 244.3)$ mV\n\n**Step 3: Classify Each Measurement**\n\nNow, we analyze the sequence of five daily measurements and determine which zone each point falls into.\n\n- **Day 1: 245.9 mV**\n  This value is greater than 245.5 mV and less than or equal to 246.1 mV. So, it falls in **Upper Zone C**.\n\n- **Day 2: 246.9 mV**\n  This value is greater than 246.7 mV and less than or equal to 247.3 mV. So, it falls in **Upper Zone A**.\n\n- **Day 3: 246.5 mV**\n  This value is greater than 246.1 mV and less than or equal to 246.7 mV. So, it falls in **Upper Zone B**.\n\n- **Day 4: 247.1 mV**\n  This value is greater than 246.7 mV and less than or equal to 247.3 mV. So, it falls in **Upper Zone A**.\n\n- **Day 5: 245.2 mV**\n  This value is greater than or equal to 244.9 mV and less than 245.5 mV. So, it falls in **Lower Zone C**.\n\nThe sequence of zones for the five points is: (Upper C, Upper A, Upper B, Upper A, Lower C).\n\n**Step 4: Check for Violations of Western Electric Rules**\n\nWe check the rules in the order they might be triggered by the accumulating data.\n\n- **Rule A: One point falls outside the $\\pm 3\\sigma$ limits.**\n  The $\\pm 3\\sigma$ limits are [243.7, 247.3] mV. All five measurements (245.9, 246.9, 246.5, 247.1, 245.2) fall within this range. Therefore, Rule A is not violated.\n\n- **Rule D: Nine consecutive points fall on the same side of the centerline.**\n  We only have a sequence of five points, so this rule cannot be evaluated or violated.\n\n- **Rule B: Two out of three consecutive points fall in Zone A or beyond, on the same side of the centerline.**\n  We examine sets of three consecutive points:\n    - **Points (1, 2, 3):** Zones are (Upper C, Upper A, Upper B). Only one point (Point 2) is in Zone A. No violation here.\n    - **Points (2, 3, 4):** Zones are (Upper A, Upper B, Upper A). Two points (Point 2 and Point 4) are in Zone A. Both are on the upper side of the centerline. This constitutes a violation of Rule B. The violation is triggered upon recording the 4th measurement.\n\nSince we have found a violation, we can stop here. Rule B is violated at the 4th point.\n\n- **Rule C: Four out of five consecutive points fall in Zone B or beyond, on the same side of the centerline.**\n  We check the full set of five points: (Upper C, Upper A, Upper B, Upper A, Lower C).\n  Points in Zone B or beyond are Point 2 (Upper A), Point 3 (Upper B), and Point 4 (Upper A). Point 1 is in C and Point 5 is in a different zone on the other side. There are only three points in Zone B or beyond on the same side (the upper side), not four. Therefore, Rule C is not violated.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe first rule to be violated is Rule B: \"Two out of three consecutive points fall in Zone A or beyond, on the same side of the centerline\".
