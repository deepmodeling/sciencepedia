The substance is solid potassium permanganate, $\\mathrm{KMnO_4}$, classified as a strong oxidizer and corrosive, with stated incompatibilities: flammable materials, organic compounds, reducing agents, and strong acids. Therefore, it requires segregation from flammables/organics, reducing agents, and acids.\n\nStep 2: Translate these hazards into storage requirements. General chemical hygiene practice dictates that strong oxidizers must be stored in a dedicated oxidizers section, segregated from flammable/combustible materials, organic substances, reducing agents, and acids. Corrosivity does not override the primary segregation requirement for oxidizers; the oxidizer designation dominates the storage decision.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate each cabinet against these requirements.\n- Cabinet A (Flammables): Explicitly reserved for flammables and must be kept separate from oxidizers. Placing an oxidizer here violates both the SDS and cabinet rule. Reject A.\n- Cabinet B (Acids): The SDS lists strong acids as an incompatibility. Co-locating $\\mathrm{KMnO_4}$ with acids is unsafe. Reject B.\n- Cabinet C (Bases): Although bases are not listed among the explicit incompatibilities, this cabinet is designated for corrosive bases, not oxidizers, and oxidizers require their own segregated storage. Standard guidance avoids storing strong oxidizers with other corrosives unless the cabinet is also designated for oxidizers. Reject C.\n- Cabinet D (Oxidizers): Specifically designated for oxidizing agents and requires separation from flammables/combustibles, organics, and reducing agents, matching the SDS requirements.

This practice moves beyond simple waste segregation and asks you to devise a safe, multi-step chemical treatment protocol for a mixed waste containing an oxidizer, an acid, and an organic solvent. Successfully determining the correct sequence of neutralization reactions [@problem_id:1480135] demonstrates an advanced understanding of chemical reactivity and the importance of rendering waste less hazardous at the point of generation.", "problem": "In an analytical chemistry laboratory, a student is tasked with cleaning up a waste container left from a series of redox titrations. The 1 L glass bottle is labeled \"Titration Waste\" and contains approximately 300 mL of a homogenous liquid mixture. According to the lab notebook, the waste consists of residual aqueous potassium permanganate ($\\mathrm{KMnO_4}$), unreacted dilute sulfuric acid ($\\mathrm{H_2SO_4}$) used to acidify the titration medium, and acetone ($\\mathrm{CH_3COCH_3}$) from rinsing glassware. The university's Chemical Hygiene Plan (CHP) requires that, whenever feasible, hazardous waste be chemically treated at the point of generation to render it less hazardous before collection.\n\nBased on established principles of chemical safety and reactivity, which of the following procedures describes the correct and safest method for an in-lab treatment of this specific mixed waste stream prior to disposal?\n\nA. Pour the waste into the designated organic waste container, as the primary hazard is the flammable acetone. The permanganate and acid are dilute enough to be compatible with the other contents of the organic waste.\n\nB. First, slowly add solid sodium bicarbonate ($\\mathrm{NaHCO_3}$) to the waste mixture with stirring inside a fume hood until effervescence ceases, in order to neutralize the sulfuric acid. Then, add a solution of sodium bisulfite ($\\mathrm{NaHSO_3}$) to the neutralized mixture until the purple color disappears. Finally, dispose of the resulting solution in the aqueous waste container.\n\nC. Transfer the waste bottle to a fume hood. While stirring, slowly add an aqueous solution of a suitable reducing agent, such as sodium bisulfite ($\\mathrm{NaHSO_3}$), until the purple color of the permanganate is completely discharged. After the color is gone, slowly add solid sodium bicarbonate ($\\mathrm{NaHCO_3}$) until effervescence ceases. Finally, dispose of the resulting near-neutral solution in the designated aqueous waste container.\n\nD. Place the tightly sealed waste container into a secondary containment tray. Affix a \"Hazardous Waste\" label, clearly listing all components and their approximate concentrations, and move it to the satellite accumulation area for pickup by the Environmental Health and Safety department.\n\nE. First, neutralize the mixture by slowly adding concentrated sodium hydroxide ($\\mathrm{NaOH}$) solution until the pH is approximately 7. Then, pour the neutralized mixture into the sink with a large volume of running water.", "solution": "The waste contains three hazards: a strong oxidizer (aqueous $\\mathrm{KMnO_4}$), a strong acid (dilute $\\mathrm{H_2SO_4}$), and a flammable organic solvent (acetone, $\\mathrm{CH_3COCH_3}$). Established safety principles dictate that incompatible mixtures of oxidizers and organics should not be bulked with organic waste and that, when feasible, hazards should be chemically abated at the source under controlled conditions. The correct chemical abatement strategy is to first remove the oxidizer hazard under conditions that keep manganese soluble and avoid formation of reactive solid residues, and only then neutralize residual acidity.\n\nFrom redox chemistry, permanganate is a strong oxidizer in acidic media (large positive standard reduction potential for $\\mathrm{MnO_4^-} \\to \\mathrm{Mn^{2+}}$). A selective reducing agent such as bisulfite reduces permanganate rapidly and cleanly in acidic solution to soluble $\\mathrm{Mn^{2+}}$ while being oxidized to sulfate. The relevant half-reactions in acidic solution are\n$$\n\\mathrm{MnO_4^-} + 8 \\mathrm{H^+} + 5 e^{-} \\to \\mathrm{Mn^{2+}} + 4 \\mathrm{H_2O},\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{HSO_3^-} + \\mathrm{H_2O} \\to \\mathrm{SO_4^{2-}} + 3 \\mathrm{H^+} + 2 e^{-}.\n$$\nBalancing electrons by multiplying the permanganate reduction by $2$ and the bisulfite oxidation by $5$ and then summing yields the net ionic equation\n$$\n2 \\mathrm{MnO_4^-} + 5 \\mathrm{HSO_3^-} + \\mathrm{H^+} \\to 2 \\mathrm{Mn^{2+}} + 5 \\mathrm{SO_4^{2-}} + 3 \\mathrm{H_2O}.\n$$\nThis step consumes acidity and destroys the oxidizer, indicated by discharge of the purple color. Performing this reduction while the medium is still acidic avoids precipitation of $\\mathrm{MnO_2}$ (the neutral/basic reduction product) and prevents leaving a reactive oxidizing solid; it also removes the principal incompatibility between the oxidizer and acetone before any pH adjustment.\n\nAfter the permanganate has been reduced completely (purple color gone), any residual acid should be neutralized carefully. A weak, solid base that releases carbon dioxide, such as sodium bicarbonate, is standard for safe neutralization:\n$$\n\\mathrm{H_2SO_4} + 2 \\mathrm{NaHCO_3} \\to \\mathrm{Na_2SO_4} + 2 \\mathrm{CO_2} \\uparrow + 2 \\mathrm{H_2O}.\n$$\nAdding solid $\\mathrm{NaHCO_3}$ slowly with stirring in a fume hood controls effervescence and heat, and the endpoint is indicated by cessation of bubbling and a near-neutral pH. Only after the oxidizer is quenched and the acid is neutralized should the resulting aqueous salt solution (still containing some acetone) be transferred to the designated aqueous hazardous waste container; it should not be discharged to the sink.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is unsafe and incompatible because it would bulk a strong oxidizer and acid with organic solvent waste, and it ignores feasible hazard abatement.\n- B neutralizes the acid before eliminating the oxidizer, which maintains an active oxidizer in the presence of organic solvent during vigorous $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ evolution and can promote formation of $\\mathrm{MnO_2}$ sludge; this is less safe than quenching the oxidizer first.\n- C correctly reduces permanganate to $\\mathrm{Mn^{2+}}$ in acidic medium using $\\mathrm{NaHSO_3}$, then neutralizes residual acid with $\\mathrm{NaHCO_3}$, and finally collects in aqueous hazardous waste; this matches best practice and the CHP requirement.\n- D does not perform in-lab treatment despite feasibility, contrary to the stated CHP preference.\n- E uses concentrated $\\mathrm{NaOH}$ (introducing a strong base to a mixture with oxidizer and organic) and disposes to the sink, both of which are improper.\n\nTherefore, the correct and safest in-lab treatment is described in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1480135"}, {"introduction": "While many safety guidelines are presented as simple rules, the most robust Chemical Hygiene Plans are ultimately grounded in quantitative risk assessment.
