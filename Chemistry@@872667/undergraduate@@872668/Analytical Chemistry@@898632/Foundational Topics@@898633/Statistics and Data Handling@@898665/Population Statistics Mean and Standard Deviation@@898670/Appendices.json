The probability we want to find this interval for is 68.3%, or 0.683. So we need to solve the following equation for the interval boundaries:\n$$0.683 = \\int_{\\mu - k\\sigma}^{\\mu + k\\sigma} \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x - \\mu)^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right) \\, dx$$\n\nTo simplify this integral, we perform a change of variables. Let's define a new variable, the z-score, as:\n$$z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}$$\nFrom this, we have $x = \\mu + z\\sigma$ and $dx = \\sigma \\, dz$.\n\nWe need to transform the limits of integration.\nWhen $x = \\mu - k\\sigma$, the lower limit becomes $z = \\frac{(\\mu - k\\sigma) - \\mu}{\\sigma} = -k$.\nWhen $x = \\mu + k\\sigma$, the upper limit becomes $z = \\frac{(\\mu + k\\sigma) - \\mu}{\\sigma} = k$.\n\nSubstituting these into the integral:\n$$0.683 = \\int_{-k}^{k} \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z^{2}}{2}\\right) (\\sigma \\, dz)$$\nThe $\\sigma$ terms cancel out, leaving the integral for the standard normal distribution:\n$$0.683 = \\int_{-k}^{k} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z^{2}}{2}\\right) \\, dz$$\n\nThis integral cannot be solved with elementary functions, but its values are well-tabulated. This integral represents the area under the standard normal curve between $z = -k$ and $z = k$.\n\nFor the specific case of the Gaussian distribution, it is a fundamental property that:\n- The interval for $k=1$ (from $z=-1$ to $z=1$) contains approximately 68.3% of the area.\n- The interval for $k=2$ (from $z=-2$ to $z=2$) contains approximately 95.4% of the area.\n- The interval for $k=3$ (from $z=-3$ to $z=3$) contains approximately 99.7% of the area.\n\nThe problem states that we are interested in the range containing 68.3% of the measurements. This corresponds to the case where $k=1$.\n\nWith $k=1$, the limits on the z-score are from -1 to 1. We can convert this back to the original measurement variable, $x$:\nThe lower bound is $x = \\mu + z\\sigma = \\mu + (-1)\\sigma = \\mu - \\sigma$.\nThe upper bound is $x = \\mu + z\\sigma = \\mu + (1)\\sigma = \\mu + \\sigma$.\n\nTherefore, the theoretical range that is expected to contain 68.3% of all individual measurements is $[\\mu - \\sigma, \\mu + \\sigma]$.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA.
