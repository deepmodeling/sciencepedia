The student uses a modern digital analytical balance for the measurement. The manufacturer's specifications for the balance state a readability and tolerance of $\\pm 0.0001$ g.

The observed variability in replicate measurements already reflects the effective impact of resolution and instrumental noise on the measurements.\n\nAdding the manufacturer’s tolerance to $s$ is not correct: when independent random uncertainty sources must be combined, they are combined in quadrature,\n$$\\sigma_{\\text{tot}}=\\sqrt{\\sigma_{1}^{2}+\\sigma_{2}^{2}},$$\nnot by simple summation. Moreover, the replicate-based $s$ already captures the aggregate random effects present.\n\nA disparity between the specification and observed scatter does not imply that the random uncertainty is indeterminable or that a significant systematic error is present; systematic error would manifest as a bias in $\\bar{x}$, not as mere scatter. Finally, the range uses only the two extreme values and is a statistically inefficient and biased estimator of dispersion for small samples, whereas $s$ uses all the data.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate assessment of the random uncertainty associated with a single measurement in this experiment is given by the sample standard deviation computed from the replicate measurements.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1423248"}, {"introduction": "Many important quantities in chemistry, such as reaction rates, are derived from the combination of multiple measurements.

The standard linear error propagation formula, $\\delta f = |f'(x)| \\delta x$, assumes the function $f(x)$ is approximately linear over the interval $x \\pm \\delta x$. However, the function relating pH to $[H^+]$ is $f(pH) = [H^+] = 10^{-pH}$, which is an exponential function and is highly non-linear. Applying the linear approximation over a large input interval like $\\pm 0.80$ pH units would yield an inaccurate and symmetric uncertainty interval for $[H^+]$, which is not appropriate for an exponential relationship.\n\nThe correct and more fundamental method is to determine the range of possible pH values and then calculate the corresponding range for $[H^+]$ by applying the function to the endpoints of the pH interval.\n\nFirst, let's define the minimum and maximum possible pH values based on the measurement and its uncertainty.\nThe central value is $pH_{central} = 4.50$.\nThe uncertainty is $\\delta(pH) = 0.80$.\n\nThe lower bound of the pH interval is:\n$pH_{min} = pH_{central} - \\delta(pH) = 4.50 - 0.80 = 3.70$\n\nThe upper bound of the pH interval is:\n$pH_{max} = pH_{central} + \\delta(pH) = 4.50 + 0.80 = 5.30$\n\nSo, the true pH value is expected to lie within the interval $[3.70, 5.30]$.\n\nNow, we use the relationship $[H^+] = 10^{-pH}$ to find the corresponding interval for the hydronium ion concentration. Note that because of the negative sign in the exponent, the function is monotonically decreasing.
