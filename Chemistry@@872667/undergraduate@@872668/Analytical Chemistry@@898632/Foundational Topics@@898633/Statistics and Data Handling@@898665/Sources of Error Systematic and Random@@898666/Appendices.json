The procedure involves reacting the sample with a reagent to form a intensely colored iron complex, and then measuring its absorbance with a spectrophotometer. The concentration is determined by comparing the sample's absorbance to a calibration curve.\n\nThe calibration curve is generated using a series of standards prepared by diluting a primary stock solution. The stock solution was certified to have an iron concentration of $C_{cert} = 100.0$ milligrams per liter (mg/L). However, due to improper storage, the stock solution has partially degraded over several months. A careful re-analysis reveals that its actual concentration is only $C_{actual} = 96.50$ mg/L.\n\nAn inexperienced technician, unaware of the degradation, proceeds to use this faulty stock solution to create the calibration standards, assuming its concentration is still $C_{cert}$. The technician then uses this incorrect calibration to measure the concentration of an unknown groundwater sample.\n\nAssuming that Beer's law is perfectly obeyed over the concentration range and that the calibration line correctly passes through the origin, calculate the relative error in the final concentration reported by the technician for the unknown sample. The relative error is defined as $\\frac{C_{reported} - C_{true}}{C_{true}}$, where $C_{reported}$ is the concentration determined by the technician and $C_{true}$ is the true concentration of the unknown sample.\n\nExpress your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let the true Beer's law relationship be $A = k C$, where $A$ is absorbance, $C$ is the true concentration, and $k$ is the proportionality constant (product of molar absorptivity and pathlength).\n\nStandards prepared from the degraded stock have actual concentration proportional to the stock’s actual concentration.
