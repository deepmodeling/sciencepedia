The core of the method relies on converting arsenic into a volatile form, arsine gas ($\\text{AsH}_3$), for detection. The key to differentiating between the arsenic species, arsenite $\\text{As(III)}$ and arsenate $\\text{As(V)}$, lies in their different reactivities.\n\nFirst, let's consider the reaction that generates the detected substance, arsine gas. This is achieved by reduction with sodium borohydride ($\\text{NaBH}_4$) in an acidic medium. The crucial point is the kinetics of this reduction for the two different oxidation states of arsenic.\nThe reduction of $\\text{As(III)}$ to $\\text{AsH}_3$ is rapid:\n$$ \\text{As(III)} + \\text{BH}_4^- \\xrightarrow{\\text{fast}} \\text{AsH}_3 $$\nIn contrast, the reduction of $\\text{As(V)}$ to $\\text{AsH}_3$ using $\\text{NaBH}_4$ is kinetically very slow and can be considered negligible during the short time frame of an analytical measurement.\n$$ \\text{As(V)} + \\text{BH}_4^- \\xrightarrow{\\text{very slow}} \\text{AsH}_3 $$\n\nNow, we can analyze the two measurements described.\n\nIn **Measurement B**, the acidified sample is treated directly with $\\text{NaBH}_4$. Because only the reaction with $\\text{As(III)}$ is fast, the amount of $\\text{AsH}_3$ generated and measured corresponds almost exclusively to the amount of $\\text{As(III)}$ originally present in the sample. Thus, Measurement B provides the concentration of arsenite, [As(III)].\n\nIn **Measurement A**, an additional \"pre-reduction\" step is performed before the addition of $\\text{NaBH}_4$. The sample is treated with potassium iodide (KI) and ascorbic acid. The purpose of this step is to convert the kinetically unreactive $\\text{As(V)}$ into the reactive $\\text{As(III)}$ form. The iodide ion ($\\text{I}^-$) from KI acts as the reducing agent in this step:\n$$ \\text{H}_3\\text{AsO}_4 (\\text{As(V)}) + 2\\,\\text{I}^- + 2\\,\\text{H}^+ \\rightleftharpoons \\text{H}_3\\text{AsO}_3 (\\text{As(III)}) + \\text{I}_2 + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} $$\nAscorbic acid is typically added to reduce the iodine ($\\text{I}_2$) produced back to iodide ($\\text{I}^-$), which drives the equilibrium to the right, ensuring a complete and quantitative conversion of $\\text{As(V)}$ to $\\text{As(III)}$. After this pre-reduction step, virtually all arsenic in the sample—both the original $\\text{As(III)}$ and the $\\text{As(III)}$ formed from the reduction of $\\text{As(V)}$—is present in the $\\text{As(III)}$ oxidation state. When $\\text{NaBH}_4$ is subsequently added, all of this $\\text{As(III)}$ is rapidly converted to $\\text{AsH}_3$ and measured. Therefore, the signal from Measurement A corresponds to the total arsenic concentration, [As(total)] = [As(III)] + [As(V)].\n\nThe speciation is completed by subtraction: [As(V)] = [As(total)] - [As(III)].\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this analysis:\n- A is incorrect. The primary role of KI is not to remove interferences by precipitation but to act as a reducing agent for $\\text{As(V)}$.\n- B is incorrect. The KI/ascorbic acid mixture does not generate arsine gas; it reduces $\\text{As(V)}$ to $\\text{As(III)}$. The subsequent addition of $\\text{NaBH}_4$ is what generates the $\\text{AsH}_3$.\n- C is incorrect. KI is a stoichiometric reactant (a reductant), not a catalyst. It is consumed in the reaction of reducing $\\text{As(V)}$.\n- D is correct. This statement accurately describes the entire process: KI/ascorbic acid reduces $\\text{As(V)}$ to $\\text{As(III)}$ so that all arsenic is in the reactive $\\text{As(III)}$ form for total arsenic measurement. Omitting this step allows for the selective measurement of the original $\\text{As(III)}$ due to the kinetic differences in hydride generation.\n- E is incorrect. This statement proposes the opposite reaction (oxidation of $\\text{As(III)}$ to $\\text{As(V)}$) and incorrectly claims $\\text{As(V)}$ gives a stronger signal.
