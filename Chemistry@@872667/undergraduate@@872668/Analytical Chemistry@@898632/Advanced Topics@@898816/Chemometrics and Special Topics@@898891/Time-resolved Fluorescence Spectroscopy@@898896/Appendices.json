In the absence of the protein, the free drug molecule in an aqueous buffer solution exhibits a certain fluorescence quantum yield and fluorescence lifetime. When the drug binds to a specific pocket on the protein, its local chemical environment is altered. Time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy experiments are conducted on both the free and protein-bound drug.\n\nThe experiments reveal two key changes upon binding:\n1. The fluorescence quantum yield of the protein-bound drug is 60% of the quantum yield of the free drug.\n2. The fluorescence lifetime of the protein-bound drug is 1.5 times the lifetime of the free drug.\n\nThe de-excitation of the drug's excited state can occur through two main pathways: radiative decay (fluorescence emission, with rate constant $k_r$) and non-radiative decay (with a combined rate constant $k_{nr}$).

Luminase is a fluorescent protein (the donor), and Quenchidin is a protein that can act as a non-radiative acceptor. The experimental strategy relies on Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), a mechanism where energy is transferred from an excited donor to an acceptor.\n\nThe experiment is conducted in two stages. First, a solution containing only the Luminase protein is analyzed using time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. The average fluorescence lifetime of the donor in the absence of the acceptor, $\\tau_D$, is measured to be 4.0 ns.\n\nIn the second stage, an excess of Quenchidin protein is added to the solution, allowing it to bind to Luminase. The fluorescence lifetime measurement is repeated for Luminase in the presence of Quenchidin. This new lifetime, $\\tau_{DA}$, is found to be 1.0 ns. The decrease in lifetime is attributed to the FRET process providing an additional pathway for the excited Luminase to return to its ground state.\n\nBased on these experimental results, calculate the FRET efficiency, which represents the fraction of energy transfer events occurring for each donor excitation event.

The fluorescence lifetime of the donor in the absence of the acceptor is $\\tau_D$. When the acceptor is present and energy transfer can occur, it introduces a new, non-radiative decay pathway for the donor's excited state. This causes the observed fluorescence lifetime of the donor to decrease to a new value, $\\tau_{DA}$.\n\nThe efficiency $E$ is defined as the ratio of the rate of energy transfer to the sum of all donor decay rates (including energy transfer, fluorescence, and other non-radiative processes).
