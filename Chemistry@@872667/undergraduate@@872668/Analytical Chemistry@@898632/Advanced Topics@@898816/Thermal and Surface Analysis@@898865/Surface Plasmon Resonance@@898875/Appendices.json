When studying interactions between molecules of vastly different sizes, the choice of which molecule to immobilize (the ligand) versus which to flow over the surface (the analyte) has profound consequences for data quality. This exercise challenges you to think strategically about how to configure an experiment to generate the strongest, most reliable signal [@problem_id:1478778].", "problem": "An analytical chemist is designing an experiment using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) to study the binding interaction between a large protein receptor, \"Receptin,\" which has a molecular weight of 150 kDa, and a small molecule drug, \"DrugX,\" which has a molecular weight of 500 Da. The binding stoichiometry is known to be 1:1. In an SPR experiment, one molecule (the ligand) is immobilized onto the sensor chip surface, and the other molecule (the analyte) is flowed over the surface in solution. The binding is detected as a change in the SPR signal, measured in Response Units (RU). To achieve the highest possible signal-to-noise ratio and obtain the most robust data, the chemist wants to maximize the SPR signal generated upon binding.\n\nWhich of the following experimental designs is the most appropriate to achieve this goal, and for what reason?\n\nA. Immobilize the protein, Receptin, because its larger size allows for more stable immobilization and provides a stronger baseline signal.\n\nB. Immobilize the drug, DrugX, because the binding of the much larger protein analyte will cause a greater mass change on the sensor surface per binding event.\n\nC. Immobilize the protein, Receptin, because the smaller drug analyte can diffuse more quickly to the surface, leading to a faster and more easily measured association rate.\n\nD. It makes no difference which molecule is immobilized. Since the binding is 1:1, the molar amounts that interact are equal, and thus the signal will be the same regardless of the setup.", "solution": "In Surface Plasmon Resonance, the measured response is proportional to the change in mass localized near the sensor surface. Denote the response by $R$ and the mass near the surface by $m_{\\mathrm{surf}}$. The fundamental proportionality is\n$$\n\\Delta R=\\alpha\\,\\Delta m_{\\mathrm{surf}},\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is an instrument- and surface-specific proportionality constant.\n\nFor a 1:1 binding interaction with a ligand immobilized on the chip and an analyte in solution, let $N_{\\mathrm{L}}$ be the surface density of active ligand binding sites (in moles per unit area), $\\theta$ the fractional occupancy, and $M_{\\mathrm{A}}$ the molar mass of the analyte. The mass added upon binding is then\n$$\n\\Delta m_{\\mathrm{surf}}=N_{\\mathrm{L}}\\theta M_{\\mathrm{A}},\n$$\nso the response change is\n$$\n\\Delta R=\\alpha\\,N_{\\mathrm{L}}\\theta M_{\\mathrm{A}}.\n$$\nThus, for a given number of active sites and the same fractional occupancy, the signal scales directly with the analyte’s molar mass $M_{\\mathrm{A}}$.\n\nApplying this to the two possible configurations:\n- If the protein (Receptin) is the analyte and the drug (DrugX) is immobilized, then $M_{\\mathrm{A}}$ equals the protein’s molar mass, which is much larger than that of the drug. This yields a large $\\Delta R$.\n- If the drug is the analyte and the protein is immobilized, then $M_{\\mathrm{A}}$ equals the drug’s molar mass, which is much smaller, yielding a much smaller $\\Delta R$.\n\nTherefore, to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio by maximizing $\\Delta R$, one should immobilize the small molecule (DrugX) and flow the large protein (Receptin) as the analyte.\n\nAddressing the options:\n- Option A is incorrect because the baseline immobilized mass does not determine the binding signal; the relevant quantity is the mass change upon analyte binding.\n- Option C is not the most appropriate choice for maximizing signal amplitude; while smaller analytes may have larger diffusion coefficients, $\\Delta R$ is governed by added mass, not diffusion rate.\n- Option D is incorrect because the SPR response depends on mass accumulation, not simply on molar stoichiometry; in a 1:1 system, different analyte masses yield different responses.\n\nHence, the correct design and reason are captured by immobilizing the drug to detect binding of the much heavier protein analyte, which maximizes the SPR signal per binding event.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1478778"}, {"introduction": "Beyond determining binding affinity, SPR is a powerful tool for elucidating the thermodynamics that govern molecular interactions.
