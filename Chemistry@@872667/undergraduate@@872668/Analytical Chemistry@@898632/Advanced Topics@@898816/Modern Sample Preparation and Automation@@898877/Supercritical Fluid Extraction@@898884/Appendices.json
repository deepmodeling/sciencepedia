The critical point of carbon dioxide is defined by a critical temperature $T_c = 31.1^\\circ\\text{C}$ and a critical pressure $P_c = 72.8 \\text{ atm}$. A substance becomes a supercritical fluid only when both its temperature and pressure are above its critical point values. These fluids possess a unique combination of liquid-like density, which provides good solvating power, and gas-like low viscosity and high diffusivity, which allows for efficient penetration into the sample matrix and rapid mass transfer.\n\nThe intended operating conditions for the extraction are a pressure of $200 \\text{ atm}$ and a temperature of $60.0^\\circ\\text{C}$. However, due to a malfunction in the oven's thermostat, the system operates at the correct pressure of $200 \\text{ atm}$ but at a much lower, constant temperature of $20.0^\\circ\\text{C}$. After running the extraction for the standard duration, the chemist finds that the yield of caffeine is negligible.\n\nWhich of the following statements best describes the physical state of the carbon dioxide in the extraction vessel and the primary scientific reason for the failure of the extraction process under these unintended conditions?\n\nA. The carbon dioxide is a liquid. The extraction fails primarily because the mass transfer of the analyte is severely limited by the low diffusivity and high viscosity of the liquid compared to a supercritical fluid.\n\nB. The carbon dioxide is a gas. The extraction fails because a gas has a very low density and therefore possesses negligible solvating power for a non-volatile compound like caffeine.\n\nC. The carbon dioxide is a solid (dry ice). The extraction fails because a solid cannot act as a solvent to penetrate the coffee bean matrix and dissolve the caffeine.\n\nD. The carbon dioxide is a biphasic mixture of liquid and gas. The extraction fails because the fluctuating and non-uniform density within the vessel leads to inconsistent and poor overall solvation.\n\nE. The carbon dioxide is still a supercritical fluid, but at a lower energy state. The extraction fails because the solvating power of a supercritical fluid is directly proportional to temperature, and at $20.0^\\circ\\text{C}$ it is too low.", "solution": "The critical point of carbon dioxide is specified by $T_{c}=31.1^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ and $P_{c}=72.8\\ \\text{atm}$. By definition of a supercritical fluid, the condition for the supercritical state is\n$$T>T_{c}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad P>P_{c}.$$\nThe intended operating point, $T=60.0^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ and $P=200\\ \\text{atm}$, satisfies both inequalities, so it would indeed be supercritical. However, the actual operation is at $T=20.0^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ and $P=200\\ \\text{atm}$. Relative to the critical values, this gives\n$$T<T_{c},\\qquad P>P_{c}.$$\nFor a pure substance at a temperature below the critical temperature, the phase at a given pressure is determined by comparison to the saturation vapor pressure $P_{\\text{sat}}(T)$. Specifically, for $T<T_{c}$,\n$$\\begin{cases}\nP>P_{\\text{sat}}(T)\\ \\Rightarrow\\ \\text{compressed liquid},\\\\\nP<P_{\\text{sat}}(T)\\ \\Rightarrow\\ \\text{vapor (gas)}.\n\\end{cases}$$\nMoreover, for any $T<T_{c}$, it holds that $P_{\\text{sat}}(T)<P_{c}$. Therefore, at $T=20.0^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ with $P=200\\ \\text{atm}$ we have\n$$P> P_{c} > P_{\\text{sat}}(T),$$\nwhich places the system unambiguously in the single-phase liquid region (a compressed liquid), not in a supercritical state, not a gas, and not a biphasic mixture.\n\nSupercritical fluid extraction relies on the combination of liquid-like density (good solvating power) and gas-like transport properties (low viscosity and high diffusivity) to achieve rapid penetration and mass transfer within the sample matrix. Replacing the supercritical fluid with a liquid removes the gas-like transport advantages: the viscosity is higher and the diffusivity is lower in the liquid phase, which severely limits mass transfer and slows extraction kinetics. Under the standard (short) SFE duration, this leads to a negligible yield. This directly corresponds to the statement that the fluid is liquid and the primary failure mechanism is mass transfer limitation due to liquid-like transport properties.\n\nHence, the correct choice is that the carbon dioxide is a liquid and the extraction fails primarily because of low diffusivity and high viscosity compared to a supercritical fluid.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1478261"}, {"introduction": "Successful extraction is not just about the solvent, but also its interaction with the sample matrix. This practical scenario [@problem_id:1478259] delves into a common challenge in SFE: extracting nonpolar analytes from a high-moisture sample using nonpolar supercritical $\\text{CO}_2$. This problem will challenge you to apply principles of polarity and mass transfer to predict and explain the outcome, a crucial skill in method development.", "problem": "An analytical chemist is tasked with developing a quality control method to determine the total lipid content (primarily nonpolar triglycerides) in a new plant-based food product. The product has a very high moisture content, typically around 85% water by mass. The proposed method is Supercritical Fluid Extraction (SFE) using pure carbon dioxide ($\\text{CO}_2$) as the extraction fluid.

The extraction efficiency will be significantly enhanced because the water will act as a co-solvent, increasing the overall solvating power of the supercritical fluid.\n\nB. The extraction efficiency will be largely unaffected because the gas-like low viscosity and high diffusivity of supercritical $\\text{CO}_2$ allow it to easily bypass the water molecules and penetrate the entire sample matrix.\n\nC. The extraction efficiency will be significantly reduced because the high pressure will cause the water to freeze, creating an ice barrier that blocks the flow of the supercritical fluid.\n\nD. The extraction efficiency will be significantly reduced because the polar water will form a physical barrier, limiting the mass transfer of the nonpolar lipids into the nonpolar supercritical $\\text{CO}_2$ fluid.\n\nE. The extraction efficiency will be significantly enhanced because the water will hydrolyze the triglycerides into more polar fatty acids and glycerol, which are more soluble in supercritical $\\text{CO}_2$.", "solution": "We analyze supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) of nonpolar triglycerides using pure carbon dioxide. The key principles are:\n1) Like-dissolves-like: neat supercritical $\\text{CO}_2$ is a low-polarity solvent that efficiently dissolves nonpolar solutes (e.g., triglycerides), but has poor affinity for polar substances such as water.\n2) Miscibility: water has very limited solubility in supercritical $\\text{CO}_2$ under typical SFE conditions; therefore, water does not function as an effective co-solvent for $\\text{CO}_2$ in this context.\n3) Mass transfer in porous media: the solute flux $J$ through the sample is governed by Fick’s law, $J=-D_{\\text{eff}} \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}$, where the effective diffusivity $D_{\\text{eff}}$ in a water-saturated matrix is reduced according to $D_{\\text{eff}}=D \\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\tau}$, with $\\varepsilon$ the porosity and $\\tau$ the tortuosity. High water content decreases $\\varepsilon$ and increases $\\tau$, thus decreasing $D_{\\text{eff}}$ and the mass transfer rate.\n4) Interfacial mass transfer: a typical rate expression is $N=k a \\left(C^{*}-C_{b}\\right)$, where $k$ is the mass-transfer coefficient, $a$ the interfacial area per volume, $C^{*}$ the equilibrium solubility of the solute in the supercritical phase at the interface, and $C_{b}$ the bulk concentration. A continuous polar water phase around the sample reduces both $k$ (by adding a diffusion barrier) and $a$ (by decreasing the direct contact area between the lipid-containing domains and the supercritical $\\text{CO}_2$).\n\nGiven a moisture content of approximately $0.85$ by mass, the aqueous phase becomes dominant in the sample. Because neat supercritical $\\text{CO}_2$ is immiscible with water, it does not penetrate and mix with the aqueous phase to increase solvating power. Instead, the water forms a physical barrier around and within the matrix, limiting the contact between the nonpolar triglycerides and the nonpolar supercritical $\\text{CO}_2$. Consequently:\n- The effective diffusivity $D_{\\text{eff}}$ is reduced due to decreased porosity and increased tortuosity caused by water filling the pore spaces.\n- The interfacial area $a$ available for triglyceride transfer into supercritical $\\text{CO}_2$ is reduced because water films coat particle surfaces and internal structures.\n- The mass-transfer coefficient $k$ is lowered by the additional diffusion resistance of the water layer.\n- There is no beneficial co-solvent effect from water because its miscibility with $\\text{CO}_2$ is very low; thus $C^{*}$ is not increased by water acting as a modifier.\n\nWe can eliminate the other options on physical grounds:\n- A is incorrect: water does not act as an effective co-solvent for $\\text{CO}_2$; modifiers typically used to increase polarity are alcohols (e.g., ethanol), not water.\n- B is incorrect: while supercritical $\\text{CO}_2$ has gas-like diffusivity and low viscosity, a continuous aqueous phase at high loading imposes a significant mass-transfer barrier; thus extraction is not unaffected.\n- C is incorrect: supercritical operation requires $T>T_{c, \\text{CO}_2}$, so freezing of water due to pressure does not occur; pressure alone does not freeze water in this regime.\n- E is incorrect: extensive hydrolysis of triglycerides requires appropriate conditions (e.g., catalysts, elevated temperatures and times). Moreover, the hydrolysis products are more polar and generally less soluble in neat supercritical $\\text{CO}_2$.\n\nTherefore, the high moisture content significantly reduces the extraction efficiency primarily because the polar water forms a physical and diffusional barrier that limits mass transfer of nonpolar lipids into the nonpolar supercritical $\\text{CO}_2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1478259"}, {"introduction": "To truly optimize an SFE method, we must move beyond qualitative principles to quantitative modeling.
