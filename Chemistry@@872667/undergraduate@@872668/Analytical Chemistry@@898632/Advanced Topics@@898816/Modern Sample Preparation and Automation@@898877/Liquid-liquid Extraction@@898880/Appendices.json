An emulsion consists of fine droplets stabilized at the interface; to break it efficiently and safely, one should modify solution properties to promote droplet coalescence and phase separation without increasing hazard.\n\nThe most effective simple approach is to increase the ionic strength of the aqueous phase to induce a salting-out effect. Increasing ionic strength, quantified by the ionic strength $I$,\n$$\nI=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum c_{i} z_{i}^{2},\n$$\ncompresses electrical double layers around droplets, reduces stabilization of interfacial films, increases the interfacial tension $\\gamma$ between the aqueous and organic phases (typically $\\frac{\\partial \\gamma}{\\partial c_{\\text{salt}}}>0$ for electrolytes in water with nonpolar solvents), and decreases the solubility of organic compounds in the aqueous phase.
