{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The chemical shift of a nucleus is fundamentally determined by its local electronic environment. This first practice challenges you to apply the concept of electronegativity to predict how electron-withdrawing or -donating groups affect nuclear shielding and, consequently, the position of a signal in a $^{13}$C NMR spectrum. Understanding this principle is the first step towards interpreting NMR data to deduce molecular structure. [@problem_id:1429831]", "problem": "In the field of analytical chemistry, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful technique for determining the structure of molecules. The chemical shift, denoted by $\\delta$ and measured in parts per million (ppm), provides information about the local electronic environment of an atomic nucleus. The spectrum is typically referenced against an internal standard, such as tetramethylsilane (TMS, $\\text{Si}(\\text{CH}_3)_4$), for which the chemical shift is defined as $\\delta=0.0$ ppm.\n\nConsider the $^{13}$C NMR spectra of two simple organic molecules: methane ($\\text{CH}_4$) and tetrachloromethane ($\\text{CCl}_4$). Let $\\delta_{\\text{CH}_4}$ be the chemical shift of the carbon atom in methane and $\\delta_{\\text{CCl}_4}$ be the chemical shift of the carbon atom in tetrachloromethane. Based on fundamental principles of electronic structure and its effect on NMR chemical shifts, which of the following statements correctly describes the relationship between $\\delta_{\\text{CH}_4}$ and $\\delta_{\\text{CCl}_4}$ and provides the correct reasoning?\n\nA. $\\delta_{\\text{CH}_4} > \\delta_{\\text{CCl}_4}$, because the four hydrogen atoms are less massive than the four chlorine atoms, resulting in a higher resonant frequency for the carbon in methane.\n\nB. $\\delta_{\\text{CCl}_4} > \\delta_{\\text{CH}_4}$, because the high electronegativity of the chlorine atoms withdraws electron density from the central carbon, causing it to be deshielded and resonate at a higher chemical shift.\n\nC. $\\delta_{\\text{CH}_4} > \\delta_{\\text{CCl}_4}$, because the four large chlorine atoms in CCl$_4$ possess more electrons overall, providing a greater shielding effect on the carbon nucleus compared to the hydrogen atoms in CH$_4$.\n\nD. $\\delta_{\\text{CCl}_4} \\approx \\delta_{\\text{CH}_4}$, because both molecules are nonpolar and have a perfectly tetrahedral geometry, leading to a net-zero inductive effect on the central carbon atom.", "solution": "The central principle governing Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) chemical shifts is the concept of electronic shielding. A nucleus is surrounded by electrons. When an external magnetic field, $B_0$, is applied, these electrons circulate and generate a small, local induced magnetic field, $B_{\\text{induced}}$, that opposes the external field. The effective magnetic field experienced by the nucleus is therefore $B_{\\text{eff}} = B_0 - B_{\\text{induced}}$. This phenomenon is called **shielding**.\n\nA higher electron density around a nucleus leads to a larger $B_{\\text{induced}}$, which means the nucleus is more shielded. A more shielded nucleus experiences a weaker effective magnetic field ($B_{\\text{eff}}$) and thus resonates at a lower frequency for a given $B_0$. By convention in NMR, a lower frequency corresponds to a smaller chemical shift ($\\delta$), a position referred to as **upfield**.\n\nConversely, if electron density is withdrawn from the vicinity of a nucleus, $B_{\\text{induced}}$ is smaller, and the nucleus is less shielded, or **deshielded**. A deshielded nucleus experiences a stronger effective magnetic field ($B_{\\text{eff}}$) and resonates at a higher frequency. A higher frequency corresponds to a larger chemical shift ($\\delta$), a position referred to as **downfield**.\n\nWe can apply this principle to methane ($\\text{CH}_4$) and tetrachloromethane ($\\text{CCl}_4$) by considering the electronegativity of the atoms bonded to the central carbon. Electronegativity is a measure of an atom's ability to attract shared electrons in a chemical bond.\nThe electronegativity values on the Pauling scale are approximately:\n- Carbon (C): 2.55\n- Hydrogen (H): 2.20\n- Chlorine (Cl): 3.16\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Methane ($\\text{CH}_4$)**\nIn the C-H bonds of methane, carbon is slightly more electronegative than hydrogen. This means that the electron density in the bonds is slightly polarized towards the carbon atom. This leads to a relatively high electron density around the carbon nucleus in methane, making it a well-shielded nucleus. Consequently, the $^{13}$C chemical shift for methane ($\\delta_{\\text{CH}_4}$) is expected to be small and upfield (close to the TMS standard). In fact, its experimental value is approximately -2 ppm.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Tetrachloromethane ($\\text{CCl}_4$)**\nIn the C-Cl bonds of tetrachloromethane, chlorine is significantly more electronegative than carbon. As a result, each of the four chlorine atoms strongly withdraws electron density from the central carbon atom via the inductive effect. This drastically reduces the electron density around the carbon nucleus. The carbon nucleus in $\\text{CCl}_4$ is therefore strongly deshielded. This deshielding effect will cause it to resonate at a much higher frequency, resulting in a large, downfield chemical shift ($\\delta_{\\text{CCl}_4}$). Its experimental value is approximately 96 ppm.\n\n**Step 3: Compare and Conclude**\nComparing the two, the carbon in $\\text{CCl}_4$ is heavily deshielded while the carbon in $\\text{CH}_4$ is shielded. Therefore, the chemical shift of tetrachloromethane will be significantly larger than that of methane: $\\delta_{\\text{CCl}_4} > \\delta_{\\text{CH}_4}$.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options**\n- **A:** This is incorrect. The mass of the substituents is not the primary factor determining chemical shift. It is the electronic environment.\n- **B:** This statement correctly claims that $\\delta_{\\text{CCl}_4} > \\delta_{\\text{CH}_4}$. The reasoning provided is also correct: the high electronegativity of chlorine withdraws electron density (deshielding), leading to a higher chemical shift.\n- **C:** This statement has the incorrect relationship ($\\delta_{\\text{CH}_4} > \\delta_{\\text{CCl}_4}$). The reasoning is flawed; although chlorine atoms have more electrons than hydrogen atoms, their high electronegativity causes them to pull electron density *away* from the carbon, resulting in deshielding, not shielding.\n- **D:** This statement is incorrect. While both molecules are nonpolar overall due to their tetrahedral symmetry, this symmetry does not negate the strong local inductive effects of the highly polar C-Cl bonds. The local electronic environment is what matters for chemical shift, and it is vastly different in the two molecules.\n\nThus, the only correct statement and reasoning is provided in option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1429831"}, {"introduction": "While we report chemical shifts in the field-independent unit of parts per million (ppm), NMR spectrometers measure resonance as a frequency (Hz).
