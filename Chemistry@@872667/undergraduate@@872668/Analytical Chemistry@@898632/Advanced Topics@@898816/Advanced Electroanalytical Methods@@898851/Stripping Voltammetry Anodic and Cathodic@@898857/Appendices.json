The ASV technique involves two primary steps: a deposition step, where a negative potential is applied to a working electrode to reduce and preconcentrate metal ions from the solution into a mercury amalgam, followed by a stripping step, where the potential is scanned anodically (towards more positive values) to oxidize the metals back into the solution, generating a measurable current.\n\nFor a successful simultaneous analysis, the deposition potential, $E_{dep}$, must be sufficiently negative to ensure that all three target metal ions (Cd$^{2+}$, Pb$^{2+}$, and Cu$^{2+}$) are effectively reduced and deposited onto the electrode.

This exercise presents a classic analytical puzzle where the signal for one metal is distorted by the presence of another. By diagnosing the cause, you will explore the important phenomenon of intermetallic compound formation within the electrode, a key type of matrix interference that can significantly affect accuracy in simultaneous multi-element analysis [@problem_id:1538463].", "problem": "An analytical chemist is tasked with determining the simultaneous concentration of trace copper (Cu²⁺) and zinc (Zn²⁺) in an industrial wastewater sample using Anodic Stripping Voltammetry (ASV) with a Hanging Mercury Drop Electrode (HMDE). The procedure involves a deposition step where a potential of -1.20 V versus a standard reference electrode is applied for 120 seconds. During this time, both metal ions are reduced and concentrated as amalgams in the mercury drop. This is followed by a stripping step where the potential is scanned linearly towards more positive values, causing the metals to be re-oxidized and producing a current that is proportional to their concentration.\n\nThe analysis of the wastewater sample yields a voltammogram with a sharp, well-defined peak for copper stripping near -0.2 V. However, the signal for zinc, which is expected to appear as a sharp peak around -1.0 V, is observed to be significantly suppressed in magnitude, broadened, and shifted to a slightly more positive potential than expected. A control experiment using a standard solution containing only Zn²⁺ at a similar concentration produces a sharp, symmetric peak at the correct potential.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most plausible chemical explanation for the observed suppression and distortion of the zinc stripping peak specifically in the sample containing both copper and zinc?\n\nA. The presence of copper ions in the solution catalyzes the re-oxidation of the zinc amalgam before the stripping scan begins, leading to a lower overall signal.\n\nB. During the deposition step, the standard reduction potential of Cu²⁺ is sufficiently positive that it deposits preferentially, creating a physical barrier on the mercury surface that hinders the subsequent deposition of Zn²⁺.\n\nC. The pH of the wastewater sample is slightly acidic, causing hydrogen gas evolution at the deposition potential, which co-deposits into the amalgam and interferes specifically with zinc's electrochemical properties.\n\nD. Within the confined volume of the mercury drop, the deposited copper and zinc atoms react to form a stable intermetallic compound, which is thermodynamically more difficult to oxidize than pure zinc amalgam.\n\nE. The supporting electrolyte used in the analysis forms a much stronger and more stable complex with Zn²⁺ ions than with Cu²⁺ ions, thereby reducing the effective concentration of free Zn²⁺ available for deposition.", "solution": "In anodic stripping voltammetry at a hanging mercury drop electrode, target cations are reduced during a deposition step to form an amalgam with mercury, and then they are re-oxidized during the stripping scan. For a metal ion $M^{z+}$ forming an amalgam $M(\\text{Hg})$, the equilibrium potential for the reduction half-reaction $M^{z+} + z e^{-} \\rightleftharpoons M(\\text{Hg})$ is governed by the Nernst equation\n$$\nE = E^{0}_{M^{z+}/M(\\text{Hg})} + \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{a_{M^{z+}}}{a_{M(\\text{Hg})}}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $a_{M^{z+}}$ is the activity of the solvated ion and $a_{M(\\text{Hg})}$ is the activity of the metal in the amalgam phase.

Copper and zinc exhibit strong mutual interactions and can form mixed phases (solid solutions or intermetallic-like domains) within the amalgam. This has two key consequences for the zinc stripping response:\n\n1) Thermodynamic effect on potential: Formation of a Cu–Zn mixed phase stabilizes zinc in the amalgam and lowers its effective activity $a_{\\text{Zn}(\\text{Hg})}$ relative to a pure $\\text{Zn}$–Hg amalgam. From the Nernst relation above, decreasing $a_{\\text{Zn}(\\text{Hg})}$ increases $\\ln\\!\\big(a_{\\text{Zn}^{2+}}/a_{\\text{Zn}(\\text{Hg})}\\big)$ and therefore shifts $E_{\\text{Zn}}$ to more positive values. Moreover, because the local composition of the ternary Hg–Cu–Zn amalgam is heterogeneous, $a_{\\text{Zn}(\\text{Hg})}$ is distributed over a range of values, so the oxidation of zinc occurs over a spread of potentials, broadening the peak.\n\n2) Kinetic and dealloying effects: Oxidation of zinc embedded in a Cu-rich environment requires dealloying and may proceed via multiple steps with slower charge-transfer and solid-state diffusion, which reduces the peak current and broadens the response. A fraction of zinc can be retained in more stable Cu–Zn domains during the scan window, further suppressing the apparent zinc signal.\n\nThese behaviors—suppressed magnitude, broadening, and a shift to more positive potential—are hallmarks of alloy or intermetallic formation affecting the activity and stripping kinetics of the less noble metal (zinc) in the presence of the more noble metal (copper). The copper peak remains sharp because copper is less affected by zinc at its oxidation potential and because its own activity in the amalgam is not similarly suppressed at the relevant potential range.\n\nThe alternative options are less consistent with the observations:\n- A would mostly reduce the amount of zinc available to strip but would not inherently cause a broadened peak and systematic positive shift; furthermore, pre-scan re-oxidation catalyzed by dissolved copper is not expected under these deposition conditions.\n- B posits a physical barrier on mercury, but both metals form amalgams rather than a blocking film; deposition is simultaneous, and such a barrier mechanism is not consistent with HMDE behavior.\n- C (hydrogen evolution) would affect both the sample and the zinc-only control under the same potential and medium; it would not selectively distort zinc only in the presence of copper while leaving the copper peak sharp.\n- E would also suppress zinc in the control if the same supporting electrolyte were used; the control shows a sharp zinc peak, contradicting this explanation.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible explanation is the formation of a stable Cu–Zn mixed phase within the mercury drop that stabilizes zinc and complicates its oxidation, yielding a suppressed, broadened, and positively shifted zinc stripping peak.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1538463"}, {"introduction": "Ultimately, the goal of an analytical measurement is to obtain an accurate concentration.
