The index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) determines the number of rings and/or multiple bonds: $\\text{IHD}=\\frac{2C+2-H}{2}=\\frac{2\\cdot 6+2-10}{2}=\\frac{14-10}{2}=2$.\nAn IHD of $2$ is consistent with either one alkyne (which counts as two degrees), a diene (two double bonds), or a cyclic alkene (one ring and one double bond).\n\nThe reaction conditions are $H_2$ with palladium on calcium carbonate poisoned with lead(II) acetate and quinoline. This is the Lindlar catalyst. The key principle is selective, syn-addition partial hydrogenation of an alkyne to a cis (Z) alkene, stopping at the alkene and not reducing further. Under these conditions, isolated alkenes are not appreciably hydrogenated, and dienes or cycloalkenes would not selectively give a single (Z)-3-hexene.\n\nThe product is specifically given as $(Z)$-3-hexene, which is the cis-alkene with the double bond between C3 and C4. By syn addition on an alkyne, the only way to place the double bond at C3–C4 and obtain the Z stereochemistry is to start from the corresponding internal alkyne at that position, namely 3-hexyne.\n\nCheck each option against Lindlar hydrogenation:\n- A. 1-Hexyne would give 1-hexene (no E/Z), not $(Z)$-3-hexene.\n- B. 2-Hexyne would give $(Z)$-2-hexene, wrong position.\n- C. 3-Hexyne would give $(Z)$-3-hexene by syn addition, correct position and stereochemistry.\n- D. 1,5-Hexadiene is an alkadiene; Lindlar catalyst does not selectively convert it to $(Z)$-3-hexene, and no single stereodefined product at C3–C4 would result.\n- E. Cyclohexene under Lindlar conditions is not reduced to an acyclic $(Z)$-3-hexene; at most, stronger catalysts could hydrogenate it to cyclohexane.\n\nTherefore, only 3-hexyne is consistent with the observed product $(Z)$-3-hexene under Lindlar hydrogenation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2188616"}, {"introduction": "Organic synthesis rarely involves a single step; chemists often build complex molecules through carefully planned sequences of reactions.

The IR diagnostic changes must reflect consumption of the alkyne functional group and formation of a cis-disubstituted alkene.\n\nFirst, identify diagnostic IR features of the starting material:\n- Internal alkyne $\\text{C}\\equiv\\text{C}$ stretching gives a weak absorption in the region from $2100$ to $2260\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. Although internal alkynes often show weak or even absent intensity due to symmetry, the expected change upon hydrogenation is the loss of any $\\text{C}\\equiv\\text{C}$ absorption present. Therefore, the disappearance of a weak absorption in this region is consistent with consumption of 3-hexyne, supporting option A.\n- A sharp, strong absorption around $3300\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ corresponds to the $\\equiv\\mathrm{C}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{H}$ stretch of a terminal alkyne. Because 3-hexyne is an internal alkyne, it does not possess a terminal $\\equiv\\text{C-H}$ bond and thus does not show this band to begin with. Its “disappearance” is not a valid indicator here, so option C is not correct for this system.\n\nSecond, identify diagnostic IR features of the product:\n- An internal alkene introduces $=\\text{C-H}$ stretching absorptions of medium intensity in the region from $3000$ to $3100\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. 3-hexene has vinylic hydrogens, so the appearance of new absorptions in this region is expected. This supports option E.\n- The out-of-plane $=\\text{C-H}$ bending absorptions in the $650$ to $1000\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ region diagnose alkene substitution and stereochemistry. A cis-disubstituted alkene shows a strong band in the region from $675$ to $730\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, whereas a trans-disubstituted alkene shows a strong band near $960$ to $970\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. Since the desired product is (Z)-3-hexene (cis-disubstituted), the appearance of a strong band in the $675$ to $730\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ region confirms formation of the cis alkene (option B). Conversely, a new strong absorption around $970\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ would indicate trans geometry and is therefore inconsistent with the target product (option D is incorrect).\n\nCollectively, the correct confirming changes are: disappearance of the alkyne $\\text{C}\\equiv\\text{C}$ stretch (A), appearance of the cis-alkene out-of-plane bend (B), and appearance of the vinylic $=\\text{C-H}$ stretch just above $3000\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ (E).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABE}$$", "id": "2188632"}]}
