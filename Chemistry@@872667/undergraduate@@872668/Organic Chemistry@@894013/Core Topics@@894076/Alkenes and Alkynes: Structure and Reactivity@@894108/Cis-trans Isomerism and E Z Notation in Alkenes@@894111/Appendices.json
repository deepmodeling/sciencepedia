Bromine and Propyl", "solution": "The problem asks us to identify the higher priority groups on carbon-2 and carbon-3 of (E)-2-bromo-3-methyl-2-pentene based on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the structure based on the IUPAC name:\n- The parent chain is `pentene`, which signifies a 5-carbon chain containing a double bond.\n- The `-2-ene` suffix indicates that the double bond starts at carbon-2, so it is between C-2 and C-3.\n- The substituent `-2-bromo` means a bromine atom is attached to C-2.\n- The substituent `-3-methyl` means a methyl group, $-\\text{CH}_3$, is attached to C-3.\n\nLet's identify the two groups attached to each carbon of the double bond.\n- **Carbon-2 (C-2):** One part of the double bond. The rest of the parent chain attached to C-2 is C-1, which is a methyl group ($-\\text{CH}_3$). The other substituent on C-2 is a bromine atom ($-\\text{Br}$). So, the two groups on C-2 are a methyl group and a bromine atom.\n- **Carbon-3 (C-3):** The other part of the double bond. The rest of the parent chain consists of C-4 and C-5, which form an ethyl group ($-\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3$). The other substituent on C-3 is a methyl group ($-\\text{CH}_3$). So, the two groups on C-3 are an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n\nNow, we apply the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules to each carbon of the double bond.\n\n**Analysis of C-2:**\nThe two groups attached to C-2 are a bromine atom ($-\\text{Br}$) and a methyl group ($-\\text{CH}_3$).\n- **Rule 1:** Priority is determined by the atomic number of the atom directly bonded to the stereocenter (in this case, C-2).\n- The atom directly bonded from the bromine group is $\\text{Br}$ (atomic number Z = 35).\n- The atom directly bonded from the methyl group is $\\text{C}$ (atomic number Z = 6).\n- Since 35  6, the bromine group has a higher priority than the methyl group.\n- The higher priority group on C-2 is **Bromine**.\n\n**Analysis of C-3:**\nThe two groups attached to C-3 are a methyl group ($-\\text{CH}_3$) and an ethyl group ($-\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3$).\n- **Rule 1:** We examine the atoms directly bonded to C-3. For the methyl group, it's a carbon atom. For the ethyl group, it's also a carbon atom. This is a tie.\n- **Rule 2:** When there is a tie, we move to the next atoms along each chain and compare them. We create a list of atoms attached to the tied atoms, ordered by decreasing atomic number.\n- For the methyl group ($-\\text{CH}_3$), the carbon atom is bonded to (H, H, H).\n- For the ethyl group ($-\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3$), the first carbon atom (`-CH_2-`) is bonded to one carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms: (C, H, H).\n- We compare the two lists element by element: (C, H, H) for ethyl versus (H, H, H) for methyl.\n- The first element in the ethyl list is $\\text{C}$, and the first element in the methyl list is $\\text{H}$.\n- Since the atomic number of carbon (Z=6) is greater than that of hydrogen (Z=1), the ethyl group has higher priority.\n- The higher priority group on C-3 is **Ethyl**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe higher priority group on C-2 is Bromine, and the higher priority group on C-3 is Ethyl.\nThis corresponds to the pair (Bromine, Ethyl). Reviewing the options:\nA. Bromine and Ethyl\nB. Bromine and Methyl\nC. Methyl and Ethyl\nD. Methyl and Methyl\nE. Bromine and Propyl\n\nThe correct option is A. The `(E)` designation in the name indicates that these two higher priority groups are on opposite (*entgegen*) sides of the double bond, but this information is not needed to determine the priorities themselves.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2160389"}, {"introduction": "Before applying the CIP rules, a crucial first step is to determine if a molecule can exhibit geometric isomerism at all. A common pitfall is attempting to assign an $E$ or $Z$ configuration to a structure where it is impossible. This practice problem highlights such a case, forcing you to identify the fundamental structural requirement for E/Z isomerism: each carbon atom of the double bond must be bonded to two different groups [@problem_id:2160414].", "problem": "An undergraduate student is tasked with naming an alkene. After analyzing its structure, the student proposes the name (E)-3-methyl-1-butene. However, this name contains a fundamental error based on the nomenclature rules established by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate explanation for why the proposed name is incorrect?\n\nA. The parent chain is incorrectly identified; the molecule should be named as a derivative of pentane.\nB. The locant for the methyl group is incorrect; the number should be 2, not 3, to give the substituent the lowest possible number.\nC. The stereodescriptor \"(E)\" is invalid because the carbon at position 1 (C1) of the double bond is bonded to two identical hydrogen atoms, which makes stereoisomerism across the double bond impossible for this molecule.\nD. The stereodescriptor is incorrect; it should be \"(Z)\" because the highest-priority groups on each carbon of the double bond are on the same side.\nE. The locant for the double bond is incorrect; the molecule is actually 3-methyl-2-butene.", "solution": "Step 1: Parse the proposed name. The name \"(E)-3-methyl-1-butene\" implies:\n- Parent chain: butene (four carbons with a double bond).\n- Double-bond locant: 1 (double bond between C1 and C2).\n- Substituent: methyl at C3.\n- Stereodescriptor: (E).\n\nStep 2: Verify the parent chain choice. By IUPAC rules, the parent must be the longest continuous chain that contains the double bond. The structure corresponding to 3-methyl-1-butene is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH3. The longest continuous chain containing the double bond has four carbons; there is no way to construct a continuous five-carbon chain because the branching at C3 provides two alternative terminal methyl groups, not an extension to a five-carbon path. Therefore, naming it as a butene is correct, and option A is incorrect.\n\nStep 3: Verify the numbering (locants). IUPAC requires that the double bond receive the lowest possible locant in the parent chain. Numbering from the end nearer the double bond gives locant 1 for the double bond. Reversing the numbering would place the double bond at a higher locant (3), which is disallowed. Consequently, the methyl substituent must be at C3 in this numbering; changing it to C2 would violate the priority of giving the multiple bond the lowest locant. Therefore, option B is incorrect, and option E (which claims the double-bond locant is 2) is also incorrect for this structure.\n\nStep 4: Assess the applicability of the (E)/(Z) stereodescriptor. According to IUPAC and the Cahn–Ingold–Prelog (CIP) rules, (E)/(Z) stereodescriptors can be assigned only if each carbon of the double bond is bonded to two different substituents. In a terminal alkene such as 1-butene derivatives, the carbon at position 1 of the double bond is CH2, bearing two identical hydrogen atoms. Thus, that double-bond carbon does not have two different substituents, and E/Z stereochemistry is not definable. Therefore, including \"(E)\" is fundamentally incorrect. This exactly matches option C.\n\nStep 5: Exclude remaining alternatives. Option D presumes that an E/Z assignment is applicable and merely chooses the wrong descriptor; since E/Z is inapplicable here, D is incorrect.\n\nConclusion: The fundamental error is the use of the E/Z stereodescriptor for a terminal alkene where one double-bond carbon bears two identical substituents (hydrogens), making stereoisomerism across the double bond impossible. The most accurate explanation is option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2160414"}, {"introduction": "In real-world organic molecules, different types of stereoisomerism often coexist. This final exercise challenges you to synthesize your knowledge by analyzing a compound that contains both a stereogenic double bond and stereogenic carbon centers (chiral centers).

This molecule contains multiple features that can give rise to stereoisomerism. By carefully analyzing its structure, determine the total number of unique stereoisomers possible for this compound. Your answer should be a single integer.", "solution": "First, translate the IUPAC name 5-bromo-3-hepten-2-ol into its carbon skeleton and substituents. The main chain has seven carbons with a double bond between C3 and C4 (hept-3-en), a hydroxyl group at C2 (2-ol), and a bromo substituent at C5 (5-bromo). An explicit structural outline consistent with the numbering is:\nC1: CH3; C2: CH(OH); C3: CH=; C4: CH=; C5: CH(Br); C6: CH2; C7: CH3.\n\nIdentify stereogenic elements:\n- Chiral centers:\n  - At C2, the substituents are OH, H, the C1 side (methyl), and the C3 side (allylic chain continuing to the double bond and beyond). These four are distinct, so C2 is a stereogenic center.\n  - At C5, the substituents are Br, H, the C4 side (alkenyl chain) and the C6 side (alkyl chain). These four are distinct, so C5 is a stereogenic center.\nThus, there are $n_{\\text{chiral}}=2$ chiral centers, contributing a factor $2^{2}$ to the total.\n\n- Alkene geometry:\n  The C3=C4 double bond has, at each end, two different substituents: at C3, H versus the C2 substituent; at C4, H versus the C5 substituent. Therefore, E/Z stereoisomerism is possible, giving $n_{\\text{alkene}}=1$ independent geometric element and a factor $2^{1}$.\n\nCompute the maximum number of stereoisomers by combining independent stereogenic elements multiplicatively:\n$$N_{\\max}=2^{n_{\\text{chiral}}}\\times 2^{n_{\\text{alkene}}}=2^{2}\\times 2^{1}=2^{3}=8.$$\n\nAssess possible reductions due to symmetry (meso forms). A meso reduction would require an internal symmetry element mapping one stereocenter onto the other while preserving substituent identity. This molecule is unsymmetrical because the C2 substituent is OH while the corresponding position at C5 bears Br, and the environments on either side of the C3=C4 unit are not identical. Therefore, there is no internal mirror plane or inversion center that could produce a meso form, and no degeneracy reduces the count.\n\nHence, the total number of unique stereoisomers is\n$$N=8.$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8}$$", "id": "2160394"}]}
