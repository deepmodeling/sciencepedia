In hydroboration, B adds to the less substituted carbon (C2) and H to C1, in a concerted syn fashion. After oxidation, OH replaces B at C2 with retention, giving 2-methylcyclohexanol. Because H at C1 and OH at C2 are added syn (same face), and the pre-existing methyl at C1 is opposite to the newly added H at C1, the OH at C2 is on the opposite face relative to the methyl at C1.

Hex-1-ene", "solution": "The problem asks us to identify a starting alkene given its molecular formula and the product obtained from a specific two-step reaction sequence.\n\nFirst, we must identify the reaction and its key characteristics. The two-step process described is the hydroboration-oxidation of an alkene.\n1.  Reaction with borane ($BH_3$) followed by\n2.  Oxidation with hydrogen peroxide ($H_2O_2$) in a basic medium (NaOH).\n\nThis sequence achieves the net addition of water ($H_2O$) across the carbon-carbon double bond of the alkene. The defining feature of hydroboration-oxidation is its regioselectivity: it follows an *anti-Markovnikov* pattern. This means that the hydroxyl group (-OH) is added to the carbon atom of the double bond that is less substituted (i.e., bonded to a greater number of hydrogen atoms).\n\nNext, we analyze the structure of the product, which is 4-methyl-1-pentanol. Let's break down the IUPAC name to draw the structure:\n-   The parent chain is \"pentan-\", indicating a five-carbon chain.\n-   The suffix \"-1-ol\" indicates that a hydroxyl (-OH) group is attached to carbon-1.\n-   The prefix \"4-methyl\" indicates that a methyl ($CH_3$) group is attached to carbon-4.\n\nNumbering the 5-carbon chain from the end with the hydroxyl group, the structure is:\n$$\n\\text{HO}-\\text{CH}_2(1)-\\text{CH}_2(2)-\\text{CH}_2(3)-\\text{CH}(4)(\\text{CH}_3)-\\text{CH}_3(5)\n$$\nThe molecular formula of this product is $C_6H_{14}O$, which is consistent with the addition of one molecule of water ($H_2O$) to an alkene of formula $C_6H_{12}$.\n\nNow, we must work backward from the product to determine the structure of the starting alkene. The hydroboration-oxidation reaction converts a $C=C$ double bond into a $C-C$ single bond, with an -OH group on one of the carbons and an -H on the other. To reverse the reaction, we must remove the -OH group and a hydrogen atom from an adjacent carbon to reform the double bond.\n\nThe -OH group in 4-methyl-1-pentanol is on carbon-1. The only adjacent carbon is carbon-2. Therefore, the double bond in the original alkene must have been located between carbon-1 and carbon-2.\n\nLet's check if this is consistent with the anti-Markovnikov rule. In the hypothetical starting alkene, carbon-1 would be part of the double bond and bonded to two hydrogen atoms, making it a primary carbon ($CH_2=$). Carbon-2 would be bonded to one hydrogen atom, making it a secondary carbon ($-CH=$). The reaction adds the -OH group to the less substituted carbon, which is carbon-1. This is exactly what is observed in the product (4-methyl-1-pentanol), confirming that the double bond was indeed between C1 and C2.\n\nBy removing the -OH group from C1 and a hydrogen atom from C2 of the product, we can deduce the structure of the starting alkene:\n$$\n\\text{CH}_2=\\text{CH-CH}_2-\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_3)-\\text{CH}_3\n$$\nFinally, we need to find the correct IUPAC name for this structure.\n1.  The longest carbon chain containing the double bond has five carbons, so the parent name is \"pentene\".\n2.  We number the chain from the end closest to the double bond, so the double bond starts at carbon-1. The name becomes \"1-pentene\".\n3.  There is a methyl ($CH_3$) group on carbon-4.\n4.  Combining these parts, the full IUPAC name is 4-methyl-1-pentene.\n\nComparing this result with the given choices:\nA. 4-methyl-1-pentene - This matches our derived structure.\nB. 2-methyl-2-pentene - Hydroboration-oxidation would yield 2-methyl-3-pentanol.\nC. 4-methyl-2-pentene - Hydroboration-oxidation would yield a mixture of 4-methyl-2-pentanol and 4-methyl-3-pentanol.\nD. 2-methyl-1-pentene - Hydroboration-oxidation would yield 2-methyl-1-pentanol.\nE. Hex-1-ene - Hydroboration-oxidation would yield 1-hexanol.\n\nTherefore, the only alkene that produces 4-methyl-1-pentanol as the sole major product under these conditions is 4-methyl-1-pentene.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2175924"}]}
