{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The acid-catalyzed hydration of alkenes is a cornerstone reaction in organic synthesis, allowing for the creation of alcohols from simple starting materials. The regioselectivity of this addition is governed by Markovnikov's rule, which dictates that the proton adds to the carbon atom of the double bond that already bears more hydrogen atoms, leading to the formation of the most stable carbocation intermediate. This first exercise [@problem_id:2152153] challenges you to apply this fundamental principle to identify an alkene that cleanly yields a specific alcohol, reinforcing your understanding of carbocation stability and product prediction in the absence of complex rearrangements.", "problem": "An acid-catalyzed hydration reaction is performed to synthesize an alcohol from an alkene with the molecular formula $C_5H_{10}$. Which of the following alkenes will yield 2-pentanol as the sole major constitutional isomer product?\n\nA. 1-Pentene\nB. 2-Pentene\nC. 3-Methyl-1-butene\nD. 2-Methyl-2-butene\nE. Cyclopentene", "solution": "The key mechanistic principle is that acid-catalyzed hydration of an alkene proceeds by Markovnikov addition via a carbocation intermediate: protonation of the double bond gives the more stable carbocation, which may undergo 1,2-shifts if a more stable carbocation can form. Nucleophilic attack by water occurs at the carbocation center, followed by deprotonation to yield the alcohol. The major product distribution is governed by carbocation stability and possible rearrangements. We require the reaction to yield 2-pentanol as the sole major constitutional isomer (stereochemical mixtures are allowed as they are not different constitutional isomers).\n\nEvaluate each option:\n- A. 1-Pentene ($CH_2=CH-CH_2-CH_2-CH_3$): Protonation at the terminal carbon forms a secondary carbocation at $C_2$. A 1,2-hydride shift from $C_3$ to $C_2$ would give another secondary carbocation and does not increase stability, so rearrangement is disfavored. Water attack at $C_2$ gives 2-pentanol as the only major constitutional isomer (formed as a racemic mixture, but constitution is the same).\n- B. 2-Pentene ($CH_3-CH=CH-CH_2-CH_3$): Protonation can occur at either vinylic carbon, each leading to a secondary carbocation ($C_2$ or $C_3$). Subsequent attack gives a mixture of 2-pentanol and 3-pentanol. Therefore, it does not give a sole major constitutional isomer.\n- C. 3-Methyl-1-butene ($CH_2=CH-CH(CH_3)_2$): Protonation to give a secondary carbocation at $C_2$ is followed by a favorable 1,2-hydride shift from $C_3$ to form a tertiary carbocation. Water attack then yields 2-methyl-2-butanol, not 2-pentanol.\n- D. 2-Methyl-2-butene ($(CH_3)_2C=CH-CH_3$): Protonation yields a tertiary carbocation and hydration gives 2-methyl-2-butanol, not 2-pentanol.\n- E. Cyclopentene: This alkene has the molecular formula $C_5H_8$, which does not match the $C_5H_{10}$ specified in the problem. Additionally, its hydration yields cyclopentanol, not 2-pentanol.\n\nTherefore, only 1-pentene yields 2-pentanol as the sole major constitutional isomer product under acid-catalyzed hydration conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2152153"}, {"introduction": "While Markovnikov's rule provides a powerful predictive tool, the story of carbocation intermediates is often more complex. These high-energy species can undergo rapid structural rearrangements to achieve greater stability, a phenomenon known as a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement. In this practice problem [@problem_id:2152142], you will explore a classic case where an initial secondary carbocation rearranges via a 1,2-methyl shift to a more stable tertiary carbocation, a crucial step that ultimately dictates the structure of the final alcohol product.", "problem": "An alkene, 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene, is treated with a dilute aqueous solution of sulfuric acid ($H_2SO_4$). This reaction condition is known to cause the hydration of the alkene, leading to the formation of an alcohol as the major organic product.\n\nWhat is the correct International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name for the major alcohol product formed in this reaction?\n\nA. 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanol\nB. 2,3-dimethyl-2-butanol\nC. 3,3-dimethyl-1-butanol\nD. 2,2-dimethyl-1-butanol\nE. 4-methyl-2-pentanol", "solution": "The reaction conditions are dilute aqueous $H_2SO_4$, which effect acid-catalyzed hydration of an alkene via a stepwise electrophilic addition mechanism proceeding through a carbocation intermediate and following Markovnikov regiochemistry. The general principles applied are: (i) protonation of the alkene to generate the more substituted carbocation (Markovnikov rule), (ii) possible 1,2-rearrangements to form a more stable carbocation (Wagner–Meerwein rearrangement), (iii) nucleophilic attack of water on the carbocation, and (iv) deprotonation to give the neutral alcohol.\n\nFor 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene, $CH_2=CH-C(CH_3)_3$, protonation of the double bond occurs preferentially at the terminal carbon to place the positive charge at the internal carbon, giving a secondary carbocation at the position adjacent to the quaternary carbon. This secondary carbocation is less stable than a possible tertiary carbocation obtainable by rearrangement. Because the cationic center is adjacent to a quaternary carbon bearing methyl groups, a 1,2-methyl shift from that adjacent carbon to the cationic center occurs, converting the secondary carbocation into a more stable tertiary carbocation (Wagner–Meerwein rearrangement). Water then attacks the tertiary carbocation to give an oxonium ion, and subsequent deprotonation affords the neutral alcohol.\n\nThe site of positive charge after rearrangement is the carbon originally labeled C3 (which becomes part of the new backbone), so the hydroxyl group ends up at the rearranged carbocation center. The rearranged carbocation is $(CH_3)_2C^+-CH(CH_3)_2$. The product is $(CH_3)_2C(OH)-CH(CH_3)_2$. The longest continuous chain contains four carbons; numbering to give the hydroxyl the lowest possible locant places the OH at carbon 2, with methyl substituents at carbons 2 and 3. The correct IUPAC name is therefore 2,3-dimethyl-2-butanol, which corresponds to option B.\n\nThus, the major product is the rearranged, more stable tertiary alcohol: 2,3-dimethyl-2-butanol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2152142"}, {"introduction": "A true mastery of reaction mechanisms requires understanding the principles that underlie the \"rules.\" Our model of carbocation stability must extend beyond simply counting alkyl substituents to include powerful electronic effects. This problem [@problem_id:2152119] presents a fascinating comparison, contrasting a standard Markovnikov hydration with a case where a strongly electron-withdrawing group destabilizes a nearby positive charge. This forces you to analyze the underlying electronic forces and correctly predict a regiochemical outcome that appears to be an exception to the general rule.", "problem": "Consider two separate reactions involving the acid-catalyzed hydration of two different alkenes in dilute aqueous sulfuric acid.

The regiochemistry is governed by the relative stabilities of the possible carbocation intermediates; in the absence of special effects, this yields the Markovnikov product because more substituted carbocations are more stable.\n\nFor propene, $CH_3-CH=CH_2$, protonation at the terminal carbon $C_1$ gives a secondary carbocation at $C_2$, which is more stable than the primary alternative. Subsequent attack by water at $C_2$ and deprotonation yields propan-2-ol. Thus, propene gives propan-2-ol.\n\nFor 3,3,3-trifluoropropene, the structure is $CF_3-CH=CH_2$. Consider the two possible carbocations from protonation:\n- Protonation at $C_1$ (terminal $CH_2$) would place the positive charge at $C_2$ (secondary), but this carbocation is adjacent to the $CF_3$ group. The $CF_3$ group exerts a strong $-I$ inductive effect, which strongly destabilizes a nearby carbocation.\n- Protonation at $C_2$ would place the positive charge at $C_1$ (primary), which, although less substituted, is farther from the $CF_3$ group and therefore less destabilized.\n\nBecause the $-I$ effect of $CF_3$ greatly destabilizes the adjacent secondary carbocation, the pathway leading to the primary carbocation at $C_1$ is favored. Water then attacks $C_1$, and after deprotonation, the product is $HO-CH_2-CH_2-CF_3$, namely 3,3,3-trifluoropropan-1-ol. Hence, the first reaction yields propan-2-ol, and the second yields 3,3,3-trifluoropropan-1-ol.\n\nTherefore, the correct pair corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2152119"}]}
