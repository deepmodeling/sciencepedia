{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "While the reaction of an alkene with a halogen like $Br_2$ is a classic example of electrophilic addition, the outcome changes significantly when performed in a nucleophilic solvent. This exercise [@problem_id:2173972] challenges you to predict the major product by considering how the solvent competes with the bromide ion as a nucleophile. You'll need to apply principles of regioselectivity, similar to Markovnikov's rule, to determine where the solvent attacks the bridged bromonium ion intermediate.", "problem": "An organic chemistry student investigates the reactivity of alkenes. In an experiment, 2-methyl-2-butene is dissolved in ethanol. To this solution, an equimolar amount of bromine ($Br_2$) is added, and the reaction is allowed to proceed to completion. This reaction is known to form a major organic product resulting from the incorporation of both a bromine atom and a fragment from the solvent molecule.\n\nSelect the correct International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name for the major organic product formed in this reaction.\n\nA. 3-bromo-2-ethoxy-2-methylbutane\n\nB. 2-bromo-3-ethoxy-2-methylbutane\n\nC. 2,3-dibromo-2-methylbutane\n\nD. 1-bromo-2-ethoxy-2-methylbutane\n\nE. 2-bromo-2-ethoxy-3-methylbutane", "solution": "The alkene is 2-methyl-2-butene, which can be represented as CH3-C(CH3)=CH-CH3. When $Br_{2}$ is added in a nucleophilic solvent such as ethanol, the reaction proceeds via the halonium ion mechanism:\n1) The alkene reacts with $Br_{2}$ to form a cyclic bromonium ion across the double bond. This step is an electrophilic addition.\n2) The solvent ethanol acts as the nucleophile and opens the bromonium ion by attacking the more substituted carbon (Markovnikov orientation), because in the bridged intermediate the more substituted carbon bears greater partial positive character.\n3) Deprotonation of the oxonium intermediate by a base (ethanol or bromide) furnishes the anti addition product bearing a bromine atom on the less substituted carbon and an ethoxy group on the more substituted carbon.\n\nApplying this to 2-methyl-2-butene, the more substituted alkene carbon is C2 (tertiary), and the less substituted is C3 (secondary). Therefore, ethanol adds at C2 and bromine at C3, giving the skeleton CH3-C(EtO)(CH3)-CH(Br)-CH3.\n\nFor IUPAC naming:\n- The parent chain is butane.\n- Substituents are ethoxy and methyl at C2, and bromo at C3 if we number from the end that gives the lowest set of locants.\n- Compare numbering sets: left-to-right gives locants {2-ethoxy, 2-methyl, 3-bromo} which is the set {2,2,3}; right-to-left gives {3-ethoxy, 3-methyl, 2-bromo} which is {2,3,3}. The set {2,2,3} is preferred.\n- List substituents in alphabetical order: bromo, ethoxy, methyl.\n\nThus, the correct IUPAC name is 3-bromo-2-ethoxy-2-methylbutane, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2173972"}, {"introduction": "Halogenation reactions are renowned for their stereochemical precision; they are stereospecific, meaning the geometry of the starting alkene directly dictates the stereochemistry of the product. This precision arises from the anti-addition mechanism, where the two halogen atoms add to opposite faces of the original double bond. In this practice [@problem_id:2173982], you will apply this rule to a (Z)-alkene to determine the exact stereochemical nature of the product mixture, solidifying your understanding of this fundamental principle.", "problem": "Consider the reaction of (Z)-3-methylpent-2-ene with molecular bromine ($Br_2$) in carbon tetrachloride ($CCl_4$), which serves as a non-participating solvent. The reaction proceeds to completion via the standard electrophilic addition mechanism. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate stereochemical description of the resulting organic product or product mixture?\n\nA. A single achiral meso compound.\n\nB. A racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n\nC. A pair of diastereomers formed in unequal amounts.\n\nD. A single, optically active chiral compound.\n\nE. An equimolar mixture of two diastereomers.", "solution": "Identify the alkene structure and its geometry: the substrate is 3-methylpent-2-ene, which can be written as CH3–CH= C(CH3)–CH2–CH3. Assigning CIP priorities on the double bond, at carbon $C_{2}$ the higher priority group is the methyl substituent (over hydrogen), and at carbon $C_{3}$ the higher priority group is the ethyl substituent (over methyl). The designation $(Z)$ therefore means that the methyl group at $C_{2}$ and the ethyl group at $C_{3}$ lie on the same side of the double bond.\n\nBromination with $Br_{2}$ in $CCl_{4}$ proceeds via a bromonium ion intermediate followed by nucleophilic opening by $Br^{-}$ with overall anti addition. This mechanism is stereospecific: the two new C–Br bonds are formed anti across the original double bond.\n\nApply the stereospecific anti addition to a $(Z)$-alkene. Starting from a planar alkene, approach of $Br_{2}$ from either face generates enantiomeric bromonium ions, and subsequent backside attack by $Br^{-}$ gives enantiomeric vicinal dibromides. Because the reagents and solvent are achiral and non-participating, both faces are accessed equally, yielding an enantiomeric pair in equal amounts.\n\nDetermine the product’s constitution and chirality. Addition across $C_{2}=C_{3}$ furnishes 2,3-dibromo-3-methylpentane, in which both $C_{2}$ and $C_{3}$ are stereogenic centers. The substituent sets at $C_{2}$ (hydrogen and methyl) and at $C_{3}$ (methyl and ethyl) are not identical, so no internal mirror plane is possible; a meso form cannot arise. Since the anti addition fixes a single relative configuration, only one pair of enantiomers is formed, not diastereomers.\n\nTherefore, the stereochemical outcome is a racemic mixture of enantiomers.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2173982"}, {"introduction": "A key skill for an organic chemist is not just predicting reaction outcomes, but also designing syntheses to create specific molecules with precise stereochemistry. This problem [@problem_id:2173974] flips the script, asking you to work backward from a target product—a meso compound—to the required starting material.

(E)-Hex-2-ene\n\nB. (Z)-Hex-3-ene\n\nC. Hex-1-ene\n\nD. (Z)-Hex-2-ene\n\nE. (E)-Hex-3-ene", "solution": "The target is meso-3,4-dichlorohexane, which has chlorines at C3 and C4. Therefore, the alkene precursor must place the double bond between C3 and C4 so that addition of $Cl_{2}$ installs chlorine at those positions. This immediately eliminates any alkene that does not have the double bond at C3–C4:\n- Hex-1-ene gives 1,2-dichlorohexane, not 3,4-dichlorohexane.\n- Hex-2-ene (either $(E)$ or $(Z)$) gives 2,3-dichlorohexane, not 3,4-dichlorohexane.\nThus the only viable skeletons are $(E)$-hex-3-ene and $(Z)$-hex-3-ene.\n\nAddition of $Cl_{2}$ to an alkene proceeds via a bridged chloronium ion intermediate followed by backside attack by $Cl^{-}$, which enforces anti addition. The stereochemical consequence for a symmetric internal alkene that yields two adjacent stereocenters is:\n- Anti addition to the $(E)$ (trans) alkene produces the meso dihalide (the two new stereocenters have opposite configurations, $R,S$, and the molecule has an internal mirror plane because the ends are identical $(\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2-)$).\n- Anti addition to the $(Z)$ (cis) alkene produces a racemic mixture of enantiomers ($R,R$ and $S,S$), not the meso compound.\n\nSince we require exclusive formation of meso-3,4-dichlorohexane, the correct precursor is $(E)$-hex-3-ene.\n\nAmong the options, that is choice E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2173974"}]}
