For non-cyclic alkynes, the general molecular formula is $C_nH_{2n-2}$. One such alkyne is octyne, which has the molecular formula $C_8H_{14}$. When an alkyne undergoes complete catalytic hydrogenation, using hydrogen gas ($H_2$) in the presence of a metal catalyst such as palladium (Pd), the triple bond is fully saturated and converted into a single bond, resulting in the formation of the corresponding alkane.\n\nConsider all possible unique structural isomers of non-cyclic octynes.

Therefore, an octyne that hydrogenates to 3-methylheptane must have exactly the same carbon connectivity as 3-methylheptane, with one of its carbon–carbon single bonds being the triple bond in the alkyne precursor.\n\nLet the carbon skeleton of 3-methylheptane be the heptane chain $C_{1}-C_{2}-C_{3}-C_{4}-C_{5}-C_{6}-C_{7}$ with a methyl substituent $C_{8}$ on $C_{3}$.

In the carbon skeleton graph, this means each endpoint of the chosen bond must have carbon–carbon degree at most $2$. In 3-methylheptane, the carbon degrees (counting only carbon neighbors) are:\n$$\\deg(C_{1})=1,\\ \\deg(C_{2})=2,\\ \\deg(C_{3})=3,\\ \\deg(C_{4})=2,\\ \\deg(C_{5})=2,\\ \\deg(C_{6})=2,\\ \\deg(C_{7})=1,\\ \\deg(C_{8})=1.$$\nHence any bond incident to $C_{3}$ (the unique degree-$3$ carbon) cannot be a triple bond in a valid alkyne. The total number of carbon–carbon bonds is $E=7$, and the number of bonds incident to $C_{3}$ is $3$ (namely $(2\\text{--}3)$, $(3\\text{--}4)$, $(3\\text{--}8)$).

Each yields a distinct positional isomer because the skeleton has no nontrivial automorphism (there is a single degree-$3$ vertex $C_{3}$, and the two sides of the chain from $C_{3}$ have different lengths), so no two of these bonds are symmetry-equivalent.\n\nTherefore, there are $4$ unique non-cyclic octyne isomers that hydrogenate to 3-methylheptane as the sole product.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "2158728"}]}
