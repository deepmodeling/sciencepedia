We need to analyze each step to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of propyne with ethylmagnesium bromide**\n\nThe first step involves reacting propyne ($CH_3-C \\equiv C-H$) with ethylmagnesium bromide ($CH_3CH_2MgBr$). Ethylmagnesium bromide is a Grignard reagent, which is a source of the strongly basic ethyl carbanion ($CH_3CH_2^−$). Propyne is a terminal alkyne, meaning it has a hydrogen atom attached to one of the sp-hybridized carbons. This terminal proton is acidic (with a $pK_a \\approx 25$) due to the high s-character of the sp orbital, which stabilizes the resulting conjugate base.\n\nThe ethyl carbanion is a much stronger base than the propyn-1-ide anion. The conjugate acid of the ethyl anion is ethane ($CH_3CH_3$), which has a $pK_a \\approx 50$. Therefore, a highly favorable acid-base reaction occurs where the ethyl group from the Grignard reagent deprotonates the terminal alkyne.\n\nThe reaction is as follows:\n$$ CH_3-C \\equiv C-H + CH_3CH_2-MgBr \\longrightarrow CH_3-C \\equiv C:^-MgBr^+ + CH_3-CH_3 $$\nThis reaction produces a magnesium acetylide salt (propyn-1-ylmagnesium bromide) and ethane gas. The key species formed for the next step is the propyn-1-ide anion ($CH_3-C \\equiv C:^-$), which is a strong nucleophile.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of the acetylide with 1-bromoethane**\n\nIn the second step, 1-bromoethane ($CH_3CH_2Br$) is added to the reaction mixture containing the newly formed propyn-1-ide anion. The acetylide anion acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon of 1-bromoethane. The carbon atom bonded to the bromine is electron-deficient due to the electronegativity of the bromine atom.\n\nThis reaction proceeds via a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution ($\\mathrm{S_N}2$) mechanism. 1-bromoethane is a primary alkyl halide, which is very susceptible to $\\mathrm{S_N}2$ reactions because the reaction site is not sterically hindered. The nucleophilic acetylide anion attacks the carbon atom bearing the bromine, and the bromide ion ($Br^-$) is displaced as the leaving group. This process forms a new carbon-carbon single bond.\n\nThe reaction is as follows:\n$$ CH_3-C \\equiv C:^- + CH_3CH_2-Br \\longrightarrow CH_3-C \\equiv C-CH_2CH_3 + Br^- $$\nThe spectator ion $MgBr^+$ combines with the leaving group $Br^-$ to form magnesium bromide ($\\text{MgBr}_2$).\n\n**Identifying the Final Product and its IUPAC Name**\n\nThe major organic product of this sequence is $CH_3-C \\equiv C-CH_2CH_3$.\n\nTo name this compound according to IUPAC rules:\n1. Find the longest continuous carbon chain that includes the triple bond. The chain has five carbon atoms, so the parent name is \"pentyne\".\n2. Number the chain from the end that gives the triple bond the lowest possible locant (position number).\n    - Numbering from left to right: $\\overset{1}{C}H_3-\\overset{2}{C}\\equiv\\overset{3}{C}-\\overset{4}{C}H_2-\\overset{5}{C}H_3$. The triple bond starts at carbon 2.\n    - Numbering from right to left: $\\overset{5}{C}H_3-\\overset{4}{C}\\equiv\\overset{3}{C}-\\overset{2}{C}H_2-\\overset{1}{C}H_3$. The triple bond starts at carbon 3.\nThe lowest number is 2, so the correct locant for the triple bond is 2.\n3. The IUPAC name is therefore pent-2-yne.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA. Hept-3-yne: Incorrect. This would result from adding two ethyl groups from both reagents to an ethyne core, or adding the ethyl groups to each other and the propyne.\nB. Pent-1-yne: Incorrect. This would require the triple bond to remain at the terminal position, which does not happen during this alkylation.\nC. Pent-2-yne: Correct.\nD. 3-Methylbut-1-yne: Incorrect. This is a structural isomer and would require a branched alkyl halide or rearrangement.\nE. Pentane: Incorrect. This would be the product of a complete reduction (hydrogenation), not alkylation.\n\nThus, the major organic product is pent-2-yne.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2154002"}, {"introduction": "Real-world synthesis often involves molecules with multiple reactive sites, demanding careful control to achieve the desired product.

The reagent sodium acetylide provides the acetylide anion, which is a strong base and a strong nucleophile.\n\nIn an aprotic solvent, primary alkyl halides react with acetylide anions predominantly via bimolecular nucleophilic substitution, denoted $\\mathrm{S_N}2$. Both halides in the substrate are primary, so the site selectivity is governed by leaving group ability. The leaving group ability follows the well-established order $I^- > Br^- > Cl^-$. Therefore, the acetylide anion will react faster at the carbon bearing bromine than at the carbon bearing chlorine.\n\nWith exactly one molar equivalent of sodium acetylide, a single $\\mathrm{S_N}2$ displacement occurs at the carbon bearing bromine, forming the carbon-carbon bond between the terminal acetylide carbon and the methylene carbon that originally bore bromine, while the chloride remains unreacted. This yields the product $HC\\equiv C–CH_2–CH_2–CH_2–Cl$, which is 5-chloro-1-pentyne.\n\nCompeting elimination is minimal for a primary alkyl bromide under these conditions, and double substitution to give a diyne would require two equivalents of acetylide; thus, with exactly one equivalent, the major product is the monoalkylated chloroalkyne.\n\nHence, the correct choice is 5-chloro-1-pentyne.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2154005"}, {"introduction": "A key aspect of mastering organic synthesis is not just knowing which reactions to use, but also recognizing when a planned reaction might fail due to competing pathways.

The synthesis will yield a mixture containing roughly equal amounts of 6-bromo-2-hexyne and a cyclic product, as the rates of the intermolecular and intramolecular reactions are comparable.", "solution": "The substrate 5-bromo-1-pentyne contains a terminal alkyne (acidic C–H at the terminal carbon) and a primary alkyl bromide three methylenes away. Treatment with sodium amide in liquid ammonia first establishes a fast Brønsted acid–base equilibrium that generates the acetylide anion. This step is favored because the conjugate acid of the base is ammonia with $pK_a$ much larger than that of a terminal alkyne.

It is tethered intramolecularly to a primary bromide through a three-methylene chain, which is geometrically predisposed for a 5-exo-tet intramolecular $\\mathrm{S_N}2$ closure. Intramolecular reactions benefit from high effective molarity.

This directly contradicts the premise in option A and the comparability implied in option E.\n\nThe intramolecular $\\mathrm{S_N}2$ event forms a five-membered ring containing the original alkyne functionality within the ring framework. Although very small-ring cycloalkynes are highly strained, the key outcome here is that the intramolecular substitution is rapid and consumes the acetylide before significant intermolecular methylation can occur, furnishing a cyclic product as the major outcome under these conditions. This shows the desired intermolecular alkylation to 6-bromo-2-hexyne will not occur in significant yield. Furthermore, option D is incorrect because acetylide anions are strong nucleophiles that readily perform $\\mathrm{S_N}2$ on methyl iodide in the absence of faster intramolecular competitors.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that a rapid intramolecular nucleophilic substitution occurs to give a cyclic product as the major product, thwarting the intended synthesis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2153990"}]}
