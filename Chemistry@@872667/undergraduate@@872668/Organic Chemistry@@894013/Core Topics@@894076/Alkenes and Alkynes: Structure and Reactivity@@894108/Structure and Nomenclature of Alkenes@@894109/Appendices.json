A cornerstone of this system is the rule of identifying the longest continuous carbon chain that contains the principal functional group. This exercise [@problem_id:2203971] challenges you to apply this fundamental rule to correct a common naming error, training you to look beyond the most obvious linear chain to find the true parent structure.", "problem": "An undergraduate student is synthesizing a series of branched alkenes. In their lab notebook, they propose the name \"4-propyl-2-hexene\" for one of their target products. However, upon review, a senior chemist points out that this name is incorrect because it does not follow the systematic naming rules established by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).\n\nAssuming the student drew the intended molecular structure correctly based on their proposed name, what is the correct IUPAC name for this compound?\n\nA. 4-propyl-2-hexene\n\nB. 4-ethyl-2-heptene\n\nC. 3-ethyl-4-heptene\n\nD. 4-propyl-3-hexene\n\nE. 5-propyl-4-heptene", "solution": "Interpret the student’s proposed name as the intended structure: a hexene backbone with the double bond between C2 and C3, and an n-propyl substituent at C4. Represent the connectivity as a six-carbon chain $1$-$2{= }3$-$4$-$5$-$6$ with a three-carbon branch attached at C4.\n\nApply IUPAC rules:\n- The parent chain must be the longest chain containing the double bond. Tracing from C1 through the double bond and then through the branch gives a seven-carbon chain: $1$-$2{= }3$-$4$-$a$-$b$-$c$, where $a$-$b$-$c$ are the propyl carbons attached to C4. This yields a heptene parent rather than a hexene.\n- Number the parent chain to give the double bond the lowest possible locant. Numbering from the end that places the double bond at C2 gives hept-2-ene; the reverse direction would give hept-5-ene, which is not preferred.\n- Identify substituents not included in the parent chain. The two-carbon fragment $5$-$6$ (from the original hexyl chain beyond C4) becomes an ethyl substituent attached at carbon 4 of the hept-2-ene chain.\n\nThus, the correct IUPAC name is 4-ethyl-2-heptene, corresponding to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2203971"}, {"introduction": "Building on the principle of the longest parent chain, the next critical step in IUPAC nomenclature is numbering the chain correctly.

Identify the longest chain containing the maximum number of double bonds; this gives a seven-carbon chain (hepta-) with two double bonds.\n\nNumber the chain from the end that gives the lowest possible locants to the multiple bonds. Numbering left-to-right yields double bonds at positions $2$ and $5$ (i.e., hepta-$2,5$-diene). Numbering right-to-left also yields double bonds at $2$ and $5$, so there is a tie at this stage.\n\nApply the next IUPAC tiebreaker: assign the lowest set of locants to the substituents. With left-to-right numbering, the methyl substituents are at C$3$ and C$4$ (i.e., $3,4$-dimethyl). With right-to-left numbering, they would be at C$4$ and C$5$ (i.e., $4,5$-dimethyl). Since $\\{3,4\\}$ is lower than $\\{4,5\\}$, choose the left-to-right numbering.\n\nThus, the correct parent name is hepta-$2,5$-diene with substituents at C$3$ and C$4$, giving 3,4-dimethylhepta-2,5-diene.\n\nStereochemical descriptors (E/Z) are not specified by the condensed formula provided; therefore, including such descriptors is not justified.

Therefore, Compound X must be a diene embedded in the bicyclo[2.2.2]octane framework; hydrogenation removes the two double bonds but preserves the bicyclic skeleton, giving bicyclo[2.2.2]octane as a single product.\n\nAmong the options, only names that denote the bicyclo[2.2.2]octane skeleton are candidates: these are bicyclo[2.2.2]octa-2,5-diene and bicyclo[2.2.2]octa-2,7-diene (options B and E). In the highly symmetric bicyclo[2.2.2] framework, these denote the same structural motif of two double bonds in two of the equivalent bridges; by IUPAC rules, numbering is chosen to give the lowest set of locants, making 2,5 preferred over 2,7.
