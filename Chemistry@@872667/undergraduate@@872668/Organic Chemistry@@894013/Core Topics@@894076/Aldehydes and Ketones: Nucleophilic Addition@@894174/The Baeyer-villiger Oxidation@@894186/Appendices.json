The stereocenter is the benzylic carbon $\\text{CH(Ph)}$ adjacent to the carbonyl.\n\nBaeyer-Villiger oxidation of an unsymmetrical ketone $R-CO-R'$ with a peroxyacid inserts an oxygen adjacent to the carbonyl to give an ester. The group with higher migratory aptitude migrates from the carbonyl carbon to the peroxide oxygen, yielding $R-O-CO-R'$, where $R$ is the migrating group.

A shift of the carbonyl band from approximately $1715 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$ to $1680 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$ indicates a lower-frequency carbonyl, more consistent with conjugation or an amide, not an ester; ester formation should shift the band higher, not lower.
