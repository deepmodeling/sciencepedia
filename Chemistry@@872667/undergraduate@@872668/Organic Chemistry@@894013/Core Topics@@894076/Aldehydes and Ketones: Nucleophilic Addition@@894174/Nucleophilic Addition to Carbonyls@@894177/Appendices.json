The IUPAC name indicates a five-carbon chain (pent-) with an aldehyde (`-al`) as the principal functional group (at C1) and a ketone (`oxo-`) at C4.\nStructure of 4-oxopentanal: $\\text{CH}_3\\text{-C(=O)-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-CHO}$\n\nThe target product is 5-hydroxy-2-pentanone.

Aldehydes are generally more reactive than ketones towards nucleophilic attack, including reduction by hydride reagents like sodium borohydride ($\\text{NaBH}_4$).\n\n**Option B:** This sequence attempts a direct reduction of the dicarbonyl compound using $\\text{NaBH}_4$.\n$\\text{CH}_3\\text{-C(=O)-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-CHO}$ --(1. $\\text{NaBH}_4$, $\\text{CH}_3\\text{OH}$; 2. $\\text{H}_3\\text{O}^+$)-- ?\nSince the aldehyde is more reactive, it will be reduced. However, $\\text{NaBH}_4$ is also capable of reducing ketones, albeit more slowly. Without careful control of stoichiometry and temperature (which is not specified), this reaction would likely result in a mixture of products, including the desired product, the starting material, and the fully reduced pentane-1,4-diol ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{-CH(OH)-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{OH}$). Therefore, this is not a clean or reliable method for the selective synthesis required.\n\n**Option C:** This sequence uses a Grignard reagent, $\\text{CH}_3\\text{MgBr}$.\n$\\text{CH}_3\\text{-C(=O)-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-CHO}$ --(1. $\\text{CH}_3\\text{MgBr}$, $\\text{THF}$; 2. $\\text{H}_3\\text{O}^+$)-- ?\nGrignard reagents are strong nucleophiles that add to carbonyls. It would preferentially attack the more reactive aldehyde, adding a methyl group and forming a secondary alcohol upon workup. The product would be 5-hydroxyhexan-2-one ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{-C(=O)-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-CH(OH)-CH}_3$). This is not the target product.\n\n**Option E:** This sequence uses Tollen's reagent.\n$\\text{CH}_3\\text{-C(=O)-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-CHO}$ --(1. $\\text{Ag}_2\\text{O}$, $\\text{NH}_4\\text{OH}$; 2. $\\text{H}_3\\text{O}^+$)-- ?\nTollen's reagent is a mild oxidizing agent that selectively oxidizes aldehydes to carboxylic acids in the presence of ketones. The product would be 4-oxopentanoic acid ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{-C(=O)-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-COOH}$). This is an oxidation, not the required reduction.\n\n**The Protecting Group Strategy (Options A and D)**\n\nTo achieve the desired selectivity, a protecting group strategy is typically employed. The goal is to mask one functional group while the other is transformed.\n\nThe strategy should be:\n1.  **Protect** the ketone selectively.\n2.  **Reduce** the unmasked aldehyde.\n3.  **Deprotect** the ketone to restore it.\n\nEthylene glycol ($\\text{HOCH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$) in the presence of an acid catalyst ($p\\text{-TsOH}$) is used to form a cyclic acetal, a common protecting group for carbonyls. Aldehydes react faster than ketones to form acetals (kinetic control), but the problem implies a successful route is possible. For a textbook problem, the most robust strategy often involves protection/deprotection, assuming the necessary selectivity can be achieved.\n\nLet's analyze the sequences based on this three-step strategy.\n\n**Option A:**\n1.  $\\text{HOCH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$, catalytic $p\\text{-TsOH}$: This step protects a carbonyl group. In a selective synthesis, we would protect the less reactive group (the ketone) to allow the more reactive group (the aldehyde) to be transformed. Assuming selective protection of the ketone is achieved, we form an acetal at the C4 position.\n    Intermediate: $\\text{CH}_3\\text{-C(O-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-O)-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-CHO}$ (The aldehyde is free).\n2.  $\\text{NaBH}_4$ in $\\text{CH}_3\\text{OH}$: This hydride reagent will now reduce the only available carbonyl group, the aldehyde, to a primary alcohol.\n    Intermediate: $\\text{CH}_3\\text{-C(O-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-O)-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{OH}$\n3.  $\\text{H}_3\\text{O}^+$, $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$: Aqueous acid hydrolyzes the acetal, deprotecting it and restoring the ketone.\n    Product: $\\text{CH}_3\\text{-C(=O)-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{OH}$\n\nThis sequence perfectly matches the required strategic logic and yields the correct target product.\n\n**Option D:**\n1.  $\\text{HOCH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$, catalytic $p\\text{-TsOH}$: This step protects a carbonyl.\n    Intermediate: e.g., $\\text{CH}_3\\text{-C(O-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-O)-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-CHO}$\n2.  $\\text{H}_3\\text{O}^+$, $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$: This step immediately deprotects the acetal, regenerating the starting material, 4-oxopentanal.\n3.  $\\text{NaBH}_4$ in $\\text{CH}_3\\text{OH}$: This step then attempts to reduce the unprotected starting material, leading to the same non-selective outcome as in Option B.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the sequence in Option A follows the correct synthetic logic of protection, transformation, and deprotection to achieve the desired chemoselective reduction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2185734"}]}
