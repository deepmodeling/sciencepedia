Phenylacetic acid\n\nD. 3-phenylpropanal\n\nE. 3-phenylpropanoic acid", "solution": "The starting material is 3-phenylpropanal. Let's first determine its structure. The parent chain is \"propanal,\" which is a three-carbon aldehyde. The suffix \"-al\" indicates an aldehyde group ($-CHO$), which is by definition at position 1. The name \"3-phenyl\" indicates a phenyl group ($-C_6H_5$) attached to carbon 3. Therefore, the structure of 3-phenylpropanal is:\n\n$C_6H_5 - CH_2 - CH_2 - CHO$\n\nThe problem states that this compound undergoes a reaction under mild oxidizing conditions. In organic chemistry, the mild oxidation of an aldehyde is a classic transformation that converts the aldehyde functional group into a carboxylic acid functional group. The aldehyde group ($-CHO$) is oxidized to a carboxylic acid group ($-COOH$). Mild oxidizing conditions are specifically chosen to be selective for the aldehyde group, leaving other parts of the molecule, such as the alkyl chain and the aromatic phenyl ring, unchanged.\n\nSo, the reaction is:\n$C_6H_5 - CH_2 - CH_2 - CHO \\xrightarrow{\\text{mild oxidation}} C_6H_5 - CH_2 - CH_2 - COOH$\n\nNow, we need to determine the IUPAC name for the product, $C_6H_5 - CH_2 - CH_2 - COOH$.\n1.  **Identify the principal functional group:** The highest priority functional group is the carboxylic acid ($-COOH$).\n2.  **Identify the parent chain:** The longest continuous carbon chain that includes the carboxylic acid carbon is three carbons long. The parent alkane is propane.\n3.  **Name the parent acid:** For a carboxylic acid, the \"-e\" from the parent alkane name is replaced with \"-oic acid\". Thus, the parent acid name is \"propanoic acid\".\n4.  **Number the parent chain:** Numbering starts from the carboxylic acid carbon as C1.\n    $C_6H_5 - \\underset{3}{C}H_2 - \\underset{2}{C}H_2 - \\underset{1}{C}OOH$\n5.  **Identify and name substituents:** There is a phenyl group ($-C_6H_5$) attached to carbon 3.\n6.  **Assemble the full name:** The substituent name and its position are placed before the parent acid name. This gives \"3-phenylpropanoic acid\".\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. 2-phenylpropanoic acid: This would be the product if the phenyl group were on C2.\nB. 3-phenylbenzoic acid: This name is incorrect as the parent chain is an aliphatic acid (propanoic acid), not benzoic acid.\nC. Phenylacetic acid: This is the common name for 2-phenylethanoic acid, which has a two-carbon chain, not three.\nD. 3-phenylpropanal: This is the name of the starting material, not the product.\nE. 3-phenylpropanoic acid: This matches our derived name for the product.\n\nTherefore, the correct IUPAC name for the major organic product is 3-phenylpropanoic acid.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2186837"}, {"introduction": "Beyond knowing what reaction occurs, a practical chemist must also determine *how much* reactant is needed.
