This reaction results in the nucleophilic addition of the cyanide anion to the carbonyl carbon, followed by protonation, to form a stable organic product. Your task is to provide the systematic International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name for this major organic product.", "solution": "The reaction described is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone. The reactants are cyclopentanone and hydrogen cyanide (HCN).\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and the nature of the reaction.**\nThe reactants are cyclopentanone, a five-membered cyclic ketone, and hydrogen cyanide. The reaction is a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group. The base catalyst (e.g., $CN^-$ from NaCN or KCN, which is often used as the source of HCN in situ) deprotonates HCN to generate the cyanide anion ($CN^-$), a potent nucleophile.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the mechanism and structure of the product.**\nThe cyanide anion ($CN^-$) acts as the nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon atom of the carbonyl group in cyclopentanone. The $\\pi$-bond of the carbonyl group breaks, and the electrons move to the oxygen atom, creating a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\nThis intermediate is an anion: an oxygen atom with a negative charge attached to a cyclopentane ring, where the same carbon atom is also bonded to a cyano group (-CN).\nIn the second step, this alkoxide intermediate is protonated by a proton source, which is HCN in this case (or water if present), to yield the final neutral product.\nThe resulting product has a cyclopentane ring where one carbon atom is bonded to both a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a cyano or nitrile group (-CN).\n\n**Step 3: Apply IUPAC nomenclature rules to name the product.**\nTo determine the IUPAC name, we must identify the principal functional group, the parent hydrocarbon structure, and any substituents.\n\n**3a. Identify the principal functional group.**\nThe product contains two functional groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a nitrile group (-CN). According to IUPAC priority rules, the nitrile group has higher priority than the hydroxyl group. Therefore, the suffix of the name will be determined by the nitrile group.\n\n**3b. Determine the parent structure and suffix.**\nWhen a -CN group is attached directly to a cyclic system, the suffix \"-carbonitrile\" is appended to the name of the ring system. The parent ring is cyclopentane. Thus, the parent name is cyclopentanecarbonitrile.\n\n**3c. Number the parent chain (the ring).**\nThe carbon atom of the ring to which the principal functional group (-carbonitrile) is attached is designated as carbon 1.\n\n**3d. Identify and name the substituents.**\nThe hydroxyl group (-OH) is located on carbon 1. Since it is treated as a substituent (due to the higher priority of the nitrile group), its prefix is \"hydroxy\".\n\n**3e. Assemble the complete IUPAC name.**\nCombining the pieces: the substituent at position 1 is \"1-hydroxy\", and the parent structure is \"cyclopentanecarbonitrile\". Therefore, the full systematic IUPAC name for the product is 1-hydroxycyclopentanecarbonitrile.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\text{1-hydroxycyclopentanecarbonitrile}}$$", "id": "2165312"}, {"introduction": "Moving from pen-and-paper predictions to laboratory verification, how do chemists confirm a reaction has successfully occurred? This problem puts you in the shoes of a chemist using infrared (IR) spectroscopy to monitor a reaction in real time [@problem_id:2165293].

The seeds contain amygdalin, a compound which, upon enzymatic hydrolysis, releases benzaldehyde, glucose, and hydrogen cyanide (HCN). The chemist prepares a slightly basic aqueous extract from the seeds and records a baseline Infrared (IR) spectrum, which clearly shows the characteristic absorptions of an aromatic aldehyde. The chemist hypothesizes that benzaldehyde and HCN, both present in the extract, will slowly react to form mandelonitrile, the corresponding cyanohydrin.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, the chemist seals the sample and allows it to sit at room temperature for 24 hours before acquiring a second IR spectrum. Assuming the reaction from benzaldehyde to mandelonitrile proceeds as hypothesized, which of the following pairs of new, characteristic stretching absorption bands would provide the strongest evidence for the formation of mandelonitrile, distinguishing it from the initial starting materials?
