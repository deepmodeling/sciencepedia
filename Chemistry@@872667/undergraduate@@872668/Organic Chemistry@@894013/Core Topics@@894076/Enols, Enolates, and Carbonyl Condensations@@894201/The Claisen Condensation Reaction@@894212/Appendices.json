Ethoxide is both base and leaving group, so ethyl esters are appropriate to avoid transesterification. After C–C bond formation and ethoxide expulsion, the resulting $\\beta$-keto ester enolate is deprotonated under the basic conditions; the acidic workup reprotonates to give the neutral $\\beta$-keto ester.\n- In a mixed Claisen between two esters that both have $\\alpha$-hydrogens, each ester can serve as the nucleophilic enolate donor or as the electrophilic ester acceptor. This leads to four possible $\\beta$-keto esters.\n- Structural mapping rule: the electrophile determines the ketone acyl fragment, and the donor enolate determines the substituent (if any) on the methylene/methine carbon between the two carbonyls.\n\nIdentify donors and electrophiles:\n- Ethyl acetate, $\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{COOEt}$:\n  - Donor enolate: $\\text{}^{-}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{COOEt}$; the $\\alpha$-carbon has no alkyl substituent, so the central carbon in the product is $\\text{CH}_{2}$.\n  - As electrophile, it contributes an acetyl ketone fragment $-\\text{COCH}_{3}$.\n- Ethyl propanoate, $\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{COOEt}$:\n  - Donor enolate: $\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{CH}^{-}\\text{COOEt}$; the $\\alpha$-carbon bears a $\\text{CH}_{3}$ substituent, so the central carbon in the product is $\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_{3})$.\n  - As electrophile, it contributes a propionyl ketone fragment $-\\text{COCH}_{2}\\text{CH}_{3}$.\n\nEnumerate the four Claisen products:\n- Donor ethyl acetate enolate + electrophile ethyl acetate gives $\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{COCH}_{2}\\text{COOEt}$, which is ethyl 3-oxobutanoate (A).\n- Donor ethyl acetate enolate + electrophile ethyl propanoate gives $\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{COCH}_{2}\\text{COOEt}$, which is ethyl 3-oxopentanoate (C).\n- Donor ethyl propanoate enolate + electrophile ethyl acetate gives $\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{COCH}(\\text{CH}_{3})\\text{COOEt}$, which is ethyl 2-methyl-3-oxobutanoate (B).\n- Donor ethyl propanoate enolate + electrophile ethyl propanoate gives $\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{COCH}(\\text{CH}_{3})\\text{COOEt}$, which is ethyl 2-methyl-3-oxopentanoate (D).\n\nAssessment of remaining options:\n- E (ethyl 2-oxobutanoate) is an $\\alpha$-keto ester, not a Claisen product.\n- F (diethyl propanedioate) is a diester (malonate-type), not a $\\beta$-keto ester from Claisen of these reactants.\n- G (ethyl 3-hydroxybutanoate) is an aldol-type product, not formed under Claisen conditions.\n- H (ethyl 2-ethyl-3-oxobutanoate, $\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{COCH}(\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{CH}_{3})\\text{COOEt}$) would require a donor enolate bearing an ethyl substituent at the $\\alpha$-carbon, which is not available from ethyl acetate or ethyl propanoate; thus it is not formed.\n\nConclusion: The four major products expected are A, B, C, and D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABCD}$$", "id": "2209063"}, {"introduction": "Moving from intermolecular to intramolecular reactions opens up a world of cyclic chemistry, a cornerstone of synthesizing complex natural products and pharmaceuticals.

Ethyl benzoate cannot form an enolate because it has no alpha hydrogens adjacent to its carbonyl. Therefore, in the crossed Claisen condensation, the enolate derived from ethyl acetate acts as the nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of ethyl benzoate, forming a tetrahedral intermediate that collapses with loss of ethoxide to give a beta-keto ester.
