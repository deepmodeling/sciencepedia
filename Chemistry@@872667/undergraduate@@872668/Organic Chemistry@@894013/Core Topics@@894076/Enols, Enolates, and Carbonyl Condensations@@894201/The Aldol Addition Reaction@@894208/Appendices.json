In this type of reaction, an enolate formed from one carbonyl compound attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second, different carbonyl compound.

This enolate then nucleophilically attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second carbonyl compound. For an efficient crossed aldol, the electrophilic partner is typically a carbonyl compound that lacks alpha hydrogens so it cannot form an enolate or undergo self-condensation. In the aldol addition product, the carbonyl of the enolate donor is retained, while the carbonyl of the electrophile becomes the alcohol (giving a beta-hydroxy carbonyl compound).\n\nThe target, 3-hydroxy-3-(furan-2-yl)propanal, is a beta-hydroxy aldehyde. The name “propanal” indicates that the retained carbonyl in the product is an aldehyde with a three-carbon chain. In an aldol product, the retained carbonyl comes from the enolate donor; therefore, the enolate donor must be an aldehyde that, after addition of one new carbon-carbon bond at its alpha carbon, yields a three-carbon aldehyde framework. The simplest and correct enolate donor for this is acetaldehyde, which has alpha hydrogens and forms an enolate. Upon addition to an aldehyde electrophile, it furnishes a beta-hydroxy propanal skeleton. The “3-(furan-2-yl)” substituent at the beta carbon (carbon 3) indicates that the electrophile must be furan-2-carbaldehyde (furfural), whose carbonyl becomes the alcohol-bearing carbon in the product. Crucially, furan-2-carbaldehyde lacks alpha hydrogens because the alpha position is part of the aromatic ring; thus it cannot form an enolate and is well-suited as the electrophile in a crossed aldol.\n\nTherefore, acetaldehyde (enolate donor) plus furan-2-carbaldehyde (electrophile) give 3-hydroxy-3-(furan-2-yl)propanal.\n\nChecking alternatives:\n- Propanal + furan-2-carbaldehyde would yield a beta-hydroxy butanal (four-carbon aldehyde), not propanal.\n- Acetone + furan-2-carbaldehyde would give a beta-hydroxy ketone, not an aldehyde.\n- Acetaldehyde + 2-acetylfuran involves two partners with alpha hydrogens, risking mixtures; moreover, the product would be a beta-hydroxy ketone if 2-acetylfuran is the electrophile or an undesired framework if roles invert.\n- Formaldehyde + 1-(furan-2-yl)ethan-1-one would give a beta-hydroxy ketone (and formaldehyde is the electrophile, not matching the aldehyde product required).\n\nThus, the correct pair is acetaldehyde and furan-2-carbaldehyde.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2207835"}, {"introduction": "The rate and efficiency of an aldol addition are not solely determined by the reaction conditions, but also by the intrinsic reactivity of the carbonyl partners. This practice explores how substituents on an aromatic ring can electronically influence the electrophilicity of an aldehyde's carbonyl carbon. Understanding these substituent effects is vital for predicting relative reaction rates and rationally selecting reagents for synthesis [@problem_id:2207763].", "problem": "An organic chemist is studying the factors that influence the rate of crossed aldol addition reactions. In a series of experiments, acetone is treated with a base to form its enolate, which then acts as a nucleophile. This nucleophile is reacted separately with three different aromatic aldehydes. These aldehydes are: benzaldehyde (Compound I), p-chlorobenzaldehyde (Compound II), and p-tolualdehyde (Compound III). Assuming all other reaction conditions (temperature, concentration, solvent) are identical for the three experiments, arrange the three aldehydes in order of decreasing reactivity toward the acetone enolate.\n\nA) II > I > III\n\nB) III > I > II\n\nC) I > II > III\n\nD) I > III > II\n\nE) III > II > I", "solution": "The problem asks to determine the relative reactivity of three substituted benzaldehydes in a crossed aldol addition reaction where they act as electrophiles. The reactivity in this context is determined by the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon.\n\nStep 1: Identify the roles of the reactants.\nIn this crossed aldol addition, acetone is deprotonated by a base to form a nucleophilic enolate. The aromatic aldehydes (Compounds I, II, and III) serve as the electrophiles. The reaction rate is dependent on how susceptible the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde is to nucleophilic attack.\n\nStep 2: Relate reactivity to electrophilicity.\nThe carbonyl group is polarized, with a partial positive charge ($\\delta+$) on the carbon and a partial negative charge ($\\delta-$) on the oxygen. The rate of nucleophilic attack by the acetone enolate is directly proportional to the magnitude of the partial positive charge on the carbonyl carbon. A larger partial positive charge makes the carbon more electrophilic and increases the reaction rate.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the electronic effects of the substituents on the benzene ring.\nSubstituents on the benzene ring can modify the electron density at the carbonyl carbon through inductive and resonance effects.\n- Electron-donating groups (EDGs) increase the electron density in the aromatic ring and, consequently, at the carbonyl carbon. This reduces the partial positive charge, making the carbonyl less electrophilic and less reactive.\n- Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) decrease the electron density in the aromatic ring and pull electron density away from the carbonyl carbon. This increases the partial positive charge, making the carbonyl more electrophilic and more reactive.\n\nStep 4: Classify the substituents for each compound.\n- **Compound I (Benzaldehyde):** The substituent at the para position is a hydrogen atom (-H). This serves as the baseline or reference for comparing the effects of other groups.\n- **Compound II (p-Chlorobenzaldehyde):** The substituent at the para position is a chloro group (-Cl). Chlorine is highly electronegative, exerting a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect). It also possesses lone pairs that can be donated to the ring via resonance (+R effect). However, for halogens, the inductive effect is dominant. Thus, the chloro group is a net electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the ring in electrophilic aromatic substitution but, importantly for this problem, increases the electrophilicity of the attached carbonyl group.\n- **Compound III (p-Tolualdehyde):** The substituent at the para position is a methyl group (-CH$_{3}$). Alkyl groups are electron-donating through induction (+I effect) and hyperconjugation. This group increases the electron density in the ring and at the carbonyl carbon, reducing its electrophilicity.\n\nStep 5: Establish the order of reactivity.\n- **Compound II (p-chlorobenzaldehyde):** The electron-withdrawing -Cl group makes the carbonyl carbon the most electrophilic of the three. Therefore, it will be the most reactive.\n- **Compound III (p-tolualdehyde):** The electron-donating -CH$_{3}$ group makes the carbonyl carbon the least electrophilic of the three. Therefore, it will be the least reactive.\n- **Compound I (benzaldehyde):** With no strong donating or withdrawing group, its reactivity falls between that of Compound II and Compound III.\n\nBased on this analysis, the order of electrophilicity, and thus reactivity, is p-chlorobenzaldehyde > benzaldehyde > p-tolualdehyde. In terms of the given labels, this is II > I > III.

The $pK_a$ of the alpha-protons of a typical ketone like butan-2-one is approximately 20. The $pK_a$ of ethanol is approximately 16.

The amide ion will act as a powerful nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one to form a stable tetrahedral intermediate.\n\nB. The amide ion will selectively and efficiently deprotonate the alpha-carbon of butan-2-one because ketones are intrinsically more reactive towards bases than alcohols are.\n\nC. The sodium amide and butan-2-one will fail to react because sodium amide is insoluble in ethanol, resulting in a non-reactive heterogeneous slurry.\n\nD. The amide ion will be almost entirely neutralized by the ethanol solvent in a rapid acid-base reaction, primarily yielding ammonia and sodium ethoxide.\n\nE.
