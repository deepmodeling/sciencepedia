The most stable diastereomer is the one in which both bulky substituents are in equatorial positions.\n- In this case, the most stable product has the existing C4-tert-butyl group and the newly added C3-methyl group both occupying equatorial positions.\n- For adjacent substituents on a cyclohexane ring (a 1,2-relationship), the diequatorial arrangement corresponds to a *trans* relationship.
