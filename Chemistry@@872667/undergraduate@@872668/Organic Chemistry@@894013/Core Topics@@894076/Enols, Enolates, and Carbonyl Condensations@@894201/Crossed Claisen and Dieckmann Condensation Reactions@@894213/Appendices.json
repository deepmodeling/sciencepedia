The procedure starts with diethyl adipate, a linear diester with the chemical formula $C_{10}H_{18}O_4$. The chemist treats this starting material with one equivalent of sodium hydride ($NaH$) in an anhydrous solvent. After the initial reaction is complete, the mixture is quenched with a dilute aqueous acid solution ($H_3O^+$).\n\nWhat is the major organic product formed in this two-step sequence?

Sodium hydride ($\\text{NaH}$) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base that deprotonates an $\\alpha$-methylene next to an ester, generating an ester enolate. With one equivalent of $\\text{NaH}$, a single $\\alpha$-enolate is formed:\n$$\\text{EtOOC-}CH^{-}-(CH_{2})_{3}\\text{-COOEt} \\quad \\leftrightarrow \\quad \\text{enolate conjugate base}.$$\n\nThis enolate undergoes an intramolecular Claisen condensation (Dieckmann cyclization). The carbanion at the $\\alpha$-carbon attacks the carbonyl carbon of the distal ester, forming a new $\\text{C-C}$ bond and giving a cyclic tetrahedral intermediate, which then expels ethoxide ($\\text{EtO}^{-}$) to afford a cyclic $\\beta$-keto ester enolate. Protonation upon the $H_{3}O^{+}$ quench furnishes the neutral $\\beta$-keto ester.\n\nTo determine the ring size, let $n$ be the number of methylene units between the two ester carbonyl carbons. For diethyl adipate, $n=4$. In a Dieckmann cyclization, the ring size formed equals $n+1$. Substituting $n=4$ gives a ring size of 5, so the product is a cyclopentane ring bearing at C1 an ethyl ester and at C2 a ketone, i.e., a $\\beta$-keto ester.\n\nThe symmetric starting material ensures the same product regardless of which end is deprotonated. The acidic workup ($H_{3}O^{+}$) serves only to protonate the enolate; no saponification or decarboxylation conditions are present, so the product is not a ketone (such as cyclopentanone) nor the diacid (adipic acid). A six-membered ring is not formed from a 1,6-diester; a 1,7-diester would be required for a ring size of 6.\n\nTherefore, the major product is ethyl 2-oxocyclopentane-1-carboxylate.\n\nAmong the options, this corresponds to:\nA.

The base must match the alkoxy group to avoid transesterification; here $NaOEt$ is matched to ethyl esters in $EtOH$.\n2) In a crossed Claisen, selectivity is maximized when one partner lacks $\\alpha$-hydrogens (cannot form an enolate), serving only as the electrophile, while the other partner is enolizable and serves as the nucleophile.\n3) The electrophilic ester contributes the acyl moiety that becomes the ketone carbonyl in the $\\beta$-keto ester, whereas the enolate donor retains its $-OR$ group and thus contributes the ester moiety of the product.\n4) Therefore, to obtain $PhCO{-}CH_{2}{-}COOEt$, the electrophile must be an ethyl benzoate (no $\\alpha$-H; provides $PhCO{-}$), and the enolate donor must be ethyl acetate (provides $-CH_{2}{-}COOEt$).\n\nMechanistic mapping to the target:\n- Base generation of the enolate from ethyl acetate:\n$$CH_{3}COOEt + NaOEt \\rightleftharpoons CH_{2}COOEt^{-}Na^{+} + EtOH.$$\n- Nucleophilic acyl substitution on ethyl benzoate (which has no $\\alpha$-hydrogens and cannot self-condense):\n$$CH_{2}COOEt^{-} + PhCOOEt \\to \\text{tetrahedral intermediate} \\to PhCO{-}CH_{2}{-}COOEt + EtO^{-}.$$\n- Acid workup neutralizes the enolate/alkoxide to give the neutral $\\beta$-keto ester:\n$$PhCO{-}CH_{2}{-}COOEt \\xrightarrow[\\text{}]{\\text{dilute acid}} PhCO{-}CH_{2}{-}COOEt.$$\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A.
