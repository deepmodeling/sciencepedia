The stepwise reasoning is as follows.\n\n1) Under basic conditions (e.g., hydroxide), acetone undergoes deprotonation at its $\\alpha$-position to generate the enolate. This uses the principle that $\\alpha$-hydrogens of carbonyl compounds are acidic due to resonance stabilization of the resulting enolate.\n\n2) The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of acetone. This is nucleophilic addition to a carbonyl, forming a new C–C bond between the $\\alpha$-carbon of the enolate and the carbonyl carbon of the electrophile. After protonation of the alkoxide, the product of this aldol addition step is the $\\beta$-hydroxy ketone known as 4-hydroxy-4-methylpentan-2-one. This corresponds to option A, but it is the intermediate before dehydration.\n\n3) Upon gentle heating in basic medium, the $\\beta$-hydroxy ketone undergoes base-promoted dehydration (an E1cB-type elimination), in which the hydroxyl group and an adjacent $\\alpha$-hydrogen are removed to form a C=C bond conjugated with the carbonyl (driving force: formation of a conjugated enone). The double bond forms between the $\\alpha$- and $\\beta$-carbons relative to the ketone, yielding the $\\alpha,\\beta$-unsaturated ketone 4-methylpent-3-en-2-one (commonly known as mesityl oxide).\n\n4) Therefore, the major product of the self-aldol condensation of acetone under basic conditions with heat is 4-methylpent-3-en-2-one, which matches option B. Options C, D, and E do not correspond to the correct connectivity and/or functional group expected from acetone self-condensation followed by dehydration; option A is the pre-dehydration aldol addition product, not the final major product under the stated conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2208033"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of self-condensation, this problem explores a more synthetically useful variation: the crossed aldol, or Claisen-Schmidt, reaction. You are asked to predict the outcome when a ketone reacts with an aldehyde that cannot form an enolate itself. This scenario [@problem_id:2208073] highlights the principles of regioselectivity and demonstrates how chemists can direct the reaction pathway to form a single major product.", "problem": "In a synthetic chemistry laboratory, a student investigates the reaction between cyclic ketones and aromatic aldehydes. A solution of cyclohexanone and 4-methoxybenzaldehyde in a 1:1 molar ratio is prepared in ethanol. To this solution, a catalytic amount of aqueous sodium hydroxide is added, and the mixture is gently warmed for a short period.

The mechanistic sequence and product outcome are as follows.\n\nFirst, aqueous sodium hydroxide deprotonates cyclohexanone at an $\\alpha$-position to generate the cyclohexanone enolate. This step is favored because cyclohexanone has acidic $\\alpha$-hydrogens and 4-methoxybenzaldehyde has no $\\alpha$-hydrogens, thus preventing self-aldol reactions of the aldehyde and directing the reaction toward the crossed aldol pathway.\n\nThe cyclohexanone enolate then performs nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl carbon of 4-methoxybenzaldehyde to give a benzylic alkoxide. Protonation of this alkoxide by the protic solvent (ethanol or water) furnishes the aldol addition product, namely the $\\beta$-hydroxyketone corresponding to option A: 2-(hydroxy(4-methoxyphenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\nUnder the given basic conditions with gentle warming, the aldol addition product undergoes base-promoted E1cb dehydration. Deprotonation at the $\\alpha$-position adjacent to the ketone generates an enolate that expels hydroxide from the $\\beta$-position, forming the conjugated $\\alpha,\\beta$-unsaturated ketone. This dehydration is thermodynamically favored due to formation of an enone conjugated with an aryl ring, providing extended conjugation and a substantial driving force. The resulting product is 2-(4-methoxybenzylidene)cyclohexan-1-one, which corresponds to option C.\n\nThe other options are disfavored under the specified conditions. Option A is the initial aldol addition product but is not the major product after warming because dehydration occurs readily with aryl-substituted aldol adducts. Option B, 2,6-bis(4-methoxybenzylidene)cyclohexan-1-one, requires a second condensation at the remaining $\\alpha$-position of cyclohexanone; this typically demands excess aldehyde and more forcing conditions. The stated 1:1 molar ratio and short warming period favor the mono-condensation rather than the bis-condensation. Option D would arise from self-aldol condensation of cyclohexanone; however, in the presence of an aromatic aldehyde lacking $\\alpha$-hydrogens and being more electrophilic, the crossed aldol pathway predominates. Option E lacks the ketone functionality entirely and is not produced by this reaction sequence.\n\nTherefore, the single major organic product formed under the described conditions is 2-(4-methoxybenzylidene)cyclohexan-1-one.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2208073"}, {"introduction": "To truly master a reaction, one must understand its mechanism in fine detail. This advanced practice uses isotopic labeling to probe the step-by-step pathway of a base-catalyzed aldol condensation.

The self-condensation of acetophenone ($C_6H_5COCH_3$) is performed to synthesize its corresponding $\\alpha,\\beta$-unsaturated ketone, dypnone (1,3-diphenylbut-2-en-1-one), which has the structure $C_6H_5C(O)CH=C(C_6H_5)CH_3$.\n\nThe reaction is conducted using acetophenone as the sole organic starting material in a solvent of deuterium oxide ($D_2O$) with sodium deuteroxide ($NaOD$) as the catalyst.

Both the vinylic proton and all protons of the methyl group will be replaced by deuterium.\n\nD. All protons, including the vinylic, methyl, and aromatic protons, will be replaced by deuterium.\n\nE. No protons will be replaced by deuterium; the product will be isotopically identical to the one formed in $H_2O/NaOH$.", "solution": "The key physical and mechanistic principles are:\n- Under basic conditions with $OD^{-}$ in $D_2O$, any proton that can be removed by $OD^{-}$ (i.e., sufficiently acidic) undergoes reversible deprotonation to give an enolate, followed by reprotonation from $D_2O$, leading to complete $H \\rightleftharpoons D$ exchange at those positions.\n- For ketones, the alpha hydrogens (on carbons adjacent to the carbonyl) are sufficiently acidic to be removed by $OD^{-}$, whereas typical vinylic, aromatic, and simple allylic hydrogens are not.\n- The base-catalyzed aldol condensation of acetophenone proceeds via enolate formation, aldol addition, and E1cb dehydration, in which the hydrogen abstracted in the elimination step is an alpha hydrogen to the carbonyl in the aldol adduct.\n\nApply these to the specific reaction:\n1) Before C–C bond formation, acetophenone in $D_2O/NaOD$ undergoes complete exchange at its alpha position. Thus each acetophenone becomes $C_6H_5COCD_3$.\n2) In the aldol step, the enolate of one $C_6H_5COCD_3$ attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second $C_6H_5COCD_3$. This forms a beta-alkoxide (which is protonated by solvent to a beta-OD group) in which:\n   - The carbon alpha to the carbonyl (that will become the alpha carbon of the enone double bond) bears deuteriums due to prior exchange.\n   - The substituent that will become the methyl group at the beta carbon of the enone derives from the methyl at the carbonyl carbon of the electrophile acetophenone; that methyl’s hydrogens have already been fully exchanged to deuterium (it is $\\text{CD}_3$) before C–C bond formation.\n3) Dehydration occurs via E1cb: $OD^{-}$ removes one alpha deuteron to give an enolate, and elimination of $OD^{-}$ from the beta position forms the conjugated enone. The alpha carbon, which initially bore deuterium(s) from exchange, retains one deuteron that becomes the vinylic deuterium in the final enone.\n4) The methyl group on the beta carbon in dypnone is the same methyl from the carbonyl carbon of the electrophile acetophenone and, having undergone complete alpha-deuteration beforehand, remains as $\\text{CD}_3$ in the product. Under these conditions, its hydrogens are not subsequently exchanged back because they are no longer alpha to a carbonyl and are not sufficiently acidic as simple allylic hydrogens in water/$OD^{-}$.\n5) Aromatic hydrogens are not deprotonated by $OD^{-}$ and therefore do not exchange.\n\nConclusion:\n- The vinylic hydrogen at the alpha position to the carbonyl becomes deuterium because that position was fully deuterated prior to and during the E1cb elimination; one deuteron remains as the vinylic D.\n- All three hydrogens of the methyl group on the beta carbon are replaced by deuterium because they originated from an acetophenone methyl group that underwent complete alpha-deuteration before condensation.\n- Aromatic hydrogens remain unchanged.\n\nTherefore, both the vinylic proton and all protons of the methyl group are replaced by deuterium, matching option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2208022"}]}
