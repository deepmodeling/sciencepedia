This first practice focuses on the formation of the kinetic enolate, where reaction rate, not stability, dictates the outcome.

The first step of the proposed synthesis requires the formation of an enolate intermediate by selectively removing a proton from the less substituted alpha-carbon. Which of the following sets of reagents and conditions is most suitable for achieving this specific deprotonation?\n\nA. Sodium ethoxide in ethanol at 25 °C\nB. Potassium tert-butoxide in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at -78 °C\nC. Aqueous sodium hydroxide at 100 °C\nD. Pyridine in dichloromethane at 0 °C", "solution": "The target is the enolate formed by deprotonation at the less substituted alpha-carbon of 2-methylcyclopentanone. This corresponds to kinetic enolate formation, which is governed by rate control rather than thermodynamic stability. The principles for selective kinetic deprotonation are: use a strong, bulky, non-nucleophilic base to abstract the most accessible proton rapidly, employ a polar aprotic solvent to solvate ions without promoting proton exchange, and maintain low temperature to suppress equilibration to the thermodynamic enolate.\n\nEvaluating the options using these criteria: Sodium ethoxide in ethanol is a smaller, less hindered base in a protic solvent and at moderate temperature; the conjugate acid ethanol promotes reversible proton transfers, favoring thermodynamic control rather than selective kinetic deprotonation, so A is unsuitable. Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, bulky, non-nucleophilic base; THF is an aprotic solvent; and low temperature favors kinetic control and suppresses equilibration, so B satisfies the requirements and will preferentially remove the less hindered alpha proton. Aqueous sodium hydroxide at elevated temperature provides a protic medium and high thermal energy that enhance equilibration and side reactions such as aldol processes, favoring thermodynamic rather than kinetic control, so C is unsuitable. Pyridine is a weak base that cannot generate a significant concentration of enolate from a ketone, so D is unsuitable.\n\nTherefore, the conditions that best achieve selective deprotonation at the less substituted alpha-carbon are potassium tert-butoxide in THF at low temperature.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2171913"}, {"introduction": "In contrast to kinetic control, thermodynamic control allows a reaction mixture to reach equilibrium, favoring the formation of the most stable product. This exercise shifts the focus to predicting the outcome when forming the thermodynamically favored enolate, which is typically the more substituted and stable one. By analyzing a reaction sequence involving enolate formation and subsequent alkylation, you will apply the principles of thermodynamic control to determine the structure of the major synthetic product.", "problem": "A synthetic organic chemist aims to perform a regioselective alkylation. The protocol involves a two-step sequence starting with 2-methylcyclopentanone. In the first step, the ketone is treated with one equivalent of sodium hydride (NaH) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF) at room temperature (25 °C), and the reaction is allowed to proceed until the evolution of hydrogen gas ceases. In the second step, an excess of iodomethane ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{I}$) is added to the resulting mixture.\n\nGiven the following potential products, identify the major organic product formed in this reaction sequence.\n\nA. 2,5-dimethylcyclopentanone\nB. 2,2-dimethylcyclopentanone\nC. 1,2-dimethylcyclopentanone\nD. 2-ethyl-5-methylcyclopentanone\nE. 1-methoxy-2-methylcyclopentene", "solution": "The reactive site in 2-methylcyclopentanone is the set of alpha positions adjacent to the carbonyl. Treatment with sodium hydride removes an alpha proton to form the corresponding enolate and releases hydrogen gas; cessation of hydrogen evolution indicates completion of deprotonation. Under these conditions (NaH, anhydrous THF, room temperature), deprotonation occurs under thermodynamic control because the base is strong but not sterically hindered and the temperature allows equilibration. The thermodynamic enolate is the more substituted and more stable enolate, which in this substrate arises from removing the single alpha hydrogen at C2 (the alpha carbon bearing the methyl substituent), providing the more substituted enolate (more substituted alkene character in the O-bound resonance contributor and greater stabilization by alkyl substitution and hyperconjugation).\n\nThe enolate formed from deprotonation at C2 has the carbanion at C2 in the carbon-bound resonance form. Upon addition of excess iodomethane, alkylation proceeds at carbon (C-alkylation) via bimolecular substitution at the enolate carbon because primary alkyl halides preferentially give C-alkylation with enolates in polar aprotic media, whereas O-alkylation is favored by different electrophiles (e.g., sulfonates) and conditions. Therefore, methylation occurs at C2, converting the C2-bearing enolate into the alpha-methylated ketone.\n\nConsequently, the major product is the geminally dimethylated ketone at C2, namely 2,2-dimethylcyclopentanone. Alternatives are disfavored: 2,5-dimethylcyclopentanone would arise from the kinetic enolate (deprotonation at the less substituted alpha carbon) typically formed with bulky bases like LDA at low temperature; O-alkylation to give an enol ether is not favored with MeI under these conditions; and other listed structures are inconsistent with enolate C-alkylation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2171883"}, {"introduction": "The principles of enolate formation must always be considered within the context of a molecule's three-dimensional structure. This final practice presents a scenario where stereochemical constraints override the typical rules of reactivity. By examining a rigid bicyclic ketone, you will explore how Bredt's rule forbids the formation of a double bond at a bridgehead, making enolization impossible and highlighting the critical importance of geometric feasibility in reaction mechanisms.", "problem": "An organic chemist is investigating the reactivity of fenchone, a rigid bicyclic ketone. The structure of fenchone consists of a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane skeleton with a carbonyl group at the C2 position. The bridgehead C1 position bears a methyl group and a single hydrogen atom. The C3 position is a quaternary center bearing two methyl groups.\n\nThe chemist attempts to generate an enolate from fenchone by treating it with a strong, non-nucleophilic base, Lithium Diisopropylamide (LDA), in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at low temperature. Consider the following statement about the expected outcome:\n\n\"Fenchone is readily deprotonated by LDA to form a stable enolate, which can then be trapped by an electrophile.\"\n\nEvaluate this statement and select the option below that provides the most accurate chemical reasoning.\n\nA. The statement is true. The alpha-proton at the C1 bridgehead is acidic due to the inductive effect of the adjacent carbonyl group, and its removal leads to a stable, planar enolate intermediate.\nB. The statement is false. The alpha-proton at the C1 bridgehead cannot be removed because the resulting carbanion would be located at a bridgehead position, which is inherently unstable due to its pyramidal geometry.\nC. The statement is false. The resonance-stabilized enolate cannot form because it would require a carbon-carbon double bond at the C1 bridgehead position, a configuration that is geometrically forbidden in this strained bicyclic system according to Bredt's rule.\nD. The statement is true. Deprotonation occurs, but at one of the methyl groups attached to C3. These protons are more sterically accessible and lead to the formation of a thermodynamically favored exocyclic enolate.\nE. The statement is false. Although the alpha-proton at C1 is acidic, the three methyl groups on the molecule create overwhelming steric hindrance that physically prevents the bulky LDA base from accessing the proton.", "solution": "We analyze enolate formation by deprotonation at an \\alpha-position to a ketone. The general mechanistic step is that a strong base $B^{-}$ removes an \\alpha-hydrogen to give an enolate, which is a resonance hybrid of a carbanion and an oxyanion:\n$$\n\\text{(i)}\\quad R-CO-CHR' \\xrightarrow{B^{-}} R-CO-CR'^{-} \\leftrightarrows R-C(=CR')-O^{-}.\n$$\nFor a valid enolate, the $\\pi$ bond between the carbonyl carbon and the \\alpha-carbon in the resonance form $R-C(=CR')-O^{-}$ must be able to adopt planarity and proper $p$-orbital overlap at both centers. In fenchone (a norbornanone-type framework, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one), the carbonyl is at C2; the \\alpha-carbons are C1 (a bridgehead) and C3 (a quaternary center).\n\nConsider deprotonation at C1. C1 bears a single hydrogen (an \\alpha-hydrogen) and is a bridgehead carbon. If this proton were abstracted, the enolate resonance demands formation of a $\\text{C}1=\\text{C}2$ double bond in the $R-C(=CR')-O^{-}$ representation. However, Bredt's rule dictates that in a small bridged bicyclic system such as bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, a double bond cannot be placed at a bridgehead because the required trigonal planar geometry and $p$-orbital alignment at the bridgehead cannot be achieved. Therefore, the resonance-stabilized enolate that would require a $\\text{C}1=\\text{C}2$ double bond is geometrically forbidden. As a result, LDA does not produce a stable, trappable enolate via deprotonation at C1. This directly contradicts the claim that a stable, planar enolate forms.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it assumes planarity and enolate stabilization at the bridgehead; this is disallowed by Bredt's rule. Option B cites instability due to pyramidal geometry of a bridgehead carbanion; while poor conjugation at a bridgehead is an aspect, the most accurate and standard rationale is the geometric impossibility of the required bridgehead double bond for the enolate resonance structure, i.e., Bredt's rule. Option D is incorrect because C3 is a quaternary \\alpha-carbon with no \\alpha-hydrogens; removing protons from the methyl substituents on C3 yields a carbanion not conjugated to the carbonyl (not an enolate) and is not thermodynamically favored under LDA conditions. Option E is incorrect because steric hindrance by methyl groups is not the governing factor; the prohibition arises from geometric constraints on forming the enolate’s requisite $C=C$ at a bridgehead.\n\nTherefore, the statement that fenchone is readily deprotonated by LDA to give a stable enolate that can be trapped by an electrophile is false for the reason that the resonance-stabilized enolate would require a bridgehead double bond forbidden by Bredt’s rule.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2171869"}]}
