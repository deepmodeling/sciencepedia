This allows for the synthesis of more highly substituted ketones, showcasing the reaction's versatility [@problem_id:2151308].", "problem": "A chemist performs a sequential reaction starting with ethyl acetoacetate. First, the ethyl acetoacetate is treated with a stoichiometric excess of sodium ethoxide in ethanol, followed by the addition of a stoichiometric excess of methyl iodide.

Ethyl acetoacetate is ethyl 3-oxobutanoate, with the methylene between the ketone and ester carbonyls being doubly activated and therefore acidic.\n\nApply the first reagent set. A stoichiometric excess of sodium ethoxide in ethanol fully deprotonates the alpha-methylene to give the enolate. Because both alpha hydrogens are acidic and the base is in excess, after the first alkylation the remaining alpha hydrogen can again be deprotonated to form the enolate a second time.\n\nApply the alkylating agent. Treatment with a stoichiometric excess of methyl iodide under these basic conditions leads first to monoalkylation, and then (because both base and methyl iodide are in excess) to dialkylation at the same alpha carbon. The intermediate after alkylation is thus the dialkylated beta-keto ester, ethyl 2,2-dimethyl-3-oxobutanoate (structure: $\\text{CH}_3\\text{-CO-C(CH}_3)_2\\text{-COOEt}$).\n\nSubject the dialkylated beta-keto ester to hydrolysis and decarboxylation. Heating in dilute aqueous acid hydrolyzes the ester to the corresponding beta-keto acid, which then undergoes decarboxylation. In a beta-keto acid, the carboxyl group derived from the original ester is lost as carbon dioxide, and the resulting enol tautomerizes to the ketone.

The proposed synthetic plan is as follows:\n1.  React ethyl acetoacetate with one equivalent of sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol to form a sodium enolate.\n2.  React the resulting enolate with one equivalent of 2-bromo-2-methylpropane (tert-butyl bromide).\n3.  Subject the product from step 2 to acidic hydrolysis and heat to facilitate decarboxylation, with the goal of obtaining 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanone.\n\nUpon attempting the synthesis, the student finds that the desired product, 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanone, is not formed in any significant yield. Instead, the major organic products are regenerated ethyl acetoacetate and 2-methylpropene.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate chemical reason for the failure of this synthesis?\n\nA. The alpha-protons of ethyl acetoacetate are not sufficiently acidic to be deprotonated by the sodium ethoxide base.\nB. The final decarboxylation step is sterically inhibited by the bulky tert-butyl group, preventing the formation of the target ketone.\nC. The enolate of ethyl acetoacetate preferentially acts as a base rather than a nucleophile towards the tertiary alkyl halide, leading to an elimination reaction instead of the desired substitution.\nD. The hydrolysis of the ester functional group is prevented by the severe steric hindrance of the adjacent tert-butyl group.\nE. The enolate of ethyl acetoacetate is not a strong enough nucleophile to react with any alkyl halide, regardless of its structure.", "solution": "The acetoacetic ester synthesis relies on three mechanistic pillars: (i) generation of a resonance-stabilized enolate from ethyl acetoacetate under matching base (NaOEt/EtOH), (ii) carbon–carbon bond formation by bimolecular nucleophilic substitution at an alkyl halide that must be unhindered (typically methyl or primary, sometimes benzylic or allylic), and (iii) hydrolysis and decarboxylation to furnish the substituted methyl ketone.\n\nStep 1: Deprotonation proceeds as intended. The methylene hydrogens alpha to the two carbonyls in ethyl acetoacetate are sufficiently acidic for deprotonation by ethoxide. The acid–base equilibrium is favorable because the enolate is resonance-stabilized:\n$$\\text{EtO}^{-} + \\text{EtOOC-CH}_{2}\\text{-C(=O)CH}_{3} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{EtOOC-CH}^{-}\\text{-C(=O)CH}_{3} + \\text{EtOH}.$$\nTherefore, statement A is incorrect.\n\nStep 2: The enolate must perform a carbon–carbon bond-forming substitution on the alkyl halide. However, tert-butyl bromide is a tertiary halide, which is intrinsically unreactive in the $\\text{S}_N2$ pathway because backside attack is sterically blocked. Under basic conditions, tertiary halides instead undergo elimination. The enolate, being a reasonably strong base, preferentially abstracts a beta-hydrogen from tert-butyl bromide in an E2 process, while bromide leaves, giving 2-methylpropene. In that step, the enolate is converted to its conjugate acid (the keto/enol of ethyl acetoacetate), regenerating starting ester:\n$$\\text{t-BuBr} + \\text{enolate}^{-} \\longrightarrow \\text{2-methylpropene} + \\text{Br}^{-} + \\text{ethyl acetoacetate}.$$\nThis rationalizes the observation of 2-methylpropene and recovered ethyl acetoacetate. Because no C-alkylation occurs, the key carbon–carbon bond is never formed. This directly supports statement C and rules out statement E (the same enolate readily alkylates methyl and primary halides) as well as any claim that the enolate is generally too weak a nucleophile.\n\nStep 3: Hydrolysis and decarboxylation would proceed normally if the appropriate alkylated acetoacetic ester had been formed. Decarboxylation of a beta-keto acid is a well-established, concerted process via a six-membered cyclic transition state and is not prevented by a tert-butyl group at the alpha carbon if that group were present. The failure occurs earlier at the alkylation step, not at hydrolysis or decarboxylation. Therefore, statements B and D are incorrect.\n\nThus, the synthesis fails because the tertiary alkyl halide does not undergo $\\text{S}_N2$ alkylation with the enolate; instead, the enolate acts as a base to induce elimination, giving 2-methylpropene and regenerating ethyl acetoacetate. The most accurate statement is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2151302"}]}
