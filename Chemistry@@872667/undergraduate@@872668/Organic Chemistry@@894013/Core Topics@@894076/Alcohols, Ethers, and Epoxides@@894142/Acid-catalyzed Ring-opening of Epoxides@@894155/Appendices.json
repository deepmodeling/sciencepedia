The reaction occurs with a large excess of ethanol under catalytic $H_2SO_4$, i.e., acid-catalyzed epoxide opening by a neutral nucleophile (EtOH).\n\n2) First mechanistic step (activation): The epoxide oxygen is protonated by $H_2SO_4$ to give a protonated epoxide. This increases the electrophilicity of the ring carbons and imparts greater carbocationic character at the more substituted carbon (C-2).\n\n3) Regioselectivity under acidic conditions: For unsymmetrical epoxides under acid catalysis, the nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon due to better stabilization of positive charge in the transition state. Therefore, ethanol attacks C-2, not C-1.\n\n4) Stereochemical course at the attacked carbon: Opening of a protonated epoxide by a nucleophile proceeds with backside attack at the carbon being attacked ($S_{\\mathrm{N}}2$-like), giving inversion of configuration at that carbon. Since the starting epoxide has configuration (S) at C-2, attack at C-2 with backside displacement inverts this center to give the (R) configuration in the product.\n\n5) Connectivity and functional groups after ring opening: Attack of EtOH at C-2 installs an ethoxy group at C-2. The epoxide oxygen remains attached to C-1 and, after deprotonation, becomes a hydroxyl group on C-1. Thus, the product framework is HO–CH_{2}–CH(OEt)–CH_{3}, i.e., 2-ethoxypropan-1-ol.\n\n6) Chirality analysis of the product: The only stereocenter is at C-2 (bearing OEt, CH_{3}, CH_{2}OH, and H). C-1 is CH_{2}OH and is not chiral. Because the opening is $S_{\\mathrm{N}}2$-like at C-2, a single enantiomer forms with inversion relative to the starting (S) epoxide, yielding the (R) product.

This is a problem concerning the regioselectivity and stereochemistry of epoxide ring-opening reactions.\n\nStep 1: Mechanism of Acid-Catalyzed Epoxide Opening\nThe reaction begins with the protonation of the epoxide oxygen by the acid catalyst ($H_2SO_4$). This converts the ether oxygen, a poor leaving group, into a good leaving group (an alcohol) and activates the epoxide ring toward nucleophilic attack.\n\n$$ \\text{Epoxide} + H^+ \\rightleftharpoons \\text{Protonated Epoxide} $$\n\nThe nucleophile, in this case methanol ($CH_3OH$), then attacks one of the two carbons of the epoxide ring, leading to the breaking of a C-O bond and relieving the ring strain. A final deprotonation step yields the final product and regenerates the acid catalyst.\n\nStep 2: Regioselectivity Analysis\nThe key to this problem is determining which of the two epoxide carbons is preferentially attacked by the methanol nucleophile. The two carbons in 2-(trifluoromethyl)oxirane are C2 (bonded to H and $CF_3$) and C3 (bonded to two H atoms). C2 is a secondary carbon, while C3 is a primary carbon.\n\nThe transition state of the acid-catalyzed ring-opening has significant carbocationic character. The positive charge is distributed between the oxygen and the two carbon atoms. The nucleophile will preferably attack the carbon atom that can better stabilize the developing positive charge ($\\delta+$).\n\n- Path A: Attack at the more substituted carbon (C2). In a typical case with alkyl substituents (which are electron-donating), attack occurs at the more substituted carbon because it can better stabilize a carbocation. However, in this problem, C2 is attached to a trifluoromethyl ($CF_3$) group.\n- Path B: Attack at the less substituted carbon (C3).\n\nStep 3: Electronic Effect of the Trifluoromethyl ($CF_3$) Group\nThe $CF_3$ group is a very strong electron-withdrawing group due to the high electronegativity of the three fluorine atoms. This powerful inductive effect ($-\\text{I}$ effect) strongly destabilizes any positive charge on an adjacent carbon atom.\n\nTherefore, the transition state for attack at C2, which would involve building up a partial positive charge on C2, is severely disfavored. The electron-withdrawing $CF_3$ group actively resists the formation of a positive charge at the adjacent position. Conversely, the transition state for attack at C3 places the developing positive charge further away from the destabilizing $CF_3$ group. Although C3 is a primary carbon and less able to stabilize charge than a secondary carbon in isolation, avoiding the potent destabilizing effect of the $CF_3$ group is the dominant factor.\n\nConclusion on regioselectivity: The reaction proceeds via an $S_{\\mathrm{N}}2$-like mechanism where the nucleophile ($CH_3OH$) attacks the sterically less hindered and electronically less destabilized carbon, which is C3 (the $CH_2$ group).\n\nStep 4: Structure of the Major Product\nFollowing the major pathway (attack at C3), the methanol molecule attacks C3, and the $C_2\\text{–}O$ bond of the epoxide breaks. This forms an intermediate which is then deprotonated.\n- Nucleophilic attack: $CH_3OH \\rightarrow C3$\n- Bond breaking: $C_2\\text{–}O$\n- Initial product: $\\text{CH}_3\\text{O-CH}_2\\text{-CH(CF}_3\\text{)-OH}_2^+$\n- Deprotonation: $\\text{CH}_3\\text{O-CH}_2\\text{-CH(OH)-CF}_3$\n\nThe IUPAC name for this structure is 1-methoxy-3,3,3-trifluoropropan-2-ol.\n\nStep 5: Stereochemical Analysis\nThe starting material is the (R) enantiomer of 2-(trifluoromethyl)oxirane. The stereocenter is C2. The nucleophilic attack occurs at C3, which is not a stereocenter. Since the reaction does not take place at the C2 stereocenter, the configuration of this center is retained in the product.\n\nThe (R) configuration of the starting material's C2 atom is preserved in the corresponding chiral center of the product. The chiral center in the product, 1-methoxy-3,3,3-trifluoropropan-2-ol, is the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group. Therefore, the major product will be (R)-1-methoxy-3,3,3-trifluoropropan-2-ol.\n\nStep 6: Final Conclusion\nThe major product is formed by nucleophilic attack of methanol at the less substituted carbon (C3) of the protonated epoxide, with retention of configuration at the stereocenter (C2). This leads to the formation of (R)-1-methoxy-3,3,3-trifluoropropan-2-ol. Comparing this to the options provided, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2152380"}]}
