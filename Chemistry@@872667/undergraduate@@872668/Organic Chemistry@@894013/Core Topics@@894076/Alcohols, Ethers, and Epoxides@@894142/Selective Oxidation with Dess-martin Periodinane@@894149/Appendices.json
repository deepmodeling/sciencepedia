Dess-Martin periodinane (DMP) is a mild, selective oxidizing agent that converts primary alcohols to aldehydes under neutral, anhydrous conditions and at room temperature.

An optimal aqueous workup must (i) safely quench residual oxidants, (ii) neutralize and remove acidic byproducts as water-soluble salts, and (iii) retain the neutral ketone in the organic phase, followed by standard drying and concentration.\n\nPrinciple 1: Neutralization of acids with sodium bicarbonate.\nAcidic byproducts are converted to their corresponding sodium carboxylate salts, driving them into the aqueous phase and removing them from the organic layer. For acetic acid:\n$$\n\\text{CH}_3\\text{COOH} + \\text{NaHCO}_3 \\to \\text{CH}_3\\text{COO}^-\\text{Na}^+ + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} + \\text{CO}_2\\uparrow\n$$\nSimilarly, IBX-acid (a carboxylic acid) is deprotonated:\n$$\n\\text{RCOOH} + \\text{NaHCO}_3 \\to \\text{RCOO}^-\\text{Na}^+ + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} + \\text{CO}_2\\uparrow\n$$\nThe evolution of $\\text{CO}_2$ requires frequent venting when shaking in a separatory funnel.\n\nPrinciple 2: Reductive quench of iodine-containing oxidants with sodium thiosulfate.\nSodium thiosulfate reduces iodine species to iodide, rendering residual DMP-derived hypervalent iodine species and any iodine formed into innocuous, water-soluble iodide. The standard redox reaction with iodine is:\n$$\n\\text{I}_2 + 2\\,\\text{S}_2\\text{O}_3^{2-} \\to 2\\,\\text{I}^- + \\text{S}_4\\text{O}_6^{2-}\n$$\nBy analogy, thiosulfate effectively reduces hypervalent iodine byproducts to lower oxidation state iodide species that partition into the aqueous layer.\n\nPrinciple 3: Phase partitioning and product retention.\nThe desired ketone is neutral and relatively nonpolar; it remains in the $\\text{CH}_2\\text{Cl}_2$ layer. Acidic byproducts, once converted to sodium carboxylates, and reduced iodine species are water-soluble and move into the aqueous layer. A subsequent brine wash helps to remove residual water and salts from the organic layer, facilitating drying. Drying over anhydrous sulfate removes remaining water prior to solvent removal.\n\nEvaluation of the options:\n- Option A uses only water. It neither neutralizes acidic byproducts efficiently nor reduces residual iodine oxidants, leaving reactive and polar impurities in the organic phase and posing safety and purity issues. Therefore, it is not optimal.\n- Option B uses strong base $\\text{NaOH}$. While it neutralizes acids, strong base can induce side reactions such as enolate formation, double-bond isomerization, or migration, risking loss of the $(Z)$-alkene geometry and potential rearrangements. It also does not specifically address iodine oxidants. Thus, it is not preferred.\n- Option C employs saturated $\\text{NaHCO}_3$ to neutralize acids and $\\text{Na}_2\\text{S}_2\\text{O}_3$ to reduce iodine species, with explicit venting for $\\text{CO}_2$, followed by brine wash and drying—this directly addresses all key needs and is the standard DMP workup.\n- Option D uses only $\\text{Na}_2\\text{S}_2\\text{O}_3$; acids remain unneutralized and can persist in the organic layer, compromising purity and potentially causing downstream issues. Not optimal.\n- Option E assumes the ketone partitions into the aqueous layer and suggests discarding the organic layer; this is chemically incorrect for a neutral ketone in $\\text{CH}_2\\text{Cl}_2$. It would lose the product.\n\nTherefore, the most chemically sound and effective workup is the combined $\\text{NaHCO}_3$ and $\\text{Na}_2\\text{S}_2\\text{O}_3$ quench with venting, followed by brine wash and drying, as specified in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2198530"}, {"introduction": "Great chemists not only know the common reactions but also understand how to predict outcomes with less familiar substrates.
