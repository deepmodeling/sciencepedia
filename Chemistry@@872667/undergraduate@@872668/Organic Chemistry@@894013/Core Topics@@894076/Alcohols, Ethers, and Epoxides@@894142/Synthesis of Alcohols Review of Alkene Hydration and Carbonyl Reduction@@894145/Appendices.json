Consider the specific reaction where hexanal is treated with sodium borohydride, using methanol as the solvent. This process selectively transforms the aldehyde functional group. Identify the major organic product formed in this reaction from the options provided below.\n\nA. Hexan-1-ol\nB. Hexan-2-ol\nC. Hexanoic acid\nD. 2-Methylpentan-1-ol\nE. Hexane", "solution": "We identify the functional group and the reagent’s selectivity. Hexanal is an aldehyde with a six-carbon chain and a terminal carbonyl group. Sodium borohydride is a selective hydride donor that reduces aldehydes and ketones to alcohols under mild conditions; in methanol, the solvent serves as the proton source to quench the alkoxide intermediate. Under these conditions, sodium borohydride does not reduce carboxylic acids to alcohols, does not alter the carbon skeleton, and does not fully deoxygenate to an alkane.\n\nThe general reduction of an aldehyde by sodium borohydride in an alcohol solvent proceeds via hydride transfer to the electrophilic carbonyl carbon, forming an alkoxide, followed by protonation by the solvent:\n$$\n\\text{R-CHO} + \\text{NaBH}_4 \\xrightarrow{\\text{MeOH}} \\text{R-CH}_2\\text{O}^- \\xrightarrow{\\text{MeOH}} \\text{R-CH}_2\\text{OH}.\n$$\nApplying this to hexanal ($\\text{CH}_3(\\text{CH}_2)_4\\text{CHO}$), the carbonyl at C1 is reduced to a primary alcohol without rearrangement or chain shortening/lengthening, giving hexan-1-ol.\n\nWe exclude the other options based on reactivity:\n- Hexan-2-ol would require reduction of a ketone or rearrangement, which does not occur here.\n- Hexanoic acid is the oxidation product of hexanal, not the reduction product.\n- 2-Methylpentan-1-ol would require carbon skeleton rearrangement, which does not occur with sodium borohydride.\n- Hexane would require deoxygenation, which sodium borohydride does not effect under these conditions.\n\nTherefore, the major product is hexan-1-ol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2206768"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simple substrates, synthetic chemists must often control reactions on molecules with multiple functional groups. This practice [@problem_id:2206781] introduces the critical concept of chemoselectivity, challenging you to predict the outcome when a reducing agent is presented with both an aldehyde and a ketone. Understanding the inherent reactivity differences between carbonyl groups is key to designing successful, targeted syntheses.", "problem": "In a laboratory synthesis, a chemist treats 4-oxocyclohexane-1-carbaldehyde with exactly one molar equivalent of sodium borohydride ($NaBH_4$) in methanol as a solvent. The reaction is maintained at a low temperature of -78 °C to ensure selectivity. After an appropriate reaction time and aqueous workup, a single major organic product is isolated.\n\nWhich of the following compounds represents the major product of this reaction?\n\nA. 4-(Hydroxymethyl)cyclohexan-1-one\nB. 4-Hydroxycyclohexane-1-carbaldehyde\nC. 4-(Hydroxymethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol\nD. 4-Oxocyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid\nE. Cyclohexane-1,4-dicarbaldehyde", "solution": "Identify the functional groups in 4-oxocyclohexane-1-carbaldehyde: there is an aldehyde at C1 (carbaldehyde) and a ketone at C4 (oxo). Sodium borohydride in methanol is a hydride donor that reduces polar carbonyls via nucleophilic hydride transfer from $BH_4^-$ to the electrophilic carbonyl carbon to give an alkoxide, which upon aqueous workup is protonated to the corresponding alcohol.\n\nKey chemoselectivity principle: aldehydes are more electrophilic and less sterically hindered than ketones; therefore, their reduction by $BH_4^-$ is faster. Under carefully controlled, low-temperature conditions, the kinetic preference for aldehyde reduction over ketone reduction is enhanced. The use of exactly one molar equivalent of $NaBH_4$, combined with the low temperature in methanol, ensures preferential and essentially exclusive reduction of the aldehyde while leaving the ketone unreacted.\n\nThus, only the aldehyde at C1 is reduced to a primary alcohol ($-CH_2OH$), and the ketone at C4 remains intact. After aqueous workup, the product is the cyclohexanone bearing a para (1,4) hydroxymethyl substituent relative to the carbonyl. By IUPAC naming conventions, the ketone is the principal functional group in the product, so it is named as cyclohexan-1-one with a hydroxymethyl substituent at C4: 4-(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\nMatching with the options:\n- A corresponds to reduction of only the aldehyde (correct).\n- B corresponds to reduction of only the ketone (disfavored under these conditions).\n- C corresponds to reduction of both carbonyls (requires further reduction beyond the selective conditions).\n- D is an oxidation product, not formed by $NaBH_4$.\n- E is unrelated to a hydride reduction outcome.\n\nTherefore, the major product is 4-(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexan-1-one.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2206781"}, {"introduction": "This final practice integrates reaction chemistry with spectroscopic analysis, a combination central to modern organic chemistry. Here, you will use the outcome of an alkene hydration reaction—specifically, the structural clues provided by a simple $^1$H NMR spectrum—to deduce the identity of both the alcohol product and its alkene precursor [@problem_id:2206800]. This exercise simulates the process of structure elucidation, where chemists piece together evidence to solve a molecular puzzle.", "problem": "An unknown alkene with the molecular formula $C_7H_{14}$ undergoes an oxymercuration-demercuration reaction. The alkene is first treated with mercury(II) acetate, $Hg(OAc)_2$, in water, followed by a reduction step with sodium borohydride, $NaBH_4$. The resulting alcohol product is isolated and analyzed. Its proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ($^1$H NMR) spectrum displays a remarkably simple pattern, consisting of only three distinct signals: a singlet, a quartet, and a triplet.\n\nBased on this information, identify the correct International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) names for both the starting alkene and the final alcohol product from the options below.\n\nA. Alkene: 3-ethyl-2-pentene, Alcohol: 3-ethyl-3-pentanol\nB. Alkene: 2,3-dimethyl-2-pentene, Alcohol: 2,3-dimethyl-2-pentanol\nC. Alkene: 3-ethyl-2-pentene, Alcohol: 3-ethyl-2-pentanol\nD. Alkene: 2-ethyl-1-pentene, Alcohol: 2-ethyl-1-pentanol\nE. Alkene: hept-1-ene, Alcohol: heptan-2-ol", "solution": "We are told the alkene has formula $C_7H_{14}$ and undergoes oxymercuration-demercuration (treatment with $Hg(OAc)_2$ in water, followed by $NaBH_4$), which gives Markovnikov hydration across the double bond without carbocation rearrangement. Thus, the hydroxyl group installs at the more substituted alkene carbon, yielding the corresponding Markovnikov alcohol.\n\nThe $^1$H NMR of the alcohol shows only three signals: a singlet, a quartet, and a triplet. Interpreting the splitting via the $n+1$ rule:\n- A quartet and a triplet together strongly indicate an ethyl fragment, where the methylene adjacent to a methyl appears as a quartet (coupled to $n=3$ protons) and the methyl appears as a triplet (coupled to $n=2$ protons).\n- The singlet is consistent with an exchangeable $OH$ proton that typically does not show vicinal coupling in protic solvents.\n\nFor the alcohol to display only these three signals, the carbon framework must make all ethyl groups equivalent and avoid additional distinct proton environments. This occurs in a highly symmetric tertiary alcohol in which the carbon bearing the $OH$ is bonded to three identical ethyl groups. That structure is 3-ethyl-3-pentanol (triethylcarbinol). In this molecule:\n- All three $CH_2$ groups directly attached to the tertiary carbon are equivalent, giving one signal (quartet by coupling to the adjacent methyls).\n- All three terminal $CH_3$ groups are equivalent, giving one signal (triplet by coupling to the adjacent methylenes).\n- The $OH$ appears as a singlet.\nHence exactly three signals: singlet, quartet, triplet.\n\nTherefore, the alcohol must be 3-ethyl-3-pentanol. By Markovnikov addition without rearrangement, the corresponding alkene precursor is the one that places the $OH$ at the more substituted alkene carbon to yield that tertiary center: 3-ethyl-2-pentene. Checking the options:\n\n- A: Alkene 3-ethyl-2-pentene gives Alcohol 3-ethyl-3-pentanol under Markovnikov hydration; the product has the required simple NMR (singlet, quartet, triplet).\n- B: 2,3-dimethyl-2-pentanol would not have only three signals; multiple inequivalent methyl and methine/methylene environments would be present.\n- C: Places $OH$ at C2 (anti-Markovnikov relative to the more substituted carbon in 3-ethyl-2-pentene), inconsistent with oxymercuration.\n- D: Predicts 2-ethyl-1-pentanol from 2-ethyl-1-pentene, which is not the Markovnikov product.\n- E: Heptan-2-ol would exhibit many more than three distinct proton signals.\n\nThus the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2206800"}]}
