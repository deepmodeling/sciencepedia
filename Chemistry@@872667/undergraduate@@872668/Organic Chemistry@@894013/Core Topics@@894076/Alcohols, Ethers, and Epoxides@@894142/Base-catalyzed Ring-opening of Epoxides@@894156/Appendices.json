An unequal mixture of two chiral diastereomers is formed.\nE. A racemic mixture of two chiral diastereomers is formed.", "solution": "The substrate is *cis*-2,3-dimethyloxirane, which is an achiral meso epoxide bearing two stereocenters with opposite configurations (one carbon is R and the other is S). In a basic medium with methoxide as nucleophile, epoxide opening proceeds by an $S_N2$ mechanism at an epoxide carbon, characterized by backside attack at the less substituted carbon and inversion of configuration at the carbon that is attacked. For *cis*-2,3-dimethyloxirane, both epoxide carbons are equivalent (each secondary), so attack at either carbon is equally probable.\n\nMechanistically, methoxide attacks one epoxide carbon with inversion at that center, breaking the C–O bond at the attacked carbon and leaving the oxygen attached to the other carbon as an alkoxide. After ring opening, the alkoxide is protonated in the aqueous acid workup to give an alcohol. The stereochemical consequence is that the configuration at the attacked carbon inverts, while the configuration at the non-attacked carbon remains unchanged; the nucleophile and the oxygen substituent add in an overall anti fashion.\n\nStarting from the meso epoxide with configurations R,S, attack at the R center gives inversion to S at that carbon while the other S center is retained, yielding the S,S product. Conversely, attack at the S center gives inversion to R at that carbon while the other R center is retained, yielding the R,R product. These two products are non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers) and are formed in equal amounts because the two epoxide carbons are enantiotopic in the meso substrate and the nucleophile and conditions are achiral.\n\nThe products are thus chiral and not meso, because the two adjacent stereocenters bear different substituents (OMe on one carbon and OH on the other), which precludes an internal mirror plane. The acid workup only protonates the alkoxide and does not alter stereochemistry further.\n\nTherefore, the reaction produces a racemic mixture of two chiral enantiomers, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2156557"}, {"introduction": "The true power of a chemical reaction lies in its application to building complex molecules. This final practice problem [@problem_id:2156532] challenges you to think like a synthetic chemist by designing a two-step sequence to prepare a specific target molecule.

This two-step process begins with the epoxidation of an alkene, followed by a nucleophilic attack on the resulting epoxide.\n\nYour task is to determine the correct starting materials for the synthesis of the target molecule, 1-propoxy-2-pentanol. The synthesis must proceed via the formation of an epoxide from an alkene using an oxidizing agent like meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (m-CPBA), followed by a ring-opening reaction using a basic sodium alkoxide nucleophile in an appropriate solvent, and a final aqueous workup.\n\nWhich of the following combinations of starting alkene and sodium alkoxide reagent will successfully produce 1-propoxy-2-pentanol as the major product?\n\nA.

Therefore, the carbon–oxygen bond pattern must be at C1: $-\\text{OCH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3$, and at C2: $-\\text{OH}$.\n\nPrinciple 1: Epoxidation of an alkene with an oxidant such as m-CPBA forms an epoxide across the original double bond carbons. Thus, to place the hydroxyl and the alkoxy on adjacent carbons C1 and C2 of a pentane chain, the epoxide precursor must be the $1,2$-epoxide of pentane, which arises from epoxidation of $1$-pentene. Epoxidation of $2$-pentene would give a $2,3$-epoxide, leading to substitution at C2 and C3, not C1 and C2.\n\nPrinciple 2: Under basic conditions, epoxide ring opening by an alkoxide proceeds via an $S_N2$-like mechanism, with nucleophilic attack at the less substituted epoxide carbon (backside attack), forming an alkoxide on the other carbon. For the $1,2$-epoxide of pentane, the less substituted carbon is C1 (primary), so the alkoxide nucleophile must attack C1 to install the ether at C1 while leaving the epoxide oxygen on C2 as an alkoxide, which is then protonated to an alcohol in aqueous workup.\n\nApplication: Choose the alkene as $1$-pentene to give the $1,2$-epoxide of pentane. Choose the nucleophile as sodium propoxide so that attack at C1 installs the $n$-propoxy group at C1. After aqueous workup, the oxygen originally in the epoxide becomes the hydroxyl at C2, giving 1-propoxy-2-pentanol.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A (2-pentene, sodium propoxide): gives a $2,3$-epoxide and hence substitution at C2 and C3, not the target.\n- B (1-pentene, sodium ethoxide): installs an ethoxy group, giving 1-ethoxy-2-pentanol, not the target.\n- C (1-pentene, sodium propoxide): installs propoxy at C1 and OH at C2 after workup; matches the target.\n- D (propene, sodium 2-pentoxide): wrong carbon skeleton and positions; yields a propanol derivative, not a pentanol.\n- E (2-pentene, sodium 2-pentoxide): substitution at C2 and C3, not the target.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination is 1-pentene with sodium propoxide.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2156532"}]}
