The reaction proceeds via an $S_N2$ mechanism, where a deprotonated alcohol (an alkoxide) acts as a nucleophile to attack an alkyl halide, displacing the halide.\n\nConsider the synthesis of the fuel additive methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), which has the chemical structure $(\\text{CH}_3)_3\\text{C-O-CH}_3$. To synthesize MTBE using the Williamson ether synthesis, one must choose an appropriate pair of reactants: an alkoxide and an alkyl halide. While two theoretical pairings of reactants could lead to the desired product, only one of these pathways is practically viable due to the specific mechanistic requirements and potential competing side reactions.\n\nFrom the options below, select the single set of reactants that will successfully produce methyl tert-butyl ether as the major product.\n\nA.

Both pathways described in A and B are equally effective.", "solution": "The goal is to synthesize methyl tert-butyl ether, $(\\text{CH}_3)_3\\text{C-O-CH}_3$, using the Williamson ether synthesis. This reaction follows an $S_N2$ mechanism, where an alkoxide ion ($RO^-$) attacks an alkyl halide ($R'X$). The efficiency of an $S_N2$ reaction is highly dependent on the structure of the alkyl halide. The reactivity order for $S_N2$ reactions is: methyl > primary (1°) > secondary (2°) >> tertiary (3°). Tertiary alkyl halides are essentially unreactive in $S_N2$ reactions due to severe steric hindrance that prevents the required backside attack by the nucleophile.\n\nWe can analyze the two possible retrosynthetic disconnections for methyl tert-butyl ether:\n\n**Pathway 1: Corresponds to Option A**\n\nThis pathway involves the reaction between sodium methoxide ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{ONa}$) and a tertiary alkyl halide, tert-butyl bromide ($(\\text{CH}_3)_3\\text{CBr}$).\n- Alkoxide: Methoxide ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{O}^-$), which is a strong nucleophile and a strong, unhindered base.\n- Alkyl Halide: tert-Butyl bromide, which is a tertiary (3°) alkyl halide.\n\nBecause the alkyl halide is tertiary, the carbon atom bonded to the bromine is sterically hindered by three methyl groups. This steric bulk prevents the methoxide nucleophile from performing a backside attack, which is necessary for an $S_N2$ reaction. Instead, the strong base (methoxide) will abstract a proton from one of the beta-carbons (the carbons of the methyl groups). This leads to a competing $E2$ (elimination) reaction, which is the dominant pathway. The major product of this reaction will be an alkene, 2-methylpropene, not the desired ether. Therefore, option A is not a viable synthetic route.\n\n$$(\\text{CH}_3)_3\\text{CBr} + \\text{CH}_3\\text{O}^- \\text{Na}^+ \\longrightarrow (\\text{CH}_3)_2\\text{C=CH}_2 + \\text{CH}_3\\text{OH} + \\text{NaBr}$$\n\n**Pathway 2: Corresponds to Option B**\n\nThis pathway involves the reaction between sodium tert-butoxide ($(\\text{CH}_3)_3\\text{CONa}$) and a methyl halide, methyl iodide ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{I}$).\n- Alkoxide: tert-Butoxide ($(\\text{CH}_3)_3\\text{CO}^-$), which is a strong, sterically hindered base but can still act as a nucleophile.\n- Alkyl Halide: Methyl iodide, which is a methyl halide.\n\nIn this case, the alkyl halide is a methyl halide. The carbon atom is unhindered and is an excellent substrate for the $S_N2$ reaction. Even though the nucleophile (tert-butoxide) is bulky, it can easily access the electrophilic carbon of the methyl group to perform the backside attack. The $E2$ elimination reaction cannot occur because methyl iodide does not have any beta-hydrogens to abstract. Thus, the $S_N2$ reaction proceeds efficiently to yield the desired product, methyl tert-butyl ether.\n\n$$(\\text{CH}_3)_3\\text{CO}^- \\text{Na}^+ + \\text{CH}_3\\text{I} \\longrightarrow (\\text{CH}_3)_3\\text{CO-CH}_3 + \\text{NaI}$$\n\nTherefore, option B represents the only viable and effective pathway for synthesizing methyl tert-butyl ether via the Williamson ether synthesis.\n\n**Analysis of Other Options:**\n\n- **Option C:** This describes an acid-catalyzed synthesis of an ether from an alcohol and another alcohol (formed in situ from the alkyl chloride). While this can produce ethers, it is not a Williamson ether synthesis, which is defined by the reaction of an alkoxide with an alkyl halide.\n- **Option D:** This is incorrect, as we have identified a viable route in option B.\n- **Option E:** This is incorrect because pathway A leads predominantly to elimination, making it an ineffective route for ether synthesis.\n\nConclusion: The correct choice is the combination of a bulky alkoxide and an unhindered alkyl halide.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2215554"}, {"introduction": "Beyond forming ethers between two separate molecules, the Williamson synthesis is a powerful tool for creating cyclic structures through intramolecular reactions.

Your task will be to predict not just the structure, but also the precise stereochemistry of the product, reinforcing the concept of backside attack and inversion of configuration inherent to the $S_N2$ mechanism.", "problem": "An organic chemist investigates an intramolecular cyclization reaction to synthesize a chiral epoxide.

Deprotonation occurs at oxygen; no bonds to the stereogenic carbon C2 are broken, so the configuration at C2 is retained as R at this stage.\n\nStep 2: The intramolecular ring closure proceeds by an $S_N2$ displacement of bromide at C3 by the C2 alkoxide. An $S_N2$ reaction at a stereogenic center inverts its configuration. Therefore, the configuration at C3 changes from S in the starting material to R in the product.\n\nStep 3: The new bond formed between the oxygen and C3 closes a three-membered ring, giving an epoxide, specifically 2,3-dimethyloxirane. The carbon at C2 does not undergo substitution; it retains its configuration. A Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) check confirms this: at C2, the highest priority remains the oxygen, followed by the C3 substituent (which has higher priority than the methyl), and then the methyl group, so the initial R configuration remains R after ring closure. At C3, inversion through $S_N2$ flips S to R.\n\nStep 4: Because the reaction proceeds via an intramolecular $S_N2$ and the starting material is enantiomerically pure, the product is a single enantiomer, not a racemate. The relative stereochemistry corresponds to the trans-2,3-disubstituted epoxide, which exists as an enantiomeric pair, (2R,3R) and (2S,3S).

Ethyl 2-cyclohexanonecarboxylate is a cyclic beta-ketoester. Deprotonation at the methine carbon between the ketone and the ester produces an enolate that is ambident: it can react at carbon (C-alkylation) to give ethyl 1-methyl-2-oxocyclohexane-1-carboxylate (Product C), or at oxygen (O-alkylation) to give the methyl enol ether ethyl 2-methoxycyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxylate (Product O).\n\nRationalize C- versus O-alkylation with HSAB and solvation/counterion effects. For an enolate, the oxygen is a harder base and the alpha-carbon is a softer base. Methyl iodide is a soft electrophile. HSAB matching hence intrinsically favors attack at carbon over oxygen in the absence of other effects. However, actual selectivity depends strongly on:\n- Counterion: more covalent, tightly ion-paired enolates (e.g., lithium) favor C-alkylation; more ionic, oxygen-centered enolates (e.g., potassium) favor O-alkylation.\n- Solvent: protic, hydrogen-bonding solvents solvate the enolate oxygen, suppressing its nucleophilicity and steering toward C-alkylation; polar aprotic solvents increase ion separation and make the enolate more reactive at oxygen.\n- Temperature/kinetics: O-alkylation is typically faster (kinetically favored) due to the higher basicity/nucleophilicity at oxygen, while C-alkylation is often the preferred pathway under conditions that damp oxygen nucleophilicity or require higher activation energy (e.g., more strongly paired enolates or protic solvation). For primary alkyl halides like methyl iodide, C-alkylation is the normal outcome unless conditions deliberately enhance O-reactivity.\n\nMap these principles to the given condition sets.\n\nFor maximizing Product C (C-alkylation):\n- Use conditions that suppress O-attack: protic solvent to hydrogen-bond the enolate oxygen and a hard alkoxide base that generates a sodium enolate, plus elevated temperature to overcome the barrier for C-attack. Sodium ethoxide in ethanol under reflux does exactly this: ethanol solvates the oxygen, sodium forms a tighter ion pair than potassium in protic medium, and methyl iodide, being a soft electrophile, then reacts predominantly at carbon to give Product C.\n\nFor maximizing Product O (O-alkylation):\n- Use conditions that enhance the oxygen character of the enolate and minimize solvation: a large, weakly coordinating potassium counterion and a polar aprotic solvent, at low temperature to capture the kinetic O-alkylation. Potassium hydride in DMF at low temperature generates the potassium enolate with substantial negative charge localized on oxygen in a polar aprotic medium; the resulting highly reactive enolate oxygen undergoes fast O-alkylation with methyl iodide to give the enol ether (Product O).\n\nEvaluate alternatives to eliminate them:\n- B reverses the above logic, assigning KH/DMF, low temperature to C-alkylation (contrary to the O-alkylation bias of potassium enolates in polar aprotic solvents) and NaOEt/EtOH, reflux to O-alkylation (contrary to protic-solvent suppression of O-attack).\n- C proposes tert-butoxide in tert-butanol under reflux for O-alkylation; tert-butoxide reacts rapidly with methyl iodide to form tert-butyl methyl ether, depleting the electrophile and disfavoring substrate alkylation; moreover, protic solvent again disfavors O-attack on the enolate.\n- D uses LDA/THF, low temperature for Product C (which generally does give C-alkylation), but pairs Product O with NaOH in water; hydroxide in water will poorly generate the enolate and will also promote hydrolysis or phase/miscibility problems, not selective O-alkylation.\n- E assigns silver(I) oxide in benzene, reflux to Product C; silver salts commonly promote O-alkylation of enols/enolates by halophile activation of alkyl halides, which would bias toward enol ether formation, opposite to the assignment here, and NaH/THF, reflux would favor C-alkylation rather than O.\n\nTherefore, the only pair consistent with HSAB, solvent and counterion effects, and kinetic versus thermodynamic considerations is:\n- Product C: Sodium ethoxide in ethanol, reflux.\n- Product O: Potassium hydride in DMF, low temperature.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2215570"}]}
