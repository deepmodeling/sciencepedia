This first practice focuses on the bromination of benzene, a classic example of EAS. By critically evaluating statements about the reaction pathway, you will solidify your understanding of the roles of the nucleophile, electrophile, Lewis acid catalyst, and the crucial resonance-stabilized intermediate known as the sigma complex [@problem_id:2173696].", "problem": "Benzene is a stable aromatic compound that undergoes electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions rather than addition reactions. A classic example is its reaction with molecular bromine ($Br_2$) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, such as iron(III) bromide ($FeBr_3$), to produce bromobenzene ($C_6H_5Br$) and hydrogen bromide ($HBr$).\n\nConsider the complete mechanism for the bromination of benzene using $Br_2$ and $FeBr_3$. From the list of statements below, identify all that are chemically correct descriptions of the species or steps involved in this reaction.\n\nA. The active electrophile that attacks the benzene ring is a free $Br^+$ cation, which is generated by the spontaneous heterolytic cleavage of a $Br_2$ molecule.\n\nB. The iron(III) bromide catalyst functions by reacting with a bromine molecule to form the complex anion $[FeBr_4]^-$.\n\nC. The intermediate formed immediately after the electrophilic attack on the benzene ring is a resonance-stabilized carbocation, commonly referred to as a sigma complex or an arenium ion.\n\nD. Aromaticity is restored in the final step of the mechanism by the elimination of a bromide ion ($Br^-$) from the carbocation intermediate.\n\nE. The pi electron system of the benzene ring functions as a nucleophile during the reaction.\n\nF. After the carbocation intermediate is formed, a molecule of $Br_2$ acts as a base to remove a proton and restore the aromaticity of the ring.", "solution": "Electrophilic aromatic substitution of benzene with bromine requires activation of the halogen by a Lewis acid. The Lewis acid $FeBr_3$ coordinates to a $Br_2$ molecule to polarize the $Br-Br$ bond, which is often represented formally as generating a highly electrophilic bromine species together with the counterion $[FeBr_4]^-$. The aromatic $\\pi$ system of benzene donates electron density to the electrophilic bromine, forming a $\\sigma$ bond to bromine and producing the arenium ion (sigma complex), a resonance-stabilized carbocation intermediate. In the final step, a base removes the proton from the carbon that was attacked, re-forming the aromatic $\\pi$ system and giving $HBr$ while regenerating the $FeBr_3$ catalyst. In this mechanism, the base is the bromide contained in $[FeBr_4]^-$, which abstracts the proton to yield $HBr$ and $FeBr_3$.\n\nAssessing each statement:\n\nA. Incorrect. The active electrophile is not a free, freely solvated $Br^+$ formed by spontaneous heterolysis of $Br_2$. Instead, $Br_2$ is activated by complexation with $FeBr_3$, and electrophilic attack proceeds via the polarized $Br_2 \\cdot FeBr_3$ complex or a formally represented $Br^+$ paired with $[FeBr_4]^-$; a free $Br^+$ is not generated by spontaneous heterolysis.\n\nB. Correct. The Lewis acid $FeBr_3$ reacts with $Br_2$ to form a complex that is commonly represented as $Br^+$ and the complex anion $[FeBr_4]^-$. The presence of $[FeBr_4]^-$ as the counterion and subsequent base is an essential feature of the mechanism.\n\nC. Correct. After electrophilic attack, the intermediate is a resonance-stabilized carbocation known as the sigma complex or arenium ion.\n\nD. Incorrect. Restoration of aromaticity occurs by deprotonation (loss of $H^+$) from the arenium ion; it is not by elimination of $Br^-$ from the carbocation. The $Br$ remains attached to the ring in the product.\n\nE. Correct. The benzene $\\pi$ electron system functions as the nucleophile, donating electron density to the electrophile.\n\nF. Incorrect. The species that acts as the base to remove the proton is $[FeBr_4]^-$ (equivalently $Br^-$ bound to $FeBr_3$), not a molecule of $Br_2$.\n\nTherefore, the correct statements are B, C, and E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BCE}$$", "id": "2173696"}, {"introduction": "How can we be certain about the steps in a reaction mechanism that happen too fast to observe directly? This thought experiment demonstrates a powerful technique used by chemists: isotopic labeling.

The nitronium ion $NO_2^+$ is formed by retaining the two $N=^{18}O$ oxygens from nitric acid; thus both oxygens in $NO_2^+$ are $^{18}O$.\n\nStep 2: Electrophilic substitution on benzene and regeneration of the catalyst.\nThe nitronium ion electrophile nitrates benzene:\n$$C_6H_6 + NO_2^+ \\rightarrow C_6H_6NO_2^+ \\rightarrow C_6H_5NO_2 + H^{+},$$\nfollowed by\n$$H^{+} + HS^{16}O_4^{-} \\rightarrow H_2S^{16}O_4.$$\nThe two oxygens in the nitro group of $C_6H_5NO_2$ are exactly those two $^{18}O$ atoms originally in the $N=^{18}O$ bonds of nitric acid; there is no step that exchanges these oxygens with sulfuric acid. The sulfuric acid remains $H_2S^{16}O_4$, and no $^{18}O$ is incorporated into it under the standard nitration mechanism. The byproduct water is $H_2^{18}O$; under strongly acidic conditions it may exist as $H_3O^+$, but its oxygen is still $^{18}O$.\n\nConclusion: The $^{18}O$ isotope from labeled nitric acid is found both in the nitro group of nitrobenzene (two $^{18}O$ atoms) and in the water byproduct (one $^{18}O$ atom).
