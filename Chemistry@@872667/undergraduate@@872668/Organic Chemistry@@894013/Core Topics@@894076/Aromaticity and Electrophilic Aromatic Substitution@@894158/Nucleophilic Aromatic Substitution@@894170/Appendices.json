By analyzing the reactivity of different aryl halides, this problem ([@problem_id:2185926]) will help you understand why the initial nucleophilic attack is the crucial, rate-determining step and how the halogen's electronegativity governs the reaction speed.", "problem": "A student in an organic chemistry laboratory is tasked with synthesizing 4-methoxynitrobenzene.

The rate-determining step is nucleophilic addition to the aryl carbon bearing the leaving group to form the Meisenheimer intermediate. The stability of this anionic intermediate, and thus the rate, increases when there are strong electron-withdrawing groups that can delocalize and stabilize the negative charge, particularly when located ortho or para to the leaving group (through resonance). Multiple nitro groups further accelerate the reaction, while electron-donating groups at ortho or para positions destabilize the intermediate and decrease the rate.\n\nAnalyze each substrate relative to the chlorine leaving group:\n- Compound I (1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene): It has two nitro groups, one ortho and one para to the leaving group. Both strongly stabilize the Meisenheimer intermediate via resonance and inductive effects. This gives the highest reactivity among the three.\n- Compound II (4-chloronitrobenzene): It has a single nitro group para to the leaving group, providing strong resonance stabilization of the intermediate. This is significantly activated, but less so than the dinitro derivative.\n- Compound III (4-chloro-3-nitrotoluene): The nitro group is ortho to the leaving group, which activates the ring toward $S_N\\text{Ar}$ similarly to a para nitro group, but there is also a methyl group para to the leaving group. The methyl group is electron-donating and destabilizes the anionic intermediate, decreasing the rate relative to a system with only a para nitro group.

Therefore, the reaction proceeds via the benzyne mechanism.\n\n2) Benzyne formation:\n- $\\text{NH}_2^-$ abstracts an ortho proton relative to $Cl$ (at C-2 or C-6). This generates a carbanion adjacent to the carbon bearing $Cl$.\n- Elimination of $\\text{Cl}^-$ from the carbanion produces a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C-1 and C-2 (if C-2 was deprotonated) or between C-1 and C-6 (if C-6 was deprotonated). With a para $-\\text{CH}_3$ substituent, these possibilities are symmetry-related and lead to the same set of products.\n\n3) Nucleophilic addition to benzyne and product regiochemistry:\n- $\\text{NH}_2^-$ adds to either carbon of the benzyne triple bond.\n- Addition at C-1 (the carbon that originally bore $Cl$) followed by protonation by $\\text{NH}_3$ gives an $\\text{NH}_2$ substituent at C-1, with $\\text{CH}_3$ at C-4, i.e., p-toluidine (4-methylaniline).\n- Addition at the adjacent benzyne carbon (C-2 or C-6) followed by protonation gives an $\\text{NH}_2$ substituent at C-2 (or C-6). Relative to $\\text{CH}_3$ at C-4, positions C-2 and C-6 are meta, giving m-toluidine (3-methylaniline).\n- No o-toluidine is formed in this mechanism because the $\\text{NH}_2$ group can only be installed at the benzyne carbons (C-1 and C-2 or C-1 and C-6), which correspond to para or meta positions relative to the $\\text{CH}_3$ at C-4.\n\n4) Conclusion:\n- Under $\\text{NaNH}_2 / \\text{NH}_3\\text{(l)}$, p-chlorotoluene undergoes benzyne-mediated substitution to give a mixture of p-toluidine and m-toluidine.\n- Therefore, the correct choice is the mixture of p- and m-toluidine.\n\nHence, the major organic products are a mixture of p-toluidine and m-toluidine.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2185950"}]}
