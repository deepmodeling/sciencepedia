A species is generally classified as **aromatic** if it adheres to all of the following conditions, known as Hückel's criteria:\n1.  The molecule is cyclic.\n2.  The molecule has a planar structure.\n3.  Every atom in the cyclic ring has an unhybridized p-orbital, creating a continuous, overlapping system of p-orbitals.\n4.  The total number of electrons in the p-orbital system (the $\\pi$ electrons) is equal to $4n+2$, where $n$ is any non-negative integer (i.e., $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$).\n\nConversely, a species is classified as **anti-aromatic** if it meets the first three criteria but has a total of $4n$ $\\pi$ electrons, where $n$ is a positive integer (i.e., $n=1, 2, 3, \\dots$). A species that fails to meet any of the first three criteria is classified as **non-aromatic**.\n\nGiven these definitions, analyze the cyclobutadiene dication, which has the chemical formula $[C_4H_4]^{2+}$.

The species is a four-membered carbon ring, so it is cyclic. The problem states it is planar, satisfying planarity. Each carbon in $C_4H_4$ forms three $\\sigma$ bonds (two C–C and one C–H), which is consistent with $sp^2$ hybridization, leaving one unhybridized $p$ orbital per carbon. Therefore, there is a continuous, overlapping system of $p$ orbitals around the ring.\n\nNext, count the number of $\\pi$ electrons in the ring. Neutral cyclobutadiene has two C=C double bonds, contributing a total of $4$ $\\pi$ electrons. The dication indicates removal of two electrons from the conjugated $\\pi$ system, yielding\n$$\nN_{\\pi}=4-2=2.\n$$\nNow apply Hückel’s $4n+2$ rule. We test whether $N_{\\pi}=2$ can be expressed as $4n+2$ with $n$ a non-negative integer:\n$$\n2=4n+2 \\implies n=0,\n$$\nwhich is allowed. Therefore, the species satisfies all of Hückel’s criteria for aromaticity: cyclic, planar, fully conjugated, and possessing $4n+2$ $\\pi$ electrons with $n=0$.\n\nBecause it does not have $4n$ $\\pi$ electrons, it is not anti-aromatic, and since it meets the first three criteria, it is not non-aromatic.
