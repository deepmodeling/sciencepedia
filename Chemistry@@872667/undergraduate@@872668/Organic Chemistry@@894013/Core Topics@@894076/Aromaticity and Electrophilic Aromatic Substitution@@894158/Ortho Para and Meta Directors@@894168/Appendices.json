By drawing and evaluating the resonance structures for the intermediates of ortho, para, and meta attack, we can understand the electronic basis for regioselectivity. This foundational exercise [@problem_id:2186598] invites you to analyze the intermediates for electrophilic attack on acetophenone, a ring with a deactivating group, to reveal why such groups direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position.", "problem": "In an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, the directing effect of a substituent on a benzene ring is determined by the relative stability of the resonance-stabilized carbocation intermediates, known as arenium ions or sigma complexes. A more stable intermediate implies a lower activation energy for its formation and thus a faster reaction rate for that pathway.\n\nConsider the electrophilic attack of a generic electrophile, $E^+$, on acetophenone (a benzene ring substituted with an acetyl group, -COCH$_3$). Let $I_{ortho}$, $I_{meta}$, and $I_{para}$ represent the arenium ion intermediates formed by the attack at the positions ortho, meta, and para to the acetyl group, respectively. Based on a detailed analysis of the resonance contributors for each of these three intermediates, determine their relative stabilities.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly ranks the arenium ion intermediates in order of decreasing stability (from most stable to least stable)?\n\nA) $I_{meta} > I_{para} > I_{ortho}$\n\nB) $I_{para} > I_{ortho} > I_{meta}$\n\nC) $I_{ortho} > I_{para} > I_{meta}$\n\nD) $I_{ortho} > I_{meta} > I_{para}$\n\nE) $I_{para} > I_{meta} > I_{ortho}$", "solution": "Electrophilic aromatic substitution proceeds through an arenium ion (sigma complex) in which the positive charge is delocalized over the ring. The relative stability of arenium ions determines the favored directing outcome: more stable intermediates correspond to lower activation energies for their formation.\n\nThe acetyl group, $-COCH_3$, is strongly electron-withdrawing by both the inductive effect ($-I$) and the mesomeric effect ($-M$). In resonance terms, it cannot donate electron density into the ring; instead, it withdraws by conjugation with the ring $\\pi$ system.\n\nFor $I_{ortho}$ and $I_{para}$ (attack ortho or para to the acetyl group), the resonance set of the sigma complex necessarily includes a contributor in which the positive charge is located at the ipso carbon (the ring carbon bearing the substituent). Conjugation between this ipso carbon and the carbonyl group allows further delocalization into the $C=O$ system, producing a resonance contributor in which positive charge is placed on the carbonyl fragment (notably on the carbonyl carbon). Because the carbonyl group is electron-withdrawing, placing positive charge adjacent to or on the carbonyl is strongly destabilizing. Therefore, both $I_{ortho}$ and $I_{para}$ are destabilized by an unfavorable resonance interaction with the $-COCH_3$ group. Between these two, $I_{ortho}$ is further destabilized by steric congestion in the sigma complex due to proximity of the electrophile and the acetyl group, so $I_{para}$ is more stable than $I_{ortho}$.\n\nFor $I_{meta}$ (attack meta to the acetyl group), the resonance structures of the arenium ion do not place positive charge at the ipso position; there is no resonance interaction that would engage the carbonyl $\\pi$ system. Consequently, the destabilizing resonance interaction present in $I_{ortho}$ and $I_{para}$ is avoided, making $I_{meta}$ the most stable of the three.\n\nThus, the stability order is $I_{meta} > I_{para} > I_{ortho}$, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2186598"}, {"introduction": "While electronic effects are the primary determinant of a substituent's directing nature, secondary factors can significantly influence the outcome, especially the ratio of ortho to para products. Steric hindrance, which arises from the physical size of the substituent, can make attack at the nearby ortho positions less favorable. This practice problem [@problem_id:2186573] provides a striking example of how an exceptionally bulky alkyl group can effectively block the ortho positions, leading to overwhelming selectivity for the para product.", "problem": "An unknown liquid aromatic hydrocarbon, designated Compound A, has the molecular formula $C_{10}H_{14}$.

Chemical analysis of the resulting product mixture reveals that a single monobrominated isomer is formed in over 98% yield. Further characterization confirms this major product is the *para*-substituted isomer.\n\nBased on this high degree of regioselectivity, identify the correct chemical identity of Compound A from the options provided below.\n\nA. *n*-Butylbenzene\n\nB. *sec*-Butylbenzene\n\nC.

The regioselectivity is governed by the directing effects of the substituent and by steric hindrance in the formation of the sigma complex and in the transition state.\n\nAll alkyl groups are weakly activating and ortho/para-directing because they donate electron density by hyperconjugation, stabilizing the sigma complexes formed at the ortho and para positions but not at the meta position. Therefore, for alkylbenzenes the principal competition is between ortho and para substitution; meta substitution is disfavored.\n\nThe observed outcome that a single monobrominated isomer is obtained, identified as the para isomer and produced overwhelmingly, implies that ortho substitution is strongly suppressed by steric effects. Steric hindrance at the ortho positions increases with the bulk of the substituent at the ipso carbon. Comparing the options:\n- n-Butylbenzene (primary at the ipso carbon) is relatively unhindered; it typically gives both ortho and para products in significant amounts.\n- Isobutylbenzene (also primary at the ipso carbon, with branching one carbon away) presents more steric bulk than n-butyl but still gives appreciable ortho substitution.\n- sec-Butylbenzene (secondary at the ipso carbon) is bulkier and more para-selective than the primary isomers, but still does not typically suppress ortho substitution to the extent required to yield essentially a single para isomer.\n- tert-Butylbenzene (tertiary at the ipso carbon) is extremely bulky; ortho attack incurs severe steric repulsion in both the transition state and the sigma complex, making para substitution overwhelmingly favored, often to the point of producing effectively only the para isomer.\n\nOption E, p-xylene, is not a monosubstituted benzene derivative and does not match the stated molecular formula $C_{10}H_{14}$; it is therefore incompatible with the problem’s constraints.\n\nThus, the only substituent consistent with the formation of essentially a single para-brominated product under $FeBr_3$-catalyzed bromination is tert-butyl, identifying Compound A as tert-butylbenzene.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2186573"}, {"introduction": "Mastery of directing groups moves beyond simple prediction and into the realm of strategic synthesis, where the properties of functional groups are manipulated to build specific molecules.

Step 2: React the product from Step 1 with methyl chloride ($CH_3Cl$) and aluminum trichloride ($AlCl_3$).", "solution": "Goal: Obtain m-nitrobenzoic acid from toluene by ensuring that the electrophilic aromatic substitution introduces the nitro group meta to the side-chain position. This requires that, at the time of nitration, the ring bears a strongly deactivating, meta-directing substituent (such as a carboxylic acid), not an ortho/para-directing substituent (such as methyl or benzylic groups).\n\nKey principles:\n- Electrophilic aromatic nitration (with nitric acid and sulfuric acid) proceeds via the electrophile nitronium ion and follows substituent directing effects. Alkyl groups are activating and ortho/para-directing; carboxylic acids are deactivating and meta-directing.\n- Benzylic oxidation with hot, concentrated potassium permanganate in aqueous acidic workup converts any benzylic side chain that has at least one benzylic hydrogen into a carboxylic acid, regardless of the side-chain length or functionality compatible with the conditions.\n- Benzylic radical bromination with NBS in the presence of light replaces a benzylic hydrogen with bromine to give a benzyl bromide; the resulting substituent is overall ortho/para-directing due to hyperconjugation from the benzylic carbon, though less activating than methyl.\n- Friedel-Crafts alkylation fails on rings deactivated by strong electron-withdrawing groups such as carboxylic acid; moreover, carboxylic acids coordinate/poison Lewis acids like aluminum trichloride.\n\nEvaluate each option:\n\nA. First nitration of toluene places nitro groups ortho and para to the methyl group because methyl is an ortho/para director. Subsequent oxidation of the methyl group to a carboxyl group does not change the relative positions of substituents on the ring; it simply converts the methyl-bearing carbon into a carboxyl-bearing carbon. Hence the products are o- and p-nitrobenzoic acids, not meta. This sequence does not give m-nitrobenzoic acid as the major product.\n\nB. NBS/light converts toluene to benzyl bromide. The substituent at the ring is then a benzylic carbon bearing bromine (a chloromethyl/chlorobenzyl analog directs similarly). This substituent is ortho/para-directing (via hyperconjugation of the benzylic carbon) though less activating than methyl. Nitration therefore gives o- and p-nitrobenzyl bromides, not the meta isomer. This sequence fails to produce m-nitrobenzoic acid.\n\nC. Oxidation of toluene with hot, concentrated potassium permanganate followed by acidic workup converts the methyl group into a carboxylic acid to give benzoic acid. The carboxyl group is strongly deactivating and meta-directing. Subsequent nitration under nitric acid and sulfuric acid thus places the nitro group meta to the carboxyl group, yielding m-nitrobenzoic acid as the major product. This sequence achieves the goal.\n\nD. Oxidation first gives benzoic acid. Attempted Friedel-Crafts alkylation with methyl chloride and aluminum trichloride fails because the carboxylic acid is a strong deactivator and coordinates to the Lewis acid, preventing electrophilic aromatic substitution. Even if it proceeded, the product would be a methylbenzoic acid, not a nitro compound. Thus this sequence cannot produce m-nitrobenzoic acid.\n\nConclusion: Only option C installs the meta-directing carboxyl group before nitration, ensuring formation of m-nitrobenzoic acid as the major product.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2186596"}]}
