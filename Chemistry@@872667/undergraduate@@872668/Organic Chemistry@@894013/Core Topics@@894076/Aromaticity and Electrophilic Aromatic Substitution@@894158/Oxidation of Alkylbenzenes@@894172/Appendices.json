This first exercise challenges you to identify the limits of this reaction by pinpointing a substrate that will resist oxidation. Successfully solving this requires focusing on the critical requirement of a benzylic hydrogen atom for the reaction to proceed [@problem_id:2187045].", "problem": "The permanganate oxidation of alkylbenzenes is a classic transformation in organic synthesis, used to convert an alkyl side chain on an aromatic ring into a carboxylic acid. The reaction is typically carried out by heating the substrate with an aqueous solution of potassium permanganate ($KMnO_4$), often under basic conditions, followed by an acidic workup. This process is known to be selective, and its success depends on the structure of the alkyl substituent.\n\nAn organic chemist plans to subject several aromatic hydrocarbons to these vigorous oxidative conditions. The goal is to identify which compound, due to its specific molecular structure, will fail to be converted into an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\nFrom the list below, identify the compound that will not undergo oxidation of its alkyl substituent to a carboxylic acid group when treated with hot, aqueous potassium permanganate followed by acidification.\n\nA. 1-tert-Butyl-4-ethylbenzene\n\nB. 1,3,5-Triisopropylbenzene\n\nC. 9,10-Dihydrophenanthrene\n\nD. 1-Adamantylbenzene\n\nE. Indane", "solution": "Fundamental principle: Hot, aqueous, basic $KMnO_{4}$ followed by acidic workup oxidizes an alkyl substituent on an aromatic ring to a carboxylic acid only if the benzylic carbon (the carbon directly attached to the ring) bears at least one hydrogen. If there is at least one benzylic C–H bond, oxidative cleavage of the side chain occurs to give an aryl carboxylate (after workup, the carboxylic acid). If the benzylic carbon has no hydrogens (e.g., is quaternary), oxidation does not proceed under these conditions.\n\nApply this criterion to each option:\n\nA. 1-tert-Butyl-4-ethylbenzene. The ethyl substituent has benzylic hydrogens at the methylene directly attached to the ring, so it is oxidized by $KMnO_{4}$ to give the corresponding carboxyl group at that position. The tert-butyl substituent lacks benzylic hydrogens and remains intact, but the molecule as a whole is converted to an aromatic carboxylic acid (p-tert-butylbenzoic acid). Therefore, A does undergo the oxidation to a carboxylic acid.\n\nB. 1,3,5-Triisopropylbenzene. In each isopropyl group, the benzylic carbon is secondary and bears one hydrogen; such benzylic C–H bonds are oxidized by hot $KMnO_{4}$. Under vigorous conditions, this yields the triacid (1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid). Therefore, B undergoes oxidation to carboxylic acids.\n\nC. 9,10-Dihydrophenanthrene. The 9- and 10-positions are benzylic methylenes bearing benzylic hydrogens. These positions are readily oxidized by $KMnO_{4}$; such systems are well known to undergo benzylic oxidation (often to the corresponding quinone or, under more forcing conditions, to ring-cleaved dicarboxylic acids). The key criterion—presence of benzylic hydrogens—is satisfied, so it does not fail the oxidation requirement.\n\nD. 1-Adamantylbenzene. The carbon of the adamantyl group bonded to the ring is a bridgehead tertiary carbon that, upon substitution, is quaternary at the benzylic position and bears no hydrogens. With no benzylic C–H bond, the necessary initial oxidation cannot occur, so hot $KMnO_{4}$ does not convert this substituent into a carboxyl group. Therefore, D will not be converted into an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\nE. Indane. The saturated ring fused to the benzene contains benzylic methylene groups; hot $KMnO_{4}$ oxidizes such benzylic positions exhaustively to give ortho-dicarboxylation on the aromatic ring (o-phthalic acid). Therefore, E does undergo oxidation to carboxylic acids.\n\nConclusion: The compound that fails to be converted into an aromatic carboxylic acid under these conditions is the one with no benzylic hydrogens at the substituted position, namely 1-adamantylbenzene (D).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2187045"}, {"introduction": "Once the fundamental requirement for oxidation is clear, we can apply the principle to more complex starting materials. This practice asks you to predict the outcome when an aromatic ring bears multiple alkyl side chains.
