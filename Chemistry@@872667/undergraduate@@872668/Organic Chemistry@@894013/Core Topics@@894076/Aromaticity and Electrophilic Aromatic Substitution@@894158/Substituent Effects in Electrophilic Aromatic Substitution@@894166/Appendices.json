This first exercise focuses on a classic case: the nitration of benzonitrile. By analyzing how a strongly electron-withdrawing cyano group influences the reaction, you will practice determining the regioselectivity for deactivating, meta-directing substituents based on the stability of the intermediate arenium ions [@problem_id:2206109].", "problem": "In the synthesis of precursors for advanced materials, precise control over regioselectivity is paramount. A chemist is investigating the functionalization of benzonitrile ($C_6H_5CN$), a common industrial starting material. The reaction involves the electrophilic nitration of benzonitrile by heating it with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid ($HNO_3$) and concentrated sulfuric acid ($H_2SO_4$). Assuming the reaction proceeds to give a single major monosubstituted product, identify this principal organic product from the choices below.\n\nA. 2-Nitrobenzonitrile\n\nB. 4-Nitrobenzonitrile\n\nC. 3-Nitrobenzonitrile\n\nD. A mixture of 2-Nitrobenzonitrile and 4-Nitrobenzonitrile in roughly equal amounts\n\nE. No reaction occurs due to the strong deactivation of the ring", "solution": "Electrophilic nitration of an aromatic ring proceeds via generation of the nitronium ion electrophile, produced under mixed acid conditions:\n$$HNO_3 + 2H_2SO_4 \\rightarrow NO_2^+ + H_3O^+ + 2HSO_4^-$$\nThe aromatic substitution mechanism involves formation of a $\\sigma$-complex (arenium ion) upon attack of the ring on $NO_2^+$, followed by deprotonation to restore aromaticity.\n\nThe substituent $-CN$ in benzonitrile is strongly deactivating due to its $-I$ effect and resonance withdrawal ($-M$), which diminishes ring electron density and slows electrophilic substitution. Importantly, $-CN$ is meta-directing: for ortho or para attack, the $\\sigma$-complex resonance structures include a form with the positive charge located at the carbon bearing the cyano group, which is especially destabilized by the electron-withdrawing $-CN$. In contrast, for meta attack, none of the key resonance forms places the positive charge on the ipso carbon bearing $-CN$, avoiding this destabilization. Therefore, meta substitution is favored despite overall deactivation.\n\nConsequently, under sufficiently strong nitration conditions (heating with concentrated mixed acid), benzonitrile undergoes electrophilic nitration predominantly at the meta position to give 3-nitrobenzonitrile. Thus among the options, the single major monosubstituted product is 3-nitrobenzonitrile.\n\nOptions proposing ortho or para products (A, B) or their mixture (D) are disfavored due to the directing effect of $-CN$, and option E is incorrect because such deactivated rings can still undergo nitration under forcing conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2206109"}, {"introduction": "Building on the principles of individual substituent effects, this next problem introduces a competitive scenario, which is more reflective of real-world synthetic challenges. You will analyze the bromination of a mixture containing both an activated ring (toluene) and a deactivated ring (nitrobenzene) with a limited amount of electrophile. This practice sharpens your ability to compare the relative reactivity of different substituted rings and predict which one will react preferentially [@problem_id:2206084].", "problem": "In a synthetic chemistry laboratory, a student prepares a reaction flask containing an equimolar mixture of toluene and nitrobenzene dissolved in an inert solvent. To this mixture, exactly one molar equivalent of molecular bromine ($Br_2$) is added, followed by a catalytic amount of anhydrous iron(III) bromide ($FeBr_3$). The reaction is allowed to proceed to completion at room temperature. Assuming the reaction yields are high, which of the following options best describes the major organic product(s) that would be isolated from the reaction mixture?\n\nA. 3-Bromonitrobenzene\n\nB. A mixture of 2-bromotoluene and 4-bromotoluene\n\nC. (Bromomethyl)benzene\n\nD. A mixture of 4-bromotoluene and 3-bromonitrobenzene\n\nE. 3-Bromotoluene", "solution": "This problem requires an understanding of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), specifically the directing and activating/deactivating effects of substituents on a benzene ring in a competitive reaction scenario.\n\nStep 1: Identify the reaction type and the electrophile.\nThe reagents are molecular bromine ($Br_2$) and a Lewis acid catalyst, iron(III) bromide ($FeBr_3$). This combination is characteristic of an electrophilic aromatic bromination reaction. The catalyst polarizes the $Br-Br$ bond, generating a potent electrophile, the bromonium ion ($Br^+$) or a complex that functions as its equivalent ([Br-Br-FeBr_3]^-).\n$$Br_2 + FeBr_3 \\rightleftharpoons Br^+ + FeBr_4^-$$\n\nStep 2: Analyze the substrates and their substituents.\nThe reaction mixture contains two aromatic substrates: toluene and nitrobenzene.\n- Toluene has a methyl group ($-CH_3$) attached to the benzene ring.\n- Nitrobenzene has a nitro group ($-NO_2$) attached to the benzene ring.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the effect of each substituent on the reactivity of the aromatic ring.\nThe rate of electrophilic aromatic substitution is determined by the electron density of the aromatic ring. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) increase the electron density, making the ring more nucleophilic and thus more reactive towards electrophiles. They are called \"activating\" groups. Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) decrease the electron density, making the ring less nucleophilic and less reactive. They are called \"deactivating\" groups.\n- The methyl group ($-CH_3$) in toluene is an EDG, primarily through hyperconjugation and weak inductive effects. Therefore, the methyl group is an **activating group**. It makes the toluene ring significantly more reactive than unsubstituted benzene.\n- The nitro group ($-NO_2$) in nitrobenzene is a strong EWG due to both strong inductive and resonance effects. Therefore, the nitro group is a strong **deactivating group**. It makes the nitrobenzene ring vastly less reactive than unsubstituted benzene.\n\nStep 4: Compare the relative rates of reaction for the two substrates.\nSince toluene is activated and nitrobenzene is strongly deactivated, the rate of bromination for toluene is many orders of magnitude faster than the rate of bromination for nitrobenzene. The electrophile ($Br^+$) will react preferentially with the more nucleophilic (i.e., more activated) ring.\n\nStep 5: Consider the stoichiometry of the reaction.\nThe problem states that only one molar equivalent of $Br_2$ is used for an equimolar mixture of the two substrates. This means there is only enough electrophile to react with half of the total aromatic molecules present. Due to the vast difference in reaction rates, the limited amount of electrophile will react almost exclusively with the much more reactive substrate, which is toluene. Negligible amounts of brominated nitrobenzene will be formed.\n\nStep 6: Determine the regioselectivity of the reaction with toluene.\nNow that we have established that toluene is the substrate that reacts, we must determine where the bromine atom will add to the ring. This is governed by the directing effect of the substituent.\n- The methyl group ($-CH_3$) is an **ortho, para-director**. It stabilizes the carbocation intermediates formed during electrophilic attack at the ortho and para positions through resonance and hyperconjugation.\n- Therefore, the bromination of toluene will yield a mixture of the ortho-substituted product (2-bromotoluene) and the para-substituted product (4-bromotoluene). The meta-substituted product (3-bromotoluene) is not formed in any significant quantity. Typically, the para isomer is the major product of the two due to reduced steric hindrance compared to the ortho position.\n\nStep 7: Evaluate the given options.\n- A. 3-Bromonitrobenzene: This would be the product if nitrobenzene reacted. This is incorrect because nitrobenzene is highly deactivated and will not compete effectively with toluene.\n- B. A mixture of 2-bromotoluene and 4-bromotoluene: This correctly identifies that the activated substrate, toluene, reacts and that the reaction gives the expected ortho and para products. Both are considered the major products of the reaction in the sense that they are formed in high yield relative to any other possible product.\n- C. (Bromomethyl)benzene: This is the product of benzylic bromination, which typically occurs under radical conditions (e.g., using N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) with light or a radical initiator), not under EAS conditions with a Lewis acid catalyst.\n- D. A mixture of 4-bromotoluene and 3-bromonitrobenzene: This incorrectly suggests that a significant amount of both substrates react. Given the huge rate difference, this is not the case.\n- E. 3-Bromotoluene: This is the meta-isomer. The methyl group is an ortho, para-director, so this product is not formed.\n\nBased on this analysis, the major organic products will be the ortho and para isomers of bromotoluene. Option B is the best description of this outcome.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2206084"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice advances to the more complex, yet common, situation of disubstituted aromatic rings. This exercise requires you to predict the outcome of electrophilic attack on both 1,3-dimethylbenzene and 1,3-dinitrobenzene. You will learn to determine how the directing effects of multiple substituents on the same ring can reinforce one another to guide the position of an incoming group, a critical skill for multi-step organic synthesis [@problem_id:2206074].", "problem": "In the field of synthetic organic chemistry, understanding how existing substituents on an aromatic ring influence the position of a new incoming group is crucial for reaction design. This phenomenon is known as the directing effect. Consider two separate electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions where a generic electrophile, represented as $E^+$, is introduced to two different starting materials: 1,3-dimethylbenzene and 1,3-dinitrobenzene. For both reactions, we are interested in the major organic product formed after the addition of a single electrophile (monosubstitution).\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate analysis of the substituent directing effects and the resulting major product for both reactions?\n\nA. In 1,3-dimethylbenzene, the methyl groups are activating ortho,para-directors whose effects reinforce to direct the electrophile to position 5, the most sterically accessible site. In 1,3-dinitrobenzene, the nitro groups are deactivating meta-directors, and their reinforcing effects also direct the electrophile to position 5.\n\nB. In 1,3-dimethylbenzene, the methyl groups are activating ortho,para-directors, but their effects conflict, leading to a mixture of products with no clear major isomer. In 1,3-dinitrobenzene, the nitro groups are deactivating meta-directors, and their reinforcing effects direct the electrophile to either position 4 or 6.\n\nC. In 1,3-dimethylbenzene, the methyl groups are activating ortho,para-directors whose effects reinforce to activate positions 2, 4, and 6. The major product is the 2-substituted isomer due to its high electronic activation. In 1,3-dinitrobenzene, the nitro groups are deactivating meta-directors, and their reinforcing effects direct the electrophile to position 2.\n\nD. In 1,3-dimethylbenzene, the methyl groups are activating ortho,para-directors whose effects reinforce to activate positions 2, 4, and 6, with the 4-substituted isomer typically predominating due to reduced steric hindrance. In 1,3-dinitrobenzene, the nitro groups are deactivating meta-directors, whose effects reinforce to direct the electrophile to position 5.\n\nE. In 1,3-dimethylbenzene, the methyl groups direct the electrophile to position 2, while the nitro groups in 1,3-dinitrobenzene direct the electrophile to position 4. The reaction with 1,3-dinitrobenzene is significantly faster due to the strong inductive effect of the nitro groups.", "solution": "Electrophilic aromatic substitution site selectivity is governed by the directing effects of substituents through inductive and resonance interactions. Alkyl groups donate electron density by hyperconjugation and inductive effects, activating the ring and directing incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. Nitro groups withdraw electron density by both inductive and resonance effects, strongly deactivating the ring and directing incoming electrophiles to the meta positions.\n\nFor 1,3-dimethylbenzene (meta-xylene), each methyl group is an activating ortho,para-director. Relative to the methyl at position 1, the activated positions are 2, 4, and 6. Relative to the methyl at position 3, the activated positions are also 2, 4, and 6. Therefore, the directing effects reinforce at positions 2, 4, and 6. Among these, position 2 is ortho to both methyl groups and is the most sterically hindered. Positions 4 and 6 are each ortho to only one methyl group and para to the other, and they are symmetry-equivalent in 1,3-disubstitution with identical groups. Consequently, the 4-substituted (equivalently 6-substituted) isomer typically predominates due to reduced steric hindrance.\n\nFor 1,3-dinitrobenzene, each nitro group is a deactivating meta-director. Relative to the nitro at position 1, the meta positions are 3 and 5; relative to the nitro at position 3, the meta positions are 1 and 5. The only unsubstituted position that is meta to both nitro groups is position 5. Positions 2, 4, and 6 are ortho or para to at least one nitro group and are therefore strongly disfavored electronically. Although the ring is strongly deactivated overall (and the reaction is slow), if substitution occurs, it will be directed to position 5.\n\nThese analyses match the statement that in 1,3-dimethylbenzene the methyl groups reinforce to activate positions 2, 4, and 6, with the 4-substituted isomer predominating due to lower steric hindrance, and in 1,3-dinitrobenzene the nitro groups reinforce to direct to position 5.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2206074"}]}
