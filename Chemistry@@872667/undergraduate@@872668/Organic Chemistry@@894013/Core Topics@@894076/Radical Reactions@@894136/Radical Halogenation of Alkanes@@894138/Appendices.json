Its nonequivalent carbon environments (and hydrogen sets) are:\n- The two methyl groups directly attached to C2 are equivalent by molecular symmetry; their six primary hydrogens form one set, giving one primary chloride (e.g., 1-chloro-2-methylbutane).\n- The terminal methyl at the far end (on C4) is a different environment; its three primary hydrogens form a second set, giving a second primary chloride (e.g., 1-chloro-3-methylbutane).\n- The methylene group at C3 has two equivalent secondary hydrogens, forming a third set, giving one secondary chloride (e.g., 2-chloro-3-methylbutane).\n- The tertiary hydrogen at C2 (on the carbon bearing three carbon substituents) forms a fourth, unique set, giving one tertiary chloride (e.g., 2-chloro-2-methylbutane).\n\nThus there are exactly four distinct monochlorination sites, hence four unique constitutional isomers.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2193386"}, {"introduction": "Simply knowing the possible products isn't enough; in synthesis, we often want to predict which one will be the major product.
