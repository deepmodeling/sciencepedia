The transformation is shown below:\n\nStarting Material: 2-methyl-1-butene\nTarget Product: 1-bromo-2-methylbutane\n\nWhich of the following sets of reagents will successfully accomplish this specific transformation as the major product?\n\nA. Hydrogen bromide (HBr) in the presence of a peroxide (ROOR) and heat.\nB. Hydrogen bromide (HBr) in diethyl ether.\nC. Bromine (Br$_{2}$) in carbon tetrachloride (CCl$_{4}$).\nD. Hydrogen chloride (HCl) in the presence of a peroxide (ROOR) and heat.\nE. Sodium bromide (NaBr) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).", "solution": "We need to install a bromine at the terminal carbon (C1) of 2-methyl-1-butene to form 1-bromo-2-methylbutane. This requires anti-Markovnikov addition of HBr across the alkene so that Br ends up on the less substituted carbon.\n\nKey principle: The peroxide (Kharasch) effect applies specifically to HBr under radical conditions (ROOR, heat), giving anti-Markovnikov addition. Mechanistically:\n- Initiation: Peroxide homolysis generates radicals; an alkoxy radical abstracts H from HBr to form a bromine radical.\n- Propagation step 1: The bromine radical adds to the terminal carbon of the alkene to generate the more stable secondary radical at C2 (regioselectivity arises because adding Br to the less substituted carbon places the radical on the more substituted carbon).\n- Propagation step 2: The carbon radical abstracts H from HBr, yielding 1-bromo-2-methylbutane and regenerating a bromine radical, sustaining the chain.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A. HBr with ROOR and heat: Radical anti-Markovnikov addition of HBr places Br at C1, giving 1-bromo-2-methylbutane as the major product. This matches the target.\n- B. HBr in diethyl ether: Ionic, Markovnikov hydrobromination; Br adds to the more substituted carbon (C2), giving 2-bromo-2-methylbutane, not the target.\n- C. Br$_{2}$ in CCl$_{4}$: Electrophilic addition of Br$_{2}$ gives a vicinal dibromide, not the target.\n- D. HCl with ROOR and heat: The peroxide effect does not operate with HCl; radical chain is not favorable, and ionic Markovnikov addition would give a chloro product at C2, not the target.\n- E. NaBr in DMSO: No suitable leaving group or radical initiator; no reaction to give the desired alkyl bromide from an alkene.\n\nTherefore, only option A accomplishes the specified transformation as the major product.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2193128"}, {"introduction": "Building on the previous example, this problem presents a realistic laboratory scenario: an experiment that yielded an unexpected product. By diagnosing why a reaction produced the Markovnikov isomer instead of the intended anti-Markovnikov product, you will reinforce your understanding of the critical role of radical initiators. This practice [@problem_id:2193065] hones the essential skill of troubleshooting a chemical synthesis by connecting observed outcomes to underlying mechanistic pathways.", "problem": "An undergraduate researcher is tasked with preparing 1-bromo-3-methylbutane from 3-methyl-1-butene as part of a multi-step synthesis. The standard laboratory protocol for this transformation involves reacting the alkene with hydrogen bromide. After performing the reaction and purifying the product, the student analyzes the sample using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). The analysis reveals that the major product obtained is not the desired 1-bromo-3-methylbutane, but rather its isomer, 2-bromo-3-methylbutane.\n\nAssuming the student started with pure 3-methyl-1-butene and correctly identified the major product, which of the following procedural errors most plausibly explains this outcome?\n\nA. The student omitted a necessary radical initiator, such as dibenzoyl peroxide, from the reaction mixture.\nB. The student performed the reaction in a quartz flask exposed to ambient laboratory light, rather than in a light-proof amber glass flask.\nC. The student used a catalyst of platinized charcoal, which is known to cause skeletal rearrangements.\nD. The student accidentally used a solution of HBr in acetic acid instead of anhydrous HBr gas.\nE. The starting 3-methyl-1-butene was contaminated with its isomer, 2-methyl-1-butene.", "solution": "We first identify the structures and the regiochemical outcomes. The starting alkene is 3-methyl-1-butene, which can be written as $\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{=CH-CH(CH}_{3}\\text{)-CH}_{3}$. The desired product, 1-bromo-3-methylbutane, corresponds to anti-Markovnikov addition of $\\text{HBr}$, placing $Br$ at the terminal carbon to give $\\text{Br-CH}_{2}\\text{-CH}_{2}\\text{-CH(CH}_{3}\\text{)-CH}_{3}$. The observed major product, 2-bromo-3-methylbutane, corresponds to Markovnikov addition, $\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{-CH(Br)-CH(CH}_{3}\\text{)-CH}_{3}$.\n\nPrinciple 1 (ionic hydrohalogenation): In the absence of radical initiators, addition of $\\text{HX}$ to an alkene proceeds via electrophilic addition with carbocation intermediates, giving Markovnikov regiochemistry because the more substituted carbocation is lower in energy. Applying this to $\\text{HBr}$ and $\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{=CH-CH(CH}_{3}\\text{)-CH}_{3}$:\n- Protonation step forms the more stable secondary carbocation at $C2$:\n$$ \\text{CH}_{2}\\text{=CH-CH(CH}_{3}\\text{)-CH}_{3} + \\text{HBr} \\to \\text{CH}_{3}\\text{-}\\overset{+}{\\text{C}}\\text{H-CH(CH}_{3}\\text{)-CH}_{3} + \\text{Br}^{-} $$\n- Nucleophilic capture by $\\text{Br}^{-}$ then gives the Markovnikov product:\n$$ \\text{CH}_{3}\\text{-}\\overset{+}{\\text{C}}\\text{H-CH(CH}_{3}\\text{)-CH}_{3} + \\text{Br}^{-} \\to \\text{CH}_{3}\\text{-CH(Br)-CH(CH}_{3}\\text{)-CH}_{3} $$\nThus, without radicals, the major product is 2-bromo-3-methylbutane, matching the observation.\n\nPrinciple 2 (radical hydrobromination): Anti-Markovnikov addition of $\\text{HBr}$ occurs via a radical chain mechanism that requires initiation (peroxides and/or light) to generate $\\text{Br}\\cdot$. The chain steps are:\n- Initiation:\n$$ \\mathrm{ROOR} \\xrightarrow{\\Delta \\text{ or } h\\nu} 2\\,\\mathrm{RO\\cdot}, \\quad \\mathrm{RO\\cdot} + \\text{HBr} \\to \\mathrm{ROH} + \\text{Br}\\cdot $$\n- Propagation:\n$$ \\text{Br}\\cdot + \\text{CH}_{2}\\text{=CH-CH(CH}_{3}\\text{)-CH}_{3} \\to \\text{Br-CH}_{2}\\text{-}\\dot{\\text{C}}\\text{H-CH(CH}_{3}\\text{)-CH}_{3} $$\nplacing the radical at the more substituted carbon,\n$$ \\text{Br-CH}_{2}\\text{-}\\dot{\\text{C}}\\text{H-CH(CH}_{3}\\text{)-CH}_{3} + \\text{HBr} \\to \\text{Br-CH}_{2}\\text{-CH}_{2}\\text{-CH(CH}_{3}\\text{)-CH}_{3} + \\text{Br}\\cdot $$\nThis pathway gives the desired 1-bromo-3-methylbutane. Therefore, to obtain the desired product, a radical initiator (or effective photoinitiation) is required.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A. Omitting a radical initiator prevents the radical chain pathway, forcing the reaction to proceed via the ionic mechanism, which yields the observed Markovnikov product, 2-bromo-3-methylbutane. This directly and plausibly explains the outcome.\n- B. Performing the reaction in quartz under ambient light would facilitate radical formation, favoring the anti-Markovnikov product. This would promote formation of the desired 1-bromo-3-methylbutane, not the observed 2-bromo isomer, so it does not explain the outcome.\n- C. Platinized charcoal typically catalyzes hydrogenation with $H_{2}$; it is not used for hydrohalogenation and does not plausibly cause this specific Markovnikov outcome without additional reagents. Skeletal rearrangements are not necessary to explain the observed simple Markovnikov product.\n- D. Using $\\text{HBr}$ in acetic acid instead of anhydrous gas does not invert the regiochemistry to anti-Markovnikov; the ionic mechanism still dominates, giving Markovnikov addition. While this condition is consistent with the observed product, it does not specifically account for why the anti-Markovnikov product was not formed; the crucial factor is the absence of a radical initiator. Thus it is less directly explanatory than A.\n- E. Contamination with 2-methyl-1-butene would not selectively produce 2-bromo-3-methylbutane from 3-methyl-1-butene; the products and regiochemistry would differ, and this does not straightforwardly explain the observed outcome as the major product from a pure starting alkene.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible procedural error that explains obtaining 2-bromo-3-methylbutane as the major product is omission of the radical initiator necessary for anti-Markovnikov hydrobromination.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2193065"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice pushes beyond simple rule application to test your conceptual understanding. We explore the reaction of $HBr$ with a symmetrically substituted alkene, a special case where the typical rules of regioselectivity lead to a surprising conclusion. Analyzing this scenario [@problem_id:2193119] will challenge you to think critically about the structural basis for the Markovnikov and anti-Markovnikov effects, solidifying your grasp of why these rules work.", "problem": "An organic chemistry student is investigating the hydrobromination of alkenes under different conditions. The student reacts 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene with an excess of hydrogen bromide (HBr) in the presence of a catalytic amount of a generic organic peroxide (ROOR). After allowing the reaction to proceed to completion, the student isolates and characterizes the resulting product mixture.\n\nWhich of the following options most accurately describes the major organic product and the outcome of this specific reaction?\n\nA. The major product is 1-bromo-2,3-dimethylbutane, formed via a standard anti-Markovnikov addition.\nB. The reaction yields a nearly 1:1 mixture of 2-bromo-2,3-dimethylbutane and 2-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane.\nC. The major product is 2-bromo-2,3-dimethylbutane, which is the same product that would form if the reaction were conducted in the absence of peroxides.\nD. The reaction fails to proceed at an appreciable rate because the alkene is too sterically hindered for the initial radical addition to occur.\nE. The major product is 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane, a result of a radical-induced rearrangement.", "solution": "Identify the substrate and symmetry: 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene is tetramethylethylene. The double bond is between two identical, fully substituted (tertiary) carbons. By symmetry, the two alkene carbons are equivalent.\n\nState the mechanistic regime: In the presence of ROOR, HBr adds to alkenes via a radical chain (Kharasch effect), giving anti-Markovnikov regioselectivity. The relevant steps are:\n- Initiation: homolysis of ROOR to give alkoxy radicals, followed by hydrogen abstraction from HBr to generate a bromine radical.\n- Propagation step 1: a Br radical adds to the alkene to form a carbon-centered radical. Regioselectivity arises from forming the more stable (more substituted) radical.\n- Propagation step 2: the carbon radical abstracts hydrogen from HBr to furnish the alkyl bromide and regenerate a Br radical.\n\nApply regioselectivity to this substrate: For 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene, addition of Br radical to either alkene carbon leads to the same tertiary radical on the other carbon because both alkene carbons are equivalent by symmetry. Consequently, there is a single constitutional product with bromine on either alkene carbon, but these positions are identical, yielding one product: 2-bromo-2,3-dimethylbutane.\n\nCompare with ionic (no-peroxide) addition: Without peroxides, HBr adds via an ionic, Markovnikov pathway. Protonation of this symmetric, tetrasubstituted alkene forms the same tertiary carbocation regardless of which alkene carbon is protonated, and subsequent attack by bromide gives the same product. Thus, the product obtained in the radical pathway is the same as that obtained in the ionic pathway.\n\nExclude the distractors:\n- Anti-Markovnikov placement at a terminal carbon (1-bromo-2,3-dimethylbutane) does not occur; there is no terminal site involved without rearrangement, and none is needed here.\n- A mixture implying distinct regioisomers (such as 2-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane) would require rearrangement or inequivalent alkene carbons; the substrate is symmetric and does not favor multiple constitutional isomers.\n- Steric hindrance may affect rate but does not prevent radical addition; moreover, the ionic pathway is known to proceed readily for such alkenes, and under radical conditions the stable tertiary radical intermediate forms without difficulty.\n- Radical-induced rearrangements are unnecessary because the initially formed radical is already tertiary and optimally stabilized; hence rearranged products like 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane are not favored.\n\nConclusion: The major product is 2-bromo-2,3-dimethylbutane, and it is the same product obtained in the absence of peroxides.
