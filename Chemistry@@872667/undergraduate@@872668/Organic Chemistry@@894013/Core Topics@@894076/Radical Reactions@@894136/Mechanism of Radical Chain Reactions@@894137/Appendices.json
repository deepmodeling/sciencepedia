In typical radical halogenations, diastereofacial selectivity at a distant stereocenter is small, so addition from the two faces occurs with essentially equal probability, giving an approximately 1:1 mixture of the two diastereomers.\n\nTherefore, the abstraction at C3 followed by bromination yields a pair of diastereomers in an essentially 1:1 ratio, not a single stereoisomer, not a pair of enantiomers, not a significantly biased diastereomeric ratio, and not a rearranged constitutional isomer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2183441"}]}
