There is a symmetry plane through the central carbon, so the two terminal $\\text{CH}_2$ groups are chemically equivalent to each other. Within each $\\text{CH}_2$, the two protons are enantiotopic in an achiral medium and thus chemically equivalent, so each $\\text{CH}_2$ gives a single signal. Therefore, there are two distinct proton environments: the two equivalent terminal $\\text{CH}_2$ groups (total of 4 H) and the central $\\text{CH}_2$ group (2 H). The relative integration is thus $4:2$, which simplifies to $2:1$.\n\nFor splitting, apply the first-order $n+1$ rule: if a set of protons couples to $n$ equivalent neighboring protons, the multiplicity is $n+1$.\n\n- Terminal $\\text{CH}_2$ protons: each terminal $\\text{CH}_2$ is vicinally coupled to the central $\\text{CH}_2$ that has $n=2$ equivalent protons, so the multiplicity is $n+1=3$ (a triplet). Because the two terminal $\\text{CH}_2$ groups are equivalent and not appreciably coupled to each other over five bonds, they appear as a single triplet integrating to 4 H, i.e., relative integration $2$.\n\n- Central $\\text{CH}_2$ protons: the central $\\text{CH}_2$ is vicinally coupled to two equivalent terminal $\\text{CH}_2$ groups, giving a total of $n=4$ equivalent neighboring protons (2 on the left and 2 on the right). Symmetry ensures equal coupling constants to both sides, so the multiplicity is $n+1=5$ (a quintet). This signal integrates to 2 H, i.e., relative integration $1$.\n\nGeminal coupling within each $\\text{CH}_2$ does not lead to additional splitting because the two protons are chemically and magnetically equivalent; longer-range couplings are negligible under the stated first-order conditions.\n\nHence, the expected ${}^1\\text{H}$ NMR spectrum consists of two signals: a triplet with relative integration $2$ (terminal $\\text{CH}_2$ protons) and a quintet with relative integration $1$ (central $\\text{CH}_2$ protons).

Since the total integration is $6$ and all hydrogen atoms in the molecule sum to $6$, all protons are accounted for by two sets of equivalent $3$-proton groups. This strongly implies two methyl groups ($\\text{CH}_3$) and that the third carbon bears no hydrogens (consistent with a carbonyl carbon).\n\nA singlet at $\\delta\\approx 3.7$ integrating to $3$ protons is characteristic of a methoxy group $\\text{O-CH}_3$, where coupling to neighboring protons is absent because the adjacent atom is oxygen (no vicinal H). A singlet at $\\delta\\approx 2.1$ integrating to $3$ protons is characteristic of an acetyl methyl $\\text{CO-CH}_3$, which is also a singlet because the adjacent carbonyl carbon has no attached hydrogens.

We determine the structure as follows.\n\nFirst, compute the degree of unsaturation (index of hydrogen deficiency) from the molecular formula:\n$$\n\\text{DU}=\\frac{2C+2-H}{2}=\\frac{2\\times 4+2-8}{2}=\\frac{10-8}{2}=1.\n$$\nThus the compound contains one ring or one double bond.

A 2H quartet indicates a methylene -$\\text{CH}_2$- coupled to three equivalent protons (an adjacent methyl group), by the $n+1$ rule. The chemical shift near $\\delta \\approx 2.3$ ppm indicates the $\\text{CH}_2$ is alpha to a carbonyl, i.e., -$\\text{CO-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_3$.\n- Signal C: triplet at $\\delta=1.15$ ppm (3H).
