The chemical shift value is a sensitive probe of local electron density, which is influenced by factors like electronegativity and induction. This exercise challenges you to compare two similar molecules and apply the principle of inductive effects to predict which set of protons will be more deshielded and thus resonate further downfield. [@problem_id:2159373]", "problem": "In Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) spectroscopy, the chemical shift ($\\delta$) of a proton is highly sensitive to its local electronic environment. Electronegative atoms can withdraw electron density from nearby protons, an effect known as deshielding, which results in a higher chemical shift value (a downfield shift). Consider the structures of ethanol ($\\mathrm{CH}_3\\mathrm{CH}_2\\mathrm{OH}$) and diethyl ether ($\\mathrm{CH}_3\\mathrm{CH}_2\\mathrm{OCH}_2\\mathrm{CH}_3$). Your task is to compare the expected ¹H NMR chemical shift of the methylene protons ($-\\mathrm{CH}_2-$) directly bonded to the oxygen atom in each molecule. These are often referred to as the $\\alpha$-protons.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately compares the chemical shift of the $\\alpha$-protons in ethanol versus diethyl ether and provides the correct reasoning?\n\nA. The $\\alpha$-protons of ethanol will have a higher chemical shift (be more deshielded) than those of diethyl ether. This is because the electron-donating nature of the second alkyl group in the ether makes its oxygen slightly less electron-withdrawing than the oxygen in the alcohol's hydroxyl group.\n\nB. The $\\alpha$-protons of diethyl ether will have a higher chemical shift (be more deshielded) than those of ethanol. This is because the presence of two alkyl groups attached to the oxygen in the ether enhances its ability to withdraw electron density.\n\nC. The chemical shifts of the $\\alpha$-protons in both molecules will be virtually identical, as they are both attached to a carbon bonded to an oxygen atom, making the inductive effects the same.\n\nD. The $\\alpha$-protons of ethanol will have a higher chemical shift primarily because the hydroxyl proton ($-\\mathrm{OH}$) can participate in hydrogen bonding, which significantly deshields the neighboring methylene group protons.", "solution": "In ¹H NMR, a proton’s resonance frequency depends on the effective magnetic field at the nucleus, given by $B_{\\mathrm{eff}} = B_{0}\\left(1 - \\sigma\\right)$, where $\\sigma$ is the electronic shielding constant. The resonance frequency is $\\nu = \\frac{\\gamma B_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{2\\pi} = \\frac{\\gamma B_{0}}{2\\pi}\\left(1 - \\sigma\\right)$, so a decrease in $\\sigma$ (deshielding) increases $\\nu$. The chemical shift relative to a reference is\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{\\nu - \\nu_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{\\nu_{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\times 10^{6},\n$$\nand, to first order, $\\delta$ increases as $\\sigma$ decreases. Therefore, more electron-withdrawing environments reduce $\\sigma$ and produce higher $\\delta$ for nearby protons.\n\nFor $\\alpha$-protons next to oxygen, the electronegativity of oxygen withdraws electron density inductively from the adjacent carbon, lowering $\\sigma_{\\alpha}$ and increasing $\\delta_{\\alpha}$. Comparing ethanol ($\\mathrm{CH_{3}CH_{2}OH}$) with diethyl ether ($\\mathrm{CH_{3}CH_{2}OCH_{2}CH_{3}}$), the key difference is the substituents on oxygen:\n- In ethanol, oxygen is bound to hydrogen. Hydrogen does not donate electron density by the inductive effect; thus, the oxygen remains relatively electron-withdrawing, causing stronger deshielding of the adjacent $\\alpha$-methylene protons. Symbolically, this corresponds to a smaller $\\sigma_{\\alpha,\\mathrm{EtOH}}$ and hence a larger $\\delta_{\\alpha,\\mathrm{EtOH}}$.\n- In diethyl ether, oxygen is bound to two alkyl groups. Alkyl groups are net electron-donating via the inductive effect, which partially offsets oxygen’s electron-withdrawing tendency. This increases the local shielding at the adjacent $\\alpha$-methylene protons, so $\\sigma_{\\alpha,\\mathrm{Et_{2}O}}  \\sigma_{\\alpha,\\mathrm{EtOH}}$ and therefore $\\delta_{\\alpha,\\mathrm{Et_{2}O}}  \\delta_{\\alpha,\\mathrm{EtOH}}$.\n\nHydrogen bonding strongly affects the chemical shift of the hydroxyl proton itself, but its effect on the neighboring $\\alpha$-methylene protons is comparatively small and not the primary determinant when comparing an alcohol to an ether. Hence the dominant factor is the difference in inductive effects due to the substituents on oxygen.\n\nTherefore, the correct comparison is\n$$\n\\delta_{\\alpha,\\mathrm{EtOH}}  \\delta_{\\alpha,\\mathrm{Et_{2}O}},\n$$\nwith the reasoning that the second alkyl group in the ether donates electron density and makes the ether oxygen less electron-withdrawing than the alcohol’s hydroxyl oxygen.\n\nOption analysis:\n- A correctly states both the trend and the inductive reasoning.\n- B incorrectly claims enhanced electron withdrawal by two alkyl groups; alkyl groups are inductively donating.\n- C ignores the differing substituents on oxygen and thus different inductive effects.\n- D overstates hydrogen bonding as the primary cause for the $\\alpha$-methylene shift; it is not the dominant factor compared to the inductive difference.\n\nThus, A is the most accurate statement and reasoning.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2159373"}, {"introduction": "NMR spectroscopy offers a unique window into dynamic chemical processes, such as conformational changes or rapid rearrangements, that occur on a timescale comparable to the experiment itself.
