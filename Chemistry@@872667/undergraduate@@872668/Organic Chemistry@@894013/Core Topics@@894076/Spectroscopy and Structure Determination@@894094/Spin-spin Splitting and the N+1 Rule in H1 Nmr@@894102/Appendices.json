The structure can be represented as $\\text{Cl}-\\text{CH}_2(\\text{C1})-\\text{CH}_2(\\text{C2})-\\text{CH}_2(\\text{C3})-\\text{Cl}$.\n\nNext, we identify the adjacent carbons and the protons attached to them. The central $\\text{CH}_2$ group at C2 is adjacent to the $\\text{CH}_2$ group at C1 and the $\\text{CH}_2$ group at C3.\n\nThe protons on C1 and C3 are the \"neighbors\" that will cause the splitting of the C2 proton signal. There are two protons on C1 and two protons on C3.\n\nThe crucial step is to determine if these neighboring protons are chemically equivalent to each other. The molecule 1,3-dichloropropane is symmetrical. There is a plane of symmetry and a $C_2$ rotational axis passing through the central C2 carbon. This symmetry makes the two terminal $\\text{CH}_2\\text{Cl}$ groups (at C1 and C3) chemically equivalent. Consequently, the two protons on C1 are equivalent to the two protons on C3.\n\nTherefore, the central $\\text{CH}_2$ group has a total of $n = 2 + 2 = 4$ chemically equivalent neighboring protons.\n\nNow we apply the $n+1$ rule to determine the multiplicity of the signal for the C2 protons:\nMultiplicity = $n + 1$\nMultiplicity = $4 + 1 = 5$\n\nA signal that is split into 5 peaks is called a quintet.\n\nLet's analyze the incorrect options:\nA. A singlet would result if there were no neighboring protons ($n=0$). This is incorrect as there are four neighboring protons.\nB. A triplet would result if there were two neighboring protons ($n=2$). This would be the case if the C2 protons only coupled to one of the adjacent $\\text{CH}_2$ groups, which is incorrect.\nD. A triplet of triplets would result if the two adjacent $\\text{CH}_2$ groups were chemically non-equivalent. In that case, the C2 protons would be split into a triplet by the two protons of the first group ($n=2, 2+1=3$), and each peak of that triplet would be further split into another triplet by the two protons of the second group ($n=2, 2+1=3$).
