When a carbonyl-containing molecule like a ketone is analyzed using electron ionization mass spectrometry, it forms a molecular ion that readily fragments. One of the most important fragmentation pathways for ketones is alpha-cleavage. This process involves the homolytic cleavage of a carbon-carbon bond adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl group. This cleavage results in the formation of a neutral radical and a positively charged acylium ion ($[R-C=O]^+$), which is then detected by the mass spectrometer.\n\nConsider a sample that is an equimolar mixture of two constitutional isomers: 2-pentanone and 3-pentanone.

The base peak corresponds to the most stable fragment cation formed during mass spectrometry. We will analyze the fragmentation of each compound separately. The fragmentation pathway suggested is benzylic cleavage, which is the loss of a methyl radical.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the fragmentation of ethylbenzene.\nThe molar mass of ethylbenzene ($C_8H_{10}$) is $8 \\times 12.01 + 10 \\times 1.01 \\approx 106.1$ amu. The molecular ion ($M^{+\\bullet}$) will have a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 106 (using integer masses for C=12 and H=1).\nThe molecular ion is $[C_6H_5CH_2CH_3]^{+\\bullet}$.\nBenzylic cleavage involves the loss of a methyl radical ($\\cdot CH_3$, mass = 15 amu) to form a benzyl cation.\n$$[C_6H_5CH_2CH_3]^{+\\bullet} \\rightarrow [C_6H_5CH_2]^+ + \\cdot CH_3$$\nThe m/z of the resulting cation, $[C_7H_7]^+$, is $106 - 15 = 91$.\nThis benzyl cation is known to rearrange into the highly stable tropylium ion. The tropylium ion is a seven-membered carbon ring with 6 $\\pi$ electrons, fulfilling Hückel's criteria for aromaticity (4n+2, with n=1). This exceptional stability means that the $[C_7H_7]^+$ ion is formed in very high abundance. It is the most stable cation that can be easily formed from ethylbenzene, and thus, the peak at m/z 91 is the base peak for ethylbenzene.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the fragmentation of p-ethylphenol.\nThe molar mass of p-ethylphenol ($C_8H_{10}O$) is $8 \\times 12.01 + 10 \\times 1.01 + 16.00 \\approx 122.1$ amu. The molecular ion ($M^{+\\bullet}$) will have an m/z of 122.\nThe molecular ion is $[HOC_6H_4CH_2CH_3]^{+\\bullet}$.\nFollowing the same benzylic cleavage pathway, this molecular ion loses a methyl radical ($\\cdot CH_3$).\n$$[HOC_6H_4CH_2CH_3]^{+\\bullet} \\rightarrow [HOC_6H_4CH_2]^+ + \\cdot CH_3$$\nThe m/z of the resulting cation, $[C_7H_7O]^+$, is $122 - 15 = 107$.\nThis cation is a p-hydroxybenzyl cation. Let's analyze its stability. The positive charge on the benzylic carbon is delocalized through resonance with the aromatic ring, similar to the benzyl cation. However, there is an additional, powerful stabilizing factor: the lone pair of electrons on the para-hydroxyl oxygen atom can participate in resonance. This allows the positive charge to be delocalized onto the oxygen atom, creating a resonance structure with an octet on every atom (except hydrogen), which is a major stabilizing feature.\nThe key resonance structure is one where a double bond forms between the ring and the benzylic carbon, and another double bond forms between the ring carbon and the hydroxyl oxygen, placing the positive charge on the oxygen. This p-quinonoid type structure contributes significantly to the overall stability of the p-hydroxybenzyl cation, making it exceptionally stable. Due to this enhanced stability, the fragment at m/z 107 is the most abundant fragment in the mass spectrum of p-ethylphenol, making it the base peak.\n\nStep 3: Compare the results and select the correct option.\nFor ethylbenzene, the base peak is at m/z 91, resulting from the formation of the stable tropylium ion.\nFor p-ethylphenol, the base peak is at m/z 107, resulting from the formation of the highly resonance-stabilized p-hydroxybenzyl cation.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. Incorrect. The base peaks are at different m/z values.\nB. Incorrect. The base peak for ethylbenzene is the fragment at m/z 91, not the molecular ion.\nC. Incorrect. The base peak for p-ethylphenol is the fragment at m/z 107, not the molecular ion.\nD. Correct. This option accurately states that the base peak for ethylbenzene is at m/z 91 and the base peak for p-ethylphenol is at m/z 107.\nE. Incorrect. This describes alpha-cleavage (loss of the whole ethyl group), which produces a less stable phenyl cation (m/z 77) or p-hydroxyphenyl cation (m/z 93). Benzylic cleavage (beta-cleavage) leads to a much more stable benzylic cation and is the dominant pathway.\n\nTherefore, the correct prediction is that the base peak for ethylbenzene will be at m/z 91, and the base peak for p-ethylphenol will be at m/z 107.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2180801"}]}
