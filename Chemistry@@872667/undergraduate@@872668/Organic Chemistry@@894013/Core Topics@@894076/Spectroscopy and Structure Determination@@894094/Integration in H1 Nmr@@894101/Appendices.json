The resulting spectrum shows three distinct, non-overlapping signals. The instrument's integrator provides the relative areas under these three signals as 17.5, 26.25, and 52.5 arbitrary units. Further structural analysis reveals that the molecule contains exactly one tert-butyl group, which accounts for one of the observed signals. What is the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of this compound?", "solution": "In ¹H NMR, the integrated area under each signal is proportional to the number of equivalent hydrogen atoms contributing to that signal. Let the three measured areas be $A_{1}=17.5$, $A_{2}=26.25$, and $A_{3}=52.5$ (arbitrary units). Their ratio is obtained by dividing by a common factor that yields integers.\n\nObserve that $8.75$ divides each:\n$$\n\\frac{A_{1}}{8.75}=\\frac{17.5}{8.75}=2,\\quad \\frac{A_{2}}{8.75}=\\frac{26.25}{8.75}=3,\\quad \\frac{A_{3}}{8.75}=\\frac{52.5}{8.75}=6.\n$$\nTherefore, the hydrogen counts for the three signals are in the ratio $2:3:6$. Let the absolute numbers of hydrogens be $2k$, $3k$, and $6k$ for some positive integer $k$.\n\nA tert-butyl group contributes $9$ equivalent hydrogens to one signal. This must match one member of $\\{2k,3k,6k\\}$. The only possibility giving an integer $k$ is\n$$\n3k=9 \\implies k=3.\n$$\nHence the three signals correspond to $2k=6$, $3k=9$, and $6k=18$ hydrogens.
