This problem delves into a common practical issue: the effect of byproducts on reaction efficiency.

The student does not add a tertiary amine base, such as pyridine or triethylamine, to the reaction mixture. After a sufficient reaction time, the student observes a very poor yield of the desired product, ethyl benzoate.

Protonation converts ethanol into a positively charged oxonium species whose highest occupied orbital is strongly stabilized and whose oxygen bears a positive charge, drastically reducing its nucleophilicity toward the electrophilic acyl chloride. Thus, with only one equivalent of ethanol present, a significant portion of the remaining ethanol is rapidly sequestered as the ethyloxonium ion by the stoichiometric $\\text{HCl}$ produced, leading to a poor yield of ester.\n\nRuling out the alternatives:\n- Benzoic acid arises from hydrolysis of the acyl chloride by water, not from ethanol being converted by $\\text{HCl}$, and it is not the ethanol-derived species in question.\n- Diethyl ether would require acid-catalyzed dehydration of ethanol under strongly acidic, heated conditions and is not the immediate product of ethanol plus $\\text{HCl}$ in ether solvent.\n- Ethyl chloride formation from ethanol and $\\text{HCl}$ is not rapid under these conditions and typically requires activation (for example, $\\text{ZnCl}_{2}$) for primary alcohols; moreover, the immediate consequence of $\\text{HCl}$ is protonation to the oxonium ion.\n- Benzoyl anhydride would be formed from benzoyl chloride and benzoate, not from ethanol, and does not address the conversion of ethanol into a non-nucleophilic species.\n\nTherefore, the non-nucleophilic species formed from ethanol by the stoichiometric byproduct $\\text{HCl}$ is the ethyloxonium ion, $\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{OH}_{2}^{+}$.\n\nThe correct option is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2194344"}, {"introduction": "In a complex reaction mixture, multiple pathways can compete with one another. This practice problem presents a classic scenario where the inherent properties of a starting material interfere with the intended reaction catalyzed by a Lewis acid. By examining the attempted Friedel-Crafts acylation of aniline, you will learn to anticipate how a substrate's functional groups can interact with catalysts, leading to unexpected but predictable outcomes and demonstrating the need to protect certain groups during synthesis [@problem_id:2194325].", "problem": "An undergraduate chemist attempts to synthesize *p*-aminoacetophenone via a Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction.

The student expects the amino group of aniline, being a strong activating ortho, para-director, to facilitate acylation at the para position of the aromatic ring. However, upon completion of the reaction and subsequent aqueous workup, analysis of the reaction mixture shows that the desired *p*-aminoacetophenone is not the major product. Instead, a different organic compound is isolated in high yield.\n\nWhich of the following compounds represents the major organic product of this attempted reaction?\n\nA. *p*-aminoacetophenone\n\nB. *m*-aminoacetophenone\n\nC.

Therefore, electrophilic aromatic substitution (Friedel-Crafts acylation on the ring) is strongly suppressed.\n\nConcurrently, acetyl chloride is activated by $\\text{AlCl}_3$ to generate a potent acylating species:\n$$ \\text{CH}_3\\text{COCl} + \\text{AlCl}_3 \\to \\text{CH}_3\\text{CO}^+ + \\text{AlCl}_4^-. $$\nIn this mixture, the most nucleophilic site available is the aniline nitrogen, not the deactivated aromatic ring.

This is why, in practice, to perform Friedel-Crafts acylation on an aniline derivative, the amino group is first protected as an amide (e.g., acetanilide), which is less basic yet still ortho/para-directing, and only then is the aromatic acylation carried out, followed by deprotection to regenerate the amine.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2194325"}]}
