The reagent is methylmagnesium bromide, a Grignard reagent, used in excess, in an ether solvent, followed by an aqueous acid workup with dilute HCl.\n\nKey reactivity principles:\n1) Grignard reagents act as carbon nucleophiles that add to carbonyl groups. For esters, the first addition gives a tetrahedral intermediate that collapses with loss of alkoxide to form a ketone. Because ketones are more electrophilic than esters, a second equivalent of the Grignard reagent adds to the ketone, yielding a tertiary alkoxide. Aqueous acid workup then protonates the alkoxide to give a tertiary alcohol.\n2) Overall, an ester $R^{1}COOR^{2}$ treated with $2$ equivalents of $RMgX$, then $H_{3}O^{+}$, furnishes $R^{1}C(OH)(R)_{2}$, a tertiary alcohol bearing two $R$ groups from the Grignard reagent and the $R^{1}$ group from the acyl portion of the ester.\n\nApplying this to the present case:\n- The ester is $ArCOOMe$ with $Ar$ being the $4$-methoxyphenyl group.\n- The Grignard reagent is $MeMgBr$.\n- First addition and collapse yield the aryl methyl ketone (4-methoxyacetophenone) as an intermediate.\n- Because the reagent is in excess, a second $Me$ adds to the ketone to form the tertiary alkoxide $ArC(OMgBr)(Me)_{2}$.\n- Acid workup ($H_{3}O^{+}$) converts the alkoxide to the tertiary alcohol $ArC(OH)(Me)_{2}$.\n\nIn compact form:\n$$ArCOOMe + 2\\,MeMgBr \\xrightarrow{\\text{ether}} ArC(OMgBr)(Me)_{2} \\xrightarrow{H_{3}O^{+}} ArC(OH)(Me)_{2}$$\nwith $Ar=4$-methoxyphenyl. The product is therefore 2-(4-methoxyphenyl)propan-2-ol.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A (4-methoxyacetophenone) would be the intermediate from one equivalent, but with excess Grignard it is further converted to the tertiary alcohol.\n- B (1-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethanol) would arise from addition to an aldehyde, not an ester.\n- C (2-(4-methoxyphenyl)propan-2-ol) matches the expected tertiary alcohol from two additions to the ester.\n- D (4-methoxybenzoic acid) would result from hydrolysis of the ester, which does not occur under Grignard reaction conditions; moreover, acid would quench the Grignard reagent.\n- E (2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propan-2-ol) would require demethylation of the anisole ether, which does not occur under these conditions.\n\nThus, the major product is 2-(4-methoxyphenyl)propan-2-ol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2194064"}, {"introduction": "A crucial skill for a synthetic chemist is the ability to work backward from a target molecule to simple starting materials, a process known as retrosynthesis.
