This first practice problem challenges you to do just that, requiring you to first deduce the structures of the carboxylic acid and alcohol from their respective preparations before applying the principles of Fischer esterification to name the final ester product [@problem_id:2170356]. This exercise connects esterification to broader synthetic pathways and solidifies crucial IUPAC nomenclature skills.", "problem": "An organic synthesis involves two initial steps. In the first step, Compound A, a carboxylic acid, is prepared by the vigorous oxidation of butan-1-al. In the second step, Compound B, a primary alcohol, is prepared from propene via a hydroboration-oxidation sequence. Compound A and Compound B are then refluxed in the presence of a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid to yield an ester, Compound C, and water. What is the correct name for Compound C according to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) nomenclature?\n\nA. Butyl propanoate\n\nB. Propyl butanoate\n\nC. sec-Butyl propanoate\n\nD. Isopropyl butanoate\n\nE. Propyl isobutanoate", "solution": "Interpret the starting materials and transformations step by step.\n\nFirst step: Compound A is obtained by vigorous oxidation of butan-1-al (butanal). An aldehyde under vigorous oxidation conditions is converted to the corresponding carboxylic acid by increasing the oxidation state of the carbonyl carbon and replacing the aldehydic hydrogen with a hydroxyl group to give the acid. Therefore, butan-1-al is oxidized to butanoic acid. Hence, Compound A is butanoic acid.\n\nSecond step: Compound B is prepared from propene via hydroboration-oxidation. Hydroboration-oxidation of an alkene proceeds with anti-Markovnikov regiochemistry and syn addition of hydrogen and hydroxyl across the double bond, followed by oxidation to the alcohol. Applied to propene, this yields the primary alcohol at the terminal carbon, namely propan-1-ol. Hence, Compound B is propan-1-ol.\n\nEster formation: Refluxing a carboxylic acid with an alcohol in the presence of a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid effects Fischer esterification, producing an ester and water. In the ester name, the alkyl group comes from the alcohol and the acyl portion (as the carboxylate) comes from the acid. Therefore, combining butanoic acid (butanoate) with propan-1-ol (propyl) gives the ester named propyl butanoate.\n\nMatch to options: Propyl butanoate corresponds to option B. The other options correspond to mismatched acid/alcohol combinations or incorrect regiochemical outcomes (e.g., isopropyl would arise from Markovnikov hydration, not hydroboration-oxidation; propanoate would require propanoic acid, not formed here).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2170356"}, {"introduction": "Beyond predicting a product's identity, a key skill in synthesis is predicting its quantity.

The planned reaction is a Fischer esterification of acetic acid with sec-butanol, using a catalytic amount of hot, concentrated sulfuric acid. While the primary goal is to produce sec-butyl acetate, the student anticipates that the harsh, acidic conditions at elevated temperature may also lead to the formation of unwanted alkene byproducts from the alcohol.\n\nFrom the list of compounds below, select all species that are expected to be formed as alkene byproducts in this reaction.\n\nA. Propene\n\nB. 2-Methylpropene\n\nC. But-1-ene\n\nD. But-2-ene\n\nE. Cyclobutane", "solution": "The alcohol used is sec-butanol (2-butanol), with the carbon skeleton $\\text{CH}_3\\text{–CH(OH)–CH}_2\\text{–CH}_3$. Under hot, concentrated sulfuric acid, secondary alcohols undergo acid-catalyzed dehydration by an E1 mechanism. The key principles are:\n1) Protonation of the hydroxyl group increases its leaving ability, generating water as the leaving group.\n2) Loss of water forms a carbocation at the carbon that bore the hydroxyl; here this is the 2-butyl carbocation, a secondary carbocation at C2.\n3) Deprotonation at a beta position yields an alkene; Zaitsev’s rule predicts the more substituted alkene is favored, but all alkenes accessible by beta-deprotonation can form.\n\nFrom the 2-butyl carbocation, there are beta hydrogens at C1 and C3. Deprotonation at C1 produces a double bond between C1 and C2, giving but-1-ene. Deprotonation at C3 produces a double bond between C2 and C3, giving but-2-ene (both E and Z stereoisomers are encompassed by the name but-2-ene).\n\nPossible rearrangements are evaluated next. The initially formed carbocation is secondary. A 1,2-hydride shift from C3 to C2 would generate another secondary carbocation at C3, offering no stability gain; a 1,2-methyl shift from any adjacent carbon would lead to a less stable primary carbocation. There is no pathway to a tertiary carbocation within this four-carbon framework without unfavorable skeletal rearrangements. Therefore, formation of 2-methylpropene (isobutene) via rearrangement is not expected.\n\nPropene would require carbon–carbon bond cleavage (fragmentation), which is not a typical outcome of simple E1 dehydration under these conditions. Cyclobutane would require ring formation, which is not produced by dehydration of a straight-chain four-carbon secondary alcohol.\n\nTherefore, the expected alkene byproducts are but-1-ene and but-2-ene, corresponding to options C and D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{CD}$$", "id": "2170349"}]}
