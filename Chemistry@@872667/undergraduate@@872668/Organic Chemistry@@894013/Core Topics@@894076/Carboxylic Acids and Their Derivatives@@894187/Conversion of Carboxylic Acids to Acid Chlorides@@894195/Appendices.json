This reaction is a key step in synthesizing various carboxylic acid derivatives such as esters and amides.\n\nSuppose an organic chemist aims to synthesize 4-nitrobenzoyl chloride. Which of the following compounds must be used as the starting carboxylic acid for this reaction?\n\nA. 4-nitrobenzoic acid\n\nB.

Evaluating the options:\n- 4-nitrobenzoic acid has the correct para nitro substituent and the carboxylic acid functional group, giving the desired acyl chloride under the reaction.\n- Benzoic acid lacks the nitro group, so it would yield benzoyl chloride, not 4-nitrobenzoyl chloride.\n- 4-nitrophenol is a phenol, not a carboxylic acid, and would not yield an acyl chloride of the carboxyl type under these conditions.\n- 2-nitrobenzoic acid would give 2-nitrobenzoyl chloride, placing the nitro substituent ortho rather than para.\n- 4-aminobenzoyl chloride is already an acyl chloride and is not a carboxylic acid; furthermore, it contains an amino group rather than a nitro group.\n\nTherefore, the correct starting carboxylic acid is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2163560"}, {"introduction": "Effective synthesis requires not only knowing the desired reaction but also anticipating potential side reactions. This practice presents a hypothetical scenario based on a common laboratory mistake to illustrate a crucial point: the high reactivity of acid chlorides demands careful control of reaction conditions.

The standard procedure involves reacting benzoic acid with thionyl chloride ($SOCl_2$). The reaction is typically performed in an inert solvent or with an excess of $SOCl_2$ acting as the solvent. However, the student makes a mistake and instead uses methanol ($CH_3OH$) as the solvent for the reaction. Upon workup, in addition to the byproducts sulfur dioxide ($SO_2$) and hydrogen chloride ($HCl$), a significant amount of an unintended ester is isolated.\n\nIdentify this major, unwanted ester side product from the options below.\n\nA. Ethyl benzoate\n\nB. Phenyl benzoate\n\nC. Methyl benzoate\n\nD. Benzyl acetate\n\nE. Methyl acetate", "solution": "The intended transformation is conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acyl chloride with thionyl chloride. The general reaction is a nucleophilic substitution at the acyl carbon where the hydroxyl of the acid is replaced by chloride, releasing gaseous byproducts. For benzoic acid, the stoichiometric equation is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{C_{6}H_{5}CO_{2}H + SOCl_{2} \\rightarrow C_{6}H_{5}COCl + SO_{2} + HCl}\n$$\nIn the mistaken setup, methanol is used as the solvent. Methanol is a nucleophile and will react rapidly with the formed acyl chloride via nucleophilic acyl substitution (alcoholysis). The mechanism proceeds by nucleophilic attack of $\\mathrm{CH_{3}OH}$ at the acyl carbon of $\\mathrm{C_{6}H_{5}COCl}$ to form a tetrahedral intermediate, followed by collapse with loss of $\\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$ and deprotonation to furnish the methyl ester.

This problem delves into the stereochemical course of acid chloride formation, revealing how reaction conditions can dictate the final stereochemistry of the product.

Experiment 1 yields a product with retention of configuration; Experiment 2 yields a racemic product.", "solution": "We identify the stereocenter and the step that could alter it. The substrate $(S)$-2-phenylpropanoic acid, written as $\\text{PhCH(CH}_3)\\text{COOH}$, has its stereocenter at the carbon alpha to the carboxyl group (the CH bearing H, CH_{3}, Ph, and COOH). Conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acid chloride does not directly involve substitution at this stereogenic center; thus, the only way to change configuration is via temporary loss of chirality through enolization (planar enol or enol-like intermediate) followed by reprotonation, which leads to racemization.\n\nKey principle: Acid-catalyzed enolization at the alpha position to a carbonyl proceeds by protonation of the carbonyl oxygen, formation of an enol (or its conjugate), and subsequent reprotonation at the alpha carbon from either face, erasing stereochemical information and yielding racemization. Removal or suppression of strong acid suppresses this pathway.\n\nExperiment 1 (SOCl_{2} in refluxing benzene, no base):\n- The reaction of a carboxylic acid with thionyl chloride generates HCl and SO_{2} as byproducts in situ.\n- In a non-nucleophilic solvent like benzene, the medium becomes strongly acidic due to dissolved HCl.\n- Under these acidic conditions, the alpha-stereocenter of the product acid chloride ($\\text{PhCH(CH}_3)\\text{COCl}$) undergoes acid-catalyzed enolization. The enolization step renders the alpha carbon planar, and reprotonation can occur from either face, leading predominantly to racemization of the stereocenter.\n- Therefore, the principal stereochemical outcome is a racemic 2-phenylpropanoyl chloride.\n\nExperiment 2 (SOCl_{2} with catalytic pyridine):\n- Pyridine acts as a nucleophilic base that traps the HCl formed, giving pyridinium chloride, thereby suppressing strong acid in solution.\n- The reaction proceeds through an acyl pyridinium intermediate, accelerating formation of the acid chloride while minimizing acid-catalyzed enolization at the alpha carbon.\n- Since the stereocenter is not directly involved in bond-making/breaking during the acyl chloride formation and enolization is suppressed, the original configuration is retained to a high extent.\n- Therefore, the principal stereochemical outcome is retention of configuration, giving predominantly the $(S)$-2-phenylpropanoyl chloride.\n\nConclusion:\n- Experiment 1: racemization due to acid-catalyzed enolization in the presence of HCl.\n- Experiment 2: retention due to HCl scavenging by pyridine and avoidance of enolization.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2163575"}]}
