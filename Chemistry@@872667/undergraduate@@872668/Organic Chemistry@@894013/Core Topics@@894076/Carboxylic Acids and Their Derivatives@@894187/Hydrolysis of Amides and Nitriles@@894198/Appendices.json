Butanamide", "solution": "We are told the unknown is a primary amide and that hot aqueous sodium hydroxide converts it completely into two principal products: sodium pentanoate (organic) and ammonia (inorganic). The key chemical principle is base-promoted hydrolysis of amides.

This implies the carbon skeleton of the original amide corresponds to pentanamide, since base hydrolysis preserves the carbon framework at the carbonyl carbon and produces the carboxylate of the same acid (aside from deprotonation).

Throughout these steps, the carbon skeleton remains intact and there is no formation or breaking of the $\\mathrm{C{-}C}$ bond at the stereogenic center.\n\nThe stereochemical outcome is dictated by whether the chiral center is involved in any step that could lead to racemization (such as formation of a planar carbocation at that center or enolization at that center). In this case, the stereocenter is at $\\mathrm{C3}$, while the functional group being transformed is at $\\mathrm{C1}$ (the nitrile carbon becoming the carboxyl carbon).
