The reaction medium is dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a polar aprotic solvent, and the nucleophile is the cyanide ion ($CN^−$) provided by sodium cyanide.\n\nRelevant principles:\n- In a polar aprotic solvent such as DMSO, anionic nucleophiles are poorly solvated and thus exhibit enhanced nucleophilicity. This environment strongly favors the bimolecular nucleophilic substitution ($S_N2$) mechanism over the unimolecular ($S_N1$) mechanism.\n- The cyanide ion is an ambident nucleophile, but for alkyl halides under $S_N2$ conditions, attack occurs predominantly through the carbon atom to form a nitrile ($R-CN$), rather than through nitrogen to form an isocyanide ($R-NC$).\n- An $S_N2$ reaction proceeds in a single concerted step with backside attack at the stereogenic center bearing the leaving group. This causes a complete inversion of configuration (a Walden inversion).\n\nApplication to this case:\n- The reaction is a classic $S_N2$ displacement. The cyanide nucleophile attacks the stereogenic C2 carbon from the side opposite the bromide leaving group.\n- This backside attack results in an inversion of configuration, so the (R) reactant yields an (S) product. The Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities of the substituents ($Br$ and $CN$ are both priority #1) are maintained, so the label inverts directly.\n- The bromo group at position 2 of the pentane chain is replaced by a cyano group.

In a large excess of ethanol under gentle heating, a polar protic solvent and weak nucleophile/base are present, so solvolysis proceeds predominantly by an $S_N1/E1$ pathway.\n\nStep 1: Formation of the carbocation. Ionization of the C–Br bond occurs to give a secondary carbocation at C2:\n$CH_3-CH^{+}-CH(CH_3)_2 + Br^{-}$.\nThis follows the $S_N1$ principle that the rate-determining step is ionization to form a carbocation intermediate.\n\nStep 2: Carbocation rearrangement. Carbocation stability follows the order tertiary  secondary  primary. The secondary carbocation at C2 is adjacent to a tertiary carbon (C3). A 1,2-hydride shift from C3 to C2 generates a more stable tertiary carbocation at the original C3 position:\n$CH_3-CH_2-C^{+}(CH_3)_2$.\nThis rearrangement is favored because it leads to a more stable carbocation.\n\nStep 3: Nucleophilic capture by ethanol. The solvent ethanol, acting as a nucleophile, attacks the tertiary carbocation to form an oxonium intermediate:\n$CH_3-CH_2-C(OEtH)^{+}(CH_3)_2$.\n\nStep 4: Deprotonation. A base (another molecule of ethanol or bromide) removes the proton from the oxygen to give the neutral ether product:\n$CH_3-CH_2-C(OEt)(CH_3)_2$.\n\nStep 5: Identify the major substitution product. Naming the product using the lowest locants for substituents on the longest chain gives 2-ethoxy-2-methylbutane. This corresponds to option C. The unrearranged substitution product (option A, 2-ethoxy-3-methylbutane) would arise from direct capture of the initial secondary carbocation and is a minor product relative to the rearranged one. Option E is an elimination product, and option D would form if water were the solvent, not ethanol.\n\nTherefore, the major substitution product is 2-ethoxy-2-methylbutane.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2178723"}]}
