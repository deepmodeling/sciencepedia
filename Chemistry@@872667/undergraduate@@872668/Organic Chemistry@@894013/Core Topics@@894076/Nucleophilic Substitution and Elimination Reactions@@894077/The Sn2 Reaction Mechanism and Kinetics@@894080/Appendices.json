Within the same period, lower electronegativity corresponds to higher nucleophilicity; nitrogen is less electronegative than oxygen, so a nitrogen-centered nucleophile is typically more nucleophilic than an oxygen-centered one. Moreover, resonance delocalization diminishes nucleophilicity by lowering the HOMO energy. The acetate ion $\\mathrm{CH_{3}CO_{2}^{-}}$ has its negative charge delocalized over two oxygens, which reduces its nucleophilicity. The azide ion $\\mathrm{N_{3}^{-}}$ is well known as a highly effective $S_{N}2$ nucleophile at a terminal nitrogen, and in acetone it is less strongly solvated than in protic media, enhancing its nucleophilicity relative to acetate.\n\nAlthough basicity and nucleophilicity can correlate in polar aprotic solvents, the provided $pK_{a}$ values $pK_{a}(\\mathrm{HN_{3}})=4.6$ and $pK_{a}(\\mathrm{CH_{3}COOH})=4.76$ indicate only a small difference in basicity; hence acetate is not a significantly stronger base than azide, and near-equality of $pK_{a}$ does not imply equal nucleophilicity because nucleophilicity is a kinetic property influenced by electronegativity, polarizability, and resonance.
