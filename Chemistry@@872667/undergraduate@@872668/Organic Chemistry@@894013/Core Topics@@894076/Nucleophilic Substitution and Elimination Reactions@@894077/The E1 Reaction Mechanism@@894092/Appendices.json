Protons that are chemically indistinguishable due to molecular symmetry or rapid conformational changes are considered to belong to the same 'set'.\n\nDetermine the total number of distinct sets of $\\beta$-hydrogens that are available for abstraction from the carbocation intermediate formed from 3-bromo-3-ethylpentane. Your answer should be a single integer.", "solution": "The substrate 3-bromo-3-ethylpentane has a central carbon at C3 bearing four substituents: Br, the C2 side of the pentane chain, the C4 side of the pentane chain, and an ethyl group. After the E1 ionization step, Br leaves to give a carbocation centered at C3. This carbocation is tertiary and is bonded to three ethyl groups: via C2 (leading to C1), via C4 (leading to C5), and via the explicit ethyl substituent at C3. Thus, the carbocation is a triethylcarbenium ion.\n\nIn E1, the base abstracts a proton from a beta carbon, i.e., a carbon adjacent to the carbocation center. The beta carbons here are the three methylene carbons directly attached to C3 in each ethyl branch. Each such beta carbon is a methylene bearing two hydrogens, so there are a total of $3 \\times 2 = 6$ beta hydrogens.\n\nWe must count distinct sets of beta hydrogens up to chemical equivalence arising from symmetry and rapid conformational averaging. Because the carbocation at C3 is bonded to three identical ethyl groups, the molecule possesses a threefold permutation symmetry among the branches, making the three beta methylene carbons equivalent. Within any one methylene, the two hydrogens are enantiotopic in an achiral, rapidly equilibrating environment and are chemically indistinguishable under the stated conditions. Therefore, all six beta hydrogens belong to a single equivalence set.\n\nOnly beta hydrogens are considered; hydrogens on the terminal methyls are gamma and are not abstracted in the E1 step that forms a double bond to C3.\n\nHence, the total number of distinct sets of beta hydrogens available for abstraction is $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2210157"}, {"introduction": "Understanding a reaction mechanism in isolation is only half the battle; a chemist must also know when that mechanism is likely to occur. This problem explores the crucial competition between unimolecular (E1/$S_N1$) and bimolecular (E2) pathways. By analyzing how reaction conditions, specifically the strength of the base, dictate the outcome for a tertiary alkyl halide, you will develop the critical ability to predict the dominant mechanism and major products [@problem_id:2210120].", "problem": "An undergraduate student is investigating elimination reactions using 2-chloro-2-methylpropane as the starting material. Two separate experiments are conducted.\n\nIn **Experiment A**, the student dissolves 2-chloro-2-methylpropane in pure, anhydrous ethanol and heats the solution. The reaction proceeds slowly, and analysis of the product mixture reveals the formation of 2-methylpropene as the major elimination product, but also a substantial amount of 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane.\n\nIn **Experiment B**, the student dissolves 2-chloro-2-methylpropane in anhydrous ethanol and then adds a stoichiometric equivalent of sodium ethoxide ($CH_3CH_2ONa$). This reaction proceeds much more rapidly than Experiment A, yielding 2-methylpropene as the overwhelming major product, with only trace amounts of 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane observed.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate mechanistic explanation for the difference in reaction rates and product distributions observed between Experiment A and Experiment B?\n\nA. The reaction in Experiment A proceeds via an $S_N2$ mechanism, while the reaction in Experiment B proceeds via an E2 mechanism. The steric bulk of the ethoxide ion in Experiment B prevents it from acting as a nucleophile.\n\nB. In Experiment A, ethanol acts as a strong base, promoting a rapid E1 reaction. In Experiment B, the ethoxide ion is a weaker base than ethanol, which slows down the reaction but favors elimination.\n\nC. Both experiments proceed through a stable tertiary carbocation intermediate. The reaction is faster in Experiment B because the higher concentration of negative charge from the ethoxide ion better stabilizes this carbocation.\n\nD. In Experiment A, the reaction proceeds slowly via competing E1 and $S_N1$ pathways that share a common carbocation intermediate, as ethanol is a weak base and nucleophile. In Experiment B, the strong ethoxide base promotes a rapid, concerted E2 reaction that outpaces the other pathways.\n\nE. The primary difference is the solvent polarity. The addition of ionic sodium ethoxide in Experiment B drastically increases the solvent's polarity, which selectively accelerates the E2 transition state compared to the E1 transition state.", "solution": "The goal is to determine the correct mechanistic explanation for the different outcomes of the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane under two different conditions: (A) with ethanol alone, and (B) with sodium ethoxide in ethanol.\n\n**Analysis of the Substrate and Reagents**\n\nFirst, let's analyze the starting material. 2-chloro-2-methylpropane is a tertiary alkyl halide. Due to significant steric hindrance around the alpha-carbon, it cannot undergo an $S_N2$ reaction. It is, however, an excellent substrate for reactions that involve a carbocation intermediate ($S_N1$, E1) because it can form a stable tertiary carbocation. It can also undergo an E2 reaction if a sufficiently strong base is present.\n\n**Analysis of Experiment A**\n\n*   **Reagent/Solvent:** Pure ethanol ($CH_3CH_2OH$).\n*   **Properties:** Ethanol is a polar protic solvent. It is a weak nucleophile and a very weak base.\n*   **Mechanism:** When a tertiary alkyl halide is placed in a solution with only a weak nucleophile/weak base, the reaction must proceed through a unimolecular pathway. The rate-determining step is the spontaneous dissociation of the leaving group (chloride ion) to form a stable tertiary carbocation, $(CH_3)_3C^+$.\n    $$(CH_3)_3C-Cl \\xrightarrow{\\text{slow}} (CH_3)_3C^+ + Cl^-$$\n*   **Product Formation:** This carbocation intermediate is planar and highly reactive. It can be attacked by the solvent in two ways:\n    1.  **$S_N1$ Pathway:** The ethanol molecule acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbocation. A subsequent deprotonation step yields the substitution product, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane.\n        $$(CH_3)_3C^+ + CH_3CH_2OH \\rightarrow (CH_3)_3C-O^+(H)CH_2CH_3 \\xrightarrow{-H^+} (CH_3)_3C-OCH_2CH_3$$\n    2.  **E1 Pathway:** The ethanol molecule acts as a base, removing a proton from a carbon adjacent to the carbocation (a beta-carbon). This forms the elimination product, 2-methylpropene.\n        $$CH_3-C^+(CH_3)_2 + CH_3CH_2OH \\rightarrow CH_2=C(CH_3)_2 + CH_3CH_2OH_2^+$$\n*   **Conclusion for Experiment A:** The reaction is slow because the rate-determining step (carbocation formation) has a high activation energy. The formation of both substitution (2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane) and elimination (2-methylpropene) products is consistent with competing $S_N1$ and E1 pathways proceeding through a common carbocation intermediate.\n\n**Analysis of Experiment B**\n\n*   **Reagent/Solvent:** Sodium ethoxide ($CH_3CH_2ONa$) in ethanol. This salt dissociates to provide sodium ions ($Na^+$) and a high concentration of ethoxide ions ($CH_3CH_2O^-$).\n*   **Properties:** The ethoxide ion is a strong base and a strong nucleophile.\n*   **Mechanism:** In the presence of a strong base, a bimolecular elimination (E2) pathway becomes available and is highly favored for tertiary substrates. In the E2 mechanism, the base removes a beta-proton in a single, concerted step while the leaving group departs. There is no carbocation intermediate. The rate of an E2 reaction is dependent on the concentration of both the substrate and the base:\n    $$\\text{Rate} = k[\\text{Substrate}][\\text{Base}]$$\n    $$CH_3CH_2O^- + H-CH_2-C(Cl)(CH_3)_2 \\xrightarrow{\\text{fast, concerted}} CH_3CH_2OH + CH_2=C(CH_3)_2 + Cl^-$$\n*   **Conclusion for Experiment B:** The E2 pathway has a lower activation energy than the E1 pathway (it doesn't require forming a high-energy carbocation) and is therefore much faster, especially with a high concentration of strong base. This rapid E2 reaction dominates, leading to a high yield of the elimination product, 2-methylpropene. Since the strong base preferentially attacks the more accessible beta-proton rather than the sterically hindered alpha-carbon, elimination is heavily favored over substitution.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options**\n\n*   **A:** Incorrect. $S_N2$ does not occur on a tertiary substrate. While ethoxide's bulk can disfavor substitution in some cases, its primary role here is as a strong base, and it is not considered particularly bulky compared to bases like tert-butoxide.\n*   **B:** Incorrect. Ethanol is a very weak base, not a strong one. Ethoxide is a much stronger base than ethanol. The premise is flawed.\n*   **C:** Incorrect. The E2 reaction in Experiment B is concerted and does not proceed through a carbocation intermediate. This is a fundamental difference between the E1 and E2 mechanisms.\n*   **D:** Correct. This statement accurately describes the situation. Experiment A involves slow, competing unimolecular (E1/$S_N1$) reactions with a weak base/nucleophile. Experiment B involves a fast, bimolecular (E2) reaction promoted by the strong ethoxide base, which outcompetes the slower unimolecular pathways.\n*   **E:** Incorrect. While adding an ionic salt can affect solvent polarity, this is a secondary effect. The primary reason for the dramatic change in rate and product distribution is the introduction of a strong base, which fundamentally changes the dominant reaction mechanism from unimolecular (E1/$S_N1$) to bimolecular (E2).\n\nTherefore, option D provides the most accurate and complete mechanistic explanation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2210120"}, {"introduction": "The E1 reaction is famous for a feature that can make it both complex and synthetically powerful: the rearrangement of its carbocation intermediate. This practice challenges you to trace the entire E1 pathway for a substrate that undergoes a 1,2-methyl shift to form a more stable carbocation before elimination. By using isotopic labeling to follow the atoms, this problem provides a clear confirmation of the mechanistic steps, including rearrangement and Zaitsev's rule for regioselectivity [@problem_id:2210187].", "problem": "A sample of an isotopically labeled alkyl halide, 2-bromo-3,3-dimethyl-1,1,1-trideuteriobutane, which has the chemical structure $\\text{CD}_3\\text{-CH(Br)-C(CH}_3)_2\\text{-CH}_3$, is heated in ethanol. These conditions are known to favor an E1 elimination pathway. Your task is to determine the chemical identity of the major alkene product that results from this reaction.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the major organic product?\n\nA. The product is 2,3-dimethylbut-2-ene, and the $\\text{CD}_3$ group is attached to one of the sp²-hybridized carbons of the double bond.\n\nB. The product is 2,3-dimethylbut-1-ene, and the $\\text{CD}_3$ group is attached to a carbon that is not part of the C=C double bond.\n\nC.

The product is 3,3-dimethylbut-1-ene, in which the deuterium label appears as a $=\\text{CD}_2$ group.\n\nE. The product is 2,3-dimethylbut-2-ene, but the deuterium label has been completely removed from the molecule during the reaction.", "solution": "Identify the carbon skeleton and labels. The substrate is 2-bromo-3,3-dimethyl-1,1,1-trideuteriobutane with the connectivity $\\text{CD}_3$ (C1)–CH(Br) (C2)–C($\\text{CH}_3$)2 (C3)–$\\text{CH}_3$ (C4). Carbon C3 is quaternary (bonded to C2, C4, and two methyl groups) and bears no hydrogens; C2 is secondary and bears one hydrogen; C1 is a $\\text{CD}_3$ group.\n\nApply the E1 mechanism. In ethanol under E1-favoring conditions, the first, rate-determining step is unimolecular ionization: loss of bromide from C2 to give a secondary carbocation at C2. This obeys the principle that E1 proceeds via carbocation formation.\n\nAssess immediate elimination without rearrangement. From the C2 carbocation, elimination requires removal of a beta-hydrogen from an adjacent carbon. The beta carbons are C1 and C3. Since C3 has no hydrogens, only C1 can supply a beta hydrogen, but C1 bears deuteriums ($\\text{CD}_3$). Direct E1 elimination from the unrearranged carbocation thus would remove D from C1, forming a double bond between C1 and C2 to give a terminal alkene with a terminal $=\\text{CD}_2$ unit. This corresponds to 3,3-dimethylbut-1-ene with deuterium at the terminal vinylic carbon. However, such a product is less substituted (less stable) and involves cleavage of a C–D bond, which is less favorable than C–H cleavage. Therefore, this path is disfavored relative to rearrangement and Zaitsev elimination.\n\nConsider carbocation rearrangement. From the secondary carbocation at C2, a 1,2-methyl shift from the adjacent quaternary carbon C3 to C2 is favorable because it produces a more stable tertiary carbocation at C3. A 1,2-hydride shift is impossible since C3 has no hydrogens. The 1,2-methyl shift moves one methyl group from C3 to C2, neutralizing C2 and placing the positive charge on C3. This follows the general principle that carbocations rearrange to achieve greater stability.\n\nEliminate from the tertiary carbocation. From the tertiary carbocation at C3, ethanol (or its conjugate base) can remove a beta hydrogen from adjacent carbons:\n- From C2 (which still bears one hydrogen): deprotonation at C2 forms a double bond between C2 and C3. The resulting alkene is tetrasubstituted because the C2 $sp^{2}$ carbon is substituted by a $\\text{CD}_3$ group and a $\\text{CH}_3$ group, and the C3 $sp^{2}$ carbon is substituted by two methyl groups. This alkene is a derivative of 2,3-dimethylbut-2-ene.\n- From C4 (a methyl group) or from the remaining methyl substituent on C3: deprotonation at either gives a double bond to C3 that is only tri-substituted, less stable than the tetrasubstituted alternative.\n\nZaitsev’s rule and alkene stability considerations (greater substitution stabilizes the double bond through hyperconjugation and inductive effects) predict that the tetrasubstituted alkene formed by deprotonation at C2 (giving C2=C3) is the major product.\n\nTrack the isotopic label. After initial ionization and the 1,2-methyl shift, the rearranged carbocation is $\\text{CH}_3\\text{-C}^+\\text{(CH}_3\\text{)-CH(CH}_3\\text{)-CD}_3$. In the major elimination step to form the C2=C3 double bond, the hydrogen atom is lost from C2. The $\\text{CD}_3$ group remains intact and is attached to the C2 carbon, which becomes one of the $sp^2$ carbons of the double bond.\n\nConclude the identity of the major product. The major alkene has the skeleton of 2,3-dimethylbut-2-ene, with a $\\text{CD}_3$ group attached to an $sp^2$ carbon of the double bond. This corresponds to statement A.
