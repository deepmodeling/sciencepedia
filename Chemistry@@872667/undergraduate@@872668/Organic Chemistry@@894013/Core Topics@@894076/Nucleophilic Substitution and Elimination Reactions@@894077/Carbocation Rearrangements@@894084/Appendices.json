This first practice problem explores a classic scenario where the initially formed carbocation undergoes a structural change to achieve greater stability before the final product is formed. By working through this example, you will practice identifying the potential for a 1,2-methyl shift and predicting the major product in a reaction governed by carbocation rearrangement.

The student treats a sample of 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene with an excess of hydrogen chloride (HCl) in a suitable inert solvent. Assuming the reaction goes to completion via the most stable pathway, predict the major organic product that is formed.\n\nChoose from the following options:\n\nA. 2-chloro-3,3-dimethylbutane\n\nB. 1-chloro-3,3-dimethylbutane\n\nC. 2-chloro-2,3-dimethylbutane\n\nD. 1-chloro-2,3-dimethylbutane", "solution": "Label the alkene carbons in 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene as $\\text{C}_1=\\text{C}_2-\\text{C}_3-\\text{C}_4$, with $C_3$ bearing two additional methyl groups (so $C_3$ is attached to $C_2$, $C_4$, and two methyls, i.e., a quaternary carbon). Treatment with HCl proceeds by electrophilic addition via the more stable carbocation.\n\nProtonation can occur at either $C_1$ or $C_2$:\n- If $H^+$ adds to $C_1$, the carbocation forms at $C_2$. This $C_2^+$ is secondary (attached to $C_1$ and $C_3$ as carbon substituents).\n- If $H^+$ adds to $C_2$, the carbocation forms at $C_1$, which would be primary and much less stable.\n\nThus initial protonation favors addition to $C_1$ to give the secondary carbocation at $C_2$. From this $C_2^+$, a $1,2$-methyl shift from the adjacent quaternary $C_3$ to $C_2$ is possible. $C_3$ bears no hydrogens, so hydride shift cannot occur; the methyl shift generates a more stable tertiary carbocation at $C_3$. Chloride then captures this tertiary carbocation, placing Cl at the original $C_3$.\n\nThe resulting structure, when named along the butane parent chain to give the lowest set of locants, is 2-chloro-2,3-dimethylbutane. This corresponds to option C. A direct Markovnikov capture without rearrangement would give 2-chloro-3,3-dimethylbutane (option A), but the rearranged product derived from the tertiary carbocation is the major product under the stated “most stable pathway” condition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2157926"}, {"introduction": "Having seen that carbocation rearrangements can occur, a crucial next step is to understand the driving force behind them. This comparative exercise challenges you to explain why a rearrangement is a key pathway in one reaction but is completely absent in another. The central principle to grasp is that rearrangements are not random; they are thermodynamically driven processes that occur only if they lead to a more stable carbocation intermediate.

The mechanism proceeds through the formation of a carbocation intermediate. Consider two such reactions:\n\nReaction 1: The acid-catalyzed hydration of propene yields 2-propanol as the exclusive product. No 1-propanol is formed.\nReaction 2: The acid-catalyzed hydration of 3-methyl-1-butene yields a mixture of products, with 2-methyl-2-butanol being the major product and 3-methyl-2-butanol as a minor product.\n\nA key mechanistic step that can occur with carbocation intermediates is a rearrangement, typically a 1,2-hydride or 1,2-alkyl shift, to form a more stable carbocation. Based on the product distributions of the two reactions, which of the following statements provides the correct reasoning for why a carbocation rearrangement is a major pathway in the hydration of 3-methyl-1-butene but is not observed in the hydration of propene?\n\nA. The smaller size of the propene molecule results in significant steric hindrance that prevents the migration of a hydrogen atom necessary for rearrangement.\n\nB. Carbocation rearrangements are generally only favorable when the initially formed carbocation is primary; since propene forms a secondary carbocation, no rearrangement is expected.\n\nC. The acid catalyst is consumed in the rearrangement step, and the reaction with propene does not use a high enough concentration of acid to make this pathway viable.\n\nD. The secondary carbocation formed from propene cannot rearrange to a more stable carbocation, whereas the secondary carbocation from 3-methyl-1-butene can rearrange to a more stable tertiary carbocation.\n\nE. Propene is a symmetrical alkene, and carbocation rearrangements only occur in reactions involving asymmetrical alkenes.", "solution": "Principle: In acid-catalyzed hydration, an alkene is protonated to give the more stable carbocation (Markovnikov step), followed by nucleophilic attack by water and deprotonation. Carbocation rearrangements (1,2-hydride or 1,2-alkyl shifts) occur if they convert the initially formed carbocation into a more stable one; the driving force is the stability order $\\text{tertiary}>\\text{secondary}>\\text{primary}$.\n\nReaction 1 (propene): Protonation of $\\text{CH}_3-\\text{CH}=\\text{CH}_2$ at the terminal carbon forms the secondary carbocation $\\text{CH}_3-\\overset{+}{\\text{C}}\\text{H}-\\text{CH}_3$. Any 1,2-hydride or 1,2-alkyl shift from this carbocation would relocate the positive charge to a primary carbon, which is less stable. Therefore, no rearrangement is favored, water attacks this secondary carbocation, and the product is 2-propanol exclusively; no 1-propanol forms.\n\nReaction 2 (3-methyl-1-butene): For $\\text{CH}_2=\\text{CH}-\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_3)-\\text{CH}_3$, Markovnikov protonation at the terminal carbon gives a secondary carbocation at the adjacent internal carbon. This secondary carbocation is adjacent to a more substituted center, allowing a 1,2-hydride shift to generate a tertiary carbocation. The rearranged tertiary carbocation is more stable, so water capture after rearrangement gives 2-methyl-2-butanol as the major product. Direct capture without rearrangement gives 3-methyl-2-butanol as the minor product.\n\nThus, rearrangement is not observed for propene because its secondary carbocation cannot rearrange to a more stable carbocation, whereas in 3-methyl-1-butene the initially formed secondary carbocation can rearrange to a more stable tertiary carbocation.

This final practice problem presents an $S_N1$ reaction where the initially formed carbocation is already highly stable.

A key feature of $S_N1$ reactions is the potential for the intermediate carbocation to rearrange to form a more stable carbocation, which would then lead to a mixture of constitutional isomers as products. However, in the case of 1-bromo-1-methylcyclohexane, it is observed that no products resulting from rearrangement are formed.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the best chemical explanation for this observation?\n\nA. The initial carbocation formed is tertiary, and any potential 1,2-hydride or 1,2-alkyl shift would lead to a less stable secondary carbocation.\n\nB. The cyclohexane ring exists in a rigid chair conformation that sterically hinders the migration of a hydrogen or alkyl group.\n\nC. A 1,2-hydride shift would generate a positive charge on a bridgehead carbon, which is a violation of Bredt's rule.\n\nD. The significant steric bulk of the methyl group and the cyclohexane ring prevents the bromide leaving group from departing, thus inhibiting the $S_N1$ reaction pathway altogether.\n\nE. The C-Br bond is exceptionally strong due to hyperconjugation with the adjacent methyl group, which raises the activation energy for carbocation formation above the energy required for a competing $S_N2$ reaction.", "solution": "In solvolysis of 1-bromo-1-methylcyclohexane in a protic solvent, the rate-determining step of an $S_N1$ pathway is ionization to form the carbocation at $C_1$. The carbon bearing the leaving group ($C_1$) is bonded to three carbons (the methyl group, $C_2$, and $C_6$), so the initially formed carbocation is tertiary, which is the most stable class of simple alkyl carbocations due to greater hyperconjugation and inductive stabilization.\n\nA 1,2-rearrangement (hydride or alkyl shift) is thermodynamically favorable only if it generates a carbocation that is at least as stable as, and typically more stable than, the starting carbocation. For this substrate:\n- A 1,2-hydride shift from $C_2$ or $C_6$ to $C_1$ would relocate the positive charge from $C_1$ to $C_2$ or $C_6$. Each of those centers is bonded to only two carbons ($C_1$ and the next ring carbon), so the resulting carbocation would be secondary, which is less stable than the original tertiary carbocation. Such a shift is therefore disfavored.\n- A 1,2-alkyl shift from $C_2$ or $C_6$ would likewise place the positive charge on $C_2$ or $C_6$, again producing a secondary carbocation, which is less stable than the starting tertiary carbocation. Migration of the methyl group from $C_1$ is not the relevant 1,2-shift because the migrating group in a 1,2-rearrangement originates from the adjacent carbon, not from the cationic center itself. Ring expansion pathways that would improve stability are not available here without first passing through a less stable secondary cation, making them unfavorable.\n\nThe alternative explanations are not applicable: the cyclohexane chair does not inherently block 1,2-shifts; there is no bridgehead cation issue (Bredt’s rule is irrelevant); the reaction does proceed by $S_N1$ (so it is not inhibited by steric bulk of the leaving group), and the C–Br bond is not exceptionally strengthened by hyperconjugation in a way that contradicts the observed $S_N1$ process.\n\nTherefore, the absence of rearrangement products is best explained by the fact that the initially formed tertiary carbocation would rearrange only to less stable secondary carbocations, so rearrangement is disfavored.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2157962"}]}
