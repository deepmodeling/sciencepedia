The stereospecific nature of the $S_N2$ reaction provides a powerful tool for this purpose. This practice explores a classic synthetic strategy where two consecutive $S_N2$ reactions—each causing an inversion of stereochemistry—result in an overall retention of configuration, a key tactic for manipulating chiral centers [@problem_id:2202712].", "problem": "An organic chemist is conducting a synthetic sequence starting with an enantiomerically pure sample of (R)-2-butanol.\n\nIn the first step, the alcohol is reacted with thionyl chloride ($SOCl_2$) in the presence of pyridine. This reaction converts the alcohol into 2-chlorobutane.\n\nIn the second step, the purified 2-chlorobutane from the first step is dissolved in dimethylformamide, a polar aprotic solvent, and treated with sodium acetate ($CH_3COONa$). The major product of this reaction is 2-acetoxybutane, also known as sec-butyl acetate.\n\nGiven the standard mechanisms for these reactions, determine the stereochemical configuration of the final 2-acetoxybutane product.\n\nA. The product is exclusively (R)-2-acetoxybutane.\n\nB. The product is exclusively (S)-2-acetoxybutane.\n\nC. The product is a racemic mixture of (R)- and (S)-2-acetoxybutane.\n\nD. The final product is a meso compound and is achiral.", "solution": "Starting material and CIP priorities:\n- The substrate is enantiomerically pure $(R)$-2-butanol, i.e., $\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH(OH)CH}_2\\text{CH}_3$ with one stereogenic center at C2. For $(R)$-2-butanol, the Cahn–Ingold–Prelog (CIP) priority order at C2 is: OH (highest, due to O), then ethyl (–CH$_{2}$CH$_{3}$), then methyl (–CH$_{3}$), with H being lowest.\n\nStep 1: Conversion of alcohol to chloride with SOCl$_{2}$ in pyridine.\n- Mechanistic principle: In the presence of pyridine, SOCl$_{2}$ converts the alcohol to the corresponding alkyl chloride via formation of an alkyl chlorosulfite intermediate followed by an $S_{\\mathrm{N}}2$ displacement by Cl$^{-}$ with backside attack. This step is stereospecific and proceeds with inversion of configuration at the stereogenic center. The competing $S_{\\mathrm{Ni}}$ (retention) pathway is characteristic of SOCl$_{2}$ without a base; pyridine suppresses $S_{\\mathrm{Ni}}$ and promotes $S_{\\mathrm{N}}2$.\n- Stereochemical consequence: $(R)$-2-butanol undergoes one inversion to give 2-chlorobutane with the opposite configuration at C2. For 2-chlorobutane, the CIP priorities at C2 are: Cl (highest), then ethyl, then methyl, with H lowest. This ordering is analogous to the alcohol case in that the heteroatom substituent remains highest and the carbon substituents rank ethyl above methyl. Therefore, one $S_{\\mathrm{N}}2$ inversion converts $(R)$ to $(S)$, yielding $(S)$-2-chlorobutane.\n\nStep 2: Nucleophilic substitution with sodium acetate in DMF.\n- Reaction conditions: DMF is a polar aprotic solvent, which enhances nucleophilicity and favors bimolecular substitutions. Sodium acetate (CH$_{3}$COO$^{-}$) is a nucleophile that will attack secondary alkyl chlorides under these conditions via $S_{\\mathrm{N}}2$.\n- Mechanistic principle: The substitution proceeds via a single backside attack at C2 with a concerted transition state, giving inversion of configuration and forming the ester 2-acetoxybutane (sec-butyl acetate).\n- Stereochemical consequence: Starting from $(S)$-2-chlorobutane, one $S_{\\mathrm{N}}2$ inversion gives $(R)$-2-acetoxybutane. For 2-acetoxybutane, the CIP priorities at C2 are: OAc (highest, due to O), then ethyl, then methyl, with H lowest, matching the relative ranking pattern used above. Thus, inversion at C2 converts $(S)$ to $(R)$.\n\nOverall stereochemical outcome:\n- Two consecutive $S_{\\mathrm{N}}2$ inversions (first with SOCl$_{2}$/pyridine, then with acetate in DMF) give net retention relative to the starting $(R)$-2-butanol, and because the substituent change preserves the CIP priority pattern (heteroatom group highest, ethyl second, methyl third), the absolute configuration of the final product is $(R)$.\n- There is no carbocation formation or $S_{\\mathrm{N}}1$ pathway under the stated conditions, so no racemization occurs. The product has a single stereogenic center and cannot be meso.\n\nTherefore, the major (and exclusive, under these stereospecific conditions) product is $(R)$-2-acetoxybutane.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2202712"}, {"introduction": "The reactivity of molecules is not just determined by their connectivity, but also by their dynamic three-dimensional shape. This exercise challenges you to apply your knowledge of the $S_N2$ mechanism within the conformationally restricted environment of a cyclohexane ring.

In a 1,4-disubstituted cyclohexane, a cis relationship requires one substituent axial and the other equatorial on the same face (both up or both down) in a given chair. Because the tert-butyl group has a very strong preference for an equatorial position due to steric bulk, the most stable chair of cis-1-bromo-4-tert-butylcyclohexane places tert-butyl equatorial and, to maintain cis stereochemistry at 1,4, places bromine axial on the same face.\n\nAssess the feasibility of the $\\mathrm{S_{N}2}$ displacement. For secondary cyclohexyl halides, an efficient backside approach in $\\mathrm{S_{N}2}$ occurs when the leaving group is axial, which aligns the C–X bond along the appropriate trajectory for nucleophilic attack. In the preferred conformation identified above, bromine is axial, so the necessary stereoelectronic alignment is available and the reaction is not prohibitively slow.\n\nApply the stereochemical outcome of $\\mathrm{S_{N}2}$. The $\\mathrm{S_{N}2}$ mechanism proceeds with inversion at the reacting center (carbon 1). Starting from an axial substituent at C1 (bromine), inversion installs the incoming ethynyl group into the equatorial position on the opposite face. Thus, an axial-up bromine is replaced by an equatorial-down ethynyl group. Relative to the tert-butyl group at C4 (which remains equatorial on the original face), the product now has a trans-1,4 relationship between ethynyl and tert-butyl.\n\nDetermine the most stable chair conformation of the product. In a trans-1,4-disubstituted cyclohexane, a diequatorial arrangement is possible. Given the dominant equatorial preference of tert-butyl and the availability of an equatorial site for the ethynyl group, the lowest-energy conformation of the product is the trans isomer with both tert-butyl and ethynyl equatorial.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is: trans-1-ethynyl-4-tert-butylcyclohexane with the tert-butyl group equatorial and the ethynyl group equatorial.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2202764"}, {"introduction": "Symmetry within a molecule can lead to fascinating and sometimes counterintuitive stereochemical results.
