Consider the molecule 1-deutero-1-methylcyclohexane, where one hydrogen atom on the same carbon as the methyl group has been replaced by its heavier isotope, deuterium (D).\n\nLike cyclohexane, this molecule exists predominantly in two interconverting chair conformations. In one conformation, the methyl group ($-\\text{CH}_3$) is in an axial position and the deuterium atom (D) is in an equatorial position. In the other conformation, the methyl group is equatorial and the deuterium atom is axial.\n\nThe energetic cost of placing a substituent in an axial position versus an equatorial one is known as its conformational energy or A-value. A larger A-value indicates a greater steric penalty for being in the axial position.
