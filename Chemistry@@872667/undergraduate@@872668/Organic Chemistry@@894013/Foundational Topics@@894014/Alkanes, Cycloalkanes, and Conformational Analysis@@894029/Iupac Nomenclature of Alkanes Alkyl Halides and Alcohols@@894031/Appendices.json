This foundational step can sometimes be deceptive, especially with branched structures. This first practice [@problem_id:2181112] is designed to highlight a classic pitfall where the most straightforward-looking chain is not actually the longest, sharpening your skills in correctly applying this primary rule.", "problem": "A student in an introductory organic chemistry lab attempts to name a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon. Following the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) nomenclature rules they have learned, they incorrectly identify the longest carbon chain, leading them to propose the name \"2-ethylbutane\". Based on the molecular structure that corresponds to the name 2-ethylbutane, what is the correct systematic IUPAC name for this compound? Choose from the options below.\n\nA. 2-ethylbutane\n\nB. 3-methylpentane\n\nC. 3-ethylbutane\n\nD. 2-propylpropane\n\nE. Isohexane", "solution": "We interpret the proposed name \"2-ethylbutane\" as describing a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon consisting of a butane backbone (four carbons in a continuous chain) with an ethyl substituent attached to carbon 2 of that backbone. This gives a total of six carbons.\n\nBy IUPAC rules, the correct parent hydrocarbon is determined by the longest continuous carbon chain:\n- Consider the connectivity around the branching carbon (the butane C2 to which the ethyl is attached). From that branching carbon, there are three routes: toward the butane end that is one carbon long, toward the other butane end that is two carbons long, and into the ethyl substituent that is two carbons long.\n- The longest continuous chain is obtained by traversing from the terminal carbon of the ethyl group through the branching carbon and then continuing to the far end of the butane chain, yielding a chain of five carbons. An explicit path is: terminal ethyl carbon → adjacent ethyl carbon (the one bonded to the branch point) → branch point (former butane C2) → next carbon along the butane chain → terminal butane carbon. This path contains five distinct carbons, so the parent hydrocarbon is pentane.\n\nNext, identify and locate the substituent(s) not included in this five-carbon parent:\n- The carbon omitted from the five-carbon chain is the terminal carbon on the short, one-carbon side of the original butane (the carbon attached directly to the branch point on the side with only one carbon). This is a methyl substituent attached to the central carbon of the five-carbon chain.\n- Number the pentane chain from either end to give the lowest possible locant for the substituent. Numbering in either direction places the substituent on carbon 3, because the chain is symmetric with respect to the branch point in this construction.\n\nTherefore, the correct IUPAC name is 3-methylpentane, which corresponds to option B. The other options are incorrect: A repeats the initial incorrect name; C uses an ethyl on a four-carbon parent, violating the longest-chain rule; D suggests a different connectivity; E is a non-systematic common name and does not match this structure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2181112"}, {"introduction": "After identifying the parent chain, the next step is to number it to assign the lowest possible locants to the substituents. But what happens when numbering from either direction results in the exact same set of locants?

The positions of substitution are 3 and 5, and this set of locants is the same irrespective of the direction of numbering along the main chain. Therefore, the lowest set of locants criterion yields a tie: {3,5} versus {3,5}.\n\nApply the IUPAC tie-breaking rule: when the lowest set of locants is identical from either end, assign the lower locant to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order (ignoring multiplicative prefixes). Comparing the names of the substituents, \"ethyl\" precedes \"methyl\" alphabetically. Therefore, assign the lower number, 3, to the ethyl group and the higher number, 5, to the methyl group.\n\nAssemble the name with substituents listed in alphabetical order, each with its assigned locant: the correct name is 3-ethyl-5-methylheptane.\n\nCheck against options: this corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2181116"}, {"introduction": "Systematic nomenclature is more than just an abstract exercise; it's a precise language for describing molecular architecture. This final challenge [@problem_id:2181046] integrates naming with other core chemical concepts.
