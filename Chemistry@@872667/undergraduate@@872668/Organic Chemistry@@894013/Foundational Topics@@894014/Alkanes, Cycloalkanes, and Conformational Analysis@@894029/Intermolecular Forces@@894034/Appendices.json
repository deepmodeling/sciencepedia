Consider three organic molecules of similar size: ethane ($CH_3CH_3$), a simple alkane; acetaldehyde ($CH_3CHO$), an intermediate in ethanol metabolism; and acetic acid ($CH_3COOH$), a key metabolite and the active component of vinegar. While their molar masses are comparable, their boiling points differ significantly due to the nature of their intermolecular interactions in a pure liquid state.\n\nBased on an analysis of the predominant intermolecular forces that each molecule can form, predict the correct order of their boiling points.

Acetaldehyde < Acetic Acid < Ethane", "solution": "Boiling point at a given external pressure increases with the strength and extent of intermolecular forces in the pure liquid, because stronger attractions require more energy (larger enthalpy of vaporization) to separate molecules into the gas phase.\n\nIdentify the predominant intermolecular forces for each molecule:\n- Ethane, $CH_{3}CH_{3}$, is a nonpolar alkane with only London dispersion forces. Among common intermolecular interactions, London dispersion is the weakest, and for molecules of comparable size, these forces are relatively small.\n- Acetaldehyde, $CH_{3}CHO$, possesses a polar carbonyl group. In the pure liquid it exhibits permanent dipole-dipole interactions in addition to London dispersion. It lacks an $O\\text{-}H$ or $N\\text{-}H$ bond, so it cannot donate hydrogen bonds to itself in the pure liquid; thus hydrogen bonding is not a dominant self-interaction for acetaldehyde.\n- Acetic acid, $CH_{3}COOH$, contains both a carbonyl and an $O\\text{-}H$ group. In the pure liquid, carboxylic acids form strong, cyclic hydrogen-bonded dimers via two $O\\text{-}H \\cdots O$ hydrogen bonds, significantly strengthening intermolecular attractions beyond simple dipole-dipole and dispersion forces and effectively increasing the interacting unit’s size.\n\nStrength comparison of dominant interactions for molecules of similar size is:\n$$\\text{London dispersion} < \\text{dipole-dipole} < \\text{hydrogen bonding (carboxylic acid dimers)}.$$\n\nTherefore, the boiling points must follow:\n$$BP(\\text{ethane}) < BP(\\text{acetaldehyde}) < BP(\\text{acetic acid}).$$\n\nMatching the options, this is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2052641"}, {"introduction": "While the type of intermolecular force is crucial, the overall shape of a molecule introduces another layer of complexity. This practice explores the counterintuitive case of two isomers, n-pentane and neopentane, to distinguish how molecular surface area affects boiling point versus how molecular symmetry governs the efficiency of packing into a crystal lattice, which determines the melting point ([@problem_id:2177496]). This problem highlights the nuanced thinking required to analyze different phase transitions.", "problem": "An undergraduate student is tasked with identifying two unlabeled liquid samples, designated Compound P and Compound Q. The student is informed that the samples are constitutional isomers with the molecular formula $C_5H_{12}$. One is n-pentane, and the other is 2,2-dimethylpropane, also known as neopentane. The student performs a careful measurement of their boiling points and melting points, obtaining the following data:\n\n*   **Compound P**: Boiling Point = 9.5 °C; Melting Point = -16.6 °C\n*   **Compound Q**: Boiling Point = 36.1 °C; Melting Point = -129.7 °C\n\nBased on the principles of intermolecular forces and molecular structure, which of the following statements provides the most accurate identification of the compounds and the correct reasoning for the observed differences in both their boiling and melting points?\n\nA. Compound P is n-pentane and Compound Q is neopentane. The lower boiling point of n-pentane is due to its chain flexibility. The higher melting point of neopentane is due to its rigid, branched structure which promotes stronger intermolecular attractions in the solid state.\n\nB. Compound P is neopentane and Compound Q is n-pentane. The lower boiling point of neopentane arises because its compact, spherical shape reduces the available surface area for contact between molecules, leading to weaker London dispersion forces. Its higher melting point is a result of its high symmetry, which allows for very efficient packing into a crystal lattice, making the solid state unusually stable.\n\nC. Compound P is neopentane and Compound Q is n-pentane. Both the lower boiling point and the higher melting point of neopentane are a consequence of its compact shape leading to weaker intermolecular forces compared to n-pentane.\n\nD. Compound P is n-pentane and Compound Q is neopentane. The trends are reversed from what is expected; n-pentane's larger size should lead to a higher melting point, and neopentane's compact structure should lead to a higher boiling point due to density effects.\n\nE. Compound P is neopentane and Compound Q is n-pentane. The lower boiling point of neopentane is due to weaker London dispersion forces associated with its smaller surface area. Its higher melting point is due to stronger dipole-dipole interactions that are only present in the solid phase.", "solution": "The problem requires us to identify two isomers, n-pentane and neopentane, based on their given boiling and melting points, and to select the correct physical-chemical explanation for these properties.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the molecular structures.**\nBoth n-pentane and neopentane (2,2-dimethylpropane) have the same molecular formula, $C_5H_{12}$. This means they have the same molar mass, and any differences in physical properties must arise from their different shapes.\n*   **n-pentane**: A straight-chain alkane, its molecule is long, linear, and flexible.\n*   **neopentane**: A branched-chain alkane, its molecule is highly compact and symmetrical, approaching a spherical shape.\n\nSince both molecules are nonpolar alkanes, the only intermolecular forces present are London dispersion forces (a type of van der Waals force).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the boiling point trend.**\nBoiling is the process of transitioning from the liquid phase to the gas phase. This requires overcoming the intermolecular forces holding the molecules together in the liquid. The strength of London dispersion forces depends on the polarizability of the electron cloud and the surface area available for intermolecular contact.\n*   n-pentane's long, chain-like shape provides a large surface area for contact with neighboring molecules. This allows for stronger, more extensive London dispersion forces.\n*   neopentane's compact, spherical shape minimizes its surface area. This reduces the area of contact between molecules, resulting in weaker London dispersion forces.\n\nTherefore, more energy is required to separate n-pentane molecules than neopentane molecules. This means n-pentane should have a higher boiling point than neopentane.\nComparing the data: Compound Q has a boiling point of 36.1 °C, while Compound P has a boiling point of 9.5 °C. Thus, **Compound Q must be n-pentane**, and **Compound P must be neopentane**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the melting point trend.**\nMelting is the process of transitioning from the ordered solid (crystal lattice) to the less-ordered liquid phase. The energy required, and thus the melting point, depends on two main factors: the strength of the intermolecular forces and the efficiency of packing in the crystal lattice.\n*   n-pentane, being a flexible and somewhat awkward shape, does not pack very efficiently into a crystal lattice. There are gaps and inefficiencies in the solid structure.\n*   neopentane, due to its high degree of symmetry (it's nearly spherical), can pack very neatly and efficiently into a crystal lattice, similar to the way marbles pack in a box. This efficient packing leads to a very stable and well-ordered solid structure.\n\nAlthough the individual intermolecular forces are weaker for neopentane, the energy required to break down its highly ordered and stable crystal lattice is significantly greater than the energy required to melt the less-efficiently packed n-pentane solid.\nTherefore, neopentane should have a higher melting point than n-pentane.\nComparing the data: Compound P has a melting point of -16.6 °C, while Compound Q has a melting point of -129.7 °C. The much higher melting point of Compound P confirms that it is neopentane, and the much lower melting point of Compound Q confirms it is n-pentane. This aligns with our conclusion from Step 2.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the given options.**\n*   **A**: Incorrectly identifies P as n-pentane and Q as neopentane.\n*   **B**: Correctly identifies P as neopentane and Q as n-pentane. It correctly explains the lower boiling point of neopentane as due to its smaller surface area and weaker London dispersion forces. It correctly explains the higher melting point of neopentane as due to its high symmetry allowing for efficient crystal lattice packing. This statement is entirely correct.\n*   **C**: Correctly identifies the compounds but provides an incorrect explanation for the melting point. Weaker forces alone would suggest a lower, not higher, melting point. It misses the crucial concept of packing efficiency.\n*   **D**: Incorrectly identifies the compounds and provides incorrect reasoning.\n*   **E**: Correctly identifies the compounds and the reason for the boiling point difference. However, it incorrectly attributes the melting point trend to dipole-dipole interactions, which do not exist in these nonpolar molecules.\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis, statement B is the only one that correctly identifies both compounds and provides the correct physical-chemical reasoning for both boiling point and melting point trends.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2177496"}, {"introduction": "Intermolecular forces don't just determine boiling points; they dictate the three-dimensional structure of matter and give rise to unique physical properties. By examining why ice is less dense than liquid water, this final exercise provides a powerful real-world application of hydrogen bonding, connecting its highly directional nature to the macroscopic structure of a substance essential for life ([@problem_id:2177431]). This case beautifully illustrates how microscopic interactions have profound macroscopic consequences.", "problem": "Water exhibits an unusual property: its solid form, ice, is less dense than its liquid form. This anomaly is fundamental to life on Earth, as it allows ice to float and insulate bodies of water. The explanation for this lies in the nature of the intermolecular forces between water molecules, specifically hydrogen bonding. A water molecule ($H_2O$) consists of a central oxygen atom covalently bonded to two hydrogen atoms, and the oxygen atom also possesses two lone pairs of electrons. This configuration allows a single water molecule to act as a donor for two hydrogen bonds (via its H atoms) and an acceptor for two hydrogen bonds (via its O atom's lone pairs).\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and complete explanation for why crystalline ice at 0°C is less dense than liquid water at 4°C?\n\nA. In liquid water, molecules have higher kinetic energy, which causes the hydrogen bonds to break and reform rapidly. This transient nature of the bonds is the primary factor that allows molecules to approach each other more closely than in the fixed, rigid lattice of ice.\n\nB. Each water molecule in the ice lattice forms strong, directional hydrogen bonds with exactly four neighboring molecules in a fixed tetrahedral geometry, creating a highly ordered but open, cage-like structure with significant empty space.\n\nC. When ice melts, the ordered crystalline lattice collapses. In the resulting liquid state, the water molecules are disordered and can pack more closely together, so that on average, each molecule is surrounded by slightly more than four neighbors at varying distances.\n\nD. Both statement B and statement C are correct and are necessary components for a complete explanation of the density difference.\n\nE. The covalent O-H bonds within the water molecules are slightly longer in the solid phase compared to the liquid phase, causing each molecule to occupy a larger volume in ice.", "solution": "We seek the most accurate and complete explanation for why crystalline ice at 0 degrees Celsius is less dense than liquid water at 4 degrees Celsius. Density is defined by\n$$\n\\rho=\\frac{m}{V},\n$$\nso, for a given amount of substance (fixed mass), a lower density corresponds to a larger volume per molecule (or larger molar volume).\n\nThe key intermolecular interaction is hydrogen bonding. Each water molecule can donate two hydrogen bonds (via its two hydrogen atoms) and accept two hydrogen bonds (via two lone pairs on oxygen), allowing up to four hydrogen bonds per molecule. In the crystalline ice lattice (ice Ih), each water molecule forms strong, directional hydrogen bonds with exactly four nearest neighbors in a tetrahedral arrangement. This fixed tetrahedral geometry enforces an open network with significant void space, which increases the volume per molecule. Symbolically, if $z$ denotes the coordination number, then in ice $z_{\\text{ice}}=4$, and the tetrahedral arrangement creates an open, cage-like structure. Consequently,\n$$\nV_{\\text{ice}} > V_{\\text{water}},\n$$\nso\n$$\n\\rho_{\\text{ice}} < \\rho_{\\text{water}}.\n$$\n\nUpon melting, the ordered tetrahedral network collapses: hydrogen bonds become transient and reconfigure continuously, which reduces the fraction of open cavities. The liquid retains hydrogen bonding, but the network is disordered, with a distribution of intermolecular distances and angles, allowing molecules to pack more closely. On average, the effective local coordination becomes slightly greater than four, i.e.,\n$$\nz_{\\text{liquid}} > 4 \\quad \\text{(on average)},\n$$\nwith neighbors at varying distances, and thus the molar volume decreases relative to ice. Around 4 degrees Celsius, the competition between residual tetrahedral structuring and ordinary thermal expansion yields the maximum density of liquid water.\n\nEvaluating the statements:\n- Statement B is correct: it identifies the strong, directional, tetrahedral hydrogen-bond network in ice that creates an open structure with significant empty space, explaining why ice has a larger volume per molecule.\n- Statement C is also correct: it explains that melting collapses the open lattice, increasing local packing and the average number of neighbors at varying distances, making the liquid denser.\n- Statement A is incomplete: while the transient nature of hydrogen bonds in the liquid is relevant, it does not explicitly connect to the open tetrahedral framework in ice nor to the increased effective coordination in the liquid; thus it is not the most complete explanation.\n- Statement E is incorrect: the density difference is not due to significant changes in the intramolecular O–H covalent bond length between phases; it is governed by intermolecular structure.\n\nTherefore, both B and C are correct and together provide the most accurate and complete explanation, so the correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2177431"}]}
