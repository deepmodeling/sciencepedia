The geometry around an sp-hybridized carbon is linear.\n    *   The terminal carbons (C1 and C3) are sp$^2$-hybridized. The geometry around an sp$^2$-hybridized carbon is trigonal planar.\n    *   The two pi bonds associated with the central carbon atom are formed from its two unhybridized p orbitals (let's say $p_y$ and $p_z$). The pi bond between C1 and C2 might use the $p_y$ orbital, while the pi bond between C2 and C3 must use the perpendicular $p_z$ orbital. This forces the plane of the substituents on C1 (Cl and H) to be perpendicular to the plane of the substituents on C3 (Cl and H).\n\n2.  **Visualization in a Coordinate System**: Let's place the $\\text{C=C=C}$ backbone along the x-axis, with the central carbon C2 at the origin (0,0,0).\n    *   Let C1 be at (-d, 0, 0) and C3 be at (+d, 0, 0).\n    *   Since the substituents on C1 are in a plane perpendicular to the substituents on C3, we can place the C1 substituents in the xy-plane and the C3 substituents in the xz-plane.\n    *   On C1, the chlorine atom can be placed in the +y direction and the hydrogen atom in the -y direction.\n    *   On C3, the chlorine atom can be placed in the +z direction and the hydrogen atom in the -z direction.\n    *   (Note: The specific assignments of Cl to +y/+z are arbitrary, but the perpendicular relationship is fixed. Choosing any other valid arrangement, such as Cl on C1 in the +y direction and Cl on C3 in the -z direction, will lead to the same conclusion about overall polarity.)\n\n3.  **Analysis of Bond Dipoles**: The polarity of the molecule is determined by the vector sum of its bond dipoles. The most significant bond dipoles are the C-Cl bonds, as chlorine is much more electronegative than carbon. The C-H bond dipoles are much smaller and can be considered for a more precise analysis, but the C-Cl dipoles are dominant.\n    *   The bond dipole for the C1-Cl bond, $\\vec{\\mu}_1$, points from C1 towards the Cl atom. In our coordinate system, this vector points primarily in the +y direction.

The bond dipoles are not opposite in direction; they are approximately perpendicular. Therefore, they cannot cancel.\n    *   B: Correct. The perpendicular orientation of the two C-Cl bond dipoles ensures that their vector sum is non-zero, making the molecule polar.\n    *   C: Incorrect. While the carbon backbone is linear, the overall molecule is not linear or symmetric in a way that allows for dipole cancellation due to the perpendicular arrangement of the substituents.\n    *   D: Incorrect. This is an oversimplification. While C-Cl bonds are polar, their geometric arrangement can lead to a nonpolar molecule if they cancel, as in carbon tetrachloride ($\\text{CCl}_4$). Geometry is always critical.\n    *   E: Incorrect. An allene with this substitution pattern ($\\text{A-CH=C=CH-A}$) does not possess a center of inversion. A center of inversion would require that for any atom at (x,y,z), an identical atom exists at (-x,-y,-z). This is not the case here. For example, the Cl at approx (-d, y_0, 0) does not have a corresponding Cl at (d, -y_0, 0).
