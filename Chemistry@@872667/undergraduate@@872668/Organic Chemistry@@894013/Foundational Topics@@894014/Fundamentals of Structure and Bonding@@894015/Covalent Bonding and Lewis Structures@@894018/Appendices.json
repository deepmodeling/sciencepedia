Acetic acid is $\\mathrm{CH_{3}COOH}$, which is a methyl group attached to a carboxyl group. Thus there are two carbons: the methyl carbon (call it $C_{1}$) bonded to three hydrogens and to the carboxyl carbon (call it $C_{2}$). The carboxyl carbon $C_{2}$ is bonded to two oxygens: one carbonyl oxygen and one hydroxyl oxygen that also bears an H.\n\n2) Enforce typical valences and the octet rule:\n- Carbon is tetravalent (aiming for an octet via four bonds). Thus $C_{1}$ forms $4$ single bonds: $3$ C–H and $1$ C–C to $C_{2}$.\n- To give $C_{2}$ an octet while minimizing formal charges, $C_{2}$ forms a double bond to one oxygen (the carbonyl O) and a single bond to the hydroxyl O, plus the single bond to $C_{1}$. This yields one $C{=}\\!O$ double bond and one $C{-}O$ single bond in the carboxyl group.\n- The hydroxyl O is single-bonded to $C_{2}$ and to H (two single bonds total), and to satisfy the octet it carries two lone pairs.\n- The carbonyl O is double-bonded to $C_{2}$ and carries two lone pairs to satisfy its octet.\n- Hydrogens each make one single bond and carry no lone pairs; carbons carry no lone pairs in this neutral structure.\n\n3) Verify minimal formal charges to justify the bonding pattern:\nFor an atom $X$, the formal charge is $F_{X} = V_{X} - (N_{X} + \\frac{1}{2}B_{X})$, where $V_{X}$ is the number of valence electrons, $N_{X}$ the number of nonbonding electrons, and $B_{X}$ the number of bonding electrons.\n- Carbonyl O: $V_{O} = 6$, choose $N_{O} = 4$ (two lone pairs), $B_{O} = 4$ (double bond). Then $F_{O} = 6 - (4 + \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 4) = 6 - (4 + 2) = 0$.\n- Hydroxyl O: $V_{O} = 6$, choose $N_{O} = 4$ (two lone pairs), $B_{O} = 4$ (two single bonds to $C$ and $H$). Then $F_{O} = 6 - (4 + \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 4) = 0$.\nThus the structure has zero formal charges on the oxygens and satisfies the octet rule.\n\n4) Count bonds and lone pairs in the molecule:\n- Single bonds: 3 C-H bonds, 1 C-C bond, 1 C-O bond, and 1 O-H bond. Total single bonds = $3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6$.\n- Double bonds: one $C_{2}{=}\\!O_{\\text{(carbonyl)}}$. Total double bonds $= 1$.\n- Lone pairs: each oxygen has $2$ lone pairs; there are $2$ oxygens, so total lone pairs $= 2 + 2 = 4$.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is $6$ single bonds, $1$ double bond, and $4$ lone pairs, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1292008"}, {"introduction": "Building on basic structure drawing, this problem introduces a critical decision-making tool: the concept of formal charge.

For this molecule, the sulfur atom is the central atom, to which the oxygen atom and the two chlorine atoms are bonded.

A structure with a single bond between the sulfur and oxygen atoms, a double bond between the sulfur and one of the chlorine atoms, and a single bond between the sulfur and the other chlorine atom.", "solution": "To determine the most stable Lewis structure for thionyl chloride ($SOCl_2$), we follow a systematic process involving calculating the total number of valence electrons and then evaluating each proposed structure based on the octet rule and formal charge minimization.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of valence electrons.**\nThe problem provides the number of valence electrons for each atom:\n- Sulfur (S): 1 atom × 6 valence electrons/atom = 6 electrons\n- Oxygen (O): 1 atom × 6 valence electrons/atom = 6 electrons\n- Chlorine (Cl): 2 atoms × 7 valence electrons/atom = 14 electrons\n\nTotal valence electrons = $6 + 6 + 14 = 26$ electrons.\nAny valid Lewis structure for $SOCl_2$ must contain exactly 26 valence electrons.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate each proposed structure.**\nThe general rule for stability is to choose the structure that minimizes the formal charges on all atoms. The formal charge (FC) for an atom in a Lewis structure is calculated as:\n$$FC = (\\text{Valence Electrons}) - (\\text{Non-bonding Electrons}) - \\frac{1}{2}(\\text{Bonding Electrons})$$\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\nThis structure has single bonds from S to O, and from S to each Cl. To satisfy the octet rule for all atoms, we distribute the remaining electrons as lone pairs.\n- Bonding electrons: 3 single bonds = $3 \\times 2 = 6$ electrons.\n- Remaining electrons for lone pairs: $26 - 6 = 20$ electrons.\n- To satisfy the octet rule for the peripheral atoms, O needs 3 lone pairs (6 e-) and each Cl needs 3 lone pairs (6 e-). Total: $6 + 6 + 6 = 18$ electrons.\n- The remaining $20 - 18 = 2$ electrons are placed on the central sulfur atom as one lone pair.\n- Let's check the octets: O has 1 bond + 3 lone pairs (8 e-), each Cl has 1 bond + 3 lone pairs (8 e-), and S has 3 bonds + 1 lone pair (8 e-). The octet rule is satisfied for all.\n- Now, we calculate formal charges:\n  - $FC(O) = 6 - 6 - \\frac{1}{2}(2) = -1$\n  - $FC(Cl) = 7 - 6 - \\frac{1}{2}(2) = 0$\n  - $FC(S) = 6 - 2 - \\frac{1}{2}(6) = +1$\nThis structure has a formal charge of +1 on sulfur and -1 on oxygen. The presence of non-zero formal charges makes it less stable than a structure where charges are minimized.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\nThis structure has one S=O double bond and two S-Cl single bonds. The sulfur atom has one lone pair.\n- Bonding electrons: 1 double bond (4 e-) + 2 single bonds (4 e-) = 8 electrons.\n- To check the total electron count: We place lone pairs to satisfy octets for peripheral atoms. The double-bonded O needs 2 lone pairs (4 e-). Each single-bonded Cl needs 3 lone pairs (6 e-). Sulfur is stated to have one lone pair (2 e-).\n- Total electrons = 8 (bonding) + 4 (on O) + 2 $\\times$ 6 (on Cls) + 2 (on S) = $8 + 4 + 12 + 2 = 26$ electrons. This matches the total valence electron count.\n- Now, we calculate formal charges:\n  - $FC(O) = 6 - 4 - \\frac{1}{2}(4) = 0$\n  - $FC(Cl) = 7 - 6 - \\frac{1}{2}(2) = 0$\n  - $FC(S) = 6 - 2 - \\frac{1}{2}(8) = 0$\nAll atoms have a formal charge of 0. The central sulfur atom has an \"expanded octet\" with 10 valence electrons (8 from bonds + 2 from a lone pair). This is permissible because sulfur is in the 3rd period of the periodic table. A structure with zero formal charges on all atoms is highly favorable and generally represents the most stable arrangement.\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\nThis structure proposes one S=O double bond and two S=Cl double bonds.\n- Bonding electrons = 3 double bonds = $3 \\times 4 = 12$ electrons.\n- To satisfy octets on peripheral atoms: O needs 2 lone pairs (4 e-), and each Cl needs 2 lone pairs (4 e-). Total lone pair electrons = $4 + 4 + 4 = 12$ electrons.\n- The total electron count would be 12 (bonding) + 12 (lone pairs) = 24. This does not match the required 26 valence electrons. Thus, this structure is invalid.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\nThis structure has one S-O single bond, one S=Cl double bond, and one S-Cl single bond.\n- Let's assume octets are satisfied and calculate formal charges for this arrangement. To have 26 electrons: O (single bond) requires 3 lone pairs. Cl (double bond) requires 2 lone pairs. Cl (single bond) requires 3 lone pairs. S (1 single, 1 double, 1 single) would need 1 lone pair to get an octet. Total electrons would be: 8 (bonding) + 6(O) + 4(Cl=) + 6(Cl-) + 2(S) = 26 electrons.\n- Formal Charges:\n  - $FC(O) = 6 - 6 - \\frac{1}{2}(2) = -1$\n  - $FC(Cl, \\text{double}) = 7 - 4 - \\frac{1}{2}(4) = +1$\n  - $FC(Cl, \\text{single}) = 7 - 6 - \\frac{1}{2}(2) = 0$\n  - $FC(S) = 6 - 2 - \\frac{1}{2}(8) = 0$\nThis structure has charge separation, with a -1 charge on oxygen and a +1 charge on a chlorine atom. Placing a positive formal charge on a highly electronegative atom like chlorine is extremely unfavorable. This makes the structure much less stable than both A and B.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nComparing the valid structures derived from the options, Option B results in a Lewis structure where all atoms have a formal charge of zero. This is the most significant factor in determining the stability of a Lewis structure when comparing an octet-rule-compliant structure with formal charges (Option A) and an expanded-octet structure with zero formal charges (Option B).

Structure III is easily dismissed as the least significant contributor due to its large formal charges and charge separation.\n\nThe choice between Structure I and Structure II is more nuanced. A common guideline is to place a negative charge on the most electronegative atom, which would favor Structure II (charge on N). However, this rule is not absolute and other factors must be considered. Structure I features an exceptionally stable C≡N triple bond. Furthermore, sulfur, as a larger and more polarizable atom from the third period, is highly capable of stabilizing a negative charge. Due to the combined effects of the strong triple bond and sulfur's ability to accommodate a negative charge, Structure I is considered the most significant contributor to the resonance hybrid of the thiocyanate ion. Experimental evidence from bond lengths also supports this conclusion. Therefore, Structure I is the major resonance contributor.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2164088"}]}
