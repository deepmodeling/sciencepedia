One of the most direct applications of resonance theory is in predicting and explaining variations in bond lengths. This practice [@problem_id:2197304] challenges you to connect the abstract concept of electron delocalization to a tangible structural property by comparing the carbon-nitrogen bond in urea with that in a simple amine, forcing you to consider how partial bond character influences bond length.", "problem": "Urea, with the chemical formula $\\text{CO(NH}_2)_2$, is a simple organic molecule that plays a crucial role in the metabolism of nitrogen-containing compounds by animals and is widely used as a nitrogen-release fertilizer. Consider the carbon-nitrogen (C-N) bond within the urea molecule. Compare its length to the C-N bond in methylamine, $\\text{CH}_3\\text{NH}_2$, a simple amine where a methyl group is attached to an amino group. Based on fundamental principles of chemical bonding, select the correct statement from the options below.\n\nA. The C-N bond in urea is shorter than the C-N bond in methylamine.\n\nB. The C-N bond in urea is longer than the C-N bond in methylamine.\n\nC. The C-N bonds in urea and methylamine have approximately the same length.\n\nD. It is impossible to predict the relative bond lengths without experimental data.", "solution": "We compare the C-N bond in methylamine and urea using fundamental bonding principles.\n\nIn methylamine, $\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{NH}_{2}$, the C-N bond is a localized single $\\sigma$ bond between approximately $sp^{3}$ hybrid orbitals on carbon and nitrogen with no conjugation to a $\\pi$ system. Thus, the bond order is $n_{\\text{methylamine}}=1$.\n\nIn urea, $O=C(NH_{2})_{2}$, each nitrogen has a lone pair that can delocalize into the carbonyl $\\pi$ system. The key resonance forms are\n$$\nO=C(NH_{2})_{2} \\leftrightarrow O^{-}-C(=NH_{2}^{+})(NH_{2}) \\leftrightarrow O^{-}-C(NH_{2})(=NH_{2}^{+}),\n$$\nwhich distribute partial double-bond character over both C-N bonds.

The key principle is that the strength of an acid is directly related to the stability of its conjugate base. In this exercise [@problem_id:2197325], you will assess the relative acidity of acetone and acetonitrile, which requires not only drawing resonance structures for their conjugate bases but also evaluating which structure provides greater stabilization by considering the electronegativity of the atoms bearing the negative charge.", "problem": "In synthetic organic chemistry, the formation of a carbanion by deprotonating a carbon atom adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group is a fundamental step. Consider two common laboratory solvents, acetone ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{COCH}_3$) and acetonitrile ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{CN}$), both of which possess protons on a carbon atom adjacent to a multiply bonded functional group (an $\\alpha$-proton).\n\nIf each compound is treated separately with the same strong base under identical conditions, which compound would be expected to be more readily deprotonated to form its corresponding conjugate base? Select the option that correctly identifies the more acidic compound and provides the most accurate justification based on the stability of the resulting anion.\n\nA. Acetonitrile, because its conjugate base is stabilized by a resonance structure that places the negative charge on the nitrogen atom, which is very electronegative.\n\nB. Acetone, because its conjugate base is stabilized by a resonance structure that places the negative charge on the oxygen atom, which is more electronegative than nitrogen.\n\nC. Acetonitrile, because the nitrogen atom in the cyano group is sp-hybridized, making it more electronegative and better able to stabilize the negative charge through induction than the sp$^2$-hybridized oxygen in acetone.\n\nD. Acetone, because the inductive effect of its two methyl groups helps to stabilize the negative charge on the $\\alpha$-carbon of the conjugate base.\n\nE. Acetone and Acetonitrile are deprotonated at roughly the same rate, as both of their conjugate bases are stabilized by a resonance structure that delocalizes the negative charge onto an adjacent heteroatom.", "solution": "We are asked to determine which of two compounds, acetone ($\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{COCH}_{3}$) or acetonitrile ($\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{CN}$), is more readily deprotonated at the $\\alpha$-carbon by the same strong base under identical conditions. The appropriate criterion is the relative stability of the corresponding conjugate bases: the more stabilized conjugate base corresponds to the stronger acid (more readily deprotonated). In thermodynamic terms, for deprotonation $\\mathrm{HA + B^{-} \\rightleftharpoons A^{-} + HB}$, the stronger acid has a more stabilized $A^{-}$; equivalently, a more negative standard free energy change $\\Delta G^{\\circ} = -RT \\ln K$ corresponds to a larger equilibrium constant for deprotonation.\n\nFor acetone, removal of an $\\alpha$-proton gives the enolate anion. The enolate anion is stabilized by resonance that delocalizes the negative charge between the $\\alpha$-carbon and the carbonyl oxygen. A key resonance contributor places the negative charge on oxygen. Because oxygen is highly electronegative, this resonance form is especially stabilizing. Denoting electronegativities symbolically as $\\chi$, the ordering $\\chi_{\\mathrm{O}} > \\chi_{\\mathrm{N}} > \\chi_{\\mathrm{C}}$ implies that a resonance structure bearing negative charge on oxygen stabilizes the anion more effectively than structures placing charge on nitrogen or carbon. Thus, the acetone conjugate base benefits significantly from resonance delocalization onto oxygen.\n\nFor acetonitrile, removal of an $\\alpha$-proton gives the cyanomethyl anion. This anion can delocalize electron density into the $\\mathrm{C}\\equiv\\mathrm{N}$ group by resonance, leading to contributors that place negative charge primarily on carbon and, to a lesser extent, on nitrogen. Even considering that the nitrile nitrogen is $sp$-hybridized (which increases its effective electronegativity relative to $sp^{3}$ nitrogen), oxygen remains inherently more electronegative than nitrogen, i.e., $\\chi_{\\mathrm{O}} > \\chi_{\\mathrm{N}}$ regardless of hybridization differences. Consequently, the best resonance stabilization available to the nitrile-stabilized carbanion is intrinsically weaker than the enolate’s stabilization by oxygen.\n\nInductive effects do not overturn this conclusion: the methyl groups in acetone are weakly electron donating by induction, which would slightly destabilize a nearby negative charge rather than stabilize it, so they do not account for enhanced acidity. The dominant factor is resonance delocalization onto a more electronegative heteroatom. Both acetone and acetonitrile have resonance delocalization into adjacent multiple bonds, but only the acetone enolate places substantial negative charge on oxygen, which is more stabilizing than placing it on nitrogen or carbon.\n\nTherefore, the conjugate base of acetone is more stabilized than that of acetonitrile, so acetone is more acidic and is more readily deprotonated. This directly supports option B and contradicts the alternatives: A overstates nitrile stabilization by nitrogen relative to oxygen; C incorrectly claims an $sp$ nitrogen can out-stabilize an oxygen; D misstates the inductive effect of methyl groups; E ignores the significant difference in stabilization arising from the different heteroatoms.\n\nHence, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2197325"}, {"introduction": "Just as resonance stabilization of a conjugate base enhances acidity, the stabilization of a conjugate acid enhances basicity. A molecule can function as a surprisingly strong base if, upon accepting a proton, it forms a cation that is exceptionally stabilized by resonance. This practice [@problem_id:2197339] uses the classic example of guanidine to demonstrate this principle, asking you to determine the most favorable site of protonation by analyzing which resulting conjugate acid achieves the greatest degree of charge delocalization and stability.", "problem": "Guanidine is a neutral molecule with the chemical formula $\\text{CH}_5\\text{N}_3$. Its structure consists of a central carbon atom that is single-bonded to two equivalent amino groups ($-\\text{NH}_2$) and double-bonded to an imino group ($=\\text{NH}$). Guanidine is known to be a strong organic base. When it accepts a proton ($H^+$), it forms a cationic conjugate acid. Your task is to identify the most thermodynamically favorable site of protonation on the neutral guanidine molecule.\n\nChoose the correct statement:\nA. Protonation occurs on the nitrogen atom of the imino group.\n\nB. Protonation occurs on one of the nitrogen atoms of an amino group.\n\nC. Protonation occurs on the central carbon atom.\n\nD. The amino and imino nitrogens are equally basic and thus equally likely to be protonated.\n\nE. Protonation occurs on one of the hydrogen atoms.", "solution": "We identify the most thermodynamically favorable protonation site by comparing the relative stabilities of the possible conjugate acids formed upon protonation. In Lewis terms, the most basic site is the atom whose lone pair donation to $H^{+}$ yields the most stabilized cation. Stabilization is assessed primarily by resonance delocalization and charge distribution.\n\nThe neutral guanidine described has a central carbon single-bonded to two equivalent amino groups and double-bonded to an imino group, i.e., $\\text{(H}_{2}\\text{N)}_{2}\\text{C=NH}$. The potential protonation sites are: the imino nitrogen, either amino nitrogen, the central carbon, or a hydrogen atom.\n\n1) Protonation at the imino nitrogen:\n- If the imino nitrogen accepts $H^{+}$, the product is the guanidinium cation $\\mathrm{[C(NH_{2})_{3}]^{+}}$. In this cation, the positive charge is extensively delocalized by resonance over the three nitrogen atoms, and the three $\\mathrm{C{-}N}$ bonds become equivalent with partial double-bond character. There are three equivalent major resonance contributors interconverting by shifting the position of the formal double bond among the three $\\mathrm{C{-}N}$ links while relocating the formal positive charge among the three nitrogens. This extensive, symmetric delocalization provides maximal resonance stabilization for the conjugate acid, making the corresponding basic site (the imino nitrogen) the most basic.\n\n2) Protonation at an amino nitrogen:\n- If an amino nitrogen accepts $H^{+}$, that nitrogen becomes an $\\mathrm{NH_{3}^{+}}$ center without a lone pair, which disrupts its ability to donate electron density into the $\\mathrm{C{=}N}$ framework. As a result, resonance delocalization is significantly reduced and the positive charge is localized largely on the protonated amino nitrogen. The conjugate acid is therefore less stabilized than the guanidinium obtained by protonation at the imino nitrogen.\n\n3) Protonation at the central carbon:\n- Protonation at the carbon would place a positive charge in a way that does not benefit from the same extensive delocalization over three nitrogens. Such a carbenium- or iminium-like cation is much less stabilized relative to the guanidinium cation and is not the thermodynamically preferred outcome.\n\n4) Protonation at a hydrogen atom:\n- Hydrogen atoms are not Lewis basic sites (they have no lone pairs to donate), so protonation at hydrogen is not chemically meaningful as a site of basicity.\n\n5) Comparison of basicities of amino versus imino nitrogens:\n- Because protonation at the imino nitrogen uniquely yields the highly resonance-stabilized, symmetric guanidinium cation, the imino nitrogen is more basic than the amino nitrogens. Therefore, the amino and imino nitrogens are not equally basic.\n\nFrom these considerations, the most thermodynamically favorable protonation occurs at the imino nitrogen, yielding the resonance-stabilized guanidinium cation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2197339"}]}
