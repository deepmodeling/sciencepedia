Its C-1 carbon atom is prochiral, bearing two hydrogen atoms that are enantiotopic.\n\nA biochemist uses a hypothetical, stereospecific enzyme to catalyze the replacement of the *pro-S* hydrogen atom on carbon-1 of 1-propanol with a deuterium atom (D). According to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules, an isotope with a higher mass number has priority over one with a lower mass number (i.e., D has a higher priority than H).\n\nWhat is the absolute configuration (R or S) of the chiral center created at carbon-1 in the resulting molecule?\n\nA. R\n\nB. S\n\nC. The product is achiral.\n\nD. A racemic mixture is formed.", "solution": "The problem asks for the absolute configuration of the chiral center formed when the pro-S hydrogen on C-1 of 1-propanol is replaced by a deuterium atom. This is a multi-step process involving the identification of the pro-S hydrogen and then the assignment of configuration to the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the prochiral center and the attached groups.**\nThe carbon atom in question is C-1 of 1-propanol ($CH_3CH_2CH_2OH$). This carbon is bonded to four groups: a hydroxyl group ($-OH$), an ethyl group ($-CH_2CH_3$), and two hydrogen atoms. Since the replacement of one of these hydrogens with a different group (deuterium) creates a chiral center, the original C-1 is a prochiral center, and the two hydrogens are enantiotopic.\n\n**Step 2: Determine which hydrogen is pro-S.**\nTo distinguish between the two enantiotopic hydrogens ($H_a$ and $H_b$), we use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) system. The pro-S hydrogen is the one which, if hypothetically given a higher priority than the other hydrogen, would lead to an S configuration for the center.\n\nLet's assign priorities to the main groups attached to C-1:\n- Priority 1: $-OH$ (Oxygen, atomic number 8)\n- Priority 2: $-CH_2CH_3$ (Carbon, atomic number 6)\n\nNow, consider the two hydrogens, $H_a$ and $H_b$. Let's temporarily assign $H_a$ a higher priority than $H_b$. The priority list for this hypothetical assignment is:\n- Priority 1: $-OH$\n- Priority 2: $-CH_2CH_3$\n- Priority 3: $H_a$\n- Priority 4: $H_b$\n\nTo assign a configuration, we must visualize the molecule in three dimensions. Let's orient the molecule such that the lowest priority group, $H_b$, is pointing away from the viewer (on a dashed bond). Then we observe the arrangement of the remaining three groups. A convenient orientation is to place the C-1 atom at the center, with the $-OH$ group pointing up, the $-CH_2CH_3$ group pointing to the bottom-left, and $H_a$ pointing to the bottom-right.\n\nWith $H_b$ (priority 4) in the back, we trace the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3:\n- Path: $-OH$ (1) $\\rightarrow$ $-CH_2CH_3$ (2) $\\rightarrow$ $H_a$ (3).\nThis path traces a clockwise (CW) direction.\nA clockwise direction corresponds to the R configuration. Therefore, with our temporary assignment, the center is R. This means that the hydrogen $H_a$ is the **pro-R** hydrogen. Consequently, the other hydrogen, $H_b$, must be the **pro-S** hydrogen.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the product of the enzymatic reaction.**\nThe problem states that the enzyme replaces the pro-S hydrogen with a deuterium atom (D). From Step 2, we identified $H_b$ as the pro-S hydrogen. So, $H_b$ is replaced by D. The other hydrogen, $H_a$ (the pro-R one), remains.\n\nThe resulting molecule has the following four groups attached to C-1:\n- $-OH$\n- $-CH_2CH_3$\n- D (in the position of the original $H_b$)\n- H (the original $H_a$)\n\n**Step 4: Assign the absolute configuration to the product molecule.**\nWe now assign the absolute configuration to this new chiral center using the actual CIP priorities of the final groups. The problem states that D has a higher priority than H.\n- Priority 1: $-OH$\n- Priority 2: $-CH_2CH_3$\n- Priority 3: D\n- Priority 4: H\n\nLet's use the same spatial orientation we established in Step 2. In that orientation, the pro-R hydrogen ($H_a$) was at the bottom-right position, and the pro-S hydrogen ($H_b$) was in the back.\nThe product has the remaining hydrogen (the original $H_a$) at the bottom-right position, and a deuterium atom (D) in the back (the original $H_b$ position).\n\nSo, for the product molecule, the lowest priority group is H (priority 4), and it is located at the bottom-right, not in the back. The group in the back is D (priority 3). To correctly assign the configuration, we must orient the molecule so the lowest priority group (H, priority 4) is in the back.\n\nWe can achieve this by performing a valid manipulation. Let's take the current orientation (D in back, H at bottom-right) and swap the positions of the H and D groups. Swapping any two groups at a chiral center inverts its absolute configuration.\nAfter swapping H and D, our new (hypothetical) molecule has:\n- H (priority 4) in the back.\n- D (priority 3) at the bottom-right.\n- $-OH$ (priority 1) remains up.\n- $-CH_2CH_3$ (priority 2) remains at the bottom-left.\n\nNow, with the lowest priority group (H) in the back, we trace the path 1 $\\rightarrow$ 2 $\\rightarrow$ 3:\n- Path: $-OH$ (1) $\\rightarrow$ $-CH_2CH_3$ (2) $\\rightarrow$ D (3).\nThis path goes from up, to bottom-left, to bottom-right, which is a clockwise (CW) direction.\nTherefore, the configuration of this swapped molecule is R.\n\nSince the swapped molecule has an R configuration, and it was obtained by a single swap from the actual product molecule, the actual product molecule must have the opposite configuration, which is **S**.\n\nThe product is a single enantiomer because the enzymatic reaction is stereospecific, so options C (achiral) and D (racemic) are incorrect.

Thus, the preliminary priorities are: -OH is priority 1, and -H is priority 4. The relative priority of the C1 and C3 paths must be determined by deeper comparison.\n\n**Step 2: Compare the two carbon paths starting at C1 and C3 using CIP Rule 2.**\nWe must look ahead to the next atoms, comparing sets in descending order of atomic number.\n- From C1, the atoms directly attached (excluding the path back to C2) are C8, C9, and H. The list of atomic numbers is [6, 6, 1].\n- From C3, the atoms directly attached (excluding C2) are C4, C10, and H. This list is also [6, 6, 1].\nThis is a tie. We must continue by comparing the paths recursively.\n\n**Refining the comparison by looking one bond further:**\nWe compare the highest priority branches from each side. The adamantane cage is highly symmetric, so we must trace carefully until we find the single point of difference, which is the deuterium atom at C5.\n- Let's trace the paths:\n    - Path A starts C2 → C1. From C1 we can go to C9 or C8. Let's pick C9. From C9, we go to C7.\n    - Path B starts C2 → C3. From C3 we can go to C4 or C10. Let's pick C4. From C4, we go to C5.\n- So we are comparing the environment reached via C2 → C1 → C9 → C7... with the environment reached via C2 → C3 → C4 → C5...\n\n**Finding the first point of difference:**\nLet's analyze the atoms attached to the bridgehead carbons C7 and C5.\n- For C7, the attached atoms (excluding the atom from the path, C9) are C5, C10, and one hydrogen (H). The list of attached atoms is [C, C, H].\n- For C5, the attached atoms (excluding C4) are C6, C7, and the deuterium atom (D). The list of attached atoms is [C, C, D].\n\nBy CIP rules, we compare these lists. The first two entries (C vs. C) tie. The third entry compares H and D. Both have atomic number 1, so we use Rule 4 (isotopes). Deuterium (D, mass number 2) outranks hydrogen (H, mass number 1).\nTherefore, the list [C, C, D] outranks [C, C, H]. This means the path that leads to C5 has higher priority than the path that leads to C7.\nThe path through C5 originates from C3 (C2 → C3 → C4 → C5).\nTherefore, the substituent path beginning with C3 has higher priority than the path beginning with C1.\n\n**The final priority order at C2 is:**\n1. -OH\n2. The path starting at C3\n3. The path starting at C1\n4. -H\n\n**Step 3: Determine $R$/$S$ from the given viewing orientation.**\nWe are viewing the molecule along the C2–H bond with H (priority 4) pointing away. This is the correct orientation for direct application of the $R/S$ rule. The arrangement of the other groups is given as:\n- Priority 1 (-OH) is at the top.\n- Priority 2 (path to C3) is to the right.\n- Priority 3 (path to C1) is to the left.\n\nTracing the path from $1 \\to 2 \\to 3$ goes from top to right to left. This describes a **clockwise** motion.\nWith the lowest-priority group pointing away, a clockwise sequence corresponds to the **$R$** configuration.\n\nTherefore, the absolute configuration at C2 is $R$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2157472"}]}
