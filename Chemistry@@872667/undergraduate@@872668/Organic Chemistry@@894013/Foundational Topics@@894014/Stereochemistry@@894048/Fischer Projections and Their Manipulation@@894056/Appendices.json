A common mistake is to treat them like ordinary drawings, rotating them freely. This exercise explores the consequences of a 90-degree rotation—an operation that is not allowed—and reveals a fundamental principle about how these projections encode stereochemical information, particularly for symmetrical meso compounds. [@problem_id:2170889]", "problem": "Consider meso-tartaric acid, which has the chemical structure 2,3-dihydroxybutanedioic acid. In a standard Fischer projection of this molecule (Structure A), the two carboxylic acid (-COOH) groups are placed on the vertical axis, with one at the top and one at the bottom. The chiral carbons are C2 (top) and C3 (bottom). For C2, the hydroxyl (-OH) group is on the left and the hydrogen (-H) atom is on the right. For C3, the hydrogen (-H) atom is on the left and the hydroxyl (-OH) group is on the right.\n\nNow, imagine this entire Fischer projection (Structure A) is rotated exactly 90 degrees clockwise in the plane of the paper to produce a new representation (Structure B).\n\nWhat is the stereochemical relationship between the molecule represented by Structure B and the original molecule represented by Structure A?\n\nA. They are identical.\n\nB. They are enantiomers.\n\nC. They are diastereomers.\n\nD. They are constitutional isomers.\n\nE. They are conformers.", "solution": "We start from the rules of Fischer projections:\n- In a Fischer projection, a rotation by $180^{\\circ}$ in the plane of the paper represents the same molecule (identical configuration at all stereocenters).\n- A rotation by $90^{\\circ}$ in the plane of the paper is not an allowed operation to depict the same molecule; it inverts the configuration at every stereocenter and therefore produces the enantiomeric representation for a chiral molecule.\n\nApply these rules to Structure A (meso-tartaric acid). Structure A has two stereocenters with opposite configurations (one is R and the other is S in standard assignments), and the molecule possesses an internal mirror plane, making it a meso compound and thus achiral. Therefore, its enantiomer is superimposable on itself.\n\nWhen Structure A is rotated by $90^{\\circ}$ to give Structure B, the operation corresponds to converting to the enantiomeric representation. However, because meso-tartaric acid is achiral (meso), the enantiomer is identical to the original molecule. Hence, Structure B and Structure A represent the same molecule.\n\nTherefore, the stereochemical relationship is that they are identical.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2170889"}, {"introduction": "Beyond manipulating existing diagrams, the true power of Fischer projections lies in their ability to unambiguously communicate the absolute configuration of chiral centers.
