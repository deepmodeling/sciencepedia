The rate of these reactions is heavily influenced by the electronic and steric properties of the groups attached to the carbonyl carbon. Consider three common carbonyl compounds:\n\n- Compound I: Formaldehyde (methanal)\n- Compound II: Acetaldehyde (ethanal)\n- Compound III: Acetone (propan-2-one)\n\nThe electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon atom is a primary determinant of the compound's reactivity towards a nucleophile.

III < II < I\n\nC. II < III < I\n\nD. III < I < II\n\nE. I < III < II\n\nF. II < I < III", "solution": "Electrophilicity at the carbonyl carbon arises from polarization of the $C=O$ bond, where oxygen, being more electronegative, bears $\\delta^{-}$ and the carbon bears $\\delta^{+}$. The magnitude of the positive charge at carbon is increased by electron-withdrawing groups and decreased by electron-donating groups through the inductive effect and hyperconjugation. Alkyl groups exert a +I effect and can stabilize the carbocation-like character at the carbonyl carbon by hyperconjugation, thereby lowering its electrophilicity.\n\nCompare the substituents:\n- Formaldehyde (I) has two hydrogens attached to the carbonyl carbon. Hydrogens do not donate electron density by +I or hyperconjugation, so the carbonyl carbon retains a relatively large $\\delta^{+}$ and is highly electrophilic. Sterically, it is also least hindered.\n- Acetaldehyde (II) has one methyl group and one hydrogen. The single alkyl +I and hyperconjugative donation partially reduce the $\\delta^{+}$ at the carbonyl carbon relative to formaldehyde, lowering electrophilicity compared to I. Steric hindrance is moderate.\n- Acetone (III) has two methyl groups. Two alkyl donors further decrease the $\\delta^{+}$ at the carbonyl carbon the most, giving the lowest electrophilicity among the three. Sterically, it is also the most hindered.\n\nTherefore, by electronic effects (primary for electrophilicity), the electrophilicity decreases as $I > II > III$, which means the order of increasing electrophilicity is $III  II  I$.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2168259"}, {"introduction": "A nucleophile's strength is not absolute; it is profoundly influenced by the solvent in which a reaction takes place. This practice problem explores the intriguing case of halide ions in polar protic solvents, where the expected trend of nucleophilicity is inverted.

Consider the halide ions: fluoride ($F^-$), chloride ($Cl^-$), bromide ($Br^-$), and iodide ($I^-$). When these ions act as nucleophiles in a reaction carried out in a polar protic solvent, such as ethanol, their relative strengths are determined by interactions with the solvent molecules.\n\nArrange these four halide ions in order of increasing nucleophilicity in a polar protic solvent.

A representative interaction is $X^{-} \\cdots H-O-R$, where $X^{-}$ is a halide and $R$ denotes the alkyl group of the alcohol.\n\nPrinciple 2: The strength of solvation increases with anion charge density. Smaller anions have higher charge density and form stronger, more tightly bound solvation shells. Thus, $F^{-}$ is most strongly solvated, followed by $Cl^{-}$, then $Br^{-}$, and $I^{-}$ is least strongly solvated.\n\nPrinciple 3: Stronger solvation lowers effective nucleophilicity because the anion must disrupt its solvation shell to attack an electrophile. Therefore, in polar protic solvents, nucleophilicity increases as solvation weakens, which corresponds to increasing ion size and polarizability down the group.\n\nConclusion: The nucleophilicity order in a polar protic solvent is\n$$F^{-}  Cl^{-}  Br^{-}  I^{-}.$$\nMatching the options given, this corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2168298"}, {"introduction": "Building on our understanding of nucleophiles and electrophiles, this final exercise demonstrates how these principles can be used to control reaction outcomes. You will analyze the alkylation of an unsymmetrical ketone, where two different nucleophilic sites can be generated from the same starting material. By manipulating the reaction temperature, a chemist can favor either the kinetically or thermodynamically preferred product, a concept central to modern synthetic strategy [@problem_id:2168297].", "problem": "An organic chemist is investigating the regioselectivity of the alkylation of an unsymmetrical ketone. The starting material is 2-methylcyclohexanone. The chemist performs a two-step sequence. In the first step, the ketone is treated with one equivalent of Lithium Diisopropylamide (LDA), a strong and sterically hindered base, to form an enolate ion. This deprotonation is carried out under two different temperature regimens. In the second step, an excess of methyl iodide ($CH_3I$) is added to the enolate solution to act as the electrophile.\n\n-   **Condition K**: The deprotonation is performed at a low temperature of -78 °C in tetrahydrofuran (THF), and methyl iodide is added subsequently while maintaining this low temperature.\n-   **Condition T**: The deprotonation is initially performed at -78 °C, but the solution is allowed to warm to room temperature (25 °C) and equilibrate for one hour before the addition of methyl iodide.\n\nYour task is to determine the major organic product formed under Condition K and the major organic product formed under Condition T.

Product under K: 2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone; Product under T: 1-methoxy-6-methylcyclohex-1-ene", "solution": "2-Methylcyclohexanone has two nonequivalent alpha positions adjacent to the carbonyl carbon: C2, which already bears a methyl substituent, and C6, which is unsubstituted. Deprotonation at C2 leads to a more substituted enolate, while deprotonation at C6 leads to a less substituted enolate. Lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) is a strong, sterically hindered, non-nucleophilic base that forms enolates under kinetic control at low temperature and under thermodynamic control when enolate equilibration is allowed.\n\nUnder Condition K, the deprotonation is carried out at low temperature in THF and methyl iodide is added without warming. These conditions favor formation and trapping of the kinetic enolate. The kinetic enolate is formed by deprotonation at the less hindered alpha position (C6), because this proton is more accessible and removal is faster. The resulting less substituted enolate attacks methyl iodide at carbon in an $\\mathrm{S_N2}$ reaction, giving methyl substitution at C6. Therefore, the major product under Condition K is 2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone.\n\nUnder Condition T, the enolate is initially formed at low temperature but the solution is then warmed to room temperature and allowed to equilibrate before addition of methyl iodide. These conditions allow interconversion of enolates so that the more stable, more substituted enolate predominates. For 2-methylcyclohexanone, this thermodynamic enolate arises from deprotonation at C2 (the alpha carbon already bearing the methyl group), which gives the more substituted enolate. Alkylation of this enolate with methyl iodide at carbon furnishes the geminal dimethyl product at C2, namely 2,2-dimethylcyclohexanone.\n\nBecause LDA-generated lithium enolates reacting with methyl iodide undergo predominant C-alkylation rather than O-alkylation under these conditions, enol ether products are not the major products. Matching these outcomes to the options given, the product under Condition K is 2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone and the product under Condition T is 2,2-dimethylcyclohexanone.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2168297"}]}
