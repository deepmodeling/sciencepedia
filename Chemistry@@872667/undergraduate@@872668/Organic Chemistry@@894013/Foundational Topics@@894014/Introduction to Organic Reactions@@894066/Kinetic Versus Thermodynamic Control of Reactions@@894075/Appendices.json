Here, C6 is less hindered than C2, so initial deprotonation and hence initial deuterium incorporation occur at C6. Therefore, at very short reaction times (Experiment A), the major product is monodeuteration at C6, i.e., 6-deuterio-2-methylcyclohexanone (Product II).\n- Thermodynamic control: Over long times (Experiment B), the reversible exchange proceeds until all enolizable $\\alpha$-hydrogens are replaced by deuterium due to repeated enolate formation and deuteronation in excess $\\text{D}_2\\text{O}$.

Kinetic Product: III, Thermodynamic Product: I\n\nE. Kinetic Product: II, Thermodynamic Product: III", "solution": "Step 1: Identify the reactive positions and possible allylic radicals.\nThe substrate is 4-methyl-1-pentene, which can be written as CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)2. The allylic positions relative to the C1=C2 double bond are on C3 (the methylene next to the alkene). There are no other allylic C-H bonds in the starting structure, so the only feasible initial hydrogen abstraction by a bromine radical occurs at C3 to generate an allylic radical.\n\nStep 2: Describe the mechanism and resonance.\nUnder NBS/radical conditions, a bromine radical abstracts an allylic hydrogen to give an allylic radical. For this substrate, abstraction at C3 gives an allylic radical that is delocalized over C3 and C1 by resonance. The two resonance contributors correspond to:\n- a secondary allylic radical centered at C3 (more substituted allylic radical),\n- a primary allylic radical centered at C1 (less substituted allylic radical).\nTrapping of this allylic radical by Br2 (maintained at low, steady concentration by NBS) can occur at either radical-bearing position, yielding two allylic bromides:\n- Capture at C3 (the site with greater radical stabilization and higher spin density) gives 3-bromo-4-methyl-1-pentene (I), retaining the terminal double bond.\n- Capture at C1 gives 1-bromo-4-methyl-2-pentene (II), with the double bond shifted internally.\n\nStep 3: Kinetic control (Condition K: very low temperature, short time).\nUnder kinetic control, product ratios reflect the relative rates of formation, which depend on the radical’s spin density and transition-state energies. The initial hydrogen abstraction unambiguously forms the allylic radical at C3 because that is the only allylic C-H available. In the resulting resonance-stabilized allyl radical, the more substituted secondary allylic center at C3 bears greater stabilization and higher spin density, so bromine addition at C3 is faster. Therefore, the kinetic product is 3-bromo-4-methyl-1-pentene (I).\n\nPrinciples used: selectivity in radical H abstraction for the allylic position; relative stability of allylic radical centers (secondary allylic more stable than primary allylic); rate of trapping correlates with spin density at the radical site (kinetic control).\n\nStep 4: Thermodynamic control (Condition T: high temperature, extended time).\nAt higher temperature and longer reaction time, reversible radical processes allow equilibration among allylic bromides via homolysis/re-abstraction and readdition, effectively isomerizing the double bond. Under thermodynamic control, the more stable alkene is favored. Between I (terminal alkene) and II (internal alkene), the internal double bond in II is more substituted and thus more thermodynamically stable. Therefore, the thermodynamic product is 1-bromo-4-methyl-2-pentene (II).\n\nPrinciples used: thermodynamic control favors the more stable alkene (more substituted double bond); NBS conditions allow allylic isomerization under prolonged, high-temperature radical conditions.\n\nStep 5: Exclusion of other listed products.\n- III (4-bromo-4-methyl-1-pentene) would require non-allylic radical substitution and is not formed under selective allylic bromination conditions.\n- IV (1,2-dibromo-4-methylpentane) results from electrophilic addition of Br2 across the double bond; NBS maintains low Br2 concentration specifically to suppress addition in favor of allylic substitution, so IV is not the major product under either set of radical conditions.\n\nConclusion: Kinetic major product is I, thermodynamic major product is II, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2181601"}, {"introduction": "A deep understanding of a scientific concept involves not only applying it to predict outcomes but also knowing how to experimentally verify it.

This reaction is known to produce two major products: 3-bromo-1-butene, which is the kinetic product (**K**), and 1-bromo-2-butene, which is the thermodynamic product (**T**). To definitively prove that the formation of **T** is under thermodynamic control, the chemist designs an experiment involving an isotopically labeled sample.\n\nFirst, the chemist synthesizes a pure sample of the kinetic product, **K**, in which one of the atoms has been replaced with a heavy isotope. This labeled version is denoted as **K***.\n\nNext, the chemist takes this pure sample of **K*** and dissolves it in a solvent with an excess of regular, unlabeled HBr. The solution is then heated to a temperature and for a duration known to be sufficient for the reaction mixture to reach thermodynamic equilibrium. After this period, the organic products in the mixture are isolated and analyzed.\n\nAssuming the reaction is indeed under thermodynamic control, which of the following experimental outcomes is expected upon analysis of the final product mixture?\n\nA. The isotopic label will be found distributed among both the remaining kinetic product molecules (**K**) and the newly formed thermodynamic product molecules (**T**).\n\nB. The isotopic label will remain exclusively within the kinetic product molecules (**K**), and no formation of the thermodynamic product (**T**) will be observed.\n\nC. The thermodynamic product (**T**) will be formed, but it will be completely unlabeled. The isotopic label will only be present in the unreacted kinetic product (**K**).\n\nD. All of the initial isotopically labeled kinetic product (**K***) will be converted into isotopically labeled thermodynamic product (**T**), with no kinetic product remaining.\n\nE. The isotopic label will be completely removed from all organic products and will be found in other species within the reaction mixture, such as isotopically labeled water or hydrogen bromide.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the defining principle of thermodynamic control: when a reaction is reversible and allowed to reach equilibrium, the final product distribution depends only on the relative standard Gibbs free energies of the products, not on the kinetic barriers. Quantitatively, for two interconverting products, the equilibrium constant satisfies\n$$\nK_{\\text{eq}}=\\frac{[T]}{[K]}=\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\circ}}{RT}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta G^{\\circ}=G^{\\circ}_{T}-G^{\\circ}_{K}$. Under thermodynamic control at sufficiently high temperature and in the presence of an acid catalyst (here, excess HBr), the allylic bromides 3-bromo-1-butene (K) and 1-bromo-2-butene (T) interconvert via reversible steps that proceed through a common allylic intermediate (e.g., an allylic carbocation in the presence of HBr, or via reversible elimination to 1,3-butadiene followed by readdition of HBr). By microscopic reversibility, both K and T can form from and revert to this common intermediate, ensuring equilibration.\n\nNow consider the isotopic label. A pure sample of labeled kinetic product $K^{*}$ is dissolved in excess unlabeled HBr and heated long enough to reach equilibrium. Because the interconversion between K and T proceeds reversibly through a common intermediate, molecules originating as $K^{*}$ will sample both product wells multiple times before the system reaches equilibrium. Therefore, any atom that remains within the organic framework during interconversion will appear in both product pools at equilibrium. In other words, the isotopic label that starts in $K^{*}$ will be found in some fraction of the remaining K molecules and in some fraction of the T molecules produced at equilibrium.\n\nThis expectation is the diagnostic signature of thermodynamic control: starting from $K^{*}$ and observing labeled T demonstrates that T is accessed by reversible equilibration, not by an independent, one-way pathway that preserves the label exclusively in K.\n\nWe now assess each option:\n- Option A: The isotopic label will be found distributed among both K and T. This is consistent with reversible interconversion via a common intermediate under thermodynamic control; it is the expected outcome.\n- Option B: The label remains exclusively in K and no T forms. This contradicts the premise of thermodynamic control at equilibrium, where T must form if it is thermodynamically favored.\n- Option C: T forms but is completely unlabeled, with label only in unreacted K. If equilibration proceeds through a common intermediate without complete loss of label to non-organic reservoirs, labeled T must appear. Thus this is not the general thermodynamic-control outcome.\n- Option D: All $K^{*}$ converts to labeled T with no K remaining. At equilibrium, unless $G^{\\circ}_{T}\\ll G^{\\circ}_{K}$ to the extent that $[K]\\to 0$, some K typically remains; complete disappearance of K is not the general expectation.\n- Option E: The label is completely removed from all organic products and found in other species (e.g., labeled HBr or water). While exchange of a labeled bromine with excess HBr can dilute label in the organic fraction, complete removal from all organic products is not implied by thermodynamic control and is not required to demonstrate it. The definitive signature sought here is labeled T appearing from $K^{*}$ upon equilibration.\n\nTherefore, the expected outcome under thermodynamic control is that the isotopic label is found in both K and T at equilibrium.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2181653"}]}
