This exercise presents a classic comparison between a saturated and an aromatic heterocycle to illustrate this principle. Determining which lone pair is more available for protonation will reinforce your understanding of how aromatic stability can sequester electrons, rendering them non-basic [@problem_id:2203330].", "problem": "Consider the two five-membered heterocyclic compounds: furan ($\\text{C}_4\\text{H}_4\\text{O}$) and tetrahydrofuran (THF, $\\text{C}_4\\text{H}_8\\text{O}$). Both molecules feature an oxygen atom with two lone pairs of electrons, which can allow them to act as Brønsted-Lowry bases by accepting a proton.\n\nBased on the principles of chemical structure and bonding, which compound is the more potent base, and what is the primary structural reason for this difference in basicity?\n\nA. Furan is more basic because its oxygen atom is $sp^2$-hybridized, which places the lone pair electrons in higher energy orbitals, making them more available for donation.\nB. THF is more basic because the oxygen atom's lone pairs are localized in $sp^3$-hybridized orbitals and are fully available for protonation. In contrast, one of the lone pairs on the oxygen in furan is delocalized as part of the ring's aromatic system, making it significantly less available.\nC. Furan is more basic because the planarity of the ring allows for better stabilization of the positive charge that forms on the oxygen atom after it is protonated.\nD. THF is more basic primarily due to the electron-donating inductive effect of the saturated alkyl portions of the ring, which increases the electron density on the oxygen atom more than in furan.\nE. The basicity of furan and THF is nearly identical because the primary determinant of basicity is the identity of the heteroatom (oxygen), which is the same in both molecules.", "solution": "We compare basicity using Brønsted-Lowry principles: a stronger base donates a lone pair more readily to $\\text{H}^+$, which correlates with the lone pair’s availability (lack of delocalization) and orbital energy (hybridization).\n\n1) In tetrahydrofuran (THF), the oxygen is $sp^3$-hybridized. Both lone pairs reside in localized $sp^3$ orbitals. Localized lone pairs are fully available for protonation. Moreover, $sp^3$ orbitals have less $s$-character than $sp^2$, so their lone pairs are higher in energy and thus more basic.\n\n2) In furan, the oxygen is $sp^2$-hybridized. By Hückel’s rule, aromaticity requires $4n+2$ $\\pi$ electrons with $n=1$, i.e., $6$ $\\pi$ electrons. Furan’s ring has $4$ $\\pi$ electrons from the two C=C bonds and obtains the remaining $2$ from one of oxygen’s lone pairs in a $p$ orbital perpendicular to the ring. Therefore:\n- One lone pair is delocalized as part of the aromatic $\\pi$ system, making it unavailable for protonation without disrupting aromatic stabilization.\n- The remaining lone pair resides in an $sp^2$ orbital, which has greater $s$-character than $sp^3$ and hence lower energy, making it less basic than an $sp^3$ lone pair.\n\n3) Conclusion: THF is more basic because its oxygen lone pairs are localized in $sp^3$ orbitals and are fully available, whereas in furan one lone pair is tied up in aromatic delocalization and the other is in a lower-energy $sp^2$ orbital. The primary structural reason is the delocalization of one lone pair into the aromatic ring in furan, which significantly reduces basicity. This corresponds to option B.
