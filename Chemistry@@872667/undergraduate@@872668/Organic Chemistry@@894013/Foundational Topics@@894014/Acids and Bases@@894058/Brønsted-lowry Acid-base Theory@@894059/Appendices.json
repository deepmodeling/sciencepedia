This is particularly crucial in organic chemistry, where functional groups exist in complex electronic environments. The following exercise [@problem_id:2157139] presents a classic comparison between pyridine and pyrrole, challenging you to determine which is more basic by considering how hybridization and aromaticity affect the availability of the nitrogen's lone pair for protonation.", "problem": "In the study of organic chemistry, the structure of a molecule dictates its reactivity. Consider two aromatic heterocyclic compounds: pyridine and pyrrole.\n\nPyridine is a six-membered aromatic ring composed of five carbon atoms and one nitrogen atom, with a conjugated system of three double bonds. Its structure is analogous to benzene, with one CH group replaced by a nitrogen atom.\n\nPyrrole is a five-membered aromatic ring composed of four carbon atoms and one nitrogen atom. The nitrogen atom is bonded to two carbon atoms and one hydrogen atom, and the ring contains two double bonds. The aromaticity of pyrrole is achieved by the participation of the nitrogen's lone pair of electrons in the conjugated $\\pi$ system.\n\nBased on the principles of Brønsted-Lowry acid-base theory, determine which of the following statements most accurately compares the basicity of the nitrogen atom in pyridine versus pyrrole.\n\nA. Pyridine is more basic. The nitrogen lone pair in pyridine occupies an $sp^2$ hybrid orbital, is not part of the aromatic $\\pi$ system, and is therefore available for protonation.\n\nB. Pyrrole is more basic. The nitrogen lone pair in pyrrole is delocalized over the aromatic ring, which increases the electron density on the nitrogen and makes it more available for protonation.\n\nC. Pyridine is more basic. The nitrogen atom in pyridine is $sp^3$ hybridized, which places the lone pair in an orbital with less s-character, making it more available for donation than the $sp^2$ hybridized nitrogen in pyrrole.\n\nD. Pyrrole is more basic. The five-membered ring of pyrrole is more strained than the six-membered ring of pyridine, which increases the reactivity of the nitrogen lone pair.\n\nE. Both are equally basic. Since both molecules are aromatic and contain a nitrogen atom with a lone pair, their ability to accept a proton is identical.", "solution": "By Brønsted-Lowry theory, a base is a proton acceptor. Basicity in these nitrogen-containing aromatics is governed by the availability of the nitrogen lone pair for bonding to a proton and by the stability of the resulting conjugate acid, which in aromatic systems is strongly influenced by whether aromaticity is preserved.\n\nIn pyridine, the ring is aromatic with $6$ $\\pi$ electrons satisfying Hückel’s $4n+2$ rule with $n=1$. The nitrogen is $sp^{2}$ hybridized; its lone pair resides in an $sp^{2}$ orbital oriented in the plane of the ring and is not part of the ring’s $\\pi$ system, which uses the nitrogen’s perpendicular $p$ orbital. Therefore, this lone pair is available to accept a proton. Protonation at nitrogen gives the pyridinium ion while preserving the $6$-electron $\\pi$ aromatic system, which stabilizes the conjugate acid and supports basicity.\n\nIn pyrrole, the ring’s aromaticity also requires $6$ $\\pi$ electrons satisfying $4n+2$ with $n=1$. Here, the nitrogen is $sp^{2}$ hybridized, but its lone pair occupies the perpendicular $p$ orbital and contributes $2$ electrons to the $\\pi$ system. Thus the lone pair is delocalized over the ring and essential for aromaticity. Protonation at nitrogen would remove this lone pair from the $\\pi$ system, disrupting aromaticity and yielding a much less stabilized conjugate acid. Consequently, the nitrogen lone pair in pyrrole is not readily available for protonation, and pyrrole is much less basic than pyridine.\n\nEvaluating the statements:\n- A correctly states that pyridine is more basic because its nitrogen lone pair is in an $sp^{2}$ hybrid orbital not involved in the $\\pi$ system and is available for protonation.\n- B is incorrect because delocalization of the pyrrole lone pair into the $\\pi$ system decreases its availability and protonation would break aromaticity.\n- C is incorrect because the nitrogen in pyridine is $sp^{2}$, not $sp^{3}$.\n- D is incorrect because ring strain is not the governing factor here; aromaticity and lone-pair participation dominate.\n- E is incorrect because their basicities are not identical for the reasons above.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate comparison is given in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2157139"}, {"introduction": "Applying acid-base principles is central to designing and controlling organic reactions.

Lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. In an aprotic solvent such as THF and at low temperature, LDA performs rapid, irreversible deprotonation of the most accessible alpha site, producing the enolate under kinetic control.\n\n2) State the governing acid-base principle. The reaction is an acid-base equilibrium in which LDA deprotonates an alpha hydrogen of the ketone to give the conjugate base (the enolate) and diisopropylamine. Because LDA is much stronger as a base than the conjugate base of the ketone is as a base (equivalently, the conjugate acid of LDA has a much larger $pK_{a}$ than the ketone), the equilibrium lies far to the right for deprotonation under these conditions.\n\n3) Kinetic versus thermodynamic enolate formation. Two enolates are possible:\n- Deprotonation at C1 (the less hindered methyl side) gives the kinetic enolate, in which the carbon-carbon double bond is between C1 and C2.\n- Deprotonation at C3 (the more substituted side) gives the thermodynamic enolate, in which the carbon-carbon double bond is between C2 and C3.\nUnder low-temperature conditions with bulky, non-nucleophilic LDA in THF, the kinetic enolate is favored because the least hindered alpha hydrogen is abstracted most rapidly.\n\n4) Resonance description of the enolate. The enolate is a resonance-stabilized anion. The two principal resonance contributors are:\n- The oxyanion form: a carbon-carbon double bond between C1 and C2 with a negative charge on oxygen (C2–O single bond).\n- The carbanion form: a carbon-oxygen double bond at C2 with the negative charge on the alpha carbon.\nBecause oxygen is more electronegative than carbon, the resonance contributor bearing the negative charge on oxygen is the principal contributor.\n\n5) Exclusion of incorrect alternatives.\n- B describes the thermodynamic enolate (C2=C3), which is not favored under kinetic, low-temperature LDA conditions.\n- C invokes deprotonation at C5, which is not alpha to the carbonyl and therefore is not deprotonated to form an enolate.\n- D suggests nucleophilic addition of LDA to the carbonyl carbon, which does not occur because LDA is designed to be non-nucleophilic; the reaction proceeds via deprotonation.\n- E is incorrect because strong base LDA does deprotonate 2-pentanone under these conditions to form the enolate.\n\n6) Conclusion.
