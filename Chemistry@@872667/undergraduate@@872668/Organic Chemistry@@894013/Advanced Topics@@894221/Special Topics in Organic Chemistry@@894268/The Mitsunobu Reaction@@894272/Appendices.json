The target molecule is (S)-sec-butyl phthalimide. The chosen synthetic method is the Mitsunobu reaction, which utilizes phthalimide as the nucleophile, triphenylphosphine ($PPh_3$), and diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD). To ensure the synthesis yields the product with the correct absolute configuration, the chemist must select the appropriate starting alcohol.\n\nWhich one of the following compounds is the correct starting alcohol required for this synthesis?\n\nA. (R)-butan-2-ol\n\nB. (S)-butan-2-ol\n\nC. Racemic butan-2-ol\n\nD.

Therefore, the stereochemistry at the reacting carbon undergoes a single Walden inversion.\n\nFor butan-2-ol, the stereocenter is at C2 with substituents $\\{ \\mathrm{OH}, \\mathrm{C_{2}H_{5}}, \\mathrm{CH_{3}}, \\mathrm{H} \\}$. By Cahn–Ingold–Prelog rules, the priority order in the starting alcohol is $\\mathrm{OH} \\,(1) > \\mathrm{C_{2}H_{5}} \\,(2) > \\mathrm{CH_{3}} \\,(3) > \\mathrm{H} \\,(4)$.\n\nIn the product, the substituent introduced is nitrogen of the phthalimide group.

The substrate is 3-hydroxy-4,4-dimethyl-1-phenylpentan-1-one, which has the structure $Ph-CO-CH_2-CH(OH)-C(CH_3)_2-CH_3$. The alcohol is secondary at C3 and is flanked on one side (C4) by a quaternary carbon, creating severe steric hindrance, and on the other side (C2) by a methylene group whose protons are acidic due to being both $\\beta$ to the hydroxyl group and $\\alpha$ to the carbonyl group.\n\nUnder Mitsunobu conditions with $PPh_3$ and DEAD in the presence of benzoic acid, the general mechanistic sequence is:\n1) $PPh_3$ adds to DEAD forming a betaine, which then activates the alcohol to the corresponding oxyphosphonium species, $R-CH(O^{+}-PPh_3)$. Concurrently, benzoic acid is deprotonated to give the benzoate anion.\n2) From this point, two pathways can compete:\n   - $S_N2$ at the hindered secondary center by benzoate to give inversion and the ester $R-CH(OBz)$.\n   - $E2$ elimination, in which a base (benzoate or the basic betaine) removes a $\\beta$-hydrogen antiperiplanar to the leaving group, expelling the oxyphosphonium and forming an alkene.\n\nAnalysis of the $S_N2$ pathway: The electrophilic center is C3, a secondary carbon rendered extremely hindered by the adjacent quaternary center at C4, which strongly raises the barrier to backside attack required for $S_N2$. Thus, the $S_N2$ pathway to give 3-(benzoyloxy)-4,4-dimethyl-1-phenylpentan-1-one is highly disfavored.\n\nAnalysis of the $E2$ pathway: The leaving group is an excellent leaving group (oxyphosphonium), and the only accessible $\\beta$-hydrogens are located at C2 (adjacent to the carbonyl), because C4 is quaternary and lacks hydrogens. The C2 hydrogens are relatively acidic due to $\\alpha$-carbonyl stabilization of the developing carbanion character in the $E2$ transition state. Therefore, deprotonation at C2 with simultaneous loss of the oxyphosphonium from C3 gives a double bond between C2 and C3. This produces an $\\alpha,\\beta$-unsaturated ketone, which is thermodynamically stabilized by conjugation with the carbonyl. Rotation about the C2–C3 bond in the starting material allows an antiperiplanar arrangement for $E2$, and the more stable $E$ alkene is formed preferentially due to minimized steric interactions between the large substituents on the resulting double bond.\n\nRegiochemical and stereochemical outcome: Elimination can occur only toward C2 (no hydrogens at C4), giving the conjugated enone $Ph-CO-CH=CH-C(CH_3)_2-CH_3$. The favored geometry is $E$, written as (E)-4,4-dimethyl-1-phenylpent-2-en-1-one.\n\nMatching to the options:\n- A corresponds to the disfavored $S_N2$ substitution product.\n- B corresponds to the favored $E2$ elimination product, the conjugated enone.\n- C, D, and E do not follow from the Mitsunobu manifold for this substrate.\n\nTherefore, the major product is option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2211909"}, {"introduction": "Moving from theoretical mechanism to practical execution, a key consideration in synthesis is the ease of product purification.
