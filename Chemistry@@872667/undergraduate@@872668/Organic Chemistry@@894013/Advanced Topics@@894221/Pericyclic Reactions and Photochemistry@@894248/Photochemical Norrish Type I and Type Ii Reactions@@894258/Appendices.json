This practice problem models the photodegradation of a simple ketone, guiding you through the characteristic steps of $\\gamma$-hydrogen abstraction, fragmentation, and tautomerization to identify the final stable products. This mechanism is crucial for predicting the photostability and degradation pathways of polymers and other long-chain organic molecules [@problem_id:2189701].", "problem": "In the field of polymer science, understanding the photodegradation of materials is crucial. Ketone functionalities within polymer chains can act as photosensitizers, initiating degradation pathways through well-known photochemical reactions. A model system for studying this process involves the irradiation of simple acyclic ketones with ultraviolet (UV) light.\n\nConsider the specific case of 2-pentanone being irradiated with UV light, causing it to undergo a Norrish Type II reaction. The primary photochemical step is an intramolecular hydrogen abstraction, leading to a 1,4-biradical intermediate. This biradical subsequently undergoes carbon-carbon bond cleavage (fragmentation) to produce an alkene and an enol intermediate. The enol is thermodynamically unstable and rapidly rearranges to form a stable ketone.\n\nWhat is the final, stable ketone product generated from this photodegradation pathway? Provide your answer as the standard International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name for this molecule.", "solution": "2-Pentanone has the structure CH3-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3, with the carbonyl carbon designated as position 2. In a Norrish Type II process, the photoexcited ketone (typically the $n \\to \\pi^*$ triplet) abstracts a hydrogen that is gamma to the carbonyl. For 2-pentanone, the gamma position relative to the carbonyl is the terminal methyl at C5, so an intramolecular gamma-hydrogen abstraction occurs to give a 1,4-biradical in which the oxygen bears an O–H bond and radical centers reside at the carbonyl carbon and the gamma carbon.\n\nFrom this 1,4-biradical, the characteristic Norrish Type II fragmentation proceeds by cleavage of the carbon-carbon bond between the alpha and beta carbons on the side bearing the abstracted gamma hydrogen (here, the C3–C4 bond). This scission is concerted with formation of an alkene between the beta and gamma carbons (C4 and C5), yielding ethene as the alkene fragment, and with reformation of the carbonyl via the enol of the remaining fragment derived from the carbonyl side. The enol formed corresponds to the enol of propanone and rapidly tautomerizes to the thermodynamically favored ketone.\n\nTherefore, the final, stable ketone product of the Norrish Type II photofragmentation of 2-pentanone is propanone (common name: acetone).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{propanone}$$", "id": "2189701"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the two primary Norrish pathways, we now investigate how molecular architecture dictates reactivity. This problem uses the rigid, cage-like molecule 2-adamantanone to test your understanding of the strict conformational requirements for the Norrish Type II reaction.

Upon absorption of ultraviolet light, a ketone is promoted to an excited state which can then undergo several characteristic reactions. Two of the most common pathways are the Norrish Type I and Norrish Type II reactions. A Norrish Type I reaction involves the homolytic cleavage of one of the alpha-carbon to carbonyl-carbon bonds, forming a diradical intermediate. A Norrish Type II reaction involves the intramolecular abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the gamma-position by the excited carbonyl oxygen, proceeding through a six-membered cyclic transition state to form a 1,4-diradical.\n\nConsider the molecule 2-adamantanone, a ketone incorporated into the rigid, cage-like, bridged polycyclic framework of adamantane. Based on the mechanistic requirements for each pathway, predict the photochemical reactivity of 2-adamantanone upon irradiation with ultraviolet light.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expected outcome?\n\nA.

It undergoes both Norrish Type I and Norrish Type II reactions.\n\nD. It undergoes neither a Norrish Type I nor a Norrish Type II reaction because its rigid structure renders it photochemically unreactive.\n\nE. It rearranges directly to an unsaturated epoxide without forming a diradical intermediate.", "solution": "A Norrish Type I reaction requires that the excited ketone, typically in the $n, \\pi^*$ state ($S_1$ or after intersystem crossing $T_1$), undergo homolytic cleavage of one of the $\\alpha$ carbon–carbon bonds adjacent to the carbonyl, generating an acyl radical and an alkyl radical. This process primarily depends on the bond dissociation energy of the $\\alpha$ C–C bond and does not require large-amplitude conformational motion or a specific cyclic transition state.\n\nA Norrish Type II reaction requires the presence of an abstractable $\\gamma$ hydrogen and the ability of the excited carbonyl to reach that hydrogen through a six-membered, 1,5-intramolecular hydrogen abstraction transition state to generate a 1,4-diradical. This pathway demands both appropriate spatial proximity and conformational flexibility to achieve the requisite geometry.\n\nIn 2-adamantanone, the carbonyl is embedded in a rigid, bridged adamantane framework. This rigidity prevents the molecule from adopting the six-membered transition state geometry needed for $\\gamma$-hydrogen abstraction. Moreover, due to the cage topology, suitable $\\gamma$ hydrogens are not geometrically accessible to the excited carbonyl oxygen. Therefore, a Norrish Type II reaction is effectively precluded.\n\nBy contrast, Norrish Type I $\\alpha$-cleavage is feasible in such rigid systems because it only requires homolysis of an $\\alpha$ C–C bond from the excited state; in a polycyclic ketone like 2-adamantanone, this cleavage leads to ring-opening diradicals and subsequent fragmentation or recombination pathways. Thus, Norrish Type I is allowed whereas Norrish Type II is disallowed.\n\nTherefore, 2-adamantanone undergoes a Norrish Type I reaction but not a Norrish Type II reaction upon ultraviolet irradiation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2189728"}]}
