The goal is to recognize the essential starting material, an allyl vinyl ether, and correctly predict how the atoms reorganize upon heating to form a $\\gamma,\\delta$-unsaturated carbonyl compound. This practice is key to developing the pattern-recognition skills needed to identify pericyclic reactions in more complex settings [@problem_id:2199286].", "problem": "An allyl vinyl ether is a molecule containing the structural motif $R\\text{-O-CH=CH}_2$, where the R group is an allyl group (containing a C=C-C- unit attached to the oxygen). Upon heating, these ethers undergo a characteristic pericyclic reaction known as the Claisen rearrangement, a type of [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement, to form a γ,δ-unsaturated carbonyl compound.\n\nConsider the thermal rearrangement of an unknown allyl vinyl ether that yields 4-pentenal as the exclusive product. From the list of compounds below, identify the correct structure of the starting allyl vinyl ether.\n\nA. (prop-2-en-1-yloxy)ethene\nB. 1-(Ethenyloxy)prop-1-ene\nC. (Cyclopropyloxy)ethene\nD. Pent-4-en-2-one", "solution": "The Claisen rearrangement of an allyl vinyl ether is a concerted thermal [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement proceeding through a six-membered, suprafacial transition state. The key bond changes involve the breaking of the sigma bond between atoms 3 and 4 of the rearranging framework (the C-O sigma bond) and the formation of a new sigma bond between atoms 1 and 6 (a C-C sigma bond). The pi bonds reorganize simultaneously, and the initial enol product tautomerizes to the more stable carbonyl compound. For the simplest allyl vinyl ether, $\\text{CH}_2=\\text{CH-CH}_2\\text{-O-CH=CH}_2$, the product is $\\text{O=CH-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-CH=CH}_2$, which is 4-pentenal (pent-4-enal).\n\nNow evaluate the options by structure:\n- Option A, (prop-2-en-1-yloxy)ethene, corresponds to $\\text{CH}_2=\\text{CH-CH}_2\\text{-O-CH=CH}_2$, an allyl vinyl ether exactly of the required form. Its Claisen rearrangement gives 4-pentenal, matching the stated product.\n- Option B, 1-(ethenyloxy)prop-1-ene, corresponds to $\\text{CH}_2=\\text{CH-O-CH=CH-CH}_3$. This is not an allyl vinyl ether, as the oxygen is attached to a vinyl group, not an allyl group. It would not yield 4-pentenal.\n- Option C, (cyclopropyloxy)ethene, is $\\text{cyclopropyl-O-CH=CH}_2$; the R group is cyclopropyl rather than allyl, so it is not an allyl vinyl ether and will not give 4-pentenal via the standard Claisen pathway.\n- Option D, pent-4-en-2-one, is already a ketone and not an allyl vinyl ether; it cannot be the starting material.\n\nTherefore, only option A is the correct allyl vinyl ether that rearranges thermally to 4-pentenal.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2199286"}, {"introduction": "Now that we understand the basic connectivity changes, we can explore the elegant stereochemical control inherent in many sigmatropic rearrangements. This problem examines the Cope rearrangement, the all-carbon cousin of the Claisen, and challenges you to predict the product's stereochemistry based on a preferred chair-like transition state. Understanding this principle is crucial for designing and predicting the outcomes of stereospecific syntheses [@problem_id:2199318].", "problem": "An enantiomerically pure sample of (3R,4R)-3,4-dimethyl-1,5-hexadiene is subjected to thermal conditions, causing it to undergo a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement to form a constitutional isomer, octa-2,6-diene. The reaction is known to proceed overwhelmingly through a chair-like six-membered transition state, with the bulky methyl substituents preferentially occupying equatorial-like positions to minimize steric strain.\n\nGiven this information, which of the following best describes the major product formed?\n\nA.

The substrate is 3,4-dimethyl-1,5-hexadiene, with stereocenters at C3 and C4 assigned as (3R,4R). \n\nPrinciple 1 (Woodward–Hoffmann rules): A thermal [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of a 1,5-diene proceeds by a concerted, suprafacial–suprafacial pathway on both allyl fragments. This preserves the relative facial orientations of substituents throughout the pericyclic shift.\n\nPrinciple 2 (Transition-state geometry): For substituted 1,5-dienes, the preferred transition state is a chair-like six-membered array. Bulky substituents at C3 and C4 minimize steric strain by adopting equatorial-like positions (diequatorial) in this chair transition state. On adjacent positions of a chair, two equatorial substituents have a trans relationship. Therefore, the (3R,4R) enantiomer can engage the lowest-energy chair TS in which both methyl groups are equatorial and thus trans-related in the TS.\n\nMapping of bonds in the [3,3]-shift: The central sigma bond C3–C4 breaks, and new pi bonds form between C2–C3 and C4–C5. Concomitantly, connectivity rearranges so that the longest chain incorporates the original methyl groups, giving octa-2,6-diene (with new double bonds at positions 2 and 6 in the 8-carbon numbering).\n\nStereochemical consequence: Because the rearrangement is suprafacial on both allyl fragments and proceeds through a diequatorial (chair) TS, the substituents that become vicinal to each new double bond approach from opposite faces. For each newly formed alkene (at C2=C3 and at C6=C7 in the octane numbering), the higher-priority groups on the two alkene carbons end up anti to each other. This corresponds to trans geometry across each double bond, i.e., the E configuration at both C2 and C6.\n\nBecause the product octa-2,6-diene is achiral (defined only by alkene geometries), an enantiomerically pure (3R,4R) starting material furnishes a single geometrical isomer, not a racemate.\n\nTherefore, the major product is (2E,6E)-octa-2,6-diene.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2199318"}, {"introduction": "We've seen that the chair-like transition state offers remarkable stereochemical control, but just how important is it energetically?
