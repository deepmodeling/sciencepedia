This first exercise presents the classic reaction between cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride, which serves as the textbook case for demonstrating the Alder endo rule. Understanding why one stereoisomer is kinetically favored over another is a fundamental skill, and this practice will solidify your grasp of the principles governing the reaction's stereoselectivity [@problem_id:2201687].", "problem": "A chemist performs a thermal cycloaddition reaction by mixing freshly prepared cyclopentadiene with maleic anhydride. The reaction is conducted at a moderate temperature and is stopped after a short time to ensure that the product distribution is governed by kinetic control rather than thermodynamic control. Which of the following named compounds represents the major organic product formed under these conditions?\n\nA. *exo*-Bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride\nB. *endo*-Bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride\nC. *endo*-Bicyclo[2.2.2]oct-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride\nD. Methyl cyclohexa-1,4-diene-1-carboxylate\nE. 1,2,3,4-Tetrahydronaphthalene", "solution": "The reaction between cyclopentadiene (a conjugated diene) and maleic anhydride (an electron-poor dienophile) is a thermal Diels–Alder cycloaddition, formally a concerted, pericyclic, suprafacial-on-suprafacial, symmetry-allowed [4+2] cycloaddition under the Woodward–Hoffmann rules. In a normal electron-demand Diels–Alder reaction, the principal frontier molecular orbital interaction is between the *HOMO* of the diene and the *LUMO* of the dienophile; the anhydride group on maleic anhydride lowers its *LUMO*, facilitating this interaction.\n\nMaleic anhydride is cis-disubstituted and symmetric, so the only stereochemical issue is endo versus exo approach. According to Alder’s endo rule, when the dienophile bears electron-withdrawing substituents with low-lying $\\pi^{\\ast}$ orbitals, secondary orbital interactions between these $\\pi^{\\ast}$ orbitals and the diene’s developing $\\pi$ system in the endo transition state stabilize that transition state relative to the exo transition state. Under kinetic control (moderate temperature and short reaction time), the major product corresponds to the pathway with the lower activation free energy.

Under kinetic conditions, the substituents adopt the endo orientation relative to the norbornene bridge. Therefore, the major product is endo-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride.\n\nThis excludes the exo isomer (option A) because it is typically the thermodynamic product obtained under higher temperature or longer reaction time. It also excludes the bicyclo[2.2.2] system (option C), which is not formed from cyclopentadiene and a simple two-atom dienophile, and the unrelated structures in options D and E.\n\nThus, the correct choice is the endo-norbornene anhydride adduct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2201687"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the prediction of the major product, this next practice challenges you to analyze its inherent stereochemical properties. While the Diels-Alder reaction creates new stereocenters, the presence of these centers does not automatically render the molecule chiral. This problem requires you to inspect the structure of the endo adduct for internal planes of symmetry, helping you distinguish between chiral molecules and achiral meso compounds—a crucial concept in stereochemistry [@problem_id:2201718].", "problem": "In an organic chemistry laboratory, a student performs a Diels-Alder reaction by mixing freshly distilled cyclopentadiene with maleic anhydride. The reaction proceeds readily to yield a single major product, which is isolated as a white crystalline solid. Spectroscopic analysis confirms that the isolated product is the *endo* adduct, as predicted by the Alder endo rule for kinetically controlled [4+2] cycloaddition reactions.\n\nBased on the structure of this major *endo* product, which of the following statements correctly describes its stereochemical properties?\n\nA. The product is chiral and is formed as a single enantiomer.\nB. The product is chiral and is formed as a racemic mixture.\nC. The product is achiral because it is a meso compound.\nD. The product is achiral, but it is not a meso compound.\nE. The product exists as a pair of rapidly interconverting diastereomers.", "solution": "The Diels-Alder reaction between cyclopentadiene (a symmetric diene) and maleic anhydride (a symmetric dienophile) proceeds by a concerted, suprafacial on both components, [4+2] cycloaddition. Under kinetic control, the Alder endo rule predicts endo approach of the electron-withdrawing anhydride, giving the endo adduct on the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework.\n\nIn this transformation, two new stereocenters are formed at the adjacent carbons derived from the dienophile alkene (the 2 and 3 positions of the norbornene skeleton). Because the cycloaddition is concerted and suprafacial, the two substituents derived from the maleic anhydride are placed cis to each other and oriented endo (toward the bridge).\n\nMaleic anhydride introduces identical substituents at C-2 and C-3, since the two carboxyl groups are interconnected as an anhydride and are symmetry-equivalent. The resulting endo product possesses an internal mirror plane that bisects the bicyclic framework and the anhydride substituents, interconverting the two stereocenters. Consequently, the configurations at the two stereocenters are opposite (for example, $2R,3S$), and the molecule is superposable on its mirror image due to this plane of symmetry.\n\nTherefore, although the product contains two stereocenters, it is achiral because it is a meso compound. It is not formed as a single enantiomer or as a racemic mixture, and there is no pair of rapidly interconverting diastereomers in this case; rather, a single meso diastereomer is obtained as the major endo product.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2201718"}, {"introduction": "Not all Diels-Alder reactions result in meso compounds. This final exercise explores a different, yet equally important, stereochemical outcome: the creation of chirality from achiral starting materials. By reacting 1,3-butadiene with methyl acrylate, you will see how a chiral product can be formed and why it results in a racemic mixture. This practice provides a critical contrast to the previous example, deepening your understanding of how the symmetry of both reactants and products dictates the final stereochemical composition [@problem_id:2201685].", "problem": "In a laboratory synthesis, the Diels-Alder reaction is performed by reacting 1,3-butadiene with methyl acrylate. Both starting materials are achiral. The reaction proceeds via a concerted [4+2] cycloaddition, and the major product isolated is the one formed in accordance with the endo rule, where the substituent on the dienophile is oriented towards the developing pi system of the diene in the transition state. Based on fundamental stereochemical principles, which of the following statements accurately characterizes the isolated endo product?\n\nA. The product is an achiral meso compound.\nB. The product is a single, optically active enantiomer.\nC. The product is a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\nD. The product is an achiral compound that is not a meso compound.", "solution": "The Diels-Alder reaction between 1,3-butadiene and methyl acrylate proceeds by a concerted, stereospecific [4+2] cycloaddition. Both starting materials are achiral, and the reaction follows the endo rule, which selects a particular diastereomeric orientation (endo versus exo) in the transition state. The stereochemical consequences are as follows:\n\n1) Nature of new stereocenters in the product:\n- In the cyclohexene product formed from a monosubstituted dienophile (methyl acrylate), the two carbons of the dienophile become adjacent ring carbons. The substituted alkene carbon (the one bearing the ester) becomes an $sp^3$ carbon bonded to four different substituents: hydrogen, the ester group, and two non-equivalent paths around the ring (one path passes immediately into the alkene moiety, the other does not). Therefore, this carbon is a stereogenic center.\n- The other three newly formed $sp^3$ carbons that originate from $\\text{CH}_2$ positions (the terminal carbons of the diene and the terminal carbon of the dienophile) remain $\\text{CH}_2$ units in the product and are not stereogenic because they bear two identical hydrogen substituents.\n\nConclusion: The product possesses exactly one stereogenic center.\n\n2) Chirality of the product:\n- A molecule with exactly one tetrahedral stereogenic center is chiral (it does not possess an internal mirror plane or inversion center that would render it achiral). It is not meso, because meso compounds require at least two stereogenic centers with an internal symmetry element.\n\n3) Consequence of achiral reactants and achiral conditions:\n- When achiral reactants react under achiral conditions to form a chiral product, both enantiomers of that product are formed in equal amounts due to equal probability of formation via enantiomeric transition states (attack from opposite, enantiotopic faces). The endo rule dictates which diastereomeric orientation is favored (endo over exo), but within the endo manifold, the two enantiomers are formed in equal amounts in the absence of any chiral influence.\n\nTherefore, the isolated endo product is obtained as a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n\nThis directly corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2201685"}]}
