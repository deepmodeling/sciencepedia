Nucleophilic addition of a methyl group generates two diastereomeric tertiary alcohols.

The reaction is known to proceed under chelation control, where the magnesium ion forms a stable intermediate with two oxygen atoms of the substrate. This chelation locks the substrate into a specific conformation before the nucleophilic addition of the methyl group occurs. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate description of the key features of the transition state that leads to the formation of the major diastereomeric product?\n\nA. The magnesium ion forms a five-membered chelate ring involving the carbonyl oxygen and the adjacent alkoxide oxygen. In this rigid structure, the methyl group on the chiral center orients itself away from the aldehyde to minimize steric strain. Consequently, the incoming methyl nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon from the face occupied by the smaller hydrogen atom on the chiral center.\n\nB.

Magnesium can coordinate simultaneously to the alkoxide oxygen and the carbonyl oxygen, forming a five-membered chelate ring. This is the classical chelation-controlled (Cram chelation model) scenario for alpha-alkoxy carbonyl compounds in ether solvents with Grignard reagents.\n\nEstablish the conformational consequence of chelation: The five-membered chelate rigidifies the substrate, fixing the relative orientation of the carbonyl and the adjacent chiral center. To minimize steric and torsional strain within the chelate, the larger substituent at the chiral center (the methyl group) adopts an orientation away from the carbonyl (avoiding eclipsing and minimizing steric interactions with the carbonyl group and the chelate framework), while the smaller substituent (hydrogen) occupies the face nearer to the carbonyl.\n\nDetermine the direction of nucleophilic approach: Nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl under this chelation-controlled rigid conformation proceeds along the less hindered face (Bürgi–Dunitz trajectory) of the carbonyl. Because the methyl group at the chiral center is oriented away from the carbonyl to minimize steric interactions, the less hindered face corresponds to the face associated with the smaller hydrogen substituent. Therefore, the incoming methyl group from MeMgBr attacks the carbonyl carbon from the face where the hydrogen lies, not from the face with the methyl substituent.\n\nCompare with the options:\n- A correctly states five-membered chelation, methyl at the chiral center oriented away from the aldehyde to minimize steric strain, and nucleophilic attack from the face occupied by the smaller hydrogen substituent.\n- B incorrectly claims attack from the more hindered face with the methyl substituent.\n- C incorrectly places the larger methyl substituent eclipsing the carbonyl, which is disfavored.\n- D and E propose non-chelation models, contradicting the stated chelation-controlled conditions.\n\nTherefore, the key features of the dominant transition state are those described in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2201452"}, {"introduction": "The Felkin-Anh and Cram chelation models are powerful predictors for reactions under kinetic control, where the product ratio is determined by the relative energies of the competing transition states.

By applying quantitative analysis involving Gibbs free energy, you will learn to distinguish between these two fundamental regimes of reactivity and appreciate how they can lead to vastly different stereochemical outcomes [@problem_id:2201432].", "problem": "An organic chemist is studying the stereochemical outcome of nucleophilic additions to the alpha-chiral aldehyde, (S)-2-methoxypropanal. Two different reactions are performed under distinct conditions.\n\n**Reaction A (Kinetic Control):**\nThe aldehyde is treated with methylmagnesium bromide (MeMgBr) in an ether solvent, followed by an acidic aqueous workup. This addition reaction is irreversible and therefore kinetically controlled. The reaction is observed to produce the two diastereomers of 3-methoxybutan-2-ol with a selectivity of 95:5, where the chelation-controlled product is the major component.\n\n**Reaction B (Thermodynamic Control):**\nIn a separate experiment, the aldehyde is treated with hydrogen cyanide (HCN) using a catalytic amount of potassium cyanide (KCN) as a base. The reaction is reversible and is allowed to proceed until equilibrium is established, placing the reaction under thermodynamic control. At the reaction temperature of $T=298.15$ K, the standard Gibbs free energy of the *syn* diastereomeric cyanohydrin product is higher than that of the *anti* diastereomer by 3.00 kJ/mol.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, the terms *syn* and *anti* refer to the relative stereochemistry of the newly formed hydroxyl group and the pre-existing methoxy group. When the main carbon backbone is drawn in a standard zigzag projection, if these two substituents point in the same general direction from the chain (e.g., both on wedges or both on dashes), the isomer is defined as *syn*. If they point in opposite directions, it is defined as *anti*.\n\nFor both reactions, the diastereomeric ratio, $dr$, is defined as the ratio of the concentration of the *syn* product to the concentration of the *anti* product. Let $dr_{kin}$ be the diastereomeric ratio from Reaction A and $dr_{th}$ be the diastereomeric ratio from Reaction B.\n\nCalculate the value of the quotient $Q = \\frac{dr_{kin}}{dr_{th}}$.

The outcome is kinetically controlled, meaning the product ratio is determined by the relative rates of formation of the diastereomers, which in turn depend on the energies of the respective transition states.\n\nThe starting aldehyde has an $\\alpha$-methoxy group. The oxygen atom of this group can coordinate to the Lewis acidic magnesium ion of the Grignard reagent. This leads to the formation of a rigid five-membered chelate ring involving the magnesium ion, the carbonyl oxygen, and the methoxy oxygen. This is the basis of the Cram chelation model.\n\nIn the chelated intermediate, the aldehyde is locked into a specific conformation. The nucleophile (the methyl group from MeMgBr) will then attack the carbonyl carbon from the less sterically hindered face. The two faces of the carbonyl are distinguished by the other substituents on the $\\alpha$-carbon: a hydrogen atom and a methyl group. Since the hydrogen atom is much smaller than the methyl group, the attack occurs from the face bearing the hydrogen atom. This approach leads to the formation of the *syn* diastereomer, where the new hydroxyl group and the existing methoxy group have a *syn* relationship.\n\nThe problem states that the chelation-controlled product is the major component and the selectivity is 95:5.

Since the reaction is allowed to reach equilibrium, the product ratio is determined by the relative thermodynamic stabilities of the two diastereomeric products. This is a case of thermodynamic control. The diastereomeric ratio at equilibrium, $dr_{th}$, is equal to the equilibrium constant, $K_{eq}$, for the interconversion of the two products.\n\nLet's consider the equilibrium between the two diastereomers:\n$$ \\text{anti-product} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{syn-product} $$\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is $K_{eq} = \\frac{[\\text{syn}]}{[\\text{anti}]}$.
