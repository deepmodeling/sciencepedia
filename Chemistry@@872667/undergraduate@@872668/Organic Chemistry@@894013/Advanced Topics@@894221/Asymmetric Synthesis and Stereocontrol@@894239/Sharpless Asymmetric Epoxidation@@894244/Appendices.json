The substrate is (E)-4-hydroxy-2-butenoic acid ($\\text{HOOC-CH=CH-CH}_2\\text{OH}$). The alcohol is allylic to the C2=C3 double bond. The reaction uses D-(−)-DET, which directs epoxidation to the **bottom face** of the alkene according to the Sharpless mnemonic. For an (E)-allylic alcohol like this one, bottom-face attack predictably yields the (2R,3S)-epoxide. This eliminates options A and D, which propose the wrong stereoisomer, and option E, which proposes a different product.\n\nNext, we must analyze the observed sluggish reaction and poor catalyst turnover. The active Sharpless catalyst is a Lewis acidic Ti(IV) complex that must reversibly bind the allylic alcohol. A free carboxylic acid in the substrate is highly problematic. Carboxylic acids are acidic enough to react with the basic alkoxide ligands on titanium, generating a carboxylate anion. This carboxylate can then bind very strongly to the Lewis acidic Ti(IV) center, typically chelating in a bidentate fashion through its two oxygen atoms. Such strong, often irreversible, binding poisons the catalyst by blocking the coordination sites needed for the allylic alcohol and the oxidant, thus halting catalytic turnover. This is a well-known cause of catalyst deactivation in SAE when substrates contain unprotected acids.\n\nAlternative deactivation hypotheses are less plausible. While product inhibition (Option C) can occur, the immediate sluggishness is better explained by the starting material itself deactivating the catalyst. Acid-induced hydrolysis of the tartrate ligand (Option D) is not a primary deactivation pathway under these conditions.\n\nPutting these two points together, the expected major product is (2R,3S)-2,3-epoxy-4-hydroxybutanoic acid, and the most plausible reason for catalyst deactivation is the strong, bidentate coordination of the substrate’s carboxylate group to the Ti(IV) center.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2199062"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the full catalytic cycle is key to mastering any catalytic reaction, and this includes knowing what can cause it to fail. This problem explores the important distinction between a catalytic and a stoichiometric reaction protocol, particularly in the context of a kinetic resolution. By analyzing why a catalytic approach might stall while a stoichiometric one succeeds, you will uncover the concept of product inhibition, a critical factor that can arrest catalytic turnover and impact the feasibility of a synthesis. [@problem_id:2199069]", "problem": "An organic chemist is investigating the kinetic resolution of racemic 4-methyl-1-penten-3-ol using the Sharpless Asymmetric Epoxidation (SAE) protocol. The goal is to isolate one enantiomer of the starting alcohol in high enantiomeric purity. Two separate experiments are conducted.\n\n**Experiment A (Catalytic Protocol):**\nThe racemic alcohol is treated with 1.5 equivalents of tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as the oxidant in the presence of 5 mol% titanium(IV) isopropoxide ($Ti(\\text{O}^i\\text{Pr})_4$) and 6 mol% (+)-diethyl tartrate ((+)-DET). The reaction is monitored by chiral chromatography. After an initial period of rapid conversion, the reaction rate slows drastically and effectively stops when only 35% of the starting material has been consumed. The remaining unreacted alcohol is isolated and found to have a modest enantiomeric excess.\n\n**Experiment B (Stoichiometric Protocol):**\nThe racemic alcohol is treated with 0.6 equivalents of a pre-formed complex made from 1.2 equivalents of $Ti(\\text{O}^i\\text{Pr})_4$ and 1.2 equivalents of (+)-DET, followed by the addition of TBHP. In this case, the reaction proceeds smoothly until approximately 50% of the starting material is consumed. Halting the reaction at this point and isolating the unreacted alcohol reveals it to have a very high enantiomeric excess, consistent with a successful kinetic resolution.\n\nBased on these observations, select the most accurate chemical explanation for why the stoichiometric protocol (Experiment B) is significantly more effective than the catalytic protocol (Experiment A) for this specific kinetic resolution.\n\nA) Under catalytic conditions, the TBHP oxidant causes slow decomposition of the titanium-tartrate complex. The stoichiometric reaction is complete before significant catalyst decomposition can occur, whereas the catalytic reaction is too slow and the catalyst degrades.\n\nB) The product of the epoxidation is a 2,3-epoxy alcohol, which acts as a potent bidentate ligand. In the catalytic protocol, this product binds very tightly to the titanium center, causing product inhibition and halting catalytic turnover. The stoichiometric protocol avoids this issue as there is no requirement for catalyst turnover.\n\nC) The catalytic reaction has an intrinsically low turnover frequency for this sterically hindered substrate. Using a stoichiometric amount of the reagent simply increases the overall reaction rate to a synthetically useful level, allowing it to reach 50% conversion in a reasonable time frame.\n\nD) The isopropanol produced from the titanium(IV) isopropoxide starting material competes with the allylic alcohol for binding to the catalyst in Experiment A. In Experiment B, the pre-formed complex minimizes the concentration of free isopropanol, leading to a more efficient reaction.\n\nE) In the catalytic protocol, trace amounts of water lead to the formation of inactive Ti-O-Ti oligomers. The higher concentration of the complex in the stoichiometric protocol makes the reaction less sensitive to this deactivation pathway.", "solution": "We analyze the Sharpless Asymmetric Epoxidation (SAE) as a catalytic cycle in which an allylic alcohol $S$ binds to a chiral titanium–tartrate complex to form a chelated substrate–catalyst complex, which then reacts with TBHP to deliver epoxide product $P$ and regenerate the active titanium species. In kinetic resolution, one enantiomer of $S$ reacts faster, so the ideal outcome is to stop the reaction at approximately one-half conversion to isolate the unreacted alcohol in high enantiomeric excess.\n\nThe key physical principle governing the difference between Experiment A and Experiment B is product inhibition by tight binding of the epoxy alcohol product to the titanium center. Let $[Ti]_{\\text{tot}}$ be the total titanium concentration, $[Ti]_{\\text{free}}$ the free active titanium sites, and $K_{S}$ and $K_{P}$ the equilibrium association constants for binding of $S$ and $P$, respectively. Writing the standard site-balance with competitive binding,\n$$\n[Ti]_{\\text{tot}} = [Ti]_{\\text{free}} \\left( 1 + K_{S}[S] + K_{P}[P] + \\dots \\right),\n$$\nso\n$$\n[Ti]_{\\text{free}} = \\frac{[Ti]_{\\text{tot}}}{1 + K_{S}[S] + K_{P}[P] + \\dots}.\n$$\nIf the epoxidation product is a 2,3-epoxy alcohol, it can chelate strongly to titanium (bidentate binding via the epoxide oxygen and the alcohol), which corresponds to $K_{P} \\gg K_{S}$. As $[P]$ increases during the catalytic reaction, the denominator grows rapidly, forcing $[Ti]_{\\text{free}} \\to 0$ even when substantial $[S]$ remains. The catalytic rate scales as\n$$\nv = k_{\\text{cat}} [Ti]_{\\text{free}} [S],\n$$\nso as $[P]$ builds, $v$ collapses due to the large $K_{P}[P]$ term, and the reaction can stall well before reaching one-half conversion. This explains the observation in Experiment A that the reaction effectively stops around 35% consumption of $S$ with only modest enrichment of the unreacted alcohol: the catalyst is trapped as $Ti\\!\\cdot\\!P$ and cannot turn over further.\n\nIn the stoichiometric protocol (Experiment B), a pre-formed titanium–tartrate complex is used in an amount on the order of the required epoxidation events (here, 0.6 equivalents relative to $S$), so the process does not rely on multiple turnovers. Even if product binding is extremely strong and the catalyst is sequestered as $Ti\\!\\cdot\\!P$ after each epoxidation event, each titanium center only needs to effect approximately one reaction to reach the target of about 50% consumption of $S$. In this regime, product inhibition does not prevent achieving approximately one-half conversion; it merely arrests further turnover beyond that point. Halting at about one-half conversion thus yields the unreacted alcohol with very high enantiomeric excess, consistent with successful kinetic resolution.\n\nAlternative explanations are less consistent with the data and known SAE behavior: (A) generalized TBHP-induced decomposition would not specifically induce a sharp plateau at approximately 35% consumption, and catalytic SAE is typically robust to TBHP under standard conditions; (C) a low intrinsic turnover frequency would slow the reaction but would not cause the abrupt stalling well below 50% conversion, nor explain why a stoichiometric protocol uniquely solves the problem; (D) competition from isopropanol is not uniquely mitigated by preforming the complex and is not the dominant determinant of the observed plateau; (E) water-induced Ti–O–Ti oligomerization would not be selectively bypassed by using stoichiometric amounts in a way that allows smooth progress to approximately 50% conversion.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate explanation is strong product inhibition by the epoxy alcohol, which blocks catalytic turnover in Experiment A, while Experiment B succeeds because it does not require turnover beyond approximately one reaction per titanium center.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2199069"}]}
