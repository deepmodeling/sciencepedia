This first exercise presents a hypothetical scenario common in a teaching lab: a key reagent is accidentally omitted. By thinking through the consequences, you will clarify the distinct roles of the chiral catalyst and the stoichiometric borane source in the CBS reduction, a foundational concept for troubleshooting and reaction design [@problem_id:2163803].", "problem": "An undergraduate student is tasked with synthesizing an enantiomerically enriched sample of 1-phenylethanol starting from acetophenone. The chosen procedure is a Corey-Bakshi-Shibata (CBS) reduction, a well-established method for the asymmetric reduction of prochiral ketones.\n\nThe student prepares a reaction flask under an inert nitrogen atmosphere and adds the substrate, acetophenone, along with a catalytic amount of the (S)-CBS catalyst (an (S)-2-methyl-CBS-oxazaborolidine). The solvent used is dry toluene. However, the student forgets to add the borane-tetrahydrofuran complex (BH₃·THF), which is the stoichiometric reducing agent specified in the protocol. The mixture is stirred at the prescribed temperature for several hours, after which the student proceeds with a standard aqueous workup protocol designed to quench the reaction and isolate the organic product.\n\nAssuming the workup is performed correctly, which of the following best describes the major organic compound(s) that will be isolated from the final organic extract?\n\nA. Racemic (R,S)-1-phenylethanol\nB. Enantiomerically enriched (R)-1-phenylethanol\nC. Enantiomerically enriched (S)-1-phenylethanol\nD. Acetophenone\nE. A stable, covalently-bonded adduct of acetophenone and the (S)-CBS catalyst", "solution": "The Corey-Bakshi-Shibata (CBS) reduction of a prochiral ketone requires two distinct components: a chiral oxazaborolidine catalyst and a stoichiometric hydride source, typically $BH_{3}\\cdot THF$. The catalyst alone is not a hydride donor; rather, it forms an activated complex with borane that orients the ketone and delivers hydride enantioselectively. The essential mechanistic step for reduction is hydride transfer from a borane-derived species coordinated to the CBS catalyst to the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the ketone.\n\nIn the present scenario, acetophenone is mixed with a catalytic amount of the $(S)$-CBS catalyst in dry toluene under nitrogen, but $BH_{3}\\cdot THF$ is omitted. Without $BH_{3}$, no hydride source is present, so no reduction can occur. The CBS catalyst may act as a Lewis acid and could transiently coordinate to the carbonyl oxygen of acetophenone, but such a Lewis acid-base interaction is reversible and does not constitute a stable, covalently bonded adduct that would persist through an aqueous workup. Upon quench and extraction, any such noncovalent or labile Lewis adduct would dissociate or hydrolyze, and the catalyst would be removed or remain in minor amounts relative to the substrate.\n\nConsequently:\n- Options A, B, and C, which all require formation of 1-phenylethanol, are precluded because no hydride donor is present to effect reduction.\n- Option E is incorrect because a stable, isolable, covalently bonded adduct between acetophenone and the $(S)$-CBS catalyst is not expected under these conditions and would not survive aqueous workup as the major organic species.\n- The substrate remains unchanged, so the major organic compound isolated from the organic extract will be acetophenone.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2163803"}, {"introduction": "Having established the roles of the key reagents, we now turn to the heart of asymmetric catalysis: the source of chirality. This practice explores what happens when a racemic catalyst is used instead of an enantiopure one. This thought experiment is crucial for understanding that the catalyst's three-dimensional structure is the 'information' that directs the formation of one enantiomer over the other, a principle that applies across all of asymmetric synthesis [@problem_id:2163773].", "problem": "In a laboratory experiment, a student attempts to perform an asymmetric reduction of acetophenone to 1-phenylethanol using a Corey-Bakshi-Shibata (CBS) reduction protocol. The procedure calls for a chiral oxazaborolidine catalyst, which is typically prepared from an enantiopure amino alcohol, and a stoichiometric reducing agent, borane-tetrahydrofuran complex ($BH_3 \\cdot THF$). However, due to a laboratory mix-up, the oxazaborolidine catalyst was synthesized using racemic proline instead of the required enantiopure (S)-proline.\n\nAssuming the reaction proceeds to completion, which of the following statements best describes the product mixture and its properties?\n\nA. A single enantiomer of 1-phenylethanol is formed, and the resulting solution is optically active.\nB. A racemic mixture of 1-phenylethanol is formed, and the resulting solution is optically inactive.\nC. A mixture of diastereomers of 1-phenylethanol is formed.\nD. A scalemic (non-racemic) mixture of 1-phenylethanol enantiomers is formed, and the resulting solution is optically active.\nE.

Each enantiomer of the catalyst gives the opposite enantiomer of the product: the two catalyst enantiomers are mirror images and create enantiomeric transition states when reacting with an achiral substrate such as acetophenone.\n\nLet the two catalyst enantiomers be present in equal amounts (racemic catalyst). For an achiral substrate, the transition states they induce are enantiomeric and therefore have equal activation free energies:\n$$\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{R^{*}\\to R}=\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{S^{*}\\to S},$$\nwhich implies equal rate constants for formation of the two enantiomers:\n$$k_{R^{*}}=k_{S^{*}}.$$\nConsequently, the amounts of the two product enantiomers are equal, so the mixture is racemic:\n$$[R]=[S],\\quad ee=\\frac{|[R]-[S]|}{[R]+[S]}=0.$$\n\nThe optical rotation of a racemic mixture is zero because the contributions of equal amounts of opposite enantiomers cancel:\n$$\\alpha_{\\text{obs}}=\\alpha_{R}x_{R}+\\alpha_{S}x_{S}=\\alpha x+(-\\alpha)x=0.$$\n\nNo diastereomers are possible because the product (1-phenylethanol) has only one stereocenter and the substrate is achiral, so the only stereoisomers are enantiomers. The reaction still proceeds because both enantiomers of the oxazaborolidine catalyst are catalytically competent and $BH_{3}\\cdot THF$ is an effective reducing agent; only enantioselectivity is lost.\n\nTherefore, the product is a racemic mixture that is optically inactive, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2163773"}, {"introduction": "After performing an asymmetric reaction, chemists must assess its success.
