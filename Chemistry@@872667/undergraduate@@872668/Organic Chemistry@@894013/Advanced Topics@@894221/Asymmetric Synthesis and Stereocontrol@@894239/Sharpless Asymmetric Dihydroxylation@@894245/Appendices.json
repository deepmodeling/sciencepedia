This reaction utilizes a catalytic amount of osmium tetroxide in the presence of a stoichiometric oxidant and a chiral ligand, typically delivered as a pre-packaged mixture known as AD-mix (Asymmetric Dihydroxylation mix).

(Z)-hex-2-ene\n\nE. 1-hexene", "solution": "Goal: obtain the meso diol, specifically hexane-3,4-diol with configurations $(3R,4S)$, via Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation, which proceeds by *syn* addition of two $\\mathrm{OH}$ groups across an alkene.\n\nFirst, to form hexane-3,4-diol, the double bond in the starting alkene must be between C3 and C4. Therefore, the correct positional isomer must be hex-3-ene rather than hex-2-ene or 1-hexene, since dihydroxylation of hex-2-ene gives a 2,3-diol and of 1-hexene gives a 1,2-diol.\n\nSecond, consider the stereochemical outcome of *syn* dihydroxylation on an internal disubstituted alkene. For a symmetric alkene of the form $RCH=CHR$:\n- *Syn* addition to the $Z$ (cis) alkene places both new $\\mathrm{OH}$ groups on the same face of the double bond. Because each alkene carbon has the same substituents but with reversed priority order when assigning configuration on opposite carbons, the two new stereocenters acquire opposite configurations, $(R,S)$, generating an internal mirror plane in the product; thus the vicinal diol is meso.\n- *Syn* addition to the $E$ (trans) alkene also places both $\\mathrm{OH}$ groups on the same face, but now the substituent arrangement leads to identical configurations at the two new stereocenters, yielding a racemic mixture of $(R,R)$ and $(S,S)$ diols rather than a meso compound.\n\nApplying this to hex-3-ene, which is symmetric ($\\mathrm{CH_{3}CH_{2}CH=CHCH_{2}CH_{3}}$), the $Z$ isomer under *syn* dihydroxylation gives the meso hexane-3,4-diol $(3R,4S)$ (identical to $(3S,4R)$ by internal symmetry), while the $E$ isomer gives a racemic pair $(3R,4R)$ and $(3S,4S)$. Hence, among the options, only $(Z)$-hex-3-ene furnishes the desired meso diol. The other listed alkenes either position the diol incorrectly (hex-2-ene, 1-hexene) or give racemic products instead of meso (the $E$ isomers).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2198802"}, {"introduction": "Beyond just predicting products, a true understanding of a reaction comes from knowing the precise role of each reagent. This thought experiment [@problem_id:2198810] asks you to consider the consequences of omitting a key component—the base—from the reaction mixture. By analyzing the catalytic cycle, you can deduce why this omission is catastrophic and gain a deeper appreciation for the intricate machinery of the Sharpless dihydroxylation.", "problem": "An undergraduate student is tasked with performing a Sharpless Asymmetric Dihydroxylation (AD) on (E)-stilbene, which has the chemical structure C6H5-CH=CH-C6H5. The standard protocol involves dissolving the alkene in a tert-butanol/water solvent system and treating it with \"AD-mix-β\". AD-mix-β is a commercially available, pre-packaged mixture of reagents containing a catalytic amount of potassium osmate (K2OsO2(OH)4) as the osmium source, a stoichiometric amount of potassium ferricyanide (K3[Fe(CN)6]) as the co-oxidant, a chiral ligand ((DHQD)2PHAL), and potassium carbonate (K2CO3) as a base.\n\nIn a procedural error, the student prepares a custom mixture containing all the correct components in their proper ratios *except* for the potassium carbonate, which is completely omitted. Assuming all other conditions are ideal, what is the most significant and immediate chemical consequence of this omission?\n\nA. The reaction will proceed to completion to form the diol, but with no enantioselectivity, resulting in a racemic product.\n\nB. The reaction will proceed to completion, but it will yield the enantiomer of the diol that is typically produced by AD-mix-α.\n\nC. The oxidation of (E)-stilbene will be minimal, and the reaction will effectively halt after producing only a very small, stoichiometric yield of the diol.\n\nD. The co-oxidant, potassium ferricyanide, will rapidly oxidize and degrade the chiral ligand in the absence of the base, preventing any dihydroxylation from occurring.\n\nE. The reaction will proceed to completion with the expected high enantioselectivity, but the overall reaction rate will be significantly slower.", "solution": "We identify the role of each component in the Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation (AD) catalytic cycle under standard conditions and then deduce the effect of omitting potassium carbonate.\n\n1) Standard catalytic cycle components and roles:\n- Osmium source: potassium osmate provides the catalytically active osmium species after oxidation to an Os(VIII) tetraoxo complex coordinated by the chiral ligand. The chiral ligand controls the enantioselective approach of the alkene.\n- Co-oxidant: potassium ferricyanide reoxidizes the reduced osmium after dihydroxylation, enabling catalytic turnover.\n- Base (potassium carbonate): maintains a basic pH, which (i) converts osmium species into their anionic hydroxo forms, improving solubility and reactivity; (ii) promotes hydrolysis (cleavage) of the cyclic osmate ester to release the vicinal diol; and (iii) enables efficient reoxidation of Os(VI) to Os(VIII) by ferricyanide.\n\n2) Elementary steps in the AD cycle:\n- Asymmetric cycloaddition of Os(VIII) to the alkene to give a cyclic osmate ester (Os(VI)):\n$$\\text{Os}^{\\text{VIII}} + \\text{alkene} \\rightarrow \\text{osmate ester}(\\text{Os}^{\\text{VI}})$$\n- Hydrolytic cleavage of the osmate ester to release the vicinal diol and generate a hydroxo Os(VI) species; this step is base-promoted:\n$$\\text{osmate ester} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O} \\xrightarrow{\\text{base}} \\text{vicinal diol} + \\text{Os}^{\\text{VI}}(\\text{hydroxo})$$\n- Reoxidation of Os(VI) to Os(VIII) by ferricyanide; this step is efficient under basic conditions where the osmium exists as an anionic hydroxo complex:\n$$\\text{Os}^{\\text{VI}} + \\text{Fe}(\\text{CN})_{6}^{3-} \\xrightarrow{\\text{base}} \\text{Os}^{\\text{VIII}} + \\text{Fe}(\\text{CN})_{6}^{4-}$$\n\n3) Consequence of omitting potassium carbonate:\n- Without base, the hydrolysis of the osmate ester is greatly slowed or arrested, so release of the diol is inefficient. Even if hydrolysis occurs to a small extent, the reoxidation of Os(VI) to Os(VIII) by ferricyanide is highly inefficient in the absence of basic conditions that stabilize the necessary anionic osmium hydroxo species. Thus, catalytic turnover is effectively shut down.\n- As a result, the reaction does not proceed to completion. At most, a very small amount of diol can form corresponding to the limited, non-catalytic conversion enabled by the initially available high-valent osmium species before the cycle stalls. Because only a catalytic amount of osmium is present, the total diol formed is minimal.\n- The stereochemical outcome (enantioselectivity) is governed by the chiral ligand, not by the base; omitting base does not invert or erase enantioselection by itself. The dominant and immediate effect is failure of catalytic turnover, not a change in enantioselectivity or ligand degradation.\n\n4) Evaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect because the chiral ligand remains and enantioselection is not nullified specifically by removing base; the primary issue is turnover failure, not racemization.\n- B is incorrect because enantiomeric sense is dictated by the ligand (DHQ vs DHQD systems), not by the presence of base; removing base does not invert selectivity.\n- C is correct: absent base, hydrolysis and reoxidation steps are crippled, so oxidation is minimal and the reaction stalls after a very small, effectively stoichiometric amount relative to the initially available high-valent osmium species.\n- D is incorrect: ferricyanide does not primarily and rapidly degrade the chiral ligand upon omission of base; the immediate and significant effect is failure of the osmium reoxidation/hydrolysis sequence.\n- E is incorrect: the reaction does not simply slow; it fails to achieve catalytic turnover and will not proceed to completion.\n\nTherefore, the most significant and immediate chemical consequence of omitting potassium carbonate is that the oxidation of the alkene is minimal and the reaction effectively halts after a very small, stoichiometric yield of diol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2198810"}, {"introduction": "The goal of asymmetric synthesis is not just to make a chiral molecule, but to make one enantiomer in preference to the other.
