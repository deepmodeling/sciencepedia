The starting material is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, a compound commonly used as a topical anesthetic (benzocaine). This compound is first dissolved in a dilute aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid, and the resulting mixture is cooled in an ice bath to maintain a temperature between 0 °C and 5 °C.

In the presence of dilute aqueous hydrochloric acid kept at a low temperature (between 0 and 5 degrees Celsius), addition of one stoichiometric equivalent of sodium nitrite generates nitrous acid in situ by acid-base reaction between sodium nitrite and hydrochloric acid:\n$NaNO_2 + HCl \\rightarrow HNO_2 + NaCl$.\n\nUnder strongly acidic conditions, nitrous acid is protonated and loses water to produce the nitrosonium electrophile:\n$HNO_2 + H^+ \\rightleftharpoons H_2NO_2^+$\n$H_2NO_2^+ \\rightarrow NO^+ + H_2O$\nEquivalently, $HNO_2$ and $HCl$ can form $NOCl$, which serves as a source of $NO^+$ in solution.\n\nA primary aryl amine undergoes nitrosation at nitrogen with $NO^+$ to give an N-nitrosamine intermediate, which tautomerizes to a diazohydroxide and then, upon protonation and loss of water, forms the aryl diazonium ion. The sequence is:\n1) Formation of N-nitrosamine: $ArNH_2$ + $NO^+$ → $ArNH–NO$ (after deprotonation/reprotonation steps).\n2) Conversion to diazohydroxide: $ArNH–NO$ ⇌ $Ar-N=N-OH$ (by proton transfers).\n3) Formation of the diazonium ion: protonation of the hydroxyl in $Ar-N=N-OH$ followed by dehydration gives $ArN_2^+$.\n\nBecause the medium contains chloride from hydrochloric acid, the counterion is chloride, giving the aryldiazonium chloride salt. At 0 to 5 degrees Celsius, aryl diazonium salts are sufficiently stable to persist as the major product without further substitution.\n\nAlternative products are disfavored under the stated conditions:\n- Phenol formation ($Ar-OH$) generally occurs via hydrolysis of the diazonium ion at elevated temperatures or prolonged aqueous conditions; at 0 to 5 degrees Celsius, hydrolysis is minimized.\n- N-nitrosamines are stable for secondary amines; primary aromatic amines proceed onward to diazonium ions rather than accumulate as N-nitrosamines.\n- Aryl chlorides require a cuprous catalyst (Sandmeyer reaction) or other specific conditions not provided here.\n- Amide formation (acetylation) requires an acylating reagent such as acetic anhydride or acetyl chloride, which is absent.\n\nTherefore, the single major organic product stable under these conditions is the aryldiazonium salt, specifically ethyl 4-(diazonio)benzoate chloride.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2194582"}, {"introduction": "While aromatic amines yield relatively stable diazonium salts, their aliphatic counterparts behave quite differently, offering a window into the fascinating world of carbocation chemistry. This exercise challenges you to work backward from a final alcohol product to deduce the structure of the starting primary aliphatic amine [@problem_id:2194590].

Symbolically:\n$$\nRCH_2NH_2 + HONO + H^+ \\rightarrow RCH_2N_2^+ + 2H_2O \\rightarrow RCH_2^+ + N_2 \\rightarrow \\text{products}\n$$\n- Secondary aliphatic amines form $N$-nitrosamines (no $N_2$ gas).\n- Tertiary aliphatic amines form ammonium nitrites (no $N_2$ gas).\n\nTherefore, the vigorous evolution of a colorless, odorless gas identifies $N_2$ and implies a primary aliphatic amine. This immediately excludes options D (secondary) and E (tertiary).\n\nPrinciple 2: The isolated alcohol identifies the carbocation formed after loss of $N_2$. The product is tert-butanol (2-methyl-2-propanol), which arises from the tert-butyl cation ($(CH_3)_3C^+$) being trapped by water:\n$$\n(CH_3)_3C^+ + H_2O \\rightarrow (CH_3)_3COH + H^+\n$$\n\nWe now test which primary $C_4$ amine can furnish $(CH_3)_3C^+$ under diazotization.\n\nOption B: Butan-1-amine, $CH_3CH_2CH_2CH_2NH_2$. Diazotization at the terminal carbon gives a primary cation $CH_3CH_2CH_2CH_2^+$, which may rearrange to a secondary cation $CH_3CH_2CH^+CH_3$ by a 1,2-hydride shift. Formation of the tert-butyl cation $(CH_3)_3C^+$ would require multiple rearrangements and is not the straightforward or predominant outcome; the expected main alcohols are butan-1-ol and butan-2-ol, not tert-butanol. Thus B is inconsistent with the observed main product.\n\nOption C: Butan-2-amine, $CH_3CH(NH_2)CH_2CH_3$. Diazotization at $C_2$ gives a secondary carbocation $CH_3C^+HCH_2CH_3$, which is trapped to give 2-butanol. Achieving $(CH_3)_3C^+$ from this requires sequential rearrangements and is not expected to give tert-butanol as the main product. Thus C is inconsistent.\n\nOption A: 2-Methylpropan-1-amine (isobutylamine), $CH_3CH(CH_3)CH_2NH_2$. Diazotization at the primary $CH_2$ yields the primary carbocation $CH_3CH(CH_3)CH_2^+$. A favorable 1,2-hydride shift from the adjacent tertiary carbon to the primary cation center forms the more stable tertiary tert-butyl cation:\n$$\nCH_3CH(CH_3)CH_2^+ \\xrightarrow{\\text{1,2-hydride shift}} (CH_3)_3C^+\n$$\nWater capture then gives tert-butanol as the main product:\n$$\n(CH_3)_3C^+ + H_2O \\rightarrow (CH_3)_3COH + H^+\n$$\nThis pathway both explains the vigorous $N_2$ evolution (primary amine) and furnishes 2-methyl-2-propanol as the principal product via a single, strongly favorable hydride shift to a tertiary carbocation.\n\nTherefore, among the provided options, only A is fully consistent with both the gas evolution and the identification of 2-methyl-2-propanol as the main product.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2194590"}, {"introduction": "Having explored carbocation formation in the diazotization of aliphatic amines, we now probe the reaction's stereochemical consequences. This problem presents a scenario where a chiral amine yields a non-racemic mixture of alcohol products, a result that a simple, free carbocation model cannot explain [@problem_id:2194595]. Your task is to select the mechanistic explanation that best accounts for this partial inversion of stereochemistry, revealing the subtle but crucial role of ion-pair intermediates in dictating reaction outcomes.", "problem": "When a pure enantiomeric sample of (R)-2-aminobutane is treated with aqueous sodium nitrite and hydrochloric acid at low temperature, a substitution reaction occurs. The unstable intermediate formed rapidly decomposes, liberating nitrogen gas and yielding a mixture of alcohols upon reaction with water. Careful analysis of the resulting alcohol mixture reveals that it consists of 65% (S)-butan-2-ol and 35% (R)-butan-2-ol.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the best mechanistic explanation for this specific stereochemical outcome?\n\nA. The carbocation intermediate formed after the loss of nitrogen is not completely free. The departing nitrogen molecule partially shields the front face of the carbocation, favoring nucleophilic attack by water from the rear face.\nB. The reaction proceeds through a direct, one-step $\\mathrm{S_N2}$ mechanism, where a water molecule acts as a nucleophile and displaces the diazonium group, leading to complete inversion of configuration.\nC. The reaction forms a stable, planar, and fully solvated secondary carbocation intermediate. Water, as a nucleophile, attacks this symmetrical intermediate from either face with equal probability.\nD. To achieve greater stability, the initially formed secondary carbocation undergoes a hydride shift to form a primary carbocation before being attacked by water.\nE. The (S)-butan-2-ol product is thermodynamically more stable than the (R)-butan-2-ol product, and the reaction proceeds to form the products in a ratio that reflects their relative stabilities.", "solution": "The substrate is a chiral, primary aliphatic amine at a secondary stereogenic center. Under aqueous sodium nitrite and hydrochloric acid at low temperature, nitrous acid generates the nitrosyl cation, which converts the primary amine into an alkyldiazonium ion at the stereogenic carbon. Aliphatic diazonium ions are unstable and expel nitrogen to form a carbocation at the same carbon. The key mechanistic question is whether this carbocation is a fully solvated, free carbocation or remains as a tight ion pair with the departing nitrogen (and counterion) that can shield one face.\n\nIf the carbocation were fully free and planar, attack by water would occur with equal probability from either face, giving a racemic mixture, i.e., an equal ratio of the two enantiomers. That prediction is $0.50:0.50$, which contradicts the observed $0.65:0.35$ ratio. Therefore, a fully free, fully solvated carbocation (as in option C) cannot explain the data.\n\nIf the reaction proceeded by a direct one-step $\\mathrm{S_N2}$ displacement of the diazonium group by water, the outcome would be complete inversion at the stereocenter, approaching $1.00:0.00$ (all inversion). The observed partial inversion excess $0.65:0.35$ contradicts such a simple $\\mathrm{S_N2}$ pathway (option B).\n\nA hydride shift from a secondary carbocation to a primary carbocation (option D) would be thermodynamically unfavorable and mechanistically unnecessary; moreover, it provides no rationale for the specific enantiomeric excess observed. Likewise, invoking thermodynamic preference of one enantiomer over the other (option E) is invalid in an achiral environment, since enantiomers have identical thermodynamic stabilities; thus product ratios cannot reflect a thermodynamic difference between enantiomers.\n\nThe observed stereochemical outcome is characteristic of ion-pair or solvent-cage effects. After loss of nitrogen begins, the developing carbocation is not completely free; instead, the departing nitrogen molecule and counterion remain in close proximity on one face (an intimate ion pair), partially blocking that face. Water therefore preferentially attacks from the opposite (unshielded) face, giving more inversion than retention. Simultaneously, a fraction of intermediates can escape the cage to a fully solvated, planar carbocation, which is then attacked from either face equally, contributing a racemic component.\n\nThis mixed-pathway model quantitatively explains the data. Let $f$ be the fraction of the reaction that proceeds through the tight ion pair pathway, which yields exclusive inversion from the starting (R) configuration to the (S) product. Let $1-f$ be the fraction that forms a free carbocation, giving a racemic contribution (50% S, 50% R). Then the mole fractions of products are:\n$$\nx_{S} = f \\cdot (1) + (1-f) \\cdot (0.5) = \\frac{1+f}{2}\n$$\n$$\nx_{R} = f \\cdot (0) + (1-f) \\cdot (0.5) = \\frac{1-f}{2}\n$$\nGiven $x_{S} = 0.65$ and $x_{R} = 0.35$, we can solve for $f$:\n$$\n\\frac{1+f}{2} = 0.65 \\implies 1+f = 1.3 \\implies f = 0.30\n$$\nThis also gives the correct fraction for the R product:\n$$\nx_{R} = \\frac{1-0.30}{2} = \\frac{0.70}{2} = 0.35\n$$\nThis means that approximately 30% of the reaction proceeds through a pathway that enforces inversion (the ion-pair pathway), while 70% proceeds through a pathway that gives racemization (the free carbocation pathway). This is precisely the mechanistic rationale described in option A: the carbocation is not completely free, and the departing nitrogen shields one face, biasing attack from the opposite face and producing an excess of inversion.\n\nTherefore, the best mechanistic explanation is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2194595"}]}
