This exercise challenges you to identify a common error in naming an aliphatic amine, reinforcing the crucial principle of assigning the lowest possible number (locant) to the principal functional group. Mastering this rule is a cornerstone of systematic nomenclature and essential for clear chemical communication.

The student proposes the name `3,5-dimethylhexan-4-amine`. However, this name is incorrect because it violates a fundamental IUPAC numbering rule.\n\nWhat is the correct IUPAC name for this compound?\n\nA. 2,4-dimethylhexan-3-amine\n\nB. 3,5-dimethylhexan-4-amine\n\nC. 2,4-dimethylhexan-4-amine\n\nD. 3,5-dimethylhexan-3-amine\n\nE. 3-amino-2,4-dimethylhexane", "solution": "Identify the principal functional group: a primary amine. In IUPAC substitutive nomenclature, the amine is expressed as the suffix “-amine,” and its position (the carbon bearing the amino group) must receive the lowest possible locant in the parent chain numbering.\n\nSelect the parent chain: the longest chain containing the carbon bearing the amino group is a hexane backbone (hexane).\n\nConsider the two possible numbering directions along the hexane chain:\n- If numbered so that the amino group is at carbon 4, the substituents appear at carbons 3 and 5, giving the proposed name “3,5-dimethylhexan-4-amine.”\n- If numbered from the opposite end, the amino group is at carbon 3, and the substituents are at carbons 2 and 4, giving “2,4-dimethylhexan-3-amine.”\n\nApply the IUPAC lowest-locant rule with priority to the suffix functional group: the locant for the amine must be minimized first. Between 4 and 3, choose 3. Therefore, the correct numbering places the amine at carbon 3 and the methyl groups at carbons 2 and 4.\n\nAssemble the name accordingly: 2,4-dimethylhexan-3-amine. This corresponds to option A. Options B and D violate the lowest locant for the principal functional group; option E uses the prefix “amino” rather than the preferred suffix when the amine is the principal group.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2205502"}, {"introduction": "A key skill in organic chemistry is predicting a molecule's chemical behavior from its structure. This practice explores how an amine's basicity—its ability to accept a proton—is profoundly influenced by the electronic effects of substituents on an aromatic ring. By analyzing how electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups alter the availability of the nitrogen's lone pair, you will develop the chemical intuition needed to rank the relative strengths of bases qualitatively. [@problem_id:2205491]", "problem": "An organic chemist is studying the effect of substituents on the chemical properties of aromatic amines. Four aniline derivatives are considered:\n- Compound I: Aniline\n- Compound II: p-nitroaniline\n- Compound III: p-methylaniline\n- Compound IV: p-methoxyaniline\n\nYour task is to arrange these four compounds in order of increasing basicity. Basicity in this context refers to the ability of the amino group's nitrogen atom to accept a proton in an acid-base reaction. Which of the following options correctly represents the order from least basic to most basic?\n\nA) II < I < III < IV\n\nB) IV < III < I < II\n\nC) II < I < IV < III\n\nD) I < II < III < IV\n\nE) III < IV < I < II", "solution": "Basicity of an aromatic amine refers to the tendency of the nitrogen lone pair to accept a proton. For an aniline derivative $\\mathrm{ArNH_{2}}$, the relevant equilibrium is\n$$\\mathrm{ArNH_{2} + H^{+} \\rightleftharpoons ArNH_{3}^{+}},$$\nand basicity increases with greater electron density on the nitrogen lone pair and decreases when that lone pair is rendered less available by delocalization or electron withdrawal. Substituent effects are evaluated via inductive effects ($+I$ donates, $-I$ withdraws) and resonance (mesomeric) effects ($+M$ donates, $-M$ withdraws) transmitted through the aromatic ring.\n\nFor the reference compound, aniline (Compound I), the nitrogen lone pair is partially delocalized into the ring via resonance, which makes aniline less basic than typical aliphatic amines. Substituents at the para position modulate this baseline.\n\nFor p-nitroaniline (Compound II), the $\\mathrm{NO_{2}}$ group is a strong $-M$ and $-I$ substituent. Its $-M$ effect withdraws electron density from the ring by resonance, which competes with and enhances delocalization of the nitrogen lone pair into the ring, thereby decreasing its availability for protonation. Its $-I$ effect further withdraws electron density through sigma bonds. Both effects significantly decrease basicity relative to aniline, making II the least basic.\n\nFor p-methylaniline (Compound III), the methyl group is a weak electron donor by $+I$ and hyperconjugation. At the para position, this increases electron density in the ring slightly, which in turn reduces the driving force for nitrogen lone-pair delocalization and modestly increases the availability of the lone pair for protonation. Thus III is slightly more basic than aniline.\n\nFor p-methoxyaniline (Compound IV), the methoxy group exerts a strong $+M$ (resonance donation) effect and a weaker $-I$ effect. At the para position, the $+M$ effect dominates, donating electron density into the ring and raising the electron density at the amino nitrogen indirectly, thereby decreasing the extent of lone-pair delocalization into the ring and increasing its availability for protonation. Consequently, IV is more basic than both aniline and p-methylaniline.\n\nCombining these effects gives the increasing basicity order:\n$$\\text{p-nitroaniline (II)} < \\text{aniline (I)} < \\text{p-methylaniline (III)} < \\text{p-methoxyaniline (IV)},$$\nwhich matches option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2205491"}, {"introduction": "While qualitative reasoning helps us rank compounds, quantitative analysis reveals the true magnitude of differences in their chemical properties.
