Two potential synthetic pathways are considered.\n\n**Route I:** Direct alkylation of ammonia. In this one-step process, benzyl bromide is treated with a large excess of ammonia ($\\text{NH}_3$).\n\n**Route II:** The Gabriel synthesis. This is a two-step process. First, benzyl bromide is reacted with potassium phthalimide. The resulting product is then treated with hydrazine ($\\text{N}_2\\text{H}_4$) in a subsequent workup step to liberate the amine.\n\nSelect the statement that best evaluates the suitability of these two routes for producing benzylamine in high purity.\n\nA. Route I is superior because ammonia is a simple, inexpensive reagent and the reaction is completed in a single step, making it more atom-economical.\nB. Route I is superior because benzyl bromide is a primary halide, which favors the $S_\\mathrm{N}2$ reaction with ammonia, leading to a clean, high-yield product.\nC. Route II is superior because the primary amine product formed in Route I is nucleophilic and can react further with benzyl bromide, leading to a mixture of polyalkylated products that are difficult to separate.\nD. Route II is superior because ammonia in Route I is a strong base that would cause benzyl bromide to undergo $E2$ elimination, yielding stilbene instead of the desired amine.\nE. Both routes are equally effective. Route I will produce an initial mixture, but the desired benzylamine can be easily isolated in high purity via fractional distillation.", "solution": "We aim to choose the route that yields benzylamine in high purity from benzyl bromide while accounting for mechanistic outcomes and separability of products.\n\nFundamental reactivity principles relevant here are:\n- Benzylic primary halides undergo $S_\\mathrm{N}2$ reactions readily due to resonance stabilization of the transition state.\n- Amine nucleophilicity increases with alkyl substitution due to inductive electron donation, so a primary amine is more nucleophilic than ammonia, and a secondary amine is more nucleophilic than a primary amine. Consequently, direct alkylation of ammonia tends to produce mixtures via overalkylation.\n- The Gabriel synthesis uses a masked amine nucleophile (phthalimide anion) that undergoes a single $S_\\mathrm{N}2$ alkylation; subsequent unmasking liberates only the primary amine, preventing overalkylation.\n\nAnalyze Route I (direct alkylation of ammonia). The initial $S_\\mathrm{N}2$ step gives an ammonium salt:\n$$\n\\mathrm{C_6H_5CH_2Br} + \\mathrm{NH_3} \\xrightarrow{S_\\mathrm{N}2} \\mathrm{C_6H_5CH_2NH_3^+Br^-}\n$$\nDeprotonation by excess $\\text{NH}_3$ affords the primary amine:\n$$\n\\mathrm{C_6H_5CH_2NH_3^+Br^-} + \\mathrm{NH_3} \\to \\mathrm{C_6H_5CH_2NH_2} + \\mathrm{NH_4^+Br^-}\n$$\nHowever, the primary amine product is more nucleophilic than $\\text{NH}_3$ and reacts further with benzyl bromide via $S_\\mathrm{N}2$, generating a secondary amine (again via an ammonium salt intermediate and deprotonation):\n$$\n\\mathrm{C_6H_5CH_2NH_2} + \\mathrm{C_6H_5CH_2Br} \\to (\\mathrm{C_6H_5CH_2})_2\\mathrm{NH} \\quad \\text{(after deprotonation)}\n$$\nFurther alkylation yields a tertiary amine and ultimately a quaternary ammonium salt:\n$$\n(\\mathrm{C_6H_5CH_2})_2\\mathrm{NH} + \\mathrm{C_6H_5CH_2Br} \\to (\\mathrm{C_6H_5CH_2})_3\\mathrm{N}\n$$\n$$\n(\\mathrm{C_6H_5CH_2})_3\\mathrm{N} + \\mathrm{C_6H_5CH_2Br} \\to (\\mathrm{C_6H_5CH_2})_4\\mathrm{N}^+\\mathrm{Br}^-\n$$\nThus Route I typically furnishes a mixture of primary, secondary, tertiary amines, and a quaternary ammonium salt. These species have similar physical properties (e.g., close boiling points for amines; the quaternary salt is nonvolatile), and hydrogen bonding plus salt formation complicates separations; fractional distillation does not readily provide high-purity benzylamine. While using a large excess of $\\text{NH}_3$ can suppress but not eliminate overalkylation, it does not reliably afford high purity.\n\nThe concern in option D about $E2$ elimination is unfounded in this context. With a primary benzylic halide and $\\text{NH}_3$ (a relatively weak base and better nucleophile), $S_\\mathrm{N}2$ dominates over $E2$. Moreover, benzyl bromide elimination would give styrene, not stilbene; formation of stilbene from benzyl bromide is not a correct outcome under these conditions.\n\nAnalyze Route II (Gabriel synthesis). Potassium phthalimide is a strong, ambident nucleophile at nitrogen that undergoes a single $S_\\mathrm{N}2$ substitution with the primary benzylic bromide:\n$$\n\\mathrm{C_6H_5CH_2Br} + (\\text{Phth})\\text{N}^-\\text{K}^+ \\xrightarrow{S_\\mathrm{N}2} \\mathrm{C_6H_5CH_2NPhth} + \\mathrm{KBr}\n$$\nwhere `NPhth` denotes the phthalimide residue bound to nitrogen. Subsequent hydrazinolysis cleaves the N–C bond to release only the primary amine:\n$$\n\\mathrm{C_6H_5CH_2NPhth} + \\mathrm{N_2H_4} \\to \\mathrm{C_6H_5CH_2NH_2} + \\text{phthalhydrazide}\n$$\nCrucially, the nitrogen in the phthalimide is not free to undergo multiple alkylations, so overalkylation is prevented, and the workup selectively liberates benzylamine. This route is therefore well suited for obtaining high-purity primary amine.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A is incorrect: although ammonia is simple and the step count is lower, direct alkylation produces mixtures that compromise purity; atom economy does not address purity.\n- B is incorrect: while the first substitution is fast and clean at a benzylic primary center, subsequent overalkylation degrades product purity.\n- C is correct: Route II avoids the overalkylation problem intrinsic to Route I and thus is superior for high-purity benzylamine.\n- D is incorrect: $S_\\mathrm{N}2$ dominates over $E2$ with $\\text{NH}_3$, and stilbene is not the elimination product from benzyl bromide.\n- E is incorrect: the mixture from Route I is not easily resolved by fractional distillation, especially in the presence of quaternary ammonium salts.\n\nTherefore, Route II is superior because Route I suffers from polyalkylation leading to difficult-to-separate mixtures, precisely as stated in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2207358"}, {"introduction": "Having established the advantages of the Gabriel synthesis, let's put it into practice.

The procedure starts with the reaction of potassium phthalimide with 1-bromo-2-methylpropane in dimethylformamide (DMF), a polar aprotic solvent.

Propan-1-amine (n-propylamine)", "solution": "The problem describes a two-step Gabriel synthesis of a primary amine. We must analyze both steps to determine the structure of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: N-Alkylation of Phthalimide**\n\nThe first step is the reaction between potassium phthalimide and 1-bromo-2-methylpropane. Potassium phthalimide serves as a source of the phthalimide anion. The nitrogen atom of the phthalimide anion is nucleophilic. The alkyl halide, 1-bromo-2-methylpropane, has the structure $(\\text{CH}_3)_2\\text{CHCH}_2\\text{Br}$. This is a primary alkyl halide, which is highly susceptible to $S_\\mathrm{N}2$ reactions.\n\nIn this $S_\\mathrm{N}2$ reaction, the nucleophilic nitrogen of the phthalimide anion attacks the carbon atom bonded to the bromine atom in 1-bromo-2-methylpropane. This attack displaces the bromide ion ($\\text{Br}^-$), forming a new carbon-nitrogen bond.\n\nThe structure of the reactant alkyl group is the 2-methylpropyl group, commonly known as the isobutyl group: $\\text{-}(\\text{CH}_2)\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_3)_2$.\nThe product of this first step is N-(2-methylpropyl)phthalimide. The chemical equation for this step is:\n$$ \\text{Phthalimide anion} + (\\text{CH}_3)_2\\text{CHCH}_2\\text{Br} \\longrightarrow \\text{N-(2-methylpropyl)phthalimide} + \\text{Br}^- $$\nThe key outcome of this step is that the alkyl group from the alkyl halide, the 2-methylpropyl group, is now attached to the nitrogen atom of the phthalimide structure.\n\n**Step 2: Hydrazinolysis of the N-Alkylphthalimide**\n\nThe second step involves treating the N-(2-methylpropyl)phthalimide intermediate with hydrazine ($\\text{H}_2\\text{NNH}_2$). This process, known as hydrazinolysis, is a method to cleave the N-alkylphthalimide and release the primary amine. Hydrazine acts as a strong nucleophile.\n\nThe mechanism involves a double nucleophilic acyl substitution. A nitrogen atom from hydrazine attacks one of the carbonyl carbons of the phthalimide ring, causing the C-N bond of the ring to break. An intramolecular reaction follows where the second nitrogen of the hydrazine moiety attacks the other carbonyl carbon. This process forms a stable, cyclic byproduct called phthalhydrazide and liberates the R-N portion of the intermediate. Since the nitrogen atom is protonated during the workup, the final product is the primary amine, $R\\text{-NH}_2$.\n\nIn this specific synthesis, the alkyl group (R) attached to the nitrogen is the 2-methylpropyl group. Therefore, the primary amine formed is 2-methylpropylamine.\n\n**Identifying the Final Product**\n\nThe structure of the amine product is $(\\text{CH}_3)_2\\text{CHCH}_2\\text{NH}_2$. To identify the correct option, we can determine its IUPAC and common names.\n\n*   **IUPAC Name**: The longest carbon chain containing the amino group (-NH2) has three carbons, so the parent alkane is propane, and the amine is a propanamine. The amino group is attached to carbon-1, making it propan-1-amine. There is a methyl group attached to carbon-2. Thus, the systematic IUPAC name is 2-methylpropan-1-amine.\n*   **Common Name**: The alkyl group $(\\text{CH}_3)_2\\text{CHCH}_2\\text{-}$ is the isobutyl group. Therefore, the common name of the amine is isobutylamine.\n\nNow, we compare this result with the given choices:\nA. Butan-1-amine (n-butylamine): $\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{NH}_2$. This has a straight four-carbon chain. Incorrect.\nB. Butan-2-amine (sec-butylamine): $\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}(\\text{NH}_2)\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3$. The amino group is on the second carbon of a straight four-carbon chain. Incorrect.\nC. 2-Methylpropan-1-amine (isobutylamine): $(\\text{CH}_3)_2\\text{CHCH}_2\\text{NH}_2$. This matches our derived structure and name. Correct.\nD. 2-Methylpropan-2-amine (tert-butylamine): $(\\text{CH}_3)_3\\text{CNH}_2$. The amino group is on a tertiary carbon. Incorrect.\nE. Propan-1-amine (n-propylamine): $\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{NH}_2$. This has only three carbons in total. Incorrect.\n\nThe correct product of the described Gabriel synthesis is 2-methylpropan-1-amine, also known as isobutylamine.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2207333"}, {"introduction": "A deep understanding of a reaction includes knowing its limitations. While the Gabriel synthesis is excellent for primary alkyl halides, can it be applied to other types of halides? This thought-provoking problem [@problem_id:2207349] asks you to evaluate the feasibility of using a vinylic halide, pushing you to connect the reaction's outcome with the fundamental principles of nucleophilic substitution mechanisms.", "problem": "A student proposes a multi-step synthesis to prepare vinylamine (ethenamine). The first step of the proposed route involves the reaction of vinyl chloride (chloroethene) with potassium phthalimide in a polar aprotic solvent, such as Dimethylformamide (DMF), with the intention of forming N-vinylphthalimide. This step is the crucial substitution part of a standard Gabriel synthesis. Evaluate the feasibility of this specific step. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate assessment and reasoning?\n\nA. The reaction will fail because vinyl halides are exceptionally unreactive towards nucleophilic substitution via an $S_\\mathrm{N}2$ mechanism due to the high energy required for a backside attack on an $sp^2$-hybridized carbon.\nB. The reaction will fail because the phthalimide anion is not a strong enough nucleophile to displace the chloride from the vinyl group.\nC. The reaction will proceed as planned, yielding N-vinylphthalimide, as the Gabriel synthesis is a general and effective method for converting halides to primary amines.\nD. The reaction will fail because vinyl chloride will preferentially undergo an $E2$ elimination reaction with the basic phthalimide anion, forming acetylene.\nE. The reaction will fail because it must proceed through an $S_\\mathrm{N}1$ mechanism, which requires the formation of a highly unstable vinylic carbocation intermediate.", "solution": "Identify the intended mechanism: In a Gabriel synthesis, the key step is a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution, denoted $S_\\mathrm{N}2$, of a halide by the phthalimide anion. This works well for primary $sp^3$ alkyl halides in polar aprotic solvents such as DMF, because such conditions favor $S_\\mathrm{N}2$.\n\nAnalyze the substrate: Vinyl chloride is a vinylic halide in which the leaving group is bonded to an $sp^2$-hybridized carbon. $S_\\mathrm{N}2$ at an $sp^2$ center is effectively forbidden. The required backside approach into $\\sigma^{*}_{\\mathrm{C\\text{-}Cl}}$ is blocked by the planar $sp^2$ geometry and the adjacent $\\pi$ system; formation of the pentacoordinate $S_\\mathrm{N}2$ transition state at a vinylic carbon is prohibitively high in energy. Consequently, even with a good nucleophile in a polar aprotic solvent, vinyl halides do not undergo $S_\\mathrm{N}2$.\n\nExclude alternative pathways and assess other statements:\n- Statement B is incorrect because the failure is not due to nucleophile strength; even very strong nucleophiles generally cannot displace a vinylic halide via $S_\\mathrm{N}2$. The fundamental issue is the $sp^2$ substrate.\n- Statement C is incorrect because the Gabriel synthesis is not general to vinylic (or aryl) halides; it is suited to primary $sp^3$ halides.\n- Statement D is incorrect because an $E2$ dehydrohalogenation of vinyl chloride to acetylene would require deprotonation of a vinylic C–H, which demands very strong base (e.g., alkynyl-forming conditions such as excess $\\text{NaNH}_2$). The phthalimide anion is a relatively weak base and would not effect this transformation under typical Gabriel conditions.\n- Statement E is incorrect in its premise: the reaction does not “have to” proceed by $S_\\mathrm{N}1$; the intended pathway is $S_\\mathrm{N}2$. While a vinylic carbocation would indeed be highly unstable (further disfavoring $S_\\mathrm{N}1$), this is not the operative reason the Gabriel step fails; it fails because $S_\\mathrm{N}2$ is not viable at a vinylic carbon.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate assessment is that the reaction fails because vinyl halides are exceptionally unreactive toward $S_\\mathrm{N}2$ due to the high energy required for backside attack on an $sp^2$-hybridized carbon.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2207349"}]}
