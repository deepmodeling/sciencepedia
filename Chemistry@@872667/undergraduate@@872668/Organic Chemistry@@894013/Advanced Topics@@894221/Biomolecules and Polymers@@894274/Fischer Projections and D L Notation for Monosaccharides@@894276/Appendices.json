This exercise focuses on decoding the name L-threose, which compactly encodes information about the carbon chain length, functional group, absolute configuration (L-series), and the relative arrangement of hydroxyl groups (threose). By working through this problem, you will practice converting these layers of nomenclature into a correct Fischer projection [@problem_id:2170597].", "problem": "Monosaccharides are classified based on several structural features, including the number of carbon atoms, the type of carbonyl group, and the stereochemistry of their chiral centers. An \"aldotetrose\" is a monosaccharide containing four carbon atoms and an aldehyde group. According to the Fischer projection convention, the carbon chain is drawn vertically with the most oxidized carbon (the aldehyde group, $C1$) at the top, and the other carbons ($C2, C3, C4$) numbered sequentially down the chain.\n\nThe D/L nomenclature system is used to specify the absolute configuration of the chiral center that is furthest from the carbonyl group. For an aldotetrose, this is the $C3$ carbon. In an L-sugar, the hydroxyl group on this highest-numbered chiral center is on the left side of the Fischer projection.\n\nThe name \"threose\" describes the relative stereochemistry of the two chiral centers ($C2$ and $C3$). In a threose isomer, the hydroxyl groups on $C2$ and $C3$ are on opposite sides of the carbon backbone in the Fischer projection. In contrast, for its diastereomer \"erythrose\", these hydroxyl groups are on the same side.\n\nGiven these definitions, determine the correct stereochemical arrangement for the sugar L-threose. Which of the following descriptions accurately represents the orientation of the hydroxyl groups in the Fischer projection of L-threose?\n\nA.

By definition, an aldotetrose has $C1$ as an aldehyde carbonyl at the top of the vertical Fischer projection, with the carbon chain running downward $C1$ to $C4$. The chiral centers in an aldotetrose are $C2$ and $C3$.\n\nAccording to the D/L convention, the designation is determined by the configuration at the highest-numbered chiral center, which is $C3$ for an aldotetrose. For an L-sugar, the hydroxyl group on this highest-numbered chiral center ($C3$) must be on the left in the Fischer projection.\n\nThe name \"threose\" specifies the relative stereochemistry of $C2$ and $C3$: their hydroxyl groups are on opposite sides in the Fischer projection. Therefore, once $C3$ is fixed on the left (to satisfy the L designation), the hydroxyl group on $C2$ must be on the right to satisfy the threose relationship (opposite sides).\n\nThus, for L-threose, the hydroxyl group on $C2$ is on the right, and the hydroxyl group on $C3$ is on the left.

This problem presents a thought experiment involving the well-known structure of D-glucose, challenging you to predict the stereochemical outcome of swapping its terminal functional groups. This practice is designed to solidify your understanding of how rotating a Fischer projection and re-assigning carbon numbers affects the molecule's D/L designation, revealing the deep connection between the 2D representation and the 3D molecule it represents [@problem_id:2170580].", "problem": "In carbohydrate chemistry, the D/L notation is used to specify the stereochemical configuration of a monosaccharide. This designation is determined by the orientation of the hydroxyl group on the highest-numbered chiral carbon in its Fischer projection. D-glucose is an aldohexose, and its structure can be represented by a Fischer projection where the carbons are numbered from the top aldehyde group ($C1$) to the bottom primary alcohol group ($C6$). The orientations of the hydroxyl (-OH) groups on the chiral centers of D-glucose are as follows: right on $C2$, left on $C3$, right on $C4$, and right on $C5$.\n\nConsider a hypothetical chemical transformation where the aldehyde group ($-CHO$) at the $C1$ position of D-glucose is interchanged with the primary alcohol group ($-CH_2OH$) at the $C6$ position, without altering the relative stereochemistry of the chiral carbons $C2, C3, C4, \\text{and } C5$. After this swap, the resulting molecule must be reoriented into a proper Fischer projection for a new aldose (i.e., with the aldehyde group at $C1$).\n\nWhat is the stereochemical configuration of this newly formed aldose?\n\nA. The new molecule is also a D-sugar.\n\nB. The new molecule is an L-sugar.\n\nC. The new molecule is achiral and thus has no D/L configuration.\n\nD. The operation results in D-glucose itself, so it remains a D-sugar.", "solution": "The problem asks for the D/L configuration of a new sugar formed by modifying D-glucose. To solve this, we must first visualize the Fischer projection of D-glucose, perform the described structural change, and then analyze the resulting molecule according to the conventions of Fischer projections.\n\nStep 1: Write the Fischer projection for D-glucose.\nThe problem states that D-glucose is an aldohexose. The aldehyde group ($-CHO$) is at $C1$ (top) and the primary alcohol group ($-CH_2OH$) is at $C6$ (bottom). The orientations of the -OH groups on the chiral carbons are given:\n- $C2$: -OH on the right\n- $C3$: -OH on the left\n- $C4$: -OH on the right\n- $C5$: -OH on the right\n\nThe Fischer projection for D-glucose is therefore:\n```\n      CHO\n      |\n  H - C - OH   (C2)\n      |\n HO - C - H    (C3)\n      |\n  H - C - OH   (C4)\n      |\n  H - C - OH   (C5)  -- Highest-numbered chiral carbon\n      |\n     CH2OH\n```\nAccording to the D/L naming convention, we look at the highest-numbered chiral carbon. In an aldohexose, this is $C5$. Since the -OH group on $C5$ is on the right, the molecule is designated as a D-sugar, hence D-glucose.\n\nStep 2: Perform the interchange of the top and bottom groups.\nThe problem instructs us to swap the $C1$ group ($-CHO$) with the $C6$ group ($-CH_2OH$). The stereochemistry of $C2, C3, C4, \\text{and } C5$ remains unchanged relative to the carbon chain.\n\nThe structure immediately after the swap is:\n```\n     CH2OH\n      |\n  H - C - OH   (C2 of original)\n      |\n HO - C - H    (C3 of original)\n      |\n  H - C - OH   (C4 of original)\n      |\n  H - C - OH   (C5 of original)\n      |\n      CHO      \n```\n\nStep 3: Reorient the molecule into a proper Fischer projection.\nBy convention, the Fischer projection of an aldose must have the most oxidized carbon, the aldehyde group ($-CHO$), at the top ($C1$ position). The current representation has it at the bottom. To correct this, we must rotate the entire molecule by 180 degrees in the plane of the paper. This is an allowed manipulation for a Fischer projection as it corresponds to an even number of interchanges (swapping top with bottom, and every left group with its corresponding right group) and thus preserves the molecule's absolute configuration.\n\nRotating the swapped structure 180 degrees results in:\n- The bottom $-CHO$ group moves to the top.\n- The top $-CH_2OH$ group moves to the bottom.\n- All groups on the left side of the chiral carbons move to the right side.\n- All groups on the right side of the chiral carbons move to the left side.\n\nLet's apply this transformation. The new carbon numbering will be from the top down.\n- Original $C5$ becomes new $C2$: The -OH was on the right, so it moves to the left.\n- Original $C4$ becomes new $C3$: The -OH was on the right, so it moves to the left.\n- Original $C3$ becomes new $C4$: The -OH was on the left, so it moves to the right.\n- Original $C2$ becomes new $C5$: The -OH was on the right, so it moves to the left.\n\nThe resulting correct Fischer projection for the new aldose is:\n```\n      CHO      (new C1)\n      |\n HO - C - H    (new C2)\n      |\n HO - C - H    (new C3)\n      |\n  H - C - OH   (new C4)\n      |\n HO - C - H    (new C5)  -- Highest-numbered chiral carbon\n      |\n     CH2OH     (new C6)\n```\n\nStep 4: Determine the D/L configuration of the new molecule.\nWe now apply the D/L naming rule to this newly formed aldose. We examine the highest-numbered chiral carbon, which is now $C5$. In the final Fischer projection, the hydroxyl (-OH) group on $C5$ is on the **left**.\n\nTherefore, the new molecule is an L-sugar. This specific sugar is known as L-idose.\n\nComparing this conclusion with the given options:\nA. The new molecule is also a D-sugar. (Incorrect)\nB. The new molecule is an L-sugar. (Correct)\nC. The new molecule is achiral and thus has no D/L configuration. (Incorrect, it has chiral centers)\nD. The operation results in D-glucose itself, so it remains a D-sugar.
