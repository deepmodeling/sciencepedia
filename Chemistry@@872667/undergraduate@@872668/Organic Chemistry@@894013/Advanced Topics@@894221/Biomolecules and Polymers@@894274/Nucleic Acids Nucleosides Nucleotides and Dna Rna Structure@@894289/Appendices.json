This first exercise invites you to apply fundamental principles of stereochemistry to 2'-deoxyguanosine, a key building block of DNA. By identifying the chiral carbons within this nucleoside, you'll reinforce your ability to spot stereocenters in complex organic structures and appreciate how molecular chirality underpins the helical nature of DNA [@problem_id:2185456].", "problem": "A chiral carbon atom, or stereocenter, is a carbon atom that is attached to four different groups. These molecules are fundamental building blocks in biochemistry. Consider the structure of 2'-deoxyguanosine, a nucleoside found in Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA). It is formed by the attachment of the purine base guanine to the 1' carbon of a 2-deoxyribose sugar molecule. Determine the total number of chiral carbon atoms present in a single molecule of 2'-deoxyguanosine.\n\nSelect your answer from the options below:\nA. 2\nB. 3\nC. 4\nD. 5\nE. 6", "solution": "A chiral carbon (stereocenter) is a carbon atom that is tetrahedral and bonded to four different substituents.\n\n2'-deoxyguanosine consists of a guanine base attached to a 2-deoxyribofuranose sugar at the anomeric (1') carbon via an N-glycosidic bond to N9 of guanine.\n\nFirst, assess the guanine base: all ring carbons are part of an aromatic, planar purine system with sp2 hybridization, and there are no sp3 carbons bearing four different substituents. Therefore, guanine contributes zero chiral carbons.\n\nNext, assess the 2-deoxyribofuranose sugar carbons:\n- C1' is sp3 and bonded to N9 of guanine, O4' (ring oxygen), C2', and H. These four substituents are all different, so C1' is chiral.\n- C2' in 2'-deoxy form bears two hydrogens and is bonded to C1' and C3'; with two identical hydrogens, it is not chiral.\n- C3' is bonded to C2', C4', OH, and H; these are four different substituents, so C3' is chiral.\n- C4' is bonded to C3', O4' (ring oxygen), C5', and H; these are four different substituents, so C4' is chiral.\n- C5' is a CH2 group (CH2OH) with two hydrogens and thus is not chiral.\n\nSumming the chiral carbons: C1', C3', and C4' are chiral, giving a total of 3 chiral carbon atoms in 2'-deoxyguanosine.

This practice focuses on the two foundational rules governing DNA structure: the specific hydrogen-bonding between base pairs (A with T, G with C) and the antiparallel arrangement of the two strands. Constructing the complementary strand for a given DNA sequence is a critical skill that forms the basis for understanding DNA replication, transcription, and numerous laboratory techniques like PCR [@problem_id:2185510].", "problem": "In the study of molecular biology, the structure of Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is fundamental. A DNA molecule is a double helix composed of two polynucleotide chains that are complementary to each other. The building blocks of these chains are nucleotides, each containing one of four nitrogenous bases: Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C), and Thymine (T). The complementarity is governed by specific base-pairing rules: Adenine pairs with Thymine, and Guanine pairs with Cytosine. Furthermore, the two strands are antiparallel, meaning they run in opposite directions. The orientation of a strand is indicated by its 5' (five prime) and 3' (three prime) ends.\n\nConsider a short, single-stranded DNA sequence that is a fragment of a gene's coding region, given as:\n`5'-ATGCAG-3'`\n\nWhich of the following options correctly represents the sequence and orientation of the complementary DNA strand?\n\nA. 3'-UACGUC-5'\nB. 5'-TACGTC-3'\nC. 3'-TACGTC-5'\nD. 3'-GCATGA-5'\nE. 5'-GCATGA-3'", "solution": "We use the DNA base-pairing rules (A pairs with T, and G pairs with C) and the fact that the two strands are antiparallel, meaning the complementary strand runs in the opposite orientation: the $5'$ end of one strand aligns with the $3'$ end of the other.\n\nStarting from the given strand 5'-ATGCAG-3', we determine the complementary bases for each position:\nA pairs with T, T pairs with A, G pairs with C, C pairs with G, A pairs with T, and G pairs with C. This yields the complementary sequence of bases TACGTC.\n\nBecause the strands are antiparallel, the complementary strand must be written from its $3'$ end opposite the given strand’s $5'$ end. Therefore, the correct complementary strand with proper orientation is 3'-TACGTC-5'.\n\nOption A is invalid because it uses U (uracil), which is found in RNA, not DNA. Option B presents the correct base sequence but in the wrong (parallel) orientation. Options D and E have incorrect base sequences. Hence, the correct choice is the one that shows 3'-TACGTC-5', which is option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2185510"}, {"introduction": "The Watson-Crick model describes an ideal DNA structure, but real biological systems often contain imperfections. This final practice challenges you to think like a biophysicist by evaluating the stability of DNA duplexes containing mismatched base pairs. By comparing the effects of a G-T \"wobble\" pair versus an A-C mismatch on the DNA melting temperature ($T_m$), you will integrate your knowledge of hydrogen bonding, base geometry, and chemical equilibrium to predict the physical properties of DNA [@problem_id:2185466]. This problem highlights how subtle molecular differences have measurable consequences for the stability of the double helix.", "problem": "Two synthetic Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) oligomers are prepared for a biophysical experiment. Both are designed to form 25-base-pair duplexes and have an identical overall base composition, with 12 G-C pairs and 13 A-T pairs if they were to form perfect helices. However, due to synthesis errors, each duplex contains a single mismatched base pair at the same central position.\n\n- **Duplex I** contains a single guanine-thymine (G-T) mismatch.\n- **Duplex II** contains a single adenine-cytosine (A-C) mismatch.\n\nAll other base pairs in both duplexes are the standard Watson-Crick pairs. The melting temperature ($T_m$) is defined as the temperature at which half of the DNA duplexes dissociate into single strands. Assuming the experiment is conducted at a physiological pH of 7.4, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the relative thermal stability of the two duplexes?\n\nA. Duplex I will have a higher $T_m$ because the G-T \"wobble\" pair can form two stable hydrogen bonds, preserving helical structure more effectively than the A-C mismatch, which has poor geometric and electronic complementarity for hydrogen bonding.\nB. Duplex II will have a higher $T_m$ because the A-C pair is sterically smaller than the G-T pair, leading to less local distortion of the double helix.\nC. Both duplexes will have nearly identical $T_m$ values because the overall GC-content and duplex length are identical, and any single mismatch contributes a similar, fixed energetic penalty to destabilization.\nD. Duplex II will have a higher $T_m$ because the A-C mismatch can become protonated at physiological pH to form a stable pair with two hydrogen bonds, which is energetically superior to the G-T pair.\nE. Duplex I will have a higher $T_m$ because the G-T pair is an isosteric replacement for a G-C pair, causing zero distortion in the helix backbone.", "solution": "The thermal stability of a DNA duplex at its melting temperature is governed by the condition of two-state equilibrium, where half of the duplexes are dissociated. Thermodynamically, at $T_m$ the standard free energy change is zero, so\n$$\n\\Delta G(T_m)=\\Delta H-T_m\\Delta S=0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad T_m=\\frac{\\Delta H}{\\Delta S}.\n$$\nA single mismatch perturbs both $\\Delta H$ (through hydrogen bonding and base stacking) and $\\Delta S$ (through altered conformational freedom and hydration), but the dominant effect is typically enthalpic due to changes in hydrogen bonding and stacking.\n\nCompare the two mismatches at physiological pH 7.4:\n\n1) G-T mismatch. Guanine and thymine can form a canonical wobble pair with two hydrogen bonds in a geometry that, while not perfectly isosteric with a Watson-Crick pair, preserves much of the helical structure and stacking. This maintains a relatively favorable (more negative) $\\Delta H$ and modestly perturbs $\\Delta S$, yielding a comparatively higher $T_m$.\n\n2) A-C mismatch. Adenine and cytosine do not form a stable, well-matched hydrogen-bonding pattern at neutral pH. A more stable A-C$^+$ pair can form only upon protonation, but the protonation state at pH 7.4 is unfavorable. By the Henderson-Hasselbalch relation,\n$$\n\\text{pH}=\\text{p}K_\\text{a}+\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}\\right),\n$$\nand the fraction protonated is\n$$\nf=\\frac{1}{1+10^{\\text{pH}-\\text{p}K_\\text{a}}}.\n$$\nFor protonatable sites relevant to A or C in base pairing, the $\\text{p}K_\\text{a}$ is well below 7, so $10^{\\text{pH}-\\text{p}K_\\text{a}} \\gg 1$ at pH 7.4, implying $f \\approx 0$. Thus, the A-C pair remains largely unprotonated, offering poor hydrogen bonding and worse geometric/electronic complementarity, which reduces the magnitude of $\\Delta H$ (less favorable) and increases local distortion, thereby lowering the $T_m$ relative to the G-T wobble.\n\nEvaluation of the statements:\n- A is correct: the G-T wobble forms two hydrogen bonds and preserves helical structure better than an unprotonated A-C mismatch, leading to a higher $T_m$ for Duplex I.\n- B is incorrect: steric size alone does not confer higher stability; the A-C mismatch lacks favorable hydrogen bonding and proper geometry at neutral pH.\n- C is incorrect: mismatch identity strongly affects the energetic penalty; identical GC-content and length do not equalize $T_m$.\n- D is incorrect: at pH 7.4, protonation needed for stabilizing the A-C$^+$ pair is negligible.\n- E is incorrect: G-T wobble is not an isosteric replacement for G-C and does introduce some distortion.\n\nTherefore, Duplex I will have the higher $T_m$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2185466"}]}
