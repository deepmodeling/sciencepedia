It is formed by the condensation of two D-glucose monosaccharide units. Given that both glucose units exist in their pyranose (six-membered ring) form, and that the linkage is specifically a $\\beta(1\\to4)$ glycosidic bond, which of the following statements provides the most accurate and complete chemical description of the cellobiose molecule?\n\nA. The anomeric carbon (C1) of one D-glucose unit is bonded to the oxygen of the hydroxyl group at the C4 position of a second D-glucose unit. The stereochemistry of this glycosidic linkage is beta, meaning the oxygen atom of the bond is in an equatorial position with respect to the first glucose ring.\n\nB. The anomeric carbon (C1) of one D-glucose unit is bonded to the oxygen of the hydroxyl group at the C4 position of a second D-glucose unit. The stereochemistry of this glycosidic linkage is alpha, meaning the oxygen atom of the bond is in an axial position with respect to the first glucose ring.\n\nC. The anomeric carbon (C1) of one D-glucose unit is bonded to the oxygen of the hydroxyl group at the C6 position of a second D-glucose unit. The stereochemistry of this glycosidic linkage is beta, meaning the oxygen atom of the bond is in an equatorial position with respect to the first glucose ring.\n\nD. The anomeric carbon (C1) of a D-glucose unit is bonded to the anomeric carbon (C2) of a D-fructose unit. This forms a linkage between the two rings that involves both anomeric carbons.\n\nE. The anomeric carbon (C1) of a D-galactose unit is bonded to the oxygen of the hydroxyl group at the C4 position of a D-glucose unit. The stereochemistry of this glycosidic linkage is beta.", "solution": "We first recall the nomenclature and structural principles for disaccharide glycosidic linkages:\n- The term $\\beta(1\\to4)$ specifies that the glycosidic bond is formed from the anomeric carbon at C1 of the first sugar to the oxygen of the hydroxyl group attached to C4 of the second sugar, with the configuration at the anomeric center of the first sugar being $\\beta$.\n- The $\\beta$ designation refers to the configuration at the anomeric carbon of the donor monosaccharide: for D-glucopyranose in the standard ${}^{4}C_{1}$ chair, the $\\beta$ substituent at C1 is equatorial. Thus, a $\\beta$-glycosidic bond from D-glucose implies that the glycosidic oxygen attached at C1 is equatorial with respect to the first glucose ring.\n- In cellobiose, both units are D-glucopyranose, and the linkage is specifically $\\beta(1\\to4)$, so the anomeric carbon C1 of one D-glucose is bonded via oxygen to the hydroxyl on C4 of the second D-glucose. The second glucose’s anomeric carbon remains free (reducing end), consistent with cellulose repeating units.\n\nNow evaluate each option against these criteria:\n- Option A: States that C1 of one D-glucose is bonded to the oxygen of the hydroxyl at C4 of a second D-glucose, and that the stereochemistry is $\\beta$ with the glycosidic oxygen equatorial relative to the first glucose. This exactly matches the definition and conformational implication for D-glucopyranose in a $\\beta(1\\to4)$ linkage. This is correct.\n- Option B: Identical connectivity but specifies $\\alpha$ (axial) stereochemistry. This contradicts the known $\\beta(1\\to4)$ linkage of cellobiose; incorrect.\n- Option C: Specifies a $(1\\to6)$ linkage. Cellobiose is $(1\\to4)$; incorrect.\n- Option D: Describes a glucose-fructose disaccharide linked via two anomeric carbons, characteristic of sucrose, not cellobiose; incorrect.\n- Option E: Describes a $\\beta(1\\to4)$ linkage between D-galactose and D-glucose, which is lactose, not cellobiose; incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and complete description is given in Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2205734"}, {"introduction": "Beyond identifying linkages, a crucial aspect of carbohydrate chemistry is classifying sugars based on their reactivity, particularly as 'reducing' or 'non-reducing'. This classification depends entirely on the presence of a free hemiacetal group, which allows the sugar to open into its aldehyde form. This exercise [@problem_id:2205741] challenges you to apply this principle to a novel disaccharide, forcing you to think critically about which structural features determine its chemical properties.", "problem": "In a biochemical synthesis experiment, a research team creates a novel disaccharide by enzymatically connecting two different monosaccharides: D-galactose and D-ribose. The linkage is formed specifically between the anomeric carbon (C1) of the D-galactose unit and the hydroxyl group on carbon 5 (C5) of the D-ribose unit. A carbohydrate is classified as a \"reducing sugar\" if its molecular structure includes a hemiacetal group, which can exist in equilibrium with an open-chain form that contains an aldehyde functional group.\n\nBased on the described $(1\\to5)$ linkage, which of the following statements provides the correct classification for this new disaccharide?\n\nA. The disaccharide is a non-reducing sugar.\n\nB. The disaccharide is a reducing sugar.\n\nC. The classification as reducing or non-reducing depends on whether the glycosidic linkage has an $\\alpha$ or $\\beta$ configuration.\n\nD. A stable disaccharide cannot be formed with this linkage, so it has no classification.\n\nE. The disaccharide will exist as a zwitterion, which is neither reducing nor non-reducing.", "solution": "A carbohydrate is a reducing sugar if its structure contains a free hemiacetal at an anomeric carbon that can equilibrate with an open-chain form containing an aldehyde. For aldoses, the anomeric carbon is $C_{1}$. Formation of a glycosidic bond at an anomeric carbon converts the hemiacetal into an acetal, which is not in equilibrium with an open-chain aldehyde; thus that end becomes non-reducing. In a disaccharide, if both anomeric carbons are tied up as acetals, the sugar is non-reducing; if at least one anomeric carbon remains as a hemiacetal, the sugar is reducing.\n\nIn the described disaccharide, the linkage is $(1\\to5)$ from the anomeric carbon $C_{1}$ of D-galactose to the hydroxyl on $C_{5}$ of D-ribose. This linkage renders the galactose $C_{1}$ an acetal (non-reducing end). However, for D-ribose (an aldopentose), the anomeric carbon is $C_{1}$, and it is not involved in the glycosidic bond because the bond uses the $C_{5}$ hydroxyl. Therefore the ribose $C_{1}$ remains a free hemiacetal and can equilibrate with its open-chain aldehyde form. Even though the $C_{5}$ hydroxyl is involved in the linkage (precluding ribopyranose formation via $C_{5}$), ribose can still adopt a furanose form via the $C_{4}$ hydroxyl; in any case, the key point is that $C_{1}$ of ribose remains free and reducing.\n\nHence, the disaccharide retains one free anomeric carbon and is a reducing sugar. This classification does not depend on the $\\alpha$ or $\\beta$ configuration of the glycosidic bond, and a $(1\\to5)$ glycosidic linkage is chemically feasible. Therefore, the correct choice is that the disaccharide is a reducing sugar.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2205741"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice problem elevates the challenge from analyzing given structures to deducing a structure from experimental evidence, a task common in biochemical research. You are presented with a set of properties for an unknown trisaccharide derived from the partial hydrolysis of amylose. This puzzle [@problem_id:2205748] requires you to integrate your knowledge of polysaccharide structure, hydrolysis reactions, and the chemical basis for a non-reducing sugar to propose the most plausible molecular architecture.", "problem": "A biochemist is studying the products of carbohydrate degradation. A sample of pure amylose, which is a linear polysaccharide composed entirely of D-glucopyranose units joined by $\\alpha(1\\to4)$-glycosidic bonds, is subjected to partial acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. The resulting mixture of oligosaccharides is carefully separated using chromatography. One of the isolated fractions is identified as a pure, unbranched trisaccharide. Further analysis of this trisaccharide with Fehling's reagent yields a negative result, indicating that it is a non-reducing sugar.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following descriptions most plausibly represents the structure of this non-reducing trisaccharide? For the purpose of these options, the abbreviation 'Glc' represents a D-glucopyranose unit.\n\nA. Three Glc units are connected in series. The anomeric carbon of the first unit is linked to the C4 hydroxyl of the second unit. The anomeric carbon of the second unit is then linked to the anomeric carbon of the third unit, forming a terminal trehalose-like moiety.\n\nB. Three Glc units are connected in a linear chain by two successive $\\alpha(1\\to4)$ glycosidic bonds.\n\nC. Two Glc units are linked by an $\\alpha(1\\to4)$ bond, and a third Glc unit is attached as a branch to the C6 hydroxyl of the central glucose unit.\n\nD. Three Glc units are linked head-to-tail by three successive $\\alpha(1\\to4)$ glycosidic bonds to form a small, cyclic structure.", "solution": "We start from the definition of the substrate and the test outcome. Amylose is a linear homopolymer of D-glucopyranose units joined by $\\alpha(1\\to4)$ glycosidic bonds. Partial acid-catalyzed hydrolysis cleaves some of these bonds to give oligosaccharides; such hydrolysis by itself does not introduce branching and preserves the $\\alpha(1\\to4)$ connectivity in any intact linkage. A carbohydrate is reducing if it contains at least one residue with a free anomeric carbon (a hemiacetal) that can undergo ring opening to an aldehyde and reduce Fehling's reagent; conversely, it is non-reducing if all anomeric carbons are engaged in acetal (glycosidic) linkages so that no free anomeric carbon remains.\n\nFor a trisaccharide ($n=3$), there are three anomeric carbons. To be non-reducing, the count of free anomeric carbons must be zero; that is, each anomeric carbon must be involved in a glycosidic (acetal) bond.\n\nEvaluate each option against these criteria and the constraints “pure, unbranched trisaccharide” and “most plausible from partial hydrolysis of amylose”:\n\nOption B describes a linear chain with two successive $\\alpha(1\\to4)$ bonds, i.e., maltotriose. In such a linear maltooligosaccharide, one terminus is the reducing end with a free anomeric carbon, so it would give a positive Fehling’s test. Therefore it contradicts the observed non-reducing behavior and is excluded.\n\nOption C introduces a branch at C6 of the central unit. This contradicts the explicit “unbranched” description. Moreover, such a structure would still leave at least one terminal free anomeric carbon, making it a reducing sugar. Hence it is excluded.\n\nOption D proposes a cyclic trimer formed by three successive $\\alpha(1\\to4)$ linkages, which would indeed be non-reducing because each anomeric carbon would be acetalized in the cycle. However, formation of a three-unit $\\alpha(1\\to4)$ macrocycle is chemically implausible: known cyclodextrins formed from $\\alpha(1\\to4)$ linkages require at least six units, and acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of amylose does not produce such small cyclic oligosaccharides. Thus, despite being non-reducing in principle, this is not a plausible product under the stated conditions.\n\nOption A describes an unbranched trisaccharide where the first two units are connected by an $\\alpha(1\\to4)$ linkage (consistent with amylose’s native connectivity), and the second and third units are linked anomeric-to-anomeric (a trehalose-like $1\\leftrightarrow 1$ acetal). In this arrangement, the anomeric carbon of the first unit is involved in the $\\alpha(1\\to4)$ bond, and both anomeric carbons of the second and third units are tied up in the $1\\leftrightarrow 1$ linkage; thus no free anomeric carbon remains, and the trisaccharide is non-reducing. The structure is unbranched and, among the given choices, is the most plausible representation consistent with an amylose-derived backbone and the observed negative Fehling’s test.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible description is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2205748"}]}
