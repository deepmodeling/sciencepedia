However, the nature of the amino acid side chains plays a critical role in determining whether a particular secondary structure is favored or forbidden. This conceptual problem explores why a chain of identical residues, poly-L-lysine, is unstable as an $\\alpha$-helix at neutral pH, highlighting how electrostatic forces between side chains can override the stabilizing forces of the backbone [@problem_id:2192844].", "problem": "A polypeptide chain composed entirely of L-lysine residues, known as poly-L-lysine, is synthesized for a biophysical study. The structure of this polypeptide is analyzed in a buffered solution at a constant pH of 7.0. The side chain of lysine contains an amino group with a pKa of approximately 10.5. Based on the fundamental principles of protein secondary structure, which of the following statements provides the most accurate explanation for why poly-L-lysine is unlikely to form a stable $\\alpha$-helix under these conditions?\n\nA. The bulky and flexible side chains of the lysine residues create significant steric hindrance, preventing the polypeptide backbone from coiling into the compact helical conformation.\nB. The side-chain amino groups preferentially form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, which energetically outcompete the intramolecular hydrogen bonds required to stabilize the $\\alpha$-helix.\nC. At pH 7.0, the side-chain amino groups are protonated, resulting in a high density of positive charges along the chain that cause strong electrostatic repulsion, destabilizing the helical structure.\nD. The lysine side chain forces a rigid bend in the polypeptide backbone, similar to the effect of a proline residue, making it a natural \"helix breaker\".\nE. At pH 7.0, the backbone amide hydrogens become sufficiently acidic to be removed by the buffer, eliminating the hydrogen bond donors necessary for $\\alpha$-helix formation.", "solution": "We analyze the ionization state of lysine side chains and the energetic consequences for the $\\alpha$-helix.\n\nFirst, determine the protonation state of the lysine $\\varepsilon$-amino group using the Henderson–Hasselbalch relation for a base $B$ and its conjugate acid $BH^{+}$:\n$$\npH = pK_{a} + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[B]}{[BH^{+}]}\\right).\n$$\nRearranging gives\n$$\n\\frac{[B]}{[BH^{+}]} = 10^{pH - pK_{a}}.\n$$\nWhen $pH < pK_{a}$, we have $10^{pH - pK_{a}} < 1$, so $[BH^{+}] \\gg [B]$. Therefore, at $pH = 7.0$ with $pK_{a}$ of the side-chain amino group around $10.5$, the side chains are overwhelmingly protonated and carry positive charge $q = +e$.\n\nSecond, consider the energetic implications for an $\\alpha$-helix. An $\\alpha$-helix is stabilized primarily by backbone intramolecular hydrogen bonds between residue $i$ carbonyl oxygens and residue $i+4$ amide hydrogens. However, in poly-L-lysine at $pH = 7.0$, there is a high linear density of positive charges on the side chains. The pairwise electrostatic interaction between two like charges $q_{i}$ and $q_{j}$ separated by a distance $r_{ij}$ in a medium of relative permittivity $\\varepsilon_{r}$ is given by Coulomb’s law:\n$$\nU_{ij} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} \\varepsilon_{r}} \\frac{q_{i} q_{j}}{r_{ij}}.\n$$\nWith $q_{i} = q_{j} = +e$, $U_{ij} > 0$ (repulsive). Summing over many neighboring side chains along the helical geometry yields a positive electrostatic contribution $\\Delta G_{\\text{elec}} > 0$ that raises the free energy of the helical state relative to conformations that allow greater charge separation and solvent screening. If the total repulsive electrostatic contribution exceeds the stabilizing backbone hydrogen-bond contribution, symbolically $\\sum U_{ij}^{\\text{rep}} > |\\sum U_{\\text{HB}}|$, the helix is destabilized.\n\nThird, evaluate the alternatives:\n- A is not the dominant factor: lysine, while flexible and somewhat bulky, has a reasonable helix propensity, and steric hindrance alone does not preclude helices.\n- B is not the primary mechanism: $\\alpha$-helix stabilization arises from backbone hydrogen bonds; side-chain hydrogen bonding to water does not directly disrupt the $i \\rightarrow i+4$ backbone hydrogen bonds in the way that pervasive like-charge repulsion does.\n- D is incorrect: lysine does not impose the rigid $\\phi$ constraint or lack an amide hydrogen like proline; thus it is not a canonical helix breaker.\n- E is incorrect: backbone amide hydrogens do not deprotonate at $pH = 7.0$; their acidity is far too weak, so backbone hydrogen-bond donors remain available.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate explanation is that at $pH = 7.0$ the protonated lysine side chains create strong intrachain electrostatic repulsion that destabilizes the $\\alpha$-helix.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2192844"}, {"introduction": "Many proteins achieve their final, functional form by assembling multiple polypeptide chains, or subunits, into a multi-component quaternary structure. Determining this complete architecture requires integrating data from several biochemical techniques. In this practice, you will step into the role of a biochemist to decipher a protein's quaternary structure by interpreting a set of experimental results from gel filtration and SDS-PAGE, learning how to connect data on native mass, subunit composition, and disulfide linkages to build a complete molecular model [@problem_id:2192802].", "problem": "An uncharacterized protein, which we will call \"nectarin,\" is isolated from a novel species of nectar-feeding bat. Its structure is investigated using a combination of biochemical techniques.

This experiment results in two distinct bands on the gel, one corresponding to a molecular weight of 60 kDa and the other to 40 kDa.\n\nBased on these experimental results, determine which of the following statements provides the most accurate and complete description of the quaternary structure of the native nectarin protein.\n\nA. The protein is a homodimer composed of two identical 100 kDa polypeptide chains associated via non-covalent interactions.\nB. The protein is a heterotetramer composed of two 60 kDa subunits and two 40 kDa subunits, all of which are associated with each other solely through non-covalent interactions.\nC.

Since SDS denaturation removes noncovalent interactions, the persistence of a $100\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ species indicates that within the native complex there exists at least one covalently (disulfide) linked unit of mass $100\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ that does not dissociate without reduction. Therefore, there is a disulfide-linked subassembly of mass $100\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$.\n\nIn SDS-PAGE with BME, two bands at $60\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ and $40\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ appear. The only change from the nonreducing condition is the reduction of disulfide bonds; therefore, the $100\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ disulfide-linked unit must be composed of one $60\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ polypeptide and one $40\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ polypeptide linked by at least one disulfide bond.

Thus, the native quaternary structure is a heterotetramer best described as a dimer of dimers: each dimer is a $60\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ chain covalently (disulfide) linked to a $40\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ chain, and two such dimers associate noncovalently to form the $200\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ native protein.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incompatible with the reducing SDS-PAGE, which reveals non-identical chains of $60$ and $40\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ rather than identical $100\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ chains.\n- B is incompatible with the nonreducing SDS-PAGE, which shows a $100\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ band, indicating disulfide linkage; if only noncovalent interactions were present, one would observe $60$ and $40\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ bands without reduction.\n- C matches the disulfide-linked $100\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ heterodimer but fails to account for the native $200\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ mass.\n- D predicts disulfide-linked $60$-$60$ and $40$-$40$ dimers, which would appear near $120$ and $80\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ under nonreducing SDS-PAGE, not the observed single $100\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ band.\n- E matches all observations: a $200\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ native mass composed of two $100\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ disulfide-linked $60$-$40$ heterodimers associated noncovalently.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and complete description is a heterotetramer that is a dimer of disulfide-linked $60\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$-$40\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ heterodimers.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2192802"}]}
