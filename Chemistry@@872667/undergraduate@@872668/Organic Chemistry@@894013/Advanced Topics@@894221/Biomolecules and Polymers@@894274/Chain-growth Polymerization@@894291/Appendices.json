The monomer is 3-methyl-1-butene, written as CH2=CH-CH(CH3)2. Label the double-bond carbons as C1 (CH2) and C2 (CH), and the adjacent carbon as C3, which bears two methyl groups.\n\nInitiation: In strongly acidic cationic polymerization, protonation occurs to give the more stable carbocation. Protonation at C1 (the terminal carbon) produces a carbocation at C2. At this stage the carbocation at C2 is secondary because C2 is bonded to C1 and C3 (two carbons) and one hydrogen.\n\nCarbocation rearrangement: A rapid and thermodynamically favorable 1,2-hydride shift from C3 to the adjacent carbocation center at C2 occurs, moving the positive charge from C2 to C3. The resulting carbocation at C3 is tertiary because it is bonded to three carbons (two methyl groups and C2). This tertiary carbocation is significantly more stable than the initial secondary carbocation.\n\nPropagation: The tertiary carbocation at C3 reacts with the terminal carbon (C1′, a CH2) of a new monomer unit. The double bond donates electron density to the carbocation, forming a new C–C bond between the chain-end tertiary center (C3) and the monomer’s terminal CH2 (C1′). This produces a new secondary carbocation at the internal carbon of the incoming monomer (C2′).\n\nRearrangement after each addition: The newly formed secondary carbocation at C2′ again undergoes a 1,2-hydride shift from its adjacent tertiary carbon (C3′, bearing two methyl groups), transferring the positive charge to C3′ and regenerating a tertiary carbocation at the chain end.\n\nIterating this sequence shows the repeating connectivity along the backbone as follows:\n- The chain alternates through a quaternary carbon (the former C3 position bearing two methyl substituents and two chain bonds) followed by two methylene carbons (the former C1 and then the former C2 after hydride shift).\n- Thus, between successive quaternary centers there are two methylene units.\n\nTherefore, the structural motif that repeats along the polymer backbone is a quaternary carbon bearing two methyl groups followed by two methylenes, i.e., [-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2-], which corresponds to option D. This reflects the head-to-tail addition with obligatory hydride shift after each insertion, locking the tertiary carbocation at the C3 position for the next propagation step and yielding two methylenes between adjacent quaternary centers.\n\nHence, the correct repeating unit in the major polymer product is option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2158864"}, {"introduction": "The true power of modern polymer chemistry lies in our ability to design and synthesize materials with precisely controlled architectures and properties. This final challenge moves from analyzing a single polymerization type to strategically designing a multi-step synthesis for a complex triblock terpolymer. Successfully solving this problem requires integrating knowledge of several distinct polymerization mechanisms—including ring-opening, controlled radical, and cationic polymerization—and planning the chemical transformations needed to switch from one mechanism to the next, culminating in a sophisticated macromolecular structure.

The synthesis must be designed to proceed in three major stages, corresponding to the sequential growth of each block. Achieving a well-defined final product with good control over molecular weight and low dispersity requires careful selection of polymerization mechanisms and the design of specific chemical transformations to switch between them.\n\nThe proposed three-stage synthesis is as follows:\n1.  **Stage 1: PCL Synthesis.** Synthesis of the first block, PCL, from the $\\epsilon$-caprolactone monomer, resulting in a polymer terminated with a reactive functional group.\n2.  **Stage 2: PS Synthesis.** Use of the PCL-based macroinitiator from Stage 1 to polymerize styrene, forming a diblock copolymer that is itself terminated with a new reactive functional group.\n3.  **Stage 3: PIB Synthesis.** Use of the PCL-PS diblock macroinitiator from Stage 2 to polymerize isobutylene, yielding the final PCL-PS-PIB triblock terpolymer.\n\nConsider the following options, each proposing a set of reagents for three critical steps in this synthesis:\n- **Step 1a:** The initiator used to begin the polymerization of $\\epsilon$-caprolactone.\n- **Step 2a:** The key reagent used to transform the terminus of the PCL block into an active initiating site for the controlled polymerization of the subsequent styrene block. This transformation may occur as a termination step for Stage 1.\n- **Step 3a:** The key reagent system used to transform the terminus of the PCL-PS block into an active initiating site for the polymerization of the final isobutylene block.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly identifies a synthetically viable and mechanistically sound set of reagents for steps 1a, 2a, and 3a, respectively?\n\nA. \n- **1a:** n-Butyllithium\n- **2a:** Ethylene oxide, followed by reaction with 2-bromoisobutyryl bromide\n- **3a:** Silver tetrafluoroborate ($\\text{AgBF}_4$)\n\nB.\n- **1a:** Potassium naphthalenide\n- **2a:** Allyl bromide\n- **3a:** Titanium tetrachloride ($\\text{TiCl}_4$) with a trace of $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$\n\nC. \n- **1a:** Azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) with heating\n- **2a:** Divinylbenzene\n- **3a:** Boron trifluoride etherate ($\\text{BF}_3\\cdot\\text{OEt}_2$)\n\nD. \n- **1a:** Potassium 3,3-dimethyl-1-butoxide\n- **2a:** 2-Bromo-2-methylpropionyl bromide\n- **3a:** Titanium tetrachloride ($\\text{TiCl}_4$)\n\nE.\n- **1a:** Benzoyl peroxide with heating\n- **2a:** Carbon dioxide, followed by reaction with thionyl chloride ($\\text{SOCl}_2$)\n- **3a:** n-Butyllithium", "solution": "We must select a sequence of reagents that enables: (i) controlled ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of \\epsilon-caprolactone to make PCL with a defined, transformable end-group; (ii) quantitative conversion of the PCL chain end into an initiating site suitable for controlled polymerization of styrene; and (iii) conversion of the PCL-PS terminus into a cationic initiating site competent for living polymerization of isobutylene.\n\nFor step 1a, \\epsilon-caprolactone polymerizes in a controlled fashion by anionic or coordination-insertion ROP initiated by an alkoxide. A strong alkoxide such as potassium 3,3-dimethyl-1-butoxide generates a reactive alkoxide that opens the lactone ring and propagates with good control, yielding PCL bearing a terminal hydroxyl after quench. In contrast, n-butyllithium will not provide clean, controlled ROP of a lactone and risks side reactions; potassium naphthalenide is a strong reducing agent rather than an ROP initiator; and radical initiators such as AIBN or benzoyl peroxide do not effect controlled ROP of lactones. Therefore, potassium 3,3-dimethyl-1-butoxide is the synthetically viable choice.\n\nFor step 2a, to grow polystyrene in a controlled manner from the PCL chain end, the PCL terminal hydroxyl must be converted into a suitable macroinitiator for a controlled radical polymerization of styrene, most commonly atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). Acylation of the hydroxyl using 2-bromo-2-methylpropionyl bromide installs a 2-bromoisobutyrate end group, a standard ATRP initiator for styrene. Symbolically, if the PCL end-group is $\\text{PCL-OH}$, reaction with 2-bromo-2-methylpropionyl bromide affords $\\text{PCL-O-C(O)-C(CH}_3)_2\\text{Br}$, which under ATRP conditions yields $\\text{PCL-PS-Br}$ with controlled molecular weight and low dispersity. Allyl bromide would only form an ether and is not a controlled initiator for styrene; divinylbenzene is a crosslinker rather than an initiating group; ethylene oxide followed by 2-bromoisobutyryl bromide is unnecessary elaboration and is paired with an unsuitable step 1a; and conversion to a chloroformate via $\\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ then $\\mathrm{SOCl_{2}}$ does not create a known controlled initiator for styrene.\n\nFor step 3a, polymerization of isobutylene proceeds by living cationic mechanisms using strong Lewis acids (e.g., $\\text{TiCl}_4$ or $\\text{BF}_3\\cdot\\text{OEt}_2$) in the presence of an appropriate cationogen such as a tertiary alkyl halide or benzylic halide. After ATRP of styrene from a 2-bromoisobutyrate macroinitiator, the PCL-PS chain bears a terminal halide (typically bromide) at the PS end. A strong Lewis acid such as $\\text{TiCl}_4$ can abstract halide from a benzylic or tertiary halide terminus to generate a carbocation with a non-nucleophilic counterion, which then initiates living cationic polymerization of isobutylene under the standard low-temperature conditions. Among the listed choices, $\\text{TiCl}_4$ is a well-established Lewis acid for living cationic polymerization of isobutylene from tert-halide or benzylic halide initiators; $\\text{TiCl}_4$ with a trace of water is also known but appears only in an option with incorrect earlier steps; $\\text{BF}_3\\cdot\\text{OEt}_2$ generally requires an alcohol or a suitable tert-halide coinitiator not provided in the corresponding option; $\\text{AgBF}_4$ can abstract halide to generate a carbocation, but its use from a polystyrene halide end-group is less standard and can promote side reactions; n-butyllithium cannot initiate isobutylene, which polymerizes cationically, not anionically.\n\nTherefore, the only synthetically coherent and mechanistically sound combination across the three stages is:\n- Step 1a: potassium 3,3-dimethyl-1-butoxide for anionic ROP of \\epsilon-caprolactone to PCL with an alcohol terminus.\n- Step 2a: 2-bromo-2-methylpropionyl bromide to convert the PCL hydroxyl into an ATRP-competent 2-bromoisobutyrate macroinitiator for styrene, yielding PCL-PS with a terminal halide.\n- Step 3a: $\\text{TiCl}_4$ to effect halide abstraction at the PS terminus and generate a carbocation that initiates living cationic polymerization of isobutylene.\n\nThis set corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2158904"}]}
