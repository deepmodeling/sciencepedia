A fatty acid is a carboxylic acid with a long aliphatic chain, and many lipids incorporate fatty acids as acyl residues via ester or amide linkages.\n\nAnalyze each option based on whether fatty acid chains are present:\n- Option A (Triolein): This is a triacylglycerol in which glycerol is esterified with three molecules of oleic acid. Therefore, it contains three fatty acid chains.\n- Option B (Lecithin, a phosphatidylcholine): This glycerophospholipid has a glycerol backbone with two fatty acyl chains esterified at the first and second positions, and a phosphocholine at the third position. Therefore, it contains fatty acid chains.\n- Option C (Beeswax, major component myricyl palmitate): This is a wax ester formed from palmitic acid (a fatty acid) and a long-chain alcohol (myricyl alcohol). Therefore, it contains a fatty acid chain.\n- Option D (Testosterone): This is a steroid with a fused tetracyclic ring system derived from the sterol framework. Steroids are not built from fatty acid chains and do not contain fatty acyl residues in their core structure.

A chemically sound route should therefore (i) differentiate the secondary hydroxyl (sn-2) from the two primary hydroxyls (sn-1 and sn-3) to install the oleoyl group selectively at sn-2, and (ii) desymmetrize the remaining primary diol in a stereocontrolled manner to install the palmitoyl group specifically at sn-1. The provided enzyme, a lipase from Rhizomucor miehei, is known to catalyze selective acylation at the sn-1 position of monoacylglycerols, thereby controlling the sn configuration during acylation.\n\nAnalysis of the options:\n- Option A uses acid-catalyzed direct esterification of glycerol with two different acids. This is intrinsically nonselective, producing mixtures of mono-, di-, and triacylglycerols as well as positional isomers. It does not achieve stereospecificity or regioselectivity and is therefore not viable for the stated goal.\n- Option B proceeds via solketal (glycerol acetonide), which reveals a single primary hydroxyl for initial esterification and then unmasking for subsequent acylation. While this protects regiochemistry to some extent, formation of solketal from achiral glycerol generates a racemic acetonide and subsequent steps do not resolve this. The final diacylglycerol is obtained as a racemate with respect to sn configuration, not stereospecifically. Thus it fails the stereospecificity requirement.\n- Option C employs benzylidene acetal formation to protect the 1,3-diol of glycerol, exposing only the secondary hydroxyl at sn-2. Acylation with oleic acid using DCC/DMAP at this stage installs the oleoyl group selectively at sn-2. Removal of the benzylidene acetal (e.g., by hydrogenolysis as stated, or by acid hydrolysis) regenerates the 1,3-diol. The lipase from Rhizomucor miehei is then used to acylate specifically the sn-1 hydroxyl with palmitic acid, thereby desymmetrizing the primary diol and setting the correct sn configuration. This sequence achieves both the correct regiochemistry (oleoyl at sn-2, palmitoyl at sn-1) and the required stereospecificity via the enzyme-catalyzed acylation at sn-1.\n- Option D uses trityl protection of one primary hydroxyl, followed by chemical acylations and then removal of trityl by hydrogenolysis. This has two problems: trityl ethers are typically cleaved under acidic conditions, not by hydrogenolysis, so the stated deprotection is chemically unsound; moreover, the sequence does not include any element to ensure sn-stereospecificity and would generally provide a racemic outcome relative to sn configuration.\n- Option E mirrors Option C but swaps the acids: it installs palmitoyl at sn-2 first and then uses the lipase to acylate sn-1 with oleic acid, leading to 1-oleoyl-2-palmitoyl rather than the desired 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl, thus giving the wrong regiochemistry.\n\nTherefore, the only route that is both chemically viable and satisfies the regioselective and stereospecific requirements is Option C: benzylidene protection to expose sn-2 for oleoylation, followed by deprotection and lipase-catalyzed sn-1 acylation with palmitic acid.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2182690"}]}
