Identify the directionality of solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS): In standard SPPS, the peptide is assembled from the C-terminus to the N-terminus. Therefore, the first residue attached to the resin must be the C-terminal amino acid of the target peptide.\n\n2. Determine the C-terminal residue in glycylalanine (Gly-Ala): By convention, the sequence Gly-Ala denotes glycine at the N-terminus and alanine at the C-terminus. Hence, alanine is the first residue that must be attached to the resin.\n\n3. Apply the Fmoc strategy requirement: In an Fmoc-based SPPS, the amino acid to be attached to the resin must have its $\\alpha$-amino group protected with an Fmoc group to prevent undesired reactions during attachment and subsequent coupling steps. The carboxyl group is used to form the bond to the resin’s linker.\n\n4. Evaluate the options:\n- A (N-(9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)glycine): Glycine is not the C-terminal residue for Gly-Ala; using this would give the wrong sequence.\n- B (N-(9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)alanine): This is alanine with an Fmoc-protected $\\alpha$-amino group, exactly the required protected C-terminal residue for Fmoc-SPPS of Gly-Ala.\n- C (N-(tert-Butoxycarbonyl)alanine): Boc protection is used in Boc-based strategies, not in an Fmoc-based synthesis.\n- D (Alanine): Unprotected $\\alpha$-amino group would lead to side reactions; not compatible with the Fmoc strategy requirements for the initial loading.\n- E (N-(9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)glycylalanine): A preformed dipeptide is not used as the first loading step in this plan, which builds residues one by one.\n\n5.

The synthesis employs the standard Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl) N-terminal protection strategy. The process starts with Fmoc-Val covalently attached to a solid-phase resin. The synthesis protocol involves a repeating cycle of: 1) Fmoc deprotection using piperidine, 2) coupling of the next Fmoc-protected amino acid using a coupling agent like Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 3) thorough washing.\n\nDuring the synthesis, a malfunction causes the coupling step for Fmoc-Pro to be incomplete, meaning a significant fraction of the peptide chains on the resin do not react with Fmoc-Pro. No capping agent (like acetic anhydride) is used in the protocol to terminate these unreacted chains.

The synthesis begins with Fmoc-Val attached to the resin through its C-terminus. Each cycle consists of:\n1) Fmoc deprotection: piperidine removes the Fmoc group to reveal a free N-terminal amine on the resin-bound peptide.\n2) Coupling: the next Fmoc-protected amino acid is activated (e.g., by DCC) and coupled to the free amine.\n3) Washing: to remove reagents and byproducts.\n\nTarget sequence: Ala-Leu-Pro-Val, so the coupling order after resin-bound Val is Pro, then Leu, then Ala.\n\nAfter initial deprotection, the Pro coupling step is incomplete. This creates two resin-bound populations:\n- Population S (successful Pro coupling): Fmoc-Pro is attached to Val, giving Fmoc-Pro-Val on resin.\n- Population F (failed Pro coupling): no Pro is attached; the chain remains as deprotected H-Val on resin because no capping was used.\n\nThe next step in the automated cycle is Fmoc deprotection. On Population S, piperidine removes Fmoc from Pro to give H-Pro-Val (free amine on Pro). On Population F, there is no Fmoc to remove, and the N-terminus remains a free amine on Val (H-Val).\n\nThe subsequent coupling step for Fmoc-Leu goes to completion on all available free amines. Therefore:\n- Population S receives Fmoc-Leu on the free amine of Pro, yielding Fmoc-Leu-Pro-Val on resin.\n- Population F receives Fmoc-Leu directly on the free amine of Val, yielding Fmoc-Leu-Val on resin. This creates a deletion sequence lacking Pro.\n\nThe next cycle again deprotects Fmoc and couples the final Fmoc-Ala to completion:\n- Population S: Fmoc deprotection of Leu gives H-Leu-Pro-Val, then coupling of Fmoc-Ala yields Fmoc-Ala-Leu-Pro-Val.\n- Population F: Fmoc deprotection of Leu gives H-Leu-Val, then coupling of Fmoc-Ala yields Fmoc-Ala-Leu-Val.\n\nUpon final global deprotection and cleavage from the resin, the desired product Ala-Leu-Pro-Val is obtained from Population S, while the major side product arising from Population F is the deletion peptide Ala-Leu-Val.\n\nExclusion of other options:\n- Leu-Pro-Val would require failure of the final Ala coupling, but the problem states Leu and Ala couplings go to completion.\n- Ala-Pro-Val would require Leu coupling to fail, which contradicts completion of the Leu coupling.\n- Ala-Leu-Pro would lack the C-terminal Val, which is impossible because the synthesis is anchored on resin-bound Val.\n- Pro-Val would require subsequent couplings to fail, which contradicts that later couplings go to completion.\n\nTherefore, the major peptidic side product is Ala-Leu-Val, corresponding to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2199541"}, {"introduction": "A successful synthesis is not just about mixing reagents; it is also about carefully verifying the outcome of each step. This problem [@problem_id:2199569] delves into the practical aspects of monitoring SPPS, specifically focusing on the Kaiser test used to detect free amines after deprotection. It highlights a classic \"exception to the rule\"—the unique case of proline—and encourages you to think like a practicing chemist, troubleshooting an unexpected analytical result and selecting an appropriate alternative method to ensure the synthesis proceeds correctly.", "problem": "An undergraduate researcher is tasked with synthesizing the tripeptide Gly-Pro-Ala using an automated Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) instrument. The synthesis begins with an Fmoc-Ala-functionalized resin (a solid polymer support). The standard SPPS cycle consists of two main steps: (1) N-terminal deprotection, where the 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) protecting group is removed with a base (e.g., piperidine) to expose a free amine; and (2) coupling, where the next Fmoc-protected amino acid is activated and linked to the newly exposed amine.\n\nTo check for the completion of each deprotection step, a small sample of resin beads is subjected to the Kaiser test. This test involves heating the beads with solutions of ninhydrin, pyridine, and phenol. A successful deprotection, indicated by the presence of a free primary amine on the resin, yields a characteristic deep blue color (due to the formation of a chromophore called Ruhemann's purple). A resin with a protected N-terminus (an amide or carbamate) or no amine functionality will give a negative result (beads remain colorless or yellow).\n\nThe synthesis of the dipeptide on the resin proceeds smoothly:\n1.  Deprotection of Fmoc-Ala-Resin yields H₂N-Ala-Resin. A Kaiser test on a sample is positive (deep blue), confirming the presence of the free primary amine of alanine.\n2.  Coupling with Fmoc-Pro yields Fmoc-Pro-Ala-Resin. A Kaiser test on a sample is negative (yellow), as expected for the protected N-terminus.\n\nThe researcher then initiates the deprotection of this dipeptide to prepare for the final coupling:\n3.  The Fmoc-Pro-Ala-Resin is treated with piperidine to generate the deprotected peptide, H-Pro-Ala-Resin.\n\nUpon performing the Kaiser test on a sample of the H-Pro-Ala-Resin beads from step 3, the researcher is surprised to find that the beads turn a faint yellow-orange, not the expected deep blue. This result is typically interpreted as a failed deprotection. Assuming all reagents, solvents, and instrumental functions are correct, which of the following statements provides the best explanation for this observation and proposes the most appropriate subsequent procedure?\n\nA. The Fmoc deprotection in step 3 was incomplete due to steric hindrance, leaving most N-termini protected. The procedure should be to repeat the piperidine deprotection step for an extended time and then re-test with the Kaiser test.\n\nB. The coupling of proline in step 2 failed, so the test is detecting nothing. The procedure should be to start the synthesis over from the beginning with fresh resin.\n\nC. The N-terminal proline is a secondary amine and does not react with ninhydrin to form the blue Ruhemann's purple chromophore. The procedure should be to perform an alternative test, such as the isatin test, which gives a characteristic blue-green color for N-terminal proline, to confirm deprotection before proceeding to the next coupling step.\n\nD. The peptide bond between proline and alanine is unstable and was cleaved during the basic deprotection step. The procedure should be to cleave the resulting Ala-Resin from the support and confirm its identity using mass spectrometry.\n\nE. The Kaiser test reagents have degraded. The procedure should be to prepare fresh ninhydrin, phenol, and pyridine solutions and repeat the test on the H-Pro-Ala-Resin sample.", "solution": "The SPPS sequence described is standard: the Fmoc group is base-labile and is removed by piperidine to expose the N-terminal amine, after which the Kaiser test detects a free primary amine by formation of Ruhemann's purple in the presence of ninhydrin, pyridine, and phenol. The key chemical principle is that ninhydrin gives the characteristic deep blue chromophore only with primary amines; secondary amines do not form Ruhemann's purple and instead yield a yellow to orange color due to formation of different iminium-derived products.\n\nProline is a secondary amine (an imino acid) because its nitrogen is embedded in a pyrrolidine ring. Therefore, after deprotection of Fmoc-Pro-Ala-Resin with piperidine, the resin bears H-Pro-Ala-Resin with an N-terminal secondary amine, which is expected to give a negative or faint yellow-orange Kaiser test rather than the deep blue indicative of a primary amine. Thus, the observed faint yellow-orange is consistent with successful deprotection and the inherent limitation of the Kaiser test for secondary amines.\n\nConsequently, the correct explanation is that the Kaiser test is not suitable for detecting free N-terminal proline. The appropriate procedure is to employ an alternative test that detects secondary amines on resin, such as the isatin test, which yields a characteristic blue-green color for N-terminal proline (or alternatively, the chloranil test for secondary amines). Upon obtaining a positive isatin test, the synthesis can proceed to the next coupling (e.g., Fmoc-Gly).\n\nWhy the other options are not appropriate:\n- A: Incomplete Fmoc deprotection due to sterics is unlikely under standard piperidine conditions for Fmoc removal; moreover, even complete deprotection of proline would still not give a blue Kaiser test because the N-terminal amine is secondary. Repeating deprotection would not convert a secondary amine into a primary amine.\n- B: If proline coupling had failed, the resin would remain Fmoc-Ala-Resin; after deprotection in step 3, a free primary amine (H-Ala-Resin) would be generated, which would give a deep blue Kaiser test, contrary to observation. Additionally, a negative Kaiser test after step 2 supports successful coupling of proline.\n- D: Peptide bonds are stable to the basic conditions used for Fmoc deprotection; piperidine does not cleave the amide bond between proline and alanine under standard SPPS conditions. The observed color does not indicate bond cleavage.\n- E: The reagents are assumed correct by the problem statement, and earlier tests functioned as expected. The faint yellow-orange is the expected response with a secondary amine rather than evidence of reagent degradation.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation and next step are to recognize the limitation of the Kaiser test with secondary amines and use the isatin test to confirm deprotection before proceeding.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2199569"}]}
