The peptide is dissolved in an aqueous buffer solution maintained at a pH of 1.0. To predict its behavior in an electric field, the biochemist needs to determine its net electrical charge. Using the provided pKa values for the ionizable groups, calculate the net charge of the tetrapeptide at this pH.\n\nAssume the following pKa values:\n- The alpha-carboxyl group at the C-terminus: pKa = 2.1\n- The alpha-amino group at the N-terminus: pKa = 9.6\n- The side chain of Aspartic acid (Asp): pKa = 3.9\n- The side chain of Arginine (Arg): pKa = 12.5\n- The side chain of Lysine (Lys): pKa = 10.5\n- The side chain of Serine (Ser) is considered neutral and does not ionize in the relevant pH range.\n\nThe final answer should be an integer representing the net charge.", "solution": "We determine the net charge by summing the charges of all ionizable groups at the specified pH, using acid-base equilibrium.

When a peptide is synthesized from building blocks that are not stereochemically pure, a mixture of stereoisomers can result. This practice [@problem_id:2188897] challenges you to determine the total number of possible stereoisomers for a simple tripeptide, illustrating the combinatorial explosion of structures that chirality introduces and its importance for synthesis and biological recognition.", "problem": "A chemist is synthesizing a tripeptide composed exclusively of alanine residues, known as alanyl-alanyl-alanine (Ala-Ala-Ala). The synthesis is performed using racemic alanine as the sole amino acid starting material. Racemic alanine is an equimolar mixture of the two enantiomers, L-alanine and D-alanine. Assuming that the peptide bond formation occurs randomly and non-stereoselectively between any available alanine molecules, how many distinct stereoisomers of the tripeptide Ala-Ala-Ala can be formed in the final product mixture? Note that the N-terminus and C-terminus of a peptide are chemically distinct.", "solution": "Each alanine residue has one stereogenic center at its $\\alpha$-carbon. The tripeptide Ala-Ala-Ala therefore contains $n=3$ stereocenters, one in each residue.\n\nThe general counting principle for stereoisomers of a molecule with $n$ independent stereocenters is:\n$$\nN_{\\text{max}}=2^{n},\n$$\nwith a possible reduction if any mirror-image pairs are superposable due to internal symmetry (meso forms). Thus, the actual number is\n$$\nN=2^{n}-m,\n$$\nwhere $m$ counts any redundancies arising from meso symmetry.\n\nIn this tripeptide, although the three residues are of the same kind (alanine), the N-terminus and C-terminus are chemically distinct. This breaks any putative internal symmetry that could exchange the first and third residues. Consequently, there is no symmetry operation that renders a configuration identical to its mirror image, and there are no meso forms:\n$$\nm=0.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nN=2^{3}-0=8.\n$$\nEnantiomeric pairs are counted as distinct stereoisomers, and no pair collapses to a meso form because of the distinct termini.\n\nHence, the number of distinct stereoisomers possible in the product mixture is $8$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8}$$", "id": "2188897"}, {"introduction": "Determining the primary structure—the precise sequence of amino acids—is the first step in understanding any new protein or peptide.

Since the molecule is a tetrapeptide, this requires exactly two alanine residues and two glycine residues in the sequence.\n\nSecond, one cycle of Edman degradation on the intact tetrapeptide yields PTH-glycine, which directly identifies the N-terminal residue as glycine. Therefore, the sequence must begin with glycine.\n\nThird, gentle partial acid hydrolysis produces smaller peptide fragments. The confirmed presence of the dipeptide Gly-Gly among the products implies that two adjacent glycine residues occur in the intact sequence. Random cleavage can liberate dipeptides that reflect adjacent residues in the original primary structure, so observing Gly-Gly requires a Gly-Gly motif in the parent tetrapeptide.\n\nCombining these constraints:\n- The sequence must contain exactly two glycine and two alanine residues.\n- The N-terminus must be glycine.\n- The sequence must contain a Gly-Gly dipeptide.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A. Gly-Ala-Gly-Ala: starts with glycine but lacks Gly-Gly; eliminated.\n- B. Ala-Gly-Ala-Gly: wrong N-terminus; eliminated.\n- C. Gly-Ala-Ala-Gly: starts with glycine but lacks Gly-Gly; eliminated.\n- D. Ala-Ala-Gly-Gly: wrong N-terminus; eliminated.\n- E.
