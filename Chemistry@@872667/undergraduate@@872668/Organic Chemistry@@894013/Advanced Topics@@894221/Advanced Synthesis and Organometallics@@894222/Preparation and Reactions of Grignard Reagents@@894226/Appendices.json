This first practice problem explores this basicity by reacting a Grignard reagent with heavy water ($D_2O$), an isotopically labeled source of acid. Understanding this reaction is key to appreciating why Grignard syntheses must be conducted under strictly anhydrous conditions to prevent the reagent from being wastefully consumed.

This is an oxidative insertion producing an organomagnesium species in which the carbon bonded to magnesium is nucleophilic (carbanion-like), i.e., the bond is polarized as $C^{\\delta-}-Mg^{\\delta+}$.\n$$\\text{CH}_3-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{Br} + Mg \\rightarrow \\text{CH}_3-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{MgBr}$$\nHere, $\\text{CH}_3-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{MgBr}$ is $n$-propylmagnesium bromide, and the carbon bearing Mg is the terminal (C1) carbon.\n\nStep 2 (quench with $D_2O$): Grignard reagents are strong bases and nucleophiles; when treated with heavy water, they undergo deuterolysis (acid-base reaction) to replace the $C-MgBr$ bond with a $C-D$ bond, transferring a deuteron from $D_2O$ to the carbanion center.\n$$\\text{CH}_3-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{MgBr} + D_2O \\rightarrow \\text{CH}_3-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{D} + \\text{MgBr(OD)}$$\nThus, the organic product is deuterated at the carbon that originally bore Mg, namely the terminal carbon (C1), giving 1-deuteropropane.\n\nExcess $D_2O$ ensures complete quenching and prevents side reactions. No rearrangement occurs because the Grignard reagent is primary and there is no competing pathway to an alcohol under these conditions. Therefore, the correct choice is 1-deuteropropane.\n\nEliminations of other options:\n- Propan-1-ol would require reaction with a carbonyl followed by hydrolysis, not simple quench with $D_2O$.\n- 2-Deuteropropane would require deuteration at the secondary carbon, which does not occur here.\n- 1,2-Dideuteropropane would require two deuterations, which is not the outcome of a single deuterolysis of the Grignard reagent.\n- Propane would be formed with $H_2O$, not $D_2O$.\n\nHence, the major product is 1-deuteropropane.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2190508"}, {"introduction": "The creation of alcohols via carbon-carbon bond formation is a cornerstone of organic synthesis, and the Grignard reaction is a premier method for achieving this.
