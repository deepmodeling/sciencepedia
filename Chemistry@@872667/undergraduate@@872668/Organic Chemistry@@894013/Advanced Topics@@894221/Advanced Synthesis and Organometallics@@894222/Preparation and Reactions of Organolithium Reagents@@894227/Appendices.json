This promotes undesired side reactions (e.g., direct reduction or enolization by lithium, uncontrolled exotherm) and is not the best practice; furthermore, forming the organolithium in the presence of the electrophile is chemically unsound.\n- Option C uses ethanol, a protic solvent that will quench any organolithium:\n$$\\mathrm{C_{6}H_{5}Li} + \\mathrm{EtOH} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{C_{6}H_{6}} + \\mathrm{LiOEt},$$\npreventing the desired addition.\n- Option D omits the acidic workup; the isolated product would be the lithium alkoxide, not the target alcohol.\n- Option E exposes cyclohexanone to lithium metal first, which can induce single-electron reduction and side reactions (e.g., pinacol coupling), and only later adds bromobenzene, which will not form $\\mathrm{C_{6}H_{5}Li}$ under those conditions.
