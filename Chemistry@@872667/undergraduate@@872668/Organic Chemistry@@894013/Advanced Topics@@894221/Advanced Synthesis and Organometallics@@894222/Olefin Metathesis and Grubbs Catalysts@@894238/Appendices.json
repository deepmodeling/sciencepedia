The active catalyst is the methylidene complex $[L_nRu=CH_2]$. The RCM reaction produces cyclopentene and one molecule of ethylene per turnover. The isotopic composition of the ethylene byproduct provides insight into the operating mechanism.\n\nLet's analyze each scenario based on the Chauvin mechanism for olefin metathesis.\n\n**Analysis of Scenario A ($k_{RCM} \\gg k_{deg}$)**\n\nIn this scenario, the only significant pathway is the productive RCM. We are asked for the *initial* distribution of products. At the beginning of the reaction, the only catalyst species present is $[L_nRu=CH_2]$. This catalyst reacts with the substrate $S_{d2}$. The substrate has two distinct terminal olefin groups: a non-deuterated $H_2C=CH-$ group and a deuterated $D_2C=CH-$ group. Since we ignore kinetic isotope effects, the catalyst is equally likely to react with either end.\n\n**Path A1: Initiation at the non-deuterated terminus ($H_2C=CH-$)**\nThe $[L_nRu=CH_2]$ catalyst reacts with the $H_2C=CH-$ end of $S_{d2}$. This is an olefin metathesis reaction that releases one molecule of ethylene and generates a new ruthenium alkylidene.\n$$[L_nRu=CH_2] + H_2C=CH(CH_2)_2CH=CD_2 \\longrightarrow [L_nRu=CH(CH_2)_2CH=CD_2] + H_2C=CH_2$$\nThe ethylene produced is unlabeled ($d_0$-ethylene, $CH_2=CH_2$). The newly formed alkylidene then rapidly undergoes intramolecular cyclization to form the final product and regenerate a catalyst, but this second step does not produce ethylene.\n\n**Path A2: Initiation at the deuterated terminus ($D_2C=CH-$)**\nThe $[L_nRu=CH_2]$ catalyst reacts with the $D_2C=CH-$ end of $S_{d2}$. This reaction releases a different ethylene isotopologue.\n$$[L_nRu=CH_2] + D_2C=CH(CH_2)_2CH=CH_2 \\longrightarrow [L_nRu=CH(CH_2)_2CH=CH_2] + H_2C=CD_2$$\nThe ethylene produced is $d_2$-ethylene ($CH_2=CD_2$).\n\nSince the initial reaction of the catalyst must occur via one of these two equally probable paths, the very first molecules of ethylene evolved will be an equimolar mixture of $CH_2=CH_2$ and $CH_2=CD_2$. No $CD_2=CD_2$ ($d_4$-ethylene) can be formed initially, as this would require a $[L_nRu=CD_2]$ catalyst species, which has not yet been formed.\nTherefore, the initial molar ratio of $(CH_2=CH_2 : CH_2=CD_2 : CD_2=CD_2)$ for Scenario A is **(1:1:0)**.\n\n**Analysis of Scenario B ($k_{deg} \\gg k_{RCM}$)**\n\nIn this scenario, a fast, reversible degenerate metathesis occurs before any significant amount of the slower RCM takes place. This degenerate process exchanges the methylidene group on the catalyst with the terminal methylidene groups of the substrate.\nThe relevant equilibrium is:\n$$[L_nRu=CH_2] + H_2C=CH(CH_2)_2CH=CD_2 \\rightleftharpoons [L_nRu=CD_2] + H_2C=CH(CH_2)_2CH=CH_2$$\nThe substrate, $S_{d2}$, is present in large excess. It acts as a vast reservoir containing an equal number of $H_2C=$ and $D_2C=$ terminal groups. The catalyst's methylidene group will rapidly exchange with this reservoir until an equilibrium is established for the catalyst pool. Because the reservoir has a 1:1 ratio of $H_2C=$ and $D_2C=$ groups, the catalyst pool will quickly reach a steady state where $[[L_nRu=CH_2]] \\approx [[L_nRu=CD_2]]$.\nSo, before any significant RCM, the active catalyst exists as a **1:1 mixture of $[L_nRu=CH_2]$ and $[L_nRu=CD_2]$**.\n\nNow, this equilibrated catalyst mixture reacts via the slower RCM pathway with the substrate, which is still almost entirely un-scrambled $S_{d2}$. We need to determine the ethylene distribution from the reaction of this 1:1 catalyst mixture with $S_{d2}$. We can analyze the four possible initial reaction events, each having an equal probability of $0.5 \\times 0.5 = 0.25$:\n\n1.  **Catalyst $[L_nRu=CH_2]$ reacts at the $H_2C=$ end of $S_{d2}$:** This produces $CH_2=CH_2$ ($d_0$-ethylene).\n    (Probability: $0.5_{cat} \\times 0.5_{site} = 0.25$)\n\n2.  **Catalyst $[L_nRu=CH_2]$ reacts at the $D_2C=$ end of $S_{d2}$:** This produces $CH_2=CD_2$ ($d_2$-ethylene).\n    (Probability: $0.5_{cat} \\times 0.5_{site} = 0.25$)\n\n3.  **Catalyst $[L_nRu=CD_2]$ reacts at the $H_2C=$ end of $S_{d2}$:** This produces $CH_2=CD_2$ ($d_2$-ethylene).\n    (Probability: $0.5_{cat} \\times 0.5_{site} = 0.25$)\n\n4.  **Catalyst $[L_nRu=CD_2]$ reacts at the $D_2C=$ end of $S_{d2}$:** This produces $CD_2=CD_2$ ($d_4$-ethylene).\n    (Probability: $0.5_{cat} \\times 0.5_{site} = 0.25$)\n\nNow, we sum the probabilities to find the overall initial ratio:\n*   Total probability for $CH_2=CH_2$ ($d_0$): 0.25\n*   Total probability for $CH_2=CD_2$ ($d_2$): 0.25 (from event 2) + 0.25 (from event 3) = 0.50\n*   Total probability for $CD_2=CD_2$ ($d_4$): 0.25\n\nThe relative amounts of the produced ethylene isotopologues are proportional to these probabilities. Thus, the initial molar ratio of $(CH_2=CH_2 : CH_2=CD_2 : CD_2=CD_2)$ for Scenario B is (0.25 : 0.50 : 0.25), which simplifies to **(1:2:1)**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nFor Scenario A, the predicted ratio is (1:1:0).\nFor Scenario B, the predicted ratio is (1:2:1).\nThis corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2275216"}]}
