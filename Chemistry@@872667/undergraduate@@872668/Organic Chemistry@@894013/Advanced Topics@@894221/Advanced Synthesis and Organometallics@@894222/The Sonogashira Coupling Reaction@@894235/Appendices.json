The general transformation is:\n$$\n\\text{Ar–X} + \\text{RC}\\equiv\\text{CH} \\xrightarrow[\\text{CuI}]{\\text{Pd(0), amine}} \\text{Ar–C}\\equiv\\text{C–R}\n$$\nwhere Ar is an aryl group, X is a halide, and RC\\equivCH is a terminal alkyne.\n\nAssign the specific reactants: The aryl halide is 1-bromo-3-methylbenzene (meta-bromotoluene), so the aryl fragment is a benzene ring with a methyl substituent at position 3 and a reactive site at position 1 where bromine is located. The terminal alkyne is ethynylcyclohexane, which corresponds to cyclohexylacetylene, with the structure $C_{6}H_{11}-C\\equiv CH$ (i.e., R = cyclohexyl).\n\nApply the coupling outcome: The product is formed by replacing the aryl bromide at position 1 with the ethynyl fragment, giving an aryl-$C\\equiv C$-cyclohexyl linkage. Therefore, the benzene ring bears two substituents: at position 1, a cyclohexylethynyl group ($-C\\equiv C-C_{6}H_{11}$); at position 3, a methyl group.\n\nConstruct the IUPAC name using benzene as the parent ring: This yields 1-(cyclohexylethynyl)-3-methylbenzene.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A. 1-(cyclohexylethynyl)-3-methylbenzene: Matches the derived structure and standard naming using benzene as the parent.\n- B. 1-((3-methylphenyl)ethynyl)cyclohexane: Describes the same connectivity using cyclohexane as the parent; while structurally equivalent, the conventional and straightforward parent in this context is benzene, making A the preferred IUPAC name in this set.\n- C. 1-cyclohexyl-3-ethynyl-5-methylbenzene: Incorrect; this implies three separate substituents (cyclohexyl, ethynyl, and methyl) rather than a single cyclohexylethynyl substituent plus methyl.\n- D. 3-((cyclohexylethynyl)methyl)benzene: Incorrect; this would place a methylene ($-CH_2-$) between the ring and the alkyne, which is not formed in a Sonogashira coupling.\n\nTherefore, the correct selection is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2212929"}, {"introduction": "Real-world molecules often contain multiple potential reaction sites, making chemoselectivity a key concept in synthesis.

Consider the reaction of 1-bromo-4-chlorobenzene with exactly one equivalent of phenylacetylene in the presence of a suitable palladium catalyst, a copper(I) co-catalyst, and a base.

No reaction occurs under these conditions.", "solution": "1) Identify the reactive sites and reagents. The substrate 1-bromo-4-chlorobenzene contains two aryl carbon–halogen bonds, $C-Br$ and $C-Cl$. The Sonogashira coupling joins a terminal alkyne (phenylacetylene) to an aryl or vinyl halide under Pd/Cu catalysis and base.\n\n2) Establish chemoselectivity based on oxidative addition rates. The key step controlling which carbon–halogen bond reacts is oxidative addition of the aryl halide to $Pd(0)$. The well-established reactivity order for aryl halides toward $Pd(0)$ oxidative addition under standard Sonogashira conditions is\n$$\n\\text{Ar–I} \\;>\\; \\text{Ar–Br} \\;\\gg\\; \\text{Ar–Cl}.\n$$\nTherefore, in a mixed dihalide containing Br and Cl, the Pd catalyst inserts selectively into the $C-Br$ bond, not the $C-Cl$ bond, under typical conditions.\n\n3) Consider stoichiometry and single-coupling conditions. The problem specifies exactly one equivalent of phenylacetylene and conditions that favor a single coupling event. Thus, only one aryl–halogen bond will be replaced by the alkynyl group, and the other halogen remains intact.\n\n4) Outline the catalytic sequence consistent with this selectivity:\n- Base deprotonates phenylacetylene to give the acetylide, which is captured by Cu(I) to form a copper acetylide.\n- $Pd(0)$ undergoes oxidative addition into the aryl $C-Br$ bond of 1-bromo-4-chlorobenzene to form an $aryl-Pd(II)-Br$ complex.\n- Transmetalation transfers the alkynyl group from Cu to Pd, yielding an $aryl-Pd(II)-alkynyl$ species.\n- Reductive elimination forms the aryl–alkynyl C–C bond and regenerates $Pd(0)$, leaving the chlorine substituent untouched.\n\n5) Deduce the structure of the product. Since coupling occurs at the aryl bromide position and only one coupling occurs, the bromine is replaced by the phenylethynyl group while the chlorine remains para to it. The product is 1-chloro-4-(phenylethynyl)benzene.\n\n6) Match to the provided options. This corresponds to option B. Options A and D are inconsistent with selectivity or substitution pattern; option C requires two coupling events; option E is incorrect because standard Sonogashira conditions do effect coupling at aryl bromides.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2212942"}, {"introduction": "A successful reaction requires not only the correct coupling partners but also compatibility with all functional groups present. This problem [@problem_id:2212915] explores a common challenge in synthesis: the presence of acidic protons that can interfere with the reaction's base-mediated mechanism. Analyzing this scenario will deepen your understanding of reaction conditions and the necessity of strategies like protecting group chemistry, as the base can be consumed in non-productive acid-base reactions.", "problem": "An organic chemistry student is attempting to synthesize 5-phenyl-4-pentyn-1-ol via a Sonogashira coupling reaction. The synthetic plan involves reacting 3-butyn-1-ol with iodobenzene in the presence of a palladium(0) catalyst, copper(I) iodide as a co-catalyst, and triethylamine as a base. After running the reaction and performing a work-up, the student finds that the reaction has failed, with very little of the desired product formed. The issue is determined to be an unintended reaction pathway involving the 3-butyn-1-ol starting material.\n\nWhich one of the following statements provides the most accurate and significant chemical reason for the failure of this specific Sonogashira coupling?\n\nA. The hydroxyl group of 3-butyn-1-ol acts as a ligand, binding strongly to the palladium catalyst and effectively poisoning it.\n\nB. The hydroxyl group undergoes oxidation by the copper(I) catalyst to form an aldehyde, consuming the starting material in a pathway unrelated to coupling.\n\nC. The triethylamine base reacts with the iodobenzene in a competing elimination reaction, preventing the oxidative addition step.\n\nD. The hydroxyl proton of 3-butyn-1-ol is significantly more acidic than the terminal alkyne proton, leading the triethylamine base to preferentially form an alkoxide rather than the required acetylide anion.\n\nE. The copper(I) iodide co-catalyst is insoluble in the presence of an alcohol, causing it to precipitate out of the reaction mixture before it can participate in the catalytic cycle.", "solution": "The Sonogashira coupling of a terminal alkyne with an aryl iodide proceeds via the following key catalytic steps: oxidative addition of the aryl iodide to a palladium(0) complex to form an arylpalladium(II) iodide, generation of an acetylide (often as a copper acetylide in the presence of copper(I) iodide), transmetallation to palladium, and reductive elimination to forge the new carbon-carbon bond. A base is required to generate the acetylide from the terminal alkyne.\n\nIn the substrate 3-butyn-1-ol, two acidic protons are present: the hydroxyl proton and the terminal alkyne proton. The fundamental acid-base principle governing deprotonation by a given base is that the more acidic site (the one with the lower acid dissociation constant) will be deprotonated preferentially. Symbolically, if $pK_{a,\\text{ROH}}  pK_{a,\\text{RC}\\equiv CH}$, then a base such as triethylamine will preferentially abstract the hydroxyl proton to give an alkoxide $\\text{RO}^-$ rather than the required acetylide $\\text{RC}\\equiv\\text{C}^-$. Because Sonogashira coupling requires formation of the acetylide (often via copper activation), preferential formation of the alkoxide diverts the base and diminishes or prevents formation of the alkyne-derived nucleophile needed for transmetallation, thereby suppressing the desired coupling pathway.\n\nEvaluating the options against known reactivity:\n- A is not the dominant issue: simple alcohols are weak ligands for palladium and are not typical catalyst poisons under Sonogashira conditions.\n- B is incorrect: copper(I) iodide does not oxidize primary alcohols to aldehydes under these conditions.\n- C is incorrect: iodobenzene lacks the structural prerequisites for a base-induced elimination with triethylamine; oxidative addition to palladium is not prevented by such a pathway.\n- E is incorrect: copper(I) iodide typically forms soluble amine complexes under Sonogashira conditions; the presence of an alcohol does not inherently precipitate it and is not the principal cause of failure.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and significant reason for failure with 3-butyn-1-ol is the acid-base competition in which the hydroxyl proton, being more acidic than the terminal alkyne proton, is preferentially deprotonated by triethylamine, preventing efficient acetylide formation required for the coupling.
