The general transformation is:\n$$\nR_{2}CuLi + R'X \\to R{-}R' \\quad (\\text{plus byproducts})\n$$\nKey principles for highest yield:\n- Only one $R$ group from $R_{2}CuLi$ is transferred in the coupling; the other serves as part of the cuprate leaving fragment.\n- The reaction is most efficient with primary alkyl halides; secondary unactivated alkyl halides, especially cycloalkyl halides like cyclopentyl bromide, are poor $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}2$ substrates and often fail or give low yield due to steric hindrance and unfavorable backside approach.\n- Avoid branched or secondary alkyl halides; choose an unbranched primary halide as $R'X$ and place the complementary fragment as $R$ on the cuprate.\n\nThe target propylcyclopentane can be constructed by coupling a cyclopentyl fragment with a propyl fragment. To maximize yield, the propyl fragment should be introduced as the primary alkyl halide $R'X$ (e.g., 1-bromopropane), and the cyclopentyl fragment should be the transferable $R$ on the cuprate.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- Option A: Lithium dicyclopentylcuprate as $R_{2}CuLi$ with $R=\\text{cyclopentyl}$ and 1-bromopropane as $R'X$ (primary).

Lithium dimethylcuprate, $(CH_{3})_{2}CuLi$, is a Gilman reagent that reacts with alkyl halides via bimolecular nucleophilic substitution at carbon to form a carbon–carbon bond. The general stoichiometry for coupling with an alkyl iodide $R\\text{-}I$ is:\n$$\nR\\text{-}I + (CH_{3})_{2}CuLi \\to R\\text{-}CH_{3} + RCu + LiI\n$$\nThis proceeds by an $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}2$ pathway, which is fastest for primary alkyl halides and much slower for secondary alkyl halides. Tertiary halides typically do not react by this pathway.\n\nAssign the two potential substrates and their products:\n- For $R=$ 1-hexyl (from 1-iodohexane, a primary iodide), the product is $n$-heptane.\n- For $R=$ 2-hexyl (from 2-iodohexane, a secondary iodide), the product is 2-methylhexane.\n\nBecause the mixture contains equimolar amounts of 1-iodohexane and 2-iodohexane, and exactly one molar equivalent of $(CH_{3})_{2}CuLi$ is added, the total amount of coupling that can occur equals one equivalent. Let $k_{1}$ and $k_{2}$ be the second-order rate constants for reaction of $(CH_{3})_{2}CuLi$ with 1-iodohexane and 2-iodohexane, respectively.
