Aryl chlorides are less reactive and generally require more specialized bulky, electron-rich ligands (e.g., BrettPhos, XPhos).

The reaction involves coupling an aryl halide with an amine in the presence of a palladium catalyst, a phosphine ligand, and a base. The chemist has two possible aryl chloride starting materials: 4-nitrochlorobenzene and 4-methoxychlorobenzene.

Both compounds will react at nearly the same rate, as the rate is primarily determined by the carbon-chlorine bond strength, which is not significantly affected by the para-substituent.\nD. 4-nitrochlorobenzene, because the nitro group is a Lewis base that can coordinate to the palladium catalyst, thereby increasing the effective local concentration of the catalyst near the reaction site.\nE. 4-methoxychlorobenzene, because the electron-donating methoxy group increases the nucleophilicity of the aromatic ring, facilitating the initial interaction with the catalyst.", "solution": "We analyze the Buchwald-Hartwig amination mechanism under identical conditions for two aryl chlorides: 4-nitrochlorobenzene and 4-methoxychlorobenzene. The canonical catalytic cycle involves:\n- Oxidative addition of the aryl chloride to a Pd(0) complex to give an aryl–Pd(II)–Cl species.\n- Amine coordination and deprotonation to form an aryl–Pd(II)–amido complex.\n- Reductive elimination to form the C–N bond, regenerating Pd(0).\n\nFor aryl chlorides, the oxidative addition step is commonly rate-determining because the C–Cl bond is strong and its activation is highly sensitive to the electronic nature of the aryl ring. In oxidative addition of Pd(0) into an aryl C–Cl bond, Pd donates electron density into the $\\sigma^{*}$ orbital of the C–Cl bond while accepting back-donation; in the transition state, there is significant polarization with partial positive character at the aryl ipso carbon and developing chloride departure. An electron-withdrawing substituent on the aromatic ring stabilizes this transition state by:\n- Lowering the energy of the $\\sigma^{*}_{\\text{C–Cl}}$ orbital, improving overlap and facilitating insertion.\n- Increasing the electrophilicity at the ipso carbon, which favors bond polarization during oxidative addition.\n\nBy contrast, an electron-donating substituent raises the aryl ring electron density, making the aryl carbon less electrophilic and the C–Cl bond less susceptible to oxidative addition.\n\nThis trend is captured by Hammett correlations for oxidative addition of aryl halides to Pd(0), often showing a positive reaction constant $\\rho$ in the relation\n$$\n\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{k}{k_{0}}\\right)=\\rho\\,\\sigma,\n$$\nindicating that substituents with positive $\\sigma$ (electron-withdrawing) increase the rate constant $k$ relative to $k_{0}$.\n\nApplying this to the two substrates:\n- 4-nitrochlorobenzene bears a strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group, which accelerates oxidative addition.\n- 4-methoxychlorobenzene bears a strongly electron-donating methoxy group, which retards oxidative addition.\n\nTherefore, 4-nitrochlorobenzene would react faster. Evaluating the options:\n- A correctly attributes the increased rate to the electron-withdrawing nitro group enhancing susceptibility to oxidative addition.\n- B is incorrect because electron donation generally slows oxidative addition of aryl chlorides.\n- C is incorrect; para substituents significantly modulate rate beyond intrinsic C–Cl bond strength.\n- D is incorrect; the nitro group is a poor ligand for Pd under these conditions and coordination is not the primary cause of rate acceleration.\n- E is incorrect; nucleophilicity of the aromatic ring is not the key factor in oxidative addition to Pd(0).\n\nHence the best explanation is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2208817"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply forming a bond, a key goal of modern synthesis is to control *where* a reaction occurs in a complex molecule. This practice explores the concept of chemoselectivity in the context of a molecule with two reactive amine groups. You will analyze how the choice of a phosphine ligand—from a simple, classical one to a modern, sterically demanding biarylphosphine—can be used to steer the reaction towards a single arylation, showcasing the power of ligand design in achieving synthetic precision [@problem_id:2208821].", "problem": "A chemist is designing a synthesis of N-phenylethylenediamine via a palladium-catalyzed Buchwald-Hartwig amination. The proposed reaction couples ethylenediamine ($H_2N-CH_2-CH_2-NH_2$) with an excess of bromobenzene ($Ph-Br$) in the presence of a palladium precursor and a suitable base. To optimize the reaction for the desired monoarylated product and minimize the formation of the N,N'-diphenylethylenediamine side product, two different phosphine ligands are considered for separate experiments under otherwise identical conditions:\n\n-   **Ligand A:** Triphenylphosphine ($PPh_3$)\n-   **Ligand B:** Di-tert-butyl(2',4',6'-triisopropyl-3,6-dimethoxybiphenyl-2-yl)phosphine (a bulky biarylphosphine ligand, also known as RockPhos)\n\nBased on the established principles of ligand effects in palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the outcome and provides the correct scientific rationale?\n\nA. Ligand A ($PPh_3$) will afford a higher yield of the monoarylated product. This is because its smaller steric profile leads to a more active catalyst that rapidly consumes the ethylenediamine before the second arylation can significantly proceed.\nB. Ligand B (RockPhos) will afford a higher yield of the monoarylated product. The primary reason is that its significant steric bulk creates a crowded catalytic site that selectively reacts with the smaller ethylenediamine over the bulkier monoarylated product intermediate, thus disfavoring the second arylation step.\nC. Ligand B (RockPhos) will afford a higher yield of the monoarylated product. This is because its strong electron-donating properties make the palladium center highly electron-rich, causing it to preferentially bind to the more basic primary amine of ethylenediamine over the less basic amine groups present in the monoarylated product.\nD. Both ligands are expected to produce predominantly the diarylated product, N,N'-diphenylethylenediamine. The use of excess bromobenzene ensures that any monoarylated product formed will rapidly undergo a second arylation, regardless of the ligand's properties.\nE. Ligand A ($PPh_3$) will favor diarylation, while Ligand B (RockPhos) will be largely unreactive and fail to produce significant product. The extreme steric hindrance of RockPhos prevents the necessary coordination of the amine to the palladium center, inhibiting the catalytic cycle.", "solution": "Mechanistic framework: The Buchwald-Hartwig amination proceeds via oxidative addition of the aryl halide to a Pd(0)-ligand complex, amine coordination followed by deprotonation to form a Pd(II)-amido complex, and reductive elimination to forge the C–N bond and regenerate Pd(0). Ligand steric and electronic properties control (i) the ligand nuclearity at palladium (monoligated versus bis-ligated), (ii) rates of oxidative addition and reductive elimination, and (iii) the facility of amine coordination and deprotonation. These effects collectively influence chemoselectivity between the first and second arylation steps when the nucleophile has more than one amine.\n\nLigand properties: Dialkylbiarylphosphines such as RockPhos are both strongly electron-donating and highly sterically demanding, favoring monoligated Pd species that undergo fast oxidative addition and especially fast reductive elimination. Their substantial steric bulk creates a congested coordination environment around palladium. In contrast, triphenylphosphine is less electron-donating and less bulky, more prone to form bis-ligated Pd species, and typically gives less reactive catalysts for C–N coupling compared to modern biarylphosphines.\n\nSelectivity logic for mono- versus diarylation: The first arylation couples the small, unhindered primary amine of ethylenediamine efficiently. After the first arylation, the remaining substrate for a second arylation is a bulkier monoarylated diamine. Although the second coupling still targets a primary amine on that intermediate, the overall molecule is more hindered and can chelate or present an unfavorable steric environment at the metal center. Bulky biarylphosphine ligands selectively accelerate the first coupling while disfavoring coordination and turnover with the more hindered monoarylated intermediate, thereby suppressing overarylation. This steric gating is a well-established strategy to achieve monoarylation in polyamines.\n\nAssessment of the options:\n- A is incorrect: PPh3 does not generally give a more active catalyst than a bulky biarylphosphine, and reduced steric bulk does not intrinsically prevent the second arylation.\n- B is correct: RockPhos, by virtue of its steric bulk, creates a congested catalytic pocket that reacts preferentially with the smaller ethylenediamine and disfavors subsequent arylation of the bulkier monoarylated intermediate, increasing monoarylation selectivity.\n- C is incorrect on two counts: electron richness alone does not enforce the claimed selectivity, and appealing to preferential binding to a more basic primary amine would, if anything, facilitate the second arylation rather than suppress it.\n- D is incorrect: excess aryl bromide does not guarantee diarylation; ligand choice can strongly bias toward monoarylation under otherwise identical conditions.\n- E is incorrect: RockPhos-class ligands are among the most effective for amination; they are not rendered unreactive by their steric hindrance.\n\nTherefore, the outcome most consistent with established ligand effects is that RockPhos increases the yield of the monoarylated product by sterically disfavoring the second arylation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2208821"}]}
