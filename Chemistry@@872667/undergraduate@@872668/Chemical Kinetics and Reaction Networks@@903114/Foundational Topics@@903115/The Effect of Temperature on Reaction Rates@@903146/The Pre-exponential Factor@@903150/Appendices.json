To determine this, we must analyze the units of the terms in the rate law and the Arrhenius equation.\n\nFirst, let's consider the general form of a rate law for a reaction:\n$$\n\\text{Rate} = k [\\text{Reactant}]^n\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the rate constant, $[\\text{Reactant}]$ is the concentration of the reactant, and $n$ is the order of the reaction with respect to that reactant. The overall rate of a reaction always has units of concentration per unit time. Based on the problem statement, the units of concentration are moles per liter (M) and the units of time are seconds (s). Therefore, the units of the rate are $\\text{M s}^{-1}$.\n\nThe problem states that the reaction is zero-order. This means the overall reaction order is $n=0$. The rate law for this specific reaction is:\n$$\n\\text{Rate} = k [\\text{Reactant}]^0\n$$\nSince any quantity raised to the power of zero is 1, the rate law simplifies to:\n$$\n\\text{Rate} = k\n$$\nThis means that for a zero-order reaction, the rate constant $k$ is equal to the rate of the reaction.

The transition state of the molecule is significantly more constrained and ordered than the ground-state reactant molecule, leading to a large negative entropy of activation.\nD. The reaction proceeds from a rigid, cyclic reactant to a flexible, open-chain diradical-like transition state, resulting in a large positive entropy of activation.\nE. The reaction mechanism does not involve a single transition state; instead, it is a complex chain reaction involving several radical intermediates.", "solution": "The problem asks for a mechanistic explanation for an experimentally observed pre-exponential factor ($A \\approx 4.0 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ s}^{-1}$) that is significantly larger than the typical value of $\\sim 10^{13} \\text{ s}^{-1}$ for a unimolecular reaction. We will use Transition State Theory (TST) to analyze the pre-exponential factor.\n\nThe Arrhenius equation relates the rate constant $k$ to the temperature $T$:\n$$k = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{RT}\\right)$$\nwhere $A$ is the pre-exponential factor, $E_a$ is the activation energy, and $R$ is the ideal gas constant. For unimolecular reactions, a simple interpretation suggests that $A$ is related to the frequency of the vibrational mode that leads to bond breaking, which is typically in the range of $10^{13}$ to $10^{14} \\text{ s}^{-1}$. The observed value is about 100 times larger than this, indicating that a more sophisticated model is needed.\n\nTransition State Theory provides a more detailed expression for the rate constant, known as the Eyring equation:\n$$k = \\frac{k_B T}{h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{RT}\\right)$$\nHere, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $h$ is the Planck constant, and $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ is the Gibbs free energy of activation, which is the change in Gibbs free energy in going from the reactants to the transition state.\n\nThe Gibbs free energy of activation can be expressed in terms of the enthalpy of activation, $\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}$, and the entropy of activation, $\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}$:\n$$\\Delta G^{\\ddagger} = \\Delta H^{\\ddagger} - T\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}$$\nSubstituting this into the Eyring equation gives:\n$$k = \\frac{k_B T}{h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H^{\\ddagger} - T\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}}{RT}\\right) = \\frac{k_B T}{h} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}}{R}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}}{RT}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we can compare this TST expression for $k$ with the empirical Arrhenius equation. For a gas-phase unimolecular reaction, the activation energy is related to the enthalpy of activation by $E_a = \\Delta H^{\\ddagger} + RT$.

Since the observed $A$ is approximately $4.0 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ s}^{-1}$, the factor $\\exp(\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}/R)$ must be large and positive.\n$$A \\approx (10^{13} \\text{ s}^{-1}) \\times \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}}{R}\\right) \\approx 4.0 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ s}^{-1}$$\nFor this to be true, $\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}$ must be large and positive.\n\nA positive entropy of activation ($\\Delta S^{\\ddagger} > 0$) means that the transition state has higher entropy (is more \"disordered\" or has more accessible microstates) than the reactant molecule. Let's analyze the options in light of this deduction:\n\nA. The exothermicity of a reaction relates to the overall change in enthalpy ($\\Delta H_{rxn}$), which is a thermodynamic property, not the activation kinetics. A reaction can be highly exothermic but very slow (high $E_a$). This statement confuses thermodynamics with kinetics.\n\nB. The activation energy, $E_a$, primarily affects the exponential term $\\exp(-E_a/RT)$, determining how the rate changes with temperature. It does not directly determine the value of the pre-exponential factor $A$. This option confuses the roles of $A$ and $E_a$.\n\nC. A large negative entropy of activation ($\\Delta S^{\\ddagger} < 0$) would imply $\\exp(\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}/R) < 1$. This would lead to a pre-exponential factor *smaller* than the typical $\\sim 10^{13} \\text{ s}^{-1}$, which is the opposite of what is observed. This scenario corresponds to a transition state that is more ordered than the reactant.\n\nD. This option describes the decomposition of a strained, rigid cyclic molecule (oxacyclobutane). The breaking of a C-C or C-O bond in the ring would lead to an open-chain, flexible structure in the transition state. This flexible structure has many more accessible rotational and low-frequency vibrational modes (degrees of freedom) compared to the constrained ring. This large increase in conformational freedom corresponds to a significant increase in entropy, meaning $\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}$ is large and positive. This directly explains why the factor $\\exp(\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}/R)$ is large, leading to an unusually high pre-exponential factor $A$. This is a classic explanation for high pre-exponential factors in ring-opening reactions.\n\nE. If the reaction were a complex chain reaction, its overall kinetics would likely not be a simple first-order process, and the interpretation of the experimentally fitted 'A' would be more complicated than the unimolecular TST model. While possible in reality, the prompt specifies a unimolecular reaction and asks for an explanation within that framework. Option D provides a direct and well-established explanation for the observed phenomenon in a unimolecular decomposition.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible explanation is the large positive entropy of activation resulting from the formation of a flexible transition state from a rigid reactant.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1522481"}]}
