Unlike complex reactions, where the rate law must be determined experimentally, the rate law for an elementary step can be written down by inspecting the reactant molecules involved in the collision. This first practice exercise is a fundamental check of this core principle, asking you to determine the overall reaction order directly from the molecularity of a given elementary reaction [@problem_id:1482307].", "problem": "In a controlled study of gas-phase reaction mechanisms, a particular reaction is found to proceed via a single, direct collision. This process is classified as an elementary reaction. The balanced stoichiometric equation for this elementary step is:\n\n$2\\text{A} + \\text{B} \\rightarrow \\text{C} + \\text{D}$\n\nwhere A, B, C, and D are all chemical species in the gas phase. The experiment is conducted at a constant temperature $T$ in a vessel of volume $V$.

Many chemical processes do not proceed in only one direction. This practice challenges you to construct the net rate of change for a species involved in a reversible elementary reaction by treating the forward and reverse processes as two distinct elementary steps [@problem_id:1482294]. Mastering this allows you to write differential equations that describe how a system approaches equilibrium.", "problem": "A chemical species A undergoes a reversible dimerization reaction in the gas phase. This entire process is described by a single elementary step, represented by the chemical equation:\n$$\n2A \\rightleftharpoons A_2\n$$\nThe forward dimerization reaction ($2A \\to A_2$) has a rate constant denoted by $k_f$, and the reverse dissociation reaction ($A_2 \\to 2A$) has a rate constant denoted by $k_r$.\n\nDerive the complete differential rate expression for the net rate of change of the concentration of species A, which is denoted as $\\frac{d[A]}{dt}$.

It is tempting to assume that if an experimentally determined rate law matches the stoichiometry of the overall reaction, the reaction must be elementary. This problem asks you to critically evaluate this assumption, considering the physical plausibility of multi-molecule collisions and the possibility that a more complex, multi-step mechanism could produce the same observable rate law [@problem_id:1482335].", "problem": "The oxidation of nitrogen monoxide to nitrogen dioxide is a key reaction in atmospheric chemistry.

Which of the following statements provides the most accurate scientific evaluation of the student's proposal?\n\nA. The proposal is correct. The fact that the exponents in the rate law match the stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced equation proves that the reaction occurs in a single step.\nB. The proposal is incorrect. The stoichiometry of the overall balanced equation can never be used to determine the rate law, as the rate is always determined by a multi-step mechanism.\nC. The proposal describes a mechanism that is consistent with the experimental rate law, but it is considered physically implausible because it requires a statistically rare simultaneous collision of three molecules.\nD.
