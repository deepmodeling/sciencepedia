At fixed pH, $[{\\mathrm{OH}}^{-}]$ is constant; thus $k_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ should be an affine linear function of $[\\mathrm{AcO}^{-}]$ with a constant intercept.\n\nWe now test these predictions against the data.\n\nFirst, compare runs 1 and 2, both at pH equal to $5.00$. Under specific base catalysis, the prediction is\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{obs}}(1)=k_{\\mathrm{obs}}(2)=k_{\\mathrm{OH}}[{\\mathrm{OH}}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{pH}=5.00},\n$$\ni.e., $k_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ should be the same when pH is the same.
