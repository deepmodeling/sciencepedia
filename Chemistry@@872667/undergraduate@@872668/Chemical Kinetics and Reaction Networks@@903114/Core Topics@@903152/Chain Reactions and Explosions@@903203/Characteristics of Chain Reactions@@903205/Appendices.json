Unlike simple elementary reactions where the rate is typically maximal at the start, chain reactions exhibit a unique kinetic profile because their progress depends on the presence of reactive intermediates. This exercise challenges you to visualize the initial stages of a chain reaction, providing a crucial qualitative understanding of why the concentration of chain carriers is a key factor governing the overall reaction rate [@problem_id:1476693].", "problem": "Consider the gas-phase decomposition of reactant $A_2$ occurring via two different proposed mechanisms at the same initial temperature and reactant concentration.\n\n**Mechanism 1: A Simple Elementary Reaction**\nThe decomposition occurs in a single step through a collision with a background species $M$:\n$$ A_2 + M \\xrightarrow{k_1} P_1 + P_2 + M $$\nwhere $P_1$ and $P_2$ are products and $M$ is a non-reactive collision partner.\n\n**Mechanism 2: A Chain Reaction**\nThe decomposition is initiated by the slow thermal decomposition of an initiator molecule, $I$, and proceeds via the following steps:\n1.  **Initiation:** $I \\xrightarrow{k_i} 2R\\cdot$ (slow)\n2.  **Propagation:** $R\\cdot + A_2 \\xrightarrow{k_p} P_3 + R\\cdot$ (fast)\n3.  **Termination:** $2R\\cdot \\xrightarrow{k_t} Q$ (fast)\n\nHere, $R\\cdot$ is a highly reactive radical species (the chain carrier), and $P_3$ and $Q$ are stable products. The propagation step is the primary pathway for the consumption of $A_2$.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate qualitative description of the initial behavior of the rate of consumption of the reactant $A_2$ in Mechanism 2 (the chain reaction), and correctly contrasts it with the behavior in Mechanism 1 (the elementary reaction)?\n\nA. The rate of consumption of $A_2$ is initially very slow and then accelerates before eventually slowing down. This is because the concentration of the chain-carrying radicals, $R\\cdot$, must first build up from zero.\n\nB. The rate of consumption of $A_2$ is at its absolute maximum at time $t=0$ and then decreases steadily as $A_2$ is consumed, identical to the behavior in Mechanism 1.\n\nC. The rate of consumption of $A_2$ is zero for a distinct period of time (an induction period), after which the reaction abruptly begins at a constant high rate.\n\nD. The rate of consumption of $A_2$ proceeds at a constant, non-zero rate from the very beginning, because the propagation step is fast and immediately takes over.\n\nE. The rate of consumption of $A_2$ will oscillate rapidly, as the concentration of the radical $R\\cdot$ is cyclically produced in the initiation step and consumed in the termination step.", "solution": "For Mechanism 1 (elementary step), the rate of consumption of $A_{2}$ follows the elementary rate law\n$$-\\frac{d[A_{2}]}{dt} = k_{1}[A_{2}][M].$$\nAt fixed temperature and with $[M]$ effectively constant, the initial rate is\n$$\\left(-\\frac{d[A_{2}]}{dt}\\right)_{t=0} = k_{1}[A_{2}]_{0}[M],$$\nwhich is the maximum at $t=0$, and it then decreases monotonically as $[A_{2}]$ declines.\n\nFor Mechanism 2 (chain reaction), let $[R]$ denote the radical concentration.

This behavior contrasts with Mechanism 1, where the initial rate is maximal at $t=0$ and decreases monotonically thereafter. Among the options, this is described by option A, while options B, C, D, and E do not match the derived kinetics: B incorrectly states a maximum at $t=0$ identical to Mechanism 1; C incorrectly asserts a finite induction period with zero rate and an abrupt onset; D incorrectly claims a constant non-zero rate from the start; E suggests oscillations not implied by the given steps.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1476693"}, {"introduction": "The steady-state approximation (SSA) is a powerful and fundamental tool for analyzing the kinetics of chain reactions, allowing us to derive rate laws by assuming the concentration of reactive intermediates is constant.

The initiation and propagation steps are identical in both experiments:\n- **Initiation**: The initiator $I$ decomposes to form two radical species $R\\cdot$ with a rate constant $k_i$. The rate of radical formation is given by $v_{init} = 2k_i[I]$.\n- **Propagation**: A radical $R\\cdot$ reacts with a monomer $M$ to form the product and regenerate the radical. The rate of the overall reaction, $v$, is determined by this step: $v = k_p[R\\cdot][M]$, where $k_p$ is the propagation rate constant.\n\nThe experiments differ in their termination mechanisms due to different environmental conditions:\n\n- **Experiment A**: The reaction is conducted in a system where termination occurs predominantly through the reaction of radicals with a fixed component of the apparatus (e.g., the container wall).
