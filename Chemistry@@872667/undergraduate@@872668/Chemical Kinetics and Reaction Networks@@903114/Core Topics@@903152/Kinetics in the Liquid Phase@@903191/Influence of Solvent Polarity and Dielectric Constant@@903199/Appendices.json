Understanding this relationship is crucial for choosing appropriate solvents to accelerate reactions and control outcomes.", "problem": "Consider a bimolecular reaction in solution where two neutral, nonpolar reactant molecules, A and B, combine to form a neutral product, P. Through computational modeling, it has been determined that the reaction proceeds through a single transition state, denoted as $[A \\cdots B]^{\\ddagger}$, which is highly polar and possesses a large dipole moment.\n\nAn experiment is designed to measure the initial rate of this reaction under identical concentration and temperature conditions in two different solvents:\n1.  Tetrahydrofuran (THF), a solvent with a dielectric constant $\\epsilon \\approx 7.5$.\n2.  Acetonitrile (ACN), a solvent with a dielectric constant $\\epsilon \\approx 37.5$.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly predicts the relative reaction rates and provides the correct physical justification?\n\nA. The rate will be significantly faster in THF because a less polar solvent better accommodates the nonpolar reactants, leading to a higher effective concentration.\nB. The rate will be significantly faster in ACN because the more polar solvent preferentially stabilizes the polar transition state, lowering the overall activation energy.\nC. The rate will be significantly slower in ACN because the polar solvent will strongly solvate and create a \"solvent cage\" around the nonpolar reactants, which inhibits their ability to collide effectively.\nD. The rates will be approximately the same in both solvents because the reactants and products are both neutral, meaning the overall thermodynamics of the reaction are independent of solvent polarity.\nE. The rate will be significantly slower in ACN because the stabilization of the transition state by the polar solvent makes it a kinetic trap, slowing its conversion to product.", "solution": "We compare initial rates under identical concentrations and temperature, so the relative rates are determined by the bimolecular rate constant.

The alternatives are incorrect for the following reasons: option A appeals to a higher effective concentration without addressing the activation barrier; option C invokes a solvent cage hindering nonpolar reactants in a polar solvent, which is not the dominant effect compared to strong stabilization of the highly polar transition state; option D confuses thermodynamics with kinetics, since the rate depends on the activation free energy, not just on reactant and product neutrality; option E incorrectly treats the transition state as a kinetically trapped intermediate, whereas stabilizing the transition state lowers the barrier and accelerates the reaction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1489719"}, {"introduction": "While a solvent's dielectric constant gives a good measure of its bulk polarity, it doesn't capture specific, directed interactions like hydrogen bonding.
