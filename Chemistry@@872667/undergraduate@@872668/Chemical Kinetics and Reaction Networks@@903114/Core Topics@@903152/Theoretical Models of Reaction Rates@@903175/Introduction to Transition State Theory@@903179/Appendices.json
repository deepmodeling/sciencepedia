In Reaction I, the reaction coordinate corresponds to a translational degree of freedom of the reactants that is converted into a vibrational degree of freedom in the product. In Reaction II, the reaction coordinate is an internal vibrational or torsional degree of freedom of the reactant molecule.\n\nB. In both Reaction I and Reaction II, the reaction coordinate is described by the stretching of a single, specific chemical bond.\n\nC. The potential energy surface for Reaction I lacks a well-defined saddle point, making the reaction coordinate arbitrary, whereas the surface for Reaction II has a distinct saddle point defining the reaction coordinate.\n\nD. For Reaction I, the reaction coordinate involves the conversion of a rotational degree of freedom into a translational one. For Reaction II, it involves the conversion of a vibrational degree of freedom into a rotational one.\n\nE. The reaction coordinate for Reaction I is defined by the change in the electronic energy levels as the atoms approach, while the reaction coordinate for Reaction II is defined solely by changes in nuclear positions on a single electronic potential energy surface.", "solution": "According to Transition State Theory (TST), nuclear motion proceeds on a single Born–Oppenheimer potential energy surface (PES) along a minimum-energy path (MEP). The reaction coordinate, denoted by $s$, parameterizes this path and aligns with the unstable normal mode at the transition state (TS), which is a first-order saddle point where the Hessian has exactly one negative eigenvalue. A TST dividing surface is placed orthogonal to $s$ at the TS (or, in variational TST, at the location along $s$ that minimizes the rate).\n\nFor Reaction I (bimolecular association), consider two atoms with nuclear positions $\\mathbf{r}_{\\text{X}}$ and $\\mathbf{r}_{\\text{Y}}$. Introduce the center-of-mass coordinate $\\mathbf{R}_{\\text{cm}}$ and the relative coordinate $\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{r}_{\\text{Y}}-\\mathbf{r}_{\\text{X}}$ with $r=|\\mathbf{r}|$ and reduced mass $\\mu$. The nuclear kinetic energy separates as\n$$\nT=\\frac{\\mathbf{P}_{\\text{cm}}^{2}}{2M}+\\frac{\\mathbf{p}_{r}^{2}}{2\\mu},\n$$\nand the PES depends primarily on $r$, i.e., $V=V(r)$, for the approach and bond formation. Far apart, the degree of freedom $r$ represents relative translational motion of two free atoms. As the atoms approach, the same coordinate $r$ becomes the bond-stretch coordinate of the nascent diatomic. Near the product minimum at $r=r_{e}$, one introduces the vibrational normal coordinate $q=r-r_{e}$, and the motion is vibrational. Thus, the reaction coordinate for association is essentially the radial approach coordinate $s\\sim r$, which represents conversion of relative translational motion into the internal vibrational motion of the bond in the product. In many atom–atom associations the ground-state PES may be barrierless (no stationary saddle on $V$), but TST remains applicable via a variational dividing surface located along $r$; the coordinate is not arbitrary but determined by the MEP and the free-energy bottleneck.\n\nFor Reaction II (unimolecular isomerization of a non-linear molecule), the overall translational and rotational motions are separable, and internal motion spans the $3N-6$ vibrational degrees of freedom. The reaction coordinate is an internal generalized coordinate, typically a torsional angle or a concerted vibrational mode, along which the molecule passes over a first-order saddle (transition structure). Denote a torsional coordinate by $\\phi$ with a barrier $V(\\phi)$; the TS is at $\\phi=\\phi^{\\ddagger}$ and the reaction coordinate $s\\sim \\phi$ is purely intramolecular (vibrational/torsional), not a translational DOF.\n\nThese TST principles directly assess the options:\n- Option A correctly states that, for Reaction I, the reaction coordinate corresponds to a relative translational DOF that becomes a vibrational bond-stretch in the product, while for Reaction II it is an internal vibrational/torsional DOF of the reactant.\n- Option B is incorrect because isomerization typically proceeds via torsion or angle bending rather than stretching a single specific bond.\n- Option C is incorrect because, although association can be barrierless on $V(r)$, the reaction coordinate is not arbitrary; variational TST defines a physically meaningful dividing surface, and some associations can have saddles depending on the PES.\n- Option D incorrectly asserts conversions between rotational and translational (and vibrational) DOFs that are not the defining feature of the reaction coordinate in TST for these processes.\n- Option E is incorrect because, within the Born–Oppenheimer framework, both reactions are described by nuclear motion on a single electronic PES; the reaction coordinate is not defined by changes in electronic energy levels per se, but by nuclear motion on that PES.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental distinction is given by Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1492821"}, {"introduction": "The rate in TST is determined by a statistical comparison of the transition state to the reactants, quantified by the ratio of their partition functions.
