The standard form of a linear equation is $y = mx + c$, where $m$ is the slope and $c$ is the y-intercept.\n\n**Step 1: Linearization of the Freundlich Isotherm**\nThe Freundlich isotherm equation is given as:\n$$q_e = K_F C_e^{1/n}$$\nTo linearize this equation, we can take the natural logarithm ($\\ln$) of both sides:\n$$\\ln(q_e) = \\ln(K_F C_e^{1/n})$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, $\\ln(ab) = \\ln(a) + \\ln(b)$ and $\\ln(x^y) = y\\ln(x)$, we can expand the right side:\n$$\\ln(q_e) = \\ln(K_F) + \\ln(C_e^{1/n})$$\n$$\\ln(q_e) = \\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right) \\ln(C_e) + \\ln(K_F)$$\nThis equation is in the form of a straight line, $y = mx + c$.

A plot of $\\ln(q_e)$ versus $\\ln(C_e)$ is linear.\n2. A plot of $q_e$ versus $\\ln(C_e)$ is non-linear.\n\nComparing these findings with our analysis:\n- The first finding (linear plot of $\\ln(q_e)$ vs. $\\ln(C_e)$) matches the linearized form of the Freundlich isotherm.\n- The second finding (non-linear plot of $q_e$ vs. $\\ln(C_e)$) refutes the Temkin isotherm model, as this model predicts a linear relationship for such a plot.\n\nTherefore, the experimental data is described by the Freundlich isotherm. This eliminates options A and C, which are based on the Temkin model.\n\n**Step 4: Parameter Determination**\nNow we must determine the value of the parameter from the slope. The problem states that the slope of the linear plot of $\\ln(q_e)$ versus $\\ln(C_e)$ is 0.457.\nFrom our linearization of the Freundlich model in Step 1, we identified the slope of this plot as the heterogeneity factor, $m = 1/n$.\nThus, we have:\n$$\\frac{1}{n} = 0.457$$\nThis value is a dimensionless exponent.\n\n**Step 5: Final Option Selection**\nWe can now evaluate the remaining options:\n- Option B: \"The process follows the Freundlich isotherm, and the heterogeneity factor $1/n$ is 0.457.\" This matches our conclusions perfectly.\n- Option D: \"The process follows the Freundlich isotherm, and the capacity constant $K_F$ is 0.457.\" This is incorrect. The slope corresponds to the exponent $1/n$, not the capacity constant $K_F$. $K_F$ is related to the y-intercept of the plot.\n\nSo, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1525238"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate test of any model is its ability to accurately describe experimental data.
