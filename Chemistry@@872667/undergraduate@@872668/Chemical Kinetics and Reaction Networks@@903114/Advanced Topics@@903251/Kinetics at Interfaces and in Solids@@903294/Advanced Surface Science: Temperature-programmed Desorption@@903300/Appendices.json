This constant temperature induces the contaminant molecules to desorb from the surface.\n\nThe UHV chamber is continuously evacuated by a high-capacity pump. The partial pressure of the desorbed contaminant in the chamber is monitored by a mass spectrometer. It is observed that, after a brief initial transient, the partial pressure of the contaminant decays exponentially over time. This behavior is consistent with first-order desorption kinetics, where the rate of desorption is directly proportional to the surface coverage of the contaminant. For this analysis, you can assume that the measured partial pressure is directly proportional to the instantaneous rate of desorption from the surface.\n\nYou are given the following experimental data and constants:\n- The constant temperature of the substrate is $T = 600 \\text{ K}$.\n- The pre-exponential factor, or attempt frequency, for the desorption process is $\\nu = 1.0 \\times 10^{13} \\text{ s}^{-1}$.\n- At time $t_1 = 10.0 \\text{ s}$ into the exponential decay phase, the measured partial pressure of the contaminant is $P_1 = 5.40 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ Torr}$.\n- At a later time $t_2 = 30.0 \\text{ s}$, the partial pressure has decreased to $P_2 = 1.25 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ Torr}$.\n- The molar gas constant is $R = 8.314 \\text{ J mol}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1}$.\n\nBased on this information, calculate the molar activation energy for desorption, $E_d$, of the contaminant from the silicon surface.

This yields two peaks or a main peak with a pronounced shoulder.\n\nThis behavior is incompatible with a single sharp peak without interactions (rejects A), with net-attraction-driven shifts to lower temperature and sharpening (rejects B), with a single peak shifting monotonically to higher temperature at higher coverage under purely repulsive interactions (rejects D, which contradicts the given net repulsion at full monolayer that lowers $E_{act}$), and with a broad, coverage-insensitive peak (rejects E).
