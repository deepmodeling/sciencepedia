So, we set $\\lambda = 0$:\n$$ 0 = p - 3 \\pm \\sqrt{p - 1} $$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$ 3 - p = \\pm \\sqrt{p - 1} $$\nThis gives us two separate cases to solve.\n\nCase 1: $3 - p = + \\sqrt{p - 1}$\nFor this equation to have a real solution, the left side must be non-negative, since the square root on the right side is defined to be non-negative.\n$$ 3 - p \\ge 0 \\implies p \\le 3 $$\nCombining this with our initial constraint $p \\ge 1$, any solution from this case must lie in the interval $1 \\le p \\le 3$.\nNow, we can square both sides of the equation:\n$$ (3 - p)^2 = (\\sqrt{p - 1})^2 $$\n$$ 9 - 6p + p^2 = p - 1 $$\nRearranging the terms to form a standard quadratic equation $ap^2+bp+c=0$:\n$$ p^2 - 7p + 10 = 0 $$\nWe can solve this quadratic equation by factoring:\n$$ (p - 2)(p - 5) = 0 $$\nThe potential solutions are $p = 2$ and $p = 5$. We must check these against the constraint for this case, which is $1 \\le p \\le 3$. The value $p = 2$ satisfies this constraint, but $p = 5$ does not. Thus, $p=2$ is a valid bifurcation point from this case.\n\nCase 2: $3 - p = - \\sqrt{p - 1}$\nFor this equation to have a real solution, the left side must be non-positive.\n$$ 3 - p \\le 0 \\implies p \\ge 3 $$\nCombining this with our initial constraint $p \\ge 1$, any solution from this case must satisfy $p \\ge 3$.\nNow, we square both sides of the equation.
