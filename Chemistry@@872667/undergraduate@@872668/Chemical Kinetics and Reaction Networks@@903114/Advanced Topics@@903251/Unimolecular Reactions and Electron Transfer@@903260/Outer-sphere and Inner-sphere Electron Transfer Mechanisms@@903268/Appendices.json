{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding the mechanism of an electron transfer reaction is paramount to controlling and predicting chemical reactivity. A fundamental question is whether the reaction proceeds through a direct, bridged inner-sphere pathway or a non-contact outer-sphere pathway. This practice guides you through a classic problem in mechanistic inorganic chemistry, where you will use experimental clues—specifically the identity of the final products and the known substitution labilities of the metal centers—to deduce the operating mechanism. By analyzing the fate of a potential bridging ligand, you will see how product analysis provides a definitive signature for the inner-sphere pathway [@problem_id:1501895].", "problem": "A kinetics study is performed on the redox reaction between the cobalt(III) complex $[\\text{Co(NH}_3)_5(\\text{DMSO})]^{3+}$ and the chromium(II) complex $[\\text{Cr(H}_2\\text{O)}_6]^{2+}$ in an aqueous solution. Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) is a ligand that can coordinate to a metal center through its oxygen atom.\n\nKey experimental observations are as follows:\n1.  The overall redox reaction is observed to proceed very rapidly.\n2.  Analysis of the reaction mixture after completion shows that the only chromium-containing product is the complex $[\\text{Cr(H}_2\\text{O)}_5(\\text{DMSO})]^{3+}$.\n\nFor the purpose of your analysis, recall the general rules for ligand substitution lability for these octahedral metal centers:\n-   Co(III) ($d^6$, low-spin) complexes are substitutionally inert.\n-   Cr(II) ($d^4$, high-spin) complexes are substitutionally labile.\n-   Cr(III) ($d^3$) complexes are substitutionally inert.\n\nBased on the provided experimental evidence and lability rules, select the option that correctly identifies the dominant electron transfer mechanism and provides the correct reasoning.\n\nA. The mechanism is inner-sphere with a water molecule from the chromium complex acting as the bridge. This is inferred from the rapid reaction rate, as water is readily available on the labile Cr(II) center to form a bridge.\n\nB. The mechanism is outer-sphere. The electron tunnels between the two complexes without the formation of a covalent bridge, and the final chromium product forms through subsequent ligand substitution.\n\nC. The mechanism is inner-sphere with the DMSO ligand acting as the bridge. This is confirmed by the identity of the final chromium product, which is inert and thus \"traps\" the transferred bridging ligand in its coordination sphere.\n\nD. The mechanism is a two-step process where the DMSO ligand first dissociates from the inert Co(III) complex, followed by a rapid inner-sphere reaction between the resulting $[\\text{Co(NH}_3)_5(\\text{H}_2\\text{O})]^{3+}$ and $[\\text{Cr(H}_2\\text{O)}_6]^{2+}$.", "solution": "We identify the redox partners and their substitutional labilities. The oxidant is $[\\text{Co(NH}_{3})_{5}(\\text{DMSO})]^{3+}$ with Co(III), which is a low-spin $d^{6}$, substitutionally inert center. The reductant is $[\\text{Cr(H}_{2}\\text{O})_{6}]^{2+}$ with Cr(II), which is a high-spin $d^{4}$, substitutionally labile center. Upon electron transfer, Cr(II) is oxidized to Cr(III) (a $d^{3}$, substitutionally inert center), and Co(III) is reduced to Co(II). The key experimental observation is that, after the reaction, the only chromium-containing product is $[\\text{Cr(H}_{2}\\text{O})_{5}(\\text{DMSO})]^{3+}$.\n\nInner-sphere electron transfer involves formation of a covalent bridge between the two metal centers via a ligand that can coordinate both metals; electron transfer then occurs through this bridge. A well-established diagnostic for inner-sphere pathways is “ligand transfer”: the bridging ligand frequently ends up bound to the product metal that becomes inert after the redox event, effectively trapping that ligand. In contrast, outer-sphere electron transfer proceeds without any covalent bridge and thus does not inherently transfer ligands between coordination spheres.\n\nDMSO, bound to Co(III) through oxygen, is capable of acting as a bridging ligand between Co(III) and Cr(II) because the oxygen donor can simultaneously coordinate the labile Cr(II). Formation of a bridged intermediate can be written schematically as\n$$[\\text{Co(NH}_{3})_{5}(\\text{DMSO})]^{3+} + [\\text{Cr(H}_{2}\\text{O})_{6}]^{2+} \\rightleftharpoons [\\text{Cr(H}_{2}\\text{O})_{5}(\\mu\\text{-DMSO})\\text{Co(NH}_{3})_{5}]^{5+} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O},$$\nwhere $\\mu\\text{-DMSO}$ denotes DMSO bridging both metals. Electron transfer through this bridge rapidly converts Cr(II) to Cr(III) and Co(III) to Co(II). Because Cr(III) is substitutionally inert ($d^{3}$), it traps the bridging ligand, yielding the observed chromium product:\n$$[\\text{Cr(H}_{2}\\text{O})_{5}(\\mu\\text{-DMSO})\\text{Co(NH}_{3})_{5}]^{5+} \\rightarrow [\\text{Cr(H}_{2}\\text{O})_{5}(\\text{DMSO})]^{3+} + [\\text{Co(NH}_{3})_{5}]^{2+}.$$\nThus, the identity of the chromium product, $[\\text{Cr(H}_{2}\\text{O})_{5}(\\text{DMSO})]^{3+}$, directly evidences that DMSO served as the bridging ligand during the electron transfer and was subsequently trapped on inert Cr(III). This is the classic signature of an inner-sphere mechanism with ligand transfer.\n\nWe now evaluate the options:\n\n- Option A (water bridge) is inconsistent with the product identity. If water were the bridging ligand, the post-ET trapping on inert Cr(III) would not selectively produce $[\\text{Cr(H}_{2}\\text{O})_{5}(\\text{DMSO})]^{3+}$; instead, there would be no reason to transfer DMSO to Cr(III) during the ET step.\n\n- Option B (outer-sphere) is inconsistent with ligand transfer. Outer-sphere ET does not form a covalent bridge, so DMSO would not be transferred during ET. Any subsequent substitution to place DMSO on Cr(III) would have to occur on Cr(III), which is substitutionally inert, and thus would be very slow and unlikely to account for the exclusive, rapid formation of $[\\text{Cr(H}_{2}\\text{O})_{5}(\\text{DMSO})]^{3+}$.\n\n- Option D (initial DMSO dissociation from Co(III)) contradicts the inertness of Co(III) complexes; dissociation from $[\\text{Co(NH}_{3})_{5}(\\text{DMSO})]^{3+}$ would be slow and would not explain the observed rapid reaction. Moreover, it does not account for the selective trapping of DMSO on Cr(III), which is best explained by an inner-sphere bridge involving DMSO.\n\nTherefore, the dominant electron transfer mechanism is inner-sphere with DMSO as the bridging ligand, and the trapping of DMSO on inert Cr(III) confirms this pathway.\n\nHence the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1501895"}, {"introduction": "Once a reaction is identified as outer-sphere, the next challenge is to understand and predict its rate.
