This is quantified by the Flux Control Coefficient (FCC). For an enzyme $E_i$ and the steady-state flux $J$ of a metabolic pathway, the FCC, denoted $C_i^J$, is defined as the fractional change in flux in response to a fractional change in the concentration or activity of that specific enzyme.

A research team performs a series of experiments to characterize the control structure of this pathway. In each separate experiment, they use genetic tools to increase the concentration of a single enzyme by exactly $5.0\\%$ relative to its baseline level, while keeping the concentrations of all other enzymes constant. They then measure the resulting percentage increase in the steady-state flux $J$ of the final product.

Metabolic Control Analysis provides a framework for understanding how the flux is controlled by the different components of the system. The flux-control coefficient of an enzyme $E_i$, denoted $C_{E_i}^J$, quantifies the fractional change in the steady-state flux $J$ that results from a small fractional change in the concentration or activity of that enzyme. A fundamental property of these coefficients is the summation theorem, which states that for any such pathway, the sum of all flux-control coefficients is unity: $C_{E_1}^J + C_{E_2}^J + C_{E_3}^J = 1$.\n\nInitially, the pathway is operating under certain conditions where all three enzymes exert some degree of control over the flux (i.e., all $C_{E_i}^J  0$). Then, a substance is added to the system that is a specific competitive inhibitor for enzyme $E_2$. This inhibitor does not interact with $E_1$ or $E_3$. The system is allowed to reach a new steady state, which, as expected, has a lower overall flux $J'$.\n\nBased on the principles of enzyme kinetics and metabolic control, which of the following statements most accurately describes the change in the flux-control coefficients from their initial values to their new values in the inhibited state?\n\nA. $C_{E_2}^J$ decreases, while $C_{E_1}^J$ and $C_{E_3}^J$ both increase.\n\nB. $C_{E_2}^J$ increases, while $C_{E_1}^J$ and $C_{E_3}^J$ both decrease.\n\nC.

By continuity, for any nonzero specific inhibition of $E_{2}$ one has an increase in the control exerted by $E_{2}$ relative to its initial value:\n$$\nC_{E_{2}}^{J'}C_{E_{2}}^{J}.\n$$\nBecause the summation theorem must still hold at the new steady state and the coefficients in this simple unbranched pathway are positive, an increase in $C_{E_{2}}^{J'}$ necessarily requires a decrease in the sum $C_{E_{1}}^{J'}+C_{E_{3}}^{J'}$ compared to $C_{E_{1}}^{J}+C_{E_{3}}^{J}$. Physically, inhibition of $E_{2}$ causes accumulation of $A$ and depletion of $B$, making the flux increasingly constrained at step $E_{2}$ and reducing the ability of changes in $E_{1}$ or $E_{3}$ to alter the overall flux. Therefore both $C_{E_{1}}^{J}$ and $C_{E_{3}}^{J}$ decrease.\n\nOptions C and D violate the summation theorem (the sum cannot be less than or greater than $1$ if all three decrease or increase simultaneously). Option E also violates the summation theorem because increasing $C_{E_{2}}^{J}$ with the others unchanged would make the sum exceed $1$. Between A and B, only B is consistent with the step becoming more rate-limiting, so $C_{E_{2}}^{J}$ must increase, not decrease.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that $C_{E_{2}}^{J}$ increases, while $C_{E_{1}}^{J}$ and $C_{E_{3}}^{J}$ both decrease.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1486953"}, {"introduction": "A key goal of Metabolic Control Analysis is to create predictive frameworks that connect local molecular interactions to systemic behavior.
