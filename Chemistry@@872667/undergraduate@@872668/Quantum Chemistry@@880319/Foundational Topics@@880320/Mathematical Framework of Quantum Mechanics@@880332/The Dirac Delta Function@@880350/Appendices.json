A bound state is defined as a stationary state with energy $E  0$ whose wavefunction is normalizable.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate physical reason why this potential cannot support any bound states?\n\nA. The uncertainty principle dictates that a particle localized by the infinitely narrow potential must have an infinite kinetic energy, which always exceeds any possible binding energy.\n\nB. A bound state in a symmetric potential must have definite parity (be either a purely even or purely odd function). An odd wavefunction must be zero at the origin, $\\psi(0)=0$, which is a trivial solution, and an even wavefunction cannot satisfy the boundary conditions imposed by a repulsive potential.\n\nC. The time-independent Schrödinger equation requires a discontinuity (a \"kink\") in the slope of the wavefunction at the delta-function's location. For a repulsive potential ($\\alpha  0$), this kink always bends the wavefunction away from the axis, making it impossible for the wavefunction to decay to zero at both positive and negative infinity.\n\nD. Bound states can only exist if the energy of the particle is less than the minimum value of the potential. Since the minimum of the potential $V(x)$ is zero (for all $x \\neq 0$), no state can have an energy $E  0$.\n\nE. For any potential, the ground state wavefunction must be nodeless.

Hence no bound state exists for $\\alpha0$.\n\nPhysically, the decisive reason is that the delta potential imposes a discontinuity in the slope of $\\psi$ whose sign is fixed by $\\alpha$.
