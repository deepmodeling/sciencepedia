The statement is fundamentally incorrect because its primary assertion is false.\n\nThus, statement B is **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The probability of measuring the eigenvalue associated with $\\phi_{1}$ in this basis is $0.36$.**\n\nAccording to the postulates of quantum mechanics, if a system is in a normalized state $\\Psi = \\sum_{n} c_{n}\\phi_{n}$, where $\\{\\phi_{n}\\}$ are the orthonormal eigenfunctions of an observable, the probability $P_{k}$ of measuring the eigenvalue corresponding to the eigenfunction $\\phi_{k}$ is given by the modulus squared of the corresponding coefficient, $P_{k} = |c_{k}|^2$.\nThe state is $\\Psi = 0.6\\,\\phi_{1} + 0.8\\,i\\,\\phi_{2}$. We have already confirmed it is normalized.\nThe coefficient for the eigenfunction $\\phi_{1}$ is $c_{1} = 0.6$.\nThe probability of measuring the eigenvalue associated with $\\phi_{1}$ is:\n$$\nP_{1} = |c_{1}|^2 = |0.6|^2 = 0.36\n$$\nThis matches the value given in the statement.\n\nThus, statement C is **Correct**.\n\n**D. The relative phase $i$ in the coefficient of $\\phi_{2}$ changes the measurement probabilities in the $\\{\\phi_{1}, \\phi_{2}\\}$ basis.**\n\nThe measurement probabilities in the $\\{\\phi_{1}, \\phi_{2}\\}$ basis are given by $P_{1} = |c_{1}|^2$ and $P_{2} = |c_{2}|^2$.\nLet's analyze these probabilities for the given state:\n$P_{1} = |c_{1}|^2 = |0.6|^2 = 0.36$.\n$P_{2} = |c_{2}|^2 = |0.8\\,i|^2 = 0.64$.\n\nNow, consider a state $\\Psi'$ where the relative phase is different, for example, by removing the factor of $i$: $\\Psi' = 0.6\\,\\phi_{1} + 0.8\\,\\phi_{2}$. The coefficients are $c'_{1} = 0.6$ and $c'_{2} = 0.8$.\nThe new probabilities would be:\n$P'_{1} = |c'_{1}|^2 = |0.6|^2 = 0.36$.\n$P'_{2} = |c'_{2}|^2 = |0.8|^2 = 0.64$.\nThe probabilities $P_{1} = P'_{1}$ and $P_{2} = P'_{2}$ are unchanged. In general, for any phase factor $e^{i\\theta}$, the modulus squared is $|c e^{i\\theta}|^2 = |c|^2 |e^{i\\theta}|^2 = |c|^2 \\cdot 1 = |c|^2$. The phase of a coefficient does not affect the probability of measuring the system in the corresponding eigenstate of the basis in which the state is expanded. The relative phase is irrelevant for measurement probabilities *in this specific basis*.\n\nThus, statement D is **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. The expectation value of any observable that is diagonal in the $\\{\\phi_{1}, \\phi_{2}\\}$ basis is independent of the relative phase between the coefficients, whereas the expectation value of an observable with nonzero off-diagonal matrix elements between $\\phi_{1}$ and $\\phi_{2}$ may depend on that relative phase.**\n\nLet $\\hat{O}$ be a Hermitian operator representing an observable.

The expectation value becomes:\n$$\n\\langle \\hat{O} \\rangle = |c_{1}|^2 O_{11} + |c_{2}|^2 O_{22}\n$$\nThis expression depends only on the moduli of the coefficients, $|c_{1}|^2$ and $|c_{2}|^2$, and is therefore independent of their phases, including their relative phase. The first part of the statement is correct.\n\nCase 2: $\\hat{O}$ has nonzero off-diagonal matrix elements.\nThe expectation value includes the terms $c_{1}^*c_{2}O_{12} + c_{2}^*c_{1}O_{21}$. Since $\\hat{O}$ is Hermitian, $O_{21} = O_{12}^*$. The expression can be written as:\n$$\n\\langle \\hat{O} \\rangle = |c_{1}|^2 O_{11} + |c_{2}|^2 O_{22} + c_{1}^*c_{2}O_{12} + (c_{1}^*c_{2}O_{12})^* = |c_{1}|^2 O_{11} + |c_{2}|^2 O_{22} + 2\\,\\text{Re}(c_{1}^*c_{2}O_{12})\n$$\nLet's write the coefficients in polar form: $c_{1} = |c_{1}|e^{i\\theta_{1}}$ and $c_{2} = |c_{2}|e^{i\\theta_{2}}$. The product $c_{1}^*c_{2} = |c_{1}||c_{2}|e^{i(\\theta_{2}-\\theta_{1})}$. The term $2\\,\\text{Re}(c_{1}^*c_{2}O_{12})$ explicitly depends on the relative phase $\\Delta\\theta = \\theta_{2}-\\theta_{1}$. As long as $c_{1}$, $c_{2}$, and $O_{12}$ are non-zero, this term is generally non-zero and phase-dependent. Thus, the expectation value depends on the relative phase. The second part of the statement is correct.\n\nBoth parts of the statement are correct. This is a fundamental principle distinguishing coherent superpositions from classical mixtures.\n\nThus, statement E is **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "2467249"}]}
