The atom is initially held at rest and is then released at time $t=0$ inside a tall, evacuated vacuum chamber. It subsequently falls freely under the influence of a uniform gravitational field, which imparts a constant downward acceleration $g$. To understand the wave-like properties of the falling atom, which are crucial for the interferometer's operation, it is necessary to determine its de Broglie wavelength. Assuming the atom's speed remains much less than the speed of light, derive an expression for its de Broglie wavelength, $\\lambda$, as a function of the time $t$ that has elapsed since its release. Your final expression should be in terms of $m$, $g$, $t$, and Planck's constant, $h$.", "solution": "The atom is released from rest at $t=0$ and falls under a uniform gravitational field with constant acceleration $g$.
