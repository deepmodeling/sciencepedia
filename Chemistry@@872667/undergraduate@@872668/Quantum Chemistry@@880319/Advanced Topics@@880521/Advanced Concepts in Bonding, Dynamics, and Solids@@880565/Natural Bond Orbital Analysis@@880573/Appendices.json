After performing a calculation, the student runs a Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis to understand the nature of the chemical bond between the two atoms. The NBO analysis transforms the complex molecular orbitals into a more intuitive picture of localized bonds and lone pairs. For the primary bonding orbital between lithium (atom 1) and hydrogen (atom 2), the program provides the following output snippet:\n\n```\n(1.98765) BD (1) Li 1 - H 2\n          ( 12.34%)   0.3513*Li 1 s(100.00%)\n          ( 87.66%)   0.9363*H  2 s(100.00%)\n```\n\nHere, `BD (1)` refers to the first bonding orbital, `(1.98765)` is its electron occupation, the percentages `(12.34%)` and `(87.66%)` represent the contribution of each atom's orbital to the bond, and the numerical values `0.3513` and `0.9363` are the coefficients of the respective atomic orbitals in the linear combination that forms the bond.\n\nBased exclusively on the NBO data provided, which of the following statements most accurately describes the polarity of the Li–H bond?\n\nA. The bond is polarized towards Hydrogen, as indicated by Hydrogen's larger percentage contribution (87.66%) to the bonding orbital.\nB. The bond is polarized towards Lithium, because as the atom with the smaller coefficient (0.3513), it attracts the electron density more strongly.\nC. The bond is essentially nonpolar, because the bonding orbital is formed from pure s-orbitals on both atoms, indicating symmetric sharing.\nD. The bond is polarized towards Lithium, because the analysis lists the Lithium atom first in the `Li 1 - H 2` designation.\nE.

Therefore, the bond is polarized toward hydrogen.\n\nThis directly rules out the alternatives:\n- The smaller coefficient on lithium does not imply stronger attraction of electron density; rather, it indicates a smaller contribution to the bonding NBO, so option B is incorrect.\n- The fact that both basis functions are $s$-type does not imply nonpolarity; the highly unequal weights demonstrate polarity, so option C is incorrect.\n- The listing order “Li 1 – H 2” is purely nominative and not indicative of polarity, so option D is incorrect.\n- The NBO contributions themselves provide sufficient information about the direction of bond polarization; one does not need external electronegativity values to conclude the direction from these data, so option E is incorrect.\n\nHence, the correct statement is that the bond is polarized toward hydrogen due to its much larger contribution to the bonding orbital.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1383438"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simple interpretation, NBO analysis allows us to assign precise, quantitative values to classical bonding concepts like hybridization.

It is a sound, well-posed, and objective question rooted in established principles of computational chemistry. A solution will now be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe core of the Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) method is to find the most faithful representation of the molecular wavefunction in terms of a classic Lewis structure, which consists of localized $1$-center lone pairs ($n$) and $2$-center bonds ($\\sigma$ or $\\pi$). The \"best\" Lewis structure is defined as the one that maximizes the total electron occupancy in these localized NBOs. For main-group elements, NBO analysis strongly adheres to the octet rule.\n\nFor phosphorus pentachloride, $\\text{PCl}_5$, a Lewis structure with five $2c$–$2e$ covalent bonds to the central phosphorus atom would assign $10$ valence electrons to it, a formal violation of the octet rule. The NBO algorithm will therefore reject such a \"hypervalent\" structure as the primary natural Lewis structure. Instead, it will search for a resonance structure that satisfies the octet rule for all atoms.\n\nFor $\\text{PCl}_5$, this is achieved by postulating an ionic structure. The NBO procedure will find that the Lewis structure with the highest occupancy is one where the phosphorus atom forms four covalent bonds and one of the chlorines exists as an anion, $\\text{Cl}^-$. This leads to a charge-separated resonance form of the type $\\text{PCl}_4^+ \\text{Cl}^-$. In this picture, the phosphorus atom in the $\\text{PCl}_4^+$ cation formally bears a $+1$ charge and satisfies the octet rule with four bonds.\n\nThe observed trigonal bipyramidal geometry with five P–Cl contacts is then recovered by considering strong electronic delocalization, which NBO treats as a perturbation on the idealized Lewis structure. These are donor-acceptor interactions. The most significant delocalization involves the formally non-bonded axial chloride anion. A lone pair NBO on this axial chloride, $n(\\text{Cl}_\\text{ax})$, acts as a strong donor into the empty antibonding NBO of the phosphorus-chlorine bond on the opposite side of the molecule, $\\sigma^*(\\text{P–Cl}_\\text{ax})$. This powerful $n \\to \\sigma^*$ interaction is energetically very significant (often calculated to be > 50 kcal/mol). This delocalization effectively creates what is known in qualitative molecular orbital theory as a $3$-center–$4$-electron ($3c$–$4e$) bond along the axial Cl–P–Cl axis.\n\nThis model has several key consequences that are hallmarks of the NBO interpretation:\n1.  **Role of $d$-orbitals**: The NBO analysis of $\\text{PCl}_5$ consistently finds that the total occupancy of the phosphorus $3d$ orbitals is extremely small (typically on the order of $0.01$–$0.05$ electrons). NBO theory thus concludes that $d$-orbitals play no significant role in the bonding of main-group hypercoordinate molecules. The older $sp^3d$ hybridization model is explicitly refuted.\n2.  **Bond differentiation**: The equatorial P–Cl bonds are described as fairly conventional, albeit highly polarized, $2c$–$2e$ covalent $\\sigma$ bonds. The axial P–Cl bonds, however, are a result of the $3c$–$4e$ interaction. This fundamental difference in bonding character explains why axial bonds are experimentally observed to be longer and weaker than equatorial bonds.\n3.  **Charge Distribution**: The underlying ionic Lewis structure and the high electronegativity of chlorine result in a significant calculated charge separation. The natural atomic charge on phosphorus is strongly positive, and the charges on the chlorines are negative.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option based on this framework.\n\n**A. NBO favors a hypervalent Lewis structure with five equivalent $2c$–$2e$ P–Cl bonds formed by strong $\\mathrm{P}\\,3d$ participation (i.e., $sp^3d$ hybridization), with natural charges near zero and negligible donor–acceptor delocalization.**\nThis statement describes the outdated valence bond model invoking $sp^3d$ hybridization. It is diametrically opposed to the NBO interpretation. NBO rejects the hypervalent Lewis structure, finds negligible $\\mathrm{P}\\,3d$ participation, predicts significant charge separation, and relies on strong donor–acceptor delocalization to explain the bonding.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. NBO favors a charge-separated Lewis structure dominated by the $\\mathrm{PCl_4^+\\,Cl^-}$ resonance form that preserves an octet at phosphorus in the Lewis picture; hypervalency is expressed primarily through donor–acceptor interactions $n(\\mathrm{Cl_{ax}})\\to \\sigma^\\ast(\\mathrm{P–Cl})$ that impart $3c$–$4e$ character to the axial region, with negligible $\\mathrm{P}\\,3d$ occupancy; axial $\\mathrm{P–Cl}$ bonds are longer and weaker than equatorial.**\nThis statement accurately summarizes the entire NBO model for $\\text{PCl}_5$. It correctly identifies: (1) the preference for an octet-satisfying ionic Lewis structure ($\\text{PCl}_4^+\\text{Cl}^-$), (2) the mechanism of hypervalency via $n \\to \\sigma^*$ donor-acceptor interactions, (3) the resulting $3c$–$4e$ character of the axial system, (4) the conclusion of negligible $\\mathrm{P}\\,3d$ occupancy, and (5) the structural consequence that axial bonds are distinct from (longer and weaker than) equatorial bonds.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. NBO identifies no recognizable $2c$–$2e$ bonds in $\\mathrm{PCl_5}$, instead assigning a metallic-like, six-center electron cloud delocalized over all atoms, with no significant polarization or charge separation.**\nThis is a description more akin to a fully delocalized molecular orbital picture for a metallic system. The NBO method is fundamentally based on finding a localized Lewis structure, and it successfully identifies three strong $2c$–$2e$ bonds in the equatorial plane. It also predicts very significant charge separation, not its absence.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. NBO assigns five $2c$–$2e$ P–Cl bonds using only $\\mathrm{P}\\,3s$ and $\\mathrm{P}\\,3p$ hybrids (no $\\mathrm{P}\\,3d$), finds axial and equatorial bonds exactly equivalent, and detects no significant charge separation or donor–acceptor delocalization.**\nThis statement is internally contradictory and factually wrong from an NBO perspective. One cannot form five orthogonal localized bonds from only four atomic orbitals ($s+p_x+p_y+p_z$). Furthermore, NBO does not find five $2c$–$2e$ bonds as its primary structure, it does not find the bonds to be equivalent, and it finds both charge separation and donor-acceptor interactions to be critically important.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2459207"}]}
