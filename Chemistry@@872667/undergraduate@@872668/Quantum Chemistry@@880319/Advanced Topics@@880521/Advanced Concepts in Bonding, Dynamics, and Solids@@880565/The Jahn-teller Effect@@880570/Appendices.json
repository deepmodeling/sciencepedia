In octahedral complexes, electronic degeneracy arises from uneven occupancy within the $e_{g}$ or $t_{2g}$ sets. Distortions associated with $e_{g}$ degeneracy couple directly to the axial metal-ligand bonds and are typically strongest; $t_{2g}$-based degeneracies generally lead to weaker effects.\n\nFor each complex, determine the metal oxidation state, the $d^n$ count, the spin state, and the octahedral electron configuration using the crystal field splitting into $t_{2g}$ and $e_{g}$ orbitals.\n\nA. $[Fe(CN)_{6}]^{4-}$: Each $CN^{-}$ contributes charge $-1$, so $6(-1)+x=-4$ gives $x=+2$. Thus Fe is $Fe^{2+}$ with $d^{6}$. Given low-spin, the configuration is $t_{2g}^{6} e_{g}^{0}$. This is orbitally nondegenerate (no electrons in $e_{g}$ and a filled $t_{2g}$), so no first-order Jahn-Teller distortion.\n\nB. $[Mn(H_{2}O)_{6}]^{2+}$: $Mn^{2+}$ is $d^{5}$. With weak-field $H_{2}O$ and high-spin, the configuration is $t_{2g}^{3} e_{g}^{2}$ with one electron in each $e_{g}$ orbital. This yields an orbitally nondegenerate ground term, so no significant first-order Jahn-Teller effect (only very weak second-order effects, if any).\n\nC. $[Cr(H_{2}O)_{6}]^{2+}$: $Cr^{2+}$ is $d^{4}$. With weak-field $H_{2}O$ and high-spin, the configuration is $t_{2g}^{3} e_{g}^{1}$.

For an octahedral $d^{8}$ complex, the configuration is $t_{2g}^{6} e_{g}^{2}$.

Building on the previous exercise, this problem explores the important distinction between strong and weak distortions.

In octahedral complexes, the strongest Jahn-Teller distortions arise when the $e_{g}$ set is unevenly occupied (e.g., $e_{g}^{1}$ or $e_{g}^{3}$), because $e_{g}$ orbitals ($d_{z^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$) point directly at ligands and are strongly antibonding. This typically leads to a significant tetragonal elongation or compression.\n\nFor the high-spin $d^{7}$ case, the $e_{g}$ set is evenly occupied with one electron in each $e_{g}$ orbital, so there is no first-order Jahn-Teller driving force from the $e_{g}$ manifold. However, the $t_{2g}^{5}$ configuration is orbitally degenerate in the $t_{2g}$ set (equivalently, it can be viewed as $t_{2g}^{1}$ with a hole), which can produce a Jahn-Teller effect. Because $t_{2g}$ orbitals do not point directly at ligands and are less antibonding, the associated Jahn-Teller distortion is typically weak. The usual outcome is a slight tetragonal distortion (elongation or compression) along a four-fold axis that lifts the residual $t_{2g}$-derived degeneracy:\n$$\nO_{h} \\to D_{4h}, \\quad t_{2g} \\to b_{2g} + e_{g}, \\quad e_{g} \\to a_{1g} + b_{1g}.\n$$\nThus, a weak geometric distortion is expected rather than a strong distortion, a perfect octahedron, a wholesale rearrangement to trigonal prismatic geometry, or a spin-state change (especially since water is a weak-field ligand favoring high spin).\n\nTherefore, the correct expectation is a weak Jahn-Teller distortion with slight elongation or compression along a four-fold axis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2294593"}, {"introduction": "To truly understand the Jahn-Teller effect, we must look beyond electron counting and consider the fundamental role of symmetry.
