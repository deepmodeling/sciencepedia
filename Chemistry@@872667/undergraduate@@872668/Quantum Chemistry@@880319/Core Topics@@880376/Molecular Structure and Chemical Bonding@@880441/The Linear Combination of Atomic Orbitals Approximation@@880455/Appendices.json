It is scientifically grounded in the principles of Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals-Molecular Orbital (LCAO-MO) theory, a standard approximation in quantum chemistry. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information, including the atomic species, electron configuration, and the specific energy ordering of molecular orbitals, to determine a unique, meaningful answer. The premises are objective and consistent. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe task is to determine the bond order of the dicarbon molecule, $\\mathrm{C}_{2}$.\nFirst, we establish the number of valence electrons to be placed in the molecular orbitals. A neutral carbon atom ($\\mathrm{C}$) has the atomic electron configuration $1s^{2} 2s^{2} 2p^{2}$. The valence electrons are those in the $n=2$ shell. Therefore, each carbon atom contributes $2+2=4$ valence electrons. For the diatomic molecule $\\mathrm{C}_{2}$, the total number of valence electrons is $2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n\nNext, we fill the valence molecular orbitals with these $8$ electrons according to the Aufbau principle, the Pauli exclusion principle, and Hund's rule, using the provided energy ordering:\n$$\n\\sigma_{2s} < \\sigma^{*}_{2s} < \\pi_{2p_{x}} = \\pi_{2p_{y}} < \\sigma_{2p_{z}} < \\pi^{*}_{2p_{x}} = \\pi^{*}_{2p_{y}} < \\sigma^{*}_{2p_{z}}\n$$\nFollowing this order:\n$1$. The $\\sigma_{2s}$ bonding orbital is filled with $2$ electrons.\n$2$. The $\\sigma^{*}_{2s}$ antibonding orbital is filled with $2$ electrons.\n$3$. The degenerate $\\pi_{2p_{x}}$ and $\\pi_{2p_{y}}$ bonding orbitals are filled next. We have $8 - 2 - 2 = 4$ electrons remaining. These $4$ electrons will completely fill the two $\\pi_{2p}$ orbitals.\n\nThe resulting ground-state valence electron configuration for $\\mathrm{C}_{2}$ is:\n$$\n(\\sigma_{2s})^{2} (\\sigma^{*}_{2s})^{2} (\\pi_{2p_{x}})^{2} (\\pi_{2p_{y}})^{2} \\quad \\text{or, more compactly,} \\quad (\\sigma_{2s})^{2} (\\sigma^{*}_{2s})^{2} (\\pi_{2p})^{4}\n$$\nThe bond order is defined as one-half the difference between the number of electrons in bonding orbitals ($N_{b}$) and the number of electrons in antibonding orbitals ($N_{a}$):\n$$\n\\text{Bond Order} = \\frac{1}{2} (N_{b} - N_{a})\n$$\nFrom the electron configuration, we count the bonding and antibonding electrons:\n- Electrons in bonding orbitals ($\\sigma_{2s}$, $\\pi_{2p_{x}}$, $\\pi_{2p_{y}}$): $N_{b} = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6$.\n- Electrons in antibonding orbitals ($\\sigma^{*}_{2s}$): $N_{a} = 2$.\n- The higher-energy orbitals ($\\sigma_{2p_{z}}$, $\\pi^{*}_{2p}$, $\\sigma^{*}_{2p_{z}}$) are unoccupied.\n\nSubstituting these values into the bond order formula:\n$$\n\\text{Bond Order} = \\frac{1}{2} (6 - 2) = \\frac{1}{2} (4) = 2\n$$\nThe bond order of $\\mathrm{C}_{2}$ is $2$.\n\nThe problem also requires a brief qualitative explanation for the strong double bond character. A bond order of $2$ corresponds to a double bond. The composition of this bond is noteworthy. The contribution from the $2s$-derived orbitals involves $2$ bonding electrons in $\\sigma_{2s}$ and $2$ antibonding electrons in $\\sigma^{*}_{2s}$, resulting in a net bond order contribution of $\\frac{1}{2} (2 - 2) = 0$. The entire bonding interaction arises from the $p$-orbitals. Specifically, there are $4$ electrons in the $\\pi_{2p}$ bonding orbitals and $0$ electrons in the $\\sigma_{2p_{z}}$ bonding orbital and any $2p$-derived antibonding orbitals. The bond order contribution from the $2p$ shell is therefore $\\frac{1}{2}(4-0) = 2$. This indicates that the double bond in $\\mathrm{C}_{2}$ is composed of two $\\pi$ bonds, with no net $\\sigma$ bond contribution. The presence of two full bonding $\\pi$ orbitals results in a strong covalent interaction, classifying it as a double bond, despite the unusual absence of a net $\\sigma$ component which is typically present in double bonds (e.g., in ethene, $\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{4}$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2465017"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simple diatomic molecules, we can apply the LCAO approximation to larger, delocalized $\\pi$ systems using the simplified Hückel method.

I will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe solution requires solving the secular equation for the $\\pi$ system of the allyl cation. The LCAO-MO approximation leads to the generalized eigenvalue problem $Hc = ESc$, where $H$ is the Hamiltonian matrix, $S$ is the overlap matrix, $c$ is the vector of coefficients for a molecular orbital, and $E$ is the energy of that orbital. For a non-trivial solution, the secular determinant must be zero: $\\det(H-ES) = 0$.\n\nGiven the problem's specifications for the three-carbon allyl system, the Hamiltonian matrix $H$ and overlap matrix $S$ are:\n$$\nH = \\begin{pmatrix} H_{11} & H_{12} & H_{13} \\\\ H_{21} & H_{22} & H_{23} \\\\ H_{31} & H_{32} & H_{33} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha & \\beta & 0 \\\\ \\beta & \\alpha & \\beta \\\\ 0 & \\beta & \\alpha \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nS = \\begin{pmatrix} S_{11} & S_{12} & S_{13} \\\\ S_{21} & S_{22} & S_{23} \\\\ S_{31} & S_{32} & S_{33} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = I\n$$\nThe secular determinant $D(E) = \\det(H-ES)$ is therefore:\n$$\nD(E) = \\det(H-EI) = \\left| \\begin{matrix} \\alpha-E & \\beta & 0 \\\\ \\beta & \\alpha-E & \\beta \\\\ 0 & \\beta & \\alpha-E \\end{matrix} \\right|\n$$\nWe compute this determinant using cofactor expansion along the first row:\n$$\nD(E) = (\\alpha-E) \\left| \\begin{matrix} \\alpha-E & \\beta \\\\ \\beta & \\alpha-E \\end{matrix} \\right| - \\beta \\left| \\begin{matrix} \\beta & \\beta \\\\ 0 & \\alpha-E \\end{matrix} \\right| + 0\n$$\n$$\nD(E) = (\\alpha-E) [(\\alpha-E)^2 - \\beta^2] - \\beta [\\beta(\\alpha-E) - 0]\n$$\n$$\nD(E) = (\\alpha-E)^3 - \\beta^2(\\alpha-E) - \\beta^2(\\alpha-E)\n$$\n$$\nD(E) = (\\alpha-E)^3 - 2\\beta^2(\\alpha-E)\n$$\nThis is the explicit expression for the secular determinant as a function of $E$, $\\alpha$, and $\\beta$.\n\nTo find the energy eigenvalues, we solve $D(E)=0$:\n$$\n(\\alpha-E)[(\\alpha-E)^2 - 2\\beta^2] = 0\n$$\nThis yields three energy levels:\n$1$. $\\alpha-E = 0 \\implies E_2 = \\alpha$\n$2$. $(\\alpha-E)^2 = 2\\beta^2 \\implies \\alpha-E = \\pm\\sqrt{2}\\beta \\implies E = \\alpha \\mp \\sqrt{2}\\beta$\n\nSince the electronic interaction term $\\beta$ is negative, the energy levels in increasing order are:\n$E_1 = \\alpha + \\sqrt{2}\\beta$ (bonding)\n$E_2 = \\alpha$ (non-bonding)\n$E_3 = \\alpha - \\sqrt{2}\\beta$ (anti-bonding)\n\nThe allyl radical has $3$ $\\pi$ electrons. According to the Aufbau principle, two electrons occupy the lowest energy orbital $\\psi_1$ (with energy $E_1$), and one electron occupies the next orbital $\\psi_2$ (with energy $E_2$). Thus, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the allyl radical is the non-bonding molecular orbital (NBMO), $\\psi_2$.\n\nThe problem states the allyl cation is formed by removing one electron from the allyl radical. This electron is removed from the HOMO of the radical, which is $\\psi_2$. We must find the coefficients of this orbital. Let the coefficient vector be $c_2 = (c_{21}, c_{22}, c_{23})^T$.

From equation (2), we find $c_{21} + c_{23} = 0$, or $c_{21} = -c_{23}$.\nThe un-normalized coefficient vector is of the form $(c, 0, -c)^T$ for some constant $c$. To find $c$, we apply the normalization condition for an orthonormal basis:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{3} |c_{2i}|^2 = 1\n$$\n$$\n|c_{21}|^2 + |c_{22}|^2 + |c_{23}|^2 = 1\n$$\n$$\n|c|^2 + |0|^2 + |-c|^2 = 1\n$$\n$$\n2|c|^2 = 1 \\implies |c| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nBy convention, we can choose the real positive value, $c = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. The normalized coefficients for the non-bonding orbital $\\psi_2$ are:\n$c_{21} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$, $c_{22} = 0$, $c_{23} = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nThe problem states that the positive charge created upon ionization is distributed proportionally to the squared absolute values of the coefficients of the removed molecular orbital, $\\psi_2$. The fraction of charge on carbon atom $i$, denoted $q_i$, is given by $|c_{2i}|^2$, since the sum of these squared coefficients is already normalized to $1$.\n- Charge on carbon $1$: $q_1 = |c_{21}|^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- Charge on the central carbon $2$: $q_2 = |c_{22}|^2 = (0)^2 = 0$.\n- Charge on carbon $3$: $q_3 = |c_{23}|^2 = \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe total charge is $q_1 + q_2 + q_3 = \\frac{1}{2} + 0 + \\frac{1}{2} = 1$, which is correct for a $+1$ cation.\nThe question asks for the fraction of the total positive charge located on the central carbon atom.
