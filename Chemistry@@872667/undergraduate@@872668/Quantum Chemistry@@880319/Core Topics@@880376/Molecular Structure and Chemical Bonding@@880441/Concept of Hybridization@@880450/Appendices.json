The traditional valence bond model for its octahedral geometry invokes $sp^3d^2$ hybridization on the central sulfur atom. However, modern computational and theoretical considerations favor a model that does not require the participation of energetically unfavorable d-orbitals.

The model that excludes d-orbitals predicts a significant partial positive charge on the central sulfur atom and partial negative charges on the fluorine atoms, an outcome that aligns better with experimental observations of bond polarity than the more covalent picture implied by $sp^3d^2$ hybridization.\n\nB. In the three-center, four-electron (3c-4e) model applied to a linear F-S-F fragment, the four valence electrons occupy two bonding molecular orbitals. This distribution results in a total of two bonds within the F-S-F unit, making each S-F interaction equivalent to a full single bond.\n\nC.

A primary objection to the $sp^3d^2$ hybridization model for sulfur is based on the large energy difference between the sulfur $3s/3p$ valence orbitals and the $3d$ orbitals, which would lead to poor orbital overlap with fluorine's 2p orbitals and result in weak, energetically unfavorable bonds.\n\nE. A significant flaw in applying the three-center, four-electron bond concept to $\\mathrm{SF_6}$ is that it inherently predicts two distinct types of S-F bonds (e.g., two axial and four equatorial), which contradicts the experimental fact that all six bonds are identical.\n\nF. The most compelling experimental evidence favoring $sp^3d^2$ hybridization over the 3c-4e model comes from X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), which definitively shows an energy level corresponding to the occupation of sulfur $3d$ orbitals.\n\nSelect all the statements that are correct.", "solution": "We compare the traditional $sp^{3}d^{2}$ hybridization picture with the modern description that avoids sulfur $3d$ participation and instead uses three mutually orthogonal three-center, four-electron (3c-4e) bonds, each spanning a linear $\\mathrm{F\\!-\\!S\\!-\\!F}$ unit along one of the Cartesian axes in the octahedron.\n\nA. In the modern picture, hypervalent bonding arises from delocalized three-center interactions and significant ionic character, with electron density polarized toward the highly electronegative fluorine ligands. Population analyses and electrostatic potential maps indicate that sulfur bears a substantial partial positive charge, while fluorine atoms bear partial negative charges.

For a linear $\\mathrm{F\\!-\\!S\\!-\\!F}$ fragment treated by the 3c-4e model, the relevant collinear $p$-type orbitals combine to yield three molecular orbitals: one bonding, one nonbonding, and one antibonding. With four electrons, the bonding orbital is doubly occupied and the nonbonding orbital is doubly occupied, while the antibonding orbital is empty. Thus there are not “two bonding molecular orbitals” occupied. The net bond order across the three-center framework is one, shared over two $\\mathrm{S\\!-\\!F}$ contacts, giving approximately one-half per $\\mathrm{S\\!-\\!F}$ from this framework alone, not a full single bond per contact. Therefore B is incorrect.\n\nC. Both models successfully account for the observed octahedral geometry with six equivalent $\\mathrm{S\\!-\\!F}$ bonds: the $sp^{3}d^{2}$ model by invoking six equivalent hybrids arranged octahedrally, and the 3c-4e picture by arranging three mutually orthogonal linear $\\mathrm{F\\!-\\!S\\!-\\!F}$ units, which generates an octahedral array and equivalent bonds. Therefore C is correct.\n\nD. A principal objection to invoking $sp^{3}d^{2}$ hybridization for third-row main-group centers is the large energy gap and radial mismatch between sulfur $3s/3p$ valence orbitals and sulfur $3d$ orbitals, together with poor overlap between sulfur $3d$ and fluorine $2p$ orbitals. This makes substantial $3d$ participation energetically and overlap-wise unfavorable. Therefore D is correct.\n\nE. The 3c-4e bonding description for $\\mathrm{SF_{6}}$ uses three orthogonal $\\mathrm{F\\!-\\!S\\!-\\!F}$ units and inherently produces an octahedral geometry with all six $\\mathrm{S\\!-\\!F}$ bonds equivalent; it does not require or predict distinct axial versus equatorial bonds (that distinction pertains to trigonal bipyramidal geometries such as in $\\mathrm{SF_{4}}$).
