We are interested in the interaction between two identical, normalized atomic orbitals, which are real-valued functions. Let these orbitals be denoted as $\\psi_A$ and $\\psi_B$, centered on nucleus A and nucleus B, respectively. The overlap integral, $S$, which quantifies the extent to which these two orbitals occupy the same region of space, is defined by the three-dimensional integral over all space:\n$$S(R) = \\int \\psi_A \\psi_B \\, d\\tau$$\nwhere $d\\tau$ is the volume element.\n\nAssuming the orbitals remain normalized for any separation distance, determine the exact value of the overlap integral $S$ in the limiting case where the two nuclei coalesce, that is, in the limit as the internuclear distance $R$ approaches zero.", "solution": "The problem asks for the limiting value of the overlap integral $S(R)$ as the internuclear distance $R$ approaches zero. The overlap integral is defined as:\n$$S(R) = \\int \\psi_A \\psi_B \\, d\\tau$$\nwhere $\\psi_A$ and $\\psi_B$ are identical, normalized atomic orbitals centered on nuclei A and B, respectively. We need to evaluate:\n$$ \\lim_{R \\to 0} S(R) = \\lim_{R \\to 0} \\int \\psi_A \\psi_B \\, d\\tau $$\n\nLet's analyze the physical and mathematical meaning of the limit $R \\to 0$. As the internuclear distance $R$ approaches zero, the nucleus B, on which the orbital $\\psi_B$ is centered, moves to the same position as nucleus A.\n\nSince the orbitals $\\psi_A$ and $\\psi_B$ are stated to be identical in their functional form (e.g., both are 1s orbitals), the only difference between them is the location of their center. When the centers coincide (as $R \\to 0$), the two functions become identical at every point in space. In other words, the function $\\psi_B$ becomes the function $\\psi_A$.\nMathematically, for any point in space described by a position vector $\\vec{r}$, we have:\n$$ \\lim_{R \\to 0} \\psi_B(\\vec{r}) = \\psi_A(\\vec{r}) $$\n\nWe can now substitute this into our limit expression. Assuming the integrand behaves well enough to allow the interchange of the limit and the integral, we get:\n$$ \\lim_{R \\to 0} S(R) = \\int \\left( \\lim_{R \\to 0} (\\psi_A \\psi_B) \\right) \\, d\\tau $$\nSince $\\psi_A$ does not depend on the internuclear distance $R$, and $\\psi_B \\to \\psi_A$ as $R \\to 0$, the expression inside the integral becomes:\n$$ \\lim_{R \\to 0} (\\psi_A \\psi_B) = \\psi_A \\left( \\lim_{R \\to 0} \\psi_B \\right) = \\psi_A \\psi_A = (\\psi_A)^2 $$\nTherefore, the limit of the overlap integral is:\n$$ \\lim_{R \\to 0} S(R) = \\int (\\psi_A)^2 \\, d\\tau $$\nSince the problem states that the orbitals are real-valued, $(\\psi_A)^2$ is equivalent to $\\psi_A^* \\psi_A$. So the integral is:\n$$ \\int \\psi_A^* \\psi_A \\, d\\tau $$\nThis integral has a fundamental physical meaning: it is the normalization integral for the wavefunction $\\psi_A$. It represents the total probability of finding the particle described by $\\psi_A$ somewhere in all of space.\n\nThe problem statement explicitly specifies that the orbitals are *normalized*. By the definition of normalization for a wavefunction, this integral must be equal to 1.\n$$ \\int \\psi_A^* \\psi_A \\, d\\tau = 1 $$\nThus, the limiting value of the overlap integral as the internuclear distance approaches zero is 1.
