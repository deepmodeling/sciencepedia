The bond in ClF is more covalent than the bond in ICl because the energy difference between the valence p-orbitals of Cl and F is larger, indicating stronger orbital interaction.\n\nB. The bond in ClF is more covalent than the bond in ICl because the participating atomic orbitals (n=2 for F, n=3 for Cl) are closer in principal quantum number than those in ICl (n=3 for Cl, n=5 for I), which enhances overlap.\n\nC.

The bond in ICl is more covalent than the bond in ClF because iodine is a significantly larger atom, allowing for more diffuse orbitals that overlap more effectively to form a covalent bond.\n\nE.

This practice explores the famous case of boron trihalide Lewis acidity, where orbital energy and size matching explain why the observed trend contradicts expectations from electronegativity alone, introducing the critical concept of $\\pi$-backbonding [@problem_id:2010767].", "problem": "A Lewis acid is a chemical species that is capable of accepting an electron pair from a Lewis base. The strength of a Lewis acid is often correlated with the electron deficiency of the central atom. In the case of boron trihalides, $\\text{BX}_3$, the boron atom is electron-deficient and acts as the Lewis acidic center.\n\nBased on the principle of electronegativity and inductive effects, one would predict the order of Lewis acidity. Fluorine is the most electronegative element, and chlorine is less electronegative than fluorine. This suggests that the boron atom in $\\text{BF}_3$ should be more electron-deficient than in $\\text{BCl}_3$, and thus one would predict that $\\text{BF}_3$ should be a stronger Lewis acid. However, experimental studies of the heats of formation of adducts with various Lewis bases consistently show that the Lewis acidity follows the trend $\\text{BCl}_3 > \\text{BF}_3$.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and comprehensive explanation for this observed discrepancy?\n\nA. The high electronegativity of fluorine in $\\text{BF}_3$ makes the boron atom significantly more electron-deficient than in $\\text{BCl}_3$. This renders $\\text{BF}_3$ a stronger Lewis acid, and the experimental results are considered anomalous exceptions to general chemical principles.\n\nB. The chlorine atoms in $\\text{BCl}_3$ are significantly larger than the fluorine atoms in $\\text{BF}_3$. The greater steric hindrance around the boron center in $\\text{BCl}_3$ makes it more difficult for a Lewis base to approach, thus making $\\text{BF}_3$ the stronger Lewis acid.\n\nC. The boron atom in a $\\text{BX}_3$ molecule has a vacant p-orbital. The halogen's non-bonding electron pairs can be donated back into this orbital, a phenomenon called $\\pi$-backbonding. This back-donation is more effective between the 2p orbital of boron and the 2p orbital of fluorine ($\\text{BF}_3$) than between the 2p orbital of boron and the 3p orbital of chlorine ($\\text{BCl}_3$) due to better orbital size and energy matching. This more effective back-donation in $\\text{BF}_3$ reduces its boron's electron deficiency more significantly, making it a weaker Lewis acid than $\\text{BCl}_3$.\n\nD. The B-Cl bond is longer and requires less energy to break than the B-F bond. The energetic cost of rehybridizing the boron from $sp^2$ to $sp^3$ upon forming an adduct is therefore lower for $\\text{BCl}_3$ than for $\\text{BF}_3$, making the overall adduct formation more favorable for $\\text{BCl}_3$.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the definition of a Lewis acid: a species that accepts an electron pair into a low-lying empty orbital. In $\\text{BX}_3$, the boron center has an empty $2p$ orbital and is trigonal planar with $sp^2$ hybridization, making it an electron-pair acceptor. A naive inductive argument compares the $\\sigma$-withdrawing power of halogens: since fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine, one would predict that $\\text{BF}_3$ withdraws more electron density from boron via the $\\sigma$-framework, rendering boron more electron-deficient and thus $\\text{BF}_3$ a stronger Lewis acid than $\\text{BCl}_3$. This predicts an incorrect order.\n\nTo resolve this, we must include $\\pi$-backbonding. In $\\text{BX}_3$, the halogen atom has lone pairs in $p$ orbitals that can overlap with the empty $2p$ orbital on boron, donating electron density back into boron. This is $\\pi$-backdonation, and it reduces the net electron deficiency at boron. The effectiveness of this donation depends on orbital size and energy matching, which determine the overlap integral\n$$\nS=\\int \\phi_{2p}^{\\mathrm{B}}(\\mathbf{r})\\,\\phi_{np}^{\\mathrm{X}}(\\mathbf{r})\\,d\\tau,\n$$\nand on the energy gap between donor and acceptor orbitals. For $\\text{BF}_3$, the donor is a fluorine $2p$ lone pair interacting with a boron $2p$ acceptor; both are $2p$, so their radial extent and energy match are good, giving larger $S$ and stronger $\\pi$-backbonding. For $\\text{BCl}_3$, the donor is a chlorine $3p$ lone pair interacting with boron $2p$; the mismatch in principal quantum number reduces overlap and worsens energy matching, giving smaller $S$ and weaker $\\pi$-backbonding.\n\nConsequently, the back-donation in $\\text{BF}_3$ substantially reduces the effective electron deficiency at boron and imparts partial multiple-bond character to B–F, lowering the Lewis acidity. In $\\text{BCl}_3$, back-donation is much less effective, leaving boron more electron-deficient and thus a stronger Lewis acid. This explains the observed experimental trend that adduct formation is more favorable for $\\text{BCl}_3$ than for $\\text{BF}_3$.\n\nAlternative statements do not account for the key effect: (i) Option A contradicts consistent thermochemical data and ignores $\\pi$-backbonding. (ii) Option B invokes sterics in the wrong direction: larger chlorine would, if anything, hinder adduct formation and decrease Lewis acidity, contrary to observation. (iii) Option D focuses on bond length and rehybridization energy; while such factors may contribute, they do not provide the primary, general explanation for the reversed acidity order across $\\text{BX}_3$; the dominant effect is the differing $\\pi$-backbonding due to $2p$–$2p$ versus $2p$–$3p$ interactions.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and comprehensive explanation is that stronger $\\pi$-backbonding in $\\text{BF}_3$ reduces its Lewis acidity relative to $\\text{BCl}_3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2010767"}]}
