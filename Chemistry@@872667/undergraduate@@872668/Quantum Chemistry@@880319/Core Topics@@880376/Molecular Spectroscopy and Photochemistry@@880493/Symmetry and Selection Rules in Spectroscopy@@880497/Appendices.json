The study begins with a pure sample of water, $\\mathrm{H_2O}$.

Both $\\mathrm{H_2O}$ and $\\mathrm{HDO}$ molecules are known to have a bent, non-linear geometry.

The point group is lowered from $C_{2v}$ to $C_1$, and the number of IR-active fundamental vibrations remains 3.", "solution": "We begin by determining the point group of the molecules. For $\\mathrm{H_{2}O}$, the molecule is bent and planar with two identical $\\mathrm{H}$ atoms. The symmetry operations are the identity $E$, a twofold rotation $C_{2}$ about an axis perpendicular to the molecular plane and passing through O, and two mirror planes $\\sigma_{v}$: one is the molecular plane itself, and the other is perpendicular to the molecular plane and bisects the $\\angle\\mathrm{HOH}$. These operations define the point group $C_{2v}$.\n\nUpon isotopic substitution to form $\\mathrm{HDO}$, the $\\mathrm{H}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ atoms are no longer equivalent. Any symmetry operation that exchanges the two hydrogens in $\\mathrm{H_{2}O}$ is no longer valid for $\\mathrm{HDO}$. Specifically, the $C_{2}$ rotation and the perpendicular mirror plane $\\sigma_{v}$ that would swap $\\mathrm{H}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ cease to be symmetries. However, the molecular plane remains a mirror plane because all atoms lie in that plane and are not exchanged under reflection in it. Therefore, the remaining symmetry operations are $E$ and the molecular plane $\\sigma$, which corresponds to the point group $C_{s}$. Thus, the point group is lowered from $C_{2v}$ to $C_{s}$.\n\nNext, we determine the number of fundamental vibrational modes. For a non-linear molecule with $N$ atoms, the number of vibrational degrees of freedom is\n$$\n3N-6.\n$$\nBoth $\\mathrm{H_{2}O}$ and $\\mathrm{HDO}$ are non-linear triatomic molecules with $N=3$, so\n$$\n3N-6=3\\times 3-6=3.\n$$\nIsotopic substitution does not change $N$ or the non-linearity of the molecule; hence the total number of fundamental vibrational modes remains $3$.\n\nWe now assess IR activity. The IR selection rule is that a vibrational mode is IR-active if its normal coordinate transforms as one of the Cartesian components of the dipole moment vector $(\\mu_{x},\\mu_{y},\\mu_{z})$, equivalently as $(x,y,z)$ under the point group.\n\nFor $\\mathrm{H_{2}O}$ in $C_{2v}$, the Cartesian components transform as $A_{1}$ for $z$, $B_{1}$ for $x$, and $B_{2}$ for $y$. The three normal modes of $\\mathrm{H_{2}O}$ have symmetries $A_{1}$ (symmetric stretch), $A_{1}$ (bend), and $B_{2}$ (asymmetric stretch), all of which correspond to $x$, $y$, or $z$ and are therefore IR-active. Hence $\\mathrm{H_{2}O}$ has $3$ IR-active fundamentals.\n\nFor $\\mathrm{HDO}$ in $C_{s}$, the irreducible representations are $A'$ (in-plane) and $A''$ (out-of-plane). The dipole components transform as $x,y\\to A'$ and $z\\to A''$, so both $A'$ and $A''$ are IR-active. Since the total number of fundamentals is still $3$, and there is no IR-inactive representation in $C_{s}$, all three fundamentals in $\\mathrm{HDO}$ are IR-active as well.\n\nTherefore, the isotopic substitution $\\mathrm{H_{2}O}\\to\\mathrm{HDO}$ lowers the point group from $C_{2v}$ to $C_{s}$, but the number of IR-active fundamental vibrations remains $3$.\n\nThis corresponds to option A and rules out the others: C is false because the point group does not remain $C_{2v}$ when $\\mathrm{H}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are inequivalent; D is false because $3N-6$ is unchanged; B is false because the number of IR-active modes does not decrease; E is false because a mirror plane remains, so the point group is not $C_{1}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1399688"}, {"introduction": "Beyond predicting whether transitions are allowed, a deeper understanding comes from constructing the molecular orbitals themselves in a way that respects molecular symmetry.
