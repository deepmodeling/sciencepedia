A key descriptor of a multi-electron atomic state is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, denoted by the symbol $L$. This quantum number arises from the vector coupling of the orbital angular momenta of the individual electrons. For any atom, the value of $L$ for a given electronic state is determined almost exclusively by the electrons in its outermost, partially-filled subshells, as completed subshells contribute nothing to the total orbital angular momentum.\n\nConsider a neutral Silicon (Si) atom in its ground electronic state. The electron configuration for Si is $1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^2$. Based on the established principles for determining the ground state of multi-electron atoms, calculate the value of the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, $L$.", "solution": "The closed subshells $1s^{2}$, $2s^{2}$, $2p^{6}$, and $3s^{2}$ contribute no net orbital angular momentum, so only the two electrons in the partially filled $3p$ subshell determine $L$.
