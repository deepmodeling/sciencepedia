The spin magnetic quantum number, $m_s$, specifies the projection of the particle's spin angular momentum onto a given axis (conventionally the z-axis, aligned with the external magnetic field).\n\nFor a particle with a spin quantum number $s$, the allowed values of $m_s$ are integers or half-integers ranging from $-s$ to $+s$ in integer steps. The set of possible $m_s$ values is given by:\n$$m_s = -s, -s+1, \\dots, s-1, s$$\n\nThe total number of these distinct values for $m_s$ represents the multiplicity of the spin state.

The number of states is given by the difference between the maximum and minimum values, plus one:\n$$\\text{Number of states} = (s) - (-s) + 1 = 2s + 1$$\n\nIn the experiment described, the beam of axions splits into four distinct sub-beams. Each sub-beam corresponds to a unique value of $m_s$, meaning there are four possible spin orientation states. Therefore, the number of states is 4.\n\nWe can now set the theoretical expression for the number of states equal to the experimentally observed number of states:\n$$2s + 1 = 4$$\n\nNow, we solve this equation for $s$:\n$$2s = 4 - 1$$\n$$2s = 3$$\n$$s = \\frac{3}{2}$$\n\nThus, the spin quantum number for the axion is $3/2$.
