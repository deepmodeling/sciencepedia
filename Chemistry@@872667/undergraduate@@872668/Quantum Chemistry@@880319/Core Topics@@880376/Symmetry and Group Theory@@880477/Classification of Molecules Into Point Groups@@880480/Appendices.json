For the purpose of symmetry analysis, its geometry can be described within a Cartesian coordinate system as follows:\n\nThe two boron (B) atoms and four 'terminal' hydrogen (H) atoms are all located in the $yz$-plane. The geometric center of the molecule is at the origin $(0,0,0)$. The two boron atoms lie on the $z$-axis, positioned symmetrically with respect to the origin.

This swaps the bridging H at $(\\pm a,0,0)$, leaves boron positions invariant as a set, and maps terminal H in the $yz$-plane to symmetry-equivalent positions. Hence $C_{2}(z)$ exists.\n- About the $x$-axis: $C_{2}(x)$ is $(x,y,z)\\mapsto(x,-y,-z)$. This interchanges the two boron atoms, maps terminal H appropriately within the $yz$-plane, and leaves each bridging H fixed (since $y=z=0$). Hence $C_{2}(x)$ exists.\n- About the $y$-axis: $C_{2}(y)$ is $(x,y,z)\\mapsto(-x,y,-z)$. This swaps the bridging H and interchanges the two boron atoms while mapping terminal H to symmetry-equivalent positions. Hence $C_{2}(y)$ exists.\nTherefore, there are three mutually perpendicular $C_{2}$ axes: $C_{2}(x)$, $C_{2}(y)$, and $C_{2}(z)$.\n\n3) Identify mirror planes:\n- The $yz$-plane reflection $\\sigma_{yz}$ is $(x,y,z)\\mapsto(-x,y,z)$. This swaps the two bridging H at $(\\pm a,0,0)$ and leaves all atoms in the $yz$-plane unchanged. Hence $\\sigma_{yz}$ exists.\n- The $xz$-plane reflection $\\sigma_{xz}$ is $(x,y,z)\\mapsto(x,-y,z)$. This reflects the terminal H pairs (which lie in the $yz$-plane) across $y\\mapsto -y$ and leaves boron and bridging H positions invariant as a set. Hence $\\sigma_{xz}$ exists.\n- Given in the problem, the $xy$-plane reflection $\\sigma_{xy}$ is $(x,y,z)\\mapsto(x,y,-z)$, exchanging the two boron atoms and mapping the terminal sets and bridging H set appropriately.

This operation swaps the two boron atoms $(0,0,\\pm b)$, swaps the bridging hydrogens $(\\pm a,0,0)$, and maps each terminal hydrogen at $(0,y,z)$ to $(0,-y,-z)$, which is present by the described symmetry. Hence an inversion center $i$ exists at the origin.\n\n5) Point group determination:\n- The presence of three mutually perpendicular $C_{2}$ axes together with an inversion center and a mirror plane perpendicular to the chosen principal $C_{2}$ axis (take $z$) identifies the point group as $D_{2h}$.\n- This excludes $C_{2v}$ (only one $C_{2}$ and no inversion), $C_{2h}$ (a single $C_{2}$ with one horizontal mirror only), $D_{2d}$ (no inversion or horizontal mirror), and $T_{d}$ (tetrahedral symmetry, not applicable here).\n\nTherefore, the molecule belongs to the $D_{2h}$ point group.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1358058"}, {"introduction": "We now turn to the world of coordination chemistry with the facial isomer of an octahedral complex.

The line passing through the cobalt center and the centers of the two opposite triangular faces (one of $\\text{NH}_3$ and the other of $\\text{Cl}$) is a $C_{3}$ axis: a rotation by $2\\pi/3$ permutes the three $\\text{NH}_3$ among themselves and the three $\\text{Cl}$ among themselves, leaving the molecule indistinguishable.

Reflection in any such plane exchanges the other two $\\text{NH}_3$ and the other two $\\text{Cl}$, leaving the structure unchanged.

A $\\sigma_{h}$ plane perpendicular to the $C_{3}$ axis would interchange the $\\text{NH}_3$ face with the $\\text{Cl}$ face. Since the ligand types differ, this is not a symmetry; therefore, no $\\sigma_{h}$ is present.\n\nFourth, test for $C_{2}$ axes perpendicular to the $C_{3}$ axis.

An inversion center would map the $\\text{NH}_3$ face to the $\\text{Cl}$ face, which is not allowed, so there is no inversion center.
