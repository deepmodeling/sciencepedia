The reducible representation $\\Gamma_{\\text{H}_{1s}}$ is obtained by evaluating, for each symmetry operation, the trace of the corresponding transformation matrix acting on this basis. For 1s orbitals, which are spherically symmetric, there are no sign changes under any symmetry operation; thus, the character equals the number of basis functions that are left unchanged (mapped onto themselves) by the operation.\n\nFor $E$: All three hydrogen 1s orbitals are unchanged, so the transformation is the $3\\times 3$ identity matrix, and the character is $3$.\n\nFor $2C_{3}$: Each $C_{3}$ rotation (by $120^{\\circ}$ or $240^{\\circ}$) cyclically permutes the three hydrogens, so no orbital is left in place. The corresponding permutation matrix has zero diagonal, hence the character is $0$ for each $C_{3}$.\n\nFor $3\\sigma_{v}$: Each vertical mirror plane contains the principal axis and one N–H bond. Reflection through such a plane leaves the hydrogen lying in that plane fixed and swaps the other two. Therefore, exactly one basis function is unchanged, giving a character of $1$ for each $\\sigma_{v}$.\n\nCollecting these per-class characters in the order $(E, 2C_{3}, 3\\sigma_{v})$ gives $(3, 0, 1)$.
