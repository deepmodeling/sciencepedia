The compound is air-sensitive but known to be soluble in both acetonitrile (ACN) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The supporting electrolyte, tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF$_6$), is also soluble in both solvents. The electrochemist needs to choose a solvent that will allow them to observe the reduction process, which is anticipated to occur at a very negative potential. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate assessment to guide the solvent choice for this specific experiment?\n\nA. Acetonitrile should be chosen because its lower viscosity will result in a larger diffusion-limited current, making the reduction wave easier to detect.\n\nB. Dimethyl sulfoxide should be chosen because its higher dielectric constant will better solvate the supporting electrolyte, completely eliminating any uncompensated resistance.\n\nC. Acetonitrile is preferable because it has a significantly wider electrochemical potential window, especially in the negative direction, compared to dimethyl sulfoxide.\n\nD. Dimethyl sulfoxide is the more suitable choice because it typically provides access to more negative potentials before the solvent itself is reduced, which is crucial for studying reductions, even though its higher viscosity will result in a smaller current signal compared to acetonitrile.\n\nE. Since the analyte and electrolyte are soluble in both, either solvent can be used with identical results, and the choice is merely one of convenience.", "solution": "To choose a solvent for observing a very negative reduction in cyclic voltammetry, the governing considerations are: (i) the electrochemical potential window (especially the cathodic limit before solvent reduction), (ii) the magnitude of the diffusion-limited current (which affects detectability), and (iii) solution resistance and uncompensated resistance effects.\n\nFirst, the electrochemical window is defined by the onset potentials at which the solvent (or supporting electrolyte) undergoes oxidation or reduction. For a reduction process occurring at a very negative potential, the crucial requirement is that the solvent must remain stable to reduction at potentials more negative than the analyte’s reduction potential. Empirically, among common aprotic solvents such as acetonitrile (ACN) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), DMSO typically allows access to more negative cathodic potentials before solvent breakdown than ACN. Therefore, DMSO generally provides a wider cathodic window than ACN, which is decisive when the target reduction is very negative.\n\nSecond, the peak current in a reversible CV is governed (in its scaling) by the Randles–Sevcik relationship,\n$$\ni_{p} \\propto n^{\\frac{3}{2}} F A C \\sqrt{\\frac{v D}{R T}},\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the number of electrons, $F$ is Faraday’s constant, $A$ is electrode area, $C$ is analyte concentration, $v$ is scan rate, $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is temperature, and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. The diffusion coefficient $D$ scales inversely with solvent viscosity $\\eta$ via the Stokes–Einstein relation (for spherical solutes),\n$$\nD \\propto \\frac{k_{B} T}{\\eta r},\n$$\nwith $k_{B}$ the Boltzmann constant and $r$ an effective hydrodynamic radius. Since ACN has a much lower viscosity than DMSO, $D$ is larger in ACN, leading to larger $i_{p}$ in ACN than in DMSO. Thus, statement A is correct in its premise about larger current in ACN but it does not address the dominant constraint: if the solvent reduces before the analyte, the target wave cannot be observed regardless of current magnitude. Hence A is not the most accurate guidance for this experiment.\n\nThird, regarding solution resistance, the potential at the working electrode differs from the potentiostat setpoint due to uncompensated resistance $R_{u}$ via\n$$\nE_{\\text{electrode}} = E_{\\text{applied}} - i R_{u}.\n$$\nA higher dielectric constant generally improves ion dissociation, but it does not eliminate $R_{u}$; moreover, ionic conductivity depends strongly on viscosity and ion mobility, and higher viscosity tends to increase resistance. Therefore, statement B is incorrect: higher dielectric constant in DMSO does not “completely eliminate” uncompensated resistance.\n\nFourth, the claim that ACN has a significantly wider electrochemical potential window “especially in the negative direction” than DMSO (statement C) is not generally accurate; DMSO is typically favored for access to more negative cathodic limits compared to ACN, which is precisely what matters for observing very negative reductions.\n\nFifth, statement E is incorrect because even though both solvents dissolve the analyte and electrolyte, they do not yield identical results: differences in electrochemical window, viscosity (affecting $D$ and thus $i_{p}$), and conductivity lead to different achievable potentials and signal magnitudes.\n\nCombining these principles, the most accurate assessment for selecting a solvent to study a very negative reduction is that DMSO is more suitable due to its typically more negative cathodic limit, even though its higher viscosity reduces the diffusion-limited current compared to ACN.

Using Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), they observe a single-electron redox event. At a scan rate ($\\nu$) of 0.100 V/s, the separation between the anodic and cathodic peak potentials, $\\Delta E_p = |E_{pa} - E_{pc}|$, is measured to be 185 mV at 298 K. This value is significantly larger than the ideal Nernstian value of approximately 59 mV expected for a reversible one-electron process.\n\nTwo hypotheses are proposed to explain this large peak separation:\n1.  **High Uncompensated Resistance:** The combination of solvent viscosity and electrolyte properties results in a substantial uncompensated resistance ($R_u$) in the electrochemical cell.\n2.  **Slow Heterogeneous Kinetics:** The electron transfer process at the electrode surface is kinetically slow, characterized by a small standard rate constant ($k^0$).\n\nTo distinguish between these two effects, the electrochemist performs a series of CV experiments, systematically varying the scan rate $\\nu$ and recording the corresponding peak separation $\\Delta E_p$ and the magnitude of the anodic peak current, $i_p$.\n\nWhich of the following experimental outcomes correctly describes the analytical method that would unambiguously distinguish between the two hypotheses?\n\nA.

We derive the signature dependence of the peak separation on scan rate and peak current for each case, then identify which experiment distinguishes them.\n\nFor a reversible diffusion-controlled couple (no resistance, fast kinetics), the peak separation is independent of the scan rate and equals the well-known Nernstian value for a one-electron process at temperature $T$. The peak current follows the Randles–Sevcik proportionality\n$$\ni_{p} \\propto \\nu^{1/2},\n$$\nfor semi-infinite linear diffusion, where the proportionality constant depends on $n$, $F$, $A$, $C$, $D$, $R$, and $T$.\n\nHypothesis 1 (high uncompensated resistance): Let $R_{u}$ be the uncompensated resistance. The applied (measured) potential differs from the true interfacial potential by the ohmic drop:\n$$\nE_{\\text{meas}} = E_{\\text{true}} + i R_{u}.\n$$\nAt the anodic peak, $i \\approx +|i_{p}|$ and the measured anodic peak potential is shifted positively by approximately $+|i_{p}| R_{u}$.

Hence the measured peak separation increases by approximately\n$$\n\\Delta E_{p,\\text{app}} \\approx \\Delta E_{p,\\text{true}} + 2 |i_{p}| R_{u}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\n\\Delta E_{p,\\text{app}} \\text{ is linear in } |i_{p}| \\quad \\text{with slope } 2 R_{u}.\n$$\nBecause $|i_{p}| \\propto \\nu^{1/2}$ for diffusion control, one also expects\n$$\n\\Delta E_{p,\\text{app}} - \\Delta E_{p,\\text{true}} \\propto \\nu^{1/2}.\n$$\nThus a direct hallmark of ohmic drop is linearity of $\\Delta E_{p}$ versus $i_{p}$, independent of specific mass-transport parameters (the slope gives $2 R_{u}$).\n\nHypothesis 2 (slow heterogeneous kinetics): For quasi-reversible kinetics, the peak separation reflects finite $k^{0}$ via the Nicholson criterion. Define the dimensionless kinetic parameter\n$$\n\\psi = k^{0} \\left(\\frac{\\pi D n F \\nu}{R T}\\right)^{-1/2}.\n$$\nThen $\\Delta E_{p}$ is a monotonic function of $\\psi$ alone; equivalently, at fixed $k^{0}$ and $D$, $\\Delta E_{p}$ increases as $\\nu$ increases (because $\\psi \\propto \\nu^{-1/2}$ decreases). Importantly, this dependence arises from interfacial kinetics, not directly from the instantaneous current. While $i_{p}$ for quasi-reversible systems still scales approximately as $\\nu^{1/2}$ under diffusion control (with some deviation from the reversible proportionality constant as kinetics slow), the functional dependence of $\\Delta E_{p}$ on $\\nu$ through $\\psi$ does not yield a linear relation between $\\Delta E_{p}$ and $i_{p}$. Consequently, plotting $\\Delta E_{p}$ versus $i_{p}$ is not linear for kinetic limitation.\n\nDiagnostic conclusion: If $\\Delta E_{p}$ grows linearly with $i_{p}$, the slope giving $2 R_{u}$, the behavior supports high uncompensated resistance. If instead $\\Delta E_{p}$ increases with $\\nu$ but the plot of $\\Delta E_{p}$ versus $i_{p}$ is not linear, the behavior supports slow heterogeneous kinetics. This corresponds to option C in the choices given, since it uses the $\\Delta E_{p}$ versus $i_{p}$ linearity test to unambiguously diagnose ohmic drop versus kinetic limitation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1588814"}]}
