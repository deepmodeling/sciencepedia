The compound is known to undergo a stable and electrochemically reversible one-electron reduction/oxidation process. The student performs a series of Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) experiments, recording five consecutive scans under identical conditions. For a reference electrode, the student uses a simple silver wire, which acts as a quasi-reference electrode. Due to slow reactions with trace impurities in the \"anhydrous\" solvent, the potential of this quasi-reference electrode is known to drift.
