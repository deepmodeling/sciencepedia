A key step in this characterization is to determine the semiconductor's charge carrier type (i.e., whether it is n-type or p-type). To do this, the engineer immerses an electrode made of the new material into an inert electrolyte solution. By applying a range of DC potentials, $E$, to the electrode and measuring the resulting capacitance, $C$, of the semiconductor-electrolyte interface, a Mott-Schottky plot is constructed. This plot graphs the inverse of the capacitance squared, $1/C^2$, as a function of the applied potential, $E$.\n\nAssuming the new material is a typical p-type semiconductor, which of the following statements best describes the expected shape of the Mott-Schottky plot ($1/C^2$ versus $E$) within the potential range where a depletion layer is formed at the interface?\n\nA.

A Mott-Schottky plot shows the relationship between the inverse square of the interfacial capacitance ($1/C^2$) and the applied potential ($E$).\n\nStep 1: Model the semiconductor-electrolyte interface.\nThe interface between a semiconductor electrode and an electrolyte solution can be modeled as a capacitor. The total capacitance is primarily dominated by the capacitance of the space-charge region within the semiconductor, especially in a depletion condition. The space-charge region acts as the dielectric of a capacitor. The capacitance, $C$, for a planar electrode of area $A$ is given by:\n$$C = \\frac{\\epsilon \\epsilon_0 A}{W}$$\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is the relative dielectric constant of the semiconductor, $\\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of vacuum, and $W$ is the width of the space-charge (or depletion) layer.\n\nStep 2: Relate the depletion layer width to the potential.\nThe width of the depletion layer, $W$, is not constant; it depends on the potential drop across it, $\\phi_s$. By solving the one-dimensional Poisson's equation for a semiconductor with a uniform dopant concentration $N$, the depletion width is found to be:\n$$W = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\epsilon \\epsilon_0 |\\phi_s|}{q N}}$$\nwhere $q$ is the elementary charge. For a p-type semiconductor, the dopants are acceptors, so the dopant concentration is the acceptor density, $N_A$.\n\nStep 3: Combine the expressions to find the capacitance-potential relationship.\nSubstitute the expression for $W$ into the equation for $C$:\n$$C = \\frac{\\epsilon \\epsilon_0 A}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\epsilon \\epsilon_0 |\\phi_s|}{q N_A}}} = A \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon \\epsilon_0 q N_A}{2 |\\phi_s|}}$$\nTo obtain the form used in a Mott-Schottky plot, we square both sides and then take the reciprocal:\n$$C^2 = \\frac{A^2 \\epsilon \\epsilon_0 q N_A}{2 |\\phi_s|}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{C^2} = \\frac{2 |\\phi_s|}{A^2 \\epsilon \\epsilon_0 q N_A}$$\nThis is the general form of the Mott-Schottky equation.\n\nStep 4: Specialize to a p-type semiconductor.\nThe potential drop across the space-charge layer, $\\phi_s$, is related to the applied potential $E$ and the flat-band potential $E_{fb}$ (the potential at which the semiconductor bands are flat and there is no space-charge region) by the relation $\\phi_s = E - E_{fb}$.\nFor a p-type semiconductor, the majority charge carriers are holes. A depletion layer is formed when the applied potential is made more negative than the flat-band potential ($E  E_{fb}$). This negative potential repels the majority carriers (holes) from the surface, leaving behind a region depleted of mobile charge but containing a net negative charge from the fixed, ionized acceptor atoms.\nIn this depletion condition for a p-type semiconductor, the potential drop $\\phi_s = E - E_{fb}$ is negative. The Mott-Schottky equation uses the magnitude of this potential drop:\n$$|\\phi_s| = |E - E_{fb}| = E_{fb} - E \\quad (\\text{since } E  E_{fb})$$\n\nStep 5: Finalize the equation and analyze the plot.\nSubstituting this expression for $|\\phi_s|$ into the equation for $1/C^2$:\n$$\\frac{1}{C^2} = \\frac{2 (E_{fb} - E)}{A^2 \\epsilon \\epsilon_0 q N_A}$$\nTo better see the relationship between $1/C^2$ (the y-axis) and $E$ (the x-axis), we can rearrange this equation into the standard linear form $y = mx + b$:\n$$\\frac{1}{C^2} = \\left(\\frac{-2}{A^2 \\epsilon \\epsilon_0 q N_A}\\right) E + \\left(\\frac{2 E_{fb}}{A^2 \\epsilon \\epsilon_0 q N_A}\\right)$$\nIn this equation, the term multiplying the potential $E$ is the slope, $m$:\n$$m = \\frac{-2}{A^2 \\epsilon \\epsilon_0 q N_A}$$\nSince the area $A$, dielectric constant $\\epsilon$, permittivity $\\epsilon_0$, elementary charge $q$, and acceptor concentration $N_A$ are all positive physical constants, the slope $m$ is inherently negative.\nThus, the plot of $1/C^2$ versus $E$ for a p-type semiconductor in the depletion region is a straight line with a negative slope.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. A positive slope is characteristic of an n-type semiconductor, where $|\\phi_s| = E - E_{fb}$ for $E > E_{fb}$. This is incorrect.\nB. A negative slope is characteristic of a p-type semiconductor, as derived above. This is correct.\nC. An exponential relationship is not predicted by the depletion approximation model. This is incorrect.\nD. The relationship is linear, not parabolic. This is incorrect.\nE. From our derivation, $C \\propto (E_{fb} - E)^{-1/2}$, which is not a linear relationship. This is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is a straight line with a negative slope.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1572775"}, {"introduction": "Beyond identifying the semiconductor type, the slope of a Mott-Schottky plot contains valuable quantitative information about the material's dopant density ($N_D$ or $N_A$).
