This first exercise challenges you to apply the foundational principles of doping to select the correct element for creating a p-type silicon semiconductor, a critical component in most modern electronics.[@problem_id:1573585]", "problem": "A materials science team is developing a high-efficiency photovoltaic cell. A critical manufacturing step involves doping an ultrapure monocrystalline silicon (Si) wafer to create a layer with specific electronic properties. Silicon is a Group 14 element and forms a covalent crystal lattice where each atom is bonded to four neighbors. To achieve the desired device performance, this layer must function as a p-type semiconductor, where the majority charge carriers are positive \"holes\".

Sodium (Na)\n\nWhich one of these elements must be introduced into the silicon crystal lattice to create the required p-type semiconductor layer?", "solution": "We require a p-type semiconductor layer in monocrystalline silicon, meaning the majority carriers must be holes. In a covalent crystal where each Si atom forms four bonds, substitutional doping changes the carrier type depending on the dopant valence relative to silicon.\n\nPrinciple of substitutional doping in Si:\n- Silicon has valence $z_{\\text{Si}}=4$ and forms four covalent bonds.\n- If a dopant with valence $z_{D}=3$ (Group 13) substitutes a Si atom, one bond lacks an electron, creating an electron deficiency that behaves as an acceptor. This introduces an acceptor energy level $E_A$ slightly above the valence band edge $E_V$. Thermal excitation promotes an electron from the valence band into the acceptor level, leaving behind a hole in the valence band. The result is p-type conduction, with the Fermi level $E_F$ moving toward $E_V$.\n- If a dopant with valence $z_{D}=5$ (Group 15) substitutes a Si atom, there is one extra electron that occupies a donor level $E_D$ just below the conduction band edge $E_C$. Thermal excitation releases this electron into the conduction band, yielding n-type conduction, with $E_F$ moving toward $E_C$.\n- Isovalent dopants with $z_{D}=4$ do not, in the ideal case, introduce extra carriers; they primarily alloy and modify band structure slightly without creating majority carriers.\n- Dopants that do not substitute well into the Si lattice (e.g., interstitial oxygen) or create deep levels rather than shallow acceptors are unsuitable for controlled shallow p-type doping.\n\nEvaluate each option:\nA. Phosphorus (P): Group 15, $z_{D}=5$, shallow donor with $E_D$ near $E_C$, creating n-type material. Not suitable for p-type.\nB. Germanium (Ge): Group 14, $z_{D}=4$, isovalent with Si; substitution does not create acceptor states and does not generate holes as majority carriers. Not suitable.\nC. Gallium (Ga): Group 13, $z_{D}=3$, shallow acceptor with $E_A$ just above $E_V$; introduces holes and yields p-type material. Suitable.\nD. Oxygen (O): Typically occupies interstitial sites, forms $\\text{Si-O}$ complexes or $\\text{SiO}_2$, and introduces deep levels or compensating defects rather than shallow acceptor states. Not a standard substitutional shallow acceptor in Si. Not suitable.\nE. Sodium (Na): Group 1, $z_{D}=1$, highly mobile ionic contaminant in Si, tends to introduce deep levels and instability; not a shallow acceptor and not used for controlled p-type doping. Not suitable.\n\nTherefore, the dopant that must be introduced to create a p-type layer in silicon is the trivalent acceptor from Group 13: gallium.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1573585"}, {"introduction": "Having explored how single dopants create n-type or p-type materials, we now consider a more complex scenario: what happens when a semiconductor is doped with both donor and acceptor impurities?
