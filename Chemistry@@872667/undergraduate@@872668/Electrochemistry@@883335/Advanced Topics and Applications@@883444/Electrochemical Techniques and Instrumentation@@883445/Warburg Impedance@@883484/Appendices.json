The study is conducted using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), a technique that measures the complex impedance of the system as a function of the frequency of a small-amplitude AC potential. The data is visualized in a Nyquist plot, which shows the negative of the imaginary part of the impedance ($-Z''$) against the real part ($Z'$).\n\nIn an initial experiment conducted in a quiescent (unstirred) solution, the Nyquist plot clearly shows a semicircle in the high-frequency region and a straight line with a slope close to 1 in the low-frequency region. This linear feature is characteristic of Warburg impedance.\n\nThe experiment is then repeated, but this time the solution is subjected to vigorous and uniform stirring. Under these new conditions, the resulting Nyquist plot still displays the high-frequency semicircle, but the straight-line Warburg feature at low frequencies is entirely absent.\n\nGiven this experimental observation, what is the rate-limiting step of the overall electrochemical process under the conditions of vigorous stirring?\n\nA.

The total impedance for semi-infinite diffusion is written symbolically as\n$$\nZ(\\omega) = R_{s} + \\left[\\left(R_{ct} + Z_{W}(\\omega)\\right)^{-1} + j\\omega C_{dl}\\right]^{-1},\n$$\nwhere $R_{s}$ is the solution resistance, $R_{ct}$ is the charge-transfer resistance, $C_{dl}$ is the double-layer capacitance, and $Z_{W}(\\omega)$ is the Warburg diffusion impedance. For semi-infinite diffusion,\n$$\nZ_{W}(\\omega) = \\sigma\\,(1 - j)\\,\\omega^{-1/2},\n$$\nwith $\\sigma$ a constant that depends on the diffusion coefficients, concentrations, and geometry but is kept symbolic here.\n\nTwo standard EIS signatures follow from these expressions:\n1) At high frequency, the parallel branch is dominated by $C_{dl}$, yielding a capacitive arc (semicircle) whose diameter on the real axis equals $R_{ct}$; this is the charge-transfer feature.\n2) At low frequency, $Z_{W}(\\omega)$ grows as $\\omega^{-1/2}$, and the Nyquist locus approaches a line with slope $1$ in $-Z''$ versus $Z'$, the hallmark of semi-infinite diffusion control (Warburg).\n\nIn the quiescent experiment, the observed high-frequency semicircle plus the low-frequency $45^{\\circ}$ line implies that at low frequencies diffusion through a semi-infinite diffusion layer is rate limiting, consistent with the Warburg form above.\n\nUnder vigorous and uniform stirring, convection establishes a finite diffusion layer of thickness $\\delta$ and a large mass transfer coefficient $k_{m} = D/\\delta$ (with $D$ the diffusion coefficient). The associated limiting current density is\n$$\ni_{L} = n F k_{m} C^{*},\n$$\nwhich becomes large as $\\delta$ decreases. In impedance terms, the diffusion element becomes a finite-length diffusion impedance whose low-frequency limit is a finite real resistance rather than a $45^{\\circ}$ line; as $k_{m}$ increases, the magnitude of the mass-transport impedance decreases and can become negligible over the measured frequency range. Consequently, the Nyquist plot loses the Warburg tail and retains only the high-frequency semicircle.\n\nTherefore, with vigorous stirring, mass transport is no longer the rate-limiting step; the dominant (and thus rate-limiting) process is interfacial electron transfer, characterized by $R_{ct} = \\frac{R T}{n F i_{0}}$ (with $i_{0}$ the exchange current density). The persistence of the semicircle and the disappearance of the Warburg feature uniquely indicate kinetic (charge-transfer) control rather than diffusion limitation. Ohmic resistance $R_{s}$ only shifts the plot along the real axis and cannot account for the observed change in low-frequency behavior; thermodynamic favorability is not a kinetic limitation; and a coupled homogeneous reaction would produce a different impedance signature (e.g., Gerischer), which is not observed.\n\nHence, under vigorous stirring, the rate-limiting step is the electron transfer at the electrode-electrolyte interface.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1601010"}, {"introduction": "A hallmark of diffusion control in EIS is the specific way impedance changes with frequency.
