This technique is used to determine the equivalence point of a reaction. Consider two separate precipitation titrations involving silver nitrate ($AgNO_3$) and potassium iodide ($KI$). The reaction in both cases is $Ag^+_{(aq)} + I^-_{(aq)} \\rightarrow AgI_{(s)}$.\n\nA constant potential is applied to a working electrode, carefully chosen such that only silver ions ($Ag^+$) are reducible at the electrode surface, producing a diffusion-limited current proportional to the bulk concentration of $Ag^+$. All other ions in the solution ($K^+$, $I^-$, $NO_3^-$) are not electroactive at this potential.\n\nLet the titration curve be a plot of the measured current (y-axis) versus the volume of titrant added (x-axis). Compare the shapes of the titration curves for the following two scenarios:\n\n**Scenario A:** A solution of $KI$ is titrated with a standard solution of $AgNO_3$.\n**Scenario B:** A solution of $AgNO_3$ is titrated with a standard solution of $KI$.\n\nBased on the principles of amperometry, which of the following options correctly describes the general shapes of the titration curves for Scenario A and Scenario B, respectively? For the purpose of this question, assume that changes in volume due to the addition of titrant have a negligible effect on the concentration, other than through the reaction itself.\n\nA.

The problem statement allows us to neglect volume-change effects on concentration other than through the reaction, so linear dependences of $c_{Ag^{+}}$ on added volume follow directly from mole balances.\n\nScenario A (titrate $KI$ with $AgNO_{3}$): Let the initial moles of iodide be $n_{I,0}$ in an effectively constant volume, and let the titrant concentration be $C_{T}$, so the moles of $Ag^{+}$ added at volume $V$ are $n_{Ag}(V)=C_{T}V$. Up to the equivalence point $V_{e}$ defined by\n$$\nV_{e}=\\frac{n_{I,0}}{C_{T}},\n$$\nall added $Ag^{+}$ is consumed by precipitation, so the free moles of $Ag^{+}$ are\n$$\nn_{Ag}^{\\text{free}}(V)=0 \\quad \\text{for} \\quad V\\leq V_{e}.\n$$\nHence $c_{Ag^{+}}(V)=0$ and $i(V)=0$ (minimal) for $V\\leq V_{e}$.
