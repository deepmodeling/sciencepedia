The sensor consists of an electrode with an immobilized layer of the enzyme Glucose Oxidase (GOx). The sensing mechanism proceeds in three steps within this layer:\n\n1.  `Glucose + GOx(ox) -> Gluconolactone + GOx(red)`\n2.  `GOx(red) + Med(ox) -> GOx(ox) + Med(red)`\n3.  `Med(red) -> Med(ox) + n e-` (at the electrode surface)\n\nHere, `Med(ox)` and `Med(red)` are the oxidized and reduced forms of a mobile redox mediator, respectively. The experiment is conducted in a solution with a saturating concentration of glucose, meaning the first step is very fast and not rate-limiting. A large positive potential is applied to the electrode such that the third step, the electrochemical oxidation of `Med(red)`, is instantaneous upon its arrival at the electrode surface.\n\nThe researcher aims to determine whether the overall rate of the sensor is limited by the kinetics of the catalytic reaction (Step 2) or by the diffusion of the mediator molecules between the enzyme sites and the electrode surface. To do this, a series of sensors are fabricated, each with a different total concentration of the mediator, $C_{Med}$. For each sensor, the pseudo-steady-state current, $I_{ss}$, is measured at a fixed, long time after the potential is applied.\n\nUpon analyzing the data, the researcher observes that a plot of the pseudo-steady-state current $I_{ss}$ versus the square root of the total mediator concentration, $\\sqrt{C_{Med}}$, yields a straight line passing through the origin.\n\nBased on this experimental finding, which of the following is the rate-limiting process for the sensor?\n\nA) The kinetics of the catalytic reaction between the reduced enzyme, `GOx(red)`, and the oxidized mediator, `Med(ox)`.\n\nB) The diffusion of the mediator between the immobilized enzyme and the electrode surface.\n\nC) The initial enzymatic reaction between glucose and the oxidized enzyme, `GOx(ox)`.\n\nD) The heterogeneous electron transfer rate between the reduced mediator, `Med(red)`, and the electrode.\n\nE) The diffusion of glucose from the bulk solution to the immobilized enzyme layer.", "solution": "We begin by identifying which elementary steps can be excluded from being rate-limiting based on the experimental conditions:\n\n- Step 1 (glucose + GOx(ox) → GOx(red)) is stated to be very fast due to saturating glucose; thus it is not rate-limiting.\n- Step 3 (Med(red) → Med(ox) + n e− at the electrode) is made effectively instantaneous by applying a large positive potential; thus it is not rate-limiting.\n- Diffusion of glucose from bulk to the enzyme layer is not rate-limiting under saturating glucose; changing the mediator concentration would not produce a characteristic dependence if glucose diffusion were limiting.\n- Heterogeneous electron transfer of Med(red) at the electrode (Step 3) is not limiting due to the large overpotential (instantaneous conversion upon arrival).\n\nTherefore, the only plausible candidates are:\nA) the homogeneous catalytic kinetics (Step 2), or\nB) diffusion of the mediator between enzyme sites and the electrode.\n\nNext, we compare the expected dependence of the pseudo-steady current on the mediator concentration in each case.\n\n1) If Step 2 (homogeneous catalytic kinetics) is rate-limiting:\nLet $k_{2}$ denote the second-order rate constant for Step 2, $C_{Med,ox}$ the local concentration of oxidized mediator, and $C_{E,red}$ the local concentration of reduced enzyme.

The pseudo-steady current is the Faradaic rate of electron production integrated over the reactive volume,\n$$\nI_{ss} = n F \\int_{\\text{layer}} r_{2}\\,dV \\propto C_{Med}.\n$$\nHence, under kinetic control, $I_{ss}$ is linear in $C_{Med}$:\n$$\nI_{ss} \\propto C_{Med}.\n$$\nConsequently, a plot of $I_{ss}$ versus $\\sqrt{C_{Med}}$ would follow\n$$\nI_{ss} \\propto \\left(\\sqrt{C_{Med}}\\right)^{2},\n$$\nwhich is quadratic in $\\sqrt{C_{Med}}$ and therefore not a straight line through the origin.\n\n2) If mediator diffusion between enzyme sites and the electrode is rate-limiting:\nIn this case, the current is controlled by the diffusive flux of the mobile mediator species cycling between red and ox forms. With Step 3 instantaneous, the electrode acts as a perfect sink for Med(red), and the current equals the steady diffusive flux $J$ of Med(red) to the electrode:\n$$\nI_{ss} = n F A\\,J.\n$$\nIn a pseudo-steady reaction-diffusion situation within a thin immobilized layer, the homogeneous conversion between Med(ox) and Med(red) by the enzyme sets a spatially distributed source/sink, and the resulting diffusive flux obeys a characteristic diffusion-limited scaling with respect to the carrier pool. For mediator-controlled transport in such shuttling systems, the pseudo-steady current exhibits a square-root dependence on the total mediator concentration,\n$$\nI_{ss} \\propto \\sqrt{C_{Med}},\n$$\nwhich is the diagnostic signature of diffusion control in a redox-shuttle film: increasing the total pool of mobile mediator increases the diffusive conductance, but with a sublinear, square-root scaling that arises from the reaction-diffusion balance within the film.\n\nTherefore, the experimental observation that a plot of $I_{ss}$ versus $\\sqrt{C_{Med}}$ is a straight line through the origin directly matches the diffusion-limited prediction and contradicts the kinetics-limited prediction.\n\nExcluding the other options:\n- C) is excluded by saturating glucose (Step 1 not rate-limiting).\n- D) is excluded by the large overpotential rendering Step 3 instantaneous.\n- E) is excluded by saturating glucose and the mediator-dependence observed.\n\nThus, the rate-limiting process is the diffusion of the mediator between the immobilized enzyme and the electrode surface.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1537467"}]}
