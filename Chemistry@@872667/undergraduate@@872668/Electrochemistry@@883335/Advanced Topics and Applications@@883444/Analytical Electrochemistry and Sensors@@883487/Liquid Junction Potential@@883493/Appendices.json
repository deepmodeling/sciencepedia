A liquid junction potential, $E_j$, develops across this boundary. For the purpose of this problem, you are given the experimental fact that the ionic mobility of a hydrogen ion ($H^+$) is significantly greater than the ionic mobility of a sodium ion ($\\text{Na}^+$). The ionic mobility of the chloride ion ($\\text{Cl}^-$) is intermediate between the two.\n\nThe liquid junction potential is defined as $E_j = \\phi_{\\text{NaCl}} - \\phi_{\\text{HCl}}$, where $\\phi_{\\text{NaCl}}$ is the electric potential on the NaCl side of the junction and $\\phi_{\\text{HCl}}$ is the electric potential on the HCl side.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the sign of the liquid junction potential and the primary reason for it?\n\nA. The potential is negative because $\\text{Na}^+$ ions are heavier than $H^+$ ions, causing them to diffuse more slowly.\n\nB.

The potential is zero because the concentrations of both electrolytes are identical, and the charge of the common anion ($\\text{Cl}^-$) is the same.", "solution": "Let the HCl solution occupy the left side and the NaCl solution the right side of a one-dimensional junction along coordinate $x$, with $x$ increasing from left (HCl) to right (NaCl). Let the common molar concentration on each side be $c$. Thus, on the HCl side, $c_{H^{+}}=c$ and $c_{Cl^{-}}=c$ while $c_{Na^{+}}=0$, and on the NaCl side, $c_{Na^{+}}=c$ and $c_{Cl^{-}}=c$ while $c_{H^{+}}=0$. The given mobilities satisfy\n$$\nu_{H^{+}} \\gg u_{Na^{+}}, \\quad \\text{with } u_{Cl^{-}} \\text{ intermediate}.\n$$\n\nThe Nernst–Planck expression for the flux $J_{i}$ of ion $i$ (valence $z_{i}$, concentration $c_{i}$, diffusion coefficient $D_{i}$, mobility $u_{i}$) along $x$ is\n$$\nJ_{i}=-D_{i}\\frac{dc_{i}}{dx}-z_{i}u_{i}F\\,c_{i}\\frac{d\\phi}{dx},\n$$\nwith $D_{i}=\\frac{RT}{F}u_{i}$ by the Nernst–Einstein relation. In steady state across a liquid junction with no external circuit, the condition of zero net current is\n$$\n0= \\sum_{i} z_{i}F J_{i}.\n$$\n\nNear the junction, the concentration profiles change from their left values to their right values. With $x$ increasing left to right:\n- $c_{H^{+}}$ decreases from $c$ to $0$, so $\\frac{dc_{H^{+}}}{dx}<0$ and the diffusive term $-D_{H^{+}}\\frac{dc_{H^{+}}}{dx}>0$, giving a rightward diffusive flux of $H^{+}$.\n- $c_{Na^{+}}$ increases from $0$ to $c$, so $\\frac{dc_{Na^{+}}}{dx}>0$ and the diffusive term $-D_{Na^{+}}\\frac{dc_{Na^{+}}}{dx}<0$, giving a leftward diffusive flux of $Na^{+}$.\n- Initially, $c_{Cl^{-}}$ is equal on both sides, so its pure diffusive drive is weaker than that of the cations; it adjusts primarily to maintain local electroneutrality under the developing electric field.\n\nBecause $u_{H^{+}} \\gg u_{Na^{+}}$, and $D_{i}\\propto u_{i}$, the rightward diffusive flux of $H^{+}$ is much larger in magnitude than the leftward diffusive flux of $Na^{+}$ that would occur in the absence of an electric field. Hence, without an electric field, the net charge flux would be positive to the right. To enforce the zero-current condition, an electric field must arise that opposes the motion of the faster cation ($H^{+}$ to the right) and assists the motion of the slower cation ($Na^{+}$ to the left). This requires an electric field directed from right to left, i.e.,\n$$\nE=-\\frac{d\\phi}{dx}<0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{d\\phi}{dx}>0.\n$$\n\nIntegrating across the junction from left (HCl) to right (NaCl),\n$$\nE_{j}=\\phi_{\\text{NaCl}}-\\phi_{\\text{HCl}}=\\int_{\\text{HCl}}^{\\text{NaCl}} d\\phi > 0.\n$$\nEquivalently, one can state that $H^{+}$ leaves the HCl side more rapidly than $Na^{+}$ leaves the NaCl side; the NaCl side accumulates positive charge while the HCl side becomes negative, so the potential on the NaCl side is higher.\n\nThis sign and rationale correspond to the statement that the potential is positive because the higher mobility of $H^{+}$ compared to $Na^{+}$ leads to a net flow of positive charge into the NaCl solution. Option A incorrectly attributes the effect to ionic mass rather than mobility. Option C incorrectly assigns control solely to the common anion. Option D asserts the wrong sign despite describing the correct mobility trend. Option E is incorrect because equal concentrations do not guarantee zero junction potential when ionic mobilities differ.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1989553"}, {"introduction": "Moving from qualitative prediction to quantitative analysis, this problem challenges you to calculate the magnitude of a liquid junction potential using experimental data.
