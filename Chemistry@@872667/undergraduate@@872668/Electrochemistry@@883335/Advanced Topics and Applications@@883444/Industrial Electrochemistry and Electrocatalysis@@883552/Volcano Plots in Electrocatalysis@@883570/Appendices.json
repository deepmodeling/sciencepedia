[@problem_id:1600498]", "problem": "In the pursuit of a sustainable hydrogen economy, researchers are constantly searching for new, efficient electrocatalysts for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER), the process by which protons (H⁺) are reduced to hydrogen gas (H₂). The performance of a catalyst is often evaluated by its exchange current density, denoted as $j_0$, which is a measure of the intrinsic rate of the reaction at the equilibrium potential. A higher value of $j_0$ signifies a more active catalyst.\n\nThe catalytic activity is governed by a fundamental trade-off described by the Sabatier principle. This principle relates the catalyst's activity to its interaction strength with a key reaction intermediate, in this case, an adsorbed hydrogen atom ($H^*$). The strength of this interaction is quantified by the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption, $\\Delta G_{H^*}$.\n\nA materials science team is computationally screening a wide range of novel metal alloys for their potential as HER catalysts. Their simulations provide $\\Delta G_{H^*}$ values that span from highly negative (indicating very strong binding of hydrogen to the catalyst surface) to positive (indicating very weak binding). The goal is to predict which of these materials will exhibit the highest activity.\n\nAssuming the logarithm of the exchange current density, $\\log(j_0)$, is plotted on the y-axis and the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption, $\\Delta G_{H^*}$, is plotted on the x-axis, which of the following statements best describes the expected trend?\n\nA.

The HER typically proceeds via the Volmer step (adsorption) and either the Heyrovsky or Tafel step (desorption/recombination). The free energy of the key intermediate $H^{*}$, quantified by $\\Delta G_{H^{*}}$, controls which step is rate-limiting:\n- If $\\Delta G_{H^{*}} \\ll 0$ (very strong binding), the surface is covered with $H^{*}$ and the desorption/recombination step is slow (large barrier), lowering $j_{0}$.\n- If $\\Delta G_{H^{*}} \\gg 0$ (very weak binding), forming $H^{*}$ is difficult and the adsorption step is slow (large barrier), lowering $j_{0}$.\n- Therefore, an intermediate $\\Delta G_{H^{*}}$ balances adsorption and desorption barriers, maximizing $j_{0}$.\n\nBEP scaling and a volcano relation. Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi relations express activation barriers as affine functions of the reaction free energies. Denote the Volmer (adsorption) barrier by $\\Delta G_{V}^{\\ddagger}$ and the desorption-limiting barrier (Heyrovsky or Tafel) by $\\Delta G_{D}^{\\ddagger}$.
