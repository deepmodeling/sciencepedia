The performance of the catalyst is quantified by its kinetic current density, $j_k$, measured at a potential of $0.90 \\text{ V}$ vs. a Reversible Hydrogen Electrode (RHE). The experiment aims to distinguish between two primary degradation pathways: irreversible loss of Electrochemical Surface Area (ECSA) due to particle agglomeration, and reversible deactivation due to poisoning by a sulfur-containing species present in the reactant stream.\n\nThe experiment proceeds in three stages:\n1.  **Initial State**: The fresh catalyst exhibits an initial kinetic current density of $j_{k,0} = 15.0 \\text{ mA cm}^{-2}$.\n2.  **Degradation State**: The catalyst undergoes an Accelerated Stress Test (AST).

The kinetic current density, $j_k$, is proportional to the active (unpoisoned) surface area: $j_k = i_s \\times ECSA_{active}$.\n\n**Initial State:**\nInitially, the catalyst is fresh and unpoisoned, so the active area is the total area, $ECSA_0$. The initial current density is:\n$$j_{k,0} = i_s \\times ECSA_0$$\nWe are given $j_{k,0} = 15.0 \\text{ mA cm}^{-2}$.\n\n**Post-Recovery State:**\nIt is most straightforward to first analyze the state after the recovery protocol. Let $ECSA_1$ be the total ECSA after the irreversible degradation caused by the Accelerated Stress Test (AST). The recovery protocol removes all poison but does not alter the ECSA further. Therefore, after recovery, the active surface area is simply $ECSA_1$. The current density in this state is:\n$$j_{k,2} = i_s \\times ECSA_1$$\nWe are given $j_{k,2} = 9.00 \\text{ mA cm}^{-2}$.\n\n**Calculation of Irreversible ECSA Loss ($L_{irrev}$):**\nThe first part of the problem asks for the fraction of ECSA lost irreversibly. This can be found by comparing the ECSA before the test ($ECSA_0$) and after the test ($ECSA_1$). We can form a ratio of the current densities from the initial and post-recovery states:\n$$\\frac{j_{k,2}}{j_{k,0}} = \\frac{i_s \\times ECSA_1}{i_s \\times ECSA_0} = \\frac{ECSA_1}{ECSA_0}$$\nThis ratio, $\\frac{ECSA_1}{ECSA_0}$, represents the fraction of ECSA remaining after the AST. The fraction of ECSA lost, $L_{irrev}$, is therefore:\n$$L_{irrev} = 1 - \\frac{ECSA_1}{ECSA_0} = 1 - \\frac{j_{k,2}}{j_{k,0}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$L_{irrev} = 1 - \\frac{9.00 \\text{ mA cm}^{-2}}{15.0 \\text{ mA cm}^{-2}} = 1 - 0.600 = 0.400$$\nSo, 40.0% of the initial ECSA was lost irreversibly.\n\n**Degradation State (Pre-Recovery):**\nNow we analyze the state at the end of the AST, but before recovery. The total ECSA is $ECSA_1$. However, a fraction of these sites, which we denote as the poison coverage $\\theta_p$, are blocked by the sulfur species. The active surface area is thus $ECSA_{active,1} = ECSA_1 \\times (1 - \\theta_p)$.

This fraction, $F_{poison}$, is the ratio of the poisoned area at the end of the test to the initial area.\n$$F_{poison} = \\frac{\\text{Poisoned Area}}{\\text{Initial Area}} = \\frac{ECSA_1 \\times \\theta_p}{ECSA_0}$$\nWe can rewrite this expression as:\n$$F_{poison} = \\left(\\frac{ECSA_1}{ECSA_0}\\right) \\times \\theta_p$$\nWe have already determined both terms in this product:\n$$\\frac{ECSA_1}{ECSA_0} = \\frac{j_{k,2}}{j_{k,0}} = 0.600$$\n$$\\theta_p = 1 - \\frac{j_{k,1}}{j_{k,2}} = 0.500$$\nNow, we calculate $F_{poison}$:\n$$F_{poison} = 0.600 \\times 0.500 = 0.300$$\nThis means that 30.0% of the initial active sites were rendered inactive by the reversible poison at the end of the AST.\n\nThe final answer is the row matrix $[L_{irrev}, F_{poison}]$, with each value rounded to three significant figures.\n$L_{irrev} = 0.400$\n$F_{poison} = 0.300$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.400 & 0.300 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1552964"}]}
