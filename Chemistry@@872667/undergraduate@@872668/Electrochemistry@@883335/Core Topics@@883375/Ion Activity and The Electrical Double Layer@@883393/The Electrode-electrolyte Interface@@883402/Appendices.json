The interface between the electrode and the electrolyte exhibits a constant specific double-layer capacitance, $C_{dl}$.\n\nInitially, the electrode is held at a potential where no significant faradaic reaction occurs. At time $t=0$, the potential is instantaneously stepped to a new value. This potential step, of magnitude $|\\Delta E|$, is large enough to cause the reduction of species `O` to `R` to become immediately diffusion-limited.
