The concentration of the complex anion, $c_{[CdI_4]^{2-}}$, is negligible. The equation simplifies to $J_{Cd, net} \\approx E \\cdot c_{Cd^{2+}} u_{Cd^{2+}}$, which is a positive value. Thus, the net transport is towards the cathode, and $t_{Cd}$ is positive.\n- **As concentration increases:** According to Le Chatelier's principle, increasing the overall concentration of $CdI_2$ increases the concentration of $I^-$, shifting the equilibrium to the right. This causes the concentration of the complex anion, $c_{[CdI_4]^{2-}}$, to increase significantly, while the concentration of free $c_{Cd^{2+}}$ decreases.\n- **At high concentrations:** It is possible for the term representing transport towards the anode, $c_{[CdI_4]^{2-}} u_{[CdI_4]^{2-}}$, to become larger than the term for transport towards the cathode, $c_{Cd^{2+}} u_{Cd^{2+}}$. When this happens, $J_{Cd, net}$ becomes negative. This means the net transport of cadmium is now directed towards the anode.
