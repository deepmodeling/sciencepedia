This exercise is crucial for mastering the basic calculation and the essential skill of ensuring consistent units.", "problem": "A biomedical engineering team is developing a prototype for a transdermal patch designed for the controlled release of lithium ions ($Li^{+}$). The patch consists of a polymer hydrogel layer with a uniform thickness $L$. This hydrogel is saturated with a lithium chloride ($\\text{LiCl}$) solution, resulting in an initial, uniform concentration of $Li^{+}$ ions, $C_1$. To test the passive diffusion rate, the patch is placed in contact with a large, well-stirred volume of a saline solution that initially contains no lithium ions, so the concentration of $Li^{+}$ at the interface with the saline solution can be considered to be $C_2 = 0$. Assume that under these conditions, a linear concentration gradient is quickly established across the thickness of the hydrogel, and that this gradient remains constant for the initial phase of the diffusion process (steady-state).\n\nGiven the following parameters:\n- Hydrogel thickness, $L = 0.750\\,\\text{mm}$\n- Initial $Li^{+}$ concentration in the hydrogel, $C_1 = 0.600\\,\\text{M}$\n- Diffusion coefficient of $Li^{+}$ ions within the hydrogel at the operating temperature, $D = 8.95 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\text{m}^2/\\text{s}$\n\nCalculate the magnitude of the initial steady-state molar flux of $Li^{+}$ ions out of the patch.

This can be described by Fick's first law of diffusion.\n\nFick's first law states that the molar flux $J$ is proportional to the concentration gradient $\\frac{dC}{dx}$:\n$$J = -D \\frac{dC}{dx}$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. The negative sign indicates that diffusion occurs from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration.\n\nThe problem states that we can assume a linear concentration gradient across the hydrogel layer of thickness $L$. Therefore, the concentration gradient can be approximated as:\n$$\\frac{dC}{dx} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{C_2 - C_1}{L}$$\nwhere $C_1$ is the concentration at the start of the diffusion path (inside the patch) and $C_2$ is the concentration at the end of the path (in the saline solution).\n\nSubstituting this into Fick's first law, we get:\n$$J = -D \\frac{C_2 - C_1}{L}$$\nSince we are asked for the magnitude of the flux, we can write:\n$$|J| = \\left| -D \\frac{C_2 - C_1}{L} \\right| = D \\frac{C_1 - C_2}{L}$$\nas $C_1  C_2$.
