The species undergoes a reversible one-electron reduction followed by an irreversible first-order chemical reaction. This process is known as a reversible electrochemical-chemical (ErC) mechanism, represented by the following scheme:\n\nStep 1 (Electrochemical): $O + e^{-} \\rightleftharpoons R$\nStep 2 (Chemical): $R \\xrightarrow{k_c} P$\n\nThe experiment starts with a solution containing only species $O$. The potential is scanned from a value where no reaction occurs to a potential sufficiently negative to cause the reduction of $O$ to $R$, generating a cathodic peak current, $i_{pc}$. The scan direction is then reversed, causing any unreacted species $R$ near the electrode to be oxidized back to $O$, which generates an anodic peak current, $i_{pa}$.\n\nThe experiment is conducted at a constant potential scan rate, $\\nu$. It is known that the chemical step (Step 2) has a thermal activation energy, $E_{a,c}$, which is significantly greater than the activation energy for the diffusion of the species in the solution, $E_{a,D}$.\n\nIf the electrochemist increases the temperature of the electrochemical cell while keeping all other conditions (concentrations, scan rate, etc.) constant, how will the ratio of the magnitudes of the peak currents, $|i_{pa}/i_{pc}|$, change?\n\nA.

The ratio $|i_{pa}/i_{pc}|$ will remain constant at its initial value, which is less than 1.\n\nE. The change in the ratio cannot be determined without knowing the exact value of the scan rate.", "solution": "The problem describes an electrochemical experiment involving an ErC mechanism ($O + e^{-} \\rightleftharpoons R$, followed by $R \\xrightarrow{k_c} P$) and asks for the effect of temperature on the cyclic voltammogram's peak current ratio, $|i_{pa}/i_{pc}|$.\n\nStep 1: Understand the basis of the peak current ratio in an ErC mechanism.\nIn the forward (cathodic) scan, species $O$ is reduced to $R$, giving rise to the cathodic peak current, $i_{pc}$. The magnitude of this peak is primarily determined by the transport of $O$ to the electrode surface. Once formed, the species $R$ can undergo two competing processes: it can diffuse away from the electrode and be re-oxidized back to $O$ on the reverse (anodic) scan, or it can be consumed by the follow-up chemical reaction to form species $P$.\nThe reverse anodic peak current, $i_{pa}$, is due to the oxidation of the fraction of $R$ that has not reacted chemically and is still near the electrode surface. Because the chemical step consumes some of the species $R$, there is less $R$ available for re-oxidation compared to a simple, reversible E mechanism (where no chemical step occurs). Consequently, for an ErC mechanism, the magnitude of the reverse peak is smaller than the forward peak, meaning $|i_{pa}/i_{pc}| < 1$. The only case where the ratio is 1 is when the chemical reaction is infinitely slow ($k_c = 0$).\n\nStep 2: Identify the competing processes that determine the peak current ratio.\nThe value of the ratio $|i_{pa}/i_{pc}|$ is a measure of the reversibility of the overall process. It is determined by the competition between the rate of the chemical reaction and the rate of the mass transport (diffusion) within the timescale of the CV experiment. The timescale of the experiment is held constant since the scan rate $\\nu$ is constant. The competition is therefore between the rate of the chemical reaction, governed by the rate constant $k_c$, and the rate of diffusion, governed by the diffusion coefficient $D$.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the temperature dependence of the competing rates.\nBoth the chemical reaction and diffusion are thermally activated processes. Their rates can be described by Arrhenius-type relationships:\nThe rate constant of the chemical reaction is given by:\n$$k_c(T) = A_c \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{a,c}}{RT}\\right)$$\nwhere $A_c$ is the pre-exponential factor for the reaction, $E_{a,c}$ is its activation energy, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nSimilarly, the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient can be described as:\n$$D(T) = D_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{a,D}}{RT}\\right)$$\nwhere $D_0$ is a pre-exponential factor and $E_{a,D}$ is the activation energy for diffusion.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the relative change in rates with temperature.\nThe problem states that the activation energy of the chemical step is significantly greater than that for diffusion: $E_{a,c} > E_{a,D}$. We want to understand how the relative importance of these two processes changes as temperature increases. Let's consider the ratio of the two rate-determining parameters, $k_c$ and $D$.\n$$\\frac{k_c(T)}{D(T)} = \\frac{A_c \\exp(-E_{a,c}/(RT))}{D_0 \\exp(-E_{a,D}/(RT))} = \\frac{A_c}{D_0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{a,c} - E_{a,D}}{RT}\\right)$$\nLet $\\Delta E_a = E_{a,c} - E_{a,D}$. The problem states that $\\Delta E_a > 0$.\nNow, let's examine what happens when the temperature $T$ increases. As $T$ increases, the term $1/T$ decreases. Since $\\Delta E_a$ is positive, the exponent $(-\\Delta E_a/(RT))$ is a negative term whose magnitude decreases as $T$ increases (i.e., it becomes less negative, or increases). Because the exponential function is monotonically increasing, an increase in its argument leads to an increase in its value.\nTherefore, as temperature increases, the ratio $k_c/D$ increases. This means that the rate of the chemical reaction increases more steeply with temperature than the rate of diffusion.\n\nStep 5: Conclude the effect on the peak current ratio.\nAn increase in the relative rate of the chemical reaction ($k_c$) compared to the rate of mass transport ($D$) means that the chemical step becomes more dominant at higher temperatures. During the fixed timescale of the CV scan, a larger fraction of the electrochemically generated species $R$ will be consumed by the chemical reaction to form $P$.\nThis leaves a smaller amount of $R$ available near the electrode surface to be re-oxidized during the reverse anodic scan. As a result, the magnitude of the anodic peak current, $|i_{pa}|$, will decrease relative to the magnitude of the cathodic peak current, $|i_{pc}|$.\nTherefore, as the temperature is increased, the ratio $|i_{pa}/i_{pc}|$ will decrease, moving further away from 1 and closer to 0, indicating that the overall process appears more irreversible.\nThis corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1573260"}]}
