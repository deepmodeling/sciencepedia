In the experiment, a series of steady-state currents, denoted as `I_i`, are measured at corresponding applied potentials, `E_i`. The goal of this analysis is to create a Tafel plot in order to extract fundamental kinetic parameters. The equilibrium potential for the O/R redox couple under the given experimental conditions is known to be `E_eq`, and the active surface area of the working electrode is `A`.\n\nA Tafel plot is a graphical representation used in electrode kinetics, where the x-axis is the overpotential, `η`, and the y-axis is the base-10 logarithm of the absolute value of the current density, `\\log |j|`. The raw measured data from the experiment consists of pairs `(E_i, I_i)`.\n\nWhich of the following operations describes the necessary transformation of the raw experimental data to obtain the physically meaningful quantity that serves as the independent variable (the x-axis) for the Tafel plot?\n\nA.

A Tafel plot is a graph of `\\log |j|` versus `η`.\n\nThe independent variable, plotted on the x-axis, is the overpotential, `η`. The overpotential is the difference between the potential applied to an electrode, `E`, and the thermodynamic equilibrium potential, `E_eq`, for the redox reaction being studied.\n$$\n\\eta = E - E_{eq}\n$$\nThe overpotential represents the \"excess\" potential or electrochemical driving force that pushes the reaction away from equilibrium, causing a net flow of current. The raw data provides the applied potential `E_i` for each measurement point. Therefore, to obtain the independent variable `η_i` for the Tafel plot, one must subtract the known equilibrium potential `E_eq` from each measured applied potential `E_i`.\n\nThe dependent variable, which is related to the y-axis of the Tafel plot, is the current density, `j`. The current density is the measured current, `I`, normalized by the electrode's surface area, `A`.\n$$\nj = \\frac{I}{A}\n$$\nNormalizing the current to current density allows for the comparison of kinetic data across experiments using electrodes of different sizes. The y-axis of the Tafel plot is specifically the base-10 logarithm of the absolute value of the current density, `\\log |j|`.\n\nNow, we can evaluate the given options based on these definitions:\n\nA. Convert each measured current `I_i` to its logarithmic value, `\\log |I_i|`. This step pertains to the dependent variable (y-axis), not the independent variable (x-axis). Furthermore, it is an incomplete transformation for the y-axis, as it omits the crucial normalization by the electrode area `A` to get the current density `j_i`.\n\nB. Calculate the overpotential `η_i = E_i - E_eq` for each applied potential `E_i`. This is the exact definition of the overpotential, `η`, which is the independent variable (x-axis) in a Tafel plot. This transformation converts the raw measured potential `E_i` into the physically meaningful driving force `η_i` required for the analysis. This is a correct and necessary step.\n\nC. Normalize each measured current `I_i` by the electrode area `A` to obtain the current density `j_i = I_i / A`. This operation is a necessary step to calculate the quantity for the dependent variable (y-axis). However, the question specifically asks for the transformation to obtain the independent variable (x-axis).\n\nD. Calculate the total charge `Q_i` passed for each data point by integrating the current over the measurement time. This calculation relates to Faradaic efficiency and coulometry, which are different types of electrochemical analysis. It is not a step in constructing a Tafel plot from steady-state current-potential data.\n\nE. Fit the raw `(E_i, I_i)` data to a linear model to find the cell's internal resistance. The relationship between current and overpotential in the Tafel region is exponential (linear on a semi-log plot), not linear. While correcting for ohmic drop (related to cell resistance) is an important consideration in many electrochemical experiments, it is a correction applied to the potential, not the primary definition of the independent variable itself, and fitting a simple linear model to `(E_i, I_i)` data is generally incorrect for describing electrode kinetics.\n\nTherefore, the most fundamental transformation required to obtain the independent variable for the Tafel plot is the calculation of the overpotential from the applied potential and the equilibrium potential.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1599157"}, {"introduction": "The Tafel equation provides a powerful link between the rate of an electrochemical reaction (current density) and the activation overpotential.
