## Introduction
In the world of electrochemistry, no process is perfectly efficient. When an [electric current](@entry_id:261145) flows, a cell's voltage inevitably deviates from its ideal, thermodynamic potential—a phenomenon known as [overpotential](@entry_id:139429). This energy 'toll' is critical to understanding and engineering electrochemical devices. While various factors contribute to this loss, one of the most fundamental and pervasive is the resistance overpotential, commonly called the ohmic or iR drop. This article tackles the challenge of isolating and understanding this key source of inefficiency, which arises from the inherent resistance electricity encounters as it flows through a cell. Across the following sections, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of this concept. "Principles and Mechanisms" will dissect the physical origins of iR drop, its mathematical basis in Ohm's law, and the essential techniques used to measure and compensate for it. "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" will then demonstrate its profound impact on the performance of batteries, the rate of corrosion, and even the study of [neurobiology](@entry_id:269208). Finally, "Hands-On Practices" will allow you to apply these concepts through guided problems, cementing your ability to analyze and engineer real-world electrochemical systems.

## Principles and Mechanisms

In the study of electrochemistry, the deviation of an electrode's potential from its equilibrium value when a current is flowing is known as **overpotential**. This phenomenon is a direct manifestation of the energetic costs associated with driving an electrochemical reaction at a finite rate. While the preceding chapter introduced the concept of [overpotential](@entry_id:139429), here we delve into one of its most fundamental and ubiquitous components: the **resistance [overpotential](@entry_id:139429)**, often referred to as the **[ohmic drop](@entry_id:272464)** or **iR drop**. Unlike other forms of [overpotential](@entry_id:139429) that are tied to the kinetics of [charge transfer](@entry_id:150374) or mass transport, the [ohmic drop](@entry_id:272464) is a purely resistive phenomenon, governed by the principles of [electrical conduction](@entry_id:190687) through the various components of an electrochemical cell.

### The Nature and Impact of Ohmic Overpotential

When an [electric current](@entry_id:261145), $I$, flows through an electrochemical cell, it must traverse materials that possess finite [electrical resistance](@entry_id:138948). These include the electrodes, the external contacts, and, most significantly, the electrolyte solution or ion-conducting membrane separating the electrodes. According to Ohm's law, forcing a current through a resistor results in a potential drop. This potential drop within the cell is the [ohmic overpotential](@entry_id:262967), $\eta_R$.

Mathematically, it is expressed as:

$$ \eta_R = I R_{\text{internal}} $$

where $R_{\text{internal}}$ is the total [internal resistance](@entry_id:268117) of the cell. This potential represents a direct loss of energy. For a galvanic cell (like a battery or fuel cell), the iR drop subtracts from the useful voltage the cell can deliver. For an [electrolytic cell](@entry_id:145661) (like an electrolyzer or a charging battery), it represents an additional voltage that must be applied to drive the reaction, thus increasing the energy consumption.

The total overpotential, $\eta_{\text{total}}$, which is the difference between the actual cell potential under current, $E_{\text{cell}}$, and the [thermodynamic equilibrium](@entry_id:141660) potential, $E_{\text{eq}}$, is a sum of contributions:

$$ \eta_{\text{total}} = E_{\text{cell}} - E_{\text{eq}} = \eta_a + \eta_c + \eta_R $$

Here, $\eta_a$ is the **[activation overpotential](@entry_id:264155)** associated with the energy barrier of the [electron transfer](@entry_id:155709) reaction, and $\eta_c$ is the **[concentration overpotential](@entry_id:276562)** arising from gradients in reactant and product concentrations near the electrode surface. The [ohmic overpotential](@entry_id:262967), $\eta_R$, is a distinct contributor to this total energy loss. For instance, in a zinc-bromine flow battery being charged, a significant portion of the extra voltage required beyond the equilibrium potential can be consumed simply in overcoming the [internal resistance](@entry_id:268117). In a hypothetical cell where charging at $25.0 \text{ A}$ requires $2.15 \text{ V}$ against an [equilibrium potential](@entry_id:166921) of $1.83 \text{ V}$, if the [internal resistance](@entry_id:268117) is $0.00960 \text{ } \Omega$, the [ohmic drop](@entry_id:272464) is $\eta_R = (25.0 \text{ A})(0.00960 \text{ } \Omega) = 0.240 \text{ V}$. This accounts for $75\%$ of the total [overpotential](@entry_id:139429) of $0.32 \text{ V}$ [@problem_id:1566880].

It is crucial to distinguish the nature of these losses. Activation and concentration overpotentials are related to the **kinetics** of the electrode processes. In contrast, the [ohmic overpotential](@entry_id:262967) is a purely **dissipative** loss. The energy corresponding to the iR drop, calculated as power $P_R = I \eta_R = I^2 R_{\text{internal}}$, is converted directly into heat (Joule heating), raising the temperature of the cell but not contributing to the rate of the chemical transformation itself. This contrasts with the power loss associated with non-resistive overpotentials ($P_{\text{nr}} = I \eta_{\text{nr}}$), which represents the energy needed to surmount the kinetic barriers of the reaction [@problem_id:1584739].

### Physical Origins of Ohmic Resistance

The [internal resistance](@entry_id:268117) of a cell is a composite property. While electrodes and electrical contacts contribute, the dominant source of resistance is typically the medium that conducts ions between the [anode and cathode](@entry_id:262146): the **[electrolyte solution](@entry_id:263636)** or a solid/polymeric **ion-conducting membrane**.

The ability of an electrolyte to conduct electricity is quantified by its **conductivity**, $\kappa$ (units of S/m). Conductivity is the reciprocal of resistivity, $\rho$. For a uniform conductor of length $d$ and cross-sectional area $A$, the resistance $R$ is given by $R = \rho d / A = d / (\kappa A)$.

In many [electrochemical cells](@entry_id:200358), such as industrial electrolyzers, the electrodes can be approximated as parallel plates. The [current density](@entry_id:190690), $j$, is the current per unit area, $j=I/A$. The [ohmic overpotential](@entry_id:262967) across the electrolyte can then be expressed in terms of these fundamental properties:

$$ \eta_R = I R_{\text{sol}} = (jA) \left( \frac{d}{\kappa A} \right) = \frac{jd}{\kappa} $$

This simple but powerful relationship reveals the key factors that govern the magnitude of the [ohmic drop](@entry_id:272464). As illustrated in the design of an industrial [water-splitting](@entry_id:176561) reactor, the iR drop is directly proportional to the [current density](@entry_id:190690) ($j$) and the distance between the electrodes ($d$), and inversely proportional to the electrolyte conductivity ($\kappa$) [@problem_id:1584748] [@problem_id:1562886]. This explains a critical observation in [applied electrochemistry](@entry_id:171628): **ohmic losses become increasingly significant at high current densities**, often becoming the dominant source of inefficiency in high-power devices.

The conductivity $\kappa$ itself depends on the microscopic properties of the electrolyte. According to **Kohlrausch's law of [independent migration of ions](@entry_id:270671)**, the [molar conductivity](@entry_id:272691) of a strong electrolyte at infinite dilution, $\Lambda_m^\circ$, is the sum of the contributions from its individual ions:

$$ \Lambda_m^\circ = \nu_+ \lambda_+^\circ + \nu_- \lambda_-^\circ $$

where $\nu_+$ and $\nu_-$ are the stoichiometric numbers of the cations and [anions](@entry_id:166728) in the electrolyte formula, and $\lambda^\circ$ are their respective **limiting molar ionic conductivities**. The overall solution conductivity is then $\kappa = c \Lambda_m$, where $c$ is the molar concentration. This framework allows us to predict how the choice of electrolyte affects resistance. For example, comparing $0.150 \text{ M}$ solutions of NaCl and MgCl$_2$, we note that MgCl$_2$ dissociates into three ions (one Mg$^{2+}$ and two Cl$^-$) while NaCl provides only two (one Na$^+$ and one Cl$^-$). Furthermore, the divalent Mg$^{2+}$ ion carries more charge. Both factors lead to a significantly higher [molar conductivity](@entry_id:272691) for MgCl$_2$. Consequently, for the same current and cell geometry, the MgCl$_2$ solution will exhibit a much lower iR drop than the NaCl solution, demonstrating the profound impact of ion choice on cell performance [@problem_id:1584761].

### Measurement and Compensation of iR Drop

Given its detrimental impact on both [energy efficiency](@entry_id:272127) and the accuracy of electrochemical measurements, quantifying and minimizing iR drop is a primary concern for electrochemists. Several techniques have been developed for this purpose.

#### High-Speed Timing Methods

The key to separating [ohmic overpotential](@entry_id:262967) from other contributions lies in their different response times. When a current is suddenly applied to a cell (a **galvanostatic step**), the potential response is not monolithic. The [ohmic drop](@entry_id:272464), $\eta_R = IR$, appears instantaneously. This is because the electric field that drives [ionic current](@entry_id:175879) propagates through the solution at nearly the speed of light. In contrast, the [activation overpotential](@entry_id:264155), $\eta_a$, builds up over a timescale of microseconds to milliseconds as it involves charging the capacitance of the **[electrical double layer](@entry_id:160711)** at the [electrode-electrolyte interface](@entry_id:267344). The [concentration overpotential](@entry_id:276562), $\eta_c$, evolves even more slowly, on the order of seconds, as it requires the physical movement of ions over macroscopic distances via diffusion to establish concentration gradients [@problem_id:1584757].

This temporal separation is exploited by the **[current interrupt technique](@entry_id:266101)**. In this method, a cell is operated at a steady current $I$. The total measured potential is $V_{on} = E_{\text{potential}} + IR_{\text{internal}}$, where $E_{\text{potential}}$ includes the [equilibrium potential](@entry_id:166921) and the kinetic overpotentials ($\eta_a$, $\eta_c$). The current is then abruptly switched off ($I=0$). At the exact moment of interruption, the $IR_{\text{internal}}$ term vanishes instantly, while the other potential contributions, having slower relaxation times, persist. The potential is observed to drop instantaneously to a value $V_{off} = E_{\text{potential}}$. The magnitude of this instantaneous drop is therefore a direct measurement of the [ohmic drop](@entry_id:272464):

$$ \Delta V_{\text{instantaneous}} = V_{on} - V_{off} = IR_{\text{internal}} $$

From this, the internal resistance can be calculated simply as $R_{\text{internal}} = (V_{on} - V_{off}) / I$. This method is widely used for characterizing the internal resistance of batteries and other electrochemical devices [@problem_id:1584755].

#### Three-Electrode Systems and Uncompensated Resistance

In fundamental electrochemical studies, where the goal is to measure the precise kinetics of an electrode reaction, a **three-electrode configuration** is used. It consists of a **[working electrode](@entry_id:271370) (WE)** where the reaction of interest occurs, a **[counter electrode](@entry_id:262035) (CE)** to complete the circuit, and a **[reference electrode](@entry_id:149412) (RE)** to measure the WE potential. A device called a **[potentiostat](@entry_id:263172)** controls the potential between the WE and RE, while passing current between the WE and CE.

By placing the RE tip very close to the WE, the potentiostat can measure and control the WE potential without including the large potential drop across the bulk of the electrolyte between the WE and CE. However, it is physically impossible to place the RE tip exactly at the WE surface. There is always a small column of electrolyte between the WE and the RE tip. The resistance of this small volume of electrolyte is called the **[uncompensated resistance](@entry_id:274802)**, $R_u$. The potential measured by the potentiostat, $E_{\text{app}}$, is therefore not the true potential at the electrode surface, $E_{\text{true}}$, but is distorted by the iR drop across this [uncompensated resistance](@entry_id:274802):

$$ E_{\text{app}} = E_{\text{true}} + I R_u $$

To minimize this artifact, electrochemists use a **Luggin-Haber capillary**, which is a fine tube containing the reference electrode's salt bridge, allowing its tip to be positioned reproducibly and very close to the WE surface. Moving the capillary tip from a distance of several millimeters to a fraction of a millimeter can reduce the measured iR drop by an order of magnitude or more, greatly improving the accuracy of the potential measurement [@problem_id:1584769].

Even with careful placement, some [uncompensated resistance](@entry_id:274802) always remains. Its effects are particularly noticeable in techniques like **Cyclic Voltammetry (CV)**. For a reversible [redox](@entry_id:138446) couple, the theoretical separation between the anodic and cathodic peak potentials, $\Delta E_p = E_{p,a} - E_{p,c}$, is approximately $59/n$ mV at room temperature, where $n$ is the number of electrons transferred. The presence of $R_u$ artificially increases this separation. The observed [peak separation](@entry_id:271130) becomes $\Delta E_{p, \text{obs}} = \Delta E_{p, \text{ideal}} + (i_{p,a} + |i_{p,c}|)R_u$. By measuring the deviation from the ideal [peak separation](@entry_id:271130), one can calculate the value of the [uncompensated resistance](@entry_id:274802), $R_u$ [@problem_id:1584762].

### Dynamic Effects: The $R_u C_{dl}$ Time Constant

The consequences of [uncompensated resistance](@entry_id:274802) become even more pronounced in dynamic experiments performed at high speeds. The [electrode-electrolyte interface](@entry_id:267344) not only has the faradaic reaction pathway but also behaves like a capacitor, known as the **electrical double-layer capacitance**, $C_{dl}$. This capacitance exists in series with the [uncompensated resistance](@entry_id:274802), $R_u$, forming a simple **RC circuit**.

This RC circuit has a characteristic **time constant**, $\tau = R_u C_{dl}$. This time constant governs how quickly the true potential at the electrode surface, $E_{\text{true}}$, can respond to a change in the potential applied by the potentiostat, $E_{\text{app}}$. The system effectively acts as a [low-pass filter](@entry_id:145200).

When a potential is swept at a high scan rate, $v$, in a CV experiment, if the timescale of the experiment becomes comparable to or shorter than $\tau$, $E_{\text{true}}$ will lag significantly behind $E_{\text{app}}$. In a region with no faradaic reaction, the current is purely capacitive, $i(t) = C_{dl} (dE_{\text{true}}/dt)$. The relationship between the potentials is $E_{\text{app}}(t) = E_{\text{true}}(t) + i(t) R_u = E_{\text{true}}(t) + R_u C_{dl} (dE_{\text{true}}/dt)$. For a linear scan starting at $t=0$, the difference between the applied and true potentials can be shown to evolve as:

$$ \Delta E(t) = E_{\text{app}}(t) - E_{\text{true}}(t) = v \tau \left(1 - \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\tau}\right)\right) $$

This equation demonstrates that the lag is proportional to both the scan rate $v$ and the [time constant](@entry_id:267377) $\tau$. In experiments with highly resistive solvents (large $R_u$) or at very high scan rates, this potential lag can become substantial, reaching hundreds of millivolts [@problem_id:1584771]. This instrumental artifact distorts the shape of the [voltammogram](@entry_id:273718), causing peaks to shift, broaden, and diminish in height. If not properly recognized, these effects can be easily mistaken for slow [electrode kinetics](@entry_id:160813), leading to erroneous conclusions. A thorough understanding of resistance [overpotential](@entry_id:139429), from its simple ohmic origins to its dynamic RC filter effects, is therefore indispensable for the accurate measurement, interpretation, and design of electrochemical systems.
