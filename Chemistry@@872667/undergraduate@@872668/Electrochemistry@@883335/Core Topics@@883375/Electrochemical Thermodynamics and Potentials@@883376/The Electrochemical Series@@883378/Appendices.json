The species present in the solution are Ni²⁺(aq) ions, Br⁻(aq) ions, and water (H₂O) molecules.\n\nFirst, let's consider the cathode, where reduction occurs. The species that can be reduced are the cation, Ni²⁺(aq), and the solvent, H₂O(l).\n\nThe possible reduction half-reactions are:\n1.  Reduction of nickel ions: Ni²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Ni(s)\n2.  Reduction of water: 2H₂O(l) + 2e⁻ → H₂(g) + 2OH⁻(aq)\n\nWe are given the standard reduction potentials for these reactions:\n- $E^\\circ(\\text{Ni}^{2+}/\\text{Ni}) = -0.25$ V\n- $E^\\circ(\\text{H}_2\\text{O}/\\text{H}_2) = -0.83$ V (in neutral solution)\n\nAt the cathode, the reduction half-reaction with the more positive (or less negative) reduction potential is the one that will preferentially occur.

Therefore, solid nickel metal, Ni(s), will be produced at the cathode.\n\nNext, let's consider the anode, where oxidation occurs. The species that can be oxidized are the anion, Br⁻(aq), and the solvent, H₂O(l).\n\nThe possible oxidation half-reactions are:\n1.  Oxidation of bromide ions: 2Br⁻(aq) → Br₂(l) + 2e⁻\n2.  Oxidation of water: 2H₂O(l) → O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻\n\nTo determine which oxidation is more favorable, we compare the standard reduction potentials of the corresponding reverse (reduction) reactions.

Therefore, liquid bromine, Br₂(l), will be produced at the anode.\n\nCombining our findings:\n- At the cathode (reduction): Ni(s) is formed.\n- At the anode (oxidation): Br₂(l) is formed.\n\nThis corresponds to the choice: Nickel metal at the cathode and bromine liquid at the anode.
