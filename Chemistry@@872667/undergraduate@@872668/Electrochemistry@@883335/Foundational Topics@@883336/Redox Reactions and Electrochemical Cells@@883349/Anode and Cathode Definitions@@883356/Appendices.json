In the given Reaction 1, electrons appear on the product side, so Reaction 1 is an oxidation half-reaction.\n\nElectrochemical principle: Oxidation occurs at the anode and reduction occurs at the cathode, regardless of whether the cell is galvanic or electrolytic. Therefore, because Reaction 1 is an oxidation, the electrode where Reaction 1 occurs is the anode.\n\nDuring recharging, the battery is driven by an external power source and functions as an electrolytic cell. Electrolytic sign convention: the anode is the positive terminal and the cathode is the negative terminal. This follows because the external source pulls electrons away from the anode (making it positive) and pushes electrons toward the cathode (making it negative).\n\nCombining these facts, the electrode at which Reaction 1 occurs is the anode and, during recharging, it is the positive terminal. Hence the correct choice is D.
