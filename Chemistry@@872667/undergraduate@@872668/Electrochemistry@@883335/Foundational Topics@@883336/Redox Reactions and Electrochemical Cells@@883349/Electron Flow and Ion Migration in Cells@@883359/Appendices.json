The oxidation half-reaction at the anode is:\n$$Ni(s) \\rightarrow Ni^{2+}(aq) + 2e^{-}$$\n\nElectrons flow through the external circuit from anode to cathode; therefore, electrons flow from the nickel electrode to the silver electrode. This makes any statement asserting electron flow from silver to nickel, or electron flow through the salt bridge, incorrect, because the salt bridge carries ions, not electrons.\n\nCharge balance in the solutions is maintained by ion migration through the salt bridge. The general rule is that anions migrate into the anode compartment (where cations are produced) and cations migrate into the cathode compartment (where cations are consumed). In this cell, $Ni^{2+}$ accumulates in the anode compartment, so anions from the salt bridge, $\\text{NO}_3^{-}$, migrate into the nickel half-cell. At the cathode, $Ag^{+}$ is consumed, so cations from the salt bridge, $K^{+}$, migrate into the silver half-cell.\n\nTherefore:\n- Electrons do not migrate through the salt bridge (reject A).\n- $K^{+}$ does not migrate into the nickel half-cell and $\\text{NO}_3^{-}$ does not migrate into the silver half-cell (reject B).\n- $Ag^{+}$ does not migrate through the salt bridge into the nickel half-cell (reject C).\n- Electrons do not flow from silver to nickel through the external wire (reject E).\n- $\\text{NO}_3^{-}$ migrates into the nickel half-cell and $K^{+}$ migrates into the silver half-cell (accept D).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1558543"}, {"introduction": "Beyond cells driven by different chemical species, an electrochemical potential can also be generated by a concentration difference alone, as seen in concentration cells.

The sensor is constructed as a concentration cell at a constant temperature of $298.15$ K. It consists of two identical pure copper electrodes. The first electrode serves as a reference and is immersed in a solution of copper(II) sulfate ($\\text{CuSO}_4$) with a fixed concentration of $0.50$ M.

Because the reservoir electrode is the anode, electrons flow from the sensing electrode (reservoir) to the reference electrode, not the other way around. Therefore, statement B is false.\n\nTo maintain charge neutrality, ions from the salt bridge migrate to counter the charge changes in each compartment. At the anode (reservoir), oxidation produces $Cu^{2+}$, increasing positive charge; anions (from the bridge) migrate into the anode compartment. At the cathode (reference), reduction consumes $Cu^{2+}$, decreasing positive charge; cations (from the bridge) migrate into the cathode compartment.
