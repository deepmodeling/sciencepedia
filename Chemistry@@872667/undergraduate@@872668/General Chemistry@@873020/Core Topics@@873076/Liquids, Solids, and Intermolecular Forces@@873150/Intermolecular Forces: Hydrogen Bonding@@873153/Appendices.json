A hydrogen bond is formed when a hydrogen atom, covalently bonded to a highly electronegative atom (the hydrogen bond donor), is attracted to another nearby electronegative atom (the hydrogen bond acceptor).\n\nConsider a single molecule of 1,2-ethanediol, which has the chemical structure HO-CH$_2$-CH$_2$-OH. Imagine this single molecule is placed in a large volume of liquid water (H$_2$O), allowing it to form the maximum possible number of hydrogen bonds with the surrounding water molecules.\n\nLet $N_D$ be the maximum number of hydrogen bonds this single 1,2-ethanediol molecule can form where it acts as the hydrogen bond donor.\nLet $N_A$ be the maximum number of hydrogen bonds this single 1,2-ethanediol molecule can form where it acts as the hydrogen bond acceptor.\n\nAssuming no steric hindrance prevents the formation of any possible hydrogen bond, which of the following pairs of values for $(N_D, N_A)$ is correct?\n\nA. $(N_D = 2, N_A = 2)$\n\nB. $(N_D = 2, N_A = 4)$\n\nC. $(N_D = 4, N_A = 2)$\n\nD. $(N_D = 4, N_A = 4)$\n\nE. $(N_D = 1, N_A = 2)$\n\nF. $(N_D = 2, N_A = 1)$", "solution": "A hydrogen bond donor is an $X\\!-\\!H$ group where $X$ is highly electronegative; each hydrogen atom can donate at most one hydrogen bond. A hydrogen bond acceptor is a lone pair on an electronegative atom; each lone pair can accept at most one hydrogen bond. Under the stated assumption of no steric hindrance, all such potential sites can be simultaneously engaged.\n\nFor 1,2-ethanediol, HO-CH$_{2}$-CH$_{2}$-OH:\n- Donor sites: There are two hydroxyl groups, each with one O-H hydrogen.

Additional hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor sites, and higher polarity, further increase boiling point. Greater molar mass and surface area also increase London dispersion forces, but this effect is often outweighed by the presence or absence of hydrogen bonding.\n\nAnalyze each compound:\n- Ethane ($C_{2}H_{6}$): Nonpolar alkane; only London dispersion forces; very weak IMFs. Expected to have the lowest boiling point among the set.\n- Methoxyethane ($CH_{3}OCH_{2}CH_{3}$): An ether; possesses a significant molecular dipole and can accept hydrogen bonds but cannot donate them (no O–H bond). IMFs: dipole-dipole plus London dispersion. Boiling point higher than a comparable alkane but lower than a hydrogen-bonding alcohol. Although its molar mass is larger than ethanol, the lack of hydrogen-bond donation keeps its boiling point below that of ethanol.\n- Ethanol ($CH_{3}CH_{2}OH$): An alcohol; can both donate and accept hydrogen bonds due to the O–H group. IMFs: hydrogen bonding (dominant), dipole-dipole, and London dispersion. Boiling point higher than methoxyethane despite ethanol’s lower molar mass, because hydrogen bonding is stronger than mere dipole-dipole interactions.\n- 1,2-Ethanediol (ethylene glycol, $HOCH_{2}CH_{2}OH$): A diol with two O–H groups; can form multiple hydrogen bonds per molecule (both donors and acceptors), leading to extensive hydrogen-bond networks and high polarity. IMFs: very strong hydrogen bonding plus dipole-dipole and London dispersion. Highest boiling point among the set.\n\nTherefore, the increasing order of boiling points is:\nEthane  Methoxyethane  Ethanol  1,2-Ethanediol.\n\nMatch with the given options:\nThis corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2156815"}, {"introduction": "The mere presence of hydrogen-bonding groups is not the whole story; their spatial arrangement is also critical. This problem introduces a more nuanced concept by comparing two isomers where hydrogen bonding can occur either *between* separate molecules (intermolecular) or *within* a single molecule (intramolecular) [@problem_id:1999119]. Understanding this distinction is key to explaining surprising differences in physical properties like volatility and boiling point.", "problem": "A chemist is tasked with separating a mixture of two structural isomers of hydroxybenzaldehyde: 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde and 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde. In 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, the hydroxyl (-OH) group and the aldehyde (-CHO) group are attached to adjacent carbon atoms on the benzene ring (the 1,2 or *ortho* positions). In 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, these two groups are attached to carbon atoms on opposite sides of the benzene ring (the 1,4 or *para* positions). The chemist plans to use a separation technique that relies on differences in volatility, where the more volatile component will vaporize at a lower temperature.\n\nBased on the principles of intermolecular forces, which isomer is expected to be more volatile, and what is the primary reason for this difference in volatility?\n\nA. 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde is more volatile because its linear structure minimizes steric hindrance, weakening London dispersion forces.\n\nB. 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde is more volatile because it can form stable intramolecular hydrogen bonds, which reduces the extent of intermolecular hydrogen bonding between molecules.\n\nC. 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde is more volatile because the aldehyde group's electron-withdrawing effect is stronger at the para position, reducing the polarity of the O-H bond and weakening hydrogen bonding.\n\nD. 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde is more volatile because the proximity of the two functional groups leads to repulsive electronic interactions that raise the molecule's ground state energy, making it easier to vaporize.\n\nE. Both isomers have identical volatility because they have the same molecular formula and thus the same molar mass and number of electrons, leading to identical intermolecular forces.", "solution": "Volatility at a fixed temperature is determined by the equilibrium vapor pressure. From the Clausius–Clapeyron relation, assuming $\\Delta H_{vap}$ is approximately temperature-independent over a small range,\n$$\n\\ln p = -\\frac{\\Delta H_{vap}}{R T} + C,\n$$\nso, at fixed $T$, a smaller $\\Delta H_{vap}$ yields a larger $p$ and hence higher volatility.\n\nThe enthalpy of vaporization is primarily governed by the cohesive intermolecular interactions in the liquid. Writing the cohesive contribution schematically as\n$$\n\\Delta H_{vap} \\approx U_{L} + U_{D} + U_{HB},\n$$\nwhere $U_{L}$ is the London dispersion contribution, $U_{D}$ the dipole–dipole contribution, and $U_{HB}$ the hydrogen-bonding contribution, structural isomers with the same molecular formula typically have similar $U_{L}$ and comparable $U_{D}$, while $U_{HB}$ can differ substantially depending on hydrogen-bonding topology.\n\nFor 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (ortho), the $-OH$ and $-CHO$ groups are adjacent, allowing the formation of a stable intramolecular hydrogen bond that closes a six-membered ring. This intramolecular hydrogen bonding sequesters the hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor within the same molecule, thereby reducing their availability for intermolecular hydrogen bonding in the liquid.
