According to the principle of conservation of energy, the total heat change within the system is zero. This means that the heat lost by the hot iron ($q_{\\text{Fe}}$) is equal to the heat gained by the ethanol ($q_{\\text{EtOH}}$). We can express this relationship as:\n$$q_{\\text{Fe}} + q_{\\text{EtOH}} = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad -q_{\\text{Fe}} = q_{\\text{EtOH}}$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the heat is lost by the iron.\n\nFirst, let's define the heat transfer for each component.\n\nThe iron cools down from its unknown initial temperature, $T_{i, \\text{Fe}}$, to the final temperature of the system. Since the ethanol is at its boiling point and some of it vaporizes without all of it boiling away, the final temperature of the system must be the boiling point of ethanol. Thus, the final temperature is $T_f = T_{b, \\text{EtOH}} = 78.4$ °C. The heat lost by the iron is sensible heat, calculated using the formula $q = mc\\Delta T$:\n$$q_{\\text{Fe}} = m_{\\text{Fe}} c_{s, \\text{Fe}} (T_f - T_{i, \\text{Fe}})$$\n\nThe heat gained by the ethanol is used exclusively to convert a portion of the liquid into gas at a constant temperature (its boiling point). This is latent heat of vaporization, calculated using the formula $q = n\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}$. We first need to find the number of moles of ethanol that vaporized.\n$$n_{\\text{EtOH}} = \\frac{m_{\\text{EtOH, vaporized}}}{M_{\\text{EtOH}}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$n_{\\text{EtOH}} = \\frac{3.15 \\text{ g}}{46.07 \\text{ g⋅mol⁻¹}} \\approx 0.0683742 \\text{ mol}$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat absorbed by the ethanol. We must convert the enthalpy of vaporization from kJ/mol to J/mol to be consistent with the units of specific heat.\n$$\\Delta H_{\\text{vap, EtOH}} = 38.6 \\text{ kJ⋅mol⁻¹} \\times \\frac{1000 \\text{ J}}{1 \\text{ kJ}} = 38600 \\text{ J⋅mol⁻¹}$$\n$$q_{\\text{EtOH}} = n_{\\text{EtOH}} \\Delta H_{\\text{vap, EtOH}} = (0.0683742 \\text{ mol}) \\times (38600 \\text{ J⋅mol⁻¹}) \\approx 2639.24 \\text{ J}$$\nNote that the total initial mass of ethanol (150. g) is not directly needed for this calculation, other than to confirm that not all of it vaporized.\n\nNow we can set up the main energy balance equation:\n$$-q_{\\text{Fe}} = q_{\\text{EtOH}}$$\n$$-(m_{\\text{Fe}} c_{s, \\text{Fe}} (T_f - T_{i, \\text{Fe}})) = q_{\\text{EtOH}}$$\n$$m_{\\text{Fe}} c_{s, \\text{Fe}} (T_{i, \\text{Fe}} - T_f) = q_{\\text{EtOH}}$$\n\nWe can now solve for the initial temperature of the iron, $T_{i, \\text{Fe}}$:\n$$T_{i, \\text{Fe}} - T_f = \\frac{q_{\\text{EtOH}}}{m_{\\text{Fe}} c_{s, \\text{Fe}}}$$\n$$T_{i, \\text{Fe}} = T_f + \\frac{q_{\\text{EtOH}}}{m_{\\text{Fe}} c_{s, \\text{Fe}}}$$\n\nSubstitute the known numerical values into this equation:\n$$T_{i, \\text{Fe}} = 78.4 \\text{ °C} + \\frac{2639.24 \\text{ J}}{(45.5 \\text{ g}) \\times (0.449 \\text{ J⋅g⁻¹⋅°C⁻¹})}$$\n$$T_{i, \\text{Fe}} = 78.4 \\text{ °C} + \\frac{2639.24}{20.4295} \\text{ °C}$$\n$$T_{i, \\text{Fe}} = 78.4 \\text{ °C} + 129.187 \\text{ °C}$$\n$$T_{i, \\text{Fe}} = 207.587 \\text{ °C}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\nThe calculated value is 207.587 °C. Rounding this to three significant figures gives 208 °C.\n\nLet's verify the significant figures for the addition step. The temperature change, $\\Delta T = 129.187 \\text{ °C}$, is calculated from values with three significant figures ($m_{\\text{Fe}}$, $m_{\\text{EtOH, vaporized}}$, $c_{s, \\text{Fe}}$, $\\Delta H_{\\text{vap, EtOH}}$), so it should be reported to three significant figures, i.e., 129 °C. The uncertainty is in the units place. The initial temperature measurement, $T_f = 78.4$ °C, has its uncertainty in the tenths place. When adding $78.4 + 129$, the result should be rounded to the least precise decimal place, which is the units place of 129.\n$$78.4 + 129 = 207.4$$\nRounding to the units place gives 207 °C.\nHowever, to avoid intermediate rounding errors, it is best practice to use the unrounded value in the sum: $78.4 + 129.187 = 207.587$. Again, the sum is limited by the precision of 129, which is uncertain in the units place. Therefore, the final result should be rounded to the units place, which gives 208 °C. This result also has three significant figures, satisfying the prompt's instruction. We will proceed with 208 °C.\nFinal calculation: $T_{i, \\text{Fe}} = 207.587 \\text{ °C} \\approx 208 \\text{ °C}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{208}$$", "id": "2011791"}, {"introduction": "This final practice presents a more complex scenario where the final state of the system is not immediately known and must be deduced through careful analysis.
