To characterize its phase behavior, a series of experiments are conducted. The following observations are recorded:\n\n1.  At a constant pressure of $1.00$ atm, Cryostatin-V transitions from a solid to a liquid (melts) at a temperature of $25.0^\\circ\\text{C}$.\n2.  At the same constant pressure of $1.00$ atm, the liquid Cryostatin-V transitions to a gas (boils) at a temperature of $120.0^\\circ\\text{C}$.\n3.  Further experiments reveal that the liquid phase of Cryostatin-V is not stable at any pressure below $0.50$ atm. In this low-pressure region, the solid form transitions directly to a gas upon heating.\n4.  Density measurements confirm that, like most substances, the solid form of Cryostatin-V is denser than its liquid form.\n\nThe triple point of a substance is the unique set of temperature and pressure ($T_{tp}$, $P_{tp}$) at which the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases can coexist in thermodynamic equilibrium. Based on the experimental observations, which of the following options most accurately describes the coordinates of the triple point for Cryostatin-V?\n\nA. $T_{tp} < 25.0^\\circ\\text{C}$ and $P_{tp} \\ge 0.50$ atm\n\nB. $T_{tp} > 25.0^\\circ\\text{C}$ and $P_{tp} \\ge 0.50$ atm\n\nC. $T_{tp} < 25.0^\\circ\\text{C}$ and $P_{tp} < 0.50$ atm\n\nD.

Observation 3 states that the liquid phase “is not stable at any pressure below $0.50$ atm,” which implies that for all $P<0.50$ atm no liquid exists at any temperature. Therefore,\n$$P_{tp} \\ge 0.50\\ \\text{atm}.$$\nMoreover, Observation 2 shows that at $P=1.00$ atm the liquid is stable over a finite temperature interval (it boils at $120.0^\\circ\\text{C}$), and Observation 1 shows it also melts at $25.0^\\circ\\text{C}$; thus at $P=1.00$ atm a liquid region exists. At the triple point pressure, the liquid region collapses to a single point, so $P_{tp}$ cannot equal $1.00$ atm. Hence,\n$$0.50\\ \\text{atm} \\le P_{tp} < 1.00\\ \\text{atm}.$$\n\nTo determine the sign of $T_{tp}-25.0^\\circ\\text{C}$, use the Clausius–Clapeyron (more generally, Clapeyron) relation for the solid–liquid equilibrium line:\n$$\\frac{dP}{dT}=\\frac{L_{fus}}{T\\,\\Delta v},$$\nwhere $\\Delta v=v_{\\text{liq}}-v_{\\text{sol}}$. Observation 4 states the solid is denser than the liquid, so $v_{\\text{sol}}<v_{\\text{liq}}$, hence $\\Delta v>0$. With $L_{fus}>0$ and $T>0$, it follows that\n$$\\frac{dP}{dT}>0,$$\nso the solid–liquid coexistence line has positive slope in the $P$–$T$ plane, and equivalently $dT/dP>0$ along that line. Therefore, as pressure increases along the melting curve, the melting temperature increases.\n\nLet $T_{m}(P)$ denote the melting temperature at pressure $P$. Observation 1 gives $T_{m}(1.00\\ \\text{atm})=25.0^\\circ\\text{C}$.

Among the options, this is exactly captured by option A. Options B and D contradict the positive slope result for the fusion line (and D also incorrectly fixes $T_{tp}$ at the $1.00$ atm melting temperature), option C contradicts the absence of liquid below $0.50$ atm, and option E incorrectly treats $T_{tp}$ as unconstrained relative to $25.0^\\circ\\text{C}$ despite the density information fixing $T_{tp}<25.0^\\circ\\text{C}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2011488"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply reading a phase diagram, practical applications often require us to calculate the specific conditions for a phase transition.
