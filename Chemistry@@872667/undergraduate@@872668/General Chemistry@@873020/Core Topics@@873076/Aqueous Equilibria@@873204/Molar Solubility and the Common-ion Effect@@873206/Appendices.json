After the addition, the equilibrium concentration of chromate ions, $CrO_4^{2-}$, from the dissolved potassium chromate is maintained at 0.150 M.\n\nAssuming the system is at equilibrium at 25 °C, calculate the molar solubility of barium chromate in this solution.

This is a common-ion effect problem.\n\nFirst, we write the dissolution equilibrium for barium chromate:\n$$BaCrO_4(s) \\rightleftharpoons Ba^{2+}(aq) + CrO_4^{2-}(aq)$$\n\nThe solubility product constant, $K_{sp}$, for this equilibrium is given by the expression:\n$$K_{sp} = [Ba^{2+}][CrO_4^{2-}]$$\nThe given value is $K_{sp} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-10}$.\n\nLet 's' represent the molar solubility of $BaCrO_4$ in the presence of the common ion. This means that at equilibrium, the concentration of $Ba^{2+}$ ions produced from the dissolution of $BaCrO_4$ is equal to 's'.\n$$[Ba^{2+}] = s$$\n\nThe total concentration of chromate ions, $[CrO_4^{2-}]$, at equilibrium is the sum of the concentration from the added potassium chromate and the concentration from the dissolved barium chromate.\nPotassium chromate ($K_2CrO_4$) is a strong electrolyte, so it dissociates completely in solution. A 0.150 M $K_2CrO_4$ solution provides a chromate ion concentration of 0.150 M.\nThe dissolution of $BaCrO_4$ contributes an additional 's' to the chromate ion concentration.\nTherefore, the total equilibrium concentration of chromate ions is:\n$$[CrO_4^{2-}] = 0.150 + s$$\n\nNow, we substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the $K_{sp}$ expression:\n$$K_{sp} = (s)(0.150 + s)$$\n$$1.2 \\times 10^{-10} = s(0.150 + s)$$\n\nSince $K_{sp}$ is very small, we can anticipate that the molar solubility 's' will also be very small, especially in the presence of a common ion which shifts the equilibrium to the left (favoring the solid reactant). Thus, it is reasonable to assume that $s \\ll 0.150$ M. This allows us to simplify the expression:\n$$0.150 + s \\approx 0.150$$\n\nSubstituting this approximation back into the equation:\n$$1.2 \\times 10^{-10} \\approx s(0.150)$$\n\nNow, we can solve for 's':\n$$s \\approx \\frac{1.2 \\times 10^{-10}}{0.150}$$\n$$s \\approx 8.0 \\times 10^{-10}$$\n\nThe molar solubility 's' is approximately $8.0 \\times 10^{-10}$ mol/L.\n\nWe should verify our assumption that $s$ is negligible compared to 0.150 M. The value $8.0 \\times 10^{-10}$ is indeed much smaller than 0.150, so the approximation is valid.\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to two significant figures. The given $K_{sp}$ value ($1.2 \\times 10^{-10}$) has two significant figures, and the concentration (0.150 M) has three. The result should be limited by the least precise value, which is two significant figures. Our calculated value $8.0 \\times 10^{-10}$ is already expressed to two significant figures.
