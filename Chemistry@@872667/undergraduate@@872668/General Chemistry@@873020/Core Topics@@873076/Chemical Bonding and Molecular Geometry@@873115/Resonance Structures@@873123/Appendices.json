This matches the description.\n- Structure II (O single-bonded and negatively charged; C triple-bonded to N): O has three lone pairs and one single bond, $V=6$, $N_{\\text{nonbonding}}=6$, $N_{\\text{bonding}}=2$, so $\\text{FC}_{\\text{O}}=6-(6+1)=-1$.

C with four bonds total, $\\text{FC}_{\\text{C}}=0$ as above.

This matches the description.\n\nStability comparison:\n- Structure III has a $+1$ charge on the most electronegative atom (O) and a $-2$ charge on N. The presence of a high-magnitude charge and unfavorable placement of positive charge on O makes it strongly disfavored. Thus, III is the least significant contributor.\n- Comparing I and II: both have a single $-1$ formal charge and no $+1$ charge, so both are relatively favorable in terms of charge magnitude and separation. By the electronegativity criterion, placing the negative charge on the most electronegative atom is preferred. In II, the negative charge is on O; in I, it is on N. Since $\\chi_{\\text{O}} > \\chi_{\\text{N}}$, structure II is more stable than structure I.\n- The number of bonds is the same in I and II when counted as total bond order (both have four total bonds: I has two double bonds; II has one single plus one triple).

By analyzing the stability of potential reaction intermediates, we can often determine the major product of a chemical reaction. In this final practice, you will apply resonance principles to predict the outcome of an electrophilic substitution on indole, a foundational reaction in organic chemistry. This involves comparing the stability of the possible cationic intermediates (sigma complexes) to understand why one reaction pathway is overwhelmingly favored over another. [@problem_id:2197300]", "problem": "An organic chemist is investigating the electrophilic substitution reactions of indole, a bicyclic aromatic heterocycle. The structure of indole consists of a benzene ring fused to a pyrrole ring. For the purpose of this problem, the nitrogen atom is assigned position 1, the adjacent carbon in the five-membered ring is C2, and the next carbon is C3. The chemist wishes to predict the major product formed when indole reacts with a generic electrophile, $E^+$. The outcome of this kinetically controlled reaction is determined by the relative stability of the cationic intermediate (the sigma-complex) formed upon attack at either the C2 or C3 position.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly identifies the more stable intermediate and provides the best reason for its stability?\n\nA. The intermediate formed by attack at C2 is more stable because the positive charge can be delocalized onto the adjacent nitrogen atom, which is a powerful resonance donor.\n\nB. The intermediate formed by attack at C3 is more stable because one of its key resonance contributors maintains the aromatic sextet of the fused benzene ring while delocalizing the positive charge.\n\nC. The intermediate formed by attack at C3 is more stable because it has a greater total number of resonance structures compared to the intermediate from C2 attack.\n\nD. Both intermediates have comparable stability, leading to a nearly 1:1 mixture of C2 and C3 substituted products under typical reaction conditions.\n\nE. The intermediate formed by attack at C2 is more stable due to favorable inductive effects from the adjacent nitrogen atom, which outweighs resonance considerations.", "solution": "Electrophilic aromatic substitution of indole with a generic electrophile $E^{+}$ proceeds via formation of a sigma-complex (Wheland intermediate) after attack at a ring carbon, followed by deprotonation to restore aromaticity. The major product under kinetic control corresponds to the more stabilized sigma-complex formed in the rate-determining step.\n\nLabel the indole nitrogen as position 1, with C2 and C3 adjacent in the five-membered ring. Consider the two possible initial attacks:\n\n1) Attack at C3: Formation of the sigma-complex localizes the disruption of aromaticity in the five-membered ring. Crucially, there exists a resonance contributor in which the positive charge is delocalized over C3, C2, and the nitrogen, while the fused benzene ring retains its aromatic sextet (six $\\pi$ electrons). Thus, one key resonance structure preserves the aromaticity of the benzene ring, significantly stabilizing the intermediate. Additional resonance contributors place the positive charge on the nitrogen, which is acceptable because the nitrogen lone pair participates in the $\\pi$ system and can delocalize charge by resonance donation.\n\n2) Attack at C2: Formation of the sigma-complex tends to delocalize the positive charge into the benzene ring upon resonance. In doing so, the benzene ring loses its aromatic sextet in all important resonance contributors of this intermediate. There is no resonance form that simultaneously delocalizes the positive charge and preserves the full aromatic sextet of the benzene ring. As a result, the sigma-complex from C2 attack lacks the particularly stabilizing contributor present for C3 attack.\n\nBy the principle that aromatic stabilization (preservation of a $6\\pi$ sextet in the benzene ring) strongly lowers the energy of a resonance contributor, the sigma-complex formed by attack at C3 is more stabilized than that from attack at C2. This qualitative difference (quality of resonance, specifically presence of a contributor that maintains an aromatic sextet), not merely the count of resonance structures, governs the preference. Therefore, the best statement is that C3 attack gives the more stable intermediate because one of its key resonance contributors maintains the aromatic sextet of the fused benzene ring while delocalizing the positive charge.\n\nThis corresponds to option B. Options A and E incorrectly emphasize effects at C2; although the nitrogen can participate by resonance, C2 attack still forfeits the stabilizing benzene aromaticity in its contributors, and inductive effects from nitrogen do not outweigh this. Option C overemphasizes the number of resonance structures rather than their quality. Option D is inconsistent with the strong experimental preference for C3 substitution in indole under typical conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2197300"}]}
