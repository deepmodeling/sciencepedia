Carbon contributes $4$ valence electrons and hydrogen contributes $1$:\n$$\nN_{\\text{valence}} = 3 \\times 4 + 6 \\times 1 = 18.\n$$\n\n2) Lewis connectivity. Cyclopropane is a saturated three-carbon ring. The skeletal structure has three $C$ atoms connected in a ring by single bonds, and each $C$ bonded to two $H$ atoms. This yields $3$ $C-C$ single bonds and $6$ $C-H$ single bonds, for a total of $9$ single bonds.\n\n3) Electron usage check. Each single bond contains $2$ electrons, so $9$ bonds use $18$ electrons, exactly exhausting the $18$ valence electrons. Therefore, there are no electrons left for lone pairs on any atom.\n\n4) Octet and duet rules. Each carbon forms $4$ single bonds (two $C-C$ and two $C-H$), sharing $8$ electrons, thus satisfying the octet rule. Each hydrogen forms one single bond, sharing $2$ electrons, thus satisfying the duet rule appropriate for hydrogen.\n\n5) Formal charges. For carbon, with $0$ nonbonding electrons and $4$ bonds, the formal charge is\n$$\n\\text{FC}(C) = 4 - \\left(0 + \\frac{8}{2}\\right) = 0,\n$$\nand for hydrogen,\n$$\n\\text{FC}(H) = 1 - \\left(0 + \\frac{2}{2}\\right) = 0.\n$$\nThus, there are no formal charges.\n\n6) Assessment of the options:\n- A is incorrect because there are no lone pairs on carbon in the standard Lewis structure; all valence electrons are used in $\\sigma$ bonds.\n- B is imprecise because hydrogen does not follow the octet rule; it follows the duet rule, even though all atoms do have complete valence shells appropriate to their type.\n- C is incorrect: the electron count is $18$, not $20$, and cyclopropane does not contain a double bond.\n- D is correct: $18$ valence electrons, all carbons satisfy the octet, and there are no lone pairs.\n- E is incorrect: ring strain affects geometry and energy but does not prevent carbons from achieving an octet in the Lewis structure.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and complete description among the choices is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1987086"}, {"introduction": "Lewis structures are not just static drawings; they are powerful predictive tools that link electronic configuration to tangible molecular properties.

Lone pair-bond pair repulsion compresses the O-N-O bond angle below the trigonal planar ideal of $120^\\circ$ and, in particular, it is smaller than the linear angle of $\\text{NO}_2^+$.\n\nComparison:\n- Bond angles: $\\text{NO}_2^+$ is linear ($180^\\circ$, larger angle) whereas $\\text{NO}_2^-$ is bent ( $120^\\circ$, smaller angle), so the angle in $\\text{NO}_2^+$ is larger than in $\\text{NO}_2^-$.\n- Bond lengths: $\\text{NO}_2^+$ has N-O bond order $2$; $\\text{NO}_2^-$ has average N-O bond order $\\frac{3}{2}$.
