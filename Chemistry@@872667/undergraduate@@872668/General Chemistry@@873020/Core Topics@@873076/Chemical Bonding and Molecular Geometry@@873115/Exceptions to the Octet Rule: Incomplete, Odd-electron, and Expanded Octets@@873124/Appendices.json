{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Our first practice explores one of the most common exceptions to the octet rule: odd-electron species, often called radicals. The hydroxyl radical, $\\cdot OH$, is a crucial species in atmospheric chemistry, but with a total of seven valence electrons, it's impossible for both atoms to achieve a stable octet. This exercise [@problem_id:1993938] guides you through constructing the Lewis structure for this radical, forcing a decision about where to place the unpaired electron and the incomplete octet.", "problem": "The hydroxyl radical, denoted as $\\cdot OH$, is a critically important chemical intermediate in Earth's atmosphere, often referred to as the \"detergent of the troposphere\" due to its high reactivity and role in degrading pollutants. Despite its simple composition, its electronic structure represents an exception to the octet rule.\n\nConsider the neutral hydroxyl radical. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate description of its Lewis structure and electron distribution?\n\nA. The hydroxyl radical is an odd-electron species. The oxygen atom has an incomplete octet and bears one unpaired electron.\n\nB. The hydroxyl radical is an odd-electron species. The hydrogen atom bears the unpaired electron, and the oxygen atom has a full octet.\n\nC. The hydroxyl radical is best represented as an ion, $OH^{-}$, where the oxygen atom has a full octet and a negative formal charge.\n\nD. To satisfy the octet rule for oxygen, the structure contains a double bond between oxygen and hydrogen.\n\nE. The hydroxyl radical features an expanded octet on the oxygen atom to accommodate all valence electrons.", "solution": "We first count valence electrons to determine whether the neutral hydroxyl radical is an odd-electron species. Oxygen contributes 6 valence electrons and hydrogen contributes 1, so the total is\n$$\nN_{\\text{val}}=6+1=7,\n$$\nwhich is odd. Therefore, any Lewis representation must contain one unpaired electron.\n\nThe simplest skeletal structure places a single bond between oxygen and hydrogen. Assigning two electrons to the O–H bond leaves $7-2=5$ electrons to place as nonbonding electrons. To maximize octets, these are placed on the more electronegative atom, oxygen, resulting in two lone pairs (four electrons) and one unpaired electron on oxygen. Thus, oxygen has around it the bonding pair (counted as two), two lone pairs (four), and one unpaired electron, for a total of 7 electrons; this is an incomplete octet. Hydrogen has two electrons in the bond and satisfies the duet rule.\n\nWe verify formal charges to confirm neutrality. For oxygen, the formal charge is\n$$\n\\text{FC}(O)=6-\\bigl(\\text{nonbonding e}^{-}+\\tfrac{1}{2}\\times \\text{bonding e}^{-}\\bigr)=6-(5+1)=0.\n$$\nFor hydrogen,\n$$\n\\text{FC}(H)=1-\\bigl(0+\\tfrac{1}{2}\\times 2\\bigr)=0.\n$$\nHence both atoms are neutral, consistent with the neutral radical.\n\nWe now assess the options:\n- Option A states it is an odd-electron species with the unpaired electron on oxygen and an incomplete octet on oxygen. This matches the electron count and the reasonable placement of the radical on the more electronegative atom.\n- Option B incorrectly places the unpaired electron on hydrogen; in the hydroxyl radical the unpaired electron resides predominantly on oxygen.\n- Option C incorrectly represents the species as $OH^{-}$, which is not a neutral radical and would have a full octet on oxygen with a negative charge.\n- Option D proposes an O=H double bond; this would force hydrogen to have four electrons around it, violating the duet rule.\n- Option E suggests an expanded octet on oxygen, which is not possible for second-period elements and is incompatible with the total of 7 valence electrons.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is given by Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1993938"}, {"introduction": "Not all incomplete octets arise from an odd number of electrons; some elements, particularly from Group 13 like aluminum, can be stable in electron-deficient compounds. We will examine this principle using the hypothetical gaseous molecule aluminum(I) chloride, $AlCl$. This practice [@problem_id:1993951] illustrates how minimizing formal charges can lead to the most plausible structure, even when it results in a central atom having fewer than eight valence electrons.", "problem": "In high-temperature environments, such as in certain industrial refining processes or in stellar atmospheres, aluminum can form a diatomic gaseous molecule with chlorine, known as aluminum(I) chloride ($AlCl$). While aluminum typically exhibits a +3 oxidation state in its common compounds (e.g., $AlCl_3$), this less common species provides an interesting case for examining chemical bonding principles.\n\nBased on the rules for drawing Lewis structures and considering formal charges, analyze the electronic structure of the gaseous $AlCl$ molecule. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the aluminum atom in this molecule with respect to the octet rule?\n\nA. The aluminum atom has an incomplete octet.\n\nB. The aluminum atom has an expanded octet.\n\nC. The molecule is an odd-electron species, and thus the aluminum atom cannot satisfy the octet rule.\n\nD. Both atoms in the molecule satisfy the octet rule.\n\nE. The molecule violates the octet rule by having an expanded octet on the chlorine atom.", "solution": "We apply the Lewis structure rules and the formal charge criterion. The total valence electron count is given by\n$$V_{\\text{tot}}=V_{\\text{Al}}+V_{\\text{Cl}}=3+7=10.$$\nConnect Al and Cl with a single bond (2 electrons). Assign the remaining electrons to satisfy the octet of the more electronegative atom, chlorine. Place three lone pairs on Cl (6 electrons), which uses\n$$2+6=8$$\nelectrons, leaving\n$$10-8=2$$\nelectrons, which are placed as one lone pair on Al.\n\nElectron counts around each atom:\n- Around Al: one bonding pair (2 electrons) plus one lone pair (2 electrons) gives\n$$2+2=4,$$\nwhich is an incomplete octet.\n- Around Cl: one bonding pair (2 electrons) plus three lone pairs (6 electrons) gives\n$$2+6=8,$$\nwhich satisfies the octet.\n\nCheck formal charges using\n$$\\text{FC}=V-(N+\\frac{B}{2}),$$\nwhere $V$ is the valence electron count, $N$ is the number of nonbonding electrons, and $B$ is the number of bonding electrons around the atom.\n- For Al: $V=3$, $N=2$, $B=2$, so\n$$\\text{FC}(\\text{Al})=3-\\left(2+\\frac{2}{2}\\right)=3-(2+1)=0.$$\n- For Cl: $V=7$, $N=6$, $B=2$, so\n$$\\text{FC}(\\text{Cl})=7-\\left(6+\\frac{2}{2}\\right)=7-(6+1)=0.$$\nThus the single-bond structure has zero formal charges and is favored.\n\nConsider alternatives:\n- With a double bond, electrons around Al would be 4 (from two bonds) plus 2 (lone pair) equals 6, still short of an octet, and the formal charges become unfavorable:\n$$\\text{FC}(\\text{Al})=3-\\left(2+\\frac{4}{2}\\right)=3-(2+2)=-1,\\quad \\text{FC}(\\text{Cl})=7-\\left(4+\\frac{4}{2}\\right)=7-(4+2)=1.$$\n- A triple bond would force large formal charges:\n$$\\text{FC}(\\text{Al})=3-\\left(2+\\frac{6}{2}\\right)=3-(2+3)=-2,\\quad \\text{FC}(\\text{Cl})=7-\\left(2+\\frac{6}{2}\\right)=7-(2+3)=2,$$\nand is therefore not favored. Moreover, the total electron count is 10, an even number, so the species is not odd-electron.\n\nTherefore, the best Lewis structure has Al with an incomplete octet, Cl with a complete octet, and zero formal charges. The correct choice is that Al has an incomplete octet.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1993951"}, {"introduction": "Perhaps the most striking exceptions are hypervalent compounds, where a central atom expands its valence shell to hold more than eight electrons, a phenomenon possible for elements in the third period and below.
