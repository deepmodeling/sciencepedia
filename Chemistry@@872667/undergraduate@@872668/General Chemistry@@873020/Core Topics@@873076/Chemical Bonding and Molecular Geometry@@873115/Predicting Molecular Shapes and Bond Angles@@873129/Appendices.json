Three electron domains arrange in a trigonal planar geometry with ideal bond angles of $120^{\\circ}$, consistent with $sp^{2}$ hybridization.\n\nHowever, not all electron domains repel equally: a double bond has greater electron density than a single bond and therefore exerts a stronger repulsive effect. In a trigonal planar arrangement with one double bond and two single bonds, the stronger double-bond domain pushes the adjacent single-bond domains slightly farther away from itself. As a result, the C–H and C–O bond angles (i.e., $\\angle \\text{HCO}$ and $\\angle \\text{OCH}$) become slightly greater than $120^{\\circ}$, while the angle between the two single bonds, $\\angle \\text{HCH}$, must correspondingly become slightly less than $120^{\\circ}$.\n\nQuantitatively, let each $\\angle \\text{HCO}$ angle be $120^\\circ + \\delta$ with $\\delta > 0$ due to the stronger double-bond repulsion.

The relationship between the angles cannot be predicted by theory and must be determined experimentally.", "solution": "The problem asks us to compare the $\\angle \\text{H-C-H}$ and $\\angle \\text{F-C-F}$ bond angles in difluoromethane, $CH_2F_2$.\n\nFirst, we determine the basic geometry using Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory. The central carbon atom forms single bonds with four other atoms (two H and two F) and has no lone pairs. This corresponds to four electron domains, leading to an electron geometry that is tetrahedral. If all substituents were identical, the bond angles would all be the ideal tetrahedral angle of $109.5^\\circ$. However, since the substituents (H and F) are different, deviations from this ideal angle are expected.\n\nTo predict the direction of these deviations, we must use a more refined model than simple VSEPR. Bent's rule provides the necessary insight. Bent's rule states that atomic s-character tends to concentrate in orbitals directed towards more electropositive substituents.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the $CH_2F_2$ molecule. We compare the electronegativities of the substituents attached to the central carbon atom. Fluorine is the most electronegative element, so it is much more electronegative than hydrogen. Therefore, hydrogen is the more electropositive substituent relative to fluorine.\n\nAccording to Bent's rule:\n1.  The hybrid orbitals on the carbon atom that are used to form bonds with the more electropositive hydrogen atoms will have a higher percentage of s-character.\n2.  Conversely, the hybrid orbitals on the carbon atom used to form bonds with the more electronegative fluorine atoms will have a lower percentage of s-character (and consequently, a higher percentage of p-character).\n\nThe next step is to relate the s-character of the bonding orbitals to the angle between them. The angle between hybrid orbitals increases as their s-character increases. For example, the angle between two $sp^3$ orbitals (25% s-character) is $109.5^\\circ$, while the angle between two $sp^2$ orbitals (33.3% s-character) is $120^\\circ$.\n\nApplying this relationship to our molecule:\n- The C-H bonds are formed using carbon hybrid orbitals with increased s-character (i.e., greater than 25%). Therefore, the angle between these two orbitals, the $\\angle \\text{H-C-H}$ bond angle, will be larger than the ideal tetrahedral angle of $109.5^\\circ$.\n- The C-F bonds are formed using carbon hybrid orbitals with decreased s-character (i.e., less than 25%). Therefore, the angle between these two orbitals, the $\\angle \\text{F-C-F}$ bond angle, will be smaller than the ideal tetrahedral angle of $109.5^\\circ$.\n\nFrom this reasoning, we can conclude that the $\\angle \\text{H-C-H}$ bond angle is larger than the $\\angle \\text{F-C-F}$ bond angle.\n\nIt is worth noting that a common misconception is to use a steric argument, where one might assume that the larger fluorine atoms repel each other more strongly than the smaller hydrogen atoms, leading to the incorrect conclusion that $\\angle \\text{F-C-F} > \\angle \\text{H-C-H}$. However, the electronic effect described by Bent's rule is the dominant factor determining the bond angles in this case. Experimental data confirms this prediction: the $\\angle \\text{H-C-H}$ angle in difluoromethane is approximately $111.9^\\circ$, while the $\\angle \\text{F-C-F}$ angle is approximately $108.3^\\circ$.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that the $\\angle \\text{H-C-H}$ bond angle is larger than the $\\angle \\text{F-C-F}$ bond angle.
