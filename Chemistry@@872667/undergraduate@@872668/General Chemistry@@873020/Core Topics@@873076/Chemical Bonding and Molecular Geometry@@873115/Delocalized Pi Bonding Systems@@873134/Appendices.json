A simplified Lewis structure model for this ion might suggest that it contains two different types of carbon-oxygen bonds: single bonds and double bonds. However, experimental measurements, such as those from X-ray crystallography, reveal that all three carbon-oxygen bonds in the carbonate ion are identical in length and strength.

In each canonical structure, one C–O bond is a double bond and the other two are single bonds, with the negative charge localized on the singly bonded oxygens. Because the three resonance structures are equivalent, they contribute equally to the resonance hybrid.\n\nConsider a specific C–O bond.

Protons attached to C1 and C5 are equally and most acidic.\n\nG. All protons attached to carbon atoms are of roughly equal acidity.", "solution": "To determine the most acidic proton in 1,3-pentadiene, we must analyze the stability of the conjugate base that results from the deprotonation at each unique carbon position. The principle is that a more stable conjugate base corresponds to a stronger acid, and thus a more acidic proton. The structure is $\\text{CH}_2=\\text{CH}-\\text{CH}=\\text{CH}-\\text{CH}_3$, where carbons are numbered C1 through C5.\n\nLet's examine the conjugate base formed by removing a proton from each distinct type of carbon atom.\n\nCase 1: Deprotonation at C1, C2, C3, or C4.\nThe protons on carbons C1, C2, C3, and C4 are all vinylic protons, meaning they are attached to sp2-hybridized carbon atoms that are part of a double bond.\nLet's consider removing a proton from C1:\n$\\text{CH}_2=\\text{CH}-\\text{CH}=\\text{CH}-\\text{CH}_3 \\rightarrow [\\ddot{\\text{C}}\\text{H}=\\text{CH}-\\text{CH}=\\text{CH}-\\text{CH}_3]^- + \\text{H}^+$\nThe resulting conjugate base is a vinylic carbanion. The lone pair of electrons resides in an sp2 hybrid orbital on C1. This sp2 orbital lies in the plane of the molecule and is orthogonal (perpendicular) to the pi-system's p-orbitals. Because of this orthogonal orientation, the lone pair cannot overlap with the pi system, and the negative charge is localized entirely on the C1 atom. There is no resonance stabilization for this carbanion. The same logic applies to deprotonation at C2, C3, and C4. Vinylic carbanions are known to be very unstable, meaning the corresponding vinylic protons are not very acidic.\n\nCase 2: Deprotonation at C5.\nThe protons on C5 are allylic protons. C5 is an sp3-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to the C3=C4 double bond. Let's examine the deprotonation at this site:\n$\\text{CH}_2=\\text{CH}-\\text{CH}=\\text{CH}-\\text{CH}_3 \\rightarrow [\\text{CH}_2=\\text{CH}-\\text{CH}=\\text{CH}-\\ddot{\\text{C}}\\text{H}_2]^- + \\text{H}^+$\nThe resulting carbanion is the pentadienyl anion. Upon deprotonation, the C5 atom re-hybridizes from sp3 to sp2. The lone pair of electrons now occupies a p-orbital. This p-orbital is parallel to the p-orbitals of the adjacent pi system (C1 through C4), allowing for electron delocalization through resonance. The resonance structures for this conjugate base delocalize the negative charge across carbons C1, C3, and C5:\n\n*   Structure with charge on C5: $[\\text{CH}_2=\\text{CH}-\\text{CH}=\\text{CH}-\\ddot{\\text{C}}\\text{H}_2]^-$\n*   Structure with charge on C3: $[\\text{CH}_2=\\text{CH}-\\ddot{\\text{C}}\\text{H}-\\text{CH}=\\text{CH}_2]^-$\n*   Structure with charge on C1: $[\\ddot{\\text{C}}\\text{H}_2-\\text{CH}=\\text{CH}-\\text{CH}=\\text{CH}_2]^-$\n\nIn this conjugate base, the negative charge is delocalized over three different carbon atoms (C1, C3, and C5). This delocalization via resonance significantly stabilizes the carbanion.\n\nComparison and Conclusion:\nThe conjugate base formed by deprotonating C5 is a resonance-stabilized allylic-type carbanion (specifically, a pentadienyl anion). The conjugate bases formed by deprotonating C1, C2, C3, or C4 are localized, unstable vinylic carbanions. Since the formation of the pentadienyl anion is far more favorable due to extensive resonance stabilization, the parent protons on C5 are significantly more acidic than any of the vinylic protons on C1, C2, C3, or C4.\n\nTherefore, the most acidic proton in 1,3-pentadiene is located on C5.
