The structural formula of glycylglycine can be represented in a condensed form as $H_2N-CH_2-C(O)NH-CH_2-COOH$, where $C(O)$ indicates a carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom. You are tasked with determining the hybridization state of three specific atoms in this molecule:\n\n1.  The nitrogen atom of the terminal amino group (the leftmost nitrogen, in the $H_2N-$ group).\n2.  The nitrogen atom within the central amide linkage (in the $-C(O)NH-$ group).\n3.

In valence bond terms, an atom with four electron domains in localized $\\sigma$ bonds adopts $sp^3$ hybridization; three $\\sigma$ domains with a $p$ orbital reserved for $\\pi$ overlap (resonance) adopt $sp^2$.\n\n1) Terminal amino nitrogen ($H_{2}N-$): This nitrogen forms two $\\sigma$ bonds to H and one $\\sigma$ bond to C, and has one localized lone pair that is not conjugated with a neighboring $\\pi$ system (it is attached to a $CH_{2}$, not directly to a carbonyl). Thus it has four electron domains in $\\sigma$ framework and adopts $sp^3$ hybridization.\n\n2) Amide nitrogen in $-C(O)NH-$: The lone pair on the amide N is delocalized into the adjacent carbonyl via $p$–$p$ overlap, contributing to the $C-N$/$C=O$ resonance.

We wish to determine its preferred geometry by comparing the total energy of two plausible structures: a trigonal planar structure (associated with $sp^2$ hybridization) and a trigonal pyramidal structure (associated with $sp^3$ hybridization).\n\nTo do this, we use a simplified energy model that considers two main competing factors:\n\n1.  **Orbital Energy of the Unpaired Electron**: The energy of an electron depends on the orbital it occupies. We can approximate the energy of an electron in an $sp^n$ hybrid orbital as a weighted average of the energies of the constituent pure atomic orbitals, $E_{2s}$ and $E_{2p}$. For the central carbon atom, the energy required to promote an electron from the 2s orbital to the 2p orbital is given as $E_{promo} = E_{2p} - E_{2s} = 405 \\text{ kJ/mol}$. In the planar structure, the unpaired electron resides in a pure $p$ orbital. In the pyramidal structure, it resides in an $sp^3$ hybrid orbital. The energy of an electron in a hybrid orbital with s-fraction $f_s$ and p-fraction $f_p$ (where $f_s + f_p = 1$) is given by $E_{hyb} = f_s E_{2s} + f_p E_{2p}$.\n\n2.  **Inter-electron Repulsion**: Adopting a pyramidal geometry forces the three C-H bonding electron pairs closer together than in the optimal 120° arrangement of a planar structure. This introduces an electrostatic repulsion energy cost. For the methyl radical, this total repulsion cost for deforming from planar to pyramidal is estimated to be $E_{rep} = 108$ kJ/mol.\n\nCalculate the net energy change, $\\Delta E = E_{pyramidal} - E_{planar}$, which represents the energy difference between the pyramidal and planar configurations.
