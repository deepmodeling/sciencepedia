Its physical and chemical properties are a direct consequence of its electronic structure and molecular geometry. The molecule's connectivity is described as a methyl group ($-CH_3$) single-bonded to a nitrile group ($-CN$), which contains a carbon-nitrogen triple bond.\n\nUsing the principles of valence bond theory, identify the specific hybrid orbitals that overlap to form the sigma ($\\sigma$) bond between the two carbon atoms in the acetonitrile molecule.

It forms sigma bonds to three hydrogens and to $C_B$, for a total of four sigma bonds and no lone pairs. Four electron domains imply tetrahedral geometry, so $C_A$ adopts $sp^3$ hybridization. Thus $C_A$ has four equivalent $sp^3$ hybrid orbitals directed tetrahedrally; three overlap with H $1s$ orbitals, and the remaining one is available to overlap with an orbital on $C_B$.\n\n2) Consider the nitrile carbon $C_B$ in $-C\\equiv N$. It is sigma-bonded to $C_A$ and sigma-bonded to nitrogen as part of the $C\\equiv N$ triple bond, with two additional $\\pi$ bonds to nitrogen formed by unhybridized $p$ orbitals. Hence $C_B$ has two regions of electron density (two sigma bonds), implying linear geometry and $sp$ hybridization. Therefore $C_B$ has two $sp$ hybrid orbitals oriented $180^{\\circ}$ apart: one overlaps with an $sp$ (on N) to form the $\\sigma$ component of the $C\\equiv N$ bond, and the other overlaps with an $sp^3$ hybrid on $C_A$ to form the $C_A-C_B$ sigma bond.
