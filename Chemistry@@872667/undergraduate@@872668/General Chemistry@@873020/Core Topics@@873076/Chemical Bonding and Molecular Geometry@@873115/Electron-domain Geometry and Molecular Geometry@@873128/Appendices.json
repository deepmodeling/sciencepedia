One such compound is xenon dioxydifluoride, with the chemical formula $\\text{XeO}_2\\text{F}_2$. By analyzing the arrangement of valence electrons, one can predict the three-dimensional structure of this molecule. Assume that xenon (Xe) is the central atom to which the oxygen (O) and fluorine (F) atoms are bonded.

The total number of valence electrons is\n$$8 + 2\\cdot 6 + 2\\cdot 7 = 34,$$\nfrom xenon, two oxygens, and two fluorines, respectively.\n\nConnect Xe to two O and two F atoms with single bonds. This uses $4\\cdot 2=8$ electrons, leaving $34-8=26$ electrons to distribute as lone pairs on terminal atoms and possibly Xe. Completing octets on the two F atoms requires $2\\cdot 6=12$ electrons, and on the two singly bonded O atoms requires another $2\\cdot 6=12$ electrons, totaling $24$, leaving $26-24=2$ electrons, which reside as one lone pair on Xe.\n\nEvaluate formal charges to optimize the structure.

This yields two $\\text{Xe=O}$ double bonds, two $\\text{Xe-F}$ single bonds, and one lone pair on Xe, with all atoms having minimized formal charges (each O at zero).\n\nFor VSEPR purposes, each multiple bond counts as a single electron domain. Thus, the central Xe has $5$ electron domains: $2$ from $\\text{Xe=O}$, $2$ from $\\text{Xe-F}$, and $1$ lone pair. The electron-domain geometry is trigonal bipyramidal; with one lone pair, the molecular geometry is seesaw ($AX_4E$).

By VSEPR, the central atom A has five bonding pairs and possibly $L$ lone pairs; thus the total number of electron domains is $N=5+L$.\n\nThe relevant electron-domain and molecular geometries for $AX_5$ are:\n- For $L=0$ ($N=5$): trigonal bipyramidal electron and molecular geometry, i.e., $AX_5$ trigonal bipyramidal (option A).\n- For $L=1$ ($N=6$): octahedral electron geometry with one lone pair, giving a square pyramidal molecular geometry $AX_5E$ (option B).\n- For $L=2$ ($N=7$): pentagonal bipyramidal electron geometry with two lone pairs occupying axial positions, giving a pentagonal planar molecular geometry $AX_5E_2$ (option C).\n\nOptions D (trigonal pyramidal, $AX_3E$) and E (T-shaped, $AX_3E_2$) correspond to three bonded atoms, not five, and therefore contradict the given formula $AX_5$; they are invalid for this molecule.\n\nNext, we use the polarity condition.

For identical ligands, the axial bond dipoles cancel each other and the three equatorial bond dipoles cancel by $120^{\\circ}$ symmetry, giving $\\vec{\\mu}=\\vec{0}$. Therefore this geometry is nonpolar and inconsistent with the observed non-zero dipole.\n\n- Square pyramidal $AX_5E$ (option B) has point group $C_{4v}$. There is a unique axis (the pyramid axis) along which the vector sum of bond dipoles does not cancel; the absence of an inversion center and the asymmetry between the axial and basal positions ensure $\\vec{\\mu}\\neq\\vec{0}$. This is consistent with a polar molecule.\n\n- Pentagonal planar $AX_5E_2$ (option C) has point group $D_{5h}$. All five A–X bonds lie in one plane and are symmetrically arranged; the in-plane bond dipoles cancel by $72^{\\circ}$ rotational symmetry, and planarity precludes any out-of-plane component, so $\\vec{\\mu}=\\vec{0}$.
