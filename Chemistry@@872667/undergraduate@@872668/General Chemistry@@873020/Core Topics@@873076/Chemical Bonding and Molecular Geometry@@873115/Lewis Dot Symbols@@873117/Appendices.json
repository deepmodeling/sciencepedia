In their proposed structure, the central oxygen atom is connected to one hydrogen atom via a single covalent bond and to the other hydrogen atom via a double covalent bond. To complete its octet, the student places one lone pair of electrons on the oxygen atom.\n\nWhile this proposed structure contains several inconsistencies with the principles of chemical bonding, one of these represents a violation of a fundamental rule that makes the structure physically impossible. Which of the following options describes the most fundamental and non-negotiable rule violation in the student's proposed Lewis structure for water?\n\nA. The total number of valence electrons depicted in the structure is incorrect for a water molecule.\n\nB. The oxygen atom does not satisfy the octet rule.\n\nC. One of the hydrogen atoms does not satisfy the duet rule.\n\nD. The principle of minimizing formal charges is violated, as the oxygen atom has a non-zero formal charge.\n\nE.

For water, the total valence electrons are\n$$V_{\\text{total}}=V_{\\text{O}}+2V_{\\text{H}}=6+2\\times 1=8.$$\nIn the proposed structure, the electron accounting is one single bond ($2$ electrons), one double bond ($4$ electrons), and one lone pair on oxygen ($2$ electrons), totaling\n$$2+4+2=8.$$\nThus, option A is not violated.\n\n2) Octet rule on oxygen. The electrons around oxygen in the proposal are\n$$N_{\\text{around O}}=2\\ (\\text{lone pair})+2\\ (\\text{single bond})+4\\ (\\text{double bond})=8,$$\nso oxygen satisfies the octet. Thus, option B is not violated.\n\n3) Duet rule for hydrogen. Hydrogen has only the $1s$ orbital and can accommodate at most $2$ electrons; this is the strict duet rule. In the proposed double bond to hydrogen, hydrogen would be associated with $4$ bonding electrons (two shared pairs), which exceeds the duet limit of $2$. Therefore, the double bond to hydrogen is physically impossible. This is a fundamental, non-negotiable rule. Hence, option C is violated.\n\n4) Formal charges.

Asymmetry in a proposed structure is not a fundamental rule violation; molecules need not be perfectly symmetrical. Hence E is not the fundamental issue.\n\nTherefore, the most fundamental and non-negotiable violation is the duet rule for hydrogen, option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2002897"}, {"introduction": "Moving from identifying errors to building valid structures, this exercise focuses on the nitrite ion, $NO_2^-$.

Nitrogen contributes $5$, each oxygen contributes $6$, and the overall $-1$ charge adds $1$ extra electron, so\n$$N_{e} = 5 + 2 \\times 6 + 1 = 18.$$\nConstruct the Lewis skeleton with $N$ central and two $N$–$O$ single bonds (uses $4$ electrons), then distribute electrons to satisfy octets. Placing three lone pairs on each oxygen uses $12$ more electrons, leaving $2$ electrons, which are placed as one lone pair on nitrogen. Nitrogen then has only $6$ electrons around it, so convert one lone pair from an oxygen into a bonding pair to form one $N{=}O$ double bond and leave the other $N{-}O$ single.

This element forms a stable, neutral molecule with the chemical formula $XOF_4$, in which `X` acts as the central atom. Experimental analysis has determined that the molecular geometry of $XOF_4$ is square pyramidal. Based on this information, identify element `X` from the choices below.\n\nA. Selenium (Se)\n\nB. Bromine (Br)\n\nC. Krypton (Kr)\n\nD. Arsenic (As)\n\nE. Gallium (Ga)", "solution": "The problem asks us to identify an unknown element `X` from Period 4 based on the properties of the neutral molecule $XOF_4$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the given molecular geometry. The molecule $XOF_4$ is described as having a square pyramidal geometry. According to the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory, a square pyramidal geometry corresponds to the general formula $AX_5E_1$, where A is the central atom, X represents a bonded atom, and E represents a lone pair of electrons on the central atom. This means the central atom `X` is bonded to five other atoms and possesses one lone pair of electrons. The total number of electron domains around the central atom is the sum of bonding domains and lone pairs, which is $5 + 1 = 6$. A total of six electron domains corresponds to an octahedral electron geometry.\n\nNext, we establish a plausible bonding arrangement for the atoms in $XOF_4$. The central atom `X` is bonded to one oxygen atom and four fluorine atoms. To construct a valid Lewis structure, we aim to minimize the formal charges on all atoms. Fluorine, being the most electronegative element, almost invariably forms a single bond and has three lone pairs to complete its octet. Oxygen typically forms two bonds to achieve a neutral formal charge.\n\nBased on these preferences, we can propose a structure where the central atom `X` forms four single bonds with the four fluorine atoms and a double bond with the oxygen atom. This structure has five atoms bonded to `X`. To be consistent with the $AX_5E_1$ model derived from the square pyramidal geometry, the central atom `X` must also have one lone pair.\n\nNow, we can calculate the formal charge for each atom in this proposed structure to determine the number of valence electrons ($V_X$) required for element `X`. The formula for formal charge (FC) is:\n$$ \\text{FC} = (\\text{Number of valence electrons}) - (\\text{Number of non-bonding electrons}) - \\frac{1}{2}(\\text{Number of bonding electrons}) $$\n\nFor each of the four fluorine atoms, which have a single bond and 3 lone pairs (6 non-bonding electrons):\n$$ \\text{FC}(\\text{F}) = 7 - 6 - \\frac{1}{2}(2) = 0 $$\n\nFor the oxygen atom, which has a double bond and 2 lone pairs (4 non-bonding electrons):\n$$ \\text{FC}(\\text{O}) = 6 - 4 - \\frac{1}{2}(4) = 0 $$\n\nThe overall molecule $XOF_4$ is stated to be neutral, which means the sum of all formal charges must be zero.\n$$ \\text{FC}(\\text{X}) + \\text{FC}(\\text{O}) + 4 \\times \\text{FC}(\\text{F}) = 0 $$\n$$ \\text{FC}(\\text{X}) + 0 + 4 \\times 0 = 0 $$\nThis implies that the formal charge on the central atom `X` must also be zero.\n\nNow we apply the formal charge formula to atom `X`. In our proposed structure, `X` has one lone pair (2 non-bonding electrons), four single bonds, and one double bond. The total number of bonding electrons around `X` is $4 \\times 2 (\\text{from F}) + 4 (\\text{from O}) = 8 + 4 = 12$.\n$$ \\text{FC}(\\text{X}) = V_X - (\\text{Number of non-bonding electrons}) - \\frac{1}{2}(\\text{Number of bonding electrons}) = 0 $$\n$$ V_X - 2 - \\frac{1}{2}(12) = 0 $$\n$$ V_X - 2 - 6 = 0 $$\n$$ V_X = 8 $$\n\nThis result indicates that element `X` must have 8 valence electrons. The elements with 8 valence electrons belong to Group 18 of the periodic table, the noble gases. The problem states that `X` is in Period 4. The Period 4 element in Group 18 is Krypton (Kr).\n\nTherefore, the unknown element `X` is Krypton. This corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2002850"}]}
