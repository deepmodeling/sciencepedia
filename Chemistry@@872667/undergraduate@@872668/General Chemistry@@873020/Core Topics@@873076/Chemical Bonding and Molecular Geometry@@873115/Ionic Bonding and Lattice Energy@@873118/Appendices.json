The magnitude of the lattice energy is a key indicator of the strength of the ionic bonds. It can be qualitatively understood by a relationship derived from Coulomb's law: the magnitude of the lattice energy is primarily governed by two factors. It is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of the ionic charges ($Q_1$ and $Q_2$) and inversely proportional to the interionic distance ($r$), which is the sum of the radii of the cation and anion.\n\nAn analyst has a list of four ionic compounds: LiCl, LiBr, KBr, and CaO. They also have a list of experimentally determined magnitudes for the lattice energies for these compounds, but the list has been scrambled. The values are: 671 kJ/mol, 807 kJ/mol, 834 kJ/mol, and 3414 kJ/mol.\n\nBased on your understanding of periodic trends and the factors influencing lattice energy, determine the correct pairing.

For LiCl, LiBr, and KBr, the ions are monovalent, so $|Q_{1}Q_{2}|=1$. For CaO, the ions are divalent, so $|Q_{1}Q_{2}|=4$. Therefore, all else equal, CaO must have a much larger $|U_{\\text{latt}}|$ than the alkali halides.\n\nStep 2: Compare interionic distances among the monovalent salts. The interionic distance is $r=r_{\\text{cation}}+r_{\\text{anion}}$.\n- Cation sizes increase down a group, so $r_{\\text{Li}^{+}}r_{\\text{K}^{+}}$.\n- Anion sizes increase down a group, so $r_{\\text{Cl}^{-}}r_{\\text{Br}^{-}}$.\nHence,\n$$r(\\text{LiCl})=r_{\\text{Li}^{+}}+r_{\\text{Cl}^{-}}r(\\text{LiBr})=r_{\\text{Li}^{+}}+r_{\\text{Br}^{-}}r(\\text{KBr})=r_{\\text{K}^{+}}+r_{\\text{Br}^{-}}.$$\nBy the inverse dependence on $r$, the lattice energy magnitudes order as\n$$|U_{\\text{latt}}|(\\text{LiCl})|U_{\\text{latt}}|(\\text{LiBr})|U_{\\text{latt}}|(\\text{KBr}).$$\n\nStep 3: Assign the given numerical magnitudes consistent with these trends.
