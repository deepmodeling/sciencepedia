The reaction can be modeled by the elementary step $X \\rightarrow Products$. It is known from preliminary studies that the reaction order with respect to X is either first or second. To resolve this ambiguity, the student conducts two experiments at a constant temperature.\n\nIn the first experiment, the initial concentration of compound X is set to $[X]_0 = 0.500$ mol/L. The time required for the concentration of X to decrease to half of its initial value (the half-life) is measured to be $t_{1/2,1} = 225$ seconds.\n\nIn the second experiment, the initial concentration of X is adjusted to $[X]_0 = 0.250$ mol/L. The half-life is subsequently measured to be $t_{1/2,2} = 450$ seconds.\n\nBased on these experimental results, which of the following statements correctly identifies the order of the reaction and the value of the rate constant, $k$?\n\nA. The reaction is first-order, and the rate constant is $k = 3.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$.\n\nB. The reaction is first-order, and the rate constant is $k = 1.54 \\times 10^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$.\n\nC.
