The standard boiling point elevation formula, $\\Delta T_b = i K_b m$, works well for many solutions, but it is built on a key assumption: the solute must be non-volatile. This conceptual problem [@problem_id:1984368] challenges you to explain why this formula fails for a solution containing a volatile solute like ethanol, forcing a return to the first principles of vapor pressure to correctly predict the system's behavior.", "problem": "A student is tasked with predicting the boiling point of an aqueous solution prepared by dissolving a significant amount of ethanol, $\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_5\\text{OH}$, in water. The student uses the standard boiling point elevation formula for colligative properties, $\\Delta T_b = i K_b m$, where $\\Delta T_b$ is the change in boiling point, $i$ is the van't Hoff factor (assumed to be 1 for ethanol), $K_b$ is the ebullioscopic constant for water, and $m$ is the molality of the ethanol. Based on this calculation, the student predicts that the solution will boil at a temperature higher than the normal boiling point of pure water (100.00 °C at 1 atm).\n\nHowever, upon conducting the experiment carefully, the student is surprised to find that the solution actually begins to boil at a temperature *below* 100.00 °C. The student's calculations for molality and application of the formula were arithmetically correct.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for the discrepancy between the student's prediction and the experimental result?\n\nA. The van't Hoff factor for ethanol is not 1; it is significantly greater than 1 because ethanol molecules dissociate in water.\n\nB. The boiling point elevation formula, $\\Delta T_b = i K_b m$, is only valid for ideal solutions, and an ethanol-water mixture exhibits strong non-ideal behavior that suppresses the boiling point.\n\nC. The derivation of the boiling point elevation formula, $\\Delta T_b = i K_b m$, fundamentally assumes that the solute is non-volatile. Ethanol is a volatile substance that contributes its own vapor pressure to the system, which this formula neglects.\n\nD. The ebullioscopic constant, $K_b$, for water is only applicable for ionic solutes, and a different constant should have been used for a molecular solute like ethanol.\n\nE. The dissolution of ethanol in water is a strongly endothermic process, which cools the solution and lowers the energy required to reach the boiling point.", "solution": "The standard boiling point elevation relation $\\Delta T_{b} = i K_{b} m$ is derived under the fundamental assumption that the solute is non-volatile, so that it contributes no vapor to the gas phase. In that case, Raoult’s law for the solvent gives the solution vapor pressure as\n$$\nP_{\\text{solution}}(T) = x_{1} P_{1}^{*}(T),\n$$\nwhere $x_{1}$ is the mole fraction of the solvent (water) and $P_{1}^{*}(T)$ is the saturation vapor pressure of pure water at temperature $T$. For boiling at an external pressure $P_{\\text{ext}}$, the condition is $P_{\\text{solution}}(T_{b,\\text{soln}}) = P_{\\text{ext}}$. Because $x_{1}  1$, one requires $P_{1}^{*}(T_{b,\\text{soln}})  P_{\\text{ext}}$, which occurs at a higher temperature than the pure solvent’s normal boiling point $T_{b}^{(1)}$ satisfying $P_{1}^{*}(T_{b}^{(1)}) = P_{\\text{ext}}$. This leads to $\\Delta T_{b}  0$ and yields the formula $\\Delta T_{b} = i K_{b} m$.\n\nHowever, ethanol is a volatile solute. For a solution of two volatile components that behaves ideally, Dalton’s law and Raoult’s law give the total vapor pressure as\n$$\nP_{\\text{tot}}(T) = x_{1} P_{1}^{*}(T) + x_{2} P_{2}^{*}(T),\n$$\nwhere $x_{2}$ is the mole fraction of ethanol and $P_{2}^{*}(T)$ is the saturation vapor pressure of pure ethanol at temperature $T$. The boiling condition is\n$$\nx_{1} P_{1}^{*}(T_{b,\\text{mix}}) + x_{2} P_{2}^{*}(T_{b,\\text{mix}}) = P_{\\text{ext}}.\n$$\nLet $T_{b}^{(1)}$ denote the normal boiling point of pure water, so $P_{1}^{*}(T_{b}^{(1)}) = P_{\\text{ext}}$. Because $x_{2}  0$ and $P_{2}^{*}(T)  0$ for all relevant $T$, the relation\n$$\nx_{1} P_{1}^{*}(T_{b,\\text{mix}}) = P_{\\text{ext}} - x_{2} P_{2}^{*}(T_{b,\\text{mix}})  P_{\\text{ext}}\n$$\nimplies\n$$\nP_{1}^{*}(T_{b,\\text{mix}})  P_{1}^{*}(T_{b}^{(1)}).\n$$\nSince $P_{1}^{*}(T)$ is a strictly increasing function of $T$, it follows that\n$$\nT_{b,\\text{mix}}  T_{b}^{(1)}.\n$$\nThus, in the presence of a volatile solute like ethanol, the total vapor pressure can reach $P_{\\text{ext}}$ at a temperature below the normal boiling point of pure water, so the mixture can boil below the boiling point of pure water. The elevation formula $\\Delta T_{b} = i K_{b} m$ does not apply because its derivation neglects the solute’s vapor pressure by assuming a non-volatile solute.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental explanation is that the formula’s derivation assumes a non-volatile solute, whereas ethanol is volatile and contributes to the vapor pressure. This corresponds to option C. The other options are inconsistent: ethanol does not dissociate (A is false), non-ideality is not required to explain the observed lowering since the effect already arises for ideal volatile mixtures (B is not the fundamental reason), $K_{b}$ is not restricted to ionic solutes (D is false), and the enthalpy of mixing does not determine the equilibrium boiling point (E is irrelevant to the discrepancy).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1984368"}]}
