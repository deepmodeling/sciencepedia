This discrepancy is due to ion pairing, an equilibrium process itself. This conceptual problem [@problem_id:2026483] invites you to think like a physical chemist, using Le Chatelier's principle to predict how an external stress—in this case, immense pressure—affects the ion dissociation equilibrium. By understanding the volume change associated with dissociation, you can deduce the direction of the shift and its ultimate effect on the experimental van 't Hoff factor.", "problem": "In aqueous solutions, electrolytes may not dissociate completely due to the formation of ion pairs. Consider a moderately concentrated solution of magnesium sulfate, $\\text{MgSO}_4$. The dissolved salt exists in a dynamic equilibrium between solvated ion pairs, denoted as $\\text{MgSO}_4(\\text{aq})$, and the free solvated ions, $\\text{Mg}^{2+}(\\text{aq})$ and $\\text{SO}_4^{2-}(\\text{aq})$.

Due to the strong ordering effect that free ions impose on surrounding water molecules (a phenomenon known as electrostriction), the volume occupied by the solvated free ions is less than the volume occupied by the solvated ion pair. Consequently, the forward reaction (dissociation) proceeds with a net decrease in the total volume of the solution.\n\nIf this solution, initially at standard atmospheric pressure, is subjected to a significant increase in external pressure (e.g., to several hundred atmospheres) while maintaining a constant temperature, how will the experimental van 't Hoff factor, $i$, for the magnesium sulfate solution be affected?\n\nA. It will increase.\n\nB. It will decrease.\n\nC. It will remain essentially unchanged.\n\nD. It cannot be determined from the information provided.", "solution": "The problem asks for the effect of a large increase in external pressure on the experimental van 't Hoff factor, $i$, of a magnesium sulfate solution. To solve this, we must connect the van 't Hoff factor to the dissociation equilibrium and then apply Le Chatelier's principle to the effect of pressure.\n\nFirst, let's define the van 't Hoff factor, $i$. It is the ratio of the total moles of solute particles in solution to the moles of solute formula units dissolved. For an electrolyte that dissociates, $i$ depends on the degree of dissociation, $\\alpha$. The degree of dissociation represents the fraction of the initial solute that has separated into ions.\n\nThe equilibrium in question is:\n$$ \\text{MgSO}_4(\\text{aq}) \\rightleftharpoons \\text{Mg}^{2+}(\\text{aq}) + \\text{SO}_4^{2-}(\\text{aq}) $$\n\nLet's start with $n$ initial moles of MgSO₄. At equilibrium, a fraction $\\alpha$ will have dissociated.\n- Moles of MgSO₄(aq) ion pairs remaining = $n(1 - \\alpha)$\n- Moles of Mg²⁺(aq) ions formed = $n\\alpha$\n- Moles of SO₄²⁻(aq) ions formed = $n\\alpha$\n\nThe total number of moles of particles in the solution is the sum of these amounts:\n$$ n_{\\text{total}} = n(1 - \\alpha) + n\\alpha + n\\alpha = n(1 - \\alpha + \\alpha + \\alpha) = n(1 + \\alpha) $$\n\nBy definition, the van 't Hoff factor is:\n$$ i = \\frac{n_{\\text{total}}}{n} = \\frac{n(1 + \\alpha)}{n} = 1 + \\alpha $$\nThis equation shows that the van 't Hoff factor is directly related to the degree of dissociation, $\\alpha$. Any change in $\\alpha$ will cause a corresponding change in $i$.\n\nNext, we consider the effect of pressure on the equilibrium. Le Chatelier's principle states that if a change of condition (like pressure) is applied to a system in equilibrium, the system will shift in a direction that counteracts the change. For changes in pressure, the system will shift to favor the side with the smaller total volume to oppose the increase in pressure.\n\nThe problem statement explicitly provides the crucial piece of information: the forward reaction (dissociation) proceeds with a net decrease in the total volume of the solution. This means that the volume of the products (one mole of $\\text{Mg}^{2+}(\\text{aq})$ and one mole of $\\text{SO}_4^{2-}(\\text{aq})$) is less than the volume of the reactant (one mole of $\\text{MgSO}_4(\\text{aq})$).\n$$ V_{\\text{products}}  V_{\\text{reactants}} $$\nTherefore, the volume change of the reaction, $\\Delta V_{\\text{rxn}} = V_{\\text{products}} - V_{\\text{reactants}}$, is negative.\n\nWhen the external pressure on the solution is significantly increased, according to Le Chatelier's principle, the equilibrium will shift to the right (the forward direction), as this is the direction that leads to a smaller volume, thereby partially relieving the applied pressure.\n\nShifting the equilibrium to the right means that more $\\text{MgSO}_4(\\text{aq})$ ion pairs will dissociate into $\\text{Mg}^{2+}(\\text{aq})$ and $\\text{SO}_4^{2-}(\\text{aq})$ ions. This corresponds to an increase in the degree of dissociation, $\\alpha$.\n\nSince we established that $i = 1 + \\alpha$, an increase in $\\alpha$ will directly cause an increase in the value of the van 't Hoff factor, $i$.\n\nTherefore, subjecting the magnesium sulfate solution to a significant increase in external pressure will cause its experimental van 't Hoff factor to increase.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2026483"}, {"introduction": "The van 't Hoff factor is more than just a correction factor; it's a powerful analytical tool.
