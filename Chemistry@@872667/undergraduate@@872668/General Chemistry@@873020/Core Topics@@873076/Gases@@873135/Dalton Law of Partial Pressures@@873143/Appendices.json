{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding Dalton's Law begins with its foundational principle: the total pressure of a gas mixture is the simple sum of the partial pressures exerted by each individual component. This exercise provides a clear, practical scenario where a component's partial pressure is revealed by its absence, reinforcing the concept that each gas in a mixture behaves as if it were alone in the container. By observing the pressure drop after a chemical reaction consumes one gas, you can directly determine its initial contribution to the total pressure [@problem_id:1976767].", "problem": "A materials science laboratory is testing the oxidation resistance of a new metallic alloy. A sealed, rigid reaction chamber with a fixed volume is filled with a mixture of dry oxygen ($O_2$) and nitrogen ($N_2$) gas, which can be treated as ideal gases. The chamber is kept at a constant temperature throughout the experiment. Initially, the total pressure of the gas mixture inside the chamber is measured to be 805 kPa. A sample of the alloy is then heated inside the chamber, causing it to react completely with all the available oxygen to form a solid metal oxide. The nitrogen gas is inert and does not participate in the reaction. After the reaction is complete and the system has returned to its initial temperature, the pressure of the remaining gas in the chamber is measured to be 636 kPa.\n\nAssuming the volume occupied by the solid alloy and the resulting oxide layer is negligible compared to the chamber volume, determine the initial partial pressure of oxygen ($O_2$) in the chamber. Express your answer in kPa, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let the chamber volume be $V$ and the (constant) temperature be $T$. Treating the gases as ideal, each component satisfies the ideal gas law $P V = n R T$, where $P$ is its partial pressure and $n$ the number of moles.\n\nDenote initial moles by $n_{O_{2},0}$ and $n_{N_{2},0}$, with initial total pressure $P_{0}=805$ kPa. Thus the initial partial pressures are:\n$$\nP_{O_{2},0}=\\frac{n_{O_{2},0} R T}{V}, \\quad P_{N_{2},0}=\\frac{n_{N_{2},0} R T}{V}, \\quad P_{0}=P_{O_{2},0}+P_{N_{2},0}.\n$$\n\nThe alloy consumes all $O_{2}$ to form a solid; nitrogen is inert. The volume occupied by the solid is negligible, so the gas occupies the same $V$ before and after, and the system returns to the same $T$. Therefore, after reaction, the only gas remaining is $N_{2}$ with moles $n_{N_{2},f}=n_{N_{2},0}$. The final gas pressure is then\n$$\nP_{f}=\\frac{n_{N_{2},f} R T}{V}=\\frac{n_{N_{2},0} R T}{V}=P_{N_{2},0}.\n$$\n\nGiven $P_{f}=636$ kPa, it follows that the initial partial pressure of nitrogen is $P_{N_{2},0}=636$ kPa. Hence the initial partial pressure of oxygen is\n$$\nP_{O_{2},0}=P_{0}-P_{N_{2},0}=805-636=169 \\text{ kPa}.\n$$\n\nRounded to three significant figures, this is $169$ kPa.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{169}$$", "id": "1976767"}, {"introduction": "Partial pressures are not just static fractions of a total; they are dynamic properties of each gas component that respond to changes in the system's conditions. This practice takes us to the surface of Mars to explore how the partial pressure of a gas within a collected sample changes when it is moved to a new environment with a different volume and temperature.
