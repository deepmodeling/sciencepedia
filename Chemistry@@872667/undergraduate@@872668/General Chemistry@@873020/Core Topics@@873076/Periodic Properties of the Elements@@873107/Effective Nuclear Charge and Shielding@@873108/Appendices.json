A common initial simplification is to assume that core electrons perfectly shield the valence electrons, but this leads to incorrect predictions. This final conceptual practice [@problem_id:1990873] challenges that simple picture, pushing you to identify the primary reason why shielding by inner electrons is incomplete. Understanding this flaw is key to appreciating the quantum mechanical nature of atoms, particularly the concept of orbital penetration.", "problem": "An undergraduate chemistry student is studying the concept of effective nuclear charge ($Z_{\\text{eff}}$) using the potassium atom (K, atomic number $Z = 19$) as a model. The ground-state electron configuration of potassium is $[\\text{Ar}]4s^1$. The student puts forward the following argument:\n\n\"The single valence electron is in the $4s$ orbital. The remaining 18 electrons, which constitute the argon-like core ($1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6$), are all in shells closer to the nucleus than the $n=4$ shell. Therefore, these 18 core electrons should act as a perfect, complete shield. The shielding constant, $S$, should be exactly 18. Consequently, the effective nuclear charge experienced by the $4s$ electron should be $Z_{\\text{eff}} = Z - S = 19 - 18 = +1$.\"\n\nWhile simple, this model is known to be incorrect, as the experimentally determined first ionization energy of potassium suggests a $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ value significantly greater than +1. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate and primary explanation for the flaw in the student's reasoning?\n\nA. The student's model neglects the electron-electron repulsion between the core electrons themselves, which causes the core to expand and become a less effective shield.\n\nB. The student's model incorrectly assumes electrons are in rigid, non-overlapping shells. In reality, the radial probability distribution of the $4s$ orbital allows it to penetrate the inner electron shells, causing it to be incompletely shielded.\n\nC. For atoms with more than 18 electrons, relativistic effects become significant, causing the $1s$ orbital to contract. This contraction pulls the other orbitals closer to the nucleus, universally increasing the effective nuclear charge on the valence electron.\n\nD. The shielding effect is not linear. Each additional core electron provides progressively less shielding, so the total shielding constant $S$ is always less than half the number of core electrons.\n\nE. The student's model is fundamentally inverted; core electrons do not shield the nuclear charge but rather focus it. This effect, known as nuclear lensing, means the effective charge is always greater than the true nuclear charge $Z$.", "solution": "Define the effective nuclear charge by the mean-field relation\n$$\nZ_{\\text{eff}}=Z-S,\n$$\nwhere $S$ is the shielding constant summarizing how much of the nuclear charge is screened by other electrons on average.\n\nThe student’s argument sets $S=18$ by assuming a perfect, complete shield from the $1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6$ core. This rests on an implicit classical picture of rigid, non-overlapping shells: the $4s$ electron is presumed to reside entirely outside the core, so it would always experience the full negative charge of all $18$ core electrons between it and the nucleus.\n\nQuantum mechanically, this picture is incorrect because electrons occupy orbitals with radial probability distributions, not fixed shells. The radial probability density for an $ns$ orbital is\n$$\nP_{ns}(r)=r^2 |R_{ns}(r)|^2,\n$$\nand for $s$ states ($l=0$), $R_{ns}(r)$ is finite at $r=0$ and has significant amplitude at small $r$. Thus, the $4s$ electron penetrates into regions of space where core electrons are also present. Whenever the $4s$ electron is found at a radius $r$ inside some portion of the core electron density, only the core charge at radii less than $r$ can screen the nucleus at that instant; electron density at radii larger than $r$ does not shield. Consequently, the instantaneous shielding is less than complete whenever penetration occurs, and the average shielding $S$ over the $4s$ radial distribution satisfies $S18$, leading to $Z_{\\text{eff}}>1$.\n\nThis penetration effect is precisely what is captured by empirical rules such as Slater’s rules, which assign less-than-complete screening contributions to electrons in shells with $n-1$ relative to the valence $ns$ electron. The root cause is the non-rigid, overlapping, radially penetrating nature of the $4s$ orbital, not core-core repulsion or relativistic contraction.\n\nTherefore:\n- Option A is not the primary flaw; core-core repulsion and any consequent expansion are secondary, and even a non-expanded core would not perfectly shield an $s$ electron due to penetration.\n- Option C invokes relativistic effects that are not dominant for $Z$ of this magnitude and does not address the main quantum-mechanical cause of incomplete shielding.\n- Option D asserts an incorrect universal quantitative rule; while shielding is not simply additive, the primary reason here is penetration, not a blanket “less than half” rule.\n- Option E is physically incorrect; core electrons do not focus the nuclear charge to exceed $Z$.\n\nThe most accurate and primary explanation is that the student incorrectly assumed rigid, non-overlapping shells; the $4s$ electron penetrates the core and is incompletely shielded.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1990873"}]}
