This first practice focuses on beryllium ($Be$) and nitrogen ($N$), two elements whose electron affinities deviate significantly from the expected trend. By analyzing their unique electron configurations, you will explore how the enhanced stability of filled and half-filled subshells makes the addition of an electron energetically unfavorable, a core concept in predicting chemical reactivity. [@problem_id:2278736]", "problem": "Electron affinity ($E_{ea}$) is defined as the energy change that occurs when an electron is added to a neutral atom in the gaseous state to form a negative ion. A convention is that a more negative $E_{ea}$ indicates a more favorable process (more energy is released). The general periodic trend is for electron affinity to become more negative (more exothermic) moving from left to right across a period. However, there are notable exceptions. For the first 20 elements, Beryllium (Be, atomic number 4) and Nitrogen (N, atomic number 7) have electron affinity values that are positive or close to zero, indicating that the formation of their respective negative ions, $\\text{Be}^{-}$ and $\\text{N}^{-}$, is energetically unfavorable.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and complete explanation for the anomalously low electron affinities of both Beryllium and Nitrogen?\n\nA. Both Beryllium and Nitrogen have very high electronegativity compared to other elements in their respective periods, which paradoxically repels an incoming electron.\nB. The atomic radii of both Beryllium and Nitrogen are unusually large, causing the incoming electron to experience a very weak effective nuclear charge.\nC. Beryllium has a completely filled $2s$ subshell, and Nitrogen has a half-filled $2p$ subshell. In both cases, the incoming electron must enter a new subshell or pair up in an already occupied orbital, which is energetically unfavorable due to electronic stability and electron-electron repulsion.\nD. Both Beryllium and Nitrogen have exceptionally high first ionization energies. Since it is difficult to remove an electron, it is also difficult to add one, making the electron affinity unfavorable.\nE. The low electron affinity of Beryllium is due to its metallic character, while the low electron affinity of Nitrogen is due to it being a diatomic gas, $\\text{N}_2$, under standard conditions.", "solution": "Define the sign convention for electron affinity as the energy change for the process $A(g)+e^{-}\\to A^{-}(g)$, with $E_{ea}0$ indicating an exothermic (favorable) process under the convention given. Across a period, $E_{ea}$ generally becomes more negative due to increasing effective nuclear charge, but subshell structure and electron-electron interactions can produce exceptions.\n\nFor Beryllium, the ground-state electron configuration is $1s^{2}2s^{2}$. This has a closed $2s$ subshell, which is electronically stable. An incoming electron cannot enter the already filled $2s$ subshell and must occupy a $2p$ orbital, which lies higher in energy than $2s$, i.e., $E(2p)E(2s)$, due to reduced penetration and greater shielding. Thus, the neutral Be atom enjoys closed-subshell stability, while formation of $\\text{Be}^{-}$ requires population of a new, higher-energy subshell. The gain in electron-nucleus attraction upon adding the electron to a $2p$ orbital is offset by the energetic cost associated with occupying this higher subshell and the loss of closed-subshell stability, making $E_{ea}$ small in magnitude and often positive (unfavorable) under the stated convention.\n\nFor Nitrogen, the ground-state configuration is $1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{3}$, which is a half-filled $2p$ subshell. By Hund’s rule, this maximizes spin multiplicity and exchange stabilization, lowering the energy of the neutral atom. Adding an electron produces $2p^{4}$, which forces pairing in one of the $2p$ orbitals. This introduces additional interelectronic repulsion (pairing energy) and reduces exchange stabilization, both of which raise the energy of the anion relative to the neutral atom. Consequently, the energy released upon electron addition is small or insufficient to overcome these penalties, yielding an $E_{ea}$ that is near zero or positive under the given sign convention.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A is incorrect because electronegativity reflects an atom’s tendency to attract electrons in bonds and does not cause a “repulsion” of an incoming electron; moreover, Be does not have high electronegativity. This does not address subshell stability or pairing.\n- B is incorrect because Be and N do not have unusually large atomic radii within Period 2; the anomaly arises from subshell filling and electron-electron interactions, not an anomalously weak effective nuclear charge.\n- C is correct: Be has a filled $2s$ subshell, so the added electron must enter a higher-energy $2p$ subshell; N has a half-filled $2p$ subshell, so the added electron must pair in an already occupied orbital. In both cases, electronic stability (closed or half-filled subshells) and electron-electron repulsion make the process energetically unfavorable.\n- D is incorrect: first ionization energy and electron affinity are distinct properties; a high ionization energy does not imply a low (unfavorable) electron affinity. The anomalies are specifically due to subshell filling and pairing effects.\n- E is incorrect: electron affinity is an atomic property; invoking the diatomic nature of $\\text{N}_{2}$ in the standard state is irrelevant. Likewise, “metallic character” alone does not explain Be’s anomaly; the correct rationale is the filled $2s$ subshell and resulting subshell-occupation requirement for the added electron.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and complete explanation is the subshell stability and pairing argument given in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2278736"}, {"introduction": "Having established that subshell stability creates exceptions to the electron affinity trend, we now delve into a more nuanced question: are all exceptions created equal? This practice compares the drop in electron affinity from Group 1 to Group 2 with the drop from Group 14 to Group 15.

A more negative EA value indicates a more exothermic and thus more favorable process. While EA generally becomes more negative (more exothermic) across a period from left to right, there are significant deviations from this trend. Two notable anomalies occur when moving from a Group 1 element to a Group 2 element, and when moving from a Group 14 element to a Group 15 element. In both cases, the electron affinity becomes substantially less negative and often positive (endothermic).\n\nHowever, the magnitude of this deviation is not the same for both transitions. The \"drop\" in electron affinity (i.e., the shift towards a more positive energy value) is typically much more pronounced for the Group 1 $\\to$ Group 2 transition than for the Group 14 $\\to$ Group 15 transition within the same period.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate physical reasoning for this difference in the magnitude of the EA drop?\n\nA. The Group 1 $\\to$ Group 2 drop is larger because the incoming electron must occupy a new, higher-energy p-subshell. For the Group 14 $\\to$ Group 15 transition, the electron enters the existing p-subshell, with the smaller energy penalty arising from electron-electron repulsion due to orbital pairing.

This superior stability in Group 15 elements creates a larger energy barrier to adding an electron compared to the barrier for Group 2 elements.\n\nC. Both drops are of similar magnitude and are primarily caused by the fact that the added electron is shielded more effectively in Group 2 and Group 15 anions. The specific subshell configurations are only a minor contributing factor to the overall energy change.\n\nD. The Group 1 $\\to$ Group 2 drop is large due to the high electron-electron repulsion from pairing two electrons in the s-orbital. The Group 14 $\\to$ Group 15 drop is large because the electron must enter a new, much higher energy d-subshell.\n\nE. The drops are different because the increase in effective nuclear charge ($Z_{\\text{eff}}$) is much smaller for the Group 1 $\\to$ Group 2 step than for the Group 14 $\\to$ Group 15 step, making it easier for the electron configuration effect to dominate in the former case.", "solution": "The question asks why the drop in electron affinity (EA) is larger when moving from Group 1 to Group 2 than from Group 14 to Group 15. This \"drop\" refers to the fact that EA becomes much less exothermic (often endothermic) at these transitions. The reason for the drop in each case is an energetic penalty for adding an electron, which we must compare.\n\n1.  **Group 2 Electron Affinity:** A Group 2 element (e.g., Be) has an electron configuration of $ns^2$. This is a stable, filled subshell. To add an electron, it must be placed in the next available orbital, which is in the higher-energy $np$ subshell. The energy cost to populate a new, higher-energy subshell is substantial. This large energetic penalty is why Group 2 elements have endothermic or near-zero EAs.\n\n2.  **Group 15 Electron Affinity:** A Group 15 element (e.g., N) has an electron configuration of $ns^2np^3$. This is a stable, half-filled subshell, which benefits from maximized exchange energy. To add an electron, it must be placed into a $p$-orbital that is already occupied by another electron. This has two energetic costs: (a) loss of the special stability of the half-filled subshell, and (b) introduction of electron-electron repulsion, or \"pairing energy,\" between the two electrons in the same orbital.\n\n**Comparison:** The key is to compare the magnitude of the energetic penalties.\n- The penalty for Group 2 is the energy difference between the $ns$ and $np$ subshells, $\\Delta E_{\\text{subshell}}(s\\to p)$.\n- The penalty for Group 15 is primarily the pairing energy within the $p$ subshell, $\\Delta E_{\\text{pair}}(p)$, plus loss of exchange energy.\n\nGenerally, the energy required to access an entirely new subshell (with a different angular momentum quantum number, like going from $s$ to $p$) is significantly greater than the energy required to pair electrons within an existing subshell.\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\text{subshell}}(s\\to p) \\gg \\Delta E_{\\text{pair}}(p)\n$$\nTherefore, the energetic barrier to adding an electron to a Group 2 element is much larger than for a Group 15 element. This results in a more pronounced \"drop\" in electron affinity for the Group 1 $\\to$ Group 2 transition.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is correct. It accurately identifies that for the G1$\\to$G2 drop, the issue is adding an electron to a G2 atom, which requires starting a new p-subshell (a large penalty). For the G14$\\to$G15 drop, the issue is adding an electron to a G15 atom, which requires pairing in the existing p-subshell (a smaller penalty). It correctly states that the subshell-access cost is greater than the pairing energy cost.\n- B is incorrect. It claims the G14$\\to$G15 drop is larger, which is typically not true, and incorrectly compares the stabilities.\n- C is incorrect. The drops are not of similar magnitude, and the subshell configurations are the primary cause, not a minor factor.\n- D is incorrect. For G14$\\to$G15, the electron does not enter a d-subshell. The key penalty for G2 is not pairing, but starting a new subshell.\n- E is incorrect. While $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ changes, the dominant factor explaining the *difference* in the drops is the qualitative difference between starting a new subshell versus pairing electrons in an existing one.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate physical reasoning is provided by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2010495"}, {"introduction": "This final practice extends the concept of electron affinity from individual atoms to molecular species, introducing the cutting-edge topic of \"superhalogens.\" You will apply your knowledge of electronegativity and stability to design neutral molecules with electron affinities even greater than that of any single atom.

[@problem_id:2278748]", "problem": "The electron affinity (EA) of an atom or molecule is the energy released when an electron is added to the species in the gas phase. A special class of molecules, sometimes referred to as \"superhalogens,\" exhibits an electron affinity that exceeds that of any halogen atom. The highest electron affinity among all atoms belongs to chlorine, with a value of 3.61 eV.\n\nThe remarkably high electron affinity of certain neutral polyatomic radicals, which can be represented by the general formula $MX_k$, is primarily attributed to a potent charge stabilization mechanism. When the radical $MX_k$ accepts an electron to form the anion $MX_k^-$, the additional negative charge is no longer localized on a single atom. Instead, it becomes delocalized over the multiple, highly electronegative peripheral atoms ($X$). This delocalization effect is most pronounced when the central atom ($M$) is significantly less electronegative than the peripheral atoms ($X$), as this facilitates the migration of the excess charge to the molecular periphery.\n\nBased on this principle of charge delocalization and the electronegativity differences between the constituent atoms, evaluate the following list of neutral, main-group radicals. Select all species that you would reasonably predict to be superhalogens (i.e., have an electron affinity greater than 3.61 eV).\n\nA. $CH_3$\nB. $NF_2$\nC. $PF_4$\nD. $AlF_4$\nE. $SF_5$", "solution": "We are asked to predict which neutral radicals of the form $MX_{k}$ are likely to be superhalogens, i.e., have $EA(MX_{k})EA(\\mathrm{Cl})$ with $EA(\\mathrm{Cl})=3.61 \\,\\mathrm{eV}$.

The stabilization is enhanced when:\n- The number of electronegative ligands is large ($k$ large), promoting delocalization of charge approximately over $k$ sites.\n- The electronegativity contrast $\\Delta \\chi=\\chi_{X}-\\chi_{M}$ is large and positive, so that excess negative charge is driven to the periphery ($X$) rather than remaining on the center ($M$).\n\nThus, the qualitative criteria for superhalogen behavior are: $X$ should be very electronegative (typically $X=\\mathrm{F}$), $M$ should be significantly less electronegative than $X$ (large positive $\\Delta \\chi$), and $k$ should be sufficiently large.\n\nWe apply these criteria to each option:\n\nA. $CH_{3}$: Here $X=\\mathrm{H}$ is not highly electronegative and $\\chi_{C}\\gtrsim \\chi_{H}$, so $\\Delta \\chi$ is small or negative.
