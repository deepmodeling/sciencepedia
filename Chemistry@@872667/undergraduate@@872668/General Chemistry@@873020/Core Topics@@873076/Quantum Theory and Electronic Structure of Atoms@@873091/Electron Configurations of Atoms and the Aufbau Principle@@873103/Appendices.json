Based on these principles, determine how many electrons in this atom occupy an orbital by themselves.\n\nChoose the correct option from the following:\nA. 0\nB. 2\nC. 4\nD. 6", "solution": "The problem asks for the number of unpaired electrons in a neutral atom with the valence electron configuration $3s^2 3p^4$. To determine this, we must visualize the arrangement of these electrons in their respective atomic orbitals.\n\nFirst, we analyze the $3s^2$ part of the configuration. The $s$ subshell consists of a single orbital. The superscript '2' indicates that this $3s$ orbital contains two electrons. According to the Pauli exclusion principle, any two electrons occupying the same orbital must have opposite spins. Therefore, the two electrons in the $3s$ orbital are paired. We can represent this as an orbital diagram:\n$$\n3s: \\underline{\\uparrow\\downarrow}\n$$\nThis part of the configuration contributes zero unpaired electrons.\n\nNext, we analyze the $3p^4$ part of the configuration. The $p$ subshell consists of three degenerate (equal-energy) orbitals. We must distribute four electrons among these three orbitals. This distribution is governed by Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity, which states that electrons will fill degenerate orbitals singly first with parallel spins, before any orbital is doubly occupied.\n\nLet's place the four electrons into the three $p$ orbitals step-by-step:\n1. The first electron goes into the first $p$ orbital: $$ \\underline{\\uparrow\\phantom{\\downarrow}} \\quad \\underline{\\phantom{\\uparrow\\downarrow}} \\quad \\underline{\\phantom{\\uparrow\\downarrow}} $$\n2. The second electron goes into the second $p$ orbital with the same spin: $$ \\underline{\\uparrow\\phantom{\\downarrow}} \\quad \\underline{\\uparrow\\phantom{\\downarrow}} \\quad \\underline{\\phantom{\\uparrow\\downarrow}} $$\n3. The third electron goes into the third $p$ orbital with the same spin: $$ \\underline{\\uparrow\\phantom{\\downarrow}} \\quad \\underline{\\uparrow\\phantom{\\downarrow}} \\quad \\underline{\\uparrow\\phantom{\\downarrow}} $$\n\nAt this stage, each of the three $p$ orbitals is singly occupied, and we have used three of the four electrons. All three are unpaired.\n\n4. The fourth and final electron must now pair up with one of the electrons already in an orbital. It will enter the first $p$ orbital, but with an opposite spin, as required by the Pauli exclusion principle: $$ \\underline{\\uparrow\\downarrow} \\quad \\underline{\\uparrow\\phantom{\\downarrow}} \\quad \\underline{\\uparrow\\phantom{\\downarrow}} $$\n\nNow, we can examine the final configuration of the $3p$ subshell. One of the $p$ orbitals is completely filled with a pair of electrons. The other two $p$ orbitals are singly occupied. An electron that occupies an orbital by itself is, by definition, an unpaired electron.\n\nCounting the unpaired electrons, we find there is one in the second $p$ orbital and one in the third $p$ orbital. Therefore, there are a total of two unpaired electrons.\n\nCombining the results for both the $3s$ and $3p$ subshells, the total number of unpaired electrons for the valence configuration $3s^2 3p^4$ is $0 + 2 = 2$.\n\nComparing this result with the given choices:\nA. 0 is incorrect. This would violate Hund's rule.\nB. 2 is the correct answer.\nC. 4 is incorrect. This would imply that each of the four $p$ electrons occupies a separate orbital, which is impossible as a $p$ subshell only has three orbitals.\nD. 6 is incorrect. This is the total number of valence electrons, not the number of unpaired electrons.\n\nThus, the correct option is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1991527"}, {"introduction": "The Aufbau principle provides a reliable roadmap for most elements, but the chemistry of transition metals introduces important exceptions and rules for ion formation.

The species are isoelectronic, but V has the configuration $[Ar] 3d^5$ while $Cr^{+}$ has the configuration $[Ar] 3d^3 4s^2$.", "solution": "We determine whether the species are isoelectronic by comparing electron counts. A neutral vanadium atom with atomic number $Z=23$ has $23$ electrons. A singly charged chromium cation has one fewer electron than neutral chromium; since chromium has $Z=24$, $Cr^{+}$ has $24-1=23$ electrons. Therefore, both species have $23$ electrons and are isoelectronic by definition (isoelectronic species have the same number of electrons).\n\nNext, we determine their ground-state electron configurations using the aufbau principle, Hund’s rule, and known exceptions for transition metals, along with the rule for ion formation that, for transition metal cations, the $ns$ electrons are removed before the $(n-1)d$ electrons.\n\nFor neutral vanadium ($Z=23$), the ground-state configuration follows the expected filling pattern:\n$$\n\\text{V (neutral)}:\\quad [\\text{Ar}]\\,3d^{3}4s^{2}\n$$\n\nFor neutral chromium ($Z=24$), the ground state is the well-known exception that favors a half-filled $3d$ subshell:\n$$\n\\text{Cr (neutral)}:\\quad [\\text{Ar}]\\,3d^{5}4s^{1}\n$$\nForming $Cr^{+}$ removes the highest principal quantum number electron first (the $4s$ electron), yielding:\n$$\n\\text{Cr}^{+}:\\quad [\\text{Ar}]\\,3d^{5}\n$$\n\nComparing, V (neutral) is $[\\text{Ar}]\\,3d^{3}4s^{2}$, while $Cr^{+}$ is $[\\text{Ar}]\\,3d^{5}$.

It represents the net positive charge experienced by an electron in a polyelectronic atom, which is less than the full nuclear charge ($Z$) due to the shielding effect of other electrons. The relationship is given by $Z_{eff} = Z - \\sigma$, where $\\sigma$ is the shielding constant.\n\nA simplified but powerful method for estimating $\\sigma$ is provided by Slater's rules. For a neutral vanadium atom (V), with atomic number $Z=23$, you are to calculate the effective nuclear charge for two different electrons and use this information to determine which type of electron is removed first upon ionization to form the $\\text{V}^{+}$ ion.\n\nTo calculate the shielding constant, $\\sigma$, for a specific electron, apply the following set of rules:\n1.  Write the electron configuration of the atom and group the orbitals as follows: $(1s)$, $(2s, 2p)$, $(3s, 3p)$, $(3d)$, $(4s, 4p)$, $(4d)$, $(4f)$, etc.\n2.  Electrons in groups to the right of the group containing the electron of interest do not contribute to shielding ($\\sigma = 0$ from these electrons).\n3.  For an electron in an **$ns$ or $np$** orbital:\n    *   Each other electron in the same $(ns, np)$ group contributes $0.35$ to $\\sigma$.\n    *   Each electron in the $(n-1)$ shell contributes $0.85$ to $\\sigma$.\n    *   Each electron in shells $(n-2)$ or lower contributes $1.00$ to $\\sigma$.\n4.  For an electron in an **$nd$ or $nf$** orbital:\n    *   Each other electron in the same $(nd, nf)$ group contributes $0.35$ to $\\sigma$.\n    *   Each electron in all groups to the left contributes $1.00$ to $\\sigma$.\n\nBased on these rules, calculate the effective nuclear charges for a $4s$ electron and a $3d$ electron in a neutral vanadium atom.
