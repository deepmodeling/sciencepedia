In our universe, the rules governing these numbers are as follows:\n1.  The principal quantum number, $n$, can be any positive integer ($1, 2, 3, \\dots$).\n2.  For a given $n$, the angular momentum quantum number, $l$, can be any integer from $0$ to $n-1$.\n3.  For a given $l$, the magnetic quantum number, $m_l$, can be any integer from $-l$ to $+l$.\n4.  The spin quantum number, $m_s$, can be either $+1/2$ or $-1/2$.\nEach unique combination of ($n, l, m_l$) defines an atomic orbital, which can hold a maximum of two electrons (one for each spin value).\n\nNow, imagine a hypothetical universe with slightly altered physical laws. In this universe, the rules for $n$, $m_l$, and $m_s$ remain identical to ours. However, the rule for the angular momentum quantum number is different: for a given principal quantum number $n$, the quantum number $l$ can only take on **even** integer values from $0$ up to (and including) $n-1$.\n\nBased on these modified rules, calculate the maximum number of electrons that can populate the principal energy level where $n=5$ in an atom from this hypothetical universe.", "solution": "In this hypothetical universe, for a given principal quantum number $n$, the allowed $l$ values are the even integers from $0$ up to $n-1$.
