This advanced exercise delves into this nuance, tasking you with applying a quantitative model known as Slater's rules. By estimating the effective nuclear charge ($Z_{eff}$) experienced by $d$-electrons in an early transition metal (Vanadium) versus a late one (Zinc), you will numerically demonstrate why $d$-electrons become progressively more \"core-like\" and stable across a period, explaining the rich and varied chemistry of these essential elements.
