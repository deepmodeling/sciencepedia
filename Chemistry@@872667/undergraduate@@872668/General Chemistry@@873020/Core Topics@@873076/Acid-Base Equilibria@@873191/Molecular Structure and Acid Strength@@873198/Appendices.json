This exercise underscores that not all hydrogen atoms in a molecular formula are necessarily acidic. Drawing the correct Lewis structure is the essential first step in determining a molecule's proticity, as the location of a proton dictates its chemical behavior [@problem_id:2007036].", "problem": "The concept of proticity refers to the number of acidic protons (hydrogen ions, $H^+$) that a molecule of an acid can donate in a reaction. For oxyacids, the acidity of a hydrogen atom is critically dependent on which atom it is covalently bonded to. Consider two common oxyacids of phosphorus: phosphoric acid ($H_3PO_4$) and phosphorous acid ($H_3PO_3$). Experimentally, it is found that phosphoric acid is a triprotic acid, meaning it can donate all three of its hydrogen atoms as protons. In contrast, phosphorous acid is only a diprotic acid, capable of donating just two of its three hydrogen atoms.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for this observed difference in proticity?\n\nA. The oxidation state of phosphorus in $H_3PO_4$ is +5, allowing it to support three acidic protons, while the oxidation state of phosphorus in $H_3PO_3$ is +3, which can only support two.\n\nB. In the most stable Lewis structure for $H_3PO_3$, one hydrogen atom is directly bonded to the central phosphorus atom, making it non-acidic. In contrast, all three hydrogen atoms in $H_3PO_4$ are bonded to oxygen atoms, making them all acidic.\n\nC. Phosphorous acid has one fewer oxygen atom than phosphoric acid, which reduces the overall electron-withdrawing effect on the hydrogen atoms, thereby preventing the third proton from being donated.\n\nD. The conjugate base of phosphorous acid, after losing two protons ($HPO_3^{2-}$), is significantly more stable due to resonance than the conjugate base of phosphoric acid after losing three protons ($PO_4^{3-}$), thus disfavoring the loss of a third proton from phosphorous acid.\n\nE. The terminal oxygen atom (one not bonded to hydrogen) in phosphorous acid forms a single bond with phosphorus, resulting in a formal charge distribution that strongly holds onto all three hydrogen atoms, while in phosphoric acid, it forms a double bond.", "solution": "The problem asks for the fundamental reason why phosphoric acid ($H_3PO_4$) is triprotic while phosphorous acid ($H_3PO_3$) is diprotic. The key lies in understanding their molecular structures, which we can determine by drawing their most stable Lewis structures. In oxyacids, a hydrogen atom is considered acidic only if it is bonded to a highly electronegative atom, which in this case is oxygen. A hydrogen atom bonded directly to the less electronegative central atom (phosphorus) is not appreciably acidic.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Lewis Structure of Phosphoric Acid ($H_3PO_4$)**\n\n1.  **Count valence electrons:**\n    - Hydrogen (H): 3 atoms $\\times$ 1 valence electron/atom = 3\n    - Phosphorus (P): 1 atom $\\times$ 5 valence electrons/atom = 5\n    - Oxygen (O): 4 atoms $\\times$ 6 valence electrons/atom = 24\n    - Total valence electrons = $3 + 5 + 24 = 32$\n\n2.  **Determine the skeletal structure:** In oxyacids, hydrogen atoms are typically bonded to oxygen atoms, which are in turn bonded to the central atom. So, the skeleton will have a central phosphorus atom bonded to four oxygen atoms, and three of these oxygen atoms will each be bonded to a hydrogen atom.\n\n3.  **Draw the structure and distribute electrons:**\n    - The skeletal connections ($4 \\times$ P-O bonds and $3 \\times$ O-H bonds) use $7 \\times 2 = 14$ electrons.\n    - Remaining electrons: $32 - 14 = 18$.\n    - Distribute these 18 electrons as lone pairs on the oxygen atoms to satisfy their octets. The three oxygens in the O-H groups each need 2 lone pairs (4 electrons), for a total of $3 \\times 4 = 12$ electrons. The one terminal oxygen atom (not bonded to H) needs 3 lone pairs (6 electrons). Total lone pair electrons used: $12 + 6 = 18$.\n    - At this point, all atoms (except P) have a full octet. P has 4 single bonds, so it also has an octet.\n\n4.  **Check formal charges to find the most stable structure:**\n    - Formal Charge = (Valence Electrons) - (Lone Pair Electrons) - $\\frac{1}{2}$(Bonding Electrons)\n    - H atoms: $1 - 0 - \\frac{1}{2}(2) = 0$\n    - O atoms in P-O-H: $6 - 4 - \\frac{1}{2}(4) = 0$\n    - Terminal O atom: $6 - 6 - \\frac{1}{2}(2) = -1$\n    - P atom: $5 - 0 - \\frac{1}{2}(8) = +1$\n    - To minimize formal charges, we can form a double bond between the P and the terminal O. Phosphorus is in the 3rd period, so it can have an expanded octet. The new structure has a P=O double bond.\n    - New formal charges: P is $5 - 0 - \\frac{1}{2}(10) = 0$. The double-bonded O is $6 - 4 - \\frac{1}{2}(4) = 0$. All other atoms are also 0. This is the most stable and accepted Lewis structure for phosphoric acid.\n\n5.  **Conclusion for $H_3PO_4$:** In this structure, all three hydrogen atoms are bonded to oxygen atoms (forming hydroxyl, -OH, groups). Therefore, all three are acidic protons. Phosphoric acid is triprotic.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Lewis Structure of Phosphorous Acid ($H_3PO_3$)**\n\n1.  **Count valence electrons:**\n    - Hydrogen (H): 3 atoms $\\times$ 1 valence electron/atom = 3\n    - Phosphorus (P): 1 atom $\\times$ 5 valence electrons/atom = 5\n    - Oxygen (O): 3 atoms $\\times$ 6 valence electrons/atom = 18\n    - Total valence electrons = $3 + 5 + 18 = 26$\n\n2.  **Determine the skeletal structure:** This is the crucial part. While one might assume a structure with a central P bonded to three -OH groups, experimental evidence and stability considerations point to a different structure. The most stable structure for phosphorous acid has one hydrogen atom bonded directly to the central phosphorus atom. The other two hydrogens are bonded to oxygen atoms.\n    - The skeleton is a central P atom bonded to two -OH groups, one terminal O atom, and one H atom.\n\n3.  **Draw the structure and distribute electrons:**\n    - The skeletal connections (2 $\\times$ P-O bonds, 1 $\\times$ P-O, 1 $\\times$ P-H, and 2 $\\times$ O-H) as single bonds use $6 \\times 2 = 12$ electrons.\n    - Remaining electrons: $26 - 12 = 14$.\n    - Distribute these 14 electrons as lone pairs on the oxygens. The two oxygens in the -OH groups each need 2 lone pairs (4 electrons), for a total of $2 \\times 4 = 8$ electrons. The terminal oxygen atom needs 3 lone pairs (6 electrons). Total lone pair electrons used: $8 + 6 = 14$.\n\n4.  **Check formal charges:**\n    - With all single bonds: The two O atoms in the P-O-H groups have a formal charge of 0. The H atoms have a formal charge of 0. The terminal O atom has a formal charge of -1. The P atom has a formal charge of $+1$.\n    - Similar to phosphoric acid, we minimize formal charges by forming a P=O double bond with the terminal oxygen. This gives P an expanded octet.\n    - The resulting structure has a P=O double bond, two P-OH single bonds, and one P-H single bond. In this structure, all atoms have a formal charge of 0. This is the most stable Lewis structure.\n\n5.  **Conclusion for $H_3PO_3$:** In this correct, most stable structure, only two hydrogen atoms are bonded to oxygen atoms. The third hydrogen is bonded directly to the phosphorus atom. The electronegativity difference between O (3.44) and H (2.20) is large, making the O-H bond very polar and the proton acidic. The electronegativity difference between P (2.19) and H (2.20) is negligible, making the P-H bond essentially nonpolar and the attached hydrogen non-acidic. Thus, phosphorous acid has only two acidic protons and is diprotic.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the options**\n\n*   A is incorrect. While the oxidation states are indeed different, the oxidation state does not directly determine the number of acidic protons. The bonding arrangement is the direct cause.\n*   **B is correct.** It accurately describes the bonding in the most stable Lewis structures of both molecules and correctly links the type of bond (O-H vs. P-H) to acidity.\n*   C is incorrect. While the number of oxygen atoms is different, this statement misidentifies the consequence. The key is not a general electron-withdrawing effect, but the specific location of one hydrogen atom.\n*   D is incorrect. While resonance stabilization of the conjugate base is a factor in determining acid *strength* (pKa values), it does not determine the *number* of acidic protons (proticity). The fundamental structural reason comes first.\n*   E is incorrect. This statement incorrectly describes the bonding in phosphorous acid's most stable form, which has a P=O double bond, not a single bond.\n\nThe fundamental reason for the difference in proticity is the connectivity of the atoms.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2007036"}, {"introduction": "This practice moves from connectivity to the inherent electronic properties of atoms involved in a bond. It challenges you to compare the acid strengths of hydrides for elements within the same periodic group, revealing a crucial competition between electronegativity and factors like bond strength and the size of the resulting conjugate base.

A primary reason for the acidity difference is that the P-H bond is weaker and thus easier to break than the N-H bond.\n\nD. A primary reason for the acidity difference is that the greater electronegativity of nitrogen stabilizes the negative charge on the amide conjugate base ($NH_2^-$) more effectively than phosphorus stabilizes the charge on the phosphide conjugate base ($PH_2^-$).\n\nE. A primary reason for the acidity difference is that the larger atomic radius of phosphorus allows for better stabilization of the negative charge on the phosphide conjugate base ($PH_2^-$) compared to the amide ion ($NH_2^-$).", "solution": "We assess Brønsted-Lowry acidity via the equilibria in water\n$$\n\\mathrm{NH_{3}} + \\mathrm{H_{2}O} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{NH_{2}^{-}} + \\mathrm{H_{3}O^{+}}, \\quad K_{a,N},\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{PH_{3}} + \\mathrm{H_{2}O} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{PH_{2}^{-}} + \\mathrm{H_{3}O^{+}}, \\quad K_{a,P},\n$$\nwith the stronger acid having the larger $K_{a}$ (equivalently, smaller $pK_{a}$ where $pK_{a} = -\\log_{10}(K_{a})$). Two primary molecular factors control the relative magnitudes of $K_{a,N}$ and $K_{a,P}$: (i) the ease of heterolytic cleavage of the $E$–H bond ($E=\\mathrm{N}$ or $\\mathrm{P}$), which correlates qualitatively with the homolytic bond dissociation energy, and (ii) the stability of the conjugate base $E\\mathrm{H_{2}^{-}}$.\n\nFirst, the provided bond dissociation energies satisfy $BDE_{\\mathrm{N-H}}  BDE_{\\mathrm{P-H}}$, so the $\\mathrm{P-H}$ bond is weaker than the $\\mathrm{N-H}$ bond. Weaker $E$–H bonds are more readily cleaved in acid dissociation, which increases $K_{a}$. Thus this factor favors $\\mathrm{PH_{3}}$ being the stronger acid. This directly supports statement C and the consequence in statement A.\n\nSecond, consider conjugate-base stabilization. While nitrogen is more electronegative than phosphorus, $\\chi_{\\mathrm{N}}  \\chi_{\\mathrm{P}}$, which by itself would stabilize $\\mathrm{NH_{2}^{-}}$ relative to $\\mathrm{PH_{2}^{-}}$ and would, in isolation, favor greater acidity of $\\mathrm{NH_{3}}$. However, moving down the group, the larger radius and greater polarizability of phosphorus distribute the negative charge over a larger volume in $\\mathrm{PH_{2}^{-}}$, which stabilizes this anion relative to $\\mathrm{NH_{2}^{-}}$. This size/polarizability effect (together with the weaker $\\mathrm{P-H}$ bond) is a primary reason why acidity increases down the group. Therefore, the larger atomic radius argument in statement E is a valid reason that aligns with the observed trend, whereas the electronegativity argument in statement D, although factually stating $\\chi_{\\mathrm{N}}  \\chi_{\\mathrm{P}}$, would predict the opposite trend and hence is not a primary reason for the actual acidity difference.\n\nCombining these factors, the net result in aqueous solution is $K_{a,P}  K_{a,N}$, i.e., $\\mathrm{PH_{3}}$ is a stronger acid than $\\mathrm{NH_{3}}$.

By comparing a flexible, acyclic amine with its rigid, caged counterpart, you will analyze how steric hindrance and conformational strain can influence a nitrogen atom's ability to accept a proton. This exercise demonstrates that molecular shape and rigidity are critical factors in determining chemical reactivity [@problem_id:2007007].", "problem": "Triethylamine (TEA), (CH3CH2)3N, and quinuclidine, C7H13N, are both tertiary amines. Despite having similar inductive effects from their alkyl groups, their basicities differ. The strength of a base can be quantified by the pKa of its conjugate acid; a higher pKa value indicates a stronger base (i.e., the base has a stronger affinity for a proton). Experimental measurements show that the pKa of the conjugate acid of quinuclidine is approximately 11.0, while the pKa of the conjugate acid of TEA is approximately 10.75.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and primary explanation for why quinuclidine is a stronger base than triethylamine?\n\nA. The electron-donating inductive effect from the three ethyl groups in TEA is weaker than the inductive effect from the rigid carbon framework in quinuclidine, making the lone pair on TEA's nitrogen less available for protonation.\n\nB. The lone pair on the nitrogen atom in triethylamine is stabilized by resonance with the adjacent C-H sigma bonds (hyperconjugation), a phenomenon not possible in the rigid quinuclidine molecule, thus making TEA less basic.\n\nC. The neutral triethylamine molecule, due to its conformational flexibility, experiences more favorable solvation by polar solvents compared to the rigid and bulky quinuclidine. This greater stabilization of the neutral base makes it more reactive towards protons.\n\nD. In triethylamine, the flexible ethyl groups sterically hinder the nitrogen's lone pair and an increase in steric strain occurs upon protonation as bond angles are compressed. In quinuclidine, the rigid, \"tied-back\" structure makes the lone pair more sterically accessible and the geometry is pre-organized for the less-strained protonated state.\n\nE. Due to Bredt's rule, the nitrogen atom in the bridgehead position of quinuclidine is forced into a hybridization state with greater p-character in its lone pair orbital compared to triethylamine, which makes the lone pair more available for bonding.", "solution": "We begin by relating basicity to the acidity of the conjugate acid: for a base B, higher $pK_{a}$ of $\\mathrm{BH}^{+}$ indicates a stronger base. Given $pK_{a}(\\text{quinuclidinium}) \\approx 11.0$ and $pK_{a}(\\text{triethylammonium}) \\approx 10.75$, quinuclidine is the stronger base.\n\nWe assess the plausible factors:\n\n1) Inductive effects. Both are tertiary amines with alkyl groups; the net electron-donating inductive effects are broadly similar. There is no compelling reason that quinuclidine’s carbon framework exerts a significantly stronger net +I effect than three ethyl groups, so inductive differences are not the primary cause. This eliminates option A.\n\n2) Resonance or hyperconjugative stabilization of the nitrogen lone pair. The nitrogen lone pair in amines is not significantly stabilized by resonance with C–H $\\sigma$ bonds; such “hyperconjugation” is not a primary determinant of amine basicity, and any small effects would not selectively disadvantage quinuclidine. This eliminates option B.\n\n3) Solvation of the neutral base versus the conjugate acid. Basicity in solution reflects the free-energy change $B + \\mathrm{H}^{+} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{BH}^{+}$, where differential solvation of both B and $\\mathrm{BH}^{+}$ matters. Neutral tertiary amines are weak hydrogen-bond acceptors and do not experience dramatically greater solvation if more flexible; moreover, stabilizing the neutral base would lower, not raise, basicity. Option C is internally inconsistent and not the primary factor.\n\n4) Sterics and preorganization. Protonation converts a pyramidal amine to a tetrahedral ammonium center, increasing steric crowding around nitrogen. In triethylamine, the three flexible ethyl groups crowd the nitrogen lone pair, hindering approach of a proton and leading to increased steric strain upon forming the ammonium ion, which is also less effectively solvated due to shielding by the ethyl groups. In quinuclidine, the rigid bicyclic framework “ties back” the substituents so that the lone pair is more exposed and the geometry is preorganized for the protonated, tetrahedral-like state, reducing both steric penalty and reorganization energy; the resulting cation is also more accessible to solvation. This matches the observed higher $pK_{a}$ and is the primary explanation. This supports option D.\n\n5) Bredt’s rule and hybridization. Bredt’s rule concerns the placement of double bonds at bridgeheads in small bicyclic systems and does not force a special hybridization at a bridgehead nitrogen in a saturated bicyclic amine. Both TEA and quinuclidine have an approximately $sp^3$-hybridized nitrogen; invoking Bredt’s rule here is inappropriate. This eliminates option E.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and primary explanation is the steric accessibility and preorganization in quinuclidine compared to triethylamine.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2007007"}]}
