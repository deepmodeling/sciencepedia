Using the framework of Molecular Orbital (MO) theory, we can predict key properties of this molecule.\n\nConsider the formation of molecular orbitals for the CF radical from the valence atomic orbitals of carbon (2s, 2p) and fluorine (2s, 2p). Assume that interactions only occur between atomic orbitals of the same principal quantum number (i.e., n=2). The approximate energies of the valence atomic orbitals are:\n- Carbon 2s: -19.4 eV\n- Carbon 2p: -10.7 eV\n- Fluorine 2s: -40.2 eV\n- Fluorine 2p: -18.7 eV\n\nBased on the ground-state electronic configuration of the CF radical derived from MO theory, determine its bond order (the net number of covalent bonds) and its magnetic character.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes these two properties?\n\nA.

Carbon contributes $4$ and fluorine contributes $7$, so the CF radical has $11$ valence electrons.\n\nWithin MO theory limited to $n=2$ orbitals, we combine the $2s$ and $2p$ atomic orbitals of C and F. The given orbital energies show a very large energy mismatch for the $2s$ set (C $2s$ at $-19.4$ eV and F $2s$ at $-40.2$ eV), so the $\\sigma_{2s}$ and $\\sigma_{2s}^{*}$ pair will be formed but are strongly polarized and both will be filled early. Therefore, their net contribution to bond order will effectively cancel.\n\nThe $2p$ energies (C $2p$ at $-10.7$ eV and F $2p$ at $-18.7$ eV) are closer, so the $2p$ orbitals form the main bonding and antibonding MOs: $\\pi_{2p}$ (doubly degenerate), $\\sigma_{2p}$, and their antibonding counterparts $\\pi_{2p}^{*}$, $\\sigma_{2p}^{*}$. For second-row diatomics with this electron count and heteronuclear character similar to CO/NO, the bonding $2p$ set ($\\pi_{2p}$ and $\\sigma_{2p}$) lies below the antibonding $2p$ set, and the lowest antibonding is $\\pi_{2p}^{*}$ (lower than $\\sigma_{2p}^{*}$).

To determine this, we must construct a qualitative molecular orbital diagram for CO and analyze the character of the resulting orbitals.\n\n1.  **Valence Electrons and Atomic Orbitals (AOs):**\n    Carbon (C) has 4 valence electrons (2s², 2p²). Oxygen (O) has 6 valence electrons (2s², 2p⁴). The total number of valence electrons to place in the MOs is 4 + 6 = 10. The valence AOs are C(2s, 2pₓ, 2pᵧ, 2p₂) and O(2s, 2pₓ, 2pᵧ, 2p₂).\n\n2.  **General Principles of MO Formation in Heteronuclear Diatomics:**\n    -   AOs combine to form MOs. The number of MOs formed equals the number of AOs combined.\n    -   AOs that are closer in energy interact more strongly.\n    -   When two AOs of different energies interact, the resulting bonding MO is closer in energy and character to the lower-energy AO, while the anti-bonding MO is closer in energy and character to the higher-energy AO.\n    -   Oxygen is more electronegative than carbon, so its corresponding AOs are lower in energy: E(O 2s) < E(C 2s) and E(O 2p) < E(C 2p).\n\n3.  **Constructing the MO Diagram for CO:**\n    We will build the MOs based on symmetry (σ or π). The internuclear axis is the z-axis.\n\n    -   **σ MOs:** These are formed from AOs that are symmetric with respect to rotation about the z-axis (2s, 2p₂). In CO, all four of these AOs (C 2s, C 2p₂, O 2s, O 2p₂) can mix. This is known as s-p mixing.\n        -   The lowest energy σ MO, labeled **3σ**, is strongly bonding and is primarily composed of the O 2s AO, as it is the lowest energy valence AO.\n        -   The next σ MO, labeled **4σ**, is the corresponding anti-bonding orbital from the 2s interactions. It is primarily composed of the C 2s AO and lies significantly higher in energy than the 3σ.\n        -   The remaining σ MOs are formed from a combination of C 2p₂, O 2p₂, and also C 2s and O 2s due to s-p mixing. The MO labeled **5σ** results from this mixing.\n        -   The highest energy σ MO, labeled **6σ***, is strongly anti-bonding.\n\n    -   **π MOs:** These are formed from AOs that are anti-symmetric with respect to reflection through a plane containing the z-axis (2pₓ, 2pᵧ).\n        -   The C 2pₓ and O 2pₓ orbitals combine to form a bonding πₓ and an anti-bonding π*ₓ MO.\n        -   Similarly, the C 2pᵧ and O 2pᵧ orbitals form a bonding πᵧ and an anti-bonding π*ᵧ MO.\n        -   The two bonding π orbitals are degenerate and are collectively labeled **1π**. Since O is more electronegative, the 1π orbitals have a larger contribution from the O 2p AOs.\n        -   The two anti-bonding π* orbitals are also degenerate and are labeled **2π***. They have a larger contribution from the C 2p AOs.\n\n4.  **Energy Ordering and Electron Filling:**\n    Due to significant s-p mixing in second-period diatomics lighter than O₂, the 5σ MO is pushed up in energy, above the 1π MOs. The experimentally and computationally confirmed energy ordering of the valence MOs for CO is:\n    3σ < 4σ < 1π < 5σ < 2π* < 6σ*\n\n    We fill these orbitals with the 10 valence electrons:\n    -   (3σ)²\n    -   (4σ)²\n    -   (1π)⁴\n    -   (5σ)²\n    The total is 2 + 2 + 4 + 2 = 10 electrons. The highest energy orbital that is occupied is the **5σ** orbital. Therefore, the 5σ is the HOMO.\n\n5.  **Character of the HOMO (5σ orbital):**\n    -   **Symmetry:** It is a σ orbital, as indicated by its label.\n    -   **Localization and Character:** This is the crucial part. The lower energy AOs of the more electronegative oxygen atom (O 2s and O 2p) contribute heavily to the lower energy bonding MOs (3σ and 1π). To form the higher-energy 5σ MO while maintaining orthogonality with the lower MOs, there must be a substantial contribution from the higher-energy carbon AOs (C 2s and C 2p₂). The mixing results in an orbital that is best described as primarily non-bonding (it lies at a higher energy than the main bonding orbitals). Its electron density is not concentrated between the nuclei but is instead largely localized on the carbon atom, with a large lobe pointing away from the oxygen atom along the C-O axis. This \"lone pair\" on carbon is what makes CO an effective Lewis base and a ligand in metal carbonyl complexes, where it binds to the metal via the carbon atom.\n\n6.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    -   A: Incorrect. The HOMO is the 5σ, not a π orbital.\n    -   B: Incorrect. This describes a typical σ-bonding orbital. The 5σ HOMO is primarily non-bonding, and its density is not mainly between the nuclei.\n    -   C: Incorrect. The HOMO is the 5σ, not a π-antibonding orbital. The LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) is the 2π* orbital.\n    -   D: **Correct.** This accurately describes the 5σ HOMO: it has σ symmetry, is primarily non-bonding, and most importantly, is localized on the carbon atom with its density pointing away from the bond.\n    -   E: Incorrect. While the HOMO is a non-bonding σ orbital, it is localized on the carbon atom, not the oxygen atom.

While both have the same number of valence electrons and the same predicted bond order, their bond strengths differ significantly. This exercise will challenge you to look beyond bond order and explore how the energy match between atomic orbitals governs the extent of covalent bonding and overall molecular stability.

Experimental data reveals that the dissociation energy of the C-O bond is 1072 kJ/mol, while that of the B-F bond is significantly lower at 755 kJ/mol, indicating a stronger bond in carbon monoxide.\n\nBased on Molecular Orbital (MO) theory, which of the following statements provides the most accurate explanation for this difference in bond strength? For your reasoning, recall that the electronegativity of second-period elements increases in the order B < C < O < F, and that the energy of an atomic orbital decreases (becomes more stable) as the electronegativity of the atom increases.\n\nA. The bond order of CO is 3, while the bond order of BF is 2, leading to a stronger bond in CO.\n\nB. The smaller electronegativity difference between C and O compared to B and F results in a less polar, and therefore stronger, covalent bond in CO.\n\nC. The atomic orbitals of carbon and oxygen have a smaller energy difference than those of boron and fluorine, leading to more effective orbital mixing and greater stabilization of the bonding molecular orbitals in CO.\n\nD. CO has more electrons occupying bonding molecular orbitals than BF does, which directly results in a stronger and more stable bond.\n\nE. The Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) in CO is a bonding $\\pi$ orbital, whereas in BF it is a non-bonding $\\sigma$ orbital, contributing to the greater stability of CO.", "solution": "We begin by establishing the electron count and the baseline MO occupancy pattern. Both CO and BF are isoelectronic with a total of 10 valence electrons: for CO, carbon contributes 4 and oxygen 6; for BF, boron contributes 3 and fluorine 7.\n\nAccording to simple MO theory for second-period diatomics with 10 valence electrons, the qualitative filling (ignoring fine details of level ordering that do not change the total bonding versus antibonding counts for this electron number) proceeds as follows: fill $\\sigma(2s)$ with 2 electrons, $\\sigma^{\\ast}(2s)$ with 2 electrons, then place 6 electrons in the $2p$-derived MOs ($\\pi$ and $\\sigma$). The bond order is defined by\n$$\n\\text{bond order}=\\frac{N_{b}-N_{ab}}{2}.\n$$\nFor the 10-electron case, the occupied bonding orbitals are $\\sigma(2s)$ (2 e), $\\pi(2p)$ (4 e), and $\\sigma(2p)$ (2 e), totaling $N_{b}=8$, while $N_{ab}=2$ from $\\sigma^{\\ast}(2s)$. This yields\n$$\n\\text{bond order}=\\frac{8-2}{2}=3.\n$$\nTherefore, the simple MO electron count predicts the same bond order for both CO and BF, so option A, which asserts bond orders of 3 and 2 respectively, is not correct, and option D, which asserts a different number of bonding electrons, is not supported by the canonical filling.\n\nNext, we address how MO theory explains differences in bond strength for heteronuclear diatomics. In the Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO) treatment of a two-level interaction between atomic orbitals of energies $\\alpha_{A}$ and $\\alpha_{B}$ (on atoms $A$ and $B$) with resonance integral $\\beta$, the bonding and antibonding MO energies are\n$$\nE_{\\pm}=\\frac{\\alpha_{A}+\\alpha_{B}}{2}\\pm\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{2}\\right)^{2}+\\beta^{2}},\\quad \\Delta=\\alpha_{A}-\\alpha_{B}.\n$$\nElectronegativity increases along the second period in the order $\\text{B}<\\text{C}<\\text{O}<\\text{F}$, and the energy of an atomic orbital decreases as electronegativity increases. Thus the AO energies satisfy\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\text{F}}<\\alpha_{\\text{O}}<\\alpha_{\\text{C}}<\\alpha_{\\text{B}},\n$$\nso the energy mismatch magnitude is smaller for the C/O pair than for the B/F pair:\n$$\n|\\Delta_{\\text{CO}}|=|\\alpha_{\\text{C}}-\\alpha_{\\text{O}}|<|\\Delta_{\\text{BF}}|=|\\alpha_{\\text{B}}-\\alpha_{\\text{F}}|.\n$$\nFrom the expression for $E_{\\pm}$, the degree of mixing and the stabilization of the bonding MO depend on both $\\beta$ (overlap/coupling) and the energy mismatch $|\\Delta|$. As $|\\Delta|$ increases, the MOs localize on the more electronegative atom, the mixing coefficients on the other atom diminish, and the bonding MO energy approaches the lower AO energy, resulting in reduced covalent stabilization relative to the separated-atom limit. In other words, a smaller $|\\Delta|$ yields stronger orbital mixing and a larger effective bonding–antibonding splitting due to interaction, which stabilizes the bonding MOs more and strengthens the bond.\n\nApplying this to CO versus BF, the smaller AO energy gap between C and O leads to more effective mixing and greater stabilization of the bonding MOs than for B and F, consistent with the larger dissociation energy of CO. This is precisely the content of option C.\n\nWe briefly evaluate the remaining options. Option B appeals to polarity in a qualitative way but does not provide the correct MO-theoretic mechanism; polarity alone does not determine bond strength, whereas AO energy mismatch and mixing directly control bonding MO stabilization. Option E is incorrect: in CO the HOMO is a largely nonbonding $\\sigma$ lone pair centered on carbon rather than a bonding $\\pi$ orbital; for BF, the highest occupied orbitals are largely nonbonding fluorine lone pairs, but the claim contrasting a bonding $\\pi$ HOMO in CO with a nonbonding $\\sigma$ HOMO in BF mischaracterizes CO.\n\nTherefore, the MO-theory-based explanation that most directly and accurately accounts for the stronger CO bond is that the smaller AO energy difference in CO leads to more effective orbital mixing and greater stabilization of bonding MOs, which is option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2004478"}]}
