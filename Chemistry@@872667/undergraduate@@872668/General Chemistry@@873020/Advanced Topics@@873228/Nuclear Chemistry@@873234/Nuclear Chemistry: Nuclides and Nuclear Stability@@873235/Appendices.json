These \"magic numbers\" of protons or neutrons create exceptionally stable nuclei. This exercise [@problem_id:2009041] challenges you to apply this principle to predict which of two nuclides is significantly more stable, illustrating the profound impact of filled nuclear shells.", "problem": "In the field of nuclear chemistry, the long-term stability of an atomic nucleus is of paramount importance for various applications, from nuclear power to the safe storage of radioactive waste. A key concept for predicting nuclear stability is the nuclear shell model, which posits that nuclei with specific numbers of protons or neutrons are exceptionally stable. These numbers are known as \"magic numbers.\" For both protons and neutrons, the magic numbers are 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, and 126. A nuclide with a magic number of both protons and neutrons is termed \"doubly magic\" and exhibits remarkable stability.\n\nA materials scientist is tasked with selecting an isotope to act as a stable, inert matrix for a new type of nuclear battery. Two candidate isotopes of the same element are being considered:\n- Nuclide A has 82 protons and 120 neutrons.\n- Nuclide B has 82 protons and 126 neutrons.\n\nBased on the principles of nuclear stability and the concept of magic numbers, which of the following statements correctly assesses the relative stability of the two nuclides and provides the correct reasoning?\n\nA. Nuclide A is more stable because its neutron-to-proton ratio is lower, placing it closer to the line of stability typically observed for nuclides of this atomic mass.\n\nB. Both nuclides are expected to have similar stability because they have the same number of protons, and the proton number is the main factor governing nuclear stability.\n\nC. Nuclide B is significantly more stable because its proton number is a magic number and its neutron number is also a magic number, making it a \"doubly magic\" nuclide.\n\nD. Nuclide A is more stable because adding more neutrons, as in Nuclide B, generally decreases the binding energy per nucleon beyond a certain point due to neutron-neutron repulsion.\n\nE. Nuclide B is less stable because its large number of neutrons makes it highly susceptible to beta decay, a common decay mode for neutron-rich isotopes.", "solution": "Define the magic-number set for both protons and neutrons as $\\mathcal{M}=\\{2,8,20,28,50,82,126\\}$, according to the nuclear shell model. A nucleus is termed doubly magic, and thus exhibits exceptional stability, if and only if its proton number $Z \\in \\mathcal{M}$ and its neutron number $N \\in \\mathcal{M}$; this corresponds to filled shells for both nucleon types, yielding enhanced binding.\n\nFor Nuclide A, we have $Z_{A}=82$ and $N_{A}=120$. Check magic-number status: $Z_{A}=82 \\in \\mathcal{M}$ while $N_{A}=120 \\notin \\mathcal{M}$. Therefore, Nuclide A is singly magic (closed proton shell only). For Nuclide B, we have $Z_{B}=82$ and $N_{B}=126$. Check magic-number status: $Z_{B}=82 \\in \\mathcal{M}$ and $N_{B}=126 \\in \\mathcal{M}$. Therefore, Nuclide B is doubly magic (closed proton and neutron shells), which the shell model predicts to be significantly more stable due to enhanced binding associated with full shells.\n\nTo address competing rationales: comparing neutron-to-proton ratios gives $R_{A}=\\frac{N_{A}}{Z_{A}}=\\frac{120}{82}$ and $R_{B}=\\frac{126}{82}$. While the line of stability for heavy nuclei trends to $R>1$ due to increasing Coulomb repulsion among protons, the decisive feature here is shell closure; doubly magic nuclei are known to be exceptionally stable, often representing local maxima in binding energy per nucleon. Hence, a lower $R$ does not override the stabilizing effect of double magicity (disfavoring option A). The claim that the same $Z$ alone dictates similar stability is false because neutron shell closures crucially affect stability (disfavoring option B). The suggestion that added neutrons generally decrease binding due to neutron-neutron repulsion neglects the dominant role of the short-range attractive nuclear force and shell effects; near a magic number, additional neutrons up to shell closure increase stability (disfavoring option D). Finally, while neutron-rich nuclides can undergo beta decay, a doubly magic configuration like $Z=82$, $N=126$ is particularly stable and not rendered less stable by mere neutron richness (disfavoring option E).\n\nTherefore, Nuclide B, with $Z=82$ and $N=126$, is doubly magic and significantly more stable.
