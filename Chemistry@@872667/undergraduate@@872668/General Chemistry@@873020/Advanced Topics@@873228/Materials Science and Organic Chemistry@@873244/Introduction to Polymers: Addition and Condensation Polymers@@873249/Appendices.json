The polymers from Batch A and Batch B are structurally identical because they are both forms of polybutene.\n\nB. The polymers from Batch A and Batch B are structurally different, but they cannot be considered isomers of one another because the term 'isomer' does not apply to macromolecules with variable chain lengths.\n\nC.
