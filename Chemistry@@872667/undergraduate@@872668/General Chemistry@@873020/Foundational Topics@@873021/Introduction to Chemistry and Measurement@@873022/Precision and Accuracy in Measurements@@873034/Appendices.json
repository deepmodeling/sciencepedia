The student places a small amount of the liquid into a flask of a precisely known volume, $V = 250.0 \\text{ mL}$. The flask is heated in a boiling water bath, causing the liquid to vaporize and fill the flask, expelling the air. The temperature of the bath is measured to be $T = 100.0\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$. The student assumes the pressure of the vapor in the flask is equal to the atmospheric pressure. Instead of using a barometer in the lab, the student obtains the day's barometric pressure from a nearby airport located at sea level, which reports $P = 1.013 \\times 10^5 \\text{ Pa}$.

When cooling the flask, not all of the vapor condensed, and a small amount escaped through the pinhole before the flask's mass was measured.\n\nE. The student forgot to convert the volume of the flask from milliliters (mL) to the standard SI unit of cubic meters (m$^3$) before performing the calculation.", "solution": "Use the ideal gas law in the form $M=\\frac{mRT}{PV}$.

A fractional underestimate of about $0.05$ corresponds to $P_{\\text{true}}/P_{\\text{used}}\\approx 0.95$, which is consistent with mountain altitude.\n\nCheck the other options by sign and plausibility:\n- For A: $M\\propto T$. If the actual boiling temperature is lower than the stated $T$ but the thermometer mistakenly reads higher (student uses too large $T$), then $M_{\\text{calc}}$ would be too large, not too small. Hence A cannot explain a lower result.\n- For B: With real-gas behavior $PV=ZnRT$. Using the ideal formula gives $M_{\\text{calc}}=\\frac{mRT}{PV}=\\frac{M_{\\text{true}}}{Z}$. At these conditions, intermolecular attractions typically make $Z<1$, implying $M_{\\text{calc}}>M_{\\text{true}}$, the opposite of the observation.\n- For D: During cooling the internal pressure drops below ambient, so outflow of vapor through a pinhole is not physically favored; air would be drawn in instead. Any such loss would not produce a consistent, systematic $0.05$ bias tied to the same direction each time. This is less plausible than the pressure explanation.\n- For E: Failing to convert mL to m$^{3}$ would introduce an error by a factor of $10^{6}$, not a small fractional bias like $0.05$.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible explanation is the use of the higher sea-level pressure instead of the lower local atmospheric pressure at altitude, which makes the calculated molar mass too low.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2013063"}]}
