Evaporate the water to recover the salt.", "solution": "Goal: separate a heterogeneous solid mixture of iron filings (Fe), sand (SiO2), and table salt (NaCl) into pure, dry solids using physical properties: magnetism, differential solubility in water, filtration, and evaporation.\n\nPrinciples used:\n- Ferromagnetism: iron filings are attracted to a magnet; SiO2 and NaCl are not. Thus, magnetic separation isolates Fe from the dry mixture efficiently without wetting or contamination.\n- Solubility: NaCl is highly soluble in water; SiO2 is effectively insoluble in water. Thus, adding water to the nonmagnetic residue dissolves NaCl while leaving SiO2 as a solid.\n- Filtration: a heterogeneous mixture of an insoluble solid and a solution can be separated; filter paper retains the insoluble SiO2 (residue), while the NaCl(aq) passes through (filtrate).\n- Evaporation: removing the solvent (water) from the NaCl(aq) filtrate yields solid NaCl crystals. Symbolically, dissolution corresponds to NaCl(s) dissolving into ions in water, and evaporation reverses this by removing solvent to re-form solid NaCl.\n\nCorrect, efficient sequence analysis:\n\nOption A:\n1. Use a magnet to remove the iron filings. This exploits ferromagnetism to isolate Fe from the dry mixture cleanly, preventing wetting and corrosion and minimizing cross-contamination.\n2. Add water to the remaining solid mixture and stir. This dissolves NaCl while SiO2 remains as an insoluble solid. Conceptually: NaCl(s) dissolves in water to give an aqueous solution, while SiO2(s) remains undissolved.\n3. Filter the resulting mixture. The filter retains SiO2 as the solid residue; the NaCl solution passes as the filtrate.\n4. Evaporate the water from the liquid that passes through the filter. Removal of solvent yields solid NaCl. After filtration, the SiO2 residue can be dried to obtain pure, dry sand; the Fe recovered in step 1 is already dry or can be briefly dried if needed. This sequence is efficient and correct.\n\nOption B:\n1–4 involve first wetting all components, then filtering to collect sand (but Fe would also be retained with sand), then evaporating to get NaCl, and finally using a magnet on wet sand to pull out Fe. This is less efficient and less correct operationally: using a magnet on a wet solid introduces adherence of wet particulates and potential oxidation of Fe, increasing contamination and drying steps.\n\nOption C:\nUsing a magnet on a slurry to extract Fe leads to wet, salt-contaminated Fe that requires rinsing and drying, which is inefficient and risks loss. Subsequent steps otherwise mirror the standard approach, but this ordering is inferior to removing Fe when dry.\n\nOption D:\nStates that NaCl can be evaporated from the mixture by heating. This is incorrect: NaCl does not evaporate under typical lab heating; it has negligible vapor pressure at such temperatures. Heating would not selectively remove NaCl and thus cannot effect the intended separation.\n\nOption E:\nProposes filtering the initial dry mixture, which is not a valid filtration operation because filtration separates phases in a liquid-solid mixture; it cannot separate dry solids of similar sizes without a fluid medium. This is not correct.\n\nTherefore, the most efficient and correct method is the sequence in A, which correctly and efficiently applies magnetism first on the dry mixture, then exploits solubility and filtration, and finally evaporation to recover each component as a pure, dry solid.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1983845"}, {"introduction": "Chemists classify unknown materials not by sight alone, but through a logical sequence of experimental tests.

To determine its fundamental classification, a series of laboratory tests are performed. The observations are as follows:\n\n1.  **Initial Observation**: Under an optical microscope, the powder appears to consist of crystalline particles that are uniform in shape and color.\n2.  **Solubility Test**: When the powder is added to a beaker of pure water and stirred, a significant portion of it dissolves, but a noticeable amount of white solid settles at the bottom and does not dissolve, even with prolonged stirring.\n3.  **Physical Separation**: The aqueous suspension from the solubility test is passed through filter paper. A clear, colorless liquid (the filtrate) passes through, and a white solid is retained on the filter paper.\n4.  **Thermal Analysis of Original Powder**: A sample of the original, dry powder is heated slowly. It begins to melt at approximately 148 °C and is not fully liquid until the temperature reaches 162 °C.\n5.  **Analysis of Components**:\n    a. The clear filtrate is heated to evaporate the water, leaving behind a white crystalline solid. This solid is found to have a sharp, constant melting point at 801 °C.\n    b. The white solid from the filter paper is dried.

This process, known as electrolysis, causes the substance to visibly decompose, producing two new and distinct substances at the electrodes.\n\nBased on this complete set of experimental evidence, what is the most accurate classification of the original unknown white powder?\n\nA. A pure substance.\nB. A homogeneous mixture.\nC. A heterogeneous mixture of elements.\nD. A heterogeneous mixture where at least one component is a compound.\nE. A solution containing an element and a compound.", "solution": "The problem requires us to classify an unknown white powder based on a series of experimental observations. We will analyze the result of each test to deduce the nature of the substance.\n\nFirst, let's distinguish between pure substances and mixtures. A pure substance consists of only one type of element or one type of compound and has fixed chemical and physical properties, such as a sharp, constant melting point. A mixture consists of two or more substances that are physically combined and can be separated by physical means. Mixtures have properties that can vary, and they typically melt over a range of temperatures.\n\nObservation 4 states that the original powder melts over a range of temperatures (148 °C to 162 °C). This is a classic characteristic of a mixture, not a pure substance. Furthermore, Observations 2 and 3 show that the powder can be separated into two different components—a water-soluble part and a water-insoluble part—using the physical process of dissolution and filtration. The ability to separate the substance into components via physical means confirms that it is a mixture. This eliminates option A, which classifies it as a pure substance.\n\nNext, we must determine if the mixture is homogeneous or heterogeneous. A homogeneous mixture has a uniform composition throughout (e.g., a salt solution), while a heterogeneous mixture has a non-uniform composition where the different components can be distinguished. Observation 2 notes that a solid remained undissolved in the water. Observation 3 confirms that this undissolved solid could be separated by filtration. This means there were at least two distinct phases present (a solid phase and an aqueous phase), which is the definition of a heterogeneous mixture. This eliminates option B (homogeneous mixture) and option E (a solution, which is a type of homogeneous mixture).\n\nNow we must classify the components of the mixture. Observation 5 reveals that both the soluble component (recovered from the filtrate) and the insoluble component (from the filter paper) have sharp, constant melting points. This indicates that the two components of the mixture are themselves pure substances.\n\nFinally, we need to determine if these pure substances are elements or compounds. An element cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical means, whereas a compound can. Observation 6 describes the electrolysis of the molten soluble component. Electrolysis is a chemical process that uses electricity to drive a chemical decomposition. The observation that this substance decomposed into \"two new and distinct substances\" is definitive proof that it is a compound. If it were an element, it could not be broken down in this manner.\n\nSynthesizing our findings:\n1.  The original powder is a mixture (melts over a range, physically separable).\n2.  The mixture is heterogeneous (contains a water-insoluble component separable by filtration).\n3.  The mixture is composed of at least two pure substances (the separated components have sharp melting points).\n4.  At least one of these pure substance components is a compound (it decomposes upon electrolysis).\n\nLet's evaluate the remaining options:\nC. A heterogeneous mixture of elements. This is incorrect because we have proven that at least one component is a compound.\nD. A heterogeneous mixture where at least one component is a compound. This perfectly matches our synthesized conclusions. The powder is a heterogeneous mixture, and we have confirmed one of its components is a compound. This is the most accurate and certain conclusion that can be drawn from the evidence provided.\n\nTherefore, based on all the evidence, the original powder is a heterogeneous mixture containing at least one compound.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1983820"}, {"introduction": "The concepts of elements, compounds, and mixtures are not just abstract categories; they are essential for describing the world around us, even in complex, dynamic systems.
