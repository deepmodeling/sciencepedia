This practice challenges you to act as a materials scientist and determine this key property for a new alloy using calorimetry, a classic experimental technique. By applying the principle of conservation of energy to a system where heat is transferred from a hot object to a cooler one, you can calculate the unknown specific heat and gain insight into the material's potential applications.

To determine its specific heat capacity, an experiment is conducted using calorimetry. A sample of the alloy with a mass of 150.0 g is heated in an oven to a uniform temperature of 98.5 °C. The hot sample is then quickly transferred into an insulated coffee-cup calorimeter. The calorimeter contains 200.0 g of liquid toluene, which is a common organic solvent, initially at a temperature of 22.0 °C. The heat capacity of the calorimeter apparatus itself has been previously determined to be 45.0 J/°C. The specific heat capacity of toluene is 1.70 J/(g·°C).
