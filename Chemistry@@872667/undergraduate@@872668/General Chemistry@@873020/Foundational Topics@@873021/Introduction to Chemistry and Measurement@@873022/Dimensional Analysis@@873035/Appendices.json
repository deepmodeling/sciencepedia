This thin sheet is known as gold leaf.\n\nSuppose one troy ounce of pure gold is perfectly hammered into a uniform foil that completely covers the area of a standard American football playing field (excluding the end zones).

The volume, $V$, of the foil can be expressed as its area, $A$, multiplied by its thickness, $T$.\n$$V = A \\times T$$\nTherefore, the thickness can be calculated as:\n$$T = \\frac{V}{A}$$\nWe can find the volume from the mass and density of gold, and the area from the given dimensions of the football field. We will perform the calculations by converting all units to a consistent system, such as meters for length and grams for mass.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the mass of the gold in grams.**\nThe problem states the mass of gold is one troy ounce.

Thus, $V = m/\\rho$.\nFirst, we must convert the density from $\\text{g/cm}^3$ to $\\text{g/m}^3$ to be consistent with our area unit.\n$$1 \\text{ m} = 100 \\text{ cm} \\implies (1 \\text{ m})^3 = (100 \\text{ cm})^3 = 1,000,000 \\text{ cm}^3 = 10^6 \\text{ cm}^3$$\nSo the conversion for density is:\n$$\\rho = 19.3 \\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{cm}^3} \\times \\frac{10^6 \\text{ cm}^3}{1 \\text{ m}^3} = 19.3 \\times 10^6 \\text{ g/m}^3$$\nNow we can calculate the volume:\n$$V = \\frac{m}{\\rho} = \\frac{31.1035 \\text{ g}}{19.3 \\times 10^6 \\text{ g/m}^3} = 1.61158... \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}^3$$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the thickness in meters.**\nUsing the relationship $T = V/A$:\n$$T = \\frac{1.61158... \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}^3}{4463.59... \\text{ m}^2} = 3.6105... \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}$$\n\n**Step 5: Convert the thickness to nanometers (nm) and apply significant figures.**\nThe required unit is nanometers.
