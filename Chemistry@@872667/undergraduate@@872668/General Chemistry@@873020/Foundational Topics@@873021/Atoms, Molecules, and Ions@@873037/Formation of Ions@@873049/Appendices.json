Group 15", "solution": "Successive ionization energies increase because removing an electron from a species with a higher positive charge requires more energy due to increased effective nuclear attraction. For a main-group element with $n_{v}$ valence electrons, the first $n_{v}$ ionizations remove valence electrons and are relatively smaller, while a large jump occurs when the next ionization would remove a core electron. Symbolically, the diagnostic pattern is:\n$$\nIE_{1}  IE_{2}  \\dots  IE_{n_{v}} \\ll IE_{n_{v}+1}.\n$$\nFrom the data for element X:\n- $IE_{1} = 419\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$,\n- $IE_{2} = 3052\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$,\n- $IE_{3} = 4420\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$,\n- $IE_{4} = 5877\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$.\nThe dominant jump occurs between $IE_{1}$ and $IE_{2}$, since $IE_{2} \\gg IE_{1}$. This indicates that after removal of one electron, the species reaches a stable closed-shell (noble-gas-like) configuration, and any further ionization would remove a core electron. Therefore, $n_{v} = 1$.\n\nIn the main group, the number of valence electrons for Groups 1, 2, 13, 14, and 15 is $1, 2, 3, 4,$ and $5$, respectively. A large jump after the first ionization corresponds to one valence electron, i.e., Group 1 (alkali metals). This also matches the application requirement: easy formation of a $+1$ ion (small $IE_{1}$) and strong resistance to forming $+2$ (very large $IE_{2}$).\n\nHence, element X most likely belongs to Group 1.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1994692"}, {"introduction": "The concepts of ionization energy extend beyond single atoms; they allow us to predict the energetic feasibility of reactions between different species.
