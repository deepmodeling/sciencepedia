An element in Group 17 (halogens).", "solution": "We are asked to infer the likely position of a pure elemental solid (Element Z) on the periodic table from its observed physical and electrical properties. The key observations are:\n- It is a solid at standard temperature and pressure with a silvery-gray luster.\n- It is brittle (shatters under hammering) rather than malleable.\n- It conducts electricity, but with conductivity significantly lower than typical metals such as copper or aluminum.\n- Its electrical conductivity increases as temperature increases from 300 K to 500 K.\n\nFrom solid-state physics, electrical conductivity is given by\n$$\n\\sigma = n q \\mu,\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the charge carrier concentration, $q$ is the elementary charge, and $\\mu$ is the carrier mobility.\n\nFor typical metals (e.g., Group 1 and d-block metals), the carrier concentration $n$ is approximately temperature independent, while the mobility $\\mu$ decreases with temperature due to increased phonon scattering. In simple models, the scattering time $\\tau$ decreases roughly as $\\tau \\propto 1/T$ at sufficiently high temperatures, and since $\\mu \\propto \\tau$, one expects\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mu}{dT} < 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{d\\sigma}{dT} < 0.\n$$\nEquivalently, the resistivity is often modeled as $\\rho(T) \\approx \\rho_{0} + \\alpha T$ with $\\alpha>0$, so $\\sigma(T) = 1/\\rho(T)$ decreases with $T$. Thus, metals generally have a negative temperature coefficient of conductivity.\n\nFor intrinsic semiconductors (and many metalloids with semiconducting behavior), the carrier concentration is strongly temperature dependent. The intrinsic carrier concentration is\n$$\nn_{i}(T) \\propto T^{3/2} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_{g}}{2 k_{B} T}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $E_{g}$ is the band gap and $k_{B}$ is Boltzmann’s constant. The conductivity in the intrinsic regime is\n$$\n\\sigma(T) \\approx q \\left(\\mu_{n} + \\mu_{p}\\right) n_{i}(T),\n$$\nso, despite mobilities $\\mu_{n}$ and $\\mu_{p}$ typically decreasing with $T$, the exponential increase of $n_{i}(T)$ dominates over the temperature range stated, yielding\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{dT} > 0.\n$$\nTherefore, the observed positive temperature coefficient of conductivity between 300 K and 500 K is characteristic of semiconductors/metalloids rather than typical metals.\n\nThe mechanical property that Element Z shatters under a hammer indicates brittleness, which is characteristic of materials with directional covalent bonding (e.g., network solids or metalloids), not of metals, which are typically malleable and ductile due to non-directional metallic bonding.\n\nThe silvery-gray luster is consistent with many metalloids (e.g., Si, Ge, As, Sb, Te), which often have a metallic luster despite not being good metals. Their conductivities are lower than those of typical metals but non-negligible, and they often exhibit $\\frac{d\\sigma}{dT}>0$.\n\nWe now evaluate the options:\n- A (Group 1 alkali metals): These are soft, malleable, highly conducting metals with $\\frac{d\\sigma}{dT}<0$. The brittleness and positive temperature coefficient contradict this.\n- B (d-block transition metals): Also malleable, highly conducting, with $\\frac{d\\sigma}{dT}<0$. Again inconsistent with brittleness and the observed temperature trend.\n- C (Group 18 noble gases): These are gases at standard conditions (not solids) and are electrical insulators as elements. This contradicts the given solid and conducting behavior.\n- D (p-block along the stair-step line, i.e., metalloids): Typically brittle, silvery-gray luster, moderate conductivity, and $\\frac{d\\sigma}{dT}>0$ due to semiconducting behavior. This matches all observations.\n- E (Group 17 halogens): As elements, they are nonmetallic (mostly molecular insulators at standard conditions; iodine is a brittle crystalline solid with luster but very poor conductivity). The statement that Element Z is an electrical conductor with conductivity that increases with temperature could superficially resemble a very poor semiconductor; however, the combination of silvery luster, brittle behavior, and appreciable conductivity lower than but comparable in kind to metals is most consistently explained by metalloids rather than halogens.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that Element Z is a metalloid located in the p-block along the diagonal stair-step line separating metals from nonmetals.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2003879"}, {"introduction": "Why can one element form both one of the hardest insulators and a soft electrical conductor? This classic question, explored through the allotropes of carbon, reveals a fundamental principle: an element's properties are dictated by its atomic structure and bonding. This practice [@problem_id:2003927] challenges you to connect the macroscopic property of electrical conductivity to the microscopic world of electron hybridization and delocalization.", "problem": "Carbon is a nonmetal that exists in several allotropic forms, two of the most well-known being diamond and graphite. Despite both being composed solely of carbon atoms, their physical properties are strikingly different. Diamond is a transparent, extremely hard material that is an excellent electrical insulator. In contrast, graphite is an opaque, soft material that is a moderate electrical conductor.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for this difference in electrical conductivity between diamond and graphite?\n\nA. Graphite consists of $sp^2$ hybridized carbon atoms forming sheets, with delocalized pi electrons that are mobile within the sheets, allowing for charge transport. Diamond consists of $sp^3$ hybridized carbon atoms, where all valence electrons are localized in strong sigma bonds, preventing electron mobility.\n\nB. The carbon atoms in diamond are packed much more densely than in graphite. This high-density packing restricts the movement of valence electrons, making it an insulator. The lower density of graphite allows electrons more space to move, resulting in conductivity.\n\nC. In graphite, weak van der Waals forces hold the atomic layers together, and these weak forces allow electrons to easily jump between layers, creating a conductive pathway. In diamond's rigid three-dimensional lattice, no such pathway exists.\n\nD. The C-C bonds in diamond are exclusively strong sigma bonds which cannot conduct electricity. The bonding in graphite can be described by resonance structures involving alternating single and double bonds, and these double bonds contain mobile electrons responsible for conductivity.\n\nE. Diamond is formed at much higher pressures than graphite, which forces the electrons into fixed, non-conductive, low-energy orbitals. Graphite, formed at lower pressures, has electrons in higher-energy orbitals that are free to move.", "solution": "To determine which statement most accurately explains the difference in electrical conductivity between diamond and graphite, use the solid-state criterion for electrical conduction: a solid conducts when it has delocalized electrons and available electronic states at or infinitesimally above the Fermi level $E_{F}$, i.e., a partially filled band or bands that touch at $E_{F}$. If the valence band is completely filled and separated from the conduction band by a large band gap $E_{g}$, the material is an insulator at ordinary conditions due to the lack of mobile charge carriers.\n\nApply this to diamond:\n- Each carbon atom in diamond is $sp^{3}$ hybridized, forming four strong $\\sigma$ bonds in a three-dimensional tetrahedral network. All four valence electrons per atom are localized in these $\\sigma$ bonds.\n- Band-theoretically, the bonding $\\sigma$ states form a filled valence band, and the corresponding antibonding $\\sigma^{*}$ states form an empty conduction band, with a large band gap $E_{g}$ between them. Thus there are no available states at $E_{F}$ and no delocalized carriers, making diamond an electrical insulator.\n\nApply this to graphite:\n- Each carbon atom in graphite is $sp^{2}$ hybridized, forming three in-plane $\\sigma$ bonds in a hexagonal sheet, leaving one electron in a $p_{z}$ orbital perpendicular to the plane.\n- The $p_{z}$ orbitals overlap laterally across the sheet to form extended, delocalized $\\pi$ and $\\pi^{*}$ bands. In ideal graphite, these bands touch at $E_{F}$ (semimetallic behavior), providing delocalized carriers within the planes. This yields significant in-plane electrical conductivity. Interlayer coupling is weak (van der Waals), so conduction is highly anisotropic and much poorer perpendicular to the layers, but the key is the presence of delocalized $\\pi$ electrons and available states at $E_{F}$ within the sheets.\n\nEvaluate the options against these principles:\n- A correctly identifies $sp^{2}$ hybridization in graphite, the formation of delocalized $\\pi$ electrons mobile within the sheets, and $sp^{3}$ hybridization in diamond with electrons localized in $\\sigma$ bonds, which fundamentally explains the conductivity contrast via band formation and electron delocalization.\n- B incorrectly attributes conductivity to density differences; packing density does not set whether bands are filled or delocalized carriers exist.\n- C misstates the mechanism: weak van der Waals forces do not create easy interlayer electron hopping pathways; conduction is primarily within layers, and interlayer motion is limited.\n- D uses resonance language and claims $\\sigma$ bonds cannot conduct; while $\\pi$ electrons are indeed responsible for conduction in graphite, the rigorous explanation is band delocalization, not alternating single/double bonds, and $\\sigma$ bands can, in principle, contribute if partially filled; in diamond they are fully filled with a large $E_{g}$, which is the real reason for insulating behavior.\n- E incorrectly ties conductivity to formation pressure and “fixed low-energy orbitals”; pressure history does not determine the existence of delocalized bands at $E_{F}$ in the way described.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental explanation is given by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2003927"}, {"introduction": "Moving from single elements to their compounds, this final practice asks you to predict chemical behavior based on periodic trends. By examining a series of oxides from elements across a period, you will see a clear pattern in their acid-base properties. This exercise [@problem_id:2003883] reinforces the powerful idea that an element's location in the periodic table allows us to anticipate how its compounds will react.", "problem": "A materials scientist is investigating the chemical properties of oxides from elements in the fourth period of the periodic table. High-purity samples of gallium(III) oxide ($Ga_2O_3$), germanium(IV) oxide ($GeO_2$), and arsenic(V) oxide ($As_2O_5$) are synthesized. These correspond to the highest stable oxidation states for gallium (Ga), germanium (Ge), and arsenic (As), respectively. To probe their acid-base character, the scientist prepares two separate aqueous test solutions: a strong acid (hydrochloric acid, HCl) and a strong base (sodium hydroxide, NaOH). The experiment involves adding a small amount of each oxide to separate beakers of the acidic and basic solutions to observe if dissolution occurs. Dissolution in this context is indicative of a chemical reaction between the oxide and the solute (acid or base).\n\nBased on the established periodic trends concerning metallic, metalloid, and non-metallic character, which one of the following statements most accurately predicts the experimental outcomes?\n\nA. $Ga_2O_3$ will dissolve in the acid, $GeO_2$ will remain insoluble in both solutions, and $As_2O_5$ will dissolve in the base.\n\nB.

A general trend exists:\n- Metallic character decreases from left to right across a period.\n- Oxides of metals tend to be basic.\n- Oxides of nonmetals tend to be acidic.\n- Oxides of elements at the borderline between metals and nonmetals (i.e., metalloids) are often amphoteric, meaning they can react as both an acid and a base.\n- For a given element that forms multiple oxides, the acidity of the oxide increases with the oxidation state of the element.\n\nThe problem considers the highest oxidation state oxides for Gallium (Ga), Germanium (Ge), and Arsenic (As), which are all in Period 4.\n\n1.  **Gallium(III) oxide ($Ga_2O_3$)**: Gallium is in Group 13. It is a post-transition metal, located near the metalloid staircase. As such, its oxide, $Ga_2O_3$, is expected to be amphoteric.\n    - As a base, it reacts with strong acids: $Ga_2O_3(s) + 6H^+(aq) \\rightarrow 2Ga^{3+}(aq) + 3H_2O(l)$.\n    - As an acid, it reacts with strong bases: $Ga_2O_3(s) + 2OH^-(aq) + 3H_2O(l) \\rightarrow 2[Ga(OH)_4]^-(aq)$.\n    Therefore, $Ga_2O_3$ will dissolve in both the acidic (HCl) and basic (NaOH) solutions.\n\n2.  **Germanium(IV) oxide ($GeO_2$)**: Germanium is in Group 14 and is classified as a metalloid. It is to the right of Gallium, so it has less metallic character. Its oxide, $GeO_2$, is also expected to be amphoteric, but with a more pronounced acidic character compared to $Ga_2O_3$.\n    - As a base, it reacts with strong acids: $GeO_2(s) + 4H^+(aq) \\rightarrow Ge^{4+}(aq) + 2H_2O(l)$ (or more complex halo-complexes).\n    - As an acid, it reacts with strong bases: $GeO_2(s) + 2OH^-(aq) \\rightarrow GeO_3^{2-}(aq) + H_2O(l)$.\n    Therefore, $GeO_2$ will also dissolve in both the acidic and basic solutions.\n\n3.  **Arsenic(V) oxide ($As_2O_5$)**: Arsenic is in Group 15 and is also a metalloid, but it exhibits significant non-metallic properties. It is to the right of Germanium, continuing the trend of decreasing metallic character. The oxide is in a very high oxidation state (+5), which strongly enhances its acidic nature. Therefore, $As_2O_5$ is an acidic oxide.\n    - As an acid, it will not react with other acids like HCl.\n    - As an acid, it will react readily with strong bases in a neutralization reaction to form arsenate salts: $As_2O_5(s) + 6OH^-(aq) \\rightarrow 2AsO_4^{3-}(aq) + 3H_2O(l)$.\n    Therefore, $As_2O_5$ will dissolve only in the basic (NaOH) solution.\n\nCombining these findings:\n- $Ga_2O_3$: Dissolves in both acid and base.\n- $GeO_2$: Dissolves in both acid and base.\n- $As_2O_5$: Dissolves only in base.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\n- A. Incorrect. It claims $GeO_2$ is inert and ignores the amphoterism of $Ga_2O_3$ (reaction with base).\n- B. Incorrect.

This statement accurately describes the amphoteric nature of $Ga_2O_3$ and $GeO_2$ (dissolving in both) and the acidic nature of $As_2O_5$ (dissolving only in base).\n- E. Incorrect. It wrongly classifies $Ga_2O_3$ as purely basic and ignores that $GeO_2$ is amphoteric.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2003883"}]}
