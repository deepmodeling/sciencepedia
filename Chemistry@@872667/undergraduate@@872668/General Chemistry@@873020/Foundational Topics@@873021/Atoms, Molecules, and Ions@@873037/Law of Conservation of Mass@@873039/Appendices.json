This first practice is a thought experiment designed to challenge your intuition and solidify your understanding of this core principle [@problem_id:2001722]. By considering a reaction that produces a gas inside a sealed container, you can confront common misconceptions about how changes in state, pressure, or energy relate to the total mass of a system.", "problem": "An experiment is designed to investigate the law of conservation of mass. A chemist places 15.0 g of solid sodium bicarbonate ($\\text{NaHCO}_3$) into a rigid, sealed 1.0 L container. Suspended inside the same container, but kept separate from the sodium bicarbonate, is a small, sealed glass vial containing 50.0 mL of a 2.0 M aqueous solution of acetic acid ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{COOH}$). The entire assembly (the rigid container, its contents, and the vial) is placed on a high-precision digital balance, and its total mass is recorded as $M_1$.\n\nThe entire container is then shaken, causing the inner vial to break and allowing the acetic acid to react completely with the sodium bicarbonate. The reaction produces aqueous sodium acetate, liquid water, and carbon dioxide gas:\n$$\\text{NaHCO}_3(s) + \\text{CH}_3\\text{COOH}(aq) \\rightarrow \\text{CH}_3\\text{COONa}(aq) + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}(l) + \\text{CO}_2(g)$$\nAfter the reaction is complete and the container returns to its initial temperature, the total mass of the assembly is measured again and recorded as $M_2$.\n\nAssuming the container remains perfectly sealed throughout the process, which of the following statements correctly describes the relationship between $M_1$ and $M_2$?\n\nA. $M_2 < M_1$, because a gas ($\\text{CO}_2$) is produced, which is less dense than the initial solid and liquid reactants and thus contributes less to the total mass.\n\nB. $M_2 < M_1$, because the reaction is endothermic, absorbing energy from the surroundings and converting it into mass according to $E=mc^2$.\n\nC. $M_2 > M_1$, because the production of $\\text{CO}_2$ gas increases the pressure inside the container, and this pressure exerts an additional downward force on the balance.\n\nD. $M_2 = M_1$, because the atoms are merely rearranged during the chemical reaction within a closed system, and the total amount of matter is conserved.\n\nE. The relationship between $M_1$ and $M_2$ cannot be determined without knowing if the reaction is exothermic or endothermic, as energy release or absorption will alter the mass.", "solution": "Define the system as the entire rigid, sealed container together with everything inside it (sodium bicarbonate, the inner glass vial, acetic acid solution, any gases inside the container) and the container itself, all placed on the balance. The balance reading is proportional to the net downward force on the balance pan. For a static object in a uniform gravitational field, the support force equals the total weight, so the balance reading corresponds to $Mg$, where $M$ is the total mass of the assembly. Thus, if the total mass of the assembly does not change, then $M_{2}=M_{1}$.\n\nBecause the container remains perfectly sealed, there is no exchange of matter with the surroundings. Therefore this is a closed system with respect to matter. The chemical reaction inside is\n$$\n\\text{NaHCO}_3(s) + \\text{CH}_3\\text{COOH}(aq) \\rightarrow \\text{CH}_3\\text{COONa}(aq) + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}(l) + \\text{CO}_2(g)\n$$\nThis balanced equation conserves the number of atoms of each element. In nonrelativistic chemistry, the law of conservation of mass states that in a closed system, atoms are merely rearranged and the total mass remains constant. Therefore, the sum of the masses of all constituents of the sealed assembly is the same before and after the reaction:\n$$\nM_{2}=M_{1}.\n$$\n\nAddressing the distractors:\n- Option A is incorrect. Density does not set total mass; mass is the sum of the masses of all atoms present. Although $\\text{CO}_2$ is a gas, it remains confined within the sealed container, so no mass leaves the system.\n- Option C is incorrect. The internal gas pressure produces forces on the container’s walls, but these are internal forces within the assembly. Considering the whole assembly as a single body in static equilibrium, Newton’s second law gives that the support force from the balance equals the total weight $Mg$. An increase in internal pressure does not add an extra downward force beyond the weight of the gas, which is already included in $M$.\n- Option B invokes $E=mc^2$ with an incorrect sign and an inapplicable mechanism. If energy were absorbed and retained by the assembly, the mass would increase by $\\Delta m=\\Delta E/c^2$, not decrease. If the reaction is exothermic and the container returns to its initial temperature by exchanging heat with the surroundings, the assembly’s energy content returns to its initial thermal state; any released heat that leaves would change the assembly’s mass by $\\Delta m=-\\Delta E/c^2$, which is utterly negligible on chemical scales and not the operative effect here.\n- Option E is incorrect. The classical conservation of mass for a closed system suffices to conclude $M_{2}=M_{1}$. Any relativistic mass-energy corrections, while real in principle and with sign depending on heat exchange, are negligible for this context and do not overturn the conservation conclusion that applies to the sealed assembly at the stated level.\n\nTherefore, the correct relationship is $M_{2}=M_{1}$ because atoms are rearranged within a closed system and total mass is conserved.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2001722"}, {"introduction": "Beyond a theoretical principle, the law of conservation of mass is a powerful quantitative tool for chemical analysis.
