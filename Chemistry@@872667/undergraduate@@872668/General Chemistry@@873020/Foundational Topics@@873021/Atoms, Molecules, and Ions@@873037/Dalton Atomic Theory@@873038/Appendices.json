Imagine a chemist from that era studying a newly synthesized compound, which they call \"aeride.\" This compound is formed from two recently discovered elements: a gas named Aerogen (A) and a solid named Solidon (S).\n\nThrough meticulous experimentation, the chemist determines the following properties:\n1.  A pure sample of aeride is found to consist of $70.0\\%$ Aerogen and $30.0\\%$ Solidon by mass.\n2.  Separate experiments comparing the masses of individual atoms reveal that a single atom of Aerogen has a mass 3.5 times that of a single atom of Solidon.\n\nBased on the foundational principle that elements combine in simple, whole-number atomic ratios to form compounds, determine the simplest empirical formula for aeride.
