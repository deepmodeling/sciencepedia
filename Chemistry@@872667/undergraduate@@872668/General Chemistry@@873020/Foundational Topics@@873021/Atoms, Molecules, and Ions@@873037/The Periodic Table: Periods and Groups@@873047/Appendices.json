The physical principle is that a large jump indicates removal of an electron from a lower, closed shell (a core electron), which occurs only after all valence electrons have been removed. Therefore, the number of valence electrons of $M$ equals the number of electrons removed before this large jump, namely $2$.\n\nBecause $M$ is a third-period main-group element with two valence electrons, its valence configuration is $3s^{2}$ and it belongs to group $2$.

The formation of this structure from gaseous atoms involves an initial energy cost, the promotion energy $E_{promo}(n)$, to prepare the atom for four-valent bonding. This is followed by an energy release from the formation of four bonds, characterized by the average bond energy $E_{bond}(n)$.
