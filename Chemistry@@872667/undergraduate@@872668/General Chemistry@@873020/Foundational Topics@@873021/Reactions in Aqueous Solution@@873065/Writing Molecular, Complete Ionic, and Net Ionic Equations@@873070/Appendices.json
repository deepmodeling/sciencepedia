We can balance this redox reaction using the half-reaction method.\n\nThe reduction half-reaction involves chromium. The oxidation state of Cr in $Cr_2O_7^{2-}$ is +6, and it is reduced to +3 in $Cr^{3+}$.\n$$Cr_2O_7^{2-}(aq) \\rightarrow Cr^{3+}(aq)$$\nFirst, we balance the chromium atoms:\n$$Cr_2O_7^{2-}(aq) \\rightarrow 2Cr^{3+}(aq)$$\nNext, we balance the oxygen atoms by adding water molecules:\n$$Cr_2O_7^{2-}(aq) \\rightarrow 2Cr^{3+}(aq) + 7H_2O(l)$$\nThen, we balance the hydrogen atoms by adding protons ($H^+$), as the solution is acidic:\n$$14H^+(aq) + Cr_2O_7^{2-}(aq) \\rightarrow 2Cr^{3+}(aq) + 7H_2O(l)$$\nFinally, we balance the charge by adding electrons ($e^-$).
