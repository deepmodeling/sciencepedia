This practice [@problem_id:2007801] simulates such a scenario, where you must use the known oxidation state of a metal cation and the charge of a polyatomic anion to construct the correct chemical formula. This requires mastering the principle of charge neutrality to determine the proper ratio of ions, a critical step in finalizing the compound's systematic name.", "problem": "A quality control chemist at an industrial synthesis plant receives a shipment of a crystalline solid labeled simply as 'manganese sulfate'. Elemental analysis confirms the presence of manganese and sulfate ions. However, further spectroscopic analysis reveals that the manganese in the compound is exclusively in the +3 oxidation state. The sulfate ion is the standard polyatomic ion, with the formula $\\text{SO}_4^{2-}$. To update the inventory with a precise and unambiguous record, the chemist must determine the correct chemical formula and the systematic name for this compound according to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) nomenclature rules.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly identifies both the chemical formula and the systematic name for the compound?\n\nA.

Formula: $\\text{Mn(SO}_4)_3$; Name: Manganic sulfate", "solution": "The problem asks for the correct chemical formula and systematic name for an ionic compound formed from manganese in the +3 oxidation state and the sulfate ion.\n\nFirst, we identify the constituent ions and their charges.\nThe cation is the manganese ion. The problem explicitly states that its oxidation state is +3. Therefore, the cation is $\\text{Mn}^{3+}$.\nThe anion is the sulfate ion, which is given as $\\text{SO}_4^{2-}$.\n\nNext, we determine the chemical formula. Ionic compounds must be electrically neutral, meaning the total positive charge from the cations must balance the total negative charge from the anions. We need to find the simplest whole-number ratio of cations to anions that achieves this neutrality.\n\nLet the formula be $\\text{Mn}_x(\\text{SO}_4)_y$, where $x$ and $y$ are the subscripts representing the number of each ion.\nThe total positive charge is $x \\times (+3)$.\nThe total negative charge is $y \\times (-2)$.\nFor neutrality, we must have:\n$x(+3) + y(-2) = 0$\n$3x = 2y$\n\nThe simplest whole-number solution for this equation is to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the magnitudes of the charges, which are 3 and 2. The LCM of 3 and 2 is 6.\nTo achieve a total positive charge of +6, we need $x = 2$ (since $2 \\times 3 = 6$).\nTo achieve a total negative charge of -6, we need $y = 3$ (since $3 \\times -2 = -6$).\nThus, the ratio of $\\text{Mn}^{3+}$ ions to $\\text{SO}_4^{2-}$ ions is 2:3.\nThe chemical formula is therefore $\\text{Mn}_2(\\text{SO}_4)_3$. The parentheses around $\\text{SO}_4$ are necessary to indicate that the subscript 3 applies to the entire polyatomic sulfate ion.\n\nNow, we determine the systematic name. For ionic compounds containing a metal that can exhibit more than one oxidation state (like most transition metals, including manganese), the Stock System of nomenclature is used. This system specifies the oxidation state of the metal cation using a Roman numeral in parentheses immediately following the metal's name.\n\nThe components of the name are:\n1. The name of the cation: Manganese\n2. The oxidation state of the cation in Roman numerals: The problem states it is +3, so we use (III).\n3. The name of the anion: The anion is $\\text{SO}_4^{2-}$, which is named sulfate.\n\nCombining these parts, the systematic name is Manganese(III) sulfate.\n\nFinally, we compare our derived formula and name with the given options.\n- Formula: $\\text{Mn}_2(\\text{SO}_4)_3$\n- Name: Manganese(III) sulfate\n\nThis matches option B. Let's analyze the other options to confirm they are incorrect:\n- A: $\\text{MnSO}_4$, Manganese(II) sulfate. This would be the compound if manganese had a +2 oxidation state.\n- C: $\\text{MnSO}_4$, Manganese(III) sulfate. The formula is incorrect for the given name; it is not charge-balanced for $\\text{Mn}^{3+}$.\n- D: $\\text{Mn}_2(\\text{SO}_4)_3$, Manganese sulfate. The formula is correct, but the name is ambiguous because it omits the Roman numeral required for manganese.\n- E: $\\text{Mn(SO}_4)_3$, Manganic sulfate. The formula is incorrect as it would imply a charge of -1 for each sulfate ion to balance one $\\text{Mn}^{3+}$ ion. The name uses an older, less systematic nomenclature.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2007801"}]}
