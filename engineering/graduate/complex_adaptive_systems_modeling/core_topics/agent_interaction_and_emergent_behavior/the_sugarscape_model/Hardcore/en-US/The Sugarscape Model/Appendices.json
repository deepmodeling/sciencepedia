The agent follows the standard Epstein–Axtell movement rule: in each time step, it surveys cells along the four cardinal directions (North, East, South, West) up to its vision $v$, subject to grid boundaries and occupancy constraints, and chooses the destination cell that maximizes the sugar value. Ties are broken by choosing the destination with minimal Manhattan distance from the origin, and if still tied, by a fixed direction priority ordering East $\\succ$ South $\\succ$ West $\\succ$ North $\\succ$ stay.

The standard formula is $G = 1 - 2 \\int_0^1 L(p) \\, dp$. The Lorenz curve $L(p)$ represents the cumulative proportion of total wealth held by the bottom $p$ proportion of the population. It is defined as $L(p) = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\int_{s_{\\min}}^{s(p)} s' f(s') \\, ds'$, where $\\mu$ is the mean of the distribution, $f(s')$ is the probability density function (PDF), $s_{\\min}$ is the minimum value of the variable, and $s(p)$ is the quantile function (the inverse of the cumulative distribution function, CDF).\n\nThe derivation proceeds in four steps:\n1.

A smaller $\\alpha$ (closer to $1$) implies a \"heavier\" or \"fatter\" tail in the distribution, leading to a higher Gini coefficient and thus greater initial inequality. Conversely, a larger $\\alpha$ implies a \"thinner\" tail, a more homogeneous population, and lower initial inequality.\n\nIn the context of the Sugarscape model, this initial condition critically shapes the system's dynamics, particularly in the early transient phase, under standard rules (movement to richest location, harvesting, metabolic cost, and death upon wealth depletion).\n\n-   **Case 1: Low $\\alpha$ (High Initial Inequality)**\n    When $\\alpha$ is small (e.g., $\\alpha=1.1$), the initial Gini coefficient is high (e.g., $G = 1/(2.2-1) \\approx 0.83$). The population consists of a large number of poor agents with endowments near $s_{\\min}$ and a very small number of extremely wealthy agents. The early dynamics are characterized by strong selective pressure. The numerous poor agents are highly vulnerable; they must quickly find sugar on the landscape to offset their metabolic costs. Many will fail and die off rapidly. This mass die-off of the poorest individuals removes the lower end of the wealth distribution. Counter-intuitively, this can cause the Gini coefficient of the *surviving* population to decrease in the initial phase, as the extreme poverty is eliminated through agent death. The system's evolution is dominated by this initial culling process.\n\n-   **Case 2: High $\\alpha$ (Low Initial Inequality)**\n    When $\\alpha$ is large (e.g., $\\alpha=5$), the initial Gini coefficient is low (e.g., $G = 1/(10-1) \\approx 0.11$). The initial endowments are more tightly clustered. Most agents start with a comparable amount of sugar, and there are very few extremely rich or poor individuals. In this scenario, nearly all agents have a sufficient buffer to survive the first several steps. The early dynamics are not dominated by immediate survival, but rather by the process of wealth differentiation. Inequality emerges and grows over time due to a combination of environmental heterogeneity (the non-uniform distribution of sugar on the landscape) and luck (stochastic elements or simply being in the right place at the right time). Agents who happen upon rich sugar patches will accumulate wealth, while others in barren regions will see their wealth slowly decline due to metabolism. Therefore, the Gini coefficient is expected to rise from its low initial value, a classic example of emergent inequality from a relatively homogeneous state.\n\nIn summary, the parameter $\\alpha$ acts as a crucial control parameter that determines the nature of inequality dynamics in the Sugarscape. Low $\\alpha$ triggers a dynamic driven by initial selection and the elimination of poverty, while high $\\alpha$ triggers a dynamic driven by path-dependence and the emergence of wealth from near-equality.",
