This practice explores this fundamental issue by asking you to derive how a standard null model, the configuration model, predicts feed-forward loop counts based on node degrees .

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution proceeds in three stages: first, a principled justification for the inflation of motif counts; second, a detailed analysis of the given network to determine its properties and identify all FFLs; and third, the computation of the normalized score $S$.\n\n**Part 1: Justification of Raw Count Inflation**\n\nThe feed-forward loop (FFL) on distinct nodes $(i,j,k)$ consists of the edges $i \\rightarrow j$, $j \\rightarrow k$, and $i \\rightarrow k$. In the specified Chung-Lu baseline model, the occurrence of each potential edge is an independent probabilistic event. The probability of an edge from a node $u$ to a node $v$ is given by $p_{uv} = \\frac{k_{u}^{\\mathrm{out}} k_{v}^{\\mathrm{in}}}{m}$.\n\nThe expected number of FFLs, $N_{\\mathrm{FFL}}^{\\mathrm{exp}}$, in a random network generated by this model is the sum, over all distinct triples of nodes $(i,j,k)$, of the probability that this triple forms an FFL. Due to the independence assumption, this probability is the product of the individual edge probabilities:\n$$P(\\text{FFL on } i,j,k) = p_{ij} p_{jk} p_{ik}$$\nSubstituting the given baseline probability formula:\n$$P(\\text{FFL on } i,j,k) = \\left(\\frac{k_{i}^{\\mathrm{out}} k_{j}^{\\mathrm{in}}}{m}\\right) \\left(\\frac{k_{j}^{\\mathrm{out}} k_{k}^{\\mathrm{in}}}{m}\\right) \\left(\\frac{k_{i}^{\\mathrm{out}} k_{k}^{\\mathrm{in}}}{m}\\right) = \\frac{(k_{i}^{\\mathrm{out}})^{2} k_{j}^{\\mathrm{in}} k_{j}^{\\mathrm{out}} (k_{k}^{\\mathrm{in}})^{2}}{m^{3}}$$\nThe total expected number of FFLs is the sum of these probabilities over all possible triples:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{FFL}}^{\\mathrm{exp}} = \\sum_{i \\neq j \\neq k \\neq i} \\frac{(k_{i}^{\\mathrm{out}})^{2} k_{j}^{\\mathrm{in}} k_{j}^{\\mathrm{out}} (k_{k}^{\\mathrm{in}})^{2}}{m^{3}}$$\nThis expression demonstrates from first principles that the expected number of FFLs is not uniform across all network structures but is highly dependent on the degree sequence. Specifically, the contribution of any potential FFL involving nodes $i, j, k$ to the expected count scales with the square of the out-degree of the source node $i$, the square of the in-degree of the sink node $k$, and the product of the in- and out-degrees of the intermediate node $j$. Consequently, nodes with large degrees (hubs) disproportionately increase the expected number of FFLs. A raw count of FFLs in an observed network is therefore \"inflated\" by the presence of high-degree nodes, as this baseline expectation is high regardless of any higher-order structural organization. Normalization is required to disentangle the contribution of the degree sequence from true structural over-representation.\n\n**Part 2: Network Analysis and FFL Identification**\n\nThe given network has $5$ nodes $\\{a,b,c,d,e\\}$ and $10$ edges. The total number of edges is $m=10$. We first compute the in-degrees ($k^{\\mathrm{in}}$) and out-degrees ($k^{\\mathrm{out}}$) for each node.\n- Node $a$: $k_{a}^{\\mathrm{in}} = 0$, $k_{a}^{\\mathrm{out}} = 4$\n- Node $b$: $k_{b}^{\\mathrm{in}} = 1$, $k_{b}^{\\mathrm{out}} = 3$\n- Node $c$: $k_{c}^{\\mathrm{in}} = 2$, $k_{c}^{\\mathrm{out}} = 2$\n- Node $d$: $k_{d}^{\\mathrm{in}} = 3$, $k_{d}^{\\mathrm{out}} = 1$\n- Node $e$: $k_{e}^{\\mathrm{in}} = 4$, $k_{e}^{\\mathrm{out}} = 0$\nThe sums of degrees are $\\sum k^{\\mathrm{in}} = 10$ and $\\sum k^{\\mathrm{out}} = 10$, consistent with $m=10$.\n\nNext, we systematically identify all FFLs $(i,j,k)$ in the network. An FFL requires a path of length two ($i \\rightarrow j \\rightarrow k$) and a direct \"shortcut\" edge ($i \\rightarrow k$).\n1. FFL $(a,b,c)$: Path $a \\rightarrow b \\rightarrow c$ exists. Shortcut $a \\rightarrow c$ exists.\n2. FFL $(a,b,d)$: Path $a \\rightarrow b \\rightarrow d$ exists. Shortcut $a \\rightarrow d$ exists.\n3. FFL $(a,b,e)$: Path $a \\rightarrow b \\rightarrow e$ exists. Shortcut $a \\rightarrow e$ exists.\n4. FFL $(a,c,d)$: Path $a \\rightarrow c \\rightarrow d$ exists. Shortcut $a \\rightarrow d$ exists.\n5. FFL $(a,c,e)$: Path $a \\rightarrow c \\rightarrow e$ exists. Shortcut $a \\rightarrow e$ exists.\n6. FFL $(a,d,e)$: Path $a \\rightarrow d \\rightarrow e$ exists. Shortcut $a \\rightarrow e$ exists.\n7. FFL $(b,c,d)$: Path $b \\rightarrow c \\rightarrow d$ exists. Shortcut $b \\rightarrow d$ exists.\n8. FFL $(b,c,e)$: Path $b \\rightarrow c \\rightarrow e$ exists. Shortcut $b \\rightarrow e$ exists.\n9. FFL $(b,d,e)$: Path $b \\rightarrow d \\rightarrow e$ exists. Shortcut $b \\rightarrow e$ exists.\n10. FFL $(c,d,e)$: Path $c \\rightarrow d \\rightarrow e$ exists. Shortcut $c \\rightarrow e$ exists.\nThere are a total of $10$ FFLs in the network.\n\n**Part 3: Computation of the Normalized Score S**\n\nThe normalized score $S$ is the sum of weights for all observed FFLs. The weight $w_{ijk}$ for an FFL on nodes $(i,j,k)$ is the inverse of the product of the baseline probabilities of its constituent edges:\n$$w_{ijk} = \\frac{1}{p_{ij} p_{jk} p_{ik}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{(k_{i}^{\\mathrm{out}})^{2} k_{j}^{\\mathrm{in}} k_{j}^{\\mathrm{out}} (k_{k}^{\\mathrm{in}})^{2}}{m^{3}}} = \\frac{m^{3}}{(k_{i}^{\\mathrm{out}})^{2} k_{j}^{\\mathrm{in}} k_{j}^{\\mathrm{out}} (k_{k}^{\\mathrm{in}})^{2}}$$\nWe compute this weight for each of the $10$ identified FFLs, using $m=10$ (so $m^3=1000$) and the degree values calculated earlier.\n\n- $w_{abc} = \\frac{1000}{(k_{a}^{\\mathrm{out}})^{2} k_{b}^{\\mathrm{in}} k_{b}^{\\mathrm{out}} (k_{c}^{\\mathrm{in}})^{2}} = \\frac{1000}{(4)^{2}(1)(3)(2)^{2}} = \\frac{1000}{192}$\n- $w_{abd} = \\frac{1000}{(k_{a}^{\\mathrm{out}})^{2} k_{b}^{\\mathrm{in}} k_{b}^{\\mathrm{out}} (k_{d}^{\\mathrm{in}})^{2}} = \\frac{1000}{(4)^{2}(1)(3)(3)^{2}} = \\frac{1000}{432}$\n- $w_{abe} = \\frac{1000}{(k_{a}^{\\mathrm{out}})^{2} k_{b}^{\\mathrm{in}} k_{b}^{\\mathrm{out}} (k_{e}^{\\mathrm{in}})^{2}} = \\frac{1000}{(4)^{2}(1)(3)(4)^{2}} = \\frac{1000}{768}$\n- $w_{acd} = \\frac{1000}{(k_{a}^{\\mathrm{out}})^{2} k_{c}^{\\mathrm{in}} k_{c}^{\\mathrm{out}} (k_{d}^{\\mathrm{in}})^{2}} = \\frac{1000}{(4)^{2}(2)(2)(3)^{2}} = \\frac{1000}{576}$\n- $w_{ace} = \\frac{1000}{(k_{a}^{\\mathrm{out}})^{2} k_{c}^{\\mathrm{in}} k_{c}^{\\mathrm{out}} (k_{e}^{\\mathrm{in}})^{2}} = \\frac{1000}{(4)^{2}(2)(2)(4)^{2}} = \\frac{1000}{1024}$\n- $w_{ade} = \\frac{1000}{(k_{a}^{\\mathrm{out}})^{2} k_{d}^{\\mathrm{in}} k_{d}^{\\mathrm{out}} (k_{e}^{\\mathrm{in}})^{2}} = \\frac{1000}{(4)^{2}(3)(1)(4)^{2}} = \\frac{1000}{768}$\n- $w_{bcd} = \\frac{1000}{(k_{b}^{\\mathrm{out}})^{2} k_{c}^{\\mathrm{in}} k_{c}^{\\mathrm{out}} (k_{d}^{\\mathrm{in}})^{2}} = \\frac{1000}{(3)^{2}(2)(2)(3)^{2}} = \\frac{1000}{324}$\n- $w_{bce} = \\frac{1000}{(k_{b}^{\\mathrm{out}})^{2} k_{c}^{\\mathrm{in}} k_{c}^{\\mathrm{out}} (k_{e}^{\\mathrm{in}})^{2}} = \\frac{1000}{(3)^{2}(2)(2)(4)^{2}} = \\frac{1000}{576}$\n- $w_{bde} = \\frac{1000}{(k_{b}^{\\mathrm{out}})^{2} k_{d}^{\\mathrm{in}} k_{d}^{\\mathrm{out}} (k_{e}^{\\mathrm{in}})^{2}} = \\frac{1000}{(3)^{2}(3)(1)(4)^{2}} = \\frac{1000}{432}$\n- $w_{cde} = \\frac{1000}{(k_{c}^{\\mathrm{out}})^{2} k_{d}^{\\mathrm{in}} k_{d}^{\\mathrm{out}} (k_{e}^{\\mathrm{in}})^{2}} = \\frac{1000}{(2)^{2}(3)(1)(4)^{2}} = \\frac{1000}{192}$\n\nThe total score $S$ is the sum of these $10$ weights:\n$$S = \\frac{1000}{192} + \\frac{1000}{432} + \\frac{1000}{768} + \\frac{1000}{576} + \\frac{1000}{1024} + \\frac{1000}{768} + \\frac{1000}{324} + \\frac{1000}{576} + \\frac{1000}{432} + \\frac{1000}{192}$$\nGrouping terms with identical denominators:\n$$S = 1000 \\left( \\frac{2}{192} + \\frac{2}{432} + \\frac{2}{768} + \\frac{2}{576} + \\frac{1}{1024} + \\frac{1}{324} \\right)$$\n$$S = 1000 \\left( \\frac{1}{96} + \\frac{1}{216} + \\frac{1}{384} + \\frac{1}{288} + \\frac{1}{1024} + \\frac{1}{324} \\right)$$\nTo sum these fractions, we find the least common multiple of the denominators:\n$96 = 2^5 \\times 3^1$, $216 = 2^3 \\times 3^3$, $384 = 2^7 \\times 3^1$, $288 = 2^5 \\times 3^2$, $1024 = 2^{10}$, $324 = 2^2 \\times 3^4$.\nThe LCM is $2^{10} \\times 3^4 = 1024 \\times 81 = 82944$.\nExpressing each fraction with this common denominator:\n$$S = 1000 \\left( \\frac{864}{82944} + \\frac{384}{82944} + \\frac{216}{82944} + \\frac{288}{82944} + \\frac{81}{82944} + \\frac{256}{82944} \\right)$$\n$$S = 1000 \\left( \\frac{864+384+216+288+81+256}{82944} \\right) = 1000 \\left( \\frac{2089}{82944} \\right)$$\n$$S = \\frac{2089000}{82944}$$\nThe fraction simplifies by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, 8.\n$$S = \\frac{2089000 \\div 8}{82944 \\div 8} = \\frac{261125}{10368}$$\nThis is the exact value of the normalized motif score.",

            "introduction": "Beyond their statistical over-representation, network motifs are considered building blocks of complex systems because their structure dictates their function. This practice takes you into the heart of systems biology by modeling the dynamic behavior of the Coherent Type-1 Feed-Forward Loop (C1-FFL), a ubiquitous motif in gene regulation . By deriving and solving the differential equations that govern this circuit, you will analytically demonstrate how its specific topology creates a sign-sensitive delay, allowing it to act as a persistence detector that filters out noisy or brief signals.",

            "problem": "Consider a gene regulatory network motif known as the coherent Type-1 feed-forward loop (C1-FFL), in which a transcription factor $X$ activates an intermediate gene product $Y$, and both $X$ and $Y$ positively regulate a downstream gene product $Z$. In systems biomedicine, such motifs are modeled using first-order production and degradation kinetics and Hill-type input-output relationships for transcriptional activation. A standard activation Hill function for an input $U$ acting on a target is defined as $f(U) = \\dfrac{U^{n}}{K^{n} + U^{n}}$, where $n$ is the Hill coefficient and $K$ is the activation constant. Assume negligible basal expression when the activating input is absent.\n\nStarting from these core definitions:\n\n1) Derive ordinary differential equations for $Y$ and $Z$ consistent with first-order degradation and Hill-type activation by $X$ and $Y$, under the assumption that $Z$ implements an AND logic gate for its two inputs. Use symbols $\\alpha_Y$, $\\alpha_Z$ for maximal production rates, $\\beta_Y$, $\\beta_Z$ for degradation rates, and independent Hill functions $f_X(X)$, $g_X(X)$, and $h_Y(Y)$ for the regulatory effects of $X$ on $Y$, $X$ on $Z$, and $Y$ on $Z$, respectively.\n\n2) To analyze sign-sensitive delays, consider the following protocol and parameter regime:\n- Hill coefficients are $n=1$ for all regulatory links.\n- The input $X(t)$ is a step: $X(t) = 0$ for $t<0$ and $X(t) = X_{0}$ for $t \\ge 0$.\n- Initial conditions are $Y(0)=0$ and $Z(0)=0$.\n- The AND gate at $Z$ is implemented by the product $g_X(X)\\,h_Y(Y)$.\n- The production term $h_Y(Y)$ is in the weak activation regime for $Y$, namely $Y(t) \\ll K_{Y}$, so that $h_Y(Y) \\approx \\dfrac{Y}{K_{Y}}$.\n- Degradation rates of $Y$ and $Z$ are equal: $\\beta_Y = \\beta_Z = \\beta > 0$.\n- There is no production when $X=0$, i.e., $f_X(0)=0$ and $g_X(0)=0$.\n\nUnder these assumptions:\n(a) Derive $Z(t)$ for $t \\ge 0$ when $X$ is stepped from $0$ to $X_{0}$ and held constant.\n(b) Define the dimensionless ON half-time $\\theta_{\\mathrm{on}} = \\beta\\,t_{\\mathrm{on}}$, where $t_{\\mathrm{on}}$ is the time after $t=0$ at which $Z(t)$ first reaches one-half of its steady-state level for constant $X_{0}$, and solve for $\\theta_{\\mathrm{on}}$ in closed form.\n(c) Suppose the system has reached steady state under $X=X_{0}$ and then, at a later time $t=T_{\\mathrm{off}}$, $X$ is switched instantaneously to $0$. Define the dimensionless OFF half-time $\\theta_{\\mathrm{off}} = \\beta\\,(t_{\\mathrm{off}}-T_{\\mathrm{off}})$ as the time after shutoff needed for $Z$ to decay to one-half of its previous steady-state level, and solve for $\\theta_{\\mathrm{off}}$ in closed form.\n(d) Using parts (b) and (c), compute the dimensionless delay difference $\\Delta \\theta = \\theta_{\\mathrm{on}} - \\theta_{\\mathrm{off}}$ as a single closed-form analytic expression.\n\nExplain in your derivation why the AND logic together with negligible basal activity and the temporal ordering of $X \\to Y \\to Z$ produces a sign-sensitive delay (slow ON, fast OFF) for this motif. The final answer must be only the expression for $\\Delta \\theta$. No numerical evaluation is required, and no units should be included in the final answer.",
            "solution": "The user-provided problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of biochemical kinetics and systems biology, is well-posed with a clear and complete set of definitions and constraints, and is expressed in objective, formalizable language.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)\n\nThe dynamics of the concentrations of gene products $Y$ and $Z$ are modeled by first-order ordinary differential equations that balance production and degradation.\n\nThe rate of change of the concentration of $Y$, denoted as $[Y]$, is given by its production rate activated by $X$ minus its first-order degradation. The activation is described by the Hill function $f_X(X)$, and the maximal production rate is $\\alpha_Y$. The degradation rate is $\\beta_Y$. Thus, the ODE for $Y$ is:\n$$ \\frac{d[Y]}{dt} = \\alpha_Y f_X([X]) - \\beta_Y [Y] $$\nFor simplicity, we will denote the concentrations $[X]$, $[Y]$, and $[Z]$ as $X$, $Y$, and $Z$.\n$$ \\frac{dY}{dt} = \\alpha_Y f_X(X) - \\beta_Y Y $$\n\nThe production of $Z$ is co-activated by $X$ and $Y$. The problem states that this regulation implements an AND logic gate, which is modeled as the product of the individual Hill functions $g_X(X)$ and $h_Y(Y)$. The maximal production rate for $Z$ is $\\alpha_Z$, and its degradation rate is $\\beta_Z$. The ODE for $Z$ is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{dZ}{dt} = \\alpha_Z g_X(X) h_Y(Y) - \\beta_Z Z $$\n\n### Part 2: Analysis of Sign-Sensitive Delay\n\nWe now apply the specific assumptions provided for the analysis.\n\n#### (a) Derivation of $Z(t)$ for the ON-response\n\nThe assumptions are:\n- Hill coefficient $n=1$, so the Hill function is $f(U) = \\frac{U}{K+U}$.\n- Input $X(t) = X_0$ for $t \\ge 0$.\n- Initial conditions $Y(0)=0$ and $Z(0)=0$.\n- AND gate production term is $\\alpha_Z g_X(X) h_Y(Y)$.\n- Weak activation by $Y$: $Y(t) \\ll K_Y$, so $h_Y(Y) = \\frac{Y}{K_Y+Y} \\approx \\frac{Y}{K_Y}$.\n- Equal degradation rates: $\\beta_Y = \\beta_Z = \\beta > 0$.\n\nFirst, we solve for $Y(t)$. The ODE for $Y$ becomes:\n$$ \\frac{dY}{dt} = \\alpha_Y \\frac{X_0}{K_X + X_0} - \\beta Y $$\nwhere $K_X$ is the activation constant for the $X \\to Y$ link.\nThis is a linear first-order ODE. Let the constant production term be $S_Y = \\alpha_Y \\frac{X_0}{K_X + X_0}$. The equation is $\\frac{dY}{dt} + \\beta Y = S_Y$. The solution with the initial condition $Y(0)=0$ is:\n$$ Y(t) = \\frac{S_Y}{\\beta} (1 - \\exp(-\\beta t)) = Y_{ss} (1 - \\exp(-\\beta t)) $$\nwhere $Y_{ss} = S_Y/\\beta$ is the steady-state concentration of $Y$.\n\nNext, we solve for $Z(t)$. The ODE for $Z$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dZ}{dt} = \\alpha_Z \\left( \\frac{X_0}{K'_X + X_0} \\right) \\left( \\frac{Y(t)}{K_Y} \\right) - \\beta Z $$\nwhere $K'_X$ and $K_Y$ are the activation constants for the $X \\to Z$ and $Y \\to Z$ links, respectively. Let the constant terms be grouped into a single production constant $S_Z = \\frac{\\alpha_Z}{K_Y} \\frac{X_0}{K'_X+X_0}$.\nThe ODE becomes:\n$$ \\frac{dZ}{dt} + \\beta Z = S_Z Y(t) = S_Z Y_{ss} (1 - \\exp(-\\beta t)) $$\nThis is a linear first-order non-homogeneous ODE. We solve it using an integrating factor, $\\mu(t) = \\exp(\\int \\beta dt) = \\exp(\\beta t)$.\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}(Z \\exp(\\beta t)) = S_Z Y_{ss} (1 - \\exp(-\\beta t)) \\exp(\\beta t) = S_Z Y_{ss} (\\exp(\\beta t) - 1) $$\nIntegrating from $0$ to $t$:\n$$ Z(t)\\exp(\\beta t) - Z(0)\\exp(0) = \\int_0^t S_Z Y_{ss} (\\exp(\\beta \\tau) - 1) d\\tau $$\nUsing $Z(0)=0$:\n$$ Z(t)\\exp(\\beta t) = S_Z Y_{ss} \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\exp(\\beta \\tau) - \\tau \\right]_0^t = S_Z Y_{ss} \\left( (\\frac{1}{\\beta}\\exp(\\beta t) - t) - (\\frac{1}{\\beta} - 0) \\right) $$\n$$ Z(t) = S_Z Y_{ss} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\beta} - t \\exp(-\\beta t) - \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\exp(-\\beta t) \\right) $$\nThe steady-state value of $Z$ is $Z_{ss} = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} Z(t) = \\frac{S_Z Y_{ss}}{\\beta}$.\nSubstituting this back, we get the expression for $Z(t)$:\n$$ Z(t) = Z_{ss} (1 - \\exp(-\\beta t) - \\beta t \\exp(-\\beta t)) $$\n\n#### (b) Derivation of the dimensionless ON half-time, $\\theta_{\\mathrm{on}}$\n\nThe ON half-time, $t_{\\mathrm{on}}$, is the time at which $Z(t_{\\mathrm{on}}) = \\frac{1}{2}Z_{ss}$.\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} Z_{ss} = Z_{ss} (1 - \\exp(-\\beta t_{\\mathrm{on}}) - \\beta t_{\\mathrm{on}} \\exp(-\\beta t_{\\mathrm{on}})) $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} = 1 - (1 + \\beta t_{\\mathrm{on}}) \\exp(-\\beta t_{\\mathrm{on}}) $$\n$$ (1 + \\beta t_{\\mathrm{on}}) \\exp(-\\beta t_{\\mathrm{on}}) = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nLet $\\theta_{\\mathrm{on}} = \\beta t_{\\mathrm{on}}$. The equation becomes:\n$$ (1 + \\theta_{\\mathrm{on}}) \\exp(-\\theta_{\\mathrm{on}}) = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThis is a transcendental equation whose solution can be expressed using the Lambert W function, $W(z)$, which is defined as the solution to $z = W(z) \\exp(W(z))$. To transform our equation into this form, let $u = -(1 + \\theta_{\\mathrm{on}})$. Then $\\theta_{\\mathrm{on}} = -u-1$.\n$$ (-u) \\exp(-(-u-1)) = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies -u \\exp(u+1) = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies u \\exp(u) = -\\frac{1}{2e} $$\nThe solution is $u = W_k(-\\frac{1}{2e})$, where $k$ is the branch index. Since $\\theta_{\\mathrm{on}} = \\beta t_{\\mathrm{on}}$ must be a positive real number, we require $\\theta_{\\mathrm{on}} = -u-1 > 0$, which implies $u < -1$. The argument $-\\frac{1}{2e}$ is in the interval $[-\\frac{1}{e}, 0)$, for which two real branches of the Lambert W function exist, $W_0$ and $W_{-1}$. The range of the principal branch $W_0$ is $[-1, \\infty)$, while the range of the $W_{-1}$ branch is $(-\\infty, -1]$. To satisfy $u < -1$, we must choose the $k=-1$ branch.\n$$ u = W_{-1}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2e}\\right) $$\nTherefore, the dimensionless ON half-time is:\n$$ \\theta_{\\mathrm{on}} = -1 - u = -1 - W_{-1}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2e}\\right) $$\n\n#### (c) Derivation of the dimensionless OFF half-time, $\\theta_{\\mathrm{off}}$\n\nFor the OFF-response, the system starts at steady-state ($Y(T_{\\mathrm{off}}) = Y_{ss}$, $Z(T_{\\mathrm{off}})=Z_{ss}$) and at time $t=T_{\\mathrm{off}}$, the input is switched to $X=0$. Since $f_X(0)=0$ and $g_X(0)=0$, all production ceases. The ODE for $Z$ for time $t' = t - T_{\\mathrm{off}} \\ge 0$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dZ}{dt'} = -\\beta Z $$\nwith the initial condition $Z(t'=0) = Z_{ss}$. The solution is simple exponential decay:\n$$ Z(t') = Z_{ss} \\exp(-\\beta t') $$\nThe OFF half-time, $t'_{\\mathrm{off}} = t_{\\mathrm{off}} - T_{\\mathrm{off}}$, is the time at which $Z(t'_{\\mathrm{off}}) = \\frac{1}{2}Z_{ss}$.\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} Z_{ss} = Z_{ss} \\exp(-\\beta t'_{\\mathrm{off}}) $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-\\beta t'_{\\mathrm{off}}) $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\beta t'_{\\mathrm{off}} \\implies -\\ln(2) = -\\beta t'_{\\mathrm{off}} $$\nThe dimensionless OFF half-time is $\\theta_{\\mathrm{off}} = \\beta t'_{\\mathrm{off}}$, which gives:\n$$ \\theta_{\\mathrm{off}} = \\ln(2) $$\n\n#### (d) Computation of the dimensionless delay difference, $\\Delta\\theta$\n\nThe dimensionless delay difference is $\\Delta\\theta = \\theta_{\\mathrm{on}} - \\theta_{\\mathrm{off}}$.\n$$ \\Delta\\theta = \\left(-1 - W_{-1}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2e}\\right)\\right) - \\ln(2) $$\n\n### Explanation of Sign-Sensitive Delay\n\nThe C1-FFL with AND logic inherently produces a sign-sensitive delay, characterized by a slow ON-response and a fast OFF-response.\nThe **fast OFF-response** occurs because the production of $Z$ requires both $X$ and $Y$ to be present. When the input signal $X$ is switched OFF, the production term for $Z$, $\\alpha_Z g_X(X) h_Y(Y)$, immediately drops to zero because $g_X(0)=0$. The concentration of $Z$ then decays exponentially with a rate constant $\\beta$, which is a rapid process. The system does not need to wait for $Y$ to decay; the shutoff is gated directly by $X$.\nThe **slow ON-response** is due to the delay in the accumulation of the intermediate, $Y$. When $X$ is switched ON, the production of $Z$ cannot begin at its maximal rate immediately. Although the input from the $X \\to Z$ path is present, the input from the $Y \\to Z$ path is initially zero ($Y(0)=0$). $Z$ production only builds up as $Y$ itself is produced and accumulates. This two-step activation cascade ($X \\to Y$ and $(X,Y) \\to Z$) creates a lag. Mathematically, this lag is evident because the time derivative of $Z$ at $t=0$ is zero: $\\frac{dZ}{dt}|_{t=0} = S_Z Y(0) - \\beta Z(0) = 0$. This contrasts with a simple single-input system, where the initial rate of production would be maximal. The resulting response curve for $Z(t)$ is sigmoidal, reflecting the initial lag phase before a faster rise. This mechanism allows the motif to function as a *persistence detector*, filtering out brief input pulses that are not long enough for $Y$ to accumulate sufficiently.\nThe difference, $\\Delta \\theta$, quantifies this asymmetry in response times. Since $\\theta_{\\mathrm{on}} \\approx 1.153$ (from numerical evaluation of the symbolic result) and $\\theta_{\\mathrm{off}} = \\ln(2) \\approx 0.693$, the ON-time is significantly longer than the OFF-time.",
