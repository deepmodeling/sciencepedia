There are $N$ nodes placed on a ring with periodic boundary conditions, labeled by integers modulo $N$. Each node is connected to its $m$ nearest neighbors on each side, for a total degree $2m$, with $1 \\leq m$ and $N \\geq 2m+1$ to avoid degeneracies. A triangle is defined as an unordered triple of distinct nodes $\\{i,j,k\\}$ such that all three pairs $\\{i,j\\}$, $\\{j,k\\}$, and $\\{k,i\\}$ are edges.

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the total number of triangles, $T_{\\text{tot}}$, in a specific type of regular graph. The graph is generated by the Watts-Strogatz model with a rewiring probability of $p=0$. This constructs a regular ring lattice.\n\nFirst, we formalize the structure of the graph based on the provided definitions. The set of nodes is $V = \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$, representing $N$ nodes on a ring with periodic boundary conditions. An edge exists between two distinct nodes $i$ and $j$ if each is among the $m$ nearest neighbors of the other. The distance measure is the graph-theoretic distance on the ring, $d(i,j) = \\min\\{|i-j|, N - |i-j|\\}$. Thus, an edge $(i,j)$ exists if and only if $1 \\le d(i,j) \\le m$. The degree of every node is constant, $k=2m$, due to the regular structure. The constraint $N \\ge 2m+1$ ensures that for any node, its $m$ nearest neighbors on the \"left\" and $m$ on the \"right\" are all distinct from each other and from the node itself.\n\nA triangle is an unordered set of three distinct nodes $\\{i,j,k\\}$ where all three pairs are connected by edges. The total number of triangles $T_{\\text{tot}}$ can be found by summing the number of triangles associated with each node and dividing by $3$, since each triangle is counted once for each of its three vertices. Let $T_i$ be the number of triangles that include node $i$. Due to the rotational symmetry of the ring lattice, $T_i$ is the same for all nodes $i \\in V$. Let us denote this constant value by $T_{\\text{node}}$. The total number of triangles is then:\n$$T_{\\text{tot}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} T_i = \\frac{1}{3} N T_{\\text{node}}$$\nOur task reduces to finding $T_{\\text{node}}$.\n\nLet us calculate $T_{\\text{node}}$ for an arbitrary node, which we can label as node $0$ without loss of generality. A triangle involving node $0$ must be of the form $\\{0, u, v\\}$, where $u$ and $v$ are neighbors of $0$, and $u$ and $v$ are also neighbors of each other. Thus, $T_{\\text{node}}$ is the number of pairs of neighbors of node $0$ that have an edge between them.\n\nThe neighborhood of node $0$, denoted $\\mathcal{N}(0)$, consists of nodes at distances $1, 2, \\dots, m$. These are the nodes $\\{1, 2, \\dots, m\\}$ (the \"right\" neighbors, $\\mathcal{N}_R$) and $\\{N-1, N-2, \\dots, N-m\\}$ (the \"left\" neighbors, $\\mathcal{N}_L$).\n$\\mathcal{N}(0) = \\mathcal{N}_R \\cup \\mathcal{N}_L$, where $\\mathcal{N}_R = \\{1, 2, \\dots, m\\}$ and $\\mathcal{N}_L = \\{N-m, N-m+1, \\dots, N-1\\}$.\nThe size of each set is $|\\mathcal{N}_R| = |\\mathcal{N}_L| = m$. The total degree is $|\\mathcal{N}(0)| = 2m$.\n\nWe count the number of pairs $\\{u,v\\}$ with $u, v \\in \\mathcal{N}(0)$ and $d(u,v) \\le m$. We partition this counting problem into three cases.\n\nCase 1: Both nodes are in $\\mathcal{N}_R$.\nLet $u, v \\in \\mathcal{N}_R$ with $1 \\le u < v \\le m$. The distance is $d(u,v) = \\min(v-u, N-(v-u))$. Since $1 \\le v-u \\le m-1$ and the problem states $N \\ge 2m+1$, we have $N > 2m$, which implies $N-(v-u) > 2m-(m-1) = m+1 > v-u$. Therefore, $d(u,v) = v-u$. The condition for an edge is $v-u \\le m$. Since $v \\le m$ and $u \\ge 1$, $v-u$ is at most $m-1$. The condition is always satisfied. Thus, any pair of distinct nodes in $\\mathcal{N}_R$ is connected. The number of such pairs is the number of ways to choose $2$ nodes from a set of $m$, which is $\\binom{m}{2}$.\n\nCase 2: Both nodes are in $\\mathcal{N}_L$.\nBy the symmetry of the graph, the number of connected pairs within $\\mathcal{N}_L$ must be the same as within $\\mathcal{N}_R$. This number is also $\\binom{m}{2}$.\n\nCase 3: One node is in $\\mathcal{N}_R$ and the other is in $\\mathcal{N}_L$.\nLet $u \\in \\mathcal{N}_R$ and $v \\in \\mathcal{N}_L$. We can write $u=i$ for some $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, m\\}$, and $v=N-j$ for some $j \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, m\\}$. The distance is $d(i, N-j) = \\min(|i-(N-j)|, N-|i-(N-j)|) = \\min(|i+j-N|, N-|i+j-N|)$.\nSince $1 \\le i \\le m$ and $1 \\le j \\le m$, we have $2 \\le i+j \\le 2m$. The condition $N \\ge 2m+1$ ensures that $i+j < N$. Thus, $i+j-N$ is negative, and $|i+j-N| = N-(i+j)$.\nThe distance becomes $d(i, N-j) = \\min(N-(i+j), N - (N-(i+j))) = \\min(N-(i+j), i+j)$.\nAgain using $N \\ge 2m+1$, we have $N > 2m \\ge i+j$. Thus, $d(i, N-j) = i+j$.\nThe condition for an edge between $u$ and $v$ is $i+j \\le m$.\n\nWe must count the number of integer pairs $(i,j)$ such that $1 \\le i \\le m$, $1 \\le j \\le m$, and $i+j \\le m$. We can sum over possible values of $i$:\nIf $i=1$, then $j$ can be $1, 2, \\dots, m-1$. There are $m-1$ choices for $j$.\nIf $i=2$, then $j$ can be $1, 2, \\dots, m-2$. There are $m-2$ choices for $j$.\n...\nIf $i=m-1$, then $j$ can be $1$. There is $1$ choice for $j$.\nIf $i \\ge m$, there are no possible values for $j$ since $j \\ge 1 \\implies i+j > m$.\nThe total number of such pairs is the sum $\\sum_{k=1}^{m-1} k = \\frac{(m-1)m}{2} = \\binom{m}{2}$.\n\nSumming the counts from all three cases, the number of triangles involving node $0$ is:\n$$T_{\\text{node}} = \\binom{m}{2} + \\binom{m}{2} + \\binom{m}{2} = 3\\binom{m}{2} = \\frac{3m(m-1)}{2}$$\n\nFinally, we substitute this into the expression for the total number of triangles:\n$$T_{\\text{tot}} = \\frac{N T_{\\text{node}}}{3} = \\frac{N}{3} \\left( \\frac{3m(m-1)}{2} \\right) = \\frac{Nm(m-1)}{2}$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the total number of triangles in the graph. The expression is an integer for any integer $m \\ge 1$ because $m(m-1)$ is always an even number.",

            "problem": "Consider the Watts-Strogatz small-world network model in which a ring lattice of $N$ nodes is constructed by connecting each node to its $k$ nearest neighbors ($k$ even) and then each undirected edge is independently rewired with probability $p \\in [0,1]$ to a uniformly random node, avoiding self-loops and duplicate edges. The average degree is preserved by construction. Let the global clustering coefficient $C(p)$ be defined as the average of the local clustering coefficients across all nodes, where the local clustering coefficient at node $i$ is $C_{i} = \\frac{2 T_{i}}{k_{i}(k_{i}-1)}$, with $T_{i}$ the number of triangles incident on node $i$ and $k_{i}$ the degree of node $i$.

Your final answer must be a single closed-form expression. No rounding is required and no units should be included in your final expression.",
            "solution": "The global clustering coefficient, $C(p)$, is defined as the average of the local clustering coefficients, $C_i(p)$, over all $N$ nodes in the network:\n$$C(p) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} C_i(p)$$\nIn the Watts-Strogatz model, both the initial regular lattice and the statistical ensemble of rewired networks are homogeneous, meaning that all nodes are statistically equivalent. Therefore, we can express the global clustering coefficient in terms of the expected local clustering coefficient of an arbitrary node $i$:\n$$C(p) \\approx \\langle C_i(p) \\rangle$$\nThe local clustering coefficient for node $i$ at a given rewiring probability $p$ is defined in terms of the expected number of triangles incident on that node, $E[T_i(p)]$, and its degree, $k_i$. Using the problem's assumption, we approximate the degree as constant, $k_i \\approx k$.\n$$C_i(p) \\approx \\frac{2 E[T_i(p)]}{k(k-1)}$$\nThe problem provides a key set of assumptions to construct a mean-field argument. Specifically, we assume that the contribution to $C(p)$ comes entirely from the triangles that were present in the original lattice (at $p=0$) and have survived the rewiring process. The formation of new triangles is considered negligible.\n\nLet $T_i(0)$ be the number of triangles incident on node $i$ in the initial regular lattice (where $p=0$). The clustering coefficient of this initial lattice is:\n$$C(0) = \\frac{2 T_i(0)}{k(k-1)}$$\nNow, we consider the effect of the rewiring process. A triangle is a set of three nodes, say $\\{u,v,w\\}$, connected by three edges: $(u,v)$, $(v,w)$, and $(w,u)$. For a triangle present at $p=0$ to survive the rewiring process, all three of its constituent edges must escape being rewired.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, each edge is rewired independently with probability $p$. Therefore, the probability that a single edge is *not* rewired (i.e., it survives) is $(1-p)$.\nSince a triangle is defined by three distinct edges, and the rewiring events for these edges are independent, the probability that a specific triangle survives is the product of the survival probabilities of its three edges:\n$$P(\\text{triangle survives}) = (1-p) \\times (1-p) \\times (1-p) = (1-p)^3$$\nThe expected number of triangles incident on node $i$ after rewiring, $E[T_i(p)]$, is the initial number of triangles, $T_i(0)$, multiplied by the probability that any given one of them survives. This follows from the linearity of expectation and the assumption that new triangles do not form.\n$$E[T_i(p)] = T_i(0) \\times P(\\text{triangle survives})$$\n$$E[T_i(p)] = T_i(0) (1-p)^3$$\nNow we can write the expression for the clustering coefficient $C(p)$:\n$$C(p) \\approx \\frac{2 E[T_i(p)]}{k(k-1)} = \\frac{2 \\left[ T_i(0) (1-p)^3 \\right]}{k(k-1)}$$\nWe can rearrange this expression to relate it to $C(0)$:\n$$C(p) \\approx \\left( \\frac{2 T_i(0)}{k(k-1)} \\right) (1-p)^3$$\nRecognizing the term in the parenthesis as the definition of $C(0)$, we arrive at the final expression for $C(p)$ in terms of $C(0)$ and $p$:\n$$C(p) = C(0) (1-p)^3$$\nThis result encapsulates the mean-field approximation where the high local clustering of the initial lattice decays cubically as the network is randomized.",

            "solution": "We start from the construction and definitions of the Watts-Strogatz model. The base graph is a ring with $N$ nodes and degree $2k$. The number of undirected edges is $M = Nk$. Each edge is independently rewired with probability $p$, giving an expected number of rewired edges $pM$. Define the expected shortcut density per node as\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{p M}{N} = p k,\n$$\nwhich is the expected number of shortcut endpoints per node contributed by rewiring. Each rewired edge contributes degree $1$ to each of its two endpoint nodes within the random overlay; thus, the overlay formed by the shortcuts has mean degree\n$$\nc = 2 \\rho.\n$$\nWe next outline a mean-field approximation for average shortest path length $L(p)$, relying on two well-tested facts about large random graphs:\n- In an Erdős–Rényi random graph $G(N, c/N)$ with average degree $c$, there is a giant connected component if and only if $c > 1$. Typical distances within the giant component scale as $\\ln N / \\ln c$ for fixed $c > 1$ and large $N$.\n- In the absence of a supercritical random overlay ($c \\leq 1$), typical distances in the base ring scale linearly in $N$, specifically $L(0) \\sim N/(2k)$.\n\nWe will approximate the Watts-Strogatz graph as the union of a one-dimensional ring (providing short-range edges) and a random overlay of shortcuts (providing long-range edges with mean degree $c$). The shortest path structure is controlled by whichever mechanism produces the dominant growth of the breadth-first search (BFS) frontier from a typical node.\n\n**Subcritical overlay regime ($c < 1$):**\nWhen $c = 2 \\rho  1$, the overlay is subcritical and does not contain a giant component. The random overlay contributes only finite-size clusters whose typical size is $O(1)$, and thus cannot fundamentally change the scaling of distances. In this regime, reaching nodes at graph distance $\\ell$ proceeds primarily along the ring structure. Since each additional step along the ring explores $\\Theta(1)$ new nodes per step, the mean distance between two randomly chosen nodes scales linearly with $N$. A standard estimate for the ring is\n$$ L(p) \\approx \\frac{N}{2k}, \\quad \\text{for } c = 2 \\rho  1. $$\nThis maintains the baseline scaling $L(p) = \\Theta(N)$ and reflects that shortcuts are too sparse, in a percolation sense, to alter global distances.\n\n**Supercritical overlay regime ($c > 1$):**\nWhen $c = 2 \\rho > 1$, the overlay produces a giant component and BFS on the overlay expands exponentially with base $c$ in the mean-field sense. From classic random graph theory, typical graph distances supported by the overlay scale as\n$$ L_{\\text{overlay}} \\approx \\frac{\\ln N}{\\ln c} = \\frac{\\ln N}{\\ln (2 \\rho)}, \\quad \\text{for } c = 2 \\rho > 1. $$\nBecause the ring is already connected, access to the giant overlay requires at most an $O(1)$ number of ring steps as $N \\to \\infty$. Such constant offsets are negligible in asymptotics compared with the $\\ln N$ term. Hence, the leading-order scaling of the overall average shortest path length becomes\n$$ L(p) \\approx \\frac{\\ln N}{\\ln (2 \\rho)}, \\quad \\text{for } c = 2 \\rho > 1. $$\n\n**Transition in scaling and the critical constant:**\nThe change from linear scaling $L(p) = \\Theta(N)$ to logarithmic scaling $L(p) = \\Theta(\\ln N)$ occurs when the overlay crosses the percolation threshold that creates a giant component. This threshold is the classical condition $c = 1$, that is,\n$$ 2 \\rho = 1 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad \\rho = \\frac{1}{2}. $$\nThis is a constant that does not depend on $N$ or $k$; it is determined purely by the branching factor of the random overlay. For $\\rho \\leq \\frac{1}{2}$, the overlay is subcritical and cannot induce small-world scaling. For $\\rho > \\frac{1}{2}$, the overlay is supercritical, and distances are asymptotically dominated by the logarithmic behavior inherited from the giant component.\n\nTherefore, the requested mean-field approximations are\n$$ L(p) \\approx \\frac{N}{2k} \\quad \\text{for } \\rho  \\frac{1}{2}, $$\nand\n$$ L(p) \\approx \\frac{\\ln N}{\\ln(2 \\rho)} \\quad \\text{for } \\rho > \\frac{1}{2}, $$\nand the transition occurs when $\\rho$ exceeds the constant $\\rho_{c} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nWe conclude that the critical shortcut density per node at which the average path length transitions from linear to logarithmic scaling is exactly\n$$ \\rho_{c} = \\frac{1}{2}. $$",
