            "problem": "Consider a finite two-player strategic-form game as a micro-level interaction module within a complex adaptive system. Formally represent the game using the standard tuple comprising the set of players, each player’s pure strategy set, and each player’s payoff function. The players are indexed by $N=\\{1,2\\}$ with pure strategy sets $S_{1}=\\{U,D\\}$ and $S_{2}=\\{L,R\\}$. The payoffs are given by matrices $A=\\begin{pmatrix}2&0\\\\1&3\\end{pmatrix}$ and $B=\\begin{pmatrix}2&1\\\\0&3\\end{pmatrix}$, where the entry in row $i$ and column $j$ of $A$ (respectively $B$) gives player $1$’s (respectively player $2$’s) payoff when player $1$ plays the $i$-th strategy in $S_{1}$ and player $2$ plays the $j$-th strategy in $S_{2}$. \n\nUsing only foundational definitions of strategic-form games, pure strategies, best responses, and Nash equilibrium, proceed as follows:\n1.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in game theory, well-posed with a unique and meaningful solution, and objective in its formulation. All necessary data and definitions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or ambiguities. We proceed with the solution by following the specified sequence of tasks.\n\n1. Formal Game Representation\nA strategic-form game is formally represented by a tuple $G=(N,(S_{i})_{i\\in N},(u_{i})_{i\\in N})$.\nThe set of players is given as $N=\\{1,2\\}$.\nThe pure strategy sets for player $1$ and player $2$ are given as $S_{1}=\\{U,D\\}$ and $S_{2}=\\{L,R\\}$, respectively.\nThe set of all pure-strategy profiles is the Cartesian product $S = S_{1}\\times S_{2} = \\{(U,L), (U,R), (D,L), (D,R)\\}$.\nThe payoff functions $u_{1}:S\\to\\mathbb{R}$ and $u_{2}:S\\to\\mathbb{R}$ map each strategy profile to a real-valued payoff for each player. These are defined based on the given payoff matrices $A=\\begin{pmatrix}2&0\\\\1&3\\end{pmatrix}$ for player $1$ and $B=\\begin{pmatrix}2&1\\\\0&3\\end{pmatrix}$ for player $2$. We adopt the standard convention where the first row corresponds to strategy $U$ and the second to $D$ for player $1$, and the first column to strategy $L$ and the second to $R$ for player $2$.\nThe specific payoff assignments are:\nFor player $1$:\n$u_{1}(U,L) = 2$\n$u_{1}(U,R) = 0$\n$u_{1}(D,L) = 1$\n$u_{1}(D,R) = 3$\nFor player $2$:\n$u_{2}(U,L) = 2$\n$u_{2}(U,R) = 1$\n$u_{2}(D,L) = 0$\n$u_{2}(D,R) = 3$\n\n2. Pure-Strategy Profiles and Payoff Vectors\nWe enumerate the four pure-strategy profiles and their corresponding payoff vectors $(u_{1}(s), u_{2}(s))$:\n- Profile $s=(U,L)$: Payoff vector is $(u_{1}(U,L), u_{2}(U,L)) = (2,2)$.\n- Profile $s=(U,R)$: Payoff vector is $(u_{1}(U,R), u_{2}(U,R)) = (0,1)$.\n- Profile $s=(D,L)$: Payoff vector is $(u_{1}(D,L), u_{2}(D,L)) = (1,0)$.\n- Profile $s=(D,R)$: Payoff vector is $(u_{1}(D,R), u_{2}(D,R)) = (3,3)$.\n\n3. Pure-Strategy Nash Equilibria\nA pure-strategy Nash equilibrium (PSNE) is a strategy profile $s^{*}=(s_{1}^{*},s_{2}^{*})$ such that no player has an incentive to unilaterally deviate. Formally, for each player $i\\in N$, $u_{i}(s_{1}^{*},s_{2}^{*}) \\geq u_{i}(s_{i},s_{-i}^{*})$ for all $s_{i} \\in S_{i}$. An equivalent definition uses the best-response correspondence. A player $i$'s best response to a strategy profile $s_{-i}$ of their opponents is the set of strategies $BR_{i}(s_{-i})$ that maximize their payoff: $BR_{i}(s_{-i}) = \\arg\\max_{s_{i}\\in S_{i}} u_{i}(s_{i},s_{-i})$. A strategy profile $s^{*}=(s_{1}^{*},s_{2}^{*})$ is a PSNE if and only if $s_{1}^{*} \\in BR_{1}(s_{2}^{*})$ and $s_{2}^{*} \\in BR_{2}(s_{1}^{*})$.\n\nWe compute the best-response correspondences for each player:\nFor player $1$:\n- Given player $2$ plays $L$, player $1$ chooses between $U$ (payoff $u_{1}(U,L)=2$) and $D$ (payoff $u_{1}(D,L)=1$). Since $2 > 1$, the best response is $U$. So, $BR_{1}(L) = \\{U\\}$.\n- Given player $2$ plays $R$, player $1$ chooses between $U$ (payoff $u_{1}(U,R)=0$) and $D$ (payoff $u_{1}(D,R)=3$). Since $3 > 0$, the best response is $D$. So, $BR_{1}(R) = \\{D\\}$.\n\nFor player $2$:\n- Given player $1$ plays $U$, player $2$ chooses between $L$ (payoff $u_{2}(U,L)=2$) and $R$ (payoff $u_{2}(U,R)=1$). Since $2 > 1$, the best response is $L$. So, $BR_{2}(U) = \\{L\\}$.\n- Given player $1$ plays $D$, player $2$ chooses between $L$ (payoff $u_{2}(D,L)=0$) and $R$ (payoff $u_{2}(D,R)=3$). Since $3 > 0$, the best response is $R$. So, $BR_{2}(D) = \\{R\\}$.\n\nWe now check each profile for the Nash equilibrium condition:\n- Profile $(U,L)$: Is $U \\in BR_{1}(L)$ and $L \\in BR_{2}(U)$? Yes, since $BR_{1}(L)=\\{U\\}$ and $BR_{2}(U)=\\{L\\}$. Thus, $(U,L)$ is a PSNE.\n- Profile $(U,R)$: Is $U \\in BR_{1}(R)$? No, since $BR_{1}(R)=\\{D\\}$. Thus, $(U,R)$ is not a PSNE.\n- Profile $(D,L)$: Is $D \\in BR_{1}(L)$? No, since $BR_{1}(L)=\\{U\\}$. Thus, $(D,L)$ is not a PSNE.\n- Profile $(D,R)$: Is $D \\in BR_{1}(R)$ and $R \\in BR_{2}(D)$? Yes, since $BR_{1}(R)=\\{D\\}$ and $BR_{2}(D)=\\{R\\}$. Thus, $(D,R)$ is a PSNE.\n\nThe set of pure-strategy Nash equilibria is $\\mathrm{NE}_{\\text{pure}} = \\{(U,L), (D,R)\\}$.\n\n4. Social Welfare Calculation\nThe social welfare function is defined as $W(s)=u_{1}(s)+u_{2}(s)$. We compute its value for all profiles:\n- $W(U,L) = u_{1}(U,L) + u_{2}(U,L) = 2+2=4$.\n- $W(U,R) = u_{1}(U,R) + u_{2}(U,R) = 0+1=1$.\n- $W(D,L) = u_{1}(D,L) + u_{2}(D,L) = 1+0=1$.\n- $W(D,R) = u_{1}(D,R) + u_{2}(D,R) = 3+3=6$.\n\nThe maximal social welfare over all pure-strategy profiles is:\n$\\max_{s\\in S_{1}\\times S_{2}}W(s) = \\max\\{4,1,1,6\\} = 6$. This is the socially optimal outcome, achieved at profile $(D,R)$.\n\nThe problem requires the minimal social welfare among the pure-strategy Nash equilibria. The welfares of the equilibria in $\\mathrm{NE}_{\\text{pure}}$ are $W(U,L)=4$ and $W(D,R)=6$.\n$\\min_{s\\in \\mathrm{NE}_{\\text{pure}}}W(s) = \\min\\{W(U,L), W(D,R)\\} = \\min\\{4,6\\} = 4$. This corresponds to the welfare of the \"worst\" Nash equilibrium.\n\n5. Price of Anarchy Calculation\nThe price of anarchy (PoA) is defined as the ratio of the maximal possible social welfare to the minimal social welfare achieved in any equilibrium.\n$\\mathrm{PoA} = \\dfrac{\\max_{s\\in S_{1}\\times S_{2}}W(s)}{\\min_{s\\in \\mathrm{NE}_{\\text{pure}}}W(s)}$\nSubstituting the values calculated in the previous step:\n$\\mathrm{PoA} = \\dfrac{6}{4} = \\dfrac{3}{2}$.\nThis value represents the loss in social efficiency due to selfish, strategic behavior of the agents, comparing the optimal outcome to the worst-case equilibrium outcome.",

            "problem": "Consider a large, well-mixed population of agents repeatedly and randomly matched to play a symmetric two-player, two-strategy coordination game. Each match is between independent draws from the population. The two pure strategies are denoted by $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$. The payoffs are identical for both players and are given by the matrices $A=\\begin{pmatrix}3&0\\\\0&2\\end{pmatrix}$ for the row player and $B=\\begin{pmatrix}3&0\\\\0&2\\end{pmatrix}$ for the column player, where $A_{ij}$ and $B_{ij}$ denote the row and column player’s payoffs when the row player chooses the $i$-th strategy and the column player chooses the $j$-th strategy. The population adapts via myopic decision rules: each agent best responds to a belief about the opponent’s action formed from the current population mix. Assume the belief that an opponent plays $s_{1}$ is $p\\in[0,1]$, and that beliefs are correct in aggregate.\n\nUsing only the foundational definitions of expected payoff, best response, Nash equilibrium, and the basin-of-attraction interpretation of risk dominance in symmetric coordination games, derive the critical belief threshold $p^{*}\\in(0,1)$ at which an agent is indifferent between choosing $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$. In your reasoning, use this $p^{*}$ to justify which of the two pure-strategy Nash equilibria is risk-dominant under Best Response (BR) dynamics, understood as the dynamic where agents choose current best responses to beliefs.\n\nReport the exact value of the indifference threshold $p^{*}$ as a reduced fraction. Do not round. The final answer must be a single number. No units are required.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as self-contained, scientifically grounded in game theory, and well-posed. All necessary information is provided, and the objective is clearly defined. We can proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem describes a symmetric two-player, two-strategy coordination game. The strategies are denoted by $s_1$ and $s_2$. The payoff matrix for the row player is given as $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. Since the game is symmetric, this matrix defines the payoffs for any agent. Let $p \\in [0, 1]$ be an agent's belief that their opponent will play strategy $s_1$. Consequently, the belief that the opponent will play strategy $s_2$ is $1-p$.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in determining the agent's best response based on these beliefs. To do this, we must first calculate the expected payoff for choosing each of the pure strategies, $s_1$ and $s_2$. Let $EU(s_1)$ and $EU(s_2)$ denote the expected payoffs for playing $s_1$ and $s_2$, respectively.\n\nThe expected payoff of playing strategy $s_1$ is calculated by considering the possible outcomes. If an agent chooses $s_1$, they receive a payoff of $A_{11}=3$ if the opponent plays $s_1$ (with probability $p$) and a payoff of $A_{12}=0$ if the opponent plays $s_2$ (with probability $1-p$).\n$$EU(s_1) = p \\cdot A_{11} + (1-p) \\cdot A_{12} = p \\cdot 3 + (1-p) \\cdot 0 = 3p$$\n\nSimilarly, the expected payoff of playing strategy $s_2$ is calculated. If an agent chooses $s_2$, they receive a payoff of $A_{21}=0$ if the opponent plays $s_1$ (with probability $p$) and a payoff of $A_{22}=2$ if the opponent plays $s_2$ (with probability $1-p$).\n$$EU(s_2) = p \\cdot A_{21} + (1-p) \\cdot A_{22} = p \\cdot 0 + (1-p) \\cdot 2 = 2(1-p)$$\n\nThe critical belief threshold, denoted $p^*$, is the value of $p$ at which an agent is indifferent between choosing $s_1$ and $s_2$. Indifference occurs when the expected payoffs are equal.\n$$EU(s_1) = EU(s_2)$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the expected payoffs:\n$$3p = 2(1-p)$$\nWe solve this linear equation for $p$:\n$$3p = 2 - 2p$$\n$$3p + 2p = 2$$\n$$5p = 2$$\n$$p = \\frac{2}{5}$$\nThus, the critical belief threshold is $p^* = \\frac{2}{5}$.\n\nNow, we use this threshold to determine which of the pure-strategy Nash equilibria is risk-dominant. In this game, there are two pure-strategy Nash equilibria: $(s_1, s_1)$ with payoff $(3,3)$ and $(s_2, s_2)$ with payoff $(2,2)$. A mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium also exists where each player plays $s_1$ with probability $p^* = \\frac{2}{5}$.\n\nThe problem specifies using the basin-of-attraction interpretation of risk dominance under Best Response (BR) dynamics. An agent's best response is to choose the strategy with the higher expected payoff.\n- If $p > p^* = \\frac{2}{5}$, then $3p > 2(1-p)$, which implies $EU(s_1) > EU(s_2)$. The best response is to play $s_1$.\n- If $p < p^* = \\frac{2}{5}$, then $3p < 2(1-p)$, which implies $EU(s_1) < EU(s_2)$. The best response is to play $s_2$.\n\nThe basin of attraction for a Nash equilibrium is the set of initial beliefs (in this case, values of $p$) from which a population of myopic best-responders will converge to that equilibrium.\nThe basin of attraction for the $(s_1, s_1)$ equilibrium corresponds to the range of beliefs where $s_1$ is the best response. This is the interval $(p^*, 1]$. The size of this basin is the length of the interval: $1 - p^* = 1 - \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{3}{5}$.\n\nThe basin of attraction for the $(s_2, s_2)$ equilibrium corresponds to the range of beliefs where $s_2$ is the best response. This is the interval $[0, p^*)$. The size of this basin is the length of the interval: $p^* - 0 = p^* = \\frac{2}{5}$.\n\nThe risk-dominant equilibrium is defined as the one with the larger basin of attraction. We compare the sizes of the two basins:\nThe size of the basin of attraction for $(s_1, s_1)$ is $\\frac{3}{5}$.\nThe size of the basin of attraction for $(s_2, s_2)$ is $\\frac{2}{5}$.\n\nSince $\\frac{3}{5} > \\frac{2}{5}$, the basin of attraction for the $(s_1,s_1)$ equilibrium is larger than that for the $(s_2,s_2)$ equilibrium. Therefore, the $(s_1,s_1)$ equilibrium is risk-dominant.\n\nThe problem asks for the exact value of the indifference threshold $p^*$. As derived above, this value is $\\frac{2}{5}$.",

            "solution": "The problem presents a finite congestion game with a set of $N=4$ identical agents and a set of two resources, $E = \\{1, 2\\}$. Each agent must choose exactly one resource. The cost incurred by an agent on a resource $r \\in E$ is a function of the total number of agents, $n_r$, that choose that resource. The specified cost functions are $c_1(n) = n$ for resource $1$ and $c_2(n) = 2n$ for resource $2$. The task is to construct an exact potential function for this game and find a pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) allocation.\n\nFirst, we construct the exact potential function, $\\Phi$, as defined by Rosenthal for congestion games. For a given state of the game, described by an allocation vector of agents $(n_1, n_2)$ where $n_r$ is the number of agents on resource $r$, the potential function is given by the sum over all resources of the sum of costs for adding agents one by one:\n$$\n\\Phi(n_1, n_2) = \\sum_{r \\in E} \\sum_{k=1}^{n_r} c_r(k)\n$$\nFor our specific game with resources $\\{1, 2\\}$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\Phi(n_1, n_2) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n_1} c_1(k) + \\sum_{k=1}^{n_2} c_2(k)\n$$\nSubstituting the given cost functions, $c_1(k)=k$ and $c_2(k)=2k$, we get:\n$$\n\\Phi(n_1, n_2) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n_1} k + \\sum_{k=1}^{n_2} 2k\n$$\nThe first term is the sum of the first $n_1$ positive integers, which has the well-known closed form $\\frac{n_1(n_1+1)}{2}$. The second term is $2$ times the sum of the first $n_2$ positive integers, which evaluates to $2 \\left( \\frac{n_2(n_2+1)}{2} \\right) = n_2(n_2+1)$.\nCombining these terms, we obtain the closed-form expression for the exact potential function:\n$$\n\\Phi(n_1, n_2) = \\frac{n_1(n_1+1)}{2} + n_2(n_2+1)\n$$\nThis function has the property that for any unilateral deviation by an agent, the change in the agent's cost is exactly equal to the change in the potential function.\n\nNext, we find a pure Nash equilibrium allocation $(n_1^{\\ast}, n_2^{\\ast})$. A fundamental theorem of potential games states that any finite potential game has at least one PNE, and these equilibria correspond to the local minima of the potential function. A state that globally minimizes the potential function is guaranteed to be a PNE.\n\nWe need to find the allocation $(n_1, n_2)$ that minimizes $\\Phi(n_1, n_2)$, subject to the constraint that the total number of agents is $N=4$, i.e., $n_1 + n_2 = 4$, where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are non-negative integers. The set of all possible allocations is:\n$$\n\\{(0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0)\\}\n$$\nWe evaluate the potential function $\\Phi(n_1, n_2)$ for each of these states:\n- For $(n_1, n_2) = (0, 4)$: $\\Phi(0, 4) = \\frac{0(0+1)}{2} + 4(4+1) = 0 + 20 = 20$.\n- For $(n_1, n_2) = (1, 3)$: $\\Phi(1, 3) = \\frac{1(1+1)}{2} + 3(3+1) = 1 + 12 = 13$.\n- For $(n_1, n_2) = (2, 2)$: $\\Phi(2, 2) = \\frac{2(2+1)}{2} + 2(2+1) = 3 + 6 = 9$.\n- For $(n_1, n_2) = (3, 1)$: $\\Phi(3, 1) = \\frac{3(3+1)}{2} + 1(1+1) = 6 + 2 = 8$.\n- For $(n_1, n_2) = (4, 0)$: $\\Phi(4, 0) = \\frac{4(4+1)}{2} + 0(0+1) = 10 + 0 = 10$.\n\nThe minimum value of the potential function is $8$, which occurs uniquely at the allocation $(n_1, n_2) = (3, 1)$. Therefore, the pure Nash equilibrium allocation is $(n_1^{\\ast}, n_2^{\\ast}) = (3, 1)$.\n\nTo verify this result from first principles, we analyze the incentives for unilateral deviation from the state $(3, 1)$.\n- An agent on resource $1$: There are $n_1=3$ agents, and their cost is $c_1(3) = 3$. If this agent were to switch to resource $2$, the new allocation would be $(2, 2)$. The number of agents on resource $2$ would become $2$, and the agent's new cost would be $c_2(2) = 2(2) = 4$. Since the new cost ($4$) is greater than the original cost ($3$), there is no incentive to deviate.\n- An agent on resource $2$: There is $n_2=1$ agent, and their cost is $c_2(1) = 2(1) = 2$. If this agent were to switch to resource $1$, the new allocation would be $(4, 0)$. The number of agents on resource $1$ would become $4$, and the agent's new cost would be $c_1(4) = 4$. Since the new cost ($4$) is greater than the original cost ($2$), there is no incentive to deviate.\n\nSince no agent can improve their outcome (i.e., lower their cost) by unilaterally changing their strategy, the allocation $(n_1^{\\ast}, n_2^{\\ast}) = (3, 1)$ is indeed a pure Nash equilibrium.\n\nThe final answer requires the expression for the potential function and the equilibrium allocation numbers.\n- Potential function: $\\Phi(n_1, n_2) = \\frac{n_1(n_1+1)}{2} + n_2(n_2+1)$.\n- Equilibrium allocation: $n_1^{\\ast} = 3$, $n_2^{\\ast} = 1$.",
