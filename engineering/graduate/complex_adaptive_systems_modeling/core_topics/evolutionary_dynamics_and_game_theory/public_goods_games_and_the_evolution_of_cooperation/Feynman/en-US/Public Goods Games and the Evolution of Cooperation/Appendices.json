            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the economic theory of public goods, is well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. We will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe goal is to derive the symmetric Nash equilibrium contribution per agent, $x^{\\mathrm{NE}}$, and the symmetric social optimum contribution per agent, $x^{\\mathrm{SO}}$, and then to compute their ratio.\n\nFirst, we determine the symmetric Nash equilibrium contribution, $x^{\\mathrm{NE}}$. A Nash equilibrium is a strategy profile where each agent's choice is a best response to the choices of all other agents. This means that for each agent $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, their contribution $x_i$ must maximize their individual payoff $\\pi_i$, given the contributions $\\mathbf{x}_{-i}$ of the other agents.\n\nThe payoff function for agent $i$ is:\n$$\n\\pi_i(x_i, \\mathbf{x}_{-i}) = m \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j}{n} - \\frac{1}{2} a x_i^2\n$$\nTo find the optimal contribution for agent $i$, we treat the contributions of other agents, $\\sum_{j \\neq i}x_j$, as fixed and maximize $\\pi_i$ with respect to $x_i$. We can rewrite the payoff function to isolate the terms dependent on $x_i$:\n$$\n\\pi_i(x_i, \\mathbf{x}_{-i}) = m \\frac{x_i + \\sum_{j \\neq i} x_j}{n} - \\frac{1}{2} a x_i^2 = \\frac{m}{n} x_i + \\frac{m}{n}\\sum_{j \\neq i} x_j - \\frac{1}{2} a x_i^2\n$$\nTo find the maximum, we take the first-order condition (FOC) by differentiating $\\pi_i$ with respect to $x_i$ and setting the result to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\pi_i}{\\partial x_i} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} \\left( \\frac{m}{n} x_i + \\frac{m}{n}\\sum_{j \\neq i} x_j - \\frac{1}{2} a x_i^2 \\right) = \\frac{m}{n} - a x_i\n$$\nSetting the derivative to zero gives the best response for agent $i$:\n$$\n\\frac{m}{n} - a x_i = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad x_i = \\frac{m}{an}\n$$\nTo confirm this is a maximum, we check the second-order condition (SOC):\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\pi_i}{\\partial x_i^2} = -a\n$$\nSince $a0$, the second derivative is negative, indicating that the payoff function is strictly concave in $x_i$, and thus $x_i = \\frac{m}{an}$ is indeed a unique maximum.\n\nThe problem asks for a symmetric Nash equilibrium, where $x_i = x$ for all $i$. The best-response function derived above, $x_i = \\frac{m}{an}$, is independent of the other agents' contributions. Therefore, in a symmetric equilibrium, every agent will choose this level of contribution. Thus, the symmetric Nash equilibrium contribution per agent is:\n$$\nx^{\\mathrm{NE}} = \\frac{m}{an}\n$$\nSince $m0$, $a0$, and $n \\ge 1$, we have $x^{\\mathrm{NE}}  0$, satisfying the condition for an interior solution.\n\nNext, we determine the symmetric social optimum contribution, $x^{\\mathrm{SO}}$. The social optimum is the contribution profile that maximizes the aggregate payoff of all agents, $\\Pi = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\pi_i$.\nThe aggregate payoff is:\n$$\n\\Pi(\\mathbf{x}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\pi_i(\\mathbf{x}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( m \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j}{n} - \\frac{1}{2} a x_i^2 \\right)\n$$\nLet $X = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j$ be the total contribution. The aggregate payoff simplifies to:\n$$\n\\Pi(\\mathbf{x}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\frac{mX}{n} \\right) - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} a x_i^2 \\right) = n \\left(\\frac{mX}{n}\\right) - \\frac{1}{2} a \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 = m \\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j - \\frac{1}{2} a \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2\n$$\nThe problem states we are looking for a symmetric social optimum, where $x_i = x$ for all $i$. Under this assumption, the total contribution is $X = nx$, and the sum of squared contributions is $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 = nx^2$. Substituting these into the aggregate payoff function gives a function of the single variable $x$:\n$$\n\\Pi(x) = m(nx) - \\frac{1}{2} a (nx^2) = nmx - \\frac{n}{2} a x^2\n$$\nTo find the value of $x$ that maximizes this aggregate payoff, we take the first-order condition with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\Pi}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( nmx - \\frac{n}{2} a x^2 \\right) = nm - nax\n$$\nSetting the derivative to zero:\n$$\nnm - nax = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad x = \\frac{nm}{na} = \\frac{m}{a}\n$$\nTo confirm this is a maximum, we check the second-order condition:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\Pi}{dx^2} = -na\n$$\nSince $n \\ge 1$ and $a0$, the second derivative is negative, confirming that $x = \\frac{m}{a}$ corresponds to a maximum.

There are two heritable strategies: cooperation and defection. A cooperator invests a cost $c  0$ to contribute to a group fund, while a defector invests nothing. The total contribution in a group is multiplied by a factor $m > 0$ and then divided equally among all $n$ group members. Thus, in a group with $k$ cooperators, every member receives a material payoff $m c k / n$, and each cooperator additionally pays the cost $c$.\n\nAssume weak selection of intensity $s  0$: individual fitness is $1 + s \\pi$, where $\\pi$ is the material payoff.

It describes a canonical model from evolutionary game theory used to study the evolution of cooperation. The definitions of the public goods game, fitness under weak selection, and regression-based relatedness are all standard in the field of complex adaptive systems modeling and social evolution theory. The problem is self-contained, with no missing information or contradictions. All parameters are clearly defined. The tasks are specific and lead to a unique, verifiable mathematical result. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Proceed to Solution\n\nLet $I \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ be an indicator variable for the strategy of an individual, where $I=1$ for a cooperator and $I=0$ for a defector. The frequency of cooperators in the population is $x = E[I]$.\n\nThe payoff of a focal individual with strategy $I_0$ in a group of size $n$ depends on the number of cooperators in the group, $k$. Let the strategies of the other $n-1$ group members be $I_1, I_2, \\ldots, I_{n-1}$. The total number of cooperators is $k = I_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} I_j$.\nThe payoff to the focal individual is:\n$$ \\pi(I_0) = \\frac{mc}{n} k - c I_0 = \\frac{mc}{n} \\left( I_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} I_j \\right) - c I_0 $$\nUnder weak selection ($s \\ll 1$), the direction of selection is determined by the sign of the expected payoff difference between a cooperator and a defector. This difference is the selection gradient, $G = E[\\pi_C] - E[\\pi_D]$.\n\n**1) Random Mixing ($r=0$)**\n\nUnder random mixing, the probability that any other group member is a cooperator is simply the population frequency, $x$. The number of other cooperators, $K' = \\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} I_j$, among the $n-1$ partners follows a binomial distribution with parameters $n-1$ and $x$. The expected number of other cooperators is $E[K'] = (n-1)x$.\n\nThe expected payoff for a focal cooperator ($I_0=1$) is:\n$$ E[\\pi_C] = E\\left[\\frac{mc}{n}(1+K') - c\\right] = \\frac{mc}{n}(1+E[K']) - c = \\frac{mc}{n}(1+(n-1)x) - c $$\nThe expected payoff for a focal defector ($I_0=0$) is:\n$$ E[\\pi_D] = E\\left[\\frac{mc}{n}(K')\\right] = \\frac{mc}{n}E[K'] = \\frac{mc}{n}(n-1)x $$\nThe selection gradient is the difference between these expected payoffs:\n$$ G = E[\\pi_C] - E[\\pi_D] = \\left( \\frac{mc}{n}(1+(n-1)x) - c \\right) - \\left( \\frac{mc}{n}(n-1)x \\right) $$\n$$ G = \\frac{mc}{n} + \\frac{mc(n-1)x}{n} - c - \\frac{mc(n-1)x}{n} = \\frac{mc}{n} - c = c\\left(\\frac{m}{n} - 1\\right) $$\nThis is the selection gradient under random mixing ($r=0$). Cooperation increases from rarity (i.e., when $x \\to 0$) if this gradient is positive. Since $c  0$, the condition is:\n$$ \\frac{m}{n} - 1  0 \\implies m  n $$\n\n**2) Kin Assortment and Threshold Relatedness $r^{\\star}$**\n\nWith kin assortment, the composition of the group is no longer random. The relatedness $r$ is the regression coefficient of a partner's phenotype ($I_j$) on the focal's phenotype ($I_0$). A standard result from regression analysis is that the expected phenotype of a partner, given the focal's phenotype, is $E[I_j | I_0] = E[I_j] + r(I_0 - E[I_0])$. With $E[I_j] = E[I_0] = x$, this becomes:\n$$ E[I_j | I_0] = x + r(I_0 - x) $$\nThe expected number of cooperators among the $n-1$ partners of a focal individual with strategy $I_0$ is:\n$$ E\\left[\\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} I_j \\Big| I_0 \\right] = \\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} E[I_j | I_0] = (n-1)(x + r(I_0 - x)) $$\nThe expected payoff for a focal individual with strategy $I_0$ is:\n$$ E[\\pi(I_0)] = E\\left[ \\frac{mc}{n} \\left( I_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} I_j \\right) - c I_0 \\Big| I_0 \\right] $$\n$$ E[\\pi(I_0)] = \\frac{mc}{n} \\left( I_0 + (n-1)(x + r(I_0 - x)) \\right) - c I_0 $$\nThe selection gradient can be found by evaluating the fitness benefit of switching from defection ($I_0=0$) to cooperation ($I_0=1$), which is $E[\\pi(1)] - E[\\pi(0)]$.\nFor a cooperator ($I_0=1$):\n$$ E[\\pi_C] = E[\\pi(1)] = \\frac{mc}{n} \\left( 1 + (n-1)(x + r(1 - x)) \\right) - c $$\nFor a defector ($I_0=0$):\n$$ E[\\pi_D] = E[\\pi(0)] = \\frac{mc}{n} \\left( 0 + (n-1)(x + r(0 - x)) \\right) - 0 = \\frac{mc}{n} (n-1)(x - rx) $$\nThe selection gradient $G(r)$ is:\n$$ G(r) = E[\\pi_C] - E[\\pi_D] = \\left[ \\frac{mc}{n} (1 + (n-1)(x+r-rx)) - c \\right] - \\left[ \\frac{mc}{n} (n-1)(x-rx) \\right] $$\n$$ G(r) = \\frac{mc}{n} + \\frac{mc(n-1)}{n}(x+r-rx) - c - \\frac{mc(n-1)}{n}(x-rx) $$\n$$ G(r) = \\frac{mc}{n} - c + \\frac{mc(n-1)}{n} \\left[ (x+r-rx) - (x-rx) \\right] $$\n$$ G(r) = \\frac{mc}{n} - c + \\frac{mc(n-1)}{n} (r) = c \\left( \\frac{m}{n} - 1 + \\frac{mr(n-1)}{n} \\right) $$\nThis expression is a form of Hamilton's rule, where $\\frac{m}{n}-1$ is the scaled direct fitness effect and $\\frac{mr(n-1)}{n}$ is the scaled indirect fitness effect.\n\nThe threshold relatedness $r^{\\star}$ is the value of $r$ for which the selection gradient is exactly zero, meaning cooperation is neutrally selected.\n$$ G(r^{\\star}) = 0 \\implies \\frac{m}{n} - 1 + \\frac{mr^{\\star}(n-1)}{n} = 0 $$\nSolving for $r^{\\star}$:\n$$ \\frac{mr^{\\star}(n-1)}{n} = 1 - \\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{n-m}{n} $$\n$$ mr^{\\star}(n-1) = n-m $$\n$$ r^{\\star} = \\frac{n-m}{m(n-1)} $$\nThis is the minimal relatedness required for cooperation to be favored (or at least, not selected against).\n\n**3) Evaluation of $r^{\\star}$**\n\nWe are given the parameters $n=5$ and $m=3$. The cost $c  0$ cancels out from the calculation of $r^{\\star}$. Substituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$ r^{\\star} = \\frac{5 - 3}{3(5 - 1)} $$\n$$ r^{\\star} = \\frac{2}{3(4)} $$\n$$ r^{\\star} = \\frac{2}{12} $$\n$$ r^{\\star} = \\frac{1}{6} $$\nThe minimal relatedness for cooperation to be neutrally selected under these conditions is $\\frac{1}{6}$.

Specifically, letting $k$ be the total number of cooperators in a group:\n$P_{C}(k) = (\\frac{mc}{n} + \\gamma)k - (c + n\\gamma)$\n$P_{D}(k) = (\\frac{mc}{n} - \\beta)k$\nDue to this linearity, the expected payoff can be found by substituting the expected number of cooperators, $\\mathbb{E}[k]$, into the payoff function.\n\nFor a focal cooperator, the group consists of this individual plus $K$ other cooperators and $(n-1)-K$ defectors. The total number of cooperators in the group is $k = K+1$.
