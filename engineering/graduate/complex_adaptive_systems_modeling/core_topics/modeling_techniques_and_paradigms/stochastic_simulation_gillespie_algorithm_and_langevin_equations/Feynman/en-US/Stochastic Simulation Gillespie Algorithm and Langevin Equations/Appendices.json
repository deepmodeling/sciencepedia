This is a special property of reaction systems with propensities that are at most linear in the state variables. In this case, the CLE does not approximate the dynamics of the first two moments but captures them exactly.\n\nFinally, we compute the stationary mean and variance.\nLet $\\mu = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} m_1(t)$ and $\\mu_2 = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} m_2(t)$. At steady state, the time derivatives are zero, so $\\frac{dm_1}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{dm_2}{dt} = 0$.\nFrom the equation for the first moment:\n$$ 0 = \\alpha - \\beta \\mu \\implies \\mu = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta} $$\nThis is the stationary mean $\\mu = \\mathbb{E}[X(\\infty)]$.\nFrom the equation for the second moment:\n$$ 0 = (2\\alpha + \\beta)\\mu - 2\\beta \\mu_2 + \\alpha $$\n$$ 2\\beta \\mu_2 = (2\\alpha + \\beta)\\mu + \\alpha $$\nSubstitute the expression for $\\mu$:\n$$ 2\\beta \\mu_2 = (2\\alpha + \\beta)\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta} + \\alpha = \\frac{2\\alpha^2}{\\beta} + \\frac{\\alpha\\beta}{\\beta} + \\alpha = \\frac{2\\alpha^2}{\\beta} + 2\\alpha $$\n$$ \\mu_2 = \\frac{1}{2\\beta}\\left(\\frac{2\\alpha^2}{\\beta} + 2\\alpha\\right) = \\frac{\\alpha^2}{\\beta^2} + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta} $$\nThis is the stationary second moment $\\mu_2 = \\mathbb{E}[X(\\infty)^2]$.\nThe stationary covariance, which for a single species is its variance $\\Sigma$, is calculated as:\n$$ \\Sigma = \\mathrm{Var}(X(\\infty)) = \\mathbb{E}[X(\\infty)^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[X(\\infty)])^2 = \\mu_2 - \\mu^2 $$\n$$ \\Sigma = \\left(\\frac{\\alpha^2}{\\beta^2} + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\alpha^2}{\\beta^2} + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta} - \\frac{\\alpha^2}{\\beta^2} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta} $$\nSince the moment equations were identical for both the CLE and CME approaches, the stationary moments derived are also identical. The CLE provides an exact result for the first two stationary moments for this linear system. The stationary mean is $\\mu = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}$ and the stationary variance is $\\Sigma = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}$.\nThe result matches the known properties of a Poisson distribution with parameter $\\lambda = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}$, which is the exact stationary distribution of the CME for this process.\n\nThe final answer consists of the stationary mean $\\mu$ and stationary covariance (variance) $\\Sigma$.",

The term $b(x)\\Delta W_t$ is of order $\\sqrt{\\Delta t}$, while all other terms in $\\Delta x$ are of order $\\Delta t$ or higher. Thus, the leading contribution to $(\\Delta x)^2$ is $(b(x)\\Delta W_t)^2$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[(\\Delta x)^2] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\left( a(x)\\Delta t + \\frac{1}{2}b(x)b'(x)(\\Delta W_t)^2 + b(x)\\Delta W_t \\right)^2 \\right] \\approx \\mathbb{E}\\left[ (b(x)\\Delta W_t)^2 \\right] + O((\\Delta t)^{3/2})\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[(\\Delta x)^2] = b(x)^2\\mathbb{E}[(\\Delta W_t)^2] + O((\\Delta t)^{3/2}) = b(x)^2\\Delta t + O((\\Delta t)^{3/2})\n$$\n$$\nD^{(2)}(x) = \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\left( b(x)^2\\Delta t + O((\\Delta t)^{3/2}) \\right) = b(x)^2\n$$\nAs before, higher-order coefficients vanish.

            "solution": "The analysis begins with the problem statement's definition of the implicit Euler discretization for the given Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). The SDE is a linear mean-reverting process:\n$$\ndX(t) = -\\lambda X(t)\\,dt + \\sigma\\,dW(t)\n$$\nwith parameters $\\lambda > 0$ and $\\sigma \\ge 0$.\n\nThe implicit Euler method for an SDE of the form $dX = f(X)dt + g(X)dW$ is given by:\n$$\nX_{n+1} = X_n + f(X_{n+1})\\,\\Delta t + g(X_n)\\,\\Delta W_n\n$$\nIn this specific problem, the drift is $f(X) = -\\lambda X$ and the diffusion term is a constant $g(X) = \\sigma$. The problem statement specifies the discretized form as:\n$$\nX_{n+1} = X_n + f(X_{n+1})\\,\\Delta t + \\sigma\\,\\Delta W_n\n$$\nSubstituting the given drift function $f(X_{n+1}) = -\\lambda X_{n+1}$ into this update rule yields:\n$$\nX_{n+1} = X_n - \\lambda X_{n+1} \\Delta t + \\sigma\\,\\Delta W_n\n$$\nTo analyze the evolution of the state, we first solve for $X_{n+1}$ explicitly in terms of $X_n$ and the noise increment $\\Delta W_n$. We rearrange the equation to group terms involving $X_{n+1}$:\n$$\nX_{n+1} + \\lambda X_{n+1} \\Delta t = X_n + \\sigma\\,\\Delta W_n\n$$\nFactoring out $X_{n+1}$ on the left-hand side gives:\n$$\nX_{n+1}(1 + \\lambda \\Delta t) = X_n + \\sigma\\,\\Delta W_n\n$$\nSince $\\lambda > 0$ and $\\Delta t > 0$, the term $1 + \\lambda \\Delta t$ is strictly positive and greater than $1$, so we can divide by it:\n$$\nX_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\lambda \\Delta t} X_n + \\frac{\\sigma}{1 + \\lambda \\Delta t} \\Delta W_n\n$$\nThis equation provides a one-step map for the discretized state variable. To investigate mean-square stability, we need to find a recurrence relation for the second moment, $\\mathbb{E}[X_n^2]$. We proceed by squaring both sides of the equation for $X_{n+1}$:\n$$\nX_{n+1}^2 = \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\lambda \\Delta t} X_n + \\frac{\\sigma}{1 + \\lambda \\Delta t} \\Delta W_n \\right)^2\n$$\nExpanding the binomial on the right-hand side, we get:\n$$\nX_{n+1}^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + \\lambda \\Delta t}\\right)^2 X_n^2 + 2 \\frac{\\sigma}{(1 + \\lambda \\Delta t)^2} X_n \\Delta W_n + \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{1 + \\lambda \\Delta t}\\right)^2 (\\Delta W_n)^2\n$$\nNow, we take the expectation $\\mathbb{E}[\\cdot]$ of both sides. By the linearity of the expectation operator, we have:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_{n+1}^2] = \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + \\lambda \\Delta t}\\right)^2 \\mathbb{E}[X_n^2] + \\frac{2\\sigma}{(1 + \\lambda \\Delta t)^2} \\mathbb{E}[X_n \\Delta W_n] + \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{1 + \\lambda \\Delta t}\\right)^2 \\mathbb{E}[(\\Delta W_n)^2]\n$$\nWe use the properties of the Wiener increment $\\Delta W_n$ provided in the problem. First, $\\Delta W_n$ is independent of the state $X_n$ at the beginning of the time step. This allows us to separate the expectation of the product in the cross-term:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_n \\Delta W_n] = \\mathbb{E}[X_n] \\mathbb{E}[\\Delta W_n]\n$$\nWe are given that $\\mathbb{E}[\\Delta W_n] = 0$. Therefore, the cross-term vanishes:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_n \\Delta W_n] = \\mathbb{E}[X_n] \\cdot 0 = 0\n$$\nSecond, we are given the variance of the Wiener increment: $\\mathbb{E}[(\\Delta W_n)^2] = \\Delta t$.\nSubstituting these results back into the equation for $\\mathbb{E}[X_{n+1}^2]$ yields the recurrence relation for the mean-square value:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_{n+1}^2] = \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + \\lambda \\Delta t}\\right)^2 \\mathbb{E}[X_n^2] + \\frac{\\sigma^2 \\Delta t}{(1 + \\lambda \\Delta t)^2}\n$$\nThis is a linear recurrence of the form $y_{n+1} = A y_n + B$, where $y_n = \\mathbb{E}[X_n^2]$. The mean-square amplification factor is defined as the factor $A$ that multiplies the previous mean-square value $\\mathbb{E}[X_n^2]$ in the homogeneous part of the recurrence. By inspection, this factor is:\n$$\nR(\\lambda, \\Delta t) = \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + \\lambda \\Delta t}\\right)^2\n$$\nFor the sake of completeness, the condition for mean-square stability requires that the mean-square value $\\mathbb{E}[X_n^2]$ remains bounded as the number of steps $n$ approaches infinity. For a recurrence of the form $y_{n+1} = A y_n + B$, this is guaranteed if the magnitude of the amplification factor is less than one, i.e., $|A| < 1$. In our case:\n$$\n\\left| \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + \\lambda \\Delta t}\\right)^2 \\right| < 1\n$$\nSince $\\lambda > 0$ and $\\Delta t > 0$, the denominator $1 + \\lambda \\Delta t$ is always greater than $1$. Consequently, its inverse $\\frac{1}{1 + \\lambda \\Delta t}$ is a positive number less than $1$. Squaring this value preserves this property, so $0 < R(\\lambda, \\Delta t) < 1$. The stability condition is thus satisfied for all $\\Delta t > 0$, which means the implicit Euler method is unconditionally mean-square stable for this SDE.\n\nThe problem asks specifically for the closed-form analytic expression for the mean-square amplification factor. As derived, this is the coefficient of $\\mathbb{E}[X_n^2]$ in the recurrence relation.",
