            "problem": "Consider a binary string environment used in a Genetic Algorithm (GA) where individuals are represented by fixed-length bitstrings of length $l$. A schema is a template over $\\{0,1,*\\}$ of length $l$ where $*$ denotes a wildcard that matches either $0$ or $1$. The order of a schema $H$, denoted $o(H)$, is the number of fixed (non-$*$) positions in the template. The defining length of a schema $H$, denoted $\\delta(H)$, is the distance between the leftmost and rightmost fixed positions, measured in indices under $1$-indexed coordinates; that is, if the leftmost and rightmost fixed positions are at indices $i_{\\min}$ and $i_{\\max}$, respectively, then $\\delta(H) = i_{\\max} - i_{\\min}$. In one-point crossover, the crossover point is selected uniformly at random from the $l-1$ possible positions between adjacent bits, and crossover occurs with probability $p_c$.\n\nWork in the setting $l=10$ and construct two explicit schemas $H_{\\mathrm{adj}}$ and $H_{\\mathrm{span}}$ with $o(H)=3$ that illustrate edge cases. In $H_{\\mathrm{adj}}$, the three fixed positions are adjacent. In $H_{\\mathrm{span}}$, the three fixed positions span most of the string by placing two fixed positions at the ends.\n\nStarting from the definitions above and first principles about uniformly random one-point crossover, compute $\\delta(H_{\\mathrm{adj}})$ and $\\delta(H_{\\mathrm{span}})$, and then determine the difference between the upper bounds on their disruption probabilities under one-point crossover with $p_c = \\frac{3}{5}$. For this purpose, treat any crossover point falling strictly between the leftmost and rightmost fixed positions of a schema as potentially disruptive. Express the final answer as a single exact fraction, with no rounding.",
            "solution": "The supplied problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of genetic algorithms, well-posed with sufficient information, and objectively stated. We will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem asks us to analyze two schemas, $H_{\\mathrm{adj}}$ and $H_{\\mathrm{span}}$, within the context of a genetic algorithm operating on binary strings of length $l=10$. Both schemas must have an order of $o(H)=3$.\n\nFirst, we construct the two schemas according to the problem's specifications. The specific values ($0$ or $1$) in the fixed positions are irrelevant for the calculation of defining length and disruption probability, as is the exact placement of interior fixed bits, provided the structural constraints are met.\n\nFor $H_{\\mathrm{adj}}$, the three fixed positions must be adjacent. We can place them at the beginning of the string for simplicity, at indices $i=1, 2, 3$. An example of such a schema is $H_{\\mathrm{adj}} = 111*******$. The leftmost fixed position is at index $i_{\\min}=1$, and the rightmost is at $i_{\\max}=3$. The defining length, $\\delta(H)$, is defined as $\\delta(H) = i_{\\max} - i_{\\min}$.\nFor our constructed schema $H_{\\mathrm{adj}}$:\n$$\n\\delta(H_{\\mathrm{adj}}) = 3 - 1 = 2\n$$\nThis result is independent of where the block of three adjacent bits is placed. For instance, if the fixed positions were $5, 6, 7$, then $\\delta(H_{\\mathrm{adj}}) = 7 - 5 = 2$.\n\nFor $H_{\\mathrm{span}}$, the three fixed positions must include the two ends of the string. For a string of length $l=10$ with $1$-based indexing, the ends are at indices $1$ and $10$. The third fixed position can be at any index between $2$ and $9$. Let us place it at index $5$. An example of such a schema is $H_{\\mathrm{span}} = 1***1****0$. The leftmost fixed position is at $i_{\\min}=1$, and the rightmost is at $i_{\\max}=10$.\nFor our constructed schema $H_{\\mathrm{span}}$:\n$$\n\\delta(H_{\\mathrm{span}}) = 10 - 1 = 9\n$$\nThis result is independent of the location of the third fixed bit, as $\\delta(H)$ only depends on the outermost fixed positions.\n\nNext, we determine the upper bound on the disruption probability for each schema under one-point crossover. In a genetic algorithm, a schema $H$ is disrupted by crossover if the crossover event separates the defining bits of the schema. The probability of crossover occurring is given as $p_c = \\frac{3}{5}$.\n\nFor a string of length $l$, there are $l-1$ possible locations for a one-point crossover, between adjacent bits. The crossover point is chosen uniformly at random from these $l-1$ positions. In this problem, $l=10$, so there are $10-1=9$ possible crossover points.\n\nThe problem states that a crossover is disruptive if the crossover point falls strictly between the leftmost and rightmost fixed positions. The crossover points can be indexed by the position of the bit they follow. A crossover after bit $k$ is disruptive if $i_{\\min} \\le k < i_{\\max}$. The number of such disruptive points is $(i_{\\max}-1) - i_{\\min} + 1 = i_{\\max} - i_{\\min} = \\delta(H)$.\n\nThe probability that a randomly chosen crossover point is disruptive is the ratio of the number of disruptive points to the total number of possible points: $\\frac{\\delta(H)}{l-1}$.\n\nThe upper bound for the probability of disruption, $P_d(H)$, is the probability that crossover occurs, $p_c$, multiplied by the probability that the chosen crossover point falls within the defining length of the schema.\n$$\nP_{d, \\text{upper}}(H) = p_c \\frac{\\delta(H)}{l-1}\n$$\n\nNow, we apply this formula to our two schemas, using $p_c=\\frac{3}{5}$, $l=10$, $\\delta(H_{\\mathrm{adj}})=2$, and $\\delta(H_{\\mathrm{span}})=9$.\n\nFor $H_{\\mathrm{adj}}$:\n$$\nP_{d, \\text{upper}}(H_{\\mathrm{adj}}) = \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{\\delta(H_{\\mathrm{adj}})}{l-1} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{2}{10-1} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{6}{45} = \\frac{2}{15}\n$$\n\nFor $H_{\\mathrm{span}}$:\n$$\nP_{d, \\text{upper}}(H_{\\mathrm{span}}) = \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{\\delta(H_{\\mathrm{span}})}{l-1} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{9}{10-1} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{9}{9} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 1 = \\frac{3}{5}\n$$\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the difference between these two upper bounds. We calculate $P_{d, \\text{upper}}(H_{\\mathrm{span}}) - P_{d, \\text{upper}}(H_{\\mathrm{adj}})$:\n$$\n\\text{Difference} = \\frac{3}{5} - \\frac{2}{15}\n$$\nTo subtract these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $15$.\n$$\n\\text{Difference} = \\frac{3 \\times 3}{5 \\times 3} - \\frac{2}{15} = \\frac{9}{15} - \\frac{2}{15} = \\frac{7}{15}\n$$\nThis result illustrates a core principle of the Schema Theorem: schemas with shorter defining lengths (like $H_{\\mathrm{adj}}$) are less likely to be disrupted by crossover than schemas with long defining lengths (like $H_{\\mathrm{span}}$), and are thus more likely to propagate to the next generation.",

            "problem": "In a standard genetic algorithm on fixed-length binary strings, consider the basic structural concept of a schema as a template that specifies fixed values at a subset of positions and wildcards elsewhere. Let the string length be $l=16$. For a schema, its order is the number of fixed positions, and its defining length is the index distance between its rightmost and leftmost fixed positions. The population evolves under two variation operators: single-point crossover and independent bitwise mutation. Single-point crossover is applied with probability $p_{c}=0.65$ by choosing one of the $l-1$ cut points uniformly at random and swapping suffixes between two parents. Independent bitwise mutation flips each bit with probability $p_{m}=0.01$. Assume the standard transmission model in which an individual instantiating a schema produces an offspring through mating and variation; define the resilience of a schema as the probability that an instance of the schema in a parent is transmitted as an instance of the same schema to the offspring after the variation operators (crossover and mutation), ignoring selection effects and schema creation from non-instances.\n\nThree schemas are specified as follows (each schema is equivalently described by the set of constrained positions and their required values, with the remainder being wildcards):\n- Schema A: constrained positions $\\{(1,1),(3,0),(7,1)\\}$, all other positions are wildcards.\n- Schema B: constrained positions $\\{(2,1),(6,0),(14,1)\\}$, all other positions are wildcards.\n- Schema C: constrained positions $\\{(4,1),(7,1),(10,0),(13,1)\\}$, all other positions are wildcards.\n\nStarting from the core definitions of order and defining length of a schema, the mechanism of single-point crossover as a uniformly random cut among $l-1$ positions, and independent bitwise mutation with per-bit flip probability $p_{m}$, derive the resilience of each of the three schemas by first principles. Then, rank the schemas by expected resilience under crossover and mutation, and compute the ratio of the highest resilience to the lowest resilience. Express your final answer as a single simplified fraction. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the resilience of three specified schemas under single-point crossover and bitwise mutation, and the ratio of the highest to lowest resilience. Resilience is defined as the probability that an instance of a schema is transmitted from a parent to an offspring, ignoring selection effects and the creation of new schema instances. This is equivalent to the schema's survival probability under the genetic operators of crossover and mutation.\n\nLet $H$ be a schema. Its resilience, which we denote as $P_{surv}(H)$, can be calculated as the product of its survival probabilities under crossover and mutation, as these events are modeled to occur independently.\n$$P_{surv}(H) = P_{surv,c}(H) \\cdot P_{surv,m}(H)$$\nwhere $P_{surv,c}(H)$ is the survival probability under crossover and $P_{surv,m}(H)$ is the survival probability under mutation.\n\nWe are given the following parameters:\n- String length: $l=16$\n- Crossover probability: $p_c = 0.65$\n- Mutation probability (per bit): $p_m = 0.01$\n\nFirst, let's analyze the survival probability under single-point crossover, $P_{surv,c}(H)$.\nCrossover is applied to a pair of parents with probability $p_c$. If crossover is not applied (with probability $1-p_c$), the parent chromosome is copied to the offspring, and the schema instance survives this stage.\nIf crossover is applied, a single cut point is chosen uniformly at random from the $l-1$ possible positions (between bit $1$ and $2$, ..., between bit $l-1$ and $l$). A schema $H$ is disrupted if this cut point falls within its defining region. The defining length of a schema, $\\delta(H)$, is the distance between its rightmost and leftmost fixed positions. If the first fixed position is at index $i_{first}$ and the last is at index $i_{last}$, then $\\delta(H) = i_{last} - i_{first}$. The number of cut points that fall within this region is $\\delta(H)$.\nThe probability of choosing a disruptive cut point, given that crossover occurs, is $\\frac{\\delta(H)}{l-1}$.\nTherefore, the probability that the schema survives, given that crossover occurs, is $1 - \\frac{\\delta(H)}{l-1}$.\nCombining these cases, the total survival probability under crossover is:\n$$P_{surv,c}(H) = (1-p_c) \\cdot 1 + p_c \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{\\delta(H)}{l-1}\\right) = 1 - p_c + p_c - p_c\\frac{\\delta(H)}{l-1} = 1 - p_c \\frac{\\delta(H)}{l-1}$$\n\nNext, let's analyze the survival probability under bitwise mutation, $P_{surv,m}(H)$.\nThe order of a schema, $o(H)$, is the number of fixed positions it specifies. For a schema instance to survive mutation, none of its $o(H)$ defining bits must be flipped. The probability that a single bit flips (is mutated) is $p_m$. Thus, the probability that a single bit does not flip is $1-p_m$. Since mutations are independent for each bit, the probability that none of the $o(H)$ fixed bits flip is:\n$$P_{surv,m}(H) = (1-p_m)^{o(H)}$$\n\nCombining these, the resilience of a schema $H$ is given by:\n$$P_{surv}(H) = \\left(1 - p_c \\frac{\\delta(H)}{l-1}\\right) (1-p_m)^{o(H)}$$\n\nNow, we determine the order $o(H)$ and defining length $\\delta(H)$ for each of the three schemas, and then calculate their resilience.\nThe given parameters are $l=16$, so $l-1=15$. The probabilities are $p_c = 0.65 = \\frac{13}{20}$ and $p_m = 0.01 = \\frac{1}{100}$.\n\n**Schema A:**\nConstrained positions: $\\{(1,1), (3,0), (7,1)\\}$.\nThe number of fixed positions is $3$, so the order is $o(A) = 3$.\nThe leftmost fixed position is at index $1$, and the rightmost is at index $7$. The defining length is $\\delta(A) = 7-1 = 6$.\nThe resilience of Schema A is:\n$$P_{surv}(A) = \\left(1 - \\frac{13}{20} \\cdot \\frac{6}{15}\\right) \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{100}\\right)^{3}$$\n$$P_{surv}(A) = \\left(1 - \\frac{13 \\cdot 6}{20 \\cdot 15}\\right) \\left(\\frac{99}{100}\\right)^{3} = \\left(1 - \\frac{78}{300}\\right) \\left(\\frac{99}{100}\\right)^{3} = \\left(1 - \\frac{13}{50}\\right) \\left(\\frac{99}{100}\\right)^{3} = \\frac{37}{50} \\left(\\frac{99}{100}\\right)^{3}$$\n\n**Schema B:**\nConstrained positions: $\\{(2,1), (6,0), (14,1)\\}$.\nThe number of fixed positions is $3$, so the order is $o(B) = 3$.\nThe leftmost fixed position is at index $2$, and the rightmost is at index $14$.

Let $K = (\\frac{99}{100})^3$.\n$P_{surv}(A) = \\frac{37}{50} K = \\frac{74}{100} K = 0.74 K$\n$P_{surv}(B) = \\frac{12}{25} K = \\frac{48}{100} K = 0.48 K$\n$P_{surv}(C) = \\frac{61}{100} \\left(\\frac{99}{100}\\right) K \\approx \\frac{60.39}{100} K = 0.6039 K$\n\nComparing the coefficients, we see that $0.74 > 0.6039 > 0.48$. Thus, the ranking of resiliences is $P_{surv}(A) > P_{surv}(C) > P_{surv}(B)$.\n\nThe highest resilience is $P_{surv}(A)$ and the lowest is $P_{surv}(B)$. The problem asks for the ratio of the highest resilience to the lowest.\n$$\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{P_{surv}(A)}{P_{surv}(B)} = \\frac{\\frac{37}{50} \\left(\\frac{99}{100}\\right)^{3}}{\\frac{12}{25} \\left(\\frac{99}{100}\\right)^{3}}$$\nThe term $\\left(\\frac{99}{100}\\right)^{3}$ cancels out, leaving:\n$$\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\frac{37}{50}}{\\frac{12}{25}} = \\frac{37}{50} \\cdot \\frac{25}{12} = \\frac{37}{2 \\cdot 25} \\cdot \\frac{25}{12} = \\frac{37}{2 \\cdot 12} = \\frac{37}{24}$$\nSince $37$ is a prime number and is not a factor of $24$, this fraction is in its simplest form.",

The population at generation $t$ contains $m(H,t)=90$ instances of $H$. Fitness-proportionate selection is used, with population mean fitness $\\bar{f}(t)=1.5$ and mean fitness of strings matching $H$ equal to $\\overline{f}(H,t)=1.8$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of a lower bound on the expected number of instances of a specific schema, $H$, in the subsequent generation of a Genetic Algorithm. This calculation is based on the principles of the Schema Theorem, which analyzes the effects of selection, crossover, and mutation on the propagation of schemata.\n\nThe problem states that we must derive the result starting from the definitions of the genetic operators. We will analyze the effect of each operator—selection, crossover, and mutation—sequentially on the number of instances of the schema $H = **1*1*$.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- String length: $l=6$.\n- Schema: $H = **1*1*$.\n- Number of instances of $H$ at generation $t$: $m(H,t)=90$.\n- Population mean fitness: $\\bar{f}(t)=1.5$.\n- Mean fitness of strings matching $H$: $\\overline{f}(H,t)=1.8$.\n- Crossover probability (single-point): $p_c=0.7$.\n- Mutation probability (per bit): $p_m=0.01$.\n\nFirst, we characterize the schema $H$:\n- The order of the schema, $o(H)$, is the number of fixed positions. For $H = **1*1*$, the fixed bits are at positions $3$ and $5$. Thus, $o(H) = 2$.\n- The defining length of the schema, $\\delta(H)$, is the distance between its first and last fixed positions. The first fixed position is $3$ and the last is $5$. Thus, $\\delta(H) = 5 - 3 = 2$.\n\n**1. Effect of Fitness-Proportionate Selection**\n\nFitness-proportionate selection increases the representation of schemata with above-average fitness. The expected number of instances of schema $H$ in the mating pool after selection, denoted $E[m'(H,t)]$, is proportional to the ratio of the schema's average fitness to the population's average fitness.\n\nStarting from the definition, the total fitness of the population is $N\\bar{f}(t)$, where $N$ is the population size. The total fitness of strings belonging to schema $H$ is $m(H,t)\\overline{f}(H,t)$. Under fitness-proportionate selection, the proportion of individuals from $H$ in the mating pool is the ratio of the total fitness of $H$-individuals to the total fitness of the population. The expected number of instances is this proportion multiplied by the population size $N$:\n$$ E[m'(H,t)] = N \\times \\frac{m(H,t)\\overline{f}(H,t)}{N\\bar{f}(t)} = m(H,t) \\frac{\\overline{f}(H,t)}{\\bar{f}(t)} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ E[m'(H,t)] = 90 \\times \\frac{1.8}{1.5} = 90 \\times 1.2 = 108 $$\nSo, after selection, we expect to have $108$ instances of schema $H$ in the mating pool.\n\n**2. Effect of Single-Point Crossover**\n\nNext, we calculate the probability that an instance of schema $H$ survives disruption by single-point crossover. A lower bound is found by considering only the disruption of existing schemata and ignoring the creation of new ones. An instance of $H$ is disrupted if it undergoes crossover (with probability $p_c$) and the crossover point falls between its defining bits.\n\nThe number of possible cut points for single-point crossover is $l-1 = 6-1 = 5$.\nThe number of cut points that fall between the first and last fixed positions of $H$ is equal to its defining length, $\\delta(H) = 2$.\nThe probability of a disruptive cut, given that crossover occurs, is $\\frac{\\delta(H)}{l-1}$.\nThe total probability of disruption for an individual schema is the probability of crossover multiplied by the conditional probability of disruption: $p_{\\text{disrupt}} = p_c \\frac{\\delta(H)}{l-1}$.\nThe probability of survival, $P_s(\\text{crossover})$, is therefore at least $1 - p_{\\text{disrupt}}$.\n$$ P_s(\\text{crossover}) \\ge 1 - p_c \\frac{\\delta(H)}{l-1} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ P_s(\\text{crossover}) \\ge 1 - 0.7 \\times \\frac{2}{6-1} = 1 - 0.7 \\times \\frac{2}{5} = 1 - 0.7 \\times 0.4 = 1 - 0.28 = 0.72 $$\n\n**3. Effect of Bitwise Mutation**\n\nFinally, we analyze the effect of mutation. A schema $H$ survives mutation if none of its $o(H)$ fixed bits are altered. The probability of mutation for a single bit is $p_m$. The probability that a single bit does *not* mutate is $1-p_m$. Since mutations are independent for each bit, the probability that all $o(H)$ fixed bits remain unchanged is $(1-p_m)^{o(H)}$. This represents a lower bound on the survival probability, as it neglects the creation of $H$ from non-$H$ strings via mutation.\n$$ P_s(\\text{mutation}) \\ge (1-p_m)^{o(H)} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ P_s(\\text{mutation}) \\ge (1 - 0.01)^{2} = (0.99)^2 = 0.9801 $$\n\n**4. Combined Lower Bound Calculation**\n\nTo obtain the lower bound on the expected number of instances of $H$ in generation $t+1$, we combine these effects multiplicatively. We start with the number of instances of $H$ at generation $t$, apply the selection multiplier, and then the survival probabilities from crossover and mutation.\n\n$$ E[m(H, t+1)] \\ge m(H, t) \\times \\frac{\\overline{f}(H,t)}{\\bar{f}(t)} \\times \\left(1 - p_c \\frac{\\delta(H)}{l-1}\\right) \\times (1-p_m)^{o(H)} $$\nLet's compute the final numerical value using the intermediate results:\n$$ E[m(H, t+1)]_{\\text{lower bound}} = (\\text{initial count}) \\times (\\text{selection effect}) \\times (\\text{crossover survival}) \\times (\\text{mutation survival}) $$\n$$ E[m(H, t+1)]_{\\text{lower bound}} = 90 \\times \\left(\\frac{1.8}{1.5}\\right) \\times (0.72) \\times (0.9801) $$\n$$ E[m(H, t+1)]_{\\text{lower bound}} = 90 \\times 1.2 \\times 0.72 \\times 0.9801 $$\n$$ E[m(H, t+1)]_{\\text{lower bound}} = 108 \\times 0.72 \\times 0.9801 $$\n$$ E[m(H, t+1)]_{\\text{lower bound}} = 77.76 \\times 0.9801 $$\n$$ E[m(H, t+1)]_{\\text{lower bound}} = 76.212576 $$\nThis is the final exact numerical value for the lower bound on the expected number of instances of schema $H$ in the next generation.",
