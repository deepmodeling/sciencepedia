            "solution": "The user wants to find the total number of accessible paths from a specific starting genotype to a specific ending genotype on a given fitness landscape.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   **Genotype space**: The set of all possible genotypes is $\\{0,1\\}^{L}$, which corresponds to the vertices of an $L$-dimensional hypercube. A genotype is a bitstring $g = (g_1, g_2, \\dots, g_L)$.\n-   **Fitness function**: The fitness of a genotype $g$ is defined by an additive model:\n    $$F(g) = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} s_{i} g_{i}$$\n-   **Fitness coefficients**: The coefficients $s_i$ are fixed constants for each locus $i$, and they are all strictly positive, i.e., $s_i \\in \\mathbb{R}_{0}$. This means $s_i  0$ for all $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, L\\}$. The contribution of each locus is independent of the genetic background (no epistasis).\n-   **Alleles**: At each locus $i$, the allele $g_i$ can be either $0$ or $1$.\n-   **Path definition**: A path is a sequence of genotypes starting at $g^{(0)} = 0^L = (0, \\dots, 0)$ and ending at $g^{(L)} = 1^L = (1, \\dots, 1)$. Each step in the sequence involves flipping exactly one coordinate from $0$ to $1$. No reversions (flips from $1$ to $0$) are allowed.\n-   **Accessibility condition**: A path is defined as accessible if the fitness strictly increases at every step along the path.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is validated against the specified criteria:\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is well-grounded in the field of evolutionary biology and complex systems modeling. The additive fitness landscape is a fundamental model (equivalent to the $K=0$ case of the Kauffman NK model) used to study evolutionary dynamics in the absence of epistasis.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly stated. It provides all necessary definitions (genotype space, fitness function, path, accessibility) and asks for a specific, calculable quantity (the total number of accessible paths). A unique solution exists and can be derived from the premises.\n-   **Objective**: The language is formal and precise. Terms like \"strictly positive\" and \"strictly increases\" are unambiguous.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed:\n1.  **Scientific/Factual Unsoundness**: No violations of scientific or mathematical principles.\n2.  **Non-Formalizable/Irrelevant**: The problem is formal and directly relevant to fitness landscapes.\n3.  **Incomplete/Contradictory Setup**: The setup is complete and self-consistent.\n4.  **Unrealistic/Infeasible**: The model is an idealization but is a standard and valid construct in theoretical biology.\n5.  **Ill-Posed/Poorly Structured**: The problem is well-structured.\n6.  **Pseudo-Profound/Trivial/Tautological**: While the solution is straightforward upon careful analysis of the premises, it requires a clear logical deduction from the given definitions, which is a valid exercise. It is not tautological.\n7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability**: The problem is a mathematical derivation, which is verifiable by logic.\n\nThe problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of the Solution\nWe are asked to find the total number of accessible paths from the genotype $0^L = (0, \\dots, 0)$ to $1^L = (1, \\dots, 1)$.\n\nFirst, let's characterize a path as defined in the problem. A path consists of a sequence of $L$ single-mutational steps, where each step flips a distinct bit from $0$ to $1$. The path starts with the genotype $g^{(0)} = 0^L$, which has $0$ ones. The first step flips one bit, resulting in a genotype $g^{(1)}$ with exactly one bit set to $1$. The second step flips another bit, resulting in a genotype $g^{(2)}$ with two bits set to $1$, and so on, until the $L$-th step flips the last remaining $0$ to a $1$, resulting in the final genotype $g^{(L)} = 1^L$.\n\nA path is therefore uniquely determined by the *order* in which the $L$ loci are mutated from $0$ to $1$. For instance, if $L=3$, one possible path is to mutate locus $2$, then locus $1$, then locus $3$. This corresponds to the sequence of genotypes:\n$g^{(0)} = (0,0,0) \\to g^{(1)} = (0,1,0) \\to g^{(2)} = (1,1,0) \\to g^{(3)} = (1,1,1)$.\nThe order of mutations is a permutation of the set of indices $\\{1, 2, \\dots, L\\}$. The total number of possible orders of $L$ distinct items is $L!$ (L factorial). Therefore, there are $L!$ distinct paths from $0^L$ to $1^L$ that satisfy the structural definition of a path.\n\nNext, we must apply the accessibility condition: fitness must strictly increase at each step. Let's analyze the change in fitness at an arbitrary step in a path. Consider a step that takes a genotype $g$ to a new genotype $g'$ by flipping the $j$-th bit from $0$ to $1$.\nThe genotype $g$ has $g_j=0$, and the genotype $g'$ has $g'_j=1$, while for all other loci $i \\neq j$, we have $g_i = g'_i$.\n\nThe fitness of $g$ is $F(g) = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} s_i g_i$.\nThe fitness of $g'$ is $F(g') = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} s_i g'_i$.\n\nThe change in fitness for this step is $\\Delta F = F(g') - F(g)$.\n$$\n\\Delta F = \\left( s_j g'_j + \\sum_{i \\neq j} s_i g'_i \\right) - \\left( s_j g_j + \\sum_{i \\neq j} s_i g_i \\right)\n$$\nSince $g'_i=g_i$ for $i \\neq j$, the sums over $i \\neq j$ cancel out:\n$$\n\\Delta F = s_j g'_j - s_j g_j = s_j(g'_j - g_j)\n$$\nBy definition of the step, $g'_j = 1$ and $g_j = 0$. So the change in fitness is:\n$$\n\\Delta F = s_j(1 - 0) = s_j\n$$\nThe accessibility condition requires that fitness strictly increases at each step, which translates to $\\Delta F  0$. This means we must have $s_j  0$ for the locus $j$ that was mutated.\n\nThe problem statement provides that for all loci $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, L\\}$, the coefficients $s_i$ are strictly positive, i.e., $s_i \\in \\mathbb{R}_{0}$. This implies $s_i  0$ for all $i$.\n\nTherefore, for any step in any path from $0^L$ to $1^L$ (which by a path's definition involves flipping a bit from $0$ to $1$), the change in fitness is equal to the positive constant $s_j$ corresponding to the mutated locus $j$. Since all $s_j$ are strictly positive, the fitness will strictly increase at every single step of any of the structurally possible paths.\n\nThis means that the accessibility constraint imposes no additional restrictions. Every path that fits the structural definition (a sequence of $L$ forward mutations) is automatically an accessible path.\n\nThe problem thus reduces to counting the total number of such paths. As established earlier, a path is uniquely defined by the permutation of the loci to be mutated. The number of permutations of $L$ distinct items is $L!$.\n\nThus, the total number of accessible paths from $0^L$ to $1^L$ is $L!$.",

It is well-posed, providing all necessary numerical values and definitions for a unique solution. The language is objective and formal. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria (e.g., it is not factually unsound, contradictory, ill-posed, or trivial).\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution**\n\n**1. Construction of the Fitness Table**\nWe use the given fitness function $F(i,j) = F_{00} + s_{1} i + s_{2} j + \\epsilon\\, i j$ and the specified constants $F_{00} = 1$, $s_{1} = \\frac{2}{5}$, $s_{2} = \\frac{3}{10}$, and $\\epsilon = -\\frac{1}{5}$ to calculate the fitness of each of the four genotypes.\n\n- For genotype $00$ ($i=0, j=0$):\n$F_{00} = F(0,0) = 1 + s_{1}(0) + s_{2}(0) + \\epsilon(0)(0) = 1$.\n\n- For genotype $10$ ($i=1, j=0$):\n$F_{10} = F(1,0) = 1 + s_{1}(1) + s_{2}(0) + \\epsilon(1)(0) = 1 + s_{1} = 1 + \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{7}{5}$.\n\n- For genotype $01$ ($i=0, j=1$):\n$F_{01} = F(0,1) = 1 + s_{1}(0) + s_{2}(1) + \\epsilon(0)(1) = 1 + s_{2} = 1 + \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{13}{10}$.\n\n- For genotype $11$ ($i=1, j=1$):\n$F_{11} = F(1,1) = 1 + s_{1}(1) + s_{2}(1) + \\epsilon(1)(1) = 1 + s_{1} + s_{2} + \\epsilon = 1 + \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{3}{10} - \\frac{1}{5} = 1 + \\frac{4}{10} + \\frac{3}{10} - \\frac{2}{10} = 1 + \\frac{5}{10} = \\frac{15}{10} = \\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nThe resulting fitness table is $\\{F_{00}, F_{10}, F_{01}, F_{11}\\} = \\{1, \\frac{7}{5}, \\frac{13}{10}, \\frac{3}{2}\\}$.\n\n**2. Verification of Magnitude Epistasis without Sign Epistasis**\nTo verify the nature of epistasis, we compute the fitness effects of single-locus substitutions on different genetic backgrounds.\n\n- **Effect of locus 1** (mutation from $0 \\to 1$ at the first locus):\n  - On the background $j=0$: The fitness change is $\\Delta F_{1\\cdot|j=0} = F_{10} - F_{00} = \\frac{7}{5} - 1 = \\frac{2}{5}$.\n  - On the background $j=1$: The fitness change is $\\Delta F_{1\\cdot|j=1} = F_{11} - F_{01} = \\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{13}{10} = \\frac{15-13}{10} = \\frac{2}{10} = \\frac{1}{5}$.\n  - The signs of the effects are $\\operatorname{sign}(\\frac{2}{5}) = +1$ and $\\operatorname{sign}(\\frac{1}{5}) = +1$. Since the signs are identical, there is no sign epistasis for locus $1$.\n\n- **Effect of locus 2** (mutation from $0 \\to 1$ at the second locus):\n  - On the background $i=0$: The fitness change is $\\Delta F_{\\cdot 1|i=0} = F_{01} - F_{00} = \\frac{13}{10} - 1 = \\frac{3}{10}$.\n  - On the background $i=1$: The fitness change is $\\Delta F_{\\cdot 1|i=1} = F_{11} - F_{10} = \\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{7}{5} = \\frac{15-14}{10} = \\frac{1}{10}$.\n  - The signs of the effects are $\\operatorname{sign}(\\frac{3}{10}) = +1$ and $\\operatorname{sign}(\\frac{1}{10}) = +1$. Since the signs are identical, there is no sign epistasis for locus $2$.\n\n- The epistasis coefficient is $\\epsilon = -\\frac{1}{5} \\neq 0$. The difference in the magnitude of single-locus effects confirms this. For locus $1$, the effect changes from $\\frac{2}{5}$ to $\\frac{1}{5}$. For locus $2$, the effect changes from $\\frac{3}{10}$ to $\\frac{1}{10}$.\n- Since $\\epsilon \\neq 0$ and there is no sign epistasis for either locus, the landscape exhibits magnitude epistasis without sign epistasis, as required to verify.\n\n**3. Determination of the Number of Local Maxima ($M$)**\nA local maximum is a genotype with fitness strictly greater than its Hamming-$1$ neighbors. The neighbors on the $Q_2$ graph are: $00 \\leftrightarrow \\{10, 01\\}$, $11 \\leftrightarrow \\{10, 01\\}$, $10 \\leftrightarrow \\{00, 11\\}$, $01 \\leftrightarrow \\{00, 11\\}$.\nThe fitness values are $F_{00}=1$, $F_{10}=\\frac{7}{5}=1.4$, $F_{01}=\\frac{13}{10}=1.3$, $F_{11}=\\frac{3}{2}=1.5$.\n\n- Genotype $00$: $F_{00}  F_{10}$ and $F_{00}  F_{01}$. Not a local maximum.\n- Genotype $10$: $F_{10}  F_{00}$ but $F_{10}  F_{11}$. Not a local maximum.\n- Genotype $01$: $F_{01}  F_{00}$ but $F_{01}  F_{11}$. Not a local maximum.\n- Genotype $11$: $F_{11}  F_{10}$ and $F_{11}  F_{01}$. This is a local maximum.\n\nThere is exactly one local maximum, which is the genotype $11$. Therefore, $M = 1$.\n\nNow, we explain why this is the same prediction as the additive baseline.\nThe additive baseline fitness is $F_{\\text{add}}(i,j) = 1 + \\frac{2}{5} i + \\frac{3}{10} j$.\n- $F_{\\text{add}, 00} = 1$.\n- $F_{\\text{add}, 10} = 1 + \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{7}{5}$.\n- $F_{\\text{add}, 01} = 1 + \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{13}{10}$.\n- $F_{\\text{add}, 11} = 1 + \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{17}{10}$.\nSince both single-locus selection coefficients are positive ($s_1 = \\frac{2}{5}  0$ and $s_2 = \\frac{3}{10}  0$), any mutation from a $0$ to a $1$ is unconditionally beneficial. This creates a smooth, single-peaked landscape where fitness increases monotonically with the number of $1$s. Thus, the additive landscape has a single global (and therefore local) maximum at genotype $11$.\n\nThe introduction of epistasis $\\epsilon$ can create new local maxima only if it is strong enough to reverse the sign of a beneficial mutation on some background, i.e., if it causes sign epistasis.\nLet's check the conditions for all single-step mutations towards the additive peak ($11$) to remain fitness-increasing:\n- $F_{10}  F_{00} \\implies s_1  0$. This is $\\frac{2}{5}  0$, which is true.\n- $F_{01}  F_{00} \\implies s_2  0$. This is $\\frac{3}{10}  0$, which is true.\n- $F_{11}  F_{10} \\implies s_2 + \\epsilon  0$. This is $\\frac{3}{10} - \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{3-2}{10} = \\frac{1}{10}  0$, which is true.\n- $F_{11}  F_{01} \\implies s_1 + \\epsilon  0$. This is $\\frac{2}{5} - \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{5}  0$, which is true.\n\nSince all single-mutant paths from $00$ to $11$ (i.e., $00 \\to 10 \\to 11$ and $00 \\to 01 \\to 11$) are strictly increasing in fitness, no genotype other than $11$ can be a local maximum. The negative epistasis $\\epsilon = -\\frac{1}{5}$ is not strong enough to overcome the positive selection coefficients ($|\\epsilon|  s_1$ and $|\\epsilon|  s_2$). Therefore, the topology of the landscape remains single-peaked, and no additional local maxima are introduced beyond the one predicted by the additive model.\n\n**4. Final Answer Formulation**\nThe problem asks for the pair consisting of the epistasis coefficient $\\epsilon$ and the local-maximum count $M$. We have found $\\epsilon = -\\frac{1}{5}$ and $M = 1$. This is reported as a single row matrix.",

Third, compute the sizes $|B(\\mathbf{m})|$ of the basins of attraction for each peak.\n- **Output Format**: A single row vector of basin sizes, ordered by the lexicographical order of the peaks $\\mathbf{m} \\in \\{0110, 1010, 1100, 1111\\}$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is a standard exercise in the theory of Complex Adaptive Systems, specifically concerning the structure of fitness landscapes. All concepts—genotype space, Hamming distance, fitness function, greedy ascent dynamics, local optima, and basins of attraction—are fundamental and well-established in evolutionary computation and related fields.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. The genotype space is finite, the fitness function is explicitly defined for all points, and the dynamic rule is deterministic and unambiguous. The inclusion of a tie-breaking rule (lexicographical order) ensures that the trajectory from any starting genotype is unique. Since fitness strictly increases along any non-terminating trajectory on a finite space, every trajectory must terminate at a fixed point of the dynamics, which in this case are the local maxima.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective mathematical language.\n4.  **Consistency and Completeness**: All necessary data (fitness values) and definitions are provided. There are no contradictions. The given fitness values are all distinct, which simplifies the application of the tie-breaking rule, as it will not be needed for ties in fitness values.\n5.  **Other Flaws**: The problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the validation criteria. It is a formal, solvable problem grounded in established scientific and mathematical principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Formal Definition of the Basin of Attraction\nLet the genotype space be $S = \\{0,1\\}^{4}$. The greedy ascent dynamics define a discrete-time map $T: S \\to S$. For any genotype $\\mathbf{x} \\in S$, let $N_(\\mathbf{x}) = \\{\\mathbf{y} \\in N(\\mathbf{x}) \\mid f(\\mathbf{y})  f(\\mathbf{x})\\}$.\n- If $N_(\\mathbf{x}) = \\emptyset$, then $\\mathbf{x}$ is a fixed point, and we define $T(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{x}$.\n- If $N_(\\mathbf{x}) \\neq \\emptyset$, let $f_{\\max}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\max_{\\mathbf{y} \\in N_(\\mathbf{x})} f(\\mathbf{y})$. Let $M(\\mathbf{x}) = \\{\\mathbf{y} \\in N_(\\mathbf x) \\mid f(\\mathbf{y}) = f_{\\max}(\\mathbf{x})\\}$. Then $T(\\mathbf{x}) = \\min_{\\text{lex}}(M(\\mathbf{x}))$, where $\\min_{\\text{lex}}$ denotes the lexicographically smallest element.\n\nA trajectory starting from $\\mathbf{x}_0 \\in S$ is a sequence $\\{\\mathbf{x}_k\\}_{k=0}^{\\infty}$ where $\\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = T(\\mathbf{x}_k)$. Since $f(\\mathbf{x}_{k+1})  f(\\mathbf{x}_k)$ if $\\mathbf{x}_k$ is not a fixed point and $S$ is finite, this sequence must converge to a fixed point, say $\\mathbf{m}$. We denote this $\\lim_{k\\to\\infty} T^k(\\mathbf{x}_0) = \\mathbf{m}$.\nA local maximum (peak) $\\mathbf{m}$ is a genotype where $f(\\mathbf{y})f(\\mathbf{m})$ for all $\\mathbf{y}\\in N(\\mathbf{m})$, which implies $N_(\\mathbf{m}) = \\emptyset$. Thus, all peaks are fixed points.\nThe basin of attraction of a peak $\\mathbf{m}$ is the set of all starting points whose trajectories terminate at $\\mathbf{m}$:\n$$B(\\mathbf{m}) = \\{\\mathbf{x} \\in S \\mid \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} T^k(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{m}\\}$$\n\n### Determination of Local Maxima\nWe identify local maxima by checking for each genotype $\\mathbf{x}$ if its fitness $f(\\mathbf{x})$ is strictly greater than the fitness of all its Hamming-$1$ neighbors.\n\n- $\\mathbf{m_1} = 0110$: $f(0110) = 11.6$.\n  Neighbors: $f(0111)=10.9$, $f(0100)=8.0$, $f(0010)=10.2$, $f(1110)=11.0$.\n  All neighbor fitnesses are less than $11.6$. Thus, $0110$ is a local maximum.\n\n- $\\mathbf{m_2} = 1010$: $f(1010) = 11.8$.\n  Neighbors: $f(1011)=9.7$, $f(1000)=9.5$, $f(1110)=11.0$, $f(0010)=10.2$.\n  All neighbor fitnesses are less than $11.8$. Thus, $1010$ is a local maximum.\n\n- $\\mathbf{m_3} = 1100$: $f(1100) = 12.0$.\n  Neighbors: $f(1101)=10.5$, $f(1110)=11.0$, $f(1000)=9.5$, $f(0100)=8.0$.\n  All neighbor fitnesses are less than $12.0$. Thus, $1100$ is a local maximum.\n\n- $\\mathbf{m_4} = 1111$: $f(1111) = 12.5$.\n  Neighbors: $f(1110)=11.0$, $f(1101)=10.5$, $f(1011)=9.7$, $f(0111)=10.9$.\n  All neighbor fitnesses are less than $12.5$. Thus, $1111$ is a local maximum.\n\nA check of other genotypes confirms they are not local maxima. For example, for $\\mathbf{x}=0000$, $f(0000)=7.0$, its neighbor $0010$ has fitness $f(0010)=10.2  7.0$.\nThe set of local maxima is $\\{0110, 1010, 1100, 1111\\}$.\n\n### Calculation of Basin Sizes\nWe determine the evolutionary path for each of the $16$ genotypes. The four peaks are fixed points, so they belong to their own basins. For the remaining $12$ genotypes, we compute the next state $T(\\mathbf{x})$.\n\n1.  $\\mathbf{x}=0000, f=7.0$. Neighbors' fitnesses are $7.8, 10.2, 8.0, 9.5$. Max is $10.2$ at $0010$. $T(0000) = 0010$.\n2.  $\\mathbf{x}=0001, f=7.8$. Improving neighbors: $0011(9.3), 0101(9.0), 1001(9.2)$. Max is $9.3$ at $0011$. $T(0001) = 0011$.\n3.  $\\mathbf{x}=0010, f=10.2$. Improving neighbors: $0110(11.6), 1010(11.8)$. Max is $11.8$ at $1010$. $T(0010) = 1010$.\n4.  $\\mathbf{x}=0011, f=9.3$. Improving neighbors: $0010(10.2), 0111(10.9), 1011(9.7)$. Max is $10.9$ at $0111$. $T(0011) = 0111$.\n5.  $\\mathbf{x}=0100, f=8.0$. Improving neighbors: $0101(9.0), 0110(11.6), 1100(12.0)$. Max is $12.0$ at $1100$. $T(0100) = 1100$.\n6.  $\\mathbf{x}=0101, f=9.0$. Improving neighbors: $0111(10.9), 1101(10.5)$. Max is $10.9$ at $0111$. $T(0101) = 0111$.\n7.  $\\mathbf{x}=0111, f=10.9$. Improving neighbors: $0110(11.6), 1111(12.5)$. Max is $12.5$ at $1111$. $T(0111) = 1111$.\n8.  $\\mathbf{x}=1000, f=9.5$. Improving neighbors: $1010(11.8), 1100(12.0)$. Max is $12.0$ at $1100$. $T(1000) = 1100$.\n9.  $\\mathbf{x}=1001, f=9.2$. Improving neighbors: $1000(9.5), 1011(9.7), 1101(10.5)$. Max is $10.5$ at $1101$. $T(1001) = 1101$.\n10. $\\mathbf{x}=1011, f=9.7$. Improving neighbors: $1010(11.8), 1111(12.5)$. Max is $12.5$ at $1111$. $T(1011) = 1111$.\n11. $\\mathbf{x}=1101, f=10.5$. Improving neighbors: $1100(12.0), 1111(12.5)$. Max is $12.5$ at $1111$. $T(1101) = 1111$.\n12. $\\mathbf{x}=1110, f=11.0$. Improving neighbors: $1111(12.5), 1100(12.0), 1010(11.8)$. Max is $12.5$ at $1111$. $T(1110) = 1111$.\n\nWe now assemble the trajectories to determine the basin for each peak.\n\n-   **Basin of attraction for $\\mathbf{m_1} = 0110$**:\n    The genotype $0110$ is a peak, so it is in its own basin. No other genotype maps to $0110$.\n    $B(0110) = \\{0110\\}$.\n    The size is $|B(0110)| = 1$.\n\n-   **Basin of attraction for $\\mathbf{m_2} = 1010$**:\n    $1010$ is in its own basin.\n    $T(0010) = 1010$.\n    $T(0000) = 0010$, so $T^2(0000) = T(0010) = 1010$.\n    $B(1010) = \\{0000, 0010, 1010\\}$.\n    The size is $|B(1010)| = 3$.\n\n-   **Basin of attraction for $\\mathbf{m_3} = 1100$**:\n    $1100$ is in its own basin.\n    $T(0100) = 1100$.\n    $T(1000) = 1100$.\n    $B(1100) = \\{0100, 1000, 1100\\}$.\n    The size is $|B(1100)| = 3$.\n\n-   **Basin of attraction for $\\mathbf{m_4} = 1111$**:\n    $1111$ is in its own basin.\n    The following genotypes map directly to $1111$: $\\{0111, 1011, 1101, 1110\\}$.\n    Genotypes that map to these are:\n    $T(0011) = 0111 \\to 1111$.\n    $T(0101) = 0111 \\to 1111$.\n    $T(1001) = 1101 \\to 1111$.\n    Finally, $T(0001) = 0011 \\to 0111 \\to 1111$.\n    Collecting all genotypes:\n    $B(1111) = \\{1111, 0111, 1011, 1101, 1110, 0011, 0101, 1001, 0001\\}$.\n    The size is $|B(1111)| = 9$.\n\nAs a check, the sum of a basin sizes is $1 + 3 + 3 + 9 = 16$, which is the total number of genotypes in the space. The basins partition the space, as expected for a deterministic dynamic.\n\nThe final answer is the vector of basin sizes, ordered by the lexicographical order of the peaks $\\{0110, 1010, 1100, 1111\\}$. The sizes are $|B(0110)|=1$, $|B(1010)|=3$, $|B(1100)|=3$, and $|B(1111)|=9$.\nThe resulting vector is $(1, 3, 3, 9)$.",
