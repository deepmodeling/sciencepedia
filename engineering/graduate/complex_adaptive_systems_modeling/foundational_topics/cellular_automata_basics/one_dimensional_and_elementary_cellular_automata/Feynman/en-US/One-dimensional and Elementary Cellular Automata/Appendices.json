            "problem": "A one-dimensional elementary cellular automaton consists of a line of cells, where each cell can be in one of two states: active (1) or inactive (0). The state of each cell at a time step $t+1$ is determined by a fixed rule based on the states of itself and its immediate left and right neighbors at time step $t$. The group of these three cells is called the neighborhood.\n\nThere are $2^3=8$ possible configurations for a neighborhood. The behavior of an elementary cellular automaton is completely specified by an 8-bit binary string, where each bit corresponds to the output state (0 or 1) for one of the 8 neighborhood configurations. By convention, these configurations are ordered from `111`, `110`, `101`, down to `000`. The corresponding 8-bit output string is then interpreted as a binary number to yield the automaton's Wolfram rule number, an integer from 0 to 255.\n\nConsider a specific elementary cellular automaton designed to detect local singularity. The rule for this automaton is as follows: a cell becomes active in the next time step if and only if exactly one cell in its 3-cell neighborhood (left, center, right) was active in the current time step.\n\nDetermine the Wolfram rule number that corresponds to this behavior.",

Therefore the outputs are $0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0$.

            "solution": "We will first derive the general algorithm and prove its correctness. Then, we will apply it to the specific case of Rule $110$.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Preimage Counting Algorithm\n\nA configuration of the one-dimensional Elementary Cellular Automaton (ECA) on a ring of circumference $L$ is a binary sequence $x = (x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_{L-1})$ where $x_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and indices are considered modulo $L$. The dynamics are governed by a local update rule $f:\\{0,1\\}^3 \\to \\{0,1\\}$. A configuration $x$ is a preimage of a configuration $w = (w_0, w_1, \\dots, w_{L-1})$ if, for every site $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, L-1\\}$, the following condition holds:\n$$w_i = f(x_{i-1}, x_i, x_{i+1})$$\n\nThe core of the problem is to count the number of such configurations $x$ for a given $w$. We will recast this as a path counting problem on the order-$2$ de Bruijn graph over the binary alphabet, $G$.\n\nThe vertices of $G$ are the four binary words of length $2$: $V = \\{00, 01, 10, 11\\}$. A directed edge exists from a vertex $uv$ to a vertex $vw$ for any $u,v,w \\in \\{0,1\\}$. This edge represents the neighborhood $uvw$.\n\n**Bijection between Configurations and Closed Walks:**\n\nLet us establish a bijection between configurations on the ring and closed walks of length $L$ in $G$.\nGiven a configuration $x = (x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_{L-1})$, we can define a sequence of $L$ vertices in $G$ as $V_i = (x_{i-1}, x_i)$ for $i=0, \\dots, L-1$. Note that due to the periodic boundary conditions, $x_{-1} = x_{L-1}$.\nThe sequence of vertices is $P = (V_0, V_1, \\dots, V_{L-1})$. Let's examine the transition from $V_i$ to $V_{i+1}$ (with $V_L = V_0$). We have $V_i = (x_{i-1}, x_i)$ and $V_{i+1} = (x_i, x_{i+1})$. The last symbol of $V_i$ is $x_i$, which is the first symbol of $V_{i+1}$. By the definition of the de Bruijn graph, there is a directed edge from $V_i$ to $V_{i+1}$. This holds for all $i=0, \\dots, L-2$. For the final step, we consider the transition from $V_{L-1} = (x_{L-2}, x_{L-1})$ to $V_0 = (x_{L-1}, x_0)$. The last symbol of $V_{L-1}$ is $x_{L-1}$, which is the first symbol of $V_0$. Thus, there is an edge from $V_{L-1}$ to $V_0$.\nThe sequence of vertices $V_0 \\to V_1 \\to \\dots \\to V_{L-1} \\to V_0$ constitutes a closed walk of length $L$ in $G$.\n\nConversely, given any closed walk of length $L$ in $G$, $P = (S_0 \\to S_1 \\to \\dots \\to S_{L-1} \\to S_0)$, where each $S_i$ is a vertex, we can construct a unique configuration $x$. Let $S_i = (u_i, v_i)$. The edge from $S_i$ to $S_{i+1}=(u_{i+1}, v_{i+1})$ implies $v_i = u_{i+1}$. Let us define the configuration by $x_i = v_i$ for $i=0, \\dots, L-1$. This implies $u_{i+1} = x_i$. Then $S_{i+1} = (x_i, x_{i+1})$ for $i=0, \\dots, L-2$. We also have $S_i = (u_i, v_i) = (u_i, x_i)$. From the edge condition $v_{i-1} = u_i$, we get $x_{i-1} = u_i$. Therefore, $S_i = (x_{i-1}, x_i)$ for $i=1, \\dots, L-1$. For $i=0$, $S_0 = (u_0, v_0) = (u_0, x_0)$. The closure of the walk means there's an edge from $S_{L-1}=(x_{L-2}, x_{L-1})$ to $S_0=(u_0, x_0)$, which requires $x_{L-1} = u_0$. Thus, $S_0 = (x_{L-1}, x_0)$. The constructed sequence $x$ is consistent and forms a valid configuration on the ring.\nThis establishes a bijection between the set of configurations of length $L$ on a ring and the set of closed walks of length $L$ in the order-$2$ de Bruijn graph.\n\n**Incorporating the ECA Rule:**\n\nA configuration $x$ is a preimage of $w$ if $w_i = f(x_{i-1}, x_i, x_{i+1})$ for all $i$. The neighborhood $(x_{i-1}, x_i, x_{i+1})$ corresponds to the edge from vertex $V_i = (x_{i-1}, x_i)$ to $V_{i+1} = (x_i, x_{i+1})$ in the walk defined by $x$. The ECA rule $f$ assigns a label, $f(x_{i-1}, x_i, x_{i+1})$, to this edge. The preimage condition thus translates to a constraint on the labels of the edges in the corresponding closed walk. The label of the $i$-th edge in the walk, $V_i \\to V_{i+1}$, must be equal to $w_i$.\n\nTherefore, counting the preimages of $w$ is equivalent to counting the number of closed walks of length $L$, $V_0 \\to V_1 \\to \\dots \\to V_{L-1} \\to V_0$, such that the sequence of edge labels is precisely $(w_0, w_1, \\dots, w_{L-1})$.\n\n**Linear Algebraic Formulation:**\n\nThis constrained path-counting problem can be solved using linear algebra. Let the vertices of $G$ be indexed from $j=1$ to $4$. We define two label-dependent adjacency matrices, $A^{(0)}$ and $A^{(1)}$, of size $4 \\times 4$.\nThe matrix $A^{(b)}$, for $b \\in \\{0,1\\}$, is defined as:\n$$(A^{(b)})_{jk} = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if there is an edge from vertex } j \\text{ to } k \\text{ with label } b \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$$\nThe number of paths of length $L$ from a vertex $j$ to a vertex $k$ with a specific sequence of edge labels $(w_0, w_1, \\dots, w_{L-1})$ is given by the $(j,k)$-th entry of the matrix product:\n$$M = A^{(w_0)} A^{(w_1)} \\dots A^{(w_{L-1})}$$\nWe are interested in closed walks, which start and end at the same vertex. The number of such walks starting and ending at vertex $j$ is the diagonal entry $M_{jj}$. The total number of such closed walks, summed over all possible starting vertices, is the trace of the matrix $M$.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Enumerate the vertices of the order-2 de Bruijn graph: $v_1=00, v_2=01, v_3=10, v_4=11$.\n2.  For the given ECA rule $f$, construct the two $4 \\times 4$ matrices $A^{(0)}$ and $A^{(1)}$.\n3.  For the target word $w=(w_0, w_1, \\dots, w_{L-1})$, compute the matrix product $M = \\prod_{i=0}^{L-1} A^{(w_i)}$.\n4.  The number of preimages is $\\mathrm{Tr}(M) = \\sum_{j=1}^4 M_{jj}$.\n\nThis algorithm provides an exact count in a closed form computable using finite-dimensional linear algebra, as required. The proof of correctness follows from the established bijection and the standard interpretation of matrix products for counting paths in directed graphs.\n\n### Part 2: Application to Rule 110\n\nWe now apply this algorithm to find the number of preimages of $w=10110$ for Rule $110$ on a ring of size $L=5$.\n\n**1. System Parameters:**\n- Rule $110$: $f(111)=0, f(110)=1, f(101)=1, f(100)=0, f(011)=1, f(010)=1, f(001)=1, f(000)=0$.\n- Ring circumference: $L=5$.\n- Target word: $w = (w_0,w_1,w_2,w_3,w_4) = (1,0,1,1,0)$.\n\n**2. Constructing $A^{(0)}$ and $A^{(1)}$ for Rule 110:**\nThe vertices are $v_1=00$, $v_2=01$, $v_3=10$, $v_4=11$. The edges and their labels under Rule $110$ are:\n- $v_1 \\to v_1$ (neighborhood $000$): $f(000)=0$\n- $v_1 \\to v_2$ (neighborhood $001$): $f(001)=1$\n- $v_2 \\to v_3$ (neighborhood $010$): $f(010)=1$\n- $v_2 \\to v_4$ (neighborhood $011$): $f(011)=1$\n- $v_3 \\to v_1$ (neighborhood $100$): $f(100)=0$\n- $v_3 \\to v_2$ (neighborhood $101$): $f(101)=1$\n- $v_4 \\to v_3$ (neighborhood $110$): $f(110)=1$\n- $v_4 \\to v_4$ (neighborhood $111$): $f(111)=0$\n\nFrom this, we construct the matrices $A^{(0)}$ and $A^{(1)}$:\n$$\nA^{(0)} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\quad\nA^{(1)} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n**3.
