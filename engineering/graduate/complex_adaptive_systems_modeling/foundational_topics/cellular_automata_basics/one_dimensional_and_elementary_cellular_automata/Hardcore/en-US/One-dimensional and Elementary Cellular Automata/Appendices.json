Give your final answer (the attractor period) as an exact integer.",
            "solution": "The problem is validated as being scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard problem in the study of linear cellular automata over finite fields. The problem statement is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities.\n\n(a) We begin by defining the global update rule for the one-dimensional elementary cellular automaton Rule $90$ on a ring of size $n$. The state of the automaton at time $t$ is represented by a vector $\\mathbf{s}(t) = (s_{0}(t), s_{1}(t), \\dots, s_{n-1}(t))^{T} \\in \\mathbb{F}_{2}^{n}$. The local update rule is given by $s_{i}(t+1) = s_{i-1}(t) + s_{i+1}(t)$ for $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$, where all arithmetic is in the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_{2}$ and indices are taken modulo $n$.\n\nThe global dynamics can be expressed as a linear transformation $\\mathbf{s}(t+1) = A \\mathbf{s}(t)$, where $A$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix over $\\mathbb{F}_{2}$. Let's express the components of $\\mathbf{s}(t+1)$:\n$$s_{0}(t+1) = s_{n-1}(t) + s_{1}(t)$$\n$$s_{1}(t+1) = s_{0}(t) + s_{2}(t)$$\n$$\\vdots$$\n$$s_{i}(t+1) = s_{i-1}(t) + s_{i+1}(t)$$\n$$\\vdots$$\n$$s_{n-1}(t+1) = s_{n-2}(t) + s_{0}(t)$$\n\nWe can decompose this transformation. Let $L$ be the left-shift permutation matrix and $S$ be the right-shift permutation matrix. The components of the updated state vector can be written as $s_{i}(t+1) = (S\\mathbf{s}(t))_i + (L\\mathbf{s}(t))_i$. Since matrix addition is defined component-wise, we can write the global update vector as:\n$$\\mathbf{s}(t+1) = S \\mathbf{s}(t) + L \\mathbf{s}(t) = (S+L) \\mathbf{s}(t)$$\nThus, the global update matrix is $A = S+L$. The matrices $L$ and $S$ are circulant and are inverses of each other ($L = S^{-1}$). Any circulant matrix can be written as a polynomial in a fundamental shift matrix (e.g., $S$). Since $S$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix, $S^n = I$, so $S^{-1} = S^{n-1}$. Therefore, the update matrix is $A = S + S^{-1}$, or equivalently, $A = S + S^{n-1}$.\n\n(b) The set of $n \\times n$ circulant matrices over $\\mathbb{F}_{2}$ forms an algebra isomorphic to the group algebra $\\mathbb{F}_{2}[\\mathbb{Z}_{n}]$, which is in turn isomorphic to the quotient ring $\\mathbb{F}_{2}[x]/(x^{n}-1)$. The matrix $S$ corresponds to the indeterminate $x$. Under this isomorphism, the matrix $A = S + S^{-1}$ corresponds to the polynomial $p(x) = x + x^{-1} = x + x^{n-1}$.\n\nThe eigenvalues of a circulant matrix are given by the evaluation of its corresponding polynomial at the $n$-th roots of unity. These roots of unity may not lie in $\\mathbb{F}_{2}$, but in a suitable finite extension field $\\mathrm{GF}(2^{r})$. Let $\\mathrm{GF}(2^{r})$ be the splitting field for the polynomial $x^{n}-1$ over $\\mathbb{F}_{2}$, and let $\\omega \\in \\mathrm{GF}(2^{r})$ be a primitive $n$-th root of unity. The set of all $n$-th roots of unity in this field is $\\{\\omega^{k} \\mid k = 0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$.\n\nThe eigenvalues of $A$ are the values $\\lambda_{k} = p(\\omega^{k})$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$. Substituting $\\omega^{k}$ into the polynomial $p(x) = x + x^{-1}$, we get:\n$$\\lambda_{k} = \\omega^{k} + (\\omega^{k})^{-1} = \\omega^{k} + \\omega^{-k}$$\nThis confirms the expression for the eigenvalues of $A$ given in the problem statement. The matrix $A$ is diagonalizable over $\\mathrm{GF}(2^{r})$, and its diagonal form consists of these eigenvalues.\n\n(c) We now specialize to the case where $n = 2^{m}$ for some integer $m \\geq 1$. We are working in a field of characteristic $2$. The Frobenius endomorphism states that for any elements $a,b$ in a ring of characteristic $2$, $(a+b)^{2} = a^{2} + b^{2}$. By induction, this generalizes to $(a+b)^{2^{j}} = a^{2^{j}} + b^{2^{j}}$ for any integer $j \\geq 1$.\n\nLet's analyze the powers of the eigenvalues $\\lambda_{k}$ using this property.\n$$\\lambda_{k}^{2} = (\\omega^{k} + \\omega^{-k})^{2} = (\\omega^{k})^{2} + (\\omega^{-k})^{2} = \\omega^{2k} + \\omega^{-2k} = \\lambda_{2k \\pmod{n}}$$\nGeneralizing this by repeated application:\n$$\\lambda_{k}^{2^{j}} = (\\lambda_{k})^{2 \\cdot 2^{j-1}} = (\\lambda_{2k})^{2^{j-1}} = \\dots = \\lambda_{k \\cdot 2^{j} \\pmod{n}}$$\nLet's choose $j=m$. Since $n = 2^{m}$, we have:\n$$\\lambda_{k}^{2^{m}} = \\lambda_{k \\cdot 2^{m}} = \\lambda_{kn}$$\nThe indices of the eigenvalues are considered modulo $n$. Thus, $kn$ is equivalent to $k \\cdot 0 = 0$. So we have:\n$$\\lambda_{k}^{n} = \\lambda_{k}^{2^{m}} = \\lambda_{0}$$\nNow, we compute the eigenvalue $\\lambda_{0}$:\n$$\\lambda_{0} = \\omega^{0} + \\omega^{-0} = 1 + 1 = 0 \\quad (\\text{in } \\mathbb{F}_{2})$$\nTherefore, for any $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$, we have $\\lambda_{k}^{n} = \\lambda_{k}^{2^{m}} = 0$. This means that every eigenvalue of $A$ is nilpotent.\n\nSince $A$ is diagonalizable over $\\mathrm{GF}(2^{r})$, there exists an invertible matrix $P$ such that $A = PDP^{-1}$, where $D = \\mathrm{diag}(\\lambda_{0}, \\lambda_{1}, \\dots, \\lambda_{n-1})$.\nThen, for any power $j$, $A^{j} = PD^{j}P^{-1}$. Let's compute $A^{n} = A^{2^{m}}$:\n$$A^{n} = P D^{n} P^{-1} = P \\, \\mathrm{diag}(\\lambda_{0}^{n}, \\lambda_{1}^{n}, \\dots, \\lambda_{n-1}^{n}) \\, P^{-1}$$\nSince $\\lambda_{k}^{n} = 0$ for all $k$, we have:\n$$A^{n} = P \\, \\mathrm{diag}(0, 0, \\dots, 0) \\, P^{-1} = P \\mathbf{0} P^{-1} = \\mathbf{0}$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{0}$ is the zero matrix. Thus, the matrix $A$ is nilpotent with nilpotency index at most $n = 2^{m}$.\n\nThe state of the system evolves according to $\\mathbf{s}(t) = A^{t}\\mathbf{s}(0)$. For any time $t \\geq n = 2^{m}$, we can write $t = n+q$ for some $q \\geq 0$. Then:\n$$\\mathbf{s}(t) = A^{t}\\mathbf{s}(0) = A^{n+q}\\mathbf{s}(0) = A^{q} A^{n} \\mathbf{s}(0) = A^{q} \\mathbf{0} \\mathbf{s}(0) = \\mathbf{0}$$\nThis shows that for any initial configuration $\\mathbf{s}(0)$, the system will reach the all-zero state $\\mathbf{s} = \\mathbf{0}$ in at most $n = 2^{m}$ time steps. The all-zero state is a fixed point of the dynamics, since $A\\mathbf{0} = \\mathbf{0}$.\n\nAn attractor cycle is a periodic trajectory in the state space. Since every initial configuration is driven to the unique fixed point $\\mathbf{0}$, the only attractor in the system is the set $\\{\\mathbf{0}\\}$. A fixed point is a cycle of period $1$. Therefore, the eventual temporal period attained on the limit cycle is $1$.",
