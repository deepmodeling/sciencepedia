            "problem": "Consider a Susceptible–Infectious–Recovered (SIR) model on a two-type contact network in which the agents are partitioned into two types, labeled type $A$ and type $B$. The system has three components: agent states (susceptible, infectious, recovered), pairwise interactions (contacts between agents that can lead to transmission), and an external environment that modulates the interaction structure over time. The environment is modeled as a two-state continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC), $Z(t) \\in \\{D, W\\}$, with transition rate from the dry state $D$ to the wet state $W$ equal to $\\alpha$, and from $W$ to $D$ equal to $\\beta$. Specifically, the rates are $\\alpha = 3$ and $\\beta = 1$, with time measured in days.\n\nAgents of type $i \\in \\{A,B\\}$ generate contacts to type $j \\in \\{A,B\\}$ according to independent Poisson processes whose rates depend on the environment state $Z(t)$. The per-contact transmission probability is $\\tau$, assumed identical across types. Infectious agents recover at constant rates: type $A$ recovers at rate $\\gamma_A$ and type $B$ at rate $\\gamma_B$. There are no births or deaths and the infectious period is exponentially distributed for each type.\n\nAll parameters are constant and known:\n- Per-contact transmission probability: $\\tau = 0.04$.\n- Recovery rates: $\\gamma_A = 0.5$ and $\\gamma_B = 0.25$ (per day).\n- Environment-dependent contact rates (per day) are given by the $2 \\times 2$ matrices $C^{D}$ and $C^{W}$, where the $(i,j)$ entry is the rate at which a single infectious agent of type $i$ initiates potentially infectious contacts to agents of type $j$ when the environment is in state $D$ or $W$, respectively:\n$$\nC^{D} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n4  2 \\\\\n1  3\n\\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad\nC^{W} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n3  5 \\\\\n2  8\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n\nAssume the environment switches much faster than the epidemic dynamics so that the system experiences an effectively averaged contact process induced by the stationary distribution of $Z(t)$. Work from first principles: begin at the disease-free equilibrium where all agents are susceptible, use the definitions of the SIR process, Poisson contact generation, and exponential recovery, and carefully justify the averaging over the environment due to timescale separation. Then, compute the basic reproduction number $R_0$ of this two-type system in the fast-switching limit. Express your final numerical answer for $R_0$ with no units and round to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "**Step 1: Calculate the Stationary Distribution of the Environment**\nThe problem states that the environment switches between a dry state ($D$) and a wet state ($W$) with rates $\\alpha=3$ from $D \\to W$ and $\\beta=1$ from $W \\to D$. Let $\\pi_D$ and $\\pi_W$ be the stationary probabilities of being in the dry and wet states, respectively. At steady state, the flow of probability between states must balance:\n$$ \\pi_D \\alpha = \\pi_W \\beta $$\nSubstituting the given rates, we have $3\\pi_D = 1\\pi_W$. We also know that the probabilities must sum to one: $\\pi_D + \\pi_W = 1$. Substituting $\\pi_W = 3\\pi_D$ into the normalization equation gives:\n$$ \\pi_D + 3\\pi_D = 1 \\implies 4\\pi_D = 1 \\implies \\pi_D = 0.25 $$\nFrom this, we find $\\pi_W = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Averaged Contact Rate Matrix**\nThe assumption of a fast-switching environment means that over the infectious period of any individual, the contact rates effectively average out. The effective contact rate matrix, $\\bar{C}$, is the average of the environment-specific matrices weighted by their stationary probabilities:\n$$ \\bar{C} = \\pi_D C^D + \\pi_W C^W $$\n$$ \\bar{C} = 0.25 \\begin{pmatrix} 4  2 \\\\ 1  3 \\end{pmatrix} + 0.75 \\begin{pmatrix} 3  5 \\\\ 2  8 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\bar{C} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0.5 \\\\ 0.25  0.75 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 2.25  3.75 \\\\ 1.5  6 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3.25  4.25 \\\\ 1.75  6.75 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nHere, $\\bar{C}_{ij}$ is the average rate at which an infectious agent of type $i$ contacts agents of type $j$.\n\n**Step 3: Construct the Next-Generation Matrix (NGM)**\nThe basic reproduction number, $R_0$, is the spectral radius of the next-generation matrix, $G$. The entry $G_{ij}$ is defined as the expected number of new infections of type $i$ produced by a single infectious individual of type $j$ introduced into a fully susceptible population.\nThis is calculated as:\n$G_{ij} = (\\text{rate of producing new infections in type } i \\text{ from a type } j \\text{ case}) \\times (\\text{average duration of infectiousness of a type } j \\text{ case})$\nThe rate at which a single infectious agent of type $j$ infects susceptible agents of type $i$ is $\\tau \\bar{C}_{ji}$. The average infectious period for a type $j$ agent is $1/\\gamma_j$. Thus:\n$$ G_{ij} = \\frac{\\tau \\bar{C}_{ji}}{\\gamma_j} $$\nLet type $1=A$ and type $2=B$. The NGM is:\n$$ G = \\begin{pmatrix} G_{11}  G_{12} \\\\ G_{21}  G_{22} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\tau \\bar{C}_{11}}{\\gamma_1}  \\frac{\\tau \\bar{C}_{21}}{\\gamma_2} \\\\ \\frac{\\tau \\bar{C}_{12}}{\\gamma_1}  \\frac{\\tau \\bar{C}_{22}}{\\gamma_2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nUsing the parameters $\\tau=0.04$, $\\gamma_A=0.5$, $\\gamma_B=0.25$, and the matrix $\\bar{C}$:\n$$ G_{11} = \\frac{0.04 \\times 3.25}{0.5} = 0.26 $$\n$$ G_{12} = \\frac{0.04 \\times 1.75}{0.25} = 0.28 $$\n$$ G_{21} = \\frac{0.04 \\times 4.25}{0.5} = 0.34 $$\n$$ G_{22} = \\frac{0.04 \\times 6.75}{0.25} = 1.08 $$\nSo, the next-generation matrix is:\n$$ G = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.26  0.28 \\\\ 0.34  1.08 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Basic Reproduction Number $R_0$**\n$R_0$ is the spectral radius (largest eigenvalue) of $G$. We find the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(G - \\lambda I) = 0$.\n$$ \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 0.26 - \\lambda  0.28 \\\\ 0.34  1.08 - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0 $$\n$$ (0.26 - \\lambda)(1.08 - \\lambda) - (0.28)(0.34) = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda^2 - (0.26 + 1.08)\\lambda + (0.26)(1.08) - 0.0952 = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda^2 - 1.34\\lambda + 0.2808 - 0.0952 = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda^2 - 1.34\\lambda + 0.1856 = 0 $$\nUsing the quadratic formula $\\lambda = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{1.34 \\pm \\sqrt{(-1.34)^2 - 4(1)(0.1856)}}{2} = \\frac{1.34 \\pm \\sqrt{1.7956 - 0.7424}}{2} $$\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{1.34 \\pm \\sqrt{1.0532}}{2} \\approx \\frac{1.34 \\pm 1.02626}{2} $$\nThe two eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 \\approx \\frac{1.34 + 1.02626}{2} \\approx 1.18313$ and $\\lambda_2 \\approx \\frac{1.34 - 1.02626}{2} \\approx 0.15687$.\nThe basic reproduction number $R_0$ is the larger of these two values.\n$$ R_0 \\approx 1.18313 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $R_0 = 1.183$.",

            "problem": "Consider a single-species reaction–diffusion system modeling the density $u(x,t)$ on a bounded one-dimensional habitat $[0,L]$, where $L0$. The environment consists of two habitat edges at $x=0$ and $x=L$ separating the habitat from a surrounding matrix. Assume local mass balance and Fickian diffusion hold: the population flux $J(x,t)$ obeys $J=-D\\,\\partial_x u$, with diffusion coefficient $D0$, and the within-habitat population dynamics is governed by a smooth reaction term $f(u)$ with $f(0)=0$ and $f^{\\prime}(0)=r0$. The governing Partial Differential Equation (PDE) on $x\\in(0,L)$ is therefore $\\partial_t u=-\\partial_x J+f(u)$.\n\nEdges can be idealized as either perfectly inhospitable (absorbing) or perfectly impermeable (reflecting). In the absorbing case, any individual that reaches the boundary is removed by the surrounding matrix; in the reflecting case, there is no exchange across the boundary.\n\nDefine mathematically consistent boundary conditions for the two cases and, using only conservation, Fick’s law, and linearization about the extinction state $u\\equiv 0$, deduce how the persistence threshold depends on $D$, $r$, and $L$. Here, “persistence” means that small positive perturbations of $u\\equiv 0$ grow initially in time rather than decay. You may use that the principal eigenvalue of the negative Laplacian on $[0,L]$ with absorbing edges is strictly positive, while with reflecting edges it is zero.\n\nSelect all statements that are correct.\n\nA. Absorbing edges correspond to imposing $u(0,t)=u(L,t)=0$, and reflecting edges correspond to imposing $\\partial_x u(0,t)=\\partial_x u(L,t)=0$. Linearizing at $u\\equiv 0$ yields a threshold of the form $r-D\\,\\lambda_10$, where $\\lambda_1$ is the principal eigenvalue of $-\\partial_{xx}$ with the corresponding boundary condition. Therefore, under reflecting edges $\\lambda_1=0$ and any $r0$ leads to initial growth, whereas under absorbing edges $\\lambda_10$ and sufficiently small $r$ or large $D$ prevent persistence.\n\nB. Under reflecting edges on $[0,L]$, the principal eigenvalue equals $\\pi^2/L^2$, so the persistence threshold $rD\\,\\pi^2/L^2$ is identical to that under absorbing edges.\n\nC. On $[0,L]$ with absorbing edges, the persistence condition is equivalent to $L\\pi\\sqrt{D/r}$.\n\nD. Under absorbing edges, increasing $D$ facilitates persistence because stronger diffusion spreads the population and reduces local depletion, thereby lowering the linear threshold.\n\nE. With reflecting edges and a logistic nonlinearity $f(u)=r\\,u\\,(1-u/K)$ with $K0$, any nontrivial, nonnegative initial condition persists and tends toward a positive spatially uniform equilibrium, whereas with absorbing edges there exists a critical habitat length $L_c0$ below which all solutions go extinct.",
            "solution": "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct statements.\n\n**1. Formulating the Model and Boundary Conditions**\nThe governing PDE is $\\partial_t u = D\\,\\partial_{xx} u + f(u)$ for $x \\in (0, L)$.\n- **Reflecting edges**: \"Perfectly impermeable\" means the population flux $J = -D\\,\\partial_x u$ is zero at the boundaries. This gives the zero-flux or Neumann boundary conditions: $\\partial_x u(0,t) = \\partial_x u(L,t) = 0$.\n- **Absorbing edges**: \"Perfectly inhospitable\" means the population density is zero at the boundaries. This gives the Dirichlet boundary conditions: $u(0,t) = u(L,t) = 0$.\n\n**2. Deriving the Persistence Threshold**\nTo determine if a small perturbation around the extinction state $u \\equiv 0$ grows, we linearize the PDE. Since $f(0)=0$ and $f'(0)=r$, for small $u$, we have $f(u) \\approx ru$. The linearized PDE is:\n$$ \\partial_t u = D\\,\\partial_{xx} u + r u $$\nA solution of the form $u(x,t) = e^{\\sigma t}\\phi(x)$ will grow if its growth rate $\\sigma$ is positive. Substituting this form into the equation gives $\\sigma \\phi = D \\phi'' + r\\phi$, which can be rearranged to the eigenvalue problem $-D\\phi'' = (r-\\sigma)\\phi$. The stability is determined by the growth rate of the principal (most unstable) mode, which corresponds to the principal eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$ of the negative Laplacian operator $-\\partial_{xx}$. The growth rate of this mode is $\\sigma_1 = r - D\\lambda_1$. Persistence requires $\\sigma_1 > 0$, or:\n$$ r > D\\lambda_1 $$\n\n**3. Evaluating Options based on the Threshold**\n\n*   **For Reflecting (Neumann) Edges:** The principal eigenvalue of $-\\partial_{xx}$ is $\\lambda_1 = 0$. The persistence condition becomes $r > D \\cdot 0 \\implies r > 0$. Since the problem states $r>0$, persistence is always possible.\n*   **For Absorbing (Dirichlet) Edges:** The principal eigenvalue of $-\\partial_{xx}$ on $[0,L]$ is $\\lambda_1 = (\\pi/L)^2$. The persistence condition becomes $r > D(\\pi/L)^2$. This creates a trade-off between the intrinsic growth rate $r$, the diffusion rate $D$, and the habitat size $L$.\n\nNow we evaluate each statement:\n\n**A. Correct.** This statement accurately identifies the mathematical forms of the boundary conditions. It correctly states the persistence threshold is $r - D\\lambda_1 > 0$. It then correctly applies this to both cases: for reflecting edges, $\\lambda_1 = 0$, so any $r>0$ allows persistence; for absorbing edges, $\\lambda_1 > 0$, so persistence is conditional on the parameters.\n\n**B. Incorrect.** This statement incorrectly claims that the principal eigenvalue for reflecting edges is $\\pi^2/L^2$. This value corresponds to absorbing edges. For reflecting edges, the principal eigenvalue is 0.\n\n**C. Correct.** For absorbing edges, the persistence condition is $r > D(\\pi/L)^2$. Rearranging this inequality for $L$ gives:\n$$ L^2 > D\\pi^2/r \\implies L > \\pi\\sqrt{D/r} $$\nThis statement is a correct algebraic manipulation of the persistence threshold. It defines a \"critical patch size\" required for the population to survive when faced with hostile boundaries.\n\n**D. Incorrect.** The persistence condition for absorbing edges is $r > D(\\pi/L)^2$, or equivalently $D  r(L/\\pi)^2$. Increasing the diffusion coefficient $D$ makes this condition *harder* to satisfy. A higher diffusion rate leads to faster loss of individuals at the hostile boundaries, thus hindering, not facilitating, persistence.\n\n**E. Correct.** This statement describes the long-term nonlinear behavior.\n- With *reflecting edges*, the population is conserved within the domain. Since the trivial state is unstable for any $r>0$, any initial population will grow. The logistic term stabilizes this growth, and diffusion averages out any spatial variations, leading to convergence to the stable, spatially uniform carrying capacity $u(x) \\equiv K$.\n- With *absorbing edges*, the persistence condition $L > \\pi\\sqrt{D/r}$ defines a critical length $L_c = \\pi\\sqrt{D/r}$. If $L  L_c$, the trivial solution is linearly stable. For the logistic model, since $f(u) \\le ru$, the comparison principle for PDEs implies that the population will decay to zero if the linearized system decays. Thus, for habitats smaller than the critical length, the population is guaranteed to go extinct.\n\n**Conclusion:** Statements A, C, and E are correct.",
