            "solution": "The problem requires a complete analysis of the dynamical system described by the ordinary differential equation (ODE) $\\dot{x} = \\mu x - \\gamma x^3$, which is the normal form for a pitchfork bifurcation. The analysis will proceed in three steps as requested: finding the equilibria, determining their stability, and classifying the bifurcation.\n\n**1. Determination of Equilibria**\nEquilibrium points, denoted by $x^{\\ast}$, are solutions to the equation $\\dot{x} = 0$. For the given system, we must solve:\n$$\n\\mu x^{\\ast} - \\gamma (x^{\\ast})^3 = 0\n$$\nThis equation can be factored as:\n$$\nx^{\\ast} (\\mu - \\gamma (x^{\\ast})^2) = 0\n$$\nFrom this factored form, we identify two sets of solutions.\n\nThe first solution is the **trivial equilibrium**:\n$$\nx^{\\ast}_{0} = 0\n$$\nThis equilibrium point exists for all values of the parameters $\\mu$ and $\\gamma$.\n\nThe second set of solutions, the **nontrivial equilibria**, are found by setting the second factor to zero:\n$$\n\\mu - \\gamma (x^{\\ast})^2 = 0\n$$\nSolving for $x^{\\ast}$ yields:\n$$\n(x^{\\ast})^2 = \\frac{\\mu}{\\gamma}\n$$\nThis gives two nontrivial solutions, provided the right-hand side is non-negative:\n$$\nx^{\\ast}_{\\pm} = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{\\gamma}}\n$$\nFor these solutions to be real-valued, the condition $\\frac{\\mu}{\\gamma} \\ge 0$ must be met. Since the problem states $\\gamma \\neq 0$, and the bifurcation point is at $\\mu = 0$, the nontrivial equilibria exist as distinct real roots when $\\frac{\\mu}{\\gamma}  0$. This means that $\\mu$ and $\\gamma$ must have the same sign.\n\n**2. Local Stability Analysis**\nThe local stability of an equilibrium $x^{\\ast}$ is determined by the eigenvalue of the Jacobian of the vector field $f(x) = \\mu x - \\gamma x^3$ evaluated at $x^{\\ast}$. For a one-dimensional system, this is simply the derivative $\\lambda = f'(x^{\\ast})$. A negative eigenvalue ($\\lambda  0$) implies local stability, while a positive eigenvalue ($\\lambda  0$) implies instability.\n\nFirst, we compute the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$\nf'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(\\mu x - \\gamma x^3) = \\mu - 3\\gamma x^2\n$$\nNow we evaluate this expression at each equilibrium.\n\n- **Stability of the trivial equilibrium ($x^{\\ast}_{0} = 0$)**:\nThe eigenvalue $\\lambda_0$ at the trivial equilibrium is:\n$$\n\\lambda_0 = f'(0) = \\mu - 3\\gamma (0)^2 = \\mu\n$$\nThe stability of the trivial branch is thus governed by the sign of $\\mu$: it is stable for $\\mu  0$ and unstable for $\\mu  0$. At $\\mu=0$, the eigenvalue is zero, confirming it as the bifurcation point.\n\n- **Stability of the nontrivial equilibria ($x^{\\ast}_{\\pm} = \\pm\\sqrt{\\mu/\\gamma}$)**:\nThese branches exist for $\\mu/\\gamma  0$. We substitute $(x^{\\ast}_{\\pm})^2 = \\frac{\\mu}{\\gamma}$ into the expression for the eigenvalue:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\pm} = f'(x^{\\ast}_{\\pm}) = \\mu - 3\\gamma (x^{\\ast}_{\\pm})^2 = \\mu - 3\\gamma \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\gamma}\\right)\n$$\nSince $\\gamma \\neq 0$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\pm} = \\mu - 3\\mu = -2\\mu\n$$\nThe stability of these nontrivial branches depends on the sign of $\\mu$. Because they exist only when $\\mu$ and $\\gamma$ have the same sign, we can deduce their stability.\nIf $\\mu  0$ (which implies $\\gamma  0$), then $\\lambda_{\\pm} = -2\\mu  0$, making the nontrivial branches stable.\nIf $\\mu  0$ (which implies $\\gamma  0$), then $\\lambda_{\\pm} = -2\\mu  0$, making the nontrivial branches unstable.\n\n**3. Bifurcation Classification**\nThe classification depends on the sign of the nonlinear coefficient $\\gamma$.\n\n- **Supercritical Pitchfork Bifurcation ($\\gamma  0$)**:\nFor $\\mu  0$, the only real equilibrium is $x^{\\ast}_{0} = 0$, which is stable ($\\lambda_0 = \\mu  0$). As $\\mu$ increases through $0$, the trivial equilibrium becomes unstable ($\\lambda_0 = \\mu  0$). Simultaneously, for $\\mu  0$, the two nontrivial equilibria $x^{\\ast}_{\\pm} = \\pm\\sqrt{\\mu/\\gamma}$ emerge. As established above, when $\\mu  0$ and $\\gamma  0$, these new branches are stable ($\\lambda_{\\pm} = -2\\mu  0$). This scenario, where a stable equilibrium loses stability and gives rise to two new stable equilibria, defines a **supercritical** pitchfork bifurcation. The condition for this is $\\gamma  0$.\n\n- **Subcritical Pitchfork Bifurcation ($\\gamma  0$)**:\nFor this case, we consider $\\mu$ increasing from negative values. For $\\mu  0$ (which implies $\\gamma  0$ for existence of nontrivial roots), there are three equilibria: the stable trivial equilibrium $x^{\\ast}_{0} = 0$ ($\\lambda_0 = \\mu  0$) and the two unstable nontrivial equilibria $x^{\\ast}_{\\pm} = \\pm\\sqrt{\\mu/\\gamma}$ ($\\lambda_{\\pm} = -2\\mu  0$). As $\\mu$ approaches $0$ from below, the two unstable branches move toward the origin and merge with the stable trivial branch. For $\\mu  0$, the nontrivial solutions are no longer real, and the trivial solution becomes unstable ($\\lambda_0 = \\mu  0$). This scenario, where two unstable branches merge with a stable branch, leading to a single unstable branch, defines a **subcritical** pitchfork bifurcation. The condition for this is $\\gamma  0$.\n\n**4. Final Answer Derivation**\nThe question asks for the simplified expression for the linearization eigenvalue along the nontrivial equilibrium branches, $x^{\\ast}_{\\pm}(\\mu,\\gamma)$, expressed in terms of $\\mu$ and $\\gamma$. As derived in the stability analysis (Part 2), this eigenvalue is:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\pm} = -2\\mu\n$$\nThis is the final analytical expression required.",

            "introduction": "The consequences of nonlinearity are not confined to continuous-time systems; they are equally profound in discrete-time maps, which are fundamental to computational models, population dynamics, and neural networks. This exercise shifts our focus to a discrete-time adaptive response model governed by a sigmoid function—a ubiquitous source of nonlinearity. You will explore how the \"steepness\" of this nonlinear response can act as a bifurcation parameter, driving the system from a single stable state to more complex dynamic regimes, a phenomenon crucial for understanding memory, switching, and adaptation in various complex systems .",

            "problem": "Consider a discrete-time scalar adaptive response model in which an agent’s normalized activation $x_t \\in (0,1)$ evolves according to the nonlinear map $x_{t+1} = \\sigma(x_t - \\tau)$, where $\\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-k z)}$ is a sigmoid with steepness parameter $k  0$ and threshold parameter $\\tau \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Using only the definitions of fixed points, monotonicity, and the linearization principle for one-dimensional discrete-time dynamical systems, derive the fixed-point condition $x^{\\ast} = \\sigma(x^{\\ast} - \\tau)$ and the local stability criterion in terms of $k$ and $x^{\\ast}$. Based on your derivation, explain how the steepness parameter $k$ controls threshold sharpness and the transition between dynamical regimes (convergence to a fixed point versus loss of local stability). Finally, specialize to the case $\\tau = \\frac{1}{2}$ and determine the exact critical steepness $k_{\\mathrm{c}}$ at which the fixed point loses local stability. Provide your final numerical answer for $k_{\\mathrm{c}}$ with no rounding and no units.",
            "solution": "The evolution of the agent's activation is governed by the nonlinear map $x_{t+1} = f(x_t)$, where the function $f: (0,1) \\to (0,1)$ is defined as\n$$\nf(x) = \\sigma(x - \\tau) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-k(x - \\tau))}\n$$\nwith parameters $k  0$ and $\\tau \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nFirst, we derive the fixed-point condition. A fixed point, denoted $x^{\\ast}$, is a value of the state variable that remains unchanged under the action of the map. By definition, a fixed point must satisfy the equation $x_{t+1} = x_t = x^{\\ast}$. Substituting this into the evolution equation gives:\n$$\nx^{\\ast} = f(x^{\\ast})\n$$\nwhich, using the specific form of $f(x)$, yields the required fixed-point condition:\n$$\nx^{\\ast} = \\sigma(x^{\\ast} - \\tau)\n$$\n\nNext, we derive the local stability criterion for a fixed point $x^{\\ast}$. According to the linearization principle for one-dimensional discrete-time systems, a fixed point $x^{\\ast}$ is locally stable if small perturbations around it decay over time. This is guaranteed if the magnitude of the derivative of the map, evaluated at the fixed point, is less than one:\n$$\n|f'(x^{\\ast})|  1\n$$\nTo apply this criterion, we must first compute the derivative of $f(x)$. Using the chain rule, we have:\n$$\nf'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( (1 + \\exp(-k(x - \\tau)))^{-1} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nf'(x) = -1 \\cdot (1 + \\exp(-k(x - \\tau)))^{-2} \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx}(\\exp(-k(x - \\tau)))\n$$\n$$\nf'(x) = -(1 + \\exp(-k(x - \\tau)))^{-2} \\cdot \\exp(-k(x - \\tau)) \\cdot (-k)\n$$\n$$\nf'(x) = k \\frac{\\exp(-k(x - \\tau))}{(1 + \\exp(-k(x - \\tau)))^2}\n$$\nThis expression can be rewritten more elegantly in terms of the function $\\sigma(z)$ itself, where $z = x-\\tau$:\n$$\nf'(x) = k \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-k(x-\\tau))}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\exp(-k(x-\\tau))}{1 + \\exp(-k(x-\\tau))}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nf'(x) = k \\sigma(x-\\tau) \\left(\\frac{1 + \\exp(-k(x-\\tau)) - 1}{1 + \\exp(-k(x-\\tau))}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nf'(x) = k \\sigma(x-\\tau) \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-k(x-\\tau))}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nf'(x) = k \\sigma(x-\\tau) (1 - \\sigma(x-\\tau))\n$$\nNow, we evaluate this derivative at the fixed point $x^{\\ast}$. At this point, we know that $x^{\\ast} = \\sigma(x^{\\ast} - \\tau)$. Substituting this into the expression for the derivative gives:\n$$\nf'(x^{\\ast}) = k x^{\\ast} (1 - x^{\\ast})\n$$\nThe local stability criterion $|f'(x^{\\ast})|  1$ thus becomes:\n$$\n|k x^{\\ast} (1 - x^{\\ast})|  1\n$$\nSince $k  0$ and the range of the sigmoid function is $(0,1)$, any fixed point $x^{\\ast}$ must lie in the interval $(0,1)$. Consequently, the product $x^{\\ast}(1-x^{\\ast})$ is strictly positive. The stability criterion simplifies to:\n$$\nk x^{\\ast} (1 - x^{\\ast})  1\n$$\n\nThe steepness parameter $k$ plays a dual role. First, it controls the \"threshold sharpness\" of the sigmoid function. The slope of $\\sigma(z)$ is $\\sigma'(z) = k \\sigma(z)(1-\\sigma(z))$. This slope is maximal at $z=0$ (i.e., at $x=\\tau$), where its value is $k \\sigma(0)(1-\\sigma(0)) = k(\\frac{1}{2})(\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{k}{4}$. For large $k$, the slope is very high, and the sigmoid function approximates a Heaviside step function, causing a sharp, switch-like transition in activation. For small $k$, the transition is gradual.\nSecond, $k$ controls the transition between dynamical regimes. For small $k$, the condition $k x^{\\ast}(1-x^{\\ast})  1$ is satisfied, ensuring $0  f'(x^{\\ast})  1$. The system converges monotonically to a single, stable fixed point. As $k$ increases, the derivative $f'(x^{\\ast})$ increases. The loss of local stability occurs when $f'(x^{\\ast})=1$. At this critical point, a bifurcation occurs, fundamentally changing the system's long-term behavior. Since $f'(x)$ is always positive, the fixed point loses stability via a tangent bifurcation (e.g., saddle-node) or a pitchfork bifurcation, not a period-doubling bifurcation (which requires $f'(x^{\\ast})=-1$). This bifurcation can lead to the emergence of multiple fixed points (bistability) or more complex dynamics, marking a transition from a simple, predictable regime to a complex one.\n\nFinally, we specialize to the case where the threshold is $\\tau = \\frac{1}{2}$. The map is $x_{t+1} = \\sigma(x_t - \\frac{1}{2})$. We find the fixed point by inspection. Let's test $x^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}$:\n$$\n\\sigma\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\sigma(0) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(0)} = \\frac{1}{1+1} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nSo, $x^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}$ is a fixed point for all $k  0$ when $\\tau = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nTo find the critical steepness $k_{\\mathrm{c}}$ at which this fixed point loses stability, we apply the stability criterion. The loss of stability occurs when the inequality becomes an equality, i.e., at the bifurcation point where $|f'(x^{\\ast})| = 1$.\n$$\nf'(x^{\\ast}) = k x^{\\ast} (1 - x^{\\ast}) = 1\n$$\nSubstituting the fixed point $x^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}$ and the critical steepness $k = k_{\\mathrm{c}}$:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{c}} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 1\n$$\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{c}} \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = 1\n$$\nSolving for $k_{\\mathrm{c}}$ yields the exact critical value:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{c}} = 4\n$$\nFor $k  4$, the fixed point $x^{\\ast}=\\frac{1}{2}$ is stable. For $k  4$, it becomes unstable, and the system transitions (via a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation) to a regime with two new stable fixed points.",

Let $y_t = x_t - x^\\ast(\\mu)$ be the fluctuation around the equilibrium. The dynamics of $y_t$ are found by substituting $x_t = x^\\ast(\\mu) + y_t$ into the SDE. We perform a Taylor expansion of the drift term $f(x_t; \\mu)$ around $x^\\ast(\\mu)$:\n$$\nf(x_t; \\mu) = f(x^\\ast(\\mu); \\mu) + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x=x^\\ast(\\mu)} (x_t - x^\\ast(\\mu)) + \\mathcal{O}((x_t - x^\\ast(\\mu))^2)\n$$\nBy definition, the equilibrium point satisfies $f(x^\\ast(\\mu); \\mu) = 0$. The partial derivative is defined as the linear stability exponent, $\\lambda(\\mu) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\big|_{x=x^\\ast(\\mu)}$. For small fluctuations $y_t$, we can neglect the higher-order terms. The dynamics for $x_t$ are then approximated by:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}x_t \\approx \\lambda(\\mu) y_t \\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t\n$$\nSince $x^\\ast(\\mu)$ is treated as a constant for a fixed $\\mu$, we have $\\mathrm{d}y_t = \\mathrm{d}(x_t - x^\\ast(\\mu)) = \\mathrm{d}x_t$. The linearized SDE for the fluctuation $y_t$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}y_t = \\lambda(\\mu) y_t \\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t\n$$\nThis is the equation for an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. We are given that for $\\mu  \\mu_c$, the equilibrium is stable, so $\\lambda(\\mu)  0$.\n\n**1. Deterministic Recovery Time**\nTo find the characteristic recovery time from a small perturbation, we consider the deterministic part of the dynamics by setting $\\sigma=0$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y_t}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\lambda(\\mu) y_t\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. Given an initial perturbation $y(0) = y_0$, the solution is:\n$$\ny(t) = y_0 e^{\\lambda(\\mu) t}\n$$\nThe characteristic recovery time, $\\tau$, is the time it takes for the perturbation to decay to $1/e$ of its initial value.\n$$\ny(\\tau) = y_0 e^{-1} = y_0 e^{\\lambda(\\mu) \\tau}\n$$\nThis implies $\\lambda(\\mu) \\tau = -1$. Since $\\lambda(\\mu)  0$, we can write $\\lambda(\\mu) = -|\\lambda(\\mu)|$.

Stationary Variance**\nThe OU process is stationary for $\\lambda(\\mu)  0$. The formal solution for $y_t$ can be written as:\n$$\ny_t = e^{\\lambda(\\mu) t} y_0 + \\sigma \\int_0^t e^{\\lambda(\\mu)(t-s)} \\mathrm{d}W_s\n$$\nFor a stationary process, the mean $\\langle y_t \\rangle$ is constant. Taking the expectation, $\\langle y_t \\rangle = e^{\\lambda(\\mu) t} \\langle y_0 \\rangle$. Since $\\lambda(\\mu)  0$, for the process to be stationary (independent of initial conditions in the limit $t \\to \\infty$), the mean must be zero. $\\langle y_t \\rangle_{st} = 0$.\nThe stationary variance is $\\text{Var}(y_t) = \\langle y_t^2 \\rangle_{st}$. To compute this, we consider the process starting from $t_0 \\to -\\infty$:\n$$\ny_t = \\sigma \\int_{-\\infty}^t e^{\\lambda(\\mu)(t-s)} \\mathrm{d}W_s\n$$\nThe variance is $\\text{Var}(y_t) = \\langle y_t^2 \\rangle = \\sigma^2 \\left\\langle \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^t e^{\\lambda(\\mu)(t-s)} \\mathrm{d}W_s \\right)^2 \\right\\rangle$.

Therefore, the stationary variance is:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(y_t) = \\frac{-\\sigma^2}{2\\lambda(\\mu)}\n$$\nAs $\\mu \\to \\mu_c^{-}$, $\\lambda(\\mu) \\to 0^{-}$. The denominator approaches zero, so the variance diverges. The scaling is proportional to $1/(-\\lambda(\\mu))$.\n\n**3. Lag-$\\Delta$ Autocorrelation**\nThe autocorrelation function for a stationary process is $C(\\Delta) = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(y_t, y_{t+\\Delta})}{\\text{Var}(y_t)}$. Since the stationary mean is $0$, $\\text{Cov}(y_t, y_{t+\\Delta}) = \\langle y_t y_{t+\\Delta} \\rangle$.\nWe express $y_{t+\\Delta}$ in terms of $y_t$:\n$$\ny_{t+\\Delta} = y_t e^{\\lambda(\\mu)\\Delta} + \\sigma \\int_t^{t+\\Delta} e^{\\lambda(\\mu)(t+\\Delta-s)} \\mathrm{d}W_s\n$$\nThen we compute the expectation of the product:\n$$\n\\langle y_t y_{t+\\Delta} \\rangle = \\left\\langle y_t \\left( y_t e^{\\lambda(\\mu)\\Delta} + \\sigma \\int_t^{t+\\Delta} e^{\\lambda(\\mu)(t+\\Delta-s)} \\mathrm{d}W_s \\right) \\right\\rangle\n$$\n$$\n\\langle y_t y_{t+\\Delta} \\rangle = e^{\\lambda(\\mu)\\Delta} \\langle y_t^2 \\rangle + \\sigma \\left\\langle y_t \\int_t^{t+\\Delta} e^{\\lambda(\\mu)(t+\\Delta-s)} \\mathrm{d}W_s \\right\\rangle\n$$\nThe second term is zero because $y_t$ is determined by the history of the Wiener process up to time $t$, whereas the integral involves increments of $W_s$ for $s  t$, which are independent of the past. Thus, the expectation of the product is the product of the expectations, and $\\langle y_t \\rangle = 0$.\nSo, $\\langle y_t y_{t+\\Delta} \\rangle = e^{\\lambda(\\mu)\\Delta} \\langle y_t^2 \\rangle = e^{\\lambda(\\mu)\\Delta} \\text{Var}(y_t)$.\nThe autocorrelation function is:\n$$\nC(\\Delta) = \\frac{e^{\\lambda(\\mu)\\Delta} \\text{Var}(y_t)}{\\text{Var}(y_t)} = e^{\\lambda(\\mu)\\Delta}\n$$\nNow we examine its behavior as $\\mu \\to \\mu_c^{-}$. For any fixed lag $\\Delta  0$:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\mu \\to \\mu_c^{-}} C(\\Delta) = \\lim_{\\lambda(\\mu) \\to 0^{-}} e^{\\lambda(\\mu)\\Delta} = e^{0} = 1\n$$\nSince $\\lambda(\\mu)$ is negative and increases toward $0$, the exponent $\\lambda(\\mu)\\Delta$ is negative and increases toward $0$. The exponential function $e^x$ is monotonically increasing, so the autocorrelation increases toward $1$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The characteristic recovery time back to equilibrium after a small perturbation diverges like $1/|\\lambda(\\mu)|$.**\nOur derivation shows the recovery time is $\\tau = 1/|\\lambda(\\mu)|$. As $\\mu \\to \\mu_c^{-}$, $|\\lambda(\\mu)| \\to 0^{+}$, causing $\\tau$ to diverge. The scaling is explicitly $1/|\\lambda(\\mu)|$. This statement is a direct consequence of our derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. For any fixed lag $\\Delta0$, the autocorrelation at lag $\\Delta$ of the stationary fluctuations increases toward $1$.**\nOur derivation shows the autocorrelation is $C(\\Delta) = e^{\\lambda(\\mu)\\Delta}$. Given $\\lambda(\\mu)  0$ and $\\Delta  0$, the value of $C(\\Delta)$ is less than $1$. As $\\mu \\to \\mu_c^{-}$, $\\lambda(\\mu) \\to 0^{-}$, so the exponent $\\lambda(\\mu)\\Delta \\to 0$. Consequently, $C(\\Delta) \\to e^0 = 1$. The value of $C(\\Delta)$ increases from a value less than $1$ towards $1$. This confirms the statement. This phenomenon reflects the system's increasing \"memory\" as it approaches the bifurcation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. For fixed $\\sigma$, the stationary variance of the fluctuations diverges and scales proportionally to $\\sigma^2/(-\\lambda(\\mu))$.**\nOur derivation yielded the stationary variance as $\\text{Var}(y_t) = \\frac{-\\sigma^2}{2\\lambda(\\mu)} = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2(-\\lambda(\\mu))}$. For fixed $\\sigma0$, as $\\mu \\to \\mu_c^{-}$, $\\lambda(\\mu) \\to 0^{-}$, so the denominator $2(-\\lambda(\\mu)) \\to 0^{+}$, and the variance diverges to $+\\infty$. The variance is directly proportional to $\\frac{\\sigma^2}{-\\lambda(\\mu)}$ with a constant of proportionality of $1/2$. The statement is accurate.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. For fixed $\\sigma$, the lag-$\\Delta$ autocorrelation decreases toward $0$ because the system becomes less stable near the bifurcation.**\nThis statement is the opposite of what was derived in point B. The autocorrelation increases toward $1$. The reasoning is also flawed: less stability means slower relaxation to equilibrium, which implies that the system state at a later time is *more* correlated with its current state, not less. The system's memory becomes longer, not shorter.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. If $\\sigma$ is held constant, the stationary variance remains bounded while only the mean shifts; divergence of the variance requires $\\sigma \\to \\infty$.**\nThis statement is contradicted by our derivation on multiple points. First, as shown in point C, for any fixed $\\sigma  0$, the variance $\\text{Var}(y_t) = \\frac{-\\sigma^2}{2\\lambda(\\mu)}$ diverges as $\\lambda(\\mu) \\to 0^{-}$. It does not remain bounded. Second, the divergence is caused by the system's internal dynamics (slowing down), not by the noise amplitude $\\sigma$ going to infinity. The statement is fundamentally incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
