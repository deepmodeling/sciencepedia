            "solution": "The problem statement is a well-posed and mathematically sound exercise in elementary real analysis, specifically the derivation of the error bound for a first-order Taylor expansion and its application. All provided information is self-contained, consistent, and scientifically grounded. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe objective is to derive a bound on the local linearization error $R_1(x) = f(x) - L(x)$ and then find the largest radius $\\delta^\\star$ around $x_0$ for which the linearization is accurate to within a tolerance $\\varepsilon  0$. The derivation must proceed from the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC) and the Mean Value Theorem (MVT).\n\nLet the linearization error be defined as $R_1(x) = f(x) - L(x)$, where $L(x) = f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x-x_0)$.\n$$R_1(x) = f(x) - f(x_0) - f'(x_0)(x-x_0)$$\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we can express the difference $f(x) - f(x_0)$ as an integral of its derivative:\n$$f(x) - f(x_0) = \\int_{x_0}^{x} f'(t) dt$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $R_1(x)$ yields:\n$$R_1(x) = \\int_{x_0}^{x} f'(t) dt - f'(x_0)(x-x_0)$$\nThe second term can also be written as an integral: $f'(x_0)(x-x_0) = f'(x_0) \\int_{x_0}^{x} 1 \\, dt = \\int_{x_0}^{x} f'(x_0) dt$.\nCombining the two terms, we obtain the error term in integral form:\n$$R_1(x) = \\int_{x_0}^{x} (f'(t) - f'(x_0)) dt$$\nNow, we analyze the integrand, $g(t) = f'(t) - f'(x_0)$. Since $f$ is twice continuously differentiable on the interval $I$, the function $f'$ is continuously differentiable on $I$. We can apply the Mean Value Theorem to $f'$ on the interval with endpoints $x_0$ and $t$. For any $t \\in I$, there exists a number $\\xi$ strictly between $x_0$ and $t$ such that:\n$$\\frac{f'(t) - f'(x_0)}{t-x_0} = f''(\\xi)$$\nThis gives an expression for the integrand: $f'(t) - f'(x_0) = f''(\\xi)(t-x_0)$.\n\nWe can now bound the error $R_1(x)$. Taking the absolute value of the integral expression for $R_1(x)$:\n$$|R_1(x)| = \\left| \\int_{x_0}^{x} (f'(t) - f'(x_0)) dt \\right|$$\nUsing the MVT result:\n$$|R_1(x)| = \\left| \\int_{x_0}^{x} f''(\\xi_t)(t-x_0) dt \\right|$$\nwhere for each $t$, $\\xi_t$ is some value between $x_0$ and $t$.\nUsing the triangle inequality for integrals, which states that $|\\int_a^b g(u) du| \\leq |\\int_a^b |g(u)| du|$, we get:\n$$|R_1(x)| \\leq \\left| \\int_{x_0}^{x} |f''(\\xi_t)(t-x_0)| dt \\right| = \\left| \\int_{x_0}^{x} |f''(\\xi_t)| |t-x_0| dt \\right|$$\nThe problem states that for all $\\zeta \\in I$, $|f''(\\zeta)| \\leq M$. Since $x \\in I$ and $t$ is between $x_0$ and $x$, the value $\\xi_t$ (which lies between $x_0$ and $t$) must also be in $I$. Thus, $|f''(\\xi_t)| \\leq M$.\n$$|R_1(x)| \\leq \\left| \\int_{x_0}^{x} M |t-x_0| dt \\right|$$\nWe evaluate this integral.\nCase 1: $x \\ge x_0$. In this case, the integration interval is $[x_0, x]$, and for $t \\in [x_0, x]$, $|t-x_0| = t-x_0$.\n$$|R_1(x)| \\leq \\int_{x_0}^{x} M (t-x_0) dt = M \\left[ \\frac{(t-x_0)^2}{2} \\right]_{x_0}^{x} = M \\frac{(x-x_0)^2}{2}$$\nCase 2: $x  x_0$. The integration interval is $[x, x_0]$, and for $t \\in [x, x_0]$, $|t-x_0| = -(t-x_0) = x_0-t$. The integral is:\n$$|R_1(x)| \\leq \\left| \\int_{x_0}^{x} M (x_0-t) dt \\right| = \\left| - \\int_{x}^{x_0} M(x_0-t) dt \\right| = \\int_{x}^{x_0} M(x_0-t) dt$$\n$$|R_1(x)| \\leq M \\left[ -\\frac{(x_0-t)^2}{2} \\right]_{x}^{x_0} = M \\left( 0 - \\left( -\\frac{(x_0-x)^2}{2} \\right) \\right) = M \\frac{(x-x_0)^2}{2}$$\nIn both cases, we obtain the same bound on the linearization error:\n$$|f(x) - L(x)| \\leq \\frac{M}{2}(x-x_0)^2$$\n\nNext, we seek the largest radius $\\delta^\\star$ such that for all $x$ with $|x-x_0| \\leq \\delta^\\star$, the accuracy condition $|f(x) - L(x)| \\leq \\varepsilon$ is satisfied.\nUsing our derived bound, a sufficient condition for the accuracy requirement to hold is:\n$$\\frac{M}{2}(x-x_0)^2 \\leq \\varepsilon$$\nWe must consider two scenarios for the constant $M \\geq 0$.\nIf $M=0$, then $f''(\\xi)=0$ for all $\\xi \\in I$, which implies that $f$ is a linear function on the interval $I$. In this case, the linearization $L(x)$ is identical to $f(x)$, so the error is $R_1(x) = 0$. The condition $0 \\leq \\varepsilon$ is always true since $\\varepsilon0$. The linearization is perfectly accurate for all $x \\in I$. The largest radius of accuracy is thus $\\delta^\\star = \\rho$, the radius of the interval $I$.\nIf $M0$, we can rearrange the inequality:\n$$(x-x_0)^2 \\leq \\frac{2\\varepsilon}{M}$$\n$$|x-x_0| \\leq \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\varepsilon}{M}}$$\nThis inequality defines a range of $x$ values around $x_0$ for which the linearization is guaranteed to be accurate. We want to find the largest radius $\\delta$ such that the accuracy condition $|f(x)-L(x)| \\le \\varepsilon$ holds for all $x$ satisfying $|x-x_0| \\le \\delta$.\nFrom our error bound, the error $|f(x)-L(x)|$ is at most $\\frac{M}{2}(x-x_0)^2$. For all $x$ in the interval $[x_0-\\delta, x_0+\\delta]$, the maximum value of this bound occurs at the endpoints, where $|x-x_0|=\\delta$. This maximum value is $\\frac{M}{2}\\delta^2$. To guarantee accuracy for all $x$ in this range, we require this maximum possible error to be no more than $\\varepsilon$:\n$$\\frac{M}{2}\\delta^2 \\leq \\varepsilon \\implies \\delta \\leq \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\varepsilon}{M}}$$\nThe largest such $\\delta$ is therefore $\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\varepsilon}{M}}$.\n\nHowever, our entire derivation relies on the assumption that $x \\in I = [x_0-\\rho, x_0+\\rho]$, which means $|x-x_0| \\leq \\rho$. For the accuracy condition to be established over a radius $\\delta$, we must have $\\delta \\leq \\rho$. Thus, the most complete answer is $\\delta^\\star = \\min\\left(\\rho, \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\varepsilon}{M}}\\right)$.\n\nThe problem, however, explicitly asks for an expression for $\\delta^\\star$ solely in terms of $\\varepsilon$ and $M$. This is a directive to provide the radius of accuracy as determined by the intrinsic properties of the function (its nonlinearity, captured by $M$) and the desired tolerance ($\\varepsilon$), under the implicit assumption that the domain of validity (defined by $\\rho$) is large enough not to be the limiting factor. This is a standard perspective in local analysis. We therefore report the radius of accuracy that arises from the error bound itself.\n\n$$ \\delta^\\star = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\varepsilon}{M}} $$\nThis expression captures the core consequence of nonlinearity: the radius of accurate linearization shrinks with increasing curvature $M$ and grows with increasing error tolerance $\\varepsilon$.",

This means that $\\mu$ and $\\gamma$ must have the same sign.\n\n**2. Local Stability Analysis**\nThe local stability of an equilibrium $x^{\\ast}$ is determined by the eigenvalue of the Jacobian of the vector field $f(x) = \\mu x - \\gamma x^3$ evaluated at $x^{\\ast}$. For a one-dimensional system, this is simply the derivative $\\lambda = f'(x^{\\ast})$.

At $\\mu=0$, the eigenvalue is zero, confirming it as the bifurcation point.\n\n- **Stability of the nontrivial equilibria ($x^{\\ast}_{\\pm} = \\pm\\sqrt{\\mu/\\gamma}$)**:\nThese branches exist for $\\mu/\\gamma  0$.

Bifurcation Classification**\nThe classification depends on the sign of the nonlinear coefficient $\\gamma$.\n\n- **Supercritical Pitchfork Bifurcation ($\\gamma  0$)**:\nFor $\\mu  0$, the only real equilibrium is $x^{\\ast}_{0} = 0$, which is stable ($\\lambda_0 = \\mu  0$). As $\\mu$ increases through $0$, the trivial equilibrium becomes unstable ($\\lambda_0 = \\mu  0$). Simultaneously, for $\\mu  0$, the two nontrivial equilibria $x^{\\ast}_{\\pm} = \\pm\\sqrt{\\mu/\\gamma}$ emerge. As established above, when $\\mu  0$ and $\\gamma  0$, these new branches are stable ($\\lambda_{\\pm} = -2\\mu  0$). This scenario, where a stable equilibrium loses stability and gives rise to two new stable equilibria, defines a **supercritical** pitchfork bifurcation. The condition for this is $\\gamma  0$.\n\n- **Subcritical Pitchfork Bifurcation ($\\gamma  0$)**:\nFor this case, we consider $\\mu$ increasing from negative values. For $\\mu  0$ (which implies $\\gamma  0$ for existence of nontrivial roots), there are three equilibria: the stable trivial equilibrium $x^{\\ast}_{0} = 0$ ($\\lambda_0 = \\mu  0$) and the two unstable nontrivial equilibria $x^{\\ast}_{\\pm} = \\pm\\sqrt{\\mu/\\gamma}$ ($\\lambda_{\\pm} = -2\\mu  0$). As $\\mu$ approaches $0$ from below, the two unstable branches move toward the origin and merge with the stable trivial branch. For $\\mu  0$, the nontrivial solutions are no longer real, and the trivial solution becomes unstable ($\\lambda_0 = \\mu  0$). This scenario, where two unstable branches merge with a stable branch, leading to a single unstable branch, defines a **subcritical** pitchfork bifurcation. The condition for this is $\\gamma  0$.\n\n**4.
