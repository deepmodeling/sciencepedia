This analysis will be performed by deriving the conditions for Schur stability on the parameters $(a,b)$ using the Jury test, interpreting these conditions geometrically, and calculating the area of the resulting stability region.\n\nFirst, we represent the second-order recurrence relation as a first-order vector-matrix equation. Let the state vector be $\\mathbf{x}_t = (y_t, y_{t-1})^{\\top}$. The dynamics are then given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}_{t+1} = \\begin{pmatrix} y_{t+1} \\\\ y_t \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a  b \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} y_t \\\\ y_{t-1} \\end{pmatrix} = A \\mathbf{x}_t\n$$\nwhere $A = \\begin{pmatrix} a  b \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$ is the system matrix, also known as the companion matrix of the characteristic polynomial.\n\nThe fixed point $\\mathbf{x}^{\\ast} = \\mathbf{0}$ is asymptotically stable if and only if all eigenvalues of the matrix $A$ have a magnitude strictly less than $1$. This is the definition of Schur stability for the matrix $A$.

For Schur stability, the roots of $P(\\lambda)$ must lie strictly inside the unit disk in the complex plane.\n\n**1. Derivation of Stability Conditions using the Jury Test**\n\nThe Jury test provides necessary and sufficient conditions for a polynomial's roots to lie within the unit disk. For a second-degree polynomial of the form $P(\\lambda) = c_2\\lambda^2 + c_1\\lambda + c_0$ with real coefficients and $c_2  0$, the conditions are:\n1. $P(1)  0$\n2. $(-1)^2 P(-1)  0$, which simplifies to $P(-1)  0$\n3. $|c_0|  c_2$\n\nFor our characteristic polynomial $P(\\lambda) = \\lambda^2 - a\\lambda - b$, the coefficients are $c_2=1$, $c_1=-a$, and $c_0=-b$. Since $c_2=10$, we can apply the Jury test directly.\n\nCondition 1: $P(1)  0$\n$$\nP(1) = 1^2 - a(1) - b = 1 - a - b  0 \\implies a+b  1 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad b  1-a\n$$\n\nCondition 2: $P(-1)  0$\n$$\nP(-1) = (-1)^2 - a(-1) - b = 1 + a - b  0 \\implies a-b  -1 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad b  1+a\n$$\n\nCondition 3: $|c_0|  c_2$\n$$\n|-b|  1 \\implies |b|  1 \\implies -1  b  1\n$$\n\nThus, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the asymptotic stability of the fixed point $\\mathbf{x}^{\\ast} = \\mathbf{0}$ are the following three inequalities on the parameters $(a,b)$:\n1. $a+b  1$\n2. $a-b  -1$ (or $b-a  1$)\n3. $|b|  1$\n\n**2. Geometric Interpretation of the Stability Region**\n\nThe set of inequalities defines a region $\\mathcal{S}$ in the $(a,b)$-plane, known as the stability region. We interpret each inequality as an open half-plane:\n- $b  1-a$: The region below the line $b = 1-a$.\n- $b  1+a$: The region below the line $b = 1+a$.\n- $b  -1$: The region above the line $b = -1$.\n- $b  1$: The region below the line $b = 1$.\n\nThe stability region $\\mathcal{S}$ is the intersection of these half-planes. We can show that the condition $b1$ is redundant. The upper boundary of the region is determined by $b  \\min(1-a, 1+a)$.\n- For $a \\ge 0$, $1-a \\le 1+a$, so the boundary is $b  1-a$. Since $a \\ge 0$, $1-a \\le 1$, so $b1-a$ implies $b1$.\n- For $a  0$, $1+a  1-a$, so the boundary is $b  1+a$. Since $a0$, $1+a1$, so $b1+a$ implies $b1$.\nTherefore, the inequality $b1$ is implied by the other two upper-bound inequalities, $b  1-a$ and $b  1+a$.\n\nThe stability region $\\mathcal{S}$ is thus defined by the simplified set of three inequalities:\n1. $b  1-a$\n2. $b  1+a$\n3. $b  -1$\n\nThis region is an open triangle in the $(a,b)$-plane.\n- **Convexity**: As $\\mathcal{S}$ is the intersection of three convex sets (open half-planes), it is itself a convex set.\n- **Boundary and Vertices**: The boundaries of the region are the lines $b = 1-a$, $b = 1+a$, and $b = -1$. The vertices of the closure of $\\mathcal{S}$ are the intersection points of these lines:\n    - Intersection of $b=1-a$ and $b=1+a$:\n      $1-a = 1+a \\implies 2a=0 \\implies a=0$. Then $b=1$. Vertex is $(0,1)$.\n    - Intersection of $b=1-a$ and $b=-1$:\n      $-1 = 1-a \\implies a=2$. Vertex is $(2,-1)$.\n    - Intersection of $b=1+a$ and $b=-1$:\n      $-1 = 1+a \\implies a=-2$. Vertex is $(-2,-1)$.\nThe stability region $\\mathcal{S}$ is the interior of the triangle with vertices at $(-2, -1)$, $(2, -1)$, and $(0, 1)$.\n\n**3. Area of the Stability Region**\n\nWe compute the Lebesgue area of the triangular region $\\mathcal{S}$ in the $(a,b)$-plane. We can take the base of the triangle to be the segment connecting the vertices $(-2,-1)$ and $(2,-1)$. This segment lies on the line $b=-1$.\n- The length of the base is the difference between the $a$-coordinates:\n  $$ \\text{base} = 2 - (-2) = 4 $$\n- The height of the triangle is the perpendicular distance from the third vertex $(0,1)$ to the line containing the base, $b=-1$. This is the difference in the $b$-coordinates:\n  $$ \\text{height} = 1 - (-1) = 2 $$\n- The area of a triangle is given by the formula $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$.\n  $$ \\text{Area}(\\mathcal{S}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 \\times 2 = 4 $$\nThe exact Lebesgue area of the stability region $\\mathcal{S}$ is $4$.",

The problem is self-contained, scientifically sound, and objective. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**.\n\n### Derivation of the Stability Condition\n\nThe dynamics of the networked system are given by\n$$\nx_{i,t+1} = f(x_{i,t}) - \\varepsilon \\sum_{j=1}^N L_{ij} f(x_{j,t})\n$$\nfor each unit $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$, where $f(x) = rx(1-x)$ is the logistic map, $\\varepsilon \\ge 0$ is the coupling strength, and $L$ is the graph Laplacian of the underlying network. This system can be written in a compact vector form. Let $\\mathbf{x}_t = (x_{1,t}, x_{2,t}, \\dots, x_{N,t})^T$ be the state vector of the system at time $t$. Let $F(\\mathbf{x}_t)$ be the vector function where the $i$-th component is $f(x_{i,t})$. The system dynamics can then be expressed as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}_{t+1} = F(\\mathbf{x}_t) - \\varepsilon L F(\\mathbf{x}_t) = (I - \\varepsilon L) F(\\mathbf{x}_t)\n$$\nwhere $I$ is the $N \\times N$ identity matrix. Let us denote the map for the entire system by $G(\\mathbf{x}) = (I - \\varepsilon L) F(\\mathbf{x})$.\n\nA synchronized equilibrium is a state $\\mathbf{x}^\\star = (x^\\star, x^\\star, \\dots, x^\\star)^T$ that is a fixed point of the system, i.e., $G(\\mathbf{x}^\\star) = \\mathbf{x}^\\star$. For this state to be an equilibrium, $x^\\star$ must be a fixed point of the isolated logistic map, $f(x^\\star) = x^\\star$. The problem specifies the non-trivial fixed point for $r1$, which is $x^\\star = 1-1/r$. Let's verify that $\\mathbf{x}^\\star$ is a fixed point of the full system.\n$$\nG(\\mathbf{x}^\\star) = (I - \\varepsilon L) F(\\mathbf{x}^\\star)\n$$\nThe vector $F(\\mathbf{x}^\\star)$ is $(f(x^\\star), \\dots, f(x^\\star))^T = (x^\\star, \\dots, x^\\star)^T = \\mathbf{x}^\\star$.\n$$\nG(\\mathbf{x}^\\star) = (I - \\varepsilon L) \\mathbf{x}^\\star = \\mathbf{x}^\\star - \\varepsilon L \\mathbf{x}^\\star\n$$\nThe graph Laplacian $L$ of any undirected graph has the property that the sum of each row is zero, which implies that the vector of all ones, $\\mathbf{1} = (1, \\dots, 1)^T$, is an eigenvector of $L$ with eigenvalue $0$, i.e., $L\\mathbf{1} = \\mathbf{0}$. Since $\\mathbf{x}^\\star = x^\\star \\mathbf{1}$, we have $L\\mathbf{x}^\\star = x^\\star L\\mathbf{1} = \\mathbf{0}$. Therefore, $G(\\mathbf{x}^\\star) = \\mathbf{x}^\\star$, confirming that the synchronized state is indeed a fixed point of the networked system for any $\\varepsilon$.\n\nTo analyze the linear stability of this fixed point, we compute the Jacobian matrix $J$ of the map $G(\\mathbf{x})$ evaluated at $\\mathbf{x}^\\star$. The entries of the Jacobian are $J_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial G_i}{\\partial x_j}|_{\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{x}^\\star}$.\nThe $i$-th component of $G(\\mathbf{x})$ is $G_i(\\mathbf{x}) = f(x_i) - \\varepsilon \\sum_{k=1}^N L_{ik} f(x_k)$.

The stability condition is $|\\mu_k|  1$ for all $k$.\n\nThe derivative of the logistic map is $f'(x) = r(1-2x)$.

These correspond to perturbations that break the synchrony, associated with eigenvectors $\\mathbf{v}_k$ for $k=2, \\dots, N$ (where $\\lambda_k  0$). The mode for $k=1$ is the synchronization mode ($\\lambda_1=0$, $\\mathbf{v}_1 = \\mathbf{1}$), which corresponds to the stability of the fixed point $x^\\star$ itself.

The test cases all have $r  2$, so $2-r$ is negative. Let $\\beta = -(2-r) = r-2  0$. The condition becomes $|\\beta(1-\\varepsilon\\lambda_k)|  1$.\n$$\n-1  \\beta(1 - \\varepsilon \\lambda_k)  1 \\implies -\\frac{1}{\\beta}  1 - \\varepsilon \\lambda_k  \\frac{1}{\\beta}\n$$\n$$\n1 - \\frac{1}{\\beta}  \\varepsilon \\lambda_k  1 + \\frac{1}{\\beta}\n$$\nWe need to find the interval of $\\varepsilon \\ge 0$ that satisfies this for all $\\lambda_k$ from $\\lambda_2$ to $\\lambda_N$.\n\nWe analyze two regimes for $r2$:\nCase 1: $2  r \\le 3$. This means $0  \\beta \\le 1$, so $1/\\beta \\ge 1$.\nIn this case, $1 - 1/\\beta \\le 0$. The left side of the inequality $1-1/\\beta  \\varepsilon\\lambda_k$ is satisfied for any $\\varepsilon \\ge 0$ and $\\lambda_k  0$. The stability is only constrained by the right side:\n$$\n\\varepsilon \\lambda_k  1 + \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\implies \\varepsilon  \\frac{1 + 1/\\beta}{\\lambda_k}\n$$\nThis must hold for all $k=2, \\dots, N$. Thus, we need to satisfy the tightest constraint, which corresponds to the largest $\\lambda_k$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon  \\min_{k=2,\\dots,N} \\left( \\frac{1+1/\\beta}{\\lambda_k} \\right) = \\frac{1+1/\\beta}{\\lambda_N}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\beta=r-2$, the upper bound is $\\varepsilon_{\\text{upper}} = \\frac{1+1/(r-2)}{\\lambda_N} = \\frac{r-1}{(r-2)\\lambda_N}$. The lower bound is $\\varepsilon_{\\text{lower}} = 0$. The stability interval is $[0, \\frac{r-1}{(r-2)\\lambda_N})$.\n\nCase 2: $r  3$. This means $\\beta  1$, so $0  1/\\beta  1$.\nIn this case, $1-1/\\beta$ is positive. Both bounds on $\\varepsilon\\lambda_k$ are positive.\n$$\n\\frac{1-1/\\beta}{\\lambda_k}  \\varepsilon  \\frac{1+1/\\beta}{\\lambda_k}\n$$\nThis must hold for all $k=2, \\dots, N$. The interval for $\\varepsilon$ is the intersection of all these individual intervals.\n$$\n\\max_{k=2,\\dots,N} \\left( \\frac{1-1/\\beta}{\\lambda_k} \\right)  \\varepsilon  \\min_{k=2,\\dots,N} \\left( \\frac{1+1/\\beta}{\\lambda_k} \\right)\n$$\nThe maximum of $(1/\\lambda_k)$ occurs at the minimum $\\lambda_k$, which is $\\lambda_2$. The minimum of $(1/\\lambda_k)$ occurs at the maximum $\\lambda_k$, which is $\\lambda_N$. Since both $1-1/\\beta$ and $1+1/\\beta$ are positive, we have:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\text{lower}} = \\frac{1-1/\\beta}{\\lambda_2} = \\frac{r-3}{(r-2)\\lambda_2}\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\text{upper}} = \\frac{1+1/\\beta}{\\lambda_N} = \\frac{r-1}{(r-2)\\lambda_N}\n$$\nThe stability interval is $(\\frac{r-3}{(r-2)\\lambda_2}, \\frac{r-1}{(r-2)\\lambda_N})$. This interval is non-empty only if $\\varepsilon_{\\text{lower}}  \\varepsilon_{\\text{upper}}$. If this condition is not met, the stability interval is empty.\n\nTo summarize the computation for a given test case $(N, r, \\text{graph})$:\n1. Construct the adjacency matrix $A$ and the Laplacian $L=D-A$.\n2. Compute the eigenvalues of $L$ and identify $\\lambda_2$ (the second smallest) and $\\lambda_N$ (the largest).\n3. If $2  r \\le 3$, set $\\varepsilon_{\\text{lower}} = 0$ and $\\varepsilon_{\\text{upper}} = \\frac{r-1}{(r-2)\\lambda_N}$.\n4. If $r  3$, calculate $\\varepsilon_{\\text{lower}} = \\frac{r-3}{(r-2)\\lambda_2}$ and $\\varepsilon_{\\text{upper}} = \\frac{r-1}{(r-2)\\lambda_N}$.\n5. If $\\varepsilon_{\\text{lower}} \\ge \\varepsilon_{\\text{upper}}$, the interval is empty; set $\\varepsilon_{\\text{lower}} = 0.0$, $\\varepsilon_{\\text{upper}} = 0.0$, and $\\text{width} = 0.0$.\n6. Otherwise, calculate the width as $\\text{width} = \\varepsilon_{\\text{upper}} - \\varepsilon_{\\text{lower}}$.\n7. Return $[\\varepsilon_{\\text{lower}}, \\varepsilon_{\\text{upper}}, \\text{width}]$.",
