            "problem": "Consider an aggregate, memory-dependent update rule for a scalar macroscopic observable in a complex adaptive system, modeled as the second-order linear recurrence\n$$\ny_{t+1} \\;=\\; a\\,y_t \\;+\\; b\\,y_{t-1},\n$$\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are dimensionless real parameters encoding instantaneous response and one-step memory, respectively. Let the two-dimensional state be $\\mathbf{x}_t = (y_t, y_{t-1})^{\\top}$, so the fixed point $\\mathbf{x}^* = \\mathbf{0}$ is an equilibrium of the system. In discrete-time stability analysis for linear time-invariant systems, asymptotic stability of a fixed point is equivalent to Schur stability, meaning that all eigenvalues of the Jacobian (here, the system matrix of the linear recurrence) lie strictly inside the unit disk.\n\nUsing only foundational principles of discrete-time stability and the Jury test for degree-$2$ polynomials, perform the following:\n\n1.

            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of the stability of the fixed point $\\mathbf{x}^* = \\mathbf{0}$ for the second-order linear recurrence relation $y_{t+1} = a\\,y_t + b\\,y_{t-1}$. This analysis will be performed by deriving the conditions for Schur stability on the parameters $(a,b)$ using the Jury test, interpreting these conditions geometrically, and calculating the area of the resulting stability region.\n\nFirst, we represent the second-order recurrence relation as a first-order vector-matrix equation. Let the state vector be $\\mathbf{x}_t = (y_t, y_{t-1})^{\\top}$. The dynamics are then given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}_{t+1} = \\begin{pmatrix} y_{t+1} \\\\ y_t \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} y_t \\\\ y_{t-1} \\end{pmatrix} = A \\mathbf{x}_t\n$$\nwhere $A = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ is the system matrix, also known as the companion matrix of the characteristic polynomial.\n\nThe fixed point $\\mathbf{x}^* = \\mathbf{0}$ is asymptotically stable if and only if all eigenvalues of the matrix $A$ have a magnitude strictly less than $1$. This is the definition of Schur stability for the matrix $A$. The eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $A$ are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0$.\n$$\n\\det\\left(\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\lambda \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) = \\det\\begin{pmatrix} a-\\lambda & b \\\\ 1 & -\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = (a-\\lambda)(-\\lambda) - b = \\lambda^2 - a\\lambda - b = 0\n$$\nLet the characteristic polynomial be $P(\\lambda) = \\lambda^2 - a\\lambda - b$. For Schur stability, the roots of $P(\\lambda)$ must lie strictly inside the unit disk in the complex plane.\n\n**1. Derivation of Stability Conditions using the Jury Test**\n\nThe Jury test provides necessary and sufficient conditions for a polynomial's roots to lie within the unit disk. For a second-degree polynomial of the form $P(\\lambda) = c_2\\lambda^2 + c_1\\lambda + c_0$ with real coefficients and $c_2 > 0$, the conditions are:\n1. $P(1) > 0$\n2. $(-1)^2 P(-1) > 0$, which simplifies to $P(-1) > 0$\n3. $|c_0| < c_2$\n\nFor our characteristic polynomial $P(\\lambda) = \\lambda^2 - a\\lambda - b$, the coefficients are $c_2=1$, $c_1=-a$, and $c_0=-b$. Since $c_2=1>0$, we can apply the Jury test directly.\n\nCondition 1: $P(1) > 0$\n$$\nP(1) = 1^2 - a(1) - b = 1 - a - b > 0 \\implies a+b < 1 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad b < 1-a\n$$\n\nCondition 2: $P(-1) > 0$\n$$\nP(-1) = (-1)^2 - a(-1) - b = 1 + a - b > 0 \\implies a-b > -1 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad b < 1+a\n$$\n\nCondition 3: $|c_0| < c_2$\n$$\n|-b| < 1 \\implies |b| < 1 \\implies -1 < b < 1\n$$\n\nThus, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the asymptotic stability of the fixed point $\\mathbf{x}^* = \\mathbf{0}$ are the following three inequalities on the parameters $(a,b)$:\n1. $a+b < 1$\n2. $a-b > -1$ (or $b-a < 1$)\n3. $|b| < 1$\n\n**2. Geometric Interpretation of the Stability Region**\n\nThe set of inequalities defines a region $\\mathcal{S}$ in the $(a,b)$-plane, known as the stability region. We interpret each inequality as an open half-plane:\n- $b < 1-a$: The region below the line $b = 1-a$.\n- $b < 1+a$: The region below the line $b = 1+a$.\n- $b > -1$: The region above the line $b = -1$.\n- $b < 1$: The region below the line $b = 1$.\n\nThe stability region $\\mathcal{S}$ is the intersection of these half-planes. We can show that the condition $b<1$ is redundant. The upper boundary of the region is determined by $b < \\min(1-a, 1+a)$.\n- For $a \\ge 0$, $1-a \\le 1+a$, so the boundary is $b < 1-a$. Since $a \\ge 0$, $1-a \\le 1$, so $b<1-a$ implies $b<1$.\n- For $a < 0$, $1+a < 1-a$, so the boundary is $b < 1+a$. Since $a<0$, $1+a<1$, so $b<1+a$ implies $b<1$.\nTherefore, the inequality $b<1$ is implied by the other two upper-bound inequalities, $b < 1-a$ and $b < 1+a$.\n\nThe stability region $\\mathcal{S}$ is thus defined by the simplified set of three inequalities:\n1. $b < 1-a$\n2. $b < 1+a$\n3. $b > -1$\n\nThis region is an open triangle in the $(a,b)$-plane.\n- **Convexity**: As $\\mathcal{S}$ is the intersection of three convex sets (open half-planes), it is itself a convex set.\n- **Boundary and Vertices**: The boundaries of the region are the lines $b = 1-a$, $b = 1+a$, and $b = -1$. The vertices of the closure of $\\mathcal{S}$ are the intersection points of these lines:\n    - Intersection of $b=1-a$ and $b=1+a$:\n      $1-a = 1+a \\implies 2a=0 \\implies a=0$. Then $b=1$. Vertex is $(0,1)$.\n    - Intersection of $b=1-a$ and $b=-1$:\n      $-1 = 1-a \\implies a=2$. Vertex is $(2,-1)$.\n    - Intersection of $b=1+a$ and $b=-1$:\n      $-1 = 1+a \\implies a=-2$. Vertex is $(-2,-1)$.\nThe stability region $\\mathcal{S}$ is the interior of the triangle with vertices at $(-2, -1)$, $(2, -1)$, and $(0, 1)$.\n\n**3. Area of the Stability Region**\n\nWe compute the Lebesgue area of the triangular region $\\mathcal{S}$ in the $(a,b)$-plane. We can take the base of the triangle to be the segment connecting the vertices $(-2,-1)$ and $(2,-1)$. This segment lies on the line $b=-1$.\n- The length of the base is the difference between the $a$-coordinates:\n  $$ \\text{base} = 2 - (-2) = 4 $$\n- The height of the triangle is the perpendicular distance from the third vertex $(0,1)$ to the line containing the base, $b=-1$. This is the difference in the $b$-coordinates:\n  $$ \\text{height} = 1 - (-1) = 2 $$\n- The area of a triangle is given by the formula $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$.\n  $$ \\text{Area}(\\mathcal{S}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 \\times 2 = 4 $$\nThe exact Lebesgue area of the stability region $\\mathcal{S}$ is $4$.",

An invariant set $S$ under a map $F$ satisfies $F(S) = S$.
