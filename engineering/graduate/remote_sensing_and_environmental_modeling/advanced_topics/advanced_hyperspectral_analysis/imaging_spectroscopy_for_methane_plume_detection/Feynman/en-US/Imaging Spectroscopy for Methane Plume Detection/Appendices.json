            "problem": "An airborne imaging spectrometer targets the methane absorption complex near $2.3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.

            "solution": "The problem is found to be valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a standard exercise in remote sensing signal processing.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts: first, to compute the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for a given measurement, and second, to relate this SNR to the minimum detectable fractional radiance depression caused by methane.\n\nPart 1: Calculation of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)\n\nThe problem defines the Signal-to-Noise Ratio, denoted as $\\mathrm{SNR}$, as the ratio of the mean signal to the standard deviation of the noise.\n\nThe mean signal is the measured at-sensor radiance in the on-band channel, which is given as:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{on}} = 0.365\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{sr}^{-1}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$$\n\nThe noise is described as additive, zero-mean, and Gaussian. Its standard deviation, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{noise}}$, is given as the Noise Equivalent Delta Radiance ($\\mathrm{NE}\\Delta L$) for the channel:\n$$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{noise}} = \\mathrm{NE}\\Delta L = 8.7 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{sr}^{-1}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$$\n\nFollowing the definition provided, the $\\mathrm{SNR}$ is calculated as:\n$$\\mathrm{SNR} = \\frac{\\text{Mean Signal}}{\\text{Standard Deviation of Noise}} = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{on}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{noise}}} = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{on}}}{\\mathrm{NE}\\Delta L}$$\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$\\mathrm{SNR} = \\frac{0.365}{8.7 \\times 10^{-4}}$$\n\nThe units of radiance ($\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{sr}^{-1}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$) cancel out, leaving the $\\mathrm{SNR}$ as a dimensionless quantity (a pure number), as expected.\n\nPerforming the division:\n$$\\mathrm{SNR} = \\frac{0.365}{0.00087} \\approx 419.5402...$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures. The first three significant digits are $4$, $1$, and $9$. The fourth digit is $5$, which requires rounding up the third digit.\n$$419.5402... \\rightarrow 420$$\nThus, the Signal-to-Noise Ratio for the on-band channel is $420$.\n\nPart 2: Relationship between SNR and Minimum Detectable $\\alpha$\n\nThe problem uses a linearized form of the Beer–Lambert law to relate the on-band radiance $L_{\\mathrm{on}}$ to the continuum radiance $L_{0}$ (i.e., the radiance that would be observed in the absence of methane absorption) and the fractional radiance depression $\\alpha$:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{on}} \\approx L_{0}(1-\\alpha)$$\nwhere $0 < \\alpha \\ll 1$.\n\nThe \"signal\" of interest for methane detection is not the radiance itself, but the *change* in radiance caused by methane absorption. This change, or absorption depth, $\\Delta L$, is the difference between the continuum radiance and the on-band radiance:\n$$\\Delta L = L_{0} - L_{\\mathrm{on}}$$\nSubstituting the linearized expression for $L_{\\mathrm{on}}$:\n$$\\Delta L = L_{0} - L_{0}(1-\\alpha) = L_{0} - L_{0} + L_{0}\\alpha = L_{0}\\alpha$$\n\nTo detect this signal $\\Delta L$, it must be distinguishable from the instrument noise. A common criterion for detection is that the signal must be greater than or equal to $k$ times the standard deviation of the noise, where $k$ is a positive number representing the desired confidence level (e.g., $k=3$ for a $3$-sigma detection). The standard deviation of the noise is $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{noise}} = \\mathrm{NE}\\Delta L$.\n\nThe minimum detectable signal, $\\Delta L_{\\mathrm{min}}$, is therefore set by this threshold:\n$$\\Delta L_{\\mathrm{min}} = k \\cdot \\sigma_{\\mathrm{noise}} = k \\cdot (\\mathrm{NE}\\Delta L)$$\n\nThis corresponds to a minimum detectable fractional absorption, $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{min}}$. By substituting $\\Delta L_{\\mathrm{min}} = L_{0}\\alpha_{\\mathrm{min}}$ into the detection threshold equation, we get:\n$$L_{0}\\alpha_{\\mathrm{min}} = k \\cdot (\\mathrm{NE}\\Delta L)$$\n\nSolving for $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{min}}$ gives the lower bound on detectable $\\alpha$:\n$$\\alpha_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\frac{k \\cdot (\\mathrm{NE}\\Delta L)}{L_{0}}$$\n\nThis expression can be directly related to the SNR. Let us define the SNR of the continuum radiance as $\\mathrm{SNR}_{0} = \\frac{L_{0}}{\\mathrm{NE}\\Delta L}$. The expression for $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{min}}$ can then be rewritten as:\n$$\\alpha_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\frac{k}{\\mathrm{SNR}_{0}}$$\n\nSince the problem states that $\\alpha \\ll 1$, the on-band radiance $L_{\\mathrm{on}}$ is very close to the continuum radiance $L_{0}$ ($L_{\\mathrm{on}} \\approx L_{0}$). Consequently, the SNR calculated for the on-band measurement, $\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{on}} = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{on}}}{\\mathrm{NE}\\Delta L}$, is a very good approximation of the continuum SNR, $\\mathrm{SNR}_{0}$.\n\nTherefore, we can state the relationship as:\n$$\\alpha_{\\mathrm{min}} \\approx \\frac{k}{\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{on}}}$$\n\nThis equation demonstrates that the minimum detectable fractional absorption $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{min}}$ is inversely proportional to the Signal-to-Noise Ratio of the measurement. A higher SNR allows for the detection of a weaker methane signal (a smaller $\\alpha$) at a given statistical confidence level $k$. The SNR thus fundamentally determines the detection limit of the instrument for the targeted atmospheric constituent.",

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe physical model is based on the Beer-Lambert law. The at-sensor radiance $L$ in a spectral band is proportional to the incident radiance at the top of the absorbing layer, which we denote as $L_0$, and the atmospheric transmittance $T$ through the gas. The problem states that due to spectrally flat surface reflectance and identical illumination geometries, we can consider $L_0$ to be the same for both the on-band and off-band channels.\n\nThe band-averaged transmittance is modeled using the given effective cross-sections. The Beer-Lambert law is applied at the band-averaged level:\nThe radiance in the on-band, $L_{\\mathrm{on}}$, is given by:\n$$ L_{\\mathrm{on}} = L_0 \\, T_{\\mathrm{on}} = L_0 \\, \\exp(-\\sigma_{\\mathrm{on,eff}} N_s) = L_0 \\, \\exp(-\\sigma_{\\mathrm{on,eff}} m N) $$\nThe radiance in the off-band, $L_{\\mathrm{off}}$, is given by:\n$$ L_{\\mathrm{off}} = L_0 \\, T_{\\mathrm{off}} = L_0 \\, \\exp(-\\sigma_{\\mathrm{off,eff}} N_s) = L_0 \\, \\exp(-\\sigma_{\\mathrm{off,eff}} m N) $$\nHere, $N$ is the true column enhancement.\n\n**1. Derivation of Measured Optical Depth and Standard Retrieval**\n\nThe retrieval uses the ratio of the radiances to eliminate the unknown background radiance $L_0$. The true radiance ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{on}}}{L_{\\mathrm{off}}} = \\frac{L_0 \\, \\exp(-\\sigma_{\\mathrm{on,eff}} m N)}{L_0 \\, \\exp(-\\sigma_{\\mathrm{off,eff}} m N)} = \\exp(-(\\sigma_{\\mathrm{on,eff}} - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{off,eff}}) m N) $$\nThe measured differential optical depth, $A_{\\mathrm{meas}}$, is defined as the negative natural logarithm of this ratio:\n$$ A_{\\mathrm{meas}} = -\\ln\\left(\\frac{L_{\\mathrm{on}}}{L_{\\mathrm{off}}}\\right) = -\\ln\\left(\\exp(-(\\sigma_{\\mathrm{on,eff}} - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{off,eff}}) m N)\\right) $$\n$$ A_{\\mathrm{meas}} = (\\sigma_{\\mathrm{on,eff}} - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{off,eff}}) m N $$\nThis is the expression for the differential optical depth.\n\nThe standard retrieval method operates under the simplifying assumption that there is no methane absorption in the off-band, which means it assumes $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{off,eff}} = 0$. In this simplified model, the relationship between the measured optical depth and the *estimated* column enhancement, $\\hat{N}$, is:\n$$ A_{\\mathrm{meas}} = (\\sigma_{\\mathrm{on,eff}} - 0) m \\hat{N} = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{on,eff}} m \\hat{N} $$\nSolving for the estimated column enhancement $\\hat{N}$ gives the standard retrieval formula:\n$$ \\hat{N} = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{meas}}}{m \\, \\sigma_{\\mathrm{on,eff}}} $$\n\n**2. Derivation of Fractional Bias $\\beta$**\n\nTo find the bias, we equate the true physical expression for $A_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ with the expression used by the standard retrieval to interpret it:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{on,eff}} m \\hat{N} = (\\sigma_{\\mathrm{on,eff}} - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{off,eff}}) m N $$\nThe air mass factor $m$ is non-zero and cancels from both sides:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{on,eff}} \\hat{N} = (\\sigma_{\\mathrm{on,eff}} - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{off,eff}}) N $$\nSolving for the estimated quantity $\\hat{N}$ in terms of the true quantity $N$:\n$$ \\hat{N} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{on,eff}} - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{off,eff}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{on,eff}}} N = \\left(1 - \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{off,eff}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{on,eff}}}\\right) N $$\nThe fractional bias $\\beta$ is defined as $\\beta = (\\hat{N} - N)/N$. Substituting the expression for $\\hat{N}$:\n$$ \\beta = \\frac{\\left(1 - \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{off,eff}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{on,eff}}}\\right) N - N}{N} = \\frac{N \\left( \\left(1 - \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{off,eff}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{on,eff}}}\\right) - 1 \\right)}{N} $$\nSimplifying the expression yields the fractional bias:\n$$ \\beta = - \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{off,eff}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{on,eff}}} $$\n\n**3. Unbiased Correction Formula for $N$**\n\nAn unbiased retrieval formula for $N$ must account for the off-band absorption. This is achieved by using the correct physical relationship derived in Part 1:\n$$ A_{\\mathrm{meas}} = (\\sigma_{\\mathrm{on,eff}} - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{off,eff}}) m N $$\nSolving this equation for the true column enhancement $N$ gives the unbiased correction formula:\n$$ N_{\\mathrm{corrected}} = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{meas}}}{m (\\sigma_{\\mathrm{on,eff}} - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{off,eff}})} $$\nThis formula correctly uses the *differential* effective cross-section $(\\sigma_{\\mathrm{on,eff}} - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{off,eff}})$ to retrieve an unbiased estimate of $N$ from the measured differential optical depth $A_{\\mathrm{meas}}$, provided that accurate values for both $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{on,eff}}$ and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{off,eff}}$ are supplied by a line-by-line (LBL) model.\n\n**4. Numerical Calculation of Bias $\\Delta N$**\n\nThe absolute bias is $\\Delta N = \\hat{N} - N$. Using the relationship derived in Part 2, this is equivalent to $\\Delta N = \\beta N$.\n$$ \\Delta N = \\left(- \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{off,eff}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{on,eff}}}\\right) N $$\nWe are given the following numerical values:\n- $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{on,eff}} = 4.0 \\times 10^{-22}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{2}\\,molecule^{-1}}$\n- $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{off,eff}} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{2}\\,molecule^{-1}}$\n- $N = 3.0 \\times 10^{24}\\,\\mathrm{molecules\\,m^{-2}}$\n\nNote that the units for the cross-sections ($\\mathrm{cm^2}$) and column enhancement ($\\mathrm{m^2}$) are different, but this is not an issue for the bias calculation, as the ratio of cross-sections is dimensionless. The unit of $\\Delta N$ will be the same as that of $N$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the ratio of the cross-sections:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{off,eff}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{on,eff}}} = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{-23}}{4.0 \\times 10^{-22}} = \\frac{1.5}{40.0} = 0.0375 $$\nNow, we calculate the absolute bias $\\Delta N$:\n$$ \\Delta N = -0.0375 \\times (3.0 \\times 10^{24}\\,\\mathrm{molecules\\,m^{-2}}) $$\n$$ \\Delta N = -0.1125 \\times 10^{24}\\,\\mathrm{molecules\\,m^{-2}} $$\nExpressing this in standard scientific notation:\n$$ \\Delta N = -1.125 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{molecules\\,m^{-2}} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ \\Delta N \\approx -1.13 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{molecules\\,m^{-2}} $$\nThe negative sign indicates that the standard retrieval, which ignores off-band absorption, underestimates the true methane column enhancement.",

It is a standard Gaussian integral of the form $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-ax^2) dx = \\sqrt{\\pi/a}$. For the $x'$ integral, the coefficient $a_x$ is:\n$$\na_x = \\frac{1}{2\\sigma_{x}^{2}} + \\frac{1}{2s_{x}^{2}} = \\frac{s_{x}^{2} + \\sigma_{x}^{2}}{2\\sigma_{x}^{2}s_{x}^{2}}\n$$\nThe value of the $x'$ integral is therefore:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-a_x x'^{2}) \\,dx' = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{a_x}} = \\sqrt{\\pi \\frac{2\\sigma_{x}^{2}s_{x}^{2}}{s_{x}^{2} + \\sigma_{x}^{2}}} = \\sqrt{2\\pi} \\frac{\\sigma_{x}s_{x}}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_{x}^{2} + s_{x}^{2}}}\n$$\nBy analogy, the value of the $y'$ integral is:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-a_y y'^{2}) \\,dy' = \\sqrt{2\\pi} \\frac{\\sigma_{y}s_{y}}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_{y}^{2} + s_{y}^{2}}}\n$$\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for $\\Delta X_{\\mathrm{meas}}(0,0)$:\n$$\n\\Delta X_{\\mathrm{meas}}(0,0) = \\frac{\\Delta X_{0}}{2\\pi s_{x} s_{y}} \\left( \\sqrt{2\\pi} \\frac{\\sigma_{x}s_{x}}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_{x}^{2} + s_{x}^{2}}} \\right) \\left( \\sqrt{2\\pi} \\frac{\\sigma_{y}s_{y}}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_{y}^{2} + s_{y}^{2}}} \\right)\n$$\nSimplifying the expression:\n$$\n\\Delta X_{\\mathrm{meas}}(0,0) = \\frac{\\Delta X_{0}}{2\\pi s_{x} s_{y}} (2\\pi) \\frac{\\sigma_{x}s_{x}}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_{x}^{2} + s_{x}^{2}}} \\frac{\\sigma_{y}s_{y}}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_{y}^{2} + s_{y}^{2}}}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta X_{\\mathrm{meas}}(0,0) = \\Delta X_{0} \\frac{\\sigma_{x}}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_{x}^{2} + s_{x}^{2}}} \\frac{\\sigma_{y}}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_{y}^{2} + s_{y}^{2}}}\n$$\nThe attenuation factor $R$ is obtained by dividing by $\\Delta X_{0}$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\Delta X_{\\mathrm{meas}}(0,0)}{\\Delta X_{0}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{x}}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_{x}^{2} + s_{x}^{2}}} \\frac{\\sigma_{y}}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_{y}^{2} + s_{y}^{2}}}\n$$\nThis can also be written as:\n$$\nR = \\left(1 + \\frac{s_{x}^{2}}{\\sigma_{x}^{2}}\\right)^{-1/2} \\left(1 + \\frac{s_{y}^{2}}{\\sigma_{y}^{2}}\\right)^{-1/2}\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the attenuation factor.\n\nNext, we evaluate $R$ numerically.
