            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of optical remote sensing, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We can therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe problem asks to compute the spatial misregistration, $\\delta x$, at a specific wavelength using a given model for keystone distortion in a hyperspectral spectrometer. It also asks for an assessment of the need for subpixel resampling based on the result.\n\nFirst, we calculate the spatial misregistration. The keystone-induced spatial shift, $\\delta x(\\lambda)$, relative to a reference wavelength $\\lambda_0$ is given by the second-order polynomial:\n$$\n\\delta x(\\lambda)=k_{1}\\,(\\lambda-\\lambda_{0})+k_{2}\\,(\\lambda-\\lambda_{0})^{2}\n$$\n\nThe given parameters are:\n-   Reference wavelength: $\\lambda_{0}=500\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\n-   Target wavelength: $\\lambda=900\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\n-   Linear coefficient: $k_{1}=0.002\\,\\mathrm{pix}/\\mathrm{nm}$\n-   Quadratic coefficient: $k_{2}=1.0\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{pix}/\\mathrm{nm}^{2}$\n\nThe first step is to calculate the wavelength offset from the reference wavelength:\n$$\n\\Delta\\lambda = \\lambda - \\lambda_{0} = 900\\,\\mathrm{nm} - 500\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 400\\,\\mathrm{nm}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values and the calculated wavelength offset into the model equation for $\\delta x(\\lambda)$:\n$$\n\\delta x(900\\,\\mathrm{nm}) = (0.002\\,\\mathrm{pix}/\\mathrm{nm})(400\\,\\mathrm{nm}) + (1.0\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{pix}/\\mathrm{nm}^{2})(400\\,\\mathrm{nm})^{2}\n$$\n\nWe can compute the contribution from the linear and quadratic terms separately.\nThe linear term is:\n$$\n\\delta x_{1} = k_{1}\\,\\Delta\\lambda = 0.002 \\times 400 = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{pixels}\n$$\nThe quadratic term is:\n$$\n\\delta x_{2} = k_{2}\\,(\\Delta\\lambda)^{2} = (1.0\\times 10^{-6}) \\times (400)^{2} = (1.0\\times 10^{-6}) \\times 160000 = 0.16\\,\\mathrm{pixels}\n$$\n\nThe total spatial misregistration is the sum of these two components:\n$$\n\\delta x = \\delta x_{1} + \\delta x_{2} = 0.8 + 0.16 = 0.96\\,\\mathrm{pixels}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value of $0.96$ has two significant figures. To express this value with four significant figures as requested, we write it as $0.9600$.\n$$\n\\delta x(900\\,\\mathrm{nm}) = 0.9600\\,\\mathrm{pixels}\n$$\n\nNext, we address the second part of the problem: assessing the need for subpixel resampling.\nThe problem states that this assessment should be made based on whether the magnitude of the misregistration exceeds $0.5$ pixels. Our calculated misregistration at $\\lambda=900\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ is $|\\delta x| = 0.9600$ pixels. Since\n$$\n0.9600 > 0.5\n$$\nthe misregistration exceeds the specified threshold, indicating that a correction is required.\n\nThe reasoning for this threshold and the need for correction is grounded in sampling theory and the instrument's spatial resolution. The instrument's point spread function (PSF) has a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of approximately one pixel. This means a pixel represents the fundamental spatial sampling interval of the detector. The Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem implies that to avoid aliasing and accurately represent a signal, the sampling interval must be sufficiently small relative to the variations in the signal being measured.\n\nIn the context of band-to-band co-registration, the goal is to ensure that for any given spatial pixel index $(i,j)$ in the hyperspectral data cube, the recorded spectrum corresponds to the same location on the ground for all wavelengths. A keystone-induced shift of $\\delta x = 0.9600$ pixels means that the detector element recording the radiance at $\\lambda=900\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ is viewing a ground location that is shifted by nearly a full pixel width from the ground location viewed by the corresponding detector element at the reference wavelength $\\lambda_0=500\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nThis large a shift introduces significant spectral errors. The spectrum associated with a given pixel becomes a composite of information from different ground locations, a phenomenon known as spectral mixing or misregistration artifact. A common rule of thumb in remote sensing, derived from sampling theory, is that misregistration should be kept below a fraction of a pixel, typically in the range of $0.1$ to $0.3$ pixels, to maintain data integrity. A threshold of $0.5$ pixels is a firm upper limit; any misregistration exceeding this value means that the center of a sample in one band has shifted into the spatial domain of an adjacent sample in another band, which is a severe form of spatial-spectral aliasing.\n\nTherefore, to correct for this misregistration of $0.9600$ pixels and achieve accurate band-to-band co-registration, a numerical process is required to remap the image data from the distorted wavelength-dependent grid onto a common, rectified spatial grid. Since the required shift is a fraction of a pixel (even though it is close to one), this process involves interpolation between pixel values, which is known as subpixel resampling.",

The observed spectrum contains a single, isolated absorption feature whose intrinsic line shape can be modeled as Gaussian with FWHM $W_{\\mathrm{line}}=10\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. Across the $N$ columns, the center wavelength drifts linearly due to spectral smile, producing a peak-to-peak shift $S$ over the field of view. Assume spatial-spectral aberrations (keystone) and additive path radiance from cirrus adjacency are both negligible due to prior correction, so that smile is the dominant residual artifact.\n\nWhen generating a level-$2$ product on a fixed wavelength grid, column-wise spectra are co-registered to a common mean grid and averaged across columns. Under these conditions, treat the smile-induced shifts across columns as a uniform distribution on $[-S/2,\\,S/2]$ that contributes an effective broadening via convolution with the intrinsic line and the instrument line shape. Use the following two scientific criteria to determine the maximum tolerable smile $S_{\\max}$ so that the absorption line remains resolvable without appreciable bias:\n\n- Broadening criterion: The total FWHM of the observed line (after averaging across columns in the presence of smile) must not exceed the no-smile total FWHM by more than $5\\%$.\n- Sampling consistency criterion: To prevent inter-band misassignment under nearest-center discretization on the fixed grid, require that the maximum deviation from the mean center wavelength, $S/2$, not exceed half the sampling interval, $\\Delta\\lambda/2$.\n\nStarting from first principles of convolution for independent broadening sources and the definition of the Gaussian FWHM, derive $S_{\\max}$ and compute its numerical value for the given instrument and line parameters.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is based on established principles of optics and signal processing used in hyperspectral remote sensing. All necessary parameters are provided, and the problem structure leads to a unique, meaningful solution. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution can be constructed.\n\nThe primary objective is to find the maximum tolerable smile, $S_{\\max}$, which must satisfy two independent criteria: a broadening criterion and a sampling consistency criterion. The final value for $S_{\\max}$ will be the most restrictive of the two, i.e., the minimum of the maximum values allowed by each criterion.\n\nLet's analyze each criterion separately.\n\nFirst, we establish the baseline case with no spectral smile ($S=0$). The observed spectral line shape is the result of the convolution of the intrinsic absorption line shape and the instrument line shape (ILS). Both are given as Gaussian functions. A fundamental property of the convolution of two Gaussian functions is that the result is another Gaussian function. If the two initial Gaussians have full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of $W_1$ and $W_2$, the FWHM of the resulting convolved Gaussian, $W_{\\text{res}}$, is given by the quadrature sum:\n$$\nW_{\\text{res}}^2 = W_1^2 + W_2^2\n$$\nIn our case, the intrinsic line FWHM is $W_{\\text{line}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and the ILS FWHM is $W_{\\text{ILS}} = 8\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. Thus, the FWHM of the observed line in the absence of smile, denoted $W_{\\text{total, no smile}}$, is:\n$$\nW_{\\text{total, no smile}}^2 = W_{\\text{line}}^2 + W_{\\text{ILS}}^2 = (10\\,\\mathrm{nm})^2 + (8\\,\\mathrm{nm})^2 = 100\\,\\mathrm{nm}^2 + 64\\,\\mathrm{nm}^2 = 164\\,\\mathrm{nm}^2\n$$\n$$\nW_{\\text{total, no smile}} = \\sqrt{164}\\,\\mathrm{nm}\n$$\n\nNext, we incorporate the effect of spectral smile. The smile is modeled as a uniform distribution of spectral shifts over the interval $[-S/2, S/2]$. When spectra from all columns are averaged, this distribution of shifts acts as an additional broadening function, which convolves with the no-smile line shape. The total observed profile with smile is the convolution of three independent functions: the intrinsic line shape (Gaussian), the ILS (Gaussian), and the smile broadening function (uniform/rectangular).\n\nAccording to the convolution theorem, the variance of a sum of independent random variables is the sum of their variances. The broadening of a spectral line by convolution can be analyzed by adding the variances of the corresponding line shape functions.\nThe relationship between the FWHM ($W$) and the standard deviation ($\\sigma$) of a Gaussian function is $W = 2\\sqrt{2\\ln(2)}\\sigma$. This implies that the variance $\\sigma^2$ is related to the FWHM by $\\sigma^2 = W^2 / (8\\ln(2))$.\nThe variance of a uniform distribution over the interval $[a, b]$ is $(b-a)^2 / 12$. For the smile distribution on $[-S/2, S/2]$, the variance $\\sigma_{\\text{smile}}^2$ is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{smile}}^2 = \\frac{(S/2 - (-S/2))^2}{12} = \\frac{S^2}{12}\n$$\nThe total variance of the observed profile with smile, $\\sigma_{\\text{total, with smile}}^2$, is the sum of the variances of the convolved components:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{total, with smile}}^2 = \\sigma_{\\text{total, no smile}}^2 + \\sigma_{\\text{smile}}^2\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_{\\text{total, no smile}}^2$ is the variance of the Gaussian profile without smile, which is $\\frac{W_{\\text{total, no smile}}^2}{8\\ln(2)}$.\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{total, with smile}}^2 = \\frac{W_{\\text{total, no smile}}^2}{8\\ln(2)} + \\frac{S^2}{12}\n$$\nThe convolution of a Gaussian with a uniform distribution results in a profile that is no longer strictly Gaussian. However, a standard and effective approximation in instrumental physics is to treat the FWHM of the resulting profile, $W_{\\text{total, with smile}}$, as if it were a Gaussian with the total variance calculated above. This approximation is particularly accurate when the Gaussian component is dominant.\n$$\nW_{\\text{total, with smile}}^2 \\approx 8\\ln(2) \\sigma_{\\text{total, with smile}}^2 = 8\\ln(2) \\left( \\frac{W_{\\text{total, no smile}}^2}{8\\ln(2)} + \\frac{S^2}{12} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nW_{\\text{total, with smile}}^2 \\approx W_{\\text{total, no smile}}^2 + \\frac{8\\ln(2)}{12}S^2 = W_{\\text{total, no smile}}^2 + \\frac{2\\ln(2)}{3}S^2\n$$\n\nWith this expression, we can apply the two criteria.\n\n**Criterion 1: Broadening Criterion**\nThe total FWHM with smile must not exceed the no-smile total FWHM by more than $5\\%$.\n$$\nW_{\\text{total, with smile}} \\le 1.05 \\times W_{\\text{total, no smile}}\n$$\nSquaring both sides of the inequality to work with our derived expression:\n$$\nW_{\\text{total, with smile}}^2 \\le (1.05)^2 W_{\\text{total, no smile}}^2 = 1.1025 W_{\\text{total, no smile}}^2\n$$\nSubstituting our approximation for $W_{\\text{total, with smile}}^2$:\n$$\nW_{\\text{total, no smile}}^2 + \\frac{2\\ln(2)}{3}S^2 \\le 1.1025 W_{\\text{total, no smile}}^2\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{2\\ln(2)}{3}S^2 \\le 0.1025 W_{\\text{total, no smile}}^2\n$$\n$$\nS^2 \\le \\frac{3 \\times 0.1025}{2\\ln(2)} W_{\\text{total, no smile}}^2\n$$\nLet's denote the maximum smile allowed by this criterion as $S_1$.\n$$\nS_1^2 = \\frac{0.3075}{2\\ln(2)} \\times 164\\,\\mathrm{nm}^2\n$$\n$$\nS_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.3075 \\times 164}{2\\ln(2)}} \\,\\mathrm{nm} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{50.43}{1.38629}}\\,\\mathrm{nm} \\approx \\sqrt{36.376}\\,\\mathrm{nm} \\approx 6.031\\,\\mathrm{nm}\n$$\n\n**Criterion 2: Sampling Consistency Criterion**\nThis criterion requires that the maximum wavelength deviation from the mean, which is $S/2$, not exceed half the spectral sampling interval, $\\Delta\\lambda/2$.\n$$\n\\frac{S}{2} \\le \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{2}\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\nS \\le \\Delta\\lambda\n$$\nGiven $\\Delta\\lambda = 5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, the maximum smile allowed by this criterion, $S_2$, is:\n$$\nS_2 = 5\\,\\mathrm{nm}\n$$\n\n**Final Determination of $S_{\\max}$**\nThe hyperspectral instrument must satisfy both criteria simultaneously.
