The concept of NESZ is a fundamental performance metric for any SAR system, representing the sensitivity limit.

The use of decibels (dB) is standard practice in these fields for handling the large dynamic range of signal powers.\n\nThe problem is well-posed. It provides a clear definition of NESZ and the mathematical relationship between the relevant quantities, both in linear and logarithmic scales. The statement \"products in linear scale become sums in decibel scale\" correctly describes the property of logarithms and guides the formulation of the model in the dB domain. The problem defines a calibration constant $C$ that relates the input ($\\sigma^0$) to the output (received power) in the decibel domain, implying an additive relationship, which is consistent with the logarithmic transformation of a product. All information required for both the derivation and the numerical calculation is provided.

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nLet $P_{rec, lin}$ be the received power from a distributed target in linear units (e.g., Watts), and let $\\sigma^{0}_{lin}$ be the normalized radar cross section in linear, dimensionless units. According to fundamental (i), they are related by a proportionality constant $K$:\n$$P_{rec, lin} = K \\cdot \\sigma^{0}_{lin}$$\nThe constant $K$ encapsulates all system and geometric factors, and has units of power (e.g., Watts).\n\nWe convert this relationship to the decibel (dB) scale using the transformation given in fundamental (ii). The power in decibels relative to $1$ Watt (dBW) is denoted $P_{dBW}$ and is given by $P_{dBW} = 10 \\log_{10}(P_{lin})$. The backscatter coefficient in decibels is denoted $\\sigma^{0}_{dB}$ and is given by $\\sigma^{0}_{dB} = 10 \\log_{10}(\\sigma^{0}_{lin})$.\n\nApplying the logarithmic transformation to the linear equation:\n$$10 \\log_{10}(P_{rec, lin}) = 10 \\log_{10}(K \\cdot \\sigma^{0}_{lin})$$\nLet $P_{rec, dBW} = 10 \\log_{10}(P_{rec, lin})$. Using the property of logarithms that $\\log(a \\cdot b) = \\log(a) + \\log(b)$:\n$$P_{rec, dBW} = 10 \\log_{10}(K) + 10 \\log_{10}(\\sigma^{0}_{lin})$$\nSubstituting the definition of $\\sigma^{0}_{dB}$:\n$$P_{rec, dBW} = 10 \\log_{10}(K) + \\sigma^{0}_{dB}$$\nThe problem defines a radiometric calibration constant $C$ in dB that maps $\\sigma^{0}$ to the received power in decibel scale. This implies that $C$ is the additive term in the decibel-domain equation. Therefore, we identify $C$ as:\n$$C = 10 \\log_{10}(K)$$\nThe relationship between the received power and the backscatter coefficient in the decibel domain is thus:\n$$P_{rec, dBW} = \\sigma^{0}_{dB} + C$$\n\nThe Noise-Equivalent Sigma Nought (NESZ) is defined as the value of $\\sigma^{0}$ for which the received power equals the receiver noise floor, $P_{n}$. Let us denote the NESZ in decibels as $\\sigma^{0}_{NESZ, dB}$. At this limit, the signal power is equal to the noise power:\n$$P_{rec, dBW} = P_{n}$$\nSubstituting this condition into our radiometric equation:\n$$P_{n} = \\sigma^{0}_{NESZ, dB} + C$$\nSolving for $\\sigma^{0}_{NESZ, dB}$, we obtain the general expression for the minimum detectable $\\sigma^{0}$ in decibels:\n$$\\sigma^{0}_{NESZ, dB} = P_{n} - C$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we must compute the numerical value of $\\sigma^{0}_{NESZ, dB}$ using the provided system parameters: a receiver noise floor of $P_{n} = -100$ dBW and a radiometric calibration constant of $C = -50$ dB.\nSubstituting these values into our derived expression:\n$$\\sigma^{0}_{NESZ, dB} = (-100) - (-50)$$\n$$\\sigma^{0}_{NESZ, dB} = -100 + 50$$\n$$\\sigma^{0}_{NESZ, dB} = -50$$\nThe minimum detectable $\\sigma^{0}$ for this system is $-50$ dB.",

The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the WCM Expression\nThe Water Cloud Model (WCM) describes the total backscatter coefficient, $\\sigma^{0}$, as an incoherent sum of the contribution from the vegetation volume, $\\sigma^{0}_{\\text{veg\\_contrib}}$, and the contribution from the underlying soil surface, $\\sigma^{0}_{\\text{soil\\_contrib}}$, which is attenuated by the vegetation layer.\n$$\n\\sigma^{0} = \\sigma^{0}_{\\text{veg\\_contrib}} + \\sigma^{0}_{\\text{soil\\_contrib}}\n$$\nThe soil contribution consists of the soil backscatter, $\\sigma^{0}_{\\text{soil}}$, attenuated by a two-way path through the canopy. The two-way transmissivity of the canopy is denoted by $\\gamma^{2}$.\n$$\n\\sigma^{0}_{\\text{soil\\_contrib}} = \\sigma^{0}_{\\text{soil}} \\gamma^{2}\n$$\nThe vegetation is modeled as a collection of scatterers. The backscatter from an infinitely thick (optically dense) canopy is $\\sigma^{0}_{\\text{veg}}$. For a canopy of finite thickness, its contribution is proportional to the energy scattered within the canopy, which is the fraction of energy not transmitted through it. This fraction is $(1 - \\gamma^{2})$. Thus, the vegetation contribution is:\n$$\n\\sigma^{0}_{\\text{veg\\_contrib}} = \\sigma^{0}_{\\text{veg}} (1 - \\gamma^{2})\n$$\nCombining these terms gives the full WCM equation:\n$$\n\\sigma^{0} = \\sigma^{0}_{\\text{veg}} (1 - \\gamma^{2}) + \\sigma^{0}_{\\text{soil}} \\gamma^{2}\n$$\nThe two-way transmissivity, $\\gamma^{2}$, is derived from the Beer–Lambert law. The one-way attenuation path is the slant path through the canopy. If the canopy vertical height is $h$, the slant path length is $h / \\cos(\\theta)$. The one-way nadir optical depth is $\\tau$. The optical depth along the slant path is therefore $\\tau / \\cos(\\theta)$. The one-way transmissivity is:\n$$\n\\gamma = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\tau}{\\cos(\\theta)}\\right)\n$$\nThe two-way transmissivity, for the signal traveling down to the ground and back up to the sensor, is:\n$$\n\\gamma^{2} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\tau}{\\cos(\\theta)}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that for HV polarization in forests, the soil contribution is negligible. This implies we set the term $\\sigma^{0}_{\\text{soil\\_contrib}} = 0$. The model simplifies to:\n$$\n\\sigma^{0} = \\sigma^{0}_{\\text{veg\\_contrib}} = \\sigma^{0}_{\\text{veg}} (1 - \\gamma^{2})\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\gamma^{2}$, we obtain the final derived expression for the HV-polarized backscatter:\n$$\n\\sigma^{0} = \\sigma^{0}_{\\text{veg}} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\tau}{\\cos(\\theta)}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the task.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nThe next step is to compute the numerical value of $\\sigma^{0}$ using the provided parameters. All calculations involving $\\sigma^{0}$ must be performed in linear scale, not in decibels (dB).\n\nThe given values are:\n- $\\theta = 35^\\circ$\n- $\\sigma^{0}_{\\text{veg}} = -12$ dB\n- $\\tau = 0.8$\n\nFirst, convert the vegetation asymptotic backscatter $\\sigma^{0}_{\\text{veg}}$ from dB to a linear unitless value.

The validation of the problem statement confirms that it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n### Part 1: Explanation of Bias\n\nThe core of the issue lies in the non-linear nature of the logarithmic transformation used to convert from linear power units ($\\sigma^{0}$) to decibels ($\\sigma^{0}_{\\text{dB}}$). The transformation is given by $\\sigma^{0}_{\\text{dB}} = 10 \\log_{10} \\sigma^{0}$. The logarithm function is strictly concave.\n\nAccording to Jensen's inequality, for a strictly concave function $f$ and a non-constant random variable $X$, the following inequality holds:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[f(X)] < f(\\mathbb{E}[X]) $$\nIn our context, the function is $f(X) = 10 \\log_{10}(X)$, which is strictly concave. The multiplicative speckle $X$ is a random variable. Therefore, applying Jensen's inequality gives:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[10 \\log_{10}(X)] < 10 \\log_{10}(\\mathbb{E}[X]) $$\nThis inequality is the fundamental source of the bias. To see how it affects biomass estimation, let's compare two data processing workflows.\n\n**Workflow 1: Averaging in the linear domain.**\nIn this approach, one first averages the observed linear backscatter values, $\\sigma^{0}_{\\text{obs}}$, over an area of interest (e.g., a forest stand) to get an estimate of the expected backscatter, $\\mathbb{E}[\\sigma^{0}_{\\text{obs}}]$.\nThe observed backscatter is modeled as $\\sigma^{0}_{\\text{obs}} = \\sigma^{0}_{\\text{true}} \\cdot X$. Taking the expectation, and using the independence of the true signal $\\sigma^{0}_{\\text{true}}$ and speckle $X$, we get:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[\\sigma^{0}_{\\text{obs}}] = \\mathbb{E}[\\sigma^{0}_{\\text{true}} \\cdot X] = \\mathbb{E}[\\sigma^{0}_{\\text{true}}] \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[X] $$\nAssuming $\\sigma^{0}_{\\text{true}}$ is constant for a given biomass $B$ within the averaging area, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[\\sigma^{0}_{\\text{obs}}] = \\sigma^{0}_{\\text{true}} \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[X] $$\nThis means that the average observed backscatter is directly proportional to the true backscatter. The factor of proportionality, $\\mathbb{E}[X]$, is a constant determined by the speckle statistics. A model relating biomass $B$ to this averaged quantity, e.g., $B = f(\\mathbb{E}[\\sigma^{0}_{\\text{obs}}])$, is essentially relating biomass to a scaled version of the true physical quantity, $B = f(\\sigma^{0}_{\\text{true}} \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[X])$. This preserves the functional form of the underlying biophysical relationship, and a simple scaling is often absorbed into the model's fitted parameters. This is why this approach is said to \"avoid bias\". If one were to use decibels for visualization or modeling after averaging, the conversion would be $10 \\log_{10}(\\mathbb{E}[\\sigma^{0}_{\\text{obs}}])$.\n\n**Workflow 2: Averaging in the decibel domain.**\nIn this approach, each pixel's backscatter is first converted to decibels, $\\sigma^{0}_{\\text{obs,dB}} = 10 \\log_{10}(\\sigma^{0}_{\\text{obs}})$, and then these decibel values are averaged to get an estimate of $\\mathbb{E}[\\sigma^{0}_{\\text{obs,dB}}]$.\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[\\sigma^{0}_{\\text{obs,dB}}] = \\mathbb{E}[10 \\log_{10}(\\sigma^{0}_{\\text{obs}})] = \\mathbb{E}[10 \\log_{10}(\\sigma^{0}_{\\text{true}} \\cdot X)] $$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this becomes:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[\\sigma^{0}_{\\text{obs,dB}}] = \\mathbb{E}[10 \\log_{10}(\\sigma^{0}_{\\text{true}}) + 10 \\log_{10}(X)] $$\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[\\sigma^{0}_{\\text{obs,dB}}] = 10 \\log_{10}(\\sigma^{0}_{\\text{true}}) + \\mathbb{E}[10 \\log_{10}(X)] $$\nHere, a model relating biomass $B$ to $\\mathbb{E}[\\sigma^{0}_{\\text{obs,dB}}]$ is relating $B$ to the true decibel value plus an additive term, $\\mathbb{E}[10 \\log_{10}(X)]$.\n\n**The Bias:**\nThe bias arises when comparing the results of these two workflows. The quantity $\\Delta_{\\text{dB}}$ defined in the problem is precisely the difference between the expectation of the log-transformed variable and the log-transformation of the expected variable (scaled by $10$):\n$$ \\Delta_{\\text{dB}} = \\mathbb{E}[10 \\log_{10}(X)] - 10 \\log_{10}(\\mathbb{E}[X]) $$\nFrom Jensen's inequality, we know that $\\Delta_{\\text{dB}} < 0$. This shows that averaging in the decibel domain (the first term, in essence) results in a systematically lower value than averaging in the linear domain and then converting to decibels (the second term, in essence). This systematic underestimation is the \"bias\" introduced by speckle when working in the decibel domain. By performing aggregation in the linear domain, one estimates a quantity, $\\mathbb{E}[\\sigma^0_{\\text{obs}}]$, that is linearly and unbiasedly related to $\\sigma^0_{\\text{true}}$ (up to a constant scale factor $\\mathbb{E}[X]$), thus avoiding the non-linear distortion and bias introduced by an early logarithmic transformation.\n\n### Part 2: Derivation of the Bias Expression\n\nWe need to derive a closed-form expression for $\\Delta_{\\text{dB}}$:\n$$ \\Delta_{\\text{dB}} = \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[10 \\log_{10} X\\right] - 10 \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\mathbb{E}[X]\\right) $$\nIt is more convenient to work with the natural logarithm, $\\ln$, because the speckle distribution is defined in terms of it. We use the change of base formula, $\\log_{10}(z) = \\frac{\\ln(z)}{\\ln(10)}$.\n$$ \\Delta_{\\text{dB}} = 10 \\left( \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{\\ln X}{\\ln(10)}\\right] - \\frac{\\ln(\\mathbb{E}[X])}{\\ln(10)} \\right) = \\frac{10}{\\ln(10)} \\left( \\mathbb{E}[\\ln X] - \\ln(\\mathbb{E}[X]) \\right) $$\nLet's evaluate the two terms inside the parenthesis separately.\n\n1.  **Calculate $\\mathbb{E}[\\ln X]$**:\n    We are given that the random variable $Y = \\ln X$ follows a normal distribution, $Y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^{2})$. The expectation of a normally distributed variable is its mean.\n    $$ \\mathbb{E}[\\ln X] = \\mathbb{E}[Y] = \\mu $$\n\n2.  **Calculate $\\ln(\\mathbb{E}[X])$**:\n    First, we need to find the expectation of the log-normal random variable $X$. Since $X = e^Y$, we have:\n    $$ \\mathbb{E}[X] = \\mathbb{E}[e^Y] $$\n    This is the definition of the moment-generating function (MGF) of the normal random variable $Y$, $M_Y(t) = \\mathbb{E}[e^{tY}]$, evaluated at $t=1$. The MGF for $Y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^{2})$ is:\n    $$ M_Y(t) = \\exp\\left(\\mu t + \\frac{\\sigma^{2}t^{2}}{2}\\right) $$\n    Evaluating at $t=1$:\n    $$ \\mathbb{E}[X] = M_Y(1) = \\exp\\left(\\mu(1) + \\frac{\\sigma^{2}(1)^{2}}{2}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\mu + \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{2}\\right) $$\n    Now, we take the natural logarithm of this result:\n    $$ \\ln(\\mathbb{E}[X]) = \\ln\\left(\\exp\\left(\\mu + \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{2}\\right)\\right) = \\mu + \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{2} $$\n\n3.  **Combine the terms**:\n    Substitute the results for $\\mathbb{E}[\\ln X]$ and $\\ln(\\mathbb{E}[X])$ back into the expression for $\\Delta_{\\text{dB}}$:\n    $$ \\Delta_{\\text{dB}} = \\frac{10}{\\ln(10)} \\left( \\mu - \\left(\\mu + \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{2}\\right) \\right) $$\n    $$ \\Delta_{\\text{dB}} = \\frac{10}{\\ln(10)} \\left( \\mu - \\mu - \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{2} \\right) $$\n    $$ \\Delta_{\\text{dB}} = \\frac{10}{\\ln(10)} \\left( -\\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{2} \\right) $$\n    $$ \\Delta_{\\text{dB}} = -\\frac{5\\sigma^{2}}{\\ln(10)} $$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the bias. It is expressed in decibels and depends only on the variance $\\sigma^{2}$ of the log-transformed speckle and the fundamental constant $\\ln(10)$. The parameter $\\mu$ cancels out. As $\\sigma^{2} > 0$ for any non-constant speckle, the bias $\\Delta_{\\text{dB}}$ is strictly negative, consistent with Jensen's inequality.",
