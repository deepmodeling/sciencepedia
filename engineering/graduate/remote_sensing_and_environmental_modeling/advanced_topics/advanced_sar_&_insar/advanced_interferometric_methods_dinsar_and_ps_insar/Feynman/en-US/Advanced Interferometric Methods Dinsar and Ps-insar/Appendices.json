            "problem": "A Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) measurement isolates surface deformation by differencing the interferometric phase between two Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) acquisitions after removing topographic, orbital, and flat-Earth contributions. Consider a point target that is also suitable for Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PS-InSAR) analysis, observed with otherwise identical geometry using two radar bands: L-band with wavelength $\\lambda_{L} = 0.24\\ \\mathrm{m}$ and C-band with wavelength $\\lambda_{C} = 0.056\\ \\mathrm{m}$. Suppose that after all non-deformation terms are removed, the residual interferometric phase attributable to deformation is $\\Delta \\phi = \\pi/3\\ \\mathrm{rad}$ for both bands.\n\nStarting from the fundamental two-way phase–range relation for a monostatic radar and the definition of interferometric phase difference for two acquisitions, derive the mapping from interferometric phase $\\Delta \\phi$ to line-of-sight displacement $d$ (assume small displacements along the radar line-of-sight and neglect atmospheric and ionospheric contributions). Then compute the line-of-sight displacement magnitudes corresponding to $\\Delta \\phi = \\pi/3\\ \\mathrm{rad}$ for L-band and C-band, expressing each displacement in $\\mathrm{mm}$ and rounding each to three significant figures.\n\nFinally, analyze the implications for measurement sensitivity by discussing how the wavelength affects the conversion from phase noise to displacement noise. To concretize the analysis, assume a phase standard deviation $\\sigma_{\\phi} = 0.10\\ \\mathrm{rad}$ for a single interferogram over a coherent persistent scatterer, and compute the corresponding displacement standard deviation at each band (express in $\\mathrm{mm}$, three significant figures).\n\nProvide as your final reported answer the numerical value of the ratio of the two displacement magnitudes $d_{L}/d_{C}$ for the same $\\Delta \\phi$ (unitless), rounded to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the relationship between interferometric phase and line-of-sight displacement, followed by calculations for specific radar bands and an analysis of measurement sensitivity.\n\nFirst, we derive the mapping from interferometric phase $\\Delta \\phi$ to line-of-sight (LOS) displacement $d$. The phase $\\phi$ of a signal received by a monostatic radar from a point target at a slant range $R$ is proportional to the total two-way path length traveled by the signal, which is $2R$. The relationship is given by:\n$$ \\phi = \\frac{2 \\pi}{\\lambda} (2R) = \\frac{4 \\pi R}{\\lambda} $$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the radar wavelength.\n\nFor an interferometric measurement, we consider two Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) acquisitions at times $t_1$ and $t_2$. The corresponding ranges to the target are $R_1$ and $R_2$. The phases for each acquisition are:\n$$ \\phi_1 = \\frac{4 \\pi R_1}{\\lambda} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\phi_2 = \\frac{4 \\pi R_2}{\\lambda} $$\nThe raw interferometric phase, $\\Delta\\phi_{\\mathrm{raw}}$, is the difference between these two phases:\n$$ \\Delta\\phi_{\\mathrm{raw}} = \\phi_2 - \\phi_1 = \\frac{4 \\pi}{\\lambda} (R_2 - R_1) $$\nThis raw phase is a composite of several contributions, including those from the satellite's orbit (the \"flat-Earth\" phase), the surface topography, atmospheric and ionospheric path delays, and any surface deformation that occurred between the acquisitions. The problem states that a Differential InSAR (DInSAR) process has been applied, meaning the topographic, orbital, and flat-Earth contributions have been removed. We are also instructed to neglect atmospheric and ionospheric effects. Therefore, the residual interferometric phase, $\\Delta\\phi$, is due solely to the change in the satellite-to-ground range caused by surface deformation along the LOS. If we denote this displacement by $d$, then the change in range is $R_2 - R_1 = d$. The relationship simplifies to:\n$$ \\Delta \\phi = \\frac{4 \\pi d}{\\lambda} $$\nThis is the fundamental equation linking the differential interferometric phase to the LOS displacement. To find the displacement $d$ as a function of the phase $\\Delta \\phi$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$ d = \\frac{\\lambda \\Delta \\phi}{4 \\pi} $$\nThis completes the required derivation.\n\nNext, we compute the LOS displacement magnitudes for L-band and C-band. We are given the wavelengths $\\lambda_{L} = 0.24\\ \\mathrm{m}$ and $\\lambda_{C} = 0.056\\ \\mathrm{m}$. The residual phase due to deformation is stated to be $\\Delta \\phi = \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\ \\mathrm{rad}$ for both bands.\n\nFor L-band, the displacement $d_{L}$ is:\n$$ d_{L} = \\frac{\\lambda_{L} \\Delta \\phi}{4 \\pi} = \\frac{(0.24\\ \\mathrm{m}) \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)}{4 \\pi} = \\frac{0.24}{12}\\ \\mathrm{m} = 0.02\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\nConverting to millimeters, this is $20\\ \\mathrm{mm}$. To express this to $3$ significant figures as requested, we write $d_{L} = 20.0\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nFor C-band, the displacement $d_{C}$ is:\n$$ d_{C} = \\frac{\\lambda_{C} \\Delta \\phi}{4 \\pi} = \\frac{(0.056\\ \\mathrm{m}) \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)}{4 \\pi} = \\frac{0.056}{12}\\ \\mathrm{m} \\approx 0.004666...\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\nConverting to millimeters and rounding to $3$ significant figures, we get $d_{C} \\approx 4.67\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nThe problem then asks for an analysis of measurement sensitivity. The derived relationship $d = \\frac{\\lambda}{4\\pi}\\Delta\\phi$ shows that for a given phase change $\\Delta\\phi$, the corresponding displacement $d$ is directly proportional to the wavelength $\\lambda$. This implies that radar systems using shorter wavelengths are more sensitive to displacement; a smaller physical displacement is needed to produce the same phase difference. Consequently, C-band is more sensitive to small deformations than L-band.\n\nTo quantify this, we analyze the effect of phase noise on the displacement measurement. Assuming the phase measurement for a coherent persistent scatterer is subject to noise with a standard deviation $\\sigma_{\\phi}$, we can find the corresponding standard deviation of the displacement, $\\sigma_{d}$, by propagating the uncertainty through the linear relationship $d(\\Delta\\phi)$:\n$$ \\sigma_{d}^{2} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial d}{\\partial \\Delta\\phi} \\right)^{2} \\sigma_{\\phi}^{2} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{d} = \\left| \\frac{\\partial d}{\\partial \\Delta\\phi} \\right| \\sigma_{\\phi} = \\left| \\frac{\\lambda}{4\\pi} \\right| \\sigma_{\\phi} = \\frac{\\lambda}{4\\pi} \\sigma_{\\phi} $$\nThis result confirms that the precision of the displacement measurement is inversely proportional to the wavelength's inverse (i.e., directly proportional to the wavelength). For a given phase noise $\\sigma_{\\phi}$, a shorter wavelength $\\lambda$ results in a smaller displacement uncertainty $\\sigma_{d}$, corresponding to higher precision.\n\nWe are given $\\sigma_{\\phi} = 0.10\\ \\mathrm{rad}$. We compute the displacement standard deviation for each band.\n\nFor L-band:\n$$ \\sigma_{d,L} = \\frac{\\lambda_{L} \\sigma_{\\phi}}{4\\pi} = \\frac{(0.24\\ \\mathrm{m})(0.10)}{4\\pi} = \\frac{0.024}{4\\pi}\\ \\mathrm{m} \\approx 0.00190986\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\nConverting to millimeters and rounding to $3$ significant figures, this is $\\sigma_{d,L} \\approx 1.91\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nFor C-band:\n$$ \\sigma_{d,C} = \\frac{\\lambda_{C} \\sigma_{\\phi}}{4\\pi} = \\frac{(0.056\\ \\mathrm{m})(0.10)}{4\\pi} = \\frac{0.0056}{4\\pi}\\ \\mathrm{m} \\approx 0.00044563\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\nConverting to millimeters and rounding to $3$ significant figures, this is $\\sigma_{d,C} \\approx 0.446\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\nThese calculations clearly show that the C-band measurement is more precise.\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio of the displacement magnitudes $d_{L} / d_{C}$ for the same phase difference $\\Delta\\phi$. This ratio quantifies how much larger the displacement measured by L-band is compared to C-band for the same observed phase change.\n$$ \\frac{d_{L}}{d_{C}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\lambda_{L} \\Delta \\phi}{4 \\pi}}{\\frac{\\lambda_{C} \\Delta \\phi}{4 \\pi}} = \\frac{\\lambda_{L}}{\\lambda_{C}} $$\nThe ratio is independent of the phase difference and depends only on the ratio of the wavelengths. Substituting the given values:\n$$ \\frac{d_{L}}{d_{C}} = \\frac{0.24\\ \\mathrm{m}}{0.056\\ \\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{240}{56} = \\frac{30}{7} \\approx 4.285714... $$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, as requested for the final answer:\n$$ \\frac{d_{L}}{d_{C}} \\approx 4.286 $$",
