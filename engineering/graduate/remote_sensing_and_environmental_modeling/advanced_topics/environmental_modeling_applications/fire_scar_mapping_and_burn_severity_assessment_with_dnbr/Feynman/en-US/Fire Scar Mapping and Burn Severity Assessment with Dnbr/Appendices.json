            "problem": "A satellite wildfire assessment relies on atmospherically corrected surface reflectance measurements to quantify changes in vegetation and substrate following a burn. Consider a single pixel observed by a multispectral sensor before and after a fire. The bidirectional surface reflectance factors (unitless, scaled between $0$ and $1$) in the Near-Infrared (NIR) and Shortwave Infrared band centered near $2.2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ (Shortwave Infrared $2$, SWIR2) are provided as $(R_{NIR}, R_{SWIR2})_{pre} = (0.45, 0.08)$ and $(R_{NIR}, R_{SWIR2})_{post} = (0.12, 0.28)$. The Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) is a normalized difference index constructed to emphasize the contrast between high NIR reflectance from healthy vegetation and heightened SWIR2 absorption/scattering from char, exposed soil, and reduced moisture, and the Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) is defined as the time-differenced change in that index between pre-fire and post-fire epochs. Using the conceptual basis that normalized difference indices are formed to be dimensionless, illumination-invariant contrasts of two bands, derive from first principles the appropriate normalized difference expression for this case, formulate its time-differenced change, and compute the numerical value of the dNBR for the given pixel. Briefly interpret the magnitude in terms of expected burn severity and biophysical change, referencing widely used severity categorization practices by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), while noting that thresholds may be ecosystem-dependent.\n\nExpress the final computed dNBR as a unitless number and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The foundational elements in satellite-based burn severity assessment begin with surface reflectance, which is the ratio of upwelling radiance leaving the surface to the downwelling irradiance incident upon it, corrected for atmospheric effects. Healthy vegetation typically exhibits high reflectance in the Near-Infrared (NIR) due to internal leaf structure and multiple scattering, and relatively lower reflectance in the Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) bands due to strong absorption by water in leaves and soils. Conversely, burned areas tend to show reduced NIR reflectance due to canopy consumption and structural damage, and increased SWIR reflectance due to water loss, char, ash, and exposed mineral soils.\n\nTo construct an index that is dimensionless and relatively invariant to multiplicative illumination changes, remote sensing commonly employs normalized difference indices that contrast two spectral bands. The general normalized difference between two positive quantities $X$ and $Y$ is defined as\n$$\nI(X,Y) = \\frac{X - Y}{X + Y},\n$$\nwhich is bounded between $-1$ and $1$ when $X, Y > 0$. For the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), the two bands are selected as NIR and SWIR2 to accentuate vegetation moisture and structure changes:\n$$\n\\mathrm{NBR} = \\frac{R_{NIR} - R_{SWIR2}}{R_{NIR} + R_{SWIR2}}.\n$$\nThe time-differenced change in this index between pre-fire and post-fire dates is the Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), defined as\n$$\n\\mathrm{dNBR} = \\mathrm{NBR}_{pre} - \\mathrm{NBR}_{post},\n$$\na convention chosen so that positive values indicate a decrease in NBR from pre- to post-fire conditions consistent with burn impacts (lower $R_{NIR}$ and higher $R_{SWIR2}$ post-fire).\n\nWe first compute the pre-fire NBR using the provided reflectances:\n$$\n\\mathrm{NBR}_{pre} = \\frac{R_{NIR,pre} - R_{SWIR2,pre}}{R_{NIR,pre} + R_{SWIR2,pre}} = \\frac{0.45 - 0.08}{0.45 + 0.08} = \\frac{0.37}{0.53}.\n$$\nSymbolically, this ratio simplifies numerically as\n$$\n\\mathrm{NBR}_{pre} = \\frac{0.37}{0.53} \\approx 0.6981132075\\ldots.\n$$\nNext, compute the post-fire NBR:\n$$\n\\mathrm{NBR}_{post} = \\frac{R_{NIR,post} - R_{SWIR2,post}}{R_{NIR,post} + R_{SWIR2,post}} = \\frac{0.12 - 0.28}{0.12 + 0.28} = \\frac{-0.16}{0.40} = -0.4.\n$$\nNow form the differenced index:\n$$\n\\mathrm{dNBR} = \\mathrm{NBR}_{pre} - \\mathrm{NBR}_{post} = 0.6981132075\\ldots - (-0.4) = 1.0981132075\\ldots.\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures, the dNBR is\n$$\n\\mathrm{dNBR} \\approx 1.098.\n$$\n\nInterpretation of magnitude: Because $\\mathrm{NBR}_{pre}$ is high and positive, indicating vigorous vegetation with strong $R_{NIR}$ and weak $R_{SWIR2}$, and $\\mathrm{NBR}_{post}$ is negative, indicating substantial decrease in $R_{NIR}$ and increase in $R_{SWIR2}$ consistent with canopy loss, water loss, and char/ash, the resulting $\\mathrm{dNBR} \\approx 1.098$ is large. Note that while individual NBR values are bounded between $-1$ and $1$, their difference $\\mathrm{dNBR}$ can range up to $2$ in principle. In widely used United States Geological Survey (USGS) severity categorization schemes, positive dNBR values above approximately $0.66$ are typically associated with high burn severity, with lower ranges delineating moderate-high, moderate-low, and low severity classes. Therefore, a value near $1.10$ is indicative of very high severity, consistent with extensive canopy consumption and substantial biophysical alteration. Thresholds can vary by ecosystem and sensor preprocessing, so local calibration may refine classification boundaries, but the magnitude here robustly indicates severe burn impacts.",

This confirms the decision rule is a single threshold on $X$. Solving for the threshold $t$:\n$$t = \\frac{\\mu_{\\mathcal{L}}^2 - \\mu_{\\mathcal{U}}^2}{2(\\mu_{\\mathcal{L}} - \\mu_{\\mathcal{U}})} + \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{2(\\mu_{\\mathcal{L}} - \\mu_{\\mathcal{U}})} \\ln\\left(\\frac{c_{\\mathcal{L} \\mid \\mathcal{U}} \\pi_{\\mathcal{U}}}{c_{\\mathcal{U} \\mid \\mathcal{L}} \\pi_{\\mathcal{L}}}\\right)$$\n$$t = \\frac{(\\mu_{\\mathcal{L}} - \\mu_{\\mathcal{U}})(\\mu_{\\mathcal{L}} + \\mu_{\\mathcal{U}})}{2(\\mu_{\\mathcal{L}} - \\mu_{\\mathcal{U}})} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\mu_{\\mathcal{L}} - \\mu_{\\mathcal{U}}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{c_{\\mathcal{L} \\mid \\mathcal{U}} \\pi_{\\mathcal{U}}}{c_{\\mathcal{U} \\mid \\mathcal{L}} \\pi_{\\mathcal{L}}}\\right)$$\n$$t = \\frac{\\mu_{\\mathcal{L}} + \\mu_{\\mathcal{U}}}{2} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\mu_{\\mathcal{L}} - \\mu_{\\mathcal{U}}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{c_{\\mathcal{L} \\mid \\mathcal{U}} \\pi_{\\mathcal{U}}}{c_{\\mathcal{U} \\mid \\mathcal{L}} \\pi_{\\mathcal{L}}}\\right)$$\nThis is the analytical expression for the Bayes-optimal threshold. Now, we substitute the given numerical values: $\\mu_{\\mathcal{U}} = 0.08$, $\\mu_{\\mathcal{L}} = 0.28$, $\\sigma = 0.06$, $\\pi_{\\mathcal{U}} = 0.70$, $\\pi_{\\mathcal{L}} = 0.30$, $c_{\\mathcal{L} \\mid \\mathcal{U}} = 1$, and $c_{\\mathcal{U} \\mid \\mathcal{L}} = 2$.\n\n$$t = \\frac{0.28 + 0.08}{2} + \\frac{(0.06)^2}{0.28 - 0.08} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 \\cdot 0.70}{2 \\cdot 0.30}\\right)$$\n$$t = \\frac{0.36}{2} + \\frac{0.0036}{0.20} \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.7}{0.6}\\right)$$\n$$t = 0.18 + 0.018 \\ln\\left(\\frac{7}{6}\\right)$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{7}{6}\\right) \\approx 0.15415068$$\n$$t \\approx 0.18 + 0.018 \\times 0.15415068$$\n$$t \\approx 0.18 + 0.00277471224$$\n$$t \\approx 0.18277471224$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the threshold value is $0.1828$. The Bayes-optimal rule is to predict 'low severity' if the observed dNBR value $X$ is greater than or equal to $0.1828$, and 'unburned' otherwise.",
