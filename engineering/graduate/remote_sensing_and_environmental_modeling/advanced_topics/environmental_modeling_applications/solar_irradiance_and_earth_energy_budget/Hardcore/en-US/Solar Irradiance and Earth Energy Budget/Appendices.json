            "problem": "You are tasked with deriving and implementing a physically rigorous model of clear-sky, top-of-atmosphere (TOA) daily insolation based on spherical geometry. Begin from fundamental geometric and kinematic principles and do not assume any pre-derived day length or daily-mean insolation formulas.\n\nStarting point and assumptions:\n- Represent the Earth as a perfect sphere with axial tilt accounted for by the solar declination angle. Neglect atmospheric refraction and attenuation. The instantaneous TOA solar irradiance on a horizontal surface is $I(t) = S_0 \\max\\{0,\\cos \\theta_z(t)\\}$, where $S_0$ is the solar constant and $\\theta_z$ is the solar zenith angle.\n- Use the unit-sphere dot-product relation for the solar zenith angle: construct Earth-centered unit vectors for the Sun direction and the local zenith at latitude $\\varphi$ and solar declination $\\delta$, with an hour angle $h$ that increases uniformly due to Earth’s rotation. From spherical geometry of the celestial sphere and the definition of latitude and declination, the cosine of the solar zenith angle satisfies $\\cos \\theta_z(h) = \\sin \\varphi \\,\\sin \\delta + \\cos \\varphi \\,\\cos \\delta \\,\\cos h$.\n- The Earth’s rotation is uniform with angular speed $\\omega_s = 2\\pi/86400$ in units of $\\mathrm{rad\\,s^{-1}}$, so $\\mathrm{d}t = \\mathrm{d}h/\\omega_s$, with $h$ expressed in radians.\n- The Sun is above the horizon if and only if $\\cos \\theta_z(h) > 0$. Sunrise and sunset occur at $\\cos \\theta_z(h_0) = 0$. The day length in hours is determined by the measure of the hour angle interval for which $\\cos \\theta_z(h) > 0$ and the rotation rate.\n\nTasks:\n1. Using only the principles above, derive the day length as a function of latitude $\\varphi$ and solar declination $\\delta$ by solving for the sunrise/sunset hour angle $h_0$ from the horizon condition $\\cos \\theta_z(h_0) = 0$. Carefully handle the three regimes implied by the spherical geometry constraint on $h_0$: normal days, continuous daylight (polar day), and continuous darkness (polar night).\n2. Using the derived $h_0$, analytically integrate the instantaneous irradiance $I(t)$ over daylight hours to obtain the daily-integrated TOA insolation $E_{\\mathrm{day}}(\\varphi,\\delta,S_0)$ in $\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-2}\\,day^{-1}}$. Express your final result in $\\mathrm{MJ\\,m^{-2}\\,day^{-1}}$ by dividing by $10^{6}$. You must take care to express the time integral as an integral over the hour angle $h$, using $\\mathrm{d}t = \\mathrm{d}h/\\omega_s$, and respect the correct limits implied by the day length regimes.\n3. Implement a program that, for each test case below, computes:\n   - The day length $L$ in hours, rounded to $6$ decimal places.\n   - The daily-integrated TOA insolation $E_{\\mathrm{day}}$ in $\\mathrm{MJ\\,m^{-2}\\,day^{-1}}$, rounded to $6$ decimal places.\n   Use double-precision floating point arithmetic. Input angles are provided in degrees and must be converted to radians internally. Take $S_0$ as provided in the test suite. Ignore Earth–Sun distance variations, i.e., treat the orbit as circular with constant $S_0$.\n\nAngle units:\n- All inputs for latitude $\\varphi$ and declination $\\delta$ are in degrees. Internally convert to radians for all trigonometric operations. The hour angle $h$ must be treated in radians.\n\nPhysical units:\n- Report $L$ in hours.\n- Report $E_{\\mathrm{day}}$ in $\\mathrm{MJ\\,m^{-2}\\,day^{-1}}$.\n\nEdge cases and physical realism:\n- Your derivation must identify and correctly handle polar day (continuous daylight) and polar night (continuous darkness) conditions implied by the spherical geometry condition on sunrise and sunset. Assume no atmospheric refraction, so the geometric horizon defines sunrise/sunset.\n- The algorithm must be robust to boundary cases where the transition between regimes occurs.\n\nTest suite:\n- Use the following parameter sets, each specified as $(\\varphi,\\delta,S_0)$ with $\\varphi$ and $\\delta$ in degrees and $S_0$ in $\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$:\n  - Case $1$: $(0.0^{\\circ}, 0.0^{\\circ}, 1361.0\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}})$\n  - Case $2$: $(45.0^{\\circ}, 23.44^{\\circ}, 1361.0\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}})$\n  - Case $3$: $(45.0^{\\circ}, -23.44^{\\circ}, 1361.0\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}})$\n  - Case $4$: $(75.0^{\\circ}, 23.44^{\\circ}, 1361.0\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}})$\n  - Case $5$: $(75.0^{\\circ}, -23.44^{\\circ}, 1361.0\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}})$\n  - Case $6$: $(66.56^{\\circ}, 23.44^{\\circ}, 1361.0\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}})$\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list of lists, in the order of the test cases above.

            "solution": "The user-provided problem statement is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of spherical astronomy and radiative transfer, is well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and is expressed in objective, formal language. The tasks are a standard and non-trivial exercise in atmospheric physics and remote sensing, requiring rigorous derivation from first principles.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first deriving the day length $L$ and then the daily-integrated insolation $E_{\\mathrm{day}}$.\n\n### 1. Derivation of Day Length\n\nThe instantaneous solar irradiance on a horizontal surface at the top of the atmosphere is given by $I(t) = S_0 \\max\\{0, \\cos \\theta_z(t)\\}$, where $S_0$ is the solar constant and $\\theta_z$ is the solar zenith angle. The Sun is above the horizon when $\\cos \\theta_z > 0$. The cosine of the solar zenith angle is given as a function of latitude $\\varphi$, solar declination $\\delta$, and hour angle $h$:\n$$ \\cos \\theta_z(h) = \\sin \\varphi \\sin \\delta + \\cos \\varphi \\cos \\delta \\cos h $$\nAll angles ($\\varphi$, $\\delta$, $h$) are in radians for calculations.\n\nSunrise and sunset occur when the solar disk is at the geometric horizon, i.e., $\\theta_z = \\pi/2$, which corresponds to $\\cos \\theta_z = 0$. Let $h_0$ be the magnitude of the hour angle at sunrise and sunset (with solar noon at $h=0$, sunrise is at $-h_0$ and sunset is at $+h_0$). Setting $\\cos \\theta_z(h_0) = 0$ yields:\n$$ \\sin \\varphi \\sin \\delta + \\cos \\varphi \\cos \\delta \\cos h_0 = 0 $$\nSolving for $\\cos h_0$, assuming $\\cos \\varphi \\neq 0$ (i.e., not at the poles) and $\\cos \\delta \\neq 0$ (i.e., not at the equinoxes, though the formula holds), we get:\n$$ \\cos h_0 = -\\frac{\\sin \\varphi \\sin \\delta}{\\cos \\varphi \\cos \\delta} = -\\tan \\varphi \\tan \\delta $$\nThe sunrise/sunset hour angle is thus $h_0 = \\arccos(-\\tan \\varphi \\tan \\delta)$. The value $h_0$ represents half the angular path of the Sun above the horizon. The total duration of daylight spans an angle of $2h_0$. Earth’s rotation rate is $\\omega_s = 2\\pi / T_{\\text{day}}$, where $T_{\\text{day}} = 86400 \\, \\mathrm{s}$. The day length in hours, $L$, is:\n$$ L = \\frac{2 h_0}{\\omega_s} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\mathrm{hr}}{3600 \\, \\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{2 h_0}{2\\pi / 86400} \\times \\frac{1}{3600} = \\frac{86400}{3600} \\frac{h_0}{\\pi} = \\frac{24}{\\pi} h_0 $$\nThe argument of the arccosine function, which we denote as $X = -\\tan \\varphi \\tan \\delta$, must lie in the range $[-1, 1]$ for a real solution for $h_0$ to exist. This constraint defines three distinct physical regimes:\n\n1.  **Normal Day/Night ($ -1 < X < 1 $)**: A unique sunrise and sunset occur. The sunrise/sunset hour angle is $h_0 = \\arccos(X)$, which is in the range $(0, \\pi)$. The day length is $L = \\frac{24}{\\pi}\\arccos(-\\tan \\varphi \\tan \\delta)$ hours, with $0 < L < 24$.\n\n2.  **Polar Day / Continuous Daylight ($ X \\le -1 $)**: This occurs when $\\tan \\varphi \\tan \\delta \\ge 1$. In this case, $\\cos \\theta_z(h)$ is always positive, meaning the Sun never sets. The hour angle for which the sun is up spans the full circle, so we take $h_0 = \\pi$. This results in a day length of $L = \\frac{24}{\\pi}(\\pi) = 24$ hours. This condition, $\\tan \\varphi \\tan \\delta \\ge 1$, is equivalent to $\\cos(\\varphi+\\delta) \\le 0$ (assuming $\\cos\\varphi\\cos\\delta>0$), which signifies that the sun at midnight ($h=\\pi$, minimum elevation) is still above or at the horizon.\n\n3.  **Polar Night / Continuous Darkness ($ X \\ge 1 $)**: This occurs when $-\\tan \\varphi \\tan \\delta \\ge 1$. In this case, $\\cos \\theta_z(h)$ is always non-positive, meaning the Sun never rises. There are no daylight hours, so we take $h_0 = 0$. This results in a day length of $L = 0$ hours. This condition, $-\\tan \\varphi \\tan \\delta \\ge 1$, is equivalent to $\\cos(\\varphi-\\delta) \\le 0$, which signifies that the sun at noon ($h=0$, maximum elevation) is still at or below the horizon.\n\n### 2. Derivation of Daily-Integrated Insolation\n\nThe daily-integrated TOA insolation, $E_{\\mathrm{day}}$, is the integral of the instantaneous irradiance $I(t)$ over the daylight hours of a single day.\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{day}} = \\int_{\\text{daylight}} I(t) \\, \\mathrm{d}t = \\int_{\\text{daylight}} S_0 \\cos \\theta_z(t) \\, \\mathrm{d}t $$\nUsing the relation $\\mathrm{d}t = \\mathrm{d}h / \\omega_s$, we can transform the integral into the hour angle domain. The integration limits correspond to sunrise ($-h_0$) and sunset ($+h_0$).\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{day}} = \\int_{-h_0}^{+h_0} S_0 \\left( \\sin \\varphi \\sin \\delta + \\cos \\varphi \\cos \\delta \\cos h \\right) \\frac{\\mathrm{d}h}{\\omega_s} $$\nThe integrand is an even function of $h$. We can simplify the integral:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{day}} = \\frac{2S_0}{\\omega_s} \\int_{0}^{h_0} \\left( \\sin \\varphi \\sin \\delta + \\cos \\varphi \\cos \\delta \\cos h \\right) \\mathrm{d}h $$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{day}} = \\frac{2S_0}{\\omega_s} \\left[ h \\sin \\varphi \\sin \\delta + \\sin h \\cos \\varphi \\cos \\delta \\right]_{0}^{h_0} $$\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{day}} = \\frac{2S_0}{\\omega_s} \\left( h_0 \\sin \\varphi \\sin \\delta + \\sin h_0 \\cos \\varphi \\cos \\delta \\right) $$\nSubstituting $\\omega_s = 2\\pi / T_{\\text{day}}$ (with $T_{\\text{day}} = 86400 \\, \\mathrm{s}$), we obtain the final expression in units of $\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-2}}$:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{day}} = \\frac{S_0 T_{\\text{day}}}{\\pi} \\left( h_0 \\sin \\varphi \\sin \\delta + \\sin h_0 \\cos \\varphi \\cos \\delta \\right) $$\nThis single formula is valid for all three regimes by using the appropriate value of $h_0$:\n- For a normal day, $h_0 = \\arccos(-\\tan \\varphi \\tan \\delta)$.\n- For polar day, $h_0 = \\pi$. The formula simplifies to $E_{\\mathrm{day}} = S_0 T_{\\text{day}} \\sin \\varphi \\sin \\delta$.\n- For polar night, $h_0 = 0$. The formula simplifies to $E_{\\mathrm{day}} = 0$.\n\nTo express the result in megajoules per square meter per day ($\\mathrm{MJ\\,m^{-2}\\,day^{-1}}$), we divide by $10^6$.\n\n### 3. Algorithmic Implementation\n\nThe computational algorithm for a given set of parameters $(\\varphi_{\\text{deg}}, \\delta_{\\text{deg}}, S_0)$ is as follows:\n1.  Convert latitude $\\varphi_{\\text{deg}}$ and declination $\\delta_{\\text{deg}}$ from degrees to radians: $\\varphi = \\varphi_{\\text{deg}} \\frac{\\pi}{180}$ and $\\delta = \\delta_{\\text{deg}} \\frac{\\pi}{180}$.\n2.  Calculate the argument for the arccosine: $X = -\\tan \\varphi \\tan \\delta$.\n3.  To robustly handle the three regimes and potential floating-point inaccuracies near the boundaries, clip the value of $X$ to the valid range $[-1, 1]$.\n4.  Calculate the sunrise/sunset hour angle: $h_0 = \\arccos(\\text{clip}(X, -1, 1))$. This single operation correctly yields $h_0=0$ for polar night, $h_0=\\pi$ for polar day, and the appropriate intermediate value for a normal day.\n5.  Calculate the day length in hours: $L = \\frac{24}{\\pi} h_0$.\n6.  Calculate the daily-integrated insolation in $\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-2}}$: $E_{\\text{J/m}^2} = \\frac{S_0 \\cdot 86400}{\\pi} (h_0 \\sin \\varphi \\sin \\delta + \\sin h_0 \\cos \\varphi \\cos \\delta)$.\n7.  Convert insolation to $\\mathrm{MJ\\,m^{-2}\\,day^{-1}}$: $E_{\\mathrm{day}} = E_{\\text{J/m}^2} / 10^6$.\n8.  Round both $L$ and $E_{\\mathrm{day}}$ to $6$ decimal places as specified.\n\nThis procedure is implemented in the provided Python code.",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard problem in atmospheric radiative transfer based on the Beer-Lambert-Bouguer law. All necessary data are provided, and the assumptions are physically appropriate for this context.\n\nThe physical principle governing the attenuation of direct solar radiation through the atmosphere is the Beer-Lambert-Bouguer law. This law is derived from the principle of conservation of radiant energy for a beam passing through a medium that scatters and/or absorbs radiation. For a monochromatic beam of spectral irradiance $I_{\\lambda}$, the differential change $dI_{\\lambda}$ over a differential path length $ds$ is proportional to the irradiance itself:\n$$dI_{\\lambda} = - \\sigma_{e,\\lambda} I_{\\lambda} ds$$\nwhere $\\sigma_{e,\\lambda}$ is the volume extinction coefficient at wavelength $\\lambda$. The negative sign indicates that the irradiance is attenuated (decreases) along the path. The problem states that in-beam emission and other source terms are negligible at the given wavelength of $\\lambda = 675\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, which justifies this formulation.\n\nIntegrating this differential equation from the Top of the Atmosphere (TOA), where the irradiance is $I_{0,\\lambda}$, to the surface, where it is $I_{\\lambda}$, along the slant path $s$ through the atmosphere yields:\n$$I_{\\lambda} = I_{0,\\lambda} \\exp\\left(-\\int_{path} \\sigma_{e,\\lambda} ds\\right)$$\nThe integral in the exponent is the total optical depth along the slant path.\n\nThe problem specifies a horizontally homogeneous, plane-parallel atmosphere. In this model, the slant path optical depth is related to the vertical optical depth, $\\tau_{\\lambda}$, by the geometric air mass, $m$. The vertical optical depth (or optical thickness) is defined as the integral of the extinction coefficient over the entire vertical column of the atmosphere:\n$$\\tau_{\\lambda} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\sigma_{e,\\lambda}(z) dz$$\nwhere $z$ is the vertical coordinate. The slant path optical depth is then given by $m \\tau_{\\lambda}$. Substituting this into the integrated law gives the equation for direct normal irradiance at the surface:\n$$I_{\\lambda} = I_{0,\\lambda} \\exp(-m \\tau_{\\lambda})$$\nThis equation connects the measured irradiance at the surface ($I_{\\lambda}$) to the known extraterrestrial irradiance ($I_{0,\\lambda}$), the geometry of the path ($m$), and the quantity we wish to find, the spectral optical depth ($\\tau_{\\lambda}$).\n\nTo derive the expression for $\\tau_{\\lambda}$, we rearrange the equation algebraically.\nFirst, divide by $I_{0,\\lambda}$:\n$$\\frac{I_{\\lambda}}{I_{0,\\lambda}} = \\exp(-m \\tau_{\\lambda})$$\nNext, take the natural logarithm of both sides to eliminate the exponential function:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{I_{\\lambda}}{I_{0,\\lambda}}\\right) = -m \\tau_{\\lambda}$$\nFinally, we solve for $\\tau_{\\lambda}$:\n$$\\tau_{\\lambda} = -\\frac{1}{m} \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_{\\lambda}}{I_{0,\\lambda}}\\right)$$\nThis can also be written using the property of logarithms $\\ln(a/b) = -\\ln(b/a)$:\n$$\\tau_{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{m} \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_{0,\\lambda}}{I_{\\lambda}}\\right)$$\nThis is the desired expression for the spectral optical depth in terms of the given quantities.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $\\tau_{\\lambda}$ using the provided data:\n-   $I_{\\lambda} = 0.95\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,nm^{-1}}$\n-   $I_{0,\\lambda} = 1.50\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,nm^{-1}}$\n-   $m = 2.05$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$\\tau_{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{2.05} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1.50}{0.95}\\right)$$\n$$\\tau_{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{2.05} \\ln(1.578947...)$$\n$$\\tau_{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{2.05} (0.456740...)$$\n$$\\tau_{\\lambda} \\approx 0.2227999...$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the spectral optical depth is:\n$$\\tau_{\\lambda} \\approx 0.2228$$\n\nThe physical meaning of the spectral optical depth, $\\tau_{\\lambda}$, is that it is a dimensionless measure of the total atmospheric transparency in the vertical direction (i.e., for an observer looking straight up at the zenith) at a specific wavelength $\\lambda$. It quantifies the total attenuation (due to both scattering and absorption) experienced by a beam of radiation passing vertically through the entire atmosphere. A larger value of $\\tau_{\\lambda}$ implies a more opaque atmosphere and greater attenuation, while a value near zero would imply a nearly transparent atmosphere.\n\nIn this context, $\\tau_{\\lambda} = 0.2228$ at $\\lambda = 675\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ represents the combined extinction from molecular (Rayleigh) scattering and aerosol scattering and absorption under the observed clear-sky conditions.\n\nThe fraction of energy transmitted vertically through the atmosphere (i.e., if the sun were at the zenith, with $m=1$) is given by the transmittance, $T_{\\lambda} = \\exp(-\\tau_{\\lambda})$.

The remaining $20.0\\%$ is attenuated, being either scattered out of the direct beam or absorbed by atmospheric constituents. For the actual observation with air mass $m = 2.05$, the transmittance along the slant path is $\\exp(-m \\tau_{\\lambda}) = \\exp(-2.05 \\times 0.2228) \\approx 0.633$, which is precisely the ratio $I_{\\lambda}/I_{0,\\lambda} = 0.95/1.50$.",

            "problem": "A homogeneous, plane-parallel aerosol layer in a cloud-free atmosphere scatters incident solar radiation according to the Henyey–Greenstein phase function, which is a probability density per unit solid angle defined on the unit sphere. Let the scattering angle be $\\theta$ (measured in radians) and define $\\mu = \\cos(\\theta)$. The phase function is\n$$\np(\\mu) = \\frac{1 - g^{2}}{4\\pi \\left(1 + g^{2} - 2 g \\mu\\right)^{3/2}},\n$$\nwhere $g \\in (-1,1)$ is the asymmetry parameter, and $p(\\mu)$ is normalized so that $\\int_{4\\pi} p(\\mu)\\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega = 1$. Using first principles of solid-angle integration on the sphere and the normalization of $p(\\mu)$, derive the exact expression for the fraction $F(g)$ of scattered photons into the forward hemisphere, defined by $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ (equivalently $0 \\leq \\mu \\leq 1$). Then, evaluate $F(g)$ numerically for $g = 0.75$ and round your final numerical answer to four significant figures, expressed as a unitless decimal fraction. Briefly discuss, at the level of radiative transfer reasoning, how an increase in $F(g)$ influences the direct and diffuse components of downwelling surface irradiance in the single-scattering, optically thin limit.",
            "solution": "The fraction of photons scattered into the forward hemisphere, $F(g)$, is obtained by integrating the phase function $p(\\mu)$ over the solid angle corresponding to the forward hemisphere. The element of solid angle, $\\mathrm{d}\\Omega$, in spherical coordinates is given by $\\mathrm{d}\\Omega = \\sin(\\theta) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\theta \\, \\mathrm{d}\\phi$, where $\\theta$ is the polar angle (here, the scattering angle) and $\\phi$ is the azimuthal angle.\n\nThe forward hemisphere is defined by $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and $0 \\leq \\phi \\leq 2\\pi$. The integral for $F(g)$ is thus:\n$$\nF(g) = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} p(\\cos(\\theta)) \\sin(\\theta) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\theta \\, \\mathrm{d}\\phi\n$$\nSince the Henyey-Greenstein phase function $p(\\mu)$ depends only on $\\mu = \\cos(\\theta)$ and not on the azimuthal angle $\\phi$, the integration over $\\phi$ yields a factor of $2\\pi$:\n$$\nF(g) = 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} p(\\cos(\\theta)) \\sin(\\theta) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\theta\n$$\nWe perform a change of variables from $\\theta$ to $\\mu = \\cos(\\theta)$. The differential is $\\mathrm{d}\\mu = -\\sin(\\theta) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\theta$. The limits of integration change as follows: when $\\theta = 0$, $\\mu = \\cos(0) = 1$; when $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, $\\mu = \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = 0$. Substituting these into the integral:\n$$\nF(g) = 2\\pi \\int_{1}^{0} p(\\mu) (-\\mathrm{d}\\mu) = 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{1} p(\\mu) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\mu\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $p(\\mu)$:\n$$\nF(g) = 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{1 - g^{2}}{4\\pi \\left(1 + g^{2} - 2 g \\mu\\right)^{3/2}} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\mu\n$$\nThe factor $2\\pi$ cancels, and we can take the constant terms outside the integral:\n$$\nF(g) = \\frac{1 - g^{2}}{2} \\int_{0}^{1} \\left(1 + g^{2} - 2 g \\mu\\right)^{-3/2} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\mu\n$$\nTo evaluate the integral, let $u = 1 + g^{2} - 2 g \\mu$. Then $\\mathrm{d}u = -2g \\, \\mathrm{d}\\mu$, which means $\\mathrm{d}\\mu = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{2g}$. The indefinite integral is:\n$$\n\\int u^{-3/2} \\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{2g}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2g} \\frac{u^{-1/2}}{-1/2} = \\frac{1}{g} u^{-1/2} = \\frac{1}{g\\sqrt{u}}\n$$\nSubstituting back for $u$, the antiderivative is $\\frac{1}{g\\sqrt{1 + g^{2} - 2 g \\mu}}$. We now evaluate the definite integral:\n$$\nF(g) = \\frac{1 - g^{2}}{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{g\\sqrt{1 + g^{2} - 2 g \\mu}} \\right]_{0}^{1}\n$$\nEvaluating the expression at the upper limit ($\\mu=1$) and lower limit ($\\mu=0$):\nAt $\\mu = 1$: $\\frac{1}{g\\sqrt{1 + g^{2} - 2g}} = \\frac{1}{g\\sqrt{(1-g)^2}} = \\frac{1}{g|1-g|}$. Since $g \\in (-1,1)$, $1-g > 0$, so $|1-g| = 1-g$. The term is $\\frac{1}{g(1-g)}$.\nAt $\\mu = 0$: $\\frac{1}{g\\sqrt{1 + g^{2}}}$.\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for $F(g)$:\n$$\nF(g) = \\frac{1 - g^{2}}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{g(1-g)} - \\frac{1}{g\\sqrt{1+g^2}} \\right)\n$$\nWe can simplify this expression. Factoring out $\\frac{1}{g}$ from the parenthesis and using $1 - g^2 = (1-g)(1+g)$:\n$$\nF(g) = \\frac{(1-g)(1+g)}{2g} \\left( \\frac{1}{1-g} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+g^2}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nF(g) = \\frac{1+g}{2g} - \\frac{(1-g)(1+g)}{2g\\sqrt{1+g^2}} = \\frac{1+g}{2g} - \\frac{1-g^2}{2g\\sqrt{1+g^2}}\n$$\nThis is the exact analytical expression for $F(g)$.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression for $g = 0.75$. Let's use the exact fractional form $g = \\frac{3}{4}$:\n- $1+g = 1 + \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{7}{4}$\n- $1-g = 1 - \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n- $2g = 2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{3}{2}$\n- $1-g^2 = 1 - \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = 1 - \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{7}{16}$\n- $1+g^2 = 1 + \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = 1 + \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{25}{16}$\n- $\\sqrt{1+g^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{25}{16}} = \\frac{5}{4}$\nSubstitute these into the derived formula:\n$$\nF\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{7/4}{3/2} - \\frac{7/16}{(3/2)(5/4)}\n$$\n$$\nF\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{7}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) - \\frac{7/16}{15/8} = \\frac{14}{12} - \\left(\\frac{7}{16}\\right)\\left(\\frac{8}{15}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nF\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{7}{6} - \\frac{7}{30} = \\frac{35}{30} - \\frac{7}{30} = \\frac{28}{30} = \\frac{14}{15}\n$$\nThe exact value is $\\frac{14}{15}$. To get the numerical answer, we convert this fraction to a decimal:\n$$\nF(0.75) = \\frac{14}{15} \\approx 0.933333...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $F(0.75) \\approx 0.9333$.\n\nFinally, we discuss the physical implications. Downwelling surface irradiance is the solar power per unit area reaching the Earth's surface. It comprises two components:\n1.  **Direct irradiance ($E_{dir}$)**: Radiation that travels from the sun to the surface without being scattered.\n2.  **Diffuse irradiance ($E_{dif}$)**: Radiation that has been scattered by atmospheric constituents (like aerosols) at least once before reaching the surface.\n\nThe problem specifies the single-scattering, optically thin limit. In this regime ($\\tau \\ll 1$, where $\\tau$ is the aerosol optical depth), we consider only photons that have been scattered at most once.\n- The **direct irradiance** is attenuated by scattering events that remove photons from the direct beam. The amount of attenuation is determined by the total scattering optical depth, which represents the probability of a photon being scattered. The direction of scattering does not affect whether a photon is removed from the direct beam. Therefore, changing the phase function's shape by increasing $F(g)$, while keeping the total optical depth constant, has **no effect on the direct irradiance**. $E_{dir} \\approx E_0 \\exp(-\\tau/\\mu_0)$, where $E_0$ is the extraterrestrial irradiance and $\\mu_0$ is the cosine of the solar zenith angle.\n\n- The **diffuse irradiance** at the surface is composed of photons that are scattered into a downward path. The quantity $F(g)$ is precisely the fraction of scattered photons that are directed into the forward (downward) hemisphere. An increase in $F(g)$ corresponds to a more strongly forward-peaked phase function. This means that for the same number of total scattering events (fixed optical depth), a larger proportion of the scattered photons will be redirected toward the surface. Consequently, an increase in $F(g)$ leads to an **increase in the diffuse component of downwelling surface irradiance**.",
