            "problem": "A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) derived from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) provides cell-centered elevations on a uniform square grid used in hydrologic terrain analysis. Consider a synthetic DEM over a square domain comprising a $3 \\times 3$ set of cells with grid spacing $\\Delta x = 30$ m. Flow directions are to be assigned using the D8 scheme, which is based on the following foundational definitions: the local topographic gradient magnitude toward each of the eight neighbors is approximated as the elevation drop divided by the center-to-center distance, where distances to the four cardinal neighbors are $\\Delta x$ and to the four diagonal neighbors are $\\Delta x \\sqrt{2}$. For each cell, flow is assigned to the single neighbor with the maximum positive gradient magnitude (steepest descent). Flow accumulation is defined as the count of the number of cells draining to a given cell within the finite domain, including the cell itself as a contributor of $1$, with no inflow from outside the $3 \\times 3$ domain.\n\nIndex the grid by $(i,j)$ with $i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$ denoting row from north to south and $j \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$ denoting column from west to east. The elevations $z(i,j)$ in meters are:\n- $(1,1)$: $z=99$,\n- $(1,2)$: $z=98$,\n- $(1,3)$: $z=94$,\n- $(2,1)$: $z=97$,\n- $(2,2)$: $z=100$,\n- $(2,3)$: $z=95$,\n- $(3,1)$: $z=96$,\n- $(3,2)$: $z=96$,\n- $(3,3)$: $z=93$.\n\nFirst, determine the D8 flow directions for all nine cells using only the above foundational definitions. Then determine the baseline flow accumulation at cell $(2,3)$.\n\nNext, assess the sensitivity of the D8 assignment and the flow accumulation to a small perturbation in the elevation of the east neighbor of the central cell. Specifically, increase the elevation at $(2,3)$ by a nonnegative perturbation $\\delta$ so that its perturbed elevation becomes $z(2,3) + \\delta$. Determine the minimal strictly positive perturbation $\\delta_{\\min}$ such that the D8 outflow direction of the central cell $(2,2)$ changes away from its baseline direction in a manner that strictly reduces the flow accumulation at $(2,3)$ by exactly $1$ from its baseline value.\n\nReport only $\\delta_{\\min}$. Express your final answer in meters and round to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of watershed hydrology (D8 flow routing, flow accumulation), it is well-posed with a unique solution discernible from the provided data, and it is objective, using precise definitions and quantitative data. All necessary information is provided, and there are no internal contradictions.\n\nThe D8 flow direction algorithm assigns flow from a central cell to one of its eight neighbors. The governing criterion is the maximum positive topographic gradient, defined as the elevation drop divided by the center-to-center distance. Let $z_c$ be the elevation of the central cell and $z_n$ be the elevation of a neighbor. The gradient $S$ is given by:\n$$S = \\frac{z_c - z_n}{L}$$\nwhere the distance $L$ is the grid spacing $\\Delta x$ for cardinal neighbors (N, S, E, W) and $\\Delta x \\sqrt{2}$ for diagonal neighbors (NE, NW, SE, SW). In this problem, $\\Delta x = 30$ m.\n\nFirst, we determine the baseline flow direction for the central cell $(2,2)$, which has an elevation $z(2,2) = 100$ m. We calculate the gradient to all eight neighbors. The elevation data is: $z(1,1)=99$, $z(1,2)=98$, $z(1,3)=94$, $z(2,1)=97$, $z(2,3)=95$, $z(3,1)=96$, $z(3,2)=96$, $z(3,3)=93$.\n\nThe gradients $S_{2,2 \\to i,j}$ from cell $(2,2)$ to its neighbors $(i,j)$ are:\n- To $(1,1)$: $S_{2,2 \\to 1,1} = \\frac{100 - 99}{\\Delta x \\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta x \\sqrt{2}}$\n- To $(1,2)$: $S_{2,2 \\to 1,2} = \\frac{100 - 98}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{2}{\\Delta x}$\n- To $(1,3)$: $S_{2,2 \\to 1,3} = \\frac{100 - 94}{\\Delta x \\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{6}{\\Delta x \\sqrt{2}}$\n- To $(2,1)$: $S_{2,2 \\to 2,1} = \\frac{100 - 97}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{3}{\\Delta x}$\n- To $(2,3)$: $S_{2,2 \\to 2,3} = \\frac{100 - 95}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{5}{\\Delta x}$\n- To $(3,1)$: $S_{2,2 \\to 3,1} = \\frac{100 - 96}{\\Delta x \\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{4}{\\Delta x \\sqrt{2}}$\n- To $(3,2)$: $S_{2,2 \\to 3,2} = \\frac{100 - 96}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{4}{\\Delta x}$\n- To $(3,3)$: $S_{2,2 \\to 3,3} = \\frac{100 - 93}{\\Delta x \\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{7}{\\Delta x \\sqrt{2}}$\n\nTo compare these gradients, we can compare the values of $(\\text{drop}) / (\\text{distance}/\\Delta x)$. The values to compare are $1/\\sqrt{2}$, $2$, $6/\\sqrt{2}$, $3$, $5$, $4/\\sqrt{2}$, $4$, and $7/\\sqrt{2}$.\nNumerically, these are approximately $0.707$, $2$, $4.243$, $3$, $5$, $2.828$, $4$, and $4.950$.\nThe maximum value is $5$, which corresponds to the gradient towards cell $(2,3)$. Therefore, the baseline flow direction from cell $(2,2)$ is to cell $(2,3)$.\n\nThe baseline flow accumulation at cell $(2,3)$ is the number of cells draining to it, including itself. Based on a full analysis of the grid (omitted here for brevity, but verified), only cell $(2,2)$ flows into $(2,3)$. Thus, the contributing cells are $(2,2)$ and $(2,3)$ itself. The baseline flow accumulation at $(2,3)$ is $1+1=2$.\n\nNext, we analyze the perturbation. The elevation of cell $(2,3)$ is increased by a non-negative amount $\\delta$, so its new elevation is $z'(2,3) = 95 + \\delta$. This change only affects the gradient from $(2,2)$ to $(2,3)$. The new gradient, $S'_{2,2 \\to 2,3}$, is:\n$$S'_{2,2 \\to 2,3} = \\frac{100 - (95 + \\delta)}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{5 - \\delta}{\\Delta x}$$\nThe problem requires finding the minimal strictly positive $\\delta_{\\min}$ that changes the flow direction of $(2,2)$ such that the flow accumulation at $(2,3)$ is reduced by exactly $1$. This occurs if cell $(2,2)$ no longer flows to $(2,3)$. For the flow direction to change, the gradient $S'_{2,2 \\to 2,3}$ must cease to be the maximum gradient. The new flow direction will be towards the neighbor with the second-highest original gradient.\n\nThe second-highest gradient from the baseline calculation was $S_{2,2 \\to 3,3} = \\frac{7}{\\Delta x \\sqrt{2}}$ (corresponding to a score of $4.950$, which is the maximum of the remaining scores). The flow direction from $(2,2)$ will switch from $(2,3)$ to $(3,3)$ when the gradient to $(2,3)$ becomes smaller than the gradient to $(3,3)$. The threshold for this change occurs when the two gradients are equal. The minimal perturbation $\\delta_{\\min}$ corresponds to this equality condition:\n$$S'_{2,2 \\to 2,3} = S_{2,2 \\to 3,3}$$\n$$\\frac{5 - \\delta_{\\min}}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{7}{\\Delta x \\sqrt{2}}$$\nWe can cancel $\\Delta x$ from both sides:\n$$5 - \\delta_{\\min} = \\frac{7}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\nSolving for $\\delta_{\\min}$:\n$$\\delta_{\\min} = 5 - \\frac{7}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\nThis value of $\\delta_{\\min}$ is strictly positive because $5 > 7/\\sqrt{2}$ (since $5\\sqrt{2} \\approx 7.07 > 7$). At this threshold, the flow from $(2,2)$ is diverted to $(3,3)$. This reduces the number of cells draining into $(2,3)$ by one, and a check confirms no other cells are rerouted into $(2,3)$. Therefore, the flow accumulation at $(2,3)$ is strictly reduced from $2$ to $1$, a change of exactly $1$, satisfying the problem's conditions.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $\\delta_{\\min}$ and round to four significant figures.\n$$\\delta_{\\min} = 5 - \\frac{7}{\\sqrt{2}} = 5 - \\frac{7\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\approx 5 - \\frac{7 \\times 1.41421356}{2} \\approx 5 - 4.94974746 = 0.05025254$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.05025$.",

The watershed boundary is represented in a Geographic Information System (GIS) as a geographic Coordinate Reference System (CRS) in latitude–longitude. The analyst considers two approaches: (i) performing the area calculation in a geographic CRS by converting degrees to meters using a constant equatorial length per degree for both latitude and longitude, and (ii) reprojecting to an equal-area projection that preserves area. Explain, from first principles, how CRS choice affects area and length computations on the sphere, and then quantify the error introduced by using the geographic CRS approach described in (i) instead of the equal-area approach in (ii).\n\nAssume a spherical Earth of radius $R = 6.371 \\times 10^{6}$ meters. The watershed can be approximated locally by a latitude–longitude rectangle centered at latitude $\\phi_{0} = 45^{\\circ}$, with latitude span $\\Delta \\phi = 0.10^{\\circ}$ and longitude span $\\Delta \\lambda = 0.20^{\\circ}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of geodesy and spherical geometry, well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient data, and objective in its formulation. We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in the fundamental challenge of cartography: representing the curved surface of the Earth on a flat plane. A Coordinate Reference System (CRS) provides the framework for this representation. A geographic CRS, using latitude ($\\phi$) and longitude ($\\lambda$), specifies locations on a spherical or ellipsoidal model in angular units. A projected CRS transforms these angular coordinates onto a two-dimensional Cartesian grid, a process that inevitably introduces distortions in one or more geometric properties: area, shape, distance, or direction. An equal-area projection, mentioned as approach (ii), is specifically designed to preserve area measures, making it the standard for applications like watershed area calculation.\n\nThe analyst's first approach (i) commits a common but significant error: it treats the geographic coordinates (degrees of latitude and longitude) as if they were a uniform grid on a flat plane. We will quantify this error from first principles.\n\nLet us model the Earth as a perfect sphere of radius $R$. The length of a path on this sphere is determined by the arc length formula.\nThe length of a meridional arc (a line of constant longitude) corresponding to a change in latitude of $\\Delta\\phi$ (in radians) is given by:\n$$L_{\\text{meridian}} = R \\cdot \\Delta\\phi$$\nThis length is independent of the position on the sphere.\n\nThe length of a parallel arc (a line of constant latitude, $\\phi$) corresponding to a change in longitude of $\\Delta\\lambda$ (in radians) depends on the latitude. The radius of the circle of parallel at latitude $\\phi$ is $R \\cos(\\phi)$. Therefore, the arc length is:\n$$L_{\\text{parallel}} = (R \\cos(\\phi)) \\cdot \\Delta\\lambda$$\nThis dependence on $\\cos(\\phi)$ is the crucial factor. The length of a degree of longitude is largest at the equator ($\\phi=0$, where $\\cos(\\phi)=1$) and shrinks to zero at the poles ($\\phi = \\pm 90^{\\circ}$, where $\\cos(\\phi)=0$).\n\nWith these principles, we can derive the true area of the specified rectangle and the area computed by the naive method.\n\n**1. True Area Calculation ($A_{\\text{true}}$)**\n\nThe true area of a region on the surface of the sphere is found by integrating the differential surface area element, $dS$, over that region. In spherical coordinates (latitude $\\phi$, longitude $\\lambda$), the surface element is given by:\n$$dS = R^2 \\cos(\\phi) \\, d\\phi \\, d\\lambda$$\nThe watershed is approximated by a rectangle bounded by latitudes $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$ and longitudes $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$.\nGiven a center latitude $\\phi_0 = 45^{\\circ}$ and a latitude span $\\Delta\\phi = 0.10^{\\circ}$, the bounding latitudes are:\n$$\\phi_1 = \\phi_0 - \\frac{\\Delta\\phi}{2} = 45^{\\circ} - 0.05^{\\circ} = 44.95^{\\circ}$$\n$$\\phi_2 = \\phi_0 + \\frac{\\Delta\\phi}{2} = 45^{\\circ} + 0.05^{\\circ} = 45.05^{\\circ}$$\nThe longitude span is given as $\\Delta\\lambda = 0.20^{\\circ}$.\n\nTo calculate the area, we integrate $dS$ over these limits. All angles must be converted to radians for calculation by multiplying by the factor $\\frac{\\pi}{180}$. Let $\\Delta\\lambda_{\\text{rad}}$ be the longitude span in radians.\n$$A_{\\text{true}} = \\int_{\\lambda_1}^{\\lambda_2} \\int_{\\phi_1}^{\\phi_2} R^2 \\cos(\\phi) \\, d\\phi \\, d\\lambda$$\nThe integral is separable:\n$$A_{\\text{true}} = R^2 \\left( \\int_{\\lambda_1}^{\\lambda_2} d\\lambda \\right) \\left( \\int_{\\phi_1}^{\\phi_2} \\cos(\\phi) \\, d\\phi \\right)$$\nEvaluating the integrals, where angles $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$ are in radians:\n$$A_{\\text{true}} = R^2 (\\lambda_2 - \\lambda_1) [\\sin(\\phi)]_{\\phi_1}^{\\phi_2}$$\n$$A_{\\text{true}} = R^2 (\\Delta\\lambda_{\\text{rad}}) [\\sin(\\phi_2) - \\sin(\\phi_1)]$$\n\n**2. Naive Area Calculation ($A_{\\text{naive}}$)**\n\nThe analyst's naive approach uses a constant length conversion for both latitude and longitude, based on the equatorial circumference:\n$$L_{\\text{per degree}} = \\frac{2\\pi R}{360^{\\circ}} = \\frac{\\pi R}{180^{\\circ}}$$\nThe \"height\" of the rectangle is calculated from the latitude span $\\Delta\\phi$ (in degrees):\n$$H_{\\text{naive}} = \\Delta\\phi \\cdot \\frac{\\pi R}{180} = R \\cdot \\left(\\Delta\\phi \\frac{\\pi}{180}\\right) = R \\cdot \\Delta\\phi_{\\text{rad}}$$\nThe \"width\" is calculated from the longitude span $\\Delta\\lambda$ (in degrees):\n$$W_{\\text{naive}} = \\Delta\\lambda \\cdot \\frac{\\pi R}{180} = R \\cdot \\left(\\Delta\\lambda \\frac{\\pi}{180}\\right) = R \\cdot \\Delta\\lambda_{\\text{rad}}$$\nThe naive area is the product of this width and height:\n$$A_{\\text{naive}} = W_{\\text{naive}} \\cdot H_{\\text{naive}} = (R \\cdot \\Delta\\lambda_{\\text{rad}}) (R \\cdot \\Delta\\phi_{\\text{rad}}) = R^2 \\Delta\\lambda_{\\text{rad}} \\Delta\\phi_{\\text{rad}}$$\nThis calculation effectively assumes the Earth is a cylinder projected from the sphere, where the length of a degree of longitude is constant everywhere, equal to its length at the equator.\n\n**3. Relative Error Calculation**\n\nThe relative error is defined as $\\frac{A_{\\text{naive}} - A_{\\text{true}}}{A_{\\text{true}}} = \\frac{A_{\\text{naive}}}{A_{\\text{true}}} - 1$.\nSubstituting the expressions derived above:\n$$\\frac{A_{\\text{naive}}}{A_{\\text{true}}} = \\frac{R^2 \\Delta\\lambda_{\\text{rad}} \\Delta\\phi_{\\text{rad}}}{R^2 \\Delta\\lambda_{\\text{rad}} [\\sin(\\phi_2) - \\sin(\\phi_1)]} = \\frac{\\Delta\\phi_{\\text{rad}}}{\\sin(\\phi_2) - \\sin(\\phi_1)}$$\nWe use the trigonometric identity $\\sin(A) - \\sin(B) = 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{A+B}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{A-B}{2}\\right)$.\nHere, $A = \\phi_2$ and $B = \\phi_1$.\n$$\\frac{A+B}{2} = \\frac{\\phi_2+\\phi_1}{2} = \\phi_0$$\n$$\\frac{A-B}{2} = \\frac{\\phi_2-\\phi_1}{2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\phi}{2}$$\nSubstituting this into the ratio, with all angles in radians:\n$$\\frac{A_{\\text{naive}}}{A_{\\text{true}}} = \\frac{\\Delta\\phi_{\\text{rad}}}{2\\cos(\\phi_{0,\\text{rad}}) \\sin(\\frac{\\Delta\\phi_{\\text{rad}}}{2})}$$\nThe relative error $E_r$ is:\n$$E_r = \\frac{\\Delta\\phi_{\\text{rad}}}{2\\cos(\\phi_{0,\\text{rad}}) \\sin(\\frac{\\Delta\\phi_{\\text{rad}}}{2})} - 1$$\nNow we substitute the given values:\n$\\phi_0 = 45^{\\circ}$, so $\\phi_{0,\\text{rad}} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$. Thus, $\\cos(\\phi_{0,\\text{rad}}) = \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\n$\\Delta\\phi = 0.10^{\\circ}$, so $\\Delta\\phi_{\\text{rad}} = 0.10 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{180} = \\frac{\\pi}{1800}$.\nThen $\\frac{\\Delta\\phi_{\\text{rad}}}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{3600}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the error expression:\n$$E_r = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{1800}}{2\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3600}\\right)} - 1 = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{1800}}{\\sqrt{2}\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3600}\\right)} - 1$$\nFor a small angle $x$, $\\sin(x) \\approx x$.

The error would be $\\sqrt{2}-1 \\approx 0.4142$. This provides a good estimate and conceptual check: the naive width is overestimated by a factor of $1/\\cos(\\phi_0) = 1/\\cos(45^\\circ) = \\sqrt{2}$.\nFor a more precise calculation, we compute the value directly:\n$$E_r = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{1800}}{\\sqrt{2}\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3600}\\right)} - 1$$\n$$E_r \\approx \\frac{0.00174532925}{\\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sin(0.0008726646...)} - 1$$\n$$E_r \\approx \\frac{0.00174532925}{\\sqrt{2} \\cdot 0.00087266451} - 1$$\n$$E_r \\approx \\frac{0.00174532925}{0.00123409641} - 1$$\n$$E_r \\approx 1.41421367 - 1 = 0.41421367$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the relative error is $0.4142$.

For a discrete-time hydrograph, this is approximated by the sum of the products of each ordinate and the time step:\n$$V_{runoff} = \\sum_{j} u_j \\Delta t$$\nSubstituting $u_j = C \\cdot U_j$:\n$$V_{runoff} = \\sum_{j} (C \\cdot U_j) \\Delta t = C \\cdot \\Delta t \\sum_{j} U_j$$\nBy conservation of volume, $V_{runoff} = V_{rain}$:\n$$C \\cdot \\Delta t \\sum_{j} U_j = V_{rain}$$\nThe scaling factor $C$ can thus be calculated as:\n$$C = \\frac{V_{rain}}{\\Delta t \\sum_{j} U_j}$$\nThe DUH ordinates are given as:\n$\\{U_j\\} = [0.00,\\,0.08,\\,0.20,\\,0.40,\\,1.00,\\,0.90,\\,0.75,\\,0.55,\\,0.35,\\,0.22,\\,0.12,\\,0.05,\\,0.00]$.\nThe sum of these ordinates is:\n$$\\sum_{j} U_j = 0.00+0.08+0.20+0.40+1.00+0.90+0.75+0.55+0.35+0.22+0.12+0.05+0.00 = 4.62$$\nNow, we can calculate the scaling factor $C$:\n$$C = \\frac{5 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{m}^3}{(900\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\times 4.62} = \\frac{50000}{4158}\\,\\mathrm{m}^3\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\approx 12.025\\,\\mathrm{m}^3\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nSince the maximum value of the DUH is $U_{peak} = 1.00$, the scaling factor $C$ is also the peak discharge of the unit hydrograph, $u_{peak}$. The ordinates of the $\\Delta t$-duration unit hydrograph, $\\{u_j\\}$, are obtained by multiplying the DUH ordinates $\\{U_j\\}$ by this factor $C$.\n\n**Step 2: Convolution to Compute the Direct Runoff Hydrograph (DRH)**\n\nThe DRH is the result of the convolution of the effective rainfall hyetograph (ERH), $\\{r_k\\}$, and the unit hydrograph, $\\{u_j\\}$. The ERH is given as a sequence of depths in $\\mathrm{mm}$ per $\\Delta t$:\n$\\{r_k\\}_{k=1}^8 = [0,\\,2,\\,6,\\,12,\\,8,\\,3,\\,1,\\,0]$.\nThe ordinates of the DRH, $\\{Q_n\\}$, are computed using the discrete convolution sum, often expressed in hydrology as the method of superposition. For each time step $n$, the discharge $Q_n$ is the sum of the responses to all preceding rainfall pulses:\n$$Q_n = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} r_k u_{n-k+1}$$\nwhere we define $r_k=0$ for $k8$ and $u_j=0$ for $j$ outside the range of the UH definition (here, $j1$ or $j13$). Since $u_j = C \\cdot U_j$, we can write:\n$$Q_n = C \\sum_{k=1}^{n} r_k U_{n-k+1} = C \\cdot Q'_n$$\nwhere $Q'_n$ represents the \"dimensionless\" discharge, which we calculate first. We will index both the rainfall sequence $\\{r_k\\}$ and the DUH sequence $\\{U_j\\}$ starting from $k=1$ and $j=1$ respectively.\n\nThe calculation of the dimensionless discharge ordinates $Q'_n$ proceeds as follows:\n$Q'_1 = r_1 U_1 = 0 \\cdot 0.00 = 0$\n$Q'_2 = r_1 U_2 + r_2 U_1 = 0 \\cdot 0.08 + 2 \\cdot 0.00 = 0$\n$Q'_3 = r_1 U_3 + r_2 U_2 + r_3 U_1 = 0 + 2(0.08) + 0 = 0.16$\n$Q'_4 = r_2 U_3 + r_3 U_2 = 2(0.20) + 6(0.08) = 0.40+0.48 = 0.88$\n$Q'_5 = r_2 U_4 + r_3 U_3 + r_4 U_2 = 2(0.40) + 6(0.20) + 12(0.08) = 0.8+1.2+0.96 = 2.96$\n$Q'_6 = r_2 U_5 + r_3 U_4 + r_4 U_3 + r_5 U_2 = 2(1.00) + 6(0.40) + 12(0.20) + 8(0.08) = 2.0+2.4+2.4+0.64 = 7.44$\n$Q'_7 = r_2 U_6 + r_3 U_5 + r_4 U_4 + r_5 U_3 + r_6 U_2 = 2(0.90) + 6(1.00) + 12(0.40) + 8(0.20) + 3(0.08) = 1.8+6.0+4.8+1.6+0.24 = 14.44$\n$Q'_8 = r_2 U_7 + r_3 U_6 + r_4 U_5 + r_5 U_4 + r_6 U_3 + r_7 U_2 = 2(0.75) + 6(0.90) + 12(1.00) + 8(0.40) + 3(0.20) + 1(0.08) = 1.5+5.4+12.0+3.2+0.6+0.08 = 22.78$\n$Q'_9 = r_2 U_8 + r_3 U_7 + r_4 U_6 + r_5 U_5 + r_6 U_4 + r_7 U_3 = 2(0.55) + 6(0.75) + 12(0.90) + 8(1.00) + 3(0.40) + 1(0.20) = 1.1+4.5+10.8+8.0+1.2+0.2 = 25.8$\n$Q'_{10} = r_2 U_9 + r_3 U_8 + r_4 U_7 + r_5 U_6 + r_6 U_5 + r_7 U_4 = 2(0.35) + 6(0.55) + 12(0.75) + 8(0.90) + 3(1.00) + 1(0.40) = 0.7+3.3+9.0+7.2+3.0+0.4 = 23.6$\n\nThe calculation continues for subsequent time steps, but we can see the values are decreasing after $n=9$.\n\n**Step 3: Identification of the Peak Discharge**\n\nBy inspecting the sequence of computed dimensionless ordinates $\\{Q'_n\\}$, the maximum value is found at time step $n=9$:\n$$Q'_{peak} = Q'_9 = 25.8$$\nThe corresponding peak discharge of the DRH, $Q_{peak}$, is this dimensionless peak multiplied by the scaling factor $C$.\n$$Q_{peak} = C \\cdot Q'_{peak} = \\left(\\frac{50000}{4158}\\,\\mathrm{m}^3\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\right) \\times 25.8$$\n$$Q_{peak} = \\frac{1290000}{4158}\\,\\mathrm{m}^3\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\approx 310.24531\\,\\mathrm{m}^3\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nThe problem asks for the magnitude of the peak discharge rounded to four significant figures.\n$$Q_{peak} \\approx 310.2\\,\\mathrm{m}^3\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nThis peak occurs at time $t = 9 \\times \\Delta t = 9 \\times 15\\,\\mathrm{min} = 135\\,\\mathrm{min}$, or $2.25\\,\\mathrm{h}$ from the start of the storm event.",
