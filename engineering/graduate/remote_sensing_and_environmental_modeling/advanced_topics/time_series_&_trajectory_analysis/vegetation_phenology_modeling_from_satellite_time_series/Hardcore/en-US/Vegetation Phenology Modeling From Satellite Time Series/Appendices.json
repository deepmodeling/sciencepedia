A complete solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\nThe solution is derived in three parts as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Derive the time $t_{\\max}$ of maximum greenup rate.**\n\nThe greenup rate is given by $f'(t)$. The time of maximum greenup rate, $t_{\\max}$, is the time $t$ at which $f'(t)$ is maximized. To find this maximum, we must find the second derivative, $f''(t)$, and set it to zero to identify critical points.\n\nThe first derivative is:\n$$\nf'(t) = \\frac{a k \\exp(-k(t-t_0))}{(1+\\exp(-k(t-t_0)))^2}\n$$\nTo simplify differentiation, let $u(t) = \\exp(-k(t-t_0))$. The derivative of $u(t)$ with respect to $t$ is $u'(t) = -k \\exp(-k(t-t_0)) = -k u(t)$.\nThen, $f'(t)$ can be written as:\n$$\nf'(t) = a k \\frac{u(t)}{(1+u(t))^2}\n$$\nUsing the quotient rule for differentiation, $\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{g(t)}{h(t)}\\right) = \\frac{g'(t)h(t) - g(t)h'(t)}{[h(t)]^2}$, we find $f''(t)$.\nLet $g(t) = u(t)$ and $h(t) = (1+u(t))^2$. Then $g'(t) = u'(t)$ and $h'(t) = 2(1+u(t))u'(t)$.\n$$\nf''(t) = a k \\frac{u'(t)(1+u(t))^2 - u(t)[2(1+u(t))u'(t)]}{(1+u(t))^4}\n$$\nFactor out the common term $u'(t)(1+u(t))$ from the numerator:\n$$\nf''(t) = a k \\frac{u'(t)(1+u(t))[(1+u(t)) - 2u(t)]}{(1+u(t))^4}\n$$\n$$\nf''(t) = a k \\frac{u'(t)(1-u(t))}{(1+u(t))^3}\n$$\nSubstitute back $u(t) = \\exp(-k(t-t_0))$ and $u'(t) = -k \\exp(-k(t-t_0))$:\n$$\nf''(t) = a k \\frac{-k \\exp(-k(t-t_0))(1-\\exp(-k(t-t_0)))}{(1+\\exp(-k(t-t_0)))^3}\n$$\n$$\nf''(t) = -a k^2 \\frac{\\exp(-k(t-t_0))(1-\\exp(-k(t-t_0)))}{(1+\\exp(-k(t-t_0)))^3}\n$$\nTo find the maximum of $f'(t)$, we set $f''(t) = 0$. Since $a  0$, $k  0$, and the exponential term is always positive, the numerator is zero if and only if:\n$$\n1 - \\exp(-k(t-t_0)) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\exp(-k(t-t_0)) = 1\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n-k(t-t_0) = \\ln(1) = 0\n$$\nSince $k0$, we must have:\n$$\nt-t_0 = 0 \\implies t = t_0\n$$\nThus, the time of maximum greenup rate is $t_{\\max} = t_0$.

We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for three computations based on a given set of parameters for a vegetation index time series. We will address each in turn.\n\nFirst, let us list the provided parameters using standard mathematical notation:\n- Yearly minimum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): $NDVI_{\\mathrm{min}} = 0.20$\n- Yearly maximum NDVI: $NDVI_{\\mathrm{max}} = 0.70$\n- Multi-year minimum baseline: $B_{\\mathrm{m}} = 0.20$\n- Winter NDVI baseline: $B_{\\mathrm{w}} = 0.25$\n- Fractional threshold parameter: $p = 0.20$\n- Start of Season (SOS) with baseline $B_{\\mathrm{m}}$: $SOS_{\\mathrm{m}} = 100$ days\n- End of Season (EOS) with baseline $B_{\\mathrm{m}}$: $EOS_{\\mathrm{m}} = 300$ days\n- Local slope at $SOS_{\\mathrm{m}}$ (green-up): $s_{\\mathrm{g}} = 0.010 \\text{ day}^{-1}$\n- Local slope at $EOS_{\\mathrm{m}}$ (senescence): $s_{\\mathrm{s}} = -0.006 \\text{ day}^{-1}$\n\nThe problem requires us to work from first principles. The core principle for defining transition dates is the fractional-threshold method. The NDVI threshold, $T$, is calculated as a function of the baseline, $B$, and the fractional parameter, $p$, as:\n$$T(B) = B + p (NDVI_{\\mathrm{max}} - B) = B(1-p) + p \\cdot NDVI_{\\mathrm{max}}$$\n\n**Task 1: Compute the yearly NDVI amplitude.**\nThe yearly NDVI amplitude, denoted by $A$, is defined as the difference between the yearly maximum and minimum NDVI values.\n$$A = NDVI_{\\mathrm{max}} - NDVI_{\\mathrm{min}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$A = 0.70 - 0.20 = 0.50$$\n\n**Task 2: Compute the original Length of Season (LOS) under baseline $B_{\\mathrm{m}}$.**\nThe Length of Season, denoted by $LOS$, is defined as the difference between the End of Season and Start of Season dates.

A phenological transition date $t$ is defined by the condition $NDVI(t) = T$. A small change in the threshold $\\Delta T$ will lead to a small change in the transition date $\\Delta t$. The relationship is given by the definition of the derivative (local slope $s$):\n$$s = \\frac{d(NDVI)}{dt} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta NDVI}{\\Delta t}$$\nHere, the change in the NDVI level is the change in the threshold, so $\\Delta NDVI = \\Delta T$.\n$$\\Delta T \\approx s \\cdot \\Delta t$$\nRearranging for the change in time gives the linearization formula:\n$$\\Delta t \\approx \\frac{\\Delta T}{s}$$\n\nWe apply this formula to find the shifts in SOS and EOS.\nThe shift in SOS, $\\Delta SOS$, is calculated using the green-up slope $s_{\\mathrm{g}}$:\n$$\\Delta SOS = SOS_{\\mathrm{w}} - SOS_{\\mathrm{m}} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta T}{s_{\\mathrm{g}}}$$\nThe shift in EOS, $\\Delta EOS$, is calculated using the senescence slope $s_{\\mathrm{s}}$:\n$$\\Delta EOS = EOS_{\\mathrm{w}} - EOS_{\\mathrm{m}} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta T}{s_{\\mathrm{s}}}$$\n\nThe change in the Length of Season, $\\Delta LOS$, is defined as:\n$$\\Delta LOS = LOS_{\\mathrm{w}} - LOS_{\\mathrm{m}}$$\nwhere $LOS_{\\mathrm{w}} = EOS_{\\mathrm{w}} - SOS_{\\mathrm{w}}$.
