This practice demonstrates how to propagate uncertainties from independent measurement sources—in this case, the ellipsoidal height $h$ from a GNSS measurement and the geoid undulation $N$ from a model—to determine the final uncertainty $\\sigma_{H}$ of the orthometric height $H$. Mastering this fundamental skill allows you to rigorously quantify the vertical accuracy of your ground control and understand the composite effect of different error sources .",

            "solution": "The objective is to compute the uncertainty of the orthometric height and then the half-width of a two-sided confidence interval at confidence level $0.95$. The orthometric height is defined by the geometric relation\n$$\nH = h - N,\n$$\nwhere $h$ is the ellipsoidal height and $N$ is the geoid undulation.\n\nWe model $h$ and $N$ as random variables with means given by the reported values and with standard uncertainties $\\sigma_{h}$ and $\\sigma_{N}$, respectively, representing the standard deviations of their Gaussian error distributions. The orthometric height $H$ is then a linear combination of these random variables. For any linear combination of random variables, the variance is governed by the well-tested rule\n$$\n\\operatorname{var}(aX + bY) = a^{2}\\operatorname{var}(X) + b^{2}\\operatorname{var}(Y) + 2ab\\,\\operatorname{cov}(X,Y),\n$$\nwhich follows from the definition of variance and covariance and the bilinearity of covariance.

Consider a frame recorded at GPS time $t_{\\mathrm{GPS}} = 2014$ July $1$ at $00:00:00$. The task is to convert this GPS time to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and to quantify the georeferencing displacement induced by a separate timing error in the sensor’s clock. Begin from the following fundamental base: Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is maintained close to mean solar time by occasional insertion of leap seconds, International Atomic Time (TAI) is a continuous atomic timescale, and Global Positioning System (GPS) time is a continuous atomic timescale defined to be $19$ seconds behind TAI at its epoch so that GPS time and UTC were aligned at the GPS epoch. Use the well-established fact that each leap second insertion after the GPS epoch causes UTC to lag GPS time by an additional $1$ second. The GPS epoch was $1980$ January $6$. The set of leap seconds inserted after the GPS epoch and before $2017$ consists of the following UTC dates (each leap second is inserted at the end of the listed day): $1981$ June $30$, $1982$ June $30$, $1983$ June $30$, $1985$ June $30$, $1987$ December $31$, $1989$ December $31$, $1990$ December $31$, $1992$ June $30$, $1993$ June $30$, $1994$ June $30$, $1995$ December $31$, $1997$ June $30$, $1998$ December $31$, $2005$ December $31$, $2008$ December $31$, $2012$ June $30$, $2015$ June $30$, $2016$ December $31$.

The second is to quantify a georeferencing displacement resulting from a timing error.\n\nFirst, we address the determination of the GPS-UTC offset, denoted as $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{GPS-UTC}}$.\nThe problem states that at the GPS epoch, which was $1980$ January $6$, GPS time ($T_{\\mathrm{GPS}}$) and UTC ($T_{\\mathrm{UTC}}$) were aligned.

Each leap second insertion causes UTC to lag GPS time by an additional $1$ second. Consequently, the total offset $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{GPS-UTC}} = T_{\\mathrm{GPS}} - T_{\\mathrm{UTC}}$ at any given time is equal to the total number of leap seconds that have been inserted between the GPS epoch and that time.\n\nThe task is to find this offset for the specific GPS time $t_{\\mathrm{GPS}} = 2014$ July $1$ at $00:00:00$.

Therefore, by the time of the imaging frame, a total of $16$ leap seconds had been introduced.\nEach leap second contributes $1$ second to the total offset. Thus, the total offset is:\n$$ \\Delta_{\\mathrm{GPS-UTC}} = 16 \\, \\mathrm{s} $$\n\nSecond, we address the quantification of the along-track georeferencing displacement.\nThis task is stated to be independent of the first. We are asked to find the magnitude of the displacement, let's call it $d$, caused by a sensor timing error. The problem provides the necessary parameters:\n- The timing error, $\\Delta t = 1 \\, \\mathrm{s}$.\n- The aircraft's constant ground speed, $v$, given in units of $\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$.\n- The model for displacement, which is the product of speed and time error.\n\nThe physical relationship between distance, speed, and time is:\n$$ d = v \\times \\Delta t $$\nSubstituting the given values into this equation:\n$$ d = v \\, (\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}) \\times 1 \\, (\\mathrm{s}) $$\nThe units are consistent, yielding a displacement in meters. The magnitude of the displacement is therefore:\n$$ d = v $$\nThe problem requests this quantity as a closed-form expression in terms of $v$. This expression is simply $v$.\n\nThe final answer is to be reported as a two-entry row matrix, with the first entry being the numerical value of $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{GPS-UTC}}$ in seconds, and the second entry being the expression for the displacement in meters.\n- First entry: $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{GPS-UTC}} = 16$.\n- Second entry: $d = v$.",
