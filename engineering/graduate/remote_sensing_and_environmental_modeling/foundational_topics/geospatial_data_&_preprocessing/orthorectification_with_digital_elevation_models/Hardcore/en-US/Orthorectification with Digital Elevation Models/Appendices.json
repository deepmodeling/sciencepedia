            "problem": "An orthorectified image is produced on the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid, North-oriented, using the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) datum. The output raster grid has pixel size $s_{\\text{out}} = 1\\,\\text{m}$ and is referenced by the coordinates of the upper-left pixel corner $(x_{0}^{\\text{out}}, y_{0}^{\\text{out}}) = (450000.0\\,\\text{m},\\,4640000.0\\,\\text{m})$. Pixel indices $(i,j)$ follow the standard image convention: $i$ increases to the right (east) and $j$ increases downward (south). The ground coordinate of a pixel is taken at its center.\n\nA Digital Elevation Model (DEM) on the same UTM grid has square cells of size $s_{\\text{DEM}} = 10\\,\\text{m}$, referenced by the upper-left cell corner coordinates $(x_{0}^{\\text{DEM}}, y_{0}^{\\text{DEM}}) = (449990.0\\,\\text{m},\\,4640010.0\\,\\text{m})$. Elevations are stored at DEM grid nodes located at cell corners. Elevations at the four DEM nodes surrounding the orthorectified pixel center are:\n- $Z_{00}$ at $(i_{\\text{DEM}}, j_{\\text{DEM}})$ equals $348.2\\,\\text{m}$,\n- $Z_{10}$ at $(i_{\\text{DEM}}+1, j_{\\text{DEM}})$ equals $349.0\\,\\text{m}$,\n- $Z_{01}$ at $(i_{\\text{DEM}}, j_{\\text{DEM}}+1)$ equals $347.6\\,\\text{m}$,\n- $Z_{11}$ at $(i_{\\text{DEM}}+1, j_{\\text{DEM}}+1)$ equals $348.5\\,\\text{m}$,\n\nwhere $(i_{\\text{DEM}}, j_{\\text{DEM}})$ are the integer indices of the DEM node just northwest (upper-left) of the pixel center.\n\nStarting from core definitions of raster georeferencing on projected Cartesian coordinates and linear interpolation on grids, derive the expressions that map the orthorectified pixel index $(i,j)$ to its UTM ground coordinates $(x,y)$ at the pixel center and then derive the bilinear interpolation expression to fetch the elevation $Z$ at that center from the DEM using the four surrounding node elevations. For the specific pixel $(i,j) = (1234, 567)$, compute the numerical values of $(x,y)$ and the bilinearly interpolated elevation $Z$. Express all coordinates and elevation in meters. Provide exact values; no rounding is required. The final answer must contain the computed $(x,y)$ and $Z$.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of remote sensing and geomatics, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We will proceed by first deriving the general expressions for calculating the ground coordinates from pixel indices, then deriving the expression for bilinear interpolation of elevation from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and finally applying these expressions to compute the required numerical values.\n\nFirst, we derive the mapping from the orthorectified pixel index $(i,j)$ to its UTM ground coordinates $(x,y)$ at the pixel center. The problem states that the grid is North-oriented. The origin of the output raster is given by the coordinates of the upper-left corner of the pixel $(i,j) = (0,0)$, which are $(x_{0}^{\\text{out}}, y_{0}^{\\text{out}})$. The pixel size is $s_{\\text{out}}$. The index $i$ increases to the right, which corresponds to the Easting (x-coordinate) direction in a North-oriented UTM system. The index $j$ increases downward, which corresponds to the southerly direction, opposite to the Northing (y-coordinate).\n\nThe coordinate of a pixel is taken at its center. For a pixel at index $i$, its center is displaced from the grid origin by $i$ full pixel widths plus half a pixel width. Therefore, the x-coordinate (Easting) $x$ of the center of pixel $(i,j)$ is:\n$$x = x_{0}^{\\text{out}} + i \\cdot s_{\\text{out}} + \\frac{1}{2} s_{\\text{out}} = x_{0}^{\\text{out}} + \\left(i + 0.5\\right) s_{\\text{out}}$$\n\nSimilarly, for a pixel at index $j$, its center is displaced from the grid origin. Since $j$ increases downwards (south), this corresponds to a decrease in the y-coordinate (Northing). The displacement is $j$ full pixel heights plus half a pixel height. Thus, the y-coordinate (Northing) $y$ is:\n$$y = y_{0}^{\\text{out}} - j \\cdot s_{\\text{out}} - \\frac{1}{2} s_{\\text{out}} = y_{0}^{\\text{out}} - \\left(j + 0.5\\right) s_{\\text{out}}$$\n\nWe are given the specific pixel $(i,j) = (1234, 567)$. The other parameters are $(x_{0}^{\\text{out}}, y_{0}^{\\text{out}}) = (450000.0\\,\\text{m}, 4640000.0\\,\\text{m})$ and $s_{\\text{out}} = 1\\,\\text{m}$.\nSubstituting these values:\n$$x = 450000.0 + (1234 + 0.5) \\times 1.0 = 450000.0 + 1234.5 = 451234.5\\,\\text{m}$$\n$$y = 4640000.0 - (567 + 0.5) \\times 1.0 = 4640000.0 - 567.5 = 4639432.5\\,\\text{m}$$\nThe ground coordinates of the center of pixel $(1234, 567)$ are $(x, y) = (451234.5\\,\\text{m}, 4639432.5\\,\\text{m})$.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for bilinear interpolation to find the elevation $Z$ at the point $(x,y)$ using the DEM. The DEM is a grid where elevations are provided at the grid nodes (corners of the cells). To find the elevation at an arbitrary point within a grid cell, we use bilinear interpolation. This involves two successive linear interpolations.\n\nLet the four DEM nodes surrounding the point $(x,y)$ form a rectangle. The problem provides the elevations at these nodes. Let the coordinates of the upper-left (northwest) node be $(x_{\\text{ul}}, y_{\\text{ul}})$ and its elevation be $Z_{\\text{ul}}$. The other nodes are upper-right $(x_{\\text{ur}}, y_{\\text{ur}})$ with elevation $Z_{\\text{ur}}$, lower-left $(x_{\\text{ll}}, y_{\\text{ll}})$ with elevation $Z_{\\text{ll}}$, and lower-right $(x_{\\text{lr}}, y_{\\text{lr}})$ with elevation $Z_{\\text{lr}}$. In the given problem's notation, with DEM cell size $s_{\\text{DEM}}$:\n$Z_{00}$ is at the NW corner $(x_{\\text{ul}}, y_{\\text{ul}})$, which the problem maps to DEM index $(i_{\\text{DEM}}, j_{\\text{DEM}})$.\n$Z_{10}$ is at the NE corner $(x_{\\text{ul}}+s_{\\text{DEM}}, y_{\\text{ul}})$, mapped to $(i_{\\text{DEM}}+1, j_{\\text{DEM}})$.\n$Z_{01}$ is at the SW corner $(x_{\\text{ul}}, y_{\\text{ul}}-s_{\\text{DEM}})$, mapped to $(i_{\\text{DEM}}, j_{\\text{DEM}}+1)$.\n$Z_{11}$ is at the SE corner $(x_{\\text{ul}}+s_{\\text{DEM}}, y_{\\text{ul}}-s_{\\text{DEM}})$, mapped to $(i_{\\text{DEM}}+1, j_{\\text{DEM}}+1)$.\n\nFirst, we define normalized fractional distances of the point $(x,y)$ within the cell, relative to the upper-left corner $(x_{\\textul}}, y_{\\text{ul}})$:\n$$\\Delta x = \\frac{x - x_{\\text{ul}}}{s_{\\text{DEM}}}$$\n$$\\Delta y = \\frac{y_{\\text{ul}} - y}{s_{\\text{DEM}}}$$\nNote that $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta y$ are dimensionless and range from $0$ to $1$.\n\nThe interpolation proceeds in two steps. First, we linearly interpolate along the x-axis at the top and bottom edges of the cell:\nAn intermediate elevation $Z_{\\text{top}}$ along the top edge at the x-coordinate of our point is:\n$$Z_{\\text{top}} = Z_{00}(1 - \\Delta x) + Z_{10} \\Delta x$$\nAn intermediate elevation $Z_{\\text{bottom}}$ along the bottom edge is:\n$$Z_{\\text{bottom}} = Z_{01}(1 - \\Delta x) + Z_{11} \\Delta x$$\n\nSecond, we linearly interpolate along the y-axis between these two intermediate values:\n$$Z = Z_{\\text{top}}(1 - \\Delta y) + Z_{\\text{bottom}} \\Delta y$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $Z_{\\text{top}}$ and $Z_{\\text{bottom}}$ gives the complete bilinear interpolation formula:\n$$Z = \\left(Z_{00}(1 - \\Delta x) + Z_{10} \\Delta x\\right)(1 - \\Delta y) + \\left(Z_{01}(1 - \\Delta x) + Z_{11} \\Delta x\\right) \\Delta y$$\nThis can be expanded to:\n$$Z = Z_{00}(1-\\Delta x)(1-\\Delta y) + Z_{10}\\Delta x(1-\\Delta y) + Z_{01}(1-\\Delta x)\\Delta y + Z_{11}\\Delta x\\Delta y$$\n\nNow we compute the numerical value for $Z$. First, we need to find the coordinates of the upper-left DEM node that contains our point $(x,y)$. The DEM origin is $(x_{0}^{\\text{DEM}}, y_{0}^{\\text{DEM}}) = (449990.0\\,\\text{m}, 4640010.0\\,\\text{m})$ and cell size is $s_{\\text{DEM}}=10\\,\\text{m}$. The indices $(i_{\\text{DEM}}, j_{\\text{DEM}})$ of the upper-left node are:\n$$i_{\\text{DEM}} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x - x_{0}^{\\text{DEM}}}{s_{\\text{DEM}}} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{451234.5 - 449990.0}{10.0} \\right\\rfloor = \\lfloor 124.45 \\rfloor = 124$$\n$$j_{\\text{DEM}} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{y_{0}^{\\text{DEM}} - y}{s_{\\text{DEM}}} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{4640010.0 - 4639432.5}{10.0} \\right\\rfloor = \\lfloor 57.75 \\rfloor = 57$$\nThe coordinates of this node $(124, 57)$ are:\n$$x_{\\text{ul}} = x_{0}^{\\text{DEM}} + i_{\\text{DEM}} \\cdot s_{\\text{DEM}} = 449990.0 + 124 \\times 10.0 = 451230.0\\,\\text{m}$$\n$$y_{\\text{ul}} = y_{0}^{\\text{DEM}} - j_{\\text{DEM}} \\cdot s_{\\text{DEM}} = 4640010.0 - 57 \\times 10.0 = 4639440.0\\,\\text{m}$$\n\nNow we can compute the fractional distances:\n$$\\Delta x = \\frac{451234.5 - 451230.0}{10.0} = \\frac{4.5}{10.0} = 0.45$$\n$$\\Delta y = \\frac{4639440.0 - 4639432.5}{10.0} = \\frac{7.5}{10.0} = 0.75$$\n\nThe given elevations are $Z_{00} = 348.2\\,\\text{m}$, $Z_{10} = 349.0\\,\\text{m}$, $Z_{01} = 347.6\\,\\text{m}$, and $Z_{11} = 348.5\\,\\text{m}$.\nWe compute the intermediate elevations:\n$$Z_{\\text{top}} = (348.2)(1 - 0.45) + (349.0)(0.45) = (348.2)(0.55) + (349.0)(0.45) = 191.51 + 157.05 = 348.56\\,\\text{m}$$\n$$Z_{\\text{bottom}} = (347.6)(1 - 0.45) + (348.5)(0.45) = (347.6)(0.55) + (348.5)(0.45) = 191.18 + 156.825 = 348.005\\,\\text{m}$$\nFinally, we compute the elevation $Z$ at the point:\n$$Z = Z_{\\text{top}}(1 - 0.75) + Z_{\\text{bottom}}(0.75) = (348.56)(0.25) + (348.005)(0.75) = 87.14 + 261.00375 = 348.14375\\,\\text{m}$$\n\nThe computed values for the pixel $(i,j)=(1234, 567)$ are:\nGround coordinates $(x,y) = (451234.5\\,\\text{m}, 4639432.5\\,\\text{m})$.\nBilinearly interpolated elevation $Z = 348.14375\\,\\text{m}$.",

The process begins with a validation of the problem statement, followed by a step-by-step derivation of the solution from first principles.\n\n**Problem Validation**\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Sensor model: Central-perspective pushbroom optical satellite.\n- Required height for sensor model: Ellipsoidal height, $h$, referenced to WGS84.\n- Provided height from DEM: Orthometric height, $H$.\n- Geodetic definitions:\n    - Orthometric height: $H$.\n    - Ellipsoidal height: $h$.\n    - Geoid undulation: $N$ (geoid's height above the ellipsoid).\n- The relationship between heights is implicitly defined by the terms, standard in geodesy, as $h = H + N$.\n- Approximations for the scene:\n    - Moderate terrain, allowing for a local horizontal plane approximation normal to the ellipsoid.\n    - Sensor view geometry is described by a single off-nadir angle.\n- Numerical values for quantification:\n    - Geoid undulation, $N = 30\\,\\text{m}$.\n    - Off-nadir look angle, $\\theta = 25^{\\circ}$.\n- Required output: Magnitude of the horizontal positional bias in meters, rounded to four significant figures.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded (Critical)**: The problem is fundamentally sound. The definitions of orthometric height ($H$), ellipsoidal height ($h$), and geoid undulation ($N$), along with their relationship ($h \\approx H + N$), are cornerstones of geodesy. The concept of relief displacement in a central projection caused by height errors is a classic topic in photogrammetry and remote sensing. The given values for geoid undulation ($N = 30\\,\\text{m}$) and off-nadir angle ($\\theta = 25^{\\circ}$) are realistic for Earth observation scenarios.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed.

The simplifying assumptions (local horizontal plane, single off-nadir angle) are explicitly stated and make the problem solvable with the given information. The solution is unique and stable.\n- **Objective (Critical)**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and technical language, free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains no inconsistencies, missing information, or violations of physical principles. Therefore, a reasoned solution can be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the geometric consequence of a vertical error in a central-perspective imaging system.\n\n1.  **Quantify the Vertical Error**:\n    The relationship between ellipsoidal height ($h$), orthometric height ($H$), and geoid undulation ($N$) is given by:\n    $$h = H + N$$\n    The sensor model requires ellipsoidal height ($h$) as the vertical input. However, it is supplied with orthometric height ($H$). The vertical error, which we denote as $\\Delta z$, is the difference between the provided height and the required height:\n    $$\\Delta z = H - h$$\n    Substituting the expression for $h$, we find:\n    $$\\Delta z = H - (H + N) = -N$$\n    The magnitude of this vertical error is therefore $|\\Delta z| = |-N| = |N|$. The sign indicates that if the geoid undulation $N$ is positive, the provided orthometric height $H$ is lower than the true ellipsoidal height $h$.\n\n2.  **Model the Geometric Displacement**:\n    The problem specifies a central-perspective sensor and a single off-nadir look angle, $\\theta$. This angle is measured between the sensor's line-of-sight to the target and the local vertical (the normal to the ellipsoid). The problem's assumption of a locally horizontal ground plane simplifies the geometry to a 2D trigonometric problem.\n\n    The error in height, $\\Delta z$, causes the ground point to be incorrectly located along the sensor's line-of-sight. This creates a horizontal positional bias on the orthorectified image plane. Let's denote the magnitude of this horizontal bias as $\\Delta p$.\n\n    We can construct a right-angled triangle where:\n    - The **adjacent** side is the magnitude of the vertical error, $|\\Delta z| = |N|$. This side is aligned with the local vertical.\n    - The **opposite** side is the horizontal positional bias, $\\Delta p$. This side is aligned with the local horizontal plane.\n    - The angle between the hypotenuse (the sensor's line-of-sight) and the adjacent side (the local vertical) is the off-nadir angle, $\\theta$.\n\n    From the definition of the tangent function in a right-angled triangle:\n    $$\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{adjacent}} = \\frac{\\Delta p}{|N|}$$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Horizontal Bias**:\n    By rearranging the equation, we can express the magnitude of the horizontal bias, $\\Delta p$, as a function of the geoid undulation and the off-nadir angle:\n    $$\\Delta p = |N| \\tan(\\theta)$$\n    This is the classic formula for relief displacement in photogrammetry.\n\n    Now, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n    - $|N| = |30\\,\\text{m}| = 30\\,\\text{m}$\n    - $\\theta = 25^{\\circ}$\n\n    The calculation is as follows:\n    $$\\Delta p = 30 \\times \\tan(25^{\\circ})$$\n    Using a calculator for the value of $\\tan(25^{\\circ})$:\n    $$\\tan(25^{\\circ}) \\approx 0.466307658$$\n    Therefore, the magnitude of the horizontal bias is:\n    $$\\Delta p \\approx 30 \\times 0.466307658 \\approx 13.98922974\\,\\text{m}$$\n\n4.  **Final Answer Formatting**:\n    The problem asks for the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n    The calculated value is $13.98922974...$. The first four significant figures are $1$, $3$, $9$, and $8$. The fifth significant figure is $9$, so we round up the fourth figure.\n    $$\\Delta p \\approx 13.99\\,\\text{m}$$\n    This is the final numerical answer.",
