            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained, and therefore a solution will be provided.\n\nThe core principle for converting spectral radiance density between different spectral variables, such as wavelength ($\\lambda$) and frequency ($\\nu$), is that the amount of radiance, $dL$, within an infinitesimal spectral interval must be conserved regardless of the variable used to describe that interval. Spectral radiance density is defined as radiance per unit spectral variable. Therefore, we can write the radiance $dL$ in a small band as:\n$$dL = L_{\\lambda} d\\lambda$$\nwhere $L_{\\lambda}$ is the spectral radiance with respect to wavelength. Similarly, expressed in terms of frequency, the radiance is:\n$$dL = L_{\\nu} d\\nu$$\nwhere $L_{\\nu}$ is the spectral radiance with respect to frequency.\n\nSince radiance and spectral radiance densities ($L_{\\lambda}$, $L_{\\nu}$) are non-negative physical quantities, the infinitesimal radiance $dL$ must also be non-negative. This means we must equate the magnitudes of the two expressions:\n$$L_{\\lambda} |d\\lambda| = L_{\\nu} |d\\nu|$$\n\nThe relationship between wavelength and frequency for electromagnetic radiation is given by:\n$$\\nu = \\frac{c}{\\lambda}$$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light. To find the relationship between the differentials $d\\nu$ and $d\\lambda$, we differentiate $\\nu$ with respect to $\\lambda$:\n$$\\frac{d\\nu}{d\\lambda} = \\frac{d}{d\\lambda}\\left(\\frac{c}{\\lambda}\\right) = -c\\lambda^{-2} = -\\frac{c}{\\lambda^2}$$\nThis gives the differential relationship $d\\nu = -\\frac{c}{\\lambda^2}d\\lambda$. The negative sign indicates the inverse relationship between frequency and wavelength: as one increases, the other decreases.\n\nThe term that relates the two densities is the Jacobian of the coordinate transformation. In this one-dimensional case, the Jacobian is the absolute value of the derivative of the transformation. We wish to find $L_{\\nu}$ as a function of $L_{\\lambda}$, so we need the conversion factor $|d\\lambda/d\\nu|$. From the previous derivative, we can write:\n$$\\left|\\frac{d\\lambda}{d\\nu}\\right| = \\left|\\left(\\frac{d\\nu}{d\\lambda}\\right)^{-1}\\right| = \\left|-\\frac{\\lambda^2}{c}\\right| = \\frac{\\lambda^2}{c}$$\nAlternatively, we can express $\\lambda$ in terms of $\\nu$, $\\lambda = c/\\nu$, and differentiate with respect to $\\nu$:\n$$\\frac{d\\lambda}{d\\nu} = \\frac{d}{d\\nu}\\left(\\frac{c}{\\nu}\\right) = -\\frac{c}{\\nu^2}$$\nThe absolute value of this Jacobian is $|d\\lambda/d\\nu| = c/\\nu^2$.\n\nThe change-of-variables rule for density functions states that $L_{\\nu} = L_{\\lambda} |d\\lambda/d\\nu|$. Using the first form of the Jacobian, we have:\n$$L_{\\nu} = L_{\\lambda} \\frac{\\lambda^2}{c}$$\nThis is the required conversion formula. The origin of the Jacobian factor $\\lambda^2/c$ is the derivative that relates the infinitesimal intervals $d\\lambda$ and $d\\nu$. The absolute value is taken to ensure the physical quantity of spectral radiance density remains positive, as dictated by the conservation of radiance $L_{\\lambda} |d\\lambda| = L_{\\nu} |d\\nu|$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value. The given data are:\n$L_{\\lambda} = 2.80\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,sr^{-1}\\,\\mu m^{-1}}$\n$\\lambda = 550\\ \\mathrm{nm}$\n$c = 2.99792458 \\times 10^{8}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$\n\nIt is critical to work in a consistent set of units.

            "solution": "### Derivation of TOA Reflectance\nThe derivation proceeds from the fundamental principles specified in the problem statement.\n\n1.  **Solar Irradiance at Earth's Orbit**: The exoatmospheric solar irradiance, $E_0$, is given at a standard distance of $1$ astronomical unit ($\\mathrm{au}$). The irradiance at any other Earth–Sun distance, $d$, is given by the inverse-square law. Let $E(d)$ be the irradiance at distance $d$.\n    $$E(d) = E_0 \\left(\\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{au}}{d}\\right)^2$$\n    Since the distance $d$ is provided in units of $\\mathrm{au}$, this simplifies to:\n    $$E(d) = \\frac{E_0}{d^2}$$\n\n2.  **Incident Irradiance on the Target**: The solar irradiance incident on a horizontal surface at the top of the atmosphere, $E_{\\text{inc}}$, depends on the solar zenith angle, $\\theta_s$. This is the incoming radiant flux per unit area of the horizontal surface.\n    $$E_{\\text{inc}} = E(d) \\cos(\\theta_s) = \\frac{E_0 \\cos(\\theta_s)}{d^2}$$\n\n3.  **Reflected Exitance and Radiance**: The Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{TOA}}$, is defined as the ratio of the radiant flux reflected from the surface (exitance, $M$) to the incident radiant flux ($E_{\\text{inc}}$).\n    $$\\rho_{\\mathrm{TOA}} = \\frac{M}{E_{\\text{inc}}}$$\n    For an ideal Lambertian surface, the reflected radiance, $L$, is isotropic (uniform in all directions). The total exitance $M$ is related to this radiance by integrating over the hemisphere of reflection, which yields:\n    $$M = \\pi L$$\n\n4.  **Final Expression for TOA Reflectance**: The problem states that atmospheric path radiance is negligible. This implies that the at-sensor radiance $L$ is solely due to the solar radiation reflected by the surface. Therefore, the measured radiance is the surface-reflected radiance. Substituting the expressions for $M$ and $E_{\\text{inc}}$ into the definition of reflectance yields the desired expression.\n    $$\\rho_{\\mathrm{TOA}} = \\frac{\\pi L}{E_{\\text{inc}}} = \\frac{\\pi L}{\\frac{E_0 \\cos(\\theta_s)}{d^2}}$$\n    Rearranging this gives the final expression for TOA reflectance:\n    $$\\rho_{\\mathrm{TOA}} = \\frac{\\pi L d^2}{E_0 \\cos(\\theta_s)}$$\n\n### Numerical Computations\nThe derived formula is now used to compute the required values for acquisitions A and B, rounding each final result to four significant figures.\n\nThe constant parameters are:\n-   $E_{0} = 1500\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$\n-   $\\theta_{s} = 30^{\\circ}$, so $\\cos(\\theta_s) = \\cos(30^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$\n\n**For Acquisition A**:\n-   $L_A = 60\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{sr}^{-1}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$\n-   $d_A = 0.983\\,\\mathrm{au}$\n\nThe TOA reflectance for acquisition A, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{TOA},A}$, is:\n$$\\rho_{\\mathrm{TOA},A} = \\frac{\\pi L_A d_A^2}{E_0 \\cos(\\theta_s)} = \\frac{\\pi (60) (0.983)^2}{1500 \\cos(30^{\\circ})} \\approx \\frac{182.1405}{1299.0381} \\approx 0.140211$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\rho_{\\mathrm{TOA},A} = 0.1402$.\n\n**For Acquisition B**:\n-   $L_B = 58\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{sr}^{-1}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$\n-   $d_B = 1.017\\,\\mathrm{au}$\n\nThe TOA reflectance for acquisition B, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{TOA},B}$, is:\n$$\\rho_{\\mathrm{TOA},B} = \\frac{\\pi L_B d_B^2}{E_0 \\cos(\\theta_s)} = \\frac{\\pi (58) (1.017)^2}{1500 \\cos(30^{\\circ})} \\approx \\frac{188.4616}{1299.0381} \\approx 0.145077$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\rho_{\\mathrm{TOA},B} = 0.1451$.\n\n**Ratio of Reflectances**:\nThe ratio $\\rho_{\\mathrm{TOA},B}/\\rho_{\\mathrm{TOA},A}$ is computed.
