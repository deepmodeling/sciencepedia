This first practice demonstrates the fundamental conversion from at-sensor spectral radiance to Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, a critical step for comparing imagery over time.

The provided physical quantities are realistic for Earth observation in the specified spectral band.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is self-contained and provides all necessary information to derive the requested expression and compute the required values.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be furnished.\n\n### Derivation of TOA Reflectance\nThe derivation proceeds from the fundamental principles specified in the problem statement.\n\n1.  **Solar Irradiance at Earth's Orbit**: The exoatmospheric solar irradiance, $E_0$, is given at a standard distance of $1$ astronomical unit ($\\mathrm{au}$). The irradiance at any other Earth–Sun distance, $d$, is given by the inverse-square law. Let $E(d)$ be the irradiance at distance $d$.\n    $$E(d) = E_0 \\left(\\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{au}}{d}\\right)^2$$\n    Since the distance $d$ is provided in units of $\\mathrm{au}$, this simplifies to:\n    $$E(d) = \\frac{E_0}{d^2}$$\n\n2.  **Incident Irradiance on the Target**: The solar irradiance incident on a horizontal surface at the top of the atmosphere, $E_{\\text{inc}}$, depends on the solar zenith angle, $\\theta_s$. This is the incoming radiant flux per unit area of the horizontal surface.\n    $$E_{\\text{inc}} = E(d) \\cos(\\theta_s) = \\frac{E_0 \\cos(\\theta_s)}{d^2}$$\n\n3.  **Reflected Exitance and Radiance**: The Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{TOA}}$, is defined as the ratio of the radiant flux reflected from the surface (exitance, $M$) to the incident radiant flux ($E_{\\text{inc}}$).\n    $$\\rho_{\\mathrm{TOA}} = \\frac{M}{E_{\\text{inc}}}$$\n    For an ideal Lambertian surface, the reflected radiance, $L$, is isotropic (uniform in all directions). The total exitance $M$ is related to this radiance by integrating over the hemisphere of reflection, which yields:\n    $$M = \\pi L$$\n\n4.  **Final Expression for TOA Reflectance**: The problem states that atmospheric path radiance is negligible. This implies that the at-sensor radiance $L$ is solely due to the solar radiation reflected by the surface. Therefore, the measured radiance is the surface-reflected radiance. Substituting the expressions for $M$ and $E_{\\text{inc}}$ into the definition of reflectance yields the desired expression.\n    $$\\rho_{\\mathrm{TOA}} = \\frac{\\pi L}{E_{\\text{inc}}} = \\frac{\\pi L}{\\frac{E_0 \\cos(\\theta_s)}{d^2}}$$\n    Rearranging this gives the final expression for TOA reflectance:\n    $$\\rho_{\\mathrm{TOA}} = \\frac{\\pi L d^2}{E_0 \\cos(\\theta_s)}$$\n\n### Numerical Computations\nThe derived formula is now used to compute the required values for acquisitions A and B, rounding each final result to four significant figures.\n\nThe constant parameters are:\n-   $E_{0} = 1500\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$\n-   $\\theta_{s} = 30^{\\circ}$, so $\\cos(\\theta_s) = \\cos(30^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$\n\n**For Acquisition A**:\n-   $L_A = 60\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{sr}^{-1}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$\n-   $d_A = 0.983\\,\\mathrm{au}$\n\nThe TOA reflectance for acquisition A, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{TOA},A}$, is:\n$$\\rho_{\\mathrm{TOA},A} = \\frac{\\pi L_A d_A^2}{E_0 \\cos(\\theta_s)} = \\frac{\\pi (60) (0.983)^2}{1500 \\cos(30^{\\circ})} \\approx \\frac{182.1405}{1299.0381} \\approx 0.140211$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\rho_{\\mathrm{TOA},A} = 0.1402$.\n\n**For Acquisition B**:\n-   $L_B = 58\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{sr}^{-1}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$\n-   $d_B = 1.017\\,\\mathrm{au}$\n\nThe TOA reflectance for acquisition B, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{TOA},B}$, is:\n$$\\rho_{\\mathrm{TOA},B} = \\frac{\\pi L_B d_B^2}{E_0 \\cos(\\theta_s)} = \\frac{\\pi (58) (1.017)^2}{1500 \\cos(30^{\\circ})} \\approx \\frac{188.4616}{1299.0381} \\approx 0.145077$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\rho_{\\mathrm{TOA},B} = 0.1451$.\n\n**Ratio of Reflectances**:\nThe ratio $\\rho_{\\mathrm{TOA},B}/\\rho_{\\mathrm{TOA},A}$ is computed.
