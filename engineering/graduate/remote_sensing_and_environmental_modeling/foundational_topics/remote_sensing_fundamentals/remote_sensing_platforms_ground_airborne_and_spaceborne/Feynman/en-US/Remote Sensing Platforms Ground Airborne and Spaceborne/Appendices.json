The use of symbolic variables avoids any issues of dimensional or physical inconsistency.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a well-structured problem in the field of remote sensing that tests fundamental concepts. Therefore, a complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Dwell Time ($t_{\\mathrm{d}}$)**\n\nThe dwell time, $t_{\\mathrm{d}}$, is defined as the time interval during which a single detector element of the imaging spectrometer collects photons from a single, corresponding ground sample area. For a pushbroom sensor, the detector array is fixed, and the platform's motion sweeps the sensor's field of view across the ground.\n\nWe consider the motion in the along-track direction, which is the direction of the platform's velocity, $v$. The problem states that the along-track ground-projected pixel size is $s$. This means that the dimension of the ground area viewed by a single detector at any instant is $s$ in the direction of motion.\n\nFrom the first principles of kinematics for motion at a constant velocity, the relationship between distance, speed, and time is:\n$$\n\\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time}\n$$\nIn our context, the detector's view must travel a distance equal to the size of one ground sample, $s$, to complete the imaging of that sample and begin imaging the next adjacent one. The speed at which the sensor's footprint moves across the ground is the platform's speed, $v$. The time taken for this to occur is the dwell time, $t_{\\mathrm{d}}$.\n\nSubstituting these quantities into the kinematic equation, we have:\n$$\ns = v \\cdot t_{\\mathrm{d}}\n$$\nSolving this equation for the dwell time $t_{\\mathrm{d}}$ yields the expression:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{d}} = \\frac{s}{v}\n$$\n\n**Clarification on the Role of Altitude ($H$)**\n\nThe derivation above yields an expression for $t_{\\mathrm{d}}$ that depends only on the ground-projected pixel size $s$ and the platform speed $v$. The altitude $H$ does not appear. This is because $s$ was provided as a direct input, representing the effective pixel size on the ground.\n\nHowever, the ground-projected pixel size $s$ is itself a function of the sensor's intrinsic properties and its altitude. Specifically, for a nadir-viewing sensor, $s$ is determined by the along-track angular instantaneous field of view (IFOV) of a single detector element, denoted by $\\delta\\phi$, and the altitude $H$. For the small angles typical in remote sensing, the relationship is given by the small-angle approximation:\n$$\ns \\approx H \\cdot \\delta\\phi\n$$\nwhere $\\delta\\phi$ must be expressed in radians.\n\nIf the problem were specified in terms of the sensor's IFOV $\\delta\\phi$ instead of the ground sample distance $s$, then we would substitute this expression for $s$ into our formula for $t_{\\mathrm{d}}$:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{d}} = \\frac{H \\cdot \\delta\\phi}{v}\n$$\nIn this formulation, the altitude $H$ is critically important. For a sensor with a fixed angular resolution $\\delta\\phi$, flying at a higher altitude increases the ground pixel size $s$, which in turn increases the dwell time $t_{\\mathrm{d}}$ (assuming constant speed $v$). Thus, $H$ is an essential parameter linking the instrument's intrinsic angular resolution to the spatial and temporal characteristics of the data acquisition on the ground.\n\n**Part 2: Effect of Dwell Time on Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**\n\nThe Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is a fundamental measure of image quality. We analyze its dependence on $t_{\\mathrm{d}}$ under two limiting noise conditions, assuming constant scene radiance and system throughput.\n\nThe signal, $S$, measured by a detector element is the number of photo-electrons generated during the dwell time. This number is directly proportional to the total number of photons collected, which in turn is proportional to the duration of collection, $t_{\\mathrm{d}}$. Therefore, we can write:\n$$\nS = K \\cdot t_{\\mathrm{d}}\n$$\nwhere $K$ is a constant of proportionality that incorporates factors such as scene radiance, aperture size, optical transmission, and detector quantum efficiency.\n\nThe total noise, $N$, is the root-sum-square of all independent noise sources. The dominant noise source determines the behavior of the SNR.\n\n**Case 1: Photon-Noise-Limited (Shot-Noise-Limited) Regime**\n\nIn this regime, the dominant noise source is the inherent statistical fluctuation in the arrival of photons, known as shot noise. The arrival of photons follows a Poisson distribution. If the mean number of signal photo-electrons is $S$, the standard deviation of this signal (the shot noise, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{shot}}$) is given by:\n$$\nN \\approx \\sigma_{\\mathrm{shot}} = \\sqrt{S}\n$$\nThe SNR is the ratio of the signal to the noise:\n$$\n\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{shot}} = \\frac{S}{N} = \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{S}} = \\sqrt{S}\n$$\nSince $S$ is directly proportional to $t_{\\mathrm{d}}$, we have:\n$$\n\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{shot}} \\propto \\sqrt{t_{\\mathrm{d}}}\n$$\nThis means that in a photon-noise-limited system, the SNR improves with the square root of the dwell time. For example, to double the SNR, one must increase the dwell time by a factor of four.\n\n**Case 2: Read-Noise-Limited Regime**\n\nIn this regime, the dominant noise source is the read noise, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{read}}$. This is an approximately constant amount of noise, measured in electrons, that is introduced by the sensor electronics each time a pixel's signal is read out. It is independent of the signal level.\n$$\nN \\approx \\sigma_{\\mathrm{read}}\n$$\nThe SNR is then:\n$$\n\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{read}} = \\frac{S}{N} = \\frac{S}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{read}}}\n$$\nSince $S$ is directly proportional to $t_{\\mathrm{d}}$ and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{read}}$ is constant for a given sensor and its operating conditions:\n$$\n\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{read}} \\propto t_{\\mathrm{d}}\n$$\nThis indicates that in a read-noise-limited system (typically occurring in low-light conditions where the signal $S$ is very small), the SNR improves linearly with the dwell time. Doubling the dwell time will double the SNR.",

It does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nWe establish a Cartesian coordinate system where the camera's pinhole is at position $C = (0, 0, H)$ and the ground is the plane $z=0$. A ray of light travels from a ground point $P_g = (x_g, y_g, 0)$ to the pinhole $C$. By the principle of collinearity, the corresponding image point, the pinhole, and the ground point lie on a straight line.\n\nThe direction vector of a ray from the pinhole $C$ to the ground point $P_g$ is given by $\\vec{r} = P_g - C = (x_g, y_g, -H)$.\nIf we consider a general ray vector $\\vec{d}=(d_x, d_y, d_z)$ originating from the pinhole, any point on this ray can be parameterized as $P(t) = C + t\\vec{d} = (t d_x, t d_y, H+t d_z)$. The ground intersection occurs when the $z$-component is $0$, so $H+t d_z = 0$, which gives $t = -H/d_z$. Substituting this value of $t$ back, we find the ground coordinates:\n$$x_g = -H \\frac{d_x}{d_z}$$\n$$y_g = -H \\frac{d_y}{d_z}$$\n\nThe sensor's optical axis is tilted by an angle $\\theta$ from the vertical (the $-z$ direction) in the $x$-$z$ plane. The direction vector of the optical axis ray is therefore $\\vec{d}_{oa} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, -\\cos\\theta)$.\n\nA pixel's position on the focal plane corresponds to a small angular deviation from the optical axis. Let's define a sensor-local coordinate system $(x', y', z')$ centered at the pinhole, where the $z'$-axis is aligned with the optical axis. The axes of this system in terms of the ground frame coordinates are:\n- Along-incidence sensor direction: $\\vec{u}_{along} = (\\cos\\theta, 0, \\sin\\theta)$\n- Cross-incidence sensor direction: $\\vec{u}_{cross} = (0, 1, 0)$\n- Optical axis direction: $\\vec{d}_{oa} = \\vec{u}_{cross} \\times \\vec{u}_{along} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, -\\cos\\theta)$\n\nA ray corresponding to a pixel with small angular deviations $\\beta$ (in the along-incidence direction) and $\\alpha$ (in the cross-incidence direction) from the optical axis has a direction vector $\\vec{d}$ that can be approximated by a linear combination of these basis vectors.\n$$\\vec{d}(\\alpha, \\beta) \\approx \\vec{d}_{oa} + \\beta \\vec{u}_{along} + \\alpha \\vec{u}_{cross}$$\n$$\\vec{d}(\\alpha, \\beta) \\approx (\\sin\\theta + \\beta\\cos\\theta, \\alpha, -\\cos\\theta + \\beta\\sin\\theta)$$\nThe angular deviations for an adjacent pixel are given by the small-angle approximation: $\\Delta\\alpha \\approx \\tan(\\Delta\\alpha) = p/f$ and $\\Delta\\beta \\approx \\tan(\\Delta\\beta) = p/f$.\n\n**Part 1: Nadir Viewing ($\\theta=0$)**\nFor nadir viewing, $\\theta=0$. The optical axis is $\\vec{d}_{oa} = (0, 0, -1)$. The general ray vector becomes:\n$$\\vec{d}(\\alpha, \\beta) \\approx (\\beta, \\alpha, -1)$$\nThe ground coordinates are:\n$$x_g = -H \\frac{\\beta}{-1} = H\\beta$$\n$$y_g = -H \\frac{\\alpha}{-1} = H\\alpha$$\nThe GSD is the ground spacing for a single pixel step. A step in the sensor's along-incidence direction corresponds to a change $\\Delta\\beta = p/f$. This results in a ground spacing $\\Delta x_g = H \\Delta\\beta = H p/f$. A step in the cross-incidence direction corresponds to $\\Delta\\alpha = p/f$, resulting in a ground spacing $\\Delta y_g = H \\Delta\\alpha = H p/f$. Thus, for nadir viewing, the GSD is uniform:\n$$GSD \\approx \\frac{H p}{f}$$\n\n**Part 2: Off-Nadir Viewing ($\\theta \\neq 0$)**\nUsing the general ray vector $\\vec{d}(\\alpha, \\beta)$, the ground coordinates are:\n$$x_g(\\alpha, \\beta) = -H \\frac{\\sin\\theta + \\beta\\cos\\theta}{-\\cos\\theta + \\beta\\sin\\theta}$$\n$$y_g(\\alpha, \\beta) = -H \\frac{\\alpha}{-\\cos\\theta + \\beta\\sin\\theta}$$\nThe GSD components are found by differentiating the ground coordinates with respect to the angular deviations $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ around the central ray $(\\alpha=0, \\beta=0)$.\n\nThe cross-incidence GSD, $GSD_c$, corresponds to a step in $\\alpha$.

To find the maximum allowable IMU attitude error $\\sigma_{\\theta}$, we set $E_{RMS}$ to its maximum permitted value, $E_{req}$:\n$$ E_{\\text{req}}^2 = \\sigma_p^2 + h^2 \\sigma_{\\theta}^2 + h^2 \\beta^2 $$\nWe now rearrange this equation to solve for $\\sigma_{\\theta}$:\n$$ h^2 \\sigma_{\\theta}^2 = E_{\\text{req}}^2 - \\sigma_p^2 - h^2 \\beta^2 $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta}^2 = \\frac{E_{\\text{req}}^2 - \\sigma_p^2}{h^2} - \\beta^2 $$\nTaking the square root of both sides yields the expression for the maximum allowable IMU attitude RMS error:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta} = \\sqrt{\\frac{E_{\\text{req}}^2 - \\sigma_p^2}{h^2} - \\beta^2} $$\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\nWe substitute the given values, ensuring all units are in the SI system (meters and radians).\n- $h = 1200$ m\n- $E_{\\text{req}} = 0.25$ m\n- $\\sigma_p = 0.12$ m\n- $\\beta = 100 \\text{ microradians} = 100 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ rad} = 1 \\times 10^{-4}$ rad\n\nFirst, we compute the squared error terms:\n- $E_{\\text{req}}^2 = (0.25)^2 = 0.0625$ m$^2$\n- $\\sigma_p^2 = (0.12)^2 = 0.0144$ m$^2$\n- $h^2 = (1200)^2 = 1.44 \\times 10^6$ m$^2$\n- $\\beta^2 = (1 \\times 10^{-4})^2 = 1 \\times 10^{-8}$ rad$^2$\n\nNow, substitute these into the equation for $\\sigma_{\\theta}^2$:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta}^2 = \\frac{0.0625 - 0.0144}{1.44 \\times 10^6} - (1 \\times 10^{-8}) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta}^2 = \\frac{0.0481}{1.44 \\times 10^6} - 1 \\times 10^{-8} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta}^2 = (3.340277... \\times 10^{-8}) - (1 \\times 10^{-8}) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta}^2 = 2.340277... \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ rad}^2 $$\nNow, we take the square root to find $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ in radians:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta} = \\sqrt{2.340277... \\times 10^{-8}} \\approx 1.5298 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ rad} $$\n\nFinally, we convert the result to microradians and round to three significant figures as requested:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta} \\approx (1.5298 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ rad}) \\times \\frac{10^6 \\mu\\text{rad}}{1 \\text{ rad}} \\approx 152.98 \\mu\\text{rad} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta} \\approx 153 \\mu\\text{rad} $$\nThis is the maximum allowable IMU attitude RMS error.",
