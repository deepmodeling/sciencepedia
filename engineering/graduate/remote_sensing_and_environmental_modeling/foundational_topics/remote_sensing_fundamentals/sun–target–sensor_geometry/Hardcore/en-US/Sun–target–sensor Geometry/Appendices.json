This exercise provides foundational practice in translating observational angles—solar zenith and azimuth—into a Cartesian vector within a local East-North-Up (ENU) coordinate frame, a crucial skill for any quantitative analysis in remote sensing. Mastering this transformation from a spherical to a Cartesian system from first principles is essential for building more complex geometric and radiative transfer models .",

            "problem": "A ground site is located at latitude $35^{\\circ}$ and longitude $-120^{\\circ}$. At a particular time, the Sun is observed from this site with solar zenith angle $30^{\\circ}$ and solar azimuth angle $150^{\\circ}$, where the azimuth is measured clockwise from geographic north. Consider the local East–North–Up (ENU) reference frame, where the East axis points toward increasing longitude, the North axis points toward increasing latitude, and the Up axis is the local surface normal pointing away from the center of the Earth. Let $\\mathbf{s}$ denote the unit solar illumination direction vector pointing from the target on the ground toward the Sun in this ENU frame.\n\nUsing only fundamental geometric definitions of zenith and azimuth angles and the orthonormality of the ENU axes, derive the components of $\\mathbf{s}$ in ENU coordinates from first principles, and then evaluate them for the given angles. Treat all angles in degrees. Express the final components as the ordered triple $(s_{E}, s_{N}, s_{U})$ and round each component to four significant figures. The components are dimensionless. Provide the final ordered triple as the sole result.",
            "solution": "The problem is to determine the components of the unit solar illumination vector, $\\mathbf{s}$, in a local East–North–Up (ENU) Cartesian coordinate system. The direction of the Sun is specified by its zenith angle, $\\theta_s$, and azimuth angle, $\\phi_s$. The provided latitude and longitude of the ground site establish the location where the ENU frame is defined, but are not necessary for the geometric transformation itself.\n\nLet the ENU coordinate system be defined by a set of orthonormal basis vectors $(\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_E, \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_N, \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_U)$. The solar illumination vector, $\\mathbf{s}$, is a unit vector pointing from the target on the ground towards the Sun. It can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors:\n$$\n\\mathbf{s} = s_E \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_E + s_N \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_N + s_U \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_U\n$$\nOur goal is to find the scalar components $(s_E, s_N, s_U)$ from first principles using the given angles.\n\nThe solar zenith angle, $\\theta_s$, is defined as the angle between the local zenith (the Up direction) and the direction to the Sun. Therefore, $\\theta_s$ is the angle between the vector $\\mathbf{s}$ and the basis vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_U$. The component of $\\mathbf{s}$ along the Up axis, $s_U$, is found by projecting $\\mathbf{s}$ onto $\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_U$. Using the definition of the dot product:\n$$\ns_U = \\mathbf{s} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_U = |\\mathbf{s}| |\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_U| \\cos(\\theta_s)\n$$\nSince $\\mathbf{s}$ and $\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_U$ are unit vectors, their magnitudes are $|\\mathbf{s}| = 1$ and $|\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_U| = 1$. Thus, the Up component is:\n$$\ns_U = \\cos(\\theta_s)\n$$\n\nNext, we find the components in the horizontal (East-North) plane. We can decompose the vector $\\mathbf{s}$ into its vertical and horizontal parts:\n$$\n\\mathbf{s} = \\mathbf{s}_h + \\mathbf{s}_v\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{s}_v = s_U \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_U$ is the vertical component and $\\mathbf{s}_h = s_E \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_E + s_N \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_N$ is the horizontal component, which is the projection of $\\mathbf{s}$ onto the E-N plane.\nFrom the Pythagorean theorem applied to the right triangle formed by $\\mathbf{s}$ and its projections, the magnitude of the horizontal component $\\mathbf{s}_h$ is given by:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{s}_h| = |\\mathbf{s}| \\sin(\\theta_s) = \\sin(\\theta_s)\n$$\n\nThe solar azimuth angle, $\\phi_s$, specifies the direction of the horizontal vector $\\mathbf{s}_h$ within the E-N plane. The problem states that $\\phi_s$ is measured clockwise from geographic north. In our ENU frame, this corresponds to the angle measured clockwise from the $\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_N$ axis.\n\nTo find the North component, $s_N$, we project the horizontal vector $\\mathbf{s}_h$ onto the North axis $\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_N$. The angle between $\\mathbf{s}_h$ and $\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_N$ is, by definition, the azimuth $\\phi_s$.\n$$\ns_N = |\\mathbf{s}_h| \\cos(\\phi_s) = \\sin(\\theta_s) \\cos(\\phi_s)\n$$\n\nTo find the East component, $s_E$, we project $\\mathbf{s}_h$ onto the East axis $\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_E$. The ENU frame is a right-handed system. If North corresponds to the positive y-axis and East to the positive x-axis, the angle of the East axis measured clockwise from the North axis is $270^{\\circ}$ or $-90^{\\circ}$. Conversely, the angle of the North axis measured clockwise from the East axis is $90^{\\circ}$. The angle of the vector $\\mathbf{s}_h$ with respect to the East axis, measured clockwise, is $(\\phi_s - 90^{\\circ})$. Therefore, the projection onto the East axis is:\n$$\ns_E = |\\mathbf{s}_h| \\cos(\\phi_s - 90^{\\circ})\n$$\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\cos(x - 90^{\\circ}) = \\sin(x)$, we obtain:\n$$\ns_E = |\\mathbf{s}_h| \\sin(\\phi_s) = \\sin(\\theta_s) \\sin(\\phi_s)\n$$\nThis derivation from first principles yields the transformation formulas.\n\nIn summary, the components of the solar illumination vector $\\mathbf{s}$ are:\n$$\ns_E = \\sin(\\theta_s) \\sin(\\phi_s)\n$$\n$$\ns_N = \\sin(\\theta_s) \\cos(\\phi_s)\n$$\n$$\ns_U = \\cos(\\theta_s)\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values: $\\theta_s = 30^{\\circ}$ and $\\phi_s = 150^{\\circ}$.\nWe have the trigonometric values:\n$\\sin(30^{\\circ}) = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$\n$\\cos(30^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$\n$\\sin(150^{\\circ}) = \\sin(180^{\\circ} - 30^{\\circ}) = \\sin(30^{\\circ}) = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$\n$\\cos(150^{\\circ}) = \\cos(180^{\\circ} - 30^{\\circ}) = -\\cos(30^{\\circ}) = -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$\n\nSubstituting these into the component equations:\n$s_E = \\sin(30^{\\circ}) \\sin(150^{\\circ}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$\n$s_N = \\sin(30^{\\circ}) \\cos(150^{\\circ}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}$\n$s_U = \\cos(30^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$\n\nThe final step is to evaluate these numerically and round to four significant figures.\n$s_E = 0.2500$\n$s_N = -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\approx -0.4330127... \\approx -0.4330$\n$s_U = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx 0.8660254... \\approx 0.8660$\n\nThe components of the unit solar illumination vector $\\mathbf{s}$ in ENU coordinates are $(0.2500, -0.4330, 0.8660)$.",

Let the solar illumination direction be characterized by the solar zenith angle $i$ and solar azimuth angle $\\phi_{s}$, and let the sensor view direction be characterized by the view zenith angle $e$ and view azimuth angle $\\phi_{v}$. In the standard bidirectional geometry used for the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF), the phase angle $g$ is defined as the angle between the unit vectors pointing from the surface to the Sun and from the surface to the sensor.

            "solution": "The problem requires a derivation of the cosine of the phase angle, $g$, in terms of sun-sensor geometry, and an analysis of a special case. We begin by establishing a coordinate system and representing the directional vectors.\n\nLet the point of interest on the horizontally planar surface be the origin of a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system $(x, y, z)$. The surface lies in the $x-y$ plane, so the upward-pointing unit normal vector is $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}} = (0, 0, 1)$.\n\nThe solar illumination direction is described by the unit vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\Omega}}_s$, which points from the surface target towards the Sun. Its orientation is given by the solar zenith angle $i$, the angle between $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}$ and $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\Omega}}_s$, and the solar azimuth angle $\\phi_s$. In spherical coordinates, a unit vector is defined by its zenith and azimuth angles. Converting to Cartesian coordinates, we have:\n$$ \\hat{\\mathbf{\\Omega}}_s = (\\sin(i) \\cos(\\phi_s), \\sin(i) \\sin(\\phi_s), \\cos(i)) $$\nHere, $\\cos(i)$ is the projection of $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\Omega}}_s$ onto the $z$-axis, and $\\sin(i)$ is the magnitude of its projection onto the $x-y$ plane.\n\nSimilarly, the sensor view direction is described by the unit vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\Omega}}_v$, which points from the surface target towards the sensor. Its orientation is given by the view zenith angle $e$ and the view azimuth angle $\\phi_v$. Its Cartesian representation is:\n$$ \\hat{\\mathbf{\\Omega}}_v = (\\sin(e) \\cos(\\phi_v), \\sin(e) \\sin(\\phi_v), \\cos(e)) $$\n\nThe phase angle $g$ is defined as the angle between the vectors $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\Omega}}_s$ and $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\Omega}}_v$. According to the definition of the dot product for two unit vectors, the cosine of the angle between them is their dot product:\n$$ \\cos(g) = \\hat{\\mathbf{\\Omega}}_s \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{\\Omega}}_v $$\nSubstituting the Cartesian components, we compute the dot product:\n$$ \\cos(g) = (\\sin(i) \\cos(\\phi_s)) (\\sin(e) \\cos(\\phi_v)) + (\\sin(i) \\sin(\\phi_s)) (\\sin(e) \\sin(\\phi_v)) + (\\cos(i)) (\\cos(e)) $$\nWe can factor out the terms $\\sin(i) \\sin(e)$:\n$$ \\cos(g) = \\sin(i) \\sin(e) [\\cos(\\phi_s) \\cos(\\phi_v) + \\sin(\\phi_s) \\sin(\\phi_v)] + \\cos(i) \\cos(e) $$\nUsing the trigonometric identity for the cosine of a difference, $\\cos(A - B) = \\cos(A)\\cos(B) + \\sin(A)\\sin(B)$, with $A = \\phi_v$ and $B = \\phi_s$, we get:\n$$ \\cos(g) = \\sin(i) \\sin(e) \\cos(\\phi_v - \\phi_s) + \\cos(i) \\cos(e) $$\nThe relative azimuth difference is given as $\\Delta \\phi = \\phi_v - \\phi_s$. Substituting this definition, we arrive at the first required expression:\n$$ \\cos(g) = \\cos(i) \\cos(e) + \\sin(i) \\sin(e) \\cos(\\Delta \\phi) $$\n\nNext, we explain from first principles why the backscattering geometry corresponds to $g \\approx 0$. Backscattering is the physical process where radiation is scattered directly back towards its source. In the sun–target–sensor geometry, this means the sensor is positioned along the same line-of-sight as the sun, but in the opposite direction from the sun's illumination path. The vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\Omega}}_s$ points from the target to the sun. The vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\Omega}}_v$ points from the target to the sensor. For the sensor to intercept backscattered radiation, it must be located in precisely the same direction from the target as the sun. Therefore, the direction vector to the sensor, $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\Omega}}_v$, must be coincident with the direction vector to the sun, $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\Omega}}_s$. Mathematically, this is expressed as $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\Omega}}_v \\approx \\hat{\\mathbf{\\Omega}}_s$. The phase angle $g$ is defined as the angle between these two vectors. If the vectors are nearly identical, the angle between them is, by definition, nearly zero. Thus, backscattering geometry corresponds to $g \\approx 0$. This configuration is also known as the \"hot spot\" in remote sensing.\n\nFinally, we impose the constraints $i = e$ and $g = 0$ to find the condition on the azimuth angles. Setting $g = 0$ implies $\\cos(g) = \\cos(0) = 1$. Our derived expression becomes:\n$$ 1 = \\cos(i) \\cos(e) + \\sin(i) \\sin(e) \\cos(\\Delta \\phi) $$\nNow, we apply the constraint $i = e$:\n$$ 1 = \\cos(i) \\cos(i) + \\sin(i) \\sin(i) \\cos(\\Delta \\phi) $$\n$$ 1 = \\cos^2(i) + \\sin^2(i) \\cos(\\Delta \\phi) $$\nUsing the fundamental trigonometric identity $\\sin^2(i) + \\cos^2(i) = 1$, we can write $1 - \\cos^2(i) = \\sin^2(i)$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$ \\sin^2(i) = \\sin^2(i) \\cos(\\Delta \\phi) $$\nTo solve for $\\cos(\\Delta \\phi)$, we must consider two cases.\n\nCase 1: $i \\neq 0$. The zenith angle $i$ is typically in the range $[0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$. For $i \\neq 0$, we have $\\sin(i) \\neq 0$, and therefore $\\sin^2(i) \\neq 0$. We can safely divide both sides of the equation by $\\sin^2(i)$:\n$$ 1 = \\cos(\\Delta \\phi) $$\nThe solutions for $\\Delta \\phi$ are $\\Delta \\phi = 2k\\pi$ for any integer $k$. The principal value is $\\Delta \\phi = 0$. This implies $\\phi_v - \\phi_s = 0$, or $\\phi_v = \\phi_s$. This is the condition on the azimuth angles for an exact backscattering geometry ($g=0$) when the solar and view zenith angles are equal and non-zero.\n\nCase 2: $i = 0$. If the solar zenith angle is $i=0$, then the illumination is from directly overhead (nadir). The constraint $i=e$ implies $e=0$, meaning the sensor is also viewing from directly overhead. In this situation, the equation becomes $\\sin^2(0) = \\sin^2(0) \\cos(\\Delta \\phi)$, which simplifies to $0 = 0$. This equation is true for any value of $\\cos(\\Delta \\phi)$. This is a geometric degeneracy. When both the sun and the sensor are at zenith ($i=e=0$), their azimuth angles $\\phi_s$ and $\\phi_v$ are undefined or irrelevant. The directional vectors $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\Omega}}_s$ and $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\Omega}}_v$ both become $(0, 0, 1)$, so they are perfectly aligned, and the phase angle $g$ is always $0$ regardless of the azimuths.\n\nThe problem asks for the value of the required relative azimuth difference $\\Delta \\phi$. Except for the degenerate case where $i = e = 0$, the condition is definitively $\\cos(\\Delta \\phi) = 1$. The principal value for this condition is $\\Delta\\phi = 0$. The requested numerical value, expressed in radians, is $0$.",

Such asurface has isotropic reflectance, meaning it appears equally bright from all viewing directions, independent of the illumination direction.\n- If $k \\neq 1$, the surface is anisotropic. The value of $k$ determines the nature and degree of this anisotropy. For most natural surfaces, $0 < k < 1$, which makes $k-1$ negative.
