A solution will be formulated.\n\n### Solution Formulation\nThe spectral radiance of a blackbody per unit wavelength, $B_\\lambda$, as a function of wavelength $\\lambda$ and absolute temperature $T$, is given by Planck's law:\n$$B_\\lambda(\\lambda, T) = \\frac{2hc^2}{\\lambda^5} \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{hc}{\\lambda k_B T}\\right) - 1}$$\nwhere $h$ is the Planck constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nTo find the wavelength of peak emission, $\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$, for a given temperature $T$, we must find the maximum of $B_\\lambda(\\lambda, T)$ with respect to $\\lambda$. This is accomplished by setting the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial B_\\lambda}{\\partial \\lambda}$ equal to zero.\n$$\\frac{\\partial B_\\lambda}{\\partial \\lambda} = 0$$\nLet's introduce a dimensionless variable $x = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda k_B T}$. The expression for $B_\\lambda$ can be written in terms of $x$ and $\\lambda$:\n$$B_\\lambda(\\lambda, T) = 2hc^2 \\lambda^{-5} (\\exp(x) - 1)^{-1}$$\nWe apply the product rule for differentiation with respect to $\\lambda$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial B_\\lambda}{\\partial \\lambda} = 2hc^2 \\left[ (-5\\lambda^{-6})(\\exp(x) - 1)^{-1} + \\lambda^{-5} \\frac{d}{d\\lambda}(\\exp(x) - 1)^{-1} \\right]$$\nUsing the chain rule for the second term, where $\\frac{dx}{d\\lambda} = \\frac{d}{d\\lambda}\\left(\\frac{hc}{\\lambda k_B T}\\right) = -\\frac{hc}{\\lambda^2 k_B T} = -\\frac{x}{\\lambda}$:\n$$\\frac{d}{d\\lambda}(\\exp(x) - 1)^{-1} = -(\\exp(x) - 1)^{-2} \\exp(x) \\frac{dx}{d\\lambda} = -(\\exp(x) - 1)^{-2} \\exp(x) \\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nSubstituting this back into the derivative of $B_\\lambda$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial B_\\lambda}{\\partial \\lambda} = 2hc^2 \\left[ -5\\lambda^{-6}(\\exp(x) - 1)^{-1} + \\lambda^{-5} (\\exp(x) - 1)^{-2} \\exp(x) \\frac{x}{\\lambda} \\right]$$\nSetting the derivative to zero and factoring out common non-zero terms ($2hc^2 \\lambda^{-6} (\\exp(x) - 1)^{-1}$):\n$$0 = -5 + \\frac{\\lambda^{-5} x \\exp(x)}{\\lambda (\\exp(x) - 1)^2} \\frac{\\lambda^6 (\\exp(x) - 1)}{1} = -5 + \\frac{x \\exp(x)}{\\exp(x) - 1}$$\nThis gives the condition for the peak-emission wavelength:\n$$5 = \\frac{x \\exp(x)}{\\exp(x) - 1}$$\nRearranging this equation yields a transcendental equation for the dimensionless constant $x$:\n$$5(\\exp(x) - 1) = x \\exp(x)$$\n$$5\\exp(x) - 5 = x \\exp(x)$$\n$$(5 - x)\\exp(x) = 5$$\n$$5 - x = 5\\exp(-x)$$\n$$x + 5\\exp(-x) - 5 = 0$$\nThis is the required condition. The solution to this equation is a constant, which we will denote as $\\alpha$. Numerical methods yield its value:\n$$\\alpha \\approx 4.96511423174$$\nFrom the definition of $x$, we have $\\alpha = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda_{\\text{max}} k_B T}$.\nSolving for $\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$ gives the analytic expression for the peak-emission wavelength, which is Wien's displacement law:\n$$\\lambda_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{hc}{\\alpha k_B T} = \\frac{b}{T}$$\nwhere $b = \\frac{hc}{\\alpha k_B}$ is Wien's displacement constant.\n\nNext, we compute the change in the peak-emission wavelength, $\\Delta \\lambda$, as the surface cools from $T_1 = 320\\,\\mathrm{K}$ to $T_2 = 285\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\nThe peak wavelength at $T_1$ is $\\lambda_1 = \\frac{b}{T_1}$.\nThe peak wavelength at $T_2$ is $\\lambda_2 = \\frac{b}{T_2}$.\nThe change in wavelength is:\n$$\\Delta \\lambda = \\lambda_2 - \\lambda_1 = \\frac{b}{T_2} - \\frac{b}{T_1} = b \\left(\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1}\\right)$$\nFirst, let's calculate the value of Wien's constant, $b$:\n$$b = \\frac{(6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s})(2.99792458 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}})}{(4.96511423174)(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}})}$$\n$$b \\approx 2.897771955 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m\\,K}$$\nNow, we substitute the values of $b$, $T_1$, and $T_2$ into the expression for $\\Delta \\lambda$:\n$$\\Delta \\lambda = (2.897771955 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m\\,K}) \\left(\\frac{1}{285\\,\\mathrm{K}} - \\frac{1}{320\\,\\mathrm{K}}\\right)$$\n$$\\Delta \\lambda = (2.897771955 \\times 10^{-3}) \\left(\\frac{320 - 285}{285 \\times 320}\\right) \\,\\mathrm{m}$$\n$$\\Delta \\lambda = (2.897771955 \\times 10^{-3}) \\left(\\frac{35}{91200}\\right) \\,\\mathrm{m}$$\n$$\\Delta \\lambda \\approx 1.112108 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\nThe problem asks for the result in micrometers ($\\mu\\mathrm{m}$), where $1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n$$\\Delta \\lambda \\approx 1.112108\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the final numerical answer is $1.112\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n\n### Interpretation\nThe positive sign of the change $\\Delta \\lambda$ indicates that as the surface cools from $T_1$ to $T_2$, the wavelength of maximum thermal emission shifts to a longer wavelength. This is a direct consequence of Wien's displacement law ($\\lambda_{\\text{max}} \\propto 1/T$). At the afternoon temperature of $T_1=320\\,\\mathrm{K}$, the peak emission is at $\\lambda_1 = b/T_1 \\approx 9.06\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. Before dawn, at $T_2=285\\,\\mathrm{K}$, the peak shifts to $\\lambda_2 = b/T_2 \\approx 10.17\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. Both of these wavelengths fall within the primary atmospheric window for Thermal Infrared (TIR) remote sensing, which is approximately $8-14\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. This window is critical because atmospheric gases absorb very little radiation in this range, allowing satellite and aircraft sensors to accurately measure radiation emitted directly from the Earth's surface. The diurnal shift in the peak emission wavelength by $\\approx 1.112\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ is significant. Multi-spectral TIR sensors with channels designed to capture different parts of this spectrum (e.g., a channel centered at $9\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and another at $10.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$) can detect this shift. This information is fundamental for environmental models that estimate surface properties like thermal inertia, which is related to soil composition and moisture content, and for monitoring the energy balance of the land surface during its daily cycle.",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically reviewed and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of radiative transfer, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and objectively formulated. We may therefore proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts: first, a derivation of the relationship between at-sensor spectral radiance and surface spectral reflectance under a set of simplifying assumptions; second, a numerical calculation of the surface reflectance using provided data.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the At-Sensor Radiance Equation**\n\nWe begin from first principles, as requested.\n\nSpectral irradiance, denoted $E_{\\lambda}$, is the radiant flux (power) per unit area incident upon a surface, per unit wavelength interval. Its units are typically $\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$. Spectral radiance, denoted $L_{\\lambda}$, is the radiant flux per unit projected area, per unit solid angle, and per unit wavelength interval. Its units are typically $\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{sr}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$.\n\nThe top-of-atmosphere (TOA) solar spectral irradiance, $E_{\\lambda,\\odot}$, is the spectral irradiance from the Sun incident on a plane oriented perpendicular to the Sun's rays at the top of Earth's atmosphere. The Sun's radiant power spreads out spherically. According to the inverse-square law, the irradiance at a distance $r$ from the Sun is inversely proportional to the square of that distance. Therefore, the TOA solar spectral irradiance at an arbitrary Earth-Sun distance $r$ can be related to the known value at the mean Earth-Sun distance ($r_{1\\,\\mathrm{AU}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{AU}$) by the following equation:\n$$E_{\\lambda,\\odot}(r) = E_{\\lambda,\\odot}(1\\,\\mathrm{AU}) \\left(\\frac{r_{1\\,\\mathrm{AU}}}{r}\\right)^2$$\nThis equation provides the quantitative dependence on the Earth-Sun distance.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the at-sensor spectral radiance, $L_{\\lambda}$. The derivation proceeds step-by-step from the top of the atmosphere down to the surface, and then back up to the sensor.\n\n1.  **Solar Irradiance at the Surface**: The TOA solar spectral irradiance on a horizontal surface is the projection of the collimated beam, given by $E_{\\lambda,\\odot} \\cos(\\theta_0)$, where $\\theta_0$ is the solar zenith angle. As this radiation travels down through the atmosphere to the surface, its direct component is attenuated by the downwelling direct-beam spectral transmittance, $T_{\\lambda,\\downarrow}$. Based on the problem's assumption to neglect path radiance, we only consider the direct attenuated beam. Thus, the direct solar spectral irradiance incident on the horizontal surface, $E_{\\lambda, \\mathrm{surf}}$, is:\n    $$E_{\\lambda, \\mathrm{surf}} = E_{\\lambda,\\odot} \\cos(\\theta_0) T_{\\lambda,\\downarrow}$$\n\n2.  **Radiance Reflected from the Surface**: The surface is assumed to be Lambertian. A Lambertian surface reflects isotropically, meaning the radiance of the reflected light is independent of the viewing direction. The relationship between the total hemispherical spectral exitance ($M_\\lambda$) and the incident spectral irradiance ($E_{\\lambda, \\mathrm{surf}}$) is $M_\\lambda = \\rho_\\lambda E_{\\lambda, \\mathrm{surf}}$, where $\\rho_\\lambda$ is the surface spectral reflectance (or albedo). For a Lambertian surface, the reflected spectral radiance, $L_{\\lambda, \\mathrm{surf}}$, is uniform in all directions and is related to the exitance by $M_\\lambda = \\pi L_{\\lambda, \\mathrm{surf}}$. Combining these, we find the relationship between the reflected radiance and the incident irradiance:\n    $$L_{\\lambda, \\mathrm{surf}} = \\frac{\\rho_\\lambda E_{\\lambda, \\mathrm{surf}}}{\\pi}$$\n    Substituting the expression for $E_{\\lambda, \\mathrm{surf}}$ from step 1:\n    $$L_{\\lambda, \\mathrm{surf}} = \\frac{\\rho_\\lambda}{\\pi} E_{\\lambda,\\odot} \\cos(\\theta_0) T_{\\lambda,\\downarrow}$$\n\n3.  **Radiance at the Sensor**: The radiance reflected from the surface travels up towards the satellite sensor. This upwelling radiance is attenuated by the upwelling direct-beam spectral transmittance, $T_{\\lambda,\\uparrow}$. The problem explicitly states that path radiance (atmospheric scattering into the sensor's path) is negligible. Therefore, the at-sensor spectral radiance, $L_{\\lambda}$, is the attenuated surface-leaving radiance:\n    $$L_{\\lambda} = L_{\\lambda, \\mathrm{surf}} T_{\\lambda,\\uparrow}$$\n    Substituting the expression for $L_{\\lambda, \\mathrm{surf}}$ from step 2:\n    $$L_{\\lambda} = \\left(\\frac{\\rho_\\lambda}{\\pi} E_{\\lambda,\\odot} \\cos(\\theta_0) T_{\\lambda,\\downarrow}\\right) T_{\\lambda,\\uparrow}$$\n    The problem defines the total two-way spectral transmittance as $T_{\\lambda} = T_{\\lambda,\\downarrow} T_{\\lambda,\\uparrow}$. Using this definition, we arrive at the final expression relating the at-sensor spectral radiance to the surface spectral reflectance:\n    $$L_{\\lambda} = \\frac{\\rho_\\lambda E_{\\lambda,\\odot} \\cos(\\theta_0) T_{\\lambda}}{\\pi}$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Surface Reflectance**\n\nTo compute the surface spectral reflectance, $\\rho_{\\lambda}$, we first rearrange the derived equation:\n$$\\rho_{\\lambda} = \\frac{\\pi L_{\\lambda}}{E_{\\lambda,\\odot} \\cos(\\theta_0) T_{\\lambda}}$$\n\nWe now assemble the necessary numerical values from the problem statement.\n\n1.  **At-sensor spectral radiance**: $L_{\\lambda} = 0.06132\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{sr}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$.\n\n2.  **TOA solar spectral irradiance, $E_{\\lambda,\\odot}$**: We must adjust the provided value for the actual Earth-Sun distance $r = 0.983\\,\\mathrm{AU}$.\n    $$E_{\\lambda,\\odot}(r) = E_{\\lambda,\\odot}(1\\,\\mathrm{AU}) \\left(\\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{AU}}{r}\\right)^2 = (1.90\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{nm}^{-1}) \\left(\\frac{1}{0.983}\\right)^2$$\n\n3.  **Solar zenith angle**: $\\theta_{0} = 40^\\circ$.\n\n4.  **Total two-way spectral transmittance, $T_{\\lambda}$**:\n    $$T_{\\lambda} = T_{\\lambda,\\downarrow} T_{\\lambda,\\uparrow} = 0.82 \\times 0.78 = 0.6396$$\n\nNow we substitute these values into the expression for $\\rho_{\\lambda}$:\n$$\\rho_{\\lambda} = \\frac{\\pi \\times 0.06132}{\\left(1.90 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{0.983}\\right)^2\\right) \\times \\cos(40^\\circ) \\times (0.6396)}$$\n\nLet's compute the terms in the denominator:\n$$E_{\\lambda,\\odot} = 1.90 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{0.983}\\right)^2 \\approx 1.90 \\times 1.034883 \\approx 1.9662777\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$$\n$$\\cos(40^\\circ) \\approx 0.7660444$$\n\nSubstituting these intermediate results:\n$$\\rho_{\\lambda} = \\frac{\\pi \\times 0.06132}{(1.9662777) \\times (0.7660444) \\times (0.6396)}$$\n$$\\rho_{\\lambda} = \\frac{0.19264175}{0.9633593} \\approx 0.199964$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

The SAR transmits a monochromatic plane wave with a carrier frequency $f_0$. The phase of the electromagnetic wave is a function of the path length it travels. For a monostatic radar, the wave travels from the radar to the target and back, a round-trip path.\n\nLet $R(t)$ be the instantaneous range from the radar to the target at time $t$. The total round-trip path length is $L(t) = 2R(t)$. The phase of the received signal relative to a reference oscillator at the transmitted frequency $f_0$ is determined by this path length. The phase difference, often called the baseband phase, is given by the total path length measured in units of wavelength $\\lambda_0$, multiplied by $2\\pi$. A sign convention must be established for the baseband phase. We define it as $\\phi(t) = -k_0 L(t)$, where $k_0 = 2\\pi / \\lambda_0$ is the wavenumber of the transmitted wave. This negative sign is standard in radar signal processing, arising from the definition of the baseband signal via complex demodulation.\n\nThe wavelength is related to the frequency $f_0$ and the speed of light $c$ by $\\lambda_0 = c/f_0$. Substituting this and $L(t)=2R(t)$ into the phase expression, we get:\n$$\n\\phi(t) = - \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda_0} \\left(2R(t)\\right) = - \\frac{4\\pi f_0 R(t)}{c}\n$$\nThe instantaneous Doppler frequency shift, $f_D$, is the time rate of change of this phase, divided by $2\\pi$.\n$$\nf_D = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\frac{d\\phi(t)}{dt}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\phi(t)$:\n$$\nf_D = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( - \\frac{4\\pi f_0 R(t)}{c} \\right) = - \\frac{2f_0}{c} \\frac{dR(t)}{dt}\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{dR(t)}{dt}$ represents the rate of change of range, which is the target's line-of-sight radial velocity. The problem specifies a velocity $v_r = 1.25 \\text{ m/s}$ *toward* the radar. A velocity toward the radar means the range $R(t)$ is decreasing, so its time derivative is negative. Let's align our variables with the problem's sign convention, which states that an approaching target has $v_r > 0$. If we define $v_r$ as the speed of approach, then the rate of change of range is:\n$$\n\\frac{dR(t)}{dt} = -v_r\n$$\nSubstituting this into our expression for the Doppler shift:\n$$\nf_D = - \\frac{2f_0}{c} (-v_r) = \\frac{2 v_r f_0}{c}\n$$\nThis derived expression is consistent with the problem's sign convention: for an approaching target, $v_r > 0$, which yields a positive Doppler frequency shift, $f_D > 0$.

The SAR processor uses a matched filter to compress the signal energy from a point target into a single resolution cell. This filter is designed based on the expected phase history of a *stationary* target. The motion of the SAR platform relative to a stationary target induces a quadratic phase history, which corresponds to a linear frequency modulation known as the Doppler chirp.\n\nThe Doppler term $f_D = 2 v_r f_0 / c$ derived above, arising from the target's own radial velocity $v_r$, affects this process in two primary ways:\n\n1.  **Azimuth Position Shift:** The target's radial velocity superimposes a constant frequency offset $f_D$ onto the Doppler chirp generated by the platform's motion. The SAR processor's azimuth compression algorithm, typically implemented using a Fourier transform, maps Doppler frequencies to along-track spatial positions. The zero-Doppler frequency corresponds to the position directly broadside to the sensor's path. A target with an intrinsic Doppler shift $f_D$ will appear to the processor as if its zero-Doppler point is shifted. Consequently, after processing, the target's energy is focused at an incorrect azimuth position in the final SAR image. The magnitude of this along-track displacement is directly proportional to $f_D$ and the slant range, and inversely proportional to the platform velocity.\n\n2.  **Azimuth Defocusing and Resolution Degradation:** The matched filter in a standard SAR processor is built on the assumption that $v_r = 0$. The presence of a non-zero $v_r$ introduces a phase error into the signal relative to the filter's replica. The primary effect of a constant $v_r$ is the linear phase ramp corresponding to the frequency shift $f_D$, which causes the aforementioned position shift. However, true defocusing (blurring) arises from uncompensated phase errors that are quadratic or of higher order. While a perfectly constant $v_r$ only introduces a linear phase error, in practice, several factors can introduce higher-order errors related to target motion. For instance, over the synthetic aperture time (which can be several seconds for spaceborne SAR), the viewing geometry changes, meaning the projection of the target's velocity vector onto the radar line-of-sight may not be constant. This effective radial acceleration introduces a quadratic phase error. Furthermore, if the target motion causes it to migrate through range resolution cells (\"range walk\"), and this is not corrected, the coherent integration is smeared, also leading to a defocused, or blurred, response in the azimuth direction. This blurring broadens the main lobe of the system's impulse response function, degrading the along-track resolution.\n\nIn summary, the Doppler shift due to target radial velocity causes a mis-registration of the target's position in the along-track direction and can lead to a degradation of focusing and resolution if not properly compensated for in the SAR processor.",
