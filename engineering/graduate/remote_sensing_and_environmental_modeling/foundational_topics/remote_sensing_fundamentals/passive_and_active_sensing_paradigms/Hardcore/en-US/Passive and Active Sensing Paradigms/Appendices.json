            "problem": "A satellite-borne imaging sensor operates at nadir and forms an image by mapping a single detector element’s angular acceptance onto the Earth’s surface. The instantaneous field of view (IFOV) is defined as the full angular subtense, in radians, of one detector element as seen from the sensor’s entrance pupil. The ground sample distance (GSD) is defined as the linear size of the ground-projected footprint corresponding to that single detector element, measured along a locally flat tangent plane at the point directly beneath the sensor.

The quantities $h$, IFOV, and GSD are standard parameters in this field.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary information and clear instructions to derive a formula and then compute a numerical value. A unique solution exists.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, technical language, free from ambiguity or subjectivity.\n- **Conclusion:** The problem is free of scientific flaws, incompleteness, contradictions, or other invalidating characteristics. It is a valid, well-posed problem in applied physics and engineering.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. The solution will now be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the GSD Expression\nLet the satellite be at a point $S$ at an altitude $h$ above a locally flat tangent plane representing the Earth's surface. The point on the surface directly beneath the satellite is the nadir point, let's call it $N$. The distance from $S$ to $N$ is $h$.\n\nThe IFOV is the full angular width of the cone of view for a single detector element. Let us denote the IFOV by the angle $\\theta$. Since the sensor is operating at nadir, the altitude line segment $SN$ is the axis of this cone and is perpendicular to the ground plane.\n\nThe cone of view intersects the ground plane, forming a footprint. The GSD is defined as the linear size (diameter) of this footprint. Let the GSD be denoted by $D_{GSD}$.\n\nWe can analyze the geometry using a right-angled triangle. Consider a cross-section of the viewing cone through its axis. This forms an isosceles triangle with vertex at the satellite $S$ and base on the ground plane, which is the GSD. The height of this triangle is the altitude $h$. The angle at the vertex $S$ is the IFOV, $\\theta$.\n\nIf we bisect this isosceles triangle along its axis of symmetry (the altitude line $SN$), we obtain two identical right-angled triangles. Each right-angled triangle has:\n- One vertex at the satellite $S$.\n- A height equal to the altitude, $h$.\n- A base of length $\\frac{D_{GSD}}{2}$.\n- The angle at the vertex $S$ is half of the IFOV, which is $\\frac{\\theta}{2}$.\n\nFrom the definition of the tangent function in a right-angled triangle, we have:\n$$\n\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{adjacent}} = \\frac{D_{GSD}/2}{h}\n$$\nSolving this equation for the GSD, $D_{GSD}$, we get the exact geometric expression:\n$$\nD_{GSD} = 2h \\tan\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\theta$ represents the IFOV.\n\n### Justification of the Small-Angle Approximation\nThe problem asks to evaluate the GSD for an IFOV of $\\theta = 30\\,\\mathrm{\\mu rad}$. In standard SI units, this is $\\theta = 30 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{rad}$. The argument of the tangent function is $\\frac{\\theta}{2} = 15 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{rad}$.\n\nThis angle is extremely small. For an angle $x$ expressed in radians, where $|x| \\ll 1$, the Taylor series expansion for $\\tan(x)$ is:\n$$\n\\tan(x) = x + \\frac{x^3}{3} + \\frac{2x^5}{15} + O(x^7)\n$$\nThe small-angle approximation consists of retaining only the leading term, i.e., $\\tan(x) \\approx x$.\n\nTo justify this from first principles, we can evaluate the magnitude of the next term in the series to quantify the error. Let $x = \\frac{\\theta}{2} = 15 \\times 10^{-6}$.\nThe first term is $x = 15 \\times 10^{-6}$.\nThe second term is $\\frac{x^3}{3} = \\frac{(15 \\times 10^{-6})^3}{3} = \\frac{3375 \\times 10^{-18}}{3} = 1125 \\times 10^{-18} = 1.125 \\times 10^{-15}$.\n\nThe relative error incurred by using the approximation $\\tan(x) \\approx x$ is approximately the ratio of the second term to the first term:\n$$\n\\text{Relative Error} \\approx \\frac{x^3/3}{x} = \\frac{x^2}{3} = \\frac{(15 \\times 10^{-6})^2}{3} = \\frac{225 \\times 10^{-12}}{3} = 75 \\times 10^{-12}\n$$\nThis relative error is on the order of $10^{-10}$, which is far below any practical precision requirement in remote sensing applications and orders of magnitude smaller than the rounding requirement to three significant figures. Therefore, the use of the small-angle approximation is fully justified.\n\nApplying the approximation $\\tan(\\frac{\\theta}{2}) \\approx \\frac{\\theta}{2}$ to the exact GSD formula, we obtain:\n$$\nD_{GSD} \\approx 2h \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) = h \\theta\n$$\nSo, for small angles, the GSD is simply the product of the altitude and the IFOV (in radians).\n\n### Calculation of the GSD\nWe are given:\n- Altitude, $h = 500\\,\\mathrm{km}$\n- IFOV, $\\theta = 30\\,\\mathrm{\\mu rad}$\n\nFirst, we must convert these values to a consistent set of units (meters and radians).\nThe altitude in meters is:\n$$\nh = 500\\,\\mathrm{km} = 500 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{m} = 5 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe IFOV in radians is:\n$$\n\\theta = 30\\,\\mathrm{\\mu rad} = 30 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{rad} = 3 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{rad}\n$$\nNow, we can calculate the GSD using the simplified formula:\n$$\nD_{GSD} = h \\theta = (5 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{m}) \\times (3 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{rad})\n$$\nThe radians unit is dimensionless, so the result will be in meters.\n$$\nD_{GSD} = (5 \\times 3) \\times (10^5 \\times 10^{-5})\\,\\mathrm{m} = 15 \\times 10^0\\,\\mathrm{m} = 15\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value of $15\\,\\mathrm{m}$ can be expressed as $15.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$ to meet this requirement.",

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Calculation\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of One-Way Transmittance**\n\nThe problem states that for a collimated beam in a homogeneous attenuating medium, the rate of change of beam irradiance with respect to path length is proportional to the local irradiance. Let $I(r)$ be the irradiance of the beam at a distance $r$ along its path from the source. The rate of change of irradiance with path length is $\\frac{dI}{dr}$. Since extinction causes a loss of irradiance, the change is negative. The constant of proportionality is the extinction coefficient, $\\beta$. This relationship is formalized as the following first-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dI(r)}{dr} = -\\beta I(r)\n$$\nTo solve this equation, we can use the method of separation of variables:\n$$\n\\frac{dI}{I} = -\\beta dr\n$$\nWe integrate this equation from the source at path length $r=0$ to an arbitrary path length $r$. Let the irradiance at the source be $I(0) = I_0$.\n$$\n\\int_{I_0}^{I(r)} \\frac{dI'}{I'} = \\int_{0}^{r} -\\beta dr'\n$$\nThe integration yields:\n$$\n[\\ln(I')]_{I_0}^{I(r)} = - \\beta [r']_{0}^{r}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(I(r)) - \\ln(I_0) = -\\beta r\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{I(r)}{I_0}\\right) = -\\beta r\n$$\nBy exponentiating both sides, we solve for the irradiance $I(r)$:\n$$\n\\frac{I(r)}{I_0} = \\exp(-\\beta r)\n$$\nThe one-way line-of-sight transmittance, denoted by $\\tau(r)$, is defined as the fraction of the initial irradiance that remains after traversing a path of length $r$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\tau(r) = \\frac{I(r)}{I_0} = \\exp(-\\beta r)\n$$\nThis is the Beer-Lambert law for a homogeneous medium.\n\n**Part 2: Expression for Two-Way Transmittance**\n\nThe LiDAR system is an active sensor. It transmits a pulse of light to a target and measures the signal that is scattered back. The total path involves two segments:\n1. The outbound path from the LiDAR instrument to the target, of length $R$.\n2. The inbound path from the target back to the LiDAR instrument, also of length $R$.\n\nThe transmittance for the outbound path, $\\tau_{\\text{out}}$, is the one-way transmittance over the distance $R$:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\text{out}} = \\tau(R) = \\exp(-\\beta R)\n$$\nAssuming the atmospheric properties are constant, the transmittance for the inbound path, $\\tau_{\\text{in}}$, is identical:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\text{in}} = \\tau(R) = \\exp(-\\beta R)\n$$\nThe two-way atmospheric transmittance, $\\tau_{2\\text{-way}}$, is the fraction of the initially transmitted pulse energy that survives both the outbound and inbound journeys to be available for detection. It is the product of the transmittances of the individual path segments:\n$$\n\\tau_{2\\text{-way}} = \\tau_{\\text{out}} \\times \\tau_{\\text{in}}\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_{2\\text{-way}} = \\exp(-\\beta R) \\times \\exp(-\\beta R) = \\exp(-2\\beta R)\n$$\nThis is the required expression for the two-way atmospheric transmittance.\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- Extinction coefficient: $\\beta = 0.002 \\, \\mathrm{m}^{-1}$\n- Slant range: $R = 1 \\, \\mathrm{km}$\n\nFirst, we must ensure that the units are consistent. The extinction coefficient is in inverse meters, so the range must be converted to meters.\n$$\nR = 1 \\, \\mathrm{km} = 1000 \\, \\mathrm{m}\n$$\nNow, we can substitute these values into the expression for the two-way transmittance:\n$$\n\\tau_{2\\text{-way}} = \\exp(-2 \\beta R) = \\exp(-2 \\times 0.002 \\, \\mathrm{m}^{-1} \\times 1000 \\, \\mathrm{m})\n$$\nThe argument of the exponent is a dimensionless quantity:\n$$\n-2 \\times 0.002 \\times 1000 = -2 \\times 2 = -4\n$$\nSo, the two-way transmittance is:\n$$\n\\tau_{2\\text{-way}} = \\exp(-4)\n$$\nWe now evaluate this value and round to four significant figures:\n$$\n\\exp(-4) \\approx 0.0183156388...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we look at the fifth significant figure. The first four are $1$, $8$, $3$, $1$. The fifth is $5$, so we round up the last digit.\n$$\n\\tau_{2\\text{-way}} \\approx 0.01832\n$$",

Thus, $\\,\\rho_{R,ideal} - \\rho_{R,leaky} = -\\varepsilon(\\rho_L - \\rho_{R,ideal})\\,$.\nSubstituting this into the numerator gives $\\,2 \\rho_N (-\\varepsilon(\\rho_L - \\rho_{R,ideal})) = -2\\varepsilon \\rho_N (\\rho_L - \\rho_{R,ideal})\\,$.\nThe closed-form expression for the NDVI bias is:\n$$\\Delta \\mathrm{NDVI} = \\frac{-2\\varepsilon \\rho_N (\\rho_L - \\rho_{R,ideal})}{(\\rho_N + \\rho_{R,leaky})(\\rho_N + \\rho_{R,ideal})} = \\frac{-2\\varepsilon \\rho_N (\\rho_L - \\rho_{R,ideal})}{(\\rho_N + (1-\\varepsilon)\\rho_{R,ideal} + \\varepsilon \\rho_L)(\\rho_N + \\rho_{R,ideal})}$$\nThis is the second required expression.\n\nFinally, we evaluate $\\,\\Delta \\mathrm{NDVI}\\,$ numerically.\nGiven values are: $\\,\\varepsilon=0.02\\,$, $\\,\\rho_N=0.52\\,$, $\\,\\rho_{R,ideal}=0.06\\,$, and $\\,\\rho_L=0.58\\,$. We already calculated $\\,\\rho_{R,leaky} = 0.0704\\,$.\nWe can calculate the bias using the derived values:\n$$\\mathrm{NDVI}_{ideal} = \\frac{0.52 - 0.06}{0.52 + 0.06} = \\frac{0.46}{0.58} \\approx 0.7931034$$\n$$\\mathrm{NDVI}_{leaky} = \\frac{0.52 - 0.0704}{0.52 + 0.0704} = \\frac{0.4496}{0.5904} \\approx 0.7615176$$\n$$\\Delta \\mathrm{NDVI} = 0.7615176 - 0.7931034 = -0.0315858$$\nAlternatively, using the closed-form expression for the bias:\nNumerator: $\\,-2(0.02)(0.52)(0.58 - 0.06) = -0.04(0.52)(0.52) = -0.010816\\,$\nDenominator: $\\,(0.52 + 0.0704)(0.52 + 0.06) = (0.5904)(0.58) = 0.342432\\,$\n$$\\Delta \\mathrm{NDVI} = \\frac{-0.010816}{0.342432} \\approx -0.03158635$$\nThe small discrepancy is due to rounding in intermediate steps. The direct calculation from the formula is more precise. The problem asks for the magnitude of the bias, which is $\\,|\\Delta \\mathrm{NDVI}| \\approx 0.03158635\\,$.\nRounding to four significant figures gives $\\,0.03159\\,$.",
