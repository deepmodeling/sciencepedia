A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe objective is to derive the relationship between the spectral exitance, $M_{\\lambda}$, and the spectral radiance, $L_{\\lambda}$, for a Lambertian surface. We begin by establishing the roles of these two quantities based on their fundamental definitions.\n\nSpectral radiance, $L_{\\lambda}$, is a directional quantity. It describes the distribution of radiant power from a source with respect to both direction and position. As stated in the problem, its definition in differential form is the spectral power, $d\\Phi_{\\lambda}$ (power per unit wavelength), propagating into a specific differential solid angle, $d\\Omega$, from a differential source area, $dA$, as viewed from a direction $\\theta$ relative to the surface normal. The area is projected onto the plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation, which introduces the factor $\\cos\\theta$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$L_{\\lambda}(\\theta, \\phi) = \\frac{d^2\\Phi_{\\lambda}}{dA \\cos\\theta \\, d\\Omega}$$\nwhere $d^2\\Phi_{\\lambda}$ represents the portion of the spectral power $d\\Phi_{\\lambda}$ that is emitted from area $dA$ into solid angle $d\\Omega$. The units of $L_{\\lambda}$ are power per unit area, per unit solid angle, per unit wavelength (e.g., $\\text{W} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-2} \\cdot \\text{sr}^{-1} \\cdot \\mu\\text{m}^{-1}$).\n\nSpectral exitance, $M_{\\lambda}$, in contrast, is an integrated hemispherical quantity. It quantifies the total spectral power emitted per unit of physical surface area into the entire hemisphere of directions above the surface. Its definition is:\n$$M_{\\lambda} = \\frac{d\\Phi_{\\lambda}}{dA}$$\nwhere $d\\Phi_{\\lambda}$ is the total spectral power emitted from the area $dA$ integrated over all possible outward directions. The units of $M_{\\lambda}$ are power per unit area per unit wavelength (e.g., $\\text{W} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-2} \\cdot \\mu\\text{m}^{-1}$).\n\nThe role of $L_{\\lambda}$ is to specify the fundamental directional emission property of the surface, while the role of $M_{\\lambda}$ is to provide the total power flux density leaving the surface. The derivation connects these two quantities.\n\nTo find the total spectral power $d\\Phi_{\\lambda}$ emitted from area $dA$, we must integrate the differential spectral power $d^2\\Phi_{\\lambda}$ over the entire hemisphere ($\\Omega = 2\\pi$ steradians). We first rearrange the definition of radiance to solve for $d^2\\Phi_{\\lambda}$:\n$$d^2\\Phi_{\\lambda} = L_{\\lambda}(\\theta, \\phi) \\cos\\theta \\, dA \\, d\\Omega$$\nNow, we integrate this expression over the hemisphere of solid angles to obtain $d\\Phi_{\\lambda}$:\n$$d\\Phi_{\\lambda} = \\int_{\\text{hemisphere}} d^2\\Phi_{\\lambda} = \\int_{\\Omega=2\\pi} L_{\\lambda}(\\theta, \\phi) \\cos\\theta \\, dA \\, d\\Omega$$\nSince the surface area element $dA$ is not a function of the angular variables $\\theta$ and $\\phi$, we can factor it out of the integral:\n$$d\\Phi_{\\lambda} = dA \\int_{\\Omega=2\\pi} L_{\\lambda}(\\theta, \\phi) \\cos\\theta \\, d\\Omega$$\nBy substituting this into the definition for spectral exitance $M_{\\lambda}$, we get:\n$$M_{\\lambda} = \\frac{d\\Phi_{\\lambda}}{dA} = \\frac{dA \\int_{\\Omega=2\\pi} L_{\\lambda}(\\theta, \\phi) \\cos\\theta \\, d\\Omega}{dA}$$\n$$M_{\\lambda} = \\int_{\\Omega=2\\pi} L_{\\lambda}(\\theta, \\phi) \\cos\\theta \\, d\\Omega$$\nThis equation is the general relationship between spectral exitance and directional spectral radiance.\n\nTo evaluate the integral, we express the differential solid angle $d\\Omega$ in spherical coordinates. The solid angle element is given by $d\\Omega = \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi$. The integration over the hemisphere corresponds to the zenith angle $\\theta$ from $0$ to $\\pi/2$ and the azimuth angle $\\phi$ from $0$ to $2\\pi$.\n$$M_{\\lambda} = \\int_{\\phi=0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{\\theta=0}^{\\pi/2} L_{\\lambda}(\\theta, \\phi) \\cos\\theta \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi$$\nNow, we apply the crucial condition that the surface is Lambertian. This means the radiance is isotropic, i.e., constant with respect to direction: $L_{\\lambda}(\\theta, \\phi) = L_{\\lambda}$. As $L_{\\lambda}$ is a constant, it can be taken outside the integral:\n$$M_{\\lambda} = L_{\\lambda} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} \\cos\\theta \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi$$\nThe integral can be separated into two independent integrals over $\\phi$ and $\\theta$:\n$$M_{\\lambda} = L_{\\lambda} \\left( \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\right) \\left( \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta \\, d\\theta \\right)$$\nWe evaluate each integral separately. The integral over the azimuth angle is:\n$$\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\phi = [\\phi]_{0}^{2\\pi} = 2\\pi - 0 = 2\\pi$$\nThe integral over the zenith angle can be solved using the substitution $u = \\sin\\theta$, which implies $du = \\cos\\theta \\, d\\theta$. The limits of integration become $u(0) = \\sin(0) = 0$ and $u(\\pi/2) = \\sin(\\pi/2) = 1$.\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta \\, d\\theta = \\int_{0}^{1} u \\, du = \\left[ \\frac{u^2}{2} \\right]_{0}^{1} = \\frac{1^2}{2} - \\frac{0^2}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nSubstituting the results of these two integrals back into the expression for $M_{\\lambda}$:\n$$M_{\\lambda} = L_{\\lambda} \\cdot (2\\pi) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$$\nThis simplifies to the final expression:\n$$M_{\\lambda} = \\pi L_{\\lambda}$$\nThis result, often called the \"pi factor,\" is a fundamental consequence of integrating an isotropic radiance field over a hemisphere, correctly weighted by the projected area factor $\\cos\\theta$. For a Lambertian surface, the spectral exitance is simply $\\pi$ times the spectral radiance. The factor of $\\pi$ has units of steradians (sr), which reconciles the units of $L_{\\lambda}$ ($\\text{W} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-2} \\cdot \\text{sr}^{-1} \\cdot \\mu\\text{m}^{-1}$) and $M_{\\lambda}$ ($\\text{W} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-2} \\cdot \\mu\\text{m}^{-1}$).",

This corresponds to the second term in the expanded equation. Let us denote this term as $L_{\\lambda, \\text{refl-sky}}$.\n$$\nL_{\\lambda, \\text{refl-sky}} = \\tau_{\\lambda} (1 - \\epsilon_{\\lambda}) L_{\\lambda}^{\\downarrow}\n$$\nThis is the explicit expression for the reflected-sky correction term.\n\nThis term is non-negligible, particularly for low-emissivity surfaces, under specific conditions. Its magnitude is directly proportional to three factors: $\\tau_{\\lambda}$, $(1 - \\epsilon_{\\lambda})$, and $L_{\\lambda}^{\\downarrow}$.\n$1$. **Material Properties**: The term is proportional to the reflectance $\\rho_{\\lambda} = 1 - \\epsilon_{\\lambda}$. Therefore, it becomes significant for surfaces with low emissivity (and thus high reflectance). This includes materials like bare soils, sands (especially quartz-rich), and some types of rocks and minerals. For surfaces with emissivity close to unity, such as water or dense vegetation, this term is minimal.\n$2$. **Environmental Conditions (Atmosphere)**: The magnitude of the downwelling radiance, $L_{\\lambda}^{\\downarrow}$, is a critical factor. $L_{\\lambda}^{\\downarrow}$ is largest when the lower atmosphere is warm and contains significant quantities of greenhouse gases (primarily water vapor) or is cloudy. A low, warm cloud layer effectively acts as a blackbody at its base temperature, yielding a very high $L_{\\lambda}^{\\downarrow}$ and making the reflected component substantial. Conversely, under a clear, cold, and dry atmosphere, $L_{\\lambda}^{\\downarrow}$ is low, and the reflected term is less significant.\n$3$. **Viewing Conditions  Atmospheric Path**: The atmospheric transmissivity, $\\tau_{\\lambda}$, must be non-zero for the sensor to receive any signal from the surface. In atmospheric \"window\" regions, such as the $8-14\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ band, $\\tau_{\\lambda}$ is relatively high, allowing the reflected radiance to propagate to the sensor with less attenuation. Therefore, the reflected-sky term is most important for observations of low-emissivity surfaces through a transparent atmospheric window, especially when the near-surface atmosphere is warm, humid, or cloudy.\n\nFinally, we evaluate the magnitude of this term for the given conditions:\n$\\tau_{\\lambda} = 0.86$\n$\\epsilon_{\\lambda} = 0.65$\n$L_{\\lambda}^{\\downarrow} = 4.50\\,\\text{W m}^{-2}\\,\\text{sr}^{-1}\\,\\mu\\text{m}^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$\nL_{\\lambda, \\text{refl-sky}} = (0.86) \\times (1 - 0.65) \\times 4.50\n$$\n$$\nL_{\\lambda, \\text{refl-sky}} = (0.86) \\times (0.35) \\times 4.50\n$$\n$$\nL_{\\lambda, \\text{refl-sky}} = (0.301) \\times 4.50\n$$\n$$\nL_{\\lambda, \\text{refl-sky}} = 1.3545\\,\\text{W m}^{-2}\\,\\text{sr}^{-1}\\,\\mu\\text{m}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, as requested, gives $1.35$.",
