This first practice provides a foundational, system-level view of this challenge. Starting with the radiance from a terrestrial scene, you will trace the journey of photons through the instrument's optics to the detector, calculating the expected number of photoelectrons and deriving the fundamental signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) limited by the quantum nature of light itself, known as shot noise . This exercise is crucial for understanding how instrument design choices and observing conditions directly control the ultimate quality of the scientific data.",

            "problem": "A passive imaging spectroradiometer in a low-Earth-orbit remote sensing platform observes a spatially uniform terrestrial target in the visible band. The instrument has a circular entrance pupil of diameter $D = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{m}$, optical transmittance $\\tau = 0.60$, and a square pixel instantaneous field of view with side angular extent $\\theta = 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{rad}$ (small-angle approximation applies). The detector quantum efficiency is $\\eta = 0.90$, and the integration time is $t = 0.010\\,\\mathrm{s}$. The spectral band is centered at wavelength $\\lambda = 550\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ with a top-hat spectral response of width $\\Delta \\lambda = 50\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.

Use the following fundamental bases:\n- Photon energy is $E_{\\gamma} = \\dfrac{h c}{\\lambda}$, where $h$ is Planck’s constant and $c$ is the speed of light.\n- Spectral radiance $L_{\\lambda}$ relates to collected optical power through the etendue: the band-integrated power incident on the detector is the spectral radiance integrated over the instrument spectral band times the optical throughput $A \\Omega$ and the transmittance $\\tau$, where $A$ is the entrance pupil area and $\\Omega$ is the pixel solid angle.\n- For a counting process limited by photon shot noise, the variance of the detected photoelectron count equals its mean over the integration time.\n\nConstants: $h = 6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s}$, $c = 2.99792458 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$.\n\nTasks:\n1.

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard problem in remote sensing instrument performance analysis, providing all necessary information and relying on established physical principles. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is divided into two parts, as requested by the problem statement: first, the derivation of the symbolic expressions for the mean detected photoelectrons and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and second, the numerical evaluation of the SNR.\n\n**Part 1: Symbolic Derivations**\n\nOur goal is to derive an expression for the mean number of detected photoelectrons, $N$, and the corresponding signal-to-noise ratio, SNR, in the shot-noise-limited regime. We will build the expression step-by-step from the fundamental principles provided.\n\n1.  **Optical Power Incident on the Detector:**\n    The problem states that the spectral radiance, $L_{\\lambda}$, is constant over the spectral band of width $\\Delta \\lambda$. The band-integrated radiance, $L$, is thus the product of the spectral radiance and the spectral bandwidth:\n    $$L = L_{\\lambda} \\Delta \\lambda$$\n    The units of $L$ are $\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,sr^{-1}}$.\n    The optical power collected by the instrument's aperture and focused onto a single detector pixel is given by the product of the band-integrated radiance $L$ and the instrument's optical throughput, also known as etendue, $A \\Omega$. Here, $A$ is the area of the entrance pupil and $\\Omega$ is the solid angle subtended by a single pixel.\n    The entrance pupil is circular with diameter $D$, so its area is:\n    $$A = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}$$\n    The pixel has a square instantaneous field of view with side angular extent $\\theta$. Using the small-angle approximation, the solid angle of the pixel is:\n    $$\\Omega = \\theta^2$$\n    The power collected by the optics is $P_{\\text{collected}} = L A \\Omega$. This power is then attenuated by the optical system's transmittance, $\\tau$. The power incident on the detector, $P_{\\text{detector}}$, is therefore:\n    $$P_{\\text{detector}} = L A \\Omega \\tau = (L_{\\lambda} \\Delta \\lambda) A \\Omega \\tau$$\n\n2.  **Mean Number of Incident Photons:**\n    The energy of a single photon at the central wavelength $\\lambda$ is given by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n    $$E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$$\n    where $h$ is Planck's constant and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    The total energy incident on the detector over the integration time $t$ is $E_{\\text{total}} = P_{\\text{detector}} \\cdot t$. The mean number of photons, $N_{\\gamma}$, incident on the detector during this time is the total energy divided by the energy per photon:\n    $$N_{\\gamma} = \\frac{E_{\\text{total}}}{E_{\\gamma}} = \\frac{P_{\\text{detector}} \\cdot t}{hc/\\lambda} = \\frac{(L_{\\lambda} \\Delta \\lambda A \\Omega \\tau) t \\lambda}{hc}$$\n\n3.  **Mean Number of Detected Photoelectrons ($N$):**\n    The detector converts incident photons into photoelectrons with a quantum efficiency $\\eta$. The mean number of photoelectrons, $N$, generated during the integration time is:\n    $$N = \\eta N_{\\gamma}$$\n    Substituting the expression for $N_{\\gamma}$, we arrive at the desired expression for the mean detected photoelectrons in terms of the specified variables:\n    $$N = \\frac{\\eta L_{\\lambda} \\Delta \\lambda A \\Omega \\tau t \\lambda}{hc}$$\n    This expression can be expanded using the geometric definitions of $A$ and $\\Omega$:\n    $$N = \\frac{\\eta L_{\\lambda} \\Delta \\lambda \\left(\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\right) \\theta^2 \\tau t \\lambda}{hc}$$\n\n4.  **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR):**\n    The signal is defined as the mean number of detected photoelectrons, $S = N$.\n    The problem specifies that the only noise source is photon shot noise. For a Poisson process, which governs photon arrivals, the variance of the count is equal to its mean. Thus, the variance of the number of photoelectrons is $\\sigma_N^2 = N$.\n    The noise is the root-mean-square (RMS) deviation, which is the square root of the variance:\n    $$\\text{Noise} = \\sigma_N = \\sqrt{N}$$\n    The signal-to-noise ratio is the ratio of the signal to the noise:\n    $$\\text{SNR} = \\frac{S}{\\text{Noise}} = \\frac{N}{\\sqrt{N}} = \\sqrt{N}$$\n    Substituting the full expression for $N$, we obtain the closed-form expression for the SNR:\n    $$\\text{SNR} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\eta L_{\\lambda} \\Delta \\lambda A \\Omega \\tau t \\lambda}{hc}}$$\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe now substitute the provided numerical values to evaluate the SNR. It is critical to maintain consistent units (SI base units).\n\nThe given parameters are:\n-   Spectral radiance: $L_{\\lambda} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,sr^{-1}\\,nm^{-1}}$\n-   Spectral bandwidth: $\\Delta \\lambda = 50\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\n-   Entrance pupil diameter: $D = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n-   Pixel angular extent: $\\theta = 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{rad} = 50 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{rad}$\n-   Optical transmittance: $\\tau = 0.60$\n-   Integration time: $t = 0.010\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n-   Center wavelength: $\\lambda = 550\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 550 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n-   Quantum efficiency: $\\eta = 0.90$\n-   Planck's constant: $h = 6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s}$\n-   Speed of light: $c = 2.99792458 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the intermediate quantities:\n-   Band-integrated radiance $L = L_{\\lambda} \\Delta \\lambda$:\n    $$L = (2.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,sr^{-1}\\,nm^{-1}}) \\times (50\\,\\mathrm{nm}) = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,sr^{-1}}$$\n-   Entrance pupil area $A$:\n    $$A = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4} = \\frac{\\pi (0.10\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}{4} \\approx 7.854 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m^2}$$\n-   Pixel solid angle $\\Omega$:\n    $$\\Omega = \\theta^2 = (50 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{rad})^2 = 2.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{sr}$$\n-   Product of Planck's constant and the speed of light:\n    $$hc = (6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s}) \\times (2.99792458 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}) \\approx 1.9864 \\times 10^{-25}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,m}$$\n\nNow, we compute the mean number of photoelectrons, $N$, by substituting all values into the full expression:\n$$N = \\frac{0.90 \\times 1.0 \\times (\\frac{\\pi(0.10)^2}{4}) \\times (50 \\times 10^{-6})^2 \\times 0.60 \\times 0.010 \\times (550 \\times 10^{-9})}{6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34} \\times 2.99792458 \\times 10^{8}}$$\n$$N \\approx 293564$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the signal-to-noise ratio:\n$$\\text{SNR} = \\sqrt{N} \\approx \\sqrt{293564} \\approx 541.815$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$\\text{SNR} \\approx 542$$\nThis is a robust SNR value, expected for a reasonably bright target observed by a well-designed instrument under shot-noise-limited conditions.",
