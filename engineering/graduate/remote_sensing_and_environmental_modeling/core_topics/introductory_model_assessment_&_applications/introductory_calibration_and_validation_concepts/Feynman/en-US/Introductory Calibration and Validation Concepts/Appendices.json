            "problem": "A satellite imaging spectrometer produces raw digital counts $D$ that are converted to at-sensor radiance $L$ through an instrument transfer function $f$ linking $D$ to $L$. For smooth $f$, a second-order Taylor expansion about $D=0$ provides a working calibration model where the leading terms are an offset $o = f(0)$, a linear gain $g = f'(0)$, and a quadratic nonlinearity coefficient $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2} f''(0)$, yielding a calibration mapping that includes a small nonlinearity. In laboratory characterization, the following parameters were estimated: a linear gain $g = 2.4 \\times 10^{-5}$ watt per square meter per steradian per count, an offset $o = 1.2 \\times 10^{-3}$ watt per square meter per steradian, and a quadratic coefficient $\\alpha = -1.1 \\times 10^{-10}$ watt per square meter per steradian per count squared. Consider a pixel whose raw counts are $D = 38500$, and a sensor dynamic range defined on $D \\in [0, D_{\\max}]$ with $D_{\\max} = 65535$. Starting from the second-order Taylor expansion model and the definition of monotonicity for a differentiable mapping, derive the calibrated at-sensor radiance $L(D)$ and the condition under which the calibration mapping is monotonically increasing over $[0, D_{\\max}]$. Compute the calibrated radiance for the given $D$, and then compute the minimum slope $m = \\min_{D \\in [0, D_{\\max}]} \\frac{dL}{dD}$ to assess whether monotonicity is preserved. Provide as your final answer the value of $m$ in watt per square meter per steradian per count. Round your final answer to four significant figures. Express $L$ in watt per square meter per steradian and $m$ in watt per square meter per steradian per count.",
            "solution": "The problem provides a second-order Taylor expansion as a model for a satellite sensor's calibration. The at-sensor radiance $L$ is related to the raw digital counts $D$ by a function $L = f(D)$. The model is an approximation of this function around $D=0$:\n$$L(D) \\approx f(0) + f'(0)D + \\frac{f''(0)}{2!}D^2$$\nThe problem defines the coefficients in terms of physical parameters: the offset $o = f(0)$, the linear gain $g = f'(0)$, and the quadratic nonlinearity coefficient $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}f''(0)$. Substituting these definitions into the expansion gives the explicit calibration model:\n$$L(D) = o + gD + \\alpha D^2$$\nThis is the required expression for the calibrated at-sensor radiance $L(D)$.\n\nNext, we derive the condition for the calibration mapping to be monotonically increasing. A differentiable function is monotonically increasing on an interval if its first derivative is non-negative everywhere in that interval. The domain of interest is the sensor's dynamic range, given as $D \\in [0, D_{\\max}]$. We calculate the first derivative of $L(D)$ with respect to $D$:\n$$\\frac{dL}{dD} = \\frac{d}{dD}(o + gD + \\alpha D^2) = g + 2\\alpha D$$\nThe condition for monotonicity is that $\\frac{dL}{dD} \\ge 0$ for all $D \\in [0, D_{\\max}]$. The derivative is a linear function of $D$ with a slope of $2\\alpha$. The value of $\\alpha$ is given as $-1.1 \\times 10^{-10}$ watt per square meter per steradian per count squared, which is negative. Therefore, the function $\\frac{dL}{dD}$ is a decreasing function of $D$. For a decreasing function on a closed interval, the minimum value is achieved at the right endpoint of the interval. Thus, the condition $\\frac{dL}{dD} \\ge 0$ will hold for the entire interval if and only if it holds at $D = D_{\\max}$. The condition for the calibration mapping to be monotonically increasing over $[0, D_{\\max}]$ is therefore:\n$$g + 2\\alpha D_{\\max} \\ge 0$$\nNow, we compute the calibrated radiance for a pixel with raw counts $D = 38500$. The given parameters are:\n$o = 1.2 \\times 10^{-3}$ W m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$\n$g = 2.4 \\times 10^{-5}$ W m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ count$^{-1}$\n$\\alpha = -1.1 \\times 10^{-10}$ W m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ count$^{-2}$\nPlugging these values and $D = 38500$ into the calibration equation:\n$$L(38500) = (1.2 \\times 10^{-3}) + (2.4 \\times 10^{-5})(38500) + (-1.1 \\times 10^{-10})(38500)^2$$\nWe evaluate the terms:\n$$(2.4 \\times 10^{-5})(38500) = 0.924$$\n$$(-1.1 \\times 10^{-10})(38500)^2 = (-1.1 \\times 10^{-10})(1482250000) \\approx -0.1630475$$\n$$L(38500) \\approx 1.2 \\times 10^{-3} + 0.924 - 0.1630475 = 0.0012 + 0.924 - 0.1630475 = 0.7621525$$\nSo, the calibrated radiance is approximately $0.7621525$ W m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$.\n\nFinally, we are asked to compute the minimum slope $m = \\min_{D \\in [0, D_{\\max}]} \\frac{dL}{dD}$. As established from the monotonicity analysis, the slope $\\frac{dL}{dD} = g + 2\\alpha D$ is a decreasing function of $D$ because $\\alpha < 0$. Therefore, its minimum value over the interval $[0, D_{\\max}]$ occurs at $D = D_{\\max}$.\n$$m = g + 2\\alpha D_{\\max}$$\nWe substitute the given values, with $D_{\\max} = 65535$:\n$$m = (2.4 \\times 10^{-5}) + 2(-1.1 \\times 10^{-10})(65535)$$\n$$m = 2.4 \\times 10^{-5} - (2.2 \\times 10^{-10})(65535)$$\n$$m = 2.4 \\times 10^{-5} - 0.0000144177$$\n$$m = 2.4 \\times 10^{-5} - 1.44177 \\times 10^{-5}$$\n$$m = (2.4 - 1.44177) \\times 10^{-5}$$\n$$m = 0.95823 \\times 10^{-5} = 9.5823 \\times 10^{-6}$$\nThe units of $m$ are W m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ count$^{-1}$.

The coefficient of determination, $R^2$, measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). In this context, an $R^2$ of $0.9994$ indicates an extremely strong linear relationship between the calibrated measurements ($L_{\\text{cal}}$) and the reference radiances ($L_{\\text{ref}}$). This means the sensor response is highly linear and predictable.\n\nHowever, $R^2$ is insensitive to additive and multiplicative biases. Good calibration quality requires both high precision (low random error) and high accuracy (low systematic error). Our calculated bias of $0.2333$ W m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ $\\mu$m$^{-1}$ reveals a systematic error: the calibrated measurements are, on average, higher than the true reference values. The RMSE of $0.2485$ W m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ $\\mu$m$^{-1}$ quantifies the total error, which is dominated by this systematic bias. While the relationship is linear (high $R^2$), the data do not fall on the ideal $1:1$ line but rather on a line with a positive offset. Therefore, despite the excellent $R^2$, the calibration is not perfect and exhibits a clear accuracy problem (a positive bias) that needs correction.",
