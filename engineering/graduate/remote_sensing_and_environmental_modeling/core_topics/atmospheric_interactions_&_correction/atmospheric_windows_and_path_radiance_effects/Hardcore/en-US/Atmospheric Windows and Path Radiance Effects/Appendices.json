            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the atmospheric transmittance along a vertical path from the surface to the top of the atmosphere at a wavelength of $\\lambda = 0.86\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. The solution starts from the Beer–Lambert law, which relates transmittance $T$ to the optical depth $\\tau$ of the medium.\n\nThe Beer–Lambert law is given by:\n$$T = \\exp(-\\tau)$$\nwhere $T$ is the transmittance, a unitless quantity, and $\\tau$ is the optical depth, also unitless.\n\nThe problem simplifies the atmosphere to a homogeneous path of effective length $L = 8.0 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$ with effective number densities for the absorbing gases.

An atmospheric window is a spectral region where the atmosphere is highly transparent, allowing radiation from the surface to travel to a satellite sensor with minimal attenuation and contamination. This requires both high transmittance (low absorption) and low scattering.\n\nOur calculation shows a total atmospheric transmittance of approximately $0.951$ due to absorption by key gases. This value is very close to $1$, indicating that about $95.1\\%$ of the surface radiation passes through the atmosphere without being absorbed. The total absorption is only about $1 - 0.951 = 0.049$, or $4.9\\%$. This signifies very low absorption.\n\nThe problem also requires consideration of path radiance, which arises from atmospheric scattering. We must consider both molecular (Rayleigh) and aerosol (Mie) scattering.\n-   **Rayleigh Scattering**: The efficiency of Rayleigh scattering is strongly dependent on wavelength, varying as $\\lambda^{-4}$. The wavelength $\\lambda = 0.86\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ is in the near-infrared part of the spectrum. Compared to the visible spectrum (e.g., blue light at $\\lambda \\approx 0.45\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$), Rayleigh scattering at $0.86\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ is significantly weaker. This weakness means that the contribution of molecular scattering to both total extinction and path radiance is small.\n-   **Aerosol Scattering**: The effect of aerosols is more variable, depending on their concentration and physical properties. However, under typical, non-hazy atmospheric conditions, aerosol scattering in the near-infrared is also relatively low.\n\nGiven that both absorption and scattering are low at $\\lambda = 0.86\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, the atmosphere is highly transparent. This ensures that the signal measured by the nadir-viewing satellite is dominated by radiation reflected from the land surface, rather than being attenuated by absorption or contaminated by path radiance. Therefore, the $0.86\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ interval indeed qualifies as a valuable atmospheric window for remote sensing applications, such as monitoring vegetation health, where surface reflectance retrieval is the primary objective.",

The expression for the apparent reflectance at the center of the lake becomes:\n$$\\rho_{\\text{app}}(\\boldsymbol{0}) = (1-\\eta) \\rho_d + \\eta \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^2} \\rho(\\boldsymbol{x}') G(\\boldsymbol{x}') \\, \\mathrm{d}^2\\boldsymbol{x}'$$\nWe split the integral over the two regions (lake and surrounding land):\n$$\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^2} \\rho(\\boldsymbol{x}') G(\\boldsymbol{x}') \\, \\mathrm{d}^2\\boldsymbol{x}' = \\int_{\\|\\boldsymbol{x}'\\| \\le a} \\rho_d G(\\boldsymbol{x}') \\, \\mathrm{d}^2\\boldsymbol{x}' + \\int_{\\|\\boldsymbol{x}'\\| > a} \\rho_b G(\\boldsymbol{x}') \\, \\mathrm{d}^2\\boldsymbol{x}'$$\n$$ = \\rho_d \\int_{\\|\\boldsymbol{x}'\\| \\le a} G(\\boldsymbol{x}') \\, \\mathrm{d}^2\\boldsymbol{x}' + \\rho_b \\int_{\\|\\boldsymbol{x}'\\| > a} G(\\boldsymbol{x}') \\, \\mathrm{d}^2\\boldsymbol{x}'$$\nLet us define $I_a = \\int_{\\|\\boldsymbol{x}'\\| \\le a} G(\\boldsymbol{x}') \\, \\mathrm{d}^2\\boldsymbol{x}'$, which is the fraction of the PSF's energy contained within a disk of radius $a$. Since the PSF is normalized such that $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^2} G(\\boldsymbol{x}')\\,\\mathrm{d}^2\\boldsymbol{x}' = 1$, the integral over the surrounding land is $\\int_{\\|\\boldsymbol{x}'\\| > a} G(\\boldsymbol{x}') \\, \\mathrm{d}^2\\boldsymbol{x}' = 1 - I_a$.\nThe convolution integral evaluates to $\\rho_d I_a + \\rho_b(1-I_a)$.\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\rho_{\\text{app}}(\\boldsymbol{0})$:\n$$\\rho_{\\text{app}}(\\boldsymbol{0}) = (1-\\eta) \\rho_d + \\eta [\\rho_d I_a + \\rho_b(1-I_a)]$$\n$$\\rho_{\\text{app}}(\\boldsymbol{0}) = \\rho_d - \\eta \\rho_d + \\eta \\rho_d I_a + \\eta \\rho_b (1-I_a)$$\n$$\\rho_{\\text{app}}(\\boldsymbol{0}) = \\rho_d - \\eta \\rho_d (1-I_a) + \\eta \\rho_b (1-I_a)$$\n$$\\rho_{\\text{app}}(\\boldsymbol{0}) = \\rho_d + (\\rho_b - \\rho_d) \\eta (1-I_a)$$\n\nThe reflectance error is $\\Delta \\rho = \\rho_{\\text{app}}(\\boldsymbol{0}) - \\rho_d$. From the above expression, we find:\n$$\\Delta \\rho = (\\rho_b - \\rho_d) \\eta (1-I_a)$$\n\nNow, we must compute $I_a$ for the given Gaussian PSF, $G(r) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi s^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r^2}{2s^2}\\right)$. We switch to polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, where $\\mathrm{d}^2\\boldsymbol{x}' = r\\,\\mathrm{d}r\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta$.\n$$I_a = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^a \\frac{1}{2\\pi s^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r^2}{2s^2}\\right) r\\,\\mathrm{d}r\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta$$\nThe integrand is independent of $\\theta$, so the angular integration yields a factor of $2\\pi$:\n$$I_a = \\frac{2\\pi}{2\\pi s^2} \\int_0^a r \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r^2}{2s^2}\\right) \\mathrm{d}r = \\frac{1}{s^2} \\int_0^a r \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r^2}{2s^2}\\right) \\mathrm{d}r$$\nUsing the substitution $u = \\frac{r^2}{2s^2}$, we have $\\mathrm{d}u = \\frac{r}{s^2}\\mathrm{d}r$. The limits of integration become $u=0$ for $r=0$, and $u = \\frac{a^2}{2s^2}$ for $r=a$.\n$$I_a = \\int_0^{a^2/(2s^2)} \\exp(-u) \\, \\mathrm{d}u = \\left[-\\exp(-u)\\right]_0^{a^2/(2s^2)} = -\\exp\\left(-\\frac{a^2}{2s^2}\\right) - (-\\exp(0))$$\n$$I_a = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{a^2}{2s^2}\\right)$$\nTherefore, the term $(1-I_a)$ in the error expression simplifies to:\n$$1 - I_a = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{a^2}{2s^2}\\right)$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\Delta\\rho$:\n$$\\Delta \\rho = (\\rho_b - \\rho_d) \\eta \\exp\\left(-\\frac{a^2}{2s^2}\\right)$$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the reflectance error.\n\nFinally, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$\\rho_d = 0.02$\n$\\rho_b = 0.36$\n$\\eta = 0.20$\n$a = 20\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$s = 40\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n\nFirst, calculate the exponent:\n$$\\frac{a^2}{2s^2} = \\frac{(20)^2}{2(40)^2} = \\frac{400}{2(1600)} = \\frac{400}{3200} = \\frac{1}{8} = 0.125$$\nNext, calculate the reflectance difference:\n$$\\rho_b - \\rho_d = 0.36 - 0.02 = 0.34$$\nNow, compute $\\Delta \\rho$:\n$$\\Delta \\rho = (0.34) (0.20) \\exp(-0.125)$$\n$$\\Delta \\rho = 0.068 \\exp(-0.125)$$\nUsing a calculator, $\\exp(-0.125) \\approx 0.8824969025...$\n$$\\Delta \\rho \\approx 0.068 \\times 0.8824969025 \\approx 0.06000978937$$\nRounding to four significant figures, as requested:\n$$\\Delta \\rho \\approx 0.06001$$\n\nThe error is positive, which is expected since the dark target ($\\rho_d=0.02$) is surrounded by a much brighter surface ($\\rho_b=0.36$), causing scattered light from the surroundings to erroneously increase the apparent radiance and hence the retrieved reflectance of the target.",
