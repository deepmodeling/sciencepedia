            "problem": "A multispectral satellite sensor measures top-of-canopy spectral reflectance of a vegetated pixel at four band centers in the red and near-infrared region: $670$ nanometers, $700$ nanometers, $740$ nanometers, and $780$ nanometers. Let the corresponding atmospherically corrected reflectances be denoted by $R_{670}$, $R_{700}$, $R_{740}$, and $R_{780}$, respectively, where each $R_{\\lambda}$ represents the band-center approximation to the continuous top-of-canopy reflectance function $R(\\lambda)$. In the red edge region, vegetation spectra typically exhibit a monotonic increase in reflectance transitioning from the red absorption to the near-infrared plateau due to chlorophyll absorption and internal leaf scattering, and it is empirically observed that the segment between $700$ nanometers and $740$ nanometers is often approximately linear for healthy canopies.\n\nDefine the Red Edge Position (REP) as the wavelength $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{REP}}$ at which the reflectance equals the arithmetic mean of the reflectances measured at $670$ nanometers and $780$ nanometers, i.e., the wavelength satisfying $R(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{REP}}) = \\frac{R_{670} + R_{780}}{2}$ with $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{REP}} \\in [700, 740]$ nanometers.

It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, or ill-posed. It is a standard analytical problem within its scientific domain.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe core of this problem rests upon the assumption that the spectral reflectance function, $R(\\lambda)$, is linear on the interval $[\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2]$, where $\\lambda_1 = 700$ nm and $\\lambda_2 = 740$ nm. The corresponding reflectances at these wavelengths are $R(\\lambda_1) = R_{700}$ and $R(\\lambda_2) = R_{740}$.\n\nWe can express the linear relationship for any wavelength $\\lambda$ within this interval using the two-point form of a line equation. This form is particularly suitable for interpolation. For two points $(\\lambda_1, R_1)$ and $(\\lambda_2, R_2)$, the equation is:\n$$R(\\lambda) = R_1 + (\\lambda - \\lambda_1) \\frac{R_2 - R_1}{\\lambda_2 - \\lambda_1}$$\nSubstituting our specific points $(\\lambda, R(\\lambda)) = (700, R_{700})$ and $(\\lambda, R(\\lambda)) = (740, R_{740})$, the equation for the reflectance in the specified interval becomes:\n$$R(\\lambda) = R_{700} + (\\lambda - 700) \\frac{R_{740} - R_{700}}{740 - 700}$$\nThe denominator simplifies to $40$:\n$$R(\\lambda) = R_{700} + (\\lambda - 700) \\frac{R_{740} - R_{700}}{40}$$\nThe problem defines the Red Edge Position, $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{REP}}$, as the wavelength at which the reflectance $R(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{REP}})$ is equal to a specific value, which we will denote $R_{\\mathrm{target}}$. This target reflectance is defined as the arithmetic mean of the reflectances at $670$ nm and $780$ nm:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{target}} = \\frac{R_{670} + R_{780}}{2}$$\nTo find $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{REP}}$, we set $R(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{REP}}) = R_{\\mathrm{target}}$ in our linear model. Since the problem states that $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{REP}} \\in [700, 740]$, our linear model is applicable.\n$$\\frac{R_{670} + R_{780}}{2} = R_{700} + (\\lambda_{\\mathrm{REP}} - 700) \\frac{R_{740} - R_{700}}{40}$$\nWe must now solve this equation for $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{REP}}$. First, we isolate the term containing $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{REP}}$ by subtracting $R_{700}$ from both sides:\n$$\\frac{R_{670} + R_{780}}{2} - R_{700} = (\\lambda_{\\mathrm{REP}} - 700) \\frac{R_{740} - R_{700}}{40}$$\nTo simplify the left side, we find a common denominator:\n$$\\frac{R_{670} + R_{780} - 2R_{700}}{2} = (\\lambda_{\\mathrm{REP}} - 700) \\frac{R_{740} - R_{700}}{40}$$\nNext, we isolate the $(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{REP}} - 700)$ term by multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of the slope term, which is $\\frac{40}{R_{740} - R_{700}}$:\n$$\\lambda_{\\mathrm{REP}} - 700 = \\left( \\frac{R_{670} + R_{780} - 2R_{700}}{2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{40}{R_{740} - R_{700}} \\right)$$\nSimplifying the numerical constants ($40/2 = 20$):\n$$\\lambda_{\\mathrm{REP}} - 700 = 20 \\left( \\frac{R_{670} + R_{780} - 2R_{700}}{R_{740} - R_{700}} \\right)$$\nFinally, we obtain the closed-form expression for $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{REP}}$ by adding $700$ to both sides of the equation:\n$$\\lambda_{\\mathrm{REP}} = 700 + 20 \\frac{R_{670} + R_{780} - 2R_{700}}{R_{740} - R_{700}}$$\nThis expression gives the Red Edge Position in nanometers, based on the four reflectance measurements and the assumed linear behavior of the spectrum between $700$ nm and $740$ nm. It is derived directly from the principle of linear interpolation.",

All parameters are specified with realistic values and units. The definitions for the two metrics, REP and CR center, are precise and computationally tractable. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\n\nThe analysis will proceed in three stages:\n1.  Determination of the continuous-location tendencies of the two metrics.\n2.  Quantification of the discrete, noiseless estimates for REP and CR center.\n3.  Analysis of the effects of sampling and noise.\n\n**1. Continuous-Location Tendencies**\n\nThe derivative-based REP, in its continuous form, corresponds to the wavelength $\\lambda$ at which the first derivative of the reflectance, $R'(\\lambda)$, is maximum. This derivative is $R'(\\lambda) = S'(\\lambda) + G'(\\lambda)$.\n- The derivative of the logistic function $S(\\lambda)$ is $S'(\\lambda) = \\frac{A}{k} \\frac{\\exp(-(\\lambda - \\lambda_0)/k)}{(1 + \\exp(-(\\lambda - \\lambda_0)/k))^2}$. This function is symmetric and has its maximum at $\\lambda = \\lambda_0 = 705\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. This is the inflection point of the red edge.\n- The derivative of the Gaussian absorption feature $G(\\lambda)$ is $G'(\\lambda) = \\frac{C(\\lambda - \\lambda_a)}{\\sigma^2} \\exp(-\\frac{(\\lambda - \\lambda_a)^2}{2\\sigma^2})$. This is a bipolar function that is negative for $\\lambda < \\lambda_a$ and positive for $\\lambda > \\lambda_a$. It has a minor influence on the location of the peak of $R'(\\lambda)$, which is dominated by the much larger slope of $S'(\\lambda)$. Specifically, around $\\lambda_0 = 705\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, the term $\\lambda - \\lambda_a = 25\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, so $G'(705\\,\\mathrm{nm})$ is a small positive value that is decreasing. This will pull the peak of the total derivative $R'(\\lambda)$ to a wavelength slightly lower than $\\lambda_0 = 705\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n- Therefore, the continuous REP is expected to be very close to, but slightly less than, $705\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nThe continuum-removed feature center, in its continuous form, seeks the minimum of $r(\\lambda) = R(\\lambda)/C(\\lambda)$. Conceptually, continuum removal is designed to isolate absorption features from the smoothly varying background. The minimum of $r(\\lambda)$ will therefore correspond closely to the wavelength of maximum absorption, which is the center of the negative Gaussian feature $G(\\lambda)$.\n- The maximum absorption (minimum value of $G(\\lambda)$) occurs at $\\lambda = \\lambda_a = 680\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n- Therefore, the continuous CR center is expected to be located at or very near $680\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nThe two metrics are fundamentally designed to measure different spectral characteristics: the REP targets the inflection point of the red-to-NIR transition slope, while the CR center targets the point of maximum pigment absorption.\n\n**2. Discrete, Noiseless Estimates**\n\nWe will now compute the values for the two metrics based on the discrete sampling grid ($\\Delta\\lambda = 10\\,\\mathrm{nm}$).\n\n**Derivative-based REP:**\nThe sampled wavelengths are $\\lambda_i = 650, 660, 670, \\dots, 800\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. We must compute $D_i = (R(\\lambda_{i+1}) - R(\\lambda_i))/10$ for $\\lambda_i$ from $660\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ to $750\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and find the maximum.\n\nLet's compute $R(\\lambda) = 0.05 + \\frac{0.45}{1 + \\exp(-(\\lambda - 705)/8)} - 0.05 \\exp(-(\\lambda - 680)^2/50)$ at the relevant wavelengths:\n- $R(680) \\approx 0.05 + 0.0190 - 0.05 = 0.0190$\n- $R(690) \\approx 0.05 + 0.0690 - 0.0068 = 0.1122$\n- $R(700) \\approx 0.05 + 0.1568 - 0.00002 = 0.2068$\n- $R(710) \\approx 0.05 + 0.2932 - 0 \\approx 0.3432$\n- $R(720) \\approx 0.05 + 0.3903 - 0 \\approx 0.4403$\n\nNow, we compute the slopes $D_i$:\n- $D_{680} = (R(690) - R(680))/10 = (0.1122 - 0.0190)/10 = 0.00932$\n- $D_{690} = (R(700) - R(690))/10 = (0.2068 - 0.1122)/10 = 0.00946$\n- $D_{700} = (R(710) - R(700))/10 = (0.3432 - 0.2068)/10 = 0.01364$\n- $D_{710} = (R(720) - R(710))/10 = (0.4403 - 0.3432)/10 = 0.00971$\n\nThe maximum slope is $D_{700} = 0.01364$, which corresponds to the wavelength interval $[\\lambda_i, \\lambda_{i+1}] = [700\\,\\mathrm{nm}, 710\\,\\mathrm{nm}]$. The REP is the midpoint of this interval:\nREP $= \\frac{700 + 710}{2} = 705\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n\n**Continuum-Removed Center (CR center):**\nFirst, we define the linear continuum $C(\\lambda)$ between $(\\lambda_L, R(\\lambda_L))$ and $(\\lambda_R, R(\\lambda_R))$, where $\\lambda_L=660\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and $\\lambda_R=750\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n- $R(660) \\approx 0.05 + 0.0016 - 0.00002 = 0.0516$\n- $R(750) \\approx 0.05 + 0.4484 - 0 = 0.4984$\nThe equation for the continuum is $C(\\lambda) = R(660) + \\frac{R(750) - R(660)}{750 - 660}(\\lambda - 660)$.\n$C(\\lambda) \\approx 0.0516 + \\frac{0.4468}{90}(\\lambda - 660)$.\n\nNext, we compute $r(\\lambda_i) = R(\\lambda_i)/C(\\lambda_i)$ for $\\lambda_i \\in [660, 700]\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n- $\\lambda_i=660: C(660) = R(660)$, so $r(660) = 1.0$.\n- $\\lambda_i=670: R(670) \\approx 0.05 + 0.0056 - 0.0068 = 0.0488$. $C(670) \\approx 0.0516 + \\frac{0.4468}{90}(10) \\approx 0.1013$. $r(670) \\approx 0.0488 / 0.1013 \\approx 0.482$.\n- $\\lambda_i=680: R(680) \\approx 0.0190$. $C(680) \\approx 0.0516 + \\frac{0.4468}{90}(20) \\approx 0.1509$. $r(680) \\approx 0.0190 / 0.1509 \\approx 0.126$.\n- $\\lambda_i=690: R(690) \\approx 0.1122$. $C(690) \\approx 0.0516 + \\frac{0.4468}{90}(30) \\approx 0.2005$. $r(690) \\approx 0.1122 / 0.2005 \\approx 0.560$.\n- $\\lambda_i=700: R(700) \\approx 0.2068$. $C(700) \\approx 0.0516 + \\frac{0.4468}{90}(40) \\approx 0.2501$. $r(700) \\approx 0.2068 / 2501 \\approx 0.827$.\n\nThe minimum value of $r(\\lambda_i)$ occurs at $\\lambda_i = 680\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\nCR center $= 680\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nSummary of noiseless estimates: REP is $705\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and CR center is $680\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. The metrics diverge significantly.\n\n**3. Effects of Sampling and Noise**\n\n- **Derivative-based REP:** The REP is calculated from the first difference, $D_i$. With additive noise $\\varepsilon_i$, the measured slope is $D_{m,i} = D_i + (\\varepsilon_{i+1}-\\varepsilon_i)/\\Delta\\lambda$. The variance of the noise on the slope is $\\mathrm{Var}((\\varepsilon_{i+1}-\\varepsilon_i)/\\Delta\\lambda) = (\\sigma_n^2+\\sigma_n^2)/(\\Delta\\lambda)^2 = 2\\sigma_n^2/(\\Delta\\lambda)^2$. This shows that the differentiation operation amplifies the noise, and this amplification is more severe for finer spectral sampling (smaller $\\Delta\\lambda$). Finding the maximum of a noisy derivative sequence can be unstable. Furthermore, the coarse sampling of $\\Delta\\lambda=10\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ quantizes the possible REP values to midpoints of the sampling intervals (e.g., $695, 705, 715\\,\\mathrm{nm}$), which can introduce error if the true peak is not near one of these discrete values.\n\n- **CR Center:** This metric involves a ratio, $r_m(\\lambda_i) = R_m(\\lambda_i)/C_m(\\lambda_i)$. The noise in the numerator is $\\varepsilon_i$, and the noise in the denominator $C_m(\\lambda_i)$ is a linear combination of the noise at the continuum endpoints, $\\varepsilon_L$ and $\\varepsilon_R$. While noise is propagated through the ratio, the signal—the depth of the absorption feature—is often strong enough to make the position of the minimum robust. In our case, the minimum $r(680)\\approx 0.126$ is significantly smaller than its neighbors ($r(670)\\approx 0.482, r(690)\\approx 0.560$). The noise level $\\sigma_n=0.005$ is unlikely to cause the minimum to shift to an adjacent band. Similar to REP, the CR center estimate is also quantized to the discrete sample wavelengths ($\\dots, 670, 680, 690, \\dots$).\n\n**Conclusion on Stability:** The derivative-based REP is generally considered more susceptible to noise and artifacts from coarse sampling (quantization) than the CR Center, as differentiation inherently amplifies high-frequency noise.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A) Under the provided spectrum with $\\lambda_0 \\approx 705\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and a chlorophyll absorption centered near $\\lambda_a \\approx 680\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, the derivative-based REP computed from $\\Delta\\lambda = 10\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ bands is approximately $705\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, while the continuum-removed feature center is approximately $680\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. Divergence arises because REP targets the red edge inflection linked to internal scattering, whereas the CR center targets the absorption center linked to pigment content; moreover, differentiation amplifies noise and band quantization, making REP more sensitive to coarse sampling than the CR center.**\n\n- The numerical estimates (REP $\\approx 705\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, CR center $\\approx 680\\,\\mathrm{nm}$) are in exact agreement with the derivation.\n- The physical explanation for the divergence (REP tied to inflection point/scattering, CR center tied to absorption minimum/pigment) is correct.\n- The statistical/sampling analysis (differentiation amplifies noise, REP sensitivity to quantization) is correct.\n- **Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B) Both metrics identify the same wavelength near $690\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ because both are controlled primarily by chlorophyll absorption; continuum removal eliminates any divergence, and differentiation suppresses noise so sampling and noise do not cause bias.**\n\n- \"Both metrics identify the same wavelength near $690\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\": This is false; the calculated values are $705\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and $680\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n- \"both are controlled primarily by chlorophyll absorption\": This is false; REP is primarily controlled by the red edge slope ($S(\\lambda)$ component).\n- \"differentiation suppresses noise\": This is fundamentally false; differentiation amplifies high-frequency noise.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C) The derivative-based REP aligns with the continuum-removed center at $680\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ under $\\Delta\\lambda = 10\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ sampling, and any divergence occurs only due to atmospheric absorption features; sensor noise cancels out in both the ratio and difference operations, so it has negligible influence.**\n\n- \"REP aligns with the continuum-removed center at $680\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\": This is false; the REP is calculated to be $705\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n- \"divergence occurs only due to atmospheric absorption features\": This is false; the divergence is inherent to the definitions of the metrics and the spectrum's shape. No atmosphere is included in the model.\n- \"sensor noise cancels out\": This is false. The variance of a difference of independent random variables is the sum of their variances, not zero.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D) Under $\\Delta\\lambda = 10\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ sampling, the derivative-based REP is biased low toward $690\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ because finite differences underestimate steep slopes, while the continuum-removed feature center is biased high toward $700\\,\\mathrm{nm}$; divergence is primarily due to continuum removal amplifying noise more than differentiation.**\n\n- \"REP is biased low toward $690\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\": This is false; the calculation yields $705\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n- \"continuum-removed feature center is biased high toward $700\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\": This is false; the calculation yields $680\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n- \"continuum removal amplifying noise more than differentiation\": This is generally false in this context; differentiation is typically more sensitive to noise.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**",

The NDRE is a standard vegetation index used to estimate canopy chlorophyll content. The input variables (reflectances in NIR and red-edge bands) are standard measurements from imaging spectrometers. The concept of uncertainty propagation using a first-order Taylor expansion (the delta method) is a fundamental and widely accepted technique in metrology and statistics, particularly for functions of multiple variables. The inclusion of a correlation term $\\rho$ reflects a realistic scenario where systematic errors (e.g., from sensor calibration, atmospheric correction) affect multiple spectral bands simultaneously.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It defines a function of two random variables whose first two statistical moments (means, variances) and covariance are specified. The task is to compute the approximate variance of the function. The assumption of \"small relative uncertainties\" justifies the use of a first-order Taylor expansion, ensuring a solvable problem with a unique analytical solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, quantitative, and unambiguous terms. All variables are clearly defined.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. It provides all necessary information—the function, the variables, and their statistical properties—to perform the derivation. There are no internal contradictions.\n- **Realism**: The scenario is physically and practically realistic. Reflectance values are always positive, and the denominator $X+Y$ will thus be positive, avoiding singularities. The values of $r_{\\mathrm{NIR}}$, $r_{\\mathrm{RE}}$, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{NIR}}$, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{RE}}$, and $\\rho$ are parameters of a valid physical and statistical model.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a standard and well-defined exercise in error propagation for a function of correlated random variables, set in a scientifically sound context. I will now proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe derivation is based on the propagation of uncertainty for a differentiable function of two correlated random variables, $f(X, Y)$, using a first-order Taylor series expansion around their mean values, $\\mu_X = r_{\\mathrm{NIR}}$ and $\\mu_Y = r_{\\mathrm{RE}}$. The general formula for the variance of $f(X, Y)$ is given by:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(f(X, Y)) \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial X}\\right)^2 \\operatorname{Var}(X) + \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial Y}\\right)^2 \\operatorname{Var}(Y) + 2 \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial X}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial Y}\\right) \\operatorname{Cov}(X, Y)\n$$\nwhere the partial derivatives are evaluated at the mean values $(\\mu_X, \\mu_Y)$.\n\nThe required statistical moments are given as:\n$\\operatorname{Var}(X) = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{NIR}}^2$\n$\\operatorname{Var}(Y) = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{RE}}^2$\nThe covariance is defined in terms of the correlation coefficient $\\rho$:\n$\\operatorname{Cov}(X, Y) = \\rho \\sqrt{\\operatorname{Var}(X)\\operatorname{Var}(Y)} = \\rho \\sigma_{\\mathrm{NIR}} \\sigma_{\\mathrm{RE}}$\n\nThe function in question is the NDRE index:\n$$\nf(X, Y) = \\frac{X - Y}{X + Y}\n$$\n\nFirst, we compute the partial derivatives of $f(X, Y)$ with respect to $X$ and $Y$.\n\nUsing the quotient rule, the partial derivative with respect to $X$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial X} = \\frac{(1)(X + Y) - (X - Y)(1)}{(X + Y)^2} = \\frac{X + Y - X + Y}{(X + Y)^2} = \\frac{2Y}{(X + Y)^2}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, the partial derivative with respect to $Y$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial Y} = \\frac{(-1)(X + Y) - (X - Y)(1)}{(X + Y)^2} = \\frac{-X - Y - X + Y}{(X + Y)^2} = \\frac{-2X}{(X + Y)^2}\n$$\n\nNext, we evaluate these partial derivatives at the mean values of the variables, $X = r_{\\mathrm{NIR}}$ and $Y = r_{\\mathrm{RE}}$:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial X}\\right|_{(\\mu_X, \\mu_Y)} = \\frac{2r_{\\mathrm{RE}}}{(r_{\\mathrm{NIR}} + r_{\\mathrm{RE}})^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial Y}\\right|_{(\\mu_X, \\mu_Y)} = \\frac{-2r_{\\mathrm{NIR}}}{(r_{\\mathrm{NIR}} + r_{\\mathrm{RE}})^2}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions and the statistical moments into the variance propagation formula:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\mathrm{NDRE}) \\approx \\left(\\frac{2r_{\\mathrm{RE}}}{(r_{\\mathrm{NIR}} + r_{\\mathrm{RE}})^2}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{\\mathrm{NIR}}^2 + \\left(\\frac{-2r_{\\mathrm{NIR}}}{(r_{\\mathrm{NIR}} + r_{\\mathrm{RE}})^2}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{\\mathrm{RE}}^2 + 2 \\left(\\frac{2r_{\\mathrm{RE}}}{(r_{\\mathrm{NIR}} + r_{\\mathrm{RE}})^2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{-2r_{\\mathrm{NIR}}}{(r_{\\mathrm{NIR}} + r_{\\mathrm{RE}})^2}\\right) (\\rho \\sigma_{\\mathrm{NIR}} \\sigma_{\\mathrm{RE}})\n$$\n\nSimplify the terms:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\mathrm{NDRE}) \\approx \\frac{4r_{\\mathrm{RE}}^2 \\sigma_{\\mathrm{NIR}}^2}{(r_{\\mathrm{NIR}} + r_{\\mathrm{RE}})^4} + \\frac{4r_{\\mathrm{NIR}}^2 \\sigma_{\\mathrm{RE}}^2}{(r_{\\mathrm{NIR}} + r_{\\mathrm{RE}})^4} - \\frac{8 \\rho r_{\\mathrm{NIR}} r_{\\mathrm{RE}} \\sigma_{\\mathrm{NIR}} \\sigma_{\\mathrm{RE}}}{(r_{\\mathrm{NIR}} + r_{\\mathrm{RE}})^4}\n$$\n\nFactor out the common denominator and the constant $4$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\mathrm{NDRE}) \\approx \\frac{4}{(r_{\\mathrm{NIR}} + r_{\\mathrm{RE}})^4} \\left( r_{\\mathrm{RE}}^2 \\sigma_{\\mathrm{NIR}}^2 + r_{\\mathrm{NIR}}^2 \\sigma_{\\mathrm{RE}}^2 - 2 \\rho r_{\\mathrm{NIR}} r_{\\mathrm{RE}} \\sigma_{\\mathrm{NIR}} \\sigma_{\\mathrm{RE}} \\right)\n$$\n\nThe standard uncertainty, $u_{\\mathrm{NDRE}}$, is the square root of the variance:\n$$\nu_{\\mathrm{NDRE}} = \\sqrt{\\operatorname{Var}(\\mathrm{NDRE})} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{(r_{\\mathrm{NIR}} + r_{\\mathrm{RE}})^4} \\left( r_{\\mathrm{RE}}^2 \\sigma_{\\mathrm{NIR}}^2 + r_{\\mathrm{NIR}}^2 \\sigma_{\\mathrm{RE}}^2 - 2 \\rho r_{\\mathrm{NIR}} r_{\\mathrm{RE}} \\sigma_{\\mathrm{NIR}} \\sigma_{\\mathrm{RE}} \\right)}\n$$\n\nTaking the square root of the pre-factor yields the final expression for the propagated standard uncertainty:\n$$\nu_{\\mathrm{NDRE}} \\approx \\frac{2}{(r_{\\mathrm{NIR}} + r_{\\mathrm{RE}})^2} \\sqrt{r_{\\mathrm{RE}}^2 \\sigma_{\\mathrm{NIR}}^2 + r_{\\mathrm{NIR}}^2 \\sigma_{\\mathrm{RE}}^2 - 2 \\rho r_{\\mathrm{NIR}} r_{\\mathrm{RE}} \\sigma_{\\mathrm{NIR}} \\sigma_{\\mathrm{RE}}}\n$$\nThe quantities $r$ and $\\sigma$ represent dimensionless reflectance values, and $\\rho$ is dimensionless. Therefore, the resulting uncertainty $u_{\\mathrm{NDRE}}$ is also a dimensionless quantity, consistent with the NDRE index itself.
