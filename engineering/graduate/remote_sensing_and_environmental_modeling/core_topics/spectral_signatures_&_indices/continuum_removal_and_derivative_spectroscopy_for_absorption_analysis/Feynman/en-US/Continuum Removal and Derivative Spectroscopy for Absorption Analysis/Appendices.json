The definitions of absorption depth, FWHM, and band area (equivalent width) are fundamental concepts in this field. All premises are factually and scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a clear functional form, precise definitions, and unambiguous constraints on the parameters. The task is to derive two quantities, FWHM and band area, which are uniquely determined by the given information. Thus, a unique and meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, technical language, free of any subjectivity, ambiguity, or opinion-based claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. A full derivation of the solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the absorption depth, $D(\\lambda)$, using its definition and the given function for $R_c(\\lambda)$.\n$$D(\\lambda) = 1 - R_{c}(\\lambda)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $R_c(\\lambda)$:\n$$D(\\lambda) = 1 - \\left(1-A\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(\\lambda-\\lambda_{0})^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$D(\\lambda) = A\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(\\lambda-\\lambda_{0})^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right)$$\nThis function, $D(\\lambda)$, is a Gaussian function with amplitude $A$, centered at $\\lambda = \\lambda_0$.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM)**\n\nThe FWHM is determined based on the absorption depth $D(\\lambda)$.\nFirst, we find the maximum value of $D(\\lambda)$. The exponential term is maximal when its argument is $0$, which occurs at $\\lambda = \\lambda_0$. The maximum value of the exponential is $\\exp(0) = 1$.\nTherefore, the maximum absorption depth is:\n$$D_{\\text{max}} = D(\\lambda_0) = A \\cdot 1 = A$$\nThe half-maximum value is half of this, which is $\\frac{D_{\\text{max}}}{2} = \\frac{A}{2}$.\n\nNext, we find the wavelengths, let's call them $\\lambda_{\\text{half}}$, at which the absorption depth is equal to this half-maximum value. We set $D(\\lambda_{\\text{half}}) = \\frac{A}{2}$:\n$$A\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(\\lambda_{\\text{half}}-\\lambda_{0})^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{A}{2}$$\nSince $A>0$, we can divide both sides by $A$:\n$$\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(\\lambda_{\\text{half}}-\\lambda_{0})^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$-\\frac{(\\lambda_{\\text{half}}-\\lambda_{0})^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\ln(2)$$\nMultiplying by $-1$ and rearranging to solve for $(\\lambda_{\\text{half}}-\\lambda_{0})^{2}$:\n$$(\\lambda_{\\text{half}}-\\lambda_{0})^{2} = 2\\sigma^{2}\\ln(2)$$\nTaking the square root of both sides yields two solutions for $(\\lambda_{\\text{half}}-\\lambda_{0})$:\n$$\\lambda_{\\text{half}}-\\lambda_{0} = \\pm\\sqrt{2\\sigma^{2}\\ln(2)} = \\pm\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\ln(2)}$$\nThis gives two wavelengths, $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$, on either side of the center $\\lambda_0$:\n$$\\lambda_1 = \\lambda_0 - \\sigma\\sqrt{2\\ln(2)}$$\n$$\\lambda_2 = \\lambda_0 + \\sigma\\sqrt{2\\ln(2)}$$\nThe FWHM is defined as the separation between these two wavelengths:\n$$\\text{FWHM} = \\lambda_2 - \\lambda_1 = \\left(\\lambda_0 + \\sigma\\sqrt{2\\ln(2)}\\right) - \\left(\\lambda_0 - \\sigma\\sqrt{2\\ln(2)}\\right)$$\n$$\\text{FWHM} = 2\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\ln(2)}$$\n\n**2. Derivation of the Band Area**\n\nThe band area, which we denote as $\\mathcal{A}$, is the integral of the absorption depth $D(\\lambda)$ over all wavelengths. Mathematically, this is an integral from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$.\n$$\\mathcal{A} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} D(\\lambda) \\, d\\lambda = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} A\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(\\lambda-\\lambda_{0})^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right) \\, d\\lambda$$\nSince $A$ is a constant, it can be taken outside the integral:\n$$\\mathcal{A} = A \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(\\lambda-\\lambda_{0})^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right) \\, d\\lambda$$\nThis is a standard Gaussian integral. We can solve it using a change of variables. Let $u = \\frac{\\lambda - \\lambda_0}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2}}$. Then $\\lambda - \\lambda_0 = u\\sigma\\sqrt{2}$, and $d\\lambda = \\sigma\\sqrt{2} \\, du$. The limits of integration from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$ are unchanged for $u$.\nThe exponent becomes:\n$$-\\frac{(\\lambda-\\lambda_{0})^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}} = -\\frac{(u\\sigma\\sqrt{2})^2}{2\\sigma^2} = -\\frac{u^2 \\sigma^2 \\cdot 2}{2\\sigma^2} = -u^2$$\nSubstituting into the integral:\n$$\\mathcal{A} = A \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-u^2) (\\sigma\\sqrt{2} \\, du)$$\n$$\\mathcal{A} = A\\sigma\\sqrt{2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-u^2) \\, du$$\nThe definite integral $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-x^2) \\, dx$ is the well-known Gaussian integral, which evaluates to $\\sqrt{\\pi}$.\nTherefore, the band area is:\n$$\\mathcal{A} = A\\sigma\\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\pi} = A\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}$$\n\nThe two derived expressions are:\n- FWHM = $2\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\ln(2)}$\n- Band Area = $A\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}$\n\nThese are the closed-form analytic expressions for the FWHM and the band area in terms of the given parameters $A$ and $\\sigma$.",

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and provides a clear basis for evaluating the given options. I will proceed with deriving the solution.\n\n**Derivation of Correct Methodology**\n\nThe analysis of absorption features in a reflectance spectrum, $R(\\lambda)$, is based on a physical model where the observed reflectance is the product of a spectrally broad continuum, $C(\\lambda)$, and a series of spectrally narrower absorption features, which we can represent collectively by a term $A(\\lambda) \\le 1$.\n$$R(\\lambda) = C(\\lambda) \\cdot A(\\lambda)$$\nThe continuum, $C(\\lambda)$, represents the reflectance baseline due to scattering properties of the material's bulk, while $A(\\lambda)$ represents absorption by specific chemical bonds or constituents. The goal of continuum removal is to isolate the absorption component, $A(\\lambda)$, by first estimating and then dividing out the continuum:\n$$R_c(\\lambda) = \\frac{R(\\lambda)}{C(\\lambda)} = A(\\lambda)$$\nThis continuum-removed (or normalized) spectrum, $R_c(\\lambda)$, has values between $0$ and $1$, where $R_c(\\lambda)=1$ represents the continuum level (no absorption) and values less than $1$ indicate absorption.\n\nThe standard procedure involves the following steps:\n1.  **Preprocessing:** Real-world spectra contain noise. Derivatives are extremely sensitive to high-frequency noise. Therefore, the spectrum $R(\\lambda)$ must be smoothed before analysis. A Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter is an excellent choice as it fits a polynomial to a moving window of data points, which tends to preserve the shape and width of spectral features better than simpler smoothers like a moving average. Standard SG algorithms require data on a uniform grid.\n2.  **Continuum Estimation:** The continuum $C(\\lambda)$ is an upper envelope of the spectrum. It is estimated by identifying points on the \"shoulders\" of the spectrum, which are local maxima that lie outside the main absorption features. A robust method to construct $C(\\lambda)$ is to perform piecewise linear interpolation between these identified maxima (often called knots or hull points), $(\\lambda_k, R(\\lambda_k))$. The set of knots must be sorted by increasing wavelength for interpolation.\n3.  **Continuum Removal:** As derived from the physical model, the correct normalization is division: $R_c(\\lambda) = R(\\lambda) / C(\\lambda)$. The smoothed spectrum should be used for consistency if smoothing was performed.\n4.  **Derivative Spectroscopy for Band Center Identification:** An absorption band center corresponds to a local minimum in the continuum-removed spectrum $R_c(\\lambda)$. From calculus, a local minimum at wavelength $\\lambda_0$ is characterized by:\n    -   The first derivative is zero: $\\frac{d R_c}{d \\lambda} \\bigg|_{\\lambda_0} = 0$. Specifically, the derivative must cross from negative to positive.\n    -   The second derivative is positive: $\\frac{d^2 R_c}{d \\lambda^2} \\bigg|_{\\lambda_0} > 0$.\n    Derivatives can be efficiently and consistently computed using the same SG filter framework used for smoothing.\n5.  **Feature Parameterization:** Key parameters of an absorption band are its depth and area.\n    -   **Band Depth:** For a normalized spectrum, depth is defined as $D(\\lambda) = 1 - R_c(\\lambda)$. At the band center $\\lambda_0$, the depth is $D(\\lambda_0) = 1 - R_c(\\lambda_0)$.\n    -   **Band Area:** This is the integral of the depth over the band, $\\int_{\\text{band}} D(\\lambda) d\\lambda$, providing a measure of total absorption.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A.

The continuum is an upper envelope defined by maxima. **Incorrect.**\n-   **Continuum Construction:** A single global cubic polynomial is not flexible enough for most real-world continua and can introduce artifacts. **Incorrect.**\n-   **Continuum Removal:** Subtraction, $R(\\lambda) - C(\\lambda)$, is physically incorrect for normalizing reflectance. **Incorrect.**\n-   **Derivative Spectroscopy:** Computing derivatives on the original spectrum $R(\\lambda)$ conflates continuum slope with absorption features.

The continuum must be a single-valued function of wavelength, $C(\\lambda)$. **Incorrect.**\n-   **Continuum Removal:** Inverting the division, $C(\\lambda)/R(\\lambda)$, is wrong. This would produce values $\\ge 1$. **Incorrect.**\n-   **Derivative Spectroscopy:** A moving-average is an inferior smoother for this task.

Subtracting any polynomial baseline of degree two or higher eliminates curvature artifacts because the second derivative at the band center depends only on $g''(\\lambda_0)$; therefore division and subtraction produce identical band shapes, and band depths cannot be negative under any physically plausible conditions.\n\nC. Continuum division always increases band depth at the center regardless of continuum underestimation because $k(\\lambda_0) \\leq 1$ for any reasonable fit; negative band depths arise only when $D < 0$, which corresponds to emission features.\n\nD. Negative band depth for continuum division arises if $\\hat{C}(\\lambda_0) > C(\\lambda_0)$ and $A = 0$, because then the ratio $k(\\lambda_0)\\,(1 - D)$ exceeds $1$; and baseline subtraction cannot introduce shoulders in the second derivative because $b''(\\lambda_0) = 0$ for quadratic fits, where $b(\\lambda) = C(\\lambda) - \\hat{C}(\\lambda)$.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is a valid exercise in applied calculus and modeling within the field of remote sensing and spectroscopy. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It provides all necessary definitions and simplifying assumptions to proceed with a unique derivation.\n\nWe are given the model for hyperspectral reflectance:\n$$R(\\lambda) = C(\\lambda)\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\tau(\\lambda)\\right) + A$$\nwith the true continuum $C(\\lambda) = \\alpha + \\beta \\lambda$, an additive offset $A$, and the optical depth $\\tau(\\lambda) = D\\,g(\\lambda)$. The band shape is given by $g(\\lambda) = \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(\\lambda - \\lambda_0)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$, and the absorption is weak ($0 < D \\ll 1$). This allows for the first-order Taylor approximation $\\exp(-x) \\approx 1-x$ for $x \\ll 1$.

A negative band depth at the center $\\lambda_0$ means $BD(\\lambda_0) < 0$, which implies $1 - R_d(\\lambda_0) < 0$, or $R_d(\\lambda_0) > 1$.\nThe value of $R_d(\\lambda)$ at the band center is:\n$$R_d(\\lambda_0) = \\frac{R(\\lambda_0)}{\\hat{C}(\\lambda_0)} \\approx \\frac{C(\\lambda_0)(1 - D\\,g(\\lambda_0)) + A}{\\hat{C}(\\lambda_0)} = \\frac{C(\\lambda_0)(1 - D) + A}{\\hat{C}(\\lambda_0)}$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$R_d(\\lambda_0) = \\frac{C(\\lambda_0)}{\\hat{C}(\\lambda_0)}(1-D) + \\frac{A}{\\hat{C}(\\lambda_0)}$$\nTherefore, the condition for a negative band depth is:\n$$\\frac{C(\\lambda_0)}{\\hat{C}(\\lambda_0)}(1-D) + \\frac{A}{\\hat{C}(\\lambda_0)} > 1$$\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. For a linear true continuum and a quadratic fitted baseline, the baseline-subtracted spectrum has second derivative at the band center $R_b''(\\lambda_0) = -2\\,a_2 + C(\\lambda_0)\\,\\dfrac{D}{\\sigma^2}$, showing that residual baseline curvature directly adds to the absorption curvature; continuum division yields $R_d''(\\lambda_0) = k''(\\lambda_0)\\,(1 - D) + k(\\lambda_0)\\,\\dfrac{D}{\\sigma^2} + q''(\\lambda_0)$, where $k(\\lambda) = \\dfrac{C(\\lambda)}{\\hat{C}(\\lambda)}$ and $q(\\lambda) = \\dfrac{A}{\\hat{C}(\\lambda)}$, and the center-band depth $BD(\\lambda_0)$ is negative whenever $\\dfrac{C(\\lambda_0)}{\\hat{C}(\\lambda_0)}\\,(1 - D) + \\dfrac{A}{\\hat{C}(\\lambda_0)} > 1$.**\nThis statement presents three claims.\n1.  The expression for $R_b''(\\lambda_0)$ matches our derived result: $R_b''(\\lambda_0) = -2a_2 + C(\\lambda_0)\\frac{D}{\\sigma^2}$.\n2.  The expression for $R_d''(\\lambda_0)$ matches our derived result: $R_d''(\\lambda_0) = k''(\\lambda_0)(1-D) + k(\\lambda_0)\\frac{D}{\\sigma^2} + q''(\\lambda_0)$.\n3.  The condition for negative band depth matches our derived condition: $\\frac{C(\\lambda_0)}{\\hat{C}(\\lambda_0)}(1-D) + \\frac{A}{\\hat{C}(\\lambda_0)} > 1$.\nAll three parts of this statement are mathematically correct based on the problem's premises.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Subtracting any polynomial baseline of degree two or higher eliminates curvature artifacts because the second derivative at the band center depends only on $g''(\\lambda_0)$; therefore division and subtraction produce identical band shapes, and band depths cannot be negative under any physically plausible conditions.**\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple grounds.\n1.  Our derivation shows $R_b''(\\lambda_0)$ contains the term $-2a_2 = -\\hat{C}''(\\lambda_0)$, which is a curvature artifact. It is not eliminated. Subtracting a higher-order polynomial would still leave a residual curvature term $-\\hat{C}''(\\lambda_0)$.\n2.  Since $R_b''(\\lambda_0)$ and $R_d''(\\lambda_0)$ have different functional forms, division and subtraction do not produce identical band shapes.\n3.  Our analysis of band depth shows that if $C(\\lambda_0)(1-D) + A > \\hat{C}(\\lambda_0)$, the band depth is negative. This is physically plausible, for example if there is a significant additive offset $A$ or if the continuum is significantly underestimated ($\\hat{C}(\\lambda_0)$ is too small).\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Continuum division always increases band depth at the center regardless of continuum underestimation because $k(\\lambda_0) \\leq 1$ for any reasonable fit; negative band depths arise only when $D < 0$, which corresponds to emission features.**\nThis statement is incorrect.\n1.  Continuum underestimation means $\\hat{C}(\\lambda_0) < C(\\lambda_0)$, which implies $k(\\lambda_0) = C(\\lambda_0)/\\hat{C}(\\lambda_0) > 1$. The premise \"$k(\\lambda_0) \\le 1$\" corresponds to overestimation.\n2.  Let's assume $A=0$. Band depth is $BD(\\lambda_0) \\approx 1 - k(\\lambda_0)(1-D)$. The \"true\" depth is approx. $D$. If we have underestimation, $k(\\lambda_0) > 1$, then $BD(\\lambda_0) \\approx 1 - k(\\lambda_0) + k(\\lambda_0)D$. Given $D \\ll 1$, this is approximately $1-k(\\lambda_0)$, which is negative. This is a severe distortion, not an increase. If we have overestimation ($k(\\lambda_0) < 1$), the depth is approximately $1-k(\\lambda_0)$, which is positive but not necessarily larger than $D$.\n3.  As shown in the primary analysis, negative band depths can occur for absorption features ($D>0$) due to continuum model misfit or the additive term $A$. The claim that it only occurs for emission features ($D<0$) is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Negative band depth for continuum division arises if $\\hat{C}(\\lambda_0) > C(\\lambda_0)$ and $A = 0$, because then the ratio $k(\\lambda_0)\\,(1 - D)$ exceeds $1$; and baseline subtraction cannot introduce shoulders in the second derivative because $b''(\\lambda_0) = 0$ for quadratic fits, where $b(\\lambda) = C(\\lambda) - \\hat{C}(\\lambda)$.**\nThis statement is incorrect.\n1.  The condition for negative band depth is $R_d(\\lambda_0) > 1$. If $\\hat{C}(\\lambda_0) > C(\\lambda_0)$ (overestimation) and $A=0$, then $R_d(\\lambda_0) \\approx \\frac{C(\\lambda_0)}{\\hat{C}(\\lambda_0)}(1-D)$. Since $C(\\lambda_0)/\\hat{C}(\\lambda_0) < 1$ and $(1-D) < 1$, their product is necessarily less than $1$. Thus, band depth must be positive. This statement has the condition backwards; negative depth (with $A=0$) requires significant underestimation.\n2.  The residual baseline is $b(\\lambda) = C(\\lambda) - \\hat{C}(\\lambda) = (\\alpha-a_0) + (\\beta-a_1)\\lambda - a_2\\lambda^2$. Its second derivative is $b''(\\lambda) = -2a_2$. The problem states that $a_2$ may be nonzero. Therefore, $b''(\\lambda_0)$ is not generally zero. Residual curvature from the fit, represented by $b''(\\lambda_0)=-2a_2$, is precisely what introduces shape artifacts (like artificial shoulders or broadening) in the second derivative of the subtracted spectrum.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.",
