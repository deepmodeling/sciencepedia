In this case, this means $\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{p}$ must be orthogonal to every vector in the subspace spanned by $\\mathbf{b}$, which is equivalent to being orthogonal to $\\mathbf{b}$ itself.

Reflectance is governed by the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF), which, under topographic or cast shadow, reduces the direct solar irradiance component while leaving a nonzero diffuse sky component. Leaves, due to internal scattering and low absorption in the NIR, typically maintain relatively high NIR reflectance compared to the visible, even under reduced illumination.

The shadowed forest pixel has lower brightness $B$ but higher greenness $G$ than the sunlit sparse pixel because shadow suppresses the visible and SWIR contributions to $B$ while leaf NIR scattering sustains $G$; therefore, using $G$ alone can overestimate vegetation density under shadow, and resolving the ambiguity requires modeling illumination (for example, topographic shading or cast-shadow masks) or incorporating angular reflectance information.\n\nB.

Comparison and Interpretation**\n\n-   **Brightness**: $B_{\\text{shadow}} = 0.249  B_{\\text{sunlit}} = 0.282$. The shadowed pixel is correctly identified as being less bright than the sunlit pixel. This is expected, as shadow reduces the total reflected energy.\n-   **Greenness**: $G_{\\text{shadow}} = 0.150 > G_{\\text{sunlit}} = 0.053$. The shadowed, dense forest pixel has a significantly higher greenness score than the sunlit, sparse vegetation pixel.\n\nThis result demonstrates a classic confounding issue in remote sensing. Greenness is defined by the contrast between high NIR and low visible reflectance. In the shadowed dense canopy, although overall illumination is lower, the NIR reflectance remains relatively high ($0.30$) due to efficient scattering within the leaf structure, while visible reflectances are very low. This strong contrast results in a high greenness score. Conversely, the sunlit sparse pixel has a weaker contrast because the soil background increases visible reflectance and the lower vegetation density results in a slightly lower NIR reflectance.\n\nThe ambiguity is that a high greenness value alone cannot distinguish between dense sunlit vegetation and dense shadowed vegetation, which complicates its use as a direct proxy for vegetation density without accounting for illumination.\n\n**4. Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n- **A.** Correctly states that the shadowed pixel has lower brightness and higher greenness, consistent with our calculations. It provides the correct physical reasoning (shadow suppresses overall brightness, but the strong NIR-visible contrast is maintained in a dense canopy) and correctly identifies the resulting ambiguity and potential solutions (modeling illumination).\n\n- **B.** Incorrect. Our calculation shows $G_{\\text{shadow}} > G_{\\text{sunlit}}$. The premise that greenness is illumination-invariant is also false.\n\n- **C.** Incorrect. Our calculations show the opposite relationships for both brightness and greenness. The reasoning is also flawed.\n\n- **D.** Incorrect. It misinterprets the greenness index as a proxy for water content. The Tasseled Cap Wetness index, not Greenness, is designed for that purpose. Ignoring brightness is also inadvisable as it contains crucial information about illumination conditions.\n\nTherefore, option A provides the most accurate and comprehensive analysis of the situation.",
