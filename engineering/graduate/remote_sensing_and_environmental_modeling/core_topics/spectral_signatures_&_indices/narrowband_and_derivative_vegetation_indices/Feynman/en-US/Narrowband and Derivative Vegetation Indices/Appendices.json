            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an expression for the standard deviation of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, $\\sigma_{NDVI}$, based on the standard deviations of the red and near-infrared reflectances, $\\sigma_{red}$ and $\\sigma_{NIR}$, respectively. The derivation will be based on the first-order Taylor series approximation for uncertainty propagation, commonly known as the law of propagation of errors.\n\nThe Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ($NDVI$) is given by the function:\n$$\nNDVI = f(\\rho_{red}, \\rho_{NIR}) = \\frac{\\rho_{NIR} - \\rho_{red}}{\\rho_{NIR} + \\rho_{red}}\n$$\nwhere $\\rho_{red}$ is the red reflectance and $\\rho_{NIR}$ is the near-infrared reflectance.\n\nThe problem states that the measurement errors in $\\rho_{red}$ and $\\rho_{NIR}$ are small, independent, and have zero mean. For a function $f$ of two independent random variables $x_1$ and $x_2$, with means $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$ and standard deviations $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$, the variance of $f(x_1, x_2)$, denoted $\\sigma_f^2$, can be approximated to first order by:\n$$\n\\sigma_f^2 \\approx \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1} \\right)^2 \\sigma_1^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_2} \\right)^2 \\sigma_2^2\n$$\nThe partial derivatives are evaluated at the mean values of the variables, which are $\\rho_{red}$ and $\\rho_{NIR}$ themselves, as the errors are assumed to have zero mean (and the retrievals are unbiased).\n\nApplying this general formula to our specific case, we have $x_1 = \\rho_{red}$ and $x_2 = \\rho_{NIR}$.

            "solution": "The user wants me to determine the conditions under which a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI-like) using a red-edge band ($705\\ \\mathrm{nm}$) is preferable to one using a red band ($670\\ \\mathrm{nm}$) for monitoring high levels of chlorophyll, based on an analysis of index saturation.\n\n### Step 1: Validation of the Problem Statement\n\nFirst, I will validate the problem statement.\n\n**Givens:**\n-   Index definition: $I(\\lambda_{v};C) = \\dfrac{R(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{NIR}};C) - R(\\lambda_{v};C)}{R(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{NIR}};C) + R(\\lambda_{v};C)}$.\n-   Visible band options: $\\lambda_{v} \\in \\{670\\ \\mathrm{nm},\\,705\\ \\mathrm{nm}\\}$.\n-   NIR reflectance model: $R(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{NIR}};C) \\approx N$, where $N$ is a constant.\n-   Visible reflectance model: $R(\\lambda_{v};C) \\approx R_{\\min}(\\lambda_{v}) + \\Delta R(\\lambda_{v})\\,\\exp(-k(\\lambda_{v})\\,C\\,L)$.\n-   Parameters: $C$ is chlorophyll concentration, $L$ is effective optical path length, $k(\\lambda)$ is the chlorophyll-specific absorption coefficient.\n-   Known property: The absorption coefficient in the red is much greater than in the red-edge, i.e., $k(670\\ \\mathrm{nm}) \\gg k(705\\ \\mathrm{nm})$.\n-   Objective: To minimize saturation of the index at high $C$, which means maximizing a sustained sensitivity to changes in $C$.\n\n**Validation:**\n1.  **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is scientifically sound. It uses a standard formulation for a normalized difference index. The reflectance model is a simplified but physically plausible representation of light interaction with a vegetation canopy, based on the Beer-Lambert law. The described spectral properties of chlorophyll (high absorption at $670\\ \\mathrm{nm}$, lower at $705\\ \\mathrm{nm}$, and negligible effect on NIR reflectance) are well-established facts in plant biophysics and remote sensing. The concept of index saturation is a known and critical issue with indices like NDVI, and the use of red-edge bands to mitigate it is a standard technique.\n2.  **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It asks for a comparison of the sensitivity of two index configurations with respect to chlorophyll concentration. \"Saturation\" is defined operationally as the condition where the index is no longer sensitive to changes in chlorophyll. This can be quantified by examining the derivative of the index with respect to chlorophyll concentration, $\\dfrac{\\partial I}{\\partial C}$. The provided models are sufficient to calculate this derivative and analyze its behavior. A unique, meaningful conclusion can be derived.\n3.  **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in objective, mathematical, and physical terms. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the derivation.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe goal is to analyze the sensitivity of the index $I(\\lambda_v; C)$ to changes in chlorophyll concentration $C$. Saturation occurs when this sensitivity, given by the derivative $\\dfrac{\\partial I}{\\partial C}$, approaches zero.\n\nFirst, let's write the index using the given models:\n$$I(\\lambda_v; C) = \\frac{N - \\left[R_{\\min}(\\lambda_v) + \\Delta R(\\lambda_v)\\,\\exp(-k(\\lambda_v)\\,C\\,L)\\right]}{N + \\left[R_{\\min}(\\lambda_v) + \\Delta R(\\lambda_v)\\,\\exp(-k(\\lambda_v)\\,C\\,L)\\right]}$$\nLet's simplify the notation by letting $R_v(C) = R(\\lambda_v;C)$. The index is $I(C) = \\dfrac{N-R_v(C)}{N+R_v(C)}$.\n\nTo find the sensitivity, we compute the derivative $\\dfrac{\\partial I}{\\partial C}$ using the quotient rule.\nLet $U(C) = N - R_v(C)$ and $V(C) = N + R_v(C)$.\nThen $U'(C) = -\\dfrac{\\partial R_v}{\\partial C_v}$ and $V'(C) = \\dfrac{\\partial R_v}{\\partial C}$.\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial C} = \\frac{U'(C)V(C) - U(C)V'(C)}{[V(C)]^2} = \\frac{(-\\frac{\\partial R_v}{\\partial C})(N+R_v) - (N-R_v)(\\frac{\\partial R_v}{\\partial C})}{(N+R_v)^2}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial C} = \\frac{-\\frac{\\partial R_v}{\\partial C} [ (N+R_v) + (N-R_v) ]}{(N+R_v)^2} = \\frac{-2N}{(N+R_v(C))^2} \\frac{\\partial R_v}{\\partial C}$$\nNow, we need the derivative of the reflectance $R_v(C)$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial R_v}{\\partial C} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial C} \\left[ R_{\\min}(\\lambda_v) + \\Delta R(\\lambda_v)\\,\\exp(-k(\\lambda_v)\\,C\\,L) \\right]$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial R_v}{\\partial C} = \\Delta R(\\lambda_v) \\cdot \\exp(-k(\\lambda_v)\\,C\\,L) \\cdot (-k(\\lambda_v)\\,L)$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial R_v}{\\partial C} = -k(\\lambda_v)\\,L\\,\\Delta R(\\lambda_v)\\,\\exp(-k(\\lambda_v)\\,C\\,L)$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\dfrac{\\partial I}{\\partial C}$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial C} = \\frac{-2N}{(N+R_v(C))^2} \\left[ -k(\\lambda_v)\\,L\\,\\Delta R_v\\,\\exp(-k(\\lambda_v)\\,C\\,L) \\right]$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial C} = \\frac{2\\,N\\,L\\,\\Delta R(\\lambda_v)}{(N+R_v(C))^2} \\cdot k(\\lambda_v)\\,\\exp(-k(\\lambda_v)\\,C\\,L)$$\n\nIndex saturation occurs at high chlorophyll content $C$, where $\\dfrac{\\partial I}{\\partial C} \\to 0$. The behavior of this derivative as $C$ becomes large is dominated by the exponential term $\\exp(-k(\\lambda_v)\\,C\\,L)$, as the denominator $(N+R_v(C))^2$ approaches a constant, finite value $(N+R_{\\min}(\\lambda_v))^2$. The entire expression for sensitivity goes to zero as $C \\to \\infty$.\n\nThe key is the *rate* at which this sensitivity approaches zero. A slower decay means the index remains sensitive over a wider range of high $C$ values, thus avoiding saturation. The rate of decay is determined by the term in the exponent, $k(\\lambda_v)\\,C\\,L$.\n\nLet's compare the two cases:\n1.  **Red Band ($\\lambda_v = 670\\ \\mathrm{nm}$)**: The absorption coefficient $k(670)$ is very large. Consequently, for a high chlorophyll content $C$, the product $k(670)\\,C\\,L$ becomes very large ($k(670)\\,C\\,L \\gg 1$). This causes the exponential term $\\exp(-k(670)\\,C\\,L)$ to become vanishingly small. As a result, $\\dfrac{\\partial I(670)}{\\partial C}$ rapidly approaches $0$. The reflectance $R(670;C)$ approaches its minimum value $R_{\\min}(670)$, and the index becomes insensitive to further increases in $C$. This is the definition of saturation.\n\n2.  **Red-Edge Band ($\\lambda_v = 705\\ \\mathrm{nm}$)**: The absorption coefficient $k(705)$ is much smaller than $k(670)$. For the same high chlorophyll content $C$ where the red band is saturated, the product $k(705)\\,C\\,L$ will be significantly smaller. It is plausible that we can find a range of high $C$ where $k(670)\\,C\\,L \\gg 1$ but $k(705)\\,C\\,L$ is still of order 1 or less (i.e., $k(705)\\,C\\,L \\lesssim 1$). In this regime, the exponential term $\\exp(-k(705)\\,C\\,L)$ is still non-negligible, and so is the sensitivity $\\dfrac{\\partial I(705)}{\\partial C}$. The index continues to respond to changes in $C$.\n\nTherefore, the red-edge option ($705\\ \\mathrm{nm}$) is preferable to the red option ($670\\ \\mathrm{nm}$) for avoiding saturation at high chlorophyll content, specifically under conditions where the optical depth for the red channel is already very high, but the optical depth for the red-edge channel is not.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. When $k(670\\ \\mathrm{nm})\\,C\\,L \\gg 1$ but $k(705\\ \\mathrm{nm})\\,C\\,L \\lesssim 1$, because then $\\dfrac{\\partial I}{\\partial C}$ at $670\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ tends to $0$ as $R(670\\ \\mathrm{nm};C)\\to R_{\\min}(670\\ \\mathrm{nm})$, while $\\dfrac{\\partial I}{\\partial C}$ at $705\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ remains appreciable due to weaker absorption on the red-edge slope, preserving dynamic range at high $C$.**\nThis statement accurately describes the conclusion of our derivation. The condition $k(670\\ \\mathrm{nm})\\,C\\,L \\gg 1$ defines the onset of saturation for the red band, causing its reflectance to hit the floor $R_{\\min}(670\\ \\mathrm{nm})$ and its sensitivity $\\dfrac{\\partial I}{\\partial C}$ to approach zero. The condition $k(705\\ \\mathrm{nm})\\,C\\,L \\lesssim 1$ describes the regime where the red-edge band, due to weaker absorption, remains sensitive. This preserves the dynamic range of the index for high chlorophyll concentrations.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. When soil background dominates reflectance (very small $L$), because the $705\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ band is more sensitive to soil than to chlorophyll, thereby avoiding saturation caused by pigment absorption.**\nThis is incorrect. The problem of saturation is relevant for dense canopies (high $C$, non-negligible $L$), not for soil-dominated scenes where canopies are sparse (small $L$ or low $C$). In sparse canopies, neither index would be saturated. The premise that the $705\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ band is \"more sensitive to soil\" is unsubstantiated and distracts from the core issue of chlorophyll absorption.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. When chlorophyll content is high, the $670\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ option is preferable because stronger absorption prevents index saturation by keeping the denominator $R(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{NIR}};C)+R(670\\ \\mathrm{nm};C)$ small, thus amplifying sensitivity.**\nThis argument is flawed. Stronger absorption is the *cause* of saturation, not its prevention. While it is true that high absorption at $670\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ leads to a very low $R(670;C)$ and thus a smaller denominator term, this effect is minuscule compared to the dominant effect of the exponential decay in the sensitivity expression $\\dfrac{\\partial I}{\\partial C}$. The term $\\exp(-k(670)\\,C\\,L)$ in the numerator of the sensitivity term drives the sensitivity to zero much more powerfully than any change in the denominator can counteract.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Preference is governed primarily by instrument noise-equivalent reflectance difference; for equal spectral bandwidth and signal-to-noise ratio, the normalized form ensures identical saturation behavior for $670\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ and $705\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ regardless of $k(\\lambda)$, so neither is preferable on biophysical grounds.**\nThis is incorrect. The statement that saturation behavior is \"identical... regardless of $k(\\lambda)$\" is demonstrably false, as our derivation shows that the saturation is fundamentally controlled by the product $k(\\lambda)CL$ in the exponential term. The biophysical properties, specifically the difference in $k(\\lambda)$ between the red and red-edge regions, are the primary reason for the difference in saturation behavior. While instrument noise is a practical factor, it does not erase the underlying biophysical principles that the question explicitly asks about.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

Derivation of the Correlation Coefficient**\n\nThe two-band first-derivative vegetation index is given by\n$$D(\\lambda_{1},\\lambda_{2}) = \\frac{\\overline{R}(\\lambda_{2}) - \\overline{R}(\\lambda_{1})}{\\lambda_{2} - \\lambda_{1}}$$\nUsing the provided first-order approximation $\\overline{R}(\\lambda_{i}) \\approx R(\\lambda_{i}; C,L,S)$, and letting $\\Delta\\lambda = \\lambda_{2} - \\lambda_{1}$, we can write\n$$D = \\frac{R(\\lambda_{2}; C, L, S) - R(\\lambda_{1}; C, L, S)}{\\Delta\\lambda}$$\nSubstituting the reflectance model $R(\\lambda; C, L, S) \\approx R_{0}(\\lambda) + k_{C}\\,b(\\lambda)\\,C + k_{L}\\,c(\\lambda)\\,L + k_{S}\\,d(\\lambda)\\,S + \\epsilon(\\lambda)$ gives:\n$$D = \\frac{R_0(\\lambda_2) - R_0(\\lambda_1)}{\\Delta\\lambda} + k_C\\frac{b(\\lambda_2) - b(\\lambda_1)}{\\Delta\\lambda}C + k_L\\frac{c(\\lambda_2) - c(\\lambda_1)}{\\Delta\\lambda}L + k_S\\frac{d(\\lambda_2) - d(\\lambda_1)}{\\Delta\\lambda}S + \\frac{\\epsilon(\\lambda_2) - \\epsilon(\\lambda_1)}{\\Delta\\lambda}$$\nThis can be expressed in terms of sensitivities $S_X = \\frac{\\partial D}{\\partial X}$ as\n$D = D_{ref} + S_C C + S_L L + S_S S + S_\\epsilon$\nwhere the sensitivities are:\n$S_C = k_C\\frac{b(\\lambda_2) - b(\\lambda_1)}{\\Delta\\lambda}$, $S_L = k_L\\frac{c(\\lambda_2) - c(\\lambda_1)}{\\Delta\\lambda}$, $S_S = k_S\\frac{d(\\lambda_2) - d(\\lambda_1)}{\\Delta\\lambda}$.\nThe noise contribution is $S_\\epsilon = \\frac{\\epsilon(\\lambda_2) - \\epsilon(\\lambda_1)}{\\Delta\\lambda}$.\n\nThe correlation coefficient between $D$ and $C$ is $\\rho(D, C) = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(D, C)}{\\sigma_D \\sigma_C}$.\nThe variables $C$, $L$, $S$ and the noise $\\epsilon$ are given as mutually independent and zero-mean.\nThe covariance is $\\text{Cov}(D, C) = E[(D - E[D])(C - E[C])]$.\nSince $E[C]=E[L]=E[S]=E[\\epsilon]=0$, the expectation of $D$ is $E[D] = D_{ref}$.\n$\\text{Cov}(D, C) = E[(S_C C + S_L L + S_S S + S_\\epsilon)C] = S_C E[C^2] + S_L E[LC] + S_S E[SC] + E[S_\\epsilon C]$.\nDue to independence, $E[LC] = E[L]E[C]=0$, $E[SC]=E[S]E[C]=0$, and $E[S_\\epsilon C]=0$.\nThus, $\\text{Cov}(D, C) = S_C E[C^2] = S_C \\sigma_C^2$.\n\nThe variance of $D$ is $\\sigma_D^2 = \\text{Var}(D_{ref} + S_C C + S_L L + S_S S + S_\\epsilon)$. As all variables are independent, the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances:\n$\\sigma_D^2 = \\text{Var}(S_C C) + \\text{Var}(S_L L) + \\text{Var}(S_S S) + \\text{Var}(S_\\epsilon)$\n$\\sigma_D^2 = S_C^2 \\sigma_C^2 + S_L^2 \\sigma_L^2 + S_S^2 \\sigma_S^2 + \\text{Var}\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon(\\lambda_2) - \\epsilon(\\lambda_1)}{\\Delta\\lambda}\\right)$.\nAssuming the measurement noise $\\epsilon(\\lambda)$ is uncorrelated between different bands, $\\text{Cov}(\\epsilon(\\lambda_1), \\epsilon(\\lambda_2)) = 0$.\n$\\text{Var}(\\epsilon(\\lambda_2) - \\epsilon(\\lambda_1)) = \\text{Var}(\\epsilon(\\lambda_2)) + \\text{Var}(\\epsilon(\\lambda_1)) = \\sigma_\\epsilon^2 + \\sigma_\\epsilon^2 = 2\\sigma_\\epsilon^2$.\nSo, the noise variance term is $\\frac{2\\sigma_\\epsilon^2}{(\\Delta\\lambda)^2}$.\nThe total variance of $D$ is $\\sigma_D^2 = S_C^2 \\sigma_C^2 + S_L^2 \\sigma_L^2 + S_S^2 \\sigma_S^2 + \\frac{2\\sigma_\\epsilon^2}{(\\Delta\\lambda)^2}$.\n\nFinally, the correlation coefficient is:\n$$\\rho(D, C) = \\frac{S_C \\sigma_C^2}{\\sigma_C \\sqrt{S_C^2 \\sigma_C^2 + S_L^2 \\sigma_L^2 + S_S^2 \\sigma_S^2 + \\frac{2\\sigma_\\epsilon^2}{(\\Delta\\lambda)^2}}} = \\frac{S_C \\sigma_C}{\\sqrt{S_C^2 \\sigma_C^2 + S_L^2 \\sigma_L^2 + S_S^2 \\sigma_S^2 + \\frac{2\\sigma_\\epsilon^2}{(\\lambda_2 - \\lambda_1)^2}}}$$\n\n**2. SRF Overlap Constraint**\n\nA Gaussian function with full width at half maximum (FWHM) is related to its standard deviation $\\sigma_{SRF}$ by $\\text{FWHM} = 2\\sqrt{2\\ln(2)}\\,\\sigma_{SRF}$.\nGiven $\\text{FWHM} = 10$, the standard deviation of the SRF is $\\sigma_{SRF} = \\frac{10}{2\\sqrt{2\\ln(2)}} = \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{2\\ln(2)}}$.\n\nThe overlap constraint is based on the integral of the product of the two SRF profiles. A standard, dimensionless measure of overlap between two distributions is the Bhattacharyya coefficient, which for two Gaussians with identical variance $\\sigma_{SRF}^2$ and separated by $\\Delta\\lambda = \\lambda_2 - \\lambda_1$ is $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\Delta\\lambda)^2}{8\\sigma_{SRF}^2}\\right)$. The problem's phrasing \"integral of their product normalized by the peak product\" most closely corresponds to a similar quantity, the fidelity or squared overlap, which is $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\Delta\\lambda)^2}{4\\sigma_{SRF}^2}\\right)$. We adopt this common and formally robust interpretation.\n\nThe constraint is $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\Delta\\lambda)^2}{4\\sigma_{SRF}^2}\\right) < 0.05$.\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-\\frac{(\\Delta\\lambda)^2}{4\\sigma_{SRF}^2} < \\ln(0.05)$\n$\\frac{(\\Delta\\lambda)^2}{4\\sigma_{SRF}^2} > -\\ln(0.05) = \\ln(20)$\n$(\\Delta\\lambda)^2 > 4\\sigma_{SRF}^2 \\ln(20)$\nSince $\\Delta\\lambda = \\lambda_2 - \\lambda_1 > 0$, we take the positive root:\n$\\Delta\\lambda > 2\\sigma_{SRF}\\sqrt{\\ln(20)}$.\nSubstituting $\\sigma_{SRF} = \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{2\\ln2}}$:\n$\\Delta\\lambda > 2 \\left(\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{2\\ln2}}\\right) \\sqrt{\\ln(20)} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\ln(20)}{2\\ln(2)}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\ln(20)}{\\ln(4)}}$.\nNumerically, $\\ln(20) \\approx 2.9957$ and $\\ln(4) \\approx 1.3863$.\n$\\Delta\\lambda > 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{2.9957}{1.3863}} \\approx 10 \\sqrt{2.1609} \\approx 14.70$ nm.\nThe band separation must be greater than approximately $14.7$ nm.\n\n**3. Formulation of the Constrained Optimization Problem**\n\nThe goal is to choose $(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2)$ to maximize the correlation $\\rho(D,C)$. This is equivalent to maximizing its square, $\\rho^2(D,C)$, which simplifies the expression by removing the square root.\n$$\\rho^2(D, C) = \\frac{S_C^2 \\sigma_C^2}{S_C^2 \\sigma_C^2 + S_L^2 \\sigma_L^2 + S_S^2 \\sigma_S^2 + \\frac{2\\sigma_\\epsilon^2}{(\\Delta\\lambda)^2}}$$\nSubstitute the expressions for the sensitivities, with $k_C=k_L=k_S=1$:\n$$S_C^2 = \\left(\\frac{b(\\lambda_2) - b(\\lambda_1)}{\\Delta\\lambda}\\right)^2, \\quad S_L^2 = \\left(\\frac{c(\\lambda_2) - c(\\lambda_1)}{\\Delta\\lambda}\\right)^2, \\quad S_S^2 = \\left(\\frac{d(\\lambda_2) - d(\\lambda_1)}{\\Delta\\lambda}\\right)^2$$\nThe objective function becomes:\n$$ \\text{maximize}_{\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2} \\quad J(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2) = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{b(\\lambda_2) - b(\\lambda_1)}{\\Delta\\lambda}\\right)^2 \\sigma_C^2}{\\left(\\frac{b(\\lambda_2) - b(\\lambda_1)}{\\Delta\\lambda}\\right)^2 \\sigma_C^2 + \\left(\\frac{c(\\lambda_2) - c(\\lambda_1)}{\\Delta\\lambda}\\right)^2 \\sigma_L^2 + \\left(\\frac{d(\\lambda_2) - d(\\lambda_1)}{\\Delta\\lambda}\\right)^2 \\sigma_S^2 + \\frac{2\\sigma_\\epsilon^2}{(\\Delta\\lambda)^2}} $$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $(\\Delta\\lambda)^2$ simplifies the function to:\n$$ J(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2) = \\frac{(b(\\lambda_2) - b(\\lambda_1))^2 \\sigma_C^2}{(b(\\lambda_2) - b(\\lambda_1))^2 \\sigma_C^2 + (c(\\lambda_2) - c(\\lambda_1))^2 \\sigma_L^2 + (d(\\lambda_2) - d(\\lambda_1))^2 \\sigma_S^2 + 2\\sigma_\\epsilon^2} $$\nThe constraints are:\n1. $\\lambda_1 \\in [705, 715]$ nm\n2. $\\lambda_2 \\in [730, 740]$ nm\n3. $\\Delta\\lambda = \\lambda_2 - \\lambda_1 > 14.7$ nm\n\nLet's check the third constraint. The minimum possible separation is $\\lambda_{2,min} - \\lambda_{1,max} = 730 - 715 = 15$ nm. Since $15 > 14.7$, this constraint is automatically satisfied by the band center constraints.\nThe optimization problem is therefore:\n**Maximize**:\n$$J(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2) = \\frac{(b(\\lambda_2) - b(\\lambda_1))^2 \\sigma_C^2}{(b(\\lambda_2) - b(\\lambda_1))^2 \\sigma_C^2 + (c(\\lambda_2) - c(\\lambda_1))^2 \\sigma_L^2 + (d(\\lambda_2) - d(\\lambda_1))^2 \\sigma_S^2 + 2\\sigma_\\epsilon^2}$$\n**Subject to**:\n$705 \\le \\lambda_1 \\le 715$\n$730 \\le \\lambda_2 \\le 740$\n\n**4. Numerical Solution of the Optimization Problem**\n\nLet's analyze the objective function $J = \\frac{X}{X+Y}$, where $X(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2) = (b(\\lambda_2)-b(\\lambda_1))^2 \\sigma_C^2$ is the signal component and $Y(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2) = (c(\\lambda_2)-c(\\lambda_1))^2 \\sigma_L^2 + (d(\\lambda_2)-d(\\lambda_1))^2 \\sigma_S^2 + 2\\sigma_\\epsilon^2$ is the noise and interference component. To maximize $J$, we must maximize the ratio $X/Y$.\n\nThe spectral kernels are centered at $720$ nm ($b(\\lambda)$), $850$ nm ($c(\\lambda)$), and $560$ nm ($d(\\lambda)$). The wavelength ranges $[705, 715]$ and $[730, 740]$ are far from the centers of $c(\\lambda)$ and $d(\\lambda)$. In these ranges, $c(\\lambda)$ and $d(\\lambda)$ are extremely small. For instance, $c(740) \\approx 6 \\times 10^{-5}$ and $d(705) \\approx 2 \\times 10^{-12}$. Consequently, the changes $(\\Delta c)^2$ and $(\\Delta d)^2$ are negligible compared to the measurement noise term $2\\sigma_\\epsilon^2 = 2(2.5 \\times 10^{-3}) = 5 \\times 10^{-3}$.\nThe denominator is therefore dominated by the signal term and the constant noise variance, making the objective function approximately:\n$$ J(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2) \\approx \\frac{(b(\\lambda_2) - b(\\lambda_1))^2 \\sigma_C^2}{(b(\\lambda_2) - b(\\lambda_1))^2 \\sigma_C^2 + 2\\sigma_\\epsilon^2} $$\nThis function is monotonically increasing with $|b(\\lambda_2) - b(\\lambda_1)|$. The optimization problem reduces to maximizing the magnitude of the difference in the chlorophyll kernel, $|b(\\lambda_2) - b(\\lambda_1)|$, subject to the box constraints on $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$.\n\nThe kernel $b(\\lambda) = \\exp(-\\frac{(\\lambda - 720)^2}{2 \\times 12^2})$ is a Gaussian centered at $720$ nm.\n- In the interval $\\lambda_1 \\in [705, 715]$, the function $b(\\lambda)$ is strictly increasing. Its values range from $b(705) \\approx 0.458$ to $b(715) \\approx 0.917$.\n- In the interval $\\lambda_2 \\in [730, 740]$, the function $b(\\lambda)$ is strictly decreasing. Its values range from $b(730) \\approx 0.707$ to $b(740) \\approx 0.249$.\n\nTo maximize the difference $|b(\\lambda_2) - b(\\lambda_1)|$, we must choose the points that yield the maximum and minimum values of $b(\\lambda)$ across the two intervals.\nThe maximum value of $b(\\lambda)$ in the entire domain $[705,715] \\cup [730,740]$ is $b(715) \\approx 0.917$.\nThe minimum value of $b(\\lambda)$ in the entire domain is $b(740) \\approx 0.249$.\nThe difference is maximized by choosing $\\lambda_1 = 715$ nm and $\\lambda_2 = 740$ nm. At these points, $|b(740) - b(715)| = |0.249 - 0.917| = 0.668$. Any other combination of $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$ will result in a smaller difference.\n\nThus, the optimal band centers are at the corners of the search space that maximize the change in the chlorophyll-sensitive kernel.\nThe optimal values, already given to three significant figures, are $\\lambda_1 = 715$ nm and $\\lambda_2 = 740$ nm.",
