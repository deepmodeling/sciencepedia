            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an expression for the standard deviation of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, $\\sigma_{NDVI}$, based on the standard deviations of the red and near-infrared reflectances, $\\sigma_{red}$ and $\\sigma_{NIR}$, respectively. The derivation will be based on the first-order Taylor series approximation for uncertainty propagation, commonly known as the law of propagation of errors.\n\nThe Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ($NDVI$) is given by the function:\n$$\nNDVI = f(\\rho_{red}, \\rho_{NIR}) = \\frac{\\rho_{NIR} - \\rho_{red}}{\\rho_{NIR} + \\rho_{red}}\n$$\nwhere $\\rho_{red}$ is the red reflectance and $\\rho_{NIR}$ is the near-infrared reflectance.\n\nThe problem states that the measurement errors in $\\rho_{red}$ and $\\rho_{NIR}$ are small, independent, and have zero mean.

            "problem": "A research team is evaluating two narrowband configurations for a normalized difference reflectance index of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)-type, constructed from a near-infrared (NIR) band and a visible band. They consider using either a red band centered at $670\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ or a red-edge band centered at $705\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ for the visible channel, with the NIR band held fixed near $800\\ \\mathrm{nm}$. The goal is to minimize saturation of the index at high leaf chlorophyll content, so that the index remains sensitive to changes in chlorophyll in dense, healthy canopies.\n\nAssume the following physically based simplifications:\n- Leaf-level absorption of chlorophyll follows the Beer–Lambert law. Let $k(\\lambda)$ denote the chlorophyll-specific absorption coefficient at wavelength $\\lambda$, $C$ the leaf chlorophyll areal concentration, and $L$ an effective optical path length through the foliage (proportional to leaf layer thickness and canopy structure). Then the transmitted fraction along a path obeys $\\exp\\!\\left(-k(\\lambda)\\,C\\,L\\right)$.\n- In the red to red-edge spectral region, canopy reflectance at wavelength $\\lambda$, as a function of $C$, can be approximated by $R(\\lambda;C) \\approx R_{\\min}(\\lambda) + \\Delta R(\\lambda)\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-k(\\lambda)\\,C\\,L\\right)$, where $R_{\\min}(\\lambda)$ is a low reflectance floor due to multiple scattering and $0<\\Delta R(\\lambda)$ captures the reduction from the no-pigment baseline.

When chlorophyll content is high, the $670\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ option is preferable because stronger absorption prevents index saturation by keeping the denominator $R(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{NIR}};C)+R(670\\ \\mathrm{nm};C)$ small, thus amplifying sensitivity.\n\nD. Preference is governed primarily by instrument noise-equivalent reflectance difference; for equal spectral bandwidth and signal-to-noise ratio, the normalized form ensures identical saturation behavior for $670\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ and $705\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ regardless of $k(\\lambda)$, so neither is preferable on biophysical grounds.\n\nSelect the single best option.",
            "solution": "The problem asks us to determine which index formulation, one using a red band (670 nm) and one using a red-edge band (705 nm), is less prone to saturation at high chlorophyll content ($C$). Saturation occurs when the index loses sensitivity to changes in $C$. Therefore, we need to analyze the sensitivity, which is the derivative of the index with respect to chlorophyll, $\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial C}$.\n\nThe index is defined as $I(\\lambda_v; C) = \\frac{N - R(\\lambda_v; C)}{N + R(\\lambda_v; C)}$, where $N$ is the constant NIR reflectance and $R(\\lambda_v; C)$ is the visible band reflectance.

As $C$ becomes very large, this term determines how quickly the sensitivity approaches zero.\n\n1.  **Red Band (670 nm):** At this wavelength, the chlorophyll-specific absorption coefficient, $k(670)$, is very high. For a dense canopy (high $C$ and $L$), the product $k(670)CL$ becomes much greater than 1 ($k(670)CL \\gg 1$). Consequently, the exponential term $\\exp(-k(670)CL)$ rapidly approaches zero. The reflectance $R(670;C)$ approaches its floor value $R_{\\min}(670)$, and the sensitivity $\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial C}$ vanishes. The index is saturated.\n\n2.  **Red-Edge Band (705 nm):** At this wavelength, the absorption coefficient $k(705)$ is significantly smaller than $k(670)$. In the same high-chlorophyll regime where the red band is saturated, it is possible that the product $k(705)CL$ is still of order 1 or less ($k(705)CL \\lesssim 1$). In this case, the exponential term $\\exp(-k(705)CL)$ is not close to zero, and the sensitivity $\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial C}$ remains appreciable. The index continues to respond to changes in $C$.\n\nThis analysis shows that the red-edge index avoids saturation at higher chlorophyll levels than the red index. Option A correctly summarizes this physical reasoning: the red band saturates when its optical depth ($kCL$) becomes large, while the red-edge band remains sensitive because its optical depth is smaller. The other options are incorrect: B is about sparse canopies, C incorrectly argues that strong absorption prevents saturation, and D wrongly claims that saturation behavior is independent of the biophysical parameter $k(\\lambda)$.",
