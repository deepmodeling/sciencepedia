            "problem": "Consider a single timing path in a digital integrated circuit analyzed under Parametric On-Chip Variation (POCV). On-Chip Variation (OCV) refers to random delay fluctuations due to process, voltage, and temperature variations across the chip. Advanced On-Chip Variation (AOCV) models introduce context dependence (for example, path depth and slews) via stage-specific derate tables, while Parametric On-Chip Variation (POCV) models the path delay as a random variable built from the statistical aggregation of per-stage delay variations.\n\nAssume the path delay is modeled as the sum of independent stage delays. Let the nominal delay of stage $i$ be $d_{0,i}$ and its zero-mean local random variation be $\\delta d_{i}$ with standard deviation $\\sigma_{i}$, and assume $\\delta d_{i}$ are mutually independent across stages. Under the central limit theorem, the path delay distribution approaches a Gaussian with mean equal to the sum of nominal delays and variance equal to the sum of the stage variances. For a $k$-standard-deviation ($k\\sigma$) yield target (one-sided), the additive margin is defined as the $k$ times the path standard deviation.\n\nGiven the following path of five arcs with nominal delays and local standard deviations:\n- Stage $1$: $d_{0,1} = 28\\ \\mathrm{ps}$, $\\sigma_{1} = 1.5\\ \\mathrm{ps}$,\n- Stage $2$: $d_{0,2} = 45\\ \\mathrm{ps}$, $\\sigma_{2} = 2.1\\ \\mathrm{ps}$,\n- Stage $3$: $d_{0,3} = 37\\ \\mathrm{ps}$, $\\sigma_{3} = 1.8\\ \\mathrm{ps}$,\n- Stage $4$: $d_{0,4} = 22\\ \\mathrm{ps}$, $\\sigma_{4} = 1.2\\ \\mathrm{ps}$,\n- Stage $5$: $d_{0,5} = 40\\ \\mathrm{ps}$, $\\sigma_{5} = 2.5\\ \\mathrm{ps}$,\n\nand the yield target $k = 3$, derive from first principles:\n1.

            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of statistical static timing analysis (SSTA), specifically the Parametric On-Chip Variation (POCV) model. All necessary data is provided, the problem is well-posed, and its terms are defined objectively, allowing for a unique, verifiable solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the calculation of the path timing margin and the corresponding multiplicative derate factor for a digital logic path composed of $N=5$ stages, based on the POCV model. The delay of each stage $i$, denoted by $D_i$, is a random variable given by the sum of its nominal delay $d_{0,i}$ and a zero-mean random variation $\\delta d_i$.\n$$D_i = d_{0,i} + \\delta d_i$$\nThe random variations $\\delta d_i$ are mutually independent across all stages, with a mean $E[\\delta d_i] = 0$ and a standard deviation $\\sigma_i$.\n\nThe total path delay, $D_{path}$, is the sum of the individual stage delays:\n$$D_{path} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} D_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (d_{0,i} + \\delta d_i)$$\n\nFirst, we determine the statistical properties of the total path delay. The mean of the path delay, $\\mu_{path}$, is the sum of the means of the individual stage delays. The mean of a single stage delay is:\n$$E[D_i] = E[d_{0,i} + \\delta d_i] = E[d_{0,i}] + E[\\delta d_i] = d_{0,i} + 0 = d_{0,i}$$\nsince $d_{0,i}$ is a constant. Therefore, the mean of the total path delay is the sum of the nominal stage delays:\n$$\\mu_{path} = E[D_{path}] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} D_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[D_i] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} d_{0,i}$$\nThis sum represents the nominal path delay.\n\nNext, we find the variance of the path delay, $\\sigma_{path}^2$. Because the random variations $\\delta d_i$ are mutually independent, the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances. The variance of a single stage delay is:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(D_i) = \\mathrm{Var}(d_{0,i} + \\delta d_i) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\delta d_i) = \\sigma_i^2$$\nThus, the variance of the total path delay is:\n$$\\sigma_{path}^2 = \\mathrm{Var}(D_{path}) = \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} D_i\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathrm{Var}(D_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sigma_i^2$$\nThe standard deviation of the path delay is the square root of the variance:\n$$\\sigma_{path} = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sigma_i^2}$$\n\nThe problem requires two calculations: the path $k\\sigma$ margin and the multiplicative derate factor.\n\n1.  **Path $k\\sigma$ Margin Calculation**\n\nThe additive path margin is defined as $k$ times the path standard deviation, for a yield target of $k$ standard deviations.
