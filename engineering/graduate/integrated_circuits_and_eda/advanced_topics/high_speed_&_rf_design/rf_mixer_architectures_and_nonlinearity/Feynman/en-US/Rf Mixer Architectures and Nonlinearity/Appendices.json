            "problem": "A single-conversion superheterodyne receiver employs a sinusoidal Radio Frequency (RF) input at frequency $f_{\\mathrm{RF}}$, which is multiplied by a sinusoidal Local Oscillator (LO) at frequency $f_{\\mathrm{LO}}$ in a mixer. The multiplication operation is the fundamental basis for frequency translation: the product of two sinusoids produces new spectral components at the sum and difference of their original frequencies. An Intermediate Frequency (IF) band-pass filter centered at frequency $f_{\\mathrm{IF}}$ follows the mixer. Assume an ideal, time-invariant, memoryless multiplication in the mixer core and neglect all higher-order nonlinear terms except those that realize the desired frequency translation.\n\nPart (a): Starting from the multiplication model for mixing and the trigonometric identity that the product of cosines yields sum and difference frequency components, derive the set of RF frequencies that produce the same IF magnitude as a desired RF input.

            "solution": "The problem statement is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of radio frequency (RF) circuit design, specifically the operation of superheterodyne receivers. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains a complete and consistent set of data sufficient to derive a unique, meaningful solution for both parts. There are no identifiable violations of scientific principles, logical contradictions, or ambiguities.\n\n### Part (a): Derivation of Image Frequencies\n\nThe core of a mixer's operation is multiplication. Let the RF input signal be a sinusoid $v_{\\mathrm{RF}}(t)$ and the local oscillator (LO) signal be another sinusoid $v_{\\mathrm{LO}}(t)$. We can represent them as:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{RF}}(t) = A_{\\mathrm{RF}} \\cos(2\\pi f_{\\mathrm{RF}} t)$$\n$$v_{\\mathrm{LO}}(t) = A_{\\mathrm{LO}} \\cos(2\\pi f_{\\mathrm{LO}} t)$$\nwhere $A_{\\mathrm{RF}}$ and $A_{\\mathrm{LO}}$ are the respective amplitudes, and $f_{\\mathrm{RF}}$ and $f_{\\mathrm{LO}}$ are the frequencies.\n\nAn ideal mixer performs a multiplication of these two signals. The output voltage, $v_{\\mathrm{out}}(t)$, is proportional to their product:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{out}}(t) = K \\cdot v_{\\mathrm{RF}}(t) \\cdot v_{\\mathrm{LO}}(t) = K A_{\\mathrm{RF}} A_{\\mathrm{LO}} \\cos(2\\pi f_{\\mathrm{RF}} t) \\cos(2\\pi f_{\\mathrm{LO}} t)$$\nwhere $K$ is a constant representing the mixer's conversion gain characteristic.\n\nUsing the trigonometric product-to-sum identity $\\cos(\\alpha)\\cos(\\beta) = \\frac{1}{2}[\\cos(\\alpha - \\beta) + \\cos(\\alpha + \\beta)]$, we can expand the expression for the output voltage:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{out}}(t) = \\frac{K A_{\\mathrm{RF}} A_{\\mathrm{LO}}}{2} \\left[ \\cos(2\\pi (f_{\\mathrm{RF}} - f_{\\mathrm{LO}}) t) + \\cos(2\\pi (f_{\\mathrm{RF}} + f_{\\mathrm{LO}}) t) \\right]$$\nThis equation shows that the mixer output contains two spectral components, one at the difference frequency $|f_{\\mathrm{RF}} - f_{\\mathrm{LO}}|$ and one at the sum frequency $f_{\\mathrm{RF}} + f_{\\mathrm{LO}}$.\n\nIn a superheterodyne receiver, an intermediate frequency (IF) band-pass filter follows the mixer. This filter is centered at a specific frequency, $f_{\\mathrm{IF}}$, and is designed to pass only one of these components. The sum frequency component, $f_{\\mathrm{RF}} + f_{\\mathrm{LO}}$, is typically at a much higher frequency than the desired IF and is easily rejected by subsequent filtering. The desired frequency translation relies on the difference frequency component.\n\nFor a signal to pass through the IF filter, its frequency must match the filter's center frequency, $f_{\\mathrm{IF}}$. Therefore, the relationship between the input RF frequency and the LO frequency is given by:\n$$|f_{\\mathrm{RF}} - f_{\\mathrm{LO}}| = f_{\\mathrm{IF}}$$\n\nThis equation defines the set of RF frequencies that are downconverted to the desired intermediate frequency $f_{\\mathrm{IF}}$. To find these frequencies, we solve for $f_{\\mathrm{RF}}$:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{RF}} - f_{\\mathrm{LO}} = \\pm f_{\\mathrm{IF}}$$\n$$f_{\\mathrm{RF}} = f_{\\mathrm{LO}} \\pm f_{\\mathrm{IF}}$$\n\nThis gives two possible RF frequencies that produce an IF output at $f_{\\mathrm{IF}}$ with the same magnitude:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{RF},1} = f_{\\mathrm{LO}} + f_{\\mathrm{IF}}$$\n$$f_{\\mathrm{RF},2} = f_{\\mathrm{LO}} - f_{\\mathrm{IF}}$$\n\nOne of these frequencies is the desired signal frequency, while the other is its \"image\" frequency. A single-ended mixer architecture, based on simple multiplication, cannot distinguish between these two frequencies. Both are downconverted to the same IF, making them indistinguishable at the IF output. The closed-form relation for the set of such RF frequencies is thus $f_{\\mathrm{RF}} = f_{\\mathrm{LO}} \\pm f_{\\mathrm{IF}}$.\n\n### Part (b): Calculation of Required Image Rejection\n\nThe objective is to compute the minimum additional image suppression, denoted as $\\mathrm{IRR}$, required from the mixer's phasing network. This can be solved by performing a careful power budget analysis for both the desired signal (S) and the image signal (IM) as they propagate through the receiver front-end.\n\nFirst, we identify the specific frequencies from the given data:\n- Desired signal frequency: $f_{\\mathrm{S}} = 2.10\\,\\mathrm{GHz}$\n- Local oscillator frequency: $f_{\\mathrm{LO}} = 2.05\\,\\mathrm{GHz}$\n- Intermediate frequency: $f_{\\mathrm{IF}} = 50\\,\\mathrm{MHz} = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{GHz}$\n\nLet's verify the mixing plan. The difference frequency is $|f_{\\mathrm{S}} - f_{\\mathrm{LO}}| = |2.10 - 2.05|\\,\\mathrm{GHz} = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{GHz}$, which is equal to $f_{\\mathrm{IF}}$. This confirms consistency. Since $f_{\\mathrm{S}} > f_{\\mathrm{LO}}$, this configuration is known as high-side injection, and the desired signal is on the upper sideband of the LO.\n\nFrom Part (a), the image frequency, $f_{\\mathrm{IM}}$, is located at $f_{\\mathrm{LO}} - f_{\\mathrm{IF}}$:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{IM}} = 2.05\\,\\mathrm{GHz} - 0.05\\,\\mathrm{GHz} = 2.00\\,\\mathrm{GHz}$$\n\nNext, we trace the power of both signals in decibels relative to $1\\,\\mathrm{mW}$ (dBm).\n\n**Desired Signal (S) Path Power Analysis:**\n1.  Input power at antenna: $P_{\\mathrm{S, in}} = -80\\,\\mathrm{dBm}$ at $f_{\\mathrm{S}} = 2.10\\,\\mathrm{GHz}$.\n2.  After RF preselector (insertion loss $L_{\\mathrm{pre,S}} = 2\\,\\mathrm{dB}$):\n    $P_{\\mathrm{S, pre}} = P_{\\mathrm{S, in}} - L_{\\mathrm{pre,S}} = -80\\,\\mathrm{dBm} - 2\\,\\mathrm{dB} = -82\\,\\mathrm{dBm}$.\n3.  After mixer (conversion gain $G_{\\mathrm{mix}} = 7\\,\\mathrm{dB}$):\n    $P_{\\mathrm{S, mix}} = P_{\\mathrm{S, pre}} + G_{\\mathrm{mix}} = -82\\,\\mathrm{dBm} + 7\\,\\mathrm{dB} = -75\\,\\mathrm{dBm}$.\n4.  After IF filter (insertion loss $L_{\\mathrm{IF}} = 6\\,\\mathrm{dB}$):\n    $P_{\\mathrm{S, out}} = P_{\\mathrm{S, mix}} - L_{\\mathrm{IF}} = -75\\,\\mathrm{dBm} - 6\\,\\mathrm{dB} = -81\\,\\mathrm{dBm}$.\n\n**Image Signal (IM) Path Power Analysis:**\n1.  Input power at antenna: $P_{\\mathrm{IM, in}} = -20\\,\\mathrm{dBm}$ at $f_{\\mathrm{IM}} = 2.00\\,\\mathrm{GHz}$.\n2.  After RF preselector (attenuation $A_{\\mathrm{pre,IM}} = 35\\,\\mathrm{dB}$):\n    $P_{\\mathrm{IM, pre}} = P_{\\mathrm{IM, in}} - A_{\\mathrm{pre,IM}} = -20\\,\\mathrm{dBm} - 35\\,\\mathrm{dB} = -55\\,\\mathrm{dBm}$.\n3.  After mixer: The image is converted with the same intrinsic gain $G_{\\mathrm{mix}} = 7\\,\\mathrm{dB}$, but is further suppressed by the additional image rejection $\\mathrm{IRR}$ provided by the phasing network. $\\mathrm{IRR}$ acts as an additional loss for the image path.\n    $P_{\\mathrm{IM, mix}} = P_{\\mathrm{IM, pre}} + G_{\\mathrm{mix}} - \\mathrm{IRR} = -55\\,\\mathrm{dBm} + 7\\,\\mathrm{dB} - \\mathrm{IRR} = (-48 - \\mathrm{IRR})\\,\\mathrm{dBm}$.\n4.  After IF filter: The downconverted image is also at $f_{\\mathrm{IF}}$, so it experiences the same loss $L_{\\mathrm{IF}} = 6\\,\\mathrm{dB}$.\n    $P_{\\mathrm{IM, out}} = P_{\\mathrm{IM, mix}} - L_{\\mathrm{IF}} = (-48 - \\mathrm{IRR})\\,\\mathrm{dBm} - 6\\,\\mathrm{dB} = (-54 - \\mathrm{IRR})\\,\\mathrm{dBm}$.\n\n**System Requirement:**\nThe desired-to-image power ratio at the IF filter output, $\\mathrm{DIR}_{\\mathrm{out}}$, must be at least $50\\,\\mathrm{dB}$.\n$$\\mathrm{DIR}_{\\mathrm{out}} = P_{\\mathrm{S, out}} - P_{\\mathrm{IM, out}} \\ge 50\\,\\mathrm{dB}$$\n\n**Calculation for IRR:**\nSubstituting the derived output power expressions into the requirement inequality:\n$$(-81\\,\\mathrm{dBm}) - ((-54 - \\mathrm{IRR})\\,\\mathrm{dBm}) \\ge 50\\,\\mathrm{dB}$$\n$$-81 - (-54 - \\mathrm{IRR}) \\ge 50$$\n$$-81 + 54 + \\mathrm{IRR} \\ge 50$$\n$$-27 + \\mathrm{IRR} \\ge 50$$\n$$\\mathrm{IRR} \\ge 50 + 27$$\n$$\\mathrm{IRR} \\ge 77\\,\\mathrm{dB}$$\n\nThe minimum additional image suppression required from the mixer's phasing network is $77\\,\\mathrm{dB}$. To adhere to the requested precision of three significant figures, the result is $77.0\\,\\mathrm{dB}$.\nThis value represents the rejection that must be provided by the image-reject mixer itself, on top of the $33\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ of image rejection already provided by the RF preselector (which is the difference between its attenuation at the image frequency, $35\\,\\mathrm{dB}$, and its loss at the signal frequency, $2\\,\\mathrm{dB}$).",

As defined in the problem statement, this is the difference, in decibels, between the input-referred one-decibel compression point ($P_{1\\mathrm{dB,in}}$), which represents the maximum usable input power, and the minimum detectable input signal power ($P_{\\mathrm{in,min}}$).

This is the input signal power that produces the minimum required signal-to-noise ratio at the output, $\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\min} = 10~\\mathrm{dB}$.

Let $A = A_{\\mathrm{IIP3,static}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{2\\alpha_{1}A_{\\mathrm{IIP3,static}}}{\\pi} = \\frac{3\\alpha_{3}A_{\\mathrm{IIP3,static}}^{3}}{2\\pi}\n$$\nSolving for the squared amplitude gives the input intercept point:\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{IIP3,static}}^{2} = \\frac{4\\alpha_{1}}{3\\alpha_{3}}\n$$\n\n**Time-Varying Nonlinearity Model**\nHere, the coefficients vary with time: $\\alpha_{1}(t) = \\alpha_{1}(1+\\beta\\cos(2\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}t))$ and $\\alpha_{3}(t) = \\alpha_{3}(1+\\eta\\cos(2\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}t))$.\nThe output current involves products of multiple sinusoids. We must find all mixing paths that contribute to the fundamental and IM3 tones at IF.\nA general RF current component of the form $C(1+\\gamma\\cos(2\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}t))\\cos(\\omega_{\\mathrm{in}}t)$, where $\\omega_{\\mathrm{in}}=\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}+\\delta$, contains three frequency terms:\n$C\\cos((\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}+\\delta)t) + \\frac{C\\gamma}{2}\\cos((\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}-\\delta)t) + \\frac{C\\gamma}{2}\\cos((3\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}+\\delta)t)$.\nWhen mixed with $s(t)=\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\cos(\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}t)$, the first term downconverts to $\\delta$ with amplitude $\\frac{2C}{\\pi}$, and the second term also downconverts to $\\delta$ with amplitude $\\frac{C\\gamma}{\\pi}$. The third term does not produce an IF tone.\nThe total IF amplitude is the sum: $\\frac{2C}{\\pi} + \\frac{C\\gamma}{\\pi} = \\frac{C}{\\pi}(2+\\gamma)$.\n\nFor the fundamental IF component, the corresponding RF current amplitude is $C=\\alpha_1 A$, and the modulation parameter is $\\gamma=\\beta$. The IF amplitude is:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{IF,Fund,tv}} = \\frac{\\alpha_{1}A}{\\pi}(2+\\beta)\n$$\nFor the IM3 IF component, the RF current amplitude from $v^3(t)$ is $C=\\alpha_3(\\frac{3}{4}A^3)$, and the modulation parameter is $\\gamma=\\eta$. The IF amplitude is:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{IF,IM3,tv}} = \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\left(\\alpha_{3}\\frac{3}{4}A^{3}\\right)(2+\\eta) = \\frac{3\\alpha_3 A^3}{4\\pi}(2+\\eta)\n$$\nEquating these amplitudes at $A=A_{\\mathrm{IIP3,tv}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha_{1}A_{\\mathrm{IIP3,tv}}}{\\pi}(2+\\beta) = \\frac{3\\alpha_{3}A_{\\mathrm{IIP3,tv}}^{3}}{4\\pi}(2+\\eta)\n$$\nSolving for the squared amplitude:\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{IIP3,tv}}^{2} = \\frac{4\\alpha_{1}(2+\\beta)}{3\\alpha_{3}(2+\\eta)} = A_{\\mathrm{IIP3,static}}^{2} \\left(\\frac{2+\\beta}{2+\\eta}\\right)\n$$\n\n**Difference in IIP3**\nThe problem asks for $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{IIP3}} = \\mathrm{IIP3}_{\\mathrm{static}} - \\mathrm{IIP3}_{\\mathrm{time-varying}}$ in decibels. The IIP3 in dB (typically power, e.g., dBm) is proportional to $10\\log_{10}(A_{\\mathrm{IIP3}}^{2})$.\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\mathrm{IIP3}} = 10\\log_{10}\\left(A_{\\mathrm{IIP3,static}}^{2}\\right) - 10\\log_{10}\\left(A_{\\mathrm{IIP3,tv}}^{2}\\right)\n= 10\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{IIP3,static}}^{2}}{A_{\\mathrm{IIP3,tv}}^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the derived ratio:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\mathrm{IIP3}} = 10\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{IIP3,static}}^{2}}{A_{\\mathrm{IIP3,static}}^{2} \\left(\\frac{2+\\beta}{2+\\eta}\\right)}\\right) = 10\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{2+\\eta}{2+\\beta}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values $\\beta=0.50$ and $\\eta=0.10$.\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\mathrm{IIP3}} = 10\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{2+0.10}{2+0.50}\\right) = 10\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{2.10}{2.50}\\right) = 10\\log_{10}(0.84)\n$$\nCalculating the value and rounding to four significant figures:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\mathrm{IIP3}} \\approx 10 \\times (-0.0757209) \\approx -0.757209 \\, \\mathrm{dB}\n$$\nThe result rounded to four significant figures is $-0.7572$ dB.",
