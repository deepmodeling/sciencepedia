            "solution": "The problem asks for the calculation of the normalized residual intersymbol interference (ISI) power for a discrete-time communication system. The system consists of a transmit-side Feed-Forward Equalizer (FFE) followed by a linear time-invariant (LTI) channel.\n\nFirst, we establish the mathematical model of the system. The FFE and the channel are both LTI systems. When two LTI systems are cascaded, the overall system is also LTI, and its impulse response is the convolution of the individual impulse responses. Let the impulse response of the FFE be $w[n]$ and the impulse response of the channel be $h[n]$. The overall effective impulse response at the receiver sampling instants, denoted by $g[n]$, is given by the convolution:\n$$\ng[n] = (w * h)[n] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} w[k] h[n-k]\n$$\n\nFrom the problem statement, the FFE has three taps with coefficients $\\{w_{-1}, w_{0}, w_{+1}\\} = \\{0.2, 1.0, -0.2\\}$. The tap index $k$ corresponds to the time index of the filter's impulse response.

            "problem": "A high-speed serial transmitter employs a two-tap Feed-Forward Equalizer (FFE) to pre-emphasize transitions and mitigate channel loss. The transmitted symbol sequence is binary and non-return-to-zero, represented by a discrete-time sequence $s[n] \\in \\{+1,-1\\}$ at rate $R$. The FFE output is modeled as the linear, time-invariant superposition\n$$x[n] = a\\,s[n] + b\\,s[n-1],$$\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are real tap weights. The transmitter implements pre-emphasis such that the voltage on an isolated transition $0 \\rightarrow 1$ (or $-1 \\rightarrow +1$) during the first unit interval equals $V_{\\text{high}}$, while the voltage during a steady run of identical bits equals $V_{\\text{low}}$. Define the pre-emphasis ratio as $P = V_{\\text{high}}/V_{\\text{low}}$.\n\nThe channel is linear time-invariant with frequency response $H(f)$. Assume $|H(0)|$ is normalized to unity and define the channel attenuation at the Nyquist frequency $R/2$ as $A = |H(R/2)|$, with $0  A  1$. The receiver samples at the center of each unit interval, there is no additional equalization, and noise is negligible. The maximum magnitude of the transmitter output is limited by $|x[n]| \\leq V_{\\text{max}}$ for all $n$.\n\nStarting from linear systems principles (superposition, convolution, and the discrete-time Fourier transform), and using physically justified assumptions about worst-case patterns (steady run and alternating pattern), derive the relationship needed to choose $P$ that equalizes the combined low-frequency and Nyquist-frequency magnitudes at the receiver sample time. Then, enforce the transmitter swing limit and the following eye specification: the minimum required eye height at the receiver sample is $E_{\\min} = 0.30$ expressed in $\\text{V}$. The swing limit is $V_{\\text{max}} = 0.60$ expressed in $\\text{V}$, and the channel attenuation is $A = 0.35$ (dimensionless).\n\nCompute the required pre-emphasis ratio $P$ as a dimensionless number that meets the minimum eye height under the swing limit. If the specification is achievable, provide $P$. Otherwise, use the value of $P$ that maximizes the eye height under the swing limit. Round your final numerical answer for $P$ to four significant figures, and express it as a unitless quantity.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the pre-emphasis ratio $P$ for a two-tap transmit Feed-Forward Equalizer (FFE) that equalizes the channel response at low and Nyquist frequencies, while satisfying constraints on transmitter output swing and receiver eye height.\n\nFirst, we formalize the relationship between the FFE tap weights, $a$ and $b$, and the pre-emphasis ratio, $P$. The FFE output is given by the discrete-time convolution:\n$$x[n] = a\\,s[n] + b\\,s[n-1]$$\nwhere $s[n] \\in \\{+1,-1\\}$ is the input symbol sequence.\n\nThe steady run voltage, $V_{\\text{low}}$, corresponds to a sequence of identical bits, e.g., $s[n] = s[n-1] = +1$. The output voltage is:\n$$x[n] = a(+1) + b(+1) = a+b$$\nThus, we identify $V_{\\text{low}} = a+b$. For pre-emphasis to reduce the signal level for steady bits relative to transitions, we expect $a$ to be the main tap and $b$ to have the opposite sign, with $|a|  |b|$. Let's assume $a  0$ and $b  0$, which makes $a+b  0$.\n\nThe high-frequency or transition voltage, $V_{\\text{high}}$, corresponds to a transition, e.g., $s[n-1] = -1$ and $s[n] = +1$. The output voltage during the first unit interval of the new bit is:\n$$x[n] = a(+1) + b(-1) = a-b$$\nThus, we identify $V_{\\text{high}} = a-b$. With $a0$ and $b0$, $V_{\\text{high}}$ is the largest possible output magnitude.\n\nThe pre-emphasis ratio $P$ is defined as:\n$$P = \\frac{V_{\\text{high}}}{V_{\\text{low}}} = \\frac{a-b}{a+b}$$\nThis equation connects the descriptive parameter $P$ to the filter coefficients $a$ and $b$.\n\nNext, we analyze the system in the frequency domain. The FFE is a linear, time-invariant (LTI) filter with an impulse response $h_{\\text{FFE}}[n] = a\\,\\delta[n] + b\\,\\delta[n-1]$. Its discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT), or frequency response, defined over the frequency range $-R/2 \\le f \\le R/2$, is:\n$$H_{\\text{FFE}}(f) = a + b\\,\\exp\\left(-j2\\pi f \\frac{1}{R}\\right)$$\nThe overall system frequency response, from the input symbols $s[n]$ to the receiver input, is the product of the FFE response and the channel response $H(f)$:\n$$G(f) = H_{\\text{FFE}}(f) H(f) = \\left(a + b\\,\\exp\\left(-j2\\pi f/R\\right)\\right) H(f)$$\n\nThe problem requires choosing $P$ to equalize the combined low-frequency and Nyquist-frequency magnitudes at the receiver. This is a form of zero-forcing equalization targeting the Nyquist frequency.\n\nAt low frequency ($f \\rightarrow 0$), the magnitude of the system response is:\n$$|G(0)| = \\left|a + b\\,\\exp(0)\\right| |H(0)| = |a+b| \\cdot 1 = a+b$$\nWe have used the given normalization $|H(0)|=1$ and our assumption that $a+b  0$. This corresponds to the received amplitude for a DC or steady-state signal.\n\nAt the Nyquist frequency, $f_{\\text{Nyq}} = R/2$, the magnitude of the system response is:\n$$|G(R/2)| = \\left|a + b\\,\\exp\\left(-j2\\pi (R/2)/R\\right)\\right| |H(R/2)| = |a + b\\,\\exp(-j\\pi)| |H(R/2)|$$\nSince $\\exp(-j\\pi) = -1$ and we are given $|H(R/2)| = A$, this becomes:\n$$|G(R/2)| = |a-b| A$$\nWith our assumption $a-b  0$, this is $|G(R/2)| = (a-b)A$. This corresponds to the received amplitude for a worst-case alternating pattern ($+1, -1, +1, -1, \\ldots$).\n\nThe equalization condition is $|G(0)| = |G(R/2)|$:\n$$a+b = (a-b)A$$\nTo find the required pre-emphasis ratio $P$, we can rearrange this equation. Dividing both sides by $a+b$ (which is non-zero for a non-zero signal) gives:\n$$1 = \\frac{a-b}{a+b} A$$\nSubstituting the definition $P = (a-b)/(a+b)$, we get:\n$$1 = P \\cdot A \\implies P = \\frac{1}{A}$$\nThis is the required pre-emphasis ratio to achieve equalization.\n\nNow, we must verify if this choice of $P$ is compatible with the transmitter swing and receiver eye height constraints.\nThe given values are:\nChannel attenuation at Nyquist: $A = 0.35$\nTransmitter swing limit: $V_{\\text{max}} = 0.60 \\, \\text{V}$\nMinimum required eye height: $E_{\\min} = 0.30 \\, \\text{V}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the required $P$:\n$$P = \\frac{1}{A} = \\frac{1}{0.35}$$\n\nNext, we check the constraints. The instantaneous transmitter output is $x[n] = a\\,s[n] + b\\,s[n-1]$. The possible output magnitudes are $|a+b|$ and $|a-b|$. Since $P  1$, we have $|a-b|  |a+b|$. Thus, the maximum transmitter swing is $|a-b|$. The swing limit constraint is:\n$$|a-b| \\leq V_{\\text{max}}$$\nThe eye height at the receiver, $E_H$, is the vertical opening in the eye diagram at the sampling instant. With equalization, the \"high\" level for a steady run of ones and for an alternating pattern are the same, equal to $Y_{\\text{level}} = a+b = (a-b)A$. By symmetry, the \"low\" level is $-Y_{\\text{level}}$. The eye height is the difference between these levels:\n$$E_H = Y_{\\text{level}} - (-Y_{\\text{level}}) = 2Y_{\\text{level}} = 2(a+b)$$\nThe eye height specification is $E_H \\geq E_{\\min}$, which means:\n$$2(a+b) \\geq E_{\\min}$$\nTo achieve the largest possible eye height, we should drive the transmitter to its maximum possible swing, so we set $|a-b| = V_{\\text{max}}$ (or some value close to it). If we set $|a-b|=V_{\\text{max}}$, the corresponding eye height is:\n$$E_H = 2(a+b) = 2((a-b)A) = 2\\,V_{\\text{max}}\\,A$$\nThis is the maximum achievable eye height, $E_{H, \\text{max}}$, under the equalization condition and swing limit. We must check if this maximum possible eye height meets the specification:\n$$E_{H, \\text{max}} \\geq E_{\\min}$$\n$$2\\,V_{\\text{max}}\\,A \\geq E_{\\min}$$\nPlugging in the given numerical values:\n$$2 \\cdot (0.60) \\cdot (0.35) \\geq 0.30$$\n$$1.20 \\cdot 0.35 \\geq 0.30$$\n$$0.42 \\geq 0.30$$\nThe inequality is true, which means the specification is achievable. The required pre-emphasis ratio is indeed $P=1/A$, which is determined by the equalization goal. The problem states that if the specification were not achievable, we should use the value of $P$ that maximizes the eye height. As shown, maximizing eye height involves using the maximum swing, but the ratio $P$ that relates low- and high-frequency gain is fixed by the equalization goal to $1/A$. Therefore, the value of $P$ would be the same in that case.\n\nSince the specification is achievable, we compute the value of $P$.\n$$P = \\frac{1}{0.35} = \\frac{1}{35/100} = \\frac{100}{35} = \\frac{20}{7}$$\n$$P \\approx 2.8571428...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $P = 2.857$.",

The matrix $H$ is symmetric, so $H^{\\mathsf{T}}=H$.\nFirst, calculate $H^{\\mathsf{T}}H = H^2$:\n$$H^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  \\frac{1}{2}  0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}  1  \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ 0  \\frac{1}{2}  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  \\frac{1}{2}  0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}  1  \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ 0  \\frac{1}{2}  1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1+\\frac{1}{4}  \\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}  \\frac{1}{4} \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}  \\frac{1}{4}+1+\\frac{1}{4}  \\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \\frac{1}{4}  \\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}  \\frac{1}{4}+1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{5}{4}  1  \\frac{1}{4} \\\\ 1  \\frac{3}{2}  1 \\\\ \\frac{1}{4}  1  \\frac{5}{4} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nNext, we form the matrix $A = H^{\\mathsf{T}}H + \\lambda I$ with $\\lambda = 0.1 = \\frac{1}{10}$:\n$$A = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{5}{4}  1  \\frac{1}{4} \\\\ 1  \\frac{3}{2}  1 \\\\ \\frac{1}{4}  1  \\frac{5}{4} \\end{pmatrix} + \\frac{1}{10}\\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0 \\\\ 0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{5}{4}+\\frac{1}{10}  1  \\frac{1}{4} \\\\ 1  \\frac{3}{2}+\\frac{1}{10}  1 \\\\ \\frac{1}{4}  1  \\frac{5}{4}+\\frac{1}{10} \\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$A = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{25+2}{20}  1  \\frac{5}{20} \\\\ 1  \\frac{15+1}{10}  1 \\\\ \\frac{5}{20}  1  \\frac{25+2}{20} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{27}{20}  1  \\frac{5}{20} \\\\ 1  \\frac{16}{10}  1 \\\\ \\frac{5}{20}  1  \\frac{27}{20} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe right-hand side of the optimality condition is $H^{\\mathsf{T}}d$:\n$$H^{\\mathsf{T}}d = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  \\frac{1}{2}  0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}  1  \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ 0  \\frac{1}{2}  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ 1 \\\\ \\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nWe must solve the system $Aw = H^{\\mathsf{T}}d$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{27}{20}  1  \\frac{5}{20} \\\\ 1  \\frac{16}{10}  1 \\\\ \\frac{5}{20}  1  \\frac{27}{20} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}w_0 \\\\ w_1 \\\\ w_2\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ 1 \\\\ \\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe system of equations exhibits symmetry. The first and third rows of the matrix are reflections of each other, and the right-hand side vector has identical first and third components. This implies that $w_0 = w_2$.\nUsing this symmetry, we can simplify the system. The first equation becomes:\n$\\frac{27}{20}w_0 + w_1 + \\frac{5}{20}w_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies \\frac{27}{20}w_0 + w_1 + \\frac{5}{20}w_0 = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies \\frac{32}{20}w_0 + w_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies \\frac{8}{5}w_0 + w_1 = \\frac{1}{2}$\nThe second equation becomes:\n$w_0 + \\frac{16}{10}w_1 + w_2 = 1 \\implies w_0 + \\frac{8}{5}w_1 + w_0 = 1 \\implies 2w_0 + \\frac{8}{5}w_1 = 1$\nWe now have a $2 \\times 2$ system for $w_0$ and $w_1$:\n1) $\\frac{8}{5}w_0 + w_1 = \\frac{1}{2}$\n2) $2w_0 + \\frac{8}{5}w_1 = 1$\nFrom equation (1), we express $w_1$ in terms of $w_0$: $w_1 = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{8}{5}w_0$.\nSubstitute this into equation (2):\n$2w_0 + \\frac{8}{5}\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{8}{5}w_0\\right) = 1$\n$2w_0 + \\frac{4}{5} - \\frac{64}{25}w_0 = 1$\n$w_0\\left(2 - \\frac{64}{25}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{4}{5}$\n$w_0\\left(\\frac{50 - 64}{25}\\right) = \\frac{1}{5}$\n$w_0\\left(-\\frac{14}{25}\\right) = \\frac{1}{5}$\n$w_0 = \\frac{1}{5} \\left(-\\frac{25}{14}\\right) = -\\frac{5}{14}$\nNow we find $w_1$:\n$w_1 = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{8}{5}w_0 = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{8}{5}\\left(-\\frac{5}{14}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{8}{14} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{7+8}{14} = \\frac{15}{14}$\nAnd $w_2 = w_0$, so $w_2 = -\\frac{5}{14}$.\nThe FFE tap vector that minimizes the cost function is $w = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{5}{14}  \\frac{15}{14}  -\\frac{5}{14} \\end{pmatrix}^{\\mathsf{T}}$.",
