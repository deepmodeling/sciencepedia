The physical model of a TSV is a standard and simplified representation used in electronic design automation (EDA) and integrated circuit analysis. The provided numerical values are realistic for contemporary 3D integration technologies. The problem is objective, well-posed, complete, and contains no contradictions. For instance, the void radius $r_{\\mathrm{v}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\mathrm{m}$ is smaller than the copper core radius $R-t = 5.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\mathrm{m} - 5.0 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\mathrm{m} = 4.95 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\mathrm{m}$, ensuring the void is physically contained within the copper, as stated.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of Intact TSV Resistance\n\nThe TSV is modeled as two parallel conductors: the copper core and the barrier shell. Both have length $L$. We first determine their cross-sectional areas.\n\nThe barrier is a conformal layer of thickness $t$ inside a cylinder of radius $R$. Therefore, the copper core is a cylinder of radius $R_{\\mathrm{Cu}} = R-t$.\nThe cross-sectional area of the copper core, $A_{\\mathrm{Cu}}$, is:\n$$A_{\\mathrm{Cu}} = \\pi (R-t)^2$$\nThe cross-sectional area of the barrier shell, $A_{\\mathrm{b}}$, is the area of the ring between radius $R-t$ and $R$:\n$$A_{\\mathrm{b}} = \\pi R^2 - \\pi (R-t)^2 = \\pi (R^2 - (R^2 - 2Rt + t^2)) = \\pi (2Rt - t^2)$$\nUsing the formula for axial resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{ax}} = \\frac{\\rho L}{A}$, the resistances of the copper core ($R_{\\mathrm{Cu,path}}$) and the barrier shell ($R_{\\mathrm{b,path}}$) are:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{Cu,path}} = \\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{Cu}} L}{A_{\\mathrm{Cu}}} = \\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{Cu}} L}{\\pi (R-t)^2}$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{b,path}} = \\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{b}} L}{A_{\\mathrm{b}}} = \\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{b}} L}{\\pi (2Rt - t^2)}$$\nThe equivalent resistance of the intact TSV, $R_{\\mathrm{eq, intact}}$, is found by combining these two resistances in parallel:\n$$\\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{eq, intact}}} = \\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{Cu,path}}} + \\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{b,path}}} = \\frac{\\pi (R-t)^2}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{Cu}} L} + \\frac{\\pi (2Rt - t^2)}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{b}} L}$$\nThus, the expression for the intact TSV resistance is:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{eq, intact}} = \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{L} \\left[ \\frac{(R-t)^2}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{Cu}}} + \\frac{2Rt - t^2}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{b}}} \\right] \\right)^{-1} = \\frac{L}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{(R-t)^2}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{Cu}}} + \\frac{2Rt - t^2}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{b}}} \\right)^{-1}$$\n\n### Derivation of Voided TSV Resistance\n\nIn the voided case, an axial cylindrical void of radius $r_{\\mathrm{v}}$ exists within the copper core. The barrier is unaffected.\nThe new cross-sectional area of the copper conductor, $A'_{\\mathrm{Cu}}$, is the area of the annulus between radii $r_{\\mathrm{v}}$ and $R-t$.\n$$A'_{\\mathrm{Cu}} = \\pi (R-t)^2 - \\pi r_{\\mathrm{v}}^2 = \\pi ((R-t)^2 - r_{\\mathrm{v}}^2)$$\nThe resistance of the voided copper path, $R'_{\\mathrm{Cu,path}}$, becomes:\n$$R'_{\\mathrm{Cu,path}} = \\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{Cu}} L}{A'_{\\mathrm{Cu}}} = \\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{Cu}} L}{\\pi ((R-t)^2 - r_{\\mathrm{v}}^2)}$$\nThe resistance of the barrier path, $R_{\\mathrm{b,path}}$, remains unchanged. The equivalent resistance of the voided TSV, $R_{\\mathrm{eq, voided}}$, is the parallel combination of $R'_{\\mathrm{Cu,path}}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{b,path}}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{eq, voided}}} = \\frac{1}{R'_{\\mathrm{Cu,path}}} + \\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{b,path}}} = \\frac{\\pi ((R-t)^2 - r_{\\mathrm{v}}^2)}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{Cu}} L} + \\frac{\\pi (2Rt - t^2)}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{b}} L}$$\nThe expression for the voided TSV resistance is:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{eq, voided}} = \\frac{L}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{(R-t)^2 - r_{\\mathrm{v}}^2}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{Cu}}} + \\frac{2Rt - t^2}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{b}}} \\right)^{-1}$$\n\n### Ratio of Resistances\n\nThe ratio of the voided resistance to the intact resistance is $\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{eq, voided}}}{R_{\\mathrm{eq, intact}}}$. Using the derived expressions:\n$$ \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{eq, voided}}}{R_{\\mathrm{eq, intact}}} = \\frac{\\frac{L}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{(R-t)^2 - r_{\\mathrm{v}}^2}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{Cu}}} + \\frac{2Rt - t^2}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{b}}} \\right)^{-1}}{\\frac{L}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{(R-t)^2}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{Cu}}} + \\frac{2Rt - t^2}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{b}}} \\right)^{-1}} $$\nThe term $\\frac{L}{\\pi}$ cancels, and inverting the fractions gives:\n$$ \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{eq, voided}}}{R_{\\mathrm{eq, intact}}} = \\frac{\\frac{(R-t)^2}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{Cu}}} + \\frac{2Rt - t^2}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{b}}}}{\\frac{(R-t)^2 - r_{\\mathrm{v}}^2}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{Cu}}} + \\frac{2Rt - t^2}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{b}}}} $$\nThis is the final symbolic expression for the ratio.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\n\nWe substitute the given values into the ratio expression.\n- $R = 5.0 \\times 10^{-6}$\n- $t = 5.0 \\times 10^{-8}$\n- $\\rho_{\\mathrm{Cu}} = 1.7 \\times 10^{-8}$\n- $\\rho_{\\mathrm{b}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-6}$\n- $r_{\\mathrm{v}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the geometric terms:\n- $R-t = 5.0 \\times 10^{-6} - 0.05 \\times 10^{-6} = 4.95 \\times 10^{-6}$\n- $(R-t)^2 = (4.95 \\times 10^{-6})^2 = 24.5025 \\times 10^{-12}$\n- $r_{\\mathrm{v}}^2 = (1.0 \\times 10^{-6})^2 = 1.0 \\times 10^{-12}$\n- $(R-t)^2 - r_{\\mathrm{v}}^2 = 24.5025 \\times 10^{-12} - 1.0 \\times 10^{-12} = 23.5025 \\times 10^{-12}$\n- $2Rt - t^2 = 2(5.0 \\times 10^{-6})(5.0 \\times 10^{-8}) - (5.0 \\times 10^{-8})^2 = 50 \\times 10^{-14} - 25 \\times 10^{-16} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-13} - 0.025 \\times 10^{-13} = 4.975 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\nNow, we compute the terms in the numerator and denominator of the ratio expression.\nLet the ratio be $K$.

The transmission of each bit is modeled as an independent Bernoulli trial, where the outcome is either an error (with probability $p$) or correct transmission (with probability $1-p$).

To find the number of bits $N$ required to achieve a desired confidence $C$ for a given threshold $p_t$, we solve this equation for $N$:\n$$\n1-C = (1-p_t)^N\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln(1-C) = \\ln((1-p_t)^N) = N \\ln(1-p_t)\n$$\n$$\nN = \\frac{\\ln(1-C)}{\\ln(1-p_t)}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nNext, we use this relation to compute the minimum required observation time. We are given the following values:\nConfidence level, $C = 0.999$.\nTarget BER threshold, $p_t = 10^{-12}$.\nLine rate, $R = 16\\,\\text{Gb/s} = 16 \\times 10^9\\,\\text{bits/s}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the required number of bits, $N$:\n$$\nN = \\frac{\\ln(1-0.999)}{\\ln(1-10^{-12})} = \\frac{\\ln(0.001)}{\\ln(1-10^{-12})}\n$$\nThe value of $p_t = 10^{-12}$ is extremely small. For $|x| \\ll 1$, the Taylor series expansion for the natural logarithm is $\\ln(1-x) \\approx -x - \\frac{x^2}{2} - \\dots$. Given that $x=p_t$ is on the order of $10^{-12}$, the first-order approximation $\\ln(1-p_t) \\approx -p_t$ is exceptionally accurate.\n$$\nN \\approx \\frac{\\ln(0.001)}{-p_t} = \\frac{\\ln(10^{-3})}{-10^{-12}} = \\frac{-3 \\ln(10)}{-10^{-12}} = 3 \\ln(10) \\times 10^{12}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the required observation time, $T$, by dividing the total number of bits $N$ by the line rate $R$:\n$$\nT = \\frac{N}{R} \\approx \\frac{3 \\ln(10) \\times 10^{12} \\text{ bits}}{16 \\times 10^9 \\text{ bits/s}}\n$$\n$$\nT \\approx \\frac{3 \\ln(10)}{16} \\times 10^{3} \\text{ s}\n$$\nUsing the numerical value $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.302585$:\n$$\nT \\approx \\frac{3 \\times 2.302585}{16} \\times 1000 \\text{ s} \\approx \\frac{6.907755}{16} \\times 1000 \\text{ s}\n$$\n$$\nT \\approx 0.4317346875 \\times 1000 \\text{ s} \\approx 431.7346875 \\text{ s}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nT \\approx 431.7 \\text{ s}\n$$",
