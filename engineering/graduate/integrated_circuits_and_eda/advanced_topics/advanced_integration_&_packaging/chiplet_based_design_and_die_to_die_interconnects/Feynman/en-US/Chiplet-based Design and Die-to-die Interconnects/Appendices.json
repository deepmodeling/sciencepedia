The assumptions of independence are standard for a first-order analysis. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary parameters and relationships to derive a unique analytical expression for the module yield.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative terms without ambiguity or subjective content.\n\nAll validation criteria are met. The problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A detailed solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe derivation of the overall module yield, $Y_{\\text{module}}$, proceeds by first determining the yield of a single chiplet, then the combined yield of all chiplets on the module, and finally incorporating the packaging yield.\n\n1.  **Area and Defect Rate of a Single Chiplet**\n    The total active silicon area for $N$ identical chiplets is $A$. Therefore, the active area of a single chiplet, denoted as $a_c$, is given by:\n    $$a_c = \\frac{A}{N}$$\n    According to the problem statement, the occurrence of defects follows a Poisson distribution. The mean number of defects, $\\lambda_c$, in the area of a single chiplet $a_c$ is:\n    $$\\lambda_c = D \\cdot a_c = D \\frac{A}{N}$$\n\n2.  **Yield of a Single Chiplet ($Y_{\\text{chiplet}}$)**\n    A chiplet is considered functional if and only if it contains zero defects. The probability of observing $k$ defects in an area with a mean of $\\lambda_c$ defects is given by the Poisson probability mass function:\n    $$P(K=k) = \\frac{\\lambda_c^k \\exp(-\\lambda_c)}{k!}$$\n    The yield of a single chiplet, $Y_{\\text{chiplet}}$, is the probability of having exactly zero defects ($k=0$):\n    $$Y_{\\text{chiplet}} = P(K=0) = \\frac{\\lambda_c^0 \\exp(-\\lambda_c)}{0!}$$\n    Since $x^0 = 1$ and $0! = 1$, this simplifies to:\n    $$Y_{\\text{chiplet}} = \\exp(-\\lambda_c)$$\n    Substituting the expression for $\\lambda_c$:\n    $$Y_{\\text{chiplet}} = \\exp\\left(-D \\frac{A}{N}\\right)$$\n\n3.  **Combined Silicon Yield of All Chiplets ($Y_{\\text{silicon}}$)**\n    For the multi-chip module to be functional from a silicon perspective, all $N$ chiplets must be functional. The problem states that defects across chiplets occur independently. Therefore, the probability that all $N$ chiplets are functional is the product of their individual yields.\n    $$Y_{\\text{silicon}} = (Y_{\\text{chiplet}})^N$$\n    Substituting the expression for $Y_{\\text{chiplet}}$:\n    $$Y_{\\text{silicon}} = \\left( \\exp\\left(-D \\frac{A}{N}\\right) \\right)^N$$\n    Using the property of exponents $(x^a)^b = x^{ab}$, the expression simplifies to:\n    $$Y_{\\text{silicon}} = \\exp\\left(-D \\frac{A}{N} \\cdot N\\right) = \\exp(-DA)$$\n    This result indicates that, under the simple Poisson model, the total silicon yield is independent of the number of partitions $N$ and is equivalent to the yield of a single monolithic die of area $A$.\n\n4.  **Overall Module Yield ($Y_{\\text{module}}$)**\n    The final module yield, $Y_{\\text{module}}$, requires both the silicon components to be functional and the packaging process to be successful. The problem states that packaging success, with probability $Y_p$, is independent of silicon defects. Therefore, the overall module yield is the product of the combined silicon yield and the packaging yield.\n    $$Y_{\\text{module}} = Y_{\\text{silicon}} \\cdot Y_p$$\n    Substituting the derived expression for $Y_{\\text{silicon}}$:\n    $$Y_{\\text{module}} = \\exp(-DA) \\cdot Y_p$$\n    This is the final closed-form analytic expression for the overall module yield. It is a function of the given parameters $D$, $A$, and $Y_p$. While the derivation explicitly uses $N$, the parameter cancels out, so the final yield value is independent of $N$ under the specified model conditions. The expression is still considered a function of $N$ in a broader mathematical sense, albeit one where its partial derivative with respect to $N$ is zero.\n\nThe final expression is:\n$$Y_{\\text{module}} = Y_p \\exp(-DA)$$",

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of integrated circuit design and digital communication, well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient data, and expressed in objective, unambiguous language. All provided parameters, such as bump pitch ($p = 35\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$) and line rate ($R = 56\\ \\mathrm{Gb/s}$), are realistic for modern die-to-die interconnect technologies. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions. I will now proceed with a reasoned solution derived from fundamental principles.\n\nThe objective is to determine the aggregate bandwidth per millimeter of die edge, which we will denote as $B_{agg/L}$. This quantity represents a bandwidth density. It can be found by first calculating the spatial density of the communication lanes and then multiplying by the effective data throughput of each individual lane.\n\nFirst, let us define the linear density of signal lanes, $\\lambda_{lane}$. The problem states that the micro-bumps are placed with a uniform center-to-center spacing, or pitch, of $p$. It is also given that each high-speed lane uses exactly one signal bump. Therefore, the pitch $p$ is the distance allocated to a single lane along the die edge. The number of lanes that can be placed per unit length is the reciprocal of this pitch.\n$$ \\lambda_{lane} = \\frac{1}{p} $$\nThe units of $\\lambda_{lane}$ will be lanes per unit length, e.g., lanes/m if $p$ is in meters.\n\nSecond, let us determine the effective data throughput of a single lane, denoted as $T_{lane}$. The problem provides the raw line rate $R$, which is the total number of bits transmitted per second, regardless of their content (i.e., data, encoding, or overhead). The problem also provides a long-term effective utilization factor, $\\eta$, which accounts for all protocol and implementation overheads. This dimensionless factor represents the fraction of the raw line rate that corresponds to useful data payload. The effective throughput of one lane is therefore the product of the raw line rate and the utilization factor.\n$$ T_{lane} = R \\times \\eta $$\nThe units of $T_{lane}$ will be effective bits per second.\n\nThird, to find the aggregate bandwidth per unit length of the die edge, $B_{agg/L}$, we combine these two fundamental quantities. This is achieved by multiplying the number of lanes per unit length by the effective throughput per lane.\n$$ B_{agg/L} = \\lambda_{lane} \\times T_{lane} $$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above, we obtain the general formula:\n$$ B_{agg/L} = \\left(\\frac{1}{p}\\right) \\times (R \\eta) = \\frac{R\\eta}{p} $$\n\nNow, we will substitute the given numerical values into this expression. The given parameters are:\n- Pitch, $p = 35\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n- Raw line rate, $R = 56\\ \\mathrm{Gb/s}$\n- Utilization factor, $\\eta = 0.90$\n\nTo ensure dimensional consistency and arrive at the desired final units of Tbit/s/mm, we must perform careful unit conversions. Let us first convert all quantities to a base set of units (meters, bits, seconds).\n- $p = 35\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} = 35 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- $R = 56\\ \\mathrm{Gb/s} = 56 \\times 10^9\\ \\mathrm{bits/s}$\n- $\\eta = 0.90$ (dimensionless)\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived expression:\n$$ B_{agg/L} = \\frac{(56 \\times 10^9\\ \\mathrm{bits/s}) \\times 0.90}{35 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}} $$\nFirst, we compute the numerator:\n$$ R \\times \\eta = 56 \\times 10^9 \\times 0.90\\ \\mathrm{bits/s} = 50.4 \\times 10^9\\ \\mathrm{bits/s} $$\nNow we perform the division:\n$$ B_{agg/L} = \\frac{50.4 \\times 10^9\\ \\mathrm{bits/s}}{35 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}} = \\left(\\frac{50.4}{35}\\right) \\times 10^{9 - (-6)}\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{bits}}{\\mathrm{s} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}} $$\n$$ B_{agg/L} = 1.44 \\times 10^{15}\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{bits}}{\\mathrm{s} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}} $$\nThe final step is to convert this result from bits per second per meter ($\\mathrm{bits}/\\mathrm{s}/\\mathrm{m}$) to terabits per second per millimeter ($\\mathrm{Tbit}/\\mathrm{s}/\\mathrm{mm}$). We use the following conversion factors:\n- $1\\ \\mathrm{Tbit} = 10^{12}\\ \\mathrm{bits}$\n- $1\\ \\mathrm{m} = 10^3\\ \\mathrm{mm}$\n$$ B_{agg/L} = 1.44 \\times 10^{15}\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{bits}}{\\mathrm{s} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}} \\times \\left(\\frac{1\\ \\mathrm{Tbit}}{10^{12}\\ \\mathrm{bits}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1\\ \\mathrm{m}}{10^3\\ \\mathrm{mm}}\\right) $$\n$$ B_{agg/L} = 1.44 \\times \\frac{10^{15}}{10^{12} \\times 10^3}\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{Tbit}}{\\mathrm{s} \\cdot \\mathrm{mm}} = 1.44 \\times \\frac{10^{15}}{10^{15}}\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{Tbit}}{\\mathrm{s} \\cdot \\mathrm{mm}} $$\n$$ B_{agg/L} = 1.44\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{Tbit}}{\\mathrm{s} \\cdot \\mathrm{mm}} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculation $50.4/35$ results in $1.44$ exactly. To express this with four significant figures, we append a zero.\n$$ B_{agg/L} = 1.440\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{Tbit}}{\\mathrm{s} \\cdot \\mathrm{mm}} $$\nThus, the aggregate bandwidth per millimeter of die edge is $1.440\\ \\mathrm{Tbit/s/mm}$.",
