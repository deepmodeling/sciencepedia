Their combined energy cost is given as a single value per column operation.\n$$ E_{\\text{periph\\_total}} = E_{\\text{periph}} $$\n\nThe total energy for a single column operation is the sum of these components:\n$$ E_{\\text{total\\_col}} = E_{\\text{DAC\\_total}} + E_{\\text{array\\_total}} + E_{\\text{ADC\\_total}} + E_{\\text{periph\\_total}} $$\n$$ E_{\\text{total\\_col}} = N \\cdot E_{\\text{DAC}} + N \\cdot E_{\\text{array}} + E_{\\text{ADC}} + E_{\\text{periph}} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the energy per effective $8$-bit MAC, which we denote as $E_{\\text{MAC\\_eff}}$. A single column operation performs $N$ parallel $8$-bit $\\times$ $8$-bit multiply-accumulate operations. Therefore, to find the effective energy per MAC, we must amortize the total column energy over the $N$ operations performed.\n$$ E_{\\text{MAC\\_eff}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{total\\_col}}}{N} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $E_{\\text{total\\_col}}$:\n$$ E_{\\text{MAC\\_eff}} = \\frac{N \\cdot E_{\\text{DAC}} + N \\cdot E_{\\text{array}} + E_{\\text{ADC}} + E_{\\text{periph}}}{N} $$\nThis expression can be simplified by distributing the division by $N$:\n$$ E_{\\text{MAC\\_eff}} = E_{\\text{DAC}} + E_{\\text{array}} + \\frac{E_{\\text{ADC}} + E_{\\text{periph}}}{N} $$\nThis final symbolic expression shows that the per-MAC energies of the DAC and array are direct costs, while the shared, column-level overheads of the ADC and peripherals are amortized across the $N$ parallel operations.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n- Number of rows per column: $N = 256$\n- DAC energy per activation: $E_{\\text{DAC}} = 0.2\\ \\text{pJ}$\n- Array energy per MAC: $E_{\\text{array}} = 0.05\\ \\text{pJ}$\n- ADC energy per conversion: $E_{\\text{ADC}} = 1\\ \\text{pJ}$\n- Peripheral energy per column operation: $E_{\\text{periph}} = 0.1\\ \\text{pJ}$\n\nPlugging these values into the derived formula for $E_{\\text{MAC\\_eff}}$:\n$$ E_{\\text{MAC\\_eff}} = 0.2 + 0.05 + \\frac{1 + 0.1}{256} $$\n$$ E_{\\text{MAC\\_eff}} = 0.25 + \\frac{1.1}{256} $$\nPerforming the division:\n$$ \\frac{1.1}{256} = 0.004296875 $$\nNow, completing the sum:\n$$ E_{\\text{MAC\\_eff}} = 0.25 + 0.004296875 = 0.254296875\\ \\text{pJ} $$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to six significant figures. The first six significant digits are $2, 5, 4, 2, 9, 6$. The seventh digit is $8$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the sixth digit.\n$$ E_{\\text{MAC\\_eff}} \\approx 0.254297\\ \\text{pJ} $$",
