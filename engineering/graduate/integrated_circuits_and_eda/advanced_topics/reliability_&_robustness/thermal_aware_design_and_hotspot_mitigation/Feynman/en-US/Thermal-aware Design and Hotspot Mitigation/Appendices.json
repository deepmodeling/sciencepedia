            "problem": "In Electronic Design Automation (EDA) for integrated circuits, thermal-aware design and hotspot mitigation frequently rely on equivalent thermal resistance abstractions to predict temperature rises caused by power dissipation. Consider a multilayer vertical stack representative of an integrated circuit die, thermal interface materials, and package layers. The stack comprises $N$ planar layers with uniform cross-sectional area $A$, where layer $i$ has thickness $d_i$ and thermal conductivity $k_i$. The stack is subject to steady-state, one-dimensional heat conduction along the thickness direction, with a constant heat rate $P$ flowing through the stack and a resulting temperature drop $\\Delta T$ between its two isothermal boundaries. Assume no internal heat generation within the layers, spatially uniform and temperature-independent $k_i$, perfect interfacial contact (no interfacial thermal resistances), and negligible radiation or convection so that thermal transport is purely by conduction within the solid stack.\n\nStarting only from fundamental laws of heat conduction and energy conservation, derive the equivalent thermal resistance $R_{\\theta}$ of the multilayer stack defined by the relation $\\Delta T = R_{\\theta} P$, expressed in terms of $N$, $\\{d_i\\}_{i=1}^{N}$, $\\{k_i\\}_{i=1}^{N}$, and $A$.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of heat transfer, well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient data, and formulated objectively. It represents a standard, formalizable problem in the thermal analysis of integrated circuits, a core topic in the specified field. All conditions are physically plausible within the context of a simplified model. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe derivation of the equivalent thermal resistance, $R_{\\theta}$, begins with the fundamental law of steady-state heat conduction, Fourier's Law. In one dimension, the heat flux, $q_x$, which is the rate of heat transfer per unit area, is proportional to the negative of the temperature gradient, $\\frac{dT}{dx}$. The constant of proportionality is the thermal conductivity, $k$.\n$$ q_x = -k \\frac{dT}{dx} $$\nThe total heat rate, $P$, flowing through a cross-sectional area $A$ perpendicular to the direction of heat flow is given by $P = q_x A$. Substituting this into Fourier's Law yields:\n$$ P = -k A \\frac{dT}{dx} $$\nThis equation governs heat transfer through a single homogeneous layer. To determine the thermal resistance of a single layer, we can rearrange and integrate this expression. Let us consider a single layer, $i$, with thickness $d_i$ and thermal conductivity $k_i$. The temperatures at its two faces are $T_{i, \\text{in}}$ and $T_{i, \\text{out}}$.\n$$ P \\, dx = -k_i A \\, dT $$\nIntegrating across the thickness of the layer, from position $x=0$ to $x=d_i$:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{d_i} P \\, dx = \\int_{T_{i, \\text{in}}}^{T_{i, \\text{out}}} -k_i A \\, dT $$\nThe problem states that $P$, $k_i$, and $A$ are constant. Therefore, they can be taken outside the integrals.\n$$ P \\int_{0}^{d_i} dx = -k_i A \\int_{T_{i, \\text{in}}}^{T_{i, \\text{out}}} dT $$\n$$ P [x]_{0}^{d_i} = -k_i A [T]_{T_{i, \\text{in}}}^{T_{i, \\text{out}}} $$\n$$ P d_i = -k_i A (T_{i, \\text{out}} - T_{i, \\text{in}}) $$\nThe temperature drop across layer $i$ is $\\Delta T_i = T_{i, \\text{in}} - T_{i, \\text{out}}$. Rearranging the equation in terms of this drop:\n$$ P d_i = k_i A (T_{i, \\text{in}} - T_{i, \\text{out}}) = k_i A \\Delta T_i $$\n$$ \\Delta T_i = P \\left( \\frac{d_i}{k_i A} \\right) $$\nBy analogy to Ohm's Law for electrical resistance ($\\Delta V = I R$), the thermal resistance of a single layer, $R_{\\theta,i}$, is defined by the relationship $\\Delta T_i = P R_{\\theta,i}$. From our derived expression, we can identify the thermal resistance of layer $i$ as:\n$$ R_{\\theta,i} = \\frac{d_i}{k_i A} $$\nNow, we consider the complete stack of $N$ layers. The problem specifies steady-state conditions and no internal heat generation. By the principle of energy conservation, the heat rate $P$ must be the same through each layer in the series stack. The total temperature drop across the entire stack, $\\Delta T$, is the sum of the individual temperature drops across each of the $N$ layers, because the layers are arranged in series thermally.\n$$ \\Delta T = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\Delta T_i $$\nSubstituting the expression for each $\\Delta T_i$:\n$$ \\Delta T = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (P R_{\\theta,i}) $$\nSince $P$ is constant throughout the stack, it can be factored out of the summation:\n$$ \\Delta T = P \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N} R_{\\theta,i} \\right) $$\nThe problem defines the equivalent thermal resistance of the entire stack, $R_{\\theta}$, by the relation $\\Delta T = R_{\\theta} P$. Comparing this definition with our derived equation, we see that the equivalent thermal resistance of the stack is the sum of the individual thermal resistances:\n$$ R_{\\theta} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} R_{\\theta,i} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $R_{\\theta,i}$:\n$$ R_{\\theta} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{d_i}{k_i A} $$\nSince the cross-sectional area $A$ is uniform for all layers, it is a constant with respect to the summation index $i$ and can be factored out:\n$$ R_{\\theta} = \\frac{1}{A} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{d_i}{k_i} $$\nThis is the final derived expression for the equivalent thermal resistance of the multilayer stack.\n\nFinally, we verify the units consistency. The SI units for the given quantities are:\n- Thickness $d_i$: meters, [m]\n- Thermal conductivity $k_i$: Watts per meter-Kelvin, [W/(m$\\cdot$K)]\n- Area $A$: square meters, [m$^2$]\n\nThe units of the term inside the summation, $\\frac{d_i}{k_i}$, are:\n$$ \\left[\\frac{d_i}{k_i}\\right] = \\frac{[\\text{m}]}{[\\text{W}/(\\text{m}\\cdot\\text{K})]} = \\frac{[\\text{m}^2 \\cdot \\text{K}]}{[\\text{W}]} $$\nThe summation itself does not change the units. Now, we include the pre-factor $\\frac{1}{A}$:\n$$ [R_{\\theta}] = \\left[\\frac{1}{A}\\right] \\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{d_i}{k_i}\\right] = \\frac{1}{[\\text{m}^2]} \\cdot \\frac{[\\text{m}^2 \\cdot \\text{K}]}{[\\text{W}]} $$\nThe units of [m$^2$] cancel out, leaving:\n$$ [R_{\\theta}] = \\frac{[\\text{K}]}{[\\text{W}]} $$\nThis corresponds to Kelvin per Watt ($\\mathrm{K/W}$), which are the correct units for thermal resistance as specified in the problem statement.

We proceed to the solution.\n\n**Derivation of the Governing Differential Equation**\nThe thermal behavior of the lumped model is governed by the principle of energy conservation. The rate of change of stored thermal energy in the thermal capacitance, $C_{th}$, must equal the net power flowing into the system. The stored energy is $E_{th}(t) = C_{th} T(t)$, so its rate of change is $\\frac{dE_{th}}{dt} = C_{th}\\frac{dT(t)}{dt}$. The net power is the difference between the power dissipated by the IC, $P(t)$, and the heat flow to the ambient environment through the thermal resistance, $R_{th}$. This heat flow is given by $\\frac{T(t) - T_{\\mathrm{amb}}}{R_{th}}$.\n\nThe energy balance equation is:\n$$\nC_{th} \\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = P(t) - \\frac{T(t) - T_{\\mathrm{amb}}}{R_{th}}\n$$\nUsing the definition of temperature rise, $\\theta(t) = T(t) - T_{\\mathrm{amb}}$, and noting that $T_{\\mathrm{amb}}$ is constant, we have $\\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = \\frac{d\\theta(t)}{dt}$. Substituting these into the balance equation yields:\n$$\nC_{th} \\frac{d\\theta(t)}{dt} = P(t) - \\frac{\\theta(t)}{R_{th}}\n$$\nRearranging this into the standard form for a first-order linear ordinary differential equation gives:\n$$\nR_{th} C_{th} \\frac{d\\theta(t)}{dt} + \\theta(t) = R_{th} P(t)\n$$\nDefining the thermal time constant as $\\tau_{th} = R_{th} C_{th}$, the dynamical equation relating $\\theta(t)$ and $P(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\tau_{th} \\frac{d\\theta(t)}{dt} + \\theta(t) = R_{th} P(t)\n$$\nThis equation describes an LTI system. The output $\\theta(t)$ can be found by convolving the input $P(t)$ with the system's impulse response, $h(t)$: $\\theta(t) = (P * h)(t)$. For a causal LTI system, the impulse response is the time derivative of the step response: $h(t) = \\frac{d\\theta_s(t)}{dt}$.\n\n**Identification of the Impulse Response**\nThe problem provides the step response, $\\theta_s(t)$, for a $1\\,\\mathrm{W}$ step in power:\n$$\n\\theta_s(t) = 12 (1 - \\exp(-t/0.15)) u(t)\n$$\nwhere $u(t)$ is the Heaviside step function. All quantities are in base SI units ($\\mathrm{K}$, $\\mathrm{s}$, $\\mathrm{W}$). By comparing this to the general solution for a step input $P(t) = P_0 u(t)$, which is $\\theta(t) = R_{th} P_0 (1 - \\exp(-t/\\tau_{th}))$, we identify the thermal resistance, $R_{th} = 12\\,\\mathrm{K/W}$, and the thermal time constant, $\\tau_{th} = 0.15\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nTo find the impulse response $h(t)$, we differentiate $\\theta_s(t)$:\n$$\nh(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left[ 12 (1 - \\exp(-t/0.15)) u(t) \\right]\n$$\nUsing the product rule for differentiation, $\\frac{d}{dt}(f(t)u(t)) = f'(t)u(t) + f(t)\\delta(t)$, where $\\delta(t)$ is the Dirac delta function. Let $f(t) = 12(1-\\exp(-t/0.15))$. At $t=0$, $f(0) = 12(1-1) = 0$, so the term $f(t)\\delta(t)$ vanishes. The derivative $f'(t)$ is:\n$$\nf'(t) = 12 \\left( - \\left(-\\frac{1}{0.15}\\right) \\exp(-t/0.15) \\right) = \\frac{12}{0.15} \\exp(-t/0.15) = 80 \\exp(-t/0.15)\n$$\nThus, the impulse response is:\n$$\nh(t) = 80 \\exp(-t/0.15) u(t) \\quad [\\mathrm{K/W}]\n$$\n\n**Calculation of the Temperature Response**\nThe given power profile $P(t)$ is a piecewise-constant function. It can be expressed as a superposition of scaled and time-shifted Heaviside step functions $u(t)$:\n$$\nP(t) = 0.8 u(t) + (1.5 - 0.8) u(t - 0.1) + (0.5 - 1.5) u(t - 0.25)\n$$\n$$\nP(t) = 0.8 u(t) + 0.7 u(t - 0.1) - 1.0 u(t - 0.25) \\quad [\\mathrm{W}]\n$$\nSince the system is LTI, the total temperature rise $\\theta(t)$ is the superposition of the responses to each step component. The response to a step of magnitude $A$ at time $t_0$ is $A \\cdot \\theta_s(t-t_0)$.\n$$\n\\theta(t) = 0.8\\, \\theta_s(t) + 0.7\\, \\theta_s(t - 0.1) - 1.0\\, \\theta_s(t - 0.25)\n$$\nWe need to evaluate the temperature at $t = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{s}$.

All delays will be in picoseconds ($\\mathrm{ps}$).\n\nFor stage $1$:\n$s_1 = 0.62\\,\\mathrm{ps/K}$, $c_1 = 0.012\\,\\mathrm{ps/K^{2}}$, $\\Delta T_1 = 17\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n$$\\Delta d_1 = (0.62)(17) + \\frac{1}{2}(0.012)(17)^2 = 10.54 + (0.006)(289) = 10.54 + 1.734 = 12.274\\,\\mathrm{ps}$$\n\nFor stage $2$:\n$s_2 = 0.77\\,\\mathrm{ps/K}$, $c_2 = 0.008\\,\\mathrm{ps/K^{2}}$, $\\Delta T_2 = 14\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n$$\\Delta d_2 = (0.77)(14) + \\frac{1}{2}(0.008)(14)^2 = 10.78 + (0.004)(196) = 10.78 + 0.784 = 11.564\\,\\mathrm{ps}$$\n\nFor stage $3$:\n$s_3 = 0.54\\,\\mathrm{ps/K}$, $c_3 = 0.010\\,\\mathrm{ps/K^{2}}$, $\\Delta T_3 = 11\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n$$\\Delta d_3 = (0.54)(11) + \\frac{1}{2}(0.010)(11)^2 = 5.94 + (0.005)(121) = 5.94 + 0.605 = 6.545\\,\\mathrm{ps}$$\n\nFor stage $4$:\n$s_4 = 0.09\\,\\mathrm{ps/K}$, $c_4 = 0.001\\,\\mathrm{ps/K^{2}}$, $\\Delta T_4 = 15\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n$$\\Delta d_4 = (0.09)(15) + \\frac{1}{2}(0.001)(15)^2 = 1.35 + (0.0005)(225) = 1.35 + 0.1125 = 1.4625\\,\\mathrm{ps}$$\n\nThe total timing guardband $\\Delta D$ is the sum of these individual delay increases:\n$$\\Delta D = \\Delta d_1 + \\Delta d_2 + \\Delta d_3 + \\Delta d_4$$\n$$\\Delta D = 12.274 + 11.564 + 6.545 + 1.4625 = 31.8455\\,\\mathrm{ps}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The fifth significant figure is a $5$, so we round up.\n$$\\Delta D \\approx 31.85\\,\\mathrm{ps}$$\nThis is the total additional delay, or guardband, that must be added to the path's signoff timing budget to ensure correct operation under the specified worst-case thermal conditions.",
