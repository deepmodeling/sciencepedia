It is a standard problem in sensor electronics that can be solved using first principles of noise analysis in linear time-invariant (LTI) systems.\n\nThe Noise-Equivalent Temperature (NET) is defined as the temperature change that produces a sensor output voltage change equal to the root-mean-square (RMS) noise voltage, $\\sigma_V$, at the output. The sensor's sensitivity is given as a constant, $K_T = \\partial V/\\partial T$. Thus, a temperature change $\\Delta T$ produces a voltage change $\\Delta V = K_T \\Delta T$.

The integral becomes:\n$$\n\\sigma_V^2 = S_v \\cdot B\n$$\nThe RMS voltage noise is the square root of this value:\n$$\n\\sigma_V = \\sqrt{S_v \\cdot B}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for NET:\n$$\n\\text{NET} = \\frac{\\sqrt{S_v \\cdot B}}{\\partial V/\\partial T}\n$$\nNow, we evaluate this numerically with the given values:\n$S_v = 1.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{V}^2/\\mathrm{Hz}$\n$B = 1.0 \\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$\n$\\partial V/\\partial T = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{V}/\\mathrm{K}$\n\nFirst, calculate the mean-square noise voltage:\n$$\n\\sigma_V^2 = (1.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{V}^2/\\mathrm{Hz}) \\cdot (1.0 \\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{Hz}) = 1.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{V}^2\n$$\nThe RMS noise voltage is:\n$$\n\\sigma_V = \\sqrt{1.0 \\times 10^{-9}}\\ \\mathrm{V} \\approx 3.162277... \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{V}\n$$\nFinally, calculate the NET:\n$$\n\\text{NET} = \\frac{3.162277... \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{V}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{V}/\\mathrm{K}} \\approx 0.3162277...\\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the NET is $0.316\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n\n**Part 2: Uniform Time Averaging**\n\nHere, the noise is passed through a uniform averaging filter. The problem statement requires the derivation to start from the definition of mean-square noise as the integral of the input PSD weighted by the squared magnitude of the filter's frequency response, $|H(f)|^2$.\nThe output mean-square noise, $\\sigma_{V, \\text{avg}}^2$, is given by:\n$$\n\\sigma_{V, \\text{avg}}^2 = \\int_0^\\infty S_v |H(f)|^2 \\, df\n$$\nSince $S_v$ is constant, this is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{V, \\text{avg}}^2 = S_v \\int_0^\\infty |H(f)|^2 \\, df\n$$\nThe integral term is the filter's noise-equivalent bandwidth, $B_n$. To find it, we first need the filter's frequency response $H(f)$, which is the Fourier transform of its impulse response $h(t)$.

Using Parseval's theorem is an efficient way to do this. The theorem states that the energy in the time domain equals the energy in the frequency domain:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h(t)|^2 \\, dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |H(f)|^2 \\, df\n$$\nCalculating the time-domain integral:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h(t)|^2 \\, dt = \\int_0^\\tau \\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau}\\right)^2 dt = \\frac{1}{\\tau^2} [t]_0^\\tau = \\frac{1}{\\tau^2} \\cdot \\tau = \\frac{1}{\\tau}\n$$\nThus, $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |H(f)|^2 \\, df = 1/\\tau$. Since $|H(f)|^2$ is an even function of $f$, the integral from $0$ to $\\infty$ is half of the integral from $-\\infty$ to $\\infty$:\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty |H(f)|^2 \\, df = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |H(f)|^2 \\, df = \\frac{1}{2\\tau}\n$$\nThis is the noise-equivalent bandwidth $B_n$ of the averaging filter. The output mean-square noise is therefore:\n$$\n\\sigma_{V, \\text{avg}}^2 = S_v \\cdot B_n = \\frac{S_v}{2\\tau}\n$$\nThe RMS noise voltage is $\\sigma_{V, \\text{avg}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{S_v}{2\\tau}}$.

To ensure the sensor accuracy is met, the output deviation must not exceed this limit: $\\Delta V_{\\text{out}} \\le \\Delta V_{\\text{allow}}$.\n\nTherefore, we must find the minimum total $PSRR$, which we will call $PSRR_{\\text{total}}$, required to attenuate the supply ripple $\\Delta V_{DD}$ down to at most $\\Delta V_{\\text{allow}}$ at the output.\n$$\nPSRR_{\\text{total}} \\ge \\frac{\\Delta V_{DD}}{\\Delta V_{\\text{allow}}}\n$$\nThe given values are:\n- Allowed ripple-induced bandgap deviation: $\\Delta V_{\\text{allow}} = 100\\ \\mathrm{\\mu V} = 100 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{V} = 1 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{V}$.\n- Supply ripple amplitude: $\\Delta V_{DD} = 50\\ \\mathrm{mV} = 50 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{V}$.\n\nThe minimum required $PSRR$ as a linear ratio is:\n$$\nPSRR_{\\text{total, ratio}} = \\frac{50 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{V}}{1 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{V}} = 500\n$$\nTo express this in decibels:\n$$\nPSRR_{\\text{total, dB}} = 20 \\log_{10}(500) = 20 \\log_{10}(5 \\times 10^2) = 20 (\\log_{10}(5) + \\log_{10}(10^2)) = 20 (\\log_{10}(5) + 2)\n$$\nUsing a calculator, $20 \\log_{10}(500) \\approx 53.9794\\ \\mathrm{dB}$.\nRounding to four significant figures, the minimum required overall $PSRR$ is $53.98\\ \\mathrm{dB}$.\n\nPart 2: Minimum Resistor-Capacitor Time Constant ($\\tau$)\n\nThe overall PSRR is achieved through a cascade of two stages: the passive RC decoupling network and the active bandgap circuit. The total rejection (as a ratio) is the product of the rejection of each stage. In decibels, this corresponds to the sum of the rejections of each stage.\n$$\nPSRR_{\\mathrm{total, dB}} = PSRR_{\\mathrm{filt, dB}} + PSRR_{\\mathrm{bg, dB}}\n$$\nHere, $PSRR_{\\mathrm{filt, dB}}$ is the rejection provided by the RC filter, and $PSRR_{\\mathrm{bg, dB}}$ is the intrinsic rejection of the bandgap circuit itself.\n\nWe are given the intrinsic bandgap PSRR at the ripple frequency $f_r$:\n$$\nPSRR_{\\mathrm{bg, dB}} = 40\\ \\mathrm{dB}\n$$\nThe RC filter must therefore provide the remaining required rejection:\n$$\nPSRR_{\\mathrm{filt, dB}} = PSRR_{\\mathrm{total, dB}} - PSRR_{\\mathrm{bg, dB}} = 53.9794\\ \\mathrm{dB} - 40\\ \\mathrm{dB} = 13.9794\\ \\mathrm{dB}\n$$\nTo find the time constant $\\tau$, we must relate this required rejection to the filter's transfer function.

We can also derive this directly from the ratios: $PSRR_{\\text{total, ratio}} = 500$, and $PSRR_{\\mathrm{bg, ratio}} = 10^{(40/20)} = 10^2 = 100$.

At $t=0$, the frequency is $f_0$ and the threshold voltage is the initial value $V_{T0}$.\n$$f_{0} = f(0) = K \\left(1 - \\frac{V_{T0}}{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}\\right)$$\nFrom this, we can solve for $K$:\n$$K = \\frac{f_{0}}{1 - \\frac{V_{T0}}{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}} = f_{0} \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}{V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{T0}}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $K$ back into the time-dependent frequency equation:\n$$f(t) = \\left(f_{0} \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}{V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{T0}}\\right) \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{T}(t)}{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}$$\n$$f(t) = f_{0} \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{T}(t)}{V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{T0}}$$\nThe problem specifies that the threshold voltage drifts over time due to Bias Temperature Instability (BTI) according to the model $V_{T}(t) = V_{T0} + \\Delta V_{T}(t)$, where the drift is given by $\\Delta V_{T}(t) = A t^{n}$.\nSubstituting this full expression for $V_{T}(t)$ into our frequency equation gives the final desired relationship:\n$$f(t) = f_{0} \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - (V_{T0} + A t^{n})}{V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{T0}}$$\nThis equation expresses the ring oscillator frequency $f(t)$ as a function of the initial frequency $f_0$, device and operating parameters ($V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$, $V_{T0}$), and BTI aging parameters ($A$, $n$, $t$).\n\nNext, we perform the numerical evaluation using the provided parameters:\n- $V_{\\mathrm{DD}} = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n- $V_{T0} = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n- $f_{0} = 1.000 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{MHz} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$\n- $A = 1.195 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-n}$\n- $n = 0.2$\n- $t = 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the threshold voltage shift $\\Delta V_{T}$ at $t = 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{s}$:\n$$\\Delta V_{T}(10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{s}) = A t^{n} = (1.195 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times (10^{7})^{0.2}$$\nThe time-dependent term is $(10^{7})^{0.2} = (10^{7})^{1/5} = 10^{7/5} = 10^{1.4}$.\n$$10^{1.4} \\approx 25.11886$$\n$$\\Delta V_{T}(10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{s}) = (1.195 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times 25.11886 \\approx 0.0300175\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nNow, we calculate the aged threshold voltage $V_{T}(t)$:\n$$V_{T}(10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{s}) = V_{T0} + \\Delta V_{T}(10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{s}) = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{V} + 0.0300175\\,\\mathrm{V} = 0.2800175\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nFinally, we compute the aged a frequency $f(t)$ using the derived formula:\n$$f(10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{s}) = f_{0} \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{T}(10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{s})}{V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{T0}}$$\n$$f(10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{s}) = 1000\\,\\mathrm{MHz} \\times \\frac{0.8 - 0.2800175}{0.8 - 0.25}$$\n$$f(10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{s}) = 1000\\,\\mathrm{MHz} \\times \\frac{0.5199825}{0.55}$$\n$$f(10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\approx 1000\\,\\mathrm{MHz} \\times 0.9454227 \\approx 945.4227\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get $945.4\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$.\n\nFinally, a principled method to isolate BTI-induced aging effects from temperature variations involves a differential measurement scheme using co-located sensors. The method is as follows:\n1.  **Deploy a Sensor Pair**: Fabricate two identical ring oscillators (ROs) adjacent to each other on the silicon die. Their proximity ensures they experience the same local temperature.\n2.  **Differential Stress Application**:\n    - **Aged Sensor**: Operate one RO continuously under the specified stress conditions (e.g., nominal $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$). Its frequency, $f_{\\text{aged}}(t, T)$, will be a function of both aging time $t$ and temperature $T$.\n    - **Reference Sensor**: Operate the second RO in a way that minimizes aging. This can be achieved by keeping it powered down ($V_{\\mathrm{DD}}=0$) or in a minimum-stress bias state, and only activating it for very brief periods to perform a frequency measurement. The accumulated stress time for this sensor is negligible. Its frequency, $f_{\\text{ref}}(T)$, will therefore be a function of temperature only.\n3.  **Initial Calibration**: At time $t=0$, before significant aging occurs, characterize the frequency-temperature ($f-T$) response of both sensors. Since they are identical, their responses should match, i.e., $f_{\\text{aged}}(0, T) = f_{\\text{ref}}(T)$. This establishes a baseline calibration curve that maps a measured reference frequency to a specific temperature.\n4.  **In-Situ Monitoring and Decoupling**: During the lifetime of the chip, measure the frequencies of both sensors simultaneously.\n    - The measurement of $f_{\\text{ref}}(T)$ from the reference sensor provides an accurate, real-time reading of the local die temperature by using the pre-established calibration curve.\n    - The frequency of the aged sensor at the same temperature but without aging would be equal to the measured frequency of the reference sensor, $f_{\\text{ref}}(T)$.\n    - Therefore, the frequency degradation caused purely by BTI aging at that specific time and temperature can be calculated as the difference: $\\Delta f_{\\text{aging}}(t, T) = f_{\\text{aged}}(t, T) - f_{\\text{ref}}(T)$.\nThis differential technique effectively cancels the common-mode effect of temperature, isolating the signal of interest, which is the degradation due to aging.",
