            "problem": "In electrothermal co-simulation for integrated circuits (ICs) within Electronic Design Automation (EDA), compact thermal models often reduce complex heat spreading into lumped elements that are dynamically coupled to electrical power dissipation. Consider an IC hotspot modeled as a single lumped thermal resistance-capacitance (RC) network. The hotspot has thermal resistance $R_{th}$ (in $\\mathrm{K/W}$) to a fixed ambient at temperature $T_{\\mathrm{amb}}$ and a thermal capacitance $C_{th}$ (in $\\mathrm{J/K}$). Prior to $t=0$, no power is dissipated and the hotspot is at thermal equilibrium with the ambient. At $t=0$, the electrical co-simulator applies a step in dissipated power, modeled as $P(t) = P_{0} u(t)$, where $u(t)$ is the unit step and $P_{0}$ is a positive constant (in $\\mathrm{W}$).\n\nStarting from conservation of energy and the constitutive definitions of lumped thermal resistance and capacitance, derive the governing first-order differential equation for the hotspot temperature $T(t)$ relative to the ambient and solve it for $t \\ge 0$ subject to the initial condition $T(0)=T_{\\mathrm{amb}}$. Identify the thermal time constant of the system from your derivation. Express the final analytic expression for $T(t)$ in Kelvin.
