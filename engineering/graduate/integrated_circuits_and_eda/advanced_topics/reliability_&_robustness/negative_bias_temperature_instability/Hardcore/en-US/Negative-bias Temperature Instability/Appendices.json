The solution process will now proceed.\n\n---\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of an expression for the areal density of interface traps, $\\Delta D_{\\text{it}}$, from the measured threshold voltage shift, $|\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}|$. The derivation begins from fundamental electrostatic principles applied to the MOS structure.\n\nThe change in the threshold voltage, $\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}$, due to a change in the charge density at the silicon-oxide interface, $\\Delta Q_{\\text{it}}$, is given by the relation:\n$$\n\\Delta V_{\\text{th}} = - \\frac{\\Delta Q_{\\text{it}}}{C_{\\text{ox}}}\n$$\nHere, $C_{\\text{ox}}$ is the gate oxide capacitance per unit area. The negative sign indicates that a positive interface charge ($\\Delta Q_{\\text{it}}  0$), which is characteristic of NBTI in PMOSFETs, causes the threshold voltage to become more negative ($\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}  0$). The problem provides the magnitude of the threshold voltage shift, $|\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}|$. Since $\\Delta Q_{\\text{it}}$ and $C_{\\text{ox}}$ are both positive quantities, we can write:\n$$\n|\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}| = \\frac{\\Delta Q_{\\text{it}}}{C_{\\text{ox}}}\n$$\nThe gate oxide capacitance per unit area, $C_{\\text{ox}}$, is modeled as a parallel-plate capacitor:\n$$\nC_{\\text{ox}} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\text{ox}}}{t_{\\text{ox}}}\n$$\nwhere $t_{\\text{ox}}$ is the oxide thickness and $\\varepsilon_{\\text{ox}}$ is the permittivity of the gate dielectric (silicon dioxide). The permittivity $\\varepsilon_{\\text{ox}}$ is related to the vacuum permittivity $\\varepsilon_{0}$ and the relative permittivity $\\kappa_{\\text{ox}}$ by:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\text{ox}} = \\kappa_{\\text{ox}} \\varepsilon_{0}\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions for $C_{\\text{ox}}$ and $\\varepsilon_{\\text{ox}}$ into the equation for $|\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}|$ yields:\n$$\n|\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}| = \\frac{\\Delta Q_{\\text{it}}}{\\left(\\frac{\\kappa_{\\text{ox}} \\varepsilon_{0}}{t_{\\text{ox}}}\\right)} = \\frac{\\Delta Q_{\\text{it}} \\cdot t_{\\text{ox}}}{\\kappa_{\\text{ox}} \\varepsilon_{0}}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the areal density of charged interface traps, $\\Delta D_{\\text{it}}$, which has units of traps per unit area (e.g., $\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$). The problem states that the newly created traps are fully charged. Assuming each trap contributes a single elementary charge, $q$, the total interface charge density $\\Delta Q_{\\text{it}}$ is related to the trap density $\\Delta D_{\\text{it}}$ by:\n$$\n\\Delta Q_{\\text{it}} = q \\cdot \\Delta D_{\\text{it}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into our equation for $|\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}|$ gives:\n$$\n|\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}| = \\frac{(q \\cdot \\Delta D_{\\text{it}}) \\cdot t_{\\text{ox}}}{\\kappa_{\\text{ox}} \\varepsilon_{0}}\n$$\nWe now solve for $\\Delta D_{\\text{it}}$, which is the desired expression:\n$$\n\\Delta D_{\\text{it}} = \\frac{|\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}| \\cdot \\kappa_{\\text{ox}} \\varepsilon_{0}}{q \\cdot t_{\\text{ox}}}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation.

The rising delay of a CMOS gate is determined by how quickly the pull-up PMOS transistor can charge the load capacitance. The strength of the PMOS transistor, and thus its ability to supply charging current, is principally governed by its gate overdrive voltage, which is the difference between the supply voltage and its threshold voltage magnitude. When NBTI causes the threshold voltage magnitude to increase, the gate overdrive voltage for the PMOS transistor decreases. According to the current model, this reduced overdrive leads to a weaker, or smaller, pull-up current. Since the load capacitance remains constant, this weaker current takes a longer time to charge the output node to the required logic-high voltage level, thereby directly increasing the rising propagation delay.",

A thermally activated process following an Arrhenius law, described by $\\exp(-E_a / (k_{\\mathrm{B}}T))$, where $E_a$ is the activation energy, $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nCombining these components multiplicatively, the full model equation is:\n$$\n\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{th}}(t, T, V_g; A, n, E_a, \\gamma) = A \\cdot t^n \\cdot \\exp(\\gamma \\lvert V_g \\rvert) \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right)\n$$\nThis can be written more compactly by combining the exponential terms:\n$$\n\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{th}} = A \\cdot t^n \\cdot \\exp\\left(\\gamma \\lvert V_g \\rvert - \\frac{E_a}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right)\n$$\nThe model has four parameters to be calibrated: $\\boldsymbol{p} = (A, n, E_a, \\gamma)$. The value for the Boltzmann constant is given as $k_{\\mathrm{B}} = 8.617333262 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{eV/K}$.\n\nThe calibration process involves finding the optimal set of parameters $\\boldsymbol{p}_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ that minimizes the sum of squared residuals (SSR) between the measured data points ($\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{th}, i}^{\\mathrm{meas}}$) and the values predicted by the model ($\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{th}, i}^{\\mathrm{model}}$). For a given dataset with $N$ data points, the objective is to minimize:\n$$\n\\mathrm{SSR}(\\boldsymbol{p}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left( \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{th}, i}^{\\mathrm{meas}} - \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{th}, i}^{\\mathrm{model}}(t_i, T_i, V_{g,i}; \\boldsymbol{p}) \\right)^2\n$$\nThis minimization is performed using a nonlinear least-squares algorithm, subject to the specified bound constraints on the parameters:\n-   $A \\in [10^{-6}, 1]$\n-   $n \\in [0.01, 0.5]$\n-   $E_a \\in [0.05, 0.5]\\ \\mathrm{eV}$\n-   $\\gamma \\in [0, 3]\\ \\mathrm{V}^{-1}$\n\nThe optimization is initialized from a single starting point for each dataset:\n-   $\\boldsymbol{p}_0 = (A_0, n_0, E_{a0}, \\gamma_0) = (0.02, 0.20, 0.15, 1.50)$\n\nThis procedure is applied independently to each of the three datasets. For each dataset, all its constituent stress conditions and time points are aggregated and used collectively in the fitting process to determine a single set of optimal parameters.\n\nAfter the optimal parameters $\\boldsymbol{p}_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ are found for a dataset, the Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) is calculated to quantify the average deviation between the model and the data. The RMSE is defined as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left(\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{th}, i}^{\\mathrm{meas}} - \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{th}, i}^{\\mathrm{model}}(\\boldsymbol{p}_{\\mathrm{opt}})\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mathrm{SSR}(\\boldsymbol{p}_{\\mathrm{opt}})}{N}}\n$$\nwhere $N$ is the total number of data points in the dataset.\n\nThe implementation will consist of a program that, for each dataset:\n1.  Collects all stress conditions ($T, V_g, t$) and corresponding measured $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{th}}$ values.\n2.  Executes a bounded nonlinear least-squares optimization to find the parameters $(A, n, E_a, \\gamma)$.\n3.  Uses the calibrated parameters to compute the RMSE over all points in that dataset.\n4.  Finally, reports the computed RMSE values for the three datasets, rounded to six decimal places.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import least_squares\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calibrates an NBTI model and calculates RMSE for three datasets.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the Boltzmann constant in eV/K\n    K_B = 8.617333262e-5\n\n    # Define the three datasets from the problem description.\n    # Each dataset is a list of conditions.\n    # Each condition is a tuple: (T_K, Vg_V, t_s_array, dVth_V_array)\n    datasets = [\n        # Dataset 1\n        [\n            (398, -1.2, np.array([10, 100, 1000, 10000]), np.array([0.00610, 0.00954, 0.01540, 0.02420])),\n            (358, -1.0, np.array([10, 100, 1000, 10000]), np.array([0.00280, 0.00436, 0.00690, 0.01090])),\n            (298, -0.8, np.array([10, 100, 1000, 10000]), np.array([0.00080, 0.00120, 0.00195, 0.00300])),\n        ],\n        # Dataset 2\n        [\n            (298, 0.0, np.array([1, 10, 100, 1000]), np.array([0.000150, 0.000225, 0.000370, 0.000580])),\n            (298, -0.5, np.array([1, 10, 100, 1000]), np.array([0.000310, 0.000480, 0.000770, 0.001200])),\n            (338, -0.8, np.array([1, 10, 100, 1000]), np.array([0.000980, 0.001520, 0.002450, 0.003840])),\n        ],\n        # Dataset 3\n        [\n            (423, -1.5, np.array([10, 100, 1000, 20000]), np.array([0.01240, 0.02200, 0.03110, 0.05650])),\n            (373, -1.4, np.array([10, 100, 1000, 20000]), np.array([0.00610, 0.00970, 0.01520, 0.02780])),\n            (333, -1.0, np.array([10, 100, 1000, 20000]), np.array([0.001900, 0.003050, 0.004800, 0.008740])),\n        ]\n    ]\n\n    # Model definition: dVth = A * t^n * exp(gamma*|Vg| - Ea/(kB*T))\n    def delta_vth_model(params, T, Vg, t):\n        A, n, Ea, gamma = params\n        return A * (t**n) * np.exp(gamma * np.abs(Vg) - Ea / (K_B * T))\n\n    # Residuals function for the least-squares solver\n    def residuals(params, T_flat, Vg_flat, t_flat, vth_meas_flat):\n        vth_model_flat = delta_vth_model(params, T_flat, Vg_flat, t_flat)\n        return vth_model_flat - vth_meas_flat\n\n    # Calibration settings\n    initial_guess = (0.02, 0.20, 0.15, 1.50)\n    bounds = (\n        [1e-6, 0.01, 0.05, 0.0],    # Lower bounds for (A, n, Ea, gamma)\n        [1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 3.0]       # Upper bounds for (A, n, Ea, gamma)\n    )\n\n    results_rmse = []\n\n    for dataset in datasets:\n        # Flatten the dataset for processing\n        T_flat, Vg_flat, t_flat, vth_meas_flat = [], [], [], []\n        for T_K, Vg_V, t_s_array, dVth_V_array in dataset:\n            num_points = len(t_s_array)\n            T_flat.extend([T_K] * num_points)\n            Vg_flat.extend([Vg_V] * num_points)\n            t_flat.extend(t_s_array)\n            vth_meas_flat.extend(dVth_V_array)\n        \n        T_flat = np.array(T_flat)\n        Vg_flat = np.array(Vg_flat)\n        t_flat = np.array(t_flat)\n        vth_meas_flat = np.array(vth_meas_flat)\n\n        # Perform the nonlinear least-squares optimization\n        opt_result = least_squares(\n            residuals,\n            initial_guess,\n            bounds=bounds,\n            args=(T_flat, Vg_flat, t_flat, vth_meas_flat)\n        )\n        \n        # Extract optimal parameters\n        p_opt = opt_result.x\n        \n        # Calculate final residuals with optimal parameters\n        final_residuals = residuals(p_opt, T_flat, Vg_flat, t_flat, vth_meas_flat)\n        \n        # Calculate RMSE\n        num_total_points = len(vth_meas_flat)\n        rmse = np.sqrt(np.sum(final_residuals**2) / num_total_points)\n        \n        # Round to six decimal places and store\n        results_rmse.append(round(rmse, 6))\n\n    # Print the final result in the specified format\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results_rmse))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```",
