The track has Linear Energy Transfer (LET), defined here as the energy deposited per unit path length per unit mass density, equal to $L$. The silicon mass density is $\\rho$, and the average energy required to create one electron-hole pair in silicon is $\\varepsilon$. Assume the following:\n- The electric field in the depletion region is sufficiently strong that all electron-hole pairs generated within the depletion region are collected with unit efficiency and negligible recombination.\n- The energy deposition along the segment of length $x$ inside the depletion region is uniform and entirely local (no energy escapes via delta rays).\n- Energy-to-charge conversion is uniform, so that the number of electron-hole pairs generated equals the deposited energy divided by $\\varepsilon$.\n- Ignore any contribution from carrier diffusion outside the depletion region and any plasma or field collapse effects.\n\nStarting from the definitions of Linear Energy Transfer and charge collection in a depletion region, derive an expression for the total collected charge $Q$ at the diode terminals due to this single ion track.

The concepts of a $p$-$n$ junction, depletion region, Linear Energy Transfer (LET), electron-hole pair generation, and charge collection are fundamental principles in solid-state physics and radiation effects engineering. The definition of LET provided, while sometimes referred to as mass stopping power, is a valid and commonly used quantity in this field. All assumptions, such as unit collection efficiency and ignoring secondary effects, are standard for a first-order approximation. The problem is free of pseudoscience and factual errors.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It asks for a single quantity, the total collected charge $Q$, and provides all the necessary variables ($L$, $x$, $\\rho$, $\\varepsilon$, $q$) and a clear set of simplifying assumptions to derive a unique, closed-form analytical solution.\n- **Objective:** The problem statement is expressed in precise, technical, and unbiased language.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained. It provides a specific definition for LET, which is crucial for the solution, and includes explicit assumptions that bound the problem, preventing ambiguity. There are no contradictions in the provided information.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a standard, albeit simplified, problem in the physics of semiconductor radiation effects. A solution will now be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Expression for Collected Charge\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the total collected charge, $Q$, at the terminals of the diode as a result of the ion passing through the depletion region. The derivation will proceed step-by-step from the given definitions and assumptions.\n\n1.  **Calculate the Total Deposited Energy ($E_{dep}$)**\nThe problem defines Linear Energy Transfer, $L$, as the energy deposited per unit path length per unit mass density. Mathematically, for a differential path length $ds$, this is:\n$$L = \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{dE}{ds}$$\nThe problem assumes that the energy deposition is uniform along the ion's path. Therefore, for a finite path length $x$, we can write this relationship without the differential, using the total deposited energy $E_{dep}$ over the length $x$:\n$$L = \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{E_{dep}}{x}$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the total energy deposited, $E_{dep}$, by the ion within the depletion region:\n$$E_{dep} = L \\cdot \\rho \\cdot x$$\n\n2.  **Calculate the Number of Electron-Hole Pairs ($N_{EHP}$)**\nThe problem states that the average energy required to create a single electron-hole pair (EHP) in silicon is $\\varepsilon$. It also assumes uniform energy-to-charge conversion. Therefore, the total number of EHPs generated, $N_{EHP}$, is the total deposited energy, $E_{dep}$, divided by the energy per pair, $\\varepsilon$:\n$$N_{EHP} = \\frac{E_{dep}}{\\varepsilon}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $E_{dep}$ from the previous step:\n$$N_{EHP} = \\frac{L \\rho x}{\\varepsilon}$$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total Collected Charge ($Q$)**\nEach electron-hole pair consists of one electron and one hole, with charge magnitudes equal to the elementary charge, $q$. When an EHP is generated in the depletion region, the strong electric field separates the electron and hole, causing them to drift towards opposite terminals. This movement of charge constitutes a current. The problem states that all generated pairs are collected with unit efficiency. This means that for every EHP generated, a total charge of $q$ is effectively collected at the terminals.\nTherefore, the total collected charge, $Q$, is the number of electron-hole pairs, $N_{EHP}$, multiplied by the elementary charge, $q$:\n$$Q = N_{EHP} \\cdot q$$\nSubstituting the expression for $N_{EHP}$:\n$$Q = \\left( \\frac{L \\rho x}{\\varepsilon} \\right) q$$\nThis can be written as a single fraction. This final expression gives the total collected charge in terms of the given parameters $L$, $x$, $\\rho$, $\\varepsilon$, and $q$.\n$$Q = \\frac{L \\rho x q}{\\varepsilon}$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression required.",

The number of upsets, $X$, in a single $k$-bit codeword over a time interval $T$ follows a Poisson distribution, $X \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\mu)$, with a mean $\\mu$ given by:\n$$\\mu = k \\cdot \\lambda_b \\cdot T$$\nAn uncorrectable error occurs if a codeword sustains two or more upsets, i.e., $X \\ge 2$. The probability of this event, $P_{\\mathrm{UE}}$, for a single codeword during one scrub interval $T$ is:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{UE}}(T) = P(X \\ge 2) = 1 - P(X=0) - P(X=1)$$\nUsing the Poisson probability mass function $P(X=j) = \\frac{\\mu^j e^{-\\mu}}{j!}$, we have:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{UE}}(T) = 1 - e^{-\\mu} - \\mu e^{-\\mu} = 1 - (1+\\mu)e^{-\\mu}$$\nGiven the very small value of $\\lambda_b$, the mean $\\mu$ will be very small for any practical scrub interval $T$. We can therefore use the Taylor series expansion for $e^{-\\mu}$ around $\\mu=0$: $e^{-\\mu} \\approx 1 - \\mu + \\frac{\\mu^2}{2!} - \\frac{\\mu^3}{3!} + \\dots$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $P_{\\mathrm{UE}}(T)$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{UE}}(T) \\approx 1 - (1+\\mu)\\left(1 - \\mu + \\frac{\\mu^2}{2}\\right) = 1 - \\left(1 - \\mu + \\frac{\\mu^2}{2} + \\mu - \\mu^2 + \\frac{\\mu^3}{2}\\right) = 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{\\mu^2}{2} + \\frac{\\mu^3}{2}\\right) \\approx \\frac{\\mu^2}{2}$$\nThis approximation is highly accurate for $\\mu \\ll 1$. Thus, the probability of an uncorrectable error in a codeword is:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{UE}}(T) \\approx \\frac{(k \\lambda_b T)^2}{2}$$\n\nThe problem specifies that the average uncorrectable event rate for the entire memory, $R_{\\mathrm{system}}$, is the expected number of uncorrectable codewords per interval divided by the interval duration $T$. The expected number of uncorrectable codewords is $N \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{UE}}(T)$.\n$$R_{\\mathrm{system}} = \\frac{N \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{UE}}(T)}{T}$$\nSubstituting our approximation for $P_{\\mathrm{UE}}(T)$:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{system}} \\approx \\frac{N}{T} \\left( \\frac{(k \\lambda_b T)^2}{2} \\right) = \\frac{N k^2 \\lambda_b^2 T}{2}$$\n\nTo find the maximum scrub interval, we set the system failure rate equal to the target failure rate, $R_{\\mathrm{system}} = R_{\\mathrm{target}}$, and solve for $T$:\n$$\\frac{N k^2 \\lambda_b^2 T}{2} = R_{\\mathrm{target}}$$\n$$T = \\frac{2 R_{\\mathrm{target}}}{N k^2 \\lambda_b^2}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values into this expression. It is computationally simpler to use the hourly rates first to find $T$ in hours, $T_{\\mathrm{hr}}$, and then convert to seconds.\n$$T_{\\mathrm{hr}} = \\frac{2 R_{\\mathrm{target,hr}}}{N k^2 \\lambda_{b,\\mathrm{hr}}^2}$$\n$$T_{\\mathrm{hr}} = \\frac{2 \\cdot (10^{-7})}{(2^{27}) \\cdot (72)^2 \\cdot (2.0 \\times 10^{-9})^2}$$\n$$T_{\\mathrm{hr}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-7}}{134217728 \\cdot 5184 \\cdot (4.0 \\times 10^{-18})}$$\n$$T_{\\mathrm{hr}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-7}}{2.783984156672 \\times 10^{-6}} \\approx 0.0718398 \\text{ hours}$$\nFinally, we convert the scrub interval $T$ to seconds:\n$$T = T_{\\mathrm{hr}} \\times 3600 \\text{ s/hr}$$\n$$T \\approx 0.0718398 \\times 3600 \\approx 258.623 \\text{ s}$$\n\nRounding the result to three significant figures as requested:\n$$T \\approx 259 \\text{ s}$$\nLet's verify the validity of the approximation $\\mu \\ll 1$ for this value of $T$.\n$$\\mu = k \\lambda_b T = 72 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-9}}{3600}\\right) \\cdot 258.623$$\n$$\\mu = (4.0 \\times 10^{-11}) \\cdot 258.623 \\approx 1.034 \\times 10^{-8}$$\nSince $\\mu \\ll 1$, the use of the approximation $P_{\\mathrm{UE}}(T) \\approx \\mu^2/2$ is fully justified.",
