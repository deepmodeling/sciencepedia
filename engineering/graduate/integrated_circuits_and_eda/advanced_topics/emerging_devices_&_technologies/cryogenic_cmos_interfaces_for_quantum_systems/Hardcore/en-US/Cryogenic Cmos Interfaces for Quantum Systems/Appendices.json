A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of an expression for the steady-state heat flow rate, $\\dot{Q}$, and its numerical calculation. The physical process is governed by Fourier's law of heat conduction. In one dimension, the law is expressed as:\n$$\n\\dot{Q} = - \\kappa(T) A \\frac{dT}{dx}\n$$\nwhere $\\dot{Q}$ is the heat flow rate (in Watts), $\\kappa(T)$ is the temperature-dependent thermal conductivity, $A$ is the cross-sectional area, and $\\frac{dT}{dx}$ is the temperature gradient along the direction of heat flow, $x$.\n\nThe problem states to assume steady-state conduction, which implies that the heat flow rate $\\dot{Q}$ is constant at every point along the wire. It also specifies that the thermal conductivity can be treated as a constant, $\\kappa(T) = \\kappa_{0}$. With these assumptions, Fourier's law simplifies to:\n$$\n\\dot{Q} = - \\kappa_0 A \\frac{dT}{dx}\n$$\nTo find the total heat flow over the length of the wire, we can rearrange this differential equation to separate the variables $x$ and $T$:\n$$\n\\dot{Q} dx = - \\kappa_0 A dT\n$$\nWe integrate both sides. The position $x$ ranges from $0$ (at the hot end) to $L$ (at the cold end). Correspondingly, the temperature $T$ ranges from $T_{\\mathrm{hot}}$ at $x=0$ to $T_{\\mathrm{cold}}$ at $x=L$.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L} \\dot{Q} dx = \\int_{T_{\\mathrm{hot}}}^{T_{\\mathrm{cold}}} - \\kappa_0 A dT\n$$\nSince $\\dot{Q}$, $\\kappa_0$, and $A$ are all constants, they can be moved outside the integrals:\n$$\n\\dot{Q} \\int_{0}^{L} dx = - \\kappa_0 A \\int_{T_{\\mathrm{hot}}}^{T_{\\mathrm{cold}}} dT\n$$\nPerforming the integration yields:\n$$\n\\dot{Q} [x]_{0}^{L} = - \\kappa_0 A [T]_{T_{\\mathrm{hot}}}^{T_{\\mathrm{cold}}}\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{Q} (L-0) = - \\kappa_0 A (T_{\\mathrm{cold}} - T_{\\mathrm{hot}})\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n\\dot{Q} L = \\kappa_0 A (T_{\\mathrm{hot}} - T_{\\mathrm{cold}})\n$$\nSolving for the heat flow rate $\\dot{Q}$ gives the derived expression:\n$$\n\\dot{Q} = \\frac{\\kappa_0 A (T_{\\mathrm{hot}} - T_{\\mathrm{cold}})}{L}\n$$\nThis expression represents the steady-state heat flow into the cold stage.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $\\dot{Q}$ using the given data. First, all values must be in consistent SI units.

The fourth digit is $8$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the third significant figure.\n$$\n\\dot{Q} \\approx 0.0237\\,\\mathrm{W}\n$$\nThis is the final computed heat flow rate into the $4\\,\\mathrm{K}$ stage.",

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Saturated Drain Current**\nThe drain current $I_D$ in an n-channel MOSFET is carried by the drift of electrons in the inversion layer. In the gradual channel approximation, the current at any point $y$ along the channel (from source at $y=0$ to drain at $y=L$) is given by the product of the channel width $W$, the magnitude of the mobile inversion charge per unit area $|Q_n(y)|$, and the electron drift velocity $v_d(y)$.\n$$I_D = W |Q_n(y)| v_d(y)$$\nThe drift velocity is related to the longitudinal electric field $E(y) = -\\frac{dV}{dy}$ by the mobility $\\mu$, such that $v_d(y) = \\mu E_y(y) = \\mu \\frac{dV}{dy}$, assuming we define the positive current direction from drain to source. To maintain conventional current direction from drain to source for an n-channel device, we use $v_d(y) = -\\mu E_y(y)$. Let's use magnitudes and integrate from source to drain. The electron velocity is $v_d = \\mu E(y) = \\mu \\frac{dV}{dy}$ where $V(y)$ is the potential in the channel with respect to the source.\nTherefore, $I_D = W |Q_n(y)| \\mu \\frac{dV}{dy}$.\n\nUnder the ideal charge-sheet model for strong inversion ($V_{GS} > V_T$), the inversion charge density at a point $y$ where the channel potential is $V(y)$ is:\n$$|Q_n(y)| = C_{\\mathrm{ox}} (V_{GS} - V_T - V(y))$$\nThis is valid as long as the local gate-to-channel voltage, $V_{GS} - V(y)$, is greater than the threshold voltage $V_T$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $|Q_n(y)|$ into the current equation gives:\n$$I_D = W \\mu C_{\\mathrm{ox}} (V_{GS} - V_T - V(y)) \\frac{dV}{dy}$$\nAssuming the current $I_D$ is constant along the channel (current continuity), we can separate variables and integrate. We integrate from the source ($y=0$, $V(0)=0$) to the drain ($y=L$, $V(L)=V_{DS}$):\n$$\\int_0^L I_D dy = \\int_0^{V_{DS}} W \\mu C_{\\mathrm{ox}} (V_{GS} - V_T - V) dV$$\n$$I_D \\int_0^L dy = W \\mu C_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\int_0^{V_{DS}} (V_{GS} - V_T - V) dV$$\n$$I_D L = W \\mu C_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\left[ (V_{GS} - V_T)V - \\frac{1}{2}V^2 \\right]_0^{V_{DS}}$$\nThis yields the general current-voltage relationship for the linear (or triode) region:\n$$I_D = \\mu C_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\frac{W}{L} \\left[ (V_{GS} - V_T)V_{DS} - \\frac{1}{2}V_{DS}^2 \\right]$$\nSaturation is defined by the channel pinch-off condition at the drain end ($y=L$). This occurs when the inversion charge density at the drain becomes zero: $|Q_n(L)|=0$.\n$$C_{\\mathrm{ox}}(V_{GS} - V_T - V_{DS}) = 0 \\implies V_{DS} = V_{GS} - V_T$$\nThis defines the saturation drain voltage, $V_{DS,\\mathrm{sat}} = V_{GS} - V_T$. For $V_{DS} \\ge V_{DS,\\mathrm{sat}}$, the MOSFET is in saturation. Since the problem neglects channel-length modulation, the current for $V_{DS} > V_{DS,\\mathrm{sat}}$ is assumed to be constant and equal to its value at $V_{DS} = V_{DS,\\mathrm{sat}}$.\n\nTo find the saturated drain current, $I_{D,\\mathrm{sat}}$, we substitute $V_{DS} = V_{DS,\\mathrm{sat}} = V_{GS} - V_T$ into the general current expression:\n$$I_{D,\\mathrm{sat}} = \\mu C_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\frac{W}{L} \\left[ (V_{GS} - V_T)(V_{GS} - V_T) - \\frac{1}{2}(V_{GS} - V_T)^2 \\right]$$\n$$I_{D,\\mathrm{sat}} = \\mu C_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\frac{W}{L} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(V_{GS} - V_T)^2 \\right]$$\nThis is the desired expression for the saturated drain current.
