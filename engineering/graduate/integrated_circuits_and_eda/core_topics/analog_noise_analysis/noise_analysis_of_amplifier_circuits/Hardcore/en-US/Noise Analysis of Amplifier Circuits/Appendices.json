Let's denote the amplifier's added noise power referred to the output as $N_{a,o}$.\n\n$$N_o = G_a N_i + N_{a,o}$$\n\nThe output signal-to-noise ratio is then:\n$$\\text{SNR}_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{S_o}{N_o} = \\frac{G_a S_i}{G_a N_i + N_{a,o}}$$\n\nSubstituting the SNR expressions back into the definition of $F$:\n$$F = \\frac{\\frac{S_i}{N_i}}{\\frac{G_a S_i}{G_a N_i + N_{a,o}}} = \\frac{S_i}{N_i} \\cdot \\frac{G_a N_i + N_{a,o}}{G_a S_i} = \\frac{G_a N_i + N_{a,o}}{G_a N_i} = 1 + \\frac{N_{a,o}}{G_a N_i}$$\n\nThe term $N_{a,o}/G_a$ represents the amplifier's added noise power referred back to the input, let's call it $N_{a,i}$.\n$$F = 1 + \\frac{N_{a,i}}{N_i}$$\n\nThe problem provides a model for noise in terms of power spectral densities (PSDs) over a bandwidth $B$. The input noise power $N_i$ comes from the source at the standard temperature $T_0$. The available one-sided noise PSD is given as $k_{\\mathrm{B}} T_0$. Integrating this over the bandwidth $B$ gives the total input noise power:\n$$N_i = k_{\\mathrm{B}} T_{0} B$$\n\nThe input-referred additional noise from the amplifier is modeled by an equivalent input noise temperature $T_e$.

The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities. The request for a numerical answer is supported by given values. The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Proceed with Solution\n\n**Derivation of Input-Referred Noise Spectral Density**\n\nWe begin by identifying the noise sources and their spectral densities.\n1.  **Collector current shot noise**: This is modeled as a current source $i_{nc}$ between the collector and emitter, with a mean-square spectral density of $\\overline{i_{nc}^2} = 2qI_C$.\n2.  **Base current shot noise**: This is modeled as a current source $i_{nb}$ between the base and emitter, with a mean-square spectral density of $\\overline{i_{nb}^2} = 2qI_B = 2q(I_C/\\beta)$.\n\nTo find the total input-referred noise, we calculate the contribution of each noise source at the amplifier's input. The standard method is to use the equivalent input noise voltage ($v_n$) and current ($i_n$) sources for the transistor. The total input-referred noise voltage spectral density for an amplifier driven by a source resistance $R_s$ is given by $\\overline{v_{in,total}^2} = \\overline{v_n^2} + (\\overline{i_n^2}) R_s^2$. The thermal noise of $R_s$ itself is ignored for optimization as per the problem statement.\n\nThe equivalent input noise voltage source $\\overline{v_n^2}$ is found by referring the collector shot noise to the input. The transconductance from the base-emitter voltage $v_{be}$ to the collector current is $g_m$. Therefore, the collector noise current $i_{nc}$ is equivalent to a voltage noise source at the base of magnitude $i_{nc}/g_m$.\n$$ \\overline{v_n^2} = \\frac{\\overline{i_{nc}^2}}{g_m^2} = \\frac{2qI_C}{g_m^2} $$\nThe equivalent input noise current source $\\overline{i_n^2}$ is simply the base shot noise current.\n$$ \\overline{i_n^2} = \\overline{i_{nb}^2} = 2qI_B = \\frac{2qI_C}{\\beta} $$\nThis model is, strictly speaking, an approximation that holds when the input resistance of the transistor, $r_\\pi$, is much larger than the source resistance $R_s$. The problem's design condition, $r_\\pi \\geq 5R_s$, explicitly directs us to operate in a regime where this approximation is justified. It simplifies the impedance seen by the base noise current to primarily $R_s$, as $r_\\pi || R_s \\approx R_s$. Thus, we can proceed with this simplified model.\n\nThe total input-referred noise voltage spectral density at the amplifier input, which we seek to minimize, is:\n$$ \\overline{v_{in}^2}(I_C) = \\overline{v_n^2} + \\overline{i_n^2} R_s^2 = \\frac{2qI_C}{g_m^2} + \\frac{2qI_C}{\\beta} R_s^2 $$\nNow, we express this entirely in terms of $I_C$ and the given constants.

The one-sided PSD, $S(f)$ for $f \\ge 0$, is related to the two-sided PSD, $S_{\\text{two-sided}}(f)$, by $S(f) = 2 S_{\\text{two-sided}}(f)$ for $f > 0$. We can rewrite the core relationship in terms of one-sided PSDs and frequency $f$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} S_{yy}(f) = |H(j2\\pi f)|^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{2} S_{xx}(f) \\right) $$\n$$ S_{yy}(f) = |H(j2\\pi f)|^2 S_{xx}(f) $$\nThis shows that the relationship holds directly for the one-sided PSDs commonly used in engineering practice.\n\nIn our specific problem, the LTI system is the amplifier, so its transfer function is $H(j2\\pi f) = A_{v}(j 2 \\pi f)$. The concept of input-referred noise models all internal noise sources as a single fictitious voltage source $e_{n,\\text{eq}}(t)$ at the input of an identical, but noiseless, amplifier.\n\nTherefore:\n-   The input signal to the noiseless amplifier is $e_{n,\\text{eq}}(t)$. Its one-sided PSD is $S_{e_{n,\\text{eq}}}(f)$.\n-   The output signal is the total output noise, which, by definition of the model, must match the measured physical output noise. Its one-sided PSD is $S_{v_{\\text{out}}}(f)$.\n\nApplying the LTI system PSD relationship, we have:\n$$ S_{v_{\\text{out}}}(f) = |A_{v}(j 2 \\pi f)|^2 S_{e_{n,\\text{eq}}}(f) $$\nOur goal is to find the input-referred voltage noise density $e_{n,\\text{eq}}(f)$, which is the one-sided root spectral density (RSD) of the fictitious input noise source. By definition, the RSD is the square root of the PSD:\n$$ e_{n,\\text{eq}}(f) = \\sqrt{S_{e_{n,\\text{eq}}}(f)} $$\nFirst, we solve the PSD equation for $S_{e_{n,\\text{eq}}}(f)$:\n$$ S_{e_{n,\\text{eq}}}(f) = \\frac{S_{v_{\\text{out}}}(f)}{|A_{v}(j 2 \\pi f)|^2} $$\nThe problem provides the output noise as a root spectral density, $v_{\\text{out},n}(f)$, which is related to its PSD by:\n$$ v_{\\text{out},n}(f) = \\sqrt{S_{v_{\\text{out}}}(f)} $$\nSquaring this gives:\n$$ S_{v_{\\text{out}}}(f) = [v_{\\text{out},n}(f)]^2 $$\nSubstituting this expression for $S_{v_{\\text{out}}}(f)$ into our equation for $S_{e_{n,\\text{eq}}}(f)$:\n$$ S_{e_{n,\\text{eq}}}(f) = \\frac{[v_{\\text{out},n}(f)]^2}{|A_{v}(j 2 \\pi f)|^2} $$\nFinally, to find the desired input-referred noise density $e_{n,\\text{eq}}(f)$, we take the square root of both sides:\n$$ e_{n,\\text{eq}}(f) = \\sqrt{\\frac{[v_{\\text{out},n}(f)]^2}{|A_{v}(j 2 \\pi f)|^2}} $$\nSince $v_{\\text{out},n}(f)$ is a root spectral density, it is a non-negative real value. Similarly, $|A_{v}(j 2 \\pi f)|$ represents the magnitude of the complex transfer function, which is also a non-negative real value. Therefore, the square root can be simplified:\n$$ e_{n,\\text{eq}}(f) = \\frac{\\sqrt{[v_{\\text{out},n}(f)]^2}}{\\sqrt{|A_{v}(j 2 \\pi f)|^2}} = \\frac{v_{\\text{out},n}(f)}{|A_{v}(j 2 \\pi f)|} $$\nThis expression represents the input-referred voltage noise density. It is obtained by taking the measured output voltage noise density and dividing it by the magnitude of the amplifier's voltage gain at each frequency $f$. This result was derived directly from the fundamental relationship governing power spectral densities in LTI systems, as required.",
