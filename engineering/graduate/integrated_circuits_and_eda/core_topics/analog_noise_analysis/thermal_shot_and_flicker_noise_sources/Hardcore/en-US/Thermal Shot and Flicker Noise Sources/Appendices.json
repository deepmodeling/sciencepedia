The physical parameters are realistic, and the classical approximation is valid for the given temperature and frequency range. The problem statement is complete and internally consistent. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nAccording to the Johnson–Nyquist theorem, the thermal noise of a resistor $R$ at absolute temperature $T$ can be modeled as a noise voltage source. The problem specifies the use of a one-sided power spectral density (PSD), which describes the noise power distribution over positive frequencies. For a resistor in the classical regime, the one-sided voltage noise PSD, denoted $S_v(f)$, is white (i.e., constant with frequency) and is given by:\n$$ S_v(f) = 4 k_B T R $$\nThe units of $S_v(f)$ are volts-squared per hertz ($\\text{V}^2/\\text{Hz}$).\n\nThis noise voltage is passed through an ideal LTI filter with a frequency response $H(f)$. The PSD of the output voltage, $S_{out}(f)$, is related to the input PSD, $S_v(f)$, by the equation:\n$$ S_{out}(f) = |H(f)|^2 S_v(f) $$\n\nThe mean-square voltage at the output, $\\langle v_{out}^2 \\rangle$, is obtained by integrating the output PSD over all frequencies. Since we are using a one-sided PSD, the integration is performed from $f=0$ to $f=\\infty$:\n$$ \\langle v_{out}^2 \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} S_{out}(f) \\, df = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |H(f)|^2 S_v(f) \\, df $$\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $S_v(f)$ and $|H(f)|$. The noise PSD is $S_v(f) = 4 k_B T R$. The filter is an ideal brick-wall filter with magnitude response $|H(f)| = 1$ for $0 \\le f \\le B$ and $|H(f)| = 0$ for $f  B$. Therefore, $|H(f)|^2$ is a rectangular function:\n$$\n|H(f)|^2 =\n\\begin{cases}\n1  \\text{for } 0 \\le f \\le B \\\\\n0  \\text{for } f  B\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nSubstituting these into the integral for the mean-square output voltage:\n$$ \\langle v_{out}^2 \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |H(f)|^2 (4 k_B T R) \\, df $$\nSince $4 k_B T R$ is a constant, we can pull it out of the integral:\n$$ \\langle v_{out}^2 \\rangle = 4 k_B T R \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |H(f)|^2 \\, df $$\nWe now use the definition of the filter response to evaluate the integral:\n$$ \\langle v_{out}^2 \\rangle = 4 k_B T R \\left( \\int_{0}^{B} 1 \\, df + \\int_{B}^{\\infty} 0 \\, df \\right) $$\nThe second integral is zero.

A key challenge in low-noise design is identifying the dominant noise source in a circuit.

            "problem": "A silicon diode is biased in direct current by an ideal voltage source through a series resistance $R_{s}$ at a uniform temperature $T$. The direct current through the diode is $I$. In the context of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) and noise-aware circuit design, consider the intrinsic random fluctuations associated with discrete carrier transport in the diode and the equilibrium thermal agitation in the series resistance. Assume the measurement is performed over a frequency band where low-frequency excess noise due to material or process nonidealities is negligible, so that the near-dc behavior can be characterized by stationary white noise contributions from carrier discreteness and thermal agitation. Starting from first principles—specifically, Poisson statistics for independent charge transport events and the fluctuation-dissipation viewpoint for equilibrium thermal agitation—derive the condition under which the diode’s current fluctuations due to carrier discreteness dominate over the current fluctuations attributable to the thermal agitation of the series resistance $R_{s}$. Determine, in closed form, the exact bias current $I_{\\star}(T,R_{s})$ at which the diode’s discreteness-induced current fluctuations just equal the series resistance’s thermal current fluctuations, so that for $II_{\\star}$ the discreteness-induced fluctuations exceed the thermal fluctuations. Express your final answer as a single analytic expression in terms of the Boltzmann constant $k_{B}$, the elementary charge $q$, the absolute temperature $T$, and the series resistance $R_{s}$.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the bias current $I_{\\star}$ at which the magnitude of current fluctuations from a forward-biased diode equals that from a series resistor $R_s$ at temperature $T$. The problem specifies that for currents $I  I_{\\star}$, the diode's fluctuations should dominate. We are instructed to start from first principles for both noise mechanisms.\n\nFirst, let us formalize the noise sources. Since the problem states to consider stationary white noise contributions, we can compare the one-sided Power Spectral Densities (PSDs) of the current fluctuations, denoted by $S_i(f)$. The mean-square current fluctuation in a frequency bandwidth $\\Delta f$ is given by $\\langle i_n^2 \\rangle = S_i(f) \\Delta f$.\n\n1.  **Diode Shot Noise Current Fluctuations**\n\nThe direct current $I$ flowing through a p-n junction is the result of a large number of discrete charge carriers (electrons and holes), each with charge $q$, crossing the junction potential barrier at random intervals. As stated in the problem, this process can be modeled using Poisson statistics for independent events. The current is not a smooth flow but a sequence of charge impulses. This inherent granularity gives rise to fluctuations around the average current $I$. This phenomenon is known as shot noise.\n\nFrom the first principle of Poisson statistics for charge transport, the one-sided power spectral density of the shot noise current, $S_{i, \\text{shot}}(f)$, is given by the Schottky formula:\n$$\nS_{i, \\text{shot}}(f) = 2qI\n$$\nThis PSD is constant over a wide range of frequencies, hence it is a white noise source. The magnitude of the shot noise current fluctuations is directly proportional to the average DC current $I$.\n\n2.  **Resistor Thermal Noise Current Fluctuations**\n\nThe thermal agitation of charge carriers within a conductor in thermal equilibrium at a temperature $T$ gives rise to random voltage fluctuations across its terminals. This is known as thermal noise or Johnson-Nyquist noise. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem provides the rigorous basis for this phenomenon. For a resistance $R_s$, the one-sided PSD of the noise voltage source, $S_{v, \\text{th}}(f)$, is given by:\n$$\nS_{v, \\text{th}}(f) = 4k_{B}TR_{s}\n$$\nwhere $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant. This noise source is modeled as an ideal voltage source in series with a noiseless resistor $R_s$.\n\nTo compare this with the diode's noise, which is inherently a current source, it is convenient to represent the resistor's thermal noise by its Norton equivalent. The Norton equivalent consists of a noise current source in parallel with the noiseless resistor $R_s$. The PSD of this equivalent noise current source, $S_{i, \\text{th}}(f)$, is found by dividing the voltage PSD by $R_{s}^2$:\n$$\nS_{i, \\text{th}}(f) = \\frac{S_{v, \\text{th}}(f)}{R_{s}^2} = \\frac{4k_{B}TR_{s}}{R_{s}^2} = \\frac{4k_{B}T}{R_{s}}\n$$\nUnlike shot noise, the magnitude of the thermal noise current fluctuations is independent of the DC current $I$ but depends on the temperature $T$ and the resistance $R_s$.\n\n3.  **Condition for Equality of Fluctuations**\n\nThe problem asks for the specific bias current $I_{\\star}$ where the diode's current fluctuations just equal the series resistance's thermal current fluctuations. This implies a direct comparison of the fundamental noise source strengths, as represented by their respective current PSDs. The problem states that for $I  I_{\\star}$, the shot noise should dominate, which confirms this interpretation, as $S_{i, \\text{shot}}(f)$ is proportional to $I$ while $S_{i, \\text{th}}(f)$ is constant with respect to $I$.\n\nWe set the two PSDs equal to find the crossover current $I_{\\star}$:\n$$\nS_{i, \\text{shot}}(f) \\Big|_{I=I_{\\star}} = S_{i, \\text{th}}(f)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the PSDs:\n$$\n2qI_{\\star} = \\frac{4k_{B}T}{R_{s}}\n$$\n\n4.  **Derivation of the Bias Current $I_{\\star}$**\n\nSolving the equation for $I_{\\star}$ yields:\n$$\nI_{\\star} = \\frac{4k_{B}T}{2qR_{s}}\n$$\n$$\nI_{\\star} = \\frac{2k_{B}T}{qR_{s}}\n$$\nThis expression gives the exact bias current at which the magnitude of the shot noise current source equals the magnitude of the Norton equivalent thermal noise current source of the resistor. For any current $I  I_{\\star}$, the inequality $2qI  \\frac{4k_{B}T}{R_{s}}$ holds, meaning the shot noise fluctuations from the diode will indeed exceed the thermal noise fluctuations attributable to the resistor, consistent with the problem statement. The expression is in terms of the fundamental constants $k_B$, $q$, the temperature $T$, and the resistance $R_s$, as required.",

Over a bandwidth $B$, this is $N_{\\mathrm{in}} = k_B T_0 B$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\nThe total noise power at the output of a network with power gain $G$ and noise factor $F$ is the sum of the amplified input noise and the noise added by the network itself. This can be expressed as:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{out}} = G F N_{\\mathrm{in}} = G F k_B T_0 B$$\nThe noise added by the network, referred to its own input, is $N_{\\mathrm{added,in}} = (F-1)k_B T_0 B$.\n\nThe system is a cascade of two networks:\nStage 1: Passive attenuator with linear power loss $L$, which means its power gain is $G_1 = 1/L$. It is at a physical temperature $T$.\nStage 2: LNA with power gain $G_2$ and noise factor $F_2$.\n\nWe will derive the total noise factor $F_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ by calculating the total noise power at the output of the cascade, $N_{\\mathrm{out,tot}}$, and normalizing it. The total gain of the cascade is $G_{\\mathrm{tot}} = G_1 G_2$.\n\nThe total output noise power $N_{\\mathrm{out,tot}}$ is the sum of three components:\n1.  The source noise, amplified by both stages.\n2.  The noise added by Stage 1, amplified by Stage 2.\n3.  The noise added by Stage 2.\n\nLet's analyze each stage.\nFor Stage 1 (the attenuator), the input is the source noise $N_{\\mathrm{in}} = k_B T_0 B$. As a passive element at physical temperature $T$, its own generated noise power, referred to its output, is given by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. A passive two-port with gain $G_1$ at temperature $T$ adds noise power $N_{\\mathrm{added,1,out}} = (1-G_1)k_B T B$. Since $G_1 = 1/L$, this becomes:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{added,1,out}} = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{L}\\right) k_B T B$$\nThe total noise power at the output of Stage 1, $N_{\\mathrm{out,1}}$, is the sum of the attenuated source noise and the self-generated noise:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{out,1}} = G_1 N_{\\mathrm{in}} + N_{\\mathrm{added,1,out}} = \\frac{1}{L} k_B T_0 B + \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{L}\\right) k_B T B$$\n\nThis noise power $N_{\\mathrm{out,1}}$ becomes the input noise to Stage 2. The noise added by Stage 2, referred to its own output, is:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{added,2,out}} = (F_2-1) G_2 k_B T_0 B$$\n\nThe total noise power at the output of the cascade is the sum of the noise from Stage 1 amplified by Stage 2, and the noise added by Stage 2:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{out,tot}} = G_2 N_{\\mathrm{out,1}} + N_{\\mathrm{added,2,out}}$$\n$$N_{\\mathrm{out,tot}} = G_2 \\left[ \\frac{1}{L} k_B T_0 B + \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{L}\\right) k_B T B \\right] + (F_2-1) G_2 k_B T_0 B$$\n\nThe total noise factor $F_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ is defined relative to the total gain $G_{\\mathrm{tot}} = G_1 G_2 = (1/L) G_2$ and the standard input noise $N_{\\mathrm{in}} = k_B T_0 B$:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{out,tot}}}{G_{\\mathrm{tot}} N_{\\mathrm{in}}} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{out,tot}}}{\\frac{1}{L} G_2 k_B T_0 B}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $N_{\\mathrm{out,tot}}$:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\frac{G_2 k_B B \\left[ \\frac{1}{L} T_0 + (1 - \\frac{1}{L}) T + (F_2-1) T_0 \\right]}{\\frac{1}{L} G_2 k_B T_0 B}$$\nThe terms $G_2$, $k_B$, and $B$ cancel.\n$$F_{\\mathrm{tot}} = L \\left[ \\frac{1}{L} \\frac{T_0}{T_0} + \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{L}\\right) \\frac{T}{T_0} + (F_2-1) \\frac{T_0}{T_0} \\right]$$\n$$F_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 1 + (L - 1)\\frac{T}{T_0} + L(F_2-1)$$\nThis is the required analytic expression for the total cascade noise factor, showing its dependence on $L$, $T/T_0$, and $F_2$. Note that it is also equivalent to Friis's formula for cascades, $F_{\\mathrm{tot}} = F_1 + (F_2-1)/G_1$, where the noise factor of the attenuator is $F_1 = 1 + (L-1)T/T_0$ and its gain is $G_1 = 1/L$.\n\nNow, we compute the total noise figure $NF_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ for the specific case given: $T=T_0$, attenuator loss is $1\\,\\text{dB}$, and $NF_2 = 0.65\\,\\text{dB}$.\nFirst, we substitute $T=T_0$ into the general expression for $F_{\\mathrm{tot}}$:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 1 + (L - 1)\\frac{T_0}{T_0} + L(F_2-1) = 1 + L - 1 + L(F_2-1) = L + LF_2 - L = L F_2$$\nThis simplified formula, $F_{\\mathrm{tot}} = L F_2$, is specific to the case where the passive first stage is at the reference temperature $T_0$.\n\nThe total noise figure $NF_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ is the decibel representation of the total noise factor $F_{\\mathrm{tot}}$:\n$$NF_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 10 \\log_{10}(F_{\\mathrm{tot}})$$\nSubstituting $F_{\\mathrm{tot}} = L F_2$:\n$$NF_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 10 \\log_{10}(L F_2) = 10 \\log_{10}(L) + 10 \\log_{10}(F_2)$$\nBy definition, the loss of the attenuator in decibels is $L_{\\mathrm{dB}} = 10 \\log_{10}(L)$, and the noise figure of the LNA is $NF_2 = 10 \\log_{10}(F_2)$. Thus, for this specific case, the total noise figure is the sum of the component decibel values:\n$$NF_{\\mathrm{tot}} = L_{\\mathrm{dB}} + NF_2$$\nWe are given the values:\n$L_{\\mathrm{dB}} = 1\\,\\text{dB}$\n$NF_2 = 0.65\\,\\text{dB}$\n\nSubstituting these values:\n$$NF_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 1\\,\\text{dB} + 0.65\\,\\text{dB} = 1.65\\,\\text{dB}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\nThe calculated value is $1.65$.
