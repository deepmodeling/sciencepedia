It presents a standard, non-trivial problem in digital circuit analysis that can be solved rigorously from first principles as requested. The problem is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the time-domain expression for the dynamic node voltage, $v_{dyn}(t)$, during the evaluate phase of a domino logic gate, and subsequently, the calculation of a specific evaluation time, $t_{eval}$.\n\nDuring the evaluate phase, the precharged dynamic node, with capacitance $C_{dyn}$, discharges to ground through the pull-down network, which is modeled as a resistor $R_{pd}$. The circuit can be represented as a capacitor $C_{dyn}$ in parallel with a resistor $R_{pd}$, both connected between the dynamic node and ground. The voltage at this node is $v_{dyn}(t)$.\n\nAccording to Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL), the sum of currents leaving the dynamic node must be zero. The current flowing out of the capacitor is $i_C$, and the current flowing through the resistor is $i_R$. Both currents flow from the dynamic node toward ground.\n$$\ni_C(t) + i_R(t) = 0\n$$\nThe problem specifies the constitutive relations to be used. The capacitor current is given by $i_C = C_{dyn} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{dyn}}{\\mathrm{d}t}$. The resistor current is given by Ohm's law, $i_R = \\frac{v_{dyn}(t)}{R_{pd}}$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the KCL equation yields the governing differential equation for the circuit:\n$$\nC_{dyn} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{dyn}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{v_{dyn}(t)}{R_{pd}} = 0\n$$\nThis is a first-order homogeneous linear ordinary differential equation. To solve it, we can use the method of separation of variables.\n$$\nC_{dyn} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{dyn}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\frac{v_{dyn}}{R_{pd}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{dyn}}{v_{dyn}} = -\\frac{1}{R_{pd}C_{dyn}} \\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nWe integrate both sides of the equation:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{1}{v_{dyn}} \\mathrm{d}v_{dyn} = \\int -\\frac{1}{R_{pd}C_{dyn}} \\mathrm{d}t\n$$\n$$\n\\ln|v_{dyn}| = -\\frac{t}{R_{pd}C_{dyn}} + K\n$$\nwhere $K$ is the constant of integration. Since the voltage $v_{dyn}$ starts at $V_{DD}$ and decays towards $0$, it remains non-negative, so the absolute value can be dropped.\n\nExponentiating both sides gives:\n$$\nv_{dyn}(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{R_{pd}C_{dyn}} + K\\right) = \\exp(K) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{R_{pd}C_{dyn}}\\right)\n$$\nLet's define a constant $A = \\exp(K)$. The general solution is:\n$$\nv_{dyn}(t) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{R_{pd}C_{dyn}}\\right)\n$$\nTo find the value of $A$, we apply the initial condition. During the precharge phase, the dynamic node is charged to $V_{DD}$. The evaluate phase begins at $t=0$. Therefore, the initial condition is $v_{dyn}(0) = V_{DD}$.\n$$\nv_{dyn}(0) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0}{R_{pd}C_{dyn}}\\right) = A \\exp(0) = A\n$$\nThus, $A = V_{DD}$. The specific solution for the dynamic node voltage during the evaluate phase is:\n$$\nv_{dyn}(t) = V_{DD} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{R_{pd}C_{dyn}}\\right)\n$$\nThe term $R_{pd}C_{dyn}$ is the time constant of the circuit, denoted by $\\tau$. So, $v_{dyn}(t) = V_{DD} \\exp(-t/\\tau)$.\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum evaluate time $t_{eval}$ required to ensure that the node voltage drops strictly below $0.2\\,V_{DD}$. This minimum time corresponds to the boundary condition where the voltage reaches exactly $0.2\\,V_{DD}$.\n$$\nv_{dyn}(t_{eval}) = 0.2\\,V_{DD}\n$$\nSubstituting this into our derived voltage expression:\n$$\nV_{DD} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{eval}}{R_{pd}C_{dyn}}\\right) = 0.2\\,V_{DD}\n$$\nDividing both sides by $V_{DD}$ (assuming $V_{DD} \\neq 0$):\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{eval}}{R_{pd}C_{dyn}}\\right) = 0.2\n$$\nTo solve for $t_{eval}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n-\\frac{t_{eval}}{R_{pd}C_{dyn}} = \\ln(0.2)\n$$\nSolving for $t_{eval}$:\n$$\nt_{eval} = -R_{pd}C_{dyn} \\ln(0.2)\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms $\\ln(1/x) = -\\ln(x)$, we have $\\ln(0.2) = \\ln(1/5) = -\\ln(5)$.\n$$\nt_{eval} = R_{pd}C_{dyn} \\ln(5)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $R_{pd} = 5\\,\\mathrm{k}\\Omega = 5 \\times 10^3\\,\\Omega$ and $C_{dyn} = 40\\,\\mathrm{fF} = 40 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{F}$.\nFirst, calculate the time constant $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\tau = R_{pd}C_{dyn} = (5 \\times 10^3\\,\\Omega) \\times (40 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{F}) = 200 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 200\\,\\mathrm{ps}\n$$\nNow, calculate $t_{eval}$:\n$$\nt_{eval} = (200 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\times \\ln(5)\n$$\nThe value of $\\ln(5)$ is approximately $1.60943791$.\n$$\nt_{eval} \\approx (200 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\times 1.60943791 \\approx 321.887582 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThis is approximately $321.887582\\,\\mathrm{ps}$. The problem requires the answer in nanoseconds ($1\\,\\mathrm{ns} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{ps}$).\n$$\nt_{eval} \\approx 0.321887582\\,\\mathrm{ns}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\nt_{eval} \\approx 0.3219\\,\\mathrm{ns}\n$$\nThis is the minimum time for the evaluate phase to guarantee the dynamic node voltage falls below the specified threshold.",

The charge stored on this capacitor is $Q_{\\mathrm{dyn, initial}} = C_{\\mathrm{dyn}} V_{DD}$.\n    - The internal nodes, with total capacitance $\\sum C_s$, are at ground potential, $0\\,\\text{V}$. The charge stored on these capacitances is $Q_{s, \\mathrm{initial}} = (\\sum C_s) \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n    - The total initial charge $Q_{\\mathrm{total, initial}}$ in the system to be connected is the sum of these charges:\n    $$Q_{\\mathrm{total, initial}} = Q_{\\mathrm{dyn, initial}} + Q_{s, \\mathrm{initial}} = C_{\\mathrm{dyn}} V_{DD}$$\n\n2.  **Final State (Post-Charge-Sharing):**\n    - During evaluation, the evaluation network connects the dynamic node to the internal nodes. These capacitances are now connected in parallel, forming a single electrical node.\n    - The total capacitance of this combined node is $C_{\\mathrm{total}} = C_{\\mathrm{dyn}} + \\sum C_s$.\n    - After charge redistribution, this entire node settles to a final, common voltage, which we denote as $V_f$.\n    - The total charge stored in the system at this final state is:\n    $$Q_{\\mathrm{total, final}} = C_{\\mathrm{total}} V_f = (C_{\\mathrm{dyn}} + \\sum C_s) V_f$$\n\n3.  **Application of Charge Conservation:**\n    - Since the network is electrically floating (no path to $V_{DD}$ or ground), the total charge must be conserved: $Q_{\\mathrm{total, initial}} = Q_{\\mathrm{total, final}}$.\n    $$C_{\\mathrm{dyn}} V_{DD} = (C_{\\mathrm{dyn}} + \\sum C_s) V_f$$\n    - We can solve for the final voltage $V_f$ as a function of the capacitances and initial voltage:\n    $$V_f = V_{DD} \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{dyn}}}{C_{\\mathrm{dyn}} + \\sum C_s}$$\n\n4.  **Imposing the Design Constraint:**\n    - For the subsequent inverter to correctly interpret the dynamic node's state as a logic 'high', its voltage must remain above the inverter's switching threshold, $V_M$.\n    - Therefore, the constraint is $V_f \\ge V_M$.\n    - To find the minimum required capacitance $C_{\\mathrm{dyn}}$, we consider the boundary condition where the final voltage is exactly at the switching threshold: $V_f = V_M$.

We can separate variables and integrate to find the evaluation time $t_{\\mathrm{eval}}$.\n$$\\mathrm{d}t = -\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{L}}}{I_{\\mathrm{on}}(W)} \\mathrm{d}V$$\n$$\\int_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{eval}}} \\mathrm{d}t = -\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{L}}}{\\beta W} \\int_{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}^{V_{\\mathrm{M}}} \\mathrm{d}V$$\n$$t_{\\mathrm{eval}}(W) = -\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{L}}}{\\beta W} [V]_{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}^{V_{\\mathrm{M}}} = -\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{L}}}{\\beta W} (V_{\\mathrm{M}} - V_{\\mathrm{DD}})$$\n$$t_{\\mathrm{eval}}(W) = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{L}}(V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{M}})}{\\beta W}$$\nAs expected, the evaluation time is inversely proportional to the transistor width $W$.\n\n### Derivation of Hold-Time Voltage Drop $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{hold}}(W)$\nDuring the hold phase (precharge phase for the next stage), the footer transistor is off, but a subthreshold leakage current $I_{\\mathrm{sub}}(W)$ still flows, discharging the capacitor $C_{\\mathrm{L}}$. This current is given by $I_{\\mathrm{sub}}(W) = I_{\\mathrm{sub,unit}} W$. The change in voltage $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{hold}}$ over a time interval $t_{\\mathrm{hold}}$ is related to the total charge lost $\\Delta Q$.\n$$\\Delta Q = I_{\\mathrm{sub}}(W) \\times t_{\\mathrm{hold}}$$\nFrom the definition of capacitance, $Q = CV$, so $\\Delta Q = C_{\\mathrm{L}} \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{hold}}$.\nEquating the two expressions for $\\Delta Q$:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{L}} \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{hold}}(W) = I_{\\mathrm{sub}}(W) t_{\\mathrm{hold}}$$\n$$\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{hold}}(W) = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{sub}}(W) t_{\\mathrm{hold}}}{C_{\\mathrm{L}}} = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{sub,unit}} W t_{\\mathrm{hold}}}{C_{\\mathrm{L}}}$$\nThe voltage drop due to leakage is directly proportional to the transistor width $W$.\n\n### Formulation and Solution of the Optimization Problem\nThe problem is to minimize the objective function $f(W)$ subject to two constraints:\n$$\\text{Minimize } f(W) = \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{eval}}(W)}{T_{\\mathrm{eval},\\max}} + \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{hold}}(W)}{\\Delta V_{\\max}}$$\nSubject to:\n1. $t_{\\mathrm{eval}}(W) \\leq T_{\\mathrm{eval},\\max}$\n2. $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{hold}}(W) \\leq \\Delta V_{\\max}$\n\nSubstituting the derived expressions for $t_{\\mathrm{eval}}(W)$ and $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{hold}}(W)$:\n$$f(W) = \\left(\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{L}}(V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{M}})}{\\beta T_{\\mathrm{eval},\\max}}\\right) \\frac{1}{W} + \\left(\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{sub,unit}} t_{\\mathrm{hold}}}{C_{\\mathrm{L}} \\Delta V_{\\max}}\\right) W$$\nThis is of the form $f(W) = \\frac{K_1}{W} + K_2 W$, where:\n$$K_1 = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{L}}(V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{M}})}{\\beta T_{\\mathrm{eval},\\max}}$$\n$$K_2 = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{sub,unit}} t_{\\mathrm{hold}}}{C_{\\mathrm{L}} \\Delta V_{\\max}}$$\nTo find the minimum, we compute the derivative of $f(W)$ with respect to $W$ and set it to zero:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}f(W)}{\\mathrm{d}W} = -\\frac{K_1}{W^2} + K_2 = 0$$\n$$K_2 = \\frac{K_1}{W^2} \\implies W^2 = \\frac{K_1}{K_2}$$\nThis gives the unconstrained optimal width $W_{\\mathrm{opt,unc}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{K_1}{K_2}}$. The second derivative, $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2f}{\\mathrm{d}W^2} = \\frac{2K_1}{W^3}$, is positive for $W>0$, confirming this is a minimum.\n\nNext, we evaluate the constraints to find the feasible range for $W$.\nFrom constraint 1: $\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{L}}(V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{M}})}{\\beta W} \\leq T_{\\mathrm{eval},\\max} \\implies W \\geq \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{L}}(V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{M}})}{\\beta T_{\\mathrm{eval},\\max}} = K_1$. Let this be $W_{\\min} = K_1$.\nFrom constraint 2: $\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{sub,unit}} W t_{\\mathrm{hold}}}{C_{\\mathrm{L}}} \\leq \\Delta V_{\\max} \\implies W \\leq \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{L}} \\Delta V_{\\max}}{I_{\\mathrm{sub,unit}} t_{\\mathrm{hold}}} = \\frac{1}{K_2}$. Let this be $W_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{K_2}$.\nThe feasible region for $W$ is $[W_{\\min}, W_{\\max}]$. The optimal solution $W_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ is the unconstrained optimum if it lies within this region. If $W_{\\mathrm{opt,unc}} < W_{\\min}$, the optimum is at $W_{\\min}$. If $W_{\\mathrm{opt,unc}} > W_{\\max}$, the optimum is at $W_{\\max}$.\n\nLet's substitute the numerical values. We will use a consistent set of units: Volts ($\\mathrm{V}$), micrometers ($\\mu\\mathrm{m}$), femtofarads ($\\mathrm{fF}$), picoseconds ($\\mathrm{ps}$), and milliamps ($\\mathrm{mA}$).\n- $V_{\\mathrm{DD}} = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n- $V_{\\mathrm{M}} = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n- $C_{\\mathrm{L}} = 2\\,\\mathrm{fF}$\n- $T_{\\mathrm{eval},\\max} = 40\\,\\mathrm{ps}$\n- $t_{\\mathrm{hold}} = 2\\,\\mathrm{ns} = 2000\\,\\mathrm{ps}$\n- $\\Delta V_{\\max} = 50\\,\\mathrm{mV} = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n- $\\beta = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mA}/\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n- $I_{\\mathrm{sub,unit}} = 100\\,\\mathrm{nA}/\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 0.0001\\,\\mathrm{mA}/\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n\nCalculate $W_{\\min}$ and $W_{\\max}$:\n$$W_{\\min} = K_1 = \\frac{(2\\,\\mathrm{fF})(0.8\\,\\mathrm{V} - 0.4\\,\\mathrm{V})}{(0.5\\,\\mathrm{mA}/\\mu\\mathrm{m})(40\\,\\mathrm{ps})} = \\frac{2 \\times 0.4}{0.5 \\times 40}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = \\frac{0.8}{20}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 0.04\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\n$$W_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{K_2} = \\frac{(2\\,\\mathrm{fF})(0.05\\,\\mathrm{V})}{(0.0001\\,\\mathrm{mA}/\\mu\\mathrm{m})(2000\\,\\mathrm{ps})} = \\frac{2 \\times 0.05}{0.0001 \\times 2000}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = \\frac{0.1}{0.2}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\nThe feasible range is $W \\in [0.04\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}, 0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}]$.\n\nNow, calculate the unconstrained optimum $W_{\\mathrm{opt,unc}}$. We need $K_2$:\n$$K_2 = \\frac{1}{W_{\\max}} = \\frac{1}{0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}} = 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$$\n$$W_{\\mathrm{opt,unc}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{K_1}{K_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.04\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1}}} = \\sqrt{0.02\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2} = \\sqrt{0.02}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\nNumerically, $\\sqrt{0.02} \\approx 0.141421356...$.\nSo, $W_{\\mathrm{opt,unc}} \\approx 0.1414\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nWe check if this value is within the feasible range:\n$$0.04\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} \\leq 0.1414\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} \\leq 0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\nThe condition is satisfied. Therefore, the optimal width $W_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ that minimizes the objective function while satisfying the constraints is this unconstrained minimum.\n$$W_{\\mathrm{opt}} = \\sqrt{0.02}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer rounded to four significant figures.\n$$W_{\\mathrm{opt}} \\approx 0.1414\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$",
            "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1414}$$"
