The NMOS gate is driven to $V_{DD}$ when a logic-high is to be passed forward, and its body is tied to ground. Due to source-body bias, the high level at node $X$ is degraded relative to $V_{DD}$. The node $X$ interfaces to a level-restoring receiver composed of a static complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) inverter followed by a feedback-controlled $p$-channel metal-oxide semiconductor (PMOS) pull-up that, once the inverter switches, restores $X$ to $V_{DD}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the minimum supply voltage, $V_{DD, \\min}$, for a pass-transistor circuit to function correctly with a level-restoring receiver. The analysis begins by formalizing the conditions provided.\n\nFirst, we consider the behavior of the $n$-channel metal-oxide semiconductor (NMOS) pass transistor. It is configured to pass a high logic level. The gate is connected to the supply voltage, $V_{DD}$. The drain is connected to the high-level source, also at $V_{DD}$. The source of the transistor is connected to the node of interest, $X$, so its voltage is $V_X$. The body of the transistor is grounded, so its potential is $0$.\n\nThe transistor will pass current from drain to source as long as its gate-to-source voltage, $V_{GS}$, is greater than its threshold voltage, $V_{TN}$. The gate voltage is $V_G = V_{DD}$ and the source voltage is $V_S = V_X$. Thus, $V_{GS} = V_G - V_S = V_{DD} - V_X$. As charge flows onto node $X$, its voltage $V_X$ rises, causing $V_{GS}$ to decrease. Conduction ceases and node $X$ reaches its stable, final voltage when $V_{GS}$ drops to the threshold voltage, $V_{TN}$. This equilibrium state is described by the given relation:\n$$V_{X} = V_{DD} - V_{TN}(V_X)$$\nThe notation $V_{TN}(V_X)$ emphasizes that the threshold voltage itself depends on the source voltage $V_X$ due to the body effect.\n\nThe body effect describes the change in threshold voltage due to a non-zero source-to-body bias, $V_{SB}$. Here, the source is at potential $V_S = V_X$ and the body is at $V_B = 0$, so $V_{SB} = V_S - V_B = V_X - 0 = V_X$. The problem provides the standard model for the threshold voltage under this bias:\n$$V_{TN}(V_{SB}) = V_{TN0} + \\gamma \\left( \\sqrt{2\\phi_{F} + V_{SB}} - \\sqrt{2\\phi_{F}} \\right)$$\nwhere $V_{TN0}$ is the zero-bias threshold voltage, $\\gamma$ is the body-effect coefficient, and $2\\phi_F$ is the surface potential at strong inversion, with $\\phi_F$ being the Fermi potential of the substrate.\n\nSubstituting $V_{SB} = V_X$ into the threshold voltage equation, we get:\n$$V_{TN}(V_X) = V_{TN0} + \\gamma \\left( \\sqrt{2\\phi_{F} + V_X} - \\sqrt{2\\phi_{F}} \\right)$$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $V_{TN}(V_X)$ back into the equilibrium condition for the node voltage $V_X$:\n$$V_{X} = V_{DD} - \\left[ V_{TN0} + \\gamma \\left( \\sqrt{2\\phi_{F} + V_X} - \\sqrt{2\\phi_{F}} \\right) \\right]$$\nThis equation relates the steady-state passed voltage $V_X$ to the supply voltage $V_{DD}$ and the device parameters.\n\nThe problem states that for the level-restoring receiver to trigger, the voltage at node $X$ must be at least the inverter's switching threshold, $V_M$. This condition is expressed as:\n$$V_{X} \\geq V_{M}$$\n\nWe are seeking the minimum supply voltage, $V_{DD, \\min}$, that satisfies this condition. The minimum voltage corresponds to the limiting case where the passed voltage $V_X$ is exactly equal to the required minimum value, $V_M$. By setting $V_X = V_M$ and correspondingly $V_{DD} = V_{DD, \\min}$, we can solve for the required supply voltage.\n\nSubstituting $V_X = V_M$ into the governing equation:\n$$V_{M} = V_{DD, \\min} - \\left[ V_{TN0} + \\gamma \\left( \\sqrt{2\\phi_{F} + V_M} - \\sqrt{2\\phi_{F}} \\right) \\right]$$\n\nTo find the expression for $V_{DD, \\min}$, we rearrange the equation by isolating $V_{DD, \\min}$ on one side:\n$$V_{DD, \\min} = V_M + V_{TN0} + \\gamma \\left( \\sqrt{2\\phi_{F} + V_M} - \\sqrt{2\\phi_{F}} \\right)$$\n\nThis is the final, closed-form analytic expression for the minimum required supply voltage. It is expressed solely in terms of the given parameters: the inverter switching threshold $V_M$, the zero-bias NMOS threshold $V_{TN0}$, the body-effect coefficient $\\gamma$, and the Fermi potential $\\phi_F$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the final voltage on node $B$, $V_{B,final}$, after a system of two capacitors connected by a pass transistor reaches equilibrium.\n\nFirst, we identify the given parameters:\n- Capacitance of node A: $C_{A} = 20\\,\\mathrm{fF}$\n- Initial voltage of node A: $V_{A}(0^{-}) = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n- Capacitance of node B: $C_{B} = 40\\,\\mathrm{fF}$\n- Initial voltage of node B: $V_{B}(0^{-}) = 0\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n- MOSFET gate voltage for $t \\ge 0$: $V_G = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n- MOSFET body (bulk) voltage: $V_{bulk} = 0\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n- MOSFET threshold voltage parameters: $V_{t\\!n0} = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{V}$, $\\gamma = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{V}^{1/2}$, $2\\phi_{F} = 0.7\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n\nThe core principles to be used are charge conservation and MOSFET operation theory. The combined system of node A and node B is isolated, as stated by the assumptions of negligible leakage and no other charge sources or sinks. Therefore, the total charge in the system must be conserved.\n\nThe initial total charge $Q_{total}$ on the isolated network is the sum of the charges on each capacitor:\n$$\nQ_{total} = Q_{A}(0^{-}) + Q_{B}(0^{-}) = C_{A}V_{A}(0^{-}) + C_{B}V_{B}(0^{-})\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nQ_{total} = (20 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{F})(1.0\\,\\mathrm{V}) + (40 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{F})(0\\,\\mathrm{V}) = 20 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{C} = 20\\,\\mathrm{fC}\n$$\n\nWhen the n-channel MOSFET is turned on at $t=0$, it connects nodes A and B. Since $V_A  V_B$ initially, a current will flow from node A to node B, causing $V_A$ to decrease and $V_B$ to increase. For an n-channel MOSFET, the source terminal is the one at the lower potential. Thus, node B is the source ($V_S = V_B$) and node A is the drain ($V_D = V_A$).\n\nThe system will reach a final steady state when charge transfer ceases. This can happen for one of two reasons:\n1. The potential difference between the nodes becomes zero, i.e., $V_A = V_B$. If this occurs, charge redistribution is complete.\n2. The pass transistor turns off, halting the flow of current before the voltages can equalize.\n\nLet's analyze both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: The voltages equalize.\nIf the final state is characterized by $V_{A,final} = V_{B,final} = V_f$, then the total charge is distributed across the total capacitance $C_A + C_B$:\n$$\nQ_{total} = (C_A + C_B) V_f\n$$\nUsing the principle of charge conservation, we can find this equilibrium voltage $V_f$:\n$$\nV_f = \\frac{Q_{total}}{C_A + C_B} = \\frac{C_A V_A(0^{-})}{C_A + C_B}\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\nV_f = \\frac{(20\\,\\mathrm{fF})(1.0\\,\\mathrm{V})}{20\\,\\mathrm{fF} + 40\\,\\mathrm{fF}} = \\frac{20}{60}\\,\\mathrm{V} = \\frac{1}{3}\\,\\mathrm{V} \\approx 0.3333\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\nThis scenario is only possible if the transistor remains conducting until the voltages have equalized. The condition for the transistor to be conducting is $V_{GS}  V_{t\\!n}(V_{SB})$. At the point of equalization, the source voltage is $V_S = V_B = V_f$. The gate-to-source voltage is:\n$$\nV_{GS} = V_G - V_S = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_f = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{V} - \\frac{1}{3}\\,\\mathrm{V} = \\frac{2}{3}\\,\\mathrm{V} \\approx 0.6667\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\nThe source-to-body voltage is $V_{SB} = V_S - V_{bulk} = V_f - 0\\,\\mathrm{V} = \\frac{1}{3}\\,\\mathrm{V}$. The threshold voltage at this bias is:\n$$\nV_{t\\!n}(V_{SB}) = V_{t\\!n0} + \\gamma \\left(\\sqrt{2\\phi_{F} + V_{SB}} - \\sqrt{2\\phi_{F}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nV_{t\\!n}(1/3\\,\\mathrm{V}) = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{V} + (0.4\\,\\mathrm{V}^{1/2}) \\left(\\sqrt{0.7\\,\\mathrm{V} + \\frac{1}{3}\\,\\mathrm{V}} - \\sqrt{0.7\\,\\mathrm{V}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nV_{t\\!n}(1/3\\,\\mathrm{V}) = 0.25 + 0.4 \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2.1+1}{3}} - \\sqrt{0.7}\\right) = 0.25 + 0.4 \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{3.1}{3}} - \\sqrt{0.7}\\right)\n$$\nNumerically evaluating this:\n$$\nV_{t\\!n}(1/3\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\approx 0.25 + 0.4 \\left(\\sqrt{1.0333} - \\sqrt{0.7}\\right) \\approx 0.25 + 0.4 (1.01653 - 0.83666)\n$$\n$$\nV_{t\\!n}(1/3\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\approx 0.25 + 0.4 (0.17987) \\approx 0.25 + 0.07195 = 0.32195\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\nAt the equalization voltage $V_f$, we have $V_{GS} \\approx 0.6667\\,\\mathrm{V}$ and $V_{t\\!n} \\approx 0.3220\\,\\mathrm{V}$. Since $V_{GS}  V_{t\\!n}$, the transistor is indeed still conducting. This confirms that the system will reach the fully charge-shared state where $V_{A,final} = V_{B,final} = V_f$.\n\nCase 2: The transistor cuts off before equalization.\nThis would happen if the maximum voltage that node B can reach, let's call it $V_{B,max}$, is less than the charge-sharing voltage $V_f$. The transistor cuts off when $V_{GS} \\leq V_{t\\!n}(V_{SB})$. The limit of conduction occurs at $V_{GS} = V_{t\\!n}(V_{SB})$. This determines $V_{B,max}$:\n$$\nV_G - V_{B,max} = V_{t\\!n}(V_{B,max})\n$$\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{B,max} = V_{t\\!n0} + \\gamma \\left(\\sqrt{2\\phi_{F} + V_{B,max}} - \\sqrt{2\\phi_{F}}\\right)\n$$\nWe have already established that at $V_B = V_f = 1/3\\,\\mathrm{V}$, the condition $V_{DD} - V_B  V_{t\\!n}(V_B)$ holds. This means that $V_{B,max}$ is higher than $V_f$. Therefore, the transistor does not cut off before the voltages equalize.\n\nThe final state of the network is thus determined by charge conservation, resulting in the equalization of voltages on both nodes. The final voltage on node B is:\n$$\nV_{B,final} = V_f = \\frac{1}{3}\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nV_{B,final} = \\frac{1}{3}\\,\\mathrm{V} \\approx 0.333333...\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.3333\\,\\mathrm{V}$.",

This transformation does not alter the Boolean function realized along the path but changes the resistive-capacitive profile that governs dynamic delay. Assume the following physically consistent conditions:\n\n- When enabled, each NMOS pass device is modeled as a linear resistor of value $R_{n}$ and passes a static logic-high level limited to $V_{DD} - V_{Tn}$, where $V_{DD}$ is the supply and $V_{Tn}$ is the NMOS threshold voltage.\n- When enabled, the TG is modeled as a linear resistor of value $R_{tg}$ and passes both logic-low and logic-high without static level loss.\n- The three enabled edges are in series from the source node to the output node, passing a rising step from the source to the output at time $t=0$.

An enabled NMOS pass device that attempts to pass a logic-high charges its downstream node until the gate-to-source voltage equals the NMOS threshold, so the asymptotic high level at that node is $V_{DD} - V_{Tn}$. An enabled complementary transmission gate (TG), formed by parallel NMOS and p-channel metal-oxide-semiconductor (PMOS) devices with complementary gate drives, passes both logic levels without static loss. For dynamics, we use the linear resistive-capacitive (RC) model: each enabled switch is a resistor and each node has a shunt capacitance. The source is ideal ($0\\,\\Omega$) and drives a rising step at $t=0$.\n\nFirst, we check the steady-state high-level constraint. If any enabled NMOS pass transistor lies on the path between the source at $V_{DD}$ and the output node, the highest achievable static level at and beyond the source-side of the last such NMOS is $V_{DD} - V_{Tn}$. With exactly one TG and two NMOS in series on the path, there is at least one NMOS in the conducting chain, hence the maximum steady-state high at the output is\n$$\nV_{\\text{out,high}} = V_{DD} - V_{Tn} = 1.0 - 0.35 = 0.65\\,\\mathrm{V}.\n$$\nSince $0.65\\,\\mathrm{V} \\geq V_{\\min} = 0.60\\,\\mathrm{V}$, the steady-state constraint is satisfied for any TG placement.\n\nNext, to compare dynamic delays across TG placements, we model the enabled series chain as resistors $R_{1}$, $R_{2}$, and $R_{3}$ from source to output, with shunt capacitors $C$ at the first internal node, $C$ at the second internal node, and $C_{L}$ at the output. For a step input at the source of a tree-structured RC network, the first moment of the output step response (the Elmore delay) can be derived from linear system theory by noting that the first moment of the impulse response equals the sum over capacitors of the resistance from the source to each capacitor multiplied by that capacitor.
