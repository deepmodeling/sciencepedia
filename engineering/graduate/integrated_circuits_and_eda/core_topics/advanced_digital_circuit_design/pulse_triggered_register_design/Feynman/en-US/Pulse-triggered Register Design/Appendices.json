A wider pulse allows for more time borrowing, benefiting slow data paths, but it also increases the risk of hold-time violations on fast paths.

            "problem": "Consider a pipeline composed of identical pulse-triggered registers (PTRs), where each PTR is implemented as a level-sensitive latch driven by a narrow clock pulse of width $T_{p}$ generated around the rising edge. The launch register becomes transparent during $[0, T_{p}]$ of a cycle, and the capture register becomes transparent during $[T_{\\text{clk}}, T_{\\text{clk}} + T_{p}]$, where $T_{\\text{clk}}$ is the cycle time. Assume single-phase operation, and that time borrowing is permitted up to the transparent interval of the capture PTR. The workload that exercises the pipeline has a distribution of combinational path delays between adjacent PTRs, with a maximum delay $D_{\\max}$ and a minimum delay $D_{\\min}$.\n\nUse only the following foundational definitions and widely accepted timing facts as the basis for your formulation:\n- The data launched by the launch PTR with maximum clock-to-$Q$ delay $t_{cq}^{\\max}$ traverses a path of delay $D$ and must be captured by the end of the capture PTR’s transparency window minus the setup time $t_{su}$ and a setup margin $s_{\\text{setup}}$ that accounts for clock uncertainty, yielding a cycle-time lower bound from setup considerations.\n- The short-path robustness requirement forbids any two-register transparency chain in the presence of the fastest data propagation. In single-phase pulsed latch pipelines with worst-case negative clock skew $\\delta$ (capture opening early relative to launch), the separation between the end of the launch pulse and the beginning of the capture pulse must be at least the earliest data arrival at the capture input, which is the sum of the minimum clock-to-$Q$ delay $t_{cq}^{\\min}$, the minimum path delay $D_{\\min}$, and the capture hold time $t_{h}$.\n\nYou are given the following parameters for a specific workload and technology corner, all expressed in picoseconds (ps):\n- Maximum combinational path delay: $D_{\\max} = 820$ ps.\n- Minimum combinational path delay: $D_{\\min} = 180$ ps.\n- Maximum clock-to-$Q$ delay: $t_{cq}^{\\max} = 55$ ps.\n- Minimum clock-to-$Q$ delay: $t_{cq}^{\\min} = 40$ ps.\n- Setup time: $t_{su} = 20$ ps.\n- Setup margin: $s_{\\text{setup}} = 10$ ps.\n- Capture hold time: $t_{h} = 10$ ps.\n- Worst-case negative clock skew: $\\delta = 60$ ps.\n- Feasible pulse-width range due to the pulse generator and latch internal constraints: $T_{p} \\in [150, 350]$ ps.\n\nFormulate, from the above base definitions, a constrained optimization problem over the pulse width $T_{p}$ that minimizes the required cycle time $T_{\\text{clk}}$ while satisfying the short-path robustness constraint for the given workload. Solve this problem to obtain the optimal pulse width $T_{p}^{\\star}$ within the specified feasible range. Express your final answer in picoseconds (ps) and round to four significant figures.

The launch register is transparent during $[0, T_{p}]$ and the capture register during $[T_{\\text{clk}}, T_{\\text{clk}} + T_{p}]$.\n2.  **Hold (Short-Path) Constraint**: The separation between the end of the launch pulse and the beginning of the capture pulse must be at least the sum of the minimum clock-to-Q delay, the minimum path delay, and the capture hold time, considering a worst-case negative clock skew $\\delta$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is `scientifically grounded` in the principles of digital circuit timing analysis for latch-based pipelines. It is `well-posed` as it asks for the solution to a constrained optimization problem. The language is `objective` and precise. All necessary parameters are provided, making the problem `self-contained`, and there are no internal contradictions. While the phrasing of the hold constraint definition is slightly unorthodox from a grammatical standpoint, its mathematical meaning is explicitly defined. The problem requires strict adherence to these given definitions, which is a standard feature of a formal problem. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\n### Step 3: Formulate and Solve the Optimization Problem\n\nThe objective is to minimize $T_{\\text{clk}}$ by choosing an optimal $T_{p}$ from the interval $[150, 350]$. This requires formulating the constraints on $T_{\\text{clk}}$ as functions of $T_{p}$.\n\n**1. Setup Constraint Formulation**\nThe setup constraint ensures that the slowest data path has enough time to propagate and be safely captured.\n- The latest data is launched from the launch register at time $t_{cq}^{\\max}$ after the clock edge at time $0$.\n- The data traverses the longest combinational logic path, taking $D_{\\max}$ time.\n- The latest arrival time of data at the capture register's input is $t_{\\text{arrival}}^{\\max} = t_{cq}^{\\max} + D_{\\max}$.\n- The capture register is transparent during the interval $[T_{\\text{clk}}, T_{\\text{clk}} + T_{p}]$.\n- To be safely captured, the data must be stable at the input for a duration of $t_{su}$ before the latch closes (i.e., the end of the transparency window), plus a safety margin $s_{\\text{setup}}$. The capture deadline is therefore $t_{\\text{deadline}} = (T_{\\text{clk}} + T_{p}) - t_{su} - s_{\\text{setup}}$.\n- The setup constraint is $t_{\\text{arrival}}^{\\max} \\le t_{\\text{deadline}}$.\n$$t_{cq}^{\\max} + D_{\\max} \\le T_{\\text{clk}} + T_{p} - t_{su} - s_{\\text{setup}}$$\nRearranging for $T_{\\text{clk}}$ gives the first lower bound for the cycle time:\n$$T_{\\text{clk}} \\ge t_{cq}^{\\max} + D_{\\max} - T_{p} + t_{su} + s_{\\text{setup}}$$\n\n**2. Hold Constraint Formulation**\nThe hold constraint (or short-path constraint) prevents data from the fastest path from racing through and corrupting the data at the capture latch. We must use the definition provided in the problem statement.\n- The launch pulse ends at time $T_{p}$.\n- The capture pulse begins nominally at $T_{\\text{clk}}$. With worst-case negative skew $\\delta$, the capture clock arrives early, so the capture pulse begins at $T_{\\text{clk}} - \\delta$.\n- The separation between the end of the launch pulse and the beginning of the capture pulse is $(T_{\\text{clk}} - \\delta) - T_{p}$.\n- The problem defines the minimum required separation as the sum of $t_{cq}^{\\min}$, $D_{\\min}$, and $t_{h}$.\n- The hold constraint is therefore:\n$$(T_{\\text{clk}} - \\delta) - T_{p} \\ge t_{cq}^{\\min} + D_{\\min} + t_{h}$$\nRearranging for $T_{\\text{clk}}$ gives the second lower bound for the cycle time:\n$$T_{\\text{clk}} \\ge T_{p} + t_{cq}^{\\min} + D_{\\min} + \\delta + t_{h}$$\n\n**3. Optimization Problem**\nTo satisfy both constraints, $T_{\\text{clk}}$ must be greater than or equal to the maximum of these two lower bounds:\n$$T_{\\text{clk}}(T_{p}) \\ge \\max\\left( t_{cq}^{\\max} + D_{\\max} - T_{p} + t_{su} + s_{\\text{setup}}, \\quad T_{p} + t_{cq}^{\\min} + D_{\\min} + \\delta + t_{h} \\right)$$\nTo minimize $T_{\\text{clk}}$, we must find the value of $T_{p}$ in the range $[150, 350]$ that minimizes this expression. Let's define two linear functions of $T_{p}$:\n- $f_1(T_{p}) = (t_{cq}^{\\max} + D_{\\max} + t_{su} + s_{\\text{setup}}) - T_{p}$ (decreasing function)\n- $f_2(T_{p}) = (t_{cq}^{\\min} + D_{\\min} + \\delta + t_{h}) + T_{p}$ (increasing function)\n\nLet's first substitute the given values to find the constants:\n- Constant part of $f_1$: $C_1 = 55 + 820 + 20 + 10 = 905 \\text{ ps}$. So, $f_1(T_{p}) = 905 - T_{p}$.\n- Constant part of $f_2$: $C_2 = 40 + 180 + 60 + 10 = 290 \\text{ ps}$. So, $f_2(T_{p}) = 290 + T_{p}$.\n\nWe need to minimize $T_{\\text{clk}}(T_p) = \\max(905 - T_{p}, 290 + T_{p})$ for $T_p \\in [150, 350]$.\nThe minimum of the maximum of a decreasing and an increasing function occurs at their intersection, provided the intersection point is within the feasible domain. Let's find this intersection point, which we denote $T_{p}^{\\text{unc}}$ (unconstrained optimum):\n$$f_1(T_{p}^{\\text{unc}}) = f_2(T_{p}^{\\text{unc}})$$\n$$905 - T_{p}^{\\text{unc}} = 290 + T_{p}^{\\text{unc}}$$\n$$2 T_{p}^{\\text{unc}} = 905 - 290$$\n$$2 T_{p}^{\\text{unc}} = 615$$\n$$T_{p}^{\\text{unc}} = 307.5 \\text{ ps}$$\n\nNow, we check if this unconstrained optimal value lies within the feasible range for $T_{p}$:\n$$150 \\text{ ps} \\le 307.5 \\text{ ps} \\le 350 \\text{ ps}$$\nThe condition is satisfied. Therefore, the optimal pulse width $T_{p}^{\\star}$ that minimizes the cycle time is $307.5 \\text{ ps}$.\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $307.5$ already has four significant figures.\n\nThe optimal pulse width is $T_{p}^{\\star} = 307.5 \\text{ ps}$.",
