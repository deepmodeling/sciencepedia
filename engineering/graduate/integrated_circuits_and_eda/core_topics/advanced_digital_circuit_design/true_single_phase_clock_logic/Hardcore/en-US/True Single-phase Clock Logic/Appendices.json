            "problem": "A True Single-Phase Clock (TSPC) dynamic logic gate in Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) technology uses a single global clock to alternate between precharge and evaluate. During evaluation, a weak keeper device maintains the dynamic node against leakage but also contends with the evaluation network, creating an opposing current that slows the discharge of the dynamic node and increases energy consumption from the power supply. Consider a TSPC gate whose dynamic storage node is modeled as a capacitor of value $C_{\\mathrm{dyn}}$ driven by an evaluation network that provides a nominal discharge current $I_{\\mathrm{eval}}$ and opposed by a keeper device that sources a current $I_{\\mathrm{keeper}}$ into the same node. Assume both $I_{\\mathrm{eval}}$ and $I_{\\mathrm{keeper}}$ are approximately constant over the relevant voltage excursion, the load seen by the node is purely capacitive and included in $C_{\\mathrm{dyn}}$, and the inverter that senses the node has a switching threshold $V_{\\mathrm{M}}$. The node begins evaluation at $V_{\\mathrm{dd}}$ and must traverse a voltage interval $\\Delta V = V_{\\mathrm{dd}} - V_{\\mathrm{M}}$ for a valid logic transition.\n\nStarting from Kirchhoff’s current law and the capacitor current-voltage relation, derive an expression for the contention-limited evaluation time $\\Delta t$ required for the node to traverse $\\Delta V$ under the opposing keeper current.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. It describes a standard, albeit simplified, model of a True Single-Phase Clock (TSPC) dynamic logic gate, which is a fundamental topic in digital integrated circuit design. All given parameters are physically realistic. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nFirst, we address the qualitative effects of keeper contention. In a TSPC dynamic logic gate, the evaluation phase involves discharging a dynamic node, represented by the capacitor $C_{\\mathrm{dyn}}$, through a pull-down network of transistors (the evaluation network). A weak keeper device, typically a PMOS transistor, is included to counteract charge loss due to leakage currents when the evaluation network is off, thus preserving the logic state. However, during an active evaluation, this keeper remains weakly on, sourcing a small current $I_{\\mathrm{keeper}}$ from the power supply $V_{\\mathrm{dd}}$ onto the dynamic node.\n\nThis keeper current has two primary consequences:\n1.  **Increased Delay**: The keeper current $I_{\\mathrm{keeper}}$ directly opposes the discharge current $I_{\\mathrm{eval}}$ provided by the evaluation network. The net current available to discharge the capacitor $C_{\\mathrm{dyn}}$ is reduced to $I_{\\mathrm{net}} = I_{\\mathrm{eval}} - I_{\\mathrm{keeper}}$. According to the fundamental capacitor relationship $I = C \\frac{dV}{dt}$, a smaller net current implies a lower rate of voltage change $\\frac{dV}{dt}$. Consequently, it takes a longer time $\\Delta t$ for the node voltage to fall by the required amount $\\Delta V$, leading to an increase in the gate's evaluation delay.\n2.  **Increased Dynamic Power Consumption**: During the evaluation period, with both the evaluation network and the keeper device active, a direct path is formed from the power supply $V_{\\mathrm{dd}}$ through the keeper and the evaluation network to ground. The current flowing through this path is $I_{\\mathrm{keeper}}$. This is a form of short-circuit current that dissipates power, given by $P_{\\mathrm{sc}} = V_{\\mathrm{dd}} I_{\\mathrm{keeper}}$. This power dissipation occurs for the duration of the evaluation, $\\Delta t$, contributing an additional energy component $E_{\\mathrm{sc}} = V_{\\mathrm{dd}} I_{\\mathrm{keeper}} \\Delta t$ to the total dynamic energy consumption per switching cycle.\n\nNow, we derive the expression for the evaluation time $\\Delta t$. Let $v_o(t)$ be the voltage on the dynamic node. By applying Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL) to the dynamic node, the sum of currents leaving the node must be zero. The current leaving the node through the capacitor is $I_C$. The evaluation network sinks a current $I_{\\mathrm{eval}}$ from the node (current leaving), and the keeper sources a current $I_{\\mathrm{keeper}}$ into the node (current entering).\n\nWe can write the KCL equation for the currents leaving the node as:\n$$I_C + I_{\\mathrm{eval}} - I_{\\mathrm{keeper}} = 0$$\nThe current-voltage relationship for the capacitor is $I_C = C_{\\mathrm{dyn}} \\frac{dv_o(t)}{dt}$. Substituting this into the KCL equation yields:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{dyn}} \\frac{dv_o(t)}{dt} + I_{\\mathrm{eval}} - I_{\\mathrm{keeper}} = 0$$\nRearranging for the rate of voltage change, we get:\n$$\\frac{dv_o(t)}{dt} = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{keeper}} - I_{\\mathrm{eval}}}{C_{\\mathrm{dyn}}}$$\nTo find the total time $\\Delta t$ required for the voltage to change from its initial value $v_o(0) = V_{\\mathrm{dd}}$ to the final switching threshold $v_o(\\Delta t) = V_{\\mathrm{M}}$, we separate variables and integrate. The problem assumes $I_{\\mathrm{eval}}$ and $I_{\\mathrm{keeper}}$ are constant over this voltage range.\n$$\\int_{V_{\\mathrm{dd}}}^{V_{\\mathrm{M}}} dv_o = \\int_{0}^{\\Delta t} \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{keeper}} - I_{\\mathrm{eval}}}{C_{\\mathrm{dyn}}} dt$$\nPerforming the integration gives:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{M}} - V_{\\mathrm{dd}} = \\left( \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{keeper}} - I_{\\mathrm{eval}}}{C_{\\mathrm{dyn}}} \\right) \\Delta t$$\nThe problem defines the required voltage traversal as $\\Delta V = V_{\\mathrm{dd}} - V_{\\mathrm{M}}$, so $V_{\\mathrm{M}} - V_{\\mathrm{dd}} = -\\Delta V$. Substituting this in:\n$$-\\Delta V = \\left( \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{keeper}} - I_{\\mathrm{eval}}}{C_{\\mathrm{dyn}}} \\right) \\Delta t$$\nFinally, we solve for the evaluation time $\\Delta t$:\n$$\\Delta t = \\frac{-C_{\\mathrm{dyn}} \\Delta V}{I_{\\mathrm{keeper}} - I_{\\mathrm{eval}}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{dyn}} \\Delta V}{I_{\\mathrm{eval}} - I_{\\mathrm{keeper}}}$$\nThis is the desired expression for the contention-limited evaluation time.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $\\Delta t$ using the provided parameters:\n$V_{\\mathrm{dd}} = 0.80\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n$V_{\\mathrm{M}} = 0.32\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n$C_{\\mathrm{dyn}} = 3.18\\,\\mathrm{fF} = 3.18 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{F}$\n$I_{\\mathrm{eval}} = 62\\,\\mu\\mathrm{A} = 62 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{A}$\n$I_{\\mathrm{keeper}} = 13\\,\\mu\\mathrm{A} = 13 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{A}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the voltage swing $\\Delta V$:\n$$\\Delta V = V_{\\mathrm{dd}} - V_{\\mathrm{M}} = 0.80\\,\\mathrm{V} - 0.32\\,\\mathrm{V} = 0.48\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nNext, we calculate the net discharge current, which is the difference between the evaluation current and the opposing keeper current:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{net}} = I_{\\mathrm{eval}} - I_{\\mathrm{keeper}} = 62 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{A} - 13 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{A} = 49 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{A}$$\nNow, we substitute these values into our derived expression for $\\Delta t$:\n$$\\Delta t = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{dyn}} \\Delta V}{I_{\\mathrm{eval}} - I_{\\mathrm{keeper}}} = \\frac{(3.18 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{F}) \\times (0.48\\,\\mathrm{V})}{49 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{A}}$$\nCalculating the result:\n$$\\Delta t = \\frac{1.5264 \\times 10^{-15}}{49 \\times 10^{-6}} \\,\\mathrm{s} \\approx 0.03115102 \\times 10^{-9} \\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nThe problem requires the answer in picoseconds ($1\\,\\mathrm{ps} = 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{s}$).\n$$\\Delta t \\approx 31.15102 \\times 10^{-12} \\,\\mathrm{s} = 31.15102\\,\\mathrm{ps}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\\Delta t = 31.15\\,\\mathrm{ps}$$",

This must occur during $t_{high} = \\alpha T$.\n\n- **Stage 2 ($V_Y$)**:\n  - Precharge (on $\\phi=1$): $t_{precharge,2} \\geq 2.3026\\,\\tau_{p2} = 2.3026 \\times 3\\,\\text{ns} = 6.9078\\,\\text{ns}$. This must occur during $t_{high} = \\alpha T$.\n  - Evaluate (on $\\phi=0$): $t_{evaluate,2} > 0.9163\\,\\tau_{e2} = 0.9163 \\times 3\\,\\text{ns} = 2.7489\\,\\text{ns}$. This must occur during $t_{low} = (1-\\alpha)T$.\n\nNow, we analyze the two specified cases for duty cycle $\\alpha$. The clock period is $T=12\\,\\text{ns}$.\n\n**Case 1: $\\alpha = 0.8$**\n- The duration of $\\phi=1$ is $t_{high} = \\alpha T = 0.8 \\times 12\\,\\text{ns} = 9.6\\,\\text{ns}$.\n- The duration of $\\phi=0$ is $t_{low} = (1-\\alpha)T = 0.2 \\times 12\\,\\text{ns} = 2.4\\,\\text{ns}$.\n\n- **Stage 1 ($V_X$) check**:\n  - Precharge: Needs $t_{low} \\geq 2.3026\\,\\text{ns}$. Available time is $2.4\\,\\text{ns}$. Since $2.4\\,\\text{ns} \\geq 2.3026\\,\\text{ns}$, the condition is **met**.\n  - Evaluate: Needs $t_{high} > 1.8326\\,\\text{ns}$. Available time is $9.6\\,\\text{ns}$. Since $9.6\\,\\text{ns} > 1.8326\\,\\text{ns}$, the condition is **met**.\n- **Stage 2 ($V_Y$) check**:\n  - Precharge: Needs $t_{high} \\geq 6.9078\\,\\text{ns}$. Available time is $9.6\\,\\text{ns}$. Since $9.6\\,\\text{ns} \\geq 6.9078\\,\\text{ns}$, the condition is **met**.\n  - Evaluate: Needs $t_{low} > 2.7489\\,\\text{ns}$. Available time is $2.4\\,\\text{ns}$. Since $2.4\\,\\text{ns} \\ngtr 2.7489\\,\\text{ns}$, the condition is **not met**. $V_Y$ **fails** to evaluate correctly.\n\n**Case 2: $\\alpha = 0.2$**\n- The duration of $\\phi=1$ is $t_{high} = \\alpha T = 0.2 \\times 12\\,\\text{ns} = 2.4\\,\\text{ns}$.\n- The duration of $\\phi=0$ is $t_{low} = (1-\\alpha)T = 0.8 \\times 12\\,\\text{ns} = 9.6\\,\\text{ns}$.\n\n- **Stage 1 ($V_X$) check**:\n  - Precharge: Needs $t_{low} \\geq 2.3026\\,\\text{ns}$. Available time is $9.6\\,\\text{ns}$. Since $9.6\\,\\text{ns} \\geq 2.3026\\,\\text{ns}$, the condition is **met**.\n  - Evaluate: Needs $t_{high} > 1.8326\\,\\text{ns}$. Available time is $2.4\\,\\text{ns}$. Since $2.4\\,\\text{ns} > 1.8326\\,\\text{ns}$, the condition is **met**.\n- **Stage 2 ($V_Y$) check**:\n  - Precharge: Needs $t_{high} \\geq 6.9078\\,\\text{ns}$. Available time is $2.4\\,\\text{ns}$. Since $2.4\\,\\text{ns} \\not\\geq 6.9078\\,\\text{ns}$, the condition is **not met**. $V_Y$ **fails** to precharge correctly.\n  - Evaluate: Needs $t_{low} > 2.7489\\,\\text{ns}$. Available time is $9.6\\,\\text{ns}$. Since $9.6\\,\\text{ns} > 2.7489\\,\\text{ns}$, the condition is **met**.\n\n**Summary of Failures**:\n- For $\\alpha = 0.8$, node $V_Y$ fails to evaluate because the low phase of the clock ($t_{low} = 2.4\\,\\text{ns}$) is too short.\n- For $\\alpha = 0.2$, node $V_Y$ fails to precharge because the high phase of the clock ($t_{high} = 2.4\\,\\text{ns}$) is too short.\n- In both cases, node $V_X$ meets its timing requirements for both precharge and evaluation.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. For $\\alpha = 0.8$, $V_{Y}$ fails to evaluate (it remains above $V_{M}$ at the end of $\\phi = 0$), because $(1-\\alpha)T$ is too short; for $\\alpha = 0.2$, $V_{Y}$ fails to precharge to at least $0.9\\,V_{DD}$ by the end of $\\phi = 1$, because $\\alpha T$ is too short. $V_{X}$ meets both targets in both cases.**\nThis option perfectly matches the derived results.\n- For $\\alpha=0.8$, $t_{low} = (1-\\alpha)T$ is the evaluation time for $V_Y$. My analysis shows this phase is too short, causing an evaluation failure.\n- For $\\alpha=0.2$, $t_{high} = \\alpha T$ is the precharge time for $V_Y$. My analysis shows this phase is too short, causing a precharge failure.\n- My analysis also confirms $V_X$ meets its targets in both scenarios.\nTherefore, this statement is **Correct**.\n\n**B. For $\\alpha = 0.8$, $V_{X}$ fails to precharge to at least $0.9\\,V_{DD}$ by the end of $\\phi = 0$, and for $\\alpha = 0.2$, $V_{X}$ fails to discharge below $V_{M}$ by the end of $\\phi = 1$. $V_{Y}$ meets both targets in both cases.**\nThis option claims that $V_X$ fails and $V_Y$ succeeds. My analysis shows the opposite: $V_X$ succeeds and $V_Y$ fails. For $\\alpha=0.8$, $V_X$ precharge requires $t_{low} \\geq 2.3026\\,\\text{ns}$ and has $2.4\\,\\text{ns}$, so it passes. For $\\alpha=0.2$, $V_X$ evaluation requires $t_{high} > 1.8326\\,\\text{ns}$ and has $2.4\\,\\text{ns}$, so it passes. The statement is factually wrong on all points.\nTherefore, this statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. For $\\alpha = 0.8$, both $V_{X}$ and $V_{Y}$ fail their respective targets; for $\\alpha = 0.2$, neither node fails.**\nThis option is incorrect. For a duty cycle of $\\alpha=0.8$, my analysis shows only $V_Y$ fails, not $V_X$. For $\\alpha=0.2$, my analysis shows $V_Y$ fails. The statement is factually wrong for both cases.\nTherefore, this statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Duty cycle imbalance does not cause loss of state in TSPC logic; at worst it increases propagation delay while all nodes still meet their targets provided $T$ is fixed.**\nThis is a general claim that is fundamentally incorrect for dynamic logic circuits. Duty cycle imbalance directly shortens one of the clock phases. If this shortened phase is less than the time required for a node to precharge or evaluate to a valid logic level, a functional failure (loss of state) will occur, not just a delay increase. The calculations performed for this specific problem demonstrate exactly this failure mechanism.\nTherefore, this statement is **Incorrect**.",
