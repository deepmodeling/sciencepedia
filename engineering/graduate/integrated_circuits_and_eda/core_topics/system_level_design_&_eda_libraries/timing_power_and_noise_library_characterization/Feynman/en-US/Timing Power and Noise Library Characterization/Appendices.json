            "problem": "A standard-cell inverter is being characterized for timing, power, and noise in a library environment. The output load comprises an on-chip capacitance and a package inductance, producing an underdamped response with overshoot and undershoot at the output node. The supply is $V_\\mathrm{DD}$. Let the input be a monotone rising transition. In the characterization bench, delay and slew are defined from first principles as follows: the propagation delay is the difference between the time the input crosses the $50\\%$ threshold and the time the output crosses the $50\\%$ threshold, and the output slew is the time difference between the output crossing the $20\\%$ threshold and the output crossing the $80\\%$ threshold. In an ideal monotone output, these crossings are unique. However, with ringing, $v_\\mathrm{out}(t)$ can cross the same threshold multiple times, inducing ambiguity.\n\nConsider the following measured crossing times for the rising output of one characterization run, where $t_{p}^{(k)}$ denotes the time of the $k$-th crossing of the $p\\cdot V_\\mathrm{DD}$ threshold by $v_\\mathrm{out}(t)$, with upward crossings denoted by increasing $v_\\mathrm{out}(t)$ and downward crossings by decreasing $v_\\mathrm{out}(t)$:\n- Input $50\\%$ crossing time: $t_\\mathrm{in,50} = 10\\,\\mathrm{ps}$.\n- Output $20\\%$ upward crossings: $t_{20}^{(1)} = 21\\,\\mathrm{ps}$; later the waveform rings down below $20\\%$ at $40\\,\\mathrm{ps}$; the next upward crossing after which the waveform remains above $20\\%$ is $t_{20}^{(2)} = 52\\,\\mathrm{ps}$.\n- Output $50\\%$ crossings: $t_{50}^{(1)} = 28\\,\\mathrm{ps}$ (up); $t_{50}^{(2)} = 38\\,\\mathrm{ps}$ (down); $t_{50}^{(3)} = 55\\,\\mathrm{ps}$ (up), after which $v_\\mathrm{out}(t)$ stays above $50\\%$.\n- Output $80\\%$ upward crossings: $t_{80}^{(1)} = 30\\,\\mathrm{ps}$; later the waveform rings down below $80\\%$ at $45\\,\\mathrm{ps}$; the next upward crossing after which the waveform remains above $80\\%$ is $t_{80}^{(2)} = 58\\,\\mathrm{ps}$.\n\nSuppose a naive measurement algorithm takes the earliest crossing at each threshold, i.e., uses $t_{50}^{(1)}$ for delay and $(t_{80}^{(1)} - t_{20}^{(1)})$ for slew. In contrast, a robust measurement must avoid ambiguity caused by transient crossings associated with ringing. Starting from the foundational definitions above and the physical reality that logic is defined by sustained voltage levels rather than transient excursions, analyze the error induced by the naive algorithm relative to a robust criterion that ensures the final logic state is actually achieved and retained. Then, determine which proposal among the options provides both the correct quantitative error assessment for this dataset and a principled, implementable definition that resolves ambiguity in the presence of overshoot and undershoot.\n\nChoose the correct option.\n\nA.

The concepts of propagation delay, slew rate, and the challenge of measuring them on non-monotonic waveforms are fundamental topics in library characterization for Electronic Design Automation (EDA). The principles are sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** All necessary data points (crossing times) are provided to calculate delay and slew according to both the \"naive\" and a \"robust\" interpretation. The term \"robust\" is sufficiently constrained by the principle of \"sustained voltage levels,\" which unambiguously points to using the final crossing times provided in the data. A unique solution is derivable.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, standard terminology from the field of integrated circuit design. The provided data is quantitative and objective.\n- **Flaw Checklist:**\n    1.  Scientific/Factual Unsoundness: None.\n    2.  Non-Formalizable/Irrelevant: The problem is highly relevant to its stated field.\n    3.  Incomplete/Contradictory Setup: The sequence of crossing times for the initial rising edge ($t_{20}^{(1)} < t_{50}^{(1)} < t_{80}^{(1)}$) and the final settling edge ($t_{20}^{(2)} < t_{50}^{(3)} < t_{80}^{(2)}$) are chronologically consistent with a physical waveform.

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\n\nThe problem requires a comparison between a naive measurement and a robust one. We will calculate the propagation delay and output slew for both cases and then find the error.\n\n**1. Naive Algorithm Calculation**\nThe naive algorithm uses the earliest crossing time for each voltage threshold.\n\n- **Naive Propagation Delay ($\\tau_{pd,\\text{naive}}$):**\n  The input crosses $50\\%$ at $t_\\mathrm{in,50} = 10\\,\\mathrm{ps}$.\n  The earliest output $50\\%$ crossing is $t_{50}^{(1)} = 28\\,\\mathrm{ps}$.\n  $$ \\tau_{pd,\\text{naive}} = t_{50}^{(1)} - t_\\mathrm{in,50} = 28\\,\\mathrm{ps} - 10\\,\\mathrm{ps} = 18\\,\\mathrm{ps} $$\n\n- **Naive Output Slew ($\\tau_{slew,\\text{naive}}$):**\n  The earliest output $20\\%$ crossing is $t_{20}^{(1)} = 21\\,\\mathrm{ps}$.\n  The earliest output $80\\%$ crossing is $t_{80}^{(1)} = 30\\,\\mathrm{ps}$.\n  The slew is defined for the $20\\%\\text{–}80\\%$ interval.\n  $$ \\tau_{slew,\\text{naive}} = t_{80}^{(1)} - t_{20}^{(1)} = 30\\,\\mathrm{ps} - 21\\,\\mathrm{ps} = 9\\,\\mathrm{ps} $$\n\n**2. Robust Algorithm Calculation**\nA robust measurement must reflect the time at which the output achieves a stable, final logic state. This means we must use the last crossing time for each threshold, after which the voltage does not recross back through the threshold. The problem explicitly provides these times.\n\n- **Robust Propagation Delay ($\\tau_{pd,\\text{robust}}$):**\n  The input crosses $50\\%$ at $t_\\mathrm{in,50} = 10\\,\\mathrm{ps}$.\n  The final upward $50\\%$ crossing, after which $v_\\mathrm{out}(t)$ remains above $50\\%$, is $t_{50}^{(3)} = 55\\,\\mathrm{ps}$.\n  $$ \\tau_{pd,\\text{robust}} = t_{50}^{(3)} - t_\\mathrm{in,50} = 55\\,\\mathrm{ps} - 10\\,\\mathrm{ps} = 45\\,\\mathrm{ps} $$\n\n- **Robust Output Slew ($\\tau_{slew,\\text{robust}}$):**\n  The final upward $20\\%$ crossing is $t_{20}^{(2)} = 52\\,\\mathrm{ps}$.\n  The final upward $80\\%$ crossing is $t_{80}^{(2)} = 58\\,\\mathrm{ps}$.\n  $$ \\tau_{slew,\\text{robust}} = t_{80}^{(2)} - t_{20}^{(2)} = 58\\,\\mathrm{ps} - 52\\,\\mathrm{ps} = 6\\,\\mathrm{ps} $$\n\n**3. Error Assessment**\nThe error is the difference between the robust (correct) value and the naive (erroneous) value. A positive error indicates the naive algorithm underestimates the value, while a negative error indicates an overestimation.\n\n- **Delay Error:**\n  $$ \\text{Error}_{pd} = \\tau_{pd,\\text{robust}} - \\tau_{pd,\\text{naive}} = 45\\,\\mathrm{ps} - 18\\,\\mathrm{ps} = 27\\,\\mathrm{ps} $$\n  Since the error is positive, the naive algorithm **underestimates** the delay by $27\\,\\mathrm{ps}$.\n\n- **Slew Error:**\n  $$ \\text{Error}_{slew} = \\tau_{slew,\\text{robust}} - \\tau_{slew,\\text{naive}} = 6\\,\\mathrm{ps} - 9\\,\\mathrm{ps} = -3\\,\\mathrm{ps} $$\n  Since the error is negative, the naive algorithm **overestimates** the slew time by $3\\,\\mathrm{ps}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nNow we evaluate each option based on the calculated errors and the validity of the proposed robust method.\n\n**A. The naive algorithm underestimates the delay by $27\\,\\mathrm{ps}$ and overestimates the $20\\text{–}80\\%$ slew by $3\\,\\mathrm{ps}$. A robust approach is to use a persistence-based first-passage criterion: define the crossing time at a threshold as the earliest time at which $v_\\mathrm{out}(t)$ enters the target logic region and does not recross for at least a hold time $\\tau_\\mathrm{hold}$, and compute slew from the persistent $20\\%$ and $80\\%$ crossings.**\n- **Quantitative Assessment:** The delay error (underestimation by $27\\,\\mathrm{ps}$) and the slew error (overestimation by $3\\,\\mathrm{ps}$) match our calculations exactly.\n- **Robust Method Proposal:** The \"persistence-based first-passage criterion\" is a formal and principled method that directly addresses the problem of ringing. It ensures the signal is stable for a minimum duration ($\\tau_\\mathrm{hold}$), which is the essence of achieving a valid logic state. The \"last crossing\" method we used for calculation is a specific case of this criterion where $\\tau_\\mathrm{hold}$ is assumed to be longer than the remaining simulation window. This proposal is sound, implementable, and standard industry practice.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. The naive algorithm underestimates the delay by $10\\,\\mathrm{ps}$ and underestimates the $20\\text{–}80\\%$ slew by $3\\,\\mathrm{ps}$. A robust approach is to use the crossing with maximum slope magnitude $\\left|\\mathrm{d}v_\\mathrm{out}/\\mathrm{d}t\\right|$ to define delay and to define slew as the reciprocal of $\\left|\\mathrm{d}v_\\mathrm{out}/\\mathrm{d}t\\right|$ at $50\\%$.**\n- **Quantitative Assessment:** The delay error is stated as $10\\,\\mathrm{ps}$, which is incorrect (it is $27\\,\\mathrm{ps}$). The slew error is stated as an underestimation of $3\\,\\mathrm{ps}$, which is also incorrect (it is an overestimation of $3\\,\\mathrm{ps}$).\n- **Robust Method Proposal:** Using the maximum slope crossing often corresponds to the initial, fastest transition, effectively replicating the naive measurement for typical ringing waveforms. More importantly, redefining slew based on the slope at a single point ($50\\%$) contradicts the problem's explicit definition of slew as a time interval between two thresholds ($20\\%\\text{–}80\\%$). This proposal is inconsistent with the problem setup.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The naive algorithm incurs no delay error and overestimates the $20\\text{–}80\\%$ slew by $9\\,\\mathrm{ps}$. A robust approach is to average all crossing times for each threshold to remove ringing effects.**\n- **Quantitative Assessment:** Stating \"no delay error\" is false ($27\\,\\mathrm{ps}$ error exists). The slew error is stated as an overestimation of $9\\,\\mathrm{ps}$, which is false (it is $3\\,\\mathrm{ps}$).\n- **Robust Method Proposal:** Averaging upward and downward crossing times lacks any physical basis. A downward crossing represents a failure to maintain a high logic state, and averaging it with an upward crossing produces a time that corresponds to no specific event of physical significance in digital logic switching.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The naive algorithm underestimates the delay by $27\\,\\mathrm{ps}$ and underestimates the $20\\text{–}80\\%$ slew by $9\\,\\mathrm{ps}$. A robust approach is to low-pass filter $v_\\mathrm{out}(t)$ with cutoff $f_c=\\omega_d/(2\\pi)$, where $\\omega_d$ is the damped natural frequency, and then measure thresholds on the filtered waveform.**\n- **Quantitative Assessment:** The delay error (underestimation by $27\\,\\mathrm{ps}$) is correct. However, the slew error is stated as an underestimation of $9\\,\\mathrm{ps}$, which is incorrect both in magnitude and sign (it is an overestimation of $3\\,\\mathrm{ps}$).\n- **Robust Method Proposal:** Low-pass filtering the waveform to remove the high-frequency ringing component is a valid and physically motivated engineering approach. Measuring thresholds on the resulting monotonic waveform would resolve the ambiguity. This proposed method is principled and implementable. However, the option fails because its quantitative assessment of the slew error is wrong.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the analysis, only option A provides both the correct quantitative error assessment and a valid, principled definition for a robust measurement.",

Mastering this allows you to understand the accuracy limitations of the library models you work with, a key skill for advanced model validation .",

            "solution": "The problem is judged to be valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, self-contained, and consistent. The problem concerns standard techniques in numerical analysis applied to a well-understood problem in electronic design automation. We proceed with the solution, which is structured in three parts as requested.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Bilinear Interpolant\n\nThe principle of bilinear interpolation is to apply one-dimensional linear interpolation separably along each axis. We begin by defining one-dimensional linear interpolation. For a function $f(x)$ on an interval $[x_0, x_1]$, its linear interpolant $\\tilde{f}(x)$ is given by:\n$$\n\\tilde{f}(x) = f(x_0) \\frac{x_1 - x}{x_1 - x_0} + f(x_1) \\frac{x - x_0}{x_1 - x_0}\n$$\nThis can be expressed using a normalized coordinate or barycentric weight. Let $u = \\frac{x - x_0}{x_1 - x_0}$. Then $1-u = \\frac{x_1 - x}{x_1 - x_0}$, and for $x \\in [x_0, x_1]$, we have $u \\in [0, 1]$. The formula becomes:\n$$\n\\tilde{f}(u) = f(x_0) (1-u) + f(x_1)u\n$$\nTo construct the bilinear interpolant $\\tilde{d}(s,l)$ for the delay function $d(s,l)$ on the rectangle $[s_0, s_1] \\times [l_0, l_1]$, we apply this process iteratively.\n\nFirst, we interpolate along the $s$-axis for the fixed load values $l_0$ and $l_1$. Let $u = \\frac{s - s_0}{s_1 - s_0}$ be the normalized coordinate along the $s$-axis.\nThe interpolated delay along the bottom edge of the rectangle (where $l=l_0$) is:\n$$\n\\tilde{d}(s, l_0) = d(s_0, l_0) (1-u) + d(s_1, l_0) u\n$$\nThe interpolated delay along the top edge of the rectangle (where $l=l_1$) is:\n$$\n\\tilde{d}(s, l_1) = d(s_0, l_1) (1-u) + d(s_1, l_1) u\n$$\nThese two expressions give the (exact, since they are interpolants) values of the bilinear surface at the points $(s, l_0)$ and $(s, l_1)$.\n\nNext, we interpolate along the $l$-axis for an arbitrary $s \\in [s_0, s_1]$. Let $v = \\frac{l - l_0}{l_1 - l_0}$ be the normalized coordinate along the $l$-axis. The final interpolant $\\tilde{d}(s,l)$ is obtained by linearly interpolating between the values $\\tilde{d}(s, l_0)$ and $\\tilde{d}(s, l_1)$:\n$$\n\\tilde{d}(s, l) = \\tilde{d}(s, l_0) (1-v) + \\tilde{d}(s, l_1) v\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\tilde{d}(s, l_0)$ and $\\tilde{d}(s, l_1)$:\n$$\n\\tilde{d}(s, l) = \\left[ d(s_0, l_0) (1-u) + d(s_1, l_0) u \\right] (1-v) + \\left[ d(s_0, l_1) (1-u) + d(s_1, l_1) u \\right] v\n$$\nExpanding this expression gives the bilinear interpolation formula in terms of the four corner values and the normalized barycentric weights $u$ and $v$:\n$$\n\\tilde{d}(s,l) = d(s_0, l_0) (1-u)(1-v) + d(s_1, l_0) u(1-v) + d(s_0, l_1) (1-u)v + d(s_1, l_1) uv\n$$\nThis is the required explicit formula. The normalized weights are $u = \\frac{s - s_0}{s_1 - s_0}$ and $v = \\frac{l - l_0}{l_1 - l_0}$.\n\n### Part 2: Derivation of the Error Bound\n\nThe interpolation error is $E(s,l) = d(s,l) - \\tilde{d}(s,l)$. To derive a bound for this error, we use Taylor's theorem with remainder for one-dimensional interpolation. The error of linearly interpolating a twice-differentiable function $f(x)$ on $[x_0, x_1]$ is given by:\n$$\nf(x) - \\tilde{f}(x) = \\frac{1}{2} f''(\\xi) (x-x_0)(x-x_1) \\quad \\text{for some } \\xi \\in (x_0, x_1)\n$$\nWe define an error function for a fixed $l$, $g(s) = d(s,l) - \\tilde{d}(s,l)$.\nThe error at the boundaries of the $s$-interval, $s=s_0$ and $s=s_1$, is not zero. At $s=s_0$, $\\tilde{d}(s_0,l)$ is the linear interpolant of $d(s_0,l_0)$ and $d(s_0,l_1)$. Thus, the error $g(s_0)$ is the one-dimensional interpolation error of $d(s_0, l)$ with respect to $l$:\n$$\ng(s_0) = d(s_0, l) - \\tilde{d}(s_0, l) = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 d}{\\partial l^2}(s_0, \\eta_0) (l-l_0)(l-l_1) \\quad \\text{for some } \\eta_0 \\in (l_0, l_1)\n$$\nSimilarly, at $s=s_1$:\n$$\ng(s_1) = d(s_1, l) - \\tilde{d}(s_1, l) = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 d}{\\partial l^2}(s_1, \\eta_1) (l-l_0)(l-l_1) \\quad \\text{for some } \\eta_1 \\in (l_0, l_1)\n$$\nLet $\\hat{g}(s)$ be the linear function that interpolates $g(s_0)$ and $g(s_1)$:\n$$\n\\hat{g}(s) = g(s_0) \\frac{s_1-s}{s_1-s_0} + g(s_1) \\frac{s-s_0}{s_1-s_0}\n$$\nThe total error can be written as $E(s,l) = g(s) = (g(s) - \\hat{g}(s)) + \\hat{g}(s)$. The function $e(s) = g(s) - \\hat{g}(s)$ is zero at $s=s_0$ and $s=s_1$. Therefore, we can apply the one-dimensional error formula to $e(s)$:\n$$\ne(s) = \\frac{1}{2} e''(\\xi_s) (s-s_0)(s-s_1) \\quad \\text{for some } \\xi_s \\in (s_0, s_1)\n$$\nWe need to find $e''(s) = g''(s) - \\hat{g}''(s)$. Since $\\hat{g}(s)$ is linear in $s$, its second derivative is zero. The bilinear interpolant $\\tilde{d}(s,l)$ is a linear function of $s$ for a fixed $l$, so $\\frac{\\partial^2 \\tilde{d}}{\\partial s^2} = 0$. Thus:\n$$\ng''(s) = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial s^2} (d(s,l) - \\tilde{d}(s,l)) = \\frac{\\partial^2 d}{\\partial s^2}(s,l)\n$$\nHence, $e''(s) = \\frac{\\partial^2 d}{\\partial s^2}(s,l)$. This gives:\n$$\ne(s) = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 d}{\\partial s^2}(\\xi_s, l) (s-s_0)(s-s_1)\n$$\nThe total error is $E(s,l) = e(s) + \\hat{g}(s)$. Substituting the expressions for each part:\n$$\nE(s,l) = \\frac{1}{2} (s-s_0)(s-s_1) \\frac{\\partial^2 d}{\\partial s^2}(\\xi_s, l) + \\frac{1}{2} (l-l_0)(l-l_1) \\left[ \\frac{\\partial^2 d}{\\partial l^2}(s_0, \\eta_0) \\frac{s_1-s}{h} + \\frac{\\partial^2 d}{\\partial l^2}(s_1, \\eta_1) \\frac{s-s_0}{h} \\right]\n$$\nwhere $h=s_1-s_0$. To find a uniform upper bound for $|E(s,l)|$, we use the triangle inequality and find the maximum absolute value of each term.\nThe term $|(s-s_0)(s-s_1)|$ is maximized at $s = (s_0+s_1)/2$, where its value is $h^2/4$.\nThe term $|(l-l_0)(l-l_1)|$ is maximized at $l = (l_0+l_1)/2$, where its value is $k^2/4$, with $k=l_1-l_0$.\nThe term in the square brackets is a convex combination of two values of $\\frac{\\partial^2 d}{\\partial l^2}$. Its absolute value is bounded by $\\sup \\left| \\frac{\\partial^2 d}{\\partial l^2} \\right| = B$.\nApplying these bounds and the given superstitions $A$ and $B$:\n$$\n|E(s,l)| \\le \\left| \\frac{1}{2} (s-s_0)(s-s_1) \\frac{\\partial^2 d}{\\partial s^2}(\\xi_s, l) \\right| + \\left| \\frac{1}{2} (l-l_0)(l-l_1) \\left[ \\dots \\right] \\right|\n$$\n$$\n|E(s,l)| \\le \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{h^2}{4}\\right) \\sup \\left|\\frac{\\partial^2 d}{\\partial s^2}\\right| + \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{k^2}{4}\\right) \\sup \\left|\\frac{\\partial^2 d}{\\partial l^2}\\right|\n$$\nThe uniform upper bound for the absolute interpolation error is therefore:\n$$\n|d(s,l) - \\tilde{d}(s,l)| \\le \\frac{A h^2}{8} + \\frac{B k^2}{8}\n$$\n\n### Part 3: Numerical Calculation\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- Slew interval: $[s_0, s_1] = [10\\,\\mathrm{ps}, 30\\,\\mathrm{ps}]$\n- Load interval: $[l_0, l_1] = [5\\,\\mathrm{fF}, 25\\,\\mathrm{fF}]$\n- Curvature bounds: $A = 1.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{ps}^{-1}$ and $B = 1.6 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{ps}\\,\\mathrm{fF}^{-2}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the spans $h$ and $k$:\n$$\nh = s_1 - s_0 = 30\\,\\mathrm{ps} - 10\\,\\mathrm{ps} = 20\\,\\mathrm{ps}\n$$\n$$\nk = l_1 - l_0 = 25\\,\\mathrm{fF} - 5\\,\\mathrm{fF} = 20\\,\\mathrm{fF}\n$$\nNow, we substitute these values into the error bound formula derived in Part 2.\nThe total error bound, denoted $E_{max}$, is:\n$$\nE_{max} = \\frac{A h^2}{8} + \\frac{B k^2}{8}\n$$\nLet's compute each term separately.\nThe component of the error from the slew ($s$) axis is:\n$$\nE_{s,max} = \\frac{A h^2}{8} = \\frac{(1.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{ps}^{-1}) (20\\,\\mathrm{ps})^2}{8} = \\frac{(1.2 \\times 10^{-3}) (400)}{8}\\,\\mathrm{ps} = \\frac{0.48}{8}\\,\\mathrm{ps} = 0.06\\,\\mathrm{ps}\n$$\nThe component of the error from the load ($l$) axis is:\n$$\nE_{l,max} = \\frac{B k^2}{8} = \\frac{(1.6 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{ps}\\,\\mathrm{fF}^{-2}) (20\\,\\mathrm{fF})^2}{8} = \\frac{(1.6 \\times 10^{-4}) (400)}{8}\\,\\mathrm{ps} = \\frac{0.064}{8}\\,\\mathrm{ps} = 0.008\\,\\mathrm{ps}\n$$\nThe total guaranteed least upper bound for the absolute error is the sum of these two components:\n$$\nE_{max} = E_{s,max} + E_{l,max} = 0.06\\,\\mathrm{ps} + 0.008\\,\\mathrm{ps} = 0.068\\,\\mathrm{ps}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n0.06800\\,\\mathrm{ps}\n$$",
