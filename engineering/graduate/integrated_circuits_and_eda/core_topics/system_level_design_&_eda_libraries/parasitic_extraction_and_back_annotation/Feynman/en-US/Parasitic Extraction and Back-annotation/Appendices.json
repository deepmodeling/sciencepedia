This is the worst-case scenario for delay. The slews $S_{ai}$ and $S_v$ have opposite signs, so the slew ratio is negative: $\\frac{S_{a1}}{S_v} = -r_1$ and $\\frac{S_{a2}}{S_v} = -r_2$.\nThe effective capacitance for Scenario B, $C_{\\mathrm{eff, B}}$, is:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{eff, B}} = C_g + C_{c1}(1 - (-r_1)) + C_{c2}(1 - (-r_2)) = C_g + C_{c1}(1 + r_1) + C_{c2}(1 + r_2)$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{eff, B}} = 12\\,\\mathrm{fF} + (6\\,\\mathrm{fF})(1 + 0.8) + (4\\,\\mathrm{fF})(1 + 0.5)$$\n$$C_{\\mathrm{eff, B}} = 12\\,\\mathrm{fF} + (6\\,\\mathrm{fF})(1.8) + (4\\,\\mathrm{fF})(1.5) = 12\\,\\mathrm{fF} + 10.8\\,\\mathrm{fF} + 6.0\\,\\mathrm{fF} = 28.8\\,\\mathrm{fF}$$\n\nThe time constants for the two scenarios are $\\tau_A = R_d C_{\\mathrm{eff, A}}$ and $\\tau_B = R_d C_{\\mathrm{eff, B}}$. The incremental delay impact is the difference between these time constants, $\\Delta\\tau$:\n$$\\Delta\\tau = \\tau_B - \\tau_A = R_d C_{\\mathrm{eff, B}} - R_d C_{\\mathrm{eff, A}} = R_d (C_{\\mathrm{eff, B}} - C_{\\mathrm{eff, A}})$$\nThe difference in effective capacitance is:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{eff, B}} - C_{\\mathrm{eff, A}} = [C_g + C_{c1}(1+r_1) + C_{c2}(1+r_2)] - [C_g + C_{c1}(1-r_1) + C_{c2}(1-r_2)]$$\n$$C_{\\mathrm{eff, B}} - C_{\\mathrm{eff, A}} = C_{c1}(1+r_1 - 1+r_1) + C_{c2}(1+r_2 - 1+r_2) = 2r_1C_{c1} + 2r_2C_{c2}$$\nSo, the incremental delay impact is:\n$$\\Delta\\tau = 2 R_d (r_1 C_{c1} + r_2 C_{c2})$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values: $R_d = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{k}\\Omega = 1.0 \\times 10^3\\,\\Omega$.\n$$\\Delta\\tau = 2 (1.0 \\times 10^3\\,\\Omega) \\left( (0.8)(6 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{F}) + (0.5)(4 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{F}) \\right)$$\n$$\\Delta\\tau = 2 \\times 10^3 \\left( 4.8 \\times 10^{-15} + 2.0 \\times 10^{-15} \\right) \\,\\mathrm{s}$$\n$$\\Delta\\tau = 2 \\times 10^3 \\left( 6.8 \\times 10^{-15} \\right) \\,\\mathrm{s}$$\n$$\\Delta\\tau = 13.6 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 13.6\\,\\mathrm{ps}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in picoseconds and rounded to four significant figures.\n$$13.6\\,\\mathrm{ps} = 13.60\\,\\mathrm{ps}$$",
