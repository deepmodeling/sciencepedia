            "introduction": "The foundation of any successful Delay-Locked Loop design is ensuring that its core component, the Voltage-Controlled Delay Line (VCDL), possesses an adequate tuning range. Before analyzing dynamic performance like lock time or jitter, a designer must first guarantee that the VCDL can physically generate a total delay equal to the target clock period. This fundamental practice  guides you through the first-principles calculation of a VCDL's tuning range and how to determine the minimum number of delay stages required to achieve lock for a given reference frequency.",

            "problem": "A Voltage-Controlled Delay Line (VCDL) composed of $M$ identical, cascaded tunable delay stages is embedded in a Delay-Locked Loop (DLL) for clock phase alignment in an Electronic Design Automation (EDA) flow. Each stage has an instantaneous propagation delay $\\tau(v_{c})$ that is strictly monotone with respect to a global control variable $v_{c}$, and is bounded between a minimum and maximum achievable delay, $\\tau_{\\min}$ and $\\tau_{\\max}$, at the control range endpoints. Assume all stages are identically controlled by the same $v_{c}$, and neglect noise and mismatch so that all stages share the same instantaneous delay at a given $v_{c}$. The DLL operates in the fundamental (one-period) lock mode, meaning the loop can lock only if the total VCDL delay equals the input reference period.\n\nFrom first principles, determine the total tuning range of the cascaded VCDL as a function of $M$, $\\tau_{\\min}$, and $\\tau_{\\max}$, and then determine the minimum integer $M$ that guarantees the DLL can lock to a given reference period $T_{\\text{ref}}$. Use the following numerically specified stage bounds and reference period:\n- $\\tau_{\\min} = 20\\,\\text{ps}$,\n- $\\tau_{\\max} = 60\\,\\text{ps}$,\n- $T_{\\text{ref}} = 1\\,\\text{ns}$.\n\nExpress the total tuning range as the ordered pair of expressions $(\\tau_{\\text{tot,min}}(M), \\tau_{\\text{tot,max}}(M))$ in terms of $M$, $\\tau_{\\min}$, and $\\tau_{\\max}$, and the minimum stage count as the smallest positive integer $M_{\\min}$ that ensures the existence of a control setting satisfying the one-period lock condition. Present your final answer as a single row matrix $\\big[\\tau_{\\text{tot,min}}(M),\\ \\tau_{\\text{tot,max}}(M),\\ M_{\\min}\\big]$. The stage-count answer $M_{\\min}$ must be an exact integer. Do not include units in your final boxed answer. If you find any intermediate numerical values, do not round; no rounding is required in this problem.",
            "solution": "The problem has been validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard problem in the analysis of delay-locked loops (DLLs) and can be solved from first principles.\n\nThe Voltage-Controlled Delay Line (VCDL) consists of $M$ identical delay stages connected in series. The propagation delay of each individual stage, $\\tau(v_c)$, is a function of a global control variable $v_c$. Since all stages are identical and controlled by the same $v_c$, they all exhibit the same delay $\\tau(v_c)$ at any given instant.\n\nThe total propagation delay of the VCDL, $\\tau_{\\text{tot}}$, is the sum of the delays of the $M$ cascaded stages.\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{tot}}(v_c) = \\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\tau_i(v_c) = M \\cdot \\tau(v_c) $$\nThe problem states that the delay of each stage is bounded by a minimum value, $\\tau_{\\min}$, and a maximum value, $\\tau_{\\max}$.\n$$ \\tau_{\\min} \\le \\tau(v_c) \\le \\tau_{\\max} $$\nConsequently, the total delay of the VCDL is also bounded. The minimum total delay, $\\tau_{\\text{tot,min}}$, occurs when each stage is at its minimum delay $\\tau_{\\min}$.\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{tot,min}}(M) = M \\tau_{\\min} $$\nThe maximum total delay, $\\tau_{\\text{tot,max}}$, occurs when each stage is at its maximum delay $\\tau_{\\max}$.\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{tot,max}}(M) = M \\tau_{\\max} $$\nThe problem states that the stage delay $\\tau(v_c)$ is a strictly monotone function of $v_c$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, as $v_c$ is varied across its control range, the stage delay $\\tau(v_c)$ takes on every value in the continuous interval $[\\tau_{\\min}, \\tau_{\\max}]$. Correspondingly, the total VCDL delay $\\tau_{\\text{tot}}(v_c)$ continuously covers the entire range $[\\tau_{\\text{tot,min}}(M), \\tau_{\\text{tot,max}}(M)]$.\nThe total tuning range of the VCDL is this interval, which can be represented by the ordered pair of its endpoints $(\\tau_{\\text{tot,min}}(M), \\tau_{\\text{tot,max}}(M))$. As functions of $M$, $\\tau_{\\min}$, and $\\tau_{\\max}$, these are $(M \\tau_{\\min}, M \\tau_{\\max})$.\n\nNext, we determine the minimum number of stages, $M_{\\min}$, required for the DLL to achieve lock. The problem specifies a \"fundamental (one-period) lock mode,\" where the lock condition is that the total delay of the VCDL must equal the period of the input reference clock, $T_{\\text{ref}}$.\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{tot}}(v_c) = T_{\\text{ref}} $$\nFor the DLL to be able to satisfy this condition, the value $T_{\\text{ref}}$ must lie within the achievable tuning range of the VCDL. This gives the following necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a lock point:\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{tot,min}}(M) \\le T_{\\text{ref}} \\le \\tau_{\\text{tot,max}}(M) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the total delay bounds, we get a pair of inequalities for $M$:\n$$ M \\tau_{\\min} \\le T_{\\text{ref}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad M \\tau_{\\max} \\ge T_{\\text{ref}} $$\nThese can be rearranged to bound $M$:\n$$ \\frac{T_{\\text{ref}}}{\\tau_{\\max}} \\le M \\le \\frac{T_{\\text{ref}}}{\\tau_{\\min}} $$\nThe problem asks for the minimum integer $M$ that guarantees lock is possible. This corresponds to the smallest integer $M$ that satisfies the above compound inequality. The most restrictive condition for finding the *minimum* $M$ is the lower bound:\n$$ M \\ge \\frac{T_{\\text{ref}}}{\\tau_{\\max}} $$\nSince $M$ must be an integer, the minimum value for $M$, which we denote as $M_{\\min}$, is the smallest integer greater than or equal to $\\frac{T_{\\text{ref}}}{\\tau_{\\max}}$. This is given by the ceiling function:\n$$ M_{\\min} = \\left\\lceil \\frac{T_{\\text{ref}}}{\\tau_{\\max}} \\right\\rceil $$\nWe must verify that this minimum $M$ also satisfies the second inequality, $M_{\\min} \\le \\frac{T_{\\text{ref}}}{\\tau_{\\min}}$. This is guaranteed if the interval $[\\frac{T_{\\text{ref}}}{\\tau_{\\max}}, \\frac{T_{\\text{ref}}}{\\tau_{\\min}}]$ contains at least one integer, which is generally true for practical DLL designs where $\\tau_{\\max}$ is significantly larger than $\\tau_{\\min}$.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$$ \\tau_{\\min} = 20\\,\\text{ps} $$\n$$ \\tau_{\\max} = 60\\,\\text{ps} $$\n$$ T_{\\text{ref}} = 1\\,\\text{ns} = 1000\\,\\text{ps} $$\nUsing these values, we calculate the bounds for $M$:\n$$ \\frac{1000\\,\\text{ps}}{60\\,\\text{ps}} \\le M \\le \\frac{1000\\,\\text{ps}}{20\\,\\text{ps}} $$\n$$ \\frac{50}{3} \\le M \\le 50 $$\n$$ 16.66\\overline{6} \\le M \\le 50 $$\nThe minimum integer $M$ must satisfy $M \\ge 16.66\\overline{6}$. The smallest integer that meets this condition is $17$.\n$$ M_{\\min} = \\lceil 16.66\\overline{6} \\rceil = 17 $$\nFor $M=17$, the VCDL tuning range is $[17 \\times 20\\,\\text{ps}, 17 \\times 60\\,\\text{ps}] = [340\\,\\text{ps}, 1020\\,\\text{ps}]$. Since $T_{\\text{ref}} = 1000\\,\\text{ps}$ is within this range, a lock is achievable. For $M=16$, the maximum delay would be $16 \\times 60\\,\\text{ps} = 960\\,\\text{ps}$, which is less than $T_{\\text{ref}}$, so lock would be impossible. Thus, $M_{\\min} = 17$ is correct.\n\nThe final answer requires a row matrix containing the symbolic expressions for the tuning range endpoints and the calculated numerical value for $M_{\\min}$.\nThe components are:\n1.  $\\tau_{\\text{tot,min}}(M) = M \\tau_{\\min}$\n2.  $\\tau_{\\text{tot,max}}(M) = M \\tau_{\\max}$\n3.  $M_{\\min} = 17$",

Modeling a DLL as a first-order LTI system for small-signal analysis is a standard and widely accepted practice in the field of analog and mixed-signal integrated circuit design. The concepts of bandwidth, step response, and phase error are fundamental to control systems and their application to phase/delay tracking loops.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed.

The provided data are sufficient and do not conflict. The values given for bandwidth and frequency are physically realistic for modern DLLs.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid** and well-posed. The solution process may proceed.\n\nThe relationship between the output phase, $\\phi_{out}(t)$, and the input phase, $\\phi_{in}(t)$, for a first-order LTI closed-loop system with unity DC gain and bandwidth $\\omega_b$ is described by the transfer function:\n$$ H(s) = \\frac{\\Phi_{out}(s)}{\\Phi_{in}(s)} = \\frac{\\omega_b}{s + \\omega_b} $$\nAs required, we start from the fundamental differential equation, which is derived by converting the transfer function back to the time domain:\n$$ s\\Phi_{out}(s) + \\omega_b \\Phi_{out}(s) = \\omega_b \\Phi_{in}(s) $$\n$$ \\frac{d\\phi_{out}(t)}{dt} + \\omega_b \\phi_{out}(t) = \\omega_b \\phi_{in}(t) $$\nThe input is a unit phase step, so $\\phi_{in}(t)=1$ for $t \\ge 0$. The differential equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{d\\phi_{out}(t)}{dt} + \\omega_b \\phi_{out}(t) = \\omega_b $$\nThis is a first-order linear non-homogeneous ordinary differential equation. The solution is the sum of a homogeneous solution, $\\phi_h(t)$, and a particular solution, $\\phi_p(t)$. The homogeneous equation is $\\frac{d\\phi_h(t)}{dt} + \\omega_b \\phi_h(t) = 0$, which has the solution $\\phi_h(t) = A \\exp(-\\omega_b t)$, where $A$ is a constant. For a constant forcing term, we assume a particular solution of the form $\\phi_p(t) = C$. Substituting this into the full ODE yields $0 + \\omega_b C = \\omega_b$, so $C=1$.\n\nThe general solution for the output phase is:\n$$ \\phi_{out}(t) = \\phi_h(t) + \\phi_p(t) = A \\exp(-\\omega_b t) + 1 $$\nWe assume the system is initially at rest, meaning $\\phi_{out}(0) = 0$. Applying this initial condition at $t=0$:\n$$ \\phi_{out}(0) = A \\exp(0) + 1 = A + 1 = 0 \\implies A = -1 $$\nThe step response of the output phase is therefore:\n$$ \\phi_{out}(t) = 1 - \\exp(-\\omega_b t) \\quad \\text{for } t \\ge 0 $$\nThe phase error, $\\phi_e(t)$, is defined as the difference between the input and output phase. For a unit step input, the initial error is $1$, so $\\phi_e(t)$ can be directly interpreted as the normalized phase error.\n$$ \\phi_e(t) = \\phi_{in}(t) - \\phi_{out}(t) = 1 - \\left(1 - \\exp(-\\omega_b t)\\right) = \\exp(-\\omega_b t) $$\nThe lock condition requires the magnitude of this error to be less than $0.01$. Since $\\phi_e(t)$ is always positive, we need to find the minimum time $t_{\\mathrm{lock}}$ such that $\\phi_e(t) \\le 0.01$ for all $t \\ge t_{\\mathrm{lock}}$. We solve the equality:\n$$ \\exp(-\\omega_b t_{\\mathrm{lock}}) = 0.01 $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n$$ -\\omega_b t_{\\mathrm{lock}} = \\ln(0.01) = \\ln(10^{-2}) = -2\\ln(10) $$\nSolving for $t_{\\mathrm{lock}}$:\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{lock}} = \\frac{-2\\ln(10)}{-\\omega_b} = \\frac{2\\ln(10)}{\\omega_b} = \\frac{\\ln(100)}{\\omega_b} $$\nThe problem gives the closed-loop bandwidth as $\\omega_b = 2\\pi \\cdot 2\\,\\text{MHz} = 4\\pi \\times 10^6$ radians per second.

The reference frequency is $f_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 500\\,\\text{MHz}$. The reference period $T_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ is:\n$$ T_{\\mathrm{ref}} = \\frac{1}{f_{\\mathrm{ref}}} = \\frac{1}{500 \\times 10^6 \\text{ Hz}} = 2 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ s} = 2 \\text{ ns} $$\nThe total time after $N$ cycles, $N \\cdot T_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, must be greater than or equal to the required lock time $t_{\\mathrm{lock}}$.\n$$ N \\cdot T_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\ge t_{\\mathrm{lock}} \\implies N \\ge \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{lock}}}{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}} $$\nUsing the unrounded value of $t_{\\mathrm{lock}}$ for accuracy:\n$$ N \\ge \\frac{3.66479 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ s}}{2 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ s}} \\ge 183.2395 $$\nSince the number of cycles $N$ must be an integer, we take the ceiling of this value:\n$$ N = \\lceil 183.2395 \\rceil = 184 $$\nThe minimum integer number of cycles required to guarantee lock is $184$.",
