            "problem": "Consider a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) linearized about lock and modeled by a canonical second-order Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) closed-loop transfer from input phase to output phase. The closed-loop is characterized by a natural frequency $\\,\\omega_{n}\\,$ and damping ratio $\\,\\zeta\\,$ with $\\,0<\\zeta<1\\,$. At time $\\,t=0\\,$, the input phase undergoes a small step of unit amplitude (one radian).

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a conservative, closed-form expression for the lock time $t_{L}(\\epsilon)$ of a canonical second-order Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) subjected to a unit phase step input. The derivation must be based on the envelope of the natural response.\n\nThe closed-loop transfer function $H(s)$ from the input phase $\\Phi_{\\text{in}}(s)$ to the output phase $\\Phi_{\\text{out}}(s)$ for a canonical second-order system is given by:\n$$ H(s) = \\frac{\\Phi_{\\text{out}}(s)}{\\Phi_{\\text{in}}(s)} = \\frac{\\omega_{n}^2}{s^2 + 2\\zeta\\omega_{n}s + \\omega_{n}^2} $$\nHere, $\\omega_{n}$ is the natural frequency and $\\zeta$ is the damping ratio. The problem specifies an underdamped system, for which $0 < \\zeta < 1$.\n\nThe input is a unit phase step applied at time $t=0$, which in the Laplace domain is represented as:\n$$ \\Phi_{\\text{in}}(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\} = \\frac{1}{s} $$\nwhere $u(t)$ is the unit step function.\n\nThe output phase in the Laplace domain is therefore:\n$$ \\Phi_{\\text{out}}(s) = H(s)\\Phi_{\\text{in}}(s) = \\frac{\\omega_{n}^2}{s(s^2 + 2\\zeta\\omega_{n}s + \\omega_{n}^2)} $$\n\nTo find the time-domain response $\\phi_{\\text{out}}(t)$, we compute the inverse Laplace transform of $\\Phi_{\\text{out}}(s)$. For an underdamped system ($0 < \\zeta < 1$), the standard result for the unit step response is:\n$$ \\phi_{\\text{out}}(t) = 1 - \\exp(-\\zeta\\omega_{n}t) \\left( \\cos(\\omega_{d}t) + \\frac{\\zeta}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}} \\sin(\\omega_{d}t) \\right) $$\nwhere $\\omega_{d} = \\omega_{n}\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}$ is the damped natural frequency. The final value of the output phase is $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\phi_{\\text{out}}(t) = 1$ radian, as expected for a system with unity DC gain responding to a unit step.\n\nThe problem defines the lock time $t_{L}(\\epsilon)$ based on the deviation of the output phase from its final value. Let this deviation be $\\Delta\\phi(t) = \\phi_{\\text{out}}(t) - 1$.\n$$ \\Delta\\phi(t) = - \\exp(-\\zeta\\omega_{n}t) \\left( \\cos(\\omega_{d}t) + \\frac{\\zeta}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}} \\sin(\\omega_{d}t) \\right) $$\n\nTo determine the envelope of this deviation, we express the sinusoidal terms in a single phase-shifted sinusoidal form, $A\\sin(\\theta + \\psi)$. The amplitude $A$ of the expression in the parenthesis is:\n$$ A = \\sqrt{1^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\zeta}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{\\zeta^2}{1-\\zeta^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\zeta^2+\\zeta^2}{1-\\zeta^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}} $$\nThus, the deviation can be written as:\n$$ \\Delta\\phi(t) = - \\frac{\\exp(-\\zeta\\omega_{n}t)}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}} \\sin(\\omega_{d}t + \\psi) $$\nwhere $\\psi = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}}{\\zeta}\\right)$. The magnitude of the deviation is:\n$$ |\\phi_{\\text{out}}(t) - 1| = \\left| - \\frac{\\exp(-\\zeta\\omega_{n}t)}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}} \\sin(\\omega_{d}t + \\psi) \\right| = \\frac{\\exp(-\\zeta\\omega_{n}t)}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}} |\\sin(\\omega_{d}t + \\psi)| $$\n\nThe problem asks for a conservative estimate of the lock time by using the envelope of the natural response. The envelope of $|\\phi_{\\text{out}}(t) - 1|$ is found by replacing the oscillating term $|\\sin(\\omega_{d}t + \\psi)|$ with its maximum possible value, which is $1$. Let this envelope be $E(t)$.\n$$ E(t) = \\frac{\\exp(-\\zeta\\omega_{n}t)}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}} $$\nThe lock time condition is $|\\phi_{\\text{out}}(t) - 1| \\leq \\epsilon$ for all $t \\geq t_{L}(\\epsilon)$. To obtain a conservative value for $t_{L}(\\epsilon)$, we enforce the stricter condition that the envelope $E(t)$ must be less than or equal to $\\epsilon$. The lock time $t_{L}(\\epsilon)$ is the time at which the envelope first enters and subsequently remains within this bound. This occurs when the envelope value equals $\\epsilon$.\n$$ E(t_{L}(\\epsilon)) = \\frac{\\exp(-\\zeta\\omega_{n}t_{L}(\\epsilon))}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}} = \\epsilon $$\n\nWe now solve this equation for $t_{L}(\\epsilon)$:\n$$ \\exp(-\\zeta\\omega_{n}t_{L}(\\epsilon)) = \\epsilon\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2} $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n$$ -\\zeta\\omega_{n}t_{L}(\\epsilon) = \\ln\\left(\\epsilon\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}\\right) $$\nSolving for $t_{L}(\\epsilon)$:\n$$ t_{L}(\\epsilon) = -\\frac{1}{\\zeta\\omega_{n}} \\ln\\left(\\epsilon\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}\\right) $$\nUsing the property of logarithms $\\ln(x^{-1}) = -\\ln(x)$, this expression can be written as:\n$$ t_{L}(\\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{\\zeta\\omega_{n}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}}\\right) $$\nThis is the desired closed-form expression for the lock time.\n\nFinally, we determine the condition on $\\epsilon$ for $t_{L}(\\epsilon)$ to be strictly positive. Given that $\\omega_{n} > 0$ and $0 < \\zeta < 1$, the pre-factor $\\frac{1}{\\zeta\\omega_{n}}$ is always positive. Therefore, for $t_{L}(\\epsilon) > 0$, the argument of the logarithm must be greater than $1$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\epsilon\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}} > 1 $$\n$$ 1 > \\epsilon\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2} $$\n$$ \\epsilon < \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}} $$\nThe problem specifies that $0 < \\epsilon < 1$. For the given range of $\\zeta$, $0 < \\zeta < 1$, the term $\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}$ is in the range $(0, 1)$. Consequently, $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}}$ is always greater than $1$. Since $\\epsilon < 1$, the condition $\\epsilon < \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}}$ is always satisfied under the problem's constraints. The physical interpretation is that the requested error bound $\\epsilon$ must be smaller than the initial value of the response envelope at $t=0$, which is $E(0) = (\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2})^{-1}$, for the lock time to be a positive duration.",

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution proceeds in two main parts as requested by the problem statement. First, we formulate the total output phase noise PSD, $S_{\\phi,\\mathrm{out}}(f)$. Second, we integrate this PSD to find the total output phase variance, from which we derive the RMS time jitter.\n\n**1. Total Output Phase Noise PSD**\n\nFor a Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system, the output power spectral density, $S_{\\text{out}}(f)$, is related to the input power spectral density, $S_{\\text{in}}(f)$, by the magnitude-squared of the system's frequency response, $|H(f)|^2$, as follows:\n$$S_{\\text{out}}(f) = S_{\\text{in}}(f) \\left|H(f)\\right|^2$$\nThe problem states that the noise sources (reference and VCO) are uncorrelated. Therefore, their contributions to the total output noise power add linearly. The total output phase noise PSD, $S_{\\phi,\\mathrm{out}}(f)$, is the sum of the reference noise contribution and the VCO noise contribution.\n\nThe contribution from the reference phase noise is:\n$$S_{\\phi,\\mathrm{out,ref}}(f) = S_{\\phi,\\mathrm{ref}}(f) \\left|H_{\\mathrm{ref}}(f)\\right|^2$$\nThe contribution from the VCO phase noise is:\n$$S_{\\phi,\\mathrm{out,vco}}(f) = S_{\\phi,\\mathrm{vco}}(f) \\left|H_{\\mathrm{vco}}(f)\\right|^2$$\nThe total output phase noise PSD is their sum:\n$$S_{\\phi,\\mathrm{out}}(f) = S_{\\phi,\\mathrm{out,ref}}(f) + S_{\\phi,\\mathrm{out,vco}}(f)$$\nOver the specified frequency band $f \\in [f_{1}, f_{2}]$, the input PSDs are constant floors, $S_{\\phi,\\mathrm{ref}}(f) = S_{r0}$ and $S_{\\phi,\\mathrm{vco}}(f) = S_{v0}$. Substituting the given expressions:\n$$S_{\\phi,\\mathrm{out}}(f) = S_{r0} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{f}{f_{c}}\\right)^{2}}\\right) + S_{v0} \\left(\\dfrac{\\left(\\frac{f}{f_{c}}\\right)^{2}}{1 + \\left(\\frac{f}{f_{c}}\\right)^{2}}\\right)$$\nThis expression can be combined over a common denominator:\n$$S_{\\phi,\\mathrm{out}}(f) = \\dfrac{S_{r0} + S_{v0}\\left(\\frac{f}{f_{c}}\\right)^{2}}{1 + \\left(\\frac{f}{f_{c}}\\right)^{2}}$$\nThis is the total output phase noise PSD for $f \\in [f_{1}, f_{2}]$.\n\n**2. Integration for Phase Variance and Conversion to Time Jitter**\n\nThe total integrated phase variance, $\\sigma_{\\phi}^2$, is the integral of the single-sided PSD $S_{\\phi,\\mathrm{out}}(f)$ over the frequency interval of interest, $[f_{1}, f_{2}]$.\n$$\\sigma_{\\phi}^2 = \\int_{f_{1}}^{f_{2}} S_{\\phi,\\mathrm{out}}(f) \\, df$$\nTo simplify the integration, the integrand is rearranged by algebraic manipulation:\n$$S_{\\phi,\\mathrm{out}}(f) = \\dfrac{S_{r0} + S_{v0}\\left(\\frac{f}{f_{c}}\\right)^{2}}{1 + \\left(\\frac{f}{f_{c}}\\right)^{2}} = \\dfrac{S_{r0} - S_{v0} + S_{v0} + S_{v0}\\left(\\frac{f}{f_{c}}\\right)^{2}}{1 + \\left(\\frac{f}{f_{c}}\\right)^{2}}$$\n$$S_{\\phi,\\mathrm{out}}(f) = \\dfrac{S_{r0} - S_{v0}}{1 + \\left(\\frac{f}{f_{c}}\\right)^{2}} + \\dfrac{S_{v0}\\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{f}{f_{c}}\\right)^{2}\\right)}{1 + \\left(\\frac{f}{f_{c}}\\right)^{2}} = \\dfrac{S_{r0} - S_{v0}}{1 + \\left(\\frac{f}{f_{c}}\\right)^{2}} + S_{v0}$$\nThis form is more amenable to integration. The phase variance integral becomes:\n$$\\sigma_{\\phi}^2 = \\int_{f_{1}}^{f_{2}} \\left( \\dfrac{S_{r0} - S_{v0}}{1 + \\left(\\frac{f}{f_{c}}\\right)^{2}} + S_{v0} \\right) df$$\n$$\\sigma_{\\phi}^2 = (S_{r0} - S_{v0}) \\int_{f_{1}}^{f_{2}} \\dfrac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{f}{f_{c}}\\right)^{2}} df + S_{v0} \\int_{f_{1}}^{f_{2}} df$$\nThe second integral is trivial: $S_{v0}(f_{2} - f_{1})$. For the first integral, the antiderivative of $\\left(1 + (f/f_c)^2\\right)^{-1}$ with respect to $f$ is $f_{c}\\arctan(f/f_{c})$.\n$$\\int_{f_{1}}^{f_{2}} \\dfrac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{f}{f_{c}}\\right)^{2}} df = \\left[ f_{c}\\arctan\\left(\\frac{f}{f_{c}}\\right) \\right]_{f_{1}}^{f_{2}} = f_{c} \\left( \\arctan\\left(\\frac{f_{2}}{f_{c}}\\right) - \\arctan\\left(\\frac{f_{1}}{f_{c}}\\right) \\right)$$\nCombining the results, the total phase variance is:\n$$\\sigma_{\\phi}^2 = (S_{r0} - S_{v0}) f_{c} \\left[ \\arctan\\left(\\frac{f_{2}}{f_{c}}\\right) - \\arctan\\left(\\frac{f_{1}}{f_{c}}\\right) \\right] + S_{v0}(f_{2} - f_{1})$$\nThe Root Mean Square (RMS) phase jitter is $\\sigma_{\\phi} = \\sqrt{\\sigma_{\\phi}^2}$. The kinematic relationship between a small phase fluctuation $\\Delta\\phi$ (in radians) and the corresponding time fluctuation $\\Delta t$ for a sinusoidal carrier with frequency $f_0$ is $\\Delta\\phi = 2\\pi f_0 \\Delta t$. Therefore, the RMS time jitter, $\\sigma_t$, is:\n$$\\sigma_{t} = \\dfrac{\\sigma_{\\phi}}{2\\pi f_{0}} = \\dfrac{1}{2\\pi f_{0}} \\sqrt{(S_{r0} - S_{v0}) f_{c} \\left[ \\arctan\\left(\\frac{f_{2}}{f_{c}}\\right) - \\arctan\\left(\\frac{f_{1}}{f_{c}}\\right) \\right] + S_{v0}(f_{2} - f_{1})}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $f_{0} = 2.5 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$\n- $f_{c} = 100 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{Hz} = 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$\n- $f_{1} = 1 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$\n- $f_{2} = 100 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{Hz} = 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$\n- $S_{r0} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{rad}^{2}/\\mathrm{Hz}$\n- $S_{v0} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{rad}^{2}/\\mathrm{Hz}$\n\nFirst, calculate the arguments for the arctan functions:\n- $\\frac{f_{2}}{f_{c}} = \\frac{10^{8}}{10^{5}} = 1000$\n- $\\frac{f_{1}}{f_{c}} = \\frac{10^{3}}{10^{5}} = 0.01$\n\nNext, calculate the terms inside the square root:\n- $S_{r0} - S_{v0} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-10} - 1.0 \\times 10^{-12} = 100 \\times 10^{-12} - 1 \\times 10^{-12} = 99 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{rad}^{2}/\\mathrm{Hz}$\n- $f_{2} - f_{1} = 10^{8} - 10^{3} = 99,999,000\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$\n\nThe first term for $\\sigma_{\\phi}^2$:\n$$T_{1} = (99 \\times 10^{-12}) \\times 10^{5} \\times [\\arctan(1000) - \\arctan(0.01)]$$\n$$T_{1} \\approx (9.9 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times (1.5707963 - 0.00999967) = (9.9 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times (1.56079663) \\approx 1.5451887 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{rad}^{2}$$\nThe second term for $\\sigma_{\\phi}^2$:\n$$T_{2} = (1.0 \\times 10^{-12}) \\times (99,999,000) = 9.9999 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{rad}^{2}$$\nThe total phase variance is:\n$$\\sigma_{\\phi}^2 = T_{1} + T_{2} \\approx 1.5451887 \\times 10^{-5} + 9.9999 \\times 10^{-5} = 11.5450887 \\times 10^{-5} \\approx 1.15451 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{rad}^{2}$$\nThe RMS phase jitter is:\n$$\\sigma_{\\phi} = \\sqrt{1.15451 \\times 10^{-4}} \\approx 0.0107448\\,\\mathrm{rad}$$\nFinally, we calculate the RMS time jitter $\\sigma_t$:\n$$\\sigma_{t} = \\dfrac{\\sigma_{\\phi}}{2\\pi f_{0}} \\approx \\dfrac{0.0107448}{2\\pi \\times (2.5 \\times 10^{9})} = \\dfrac{0.0107448}{5\\pi \\times 10^{9}} \\approx \\dfrac{0.0107448}{1.570796 \\times 10^{10}} \\approx 6.83909 \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nThe problem asks for the result in femtoseconds ($1\\,\\mathrm{fs} = 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{s}$).\n$$\\sigma_{t} \\approx 6.83909 \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 683.909 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 683.909\\,\\mathrm{fs}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $684\\,\\mathrm{fs}$.",

The problem states the current is a \"rectangular pulse train of amplitude $I_{\\mathrm{CP}}$ and width $\\tau$\" and also that it has \"zero average over a period\". A single, positive rectangular pulse has a non-zero average. The phrase \"equal and opposite CP pulses\" suggests the underlying physical mechanism. The most direct interpretation consistent with standard analysis is that the problem asks to consider the AC component of a periodic train of rectangular pulses of amplitude $I_{\\mathrm{CP}}$ and width $\\tau$. The DC component, which would be $I_{\\mathrm{CP}}\\tau/T_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, is assumed to be cancelled by the PLL's feedback action to maintain lock, and thus does not contribute to the AC ripple (spurs). With this standard interpretation, the problem is not contradictory.\n    - **Unrealistic or Infeasible**: The given values are typical for modern integrated PLLs.\n    - **Ill-Posed or Poorly Structured**: No, under the standard interpretation, it's well-posed.\n    - **Trivial/Tautological**: No, the problem requires a multi-step derivation from first principles.\n    - **Outside Verifiability**: The model and its consequences are experimentally verifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A detailed solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\nThe solution proceeds by following the steps outlined in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we model the charge pump current $i_{\\mathrm{cp}}(t)$ entering the loop filter. The problem states this is a periodic rectangular pulse train with period $T_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, amplitude $I_{\\mathrm{CP}}$, and width $\\tau$. In a locked PLL, any DC component of this disturbance current is cancelled by the feedback loop. The periodic AC components, however, remain and cause ripples on the VCO control voltage. The spur at the reference frequency is caused by the fundamental harmonic of this current waveform. We can represent the AC component of the current by its Fourier series. The waveform can be modeled as a series of pulses of height $I_{\\mathrm{CP}}$ and duration $\\tau$ occurring once every $T_{\\mathrm{ref}}$.\n\nThe complex Fourier series coefficient $c_n$ for a periodic function $f(t)$ with period $T$ is given by $c_n = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{T} f(t) e^{-j n \\omega_0 t} dt$, where $\\omega_0 = 2\\pi/T$. For the current waveform $i_{\\mathrm{cp}}(t)$, with $T=T_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ and $\\omega_0=\\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, the first harmonic coefficient ($n=1$) is:\n$$c_1 = \\frac{1}{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\int_{0}^{\\tau} I_{\\mathrm{CP}} e^{-j \\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}} t} dt$$\n$$c_1 = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{CP}}}{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\left[ \\frac{e^{-j \\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}} t}}{-j \\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\right]_{0}^{\\tau} = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{CP}}}{-j \\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}} T_{\\mathrm{ref}}} (e^{-j \\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\tau} - 1)$$\nUsing $\\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}} T_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 2\\pi$:\n$$c_1 = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{CP}}}{-j 2\\pi} (e^{-j \\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\tau} - 1)$$\nThe magnitude of this coefficient is:\n$$|c_1| = \\left| \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{CP}}}{-j 2\\pi} \\right| \\left| e^{-j \\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\tau} - 1 \\right| = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{CP}}}{2\\pi} \\left| e^{-j \\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\tau/2} (e^{-j \\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\tau/2} - e^{j \\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\tau/2}) \\right|$$\n$$|c_1| = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{CP}}}{2\\pi} \\left| -2j \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\tau}{2}\\right) \\right| = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{CP}}}{\\pi} \\left| \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\tau}{2}\\right) \\right|$$\nThe first harmonic of the current is $i_1(t) = c_1 e^{j\\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}}t} + c_{-1}e^{-j\\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}}t}$. Since $i_{\\mathrm{cp}}(t)$ is real, $c_{-1} = c_1^*$. This combination represents a real sinusoid with a peak amplitude of $I_{1,\\text{peak}} = 2|c_1|$.\n$$I_{1,\\text{peak}} = \\frac{2 I_{\\mathrm{CP}}}{\\pi} \\left| \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\tau}{2}\\right) \\right|$$\nThis current harmonic at $\\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ flows into the loop filter, which has an impedance $Z(j\\omega)$. At the frequency $\\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, this current produces a voltage ripple on the VCO control line, $v_{\\mathrm{ctrl},1}(t)$. The peak amplitude of this voltage ripple, $V_{1,\\text{peak}}$, is given by Ohm's law in the frequency domain:\n$$V_{1,\\text{peak}} = I_{1,\\text{peak}} |Z(j \\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}})| = \\frac{2 I_{\\mathrm{CP}}}{\\pi} |Z(j \\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}})| \\left| \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\tau}{2}\\right) \\right|$$\nThis voltage ripple modulates the VCO's frequency. The instantaneous frequency deviation from the carrier, $\\Delta\\omega(t)$, is:\n$$\\Delta\\omega(t) = K_{\\mathrm{VCO}} v_{\\mathrm{ctrl},1}(t)$$\nThe peak frequency deviation is $\\Delta\\omega_{\\text{peak}} = K_{\\mathrm{VCO}} V_{1,\\text{peak}}$. The output phase of the VCO is the integral of its instantaneous frequency. The phase deviation $\\Delta\\theta(t)$ is the integral of the frequency deviation $\\Delta\\omega(t)$. For a sinusoidal frequency deviation, the peak phase deviation, known as the phase modulation index $\\beta$, is:\n$$\\beta = \\frac{\\Delta\\omega_{\\text{peak}}}{\\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}}} = \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{VCO}} V_{1,\\text{peak}}}{\\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $V_{1,\\text{peak}}$:\n$$\\beta = \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{VCO}}}{\\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\frac{2 I_{\\mathrm{CP}}}{\\pi} |Z(j \\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}})| \\left| \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\tau}{2}\\right) \\right|$$\nA phase-modulated signal $V_{\\mathrm{out}}(t) = A\\cos(\\omega_0 t + \\beta \\sin(\\omega_m t))$ can be expanded using Bessel functions. For a small modulation index ($\\beta \\ll 1$), we can use the approximation $J_0(\\beta) \\approx 1$, $J_1(\\beta) \\approx \\beta/2$, and $J_n(\\beta) \\approx 0$ for $n>1$. The output signal is approximately:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{out}}(t) \\approx A \\cos(\\omega_0 t) + A\\frac{\\beta}{2}\\cos((\\omega_0+\\omega_m)t) - A\\frac{\\beta}{2}\\cos((\\omega_0-\\omega_m)t)$$\nThe amplitude of the carrier is $A$, and the amplitude of the first-order sidebands at $\\omega_0 \\pm \\omega_m$ is $A\\beta/2$. Here, the carrier is the PLL output frequency and the modulating signal is the reference, so $\\omega_m = \\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}}$.\nThe power is proportional to amplitude squared. The ratio of the power in a single sideband to the power in the carrier is $(\\frac{A\\beta/2}{A})^2 = (\\frac{\\beta}{2})^2$.\nIn decibels relative to the carrier ($\\mathrm{dBc}$), the magnitude of the reference spur is:\n$$S = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{2}\\right)^2\\right) = 20 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{2}\\right)$$\nNow we substitute the given values:\n- $I_{\\mathrm{CP}} = 100 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{A}$\n- $T_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 10 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n- $\\tau = 200 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n- $|Z(j \\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}})| = 100\\,\\Omega$\n- $K_{\\mathrm{VCO}} = 2\\pi \\times 300 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{rad/s/V}$\n\nFirst, calculate $\\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ and the argument of the sine function:\n$$\\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{10 \\times 10^{-9}} = 2\\pi \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$$\n$$\\frac{\\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\tau}{2} = \\frac{(2\\pi \\times 10^8) (200 \\times 10^{-12})}{2} = 2\\pi \\times 10^{-2} = 0.02\\pi\\,\\mathrm{rad}$$\nSince $0.02\\pi \\ll 1$, we can use the approximation $\\sin(x) \\approx x$.\n$$\\left| \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\tau}{2}\\right) \\right| \\approx \\frac{\\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\tau}{2} = 0.02\\pi$$\nNow, we calculate the modulation index $\\beta$:\n$$\\beta \\approx \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{VCO}}}{\\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\frac{2 I_{\\mathrm{CP}}}{\\pi} |Z(j \\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}})| \\left(\\frac{\\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\tau}{2}\\right) = \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{VCO}} I_{\\mathrm{CP}} |Z(j \\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}})| \\tau}{\\pi}$$\n$$\\beta \\approx \\frac{(2\\pi \\times 300 \\times 10^6) (100 \\times 10^{-6}) (100) (200 \\times 10^{-12})}{\\pi}$$\n$$\\beta \\approx 2 \\times (300 \\times 10^6) \\times (10^{-4}) \\times (10^2) \\times (2 \\times 10^{-10}) = 1200 \\times 10^{6-4+2-10} = 1200 \\times 10^{-6} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-3}$$\nThe value is small, confirming the validity of the small-index approximation.\nFinally, we compute the spur magnitude in $\\mathrm{dBc}$:\n$$S = 20 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{2}\\right) \\approx 20 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{1.2 \\times 10^{-3}}{2}\\right) = 20 \\log_{10}(6 \\times 10^{-4})$$\n$$S \\approx 20 (\\log_{10}(6) - 4) \\approx 20 (0.77815 - 4) = 20(-3.22185) \\approx -64.437\\,\\mathrm{dBc}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the result is $-64.4\\,\\mathrm{dBc}$.\n\nLet's do the calculation without the $\\sin(x)\\approx x$ approximation for higher precision before final rounding.\n$\\beta = \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{VCO}} I_{\\mathrm{CP}} |Z(j \\omega_{\\mathrm{ref}})| T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{\\pi^2} \\sin(\\frac{\\pi\\tau}{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}})$\n$\\frac{\\pi\\tau}{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}} = \\frac{\\pi (200 \\times 10^{-12})}{10 \\times 10^{-9}} = 0.02\\pi$\n$\\beta = \\frac{(2\\pi \\times 300 \\times 10^6)(100 \\times 10^{-6})(100)(10 \\times 10^{-9})}{\\pi^2}\\sin(0.02\\pi)$\n$\\beta = \\frac{2\\pi \\times 3 \\times 10^8 \\times 10^{-4} \\times 10^2 \\times 10^{-8}}{\\pi^2}\\sin(0.02\\pi) = \\frac{0.06}{\\pi}\\sin(0.02\\pi)$\n$\\beta = \\frac{0.06}{\\pi}\\sin(0.0628318...) = \\frac{0.06}{\\pi}(0.0627905...) = 0.0011991...$\n$S = 20 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{0.0011991}{2}\\right) = 20 \\log_{10}(0.00059955) = -64.443\\,\\mathrm{dBc}$\nRounding to three significant figures yields $-64.4\\,\\mathrm{dBc}$.
