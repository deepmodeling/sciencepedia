            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the minimum transconductance $g_{m,\\min}$ and the angular oscillation frequency $\\omega_0$ for a parallel $RLC$ tank oscillator. The derivation must start from Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL).\n\nThe oscillator circuit consists of a capacitor with capacitance $C$, an inductor with inductance $L$, a resistor with resistance $R_p$, and an active transconductance element with transconductance $g_m$, all connected in parallel. Let $v(t)$ be the voltage across this parallel network. According to KCL, the algebraic sum of currents leaving any node must be zero. For the single node of the parallel tank, we have:\n$$\ni_C(t) + i_L(t) + i_R(t) + i_{g_m}(t) = 0\n$$\nwhere $i_C(t)$, $i_L(t)$, $i_R(t)$, and $i_{g_m}(t)$ are the currents through the capacitor, inductor, resistor, and active device, respectively.\n\nTo analyze the conditions for sustained oscillation, we transform the circuit into the frequency domain. We use complex frequency $s = \\sigma + j\\omega$. In the frequency domain, the relationship between voltage $V(s)$ and current $I(s)$ for any component is given by its admittance $Y(s)$ as $I(s) = Y(s)V(s)$. The KCL equation becomes:\n$$\nI_C(s) + I_L(s) + I_R(s) + I_{g_m}(s) = 0\n$$\nThe admittances for the passive LTI components are:\n- Capacitor: $Y_C(s) = sC$\n- Inductor: $Y_L(s) = \\frac{1}{sL}$\n- Resistor: $Y_R(s) = \\frac{1}{R_p}$\n\nThe active device is defined by the relationship $i_{g_m}(t) = -g_m v(t)$. In the frequency domain, this is $I_{g_m}(s) = -g_m V(s)$. This corresponds to an admittance $Y_{g_m}(s) = -g_m$. The negative sign signifies that this element supplies power to the circuit, compensating for the energy dissipated by the resistor.\n\nSubstituting the admittance expressions into the KCL equation:\n$$\nsC V(s) + \\frac{1}{sL} V(s) + \\frac{1}{R_p} V(s) - g_m V(s) = 0\n$$\nFactoring out the common voltage term $V(s)$:\n$$\n\\left( sC + \\frac{1}{sL} + \\frac{1}{R_p} - g_m \\right) V(s) = 0\n$$\nFor a non-trivial solution to exist (i.e., for an oscillation $V(s) \\neq 0$ to occur), the total admittance of the parallel network, $Y_{\\text{total}}(s)$, must be zero:\n$$\nY_{\\text{total}}(s) = sC + \\frac{1}{sL} + \\frac{1}{R_p} - g_m = 0\n$$\nThe problem specifies that a sustained, steady-state oscillation corresponds to a non-trivial homogeneous solution at a purely imaginary complex frequency. This means the system must have poles on the $j\\omega$-axis of the complex plane.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the Impulse Sensitivity Function (ISF), denoted as $\\Gamma(\\theta)$, for a symmetric LC tank oscillator. The derivation will be based on analyzing the effect of an infinitesimal current impulse on the state of the oscillator.\n\nThe state of the unperturbed oscillator at any time $t$ is described by the tank voltage $v(t)$ and the inductor current $i_L(t)$. The phase is given by $\\theta = \\omega_{0} t$. The state variables are provided as:\n$$v(t) = \\hat{V}\\cos(\\theta)$$\n$$i_{L}(t) = \\frac{\\hat{V}}{\\omega_{0} L}\\sin(\\theta)$$\nwhere $\\hat{V}$ is the steady-state voltage amplitude and $\\omega_{0} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{LC}}$ is the angular frequency of oscillation.

For the ideal lossless tank, Kirchhoff's current law requires $i_L(t) + i_C(t) = 0$, which is satisfied by these expressions.\n\nAn infinitesimal current impulse is injected at time $t_{0}$, corresponding to the phase $\\theta_{0} = \\omega_{0} t_{0}$. This impulse injects a total charge $\\Delta q$. We analyze the state of the system immediately before ($t=t_{0}^{-}$) and after ($t=t_{0}^{+}$) the impulse.\n\nAt $t=t_{0}^{-}$, the state is given by the unperturbed trajectory:\n$$v(t_{0}^{-}) = \\hat{V}\\cos(\\theta_0)$$\n$$i_{L}(t_{0}^{-}) = \\frac{\\hat{V}}{\\omega_{0} L}\\sin(\\theta_0)$$\n\nThe problem states two key effects of the impulse:\n$1$. The inductor current is continuous, as the magnetic flux in an inductor cannot change instantaneously. Thus, $i_{L}(t_{0}^{+}) = i_{L}(t_{0}^{-})$.\n$2$. The injected charge $\\Delta q$ accumulates on the capacitor $C$ instantaneously, causing a voltage step $\\Delta v = \\Delta q/C$.

We can therefore use first-order Taylor series approximations for the trigonometric functions: $\\cos(\\theta_{0} + \\delta\\phi) \\approx \\cos(\\theta_0) - \\delta\\phi\\sin(\\theta_0)$ and $\\sin(\\theta_{0} + \\delta\\phi) \\approx \\sin(\\theta_0) + \\delta\\phi\\cos(\\theta_0)$.

Our result is $\\Gamma(\\theta) = \\sin(\\theta)$, so $|\\Gamma(\\theta)|$ is maximum when $|\\sin(\\theta)|=1$. This occurs at $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + k\\pi$ for any integer $k$. At these phases, the voltage is $v(t) = \\hat{V}\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + k\\pi) = 0$. These are precisely the zero-crossings of the voltage waveform.\n\nThe physical reason can be understood by considering the oscillator's state in a phase-plane diagram with axes representing voltage $v$ and a quantity proportional to inductor current, e.g., $\\sqrt{L/C} \\, i_L$. In this normalized state space, the unperturbed trajectory is a circle. A charge impulse $\\Delta q$ perturbs the voltage by $\\Delta v=\\Delta q/C$, but leaves the inductor current unchanged. This corresponds to a perturbation vector parallel to the voltage axis. The resulting phase shift is the projection of this perturbation vector onto the direction tangential to the circular trajectory. The magnitude of this tangential projection is maximized when the perturbation vector is perpendicular to the state vector itself. The state vector is along the voltage axis at the voltage peaks ($\\theta=0, \\pi$), resulting in a purely radial (amplitude) perturbation and zero phase shift. Conversely, the state vector is perpendicular to the voltage axis at the voltage zero-crossings ($\\theta=\\pi/2, 3\\pi/2$), making the perturbation vector purely tangential and maximally effective at changing the phase. These points of maximum phase sensitivity coincide with the points where the voltage slew rate, $|dv/dt| = |-\\hat{V}\\omega_0 \\sin(\\theta)| = \\hat{V}\\omega_0|\\sin(\\theta)|$, is maximum.",

Applying this to phase and angular frequency fluctuations:\n$$S_{\\delta\\phi}(f) = \\frac{S_{\\delta\\omega}(f)}{(2\\pi f)^2} = \\frac{(2\\pi)^2 S_{\\delta f}(f)}{(2\\pi f)^2} = \\frac{S_{\\delta f}(f)}{f^2}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $S_{\\delta f}(f)$:\n$$S_{\\delta\\phi}(f) = \\frac{(K_{\\text{vco}}\\,m)^2}{f^2} \\left( \\frac{K_{f}}{f} + \\frac{4 k_{B} T \\gamma}{g_{m}} \\right)$$\nThis can be broken down into two components, one arising from flicker noise and one from white noise:\nThe flicker noise contribution to the phase noise PSD is:\n$$S_{\\delta\\phi, 1/f}(f) = \\frac{(K_{\\text{vco}}\\,m)^2 K_f}{f^3}$$\nThis corresponds to the $1/f^3$ phase noise region.\nThe white noise contribution to the phase noise PSD is:\n$$S_{\\delta\\phi, w}(f) = \\frac{(K_{\\text{vco}}\\,m)^2}{f^2} \\left( \\frac{4 k_{B} T \\gamma}{g_{m}} \\right)$$\nThis corresponds to the $1/f^2$ phase noise region.\n\nThe corner frequency, $f_{c}$, is defined as the frequency at which these two contributions are equal.\n$$S_{\\delta\\phi, 1/f}(f_c) = S_{\\delta\\phi, w}(f_c)$$\n$$\\frac{(K_{\\text{vco}}\\,m)^2 K_f}{f_c^3} = \\frac{(K_{\\text{vco}}\\,m)^2}{f_c^2} \\left( \\frac{4 k_{B} T \\gamma}{g_{m}} \\right)$$\nThe term $(K_{\\text{vco}}\\,m)^2$ cancels from both sides, indicating that the corner frequency is an intrinsic characteristic of the noise sources and is independent of the VCO gain.\n$$\\frac{K_f}{f_c^3} = \\frac{1}{f_c^2} \\left( \\frac{4 k_{B} T \\gamma}{g_{m}} \\right)$$\nMultiplying both sides by $f_c^3$ (for $f_c \\neq 0$):\n$$K_f = f_c \\left( \\frac{4 k_{B} T \\gamma}{g_{m}} \\right)$$\nSolving for $f_c$, we obtain the analytical expression:\n$$f_c = \\frac{K_f g_m}{4 k_B T \\gamma}$$\nThis same result could have been obtained more directly by equating the PSDs of the underlying baseband noise sources at $f_c$: $S_{v,1/f}(f_c) = S_{v,w}$.\n\nNow, we evaluate $f_c$ numerically using the provided parameters:\n- $K_{f} = 1.20 \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{V}^{2}$\n- $g_{m} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{S}$\n- $\\gamma = \\frac{2}{3}$\n- $T = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- $k_{B} = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{K}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $f_c$:\n$$f_c = \\frac{(1.20 \\times 10^{-13}) \\times (1.00 \\times 10^{-2})}{4 \\times (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}) \\times (300) \\times \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)}$$\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n$$N = 1.20 \\times 10^{-13} \\times 1.00 \\times 10^{-2} = 1.20 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\mathrm{V^2 \\cdot S}$$\nNext, calculate the denominator:\n$$D = 4 \\times (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}) \\times 300 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 1.1045192 \\times 10^{-20} \\, \\mathrm{J}$$\nThus, the corner frequency is:\n$$f_c = \\frac{N}{D} = \\frac{1.20 \\times 10^{-15}}{1.1045192 \\times 10^{-20}} \\, \\mathrm{Hz}$$\n$$f_c \\approx 108644.5 \\, \\mathrm{Hz} = 1.086445 \\times 10^{5} \\, \\mathrm{Hz}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$f_c \\approx 1.086 \\times 10^5 \\, \\mathrm{Hz}$$",
