            "problem": "A pair of positive-edge-triggered synchronous flip-flops in a single clock domain are connected by a combinational data path. You may assume conventional static timing analysis semantics used in Electronic Design Automation (EDA), where the setup check compares the latest data arrival to the next active capture clock edge and the hold check compares the earliest data arrival to the same active capture clock edge. A positive useful skew is defined here as delaying the capture clock arrival relative to the launch clock arrival by an amount $S$ at the sink flip-flop.\n\nYou are given the following device and path parameters:\n- Launch flip-flop clock-to-$Q$ maximum: $t_{\\mathrm{cq}}^{\\max} = 60\\ \\mathrm{ps}$.\n- Launch flip-flop clock-to-$Q$ minimum: $t_{\\mathrm{cq}}^{\\min} = 30\\ \\mathrm{ps}$.\n- Capture flip-flop setup time: $t_{\\mathrm{setup}} = 40\\ \\mathrm{ps}$.\n- Capture flip-flop hold time: $t_{\\mathrm{hold}} = 20\\ \\mathrm{ps}$.\n- Combinational data path maximum delay: $d_{\\max} = 740\\ \\mathrm{ps}$.\n- Combinational data path minimum delay: $d_{\\min} = 150\\ \\mathrm{ps}$.\n- Clock period: $T = 1\\ \\mathrm{ns}$.\n- Clock uncertainty for setup analysis (including jitter and skew variability): $U_{\\mathrm{setup}} = 50\\ \\mathrm{ps}$.\n- Clock uncertainty for hold analysis (including jitter and skew variability): $U_{\\mathrm{hold}} = 25\\ \\mathrm{ps}$.\n\nAssume that clock uncertainty is applied as a reduction of available time in the setup check and as an additional requirement in the hold check. Also assume that the useful skew insertion $S$ itself is deterministic for sign-off (its variability is already subsumed in the given clock uncertainties).\n\nThe design team wants to introduce positive useful skew $S$ to improve the setup margin by $100\\ \\mathrm{ps}$ on this path while guaranteeing that no hold-time violation can occur. Starting from first principles of setup and hold timing definitions and without using any prepackaged shortcut formulas, derive the condition on $S$ imposed by the hold constraint in the presence of uncertainty and determine the largest value of $S$ that both achieves at least $100\\ \\mathrm{ps}$ setup margin improvement and avoids hold violation on this path.\n\nExpress your final answer as the maximum feasible $S$ in $\\mathrm{ps}$, and round your answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem as stated is a standard static timing analysis (STA) exercise for a digital logic path. All parameters are provided with consistent units (or units that are easily converted, such as $1\\ \\mathrm{ns} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{ps}$), and the terminology used (clock-to-Q, setup/hold time, clock uncertainty, useful skew) is standard in the field of integrated circuit design. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe solution requires deriving two constraints on the useful skew, $S$, from the setup and hold timing requirements, and then finding the maximum value of $S$ that satisfies both.\n\nFirst, let us establish the setup time constraint. The setup check ensures that data launched from the source flip-flop has enough time to travel through the combinational path and arrive at the destination flip-flop's input before the setup window of the next capture clock edge.\n\nLet the clock period be $T$. A clock edge at the launch flip-flop occurs at time $t=0$, launching data. The corresponding capture clock edge for this data will occur one cycle later. At the launch flip-flop, this next edge is at time $T$. Due to the positive useful skew $S$, this capture clock edge arrives at the capture flip-flop at time $T + S$.\n\nThe data must be stable at the capture flip-flop's input at least a time $t_{\\mathrm{setup}}$ before this capture edge. Accounting for clock uncertainty $U_{\\mathrm{setup}}$, which reduces the available time, the latest required arrival time for the data, $t_{\\mathrm{req}}$, is:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{req}} = (T + S) - t_{\\mathrm{setup}} - U_{\\mathrm{setup}}$$\nThe latest the data will actually arrive, $t_{\\mathrm{arrival}}^{\\max}$, is determined by the longest possible path delay, which includes the maximum clock-to-Q delay of the launch flip-flop and the maximum delay of the combinational logic:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{arrival}}^{\\max} = t_{\\mathrm{cq}}^{\\max} + d_{\\max}$$\nThe setup constraint requires $t_{\\mathrm{arrival}}^{\\max} \\le t_{\\mathrm{req}}$. The setup slack, $\\mathrm{Slack}_{\\mathrm{setup}}$, is defined as the difference $t_{\\mathrm{req}} - t_{\\mathrm{arrival}}^{\\max}$.\n$$\\mathrm{Slack}_{\\mathrm{setup}}(S) = (T + S - t_{\\mathrm{setup}} - U_{\\mathrm{setup}}) - (t_{\\mathrm{cq}}^{\\max} + d_{\\max})$$\nThe problem requires improving the setup margin by at least $100\\ \\mathrm{ps}$. The setup margin (or slack) improvement is the difference between the slack with skew $S$ and the slack with zero skew ($S=0$).\n$$\\mathrm{Slack}_{\\mathrm{setup}}(S=0) = (T - t_{\\mathrm{setup}} - U_{\\mathrm{setup}}) - (t_{\\mathrm{cq}}^{\\max} + d_{\\max})$$\nThe improvement in setup slack is:\n$$\\Delta \\mathrm{Slack}_{\\mathrm{setup}} = \\mathrm{Slack}_{\\mathrm{setup}}(S) - \\mathrm{Slack}_{\\mathrm{setup}}(S=0) = S$$\nThe requirement is that this improvement is at least $100\\ \\mathrm{ps}$. This gives the first constraint on $S$:\n$$S \\ge 100\\ \\mathrm{ps}$$\n\nSecond, let us establish the hold time constraint. The hold check ensures that new data launched from the source flip-flop does not arrive too early and corrupt the data currently being captured by the destination flip-flop. The check is performed at the same clock edge.\n\nA clock edge occurs at the launch flip-flop at time $t=0$. The earliest the new data can arrive at the capture flip-flop's input, $t_{\\mathrm{arrival}}^{\\min}$, is determined by the shortest possible path delay:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{arrival}}^{\\min} = t_{\\mathrm{cq}}^{\\min} + d_{\\min}$$\nThe capture clock edge corresponding to this launch edge arrives at the capture flip-flop at time $S$. The data being captured at this edge must remain stable for a duration of $t_{\\mathrm{hold}}$ after the edge. Including the hold uncertainty $U_{\\mathrm{hold}}$, which adds to the required hold time, the data input must not change until time $t_{\\mathrm{stable}}$:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{stable}} = S + t_{\\mathrm{hold}} + U_{\\mathrm{hold}}$$\nThe hold constraint requires that the new data does not arrive before this time: $t_{\\mathrm{arrival}}^{\\min} \\ge t_{\\mathrm{stable}}$.\n$$t_{\\mathrm{cq}}^{\\min} + d_{\\min} \\ge S + t_{\\mathrm{hold}} + U_{\\mathrm{hold}}$$\nThis inequality provides an upper bound on the allowable skew $S$:\n$$S \\le t_{\\mathrm{cq}}^{\\min} + d_{\\min} - t_{\\mathrm{hold}} - U_{\\mathrm{hold}}$$\n\nCombining the two constraints, we have a valid range for $S$:\n$$100\\ \\mathrm{ps} \\le S \\le t_{\\mathrm{cq}}^{\\min} + d_{\\min} - t_{\\mathrm{hold}} - U_{\\mathrm{hold}}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values to find the upper bound:\n- $t_{\\mathrm{cq}}^{\\min} = 30\\ \\mathrm{ps}$\n- $d_{\\min} = 150\\ \\mathrm{ps}$\n- $t_{\\mathrm{hold}} = 20\\ \\mathrm{ps}$\n- $U_{\\mathrm{hold}} = 25\\ \\mathrm{ps}$\n\n$$S \\le 30\\ \\mathrm{ps} + 150\\ \\mathrm{ps} - 20\\ \\mathrm{ps} - 25\\ \\mathrm{ps}$$\n$$S \\le 180\\ \\mathrm{ps} - 45\\ \\mathrm{ps}$$\n$$S \\le 135\\ \\mathrm{ps}$$\nThe full condition on $S$ is therefore:\n$$100\\ \\mathrm{ps} \\le S \\le 135\\ \\mathrm{ps}$$\nThe problem asks for the largest value of $S$ that satisfies both conditions. This is the upper limit of the derived range.\n$$S_{\\max} = 135\\ \\mathrm{ps}$$\nThe value $135$ has three significant figures, as required for the final answer.\nThe other parameters given ($t_{\\mathrm{cq}}^{\\max}$, $d_{\\max}$, $T$, $t_{\\mathrm{setup}}$, $U_{\\mathrm{setup}}$) were necessary to correctly formulate the setup timing principle, but their numerical values were not needed to determine the *improvement* in setup margin, which simplifies to just $S$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of the root-mean-square (RMS) time jitter of a clock oscillator, integrated over a specified frequency band, starting from fundamental definitions.\n\nThe solution is structured as follows:\n1.  Establish the relationship between single-sideband (SSB) phase noise, $L(f)$, and the power spectral density (PSD) of phase fluctuations, $S_{\\phi}(f)$.\n2.  Relate the phase fluctuations to time fluctuations (jitter), thereby deriving the PSD of time jitter, $S_j(f)$.\n3.  Integrate $S_j(f)$ over the specified frequency band $[f_{\\mathrm{L}}, f_{\\mathrm{H}}]$ to find the mean-square jitter, $\\sigma_j^2$.\n4.  Calculate the final numerical value for the RMS jitter, $\\sigma_j$.\n\nFirst, we relate the linear SSB phase noise power ratio, $L_{\\mathrm{lin}}(f)$, to the phase fluctuation PSD, $S_{\\phi}(f)$. For small phase fluctuations (the regime where phase noise is typically specified), the total power in the phase modulation sidebands, normalized to the carrier power, is given by the integral of $S_{\\phi}(f)$. The SSB phase noise, $L(f)$, represents the power in a single sideband relative to the carrier, in a $1\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ bandwidth. The relationship is:\n$$S_{\\phi}(f) = 2 L_{\\mathrm{lin}}(f)$$\nThe units of $S_{\\phi}(f)$ are $\\mathrm{rad}^2/\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\nSecond, we connect an instantaneous phase fluctuation, $\\phi(t)$, to the corresponding time jitter, $j(t)$. A sinusoidal carrier signal with phase noise can be represented as $v(t) = A \\cos(2\\pi f_0 t + \\phi(t))$, where $f_0$ is the carrier frequency. A phase deviation of $\\phi$ radians from the ideal linear phase $2\\pi f_0 t$ corresponds to a time deviation $j$ such that the phase change $2\\pi f_0 j$ matches $\\phi$. Thus, for small fluctuations:\n$$j(t) = \\frac{\\phi(t)}{2\\pi f_0}$$\nThis linear relationship in the time domain implies a squared relationship for their respective power spectral densities. The PSD of the time jitter, $S_j(f)$, is related to the PSD of the phase fluctuations, $S_{\\phi}(f)$, by:\n$$S_j(f) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2\\pi f_0}\\right)^2 S_{\\phi}(f)$$\nThe units of $S_j(f)$ are $\\mathrm{s}^2/\\mathrm{Hz}$. Combining the two relationships, we express the time jitter PSD directly in terms of the SSB phase noise:\n$$S_j(f) = \\frac{2 L_{\\mathrm{lin}}(f)}{(2\\pi f_0)^2} = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{lin}}(f)}{2 \\pi^2 f_0^2}$$\n\nThe problem states that the SSB phase noise follows an inverse-square law in the linear domain over the frequency range of interest $f \\in [f_{\\mathrm{L}}, f_{\\mathrm{H}}]$:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{lin}}(f) = L_{\\mathrm{lin}}(f_{1}) \\left(\\frac{f_{1}}{f}\\right)^{2}$$\nSubstituting this model into the expression for $S_j(f)$ yields:\n$$S_j(f) = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi^2 f_0^2} \\left[ L_{\\mathrm{lin}}(f_{1}) \\left(\\frac{f_{1}}{f}\\right)^{2} \\right] = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{lin}}(f_{1}) f_1^2}{2 \\pi^2 f_0^2} \\frac{1}{f^2}$$\n\nThe mean-square time jitter, $\\sigma_j^2$, is the integral of $S_j(f)$ from the lower frequency limit $f_{\\mathrm{L}}$ to the upper limit $f_{\\mathrm{H}}$:\n$$\\sigma_j^2 = \\int_{f_{\\mathrm{L}}}^{f_{\\mathrm{H}}} S_j(f) \\, df = \\int_{f_{\\mathrm{L}}}^{f_{\\mathrm{H}}} \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{lin}}(f_{1}) f_1^2}{2 \\pi^2 f_0^2} \\frac{1}{f^2} \\, df$$\nThe term involving the given parameters is constant with respect to the integration variable $f$.\n$$\\sigma_j^2 = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{lin}}(f_{1}) f_1^2}{2 \\pi^2 f_0^2} \\int_{f_{\\mathrm{L}}}^{f_{\\mathrm{H}}} f^{-2} \\, df$$\nThe integral evaluates to:\n$$\\int_{f_{\\mathrm{L}}}^{f_{\\mathrm{H}}} f^{-2} \\, df = \\left[ -f^{-1} \\right]_{f_{\\mathrm{L}}}^{f_{\\mathrm{H}}} = \\left(-\\frac{1}{f_{\\mathrm{H}}}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{f_{\\mathrm{L}}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{f_{\\mathrm{L}}} - \\frac{1}{f_{\\mathrm{H}}}$$\nTherefore, the mean-square time jitter is given by the analytical expression:\n$$\\sigma_j^2 = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{lin}}(f_{1}) f_1^2}{2 \\pi^2 f_0^2} \\left(\\frac{1}{f_{\\mathrm{L}}} - \\frac{1}{f_{\\mathrm{H}}}\\right)$$\nThe RMS time jitter, $\\sigma_j$, is the square root of this value.\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values:\nCarrier frequency: $f_0 = 2\\,\\mathrm{GHz} = 2 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$\nReference offset frequency: $f_1 = 1\\,\\mathrm{MHz} = 1 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$\nIntegration limits: $f_{\\mathrm{L}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{kHz} = 1 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ and $f_{\\mathrm{H}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{MHz} = 1 \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$\nSSB phase noise at $f_1$: $L(f_1) = -100\\,\\mathrm{dBc/Hz}$\n\nFirst, we convert the decibel value $L(f_1)$ to its linear form $L_{\\mathrm{lin}}(f_1)$:\n$$L(f_1) = 10 \\log_{10}(L_{\\mathrm{lin}}(f_1)) \\implies L_{\\mathrm{lin}}(f_1) = 10^{L(f_1)/10}$$\n$$L_{\\mathrm{lin}}(f_1) = 10^{-100/10} = 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}$$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\sigma_j^2$:\n$$\\sigma_j^2 = \\frac{(10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}) (1 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Hz})^2}{2 \\pi^2 (2 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Hz})^2} \\left(\\frac{1}{1 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{Hz}} - \\frac{1}{1 \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{Hz}}\\right)$$\n$$\\sigma_j^2 = \\frac{10^{-10} \\cdot 10^{12}}{2 \\pi^2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 10^{18}} \\left(10^{-4} - 10^{-7}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{s}^2$$\n$$\\sigma_j^2 = \\frac{10^2}{8 \\pi^2 \\cdot 10^{18}} \\left(10^{-4} - 0.001 \\cdot 10^{-4}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{s}^2$$\n$$\\sigma_j^2 = \\frac{100}{8 \\pi^2 \\cdot 10^{18}} \\left(0.999 \\cdot 10^{-4}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{s}^2$$\n$$\\sigma_j^2 = \\frac{99.9}{8 \\pi^2} \\times 10^{-22}\\,\\mathrm{s}^2$$\nUsing $\\pi \\approx 3.14159265$:\n$$\\sigma_j^2 \\approx \\frac{99.9}{8 \\cdot 9.8696044} \\times 10^{-22}\\,\\mathrm{s}^2 \\approx \\frac{99.9}{78.956835} \\times 10^{-22}\\,\\mathrm{s}^2 \\approx 1.26524 \\times 10^{-22}\\,\\mathrm{s}^2$$\n\nTaking the square root to find the RMS jitter $\\sigma_j$:\n$$\\sigma_j = \\sqrt{1.26524 \\times 10^{-22}\\,\\mathrm{s}^2} \\approx 1.12483 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer in picoseconds ($1\\,\\mathrm{ps} = 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{s}$).\n$$\\sigma_j \\approx 1.12483 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 11.2483 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 11.2483\\,\\mathrm{ps}$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$\\sigma_j \\approx 11.25\\,\\mathrm{ps}$$",

The inverse Q-function $Q^{-1}(p)$ is equivalent to the inverse of the standard normal cumulative distribution function (CDF), $\\Phi^{-1}(1-p)$.\nFor $BER_1 = 10^{-6}$:\n$$N_1 = Q^{-1}(10^{-6}) \\approx 4.75342$$\nFor $BER_2 = 10^{-12}$:\n$$N_2 = Q^{-1}(10^{-12}) \\approx 7.03441$$\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, $\\sigma_{RJ}$ and $DJ$:\n$$27.21 = DJ + 2 \\times N_1 \\times \\sigma_{RJ} \\quad \\implies \\quad 27.21 = DJ + 2 \\times 4.75342 \\times \\sigma_{RJ} \\quad (1)$$\n$$34.51 = DJ + 2 \\times N_2 \\times \\sigma_{RJ} \\quad \\implies \\quad 34.51 = DJ + 2 \\times 7.03441 \\times \\sigma_{RJ} \\quad (2)$$\nSubstituting the numerical values for the coefficients:\n$$(1) \\quad 27.21 = DJ + 9.50684 \\cdot \\sigma_{RJ}$$\n$$(2) \\quad 34.51 = DJ + 14.06882 \\cdot \\sigma_{RJ}$$\nSubtracting equation (1) from equation (2) eliminates $DJ$:\n$$34.51 - 27.21 = (14.06882 - 9.50684) \\cdot \\sigma_{RJ}$$\n$$7.30 = 4.56198 \\cdot \\sigma_{RJ}$$\nSolving for $\\sigma_{RJ}$:\n$$\\sigma_{RJ} = \\frac{7.30}{4.56198} \\approx 1.599965 \\, \\text{ps}$$\nSubstituting this value back into equation (1) to find $DJ$:\n$$27.21 = DJ + 9.50684 \\times 1.599965$$\n$$27.21 = DJ + 15.2106$$\n$$DJ = 27.21 - 15.2106 = 11.9994 \\, \\text{ps}$$\nRounding the results to $4$ significant figures as requested:\n$$\\sigma_{RJ} \\approx 1.600 \\, \\text{ps}$$\n$$DJ \\approx 12.00 \\, \\text{ps}$$\n\n### Part 3: Verification with Period Jitter\n\nPeriod jitter (or cycle-to-cycle jitter, $J_{cc}$) is the variation in clock period from one cycle to the next. If $t_i$ is the time of the $i$-th edge, the period jitter for cycle $i$ is $J_{cc, i} = (t_i - t_{i-1}) - T_{mean}$, where $T_{mean}$ is the average clock period. The jitter component of this is $\\Delta t_i - \\Delta t_{i-1}$.\n\nThe problem states that cycle-to-cycle random fluctuations can be treated as independent. This means the random jitter on consecutive edges, $RJ_i$ and $RJ_{i-1}$, are independent random variables. Both are drawn from the same distribution with variance $\\sigma_{RJ}^2$.\nThe variance of the random component of the period jitter is the sum of the variances of the individual edge jitters: $\\text{Var}(J_{\\text{cc, random}}) = \\text{Var}(RJ_i - RJ_{i-1}) = \\text{Var}(RJ_i) + \\text{Var}(RJ_{i-1}) = \\sigma_{RJ}^2 + \\sigma_{RJ}^2 = 2\\sigma_{RJ}^2$.\nThe RMS value of the random period jitter is the square root of its variance: $J_{\\text{cc, RMS}} = \\sqrt{2\\sigma_{RJ}^2} = \\sigma_{RJ} \\sqrt{2}$.\nUsing our calculated value for $\\sigma_{RJ}$ (before rounding for better precision):\n$$J_{\\text{cc, RMS}} \\approx 1.599965 \\, \\text{ps} \\times \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.599965 \\times 1.41421356 \\approx 2.26274 \\, \\text{ps}$$\nThe measured period jitter RMS is given as $2.263$ ps.\nComparing the calculated value ($2.26274$ ps) with the measured value ($2.263$ ps) shows an excellent agreement. The values match when rounded to four significant figures, confirming the consistency of the jitter model and the calculated parameters with the available measurements.",
