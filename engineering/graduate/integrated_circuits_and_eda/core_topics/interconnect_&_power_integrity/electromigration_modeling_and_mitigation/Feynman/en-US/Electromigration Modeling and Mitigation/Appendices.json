            "introduction": "The cornerstone of electromigration lifetime prediction is Black's equation, an empirical model that relates mean time to failure (MTTF) to current density and temperature. To use this model effectively, its parameters—the activation energy $E_a$ and the current density exponent $n$—must be determined experimentally for each specific semiconductor technology. This first exercise guides you through the fundamental process of using data from accelerated life tests to extract these critical parameters, a common task for reliability engineers . You will discover how, with limited data, we can establish a precise relationship between the model parameters even if we cannot uniquely identify each one.",

            "problem": "In advanced interconnect reliability for Integrated Circuits and Electronic Design Automation (EDA), electromigration is modeled by combining two well-tested bases: (i) atomic transport governed by a thermally activated process with an Arrhenius temperature dependence, and (ii) a current-density-driven damage acceleration that follows a power-law scaling with current density. Specifically, the atomic jump rate is proportional to $\\exp(-E_a/(k_B T))$, where $E_a$ is an activation energy and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and the electromigration damage rate accelerates with current density $J$ according to a power exponent $n$. The mean time to failure (MTTF), denoted $t$, scales inversely with the damage rate. Consider a single-level copper interconnect with constant cross-section and identical microstructure across tests (no significant self-heating). Two accelerated test conditions are applied:\n- Test 1: current density $J_1 = 1.0 \\times 10^6 \\, \\mathrm{A/cm^2}$ and absolute temperature $T_1 = 423 \\, \\mathrm{K}$, with measured mean time to failure $t_1 = 200 \\, \\mathrm{h}$.\n- Test 2: current density $J_2 = 0.9 \\times 10^6 \\, \\mathrm{A/cm^2}$ and absolute temperature $T_2 = 398 \\, \\mathrm{K}$, with measured mean time to failure $t_2 = 1000 \\, \\mathrm{h}$.\nStarting from the Arrhenius law for thermally activated processes and the power-law acceleration with current density for electromigration damage, derive the dependence of $t$ on $J$ and $T$ using material-dependent constants $E_a$, $n$, and a prefactor $A$. Using only the two tests above, eliminate the prefactor $A$ and solve for the exact functional relationship between $E_a$ and $n$ that is consistent with both measurements. Express the activation energy $E_a$ as a closed-form analytic function of $n$, using the Boltzmann constant $k_B$ in electronvolts per Kelvin so that $E_a$ is in electronvolts. Provide your final expression in exact form; do not approximate or round. Additionally, explain whether $A$ is identifiable without additional data, and comment on the individual identifiability of $E_a$ and $n$ from only these two points.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Model Premise (i)**: Atomic transport is governed by a thermally activated process with an Arrhenius temperature dependence, where the rate is proportional to $\\exp(-E_a/(k_B T))$. Here, $E_a$ is the activation energy, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n- **Model Premise (ii)**: Electromigration damage rate accelerates with current density $J$ according to a power-law scaling with exponent $n$.\n- **Model Premise (iii)**: The mean time to failure (MTTF), denoted $t$, scales inversely with the damage rate.\n- **Test 1 Data**: Current density $J_1 = 1.0 \\times 10^6 \\, \\mathrm{A/cm^2}$, absolute temperature $T_1 = 423 \\, \\mathrm{K}$, measured MTTF $t_1 = 200 \\, \\mathrm{h}$.\n- **Test 2 Data**: Current density $J_2 = 0.9 \\times 10^6 \\, \\mathrm{A/cm^2}$, absolute temperature $T_2 = 398 \\, \\mathrm{K}$, measured MTTF $t_2 = 1000 \\, \\mathrm{h}$.\n- **Constants and Variables**: $E_a$ (activation energy), $n$ (current density exponent), $A$ (prefactor), $k_B$ (Boltzmann constant).\n- **Constraints**: Single-level copper interconnect, constant cross-section, identical microstructure, no significant self-heating.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is grounded in the well-established physics of semiconductor reliability. The model described is a standard formulation of Black's equation, the cornerstone empirical model for predicting electromigration lifetime. The physical premises—thermally activated atomic diffusion and current-driven momentum transfer—are correct.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem requests a functional relationship between two unknown parameters, $E_a$ and $n$, using two data points. With three unknowns ($A$, $E_a$, $n$) and two measurement sets, it is not possible to find unique values for all three. However, the problem correctly directs the user to eliminate the prefactor $A$ and find a locus of solutions for ($E_a$, $n$), which is a mathematically sound and well-posed task. The questions regarding parameter identifiability are also standard and meaningful in the context of model fitting.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and objective language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The data provided ($J_1, T_1, t_1$ and $J_2, T_2, t_2$) are sufficient to establish the required relationship between $E_a$ and $n$. There are no internal contradictions.\n- **Realism**: The specified values for current density (on the order of $10^6 \\, \\mathrm{A/cm^2}$) and temperature ($398 \\, \\mathrm{K} \\approx 125 \\, ^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ and $423 \\, \\mathrm{K} \\approx 150 \\, ^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$) are typical for accelerated life testing of metallic interconnects in integrated circuits.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and internally consistent. It represents a standard analysis in the field of microelectronics reliability engineering. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be constructed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the relationship between the mean time to failure ($t$), current density ($J$), and temperature ($T$).\n\nBased on the premises, the damage rate, $R_{damage}$, is proportional to the product of the current-density-dependent term and the temperature-dependent term.\nThe current density term is a power law, $J^n$.\nThe temperature term is an Arrhenius law, $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{k_B T}\\right)$.\nThus, the damage rate is:\n$$ R_{damage} \\propto J^n \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nThe mean time to failure, $t$, is inversely proportional to the damage rate:\n$$ t \\propto \\frac{1}{R_{damage}} \\propto \\frac{1}{J^n \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{k_B T}\\right)} $$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$ t \\propto J^{-n} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_a}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nIntroducing a proportionality constant, or prefactor, $A$, which encapsulates material properties, geometry, and other factors not dependent on $J$ or $T$, we obtain the standard form of Black's equation:\n$$ t = A J^{-n} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_a}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nThis is the dependence of $t$ on $J$ and $T$.\n\nNow, we apply this equation to the two given test conditions:\nFor Test 1:\n$$ t_1 = A J_1^{-n} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_a}{k_B T_1}\\right) $$\nFor Test 2:\n$$ t_2 = A J_2^{-n} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_a}{k_B T_2}\\right) $$\n\nTo eliminate the prefactor $A$, we take the ratio of these two equations:\n$$ \\frac{t_1}{t_2} = \\frac{A J_1^{-n} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_a}{k_B T_1}\\right)}{A J_2^{-n} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_a}{k_B T_2}\\right)} $$\n$$ \\frac{t_1}{t_2} = \\left(\\frac{J_1}{J_2}\\right)^{-n} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_a}{k_B T_1} - \\frac{E_a}{k_B T_2}\\right) $$\nUsing the property $(a/b)^{-n} = (b/a)^n$ and factoring out $E_a/k_B$:\n$$ \\frac{t_1}{t_2} = \\left(\\frac{J_2}{J_1}\\right)^{n} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_a}{k_B} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2}\\right)\\right) $$\nTo solve for the relationship between $E_a$ and $n$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{t_1}{t_2}\\right) = \\ln\\left[ \\left(\\frac{J_2}{J_1}\\right)^{n} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_a}{k_B} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2}\\right)\\right) \\right] $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{t_1}{t_2}\\right) = n \\ln\\left(\\frac{J_2}{J_1}\\right) + \\frac{E_a}{k_B} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2}\\right) $$\nThis equation represents the exact functional relationship between $E_a$ and $n$ consistent with the experimental data.\n\nTo express $E_a$ as a function of $n$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$ \\frac{E_a}{k_B} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{t_1}{t_2}\\right) - n \\ln\\left(\\frac{J_2}{J_1}\\right) $$\nCombining the fractions in the temperature term:\n$$ \\frac{E_a}{k_B} \\left(\\frac{T_2 - T_1}{T_1 T_2}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{t_1}{t_2}\\right) - n \\ln\\left(\\frac{J_2}{J_1}\\right) $$\nIsolating $E_a$:\n$$ E_a = k_B \\left(\\frac{T_1 T_2}{T_2 - T_1}\\right) \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{t_1}{t_2}\\right) - n \\ln\\left(\\frac{J_2}{J_1}\\right) \\right] $$\nNow, we substitute the provided exact numerical values:\n- $t_1 = 200$\n- $t_2 = 1000$\n- $J_1 = 1.0 \\times 10^6$\n- $J_2 = 0.9 \\times 10^6$\n- $T_1 = 423$\n- $T_2 = 398$\n\nThis gives:\n- $\\frac{t_1}{t_2} = \\frac{200}{1000} = \\frac{1}{5}$\n- $\\frac{J_2}{J_1} = \\frac{0.9 \\times 10^6}{1.0 \\times 10^6} = 0.9$\n- $T_1 T_2 = 423 \\times 398 = 168354$\n- $T_2 - T_1 = 398 - 423 = -25$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $E_a$:\n$$ E_a = k_B \\left(\\frac{168354}{-25}\\right) \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) - n \\ln(0.9) \\right] $$\nUsing the logarithm properties $\\ln(1/x) = -\\ln(x)$:\n$$ E_a = k_B \\left(-\\frac{168354}{25}\\right) \\left[ -\\ln(5) - n \\ln(0.9) \\right] $$\nFactoring out the negative sign from the brackets:\n$$ E_a = k_B \\left(\\frac{168354}{25}\\right) \\left[ \\ln(5) + n \\ln(0.9) \\right] $$\nThis is the final closed-form analytic function for $E_a$ in terms of $n$. The problem states that if $k_B$ is in eV/K, $E_a$ will be in eV, which is consistent with this formula as the term multiplying $k_B$ is dimensionless.\n\n### Identifiability Analysis\n\n**Identifiability of $A$**:\nThe prefactor $A$ is not identifiable from the two given data points. To find $A$ from the equation $t = A J^{-n} \\exp(E_a/(k_B T))$, one would first need to know the unique values of both $E_a$ and $n$. As shown below, $E_a$ and $n$ are themselves not uniquely identifiable. Since their values are constrained to a locus of possibilities, $A$ will also have a corresponding range of possible values. A third independent test condition ($J_3, T_3, t_3$) would be required to uniquely solve for all three parameters ($A$, $n$, $E_a$).\n\n**Individual Identifiability of $E_a$ and $n$**:\nThe parameters $E_a$ and $n$ are not individually identifiable from only two data points. The relationship derived,\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{t_1}{t_2}\\right) = n \\ln\\left(\\frac{J_2}{J_1}\\right) + \\frac{E_a}{k_B} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2}\\right) $$\nis a single linear equation in the two variables $E_a$ and $n$. A single linear equation with two unknowns defines a line in the ($n$, $E_a$) parameter space. Any pair of ($n$, $Ea$) values that lies on this line is a valid solution that perfectly explains the two data points. To determine a unique value for both $n$ and $E_a$, one would need a second, independent linear equation. This would require data from at least a third accelerated test, which would allow for the unique determination of the intersection point of the two resulting lines, thereby uniquely identifying the parameter pair ($n$, $E_a$). With only two tests, the system is underdetermined.",

            "introduction": "While DC electromigration is driven by a constant force, the behavior under alternating current (AC) is governed by the dynamic interplay between the electron wind and the resulting mechanical stress. Pure AC currents are often less damaging because the stress built up during one half-cycle can be relaxed during the next, but this cancellation is not always perfect. This advanced exercise delves into the underlying physics using a simplified Korhonen model to explore why bidirectional AC currents can be electromigration-immune and to quantify the residual risk that arises when the stress relaxation time is slower than the current reversal frequency .",

            "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional copper interconnect segment of length $L$ with perfectly blocking boundaries, operated at uniform temperature $T$. The conductor carries a bidirectional alternating current with zero direct-current component, modeled as $J(t) = J_{0} \\sin(\\omega t)$, where $J_{0}$ is the current density amplitude and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency. The system exhibits electromigration (EM) driven by the electron wind and counteracted by stress build-up due to constrained atomic motion. Assume the line is well described by the single dominant stress-relaxation mode approximation of the Korhonen stress evolution, in which the spatially averaged stress gradient $g(t) = \\partial \\sigma / \\partial x$ obeys a first-order relaxation towards the instantaneous equilibrium gradient at a rate set by a relaxation time $\\tau_{s}$.\n\nUse only the following fundamental relationships and facts:\n- The atomic (or vacancy) flux under electromigration in a one-dimensional conductor with blocking ends is\n$$\nj(x,t) = \\frac{C D}{k_{B} T} \\left( Z^{*} e \\rho \\, J(t) - \\Omega \\frac{\\partial \\sigma(x,t)}{\\partial x} \\right),\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the relevant concentration (e.g., atomic or vacancy), $D$ is the diffusivity, $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $Z^{*}$ is the effective charge number, $e$ is the elementary charge, $\\rho$ is the resistivity, and $\\Omega$ is the atomic volume.\n- In the single-mode approximation for a line with blocking boundaries, the spatially averaged stress gradient $g(t)$ follows a first-order relaxation towards the instantaneous equilibrium gradient, which balances the electron-wind force.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It describes a standard, albeit simplified, model of electromigration (EM) in an interconnect line under alternating current (AC) stress. The provided equations are fundamental to the Korhonen model of stress evolution, and the tasks are well-defined mathematical derivations based on these premises. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\n**Part 1: Electromigration Immunity under Bidirectional AC Current**\n\nThe net mass transport due to electromigration is proportional to the time-averaged atomic flux, $\\langle j(x,t) \\rangle$. The system is considered immune to long-term degradation if this average flux is zero. The given expression for the atomic flux is:\n$$\nj(x,t) = \\frac{C D}{k_{B} T} \\left( Z^{*} e \\rho \\, J(t) - \\Omega \\frac{\\partial \\sigma(x,t)}{\\partial x} \\right)\n$$\nThe problem specifies using a single-mode approximation where the spatially averaged stress gradient, $g(t)$, represents the term $\\partial \\sigma(x,t) / \\partial x$. Therefore, the average flux can be approximated as:\n$$\nj(t) \\approx \\frac{C D}{k_{B} T} \\left( Z^{*} e \\rho \\, J(t) - \\Omega g(t) \\right)\n$$\nTo find the time-averaged net flux, we average this expression over one period of the AC signal, $T_{p} = 2\\pi/\\omega$:\n$$\n\\langle j \\rangle \\approx \\frac{C D}{k_{B} T} \\left( Z^{*} e \\rho \\, \\langle J(t) \\rangle - \\Omega \\langle g(t) \\rangle \\right)\n$$\nThe current density is given as $J(t) = J_{0} \\sin(\\omega t)$. This is a purely sinusoidal function with no DC offset. Its time average over a full period is zero:\n$$\n\\langle J(t) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{T_{p}} \\int_{0}^{T_{p}} J_{0} \\sin(\\omega t) \\, \\mathrm{d}t = 0\n$$\nThe spatially averaged stress gradient $g(t)$ is governed by the first-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\n\\tau_{s} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} g(t)}{\\mathrm{d} t} + g(t) = \\frac{Z^{*} e \\rho}{\\Omega} \\, J(t)\n$$\nThis is a linear system. Since the forcing function, $J(t)$, is periodic with a zero mean, the steady-state solution $g(t)$ must also be periodic with the same frequency and have a zero mean. We can show this formally by time-averaging the entire ODE over one period:\n$$\n\\left\\langle \\tau_{s} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} g(t)}{\\mathrm{d} t} \\right\\rangle + \\langle g(t) \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\frac{Z^{*} e \\rho}{\\Omega} \\, J(t) \\right\\rangle = \\frac{Z^{*} e \\rho}{\\Omega} \\langle J(t) \\rangle\n$$\nSince $\\langle J(t) \\rangle = 0$, the right-hand side is zero. For any periodic function $g(t)$, the average of its derivative over a period is also zero:\n$$\n\\left\\langle \\frac{\\mathrm{d} g(t)}{\\mathrm{d} t} \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{T_{p}} \\int_{0}^{T_{p}} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} g(t)}{\\mathrm{d} t} \\, \\mathrm{d}t = \\frac{g(T_{p}) - g(0)}{T_{p}} = 0\n$$\nThus, the averaged ODE simplifies to $\\langle g(t) \\rangle = 0$.\n\nSubstituting $\\langle J(t) \\rangle = 0$ and $\\langle g(t) \\rangle = 0$ into the expression for the average flux, we find:\n$$\n\\langle j \\rangle \\approx \\frac{C D}{k_{B} T} \\left( Z^{*} e \\rho \\cdot 0 - \\Omega \\cdot 0 \\right) = 0\n$$\nSince the time-averaged net mass transport is zero, the material displaced during one half-cycle of the current is returned during the subsequent half-cycle. This shows why a bidirectional AC current with a zero DC component is considered, in this idealized model, to be immune to long-term net electromigration damage.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Residual Risk Factor $\\mathcal{R}$**\n\nThe residual risk arises because the stress gradient $g(t)$ may not perfectly and instantaneously track the driving current $J(t)$, leading to a non-zero instantaneous unbalanced force. The risk factor $\\mathcal{R}$ is the ratio of the root-mean-square (RMS) of this unbalanced force to the RMS of the driving force in the absence of any stress-gradient backforce.\n\nThe unbalanced electromigration driving term is the net force term within the flux equation, which we denote as $F_{\\text{net}}(t)$:\n$$\nF_{\\text{net}}(t) = Z^{*} e \\rho \\, J(t) - \\Omega g(t)\n$$\nFrom the governing ODE for $g(t)$, we can directly express this term:\n$$\nF_{\\text{net}}(t) = \\Omega \\tau_{s} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} g(t)}{\\mathrm{d} t}\n$$\nThe driving term in the hypothetical case of no stress shielding ($g(t)=0$) is:\n$$\nF_{\\text{no\\_stress}}(t) = Z^{*} e \\rho \\, J(t)\n$$\nThe risk factor is defined as:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\langle F_{\\text{net}}(t)^2 \\rangle}}{\\sqrt{\\langle F_{\\text{no\\_stress}}(t)^2 \\rangle}}\n$$\nTo evaluate this, we first need the steady-state solution for $g(t)$. The ODE is $\\tau_{s} g'(t) + g(t) = K J(t)$ where $K = Z^{*} e \\rho / \\Omega$ and $J(t) = J_{0} \\sin(\\omega t)$. Using the method of undetermined coefficients, or complex phasors, the steady-state solution $g_{ss}(t)$ is of the form $A \\sin(\\omega t) + B \\cos(\\omega t)$. A standard result for this first-order system is:\n$$\ng_{ss}(t) = \\frac{K J_{0}}{1 + (\\omega \\tau_{s})^2} \\left[ \\sin(\\omega t) - \\omega \\tau_{s} \\cos(\\omega t) \\right]\n$$\nNow, we find its derivative to compute $F_{\\text{net}}(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d} g_{ss}(t)}{\\mathrm{d} t} = \\frac{K J_{0}}{1 + (\\omega \\tau_{s})^2} \\left[ \\omega \\cos(\\omega t) + \\omega^2 \\tau_{s} \\sin(\\omega t) \\right] = \\frac{K J_{0} \\omega}{1 + (\\omega \\tau_{s})^2} \\left[ \\omega \\tau_{s} \\sin(\\omega t) + \\cos(\\omega t) \\right]\n$$\nThen, the unbalanced term is:\n$$\nF_{\\text{net}}(t) = \\Omega \\tau_{s} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} g_{ss}(t)}{\\mathrm{d} t} = \\Omega \\tau_{s} \\frac{(Z^{*} e \\rho / \\Omega) J_{0} \\omega}{1 + (\\omega \\tau_{s})^2} \\left[ \\omega \\tau_{s} \\sin(\\omega t) + \\cos(\\omega t) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nF_{\\text{net}}(t) = \\frac{Z^{*} e \\rho J_{0} \\omega \\tau_{s}}{1 + (\\omega \\tau_{s})^2} \\left[ \\omega \\tau_{s} \\sin(\\omega t) + \\cos(\\omega t) \\right]\n$$\nTo find the mean-square value $\\langle F_{\\text{net}}(t)^2 \\rangle$, we use the property that for a signal $A\\sin(\\omega t) + B\\cos(\\omega t)$, the mean-square is $(A^2 + B^2)/2$. Here, $A$ corresponds to the coefficient of $\\sin(\\omega t)$ and $B$ to the coefficient of $\\cos(\\omega t)$.\n$$\n\\langle F_{\\text{net}}(t)^2 \\rangle = \\left( \\frac{Z^{*} e \\rho J_{0} \\omega \\tau_{s}}{1 + (\\omega \\tau_{s})^2} \\right)^2 \\frac{(\\omega \\tau_{s})^2 + 1^2}{2} = \\frac{(Z^{*} e \\rho J_{0} \\omega \\tau_{s})^2}{2(1 + (\\omega \\tau_{s})^2)}\n$$\nThe RMS value is the square root:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\langle F_{\\text{net}}(t)^2 \\rangle} = \\frac{|Z^{*} e \\rho J_{0}| \\omega \\tau_{s}}{\\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{1 + (\\omega \\tau_{s})^2}}\n$$\nNext, we compute the RMS value for the no-stress-shielding case.\n$$\nF_{\\text{no\\_stress}}(t) = Z^{*} e \\rho J_{0} \\sin(\\omega t)\n$$\nThe RMS value of a sinusoid with amplitude $A_{0}$ is $A_{0}/\\sqrt{2}$.\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\langle F_{\\text{no\\_stress}}(t)^2 \\rangle} = \\frac{|Z^{*} e \\rho J_{0}|}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the ratio $\\mathcal{R}$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{\\frac{|Z^{*} e \\rho J_{0}| \\omega \\tau_{s}}{\\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{1 + (\\omega \\tau_{s})^2}}}{\\frac{|Z^{*} e \\rho J_{0}|}{\\sqrt{2}}} = \\frac{\\omega \\tau_{s}}{\\sqrt{1 + (\\omega \\tau_{s})^2}}\n$$\nThis expression gives the residual risk factor as a function of the dimensionless product $\\omega \\tau_{s}$, which compares the timescale of current reversal to the timescale of stress relaxation.",
