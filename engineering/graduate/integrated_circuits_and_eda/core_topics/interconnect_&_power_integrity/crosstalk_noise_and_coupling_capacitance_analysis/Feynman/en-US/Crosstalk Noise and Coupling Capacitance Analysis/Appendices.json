            "problem": "A victim interconnect in an on-chip signal network is modeled by a lumped $\\pi$-model within the context of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) crosstalk analysis. The driver is modeled as a source resistance $R_{s}$ feeding a line segment of resistance $R_{w}$ to a far-end node. The near-end node (between $R_{s}$ and $R_{w}$) has a shunt ground capacitance $C_{\\text{near}}$, and the far-end node has a shunt ground capacitance $C_{\\text{far}}$. A single aggressor line is capacitively coupled to the far-end node of the victim through a coupling capacitance $C_{c}$. Assume linear, time-invariant, Resistance-Capacitance (RC) behavior, monotonic ramp signals, and no inductive effects. The aggressor’s transition is characterized by a slope ratio $\\alpha$, defined as $\\alpha = \\frac{dV_{a}/dt}{dV_{v}/dt}$, where $V_{a}$ is the aggressor voltage and $V_{v}$ is the victim voltage at the coupled node. You may assume an Elmore delay model for the victim interconnect, defined from the first moment of the impulse response of the RC tree obtained after any admissible linearization that restores tree structure.\n\nGiven numerical parameters $R_{s} = 600~\\Omega$, $R_{w} = 400~\\Omega$, $C_{\\text{near}} = 20~\\mathrm{fF}$, $C_{\\text{far}} = 80~\\mathrm{fF}$, and $C_{c} = 30~\\mathrm{fF}$, perform the following:\n\n- Starting from the capacitor current relation $i = C \\frac{dV}{dt}$ and the Elmore-delay interpretation that the effective capacitance contribution is defined by equating the coupling current to $C_{\\text{eff}} \\frac{dV_{v}}{dt}$, derive the Miller factor $m(\\alpha)$ such that the coupling capacitance appears as an equivalent ground capacitance $C_{\\text{eff}} = m(\\alpha) C_{c}$ in the victim’s RC tree.

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. All necessary parameters and models for analysis are provided, and they are consistent with standard practices in integrated circuit design and analysis.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three stages:\n1. Derivation of the Miller factor, $m(\\alpha)$, for the coupling capacitance.\n2. Formulation of the victim's far-end Elmore delay as a function of $\\alpha$.\n3. Calculation of the change in delay, $\\Delta\\tau$, by substituting the given parameters.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Miller Factor**\n\nThe problem models an aggressor line capacitively coupled to the far-end node of a victim line. The current that flows through the coupling capacitor, $C_c$, from the victim node at voltage $V_v$ to the aggressor node at voltage $V_a$ is given by the fundamental capacitor current-voltage relationship:\n$$i_c = C_c \\frac{d}{dt}(V_v - V_a)$$\nThis current represents an additional load that the victim line's driver must supply. To analyze its effect on the victim's delay, we replace the floating capacitor $C_c$ with an equivalent grounded capacitance, $C_{\\text{eff}}$, at the victim node. This effective capacitance must draw the same amount of current from the victim node as the original coupling capacitor. Therefore, the current $i_c$ must be equal to the current drawn by $C_{\\text{eff}}$:\n$$i_c = C_{\\text{eff}} \\frac{dV_v}{dt}$$\nEquating the two expressions for $i_c$ gives:\n$$C_{\\text{eff}} \\frac{dV_v}{dt} = C_c \\frac{d}{dt}(V_v - V_a) = C_c \\left( \\frac{dV_v}{dt} - \\frac{dV_a}{dt} \\right)$$\nAssuming the victim's voltage is changing, i.e., $\\frac{dV_v}{dt} \\neq 0$, we can divide by $\\frac{dV_v}{dt}$:\n$$C_{\\text{eff}} = C_c \\left( 1 - \\frac{dV_a/dt}{dV_v/dt} \\right)$$\nThe problem defines the slope ratio as $\\alpha = \\frac{dV_a/dt}{dV_v/dt}$. Substituting this definition yields the expression for the effective capacitance:\n$$C_{\\text{eff}} = C_c (1 - \\alpha)$$\nThe Miller factor, $m(\\alpha)$, is the scaling factor that relates $C_c$ to $C_{\\text{eff}}$. From the problem definition, $C_{\\text{eff}} = m(\\alpha) C_c$. By comparison, we find:\n$$m(\\alpha) = 1 - \\alpha$$\nFor the specific case of an aggressor switching opposite to the victim with an equal-magnitude slope, $\\alpha = -1$. The Miller factor becomes:\n$$m(-1) = 1 - (-1) = 2$$\nThis result is consistent with the well-known Miller effect, where a floating impedance is amplified when connected between the input and an inverting output of a gain stage.\n\n**2. Elmore Delay Formulation**\n\nThe victim interconnect is modeled as a lumped $\\pi$-model RC network. The circuit consists of a source resistance $R_s$ connected to a near-end node (node $1$), which has a capacitance to ground $C_{\\text{near}}$. This node is connected via a wire resistance $R_w$ to a far-end node (node $2$). The far-end node has a capacitance to ground $C_{\\text{far}}$ and the coupling capacitance $C_c$.\n\nUsing the Miller factor derived above, the total effective capacitance to ground at the far-end node, $C_{\\text{total},2}$, is the sum of its intrinsic ground capacitance and the effective capacitance from the coupling effect:\n$$C_{\\text{total},2}(\\alpha) = C_{\\text{far}} + C_{\\text{eff}} = C_{\\text{far}} + m(\\alpha)C_c = C_{\\text{far}} + (1 - \\alpha)C_c$$\nThe Elmore delay at a node $i$ in an RC tree is given by $\\tau_i = \\sum_k R_{ik} C_k$, where $C_k$ is the capacitance at node $k$, and $R_{ik}$ is the resistance of the path from the voltage source to node $i$ that is common with the path from the source to node $k$.\n\nWe are calculating the delay at the far-end node (node $2$), so $\\tau_{\\text{far}} = \\tau_2$. The capacitors in the tree are $C_1 = C_{\\text{near}}$ at node $1$ and $C_2 = C_{\\text{total},2}$ at node $2$.\n- The resistance path from the source to node $2$ is $R_s + R_w$.\n- For the term involving $C_1 = C_{\\text{near}}$ at node $1$: the path from the source to node $1$ has resistance $R_s$. This path is fully contained within the path to node $2$. Thus, the common path resistance is $R_{21} = R_s$.\n- For the term involving $C_2 = C_{\\text{total},2}(\\alpha)$ at node $2$: the path from the source to node $2$ is common with itself. Thus, the common path resistance is $R_{22} = R_s + R_w$.\n\nThe Elmore delay at the far-end node is therefore:\n$$\\tau_{\\text{far}}(\\alpha) = R_{21}C_1 + R_{22}C_2 = R_s C_{\\text{near}} + (R_s + R_w) C_{\\text{total},2}(\\alpha)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_{\\text{total},2}(\\alpha)$:\n$$\\tau_{\\text{far}}(\\alpha) = R_s C_{\\text{near}} + (R_s + R_w) [C_{\\text{far}} + (1 - \\alpha)C_c]$$\n\n**3. Calculation of Change in Delay**\n\nWe need to compute the change in the victim's far-end delay, $\\Delta\\tau$, when the aggressor switches opposite with $\\alpha = -1$ relative to the case of a quiet aggressor, for which $\\alpha = 0$.\n$$\\Delta\\tau = \\tau_{\\text{far}}(\\alpha = -1) - \\tau_{\\text{far}}(\\alpha = 0)$$\nFirst, we evaluate the delay for each case.\nFor $\\alpha = -1$:\n$$\\tau_{\\text{far}}(-1) = R_s C_{\\text{near}} + (R_s + R_w) [C_{\\text{far}} + (1 - (-1))C_c] = R_s C_{\\text{near}} + (R_s + R_w) (C_{\\text{far}} + 2C_c)$$\nFor $\\alpha = 0$:\n$$\\tau_{\\text{far}}(0) = R_s C_{\\text{near}} + (R_s + R_w) [C_{\\text{far}} + (1 - 0)C_c] = R_s C_{\\text{near}} + (R_s + R_w) (C_{\\text{far}} + C_c)$$\nNow, we compute the difference:\n$$\\Delta\\tau = [R_s C_{\\text{near}} + (R_s + R_w) (C_{\\text{far}} + 2C_c)] - [R_s C_{\\text{near}} + (R_s + R_w) (C_{\\text{far}} + C_c)]$$\nSimplifying the expression, the terms $R_s C_{\\text{near}}$ and $(R_s + R_w)C_{\\text{far}}$ cancel out:\n$$\\Delta\\tau = (R_s + R_w)(2C_c) - (R_s + R_w)(C_c)$$\n$$\\Delta\\tau = (R_s + R_w)C_c$$\nThis elegant result shows that the change in delay is determined solely by the total upstream resistance to the coupled node and the coupling capacitance itself.\n\nFinally, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$R_s = 600~\\Omega$\n$R_w = 400~\\Omega$\n$C_c = 30~\\mathrm{fF} = 30 \\times 10^{-15}~\\mathrm{F}$\n\n$$\\Delta\\tau = (600~\\Omega + 400~\\Omega) \\times (30 \\times 10^{-15}~\\mathrm{F})$$\n$$\\Delta\\tau = (1000~\\Omega) \\times (30 \\times 10^{-15}~\\mathrm{F})$$\n$$\\Delta\\tau = 10^3 \\times 30 \\times 10^{-15}~\\mathrm{s}$$\n$$\\Delta\\tau = 30 \\times 10^{-12}~\\mathrm{s}$$\n$$\\Delta\\tau = 30~\\mathrm{ps}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Thus, $30~\\mathrm{ps}$ becomes $30.00~\\mathrm{ps}$.",

The standard form of the first-order linear ODE is:\n$$ \\frac{d V_v(t)}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau} V_v(t) = \\frac{C_c}{C_v + C_c} \\frac{d V_a(t)}{dt} $$\n\n**2. Solving the ODE in Two Phases**\nThe aggressor voltage $V_a(t)$ is piecewise, so we solve the ODE in two corresponding phases.\n\n**Phase 1: Ramp Input ($0 \\le t \\le T_r$)**\nDuring this interval, $V_a(t) = \\alpha t$ where $\\alpha = V_{\\mathrm{DD}}/T_r$. The derivative $\\frac{dV_a}{dt} = \\alpha$ is constant. The ODE becomes:\n$$ \\frac{d V_v(t)}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau} V_v(t) = \\frac{C_c \\alpha}{C_v + C_c} $$\nThe solution is the sum of a homogeneous solution $V_{h}(t)=A e^{-t/\\tau}$ and a particular solution $V_{p}(t)=B$. Substituting the particular solution gives $B/\\tau = \\frac{C_c \\alpha}{C_v+C_c}$, so $B = \\tau \\frac{C_c \\alpha}{C_v+C_c} = R_v(C_v+C_c) \\frac{C_c \\alpha}{C_v+C_c} = R_v C_c \\alpha$.\nThe general solution is $V_{v,1}(t) = A e^{-t/\\tau} + R_v C_c \\alpha$. Using the initial condition $V_v(0)=0$, we find $A = -R_v C_c \\alpha$.\nSo, for $0 \\le t \\le T_r$:\n$$ V_{v,1}(t) = R_v C_c \\alpha (1 - e^{-t/\\tau}) = \\frac{R_v C_c V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}{T_r} (1 - e^{-t/\\tau}) $$\n\n**Phase 2: Constant Input ($t > T_r$)**\nFor $t > T_r$, $V_a(t) = V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$, so $\\frac{dV_a}{dt} = 0$. The ODE becomes homogeneous:\n$$ \\frac{d V_v(t)}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau} V_v(t) = 0 $$\nThe solution is a simple exponential decay: $V_{v,2}(t) = K e^{-t/\\tau}$. The constant $K$ is found by enforcing continuity of the voltage at $t=T_r$, so $V_{v,2}(T_r) = V_{v,1}(T_r)$.\nThe voltage at the end of the ramp is:\n$$ V_v(T_r) = V_{v,1}(T_r) = \\frac{R_v C_c V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}{T_r} (1 - e^{-T_r/\\tau}) $$\nSetting $V_{v,2}(T_r) = V_v(T_r)$ gives $K e^{-T_r/\\tau} = V_v(T_r)$, so $K = V_v(T_r) e^{T_r/\\tau}$.\nSo, for $t > T_r$:\n$$ V_{v,2}(t) = V_v(T_r) e^{T_r/\\tau} e^{-t/\\tau} = V_v(T_r) e^{-(t-T_r)/\\tau} $$\n\n**3. Peak Voltage and Pulse Shape**\nDuring Phase 1, the derivative $\\frac{dV_{v,1}}{dt} = \\frac{R_v C_c \\alpha}{\\tau} e^{-t/\\tau}$ is always positive, so the voltage is strictly increasing. During Phase 2, the voltage is strictly decreasing. Therefore, the peak voltage $V_{\\max}$ occurs exactly at $t=T_r$.\n$$ V_{\\max} = V_v(T_r) = \\frac{R_v C_c V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}{T_r} (1 - e^{-T_r/\\tau}) $$\n\n**4. Calculating the Crossing Times and Pulse Width**\nThe problem assumes $0  V_{\\mathrm{th}}  V_{\\max}$, which guarantees two crossing times. The up-crossing, $t_{up}$, must occur in Phase 1, and the down-crossing, $t_{down}$, must occur in Phase 2.\n\n**Finding $t_{up}$:** We solve $V_{v,1}(t_{up}) = V_{\\mathrm{th}}$.\n$$ \\frac{R_v C_c V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}{T_r} (1 - e^{-t_{up}/\\tau}) = V_{\\mathrm{th}} $$\n$$ 1 - e^{-t_{up}/\\tau} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{th}} T_r}{R_v C_c V_{\\mathrm{DD}}} \\implies e^{-t_{up}/\\tau} = 1 - \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{th}} T_r}{R_v C_c V_{\\mathrm{DD}}} $$\n$$ t_{up} = -\\tau \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{th}} T_r}{R_v C_c V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}\\right) $$\n\n**Finding $t_{down}$:** We solve $V_{v,2}(t_{down}) = V_{\\mathrm{th}}$.\n$$ V_{\\max} e^{-(t_{down}-T_r)/\\tau} = V_{\\mathrm{th}} $$\n$$ e^{-(t_{down}-T_r)/\\tau} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{th}}}{V_{\\max}} \\implies -(t_{down}-T_r)/\\tau = \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{th}}}{V_{\\max}}\\right) $$\n$$ t_{down} = T_r - \\tau \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{th}}}{V_{\\max}}\\right) = T_r + \\tau \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{\\max}}{V_{\\mathrm{th}}}\\right) $$\n\n**Calculating Pulse Width $w = t_{down} - t_{up}$:**\n$$ w = \\left[ T_r + \\tau \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{\\max}}{V_{\\mathrm{th}}}\\right) \\right] - \\left[ -\\tau \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{th}} T_r}{R_v C_c V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}\\right) \\right] $$\n$$ w = T_r + \\tau \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{\\max}}{V_{\\mathrm{th}}}\\right) + \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{th}} T_r}{R_v C_c V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}\\right) \\right] $$\nCombining the logarithms and substituting the expressions for $V_{\\max}$ and $\\tau$ yields the final expression for $w$ in seconds:\n$$ w = T_r + R_v(C_v+C_c) \\ln \\left[ \\frac{R_v C_c V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}{V_{\\mathrm{th}} T_r} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T_r}{R_v(C_v+C_c)}\\right)\\right) \\left( 1 - \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{th}} T_r}{R_v C_c V_{\\mathrm{DD}}} \\right) \\right] $$\n\n**5. Effects of $R_v$ and $C_v$**\n- **Increasing $R_v$**: This increases the time constant $\\tau=R_v(C_v+C_c)$ and also the pre-factor $R_v C_c \\alpha$. Both effects contribute to increasing the peak voltage $V_{\\max}$. The slower time constant also means the decay after the peak is slower. The net result is a taller and wider glitch pulse, which increases the pulse width $w$ for a fixed threshold $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$.\n- **Increasing $C_v$**: This increases the time constant $\\tau=R_v(C_v+C_c)$ but has no effect on the pre-factor $R_v C_c \\alpha$. Because $\\tau$ increases, the term $(1 - e^{-T_r/\\tau})$ decreases, which means the peak voltage $V_{\\max}$ is reduced. This is the filtering effect of the victim's self-capacitance. While the decay time constant is longer, the dominant effect on the pulse width is the significant reduction in peak voltage. A lower peak means the voltage spends less time above a fixed threshold $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$, so increasing $C_v$ reduces the pulse width $w$.",

The underlying model is the coupled telegrapher's equations, a well-established scientific principle. The assumptions ($R' \\approx 0$, $G' \\approx 0$, $L_{m}' = 0$) are common and valid simplifications for analyzing capacitively-dominant crosstalk in many practical on-chip interconnect scenarios. The problem is self-contained, providing all necessary parameters, boundary conditions, and a well-defined source waveform. The numerical values are physically realistic for on-chip interconnects. The problem is well-posed, leading to a unique and stable solution. It is free of ambiguity, subjective claims, or scientific fallacies.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Crosstalk Waveforms**\n\nWe begin with the coupled telegrapher's equations for two lossless lines. For the victim line (line $2$), with $L_m' = 0$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial v_2}{\\partial z} = -L' \\frac{\\partial i_2}{\\partial t} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial i_2}{\\partial z} = -C' \\frac{\\partial v_2}{\\partial t} - C_m' \\frac{\\partial (v_2 - v_1)}{\\partial t} \\approx C_m' \\frac{\\partial v_1}{\\partial t} - C' \\frac{\\partial v_2}{\\partial t} $$\nIn the last step, we used the weak coupling approximation $C_m' \\ll C'$, which allows us to write $(C' + C_m') \\approx C'$. The term $C_m' \\frac{\\partial v_1}{\\partial t}$ acts as a distributed current source along the victim line. Under weak coupling, the aggressor voltage is approximately that of an uncoupled line, $v_1(z, t) = v_f(t - z/v)$.\n\nThe distributed current source is $i_s(z,t) = C_m' \\frac{\\partial v_1(z,t)}{\\partial t} = C_m' v_f'(t - z/v)$, where $v_f'$ denotes the derivative with respect to the argument. A small current element $di_s = i_s(z',t) dz'$ injected at position $z'$ splits into two voltage waves traveling in opposite directions:\n- Backward-traveling wave (towards $z=0$): $dv_{bwd} = \\frac{1}{2} di_s Z_0$\n- Forward-traveling wave (towards $z=\\ell$): $dv_{fwd} = \\frac{1}{2} di_s Z_0$\n\n**Near-End Crosstalk (NECT) Voltage, $V_{NE}(t)$:**\nThe NECT voltage at $z=0$ is the superposition of all backward-traveling waves. A wave generated at $z'$ at time $t'$ arrives at $z=0$ at time $t = t' + z'/v$. Thus, we must evaluate the source at time $t' = t - z'/v$.\n$$ V_{NE}(t) = \\int_0^{\\ell} \\frac{1}{2} Z_0 i_s(z', t - z'/v) dz' = \\int_0^{\\ell} \\frac{1}{2} Z_0 C_m' v_f'((t - z'/v) - z'/v) dz' $$\n$$ V_{NE}(t) = \\int_0^{\\ell} \\frac{1}{2} Z_0 C_m' v_f'(t - 2z'/v) dz' $$\nLet $u = t - 2z'/v$. Then $dz' = -v/2 du$. The limits of integration become $u=t$ for $z'=0$ and $u=t-2\\ell/v = t-2\\tau$ for $z'=\\ell$.\n$$ V_{NE}(t) = \\frac{Z_0 C_m'}{2} \\int_{t}^{t-2\\tau} v_f'(u) \\left(-\\frac{v}{2} du\\right) = \\frac{Z_0 C_m' v}{4} \\int_{t-2\\tau}^{t} v_f'(u) du $$\n$$ V_{NE}(t) = \\frac{Z_0 C_m' v}{4} [v_f(t) - v_f(t - 2\\tau)] $$\n\n**Far-End Crosstalk (FECT) Voltage, $V_{FE}(t)$:**\nThe FECT voltage at $z=\\ell$ is the superposition of all forward-traveling waves. A wave generated at $z'$ at time $t'$ arrives at $z=\\ell$ at time $t = t' + (\\ell-z')/v$. The argument of the source term $v_f'(t' - z'/v)$ becomes:\n$$ v_f'((t - (\\ell-z')/v) - z'/v) = v_f'(t - \\ell/v + z'/v - z'/v) = v_f'(t - \\tau) $$\nThe argument is independent of $z'$, so the integrand is constant.\n$$ V_{FE}(t) = \\int_0^{\\ell} \\frac{1}{2} Z_0 C_m' v_f'(t - \\tau) dz' = \\frac{Z_0 C_m' \\ell}{2} v_f'(t - \\tau) $$\n\n**Part 2: Peak NECT Amplitudes (TL and RC models)**\n\nFirst, we calculate the relevant propagation characteristics:\n- $Z_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{L'}{C'}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{250 \\times 10^{-9}}{100 \\times 10^{-12}}} = \\sqrt{2500} = 50 \\ \\Omega$\n- $v = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{L'C'}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(250 \\times 10^{-9})(100 \\times 10^{-12})}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{25 \\times 10^{-18}}} = 2.0 \\times 10^8 \\ \\text{m/s}$\n- $\\tau = \\frac{\\ell}{v} = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{-2}}{2.0 \\times 10^8} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\text{s}$\n\nThe aggressor forward wave $v_f(t) = v_s(t)/2$ is:\n- $v_f(t) = \\frac{V_0}{2t_r} t$ for $0 \\leq t \\leq t_r$\n- $v_f(t) = \\frac{V_0}{2}$ for $t  t_r$\n\nThe given rise time is $t_r = 5.0 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\text{s}$. We note that $t_r = 2\\tau$. This is a critical condition for determining the pulse shape.\n\n**Peak NECT from Transmission Line (TL) Model:**\nThe NECT waveform is $V_{NE}(t) = K_{NE} [v_f(t) - v_f(t - 2\\tau)]$, where $K_{NE} = \\frac{Z_0 C_m' v}{4}$.\nSince $t_r = 2\\tau$, we analyze the waveform:\n- For $0 \\leq t  2\\tau$: $v_f(t-2\\tau) = 0$. Thus, $V_{NE}(t) = K_{NE} v_f(t) = K_{NE} \\frac{V_0}{2t_r} t$. The voltage ramps up.\n- At $t=2\\tau=t_r$, the aggressor ramp $v_f(t)$ reaches its final value, and the term $v_f(t-2\\tau)$ just begins to rise from zero. The voltage $V_{NE}(t)$ reaches its peak at this instant.\n- For $t > 2\\tau=t_r$, $v_f(t)$ has saturated to $V_0/2$, while $v_f(t-2\\tau)$ is ramping up. The difference, and thus $V_{NE}(t)$, decreases.\n\nThe peak amplitude is reached at $t = 2\\tau = t_r$:\n$$ V_{\\text{NE,TL,peak}} = K_{NE} \\frac{V_0}{2} = \\left(\\frac{Z_0 C_m' v}{4}\\right) \\frac{V_0}{2} = \\frac{Z_0 C_m' v V_0}{8} $$\nNumerically:\n$$ V_{\\text{NE,TL,peak}} = \\frac{(50) \\cdot (5 \\times 10^{-12}) \\cdot (2 \\times 10^8) \\cdot (1.0)}{8} = \\frac{50 \\times 10^{-4}}{8} = 6.25 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\text{V} $$\n\n**Peak NECT from Lumped Resistive-Capacitive (RC) Model:**\nThe problem specifies modeling the coupling as a single capacitor $C_m = C_m' \\ell$ injecting a current into the near-end termination $Z_0$. The current is driven by the change in the aggressor's near-end voltage, $v_1(0,t) = v_f(t)$.\nThe injected current is $i_{RC}(t) = C_m \\frac{d v_f(t)}{dt}$.\nThe resulting voltage is $V_{\\text{NE,RC}}(t) = i_{RC}(t) \\cdot Z_0 = (C_m' \\ell) Z_0 \\frac{d v_f(t)}{dt}$.\n\nDuring the ramp, for $0  t  t_r$, the derivative is constant:\n$$ \\frac{d v_f(t)}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left(\\frac{V_0}{2t_r}t\\right) = \\frac{V_0}{2t_r} $$\nThe RC model predicts a rectangular voltage pulse of duration $t_r$ and amplitude:\n$$ V_{\\text{NE,RC,peak}} = \\frac{C_m' \\ell Z_0 V_0}{2t_r} $$\nNumerically:\n$$ V_{\\text{NE,RC,peak}} = \\frac{(5 \\times 10^{-12}) \\cdot (5.0 \\times 10^{-2}) \\cdot (50) \\cdot (1.0)}{2 \\cdot (5.0 \\times 10^{-10})} = \\frac{1.25 \\times 10^{-11}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-9}} = 1.25 \\times 10^{-2} \\ \\text{V} $$\n\n**Part 3: Ratio of Peak Amplitudes**\n\nWe compute the ratio $R = \\frac{V_{\\text{NE,TL,peak}}}{V_{\\text{NE,RC,peak}}}$.\nAnalytically:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\frac{Z_0 C_m' v V_0}{8}}{\\frac{C_m' \\ell Z_0 V_0}{2t_r}} = \\frac{Z_0 C_m' v V_0}{8} \\cdot \\frac{2t_r}{C_m' \\ell Z_0 V_0} = \\frac{2vt_r}{8\\ell} = \\frac{vt_r}{4\\ell} $$\nUsing the relation $\\ell = v\\tau$, this simplifies to:\n$$ R = \\frac{vt_r}{4v\\tau} = \\frac{t_r}{4\\tau} $$\nFor the specific case given, $t_r = 2\\tau$:\n$$ R = \\frac{2\\tau}{4\\tau} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 $$\nUsing the calculated numerical peak values:\n$$ R = \\frac{6.25 \\times 10^{-3}}{1.25 \\times 10^{-2}} = \\frac{0.00625}{0.0125} = 0.5 $$\nThe problem asks for the ratio to be expressed as a decimal number rounded to four significant figures.\n\n$$ R = 0.5000 $$",
