The carrier velocity is given by the velocity saturation model: $v = \\frac{\\mu E}{1 + \\mu E / v_{\\mathrm{sat}}}$. The average longitudinal electric field is approximated as $E \\approx V_{\\mathrm{ov}} / L$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the current equation:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{on}} = W (C_{\\mathrm{ox}} V_{\\mathrm{ov}}) \\left( \\frac{\\mu (V_{\\mathrm{ov}}/L)}{1 + \\mu (V_{\\mathrm{ov}}/L) / v_{\\mathrm{sat}}} \\right)$$\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{on}} = \\frac{W}{L} C_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\mu V_{\\mathrm{ov}}^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{\\mu V_{\\mathrm{ov}}}{L v_{\\mathrm{sat}}}} \\right)$$\nTo simplify the analysis, let's define a dimensionless saturation parameter $\\alpha \\equiv \\frac{\\mu V_{\\mathrm{ov}}}{L v_{\\mathrm{sat}}}$. The on-current expression becomes:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{on}} = \\frac{W}{L} C_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\mu V_{\\mathrm{ov}}^2 \\frac{1}{1+\\alpha}$$\nNow we can write the ratio $\\mathcal{R}$ for the modified device (subscript $1$) relative to the reference device (subscript $0$):\n$$\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{on},1}}{I_{\\mathrm{on},0}} = \\frac{\\frac{W}{L} C_{\\mathrm{ox},1} \\mu_1 V_{\\mathrm{ov},1}^2 \\frac{1}{1+\\alpha_1}}{\\frac{W}{L} C_{\\mathrm{ox},0} \\mu_0 V_{\\mathrm{ov},0}^2 \\frac{1}{1+\\alpha_0}} = \\left(\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{ox},1}}{C_{\\mathrm{ox},0}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\mu_1}{\\mu_0}\\right) \\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{ov},1}}{V_{\\mathrm{ov},0}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{1+\\alpha_0}{1+\\alpha_1}\\right)$$\nWe will now calculate each term in this ratio.\n\n**Component Ratios:**\n1.  **Capacitance Ratio**: $C_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\propto 1/\\mathrm{EOT}$.\n    $$\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{ox},1}}{C_{\\mathrm{ox},0}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{EOT}_0}{\\mathrm{EOT}_1} = \\frac{1.1\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{0.8\\,\\mathrm{nm}} = 1.375$$\n2.  **Mobility Ratio**: Given directly as the enhancement factor $\\eta_\\mu$.\n    $$\\frac{\\mu_1}{\\mu_0} = \\eta_\\mu = 1.6$$\n3.  **Overdrive Voltage Ratio**:\n    $V_{\\mathrm{ov},0} = V_{DD} - V_{T0} = 0.80\\,\\mathrm{V} - 0.35\\,\\mathrm{V} = 0.45\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n    $V_{\\mathrm{ov},1} = V_{DD} - V_{T1} = 0.80\\,\\mathrm{V} - 0.30\\,\\mathrm{V} = 0.50\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n    $$\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{ov},1}}{V_{\\mathrm{ov},0}} = \\frac{0.50\\,\\mathrm{V}}{0.45\\,\\mathrm{V}} = \\frac{10}{9} \\approx 1.111...$$\n    $$\\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{ov},1}}{V_{\\mathrm{ov},0}}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{10}{9}\\right)^2 = \\frac{100}{81} \\approx 1.2345...$$\n\n**Saturation Correction Factor:**\nFirst, we calculate the saturation parameters $\\alpha_0$ and $\\alpha_1$.
