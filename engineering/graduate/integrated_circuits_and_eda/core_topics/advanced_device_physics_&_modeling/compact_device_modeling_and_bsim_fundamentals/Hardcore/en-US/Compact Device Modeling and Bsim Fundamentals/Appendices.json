Validation and Verdict:**\nThe problem is a standard exercise in semiconductor device physics, forming the basis for models like BSIM. All provided data are physically realistic, and the assumptions and governing equations are fundamental to the field. The problem is self-contained, unambiguous, and solvable. The provided oxide thickness $t_{ox}$ is not required for the requested calculations but does not create a contradiction. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested: first, the derivation and calculation of the surface potential at threshold, $\\psi_{s,\\text{th}}$, and second, the derivation and calculation of the corresponding maximum depletion width, $W_{d,\\text{th}}$.\n\n**Part 1: Surface Potential at Threshold ($\\psi_{s,\\text{th}}$)**\n\nThe potential in the semiconductor is defined relative to the bulk, where the potential is zero. In the neutral $p$-type bulk, the hole concentration $p_{p0}$ is equal to the acceptor concentration $N_{A}$, assuming full ionization. The electron concentration $n_{p0}$ is given by the mass-action law, $n_{p0} = n_{i}^{2} / p_{p0} = n_{i}^{2} / N_{A}$.\n\nThe Fermi potential, $\\phi_{F}$, measures the position of the bulk Fermi level $E_{F}$ relative to the intrinsic Fermi level $E_{i}$, and is defined by the relation $q\\phi_F = E_i - E_F$. For a $p$-type semiconductor where the hole concentration $p_{p0} = N_A$, the concentration is related to the intrinsic level by:\n$$p_{p0} = N_A = n_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_i - E_F}{k_B T}\\right) = n_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{q \\phi_F}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nSolving for $\\phi_F$:\n$$\\phi_F = \\frac{k_B T}{q} \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_{A}}{n_{i}}\\right)$$\nThe term $\\frac{k_B T}{q}$ is the thermal voltage, denoted as $U_T$ to distinguish it from the threshold voltage.\nThe electron and hole concentrations at any point $x$ in the semiconductor, where the potential is $\\psi(x)$, are given by Boltzmann statistics for a nondegenerate semiconductor:\n$$p(x) = p_{p0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{q \\psi(x)}{k_B T}\\right) = N_A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\psi(x)}{U_T}\\right)$$\n$$n(x) = n_{p0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{q \\psi(x)}{k_B T}\\right) = \\frac{n_i^2}{N_A} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\psi(x)}{U_T}\\right)$$\nThe threshold for strong inversion is defined as the condition where the minority carrier concentration at the surface (electrons, in this case) becomes equal to the majority carrier concentration in the bulk (holes). At the surface ($x=0$), the potential is the surface potential, $\\psi_s$. The threshold condition is thus:\n$$n(x=0) = n_s = N_A$$\nSubstituting this into the equation for $n(x)$ at the surface, where $\\psi(0) = \\psi_{s,\\text{th}}$:\n$$N_A = \\frac{n_i^2}{N_A} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\psi_{s,\\text{th}}}{U_T}\\right)$$\nRearranging to solve for $\\psi_{s,\\text{th}}$:\n$$\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\psi_{s,\\text{th}}}{U_T}\\right) = \\frac{N_A^2}{n_i^2}$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\frac{\\psi_{s,\\text{th}}}{U_T} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A^2}{n_i^2}\\right) = 2 \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A}{n_i}\\right)$$\n$$\\psi_{s,\\text{th}} = 2 U_T \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A}{n_i}\\right) = 2 \\frac{k_B T}{q} \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A}{n_i}\\right)$$\nThis shows that the surface potential required for strong inversion is twice the bulk Fermi potential, $\\psi_{s,\\text{th}} = 2 \\phi_F$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value.\nThe thermal voltage $U_T$ is:\n$$U_T = \\frac{k_B T}{q} = \\frac{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\text{J/K}) (300\\ \\text{K})}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\text{C}} \\approx 0.025855\\ \\text{V}$$\nThe ratio of concentrations is:\n$$\\frac{N_A}{n_i} = \\frac{7.5 \\times 10^{16}\\ \\text{cm}^{-3}}{1.0 \\times 10^{10}\\ \\text{cm}^{-3}} = 7.5 \\times 10^6$$\nThe surface potential at threshold is:\n$$\\psi_{s,\\text{th}} = 2 \\times (0.025855\\ \\text{V}) \\times \\ln(7.5 \\times 10^6) \\approx 2 \\times (0.025855\\ \\text{V}) \\times (15.8303) \\approx 0.81840\\ \\text{V}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\psi_{s,\\text{th}} = 0.8184\\ \\text{V}$.\n\n**Part 2: Maximum Depletion Width at Threshold ($W_{d,\\text{th}}$)**\n\nWe use the depletion approximation, where for $0 \\le x \\le W_d$, the charge density $\\rho(x)$ is due only to the ionized acceptors, $\\rho(x) = -q N_A$. Poisson's equation becomes:\n$$\\frac{d^2 \\psi}{dx^2} = - \\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\varepsilon_{\\text{si}}} = \\frac{q N_A}{\\varepsilon_{\\text{si}}}$$\nwhere $\\varepsilon_{\\text{si}} = \\varepsilon_{\\text{si},r} \\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of silicon. We integrate this equation twice with appropriate boundary conditions. The coordinate system is defined with $x=0$ at the silicon-oxide interface and $x$ pointing into the silicon.\n\nFirst integration yields the electric field, $\\mathcal{E}(x) = - \\frac{d\\psi}{dx}$:\n$$\\frac{d\\psi}{dx} = \\int \\frac{q N_A}{\\varepsilon_{\\text{si}}} dx = \\frac{q N_A}{\\varepsilon_{\\text{si}}} x + C_1$$\nThe electric field must be zero at the edge of the depletion region, $x=W_d$. Thus, $\\mathcal{E}(W_d) = -(\\frac{d\\psi}{dx})_{x=W_d} = 0$.\n$$0 = -\\left(\\frac{q N_A}{\\varepsilon_{\\text{si}}} W_d + C_1 \\right) \\implies C_1 = -\\frac{q N_A W_d}{\\varepsilon_{\\text{si}}}$$\nSo, the electric field is $\\mathcal{E}(x) = -\\frac{d\\psi}{dx} = \\frac{qN_A}{\\varepsilon_{\\text{si}}}(W_d - x)$.\n\nSecond integration yields the potential, $\\psi(x)$:\n$$\\psi(x) = \\int -\\mathcal{E}(x) dx = \\int -\\frac{q N_A}{\\varepsilon_{\\text{si}}} (W_d - x) dx = -\\frac{q N_A}{\\varepsilon_{\\text{si}}} \\left(W_d x - \\frac{x^2}{2}\\right) + C_2$$\nThe potential at the edge of the depletion region is our reference potential, $\\psi(W_d) = 0$.\n$$0 = -\\frac{q N_A}{\\varepsilon_{\\text{si}}} \\left(W_d^2 - \\frac{W_d^2}{2}\\right) + C_2 \\implies C_2 = \\frac{q N_A W_d^2}{2 \\varepsilon_{\\text{si}}}$$\nThe potential profile is:\n$$\\psi(x) = \\frac{q N_A}{2 \\varepsilon_{\\text{si}}} (W_d^2 - 2W_d x + x^2) = \\frac{q N_A}{2 \\varepsilon_{\\text{si}}} (W_d - x)^2$$\nThe surface potential $\\psi_s$ is the potential at $x=0$:\n$$\\psi_s = \\psi(0) = \\frac{q N_A W_d^2}{2 \\varepsilon_{\\text{si}}}$$\nSolving for the depletion width $W_d$:\n$$W_d = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\varepsilon_{\\text{si}} \\psi_s}{q N_A}}$$\nAt the threshold of strong inversion, the surface potential is $\\psi_s = \\psi_{s,\\text{th}}$, and the depletion width reaches its maximum value, $W_{d,\\text{th}}$ (further increases in gate voltage primarily increase the inversion charge, not the depletion width).\n$$W_{d,\\text{th}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\varepsilon_{\\text{si}} \\psi_{s,\\text{th}}}{q N_A}}$$\nTo compute the numerical value, all quantities must be in SI units.\nFirst, we calculate $\\varepsilon_{\\text{si}}$:\n$$\\varepsilon_{\\text{si}} = \\varepsilon_{\\text{si},r} \\varepsilon_0 = 11.7 \\times (8.854 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\text{F/m}) \\approx 1.0359 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\text{F/m}$$\nNext, we convert $N_A$ from $\\text{cm}^{-3}$ to $\\text{m}^{-3}$.

The problem does not violate any fundamental principles and is a core exercise in microelectronic device physics.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe drain current $I_{D}$ in a MOSFET is due to the drift of charge carriers in the channel. Let the channel extend along the $x$-axis, from the source at $x=0$ to the drain at $x=L$. The drift current at any point $x$ is given by the product of the channel width $W$, the mobile charge density per unit area in the inversion layer $Q_{n}(x)$, and the drift velocity of the carriers $v(x)$. Since the current must be continuous along the channel (Kirchhoff's Current Law), $I_D$ is constant with respect to $x$.\n$$I_{D} = -W Q_{n}(x) v(x)$$\nThe negative sign accounts for the negative charge of electrons. The drift velocity $v(x)$ is related to the electric field $E(x)$ along the channel by the constant mobility $\\mu$: $v(x) = -\\mu E(x)$. The electric field is the negative gradient of the channel potential $V(x)$, so $E(x) = -\\frac{dV(x)}{dx}$.\nCombining these gives:\n$$I_{D} = -W Q_{n}(x) \\left(-\\mu \\left(-\\frac{dV(x)}{dx}\\right)\\right) = -W \\mu Q_{n}(x) \\frac{dV(x)}{dx}$$\nUnder the charge-sheet approximation in strong inversion, the mobile electron charge density per unit area $Q_{n}(x)$ is given by:\n$$Q_{n}(x) = -C_{\\mathrm{ox}} (V_{GC}(x) - V_{T0})$$\nwhere $V_{GC}(x) = V_{G} - V(x)$ is the gate-to-channel voltage at position $x$. We assume the source is grounded, so $V_{S}=0$ and all potentials are with respect to the source.\n$$Q_{n}(x) = -C_{\\mathrm{ox}} (V_{G} - V(x) - V_{T0}) = -C_{\\mathrm{ox}} (V_{GT} - V(x))$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $I_{D}$:\n$$I_{D} = -W \\mu [-C_{\\mathrm{ox}}(V_{GT} - V(x))] \\frac{dV(x)}{dx} = W \\mu C_{\\mathrm{ox}} (V_{GT} - V(x)) \\frac{dV(x)}{dx}$$\nTo find the total current, we integrate along the length of the channel. We rearrange the equation to separate variables:\n$$I_{D} \\, dx = W \\mu C_{\\mathrm{ox}} (V_{GT} - V(x)) \\, dV$$\nWe integrate from the source ($x=0$, $V(0)=0$) to the drain ($x=L$, $V(L)=V_{D}$):\n$$\\int_{0}^{L} I_{D} \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{V_{D}} W \\mu C_{\\mathrm{ox}} (V_{GT} - V) \\, dV$$\nSince $I_{D}$ is constant with respect to $x$:\n$$I_{D} [x]_{0}^{L} = W \\mu C_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\left[ V_{GT}V - \\frac{1}{2}V^2 \\right]_{0}^{V_{D}}$$\n$$I_{D} L = W \\mu C_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\left( V_{GT}V_{D} - \\frac{1}{2}V_{D}^2 \\right)$$\nUsing the definition $\\beta \\equiv \\mu C_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\frac{W}{L}$, we obtain the drain current in the linear (or triode) region:\n$$I_{D} = \\beta \\left( V_{GT}V_{D} - \\frac{1}{2}V_{D}^2 \\right)$$\nThis equation is valid as long as an inversion channel exists along the entire path from source to drain. The channel is said to be \"pinched off\" at the drain end when the potential difference between the gate and the drain is equal to the threshold voltage, i.e., $V_{GD} = V_{T0}$. This corresponds to $V_{G} - V_{D} = V_{T0}$, or $V_{D} = V_{G} - V_{T0} \\equiv V_{GT}$. This voltage is defined as the saturation drain voltage, $V_{D,\\mathrm{sat}} = V_{GT}$. Thus, the linear region expression is valid for $0 \\le V_{D} < V_{D,\\mathrm{sat}}$.\n\nFor $V_{D} \\ge V_{D,\\mathrm{sat}}$, the channel is pinched off at the drain. In the simple long-channel model with the assumption of no channel-length modulation, the current ceases to depend on $V_{D}$ and saturates at the value obtained by setting $V_{D} = V_{D,\\mathrm{sat}} = V_{GT}$ in the linear region equation:\n$$I_{D,\\mathrm{sat}} = \\beta \\left( V_{GT}(V_{GT}) - \\frac{1}{2}(V_{GT})^2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\beta V_{GT}^2$$\nThis is the current in the saturation region.\n\nThe complete piecewise model for the drain current is:\n$$\nI_{D}(V_{G}, V_{D}) = \\begin{cases} \\beta \\left( V_{GT}V_{D} - \\frac{1}{2}V_{D}^2 \\right) & \\text{for } 0 \\le V_{D} < V_{GT} \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}\\beta V_{GT}^2 & \\text{for } V_{D} \\ge V_{GT} \\end{cases}\n$$\nwhere $V_{GT} = V_{G} - V_{T0}$.\n\nNext, we compute the required partial derivatives.\nIn the linear region ($0 \\le V_{D} < V_{GT}$):\nThe transconductance, $g_{m}$, is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial I_{D}}{\\partial V_{G}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_{G}} \\left[ \\beta \\left( (V_{G}-V_{T0})V_{D} - \\frac{1}{2}V_{D}^2 \\right) \\right] = \\beta V_{D} $$\nThe output conductance, $g_{d}$, is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial I_{D}}{\\partial V_{D}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_{D}} \\left[ \\beta \\left( V_{GT}V_{D} - \\frac{1}{2}V_{D}^2 \\right) \\right] = \\beta (V_{GT} - V_{D}) $$\n\nIn the saturation region ($V_{D} \\ge V_{GT}$):\nThe transconductance, $g_{m}$, is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial I_{D}}{\\partial V_{G}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_{G}} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}\\beta (V_{G}-V_{T0})^2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{2}\\beta \\cdot 2(V_{G}-V_{T0}) \\cdot 1 = \\beta(V_{G}-V_{T0}) = \\beta V_{GT} $$\nThe output conductance, $g_{d}$, is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial I_{D}}{\\partial V_{D}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_{D}} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}\\beta V_{GT}^2 \\right] = 0 $$\nThe result is $0$ because $I_{D}$ in this ideal saturation model is independent of $V_{D}$ (no channel-length modulation).\n\nNow, we evaluate the one-sided limits of the output conductance $\\frac{\\partial I_{D}}{\\partial V_{D}}$ as $V_{D}$ approaches the saturation boundary $V_{D,\\mathrm{sat}} = V_{GT}$.\nThe limit from below (from the linear region):\n$$ \\lim_{V_{D} \\to V_{D,\\mathrm{sat}}^{-}} \\frac{\\partial I_{D}}{\\partial V_{D}} = \\lim_{V_{D} \\to V_{GT}^{-}} \\left[ \\beta (V_{GT} - V_{D}) \\right] = \\beta (V_{GT} - V_{GT}) = 0 $$\nThe limit from above (from the saturation region):\n$$ \\lim_{V_{D} \\to V_{D,\\mathrm{sat}}^{+}} \\frac{\\partial I_{D}}{\\partial V_{D}} = \\lim_{V_{D} \\to V_{GT}^{+}} [0] = 0 $$\n\nFinally, we compute the discontinuity measure $\\Delta_{D}$:\n$$\n\\Delta_{D} \\equiv \\lim_{V_{D} \\to V_{D,\\mathrm{sat}}^{-}} \\frac{\\partial I_{D}}{\\partial V_{D}} \\;-\\; \\lim_{V_{D} \\to V_{D,\\mathrm{sat}}^{+}} \\frac{\\partial I_{D}}{\\partial V_{D}}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta_{D} = 0 - 0 = 0\n$$\nThe discontinuity in the output conductance at the linear-saturation boundary is zero for this idealized long-channel model.

            "introduction": "Modern, high-fidelity compact models like BSIM are \"charge-based\" to guarantee the conservation of charge, a principle essential for accurate dynamic and transient circuit simulations. This practice introduces the charge-based modeling paradigm by tasking you with the derivation of the charges stored at the device terminals. From these charges, you will compute the intrinsic gate-source ($C_{gs}$) and gate-drain ($C_{gd}$) capacitances and verify the principle of reciprocity, a fundamental check for a physically consistent and accurate capacitance model .",

            "problem": "Consider a long-channel Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) whose intrinsic capacitances are to be computed using the charge-based approach foundational to the Berkeley Short-channel Insulated-Gate Field-Effect Transistor (BSIM) model. Assume quasi-static operation in strong inversion, no velocity saturation, and neglect overlap and fringing capacitances. The device has channel length $L$, width $W$, and gate-oxide capacitance per unit area $C_{ox}$. The source is at potential $V_{s}$, the drain is at potential $V_{d}$, and the gate is at potential $V_{g}$, with threshold voltage $V_{th}$.

Provide numerical values for $C_{gs}$ and $C_{gd}$ in Farads, rounded to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded and Objective**: The problem is a standard exercise in introductory semiconductor device physics and compact modeling. It is based on established electrostatic principles and the widely used charge-based modeling approach (e.g., Ward-Dutton partitioning, a precursor to BSIM models). The language is precise and objective.\n- **Well-Posed and Self-Contained**: The problem provides all necessary parameters ($L, W, C_{ox}, V_{th}$), bias conditions ($V_g, V_d, V_s$), and a clear set of simplifying assumptions (linear potential profile, etc.) to derive a unique solution. The condition for linear region operation ($V_g - V_{th} > V_d - V_s$) is explicitly given and can be verified with the provided values: $0.9\\,\\text{V} - 0.3\\,\\text{V} = 0.6\\,\\text{V}$ and $0.2\\,\\text{V} - 0\\,\\text{V} = 0.2\\,\\text{V}$.

The requested task—calculating capacitances and verifying reciprocity—is a standard procedure in this field and does not contain internal contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe solution proceeds by first deriving the terminal charges ($Q_g$, $Q_d$, $Q_s$) based on the given physical model and then calculating the capacitances as their partial derivatives.\n\n**1. Channel Charge and Potential**\nIn strong inversion, the inversion sheet charge density (charge per unit area) at a position $x$ along the channel is given by:\n$$q'_{inv}(x) = -C_{ox} (V_{gc}(x) - V_{th})$$\nwhere $V_{gc}(x) = V_g - V(x)$ is the local gate-to-channel voltage.\nThe problem states to assume the channel potential $V(x)$ varies linearly from the source (at $x=0$) to the drain (at $x=L$):\n$$V(x) = V_s + (V_d - V_s) \\frac{x}{L}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $q'_{inv}(x)$:\n$$q'_{inv}(x) = -C_{ox} \\left( V_g - V_s - (V_d - V_s)\\frac{x}{L} - V_{th} \\right)$$\nLet $V_{gs} = V_g - V_s$ and $V_{ds} = V_d - V_s$.\n$$q'_{inv}(x) = -C_{ox} \\left( V_{gs} - V_{th} - V_{ds}\\frac{x}{L} \\right)$$\n\n**2. Terminal Charge Calculation**\nThe total gate charge, $Q_g$, under the assumption that it is the negative of the total channel inversion charge ($Q_g = -Q_{inv}$), is found by integrating $q'_{inv}(x)$ over the channel area:\n$$Q_g = - \\int_0^L W q'_{inv}(x) dx = W C_{ox} \\int_0^L \\left( V_{gs} - V_{th} - V_{ds}\\frac{x}{L} \\right) dx$$\n$$Q_g = W C_{ox} \\left[ (V_{gs} - V_{th})x - \\frac{V_{ds}}{2L}x^2 \\right]_0^L$$\n$$Q_g = W C_{ox} L \\left( V_{gs} - V_{th} - \\frac{V_{ds}}{2} \\right)$$\nLet the total oxide capacitance be $C_{ox,tot} = W L C_{ox}$. Expressing $Q_g$ in terms of the independent terminal voltages $V_g$, $V_s$, and $V_d$:\n$$Q_g = C_{ox,tot} \\left( (V_g - V_s) - V_{th} - \\frac{V_d - V_s}{2} \\right) = C_{ox,tot} \\left( V_g - \\frac{V_s}{2} - \\frac{V_d}{2} - V_{th} \\right)$$\n\nThe drain charge $Q_d$ and source charge $Q_s$ are derived using Ward-Dutton linear partitioning:\n$$Q_d = \\int_0^L W q'_{inv}(x) \\frac{x}{L} dx = -\\frac{W C_{ox}}{L} \\int_0^L \\left( V_{gs} - V_{th} - V_{ds}\\frac{x}{L} \\right)x dx$$\n$$Q_d = -\\frac{C_{ox,tot}}{L^2} \\left[ (V_{gs} - V_{th})\\frac{x^2}{2} - \\frac{V_{ds}}{L}\\frac{x^3}{3} \\right]_0^L = -C_{ox,tot} \\left( \\frac{V_{gs} - V_{th}}{2} - \\frac{V_{ds}}{3} \\right)$$\nIn terms of terminal voltages:\n$$Q_d = -C_{ox,tot} \\left( \\frac{V_g - V_s - V_{th}}{2} - \\frac{V_d - V_s}{3} \\right) = -C_{ox,tot} \\left( \\frac{V_g}{2} - \\frac{V_d}{3} - \\frac{V_s}{6} - \\frac{V_{th}}{2} \\right)$$\n\nThe source charge is $Q_s = Q_{inv} - Q_d = -Q_g - Q_d$. Alternatively, using the partitioning integral:\n$$Q_s = \\int_0^L W q'_{inv}(x) \\left(1-\\frac{x}{L}\\right) dx = -C_{ox,tot} \\left( \\frac{V_{gs} - V_{th}}{2} - \\frac{V_{ds}}{6} \\right)$$\nIn terms of terminal voltages:\n$$Q_s = -C_{ox,tot} \\left( \\frac{V_g - V_s - V_{th}}{2} - \\frac{V_d - V_s}{6} \\right) = -C_{ox,tot} \\left( \\frac{V_g}{2} - \\frac{V_d}{6} - \\frac{V_s}{3} - \\frac{V_{th}}{2} \\right)$$\n\n**3. Capacitance Calculation**\nThe problem asks to compute $C_{gs}$ and $C_{gd}$, which, following the definition $C_{ij} = \\partial Q_i / \\partial V_j$, correspond to $C_{g,s} = \\partial Q_g / \\partial V_s$ and $C_{g,d} = \\partial Q_g / \\partial V_d$.\nUsing the expression for $Q_g(V_g, V_s, V_d)$:\n$$C_{gs} = \\frac{\\partial Q_g}{\\partial V_s} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_s} \\left[ C_{ox,tot} \\left( V_g - \\frac{V_s}{2} - \\frac{V_d}{2} - V_{th} \\right) \\right] = -\\frac{1}{2} C_{ox,tot}$$\n$$C_{gd} = \\frac{\\partial Q_g}{\\partial V_d} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_d} \\left[ C_{ox,tot} \\left( V_g - \\frac{V_s}{2} - \\frac{V_d}{2} - V_{th} \\right) \\right] = -\\frac{1}{2} C_{ox,tot}$$\n\n**4. Reciprocity Verification**\nThe problem requires verification that $C_{gd} = \\partial Q_d/\\partial V_g$ and $C_{gs} = \\partial Q_s/\\partial V_g$. These are the reciprocity relations $C_{gd} = C_{dg}$ and $C_{gs} = C_{sg}$. Let's compute $C_{dg}$ and $C_{sg}$:\nFrom the expression $Q_d(V_g, V_s, V_d)$:\n$$C_{dg} = \\frac{\\partial Q_d}{\\partial V_g} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_g} \\left[ -C_{ox,tot} \\left( \\frac{V_g}{2} - \\frac{V_d}{3} - \\frac{V_s}{6} - \\frac{V_{th}}{2} \\right) \\right] = -\\frac{1}{2} C_{ox,tot}$$\nComparing this with $C_{gd}$, we find $C_{gd} = C_{dg} = - C_{ox,tot} / 2$. Reciprocity is verified for the gate-drain element.\n\nFrom the expression $Q_s(V_g, V_s, V_d)$:\n$$C_{sg} = \\frac{\\partial Q_s}{\\partial V_g} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_g} \\left[ -C_{ox,tot} \\left( \\frac{V_g}{2} - \\frac{V_d}{6} - \\frac{V_s}{3} - \\frac{V_{th}}{2} \\right) \\right] = -\\frac{1}{2} C_{ox,tot}$$\nComparing this with $C_{gs}$, we find $C_{gs} = C_{sg} = - C_{ox,tot} / 2$. Reciprocity is verified for the gate-source element.\n\n**5. Numerical Evaluation**\nFirst, we calculate the total gate oxide capacitance $C_{ox,tot}$:\n$$C_{ox,tot} = W L C_{ox} = (1.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{m}) (1.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{m}) (1.6 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\text{F/m}^{2})$$\n$$C_{ox,tot} = (1.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{m}^2) (1.6 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\text{F/m}^{2}) = 1.6 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\text{F}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical values for $C_{gs}$ and $C_{gd}$:\n$$C_{gs} = -\\frac{1}{2} C_{ox,tot} = -\\frac{1}{2} (1.6 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\text{F}) = -0.8 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\text{F} = -8.0 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\text{F}$$\n$$C_{gd} = -\\frac{1}{2} C_{ox,tot} = -\\frac{1}{2} (1.6 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\text{F}) = -8.0 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\text{F}$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested:\n$$C_{gs} = -8.000 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\text{F}$$\n$$C_{gd} = -8.000 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\text{F}$$\nThe equality of $C_{gs}$ and $C_{gd}$ is a direct result of the simplifying assumption of a linear potential profile in the channel, which makes the gate charge expression symmetric with respect to source and drain potentials.",
