            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and evaluation of the electrostatic scaling length, $\\lambda$, for an ultra-thin-body single-gate MOSFET.\n\nThe starting point is the two-dimensional Laplace equation for the incremental electrostatic potential, $\\tilde{\\phi}(x,y)$, in the charge-free silicon film:\n$$ \\nabla^2 \\tilde{\\phi} = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\tilde{\\phi}}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\tilde{\\phi}}{\\partial y^2} = 0 $$\nThe coordinate system is defined with $x$ along the channel and $y$ perpendicular to it, with the Si/SiO$_2$ interface at $y=0$ and the back of the silicon film at $y=t_{si}$.\n\nWe use the method of separation of variables, assuming a solution of the form $\\tilde{\\phi}(x,y) = X(x)Y(y)$. Substituting this into the Laplace equation and separating the variables yields:\n$$ \\frac{1}{X(x)}\\frac{d^2 X}{dx^2} = -\\frac{1}{Y(y)}\\fracd^2 Y}{dy^2} $$\nSince the left side is a function of $x$ only and the right side is a function of $y$ only, both must be equal to a constant. The problem states that the potential decays exponentially along the channel as $\\exp(-x/\\lambda)$, which implies that $\\frac{d^2 X}{dx^2} = (1/\\lambda^2) X$. We therefore set the separation constant to $k^2 = 1/\\lambda^2$, where $k$ is the wavenumber.\n\nThe equation for $X(x)$ is $\\frac{d^2 X}{dx^2} = k^2 X$, with a solution of the form $X(x) = A\\exp(-kx) + B\\exp(kx)$. For a potential perturbation decaying away from a source (e.g., at $x=0$) into the channel ($x>0$), we choose the decaying solution, so $X(x) \\propto \\exp(-kx)$.

This value is not small compared to $1$, indicating that the approximation $\\tan(t_{si}/\\lambda) \\approx t_{si}/\\lambda$ is not accurate for these specific parameters. The transcendental equation should be solved numerically for a precise result. However, the problem asks for a derivation based on an analytic approximation, for which the derived formula is the standard result.\n\nFinally, we are asked to interpret the gate control for a channel length $L=16\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. The ratio $L/\\lambda$ is a measure of the gate's control over the channel potential relative to the influence of the source and drain.\n$$ \\frac{L}{\\lambda} \\approx \\frac{16\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{7.75\\,\\mathrm{nm}} \\approx 2.06 $$\nThe condition for strong gate control and suppression of short-channel effects is $L/\\lambda \\gg 1$. Since our calculated ratio is approximately $2$, this condition is not met, indicating that this transistor would suffer from significant short-channel effects. The gate does not have strong control over the channel.\n\nThe final answer to be reported is the numerical value of $\\lambda$.",
