            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and evaluation of the electrostatic scaling length, $\\lambda$, for an ultra-thin-body single-gate MOSFET.\n\nThe starting point is the two-dimensional Laplace equation for the incremental electrostatic potential, $\\tilde{\\phi}(x,y)$, in the charge-free silicon film:\n$$ \\nabla^2 \\tilde{\\phi} = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\tilde{\\phi}}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\tilde{\\phi}}{\\partial y^2} = 0 $$\nThe coordinate system is defined with $x$ along the channel and $y$ perpendicular to it, with the Si/SiO$_2$ interface at $y=0$ and the back of the silicon film at $y=t_{si}$.\n\nWe use the method of separation of variables, assuming a solution of the form $\\tilde{\\phi}(x,y) = X(x)Y(y)$. Substituting this into the Laplace equation and separating the variables yields:\n$$ \\frac{1}{X(x)}\\frac{d^2 X}{dx^2} = -\\frac{1}{Y(y)}\\frac{d^2 Y}{dy^2} $$\nSince the left side is a function of $x$ only and the right side is a function of $y$ only, both must be equal to a constant. The problem states that the potential decays exponentially along the channel as $\\exp(-x/\\lambda)$, which implies that $\\frac{d^2 X}{dx^2} = (1/\\lambda^2) X$. We therefore set the separation constant to $k^2 = 1/\\lambda^2$, where $k$ is the wavenumber.\n\nThe equation for $X(x)$ is $\\frac{d^2 X}{dx^2} = k^2 X$, with a solution of the form $X(x) = A\\exp(-kx) + B\\exp(kx)$. For a potential perturbation decaying away from a source (e.g., at $x=0$) into the channel ($x0$), we choose the decaying solution, so $X(x) \\propto \\exp(-kx)$. This confirms the relationship $k=1/\\lambda$.\n\nThe equation for $Y(y)$ becomes:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 Y}{dy^2} = -k^2 Y $$\nThe general solution for $Y(y)$ is:\n$$ Y(y) = C \\cos(ky) + D \\sin(ky) $$\nThe full solution for the potential is thus $\\tilde{\\phi}(x,y) = \\exp(-kx) [C \\cos(ky) + D \\sin(ky)]$. Now, we must apply the boundary conditions specified in the problem to determine the constants and find the characteristic equation for $k$.\n\nBoundary Condition 1: At the back interface ($y=t_{si}$), the normal electric field is zero.\n$$ \\left.\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{\\phi}}{\\partial y}\\right|_{y=t_{si}} = 0 $$\nFirst, we compute the partial derivative with respect to $y$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{\\phi}}{\\partial y} = \\exp(-kx) [-Ck \\sin(ky) + Dk \\cos(ky)] $$\nApplying the condition at $y=t_{si}$:\n$$ \\exp(-kx) [-Ck \\sin(kt_{si}) + Dk \\cos(kt_{si})] = 0 $$\nFor a non-trivial solution, the term in the brackets must be zero:\n$$ -C \\sin(kt_{si}) + D \\cos(kt_{si}) = 0 \\implies D = C \\tan(kt_{si}) $$\n\nBoundary Condition 2: At the gate-oxide/silicon interface ($y=0$), the linearized displacement continuity is given.\n$$ \\epsilon_{si} \\left.\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{\\phi}}{\\partial y}\\right|_{y=0} = \\frac{\\epsilon_{ox}}{t_{ox}} \\tilde{\\phi}(x,0) $$\nWe evaluate the potential and its derivative at $y=0$:\n$$ \\tilde{\\phi}(x,0) = \\exp(-kx) [C \\cos(0) + D \\sin(0)] = C \\exp(-kx) $$\n$$ \\left.\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{\\phi}}{\\partial y}\\right|_{y=0} = \\exp(-kx) [-Ck \\sin(0) + Dk \\cos(0)] = Dk \\exp(-kx) $$\nSubstituting these into the boundary condition equation:\n$$ \\epsilon_{si} (Dk \\exp(-kx)) = \\frac{\\epsilon_{ox}}{t_{ox}} (C \\exp(-kx)) $$\n$$ \\epsilon_{si} Dk = \\frac{\\epsilon_{ox}}{t_{ox}} C \\implies D = C \\frac{\\epsilon_{ox}}{\\epsilon_{si} k t_{ox}} $$\n\nCombining the results from the two boundary conditions, we obtain the characteristic equation for $k$:\n$$ C \\tan(kt_{si}) = C \\frac{\\epsilon_{ox}}{\\epsilon_{si} k t_{ox}} $$\n$$ \\tan(kt_{si}) = \\frac{\\epsilon_{ox}}{\\epsilon_{si} k t_{ox}} $$\nSubstituting $k = 1/\\lambda$, we get the transcendental equation for the scaling length $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\tan\\left(\\frac{t_{si}}{\\lambda}\\right) = \\frac{\\epsilon_{ox} \\lambda}{\\epsilon_{si} t_{ox}} $$\nThis equation does not have a simple algebraic solution. The problem asks for a closed-form expression derived from an analytic approximation valid in the \"thin-body regime\". This typically refers to the long-wavelength approximation, where the scaling length is assumed to be much larger than the silicon film thickness, i.e., $\\lambda \\gg t_{si}$.\nIn this limit, the argument of the tangent function is small, $t_{si}/\\lambda \\ll 1$, allowing for the first-order Taylor series approximation $\\tan(z) \\approx z$. Applying this approximation:\n$$ \\frac{t_{si}}{\\lambda} \\approx \\frac{\\epsilon_{ox} \\lambda}{\\epsilon_{si} t_{ox}} $$\nThis equation is algebraic and can be solved for $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\lambda^2 \\approx \\frac{\\epsilon_{si} t_{si} t_{ox}}{\\epsilon_{ox}} $$\n$$ \\lambda \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon_{si}}{\\epsilon_{ox}} t_{si} t_{ox}} $$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the scaling length.\n\nWe now evaluate $\\lambda$ using the provided numerical values:\n$\\epsilon_{si} = 11.7 \\,\\epsilon_{0}$\n$\\epsilon_{ox} = 3.9 \\,\\epsilon_{0}$\n$t_{si} = 20\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\n$t_{ox} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\n\nThe ratio of permittivities is:\n$$ \\frac{\\epsilon_{si}}{\\epsilon_{ox}} = \\frac{11.7 \\,\\epsilon_{0}}{3.9 \\,\\epsilon_{0}} = 3.0 $$\nSubstituting the values into the derived expression for $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\lambda \\approx \\sqrt{3.0 \\times (20\\,\\mathrm{nm}) \\times (1.0\\,\\mathrm{nm})} = \\sqrt{60\\,\\mathrm{nm}^2} = \\sqrt{60}\\,\\mathrm{nm} $$\n$$ \\lambda \\approx 7.745966... \\,\\mathrm{nm} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $\\lambda \\approx 7.75\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nFor completeness, we check the validity of the long-wavelength approximation. The ratio $t_{si}/\\lambda \\approx 20\\,\\mathrm{nm} / 7.75\\,\\mathrm{nm} \\approx 2.58$. This value is not small compared to $1$, indicating that the approximation $\\tan(t_{si}/\\lambda) \\approx t_{si}/\\lambda$ is not accurate for these specific parameters. The transcendental equation should be solved numerically for a precise result. However, the problem asks for a derivation based on an analytic approximation, for which the derived formula is the standard result.\n\nFinally, we are asked to interpret the gate control for a channel length $L=16\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. The ratio $L/\\lambda$ is a measure of the gate's control over the channel potential relative to the influence of the source and drain.\n$$ \\frac{L}{\\lambda} \\approx \\frac{16\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{7.75\\,\\mathrm{nm}} \\approx 2.06 $$\nThe condition for strong gate control and suppression of short-channel effects is $L/\\lambda \\gg 1$. Since our calculated ratio is approximately $2$, this condition is not met, indicating that this transistor would suffer from significant short-channel effects. The gate does not have strong control over the channel.\n\nThe final answer to be reported is the numerical value of $\\lambda$.",

It is free of subjective claims or ambiguity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. A solution will be constructed based on the provided information and requirements.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe derivation begins from the fundamental equation for the threshold voltage, $V_T$, of a MOSFET. At the threshold of inversion, the gate voltage, $V_G = V_T$, must be sufficient to offset the flat-band voltage ($V_{FB}$), establish a surface potential equal to twice the bulk Fermi potential ($\\phi_s$, assumed constant here for a given substrate doping), and support the depletion charge ($Q'_{dep}$) in the semiconductor channel.\n\n$$V_T = V_{FB} + \\phi_s + \\frac{Q'_{dep}}{C_{ox}}$$\n\nHere, $C_{ox}$ is the gate oxide capacitance per unit area, and $Q'_{dep}$ is the depletion charge per unit gate area that is controlled by the gate.\n\nFor a long-channel device ($L \\to \\infty$), the two-dimensional field effects from the source and drain are negligible. The gate supports the entire depletion charge, $Q'_{dep} = Q_{dep,\\infty}$. The long-channel threshold voltage $V_{T,\\infty}$ is therefore:\n\n$$V_{T,\\infty} = V_{FB} + \\phi_s + \\frac{Q_{dep,\\infty}}{C_{ox}}$$\n\nFrom this, we can express the component of the threshold voltage required to support the depletion charge:\n$$\\frac{Q_{dep,\\infty}}{C_{ox}} = V_{T,\\infty} - (V_{FB} + \\phi_s)$$\n\nIn a short-channel device, the source and drain junctions create their own depletion regions, which terminate some of the electric field lines that would otherwise be terminated by the gate. This \"charge sharing\" means the gate needs to support only a fraction, $f$, of the total depletion charge to achieve threshold. The effective depletion charge per unit area supported by the gate is $Q'_{dep} = f \\cdot Q_{dep,\\infty}$.\n\nThe short-channel threshold voltage $V_T(L)$ is then:\n$$V_T(L) = V_{FB} + \\phi_s + f \\frac{Q_{dep,\\infty}}{C_{ox}}$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $Q_{dep,\\infty}/C_{ox}$:\n$$V_T(L) = V_{FB} + \\phi_s + f (V_{T,\\infty} - (V_{FB} + \\phi_s))$$\n$$V_T(L) = (1-f)(V_{FB} + \\phi_s) + f V_{T,\\infty}$$\n\nThe threshold voltage shift, $\\Delta V_T = V_{T,\\infty} - V_T(L)$, is:\n$$\\Delta V_T = V_{T,\\infty} - [(1-f)(V_{FB} + \\phi_s) + f V_{T,\\infty}]$$\n$$\\Delta V_T = (1-f) V_{T,\\infty} - (1-f)(V_{FB} + \\phi_s)$$\n$$\\Delta V_T = (1-f)[V_{T,\\infty} - (V_{FB} + \\phi_s)]$$\n\nLet's define a constant $A = V_{T,\\infty} - (V_{FB} + \\phi_s)$, which represents the portion of the long-channel threshold voltage that supports the depletion charge.\n$$\\Delta V_T = (1-f)A$$\n\nThe problem requires constructing a minimal two-parameter model based on an effective encroachment length $L_e$. We propose a model for the charge-sharing factor $f$ that leads to a linearizable form and is consistent with the idea of encroachment. A suitable model expresses $f$ as the ratio of the gate-defined length $L$ to an effective length that includes the encroachment from both source and drain, $L+2L_e$:\n$$f = \\frac{L}{L+2L_e}$$\nThis gives the factor $(1-f)$:\n$$1-f = 1 - \\frac{L}{L+2L_e} = \\frac{L+2L_e-L}{L+2L_e} = \\frac{2L_e}{L+2L_e}$$\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\Delta V_T$:\n$$\\Delta V_T = \\frac{2L_e A}{L+2L_e}$$\n\nThis is the analytical dependence of $\\Delta V_T$ on $L$. The two parameters of this model are the effective encroachment length $L_e$ and the body-effect parameter $A$. To extract these parameters, we linearize the equation. By taking the reciprocal, we get:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\Delta V_T} = \\frac{L+2L_e}{2L_e A} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2L_e A}\\right) L + \\frac{2L_e}{2L_e A}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{\\Delta V_T} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2L_e A}\\right) L + \\frac{1}{A}$$\n\nThis equation is in the linear form $y = mx+c$, where:\n- $y = 1/\\Delta V_T$\n- $x = L$\n- The slope is $m = \\frac{1}{2L_e A}$\n- The y-intercept is $c = \\frac{1}{A}$\n\nFrom the parameters of a linear fit ($m$ and $c$), we can extract $L_e$ and $A$. From the intercept, $A = 1/c$. Substituting this into the slope equation gives $m = 1/(2L_e (1/c)) = c/(2L_e)$. Rearranging for $L_e$:\n$$L_e = \\frac{c}{2m}$$\n\nNow, we apply this method to the given data. First, we compute the values for the linear fit, $(L, 1/\\Delta V_T)$, using the provided $V_{T,\\infty} = 0.420\\,\\mathrm{V}$. The length $L$ will be in nanometers.\n\n| $L$ (nm) | $V_T$ (V) | $\\Delta V_T = V_{T,\\infty} - V_T$ (V) | $1/\\Delta V_T$ (V$^{-1}$) |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $200$ | $0.400$ | $0.020$ | $50.0$ |\n| $120$ | $0.390$ | $0.030$ | $33.333...$ |\n| $80$ | $0.380$ | $0.040$ | $25.0$ |\n| $60$ | $0.372$ | $0.048$ | $20.833...$ |\n| $40$ | $0.360$ | $0.060$ | $16.666...$ |\n| $30$ | $0.351429$ | $0.068571$ | $14.583...$ |\n\nWe perform a linear regression on the dataset $(L, 1/\\Delta V_T)$.\n- Number of points, $N=6$.\n- Sum of $x$ ($L$): $\\sum L_i = 200+120+80+60+40+30 = 530$.\n- Sum of $y$ ($1/\\Delta V_T$): $\\sum y_i \\approx 50.0 + 33.333 + 25.0 + 20.833 + 16.667 + 14.583 = 160.416$.\n- Sum of $x^2$ ($\\sum L_i^2$): $200^2+120^2+80^2+60^2+40^2+30^2 = 40000+14400+6400+3600+1600+900 = 66900$.\n- Sum of $xy$ ($\\sum L_i y_i$): $200(50) + 120(100/3) + 80(25) + 60(125/6) + 40(50/3) + 30(102.08/7) \\approx 10000+4000+2000+1250+666.67+437.5 = 18354.17$.\n\nThe slope $m$ and intercept $c$ are calculated as:\n$$m = \\frac{N \\sum(L_i y_i) - (\\sum L_i)(\\sum y_i)}{N \\sum(L_i^2) - (\\sum L_i)^2} = \\frac{6(18354.17) - (530)(160.416)}{6(66900) - (530)^2} = \\frac{110125 - 85020.5}{401400 - 280900} = \\frac{25104.5}{120500} \\approx 0.208336\\,\\mathrm{V^{-1}nm^{-1}}$$\n$$c = \\frac{\\sum y_i - m \\sum L_i}{N} = \\frac{160.416 - (0.208336)(530)}{6} = \\frac{160.416 - 110.418}{6} = \\frac{50.0}{6} \\approx 8.333\\,\\mathrm{V^{-1}}$$\nThe exact values suggested by the fit are $m=5/24$ and $c=25/3$. Let's use these values for precision.\n$m = 5/24 \\approx 0.208333...$\n$c = 25/3 \\approx 8.33333...$\n\nNow we compute the effective encroachment length $L_e$:\n$$L_e = \\frac{c}{2m} = \\frac{25/3}{2 \\times (5/24)} = \\frac{25/3}{10/24} = \\frac{25}{3} \\times \\frac{24}{10} = \\frac{25 \\times 8}{10} = \\frac{200}{10} = 20\\,\\mathrm{nm}$$\n\nThe extracted effective encroachment length is exactly $20\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. Rounding to three significant figures gives $20.0\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n\n### Physical Meaning of $L_e$\nThe parameter $L_e$ represents an effective length that quantifies the extent of two-dimensional electrostatic charge sharing at the source and drain ends of the MOSFET channel. It is not a directly measurable physical dimension but rather a parameter in a simplified model that captures the complex physics of how the source/drain fields encroach upon the channel region. A larger $L_e$ signifies a greater loss of gate control over the channel charge, leading to more severe short-channel effects like $V_T$ roll-off.\nThe magnitude of $L_e$ is determined by the device's structural and material properties:\n1.  **Junction Depth ($r_j$) and Body/Channel Thickness ($t_{body}$):** Deeper source/drain junctions and thicker semiconductor bodies allow field lines to spread further, increasing $L_e$. Conversely, ultrathin bodies (as in this problem) help confine the fields and reduce $L_e$.\n2.  **Gate Oxide Thickness ($t_{ox}$):** A thinner gate oxide enhances the gate's electrostatic control over the channel, thus reducing the relative influence of the source/drain and decreasing $L_e$.\n3.  **Permittivities ($\\epsilon_{semi}$, $\\epsilon_{ox}$):** The ratio of the semiconductor permittivity to the gate dielectric permittivity influences the distribution of electric fields. A high-permittivity (high-k) dielectric like HfO$_2$ increases the gate's coupling to the channel ($\\epsilon_{ox}$ is large), which helps to suppress short-channel effects and leads to a smaller value of $L_e$ compared to a conventional SiO$_2$ dielectric.\n\nIn essence, $L_e$ is a compact parameter that models how device scaling and material choices impact the gate's ability to control the channel.",

It presents a standard problem in semiconductor device physics that can be solved using the specified first-principles approach.\n\nThe analysis begins with the linear electrostatic response of the channel's saddle-point potential, $\\phi_s$, to changes in the terminal voltages. In the subthreshold regime, the change in $\\phi_s$ from small changes in gate voltage, $\\Delta V_G$, and drain voltage, $\\Delta V_D$, can be expressed using a capacitive divider model:\n$$ \\Delta \\phi_s = \\frac{C_g}{C_{tot}} \\Delta V_G + \\frac{C_d}{C_{tot}} \\Delta V_D $$\nwhere $C_g$ is the effective gate-to-channel capacitance, $C_d$ is the effective drain-to-channel capacitance, and $C_{tot}$ is the total effective capacitance seen by the channel's saddle point. All capacitances are considered per unit of channel length $L$.\n\nDrain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL) is a measure of the influence of the drain voltage on the channel barrier. It is formally defined as the negative rate of change of the threshold voltage, $V_{th}$, with respect to the drain voltage, $V_D$. A change in $V_{th}$ can be seen as the change in $V_G$ required to keep the channel barrier height constant (i.e., $\\Delta \\phi_s = 0$) in response to a change in $V_D$. Setting $\\Delta \\phi_s = 0$ and letting $\\Delta V_G = \\Delta V_{th}$, we have:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{C_g}{C_{tot}} \\Delta V_{th} + \\frac{C_d}{C_{tot}} \\Delta V_D $$\nSolving for the sensitivity of $V_{th}$ to $V_D$:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta V_{th}}{\\Delta V_D} = - \\frac{C_d}{C_g} $$\nDIBL is the magnitude of this quantity, which is typically reported as a positive value in $\\text{mV/V}$.\n$$ \\text{DIBL} = \\left| \\frac{\\partial V_{th}}{\\partial V_D} \\right| = \\frac{C_d}{C_g} $$\nThis expression shows that DIBL is the ratio of the drain's electrostatic influence to the gate's electrostatic influence on the channel barrier. Better gate control, i.e., larger $C_g$, leads to lower DIBL.\n\nThe problem states that $C_d$ is approximately the same for the planar MOSFET and the FinFET, as this coupling is determined primarily by junction and spacer geometries, which are identical. Let this capacitance be $C_d$. The DIBL for the two devices can be written as:\n$$ \\text{DIBL}_{\\text{planar}} = \\frac{C_d}{C_{g, \\text{planar}}} $$\n$$ \\text{DIBL}_{\\text{FinFET}} = \\frac{C_d}{C_{g, \\text{FinFET}}} $$\nwhere $C_{g, \\text{planar}}$ and $C_{g, \\text{FinFET}}$ are the gate-to-channel capacitances per unit length for the planar and FinFET devices, respectively.\n\nThe DIBL reduction factor, $R$, is the ratio of the DIBL of the FinFET to that of the planar device:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\text{DIBL}_{\\text{FinFET}}}{\\text{DIBL}_{\\text{planar}}} = \\frac{C_d / C_{g, \\text{FinFET}}}{C_d / C_{g, \\text{planar}}} = \\frac{C_{g, \\text{planar}}}{C_{g, \\text{FinFET}}} $$\n\nWe are instructed to model the gate capacitance per unit length using a parallel-plate model, $C_g = \\varepsilon_{ox} W_{eff} / t_{ox}$, where $\\varepsilon_{ox}$ is the gate oxide permittivity, $t_{ox}$ is the oxide thickness, and $W_{eff}$ is the effective width of the gate-channel interface per unit channel length.\n\nFor the planar MOSFET, the gate is only on top of the channel. The effective width is simply the physical width of the device, which we denote as $W_{planar}$.\n$$ C_{g, \\text{planar}} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{ox} W_{planar}}{t_{ox}} $$\nFor the tri-gate FinFET, the gate wraps around the fin on three sides: the top surface and the two vertical sidewalls. The total gate-wrapped interface length is the sum of the fin width, $W_{fin}$, and twice the fin height, $H_{fin}$. This constitutes the effective width for the FinFET.\n$$ W_{eff, \\text{FinFET}} = W_{fin} + 2 H_{fin} $$\n$$ C_{g, \\text{FinFET}} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{ox} (W_{fin} + 2 H_{fin})}{t_{ox}} $$\n\nSubstituting these capacitance expressions into the equation for the ratio $R$:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\frac{\\varepsilon_{ox} W_{planar}}{t_{ox}}}{\\frac{\\varepsilon_{ox} (W_{fin} + 2 H_{fin})}{t_{ox}}} = \\frac{W_{planar}}{W_{fin} + 2 H_{fin}} $$\nTo obtain a numerical value, we must establish a basis for comparing the planar device width $W_{planar}$ to the FinFET dimensions. A standard and logical comparison between a planar device and a FinFET on the same technology node is based on an equal silicon footprint width. This implies setting the planar device width equal to the fin width, so we assume $W_{planar} = W_{fin}$. The expression for $R$ simplifies to:\n$$ R = \\frac{W_{fin}}{W_{fin} + 2 H_{fin}} $$\nThis is the final symbolic expression for the DIBL reduction factor.\n\nWe are given the numerical values $W_{fin} = 8\\,\\text{nm}$ and $H_{fin} = 40\\,\\text{nm}$. Substituting these into the expression for $R$:\n$$ R = \\frac{8}{8 + 2(40)} = \\frac{8}{8 + 80} = \\frac{8}{88} = \\frac{1}{11} $$\nFinally, we evaluate the numerical value and round it to four significant figures:\n$$ R = \\frac{1}{11} \\approx 0.090909... $$\n$$ R \\approx 0.09091 $$",
