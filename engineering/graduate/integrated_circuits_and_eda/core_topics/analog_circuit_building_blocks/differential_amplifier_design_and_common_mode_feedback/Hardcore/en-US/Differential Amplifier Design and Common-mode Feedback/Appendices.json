The problem is well-posed and objective, conforming to the principles of MOSFET device physics and analog circuit theory. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe starting point is the standard square-law model for an $n$-channel MOSFET operating in the saturation region. The problem specifies to neglect channel-length modulation and the body effect. Under these simplifying assumptions, the drain current $I_D$ is given by:\n$$I_{D} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} (V_{GS} - V_{TH})^2$$\nwhere $\\mu_{n}$ is the electron mobility, $C_{ox}$ is the gate oxide capacitance per unit area, $W$ and $L$ are the channel width and length, respectively, $V_{GS}$ is the gate-to-source voltage, and $V_{TH}$ is the constant threshold voltage.\n\nThe small-signal transconductance, $g_m$, is defined as the partial derivative of the drain current $I_D$ with respect to the gate-to-source voltage $V_{GS}$, evaluated at the DC operating point.\n$$g_{m} = \\frac{\\partial I_{D}}{\\partial V_{GS}}$$\nTo find $g_m$, we differentiate the expression for $I_D$ with respect to $V_{GS}$, treating all other parameters ($\\mu_{n}$, $C_{ox}$, $W$, $L$, $V_{TH}$) as constants:\n$$g_{m} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_{GS}} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} (V_{GS} - V_{TH})^2 \\right]$$\nApplying the chain rule for differentiation, we obtain:\n$$g_{m} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} \\cdot 2 (V_{GS} - V_{TH}) \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_{GS}}(V_{GS} - V_{TH})$$\n$$g_{m} = \\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} (V_{GS} - V_{TH})$$\nThis expression gives $g_m$ in terms of the overdrive voltage, $(V_{GS} - V_{TH})$. The problem requires an expression in terms of the drain current and device parameters. To achieve this, we first rearrange the saturation current equation to solve for the overdrive voltage:\n$$(V_{GS} - V_{TH})^2 = \\frac{2 I_{D}}{\\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L}}$$\nTaking the square root of both sides (the overdrive voltage is positive for an active device) yields:\n$$V_{GS} - V_{TH} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 I_{D}}{\\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L}}}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $(V_{GS} - V_{TH})$ back into our equation for $g_m$:\n$$g_{m} = \\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{2 I_{D}}{\\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L}}} \\right)$$\nTo simplify, we can bring the term $\\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L}$ inside the square root by squaring it:\n$$g_{m} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{2 I_{D}}{\\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L}}\\right)}$$\n$$g_{m} = \\sqrt{2 I_{D} \\left(\\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L}\\right)}$$\nThis is the transconductance expressed in terms of the branch current $I_D$ and the process/geometry parameters. This is a general result for a MOSFET in saturation under the given assumptions.\n\nThe final step is to relate this to the tail current $I_{tail}$ of the differential pair. The problem states that the amplifier is a symmetric long-tailed pair and that a common-mode feedback (CMFB) loop enforces a constant tail current $I_{tail}$. Under zero differential input, this tail current is split equally between the two identical MOSFETs. Therefore, the DC bias current in each branch is:\n$$I_{D} = \\frac{I_{tail}}{2}$$\nSubstituting this into our expression for $g_m$:\n$$g_{m} = \\sqrt{2 \\left(\\frac{I_{tail}}{2}\\right) \\left(\\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L}\\right)}$$\nThe factor of $2$ cancels, leading to the final expression for the transconductance of each transistor in the differential pair:\n$$g_{m} = \\sqrt{I_{tail} \\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L}}$$\nThis result expresses $g_m$ in terms of the total tail current and the specified device parameters, as required.",

A Common-Mode Feedback (CMFB) loop senses the output common-mode voltage and adjusts the bias to restore the outputs to a target common-mode level.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of CMOS analog integrated circuit design, is well-posed with a complete and consistent set of givens, and is expressed in objective, formal language. The provided parameters are physically realistic. We may, therefore, proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the allowable output common-mode voltage range for a fully differential amplifier, and subsequently, the calculation of the maximum correctable common-mode disturbance. The core principle is that all transistors must remain in the saturation region of operation.\n\nLet the output common-mode voltage be denoted by $V_{\\text{ocm}}$. The amplifier's vertical structure, from the negative supply $V_{\\text{SS}}$ to the positive supply $V_{\\text{DD}}$, consists of the NMOS tail current source, the NMOS input differential pair, and the PMOS active loads. We will analyze the voltage headroom constraints imposed by each of these stages to keep them in saturation.\n\nLet us define the voltage at the common-source node of the input differential pair as $V_{\\text{cs}}$. During a pure common-mode disturbance, the differential outputs are equal: $V_{\\text{o+}} = V_{\\text{o-}} = V_{\\text{ocm}}$.\n\n**Part a) Derivation of $V_{\\text{ocm,min}}$ and $V_{\\text{ocm,max}}$**\n\nWe must satisfy three saturation conditions simultaneously.\n\n1.  **PMOS Active Loads:** The PMOS load transistors have their sources connected to $V_{\\text{DD}}$ and their drains connected to the output nodes, which are at potential $V_{\\text{ocm}}$. For a PMOS transistor to be in saturation, its drain-source voltage magnitude must satisfy $|V_{\\text{DS,p}}| \\ge V_{\\text{DSat,p}}$.\n    The drain-source voltage for the PMOS loads is $V_{\\text{DS,p}} = V_{\\text{ocm}} - V_{\\text{DD}}$.\n    Since $V_{\\text{ocm}}  V_{\\text{DD}}$, the magnitude is $|V_{\\text{DS,p}}| = V_{\\text{DD}} - V_{\\text{ocm}}$.\n    The saturation condition is thus:\n    $$V_{\\text{DD}} - V_{\\text{ocm}} \\ge V_{\\text{DSat,p}}$$\n    Rearranging this inequality to find the upper bound on $V_{\\text{ocm}}$ gives:\n    $$V_{\\text{ocm}} \\le V_{\\text{DD}} - V_{\\text{DSat,p}}$$\n    This defines the maximum output common-mode voltage:\n    $$V_{\\text{ocm,max}} = V_{\\text{DD}} - V_{\\text{DSat,p}}$$\n\n2.  **NMOS Tail Current Source:** The NMOS tail transistor has its source connected to $V_{\\text{SS}}$ and its drain connected to the common-source node, $V_{\\text{cs}}$. For this NMOS transistor to be in saturation, its drain-source voltage must satisfy $V_{\\text{DS,t}} \\ge V_{\\text{DSat,t}}$.\n    The drain-source voltage is $V_{\\text{DS,t}} = V_{\\text{cs}} - V_{\\text{SS}}$.\n    The saturation condition is:\n    $$V_{\\text{cs}} - V_{\\text{SS}} \\ge V_{\\text{DSat,t}}$$\n    This sets a lower bound on the voltage of the common-source node:\n    $$V_{\\text{cs}} \\ge V_{\\text{SS}} + V_{\\text{DSat,t}}$$\n\n3.  **NMOS Input Pair:** The NMOS input transistors have their drains connected to the output nodes ($V_{\\text{ocm}}$) and their sources connected to the common-source node ($V_{\\text{cs}}$). For these NMOS transistors to be in saturation, their drain-source voltage must satisfy $V_{\\text{DS,n}} \\ge V_{\\text{DSat,n}}$.\n    The drain-source voltage is $V_{\\text{DS,n}} = V_{\\text{ocm}} - V_{\\text{cs}}$.\n    The saturation condition is:\n    $$V_{\\text{ocm}} - V_{\\text{cs}} \\ge V_{\\text{DSat,n}}$$\n    This sets an upper bound on the voltage of the common-source node relative to the output:\n    $$V_{\\text{cs}} \\le V_{\\text{ocm}} - V_{\\text{DSat,n}}$$\n\nTo find the overall constraint for the lower limit of $V_{\\text{ocm}}$, we combine the inequalities for $V_{\\text{cs}}$ from steps 2 and 3. For a valid operating point to exist, there must be an allowable value for $V_{\\text{cs}}$, which means the lower bound on $V_{\\text{cs}}$ must be less than or equal to its upper bound:\n$$V_{\\text{SS}} + V_{\\text{DSat,t}} \\le V_{\\text{cs}} \\le V_{\\text{ocm}} - V_{\\text{DSat,n}}$$\nThis requires that:\n$$V_{\\text{SS}} + V_{\\text{DSat,t}} \\le V_{\\text{ocm}} - V_{\\text{DSat,n}}$$\nRearranging for $V_{\\text{ocm}}$ gives the lower bound on the output common-mode voltage:\n$$V_{\\text{ocm}} \\ge V_{\\text{SS}} + V_{\\text{DSat,n}} + V_{\\text{DSat,t}}$$\nThis defines the minimum output common-mode voltage:\n$$V_{\\text{ocm,min}} = V_{\\text{SS}} + V_{\\text{DSat,n}} + V_{\\text{DSat,t}}$$\n\nIn summary, the allowable output common-mode swing bounds are:\n$$V_{\\text{ocm,min}} = V_{\\text{SS}} + V_{\\text{DSat,n}} + V_{\\text{DSat,t}}$$\n$$V_{\\text{ocm,max}} = V_{\\text{DD}} - V_{\\text{DSat,p}}$$\n\n**Part b) Calculation of Maximum Correctable Disturbance**\n\nThe Common-Mode Feedback (CMFB) loop can successfully restore the target output common-mode level, $V_{\\text{ocm,ref}}$, as long as the output common-mode voltage, $V_{\\text{ocm}}$, remains within the valid range $[V_{\\text{ocm,min}}, V_{\\text{ocm,max}}]$ throughout the process. The critical moment is immediately after a large-signal step disturbance, before the CMFB has had time to correct it.\n\nLet the magnitude of the step disturbance be $\\Delta V$.\nIf the disturbance is positive, the new voltage is $V_{\\text{ocm}} = V_{\\text{ocm,ref}} + \\Delta V$. To remain valid, this must be less than or equal to $V_{\\text{ocm,max}}$:\n$$V_{\\text{ocm,ref}} + \\Delta V \\le V_{\\text{ocm,max}}$$\nThis implies the maximum tolerable positive step magnitude is:\n$$\\Delta V_{\\text{max,+}} = V_{\\text{ocm,max}} - V_{\\text{ocm,ref}}$$\n\nIf the disturbance is negative, the new voltage is $V_{\\text{ocm}} = V_{\\text{ocm,ref}} - \\Delta V$. To remain valid, this must be greater than or equal to $V_{\\text{ocm,min}}$:\n$$V_{\\text{ocm,ref}} - \\Delta V \\ge V_{\\text{ocm,min}}$$\nThis implies the maximum tolerable negative step magnitude is:\n$$\\Delta V_{\\text{max,-}} = V_{\\text{ocm,ref}} - V_{\\text{ocm,min}}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum magnitude of a single-step disturbance, which could be in either direction. The CMFB loop must be able to handle both positive and negative steps. Therefore, the maximum allowable magnitude of the step, $\\Delta V_{\\text{max}}$, is limited by the smaller of these two margins.\n$$\\Delta V_{\\text{max}} = \\min(\\Delta V_{\\text{max,+}}, \\Delta V_{\\text{max,-}})$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the margins, we obtain the closed-form expression:\n$$\\Delta V_{\\text{max}} = \\min(V_{\\text{ocm,max}} - V_{\\text{ocm,ref}}, V_{\\text{ocm,ref}} - V_{\\text{ocm,min}})$$\n\nNow, we evaluate this numerically using the provided parameters:\n$V_{\\text{DD}} = 1.8\\,\\text{V}$\n$V_{\\text{SS}} = 0\\,\\text{V}$\n$V_{\\text{DSat,n}} = 0.27\\,\\text{V}$\n$V_{\\text{DSat,p}} = 0.31\\,\\text{V}$\n$V_{\\text{DSat,t}} = 0.12\\,\\text{V}$\n$V_{\\text{ocm,ref}} = 0.90\\,\\text{V}$\n\nFirst, calculate the voltage bounds:\n$$V_{\\text{ocm,max}} = V_{\\text{DD}} - V_{\\text{DSat,p}} = 1.8\\,\\text{V} - 0.31\\,\\text{V} = 1.49\\,\\text{V}$$\n$$V_{\\text{ocm,min}} = V_{\\text{SS}} + V_{\\text{DSat,n}} + V_{\\text{DSat,t}} = 0\\,\\text{V} + 0.27\\,\\text{V} + 0.12\\,\\text{V} = 0.39\\,\\text{V}$$\nThe valid common-mode range is $[0.39\\,\\text{V}, 1.49\\,\\text{V}]$.
