            "problem": "In a complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) operational transconductance amplifier that employs a folded-cascode front end, the feasibility of achieving a target open-loop gain is often first assessed from the per-device intrinsic gain of the input transistor. Consider a metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor biased in strong or moderate inversion at a drain current of $I_{D}=100\\,\\mu\\text{A}$ in a process intended for low-voltage analog design. For this technology, a small-signal transconductance efficiency of $g_{m}/I_{D}=20\\,\\text{V}^{-1}$ is observed at the chosen inversion level, and the channel-length modulation parameter is approximately $\\lambda=0.1\\,\\text{V}^{-1}$ at the relevant drain–source voltage. Ignore body effect, drain-induced barrier lowering, and velocity saturation, and assume that small-signal linearization around the bias point is valid.\n\nStarting from the small-signal definitions of transconductance $g_{m}$ and output conductance $g_{ds}$ for a saturated metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor, and the definition of intrinsic gain as the magnitude of the small-signal voltage gain of a common-source device loaded by its own small-signal output resistance, derive an expression for the intrinsic gain $A_{0}$ in terms of $g_{m}/I_{D}$ and $\\lambda$, then evaluate it numerically for the given parameters.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation and numerical evaluation of the intrinsic gain $A_0$ of a metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET), based on its small-signal parameters. The intrinsic gain is a fundamental figure of merit representing the maximum possible voltage gain of a single transistor configured as a common-source amplifier, loaded only by its own output resistance.\n\nFirst, we establish the definition of intrinsic gain. The voltage gain $A_v$ of a common-source amplifier is given by the product of its transconductance $g_m$ and the total output resistance $R_{out}$, with a negative sign indicating signal inversion:\n$$A_v = -g_m R_{out}$$\nThe problem defines the intrinsic gain, denoted $A_0$, as the magnitude of this voltage gain when the amplifier is loaded by its own small-signal output resistance, $r_o$. The output resistance $r_o$ is the inverse of the output conductance, $g_{ds}$. Therefore, we set $R_{out} = r_o = 1/g_{ds}$.\nThe intrinsic gain $A_0$ is then:\n$$A_0 = |-g_m r_o| = g_m r_o = \\frac{g_m}{g_{ds}}$$\n\nNext, we must express $g_m$ and $g_{ds}$ in terms of the parameters provided in the problem statement. The problem provides the transconductance efficiency $g_m/I_D$ and the channel-length modulation parameter $\\lambda$.\n\nThe transconductance $g_m$ can be directly written as:\n$$g_m = \\left(\\frac{g_m}{I_D}\\right) I_D$$\nwhere $I_D$ is the DC bias drain current.\n\nThe output conductance $g_{ds}$ is defined as the partial derivative of the drain current $I_D$ with respect to the drain-source voltage $V_{DS}$ at a constant gate-source voltage $V_{GS}$:\n$$g_{ds} = \\frac{\\partial I_D}{\\partial V_{DS}} \\bigg|_{V_{GS}=\\text{const}}$$\nThe parameter $\\lambda$ is used in the simple first-order model for the drain current of a MOSFET in the saturation region, which accounts for channel-length modulation:\n$$I_D = I_{D,sat_0}(1 + \\lambda V_{DS})$$\nHere, $I_{D,sat_0}$ is the drain current at the edge of saturation (i.e., for $V_{DS} = V_{GS} - V_{th}$) and is independent of $V_{DS}$. Taking the partial derivative with respect to $V_{DS}$:\n$$g_{ds} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_{DS}} [I_{D,sat_0}(1 + \\lambda V_{DS})] = \\lambda I_{D,sat_0}$$\nIn common practice, the DC bias current $I_D$ is approximated as being very close to $I_{D,sat_0}$, especially when $\\lambda V_{DS} \\ll 1$. Thus, we can write:\n$$g_{ds} \\approx \\lambda I_D$$\nThis approximation is standard for hand analysis and is implied by the problem's request to relate the parameters.\n\nNow we can substitute the expressions for $g_m$ and $g_{ds}$ into the equation for $A_0$:\n$$A_0 = \\frac{g_m}{g_{ds}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{g_m}{I_D}\\right) I_D}{\\lambda I_D}$$\nThe drain current $I_D$ cancels out from the numerator and the denominator, yielding the final expression for the intrinsic gain in terms of the given parameters:\n$$A_0 = \\frac{g_m/I_D}{\\lambda}$$\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically using the provided values: $g_m/I_D = 20\\,\\text{V}^{-1}$ and $\\lambda = 0.1\\,\\text{V}^{-1}$. The drain current value $I_D=100\\,\\mu\\text{A}$ is consistent with the other parameters but is not needed for the final calculation of $A_0$.\n$$A_0 = \\frac{20\\,\\text{V}^{-1}}{0.1\\,\\text{V}^{-1}} = 200$$\nThe result is a dimensionless quantity, as expected for voltage gain. The problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. Since the calculation results in exactly $200$, no rounding is necessary.\n\nFinally, we are asked to explain qualitatively how $A_0$ depends on $\\lambda$ in the neighborhood of the operating point. From our derived expression $A_0 = (g_m/I_D) / \\lambda$, it is evident that the intrinsic gain $A_0$ is inversely proportional to the channel-length modulation parameter $\\lambda$, assuming the transconductance efficiency $g_m/I_D$ is held constant. The parameter $\\lambda$ characterizes the undesirable effect of the drain-source voltage on the drain current in a saturated MOSFET; a higher value of $\\lambda$ signifies a more pronounced channel-length modulation effect. This corresponds to a lower small-signal output resistance $r_o$, since $r_o = 1/g_{ds} \\approx 1/(\\lambda I_D)$. Because the intrinsic gain is the product of transconductance and output resistance, $A_0 = g_m r_o$, a device with a larger $\\lambda$ will have a lower $r_o$ and consequently a lower intrinsic gain. Therefore, to achieve high gain in amplifier design, it is desirable to use transistors with the smallest possible $\\lambda$, which is typically achieved by using longer channel lengths.",

            "problem": "Consider the design of single-stage operational amplifiers used within integrated circuits and Electronic Design Automation (EDA) workflows. Two architectures are of interest: a telescopic cascode and a folded-cascode. Each amplifier is configured as a unity-gain buffer and is driven at its closed-loop unity-gain frequency by a sinusoidal input. Assume that small-signal behavior is well approximated by a single transconductor of transconductance $g_{m}$ driving a capacitive output node of capacitance $C_{L}$, and that the unity-gain frequency equals the gain-bandwidth product (GBW), denoted $f_{u}$ in hertz. Large-signal behavior is limited by the maximum available output current that can be sourced or sunk into the capacitive output node.\n\nUnder large-signal conditions:\n- For the telescopic cascode, the maximum source and sink currents available at the output node are both equal to a bias-limited current $I_{T}$.\n- For the folded-cascode, the maximum source current at the output node is $I_{P}$ and the maximum sink current is $I_{N}$. Let $I_{F}$ denote the smaller of $I_{P}$ and $I_{N}$.\n\nYou may assume that charge conservation at the output capacitance and the single-pole small-signal model apply. The input is a sinusoid at frequency $f_{u}$ with amplitude $V_{\\text{in,peak}}$, and the output tracks the input in unity-gain feedback until slewing begins.\n\nDerive, in closed form, the input amplitude at which slewing begins for each architecture, expressed in terms of $f_{u}$, $C_{L}$, and the relevant current limits ($I_{T}$ for telescopic and $I_{F}$ for folded). Express your final answers in volts. No numerical evaluation is required, and no rounding should be applied.",
            "solution": "The analysis proceeds by determining the condition under which the amplifier's output can no longer follow the input signal. This condition, known as slewing, occurs when the required rate of change of the output voltage exceeds the maximum possible rate of change the amplifier can provide. This maximum rate is the Slew Rate (SR).\n\nLet the sinusoidal input signal be described by:\n$$v_{\\text{in}}(t) = V_{\\text{in,peak}} \\sin(2\\pi f_{u} t)$$\nIn a unity-gain buffer configuration, under non-slewing (linear) operation, the output voltage $v_{\\text{out}}(t)$ tracks the input voltage:\n$$v_{\\text{out}}(t) = v_{\\text{in}}(t) = V_{\\text{in,peak}} \\sin(2\\pi f_{u} t)$$\nThe rate of change of the output voltage required to follow this input is its time derivative:\n$$\\frac{dv_{\\text{out}}(t)}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( V_{\\text{in,peak}} \\sin(2\\pi f_{u} t) \\right) = 2\\pi f_{u} V_{\\text{in,peak}} \\cos(2\\pi f_{u} t)$$\nThe maximum required rate of change occurs when the cosine term is equal to $1$.\n$$\\left| \\frac{dv_{\\text{out}}}{dt} \\right|_{\\text{max}} = 2\\pi f_{u} V_{\\text{in,peak}}$$\nThis is the demand placed on the amplifier by the input signal.\n\nNext, we determine the maximum rate of change the amplifier can supply. The output node is modeled as a capacitor $C_{L}$. The current $I_{out}$ flowing into or out of this capacitor determines the rate of change of the output voltage according to the relation for a capacitor:\n$$I_{out}(t) = C_{L} \\frac{dv_{\\text{out}}(t)}{dt}$$\nThis implies:\n$$\\frac{dv_{\\text{out}}(t)}{dt} = \\frac{I_{out}(t)}{C_{L}}$$\nThe amplifier's output stage has a finite current sourcing and sinking capability. Let the maximum available output current (either sourcing or sinking) be denoted by $I_{\\text{max}}$. The maximum possible rate of change of the output voltage is the Slew Rate (SR):\n$$SR = \\left| \\frac{dv_{\\text{out}}}{dt} \\right|_{\\text{supply,max}} = \\frac{I_{\\text{max}}}{C_{L}}$$\nSlewing begins at the point where the required rate of change equals the maximum rate the amplifier can supply. We equate the maximum required rate with the slew rate:\n$$\\left| \\frac{dv_{\\text{out}}}{dt} \\right|_{\\text{max}} = SR$$\n$$2\\pi f_{u} V_{\\text{in,peak}} = \\frac{I_{\\text{max}}}{C_{L}}$$\nSolving for the input amplitude $V_{\\text{in,peak}}$ at the onset of slewing gives the general expression:\n$$V_{\\text{in,peak}} = \\frac{I_{\\text{max}}}{2\\pi f_{u} C_{L}}$$\nWe now apply this general result to the two specific architectures.\n\n#### Telescopic Cascode Amplifier\nFor the telescopic cascode, the problem states that the maximum source and sink currents are both equal to $I_{T}$. Therefore, the limiting current for both positive and negative slewing is $I_{\\text{max}} = I_{T}$.\nSubstituting this into the general expression, the input amplitude at which slewing begins, $V_{\\text{in,peak,T}}$, is:\n$$V_{\\text{in,peak,T}} = \\frac{I_{T}}{2\\pi f_{u} C_{L}}$$\n\n#### Folded-Cascode Amplifier\nFor the folded-cascode, the maximum source current is $I_{P}$ and the maximum sink current is $I_{N}$. The slew rate depends on the direction of the voltage swing. The source-limited slew rate is $SR_{\\text{source}} = I_{P}/C_{L}$ and the sink-limited slew rate is $SR_{\\text{sink}} = I_{N}/C_{L}$. Slewing of the sinusoidal output will occur if either the rising or falling slope requirement exceeds the corresponding limit. The overall performance is constrained by the smaller of the two available currents. The problem defines $I_{F} = \\min(I_{P}, I_{N})$. Thus, the effective maximum current that guarantees symmetric, non-slewed response is $I_{\\text{max}} = I_{F}$.\nSubstituting this into the general expression, the input amplitude at which slewing begins, $V_{\\text{in,peak,F}}$, is:\n$$V_{\\text{in,peak,F}} = \\frac{I_{F}}{2\\pi f_{u} C_{L}}$$\n\nThese are the final closed-form expressions for the input amplitudes at the onset of slewing for the two architectures.",
