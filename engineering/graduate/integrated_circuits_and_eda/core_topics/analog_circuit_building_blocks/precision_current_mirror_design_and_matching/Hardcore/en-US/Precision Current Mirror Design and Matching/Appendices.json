The large gate area of $M_2$ ($A_2 = 38.88\\,\\mu\\text{m}^2$) will dominate the capacitance at the shared gate node, likely forming a dominant pole that limits the mirror's bandwidth.\n- **Statistical Matching:** This area-minimized design has poor matching precision. According to Pelgrom’s law, mismatch is inversely proportional to the square root of the gate area ($1/\\sqrt{WL}$). The extremely small area of the reference transistor $M_1$ ($A_1 \\approx 0.13\\,\\mu\\text{m}^2$) makes the current ratio highly susceptible to random process variations. Furthermore, using different channel lengths ($L_1 = 0.18\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, $L_2 = 1.8\\,\\mu\\text{m}$) makes the circuit sensitive to systematic process gradients. A more robust design would use equal lengths, but this would violate the area budget. The problem formulation forces a trade-off where area is prioritized over matching accuracy.",

The problem states that both $1{:}1$ current mirrors must have a $3$-standard-deviation ($3\\sigma$) relative current ratio error of $0.01$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the BJT current mirror. The collector current, $I_C$, of a BJT operating in the forward-active region is described by the Ebers-Moll model:\n$$I_C = I_S \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{BE}}}{U_T}\\right)$$\nwhere $I_S$ is the saturation current, $V_{\\mathrm{BE}}$ is the base-emitter voltage, and $U_T = k_B T / q$ is the thermal voltage.
