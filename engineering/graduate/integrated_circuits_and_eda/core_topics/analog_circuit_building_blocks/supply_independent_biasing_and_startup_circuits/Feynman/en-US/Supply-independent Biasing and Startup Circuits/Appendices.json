The thermal voltage, denoted by $V_{T}$, is defined by the well-tested physical relation $V_{T} = \\frac{k_{B} T}{q}$, where $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant and $q$ is the elementary charge.

The exact linearity of $V_{T}$ with absolute temperature means that any quantity proportional to $V_{T}$, such as $\\Delta V_{BE} = V_{T} \\ln(N)$ generated by a pair of bipolar junction transistors with emitter area ratio $N$, is also linear in $T$. This linearity is exploited in PTAT current generators, where a resistor $R$ converts $\\Delta V_{BE}$ into a current $I_{\\mathrm{PTAT}} = \\frac{\\Delta V_{BE}}{R} = \\frac{V_{T} \\ln(N)}{R}$ that scales proportionally with $T$, aiding in compensation of complementary-to-absolute-temperature behaviors (e.g., the base-emitter voltage $V_{BE}$ decrease with $T$) and in forming temperature-stable references such as the bandgap reference. In supply-independent biasing loops, the proportional scaling of $V_{T}$ with $T$ supports generating currents set primarily by temperature and device geometry rather than supply voltage, provided that headroom constraints are satisfied. However, self-biased PTAT loops admit a trivial zero-current equilibrium; therefore, a startup circuit is necessary to force the loop into the intended nonzero PTAT operating point at power-up. The magnitude of $\\frac{dV_{T}}{dT}$ quantifies how strongly the PTAT term grows with $T$ and thus informs the choice of $\\ln(N)$ and resistor $R$ to achieve target temperature coefficients while ensuring robust startup across process, voltage, and temperature corners.\n\nFinally, per the problem’s instruction, the required reported quantity is the temperature coefficient in $\\mathrm{mV/K}$ rounded to four significant figures:\n$$\n\\frac{dV_{T}}{dT} \\approx 0.08617\\,\\mathrm{mV/K}.\n$$",
