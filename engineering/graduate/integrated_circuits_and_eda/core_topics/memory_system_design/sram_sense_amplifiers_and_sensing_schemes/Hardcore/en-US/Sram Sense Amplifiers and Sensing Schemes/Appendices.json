Express the final time in seconds. The final answer must be a single analytic expression.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is determined to be a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in the domain of electronic circuit analysis. It is self-contained and free of contradictions. The solution proceeds by applying fundamental principles of circuit theory.\n\nThe problem describes the precharging of an SRAM bitline, which is modeled as a first-order RC circuit. The circuit consists of an ideal voltage source $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$, a resistor $R_{\\mathrm{PC}}$, and a capacitor $C_{\\mathrm{BL}}$ connected in series. The bitline voltage, denoted as $V_{\\mathrm{BL}}(t)$, is the voltage across the capacitor $C_{\\mathrm{BL}}$. The precharge operation begins at time $t=0$.\n\nAccording to Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL), the sum of the voltage drops around the closed loop must equal the source voltage. The voltage drop across the resistor is $V_R(t)$ and the voltage across the capacitor is $V_{\\mathrm{BL}}(t)$. Thus, we can write:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{DD}} = V_R(t) + V_{\\mathrm{BL}}(t)$$\nThe current $I(t)$ flowing through the resistor is given by Ohm's Law: $V_R(t) = I(t) R_{\\mathrm{PC}}$. This same current charges the capacitor. The current-voltage relationship for a capacitor is $I(t) = C_{\\mathrm{BL}} \\frac{d V_{\\mathrm{BL}}(t)}{dt}$.\n\nSubstituting these relationships into the KVL equation, we obtain the governing first-order linear ordinary differential equation for the bitline voltage $V_{\\mathrm{BL}}(t)$:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{DD}} = R_{\\mathrm{PC}} \\left( C_{\\mathrm{BL}} \\frac{d V_{\\mathrm{BL}}(t)}{dt} \\right) + V_{\\mathrm{BL}}(t)$$\nRearranging this equation into standard form gives:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{PC}} C_{\\mathrm{BL}} \\frac{d V_{\\mathrm{BL}}}{dt} + V_{\\mathrm{BL}} = V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$$\nLet the time constant of the circuit be $\\tau = R_{\\mathrm{PC}} C_{\\mathrm{BL}}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\\tau \\frac{d V_{\\mathrm{BL}}}{dt} + V_{\\mathrm{BL}} = V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$$\nThe general solution to this differential equation is the sum of the homogeneous solution and the particular (steady-state) solution.\nThe homogeneous equation is $\\tau \\frac{d V_{\\mathrm{BL},h}}{dt} + V_{\\mathrm{BL},h} = 0$, which has the solution $V_{\\mathrm{BL},h}(t) = A \\exp(-t/\\tau)$ for some constant $A$.\nThe particular solution is the steady-state voltage as $t \\to \\infty$, where the capacitor is fully charged and no current flows ($\\frac{d V_{\\mathrm{BL}}}{dt} = 0$). In this state, $V_{\\mathrm{BL,p}} = V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$.\nThe complete general solution is:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{BL}}(t) = V_{\\mathrm{BL},h}(t) + V_{\\mathrm{BL,p}}(t) = A \\exp(-t/\\tau) + V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$$\nTo find the constant $A$, we apply the initial condition given in the problem: at $t=0$, the bitline voltage is $V_{\\mathrm{BL}}(0)=0$.\n$$V_{\\mathrm{BL}}(0) = A \\exp(0) + V_{\\mathrm{DD}} = A + V_{\\mathrm{DD}} = 0$$\nSolving for $A$, we find $A = -V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$.\nSubstituting this value of $A$ back into the general solution gives the specific solution for the bitline voltage as a function of time:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{BL}}(t) = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{DD}} \\exp(-t/\\tau)$$\nThis can be factored as:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{BL}}(t) = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} (1 - \\exp(-t/\\tau)) = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} (1 - \\exp(-t/(R_{\\mathrm{PC}} C_{\\mathrm{BL}})))$$\nThe problem requires finding the minimum precharge time, $t_{\\mathrm{pc}}$, such that the bitline voltage is within a small tolerance $\\delta$ of the final supply voltage $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$. This condition is expressed as:\n$$|V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{BL}}(t_{\\mathrm{pc}})| \\le \\delta$$\nDuring the charging process, the bitline voltage $V_{\\mathrm{BL}}(t)$ approaches $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$ from below, so $V_{\\mathrm{BL}}(t) \\le V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$ for all $t \\ge 0$. Therefore, the term $V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{BL}}(t)$ is non-negative, and the absolute value can be removed:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{BL}}(t_{\\mathrm{pc}}) \\le \\delta$$\nThe minimum time $t_{\\mathrm{pc}}$ will be the time at which the equality holds:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{BL}}(t_{\\mathrm{pc}}) = \\delta$$\nNow, we substitute our derived expression for $V_{\\mathrm{BL}}(t)$:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - \\left( V_{\\mathrm{DD}} (1 - \\exp(-t_{\\mathrm{pc}}/(R_{\\mathrm{PC}} C_{\\mathrm{BL}}))) \\right) = \\delta$$\nSimplifying the left side of the equation:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{DD}} + V_{\\mathrm{DD}} \\exp(-t_{\\mathrm{pc}}/(R_{\\mathrm{PC}} C_{\\mathrm{BL}})) = \\delta$$\n$$V_{\\mathrm{DD}} \\exp(-t_{\\mathrm{pc}}/(R_{\\mathrm{PC}} C_{\\mathrm{BL}})) = \\delta$$\nTo solve for $t_{\\mathrm{pc}}$, we first isolate the exponential term:\n$$\\exp(-t_{\\mathrm{pc}}/(R_{\\mathrm{PC}} C_{\\mathrm{BL}})) = \\frac{\\delta}{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}$$\nNext, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\exp(-t_{\\mathrm{pc}}/(R_{\\mathrm{PC}} C_{\\mathrm{BL}}))\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\delta}{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}\\right)$$\n$$- \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{pc}}}{R_{\\mathrm{PC}} C_{\\mathrm{BL}}} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\delta}{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}\\right)$$\nFinally, we solve for $t_{\\mathrm{pc}}$:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{pc}} = - R_{\\mathrm{PC}} C_{\\mathrm{BL}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\delta}{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}\\right)$$\nUsing the logarithmic identity $-\\ln(x/y) = \\ln(y/x)$, we can write the expression in a more intuitive form. Since $\\delta$ is a small positive tolerance, we have $V_{\\mathrm{DD}} > \\delta$, which ensures the argument of the logarithm is greater than $1$ and hence $t_{\\mathrm{pc}} > 0$.\n$$t_{\\mathrm{pc}} = R_{\\mathrm{PC}} C_{\\mathrm{BL}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}{\\delta}\\right)$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the minimum precharge time required to meet the specified tolerance.

            "solution": "The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. All parameters and assumptions are standard in the analysis of sense amplifiers in integrated circuits. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem starts with the definition of the decision probability $P_{\\mathrm{H}}(v_{d})$ as the probability that a sense amplifier resolves to logic-high, given a differential input voltage $v_{d}$. This probability is determined by the relationship between the applied input $v_{d}$ and an effective input-referred random offset voltage $X$.
