            "problem": "A Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM) decoder in an Electronic Design Automation (EDA) flow employs a two-stage path consisting of a predecode gate followed by a wordline driver. The predecode is realized as a three-input NAND gate, and the final stage is a simple inverter that drives the wordline. The wordline presents a capacitive load $C_{WL}$ to the driver.

The provided parameters, such as logical efforts for standard gates ($g_{1} = 5/3$ for a $3$-input NAND, $g_{2} = 1$ for an inverter) and parasitic delays, are standard textbook values. The capacitance values are physically realistic for on-chip interconnects and gates in a modern technology node. The problem is well-posed, providing a clear objective function (path delay) to be minimized, subject to a well-defined constraint (input capacitance budget). The setup is complete, self-contained, and free of contradictions. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A detailed solution follows.\n\nThe total delay, $D$, of the two-stage path is the sum of the individual stage delays, $d_1$ and $d_2$:\n$$D = d_1 + d_2$$\nThe delay of each stage $i$ is given by the sum of its stage effort, $f_i$, and its parasitic delay, $p_i$:\n$$d_i = f_i + p_i$$\nThe stage effort is the product of the stage's logical effort, $g_i$, and its electrical effort, $h_i$:\n$$f_i = g_i h_i$$\nThe electrical effort is the ratio of the capacitance a stage drives ($C_{\\text{out},i}$) to the stage's own input capacitance ($C_{\\text{in},i}$), multiplied by its branching factor $b_i$:\n$$h_i = b_i \\frac{C_{\\text{out},i}}{C_{\\text{in},i}}$$\nLet $C_{\\text{in},1}$ be the input capacitance of the stage $1$ NAND gate and $C_{\\text{in},2}$ be the input capacitance of the stage $2$ inverter. The load capacitance for stage $1$ is the input capacitance of stage $2$, so $C_{\\text{out},1} = C_{\\text{in},2}$. The load capacitance for stage $2$ is the wordline capacitance, $C_{\\text{out},2} = C_{WL}$.\n\nThe stage efforts can now be expressed in terms of these capacitances:\n$$f_1 = g_1 h_1 = g_1 b_1 \\frac{C_{\\text{in},2}}{C_{\\text{in},1}}$$\n$$f_2 = g_2 h_2 = g_2 b_2 \\frac{C_{WL}}{C_{\\text{in},2}}$$\nThe total path delay, $D$, as a function of $C_{\\text{in},1}$ and $C_{\\text{in},2}$ is:\n$$D(C_{\\text{in},1}, C_{\\text{in},2}) = d_1 + d_2 = (f_1 + p_1) + (f_2 + p_2) = g_1 b_1 \\frac{C_{\\text{in},2}}{C_{\\text{in},1}} + p_1 + g_2 b_2 \\frac{C_{WL}}{C_{\\text{in},2}} + p_2$$\nThis expression is to be minimized subject to the constraint that the decoder's input capacitance does not exceed the budget:\n$$C_{\\text{in},1} \\le C_{\\text{budget}}$$\nTo analyze the effect of this constraint, let us inspect the delay equation. The first term, $g_1 b_1 \\frac{C_{\\text{in},2}}{C_{\\text{in},1}}$, is inversely proportional to $C_{\\text{in},1}$. The other terms are independent of $C_{\\text{in},1}$. Therefore, for any fixed value of $C_{\\text{in},2}$, the total delay $D$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $C_{\\text{in},1}$. To minimize $D$, we must make $C_{\\text{in},1}$ as large as possible. The maximum allowed value for $C_{\\text{in},1}$ is $C_{\\text{budget}}$. Thus, the optimal solution must fully utilize the input capacitance budget. We set:\n$$C_{\\text{in},1}^{\\star} = C_{\\text{budget}}$$\nWith $C_{\\text{in},1}$ fixed at $C_{budget}$, the problem reduces to minimizing the delay with respect to the single variable $C_{\\text{in},2}$:\n$$D(C_{\\text{in},2}) = g_1 b_1 \\frac{C_{\\text{in},2}}{C_{\\text{budget}}} + g_2 b_2 \\frac{C_{WL}}{C_{\\text{in},2}} + (p_1 + p_2)$$\nTo find the optimal value $C_{\\text{in},2}^{\\star}$ that minimizes this expression, we take the derivative of $D$ with respect to $C_{\\text{in},2}$ and set it to zero:\n$$\\frac{\\partial D}{\\partial C_{\\text{in},2}} = \\frac{g_1 b_1}{C_{\\text{budget}}} - \\frac{g_2 b_2 C_{WL}}{(C_{\\text{in},2})^2} = 0$$\nSolving for $C_{\\text{in},2}$:\n$$\\frac{g_1 b_1}{C_{\\text{budget}}} = \\frac{g_2 b_2 C_{WL}}{(C_{\\text{in},2})^2}$$\n$$(C_{\\text{in},2})^2 = \\frac{g_2 b_2 C_{WL} C_{\\text{budget}}}{g_1 b_1}$$\n$$C_{\\text{in},2}^{\\star} = \\sqrt{\\frac{g_2 b_2 C_{WL} C_{\\text{budget}}}{g_1 b_1}}$$\nThis result corresponds to the condition where the stage efforts are equal, $f_1 = f_2$, which is the fundamental principle for minimizing delay in a logic path with no constraints on intermediate capacitances.\n\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values to find the optimal capacitances.\nThe optimal input capacitance for the predecode gate (stage $1$) is:\n$$C_{\\text{in},1}^{\\star} = C_{\\text{budget}} = 15 \\ \\text{fF}$$\nTo find the optimal input capacitance for the wordline driver (stage $2$), we first calculate the products $g_1 b_1$ and $g_2 b_2$:\n$$g_1 b_1 = \\frac{5}{3} \\times 12 = 20$$\n$$g_2 b_2 = 1 \\times 1 = 1$$\nSubstituting these along with $C_{WL} = 200 \\ \\text{fF}$ and $C_{\\text{budget}} = 15 \\ \\text{fF}$:\n$$C_{\\text{in},2}^{\\star} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(1) \\times (200 \\ \\text{fF}) \\times (15 \\ \\text{fF})}{20}}$$\n$$C_{\\text{in},2}^{\\star} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3000}{20}} \\ \\text{fF} = \\sqrt{150} \\ \\text{fF}$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$C_{\\text{in},2}^{\\star} \\approx 12.2474487 \\ \\text{fF}$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final values to four significant figures.\n$$C_{\\text{in},1}^{\\star} = 15.00 \\ \\text{fF}$$\n$$C_{\\text{in},2}^{\\star} = 12.25 \\ \\text{fF}$$\nThe optimal sizing distribution is specified by these two capacitance values.",

It requires a standard application of circuit theory and device physics principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum quasi-static voltage rise, $V_{Q,\\max}$, on an SRAM storage node, let's call it node $Q$, which is initially at a logic $0$ (voltage $V_Q = 0$). During a read operation, the wordline is asserted to $V_{DD}$, turning on the NMOS access transistor, $M_{\\text{ax}}$. This transistor connects node $Q$ to the bitline, which is held at $V_{DD}$. Concurrently, the pull-down NMOS transistor, $M_{\\text{pd}}$, of the inverter storing the logic $0$ is also on, because its gate is connected to the complementary storage node holding a logic $1$ (voltage $V_{DD}$).\n\nA quasi-static equilibrium voltage $V_{Q,\\max}$ is reached when the current supplied to node $Q$ by the access transistor, $I_{\\text{ax}}$, is exactly balanced by the current sunk from node $Q$ by the pull-down transistor, $I_{\\text{pd}}$. This is an application of Kirchhoff's Current Law at node $Q$, where the net current into the node capacitance is zero, i.e., $I_{\\text{ax}} - I_{\\text{pd}} = I_{C_{\\text{node}}} = C_{\\text{node}} \\frac{dV_Q}{dt} = 0$. Thus, the value of the capacitance $C_{\\text{node}}$ affects the time taken to reach this voltage but does not determine the final quasi-static value $V_{Q,\\max}$. The governing equation is:\n$$I_{\\text{ax}} = I_{\\text{pd}}$$\n\nTo solve this, we must first establish the operating regions for both transistors at the point where $V_Q = V_{Q,\\max}$.\n\n**Transistor $M_{\\text{pd}}$ (Pull-down):**\n-   Gate voltage: $V_{G,\\text{pd}} = V_{DD}$ (from the complementary node).\n-   Source voltage: $V_{S,\\text{pd}} = 0$ (connected to ground).\n-   Drain voltage: $V_{D,\\text{pd}} = V_Q$.\nTherefore, $V_{GS,\\text{pd}} = V_{DD}$ and $V_{DS,\\text{pd}} = V_Q$.\nFor stable SRAM operation, the read disturb voltage $V_Q$ must be small, and certainly less than the threshold voltage $V_{Tn}$ of the other inverter in the cell. This voltage rise must not be large enough to flip the cell's state. We can thus assume that $V_Q$ is small, which implies $V_{DS,\\text{pd}} < V_{GS,\\text{pd}} - V_{Tn}$, or $V_Q < V_{DD} - V_{Tn}$. Under this valid assumption, the pull-down transistor $M_{\\text{pd}}$ operates in the **linear (triode) region**.\n\n**Transistor $M_{\\text{ax}}$ (Access):**\n-   Gate voltage: $V_{G,\\text{ax}} = V_{DD}$ (from the wordline).\n-   Source voltage: $V_{S,\\text{ax}} = V_Q$ (connected to the storage node).\n-   Drain voltage: $V_{D,\\text{ax}} = V_{DD}$ (connected to the bitline).\nTherefore, $V_{GS,\\text{ax}} = V_{DD} - V_Q$ and $V_{DS,\\text{ax}} = V_{DD} - V_Q$.\nThe condition for saturation is $V_{DS,\\text{ax}} \\ge V_{GS,\\text{ax}} - V_{Tn}$. Substituting the voltages, we get $V_{DD} - V_Q \\ge (V_{DD} - V_Q) - V_{Tn}$, which simplifies to $0 \\ge -V_{Tn}$, or $V_{Tn} \\ge 0$. As $V_{Tn}$ for an enhancement-mode NMOS is positive, this condition is always met. Thus, the access transistor $M_{\\text{ax}}$ operates in the **saturation region**, provided it is turned on ($V_{GS,\\text{ax}} > V_{Tn}$, or $V_Q < V_{DD} - V_{Tn}$). This condition is consistent with the assumption for $M_{\\text{pd}}$ being in the linear region.\n\nNow we write the long-channel drain current equations for each transistor, with channel-length modulation being negligible ($\\lambda=0$).\nThe current for $M_{\\text{pd}}$ in the linear region is:\n$$I_{\\text{pd}} = k_n \\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)_{\\text{pd}} \\left[ (V_{GS,\\text{pd}} - V_{Tn})V_{DS,\\text{pd}} - \\frac{1}{2}V_{DS,\\text{pd}}^2 \\right]$$\nSubstituting the voltages at $V_Q = V_{Q,\\max}$:\n$$I_{\\text{pd}} = k_n \\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)_{\\text{pd}} \\left[ (V_{DD} - V_{Tn})V_{Q,\\max} - \\frac{1}{2}V_{Q,\\max}^2 \\right]$$\n\nThe current for $M_{\\text{ax}}$ in the saturation region is:\n$$I_{\\text{ax}} = \\frac{1}{2} k_n \\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)_{\\text{ax}} (V_{GS,\\text{ax}} - V_{Tn})^2$$\nSubstituting the voltages at $V_Q = V_{Q,\\max}$:\n$$I_{\\text{ax}} = \\frac{1}{2} k_n \\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)_{\\text{ax}} (V_{DD} - V_{Q,\\max} - V_{Tn})^2$$\n\nEquating the two currents, $I_{\\text{pd}} = I_{\\text{ax}}$:\n$$k_n \\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)_{\\text{pd}} \\left[ (V_{DD} - V_{Tn})V_{Q,\\max} - \\frac{1}{2}V_{Q,\\max}^2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} k_n \\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)_{\\text{ax}} (V_{DD} - V_{Q,\\max} - V_{Tn})^2$$\n\nWe can cancel the common factor $k_n$ and use the definition $\\beta = (\\frac{W}{L})_{\\text{pd}} / (\\frac{W}{L})_{\\text{ax}}$:\n$$\\beta \\left[ (V_{DD} - V_{Tn})V_{Q,\\max} - \\frac{1}{2}V_{Q,\\max}^2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} (V_{DD} - V_{Q,\\max} - V_{Tn})^2$$\n\nTo solve for $V_{Q,\\max}$, we expand and rearrange the equation. First, multiply by $2$:\n$$2\\beta (V_{DD} - V_{Tn})V_{Q,\\max} - \\beta V_{Q,\\max}^2 = (V_{DD} - V_{Tn} - V_{Q,\\max})^2$$\n$$2\\beta (V_{DD} - V_{Tn})V_{Q,\\max} - \\beta V_{Q,\\max}^2 = (V_{DD} - V_{Tn})^2 - 2(V_{DD} - V_{Tn})V_{Q,\\max} + V_{Q,\\max}^2$$\n\nNow, we collect terms to form a quadratic equation in $V_{Q,\\max}$: $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $x=V_{Q,\\max}$.\n$$ (1+\\beta)V_{Q,\\max}^2 - 2(V_{DD} - V_{Tn})V_{Q,\\max} - 2\\beta (V_{DD} - V_{Tn})V_{Q,\\max} + (V_{DD} - V_{Tn})^2 = 0 $$\n$$ (1+\\beta)V_{Q,\\max}^2 - 2(1+\\beta)(V_{DD} - V_{Tn})V_{Q,\\max} + (V_{DD} - V_{Tn})^2 = 0 $$\n\nWe solve this quadratic equation using the formula $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n-   $a = 1+\\beta$\n-   $b = -2(1+\\beta)(V_{DD} - V_{Tn})$\n-   $c = (V_{DD} - V_{Tn})^2$\n\nThe discriminant is:\n$$ b^2 - 4ac = [-2(1+\\beta)(V_{DD} - V_{Tn})]^2 - 4(1+\\beta)(V_{DD} - V_{Tn})^2 $$\n$$ b^2 - 4ac = 4(1+\\beta)^2(V_{DD} - V_{Tn})^2 - 4(1+\\beta)(V_{DD} - V_{Tn})^2 $$\n$$ b^2 - 4ac = 4(V_{DD} - V_{Tn})^2 [(1+\\beta)^2 - (1+\\beta)] $$\n$$ b^2 - 4ac = 4(V_{DD} - V_{Tn})^2 (1+\\beta) [1+\\beta - 1] $$\n$$ b^2 - 4ac = 4\\beta(1+\\beta)(V_{DD} - V_{Tn})^2 $$\n\nThe solution for $V_{Q,\\max}$ is:\n$$ V_{Q,\\max} = \\frac{2(1+\\beta)(V_{DD} - V_{Tn}) \\pm \\sqrt{4\\beta(1+\\beta)(V_{DD} - V_{Tn})^2}}{2(1+\\beta)} $$\n$$ V_{Q,\\max} = \\frac{2(1+\\beta)(V_{DD} - V_{Tn}) \\pm 2(V_{DD} - V_{Tn})\\sqrt{\\beta(1+\\beta)}}{2(1+\\beta)} $$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $2(1+\\beta)$:\n$$ V_{Q,\\max} = (V_{DD} - V_{Tn}) \\left[ \\frac{1+\\beta \\pm \\sqrt{\\beta(1+\\beta)}}{1+\\beta} \\right] $$\n$$ V_{Q,\\max} = (V_{DD} - V_{Tn}) \\left[ 1 \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{\\beta(1+\\beta)}}{1+\\beta} \\right] $$\n$$ V_{Q,\\max} = (V_{DD} - V_{Tn}) \\left[ 1 \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta(1+\\beta)}{(1+\\beta)^2}} \\right] $$\n$$ V_{Q,\\max} = (V_{DD} - V_{Tn}) \\left( 1 \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta}{1+\\beta}} \\right) $$\n\nWe must choose the physically correct root. The node voltage $V_Q$ starts at $0$ and rises. The voltage $V_{Q,\\max}$ must be the smaller of the two solutions. The solution with the `+` sign would yield $V_{Q,\\max} > V_{DD} - V_{Tn}$, which violates the operating region assumption and is not the stable state reached from $V_Q=0$. The physically meaningful solution corresponds to the `-` sign, which gives a voltage smaller than $V_{DD} - V_{Tn}$ (since $\\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta}{1+\\beta}} < 1$ for $\\beta > 0$) and is consistent with our initial assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the maximum quasi-static read disturb voltage is:\n$$ V_{Q,\\max} = (V_{DD} - V_{Tn}) \\left( 1 - \\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta}{1+\\beta}} \\right) $$",
