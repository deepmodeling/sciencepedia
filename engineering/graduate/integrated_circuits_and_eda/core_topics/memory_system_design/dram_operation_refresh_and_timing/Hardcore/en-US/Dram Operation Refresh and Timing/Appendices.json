            "problem": "Consider a Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM) row activation timing constraint in the context of Integrated Circuits and Electronic Design Automation (EDA). The minimum row active time $t_{\\text{RAS}}$ must satisfy two independent physical requirements: (i) full restoration of the accessed cell charge through the pass transistor and sense amplifier drive path, and (ii) sufficient internal preparation for precharge by ensuring the wordline has decayed below the pass-transistor cutoff threshold. Using only the canonical first-order resistor-capacitor (RC) exponential charging/discharging law and well-tested semiconductor mobility and threshold-voltage temperature dependencies, derive a lower bound on $t_{\\text{RAS}}$ imposed by full cell restoration and a separate lower bound imposed by internal precharge preparation.

The parameters and models provided are consistent with standard engineering practice in integrated circuit design and analysis. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the minimum safe row active time, $t_{\\text{RAS,min}}(T)$, which is defined as the sum of two components: the time for full cell restoration, $t_{\\text{restore}}(T)$, and the time for internal precharge preparation, $t_{\\text{prep}}(T)$. We will derive the analytical expressions for each component and then compute their numerical values at the specified temperatures.\n\n1. Derivation of the cell restoration time, $t_{\\text{restore}}(T)$.\n\nThe restoration of a DRAM cell's charge is modeled as a first-order Resistor-Capacitor (RC) charging process. The cell capacitor, with capacitance $C_{\\text{cell}}$, charges through the pass-transistor's on-resistance, $R_{\\text{pass}}(T)$, towards the supply voltage, $V_{\\text{DD}}$. The voltage on the cell capacitor, $V_{\\text{cell}}(t)$, is described by the differential equation's solution:\n$$V_{\\text{cell}}(t) = V_{\\text{final}} + (V_{\\text{initial}} - V_{\\text{final}})\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\text{restore}}}\\right)$$\nHere, the time constant is $\\tau_{\\text{restore}}(T) = R_{\\text{pass}}(T)C_{\\text{cell}}$. The final voltage is the supply rail, $V_{\\text{final}} = V_{\\text{DD}}$. The initial voltage is given as $V_{\\text{initial}} = V_{\\text{cell}}(0) = \\frac{1}{2}V_{\\text{DD}}$. Substituting these values:\n$$V_{\\text{cell}}(t) = V_{\\text{DD}} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}V_{\\text{DD}} - V_{\\text{DD}}\\right)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\text{restore}}}\\right) = V_{\\text{DD}}\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\text{restore}}}\\right)\\right)$$\nThe restoration is considered complete when the voltage reaches $V_{\\text{DD}} - V_{\\text{margin}}$. We denote the time to reach this voltage as $t_{\\text{restore}}$. Setting $V_{\\text{cell}}(t_{\\text{restore}}) = V_{\\text{DD}} - V_{\\text{margin}}$:\n$$V_{\\text{DD}} - V_{\\text{margin}} = V_{\\text{DD}}\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\text{restore}}}{\\tau_{\\text{restore}}}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$-V_{\\text{margin}} = -\\frac{V_{\\text{DD}}}{2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\text{restore}}}{\\tau_{\\text{restore}}}\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{2V_{\\text{margin}}}{V_{\\text{DD}}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\text{restore}}}{\\tau_{\\text{restore}}}\\right)$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides and solving for $t_{\\text{restore}}$:\n$$t_{\\text{restore}} = -\\tau_{\\text{restore}}\\ln\\left(\\frac{2V_{\\text{margin}}}{V_{\\text{DD}}}\\right) = \\tau_{\\text{restore}}\\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{\\text{DD}}}{2V_{\\text{margin}}}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the given temperature-dependent model for the resistance, $R_{\\text{pass}}(T)=R_{\\text{pass},0}\\left(\\frac{T}{300\\ \\text{K}}\\right)^{m}$, the full expression for $t_{\\text{restore}}(T)$ is:\n$$t_{\\text{restore}}(T) = R_{\\text{pass},0}C_{\\text{cell}}\\left(\\frac{T}{300\\ \\text{K}}\\right)^{m} \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{\\text{DD}}}{2V_{\\text{margin}}}\\right)$$\n\n2. Derivation of the precharge preparation time, $t_{\\text{prep}}(T)$.\n\nThe preparation for precharge requires the wordline voltage, $V_{\\text{WL}}$, to decay below a certain threshold. This is modeled as a first-order RC discharging process. The wordline capacitance, $C_{\\text{WL}}$, discharges through the driver resistance, $R_{\\text{drv}}(T)$. The voltage decay from an initial value of $V_{\\text{DD}}$ towards $0\\ \\text{V}$ is given by:\n$$V_{\\text{WL}}(t) = V_{\\text{DD}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\text{prep}}}\\right)$$\nThe time constant is $\\tau_{\\text{prep}}(T) = R_{\\text{drv}}(T)C_{\\text{WL}}$. The condition for precharge preparation is that $V_{\\text{WL}}$ must fall below the pass-transistor's cutoff threshold, $V_{\\text{th}}(T)$. We solve for the time $t_{\\text{prep}}$ at which $V_{\\text{WL}}(t_{\\text{prep}}) = V_{\\text{th}}(T)$:\n$$V_{\\text{th}}(T) = V_{\\text{DD}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\text{prep}}}{\\tau_{\\text{prep}}}\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{V_{\\text{th}}(T)}{V_{\\text{DD}}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\text{prep}}}{\\tau_{\\text{prep}}}\\right)$$\nTaking the natural logarithm and solving for $t_{\\text{prep}}$:\n$$t_{\\text{prep}} = -\\tau_{\\text{prep}}\\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{\\text{th}}(T)}{V_{\\text{DD}}}\\right) = \\tau_{\\text{prep}}\\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{\\text{DD}}}{V_{\\text{th}}(T)}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the models for $R_{\\text{drv}}(T)=R_{\\text{drv},0}\\left(\\frac{T}{300\\ \\text{K}}\\right)^{m}$ and $V_{\\text{th}}(T)=V_{\\text{th},0}-k_{T}\\left(T-300\\ \\text{K}}\\right)$:\n$$t_{\\text{prep}}(T) = R_{\\text{drv},0}C_{\\text{WL}}\\left(\\frac{T}{300\\ \\text{K}}\\right)^{m} \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{\\text{DD}}}{V_{\\text{th},0}-k_{T}(T-300\\ \\text{K})}\\right)$$\n\n3. Numerical Computation.\n\nThe total minimum safe row active time is $t_{\\text{RAS,min}}(T) = t_{\\text{restore}}(T) + t_{\\text{prep}}(T)$. We will use the given parameter values: $V_{\\text{DD}}=1.2\\ \\text{V}$, $V_{\\text{margin}}=0.02\\ \\text{V}$, $C_{\\text{cell}}=30\\ \\text{fF} = 30 \\times 10^{-15}\\ \\text{F}$, $R_{\\text{pass},0}=8\\ \\text{k}\\Omega = 8 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\Omega$, $C_{\\text{WL}}=1.5\\ \\text{pF} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\text{F}$, $R_{\\text{drv},0}=2\\ \\text{k}\\Omega = 2 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\Omega$, $m=1.5$, $V_{\\text{th},0}=0.30\\ \\text{V}$, and $k_{T}=0.001\\ \\text{V/K}$.\n\nCalculation at $T_{\\text{low}}=273\\ \\text{K}$:\nFirst, calculate the temperature-dependent terms.\n$\\left(\\frac{T_{\\text{low}}}{300\\ \\text{K}}\\right)^m = \\left(\\frac{273}{300}\\right)^{1.5} = (0.91)^{1.5} \\approx 0.86927$.\n$V_{\\text{th}}(T_{\\text{low}}) = 0.30\\ \\text{V} - (0.001\\ \\text{V/K})(273\\ \\text{K} - 300\\ \\text{K}) = 0.30\\ \\text{V} + 0.027\\ \\text{V} = 0.327\\ \\text{V}$.\nNow, compute each time component.\n$$t_{\\text{restore}}(273\\ \\text{K}) = (8 \\times 10^3\\ \\Omega)(30 \\times 10^{-15}\\ \\text{F})(0.86927) \\ln\\left(\\frac{1.2}{2 \\times 0.02}\\right) \\approx 0.7095 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{s}$$\n$$t_{\\text{prep}}(273\\ \\text{K}) = (2 \\times 10^3\\ \\Omega)(1.5 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\text{F})(0.86927) \\ln\\left(\\frac{1.2}{0.327}\\right) \\approx 3.3905 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{s}$$\nThe total time is:\n$$t_{\\text{RAS,min}}(273\\ \\text{K}) = (0.7095 + 3.3905) \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{s} = 4.100 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{s} = 4.10\\ \\text{ns}$$\n\nCalculation at $T_{\\text{high}}=358\\ \\text{K}$:\nFirst, calculate the temperature-dependent terms.\n$\\left(\\frac{T_{\\text{high}}}{300\\ \\text{K}}\\right)^m = \\left(\\frac{358}{300}\\right)^{1.5} \\approx (1.19333)^{1.5} \\approx 1.30349$.\n$V_{\\text{th}}(T_{\\text{high}}) = 0.30\\ \\text{V} - (0.001\\ \\text{V/K})(358\\ \\text{K} - 300\\ \\text{K}) = 0.30\\ \\text{V} - 0.058\\ \\text{V} = 0.242\\ \\text{V}$.\nNow, compute each time component.\n$$t_{\\text{restore}}(358\\ \\text{K}) = (8 \\times 10^3\\ \\Omega)(30 \\times 10^{-15}\\ \\text{F})(1.30349) \\ln(30) \\approx 1.0642 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{s}$$\n$$t_{\\text{prep}}(358\\ \\text{K}) = (2 \\times 10^3\\ \\Omega)(1.5 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\text{F})(1.30349) \\ln\\left(\\frac{1.2}{0.242}\\right) \\approx 6.2612 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{s}$$\nThe total time is:\n$$t_{\\text{RAS,min}}(358\\ \\text{K}) = (1.0642 + 6.2612) \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{s} = 7.3254 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{s} \\approx 7.33\\ \\text{ns}$$\n\nThe requested values for $t_{\\text{RAS,min}}(T)$ at $T_{\\text{low}}=273\\ \\text{K}$ and $T_{\\text{high}}=358\\ \\text{K}$, rounded to three significant figures, are $4.10\\ \\text{ns}$ and $7.33\\ \\text{ns}$, respectively.",

A burst of length $BL$ occupies the bus for $BL$ symbols, where the symbol period is the reciprocal of the data transfer rate $f$. The minimum column-to-column command spacing time $t_{\\text{CCD}}$ must be chosen to prevent overlap of data bursts on the DQ bus (bus contention) and must also respect the internal timing required for the column select multiplexer to settle and the sense amplifier shared I/O path to be re-driven for consecutive column accesses within the same open row.\n\nAssume two consecutive read column commands target the same rank and the same open row, and that other rank/bus turnaround constraints are not limiting.

The parameters like data rate, burst length, and internal timings ($t_{\\text{CCD}}$, $t_{\\text{mux}}$, $t_{\\text{sa}}$) are standard JEDEC-defined specifications. The numerical values provided are realistic for contemporary DDR memory families (e.g., DDR4-3200). The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem sets up a clear objective: to find the minimum $t_{CCD}$ as determined by the tighter of two specified constraints. All necessary data are provided, and the constraints are clearly defined. A unique, stable, and meaningful solution can be derived.\n- **Objective**: The problem is formulated using precise, technical language devoid of subjectivity or bias.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the problem is free of scientific flaws, ambiguities, or contradictions. It is deemed **valid**.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. The solution process will now proceed.\n\nThe minimum column-to-column command spacing time, $t_{\\text{CCD}}$, is the minimum time interval required between two consecutive column-level commands (e.g., READ or WRITE) to the same open row in a DRAM device. Its value is determined by the most restrictive of all relevant timing constraints. The problem specifies two such constraints that must be satisfied simultaneously. Therefore, the minimum $t_{\\text{CCD}}$ will be the maximum of the minimum times required by each individual constraint.\n\nLet's analyze each constraint separately.\n\n**Constraint 1: Bus Contention Avoidance**\nFor two consecutive read commands, the data bursts they trigger must not overlap on the shared DQ bus. The first command initiates a data burst of a certain duration. The second command can only be issued after a time $t_{\\text{CCD}}$ such that its resulting data burst begins on the bus no earlier than when the first data burst has completed.\n\nThe duration of a single data burst, $t_{\\text{burst}}$, is given by the burst length ($BL$) divided by the data transfer rate ($f$).\n$$t_{\\text{burst}} = \\frac{BL}{f}$$\nThis represents the time the bus is occupied by one burst transaction. For back-to-back transactions without idle time, the start of the second burst must be separated from the start of the first burst by at least $t_{\\text{burst}}$. Assuming a constant latency between command issuance and data appearance on the bus, the time separation between the commands themselves, $t_{\\text{CCD}}$, must also be at least this duration. Let's denote this minimum time required by the bus constraint as $T_{\\text{bus}}$.\n$$T_{\\text{bus}} = t_{\\text{burst}} = \\frac{BL}{f}$$\nTherefore, the first constraint on $t_{\\text{CCD}}$ is:\n$$t_{\\text{CCD}} \\ge \\frac{BL}{f}$$\n\n**Constraint 2: Internal Device Timing**\nThe problem states that consecutive column accesses within the same open row require a minimum time to allow for internal circuit operations to complete. These operations are the column address multiplexer settling ($t_{\\text{mux}}$) and the subsequent re-driving of the shared sense amplifier I/O path ($t_{\\text{sa}}$). These are sequential events that must occur before the DRAM core is ready to process the next column access.\n\nThe total minimum time required for these internal operations, which we denote as $T_{\\text{internal}}$, is the sum of the individual times.\n$$T_{\\text{internal}} = t_{\\text{mux}} + t_{\\text{sa}}$$\nThus, the second constraint on $t_{\\text{CCD}}$ is:\n$$t_{\\text{CCD}} \\ge t_{\\text{mux}} + t_{\\text{sa}}$$\n\n**Determining the Minimum $t_{\\text{CCD}}$**\nTo ensure both constraints are met, $t_{\\text{CCD}}$ must be greater than or equal to both $T_{\\text{bus}}$ and $T_{\\text{internal}}$. The minimum possible value for $t_{\\text{CCD}}$ is therefore the maximum of these two lower bounds.\n$$t_{\\text{CCD, min}} = \\max\\left(T_{\\text{bus}}, T_{\\text{internal}}\\right) = \\max\\left(\\frac{BL}{f}, t_{\\text{mux}} + t_{\\text{sa}}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values to compute the solution. The parameters are:\n- $BL = 8$\n- $f = 3.2 \\times 10^{9} \\text{ s}^{-1}$\n- $t_{\\text{mux}} = 0.7 \\text{ ns} = 0.7 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ s}$\n- $t_{\\text{sa}} = 1.6 \\text{ ns} = 1.6 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ s}$\n\nFirst, we calculate $T_{\\text{bus}}$:\n$$T_{\\text{bus}} = \\frac{8}{3.2 \\times 10^{9} \\text{ s}^{-1}} = \\frac{8}{3.2} \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ s} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ s}$$\n\nNext, we calculate $T_{\\text{internal}}$:\n$$T_{\\text{internal}} = (0.7 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ s}) + (1.6 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ s}) = 2.3 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ s}$$\n\nFinally, we find the minimum $t_{\\text{CCD}}$ by taking the maximum of these two values:\n$$t_{\\text{CCD, min}} = \\max(2.5 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ s}, 2.3 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ s}) = 2.5 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ s}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer in nanoseconds.\n$$t_{\\text{CCD, min}} = 2.5 \\text{ ns}$$\n\nThe problem also specifies rounding the answer to four significant figures.\n$$t_{\\text{CCD, min}} = 2.500 \\text{ ns}$$\nThe bus contention constraint ($2.5 \\text{ ns}$) is more restrictive than the internal timing constraint ($2.3 \\text{ ns}$), and therefore dictates the minimum permissible value for $t_{\\text{CCD}}$.",

Let $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_8$ be the nodes representing the eight activate commands.\n\nThe command sequence targets the following (Bank Group, Bank) pairs:\n$v_1: (\\mathrm{BG}\\,0, \\mathrm{bank}\\,0)$\n$v_2: (\\mathrm{BG}\\,0, \\mathrm{bank}\\,1)$\n$v_3: (\\mathrm{BG}\\,1, \\mathrm{bank}\\,2)$\n$v_4: (\\mathrm{BG}\\,1, \\mathrm{bank}\\,3)$\n$v_5: (\\mathrm{BG}\\,2, \\mathrm{bank}\\,1)$\n$v_6: (\\mathrm{BG}\\,2, \\mathrm{bank}\\,2)$\n$v_7: (\\mathrm{BG}\\,3, \\mathrm{bank}\\,0)$\n$v_8: (\\mathrm{BG}\\,3, \\mathrm{bank}\\,1)$\n\nThe constraints are as follows:\n\n1.  **Consecutive $t_{\\text{RRD}}$ constraints (lag $L=0$):**\n    *   $v_1 \\to v_2$: Same BG, weight $w_{12} = t_{\\text{RRD_S}} = 3\\,t_{\\text{CK}}$.\n    *   $v_2 \\to v_3$: Different BGs, weight $w_{23} = t_{\\text{RRD_L}} = 4\\,t_{\\text{CK}}$.\n    *   $v_3 \\to v_4$: Same BG, weight $w_{34} = t_{\\text{RRD_S}} = 3\\,t_{\\text{CK}}$.\n    *   $v_4 \\to v_5$: Different BGs, weight $w_{45} = t_{\\text{RRD_L}} = 4\\,t_{\\text{CK}}$.\n    *   $v_5 \\to v_6$: Same BG, weight $w_{56} = t_{\\text{RRD_S}} = 3\\,t_{\\text{CK}}$.\n    *   $v_6 \\to v_7$: Different BGs, weight $w_{67} = t_{\\text{RRD_L}} = 4\\,t_{\\text{CK}}$.\n    *   $v_7 \\to v_8$: Same BG, weight $w_{78} = t_{\\text{RRD_S}} = 3\\,t_{\\text{CK}}$.\n\n2.  **$t_{\\text{FAW}}$ constraints (lag $L=0$):**\n    *   $v_1 \\to v_5$: weight $t_{\\text{FAW}} = 16\\,t_{\\text{CK}}$.\n    *   $v_2 \\to v_6$: weight $t_{\\text{FAW}} = 16\\,t_{\\text{CK}}$.\n    *   $v_3 \\to v_7$: weight $t_{\\text{FAW}} = 16\\,t_{\\text{CK}}$.\n    *   $v_4 \\to v_8$: weight $t_{\\text{FAW}} = 16\\,t_{\\text{CK}}$.\n\n3.  **Wrap-around constraints (lag $L=1$):**\n    *   $t_{\\text{RRD}}$ from $v_8$ to $v_1$ of the next cycle. They are in different bank groups. This gives an edge $v_8 \\to v_1$ with weight $t_{\\text{RRD_L}} = 4\\,t_{\\text{CK}}$ and lag $L=1$.\n    *   $t_{\\text{FAW}}$ constraints spanning the sequence boundary.\n        *   $v_5 \\to v_1'$ (next cycle): edge $v_5 \\to v_1$ with weight $t_{\\text{FAW}} = 16\\,t_{\\text{CK}}$ and lag $L=1$.\n        *   $v_6 \\to v_2'$ (next cycle): edge $v_6 \\to v_2$ with weight $t_{\\text{FAW}} = 16\\,t_{\\text{CK}}$ and lag $L=1$.\n        *   $v_7 \\to v_3'$ (next cycle): edge $v_7 \\to v_3$ with weight $t_{\\text{FAW}} = 16\\,t_{\\text{CK}}$ and lag $L=1$.\n        *   $v_8 \\to v_4'$ (next cycle): edge $v_8 \\to v_4$ with weight $t_{\\text{FAW}} = 16\\,t_{\\text{CK}}$ and lag $L=1$.\n\nNow, we must find the cycle with the maximum ratio. Let's analyze the critical cycles. The longest path from one node to another within a period (lag 0) is found using standard longest-path algorithms on the acyclic graph of intra-period constraints.\nLet's calculate the longest path lengths from $v_1$ (assuming $t_1=0$):\n$L(1,1) = 0$\n$L(1,2) = w_{12} = 3\\,t_{\\text{CK}}$\n$L(1,3) = L(1,2) + w_{23} = 3\\,t_{\\text{CK}} + 4\\,t_{\\text{CK}} = 7\\,t_{\\text{CK}}$\n$L(1,4) = L(1,3) + w_{34} = 7\\,t_{\\text{CK}} + 3\\,t_{\\text{CK}} = 10\\,t_{\\text{CK}}$\n$L(1,5) = \\max(L(1,4) + w_{45}, L(1,1)+w_{15}) = \\max(10+4, 16)\\,t_{\\text{CK}} = 16\\,t_{\\text{CK}}$\n$L(1,6) = \\max(L(1,5) + w_{56}, L(1,2)+w_{26}) = \\max(16+3, 3+16)\\,t_{\\text{CK}} = 19\\,t_{\\text{CK}}$\n$L(1,7) = \\max(L(1,6) + w_{67}, L(1,3)+w_{37}) = \\max(19+4, 7+16)\\,t_{\\text{CK}} = 23\\,t_{\\text{CK}}$\n$L(1,8) = \\max(L(1,7) + w_{78}, L(1,4)+w_{48}) = \\max(23+3, 10+16)\\,t_{\\text{CK}} = 26\\,t_{\\text{CK}}$\n\nWe evaluate the cycle ratios for the critical cycles that cross the period boundary (lag $L=1$).\n**Cycle A: The main $t_{\\text{RRD}}$ loop.**\nThis cycle consists of the path $v_1 \\to \\dots \\to v_8$ and the wrap-around edge $v_8 \\to v_1$. The total weight is the longest path from $v_1$ to $v_8$, $L(1,8)$, plus the weight of the wrap-around edge $w_{8,1,\\text{wrap}}$.\n$$ \\lambda_A = \\frac{L(1,8) + w_{8,1,\\text{wrap}}}{1} = \\frac{26\\,t_{\\text{CK}} + 4\\,t_{\\text{CK}}}{1} = 30\\,t_{\\text{CK}} $$\n\n**Cycle B: The $t_{\\text{FAW}}$ loops.**\nThese are cycles formed by a path $v_i \\to v_{i+4}$ and a wrap-around edge $v_{i+4} \\to v_i$. Each has a lag $L=1$. We calculate the ratio for each.\nThe path from $v_i$ to $v_{i+4}$ has weight $L(i,i+4)$, and the wrap-around edge $v_{i+4} \\to v_i'$ has weight $t_{\\text{FAW}}$.\n* For $i=1$: The cycle is $v_1 \\to v_5 \\to v_1'$. $L(1,5) = 16\\,t_{\\text{CK}}$.\n  $$ \\lambda_{B1} = \\frac{L(1,5) + t_{\\text{FAW}}}{1} = \\frac{16\\,t_{\\text{CK}} + 16\\,t_{\\text{CK}}}{1} = 32\\,t_{\\text{CK}} $$\n* The path $v_i \\to \\dots \\to v_{i+4}$ following the sequential $t_{\\text{RRD}}$ constraints has a total weight of $14\\,t_{\\text{CK}}$ in each case (e.g., for $i=2$, $w_{23}+w_{34}+w_{45}+w_{56}=4+3+4+3=14$). Since $t_{\\text{FAW}} = 16\\,t_{\\text{CK}} > 14\\,t_{\\text{CK}}$, the longest path $L(i, i+4)$ will always be dominated by the direct $t_{\\text{FAW}}$ edge, giving $L(i, i+4) = 16\\,t_{\\text{CK}}$ for $i \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$.\n* Thus, all four of these $t_{\\text{FAW}}$ cycles have the same ratio:\n  $$ \\lambda_{B_i} = \\frac{16\\,t_{\\text{CK}} + 16\\,t_{\\text{CK}}}{1} = 32\\,t_{\\text{CK}} $$\n\nThe minimum period is the maximum of these cycle ratios:\n$$ T_{\\text{period, min}} = \\max(\\lambda_A, \\lambda_{B1}, \\dots, \\lambda_{B4}) = \\max(30\\,t_{\\text{CK}}, 32\\,t_{\\text{CK}}) = 32\\,t_{\\text{CK}} $$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value of the period:\n$$ T_{\\text{period, min}} = 32 \\times 0.625\\,\\mathrm{ns} = 32 \\times \\frac{5}{8}\\,\\mathrm{ns} = 20\\,\\mathrm{ns} = 20 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{s} $$\nThe activation rate is the number of activations per period (8) divided by the minimum period time.\n$$ \\text{Rate} = \\frac{8}{T_{\\text{period, min}}} = \\frac{8}{20 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{s}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 4 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nRounding to 4 significant figures, the final answer is:\n$$ \\text{Rate} = 4.000 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$",
