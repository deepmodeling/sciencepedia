            "problem": "Consider a Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) bitline pair operating in a modern Electronic Design Automation (EDA) sign-off flow. Each bitline is modeled as a capacitor of value $C_{BL}$ connected to a dedicated on-chip mid-rail reference $V_{PC} = V_{DD}/2$ through a transmission gate composed of an $n$-channel metal-oxide-semiconductor (NMOS) transistor in parallel with a $p$-channel metal-oxide-semiconductor (PMOS) transistor. A separate equalization NMOS shorts the two bitlines during precharge. Assume that after a worst-case access, the bitlines are at $V_{BL}(0) = V_{DD}$ and $V_{\\overline{BL}}(0) = 0$, and the precharge control turns on the transmission gates and the equalizer. The goal of precharge is to bring both bitlines to $V_{PC}$ within a tolerance band $\\pm \\delta$.\n\nUse the following scientifically standard approximations and data:\n- The precharge NMOS and PMOS transistors operate in the linear region with small-signal conductances $g_{n} = \\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W_{n}}{L_{n}} \\left(V_{GS,n} - V_{TH,n}\\right)$ and $g_{p} = \\mu_{p} C_{ox} \\frac{W_{p}}{L_{p}} \\left(V_{SG,p} - |V_{TH,p}|\\right)$, respectively, valid for $V_{GS,n} > V_{TH,n}$ and $V_{SG,p} > |V_{TH,p}|$. Neglect body effect, velocity saturation, channel-length modulation, and any dependence of $\\mu$ or $C_{ox}$ on bias.\n- During precharge, the gates are driven to $V_{G,n} = V_{DD}$ and $V_{G,p} = 0$. For the purpose of estimating the time constant, take the overdrive biases at the mid-rail operating point as $V_{GS,n} \\approx V_{DD}/2$ and $V_{SG,p} \\approx V_{DD}/2$.\n- The equalization device is sufficiently strong that the differential-mode voltage between the two bitlines decays much faster than the common-mode movement toward $V_{PC}$; thus the precharge settling to $V_{PC}$ can be analyzed as two identical first-order $RC$ relaxations, one for each bitline, governed by the equivalent conductance $g_{eq} = g_{n} + g_{p}$ to $V_{PC}$.\n\nGiven parameters:\n- $C_{BL} = 400 \\,\\text{fF}$,\n- $\\mu_{n} C_{ox} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\,\\text{A}/\\text{V}^{2}$, $\\mu_{p} C_{ox} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-4} \\,\\text{A}/\\text{V}^{2}$,\n- $W_{n} = 0.50 \\,\\mu\\text{m}$, $L_{n} = 0.06 \\,\\mu\\text{m}$, $W_{p} = 1.00 \\,\\mu\\text{m}$, $L_{p} = 0.06 \\,\\mu\\text{m}$,\n- $V_{TH,n} = 0.35 \\,\\text{V}$, $V_{TH,p} = -0.35 \\,\\text{V}$,\n- $V_{DD} = 1.0 \\,\\text{V}$,\n- $\\delta = 5.0 \\,\\text{mV}$.\n\nStarting from first principles of first-order $RC$ transients and the linear-region small-signal conductance of MOS transistors, derive an analytic expression for the precharge time $t_{\\text{RP}}$ required such that both bitlines satisfy $|V(t_{\\text{RP}}) - V_{PC}| \\le \\delta$ under the stated worst-case initial condition. Then, evaluate $t_{\\text{RP}}$ numerically for the given parameters and express your numerical answer in nanoseconds, rounding to three significant figures.\n\nFurther, determine how $t_{\\text{RP}}$ scales with the supply voltage $V_{DD}$ by deriving a closed-form expression $t_{\\text{RP}}(V_{DD})$ under the same modeling assumptions, explicitly showing its dependence on $V_{DD}$, $C_{BL}$, $\\mu_{n} C_{ox}$, $\\mu_{p} C_{ox}$, $\\frac{W_{n}}{L_{n}}$, $\\frac{W_{p}}{L_{p}}$, $V_{TH,n}$, $|V_{TH,p}|$, and $\\delta$.

It is well-posed, providing a complete set of consistent parameters and a clear objective. The language is objective and precise. The physical parameters and modeling approximations are standard and realistic for a first-order analysis of DRAM operation. The problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution is formulated below.\n\n**Derivation of Precharge Time $t_{\\text{RP}}$**\n\nThe precharge process is modeled as a first-order $RC$ circuit where each bitline capacitance $C_{BL}$ is driven towards the mid-rail voltage $V_{PC} = V_{DD}/2$ through an equivalent resistance $R_{eq}$. This resistance corresponds to the parallel combination of the NMOS and PMOS transistors forming the transmission gate. The equivalent conductance is given as $g_{eq} = g_n + g_p$, so $R_{eq} = 1/g_{eq}$.\n\nThe time constant of this RC circuit is $\\tau = R_{eq}C_{BL} = C_{BL}/g_{eq}$. The voltage on a bitline, $V(t)$, starting from an initial voltage $V(0)$, follows the transient equation:\n$$V(t) = V_{PC} + (V(0) - V_{PC}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)$$\n\nWe consider the worst-case initial conditions: $V_{BL}(0) = V_{DD}$ and $V_{\\overline{BL}}(0) = 0$.\nFor the bitline starting at $V_{DD}$:\n$$V_{BL}(t) = \\frac{V_{DD}}{2} + \\left(V_{DD} - \\frac{V_{DD}}{2}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) = \\frac{V_{DD}}{2} + \\frac{V_{DD}}{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)$$\nFor the bitline starting at $0$:\n$$V_{\\overline{BL}}(t) = \\frac{V_{DD}}{2} + \\left(0 - \\frac{V_{DD}}{2}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) = \\frac{V_{DD}}{2} - \\frac{V_{DD}}{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)$$\n\nThe precharge is considered complete at time $t_{\\text{RP}}$ when the voltage on both bitlines is within the tolerance band $\\pm\\delta$ of $V_{PC}$. This means $|V(t_{\\text{RP}}) - V_{PC}| \\le \\delta$.\nFor $V_{BL}(t_{\\text{RP}})$:\n$$\\left|V_{BL}(t_{\\text{RP}}) - \\frac{V_{DD}}{2}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{V_{DD}}{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\text{RP}}}{\\tau}\\right)\\right| = \\frac{V_{DD}}{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\text{RP}}}{\\tau}\\right)$$\nFor $V_{\\overline{BL}}(t_{\\text{RP}})$:\n$$\\left|V_{\\overline{BL}}(t_{\\text{RP}}) - \\frac{V_{DD}}{2}\\right| = \\left|-\\frac{V_{DD}}{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\text{RP}}}{\\tau}\\right)\\right| = \\frac{V_{DD}}{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\text{RP}}}{\\tau}\\right)$$\nThe condition is identical for both bitlines. We solve for the minimum time $t_{\\text{RP}}$ that satisfies the equality:\n$$\\frac{V_{DD}}{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\text{RP}}}{\\tau}\\right) = \\delta$$\n$$\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\text{RP}}}{\\tau}\\right) = \\frac{2\\delta}{V_{DD}}$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$-\\frac{t_{\\text{RP}}}{\\tau} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{2\\delta}{V_{DD}}\\right)$$\n$$t_{\\text{RP}} = -\\tau \\ln\\left(\\frac{2\\delta}{V_{DD}}\\right) = \\tau \\ln\\left(\\left(\\frac{2\\delta}{V_{DD}}\\right)^{-1}\\right) = \\tau \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{DD}}{2\\delta}\\right)$$\nSubstituting $\\tau = C_{BL}/g_{eq} = C_{BL}/(g_n+g_p)$:\n$$t_{\\text{RP}} = \\frac{C_{BL}}{g_n + g_p} \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{DD}}{2\\delta}\\right)$$\n\nNext, we calculate the conductances $g_n$ and $g_p$. The gate voltages are $V_{G,n} = V_{DD}$ and $V_{G,p} = 0$. The source of the transistors is connected to $V_{PC} = V_{DD}/2$. We use the specified approximation for gate-source voltages:\n$$V_{GS,n} = V_{G,n} - V_S = V_{DD} - \\frac{V_{DD}}{2} = \\frac{V_{DD}}{2}$$\n$$V_{SG,p} = V_S - V_{G,p} = \\frac{V_{DD}}{2} - 0 = \\frac{V_{DD}}{2}$$\nThe conductances are:\n$$g_n = \\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W_n}{L_n} \\left(\\frac{V_{DD}}{2} - V_{TH,n}\\right)$$\n$$g_p = \\mu_{p} C_{ox} \\frac{W_p}{L_p} \\left(\\frac{V_{DD}}{2} - |V_{TH,p}|\\right)$$\n\n**Analytic Expression for $t_{\\text{RP}}(V_{DD})$**\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $g_n$ and $g_p$ into the equation for $t_{\\text{RP}}$ gives the closed-form expression for $t_{\\text{RP}}$ as a function of $V_{DD}$ and other parameters. This is the answer to the second part of the question.\n$$t_{\\text{RP}}(V_{DD}) = \\frac{C_{BL}}{\\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W_{n}}{L_{n}}\\left(\\frac{V_{DD}}{2} - V_{TH,n}\\right) + \\mu_{p} C_{ox} \\frac{W_{p}}{L_{p}}\\left(\\frac{V_{DD}}{2} - |V_{TH,p}|\\right)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{DD}}{2\\delta}\\right)$$\nFor this expression to be physically valid, two conditions on the domain of $V_{DD}$ must hold:\n1. The transistors must be turned on, meaning their overdrive voltages must be positive: $\\frac{V_{DD}}{2} - V_{TH,n} > 0$ and $\\frac{V_{DD}}{2} - |V_{TH,p}| > 0$. This implies $V_{DD} > 2 \\max(V_{TH,n}, |V_{TH,p}|)$.\n2. The argument of the natural logarithm must be greater than $1$ for $t_{\\text{RP}}$ to be positive, so $\\frac{V_{DD}}{2\\delta} > 1$, which means $V_{DD} > 2\\delta$. Typically, the first condition is more restrictive.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values to calculate $t_{\\text{RP}}$.\n$C_{BL} = 400 \\times 10^{-15} \\,\\text{F}$\n$V_{DD} = 1.0 \\,\\text{V}$\n$\\delta = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\text{V}$\n$V_{TH,n} = 0.35 \\,\\text{V}$, $|V_{TH,p}| = 0.35 \\,\\text{V}$\n$\\mu_n C_{ox} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\,\\text{A/V}^2$, $W_n/L_n = 0.50/0.06 = 25/3$\n$\\mu_p C_{ox} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-4} \\,\\text{A/V}^2$, $W_p/L_p = 1.00/0.06 = 50/3$\n\nFirst, calculate the overdrive voltages:\n$$\\frac{V_{DD}}{2} - V_{TH,n} = \\frac{1.0}{2} - 0.35 = 0.5 - 0.35 = 0.15 \\,\\text{V}$$\n$$\\frac{V_{DD}}{2} - |V_{TH,p}| = \\frac{1.0}{2} - 0.35 = 0.5 - 0.35 = 0.15 \\,\\text{V}$$\nThese conditions are met as $V_{DD}=1.0\\,\\text{V} > 2 \\times 0.35\\,\\text{V} = 0.7\\,\\text{V}$.\n\nNow, calculate the conductances:\n$$g_n = (3.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\,\\text{A/V}^2) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.50}{0.06}\\right) \\times (0.15 \\,\\text{V}) = 3.75 \\times 10^{-4} \\,\\text{A/V}$$\n$$g_p = (1.5 \\times 10^{-4} \\,\\text{A/V}^2) \\times \\left(\\frac{1.00}{0.06}\\right) \\times (0.15 \\,\\text{V}) = 3.75 \\times 10^{-4} \\,\\text{A/V}$$\nThe total conductance is:\n$$g_{eq} = g_n + g_p = 3.75 \\times 10^{-4} + 3.75 \\times 10^{-4} = 7.5 \\times 10^{-4} \\,\\text{A/V}$$\n\nNext, calculate the logarithm term:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{DD}}{2\\delta}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1.0}{2 \\times 5.0 \\times 10^{-3}}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1.0}{0.01}\\right) = \\ln(100) \\approx 4.60517$$\n\nFinally, calculate $t_{\\text{RP}}$:\n$$t_{\\text{RP}} = \\frac{C_{BL}}{g_{eq}} \\ln(100) = \\frac{400 \\times 10^{-15} \\,\\text{F}}{7.5 \\times 10^{-4} \\,\\text{A/V}} \\times \\ln(100)$$\n$$t_{\\text{RP}} \\approx (5.333... \\times 10^{-10} \\,\\text{s}) \\times 4.60517 \\approx 2.45609 \\times 10^{-9} \\,\\text{s}$$\nConverting to nanoseconds and rounding to three significant figures:\n$$t_{\\text{RP}} \\approx 2.46 \\,\\text{ns}$$\n\nThe final answer requires two parts: the numerical value for $t_{\\text{RP}}$ in nanoseconds, and the derived analytical expression for $t_{\\text{RP}}(V_{DD})$.",

Derivation of the cell restoration time, $t_{\\text{restore}}(T)$.\n\nThe restoration of a DRAM cell's charge is modeled as a first-order Resistor-Capacitor (RC) charging process. The cell capacitor, with capacitance $C_{\\text{cell}}$, charges through the pass-transistor's on-resistance, $R_{\\text{pass}}(T)$, towards the supply voltage, $V_{\\text{DD}}$.

            "solution": "The user wants to find the maximum feasible steady-state activation rate for a given DRAM command sequence, subject to specified timing constraints. This problem can be modeled by constructing a timing constraint graph and finding the minimum possible period for the repeating 8-command sequence. The maximum activation rate will then be the number of activations in the sequence divided by this minimum period.\n\nLet $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_8$ be the nodes of the graph, representing the eight activate ($\\mathrm{ACT}$) commands in the sequence. Let $t_i$ be the time at which command $v_i$ is issued within a single period. An edge from node $v_i$ to $v_j$ with weight $w$ represents the constraint $t_j \\ge t_i + w$. Since the sequence repeats indefinitely with a period $T_{period}$, some constraints will wrap around from the end of one sequence to the beginning of the next. A constraint of the form $t_j' \\ge t_i + w$, where $t_j'$ is the time of command $v_j$ in the next period ($t_j' = t_j + T_{period}$), can be written as $t_j + T_{period} \\ge t_i + w$.\n\nThe minimum period $T_{period}$ of a periodic schedule is determined by the critical cycle in the constraint graph.
