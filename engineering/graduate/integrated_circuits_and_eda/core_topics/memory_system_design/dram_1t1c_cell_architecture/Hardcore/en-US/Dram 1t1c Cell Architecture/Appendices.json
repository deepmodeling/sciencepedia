The derivation must start from the fundamental definitions of charge and current, and the constitutive relation for a capacitor.\n\nFirst, we state the definition of electric current, $I$, as the rate of change of electric charge, $Q$, with respect to time, $t$. This is expressed differentially as:\n$$I = \\frac{dQ}{dt}$$\nThe problem specifies a constant leakage current magnitude, $I_{\\text{leak}}$, over the refresh interval $t_{\\text{REF}}$. For a constant current, the total charge $\\Delta Q$ that flows during a time interval $\\Delta t$ is given by $\\Delta Q = I \\cdot \\Delta t$. In our case, the magnitude of the total charge lost from the storage node, $|\\Delta Q_{\\text{lost}}|$, over the time $t_{\\text{REF}}$ is:\n$$|\\Delta Q_{\\text{lost}}| = I_{\\text{leak}} \\cdot t_{\\text{REF}}$$\n\nSecond, we state the constitutive relation for a linear capacitor, which relates the charge stored, $Q_C$, to the voltage across the capacitor, $V_C$, through the capacitance, $C_C$:\n$$Q_C = C_C V_C$$\nAssuming that $C_C$ is a constant value, a change in the stored charge, $\\Delta Q_C$, will result in a proportional change in the voltage, $\\Delta V_C$:\n$$\\Delta Q_C = C_C \\Delta V_C$$\nThe magnitude of this relationship is $|\\Delta Q_C| = |C_C \\Delta V_C|$. Since $C_C$ is a positive physical quantity, this simplifies to:\n$$|\\Delta Q_C| = C_C |\\Delta V_C|$$\n\nThe charge lost due to leakage, $\\Delta Q_{\\text{lost}}$, is precisely the change in charge on the capacitor, $\\Delta Q_C$. Therefore, we can equate the magnitudes:\n$$|\\Delta Q_C| = |\\Delta Q_{\\text{lost}}|$$\nSubstituting the expressions from the principles above yields:\n$$C_C |\\Delta V_C| = I_{\\text{leak}} \\cdot t_{\\text{REF}}$$\nThis equation provides the core relationship between the voltage droop $|\\Delta V_C|$ and the physical parameters of the system.\n\nThe problem imposes a constraint on the maximum permissible voltage droop to ensure reliable sensing.

The wordline is asserted, turning on the nMOSFET access transistor. This allows current to flow from the bitline to the storage capacitor, charging it. In this configuration, the bitline acts as the drain and the storage capacitor node acts as the source of the nMOSFET.\n\nLet's define the voltages at the transistor terminals:\n- Gate voltage: $V_G = V_{\\text{WL}}$\n- Drain voltage: $V_D = V_{\\text{BL}} = V_{\\text{DD}}$\n- Source voltage: $V_S = V_{\\text{cell}}$, where $V_{\\text{cell}}$ is the voltage on the storage capacitor.\n- Body voltage: $V_B = 0$ (as it is tied to ground).\n\nAs the capacitor charges, $V_{\\text{cell}}$ increases. The transistor conducts as long as its gate-to-source voltage, $V_{\\text{GS}}$, is greater than its threshold voltage, $V_{\\text{TH}}$.\nThe gate-to-source voltage is $V_{\\text{GS}} = V_G - V_S = V_{\\text{WL}} - V_{\\text{cell}}$.\n\nThe threshold voltage $V_{\\text{TH}}$ is not constant; it increases as $V_S$ increases due to the body effect.

For a stored logical “$1$,” the cell node is at a high voltage $V_1$ and the strike tends to remove charge from the capacitor (reduce the voltage). For a stored logical “$0$,” the cell node is at a low voltage $V_0$ and the strike tends to add charge (increase the voltage). Assume writes are performed without wordline boosting, so $V_1 \\approx V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{th}}$ and $V_0 \\approx 0$. The sense amplifier decides the bit value from the polarity and magnitude of the small differential voltage on the complementary bitlines at its enable time.\n\nUsing only first principles (capacitor charge-voltage relation, passive charge sharing between capacitors, and a finite resistance that sets an $RC$ time constant), compare the susceptibility of storing “$0$” versus “$1$” to soft errors by explicitly deriving the minimum upset charge $Q_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ needed to flip each state, first for a quasi-static read in which the sense amplifier is enabled after charge sharing has effectively equilibrated, and then for a faster sense in which $t_s = \\tau$ where $\\tau$ is the $RC$ time constant determined by the access transistor and the relevant capacitances.

Storing “$1$” is more susceptible than storing “$0$” because the high-level voltage is limited by the access transistor threshold, reducing the voltage distance to the bitline precharge level and thus lowering the required upset charge to cross the sense threshold; moreover, enabling the sense amplifier earlier increases the required charge for both states but increases it by a larger fraction for the “$1$” state.\n\nB. Storing “$0$” is more susceptible than storing “$1$” because a small number of electrons can raise the cell voltage above the precharge level with no barrier; sense timing affects only the “$0$” state since the “$1$” state already has a large margin.\n\nC. Storing “$0$” and “$1$” are equally susceptible under the stated conditions because the bitline precharge is symmetric; the required upset charge and timing sensitivity are identical for both logic states.\n\nD.

Quantitative Analysis**\n\nLet's compute the two terms in the expressions:\n- Baseline charge for '1': $C_{\\mathrm{cell}}(V_1 - V_{\\mathrm{BL}0}) = (30\\,\\mathrm{fF})(0.3\\,\\mathrm{V}) = 9\\,\\mathrm{fC}$\n- Baseline charge for '0': $C_{\\mathrm{cell}}(V_{\\mathrm{BL}0} - V_0) = (30\\,\\mathrm{fF})(0.5\\,\\mathrm{V}) = 15\\,\\mathrm{fC}$\n- Sensing margin charge: $V_{\\mathrm{trip}}(C_{\\mathrm{cell}} + C_{\\mathrm{BL}}) = (0.015\\,\\mathrm{V})(330\\,\\mathrm{fF}) = 4.95\\,\\mathrm{fC}$\n\n**Regime 1: Quasi-static read ($t_s \\rightarrow \\infty$)**\nHere, $1 - e^{-t_s/\\tau} \\rightarrow 1$.\n$Q_{\\mathrm{crit},1,\\infty} = 9\\,\\mathrm{fC} + 4.95\\,\\mathrm{fC} = 13.95\\,\\mathrm{fC}$\n$Q_{\\mathrm{crit},0,\\infty} = 15\\,\\mathrm{fC} + 4.95\\,\\mathrm{fC} = 19.95\\,\\mathrm{fC}$\nSince $Q_{\\mathrm{crit},1,\\infty} < Q_{\\mathrm{crit},0,\\infty}$, the stored '1' state is more susceptible to soft errors.\n\n**Regime 2: Faster sense ($t_s = \\tau$)**\nHere, the timing factor is $\\frac{1}{1 - e^{-1}} \\approx \\frac{1}{1 - 0.3678} \\approx 1.582$.\n$Q_{\\mathrm{crit},1,\\tau} = 9\\,\\mathrm{fC} + (4.95\\,\\mathrm{fC}) \\times 1.582 \\approx 9\\,\\mathrm{fC} + 7.83\\,\\mathrm{fC} = 16.83\\,\\mathrm{fC}$\n$Q_{\\mathrm{crit},0,\\tau} = 15\\,\\mathrm{fC} + (4.95\\,\\mathrm{fC}) \\times 1.582 \\approx 15\\,\\mathrm{fC} + 7.83\\,\\mathrm{fC} = 22.83\\,\\mathrm{fC}$\nAgain, $Q_{\\mathrm{crit},1,\\tau} < Q_{\\mathrm{crit},0,\\tau}$, so the '1' state remains more susceptible.\n\n**5. Timing Sensitivity Analysis**\n\nEnabling the sense amplifier earlier (decreasing $t_s$) increases the factor $\\frac{1}{1 - e^{-t_s/\\tau}}$, which increases the required upset charge $Q_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ for both states.\n- Absolute increase in $Q_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ from $t_s=\\infty$ to $t_s=\\tau$:\n$\\Delta Q_{\\mathrm{crit}} = Q_{\\mathrm{crit}}(t_s=\\tau) - Q_{\\mathrm{crit}}(t_s=\\infty) = (4.95\\,\\mathrm{fC}) \\times (1.582 - 1) \\approx 2.88\\,\\mathrm{fC}$.\nThis absolute increase is identical for both states.\n- Fractional increase in $Q_{\\mathrm{crit}}$:\nFor '1': $\\frac{\\Delta Q_{\\mathrm{crit}}}{Q_{\\mathrm{crit},1,\\infty}} = \\frac{2.88\\,\\mathrm{fC}}{13.95\\,\\mathrm{fC}} \\approx 0.206$, or a $20.6\\%$ increase.\nFor '0': $\\frac{\\Delta Q_{\\mathrm{crit}}}{Q_{\\mathrm{crit},0,\\infty}} = \\frac{2.88\\,\\mathrm{fC}}{19.95\\,\\mathrm{fC}} \\approx 0.144$, or a $14.4\\%$ increase.\nThe fractional increase is larger for the stored '1' state. This means its immunity to upset is degraded more severely, in relative terms, by early sensing. Therefore, the '1' state's readout is more sensitive to early sense timing.\n\n**6. Evaluation of Options**\n\nA. Storing “$1$” is more susceptible than storing “$0$” because the high-level voltage is limited by the access transistor threshold, reducing the voltage distance to the bitline precharge level and thus lowering the required upset charge to cross the sense threshold; moreover, enabling the sense amplifier earlier increases the required charge for both states but increases it by a larger fraction for the “$1$” state.\nThis statement fully aligns with our derivation.\n- \"Storing '1' is more susceptible than storing '0'\": Correct, as $Q_{\\mathrm{crit},1} < Q_{\\mathrm{crit},0}$.\n- \"because the high-level voltage is limited ... reducing the voltage distance\": Correct, $V_1 - V_{\\mathrm{BL}0} < V_{\\mathrm{BL}0} - V_0$.\n- \"lowering the required upset charge\": Correct, this reduced voltage distance is the primary reason $Q_{\\mathrm{crit},1}$ is lower.\n- \"enabling ... earlier increases the required charge for both states\": Correct.\n- \"but increases it by a larger fraction for the '1' state\": Correct, as shown by our calculation of fractional increases ($20.6\\% > 14.4\\%$).\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. Storing “$0$” is more susceptible than storing “$1$” because a small number of electrons can raise the cell voltage above the precharge level with no barrier; sense timing affects only the “$0$” state since the “$1$” state already has a large margin.\n- \"Storing '0' is more susceptible\": Incorrect.\n- \"sense timing affects only the '0' state\": Incorrect, it affects both.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Storing “$0$” and “$1$” are equally susceptible under the stated conditions because the bitline precharge is symmetric; the required upset charge and timing sensitivity are identical for both logic states.\n- \"equally susceptible\": Incorrect. The susceptibility is asymmetric due to the $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$ drop on the written '1' level.\n- \"required upset charge ... are identical\": Incorrect.\n- \"timing sensitivity are identical\": Incorrect, the fractional sensitivity is different.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Susceptibility depends only on the sense amplifier’s input-referred trip requirement and not on the stored voltage levels; therefore timing and the access-transistor threshold have no effect on the required upset charge.\n- \"depends only on the ... trip requirement and not on the stored voltage levels\": Incorrect. The $Q_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ formulae explicitly depend on $V_1$ and $V_0$.\n- \"timing and ... threshold have no effect\": Incorrect. $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$ sets $V_1$, and timing $t_s$ is in the equations.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the rigorous derivation, Option A is the only one that correctly and completely describes the physical behavior of the system.",
