            "solution": "The problem is validated as follows.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Quantizer type: $1$-bit\n- Quantizer step size: $\\Delta = 2$\n- Input signal: Sinusoid\n- Input amplitude: $A = 0.25$ full-scale (FS)\n- Input frequency: $f_{in} = 0.01 f_{s}$\n- Assumed error model: Quantization error is an independent, stationary, white, uniform random process.\n- Integration bandwidth: $B = 0.2 f_{s}$\n- Required normalization: Normalized to the squared full-scale amplitude ($\\mathrm{FS}^{2}$).\n- Required precision: Round to four significant figures.\n- Additional task: Qualitatively discuss the error of the white-noise assumption.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem uses a standard, albeit simplified, model for quantization error (the white-noise model) which is fundamental to the introductory analysis of ADCs, particularly Delta-Sigma modulators. It explicitly asks for a calculation based on this model and then a critique of the model's limitations, which is a sound pedagogical approach.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary parameters ($\\Delta$, $B$, $f_s$) to calculate the in-band noise power under the specified assumptions. While the term \"full-scale (FS)\" can be ambiguous, the context of a $1$-bit quantizer with step size $\\Delta = 2$ allows for a consistent interpretation where the output levels are $-1$ and $+1$, leading to a full-scale amplitude of $1$. The calculation of noise power under the white-noise assumption is independent of the input signal's amplitude, so any ambiguity in its definition does not render the quantitative part of the problem unsolvable.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using clear, objective, and standard terminology from the field of signal processing and data converters.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Quantitative Analysis: In-Band Quantization Noise Power**\n\nThe calculation proceeds by first determining the total power of the quantization error based on the given statistical model, then finding its power spectral density (PSD), and finally integrating the PSD over the specified bandwidth.\n\nA $1$-bit quantizer has two output levels. A step size of $\\Delta = 2$ between these levels implies, for a symmetric implementation, that the output levels are $y_{out} = -1$ and $y_{out} = +1$. The decision threshold is at $0$. Such a quantizer can handle input signals within the range $[-1, 1]$ without overload. The \"full-scale amplitude\" for such a system is the maximum non-clipping input amplitude, which is $A_{FS} = 1$. The analysis will be performed in these normalized units.\n\nThe problem requires us to model the quantization error, $e[n]$, as a stationary random process, uniformly distributed over an interval of width $\\Delta$. The standard model assumes this interval is $[-\\Delta/2, \\Delta/2]$.\nGiven $\\Delta = 2$, the probability density function (PDF) of the error $e$ is:\n$$\np(e) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{\\Delta} = \\frac{1}{2} & \\text{for } -1 \\le e \\le 1 \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe total power of this zero-mean quantization error process is equal to its variance, $\\sigma_e^2$.\n$$\nP_e = \\sigma_e^2 = E[e^2] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^2 p(e) de = \\int_{-1}^{1} e^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) de\n$$\n$$\nP_e = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{e^3}{3} \\right]_{-1}^{1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1^3}{3} - \\frac{(-1)^3}{3} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{3} - \\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\nThis result is consistent with the well-known formula for quantization noise power, $P_e = \\frac{\\Delta^2}{12} = \\frac{2^2}{12} = \\frac{4}{12} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe problem states that the noise is \"white\". For a discrete-time signal sampled at a frequency $f_s$, this means the total power $P_e$ is spread uniformly across the Nyquist frequency band, from $-f_s/2$ to $f_s/2$. Let $S_e(f)$ be the two-sided power spectral density of the error. Then:\n$$\nP_e = \\int_{-f_s/2}^{f_s/2} S_e(f) df\n$$\nSince $S_e(f)$ is constant for a white noise source, let $S_e(f) = S_0$.\n$$\nP_e = S_0 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{f_s}{2} - \\left(-\\frac{f_s}{2}\\right)\\right) = S_0 \\cdot f_s\n$$\nThus, the PSD level is:\n$$\nS_0 = \\frac{P_e}{f_s} = \\frac{1}{3f_s}\n$$\nThe in-band noise power, $P_{in-band}$, is the power contained in the baseband of width $B = 0.2 f_s$. This corresponds to the frequency interval $[-B, B]$. We find this by integrating the PSD over this interval:\n$$\nP_{in-band} = \\int_{-B}^{B} S_e(f) df = \\int_{-B}^{B} S_0 df = S_0 \\cdot (B - (-B)) = 2BS_0\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $B$ and $S_0$:\n$$\nP_{in-band} = 2(0.2 f_s) \\left(\\frac{1}{3f_s}\\right) = 0.4 f_s \\cdot \\frac{1}{3f_s} = \\frac{0.4}{3} = \\frac{4/10}{3} = \\frac{4}{30} = \\frac{2}{15}\n$$\nThe problem asks for this power to be normalized to the \"squared full-scale amplitude\". As established, the full-scale amplitude for this quantizer is $A_{FS} = 1$. The squared full-scale amplitude is $A_{FS}^2 = 1^2 = 1$.\nThe normalized in-band noise power, $P_{norm}$, is:\n$$\nP_{norm} = \\frac{P_{in-band}}{A_{FS}^2} = \\frac{2/15}{1} = \\frac{2}{15}\n$$\nFinally, we convert this fraction to a decimal and round to four significant figures:\n$$\nP_{norm} = \\frac{2}{15} \\approx 0.133333... \\approx 0.1333\n$$\n\n**Qualitative Discussion: Validity of the White-Noise Assumption**\n\nThe white-noise assumption, while mathematically convenient for the preceding calculation, is highly inaccurate for the specific system described: a standalone $1$-bit quantizer with a low-frequency sinusoidal input.\n\nFor a standalone quantizer, the quantization error $e[n]=y[n]-x[n]$ is deterministically related to the input $x[n]$. With a sinusoidal input $x[n] = A \\sin(2\\pi \\frac{f_{in}}{f_s} n)$, where $A=0.25 \\, \\text{FS}$ and $f_{in} = 0.01 f_s$, the quantizer output $y[n]$ will be a simple square wave with the same fundamental frequency $f_{in}$. The error signal, $e[n]$, is the difference between this square wave and the input sinusoid. This error is periodic and highly structured, not random. Its power spectrum is not flat (\"white\"); instead, it consists of strong, discrete tones located at the odd harmonics of the input frequency (i.e., at $3f_{in}, 5f_{in}, 7f_{in}, \\dots$) that fall within the Nyquist band. This phenomenon is known as tonal behavior or pattern noise and is a severe limitation of coarse quantizers with simple inputs.\n\nHowever, the problem statement places this analysis \"in the context of Delta-Sigma ADC architectures and noise shaping\". In a complete Delta-Sigma modulator, the quantizer is embedded within a feedback loop. The input to the quantizer is no longer just the signal $x[n]$, but a combination of $x[n]$ and a filtered version of past quantization errors. This feedback signal acts as a high-frequency dither. The dither signal causes the quantizer's input to be a \"busy,\" rapidly-varying signal that constantly traverses the quantization threshold, regardless of the characteristics of the external input $x[n]$. This process effectively randomizes the quantization error, decorrelating it from the input signal and making its spectrum much more uniform and noise-like.\n\nTherefore, the white-noise model becomes a reasonably valid and useful approximation for analyzing the performance of the *entire Delta-Sigma modulator loop*, even with a $1$-bit quantizer. The feedback loop also shapes the power spectrum of this now-whitened noise, using a noise transfer function (NTF) to push the noise power out of the low-frequency signal band and into higher frequencies, where it can be removed by a digital decimation filter. The calculation performed, while technically incorrect for the standalone quantizer, thus represents a foundational step in the standard simplified analysis of a complete Delta-Sigma ADC, where the assumption is made justifiable by the action of the feedback loop.",

The quantity of interest is the infinity norm of the NTF on the unit circle, defined as $\\|NTF\\|_{\\infty} = \\sup_{\\omega \\in [0, 2\\pi)} \\left|NTF\\left(e^{j\\omega}\\right)\\right|$. Your task is to compute $\\|NTF\\|_{\\infty}$ numerically for the given parameter sets and then assess the likely stability of the corresponding ΔΣ modulator using a $1$-bit quantizer at a $-6$ dBFS sinusoidal input.\n\nFundamental base and definitions:\n- The Z-transform evaluation on the unit circle uses $z = e^{j\\omega}$, where $\\omega$ is the digital angular frequency in radians, and the magnitude response is $\\left|NTF\\left(e^{j\\omega}\\right)\\right|$.\n- The infinity norm $\\|NTF\\|_{\\infty}$ is the supremum of the magnitude response over the unit circle, i.e., the largest value of $\\left|NTF\\left(e^{j\\omega}\\right)\\right|$ for $\\omega \\in [0, 2\\pi)$.\n- A widely used empirical design rule (Lee criterion) for single-bit ΔΣ modulators states that the peak NTF gain should satisfy $\\|NTF\\|_{\\infty} < 1.5$ for robust stability across input amplitudes. While this is a heuristic and not a proof of stability, it is a well-tested guideline in integrated circuit practice.\n\nNumerical computation requirements:\n- Angles must be in radians.\n- Compute $\\left|NTF\\left(e^{j\\omega}\\right)\\right|$ on a uniform grid of $N$ points with $N = 131072$ samples of $\\omega$ over $[0, 2\\pi)$, and use the maximum sampled value to approximate $\\|NTF\\|_{\\infty}$.\n- Use the following fixed sinusoidal input amplitude corresponding to $-6$ dBFS: $A_{\\mathrm{in}} = 10^{-6/20}$ (dimensionless). This value must be computed but is only used to contextualize the stability assessment (the Lee criterion threshold itself does not explicitly depend on $A_{\\mathrm{in}}$).\n\nStability assessment rule:\n- Declare the modulator “likely stable” if $\\|NTF\\|_{\\infty} < 1.5$ and “likely unstable” otherwise.

The NTF is defined as:\n$$NTF(z) = \\frac{(1 - z^{-1})^{p}}{(1 - a z^{-1})}$$\nwhere $p$ is a positive integer representing the order of the noise shaping, and $a$ is a real scalar pole location, constrained by $0 < a < 1$.\n\nThe infinity norm, $\\|NTF\\|_{\\infty}$, is the peak magnitude of the NTF on the unit circle in the z-plane. It is formally defined as:\n$$\\|NTF\\|_{\\infty} = \\sup_{\\omega \\in [0, 2\\pi)} \\left|NTF\\left(e^{j\\omega}\\right)\\right|$$\nwhere $z = e^{j\\omega}$ and $\\omega$ is the normalized digital angular frequency.\n\nThe problem requires a numerical approximation of this supremum.

The in-band quantization noise power, $P_Q$, is the integral of this PSD over the signal bandwidth $[-f_b, f_b]$:\n$$P_Q = \\int_{-f_b}^{f_b} S_Q(f) df = \\int_{-f_s/(2\\cdot\\mathrm{OSR})}^{f_s/(2\\cdot\\mathrm{OSR})} \\frac{\\Delta^2}{12 f_s} |H_{NTF}(e^{j2\\pi f/f_s})|^2 df$$\nUsing the approximation for the NTF and noting the integrand is an even function:\n$$P_Q \\approx 2 \\int_{0}^{f_s/(2\\cdot\\mathrm{OSR})} \\frac{\\Delta^2}{12 f_s} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi f}{f_s}\\right)^4 df$$\n$$P_Q = \\frac{2\\Delta^2}{12 f_s} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{f_s}\\right)^4 \\int_{0}^{f_s/(2\\cdot\\mathrm{OSR})} f^4 df = \\frac{\\Delta^2}{6 f_s} \\frac{16\\pi^4}{f_s^4} \\left[ \\frac{f^5}{5} \\right]_{0}^{f_s/(2\\cdot\\mathrm{OSR})}$$\n$$P_Q = \\frac{8\\pi^4\\Delta^2}{15 f_s^5} \\left( \\frac{f_s}{2\\cdot\\mathrm{OSR}} \\right)^5 = \\frac{8\\pi^4\\Delta^2}{15 f_s^5} \\frac{f_s^5}{32 \\cdot \\mathrm{OSR}^5} = \\frac{\\pi^4 \\Delta^2}{60 \\cdot \\mathrm{OSR}^5}$$\nNow, we can compute the quantization-noise-limited SNDR, $\\mathrm{SNDR}_Q$:\n$$\\mathrm{SNDR}_Q = \\frac{P_S}{P_Q} = \\frac{A^2/2}{\\frac{\\pi^4 \\Delta^2}{60 \\cdot \\mathrm{OSR}^5}} = \\frac{30 A^2 (\\mathrm{OSR})^5}{\\pi^4 \\Delta^2}$$\nSubstituting the given values: $A=0.5$, $\\Delta=2$, and $\\mathrm{OSR}=128$:\n$$\\mathrm{SNDR}_Q = \\frac{30 \\cdot (0.5)^2 \\cdot (128)^5}{\\pi^4 \\cdot (2)^2} = \\frac{30 \\cdot 0.25 \\cdot (128)^5}{4\\pi^4} = \\frac{1.875 \\cdot (128)^5}{\\pi^4} \\approx 6.6206 \\times 10^8$$\nIn decibels (dB), this is:\n$$\\mathrm{SNDR}_Q \\text{ [dB]} = 10\\log_{10}(\\mathrm{SNDR}_Q) = 10\\log_{10}(6.6206 \\times 10^8) \\approx 88.2045 \\text{ dB}$$\n\n**2. Jitter-Limited SNDR ($\\mathrm{SNDR}_J$)**\n\nJitter introduces a sampling time error. For an input signal $x(t) = A\\sin(2\\pi f_{in} t)$, the error in the sampled value due to a timing error $\\delta_t$ can be approximated using a first-order Taylor expansion for small $\\delta_t$:\n$$e_j(t) = x(t+\\delta_t) - x(t) \\approx \\delta_t \\cdot \\frac{dx}{dt}$$\nThe derivative of the input signal is $\\frac{dx}{dt} = 2\\pi f_{in} A \\cos(2\\pi f_{in} t)$. The instantaneous error is:\n$$e_j(t) \\approx \\delta_t \\cdot 2\\pi f_{in} A \\cos(2\\pi f_{in} t)$$\nThe jitter noise power, $P_J$, is the mean-square value of this error. We assume the jitter $\\delta_t$ is a random process with zero mean and variance $\\sigma_t^2$, and that it is uncorrelated with the signal.\n$$P_J = E[e_j(t)^2] \\approx E[(\\delta_t \\cdot 2\\pi f_{in} A \\cos(2\\pi f_{in} t))^2]$$\n$$P_J = E[\\delta_t^2] \\cdot (2\\pi f_{in} A)^2 \\cdot E[\\cos^2(2\\pi f_{in} t)]$$\nThe term $E[\\delta_t^2]$ is the jitter variance, $\\sigma_t^2$. The time-average (or expectation over a random phase) of $\\cos^2(\\theta)$ is $1/2$. Thus:\n$$P_J = \\sigma_t^2 \\cdot (2\\pi f_{in} A)^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 2\\pi^2 f_{in}^2 A^2 \\sigma_t^2$$\nThe jitter-limited SNDR, $\\mathrm{SNDR}_J$, is the ratio of signal power to jitter noise power. Noticeably, the amplitude term $A$ cancels out.\n$$\\mathrm{SNDR}_J = \\frac{P_S}{P_J} = \\frac{A^2/2}{2\\pi^2 f_{in}^2 A^2 \\sigma_t^2} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi^2 f_{in}^2 \\sigma_t^2}$$\nSubstituting the given values: $f_{in} = 10^5$ Hz and $\\sigma_t = 10^{-12}$ s:\n$$\\mathrm{SNDR}_J = \\frac{1}{4\\pi^2 (10^5)^2 (10^{-12})^2} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi^2 (10^{10}) (10^{-24})} = \\frac{10^{14}}{4\\pi^2} \\approx 2.5330 \\times 10^{12}$$\nIn decibels, this is:\n$$\\mathrm{SNDR}_J \\text{ [dB]} = 10\\log_{10}(\\mathrm{SNDR}_J) = 10\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{10^{14}}{4\\pi^2}\\right) = 140 - 10\\log_{10}(4\\pi^2) \\approx 124.0364 \\text{ dB}$$\n\n**3. Limiting SNDR**\n\nThe overall performance of the ADC is limited by the dominant noise source. We compare the two calculated SNDR values:\n$$\\mathrm{SNDR}_Q \\approx 88.20 \\text{ dB}$$\n$$\\mathrm{SNDR}_J \\approx 124.04 \\text{ dB}$$\nA lower SNDR value corresponds to a higher noise power relative to the signal. Therefore, the quantization noise is the dominant noise source in this system. The problem asks for the limiting SNDR, which is the smaller of the two values.\n$$\\text{Limiting SNDR} = \\min(\\mathrm{SNDR}_Q, \\mathrm{SNDR}_J) \\approx 88.2045 \\text{ dB}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $88.20$ dB.",
