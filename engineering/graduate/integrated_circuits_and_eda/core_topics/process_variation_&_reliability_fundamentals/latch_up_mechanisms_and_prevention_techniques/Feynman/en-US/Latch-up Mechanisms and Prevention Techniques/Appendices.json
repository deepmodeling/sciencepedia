The instruction to neglect the resistive effects of $R_{\\mathrm{well}}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{sub}}$ for the upper-bound calculation, despite providing their values, is a deliberate and valid step in engineering analysis to find a worst-case value. It does not constitute a contradiction.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and internally consistent. It is a valid problem in the field of integrated circuit design. We proceed with the solution.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe parasitic SCR structure in a bulk CMOS process can be modeled as a feedback loop consisting of a vertical PNP transistor, $Q_P$, and a lateral NPN transistor, $Q_N$. The collector of $Q_N$ is connected to the base of $Q_P$, and the collector of $Q_P$ is connected to the base of $Q_N$. Latch-up is a regenerative process that occurs when the positive feedback loop gain becomes sufficiently large.\n\nWe analyze the small-signal loop gain to find the onset condition. Let's consider a small incremental current, $\\delta I_{B,P}$, injected into the base of the PNP transistor, $Q_P$. The resulting incremental collector current of $Q_P$ is given by the definition of the common-emitter current gain, $\\beta_{\\mathrm{P}}$:\n$$\n\\delta I_{C,P} = \\beta_{\\mathrm{P}} \\delta I_{B,P}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that to find a conservative upper bound on the loop gain, we must neglect any attenuation due to the well and substrate resistances, $R_{\\mathrm{well}}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{sub}}$. In a physical circuit, these resistances would shunt a portion of the collector currents to the supply rails ($V_{DD}$ and $V_{SS}$), reducing the current available to drive the base of the other transistor. Neglecting this shunting effect means we assume that the entire collector current of one transistor becomes the base current of the other. This assumption maximizes the feedback and thus provides an upper bound on the loop gain.\n\nUnder this assumption, the incremental collector current of $Q_P$, $\\delta I_{C,P}$, fully feeds the base of the NPN transistor, $Q_N$:\n$$\n\\delta I_{B,N} = \\delta I_{C,P} = \\beta_{\\mathrm{P}} \\delta I_{B,P}\n$$\nThis base current at $Q_N$ is amplified, producing an incremental collector current $\\delta I_{C,N}$:\n$$\n\\delta I_{C,N} = \\beta_{\\mathrm{N}} \\delta I_{B,N}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\delta I_{B,N}$, we get:\n$$\n\\delta I_{C,N} = \\beta_{\\mathrm{N}} (\\beta_{\\mathrm{P}} \\delta I_{B,P})\n$$\nThe collector current of $Q_N$, $\\delta I_{C,N}$, is fed back to the base of the PNP transistor, $Q_P$, closing the loop. The small-signal loop gain, $G_{loop}$, is defined as the ratio of the returned signal current ($\\delta I_{C,N}$) to the initial injected signal current ($\\delta I_{B,P}$):\n$$\nG_{loop} = \\frac{\\delta I_{C,N}}{\\delta I_{B,P}}\n$$\nSubstituting our derived expression for $\\delta I_{C,N}$:\n$$\nG_{loop} = \\frac{\\beta_{\\mathrm{N}} \\beta_{\\mathrm{P}} \\delta I_{B,P}}{\\delta I_{B,P}} = \\beta_{\\mathrm{P}} \\beta_{\\mathrm{N}}\n$$\nThis expression, $\\beta_{\\mathrm{P}} \\beta_{\\mathrm{N}}$, represents the upper-bound small-signal loop gain derived under the specified ideal conditions.\n\nThe condition for regenerative action, leading to latch-up onset, is that the loop gain must be equal to or greater than unity. If $G_{loop} \\ge 1$, any small current perturbation will be amplified around the loop and grow, leading to a sustained high-current state. Therefore, the regenerative onset criterion is:\n$$\n\\beta_{\\mathrm{P}} \\beta_{\\mathrm{N}} \\ge 1\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value of this upper-bound loop gain using the given parameters: $\\beta_{\\mathrm{P}}=0.15$ and $\\beta_{\\mathrm{N}}=6.5$. The values for $R_{\\mathrm{well}}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{sub}}$ are not used in this calculation, as per the problem's instruction to find the conservative upper bound by neglecting their effects.\n\nThe numerical value of the upper-bound loop gain is:\n$$\nG_{loop, \\text{upper}} = \\beta_{\\mathrm{P}} \\beta_{\\mathrm{N}} = (0.15) \\times (6.5)\n$$\n$$\nG_{loop, \\text{upper}} = 0.975\n$$\nThis value is dimensionless, as expected for a gain. Since $0.975 < 1$, based on this conservative upper-bound calculation, the system is stable and would not be expected to enter latch-up. The question, however, only asks for the numerical value of this specific gain calculation.",

It is a well-defined engineering problem based on established principles of semiconductor device physics. The solution process can proceed.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe problem asks to determine the maximum allowable substrate resistance, $R_{sub}$, to prevent the initiation of latch-up in a CMOS circuit. Latch-up can be triggered when a parasitic SCR structure, inherent in bulk CMOS technology, is activated. A critical step in this activation is the forward-biasing of a parasitic p-n junction. In this case, the relevant junction is the one formed between the NMOS source diffusion (n-type) and the p-type substrate. The NMOS source acts as the emitter of a parasitic lateral npn bipolar transistor, and the substrate acts as its base.\n\nThe problem requires motivating the forward-bias onset voltage from the Shockley diode equation, which describes the current-voltage ($I-V$) characteristic of a p-n junction:\n$$I_D = I_S \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_D}{nk_BT}\\right) - 1 \\right)$$\nwhere $I_D$ is the diode current, $V_D$ is the voltage across the junction, $I_S$ is the reverse saturation current, $q$ is the elementary charge, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $n$ is the ideality factor. For a silicon junction, the current $I_D$ becomes significant only when the forward-bias voltage $V_D$ is large enough to make the exponential term dominant. This \"turn-on\" or \"onset\" voltage is conventionally taken to be in the range of $0.6 \\text{ V}$ to $0.7 \\text{ V}$ at room temperature. The problem specifies a conservative upper limit for this voltage to prevent turn-on: $V_{sub}^{\\max} = 0.6\\ \\text{V}$.\n\nThe physical mechanism for creating this voltage is the flow of the injected substrate current, $I_{inj}$, through the resistive path of the substrate, characterized by $R_{sub}$. The NMOS source is at ground potential ($0\\ \\text{V}$), as is the far-end of the substrate resistance path (the substrate tie). An injection of current $I_{inj}$ into the substrate near the NMOS source will raise the local substrate potential, $V_{sub}$, at that point. According to the stated model, this relationship is governed by the linear constitutive relation for a resistor, which is Ohm's Law:\n$$V_{sub} = I_{inj} R_{sub}$$\nThis voltage $V_{sub}$ is the potential difference across the NMOS source-substrate junction. To prevent the junction from turning on and triggering latch-up, this voltage must remain below the specified maximum. The condition is:\n$$V_{sub} < V_{sub}^{\\max}$$\nSubstituting the expression from Ohm's Law gives:\n$$I_{inj} R_{sub} < V_{sub}^{\\max}$$\nWe seek the maximum allowable resistance, $R_{sub}^{\\max}$, which corresponds to the boundary condition where the substrate potential just reaches the maximum allowed value:\n$$I_{inj} R_{sub}^{\\max} = V_{sub}^{\\max}$$\nSolving for $R_{sub}^{\\max}$ yields:\n$$R_{sub}^{\\max} = \\frac{V_{sub}^{\\max}}{I_{inj}}$$\nThe problem provides the values for these parameters. The injected current must be expressed in base SI units (Amperes) for consistency.\n$$I_{inj} = 80 \\text{ mA} = 80 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ A} = 0.080 \\text{ A}$$\n$$V_{sub}^{\\max} = 0.6 \\text{ V}$$\nSubstituting these numerical values into the equation for $R_{sub}^{\\max}$:\n$$R_{sub}^{\\max} = \\frac{0.6 \\text{ V}}{0.080 \\text{ A}} = 7.5 \\text{ }\\Omega$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The value $7.5$ can be written as $7.50$ to explicitly show this precision. Therefore, the maximum allowable substrate resistance to reliably prevent latch-up under these worst-case conditions is $7.50 \\text{ }\\Omega$.",

It represents a standard engineering decision-making process involving trade-offs between performance, reliability, and cost (area). I will proceed with the analysis.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe phenomenon of latch-up in bulk CMOS technology arises from the formation of a parasitic p-n-p-n thyristor, or Silicon Controlled Rectifier (SCR). This structure is formed by a parasitic vertical $p-n-p$ bipolar junction transistor (BJT) and a parasitic lateral $n-p-n$ BJT. The collector of each transistor feeds the base of the other, creating a positive feedback loop. If this loop is triggered and the gain is sufficient, a low-impedance, high-current path is formed between $V_{DD}$ and ground, which can cause device failure.\n\nMitigation strategies aim to either prevent triggering or to break the sustaining condition for this feedback loop. The primary principles are:\n1.  **Reduce Parasitic Resistances**: The bases of the parasitic BJTs are the $n$-well and the $p$-substrate (or $p$-well). These nodes are shunted to $V_{DD}$ and ground, respectively, through parasitic resistances ($R_{well}$ and $R_{sub}$). A triggering event, such as an overvoltage spike or an ion strike, injects current that flows through these resistances. If the resulting voltage drop ($I \\cdot R$) is sufficient to forward-bias a base-emitter junction (approximately $V_{BE} \\ge 0.7\\,\\mathrm{V}$), the transistor turns on, initiating the latch-up sequence. Reducing $R_{well}$ and $R_{sub}$ increases the trigger current ($I_T$) required to induce this voltage drop, thereby improving latch-up immunity.\n2.  **Reduce Parasitic BJT Gains**: The condition to sustain latch-up depends on the product of the current gains, $\\beta_{npn} \\cdot \\beta_{pnp}$. Reducing these gains makes it more difficult to sustain the latch-up state.\n\nThe problem requires selecting an option that best satisfies three constraints:\n1.  Area Overhead $\\le 15\\%$\n2.  $\\sigma(60) \\le 1.0\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{cm^2/device}$\n3.  $I_{T} \\ge 80\\,\\mathrm{mA}$\n\nWe will now evaluate each option against these three constraints. For the trigger current $I_T$, we note that a first-order approximation relates it to the parasitic resistances as $I_{T,well} \\approx V_{BE} / R_{well}$ and $I_{T,sub} \\approx V_{BE} / R_{sub}$. To meet the specification $I_T \\ge 80\\,\\mathrm{mA}$, the resistances must be below a certain threshold. The worst-case trigger current will be determined by the larger of the two resistances. Therefore, a lower value for $\\max(R_{well}, R_{sub})$ indicates superior latch-up immunity. The requirement of $I_T \\ge 80\\,\\mathrm{mA}$ implies $R \\le V_{BE} / I_T = 0.7\\,\\mathrm{V} / 0.08\\,\\mathrm{A} = 8.75\\,\\Omega$. None of the options achieve resistances this low, which reinforces the interpretation that we must choose the *best* available option that satisfies the other, non-negotiable constraints.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.

The deep $n$-well isolates the device from the substrate, affecting charge collection paths and reducing $\\beta_{pnp}$. The added $p$-well taps effectively reduce $R_{well}$. Both resistances are significantly lower than the baseline ($28\\,\\Omega$ and $35\\,\\Omega$). The maximum resistance is $24\\,\\Omega$. This represents a significant improvement in latch-up hardness over the baseline. Based on the simple model, the worst-case trigger current is $I_T \\approx 0.7\\,\\mathrm{V} / 24\\,\\Omega \\approx 29.2\\,\\mathrm{mA}$.\n\n**Verdict for A**: This option satisfies both the area and SE-LU cross-section constraints.\n\n**B. Increased $p^{+}$ guard ring density surrounding $n^{+}$ diffusions and along well edges.**\n- **Area Overhead**: $12\\%$. This is $\\le 15\\%$. **Constraint is met.**\n- **SE-LU Cross-section**: $\\sigma(60)=2.0\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{cm^2/device}$. This is *greater than* the maximum allowed $1.0\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{cm^2/device}$. **Constraint is NOT met.**\n- **Trigger Current**: This option provides $R_{well}=14\\,\\Omega$ but leaves $R_{sub}=35\\,\\Omega$ unchanged from the baseline. While the $p^{+}$ guard ring effectively reduces $R_{well}$, the substrate resistance remains high. The chain is only as strong as its weakest link; immunity is limited by the larger resistance, $R_{sub}=35\\,\\Omega$.\n\n**Verdict for B**: This option is unacceptable because it fails to meet the SE-LU cross-section requirement.\n\n**C. Deep $n$-well across the entire pad ring without added $p$-well taps.**\n- **Area Overhead**: $18\\%$. This is *greater than* the maximum allowed $15\\%$. **Constraint is NOT met.**\n- **SE-LU Cross-section**: $\\sigma(60)=7.0\\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{cm^2/device}$. This is $\\le 1.0\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{cm^2/device}$. **Constraint is met.**\n- **Trigger Current**: This option provides $R_{sub}=20\\,\\Omega$ but increases the well resistance to $R_{well}=30.8\\,\\Omega$. This increase is likely due to the deep $n$-well structure increasing the path length for well contacts without the addition of dedicated taps. The worst-case resistance is $30.8\\,\\Omega$.\n\n**Verdict for C**: This option is unacceptable because it fails to meet the area overhead budget.\n\n**D. Increased $p^{+}$ guard ring density plus an additional $n^{+}$ guard ring near $p$-well edges.**\n- **Area Overhead**: $16\\%$. This is *greater than* the maximum allowed $15\\%$. **Constraint is NOT met.**\n- **SE-LU Cross-section**: $\\sigma(60)=1.2\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{cm^2/device}$. This is *greater than* the maximum allowed $1.0\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{cm^2/device}$. **Constraint is NOT met.**\n- **Trigger Current**: This option results in resistances of $R_{well}=14\\,\\Omega$ and $R_{sub}=35\\,\\Omega$.\n\n**Verdict for D**: This option is unacceptable because it fails to meet both the area and the SE-LU cross-section requirements.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nA systematic evaluation of the four options against the three specified constraints leads to a clear conclusion.\n- Option B is eliminated for failing the SE-LU cross-section constraint.\n- Option C is eliminated for failing the area overhead constraint.\n- Option D is eliminated for failing both the area and SE-LU cross-section constraints.\n\nOnly Option A successfully satisfies the stringent constraints on both area overhead and SE-LU cross-section. While a simplified calculation suggests it may not meet the $80\\,\\mathrm{mA}$ trigger current target, it is the only viable option presented. Furthermore, it provides the best overall trigger current immunity of all the options, as indicated by having the lowest maximum parasitic resistance ($\\max(22\\,\\Omega, 24\\,\\Omega) = 24\\,\\Omega$, compared to $35\\,\\Omega$, $30.8\\,\\Omega$, and $35\\,\\Omega$ for options B, C, and D, respectively). Therefore, it is unequivocally the option that *best satisfies all three constraints simultaneously*.\n\nThe chosen mitigation strategy, a deep $n$-well under the I/O cells combined with distributed $p$-well taps, provides a balanced improvement. The deep $n$-well provides substrate isolation improving radiation hardness ($\\sigma$) and reducing vertical PNP gain ($\\beta_{pnp}$). The distributed taps directly attack the well resistance ($R_{well}$), improving the trigger current. This combination effectively hardens the device against latch-up while staying within the specified area and SE-LU budgets.\n\n**Final Verdict per Option:**\n- **A. Correct**. It is the only option that satisfies the area and SE-LU cross-section constraints. It also offers the most balanced and significant improvement to latch-up immunity as measured by parasitic resistances.\n- **B. Incorrect**. Fails the SE-LU cross-section constraint.\n- **C. Incorrect**. Fails the area overhead constraint.\n- **D. Incorrect**. Fails both area and SE-LU cross-section constraints.",
