            "problem": "A segment of a clock distribution network in Integrated Circuits and Electronic Design Automation (EDA) is routed as a uniform metal wire of geometric length $L$ on a single layer whose resistance per unit length is $R'$ and capacitance per unit length is $C'$. Assume an ideal step source (Thevenin resistance $0$) drives the near end, the far end is observed at the receiving pin whose input conductance is negligible, and the wire is modeled as a passive linear time-invariant distributed $RC$ network. In Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS), waveform propagation is commonly estimated by matching low-frequency moments of the impulse response and using Sakurai’s approximation to obtain a closed-form surrogate step response and associated delay and slew.\n\nStarting from fundamental definitions of moments of the impulse response of linear networks and the Elmore delay, derive a closed-form expression for the far-end $50\\%$ propagation delay (time to cross $0.5$ of the final value) and the $10$–$90$ rise slew (difference in times to cross $0.1$ and $0.9$ of the final value) using Sakurai’s approximation applied to a $\\pi$-model that matches the first moment of the distributed wire.

Express the answers in seconds. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the $50\\%$ propagation delay and the $10-90\\%$ rise slew for a uniform distributed RC line, using a specific approximation method. The method involves modeling the distributed line with a $\\pi$-model that matches the first moment of the impulse response, and then applying Sakurai's approximation for the step response.\n\nFirst, we establish the properties of the uniform distributed RC line. The line has a length $L$, resistance per unit length $R'$, and capacitance per unit length $C'$. The total resistance is $R = R'L$ and the total capacitance is $C = C'L$. The line is driven by an ideal voltage source (zero Thevenin resistance) and the far end is an open circuit. The behavior of this system is described by the telegrapher's equations for an RC line. The voltage transfer function $H(s) = V_{out}(s) / V_{in}(s)$ relating the far-end voltage to the near-end voltage in the Laplace domain is a standard result:\n$$\nH(s) = \\frac{1}{\\cosh(\\gamma L)}\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma = \\sqrt{sR'C'}$ is the propagation constant. Substituting $R = R'L$ and $C = C'L$, we can write $\\gamma L = \\sqrt{s(R'L)(C'L)} = \\sqrt{sRC}$. Thus, the transfer function is:\n$$\nH_{dist}(s) = \\frac{1}{\\cosh(\\sqrt{sRC})}\n$$\n\nThe next step is to find the first moment of the impulse response, $h_{dist}(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}[H_{dist}(s)]$. The moments $M_k$ are defined by $M_k = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t^k h(t) dt$. They can be calculated from the Maclaurin series expansion of the transfer function, $H(s) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^k}{k!} M_k s^k = M_0 - M_1 s + \\frac{M_2}{2}s^2 - \\dots$. We need $M_1$. To find it, we expand $H_{dist}(s)$ for small $s$.\nThe Maclaurin series for $\\cosh(x)$ is $1 + \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\frac{x^4}{4!} + \\dots$. Let $x = \\sqrt{sRC}$.\n$$\n\\cosh(\\sqrt{sRC}) = 1 + \\frac{(\\sqrt{sRC})^2}{2} + \\frac{(\\sqrt{sRC})^4}{24} + \\dots = 1 + \\frac{sRC}{2} + \\frac{s^2(RC)^2}{24} + \\dots\n$$\nSubstituting this into the transfer function:\n$$\nH_{dist}(s) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{sRC}{2} + O(s^2)}\n$$\nUsing the geometric series expansion $\\frac{1}{1+u} \\approx 1 - u$ for small $u$:\n$$\nH_{dist}(s) \\approx 1 - \\frac{sRC}{2} + O(s^2)\n$$\nComparing this to the moment expansion $H(s) = M_0 - M_1 s + \\dots$, we identify $M_0 = 1$ (the DC gain) and $M_1 = \\frac{RC}{2}$. This first moment, $M_1$, is the Elmore delay of the distributed line. Substituting back $R=R'L$ and $C=C'L$:\n$$\nM_{1,dist} = \\frac{(R'L)(C'L)}{2} = \\frac{R'C'L^2}{2}\n$$\n\nThe problem specifies using a $\\pi$-model that matches this first moment. A standard symmetric $\\pi$-model for a wire segment of total resistance $R$ and total capacitance $C$ consists of a series resistor of value $R$ placed between two shunt capacitors, each of value $C/2$. The circuit is driven by an ideal voltage source $V_{in}$ at the input node. The first capacitor $C/2$ is connected between the input node and ground. Because the source is ideal, it maintains the input node at voltage $V_{in}$ regardless of the current drawn by this capacitor. Therefore, this first capacitor does not affect the voltage transfer function to the output. The rest of the circuit consists of the series resistor $R$ connected between the input node and the output node, and the second capacitor $C/2$ connected between the output node and ground. This is a simple first-order RC low-pass filter with resistance $R$ and capacitance $C_{load} = C/2$.\nThe transfer function of this effective model is:\n$$\nH_{\\pi}(s) = \\frac{1}{1 + s R (C/2)} = \\frac{1}{1 + s \\frac{RC}{2}}\n$$\nLet's find the first moment of this model's impulse response. Expanding for small $s$:\n$$\nH_{\\pi}(s) \\approx 1 - s \\frac{RC}{2} + O(s^2)\n$$\nThe first moment is $M_{1,\\pi} = \\frac{RC}{2}$. This exactly matches the first moment of the distributed line, $M_{1,dist}$. Thus, the chosen $\\pi$-model is appropriate as per the problem statement. The effective time constant of this model is $\\tau = M_1 = \\frac{RC}{2} = \\frac{R'C'L^2}{2}$.\n\nSakurai's approximation for the step response $v(t)$ of a system with impulse response first moment $m_1$ is given by a single-pole approximation:\n$$\nv(t) \\approx 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{m_1}\\right)\n$$\nFor our system, $m_1 = \\frac{R'C'L^2}{2}$. So, the approximated step response at the far end is:\n$$\nv_{out}(t) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{R'C'L^2/2}\\right) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2t}{R'C'L^2}\\right)\n$$\n\nNow we can calculate the required timing metrics. The step amplitude is normalized to $1$.\n\n1.  **$50\\%$ Propagation Delay ($t_{50\\%}$):**\n    This is the time $t$ at which $v_{out}(t) = 0.5$.\n    $$\n    0.5 = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2 t_{50\\%}}{R'C'L^2}\\right)\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2 t_{50\\%}}{R'C'L^2}\\right) = 0.5\n    $$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $$\n    -\\frac{2 t_{50\\%}}{R'C'L^2} = \\ln(0.5) = -\\ln(2)\n    $$\n    $$\n    t_{50\\%} = \\frac{R'C'L^2}{2} \\ln(2)\n    $$\n\n2.  **$10\\%-90\\%$ Rise Slew ($t_{slew}$):**\n    This is defined as $t_{90\\%} - t_{10\\%}$.\n    First, find the time to reach $90\\%$ of the final value, $t_{90\\%}$:\n    $$\n    0.9 = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2 t_{90\\%}}{R'C'L^2}\\right) \\implies \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2 t_{90\\%}}{R'C'L^2}\\right) = 0.1\n    $$\n    $$\n    -\\frac{2 t_{90\\%}}{R'C'L^2} = \\ln(0.1) = -\\ln(10) \\implies t_{90\\%} = \\frac{R'C'L^2}{2} \\ln(10)\n    $$\n    Next, find the time to reach $10\\%$ of the final value, $t_{10\\%}$:\n    $$\n    0.1 = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2 t_{10\\%}}{R'C'L^2}\\right) \\implies \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2 t_{10\\%}}{R'C'L^2}\\right) = 0.9\n    $$\n    $$\n    -\\frac{2 t_{10\\%}}{R'C'L^2} = \\ln(0.9) \\implies t_{10\\%} = \\frac{R'C'L^2}{2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{0.9}\\right) = \\frac{R'C'L^2}{2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{10}{9}\\right)\n    $$\n    The slew is the difference:\n    $$\n    t_{slew} = t_{90\\%} - t_{10\\%} = \\frac{R'C'L^2}{2} \\ln(10) - \\frac{R'C'L^2}{2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{10}{9}\\right)\n    $$\n    $$\n    t_{slew} = \\frac{R'C'L^2}{2} \\left[ \\ln(10) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{10}{9}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{R'C'L^2}{2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{10}{10/9}\\right) = \\frac{R'C'L^2}{2} \\ln(9)\n    $$\n    Since $\\ln(9) = \\ln(3^2) = 2\\ln(3)$, we can simplify this to:\n    $$\n    t_{slew} = \\frac{R'C'L^2}{2} (2\\ln(3)) = R'C'L^2 \\ln(3)\n    $$\n\n**Qualitative Discussion on Accuracy:**\nA high-fidelity SPICE simulation would model the distributed RC line as a fine-grained cascade of many small resistor-capacitor segments (a ladder network), which provides a much more accurate approximation of the continuous system than our single $\\pi$-model. The single $\\pi$-model results in a first-order system, whereas the distributed line is an infinite-order system.\n\nA key discrepancy arises from the fact that the first-moment matching captures the dominant, low-frequency behavior but completely ignores the higher-frequency poles of the distributed line. The true step response of a distributed RC line has an initial slope of zero, a characteristic feature of systems with an infinite number of poles. In contrast, the first-order model's step response, $1 - \\exp(-t/\\tau)$, has a non-zero initial slope of $1/\\tau$ at $t=0$. This fundamental difference in waveform shape leads to inaccuracies.\n\nThe derived $50\\%$ delay, $t_{50\\%} = (\\ln 2) M_1 \\approx 0.693 M_1$, is a well-known formula. For a distributed RC line, the true $50\\%$ delay is approximately $0.38 RC = 0.76 M_1$. Our formula gives $0.3465 RC$. The model underestimates the delay.\n\nThe slew is even more sensitive to the waveform shape. The first-order model tends to overestimate the initial rise speed and underestimate the long tail of the response. Our derived slew is $t_{slew} = (\\ln 9) M_1 \\approx 2.2 M_1 = 1.1 RC$. The accurate value for the distributed line is closer to $0.9 RC$. So, the model overestimates the $10-90\\%$ slew.\n\nThe accuracy of this approximation degrades as the length of the wire $L$ increases. The 'distributedness' of the line is governed by the total $RC$ product, which is $R'C'L^2$. As $L$ increases, this product grows quadratically. A larger $RC$ product means the higher-order poles, which are ignored by the first-order approximation, play a more significant role in shaping the waveform. Therefore, for longer wires, the discrepancy between the predictions of the simple model and the results of a SPICE simulation will be larger. For short wires, where the behavior is closer to that of a lumped capacitor, the approximation is more reasonable.",

            "problem": "A global clock trunk in an Electronic Design Automation (EDA) flow must distribute a clock signal across a uniform on-chip interconnect of length $L$ characterized by per-unit resistance $R'$ and per-unit capacitance $C'$. The interconnect is driven from an ideal voltage source at the near end and terminates at a single sink with input capacitance $C_{L}$. To mitigate the resistive-capacitive delay along the wire, you may insert $N$ identical repeaters (buffers), evenly spaced along the wire. Each buffer is modeled as a linear driver with output resistance $R_{b}$, input capacitance $C_{b}$, and intrinsic delay $t_{b}$. Assume the wire segments between successive buffers (and between the source and the first buffer, and between the last buffer and the sink) all have equal length. Model each wire segment delay using the Elmore delay of a distributed uniform line driven by a resistive source and feeding a lumped load at its far end. Specifically, for a segment of length $\\ell$, driven by a source resistance $R_{s}$ into a load capacitance $C_{\\text{load}}$, the Elmore delay from the segment input to its far end is $R_{s}(C' \\ell + C_{\\text{load}}) + \\frac{1}{2} R' C' \\ell^{2} + R' \\ell C_{\\text{load}}$.\n\nUnder these assumptions, derive from first principles the total source-to-sink delay as a function of $N$, and then determine the optimal real-valued $N$ that minimizes this delay.

This is equivalent to having two distributed $RC$ segments in series.\n-   Segment 1: The original wire with resistance $R_1 = R'L_0$ and capacitance $C_1 = C'L_0$.\n-   Segment 2: The meander with resistance $R_2 = R'\\ell$ and capacitance $C_2 = C'\\ell$.\nThe structure is $R_{\\mathrm{buf}} \\to \\text{Segment 1} \\to \\text{Segment 2} \\to C_L$.\n\nUsing the path-based Elmore formulation, the new total delay, $t'_{\\mathcal{B}}$, is the sum of delays across each resistive element:\n$$\nt'_{\\mathcal{B}} = R_{\\mathrm{buf}}(C_1+C_2+C_L) + R'L_0\\left(\\frac{C'L_0}{2} + C_2+C_L\\right) + R'\\ell\\left(\\frac{C_2}{2} + C_L\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for resistance and capacitance:\n$$\nt'_{\\mathcal{B}} = R_{\\mathrm{buf}}(C'L_0 + C'\\ell + C_L) + R'L_0\\left(\\frac{C'L_0}{2} + C'\\ell + C_L\\right) + R'\\ell\\left(\\frac{C'\\ell}{2} + C_L\\right)\n$$\n\nThe incremental delay, $\\Delta t(\\ell)$, is the difference between the new delay and the original delay: $\\Delta t(\\ell) = t'_{\\mathcal{B}} - t_{\\mathcal{B}}$.\n$$\n\\Delta t(\\ell) = \\left[R_{\\mathrm{buf}}(C'L_0 + C'\\ell + C_L) + R'L_0\\left(\\frac{C'L_0}{2} + C'\\ell + C_L\\right) + R'\\ell\\left(\\frac{C'\\ell}{2} + C_L\\right)\\right] - \\left[R_{\\mathrm{buf}}(C'L_0 + C_L) + R'L_0\\left(\\frac{C'L_0}{2} + C_L\\right)\\right]\n$$\nMany terms cancel out. Let's expand and collect the remaining terms:\n$$\n\\Delta t(\\ell) = R_{\\mathrm{buf}}(C'\\ell) + R'L_0(C'\\ell) + R'\\ell\\left(\\frac{C'\\ell}{2} + C_L\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta t(\\ell) = R_{\\mathrm{buf}}C'\\ell + R'L_0C'\\ell + \\frac{1}{2}R'C'\\ell^2 + R'C_L\\ell\n$$\nThis expression can be arranged as a quadratic function of $\\ell$:\n$$\n\\Delta t(\\ell) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}R'C'\\right)\\ell^2 + \\left(R_{\\mathrm{buf}}C' + R'L_0C' + R'C_L\\right)\\ell\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta t(\\ell) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}R'C'\\right)\\ell^2 + \\left((R_{\\mathrm{buf}} + R'L_0)C' + R'C_L\\right)\\ell\n$$\nWe need to find the minimal length $\\ell$, denoted $\\ell_{\\min}$, such that $\\Delta t(\\ell_{\\min}) = \\Delta t_{\\text{req}}$. This gives the quadratic equation:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{1}{2}R'C'\\right)\\ell^2 + \\left((R_{\\mathrm{buf}} + R'L_0)C' + R'C_L\\right)\\ell - \\Delta t_{\\text{req}} = 0\n$$\nTo solve this, we will use a consistent set of units. Let's use resistance in $\\Omega$, length in $\\mu\\text{m}$, capacitance in $\\text{fF}$, and time in $\\text{ps}$. The conversion factor for time is $1\\,\\text{ps} = 1000\\,\\Omega \\cdot \\text{fF}$.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n$R_{\\mathrm{buf}} = 100\\,\\Omega$\n$L_{0} = 800\\,\\mu\\text{m}$\n$R' = 0.10\\,\\Omega/\\mu\\text{m}$\n$C' = 0.25\\,\\text{fF}/\\mu\\text{m}$\n$C_{L} = 12\\,\\text{fF}$\n$\\Delta t_{\\text{req}} = 28\\,\\text{ps}$\n\nLet the quadratic equation be $a\\ell^2 + b\\ell + c = 0$. The coefficients $a$ and $b$ are calculated from the delay expression, and $c = -\\Delta t_{\\text{req}}$.\nFirst, calculate the coefficients $a$ and $b$ in units of $\\Omega\\cdot\\text{fF}$ per powers of $\\mu\\text{m}$.\n$$\na_{\\Omega\\text{fF}} = \\frac{1}{2}R'C' = \\frac{1}{2}(0.10\\,\\Omega/\\mu\\text{m})(0.25\\,\\text{fF}/\\mu\\text{m}) = 0.0125\\,\\frac{\\Omega \\cdot \\text{fF}}{(\\mu\\text{m})^2}\n$$\nThe resistance of the existing wire is $R'L_0 = (0.10\\,\\Omega/\\mu\\text{m})(800\\,\\mu\\text{m}) = 80\\,\\Omega$.\n$$\nb_{\\Omega\\text{fF}} = (R_{\\mathrm{buf}} + R'L_0)C' + R'C_L = (100\\,\\Omega + 80\\,\\Omega)(0.25\\,\\text{fF}/\\mu\\text{m}) + (0.10\\,\\Omega/\\mu\\text{m})(12\\,\\text{fF})\n$$\n$$\nb_{\\Omega\\text{fF}} = (180\\,\\Omega)(0.25\\,\\text{fF}/\\mu\\text{m}) + 1.2\\,\\frac{\\Omega \\cdot \\text{fF}}{\\mu\\text{m}} = 45\\,\\frac{\\Omega \\cdot \\text{fF}}{\\mu\\text{m}} + 1.2\\,\\frac{\\Omega \\cdot \\text{fF}}{\\mu\\text{m}} = 46.2\\,\\frac{\\Omega \\cdot \\text{fF}}{\\mu\\text{m}}\n$$\nThe incremental delay in units of $\\Omega \\cdot \\text{fF}$ is $\\Delta t(\\ell) = 0.0125\\ell^2 + 46.2\\ell$.\nWe need this delay to be $28\\,\\text{ps}$. We convert ps to $\\Omega \\cdot \\text{fF}$:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\text{req}} = 28\\,\\text{ps} \\times \\frac{1000\\,\\Omega \\cdot \\text{fF}}{1\\,\\text{ps}} = 28000\\,\\Omega \\cdot \\text{fF}\n$$\nNow we solve the equation for $\\ell$ (in $\\mu\\text{m}$):\n$$\n0.0125\\ell^2 + 46.2\\ell - 28000 = 0\n$$\nUsing the quadratic formula for $\\ell = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with $a=0.0125$, $b=46.2$, and $c=-28000$:\n$$\n\\ell = \\frac{-46.2 \\pm \\sqrt{(46.2)^2 - 4(0.0125)(-28000)}}{2(0.0125)}\n$$\n$$\n\\ell = \\frac{-46.2 \\pm \\sqrt{2134.44 + 1400}}{0.025}\n$$\n$$\n\\ell = \\frac{-46.2 \\pm \\sqrt{3534.44}}{0.025}\n$$\nSince length $\\ell$ must be positive, we take the positive root:\n$$\n\\ell = \\frac{-46.2 + 59.451156...}{0.025} = \\frac{13.251156...}{0.025} = 530.04624...\n$$\nThe minimal added length is $\\ell_{\\min} \\approx 530.046\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\nRounding to three significant figures, the minimal length is $530.\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.
