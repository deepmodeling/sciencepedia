            "problem": "Consider an on-chip interconnect modeled as a straight, uniform rectangular wire of length $L$, width $w$, and thickness $t$, made of a conductive material with resistivity $\\rho$. The wire connects an ideal step-voltage source (zero source resistance) at its near end to a capacitive load at its far end. The metal is assumed non-magnetic and the interconnect is operated in a regime where inductive effects are negligible; therefore, the line can be modeled as a distributed resistor-capacitor network with per-unit-length resistance $r=\\rho/(t w)$ and per-unit-length capacitance to ground $c_{w}$. The far-end capacitive load is modeled as a single lumped capacitance $c_{f}$ connected at $x=L$.\n\nDefine the delay metric at the far-end node using the first moment of the linear time-invariant impulse response (the Elmore delay). Starting from fundamental definitions appropriate to resistive-capacitive networks and the continuous limit of a uniform distributed line, derive the Elmore delay prediction for the far-end node when the wire is treated as a distributed resistor-capacitor line. Separately, form a lumped model by collapsing the wire into a single series resistance $R_{\\text{wire}}=rL$ feeding a single lumped capacitance $C_{\\text{tot}}=c_{f}+c_{w}L$ at the far end, and derive the corresponding single-pole delay prediction using the same delay metric.\n\nUsing these two predictions, define the relative error of the lumped prediction with respect to the distributed prediction as the ratio of the absolute difference to the distributed prediction. Determine the critical length $\\ell$ (as a closed-form symbolic expression in terms of $c_{f}$ and $c_{w}$) beyond which the lumped model’s delay prediction exceeds $0.10$ relative error. Express the final length in meters. No numerical values are provided; your final answer must be a single analytic expression. Do not assume any additional parasitics or source resistance beyond those stated, and do not invoke inductive effects.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed a well-posed, scientifically sound problem in the field of integrated circuit design and analysis. The solution proceeds as follows.\n\nThe primary objective is to determine the critical length $\\ell$ of an interconnect at which a simple lumped RC model's delay prediction deviates from the more accurate distributed RC model's prediction by a specified relative error of $0.10$. The delay metric is the Elmore delay.\n\nFirst, we derive the Elmore delay for the distributed RC line. The Elmore delay at a node $i$ in an RC network is defined as $\\tau_{D,i} = \\sum_k R_{ik} C_k$, where $C_k$ is the capacitance at node $k$ and $R_{ik}$ is the resistance of the path from the voltage source to node $i$ that is shared with the path from the source to node $k$. For a continuous distributed line, this sum becomes an integral.\n\nThe interconnect has a length $L$, a per-unit-length resistance $r$, and a per-unit-length capacitance $c_w$. At the far end, $x=L$, there is a lumped load capacitance $c_f$. We want to find the delay at this far-end node.\n\nThe total capacitance consists of two parts: the distributed capacitance of the wire itself and the lumped capacitance at the far end.\n1. Contribution from the distributed wire capacitance: Consider an infinitesimal segment of the wire of length $dx'$ at position $x'$ from the source ($0 \\le x' \\le L$). This segment has a capacitance $dC = c_w dx'$. The resistance of the path shared by the source-to-far-end ($x=L$) path and the source-to-$x'$ path is the resistance from the source to $x'$, which is $R(x') = r x'$. The contribution to the Elmore delay from this infinitesimal capacitance is $d\\tau = R(x') dC = (r x') (c_w dx')$. To find the total contribution from the entire wire, we integrate from $x'=0$ to $x'=L$:\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{wire}} = \\int_0^L (r x') (c_w dx') = r c_w \\int_0^L x' dx' = r c_w \\left[ \\frac{x'^2}{2} \\right]_0^L = \\frac{1}{2} r c_w L^2 $$\n2. Contribution from the far-end load capacitance $c_f$: This capacitance is located at $x=L$. The resistance of the path from the source to $c_f$ is the total resistance of the wire, $R_{\\text{wire}} = rL$. This entire path is common with the path to the far-end node itself. Thus, the contribution from $c_f$ is:\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{load}} = (rL) c_f $$\n\nThe total Elmore delay for the distributed model, $T_{D, \\text{dist}}$, is the sum of these two contributions:\n$$ T_{D, \\text{dist}}(L) = \\tau_{\\text{wire}} + \\tau_{\\text{load}} = \\frac{1}{2} r c_w L^2 + r L c_f $$\n\nNext, we derive the delay for the lumped L-model. In this model, the entire wire resistance is lumped into a single series resistor $R_{\\text{wire}} = rL$, and the entire wire capacitance is lumped with the load capacitance into a single capacitor at the far end, $C_{\\text{tot}} = c_w L + c_f$. This forms a simple first-order RC circuit. The Elmore delay for such a circuit is equivalent to its time constant, which is the product of the resistance and the capacitance.\n$$ T_{D, \\text{lump}}(L) = R_{\\text{wire}} C_{\\text{tot}} = (rL) (c_w L + c_f) = r c_w L^2 + r L c_f $$\n\nNow, we define the relative error of the lumped model prediction with respect to the distributed model prediction.\n$$ \\text{Error}(L) = \\frac{|T_{D, \\text{lump}}(L) - T_{D, \\text{dist}}(L)|}{T_{D, \\text{dist}}(L)} $$\nThe difference in the delay predictions is:\n$$ T_{D, \\text{lump}}(L) - T_{D, \\text{dist}}(L) = (r c_w L^2 + r L c_f) - \\left(\\frac{1}{2} r c_w L^2 + r L c_f\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} r c_w L^2 $$\nSince $r$, $c_w$, and $L$ are all positive physical quantities, this difference is always positive, so the absolute value is not necessary.\nSubstituting the expressions into the error formula:\n$$ \\text{Error}(L) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} r c_w L^2}{\\frac{1}{2} r c_w L^2 + r L c_f} $$\nWe can simplify this expression by dividing the numerator and denominator by $rL$ (assuming $L>0$):\n$$ \\text{Error}(L) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} c_w L}{\\frac{1}{2} c_w L + c_f} $$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $2$ gives a cleaner form:\n$$ \\text{Error}(L) = \\frac{c_w L}{c_w L + 2 c_f} $$\n\nFinally, we must find the critical length $\\ell$ beyond which this relative error exceeds $0.10$. We find the boundary case by setting the error equal to $0.10$ for $L=\\ell$.\n$$ \\frac{c_w \\ell}{c_w \\ell + 2 c_f} = 0.10 = \\frac{1}{10} $$\nNow, we solve for $\\ell$:\n$$ 10 c_w \\ell = 1 (c_w \\ell + 2 c_f) $$\n$$ 10 c_w \\ell = c_w \\ell + 2 c_f $$\n$$ 9 c_w \\ell = 2 c_f $$\n$$ \\ell = \\frac{2 c_f}{9 c_w} $$\nThe error function $\\text{Error}(L)$ is monotonically increasing with $L$ for $L>0$. Therefore, for any length $L > \\ell$, the relative error will exceed $0.10$. The expression for the critical length $\\ell$ is thus determined. The units are consistent, as $c_f$ is in Farads (F) and $c_w$ is in Farads per meter (F/m), yielding a result for $\\ell$ in meters.",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically validated and is deemed to be scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. All provided data and conditions are consistent with the established principles of circuit theory and the analysis of distributed parameter systems. The problem is a standard, non-trivial exercise in modeling on-chip interconnects. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part analysis: first, the computation of the Elmore delay for a uniform distributed RC line; second, the derivation of the exact first moment of the impulse response from the line's transfer function; and third, a comparison of these two quantities.\n\n**1. Elmore Delay Calculation**\n\nThe Elmore delay is a first-order approximation of the propagation delay in an RC tree. For a specific node $i$, it is defined as the sum of the resistances of each path segment from the source to any other node $k$, weighted by the capacitance at node $k$, where the path segment is also part of the path from the source to node $i$. The formula is $T_{D,i} = \\sum_k R_{ik} C_k$.\n\nFor a continuous, uniform distributed RC line of length $\\ell$, this summation becomes an integral. The output node is at $x=\\ell$. We consider an infinitesimal segment of the line of length $dx$ at a position $x$ from the source (where $0 \\le x \\le \\ell$).\nThe capacitance of this infinitesimal segment is $dC = c \\, dx$, where $c$ is the per-unit-length capacitance.\nThe resistance in the path from the source (at $x=0$) to the far end (at $x=\\ell$) that is shared with the path to the segment at position $x$ is simply the resistance from the source to position $x$. This resistance, which we denote $R(x)$, is given by $R(x) = r x$, where $r$ is the per-unit-length resistance.\n\nAccording to the definition, the Elmore delay at the far end, which we denote $T_{\\text{Elmore}}$, is obtained by integrating the product of the path resistance $R(x)$ and the infinitesimal capacitance $dC$ over the entire length of the line:\n$$T_{\\text{Elmore}} = \\int_{0}^{\\ell} R(x) \\, dC(x) = \\int_{0}^{\\ell} (rx)(c \\, dx)$$\nWe can factor out the constants $r$ and $c$:\n$$T_{\\text{Elmore}} = rc \\int_{0}^{\\ell} x \\, dx$$\nPerforming the integration yields:\n$$T_{\\text{Elmore}} = rc \\left[ \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right]_{0}^{\\ell} = rc \\left( \\frac{\\ell^2}{2} - 0 \\right)$$\nThus, the Elmore delay for the far-end node is:\n$$T_{\\text{Elmore}} = \\frac{rc\\ell^2}{2}$$\n\n**2. Exact First Moment from the Transfer Function**\n\nTo find the exact first moment of the impulse response, we must first derive the transfer function $H(s)$ of the distributed RC line. We start with the telegrapher's equations in the Laplace domain for a line with negligible inductance ($L=0$) and negligible conductance to ground ($G=0$). Let $V(x,s)$ and $I(x,s)$ be the Laplace transforms of the voltage and current at position $x$.\nThe equations are:\n$$\\frac{dV(x,s)}{dx} = -rI(x,s)$$\n$$\\frac{dI(x,s)}{dx} = -scV(x,s)$$\nDifferentiating the first equation with respect to $x$ and substituting the second equation gives a second-order ordinary differential equation for $V(x,s)$:\n$$\\frac{d^2V(x,s)}{dx^2} = -r\\frac{dI(x,s)}{dx} = -r(-scV(x,s)) = (src)V(x,s)$$\nLet us define the propagation constant $\\gamma(s) = \\sqrt{src}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\\frac{d^2V(x,s)}{dx^2} - \\gamma^2(s)V(x,s) = 0$$\nThe general solution to this equation is:\n$$V(x,s) = A e^{\\gamma(s)x} + B e^{-\\gamma(s)x}$$\nThe coefficients $A$ and $B$ are determined by the boundary conditions.\nAt the input ($x=0$), a unit step voltage is applied, so its Laplace transform is $V(0,s) = 1/s$.\n$$V(0,s) = A + B = \\frac{1}{s}$$\nAt the far end ($x=\\ell$), the line is unterminated (open circuit), which means the current is zero: $I(\\ell,s)=0$. We can express $I(x,s)$ using the first telegrapher's equation:\n$$I(x,s) = -\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{dV(x,s)}{dx} = -\\frac{\\gamma(s)}{r} \\left( A e^{\\gamma(s)x} - B e^{-\\gamma(s)x} \\right)$$\nApplying the zero-current condition at $x=\\ell$:\n$$I(\\ell,s) = -\\frac{\\gamma(s)}{r} \\left( A e^{\\gamma(s)\\ell} - B e^{-\\gamma(s)\\ell} \\right) = 0$$\nThis implies $A e^{\\gamma(s)\\ell} = B e^{-\\gamma(s)\\ell}$, or $A = B e^{-2\\gamma(s)\\ell}$.\nSubstituting this into the equation for $V(0,s)$:\n$$B e^{-2\\gamma(s)\\ell} + B = \\frac{1}{s} \\implies B \\left( 1 + e^{-2\\gamma(s)\\ell} \\right) = \\frac{1}{s}$$\nSolving for $B$:\n$$B = \\frac{1}{s(1 + e^{-2\\gamma(s)\\ell})}$$\nThe output voltage is $V_{\\text{out}}(s) = V(\\ell,s)$:\n$$V(\\ell,s) = A e^{\\gamma(s)\\ell} + B e^{-\\gamma(s)\\ell} = (B e^{-2\\gamma(s)\\ell})e^{\\gamma(s)\\ell} + B e^{-\\gamma(s)\\ell} = 2B e^{-\\gamma(s)\\ell}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $B$:\n$$V(\\ell,s) = \\frac{2 e^{-\\gamma(s)\\ell}}{s(1 + e^{-2\\gamma(s)\\ell})} = \\frac{2}{s(e^{\\gamma(s)\\ell} + e^{-\\gamma(s)\\ell})} = \\frac{1}{s \\cosh(\\gamma(s)\\ell)}$$\nThe transfer function $H(s)$ relates the output transform to the input transform. Since the input was a unit step, $V_{\\text{in}}(s) = 1/s$.\n$$H(s) = \\frac{V_{\\text{out}}(s)}{V_{\\text{in}}(s)} = \\frac{1/(s \\cosh(\\gamma(s)\\ell))}{1/s} = \\frac{1}{\\cosh(\\gamma(s)\\ell)}$$\nSubstituting $\\gamma(s) = \\sqrt{src}$:\n$$H(s) = \\frac{1}{\\cosh(\\ell\\sqrt{rc}\\sqrt{s})}$$\nThe first moment of the impulse response, $m_1$, is given by the derivative of the transfer function evaluated at $s=0$:\n$$m_1 = -\\frac{dH(s)}{ds}\\bigg|_{s=0}$$\nLet's compute the derivative. For simplicity, let $\\alpha = \\ell\\sqrt{rc}$.\n$$H(s) = [\\cosh(\\alpha\\sqrt{s})]^{-1}$$\n$$\\frac{dH}{ds} = -[\\cosh(\\alpha\\sqrt{s})]^{-2} \\cdot \\sinh(\\alpha\\sqrt{s}) \\cdot \\frac{d}{ds}(\\alpha\\sqrt{s})$$\n$$\\frac{dH}{ds} = -\\frac{\\sinh(\\alpha\\sqrt{s})}{\\cosh^2(\\alpha\\sqrt{s})} \\cdot \\frac{\\alpha}{2\\sqrt{s}}$$\nTo evaluate this at $s=0$, we must take the limit as $s \\to 0$. We use the known limits for the component functions:\n$$\\lim_{s \\to 0} \\cosh^2(\\alpha\\sqrt{s}) = \\cosh^2(0) = 1^2 = 1$$\n$$\\lim_{s \\to 0} \\frac{\\sinh(\\alpha\\sqrt{s})}{\\sqrt{s}} = \\lim_{\\theta \\to 0} \\frac{\\sinh(\\alpha\\theta)}{\\theta} = \\alpha$$\nThe second limit can be verified using L'Hôpital's rule or by the Taylor series expansion of $\\sinh(z) \\approx z$ for small $z$.\nCombining these results:\n$$\\frac{dH}{ds}\\bigg|_{s=0} = \\lim_{s \\to 0} \\left( -\\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sinh(\\alpha\\sqrt{s})}{\\sqrt{s}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\cosh^2(\\alpha\\sqrt{s})} \\right) = -\\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\cdot \\alpha \\cdot \\frac{1}{1} = -\\frac{\\alpha^2}{2}$$\nThe first moment, which we denote $T_{\\text{moment}}$, is:\n$$T_{\\text{moment}} = m_1 = - \\left( -\\frac{\\alpha^2}{2} \\right) = \\frac{\\alpha^2}{2}$$\nSubstituting back $\\alpha = \\ell\\sqrt{rc}$:\n$$T_{\\text{moment}} = \\frac{(\\ell\\sqrt{rc})^2}{2} = \\frac{rc\\ell^2}{2}$$\n\n**3.
