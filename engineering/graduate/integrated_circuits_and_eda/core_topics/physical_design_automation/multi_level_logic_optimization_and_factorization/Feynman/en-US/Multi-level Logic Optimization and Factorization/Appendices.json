            "problem": "In the context of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) for integrated circuits, consider the multi-level logic optimization of a Boolean network node whose Boolean function is given in algebraic (sum-of-products) form as $$f(a,b,c,d)=ab+ac+db+dc,$$ where juxtaposition denotes logical AND and $+$ denotes logical OR over Boolean variables $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. Starting only from the axioms and well-tested rules of Boolean algebra (commutativity, associativity, distributivity, idempotency, and absorption), perform algebraic factorization of $f$ to obtain a structured multi-level representation that reduces literal redundancy through common subexpression extraction. Then, establish functional equivalence of the original and factored forms by a truth-table equivalence argument grounded in Boolean semantics, without resorting to any heuristic or shortcut identities not derivable from the axioms. Provide the fully factored Boolean expression as your final answer. The final answer must be a single closed-form analytic expression in Boolean algebra notation and must not include an equality.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- The Boolean function to be optimized is $f(a,b,c,d) = ab+ac+db+dc$.\n- Logical operators are defined as juxtaposition for logical AND and the symbol $+$ for logical OR.\n- The input variables are $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, which are Boolean variables.\n- The allowed operations for transformation are the axioms and well-tested rules of Boolean algebra, specifically citing commutativity, associativity, distributivity, idempotency, and absorption.\n- The primary task is to perform algebraic factorization to achieve a multi-level representation that reduces literal redundancy.\n- A secondary task is to formally establish the functional equivalence of the original and factored forms using a truth-table argument.\n- The final answer must be the fully factored Boolean expression itself, not an equality.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is set within the formal mathematical system of Boolean algebra, which is the theoretical foundation for digital logic synthesis and electronic design automation. The problem is scientifically and mathematically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a specific Boolean function and a clear objective: to find an algebraically factored equivalent form. Such a factorization exists and can be derived uniquely through the standard application of the distributive property.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, unambiguous language, using standard terminology from digital logic and mathematics. There is no subjective content.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, with a clear and solvable task based on fundamental principles of Boolean algebra. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution consists of two parts as required: first, the algebraic factorization of the function $f$, and second, the proof of functional equivalence using a truth table.\n\n**Part 1: Algebraic Factorization**\n\nWe begin with the provided sum-of-products expression for the function $f$:\n$$ f(a,b,c,d) = ab+ac+db+dc $$\nThis two-level logic representation has four product terms, and the total literal count is $2+2+2+2 = 8$. The objective of multi-level logic optimization is to restructure this expression to reduce the literal count, which generally corresponds to a smaller and faster circuit implementation. We apply the axioms of Boolean algebra.\n\n1.  We can group the terms. Let us group the first two terms and the last two terms:\n    $$ f(a,b,c,d) = (ab+ac) + (db+dc) $$\n    This grouping is justified by the associative property of the OR operator.\n\n2.  We apply the distributive law, which states $xy+xz = x(y+z)$, to the first group $(ab+ac)$. Here, $a$ is the common factor.\n    $$ ab+ac = a(b+c) $$\n\n3.  Similarly, we apply the distributive law to the second group $(db+dc)$. Here, $d$ is the common factor. By applying the commutative law first to write it as $bd+cd$, the common factor $d$ is more apparent, but it is not strictly necessary.\n    $$ db+dc = d(b+c) $$\n\n4.  Substituting these factored sub-expressions back into the expression for $f$:\n    $$ f(a,b,c,d) = a(b+c) + d(b+c) $$\n\n5.  We observe that the term $(b+c)$ is now a common factor in the resulting expression. Let us define a temporary variable $X = (b+c)$. The expression becomes:\n    $$ f = aX + dX $$\n\n6.  Applying the distributive law once more to this expression:\n    $$ aX+dX = (a+d)X $$\n\n7.  Finally, we substitute the expression for $X$ back:\n    $$ f(a,b,c,d) = (a+d)(b+c) $$\nThis is the fully factored, multi-level form of the original function. This expression has a literal count of $1+1+1+1=4$, which is a reduction of $50\\%$ from the original $8$ literals. This demonstrates the successful reduction of literal redundancy.\n\n**Part 2: Functional Equivalence Proof via Truth Table**\n\nTo rigorously prove that the original expression, $f_{\\text{orig}} = ab+ac+db+dc$, is functionally equivalent to the factored expression, $f_{\\text{fact}} = (a+d)(b+c)$, we construct a truth table for all $2^4 = 16$ possible combinations of the input variables $a, b, c, d$. We will compute the value of both expressions for each input combination. Equivalence is established if and only if the output columns for $f_{\\text{orig}}$ and $f_{\\text{fact}}$ are identical. Boolean values are represented by $0$ (false) and $1$ (true).\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{|cccc||cccc|c||cc|c|}\n\\hline\na & b & c & d & ab & ac & db & dc & f_{\\text{orig}} & a+d & b+c & f_{\\text{fact}} \\\\\n\\hline\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nAs demonstrated by the truth table, the output column for $f_{\\text{orig}}$ is identical to the output column for $f_{\\text{fact}}$ for every possible input combination. This provides a complete and formal proof, grounded in Boolean semantics, that the two expressions are functionally equivalent. Thus, the algebraic factorization is correct.\nThe final factored expression is $(a+d)(b+c)$.",

Use the algebraic (not Boolean) factoring model, where a cube is a product of literals (no complementation), a function is cube-free if it cannot be algebraically divided by any cube of size at least $2$, and a kernel of a function is a cube-free quotient obtained by recursively dividing the function by cubes (products of literals) that divide at least two cubes of the function; the corresponding divisor cube is called a co-kernel.

It provides a clear function, a standard set of definitions from the field of logic synthesis (even if with minor terminological variations), and unambiguous optimization criteria (depth minimization, literal count constraint). The problem is self-contained and does not violate any scientific or mathematical principles. It is a standard exercise in multi-level logic optimization.\n\n**Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe initial expression is a sum-of-products (SOP):\n$$f(a,b,c,d,e) = ab + ac + bd + cd + e$$\nWe first analyze the cost of this SOP implementation in terms of literal count and logic depth.\n\n**Initial Literal Count:**\nThe literal count is the total number of literal occurrences at the primary inputs of the gates.\nThe terms $ab, ac, bd, cd$ require one $2$-input AND gate each.\n- `AND(a, b)`: $2$ literals\n- `AND(a, c)`: $2$ literals\n- `AND(b, d)`: $2$ literals\n- `AND(c, d)`: $2$ literals\nThe sum consists of $5$ terms ($ab, ac, bd, cd, e$), which requires four $2$-input OR gates. The literal $e$ is a direct input to one of these OR gates.\nTotal literal count = $2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9$.\n\n**Initial Logic Depth:**\nThe depth is the maximum number of gates on a path from any primary input to the output.\n- Level 1: Four parallel $2$-input AND gates for $ab, ac, bd, cd$.\n- Level 2-4: The outputs of the AND gates and the literal $e$ are summed using a tree of $2$-input OR gates. A $5$-input OR tree has a depth of $3$. For example: $\\text{OR}(\\text{OR}(\\text{OR}(ab, ac), \\text{OR}(bd, cd)), e)$.\nThe total depth is the depth of the AND stage plus the depth of the OR tree.\nTotal depth = $1 (\\text{AND}) + 3 (\\text{OR}) = 4$.\n\nNext, we identify common subexpressions by finding the kernels of $f$, as per the problem's instructions. A kernel is a cube-free quotient. We must divide $f$ by literals that appear in at least two cubes.\n\nThe literals appearing in two or more cubes are:\n- $a$: in $ab$ and $ac$.\n- $b$: in $ab$ and $bd$.\n- $c$: in $ac$ and $cd$.\n- $d$: in $bd$ and $cd$.\n\nWe perform algebraic division for each of these literals as co-kernels.\n\n1.  **Division by $a$**:\n    The quotient $f/a$ is formed from cubes divisible by $a$: $ab, ac$.\n    $$Q_a = \\frac{f}{a} = \\frac{ab}{a} + \\frac{ac}{a} = b+c$$\n    The quotient $Q_a = b+c$ contains no common literal factors, so it is cube-free. Therefore, $b+c$ is a kernel of $f$.\n\n2.  **Division by $b$**:\n    The quotient $f/b$ is formed from cubes divisible by $b$: $ab, bd$.\n    $$Q_b = \\frac{f}{b} = \\frac{ab}{b} + \\frac{bd}{b} = a+d$$\n    The quotient $Q_b = a+d$ is cube-free. Therefore, $a+d$ is a kernel of $f$.\n\n3.  **Division by $c$**:\n    The quotient $f/c$ is formed from cubes divisible by $c$: $ac, cd$.\n    $$Q_c = \\frac{f}{c} = \\frac{ac}{c} + \\frac{cd}{c} = a+d$$\n    This gives the same kernel, $a+d$.\n\n4.  **Division by $d$**:\n    The quotient $f/d$ is formed from cubes divisible by $d$: $bd, cd$.\n    $$Q_d = \\frac{f}{d} = \\frac{bd}{d} + \\frac{cd}{d} = b+c$$\n    This gives the same kernel, $b+c$.\n\nThe set of distinct, non-trivial kernels obtained is $\\{b+c, a+d\\}$. We can now use these kernels to find an efficient factorization.\n\nLet's use the kernel $k_1 = b+c$. We can rewrite $f$ by factoring out common terms:\n$$f = ab + ac + bd + cd + e = a(b+c) + d(b+c) + e$$\nThis expression reveals a common factor of $(b+c)$. We can factor it out algebraically:\n$$f = (a+d)(b+c) + e$$\nThis factorization is based on both kernels we found, since $a+d$ is the other kernel.\n\nLet's analyze the cost of this new factorized expression: $f = (a+d)(b+c) + e$.\nThis can be implemented with intermediate variables:\n- $k_1 = a+d$\n- $k_2 = b+c$\n- $p = k_1 \\cdot k_2$\n- $f = p + e$\n\n**Literal Count of Factored Form:**\nThe primary inputs are consumed by the first level of gates.\n- Gate for $k_1 = a+d$: An OR gate with inputs $a, d$. Literal count = $2$.\n- Gate for $k_2 = b+c$: An OR gate with inputs $b, c$. Literal count = $2$.\n- Gate for $f = p+e$: An OR gate with one input being the literal $e$. Literal count = $1$.\nTotal literal count = $2 + 2 + 1 = 5$.\nComparing to the original count of $9$, this is a reduction. The condition is satisfied.\n\n**Logic Depth of Factored Form:**\n- Level 1: `OR(a, d)` and `OR(b, c)` can be computed in parallel.\n- Level 2: The outputs of Level 1 are inputs to an AND gate: `AND(OR(a, d), OR(b, c))`.\n- Level 3: The output of Level 2 is an input to an OR gate with $e$: `OR(AND(...), e)`.\nThe longest path from a primary input (e.g., $a$) to the output is $a \\rightarrow \\text{OR}(a,d) \\rightarrow \\text{AND}(...) \\rightarrow \\text{OR}(...,e)$. This path traverses $3$ gates.\nThe total depth is $3$.\nComparing to the original depth of $4$, this is a reduction.\n\nThe factorization $f = (a+d)(b+c) + e$ minimizes depth (from $4$ to $3$) and reduces the literal count (from $9$ to $5$). This meets all the problem's criteria. The resulting algebraic expression represents the optimized multi-level logic structure.",

A function $f$ is positive unate in a variable $x$ if its negative cofactor with respect to $x$, denoted $f_{\\overline{x}}$, is contained in its positive cofactor, $f_x$. That is, $f_{\\overline{x}} \\subseteq f_x$. In Boolean algebra, this is equivalent to $f_{\\overline{x}} \\cdot \\overline{f_x} = 0$ or $f_x + f_{\\overline{x}} = f_x$.

This fails, for example, if $b=1$, $c=0$, and $d=0$.\n    Since neither cofactor contains the other, the function $f$ is **binate** in $a$. This is expected, as both $a$ and $\\overline{a}$ appear in the sum-of-products expression.\n\n2.  **Unateness with respect to variable $b$:**\n    The positive cofactor is $f_b = f(a,1,c,d) = a(1) + \\overline{a}c + (1)d = a + \\overline{a}c + d$.\n    The negative cofactor is $f_{\\overline{b}} = f(a,0,c,d) = a(0) + \\overline{a}c + (0)d = \\overline{a}c$.\n    To check for positive unateness, we test if $f_{\\overline{b}} \\subseteq f_b$. Is $\\overline{a}c \\subseteq a + \\overline{a}c + d$? Yes, this is true because $\\overline{a}c$ is one of the terms in the disjunction.\n    Therefore, the function $f$ is **positive unate** in $b$.\n\n3.  **Unateness with respect to variable $c$:**\n    The positive cofactor is $f_c = f(a,b,1,d) = ab + \\overline{a}(1) + bd = ab + \\overline{a} + bd$.

Yes, this is true because $ab + \\overline{a}c$ is a sub-expression of the larger disjunction.\n    Therefore, the function $f$ is **positive unate** in $d$.\n\nNext, we perform the algebraic factorization. The initial expression is $f = ab + \\overline{a}c + bd$. The literal count is the sum of literals in each product term: $2 + 2 + 2 = 6$. The goal is to find a factored form with fewer than $6$ literals, with the constraint that any extracted multi-cube factor contains only positive (uncomplemented) literals.\n\nAlgebraic factorization relies on the distributive law, $XY+XZ = X(Y+Z)$. We look for common factors among the product terms of $f$.\nThe terms are $ab$, $\\overline{a}c$, and $bd$.\nThe variable $b$ is common to the first term, $ab$, and the third term, $bd$. No other variable is common to any pair of terms. We can use the distributive law to factor out $b$:\n$$ ab + bd = b(a+d) $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $f$:\n$$ f = (ab + bd) + \\overline{a}c = b(a+d) + \\overline{a}c $$\nLet's analyze this new expression.\nThe extracted factor is $(a+d)$. This is a multi-cube factor (a sum of cubes, where here the cubes are single literals). The literals within this factor are $a$ and $d$. Both are positive (uncomplemented), so this factorization satisfies the given constraint.\n\nNow, we calculate the literal count for the factored expression $f = b(a+d) + \\overline{a}c$.\nThe literals are $b$, $a$, $d$, $\\overline{a}$, and $c$. The total count is $1 + (1+1) + 2 = 5$ literals.\nThis is a reduction from the original count of $6$ literals.\nThe process of finding such factors can be formalized by finding the kernels of the expression. For $f=ab+\\overline{a}c+bd$, the only non-trivial kernel is $(a+d)$, found by dividing $f$ by the cube $b$. Extracting this kernel leads to the factorization derived above. Further factorization of the quotient $b$, remainder $\\overline{a}c$, or the kernel $(a+d)$ is not possible.\n\nThus, the derived expression $b(a+d) + \\overline{a}c$ is the correct multi-level algebraic factorization that reduces the literal count and adheres to the specified constraint.",
