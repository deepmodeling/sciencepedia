We apply the chain rule, as $f$ is a function of $V_{th}$, which in turn is a function of $V_{SB}$.\n$$\\frac{df}{dV_{SB}} = \\frac{df}{dV_{th}} \\cdot \\frac{dV_{th}}{dV_{SB}} = 0$$\nThe derivative of the threshold voltage with respect to $V_{SB}$ is:\n$$\\frac{dV_{th}}{dV_{SB}} = \\frac{d}{dV_{SB}}\\left[V_{th0} + \\gamma\\left(\\sqrt{2\\phi_{F} + V_{SB}} - \\sqrt{2\\phi_{F}}\\right)\\right] = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\sqrt{2\\phi_{F} + V_{SB}}}$$\nFor a reverse bias ($V_{SB} \\ge 0$), this term is positive and non-zero (assuming $V_{SB}$ is not infinite).

By symmetry, we can analyze the voltage profile along a line from a tap (at position $x=0$, potential $V(0)=0$) to the midpoint between it and an adjacent tap (at position $x=p/2$). The lateral current $I(x)$ flowing towards the tap at a given position $x$ is the integral of all the current density $J_{\\mathrm{b}}$ collected from the area further away. In a 1D strip model of effective width $p$, the total lateral current $I(x)$ is:\n$$ I(x) = \\int_{x}^{p/2} (J_{\\mathrm{b}} \\cdot p) \\, dx' = J_{\\mathrm{b}}p\\left(\\frac{p}{2} - x\\right) $$\nAccording to Ohm's law for a resistive sheet with sheet resistance $R_{\\mathrm{s}}$, the differential voltage drop $dV$ across a segment of length $dx$ and width $p$ is:\n$$ dV = I(x) dR = \\left[J_{\\mathrm{b}}p\\left(\\frac{p}{2} - x\\right)\\right] \\left(R_{\\mathrm{s}} \\frac{dx}{p}\\right) = J_{\\mathrm{b}}R_{\\mathrm{s}}\\left(\\frac{p}{2} - x\\right) dx $$\nIntegrating this from the tap at $x=0$ to the midpoint at $x=p/2$ gives the maximum voltage drop, $V_{SB}$:\n$$ V_{SB} = \\int_{0}^{p/2} J_{\\mathrm{b}}R_{\\mathrm{s}}\\left(\\frac{p}{2} - x\\right) dx = J_{\\mathrm{b}}R_{\\mathrm{s}} \\left[ \\frac{p}{2}x - \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right]_{0}^{p/2} = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{b}}R_{\\mathrm{s}}p^2}{8} $$\nThis is the governing relation. The tap-cell density, $\\rho_{tap}$, is the inverse of the area per tap, $p^2$. We can solve for it using the maximum allowed voltage drop, $V_{SB,max}$:\n$$ \\rho_{tap} = \\frac{1}{p^2} = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{b}}R_{\\mathrm{s}}}{8V_{SB,max}} $$\nSubstituting the given numerical values in SI units ($J_{\\mathrm{b}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{m}^{2}$, $R_{\\mathrm{s}} = 1.5 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\Omega$, $V_{SB,max} = 0.01\\ \\mathrm{V}$):\n$$ \\rho_{tap} = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{m}^{2})(1.5 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\Omega)}{8(0.01\\ \\mathrm{V})} = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{7}}{0.08}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2} = 1.875 \\times 10^{8}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2} $$\nThe problem asks for the density in units of $\\mathrm{mm}^{-2}$. Converting units ($1\\ \\mathrm{m}^2 = 10^6\\ \\mathrm{mm}^2$):\n$$ \\rho_{tap} = (1.875 \\times 10^{8}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2}) \\times (10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{mm}^2) = 187.5\\ \\mathrm{mm}^{-2} $$\nAs a verification, the resulting tap pitch is $p = 1/\\sqrt{\\rho_{tap}} \\approx 0.073\\ \\mathrm{mm}$. This is much smaller than the block size $L = 5\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, so the interior approximation is justified.\n\nRounding the result to three significant figures gives $188\\ \\mathrm{mm}^{-2}$.",
