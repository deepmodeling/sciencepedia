The scenario described is a standard and critical aspect of modern integrated circuit (IC) design, known as IR drop analysis for body biasing. The parameters provided are physically realistic for contemporary CMOS processes.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary information and a clear objective. The \"conservative one-dimensional simplification\" is an explicit instruction that makes the problem analytically tractable and removes ambiguity. The goal is to find a minimum density, which corresponds to a maximum pitch, subject to a clear constraint.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, technical language with no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\n**Verdict:**\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Governing Relation and Solution\n\nWe are asked to model the voltage drop using a one-dimensional simplification. Consider two adjacent taps on the square grid, located at coordinates $x=0$ and $x=p$. The midpoint is at $x=p/2$. We analyze the voltage profile $V(x)$ from the tap at $x=0$ to this midpoint. By symmetry, no current flows across the plane at $x=p/2$, so the electric field component in the $x$-direction is zero at this point. We set the potential at the tap to be $V(0) = 0$. The maximum voltage drop will occur at the midpoint, so $V_{SB} = V(p/2)$.\n\nThe simplification models the conduction as one-dimensional. This can be conceptualized as analyzing a strip of the resistive well material. For a square tap grid of pitch $p$, it is reasonable to assume this strip has a width of $p$. The analysis is for the segment from $x=0$ to $x=p/2$.\n\nThe current density injected into the well is $J_{\\mathrm{b}}$ (in $\\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{m}^2$). For our $1$D strip model of width $p$, the current injected per unit length is $J_{\\mathrm{b}} \\times p$.\n\nThe total lateral current, $I(x)$, flowing past a point $x$ towards the tap at $x=0$ is the integral of all the current injected in the region from $x$ to the point of symmetry, $p/2$.\n$$ I(x) = \\int_{x}^{p/2} (J_{\\mathrm{b}} \\cdot p) \\, dx' = J_{\\mathrm{b}}p [x']_{x}^{p/2} = J_{\\mathrm{b}}p\\left(\\frac{p}{2} - x\\right) $$\n\nAccording to Ohm's law for a resistive sheet, the resistance $dR$ of a differential segment of length $dx$ and width $p$ is given by:\n$$ dR = R_{\\mathrm{s}} \\frac{dx}{p} $$\nwhere $R_{\\mathrm{s}}$ is the sheet resistance.\n\nThe differential voltage drop $dV$ across this segment is:\n$$ dV = I(x) dR = \\left[J_{\\mathrm{b}}p\\left(\\frac{p}{2} - x\\right)\\right] \\left[R_{\\mathrm{s}} \\frac{dx}{p}\\right] = J_{\\mathrm{b}}R_{\\mathrm{s}}\\left(\\frac{p}{2} - x\\right) dx $$\n\nTo find the total voltage drop $V_{SB}$ from the tap at $x=0$ to the midpoint at $x=p/2$, we integrate $dV$ from $0$ to $p/2$:\n$$ V_{SB} = V(p/2) - V(0) = \\int_{0}^{p/2} J_{\\mathrm{b}}R_{\\mathrm{s}}\\left(\\frac{p}{2} - x\\right) dx $$\n$$ V_{SB} = J_{\\mathrm{b}}R_{\\mathrm{s}} \\left[ \\frac{p}{2}x - \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right]_{0}^{p/2} $$\n$$ V_{SB} = J_{\\mathrm{b}}R_{\\mathrm{s}} \\left( \\frac{p}{2}\\frac{p}{2} - \\frac{(p/2)^2}{2} - 0 \\right) = J_{\\mathrm{b}}R_{\\mathrm{s}} \\left( \\frac{p^2}{4} - \\frac{p^2}{8} \\right) $$\nThis gives the governing relation for the maximum voltage drop under the specified 1D model:\n$$ V_{SB} = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{b}}R_{\\mathrm{s}}p^2}{8} $$\n\nWe are given a maximum permissible voltage drop $V_{SB,max} = 10\\ \\mathrm{mV}$. This corresponds to a maximum tap pitch $p$. We can solve for $p^2$:\n$$ p^2 = \\frac{8V_{SB,max}}{J_{\\mathrm{b}}R_{\\mathrm{s}}} $$\n\nThe tap-cell density, $\\rho_{tap}$, is the number of taps per unit area. For a square grid with pitch $p$, the area per tap is $p^2$. Therefore, the density is:\n$$ \\rho_{tap} = \\frac{1}{p^2} = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{b}}R_{\\mathrm{s}}}{8V_{SB,max}} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values, ensuring consistent SI units.\n- $J_{\\mathrm{b}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{m}^{2}$\n- $R_{\\mathrm{s}} = 1.5 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\Omega$\n- $V_{SB,max} = 10\\ \\mathrm{mV} = 10 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{V} = 0.01\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n\n$$ \\rho_{tap} = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{m}^{2})(1.5 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\Omega)}{8(0.01\\ \\mathrm{V})} = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{7}}{8 \\times 10^{-2}}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2} $$\n$$ \\rho_{tap} = 0.1875 \\times 10^{9}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2} = 1.875 \\times 10^{8}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the density in units of $\\mathrm{mm}^{-2}$. We use the conversion $1\\ \\mathrm{m}^2 = (10^3\\ \\mathrm{mm})^2 = 10^6\\ \\mathrm{mm}^2$.\n$$ \\rho_{tap} (\\text{in mm}^{-2}) = \\frac{1.875 \\times 10^{8}}{10^{6}} = 187.5\\ \\mathrm{mm}^{-2} $$\n\n### Step 3: Verification of the Underlying Approximation\n\nWe must verify that the resulting pitch $p$ is much smaller than the block size $L = 5\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, which justifies neglecting boundary effects of the block.\nFirst, we find $p$ from the density $\\rho_{tap}$:\n$$ p = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\rho_{tap}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1.875 \\times 10^{8}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2}}} \\approx 7.302967 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\nConverting $p$ to millimeters:\n$$ p \\approx 7.303 \\times 10^{-5} \\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{mm} = 0.07303\\ \\mathrm{mm} $$\nNow, we compare $p$ with $L = 5\\ \\mathrm{mm}$:\n$$ \\frac{p}{L} = \\frac{0.07303\\ \\mathrm{mm}}{5\\ \\mathrm{mm}} \\approx 0.0146 $$\nSince $p$ is less than $2\\%$ of $L$, the condition $p \\ll L$ is satisfied. This validates the use of an infinite-grid approximation for the interior of the $L \\times L$ block.\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer Formulation\n\nThe required tap-cell density is $187.5\\ \\mathrm{mm}^{-2}$. We are asked to round this to three significant figures. Standard rounding of the digit $5$ yields $188$.\nFinal answer: $188\\ \\mathrm{mm}^{-2}$.",
