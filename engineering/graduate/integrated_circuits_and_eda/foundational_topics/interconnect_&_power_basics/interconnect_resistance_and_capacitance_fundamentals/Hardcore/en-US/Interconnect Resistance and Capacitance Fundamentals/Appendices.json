            "solution": "The problem is addressed in two parts as requested: first, the derivation and calculation of the interconnect's direct-current (DC) resistance, and second, the derivation and calculation of the maximum frequency for the lumped-element approximation.\n\n**Part 1: Interconnect Resistance**\n\nThe derivation for the resistance $R$ of a uniform conductor begins with the microscopic form of Ohm's law, which relates the current density vector $\\mathbf{J}$ to the electric field vector $\\mathbf{E}$ and the material's conductivity $\\sigma$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J} = \\sigma \\mathbf{E}\n$$\nThe conductivity $\\sigma$ is the reciprocal of the resistivity $\\rho$, so $\\sigma = 1/\\rho$.\n\nConsider a uniform wire of length $L$ and constant cross-sectional area $A$. When a DC potential difference $V$ is applied across its ends, a uniform electric field is established within the conductor, directed along its length. The magnitude of this field is given by the relationship between potential and field for a uniform case:\n$$\nE = \\frac{V}{L}\n$$\nThis uniform electric field drives a uniform current density, also directed along the length of the wire, with magnitude:\n$$\nJ = \\sigma E = \\frac{\\sigma V}{L}\n$$\nThe total current $I$ flowing through the wire is the integral of the current density over the cross-sectional area $A$. Since $\\mathbf{J}$ is uniform and perpendicular to the cross-section, the integral simplifies to a product:\n$$\nI = \\iint_{A} \\mathbf{J} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A} = J A\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $J$ gives:\n$$\nI = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma V}{L}\\right) A = \\frac{\\sigma A}{L}V\n$$\nThe macroscopic definition of resistance is given by Ohm's law, $R = V/I$. Rearranging the previous equation to solve for $V/I$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{V}{I} = \\frac{L}{\\sigma A}\n$$\nFinally, substituting $\\sigma = 1/\\rho$, we arrive at the standard expression for the resistance of a uniform conductor:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\rho L}{A}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation. Now, we compute the resistance of the specified interconnect.

The permittivity is given by $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_r \\epsilon_0$, where $\\epsilon_r$ is the relative permittivity and $\\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space. The expression for wave speed becomes:\n$$\nv = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\epsilon_r \\epsilon_0}}\n$$\nRecognizing that the speed of light in vacuum is $c = 1/\\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0}$, we can simplify the expression for $v$:\n$$\nv = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\epsilon_r} \\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0}} = \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{\\epsilon_r}}\n$$\nThe relationship between wavelength $\\lambda$, frequency $f$, and wave speed $v$ is $\\lambda = v/f$. Substituting the expression for $v$:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{c}{f\\sqrt{\\epsilon_r}}\n$$\nThe lumped-element approximation is valid when the physical length of the component is much smaller than the wavelength of the signal propagating through it. This ensures that a negligible phase shift occurs along the component's length, allowing it to be treated as a single point in a circuit diagram. The problem provides the engineering criterion for this approximation as $L \\le \\lambda/10$.\n\nTo find the maximum frequency, $f_{\\max}$, for which this criterion holds, we consider the boundary condition:\n$$\nL = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\min}}{10}\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda_{\\min}$ is the minimum wavelength that satisfies the condition, corresponding to the maximum frequency $f_{\\max}$. Substituting the expression for wavelength:\n$$\nL = \\frac{1}{10} \\left( \\frac{c}{f_{\\max}\\sqrt{\\epsilon_r}} \\right)\n$$\nSolving for $f_{\\max}$ yields the desired criterion:\n$$\nf_{\\max} = \\frac{c}{10 L \\sqrt{\\epsilon_r}}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation. Now, we compute $f_{\\max}$ using the given parameters:\n$L = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\text{m}$.\n$\\epsilon_r = 3.9$.\n$c = 3.00 \\times 10^{8} \\,\\text{m/s}$.\n\nSubstituting these values:\n$$\nf_{\\max} = \\frac{3.00 \\times 10^{8} \\,\\text{m/s}}{10 \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\text{m}) \\times \\sqrt{3.9}} = \\frac{3.00 \\times 10^{8}}{0.05 \\times \\sqrt{3.9}} \\,\\text{Hz}\n$$\n$$\nf_{\\max} \\approx \\frac{3.00 \\times 10^{8}}{0.05 \\times 1.9748} \\,\\text{Hz} \\approx \\frac{3.00 \\times 10^{8}}{0.09874} \\,\\text{Hz} \\approx 3.038... \\times 10^{9} \\,\\text{Hz}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the maximum frequency is $3.04 \\times 10^9 \\,\\text{Hz}$.",

            "solution": "The solution proceeds in two parts: first, the calculation of the relative error, and second, the physical explanation for the discrepancy between the parallel-plate model and the field solver result.\n\nFirst, we compute the capacitance based on the parallel-plate approximation, denoted as $C_{\\mathrm{pp}}$. The formula for a parallel-plate capacitor is:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{pp}} = \\frac{\\varepsilon A}{d_{\\text{sep}}}$$\nwhere $\\varepsilon$ is the permittivity of the dielectric material, $A$ is the area of the plates, and $d_{\\text{sep}}$ is the separation distance between the plates.\n\nFor the given interconnect, the dielectric is silicon dioxide with a relative permittivity $\\varepsilon_r = 3.9$. The absolute permittivity is $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0$. The problem assumes the capacitance is formed between the bottom surface of the interconnect and the ground plane. Therefore, the area $A$ is the product of the interconnect's width $w$ and length $L$, so $A = w L$. The separation distance is the dielectric thickness $d$.\n\nSubstituting these into the formula, we have:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{pp}} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0 w L}{d}$$\n\nThe given values must be converted to base SI units (meters).\nThe width is $w = 0.10~\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 0.10 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{m}$.\nThe length is $L = 1.00~\\mathrm{mm} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{m}$.\nThe dielectric thickness is $d = 0.20~\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 0.20 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{m}$.\nThe constants are $\\varepsilon_r = 3.9$ and $\\varepsilon_0 = 8.854 \\times 10^{-12}~\\mathrm{F/m}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $C_{\\mathrm{pp}}$:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{pp}} = \\frac{(3.9)(8.854 \\times 10^{-12}~\\mathrm{F/m})(0.10 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{m})(1.00 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{m})}{0.20 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{m}}$$\n$$C_{\\mathrm{pp}} = \\frac{3.9 \\times 8.854 \\times 0.10 \\times 1.00}{0.20} \\times \\frac{10^{-12} \\times 10^{-6} \\times 10^{-3}}{10^{-6}}~\\mathrm{F}$$\n$$C_{\\mathrm{pp}} = 17.2653 \\times 10^{-15}~\\mathrm{F} = 1.72653 \\times 10^{-14}~\\mathrm{F}$$\n\nNext, we compute the relative error $\\delta$ using the given formula and the high-fidelity field solver capacitance $C_{\\mathrm{fs}} = 2.87 \\times 10^{-14}~\\mathrm{F}$.\n$$\\delta = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{pp}} - C_{\\mathrm{fs}}}{C_{\\mathrm{fs}}}$$\n$$\\delta = \\frac{1.72653 \\times 10^{-14}~\\mathrm{F} - 2.87 \\times 10^{-14}~\\mathrm{F}}{2.87 \\times 10^{-14}~\\mathrm{F}}$$\n$$\\delta = \\frac{1.72653 - 2.87}{2.87} = \\frac{-1.14347}{2.87} \\approx -0.3984216$$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\\delta \\approx -0.3984$$\n\nThe physical discrepancy between the parallel-plate capacitance $C_{\\mathrm{pp}}$ and the field solver capacitance $C_{\\mathrm{fs}}$ arises because the parallel-plate model is an oversimplification. It only accounts for the electric field lines originating from the bottom surface of the conductor and terminating perpendicularly on the ground plane, assuming a perfectly uniform field. In reality, the electric field is more complex. The total capacitance $C_{\\mathrm{fs}}$ includes additional contributions, collectively known as fringing capacitance ($C_{\\text{fringe}}$), such that $C_{\\mathrm{total}} = C_{\\mathrm{pp}} + C_{\\text{fringe}}$.\n\nThe sources of this fringing capacitance are:\n$1$. **Edge Fringing:** The electric field lines at the edges of the conductor's bottom face do not travel straight down but \"fringe\" outwards into the dielectric. This outward bowing effectively increases the area over which the field interacts with the ground plane, thus increasing the capacitance beyond the simple $w \\times L$ area consideration.\n$2$. **Sidewall Capacitance:** The parallel-plate model completely ignores the interconnect's thickness $t = 0.05~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. The vertical sidewalls of the conductor (with area $t \\times L$ on each side) also hold charge and have electric field lines that terminate on the ground plane. This sidewall-to-ground capacitance is a significant contributor to the total capacitance, especially for narrow interconnects.\n$3$. **Corner/Top-Surface Effects:** Field lines can also originate from the top corners and, to a lesser extent, the top surface of the conductor, wrapping around to terminate on the ground plane.\n\nThe term \"narrow-width interconnect\" is key. The validity of the parallel-plate approximation rests on the assumption that the width $w$ is much larger than the separation $d$ (i.e., $w/d \\gg 1$) and the thickness $t$ (i.e., $w/t \\gg 1$). In this problem, the aspect ratio of width to separation is $w/d = (0.10~\\mu\\mathrm{m}) / (0.20~\\mu\\mathrm{m}) = 0.5$, and the ratio of width to thickness is $w/t = (0.10~\\mu\\mathrm{m}) / (0.05~\\mu\\mathrm{m}) = 2$. Since $w$ is not significantly larger than $d$ or $t$, the fringing and sidewall capacitance components are not negligible; in fact, they are substantial.\n\nThe calculated error $\\delta \\approx -0.3984$ indicates that the parallel-plate value $C_{\\mathrm{pp}}$ is approximately $40\\%$ lower than the more accurate field solver value $C_{\\mathrm{fs}}$. This large negative error quantitatively confirms that the parallel-plate model severely underestimates the total capacitance by neglecting the dominant fringing and sidewall effects present in this narrow-width geometry.",
