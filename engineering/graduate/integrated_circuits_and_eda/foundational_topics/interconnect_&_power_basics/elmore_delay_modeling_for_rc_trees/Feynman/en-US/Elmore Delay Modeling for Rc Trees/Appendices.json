The source connects through a series resistor $R_{0}$ to an internal node $0$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the Elmore delay to leaf node $a$ from first principles, followed by a numerical evaluation. The derivation must be based on Kirchhoff’s laws, conservation of charge, and the definition of the first time moment of the impulse response.\n\nFirst, let us define the Elmore delay. For a linear time-invariant (LTI) system, the delay at an output node $i$ can be characterized by the first moment of the impulse response at that node, $h_i(t)$. The Elmore delay, $\\tau_{Di}$, is defined as:\n$$ \\tau_{Di} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t h_i(t) dt $$\nwhere the impulse response is normalized such that its integral over all time is unity, $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} h_i(t) dt = 1$.\n\nThe problem describes a voltage step input of amplitude $V_{\\text{DD}}$. Let $v_i(t)$ be the voltage response at node $i$ to this step input, $v_{\\text{in}}(t) = V_{\\text{DD}} u(t)$, where $u(t)$ is the Heaviside step function. For an LTI system, the impulse response is the time derivative of the step response, scaled by the input step amplitude. For our circuit, which is an RC tree, the final steady-state voltage at any node $i$ is $V_{\\text{DD}}$. Therefore, the normalized impulse response is $h_i(t) = \\frac{1}{V_{\\text{DD}}} \\frac{d v_i(t)}{dt}$.\n\nSubstituting this into the definition of Elmore delay for node $a$:\n$$ \\tau_{Da} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t \\left( \\frac{1}{V_{\\text{DD}}} \\frac{d v_a(t)}{dt} \\right) dt = \\frac{1}{V_{\\text{DD}}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t \\frac{d v_a(t)}{dt} dt $$\nWe can evaluate the integral using integration by parts, $\\int u \\, dv = uv - \\int v \\, du$. Let $u=t$ and $dv = \\frac{d v_a(t)}{dt} dt$. Then $du=dt$ and $v=v_a(t)$.\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t \\frac{d v_a(t)}{dt} dt = \\left[ t v_a(t) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} - \\int_{0}^{\\infty} v_a(t) dt $$\nThe boundary term $\\left[ t v_a(t) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty}$ needs careful evaluation. At $t=0$, the term is $0$. As $t \\rightarrow \\infty$, $v_a(t)$ approaches its steady-state value $V_{\\text{DD}}$. The transient response of a stable RC circuit decays exponentially, so we can write $v_a(t) = V_{\\text{DD}} - f(t)$, where $f(t)$ contains terms like $e^{-t/\\tau_{\\text{pole}}}$ that approach zero faster than $1/t$. Therefore, $\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} t(V_{\\text{DD}} - v_a(t)) = 0$.\nThe integral identity can be established as:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (V_{\\text{DD}} - v_a(t)) dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t \\frac{d v_a(t)}{dt} dt $$\nThis formulation connects the first moment of the impulse response to the area over the step response transient. The Elmore delay can thus be expressed as:\n$$ \\tau_{Da} = \\frac{1}{V_{\\text{DD}}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (V_{\\text{DD}} - v_a(t)) dt $$\nNow, we apply Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL). The voltage difference $V_{\\text{DD}} - v_a(t)$ is the total voltage drop along the unique resistive path from the input source to node $a$. The circuit topology is as follows: Source $\\rightarrow R_0 \\rightarrow$ node $0 \\rightarrow R_a \\rightarrow$ node $a$.\nLet $I_{R0}(t)$ be the current through $R_0$ (from source to node $0$) and $I_{Ra}(t)$ be the current through $R_a$ (from node $0$ to node $a$). The voltage drops are given by Ohm's law.\nFor $t>0$, $v_{\\text{in}}(t) = V_{\\text{DD}}$.\n$$ V_{\\text{DD}} - v_a(t) = (V_{\\text{DD}} - v_0(t)) + (v_0(t) - v_a(t)) = I_{R0}(t)R_0 + I_{Ra}(t)R_a $$\nSubstituting this into the integral expression for $\\tau_{Da}$:\n$$ \\tau_{Da} = \\frac{1}{V_{\\text{DD}}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left( I_{R0}(t)R_0 + I_{Ra}(t)R_a \\right) dt $$\n$$ \\tau_{Da} = \\frac{1}{V_{\\text{DD}}} \\left( R_0 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} I_{R0}(t) dt + R_a \\int_{0}^{\\infty} I_{Ra}(t) dt \\right) $$\nNext, we invoke the principle of conservation of charge. The integral of current over time, $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} I(t) dt$, represents the total charge, $Q$, that has flowed. This charge must be accumulated on the capacitors to change their voltage from the initial state ($0$) to the final state ($V_{\\text{DD}}$). The charge on a capacitor is $Q = CV$.\n\nThe current $I_{R0}(t)$ through the resistor $R_0$ supplies the charge required to charge all capacitors in the tree: $C_0$, $C_a$, and $C_b$. The total charge supplied is:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} I_{R0}(t) dt = Q_{\\text{total}} = C_0 \\Delta V_0 + C_a \\Delta V_a + C_b \\Delta V_b $$\nSince $\\Delta V_0 = \\Delta V_a = \\Delta V_b = V_{\\text{DD}} - 0 = V_{\\text{DD}}$, we have:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} I_{R0}(t) dt = (C_0 + C_a + C_b) V_{\\text{DD}} $$\nThe current $I_{Ra}(t)$ through the resistor $R_a$ supplies charge only to the capacitor at node $a$, as it is a leaf node.\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} I_{Ra}(t) dt = C_a \\Delta V_a = C_a V_{\\text{DD}} $$\nNow, we substitute these charge expressions back into the equation for $\\tau_{Da}$:\n$$ \\tau_{Da} = \\frac{1}{V_{\\text{DD}}} \\left[ R_0 (C_0 + C_a + C_b) V_{\\text{DD}} + R_a (C_a V_{\\text{DD}}) \\right] $$\nThe $V_{\\text{DD}}$ terms cancel, yielding the final expression for the Elmore delay at node $a$:\n$$ \\tau_{Da} = R_0 (C_0 + C_a + C_b) + R_a C_a $$\nThis completes the derivation from first principles.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the given parameter values:\n$R_{0}=50\\,\\Omega$\n$R_{a}=100\\,\\Omega$\n$C_{0}=5\\,\\text{fF} = 5 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\text{F}$\n$C_{a}=15\\,\\text{fF} = 15 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\text{F}$\n$C_{b}=25\\,\\text{fF} = 25 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\text{F}$\n\nSubstitute the values into the derived formula:\n$$ \\tau_{Da} = (50\\,\\Omega) (5 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\text{F} + 15 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\text{F} + 25 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\text{F}) + (100\\,\\Omega) (15 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\text{F}) $$\n$$ \\tau_{Da} = (50\\,\\Omega) (45 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\text{F}) + (100\\,\\Omega) (15 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\text{F}) $$\nThe product of Ohms and Farads gives seconds ($\\Omega \\cdot \\text{F} = \\frac{V}{I} \\cdot \\frac{Q}{V} = \\frac{Q}{I} = \\frac{I \\cdot t}{I} = t$).\n$$ \\tau_{Da} = (50 \\times 45 \\times 10^{-15})\\,\\text{s} + (100 \\times 15 \\times 10^{-15})\\,\\text{s} $$\n$$ \\tau_{Da} = (2250 \\times 10^{-15})\\,\\text{s} + (1500 \\times 10^{-15})\\,\\text{s} $$\n$$ \\tau_{Da} = 3750 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\text{s} $$\nThe problem asks for the answer in picoseconds ($1\\,\\text{ps} = 10^{-12}\\,\\text{s}$) and rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ \\tau_{Da} = 3750 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\text{s} = 3.750 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{s} = 3.75\\,\\text{ps} $$\nThe result $3.75$ already has three significant figures.",

The Elmore delay $\\tau_{Di}$ at a node $i$ is defined as the first moment of the impulse response $h_i(t)$ at that node:\n$$ \\tau_{Di} = \\int_0^\\infty t h_i(t) dt $$\nThis definition can be shown to be equivalent to the expression derived from circuit analysis. For an RC tree rooted at node $0$ and driven by a voltage source, the Elmore delay at any node $i$ is given by:\n$$ \\tau_{Di} = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} R_{ik} C_k $$\nwhere $N$ is the number of nodes in the tree, $C_k$ is the capacitance at node $k$, and $R_{ik}$ is the resistance of the path from the root that is common to both the path to node $i$ and the path to node $k$. We can express $R_{ik}$ as the sum of resistances of edges $e_j$ on the shared path:\n$$ R_{ik} = \\sum_{e_j \\in \\text{path}(0,i) \\cap \\text{path}(0,k)} R_j $$\nwhere $R_j$ is the resistance of edge $e_j$.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Linear-Time Algorithm**\n\nThe quadratic complexity of computing the sum over all pairs of nodes $(i, k)$ makes the above formula inefficient for large circuits. A more efficient, linear-time algorithm can be derived by restructuring the summation. By swapping the order of summation, we can group terms by resistance instead of capacitance:\n$$ \\tau_{Di} = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} C_k \\left( \\sum_{e_j \\in \\text{path}(0,i) \\cap \\text{path}(0,k)} R_j \\right) = \\sum_{e_j} R_j \\left( \\sum_{k \\text{ s.t. } e_j \\in \\text{path}(0,i) \\cap \\text{path}(0,k)} C_k \\right) $$\nLet an edge $e_j$ connect a parent node $u_j$ to a child node $v_j$. The condition $e_j \\in \\text{path}(0, i) \\cap \\text{path}(0, k)$ means two things:\n1.  The edge $e_j$ must be on the path from the root to node $i$.\n2.  The edge $e_j$ must also be on the path from the root to node $k$. This implies that node $k$ must be in the subtree rooted at $v_j$.\n\nTherefore, for a given edge $e_j=(u_j, v_j)$ on the path to node $i$, the inner sum accumulates the capacitance of all nodes $k$ in the subtree of its child node $v_j$. This sum is precisely the \"downstream capacitance\" of node $v_j$, which we denote as $C_{\\text{down}}(v_j)$.\n$$ C_{\\text{down}}(v_j) = \\sum_{k \\in \\text{subtree}(v_j)} C_k $$\nSubstituting this back, the Elmore delay at node $i$ is the sum of products of each edge resistance on the path from the root to $i$ and the total capacitance downstream of that edge:\n$$ \\tau_{Di} = \\sum_{e_j=(u_j,v_j) \\in \\text{path}(0,i)} R_j \\cdot C_{\\text{down}}(v_j) $$\nThis expression is the core of the linear-time algorithm. It directly corresponds to the problem's description of \"path-wise accumulation of contributions that combine upstream resistance with downstream capacitance.\"\n\n**3. Algorithmic Design**\n\nThe formula for $\\tau_{Di}$ reveals a clear computational dependency. To calculate the delay at any node, we need:\n1.  The downstream capacitance $C_{\\text{down}}(v)$ for various nodes $v$ on the path.\n2.  The path structure itself.\n\nThis suggests a two-pass algorithm executed over a single traversal of the tree's data structure, which is consistent with the problem's requirement for a \"single Depth-First Search\" that processes each edge a constant number of times.\n\n**Pass 1: Post-Order Traversal to Compute Downstream Capacitance**\nA post-order traversal (a form of DFS) naturally facilitates the bottom-up computation of downstream capacitances. When visiting a node $u$, we first recursively visit all its children. Upon returning from the recursive calls, the downstream capacitances for all children are known. The downstream capacitance of $u$ can then be computed as its own capacitance plus the sum of the downstream capacitances of its children:\n$$ C_{\\text{down}}(u) = C_u + \\sum_{v \\in \\text{children}(u)} C_{\\text{down}}(v) $$\nThis pass starts from the leaves and moves up to the root, populating an array of $C_{\\text{down}}$ values for every node in the tree.\n\n**Pass 2: Pre-Order Traversal to Compute Elmore Delay**\nWith all $C_{\\text{down}}$ values pre-computed, a pre-order traversal (another form of DFS) can compute the delays in a top-down manner. The Elmore delay $\\tau_{Di}$ can be expressed recursively. The delay at the root, $\\tau_{D0}$, is $0$. For any other node $i$ with parent $p$, the path to $i$ is the path to $p$ extended by the edge $(p,i)$. Therefore:\n$$ \\tau_{Di} = \\tau_{Dp} + R_{pi} \\cdot C_{\\text{down}}(i) $$\nwhere $R_{pi}$ is the resistance of the edge from $p$ to $i$. This recursive formula allows us to compute the delay for each node by taking its parent's delay and adding the new contribution from the connecting edge. A pre-order traversal starting from the root with an initial delay of $0$ perfectly implements this top-down accumulation.\n\n**Summary of the Algorithm**\n1.  Represent the RC tree using an adjacency list, where for each parent node, we store a list of its children and the corresponding edge resistances.\n2.  Perform a post-order DFS traversal starting from the root to compute and store the downstream capacitance $C_{\\text{down}}(u)$ for every node $u$.\n3.  Perform a pre-order DFS traversal starting from the root to compute and store the Elmore delay $\\tau_{Du}$ for every node $u$, using the recursive delay formula and the pre-computed $C_{\\text{down}}$ values.\n4.  For each test case, extract the computed delays for the specified leaf nodes and order them by ascending node index.\n\nEach pass visits every node and edge once. The total time complexity is $O(N+E)$, where $N$ is the number of nodes and $E$ is the number of edges. For a tree, $E=N-1$, so the complexity is $O(N)$, fulfilling the linear-time requirement.",
