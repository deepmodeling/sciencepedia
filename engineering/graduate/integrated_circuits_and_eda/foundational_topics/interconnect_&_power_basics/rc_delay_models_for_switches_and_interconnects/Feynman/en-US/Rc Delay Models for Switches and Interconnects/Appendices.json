A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe primary task is to compute the high-to-low propagation delay, $t_{pHL}$, which is the time for the output voltage $V_{\\mathrm{out}}$ to fall from $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$ to the mid-swing point, $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}/2$. This is modeled as the discharge of the load capacitor $C_{L}$ through a composite driver resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{eq}}$.\n\nFirst, we construct the composite resistance model. During the high-to-low transition, the n-channel MOSFET is on, and the p-channel MOSFET is off. The discharge path for the load capacitor $C_L$ is from the output node, through the n-channel MOSFET, to ground. The total resistance in this path, $R_{\\mathrm{eq}}$, is the series combination of the drain contact resistance ($R_{c,d}$), drain extension resistance ($R_{\\mathrm{ext},d}$), the effective channel resistance ($R_{\\mathrm{ch}}$), source extension resistance ($R_{\\mathrm{ext},s}$), and source contact resistance ($R_{c,s}$).\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{eq}} = R_{c,d} + R_{\\mathrm{ext},d} + R_{\\mathrm{ch}} + R_{\\mathrm{ext},s} + R_{c,s}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the channel resistance $R_{\\mathrm{ch}}$ should be derived by linearizing the MOSFET I-V characteristic at the mid-swing output voltage, $V_{\\mathrm{out}} = V_{\\mathrm{DD}}/2$. In this configuration, the output voltage is the n-channel's drain-to-source voltage, $V_{\\mathrm{DS}} = V_{\\mathrm{out}}$. The small-signal channel resistance is the inverse of the output conductance $g_d$:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{ch}} = \\left(g_d\\right)^{-1} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial I_d}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{DS}}} \\right)^{-1} \\Bigg|_{V_{\\mathrm{DS}}=\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}{2}}\n$$\nThe provided drain current equation for the linear region is:\n$$\nI_{d} = \\mu_{n} C_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\frac{W}{L} \\left[\\left(V_{\\mathrm{GS}} - V_{\\mathrm{T},n}\\right) V_{\\mathrm{DS}} - \\frac{1}{2} V_{\\mathrm{DS}}^{2}\\right]\n$$\nLet's define the process transconductance parameter $\\beta_n = \\mu_n C_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\frac{W}{L}$.

We evaluate $g_d$ at the mid-swing point, $V_{\\mathrm{DS}} = V_{\\mathrm{DD}}/2$. First, we must verify that the transistor is indeed in the linear region at this point, i.e., $V_{\\mathrm{DS}}  V_{\\mathrm{GS}} - V_{\\mathrm{T},n}$.\nGiven $V_{\\mathrm{DD}} = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{V}$ and $V_{\\mathrm{T},n} = 0.35\\,\\mathrm{V}$:\n-   $V_{\\mathrm{DS}} = V_{\\mathrm{DD}}/2 = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{V} / 2 = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n-   $V_{\\mathrm{GS}} - V_{\\mathrm{T},n} = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{T},n} = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{V} - 0.35\\,\\mathrm{V} = 0.45\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\nSince $0.4\\,\\mathrm{V}  0.45\\,\\mathrm{V}$, the linear region assumption is valid.\n\nWe now evaluate the conductance at this operating point:\n$$\ng_d\\Big|_{V_{\\mathrm{DS}}=\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}{2}} = \\beta_n \\left(V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{T},n} - \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}{2}\\right) = \\beta_n \\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}{2} - V_{\\mathrm{T},n}\\right)\n$$\nThe effective channel resistance is then:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{ch}} = \\frac{1}{\\beta_n \\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}{2} - V_{\\mathrm{T},n}\\right)}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the numerical value of $\\beta_n$:\n$$\n\\beta_n = \\mu_n C_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\frac{W}{L} = (0.05\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(0.03\\,\\mathrm{F}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}) \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}}{30 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}}\n$$\n$$\n\\beta_n = (0.0015\\,\\mathrm{F}\\,\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\left(\\frac{100}{3}\\right) = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{A}\\,\\mathrm{V}^{-2}\n$$\nNow, we calculate $R_{\\mathrm{ch}}$:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{ch}} = \\frac{1}{(0.05\\,\\mathrm{A}\\,\\mathrm{V}^{-2}) \\left(\\frac{0.8\\,\\mathrm{V}}{2} - 0.35\\,\\mathrm{V}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{0.05 \\times (0.4 - 0.35)} = \\frac{1}{0.05 \\times 0.05} = \\frac{1}{0.0025} = 400\\,\\Omega\n$$\nWith $R_{\\mathrm{ch}}$ computed, we can find the total equivalent resistance $R_{\\mathrm{eq}}$:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{eq}} = R_{c,d} + R_{\\mathrm{ext},d} + R_{\\mathrm{ch}} + R_{\\mathrm{ext},s} + R_{c,s} = 20\\,\\Omega + 40\\,\\Omega + 400\\,\\Omega + 40\\,\\Omega + 20\\,\\Omega = 520\\,\\Omega\n$$\nThe discharge of the capacitor $C_L$ through the resistance $R_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ is described by the first-order differential equation for an RC circuit.

Let us define three nodes: Node $0$ is the input from the Thevenin source, Node $1$ is the midpoint of the interconnect, and Node $2$ is the load node.\n\nThe resistances in the network are:\n-   Resistance between Node $0$ and Node $1$: $R_s + R_c + \\frac{R_l}{2}$\n-   Resistance between Node $1$ and Node $2$: $\\frac{R_l}{2}$\n\nThe capacitances to ground in the network are:\n-   At Node $1$ (midpoint): The problem states a shunt capacitance of $C_g/2$ and an effective coupling capacitance of $\\alpha C_x$ due to the Miller effect. The total capacitance at Node $1$ is $C_1 = \\frac{C_g}{2} + \\alpha C_x$.\n-   At Node $2$ (load): The problem states a shunt capacitance of $C_g/2$ and the load capacitance $C_L$. The total capacitance at Node $2$ is $C_2 = \\frac{C_g}{2} + C_L$.\n\nThe Elmore delay at a node $i$ in an RC tree, $t_{Di}$, is given by the formula:\n$$t_{Di} = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} R_{ik} C_k$$\nwhere $C_k$ is the capacitance at node $k$, and $R_{ik}$ is the resistance of the portion of the path from the input source to node $i$ that is shared with the path from the input source to node $k$. We need to find the Elmore delay at the load, Node $2$, which we denote as $t_{\\mathrm{elmore}}$.\n\nFor our two-capacitor network, the formula for the delay at Node $2$ is:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{elmore}} = t_{D2} = R_{21}C_1 + R_{22}C_2$$\n\nLet's determine the path resistances $R_{21}$ and $R_{22}$:\n-   $R_{21}$ is the resistance common to the paths from the source to Node $2$ and to Node $1$.

            "introduction": "Finally, we use our understanding of RC delay models to inform a practical design decision regarding interconnect layout. Shielding adjacent signal lines is a common strategy to reduce crosstalk, but this benefit can come at the cost of increased delay due to added capacitance. This exercise challenges you to analytically derive the break-even point where the delay penalty of shielding outweighs its benefits, demonstrating how RC models guide critical trade-offs in high-performance design.

            "problem": "A pair of identical, long on-chip interconnects on the same metal layer are separated by an edge-to-edge spacing $s$ in a homogeneous dielectric of permittivity $\\varepsilon$. Each line has per-unit-length series resistance $r$ and per-unit-length ground (substrate) capacitance $c_{g}$ that is approximately independent of $s$ over the spacings of interest. The per-unit-length mutual coupling capacitance between the two signal wires is modeled by\n$$\nc_{m}(s) \\;=\\; \\frac{\\alpha}{s+\\delta},\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha0$ and $\\delta0$ are technology-dependent constants that capture sidewall coupling and fringing fields. The effective contribution of this mutual capacitance to the delay of a signal transition on one wire in the presence of activity on the neighbor is modeled by a Miller coupling factor $k$ with $0\\leq k\\leq 2$, so that the effective per-unit-length capacitance entering an Elmore delay calculation contains an additive term $k\\,c_{m}(s)$.\n\nAn ideal, infinitely long, grounded shield trace is inserted midway between the two signal wires, with negligible width compared to $s$, so that the two gaps between a signal wire and the shield are each $s/2$. The direct mutual coupling between the two signal wires is thereby suppressed. The per-unit-length coupling capacitance between a signal wire and the shield at a gap $g$ is modeled by the same functional form $c_{sh}(g)=\\alpha/(g+\\delta)$.\n\nAssume that:\n- The driver resistance and receiver loading are identical in the shielded and unshielded cases.\n- For a uniformly distributed resistance-capacitance line, the Elmore delay for a step input scales linearly with the total effective per-unit-length capacitance to ground seen by the line.\n\nStarting only from these assumptions and models, do the following:\n- Derive the explicit inequality condition, in terms of $s$, $\\delta$, and $k$, under which adding the shield increases the total effective per-unit-length capacitance sufficiently to increase the Elmore delay compared to the unshielded case.\n- From this, determine the break-even spacing $s_{\\mathrm{be}}$ at which adding the shield neither increases nor decreases the delay relative to the unshielded case.\n\nExpress the final break-even spacing in meters as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of $\\delta$ and $k$. No numerical approximation is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of two related quantities: first, an inequality that determines when inserting a grounded shield between two interconnects increases the Elmore delay, and second, the specific break-even spacing, $s_{\\mathrm{be}}$, at which the delay is identical to the unshielded case. The core of the problem lies in comparing the total effective per-unit-length capacitance for the two configurations. According to the problem statement, the Elmore delay is directly proportional to this effective capacitance.\n\nLet us first determine the total effective per-unit-length capacitance for the unshielded case, denoted as $c_{\\mathrm{eff,unshielded}}$. A given signal wire has a capacitance to ground, $c_g$, and a mutual coupling capacitance to its neighbor, $c_m(s)$. The contribution of the mutual capacitance to the effective capacitance is scaled by the Miller coupling factor $k$. Thus, the total effective capacitance is the sum of the ground capacitance and the effective mutual capacitance:\n$$\nc_{\\mathrm{eff,unshielded}} = c_g + k \\, c_m(s)\n$$\nUsing the provided model for the mutual capacitance, $c_m(s) = \\frac{\\alpha}{s+\\delta}$, where $s$ is the spacing, we have:\n$$\nc_{\\mathrm{eff,unshielded}} = c_g + k \\frac{\\alpha}{s+\\delta}\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the total effective per-unit-length capacitance for the shielded case, denoted as $c_{\\mathrm{eff,shielded}}$. In this configuration, a grounded shield is placed midway between the two signal wires. The problem states that this shield suppresses the direct mutual coupling between the signal wires. However, each signal wire is now capacitively coupled to this new grounded shield. The gap between a signal wire and the shield is $g = s/2$. The capacitance to the shield is given by the model $c_{\\mathrm{sh}}(g) = \\frac{\\alpha}{g+\\delta}$. Since the shield is grounded, this capacitance acts as an additional path to ground and adds directly to the total capacitance. The term related to the Miller effect is eliminated because the direct coupling to the other switching signal wire is suppressed. The total effective capacitance is therefore the sum of the capacitance to the substrate and the capacitance to the shield:\n$$\nc_{\\mathrm{eff,shielded}} = c_g + c_{\\mathrm{sh}}\\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the functional form for $c_{\\mathrm{sh}}$, we get:\n$$\nc_{\\mathrm{eff,shielded}} = c_g + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\frac{s}{2}+\\delta}\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the condition under which adding the shield increases the Elmore delay. This occurs when the effective capacitance of the shielded case is greater than that of the unshielded case:\n$$\nc_{\\mathrm{eff,shielded}}  c_{\\mathrm{eff,unshielded}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above:\n$$\nc_g + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\frac{s}{2}+\\delta}  c_g + k \\frac{\\alpha}{s+\\delta}\n$$\nThe ground capacitance term $c_g$ is common to both sides and can be cancelled:\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha}{\\frac{s}{2}+\\delta}  k \\frac{\\alpha}{s+\\delta}\n$$\nGiven that $\\alpha  0$, we can divide both sides by $\\alpha$ without changing the inequality:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\frac{s}{2}+\\delta}  \\frac{k}{s+\\delta}\n$$\nThe terms in the denominators, $s$, $\\delta$, and $k$, are such that the denominators are positive ($s0$, $\\delta0$). We can therefore cross-multiply without reversing the inequality sign:\n$$\ns+\\delta  k \\left(\\frac{s}{2} + \\delta\\right)\n$$\nExpanding the right side gives:\n$$\ns+\\delta  \\frac{k s}{2} + k \\delta\n$$\nTo find the condition on $s$, we rearrange the inequality by grouping terms involving $s$ on one side and terms involving $\\delta$ on the other:\n$$\ns - \\frac{k s}{2}  k \\delta - \\delta\n$$\nFactoring out $s$ and $\\delta$ yields the explicit inequality condition:\n$$\ns\\left(1 - \\frac{k}{2}\\right)  \\delta(k-1)\n$$\nThis inequality defines the condition on the spacing $s$ under which the shield increases the overall delay.\n\nThe break-even spacing, $s_{\\mathrm{be}}$, is the spacing at which adding the shield neither increases nor decreases the delay. This corresponds to the case of equality in the relationship derived above:\n$$\nc_{\\mathrm{eff,shielded}} = c_{\\mathrm{eff,unshielded}}\n$$\nThis leads to the equality:\n$$\ns_{\\mathrm{be}}\\left(1 - \\frac{k}{2}\\right) = \\delta(k-1)\n$$\nTo solve for $s_{\\mathrm{be}}$, we can first multiply both sides by $2$ to clear the fraction:\n$$\ns_{\\mathrm{be}}(2 - k) = 2\\delta(k-1)\n$$\nAssuming $k \\neq 2$, we can isolate $s_{\\mathrm{be}}$ by dividing by $(2-k)$:\n$$\ns_{\\mathrm{be}} = \\frac{2\\delta(k-1)}{2-k}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the break-even spacing in terms of $\\delta$ and $k$. This expression is physically meaningful (i.e., $s_{\\mathrm{be}}  0$) only when the numerator and denominator have the same sign. Given $0 \\leq k \\leq 2$, the denominator $(2-k)$ is non-negative. For $s_{\\mathrm{be}}$ to be positive, the numerator $2\\delta(k-1)$ must also be positive. Since $\\delta0$, this requires $k-1  0$, or $k  1$. For cases where $k \\le 1$, a positive break-even spacing does not exist, implying that adding a shield is always detrimental or, in the boundary case of $k=1$, equivalent to the unshielded case only at the unphysical limit of $s=0$.",
