            "introduction": "The behavior of ions within the plasma sheath is fundamental to the success of anisotropic dry etching. The energy and directionality with which ions strike the wafer surface are determined by their transit through the sheath's electric field. This exercise allows you to connect macroscopic process parameters, like pressure and temperature, to the microscopic picture of ion transport by calculating the ion-neutral mean free path. By comparing this path length to the sheath thickness, you will quantitatively determine whether the sheath is 'collisionless'—a critical distinction that governs the ion energy distribution at the substrate and, consequently, the etch characteristics.

            "solution": "The problem asks for an evaluation of the collisionality of a plasma sheath by comparing the ion-neutral mean free path to the sheath thickness. The solution requires applying principles from the kinetic theory of gases and the ideal gas law.\n\nThe mean free path, $\\lambda$, is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. For an ion traversing a background of neutral gas atoms, the mean free path is given by the formula:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{1}{n_g \\sigma}\n$$\nwhere $n_g$ is the number density of the neutral gas atoms and $\\sigma$ is the effective cross section for the ion-neutral collision process. This simplified formula is appropriate here because the ions in a sheath are accelerated to velocities much greater than the thermal velocity of the neutral atoms, which can therefore be treated as a stationary target population.\n\nTo calculate $\\lambda$, we must first determine the neutral gas density $n_g$. The problem states that the neutral argon gas can be treated as an ideal gas. The ideal gas law, in terms of number density, is:\n$$\nP = n_g k_B T\n$$\nwhere $P$ is the gas pressure, $T$ is the gas temperature, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.

Model Derivation and Integration**\n\nThe problem states that the etch rate, $R = \\frac{dD}{dt}$, is attenuated by sidewall shadowing in a manner that is first-order in the instantaneous aspect ratio, $AR = D/W$. A widely used, physically-motivated model that captures this behavior is:\n$$\nR(AR) = \\frac{dD}{dt} = \\frac{R_0}{1 + K \\cdot AR}\n$$\nwhere $R_0$ is the open-field etch rate (at $AR=0$) and $K$ is a dimensionless fitting constant. Substituting $AR = D(t)/W$, we obtain the ordinary differential equation for the trench depth $D(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dD}{dt} = \\frac{R_0}{1 + K \\frac{D}{W}} = \\frac{R_0 W}{W + K D}\n$$\nThis is a separable ODE.
