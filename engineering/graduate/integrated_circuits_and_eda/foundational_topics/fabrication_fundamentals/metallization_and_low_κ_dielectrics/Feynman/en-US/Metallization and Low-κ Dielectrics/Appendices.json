During wet cleans and rinses, capillary forces in the liquid-filled gaps between adjacent fins can induce mechanical instabilities that lead to pattern collapse. Consider a periodic array of identical, parallel low-$\\kappa$ fins of height $h$, fin width $w$ (in the lateral bending direction), and large depth along the line direction such that a unit depth is used for analysis. The gap between adjacent fins (measured at the top) is $s$. The liquid has surface tension $\\gamma$ and makes a contact angle $\\theta$ with the dielectric surfaces. The fins are clamped at the base to the substrate and have free tops, and their elastic behavior is characterized by a Young’s modulus $E$. Assume the curvature of the liquid-vapor interface along the line direction is negligible compared to the curvature across the gap, and assume the capillary pressure acts uniformly over the fin sidewall height.

The problem provides a specific, simplified instruction to \"equate the capillary pressure-induced lateral load to the critical buckling load.\" We will follow this recipe.\n\n**1. Define the Capillary Load**\nThe liquid meniscus between the fins creates a suction pressure due to surface tension. For a 2D meniscus in a gap of width $s$ with contact angle $\\theta$, the Young-Laplace equation gives the pressure difference as $P_{cap} = \\gamma/R$, where $R$ is the radius of curvature. Geometry dictates $s = 2R\\cos\\theta$, so $R = s/(2\\cos\\theta)$.\nThe capillary pressure is therefore:\n$$P_{cap} = \\frac{2 \\gamma \\cos\\theta}{s}$$\nThis pressure acts on the inner sidewall of the fin. The problem instructs us to determine the \"capillary pressure-induced lateral load\". We interpret this as the total lateral force per unit depth acting on a fin of height $h$:\n$$F_{lateral} = P_{cap} \\times h = \\frac{2 \\gamma h \\cos\\theta}{s}$$\n\n**2.

Each line has height $H$ and width $W$, and the lateral edge-to-edge spacing between their facing sidewalls is $S$. The lines are embedded in a low-permittivity (\"low-$\\kappa$\") organosilicate glass trench dielectric of relative permittivity $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{d}}$. In addition, process integration uses a conformal etch-stop layer of relative permittivity $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{es}}$ and thickness $\\delta_{\\mathrm{es}}$ as well as a conformal hardmask layer of relative permittivity $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{hm}}$ and thickness $\\delta_{\\mathrm{hm}}$ on the sidewalls of both lines. Assume that these sidewall films deposit sequentially so that, on each sidewall, the etch-stop layer is adjacent to copper and the hardmask layer lies outside the etch-stop layer, before the central trench low-$\\kappa$ fill begins. The remaining central trench width is thus $d_{\\mathrm{core}} = S - 2(\\delta_{\\mathrm{es}} + \\delta_{\\mathrm{hm}})$ and is filled by the low-$\\kappa$ dielectric.\n\nFor advanced analysis, approximate the interline coupling capacitance per unit length between the two adjacent lines using first-principles electrostatics with the following physically justified idealizations:\n- Treat the facing sidewalls over height $H$ as parallel electrodes producing a predominantly transverse electric field across the spacing $S$.\n- Model the lateral dielectric composition across $S$ as a one-dimensional sequence of five slabs (left etch-stop, left hardmask, central low-$\\kappa$ core, right hardmask, right etch-stop) arranged in series along the field direction, each of uniform thickness and constant permittivity.\n- Neglect fringing at the top and bottom edges and any anisotropy, so that the electric displacement is uniform across the cross-sectional area over height $H$.\n\nStarting from Gauss’s law and the constitutive relation for linear dielectrics, derive an expression for the coupling capacitance per unit length in the presence of the sidewall etch-stop and hardmask films, and compare it to the baseline capacitance per unit length when the gap $S$ is entirely filled with the low-$\\kappa$ dielectric. Using this derivation, compute the fractional increase in coupling capacitance per unit length, defined as\n$$\nf \\equiv \\frac{C'_{\\mathrm{with}} - C'_{0}}{C'_{0}},\n$$\nwhere $C'_{\\mathrm{with}}$ is the per-unit-length coupling capacitance with the sidewall films present and $C'_{0}$ is the baseline per-unit-length coupling capacitance without the sidewall films.\n\nUse the following geometrical and material parameters:\n- $H = 52\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $W = 24\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $S = 28\\,\\mathrm{nm}$,\n- $\\delta_{\\mathrm{es}} = 2\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{hm}} = 3\\,\\mathrm{nm}$,\n- $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{d}} = 2.2$, $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{es}} = 7.2$, $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{hm}} = 5.0$.\n\nState and use the vacuum permittivity $\\varepsilon_{0}$ symbolically in your derivation, but evaluate it only if necessary.

The calculation will be based on an idealized parallel-plate capacitor model, as specified.\n\nFirst, let us establish the model based on the problem statement. We consider a section of the two interconnect lines of length $L$. The facing sidewalls act as parallel plates of a capacitor, each with area $A = H \\times L$. The total spacing between the copper lines is $S$.\n\nThe analysis starts from Gauss's law and the constitutive relation for linear, isotropic dielectrics. For a parallel-plate capacitor with surface charge density $\\pm\\sigma$ on the plates, Gauss's law dictates that the magnitude of the electric displacement field $D$ between the plates is uniform and equal to $\\sigma$, provided fringing fields are neglected. Thus, $D = \\sigma$.

The potential difference $V$ between the plates is the integral of the electric field across the gap. The capacitance is defined as $C = Q/V = (\\sigma A)/V$. The capacitance per unit length is $C' = C/L$.\n\nLet's first determine the baseline capacitance per unit length, $C'_{0}$. In this case, the entire space $S$ between the lines is filled with a single low-$\\kappa$ dielectric of relative permittivity $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{d}}$.\nThe electric field is uniform: $E_{0} = D / (\\kappa_{\\mathrm{d}}\\varepsilon_{0})$.\nThe potential difference is $V_{0} = E_{0} S = D S / (\\kappa_{\\mathrm{d}}\\varepsilon_{0})$.\nThe capacitance is $C_{0} = Q/V_{0} = (\\sigma A) / (D S / (\\kappa_{\\mathrm{d}}\\varepsilon_{0})) = (D L H) / (D S / (\\kappa_{\\mathrm{d}}\\varepsilon_{0})) = \\kappa_{\\mathrm{d}}\\varepsilon_{0}LH/S$.\nThe capacitance per unit length is therefore:\n$$\nC'_{0} = \\frac{C_{0}}{L} = \\frac{\\kappa_{\\mathrm{d}}\\varepsilon_{0}H}{S}\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the capacitance per unit length with the sidewall films, $C'_{\\mathrm{with}}$.
