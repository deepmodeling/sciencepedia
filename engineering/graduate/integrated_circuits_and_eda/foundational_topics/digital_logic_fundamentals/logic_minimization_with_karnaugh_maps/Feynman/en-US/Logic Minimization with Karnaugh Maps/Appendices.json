            "solution": "The problem requires the minimization of a four-variable Boolean function, $F(A,B,C,D)$, given as a sum of minterms, into a minimal Sum of Products (SOP) form using a Karnaugh map (K-map).\n\nThe function is defined by its on-set as:\n$$F(A,B,C,D)=\\sum m(2,3,6,7,10,11,14,15)$$\nThe variables are $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$, which correspond to the binary weights $2^3$, $2^2$, $2^1$, and $2^0$, respectively, for a minterm $m_{ABCD}$.\n\nFirst, we construct a $4$-variable K-map. The map is a $4 \\times 4$ grid. The rows are indexed by the variables $A$ and $B$, and the columns are indexed by $C$ and $D$. The indices follow a Gray code sequence ($00, 01, 11, 10$) to ensure that adjacent cells differ by only one variable, which is the foundational principle of the K-map method.\n\nThe minterm numbers are placed into the K-map grid as follows:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\multicolumn{1}{r}{AB\\backslash CD} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{00} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{01} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{11} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{10} \\\\ \\cline{2-5}\n00 & m_0 & m_1 & m_3 & m_2 \\\\ \\cline{2-5}\n01 & m_4 & m_5 & m_7 & m_6 \\\\ \\cline{2-5}\n11 & m_{12} & m_{13} & m_{15} & m_{14} \\\\ \\cline{2-5}\n10 & m_8 & m_9 & m_{11} & m_{10} \\\\ \\cline{2-5}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nNext, we populate the map with '$1$'s for each minterm in the function's on-set: $m_2, m_3, m_6, m_7, m_{10}, m_{11}, m_{14}, m_{15}$. All other cells corresponding to minterms not in the on-set are implicitly '$0$'.\n\nThe resulting K-map for $F(A,B,C,D)$ is:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\multicolumn{1}{r}{AB\\backslash CD} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{00} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{01} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{11} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{10} \\\\ \\cline{2-5}\n00 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ \\cline{2-5}\n01 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ \\cline{2-5}\n11 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ \\cline{2-5}\n10 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ \\cline{2-5}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThe next step is to identify the largest possible groups of adjacent '$1$'s, where the group sizes must be powers of $2$ (e.g., $1, 2, 4, 8, \\dots$). The goal is to cover all '$1$'s with the minimum number of the largest possible groups.\n\nObserving the map, all eight '$1$'s form a single large rectangular block. This block comprises the two rightmost columns. This is a group of $2^3 = 8$ minterms.\nThe group consists of the minterms $\\{m_2, m_3, m_6, m_7, m_{10}, m_{11}, m_{14}, m_{15}\\}$.\n\nWe now determine the product term corresponding to this group by identifying which variables remain constant across all cells in the group.\n- The group spans all four rows, corresponding to $AB$ values of $00$, $01$, $11$, and $10$. Since the values of both $A$ and $B$ change within this group ($A$ is $0$ in the top two rows and $1$ in the bottom two; $B$ is $0$ in the first and fourth rows and $1$ in the second and third rows), both variables $A$ and $B$ are eliminated.\n- The group spans the two columns corresponding to $CD$ values of $11$ and $10$.\n  - For the variable $C$, its value is $1$ in both columns ($CD=11$ and $CD=10$). Since $C$ is constant at $1$, it remains in the product term.\n  - For the variable $D$, its value is $1$ in the $CD=11$ column and $0$ in the $CD=10$ column. Since $D$ changes value within the group, it is eliminated.\n\nTherefore, the only variable that remains constant throughout the entire group is $C=1$. The product term for this group is simply $C$.\n\nSince this single group of eight covers all the '$1$'s in the K-map, it is the only term needed in the minimal SOP expression. No further groups are necessary.\n\nThe final minimized Sum of Products expression for the function is the sum of the terms from all essential prime implicants. In this case, there is only one term.\n$$F_{min}(A,B,C,D) = C$$\n\nThis can be verified through Boolean algebra:\n$F = \\sum m(2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15)$\n$F = A'B'CD' + A'B'CD + A'BCD' + A'BCD + AB'CD' + AB'CD + ABCD' + ABCD$\nFactoring out the common literal $C$:\n$F = C (A'B'D' + A'B'D + A'BD' + A'BD + AB'D' + AB'D + ABD' + ABD)$\nThe expression inside the parenthesis includes all $8$ possible combinations of the variables $A$, $B$, and $D$. A $3$-variable function that is true for all possible input combinations is a tautology, equal to $1$.\nTo show this explicitly:\n$A'B'(D'+D) = A'B'$\n$A'B(D'+D) = A'B$\n$AB'(D'+D) = AB'$\n$AB(D'+D) = AB$\nThe expression simplifies to $C(A'B' + A'B + AB' + AB)$.\nFurther simplification:\n$C(A'(B'+B) + A(B'+B)) = C(A'(1) + A(1)) = C(A'+A) = C(1) = C$.\nThe algebraic simplification confirms the K-map result.",

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. It is a standard problem in digital logic design that can be solved using established principles of Boolean algebra and Karnaugh maps.\n\nThe solution will be developed in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n### Part 1: A Principled Method for Redundant Prime Implicant Detection\n\nA method for identifying redundant prime implicants in the presence of don't-cares, based on first principles, can be formulated as follows:\n\n1.  **Fundamental Definitions**:\n    *   An **implicant** of a Boolean function $F$ is a product term $P$ which implies $F$; that is, whenever $P=1$, $F=1$. For functions with don't-cares ($d$), an implicant of the function $F$ with don't-care set $d$ is a product term $P$ such that for any minterm $m$ covered by $P$, the value of the function at $m$ is either $1$ (on-set) or $X$ (don't-care). The implicant must not cover any minterms where the function's value is $0$ (off-set). Furthermore, an implicant of $F$ must cover at least one minterm from the on-set of $F$.\n    *   A **Prime Implicant (PI)** is an implicant that is no longer a valid implicant if any of its literals are removed. On a Karnaugh map, this corresponds to a rectangular grouping of $1$s and $X$s (of size $2^k$) that is not fully contained within any larger rectangular grouping of $1$s and $X$s.\n    *   An **Essential Prime Implicant (EPI)** is a prime implicant that covers at least one on-set minterm that no other prime implicant covers.\n    *   A **Redundant Prime Implicant** is a prime implicant $P_{red}$ in the context of a chosen cover. If a set of PIs $\\{P_1, ..., P_k\\}$ forms a valid and minimal cover for the function, any PI not in this set is redundant. A more specific definition, useful for the minimization process, is that a PI is redundant with respect to the set of EPIs if all the on-set minterms it covers are also covered by the EPIs.\n\n2.  **Proposed Method**:\n    1.  Construct the Karnaugh map for the given function $F$ with variables $A, B, C$. Populate the map cells with $1$ for on-set minterms, $X$ for don't-care minterms, and $0$ (or leave blank) for off-set minterms.\n    2.  Identify all Prime Implicants (PIs) by finding all maximal rectangular groupings of $1$s and $X$s.\n    3.  Identify all Essential Prime Implicants (EPIs). This is done by inspecting each on-set minterm ($1$). If a minterm is covered by only a single PI, that PI is an EPI.\n    4.  Form an initial sum-of-products expression consisting of all EPIs.\n    5.  Determine the set of on-set minterms covered by the EPIs.\n    6.  If this set constitutes the entire on-set of $F$, then the minimal sum is the sum of the EPIs. Any PI that is not an EPI is, in this case, redundant. Its removal from a potential cover containing all PIs does not affect the function's value on the care set, as its contribution to covering the on-set is already handled by the necessary EPIs.\n    7.  If the EPIs do not cover the entire on-set, the problem reduces to a covering problem for the remaining minterms, which requires selecting a minimal set of non-essential PIs. A non-essential PI is then deemed redundant if it is not selected in the final minimal cover.\n\n### Part 2: Application of the Method to $F(A,B,C)$\n\nThe function is $F(A,B,C)$ with on-set $\\sum m(1,2,3,6,7)$ and don't-care set $d=\\sum m(0,4)$. The off-set is implicitly $\\sum m(5)$.\n\n1.  **Karnaugh Map Construction**: The $3$-variable K-map for $F(A,B,C)$ is constructed. The variable $A$ corresponds to the rows, and the Gray-coded pair $BC$ corresponds to the columns.\n\n    $$\n    \\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}\n    \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \\multicolumn{4}{c}{BC} \\\\\n    \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{00} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{01} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{11} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{10} \\\\\n    \\cline{2-5}\n    A=0 & X_{m0} & 1_{m1} & 1_{m3} & 1_{m2} \\\\\n    \\cline{2-5}\n    A=1 & X_{m4} & 0_{m5} & 1_{m7} & 1_{m6} \\\\\n    \\cline{2-5}\n    \\end{array}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Enumeration of all Prime Implicants (PIs)**: We identify all maximal rectangular groupings of $1$s and $X$s.\n    *   A group of four covering the entire top row ($m_0, m_1, m_2, m_3$) corresponds to the term where $A=0$. This is the term $\\bar{A}$. This is a PI as it cannot be expanded. It covers on-set minterms $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\n    *   A group of four forming a $2 \\times 2$ square in the center two columns ($m_2, m_3, m_6, m_7$) corresponds to the term where $B=1$. This is the term $B$. This is a PI. It covers on-set minterms $\\{2, 3, 6, 7\\}$.\n    *   A group of four covering the four corners ($m_0, m_2, m_4, m_6$) corresponds to the term where $C=0$. This is the term $\\bar{C}$. This is a PI. It covers on-set minterms $\\{2, 6\\}$.\n    *   Any smaller group (e.g., of two cells) is contained within one of these larger groups. For instance, the implicant $AB$ (covering $m_6, m_7$) is fully contained within the implicant $B$. Thus, $AB$ is not a prime implicant. The same applies to all other possible smaller groupings.\n\n    The complete set of prime implicants is $\\{ \\bar{A}, B, \\bar{C} \\}$.\n\n3.  **Identification of Essential and Redundant Prime Implicants**:\n    *   To find EPIs, we check which on-set minterms are covered by only one PI.\n        *   Minterm $m_1$: Is covered only by the PI $\\bar{A}$. Therefore, **$\\bar{A}$ is an Essential Prime Implicant**.\n        *   Minterm $m_2$: Is covered by $\\bar{A}$, $B$, and $\\bar{C}$.\n        *   Minterm $m_3$: Is covered by $\\bar{A}$ and $B$.\n        *   Minterm $m_6$: Is covered by $B$ and $\\bar{C}$.\n        *   Minterm $m_7$: Is covered only by the PI $B$. Therefore, **$B$ is an Essential Prime Implicant**.\n\n    *   The set of EPIs is $\\{\\bar{A}, B\\}$.\n    *   Next, we check the coverage provided by the EPIs. $\\bar{A}$ covers $\\{m_1, m_2, m_3\\}$ and $B$ covers $\\{m_2, m_3, m_6, m_7\\}$. The union of minterms covered by the EPIs is $\\{1, 2, 3\\} \\cup \\{2, 3, 6, 7\\} = \\{1, 2, 3, 6, 7\\}$.\n    *   This set is identical to the function's on-set. Therefore, the EPIs alone are sufficient to realize the function.\n    *   The only remaining PI is $\\bar{C}$. We check if it is redundant. $\\bar{C}$ covers the on-set minterms $\\{m_2, m_6\\}$. Minterm $m_2$ is covered by the EPIs $\\bar{A}$ and $B$. Minterm $m_6$ is covered by the EPI $B$. Since all on-set minterms covered by $\\bar{C}$ are also covered by the set of EPIs, **$\\bar{C}$ is a redundant prime implicant**. Removing it does not change the function on the care set.\n\n### Part 3: Derivation of the Minimum-Cost Sum-of-Products Realization\n\nThe minimum-cost sum-of-products (SOP) expression must include all essential prime implicants. As established in Part 2, the set of EPIs $\\{\\bar{A}, B\\}$ is not only necessary but also sufficient to cover all on-set minterms of the function $F$.\n\nThe minimal cover is therefore the sum of the essential prime implicants:\n$$F(A,B,C) = \\bar{A} + B$$\nThis expression is derived by taking the PIs from the minimal cover identified, which are $\\{\\bar{A}, B\\}$. No further Boolean algebraic simplification (like absorption) can be applied to $\\bar{A} + B$.\n\nThe cost of this realization is:\n*   Number of product terms: $2$.\n*   Total literal count: $1$ (for $\\bar{A}$) + $1$ (for $B$) = $2$.\n\nSince this solution is constructed from only the essential components, it is guaranteed to be a minimal SOP solution according to the specified cost criteria (first number of terms, then number of literals). Any other valid SOP expression cannot have fewer terms or literals.",

Use the conventional canonical minterm indexing with $A$ as the most-significant bit and $D$ as the least-significant bit, i.e., the index $m$ corresponding to $(A,B,C,D)$ is given by $m = 8A + 4B + 2C + D$.

The function $F(A,B,C,D)$ is defined by its on-set $S$ and do-not-care set $X$, and an incorrect implementation $\\widehat{F}$ is provided.\n\nFirst, we formalize the foundational principles. A Boolean function of $n$ variables, here $n=4$, is defined over a universe of $2^n=16$ minterms, $U = \\{m_0, m_1, \\ldots, m_{15}\\}$. The function is specified by partitioning $U$ into three disjoint sets:\n1.  The on-set $S$, containing minterms for which the function must evaluate to $1$.\n2.

This condition ensures two properties:\n-   **Completeness:** All on-set minterms are covered ($S \\subseteq M(G)$).\n-   **Correctness:** No off-set minterms are covered ($M(G) \\cap Z = \\varnothing$).\n\nA systematic procedure for error detection in a proposed expression $\\widehat{F}$ is as follows:\n1.  **Formal Representation:** Identify the on-set $S$, do-not-care set $X$, and off-set $Z$ from the problem specification.\n2.  **Coverage Analysis:** For the proposed expression $\\widehat{F}$, determine the set of minterms it covers, $M(\\widehat{F})$. This is done by finding the set of minterms covered by each product term in $\\widehat{F}$ and taking their union.\n3.  **Error Detection:**\n    a.  **Omission Errors:** These are on-set minterms that are not covered by $\\widehat{F}$.

If $E_{\\text{commission}}$ is non-empty, $\\widehat{F}$ is incorrect.\n\nTo correct the errors and find a minimal SOP expression, one must discard the incorrect expression and perform a\nde novo minimization using a standard method like the Karnaugh map (K-map) technique. This involves finding all prime implicants (PIs) and selecting a minimum-cost subset that forms a valid cover.\n\nNow, we apply this procedure to the specific problem.\n\n**Step 1: Formal Representation**\nThe givens are:\n-   Variables: $A$ (MSB), $B$, $C$, $D$ (LSB).\n-   On-set: $S = \\{0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13\\}$.\n-   Do-not-care set: $X = \\varnothing$.\n-   The universe of minterms is $U = \\{0, 1, \\dots, 15\\}$.\n-   The off-set is $Z = U \\setminus (S \\cup X) = U \\setminus S = \\{3, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15\\}$.\n-   The faulty expression is $\\widehat{F}(A,B,C,D) = \\overline{C} + \\overline{A}\\,\\overline{B}$.\n\n**Step 2: Coverage Analysis of $\\widehat{F}$**\nWe determine the minterms covered by each term in $\\widehat{F}$. A minterm $m_{8A+4B+2C+D}$ is represented by the binary tuple $(A,B,C,D)$.\n-   The term $P_1 = \\overline{C}$ corresponds to the subcube $(A,B,C,D) = (-, -, 0, -)$, where '$-$' indicates the variable can be $0$ or $1$. This covers all minterms where $C=0$.\n    $M(P_1) = M(\\overline{C}) = \\{0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13\\}$.\n-   The term $P_2 = \\overline{A}\\,\\overline{B}$ corresponds to the subcube $(A,B,C,D) = (0, 0, -, -)$.

All other cells corresponding to $Z$ contain $0$s.\n\nThe K-map is as follows, with rows indexed by $AB$ and columns by $CD$ in Gray code:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\multicolumn{1}{r}{CD} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{00} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{01} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{11} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{10} \\\\ \\cline{2-5}\nAB=00 & 1_{0} & 1_{1} & 0_{3} & 1_{2} \\\\ \\cline{2-5}\nAB=01 & 1_{4} & 1_{5} & 0_{7} & 1_{6} \\\\ \\cline{2-5}\nAB=11 & 1_{12} & 1_{13} & 0_{15} & 0_{14} \\\\ \\cline{2-5}\nAB=10 & 1_{8} & 1_{9} & 0_{11} & 0_{10} \\\\ \\cline{2-5}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nNext, we identify all prime implicants (PIs) by finding the largest possible rectangular groups of $1$s that are not contained within any other larger group.\n-   A group of eight $1$s covers minterms $\\{0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13\\}$. The only variable that remains constant in this group is $C=0$. This corresponds to the prime implicant $P_1 = \\overline{C}$. This group cannot be expanded.\n-   A group of four $1$s covers minterms $\\{0, 2, 4, 6\\}$. The variables that remain constant are $A=0$ and $D=0$. This corresponds to the prime implicant $P_2 = \\overline{A}\\,\\overline{D}$. This group also cannot be expanded.\n-   Any other potential group is contained within one of these two. For instance, the group of two $1$s covering $\\{2, 6\\}$ (implicant $\\overline{A}C\\overline{D}$) is not prime because it is fully contained within the larger group for $P_2 = \\overline{A}\\,\\overline{D}$.\n\nThe set of all prime implicants is $\\{ \\overline{C}, \\overline{A}\\,\\overline{D} \\}$.\n\nNow, we must select a minimal subset of these PIs to cover the entire on-set $S$. We do this by identifying essential prime implicants (EPIs), which are PIs that cover an on-set minterm no other PI can cover.\n-   Minterm $m_1$ (among others like $m_5, m_9, m_{13}$) is covered only by the prime implicant $\\overline{C}$. Therefore, $\\overline{C}$ is an essential prime implicant.\n-   Minterm $m_6$ (and $m_2$) is covered only by the prime implicant $\\overline{A}\\,\\overline{D}$. Therefore, $\\overline{A}\\,\\overline{D}$ is also an essential prime implicant.\n\nSince both prime implicants are essential, the minimal SOP expression must be their sum. The set of PIs chosen for the final cover is $\\{\\overline{C}, \\overline{A}\\,\\overline{D}\\}$. The corrected minimal sum-of-products expression is the sum of these PIs.\n\nFinal Corrected Expression: $F(A,B,C,D) = \\overline{C} + \\overline{A}\\,\\overline{D}$.\nThis expression covers the set of minterms $M(\\overline{C}) \\cup M(\\overline{A}\\,\\overline{D}) = \\{0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13\\} \\cup \\{0, 2, 4, 6\\} = \\{0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13\\}$, which is exactly the on-set $S$. The cover is both complete and correct.",
