            "problem": "Consider the design of a hierarchical $6$-to-$64$ decoder within the framework of Electronic Design Automation (EDA). A decoder is a combinational logic block that maps $n$-bit binary inputs to $2^{n}$ one-hot outputs, where exactly one output is asserted for each input pattern. In this task, you are to construct a two-stage hierarchical decoder using predecoding with a $2$-$2$-$2$ input partition, and then determine the minimal achievable maximum gate fan-in required by any gate in the entire implementation under explicit architectural constraints.\n\nUse the following fundamental bases in your reasoning:\n- A $n$-to-$2^{n}$ decoder realizes all $2^{n}$ minterms of the $n$ input variables, each output corresponding to a unique conjunction of input literals.\n- In hierarchical predecoding, input bits are partitioned into groups, and each group is predecoded into one-hot lines representing all combinations of the group’s literals. The final stage forms each decoder output as a conjunction of one selected predecode line from each group.\n- The fan-in of a gate is defined as the number of distinct input terminals to that gate.\n\nDesign constraints for this problem:\n- Partition the $6$ inputs into three disjoint groups of $2$ bits each (a $2$-$2$-$2$ partition). For each $2$-bit group, generate $4$ one-hot predecode signals that represent the four minterms of the two bits and their complements.\n- The final $64$ outputs must each be realized by a single gate that directly combines exactly one predecode signal from each of the three groups to form the corresponding minterm. Multi-level decomposition inside the final stage is not permitted; that is, do not introduce additional intermediate gates to split or tree the final conjunctions.\n- You may use inverters freely to form complemented literals within predecoders.\n- You may implement conjunctions using any single primitive gate with appropriate polarity (for example, an AND gate or its De Morgan equivalents such as a NAND feeding an inverter), provided the final-stage constraint above is met.\n\nCompute, in closed form, the minimal possible value of the maximum gate fan-in across all gates in the entire hierarchical decoder implementation under the stipulated $2$-$2$-$2$ predecode architecture. Express your final answer as a single integer. Do not include units. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the minimal possible value of the maximum gate fan-in for a hierarchically designed $6$-to-$64$ decoder. The design is explicitly constrained by a specific two-stage architecture involving predecoding. The analysis will proceed by examining the fan-in requirements of each stage of the specified implementation.\n\nLet the $6$ input variables to the decoder be denoted by the set $\\{I_5, I_4, I_3, I_2, I_1, I_0\\}$.\n\n**Problem Deconstruction and Analysis of Stages**\n\nThe specified architecture consists of two main stages:\n1.  A predecoder stage where the $6$ inputs are partitioned.\n2.  A final output stage that combines the signals from the predecoder stage.\n\nWe must analyze the fan-in requirements for the logic gates in each of these stages. The overall maximum fan-in will be the maximum value found across all gates in the entire design.\n\n**Stage 1: The Predecoder Stage**\n\nThe problem mandates a $2$-$2$-$2$ partition of the $6$ input bits. Let us define the three disjoint groups of inputs as:\n- Group 1: $G_1 = \\{I_5, I_4\\}$\n- Group 2: $G_2 = \\{I_3, I_2\\}$\n- Group 3: $G_3 = \\{I_1, I_0\\}$\n\nFor each group, a predecoder is implemented. This predecoder is a $2$-to-$4$ decoder, which generates the $2^2 = 4$ minterms of its two input variables. Let's analyze the predecoder for Group 3, $\\{I_1, I_0\\}$, without loss of generality, as all three predecoders are structurally identical.\n\nThe four minterms for inputs $I_1$ and $I_0$ are:\n- $P_{3,0} = \\overline{I_1} \\land \\overline{I_0}$\n- $P_{3,1} = \\overline{I_1} \\land I_0$\n- $P_{3,2} = I_1 \\land \\overline{I_0}$\n- $P_{3,3} = I_1 \\land I_0$\n\nThe problem allows for the free use of inverters to generate the complemented literals ($\\overline{I_1}$ and $\\overline{I_0}$). An inverter is a logic gate with a fan-in of $1$.\n\nEach minterm is a conjunction of $2$ literals. To implement this conjunction using a single primitive gate (as stipulated, e.g., an AND gate), the gate must accept these $2$ literals as its inputs. The fan-in of a gate is the number of its inputs. Therefore, each of the four gates producing the predecoded outputs for a given group will have a fan-in of $2$.\n\nThe gates used in this stage are inverters (fan-in of $1$) and the $2$-input gates for forming the minterms (fan-in of $2$). The maximum fan-in required in the predecoder stage is therefore $2$.\n\n**Stage 2: The Final Output Stage**\n\nThe final stage synthesizes the $64$ outputs of the $6$-to-$64$ decoder. The inputs to this stage are the outputs from the three predecoders.\n- Predecoder for $G_1$ provides $4$ signals: $\\{P_{1,0}, P_{1,1}, P_{1,2}, P_{1,3}\\}$.\n- Predecoder for $G_2$ provides $4$ signals: $\\{P_{2,0}, P_{2,1}, P_{2,2}, P_{2,3}\\}$.\n- Predecoder for $G_3$ provides $4$ signals: $\\{P_{3,0}, P_{3,1}, P_{3,2}, P_{3,3}\\}$.\n\nThe problem states that each of the $64$ final outputs must be realized by a single gate that directly combines exactly one predecode signal from each of the three groups.\n\nLet's consider an arbitrary output of the decoder, corresponding to the input bit pattern $I_5I_4I_3I_2I_1I_0$. This $6$-bit word can be seen as the concatenation of three $2$-bit words, one for each group. For an input combination $(i_5i_4, i_3i_2, i_1i_0)$, where each pair represents the state of the inputs in a group, the corresponding output is formed by the conjunction of the predecoded minterms.\n\nFor example, the output $Y_k$ corresponding to the input pattern is given by:\n$$Y_k = P_{1,j_1} \\land P_{2,j_2} \\land P_{3,j_3}$$\nwhere $j_1$ is the integer value of the bit pair $(I_5, I_4)$, $j_2$ is the integer value of $(I_3, I_2)$, and $j_3$ is the integer value of $(I_1, I_0)$.\n\nAccording to the design constraint, this conjunction must be implemented by a *single* gate. The inputs to this gate are the three predecoded signals: $P_{1,j_1}$, $P_{2,j_2}$, and $P_{3,j_3}$. The number of inputs is $3$. Consequently, the fan-in of each of the $64$ gates in the final output stage must be exactly $3$.\n\nThe constraint that \"Multi-level decomposition inside the final stage is not permitted\" is critical. It explicitly forbids replacing each $3$-input gate with, for instance, a tree of $2$-input gates. Therefore, the fan-in of $3$ is a mandatory requirement for this stage.\n\n**Conclusion: Overall Maximum Fan-in**\n\nTo find the maximum gate fan-in for the entire hierarchical decoder, we must consider all gates used in the implementation:\n- Inverters used to generate literal complements: Fan-in = $1$.\n- Gates in the predecoder stage used to form $2$-variable minterms: Fan-in = $2$.\n- Gates in the final output stage used to form $6$-variable minterms from predecoded signals: Fan-in = $3$.\n\nThe set of all fan-in values required by the gates in this specific design is $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$. The maximum value in this set is $3$. The phrase \"minimal achievable maximum gate fan-in\" refers to the maximum fan-in that is necessitated by this particular, explicitly defined architecture. Within the given constraints, it is not possible to construct the circuit with a smaller maximum fan-in. Thus, the minimal achievable maximum gate fan-in is $3$.",

            "problem": "Consider a $4$-to-$2$ priority encoder implemented as a combinational network in the domain of Integrated Circuits and Electronic Design Automation (EDA). The encoder has active-high inputs $I_3$, $I_2$, $I_1$, $I_0$ with strict priority $I_3 \\succ I_2 \\succ I_1 \\succ I_0$. The outputs are the $2$-bit binary code $(Y_1, Y_0)$ representing the index of the highest asserted input, and there is no explicit valid output. All signals are binary-valued and the network is constructed using ideal Boolean operators $+$ (logical disjunction), $\\cdot$ (logical conjunction), and $\\overline{(\\cdot)}$ (logical complement), with gates having positive but otherwise arbitrary and unequal finite propagation delays. Assume no hazards are present on the inputs themselves.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definition of a priority encoder as a mapping from input patterns to encoded outputs, derive a minimal sum-of-products Boolean expression for the most significant output bit $Y_1$ purely from the truth table implied by the priority relation. Then, using the definition of a static-$1$ hazard (an undesired output fall when the Boolean function is logically $1$ before and after a single input transition), identify a single-input transition scenario that can induce a static-$1$ hazard at $Y_1$ in the minimal realization. Next, apply first principles of Boolean algebra and the consensus theorem to design redundant logic that eliminates this static-$1$ hazard in a delay-insensitive manner. In particular, determine the explicit consensus term that must be added to $Y_1$ so that the output $Y_1$ exhibits monotonic behavior (no falling transient) during that single-input transition for any relative gate delays.\n\nExpress the final answer as the single added consensus term written as a Boolean expression using $+$, $\\cdot$, and $\\overline{(\\cdot)}$ notation.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a hazard-eliminating consensus term for the most significant output bit, $Y_1$, of a $4$-to-$2$ priority encoder. The validation and solution process will proceed in structured steps.\n\n### Step 1: Problem Validation\n\n**Extracted Givens:**\n1.  **Device:** A $4$-to-$2$ priority encoder.\n2.  **Inputs:** Active-high signals $I_3, I_2, I_1, I_0$.\n3.  **Priority Scheme:** Strict priority is defined as $I_3 \\succ I_2 \\succ I_1 \\succ I_0$.\n4.  **Outputs:** A $2$-bit binary code $(Y_1, Y_0)$ representing the index of the highest-priority asserted input.\n5.  **Valid Output:** No explicit 'valid' output signal is specified. This implies that the case where all inputs are $0$ can be treated as a 'don't care' condition for the outputs.\n6.  **Logic Model:** The network is constructed from ideal Boolean operators for logical disjunction ($+$), conjunction ($\\cdot$), and complement ($\\overline{(\\cdot)}$).\n7.  **Delay Model:** Gates have positive, finite, but arbitrary and unequal propagation delays.\n8.  **Input Stability:** The inputs themselves are assumed to be free of hazards.\n9.  **Objective:** Derive the minimal sum-of-products (SOP) for $Y_1$, identify a single-input transition causing a static-$1$ hazard, and determine the consensus term required to eliminate this hazard. The final answer is this consensus term.\n\n**Validation Analysis:**\nThe problem is well-defined within the domain of digital logic design, a sub-field of integrated circuits and electronic design automation (EDA). Its premises are scientifically grounded in established Boolean algebra and the theory of combinational logic hazards. The definition of the priority encoder, the priority scheme, and the delay model are standard and internally consistent. The task is to apply fundamental principles (truth table derivation, Karnaugh map minimization, and the consensus theorem) to analyze and correct a logic hazard, which is a classic, well-posed problem in this field. The problem statement is objective, precise, and contains all necessary information to arrive at a unique, verifiable solution. No flaws related to scientific unsoundness, ambiguity, or incompleteness are present.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Minimal SOP for $Y_1$\n\nThe output $Y_1$ represents the most significant bit of the encoded index of the highest-priority asserted input. The inputs are $I_3, I_2, I_1, I_0$, corresponding to indices $3, 2, 1, 0$. The binary representation of the index is $(Y_1Y_0)$.\n-   Index $3 = (11)_2$, so for $I_3$, $Y_1=1$.\n-   Index $2 = (10)_2$, so for $I_2$, $Y_1=1$.\n-   Index $1 = (01)_2$, so for $I_1$, $Y_1=0$.\n-   Index $0 = (00)_2$, so for $I_0$, $Y_1=0$.\n\nBased on the priority rule $I_3 \\succ I_2 \\succ I_1 \\succ I_0$, the truth table for $Y_1$ is constructed as follows, using 'X' to denote don't-care conditions:\n-   If $I_3=1$, the index is $3$, so $Y_1=1$. The values of $I_2, I_1, I_0$ are irrelevant.\n-   If $I_3=0$ and $I_2=1$, the index is $2$, so $Y_1=1$. The values of $I_1, I_0$ are irrelevant.\n-   If $I_3=0$, $I_2=0$, and $I_1=1$, the index is $1$, so $Y_1=0$.\n-   If $I_3=0$, $I_2=0$, $I_1=0$, and $I_0=1$, the index is $0$, so $Y_1=0$.\n-   If all inputs are $0$, the output is undefined, which we treat as a don't-care case.\n\nThis logic can be summarized in a Karnaugh map for $Y_1$ with inputs $I_3, I_2, I_1, I_0$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}\n\\mathbf{I_3I_2 \\backslash I_1I_0} & \\mathbf{00} & \\mathbf{01} & \\mathbf{11} & \\mathbf{10} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\mathbf{00} & X & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\mathbf{01} & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n\\mathbf{11} & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n\\mathbf{10} & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nTo find the minimal sum-of-products (SOP) expression, we group the $1$s into the largest possible rectangular blocks of size $2^k$.\n1.  The eight $1$s in the bottom two rows (where $I_3=1$) form a group. This gives the prime implicant $P_1 = I_3$.\n2.  The remaining uncovered $1$s are in the second row (where $I_3=0, I_2=1$). These four $1$s form a group, giving the prime implicant $P_2 = \\overline{I_3} \\cdot I_2$.\n\nBoth prime implicants are essential. Therefore, the minimal SOP expression for $Y_1$ is the sum of these essential prime implicants:\n$$Y_1 = I_3 + \\overline{I_3} \\cdot I_2$$\n\n### Step 3: Identification of a Static-1 Hazard\n\nA static-$1$ hazard is a momentary, unwanted $0 \\to 1 \\to 0$ or $1 \\to 0 \\to 1$ transition on an output that should remain stable at $1$. In an SOP expression, this can occur when a single input variable changes, causing one product term to become $0$ while another product term becomes $1$. If there is a delay discrepancy, the output of the OR gate may momentarily become $0$.\n\nThe expression $Y_1 = I_3 + \\overline{I_3} \\cdot I_2$ depends on $I_3$ and its complement $\\overline{I_3}$. This structure is susceptible to a hazard when $I_3$ changes. For a static-$1$ hazard, the output must be $1$ both before and after the transition. This requires that the other variables in the terms force the expression to $1$.\n\nLet us fix $I_2=1$ and consider the transition of $I_3$ from $0$ to $1$.\n-   **Initial State:** Let the input be $(I_3, I_2, I_1, I_0) = (0, 1, 0, 0)$.\n    The output is $Y_1 = 0 + \\overline{0} \\cdot 1 = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$. The term $\\overline{I_3} \\cdot I_2$ is holding the output high.\n-   **Final State:** The input transitions to $(I_3, I_2, I_1, I_0) = (1, 1, 0, 0)$.\n    The output is $Y_1 = 1 + \\overline{1} \\cdot 1 = 1 + 0 = 1$. The term $I_3$ is now holding the output high.\n\nThe transition scenario is: $I_3$ changes from $0$ to $1$ while $I_2$ is held at $1$.\nDuring this transition, due to gate delays, the change in $I_3$ propagates through two paths to the final OR gate:\n1.  Path 1: The direct input $I_3$.\n2.  Path 2: Through an inverter to create $\\overline{I_3}$, then an AND gate with $I_2$.\n\nWhen $I_3$ switches $0 \\to 1$, the term $\\overline{I_3} \\cdot I_2$ will switch from $1 \\to 0$ after some delay (sum of inverter and AND gate delays). The term $I_3$ will switch from $0 \\to 1$ after its own wiring delay. If the path for $I_3$ is slower than the path for $\\overline{I_3} \\cdot I_2$, there can be a moment when both inputs to the final OR gate are $0$, causing $Y_1$ to glitch to $0$. This confirms the existence of a potential static-$1$ hazard.\n\n### Step 4: Application of the Consensus Theorem to Eliminate the Hazard\n\nThe consensus theorem provides a systematic method to eliminate such hazards. For an expression of the form $A \\cdot B + \\overline{A} \\cdot C$, the static hazard associated with transitions of $A$ can be eliminated by adding the consensus term $B \\cdot C$.\n\nOur expression for $Y_1$ is $I_3 + \\overline{I_3} \\cdot I_2$. We can write this as $I_3 \\cdot 1 + \\overline{I_3} \\cdot I_2$ to match the theorem's form.\n-   Let $A = I_3$.\n-   Let $B = 1$.\n-   Let $C = I_2$.\n\nThe consensus term is $B \\cdot C = 1 \\cdot I_2 = I_2$.\n\nTo eliminate the hazard, this consensus term must be added to the original SOP expression:\n$$Y_{1, \\text{hazard-free}} = I_3 + \\overline{I_3} \\cdot I_2 + I_2$$\n\nThis new expression contains a redundant term, $I_2$. Algebraically, the expression simplifies:\n$$Y_{1, \\text{hazard-free}} = I_3 + (\\overline{I_3} \\cdot I_2 + I_2) = I_3 + I_2 \\cdot (\\overline{I_3} + 1) = I_3 + I_2 \\cdot 1 = I_3 + I_2$$\n\nIn the hazard-free realization, during the transition $I_3: 0 \\to 1$ with $I_2=1$, the added term $I_2$ remains at $1$ throughout, ensuring that at least one input to the final OR gate is always $1$. This \"bridges the gap\" between the de-assertion of $\\overline{I_3} \\cdot I_2$ and the assertion of $I_3$, thus preventing any glitch at the output $Y_1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the explicit consensus term that must be added. As determined above, this term is $I_2$.",

The tree is balanced in the sense that every data input traverses the same number of levels $k$ and each level has the same branching factor $b$, so that $b^{k} = 32$.

Each data input source has an effective input capacitance $C_{\\text{in}} = C_{\\text{inv}}$, so the path electrical effort is $H = C_{L}/C_{\\text{in}}$.\n\nUse the standard logical effort formalism: the delay of stage $i$ is $d_{i} = g_{i} h_{i} + p_{i}$, the total path delay is $D = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} d_{i}$, the path effort is $F = G B H$ where $G = \\prod_{i=1}^{k} g_{i}$ is the path logical effort, $B = \\prod_{i=1}^{k} b_{i}$ is the path branching effort, and $H$ is the path electrical effort.

A first-principles estimate, consistent with the logical effort method’s normalization to the minimum inverter, is to model this by $g \\approx 2$ for the tri-state inverter.

For $b = 32$ and $k = 1$:\n   - $H^{1/k} = 1024^{1/1} = 1024$.\n   - $g\\,H^{1/k} = 2 \\cdot 1024 = 2048$.\n   - $p(32) = 2 + (32-1) = 33$.\n   - $D(32) = 1(2048 + 33) = 2081$.\n\nComparing the two delays, $D(2) = 55$ and $D(32) = 2081$, the smaller delay is obtained with $b = 2$. Hence, the optimal branching factor that minimizes worst-case delay, among balanced-tree admissible $b$, is\n$$\nb^{\\star} = 2\n$$",
