            "problem": "Consider a Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) logic library intended for Electronic Design Automation (EDA) timing optimization. Assume the Resistive-Capacitive (RC) delay model, where the propagation delay scales proportionally to the product of an effective on-resistance and the capacitive load. Use first principles of Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) conduction to model the on-resistance scaling with device width for minimum-length transistors as follows: the on-resistance of an $n$-channel device scales as $r_{n}/W$ and that of a $p$-channel device scales as $r_{p}/W$, where $r_{n}$ and $r_{p}$ are per-unit-width on-resistances and $W$ is the device width. Let the gate capacitance per unit width for both $n$-channel and $p$-channel transistors be $c_{g}$.\n\nDefine the sizing of a reference inverter by equalizing its pull-down and pull-up effective on-resistances under the RC model. Let the $n$-channel inverter width be $W_{n,\\text{inv}}=1$ and define the $p$-channel width $W_{p,\\text{inv}}$ from the equal-resistance condition.

Analyze the $k$-input NOR gate. 4. Compute the logical efforts.\n\n**1. Reference Inverter Characterization**\n\nThe reference inverter is sized to have equal pull-up and pull-down resistances.\nThe pull-down resistance, $R_{\\text{pd,inv}}$, is provided by a single $n$-channel transistor of width $W_{n,\\text{inv}}$.\n$$R_{\\text{pd,inv}} = \\frac{r_n}{W_{n,\\text{inv}}}$$\nGiven $W_{n,\\text{inv}} = 1$, the pull-down resistance is:\n$$R_{\\text{pd,inv}} = \\frac{r_n}{1} = r_n$$\nThe pull-up resistance, $R_{\\text{pu,inv}}$, is provided by a single $p$-channel transistor of width $W_{p,\\text{inv}}$.\n$$R_{\\text{pu,inv}} = \\frac{r_p}{W_{p,\\text{inv}}}$$\nThe sizing condition is $R_{\\text{pu,inv}} = R_{\\text{pd,inv}}$.\n$$\\frac{r_p}{W_{p,\\text{inv}}} = r_n$$\nSolving for the $p$-channel width, $W_{p,\\text{inv}}$:\n$$W_{p,\\text{inv}} = \\frac{r_p}{r_n}$$\nUsing the given definition $\\rho = r_p/r_n$, we have:\n$$W_{p,\\text{inv}} = \\rho$$\nThe matched drive strength, or effective on-resistance, of the reference inverter is $R_{\\text{inv}} = r_n$.\n\nThe input capacitance of the reference inverter, $C_{\\text{in,inv}}$, is the sum of the gate capacitances of its two transistors. The gate capacitance of a transistor is $c_g W$.\n$$C_{\\text{in,inv}} = c_g W_{n,\\text{inv}} + c_g W_{p,\\text{inv}} = c_g(W_{n,\\text{inv}} + W_{p,\\text{inv}})$$\nSubstituting the widths:\n$$C_{\\text{in,inv}} = c_g(1 + \\rho)$$\n\n**2. $k$-Input NAND Gate Analysis**\n\nA $k$-input NAND gate consists of $k$ $n$-channel transistors in series in the pull-down network (PDN) and $k$ $p$-channel transistors in parallel in the pull-up network (PUN). Let the widths be $W_{n,\\text{nand}}$ and $W_{p,\\text{nand}}$, respectively for each transistor.\n\nThe worst-case pull-down resistance occurs when all $k$ series $n$-channel transistors are conducting.

Let the widths be $W_{n,\\text{nor}}$ and $W_{p,\\text{nor}}$, respectively.\n\nThe worst-case pull-down resistance occurs when only one of the $k$ parallel $n$-channel transistors is conducting.\n$$R_{\\text{pd,nor}} = \\frac{r_n}{W_{n,\\text{nor}}}$$\nTo match the inverter's drive strength, we set $R_{\\text{pd,nor}} = R_{\\text{inv}} = r_n$.\n$$\\frac{r_n}{W_{n,\\text{nor}}} = r_n \\implies W_{n,\\text{nor}} = 1$$\n\nThe worst-case pull-up resistance occurs when all $k$ series $p$-channel transistors are conducting. The total resistance is the sum of individual resistances.\n$$R_{\\text{pu,nor}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{r_p}{W_{p,\\text{nor}}} = k \\frac{r_p}{W_{p,\\text{nor}}}$$\nTo match the inverter's drive strength, we set $R_{\\text{pu,nor}} = R_{\\text{inv}} = r_n$.\n$$k \\frac{r_p}{W_{p,\\text{nor}}} = r_n \\implies W_{p,\\text{nor}} = k \\frac{r_p}{r_n} = k\\rho$$\n\nThe input capacitance of a single input of the NOR gate, $C_{\\text{in,nor}}$, connects to one $n$-channel and one $p$-channel transistor.\n$$C_{\\text{in,nor}} = c_g W_{n,\\text{nor}} + c_g W_{p,\\text{nor}} = c_g(1 + k\\rho)$$\n\nThe logical effort of the NOR gate, $g_{\\text{nor}}$, is the ratio of its input capacitance to that of the reference inverter.\n$$g_{\\text{nor}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{in,nor}}}{C_{\\text{in,inv}}} = \\frac{c_g(1 + k\\rho)}{c_g(1 + \\rho)} = \\frac{1 + k\\rho}{1 + \\rho}$$\n\nThe final expressions for the logical efforts of the $k$-input NAND and NOR gates are therefore established in terms of $k$ and $\\rho$.",

            "problem": "A complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor inverter is characterized for output fall delay under a specific input transition and loading condition. Two industry-standard macromodeling approaches are considered: the Non-Linear Delay Model (NLDM) and the Composite Current Source (CCS). The NLDM (Non-Linear Delay Model) abstracts the driver as a voltage-controlled resistor, whereas the CCS (Composite Current Source) abstracts the driver as a voltage-dependent current source.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in standard integrated circuit delay modeling techniques (NLDM and CCS), well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively formulated.\n\nThe solution is determined in two parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: NLDM-predicted output fall delay\n\nThe Non-Linear Delay Model (NLDM) approximates the pull-down network of the inverter as a single effective resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. The circuit during the output fall transition is modeled as a capacitor $C_{L}$ discharging to ground through this resistor $R_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. The initial voltage on the capacitor is $V_{\\mathrm{out}}(0) = V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$.\n\nThe voltage at the output node, $V_{\\mathrm{out}}(t)$, follows the equation for an RC circuit discharge:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{out}}(t) = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{R_{\\mathrm{eff}} C_{L}}\\right)\n$$\nThe output fall delay, $t_{\\mathrm{NLDM}}$, is defined as the time for $V_{\\mathrm{out}}(t)$ to reach $0.5 V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$. We set $V_{\\mathrm{out}}(t_{\\mathrm{NLDM}}) = 0.5 V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$:\n$$\n0.5 V_{\\mathrm{DD}} = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\mathrm{NLDM}}}{R_{\\mathrm{eff}} C_{L}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n0.5 = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\mathrm{NLDM}}}{R_{\\mathrm{eff}} C_{L}}\\right)\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln(0.5) = -\\frac{t_{\\mathrm{NLDM}}}{R_{\\mathrm{eff}} C_{L}}\n$$\nUsing the property $\\ln(0.5) = -\\ln(2)$, we solve for $t_{\\mathrm{NLDM}}$:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{NLDM}} = R_{\\mathrm{eff}} C_{L} \\ln(2)\n$$\nThis equation shows that in the NLDM model, the delay is directly proportional to the load capacitance $C_{L}$. The problem states that $R_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is load-independent. We can use the provided calibration point ($t_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 4.0 \\,\\mathrm{ps}$ for $C_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 10 \\,\\mathrm{fF}$) to find the delay for the target load $C_{L} = 20 \\,\\mathrm{fF}$.\n\nThe relationship is linear:\n$$\n\\frac{t_{\\mathrm{NLDM}}}{C_{L}} = \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{C_{\\mathrm{ref}}} = R_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\ln(2)\n$$\nTherefore, we can calculate $t_{\\mathrm{NLDM}}$ by scaling the reference delay:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{NLDM}} = t_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\frac{C_{L}}{C_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{NLDM}} = (4.0 \\,\\mathrm{ps}) \\frac{20 \\,\\mathrm{fF}}{10 \\,\\mathrm{fF}} = 4.0 \\times 2 \\,\\mathrm{ps} = 8.0 \\,\\mathrm{ps}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the NLDM-predicted delay is $8.000 \\,\\mathrm{ps}$.\n\nPart 2: CCS-predicted output fall delay\n\nThe Composite Current Source (CCS) model approximates the pull-down network as a voltage-dependent current source, $I_{\\mathrm{CCS}}(V_{\\mathrm{out}})$. The current from this source discharges the load capacitor $C_{L}$. The governing differential equation is derived from the definition of capacitance, $I = C \\frac{dV}{dt}$. The discharge current flowing out of the node is $I_{\\mathrm{CCS}}$, so:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{CCS}}(V_{\\mathrm{out}}) = -C_{L} \\frac{dV_{\\mathrm{out}}}{dt}\n$$\nTo find the fall delay, $t_{\\mathrm{CCS}}$, we separate variables and integrate. The delay is the time for $V_{\\mathrm{out}}$ to fall from $V_{\\mathrm{DD}} = 1.0 \\,\\mathrm{V}$ to $0.5 V_{\\mathrm{DD}} = 0.5 \\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n$$\ndt = -C_{L} \\frac{dV_{\\mathrm{out}}}{I_{\\mathrm{CCS}}(V_{\\mathrm{out}})}\n$$\nIntegrating from $t=0$ to $t=t_{\\mathrm{CCS}}$:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{CCS}} = \\int_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{CCS}}} dt = \\int_{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}^{0.5V_{\\mathrm{DD}}} -C_{L} \\frac{dV_{\\mathrm{out}}}{I_{\\mathrm{CCS}}(V_{\\mathrm{out}})} = C_{L} \\int_{0.5V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}^{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}} \\frac{dV_{\\mathrm{out}}}{I_{\\mathrm{CCS}}(V_{\\mathrm{out}})}\n$$\nThe provided current model is a piecewise function of $V_{\\mathrm{out}}$ (in volts):\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{CCS}}(V_{\\mathrm{out}}) = \n\\begin{cases}\nI_{0},  0.7 \\leq V_{\\mathrm{out}} \\leq 1.0, \\\\\nI_{0}\\,\\dfrac{V_{\\mathrm{out}}}{0.7},  0 \\leq V_{\\mathrm{out}}  0.7,\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nOur integration range is from $0.5 \\,\\mathrm{V}$ to $1.0 \\,\\mathrm{V}$.

It uses standard models for propagation delay analysis: the Logical Effort method, a simplified macroscopic model, and an effective-current model, which is a more physically detailed approach. The alpha-power law is a standard empirical model for short-channel MOSFETs. All provided values ($V_{DD}$, $V_T$, device sizes, currents, capacitances) are physically realistic for a somewhat mature semiconductor technology node.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides sufficient data to calculate the delay using the Logical Effort model and to reason physically about the behavior of the effective-current model. The question asks for a comparison of predictions from these two models and an explanation of discrepancies, which is a well-defined task.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, technical language with no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n4.  **Completeness/Consistency**: The parameters for both models are explicitly provided. The Logical Effort parameters ($g$, $p$, $\\tau$) form a self-contained set for its calculation. The parameters for the effective-current model ($V_{DD}$, $V_T$, $C_L$, $I_{\\text{ON,n}}$, $\\alpha$) are sufficient to analyze its behavior and justify the expected trends. There are no contradictions in the provided data.\n5.  **No other flaws detected**: The problem is not unrealistic, ill-posed, trivial, or unverifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The analysis will proceed.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\n\nThe problem requires us to calculate the propagation delay using two different models and compare the results, explaining any differences. The transition of interest is the output falling edge (high-to-low), which is caused by a rising input. This transition is governed by the n-channel MOSFET discharging the load capacitance $C_L$. Propagation delay ($t_{pHL}$) is defined as the time interval between the input crossing $50\\%$ of its final value ($V_{DD}/2$) and the output crossing $50\\%$ of its final value ($V_{DD}/2$).\n\n**1. Logical Effort Model Calculation**\n\nThe Logical Effort model provides a simplified, linear delay equation:\n$$T_d = \\tau (gh + p)$$\nwhere $g$ is the logical effort, $h$ is the electrical effort, $p$ is the parasitic delay, and $\\tau$ is the technology delay constant.\n\n- **Logical Effort ($g$)**: For a standard inverter, this is defined as $g=1$.\n- **Parasitic Delay ($p$)**: For a standard inverter, the normalized parasitic delay is given as $p=1$.\n- **Electrical Effort ($h$)**: This is the ratio of the load capacitance to the input capacitance of the gate.\n$$h = \\frac{C_{L}}{C_{\\text{in}}} = \\frac{20\\,\\text{fF}}{6\\,\\text{fF}} = \\frac{10}{3} \\approx 3.333$$\n- **Technology Constant ($\\tau$)**: This is given as $\\tau = 6.0\\,\\text{ps}$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the delay:\n$$T_{d,LE} = (6.0\\,\\text{ps}) \\left( (1) \\left(\\frac{10}{3}\\right) + 1 \\right) = (6.0\\,\\text{ps}) \\left(\\frac{10}{3} + \\frac{3}{3}\\right) = (6.0\\,\\text{ps}) \\left(\\frac{13}{3}\\right) = 2.0 \\times 13\\,\\text{ps} = 26.0\\,\\text{ps}$$\n\nA key characteristic of the basic Logical Effort model is that it is independent of the input signal's slew rate. Therefore, it predicts a delay of $26.0\\,\\text{ps}$ for both $t_{\\text{slew}} = 10\\,\\text{ps}$ and $t_{\\text{slew}} = 60\\,\\text{ps}$.\n\n**2. Effective-Current ($I_{\\text{eff}}$) Model Analysis**\n\nThis model aims to be more physically accurate by considering the time-varying nature of the transistor's drive current. The propagation delay for the falling transition can be approximated as the time it takes for an effective current $I_{\\text{eff}}$ to discharge the load capacitance $C_L$ by $V_{DD}/2$:\n$$t_{pHL} \\approx \\frac{C_L (V_{DD}/2)}{I_{\\text{eff}}}$$\nThe crucial part is determining $I_{\\text{eff}}$. Unlike the Logical Effort model, this approach accounts for the input slew rate, $t_{\\text{slew}}$.\n\n- **Effect of Input Slew**: The input voltage $V_{\\text{in}}(t)$ is a ramp. The nMOS transistor begins to conduct when $V_{\\text{in}}(t)$ crosses its threshold voltage, $V_{T,n} = 0.35\\,\\text{V}$. The nMOS current $I_D$, which discharges $C_L$, is a function of $V_{GS} = V_{\\text{in}}(t)$ according to the alpha-power law, $I_D \\propto (V_{\\text{in}}(t) - V_T)^\\alpha$.\n\n- **Fast Slew ($t_{\\text{slew}} = 10\\,\\text{ps}$)**: With a fast-rising input, the nMOS gate voltage $V_{GS}$ quickly reaches $V_{DD}$. The transistor provides a strong drive current for most of the output transition. The resulting delay should be close to the delay for an ideal step input. The Logical Effort model is typically calibrated for such typical/fast slew conditions, so we expect the effective-current model to yield a result close to the $26.0\\,\\text{ps}$ predicted by Logical Effort.\n\n- **Slow Slew ($t_{\\text{slew}} = 60\\,\\text{ps}$)**: With a slow-rising input, the nMOS gate voltage spends a significant amount of time at intermediate values between $V_T$ and $V_{DD}$. During this time, the transistor's drive current is significantly weaker than its maximum on-current. This lowers the *average* discharge current ($I_{\\text{eff}}$) over the entire transition. A lower $I_{\\text{eff}}$ results in a longer time to discharge $C_L$, thus increasing the propagation delay $t_{pHL}$.\n\nThe total delay in such a model can be conceptually broken into two parts: a base delay (similar to the step-response delay) and an additional delay component that is proportional to the input slew time, $t_{\\text{slew}}$. The reasoning for the latter is twofold:\n1.  There is a \"waiting\" period while the input ramps up to a voltage that can provide substantial current. Propagation delay is measured from $V_{\\text{in}} = V_{DD}/2 = 0.5\\,\\text{V}$. The nMOS turns on at $V_{in} = V_T = 0.35\\,\\text{V}$, so it is already on at the measurement start point. However, the current is still weak. The time the input spends ramping from $V_T$ to higher voltages contributes a delay term proportional to $t_{\\text{slew}}$.\n2.  The average current during the discharge event is reduced because the gate drive is not instantaneously at $V_{DD}$. This effect also increases delay in a manner dependent on $t_{\\text{slew}}$. The non-linearity of the current model ($\\alpha=1.3$) makes this dependency significant.\n\nTherefore, the effective-current model must predict a delay that increases with $t_{\\text{slew}}$. The delay for $t_{\\text{slew}} = 60\\,\\text{ps}$ will be significantly larger than for $t_{\\text{slew}} = 10\\,\\text{ps}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Logical Effort predicts approximately $26\\,\\text{ps}$ independent of input slew; the effective-current model predicts approximately $26.5\\,\\text{ps}$ for $t_{\\text{slew}} = 10\\,\\text{ps}$ and approximately $44\\,\\text{ps}$ for $t_{\\text{slew}} = 60\\,\\text{ps}$. The discrepancy is primarily due to a waiting time proportional to $t_{\\text{slew}}$ before the n-channel MOSFET turns on and to the nonlinear reduction of average discharge current during the transition.**\n- **LE Prediction**: The value of $\\approx 26\\,\\text{ps}$ and its independence from slew are correct, as calculated above.\n- **$I_{\\text{eff}}$ Prediction**: The values show the correct trend: the delay increases with slew ($26.5\\,\\text{ps} \\to 44\\,\\text{ps}$). For the fast slew ($10\\,\\text{ps}$), the delay ($26.5\\,\\text{ps}$) is very close to the LE prediction ($26.0\\,\\text{ps}$), which is consistent with the idea that LE is calibrated for fast inputs. The significant increase for the slow slew ($60\\,\\text{ps}$) is also physically correct. The numerical values are plausible for a more detailed physical model.\n- **Explanation**: The reasoning is physically sound. It correctly identifies the role of input slew in reducing the average drive current and creating a slew-dependent delay component. While the term \"waiting time ... before the n-channel MOSFET turns on\" is slightly imprecise (turn-on occurs at $V_T=0.35\\,\\text{V}$, before the $V_{DD}/2 = 0.5\\,\\text{V}$ measurement start), it correctly captures the essence of the delay caused by the input ramp. The \"nonlinear reduction of average discharge current\" is an accurate description of the core physical effect.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Logical Effort predicts a delay that increases linearly with $t_{\\text{slew}}$ because the logical effort $g$ depends on slew; the effective-current model predicts a constant delay near $26\\,\\text{ps}$. The discrepancy is due to Logical Effort overestimating the inverter parasitic capacitance.**\n- **LE Prediction**: This is fundamentally incorrect. The standard Logical Effort model is slew-independent. Logical effort $g$ is a property of the gate's topology and transistor sizing, not the input signal characteristics.\n- **$I_{\\text{eff}}$ Prediction**: This is also fundamentally incorrect. A primary purpose of effective-current models is to capture the dependency of delay on factors like input slew. It would not predict a constant delay.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Logical Effort predicts approximately $44\\,\\text{ps}$ for $t_{\\text{slew}} = 60\\,\\text{ps}$ because the electrical effort $h$ increases with slower slew; the effective-current model predicts approximately $26\\,\\text{ps}$ irrespective of slew. The discrepancy is due to Logical Effort ignoring the Miller effect entirely.**\n- **LE Prediction**: This is incorrect. The LE prediction is $26\\,\\text{ps}$, not $44\\,\\text{ps}$. The electrical effort $h=C_L/C_{in}$ is a ratio of capacitances and is independent of slew rate.\n- **$I_{\\text{eff}}$ Prediction**: This is incorrect for the same reason as in option B. It would not predict a constant delay.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Both methods predict identical delays of approximately $26\\,\\text{ps}$ for both slews because the alpha-power law average cancels slew dependence; any observed difference is a numerical artifact rather than a modeling limitation.**\n- **Prediction**: This is incorrect. The effective-current model must show a dependence on slew.\n- **Explanation**: The claim that averaging the alpha-power law current \"cancels slew dependence\" is false. The average effective current is lower for slower slews, which increases delay. The difference in delay for different slews is a real physical effect captured by better models, not a numerical artifact. The fact that the basic LE model ignores it is a known limitation of that model.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.",
