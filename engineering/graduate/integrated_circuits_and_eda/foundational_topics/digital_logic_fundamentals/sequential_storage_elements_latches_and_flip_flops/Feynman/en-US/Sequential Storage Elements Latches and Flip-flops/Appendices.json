            "problem": "Consider a bistable latch formed by two identical Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) inverters cross-coupled, powered by a direct-current supply of magnitude $V_{DD}$. Each inverter consists of a single-channel $n$-type Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (NMOS) pull-down and $p$-type Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (PMOS) pull-up device characterized in the strong-inversion region by the widely used $\\alpha$-power law, which captures velocity saturation and short-channel effects. Specifically, the drain current of the NMOS and PMOS when they are in saturation at a gate-source overdrive is given by\n$$\ni_{n} = k_{n} \\left(v - V_{Tn}\\right)^{\\alpha}, \\quad v \\geq V_{Tn},\n$$\n$$\ni_{p} = k_{p} \\left(V_{DD} - v - |V_{Tp}|\\right)^{\\alpha}, \\quad V_{DD} - v \\geq |V_{Tp}|,\n$$\nwhere $k_{n} > 0$ and $k_{p} > 0$ are technology- and size-dependent conduction coefficients proportional to $\\mu C_{\\text{ox}} W/L$ for the respective devices, $V_{Tn} > 0$ and $V_{Tp} < 0$ are threshold voltages, and $\\alpha \\in (1,2]$ is the velocity-saturation exponent. Assume quasi-static direct-current operation and that, near the inverter’s switching point, both devices are in saturation so that the above expressions are valid.\n\nDefine the static noise margin (SNM) as the side length of the largest axis-aligned square that can be inscribed between the direct-current voltage transfer characteristic $v_{o} = g(v_{i})$ of one inverter and the reflection of the other inverter’s characteristic through the line $v_{o} = v_{i}$ (the so-called butterfly plot). Starting from the definitions of fixed points and their stability for the cross-coupled composition $v = g(g(v))$, and from the $\\alpha$-power law currents and direct-current equilibrium condition $i_{n} = i_{p}$ at the inverter’s switching point, derive the sizing condition on the ratio of pull-up to pull-down strengths that maximizes the SNM while preserving bistability. Your derivation must explicitly justify why the symmetry of the two inverter characteristics around the point $(V_{DD}/2, V_{DD}/2)$ is preferred for maximizing SNM, and why the resulting latch remains bistable under that condition.\n\nExpress your final answer as a single closed-form analytic expression for the optimal ratio $k_{n}/k_{p}$ in terms of $V_{DD}$, $V_{Tn}$, $|V_{Tp}|$, and $\\alpha$. No numerical evaluation is required.",
            "solution": "The cross-coupled CMOS latch implements positive feedback between two identical inverters. Let the direct-current voltage transfer characteristic (VTC) of a single inverter be denoted $v_{o} = g(v_{i})$, where $g$ is a strictly decreasing, continuous function mapping $[0,V_{DD}]$ to $[V_{DD},0]$. The fixed points of the cross-coupled system satisfy $v = g(g(v))$. Stability at a fixed point $v^{\\star}$ is determined by the magnitude of the derivative of the composed mapping:\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{d}{dv} \\left[g\\!\\left(g(v)\\right)\\right]\\bigg|_{v=v^{\\star}}\\right| = \\left|g'\\!\\left(g(v^{\\star})\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\left|g'(v^{\\star})\\right|.\n$$\nFor identical inverters, $g(v^{\\star}) = v^{\\star}$ at a symmetric fixed point and thus the stability condition simplifies to $\\left|g'(v^{\\star})\\right|^{2} < 1$ for stability and $\\left|g'(v^{\\star})\\right|^{2} > 1$ for instability. The latch exhibits bistability when there exist two stable fixed points near the rails and one unstable fixed point near the center; the unstable central fixed point ensures the existence of two distinct basins of attraction.\n\nThe static noise margin (SNM) is geometrically defined on the butterfly plot formed by the VTC $v_{o}=g(v_{i})$ and its reflection $v_{i}=g(v_{o})$. The largest axis-aligned square that can be inscribed between these two curves has its sides parallel to the axes, and its side length is constrained by the minimum separation between the two curves measured along either axis. For two identical inverters, the butterfly plot is symmetric with respect to the line $v_{o}=v_{i}$ and the two lobes correspond to the low and high stable states. Let $V_{M}$ denote the inverter’s switching point, defined as the solution to $g(V_{M}) = V_{M}$, equivalently the point where input equals output.\n\nA robust way to see why symmetry about $(V_{DD}/2,V_{DD}/2)$ maximizes SNM is the following minimax argument. Consider the distances from $V_{M}$ to the supply rails along the input axis: the low-side headroom $d_{L} = V_{M}$ and high-side headroom $d_{H} = V_{DD} - V_{M}$. For an axis-aligned inscribed square, the limiting side length is determined by the smaller of the two lobes, which in turn is limited by the smaller headroom between the switching point and the respective rail after accounting for the local gain. In the first-order approximation near $V_{M}$, model the VTC locally as a straight line with slope $-m$, $m = -g'(V_{M}) > 0$, crossing the point $(V_{M},V_{M})$:\n$$\nv_{o} \\approx V_{M} - m\\,(v_{i} - V_{M}).\n$$\nThe reflected characteristic is $v_{i} \\approx V_{M} - m\\,(v_{o} - V_{M})$. Under this linear approximation, the limiting separation that sets the square side is proportional to the smaller of $d_{L}$ and $d_{H}$, scaled by a function of $m$ that is monotone increasing in $m$ for $m > 1$ (the regime that yields an unstable central fixed point, since $\\left|g'(V_{M})\\right|^{2} = m^{2} > 1$). Therefore, for fixed $m$ the SNM is maximized when $d_{L} = d_{H}$, i.e., when $V_{M} = V_{DD}/2$, because this balances the two lobes and increases the minimum separation in the minimax sense. This symmetry condition about $(V_{DD}/2,V_{DD}/2)$ ensures that the butterfly plot is mirror-symmetric with equal lobe sizes, which maximizes the largest inscribed square. This is the geometric reason symmetry is preferred. From the stability viewpoint, choosing device sizes to center $V_{M}$ does not, by itself, reduce $m$; typical inverter designs yield $m > 1$ near the switching point. Thus bistability is preserved because the central fixed point remains unstable ($m^{2} > 1$), while the two near-rail fixed points have composite slope magnitude less than $1$.\n\nWe now determine the sizing condition that places $V_{M}$ at $V_{DD}/2$. At the inverter switching point, the NMOS and PMOS carry equal current under direct-current equilibrium:\n$$\ni_{n}(V_{M}) = i_{p}(V_{M}).\n$$\nUnder the $\\alpha$-power law saturation model, this becomes\n$$\nk_{n} \\left(V_{M} - V_{Tn}\\right)^{\\alpha} = k_{p} \\left(V_{DD} - V_{M} - |V_{Tp}|\\right)^{\\alpha}.\n$$\nSolving for the ratio of strengths yields\n$$\n\\frac{k_{n}}{k_{p}} = \\left(\\frac{V_{DD} - V_{M} - |V_{Tp}|}{V_{M} - V_{Tn}}\\right)^{\\alpha}.\n$$\nImposing the symmetry condition $V_{M} = V_{DD}/2$ that maximizes the static noise margin gives the optimal ratio\n$$\n\\frac{k_{n}}{k_{p}} = \\left(\\frac{\\frac{V_{DD}}{2} - |V_{Tp}|}{\\frac{V_{DD}}{2} - V_{Tn}}\\right)^{\\alpha}.\n$$\n\nFinally, we comment on bistability under this condition. The local direct-current gain magnitude $m = -g'(V_{M})$ depends on the transconductances of the devices and the output resistance at $V_{M}$; for typical short-channel CMOS inverters sized per the above condition, $m > 1$ holds, so the central fixed point is unstable because $\\left|g'(V_{M})\\right|^{2} = m^{2} > 1$, and the two near-rail fixed points are stable due to the much smaller local gain magnitudes there. Thus, the latch remains bistable while the SNM is maximized. Symmetry is preferred not only because it maximizes SNM in the minimax sense but also because it equalizes margins for the two logic states, reduces sensitivity to systematic mismatches, and simplifies robust sizing across process, voltage, and temperature variations.\n\nTherefore, the condition on device sizing that maximizes static noise margin while preserving bistability is to choose the pull-up to pull-down strength ratio so that the inverter switching point is centered, yielding the closed-form expression for the optimal ratio $k_{n}/k_{p}$ as above.",

The use of linearization to study local stability around an equilibrium point is a fundamental technique in physics and engineering.

The deviation is defined as $\\delta(t) = V(t) - V_{M}$, which implies $V(t) = V_{M} + \\delta(t)$. Since $V_{M}$ is a constant, the time derivative of $V(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dV(t)}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(V_{M} + \\delta(t)) = \\frac{d\\delta(t)}{dt}\n$$\nNext, we perform a first-order Taylor series expansion of the nonlinear function $f(V(t))$ around the point $V_{M}$:\n$$\nf(V(t)) = f(V_{M} + \\delta(t)) \\approx f(V_{M}) + f'(V_{M}) \\delta(t)\n$$\nThis approximation is valid for small $\\delta(t)$, which defines the small-signal regime.\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $V(t)$, $\\frac{dV(t)}{dt}$, and the linearized $f(V(t))$ back into the original dynamic equation:\n$$\n\\tau \\frac{d\\delta(t)}{dt} \\approx -(V_{M} + \\delta(t)) + \\left( f(V_{M}) + f'(V_{M}) \\delta(t) \\right)\n$$\nBy definition of the equilibrium point, we have $f(V_{M}) = V_{M}$. Substituting this condition into the equation simplifies it:\n$$\n\\tau \\frac{d\\delta(t)}{dt} = -V_{M} - \\delta(t) + V_{M} + f'(V_{M}) \\delta(t)\n$$\nThe constant terms $-V_{M}$ and $+V_{M}$ cancel, yielding the linearized small-signal dynamic equation for the deviation $\\delta(t)$:\n$$\n\\tau \\frac{d\\delta(t)}{dt} = (f'(V_{M}) - 1) \\delta(t)\n$$\nThis first-order linear homogeneous ODE governs the evolution of small perturbations around the metastable point.\n\nTo demonstrate the condition for instability, we rearrange the equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\delta(t)}{dt} = \\frac{f'(V_{M}) - 1}{\\tau} \\delta(t)\n$$\nThis is an equation of the form $\\frac{dy}{dt} = ky$, whose solution is an exponential function $y(t) = y(0) \\exp(kt)$. The equilibrium at $\\delta(t) = 0$ is unstable if any non-zero perturbation $\\delta(0)$ grows with time. This occurs if the coefficient of $\\delta(t)$ is positive:\n$$\n\\frac{f'(V_{M}) - 1}{\\tau} > 0\n$$\nGiven that the time constant $\\tau$ is strictly positive ($\\tau > 0$), the condition for instability simplifies to:\n$$\nf'(V_{M}) - 1 > 0 \\implies f'(V_{M}) > 1\n$$\nThis confirms that the metastable point is unstable if the small-signal loop gain $f'(V_{M})$ is greater than unity, causing any small deviation to be amplified exponentially.\n\nFinally, we solve the ODE to find the explicit closed-form expression for $\\delta(t)$. The ODE is separable:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\delta}{\\delta} = \\frac{f'(V_{M}) - 1}{\\tau} dt\n$$\nIntegrating both sides from an initial time $t=0$ to a general time $t$, and from the initial deviation $\\delta(0)$ to $\\delta(t)$:\n$$\n\\int_{\\delta(0)}^{\\delta(t)} \\frac{1}{\\delta'} d\\delta' = \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{f'(V_{M}) - 1}{\\tau} dt'\n$$\n$$\n\\ln|\\delta'| \\bigg|_{\\delta(0)}^{\\delta(t)} = \\frac{f'(V_{M}) - 1}{\\tau} [t']_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln|\\delta(t)| - \\ln|\\delta(0)| = \\frac{f'(V_{M}) - 1}{\\tau} t\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{|\\delta(t)|}{|\\delta(0)|}\\right) = \\frac{f'(V_{M}) - 1}{\\tau} t\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives:\n$$\n\\frac{|\\delta(t)|}{|\\delta(0)|} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{f'(V_{M}) - 1}{\\tau} t\\right)\n$$\nAssuming the deviation $\\delta(t)$ does not change sign from its initial value $\\delta(0)$ (which is true for this exponential growth/decay model), we can remove the absolute value signs. Thus, the explicit closed-form expression for $\\delta(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\delta(t) = \\delta(0) \\exp\\left(\\frac{f'(V_{M}) - 1}{\\tau} t\\right)\n$$\nThis expression describes how a small initial perturbation $\\delta(0)$ from the metastable point evolves over time.",

We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe MTBF is the reciprocal of the failure rate, $R_{\\text{failure}}$.\n$$\n\\text{MTBF} = \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{failure}}}\n$$\nThe failure rate is the product of the rate at which metastability-inducing events occur, $R_{\\text{event}}$, and the probability that such an event results in a synchronizer failure, $P_{\\text{failure}}$.\n$$\nR_{\\text{failure}} = R_{\\text{event}} \\cdot P_{\\text{failure}}\n$$\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for $R_{\\text{event}}$. A metastability-inducing event occurs when the asynchronous data signal changes its value within the critical timing window (aperture window) of the first flip-flop. This window has a duration $T_0$. The problem states that the rate of these events is proportional to $f_{\\text{data}} f_{\\text{clk}} T_0$. The standard model, which we adopt here, sets the proportionality constant to $1$. This model arises from considering that data transitions occur at a rate $f_{\\text{data}}$ and the fraction of time the circuit is vulnerable around each clock edge is $T_0/T_{clk} = T_0 f_{clk}$. However, a more direct physical argument is that data transitions occur at a rate of $f_{\\text{data}}$, and each transition has a probability $T_0 f_{\\text{clk}}$ of landing in a vulnerable window. Thus, the rate of coincidence is $R_{\\text{event}} = f_{\\text{data}} f_{\\text{clk}} T_0$.

This means the synchronizer is expected to fail on average more than $100$ times per second. For any practical application, this is a catastrophic failure rate. A high-reliability system, with a mission duration of many years, must have an extremely low probability of failure. This requires an MTBF that is many orders of magnitude larger than the mission duration, typically measured in millions or billions of years.\nThe computed MTBF is therefore completely inadequate. The primary cause for this poor performance is the small available resolution time, $T_{\\text{res}} = 200$ ps. The ratio $T_{\\text{res}}/\\tau = 10$ is insufficient to suppress the probability of unresolved metastability to an acceptable level. A robust synchronizer design would ensure $T_{\\text{res}}$ is a much larger multiple of $\\tau$. Typically, $T_{\\text{res}}$ is close to one full clock period (which is $1/(500 \\text{ MHz}) = 2000$ ps in this case), which would yield a ratio $T_{\\text{res}}/\\tau \\approx 100$ and a resulting MTBF that is astronomically large and acceptable for high-reliability applications.",
