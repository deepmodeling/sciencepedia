            "problem": "In the context of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) for integrated circuits, consider an incompletely specified Boolean function $f:\\{0,1\\}^4 \\to \\{0,1\\}$ of variables $x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4$. The function is specified by its on-set $\\mathcal{F}$, off-set $\\mathcal{R}$, and don't-care set $\\mathcal{D}$ over minterms indexed by the conventional binary-to-integer mapping $m = 8x_1 + 4x_2 + 2x_3 + x_4$. The sets are:\n$\\mathcal{F} = \\{m_0, m_1, m_2, m_5, m_8, m_9, m_{10}, m_{13}\\}$,\n$\\mathcal{D} = \\{m_3, m_{11}, m_{15}\\}$,\n$\\mathcal{R} = \\{m_4, m_6, m_7, m_{12}, m_{14}\\}$.\nStarting from the foundational definitions of incompletely specified Boolean functions, implicants, prime implicants, and the duality between sum of products (SOP) and product of sums (POS), derive a minimal SOP and a minimal POS for $f$ by strategically using the set $\\mathcal{D}$ to minimize the forms without covering any elements of $\\mathcal{R}$. For literal counting, define the SOP literal count $L_{\\mathrm{SOP}}$ as the total number of literal occurrences across all product terms in the SOP, and the POS literal count $L_{\\mathrm{POS}}$ as the total number of literal occurrences across all sum clauses in the POS. Here, each occurrence of a variable in complemented or uncomplemented form contributes one literal. Compute the difference $\\Delta = L_{\\mathrm{POS}} - L_{\\mathrm{SOP}}$. Express the final answer as a single real-valued number. No rounding is required and no units are involved.",
            "solution": "We begin from the definitions: an incompletely specified Boolean function assigns output $1$ to minterms in the on-set $\\mathcal{F}$, output $0$ to minterms in the off-set $\\mathcal{R}$, and allows arbitrary assignment (either $0$ or $1$) to minterms in the don't-care set $\\mathcal{D}$. In minimization, an implicant for the SOP of $f$ may cover minterms in $\\mathcal{F}$ and $\\mathcal{D}$ but must not cover any minterm in $\\mathcal{R}$; for the SOP of $\\overline{f}$, an implicant may cover minterms in $\\mathcal{R}$ and $\\mathcal{D}$ but must not cover any minterm in $\\mathcal{F}$. A prime implicant is an implicant that cannot be enlarged (by dropping literals) without covering a minterm outside the permissible sets. The duality between SOP and POS is given by De Morgan’s laws and distributivity in Boolean algebra.\n\nStep $1$: Identify structural regularities in $\\mathcal{F}$ enabling large implicants in SOP for $f$. Enumerate the minterms in $\\mathcal{F}$ and $\\mathcal{D}$ with their bit patterns $(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)$:\n$m_0=(0,0,0,0)$, $m_1=(0,0,0,1)$, $m_2=(0,0,1,0)$, $m_5=(0,1,0,1)$, $m_8=(1,0,0,0)$, $m_9=(1,0,0,1)$, $m_{10}=(1,0,1,0)$, $m_{13}=(1,1,0,1)$, and $\\mathcal{D}$ has $m_3=(0,0,1,1)$, $m_{11}=(1,0,1,1)$, $m_{15}=(1,1,1,1)$.\n\nObserve that all minterms with $x_2=0$ are either in $\\mathcal{F}$ or $\\mathcal{D}$: the set $\\{m_0,m_1,m_2,m_3,m_8,m_9,m_{10},m_{11}\\}$ corresponds to $x_2=0$ for all $(x_1,x_3,x_4)$ combinations. None of these is in $\\mathcal{R}$ because every $m \\in \\mathcal{R}$ listed has $x_2=1$. Therefore, the implicant $\\overline{x_2}$ (a single-literal implicant fixing $x_2 = 0$) is valid, covers $m_0,m_1,m_2,m_8,m_9,m_{10}$ in $\\mathcal{F}$ and uses $m_3,m_{11}$ from $\\mathcal{D}$ to expand the implicant to its maximal extent as a prime implicant.\n\nStep $2$: Cover the remaining on-set minterms $m_5=(0,1,0,1)$ and $m_{13}=(1,1,0,1)$, which are not covered by $\\overline{x_2}$. These two differ only in $x_1$, and share $x_2=1$, $x_3=0$, $x_4=1$, so they form an implicant $x_2 \\overline{x_3} x_4$. This implicant does not cover any minterm in $\\mathcal{R}$.\n\nStep $3$: Reduce the SOP via absorption. Using the Boolean algebra identity $A + \\overline{A}B = A+B$, we can simplify the expression. Here, let $A = \\overline{x_3} x_4$ and $B = x_2$. The full SOP would be $\\overline{x_2} + x_2 \\overline{x_3} x_4$. Applying the identity, we get:\n$\\overline{x_2} + x_2 (\\overline{x_3} x_4) = \\overline{x_2} + \\overline{x_3} x_4$.\nThis simplification is valid because $(\\overline{x_2} + \\overline{x_3} x_4)(\\overline{x_2} + x_2) = (\\overline{x_2} + \\overline{x_3} x_4) \\cdot 1 = \\overline{x_2} + \\overline{x_3} x_4$.\nTherefore, a minimal SOP is\n$f_{\\mathrm{SOP}} = \\overline{x_2} + \\overline{x_3} x_4$.\n\nStep $4$: Derive a minimal POS via duality. We minimize the SOP of the complement $\\overline{f}$ by covering the off-set $\\mathcal{R}$ using the don't-cares $\\mathcal{D}$, while avoiding the on-set $\\mathcal{F}$. The minterms for $\\overline{f}$ are $\\mathcal{R} \\cup \\mathcal{D} = \\{m_3, m_4, m_6, m_7, m_{11}, m_{12}, m_{14}, m_{15}\\}$. The off-set minterms are $m_4=(0,1,0,0)$, $m_6=(0,1,1,0)$, $m_7=(0,1,1,1)$, $m_{12}=(1,1,0,0)$, $m_{14}=(1,1,1,0)$. We identify two large implicants for $\\overline{f}$:\n- $x_2 \\overline{x_4}$ covers $\\{m_4,m_6,m_{12},m_{14}\\}$, all in $\\mathcal{R}$, and does not intersect $\\mathcal{F}$.\n- $x_2 x_3$ covers $\\{m_6,m_7,m_{14},m_{15}\\}$, with $\\{m_6,m_7,m_{14}\\} \\subset \\mathcal{R}$ and $m_{15} \\in \\mathcal{D}$, and does not intersect $\\mathcal{F}$.\nThese two implicants cover all of $\\mathcal{R}$. Hence a minimal SOP for $\\overline{f}$ is\n$\\overline{f}_{\\mathrm{SOP}} = x_2 \\overline{x_4} + x_2 x_3$.\nBy De Morgan’s laws,\n$f = \\overline{(\\overline{f})} = \\overline{(x_2 \\overline{x_4} + x_2 x_3)} = \\overline{(x_2 \\overline{x_4})} \\cdot \\overline{(x_2 x_3)} = (\\overline{x_2} + x_4) \\cdot (\\overline{x_2} + \\overline{x_3})$,\ngiving a POS\n$f_{\\mathrm{POS}} = (\\overline{x_2} + x_4)(\\overline{x_2} + \\overline{x_3})$.\nWe can verify the equivalence using the distributive law $A + BC = (A + B)(A + C)$. Taking $A = \\overline{x_2}$, $B = \\overline{x_3}$, $C = x_4$, we transform $\\overline{x_2} + \\overline{x_3} x_4$ into $(\\overline{x_2} + \\overline{x_3})(\\overline{x_2} + x_4)$, matching the derived POS.\n\nStep $5$: Compute literal counts. For SOP, $f_{\\mathrm{SOP}} = \\overline{x_2} + \\overline{x_3} x_4$ comprises one term with $1$ literal and one term with $2$ literals, so\n$L_{\\mathrm{SOP}} = 1 + 2 = 3$.\nFor POS, $f_{\\mathrm{POS}} = (\\overline{x_2} + x_4)(\\overline{x_2} + \\overline{x_3})$ comprises two clauses each with $2$ literals, so\n$L_{\\mathrm{POS}} = 2 + 2 = 4$.\nTherefore, the requested difference is\n$\\Delta = L_{\\mathrm{POS}} - L_{\\mathrm{SOP}} = 4 - 3 = 1$.",

You will navigate practical constraints such as limited fan-in and the need to explicitly generate inverted signals, culminating in a proof of your implementation's minimality in terms of gate count.",

Prove that your gate count is minimal under the stated constraints. Provide your final answer as a single integer equal to the minimum number of two-input $\\mathrm{NAND}$ gates required. No rounding is needed, and no units are required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the synthesis of a Boolean function $f(x,y,z)$ using the minimum number of two-input $\\mathrm{NAND}$ gates, subject to specific constraints. The function is defined by a truth table. The synthesis process will begin by finding a minimal Boolean expression for $f$, followed by its implementation using only two-input $\\mathrm{NAND}$ gates, while adhering to all stated constraints. Finally, the minimality of the resulting implementation must be formally proven.\n\nFirst, we formalize the problem by deriving a Boolean expression for $f(x,y,z)$ from the provided truth table. The function's output is $1$ for the following input combinations (minterms):\n- $(x,y,z) = (0,0,1)$, which corresponds to the minterm $\\bar{x}\\bar{y}z$.\n- $(x,y,z) = (0,1,1)$, which corresponds to the minterm $\\bar{x}yz$.\n- $(x,y,z) = (1,1,0)$, which corresponds to the minterm $xy\\bar{z}$.\n- $(x,y,z) = (1,1,1)$, which corresponds to the minterm $xyz$.\n\nThe Sum-of-Products (SOP) expression for $f$ is the logical sum of these minterms:\n$$f(x,y,z) = \\bar{x}\\bar{y}z + \\bar{x}yz + xy\\bar{z} + xyz$$\nTo find a minimal SOP expression, we can use the postulates of Boolean algebra, specifically the adjacency property ($ab+a\\bar{b}=a$). A systematic way to apply this is through a Karnaugh map. The K-map for $f(x,y,z)$ is:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n\\large{f} & yz=00 & yz=01 & yz=11 & yz=10 \\\\\n\\hline\nx=0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\nx=1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\nWe group the adjacent $1$s to simplify the expression.\n1. The two $1$s in the row $x=0$ at columns $yz=01$ and $yz=11$ can be grouped. This corresponds to $(\\bar{x}\\bar{y}z + \\bar{x}yz)$, which simplifies to $\\bar{x}z(\\bar{y}+y) = \\bar{x}z$.\n2. The two $1$s in the row $x=1$ at columns $yz=11$ and $yz=10$ can be grouped. This corresponds to $(xyz + xy\\bar{z})$, which simplifies to $xy(z+\\bar{z}) = xy$.\n\nThese two groups cover all the minterms for which $f=1$. Thus, the minimal Sum-of-Products expression for the function is:\n$$f(x,y,z) = xy + \\bar{x}z$$\n\nNext, we must implement this expression using only two-input $\\mathrm{NAND}$ gates. A two-level SOP expression can be directly converted to a two-level $\\mathrm{NAND}$-$\\mathrm{NAND}$ implementation. We use the property of involution ($a=\\overline{\\overline{a}}$) and De Morgan's laws ($(a+b)'=\\bar{a}\\bar{b}$):\n$$f = xy + \\bar{x}z = \\overline{\\overline{(xy + \\bar{x}z)}} = \\overline{(\\overline{xy}) \\cdot (\\overline{\\bar{x}z})}$$\nThis expression can be implemented with three $\\mathrm{NAND}$ gates, assuming inputs $x$, $y$, $z$, and $\\bar{x}$ are available. However, the problem states two critical constraints:\n1. Primary inputs are available only in their uncomplemented form ($x, y, z$).\n2. Any logical inversion must be realized using a two-input $\\mathrm{NAND}$ gate with its inputs shorted, e.g., $\\bar{x} = \\mathrm{NAND}(x,x)$.\n\nOur expression requires the complemented input $\\bar{x}$. Therefore, we must explicitly generate $\\bar{x}$ from $x$ using one $\\mathrm{NAND}$ gate. The complete implementation is as follows:\n- Gate 1: $g_1 = \\mathrm{NAND}(x, x) = \\bar{x}$\n- Gate 2: $g_2 = \\mathrm{NAND}(x, y) = \\overline{xy}$\n- Gate 3: $g_3 = \\mathrm{NAND}(g_1, z) = \\mathrm{NAND}(\\bar{x}, z) = \\overline{\\bar{x}z}$\n- Gate 4: $f = \\mathrm{NAND}(g_2, g_3) = \\mathrm{NAND}(\\overline{xy}, \\overline{\\bar{x}z}) = xy + \\bar{x}z$\n\nThis implementation uses a total of four two-input $\\mathrm{NAND}$ gates.\n\nThe final step is to prove that this four-gate solution is minimal.\n1. The minimal SOP expression $f = xy + \\bar{x}z$ and the minimal Product-of-Sums (POS) expression $f = (x+z)(\\bar{x}+y)$ both require the literal $\\bar{x}$. Since only uncomplemented inputs are provided, at least one gate must be used as an inverter to generate $\\bar{x} = \\mathrm{NAND}(x,x)$. This establishes a necessary cost of one gate.\n\n2. Let us analyze the function that remains to be implemented, $g = xy + \\bar{x}z$, assuming $x, y, z,$ and $\\bar{x}$ are available as inputs. We need to determine the minimum number of $\\mathrm{NAND}$ gates to implement $g$.\n   - A single $\\mathrm{NAND}$ gate can only realize functions of the form $\\overline{ab}$. The function $g$ is a sum of products and is not equivalent to $\\overline{ab}$.\n   - Can $g$ be implemented with two $\\mathrm{NAND}$ gates? A two-gate $\\mathrm{NAND}$ circuit can realize functions of the form $h_1 = \\mathrm{NAND}(a, \\mathrm{NAND}(b,c)) = \\overline{a(\\overline{bc})} = \\bar{a}+bc$ or $h_2 = \\mathrm{NAND}(\\mathrm{NAND}(a,b), c) = \\overline{(\\overline{ab})c} = ab+\\bar{c}$. We need to check if $g=xy+\\bar{x}z$ can match either of these forms for some assignment of inputs $\\{x,y,z,\\bar{x}\\}$ to $\\{a,b,c\\}$.\n     - Matching $g$ with $h_1=\\bar{a}+bc$: This would require $\\bar{a}+bc = xy+\\bar{x}z$. This cannot be satisfied by assigning primary inputs to $a, b, c$ because the terms $xy$ and $\\bar{x}z$ are not separable into a single literal plus a product of two others. For example, using the property $A+\\bar{A}B=A+B$, we have $xy+\\bar{x}z = y+\\bar{x}z$. So we would need $\\bar{a}+bc = y+\\bar{x}z$. This implies $bc$ must equal $y$ and introduce the $\\bar{x}z$ term, which is impossible.\n     - Matching $g$ with $h_2=ab+\\bar{c}$: We need $ab+\\bar{c} = xy+\\bar{x}z$. This form has two product terms, but one is a single complemented literal. For $ab+\\bar{c}$ to match $xy+\\bar{x}z$, the terms must be equivalent. This is not possible as $xy$ and $\\bar{x}z$ are both products of two literals.\n\n3. Since $g$ cannot be implemented with one or two $\\mathrm{NAND}$ gates (given the available inputs), it requires a minimum of three $\\mathrm{NAND}$ gates. Our implementation $g = \\mathrm{NAND}(\\mathrm{NAND}(x, y), \\mathrm{NAND}(\\bar{x}, z))$ uses exactly three gates.\n\n4. Therefore, the minimum total number of gates is the sum of the minimum gates for the inverter and the minimum gates for the remaining logic: $1$ (for $\\bar{x}$) + $3$ (for $xy+\\bar{x}z$) = $4$.\n\nOur constructed circuit uses four gates, which matches this proven lower bound. Thus, the implementation is minimal.",

The critical path is the sum of the delays of these two stages.\n\n*   **AND Plane Delay:** The minimal SOP form of the parity function consists of its minterms. Each minterm is a product of 64 literals.

For $n=64$, the number of minterms to be ORed together is $M = 2^{64-1} = 2^{63}$. The OR plane is a balanced binary tree of 2-input $\\lor$ gates with $2^{63}$ inputs.
