There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of scientific principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of Diffusion Capacitance ($C_d$)**\n\nThe small-signal diffusion capacitance, $C_d$, arises from the variation of stored minority-carrier charge in the quasi-neutral regions of the diode with respect to the applied forward-bias voltage. By definition, capacitance is the rate of change of charge with respect to voltage:\n$$\nC_d = \\frac{dQ}{dV}\n$$\nwhere $Q$ is the total excess minority-carrier charge stored in the diode and $V$ is the forward-bias voltage across the junction.\n\nIn the quasi-static approximation, the total stored minority-carrier charge $Q$ is directly proportional to the DC forward current $I$ flowing through the diode. The constant of proportionality is the mean minority-carrier transit time, $\\tau_T$:\n$$\nQ = \\tau_T I\n$$\nSubstituting this relationship into the definition of $C_d$:\n$$\nC_d = \\frac{d}{dV}(\\tau_T I)\n$$\nSince $\\tau_T$ is a characteristic time of the device, treated as a constant for a given operating point, we can write:\n$$\nC_d = \\tau_T \\frac{dI}{dV}\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{dI}{dV}$ is the small-signal conductance of the diode, often denoted $g_d$.\n\nThe problem states to use the exponential current-voltage relationship for a forward-biased diode. This relationship is given by the Shockley diode equation:\n$$\nI = I_S \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{V}{nV_T}\\right) - 1 \\right)\n$$\nwhere $I_S$ is the reverse saturation current and $n$ is the ideality factor (typically between $1$ and $2$). For a silicon diode under strong forward bias ($V \\gg nV_T$), the '$-1$' term is negligible, and the ideality factor $n$ is often assumed to be $1$ for diffusion current dominance. Thus, the equation simplifies to:\n$$\nI \\approx I_S \\exp\\left(\\frac{V}{V_T}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we compute the derivative $\\frac{dI}{dV}$:\n$$\ng_d = \\frac{dI}{dV} = \\frac{d}{dV} \\left( I_S \\exp\\left(\\frac{V}{V_T}\\right) \\right) = I_S \\left( \\frac{1}{V_T} \\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{V}{V_T}\\right)\n$$\nBy substituting $I_S \\exp(V/V_T)$ with $I$, we get:\n$$\ng_d = \\frac{I}{V_T}\n$$\nFinally, substituting this expression for the conductance back into the equation for $C_d$, we obtain the general expression for the diffusion capacitance:\n$$\nC_d = \\tau_T \\frac{I}{V_T}\n$$\nThis expression relates the diffusion capacitance directly to the operating current $I$, the transit time $\\tau_T$, and the thermal voltage $V_T$.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\n\nFirst, we calculate the thermal voltage $V_T$ at $T = 300\\ \\text{K}$.

This phenomenon is known as conductivity modulation. The resistance of a slab is given by $R = \\rho \\frac{L}{A} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma} \\frac{L}{A}$, where $\\rho$ is the resistivity. A significant increase in conductivity $\\sigma$ leads to a correspondingly significant decrease in resistivity $\\rho$ and thus in the series resistance contributed by this quasi-neutral region. In a forward-biased diode, the total voltage drop includes a term $I R_{s}$ due to the total series resistance $R_s$. At low currents (low injection), the resistance of the $p$-side is relatively high. At high currents (high injection), conductivity modulation reduces this portion of the series resistance. This effect prevents the $I R_{s}$ drop from growing as fast as it would with a constant resistance, allowing the diode to conduct higher currents more efficiently. The forward $I$-$V$ characteristic, therefore, deviates less from the ideal exponential behavior at high current densities than it would in the absence of conductivity modulation.",

The solution process will proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe analysis is based on the charge-control model for a $p$-$n$ junction. The central equation relates the time rate of change of the total excess minority carrier charge stored in the quasi-neutral regions, $Q(t)$, to the diode current, $i(t)$, and the recombination rate. The general charge-control equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dQ(t)}{dt} = i(t) - \\frac{Q(t)}{\\tau_T}\n$$\nwhere $\\frac{Q(t)}{\\tau_T}$ represents the recombination current.\n\n**Phase 1: Steady-State Forward Bias ($t < 0$)**\nFor $t < 0$, the diode is in a steady state with a constant forward current $I_F$. In steady state, the stored charge is constant, so $\\frac{dQ}{dt} = 0$. The diode current is $i(t) = I_F$. The charge-control equation simplifies to:\n$$\n0 = I_F - \\frac{Q_F}{\\tau_T}\n$$\nHere, $Q_F$ is the steady-state stored charge. Solving for $Q_F$ gives the initial stored charge at the moment of switching, $t=0$:\n$$\nQ(0) = Q_F = I_F \\tau_T\n$$\n\n**Phase 2: Reverse Recovery Transient ($t > 0$)**\nAt $t=0$, the current source is switched to provide a constant reverse current $I_R$. The problem explicitly states to model this phase with two key assumptions:\n1. The rate of charge removal is limited by the reverse current, $I_R$.\n2. Recombination is negligible during this interval.\n\nThe second assumption means the recombination term $\\frac{Q(t)}{\\tau_T}$ in the charge-control equation is set to zero for $t > 0$. The equation thus simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{dQ(t)}{dt} = i(t)\n$$\nDuring this phase, the current flowing is the constant reverse current $i(t) = I_R$. So, the rate of change of stored charge is:\n$$\n\\frac{dQ(t)}{dt} = I_R\n$$\nSince $I_R$ is a negative value, this equation correctly describes a decrease in the stored charge $Q(t)$ over time.\n\n**Derivation of Reverse-Recovery Time ($t_{rr}$)**\nThe reverse-recovery period ends at time $t_{rr}$ when all the excess stored charge has been removed, i.e., $Q(t_{rr}) = 0$. To find $t_{rr}$, we integrate the simplified differential equation from $t=0$ to $t=t_{rr}$:\n$$\n\\int_{Q(0)}^{Q(t_{rr})} dQ = \\int_{0}^{t_{rr}} I_R \\, dt\n$$\nUsing the initial and final conditions for the charge, $Q(0) = I_F \\tau_T$ and $Q(t_{rr}) = 0$:\n$$\nQ(t_{rr}) - Q(0) = I_R (t_{rr} - 0)\n$$\n$$\n0 - I_F \\tau_T = I_R t_{rr}\n$$\nSolving for $t_{rr}$:\n$$\nt_{rr} = -\\frac{I_F \\tau_T}{I_R}\n$$\nSince $I_R$ is a negative current, it is conventional to express the result in terms of its magnitude, $|I_R| = -I_R$.\n$$\nt_{rr} = \\frac{I_F \\tau_T}{|I_R|}\n$$\n\n**Derivation of Reverse-Recovered Charge ($Q_{rr}$)**\nThe reverse-recovered charge, $Q_{rr}$, is defined as the total charge that flows out of the diode during the reverse-recovery time $t_{rr}$. Since the current is constant at $I_R$ during this interval, the magnitude of the charge that flows is the product of the magnitude of the current and the duration:\n$$\nQ_{rr} = |I_R| \\times t_{rr}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $t_{rr}$:\n$$\nQ_{rr} = |I_R| \\left( \\frac{I_F \\tau_T}{|I_R|} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nQ_{rr} = I_F \\tau_T\n$$\nThis result is physically intuitive under the problem's assumption that recombination is negligible during the sweep-out phase. It means that all the charge initially stored, $Q_F = I_F \\tau_T$, is subsequently removed by the reverse current.\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\nThe given values are:\n- $I_F = 10\\,\\mathrm{mA} = 10 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A}$\n- $I_R = -100\\,\\mathrm{mA}$, so $|I_R| = 100 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A}$\n- $\\tau_T = 50\\,\\mathrm{ns} = 50 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n\n**Calculate $Q_{rr}$:**\n$$\nQ_{rr} = I_F \\tau_T = (10 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A}) \\times (50 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{s})\n$$\n$$\nQ_{rr} = 500 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{C} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{C}\n$$\nAs required, in nanocoulombs and rounded to three significant figures:\n$$\nQ_{rr} = 0.500\\,\\mathrm{nC}\n$$\n\n**Calculate $t_{rr}$:**\n$$\nt_{rr} = \\frac{I_F \\tau_T}{|I_R|} = \\frac{(10 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A}) \\times (50 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{s})}{100 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A}}\n$$\n$$\nt_{rr} = \\frac{500 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{C}}{100 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A}} = 5 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nAs required, in nanoseconds and rounded to three significant figures:\n$$\nt_{rr} = 5.00\\,\\mathrm{ns}\n$$\n\nThe pair of numerical answers is $(Q_{rr}, t_{rr}) = (0.500\\,\\mathrm{nC}, 5.00\\,\\mathrm{ns})$.",
