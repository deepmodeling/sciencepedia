A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of Drain Current Equations**\n\nWe begin from fundamental principles. Let $y$ be the position along the channel from the source ($y=0$) to the drain ($y=L$). The channel potential at position $y$ is $V(y)$, with boundary conditions $V(0)=0$ and $V(L)=V_{DS}$. Under the charge-sheet approximation in strong inversion, the mobile electron charge density per unit area in the channel is given by:\n$$Q_n(y) = -C_{ox}[V_{GS} - V_T - V(y)]$$\nThe drift current $I_D$ is constant along the channel. It is given by the product of the channel width $W$, the magnitude of the charge density per unit length $|Q_n(y)|$, and the electron drift velocity $v_n(y)$.\n$$I_D = W |Q_n(y)| v_n(y)$$\nThe electron drift velocity is proportional to the electric field along the channel, $E_y = -dV(y)/dy$. The velocity is $v_n(y) = -\\mu_n E_y = \\mu_n \\frac{dV(y)}{dy}$. Substituting the expressions for $|Q_n(y)|$ and $v_n(y)$:\n$$I_D = W \\left(C_{ox}[V_{GS} - V_T - V(y)]\\right) \\left(\\mu_n \\frac{dV(y)}{dy}\\right)$$\nWe rearrange and integrate along the channel length:\n$$\\int_0^L I_D dy = \\int_0^{V_{DS}} W \\mu_n C_{ox} [V_{GS} - V_T - V(y)] dV(y)$$\nSince $I_D$ is constant with $y$, we perform the integration:\n$$I_D L = W \\mu_n C_{ox} \\left[ (V_{GS} - V_T)V - \\frac{1}{2}V^2 \\right]_0^{V_{DS}}$$\n$$I_D L = W \\mu_n C_{ox} \\left[ (V_{GS} - V_T)V_{DS} - \\frac{1}{2}V_{DS}^2 \\right]$$\nThis gives the drain current in the **linear (or triode) region**, valid for $0 \\le V_{DS} \\le V_{GS} - V_T$:\n$$I_{D,lin} = \\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} \\left[ (V_{GS} - V_T)V_{DS} - \\frac{1}{2}V_{DS}^2 \\right]$$\nThe **saturation region** begins when $V_{DS}$ reaches the pinch-off voltage, $V_{DS,sat} = V_{GS} - V_T$. For $V_{DS} \\ge V_{DS,sat}$, the long-channel model assumes the current saturates at the value $I_{D,sat}$, which is found by substituting $V_{DS} = V_{GS} - V_T$ into the linear-region equation:\n$$I_{D,sat} = \\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} \\left[ (V_{GS} - V_T)(V_{GS} - V_T) - \\frac{1}{2}(V_{GS} - V_T)^2 \\right]$$\n$$I_{D,sat} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} (V_{GS} - V_T)^2$$\n\n**Numerical Evaluation of Drain Current**\n\nFirst, we calculate the device transconductance parameter, $k_n = \\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L}$:\n$$k_n = (0.05~\\mathrm{m}^{2}/(\\mathrm{V}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}))(3.5 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{F/m}^{2})\\left(\\frac{10~\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{1~\\mu\\mathrm{m}}\\right) = 1.75 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{A/V}^2$$\nThe overdrive voltage is $V_{OV} = V_{GS} - V_T = 0.75~\\mathrm{V} - 0.45~\\mathrm{V} = 0.30~\\mathrm{V}$. The saturation drain voltage is $V_{DS,sat} = V_{OV} = 0.30~\\mathrm{V}$.\n\n- **At Bias Point 1 ($V_{DS} = 0.10~\\mathrm{V}$)**:\nSince $V_{DS} < V_{DS,sat}$, the device is in the linear region.\n$$I_{D,1} = k_n \\left[ V_{OV}V_{DS} - \\frac{1}{2}V_{DS}^2 \\right]$$\n$$I_{D,1} = (1.75 \\times 10^{-3}) \\left[ (0.30)(0.10) - \\frac{1}{2}(0.10)^2 \\right] = (1.75 \\times 10^{-3}) [0.03 - 0.005]$$\n$$I_{D,1} = (1.75 \\times 10^{-3})(0.025) = 4.375 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{A} = 43.75~\\mu\\mathrm{A}$$\n\n- **At Bias Point 2 ($V_{DS} = 0.35~\\mathrm{V}$)**:\nSince $V_{DS} > V_{DS,sat}$, the device is in the saturation region.\n$$I_{D,2} = \\frac{1}{2} k_n V_{OV}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} (1.75 \\times 10^{-3}) (0.30)^2$$\n$$I_{D,2} = (0.5)(1.75 \\times 10^{-3})(0.09) = 7.875 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{A} = 78.75~\\mu\\mathrm{A}$$\n\n**First-Order Model and Evaluation**\n\nThe first-order model $I_{D}^{(1)}$ is obtained by linearizing the current equation about $V_{DS}=0$. We use a first-order Taylor expansion of the linear region equation for $I_D(V_{DS})$:\n$$I_{D}^{(1)}(V_{DS}) = I_D(0) + \\left. \\frac{dI_D}{dV_{DS}} \\right|_{V_{DS}=0} \\cdot V_{DS}$$\nFrom the linear region equation, $I_D(0)=0$. The derivative is:\n$$\\frac{dI_D}{dV_{DS}} = \\frac{d}{dV_{DS}} \\left( k_n \\left[ V_{OV}V_{DS} - \\frac{1}{2}V_{DS}^2 \\right] \\right) = k_n [V_{OV} - V_{DS}]$$\nEvaluating at $V_{DS}=0$:\n$$\\left. \\frac{dI_D}{dV_{DS}} \\right|_{V_{DS}=0} = k_n V_{OV}$$\nThus, the first-order model is:\n$$I_{D}^{(1)}(V_{DS}) = (k_n V_{OV}) V_{DS}$$\nWe calculate the coefficient $k_n V_{OV}$:\n$$k_n V_{OV} = (1.75 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{A/V}^2)(0.30~\\mathrm{V}) = 5.25 \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{A/V}$$\nNow, we evaluate $I_{D}^{(1)}$ at the two bias points.

The language is objective and precise. The problem is directly relevant to the specified topic of long-channel MOSFET modeling.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. We proceed with the solution.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Ideal Threshold Voltage $V_{T,\\mathrm{ideal}}$\n\nThe threshold voltage is the gate-to-source voltage $V_{GS}$ required to create a conducting channel. With the source and substrate connected to ground, $V_{GS} = V_{G}$. The applied gate voltage $V_G$ is balanced by the potential drops across the MOS structure. For an ideal device (no fixed or trapped charges), the voltage balance is established by considering the flat-band voltage, $V_{FB,\\mathrm{ideal}}$, which is the voltage needed to counteract the work function difference between the metal gate and the semiconductor, $\\phi_{ms} = \\phi_m - \\phi_{Si}$.\n$$V_{FB,\\mathrm{ideal}} = \\phi_{ms} = \\phi_m - \\phi_{Si}$$\nAny additional applied voltage beyond $V_{FB,\\mathrm{ideal}}$ creates a potential drop across the oxide, $V_{ox}$, and band bending in the semiconductor, represented by the surface potential $\\psi_s$.\n$$V_G - V_{FB,\\mathrm{ideal}} = V_{ox} + \\psi_s$$\nThe voltage across the oxide is related to the total charge per unit area in the silicon, $Q_{Si}$, by the oxide capacitance per unit area, $C_{ox}$. By Gauss's law, $V_{ox} = -Q_{Si}/C_{ox}$. The negative sign arises because a positive gate voltage for an n-channel device induces negative charge ($Q_{Si} < 0$) in the p-type silicon substrate. Substituting this into the voltage balance equation gives:\n$$V_G = V_{FB,\\mathrm{ideal}} + \\psi_s - \\frac{Q_{Si}}{C_{ox}}$$\nThe threshold condition is defined by the onset of strong inversion, where the surface is as strongly p-type as the bulk is n-type, which corresponds to a surface potential of $\\psi_s = 2\\phi_F$. At this point, the inversion layer charge is still negligible, so the total silicon charge is approximated by the depletion charge, $Q_{Si} \\approx Q_{d}$. Therefore, at threshold, $V_G = V_{T,\\mathrm{ideal}}$.\n$$V_{T,\\mathrm{ideal}} = V_{FB,\\mathrm{ideal}} + 2\\phi_F - \\frac{Q_{d}(2\\phi_F)}{C_{ox}}$$\nThe depletion charge $Q_{d}(2\\phi_F)$ is the charge of the ionized acceptors in the depletion region of width $W_{d,max}$ under a surface potential $\\psi_s = 2\\phi_F$. From the one-dimensional Poisson equation under the depletion approximation, the depletion width $W_d$ is related to the surface potential by $W_d = \\sqrt{2\\epsilon_{Si}\\psi_s / (qN_A)}$. The depletion charge is $Q_d = -qN_A W_d$.\nAt threshold, the depletion charge reaches its maximum value for inversion:\n$$Q_{d}(2\\phi_F) = -qN_A \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\epsilon_{Si}(2\\phi_F)}{qN_A}} = -\\sqrt{2q\\epsilon_{Si}N_A(2\\phi_F)}$$\nThis charge is negative. We are asked to express the formula in terms of its magnitude, $|Q_d(2\\phi_F)| = \\sqrt{2q\\epsilon_{Si}N_A(2\\phi_F)}$. Substituting $Q_d(2\\phi_F) = -|Q_d(2\\phi_F)|$ into the expression for $V_{T,\\mathrm{ideal}}$:\n$$V_{T,\\mathrm{ideal}} = V_{FB,\\mathrm{ideal}} + 2\\phi_F - \\frac{-|Q_d(2\\phi_F)|}{C_{ox}} = V_{FB,\\mathrm{ideal}} + 2\\phi_F + \\frac{|Q_d(2\\phi_F)|}{C_{ox}}$$\nSubstituting $V_{FB, \\mathrm{ideal}}=\\phi_m-\\phi_{Si}$, we arrive at the desired expression:\n$$V_{T,\\mathrm{ideal}} = (\\phi_m - \\phi_{Si}) + 2\\phi_F + \\frac{|Q_d(2\\phi_F)|}{C_{ox}}$$\nThis completes the derivation as requested.\n\n### Part 2: Calculation of the Effective Fixed Oxide Charge Density $Q_{eff}$\n\nTo calculate $V_{T,\\mathrm{ideal}}$, we first need to determine the values of $\\phi_F$ and $\\phi_{Si}$. The thermal voltage at $T=300$ K is $V_{th} = kT/q$. Using $k \\approx 1.3806 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K:\n$$V_{th} = \\frac{k T}{q} = \\frac{(1.3806 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J/K})(300 \\text{ K})}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ C}} \\approx 0.02585 \\text{ V}$$\nThe Fermi potential $\\phi_F$ for the p-type substrate is given by:\n$$\\phi_F = V_{th} \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A}{n_i}\\right) = (0.02585 \\text{ V}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{1.00 \\times 10^{16}}{1.00 \\times 10^{10}}\\right) = (0.02585 \\text{ V}) \\ln(10^6) \\approx 0.3571 \\text{ V}$$\nThe silicon work function $\\phi_{Si}$ is the energy required to move an electron from the Fermi level to vacuum. For a p-type semiconductor, it is given by:\n$$\\phi_{Si} = \\chi + \\frac{E_g}{2q} + \\phi_F = 4.05 \\text{ V} + \\frac{1.12}{2} \\text{ V} + 0.3571 \\text{ V} = 4.05 + 0.56 + 0.3571 = 4.9671 \\text{ V}$$\nThe ideal flat-band voltage is the work function difference:\n$$V_{FB,\\mathrm{ideal}} = \\phi_m - \\phi_{Si} = 4.70 \\text{ V} - 4.9671 \\text{ V} = -0.2671 \\text{ V}$$\nNext, we calculate the magnitude of the depletion charge at threshold. The silicon permittivity is $\\epsilon_{Si} = 11.7 \\times 8.854 \\times 10^{-14} \\text{ F/cm} = 1.036 \\times 10^{-12}$ F/cm.\n$$|Q_d(2\\phi_F)| = \\sqrt{2q\\epsilon_{Si}N_A(2\\phi_F)} = \\sqrt{2(1.602 \\times 10^{-19})(1.036 \\times 10^{-12})(1.00 \\times 10^{16})(2 \\times 0.3571)}$$\n$$|Q_d(2\\phi_F)| = \\sqrt{2.373 \\times 10^{-15}} \\approx 4.871 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ C/cm}^2$$\nNow, we can compute the ideal threshold voltage:\n$$V_{T,\\mathrm{ideal}} = V_{FB,\\mathrm{ideal}} + 2\\phi_F + \\frac{|Q_d(2\\phi_F)|}{C_{ox}}$$\n$$V_{T,\\mathrm{ideal}} = -0.2671 \\text{ V} + 2(0.3571 \\text{ V}) + \\frac{4.871 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ C/cm}^2}{7.00 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ F/cm}^2}$$\n$$V_{T,\\mathrm{ideal}} = -0.2671 + 0.7142 + 0.06959 \\approx 0.5167 \\text{ V}$$\nThe presence of a fixed oxide charge $Q_{eff}$ at the interface modifies the threshold voltage. The charge $Q_{eff}$ contributes to the electric field in the oxide, introducing a voltage shift. The measured threshold voltage $V_{T,\\mathrm{meas}}$ is related to the ideal one by:\n$$V_{T,\\mathrm{meas}} = V_{T,\\mathrm{ideal}} - \\frac{Q_{eff}}{C_{ox}}$$\nThe voltage shift $\\Delta V_T$ is $\\Delta V_T = V_{T,\\mathrm{meas}} - V_{T,\\mathrm{ideal}} = -Q_{eff}/C_{ox}$. We can solve for $Q_{eff}$:\n$$Q_{eff} = -C_{ox}(V_{T,\\mathrm{meas}} - V_{T,\\mathrm{ideal}})$$\nUsing the given $V_{T,\\mathrm{meas}} = 0.450$ V and our calculated $V_{T,\\mathrm{ideal}}$:\n$$Q_{eff} = -(7.00 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ F/cm}^2)(0.450 \\text{ V} - 0.5167 \\text{ V})$$\n$$Q_{eff} = -(7.00 \\times 10^{-7})(-0.0667) = 4.669 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ C/cm}^2$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $Q_{eff} = 4.67 \\times 10^{-8}$ C/cm$^{2}$.\n\n### Part 3: Plausibility Assessment\n\nThe calculated effective fixed oxide charge density $Q_{eff}$ is positive. This is physically consistent with the properties of the Si-SiO$_2$ interface, where $Q_{eff}$ is typically positive due to structural defects related to incompletely oxidized silicon ions near the interface. A positive $Q_{eff}$ helps to attract electrons to the silicon surface, which lowers the gate voltage required to achieve inversion, thus reducing the threshold voltage. Our result, where $V_{T,\\mathrm{meas}} < V_{T,\\mathrm{ideal}}$, is consistent with a positive $Q_{eff}$.\n\nTo assess the magnitude, we can convert $Q_{eff}$ to the number of elementary charges per unit area, $N_{eff}$:\n$$N_{eff} = \\frac{|Q_{eff}|}{q} = \\frac{4.67 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ C/cm}^2}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ C}} \\approx 2.91 \\times 10^{11} \\text{ cm}^{-2}$$\nFor high-quality, modern silicon manufacturing processes, the fixed oxide charge density is typically in the range of $10^{10}$ to a few times $10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$. The calculated value of $2.91 \\times 10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ falls within this physically plausible range. While it is on the higher side for a state-of-the-art logic process, it is a very reasonable value for many contemporary silicon processes. Therefore, the magnitude and sign of the extracted $Q_{eff}$ are physically plausible.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the total channel charge $Q_{ch}$ in a long-channel n-MOSFET operating in the linear region. The derivation must be based on fundamental principles and must be valid to leading order in the small parameter $V_{DS}/(V_{GS}-V_{T})$.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in two steps. First, an expression for the local inversion charge density per unit area, $Q_{i}(x)$, is found. Second, this expression is integrated along the channel length to find the total charge $Q_{ch}$, under an assumption appropriate for the linear region of operation.\n\n**Step 1: Derivation of Inversion Charge Density $Q_{i}(x)$**\n\nThe problem states that under the quasi-static, gradual-channel approximation (GCA), the gate-oxide-semiconductor structure behaves as a parallel-plate capacitor. The gate acts as one plate, and the semiconductor surface (the channel) acts as the other. Per Gauss's law, the total charge per unit area induced in the semiconductor, $Q_{s}(x)$, is equal and opposite to the charge on the gate, $Q_{g}(x)$.\n\nThe voltage across the oxide capacitor at a position $x$ along the channel is the difference between the gate potential, $V_G$, and the local channel potential, $V(x)$. Both potentials are referenced to the source, which is grounded. Thus, $V_G = V_{GS}$. The voltage across the oxide is $V_{GS} - V(x)$.\n\nThe charge per unit area on the gate is given by $Q_{g}(x) = C_{ox}(V_{GS} - V(x))$, where $C_{ox}$ is the gate-oxide capacitance per unit area. Consequently, the total charge per unit area induced in the semiconductor is:\n$$Q_{s}(x) = -Q_{g}(x) = -C_{ox}(V_{GS} - V(x))$$\n\nThis total semiconductor charge $Q_{s}(x)$ consists of two components: the mobile inversion charge (electrons in the n-channel), $Q_{i}(x)$, and the fixed depletion charge (ionized acceptors in the p-type bulk), $Q_b(x)$.\n$$Q_{s}(x) = Q_{i}(x) + Q_b(x)$$\n\nThe problem specifies using the definition of the threshold voltage, $V_T$, to proceed. $V_T$ is the gate-to-source voltage at which a strong inversion layer just begins to form at the source end of the channel ($x=0$, where $V(0)=0$). In the simple charge-control model, which is appropriate here, the threshold voltage $V_T$ accounts for all the prerequisites for forming the channel. This includes establishing the necessary surface potential for strong inversion and supporting the depletion charge.\n\nThe key insight of the charge-control model for strong inversion ($V_{GS} > V_T$) is that the depletion charge density, $Q_b(x)$, is assumed to be only weakly dependent on the gate voltage and is primarily determined by the local channel-to-body potential, $V(x)$. For simplicity in the basic model, the depletion charge's effect is bundled into the constant parameter $V_T$. The voltage available to create the mobile inversion charge at position $x$ is the amount by which the local gate-to-channel voltage, $V_{GS} - V(x)$, exceeds the threshold voltage, $V_T$.\n\nTherefore, the inversion charge per unit area, $Q_{i}(x)$, is given by:\n$$Q_{i}(x) = -C_{ox}[V_{GS} - V(x) - V_{T}]$$\nThe negative sign indicates that for an n-channel MOSFET (where $V_{GS} > V_T$), the charge carriers are electrons. This expression is valid as long as the channel is in strong inversion at position $x$, i.e., $V_{GS} - V(x) > V_T$. Since the problem specifies operation in the linear region, $V_{DS}$ is small, which means $0 \\leq V(x) \\leq V_{DS} \\ll V_{GS}-V_{T}$. This condition is satisfied all along the channel. This expression is consistent with the problem's definition of $V_T$, as for $V_{GS} = V_T$ at the source end ($x=0, V(0)=0$), the inversion charge $Q_i(0)$ becomes zero.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluation of Total Channel Charge $Q_{ch}$**\n\nThe total channel charge, $Q_{ch}$, is defined as the integral of the magnitude of the inversion charge density over the area of the channel:\n$$Q_{ch} = -W \\int_{0}^{L} Q_{i}(x)\\,dx$$\nwhere $W$ is the channel width and $L$ is the channel length. Substituting the derived expression for $Q_{i}(x)$:\n$$Q_{ch} = -W \\int_{0}^{L} \\left( -C_{ox}[V_{GS} - V_T - V(x)] \\right) dx$$\n$$Q_{ch} = W C_{ox} \\int_{0}^{L} [V_{GS} - V_T - V(x)] dx$$\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we need an expression for the channel potential profile, $V(x)$. The problem specifies an evaluation to leading order in the small parameter $V_{DS}/(V_{GS}-V_{T})$, which defines the linear (or triode) region of operation. In this regime, since $V_{DS}$ is small, the channel resistance is nearly uniform along its length.\n\n**Assumption:** For a device operating in the deep linear region ($V_{DS} \\ll V_{GS}-V_T$), the resistive channel is approximately uniform. This implies a constant electric field, $E_x$, along the channel. Therefore, we assume that the channel potential, $V(x)$, varies linearly with position $x$ from the source ($x=0$) to the drain ($x=L$).\n\nGiven the boundary conditions $V(0)=0$ and $V(L)=V_{DS}$, the linear potential profile is:\n$$V(x) = \\frac{V_{DS}}{L}x$$\nThis assumption is precisely the approximation that yields the leading-order behavior in $V_{DS}$.\n\nWe now substitute this linear profile for $V(x)$ into the integral for $Q_{ch}$:\n$$Q_{ch} = W C_{ox} \\int_{0}^{L} \\left[ (V_{GS} - V_T) - \\frac{V_{DS}}{L}x \\right] dx$$\n\nPerforming the integration:\n$$Q_{ch} = W C_{ox} \\left[ (V_{GS} - V_T)x - \\frac{V_{DS}}{L}\\frac{x^2}{2} \\right]_{0}^{L}$$\n\nEvaluating the expression at the limits of integration ($x=L$ and $x=0$):\n$$Q_{ch} = W C_{ox} \\left( \\left[ (V_{GS} - V_T)L - \\frac{V_{DS}}{L}\\frac{L^2}{2} \\right] - \\left[ 0 - 0 \\right] \\right)$$\n$$Q_{ch} = W C_{ox} \\left( (V_{GS} - V_T)L - \\frac{V_{DS}L}{2} \\right)$$\n\nFactoring out the channel length $L$, we obtain the final closed-form expression for the total channel charge:\n$$Q_{ch} = W L C_{ox} \\left( V_{GS} - V_T - \\frac{V_{DS}}{2} \\right)$$\nThis result represents the total gate capacitance, $C_G = WLC_{ox}$, multiplied by the average gate overdrive voltage across the channel, where the average channel potential is $\\frac{V_{DS}}{2}$ under the linear approximation. This expression is the correct leading-order result for the total channel charge in the linear region.",
