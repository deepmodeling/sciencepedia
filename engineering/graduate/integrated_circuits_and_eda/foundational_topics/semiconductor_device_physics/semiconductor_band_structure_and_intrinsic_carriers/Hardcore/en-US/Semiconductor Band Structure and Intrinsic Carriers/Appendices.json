The task involves a standard, albeit detailed, derivation and numerical implementation rooted in fundamental solid-state physics. The omission of the electron rest mass $m_0$ is trivial, as it is a fundamental physical constant whose value is universally established. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution is provided below.\n\nThe total electron concentration $n$ in the conduction band is determined by integrating the product of the density of states $D_c(E)$ and the Fermi–Dirac occupation probability $f(E; E_F, T)$ over all available energies in the band:\n$$\nn = \\int_{E_C}^{\\infty} D_c(E) f(E; E_F, T) \\, dE\n$$\nSubstituting the provided expressions for $D_c(E)$ and $f(E;E_F,T)$:\n$$\nn = \\int_{E_C}^{\\infty} \\left[\\frac{1}{2\\pi^2}\\left(\\frac{2 m_c^\\star}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2}\\sqrt{E - E_C}\\right] \\left[\\frac{1}{1+\\exp\\left(\\frac{E - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)}\\right] dE\n$$\nTo simplify this integral and relate it to the standard Fermi–Dirac integral form, we perform a change of variables. Let $x = (E - E_C)/(k_B T)$. This implies $E = E_C + x k_B T$ and $dE = k_B T \\, dx$. The lower limit of integration $E = E_C$ becomes $x = 0$, and the upper limit $E \\to \\infty$ becomes $x \\to \\infty$. The term $\\sqrt{E - E_C}$ becomes $\\sqrt{x k_B T} = (k_B T)^{1/2} x^{1/2}$. The argument of the exponential in the Fermi function becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{E - E_F}{k_B T} = \\frac{(E_C + x k_B T) - E_F}{k_B T} = x - \\frac{E_F - E_C}{k_B T}\n$$\nWe define the dimensionless Fermi level for electrons, $\\eta_c$, as $\\eta_c \\equiv (E_F - E_C)/(k_B T)$. The argument is then $x - \\eta_c$. Substituting these into the integral for $n$:\n$$\nn = \\frac{1}{2\\pi^2}\\left(\\frac{2 m_c^\\star}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2} \\int_0^{\\infty} (k_B T)^{1/2} x^{1/2} \\frac{1}{1+\\exp(x - \\eta_c)} (k_B T) \\, dx\n$$\nGrouping the constant terms outside the integral:\n$$\nn = \\left[ \\frac{1}{2\\pi^2}\\left(\\frac{2 m_c^\\star k_B T}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2} \\right] \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{x^{1/2}}{1+\\exp(x - \\eta_c)} \\, dx\n$$\nThe integral is precisely the definition of the complete Fermi-Dirac integral of order one-half, $F_{1/2}(\\eta_c)$, given in the problem statement. Thus, the electron concentration is:\n$$\nn = \\frac{1}{2\\pi^2}\\left(\\frac{2 m_c^\\star k_B T}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2} F_{1/2}(\\eta_c)\n$$\nAn analogous procedure is followed for the hole concentration $p$ in the valence band. The concentration of holes at energy $E$ is the product of the density of states $D_v(E)$ and the probability that a state is empty, which is $1 - f(E; E_F, T)$.\n$$\np = \\int_{-\\infty}^{E_V} D_v(E) [1 - f(E; E_F, T)] \\, dE\n$$\nFirst, we note that $1 - f(E) = 1 - \\frac{1}{1+e^{(E-E_F)/k_B T}} = \\frac{e^{(E-E_F)/k_B T}}{1+e^{(E-E_F)/k_B T}} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-(E-E_F)/k_B T}} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{(E_F-E)/k_B T}}$. The integral for $p$ is then:\n$$\np = \\int_{-\\infty}^{E_V} \\left[\\frac{1}{2\\pi^2}\\left(\\frac{2 m_v^\\star}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2}\\sqrt{E_V - E}\\right] \\left[\\frac{1}{1+\\exp\\left(\\frac{E_F - E}{k_B T}\\right)}\\right] dE\n$$\nWe perform a change of variables suitable for the valence band: let $x = (E_V - E)/(k_B T)$. This gives $E = E_V - x k_B T$ and $dE = -k_B T \\, dx$. The integration limits become $E \\to E_V \\implies x \\to 0$ and $E \\to -\\infty \\implies x \\to \\infty$. The negative sign in $dE$ flips the integration limits back to $0$ to $\\infty$. The term $\\sqrt{E_V - E}$ becomes $\\sqrt{x k_B T} = (k_B T)^{1/2} x^{1/2}$. The argument of the exponential becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{E_F - E}{k_B T} = \\frac{E_F - (E_V - x k_B T)}{k_B T} = x + \\frac{E_F - E_V}{k_B T} = x - \\left(\\frac{E_V - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nWe define the dimensionless Fermi level for holes, $\\eta_v$, as $\\eta_v \\equiv (E_V - E_F)/(k_B T)$. The argument is $x - \\eta_v$. Substituting these into the integral for $p$:\n$$\np = \\left[ \\frac{1}{2\\pi^2}\\left(\\frac{2 m_v^\\star k_B T}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2} \\right] \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{x^{1/2}}{1+\\exp(x - \\eta_v)} \\, dx\n$$\nThis expression has the exact same form as that for electrons, with $m_c^\\star$ replaced by $m_v^\\star$ and $\\eta_c$ replaced by $\\eta_v$:\n$$\np = \\frac{1}{2\\pi^2}\\left(\\frac{2 m_v^\\star k_B T}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2} F_{1/2}(\\eta_v)\n$$\nThe connection to the effective density of states $N_c$ and $N_v$ is established in the non-degenerate limit. This limit applies when the Fermi level is far inside the bandgap, such that $(E_C - E_F) \\gg k_B T$ (for electrons) and $(E_F - E_V) \\gg k_B T$ (for holes). This corresponds to $\\eta_c \\ll 0$ and $\\eta_v \\ll 0$. In this case, for any $x \\ge 0$, $\\exp(x - \\eta) \\gg 1$, and the Fermi-Dirac distribution can be approximated by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{1+\\exp(x-\\eta)} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\exp(x-\\eta)} = e^{\\eta}e^{-x}\n$$\nThe Fermi-Dirac integral $F_{1/2}(\\eta)$ then simplifies to:\n$$\nF_{1/2}(\\eta) \\approx \\int_0^\\infty x^{1/2} e^{\\eta}e^{-x} \\, dx = e^{\\eta} \\int_0^\\infty x^{1/2} e^{-x} \\, dx\n$$\nThe remaining integral is the Gamma function $\\Gamma(z) = \\int_0^\\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt$ with $z-1 = 1/2$, so $z=3/2$. The value is $\\Gamma(3/2) = (1/2)\\Gamma(1/2) = \\sqrt{\\pi}/2$. Therefore, in the non-degenerate limit:\n$$\nF_{1/2}(\\eta) \\approx e^{\\eta} \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}\n$$\nSubstituting this approximation into the expression for $n$:\n$$\nn \\approx \\frac{1}{2\\pi^2}\\left(\\frac{2 m_c^\\star k_B T}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2} \\left[ e^{\\eta_c} \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} \\right] = \\left[ 2 \\left(\\frac{m_c^\\star k_B T}{2\\pi\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2} \\right] e^{\\eta_c}\n$$\nThe term in brackets is the standard definition of the effective density of states for the conduction band, $N_c$. So, we recover the familiar non-degenerate formula:\n$$\nn \\approx N_c \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_F - E_C}{k_B T}\\right) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad N_c \\equiv 2 \\left(\\frac{m_c^\\star k_B T}{2\\pi\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2}\n$$\nA completely parallel argument for holes yields:\n$$\np \\approx N_v \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_V - E_F}{k_B T}\\right) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad N_v \\equiv 2 \\left(\\frac{m_v^\\star k_B T}{2\\pi\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2}\n$$\nThis demonstrates how the full Fermi-Dirac integral formulation generalizes the simpler model based on $N_c$ and $N_v$, which is only accurate in the non-degenerate regime.\n\nFor the numerical evaluation, a robust algorithm for $F_{1/2}(\\eta)$ is required. The integral must be handled carefully in its asymptotic regimes.\n1.  For strongly negative $\\eta$ (e.g., $\\eta < -25$), the non-degenerate approximation $F_{1/2}(\\eta) \\approx e^{\\eta}\\sqrt{\\pi}/2$ is highly accurate and avoids numerical underflow.\n2.  For strongly positive $\\eta$ (e.g., $\\eta > 50$), the material is degenerate. A Sommerfeld expansion provides an accurate approximation: $F_{1/2}(\\eta) \\approx \\frac{2}{3}\\eta^{3/2} (1 + \\frac{\\pi^2}{8\\eta^2})$. This form is numerically stable for large $\\eta$.\n3.  For intermediate values of $\\eta$ (e.g., $-25 \\le \\eta \\le 50$), direct numerical quadrature of the integral definition is both feasible and accurate. We use `scipy.integrate.quad` for this purpose.\n\nThe computation will proceed by using the physical constants in SI units: $k_B=1.380649\\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K}$, $h=6.62607015\\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J\\cdot s}$, $\\hbar=h/(2\\pi)$, $q=1.602176634\\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$, and $m_0=9.1093837015 \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$. The dimensionless arguments $\\eta_c$ and $\\eta_v$ are formed using energies in electronvolts ($\\mathrm{eV}$) and the Boltzmann constant in units of $\\mathrm{eV/K}$. The final carrier concentrations, calculated in $\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$, are converted to $\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ by multiplying by $10^{-6}$.",
