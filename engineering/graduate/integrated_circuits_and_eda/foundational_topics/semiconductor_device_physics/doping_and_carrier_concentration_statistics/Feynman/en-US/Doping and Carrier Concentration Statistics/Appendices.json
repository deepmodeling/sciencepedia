The dispersion relation, Maxwell-Boltzmann approximation, and the concept of effective density of states are all cornerstone principles of solid-state device physics. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. A key aspect to verify is the consistency of providing the density-of-states effective mass $m_{n}^{*}$ for silicon while also asking about the valley degeneracy factor. For silicon, the conduction band has $M_v=6$ equivalent minima (valleys). The density-of-states effective mass, $m_n^*$, is specifically defined to consolidate the effects of these multiple anisotropic valleys into a single parameter for a simplified spherical band model. The provided value, $m_{n}^{*} = 1.08\\,m_{0}$, is the standard, accepted value for silicon that already incorporates the valley degeneracy. Thus, the problem is not contradictory but is constructed to test the understanding of this definition. The problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid and can be solved as stated.\n\n**Derivation of the Effective Density of States $N_c(T)$**\n\nThe total electron concentration $n$ in the conduction band is given by integrating the product of the density of states per unit energy, $g_c(E)$, and the probability of occupancy, $f(E)$, over all available energy states in the band.\n$$n = \\int_{E_c}^{\\infty} g_c(E) f(E) \\, dE$$\nwhere $E_c$ is the conduction band minimum energy. In the nondegenerate limit, the Fermi-Dirac distribution $f(E)$ can be approximated by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution:\n$$f(E) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{E-E_F}{k_B T}\\right)} \\approx \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E-E_F}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nHere, $E_F$ is the Fermi energy, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. Substituting the approximation into the expression for $n$:\n$$n = \\int_{E_c}^{\\infty} g_c(E) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E-E_F}{k_B T}\\right) \\, dE = \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_F - E_c}{k_B T}\\right) \\int_{E_c}^{\\infty} g_c(E) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E-E_c}{k_B T}\\right) \\, dE$$\nThe effective density of states $N_c(T)$ is defined such that $n = N_c(T) \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_F - E_c}{k_B T}\\right)$. Therefore, $N_c(T)$ must be equal to the integral term:\n$$N_c(T) = \\int_{E_c}^{\\infty} g_c(E) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E-E_c}{k_B T}\\right) \\, dE$$\nTo evaluate this, we must first derive the expression for the density of states $g_c(E)$. The density of states in reciprocal space ($\\mathbf{k}$-space) is uniform. Including a factor of $2$ for spin degeneracy, the number of states per unit volume of $\\mathbf{k}$-space is $\\frac{2}{(2\\pi)^3}$. The number of states $dN$ within a spherical shell in $\\mathbf{k}$-space of radius $|\\mathbf{k}|$ and thickness $d|\\mathbf{k}|$ in a crystal of volume $V$ is:\n$$dN = \\frac{2V}{(2\\pi)^3} (4\\pi |\\mathbf{k}|^2 d|\\mathbf{k}|)$$\nThe density of states per unit volume of the crystal is $g(k)d|\\mathbf{k}| = \\frac{dN}{V}$:\n$$g(k)d|\\mathbf{k}| = \\frac{|\\mathbf{k}|^2}{\\pi^2} d|\\mathbf{k}|$$\nWe use the given parabolic dispersion relation $E-E_c = \\frac{\\hbar^2 |\\mathbf{k}|^2}{2 m_n^*}$ to transform from $\\mathbf{k}$-space to energy space.\nFrom the dispersion relation, we have:\n$$|\\mathbf{k}| = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 m_n^* (E-E_c)}{\\hbar^2}}$$\n$$d|\\mathbf{k}| = \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\sqrt{\\frac{m_n^*}{2(E-E_c)}} dE$$\nThe density of states in terms of energy, $g_c(E)$, is found by substituting these into the expression for $g(k)d|\\mathbf{k}|$ such that $g_c(E)dE = g(k)d|\\mathbf{k}|$:\n$$g_c(E)dE = \\frac{1}{\\pi^2} \\left( \\frac{2 m_n^* (E-E_c)}{\\hbar^2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\sqrt{\\frac{m_n^*}{2(E-E_c)}} dE \\right)$$\n$$g_c(E) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi^2} \\left(\\frac{2 m_n^*}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2} \\sqrt{E-E_c}$$\n\n**Justification of the Valley Degeneracy Factor**\nThe above derivation for $g_c(E)$ assumes a single, isotropic, parabolic band minimum. However, the conduction band of silicon features $M_v=6$ equivalent minima (valleys) located symmetrically along the $<100>$ axes in $\\mathbf{k}$-space. The constant-energy surfaces near these minima are ellipsoidal, corresponding to an anisotropic effective mass with longitudinal ($m_l$) and transverse ($m_t$) components. The total density of states is the sum of contributions from all valleys. This complex structure can be accurately represented by a simplified spherical band model if one uses the \"density-of-states effective mass,\" $m_n^*$. This mass is defined as $m_n^* = M_v^{2/3} (m_l m_t^2)^{1/3}$. The term $(m_l m_t^2)^{1/3}$ is the density-of-states mass for a single valley, and the $M_v^{2/3}$ factor correctly scales this to account for all $M_v=6$ valleys. The problem provides $m_n^* = 1.08\\,m_0$, which is precisely this total density-of-states effective mass for silicon. Therefore, the effect of the $6$ valleys is already incorporated into the given value of $m_n^*$. No additional multiplication by a valley degeneracy factor $M_v$ is required, as this would constitute double-counting.\n\nNow, we substitute the derived $g_c(E)$ into the integral for $N_c(T)$:\n$$N_c(T) = \\int_{E_c}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2\\pi^2} \\left(\\frac{2 m_n^*}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2} \\sqrt{E-E_c} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E-E_c}{k_B T}\\right) dE$$\nLet $x = \\frac{E-E_c}{k_B T}$. This implies $E-E_c = x k_B T$ and $dE = k_B T dx$. The integration limits change from $[E_c, \\infty)$ to $[0, \\infty)$.\n$$N_c(T) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi^2} \\left(\\frac{2 m_n^*}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\sqrt{x k_B T} \\exp(-x) (k_B T dx)$$\n$$N_c(T) = \\frac{(k_B T)^{3/2}}{2\\pi^2} \\left(\\frac{2 m_n^*}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} x^{1/2} \\exp(-x) dx$$\nThe integral is the Gamma function $\\Gamma(z) = \\int_0^\\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt$ with $z-1=1/2$, so $z=3/2$. The value is $\\Gamma(3/2) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}$.\n$$N_c(T) = \\frac{(k_B T)^{3/2}}{2\\pi^2} \\left(\\frac{2 m_n^*}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2} \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{4\\pi^2} \\frac{2^{3/2} (m_n^* k_B T)^{3/2}}{\\hbar^3}$$\nSimplifying and grouping terms:\n$$N_c(T) = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{\\pi}}{4\\pi^2} \\frac{(m_n^* k_B T)^{3/2}}{\\hbar^3} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}\\pi^{3/2}} \\frac{(m_n^* k_B T)^{3/2}}{\\hbar^3}$$\nThis expression can be written in its more conventional form:\n$$N_c(T) = 2 \\left( \\frac{m_n^* k_B T}{2\\pi \\hbar^2} \\right)^{3/2}$$\nThis is the required analytic expression for the conduction-band effective density of states.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation for Silicon**\n\nWe are asked to evaluate $N_c$ at $T=300\\,\\mathrm{K}$ for silicon, using $m_n^* = 1.08\\,m_0$, and to use the Planck constant $h$ instead of $\\hbar$. We substitute $\\hbar = h/(2\\pi)$ into the formula:\n$$N_c(T) = 2 \\left( \\frac{m_n^* k_B T}{2\\pi (h/2\\pi)^2} \\right)^{3/2} = 2 \\left( \\frac{m_n^* k_B T}{2\\pi h^2/(4\\pi^2)} \\right)^{3/2} = 2 \\left( \\frac{2\\pi m_n^* k_B T}{h^2} \\right)^{3/2}$$\nThe fundamental constants in SI units are:\n- Electron rest mass: $m_0 = 9.1093837 \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- Boltzmann constant: $k_B = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J} \\cdot \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n- Planck constant: $h = 6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}$\n\nThe parameters are:\n- Temperature: $T = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- Density-of-states effective mass: $m_n^* = 1.08 \\times m_0 = 1.08 \\times (9.1093837 \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{kg}) = 9.8381344 \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n\nNow, we calculate the term inside the parenthesis:\n$$ \\frac{2\\pi m_n^* k_B T}{h^2} = \\frac{2\\pi (9.8381344 \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{kg})(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K})(300\\,\\mathrm{K})}{(6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J \\cdot s})^2} $$\n$$ \\frac{2\\pi m_n^* k_B T}{h^2} = \\frac{2.55998 \\times 10^{-50}\\,\\mathrm{kg \\cdot J}}{4.39048 \\times 10^{-67}\\,\\mathrm{J^2 \\cdot s^2}} = 5.83069 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-2}} $$\nNow, we compute $N_c$:\n$$ N_c = 2 \\times (5.83069 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-2}})^{3/2} = 2 \\times (1.40820 \\times 10^{25}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}) $$\n$$ N_c = 2.8164 \\times 10^{25}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}} $$\nThe problem requires the result in units of $\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.

            "solution": "The problem is validated as self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. The concepts of quasi-Fermi levels, carrier statistics under the Boltzmann approximation, and low-level injection are standard in semiconductor device physics. The assumptions are explicit and consistent, allowing for a unique analytical solution.\n\nThe starting point for this derivation is the expressions for the electron concentration, $n$, and the hole concentration, $p$, in a non-degenerate semiconductor. Under non-equilibrium conditions, these concentrations are described using separate quasi-Fermi levels, $E_{F n}$ for electrons and $E_{F p}$ for holes. The Boltzmann approximation to the Fermi-Dirac distribution is assumed to be valid.\n\nThe electron concentration $n$ is given by the integral of the density of states in the conduction band multiplied by the Fermi-Dirac distribution. Under the Boltzmann approximation, where $(E_c - E_{Fn}) \\gg k_B T$, this simplifies to:\n$$n = N_{c} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{c} - E_{F n}}{k_{B} T}\\right)$$\nHere, $N_{c}$ is the effective density of states in the conduction band, $E_{c}$ is the conduction band energy edge, $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nSimilarly, the hole concentration $p$ is given by:\n$$p = N_{v} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{F p} - E_{v}}{k_{B} T}\\right)$$\nHere, $N_{v}$ is the effective density of states in the valence band and $E_{v}$ is the valence band energy edge.\n\nThe problem requires a relation involving the quasi-Fermi level splitting, $E_{F n} - E_{F p}$. To find this, we can take the product of the electron and hole concentrations, $n \\cdot p$:\n$$np = \\left[N_{c} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{c} - E_{F n}}{k_{B} T}\\right)\\right] \\left[N_{v} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{F p} - E_{v}}{k_{B} T}\\right)\\right]$$\nCombining the terms gives:\n$$np = N_{c} N_{v} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{c} - E_{F n} + E_{F p} - E_{v}}{k_{B} T}\\right)$$\nWe can rearrange the terms in the exponent to group the band-edge energies and the quasi-Fermi levels:\n$$np = N_{c} N_{v} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(E_{c} - E_{v}) - (E_{F n} - E_{F p})}{k_{B} T}\\right)$$\nThe term $E_{c} - E_{v}$ is the bandgap energy, $E_{g}$.

In thermal equilibrium, there is a single Fermi level, $E_{F}$, such that $E_{F n} = E_{F p} = E_{F}$. In this case, the product of the equilibrium concentrations $n_{0}$ and $p_{0}$ is equal to $n_{i}^{2}$:\n$$n_{0} p_{0} = n_{i}^{2}$$\nFrom the general expressions, setting $E_{F n} = E_{F p}$ means the term $\\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{F n} - E_{F p}}{k_{B} T}\\right)$ becomes $\\exp(0) = 1$. Thus, in equilibrium:\n$$n_{i}^{2} = N_{c} N_{v} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{g}}{k_{B} T}\\right)$$\nThis relationship defines $n_{i}^{2}$ in terms of fundamental material parameters ($N_{c}$, $N_{v}$, $E_{g}$) and temperature $T$. Since these quantities do not depend on the Fermi levels, this expression for $n_{i}^{2}$ holds true even under non-equilibrium conditions.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $n_{i}^{2}$ back into the non-equilibrium $np$ product equation, we obtain the generalized law of mass action:\n$$np = n_{i}^{2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{F n} - E_{F p}}{k_{B} T}\\right)$$\nThe problem asks for the quantity $\\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{F n} - E_{F p}}{k_{B} T}\\right)$. We can isolate this term by rearranging the equation:\n$$\\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{F n} - E_{F p}}{k_{B} T}\\right) = \\frac{np}{n_{i}^{2}}$$\nThis is the general relationship. We now apply the specific conditions given in the problem statement. The region is $n$-type silicon under low-level injection. For an $n$-type semiconductor, the majority carriers are electrons. Low-level injection means that the excess carrier concentrations are much smaller than the majority carrier concentration. Therefore, the total electron concentration $n$ is approximately equal to its equilibrium value, which in a moderately to lightly doped $n$-type material at room temperature is approximately the donor concentration $N_{D}$ (assuming full ionization of donors). The problem explicitly states this assumption as $n \\approx N_{D}$.\n\nSubstituting $n = N_{D}$ into our derived expression, we arrive at the final relation:\n$$\\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{F n} - E_{F p}}{k_{B} T}\\right) = \\frac{N_{D} p}{n_{i}^{2}}$$\nThis equation connects the quasi-Fermi level splitting to the local minority carrier (hole) concentration $p$, the background donor concentration $N_{D}$, and the intrinsic carrier concentration $n_{i}$, as required.",
