            "problem": "An analog circuit designer is evaluating a particular NPN Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) for use in a low-power, high-gain amplifier stage. From the manufacturer's datasheet and initial measurements, the transistor is found to have an Early Voltage of $V_A = 40.0 \\text{ V}$. For the intended application, the transistor will be biased in the forward-active region with a collector current of $I_C = 150 \\text{ }\\mu\\text{A}$. The circuit operates at a temperature where the thermal voltage can be taken as $V_T = 25.85 \\text{ mV}$.\n\nThe theoretical upper limit of the voltage gain for a single-transistor amplifier is called the intrinsic voltage gain, which is defined as the product of the transistor's transconductance and its small-signal output resistance.\n\nCalculate the numerical value of this intrinsic voltage gain for the given operating conditions. Your final answer should be a dimensionless value, rounded to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the intrinsic voltage gain, let's denote it as $A_{v0}$, of a BJT under specific biasing conditions. The intrinsic gain is defined as the product of the transistor's transconductance ($g_m$) and its small-signal output resistance ($r_o$).\n\n$$A_{v0} = g_m r_o$$\n\nFirst, we determine the expression for the transconductance, $g_m$. For a BJT operating in the forward-active region, the transconductance is directly proportional to the collector current $I_C$ and inversely proportional to the thermal voltage $V_T$.\n\n$$g_m = \\frac{I_C}{V_T}$$\n\nNext, we find the expression for the small-signal output resistance, $r_o$. This resistance arises from the Early effect, which causes the collector current to have a slight dependence on the collector-emitter voltage. The output resistance is given by the ratio of the Early Voltage $V_A$ to the collector current $I_C$.\n\n$$r_o = \\frac{V_A}{I_C}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute these two expressions back into the equation for the intrinsic voltage gain $A_{v0}$.\n\n$$A_{v0} = g_m r_o = \\left( \\frac{I_C}{V_T} \\right) \\left( \\frac{V_A}{I_C} \\right)$$\n\nAs we can see from the combined expression, the collector current $I_C$ cancels out. This reveals a key characteristic of the intrinsic gain: it is independent of the DC bias current, depending only on the Early voltage and the thermal voltage.\n\n$$A_{v0} = \\frac{V_A}{V_T}$$\n\nNow we can substitute the numerical values provided in the problem statement to find the value of $A_{v0}$.

The first three significant figures are 1, 5, and 4. The fourth digit is 7, which is 5 or greater, so we round up the third significant figure (4) to 5.\n\n$$A_{v0} \\approx 1550$$\n\nTo express this unambiguously with three significant figures, we write it in scientific notation.\n\n$$A_{v0} = 1.55 \\times 10^3$$",
