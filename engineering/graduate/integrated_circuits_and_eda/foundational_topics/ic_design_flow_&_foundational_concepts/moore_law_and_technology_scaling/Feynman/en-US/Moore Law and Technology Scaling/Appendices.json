The problem asks for the derivation of the post-scaling transconductance $g_{m}'$ of a long-channel n-MOSFET. We begin from the fundamental principles of MOSFET operation.\n\nThe drain current $I_{D}$ in the saturation region for a long-channel n-MOSFET is described by the square-law model, which is a direct consequence of the gradual-channel approximation when velocity saturation is negligible:\n$$\nI_{D} = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu C_{\\text{ox}}\\frac{W}{L}(V_{\\text{GS}} - V_{T})^2\n$$\nIn this equation, $\\mu$ is the effective carrier mobility, $W$ and $L$ are the channel width and length, respectively, $V_{\\text{GS}}$ is the gate-to-source voltage, $V_{T}$ is the threshold voltage, and $C_{\\text{ox}}$ is the gate oxide capacitance per unit area.\n\nThe gate oxide capacitance per unit area is defined as:\n$$\nC_{\\text{ox}} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\text{ox}}}{t_{\\text{ox}}}\n$$\nwhere $\\varepsilon_{\\text{ox}}$ is the permittivity of the gate oxide (silicon dioxide) and $t_{\\text{ox}}$ is the oxide thickness.\n\nThe threshold voltage $V_{T}$ is given by the expression:\n$$\nV_{T} = V_{\\text{FB}} + 2\\phi_{F} - \\frac{Q_{B}}{C_{\\text{ox}}}\n$$\nFor an n-channel MOSFET, the substrate is p-type and the depletion charge $Q_{B}$ is negative. Using the magnitude of the depletion charge per unit area at threshold, $|Q_{B}| = -Q_{B}$, the expression becomes:\n$$\nV_{T} = V_{\\text{FB}} + 2\\phi_{F} + \\frac{|Q_{B}|}{C_{\\text{ox}}}\n$$\nHere, $V_{\\text{FB}}$ is the flatband voltage and $\\phi_{F}$ is the Fermi potential of the p-type substrate.\n\nThe transconductance, $g_{m}$, is defined as the rate of change of the drain current with respect to the gate-to-source voltage, at a fixed drain-to-source voltage:\n$$\ng_{m} = \\frac{\\partial I_{D}}{\\partial V_{\\text{GS}}}\n$$\nFor a device in saturation, we differentiate the saturation current expression.

The gate-to-source voltage $V_{\\text{GS}}$ is fixed.\n$$\ng_{m}' = \\mu C_{\\text{ox}}'\\frac{W}{L}(V_{\\text{GS}} - V_{T}')\n$$\nWe substitute the expressions for $C_{\\text{ox}}'$ and $V_{T}'$:\n$$\ng_{m}' = \\mu \\left(\\kappa \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\text{ox}}}{t_{\\text{ox},0}}\\right)\\frac{W}{L}\\left[V_{\\text{GS}} - \\left(V_{\\text{FB}} + 2\\phi_{F} + \\frac{|Q_{B}| t_{\\text{ox},0}}{\\kappa \\varepsilon_{\\text{ox}}}\\right)\\right]\n$$\nTo obtain the final single closed-form expression, we distribute the term $\\mu \\left(\\kappa \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\text{ox}}}{t_{\\text{ox},0}}\\right)\\frac{W}{L}$ into the brackets:\n$$\ng_{m}' = \\mu \\frac{W}{L} \\left[ \\left(\\kappa \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\text{ox}}}{t_{\\text{ox},0}}\\right) (V_{\\text{GS}} - V_{\\text{FB}} - 2\\phi_{F}) - \\left(\\kappa \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\text{ox}}}{t_{\\text{ox},0}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{|Q_{B}| t_{\\text{ox},0}}{\\kappa \\varepsilon_{\\text{ox}}}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nThe second term inside the square brackets simplifies as the factors $\\kappa$, $\\varepsilon_{\\text{ox}}$, and $t_{\\text{ox},0}$ cancel out:\n$$\n\\left(\\kappa \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\text{ox}}}{t_{\\text{ox},0}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{|Q_{B}| t_{\\text{ox},0}}{\\kappa \\varepsilon_{\\text{ox}}}\\right) = |Q_{B}|\n$$\nTherefore, the final expression for the post-scaling transconductance $g_{m}'$ is:\n$$\ng_{m}' = \\mu \\frac{W}{L} \\left[ \\frac{\\kappa \\varepsilon_{\\text{ox}}}{t_{\\text{ox},0}}(V_{\\text{GS}} - V_{\\text{FB}} - 2\\phi_{F}) - |Q_{B}| \\right]\n$$\nThis expression is the required closed-form analytical result, expressed solely in terms of the fundamental parameters and constants provided in the problem statement.",

The delay is modeled using the Elmore delay for a uniform distributed RC line. The derivation proceeds by first determining the scaled resistance and capacitance and then combining them.\n\nFirst, we define the scaled geometrical parameters of the interconnect as a function of the dimensionless scale factor $s$.\nThe initial width is $W_{0}$, thickness is $T_{0}$, and length is $L_{0}$.\nThe scaled width is given by $W(s) = s W_{0}$.\nThe scaled thickness is given by $T(s) = s^{\\beta} T_{0}$.\nThe scaled length is given by $L(s) = s^{\\gamma} L_{0}$.\nFrom these, the scaled cross-sectional area $A(s)$ is the product of the scaled width and thickness:\n$$A(s) = W(s) T(s) = (s W_{0})(s^{\\beta} T_{0}) = s^{1+\\beta} W_{0} T_{0}$$\n\nNext, we determine the effective resistivity, $\\rho_{\\text{eff}}(s)$, which accounts for size effects.

Its total resistance is $r'l$ and total capacitance is $c'l$.\n- The load is the input of the next inverter, with capacitance $c_{\\text{load}} = s c_{0}$.\n\nThe Elmore delay for this stage, $T_{\\text{stage}}$, can be computed by summing the delay contributions:\n1.  Delay due to the driver's parasitic capacitance $c_{\\text{p}}$: The resistance to this node is $r_{\\text{inv}}$. The contribution is $r_{\\text{inv}} c_{\\text{p}}$.\n2.  Delay due to the distributed wire capacitance: For an infinitesimal capacitance $c'dx$ at position $x$ along the wire ($0 \\le x \\le l$), the path resistance is $r_{\\text{inv}} + r'x$. Integrating over the wire length gives $\\int_{0}^{l} (r_{\\text{inv}} + r'x) c' dx$.\n3.  Delay due to the load capacitance $c_{\\text{load}}$: The path resistance to the end of the wire is $r_{\\text{inv}} + r'l$. The contribution is $(r_{\\text{inv}} + r'l) c_{\\text{load}}$.\n\nSumming these contributions:\n$$T_{\\text{stage}} = r_{\\text{inv}} c_{\\text{p}} + \\int_{0}^{l} (r_{\\text{inv}} + r'x) c' dx + (r_{\\text{inv}} + r'l) c_{\\text{load}}$$\n$$T_{\\text{stage}} = r_{\\text{inv}} c_{\\text{p}} + \\left[ r_{\\text{inv}}c'x + \\frac{1}{2}r'c'x^2 \\right]_{0}^{l} + (r_{\\text{inv}} + r'l) c_{\\text{load}}$$\n$$T_{\\text{stage}} = r_{\\text{inv}} c_{\\text{p}} + r_{\\text{inv}}c'l + \\frac{1}{2}r'c'l^2 + r_{\\text{inv}}c_{\\text{load}} + r'lc_{\\text{load}}$$\nGrouping terms by resistance:\n$$T_{\\text{stage}} = r_{\\text{inv}}(c_{\\text{p}} + c'l + c_{\\text{load}}) + r'l c_{\\text{load}} + \\frac{1}{2}r'c'l^2$$\nNow, substitute the given model expressions: $r_{\\text{inv}} = r_0/s$, $c_{\\text{p}} = \\phi s c_0$, $c_{\\text{load}} = s c_0$, and $l = L/M$.\n$$T_{\\text{stage}}(M,s) = \\frac{r_0}{s} \\left( \\phi s c_0 + c'\\frac{L}{M} + s c_0 \\right) + r'\\frac{L}{M}(s c_0) + \\frac{1}{2}r'c'\\left(\\frac{L}{M}\\right)^2$$\n$$T_{\\text{stage}}(M,s) = r_0 c_0 (\\phi+1) + \\frac{r_0 c' L}{sM} + \\frac{r' c_0 L s}{M} + \\frac{r'c'L^2}{2M^2}$$\nThe total delay for the $M$-segment chain is $T(M,s) = M \\times T_{\\text{stage}}(M,s)$.\n$$T(M,s) = M \\left( r_0 c_0 (\\phi+1) + \\frac{r_0 c' L}{sM} + \\frac{r' c_0 L s}{M} + \\frac{r'c'L^2}{2M^2} \\right)$$\n$$T(M,s) = M r_0 c_0 (\\phi+1) + \\frac{r_0 c' L}{s} + r' c_0 L s + \\frac{r'c'L^2}{2M}$$\n\n### Minimization of Total Delay\nTo find the optimal number of repeaters $M^{\\star}$ and size $s^{\\star}$, we take the partial derivatives of $T(M,s)$ with respect to $M$ and $s$ and set them to zero.\n\n1.  Differentiate with respect to $s$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial s} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s} \\left( M r_0 c_0 (\\phi+1) + \\frac{r_0 c' L}{s} + r' c_0 L s + \\frac{r'c'L^2}{2M} \\right) = 0$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial s} = -\\frac{r_0 c' L}{s^2} + r' c_0 L = 0$$\n$$r' c_0 L = \\frac{r_0 c' L}{s^2} \\implies s^2 = \\frac{r_0 c' L}{r' c_0 L} = \\frac{r_0 c'}{r' c_0}$$\n$$s^{\\star} = \\sqrt{\\frac{r_0 c'}{r' c_0}}$$\n\n2.  Differentiate with respect to $M$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial M} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial M} \\left( M r_0 c_0 (\\phi+1) + \\frac{r_0 c' L}{s} + r' c_0 L s + \\frac{r'c'L^2}{2M} \\right) = 0$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial M} = r_0 c_0 (\\phi+1) - \\frac{r'c'L^2}{2M^2} = 0$$\n$$r_0 c_0 (\\phi+1) = \\frac{r'c'L^2}{2M^2} \\implies M^2 = \\frac{r'c'L^2}{2 r_0 c_0 (\\phi+1)}$$\n$$M^{\\star} = L \\sqrt{\\frac{r'c'}{2 r_0 c_0 (\\phi+1)}}$$\n\n### Calculation of Energy Overhead Factor $\\eta^{\\star}$\nThe energy overhead factor is defined as $\\eta \\equiv \\frac{C_{\\text{wire}} + C_{\\text{repeaters}}}{C_{\\text{wire}}}$.\n- Total wire capacitance: $C_{\\text{wire}} = c'L$.\n- Total repeater capacitance: There are $M$ repeaters. Each has a switched input capacitance $c_{\\text{in}} = s c_{0}$ and a switched output parasitic capacitance $c_{\\text{p}} = \\phi s c_{0}$.\n$$C_{\\text{repeaters}} = M (c_{\\text{in}} + c_{\\text{p}}) = M (s c_0 + \\phi s c_0) = M s c_0 (1+\\phi)$$\nSubstituting these into the definition of $\\eta$:\n$$\\eta(M,s) = \\frac{c'L + M s c_0 (1+\\phi)}{c'L} = 1 + \\frac{M s c_0 (1+\\phi)}{c'L}$$\nTo find the optimal energy overhead factor $\\eta^{\\star}$, we substitute the optimal values $M^{\\star}$ and $s^{\\star}$ into this expression. First, let's compute the product $M^{\\star}s^{\\star}$:\n$$M^{\\star} s^{\\star} = \\left( L \\sqrt{\\frac{r'c'}{2 r_0 c_0 (\\phi+1)}} \\right) \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{r_0 c'}{r' c_0}} \\right)$$\n$$M^{\\star} s^{\\star} = L \\sqrt{\\frac{r'c'}{2 r_0 c_0 (\\phi+1)} \\cdot \\frac{r_0 c'}{r' c_0}} = L \\sqrt{\\frac{(c')^2}{2 (c_0)^2 (\\phi+1)}}$$\n$$M^{\\star} s^{\\star} = L \\frac{c'}{c_0} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2(\\phi+1)}}$$\nNow, substitute this product into the expression for $\\eta^{\\star}$:\n$$\\eta^{\\star} = 1 + \\frac{M^{\\star} s^{\\star} c_0 (1+\\phi)}{c'L} = 1 + \\frac{\\left( L \\frac{c'}{c_0} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2(\\phi+1)}} \\right) c_0 (1+\\phi)}{c'L}$$\nCancel terms $L$, $c'$, and $c_0$:\n$$\\eta^{\\star} = 1 + \\frac{1+\\phi}{\\sqrt{2(\\phi+1)}} = 1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{(1+\\phi)^2}}{\\sqrt{2(\\phi+1)}}$$\n$$\\eta^{\\star} = 1 + \\sqrt{\\frac{(1+\\phi)^2}{2(1+\\phi)}} = 1 + \\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\phi}{2}}$$\nThis is the final symbolic expression for the optimal energy overhead factor. It depends only on the parasitic capacitance ratio $\\phi$.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nThe problem provides the numerical value $\\phi = 1.0$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\eta^{\\star}$:\n$$\\eta^{\\star} = 1 + \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.0}{2}} = 1 + \\sqrt{\\frac{2.0}{2}} = 1 + \\sqrt{1.0}$$\n$$\\eta^{\\star} = 1 + 1.0 = 2.0$$\nThe question requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\eta^{\\star} = 2.000$$",
            "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.000}$$"
