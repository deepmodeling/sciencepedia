This first practice challenges you to think like a physical designer, translating a set of abstract design rules and routing constraints into a concrete topological plan.

            "problem": "In a complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor inverter designed as a single standard cell for Electronic Design Automation (EDA) place-and-route flows, assume the following methodology and design-rule environment. Metal-1 (M1) is constrained to be unidirectional and horizontal inside the cell body, while Metal-2 (M2) is unidirectional and vertical. The minimum Metal-1 width is $W_{\\text{M1}} = 2\\lambda$ and the minimum Metal-1 spacing is $S_{\\text{M1}} = 2\\lambda$, with $\\lambda$ denoting the scalable design-rule unit. A track is defined by the centerline pitch $P_{\\text{M1}}$ of horizontally routed M1 lines, and all M1 pin shapes must be centered on integer track indices. The standard-cell methodology requires that the power rails $V_{\\text{DD}}$ and $V_{\\text{SS}}$ be implemented as continuous M1 lines at the very top and bottom of the cell, respectively, each occupying exactly one track. The input pin $A$ must be exposed as an M1 pin shape reachable by a single M1–M2 via from the vertical polysilicon gate using a poly–metal contact, and the output pin $Y$ must short the p-type metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor drain and the n-type metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor drain; that short must be realized by a vertical M2 segment internal to the cell connecting two distinct M1 pin shapes, one landing on each drain diffusion through contacts. Vertical M1 jogs in the cell body are not permitted; only horizontal M1 segments on discrete tracks are allowed. You may place multiple disjoint nets on the same M1 track provided they are laterally separated along the $x$ direction and satisfy the minimum spacing $S_{\\text{M1}}$, but any M1–M2 via landing pad must be centered on some M1 track.\n\nStarting from the core geometric facts that an M1 track grid arises from the minimum width and spacing requirements, and from the above standard-cell unidirectional routing constraints, determine the minimum number of distinct horizontal M1 tracks across the cell height that are necessary and sufficient to implement the inverter with accessible pins $A$, $Y$, $V_{\\text{DD}}$, and $V_{\\text{SS}}$ as specified. In your reasoning, account for the need to provide two separate M1 landing locations for the two drains that form $Y$ and for the prohibition of vertical M1 jogs. You must ensure that all M1 features meet $W_{\\text{M1}}$ and $S_{\\text{M1}}$ and that every M1–M2 via is centered on an M1 track.\n\nProvide, in words, a stick-diagram-consistent routing plan that attains this minimum under the stated methodology. Finally, report the minimum track count as a single integer. No rounding is required, and no physical units should be reported for the final answer. All numerical quantities in your derivation must be treated symbolically in terms of $\\lambda$ except for the final track count, which must be a number.",
            "solution": "The objective is to find the minimum number of horizontal Metal-1 (M1) tracks required to implement a CMOS inverter standard cell according to the specified rules. A track is a discrete horizontal routing channel, and the total number of tracks determines the height of the standard cell.\n\nFirst, we must identify all distinct electrical nets that require M1 routing resources within the cell. For a CMOS inverter, these are:\n1.  The power supply rail, $V_{\\text{DD}}$.\n2.  The ground rail, $V_{\\text{SS}}$.\n3.  The input signal, $A$.\n4.  The output signal, $Y$.\n\nNext, we analyze the constraints imposed on the M1 layout for each of these nets.\n\n1.  **Power Rails ($V_{\\text{DD}}$ and $V_{\\text{SS}}$)**: The problem states that $V_{\\text{DD}}$ and $V_{\\text{SS}}$ must be implemented as continuous M1 lines at the very top and bottom of the cell, respectively. It is also specified that each of these rails occupies exactly one track. Therefore, these two power rails require two dedicated M1 tracks that cannot be shared with any other signal routing. Let us denote the top track as Track $N$ for $V_{\\text{DD}}$ and the bottom track as Track $1$ for $V_{\\text{SS}}$. This establishes an immediate requirement for at least two tracks.\n\n2.  **Output Pin ($Y$)**: The most critical constraint concerns the output pin $Y$. The problem specifies that the output net must short the drain of the p-type transistor (PMOS) and the drain of the n-type transistor (NMOS). This short \"must be realized by a vertical M2 segment internal to the cell connecting two distinct M1 pin shapes\". Let us call the M1 landing pad connected to the PMOS drain $Y_p$ and the M1 landing pad connected to the NMOS drain $Y_n$.\n    - The M2 layer is constrained to be unidirectional and vertical. A vertical line segment is defined by a constant $x$-coordinate and a varying $y$-coordinate.\n    - The M1 layer is constrained to be unidirectional and horizontal. A horizontal M1 track is defined by a constant $y$-coordinate.\n    - For a vertical M2 segment to connect the two M1 shapes, $Y_p$ and $Y_n$, these two shapes must be placed at the same $x$-coordinate but at different $y$-coordinates.\n    - Since M1 shapes must be centered on horizontal tracks, having different $y$-coordinates implies that $Y_p$ and $Y_n$ must be placed on two different M1 tracks.\n    - Therefore, the implementation of the output pin $Y$ requires a minimum of two distinct M1 tracks. These tracks must be internal to the cell, i.e., they lie between the $V_{\\text{DD}}$ and $V_{\\text{SS}}$ rails.\n\nCombining the requirements for the power rails and the output pin, we have a minimum of $2$ tracks for power ($V_{\\text{DD}}$, $V_{\\text{SS}}$) plus $2$ tracks for the output ($Y_p$, $Y_n$), leading to a preliminary lower bound of $4$ tracks.\n\n3.  **Input Pin ($A$)**: The problem specifies that \"the input pin A must be exposed as an M1 pin shape\". This M1 shape must be connected to the inverter's polysilicon gate. Like all other M1 features, this shape must be centered on an M1 track. This adds a requirement for one M1 track to accommodate the input pin. The question now becomes whether this track must be additional to the four already identified, or if it can be shared.\n\nThe problem states: \"You may place multiple disjoint nets on the same M1 track provided they are laterally separated along the $x$ direction\". The input net $A$ is electrically disjoint from the output net $Y$. In a typical inverter layout, the polysilicon gate is a vertical structure that is physically separated in the $x$-direction from the drain diffusion areas. This means that an M1 contact to the gate (for pin $A$) will have a different $x$-coordinate than the M1 contacts to the drains (for $Y_p$ and $Y_n$). Consequently, it is possible to place the M1 shape for pin $A$ on the same horizontal track as either $Y_p$ or $Y_n$, while respecting the lateral separation rule ($S_{\\text{M1}} = 2\\lambda$).\n\nTo achieve the minimum track count, we should attempt to share tracks where possible. Since the input pin $A$ requires an M1 resource that can be placed on the same track as another M1 shape, it does not necessitate an additional track. We can place the M1 shape for pin $A$ on one of the two internal tracks already required for the output $Y$.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of tracks required is $4$. A feasible layout plan demonstrating this minimum is as follows:\n\n-   **Track 4 (Topmost):** A continuous M1 horizontal wire for the $V_{\\text{DD}}$ rail. This rail makes contact with the PMOS source diffusion region.\n-   **Track 3:** One M1 horizontal segment serving as the landing pad for the PMOS drain ($Y_p$). On this same track, but at a different lateral ($x$) position, a second M1 segment serves as the input pin $A$, making contact with the underlying vertical polysilicon gate.\n-   **Track 2:** One M1 horizontal segment serving as the landing pad for the NMOS drain ($Y_n$). This segment is placed at the same $x$-coordinate as the $Y_p$ segment on Track 3.\n-   **Track 1 (Bottommost):** A continuous M1 horizontal wire for the $V_{\\text{SS}}$ rail. This rail makes contact with the NMOS source diffusion region.\n\nThe output connection is completed by a vertical M2 segment running between the M1 segment $Y_p$ on Track 3 and the M1 segment $Y_n$ on Track 2. This structure satisfies all specified constraints: M1 is horizontal, M2 is vertical, power rails are on the top and bottom tracks, the output $Y$ is formed by a vertical short between M1 pads on two distinct tracks, and the input pin $A$ exists as an M1 shape on an integer track. No vertical M1 jogs are used. The minimum number of tracks is thus established to be $4$.",

For the pull-up network, assume each $p$-channel transistor has width $W_{p1} = W_{p2} = 2$ (equal to the inverter $p$-channel width), a common practical choice when adhering to identical stick heights and maintaining strong pull-up, and the two $p$-channel drains are merged at the output by diffusion sharing into a single diffusion stripe of width $W_{p1} + W_{p2} = 4$.\n\nModel the intrinsic output diffusion capacitance of a gate as a sum of area and sidewall contributions from the output-connected diffusion rectangles.

Analysis of the Unit Inverter (INV)**\n\nThe unit inverter has transistor widths $W_{n} = 1$ and $W_{p} = 2$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the input capacitance of the unit inverter, $C_{\\text{in,INV}}$. This serves as the reference capacitance for the logical effort model.

The Elmore delay at a node $i$ in an $RC$ tree is given by $\\tau_i = \\sum_{k} R_{ik} C_k$, where the sum is over all capacitors $C_k$ in the network, and $R_{ik}$ is the resistance of the path from the voltage source to node $i$ that is common with the path to capacitor $C_k$.\n\nIn our model, the output node is at the end of the interconnect, at a distance $L$ from the driver. The network consists of a source resistance $R_{\\mathrm{drv}}$, a distributed $RC$ line of total resistance $R_{\\mathrm{line}} = rL$ and total capacitance $C_{\\mathrm{line}} = cL$, and a lumped load capacitance $C_g$. The per-unit-length resistance is $r = R_{\\mathrm{sheet}}/w$.\n\nWe can find the total delay by summing the contributions from the distributed line capacitance and the lumped load capacitance.\n\n1.  Contribution from the lumped load capacitance $C_g$: The capacitor $C_g$ is at the end of the line ($x=L$). The entire resistance path from the source to $C_g$ is common to the path to the output node. This resistance is $R_{\\mathrm{path}} = R_{\\mathrm{drv}} + rL$. The delay contribution is thus $(R_{\\mathrm{drv}} + rL)C_g$.\n\n2.  Contribution from the distributed line capacitance: Consider an infinitesimal segment of the line of length $dx$ at a position $x$ from the driver. This segment has a capacitance $dC = c \\cdot dx$. The resistance path from the source to this infinitesimal capacitor is $R_{sx} = R_{\\mathrm{drv}} + rx$. This entire path is common to the path to the output node at $x=L$. Therefore, the delay contribution from this infinitesimal capacitance is $R_{sx} \\cdot dC = (R_{\\mathrm{drv}} + rx)c \\cdot dx$. To find the total contribution from the entire line, we integrate this expression from $x=0$ to $x=L$:\n$$ \\int_0^L (R_{\\mathrm{drv}} + rx)c \\cdot dx = c \\int_0^L (R_{\\mathrm{drv}} + rx)dx = c \\left[ R_{\\mathrm{drv}}x + \\frac{1}{2}rx^2 \\right]_0^L = c R_{\\mathrm{drv}}L + \\frac{1}{2}rcL^2 $$\n\nThe total Elmore delay $t$ at the end of the interconnect is the sum of these two contributions:\n$$ t = (R_{\\mathrm{drv}} + rL)C_g + cR_{\\mathrm{drv}}L + \\frac{1}{2}rcL^2 $$\n\nNumerical Calculation\n\nFirst, we calculate the per-unit-length resistance $r$:\n$$ r = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{sheet}}}{w} = \\frac{0.08\\ \\Omega}{0.5\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}} = 0.16\\ \\Omega/\\mu\\mathrm{m} $$\n\nNow, we apply the delay formula for path A ($L_A = 800\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$) and path B ($L_B = 200\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$).

The calculated skew, $\\Delta t = 69.8\\ \\mathrm{ps}$, is significant and can cause such a hazard in the $NAND2$ gate.\n\nLet's analyze a specific input transition that should produce a constant output but may not due to the skew. The logic function is $Y = \\overline{A \\cdot B}$. A static-1 hazard can occur when the output is supposed to remain at logic '$1$', but momentarily drops to '$0$'. This can happen for an input change like $(A,B)$ from $(1,0)$ to $(0,1)$.\n- Ideal case (no skew): Initial state is $A=1, B=0$, so $Y=\\overline{1 \\cdot 0} = \\overline{0} = 1$. Final state is $A=0, B=1$, so $Y=\\overline{0 \\cdot 1} = \\overline{0} = 1$. The output $Y$ should remain high.\n\n- Real case (with skew $t_A > t_B$):\nThe physical structure of a $CMOS$ $NAND2$ gate consists of a pull-up network ($PUN$) with two $p$-channel ($PMOS$) transistors in parallel between the output $Y$ and the supply voltage $V_{DD}$, and a pull-down network ($PDN$) with two $n$-channel ($NMOS$) transistors in series between $Y$ and ground ($GND$).\nLet's trace the state of the transistors for the transition $(A, B): (1,0) \\to (0,1)$, assuming the signals at the driver outputs change at time $t=0$. Due to the interconnect delay, the signal at the gate's input $B$ will transition at $t \\approx t_B$, and the signal at input $A$ will transition at $t \\approx t_A$.\n\n1.  Time $t  t_B$: The gate inputs are $(A_g, B_g) = (1,0)$.\n    - $PUN$: The $PMOS$ for $A_g=1$ is OFF. The $PMOS$ for $B_g=0$ is ON. Since they are in parallel, the $PUN$ is ON, pulling $Y$ to $V_{DD}$ (logic $1$).\n    - $PDN$: The $NMOS$ for $A_g=1$ is ON. The $NMOS$ for $B_g=0$ is OFF. Since they are in series, the $PDN$ is OFF.\n    - Output $Y = 1$.\n\n2.  Time $t_B \\le t  t_A$: The faster signal $B$ has arrived, but $A$ has not. The gate inputs are $(A_g, B_g) = (1,1)$.\n    - $PUN$: The $PMOS$ for $A_g=1$ is OFF. The $PMOS$ for $B_g=1$ is OFF. The $PUN$ is now OFF.\n    - $PDN$: The $NMOS$ for $A_g=1$ is ON. The $NMOS$ for $B_g=1$ is ON. The $PDN$ is now ON, creating a conducting path from $Y$ to $GND$.\n    - During this interval, the $PUN$ is open and the $PDN$ is closed. The output node $Y$ is discharged towards $GND$. The output voltage drops, creating a glitch towards logic $0$.\n\n3.  Time $t \\ge t_A$: The slower signal $A$ has now arrived. The gate inputs are $(A_g, B_g) = (0,1)$.\n    - $PUN$: The $PMOS$ for $A_g=0$ is ON. The $PMOS$ for $B_g=1$ is OFF. The $PUN$ is ON, pulling $Y$ back up to $V_{DD}$ (logic $1$).\n    - $PDN$: The $NMOS$ for $A_g=0$ is OFF. The $NMOS$ for $B_g=1$ is ON. The $PDN$ is OFF.\n    - Output $Y = 1$.\n\nThe overall behavior of the output $Y$ is a $1 \\to 0 \\to 1$ pulse, a glitch. The duration of this glitch is approximately the skew $\\Delta t = t_A - t_B$. If $\\Delta t$ is larger than the gate's intrinsic inertial delay, this glitch will be a full-swing voltage drop and can propagate to subsequent logic stages, potentially causing erroneous state changes in sequential circuits like latches or flip-flops. The computed skew of $69.8\\ \\mathrm{ps}$ is a substantial fraction of a clock cycle in modern high-speed designs and is more than sufficient to cause such a harmful glitch.",
