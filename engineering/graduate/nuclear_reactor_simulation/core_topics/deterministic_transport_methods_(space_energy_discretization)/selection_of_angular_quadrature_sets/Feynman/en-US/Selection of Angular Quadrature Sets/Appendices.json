A widely used angular quadrature on the sphere is the level-symmetric family, in which, in each octant, the abscissae are arranged in levels that are symmetric under permutation of the coordinate axes.\n\nConsider constructing a level-symmetric set with two polar levels in the first octant for a so-called $LS_4$ quadrature. In the first octant, for each level $l \\in \\{1,2\\}$, define three directions as the permutations of the triplet $(u_l, v_l, v_l)$, where $u_l \\in (0,1)$ and $v_l \\in (0,1)$ are direction cosines such that the direction vector has unit length.
