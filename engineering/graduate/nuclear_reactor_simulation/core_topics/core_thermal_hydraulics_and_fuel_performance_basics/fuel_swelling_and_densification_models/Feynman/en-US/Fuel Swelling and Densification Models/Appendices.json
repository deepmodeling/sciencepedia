This approach is expected to be valid when:\n1.  The total accumulated strain is small (typically $\\epsilon \\ll 1$), which is consistent with the problem's assumption.\n2.  The material response is predominantly elastic, or any inelastic deformation (like plasticity or creep) is negligible. The problem's condition of being \"free of external mechanical constraints\" helps in this regard by preventing the buildup of large primary stresses.\n3.  The physical mechanisms are uncoupled. That is, the coefficient of thermal expansion is not significantly affected by the irradiation dose, and the swelling rate is not a strong function of the mechanical stress state.\n\nThis superposition may break down in more realistic reactor fuel scenarios where:\n1.  Large strain gradients exist, such as the steep thermal gradient across a fuel pellet from its hot centerline to cooler periphery. These gradients induce internal stresses.\n2.  These internal stresses are large enough to cause significant inelastic deformation, such as irradiation-enhanced thermal creep. Creep and plastic strains are path-dependent and intrinsically coupled with the stress, temperature, and irradiation history, invalidating a simple additive model.\n3.  At high burnup, material properties can evolve significantly, and phenomena such as stress-directed swelling can create a feedback loop between the mechanical state and the swelling behavior, violating the uncoupled assumption.\nIn such complex cases, a coupled thermo-mechanical analysis using constitutive laws that account for plasticity, creep, and evolving material properties is required.",

The analysis will culminate in a computational implementation to calculate the axial stress for a given set of test cases.\n\n### **1. Model Formulation and Derivation of Axial Stress**\n\nThe foundation of the model rests on the principle of strain decomposition in small-strain theory. The total axial strain, $ \\epsilon $, is the linear superposition of the mechanical strain, $ \\epsilon_{\\text{mech}} $, which generates stress, and the non-mechanical eigenstrains, $ \\epsilon_{\\ast} $.\n$$ \\epsilon = \\epsilon_{\\text{mech}} + \\epsilon_{\\ast} $$\nThe eigenstrain is the sum of contributions from fuel swelling, densification, and thermal expansion:\n$$ \\epsilon_{\\ast} = \\epsilon_{\\text{sw}} + \\epsilon_{\\text{dens}} + \\epsilon_{\\text{th}} $$\nThe mechanical response is governed by Hooke's law for a linear elastic material, relating the axial stress $ \\sigma $ to the mechanical strain via the temperature-dependent Young's modulus, $ E(T) $.\n$$ \\sigma = E(T) \\, \\epsilon_{\\text{mech}} $$\nBy rearranging Hooke's law, we can express the mechanical strain as $ \\epsilon_{\\text{mech}} = \\sigma / E(T) $. Substituting this into the strain decomposition gives a constitutive relation for the total strain in terms of stress and eigenstrain:\n$$ \\epsilon = \\frac{\\sigma}{E(T)} + \\epsilon_{\\ast} $$\nNext, we apply principles of static equilibrium and kinematic compatibility to incorporate the boundary conditions. The fuel segment is modeled as a prismatic bar of length $ L $ and cross-sectional area $ A $. Its left end is fixed, and its right end is attached to a linear spring of stiffness $ K $.\nThe total elongation of the bar, $ \\Delta L $, is given by the total strain:\n$$ \\Delta L = \\epsilon L = L \\left( \\frac{\\sigma}{E(T)} + \\epsilon_{\\ast} \\right) $$\nFor static equilibrium, the internal tensile force in the bar, $ F_{\\text{bar}} = \\sigma A $, must be balanced by the reaction force from the spring. An elongation $ \\Delta L $ of the bar compresses the spring, generating a compressive reaction force on the bar. The force from the spring on the bar is $ F_{\\text{spring}} = -K \\Delta L $.\nEquating the forces, $ F_{\\text{bar}} = F_{\\text{spring}} $, yields:\n$$ \\sigma A = -K \\Delta L $$\nSubstituting the expression for $ \\Delta L $:\n$$ \\sigma A = -K \\left[ L \\left( \\frac{\\sigma}{E(T)} + \\epsilon_{\\ast} \\right) \\right] $$\nWe now solve this equation for the unknown stress, $ \\sigma $:\n$$ \\sigma A = -K L \\epsilon_{\\ast} - \\frac{K L \\sigma}{E(T)} $$\n$$ \\sigma A + \\frac{K L \\sigma}{E(T)} = -K L \\epsilon_{\\ast} $$\n$$ \\sigma \\left( A + \\frac{K L}{E(T)} \\right) = -K L \\epsilon_{\\ast} $$\nThis yields the final expression for the axial stress:\n$$ \\sigma = \\frac{-K L \\epsilon_{\\ast}}{A + \\frac{K L}{E(T)}} $$\nThis single equation encapsulates the entire thermo-mechanical response of the system. A positive (expansive) eigenstrain $ \\epsilon_{\\ast} > 0 $ results in a negative (compressive) stress $ \\sigma < 0 $, as expected from the physical constraint.\n\n### **2. Calculation of Model Components**\n\nTo compute the stress $ \\sigma $, we must first evaluate each term in the governing equation using the provided constitutive models and constants.\n\n**Temperature-Dependent Young's Modulus $ E(T) $:**\n$$ E(T) = E_0 \\left[ 1 - m (T - T_{\\text{ref}}) \\right] $$\nwith constants $ E_0 = 2.0 \\times 10^{11} \\ \\text{Pa} $, $ m = 2.5 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\text{K}^{-1} $, and $ T_{\\text{ref}} = 293 \\ \\text{K} $.\n\n**Thermal Strain $ \\epsilon_{\\text{th}}(T) $:**\n$$ \\epsilon_{\\text{th}}(T) = \\alpha(T) (T - T_{\\text{ref}}) $$\nwhere the linear thermal expansion coefficient $ \\alpha(T) $ is itself temperature-dependent:\n$$ \\alpha(T) = a_0 + a_1 (T - T_{\\text{ref}}) $$\nwith constants $ a_0 = 6.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{K}^{-1} $ and $ a_1 = 5.0 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\text{K}^{-2} $.\n\n**Swelling Strain $ \\epsilon_{\\text{sw}}(B) $:**\n$$ \\epsilon_{\\text{sw}}(B) = s_{\\max} \\left( 1 - e^{-k_s B} \\right) $$\nwith constants $ s_{\\max} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3} $ and $ k_s = 3.0 \\times 10^{-2} \\ (\\text{MWd/kgU})^{-1} $.\n\n**Densification Strain $ \\epsilon_{\\text{dens}}(P_0, t, T) $:**\nThis strain results from the reduction of initial porosity $ P_0 $. The porosity at time $ t $, $ P(t) $, is given by:\n$$ P(t) = P_0 \\exp\\left(-k_{d0} e^{-Q/(R T)} t\\right) $$\nThe axial strain is one-third of the volumetric strain, which is the change in porosity:\n$$ \\epsilon_{\\text{dens}}(P_0, t, T) = -\\frac{1}{3} \\left( P_0 - P(t) \\right) $$\nwith constants $ k_{d0} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{s}^{-1} $, $ Q = 6.0 \\times 10^{4} \\ \\text{J/mol} $, and $ R = 8.314 \\ \\text{J/(mol\\cdot K)} $.\n\n### **3. Algorithmic Solution for Test Cases**\n\nThe solution proceeds by implementing the derived formulas for each test case.\n\n**For each test case with parameters $ (B, T, t, P_0, A, L, K) $:**\n1.  Calculate the temperature-dependent Young's modulus, $ E(T) $.\n2.  For Case $ 3 $, where the spring stiffness is defined as $ K = E(T) A / L $, this calculated value of $ E(T) $ is used to determine $ K $. For all other cases, the provided value of $ K $ is used directly.\n3.  Calculate the individual eigenstrain components: $ \\epsilon_{\\text{th}}(T) $, $ \\epsilon_{\\text{sw}}(B) $, and $ \\epsilon_{\\text{dens}}(P_0, t, T) $.\n4.  Sum the components to find the total eigenstrain: $ \\epsilon_{\\ast} = \\epsilon_{\\text{th}} + \\epsilon_{\\text{sw}} + \\epsilon_{\\text{dens}} $.\n5.  Substitute all calculated values ($ E(T), \\epsilon_{\\ast} $) and given parameters ($ K, L, A $) into the final stress equation to compute $ \\sigma $ in Pascals.\n    - If $ K = 0 $ (Case 1), the numerator is zero, yielding $ \\sigma = 0 \\ \\text{Pa} $, correctly representing free expansion.\n    - If $ \\epsilon_{\\ast} = 0 $ (Case 4), the numerator is zero, yielding $ \\sigma = 0 \\ \\text{Pa} $, correctly representing a zero-stress state with no driving strain.\n6.  Convert the final stress from Pascals (Pa) to Megapascals (MPa) by dividing by $ 10^6 $.\n7.  The results for all four cases are collected and formatted as a single-line string.\n\nThis systematic application of the derived model to the specified test cases provides the required numerical solution.",
