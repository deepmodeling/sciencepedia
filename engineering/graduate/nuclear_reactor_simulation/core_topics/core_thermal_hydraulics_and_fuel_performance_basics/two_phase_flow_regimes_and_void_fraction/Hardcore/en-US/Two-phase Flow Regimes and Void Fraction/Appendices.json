The definitions of mass quality and void fraction are standard. All concepts are well-established within physics and engineering. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary definitions ($\\alpha$, $x$, $\\rho_g$, $\\rho_l$) and a clear set of assumptions (HEM) to derive a unique relationship between the variables. The task is unambiguous and a unique solution is known to exist.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, technical terminology. It is free of subjectivity, opinion, or non-scientific claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a standard derivation in thermal–hydraulics. The solution process will proceed.\n\nThe objective is to derive a relationship between the void fraction, $\\alpha$, and the mass quality, $x$. We begin with the fundamental definitions provided.\n\nThe void fraction, $\\alpha$, is the ratio of the vapor volume, $V_g$, to the total volume, $V_{total} = V_g + V_l$:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{V_g}{V_g + V_l} $$\n\nThe mass quality, $x$, is the ratio of the vapor mass, $m_g$, to the total mass, $m_{total} = m_g + m_l$:\n$$ x = \\frac{m_g}{m_g + m_l} $$\n\nFrom the definition of quality, we can also express the liquid mass fraction as:\n$$ 1-x = \\frac{m_g + m_l - m_g}{m_g + m_l} = \\frac{m_l}{m_g + m_l} $$\n\nThe connection between mass and volume for each phase is given by the respective phase densities, $\\rho_g$ and $\\rho_l$:\n$$ m_g = \\rho_g V_g \\implies V_g = \\frac{m_g}{\\rho_g} $$\n$$ m_l = \\rho_l V_l \\implies V_l = \\frac{m_l}{\\rho_l} $$\n\nWe can substitute these expressions for volume into the definition of the void fraction:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{\\frac{m_g}{\\rho_g}}{\\frac{m_g}{\\rho_g} + \\frac{m_l}{\\rho_l}} $$\n\nTo introduce the quality, $x$, we can divide the numerator and denominator by the total mass, $m_{total} = m_g + m_l$:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{\\frac{m_g / m_{total}}{\\rho_g}}{\\frac{m_g / m_{total}}{\\rho_g} + \\frac{m_l / m_{total}}{\\rho_l}} $$\n\nRecognizing that $\\frac{m_g}{m_{total}} = x$ and $\\frac{m_l}{m_{total}} = 1-x$, we can substitute these into the equation:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{\\frac{x}{\\rho_g}}{\\frac{x}{\\rho_g} + \\frac{1-x}{\\rho_l}} $$\n\nThis expression relates $\\alpha$ to $x$, $\\rho_g$, and $\\rho_l$ as required. It can be algebraically rearranged into several common forms. To obtain a structured form, we can simplify the complex fraction. Multiplying the numerator and denominator by $\\rho_g \\rho_l$ yields:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{\\frac{x}{\\rho_g} (\\rho_g \\rho_l)}{(\\frac{x}{\\rho_g} + \\frac{1-x}{\\rho_l}) (\\rho_g \\rho_l)} = \\frac{x \\rho_l}{x \\rho_l + (1-x) \\rho_g} $$\n\nAn alternative, and often more insightful, form is obtained by dividing the numerator and denominator of the complex fraction by the numerator's term, $\\frac{x}{\\rho_g}$:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{(1-x)/\\rho_l}{x/\\rho_g}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1-x}{x} \\frac{\\rho_g}{\\rho_l}} $$\nThis final form is the desired expression. The HEM assumption of equal phase velocities ($u_g = u_l$) ensures that the quality defined by mass flow rates ($\\dot{m}_g / \\dot{m}_{total}$) is identical to the static quality ($m_g / m_{total}$) used in this derivation, thus making the result applicable to the specified flow problem.\n\nNext, we analyze the limiting behavior of this expression in the asymptotic regime where the density ratio $\\frac{\\rho_g}{\\rho_l} \\to 0$. This limit is physically relevant for gas-liquid systems far from the critical point, where the liquid is significantly denser than the vapor. The quality $x$ is held fixed such that $0  x  1$.\n\nWe take the limit of the derived expression for $\\alpha$:\n$$ \\lim_{\\frac{\\rho_g}{\\rho_l} \\to 0} \\alpha = \\lim_{\\frac{\\rho_g}{\\rho_l} \\to 0} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1-x}{x} \\frac{\\rho_g}{\\rho_l}} \\right) $$\nSince $x$ is a fixed value between $0$ and $1$, the term $\\frac{1-x}{x}$ is a finite, positive constant. As $\\frac{\\rho_g}{\\rho_l} \\to 0$, the product term in the denominator approaches zero:\n$$ \\frac{1-x}{x} \\frac{\\rho_g}{\\rho_l} \\to 0 $$\nTherefore, the limit of the void fraction is:\n$$ \\lim_{\\frac{\\rho_g}{\\rho_l} \\to 0} \\alpha = \\frac{1}{1 + 0} = 1 $$\n\nFinally, we explain the physical interpretation of this result. The limit $\\alpha \\to 1$ means that the volume of the channel becomes almost entirely occupied by the vapor phase, even for a very small but non-zero mass quality $x$. This occurs because quality is a mass-based fraction, while void fraction is a volume-based fraction.\nIf the vapor density $\\rho_g$ is extremely small compared to the liquid density $\\rho_l$, then even a small mass of vapor $m_g$ will occupy a very large volume $V_g = \\frac{m_g}{\\rho_g}$. In contrast, the much larger mass of liquid $m_l$ will occupy a comparatively small and finite volume $V_l = \\frac{m_l}{\\rho_l}$.\nIn the expression $\\alpha = \\frac{V_g}{V_g + V_l}$, as $\\frac{\\rho_g}{\\rho_l} \\to 0$ for a fixed $x0$, $V_g$ becomes disproportionately larger than $V_l$, causing their sum $V_g+V_l$ to be dominated by $V_g$. Consequently, the ratio approaches $1$.\n\nIn the context of a BWR, this result is of paramount importance. At typical operating pressures, the density of liquid water is much greater than that of steam ($\\rho_l \\gg \\rho_g$). The analysis shows that as soon as boiling commences ($x0$), the steam voids rapidly occupy a large fraction of the flow channel volume. This has two critical effects:\n1.  **Neutron Moderation:** Liquid water acts as the neutron moderator. A high void fraction ($\\alpha \\approx 1$) signifies a large displacement of this liquid moderator by steam. This reduction in moderation lowers the rate of fission reactions. This phenomenon gives BWRs a negative void coefficient of reactivity, a key inherent safety feature that causes the reactor to reduce its power output if it begins to overheat and produce too much steam.\n2.  **Thermal-Hydraulic Performance:** A high void fraction drastically alters the flow regime, increases pressure drop, and changes the heat transfer characteristics from the fuel rod surface to the coolant. Accurately predicting the void fraction is thus essential for calculating thermal margins and ensuring the safe operation of the reactor, preventing conditions like Critical Heat Flux (CHF) that could lead to fuel damage.\n\nThe limit mathematically demonstrates a core principle of two-phase flow: in systems with large density differences, the volume is dominated by the light phase, while the mass can be dominated by the heavy phase.",

Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Void Fraction Expression\nThe drift-flux model, as formulated by Zuber and Findlay, relates the area-averaged actual velocity of the gas phase, $\\langle u_g \\rangle$, to the area-averaged total volumetric flux (or mixture velocity), $j$, and the drift velocity, $V_{gj}$. The distribution parameter, $C_0$, accounts for the non-uniform radial distributions of void and velocity. The relationship is:\n$$ \\langle u_g \\rangle = C_{0} j + V_{gj} $$\nBy definition, the gas superficial velocity, $j_g$, is related to the void fraction, $\\alpha$, and the actual gas velocity, $\\langle u_g \\rangle$, by the identity:\n$$ j_g = \\alpha \\langle u_g \\rangle $$\nThis identity arises from the fundamental definitions: $j_g = Q_g / A_{total}$, $\\alpha = A_g / A_{total}$, and $\\langle u_g \\rangle = Q_g / A_g$, where $Q_g$ is the volumetric flow rate of the gas phase, $A_g$ is the area occupied by the gas, and $A_{total}$ is the total cross-sectional area.\n\nTo find an expression for $\\alpha$, we first express $\\langle u_g \\rangle$ from the second equation as $\\langle u_g \\rangle = j_g / \\alpha$. We then substitute this into the drift-flux equation:\n$$ \\frac{j_g}{\\alpha} = C_{0} j + V_{gj} $$\nSolving this equation for the void fraction $\\alpha$ by inverting the expression yields:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{j_g}{C_{0} j + V_{gj}} $$\nThis is the desired expression for the void fraction in terms of the given parameters.\n\n### Evaluation for Regime A\nThe given parameters for Regime A are $j = 2.4$, $j_g = 0.06$, $C_0 = 1.20$, and $V_{gj} = 0.20$.\nThe void fraction, $\\alpha_{\\text{A}}$, is calculated as:\n$$ \\alpha_{\\text{A}} = \\frac{0.06}{1.20 \\times 2.4 + 0.20} = \\frac{0.06}{2.88 + 0.20} = \\frac{0.06}{3.08} \\approx 0.0194805... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\alpha_{\\text{A}} = 0.01948$.\n\n### Evaluation for Regime B\nThe given parameters for Regime B are $j = 2.4$, $j_g = 0.06$, $C_0 = 1.40$, and $V_{gj} = 0.45$.\nThe void fraction, $\\alpha_{\\text{B}}$, is calculated as:\n$$ \\alpha_{\\text{B}} = \\frac{0.06}{1.40 \\times 2.4 + 0.45} = \\frac{0.06}{3.36 + 0.45} = \\frac{0.06}{3.81} \\approx 0.0157480... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\alpha_{\\text{B}} = 0.01575$.\n\n### Derivation of the Sensitivity Expression\nThe sensitivity of $\\alpha$ to $C_0$ is defined as the partial derivative $\\partial \\alpha / \\partial C_0$, holding $j$, $j_g$, and $V_{gj}$ constant.

The variance, $\\sigma_S^2$, is given by the formula for propagation of uncertainty, assuming zero covariances:\n$$\\sigma_S^2 = \\sum_i \\left( \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial x_i} \\right)^2 \\sigma_{x_i}^2$$\nFor our function $S = S(\\alpha, j_g, j_l)$, this expands to:\n$$\\sigma_S^2 = \\left( \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial j_g} \\right)^2 \\sigma_{j_g}^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial j_l} \\right)^2 \\sigma_{j_l}^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\alpha} \\right)^2 \\sigma_{\\alpha}^2$$\nWe must compute the partial derivatives of $S = \\frac{j_g(1-\\alpha)}{j_l\\alpha}$ with respect to each variable, evaluated at the mean values of the variables.\n\nThe partial derivative with respect to $j_g$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial j_g} = \\frac{1-\\alpha}{j_l \\alpha}$$\nThe partial derivative with respect to $j_l$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial j_l} = -\\frac{j_g(1-\\alpha)}{j_l^2 \\alpha}$$\nThe partial derivative with respect to $\\alpha$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\alpha} = \\frac{j_g}{j_l} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\alpha} \\left( \\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha} \\right) = \\frac{j_g}{j_l} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\alpha} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\alpha} - 1 \\right) = \\frac{j_g}{j_l} \\left( -\\frac{1}{\\alpha^2} \\right) = -\\frac{j_g}{j_l \\alpha^2}$$\nSubstituting these partial derivatives into the variance formula:\n$$\\sigma_S^2 = \\left( \\frac{1-\\alpha}{j_l \\alpha} \\right)^2 \\sigma_{j_g}^2 + \\left( -\\frac{j_g(1-\\alpha)}{j_l^2 \\alpha} \\right)^2 \\sigma_{j_l}^2 + \\left( -\\frac{j_g}{j_l \\alpha^2} \\right)^2 \\sigma_{\\alpha}^2$$\nThis expression is the analytic form for the variance. It is often more insightful to express this in terms of relative uncertainties. By dividing by $S^2 = \\left( \\frac{j_g(1-\\alpha)}{j_l\\alpha} \\right)^2$, we obtain the square of the relative uncertainty in $S$:\n$$\\left( \\frac{\\sigma_S}{S} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_{j_g}}{j_g} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_{j_l}}{j_l} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{j_l^2 \\alpha^2}{j_g^2(1-\\alpha)^2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{j_g^2}{j_l^2 \\alpha^4} \\right) \\sigma_{\\alpha}^2$$\n$$\\left( \\frac{\\sigma_S}{S} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_{j_g}}{j_g} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_{j_l}}{j_l} \\right)^2 + \\frac{\\sigma_{\\alpha}^2}{\\alpha^2(1-\\alpha)^2} = \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_{j_g}}{j_g} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_{j_l}}{j_l} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_{\\alpha}}{\\alpha(1-\\alpha)} \\right)^2$$\nFrom this, the analytic expression for the standard uncertainty $\\sigma_S$ is:\n$$\\sigma_S = S \\sqrt{ \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_{j_g}}{j_g} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_{j_l}}{j_l} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_{\\alpha}}{\\alpha(1-\\alpha)} \\right)^2 }$$\nSubstituting the expression for $S$:\n$$\\sigma_S = \\left( \\frac{j_g(1-\\alpha)}{j_l \\alpha} \\right) \\sqrt{ \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_{j_g}}{j_g} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_{j_l}}{j_l} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_{\\alpha}}{\\alpha(1-\\alpha)} \\right)^2 }$$\n\nPart 3: Numerical evaluation of $\\sigma_S$.\nWe are given the mean values and standard uncertainties:\n$\\bar{\\alpha} = 0.35$, $\\sigma_{\\alpha} = 0.02$\n$\\bar{j}_g = 0.80 \\, \\mathrm{m/s}$, $\\sigma_{j_g} = 0.05 \\, \\mathrm{m/s}$\n$\\bar{j}_l = 1.20 \\, \\mathrm{m/s}$, $\\sigma_{j_l} = 0.05 \\, \\mathrm{m/s}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the mean slip ratio, $\\bar{S}$, using the mean values of the measured quantities:\n$$\\bar{S} = \\frac{\\bar{j}_g(1-\\bar{\\alpha})}{\\bar{j}_l \\bar{\\alpha}} = \\frac{0.80(1-0.35)}{1.20(0.35)} = \\frac{0.80 \\times 0.65}{1.20 \\times 0.35} = \\frac{0.52}{0.42} = \\frac{26}{21} \\approx 1.2381$$\nNext, we calculate the squared terms for the relative uncertainty formula:\n$$\\left( \\frac{\\sigma_{j_g}}{\\bar{j}_g} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{0.05}{0.80} \\right)^2 = (0.0625)^2 = 0.00390625$$\n$$\\left( \\frac{\\sigma_{j_l}}{\\bar{j}_l} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{0.05}{1.20} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{1}{24} \\right)^2 \\approx (0.041667)^2 \\approx 0.00173611$$\nThe term for the void fraction uncertainty requires special calculation:\n$$\\bar{\\alpha}(1-\\bar{\\alpha}) = 0.35(1-0.35) = 0.35 \\times 0.65 = 0.2275$$\n$$\\left( \\frac{\\sigma_{\\alpha}}{\\bar{\\alpha}(1-\\bar{\\alpha})} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{0.02}{0.2275} \\right)^2 \\approx (0.087912)^2 \\approx 0.0077285$$\nNow, sum the squared terms:\n$$\\left( \\frac{\\sigma_S}{\\bar{S}} \\right)^2 \\approx 0.00390625 + 0.00173611 + 0.0077285 = 0.01337086$$\nThe relative uncertainty in $S$ is the square root of this sum:\n$$\\frac{\\sigma_S}{\\bar{S}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.01337086} \\approx 0.115632$$\nFinally, the absolute uncertainty $\\sigma_S$ is found by multiplying the relative uncertainty by the mean value $\\bar{S}$:\n$$\\sigma_S = \\bar{S} \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_S}{\\bar{S}} \\right) \\approx 1.2381 \\times 0.115632 \\approx 0.14316$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the numerical uncertainty is $0.143$.\n\nConceptual Explanation:\nThe slip ratio, $S$, is a kinematic quantity representing the ratio of the average velocities of the two phases. In a predictive simulation based on a two-fluid model, the state of the system is advanced by solving conservation equations for mass, momentum, and energy for each phase. The momentum equations are coupled through interfacial exchange terms, primarily interfacial drag. The magnitude of this drag is a function of the flow regime because the regime dictates the interfacial geometry (e.g., small spherical bubbles, large distorted cap bubbles, liquid film on a wall) and thus the interfacial area concentration and the drag coefficient.\n\nA predictive model requires closure laws to compute these interfacial forces. These closure laws are empirical and specific to the flow regime. For example, the drag law for small, rigid spherical bubbles is drastically different from the drag law for a wavy annular film. The model first uses a flow regime map (typically based on superficial velocities $j_g$ and $j_l$, fluid properties, and geometry) to determine the likely regime. Then, it selects the appropriate set of closure laws for that regime. The solution of the coupled momentum equations then *yields* a value for the slip ratio, $S$, as a result.\n\nThe inferred value of $S$ from an experiment is an integrated result of all the complex physics of interfacial momentum exchange occurring within the flow. A single value of $S$, say $S \\approx 1.24$, does not contain enough information to uniquely reverse-engineer the underlying flow structure. It is possible for a bubbly flow at one mass flux and a churn-turbulent flow at another mass flux to produce the same slip ratio. The slip ratio is a consequence of the flow regime, not its unique determinant. Therefore, in a predictive context, one cannot simply use a measured value of $S$ to select the closure laws; rather, one must predict the regime from fundamental parameters ($j_g$, $j_l$, pressure, etc.), apply the corresponding closures, and then calculate $S$. The comparison of this calculated $S$ with the measured $S$ serves as a validation of the model's flow regime map and closure package.",
