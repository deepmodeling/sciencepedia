Although this model assumes the liquid and vapor phases move at the same velocity, it serves as an essential baseline for understanding how the mass of steam in a channel translates to the volume it occupies. This exercise  will guide you through deriving this core relationship and analyzing its behavior under conditions typical of high-pressure reactors, revealing a key principle behind reactor safety.",

            "problem": "A vertical subchannel in a Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) core carries a steady, adiabatic, one-dimensional, saturated two-phase water–steam mixture. At a given axial location, assume the Homogeneous Equilibrium Model (HEM): the liquid and vapor phases are in thermal and mechanical equilibrium and move with the same velocity. Let the mass quality be defined by $x \\equiv m_{g}/(m_{g}+m_{l})$, where $m_{g}$ and $m_{l}$ are the vapor and liquid masses contained in an infinitesimal control volume at that location, and let the void fraction be defined by $\\alpha \\equiv V_{g}/(V_{g}+V_{l})$, where $V_{g}$ and $V_{l}$ are the vapor and liquid volumes within the same control volume. Denote the saturated phase densities at the local pressure by $\\rho_{g}$ and $\\rho_{l}$, treated as known parameters.\n\nStarting only from these definitions and the HEM kinematic assumption, derive an expression for the void fraction $\\alpha$ written solely in terms of the quality $x$ and the densities $\\rho_{g}$ and $\\rho_{l}$. Then, analyze the limiting behavior of your expression in the asymptotic regime $\\rho_{g}/\\rho_{l} \\to 0$ for any fixed $x$ with $0<x<1$, and explain the physical interpretation of this limit in the context of nuclear reactor thermal–hydraulics.\n\nExpress your final result as a single closed-form analytic expression $\\alpha(x,\\rho_{g},\\rho_{l})$. No numerical evaluation is required.",
            "solution": "The objective is to derive a relationship between the void fraction, $\\alpha$, and the mass quality, $x$. We begin with the fundamental definitions provided.\n\nThe void fraction, $\\alpha$, is the ratio of the vapor volume, $V_g$, to the total volume, $V_{total} = V_g + V_l$:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{V_g}{V_g + V_l} $$\n\nThe mass quality, $x$, is the ratio of the vapor mass, $m_g$, to the total mass, $m_{total} = m_g + m_l$:\n$$ x = \\frac{m_g}{m_g + m_l} $$\n\nFrom the definition of quality, we can also express the liquid mass fraction as:\n$$ 1-x = \\frac{m_g + m_l - m_g}{m_g + m_l} = \\frac{m_l}{m_g + m_l} $$\n\nThe connection between mass and volume for each phase is given by the respective phase densities, $\\rho_g$ and $\\rho_l$:\n$$ m_g = \\rho_g V_g \\implies V_g = \\frac{m_g}{\\rho_g} $$\n$$ m_l = \\rho_l V_l \\implies V_l = \\frac{m_l}{\\rho_l} $$\n\nWe can substitute these expressions for volume into the definition of the void fraction:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{\\frac{m_g}{\\rho_g}}{\\frac{m_g}{\\rho_g} + \\frac{m_l}{\\rho_l}} $$\n\nTo introduce the quality, $x$, we can divide the numerator and denominator by the total mass, $m_{total} = m_g + m_l$:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{\\frac{m_g / m_{total}}{\\rho_g}}{\\frac{m_g / m_{total}}{\\rho_g} + \\frac{m_l / m_{total}}{\\rho_l}} $$\n\nRecognizing that $\\frac{m_g}{m_{total}} = x$ and $\\frac{m_l}{m_{total}} = 1-x$, we can substitute these into the equation:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{\\frac{x}{\\rho_g}}{\\frac{x}{\\rho_g} + \\frac{1-x}{\\rho_l}} $$\n\nThis expression relates $\\alpha$ to $x$, $\\rho_g$, and $\\rho_l$ as required. It can be algebraically rearranged into several common forms. To obtain a structured form, we can simplify the complex fraction. Multiplying the numerator and denominator by $\\rho_g \\rho_l$ yields:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{\\frac{x}{\\rho_g} (\\rho_g \\rho_l)}{(\\frac{x}{\\rho_g} + \\frac{1-x}{\\rho_l}) (\\rho_g \\rho_l)} = \\frac{x \\rho_l}{x \\rho_l + (1-x) \\rho_g} $$\n\nAn alternative, and often more insightful, form is obtained by dividing the numerator and denominator of the complex fraction by the numerator's term, $\\frac{x}{\\rho_g}$:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{(1-x)/\\rho_l}{x/\\rho_g}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1-x}{x} \\frac{\\rho_g}{\\rho_l}} $$\nThis final form is the desired expression. The HEM assumption of equal phase velocities ($u_g = u_l$) ensures that the quality defined by mass flow rates ($\\dot{m}_g / \\dot{m}_{total}$) is identical to the static quality ($m_g / m_{total}$) used in this derivation, thus making the result applicable to the specified flow problem.\n\nNext, we analyze the limiting behavior of this expression in the asymptotic regime where the density ratio $\\frac{\\rho_g}{\\rho_l} \\to 0$. This limit is physically relevant for gas-liquid systems far from the critical point, where the liquid is significantly denser than the vapor. The quality $x$ is held fixed such that $0 < x < 1$.\n\nWe take the limit of the derived expression for $\\alpha$:\n$$ \\lim_{\\frac{\\rho_g}{\\rho_l} \\to 0} \\alpha = \\lim_{\\frac{\\rho_g}{\\rho_l} \\to 0} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1-x}{x} \\frac{\\rho_g}{\\rho_l}} \\right) $$\nSince $x$ is a fixed value between $0$ and $1$, the term $\\frac{1-x}{x}$ is a finite, positive constant. As $\\frac{\\rho_g}{\\rho_l} \\to 0$, the product term in the denominator approaches zero:\n$$ \\frac{1-x}{x} \\frac{\\rho_g}{\\rho_l} \\to 0 $$\nTherefore, the limit of the void fraction is:\n$$ \\lim_{\\frac{\\rho_g}{\\rho_l} \\to 0} \\alpha = \\frac{1}{1 + 0} = 1 $$\n\nFinally, we explain the physical interpretation of this result. The limit $\\alpha \\to 1$ means that the volume of the channel becomes almost entirely occupied by the vapor phase, even for a very small but non-zero mass quality $x$. This occurs because quality is a mass-based fraction, while void fraction is a volume-based fraction.\nIf the vapor density $\\rho_g$ is extremely small compared to the liquid density $\\rho_l$, then even a small mass of vapor $m_g$ will occupy a very large volume $V_g = \\frac{m_g}{\\rho_g}$. In contrast, the much larger mass of liquid $m_l$ will occupy a comparatively small and finite volume $V_l = \\frac{m_l}{\\rho_l}$.\nIn the expression $\\alpha = \\frac{V_g}{V_g + V_l}$, as $\\frac{\\rho_g}{\\rho_l} \\to 0$ for a fixed $x>0$, $V_g$ becomes disproportionately larger than $V_l$, causing their sum $V_g+V_l$ to be dominated by $V_g$. Consequently, the ratio approaches $1$.\n\nIn the context of a BWR, this result is of paramount importance. At typical operating pressures, the density of liquid water is much greater than that of steam ($\\rho_l \\gg \\rho_g$). The analysis shows that as soon as boiling commences ($x>0$), the steam voids rapidly occupy a large fraction of the flow channel volume. This has two critical effects:\n1.  **Neutron Moderation:** Liquid water acts as the neutron moderator. A high void fraction ($\\alpha \\approx 1$) signifies a large displacement of this liquid moderator by steam. This reduction in moderation lowers the rate of fission reactions. This phenomenon gives BWRs a negative void coefficient of reactivity, a key inherent safety feature that causes the reactor to reduce its power output if it begins to overheat and produce too much steam.\n2.  **Thermal-Hydraulic Performance:** A high void fraction drastically alters the flow regime, increases pressure drop, and changes the heat transfer characteristics from the fuel rod surface to the coolant. Accurately predicting the void fraction is thus essential for calculating thermal margins and ensuring the safe operation of the reactor, preventing conditions like Critical Heat Flux (CHF) that could lead to fuel damage.\n\nThe limit mathematically demonstrates a core principle of two-phase flow: in systems with large density differences, the volume is dominated by the light phase, while the mass can be dominated by the heavy phase.",

            "solution": "### Derivation of the Void Fraction Expression\nThe drift-flux model, as formulated by Zuber and Findlay, relates the area-averaged actual velocity of the gas phase, $\\langle u_g \\rangle$, to the area-averaged total volumetric flux (or mixture velocity), $j$, and the drift velocity, $V_{gj}$. The distribution parameter, $C_0$, accounts for the non-uniform radial distributions of void and velocity. The relationship is:\n$$ \\langle u_g \\rangle = C_{0} j + V_{gj} $$\nBy definition, the gas superficial velocity, $j_g$, is related to the void fraction, $\\alpha$, and the actual gas velocity, $\\langle u_g \\rangle$, by the identity:\n$$ j_g = \\alpha \\langle u_g \\rangle $$\nThis identity arises from the fundamental definitions: $j_g = Q_g / A_{total}$, $\\alpha = A_g / A_{total}$, and $\\langle u_g \\rangle = Q_g / A_g$, where $Q_g$ is the volumetric flow rate of the gas phase, $A_g$ is the area occupied by the gas, and $A_{total}$ is the total cross-sectional area.\n\nTo find an expression for $\\alpha$, we first express $\\langle u_g \\rangle$ from the second equation as $\\langle u_g \\rangle = j_g / \\alpha$.

Substituting the expression for $S$:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(P) \\approx \\left( -\\frac{k_v}{k_d R_{\\text{th}}} \\boldsymbol{w}^\\top \\right) \\Sigma_{\\alpha} \\left( -\\frac{k_v}{k_d R_{\\text{th}}} \\boldsymbol{w} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{k_v}{k_d R_{\\text{th}}} \\right)^2 \\boldsymbol{w}^\\top \\Sigma_{\\alpha} \\boldsymbol{w} $$\nThe covariance matrix is constructed from the standard deviations $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ and the correlation matrix $C$ as $\\Sigma_{\\alpha} = \\operatorname{diag}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) \\, C \\, \\operatorname{diag}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})$.\n\n**4. Computation for Test Cases**\n\nUsing these derived expressions, a program is executed to compute the values for the three test cases. The results, rounded to six decimal places, are collated into the required output format.",
