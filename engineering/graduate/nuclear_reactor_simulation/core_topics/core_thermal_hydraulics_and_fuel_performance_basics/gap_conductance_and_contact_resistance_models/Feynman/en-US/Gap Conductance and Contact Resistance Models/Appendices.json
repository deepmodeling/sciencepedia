All necessary data for the requested calculations and assessments are provided, and there are no internal contradictions. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution is provided below.\n\nThe problem asks for several related tasks: first, to derive the relationship between the nominal contact pressure $p$ and the ratio of real to nominal contact area, $A_r/A_0$, under the assumption of fully plastic contact; second, to compute the pressure $p$ required to achieve a specific area ratio; third, to assess the validity of the plastic deformation assumption using a plasticity index; and finally, to discuss the physical realism of the calculated pressure in the context of a Light Water Reactor (LWR).\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Pressure-Area Relationship**\n\nWe begin from the definitions of nominal pressure and microhardness. The nominal pressure, $p$, is defined as the total normal load, $P_{total}$, distributed over the nominal or apparent contact area, $A_0$:\n$$\np = \\frac{P_{total}}{A_0}\n$$\nThe problem states that the contact is plastically dominated. In a purely plastic contact model, it is assumed that the entire load is supported by microcontacts that have plastically deformed. The mean pressure sustained by these plastically deformed microcontacts is equal to the microhardness, $H$, of the softer material (in this case, the zirconium alloy cladding). The total real area of contact, $A_r$, is the sum of the areas of all these individual microcontacts.\n\nTherefore, the total load $P_{total}$ can be expressed as the product of the microhardness and the real contact area:\n$$\nP_{total} = H \\cdot A_r\n$$\nBy substituting this expression for $P_{total}$ into the definition of nominal pressure, we obtain the desired relationship:\n$$\np = \\frac{H \\cdot A_r}{A_0}\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\np = H \\left(\\frac{A_r}{A_0}\\right)\n$$\nThis fundamental equation shows that for a plastically dominated contact, the nominal pressure is directly proportional to the ratio of the real contact area to the nominal area, with the constant of proportionality being the microhardness of the softer material.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Nominal Pressure**\n\nWe are asked to compute the pressure $p$ needed to achieve a real-to-nominal area ratio of $A_r/A_0 = 0.02$. The given microhardness of the cladding is $H = 1.5\\ \\mathrm{GPa}$.\n\nUsing the derived relationship:\n$$\np = (1.5\\ \\mathrm{GPa}) \\cdot (0.02) = 0.03\\ \\mathrm{GPa}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in megapascals (MPa). Since $1\\ \\mathrm{GPa} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$, we convert the result:\n$$\np = 0.03 \\times 1000\\ \\mathrm{MPa} = 30\\ \\mathrm{MPa}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the pressure is $30.00\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$.\n\n**Part 3: Self-Consistency Check of the Plastic Deformation Assumption**\n\nTo assess whether the assumption of plastically dominated contact is self-consistent for the given surface parameters, we evaluate the Greenwood-Williamson plasticity index, $\\psi$. This dimensionless index compares the elastic properties of the material pair to the plastic properties and surface topography. It is defined as:\n$$\n\\psi = \\frac{E^*}{H} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma}{R}}\n$$\nwhere $E^*$ is the composite elastic modulus, $H$ is the microhardness, $\\sigma$ is the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness, and $R$ is the characteristic radius of asperity summits.\nA general rule of thumb for interpreting the index is:\n- $\\psi < 0.6$: Contact is predominantly elastic.\n- $\\psi > 1.0$: Contact is predominantly plastic.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the composite elastic modulus, $E^*$, using the given formula and material properties:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{E^*} = \\frac{1 - \\nu_1^2}{E_1} + \\frac{1 - \\nu_2^2}{E_2}\n$$\nFor the zirconium alloy (material 1): $E_1 = 100\\ \\mathrm{GPa}$ and $\\nu_1 = 0.34$.\nFor the uranium dioxide (material 2): $E_2 = 200\\ \\mathrm{GPa}$ and $\\nu_2 = 0.30$.\n\nSubstituting these values:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{E^*} = \\frac{1 - (0.34)^2}{100\\ \\mathrm{GPa}} + \\frac{1 - (0.30)^2}{200\\ \\mathrm{GPa}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{E^*} = \\frac{1 - 0.1156}{100} + \\frac{1 - 0.09}{200} = \\frac{0.8844}{100} + \\frac{0.91}{200}\\ \\left[\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1}\\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{E^*} = 0.008844 + 0.00455 = 0.013394\\ \\mathrm{GPa}^{-1}\n$$\nTherefore, the composite elastic modulus is:\n$$\nE^* = \\frac{1}{0.013394}\\ \\mathrm{GPa} \\approx 74.660\\ \\mathrm{GPa}\n$$\nNow we can compute the plasticity index $\\psi$. We are given $H = 1.5\\ \\mathrm{GPa}$, $\\sigma = 1.5\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}$, and $R = 20\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}$.\n$$\n\\psi = \\frac{74.660\\ \\mathrm{GPa}}{1.5\\ \\mathrm{GPa}} \\sqrt{\\frac{1.5\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}}{20\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}}}\n$$\nThe units for pressure (GPa) and length ($\\mu$m) cancel out, as expected for a dimensionless index.\n$$\n\\psi \\approx (49.773) \\cdot \\sqrt{0.075} \\approx (49.773) \\cdot (0.27386) \\approx 13.63\n$$\nThe calculated plasticity index is $\\psi \\approx 13.63$. Since this value is significantly greater than $1.0$, the model predicts that the contact is strongly dominated by plastic deformation of the asperities. Thus, the initial assumption of a plastically dominated contact regime is self-consistent and appropriate for this system.\n\n**Part 4: Discussion of the Realism of the Resulting Pressure**\n\nThe calculated nominal contact pressure is $p = 30.00\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$. We need to assess if this is a realistic pressure for pellet–clad mechanical interaction (PCMI) during LWR operation.\n\nIn an LWR, PCMI arises from the differential thermal expansion of the $\\text{UO}_2$ fuel pellet and the zirconium alloy cladding, as well as fuel swelling due to the accumulation of solid and gaseous fission products.\n- At the beginning of life, a gap exists between the pellet and cladding, and the contact pressure is essentially zero, with the external coolant pressure ($ \\approx 15.5\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$ in a Pressurized Water Reactor) acting on the clad.\n- As the reactor operates and fuel burnup increases, the fuel swells and the gap closes. PCMI begins, leading to contact pressure at the interface.\n- Typical contact pressures reported in literature for steady-state operation and moderate power levels at intermediate-to-high burnup range from a few MPa to several tens of MPa. For instance, values in the range of $20-50\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$ are commonly simulated and inferred.\n- During power transients (ramps), the fuel pellet heats up faster than the clad, causing more rapid thermal expansion and leading to temporarily higher PCMI pressures, which can reach values of $50-100\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$ or more.\n\nThe calculated pressure of $p = 30.00\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$ falls squarely within the range of significant PCMI pressures expected during normal reactor operation after the initial fuel densification and swelling have closed the pellet-clad gap. It represents a a state of firm mechanical contact, high enough to influence heat transfer and clad stress, but it is not an extreme value associated with severe transients. Therefore, the resulting pressure is physically realistic for the specified context.",
