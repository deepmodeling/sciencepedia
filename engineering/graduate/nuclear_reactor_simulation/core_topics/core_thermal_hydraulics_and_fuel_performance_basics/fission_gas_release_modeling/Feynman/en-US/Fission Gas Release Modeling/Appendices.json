            "problem": "In modeling intra-granular fission gas behavior in Uranium Dioxide ($\\text{UO}_2$) fuel during steady operation, consider a single spherical fuel grain of radius $R$ within which fission gas atoms (e.g., xenon and krypton) are produced uniformly at a volumetric rate $S$ and diffuse with a constant tracer diffusion coefficient $D$. Assume spherical symmetry, no sinks or sources other than the uniform production $S$ within the grain volume, and neglect any re-solution or trapping within the grain interior.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the steady-state radial concentration profile $C(r)$ and the volume-averaged concentration $\\bar{C}$ of fission gas atoms within a spherical fuel grain. The validation of the problem statement is the first step.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- System: A single spherical fuel grain of radius $R$.\n- Gas production rate: Uniform and volumetric, denoted by $S$. Units can be considered as atoms per unit volume per unit time, e.g., $\\mathrm{atoms} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-3} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n- Diffusion coefficient: Constant tracer diffusion coefficient, $D$. Units are $\\mathrm{m}^{2} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n- Symmetry: Spherical symmetry is assumed. The concentration $C$ is a function of the radial coordinate $r$ only, i.e., $C=C(r)$.\n- Sinks and sources: A uniform volumetric source $S$ exists for $0 \\le r \\le R$. There are no other sinks or sources within the grain volume.\n- Boundary conditions:\n    1. The grain boundary at $r=R$ is a perfect sink, so the concentration is zero: $C(R)=0$.\n    2. The concentration must remain finite at the center of the grain, $r=0$. This also implies a symmetry condition of zero flux at the center, $\\frac{dC}{dr}|_{r=0} = 0$.\n- Operational mode: The system is at steady state, meaning all time derivatives are zero.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the validation criteria.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem describes a classic diffusion-production scenario governed by Fick's laws of diffusion. This is a fundamental and widely used model in materials science and nuclear engineering, often referred to as the Booth model for fission gas release. The assumptions, such as a spherical grain, constant diffusion coefficient, and uniform production rate, are standard simplifications used to obtain an analytical solution that provides key physical insights. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a governing physical principle (diffusion with a source), a defined geometry (a sphere), and a complete set of boundary conditions for a second-order ordinary differential equation that results from the steady-state assumption. The conditions ($C(R)=0$ and finitude/zero-flux at $r=0$) are sufficient to determine a unique and stable solution.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, unambiguous, and objective scientific terminology. It is free from subjective claims or opinions.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the listed flaws (e.g., scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity).\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Concentration Profile $C(r)$\n\nThe local conservation of species in a stationary medium is described by the equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{J} + S\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the concentration, $\\vec{J}$ is the diffusive flux vector, and $S$ is the volumetric source term.\n\nAccording to Fick's first law, the flux is proportional to the concentration gradient:\n$$\n\\vec{J} = -D \\nabla C\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient.\n\nSubstituting Fick's law into the conservation equation gives Fick's second law with a source term:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\cdot (D \\nabla C) + S\n$$\nGiven the assumption of spherical symmetry, the concentration $C$ depends only on the radial coordinate $r$, so $C=C(r)$. The Laplacian operator $\\nabla^2 = \\nabla \\cdot \\nabla$ in spherical coordinates simplifies to:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 C = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r^2 \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial r} \\right)\n$$\nWith a constant diffusion coefficient $D$, the equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r^2 \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial r} \\right) + S\n$$\nThe problem specifies steady-state operation, which means $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t}=0$. The governing equation thus simplifies to an ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\n0 = D \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dC}{dr} \\right) + S\n$$\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dC}{dr} \\right) = -\\frac{S}{D} r^2\n$$\nWe can solve this equation by integrating twice with respect to $r$. The first integration yields:\n$$\nr^2 \\frac{dC}{dr} = \\int -\\frac{S}{D} r^2 \\, dr = -\\frac{S r^3}{3D} + A_1\n$$\nwhere $A_1$ is the first integration constant. Dividing by $r^2$, we have the expression for the concentration gradient:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dr} = -\\frac{S r}{3D} + \\frac{A_1}{r^2}\n$$\nThe boundary condition at the center of the grain ($r=0$) is that the concentration must be finite. Due to spherical symmetry, the concentration gradient must be zero at the center: $\\frac{dC}{dr}|_{r=0} = 0$. If $A_1$ were non-zero, the term $\\frac{A_1}{r^2}$ would cause the gradient to diverge to infinity as $r \\to 0$. Therefore, we must have $A_1 = 0$.\n\nWith $A_1=0$, the equation for the gradient simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dr} = -\\frac{S r}{3D}\n$$\nIntegrating a second time with respect to $r$ gives the concentration profile:\n$$\nC(r) = \\int -\\frac{S r}{3D} \\, dr = -\\frac{S r^2}{6D} + A_2\n$$\nwhere $A_2$ is the second integration constant. We use the boundary condition at the grain surface, $C(R)=0$, to determine $A_2$:\n$$\n0 = C(R) = -\\frac{S R^2}{6D} + A_2\n$$\nSolving for $A_2$, we find:\n$$\nA_2 = \\frac{S R^2}{6D}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $C(r)$, we obtain the final steady-state concentration profile:\n$$\nC(r) = \\frac{S R^2}{6D} - \\frac{S r^2}{6D} = \\frac{S}{6D}(R^2 - r^2)\n$$\n\n### Derivation of the Volume-Averaged Concentration $\\bar{C}$\n\nThe volume-averaged concentration $\\bar{C}$ over the spherical grain volume $V$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\bar{C} = \\frac{1}{V} \\int_V C(r) \\, dV\n$$\nFor a sphere of radius $R$, the volume is $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$. In spherical coordinates, the differential volume element is $dV = 4\\pi r^2 dr$. The integral becomes:\n$$\n\\bar{C} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3} \\int_0^R C(r) (4\\pi r^2) \\, dr\n$$\nThe factor $4\\pi$ cancels out, simplifying the expression to:\n$$\n\\bar{C} = \\frac{3}{R^3} \\int_0^R C(r) r^2 \\, dr\n$$\nNow, substitute the derived expression for $C(r)$:\n$$\n\\bar{C} = \\frac{3}{R^3} \\int_0^R \\frac{S}{6D}(R^2 - r^2) r^2 \\, dr\n$$\nWe can pull the constants outside the integral:\n$$\n\\bar{C} = \\frac{3S}{6DR^3} \\int_0^R (R^2 r^2 - r^4) \\, dr = \\frac{S}{2DR^3} \\int_0^R (R^2 r^2 - r^4) \\, dr\n$$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$\n\\int_0^R (R^2 r^2 - r^4) \\, dr = \\left[ R^2 \\frac{r^3}{3} - \\frac{r^5}{5} \\right]_0^R\n$$\nEvaluating the definite integral from $0$ to $R$:\n$$\n\\left( R^2 \\frac{R^3}{3} - \\frac{R^5}{5} \\right) - (0 - 0) = \\frac{R^5}{3} - \\frac{R^5}{5} = \\frac{5R^5 - 3R^5}{15} = \\frac{2R^5}{15}\n$$\nFinally, substitute this result back into the expression for $\\bar{C}$:\n$$\n\\bar{C} = \\frac{S}{2DR^3} \\left( \\frac{2R^5}{15} \\right)\n$$\nSimplifying the expression gives the volume-averaged concentration:\n$$\n\\bar{C} = \\frac{S R^2}{15D}\n$$\nThe two required expressions are $C(r) = \\frac{S}{6D}(R^2 - r^2)$ and $\\bar{C} = \\frac{S R^2}{15D}$.",

The partial derivatives of $C$ are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial r} = \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r} - \\frac{u}{r^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2} C}{\\partial r^{2}} = \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial r^{2}} - \\frac{2}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r} + \\frac{2u}{r^3}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the spherical diffusion equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = D \\left( \\left( \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial r^{2}} - \\frac{2}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r} + \\frac{2u}{r^3} \\right) + \\frac{2}{r} \\left( \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r} - \\frac{u}{r^2} \\right) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = D \\left( \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial r^{2}} \\right)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the one-dimensional heat/diffusion equation for $u(r, t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial r^{2}}\n$$\nThe initial and boundary conditions must be transformed for $u(r, t)$:\n1.  **Initial Condition:** $C(r, 0) = C_0$ for $0 \\le r < R$. Thus, $u(r, 0) = r C(r, 0) = r C_0$.\n2.  **Boundary Condition at Center:** The concentration $C(r,t)$ must be finite at $r=0$.

The program will iterate through the three test cases, execute this procedure, and report a boolean value for each indicating whether the convergence criterion was met.\n\n```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves a stiff ODE system for fission gas release and tests numerical convergence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Shared physical constants\n    k_B = 1.380649e-23  # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n    pi = np.pi\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1: Moderate ramp\n        {\n            'L': 5e-6, 'N': 50, 'D': 5e-14, 'k_cap': 1e-8, 'n_b': 1e14, 'P_b': 5.0e7, 'T': 1200,\n            'C_init': 1e22, 'Gb_init': 1e18,\n            'k_low': 1e-5, 'k_high': 1e-2, 't_r': 500, 'tau': 100,\n            't_end': 2000, 'epsilon': 1e-3,\n        },\n        # Case 2: Rapid ramp\n        {\n            'L': 5e-6, 'N': 50, 'D': 5e-14, 'k_cap': 1e-8, 'n_b': 1e14, 'P_b': 5.0e7, 'T': 1200,\n            'C_init': 1e22, 'Gb_init': 1e18,\n            'k_low': 1e-5, 'k_high': 1.0, 't_r': 10, 'tau': 1,\n            't_end': 100, 'epsilon': 1e-3,\n        },\n        # Case 3: No capture\n        {\n            'L': 5e-6, 'N': 50, 'D': 5e-14, 'k_cap': 0.0, 'n_b': 1e14, 'P_b': 5.0e7, 'T': 1200,\n            'C_init': 1e22, 'Gb_init': 1e18,\n            'k_low': 1e-5, 'k_high': 1e-2, 't_r': 250, 'tau': 50,\n            't_end': 500, 'epsilon': 1e-3,\n        },\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    # Tolerances for coarse and fine solves\n    rtol_coarse, atol_coarse = 1e-4, 1e-4\n    rtol_fine, atol_fine = 1e-7, 1e-7\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        # Unpack case parameters into local variables\n        L, N, D, k_cap, n_b, P_b, T = case['L'], case['N'], case['D'], case['k_cap'], case['n_b'], case['P_b'], case['T']\n        C_init, Gb_init = case['C_init'], case['Gb_init']\n        k_low, k_high, t_r, tau = case['k_low'], case['k_high'], case['t_r'], case['tau']\n        t_end, epsilon = case['t_end'], case['epsilon']\n\n        dx = L / (N - 1)\n\n        def odesystem(t, y):\n            \"\"\"Defines the semi-discrete ODE system dy/dt = f(t,y).\"\"\"\n            C = y[:-1]\n            Gb = y[-1]\n\n            # Calculate time-dependent resolution coefficient\n            k_res = k_low + (k_high - k_low) / (1.0 + np.exp(-(t - t_r) / tau))\n\n            dCdt = np.zeros(N)\n\n            # Node i=0 (center, no-flux)\n            dCdt[0] = D * (C[1] - C[0]) / dx**2\n\n            # Interior nodes i=1 to N-2\n            dCdt[1:-1] = D * (C[:-2] - 2 * C[1:-1] + C[2:]) / dx**2\n\n            # Node i=N-1 (boundary)\n            dCdt[-1] = (D * (C[-2] - C[-1]) / dx**2\n                        - (k_cap * C[-1]) / dx\n                        + (k_res * Gb) / dx)\n\n            # Boundary bubble inventory\n            dGbdt = k_cap * C[-1] - k_res * Gb\n            \n            return np.append(dCdt, dGbdt)\n\n        def calculate_radius(Gb):\n            \"\"\"Calculates bubble radius from gas inventory.\"\"\"\n            if Gb = 0:\n                return 0.0\n            \n            N_atoms_per_bubble = Gb / n_b\n            radius_cubed = (3.0 * N_atoms_per_bubble * k_B * T) / (4.0 * pi * P_b)\n            return radius_cubed**(1.0/3.0)\n\n        # Initial condition vector\n        y0 = np.full(N, C_init)\n        y0 = np.append(y0, Gb_init)\n        \n        t_span = (0, t_end)\n\n        # Coarse solve\n        sol_coarse = solve_ivp(odesystem, t_span, y0, method='BDF', \n                               rtol=rtol_coarse, atol=atol_coarse)\n        Gb_final_coarse = sol_coarse.y[-1, -1]\n        r_coarse = calculate_radius(Gb_final_coarse)\n\n        # Fine solve\n        sol_fine = solve_ivp(odesystem, t_span, y0, method='BDF', \n                             rtol=rtol_fine, atol=atol_fine)\n        Gb_final_fine = sol_fine.y[-1, -1]\n        r_fine = calculate_radius(Gb_final_fine)\n\n        # Check for convergence\n        if r_fine == 0.0:\n            rel_diff = 0.0 if r_coarse == 0.0 else float('inf')\n        else:\n            rel_diff = np.abs(r_fine - r_coarse) / r_fine\n        \n        converged = rel_diff  epsilon\n        results.append(converged)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, [r.item() for r in results]))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```",
