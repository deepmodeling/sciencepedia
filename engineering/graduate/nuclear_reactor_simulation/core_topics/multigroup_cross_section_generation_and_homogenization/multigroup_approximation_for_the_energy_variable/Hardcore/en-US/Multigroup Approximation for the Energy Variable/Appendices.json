No numerical evaluation is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a mixing rule for macroscopic multigroup cross sections in a homogeneous medium, based on the principle of reaction rate preservation. It also asks for a discussion of the limitations of this rule.\n\nFirst, a point of clarification regarding the notation is necessary. The problem defines the energy group $g$ as the interval $E \\in [E_{g-1}, E_g]$, with $E_0$ being the highest energy and $E_G$ the lowest. This implies the standard ordering in neutron physics: $E_0  E_1  \\dots  E_g  \\dots  E_G$. With this ordering, $E_{g-1}  E_g$, which makes the interval $[E_{g-1}, E_g]$ an empty set by standard mathematical definition. Furthermore, the integrals for group-integrated flux, $\\Phi_g$, and group reaction rates are written with a lower limit $E_{g-1}$ and an upper limit $E_g$. Since the integrand (the scalar flux $\\phi(E)$) is a non-negative physical quantity, this would result in a non-positive value for $\\Phi_g$ and the integrated reaction rate, as $\\int_a^b f(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x = -\\int_b^a f(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x$ if $a  b$. Physically, both integrated flux and reaction rates must be non-negative.\n\nHowever, the definition for the group-collapsed cross section $\\Sigma_{x,g}$ is given as a ratio of two such integrals. The negative signs would cancel, leaving the mathematical structure of the definition valid regardless of the integration order, provided it is used consistently. Therefore, for the purpose of this derivation, I shall strictly adhere to the notation as provided in the problem statement. The standard physical interpretation is that the integration occurs over the energy range of the group, i.e., from $E_g$ to $E_{g-1}$.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the fundamental definition of a multigroup cross section, which is constructed to preserve the total reaction rate within an energy group $g$. For a mixture of isotopes, let this macroscopic group cross section be denoted by $\\Sigma_{x,g}^{\\mathrm{mix}}$. The reaction rate preservation condition is:\n$$\n\\Sigma_{x,g}^{\\mathrm{mix}} \\, \\Phi_g = \\int_{E_{g-1}}^{E_g} \\Sigma_{x}^{\\mathrm{mix}}(E) \\, \\phi(E) \\, \\mathrm{d}E\n$$\nwhere $\\Phi_g = \\int_{E_{g-1}}^{E_g} \\phi(E) \\, \\mathrm{d}E$ is the group-integrated flux and $\\Sigma_{x}^{\\mathrm{mix}}(E)$ is the energy-dependent macroscopic cross section of the mixture.\n\nThe problem provides the definition for $\\Sigma_{x}^{\\mathrm{mix}}(E)$ as the linear superposition of the contributions from each constituent isotope $i$:\n$$\n\\Sigma_{x}^{\\mathrm{mix}}(E) = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} N_i \\, \\sigma_{x}^{(i)}(E)\n$$\nwhere $N_i$ is the number density of isotope $i$ and $\\sigma_{x}^{(i)}(E)$ is its microscopic cross section for reaction type $x$. The derivation assumes a perfectly homogeneous mixture where all isotopes are subject to the same neutron flux spectrum, $\\phi(E)$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Sigma_{x}^{\\mathrm{mix}}(E)$ into the reaction rate preservation equation yields:\n$$\n\\Sigma_{x,g}^{\\mathrm{mix}} \\, \\Phi_g = \\int_{E_{g-1}}^{E_g} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{m} N_i \\, \\sigma_{x}^{(i)}(E) \\right) \\phi(E) \\, \\mathrm{d}E\n$$\nSince the summation is over a finite number of isotopes, the order of summation and integration can be interchanged:\n$$\n\\Sigma_{x,g}^{\\mathrm{mix}} \\, \\Phi_g = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} N_i \\int_{E_{g-1}}^{E_g} \\sigma_{x}^{(i)}(E) \\, \\phi(E) \\, \\mathrm{d}E\n$$\nTo find the expression for $\\Sigma_{x,g}^{\\mathrm{mix}}$, we can divide both sides by the group-integrated flux, $\\Phi_g$:\n$$\n\\Sigma_{x,g}^{\\mathrm{mix}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{m} N_i \\int_{E_{g-1}}^{E_g} \\sigma_{x}^{(i)}(E) \\, \\phi(E) \\, \\mathrm{d}E}{\\Phi_g}\n$$\nSubstituting the integral definition of $\\Phi_g$, we arrive at the final mixing rule:\n$$\n\\Sigma_{x,g}^{\\mathrm{mix}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{m} N_i \\int_{E_{g-1}}^{E_g} \\sigma_{x}^{(i)}(E) \\, \\phi(E) \\, \\mathrm{d}E}{\\int_{E_{g-1}}^{E_g} \\phi(E) \\, \\mathrm{d}E}\n$$\nThis expression demonstrates that the macroscopic group cross section of a homogeneous mixture is the sum of the constituent number densities, each multiplied by its respective flux-weighted average microscopic cross section over that group. We can define the microscopic group cross section for isotope $i$ as:\n$$\n\\sigma_{x,g}^{(i)} = \\frac{\\int_{E_{g-1}}^{E_g} \\sigma_{x}^{(i)}(E) \\, \\phi(E) \\, \\mathrm{d}E}{\\int_{E_{g-1}}^{E_g} \\phi(E) \\, \\mathrm{d}E}\n$$\nWith this definition, the mixing rule takes on the simpler linear form:\n$$\n\\Sigma_{x,g}^{\\mathrm{mix}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} N_i \\, \\sigma_{x,g}^{(i)}\n$$\n\nThe discussion of the limitations of this mixing rule centers on the validity of its core assumption: that a single, common flux spectrum $\\phi(E)$ is experienced by all nuclei in the mixture. This assumption is explicitly made under \"homogeneous conditions.\" However, this idealization breaks down in many practical scenarios, rendering a naive application of the mixing rule inaccurate.\n\nThe primary limitation arises from the fact that multigroup cross sections are not fundamental constants but are, by their very definition, dependent on the flux spectrum $\\phi(E)$ used as the weighting function in the averaging process. The flux spectrum itself is a solution to the Neutron Transport Equation and is determined by the material composition (the set of all $N_i$), temperature, and geometry of the system.\n\nA critical phenomenon that violates the common-flux assumption is **resonance self-shielding**. Certain isotopes, such as $^{238}\\mathrm{U}$, possess very large, narrow absorption or scattering cross section peaks called resonances. In an energy region containing a strong resonance, neutrons at or near the resonance energy are absorbed at a very high rate. This leads to a significant localized depression, or \"dip,\" in the neutron flux spectrum $\\phi(E)$ at that energy. Consequently, the nuclei of the resonant isotope are exposed to a flux that is much lower at the resonance energy than the flux seen by the nuclei of a different, non-resonant (or \"diluent\") isotope in the same mixture.\n\nIf one were to pre-calculate microscopic group cross sections $\\sigma_{x,g}^{(i)}$ for each isotope using a generic, unperturbed flux spectrum, and then try to assemble the macroscopic cross section for a new mixture using the linear rule $\\Sigma_{x,g}^{\\mathrm{mix}} = \\sum N'_i \\sigma_{x,g}^{(i)}$, the result would not preserve the true reaction rate. This is because the $\\sigma_{x,g}^{(i)}$ values were computed with an incorrect weighting function. The presence of the resonant material in the new mixture (with densities $N'_i$) changes the spectrum to $\\phi'(E)$, which now exhibits self-shielding dips. A correct calculation must use this new, perturbed spectrum $\\phi'(E)$ to re-calculate all the group cross sections. This coupling between composition and the flux spectrum makes the simple linear mixing of pre-computed constants invalid for achieving high accuracy, especially in resonance energy groups.\n\nOther phenomena exacerbate this issue. Strong **energy-dependent scattering** can locally alter the flux spectrum. A temperature increase causes **Doppler broadening** of resonances, making them lower and wider. This changes the shape of $\\sigma_x^{(i)}(E)$ and alters the self-shielding effect, which in turn modifies the flux spectrum $\\phi(E)$. Therefore, isotope-specific group cross sections are not only composition-dependent but also temperature-dependent in a non-trivial way.\n\nIn summary, the derived mixing rule is formally exact for a given mixture and its corresponding equilibrium flux spectrum. Its limitation lies in the practical application where isotope-specific group cross sections, treated as independent constants from a library, are mixed to form a cross section for a new composition. This procedure fails to preserve reaction rates because it neglects the fundamental dependency of the group cross sections on the flux spectrum, which itself is a function of the composition being modeled. Advanced methods in reactor analysis are dedicated to properly accounting for these self-shielding effects.",

The objective is to minimize the weighted $L^2$ error, defined by the squared norm $\\|f\\|_{L^{2}(w)}^{2}$. This quantity, which we will call the objective functional $J$, depends on the set of group constants $\\{\\Sigma_{x,g}\\}$ and the set of interior group boundaries $\\{E_g\\}_{g=1}^{G-1}$.\n\nThe objective functional $J$ is therefore:\n$$\nJ(\\{\\Sigma_{x,g}\\}_{g=1}^G, \\{E_g\\}_{g=1}^{G-1}) = \\int_{E_{\\min}}^{E_{\\max}} w(E) \\left[ \\Sigma_x(E) - \\hat{\\Sigma}_x(E) \\right]^2 \\mathrm{d}E\n$$\nSince $\\hat{\\Sigma}_x(E)$ is piecewise constant, we can split the integral into a sum of integrals over each energy group:\n$$\nJ = \\sum_{g=1}^{G} \\int_{E_{g-1}}^{E_g} w(E) \\left[ \\Sigma_x(E) - \\Sigma_{x,g} \\right]^2 \\mathrm{d}E\n$$\nThis is the desired objective functional. The only assumption made is that the product of the weight function and the squared error, $w(E)[\\Sigma_x(E)-\\Sigma_{x,g}]^2$, is integrable over each subinterval $(E_{g-1}, E_g]$. This is guaranteed if $\\Sigma_x(E)$ and $w(E)$ are, for example, piecewise continuous.\n\n(b) Derivation of the optimal group constants $\\Sigma_{x,g}$.\n\nFor a fixed set of group boundaries $\\{E_g\\}$, we find the optimal group constant $\\Sigma_{x,k}$ for a particular group $k$ by minimizing the functional $J$ with respect to $\\Sigma_{x,k}$. The necessary condition for a minimum is that the partial derivative of $J$ with respect to $\\Sigma_{x,k}$ must be zero. Since the terms in the summation are independent with respect to the group constants, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial \\Sigma_{x,k}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\Sigma_{x,k}} \\left( \\int_{E_{k-1}}^{E_k} w(E) \\left[ \\Sigma_x(E) - \\Sigma_{x,k} \\right]^2 \\mathrm{d}E \\right) = 0\n$$\nWe can differentiate under the integral sign:\n$$\n\\int_{E_{k-1}}^{E_k} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\Sigma_{x,k}} \\left( w(E) \\left[ \\Sigma_x(E) - \\Sigma_{x,k} \\right]^2 \\right) \\mathrm{d}E = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\int_{E_{k-1}}^{E_k} w(E) \\cdot 2 \\left[ \\Sigma_x(E) - \\Sigma_{x,k} \\right] \\cdot (-1) \\mathrm{d}E = 0\n$$\nSince the constant $-2$ is non-zero, we can divide it out:\n$$\n\\int_{E_{k-1}}^{E_k} w(E) \\left( \\Sigma_x(E) - \\Sigma_{x,k} \\right) \\mathrm{d}E = 0\n$$\nRearranging the terms:\n$$\n\\int_{E_{k-1}}^{E_k} w(E) \\Sigma_x(E) \\mathrm{d}E - \\int_{E_{k-1}}^{E_k} w(E) \\Sigma_{x,k} \\mathrm{d}E = 0\n$$\nSince $\\Sigma_{x,k}$ is a constant within the integral, we can factor it out:\n$$\n\\Sigma_{x,k} \\int_{E_{k-1}}^{E_k} w(E) \\mathrm{d}E = \\int_{E_{k-1}}^{E_k} w(E) \\Sigma_x(E) \\mathrm{d}E\n$$\nSolving for $\\Sigma_{x,k}$, we obtain the necessary condition for the optimal group constant, which we denote $\\Sigma_{x,k}^*$:\n$$\n\\Sigma_{x,k}^* = \\frac{\\int_{E_{k-1}}^{E_k} w(E) \\Sigma_x(E) \\mathrm{d}E}{\\int_{E_{k-1}}^{E_k} w(E) \\mathrm{d}E}\n$$\nThis shows that the optimal group constant is the weighted average of the continuous cross section $\\Sigma_x(E)$ over the group, with the weighting function $w(E)$.\n\n(c) Derivation of the stationarity condition for an interior boundary $E_k$.\n\nWe now seek the condition for an optimal interior group boundary $E_k$. The group constants $\\{\\Sigma_{x,g}\\}$ are assumed to be their optimal values $\\{\\Sigma_{x,g}^*\\}$ as derived in part (b). Let $J^*$ be the objective functional evaluated with these optimal constants. $J^*$ is now a function only of the group boundaries $\\{E_g\\}$.\n$$\nJ^*(\\{E_g\\}) = J(\\{E_g\\}, \\{\\Sigma_{x,g}^*(\\{E_g\\})\\})\n$$\nTo find the optimal $E_k$, we must satisfy the condition $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}J^*}{\\mathrm{d}E_k} = 0$. The envelope theorem states that the derivative of the optimized objective function (the value function) with respect to a parameter equals the partial derivative of the original objective function with respect to that parameter, evaluated at the optimal values of the choice variables. In our case:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}J^*}{\\mathrm{d}E_k} = \\left. \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial E_k} \\right|_{\\{\\Sigma_{x,g} = \\Sigma_{x,g}^*\\}}\n$$\nThe boundary $E_k$ appears as the upper limit of integration for group $k$ and the lower limit for group $k+1$. All other terms in the sum for $J$ are independent of $E_k$.\n$$\nJ = \\dots + \\int_{E_{k-1}}^{E_k} w(E) [\\Sigma_x(E) - \\Sigma_{x,k}]^2 \\mathrm{d}E + \\int_{E_k}^{E_{k+1}} w(E) [\\Sigma_x(E) - \\Sigma_{x,k+1}]^2 \\mathrm{d}E + \\dots\n$$\nUsing the Leibniz integral rule, we find the partial derivative of $J$ with respect to $E_k$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial E_k} = w(E_k)[\\Sigma_x(E_k) - \\Sigma_{x,k}]^2 \\cdot (1) - w(E_k)[\\Sigma_x(E_k) - \\Sigma_{x,k+1}]^2 \\cdot (1)\n$$\nSetting this to zero and evaluating at the optimal group constants $\\Sigma_{x,k}^*$ and $\\Sigma_{x,k+1}^*$ gives the stationarity condition:\n$$\nw(E_k)[\\Sigma_x(E_k) - \\Sigma_{x,k}^*]^2 - w(E_k)[\\Sigma_x(E_k) - \\Sigma_{x,k+1}^*]^2 = 0\n$$\nSince the problem states $w(E)$ is a positive weight function, $w(E_k)  0$, and we can divide by it:\n$$\n[\\Sigma_x(E_k) - \\Sigma_{x,k}^*]^2 = [\\Sigma_x(E_k) - \\Sigma_{x,k+1}^*]^2\n$$\nThis equation implies $\\Sigma_x(E_k) - \\Sigma_{x,k}^* = \\pm (\\Sigma_x(E_k) - \\Sigma_{x,k+1}^*)$.\nThe positive sign leads to $\\Sigma_{x,k}^* = \\Sigma_{x,k+1}^*$, which corresponds to a degenerate case where the boundary $E_k$ is redundant. For a meaningful group structure, we expect $\\Sigma_{x,k}^* \\neq \\Sigma_{x,k+1}^*$.\nThe negative sign gives the non-trivial condition:\n$$\n\\Sigma_x(E_k) - \\Sigma_{x,k}^* = -(\\Sigma_x(E_k) - \\Sigma_{x,k+1}^*) = \\Sigma_{x,k+1}^* - \\Sigma_x(E_k)\n$$\n$$\n2\\Sigma_x(E_k) = \\Sigma_{x,k}^* + \\Sigma_{x,k+1}^*\n$$\nThe necessary stationarity condition is therefore:\n$$\n\\Sigma_x(E_k) = \\frac{\\Sigma_{x,k}^* + \\Sigma_{x,k+1}^*}{2}\n$$\nThis condition states that for an optimal boundary location $E_k$, the value of the continuous cross section at that energy must be the arithmetic mean of the optimal group constants of the two adjacent groups.\n\n(d) Application to a 2-group case.\n\nWe are given a $2$-group problem on the interval $[E_{\\ell}, E_h]$ with a single interior boundary at $E = E^\\star$. The groups are group $1$: $[E_{\\ell}, E^\\star]$ and group $2$: $(E^\\star, E_h]$.\nThe given functions are $w(E) = C/E$ and $\\Sigma_x(E) = \\sigma_0 + \\sigma_1 \\ln(E/E_{\\ell})$. The constant $C$ will cancel in the calculation of the group constants.\nLet $\\Sigma_1$ and $\\Sigma_2$ be the optimal group constants for group $1$ and group $2$. From part (b):\n\nFor group $1$:\n$$\n\\Sigma_1 = \\frac{\\int_{E_{\\ell}}^{E^\\star} \\frac{1}{E} (\\sigma_0 + \\sigma_1 \\ln(E/E_{\\ell})) \\mathrm{d}E}{\\int_{E_{\\ell}}^{E^\\star} \\frac{1}{E} \\mathrm{d}E}\n$$\nThe denominator is $[\\ln E]_{E_{\\ell}}^{E^\\star} = \\ln(E^\\star/E_{\\ell})$.\nFor the numerator, let $t = \\ln(E/E_{\\ell})$, so $\\mathrm{d}t = (1/E)\\mathrm{d}E$. The limits of integration become $t(E_\\ell) = 0$ and $t(E^\\star) = \\ln(E^\\star/E_\\ell)$.\nNumerator: $\\int_{0}^{\\ln(E^\\star/E_\\ell)} (\\sigma_0 + \\sigma_1 t) \\mathrm{d}t = [\\sigma_0 t + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_1 t^2]_0^{\\ln(E^\\star/E_\\ell)} = \\sigma_0 \\ln(E^\\star/E_\\ell) + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_1 [\\ln(E^\\star/E_\\ell)]^2$.\nSo, $\\Sigma_1 = \\sigma_0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_1 \\ln(E^\\star/E_\\ell)$.\n\nFor group $2$:\n$$\n\\Sigma_2 = \\frac{\\int_{E^\\star}^{E_h} \\frac{1}{E} (\\sigma_0 + \\sigma_1 \\ln(E/E_{\\ell})) \\mathrm{d}E}{\\int_{E^\\star}^{E_h} \\frac{1}{E} \\mathrm{d}E}\n$$\nThe denominator is $[\\ln E]_{E^\\star}^{E_h} = \\ln(E_h/E^\\star)$.\nThe numerator, using the same substitution $t=\\ln(E/E_{\\ell})$, has limits $t(E^\\star) = \\ln(E^\\star/E_\\ell)$ and $t(E_h) = \\ln(E_h/E_\\ell)$.\nNumerator: $[\\sigma_0 t + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_1 t^2]_{\\ln(E^\\star/E_\\ell)}^{\\ln(E_h/E_\\ell)} = \\sigma_0(\\ln\\frac{E_h}{E_\\ell}-\\ln\\frac{E^\\star}{E_\\ell}) + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_1((\\ln\\frac{E_h}{E_\\ell})^2-(\\ln\\frac{E^\\star}{E_\\ell})^2)$.\nUsing $\\ln a - \\ln b = \\ln(a/b)$ and $a^2-b^2=(a-b)(a+b)$:\nNumerator: $\\sigma_0\\ln\\frac{E_h}{E^\\star} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_1(\\ln\\frac{E_h}{E^\\star})(\\ln\\frac{E_h}{E_\\ell}+\\ln\\frac{E^\\star}{E_\\ell})$.\nSo, $\\Sigma_2 = \\sigma_0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_1(\\ln(E_h/E_\\ell) + \\ln(E^\\star/E_\\ell))$.\n\nNow we apply the condition from part (c) at $E=E^\\star$: $\\Sigma_x(E^\\star) = (\\Sigma_1+\\Sigma_2)/2$.\nLHS: $\\Sigma_x(E^\\star) = \\sigma_0 + \\sigma_1 \\ln(E^\\star/E_\\ell)$.\nRHS: $\\frac{1}{2} [(\\sigma_0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_1 \\ln\\frac{E^\\star}{E_\\ell}) + (\\sigma_0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_1(\\ln\\frac{E_h}{E_\\ell} + \\ln\\frac{E^\\star}{E_\\ell}))]$.\nRHS: $\\sigma_0 + \\frac{1}{4}\\sigma_1 [ \\ln\\frac{E^\\star}{E_\\ell} + \\ln\\frac{E_h}{E_\\ell} + \\ln\\frac{E^\\star}{E_\\ell} ] = \\sigma_0 + \\frac{1}{4}\\sigma_1 [ 2\\ln\\frac{E^\\star}{E_\\ell} + \\ln\\frac{E_h}{E_\\ell} ]$.\n\nEquating the LHS and RHS (and subtracting $\\sigma_0$ from both sides, then dividing by $\\sigma_1 \\neq 0$):\n$$\n\\ln(E^\\star/E_\\ell) = \\frac{1}{4} [2\\ln(E^\\star/E_\\ell) + \\ln(E_h/E_\\ell)]\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(E^\\star/E_\\ell) = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(E^\\star/E_\\ell) + \\frac{1}{4}\\ln(E_h/E_\\ell)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\ln(E^\\star/E_\\ell) = \\frac{1}{4}\\ln(E_h/E_\\ell)\n$$\n$$\n2\\ln(E^\\star/E_\\ell) = \\ln(E_h/E_\\ell)\n$$\n$$\n\\ln((E^\\star/E_\\ell)^2) = \\ln(E_h/E_\\ell)\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives $(E^\\star/E_\\ell)^2 = E_h/E_\\ell$.\nSolving for $E^\\star$:\n$$\n(E^\\star)^2 = E_\\ell E_h \\implies E^\\star = \\sqrt{E_\\ell E_h}\n$$\nThe optimal boundary is the geometric mean of the interval endpoints.\n\nNumerically, with $E_\\ell = 0.5\\ \\mathrm{eV}$ and $E_h = 2.0 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{eV}$:\n$$\nE^\\star = \\sqrt{(0.5) \\cdot (2.0 \\times 10^6)} = \\sqrt{1.0 \\times 10^6} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{eV}\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures as requested, the answer is $1.000 \\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{eV}$.\n\nIn practice, for a general problem with many groups, the set of necessary conditions from parts (b) and (c) form a large system of coupled non-linear equations for $\\{\\Sigma_{x,g}\\}$ and $\\{E_g\\}$. This system is typically solved using iterative numerical methods, such as a fixed-point iteration or a Newton-Raphson scheme, to find the optimal group structure.",
