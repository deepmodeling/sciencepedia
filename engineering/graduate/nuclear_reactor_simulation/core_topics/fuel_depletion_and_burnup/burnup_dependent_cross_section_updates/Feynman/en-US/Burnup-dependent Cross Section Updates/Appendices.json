            "problem": "A homogeneous infinite Light Water Reactor (LWR) lattice is operating at constant volumetric power density $p_{0}$ and initially contains no rare earth fission products. Consider a designated set $\\{i=1,\\dots,m\\}$ of rare earth fission products that are produced directly by fission with independent yields $y_{i}$ per fission. Each product $i$ has a decay constant $\\lambda_{i} \\ge 0$ and a groupwise microscopic absorption cross section $\\sigma_{a,i,g}$ in energy group $g$, where $g$ is fixed. Assume the following:\n- The heavy metal mass density is $\\rho_{\\mathrm{HM}}$.\n- The energy released per fission is $E_{f}$.\n- The rare earth fission products are only produced directly from fission and are lost solely by radioactive decay (no neutron absorption removal or chemical removal).\n- The reactor is homogeneous and the neutron field is stationary over the timescale considered, so production is spatially uniform and proportional to $p_{0}$.\n- The initial number density of each rare earth product $i$ is zero at burnup $B=0$.\n\nBurnup $B$ is defined by $B = \\int_{0}^{t} p(t') \\, dt' / \\rho_{\\mathrm{HM}}$, which under the assumption of constant power density equals $B = p_{0} t / \\rho_{\\mathrm{HM}}$.

It is a standard, solvable problem in reactor physics.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the number density $N_i(t)$ for each rare earth fission product $i$ as a function of time $t$, and then express this in terms of burnup $B$ to calculate the change in the macroscopic absorption cross section.\n\nThe number balance for the nuclide $i$ is described by a first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dN_i(t)}{dt} = (\\text{Rate of production of } i) - (\\text{Rate of loss of } i) $$\n\nThe rate of production per unit volume is the product of the fission rate density, $f$, and the fission yield for nuclide $i$, $y_i$. The problem states that the fission rate density is related to the constant volumetric power density $p_0$ and the energy per fission $E_f$ by $f = p_0 / E_f$. Thus, the production rate is a constant, $y_i p_0 / E_f$.\n\nThe rate of loss per unit volume is due solely to radioactive decay. This is given by the product of the decay constant $\\lambda_i$ and the number density $N_i(t)$.\n\nCombining these terms, the differential equation for the number density of nuclide $i$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dN_i(t)}{dt} = \\frac{y_i p_0}{E_f} - \\lambda_i N_i(t) $$\nThis is a linear first-order differential equation. We can rearrange it into the standard form:\n$$ \\frac{dN_i(t)}{dt} + \\lambda_i N_i(t) = \\frac{y_i p_0}{E_f} $$\nThe initial condition, stated in the problem, is $N_i(t=0) = 0$.\n\nWe consider two cases for the decay constant $\\lambda_i$.\n\nCase 1: $\\lambda_i > 0$.\nThe general solution to this differential equation can be found using an integrating factor, $I(t) = \\exp(\\int \\lambda_i dt) = \\exp(\\lambda_i t)$. Multiplying the equation by $I(t)$ gives:\n$$ \\exp(\\lambda_i t) \\frac{dN_i(t)}{dt} + \\lambda_i \\exp(\\lambda_i t) N_i(t) = \\frac{y_i p_0}{E_f} \\exp(\\lambda_i t) $$\nThe left-hand side is the derivative of a product:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( N_i(t) \\exp(\\lambda_i t) \\right) = \\frac{y_i p_0}{E_f} \\exp(\\lambda_i t) $$\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $t$:\n$$ N_i(t) \\exp(\\lambda_i t) = \\int \\frac{y_i p_0}{E_f} \\exp(\\lambda_i t) dt = \\frac{y_i p_0}{E_f \\lambda_i} \\exp(\\lambda_i t) + C $$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. Solving for $N_i(t)$:\n$$ N_i(t) = \\frac{y_i p_0}{E_f \\lambda_i} + C \\exp(-\\lambda_i t) $$\nUsing the initial condition $N_i(0)=0$:\n$$ N_i(0) = 0 = \\frac{y_i p_0}{E_f \\lambda_i} + C \\exp(0) \\implies C = -\\frac{y_i p_0}{E_f \\lambda_i} $$\nSubstituting the value of $C$ back into the solution for $N_i(t)$:\n$$ N_i(t) = \\frac{y_i p_0}{E_f \\lambda_i} - \\frac{y_i p_0}{E_f \\lambda_i} \\exp(-\\lambda_i t) = \\frac{y_i p_0}{E_f \\lambda_i} \\left( 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_i t) \\right) $$\n\nCase 2: $\\lambda_i = 0$ (stable nuclide).\nThe differential equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{dN_i(t)}{dt} = \\frac{y_i p_0}{E_f} $$\nIntegrating with respect to $t$ and applying the initial condition $N_i(0)=0$:\n$$ N_i(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{y_i p_0}{E_f} dt' = \\frac{y_i p_0}{E_f} t $$\nIt is worth noting that the solution for the $\\lambda_i=0$ case can be obtained by taking the limit of the $\\lambda_i > 0$ solution as $\\lambda_i \\to 0$, using the Taylor expansion $\\exp(-x) \\approx 1-x$ for small $x$, or L'Hôpital's rule.\n$$ \\lim_{\\lambda_i \\to 0} \\frac{y_i p_0}{E_f} \\frac{1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_i t)}{\\lambda_i} = \\frac{y_i p_0}{E_f} \\lim_{\\lambda_i \\to 0} \\frac{t \\exp(-\\lambda_i t)}{1} = \\frac{y_i p_0}{E_f} t $$\nThus, the expression for $\\lambda_i>0$ is suitable for all $\\lambda_i \\ge 0$ when the limit is taken for $\\lambda_i=0$.\n\nNext, we express the time variable $t$ in terms of burnup $B$. The problem defines $B = p_0 t / \\rho_{\\mathrm{HM}}$. Rearranging for $t$ gives:\n$$ t = \\frac{B \\rho_{\\mathrm{HM}}}{p_0} $$\nSubstituting this into the general expression for $N_i(t)$ yields $N_i(B)$:\n$$ N_i(B) = \\frac{y_i p_0}{E_f \\lambda_i} \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\lambda_i \\frac{B \\rho_{\\mathrm{HM}}}{p_0}\\right) \\right) $$\n\nThe change in the macroscopic absorption cross section in energy group $g$, $\\Delta \\Sigma_{a,g}(B)$, is the difference between the macroscopic cross section at burnup $B$ and at burnup $B=0$.\n$$ \\Delta \\Sigma_{a,g}(B) = \\Sigma_{a,g}(B) - \\Sigma_{a,g}(0) $$\nThe macroscopic cross section at any burnup is the sum of the contributions from all $m$ fission products:\n$$ \\Sigma_{a,g}(B) = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} N_i(B) \\sigma_{a,i,g} $$\nAt burnup $B=0$, the number densities are $N_i(0)=0$, so $\\Sigma_{a,g}(0) = 0$.\nTherefore, the change is simply $\\Delta \\Sigma_{a,g}(B) = \\Sigma_{a,g}(B)$.\n$$ \\Delta \\Sigma_{a,g}(B) = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} N_i(B) \\sigma_{a,i,g} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $N_i(B)$:\n$$ \\Delta \\Sigma_{a,g}(B) = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\sigma_{a,i,g} \\left[ \\frac{y_i p_0}{E_f \\lambda_i} \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\lambda_i \\frac{B \\rho_{\\mathrm{HM}}}{p_0}\\right) \\right) \\right] $$\nRearranging the terms to group the constants gives the final closed-form expression:\n$$ \\Delta \\Sigma_{a,g}(B) = \\frac{p_0}{E_f} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\frac{y_i \\sigma_{a,i,g}}{\\lambda_i} \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda_i \\rho_{\\mathrm{HM}}}{p_0} B \\right) \\right) $$\nThis expression is valid for all $\\lambda_i \\ge 0$, with the understanding that for any term where $\\lambda_i = 0$, the expression $\\frac{1}{\\lambda_i} \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda_i \\rho_{\\mathrm{HM}}}{p_0} B \\right) \\right)$ is replaced by its limit, which is $\\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{HM}}}{p_0} B$.\nThis gives the contribution for a stable nuclide as $\\frac{p_0}{E_f} y_i \\sigma_{a,i,g} \\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{HM}}}{p_0} B = \\frac{y_i \\sigma_{a,i,g} \\rho_{\\mathrm{HM}}}{E_f} B$, which matches the direct calculation from $N_i(B) = \\frac{y_i B \\rho_{\\mathrm{HM}}}{E_f}$.\nThe final single expression is presented as requested, with the limit interpretation implied for any $\\lambda_i=0$.",

This is because $\\bar{\\Sigma}_f \\bar{\\phi} = \\frac{\\int \\Sigma_f \\phi dt}{\\int \\phi dt} \\frac{\\int \\phi dt}{h} = \\frac{1}{h} \\int \\Sigma_f \\phi dt = R_{\\mathrm{avg}}$. Thus, the step-averaged method is exact by definition, having zero error.\nThe endpoint value method, $\\widehat{R}_{\\mathrm{end}}$, has a truncation error $\\Delta$ with a leading term of $\\frac{1}{2} \\Sigma_1 \\phi_0 h$. This error is first-order in the step size $h$, meaning the method is zeroth-order accurate. The step-averaged cross section method improves accuracy over the endpoint value method whenever $\\Delta \\neq 0$. For a non-trivial reactor state ($\\phi_0 > 0$) and a finite time step ($h > 0$), this condition holds if $\\Sigma_1 \\neq 0$. The coefficient $\\Sigma_1 = \\left.\\frac{d\\Sigma_f}{dt}\\right|_{t=0}$ represents the initial rate of change of the fission cross section. Therefore, the use of the step-averaged cross section provides an improvement whenever the cross section is not constant in time, i.e., when it has a non-zero first time derivative.

In this final exercise, you will design a practical adaptive burnup-stepping criterion, a technique used in real-world codes to control step size based on the rate of change of key physical parameters. By balancing prescribed error tolerances against the burnup derivatives of cross sections, you will determine the optimal step size to ensure a stable and efficient calculation .",

            "problem": "Consider a two-energy-group, infinite homogeneous reactor model used for burnup-dependent transport calculations. Let the burnup, defined as energy produced per unit heavy metal mass, be $B(t)$, with the fundamental definition $B(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} P_{\\mathrm{th}}(\\tau)/M_{\\mathrm{HM}} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\tau$, where $P_{\\mathrm{th}}$ is the thermal power and $M_{\\mathrm{HM}}$ is the heavy metal (HM) mass. The macroscopic cross sections $\\Sigma_{x,g}(B)$ for reaction type $x$ in energy group $g$ are functions of burnup because the number densities evolve according to transmutation and depletion. For a small burnup increment $\\Delta B$, assume a first-order linearization of each cross section, $\\Delta \\Sigma_{x,g} \\approx \\left(\\partial \\Sigma_{x,g}/\\partial B\\right) \\Delta B$.\n\nTo ensure numerical stability and physics fidelity in an adaptive time-stepping (burnup-stepping) scheme, you wish to constrain the relative change in each key macroscopic cross section per burnup step to be below prescribed tolerances. Specifically, impose $|\\Delta \\Sigma_{x,g}|/\\Sigma_{x,g} \\leq \\varepsilon_{x,g}$ for the set of monitored reactions $x \\in \\{a, f, s\\}$ (absorption, fission, and scattering) and energy groups $g \\in \\{1,2\\}$, with tolerances $\\varepsilon_{a,1}=\\varepsilon_{a,2}=\\varepsilon_{f,2}=0.010$ and $\\varepsilon_{s,1\\rightarrow 2}=0.005$.\n\nAt the current burnup $B_{0}$, the following macroscopic cross sections and their burnup derivatives (evaluated at $B_{0}$) are measured:\n- Fast-group absorption: $\\Sigma_{a,1}(B_{0}) = 0.015 \\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ and $\\frac{\\partial \\Sigma_{a,1}}{\\partial B} \\big|_{B_{0}} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\text{cm}^{-1} \\cdot (\\text{MWd}/\\text{kgHM})^{-1}$.\n- Thermal-group absorption: $\\Sigma_{a,2}(B_{0}) = 0.095 \\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ and $\\frac{\\partial \\Sigma_{a,2}}{\\partial B} \\big|_{B_{0}} = 3.5 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\text{cm}^{-1} \\cdot (\\text{MWd}/\\text{kgHM})^{-1}$.\n- Thermal-group fission: $\\Sigma_{f,2}(B_{0}) = 0.025 \\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ and $\\frac{\\partial \\Sigma_{f,2}}{\\partial B} \\big|_{B_{0}} = -2.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\text{cm}^{-1} \\cdot (\\text{MWd}/\\text{kgHM})^{-1}$.\n- Down-scattering from fast to thermal: $\\Sigma_{s,1\\rightarrow 2}(B_{0}) = 0.200 \\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ and $\\frac{\\partial \\Sigma_{s,1\\rightarrow 2}}{\\partial B} \\big|_{B_{0}} = -1.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\text{cm}^{-1} \\cdot (\\text{MWd}/\\text{kgHM})^{-1}$.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definitions above, derive an adaptive burnup-step criterion that guarantees $|\\Delta \\Sigma_{x,g}|/\\Sigma_{x,g} \\leq \\varepsilon_{x,g}$ for all monitored $x,g$ in a single step.

A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\nThe core requirement is to limit the relative change in each monitored macroscopic cross section $\\Sigma_{x,g}$ during a burnup step $\\Delta B$. The constraint for each reaction type $x$ in energy group $g$ is given as:\n$$\n\\frac{|\\Delta \\Sigma_{x,g}|}{\\Sigma_{x,g}(B_0)} \\leq \\varepsilon_{x,g}\n$$\nThe problem specifies using a first-order Taylor expansion to approximate the change $\\Delta \\Sigma_{x,g}$ over a small burnup increment $\\Delta B$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\Sigma_{x,g} \\approx \\left. \\frac{\\partial \\Sigma_{x,g}}{\\partial B} \\right|_{B_0} \\Delta B\n$$\nSubstituting this approximation into the constraint inequality yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\left| \\left. \\frac{\\partial \\Sigma_{x,g}}{\\partial B} \\right|_{B_0} \\Delta B \\right|}{\\Sigma_{x,g}(B_0)} \\leq \\varepsilon_{x,g}\n$$\nSince the burnup increment $\\Delta B$ must be positive, we can write $|\\Delta B| = \\Delta B$. The inequality can then be rearranged to solve for the maximum allowable $\\Delta B$ for that specific cross section, which we denote as $\\Delta B_{x,g}$:\n$$\n\\Delta B \\frac{\\left| \\left. \\frac{\\partial \\Sigma_{x,g}}{\\partial B} \\right|_{B_0} \\right|}{\\Sigma_{x,g}(B_0)} \\leq \\varepsilon_{x,g} \\implies \\Delta B \\leq \\frac{\\varepsilon_{x,g} \\Sigma_{x,g}(B_0)}{\\left| \\left. \\frac{\\partial \\Sigma_{x,g}}{\\partial B} \\right|_{B_0} \\right|}\n$$\nThus, for each monitored cross-section $(x,g)$, the maximum permitted burnup step is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta B_{x,g} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{x,g} \\Sigma_{x,g}(B_0)}{\\left| \\frac{\\partial \\Sigma_{x,g}}{\\partial B} \\Big|_{B_0} \\right|}\n$$\nThis is the adaptive burnup-step criterion for a single cross section. To ensure that all constraints are met simultaneously, the overall maximum allowable burnup increment, $\\Delta B_{\\max}$, must be the minimum of the individual step sizes calculated for all monitored reactions.\n$$\n\\Delta B_{\\max} = \\min_{x,g \\in \\text{monitored}} \\left\\{ \\Delta B_{x,g} \\right\\}\n$$\nWe now compute $\\Delta B_{x,g}$ for each of the four specified cases using the provided data.
