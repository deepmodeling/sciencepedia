All necessary information is provided, and the problem is self-contained and unambiguous.\n\nThe Functional Expansion Tally (FET) coefficients, $a_{mn}$, are defined by the inner product of the function to be expanded, $f(\\mathbf{r})$, with the basis functions, $\\psi_{mn}(\\mathbf{r})$, over the domain $D$ with a weight function $w(\\mathbf{r})$. The given definition is:\n$$a_{mn}=\\int_{D} f(\\mathbf{r})\\,\\psi_{mn}(\\mathbf{r})\\,w(\\mathbf{r})\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}$$\nThe problem provides the following specifics:\n- The domain is $D=[-1,1]\\times[-1,1]$.\n- The function is a uniform scalar flux, $f(\\mathbf{r})=\\phi_{0}$.\n- The weight function is $w(\\mathbf{r})=1$.\n- The two-dimensional basis functions are a tensor product of one-dimensional basis functions: $\\psi_{mn}(x,y)=\\varphi_{m}(x)\\varphi_{n}(y)$.\n\nSubstituting these into the definition, the integral becomes:\n$$a_{mn}=\\int_{-1}^{1}\\int_{-1}^{1} \\phi_{0} \\cdot \\varphi_{m}(x)\\varphi_{n}(y) \\cdot 1 \\,\\mathrm{d}x\\mathrm{d}y$$\nSince $\\phi_{0}$ is a constant, it can be factored out.

The problem states they are proportional to the usual Legendre polynomials, $P_{n}(x)$, and are orthonormal on $[-1,1]$ with weight $w(x)=1$.\n\nThe standard orthogonality relation for Legendre polynomials is:\n$$\\int_{-1}^{1} P_{m}(x)P_{n}(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\frac{2}{2n+1}\\delta_{mn}$$\nwhere $\\delta_{mn}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nLet the orthonormal functions be $\\varphi_{n}(x) = C_{n}P_{n}(x)$, where $C_{n}$ is a normalization constant. The orthonormality condition is:\n$$\\int_{-1}^{1} \\varphi_{m}(x)\\varphi_{n}(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\delta_{mn}$$\nSubstituting $\\varphi_{n}(x) = C_{n}P_{n}(x)$:\n$$\\int_{-1}^{1} \\big(C_{m}P_{m}(x)\\big)\\big(C_{n}P_{n}(x)\\big)\\,\\mathrm{d}x = C_{m}C_{n} \\int_{-1}^{1} P_{m}(x)P_{n}(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x = C_{m}C_{n} \\frac{2}{2n+1}\\delta_{mn}$$\nFor $m=n$, this becomes $C_{n}^2 \\frac{2}{2n+1}$.

The Legendre polynomials $\\{P_n(x)\\}$ form an orthogonal set on the interval $[-1, 1]$ with weight function $w(x)=1$. The orthogonality relation is:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} P_m(x) P_n(x) \\,dx = \\frac{2}{2n+1} \\delta_{mn}\n$$\nwhere $\\delta_{mn}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nThe function $f(x)$ is to be represented by the series $f(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n P_n(x)$. To find the coefficient $a_k$, we multiply this equation by $P_k(x)$ and integrate over $[-1, 1]$:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} f(x) P_k(x) \\,dx = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\left( \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n P_n(x) \\right) P_k(x) \\,dx\n$$\nBy linearity of the integral and orthogonality, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} f(x) P_k(x) \\,dx = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n \\int_{-1}^{1} P_n(x) P_k(x) \\,dx = a_k \\frac{2}{2k+1}\n$$\nSolving for $a_k$ (and relabeling the index to $n$) gives the general formula for the coefficients:\n$$\na_n = \\frac{2n+1}{2} \\int_{-1}^{1} f(x) P_n(x) \\,dx\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given piecewise definition of $f(x)$:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} f(x) P_n(x) \\,dx = \\int_{-1}^{0} (0) \\cdot P_n(x) \\,dx + \\int_{0}^{1} (1) \\cdot P_n(x) \\,dx = \\int_{0}^{1} P_n(x) \\,dx\n$$\nTherefore, the general expression for the coefficients $a_n$ is:\n$$\na_n = \\frac{2n+1}{2} \\int_{0}^{1} P_n(x) \\,dx\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nNext, we must evaluate $f_N(0) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N} a_n P_n(0)$. This requires evaluating $a_n$ and $P_n(0)$. We consider two cases for the index $n$: even and odd.\n\nA key property of Legendre polynomials is that $P_n(x)$ is an even function for even $n$ and an odd function for odd $n$. This implies that for all odd integers $n$:\n$$\nP_n(0) = 0 \\quad (\\text{for } n = 1, 3, 5, \\dots)\n$$\nAs a result, all terms with an odd index $n$ in the sum for $f_N(0)$ are zero, irrespective of the value of $a_n$. The sum simplifies to include only even-indexed terms:\n$$\nf_N(0) = \\sum_{k=0, \\, 2k \\le N} a_{2k} P_{2k}(0)\n$$\nNow we analyze the coefficients $a_n$ for even $n$.\nFor $n=0$, $P_0(x)=1$. The coefficient $a_0$ is:\n$$\na_0 = \\frac{2(0)+1}{2} \\int_{0}^{1} P_0(x) \\,dx = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{1} 1 \\,dx = \\frac{1}{2} [x]_{0}^{1} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThe first term of the sum is $a_0 P_0(0) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nFor even $n \\ge 2$, we use the recurrence relation for Legendre polynomials:\n$$\nP'_{n+1}(x) - P'_{n-1}(x) = (2n+1)P_n(x)\n$$\nIntegrating this identity from $0$ to $1$ gives:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{1} (P'_{n+1}(x) - P'_{n-1}(x)) \\,dx = (2n+1) \\int_{0}^{1} P_n(x) \\,dx\n$$\n$$\n[P_{n+1}(x) - P_{n-1}(x)]_{0}^{1} = (2n+1) \\int_{0}^{1} P_n(x) \\,dx\n$$\nUsing the property $P_m(1)=1$ for any $m$, the left side becomes:\n$$\n(P_{n+1}(1) - P_{n-1}(1)) - (P_{n+1}(0) - P_{n-1}(0)) = (1-1) - (P_{n+1}(0) - P_{n-1}(0)) = P_{n-1}(0) - P_{n+1}(0)\n$$\nThus, for $n \\ge 1$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{1} P_n(x) \\,dx = \\frac{P_{n-1}(0) - P_{n+1}(0)}{2n+1}\n$$\nNow consider an even index $n=2k$ where $k \\ge 1$. Both $n-1=2k-1$ and $n+1=2k+1$ are odd integers. As established, $P_m(0)=0$ for any odd $m$. Therefore:\n$$\nP_{2k-1}(0) = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad P_{2k+1}(0) = 0\n$$\nThis leads to:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{1} P_{2k}(x) \\,dx = \\frac{P_{2k-1}(0) - P_{2k+1}(0)}{2(2k)+1} = \\frac{0-0}{4k+1} = 0 \\quad (\\text{for } k \\ge 1)\n$$\nThe coefficient $a_{2k}$ is then:\n$$\na_{2k} = \\frac{2(2k)+1}{2} \\int_{0}^{1} P_{2k}(x) \\,dx = \\frac{4k+1}{2} \\cdot 0 = 0 \\quad (\\text{for } k \\ge 1)\n$$\nSo, all coefficients $a_n$ are zero for even indices $n \\ge 2$.\n\nCombining our findings for $f_N(0)$:\n1. Terms for odd $n$ are zero because $P_n(0) = 0$.\n2. Terms for even $n \\ge 2$ are zero because $a_n = 0$.\n3. The only non-zero term is for $n=0$.\n\nTherefore, for any truncation order $N \\ge 0$, the sum reduces to its first term:\n$$\nf_N(0) = a_0 P_0(0) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThis completes the second part of the problem.\n\nFinally, we compute the interface bias $b_N$, defined as:\n$$\nb_N \\equiv \\lim_{x\\to 0^+} f(x) - f_N(0)\n$$\nFrom the definition of the true flux, for any $x \\in (0, 1]$, we have $f(x)=1$. Thus, the right-sided limit at the interface is:\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} f(x) = 1\n$$\nWe found that $f_N(0) = \\frac{1}{2}$ for any $N \\ge 0$. Substituting these values into the definition of bias:\n$$\nb_N = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThe interface bias is a constant value of $\\frac{1}{2}$, independent of the truncation order $N$. This is a well-known result related to the Gibbs phenomenon for projecting a step discontinuity onto an orthogonal polynomial basis. The series converges to the arithmetic mean of the left and right limits at the point of discontinuity. The bias as defined is the difference between the true right-side value and this converged midpoint value.",
