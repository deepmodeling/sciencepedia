No numerical evaluation is required, and no rounding is needed.\"\n\nThis problem is deemed **valid** following a rigorous validation process. It is scientifically grounded in standard particle transport theory, well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient information, and uses objective, formal language. It represents a fundamental calculation in the field of nuclear reactor simulation.\n\nThe objective is to compute the expected value of the random variable $D_{\\text{leak}}$, denoted as $\\mathbb{E}[D_{\\text{leak}}]$. This variable represents the distance a particle travels before leaking through the boundary at $x=H$.\n\nFirst, we characterize the particle's trajectory. The particle starts at position $x_0$ and travels with a direction cosine $\\mu$ with respect to the $+x$ axis. The position of the particle after traveling a path length $s$ is given by $x(s) = x_0 + \\mu s$. Since the particle is born with $\\mu \\in (0,1)$, it is moving towards the boundary at $x=H$.\n\nThe distance the particle must travel to reach the boundary at $x=H$ is a deterministic quantity. Let this distance be $s_H$. We find $s_H$ by setting $x(s_H) = H$:\n$$H = x_0 + \\mu s_H$$\nSolving for $s_H$ yields:\n$$s_H = \\frac{H - x_0}{\\mu}$$\nSince $x_0  H$ and $\\mu  0$, we have $s_H  0$.\n\nThe particle's life is determined by a competition between two mutually exclusive events:\n$1$. The particle travels a distance $s_H$ without collision and leaks from the system at $x=H$.\n$2$. The particle undergoes a collision before traveling the distance $s_H$.\n\nThe distance to the first collision, $S$, is a random variable governed by the exponential distribution. The probability density function (PDF) is $f_S(s) = \\Sigma_t \\exp(-\\Sigma_t s)$ for $s \\ge 0$, and the survival probability (the complement of the cumulative distribution function) is given as $\\mathbb{P}(S  s) = \\exp(-\\Sigma_t s)$.\n\nWe can now define the random variable $D_{\\text{leak}}$ more formally in terms of the free-flight distance $S$ and the distance to the boundary $s_H$:\n- If the particle leaks (Event L), it means the sampled free-flight distance $S$ is greater than the distance to the boundary, $s_H$. In this case, the particle travels exactly the distance $s_H$ to the boundary. According to the problem definition, $D_{\\text{leak}} = s_H$. This event is $S  s_H$.\n- If the particle collides before leaking (Event C), it means the sampled free-flight distance $S$ is less than or equal to the distance to the boundary, $s_H$. The problem states that in this case, $D_{\\text{leak}}$ is defined to be $0$. This event is $S \\le s_H$.\n\nSo, we have:\n$$D_{\\text{leak}} = \\begin{cases} s_H  \\text{if } S  s_H \\\\ 0  \\text{if } S \\le s_H \\end{cases}$$\n\nThe expected value of $D_{\\text{leak}}$ can be calculated using the law of total expectation, by summing the value of $D_{\\text{leak}}$ for each event multiplied by the probability of that event:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[D_{\\text{leak}}] = (s_H) \\cdot \\mathbb{P}(\\text{Event L}) + (0) \\cdot \\mathbb{P}(\\text{Event C})$$\n$$\\mathbb{E}[D_{\\text{leak}}] = s_H \\cdot \\mathbb{P}(S  s_H)$$\n\nWe need to calculate the probability of leakage, $\\mathbb{P}(S  s_H)$. Using the given survival probability function $\\mathbb{P}(S  s) = \\exp(-\\Sigma_t s)$, we can substitute $s = s_H$:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(S  s_H) = \\exp(-\\Sigma_t s_H)$$\n\nNow, we substitute this probability and the expression for $s_H$ into the formula for the expected value:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[D_{\\text{leak}}] = s_H \\cdot \\exp(-\\Sigma_t s_H)$$\nSubstituting $s_H = \\frac{H - x_0}{\\mu}$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[D_{\\text{leak}}] = \\left(\\frac{H - x_0}{\\mu}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\Sigma_t \\frac{H - x_0}{\\mu}\\right)$$\n\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the expected distance to vacuum leakage in terms of the given parameters $\\Sigma_t$, $x_0$, $\\mu$, and $H$.",

            "problem": "In neutral particle transport for nuclear reactor simulation, the neutron's streaming between interactions is governed by the linear Boltzmann transport equation, whose deterministic streaming term states that a particle at position $\\mathbf{r}$ with direction $\\hat{\\Omega}$ advances along the parametric ray $\\mathbf{r}(s)=\\mathbf{r}+s\\,\\hat{\\Omega}$ until it either interacts in the medium or encounters a boundary. In Monte Carlo (MC) simulation, the free-flight distance to the next collision is sampled from an exponential distribution determined by the total macroscopic cross section, and potential boundary crossings are located by geometric intersection of $\\mathbf{r}(s)$ with the boundary surface. Consider a planar face of a convex cell described by a plane with outward unit normal $\\mathbf{n}$ and a known point $\\mathbf{r}_{0}$ on the plane, so that any point $\\mathbf{x}$ on the plane satisfies $\\mathbf{n}\\cdot(\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{r}_{0})=0$.

Using your derivation from part (a), compute the physically realized streaming distance $s$ as the minimum of the admissible boundary distance and the sampled collision distance. Express the final distance $s$ in meters, and round your result to six significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is divided into two parts. Part (a) requires the derivation of the distance to a planar boundary and an analysis of the physically admissible conditions, including the numerical treatment of near-parallel trajectories. Part (b) requires applying these principles to compute a specific streaming distance for a neutron in a Monte Carlo simulation.\n\n(a) Derivation and Analysis of Boundary Intersection\n\nA neutron travels along a straight line path between interactions. Its position $\\mathbf{r}(s)$ at a distance $s$ along its flight path from its current position $\\mathbf{r}$ is given by the parametric ray equation:\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}(s) = \\mathbf{r} + s\\,\\hat{\\Omega}\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{\\Omega}$ is the unit vector representing the neutron's direction of travel.\n\nThe planar face of the geometry is described by the set of all points $\\mathbf{x}$ satisfying the equation:\n$$\n\\mathbf{n}\\cdot(\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{r}_{0})=0\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{n}$ is the outward-pointing unit normal to the plane and $\\mathbf{r}_{0}$ is a known point on the plane.\n\nTo find the distance-to-boundary, denoted by $s_{b}$, we must find the value of the parameter $s$ for which the neutron's path intersects the plane. This occurs when $\\mathbf{r}(s_{b})$ satisfies the plane equation. Substituting the ray equation into the plane equation gives:\n$$\n\\mathbf{n}\\cdot((\\mathbf{r} + s_{b}\\,\\hat{\\Omega}) - \\mathbf{r}_{0}) = 0\n$$\nWe can rearrange this equation using the distributive property of the dot product:\n$$\n\\mathbf{n}\\cdot(\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r}_{0}) + \\mathbf{n}\\cdot(s_{b}\\,\\hat{\\Omega}) = 0\n$$\nSince $s_{b}$ is a scalar, we can factor it out of the second dot product:\n$$\n\\mathbf{n}\\cdot(\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r}_{0}) + s_{b}\\,(\\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\hat{\\Omega}) = 0\n$$\nSolving for the distance-to-boundary $s_{b}$ yields:\n$$\ns_{b}\\,(\\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\hat{\\Omega}) = -\\mathbf{n}\\cdot(\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r}_{0}) = \\mathbf{n}\\cdot(\\mathbf{r}_{0} - \\mathbf{r})\n$$\n$$\ns_{b} = \\frac{\\mathbf{n}\\cdot(\\mathbf{r}_{0} - \\mathbf{r})}{\\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\hat{\\Omega}}\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the distance from point $\\mathbf{r}$ to the plane along the direction $\\hat{\\Omega}$.\n\nNext, we identify the conditions under which this distance is physically admissible.\n$1$. The neutron must travel a positive distance to reach the boundary. Thus, we must have $s_{b}  0$.\n$2$. The point $\\mathbf{r}$ is stated to be *inside* the convex cell. Since $\\mathbf{n}$ is the *outward* unit normal, the vector from a point on the plane ($\\mathbf{r}_0$) to the particle's position ($\\mathbf{r}$) must have a component that opposes $\\mathbf{n}$. Mathematically, this means $\\mathbf{n}\\cdot(\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r}_{0})  0$. Consequently, the numerator of the expression for $s_{b}$, which is $\\mathbf{n}\\cdot(\\mathbf{r}_{0} - \\mathbf{r})$, must be positive.\n$3$. For $s_{b} = \\frac{\\mathbf{n}\\cdot(\\mathbf{r}_{0} - \\mathbf{r})}{\\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\hat{\\Omega}}$ to be positive, given a positive numerator, the denominator $\\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\hat{\\Omega}$ must also be positive. A value of $\\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\hat{\\Omega}  0$ signifies that the neutron's direction vector $\\hat{\\Omega}$ has a component along the outward normal $\\mathbf{n}$, meaning the neutron is moving towards the boundary, which is the necessary condition for an intersection to occur in the forward direction. If $\\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\hat{\\Omega} \\le 0$, the neutron is moving parallel to or away from the boundary and will not intersect it (in the positive $s$ direction), so $s_b$ is not a valid positive distance.\n\nTherefore, the condition for a physically admissible forward intersection is $\\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\hat{\\Omega}  0$.\n\nNow we consider the near-parallel edge case where $\\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\hat{\\Omega} \\approx 0$.\nFrom first principles, if a neutron's path is exactly parallel to the plane, then $\\hat{\\Omega}$ is orthogonal to $\\mathbf{n}$, and $\\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\hat{\\Omega} = 0$. In this case, the denominator of the expression for $s_b$ is zero, and the distance to intersection is infinite, which is physically correct.\nIn a computer simulation using finite-precision arithmetic (e.g., floating-point numbers), a value that is mathematically zero may be represented by a very small non-zero number due to rounding errors in previous calculations of $\\mathbf{r}$ or $\\hat{\\Omega}$. If $\\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\hat{\\Omega}$ is a very small non-zero number, its direct use in the division can cause severe numerical instability:\n- If $\\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\hat{\\Omega}$ is a small positive number (e.g., $10^{-15}$), $s_{b}$ becomes an enormous positive number, potentially causing an overflow.\n- If, due to a slight numerical error, $\\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\hat{\\Omega}$ becomes a small negative number, $s_{b}$ would be calculated as a large-magnitude negative distance, incorrectly implying an intersection in the backward direction.\nThe result is extremely sensitive to minute errors in the dot product. To ensure the robustness of the simulation, a tolerance $\\tau  0$ is introduced. Before computing $s_{b}$, the absolute value of the denominator is checked:\nIf $|\\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\hat{\\Omega}|  \\tau$, the ray is treated as being effectively parallel to the plane. In this scenario, the algorithm does not calculate the division. Instead, it concludes that no intersection will occur, and the distance to this boundary is set to a value representing infinity. This prevents the division by a near-zero number and yields a physically consistent result for near-parallel trajectories, which would travel a very long distance within the cell before hitting that specific face.\n\n(b) Calculation of Streaming Distance\n\nFirst, we define the given parameters:\n- Outward normal: $\\mathbf{n}=(0,0,1)$.\n- Point on plane: $\\mathbf{r}_{0}=\\big(0,0,5.0\\times 10^{-3}\\big)\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n- Neutron position: $\\mathbf{r}=\\big(1.0\\times 10^{-3},\\,2.0\\times 10^{-3},\\,4.9\\times 10^{-3}\\big)\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n- Unnormalized neutron direction: $\\mathbf{v} = (1,\\,0,\\,10^{-12})$.\n- Total macroscopic cross section: $\\Sigma_{t}=50\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$.\n- Random number for sampling: $\\xi=0.2$.\n- Near-parallel tolerance: $\\tau=1.0\\times 10^{-10}$.\n\nThe realised streaming distance $s$ is the minimum of two quantities: the sampled distance to the next collision, $s_{c}$, and the admissible distance to the boundary, $s_{b}$.\n$$\ns = \\min(s_{c}, s_{b})\n$$\n\n1. Calculate the sampled collision distance $s_{c}$.\nIn Monte Carlo methods, the distance to collision is sampled from the probability distribution $p(s) = \\Sigma_{t}\\exp(-\\Sigma_{t}s)$ by inverting its cumulative distribution function. This leads to the formula:\n$$\ns_{c} = -\\frac{1}{\\Sigma_{t}}\\ln(\\xi)\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\ns_{c} = -\\frac{1}{50\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}}\\ln(0.2) = \\frac{\\ln(5)}{50}\\,\\mathrm{m} \\approx 0.032188758\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\n\n2. Calculate the distance to the boundary $s_{b}$.\nFirst, we must normalize the direction vector $\\mathbf{v}$:\n$$\n\\|\\mathbf{v}\\| = \\sqrt{1^{2} + 0^{2} + (10^{-12})^{2}} = \\sqrt{1 + 10^{-24}}\n$$\nThe unit direction vector is $\\hat{\\Omega} = \\frac{\\mathbf{v}}{\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|} = \\frac{(1,\\,0,\\,10^{-12})}{\\sqrt{1 + 10^{-24}}}$.\n\nNext, we follow the procedure from part (a). We compute the denominator for $s_{b}$, which we denote $\\mu = \\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\hat{\\Omega}$.\n$$\n\\mu = \\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\hat{\\Omega} = (0,0,1)\\cdot\\frac{(1,\\,0,\\,10^{-12})}{\\sqrt{1 + 10^{-24}}} = \\frac{10^{-12}}{\\sqrt{1 + 10^{-24}}}\n$$\nThe value $\\sqrt{1+10^{-24}}$ is negligibly different from $1$, so $\\mu \\approx 10^{-12}$.\nNow, we apply the near-parallel tolerance check. We compare $|\\mu|$ with $\\tau$:\n$$\n|\\mu| = \\frac{10^{-12}}{\\sqrt{1 + 10^{-24}}}  10^{-12}\n$$\nSince $\\tau = 1.0\\times 10^{-10}$, the condition $|\\mu|  \\tau$ is met because $10^{-12}  10^{-10}$.\n\nAccording to the rule established in part (a), the ray is treated as parallel to the plane. Therefore, we do not compute $s_b$ via division. Instead, the distance to this boundary is considered infinite for the purpose of determining the next event. So, we set $s_{b} = \\infty$.\n\n3. Determine the final streaming distance $s$.\nThe streaming distance is the minimum of the collision and boundary distances:\n$$\ns = \\min(s_{c}, s_{b}) = \\min\\left(\\frac{\\ln(5)}{50}\\,\\mathrm{m}, \\infty\\right) = \\frac{\\ln(5)}{50}\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe neutron will have a collision within the cell before it reaches the boundary.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value and round to six significant figures:\n$$\ns = \\frac{\\ln(5)}{50} \\approx 0.03218875824... \\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nRounding to six significant figures gives:\n$$\ns \\approx 0.0321888\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$",

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of particle transport and stochastic processes, well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient data, and expressed in objective, unambiguous language. The problem is a formalizable exercise in probability theory that is directly relevant to Monte Carlo methods in nuclear reactor simulation. It contains no scientific flaws, contradictions, or unrealistic conditions. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability mass function (PMF) of the random variable $K$, which represents the total number of reflections a particle undergoes at a boundary before it is absorbed, and its expectation $\\mathbb{E}[K]$. The particle undergoes a sequence of statistically independent interactions with the boundary. At each interaction, the particle is reflected with probability $\\alpha$ and absorbed with probability $1-\\alpha$, where $0  \\alpha  1$.\n\nFirst, we derive the PMF, denoted as $p_K(k) = P(K=k)$, for $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$.
