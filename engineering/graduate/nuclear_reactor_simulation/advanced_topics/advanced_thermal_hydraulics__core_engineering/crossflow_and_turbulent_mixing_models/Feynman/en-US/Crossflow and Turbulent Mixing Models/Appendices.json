            "problem": "In subchannel-based nuclear reactor thermal-hydraulics, lateral turbulent mixing across the narrow gap separating two adjacent subchannels is often modeled as diffusion across a planar slab. Consider two identical, perfectly mixed subchannel control volumes, each of volume $V$, separated by a rectangular gap of thickness $b$ and interfacial area $A$ (per unit axial length). A passive scalar concentration $c$ is transported laterally across the gap solely by turbulent diffusion, with an effective turbulent diffusivity $D_{t}$ that is spatially uniform and constant in time. Assume that the diffusive time scale across the gap, $t_{d} \\sim b^{2}/D_{t}$, is much shorter than the evolution time scale of the subchannel-averaged concentrations, so that the gap concentration profile is quasi-steady and linear at each instant.\n\nStarting from species conservation and Fick’s law, derive the analytical solution for the transient evolution of the well-mixed subchannel concentrations $C_{1}(t)$ and $C_{2}(t)$ given the initial values $C_{1}(0)=C_{1,0}$ and $C_{2}(0)=C_{2,0}$. Then, using your derived solution, determine the time $t_{\\varepsilon}$ required for the concentrations everywhere in the gap and both subchannels to be within a specified relative tolerance $\\varepsilon$ of the final equilibrium concentration. Take the maximum deviation criterion with respect to the final equilibrium concentration, and use the fact that the gap profile is linear at each time.\n\nUse the following data:\n- Subchannel volumes: $V = 2.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m^{3}}$ (each).\n- Gap thickness: $b = 2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n- Interfacial area: $A = 1.5 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}}$.\n- Turbulent diffusivity: $D_{t} = 8.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}}$.\n- Initial concentrations: $C_{1,0} = 1.2\\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$, $C_{2,0} = 0.0\\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$.\n- Relative tolerance: $\\varepsilon = 0.01$.\n\nExpress the time $t_{\\varepsilon}$ in seconds and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the transient concentration profiles in two coupled subchannels and the subsequent calculation of the time required to reach a specified tolerance from equilibrium. The solution proceeds by first establishing the governing differential equations from first principles, solving them, and then applying the given criterion.\n\nThe foundation of the model rests on two principles: species conservation for a passive scalar and Fick's first law of diffusion.\n\nLet $C_{1}(t)$ and $C_{2}(t)$ be the spatially uniform concentrations in subchannel $1$ and subchannel $2$ at time $t$, respectively. Each subchannel has a volume $V$. The rate of change of mass of the scalar in subchannel $1$ is given by the mass balance equation:\n$$\nV \\frac{dC_{1}}{dt} = \\dot{m}_{2\\rightarrow1}\n$$\nwhere $\\dot{m}_{2\\rightarrow1}$ is the mass flow rate of the scalar from subchannel $2$ into subchannel $1$. By conservation of mass, the rate for subchannel $2$ is:\n$$\nV \\frac{dC_{2}}{dt} = \\dot{m}_{1\\rightarrow2} = -\\dot{m}_{2\\rightarrow1}\n$$\nThe mass flow rate is the product of the mass flux $J_{2\\rightarrow1}$ and the interfacial area $A$. The flux is described by Fick's law:\n$$\nJ_{2\\rightarrow1} = -D_{t} \\frac{dc}{dx}\n$$\nwhere $D_{t}$ is the turbulent diffusivity and $x$ is the spatial coordinate across the gap of thickness $b$, with $x=0$ at the interface with subchannel $1$ and $x=b$ at the interface with subchannel $2$.\n\nThe problem states that the concentration profile $c(x,t)$ in the gap is quasi-steady and linear. At any time $t$, the concentrations at the gap boundaries are the well-mixed subchannel concentrations, i.e., $c(0,t) = C_{1}(t)$ and $c(b,t) = C_{2}(t)$. The linear profile is therefore:\n$$\nc(x,t) = C_{1}(t) + \\frac{C_{2}(t) - C_{1}(t)}{b} x\n$$\nThe concentration gradient across the gap is constant:\n$$\n\\frac{dc}{dx} = \\frac{C_{2}(t) - C_{1}(t)}{b}\n$$\nSubstituting this into Fick's law gives the flux into subchannel $1$:\n$$\nJ_{2\\rightarrow1} = -D_{t} \\left( \\frac{C_{2}(t) - C_{1}(t)}{b} \\right) = \\frac{D_{t}}{b} (C_{1}(t) - C_{2}(t))\n$$\nThe mass flow rate is $\\dot{m}_{2\\rightarrow1} = A J_{2\\rightarrow1} = \\frac{A D_{t}}{b} (C_{1}(t) - C_{2}(t))$.\n\nSubstituting the mass flow rate back into the conservation equations yields a system of coupled first-order ordinary differential equations:\n$$\n\\frac{dC_{1}}{dt} = \\frac{A D_{t}}{V b} (C_{2}(t) - C_{1}(t)) = -\\frac{A D_{t}}{V b} (C_{1}(t) - C_{2}(t))\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dC_{2}}{dt} = \\frac{A D_{t}}{V b} (C_{1}(t) - C_{2}(t))\n$$\nLet's define a rate constant $\\lambda = \\frac{A D_{t}}{V b}$, which has units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The system becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dC_{1}}{dt} = -\\lambda (C_{1} - C_{2})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dC_{2}}{dt} = \\lambda (C_{1} - C_{2})\n$$\nTo solve this system, we introduce the concentration difference $\\Delta C(t) = C_{1}(t) - C_{2}(t)$. Subtracting the second equation from the first gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(C_{1} - C_{2}) = -\\lambda (C_{1} - C_{2}) - \\lambda (C_{1} - C_{2}) \\implies \\frac{d(\\Delta C)}{dt} = -2\\lambda (\\Delta C)\n$$\nThis is a standard first-order linear ODE with the solution:\n$$\n\\Delta C(t) = \\Delta C(0) \\exp(-2\\lambda t) = (C_{1,0} - C_{2,0}) \\exp(-2\\lambda t)\n$$\nwhere $C_{1,0}$ and $C_{2,0}$ are the initial concentrations.\n\nAdditionally, adding the two governing equations shows that $\\frac{d}{dt}(C_{1} + C_{2}) = 0$, which means the total concentration is conserved: $C_{1}(t) + C_{2}(t) = C_{1,0} + C_{2,0}$. We now have a system of two algebraic equations:\n1. $C_{1}(t) - C_{2}(t) = (C_{1,0} - C_{2,0}) \\exp(-2\\lambda t)$\n2. $C_{1}(t) + C_{2}(t) = C_{1,0} + C_{2,0}$\n\nSolving for $C_{1}(t)$ and $C_{2}(t)$ by adding and subtracting these equations gives the analytical solution for the transient evolution:\n$$\nC_{1}(t) = \\frac{C_{1,0} + C_{2,0}}{2} + \\frac{C_{1,0} - C_{2,0}}{2} \\exp(-2\\lambda t)\n$$\n$$\nC_{2}(t) = \\frac{C_{1,0} + C_{2,0}}{2} - \\frac{C_{1,0} - C_{2,0}}{2} \\exp(-2\\lambda t)\n$$\nAs $t\\rightarrow\\infty$, the exponential term vanishes, and the system reaches an equilibrium concentration $C_{eq} = \\frac{C_{1,0} + C_{2,0}}{2}$.\n\nThe second task is to find the time $t_{\\varepsilon}$ at which the concentration everywhere in the system is within a relative tolerance $\\varepsilon$ of the final equilibrium concentration. This condition is formally stated as:\n$$\n\\max_{\\text{domain}} |C(t_{\\varepsilon}) - C_{eq}| \\le \\varepsilon C_{eq}\n$$\nWe evaluate the deviation from equilibrium $|C(t) - C_{eq}|$ in all parts of the system:\n- In subchannel $1$: $|C_{1}(t) - C_{eq}| = \\left|\\frac{C_{1,0} - C_{2,0}}{2} \\exp(-2\\lambda t)\\right|$\n- In subchannel $2$: $|C_{2}(t) - C_{eq}| = \\left|-\\frac{C_{1,0} - C_{2,0}}{2} \\exp(-2\\lambda t)\\right| = \\left|\\frac{C_{1,0} - C_{2,0}}{2} \\exp(-2\\lambda t)\\right|$\n- In the gap ($0 \\le x \\le b$):\n$$c(x,t) - C_{eq} = \\left( C_{1}(t) + \\frac{C_{2}(t) - C_{1}(t)}{b} x \\right) - C_{eq} = (C_1(t) - C_{eq}) + \\frac{C_2(t) - C_1(t)}{b} x$$\n$$c(x,t) - C_{eq} = \\frac{\\Delta C(t)}{2} - \\frac{\\Delta C(t)}{b} x = \\Delta C(t) \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{x}{b}\\right)$$\nThe deviation in the gap is $|c(x,t) - C_{eq}| = |\\Delta C(t)| \\left|\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{x}{b}\\right|$.\nThe term $|\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{x}{b}|$ on the interval $x \\in [0,b]$ has a maximum value of $\\frac{1}{2}$ at the endpoints $x=0$ and $x=b$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum deviation anywhere in the system at a given time $t$ is at the subchannel boundaries:\n$$\n\\max_{\\text{domain}} |C(t) - C_{eq}| = \\left|\\frac{C_{1,0} - C_{2,0}}{2} \\exp(-2\\lambda t)\\right|\n$$\nWe set this maximum deviation equal to the tolerance criterion at time $t_{\\varepsilon}$:\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{C_{1,0} - C_{2,0}}{2} \\exp(-2\\lambda t_{\\varepsilon})\\right| = \\varepsilon C_{eq}\n$$\nSubstituting $C_{eq} = \\frac{C_{1,0} + C_{2,0}}{2}$ and solving for $t_{\\varepsilon}$:\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{C_{1,0} - C_{2,0}}{2}\\right| \\exp(-2\\lambda t_{\\varepsilon}) = \\varepsilon \\frac{C_{1,0} + C_{2,0}}{2}\n$$\nAssuming $C_{1,0} \\ge C_{2,0}$ and $C_{1,0}+C_{2,0} > 0$ as per the given values, we can drop the absolute values.\n$$\n\\exp(-2\\lambda t_{\\varepsilon}) = \\frac{\\varepsilon (C_{1,0} + C_{2,0})}{C_{1,0} - C_{2,0}}\n$$\n$$\n-2\\lambda t_{\\varepsilon} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon (C_{1,0} + C_{2,0})}{C_{1,0} - C_{2,0}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nt_{\\varepsilon} = -\\frac{1}{2\\lambda} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon (C_{1,0} + C_{2,0})}{C_{1,0} - C_{2,0}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2\\lambda} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{1,0} - C_{2,0}}{\\varepsilon (C_{1,0} + C_{2,0})}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting $\\lambda = \\frac{A D_{t}}{V b}$:\n$$\nt_{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{V b}{2 A D_{t}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{1,0} - C_{2,0}}{\\varepsilon (C_{1,0} + C_{2,0})}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we insert the provided numerical data:\n$V = 2.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m^{3}}$\n$b = 2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n$A = 1.5 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}}$\n$D_{t} = 8.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}}$\n$C_{1,0} = 1.2\\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$\n$C_{2,0} = 0.0\\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$\n$\\varepsilon = 0.01$\n\nFirst, calculate the time constant factor:\n$$\n\\frac{V b}{2 A D_{t}} = \\frac{(2.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m^{3}}) (2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m})}{2 (1.5 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}}) (8.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}})} = \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m^{4}}}{2.4 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m^{4}\\,s^{-1}}} = \\frac{1}{6}\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nNext, calculate the argument of the natural logarithm:\n$$\n\\frac{C_{1,0} - C_{2,0}}{\\varepsilon (C_{1,0} + C_{2,0})} = \\frac{1.2 - 0.0}{0.01 (1.2 + 0.0)} = \\frac{1.2}{0.01 \\times 1.2} = \\frac{1}{0.01} = 100\n$$\nFinally, calculate $t_{\\varepsilon}$:\n$$\nt_{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{1}{6} \\ln(100) \\ \\mathrm{s} \\approx 0.767528... \\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $t_{\\varepsilon} = 0.7675\\ \\mathrm{s}$.",

            "problem": "You are to model lateral turbulent mixing and crossflow exchange between subchannels in a nuclear reactor subchannel network and compute characteristic equilibration time scales for a step change in heat generation in one subchannel. Begin from the conservation of a passive scalar (here, temperature) in a control volume and fundamental transport laws. Specifically, use the scalar conservation in each subchannel control volume, Fickian turbulent diffusion across shared interfaces, and a linear phenomenological crossflow exchange between adjacent subchannels. Do not assume any pre-derived shortcut formulas; construct the governing linear system and characterize its dynamics.\n \nBase assumptions and definitions:\n- The passive scalar varies only laterally across subchannels and is uniform within any single subchannel control volume.\n- Turbulent diffusion follows a Fickian law at each interface, with flux proportional to concentration difference and turbulent diffusivity.\n- Crossflow exchange follows a linear phenomenological law, with flux proportional to concentration difference and a crossflow exchange coefficient.\n- The coolant fluid properties are constant.\n- A step change in heat generation rate is applied in one specified subchannel at $t = 0$, producing a constant volumetric heat source thereafter. All other subchannels have zero volumetric heat source.\n- The axial direction is not explicitly modeled; you will focus on the lateral distribution dynamics. You may treat axial advection and heat removal implicitly via the system’s structure if needed, but your primary aim is to characterize lateral equilibration.\n\nFundamental starting point:\n- Scalar conservation in subchannel $i$: the rate of change of the scalar integrated over volume equals the net inflow due to turbulent diffusion and crossflow across interfaces plus internal volumetric generation. For temperature $T_i(t)$, density $\\rho$, specific heat $c_p$, and volume $V_i$, the control-volume balance is\n$$\n\\rho c_p V_i \\frac{d T_i}{dt} = \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}(i)} \\left( \\Phi^{\\text{turb}}_{ij} + \\Phi^{\\text{cf}}_{ij} \\right) + q'_i V_i,\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{N}(i)$ is the set of subchannels adjacent to $i$, $q'_i$ is the volumetric heat generation rate in $\\text{W}/\\text{m}^3$, $\\Phi^{\\text{turb}}_{ij}$ is the turbulent diffusion exchange across interface $i$-$j$, and $\\Phi^{\\text{cf}}_{ij}$ is the crossflow exchange across interface $i$-$j$.\n- Turbulent diffusion exchange across an interface $i$-$j$ of area $A_{ij}$ and mixing length $L_{ij}$ with turbulent diffusivity $D_t$ obeys\n$$\n\\Phi^{\\text{turb}}_{ij} = \\rho c_p \\, D_t \\, \\frac{A_{ij}}{L_{ij}} \\left( T_j - T_i \\right).\n$$\n- Crossflow exchange across interface $i$-$j$ with crossflow coefficient $K_{cf}$ obeys\n$$\n\\Phi^{\\text{cf}}_{ij} = \\rho c_p \\, V_i \\, K_{cf} \\left( T_j - T_i \\right).\n$$\n\nYour program must construct the linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) system implied by these relations for the specified subchannel configurations, identify the lateral mixing operator, and derive the nonzero eigenvalues that determine the characteristic time scales of equilibration. For a step input applied to one subchannel, the approach to the steady lateral distribution is governed by these eigenvalues; for the special case of two identical subchannels, one can reduce the dynamics to a first-order linear ODE in the subchannel temperature difference.

While density $\\rho$ and specific heat $c_p$ are given, they are not required for calculating the time constants, which depend only on the system's geometry and mixing coefficients. This does not represent a contradiction but rather the inclusion of information that would be necessary for calculating absolute temperatures, which is not requested.\n- **Wording clarification:** The definition of $t_{0.95}$ for the three-subchannel case contains a minor terminological error: \"use the reciprocal of the smallest nonzero eigenvalue as the characteristic decay rate\". The reciprocal of an eigenvalue is a time constant, not a rate. The physically correct interpretation, which will be adopted, is that the smallest nonzero eigenvalue's *magnitude* is the characteristic decay rate. This ambiguity is minor and does not invalidate the problem, as the physical intent is clear.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A reasoned solution will be developed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis begins by formalizing the governing equations into a matrix system. Substituting the flux expressions into the conservation equation for subchannel $i$:\n$$ \\rho c_p V_i \\frac{d T_i}{dt} = \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}(i)} \\left( \\rho c_p \\, D_t \\, \\frac{A_{ij}}{L_{ij}} + \\rho c_p \\, V_i \\, K_{cf} \\right) \\left( T_j - T_i \\right) + q'_i V_i $$\nDividing by $\\rho c_p V_i$ isolates the time derivative of temperature:\n$$ \\frac{d T_i}{dt} = \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}(i)} \\left( \\frac{D_t A_{ij}}{V_i L_{ij}} + K_{cf} \\right) (T_j - T_i) + \\frac{q'_i}{\\rho c_p} $$\nLet us define a coupling coefficient $C_{ij}$ representing the rate of exchange from subchannel $j$ to subchannel $i$. Since all interacting subchannels in the test cases have equal volumes ($V_i=V_j=V$), the coefficient is symmetric, $C_{ij} = C_{ji} = C$:\n$$ C_{ij} = \\frac{D_t A_{ij}}{V_i L_{ij}} + K_{cf} $$\nThe system of equations can be written in matrix form:\n$$ \\frac{d\\mathbf{T}}{dt} = \\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{T} + \\mathbf{S} $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{T}(t) = [T_1(t), T_2(t), \\dots, T_N(t)]^T$ is the vector of subchannel temperatures, $\\mathbf{S}$ is the vector of source terms $S_i = q'_i / (\\rho c_p)$, and $\\mathbf{M}$ is the lateral mixing operator matrix. The elements of $\\mathbf{M}$ are:\n-   $M_{ij} = C_{ij}$ for $i \\neq j$ and $j \\in \\mathcal{N}(i)$.\n-   $M_{ij} = 0$ for $i \\neq j$ and $j \\notin \\mathcal{N}(i)$.\n-   $M_{ii} = - \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}(i)} C_{ij}$.\n\nThe matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ is a form of a graph Laplacian. Its eigenvalues, $\\lambda_k$, are all real and non-positive. One eigenvalue is always $\\lambda_1 = 0$, corresponding to the uniform heating of the entire system. The non-zero eigenvalues govern the equilibration of temperature differences between subchannels. The characteristic time constant for each mode of equilibration is $\\tau_k = -1/\\lambda_k$. The dominant (slowest) time constant, $\\tau_{\\text{dom}}$, corresponds to the non-zero eigenvalue with the smallest magnitude:\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{dom}} = \\frac{1}{\\min_{k | \\lambda_k \\neq 0} |\\lambda_k|} = \\frac{-1}{\\max_{k | \\lambda_k \\neq 0} \\lambda_k} $$\n\nFor a first-order system with time constant $\\tau$, the response to a step input follows the form $(1 - e^{-t/\\tau})$. The time $t_{0.95}$ to reach $0.95$ of the final value is found by solving $0.95 = 1 - e^{-t_{0.95}/\\tau}$, which yields:\n$$ t_{0.95} = -\\tau \\ln(0.05) $$\nFor the two-subchannel cases, the dynamics of the temperature difference $\\Delta T = T_1 - T_2$ reduce exactly to a first-order ODE, and this formula is exact. For the three-subchannel case, the problem specifies using the dominant time constant $\\tau_{\\text{dom}}$ to compute $t_{0.95}$, which is a standard approximation assuming the system's long-term behavior is dictated by its slowest mode.\n\n### Case-by-Case Analysis\n\n**Case 1: Two identical subchannels**\n\n-   Parameters: $V_1=V_2=0.001$, $A_{12}=0.002$, $L_{12}=0.01$, $D_t=1\\times 10^{-4}$, $K_{cf}=0.2$.\n-   The coupling coefficient is:\n    $$ C = \\frac{(1 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{m}^2/\\text{s})(0.002 \\, \\text{m}^2)}{(0.001 \\, \\text{m}^3)(0.01 \\, \\text{m})} + 0.2 \\, \\text{s}^{-1} = 0.02 \\, \\text{s}^{-1} + 0.2 \\, \\text{s}^{-1} = 0.22 \\, \\text{s}^{-1} $$\n-   The mixing matrix is $\\mathbf{M} = \\begin{pmatrix} -C & C \\\\ C & -C \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -0.22 & 0.22 \\\\ 0.22 & -0.22 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n-   The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 0$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2C = -0.44 \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$.\n-   The smallest non-zero eigenvalue magnitude is $|-0.44| = 0.44 \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$.\n-   $\\tau_{\\text{dom}} = 1/0.44 \\, \\text{s} = 25/11 \\, \\text{s} \\approx 2.2727 \\, \\text{s}$.\n-   $t_{0.95} = -\\tau_{\\text{dom}} \\ln(0.05) = (25/11) \\times 2.99573... \\, \\text{s} \\approx 6.8085 \\, \\text{s}$.\n\n**Case 2: Two subchannels, no crossflow**\n\n-   Parameters: $V_1=V_2=0.001$, $A_{12}=0.002$, $L_{12}=0.01$, $D_t=3\\times 10^{-4}$, $K_{cf}=0$.\n-   The coupling coefficient is:\n    $$ C = \\frac{(3 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{m}^2/\\text{s})(0.002 \\, \\text{m}^2)}{(0.001 \\, \\text{m}^3)(0.01 \\, \\text{m})} + 0 \\, \\text{s}^{-1} = 0.06 \\, \\text{s}^{-1} $$\n-   Eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 0$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2C = -0.12 \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$.\n-   The smallest non-zero eigenvalue magnitude is $|-0.12| = 0.12 \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$.\n-   $\\tau_{\\text{dom}} = 1/0.12 \\, \\text{s} = 25/3 \\, \\text{s} \\approx 8.3333 \\, \\text{s}$.\n-   $t_{0.95} = -\\tau_{\\text{dom}} \\ln(0.05) = (25/3) \\times 2.99573... \\, \\text{s} \\approx 24.9644 \\, \\text{s}$.\n\n**Case 3: Two subchannels, no turbulence**\n\n-   Parameters: $V_1=V_2=0.001$, $A_{12}=0.002$, $L_{12}=0.01$, $D_t=0$, $K_{cf}=0.05$.\n-   The coupling coefficient is:\n    $$ C = 0 \\, \\text{s}^{-1} + 0.05 \\, \\text{s}^{-1} = 0.05 \\, \\text{s}^{-1} $$\n-   Eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 0$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2C = -0.10 \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$.\n-   The smallest non-zero eigenvalue magnitude is $|-0.10| = 0.10 \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$.\n-   $\\tau_{\\text{dom}} = 1/0.10 \\, \\text{s} = 10 \\, \\text{s}$.\n-   $t_{0.95} = -10 \\ln(0.05) \\, \\text{s} = 10 \\times 2.99573... \\, \\text{s} \\approx 29.9573 \\, \\text{s}$.\n\n**Case 4: Three subchannels in a line**\n\n-   Parameters: $V_1=V_2=V_3=0.001$, $A_{12}=A_{23}=0.002$, $L_{12}=L_{23}=0.01$, $D_t=2\\times 10^{-4}$, $K_{cf}=0.1$.\n-   The coupling coefficients $C_{12}$ and $C_{23}$ are identical, let's call them $C$:\n    $$ C = \\frac{(2 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{m}^2/\\text{s})(0.002 \\, \\text{m}^2)}{(0.001 \\, \\text{m}^3)(0.01 \\, \\text{m})} + 0.1 \\, \\text{s}^{-1} = 0.04 \\, \\text{s}^{-1} + 0.1 \\, \\text{s}^{-1} = 0.14 \\, \\text{s}^{-1} $$\n-   The mixing matrix is:\n    $$ \\mathbf{M} = \\begin{pmatrix} -C & C & 0 \\\\ C & -2C & C \\\\ 0 & C & -C \\end{pmatrix} = 0.14 \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & -2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n-   The eigenvalues of the integer matrix are known to be $0, -1, -3$.

Assume a constant crossflow speed $u_{c}>0$ directed from subchannel $1$ to subchannel $2$, uniform lateral grid spacing $\\Delta y$, and a smooth $h(y)$ that admits a Taylor expansion. The canonical two-subchannel test is represented locally by a uniform one-dimensional grid in the lateral coordinate $y$, with nodal values $h_{i}$ located at $y_{i}$ and spacing $\\Delta y=y_{i}-y_{i-1}$.

Truncation Error Analysis**\n\nThe truncation error, $\\tau$, is defined as the result of applying the discrete operator to the exact solution minus the exact differential operator.\n\n**Upwind Differencing Scheme:**\nThe discrete operator for the upwind scheme (with $u_c > 0$) is $L_{\\Delta y}^{\\text{upwind}}(h) = u_c \\frac{h_i - h_{i-1}}{\\Delta y}$.\nTo find what this discrete operator represents, we substitute the Taylor series expansion for $h_{i-1}$:\n$$L_{\\Delta y}^{\\text{upwind}}(h) = \\frac{u_c}{\\Delta y} \\left[ h_i - \\left( h_i - \\Delta y \\left.\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y}\\right|_i + \\frac{(\\Delta y)^2}{2} \\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial y^2}\\right|_i - O((\\Delta y)^3) \\right) \\right]$$\n$$L_{\\Delta y}^{\\text{upwind}}(h) = \\frac{u_c}{\\Delta y} \\left[ \\Delta y \\left.\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y}\\right|_i - \\frac{(\\Delta y)^2}{2} \\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial y^2}\\right|_i + O((\\Delta y)^3) \\right]$$\n$$L_{\\Delta y}^{\\text{upwind}}(h) = u_c \\left.\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y}\\right|_i - \\frac{u_c \\Delta y}{2} \\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial y^2}\\right|_i + O((\\Delta y)^2)$$\nThe truncation error is:\n$$\\tau_{\\text{upwind}} = L_{\\Delta y}^{\\text{upwind}}(h) - L(h) = \\left( u_c \\left.\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y}\\right|_i - \\frac{u_c \\Delta y}{2} \\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial y^2}\\right|_i + \\dots \\right) - u_c \\left.\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y}\\right|_i$$\n$$\\tau_{\\text{upwind}} = - \\frac{u_c \\Delta y}{2} \\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial y^2}\\right|_i + O((\\Delta y)^2)$$\nThe leading-order truncation error for the upwind scheme is proportional to $\\Delta y$, making the scheme first-order accurate. The derivative that appears is the second derivative, $\\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial y^2}$. An even-order derivative term corresponds to dissipation or diffusion. Therefore, the leading-order error of the first-order upwind scheme is diffusive in character. This is often termed \"numerical diffusion\" or \"artificial viscosity\".\n\n**Central Differencing Scheme:**\nThe discrete operator for the central scheme is $L_{\\Delta y}^{\\text{central}}(h) = u_c \\frac{h_{i+1} - h_{i-1}}{2 \\Delta y}$.\nWe substitute the Taylor series expansions for $h_{i+1}$ and $h_{i-1}$:\n$$L_{\\Delta y}^{\\text{central}}(h) = \\frac{u_c}{2 \\Delta y} \\left[ \\left( h_i + \\Delta y \\left.\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y}\\right|_i + \\frac{(\\Delta y)^2}{2} \\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial y^2}\\right|_i + \\frac{(\\Delta y)^3}{6} \\left.\\frac{\\partial^3 h}{\\partial y^3}\\right|_i + \\dots \\right) - \\left( h_i - \\Delta y \\left.\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y}\\right|_i + \\frac{(\\Delta y)^2}{2} \\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial y^2}\\right|_i - \\frac{(\\Delta y)^3}{6} \\left.\\frac{\\partial^3 h}{\\partial y^3}\\right|_i + \\dots \\right) \\right]$$\n$$L_{\\Delta y}^{\\text{central}}(h) = \\frac{u_c}{2 \\Delta y} \\left[ 2 \\Delta y \\left.\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y}\\right|_i + 2 \\frac{(\\Delta y)^3}{6} \\left.\\frac{\\partial^3 h}{\\partial y^3}\\right|_i + O((\\Delta y)^5) \\right]$$\n$$L_{\\Delta y}^{\\text{central}}(h) = u_c \\left.\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y}\\right|_i + \\frac{u_c (\\Delta y)^2}{6} \\left.\\frac{\\partial^3 h}{\\partial y^3}\\right|_i + O((\\Delta y)^4)$$\nThe truncation error is:\n$$\\tau_{\\text{central}} = L_{\\Delta y}^{\\text{central}}(h) - L(h) = \\left( u_c \\left.\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y}\\right|_i + \\frac{u_c (\\Delta y)^2}{6} \\left.\\frac{\\partial^3 h}{\\partial y^3}\\right|_i + \\dots \\right) - u_c \\left.\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y}\\right|_i$$\n$$\\tau_{\\text{central}} = \\frac{u_c (\\Delta y)^2}{6} \\left.\\frac{\\partial^3 h}{\\partial y^3}\\right|_i + O((\\Delta y)^4)$$\nThe leading-order truncation error for the central scheme is proportional to $(\\Delta y)^2$, making the scheme second-order accurate. The derivative that appears is the third derivative, $\\frac{\\partial^3 h}{\\partial y^3}$. An odd-order derivative term corresponds to dispersion, which can introduce non-physical oscillations into the numerical solution.\n\n**2. Equivalent Fickian Diffusion Coefficient**\n\nThe modified equation is the partial differential equation that is more accurately solved by the finite difference scheme than the original PDE. For a pure advection equation, using the upwind scheme introduces error terms, with the leading term being a diffusion-like term. The discretized equation implicitly solves a version of the advection-diffusion equation.\n\nConsider the advection equation $\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t} + u_c \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y} = 0$.\nDiscretizing the spatial derivative with the upwind scheme yields $\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t} + u_c \\frac{h_i - h_{i-1}}{\\Delta y} = 0$.\nWe replace the discrete term with its continuous representation from the Taylor analysis:\n$$\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t} + \\left( u_c \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y} - \\frac{u_c \\Delta y}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial y^2} + O((\\Delta y)^2) \\right) = 0$$\nRearranging this gives the modified equation:\n$$\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t} + u_c \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y} = \\frac{u_c \\Delta y}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial y^2} - O((\\Delta y)^2)$$\nThis equation has the form of an advection-diffusion equation, where the term on the right-hand side represents the diffusion process. The physical turbulent mixing is modeled by a Fickian diffusion term $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(D_{t}\\,\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y}\\right)$. The numerical discretization introduces an artificial effect of the form $D_{\\text{num}} \\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial y^2}$ (assuming constant $D_{\\text{num}}$), which adds to any physical diffusion.\n\nThe problem asks for the coefficient $D_{\\text{num}}$ of an equivalent Fickian diffusion term $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(D_{\\text{num}}\\,\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y}\\right) = D_{\\text{num}}\\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial y^2}$ that reproduces this leading-order effect. By comparing the leading-order error term in the modified equation with the form $D_{\\text{num}}\\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial y^2}$, we can directly identify the numerical diffusion coefficient.\n$$D_{\\text{num}}\\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{u_c \\Delta y}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial y^2}$$\nThus, the equivalent numerical diffusion coefficient is:\n$$D_{\\text{num}} = \\frac{u_c \\Delta y}{2}$$\n\n**Numerical Calculation:**\nWe are given the values for the canonical two-subchannel test: $u_c = 0.12\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$ and $\\Delta y = 0.0135\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $D_{\\text{num}}$:\n$$D_{\\text{num}} = \\frac{(0.12\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}) \\times (0.0135\\,\\mathrm{m})}{2}$$\n$$D_{\\text{num}} = \\frac{0.00162}{2}\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}$$\n$$D_{\\text{num}} = 0.00081\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$D_{\\text{num}} = 0.0008100\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}$$\nIn scientific notation, this is $8.100 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}$.",
