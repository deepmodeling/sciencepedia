To reconstruct pin-averaged powers, a form-function method is used in which a dimensionless pin-averaged form function $F_{p}^{\\text{avg}}$ is taken from a high-fidelity transport library such as the Method of Characteristics (MOC). The reconstructed pin-averaged power in pin $p$ is modeled by $P_{p}^{\\text{rec}} = q_{\\text{node}} F_{p}^{\\text{avg}} V_{p}$, where $V_{p}$ is the physical volume of pin $p$ within the node.

It is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be constructed.\n\nThe fundamental principle underlying pin power reconstruction is the conservation of power. The sum of the reconstructed powers for all pins within a node must equal the total power of that node. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\n\\sum_{p} P_{p}^{\\text{rec}} = P_{\\text{node}}\n$$\nwhere the summation is over all pins $p$ in the node.\n\nThe problem provides definitions for the reconstructed pin power, $P_{p}^{\\text{rec}}$, and the total node power, $P_{\\text{node}}$:\n$$\nP_{p}^{\\text{rec}} = q_{\\text{node}} F_{p}^{\\text{avg}} V_{p}\n$$\n$$\nP_{\\text{node}} = q_{\\text{node}} V_{\\text{node}}\n$$\nHere, $q_{\\text{node}}$ is the node-averaged volumetric power density, $F_{p}^{\\text{avg}}$ is the dimensionless pin-averaged form function for pin $p$, $V_{p}$ is the volume of pin $p$, and $V_{\\text{node}}$ is the total volume of the node, defined as $V_{\\text{node}} = \\sum_{p} V_{p}$.\n\nSubstituting these definitions into the power conservation equation yields:\n$$\n\\sum_{p} (q_{\\text{node}} F_{p}^{\\text{avg}} V_{p}) = q_{\\text{node}} V_{\\text{node}}\n$$\nThe node-averaged power density $q_{\\text{node}}$ is a constant factor for all terms in the summation and on the right-hand side. Assuming a non-trivial case where power is generated ($q_{\\text{node}} \\neq 0$), we can divide both sides by $q_{\\text{node}}$:\n$$\n\\sum_{p} F_{p}^{\\text{avg}} V_{p} = V_{\\text{node}}\n$$\nThis equation is the normalization condition that the set of form functions $\\{F_{p}^{\\text{avg}}\\}$ must satisfy.

Use $P_z$ to calculate the maximum hot-pin linear heat rate, $L_{\\max}$.\n\n    **Step 2.1: Finding the Axial Peaking Factor $P_z$**\n    The axial peaking factor is defined as $P_{z} = \\max_{z \\in [0,H]} F^{z}(z)$. To find the maximum value of the function $F^z(z)$, we must find its critical points by taking the derivative with respect to $z$ and setting it to zero. The maximum will then be the largest value of the function evaluated at these critical points and at the boundaries of the interval, $z=0$ and $z=H$.\n\n    The function is:\n    $$ F^{z}(z) = 1 + \\alpha \\cos\\Big(\\frac{\\pi z}{H}\\Big) + \\beta \\cos\\Big(\\frac{2\\pi z}{H}\\Big) $$\n    Its derivative with respect to $z$ is:\n    $$ \\frac{dF^z}{dz} = -\\alpha \\frac{\\pi}{H}\\sin\\Big(\\frac{\\pi z}{H}\\Big) - \\beta \\frac{2\\pi}{H}\\sin\\Big(\\frac{2\\pi z}{H}\\Big) $$\n    Using the double-angle identity $\\sin(2\\theta) = 2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)$, we can rewrite the derivative as:\n    $$ \\frac{dF^z}{dz} = -\\alpha \\frac{\\pi}{H}\\sin\\Big(\\frac{\\pi z}{H}\\Big) - \\beta \\frac{2\\pi}{H} \\left( 2\\sin\\Big(\\frac{\\pi z}{H}\\Big)\\cos\\Big(\\frac{\\pi z}{H}\\Big) \\right) $$\n    $$ \\frac{dF^z}{dz} = -\\frac{\\pi}{H}\\sin\\Big(\\frac{\\pi z}{H}\\Big) \\left( \\alpha + 4\\beta \\cos\\Big(\\frac{\\pi z}{H}\\Big) \\right) $$\n    Setting the derivative to zero, $\\frac{dF^z}{dz} = 0$, gives two conditions for critical points within the interval:\n    1.  $\\sin(\\frac{\\pi z}{H}) = 0 \\implies \\frac{\\pi z}{H} = n\\pi$ for integer $n$. For $z \\in [0, H]$, this gives $z=0$ and $z=H$, which are the boundaries.\n    2.  $\\alpha + 4\\beta \\cos(\\frac{\\pi z}{H}) = 0 \\implies \\cos(\\frac{\\pi z}{H}) = -\\frac{\\alpha}{4\\beta}$.\n\n    Now, we substitute the given values $\\alpha = 0.25$ and $\\beta = 0.10$:\n    $$ \\cos\\Big(\\frac{\\pi z}{H}\\Big) = -\\frac{0.25}{4(0.10)} = -\\frac{0.25}{0.40} = -0.625 $$\n    Since $|-0.625| \\le 1$, there exists at least one value of $z \\in (0, H)$ that satisfies this condition. Let's call this location $z_{crit}$.\n\n    To find the maximum value of $F^z(z)$, we evaluate the function at the boundaries ($z=0$, $z=H$) and at any internal critical points (where $\\cos(\\frac{\\pi z}{H}) = -0.625$).\n\n    Evaluation at the boundary $z=0$:\n    $$ F^z(0) = 1 + \\alpha \\cos(0) + \\beta \\cos(0) = 1 + \\alpha + \\beta = 1 + 0.25 + 0.10 = 1.35 $$\n\n    Evaluation at the boundary $z=H$:\n    $$ F^z(H) = 1 + \\alpha \\cos(\\pi) + \\beta \\cos(2\\pi) = 1 - \\alpha + \\beta = 1 - 0.25 + 0.10 = 0.85 $$\n\n    Evaluation at the internal critical point $z_{crit}$:\n    To evaluate $F^z(z_{crit})$, we can use the identity $\\cos(2\\theta) = 2\\cos^2(\\theta) - 1$.\n    $$ F^z(z) = 1 + \\alpha \\cos\\Big(\\frac{\\pi z}{H}\\Big) + \\beta \\left( 2\\cos^2\\Big(\\frac{\\pi z}{H}\\Big) - 1 \\right) $$\n    At $z_{crit}$, we substitute $\\cos(\\frac{\\pi z_{crit}}{H}) = -\\frac{\\alpha}{4\\beta}$:\n    $$ F^z(z_{crit}) = 1 + \\alpha\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha}{4\\beta}\\right) + \\beta\\left( 2\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha}{4\\beta}\\right)^2 - 1 \\right) $$\n    $$ F^z(z_{crit}) = 1 - \\frac{\\alpha^2}{4\\beta} + \\beta\\left( \\frac{2\\alpha^2}{16\\beta^2} \\right) - \\beta = 1 - \\frac{\\alpha^2}{4\\beta} + \\frac{\\alpha^2}{8\\beta} - \\beta $$\n    $$ F^z(z_{crit}) = 1 - \\beta - \\frac{\\alpha^2}{8\\beta} $$\n    Substituting the numeric values:\n    $$ F^z(z_{crit}) = 1 - 0.10 - \\frac{(0.25)^2}{8(0.10)} = 0.90 - \\frac{0.0625}{0.80} = 0.90 - 0.078125 = 0.821875 $$\n    Comparing the values: $\\{1.35, 0.85, 0.821875\\}$. The maximum value is $1.35$.\n    Thus, the axial peaking factor is:\n    $$ P_z = 1.35 $$\n\n    **Step 2.2: Finding the Maximum Hot-Pin Linear Heat Rate $L_{\\max}$**\n    The maximum hot-pin linear heat rate is given by:\n    $$ L_{\\max} = \\max_{z \\in [0,H]} L_{\\text{pin}}(z) = \\max_{z \\in [0,H]} \\left( \\overline{L}\\,F^{p}(x_{\\ast},y_{\\ast})\\,F^{z}(z) \\right) $$\n    Since $\\overline{L}$ and $F^{p}(x_{\\ast},y_{\\ast})$ are positive constants, the maximum of the product occurs where $F^z(z)$ is maximum.\n    $$ L_{\\max} = \\overline{L}\\,F^{p}(x_{\\ast},y_{\\ast})\\, \\left( \\max_{z \\in [0,H]} F^{z}(z) \\right) = \\overline{L}\\,F^{p}(x_{\\ast},y_{\\ast})\\, P_z $$\n    Substituting the given values and the calculated value for $P_z$:\n    $$ \\overline{L} = 17.0~\\text{kW/m} $$\n    $$ F^{p}(x_{\\ast},y_{\\ast}) = 1.58 $$\n    $$ P_z = 1.35 $$\n    $$ L_{\\max} = (17.0) \\times (1.58) \\times (1.35) $$\n    $$ L_{\\max} = 26.86 \\times 1.35 = 36.261~\\text{kW/m} $$\n    The problem asks for the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n    $$ L_{\\max} \\approx 36.26~\\text{kW/m} $$\n\nThe detailed calculation steps have been completed and verified. The logic is sound and follows from the problem statement. The final step is to present the numerical answer in the required format.",
