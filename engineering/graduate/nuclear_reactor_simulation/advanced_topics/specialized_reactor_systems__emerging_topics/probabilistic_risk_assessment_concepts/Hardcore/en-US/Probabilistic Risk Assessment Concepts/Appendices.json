            "problem": "A reactor has just undergone a shutdown, and the Decay Heat Removal system is required to operate over a mission time of $24$ hours to remove residual heat. In a Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) context for nuclear reactor simulation, consider the top event defined as the failure of the Decay Heat Removal function during the mission time. The fault tree for the top event has the following minimal cut sets (each a conjunction of independent basic component failures):\n- $M_{1} = \\{A, B\\}$,\n- $M_{2} = \\{B, C\\}$,\n- $M_{3} = \\{C, D\\}$,\n- $M_{4} = \\{A, D\\}$.\n\nAssume the basic events are statistically independent with the following mission-time failure probabilities:\n- $P(A) = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3}$,\n- $P(B) = 8.0 \\times 10^{-4}$,\n- $P(C) = 1.2 \\times 10^{-3}$,\n- $P(D) = 9.0 \\times 10^{-4}$.\n\nUsing only fundamental probability axioms and the inclusion-exclusion principle developed from first principles, compute the exact probability of the top event as the union of the minimal cut set failure events.

The approximation is an overestimate, which is expected. The sum $\\sum P(E_i)$ double-counts the probability of the intersections of the events $E_i$. The inclusion-exclusion principle corrects for this by subtracting the probabilities of pairwise intersections, adding back the triple intersections, and so on. For rare events, the probabilities of intersections are much smaller than the probabilities of single events, so the first term dominates, and truncating the series after the first term (the rare-event approximation) provides a good estimate. This estimate is conservative as it overstates the probability of failure.

This analysis is fundamental to modeling safety system unavailability and optimizing testing strategies in nuclear facilities.",
            "id": "4242399",
            "problem": "A nuclear reactor protection system includes a single standby safety component (for example, a safety injection pump) that is not operating during normal conditions but must start on demand. The component is subject to dangerous failures in the dormant state that occur according to a Poisson process with constant rate $\\lambda$ (so the time to failure from an as-good-as-new state is exponentially distributed with rate $\\lambda$). The component is proof-tested periodically every $\\tau$ units of time to reveal any dangerous failure. If a dangerous failure is present at a proof test, repair begins immediately and returns the component to an as-good-as-new state, with repair time modeled as exponentially distributed with rate $\\mu$ and independent of the failure process. Assume that the proof test itself is instantaneous and that each renewal cycle begins at the moment the component is restored to an as-good-as-new state (i.e., immediately after the completion of any repair). Subsequent proof test scheduling is measured from that restoration time. Demands on the component occur at times that are uniformly distributed over the long run, so the Probability of Failure on Demand (PFD) can be identified with the long-run time-average unavailability.\n\nStarting only from the fundamental definitions of the exponential time-to-failure model, the renewal process concept, and the Renewal Reward Theorem (which states that the long-run average reward equals the expected reward per cycle divided by the expected cycle length), derive:\n\n$1.$ The instantaneous PFD at time $t$ since the beginning of a renewal cycle, for $0 \\leq t \\leq \\tau$.\n\n$2.$ The long-run average PFD over the renewal cycle, defined as the fraction of time the component is failed in the long run, expressed in closed form in terms of $\\lambda$, $\\mu$, and $\\tau$.\n\nExpress your final answer as a single closed-form analytic expression for the average PFD over the renewal cycle. No numerical evaluation is required. If you introduce any acronyms, define them on first use. The final expression must be dimensionless.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for two quantities: the instantaneous Probability of Failure on Demand (PFD) at a time $t$ within a test interval, and the long-run average PFD. We shall derive them in sequence.\n\nFirst, let us define the Probability of Failure on Demand (PFD). In this context, it is synonymous with the unavailability of the component, which is the probability that the component is in a failed state at any given time.\n\n**1. Instantaneous PFD at time $t$**\n\nThe problem asks for the instantaneous PFD at time $t$ since the beginning of a renewal cycle, for $0 \\leq t \\leq \\tau$. A renewal cycle begins with the component in an as-good-as-new state. The time to failure, which we denote by the random variable $T_f$, is given to be exponentially distributed with a constant rate $\\lambda$. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) for $T_f$ is given by:\n$$F_{T_f}(t) = P(T_f \\leq t) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t)$$\nfor $t \\geq 0$.\n\nFor any time $t$ within the first proof test interval, i.e., $0 \\leq t \\leq \\tau$, a failure that has occurred at a time $t' \\leq t$ would not yet have been detected, as the first test only occurs at time $\\tau$. Therefore, the component, if failed, remains in its failed state. The instantaneous PFD at time $t$, which we denote as $q(t)$, is the probability that the component has failed by time $t$.\n$$q(t) = P(T_f \\leq t) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t), \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\leq t \\leq \\tau$$\nThis completes the first part of the derivation.\n\n**2. Long-run Average PFD**\n\nTo find the long-run average PFD, denoted $\\bar{q}$, we will use the Renewal Reward Theorem as stipulated. This theorem states that the long-run average reward per unit time is equal to the ratio of the expected reward per renewal cycle to the expected length of a renewal cycle. In our case, the \"reward\" is the time the component is unavailable (or down). Thus, the average PFD is the ratio of the expected downtime per cycle to the expected cycle length:\n$$\\bar{q} = \\frac{E[T_{\\text{down}}]}{E[T_C]}$$\nwhere $T_C$ is the duration of a renewal cycle and $T_{\\text{down}}$ is the total time the component is down within that cycle.\n\nThe problem defines a renewal cycle as the time between two consecutive restorations to the as-good-as-new state. This restoration occurs immediately after a repair is completed.\n\n**Expected Cycle Length, $E[T_C]$**\n\nLet a cycle begin at time $t=0$ with the component being as-good-as-new.\nThe component will fail at some random time $T_f \\sim \\text{Exp}(\\lambda)$.\nThe failure is detected at the next scheduled proof test, which occurs at times $\\tau, 2\\tau, 3\\tau, \\dots$. The detection time, $T_{\\text{det}}$, is therefore given by $T_{\\text{det}} = \\lceil T_f / \\tau \\rceil \\tau$.\nTo find the expectation $E[T_{\\text{det}}]$, let us first find the expectation of the discrete random variable $K = \\lceil T_f / \\tau \\rceil$. $K$ is the index of the test interval during which the failure is detected. The probability of $K$ taking a specific value $k$ ($k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$) is:\n$$P(K=k) = P((k-1)\\tau  T_f \\leq k\\tau)$$\nUsing the survival function of the exponential distribution, $P(T_f > t) = \\exp(-\\lambda t)$, we have:\n$$P(K=k) = P(T_f > (k-1)\\tau) - P(T_f > k\\tau) = \\exp(-\\lambda(k-1)\\tau) - \\exp(-\\lambda k\\tau)$$\n$$P(K=k) = \\exp(-\\lambda(k-1)\\tau) \\left(1 - \\exp(-\\lambda\\tau)\\right)$$\nThis is the probability mass function of a geometric distribution with \"success\" probability $p = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda\\tau)$. The expected value of such a random variable is $E[K] = 1/p$.\n$$E[K] = \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-\\lambda\\tau)}$$\nThe expected detection time is $E[T_{\\text{det}}] = E[K\\tau] = \\tau E[K]$, so:\n$$E[T_{\\text{det}}] = \\frac{\\tau}{1 - \\exp(-\\lambda\\tau)}$$\nUpon detection at $T_{\\text{det}}$, a repair begins, which takes a time $T_r \\sim \\text{Exp}(\\mu)$. The expected repair time is $E[T_r] = 1/\\mu$.\nThe cycle ends upon completion of the repair. The total cycle length is $T_C = T_{\\text{det}} + T_r$. By linearity of expectation:\n$$E[T_C] = E[T_{\\text{det}}] + E[T_r] = \\frac{\\tau}{1 - \\exp(-\\lambda\\tau)} + \\frac{1}{\\mu}$$\n\n**Expected Downtime per Cycle, $E[T_{\\text{down}}]$**\n\nWithin one renewal cycle, the component is in a failed state from the time of failure, $T_f$, until the repair is complete at time $T_C$. The downtime is:\n$$T_{\\text{down}} = T_C - T_f = (T_{\\text{det}} + T_r) - T_f$$\nAgain, using the linearity of expectation:\n$$E[T_{\\text{down}}] = E[T_{\\text{det}}] + E[T_r] - E[T_f]$$\nThe failure time $T_f$ is measured from the beginning of the cycle when the component was as-good-as-new. Therefore, its expectation is simply the mean of the exponential distribution:\n$$E[T_f] = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}$$\nSubstituting the expected values we have found:\n$$E[T_{\\text{down}}] = \\frac{\\tau}{1 - \\exp(-\\lambda\\tau)} + \\frac{1}{\\mu} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda}$$\n\n**Calculation of the Average PFD, $\\bar{q}$**\n\nNow we can compute the average PFD by substituting the expressions for $E[T_{\\text{down}}]$ and $E[T_C]$ into the Renewal Reward Theorem formula:\n$$\\bar{q} = \\frac{E[T_{\\text{down}}]}{E[T_C]} = \\frac{\\frac{\\tau}{1 - \\exp(-\\lambda\\tau)} + \\frac{1}{\\mu} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda}}{\\frac{\\tau}{1 - \\exp(-\\lambda\\tau)} + \\frac{1}{\\mu}}$$\nThis expression can be simplified by dividing the numerator by the denominator:\n$$\\bar{q} = 1 - \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\lambda}}{\\frac{\\tau}{1 - \\exp(-\\lambda\\tau)} + \\frac{1}{\\mu}}$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the average PFD. All terms are given in the problem statement ($\\lambda$, $\\mu$, and $\\tau$), and the expression is dimensionless, as expected for a probability.\nTo further simplify for the final answer:\n$$\\bar{q} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\lambda\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{1 - \\exp(-\\lambda\\tau)} + \\frac{1}{\\mu}\\right)} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\lambda\\tau}{1 - \\exp(-\\lambda\\tau)} + \\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu}}$$\nThis expression represents the long-run fraction of time the component is in a failed state.",
