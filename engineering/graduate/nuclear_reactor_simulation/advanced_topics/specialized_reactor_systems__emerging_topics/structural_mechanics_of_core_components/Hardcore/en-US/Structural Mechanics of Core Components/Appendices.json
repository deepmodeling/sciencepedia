The second part of the question, concerning the validity of assumptions in a nuclear reactor environment, is grounded in established principles of materials science and nuclear engineering.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. The governing differential equation derived from the given principles, along with the two specified boundary conditions (one for displacement at $x=0$ and one for force/stress at $x=L$), is sufficient to determine a unique solution for the displacement field $u(x)$.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, objective, and unambiguous terminology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. The derivation and analysis will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\nThe derivation proceeds by establishing the governing differential equation and solving it with the appropriate boundary conditions.\n\n**1. Balance of Linear Momentum**\nConsider a differential element of the rod of infinitesimal length $dx$, located between coordinates $x$ and $x+dx$. Let $N(x)$ be the internal axial force at position $x$. For the element to be in static equilibrium, the sum of axial forces must be zero. The force exerted on the left face of the element (at $x$) by the material to its left is $N(x)$. The force exerted on the right face of the element (at $x+dx$) by the material to its right is $-N(x+dx)$.\nSince inertia is negligible and there are no body forces specified, the balance of linear momentum requires:\n$$N(x+dx) - N(x) = 0$$\nDividing by $dx$ and taking the limit as $dx \\to 0$ gives the differential equation for equilibrium:\n$$\\frac{dN}{dx} = 0$$\nThis equation states that the internal axial force $N$ is constant along the length of the rod.\n\n**2. Kinematics and Constitutive Relation**\n- **Small-Strain Kinematics**: For small deformations, the axial strain $\\epsilon(x)$ is defined as the gradient of the axial displacement field $u(x)$:\n$$\\epsilon(x) = \\frac{du}{dx}$$\n- **Linear Elastic Constitutive Relation**: The material is assumed to be linear elastic, isotropic, and homogeneous. The axial stress $\\sigma(x)$ is related to the axial strain $\\epsilon(x)$ by Hooke's Law, where $E$ is the Young's modulus:\n$$\\sigma(x) = E \\epsilon(x)$$\nThe internal force $N(x)$ is the integral of the stress over the cross-sectional area $A$. Assuming the stress is uniform across the section (a consequence of the slender rod assumption via Saint-Venant's principle), we have:\n$$N(x) = \\sigma(x) A$$\nCombining these relations, we can express the internal force in terms of the displacement field:\n$$N(x) = A \\sigma(x) = A E \\epsilon(x) = A E \\frac{du}{dx}$$\n\n**3. Governing Equation and Boundary Conditions**\nSubstituting the expression for $N(x)$ into the equilibrium equation $\\frac{dN}{dx}=0$:\n$$\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(A E \\frac{du}{dx}\\right) = 0$$\nSince $A$ and $E$ are given as uniform constants, this simplifies to the governing ordinary differential equation for the displacement $u(x)$:\n$$A E \\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} = 0 \\implies \\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} = 0$$\nThe problem specifies the boundary conditions:\n- **At $x=0$**: The rod is fixed, so there is no displacement.\n$$u(0) = 0$$\n- **At $x=L$**: A tensile load $P$ is applied. This means the internal force $N$ at this location must equal $P$.\n$$N(L) = P$$\nUsing the relation $N(x) = A E \\frac{du}{dx}$, this boundary condition becomes:\n$$A E \\left.\\frac{du}{dx}\\right|_{x=L} = P \\implies \\left.\\frac{du}{dx}\\right|_{x=L} = \\frac{P}{A E}$$\n\n**4. Solution of the Governing Equation**\nWe solve $\\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} = 0$ by integrating twice with respect to $x$:\n$$\\frac{du}{dx} = C_1$$\n$$u(x) = C_1 x + C_2$$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants of integration.\nApplying the boundary condition at $x=0$:\n$$u(0) = C_1(0) + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2 = 0$$\nThe solution simplifies to $u(x) = C_1 x$.\nNow, apply the boundary condition at $x=L$. First, we find the derivative of the displacement:\n$$\\frac{du}{dx} = C_1$$\nApplying the condition $\\left.\\frac{du}{dx}\\right|_{x=L} = \\frac{P}{A E}$:\n$$C_1 = \\frac{P}{A E}$$\nSubstituting the constants back into the expressions for $u(x)$ and $\\sigma(x)$:\n- **Axial Displacement Field**:\n$$u(x) = \\frac{P}{A E} x$$\n- **Axial Stress Distribution**:\n$$\\sigma(x) = E \\epsilon(x) = E \\frac{du}{dx} = E \\left(\\frac{P}{A E}\\right) = \\frac{P}{A}$$\nThe stress is constant along the rod, which is consistent with the equilibrium equation $\\frac{dN}{dx}=0$.\n\n### Modeling Assumptions and Critique\nThe derivation relies on several idealizing assumptions.\n**Enumeration of Modeling Assumptions:**\n1.  **Homogeneous Material**: The Young's modulus $E$ is constant throughout the volume of the rod.\n2.  **Isotropic Material**: The mechanical properties are identical in all directions.\n3.  **Linear Elasticity**: The material obeys Hooke's Law ($\\sigma = E \\epsilon$), and deformation is fully recoverable upon load removal. No plastic deformation or time-dependent effects are considered.\n4.  **Small Deformations (or Small Strains)**: The strain is small ($\\epsilon \\ll 1$), allowing the use of the simplified kinematic relation $\\epsilon = du/dx$ and neglecting changes in the rod's geometry during deformation.\n5.  **Prismatic Bar and 1D Stress State**: The rod has a constant cross-section $A$, and the stress state is assumed to be purely one-dimensional and uniform across any given cross-section.\n6.  **Static Loading**: The load $P$ is applied slowly such that dynamic effects (waves, vibrations) are negligible.\n7.  **Isothermal Conditions**: The derivation assumes no temperature change. Thermal expansion and temperature dependence of material properties (like $E$) are ignored.\n\n**Invalidated Assumptions in a High-Temperature Irradiation Environment:**\nA nuclear reactor core environment, characterized by high temperature (e.g., $650\\,\\mathrm{K}$ or $377\\,\\mathrm{^\\circ C}$) and sustained neutron flux, invalidates several key assumptions.\n\n1.  **Linear Elasticity (Strongly Invalidated)**: At elevated temperatures, metallic alloys exhibit time-dependent, non-recoverable deformation under constant stress, a phenomenon known as **thermal creep**. The presence of neutron flux further causes **irradiation creep**. The relationship between stress and strain is no longer a simple constant of proportionality but becomes a complex function of stress, temperature, time, and neutron flux. Thus, deformation is not purely elastic.\n\n2.  **Isothermal Conditions / Temperature-Independent Properties (Strongly Invalidated)**:\n    - **Thermal Expansion**: A temperature change from ambient to $650\\,\\mathrm{K}$ would cause significant thermal expansion ($\\epsilon_{th} = \\alpha \\Delta T$, where $\\alpha$ is the coefficient of thermal expansion). This strain component must be added to the mechanical strain, altering the overall displacement and potentially inducing stress if the expansion is constrained.\n    - **Temperature-Dependent Modulus**: The Young's modulus $E$ of metals is not constant but decreases significantly as temperature increases. For a typical steel, $E$ can decrease by $15-20\\%$ between room temperature and $650\\,\\mathrm{K}$. The use of a constant, room-temperature value for $E$ would lead to a substantial underestimation of the actual strain and displacement.\n\n3.  **Homogeneous Material (Partially Invalidated)**: Sustained neutron irradiation creates defects in the material's crystal lattice (e.g., vacancies, interstitials, dislocation loops, voids). The density of this damage is often dependent on the local neutron flux and temperature, which may not be uniform along the component's length. This leads to spatial variations in mechanical properties like strength and ductility, meaning the material is no longer perfectly homogeneous. This effect is known as irradiation hardening and embrittlement.\n\n4.  **Small Deformations (Potentially Invalidated)**: While the elastic deformation may be small, the accumulated strain due to creep over a long operational lifetime (months or years) can become significant. This cumulative strain can be large enough to violate the small-strain assumption, particularly in components designed with tight tolerances.\n\nIn summary, the simple linear elastic, isothermal model is inadequate for accurately predicting the behavior of a structural member in a nuclear reactor core. A realistic analysis would require advanced viscoplastic constitutive models that account for creep, irradiation effects, thermal expansion, and the temperature dependence of material properties.",

            "solution": "The user-provided problem has been validated and is determined to be sound. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution. The problem describes a canonical one-dimensional thermo-mechanical contact problem, utilizing fundamental principles of solid mechanics. The provided material properties and thermal fields are physically plausible for a nuclear fuel rod analysis.\n\nThe solution proceeds by following the algorithmic steps outlined in the problem statement. We aim to find the shear traction $\\tau_{\\text{stick}}(z)$ that must exist at the pellet-clad interface to enforce a no-slip (stick) condition. This requires deriving an expression for $\\tau_{\\text{stick}}(z)$ and then comparing its magnitude to the available frictional resistance, $\\mu p_n$.\n\nFirst, we establish the constitutive relations for the axial forces in the pellet, $N_p(z)$, and the cladding, $N_c(z)$. According to Hooke's law with thermal strains, these are:\n$$N_p(z) = E_p A_p (\\varepsilon_p(z) - \\alpha_p \\Delta T_p(z))$$\n$$N_c(z) = E_c A_c (\\varepsilon_c(z) - \\alpha_c \\Delta T_c(z))$$\nwhere $E$ is Young's modulus, $A$ is the cross-sectional area, $\\varepsilon(z)$ is the total axial strain, $\\alpha$ is the coefficient of thermal expansion, and $\\Delta T(z)$ is the temperature rise. The subscripts $p$ and $c$ denote pellet and cladding, respectively.\n\nThe problem states that under the stick condition, there is no relative axial displacement, which implies that the axial strains in the pellet and cladding are identical at the interface: $\\varepsilon_p(z) = \\varepsilon_c(z) = \\varepsilon(z)$.\n\nFurthermore, the problem specifies force-free ends and no external axial loads. This implies that at any axial location $z$, the sum of the internal axial forces in the pellet and cladding must be zero for static equilibrium of the assembly:\n$$N_p(z) + N_c(z) = 0$$\n\nSubstituting the constitutive relations and the common strain condition into the force balance equation yields:\n$$E_p A_p (\\varepsilon(z) - \\alpha_p \\Delta T_p(z)) + E_c A_c (\\varepsilon(z) - \\alpha_c \\Delta T_c(z)) = 0$$\n\nWe can solve this equation for the common axial strain $\\varepsilon(z)$:\n$$(E_p A_p + E_c A_c) \\varepsilon(z) = E_p A_p \\alpha_p \\Delta T_p(z) + E_c A_c \\alpha_c \\Delta T_c(z)$$\n$$\\varepsilon(z) = \\frac{E_p A_p \\alpha_p \\Delta T_p(z) + E_c A_c \\alpha_c \\Delta T_c(z)}{E_p A_p + E_c A_c}$$\nThis expression shows that the common strain is a weighted average of the free thermal strains of the two components, with the axial stiffnesses $EA$ acting as the weights.\n\nNext, we determine the axial force in the pellet, $N_p(z)$, by substituting the expression for $\\varepsilon(z)$ back into its constitutive equation:\n$$N_p(z) = E_p A_p \\left( \\frac{E_p A_p \\alpha_p \\Delta T_p(z) + E_c A_c \\alpha_c \\Delta T_c(z)}{E_p A_p + E_c A_c} - \\alpha_p \\Delta T_p(z) \\right)$$\nAfter algebraic simplification, this becomes:\n$$N_p(z) = \\frac{E_p A_p E_c A_c}{E_p A_p + E_c A_c} (\\alpha_c \\Delta T_c(z) - \\alpha_p \\Delta T_p(z))$$\nThe term $\\frac{E_p A_p E_c A_c}{E_p A_p + E_c A_c}$ represents an effective axial stiffness for the composite system, which we denote $K_{\\text{eff}}$.\n\nThe shear traction $\\tau_{\\text{stick}}(z)$ required to maintain this state is found from the differential equation for axial equilibrium of the pellet:\n$$\\frac{dN_p}{dz} + P \\tau(z) = 0$$\nThus, the stick shear traction is:\n$$\\tau_{\\text{stick}}(z) = -\\frac{1}{P} \\frac{dN_p}{dz}$$\nTo find the derivative $\\frac{dN_p}{dz}$, we differentiate the expression for $N_p(z)$ with respect to $z$:\n$$\\frac{dN_p}{dz} = K_{\\text{eff}} \\left( \\alpha_c \\frac{d(\\Delta T_c)}{dz} - \\alpha_p \\frac{d(\\Delta T_p)}{dz} \\right)$$\nThe problem provides the temperature fields as functions of a normalized coordinate $\\xi = 2 \\frac{z}{L} - 1$.

            "problem": "Consider a thin-walled nuclear fuel cladding segment subjected to combined hoop and axial loading under small strains. The cladding material is modeled as an isotropic elastoplastic solid obeying the von Mises (second invariant of deviatoric stress (J2)) yield criterion with linear isotropic hardening. Assume the loading is axisymmetric with principal strain components $\\varepsilon_{\\theta}$ (hoop), $\\varepsilon_{z}$ (axial), and $\\varepsilon_{r}$ (radial), and that shear strains are zero. The objective is to derive and implement a return-mapping algorithm for this J2 plasticity model that updates the stress state and the equivalent plastic strain given a total strain state.\n\nDerive the algorithm starting from the following foundational laws and definitions:\n- Linear isotropic elasticity (Hooke's law) in three dimensions: the stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ relates to the strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ through Lamé parameters $\\lambda$ and $G$,\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\lambda \\, \\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) \\, \\mathbf{I} + 2 G \\, \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{dev}},\n$$\nwhere $G = \\dfrac{E}{2(1+\\nu)}$, $\\lambda = \\dfrac{E \\nu}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)}$, $E$ is the Young's modulus, $\\nu$ is the Poisson's ratio, $\\mathbf{I}$ is the identity, and $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{dev}} = \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} - \\dfrac{1}{3} \\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) \\mathbf{I}$ is the deviatoric strain.\n- The deviatoric stress $\\boldsymbol{s} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - \\dfrac{1}{3} \\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) \\mathbf{I}$ and hydrostatic pressure $p = \\dfrac{1}{3} \\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})$.\n- The von Mises equivalent stress,\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\sqrt{3 J_2} = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{3}{2} \\, \\boldsymbol{s}:\\boldsymbol{s}}.\n$$\n- The yield function with linear isotropic hardening,\n$$\nf(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}, \\alpha) = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}} - \\sigma_{y0} - H \\alpha,\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_{y0}$ is the initial yield stress, $H$ is the hardening modulus, and $\\alpha$ is the accumulated equivalent plastic strain.\n- An associative flow rule, where the plastic strain increment $\\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{p}$ is normal to the yield surface:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{p} = \\mathrm{d}\\alpha \\, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = \\mathrm{d}\\alpha \\, \\frac{3}{2} \\frac{\\boldsymbol{s}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}},\n$$\nwhere $\\mathrm{d}\\alpha$ is the increment in the accumulated equivalent plastic strain, which serves as the plastic multiplier.\n\nUse a strain-driven elastoplastic integration over a single increment where the trial elastic predictor is formed by Hooke's law from the total strain, and if yielding occurs, apply a radial return to the yield surface in stress space. Show that this formulation leads to a radial return algorithm where the increment in equivalent plastic strain, $\\Delta\\alpha$, can be solved for, and derive the following key equations of the algorithm:\n- The update for the equivalent stress:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{\\mathrm{corr}} = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{\\mathrm{tr}} - 3 G \\, \\Delta \\alpha\n$$\n- The closed-form expression for the plastic strain increment:\n$$\n\\Delta \\alpha = \\dfrac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{\\mathrm{tr}} - (\\sigma_{y0} + H \\alpha_n)}{3 G + H}\n$$\n- The corrected deviatoric stress:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\mathrm{corr}} = \\left(1 - \\dfrac{3 G \\, \\Delta \\alpha}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{\\mathrm{tr}}}\\right) \\boldsymbol{s}^{\\mathrm{tr}}\n$$\nThe updated equivalent plastic strain is then simply $\\alpha_{n+1} = \\alpha_n + \\Delta \\alpha$, and the corrected Cauchy stress is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\mathrm{corr}} = \\boldsymbol{s}^{\\mathrm{corr}} + p^{\\mathrm{tr}} \\mathbf{I}$, noting that the hydrostatic part remains unchanged because J2 plasticity is isochoric.\n\nYour program must implement this return-mapping algorithm for axisymmetric principal strains $(\\varepsilon_{\\theta}, \\varepsilon_{z}, \\varepsilon_{r})$ with zero shear.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and implementation of a return-mapping algorithm for a $J_2$ plasticity model with linear isotropic hardening, based on a standard, self-consistent formulation.\n\n### Derivation of the Return-Mapping Algorithm\n\nThe algorithm is a strain-driven, implicit elastic-predictor/plastic-corrector scheme. We consider a single increment where the material state (stress $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{n}$, equivalent plastic strain $\\alpha_{n}$) is known at the beginning of the step, and the total strain $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_{n+1}$ is prescribed at the end of the step. For simplicity, we consider the initial state to be strain-free, so the total strain is just $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ and the initial plastic strain is $\\alpha_n$.\n\n#### 1. Elastic Predictor (Trial State)\n\nFirst, we assume the entire strain increment is elastic. The trial stress state, denoted by the superscript `tr`, is computed using Hooke's law. The calculation is split into volumetric and deviatoric parts.\nThe trial hydrostatic pressure $p^{\\text{tr}}$ depends only on the volumetric strain:\n$$\np^{\\text{tr}} = K \\, \\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\n$$\nwhere $K$ is the bulk modulus.\nThe trial deviatoric stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\text{tr}}$ depends only on the deviatoric strain:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\text{tr}} = 2 G \\, \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{\\text{dev}} = 2 G \\left( \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} - \\frac{1}{3} \\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) \\mathbf{I} \\right)\n$$\nThe full trial stress tensor is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{tr}} = \\boldsymbol{s}^{\\text{tr}} + p^{\\text{tr}} \\mathbf{I}$.\n\n#### 2. Yield Check\n\nThe trial state is checked against the yield criterion. The von Mises equivalent stress for the trial state is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{eq}}^{\\text{tr}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2} \\boldsymbol{s}^{\\text{tr}} : \\boldsymbol{s}^{\\text{tr}}}\n$$\nThe yield stress at the beginning of the increment depends on the accumulated plastic strain $\\alpha_n$:\n$$\n\\sigma_y(\\alpha_n) = \\sigma_{y0} + H \\alpha_n\n$$\nThe yield function is evaluated:\n$$\nf(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{tr}}, \\alpha_n) = \\sigma_{\\text{eq}}^{\\text{tr}} - \\sigma_y(\\alpha_n)\n$$\n- If $f \\le 0$, the state is within or on the yield surface. The behavior is elastic. The final state is the trial state: $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{tr}}$ and $\\alpha_{n+1} = \\alpha_n$.\n- If $f > 0$, the trial state is outside the yield surface, which is physically inadmissible. Plastic flow must have occurred, and a correction is required.\n\n#### 3. Plastic Corrector (Return Mapping)\n\nThe goal is to find the true stress $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{n+1}$ on the updated yield surface. The stress update is given by:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{tr}} - \\mathbf{C} : \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p$ is the plastic strain increment. Since plasticity is isochoric, the hydrostatic pressure is unchanged: $p_{n+1} = p^{\\text{tr}}$. The correction only applies to the deviatoric stress:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{s}^{\\text{tr}} - 2G \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p\n$$\nThe associative flow rule states $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p = \\Delta\\alpha \\, \\frac{3}{2} \\frac{\\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1}}{\\sigma_{\\text{eq}, n+1}}$, where $\\Delta\\alpha$ is the plastic multiplier. Substituting this into the deviatoric stress update:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{s}^{\\text{tr}} - 2G \\left( \\Delta\\alpha \\, \\frac{3}{2} \\frac{\\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1}}{\\sigma_{\\text{eq}, n+1}} \\right) = \\boldsymbol{s}^{\\text{tr}} - 3G \\Delta\\alpha \\frac{\\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1}}{\\sigma_{\\text{eq}, n+1}}\n$$\nThis equation shows that $\\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1}$ is co-linear with $\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\text{tr}}$ (the \"radial return\"). This allows us to write:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1} = \\left( 1 - \\frac{3G \\Delta\\alpha}{\\sigma_{\\text{eq}}^{\\text{tr}}} \\right) \\boldsymbol{s}^{\\text{tr}}\n$$\nThis is the requested expression for the corrected deviatoric stress, $\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\text{corr}}$.\nTaking the equivalent stress of both sides gives the update for the equivalent stress:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{eq}, n+1} = \\sigma_{\\text{eq}}^{\\text{tr}} \\left( 1 - \\frac{3G \\Delta\\alpha}{\\sigma_{\\text{eq}}^{\\text{tr}}} \\right) = \\sigma_{\\text{eq}}^{\\text{tr}} - 3G \\Delta\\alpha\n$$\nThis is the corrected equivalent stress, $\\sigma_{\\text{eq}}^{\\text{corr}}$.\n\nFinally, the magnitude of the plastic multiplier, $\\Delta\\alpha$, is found by enforcing the consistency condition: the final stress state must lie on the updated yield surface.\n$$\nf(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{n+1}, \\alpha_{n+1}) = \\sigma_{\\text{eq}, n+1} - (\\sigma_{y0} + H \\alpha_{n+1}) = 0\n$$\nThe updated plastic strain is $\\alpha_{n+1} = \\alpha_n + \\Delta\\alpha$. Substituting the expressions for $\\sigma_{\\text{eq}, n+1}$ and $\\alpha_{n+1}$ into the consistency condition:\n$$\n(\\sigma_{\\text{eq}}^{\\text{tr}} - 3G \\Delta\\alpha) - \\left( \\sigma_{y0} + H (\\alpha_n + \\Delta\\alpha) \\right) = 0\n$$\nRearranging to solve for $\\Delta\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{eq}}^{\\text{tr}} - (\\sigma_{y0} + H\\alpha_n) = 3G \\Delta\\alpha + H \\Delta\\alpha\n$$\nThe left side is the value of the yield function at the trial state, $f(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{tr}}, \\alpha_n)$.\n$$\nf = \\Delta\\alpha (3G + H)\n$$\nThis gives the closed-form expression for the plastic strain increment:\n$$\n\\Delta\\alpha = \\frac{f}{3G + H} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{eq}}^{\\text{tr}} - \\sigma_{y0} - H\\alpha_n}{3G + H}\n$$\nThe full algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Compute the trial state $(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{tr}}, \\sigma_{\\text{eq}}^{\\text{tr}})$.\n2.  Check for yielding: Calculate $f = \\sigma_{\\text{eq}}^{\\text{tr}} - (\\sigma_{y0} + H\\alpha_n)$.\n3.  If $f \\le 0$ (elastic), set $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{tr}}$ and $\\alpha_{n+1}=\\alpha_n$.\n4.  If $f > 0$ (plastic), compute $\\Delta\\alpha$, then update $\\alpha_{n+1} = \\alpha_n + \\Delta\\alpha$ and $\\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1} = (1 - \\frac{3G\\Delta\\alpha}{\\sigma_{\\text{eq}}^{\\text{tr}}})\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\text{tr}}$. The final stress is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1} + p^{\\text{tr}}\\mathbf{I}$.",
