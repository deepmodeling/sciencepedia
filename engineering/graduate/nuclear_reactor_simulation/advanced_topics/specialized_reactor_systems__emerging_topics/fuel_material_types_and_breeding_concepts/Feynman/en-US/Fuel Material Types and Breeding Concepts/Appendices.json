The fuel contains uranium with an enrichment of $4.0$ atom percent $^{235}\\mathrm{U}$, with the balance being $^{238}\\mathrm{U}$. The total uranium atomic number density is $N_{\\mathrm{U}} = 2.40 \\times 10^{22} \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. Assume a steady, spatially uniform neutron flux and neglect all absorbers other than uranium. The one-group microscopic cross sections, averaged over the neutron energy spectrum of interest, are:\n- For $^{235}\\mathrm{U}$: fission $\\,\\sigma_{f,235} = 585 \\ \\mathrm{b}$, radiative capture $\\,\\sigma_{\\gamma,235} = 100 \\ \\mathrm{b}$.\n- For $^{238}\\mathrm{U}$: fission $\\,\\sigma_{f,238} = 0 \\ \\mathrm{b}$, radiative capture $\\,\\sigma_{\\gamma,238} = 2.4 \\ \\mathrm{b}$.\nUse $1 \\ \\mathrm{b} = 10^{-24} \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2}$.

The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution can be formulated.\n\nThe solution proceeds by addressing each of the three tasks outlined in the problem statement. We begin with symbolic derivations based on the provided fundamental definitions.\n\nLet $e$ be the atom percent enrichment of $^{235}\\mathrm{U}$, expressed as a fraction. The number densities of the uranium isotopes are:\n- Number density of $^{235}\\mathrm{U}$: $N_{235} = e \\cdot N_{\\mathrm{U}}$\n- Number density of $^{238}\\mathrm{U}$: $N_{238} = (1-e) \\cdot N_{\\mathrm{U}}$\n\nThe microscopic absorption cross section for an isotope $i$, $\\sigma_{a,i}$, is the sum of its fission and radiative capture cross sections: $\\sigma_{a,i} = \\sigma_{f,i} + \\sigma_{\\gamma,i}$.\n\n1. Derivation of the total macroscopic absorption cross section, $\\Sigma_{a,\\mathrm{fuel}}$:\nThe macroscopic cross section for a given reaction in a mixture is the sum of the macroscopic cross sections of that reaction for each constituent nuclide. Thus, the total macroscopic absorption cross section for the fuel, $\\Sigma_{a,\\mathrm{fuel}}$, is the sum of the absorption contributions from $^{235}\\mathrm{U}$ and $^{238}\\mathrm{U}$.\n$$ \\Sigma_{a,\\mathrm{fuel}} = \\Sigma_{a,235} + \\Sigma_{a,238} $$\nUsing the definition $\\Sigma = N \\sigma$, we expand this expression:\n$$ \\Sigma_{a,\\mathrm{fuel}} = N_{235} \\sigma_{a,235} + N_{238} \\sigma_{a,238} $$\nSubstituting the definitions for microscopic absorption cross sections:\n$$ \\Sigma_{a,\\mathrm{fuel}} = N_{235} (\\sigma_{f,235} + \\sigma_{\\gamma,235}) + N_{238} (\\sigma_{f,238} + \\sigma_{\\gamma,238}) $$\nThe contribution from the fertile isotope $^{238}\\mathrm{U}$ is explicitly the second term, $N_{238} (\\sigma_{f,238} + \\sigma_{\\gamma,238})$. Since the problem states $\\sigma_{f,238} = 0 \\ \\mathrm{b}$, this contribution simplifies to $N_{238} \\sigma_{\\gamma,238}$, representing parasitic neutron absorption via radiative capture.\n\n2. Derivation and interpretation of the fraction of fissions, $f_{f}$:\nThe fraction of all fuel absorptions that lead to fission is defined as $f_{f} = \\Sigma_{f,\\mathrm{fuel}} / \\Sigma_{a,\\mathrm{fuel}}$.\nFirst, we express the total macroscopic fission cross section, $\\Sigma_{f,\\mathrm{fuel}}$:\n$$ \\Sigma_{f,\\mathrm{fuel}} = \\Sigma_{f,235} + \\Sigma_{f,238} = N_{235} \\sigma_{f,235} + N_{238} \\sigma_{f,238} $$\nGiven that $\\sigma_{f,238} = 0$, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\Sigma_{f,\\mathrm{fuel}} = N_{235} \\sigma_{f,235} $$\nNow, we can write the expression for $f_f$ using the results from part 1:\n$$ f_{f} = \\frac{\\Sigma_{f,\\mathrm{fuel}}}{\\Sigma_{a,\\mathrm{fuel}}} = \\frac{N_{235} \\sigma_{f,235}}{N_{235} (\\sigma_{f,235} + \\sigma_{\\gamma,235}) + N_{238} (\\sigma_{f,238} + \\sigma_{\\gamma,238})} $$\nInterpretation: In a hypothetical case with only $^{235}\\mathrm{U}$ present ($N_{238}=0$), this fraction would be $f_{f,\\text{pure}} = \\frac{N_{235}\\sigma_{f,235}}{N_{235}(\\sigma_{f,235} + \\sigma_{\\gamma,235})} = \\frac{\\sigma_{f,235}}{\\sigma_{a,235}}$. The presence of fertile $^{238}\\mathrm{U}$ adds a positive term, $N_{238} \\sigma_{\\gamma,238}$, to the denominator. This increases the total absorption rate without increasing the fission rate. Consequently, the fraction of absorptions leading to fission, $f_f$, is lower in the uranium mixture than it would be in pure $^{235}\\mathrm{U}$. The $^{238}\\mathrm{U}$ acts as a parasitic absorber, reducing the neutronic efficiency of the fuel with respect to fission.\n\n3. Definition and computation of the effective fuel reproduction factor, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{fuel}}$:\nThe problem defines $\\eta_{\\mathrm{fuel}} = \\nu_{235} \\, \\Sigma_{f,235} / \\Sigma_{a,\\mathrm{fuel}}$. Note that $\\Sigma_{f,235} = N_{235}\\sigma_{f,235}$, which is identical to $\\Sigma_{f,\\mathrm{fuel}}$ in this problem. Physically, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{fuel}}$ represents the average number of new fission neutrons produced per neutron absorbed in the fuel mixture. Using our previous results:\n$$ \\eta_{\\mathrm{fuel}} = \\frac{\\nu_{235} (N_{235} \\sigma_{f,235})}{N_{235} (\\sigma_{f,235} + \\sigma_{\\gamma,235}) + N_{238} (\\sigma_{\\gamma,238})} $$\nTo compute the value, we can express the isotopic number densities in terms of the total uranium density $N_{\\mathrm{U}}$ and the enrichment $e$:\n$$ \\eta_{\\mathrm{fuel}} = \\frac{\\nu_{235} (e N_{\\mathrm{U}}) \\sigma_{f,235}}{(e N_{\\mathrm{U}})(\\sigma_{f,235} + \\sigma_{\\gamma,235}) + ((1-e)N_{\\mathrm{U}})(\\sigma_{\\gamma,238})} $$\nThe total uranium number density $N_{\\mathrm{U}}$ cancels from the numerator and denominator, which is expected as $\\eta_{\\mathrm{fuel}}$ is an intensive property of the fuel material composition.\n$$ \\eta_{\\mathrm{fuel}} = \\frac{\\nu_{235} e \\sigma_{f,235}}{e (\\sigma_{f,235} + \\sigma_{\\gamma,235}) + (1-e) \\sigma_{\\gamma,238}} $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this symbolic expression. The cross sections can be used in units of barns ($\\mathrm{b}$) as they appear in a ratio.\n- $e = 0.040$ (for $4.0$ atom percent)\n- $\\nu_{235} = 2.43$\n- $\\sigma_{f,235} = 585 \\ \\mathrm{b}$\n- $\\sigma_{\\gamma,235} = 100 \\ \\mathrm{b}$\n- $\\sigma_{\\gamma,238} = 2.4 \\ \\mathrm{b}$\n\nNumerator:\n$$ \\nu_{235} e \\sigma_{f,235} = 2.43 \\times 0.040 \\times 585 = 56.862 $$\nDenominator:\n$$ e (\\sigma_{f,235} + \\sigma_{\\gamma,235}) + (1-e) \\sigma_{\\gamma,238} = 0.040 \\times (585 + 100) + (1-0.040) \\times 2.4 $$\n$$ = 0.040 \\times 685 + 0.960 \\times 2.4 $$\n$$ = 27.4 + 2.304 = 29.704 $$\nFinally, we compute the ratio for $\\eta_{\\mathrm{fuel}}$:\n$$ \\eta_{\\mathrm{fuel}} = \\frac{56.862}{29.704} \\approx 1.914300... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, as requested, gives $1.914$.",

Suppose the reactor is adjusted to criticality, so that exactly $1$ neutron per generation is required to sustain the chain by absorption in the fissile fuel. Assume neutron leakage is negligible and that non-fertile parasitic captures in moderator/structure consume a fixed $x = 0.15$ neutrons per fissile absorption, independent of the fissile isotope. All remaining neutrons (if any) are captured in $^{232}\\mathrm{Th}$ and eventually yield $^{233}\\mathrm{U}$, ignoring losses during the $^{233}\\mathrm{Pa}$ decay chain for the purpose of this estimate.

The concepts of reproduction factor, microscopic cross sections, neutron balance, criticality, and conversion ratio are fundamental to the field. The provided nuclear data for $^{233}\\mathrm{U}$ and $^{235}\\mathrm{U}$ at thermal energy are consistent with standard evaluated nuclear data files (e.g., ENDF/B). The assumptions—such as an infinite homogeneous medium, single energy group, and negligible leakage—are standard idealizations used to simplify complex reactor analysis and to isolate and illustrate core physical principles, particularly the theoretical breeding potential of different fuel cycles.\n\nThe problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary definitions, data, and constraints to calculate the requested quantities ($\\eta$ for both isotopes) and to perform the subsequent neutron balance analysis for the conversion ratio. The language is objective and precise, and the setup is free from internal contradictions or factual errors. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived based on the provided information.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe first step is to calculate the reproduction factor, $\\eta$, for each fissile isotope. The reproduction factor is defined as the average number of neutrons produced per neutron absorbed in the fuel. This can be expressed as the product of the average number of neutrons emitted per fission ($\\nu$) and the probability that a neutron absorption in the fuel leads to fission.\n\nThe probability of fission per absorption is the ratio of the fission cross section ($\\sigma_f$) to the total absorption cross section ($\\sigma_a$). The total absorption cross section is the sum of the fission and radiative capture cross sections, $\\sigma_a = \\sigma_f + \\sigma_\\gamma$.\n\nThus, the formula for $\\eta$ is:\n$$\n\\eta = \\nu \\times \\frac{\\sigma_f}{\\sigma_f + \\sigma_\\gamma}\n$$\n\n**For $^{233}\\mathrm{U}$:**\nUsing the provided data: $\\nu_{233} = 2.49$, $\\sigma_{f,233} = 531\\,\\mathrm{b}$, and $\\sigma_{\\gamma,233} = 46\\,\\mathrm{b}$.\nThe total absorption cross section for $^{233}\\mathrm{U}$ is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{a,233} = \\sigma_{f,233} + \\sigma_{\\gamma,233} = 531\\,\\mathrm{b} + 46\\,\\mathrm{b} = 577\\,\\mathrm{b}\n$$\nThe reproduction factor for $^{233}\\mathrm{U}$ is:\n$$\n\\eta_{233} = 2.49 \\times \\frac{531}{577} \\approx 2.2908\n$$\n\n**For $^{235}\\mathrm{U}$:**\nUsing the provided data: $\\nu_{235} = 2.43$, $\\sigma_{f,235} = 585\\,\\mathrm{b}$, and $\\sigma_{\\gamma,235} = 98\\,\\mathrm{b}$.\nThe total absorption cross section for $^{235}\\mathrm{U}$ is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{a,235} = \\sigma_{f,235} + \\sigma_{\\gamma,235} = 585\\,\\mathrm{b} + 98\\,\\mathrm{b} = 683\\,\\mathrm{b}\n$$\nThe reproduction factor for $^{235}\\mathrm{U}$ is:\n$$\n\\eta_{235} = 2.43 \\times \\frac{585}{683} \\approx 2.0845\n$$\n\nComparing the two values, $\\eta_{233} \\approx 2.29$ is significantly higher than $\\eta_{235} \\approx 2.08$.\n\nNext, we assess the potential for a net conversion ratio above unity (i.e., breeding, where the Conversion Ratio $CR > 1$). The problem sets up a neutron balance per neutron absorbed in the fissile fuel. For each such absorption, $\\eta$ neutrons are produced. These neutrons are distributed as follows:\n- $1$ neutron is required to be absorbed in another fissile nucleus to maintain criticality.\n- $x = 0.15$ neutrons are lost to parasitic capture in non-fertile materials.\n- $L=0$ neutrons are lost to leakage (assumed negligible).\n- The remaining neutrons, $C$, are available for capture in the fertile material ($^{232}\\mathrm{Th}$).\n\nThe neutron balance equation is:\n$$\n\\eta = 1 + x + L + C\n$$\nSubstituting the given values, $x=0.15$ and $L=0$:\n$$\n\\eta = 1 + 0.15 + C \\implies C = \\eta - 1.15\n$$\nThe Conversion Ratio ($CR$) is the rate of fertile-to-fissile conversions divided by the rate of fissile atom consumption. In this framework, this is simply the number of neutrons captured in fertile material, $C$, per fissile atom consumed (which is $1$ by definition of the balance). Therefore, $CR = C = \\eta - 1.15$.\n\nFor a net conversion ratio above unity (breeding), we must have $CR > 1$. This implies:\n$$\n\\eta - 1.15 > 1 \\implies \\eta > 2.15\n$$\n\n**Assessing $^{233}\\mathrm{U}$:**\nWe calculated $\\eta_{233} \\approx 2.2908$. Since $2.2908 > 2.15$, a net conversion ratio above unity is theoretically achievable. The specific conversion ratio would be:\n$$\nCR_{233} = \\eta_{233} - 1.15 \\approx 2.2908 - 1.15 = 1.1408\n$$\n\n**Assessing $^{235}\\mathrm{U}$:**\nWe calculated $\\eta_{235} \\approx 2.0845$. Since $2.0845  2.15$, a net conversion ratio above unity is not achievable under these conditions. The conversion ratio would be:\n$$\nCR_{235} = \\eta_{235} - 1.15 \\approx 2.0845 - 1.15 = 0.9345\n$$\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n- **A. In the thermal spectrum defined, $^{233}\\mathrm{U}$ has a higher reproduction factor than $^{235}\\mathrm{U}$. With non-fertile parasitic captures $x = 0.15$ and negligible leakage, a net conversion ratio above unity is theoretically achievable with $^{233}\\mathrm{U}$ but not with $^{235}\\mathrm{U}$.**\n  - Our calculation showed $\\eta_{233} \\approx 2.29$ and $\\eta_{235} \\approx 2.08$, so the first statement is correct.\n  - Our breeding analysis showed that the condition $\\eta > 2.15$ is met by $^{233}\\mathrm{U}$ but not by $^{235}\\mathrm{U}$. Thus, the second statement is also correct.\n  - **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B. Because $^{235}\\mathrm{U}$ has a larger thermal fission cross section than $^{233}\\mathrm{U}$, its reproduction factor in a thermal spectrum must be higher, implying thorium breeding is easier with $^{235}\\mathrm{U}$.**\n  - The premise that $\\sigma_{f,235} > \\sigma_{f,233}$ ($585\\,\\mathrm{b} > 531\\,\\mathrm{b}$) is true. However, the conclusion that $\\eta_{235}$ must be higher is false. The reproduction factor $\\eta$ also depends on $\\nu$ and $\\sigma_{\\gamma}$. For $^{235}\\mathrm{U}$, the lower $\\nu$ and much higher ratio of capture-to-fission ($\\sigma_{\\gamma}/\\sigma_f$) result in a lower $\\eta$ value, as demonstrated by our calculation. The reasoning is flawed and the conclusion is incorrect.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C. Even if $^{233}\\mathrm{U}$ has a higher reproduction factor in a thermal spectrum, breeding on thorium in thermal systems is impossible regardless of parasitic capture levels, because an absorption in $^{232}\\mathrm{Th}$ requires more than one neutron to produce $^{233}\\mathrm{U}$.**\n  - The reasoning provided is factually incorrect. The production of $^{233}\\mathrm{U}$ from $^{232}\\mathrm{Th}$ is initiated by the capture of a single neutron: $^{232}\\mathrm{Th}(n,\\gamma)^{233}\\mathrm{Th}$, which then beta-decays to $^{233}\\mathrm{U}$. The premise is false.\n  - Furthermore, the claim that breeding is impossible \"regardless of parasitic capture levels\" is also false. In an idealized system with zero parasitic capture ($x=0$) and zero leakage, the condition for breeding becomes $\\eta > 2$. Since $\\eta_{233} \\approx 2.29 > 2$, breeding would be possible.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. The difference between the reproduction factors of $^{233}\\mathrm{U}$ and $^{235}\\mathrm{U}$ is negligible in practical thermal reactors, so conversion ratio cannot exceed unity for thorium even with optimized designs.**\n  - The calculated difference is $\\eta_{233} - \\eta_{235} \\approx 2.29 - 2.08 = 0.21$. This difference of about $10\\%$ is far from negligible; it is the fundamental reason why thermal breeding is feasible with the Th-$^{233}$U cycle but not with a $^{235}$U-fueled thorium cycle. The conclusion that the conversion ratio cannot exceed unity is also incorrect for the $^{233}\\mathrm{U}$ case.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **E. The higher reproduction factor of $^{233}\\mathrm{U}$ implies that, after allocating $1$ neutron to sustain criticality and $x = 0.15$ neutrons to non-fertile parasitic captures, at least about $1.14$ neutrons per fissile absorption remain for capture in $^{232}\\mathrm{Th}$, enabling net fissile production if $^{233}\\mathrm{Pa}$ losses are controlled.**\n  - This option correctly calculates the number of neutrons available for breeding, $C = CR = \\eta_{233} - 1 - x \\approx 2.2908 - 1 - 0.15 = 1.1408$. The value \"about $1.14$\" is correct.\n  - Since this value is greater than $1$, it enables \"net fissile production\" (breeding). The mention of $^{233}\\mathrm{Pa}$ losses is a correct acknowledgement of a practical consideration that was idealized away in the problem statement. Every part of this statement is consistent with our derivation.\n  - **Verdict: Correct.**",

Then, starting from the narrow-resonance approximation and the definition of a background cross section $\\sigma_{b}$ that represents all non-resonant processes which “flatten” the resonance, show how $C$ modifies the heterogeneous background seen by $^{238}\\mathrm{U}$ such that\n$$\n\\sigma_{b} = \\sigma_{b,f} + (1 - C)\\,\\sigma_{b,m}^{(0)} \\, ,\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_{b,f}$ is the in-kernel non-resonant background (fuel-only) microscopic cross section and $\\sigma_{b,m}^{(0)}$ is the moderator contribution to the background that would be seen in the absence of inter-kernel coupling. Finally, use the narrow-resonance result to obtain the resonance self-shielding factor $g$ in terms of $\\sigma_{0}$ and $\\sigma_{b}$, and evaluate $g$ numerically for the following physically plausible parameters:\n- Kernel radius $r = 0.05 \\,\\mathrm{cm}$,\n- Kernel volume fraction $f = 0.05$,\n- Moderator total macroscopic cross section near the resonance $\\Sigma_{t,m} = 0.35 \\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$,\n- $^{238}\\mathrm{U}$ resonance peak microscopic cross section $\\sigma_{0} = 1200 \\,\\mathrm{b}$,\n- Fuel background microscopic cross section $\\sigma_{b,f} = 8 \\,\\mathrm{b}$,\n- Zero-coupling moderator background microscopic cross section $\\sigma_{b,m}^{(0)} = 20 \\,\\mathrm{b}$.\n\nExpress the final answer as the dimensionless resonance self-shielding factor $g$.

            "solution": "This problem requires a multi-step derivation and calculation in the field of nuclear reactor physics, specifically concerning resonance self-shielding in a heterogeneous medium. The solution will proceed in four parts: first, the derivation of the Dancoff factor $C$; second, a physical justification for the given formula for the background cross section $\\sigma_b$; third, the derivation of the resonance self-shielding factor $g$ under the narrow-resonance approximation; and fourth, the numerical evaluation of $g$ using the provided parameters.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Dancoff Factor $C$**\n\nThe problem defines the Dancoff factor $C$ as the probability that a neutron, having escaped a fuel kernel, will enter another kernel before interacting with the moderator. The model prescribed is a competition between two independent exponential processes: (1) traveling to and hitting another fuel kernel, and (2) interacting within the moderator.\n\nLet the path length traveled by a neutron through the moderator be $s$. The probability of interacting in the moderator over a small path $ds$ is $\\Sigma_{t,m} ds$, where $\\Sigma_{t,m}$ is the moderator's total macroscopic cross section. This implies the rate of moderator interaction per unit path length is $\\lambda_m = \\Sigma_{t,m}$.\n\nThe rate of hitting another fuel kernel, $\\lambda_h$, can be modeled as the macroscopic \"target\" cross section presented by the randomly distributed kernels. The number density of fuel kernels, $N_k$, is the total volume fraction of fuel, $f$, divided by the volume of a single spherical kernel, $V_k = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.\n$$N_k = \\frac{f}{V_k} = \\frac{f}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3}$$\nFor a neutron traversing the moderator, each kernel presents a geometric cross-sectional area of $\\sigma_{\\text{geom}} = \\pi r^2$. The macroscopic \"hit\" cross section is then the product of the kernel number density and the geometric cross section:\n$$\\lambda_h = \\Sigma_{\\text{hit}} = N_k \\sigma_{\\text{geom}} = \\left(\\frac{f}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3}\\right) (\\pi r^2) = \\frac{3f}{4r}$$\nThe competition between these two processes (hitting a kernel vs. interacting in the moderator) is a classic problem involving independent exponential distributions with rates $\\lambda_h$ and $\\lambda_m$. The probability that the \"hit\" event occurs before the \"interaction\" event is given by the ratio of its rate to the total rate of any event occurring:\n$$C = \\frac{\\lambda_h}{\\lambda_h + \\lambda_m}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the rates:\n$$C = \\frac{\\frac{3f}{4r}}{\\frac{3f}{4r} + \\Sigma_{t,m}}$$\nThis can be algebraically rearranged to:\n$$C = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{4r\\Sigma_{t,m}}{3f}}$$\nThis is the desired expression for the Dancoff factor as a function of $f$, $r$, and $\\Sigma_{t,m}$.\n\n**Part 2: Justification of the Background Cross Section $\\sigma_b$**\n\nThe background cross section per absorber atom, $\\sigma_b$, represents the effective cross section of all non-resonant scattering and absorption processes that a resonance neutron can experience. In a heterogeneous system, this is composed of contributions from the fuel kernel itself and from the surrounding moderator.\n\nThe term $\\sigma_{b,f}$ is the microscopic background cross section from non-resonant interactions within the fuel material. Any neutron within a fuel kernel is subject to this background.\n\nA neutron that escapes a fuel kernel enters the moderator. Here, it faces two possibilities: it can re-enter another fuel kernel (an event governed by the Dancoff factor $C$), or it can have an interaction in the moderator. The probability that it interacts in the moderator before striking another fuel kernel is, by definition, $1 - C$.\n\nThe term $\\sigma_{b,m}^{(0)}$ is defined as the moderator's contribution to the background cross section in the limiting case of no inter-kernel coupling (i.e., an isolated kernel in an infinite moderator, where $C=0$). This term effectively represents the moderator scattering cross section, appropriately homogenized and expressed per fuel absorber atom.\n\nIn the coupled system, the full moderator contribution $\\sigma_{b,m}^{(0)}$ is only \"seen\" by a neutron if it actually interacts in the moderator. Since this event happens with probability $1-C$ for a neutron that has escaped a kernel, the effective contribution of the moderator to the total background cross section is reduced by this factor. Therefore, the total background cross section is the sum of the in-kernel background and the Dancoff-corrected moderator background:\n$$\\sigma_{b} = \\sigma_{b,f} + (1 - C)\\,\\sigma_{b,m}^{(0)}$$\nThis formula, provided by the problem, is thus physically justified by the probabilistic interpretation of the Dancoff factor within the framework of equivalence theory for heterogeneous systems.\n\n**Part 3: Derivation of the Resonance Self-Shielding Factor $g$**\n\nThe resonance self-shielding factor, $g$, quantifies the reduction in the effective resonance absorption due to flux depression at the resonance energy. It is defined as the ratio of the actual (shielded) reaction rate to the reaction rate that would occur in an unperturbed flux (the infinitely dilute case).\n$$g = \\frac{\\text{Shielded Reaction Rate}}{\\text{Unshielded Reaction Rate}} = \\frac{\\int \\sigma_a(E) \\phi(E) dE}{\\int \\sigma_a(E) \\phi_{\\text{unshielded}} dE}$$\nIn the narrow-resonance (NR) approximation for a homogeneous system with background cross section $\\sigma_b$, the flux $\\phi(E)$ across the resonance is related to the unshielded asymptotic flux $\\phi_{\\text{unshielded}}$ by:\n$$\\phi(E) = \\phi_{\\text{unshielded}} \\frac{\\sigma_b}{\\sigma_t(E)}$$\nwhere $\\sigma_t(E)$ is the total microscopic cross section per absorber atom. The problem statement provides the Breit-Wigner form for the absorption cross section $\\sigma_a(E)$ of a capture resonance. This implies that the resonance scattering is negligible compared to resonance absorption, so we can approximate the total microscopic cross section as the sum of the resonance absorption and the total background: $\\sigma_t(E) \\approx \\sigma_a(E) + \\sigma_b$.\nSubstituting this into the definition of $g$:\n$$g = \\frac{\\int \\sigma_a(E) \\left(\\phi_{\\text{unshielded}} \\frac{\\sigma_b}{\\sigma_a(E) + \\sigma_b}\\right) dE}{\\int \\sigma_a(E) \\phi_{\\text{unshielded}} dE} = \\frac{\\sigma_b \\int \\frac{\\sigma_a(E)}{\\sigma_a(E) + \\sigma_b} dE}{\\int \\sigma_a(E) dE}$$\nTo evaluate these integrals, we use the given form $\\sigma_a(E) = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{1+x^2}$, where $x = (E-E_0)/\\Gamma$. Then $dE = \\Gamma dx$. The integration is performed over the full energy width of the resonance, which corresponds to $x$ from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$.\n\nThe denominator is:\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\sigma_a(x) \\Gamma dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sigma_0 \\Gamma}{1+x^2} dx = \\sigma_0 \\Gamma [\\arctan(x)]_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} = \\sigma_0 \\Gamma \\pi$$\nThe numerator integral is:\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sigma_a(x)}{\\sigma_a(x) + \\sigma_b} \\Gamma dx = \\Gamma \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\frac{\\sigma_0}{1+x^2}}{\\frac{\\sigma_0}{1+x^2} + \\sigma_b} dx = \\Gamma \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sigma_0}{\\sigma_0 + \\sigma_b(1+x^2)} dx$$\n$$= \\Gamma \\sigma_0 \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(\\sigma_0+\\sigma_b) + \\sigma_b x^2} dx = \\frac{\\Gamma \\sigma_0}{\\sigma_b} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sigma_0+\\sigma_b}{\\sigma_b} + x^2} dx$$\nLetting $A^2 = \\frac{\\sigma_0+\\sigma_b}{\\sigma_b}$, the integral is of the form $\\int \\frac{1}{A^2+x^2}dx = \\frac{1}{A}\\arctan(\\frac{x}{A})$.\n$$\\frac{\\Gamma \\sigma_0}{\\sigma_b} \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_0+\\sigma_b}{\\sigma_b}}} \\arctan\\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_0+\\sigma_b}{\\sigma_b}}}\\right) \\right]_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} = \\frac{\\Gamma \\sigma_0}{\\sigma_b} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_b}{\\sigma_0+\\sigma_b}} \\pi = \\frac{\\Gamma \\sigma_0 \\pi}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_b(\\sigma_0+\\sigma_b)}}$$\nThe numerator of the expression for $g$ is $\\sigma_b$ times this result:\n$$\\text{Numerator} = \\sigma_b \\cdot \\frac{\\Gamma \\sigma_0 \\pi}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_b(\\sigma_0+\\sigma_b)}} = \\frac{\\Gamma \\sigma_0 \\pi \\sqrt{\\sigma_b}}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_0+\\sigma_b}}$$\nFinally, dividing the numerator by the denominator:\n$$g = \\frac{\\frac{\\Gamma \\sigma_0 \\pi \\sqrt{\\sigma_b}}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_0+\\sigma_b}}}{\\Gamma \\sigma_0 \\pi} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_b}{\\sigma_0+\\sigma_b}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + \\sigma_0/\\sigma_b}}$$\n\n**Part 4: Numerical Evaluation**\n\nThe problem provides the following parameters:\n- $r = 0.05 \\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n- $f = 0.05$\n- $\\Sigma_{t,m} = 0.35 \\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\n- $\\sigma_{0} = 1200 \\,\\mathrm{b}$\n- $\\sigma_{b,f} = 8 \\,\\mathrm{b}$\n- $\\sigma_{b,m}^{(0)} = 20 \\,\\mathrm{b}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the Dancoff factor $C$:\n$$\\frac{4r\\Sigma_{t,m}}{3f} = \\frac{4(0.05)(0.35)}{3(0.05)} = \\frac{4(0.35)}{3} = \\frac{1.4}{3} = \\frac{7}{15}$$\n$$C = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{7}{15}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{22}{15}} = \\frac{15}{22}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total background cross section $\\sigma_b$:\n$$1-C = 1 - \\frac{15}{22} = \\frac{7}{22}$$\n$$\\sigma_b = \\sigma_{b,f} + (1 - C)\\sigma_{b,m}^{(0)} = 8 \\,\\mathrm{b} + \\left(\\frac{7}{22}\\right)(20 \\,\\mathrm{b}) = 8 + \\frac{140}{22} = 8 + \\frac{70}{11} \\,\\mathrm{b}$$\n$$\\sigma_b = \\frac{88 + 70}{11} \\,\\mathrm{b} = \\frac{158}{11} \\,\\mathrm{b}$$\nNumerically, $\\sigma_b \\approx 14.3636 \\,\\mathrm{b}$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the self-shielding factor $g$:\n$$\\frac{\\sigma_0}{\\sigma_b} = \\frac{1200}{158/11} = \\frac{1200 \\times 11}{158} = \\frac{13200}{158} = \\frac{6600}{79}$$\n$$g = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{\\sigma_0}{\\sigma_b}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{6600}{79}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{79+6600}{79}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{79}{6679}}$$\n$$g \\approx \\sqrt{0.0118281} \\approx 0.1087571$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the resonance self-shielding factor is $0.1088$.",
