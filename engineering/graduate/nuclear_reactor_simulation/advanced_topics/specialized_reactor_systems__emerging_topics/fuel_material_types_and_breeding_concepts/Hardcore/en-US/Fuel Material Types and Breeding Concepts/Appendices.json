The total uranium atomic number density is $N_{\\mathrm{U}} = 2.40 \\times 10^{22} \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. Assume a steady, spatially uniform neutron flux and neglect all absorbers other than uranium.

The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution can be formulated.\n\nThe solution proceeds by addressing each of the three tasks outlined in the problem statement. We begin with symbolic derivations based on the provided fundamental definitions.\n\nLet $e$ be the atom percent enrichment of $^{235}\\mathrm{U}$, expressed as a fraction. The number densities of the uranium isotopes are:\n- Number density of $^{235}\\mathrm{U}$: $N_{235} = e \\cdot N_{\\mathrm{U}}$\n- Number density of $^{238}\\mathrm{U}$: $N_{238} = (1-e) \\cdot N_{\\mathrm{U}}$\n\nThe microscopic absorption cross section for an isotope $i$, $\\sigma_{a,i}$, is the sum of its fission and radiative capture cross sections: $\\sigma_{a,i} = \\sigma_{f,i} + \\sigma_{\\gamma,i}$.\n\n1. Derivation of the total macroscopic absorption cross section, $\\Sigma_{a,\\mathrm{fuel}}$:\nThe macroscopic cross section for a given reaction in a mixture is the sum of the macroscopic cross sections of that reaction for each constituent nuclide. Thus, the total macroscopic absorption cross section for the fuel, $\\Sigma_{a,\\mathrm{fuel}}$, is the sum of the absorption contributions from $^{235}\\mathrm{U}$ and $^{238}\\mathrm{U}$.\n$$ \\Sigma_{a,\\mathrm{fuel}} = \\Sigma_{a,235} + \\Sigma_{a,238} $$\nUsing the definition $\\Sigma = N \\sigma$, we expand this expression:\n$$ \\Sigma_{a,\\mathrm{fuel}} = N_{235} \\sigma_{a,235} + N_{238} \\sigma_{a,238} $$\nSubstituting the definitions for microscopic absorption cross sections:\n$$ \\Sigma_{a,\\mathrm{fuel}} = N_{235} (\\sigma_{f,235} + \\sigma_{\\gamma,235}) + N_{238} (\\sigma_{f,238} + \\sigma_{\\gamma,238}) $$\nThe contribution from the fertile isotope $^{238}\\mathrm{U}$ is explicitly the second term, $N_{238} (\\sigma_{f,238} + \\sigma_{\\gamma,238})$. Since the problem states $\\sigma_{f,238} = 0 \\ \\mathrm{b}$, this contribution simplifies to $N_{238} \\sigma_{\\gamma,238}$, representing parasitic neutron absorption via radiative capture.\n\n2. Derivation and interpretation of the fraction of fissions, $f_{f}$:\nThe fraction of all fuel absorptions that lead to fission is defined as $f_{f} = \\Sigma_{f,\\mathrm{fuel}} / \\Sigma_{a,\\mathrm{fuel}}$.\nFirst, we express the total macroscopic fission cross section, $\\Sigma_{f,\\mathrm{fuel}}$:\n$$ \\Sigma_{f,\\mathrm{fuel}} = \\Sigma_{f,235} + \\Sigma_{f,238} = N_{235} \\sigma_{f,235} + N_{238} \\sigma_{f,238} $$\nGiven that $\\sigma_{f,238} = 0$, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\Sigma_{f,\\mathrm{fuel}} = N_{235} \\sigma_{f,235} $$\nNow, we can write the expression for $f_f$ using the results from part 1:\n$$ f_{f} = \\frac{\\Sigma_{f,\\mathrm{fuel}}}{\\Sigma_{a,\\mathrm{fuel}}} = \\frac{N_{235} \\sigma_{f,235}}{N_{235} (\\sigma_{f,235} + \\sigma_{\\gamma,235}) + N_{238} (\\sigma_{f,238} + \\sigma_{\\gamma,238})} $$\nInterpretation: In a hypothetical case with only $^{235}\\mathrm{U}$ present ($N_{238}=0$), this fraction would be $f_{f,\\text{pure}} = \\frac{N_{235}\\sigma_{f,235}}{N_{235}(\\sigma_{f,235} + \\sigma_{\\gamma,235})} = \\frac{\\sigma_{f,235}}{\\sigma_{a,235}}$. The presence of fertile $^{238}\\mathrm{U}$ adds a positive term, $N_{238} \\sigma_{\\gamma,238}$, to the denominator. This increases the total absorption rate without increasing the fission rate. Consequently, the fraction of absorptions leading to fission, $f_f$, is lower in the uranium mixture than it would be in pure $^{235}\\mathrm{U}$. The $^{238}\\mathrm{U}$ acts as a parasitic absorber, reducing the neutronic efficiency of the fuel with respect to fission.\n\n3. Definition and computation of the effective fuel reproduction factor, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{fuel}}$:\nThe problem defines $\\eta_{\\mathrm{fuel}} = \\nu_{235} \\, \\Sigma_{f,235} / \\Sigma_{a,\\mathrm{fuel}}$. Note that $\\Sigma_{f,235} = N_{235}\\sigma_{f,235}$, which is identical to $\\Sigma_{f,\\mathrm{fuel}}$ in this problem. Physically, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{fuel}}$ represents the average number of new fission neutrons produced per neutron absorbed in the fuel mixture. Using our previous results:\n$$ \\eta_{\\mathrm{fuel}} = \\frac{\\nu_{235} (N_{235} \\sigma_{f,235})}{N_{235} (\\sigma_{f,235} + \\sigma_{\\gamma,235}) + N_{238} (\\sigma_{\\gamma,238})} $$\nTo compute the value, we can express the isotopic number densities in terms of the total uranium density $N_{\\mathrm{U}}$ and the enrichment $e$:\n$$ \\eta_{\\mathrm{fuel}} = \\frac{\\nu_{235} (e N_{\\mathrm{U}}) \\sigma_{f,235}}{(e N_{\\mathrm{U}})(\\sigma_{f,235} + \\sigma_{\\gamma,235}) + ((1-e)N_{\\mathrm{U}})(\\sigma_{\\gamma,238})} $$\nThe total uranium number density $N_{\\mathrm{U}}$ cancels from the numerator and denominator, which is expected as $\\eta_{\\mathrm{fuel}}$ is an intensive property of the fuel material composition.\n$$ \\eta_{\\mathrm{fuel}} = \\frac{\\nu_{235} e \\sigma_{f,235}}{e (\\sigma_{f,235} + \\sigma_{\\gamma,235}) + (1-e) \\sigma_{\\gamma,238}} $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this symbolic expression. The cross sections can be used in units of barns ($\\mathrm{b}$) as they appear in a ratio.\n- $e = 0.040$ (for $4.0$ atom percent)\n- $\\nu_{235} = 2.43$\n- $\\sigma_{f,235} = 585 \\ \\mathrm{b}$\n- $\\sigma_{\\gamma,235} = 100 \\ \\mathrm{b}$\n- $\\sigma_{\\gamma,238} = 2.4 \\ \\mathrm{b}$\n\nNumerator:\n$$ \\nu_{235} e \\sigma_{f,235} = 2.43 \\times 0.040 \\times 585 = 56.862 $$\nDenominator:\n$$ e (\\sigma_{f,235} + \\sigma_{\\gamma,235}) + (1-e) \\sigma_{\\gamma,238} = 0.040 \\times (585 + 100) + (1-0.040) \\times 2.4 $$\n$$ = 0.040 \\times 685 + 0.960 \\times 2.4 $$\n$$ = 27.4 + 2.304 = 29.704 $$\nFinally, we compute the ratio for $\\eta_{\\mathrm{fuel}}$:\n$$ \\eta_{\\mathrm{fuel}} = \\frac{56.862}{29.704} \\approx 1.914300... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, as requested, gives $1.914$.",

Suppose the reactor is adjusted to criticality, so that exactly $1$ neutron per generation is required to sustain the chain by absorption in the fissile fuel. Assume neutron leakage is negligible and that non-fertile parasitic captures in moderator/structure consume a fixed $x = 0.15$ neutrons per fissile absorption, independent of the fissile isotope. All remaining neutrons (if any) are captured in $^{232}\\mathrm{Th}$ and eventually yield $^{233}\\mathrm{U}$, ignoring losses during the $^{233}\\mathrm{Pa}$ decay chain for the purpose of this estimate.

The concepts of reproduction factor, microscopic cross sections, neutron balance, criticality, and conversion ratio are fundamental to the field. The provided nuclear data for $^{233}\\text{U}$ and $^{235}\\text{U}$ at thermal energy are consistent with standard evaluated nuclear data files (e.g., ENDF/B). The assumptions—such as an infinite homogeneous medium, single energy group, and negligible leakage—are standard idealizations used to simplify complex reactor analysis and to isolate and illustrate core physical principles, particularly the theoretical breeding potential of different fuel cycles.\n\nThe problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary definitions, data, and constraints to calculate the requested quantities ($\\eta$ for both isotopes) and to perform the subsequent neutron balance analysis for the conversion ratio. The language is objective and precise, and the setup is free from internal contradictions or factual errors. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived based on the provided information.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe first step is to calculate the reproduction factor, $\\eta$, for each fissile isotope. The reproduction factor is defined as the average number of neutrons produced per neutron absorbed in the fuel. This can be expressed as the product of the average number of neutrons emitted per fission ($\\nu$) and the probability that a neutron absorption in the fuel leads to fission.\n\nThe probability of fission per absorption is the ratio of the fission cross section ($\\sigma_f$) to the total absorption cross section ($\\sigma_a$). The total absorption cross section is the sum of the fission and radiative capture cross sections, $\\sigma_a = \\sigma_f + \\sigma_\\gamma$.\n\nThus, the formula for $\\eta$ is:\n$$\n\\eta = \\nu \\times \\frac{\\sigma_f}{\\sigma_f + \\sigma_\\gamma}\n$$\n\n**For $^{233}\\text{U}$:**\nUsing the provided data: $\\nu_{233} = 2.49$, $\\sigma_{f,233} = 531\\,\\text{b}$, and $\\sigma_{\\gamma,233} = 46\\,\\text{b}$.\nThe total absorption cross section for $^{233}\\text{U}$ is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{a,233} = \\sigma_{f,233} + \\sigma_{\\gamma,233} = 531\\,\\text{b} + 46\\,\\text{b} = 577\\,\\text{b}\n$$\nThe reproduction factor for $^{233}\\text{U}$ is:\n$$\n\\eta_{233} = 2.49 \\times \\frac{531}{577} \\approx 2.2908\n$$\n\n**For $^{235}\\text{U}$:**\nUsing the provided data: $\\nu_{235} = 2.43$, $\\sigma_{f,235} = 585\\,\\text{b}$, and $\\sigma_{\\gamma,235} = 98\\,\\text{b}$.\nThe total absorption cross section for $^{235}\\text{U}$ is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{a,235} = \\sigma_{f,235} + \\sigma_{\\gamma,235} = 585\\,\\text{b} + 98\\,\\text{b} = 683\\,\\text{b}\n$$\nThe reproduction factor for $^{235}\\text{U}$ is:\n$$\n\\eta_{235} = 2.43 \\times \\frac{585}{683} \\approx 2.0845\n$$\n\nComparing the two values, $\\eta_{233} \\approx 2.29$ is significantly higher than $\\eta_{235} \\approx 2.08$.\n\nNext, we assess the potential for a net conversion ratio above unity (i.e., breeding, where the Conversion Ratio $CR > 1$). The problem sets up a neutron balance per neutron absorbed in the fissile fuel. For each such absorption, $\\eta$ neutrons are produced. These neutrons are distributed as follows:\n- $1$ neutron is required to be absorbed in another fissile nucleus to maintain criticality.\n- $x = 0.15$ neutrons are lost to parasitic capture in non-fertile materials.\n- $L=0$ neutrons are lost to leakage (assumed negligible).\n- The remaining neutrons, $C$, are available for capture in the fertile material ($^{232}\\text{Th}$).\n\nThe neutron balance equation is:\n$$\n\\eta = 1 + x + L + C\n$$\nSubstituting the given values, $x=0.15$ and $L=0$:\n$$\n\\eta = 1 + 0.15 + C \\implies C = \\eta - 1.15\n$$\nThe Conversion Ratio ($CR$) is the rate of fertile-to-fissile conversions divided by the rate of fissile atom consumption. In this framework, this is simply the number of neutrons captured in fertile material, $C$, per fissile atom consumed (which is $1$ by definition of the balance). Therefore, $CR = C = \\eta - 1.15$.\n\nFor a net conversion ratio above unity (breeding), we must have $CR > 1$. This implies:\n$$\n\\eta - 1.15 > 1 \\implies \\eta > 2.15\n$$\n\n**Assessing $^{233}\\text{U}$:**\nWe calculated $\\eta_{233} \\approx 2.2908$. Since $2.2908 > 2.15$, a net conversion ratio above unity is theoretically achievable. The specific conversion ratio would be:\n$$\nCR_{233} = \\eta_{233} - 1.15 \\approx 2.2908 - 1.15 = 1.1408\n$$\n\n**Assessing $^{235}\\text{U}$:**\nWe calculated $\\eta_{235} \\approx 2.0845$. Since $2.0845  2.15$, a net conversion ratio above unity is not achievable under these conditions. The conversion ratio would be:\n$$\nCR_{235} = \\eta_{235} - 1.15 \\approx 2.0845 - 1.15 = 0.9345\n$$\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n- **A. In the thermal spectrum defined, $^{233}\\text{U}$ has a higher reproduction factor than $^{235}\\text{U}$. With non-fertile parasitic captures $x = 0.15$ and negligible leakage, a net conversion ratio above unity is theoretically achievable with $^{233}\\text{U}$ but not with $^{235}\\text{U}$.**\n  - Our calculation showed $\\eta_{233} \\approx 2.29$ and $\\eta_{235} \\approx 2.08$, so the first statement is correct.\n  - Our breeding analysis showed that the condition $\\eta > 2.15$ is met by $^{233}\\text{U}$ but not by $^{235}\\text{U}$. Thus, the second statement is also correct.\n  - **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B. Because $^{235}\\text{U}$ has a larger thermal fission cross section than $^{233}\\text{U}$, its reproduction factor in a thermal spectrum must be higher, implying thorium breeding is easier with $^{235}\\text{U}$.**\n  - The premise that $\\sigma_{f,235} > \\sigma_{f,233}$ ($585\\,\\text{b} > 531\\,\\text{b}$) is true. However, the conclusion that $\\eta_{235}$ must be higher is false. The reproduction factor $\\eta$ also depends on $\\nu$ and $\\sigma_{\\gamma}$. For $^{235}\\text{U}$, the lower $\\nu$ and much higher ratio of capture-to-fission ($\\sigma_{\\gamma}/\\sigma_f$) result in a lower $\\eta$ value, as demonstrated by our calculation. The reasoning is flawed and the conclusion is incorrect.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C. Even if $^{233}\\text{U}$ has a higher reproduction factor in a thermal spectrum, breeding on thorium in thermal systems is impossible regardless of parasitic capture levels, because an absorption in $^{232}\\text{Th}$ requires more than one neutron to produce $^{233}\\text{U}$.**\n  - The reasoning provided is factually incorrect. The production of $^{233}\\text{U}$ from $^{232}\\text{Th}$ is initiated by the capture of a single neutron: $^{232}\\text{Th}(n,\\gamma)^{233}\\text{Th}$, which then beta-decays to $^{233}\\text{U}$. The premise is false.\n  - Furthermore, the claim that breeding is impossible \"regardless of parasitic capture levels\" is also false. In an idealized system with zero parasitic capture ($x=0$) and zero leakage, the condition for breeding becomes $\\eta > 2$. Since $\\eta_{233} \\approx 2.29 > 2$, breeding would be possible.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. The difference between the reproduction factors of $^{233}\\text{U}$ and $^{235}\\text{U}$ is negligible in practical thermal reactors, so conversion ratio cannot exceed unity for thorium even with optimized designs.**\n  - The calculated difference is $\\eta_{233} - \\eta_{235} \\approx 2.29 - 2.08 = 0.21$. This difference of about $10\\%$ is far from negligible; it is the fundamental reason why thermal breeding is feasible with the Th-$^{233}$U cycle but not with a $^{235}$U-fueled thorium cycle. The conclusion that the conversion ratio cannot exceed unity is also incorrect for the $^{233}\\text{U}$ case.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **E. The higher reproduction factor of $^{233}\\text{U}$ implies that, after allocating $1$ neutron to sustain criticality and $x = 0.15$ neutrons to non-fertile parasitic captures, at least about $1.14$ neutrons per fissile absorption remain for capture in $^{232}\\text{Th}$, enabling net fissile production if $^{233}\\text{Pa}$ losses are controlled.**\n  - This option correctly calculates the number of neutrons available for breeding, $C = CR = \\eta_{233} - 1 - x \\approx 2.2908 - 1 - 0.15 = 1.1408$. The value \"about $1.14$\" is correct.\n  - Since this value is greater than $1$, it enables \"net fissile production\" (breeding). The mention of $^{233}\\text{Pa}$ losses is a correct acknowledgement of a practical consideration that was idealized away in the problem statement. Every part of this statement is consistent with our derivation.\n  - **Verdict: Correct.**",

This definition excludes non-fission fissile absorptions from the denominator, consistent with a conversion ratio rather than a breeding ratio.\n\nSelf-shielding is modeled by multiplicative factors $g_i^{\\gamma}$ and $g_i^{f}$ applied to the infinite dilution microscopic capture and fission cross sections, respectively, to obtain effective values $\\sigma_{i,\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\gamma} = g_i^{\\gamma} \\sigma_i^{\\gamma}$ and $\\sigma_{i,\\mathrm{eff}}^{f} = g_i^{f} \\sigma_i^{f}$.\n\nYou will implement the computation of $CR$ for two cross-section sets:\n- Unshielded set: $g_i^{\\gamma} = 1$ and $g_i^{f} = 1$ for all nuclides.\n- Shielded set: nuclide-specific $g_i^{\\gamma}$ and $g_i^{f}$ given below.\n\nAssume a homogeneous, infinite medium and constant one-group flux. To isolate the effect of self-shielding on $CR$, keep all other parameters identical between the two sets.\n\nUse the following nuclides and one-group infinite dilution microscopic cross sections (barns) at thermal energy:\n- Uranium-235 ($^{235}\\text{U}$): $\\sigma^{f} = 585$, $\\sigma^{\\gamma} = 98$.\n- Uranium-238 ($^{238}\\text{U}$): $\\sigma^{f} = 0.02$, $\\sigma^{\\gamma} = 2.68$.\n- Plutonium-239 ($^{239}\\text{Pu}$): $\\sigma^{f} = 742$, $\\sigma^{\\gamma} = 270$.\n- Plutonium-240 ($^{240}\\text{Pu}$): $\\sigma^{f} = 0.1$, $\\sigma^{\\gamma} = 290$.\n- Plutonium-241 ($^{241}\\text{Pu}$): $\\sigma^{f} = 1010$, $\\sigma^{\\gamma} = 370$.\n- Thorium-232 ($^{232}\\text{Th}$): $\\sigma^{f} = 0.002$, $\\sigma^{\\gamma} = 7.4$.\n- Uranium-233 ($^{233}\\text{U}$): $\\sigma^{f} = 530$, $\\sigma^{\\gamma} = 45$.\n\nUse the following self-shielding factors for the shielded set:\n- $^{238}\\text{U}$: $g^{\\gamma} = 0.6$, $g^{f} = 1.0$.\n- $^{232}\\text{Th}$: $g^{\\gamma} = 0.7$, $g^{f} = 1.0$.\n- $^{240}\\text{Pu}$: $g^{\\gamma} = 0.85$, $g^{f} = 0.95$.\n- $^{235}\\text{U}$: $g^{\\gamma} = 0.92$, $g^{f} = 0.98$.\n- $^{239}\\text{Pu}$: $g^{\\gamma} = 0.88$, $g^{f} = 0.97$.\n- $^{241}\\text{Pu}$: $g^{\\gamma} = 0.90$, $g^{f} = 0.98$.\n- $^{233}\\text{U}$: $g^{\\gamma} = 0.93$, $g^{f} = 0.98$.\n\nUse the following yields for fertile-to-fissile production per capture (unitless probabilities):\n- $^{238}\\text{U} \\rightarrow ^{239}\\text{Pu}$: $y = 0.90$.\n- $^{232}\\text{Th} \\rightarrow ^{233}\\text{U}$: $y = 0.95$.\n- $^{240}\\text{Pu} \\rightarrow ^{241}\\text{Pu}$: $y = 0.75$.\n\nAssume a constant one-group neutron flux $\\Phi = 10^{14}\\ n \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^{-2} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.

The total heavy-metal number density is $N_{\\mathrm{HM}} = 9.6 \\times 10^{22}$:\n1. Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) $\\text{UO}_2$-like mixture: $^{235}\\text{U}$ fraction $0.045$, $^{238}\\text{U}$ fraction $0.955$; i.e., $N(^{235}\\text{U}) = 0.045 N_{\\mathrm{HM}}$, $N(^{238}\\text{U}) = 0.955 N_{\\mathrm{HM}}$.\n2.

All microscopic cross sections must be converted from barns to square centimeters using $10^{-24}$, and the flux must be used in $n \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^{-2} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The conversion ratio $CR$ is dimensionless; report each $CR$ as a decimal rounded to six decimal places.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the order $[CR_{\\mathrm{unshielded},1}, CR_{\\mathrm{shielded},1}, CR_{\\mathrm{unshielded},2}, CR_{\\mathrm{shielded},2}, CR_{\\mathrm{unshielded},3}, CR_{\\mathrm{shielded},3}, CR_{\\mathrm{unshielded},4}, CR_{\\mathrm{shielded},4}]$, where the index denotes the test case number from $1$ to $4$.",
            "solution": "The problem has been validated and found to be scientifically sound, well-posed, and complete. It describes a standard numerical experiment in reactor physics to investigate the impact of resonance self-shielding on the conversion ratio of various fuel types.\n\nThe core task is to compute the conversion ratio, $CR$, for several fuel compositions, under two distinct assumptions for the microscopic cross sections: an unshielded (infinite dilution) set and a shielded (effective) set. The conversion ratio is defined as the ratio of the production rate of fissile nuclides to the destruction rate of fissile nuclides.\n\nThe production rate, $P$, is the rate at which fertile nuclides capture neutrons to become fissile nuclides. It is given by the sum of reaction rates over all relevant fertile nuclides, weighted by the yield of the conversion process. The fertile nuclides specified are Uranium-238 ($^{238}\\text{U}$), Thorium-232 ($^{232}\\text{Th}$), and Plutonium-240 ($^{240}\\text{Pu}$). The formula for the total production rate is:\n$$ P = \\sum_{i \\in \\{$^{238}\\text{U}, ^{232}\\text{Th}, ^{240}\\text{Pu}$\\}} \\Phi \\cdot N_i \\cdot \\sigma_{i,\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\gamma} \\cdot y_i $$\nwhere $\\Phi$ is the neutron flux, $N_i$ is the number density of fertile nuclide $i$, $\\sigma_{i,\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\gamma}$ is its effective microscopic capture cross section, and $y_i$ is the probability that a capture in nuclide $i$ yields a fissile nuclide.\n\nThe destruction rate, $D$, is the rate at which fissile nuclides are consumed via fission. The problem specifies the fissile nuclides as Uranium-235 ($^{235}\\text{U}$), Plutonium-239 ($^{239}\\text{Pu}$), Uranium-233 ($^{233}\\text{U}$), and Plutonium-241 ($^{241}\\text{Pu}$). The formula for the total destruction rate is:\n$$ D = \\sum_{j \\in \\{$^{235}\\text{U}, ^{239}\\text{Pu}, ^{233}\\text{U}, ^{241}\\text{Pu}$\\}} \\Phi \\cdot N_j \\cdot \\sigma_{j,\\mathrm{eff}}^{f} $$\nwhere $N_j$ is the number density of fissile nuclide $j$ and $\\sigma_{j,\\mathrm{eff}}^{f}$ is its effective microscopic fission cross section.\n\nThe conversion ratio, $CR$, is therefore:\n$$ CR = \\frac{P}{D} = \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in \\text{fertile}} \\Phi N_i \\sigma_{i,\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\gamma} y_i}{\\sum_{j \\in \\text{fissile}} \\Phi N_j \\sigma_{j,\\mathrm{eff}}^{f}} $$\nA crucial observation is that the neutron flux, $\\Phi$, appears as a common factor in both the numerator and the denominator. It can therefore be canceled out, simplifying the calculation:\n$$ CR = \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in \\text{fertile}} N_i \\sigma_{i,\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\gamma} y_i}{\\sum_{j \\in \\text{fissile}} N_j \\sigma_{j,\\mathrm{eff}}^{f}} $$\nSimilarly, the number density of each nuclide $k$ is given as a fraction $f_k$ of the total heavy-metal number density $N_{\\mathrm{HM}}$, i.e., $N_k = f_k N_{\\mathrm{HM}}$. Substituting this into the simplified $CR$ equation allows for the cancellation of $N_{\\mathrm{HM}}$ as well:\n$$ CR = \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in \\text{fertile}} (f_i N_{\\mathrm{HM}}) \\sigma_{i,\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\gamma} y_i}{\\sum_{j \\in \\text{fissile}} (f_j N_{\\mathrm{HM}}) \\sigma_{j,\\mathrm{eff}}^{f}} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{HM}} \\sum_{i \\in \\text{fertile}} f_i \\sigma_{i,\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\gamma} y_i}{N_{\\mathrm{HM}} \\sum_{j \\in \\text{fissile}} f_j \\sigma_{j,\\mathrm{eff}}^{f}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in \\text{fertile}} f_i \\sigma_{i,\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\gamma} y_i}{\\sum_{j \\in \\text{fissile}} f_j \\sigma_{j,\\mathrm{eff}}^{f}} $$\nThis means the explicit values for $\\Phi = 10^{14}\\ n \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^{-2} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $N_{\\mathrm{HM}} = 9.6 \\times 10^{22}\\ \\mathrm{atoms}/\\mathrm{cm}^3$ are not required for the final calculation of the dimensionless ratio $CR$. The conversion factor from barns to $\\mathrm{cm}^2$ ($1\\ \\mathrm{barn} = 10^{-24}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^2$) would also cancel, so cross sections can be used directly in units of barns, which simplifies implementation.\n\nThe effect of self-shielding is introduced through multiplicative factors, $g_i^{\\gamma}$ and $g_i^{f}$, which relate the effective cross sections to the infinite dilution cross sections ($\\sigma_i^{\\gamma}$, $\\sigma_i^{f}$):\n$$ \\sigma_{i,\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\gamma} = g_i^{\\gamma} \\sigma_i^{\\gamma} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sigma_{i,\\mathrm{eff}}^{f} = g_i^{f} \\sigma_i^{f} $$\nThe experiment requires two calculations for each fuel composition:\n1.  **Unshielded Case ($CR_{\\mathrm{unshielded}}$)**: All self-shielding factors are set to unity, i.e., $g_i^{\\gamma} = 1$ and $g_i^{f} = 1$ for all nuclides. This corresponds to using the infinite dilution cross sections directly.\n2.  **Shielded Case ($CR_{\\mathrm{shielded}}$)**: The provided nuclide-specific $g$-factors are applied to calculate the effective cross sections.\n\nThe procedure for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Identify the fissile and fertile nuclides present in the specified fuel composition.\n2.  For the unshielded case, calculate the numerator by summing $f_i \\sigma_i^{\\gamma} y_i$ over the present fertile nuclides and the denominator by summing $f_j \\sigma_j^{f}$ over the present fissile nuclides. Compute their ratio.\n3.  For the shielded case, calculate the numerator by summing $f_i (g_i^{\\gamma} \\sigma_i^{\\gamma}) y_i$ over the present fertile nuclides and the denominator by summing $f_j (g_j^{f} \\sigma_j^{f})$ over the present fissile nuclides. Compute their ratio.\n4.  Round the final $CR$ values to six decimal places as required.\n\nThis process is repeated for all four test cases, and the results are aggregated into a single list for output. The difference between $CR_{\\mathrm{unshielded}}$ and $CR_{\\mathrm{shielded}}$ for each fuel mix will quantify the impact of resonance self-shielding on the fuel's conversion potential within this one-group model.",
