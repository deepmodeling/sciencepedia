The limit simplifies to:\n$$Y_{\\infty} = \\frac{2A}{r \\alpha^2} \\lim_{T \\to \\infty} \\left( \\alpha - \\frac{1}{T} \\right) = \\frac{2A}{r \\alpha^2} (\\alpha) = \\frac{2A}{r \\alpha}$$\nFrom this result, we can express the amplitude $A$ in terms of $Y_{\\infty}$:\n$$A = \\frac{r \\alpha Y_{\\infty}}{2}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $A$ back into our equation for $Y(T)$:\n$$Y(T) = \\frac{2 \\left(\\frac{r \\alpha Y_{\\infty}}{2}\\right)}{r \\alpha^2 T} (\\alpha T - 1 + \\exp(-\\alpha T))$$\n$$Y(T) = \\frac{r \\alpha Y_{\\infty}}{r \\alpha^2 T} (\\alpha T - 1 + \\exp(-\\alpha T)) = \\frac{Y_{\\infty}}{\\alpha T} (\\alpha T - 1 + \\exp(-\\alpha T))$$\nThis can be rewritten in the standard form:\n$$Y(T) = Y_{\\infty} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1 - \\exp(-\\alpha T)}{\\alpha T} \\right)$$\n\n**Task 3: Derive the small-gate expansion of $Y(T)$ for $\\alpha T \\ll 1$.**\n\nWe need to find the leading-order term in $T$ for $Y(T)$ in the limit $\\alpha T \\to 0$. This requires a Taylor series expansion of the function $\\exp(-\\alpha T)$ around $T = 0$.\nLet $x = \\alpha T$. The expansion of $\\exp(-x)$ for small $x$ is:\n$$\\exp(-x) = 1 - x + \\frac{x^2}{2!} - \\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\mathcal{O}(x^4)$$\nSubstitute this into the expression for $Y(T)$:\n$$Y(T) = Y_{\\infty} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1 - \\left( 1 - \\alpha T + \\frac{(\\alpha T)^2}{2} - \\frac{(\\alpha T)^3}{6} + \\dots \\right)}{\\alpha T} \\right)$$\n$$Y(T) = Y_{\\infty} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\alpha T - \\frac{(\\alpha T)^2}{2} + \\frac{(\\alpha T)^3}{6} - \\dots}{\\alpha T} \\right)$$\n$$Y(T) = Y_{\\infty} \\left( 1 - \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\alpha T}{2} + \\frac{(\\alpha T)^2}{6} - \\dots \\right) \\right)$$\n$$Y(T) = Y_{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha T}{2} - \\frac{(\\alpha T)^2}{6} + \\dots \\right)$$\nThe leading-order term is the term with the lowest power of $T$. In this expansion, the leading-order term is:\n$$Y(T)_{\\text{leading}} = Y_{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha T}{2} \\right) = \\frac{Y_{\\infty} \\alpha T}{2}$$\n\n**Interpretation of the linear scaling:**\nThe Feynman $Y$-statistic measures the excess variance in neutron counts compared to a purely random (Poisson) process. This excess variance arises from the correlation between neutrons born in the same fission chain. For a very short time gate ($T \\ll 1/\\alpha$), the time gate is much shorter than the characteristic lifetime of a neutron chain ($1/\\alpha$). In this limit, the probability of detecting two correlated neutrons (e.g., a \"parent\" and a \"descendant\" from the same fission event) within the same time gate is small but increases with the gate's duration. The total number of correlated pairs that can be captured scales as the integral of the auto-covariance function, which grows as $T^2$ for small $T$. Since the mean number of counts $\\mathbb{E}[N(T)]$ grows linearly with $T$, the ratio of the correlated variance component to the mean count, which is what $Y(T)$ represents, scales linearly with $T$. Thus, the linear scaling $Y(T) \\propto T$ in the short-gate limit reflects the fact that we are in a regime where increasing the gate length provides a linearly increasing chance to capture correlated neutron pairs relative to the total number of detections.",

I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of $Y(T)$ starting from first principles for a specific physical scenario.\n\n**1. Modeling the Neutron Source and Detection**\n\nThe external neutron source has a constant intensity $S$. This physical situation is modeled as a homogeneous Poisson process. The number of neutrons emitted by the source in a time interval of duration $T$, denoted as $M(T)$, follows a Poisson distribution with parameter $\\lambda_M = S T$. The probability mass function is:\n$$ P(M(T) = k) = \\frac{(ST)^k}{k!} \\exp(-ST) $$\nFor a Poisson distribution, the mean and variance are equal to its parameter:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[M(T)] = S T $$\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(M(T)) = S T $$\n\nEach of the $M(T)$ source neutrons is detected independently with a constant probability $\\varepsilon$. This process is known as thinning. The number of detected neutrons, $N(T)$, given that $M(T) = m$ source neutrons were emitted, follows a binomial distribution:\n$$ N(T) | (M(T)=m) \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(m, \\varepsilon) $$\n\n**2. Distribution of Detected Counts using Probability Generating Functions (PGFs)**\n\nAs requested, we use the PGF to find the unconditional distribution of the detected counts $N(T)$. The PGF of a random variable $X$ is defined as $G_X(z) = \\mathbb{E}[z^X]$.\n\nThe PGF of the source count distribution $M(T) \\sim \\mathrm{Pois}(ST)$ is:\n$$ G_M(z) = \\exp(ST(z-1)) $$\n\nThe PGF of the binomial distribution for the number of successes in one trial with probability $\\varepsilon$ (i.e., whether a single neutron is detected) is:\n$$ G_{det}(z) = (1-\\varepsilon) \\cdot z^0 + \\varepsilon \\cdot z^1 = 1 - \\varepsilon + \\varepsilon z $$\n\nThe PGF of the final count distribution $N(T)$ is obtained by compounding the PGF of the source with the PGF for the detection of a single neutron. This is equivalent to evaluating the source PGF at the detection PGF:\n$$ G_N(z) = G_M(G_{det}(z)) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the PGFs:\n$$ G_N(z) = \\exp \\left( ST \\left( (1 - \\varepsilon + \\varepsilon z) - 1 \\right) \\right) $$\n$$ G_N(z) = \\exp \\left( ST (\\varepsilon z - \\varepsilon) \\right) $$\n$$ G_N(z) = \\exp \\left( S\\varepsilon T (z-1) \\right) $$\n\nThis is the PGF of a Poisson distribution with parameter $\\lambda_N = S\\varepsilon T$. Therefore, the number of detected counts $N(T)$ also follows a Poisson distribution, $N(T) \\sim \\mathrm{Pois}(S\\varepsilon T)$. This is a general result: the thinning of a Poisson process yields another Poisson process.\n\n**3. Calculation of Y(T)**\n\nThe function $Y(T)$ is defined as $Y(T) = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(N(T))}{\\mathbb{E}[N(T)]} - 1$. For a random variable $X \\sim \\mathrm{Pois}(\\lambda)$, its mean and variance are both equal to $\\lambda$. In our case, $N(T) \\sim \\mathrm{Pois}(S\\varepsilon T)$, so:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[N(T)] = S \\varepsilon T $$\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(N(T)) = S \\varepsilon T $$\n\nSubstituting these into the definition of $Y(T)$:\n$$ Y(T) = \\frac{S\\varepsilon T}{S\\varepsilon T} - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0 $$\nThe closed-form expression for $Y(T)$ under the given conditions is exactly zero for all $T  0$.\n\n**4. Comparison with a Weakly Multiplying Case**\n\nIn a general subcritical system where fission occurs (a multiplying medium), the Feynman-alpha function is given by the one-point kinetics model:\n$$ Y(T) = Y_\\infty \\left( 1 - \\frac{1 - e^{-\\alpha T}}{\\alpha T} \\right) $$\nHere, $\\alpha  0$ is the prompt neutron decay constant (Rossi-alpha), which characterizes the time scale of correlated fission chains. The asymptotic value $Y_\\infty$ is positive and depends on the Diven factor $D = \\frac{\\langle \\nu(\\nu-1) \\rangle}{\\langle \\nu \\rangle^2}$ (where $\\nu$ is the number of neutrons per fission), the detector efficiency $\\varepsilon$, and the system reactivity $\\rho$:\n$Y_\\infty = \\frac{\\varepsilon D}{(-\\rho)^2}$.\nThe term $\\langle \\nu(\\nu-1) \\rangle$ quantifies the variance introduced by the stochastic nature of the number of neutrons produced in a fission event. This variance is the source of the correlations that make $Y(T)  0$.\n\nThe qualitative shape of the $Y(T)$ versus $T$ curve for a multiplying system is as follows:\n- For $T \\rightarrow 0$, $Y(T) \\approx Y_\\infty \\frac{\\alpha T}{2}$. The curve starts at $Y(0)=0$ and rises linearly.\n- For $T \\rightarrow \\infty$, $Y(T) \\rightarrow Y_\\infty$. The curve saturates at a positive constant value.\n- The curve rises monotonically from $0$ to $Y_\\infty$, with the \"knee\" of the curve located at a time scale $T \\sim 1/\\alpha$.\n\nThe problem statement specifies that the \"mean number of progeny per neutron is effectively zero\". This implies that there is no fission, meaning $\\nu=0$ for all interactions. Consequently, the Diven factor $D=0$, which leads to $Y_\\infty=0$. The general formula correctly collapses to $Y(T)=0$.\n\nThe **qualitative change** is profound:\n- In the **weakly multiplying case**, the $Y(T)$ curve rises from zero and saturates at a positive value. This shape carries information about the system's dynamics, specifically the prompt decay constant $\\alpha$. The non-zero value reflects the presence of correlated counts arising from fission chains, which causes the count variance to be larger than the mean (super-Poissonian statistics).\n- In the **non-multiplying case** of this problem, the $Y(T)$ curve is a flat line identically equal to zero for all $T$. This signifies a complete absence of correlations between detected neutrons. Since every detected neutron originates independently from the source and is detected independently, the resulting count statistics are purely Poissonian. For a Poisson process, the variance-to-mean ratio is always $1$, and thus $Y(T)$ is always $0$. The characteristic rising and saturating shape, which is the cornerstone of the Feynman-alpha measurement technique, is completely absent.",

The variance is given by Campbell's theorem for counting processes:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(N_T) = \\lambda T + 2\\int_{0}^{T} (T-\\tau)\\, C(\\tau)\\, d\\tau.\n$$\nSubstituting these into the definition of $Y(T)$ yields\n$$\nY(T) = \\frac{\\left( \\lambda T + 2\\int_{0}^{T} (T-\\tau)\\, C(\\tau)\\, d\\tau \\right) - \\lambda T}{\\lambda T} = \\frac{2}{\\lambda T} \\int_{0}^{T} (T-\\tau)\\, C(\\tau)\\, d\\tau.\n$$\nThe problem specifies an exponential autocovariance model $C(\\tau) = B \\exp(-\\alpha |\\tau|)$. Since the integral is over $\\tau \\in [0, T]$, we can write $|\\tau| = \\tau$. The integral term becomes\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T} (T-\\tau)\\, B \\exp(-\\alpha \\tau)\\, d\\tau = B \\left( T \\int_{0}^{T} \\exp(-\\alpha \\tau)\\, d\\tau - \\int_{0}^{T} \\tau \\exp(-\\alpha \\tau)\\, d\\tau \\right).\n$$\nThe first integral is straightforward:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T} \\exp(-\\alpha \\tau)\\, d\\tau = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\exp(-\\alpha \\tau) \\right]_{0}^{T} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha}(1 - \\exp(-\\alpha T)).\n$$\nThe second integral is solved using integration by parts, with $u=\\tau$ and $dv = \\exp(-\\alpha \\tau) d\\tau$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T} \\tau \\exp(-\\alpha \\tau)\\, d\\tau = \\left[ -\\frac{\\tau}{\\alpha}\\exp(-\\alpha \\tau) \\right]_{0}^{T} - \\int_{0}^{T} \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\right) \\exp(-\\alpha \\tau)\\, d\\tau = -\\frac{T}{\\alpha}\\exp(-\\alpha T) + \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\int_{0}^{T} \\exp(-\\alpha \\tau)\\, d\\tau\n$$\n$$\n= -\\frac{T}{\\alpha}\\exp(-\\alpha T) + \\frac{1}{\\alpha^2}(1 - \\exp(-\\alpha T)).\n$$\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for the main integral:\n$$\nB \\left[ T \\frac{1}{\\alpha}(1 - \\exp(-\\alpha T)) - \\left( -\\frac{T}{\\alpha}\\exp(-\\alpha T) + \\frac{1}{\\alpha^2}(1 - \\exp(-\\alpha T)) \\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n= B \\left[ \\frac{T}{\\alpha} - \\frac{T}{\\alpha}\\exp(-\\alpha T) + \\frac{T}{\\alpha}\\exp(-\\alpha T) - \\frac{1}{\\alpha^2} + \\frac{1}{\\alpha^2}\\exp(-\\alpha T) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{B}{\\alpha^2} (\\alpha T - 1 + \\exp(-\\alpha T)).\n$$\nNow, we substitute this into the expression for $Y(T)$:\n$$\nY(T) = \\frac{2}{\\lambda T} \\frac{B}{\\alpha^2} (\\alpha T - 1 + \\exp(-\\alpha T)).\n$$\nThe problem defines $Y_{\\infty}$ as the limit of $Y(T)$ as $T \\to \\infty$. To find this limit, we can first rearrange the expression for $Y(T)$:\n$$\nY(T) = \\frac{2B}{\\lambda \\alpha} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha T - 1 + \\exp(-\\alpha T)}{\\alpha T} \\right) = \\frac{2B}{\\lambda \\alpha} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1 - \\exp(-\\alpha T)}{\\alpha T} \\right).\n$$\nAs $T \\to \\infty$, the term $\\frac{1 - \\exp(-\\alpha T)}{\\alpha T}$ goes to $0$. Thus,\n$$\nY_{\\infty} = \\lim_{T \\to \\infty} Y(T) = \\frac{2B}{\\lambda \\alpha}.\n$$\nUsing this relationship, we can express $Y(T)$ in terms of $Y_{\\infty}$:\n$$\nY(T; \\alpha) = Y_{\\infty} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1 - \\exp(-\\alpha T)}{\\alpha T} \\right).\n$$\n\nPart 2: Derivation of the Cramér–Rao Lower Bound (CRLB).\n\nThe CRLB for an unbiased estimator $\\hat{\\alpha}$ of a parameter $\\alpha$ is given by the inverse of the Fisher information, $\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\alpha}) \\ge [I(\\alpha)]^{-1}$.\nThe measurements $\\{\\widehat{Y}_k(T_k)\\}_{k=1}^{K}$ are independent Gaussian random variables with mean $Y(T_k; \\alpha)$ and variance $\\sigma_k^2/M_k$. The total Fisher information is the sum of the information from each measurement:\n$$\nI(\\alpha) = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} I_k(\\alpha) = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\frac{1}{\\sigma_k^2/M_k} \\left( \\frac{\\partial Y(T_k; \\alpha)}{\\partial \\alpha} \\right)^2 = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\frac{M_k}{\\sigma_k^2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial Y(T_k; \\alpha)}{\\partial \\alpha} \\right)^2.\n$$\nWe need to compute the partial derivative of $Y(T; \\alpha)$ with respect to $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial Y(T; \\alpha)}{\\partial \\alpha} = Y_{\\infty} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\alpha} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1 - \\exp(-\\alpha T)}{\\alpha T} \\right) = - \\frac{Y_{\\infty}}{T} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\alpha} \\left( \\frac{1 - \\exp(-\\alpha T)}{\\alpha} \\right).\n$$\nUsing the quotient rule for the term in the parenthesis:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\alpha} \\left( \\frac{1 - \\exp(-\\alpha T)}{\\alpha} \\right) = \\frac{(\\alpha)(T\\exp(-\\alpha T)) - (1 - \\exp(-\\alpha T))(1)}{\\alpha^2} = \\frac{\\alpha T \\exp(-\\alpha T) - 1 + \\exp(-\\alpha T)}{\\alpha^2}.\n$$\nSubstituting this back, we get the full derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial Y(T; \\alpha)}{\\partial \\alpha} = - \\frac{Y_{\\infty}}{T} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha T \\exp(-\\alpha T) - 1 + \\exp(-\\alpha T)}{\\alpha^2} \\right) = \\frac{Y_{\\infty}}{\\alpha^2 T} \\left( 1 - \\exp(-\\alpha T) - \\alpha T \\exp(-\\alpha T) \\right).\n$$\nThis can be written more compactly as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial Y(T; \\alpha)}{\\partial \\alpha} = \\frac{Y_{\\infty}}{\\alpha^2 T} \\left( 1 - (1+\\alpha T)\\exp(-\\alpha T) \\right).\n$$\nSquaring this derivative gives:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial Y(T; \\alpha)}{\\partial \\alpha} \\right)^2 = \\frac{Y_{\\infty}^2}{\\alpha^4 T^2} \\left( 1 - (1+\\alpha T)\\exp(-\\alpha T) \\right)^2.\n$$\nNow we can write the Fisher information by substituting this expression for each gate duration $T_k$:\n$$\nI(\\alpha) = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\frac{M_k}{\\sigma_k^2} \\frac{Y_{\\infty}^2}{\\alpha^4 T_k^2} \\left( 1 - (1+\\alpha T_k)\\exp(-\\alpha T_k) \\right)^2.\n$$\nThe CRLB is the reciprocal of the Fisher information. We can factor out the terms not involved in the summation:\n$$\n\\operatorname{CRLB}(\\alpha) = [I(\\alpha)]^{-1} = \\frac{\\alpha^4}{Y_{\\infty}^2} \\left[ \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\frac{M_k}{\\sigma_k^2 T_k^2} \\left( 1 - (1+\\alpha T_k)\\exp(-\\alpha T_k) \\right)^2 \\right]^{-1}.\n$$\n\nPart 3: Qualitative Analysis.\n\nThe CRLB provides the minimum achievable variance for any unbiased estimator of $\\alpha$. To minimize the CRLB, one must maximize the Fisher information $I(\\alpha)$. The Fisher information is a sum of contributions from each measurement setup $(T_k, M_k, \\sigma_k^2)$. Each contribution $I_k(\\alpha)$ is proportional to the prefactor $M_k/\\sigma_k^2$, which quantifies the quality of the measurement $\\widehat{Y}_k$, and the sensitivity term $(\\partial Y(T_k; \\alpha)/\\partial \\alpha)^2$, which quantifies how much the underlying physical model changes with $\\alpha$ for a given gate time $T_k$. The choice of gate durations $\\{T_k\\}$ impacts the CRLB through this sensitivity term. Let $S(T, \\alpha) = |\\partial Y(T; \\alpha)/\\partial \\alpha|$.\n\nWe analyze the asymptotic behavior of the sensitivity $S(T, \\alpha)$ as a function of $T$. Let $x = \\alpha T$.\n$$\nS(T, \\alpha) = \\frac{Y_{\\infty}}{\\alpha x} \\left| 1 - (1+x)\\exp(-x) \\right|.\n$$\nSince $\\exp(x)  1+x$ for $x0$, the term inside the absolute value is always positive.\n\nFor small gate durations ($T \\to 0$, so $x \\to 0$): We use the Taylor expansion $\\exp(-x) \\approx 1 - x + \\frac{x^2}{2} - \\frac{x^3}{6}$.\n$$\n1 - (1+x)\\left(1 - x + \\frac{x^2}{2} - \\dots \\right) = 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\dots \\right) \\approx \\frac{x^2}{2}.\n$$\nThe sensitivity becomes\n$$\nS(T, \\alpha) \\approx \\frac{Y_{\\infty}}{\\alpha x} \\left( \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right) = \\frac{Y_{\\infty} x}{2\\alpha} = \\frac{Y_{\\infty} (\\alpha T)}{2\\alpha} = \\frac{Y_{\\infty}}{2}T.\n$$\nFor very short gates ($T \\ll 1/\\alpha$), the sensitivity to $\\alpha$ is small and grows linearly with $T$. The system has not evolved long enough for its characteristic decay time to be accurately measured.\n\nFor large gate durations ($T \\to \\infty$, so $x \\to \\infty$): The term $(1+x)\\exp(-x)$ decays to zero.\n$$\nS(T, \\alpha) \\approx \\frac{Y_{\\infty}}{\\alpha x} (1) = \\frac{Y_{\\infty}}{\\alpha (\\alpha T)} = \\frac{Y_{\\infty}}{\\alpha^2 T}.\n$$\nFor very long gates ($T \\gg 1/\\alpha$), the sensitivity is also small and decays as $1/T$. The measurement $Y(T)$ saturates towards $Y_{\\infty}$, which is independent of $\\alpha$, so information about the transient decay is lost.\n\nGiven that the sensitivity is low for both very small and very large $T$, there must be an optimal gate duration $T_{opt}$ that maximizes the sensitivity and thus provides the most information about $\\alpha$. To find this optimum, we set the derivative of the sensitivity term with respect to $T$ (or $x$) to zero. This leads to the transcendental equation $e^x = 1+x+x^2$, where $x = \\alpha T$. The non-trivial solution is $x \\approx 1.793$.\nTherefore, the preferable order of magnitude for the gate time $T$ to minimize the CRLB is the one that makes $\\alpha T$ close to this optimal value, i.e., $T \\approx 1.793/\\alpha$. This confirms that the measurement is most sensitive to the decay constant $\\alpha$ when the gate time is of the same order of magnitude as the characteristic time scale of the process, $1/\\alpha$. A well-designed experiment would use gate durations $\\{T_k\\}$ clustered around this optimal value.",
