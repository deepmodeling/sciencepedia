            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained, thus meeting the criteria for a valid problem. The use of a \"uniform neutron flux $\\phi_{0}$\" in a finite-sized reactor is a standard idealization in the context of introductory modal analysis, where $\\phi_{0}$ represents a characteristic flux level for linearization. The problem provides pre-computed modal coefficients, which bypasses any ambiguities arising from this simplification and allows for a direct analysis of the system's dynamics.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the characteristic equation for small-amplitude xenon-induced power oscillations and the calculation of the oscillation frequency. The physical system is described by three coupled partial differential equations for the neutron flux $\\phi(\\mathbf{r},t)$, iodine-135 concentration $N_{I}(\\mathbf{r},t)$, and xenon-135 concentration $N_{X}(\\mathbf{r},t)$.\n\nThe analysis proceeds by linearizing these equations around the steady state $(\\phi_{0}, N_{I0}, N_{X0})$ and introducing small perturbations $\\delta\\phi$, $\\delta N_I$, and $\\delta N_X$.

Projecting the linearized equations onto this mode yields a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the amplitudes. The problem instructs to use a quasi-steady approximation for the iodine dynamics, which is justified because the iodine decay half-life ($\\approx 6.6$ hours) is much longer than the typical period of xenon oscillations ($\\approx 20-30$ hours) and the response time of the iodine concentration is slow. Setting the time derivative of the iodine perturbation amplitude to zero, $\\frac{di}{dt} \\approx 0$, in its linearized ODE, we can express $i(t)$ algebraically in terms of $a(t)$.\n\nThis procedure results in a coupled $2 \\times 2$ linear system of first-order ODEs for the neutron flux amplitude $a(t)$ and the xenon amplitude $x(t)$.

            "solution": "The user-provided problem is assessed as **valid**. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of nuclear reactor physics, specifically the modeling of xenon-induced spatial power oscillations. The problem is well-posed, self-contained, and provides all necessary data and equations to arrive at a unique, meaningful solution. The language is objective and the parameters are physically plausible.\n\nThe task is to determine the stability of antisymmetric xenon-iodine oscillations in a simplified one-dimensional, two-node reactor model. This is achieved by computing the dominant eigenvalue of the linearized system dynamics matrix, $\\mathbf{A}$. The real part of this eigenvalue, $\\operatorname{Re}(\\lambda_\\mathrm{dom})$, represents the growth rate of the oscillation, while the absolute value of its imaginary part, $|\\operatorname{Im}(\\lambda_\\mathrm{dom})|$, gives the angular frequency. A positive growth rate indicates an unstable system, where perturbations grow exponentially. A negative growth rate indicates a stable system, where perturbations are damped.\n\nThe solution proceeds via the following steps for each test case:\n\n1.  **Calculate Steady-State Parameters**: The parameters $m$ and $X_0$ are properties of the homogeneous steady state and are independent of the nodal discretization parameters $h$ and $D$. They are calculated first using the provided fixed physical constants. The parameter $m$ is found by solving the self-consistent equation:\n    $$\n    m = \\frac{\\Sigma_a}{1 - \\dfrac{\\kappa_{xe} y c}{\\lambda_X + \\sigma_X c}}\n    $$\n    Once $m$ is known, the steady-state xenon-$135$ concentration, $X_0$, is calculated as:\n    $$\n    X_0 = \\frac{y \\, m \\, c}{\\lambda_X + \\sigma_X c}\n    $$\n    The fixed parameters are given as:\n    -   Macroscopic absorption cross-section, $\\Sigma_a = 0.1$ cm$^{-1}$\n    -   Xenon absorption effectiveness, $\\kappa_{xe} = 1.0\\times 10^{-6}$ cm$^{-1}$ per unit concentration\n    -   Iodine-$135$ fission yield, $y = 0.06$\n    -   Iodine-$135$ decay constant, $\\lambda_I = \\ln(2)/(6.57\\times 3600)$ s$^{-1} \\approx 2.93 \\times 10^{-5}$ s$^{-1}$\n    -   Xenon-$135$ decay constant, $\\lambda_X = \\ln(2)/(9.14\\times 3600)$ s$^{-1} \\approx 2.11 \\times 10^{-5}$ s$^{-1}$\n    -   Xenon-$135$ removal coefficient, $\\sigma_X = 3.0\\times 10^{-5}$ s$^{-1}$\n    -   Normalized steady-state flux, $c = 1.0$\n\n2.  **Calculate Flux Sensitivity**: For each test case defined by a specific node width $h$ and diffusion coefficient $D$, the flux-xenon sensitivity factor, $S_x$, is calculated. This factor quantifies the change in local flux due to a change in local xenon concentration and is a key parameter determining the strength of the spatial feedback.\n    $$\n    S_x = \\frac{\\kappa_{xe} \\, c \\, h^2}{2D}\n    $$\n\n3.  **Construct the Dynamics Matrix $\\mathbf{A}$**: The $2\\times 2$ matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ that governs the linearized dynamics of the iodine and xenon concentration perturbations is constructed. Its elements depend on both the steady-state parameters and the sensitivity factor $S_x$.\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{A} =\n    \\begin{bmatrix}\n    A_{11} & A_{12} \\\\\n    A_{21} & A_{22}\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    =\n    \\begin{bmatrix}\n    -\\lambda_I & - y \\, m \\, S_x \\\\\n    \\lambda_I & -\\lambda_X - \\sigma_X c + \\sigma_X X_0 S_x\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    $$\n\n4.  **Compute Eigenvalues**: The eigenvalues of the matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ are computed. Since $\\mathbf{A}$ is a $2\\times 2$ real matrix, it will have two eigenvalues. These eigenvalues can be either two real numbers or a complex conjugate pair.\n\n5.  **Identify the Dominant Eigenvalue**: The dominant eigenvalue, $\\lambda_\\mathrm{dom}$, is defined as the eigenvalue with the algebraically largest real part. This eigenvalue determines the long-term stability of the system.\n    $$\n    \\lambda_\\mathrm{dom} = \\max_{\\lambda_j \\in \\text{eig}(\\mathbf{A})} \\{\\operatorname{Re}(\\lambda_j)\\}\n    $$\n\n6.  **Extract Results**: The growth rate is extracted as the real part of $\\lambda_\\mathrm{dom}$, and the angular frequency is extracted as the absolute value of the imaginary part of $\\lambda_\\mathrm{dom}$. This process is repeated for each of the three test cases, and the results are collected.\n\nThe implementation will use the `numpy` library in `Python` for numerical calculations, particularly for finding the eigenvalues of the matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ using `numpy.linalg.eigvals`.",
