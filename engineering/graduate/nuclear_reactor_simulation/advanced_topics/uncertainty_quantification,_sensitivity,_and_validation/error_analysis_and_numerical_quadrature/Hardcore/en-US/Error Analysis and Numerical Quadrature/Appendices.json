In this specific case, the approximate flux function $\\phi(\\xi)$ dips into a non-physical negative region around the center of the element. We have $\\phi(0) = -0.6\\,\\phi_0  0$. The quadrature rule is \"blind\" to the positive values of the flux function away from the center of the element. The true integral, $R = \\int_{-1}^{1} g(\\xi) d\\xi$, correctly accounts for the positive contributions from regions where $\\phi(\\xi)  0$ and is, in fact, positive. However, the one-point quadrature, by exclusively evaluating the integrand at a point where it is negative, produces a non-physical negative result for the total reaction rate. This demonstrates a key failure mode of low-order numerical integration when applied to functions with complex behavior, such as the oscillatory, non-positivity-preserving approximations sometimes encountered in high-order numerical methods for transport theory.",
