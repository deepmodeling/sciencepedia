A solution will be provided.\n\nThe core of the problem is to analyze the eigenvalues of the fission matrix $A$. In the context of the power iteration method used in Monte Carlo simulations to solve the eigenvalue problem, the vector $s_{n}$ represents the fission source distribution at iteration (or generation) $n$. The matrix $A$ propagates this source to the next generation. The convergence of this iterative process to the fundamental mode is governed by the dominance ratio $\\rho = |\\lambda_{2}/\\lambda_{1}|$, where $\\lambda_{1}$ is the eigenvalue with the largest magnitude (the fundamental eigenvalue, which approximates $k_{\\text{eff}}$) and $\\lambda_{2}$ is the eigenvalue with the second-largest magnitude.\n\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of the matrix $A$ are the solutions to the characteristic equation:\n$$\n\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0\n$$\nwhere $I$ is the identity matrix.

Since all entries of matrix $A$ are positive, the Perron-Frobenius theorem guarantees that the largest eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$ is positive and unique. Here, both eigenvalues are clearly positive.\n\nThe problem asks for the dominance ratio $\\rho$, defined as $\\rho = |\\lambda_{2}/\\lambda_{1}|$.\n$$\n\\rho = \\left| \\frac{0.90 - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{20}}{0.90 + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{20}} \\right|\n$$\nSince both numerator and denominator are positive, the absolute value is redundant.

In a bin-discretized model, the response of induced fissions in bin $j$ to a distribution of progenitor path segments or source histories in bin $i$ can be summarized by a linear operator on bin space. When this operator is represented as a matrix $F$, its principal eigenpair encodes the asymptotic mode of the fission source and its approach to the steady state. The Dominance Ratio (DR) is defined as $DR = \\left|\\lambda_{2}/\\lambda_{1}\\right|$, where $\\lambda_{1}$ and $\\lambda_{2}$ are the largest and second-largest eigenvalues in magnitude of $F$.\n\nTwo practical normalization choices arise for constructing $F$ with Monte Carlo estimators:\n- Per unit track length normalization, where entries of $F$ quantify induced fissions per unit path length of progenitor tracks.\n- Per source neutron normalization, where entries of $F$ quantify induced fissions per launched source neutron.\n\nAssume a homogeneous, one-speed transport and consistent bin definitions such that changing from per unit track length to per source neutron normalization multiplies all entries of $F$ by a single positive scalar $\\,\\alpha\\,$ equal to the mean total track length per source neutron.

We will first establish the theoretical relationship, then compute the specific values for the given matrix, and conclude with the final expression for the dominance ratio.\n\nThe first task is to relate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the fission matrix under per unit track length normalization, $F_{\\mathrm{TL}}$, and per source neutron normalization, $F_{\\mathrm{SN}}$. The problem states the relationship between these two matrices is $F_{\\mathrm{SN}} = \\alpha F_{\\mathrm{TL}}$, where $\\alpha$ is a positive scalar constant.\n\nLet $(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{TL}}, \\mathbf{v})$ be an eigenpair of $F_{\\mathrm{TL}}$, where $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{TL}}$ is an eigenvalue and $\\mathbf{v}$ is the corresponding eigenvector. By definition, they satisfy the eigenvalue equation:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{TL}} \\mathbf{v} = \\lambda_{\\mathrm{TL}} \\mathbf{v}$$\nTo find the corresponding eigenpair for $F_{\\mathrm{SN}}$, we can apply $F_{\\mathrm{SN}}$ to the eigenvector $\\mathbf{v}$. Using the given relationship between the matrices:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{SN}} \\mathbf{v} = (\\alpha F_{\\mathrm{TL}}) \\mathbf{v}$$\nBy the scalar associative property of matrix multiplication, this becomes:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{SN}} \\mathbf{v} = \\alpha (F_{\\mathrm{TL}} \\mathbf{v})$$\nSubstituting the eigenvalue equation for $F_{\\mathrm{TL}}$:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{SN}} \\mathbf{v} = \\alpha (\\lambda_{\\mathrm{TL}} \\mathbf{v})$$\nAgain, using scalar associativity:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{SN}} \\mathbf{v} = (\\alpha \\lambda_{\\mathrm{TL}}) \\mathbf{v}$$\nThis equation is the eigenvalue equation for the matrix $F_{\\mathrm{SN}}$.

The eigenvalues of $A$ will be $10\\lambda$. The characteristic equation for $A$ is $\\lambda'^3 - 12\\lambda'^2 + 43\\lambda' - 46 = 0$. By inspection, we find that $\\lambda' = 2$ is a root: $2^3 - 12(2^2) + 43(2) - 46 = 8 - 48 + 86 - 46 = 0$.\nWe perform polynomial division of $(\\lambda'^3 - 12\\lambda'^2 + 43\\lambda' - 46)$ by $(\\lambda' - 2)$, which yields the quadratic factor $(\\lambda'^2 - 10\\lambda' + 23)$.

The eigenvalues of $F_{\\mathrm{TL}}$ are these values divided by $10$:\n$$ \\lambda' / 10 \\in \\left\\{ \\frac{2}{10}, \\frac{5 - \\sqrt{2}}{10}, \\frac{5 + \\sqrt{2}}{10} \\right\\} = \\{ 0.2, \\frac{5 - \\sqrt{2}}{10}, \\frac{5 + \\sqrt{2}}{10} \\} $$\nThe matrix $F_{\\mathrm{TL}}$ has non-negative entries and is irreducible, so by the Perron-Frobenius theorem, its largest eigenvalue (spectral radius) is real, positive, and simple.

Since $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414$, all eigenvalues are positive.\nThe largest eigenvalue is $\\lambda_{1} = \\frac{5 + \\sqrt{2}}{10}$.\nThe second-largest eigenvalue is $\\lambda_{2} = \\frac{5 - \\sqrt{2}}{10}$ (since $5 - \\sqrt{2} \\approx 3.586 > 2$).\nThe smallest eigenvalue is $\\lambda_{3} = 0.2$.\n\nThe Dominance Ratio for $F_{\\mathrm{TL}}$ is defined as $DR_{\\mathrm{TL}} = |\\lambda_{2}/\\lambda_{1}|$.\n$$ DR_{\\mathrm{TL}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{5 - \\sqrt{2}}{10}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{5 + \\sqrt{2}}{10}\\right)} = \\frac{5 - \\sqrt{2}}{5 + \\sqrt{2}} $$\nNow, we infer the Dominance Ratio for $F_{\\mathrm{SN}}$. The eigenvalues of $F_{\\mathrm{SN}}$ are $\\lambda_{1, \\mathrm{SN}} = \\alpha \\lambda_{1}$ and $\\lambda_{2, \\mathrm{SN}} = \\alpha \\lambda_{2}$.\n$$ DR_{\\mathrm{SN}} = \\left|\\frac{\\lambda_{2, \\mathrm{SN}}}{\\lambda_{1, \\mathrm{SN}}}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{\\alpha \\lambda_{2}}{\\alpha \\lambda_{1}}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{\\lambda_{2}}{\\lambda_{1}}\\right| = DR_{\\mathrm{TL}} $$\nThis shows that the Dominance Ratio is invariant under a uniform positive scalar multiplication of the fission matrix. The value $\\alpha = 4.0$ is not needed to determine this equality, only that $\\alpha$ is a positive constant.\n\nThe third and final task is to provide the common Dominance Ratio as a single closed-form analytic expression. We rationalize the expression for the $DR$:\n$$ DR = \\frac{5 - \\sqrt{2}}{5 + \\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{5 - \\sqrt{2}}{5 + \\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{5 - \\sqrt{2}}{5 - \\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{(5 - \\sqrt{2})^2}{5^2 - (\\sqrt{2})^2} = \\frac{25 - 10\\sqrt{2} + 2}{25 - 2} = \\frac{27 - 10\\sqrt{2}}{23} $$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the Dominance Ratio, which is common to both $F_{\\mathrm{TL}}$ and $F_{\\mathrm{SN}}$.",

Compute\n$$\na+c = 1.76, \\quad ac = 0.768, \\quad 2b^{2} = 2(0.08)^{2} = 0.0128.\n$$\nThen\n$$\n\\lambda_{(\\pm)} = \\frac{1.76 \\pm \\sqrt{1.76^{2} - 4(0.768 - 0.0128)}}{2}\n= \\frac{1.76 \\pm \\sqrt{3.0976 - 3.0208}}{2}\n= \\frac{1.76 \\pm \\sqrt{0.0768}}{2}.\n$$\nEvaluating $\\sqrt{0.0768}$ gives\n$$\n\\sqrt{0.0768} \\approx 0.277128,\n$$\nso\n$$\n\\lambda_{(+)} \\approx \\frac{1.76 + 0.277128}{2} \\approx 1.018564,\n\\quad\n\\lambda_{(-)} \\approx \\frac{1.76 - 0.277128}{2} \\approx 0.741436.\n$$\nThe third eigenvalue is $\\lambda_{(1)} = a = 0.80$.

Compute\n$$\na+c = 1.84, \\quad ac = 0.8448, \\quad 2b^{2} = 2(0.12)^{2} = 0.0288.\n$$\nThen\n$$\n\\lambda_{(\\pm)} = \\frac{1.84 \\pm \\sqrt{1.84^{2} - 4(0.8448 - 0.0288)}}{2}\n= \\frac{1.84 \\pm \\sqrt{3.3856 - 3.2640}}{2}\n= \\frac{1.84 \\pm \\sqrt{0.1216}}{2}.\n$$\nEvaluating $\\sqrt{0.1216}$ gives\n$$\n\\sqrt{0.1216} \\approx 0.348712,\n$$\nso\n$$\n\\lambda_{(+)} \\approx \\frac{1.84 + 0.348712}{2} \\approx 1.094356,\n\\quad\n\\lambda_{(-)} \\approx \\frac{1.84 - 0.348712}{2} \\approx 0.745644.\n$$\nThe third eigenvalue is $\\lambda_{(1)} = a = 0.88$. Ordering them,\n$$\n\\lambda_{1,\\text{refl}} \\approx 1.094356,\n\\quad\n\\lambda_{2,\\text{refl}} = 0.88,\n\\quad\n\\lambda_{3,\\text{refl}} \\approx 0.745644.\n$$\n\nThe Dominance Ratio (DR) for the reflected case is defined as\n$$\n\\mathrm{DR}_{\\text{refl}} = \\frac{|\\lambda_{2,\\text{refl}}|}{|\\lambda_{1,\\text{refl}}|} = \\frac{0.88}{1.094356}.\n$$\nCompute the ratio:\n$$\n\\mathrm{DR}_{\\text{refl}} \\approx 0.804126.\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures,\n$$\n\\mathrm{DR}_{\\text{refl}} \\approx 0.8041.\n$$\n\nInterpretation: Adding reflectors increases end-cell self-generation ($a$) and coupling ($b$), which elevates the antisymmetric edge-dominated mode eigenvalue $\\lambda_{(1)}=a$ and also raises the fundamental eigenvalue $\\lambda_{(+)}$. In this construction, $\\lambda_{2}$ increases from $0.80$ to $0.88$, while $\\lambda_{1}$ increases from approximately $1.0186$ to approximately $1.0944$, yielding a larger Dominance Ratio after reflection. This reflects stronger boundary-induced coupling and reduced leakage, which sustains subdominant modes more relative to the fundamental, consistent with physical expectations of reflector effects.",
