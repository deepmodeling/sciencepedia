This first practice focuses on the 'mass matrix', which arises from terms that do not involve spatial derivatives, such as neutron absorption, scattering sources, and time-derivatives. This exercise will guide you through determining the minimum number of quadrature points needed to integrate these terms exactly, a crucial skill for ensuring the formal accuracy of your discretization .

            "problem": "In a one-dimensional pin-cell model of steady neutron diffusion for nuclear reactor simulation, consider a continuous Galerkin finite element method (CGFEM) discretization on a single affine physical element $K = [x_{e}, x_{e+1}]$ of size $h = x_{e+1} - x_{e}$. The macroscopic absorption cross section $\\Sigma_{a}$ is constant on $K$. Let the trial and test spaces be spanned by Lagrange shape functions $\\{N_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{n_{\\text{dof}}}$ of polynomial degree $p$ defined on the reference interval $\\hat{K} = [-1,1]$, and mapped to $K$ by an affine map $F : \\hat{K} \\to K$ so that $x = F(\\xi)$ and $dx = J\\,d\\xi$ with constant Jacobian $J = h/2$.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It poses a standard question in the numerical analysis of finite element methods applied to neutron diffusion, a core topic in nuclear reactor simulation. All necessary information is provided, and the terms used are precise and standard within the field.\n\nThe primary task is to determine the minimal number of Gauss-Legendre quadrature points, denoted by $n$, required for the exact evaluation of the element-level absorption mass matrix entries $M_{ij}$. The secondary task is to contrast this with mass-lumped approximations.\n\nFirst, we analyze the integral for the mass matrix entry $M_{ij}$. It is defined on the physical element $K = [x_e, x_{e+1}]$ as:\n$$\nM_{ij} = \\int_{K} \\Sigma_{a}\\,N_{i}(x)\\,N_{j}(x)\\,dx\n$$\nHere, $\\Sigma_{a}$ is the constant macroscopic absorption cross section on the element $K$. The functions $N_i(x)$ and $N_j(x)$ are Lagrange basis functions of polynomial degree $p$.\n\nTo perform the integration using a standard quadrature rule, we map the integral from the physical element $K$ to the reference element $\\hat{K} = [-1, 1]$. The problem states this is done via an affine map $x = F(\\xi)$, for which the differential element transforms as $dx = J\\,d\\xi$, with a constant Jacobian $J = \\frac{h}{2}$, where $h = x_{e+1} - x_e$. Let $\\hat{N}_i(\\xi)$ and $\\hat{N}_j(\\xi)$ be the basis functions on the reference element, such that $N_i(x) = \\hat{N}_i(F^{-1}(x))$. The integral becomes:\n$$\nM_{ij} = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\Sigma_{a}\\,\\hat{N}_{i}(\\xi)\\,\\hat{N}_{j}(\\xi)\\,J\\,d\\xi\n$$\nSince $\\Sigma_{a}$ and the Jacobian $J = \\frac{h}{2}$ are constants, we can factor them out of the integral:\n$$\nM_{ij} = \\frac{\\Sigma_{a} h}{2} \\int_{-1}^{1} \\hat{N}_{i}(\\xi)\\,\\hat{N}_{j}(\\xi)\\,d\\xi\n$$\nThe integrand, which must be integrated exactly, is the product $\\hat{N}_{i}(\\xi)\\,\\hat{N}_{j}(\\xi)$. Since the affine mapping preserves polynomial degree, the reference basis functions $\\hat{N}_{i}(\\xi)$ and $\\hat{N}_{j}(\\xi)$ are also polynomials of degree $p$ in the variable $\\xi$. The product of two polynomials of degree $p$ is a polynomial of degree at most $p+p = 2p$. Let the degree of the integrand polynomial be $D$. Thus, $D = 2p$.\n\nA Gauss-Legendre quadrature rule with $n$ points is capable of integrating polynomials of degree up to $2n-1$ exactly. To ensure exact integration of our integrand, the degree of exactness of the quadrature rule must be greater than or equal to the degree of the polynomial being integrated. This gives the condition:\n$$\n2n - 1 \\ge D\n$$\nSubstituting $D = 2p$, we get:\n$$\n2n - 1 \\ge 2p\n$$\nSolving for $n$, we find:\n$$\n2n \\ge 2p + 1\n$$\n$$\nn \\ge p + \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nSince the number of quadrature points $n$ must be an integer, the minimal integer value of $n$ that satisfies this inequality is $p+1$.\nTherefore, a minimum of $n=p+1$ Gauss-Legendre quadrature points are required to compute the mass matrix entries $M_{ij}$ exactly.\n\nFor the second part of the problem, we contrast this exact integration scheme with mass-lumping. The exact integration yields what is known as a \"consistent\" mass matrix, which is generally dense (for $p \\ge 1$), symmetric, and positive-definite.\n\nMass lumping via nodal quadrature, as described in the problem, uses the $p+1$ nodal points of the Lagrange basis functions themselves as the quadrature points. Let these nodal points on the reference element be $\\{\\hat{\\xi}_k\\}_{k=1}^{p+1}$. By the definition of Lagrange basis functions, $\\hat{N}_i(\\hat{\\xi}_k) = \\delta_{ik}$, where $\\delta_{ik}$ is the Kronecker delta. The integral is approximated as a sum:\n$$\nM_{ij} = \\frac{\\Sigma_a h}{2} \\int_{-1}^{1} \\hat{N}_i(\\xi) \\hat{N}_j(\\xi) d\\xi \\approx \\frac{\\Sigma_a h}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^{p+1} w_k \\hat{N}_i(\\hat{\\xi}_k) \\hat{N}_j(\\hat{\\xi}_k)\n$$\nwhere $w_k$ are the quadrature weights. Substituting the Kronecker delta property:\n$$\nM_{ij}^{\\text{lumped}} = \\frac{\\Sigma_a h}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^{p+1} w_k \\delta_{ik} \\delta_{jk}\n$$\nThis sum is non-zero only when $i=j=k$. Consequently, the resulting lumped mass matrix $M^{\\text{lumped}}$ is diagonal, with entries $M_{ii}^{\\text{lumped}} = \\frac{\\Sigma_a h}{2} w_i > 0$. This diagonal structure dramatically simplifies computations, especially the inversion of the mass matrix required in time-dependent problems.\n\nThe implications for the spectral properties of the absorption operator are significant. The continuous absorption operator is a multiplication by $\\Sigma_a$, and its spectrum is simply the range of values taken by $\\Sigma_a$.\nThe consistent mass matrix, while providing a higher-order accurate representation, is known to have eigenvalues that can overestimate the spectrum of the continuous operator. That is, the largest eigenvalue of the (normalized) consistent mass matrix can be larger than the maximum physical value of $\\Sigma_a$ in the domain. This spectral overestimation can negatively affect the stability of time-integration schemes and the convergence rate of iterative solvers common in reactor physics calculations (e.g., power iteration for the $k_{\\text{eff}}$ eigenvalue).\nIn contrast, the lumped mass matrix, being diagonal, has eigenvalues that are simply its diagonal entries. While the integration itself is inexact, this procedure can be constructed to preserve certain physical properties. For example, some lumping schemes guarantee that the matrix eigenvalues remain within the physical bounds of the coefficient $\\Sigma_a$. This avoids spectral overestimation and can lead to more robust and physically consistent numerical behavior, such as preserving the positivity of the neutron flux. The trade-off is a reduction in formal accuracy compared to the consistent mass formulation, but the computational benefits and improved spectral properties often make mass lumping an attractive option in practical large-scale reactor simulations.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the minimal polynomial degree of exactness, denoted by $m$, for a Gaussian quadrature rule used to compute the elemental stiffness matrix entry $a_{ij}^{K}$ exactly. The stiffness matrix entry is given by the integral:\n$$\na_{ij}^{K} = \\int_{K} D\\, \\nabla N_i \\cdot \\nabla N_j \\, dx\n$$\nwhere $K$ is a triangular finite element, $D$ is a constant diffusion coefficient, and $\\{N_i\\}$ are the scalar Lagrange basis functions of polynomial degree $p$.\n\nTo find the required degree of exactness for the numerical quadrature, we must first establish the polynomial degree of the integrand, which is the function $I(x) = D\\, \\nabla N_i(x) \\cdot \\nabla N_j(x)$.\n\nThe basis functions $N_i(x)$ are, by definition, polynomials of total degree $p$ on the element $K$. Let the spatial coordinates in the two-dimensional domain be $x = (x_1, x_2)$. A general polynomial of degree $p$ can be written as a sum of terms of the form $c_{ab} x_1^a x_2^b$ where $a+b \\le p$.\n\nThe gradient of a basis function $N_i(x)$ is a vector field given by:\n$$\n\\nabla N_i = \\left( \\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial x_1}, \\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial x_2} \\right)\n$$\nThe partial derivative of a polynomial of total degree $p$ with respect to any of its variables results in a polynomial of total degree at most $p-1$. For instance, $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_1} (x_1^a x_2^b) = a x_1^{a-1} x_2^b$, and the new total degree is $(a-1)+b = (a+b)-1 \\le p-1$. Therefore, each component of the gradient vector $\\nabla N_i$ is a polynomial of degree at most $p-1$. The same holds for $\\nabla N_j$.\n\nNext, we consider the dot product of the two gradient vectors:\n$$\n\\nabla N_i \\cdot \\nabla N_j = \\left(\\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial x_1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\partial N_j}{\\partial x_1}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial x_2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\partial N_j}{\\partial x_2}\\right)\n$$\nEach term in this sum is a product of two polynomials of degree at most $p-1$. The degree of the product of two polynomials is the sum of their individual degrees. Thus, the product of two polynomials of degree at most $p-1$ is a polynomial of degree at most $(p-1) + (p-1) = 2p-2$. The sum of two such polynomials is also a polynomial of degree at most $2p-2$.\nTherefore, the expression $\\nabla N_i \\cdot \\nabla N_j$ is a polynomial of total degree at most $2p-2$.\n\nThe complete integrand is $I(x) = D \\nabla N_i \\cdot \\nabla N_j$. The problem states that the diffusion coefficient $D$ is constant. Multiplying a polynomial by a non-zero constant does not alter its degree. Consequently, the integrand $I(x)$ is a polynomial of degree at most $2p-2$.\n\nA Gaussian quadrature rule is said to have a degree of exactness $m$ if it can integrate any polynomial of total degree up to $m$ exactly. To ensure that the integral for $a_{ij}^{K}$ is computed exactly, the quadrature rule must be able to exactly integrate the integrand $D \\nabla N_i \\cdot \\nabla N_j$. Since this integrand is a polynomial of degree at most $2p-2$, the degree of exactness $m$ of the quadrature rule must be at least $2p-2$.\n\nThe minimal degree of exactness required is therefore $m = 2p-2$.\n\nIt is noted that this result is independent of the affine mapping from the reference to the physical element. An affine map $x=F(\\hat{x})=J\\hat{x}+b$ preserves the polynomial degree of functions, and the transformation of the gradient dot product introduces a constant matrix factor $(J^T J)^{-1}$ in the reference element integrand, which does not change the polynomial degree of the expression in the reference coordinates.

Time Integration and Stability Analysis\n\nThe semi-discrete system is integrated in time using the explicit forward Euler method:\n$$\n\\mathbf{M} \\frac{\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^{n+1} - \\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^n}{\\Delta t} = -\\mathbf{K} \\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^n \\implies \\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^n - \\Delta t \\mathbf{M}^{-1} \\mathbf{K} \\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^n\n$$\nThe stability of this scheme is governed by the eigenvalues of the system matrix $\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{M}^{-1}\\mathbf{K}$. These are found by solving the generalized eigenvalue problem $\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{u} = \\lambda \\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{u}$. Since $\\mathbf{M}$ and $\\mathbf{K}$ are symmetric and positive definite, the eigenvalues $\\lambda_i$ are real and positive. The stability condition for forward Euler requires that $|1 - \\Delta t \\lambda_i| \\le 1$ for all eigenvalues $\\lambda_i$, which simplifies to $\\Delta t \\lambda_i \\le 2$. This must hold for the largest eigenvalue, leading to the stability limit:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\le \\frac{2}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{max}}}\n$$\nThis condition must be evaluated for both the consistent mass ($\\mathbf{M}$) and lumped mass ($\\mathbf{M}_{\\mathrm{lump}}$) systems, which yield different maximum eigenvalues.\n\n### 5. Solution Analysis and Implementation\n\n-   **Initial Condition**: The initial nodal vector $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^0$ is obtained by evaluating the initial condition $\\phi(x,0) = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi x}{L})$ at the interior nodes: $\\Phi_j(0) = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi x_j}{L})$ for $j=1, \\dots, N-1$. This corresponds to the first eigenmode of the discrete system.\n-   **Modal Amplitude**: The analytic solution for the first mode is $\\phi(x,t) = A(t)\\sin(\\frac{\\pi x}{L})$ where the amplitude is $A(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\left(\\alpha(\\frac{\\pi}{L})^2+\\beta\\right)t\\right)$. The numerical amplitude of the solution vector $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^n$ along the first mode shape $\\mathbf{u}_1 = \\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^0$ is measured using the consistent mass inner product $\\langle \\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{w} \\rangle_{\\mathbf{M}} = \\mathbf{v}^T \\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{w}$:\n    $$\n    A^n_{\\mathrm{num}} = \\frac{\\langle \\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^n, \\mathbf{u}_1 \\rangle_{\\mathbf{M}}}{\\langle \\mathbf{u}_1, \\mathbf{u}_1 \\rangle_{\\mathbf{M}}} = \\frac{(\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^n)^T \\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{u}_1}{\\mathbf{u}_1^T \\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{u}_1}\n    $$\n    The error is the absolute difference $|A^n_{\\mathrm{num}} - A(t_n)|$ at the final time step.\n-   **Positivity**: For case 3, the time-evolved solution vectors $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^n$ are checked at each step. The solution is considered non-positive if any nodal value $\\Phi_j^n$ becomes negative beyond a small numerical tolerance (e.g., $-10^{-12}$). The consistent mass FEM is known to potentially violate positivity under certain conditions even when the scheme is stable, whereas lumping often remedies this.\n\nThe implementation will follow these principles, constructing the matrices, solving the eigenvalue problem to determine time steps and stability, performing the time integration, and finally computing the required metrics for each of the three test cases.",
