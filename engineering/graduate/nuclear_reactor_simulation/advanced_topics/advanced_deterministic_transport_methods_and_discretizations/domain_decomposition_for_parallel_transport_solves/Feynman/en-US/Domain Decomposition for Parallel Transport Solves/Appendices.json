The outward normal on the right boundary of $D_{L}$ points to the right, and the outward normal on the left boundary of $D_{R}$ points to the left.\n\nA control-volume or Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization of the equation over each subdomain yields a discrete balance for the contribution of a single discrete ordinate direction $\\mu_{k}$ with quadrature weight $w_{k}$ to the scalar flux balance $\\phi(x) \\approx \\sum_{k} w_{k} \\psi(x,\\mu_{k})$. The interface contribution for ordinate $k$ enters the two discrete balances as $-w_{k} \\mu_{k} \\widehat{\\psi}_{k,L}$ for $D_{L}$ and $+w_{k} \\mu_{k} \\widehat{\\psi}_{k,R}$ for $D_{R}$, where $\\widehat{\\psi}_{k,L}$ and $\\widehat{\\psi}_{k,R}$ are numerical fluxes determined from traces $\\psi_{k,L} := \\lim_{x \\to x_{I}^{-}} \\psi(x,\\mu_{k})$ and $\\psi_{k,R} := \\lim_{x \\to x_{I}^{+}} \\psi(x,\\mu_{k})$.\n\nAssume the following general linear form for the numerical flux in terms of interface traces for a given ordinate $\\mu_{k}$:\n$$\\widehat{\\psi}_{k,L} = \\omega_{L} \\psi_{k,L} + \\left(1 - \\omega_{L}\\right) \\psi_{k,R} + \\tau_{L} \\left(\\psi_{k,L} - \\psi_{k,R}\\right),$$\n$$\\widehat{\\psi}_{k,R} = \\omega_{R} \\psi_{k,R} + \\left(1 - \\omega_{R}\\right) \\psi_{k,L} + \\tau_{R} \\left(\\psi_{k,R} - \\psi_{k,L}\\right),$$\nwhere $\\omega_{L}, \\omega_{R} \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $\\tau_{L}, \\tau_{R} \\in \\mathbb{R}$ are numerical parameters chosen to define the interface fluxes on the left and right subdomains, respectively.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a condition on a set of numerical parameters to ensure that a discrete particle transport scheme is conservative across a subdomain interface. The analysis begins with the fundamental principle of conservation in a control-volume formulation.\n\nIn a steady-state problem, the net flux of particles across the boundary of a composite domain must equal the net effect of sources and sinks within that domain. When two subdomains, $D_{L} = [x_{a}, x_{I}]$ and $D_{R} = [x_{I}, x_{b}]$, are combined to form the larger domain $[x_{a}, x_{b}]$, the interface at $x=x_{I}$ becomes an internal boundary. For the global balance equation, which is the sum of the balance equations for $D_{L}$ and $D_{R}$, the numerical contributions from this internal interface must cancel out exactly. This is the mathematical statement of conservation at the discrete level.\n\nThe problem provides the interface contributions to the scalar flux balance for a single discrete ordinate, $\\mu_{k}$, for the left and right subdomains. For subdomain $D_{L}$, this contribution is $-w_{k} \\mu_{k} \\widehat{\\psi}_{k,L}$. For subdomain $D_{R}$, it is $+w_{k} \\mu_{k} \\widehat{\\psi}_{k,R}$. The conservation principle dictates that the sum of these two terms must be zero:\n$$-w_{k} \\mu_{k} \\widehat{\\psi}_{k,L} + w_{k} \\mu_{k} \\widehat{\\psi}_{k,R} = 0$$\nThis equation must hold for any discrete ordinate direction $\\mu_{k}$ with its corresponding quadrature weight $w_{k}$. Assuming non-trivial directions where $w_{k} \\neq 0$ and $\\mu_{k} \\neq 0$, the condition simplifies to:\n$$\\widehat{\\psi}_{k,R} - \\widehat{\\psi}_{k,L} = 0$$\nor\n$$\\widehat{\\psi}_{k,L} = \\widehat{\\psi}_{k,R}$$\nThis is the condition of a single-valued numerical flux, which is the discrete analogue of flux continuity. To find the constraint on the parameters, we substitute the given expressions for the numerical fluxes $\\widehat{\\psi}_{k,L}$ and $\\widehat{\\psi}_{k,R}$ into this equality.\n\nThe given numerical fluxes are:\n$$\\widehat{\\psi}_{k,L} = \\omega_{L} \\psi_{k,L} + \\left(1 - \\omega_{L}\\right) \\psi_{k,R} + \\tau_{L} \\left(\\psi_{k,L} - \\psi_{k,R}\\right)$$\n$$\\widehat{\\psi}_{k,R} = \\omega_{R} \\psi_{k,R} + \\left(1 - \\omega_{R}\\right) \\psi_{k,L} + \\tau_{R} \\left(\\psi_{k,R} - \\psi_{k,L}\\right)$$\nSetting these two expressions equal yields:\n$$\\omega_{L} \\psi_{k,L} + \\left(1 - \\omega_{L}\\right) \\psi_{k,R} + \\tau_{L} \\left(\\psi_{k,L} - \\psi_{k,R}\\right) = \\omega_{R} \\psi_{k,R} + \\left(1 - \\omega_{R}\\right) \\psi_{k,L} + \\tau_{R} \\left(\\psi_{k,R} - \\psi_{k,L}\\right)$$\nThis equality must be satisfied for arbitrary interface traces $\\psi_{k,L}$ and $\\psi_{k,R}$. This implies that the coefficients of $\\psi_{k,L}$ and $\\psi_{k,R}$ on both sides of the equation must be independently equal. We can group the terms by $\\psi_{k,L}$ and $\\psi_{k,R}$:\n$$ \\psi_{k,L} \\left(\\omega_{L} + \\tau_{L}\\right) + \\psi_{k,R} \\left(1 - \\omega_{L} - \\tau_{L}\\right) = \\psi_{k,L} \\left(1 - \\omega_{R} - \\tau_{R}\\right) + \\psi_{k,R} \\left(\\omega_{R} + \\tau_{R}\\right) $$\nBy equating the coefficients of $\\psi_{k,L}$:\n$$ \\omega_{L} + \\tau_{L} = 1 - \\omega_{R} - \\tau_{R} \\quad (1) $$\nBy equating the coefficients of $\\psi_{k,R}$:\n$$ 1 - \\omega_{L} - \\tau_{L} = \\omega_{R} + \\tau_{R} \\quad (2) $$\nBoth equations are identical. Rearranging either equation to solve for $\\tau_{R}$ gives the required condition. From equation $(1)$:\n$$ \\tau_{R} = 1 - \\omega_{L} - \\omega_{R} - \\tau_{L} $$\nThis condition ensures that the numerical flux is single-valued at the interface, which in turn guarantees that the discrete scalar flux balance is conservative across the interface for any choice of interface flux traces and for any ordinate. The problem asks for the value of $\\tau_{R}$ that ensures this conservation. The derived relation provides this value.",
