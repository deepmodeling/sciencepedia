            "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional, homogeneous, one-group, steady-state neutron diffusion model for a symmetric slab reactor. Let the computational domain be the half-core interval $x \\in [0, L]$, with $L > 0$ finite and constant material properties. The scalar neutron flux is $\\phi(x)$ and the neutron current density is $\\mathbf{J}(x)$. Assume the standard Fick’s law for neutron transport, $\\mathbf{J}(x) = - D \\nabla \\phi(x)$, where $D > 0$ is the diffusion coefficient, and the one-group neutron balance in the absence of external sources, $- \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J}(x) + \\Sigma_{a} \\phi(x) = \\nu \\Sigma_{f} \\phi(x)$, where $\\Sigma_{a} > 0$ is the macroscopic absorption cross section, $\\nu \\Sigma_{f} \\ge 0$ is the macroscopic production via fission, and spatial homogeneity holds so these coefficients are constants. The outer boundary at $x = L$ is idealized as strongly absorbing, so the scalar flux vanishes there: $\\phi(L) = 0$.\n\nAt the symmetry plane $x = 0$, the physically correct boundary condition is zero net current across the plane, $J_{n}(0) = 0$, where $J_{n}$ denotes the component of current normal to the plane.

It is not incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic (within the model's assumptions), or ill-posed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe first step is to derive the governing differential equation for the scalar flux $\\phi(x)$. We start with the neutron balance equation:\n$$\n- \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J}(x) + \\Sigma_{a} \\phi(x) = \\nu \\Sigma_{f} \\phi(x)\n$$\nIn one dimension, the divergence operator $\\nabla \\cdot$ becomes $\\frac{d}{dx}$, and the gradient $\\nabla$ becomes $\\frac{d}{dx}$. Substituting Fick's law, $\\mathbf{J}(x) = - D \\frac{d\\phi}{dx}$, into the balance equation gives:\n$$\n- \\frac{d}{dx} \\left(-D \\frac{d\\phi(x)}{dx}\\right) + \\Sigma_{a} \\phi(x) = \\nu \\Sigma_{f} \\phi(x)\n$$\nSince the medium is homogeneous, the diffusion coefficient $D$ is constant. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\nD \\frac{d^2\\phi(x)}{dx^2} + (\\nu \\Sigma_{f} - \\Sigma_{a}) \\phi(x) = 0\n$$\nThis can be rewritten in the form of a standard Helmholtz equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\phi(x)}{dx^2} + B^2 \\phi(x) = 0\n$$\nwhere $B^2 = \\frac{\\nu \\Sigma_{f} - \\Sigma_{a}}{D}$ is the material buckling. For a non-trivial, oscillatory solution to exist, which is physically required for a critical reactor core, we assume $B^2 > 0$.\n\nNext, we solve this equation for the two specified sets of boundary conditions to find the fundamental eigenmodes.\n\n**Case 1: Correct Boundary Conditions**\nThe boundary value problem is defined by the differential equation on $x \\in [0, L]$ with a zero-current (Neumann) condition at the symmetry plane and a zero-flux (Dirichlet) condition at the outer boundary:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\phi_c(x)}{dx^2} + B_c^2 \\phi_c(x) = 0, \\quad \\frac{d\\phi_c}{dx}(0) = 0, \\quad \\phi_c(L) = 0\n$$\nThe general solution to the differential equation is $\\phi_c(x) = A \\cos(B_c x) + C \\sin(B_c x)$.\nApplying the first boundary condition, $\\frac{d\\phi_c}{dx}(x) = -A B_c \\sin(B_c x) + C B_c \\cos(B_c x)$, so $\\frac{d\\phi_c}{dx}(0) = C B_c = 0$. For a non-trivial solution, we require $B_c \\neq 0$, which implies $C=0$. The solution is thus of the form $\\phi_c(x) = A \\cos(B_c x)$.\nApplying the second boundary condition, $\\phi_c(L) = A \\cos(B_c L) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution ($A \\neq 0$), we must have $\\cos(B_c L) = 0$. This condition dictates the allowed values for the buckling, $B_c$. The solutions are $B_c L = \\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{2}$ for $n=0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\nThe fundamental eigenmode corresponds to the lowest spatial frequency, which is the smallest positive value of $B_c$. This occurs for $n=0$, giving $B_{c,0} = \\frac{\\pi}{2L}$. The fundamental eigenmode shape is therefore:\n$$\n\\phi_c(x) = A_c \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{2L}\\right)\n$$\n\n**Case 2: Erroneous Boundary Conditions**\nThe boundary value problem is now defined with a zero-flux (Dirichlet) condition at both boundaries:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\phi_e(x)}{dx^2} + B_e^2 \\phi_e(x) = 0, \\quad \\phi_e(0) = 0, \\quad \\phi_e(L) = 0\n$$\nThe general solution is $\\phi_e(x) = A \\sin(B_e x) + C \\cos(B_e x)$.\nApplying the first boundary condition, $\\phi_e(0) = C = 0$. The solution simplifies to $\\phi_e(x) = A \\sin(B_e x)$.\nApplying the second boundary condition, $\\phi_e(L) = A \\sin(B_e L) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution, $\\sin(B_e L) = 0$. The allowed values for buckling are $B_e L = n\\pi$ for $n=1, 2, 3, \\dots$ (n=0 yields the trivial solution $\\phi_e(x)=0$).\nThe fundamental eigenmode corresponds to the smallest positive $B_e$, which occurs for $n=1$, giving $B_{e,0} = \\frac{\\pi}{L}$. The fundamental eigenmode shape is:\n$$\n\\phi_e(x) = A_e \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)\n$$\n\n**Normalization of Eigenmodes**\nThe eigenmodes must be normalized to have a unit $L^{2}(0, L)$ norm. The squared norm is given by $\\|\\psi\\|_{L^2}^2 = \\int_0^L |\\psi(x)|^2 dx$.\n\nFor the correct eigenmode $\\phi_c(x)$, we set its norm to $1$:\n$$\n\\int_0^L \\left(A_c \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{2L}\\right)\\right)^2 dx = 1 \\implies A_c^2 \\int_0^L \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{2L}\\right) dx = 1\n$$\nUsing the identity $\\cos^2(\\theta) = \\frac{1+\\cos(2\\theta)}{2}$, the integral is:\n$$\n\\int_0^L \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 + \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\right) dx = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[x + \\frac{L}{\\pi}\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\right]_0^L = \\frac{1}{2}(L+0 - 0) = \\frac{L}{2}\n$$\nSo, $A_c^2 (\\frac{L}{2}) = 1$, which gives the normalization constant $A_c = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}}$. The normalized correct eigenmode is:\n$$\n\\hat{\\phi}_c(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{2L}\\right)\n$$\nFor the erroneous eigenmode $\\phi_e(x)$, we perform a similar normalization:\n$$\n\\int_0^L \\left(A_e \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\right)^2 dx = 1 \\implies A_e^2 \\int_0^L \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) dx = 1\n$$\nUsing the identity $\\sin^2(\\theta) = \\frac{1-\\cos(2\\theta)}{2}$, the integral is:\n$$\n\\int_0^L \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\right) dx = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[x - \\frac{L}{2\\pi}\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\right]_0^L = \\frac{1}{2}(L-0 - 0) = \\frac{L}{2}\n$$\nSo, $A_e^2 (\\frac{L}{2}) = 1$, which gives the normalization constant $A_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}}$. The normalized erroneous eigenmode is:\n$$\n\\hat{\\phi}_e(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)\n$$\n\n**Computation of the Distortion $\\mathcal{E}$**\nThe distortion $\\mathcal{E}$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E} = \\frac{\\|\\hat{\\phi}_c - \\hat{\\phi}_e\\|_{L^2}}{\\|\\hat{\\phi}_c\\|_{L^2}}\n$$\nSince $\\hat{\\phi}_c$ is normalized, its norm $\\|\\hat{\\phi}_c\\|_{L^2}$ is $1$. Thus, $\\mathcal{E} = \\|\\hat{\\phi}_c - \\hat{\\phi}_e\\|_{L^2}$.\nWe compute the square of the distortion, $\\mathcal{E}^2$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}^2 = \\int_0^L (\\hat{\\phi}_c(x) - \\hat{\\phi}_e(x))^2 dx = \\int_0^L \\hat{\\phi}_c(x)^2 dx + \\int_0^L \\hat{\\phi}_e(x)^2 dx - 2\\int_0^L \\hat{\\phi}_c(x) \\hat{\\phi}_e(x) dx\n$$\nBy normalization, $\\int_0^L \\hat{\\phi}_c(x)^2 dx = \\|\\hat{\\phi}_c\\|_{L^2}^2 = 1$ and $\\int_0^L \\hat{\\phi}_e(x)^2 dx = \\|\\hat{\\phi}_e\\|_{L^2}^2 = 1$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}^2 = 1 + 1 - 2 \\langle \\hat{\\phi}_c, \\hat{\\phi}_e \\rangle_{L^2} = 2 - 2 \\int_0^L \\hat{\\phi}_c(x) \\hat{\\phi}_e(x) dx\n$$\nWe now calculate the inner product integral:\n$$\n\\int_0^L \\hat{\\phi}_c(x) \\hat{\\phi}_e(x) dx = \\int_0^L \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{2L}\\right)\\right) \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\right) dx = \\frac{2}{L} \\int_0^L \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{2L}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) dx\n$$\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\sin(2\\theta) = 2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)$, we can write $\\sin(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}) = 2\\sin(\\frac{\\pi x}{2L})\\cos(\\frac{\\pi x}{2L})$. The integral becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{2}{L} \\int_0^L \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{2L}\\right) \\left(2\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{2L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{2L}\\right)\\right) dx = \\frac{4}{L} \\int_0^L \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{2L}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{2L}\\right) dx\n$$\nLet's evaluate this definite integral by substitution. Let $u = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{2L}\\right)$. Then $du = -\\frac{\\pi}{2L}\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{2L}\\right) dx$. The limits of integration change from $x=0$ to $u=\\cos(0)=1$, and from $x=L$ to $u=\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2})=0$.\n$$\n\\frac{4}{L} \\int_1^0 u^2 \\left(-\\frac{2L}{\\pi} du\\right) = -\\frac{8}{\\pi} \\int_1^0 u^2 du = \\frac{8}{\\pi} \\int_0^1 u^2 du = \\frac{8}{\\pi} \\left[\\frac{u^3}{3}\\right]_0^1 = \\frac{8}{3\\pi}\n$$\nThe inner product is $\\langle \\hat{\\phi}_c, \\hat{\\phi}_e \\rangle_{L^2} = \\frac{8}{3\\pi}$.\nNow, we substitute this back into the expression for $\\mathcal{E}^2$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}^2 = 2 - 2 \\left(\\frac{8}{3\\pi}\\right) = 2 - \\frac{16}{3\\pi}\n$$\nFinally, the distortion $\\mathcal{E}$ is the square root of this value:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E} = \\sqrt{2 - \\frac{16}{3\\pi}}\n$$\nThis is the final exact analytical expression for the distortion.",

            "problem": "A one-dimensional homogeneous uranium dioxide fuel slab of physical half-thickness $a = 50 \\ \\text{cm}$ is modeled with one-group neutron diffusion theory at steady state. The material properties are constant throughout: diffusion coefficient $D = 1.2 \\ \\text{cm}$, absorption macroscopic cross section $\\Sigma_{a} = 0.010 \\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$, and fission production term $\\nu \\Sigma_{f} = 0.0125 \\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$. The modeled slab is initially bounded on both sides by perfectly reflective boundaries. Reflective boundaries enforce zero normal neutron current, which eliminates leakage and can confine the flux, thereby overpredicting the neutron multiplication factor $k$ relative to a leaky system.\n\nUsing first principles of the diffusion approximation and appropriate boundary conditions, demonstrate why perfectly reflective boundaries at both faces of the slab remove leakage and therefore maximize $k$. Then correct the model to emulate physical leakage by adjusting the modeled domain as follows: retain a reflective boundary at the midplane $x=0$ (by symmetry) and enforce a vacuum condition at an extrapolated plane located at $x=a+z_{0}$, where the extrapolation distance is $z_{0} = \\beta L$, with $L = \\sqrt{D/\\Sigma_{a}}$ the diffusion length and $\\beta = 0.7104$ for plane geometry under isotropic conditions in diffusion theory.

Report $k$ as a dimensionless value rounded to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and self-contained. All necessary physical constants and boundary conditions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions. It represents a standard problem in nuclear reactor physics based on one-group neutron diffusion theory. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe analysis proceeds in two parts as requested. First, we demonstrate that perfectly reflective boundaries eliminate neutron leakage and maximize the neutron multiplication factor, $k$. Second, we compute the corrected value of $k$ for the physically realistic model with leakage.\n\nThe one-group, steady-state neutron diffusion equation for a homogeneous multiplying medium is given by:\n$$ -D \\nabla^2 \\phi(\\mathbf{r}) + \\Sigma_a \\phi(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{1}{k} \\nu \\Sigma_f \\phi(\\mathbf{r}) $$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, $\\Sigma_a$ is the macroscopic absorption cross section, $\\nu \\Sigma_f$ is the neutron production cross section term, $\\phi(\\mathbf{r})$ is the neutron flux at position $\\mathbf{r}$, and $k$ is the effective neutron multiplication factor.\n\nThis equation can be rearranged into the form of a Helmholtz equation:\n$$ \\nabla^2 \\phi(\\mathbf{r}) + \\left( \\frac{\\frac{1}{k} \\nu \\Sigma_f - \\Sigma_a}{D} \\right) \\phi(\\mathbf{r}) = 0 $$\nWe define the material buckling, $B_m^2$, as:\n$$ B_m^2 = \\frac{\\frac{1}{k} \\nu \\Sigma_f - \\Sigma_a}{D} $$\nFor a critical system in its fundamental mode, the material buckling must equal the geometric buckling, $B_g^2$, which is determined by the geometry and boundary conditions of the system. Setting $B_m^2 = B_g^2$, we can solve for $k$:\n$$ D B_g^2 = \\frac{1}{k} \\nu \\Sigma_f - \\Sigma_a \\implies k = \\frac{\\nu \\Sigma_f}{\\Sigma_a + D B_g^2} $$\nThis expression can be conveniently written using the infinite multiplication factor, $k_\\infty = \\frac{\\nu \\Sigma_f}{\\Sigma_a}$, and the neutron diffusion length squared, $L^2 = \\frac{D}{\\Sigma_a}$:\n$$ k = \\frac{\\nu \\Sigma_f / \\Sigma_a}{1 + (D/\\Sigma_a) B_g^2} = \\frac{k_\\infty}{1 + L^2 B_g^2} $$\nThe term $L^2 B_g^2$ represents the ratio of neutron leakage to neutron absorption. Since $L^2 > 0$, the multiplication factor $k$ is maximized when the geometric buckling $B_g^2$ is minimized. The geometric buckling is the lowest eigenvalue of the Helmholtz equation $\\nabla^2 \\phi + B_g^2 \\phi = 0$ that satisfies the boundary conditions and corresponds to a non-negative flux. As an eigenvalue of this operator, $B_g^2$ must be non-negative. Its minimum possible value is $0$.\n\nNow, let us analyze the effect of perfectly reflective boundaries. A reflective boundary is defined by the condition of zero net neutron current normal to the surface. According to Fick's law, the neutron current vector $\\mathbf{J}(\\mathbf{r})$ is given by $\\mathbf{J}(\\mathbf{r}) = -D \\nabla \\phi(\\mathbf{r})$. A reflective boundary condition at a surface with normal vector $\\mathbf{n}$ is thus $\\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = -D \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial n} = 0$.\n\nFor the one-dimensional slab of half-thickness $a$ centered at $x=0$, the domain is $[-a, a]$. The diffusion equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^2} + B_g^2 \\phi(x) = 0 $$\nThe reflective boundary conditions at both faces are $\\frac{d\\phi}{dx}|_{x=-a} = 0$ and $\\frac{d\\phi}{dx}|_{x=a} = 0$. Since the problem is symmetric about $x=0$, the fundamental mode flux must be an even function, so its general form is $\\phi(x) = C \\cos(B_g x)$ for some constant $C$. The derivative is $\\frac{d\\phi}{dx} = -C B_g \\sin(B_g x)$. Applying the boundary condition at $x=a$:\n$$ -C B_g \\sin(B_g a) = 0 $$\nFor a non-trivial solution ($C \\neq 0$), and assuming $B_g \\neq 0$, we would require $\\sin(B_g a) = 0$, which implies $B_g a = n\\pi$ for $n=1, 2, ...$. However, the case $B_g=0$ is also a valid mathematical solution corresponding to $\\phi(x)=C$, which satisfies both boundary conditions. This corresponds to the lowest possible eigenvalue, $B_g^2=0$. This is the fundamental mode for a fully reflected system. With $B_g^2=0$, the leakage term $L^2 B_g^2$ becomes $0$, and $k$ achieves its maximum value:\n$$ k = \\frac{k_\\infty}{1 + 0} = k_\\infty = \\frac{\\nu\\Sigma_f}{\\Sigma_a} $$\nThis demonstrates that perfectly reflective boundaries remove all neutron leakage, resulting in a system that behaves as if it were infinite in extent and maximizing the multiplication factor.\n\nNext, we correct the model to account for physical leakage. The problem specifies a reflective boundary at the midplane $x=0$ (due to symmetry) and a vacuum boundary condition at an extrapolated distance $z_0$ from the physical face at $x=a$. The vacuum boundary condition implies that the neutron flux goes to zero at this extrapolated boundary. The new boundary conditions are:\n1. Symmetry at the midplane: $\\frac{d\\phi}{dx}|_{x=0} = 0$.\n2. Vacuum at the extrapolated boundary: $\\phi(a+z_0) = 0$.\n\nLet $\\tilde{a} = a+z_0$ be the extrapolated half-thickness. The diffusion equation remains $\\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^2} + B_g^2 \\phi(x) = 0$. The symmetry condition $\\frac{d\\phi}{dx}|_{x=0} = 0$ again leads to a solution of the form $\\phi(x) = C \\cos(B_g x)$. Applying the vacuum boundary condition at $x=\\tilde{a}$:\n$$ \\phi(\\tilde{a}) = C \\cos(B_g \\tilde{a}) = 0 $$\nFor a non-trivial solution, we must have $\\cos(B_g \\tilde{a}) = 0$. The fundamental mode corresponds to the smallest positive value of the argument, which is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n$$ B_g \\tilde{a} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\implies B_g = \\frac{\\pi}{2\\tilde{a}} $$\nThe geometric buckling is $B_g^2 = \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2\\tilde{a}} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2(a+z_0)} \\right)^2$.\n\nWe are given the values:\n$a = 50 \\ \\text{cm}$\n$D = 1.2 \\ \\text{cm}$\n$\\Sigma_{a} = 0.010 \\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$\n$\\nu \\Sigma_{f} = 0.0125 \\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$\n$\\beta = 0.7104$\n\nFirst, we calculate the diffusion length $L$ and the extrapolation distance $z_0$:\n$$ L = \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{\\Sigma_a}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1.2 \\ \\text{cm}}{0.010 \\ \\text{cm}^{-1}}} = \\sqrt{120} \\ \\text{cm} $$\n$$ z_0 = \\beta L = 0.7104 \\sqrt{120} \\ \\text{cm} $$\n\nNow, we compute the extrapolated half-thickness $\\tilde{a}$:\n$$ \\tilde{a} = a + z_0 = 50 \\ \\text{cm} + 0.7104 \\sqrt{120} \\ \\text{cm} \\approx 50 + 7.78205 = 57.78205 \\ \\text{cm} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the geometric buckling $B_g^2$:\n$$ B_g^2 = \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2\\tilde{a}} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2(50 + 0.7104\\sqrt{120})} \\right)^2 \\ \\text{cm}^{-2} $$\n$$ B_g^2 \\approx \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2(57.78205)} \\right)^2 \\approx \\left( \\frac{3.14159}{115.5641} \\right)^2 \\approx (0.027183)^2 \\approx 0.00073898 \\ \\text{cm}^{-2} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the corrected multiplication factor $k$ using the formula derived earlier:\n$$ k = \\frac{\\nu \\Sigma_f}{D B_g^2 + \\Sigma_a} $$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$ k = \\frac{0.0125}{1.2 \\times 0.00073898 + 0.010} $$\n$$ k = \\frac{0.0125}{0.00088678 + 0.010} = \\frac{0.0125}{0.01088678} \\approx 1.148179 $$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ k \\approx 1.148 $$\nThis value is less than $k_\\infty = \\frac{0.0125}{0.010} = 1.25$, as expected for a finite system with neutron leakage.",

Two physically relevant boundary conditions are imposed on the outward normal:\n- Zero-current (reflective) boundary: $J_{n} \\equiv \\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = 0$, which is equivalent to $\\partial_{n} \\phi = 0$ when $D$ is nonzero.\n- Extrapolated (Robin) boundary: $\\phi + \\delta \\, \\partial_{n} \\phi = 0$, where $\\delta>0$ is the extrapolation length associated with the transport-to-diffusion closure.\n\nAdopt a node-centered finite difference discretization along the local outward normal coordinate $s$ that increases in the outward direction, with the boundary node located at $s=0$ and nodal spacing $h>0$ uniform along $s$. Let $\\phi_{0}=\\phi(0)$ be the unknown flux at the boundary node, $\\phi_{-1}=\\phi(-h)$ be the unknown flux at the first interior node located one mesh spacing into the domain, and introduce a single ghost node outside the domain at $s=+h$ with value $\\phi_{+1}=\\phi(h)$. Using only:\n- Fick's law and the definitions of the boundary conditions above,\n- Taylor expansions about $s=0$ to justify a second-order accurate centered difference representation of $\\partial_{n} \\phi$ at the boundary, and\n- The uniform mesh spacing $h$,\n\nderive finite-difference formulas that eliminate the ghost node by expressing $\\phi_{+1}$ in terms of $\\phi_{-1}$, $\\phi_{0}$, $h$, and $\\delta$ under each boundary condition. Your derivation must start from the definitions above and proceed by constructing a second-order accurate centered approximation for $\\partial_{n}\\phi$ at $s=0$ using the nodes at $s=\\pm h$. Then, enforce each boundary condition to obtain $\\phi_{+1}$ expressed in terms of $\\phi_{-1}$, $\\phi_{0}$, $h$, and $\\delta$.\n\nProvide your final answer as a two-entry row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} \\phi_{+1}\\big|_{\\text{Neumann}} & \\phi_{+1}\\big|_{\\text{Robin}} \\end{pmatrix}$, a closed-form analytic expression. No numerical evaluation or rounding is required, and no units should be included in the final expression.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of finite difference formulas for the value of a ghost node flux, $\\phi_{+1}$, under two different boundary conditions: a zero-current (Neumann) condition and an extrapolated (Robin) condition. The derivation must be based on a second-order accurate centered difference approximation for the normal derivative of the neutron flux at the boundary. The coordinate along the outward normal is denoted by $s$, with the boundary at $s=0$, the first interior node at $s=-h$, and the ghost node at $s=+h$. The corresponding flux values are $\\phi_{0}=\\phi(0)$, $\\phi_{-1}=\\phi(-h)$, and $\\phi_{+1}=\\phi(h)$, respectively.\n\nThe first step is to construct a second-order accurate finite difference approximation for the normal derivative $\\partial_{n}\\phi$ at the boundary $s=0$. In this one-dimensional coordinate system, this derivative is equivalent to $\\frac{d\\phi}{ds}$ evaluated at $s=0$. We use Taylor series expansions for the flux $\\phi(s)$ around the point $s=0$.\n\nThe Taylor expansion for $\\phi(s)$ at $s=+h$ is:\n$$ \\phi(h) = \\phi(0) + h \\left.\\frac{d\\phi}{ds}\\right|_{s=0} + \\frac{h^2}{2} \\left.\\frac{d^2\\phi}{ds^2}\\right|_{s=0} + \\frac{h^3}{6} \\left.\\frac{d^3\\phi}{ds^3}\\right|_{s=0} + \\mathcal{O}(h^4) $$\nIn terms of the nodal values, this is:\n$$ \\phi_{+1} = \\phi_0 + h \\phi'(0) + \\frac{h^2}{2} \\phi''(0) + \\frac{h^3}{6} \\phi'''(0) + \\mathcal{O}(h^4) $$\n\nThe Taylor expansion for $\\phi(s)$ at $s=-h$ is:\n$$ \\phi(-h) = \\phi(0) - h \\left.\\frac{d\\phi}{ds}\\right|_{s=0} + \\frac{h^2}{2} \\left.\\frac{d^2\\phi}{ds^2}\\right|_{s=0} - \\frac{h^3}{6} \\left.\\frac{d^3\\phi}{ds^3}\\right|_{s=0} + \\mathcal{O}(h^4) $$\nIn terms of the nodal values, this is:\n$$ \\phi_{-1} = \\phi_0 - h \\phi'(0) + \\frac{h^2}{2} \\phi''(0) - \\frac{h^3}{6} \\phi'''(0) + \\mathcal{O}(h^4) $$\n\nTo obtain a centered difference approximation for the first derivative $\\phi'(0)$, we subtract the second expansion from the first:\n$$ \\phi_{+1} - \\phi_{-1} = \\left(\\phi_0 + h \\phi'(0) + \\frac{h^2}{2} \\phi''(0) + \\frac{h^3}{6} \\phi'''(0)\\right) - \\left(\\phi_0 - h \\phi'(0) + \\frac{h^2}{2} \\phi''(0) - \\frac{h^3}{6} \\phi'''(0)\\right) + \\mathcal{O}(h^5) $$\n$$ \\phi_{+1} - \\phi_{-1} = 2h \\phi'(0) + \\frac{h^3}{3} \\phi'''(0) + \\mathcal{O}(h^5) $$\nSolving for $\\phi'(0)$, we get:\n$$ \\phi'(0) = \\frac{\\phi_{+1} - \\phi_{-1}}{2h} - \\frac{h^2}{6} \\phi'''(0) - \\mathcal{O}(h^4) $$\nTruncating the higher-order terms yields the second-order accurate centered difference approximation for the derivative at the boundary:\n$$ \\left. \\partial_{n}\\phi \\right|_{s=0} = \\phi'(0) \\approx \\frac{\\phi_{+1} - \\phi_{-1}}{2h} $$\n\nNow, we apply this approximation to the two specified boundary conditions to find expressions for $\\phi_{+1}$.\n\n1.  **Zero-current (Neumann) boundary condition:**\n    The condition is given as $J_n=0$, which for a non-zero diffusion coefficient $D$ is equivalent to $\\partial_{n}\\phi = 0$ at the boundary. Applying this at $s=0$:\n    $$ \\left. \\partial_{n}\\phi \\right|_{s=0} = 0 $$\n    Using our centered difference approximation:\n    $$ \\frac{\\phi_{+1} - \\phi_{-1}}{2h} = 0 $$\n    Since $h>0$, this simplifies to:\n    $$ \\phi_{+1} - \\phi_{-1} = 0 $$\n    Thus, the expression for the ghost node value under the zero-current condition is:\n    $$ \\phi_{+1} = \\phi_{-1} $$\n\n2.  **Extrapolated (Robin) boundary condition:**\n    The condition is given as $\\phi + \\delta \\, \\partial_{n}\\phi = 0$ at the boundary, where $\\delta > 0$. Evaluating this at the boundary node $s=0$:\n    $$ \\phi(0) + \\delta \\left. \\partial_{n}\\phi \\right|_{s=0} = 0 $$\n    Substituting the nodal value $\\phi_0$ and the centered difference approximation:\n    $$ \\phi_0 + \\delta \\left(\\frac{\\phi_{+1} - \\phi_{-1}}{2h}\\right) = 0 $$\n    We now solve this algebraic equation for $\\phi_{+1}$:\n    $$ \\delta \\left(\\frac{\\phi_{+1} - \\phi_{-1}}{2h}\\right) = -\\phi_0 $$\n    $$ \\phi_{+1} - \\phi_{-1} = -\\frac{2h}{\\delta}\\phi_0 $$\n    Isolating $\\phi_{+1}$, we obtain the expression for the ghost node value under the extrapolated boundary condition:\n    $$ \\phi_{+1} = \\phi_{-1} - \\frac{2h}{\\delta}\\phi_0 $$\n\nThe two derived formulas express the ghost node flux $\\phi_{+1}$ in terms of the interior flux $\\phi_{-1}$, the boundary flux $\\phi_{0}$, the mesh spacing $h$, and the extrapolation length $\\delta$, as required.\n\nThe final answer consists of these two expressions arranged in a row matrix.",
