            "problem": "A homogeneous infinite medium contains a dilute absorber with a single, isolated, narrow resonance at energy $E_0$, embedded in a moderator whose elastic scattering produces a slowing-down flux that is nearly constant per unit lethargy. Let the microscopic absorption cross section of the absorber in the neighborhood of $E_0$ be $\\sigma_a(E,T)$, which is broadened by the thermal motion of the target nuclei (the Doppler effect) at temperature $T$. Assume the following well-established facts as the starting point: (i) the absorption rate density can be written as $R(T)=N\\int_0^\\infty \\phi(E,T)\\,\\sigma_a(E,T)\\,\\mathrm{d}E$, where $N$ is the absorber number density and $\\phi(E,T)$ is the neutron flux; (ii) target-motion broadening can be represented as a convolution that conserves the resonance area in energy, i.e., $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\sigma_a(E,T)\\,\\mathrm{d}E=A$ independent of $T$ for an isolated resonance; and (iii) in an absorptionless slowing-down spectrum, the unperturbed flux per unit lethargy is nearly constant, implying $\\phi_0(E)\\propto 1/E$ across a narrow resonance.\n\nConsider the two idealized limits for the absorber resonance:\n\n- Infinitely dilute limit: $N\\to 0$, so that the flux is unperturbed by the absorber, $\\phi(E,T)\\approx \\phi_0(E)$ across the resonance.\n\n- Highly self-shielded limit: the macroscopic total cross section in the resonance region is dominated by the absorber, $\\Sigma_t(E,T)\\approx N\\,\\sigma_a(E,T)+\\Sigma_{\\text{bg}}$, with $\\Sigma_{\\text{bg}}$ weak and slowly varying in $E$ compared to $N\\,\\sigma_a(E,T)$; flux depression in the resonance can be approximated as $\\phi(E,T)\\propto 1/\\Sigma_t(E,T)$.\n\nBased on these assumptions and without invoking any shortcut formulas for the Doppler coefficient, which of the following statements best describes the sign and physical origin of $\\partial R/\\partial T$ in each limit, and consequently explains why the Doppler temperature effect vanishes in one limit but not the other?\n\nA. In the infinitely dilute limit, $\\partial R/\\partial T\\approx 0$ because $\\phi(E)$ is smooth across the resonance and the area $\\int\\sigma_a(E,T)\\,\\mathrm{d}E$ is conserved; in the highly self-shielded limit, $\\partial R/\\partial T>0$ because broadening redistributes cross section into energies where $\\phi(E)$ is less depressed, increasing effective absorption and thereby producing a negative Doppler temperature coefficient of reactivity.\n\nB.

            "solution": "The user wants me to validate the problem statement and, if valid, derive the solution and evaluate the given options.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\nThe problem provides the following information and assumptions:\n1.  The system is a homogeneous infinite medium.\n2.  It contains a dilute absorber with a single, isolated, narrow resonance at energy $E_0$.\n3.  A moderator produces a slowing-down flux that is nearly constant per unit lethargy.\n4.  The microscopic absorption cross section, $\\sigma_a(E,T)$, is a function of energy $E$ and temperature $T$ and is subject to Doppler broadening.\n5.  The absorption rate density is given by $R(T)=N\\int_0^\\infty \\phi(E,T)\\,\\sigma_a(E,T)\\,\\mathrm{d}E$, where $N$ is the absorber number density and $\\phi(E,T)$ is the neutron flux.\n6.  The resonance area is conserved with temperature: $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\sigma_a(E,T)\\,\\mathrm{d}E=A$, where $A$ is a constant.\n7.  The unperturbed flux from slowing down is $\\phi_0(E)\\propto 1/E$ across the narrow resonance.\n8.  Two idealized limits are considered:\n    *   **Infinitely dilute limit:** $N\\to 0$, leading to an unperturbed flux, $\\phi(E,T)\\approx \\phi_0(E)$.\n    *   **Highly self-shielded limit:** The macroscopic total cross section is $\\Sigma_t(E,T)\\approx N\\,\\sigma_a(E,T)+\\Sigma_{\\text{bg}}$, where $\\Sigma_{\\text{bg}}$ is weak and slowly varying. The flux is depressed according to $\\phi(E,T)\\propto 1/\\Sigma_t(E,T)$.\n\nThe task is to determine the sign and physical origin of $\\partial R/\\partial T$ in each limit.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n*   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly rooted in the principles of nuclear reactor physics. The concepts of resonance absorption, Doppler broadening, self-shielding (flux depression), the $1/E$ slowing-down spectrum, and the conservation of resonance area are standard and fundamental to the analysis of reactor temperature coefficients. The formulation is a well-established pedagogical model to explain the Doppler effect on reactivity.\n*   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides two distinct, well-defined physical limits and sufficient information (approximations for flux in each limit) to qualitatively evaluate the behavior of the absorption rate $R(T)$ and its derivative with respect to temperature, $\\partial R/\\partial T$. A unique conceptual answer can be derived.\n*   **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n*   **Completeness and Consistency:** The setup is self-contained and consistent. The assumptions provided are the standard starting points for an introductory derivation of the Doppler effect in these limits. No contradictions are present.\n*   **Feasibility:** The scenario, while idealized (infinite medium, single resonance), is a standard and physically meaningful simplification used in reactor theory.\n*   **Other Flaws:** The problem is not trivial, tautological, or ill-structured. It tests a core physical concept in reactor safety analysis.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is **valid**. We may proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation\n\nThe central quantity is the absorption rate density, $R(T)$, defined as:\n$$R(T) = N \\int_0^{\\infty} \\phi(E,T) \\sigma_a(E,T) \\, \\mathrm{d}E$$\nWe are asked to analyze the sign of its temperature derivative, $\\partial R/\\partial T$, in two limits.\n\n**Case 1: The Infinitely Dilute Limit**\n\nIn this limit, the absorber concentration $N \\to 0$. The absorber is so dilute that it does not perturb the neutron flux from its background slowing-down distribution.\nThe assumptions for this limit are:\n1.  $\\phi(E,T) \\approx \\phi_0(E)$.\n2.  $\\phi_0(E) \\propto 1/E$.\n\nThe absorption rate density becomes:\n$$R(T) = N \\int_0^{\\infty} \\phi_0(E) \\sigma_a(E,T) \\, \\mathrm{d}E$$\nSince the resonance is stated to be narrow, the flux $\\phi_0(E)$ varies very little over the energy range where $\\sigma_a(E,T)$ is non-negligible. We can therefore approximate $\\phi_0(E)$ as constant across the resonance, equal to its value at the resonance energy, $E_0$.\n$$\\phi_0(E) \\approx \\phi_0(E_0) \\text{ for } E \\approx E_0$$\nSubstituting this into the integral for $R(T)$:\n$$R(T) \\approx N \\phi_0(E_0) \\int_0^{\\infty} \\sigma_a(E,T) \\, \\mathrm{d}E$$\nThe problem states that the area under the resonance is conserved with temperature, i.e., $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\sigma_a(E,T) \\, \\mathrm{d}E = A$, where $A$ is a constant independent of $T$. (The integral limits can be extended to $(-\\infty, \\infty)$ or taken as $(0, \\infty)$ since $\\sigma_a$ is only significant for $E>0$ around $E_0$).\nTherefore, the absorption rate is approximately:\n$$R(T) \\approx N \\phi_0(E_0) A$$\nThis expression is independent of temperature $T$. Consequently, the derivative with respect to temperature is zero:\n$$\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial T} \\approx 0$$\nPhysically, Doppler broadening changes the shape of $\\sigma_a(E,T)$ by lowering its peak and widening its base, but it conserves the total area under the curve. In the infinitely dilute limit, the flux is smooth and unaffected by the absorber. The total absorption rate is proportional to the integral of the cross-section, which is constant. Thus, there is no change in the absorption rate with temperature. The Doppler effect on absorption vanishes in this limit.\n\n**Case 2: The Highly Self-Shielded Limit**\n\nIn this limit, the absorber concentration $N$ is large enough that the resonance causes significant flux depression. This phenomenon is called self-shielding.\nThe assumptions for this limit are:\n1.  $\\Sigma_t(E,T) \\approx N \\sigma_a(E,T) + \\Sigma_{\\text{bg}}$, where $N \\sigma_a(E,T)$ dominates near the resonance peak.\n2.  The flux is inversely proportional to the total macroscopic cross section: $\\phi(E,T) \\propto 1/\\Sigma_t(E,T)$.\n\nLet's write this as $\\phi(E,T) = C/\\Sigma_t(E,T)$, where $C$ is a constant related to the slowing-down density. The absorption rate is:\n$$R(T) = N \\int_0^{\\infty} \\phi(E,T) \\sigma_a(E,T) \\, \\mathrm{d}E = N \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{C}{\\Sigma_t(E,T)} \\sigma_a(E,T) \\, \\mathrm{d}E$$\n$$R(T) = C \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{N \\sigma_a(E,T)}{N \\sigma_a(E,T) + \\Sigma_{\\text{bg}}} \\, \\mathrm{d}E$$\nLet's analyze the integrand. Doppler broadening, caused by increasing temperature $T$, lowers the peak of $\\sigma_a(E,T)$ and increases its value in the \"wings\" (the region away from the resonance center $E_0$).\n\n*   **At the resonance peak ($E \\approx E_0$)**: The cross section $\\sigma_a(E,T)$ is very large, so $N \\sigma_a(E,T) \\gg \\Sigma_{\\text{bg}}$. Here, the flux $\\phi(E,T)$ is severely depressed (self-shielded). The product $\\phi(E,T) \\sigma_a(E,T) \\approx \\frac{C}{N \\sigma_a(E,T)} \\sigma_a(E,T) = C/N$. The absorption rate density per unit energy is \"saturated\".\n*   **In the resonance wings**: The cross section $\\sigma_a(E,T)$ is small. The flux is much less depressed and approaches the unperturbed value, $\\phi(E,T) \\approx C/\\Sigma_{\\text{bg}}$.\n\nAs temperature $T$ increases, Doppler broadening redistributes the cross section. It takes area from the peak and moves it to the wings.\n*   The reduction of $\\sigma_a$ at the peak occurs where the flux is already heavily depressed. Because the absorption is saturated, this has a relatively small effect on the overall absorption rate.\n*   The increase of $\\sigma_a$ in the wings occurs where the flux is much higher (less self-shielding).\n\nMore formally, broadening moves cross-section from an energy region where the self-shielding factor, $f_{sh} = \\phi/\\phi_0$, is very small to an energy region where $f_{sh}$ is closer to 1. The net result is that the broadened resonance \"sees\" a higher effective flux. This increases the total absorption rate $R(T)$. Therefore:\n$$\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial T} > 0$$\nThis increase in parasitic resonance absorption with temperature means fewer neutrons are available to sustain the chain reaction (i.e., fewer neutrons slow down to thermal energies to cause fission). An increase in absorption leads to a decrease in reactivity, $\\rho$. Thus, a positive $\\partial R/\\partial T$ results in a negative Doppler temperature coefficient of reactivity ($\\partial \\rho/\\partial T < 0$), a crucial inherent safety feature in nuclear reactors.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In the infinitely dilute limit, $\\partial R/\\partial T\\approx 0$ because $\\phi(E)$ is smooth across the resonance and the area $\\int\\sigma_a(E,T)\\,\\mathrm{d}E$ is conserved; in the highly self-shielded limit, $\\partial R/\\partial T>0$ because broadening redistributes cross section into energies where $\\phi(E)$ is less depressed, increasing effective absorption and thereby producing a negative Doppler temperature coefficient of reactivity.**\nThis statement accurately reflects our derivation for both limits.\n*   For the dilute limit, it correctly states $\\partial R/\\partial T \\approx 0$ and gives the correct reason: the combination of a smooth (unperturbed) flux and conserved cross-section area.\n*   For the self-shielded limit, it correctly states $\\partial R/\\partial T > 0$ and provides the correct physical mechanism: redistribution of cross section out of the self-shielded peak into the higher-flux wings. It also correctly connects this to negative reactivity feedback.\n*   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. In the infinitely dilute limit, $\\partial R/\\partial T$ is largest in magnitude because the flux is unshielded and directly samples the reduced peak of $\\sigma_a$; in the highly self-shielded limit, $\\partial R/\\partial T\\approx 0$ because flux depression cancels any change in $\\sigma_a$.**\nThis statement is incorrect for both limits.\n*   In the dilute limit, $\\partial R/\\partial T$ is nearly zero, not largest in magnitude.\n*   In the self-shielded limit, $\\partial R/\\partial T$ is positive, not zero. Flux depression is the *reason* for the effect, it does not cause a cancellation.\n*   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. In both limits, $\\partial R/\\partial T<0$ because Doppler broadening reduces the peak value of $\\sigma_a(E,T)$, so the resonance integral necessarily decreases with temperature regardless of flux behavior.**\nThis statement is incorrect.\n*   $\\partial R/\\partial T$ is not negative in either limit as derived.\n*   The reasoning is flawed, as it only considers the reduction in the peak and ignores the widening of the resonance and the crucial role of the flux profile. The effective resonance integral in the self-shielded case *increases* with temperature.\n*   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. In the infinitely dilute limit, $\\partial R/\\partial T>0$ because a broader $\\sigma_a(E,T)$ overlaps more of the $1/E$ slowing-down spectrum; in the highly self-shielded limit, $\\partial R/\\partial T\\approx 0$ because the flux adapts inversely with $\\sigma_a(E,T)$ so that $R(T)$ remains constant.**\nThis statement is incorrect for both limits.\n*   In the dilute limit, $\\partial R/\\partial T \\approx 0$. The argument about overlapping more of the $1/E$ spectrum is a very small, second-order effect, while the dominant effect described in the problem (constant flux across a narrow resonance) leads to a zero change.\n*   In the self-shielded limit, $\\partial R/\\partial T > 0$, not approximately zero.\n*   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Neither limit exhibits a Doppler effect on reactivity because reactivity depends only on thermal absorption, not on resonance absorption, so $\\partial R/\\partial T=0$ in both limits.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed.\n*   Reactivity depends on the overall neutron balance, including all production and loss mechanisms. Resonance absorption is a major neutron loss term, and changes in it directly affect reactivity.\n*   The premise that reactivity depends only on thermal absorption is false.\n*   **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

The reaction rate per unit volume is given by\n$$ R(T_{f}) = \\int_{E_{th}}^{E_{f}} \\Sigma_{a}(E, T_f) \\phi(E, T_f) dE $$\nwhere $\\Sigma_{a}(E, T_f) = N_f \\sigma_a(E, T_f)$ is the macroscopic absorption cross section of the fuel and $\\phi(E, T_f)$ is the neutron flux.\n\nThe unperturbed flux is $\\phi_{unp}(E) = C/E$ for some constant $C$. The problem states that epithermal self-shielding is represented by a local flux depression factor. This means the actual flux $\\phi(E, T_f)$ is the unperturbed flux modified by this factor. Assuming the proportionality constant is unity (as it would cancel in the final ratio), the self-shielded flux is:\n$$ \\phi(E, T_f) = \\phi_{unp}(E) \\frac{\\Sigma_b}{\\Sigma_b + \\Sigma_a(E, T_f)} = \\frac{C}{E} \\frac{\\Sigma_b}{\\Sigma_b + \\Sigma_a(E, T_f)} $$\nThe contribution to the reaction rate from the single isolated resonance, $R_{res}(T_f)$, is obtained by integrating over the energy range of the resonance:\n$$ R_{res}(T_f) = \\int_{res} \\Sigma_a(E, T_f) \\left( \\frac{C}{E} \\frac{\\Sigma_b}{\\Sigma_b + \\Sigma_a(E, T_f)} \\right) dE $$\nUsing the narrow resonance approximation, the $1/E$ term is treated as constant across the resonance, i.e., $1/E \\approx 1/E_r$.\n$$ R_{res}(T_f) \\approx \\frac{C}{E_r} \\int_{res} \\frac{\\Sigma_a(E, T_f) \\Sigma_b}{\\Sigma_b + \\Sigma_a(E, T_f)} dE $$\nThe microscopic cross section $\\sigma_a(E, T_f)$ is modeled as a rectangular function of height $h(T_f)$ and width $w(T_f)$ centered at $E_r$. Thus, the macroscopic cross section $\\Sigma_a(E, T_f)$ is also a rectangular function within the resonance:\n$$ \\Sigma_a(E, T_f) = \\Sigma_{a,peak}(T_f) = N_f h(T_f) \\times 10^{-24} \\quad \\text{for } E \\in [E_r - w(T_f)/2, E_r + w(T_f)/2] $$\nand $\\Sigma_a(E, T_f) = 0$ outside this interval.\nSince the integrand is constant over the width of the resonance, the integral becomes the value of the integrand multiplied by the width $w(T_f)$:\n$$ R_{res}(T_f) \\approx \\frac{C}{E_r} \\left( \\frac{\\Sigma_{a,peak}(T_f) \\Sigma_b}{\\Sigma_b + \\Sigma_{a,peak}(T_f)} \\right) w(T_f) $$\nWe are asked to find the ratio $R(T_1)/R(T_0)$, which is equivalent to $R_{res}(T_1)/R_{res}(T_0)$. The constant factor $C/E_r$ will cancel out.\n$$ \\frac{R(T_1)}{R(T_0)} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{\\Sigma_{a,peak}(T_1) \\Sigma_b}{\\Sigma_b + \\Sigma_{a,peak}(T_1)} \\right) w(T_1)}{\\left( \\frac{\\Sigma_{a,peak}(T_0) \\Sigma_b}{\\Sigma_b + \\Sigma_{a,peak}(T_0)} \\right) w(T_0)} $$\nThe dependencies on temperature are given as $w(T_f) \\propto \\sqrt{T_f}$ and $h(T_f) \\propto 1/\\sqrt{T_f}$. Let's express these relative to the reference temperature $T_0$.\n$$ w(T_f) = w(T_0) \\sqrt{\\frac{T_f}{T_0}} $$\n$$ h(T_f) = h(T_0) \\sqrt{\\frac{T_0}{T_f}} $$\nFrom this, the peak macroscopic cross section dependence is:\n$$ \\Sigma_{a,peak}(T_f) = N_f h(T_f) \\times 10^{-24} = \\left( N_f h(T_0) \\times 10^{-24} \\right) \\sqrt{\\frac{T_0}{T_f}} = \\Sigma_{a,peak}(T_0) \\sqrt{\\frac{T_0}{T_f}} $$\nLet's define a dimensionless parameter $\\gamma = \\sqrt{T_1/T_0}$ and another dimensionless parameter $\\beta_0 = \\Sigma_{a,peak}(T_0) / \\Sigma_b$.\nThen, $w(T_1) = w(T_0)\\gamma$ and $\\Sigma_{a,peak}(T_1) = \\Sigma_{a,peak}(T_0)/\\gamma = \\beta_0 \\Sigma_b / \\gamma$.\n\nSubstitute these into the ratio expression:\nNumerator term:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\Sigma_{a,peak}(T_1)}{\\Sigma_b + \\Sigma_{a,peak}(T_1)} \\right) w(T_1) = \\left( \\frac{\\beta_0 \\Sigma_b / \\gamma}{\\Sigma_b + \\beta_0 \\Sigma_b / \\gamma} \\right) w(T_0)\\gamma = \\left( \\frac{\\beta_0 / \\gamma}{1 + \\beta_0 / \\gamma} \\right) w(T_0)\\gamma = \\left( \\frac{\\beta_0}{\\gamma + \\beta_0} \\right) w(T_0)\\gamma $$\nDenominator term:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\Sigma_{a,peak}(T_0)}{\\Sigma_b + \\Sigma_{a,peak}(T_0)} \\right) w(T_0) = \\left( \\frac{\\beta_0 \\Sigma_b}{\\Sigma_b + \\beta_0 \\Sigma_b} \\right) w(T_0) = \\left( \\frac{\\beta_0}{1 + \\beta_0} \\right) w(T_0) $$\nThe ratio becomes:\n$$ \\frac{R(T_1)}{R(T_0)} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{\\gamma \\beta_0}{\\gamma + \\beta_0} \\right) w(T_0)}{\\left( \\frac{\\beta_0}{1 + \\beta_0} \\right) w(T_0)} = \\frac{\\gamma \\beta_0}{\\gamma + \\beta_0} \\cdot \\frac{1 + \\beta_0}{\\beta_0} = \\frac{\\gamma(1 + \\beta_0)}{\\gamma + \\beta_0} $$\nThis is the final symbolic expression for the ratio.

            "solution": "The objective is to construct and implement a self-contained numerical experiment to isolate the Doppler temperature feedback effect in fuel from the moderator density feedback effect in a simplified infinite-medium reactor model. This experiment emulates a common technique in advanced reactor simulation codes, where the effects of different physical phenomena are separated by selectively perturbing temperatures in the nuclear data versus the material properties. The analysis relies on the four-factor formula for an infinite, homogeneous medium.\n\nThe infinite-medium multiplication factor, $k_{\\infty}$, is given by the product of four factors:\n$$k_{\\infty} = \\eta \\, \\varepsilon \\, p \\, f$$\nwhere $\\eta$ is the reproduction factor, $\\varepsilon$ is the fast fission factor, $p$ is the resonance escape probability, and $f$ is the thermal utilization factor. Within this problem's framework, $\\eta$ and $\\varepsilon$ are treated as constants. The temperature dependence is isolated into $p$, which depends on the fuel's nuclear data temperature $T_{\\mathrm{fuel\\_data}}$, and $f$, which depends on the moderator's physical material temperature $T_{\\mathrm{mod\\_mat}}$. This separation is the key to the numerical experiment:\n$$k_{\\infty}(T_{\\mathrm{fuel\\_data}}, T_{\\mathrm{mod\\_mat}}) = \\eta \\, \\varepsilon \\, p(T_{\\mathrm{fuel\\_data}}) \\, f(T_{\\mathrm{mod\\_mat}})$$\n\nThe algorithm is structured as follows:\nFirst, we define a set of functions that model the physical behavior of each component according to the problem statement.\n\nThe resonance escape probability, $p$, is modeled as a function of the fuel data temperature $T_{\\mathrm{fuel\\_data}}$. An increase in fuel temperature broadens the resonant absorption peaks in fuel isotopes like $^{238}\\mathrm{U}$ (Doppler broadening), which increases the likelihood that a neutron is captured while slowing down, thereby decreasing the probability of it reaching thermal energies. This is modeled by:\n$$p(T_{\\mathrm{fuel\\_data}}) = p_0 \\, \\exp\\!\\left(-a_D \\left[\\sqrt{\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{fuel\\_data}}}{T_0}} - 1\\right]\\right)$$\nwhere $p_0$ is the resonance escape probability at a reference temperature $T_0$, and $a_D$ is a coefficient controlling the strength of this effect.\n\nThe thermal utilization factor, $f$, is the fraction of thermal neutrons absorbed in the fuel versus the total thermal absorptions in the reactor core. It depends on the macroscopic absorption cross sections, $\\Sigma_a$, of the fuel and moderator. While the fuel's cross section $\\Sigma_{a,\\mathrm{fuel}}^{\\mathrm{th}}$ is assumed constant, the moderator's cross section $\\Sigma_{a,\\mathrm{mod}}^{\\mathrm{th}}$ varies with temperature due to density changes. The model is:\n$$f(T_{\\mathrm{mod\\_mat}}) = \\frac{\\Sigma_{a,\\mathrm{fuel}}^{\\mathrm{th}}}{\\Sigma_{a,\\mathrm{fuel}}^{\\mathrm{th}} + \\Sigma_{a,\\mathrm{mod}}^{\\mathrm{th}}(T_{\\mathrm{mod\\_mat}})}$$\nThe moderator's macroscopic cross section is proportional to its number density, which is modeled using a linear thermal expansion law:\n$$\\rho_{\\mathrm{mod}}(T) = \\rho_{\\mathrm.mod}(T_0)\\,\\left[1 - \\beta \\,(T - T_0)\\right]$$\n$$\\Sigma_{a,\\mathrm{mod}}^{\\mathrm{th}}(T) = \\Sigma_{a,\\mathrm{mod},0}^{\\mathrm{th}} \\, \\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{mod}}(T)}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{mod}}(T_0)}$$\nwhere $\\beta$ is the volumetric thermal expansion coefficient and $T_0$ is the reference temperature.\n\nWith these components, we can compute $k_{\\infty}$ for any pair of $(T_{\\mathrm{fuel\\_data}}, T_{\\mathrm{mod\\_mat}})$. Reactivity, $\\rho$, is subsequently calculated from $k_{\\infty}$:\n$$\\rho = \\frac{k_{\\infty} - 1}{k_{\\infty}}$$\nThe temperature coefficients of reactivity are then computed using finite differences. The Doppler coefficient $\\alpha_D$ is found by perturbing only $T_{\\mathrm{fuel\\_data}}$ by $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{fuel\\_data}}$ while keeping $T_{\\mathrm{mod\\_mat}}$ constant. The moderator coefficient $\\alpha_M$ is found by perturbing only $T_{\\mathrm{mod\\_mat}}$ by $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{mod\\_mat}}$ while keeping $T_{\\mathrm{fuel\\_data}}$ constant. The results are converted to units of per cent mille per Kelvin (pcm/K) by multiplying by $10^5$.\n$$\\alpha_D = \\frac{\\rho(T_{\\mathrm{fuel\\_data}}+ \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{fuel\\_data}}, \\, T_{\\mathrm{mod\\_mat}}) - \\rho(T_{\\mathrm{fuel\\_data}}, \\, T_{\\mathrm{mod\\_mat}})}{\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{fuel\\_data}}} \\times 10^5$$\n$$\\alpha_M = \\frac{\\rho(T_{\\mathrm{fuel\\_data}}, \\, T_{\\mathrm{mod\\_mat}}+ \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{mod\\_mat}}) - \\rho(T_{\\mathrm{fuel\\_data}}, \\, T_{\\mathrm{mod\\_mat}})}{\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{mod\\_mat}}} \\times 10^5$$\n\nTo verify the isolation of effects, we compute the changes in $k_{\\infty}$ from individual and combined perturbations. The change from only the Doppler effect is $\\Delta k_D$, and from only the moderator effect is $\\Delta k_M$:\n$$\\Delta k_D = k_{\\infty}(T_{\\mathrm{fuel\\_data}}+\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{fuel\\_data}}, T_{\\mathrm{mod\\_mat}}) - k_{\\infty}(T_{\\mathrm{fuel\\_data}}, T_{\\mathrm{mod\\_mat}})$$\n$$\\Delta k_M = k_{\\infty}(T_{\\mathrm{fuel\\_data}}, T_{\\mathrm{mod\\_mat}}+\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{mod\\_mat}}) - k_{\\infty}(T_{\\mathrm{fuel\\_data}}, T_{\\mathrm{mod\\_mat}})$$\nThe total change when both temperatures are perturbed is $\\Delta k_{\\mathrm{both}}$. A key diagnostic is the non-additive cross-term, $X$, which measures the degree of coupling or non-linearity in the system's response:\n$$\\Delta k_{\\mathrm{both}} = k_{\\infty}(T_{\\mathrm{fuel\\_data}}+\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{fuel\\_data}}, T_{\\mathrm{mod\\_mat}}+\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{mod\\_mat}}) - k_{\\infty}(T_{\\mathrm{fuel\\_data}}, T_{\\mathrm{mod\\_mat}})$$\n$$X = \\left|\\Delta k_{\\mathrm{both}} - \\left(\\Delta k_D + \\Delta k_M\\right)\\right|$$\nSince $k_{\\infty}$ is a product of functions of the two temperatures, $k_{\\infty} \\propto p(T_{\\mathrm{fuel\\_data}}) \\cdot f(T_{\\mathrm{mod\\_mat}})$, the combined effect is not purely additive. The term $X$ quantifies this non-additivity. Analytically, one can show that $X = |\\eta \\varepsilon \\cdot \\Delta p \\cdot \\Delta f|$, where $\\Delta p$ and $\\Delta f$ are the changes in the respective factors. The isolation is considered successful if $X$ is below a small threshold $\\tau$, indicating that for the given perturbations, the total effect is well approximated by the sum of individual effects. This condition, $X < \\tau$, defines the boolean diagnostic $\\text{isolation\\_ok}$.\n\nThis entire procedure is implemented in the provided code, which systematically evaluates the model for three distinct test cases, calculates the six specified diagnostic quantities for each, and reports the flattened list of results.",
