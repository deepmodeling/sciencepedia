There are no internal contradictions. For example, the definition of MTC is standard, and the models for material properties are consistent with the assumptions.\n- **Realism:** While a highly idealized model (infinite, one-group, no leakage, no Doppler), it serves as a valid theoretical exercise to isolate a specific physical effect (moderator density feedback).

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in nuclear reactor physics. I will proceed with the detailed solution.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the Moderator Temperature Coefficient (MTC), $\\alpha_m$, and then compute the ratio of the MTC for light water to that for heavy water.\n\nThe MTC is defined as the derivative of reactivity $\\rho$ with respect to the moderator temperature $T_m$, evaluated at the reference temperature $T_0$:\n$$\n\\alpha_m = \\left.\\dfrac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial T_m}\\right|_{T_m=T_0}\n$$\nThe reactivity $\\rho$ is given by:\n$$\n\\rho(T_m) = \\dfrac{k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(T_m) - 1}{k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(T_m)} = 1 - \\dfrac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(T_m)}\n$$\nThe effective multiplication factor $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ for this infinite, homogeneous system is given as:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{eff}}(T_m) = \\dfrac{\\nu \\Sigma_{f,F}(T_m)}{\\Sigma_{a,F}(T_m) + \\Sigma_{a,m}(T_m)}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for reactivity yields:\n$$\n\\rho(T_m) = 1 - \\dfrac{\\Sigma_{a,F}(T_m) + \\Sigma_{a,m}(T_m)}{\\nu \\Sigma_{f,F}(T_m)}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given temperature-dependent expressions for the macroscopic cross sections:\n$$\n\\rho(T_m) = 1 - \\dfrac{\\Sigma_{a,F,0} \\sqrt{\\dfrac{T_0}{T_m}} + \\Sigma_{a,m,0}\\left[1 - \\alpha_v \\left(T_m - T_0\\right)\\right]\\sqrt{\\dfrac{T_0}{T_m}}}{\\nu \\Sigma_{f,0} \\sqrt{\\dfrac{T_0}{T_m}}}\n$$\nThe term $\\sqrt{\\dfrac{T_0}{T_m}}$, which represents the effect of the thermal neutron spectrum shift on the $1/v$ cross sections, is a common factor in both the numerator and the denominator. It can therefore be cancelled. This cancellation is a direct consequence of the assumption that all relevant cross sections (fuel absorption, fuel fission, and moderator absorption) follow the same $1/v$ behavior.\n$$\n\\rho(T_m) = 1 - \\dfrac{\\Sigma_{a,F,0} + \\Sigma_{a,m,0}\\left[1 - \\alpha_v \\left(T_m - T_0\\right)\\right]}{\\nu \\Sigma_{f,0}}\n$$\nThis simplified expression for reactivity now only depends linearly on the moderator temperature $T_m$. We can expand the term in the numerator:\n$$\n\\rho(T_m) = 1 - \\dfrac{\\Sigma_{a,F,0} + \\Sigma_{a,m,0} - \\Sigma_{a,m,0}\\alpha_v T_m + \\Sigma_{a,m,0}\\alpha_v T_0}{\\nu \\Sigma_{f,0}}\n$$\nTo find the MTC, we differentiate $\\rho(T_m)$ with respect to $T_m$:\n$$\n\\dfrac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial T_m} = \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial T_m} \\left( 1 - \\dfrac{\\Sigma_{a,F,0} + \\Sigma_{a,m,0} - \\Sigma_{a,m,0}\\alpha_v T_m + \\Sigma_{a,m,0}\\alpha_v T_0}{\\nu \\Sigma_{f,0}} \\right)\n$$\nThe terms $\\Sigma_{a,F,0}$, $\\Sigma_{a,m,0}$, and $\\Sigma_{a,m,0}\\alpha_v T_0$ are all constant with respect to $T_m$. The derivative is therefore:\n$$\n\\dfrac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial T_m} = - \\dfrac{1}{\\nu \\Sigma_{f,0}} \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial T_m} \\left( - \\Sigma_{a,m,0}\\alpha_v T_m \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\dfrac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial T_m} = - \\dfrac{1}{\\nu \\Sigma_{f,0}} \\left( - \\Sigma_{a,m,0}\\alpha_v \\right) = \\dfrac{\\Sigma_{a,m,0}\\alpha_v}{\\nu \\Sigma_{f,0}}\n$$\nThe resulting expression for the derivative is a constant, independent of $T_m$. Therefore, evaluating it at $T_m = T_0$ does not change its value:\n$$\n\\alpha_m = \\left.\\dfrac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial T_m}\\right|_{T_m=T_0} = \\dfrac{\\Sigma_{a,m,0}\\alpha_v}{\\nu \\Sigma_{f,0}}\n$$\nThis analytical expression for $\\alpha_m$ isolates the contribution from moderator density changes, as intended by the problem statement.\n\nWe are asked to compute the ratio $R = \\dfrac{\\alpha_m^{\\mathrm{H_2O}}}{\\alpha_m^{\\mathrm{D_2O}}}$. Using the derived expression for $\\alpha_m$:\n$$\nR = \\dfrac{\\left(\\dfrac{\\Sigma_{a,m,0}^{\\mathrm{H_2O}}\\alpha_v^{\\mathrm{H_2O}}}{\\nu \\Sigma_{f,0}}\\right)}{\\left(\\dfrac{\\Sigma_{a,m,0}^{\\mathrm{D_2O}}\\alpha_v^{\\mathrm{D_2O}}}{\\nu \\Sigma_{f,0}}\\right)}\n$$\nThe fuel parameter $\\nu \\Sigma_{f,0}$ is common to both the numerator and the denominator and thus cancels out:\n$$\nR = \\dfrac{\\Sigma_{a,m,0}^{\\mathrm{H_2O}}\\alpha_v^{\\mathrm{H_2O}}}{\\Sigma_{a,m,0}^{\\mathrm{D_2O}}\\alpha_v^{\\mathrm{D_2O}}}\n$$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values:\n- For Light Water ($\\mathrm{H_2O}$): $\\Sigma_{a,m,0}^{\\mathrm{H_2O}} = 0.020 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $\\alpha_v^{\\mathrm{H_2O}} = 2.57 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n- For Heavy Water ($\\mathrm{D_2O}$): $\\Sigma_{a,m,0}^{\\mathrm{D_2O}} = 5.00 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $\\alpha_v^{\\mathrm{D_2O}} = 1.25 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n\n$$\nR = \\dfrac{(0.020) \\times (2.57 \\times 10^{-4})}{(5.00 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times (1.25 \\times 10^{-4})}\n$$\n$$\nR = \\dfrac{5.14 \\times 10^{-6}}{6.25 \\times 10^{-8}}\n$$\n$$\nR = \\dfrac{5.14}{6.25} \\times 10^{2} = 0.8224 \\times 100\n$$\n$$\nR = 82.24\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

You will develop a local linearization and a data-driven surrogate to estimate the moderator temperature coefficient $\\alpha_m$ at a nominal temperature $T_0 = 600~\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nThe dataset is\n- $T_m = 560~\\mathrm{K}$, $k_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 1.00320$,\n- $T_m = 580~\\mathrm{K}$, $k_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 1.00200$,\n- $T_m = 600~\\mathrm{K}$, $k_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 1.00080$,\n- $T_m = 620~\\mathrm{K}$, $k_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 0.99970$,\n- $T_m = 640~\\mathrm{K}$, $k_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 0.99870$.\n\nStarting from the eigenvalue definition of the effective multiplication factor in neutron transport and the definition of reactivity $\\rho$ in terms of $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, derive a local expression for the moderator temperature coefficient, defined as $\\alpha_m = \\left.\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial T_m}\\right|_{T_0}$, that depends only on $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and its temperature derivative evaluated at $T_0$.\n\nThen:\n- Using the five data points at $T_m \\in \\{560, 580, 600, 620, 640\\}~\\mathrm{K}$, estimate $\\left.\\frac{\\partial k_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{\\partial T_m}\\right|_{T_0}$ by applying a fourth-order accurate five-point centered finite difference with step $h = 20~\\mathrm{K}$.\n- Construct a local quadratic surrogate $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(T_m) \\approx a_0 + a_1 \\theta + a_2 \\theta^2$ with $\\theta = T_m - T_0$ by ordinary least squares over the five symmetric points $\\theta_i \\in \\{-40, -20, 0, 20, 40\\}~\\mathrm{K}$. Exploit the symmetry of the design to obtain a closed-form expression for $a_1$ in terms of sums of $\\theta_i$ and $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(T_m)$, and compute its numerical value. Interpret $a_1$ as the surrogate-based estimate of $\\left.\\frac{\\partial k_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{\\partial T_m}\\right|_{T_0}$.\n\nFinally, combine your derived expression for $\\alpha_m$ with the surrogate-based derivative to produce a single numerical estimate of the moderator temperature coefficient at $T_0$. Express the final answer in units of per kelvin ($\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$) and round your result to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for a derivation of an expression for the moderator temperature coefficient ($\\alpha_m$), the estimation of a derivative using two different numerical methods, and finally, the calculation of $\\alpha_m$ at a nominal temperature $T_0$.\n\nFirst, we address the derivation of the expression for the moderator temperature coefficient, $\\alpha_m$. Reactivity, $\\rho$, is defined in terms of the effective neutron multiplication factor, $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, as:\n$$ \\rho = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{eff}} - 1}{k_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = 1 - \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{eff}}} $$\nThe moderator temperature coefficient, $\\alpha_m$, is defined as the partial derivative of reactivity with respect to the moderator temperature, $T_m$. We compute this derivative using the chain rule:\n$$ \\alpha_m = \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial T_m} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T_m} \\left( 1 - k_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{-1} \\right) $$\n$$ \\alpha_m = 0 - (-1) k_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{-2} \\frac{\\partial k_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{\\partial T_m} = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{eff}}^2} \\frac{\\partial k_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{\\partial T_m} $$\nTo find the specific value of $\\alpha_m$ at the nominal temperature $T_0$, we evaluate this expression at $T_m = T_0$:\n$$ \\alpha_m(T_0) = \\left.\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial T_m}\\right|_{T_0} = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(T_0)^2} \\left.\\frac{\\partial k_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{\\partial T_m}\\right|_{T_0} $$\nThis expression depends only on $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and its temperature derivative, both evaluated at $T_0$, as required.\n\nNext, we estimate the derivative $\\left.\\frac{\\partial k_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{\\partial T_m}\\right|_{T_0}$ using the two specified methods. The nominal temperature is $T_0 = 600~\\mathrm{K}$, and the data points are given with a uniform step of $h = 20~\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nThe first method is the fourth-order accurate five-point centered finite difference formula. For a function $f(x)$ sampled at points $x_i = x_0 + i h$, the derivative at $x_0$ is approximated as:\n$$ f'(x_0) \\approx \\frac{f(x_0-2h) - 8f(x_0-h) + 8f(x_0+h) - f(x_0+2h)}{12h} $$\nApplying this to $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(T_m)$ at $T_0 = 600~\\mathrm{K}$ with $h = 20~\\mathrm{K}$:\n$$ \\left.\\frac{\\partial k_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{\\partial T_m}\\right|_{T_0} \\approx \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(560) - 8k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(580) + 8k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(620) - k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(640)}{12 \\times 20} $$\nSubstituting the given data:\n$k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(560) = 1.00320$\n$k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(580) = 1.00200$\n$k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(620) = 0.99970$\n$k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(640) = 0.99870$\n$$ \\left.\\frac{\\partial k_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{\\partial T_m}\\right|_{T_0} \\approx \\frac{1.00320 - 8(1.00200) + 8(0.99970) - 0.99870}{240} $$\n$$ \\left.\\frac{\\partial k_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{\\partial T_m}\\right|_{T_0} \\approx \\frac{1.00320 - 8.01600 + 7.99760 - 0.99870}{240} = \\frac{-0.0139}{240} \\approx -5.7917 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{K}^{-1} $$\n\nThe second method involves constructing a local quadratic surrogate model using ordinary least squares (OLS). Let $\\theta = T_m - T_0 = T_m - 600~\\mathrm{K}$. The model is $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(\\theta) \\approx a_0 + a_1 \\theta + a_2 \\theta^2$. The data points in terms of $\\theta$ are:\n- $\\theta_1 = -40~\\mathrm{K}$, $k_1 = 1.00320$\n- $\\theta_2 = -20~\\mathrm{K}$, $k_2 = 1.00200$\n- $\\theta_3 = 0~\\mathrm{K}$, $k_3 = 1.00080$\n- $\\theta_4 = 20~\\mathrm{K}$, $k_4 = 0.99970$\n- $\\theta_5 = 40~\\mathrm{K}$, $k_5 = 0.99870$\nThe OLS method minimizes the sum of squared residuals, $S = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} (k_i - (a_0 + a_1 \\theta_i + a_2 \\theta_i^2))^2$. The normal equations are obtained by setting the partial derivatives of $S$ with respect to $a_0, a_1, a_2$ to zero.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial a_1} = -2 \\sum_{i=1}^{5} \\theta_i (k_i - a_0 - a_1 \\theta_i - a_2 \\theta_i^2) = 0 $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{5} \\theta_i k_i = a_0 \\sum_{i=1}^{5} \\theta_i + a_1 \\sum_{i=1}^{5} \\theta_i^2 + a_2 \\sum_{i=1}^{5} \\theta_i^3 $$\nDue to the symmetry of the design points $\\theta_i = \\{-40, -20, 0, 20, 40\\}$ around zero, the sums of odd powers of $\\theta_i$ are zero:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{5} \\theta_i = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sum_{i=1}^{5} \\theta_i^3 = 0 $$\nThis simplifies the normal equation for $a_1$ to:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{5} \\theta_i k_i = a_1 \\sum_{i=1}^{5} \\theta_i^2 $$\nSolving for $a_1$ gives the requested closed-form expression:\n$$ a_1 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{5} \\theta_i k_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{5} \\theta_i^2} $$\nNow, we compute the numerical values of the sums:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{5} \\theta_i^2 = (-40)^2 + (-20)^2 + 0^2 + 20^2 + 40^2 = 1600 + 400 + 0 + 400 + 1600 = 4000~\\mathrm{K}^2 $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{5} \\theta_i k_i = (-40)(1.00320) + (-20)(1.00200) + (0)(1.00080) + (20)(0.99970) + (40)(0.99870) $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{5} \\theta_i k_i = -40.128 - 20.040 + 0 + 19.994 + 39.948 = -0.226 $$\nSubstituting these values, we find $a_1$:\n$$ a_1 = \\frac{-0.226}{4000~\\mathrm{K}^2} = -0.0000565~\\mathrm{K}^{-1} = -5.65 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{K}^{-1} $$\nTo interpret $a_1$, we differentiate the surrogate model with respect to $T_m$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial k_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{\\partial T_m} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T_m} (a_0 + a_1 \\theta + a_2 \\theta^2) = (a_1 + 2a_2\\theta) \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial T_m} $$\nSince $\\theta = T_m - T_0$, we have $\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial T_m} = 1$. Evaluating the derivative at $T_m = T_0$ (which corresponds to $\\theta = 0$):\n$$ \\left.\\frac{\\partial k_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{\\partial T_m}\\right|_{T_0} = a_1 + 2a_2(0) = a_1 $$\nThus, the coefficient $a_1$ is the surrogate-based estimate of the derivative of $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ with respect to $T_m$ at the nominal temperature $T_0$.\n\nFinally, we combine the derived expression for $\\alpha_m$ with the surrogate-based derivative estimate ($a_1$) to compute the moderator temperature coefficient.\n$$ \\alpha_m(T_0) = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(T_0)^2} \\left.\\frac{\\partial k_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{\\partial T_m}\\right|_{T_0} $$\nFrom the data, $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(T_0) = k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(600~\\mathrm{K}) = 1.00080$. The surrogate-based derivative is $a_1 = -5.65 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.\n$$ \\alpha_m(600~\\mathrm{K}) = \\frac{1}{(1.00080)^2} \\times (-5.65 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{K}^{-1}) $$\n$$ \\alpha_m(600~\\mathrm{K}) = \\frac{-5.65 \\times 10^{-5}}{1.00160064}~\\mathrm{K}^{-1} \\approx -5.641010 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{K}^{-1} $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives:\n$$ \\alpha_m(600~\\mathrm{K}) \\approx -5.641 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{K}^{-1} $$",
