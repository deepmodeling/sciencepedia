            "problem": "A Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) is operating at near-zero power with the core in a critical state. The core-average moderator temperature is initially $T_{m0} = 580\\ \\mathrm{K}$, and the reactivity at this state is $ \\rho_{0} = 0 $. In reactor physics, reactivity is defined by $ \\rho = (k_{\\mathrm{eff}} - 1)/k_{\\mathrm{eff}} $, where $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is the effective multiplication factor.

            "solution": "The problem is evaluated to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution. It is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe problem consists of two parts. The first part requires the derivation and calculation of the change in reactivity, $\\Delta\\rho$, due to a change in moderator temperature. The second part requires a qualitative discussion of the physical mechanisms governing the sign of the moderator temperature coefficient of reactivity, $\\alpha_m$.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Reactivity Change**\n\nThe reactivity, $\\rho$, is a function of the state of the reactor core, including the moderator temperature, $T_m$. The moderator temperature coefficient of reactivity, $\\alpha_m$, is defined as the partial derivative of reactivity with respect to the moderator temperature, evaluated at a specific state. In this problem, it is evaluated at the initial state ($T_{m0}$, $\\rho_0$).\n$$\n\\alpha_{m} = \\left.\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial T_{m}}\\right|_{T_{m0}}\n$$\nTo find a first-order expression for the change in reactivity, $\\Delta\\rho = \\rho(T_m) - \\rho(T_{m0})$, a first-order Taylor series expansion of the function $\\rho(T_m)$ around the initial temperature $T_{m0}$ is employed.\n$$\n\\rho(T_m) \\approx \\rho(T_{m0}) + \\left.\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial T_{m}}\\right|_{T_{m0}} (T_m - T_{m0})\n$$\nBy substituting the definition of $\\alpha_m$ and rearranging the terms, we obtain the expression for the change in reactivity, $\\Delta\\rho$.\n$$\n\\rho(T_m) - \\rho(T_{m0}) \\approx \\alpha_{m} (T_m - T_{m0})\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta\\rho \\approx \\alpha_{m} \\Delta T_{m}\n$$\nThis is the required first-order expression for the change in reactivity. It shows that for small changes in temperature, the change in reactivity is approximately linear.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $\\Delta\\rho$ using the provided data.\nThe givens are:\nInitial moderator temperature, $T_{m0} = 580\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\nFinal moderator temperature, $T_{m} = 592\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\nModerator temperature coefficient at $T_{m0}$, $\\alpha_{m} = -18\\ \\mathrm{pcm/K}$.\nOne percent mille, $1\\ \\mathrm{pcm} = 1 \\times 10^{-5}$ in dimensionless reactivity units.\n\nFirst, convert $\\alpha_m$ into dimensionless units per Kelvin.\n$$\n\\alpha_{m} = -18\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{pcm}}{\\mathrm{K}} = -18 \\times (1 \\times 10^{-5})\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1} = -1.8 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}\n$$\nNext, calculate the change in moderator temperature, $\\Delta T_m$.\n$$\n\\Delta T_{m} = T_m - T_{m0} = 592\\ \\mathrm{K} - 580\\ \\mathrm{K} = 12\\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$\nFinally, calculate the change in reactivity, $\\Delta\\rho$.\n$$\n\\Delta\\rho \\approx (-1.8 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}) \\times (12\\ \\mathrm{K})\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta\\rho \\approx -21.6 \\times 10^{-4} = -0.00216\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Therefore, the final numerical value is $-0.002160$. This negative change in reactivity indicates that the reactor has become subcritical as a result of the temperature increase, which is consistent with the negative sign of $\\alpha_m$.\n\n**Part 2: Physical Mechanisms for Sign Change of $\\alpha_m$**\n\nThe moderator temperature coefficient of reactivity, $\\alpha_m = \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial T_m}$, can change sign and become positive under certain conditions in a Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR). A positive $\\alpha_m$ represents a significant safety concern, as an increase in temperature would add positive reactivity, leading to a potential power excursion. The sign and magnitude of $\\alpha_m$ are determined by the net effect of several competing physical phenomena that are triggered by a change in moderator (water) density, $\\rho_w$, as temperature changes. For water in the typical operating range of a PWR, an increase in temperature, $T_m$, causes a decrease in density, $\\rho_w$.\n\nThe total derivative can be expressed using the chain rule as $\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial T_m} = \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial \\rho_w} \\frac{\\partial \\rho_w}{\\partial T_m}$. Since $\\frac{\\partial \\rho_w}{\\partial T_m}$ is always negative for water above $4^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$, the sign of $\\alpha_m$ is opposite to the sign of $\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial \\rho_w}$. The change in reactivity with respect to moderator density, $\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial \\rho_w}$, is the sum of three primary effects:\n\n1.  **Neutron Spectrum Hardening (Negative Reactivity Effect)**: The primary role of the water moderator is to slow down fast neutrons produced by fission to thermal energies, where the probability of causing another fission in $^{235}$U is much higher. A decrease in water density (due to increased $T_m$) reduces the number of hydrogen nuclei per unit volume, which impairs the moderating power of the coolant. Consequently, fewer neutrons are thermalized, and the average energy of the neutron population increases. This phenomenon is called spectrum hardening. For a typical low-enriched uranium fuel, this harder spectrum leads to a lower effective fission cross-section, reducing the thermal fission rate and thus inserting negative reactivity.\n\n2.  **Increased Neutron Leakage (Negative Reactivity Effect)**: The water in a PWR acts as both a moderator and a neutron reflector. A decrease in moderator density reduces the scattering cross-section of the core, increasing the mean free path for neutrons. This makes it more likely for neutrons to escape from the core volume entirely without being absorbed or causing fission. This increased neutron leakage represents a loss of neutrons from the chain reaction, thus contributing negative reactivity.\n\n3.  **Soluble Boron Density Change (Positive Reactivity Effect)**: To control excess reactivity over the fuel cycle, PWRs use boric acid ($\\text{H}_3\\text{BO}_3$) dissolved in the moderator. The isotope $^{10}\\text{B}$ is a very strong absorber of thermal neutrons. When the moderator temperature increases, the water expands and its density decreases. This expansion forces a certain amount of water, and with it the dissolved boron, out of the reactor core. The total number of boron atoms within the core volume is therefore reduced. This reduction in the concentration of a neutron poison leads to less parasitic absorption and thus inserts positive reactivity.\n\nThe moderator temperature coefficient, $\\alpha_m$, is the sum of these competing effects.\n$$\n\\alpha_m = (\\alpha_m)_{\\text{spectrum}} + (\\alpha_m)_{\\text{leakage}} + (\\alpha_m)_{\\text{boron}}\n$$\nwhere the spectrum and leakage components are negative, and the boron component is positive.\n\nThe coefficient $\\alpha_m$ can change sign and become positive if the positive reactivity insertion from the boron density effect is large enough to overcome the sum of the negative reactivity effects from spectrum hardening and increased leakage. This condition is most likely to occur under a specific set of circumstances:\n\n-   **High Soluble Boron Concentration**: The magnitude of the positive boron effect is directly proportional to the concentration of boric acid in the coolant. Boron concentration is highest at the beginning of a fuel cycle (BOC) to compensate for the high reactivity of fresh fuel. Therefore, the risk of a positive $\\alpha_m$ is greatest at BOC. As the fuel is depleted and the boron concentration is reduced (a process called boron letdown), the positive component of $\\alpha_m$ diminishes, making $\\alpha_m$ more negative.\n\n-   **Low Moderator Temperature**: The density of water is higher at lower temperatures. A reactor at zero-power, cold or hot-standby conditions, contains a higher inventory of coolant and thus a greater number of boron atoms in the core than at full-power operating temperatures. A temperature increase from this state will expel a larger absolute mass of water and boron, leading to a stronger positive reactivity effect. For this reason, regulatory limits on $\\alpha_m$ are particularly strict for zero-power physics testing conditions.\n\nIn summary, the competition between the negative reactivity feedback from spectral and leakage effects and the positive feedback from the reduction in soluble boron density determines the sign of $\\alpha_m$. A positive $\\alpha_m$ is most probable at the beginning of a fuel cycle when boron concentration is at its maximum, especially at lower moderator temperatures.",

A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe reactor dynamics are governed by the Point Kinetics Equations (PKE). The equation for the neutron population density $n(t)$ and for the concentration of the $i$-th group of delayed neutron precursors $C_i(t)$ are:\n$$\n\\frac{dn(t)}{dt} = \\frac{\\rho(t) - \\beta_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{\\Lambda} n(t) + \\sum_{i} \\lambda_i C_i(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dC_i(t)}{dt} = \\frac{\\beta_i}{\\Lambda} n(t) - \\lambda_i C_i(t)\n$$\nwhere $\\rho(t)$ is the reactivity, $\\lambda_i$ is the decay constant of the $i$-th precursor group, and $\\beta_i$ is the fraction of the $i$-th precursor group, with $\\beta_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\sum_i \\beta_i$.\n\nFirst, we establish the initial steady-state conditions for $t < 0$. The reactor is critical, so $\\rho(t<0) = 0$. The neutron population is constant, $n(t) = n_0$, which implies $\\frac{dn}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{dC_i}{dt} = 0$. From the precursor equation at steady state, we have:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{\\beta_i}{\\Lambda} n_0 - \\lambda_i C_i(0^-) \\implies \\lambda_i C_i(0^-) = \\frac{\\beta_i}{\\Lambda} n_0\n$$\nSumming over all precursor groups gives the total delayed neutron source at equilibrium:\n$$\n\\sum_i \\lambda_i C_i(0^-) = \\sum_i \\frac{\\beta_i}{\\Lambda} n_0 = \\frac{n_0}{\\Lambda} \\sum_i \\beta_i = \\frac{\\beta_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{\\Lambda} n_0\n$$\nThis result is consistent with the neutron population equation at steady state:\n$$\n\\frac{dn}{dt}\\bigg|_{t<0} = 0 = \\frac{0 - \\beta_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{\\Lambda} n_0 + \\sum_i \\lambda_i C_i(0^-) = \\frac{-\\beta_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{\\Lambda} n_0 + \\frac{\\beta_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{\\Lambda} n_0\n$$\nAt $t=0$, a step reactivity $\\Delta\\rho$ is inserted, so for $t \\ge 0$, $\\rho(t) = \\Delta\\rho$. The prompt jump is an idealized instantaneous response of the neutron population over an infinitesimal time interval from $t=0^-$ to $t=0^+$. This change is driven by prompt neutrons and occurs on a timescale of the order of $\\Lambda$ (microseconds). The core assumption, explicitly stated, is that the precursor concentrations do not have time to change during this jump because their governing time constants, $1/\\lambda_i$, are much longer (seconds). Thus, $C_i(0^+) = C_i(0^-)$, and consequently, the delayed neutron source term remains constant across the jump:\n$$\n\\sum_i \\lambda_i C_i(0^+) = \\sum_i \\lambda_i C_i(0^-) = \\frac{\\beta_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{\\Lambda} n_0\n$$\nThe neutron population equation at $t=0^+$ becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dn}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0^+} = \\frac{\\Delta\\rho - \\beta_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{\\Lambda} n(0^+) + \\sum_i \\lambda_i C_i(0^+) = \\frac{\\Delta\\rho - \\beta_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{\\Lambda} n(0^+) + \\frac{\\beta_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{\\Lambda} n_0\n$$\nThis can be rearranged to:\n$$\n\\Lambda \\frac{dn}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0^+} = (\\Delta\\rho - \\beta_{\\mathrm{eff}}) n(0^+) + \\beta_{\\mathrm{eff}} n_0\n$$\nThe prompt neutron generation time $\\Lambda$ is very small (here, $1.0\\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{s}$). For the derivative $\\frac{dn}{dt}$ to remain finite immediately after the jump (i.e., for the system to reach a temporary, quasi-stable state before the slower delayed neutron effects dominate), the right-hand side of the equation must be close to zero. The system adjusts $n(t)$ \"instantaneously\" to $n(0^+)$ to achieve this balance. This is the essence of the prompt jump approximation. Setting the right-hand side to zero gives:\n$$\n(\\Delta\\rho - \\beta_{\\mathrm{eff}}) n(0^+) + \\beta_{\\mathrm{eff}} n_0 = 0\n$$\nSolving for the post-jump population $n(0^+)$:\n$$\n(\\beta_{\\mathrm{eff}} - \\Delta\\rho) n(0^+) = \\beta_{\\mathrm{eff}} n_0\n$$\n$$\nn(0^+) = \\frac{\\beta_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{\\beta_{\\mathrm{eff}} - \\Delta\\rho} n_0\n$$\nThe prompt jump ratio $J$ is defined as $J = n(0^+) / n(0^-)$. Since $n(0^-) = n_0$, we have:\n$$\nJ = \\frac{n(0^+)}{n(0^-)} = \\frac{\\beta_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{\\beta_{\\mathrm{eff}} - \\Delta\\rho}\n$$\nThis expression is valid for sub-prompt critical reactivity insertions, i.e., $\\Delta\\rho < \\beta_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, which is the case here since $3.0\\times 10^{-3} < 6.5\\times 10^{-3}$.\n\nNow we evaluate $J$ using the given numerical values:\n$\\beta_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 6.5 \\times 10^{-3}$\n$\\Delta \\rho = 3.0 \\times 10^{-3}$\n$$\nJ = \\frac{6.5 \\times 10^{-3}}{6.5 \\times 10^{-3} - 3.0 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{6.5 \\times 10^{-3}}{3.5 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{6.5}{3.5} = \\frac{13}{7}\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value and rounding to four significant figures:\n$$\nJ \\approx 1.8571428... \\approx 1.857\n$$\n\nFinally, the conditions under which the prompt jump approximation fails are considered. The validity of the approximation rests on a clear separation of time scales: the prompt neutron dynamics (on the order of $\\Lambda$) must be much faster than any other process affecting reactivity or neutron population. The approximation fails when this separation breaks down. A primary mechanism for this is fast-acting reactivity feedback.\nFor example, the Doppler temperature coefficient of reactivity is a very fast feedback mechanism. The initial jump in neutron population $n(t)$ causes a near-instantaneous rise in fission rate and hence thermal power. This power is deposited directly into the fuel, causing its temperature to rise. In most thermal reactors, this temperature rise introduces negative reactivity via the Doppler effect (broadening of absorption resonances in materials like Uranium-238).\nThe feedback time constant can be very short, on the order of milliseconds or less. If this time constant is not significantly larger than $\\Lambda$, the feedback acts *during* the prompt jump itself. This violates the crucial assumption that the reactivity is a constant step $\\Delta\\rho$. Instead, the total reactivity becomes $\\rho(t) = \\Delta\\rho + \\rho_{\\mathrm{feedback}}(t)$, where $\\rho_{\\mathrm{feedback}}(t)$ is a rapidly developing negative function of temperature, which in turn is a function of the energy released, i.e., the integral of $n(t)$. The simple algebraic solution for the jump is no longer valid; instead, one must solve a coupled system of differential equations for neutronics and thermal-hydraulics. This inherent self-limiting feedback would cause the actual peak population reached to be lower than the value predicted by the simple prompt jump formula.",

The presence of the effective single delayed group decay constant, $\\lambda_{d}$, and the prompt neutron generation time, $\\Lambda$, although not required for the final algebraic calculation, are essential context for the reactor point kinetics model and do not invalidate the problem. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for three distinct items: the condition for prompt critical behavior, an algebraic expression for the required fuel temperature rise to meet this condition, and a numerical calculation of this temperature rise.\n\nFirst, we identify the condition that demarcates the onset of prompt critical behavior. In reactor physics, the total reactivity, $\\rho$, determines the rate of change of the neutron population. The effective delayed neutron fraction, $\\beta$, represents the fraction of fission neutrons that are born from the decay of fission products (delayed neutrons), as opposed to being born directly from fission (prompt neutrons).\n- If $\\rho < \\beta$, the reactor is said to be \"delayed supercritical.\" The chain reaction is sustained by both prompt and delayed neutrons, and the reactor power increases on a timescale governed by the delayed neutron precursors, which is relatively slow (seconds to minutes).\n- If $\\rho \\geq \\beta$, the reactor is said to be \"prompt critical.\" At the boundary $\\rho = \\beta$, the production of prompt neutrons alone is sufficient to sustain a new generation of fissions that is equal in size to the previous one. The reactor becomes critical on prompt neutrons alone, and the power increases extremely rapidly on a timescale dictated by the prompt neutron generation time, $\\Lambda$, which is typically on the order of microseconds to milliseconds.\nTherefore, the condition that demarcates the onset of prompt critical behavior is when the total instantaneous reactivity $\\rho(t)$ is equal to the effective delayed neutron fraction $\\beta$.\n$$\n\\rho(t) = \\beta\n$$\n\nSecond, we derive an algebraic expression for the minimum fuel temperature rise, $\\Delta T_{F}^{\\star}$, required for the net reactivity to reach this boundary.

The reactivity equation can be written as:\n$$\n\\rho(t) = \\rho_{0} + \\alpha_{F}\\Delta T_{F}(t) + \\alpha_{M}\\Delta T_{M}(t)\n$$\nThe problem states that on the prompt timescale, the moderator temperature rise tracks the fuel temperature rise according to the relation:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{M}(t) = \\eta \\Delta T_{F}(t)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the reactivity equation yields an expression for reactivity solely in terms of the fuel temperature rise:\n$$\n\\rho(t) = \\rho_{0} + \\alpha_{F}\\Delta T_{F}(t) + \\alpha_{M}\\left(\\eta \\Delta T_{F}(t)\\right)\n$$\nFactoring out the term $\\Delta T_{F}(t)$, we get:\n$$\n\\rho(t) = \\rho_{0} + \\left(\\alpha_{F} + \\eta\\alpha_{M}\\right)\\Delta T_{F}(t)\n$$\nThe initial reactivity insertion $\\rho_{0} = 8.0 \\times 10^{-3}$ is greater than $\\beta = 6.5 \\times 10^{-3}$, meaning the reactor is initially super-prompt-critical. The subsequent power rise causes the fuel temperature to increase, introducing negative reactivity feedback (since $\\alpha_F < 0$ and $\\alpha_M < 0$). This feedback reduces the total reactivity. We seek the fuel temperature rise, denoted $\\Delta T_{F}^{\\star}$, at the time $t^{\\star}$ when the reactivity has decreased to the prompt critical boundary, i.e., $\\rho(t^{\\star}) = \\beta$.\nSetting $\\rho(t^{\\star}) = \\beta$ and $\\Delta T_{F}(t^{\\star}) = \\Delta T_{F}^{\\star}$ in the equation above gives:\n$$\n\\beta = \\rho_{0} + \\left(\\alpha_{F} + \\eta\\alpha_{M}\\right) \\Delta T_{F}^{\\star}\n$$\nSolving for $\\Delta T_{F}^{\\star}$, we find:\n$$\n\\left(\\alpha_{F} + \\eta\\alpha_{M}\\right) \\Delta T_{F}^{\\star} = \\beta - \\rho_{0}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta T_{F}^{\\star} = \\frac{\\beta - \\rho_{0}}{\\alpha_{F} + \\eta\\alpha_{M}}\n$$\nThis is the required algebraic expression.\n\nThird, we compute the numerical value of $\\Delta T_{F}^{\\star}$ using the provided parameters:\n- $\\beta = 6.5 \\times 10^{-3}$\n- $\\rho_{0} = 8.0 \\times 10^{-3}$\n- $\\alpha_{F} = -3.6 \\times 10^{-5}~\\text{K}^{-1}$\n- $\\alpha_{M} = -1.6 \\times 10^{-5}~\\text{K}^{-1}$\n- $\\eta = 0.25$\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerator of the expression:\n$$\n\\beta - \\rho_{0} = (6.5 \\times 10^{-3}) - (8.0 \\times 10^{-3}) = -1.5 \\times 10^{-3}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the denominator, which is the effective temperature coefficient of reactivity:\n$$\n\\alpha_{F} + \\eta\\alpha_{M} = (-3.6 \\times 10^{-5}) + (0.25) \\times (-1.6 \\times 10^{-5})\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha_{F} + \\eta\\alpha_{M} = -3.6 \\times 10^{-5} - 0.4 \\times 10^{-5} = -4.0 \\times 10^{-5}~\\text{K}^{-1}\n$$\nNow, we can compute $\\Delta T_{F}^{\\star}$:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{F}^{\\star} = \\frac{-1.5 \\times 10^{-3}}{-4.0 \\times 10^{-5}~\\text{K}^{-1}} = \\frac{1.5}{4.0} \\times 10^{2}~\\text{K}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta T_{F}^{\\star} = 0.375 \\times 100~\\text{K} = 37.5~\\text{K}\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures. Therefore, the fuel temperature rise is $37.50~\\text{K}$.",
