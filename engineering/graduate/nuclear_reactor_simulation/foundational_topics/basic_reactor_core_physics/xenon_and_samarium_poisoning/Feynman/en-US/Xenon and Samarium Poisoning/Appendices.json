            "problem": "Consider a homogeneous, steady-state thermal reactor operating in its fundamental mode with xenon-135 (Xe-135) present at a uniform number density $N_X$ (units $\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$).

Let the effective multiplication factor be $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, and let the fission production term be characterized by the group-averaged quantity $\\nu \\Sigma_f$ (units $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$), where $\\nu$ is the average number of neutrons emitted per fission and $\\Sigma_f$ is the macroscopic fission cross section.

Your explanation should be consistent with the formal derivation rather than relying on heuristic statements.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the differential reactivity worth of Xenon-135, $d\\rho/dN_X$, using first-order perturbation theory, followed by a numerical calculation and an explanation of the physical dependencies embedded in the derived expression.\n\nFirst, we establish the theoretical framework. The steady-state, one-group neutron balance equation for a critical reactor is given in operator form as:\n$$M_0\\phi_0 = \\frac{1}{k_0} F_0\\phi_0$$\nwhere $\\phi_0$ is the fundamental mode neutron flux, $k_0$ is the effective multiplication factor of the reference (unperturbed) system, $M_0$ is the neutron destruction (absorption and leakage) operator, and $F_0$ is the neutron production (fission) operator. For the one-group diffusion model, these operators are defined by their action on the flux $\\phi(\\vec{r})$:\n$$M_0\\phi = -D\\nabla^2\\phi + \\Sigma_{a,0}\\phi$$\n$$F_0\\phi = \\nu\\Sigma_f\\phi$$\nHere, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, $\\Sigma_{a,0}$ is the macroscopic absorption cross section of the reactor material without xenon, and $\\nu\\Sigma_f$ is the macroscopic fission neutron production term.\n\nThe introduction of Xenon-135 at a number density $N_X$ introduces a perturbation to the absorption cross section, and thus to the destruction operator $M$. The perturbed operator is $M = M_0 + \\delta M$, where the perturbation operator $\\delta M$ is defined by:\n$$\\delta M \\phi = (\\overline{\\sigma}_a^{\\mathrm{Xe}} N_X) \\phi$$\nwhere $\\overline{\\sigma}_a^{\\mathrm{Xe}}$ is the spectrum-averaged microscopic absorption cross section of Xe-135. This perturbation causes a change in the multiplication factor from $k_0$ to $k$, which results in a reactivity change.\n\nAccording to first-order perturbation theory, the reactivity change $\\delta\\rho$ due to a perturbation $\\delta M$ in the destruction operator is given by:\n$$\\delta\\rho \\approx -\\frac{\\langle \\phi_0^*, \\delta M \\phi_0 \\rangle}{\\langle \\phi_0^*, F_0 \\phi_0 \\rangle}$$\nwhere $\\phi_0^*$ is the adjoint flux, which is the solution to the adjoint equation $M_0^*\\phi_0^* = \\frac{1}{k_0}F_0^*\\phi_0^*$. The angle brackets $\\langle f, g \\rangle$ denote the inner product, which for one-group theory is an integral over the reactor volume $V$: $\\langle f, g \\rangle = \\int_V f(\\vec{r})g(\\vec{r})dV$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for the perturbation $\\delta M$, the reactivity worth of a xenon concentration $N_X$ is:\n$$\\rho(N_X) \\approx -\\frac{\\langle \\phi_0^*, (\\overline{\\sigma}_a^{\\mathrm{Xe}} N_X) \\phi_0 \\rangle}{\\langle \\phi_0^*, F_0 \\phi_0 \\rangle} = -N_X \\overline{\\sigma}_a^{\\mathrm{Xe}} \\frac{\\langle \\phi_0^*, \\phi_0 \\rangle}{\\langle \\phi_0^*, F_0 \\phi_0 \\rangle}$$\nassuming $\\overline{\\sigma}_a^{\\mathrm{Xe}}$ and $N_X$ are spatially uniform.\n\nThe differential reactivity worth, $d\\rho/dN_X$, is obtained by differentiating this expression with respect to $N_X$:\n$$\\frac{d\\rho}{dN_X} = - \\overline{\\sigma}_a^{\\mathrm{Xe}} \\frac{\\langle \\phi_0^*, \\phi_0 \\rangle}{\\langle \\phi_0^*, F_0 \\phi_0 \\rangle}$$\nWriting the inner products as integrals, we obtain the general expression:\n$$\\frac{d\\rho}{dN_X} = - \\overline{\\sigma}_a^{\\mathrm{Xe}} \\frac{\\int_V \\phi_0^*(\\vec{r})\\phi_0(\\vec{r}) dV}{\\int_V \\phi_0^*(\\vec{r})[\\nu\\Sigma_f(\\vec{r})]\\phi_0(\\vec{r}) dV}$$\nThis expression is the formal answer for the differential worth of a uniformly distributed poison.\n\nThis general expression reveals the dependencies of the xenon worth.\n1.  **Dependence on Flux Shape (Spatial Effects):** The worth is determined by a ratio of two integrals, both weighted by the product $\\phi_0^*(\\vec{r})\\phi_0(\\vec{r})$. The adjoint flux $\\phi_0^*(\\vec{r})$ represents the importance of a neutron at position $\\vec{r}$ to sustaining the chain reaction. The product $\\phi_0^*(\\vec{r})\\phi_0(\\vec{r})$ can be interpreted as the importance-weighted reaction rate density for a process with a unit cross section. The numerator represents the total importance-weighted neutron absorption rate by xenon, while the denominator is the total importance-weighted production rate of fission neutrons. The differential worth therefore measures the effectiveness of an added xenon atom at reducing reactivity, averaged over the entire core and weighted by the importance of the location where the absorption occurs. The worth is largest when xenon is introduced in regions where both the flux and the adjoint flux are high (typically the center of the reactor).\n\n2.  **Dependence on Energy Spectrum:** The problem is formulated in one-group theory, which obscures the explicit energy dependence. However, this dependence is implicitly contained within the group-averaged constants. The microscopic cross section $\\overline{\\sigma}_a^{\\mathrm{Xe}}$ is an average of the energy-dependent cross section $\\sigma_a^{\\mathrm{Xe}}(E)$ over the neutron energy spectrum $\\phi(E)$. Formally, $\\overline{\\sigma}_a^{\\mathrm{Xe}} = \\int \\sigma_a^{\\mathrm{Xe}}(E)\\phi(E)dE / \\int \\phi(E)dE$. Xenon-135 possesses an enormous absorption resonance at thermal energy ($E \\approx 0.075 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$). Consequently, the value of $\\overline{\\sigma}_a^{\\mathrm{Xe}}$ is extremely sensitive to the thermal part of the neutron spectrum. A \"softer\" spectrum (more neutrons at thermal energies) leads to a larger $\\overline{\\sigma}_a^{\\mathrm{Xe}}$ and a more negative (larger magnitude) xenon worth. Conversely, a \"harder\" spectrum reduces the effective cross section and the magnitude of the worth. Similarly, the term $\\nu\\Sigma_f$ is also a spectrum-averaged quantity.\n\nNow, we proceed to the numerical calculation. The problem specifies simplifying assumptions:\n- The forward flux $\\phi(\\vec{r})$ is spatially uniform, so $\\phi(\\vec{r}) = \\phi_c$, a constant.\n- The adjoint flux $\\phi^*(\\vec{r})$ is proportional to the forward flux, so $\\phi^*(\\vec{r}) = C\\phi_c$ for some constant $C$.\n- The fission term $\\nu\\Sigma_f$ is uniform.\n\nApplying these simplifications to the general expression for $d\\rho/dN_X$:\n$$\\frac{d\\rho}{dN_X} = - \\overline{\\sigma}_a^{\\mathrm{Xe}} \\frac{\\int_V (C\\phi_c)(\\phi_c) dV}{\\int_V (C\\phi_c)(\\nu\\Sigma_f)(\\phi_c) dV} = - \\overline{\\sigma}_a^{\\mathrm{Xe}} \\frac{C\\phi_c^2 \\int_V dV}{\\nu\\Sigma_f C\\phi_c^2 \\int_V dV}$$\nThe constants and integrals cancel, leaving a remarkably simple result:\n$$\\frac{d\\rho}{dN_X} = - \\frac{\\overline{\\sigma}_a^{\\mathrm{Xe}}}{\\nu\\Sigma_f}$$\nNote that in this simplified model, the differential worth does not depend on the flux amplitude, the reactor volume, or the value of $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. The given value $k_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 1.05$ is part of the description of the initial state but does not enter the final calculation for the differential worth under these assumptions.\n\nWe substitute the given numerical values:\n- $\\overline{\\sigma}_a^{\\mathrm{Xe}} = 2.65 \\times 10^{-18} \\ \\mathrm{cm}^2$\n- $\\nu \\Sigma_f = 5.0 \\times 10^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\n\n$$\\frac{d\\rho}{dN_X} = - \\frac{2.65 \\times 10^{-18} \\ \\mathrm{cm}^2}{5.0 \\times 10^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}} = -0.53 \\times 10^{-16} \\ \\mathrm{cm}^3$$\nExpressing this in standard scientific notation and rounding to three significant figures:\n$$\\frac{d\\rho}{dN_X} = -5.30 \\times 10^{-17} \\ \\mathrm{cm}^3$$\nThe negative sign correctly indicates that xenon is a neutron poison, and increasing its concentration reduces the reactor's reactivity.",

The objective is to quantify the fractional error introduced when Xenon-135 and Samarium-149 are treated as energy-independent absorbers using a single flux-weighted one-group cross section derived at a pre-shift spectrum, but then applied to a post-shift spectrum.\n\nStart from the fundamental definition that the reaction rate for isotope $i$ is the integral of the product of neutron flux and microscopic absorption cross section over energy. In a two-energy-group representation, the macroscopic absorption for isotope $i$ is determined by the number density $N_i$ and the group-averaged microscopic cross sections. The one-group constant for isotope $i$ is defined by a flux-weighted average over energy of the microscopic cross section using the pre-shift spectrum. For the post-shift spectrum, the true absorption reflects the updated group flux fractions.\n\nAssume the following scientifically plausible data:\n- The isotopes are Xenon-135 and Samarium-149 with number densities $N_{\\mathrm{Xe}} = 3.0 \\times 10^{15}$ atoms per cubic centimeter and $N_{\\mathrm{Sm}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{18}$ atoms per cubic centimeter.\n- Two energy groups are used: “thermal” and “epithermal.” The pre-shift thermal flux fraction is $0.95$ and the epithermal flux fraction is $0.05$. The post-shift thermal flux fraction is $0.70$ and the epithermal flux fraction is $0.30$.

            "solution": "The problem requires an assessment of the fractional error in poison absorption rate when using a one-group cross section model based on a pre-shift neutron spectrum to predict absorption in a post-shift spectrum. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and provides all necessary data for a unique solution.\n\nLet us begin by formalizing the definitions provided. The absorption rate, $A_i$, for a given isotope $i$ with number density $N_i$ subject to a neutron flux spectrum $\\phi(E)$ is given by the integral of the reaction rate density over volume. For a spatially uniform medium, this is proportional to the product of the number density and the spectrum-averaged microscopic absorption cross section, $\\sigma_{a,i}(E)$:\n$$ A_i \\propto N_i \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\sigma_{a,i}(E) \\phi(E) dE $$\nIn a two-group energy representation, this integral is approximated by a sum over the two groups: thermal (group $g=1$) and epithermal (group $g=2$). The total absorption rate for isotope $i$ is:\n$$ A_i = N_i ( \\sigma_{a,i,1} \\phi_1 + \\sigma_{a,i,2} \\phi_2 ) $$\nwhere $\\sigma_{a,i,g}$ is the group-averaged microscopic absorption cross section for isotope $i$ in group $g$, and $\\phi_g$ is the scalar flux in group $g$.\n\nThe total scalar flux is $\\Phi_{total} = \\phi_1 + \\phi_2$. We can define the flux fractions for each group as $f_g = \\phi_g / \\Phi_{total}$. Using this, the absorption rate can be expressed in terms of the total flux and an effective one-group cross section, $\\bar{\\sigma}_{a,i}$:\n$$ A_i = N_i \\Phi_{total} (f_1 \\sigma_{a,i,1} + f_2 \\sigma_{a,i,2}) = N_i \\Phi_{total} \\bar{\\sigma}_{a,i} $$\nwhere the one-group flux-weighted cross section is $\\bar{\\sigma}_{a,i} = f_1 \\sigma_{a,i,1} + f_2 \\sigma_{a,i,2}$.\n\nThe problem describes two scenarios: a \"predicted\" absorption rate based on outdated spectral information, and a \"true\" absorption rate based on the actual post-shift spectrum.\n\nFirst, we define the one-group cross sections using the pre-shift flux fractions.

The total predicted absorption is the sum of the contributions from Xenon-135 and Samarium-149:\n$$ A_{pred} = (N_{\\mathrm{Xe}} \\bar{\\sigma}_{a,\\mathrm{Xe},pre} + N_{\\mathrm{Sm}} \\bar{\\sigma}_{a,\\mathrm{Sm},pre}) \\Phi_{total} $$\n\nNext, we define the \"true\" total poison absorption rate, $A_{true}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires a stability analysis of a point-kinetics reactor model with xenon-135 and iodine-135 dynamics. The stability is assessed by linearizing the system of governing ordinary differential equations (ODEs) around a steady-state operating point and computing the spectral abscissa of the resulting Jacobian matrix. The spectral abscissa is the maximum real part of the eigenvalues of this matrix. A negative spectral abscissa indicates that the steady state is stable, meaning small perturbations will decay over time.\n\nThe system is described by the state vector $\\mathbf{y}(t) = [P(t), C(t), I(t), X(t)]^\\top$, where $P(t)$ is the normalized power, $C(t)$ is the precursor concentration, $I(t)$ is the iodine-135 concentration, and $X(t)$ is the xenon-135 concentration. The governing ODEs are:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{y}) = \\frac{d\\mathbf{y}}{dt} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\rho(X) - \\beta}{\\Lambda} P + \\lambda C \\\\\n\\frac{\\beta}{\\Lambda} P - \\lambda C \\\\\ny_I P - (\\lambda_I + k_{bI} P) I \\\\\ny_X P + \\lambda_I I - (\\lambda_X + k_{bX} P) X\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nwith the reactivity feedback given by $\\rho(X) = \\rho_0 - \\alpha_X X$.\n\nThe first step is to determine the steady-state equilibrium point $\\mathbf{y}^\\star = [P^\\star, C^\\star, I^\\star, X^\\star]^\\top$ for a given power level $P^\\star$. At steady state, all time derivatives are zero, i.e., $\\frac{d\\mathbf{y}}{dt} = \\mathbf{0}$.\n\nFrom the precursor balance equation, $\\frac{dC}{dt} = 0$:\n$$ \\frac{\\beta}{\\Lambda} P^\\star - \\lambda C^\\star = 0 \\implies C^\\star = \\frac{\\beta}{\\lambda \\Lambda} P^\\star $$\n\nFrom the iodine-135 balance equation, $\\frac{dI}{dt} = 0$:\n$$ y_I P^\\star - (\\lambda_I + k_{bI} P^\\star) I^\\star = 0 \\implies I^\\star = \\frac{y_I P^\\star}{\\lambda_I + k_{bI} P^\\star} $$\n\nFrom the xenon-135 balance equation, $\\frac{dX}{dt} = 0$:\n$$ y_X P^\\star + \\lambda_I I^\\star - (\\lambda_X + k_{bX} P^\\star) X^\\star = 0 \\implies X^\\star = \\frac{y_X P^\\star + \\lambda_I I^\\star}{\\lambda_X + k_{bX} P^\\star} $$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $I^\\star$ into the equation for $X^\\star$ gives a direct relationship between $X^\\star$ and $P^\\star$.\n\nFinally, from the power balance equation, $\\frac{dP}{dt} = 0$:\n$$ \\frac{\\rho(X^\\star) - \\beta}{\\Lambda} P^\\star + \\lambda C^\\star = 0 $$\nSubstituting the expression for $C^\\star$:\n$$ \\frac{\\rho(X^\\star) - \\beta}{\\Lambda} P^\\star + \\lambda \\left(\\frac{\\beta}{\\lambda \\Lambda} P^\\star\\right) = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{P^\\star}{\\Lambda} (\\rho(X^\\star) - \\beta + \\beta) = 0 \\implies \\frac{P^\\star \\rho(X^\\star)}{\\Lambda} = 0 $$\nFor a non-trivial steady state where $P^\\star > 0$, this requires the net reactivity to be zero: $\\rho(X^\\star) = 0$. This condition is used to set the base reactivity $\\rho_0 = \\alpha_X X^\\star$, ensuring the reactor is critical at the specified steady state.\n\nThe second step is to linearize the system around this equilibrium point $\\mathbf{y}^\\star$. This involves computing the Jacobian matrix $J = \\left.\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{F}}{\\partial \\mathbf{y}}\\right|_{\\mathbf{y}^\\star}$. The elements of the Jacobian, $J_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial F_i}{\\partial y_j}$, are the partial derivatives of the components of $\\mathbf{F}$ with respect to the state variables, evaluated at the steady state.\n\nLet the state variables be indexed as $y_1=P, y_2=C, y_3=I, y_4=X$. The partial derivatives are:\n- $\\frac{\\partial F_P}{\\partial P} = \\frac{\\rho(X) - \\beta}{\\Lambda}$. At steady state, $\\rho(X^\\star)=0$, so $J_{11} = -\\frac{\\beta}{\\Lambda}$.\n- $\\frac{\\partial F_P}{\\partial C} = \\lambda$, so $J_{12} = \\lambda$.\n- $\\frac{\\partial F_P}{\\partial I} = 0$, so $J_{13} = 0$.\n- $\\frac{\\partial F_P}{\\partial X} = -\\frac{\\alpha_X P}{\\Lambda}$. At steady state, $J_{14} = -\\frac{\\alpha_X P^\\star}{\\Lambda}$.\n\n- $\\frac{\\partial F_C}{\\partial P} = \\frac{\\beta}{\\Lambda}$, so $J_{21} = \\frac{\\beta}{\\Lambda}$.\n- $\\frac{\\partial F_C}{\\partial C} = -\\lambda$, so $J_{22} = -\\lambda$.\n- $\\frac{\\partial F_C}{\\partial I} = 0$, so $J_{23} = 0$.\n- $\\frac{\\partial F_C}{\\partial X} = 0$, so $J_{24} = 0$.\n\n- $\\frac{\\partial F_I}{\\partial P} = y_I - k_{bI} I$. At steady state, $J_{31} = y_I - k_{bI} I^\\star$.\n- $\\frac{\\partial F_I}{\\partial C} = 0$, so $J_{32} = 0$.\n- $\\frac{\\partial F_I}{\\partial I} = -(\\lambda_I + k_{bI} P)$. At steady state, $J_{33} = -(\\lambda_I + k_{bI} P^\\star)$.\n- $\\frac{\\partial F_I}{\\partial X} = 0$, so $J_{34} = 0$.\n\n- $\\frac{\\partial F_X}{\\partial P} = y_X - k_{bX} X$. At steady state, $J_{41} = y_X - k_{bX} X^\\star$.\n- $\\frac{\\partial F_X}{\\partial C} = 0$, so $J_{42} = 0$.\n- $\\frac{\\partial F_X}{\\partial I} = \\lambda_I$, so $J_{43} = \\lambda_I$.\n- $\\frac{\\partial F_X}{\\partial X} = -(\\lambda_X + k_{bX} P)$. At steady state, $J_{44} = -(\\lambda_X + k_{bX} P^\\star)$.\n\nThe resulting Jacobian matrix at the steady state $\\mathbf{y}^\\star$ is:\n$$\nJ = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-\\frac{\\beta}{\\Lambda} & \\lambda & 0 & -\\frac{\\alpha_X P^\\star}{\\Lambda} \\\\\n\\frac{\\beta}{\\Lambda} & -\\lambda & 0 & 0 \\\\\ny_I - k_{bI} I^\\star & 0 & -(\\lambda_I + k_{bI} P^\\star) & 0 \\\\\ny_X - k_{bX} X^\\star & 0 & \\lambda_I & -(\\lambda_X + k_{bX} P^\\star)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe final step is to numerically compute the eigenvalues of this matrix for each test case. The spectral abscissa is the maximum value among the real parts of these eigenvalues. This value dictates the asymptotic stability of the system.\n\nThe computational procedure is as follows for each test case:\n1.  Use the given parameters ($P^\\star, \\beta, \\Lambda, \\dots, \\alpha_X$) to calculate the steady-state concentrations $I^\\star$ and $X^\\star$.\n2.  Construct the $4 \\times 4$ Jacobian matrix $J$ using the derived analytical expressions and the calculated steady-state values.\n3.  Use a numerical library to find the eigenvalues of the matrix $J$.\n4.  Determine the maximum real part among all eigenvalues. This is the spectral abscissa.\n5.  Round the result to six decimal places and format it as requested.",
