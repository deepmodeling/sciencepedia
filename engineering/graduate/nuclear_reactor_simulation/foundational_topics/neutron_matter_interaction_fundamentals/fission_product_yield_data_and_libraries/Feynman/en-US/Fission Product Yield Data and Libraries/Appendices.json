            "problem": "You are given Fission Product Yield (FPY) records for neutron-induced fission reactions and must construct an internal representation as a three-dimensional tensor $Y(Z,A;E)$, where $Z$ is the proton number, $A$ is the mass number, and $E$ is the incident neutron energy expressed in electronvolts (eV). The tensor $Y(Z,A;E)$ encodes independent yields and is defined such that the sum over all $(Z,A)$ at fixed $E$ equals the expected number of prompt fission fragments per fission event. The internal representation must be consistent with foundational conservation principles and well-tested empirical modeling conventions used in nuclear reactor simulation.\n\nFundamental base:\n- Conservation of charge: For a fission of a compound nucleus with proton number $Z_0$, the total proton number in the two prompt fission fragments equals $Z_0$.\n- Conservation of mass number with prompt neutron emission: For a fission of a compound nucleus with mass number $A_0$ at incident energy $E$, the total mass number in the two prompt fission fragments equals $A_0 - \\nu(E)$, where $\\nu(E)$ is the average prompt neutron multiplicity at energy $E$.\n- Independent yield normalization: The total expected number of fragments per fission event is two, so $\\sum_{Z,A} Y(Z,A;E) = 2$.\n- Unchanged Charge Distribution (UCD) model: The most probable fragment charge for a given fragment mass $A$ is given by $Z_{\\mathrm{UCD}}(A) = Z_0 \\frac{A}{A_0}$. To enforce exact charge conservation when using mass-chain yields, a uniform shift $\\delta(E)$ can be applied to the means so that $\\sum_{A} y_A(E)\\left(Z_0 \\frac{A}{A_0} + \\delta(E)\\right) = Z_0$, where $y_A(E)$ are the independent yields per mass chain at energy $E$.\n\nLibrary FPY record formats:\n- Format I (independent nuclide yields): For each energy $E$, the library provides a list of tuples $(Z,A,y)$ representing the independent yield $y$ for fragment $(Z,A)$.\n- Format II (mass-chain yields with charge distribution): For each energy $E$, the library provides mass-chain yields $y_A(E)$ for each mass number $A$. The yields over charge for each $A$ are distributed using a normal distribution in $Z$ with mean $Z_p(A;E) = Z_0 \\frac{A}{A_0} + \\delta(E)$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_Z(A;E)$, subsequently discretized onto integer $Z \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,Z_0\\}$ and renormalized such that $\\sum_Z P(Z\\mid A,E) = 1$. The internal yields then satisfy $Y(Z,A;E) = y_A(E)\\,P(Z\\mid A,E)$.\n\nIntegrity checks required before using $Y(Z,A;E)$ in depletion codes:\n- Non-negativity and finiteness: $Y(Z,A;E) \\ge 0$ and finite for all $Z$, $A$.\n- Normalization: $\\left|\\sum_{Z,A} Y(Z,A;E) - 2\\right| \\le \\tau_{\\mathrm{norm}}$.\n- Charge conservation: $\\left|\\sum_{Z,A} Z\\,Y(Z,A;E) - Z_0\\right| \\le \\tau_Z$.\n- Mass conservation: $\\left|\\sum_{Z,A} A\\,Y(Z,A;E) - \\left(A_0 - \\nu(E)\\right)\\right| \\le \\tau_A$.\n- Support constraints: $Y(Z,A;E) = 0$ for $Z < 0$, $Z > Z_0$, $A < 1$, or $A > A_0$.\n\nYou must implement the mapping from library records to the internal tensor $Y(Z,A;E)$, apply the above integrity checks for each specified energy $E$, and return a boolean for each test case indicating whether all checks pass at all provided energies.\n\nUse the following tolerances:\n- $\\tau_{\\mathrm{norm}} = 10^{-8}$,\n- $\\tau_Z = 10^{-8}$,\n- $\\tau_A = 10^{-8}$.\n\nEnergy must be interpreted and used in electronvolts (eV). No angles are involved. All final numerical output must be unitless booleans.\n\nTest suite:\n- Case $1$ (happy path, Format I): Parent is $Z_0 = 92$, $A_0 = 236$; energies $[0.0253]$ eV; average prompt neutron multiplicities $\\nu(E) = [2.0]$; independent nuclide yields at $E = 0.0253$ eV are $(Z,A,y) = (39,95,1.0)$ and $(53,139,1.0)$. This should satisfy all checks.\n- Case $2$ (mass conservation violation, Format II): Parent is $Z_0 = 92$, $A_0 = 236$; energies $[5.0\\times 10^{5}]$ eV; $\\nu(E) = [2.5]$; mass-chain yields at $E = 5.0 \\times 10^{5}$ eV are $(A,y_A) = (95,1.2)$ and $(139,0.8)$; use $\\sigma_Z = 0.3$ for all $A$. This should violate the mass conservation check since $\\sum_{A} A\\,y_A = 95\\times 1.2 + 139\\times 0.8 = 225.2 \\ne 236 - 2.5 = 233.5$.\n- Case $3$ (non-negativity violation, Format I): Parent is $Z_0 = 92$, $A_0 = 236$; energies $[0.1]$ eV; $\\nu(E) = [2.0]$; independent nuclide yields at $E = 0.1$ eV are $(39,95,1.2)$, $(53,139,0.9)$, and $(40,95,-0.1)$, introducing a negative yield.\n- Case $4$ (normalization violation, Format II): Parent is $Z_0 = 92$, $A_0 = 236$; energies $[0.1]$ eV; $\\nu(E) = [2.3]$; mass-chain yields at $E = 0.1$ eV are $(A,y_A) = (90,0.8)$ and $(146,1.1)$; use $\\sigma_Z = 0.4$ for all $A$. This should violate the normalization check since $\\sum_A y_A = 1.9 \\ne 2$.\n\nRequired output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (e.g., \"[result1,result2,result3,result4]\"). Each result must be a boolean corresponding to the pass/fail status of the integrity checks for the respective test case.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the implementation of a validation procedure for Fission Product Yield (FPY) data used in nuclear reactor simulations. This procedure involves constructing an internal representation of the yield data and verifying its consistency against fundamental physical principles and empirical modeling conventions. The final output for each test case is a boolean value indicating whether the provided data pass all integrity checks for all specified energies.\n\nThe core of the problem is the FPY tensor, denoted $Y(Z,A;E)$, which represents the independent yield of a fission fragment with proton number $Z$ and mass number $A$ from a fission event induced by a neutron of energy $E$. The parent fissioning nucleus is characterized by its proton number $Z_0$ and mass number $A_0$.\n\nThe first step is to construct a numerical representation of $Y(Z,A;E)$ from the provided library records. Since FPY data is sparse (most $(Z,A)$ pairs have zero yield), a sparse representation, such as a list of tuples $(Z,A,y)$ where $y = Y(Z,A;E)$, is computationally efficient. The construction process depends on the format of the library data.\n\nFor Format I data, which provides independent nuclide yields directly as a list of $(Z,A,y)$ tuples for each energy $E$, the construction is a direct mapping. The provided list of tuples for a given $E$ becomes our sparse representation of $Y(Z,A;E)$.\n\nFor Format II data, the process is more involved. The library provides mass-chain yields, $y_A(E)$, for each mass number $A$, and a model for the charge distribution along each mass chain. This model is based on the Unchanged Charge Distribution (UCD) hypothesis. The probability of forming a fragment with charge $Z$ given its mass is $A$ is modeled by a normal distribution. The mean of this distribution, $Z_p(A;E)$, is given by $Z_p(A;E) = Z_0 \\frac{A}{A_0} + \\delta(E)$. The term $\\delta(E)$ is a uniform charge shift applied to all mass chains at energy $E$ to enforce overall charge conservation on average. It is calculated by solving the equation $\\sum_{A} y_A(E)\\left(Z_0 \\frac{A}{A_0} + \\delta(E)\\right) = Z_0$ for $\\delta(E)$, which yields:\n$$\n\\delta(E) = \\frac{Z_0 - \\frac{Z_0}{A_0} \\sum_{A} A \\cdot y_A(E)}{\\sum_{A} y_A(E)}\n$$\nThis calculation is only meaningful if $\\sum_A y_A(E) \\neq 0$. The standard deviation of the charge distribution is given as $\\sigma_Z(A;E)$.\n\nTo obtain the independent yields, the continuous normal probability density function must be discretized to a probability mass function $P(Z|A,E)$ over the valid integer charge range $Z \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, Z_0\\}$. A rigorous method for this discretization is to integrate the probability density function over unit intervals centered on each integer $Z$. The unnormalized probability for a given $Z$ is calculated from the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution, $\\Phi(z; \\mu, \\sigma)$:\n$$\nP_{\\text{unnorm}}(Z | A,E) = \\Phi(Z+0.5; Z_p(A;E), \\sigma_Z) - \\Phi(Z-0.5; Z_p(A;E), \\sigma_Z)\n$$\nThese probabilities are then renormalized over the valid range of $Z$ to ensure that $\\sum_{Z=0}^{Z_0} P(Z|A,E) = 1$. The final independent yield is then computed as $Y(Z,A;E) = y_A(E) \\cdot P(Z|A,E)$.\n\nOnce the yield tensor $Y(Z,A;E)$ is constructed for a specific energy $E$, it must undergo a series of integrity checks with specified tolerances. A test case is considered valid only if all checks pass for all specified energies.\n\n1.  **Non-negativity and Support Constraints**: All yields must be non-negative, $Y(Z,A;E) \\ge 0$. Furthermore, the fragments must be physically possible, which imposes constraints on their proton and mass numbers. The yields must be zero, $Y(Z,A;E)=0$, if $Z < 0$, $Z > Z_0$, $A < 1$, or $A > A_0$.\n\n2.  **Normalization**: The fission process produces two fragments. Therefore, the sum of all independent yields must equal $2$. The check is:\n    $$\n    \\left| \\sum_{Z,A} Y(Z,A;E) - 2 \\right| \\le \\tau_{\\mathrm{norm}}\n    $$\n    where the tolerance $\\tau_{\\mathrm{norm}} = 10^{-8}$. For Format II data, this check is equivalent to verifying if $\\sum_A y_A(E)$ is close to $2$, since $\\sum_{Z,A} Y(Z,A;E) = \\sum_A y_A(E) \\sum_Z P(Z|A,E) = \\sum_A y_A(E)$.\n\n3.  **Charge Conservation**: The total number of protons must be conserved. The sum of the charges of all fragments, weighted by their yields, must equal the charge of the parent nucleus, $Z_0$. The check is:\n    $$\n    \\left| \\sum_{Z,A} Z \\cdot Y(Z,A;E) - Z_0 \\right| \\le \\tau_{Z}\n    $$\n    with tolerance $\\tau_Z = 10^{-8}$.\n\n4.  **Mass Conservation**: The total number of nucleons (protons and neutrons) must be conserved. The sum of the mass numbers of the fragments, weighted by their yields, must equal the mass number of the parent nucleus, $A_0$, minus the average number of prompt neutrons emitted, $\\nu(E)$. The check is:\n    $$\n    \\left| \\sum_{Z,A} A \\cdot Y(Z,A;E) - (A_0 - \\nu(E)) \\right| \\le \\tau_A\n    $$\n    with tolerance $\\tau_A = 10^{-8}$. For Format II data, this check is equivalent to verifying if $\\sum_A A \\cdot y_A(E)$ is close to $A_0 - \\nu(E)$.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds by iterating through each test case. For each case, it iterates through the provided list of energies. At each energy, it constructs the sparse FPY data and performs the five checks. If any check fails at any energy, the validation for that test case terminates, and the result is `False`. If all checks pass for all energies, the result is `True`. The boolean results from all test cases are collected and formatted into the required output string.",

            "problem": "In reactor depletion and fission product inventory calculations, independent fission yields and cumulative yields are connected by a linear decay-feed network. Consider a single fission fragment nuclide with two isomeric states, a metastable state $J^{m}$ and a ground state $J^{g}$. The total independent yield of the nuclide is $y_{0}$, which is split into the two isomeric states with an isomeric fraction $r$ to the metastable state, so that $Y^{i}(J^{m}) = r\\,y_{0}$ and $Y^{i}(J^{g}) = (1 - r)\\,y_{0}$. The independent yields to all other nuclides in this chain (defined below) are zero.\n\nThe metastable state $J^{m}$ decays by three mutually exclusive channels: internal transition to the ground state $J^{g}$ with probability $a$, direct beta decay to a stable nuclide $L$ with probability $b_{mL}$, and beta decay to a distinct stable nuclide $K$ with probability $b_{mK}$. The ground state $J^{g}$ beta decays to $L$ with probability $b_{gL}$ and to another stable nuclide $M$ with probability $b_{gM}$. All branching probabilities satisfy normalization for each parent: $a + b_{mL} + b_{mK} = 1$ and $b_{gL} + b_{gM} = 1$. Assume $L$, $K$, and $M$ are stable and receive no independent yields.\n\nTreat the decay network as a linear system in the standard form where the cumulative yield $Y^{c}(i)$ for any nuclide $i$ equals its independent yield $Y^{i}(i)$ plus the sum over all direct parents $j$ of the product of the parent’s cumulative yield and the branching probability from $j$ to $i$.

It is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. The task is a direct application of fundamental principles in nuclear data analysis. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe cumulative yield for any nuclide $i$, denoted $Y^{c}(i)$, is its independent yield $Y^{i}(i)$ plus the yield it receives from the decay of all its direct parents. The governing equation is given as:\n$$Y^{c}(i) = Y^{i}(i) + \\sum_{j} T_{ij} Y^{c}(j)$$\nwhere $T_{ij}$ is the branching probability from parent $j$ to daughter $i$. We apply this relation to the nuclides in the specified decay chain: $J^{m}$, $J^{g}$, and $L$.\n\n1.  **Cumulative Yield of $J^{m}$**: The nuclide $J^{m}$ has no parents in this context, as it is produced directly from fission. Therefore, the summation term is zero.\n    $$Y^{c}(J^{m}) = Y^{i}(J^{m}) + 0 = r\\,y_{0}$$\n\n2.  **Cumulative Yield of $J^{g}$**: The nuclide $J^{g}$ has two sources: its own independent yield and the decay feed from its parent, $J^{m}$, via internal transition. The branching probability for the decay $J^{m} \\to J^{g}$ is $a$.\n    $$Y^{c}(J^{g}) = Y^{i}(J^{g}) + T_{J^{g}, J^{m}} Y^{c}(J^{m})$$\n    Substituting the given expressions:\n    $$Y^{c}(J^{g}) = (1 - r)\\,y_{0} + a Y^{c}(J^{m})$$\n    Now, substituting the result for $Y^{c}(J^{m})$ from step 1:\n    $$Y^{c}(J^{g}) = (1 - r)\\,y_{0} + a (r\\,y_{0})$$\n    Factoring out $y_{0}$:\n    $$Y^{c}(J^{g}) = (1 - r + ar) y_{0}$$\n\n3.  **Cumulative Yield of $L$**: The nuclide $L$ is stable and has zero independent yield ($Y^{i}(L)=0$). It is fed by the beta decay of two parents: $J^{m}$ and $J^{g}$. The branching probability for $J^{m} \\to L$ is $b_{mL}$, and for $J^{g} \\to L$ is $b_{gL}$.\n    $$Y^{c}(L) = Y^{i}(L) + T_{L, J^{m}} Y^{c}(J^{m}) + T_{L, J^{g}} Y^{c}(J^{g})$$\n    Substituting the known values and expressions:\n    $$Y^{c}(L) = 0 + b_{mL} Y^{c}(J^{m}) + b_{gL} Y^{c}(J^{g})$$\n    Now, substituting the expressions for $Y^{c}(J^{m})$ and $Y^{c}(J^{g})$:\n    $$Y^{c}(L) = b_{mL} (r\\,y_{0}) + b_{gL} ((1 - r + ar) y_{0})$$\n    To find the final expression for $Y^{c}(L)$, we factor out the total initial yield $y_{0}$:\n    $$Y^{c}(L) = [b_{mL}r + b_{gL}(1 - r + ar)] y_{0}$$\n    This is the derived expression for the cumulative yield of $L$.\n\n### Interpretation and Calculation\n\nThe problem asks to interpret the coefficient of $y_{0}$ as an effective branching fraction, $t_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, from an aggregated nuclide $J$ to $L$. The total independent yield of this aggregated nuclide is $Y^{i}(J) = Y^{i}(J^{m}) + Y^{i}(J^{g}) = r\\,y_{0} + (1-r)y_{0} = y_{0}$. In this simplified picture, the cumulative yield of $L$ would be $Y^{c}(L) = t_{\\mathrm{eff}} Y^{c}(J)$. Since $J$ has no parents, $Y^{c}(J) = Y^{i}(J) = y_{0}$. Thus, $Y^{c}(L) = t_{\\mathrm{eff}} y_{0}$.\n\nBy comparing this with our derived expression, we can identify $t_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{eff}} = b_{mL}r + b_{gL}(1 - r + ar)$$\nThis expression represents the total fraction of fissions producing nuclide $J$ (in either isomeric state) that eventually results in the formation of the stable nuclide $L$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $t_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ using the provided data:\n- $r = 0.37$\n- $a = 0.70$\n- $b_{mL} = 0.10$\n- $b_{gL} = 0.95$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $t_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{eff}} = (0.10)(0.37) + (0.95) \\left[ 1 - 0.37 + (0.70)(0.37) \\right]$$\nFirst, calculate the term inside the brackets:\n$$1 - 0.37 + (0.70)(0.37) = 0.63 + 0.259 = 0.889$$\nNow, substitute this back into the expression for $t_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{eff}} = (0.10)(0.37) + (0.95)(0.889)$$\n$$t_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 0.037 + 0.84455$$\n$$t_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 0.88155$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$t_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx 0.8816$$\nThis is the final numerical value for the effective branching fraction.",
