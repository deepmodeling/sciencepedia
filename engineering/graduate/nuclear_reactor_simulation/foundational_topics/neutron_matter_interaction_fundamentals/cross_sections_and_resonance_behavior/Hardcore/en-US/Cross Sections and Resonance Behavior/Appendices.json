            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically examined and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of nuclear reactor physics, specifically the treatment of neutron cross sections in the unresolved resonance region. The problem is mathematically well-posed, with all necessary parameters and definitions provided to ensure a unique, computable solution. The language is objective and the setup is free from internal contradictions or physical implausibility.\n\nThe task is to analyze the convergence of a subgroup approximation for a self-shielding functional in the unresolved resonance region (URR). This involves comparing the numerically computed exact expectation of the functional with its discrete approximation for an increasing number of subgroups.\n\nThe self-shielding functional, which describes the effective absorption rate in a homogeneous medium under the narrow-resonance approximation, is given by the rational function\n$$\ng(\\sigma;\\alpha) \\equiv \\frac{\\sigma}{1+\\alpha\\,\\sigma}\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma$ is the microscopic absorption cross section, a positive random variable, and $\\alpha = 1/\\sigma_0$ is the inverse of the constant background cross section $\\sigma_0$.\n\nThe microscopic cross section $\\sigma$ at a fixed energy in the URR is modeled by a Gamma probability density function (PDF):\n$$\np(\\sigma; k, \\theta) \\equiv \\frac{1}{\\theta^k \\,\\Gamma(k)}\\,\\sigma^{k-1}\\,e^{-\\sigma/\\theta}, \\quad \\sigma \\ge 0\n$$\nwith shape parameter $k>0$ and scale parameter $\\theta>0$. The corresponding cumulative distribution function (CDF) is $F(\\sigma; k, \\theta)$.\n\nThe analysis proceeds in three main steps: calculation of the exact expectation, construction of the discrete subgroup approximation, and evaluation of the relative error.\n\nFirst, the exact expectation of the shielding functional, denoted $I(k,\\theta,\\alpha)$, is defined by the integral of the functional over the distribution of the cross section:\n$$\nI(k,\\theta,\\alpha) \\equiv \\int_0^{\\infty} g(\\sigma;\\alpha)\\,p(\\sigma; k, \\theta)\\,d\\sigma = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{1+\\alpha\\,\\sigma}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{\\theta^k \\,\\Gamma(k)}\\,\\sigma^{k-1}\\,e^{-\\sigma/\\theta}\\right) \\,d\\sigma\n$$\nThis integral does not generally possess a simple closed-form analytical solution. Therefore, its value must be determined using numerical quadrature methods. The integrand is a product of two well-behaved functions: $g(\\sigma;\\alpha)$ is bounded and continuous for $\\sigma \\ge 0$, and $p(\\sigma; k, \\theta)$ is the Gamma PDF. The integral is guaranteed to converge. We will employ the `scipy.integrate.quad` function for a high-precision evaluation over the domain $\\sigma \\in [0, \\infty)$.\n\nSecond, we construct the $n$-point subgroup approximation, $S_n(k,\\theta,\\alpha)$. This method discretizes the probability space of the random variable $\\sigma$. The procedure is equivalent to changing the integration variable from $\\sigma$ to the probability level $u=F(\\sigma;k,\\theta)$, such that $d\\sigma = du / p(\\sigma;k,\\theta)$ and $\\sigma = F^{-1}(u;k,\\theta)$. The expectation integral transforms to:\n$$\nI(k,\\theta,\\alpha) = \\int_0^1 g(F^{-1}(u;k,\\theta); \\alpha) \\, du\n$$\nThe subgroup approximation $S_n$ is a midpoint Riemann sum of this transformed integral. The probability interval $[0,1]$ is partitioned into $n$ equal subintervals of width $w_i = 1/n$. The evaluation points, or nodes, are chosen as the mid-quantiles:\n$$\nu_i \\equiv \\frac{i-\\tfrac{1}{2}}{n}, \\quad i=1,2,\\dots,n\n$$\nThe corresponding cross section values, termed the subgroup cross sections, are obtained via the inverse CDF, also known as the quantile function:\n$$\n\\sigma_i \\equiv F^{-1}(u_i;k,\\theta)\n$$\nComputationally, the quantile function for the Gamma distribution is implemented as the percent point function (PPF), available in `scipy.stats.gamma.ppf`. The subgroup approximation is then the weighted sum:\n$$\nS_n(k,\\theta,\\alpha) \\equiv \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \\, g(\\sigma_i;\\alpha) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\sigma_i}{1+\\alpha\\,\\sigma_i}\n$$\nBy construction, as $n \\to \\infty$, the Riemann-sum approximation $S_n$ converges to the exact integral $I$. The function $g(F^{-1}(u;k,\\theta); \\alpha)$ is continuous with respect to $u \\in (0,1)$, which guarantees the convergence of the midpoint rule. Our task is to demonstrate this convergence numerically.\n\nThird, the relative error $\\varepsilon_n$ is computed for each value of $n$ to quantify the accuracy of the approximation:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_n \\equiv \\frac{\\left|S_n(k,\\theta,\\alpha) - I(k,\\theta,\\alpha)\\right|}{I(k,\\theta,\\alpha)}\n$$\nWe will implement an algorithm that, for each given test case $(k, \\theta, \\sigma_0)$, first computes the reference value $I(k,\\theta,\\alpha)$ and then iteratively computes $S_n(k,\\theta,\\alpha)$ and $\\varepsilon_n$ for $n \\in \\{2, 4, 8, 16\\}$. This will produce a sequence of errors that is expected to decrease as $n$ increases, thereby numerically verifying the convergence of the subgroup method.",
