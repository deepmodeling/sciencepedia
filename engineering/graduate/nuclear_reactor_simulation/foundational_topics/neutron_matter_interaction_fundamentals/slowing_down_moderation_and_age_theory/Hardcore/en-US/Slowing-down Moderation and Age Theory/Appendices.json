These are standard and well-established principles. The data for hydrogen and graphite are realistic.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined with all necessary parameters and constants provided. The assumptions, such as constant cross sections and CSDA, render the problem analytically solvable and ensure a unique solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, technical language, free from any subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A detailed solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Fermi Age Formula**\n\nThe Fermi age, $\\tau$, is a parameter with units of area ($L^2$) that characterizes the mean square distance a neutron travels from its point of origin as a point source while slowing down from an initial energy $E_0$ to a final energy $E$. It is formally defined through the age-diffusion equation. The relationship between age $\\tau$ and lethargy $u$ is given by the differential expression:\n$$ d\\tau = \\frac{D(u)}{\\xi \\Sigma_s(u)} du $$\nwhere $D(u)$ is the energy-dependent diffusion coefficient, $\\xi$ is the average logarithmic energy decrement, and $\\Sigma_s(u)$ is the macroscopic scattering cross section. The total age for slowing down from lethargy $0$ (energy $E_0$) to lethargy $u$ (energy $E$) is obtained by integrating this expression:\n$$ \\tau(u) = \\int_0^u \\frac{D(u')}{\\xi \\Sigma_s(u')} du' $$\nThis definition is a cornerstone result derived from the fundamental principles of random-flight diffusion and neutron slowing down.\n\nThe problem provides the specific forms for the quantities in the integrand:\n1. The diffusion coefficient is given as $D = \\frac{1}{3 \\Sigma_{tr}}$.\n2. The problem assumes the medium is scattering-dominated and scattering is nearly isotropic, such that the scattering cross section is approximately equal to the transport cross section: $\\Sigma_s \\approx \\Sigma_{tr}$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the integral for $\\tau(u)$:\n$$ \\tau(u) = \\int_0^u \\frac{1/(3 \\Sigma_{tr}(u'))}{\\xi \\Sigma_s(u')} du' $$\nApplying the approximation $\\Sigma_s(u') \\approx \\Sigma_{tr}(u')$ yields:\n$$ \\tau(u) \\approx \\int_0^u \\frac{1}{3 \\xi \\Sigma_{tr}(u')^2} du' $$\nThis is the general expression for the Fermi age under the stated assumptions. The problem further simplifies the context by stating that the material properties ($\\xi$ and $\\Sigma_{tr}$) can be taken as constants over the slowing-down interval. With $\\xi$ and $\\Sigma_{tr}$ being constant, they can be moved outside the integral:\n$$ \\tau(u) = \\frac{1}{3 \\xi \\Sigma_{tr}^2} \\int_0^u du' $$\nPerforming the simple integration gives the final derived expression for Fermi age for a a total lethargy change of $u$:\n$$ \\tau(u) = \\frac{u}{3 \\xi \\Sigma_{tr}^2} $$\n\n**Calculation of the Ratio of Fermi Ages**\n\nFirst, we must calculate the total lethargy change, $u$, for neutrons slowing down from $E_0 = 2.0$ MeV to $E = 0.10$ eV.\nThe initial energy is $E_0 = 2.0 \\text{ MeV} = 2.0 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\nThe final energy is $E = 0.10 \\text{ eV}$.\nThe lethargy change is:\n$$ u = \\ln\\left(\\frac{E_0}{E}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{2.0 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}}{0.10 \\text{ eV}}\\right) = \\ln(2.0 \\times 10^7) $$\nNumerically, $u \\approx 16.8112$.\n\nUsing the derived formula, the Fermi age for hydrogen ($\\mathrm{H}$) is:\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{H}} = \\frac{u}{3 \\xi_{\\mathrm{H}} \\Sigma_{tr,\\mathrm{H}}^2} $$\nAnd for graphite ($\\mathrm{Gr}$):\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{Gr}} = \\frac{u}{3 \\xi_{\\mathrm{Gr}} \\Sigma_{tr,\\mathrm{Gr}}^2} $$\n\nThe ratio $\\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{Gr}}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{H}}}$ is then:\n$$ \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{Gr}}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{H}}} = \\frac{u / (3 \\xi_{\\mathrm{Gr}} \\Sigma_{tr,\\mathrm{Gr}}^2)}{u / (3 \\xi_{\\mathrm{H}} \\Sigma_{tr,\\mathrm{H}}^2)} $$\nThe terms $u$ and $3$ cancel, yielding an expression that is independent of the specific energy range:\n$$ \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{Gr}}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{H}}} = \\frac{\\xi_{\\mathrm{H}} \\Sigma_{tr,\\mathrm{H}}^2}{\\xi_{\\mathrm{Gr}} \\Sigma_{tr,\\mathrm{Gr}}^2} $$\n\nNow, substitute the given material properties:\n- $\\xi_{\\mathrm{H}} = 1.000$\n- $\\Sigma_{tr,\\mathrm{H}} = 1.00 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$\n- $\\xi_{\\mathrm{Gr}} = 0.158$\n- $\\Sigma_{tr,\\mathrm{Gr}} = 0.35 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$\n\n$$ \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{Gr}}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{H}}} = \\frac{(1.000) \\times (1.00 \\text{ cm}^{-1})^2}{(0.158) \\times (0.35 \\text{ cm}^{-1})^2} = \\frac{1.000}{0.158 \\times 0.1225} = \\frac{1.000}{0.019355} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{Gr}}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{H}}} \\approx 51.666236 $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $51.67$.\n\n**Physical Explanation**\n\nThe Fermi age $\\tau$ is one-sixth of the mean square distance a neutron travels from its source point while slowing down. The significantly larger Fermi age in graphite compared to hydrogen ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{Gr}} \\gg \\tau_{\\mathrm{H}}$) can be explained by examining the two physical factors that determine its value, as seen in the formula $\\tau \\propto \\frac{1}{\\xi \\Sigma_{tr}^2}$:\n\n1.  **Slowing-Down Power per Collision ($\\xi$)**: The average logarithmic energy decrement, $\\xi$, measures how efficiently a moderator removes energy from a neutron in a single collision. For hydrogen, $\\xi_{\\mathrm{H}} = 1.000$, which is the maximum possible value. This is because the proton mass is nearly equal to the neutron mass, allowing for a large energy transfer. For graphite (carbon-12), $\\xi_{\\mathrm{Gr}} = 0.158$, which is much smaller. Consequently, it takes far more scattering collisions in graphite to slow a neutron down over the same energy range compared to hydrogen. The number of collisions is inversely proportional to $\\xi$ ($N \\propto 1/\\xi$).\n\n2.  **Distance Between Collisions ($\\ell_{tr}$)**: The transport mean free path, $\\ell_{tr} = 1/\\Sigma_{tr}$, is the average distance a neutron travels before an effectively randomizing scatter occurs. For hydrogen, $\\ell_{tr,\\mathrm{H}} = 1/(1.00 \\text{ cm}^{-1}) = 1.00$ cm. For graphite, $\\ell_{tr,\\mathrm{Gr}} = 1/(0.35 \\text{ cm}^{-1}) \\approx 2.86$ cm. Neutrons travel, on average, a much greater distance between collisions in graphite than in hydrogen.\n\nThe Fermi age can be thought of as being proportional to the product of the number of steps in a random walk and the square of the step length. In this analogy, the number of steps is the number of collisions ($N \\propto 1/\\xi$) and the step length is the transport mean free path ($\\ell_{tr} = 1/\\Sigma_{tr}$).\nThus, $\\tau \\propto N \\ell_{tr}^2 \\propto \\frac{1}{\\xi} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\Sigma_{tr}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\xi \\Sigma_{tr}^2}$.\n\nGraphite is a much less effective moderator per collision (small $\\xi$), requiring more scattering events. During this larger number of collisions, the neutron also travels a greater distance between each collision (large $\\ell_{tr}$). Both of these effects compound to make the neutron wander much farther from its origin in graphite before thermalizing, resulting in a substantially larger Fermi age.",

Under scattering-dominated conditions where $\\Sigma_t^g \\approx \\Sigma_s^g$, the transport cross section is $\\Sigma_{tr}^g \\approx \\Sigma_s^g (1 - \\bar{\\mu}_g)$.\n\nThe diffusion coefficient in group $g$ can be modeled in two ways:\n- A transport-corrected diffusion coefficient $D_g^{(tr)} = \\dfrac{1}{3 \\Sigma_{tr}^g}$.\n- A non-transport diffusion coefficient $D_g^{(s)} = \\dfrac{1}{3 \\Sigma_s^g}$.\n\nIn age theory, the Fermi age $\\tau(u)$ accumulates according to the differential relation $\\dfrac{d\\tau}{du} = \\dfrac{D(u)}{\\xi(u)\\,\\Sigma_s(u)}$. In a multigroup discretization, the total age to reach a lethargy span is approximated by a Riemann sum over groups. Define the multigroup ages using each diffusion model:\n- $\\tau_G^{(tr)} = \\sum_{g=1}^{G} \\dfrac{D_g^{(tr)}}{\\xi_g \\Sigma_s^g} \\Delta u_g$.\n- $\\tau_G^{(s)} = \\sum_{g=1}^{G} \\dfrac{D_g^{(s)}}{\\xi_g \\Sigma_s^g} \\Delta u_g$.\n\nYour task is to implement the transport correction in the multigroup age theory by replacing $D_g$ with $D_g^{(tr)} = \\dfrac{1}{3 \\Sigma_{tr}^g}$ and to quantify the difference $\\Delta \\tau_G = \\tau_G^{(tr)} - \\tau_G^{(s)}$. Express all results in $\\text{cm}^2$.\n\nUse the following test suite of parameter sets. Each test case provides arrays for $\\Delta u_g$, $\\xi_g$, $\\Sigma_s^g$ (in $\\text{cm}^{-1}$), and $\\bar{\\mu}_g$, and specifies $G$ as the length of these arrays:\n\n- Test case $1$ (light water-like moderator, mildly forward-peaked scattering):\n  - $G = 5$\n  - $\\Delta u = [\\,2.0,\\,2.5,\\,2.0,\\,1.5,\\,2.0\\,]$\n  - $\\xi = [\\,0.94,\\,0.95,\\,0.96,\\,0.97,\\,0.98\\,]$\n  - $\\Sigma_s = [\\,0.35,\\,0.32,\\,0.30,\\,0.28,\\,0.26\\,]$ $\\text{cm}^{-1}$\n  - $\\bar{\\mu} = [\\,0.10,\\,0.12,\\,0.15,\\,0.18,\\,0.20\\,]$\n- Test case $2$ (isotropic scattering baseline, so $\\Sigma_{tr}^g = \\Sigma_s^g$):\n  - $G = 4$\n  - $\\Delta u = [\\,3.0,\\,3.0,\\,2.0,\\,2.0\\,]$\n  - $\\xi = [\\,1.00,\\,1.00,\\,1.00,\\,1.00\\,]$\n  - $\\Sigma_s = [\\,0.40,\\,0.35,\\,0.30,\\,0.25\\,]$ $\\text{cm}^{-1}$\n  - $\\bar{\\mu} = [\\,0.00,\\,0.00,\\,0.00,\\,0.00\\,]$\n- Test case $3$ (graphite-like moderator, strongly forward-peaked scattering):\n  - $G = 5$\n  - $\\Delta u = [\\,2.5,\\,2.5,\\,2.0,\\,1.5,\\,1.5\\,]$\n  - $\\xi = [\\,0.16,\\,0.16,\\,0.16,\\,0.16,\\,0.16\\,]$\n  - $\\Sigma_s = [\\,0.08,\\,0.09,\\,0.10,\\,0.11,\\,0.12\\,]$ $\\text{cm}^{-1}$\n  - $\\bar{\\mu} = [\\,0.70,\\,0.75,\\,0.80,\\,0.85,\\,0.90\\,]$\n- Test case $4$ (single-group boundary case):\n  - $G = 1$\n  - $\\Delta u = [\\,10.0\\,]$\n  - $\\xi = [\\,0.70\\,]$\n  - $\\Sigma_s = [\\,0.20\\,]$ $\\text{cm}^{-1}$\n  - $\\bar{\\mu} = [\\,0.50\\,]$\n\nAlgorithmic requirements:\n- For each test case, compute $\\Sigma_{tr}^g = \\Sigma_s^g (1 - \\bar{\\mu}_g)$ and then compute $\\tau_G^{(tr)}$ and $\\tau_G^{(s)}$ using the definitions above. Finally, compute $\\Delta \\tau_G = \\tau_G^{(tr)} - \\tau_G^{(s)}$ in $\\text{cm}^2$.\n- Treat all quantities as real numbers; there are no angle units to specify beyond the cosine input.\n- Numerically stable handling is expected; for $\\bar{\\mu}_g = 0$, $\\Sigma_{tr}^g = \\Sigma_s^g$.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, for the four test cases in order, each value rounded to six decimal places, for example $[\\,\\text{result1},\\text{result2},\\text{result3},\\text{result4}\\,]$.",

The formulas for the diffusion coefficient, transport cross section, and age are standard in nuclear reactor physics literature. All parameters ($\\Sigma_s$, $\\xi$, $\\bar{\\mu}$) are standard physical quantities, and their provided values are physically realistic for common moderating materials.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined. It asks for the computation of a specific quantity, $\\Delta \\tau_G$, using explicitly provided formulas and a complete set of input data for each test case. The calculation is deterministic, leading to a unique solution for each case.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, objective, and quantitative language. The task is a formal calculation, free of any subjective or opinion-based elements.\n- **No Flaws**: The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, feasible, well-structured, and non-trivial. The units are consistent: $\\Sigma_s$ is in $\\text{cm}^{-1}$, leading to $D$ in $\\text{cm}$. The age $\\tau$, defined as $\\int D/(\\xi \\Sigma_s) du$, correctly has units of $\\text{cm} \\cdot \\text{cm} = \\text{cm}^2$.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n## PRINCIPLE-BASED SOLUTION\n\nThe objective is to compute the difference in the multigroup Fermi age, $\\Delta \\tau_G$, resulting from the use of a transport-corrected diffusion coefficient versus a non-corrected one. The quantity to calculate is:\n$$\n\\Delta \\tau_G = \\tau_G^{(tr)} - \\tau_G^{(s)}\n$$\nSubstituting the given definitions for $\\tau_G^{(tr)}$ and $\\tau_G^{(s)}$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\tau_G = \\sum_{g=1}^{G} \\frac{D_g^{(tr)}}{\\xi_g \\Sigma_s^g} \\Delta u_g - \\sum_{g=1}^{G} \\frac{D_g^{(s)}}{\\xi_g \\Sigma_s^g} \\Delta u_g\n$$\nBy combining the summations, we get:\n$$\n\\Delta \\tau_G = \\sum_{g=1}^{G} \\left( D_g^{(tr)} - D_g^{(s)} \\right) \\frac{\\Delta u_g}{\\xi_g \\Sigma_s^g}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for the diffusion coefficients, $D_g^{(tr)}$ and $D_g^{(s)}$. The non-transport-corrected coefficient is $D_g^{(s)} = \\dfrac{1}{3 \\Sigma_s^g}$. The transport-corrected coefficient is $D_g^{(tr)} = \\dfrac{1}{3 \\Sigma_{tr}^g}$, where the transport cross section is defined as $\\Sigma_{tr}^g = \\Sigma_s^g (1 - \\bar{\\mu}_g)$.\nLet's analyze the difference in the diffusion coefficients:\n$$\nD_g^{(tr)} - D_g^{(s)} = \\frac{1}{3 \\Sigma_s^g (1 - \\bar{\\mu}_g)} - \\frac{1}{3 \\Sigma_s^g}\n$$\nFactoring out the common term $\\dfrac{1}{3 \\Sigma_s^g}$:\n$$\nD_g^{(tr)} - D_g^{(s)} = \\frac{1}{3 \\Sigma_s^g} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - \\bar{\\mu}_g} - 1 \\right)\n$$\nFinding a common denominator for the terms in the parenthesis:\n$$\nD_g^{(tr)} - D_g^{(s)} = \\frac{1}{3 \\Sigma_s^g} \\left( \\frac{1 - (1 - \\bar{\\mu}_g)}{1 - \\bar{\\mu}_g} \\right) = \\frac{1}{3 \\Sigma_s^g} \\left( \\frac{\\bar{\\mu}_g}{1 - \\bar{\\mu}_g} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this simplified expression back into the formula for $\\Delta \\tau_G$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\tau_G = \\sum_{g=1}^{G} \\left[ \\frac{1}{3 \\Sigma_s^g} \\left( \\frac{\\bar{\\mu}_g}{1 - \\bar{\\mu}_g} \\right) \\right] \\frac{\\Delta u_g}{\\xi_g \\Sigma_s^g}\n$$\nCombining terms yields the final expression for the per-group contribution to $\\Delta \\tau_G$ and the total sum:\n$$\n\\Delta \\tau_G = \\sum_{g=1}^{G} \\frac{\\Delta u_g \\cdot \\bar{\\mu}_g}{3 \\xi_g (\\Sigma_s^g)^2 (1 - \\bar{\\mu}_g)}\n$$\nThis form is computationally advantageous as it computes the difference directly, avoiding the subtraction of two potentially large and nearly equal numbers, which could lead to a loss of floating-point precision. It also transparently shows that if scattering is isotropic for a group ($\\bar{\\mu}_g = 0$), that group's contribution to the difference is zero, as expected.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n$1.$ For each test case, the input arrays for $\\Delta u_g$, $\\xi_g$, $\\Sigma_s^g$, and $\\bar{\\mu}_g$ are used.\n$2.$ For each group $g$ from $1$ to $G$, the term $\\dfrac{\\Delta u_g \\cdot \\bar{\\mu}_g}{3 \\xi_g (\\Sigma_s^g)^2 (1 - \\bar{\\mu}_g)}$ is calculated.\n$3.$ These terms are summed over all groups to obtain the total $\\Delta \\tau_G$ in $\\text{cm}^2$.\n$4.$ The final numerical result is rounded to six decimal places.\n\nThis procedure will be implemented for all four test cases provided. Vectorized operations are suitable for this task, where an array of per-group terms is computed element-wise and then summed.",
