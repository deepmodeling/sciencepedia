            "problem": "An electrical appliance is modeled as an on/off load with constant on-state real power $P_{\\text{on}} > 0$. Let $I(t) \\in \\{0,1\\}$ denote its state indicator at time $t$, where $I(t) = 1$ if the device is on and $I(t) = 0$ otherwise. The instantaneous real power is $p(t) = P_{\\text{on}} I(t)$.

            "solution": "The problem is first subjected to a validation check.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- An electrical appliance is modeled as an on/off load.\n- Constant on-state real power: $P_{\\text{on}} > 0$.\n- State indicator at time $t$: $I(t) \\in \\{0,1\\}$, where $I(t) = 1$ for 'on' and $I(t) = 0$ for 'off'.\n- Instantaneous real power: $p(t) = P_{\\text{on}} I(t)$.\n- Observation window duration: $T$.\n- $T$ is large relative to the device’s internal switching time scales.\n- Window-averaged power: $\\overline{P}_T = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} p(t) \\, dt$.\n- Duty fraction over this window: $D_T = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} I(t) \\, dt$.\n- $D_T$ is treated as a random variable $D$ across different windows.\n- The support of $D$ is $[0,1]$.\n- Mean of $D$: $\\mu_D = \\mathbb{E}[D] \\in (0,1]$.\n- Variance of $D$: $\\sigma_D^2 = \\operatorname{Var}(D) \\ge 0$.\n- An assumption is made that $T$ is sufficiently large, rendering within-window variability negligible compared to the slow variability of $D$.\n- The coefficient of variation for a random variable $X$ is defined as $CV_X = \\sigma_X / \\mu_X$.\n- The objective is to derive a closed-form expression for the coefficient of variation of the random window-averaged power, $CV_{\\overline{P}_T}$, in terms of $P_{\\text{on}}$, $\\mu_D$, and $\\sigma_D$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. The model of an intermittent load with a duty cycle is a standard and fundamental abstraction in electrical engineering and energy systems analysis. The treatment of the duty fraction as a random variable to account for slower, varying conditions (e.g., user behavior) is a valid and common modeling technique. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions (average power, duty fraction, mean, variance, coefficient of variation) and parameters to derive the desired quantity. The language is objective and mathematically precise. The problem is self-contained, consistent, and does not violate any physical or mathematical principles. It is a formalizable problem directly relevant to load characterization.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to find the coefficient of variation of the window-averaged power, $\\overline{P}_T$. This quantity is denoted as $CV_{\\overline{P}_T}$ and is defined as the ratio of its standard deviation to its mean:\n$$CV_{\\overline{P}_T} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\overline{P}_T}}{\\mu_{\\overline{P}_T}}$$\nWe must first find the mean, $\\mu_{\\overline{P}_T} = \\mathbb{E}[\\overline{P}_T]$, and the standard deviation, $\\sigma_{\\overline{P}_T} = \\sqrt{\\operatorname{Var}(\\overline{P}_T)}$, of the random variable $\\overline{P}_T$.\n\nFirst, we establish a direct relationship between the window-averaged power $\\overline{P}_T$ and the duty fraction $D_T$. By definition,\n$$\\overline{P}_T = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} p(t) \\, dt$$\nSubstituting the expression for instantaneous power, $p(t) = P_{\\text{on}} I(t)$, we get:\n$$\\overline{P}_T = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} P_{\\text{on}} I(t) \\, dt$$\nSince $P_{\\text{on}}$ is a constant, it can be factored out of the integral:\n$$\\overline{P}_T = P_{\\text{on}} \\left( \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} I(t) \\, dt \\right)$$\nThe term in the parentheses is the definition of the duty fraction, $D_T$. Thus, the window-averaged power is directly proportional to the duty fraction for that window:\n$$\\overline{P}_T = P_{\\text{on}} D_T$$\nThe problem states that due to slow variability, the duty fraction $D_T$ is considered a random variable $D$ when viewed across many windows. Consequently, $\\overline{P}_T$ is also a random variable, related to $D$ by the linear transformation $\\overline{P}_T = P_{\\text{on}} D$. We can now compute the statistical properties of $\\overline{P}_T$ using the known properties of $D$.\n\nNext, we calculate the mean of $\\overline{P}_T$. The mean, or expectation, of $\\overline{P}_T$ is:\n$$\\mu_{\\overline{P}_T} = \\mathbb{E}[\\overline{P}_T] = \\mathbb{E}[P_{\\text{on}} D]$$\nUsing the linearity property of the expectation operator, the constant $P_{\\text{on}}$ can be factored out:\n$$\\mu_{\\overline{P}_T} = P_{\\text{on}} \\mathbb{E}[D]$$\nThe problem gives $\\mathbb{E}[D] = \\mu_D$. Therefore, the mean of the window-averaged power is:\n$$\\mu_{\\overline{P}_T} = P_{\\text{on}} \\mu_D$$\nSince $P_{\\text{on}} > 0$ and $\\mu_D \\in (0,1]$, the mean power $\\mu_{\\overline{P}_T}$ is strictly positive.\n\nNow, we calculate the variance of $\\overline{P}_T$. The variance is defined as $\\sigma_{\\overline{P}_T}^2 = \\operatorname{Var}(\\overline{P}_T)$.\n$$\\sigma_{\\overline{P}_T}^2 = \\operatorname{Var}(\\overline{P}_T) = \\operatorname{Var}(P_{\\text{on}} D)$$\nUsing the property of variance, $\\operatorname{Var}(aX) = a^2 \\operatorname{Var}(X)$ for a constant $a$ and a random variable $X$, we have:\n$$\\sigma_{\\overline{P}_T}^2 = (P_{\\text{on}})^2 \\operatorname{Var}(D)$$\nThe problem gives $\\operatorname{Var}(D) = \\sigma_D^2$. Therefore, the variance of the window-averaged power is:\n$$\\sigma_{\\overline{P}_T}^2 = P_{\\text{on}}^2 \\sigma_D^2$$\nThe standard deviation, $\\sigma_{\\overline{P}_T}$, is the square root of the variance. Since standard deviation is non-negative and $P_{\\text{on}} > 0$, we have:\n$$\\sigma_{\\overline{P}_T} = \\sqrt{P_{\\text{on}}^2 \\sigma_D^2} = |P_{\\text{on}}| |\\sigma_D| = P_{\\text{on}} \\sigma_D$$\n\nFinally, we can compute the coefficient of variation of $\\overline{P}_T$ by substituting the expressions for the mean and standard deviation into its definition:\n$$CV_{\\overline{P}_T} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\overline{P}_T}}{\\mu_{\\overline{P}_T}} = \\frac{P_{\\text{on}} \\sigma_D}{P_{\\text{on}} \\mu_D}$$\nThe constant term $P_{\\text{on}}$ appears in both the numerator and the denominator. Since $P_{\\text{on}} > 0$, we can cancel it:\n$$CV_{\\overline{P}_T} = \\frac{\\sigma_D}{\\mu_D}$$\nThis expression gives the coefficient of variation of the window-averaged power solely in terms of the statistical properties of the duty fraction, $\\mu_D$ and $\\sigma_D$. The result is independent of the on-state power level, $P_{\\text{on}}$. This indicates that the relative variability of the average power is identical to the relative variability of the duty fraction itself. The result is dimensionless, as both $\\sigma_D$ and $\\mu_D$ are dimensionless quantities.",

The problem is well-posed, asking for a verification of which of the given options satisfies all axioms. It is objective and self-contained, with all necessary terms defined. The consideration of measurement noise makes the problem statement more realistic and practically relevant. There are no scientific or logical contradictions, no ambiguities, and the problem is not trivial.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived by systematically evaluating each candidate option against the six specified axioms.\n\n### Derivation and Option Evaluation\n\nLet us denote the normalization factor $\\Delta P = P_{\\text{on}} - P_{\\text{standby}}$. From the givens, we know $\\Delta P > 0$.\n\n#### Evaluation of Option A\n$M_A[P(\\cdot)] \\;=\\; \\dfrac{1}{T\\left(P_{\\text{on}}-P_{\\text{standby}}\\right)} \\displaystyle\\int_{0}^{T} \\Big(P(t)-P_{\\text{standby}}\\Big)\\,dt$\n\n1.  **Baseline invariance**: If $P(t) = P_{\\text{standby}}$, the integrand is $P_{\\text{standby}} - P_{\\text{standby}} = 0$. The integral is $0$, thus $M_A = 0$. This axiom is satisfied.\n2.  **On-state normalization**: If $P(t) = P_{\\text{on}}$, the integrand is $P_{\\text{on}} - P_{\\text{standby}}$. The integral becomes $\\int_{0}^{T} (P_{\\text{on}} - P_{\\text{standby}}) \\,dt = T(P_{\\text{on}} - P_{\\text{standby}})$. Thus, $M_A = \\frac{T(P_{\\text{on}} - P_{\\text{standby}})}{T(P_{\\text{on}} - P_{\\text{standby}})} = 1$. This axiom is satisfied.\n3.  **Exactness for two-level behavior**: Let the total time at $P_{\\text{on}}$ be $t_{\\text{on}}$. The integral splits into two parts: $\\int_{t \\text{ where } P=P_{\\text{on}}} (P_{\\text{on}}-P_{\\text{standby}}) \\,dt + \\int_{t \\text{ where } P=P_{\\text{standby}}} (P_{\\text{standby}}-P_{\\text{standby}}) \\,dt = t_{\\text{on}}(P_{\\text{on}}-P_{\\text{standby}}) + 0$. Thus, $M_A = \\frac{t_{\\text{on}}(P_{\\text{on}}-P_{\\text{standby}})}{T(P_{\\text{on}}-P_{\\text{standby}})} = \\frac{t_{\\text{on}}}{T}$. This axiom is satisfied.\n4.  **Nonnegativity under measurement noise**: If there is an interval where $P(t)  P_{\\text{standby}}$, the integrand $P(t)-P_{\\text{standby}}$ will be negative on that interval. If the integral of these negative parts is large enough to dominate any positive parts, the total integral can be negative. Since $T > 0$ and $P_{\\text{on}}-P_{\\text{standby}} > 0$, a negative integral results in a negative metric $M_A$. This axiom is **not satisfied**.\n\nBecause Option A fails Axiom 4, it is **Incorrect**.\n\n#### Evaluation of Option B\n$M_B[P(\\cdot)] \\;=\\; \\dfrac{1}{T} \\displaystyle\\int_{0}^{T} \\mathbb{1}\\!\\left\\{P(t)\\ge P_{\\text{on}}\\right\\} \\, dt$\n\n1.  **Baseline invariance**: If $P(t) = P_{\\text{standby}}$, then since $P_{\\text{standby}}  P_{\\text{on}}$, the condition $P(t)\\ge P_{\\text{on}}$ is never met. The integrand $\\mathbb{1}\\{P(t)\\ge P_{\\text{on}}\\}$ is $0$ for all $t$. The integral is $0$, so $M_B = 0$. This axiom is satisfied.\n2.  **On-state normalization**: If $P(t) = P_{\\text{on}}$, the condition $P(t)\\ge P_{\\text{on}}$ is always met. The integrand is $1$ for all $t$. The integral is $\\int_{0}^{T} 1 \\,dt = T$. Thus, $M_B = \\frac{T}{T} = 1$. This axiom is satisfied.\n3.  **Exactness for two-level behavior**: If $P(t) \\in \\{P_{\\text{standby}},P_{\\text{on}}\\}$, the integrand $\\mathbb{1}\\{P(t)\\ge P_{\\text{on}}\\}$ is $1$ only when $P(t)=P_{\\text{on}}$ and $0$ when $P(t)=P_{\\text{standby}}$. The integral measures the total time for which $P(t)=P_{\\text{on}}$, which is $t_{\\text{on}}$. Thus, $M_B = \\frac{t_{\\text{on}}}{T}$. This axiom is satisfied.\n4.  **Nonnegativity under measurement noise**: The integrand $\\mathbb{1}\\{\\cdot\\}$ is by definition either $0$ or $1$, so it is non-negative. The integral of a non-negative function is non-negative. Thus, $M_B \\ge 0$. This axiom is satisfied.\n5.  **Graded proportionality**: Consider the regime $P_{\\text{standby}}  P(t) \\le P_{\\text{on}}$. For any time $t$ where $P(t)$ is strictly less than $P_{\\text{on}}$, the condition $P(t) \\ge P_{\\text{on}}$ is false, and the integrand is $0$. This means that all power levels between $P_{\\text{standby}}$ and $P_{\\text{on}}$ are treated as 'off', contributing nothing to the metric. The instantaneous contribution does not scale with $P(t)-P_{\\text{standby}}$; it is always $0$. This axiom is **not satisfied**.\n\nBecause Option B fails Axiom 5, it is **Incorrect**.\n\n#### Evaluation of Option C\n$M_C[P(\\cdot)] \\;=\\; \\dfrac{1}{T\\left(P_{\\text{on}}-P_{\\text{standby}}\\right)} \\displaystyle\\int_{0}^{T} \\Big(P(t)-P_{\\text{standby}}\\Big)_{+}\\,dt$\n\n1.  **Baseline invariance**: If $P(t) = P_{\\text{standby}}$, the integrand is $(P_{\\text{standby}} - P_{\\text{standby}})_+ = (0)_+ = 0$. The integral is $0$, so $M_C = 0$. This axiom is satisfied.\n2.  **On-state normalization**: If $P(t) = P_{\\text{on}}$, the integrand is $(P_{\\text{on}} - P_{\\text{standby}})_+$. Since $P_{\\text{on}} > P_{\\text{standby}}$, this equals $P_{\\text{on}} - P_{\\text{standby}}$. The integral is $T(P_{\\text{on}} - P_{\\text{standby}})$. Thus, $M_C = \\frac{T(P_{\\text{on}}-P_{\\text{standby}})}{T(P_{\\text{on}}-P_{\\text{standby}})} = 1$. This axiom is satisfied.\n3.  **Exactness for two-level behavior**: If $P(t) \\in \\{P_{\\text{standby}},P_{\\text{on}}\\}$, the integrand $(P(t)-P_{\\text{standby}})_+$ is $0$ when $P(t)=P_{\\text{standby}}$ and $P_{\\text{on}}-P_{\\text{standby}}$ when $P(t)=P_{\\text{on}}$. The integral is therefore $\\int_{t \\text{ where } P=P_{\\text{on}}} (P_{\\text{on}}-P_{\\text{standby}}) \\,dt = t_{\\text{on}}(P_{\\text{on}}-P_{\\text{standby}})$. So $M_C = \\frac{t_{\\text{on}}(P_{\\text{on}}-P_{\\text{standby}})}{T(P_{\\text{on}}-P_{\\text{standby}})} = \\frac{t_{\\text{on}}}{T}$. This axiom is satisfied.\n4.  **Nonnegativity under measurement noise**: The integrand is $(P(t)-P_{\\text{standby}})_+ = \\max\\{P(t)-P_{\\text{standby}}, 0\\}$. By definition, this term is always non-negative. The integral of a non-negative function is non-negative, and the pre-factor is positive. Thus, $M_C \\ge 0$ is always true. This axiom is satisfied.\n5.  **Graded proportionality**: In the regime $P_{\\text{standby}}  P(t) \\le P_{\\text{on}}$, the quantity $P(t)-P_{\\text{standby}}$ is positive. Then, by definition of the positive-part function, $(P(t)-P_{\\text{standby}})_+ = P(t)-P_{\\text{standby}}$. The instantaneous contribution to the integral is therefore linear in the excess power $P(t)-P_{\\text{standby}}$. This axiom is satisfied.\n6.  **Upper bound under nominal on-cap**: If $P(t) \\le P_{\\text{on}}$ for almost every $t$, then $P(t)-P_{\\text{standby}} \\le P_{\\text{on}}-P_{\\text{standby}}$. The positive-part function is monotonically non-decreasing, so $(P(t)-P_{\\text{standby}})_+ \\le (P_{\\text{on}}-P_{\\text{standby}})_+ = P_{\\text{on}}-P_{\\text{standby}}$. Integrating this inequality over $[0,T]$ gives $\\int_{0}^{T} (P(t)-P_{\\text{standby}})_+ \\,dt \\le \\int_{0}^{T} (P_{\\text{on}}-P_{\\text{standby}}) \\,dt = T(P_{\\text{on}}-P_{\\text{standby}})$. Dividing by $T(P_{\\text{on}}-P_{\\text{standby}})$ yields $M_C \\le 1$. Combined with Axiom 4 ($M_C \\ge 0$), we have $M_C \\in [0,1]$. This axiom is satisfied.\n\nOption C satisfies all six axioms. It is therefore **Correct**.\n\n#### Evaluation of Option D\n$M_D[P(\\cdot)] \\;=\\; \\dfrac{1}{T\\,P_{\\text{on}}} \\displaystyle\\int_{0}^{T} P(t)\\,dt$\n\n1.  **Baseline invariance**: If $P(t) = P_{\\text{standby}}$, the integral is $\\int_0^T P_{\\text{standby}} dt = T P_{\\text{standby}}$. The metric becomes $M_D = \\frac{T P_{\\text{standby}}}{T P_{\\text{on}}} = \\frac{P_{\\text{standby}}}{P_{\\text{on}}}$. The problem states $P_{\\text{on}} > P_{\\text{standby}} \\ge 0$. Unless $P_{\\text{standby}}=0$, $M_D$ will be greater than $0$. The axiom requires the metric to be $0$. This axiom is **not satisfied** in the general case where $P_{\\text{standby}} > 0$.\n2.  **On-state normalization**: If $P(t)=P_{\\text{on}}$, the integral is $T P_{\\text{on}}$, so $M_D = \\frac{T P_{\\text{on}}}{T P_{\\text{on}}} = 1$. This axiom is satisfied.\n3.  **Exactness for two-level behavior**: With on-time $t_{\\text{on}}$ and off-time $t_{\\text{off}}=T-t_{\\text{on}}$, the integral is $\\int P(t)dt = P_{\\text{on}}t_{\\text{on}} + P_{\\text{standby}}t_{\\text{off}} = P_{\\text{on}}t_{\\text{on}} + P_{\\text{standby}}(T-t_{\\text{on}})$. The metric is $M_D = \\frac{P_{\\text{on}}t_{\\text{on}} + P_{\\text{standby}}(T-t_{\\text{on}})}{T P_{\\text{on}}} = \\frac{t_{\\text{on}}}{T} + \\frac{P_{\\text{standby}}}{P_{\\text{on}}}(1-\\frac{t_{\\text{on}}}{T})$. This is not equal to $\\frac{t_{\\text{on}}}{T}$ unless $P_{\\text{standby}}=0$ or $t_{\\text{on}}=T$. This axiom is **not satisfied** in general.\n4.  **Nonnegativity under measurement noise**: The problem states $P(t) \\ge 0$. The integral of a non-negative function is non-negative. As $T > 0$ and $P_{\\text{on}} > 0$, $M_D \\ge 0$. This axiom is satisfied.\n5.  **Graded proportionality**: The integrand is $P(t)$. This is not a function of the excess power $P(t)-P_{\\text{standby}}$. It does not isolate the power consumption above the baseline. This axiom is **not satisfied**.\n\nBecause Option D fails Axioms 1, 3, and 5, it is **Incorrect**.\n\nConclusion: Only option C satisfies all the required axioms for a robust duty cycle metric. The use of the positive-part function, $(x)_+$, is crucial for handling potential measurement noise (Axiom 4), while the subtraction of the baseline $P_{\\text{standby}}$ and normalization by the dynamic range $P_{\\text{on}}-P_{\\text{standby}}$ ensure proper scaling and boundary conditions (Axioms 1, 2, 5, 6).",

            "problem": "An industrial Variable Speed Drive (VSD) supplies a three-phase motor from a stiff grid with approximately constant line-to-line voltage and near-unity power factor over its operating range. Consider two one-hour duty cycles that deliver the same net energy to the driven process. The VSD and upstream conductors are thermally limited primarily by conduction-related losses that scale with the square of electrical current. Assume that over the operating range, electrical input current is approximately proportional to electrical input power, so that internal Joule heating and conduction losses scale proportionally to the time integral of the square of input power. Also assume that the thermal time constant of the limiting component is much longer than the cycle duration, so that cumulative energy of losses is the relevant severity measure.\n\nLet the rated input power of the VSD be $P_{\\text{rated}} = 10\\,\\text{kW}$. Define two duty cycles over a duration of $T = 1\\,\\text{h}$:\n\n- Profile A: Constant input power $P(t) = 5\\,\\text{kW}$ for all $t \\in [0,T]$.\n- Profile B: Square-wave input power taking values $P(t) = 10\\,\\text{kW}$ for $t \\in [0,0.5T)$ and $P(t) = 0\\,\\text{kW}$ for $t \\in [0.5T,T]$.\n\nBoth profiles deliver the same net energy $\\int_{0}^{T} P(t)\\,dt$.\n\nA commonly used utilization factor is defined as the ratio of average input power to rated input power. In practice, this factor is often used to classify duty severity. You are asked to assess whether this factor appropriately captures thermal severity under the above assumptions for variable-speed operation and, if not, to evaluate a corrected severity metric that penalizes power peaks consistent with the assumed loss mechanism.\n\nWhich of the following statements are correct?\n\nA. Because both profiles have the same average input power, the utilization factor correctly infers that the quadratically scaling thermal severity is identical for both profiles.\n\nB. A dimensionless corrected severity metric that is consistent with the assumed loss mechanism and that normalizes by energy throughput and rated power yields, for these two profiles, values $M_{\\text{A}} = 0.5$ and $M_{\\text{B}} = 1.0$, thereby ranking Profile B as more severe.\n\nC. Under the stated assumptions, cumulative conduction-related thermal losses over the cycle scale with $\\int_{0}^{T} P(t)\\,dt$, hence both profiles are thermally equivalent.\n\nD. If the input power waveform $P(t)$ is multiplied by a constant amplitude factor $c>0$ while $P_{\\text{rated}}$ is held fixed, the corrected severity metric remains invariant.\n\nE.

It is scientifically sound, self-consistent, well-posed, and based on reasonable and clearly stated physical assumptions. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core of the problem is to compare the thermal severity of two duty cycles. According to the problem statement, thermal severity is determined by the cumulative energy of losses, which is proportional to the time integral of the square of the input power. Let the constant of proportionality be $k$.\n$$E_{\\text{loss}} = k \\int_{0}^{T} P(t)^2 \\,dt$$\nTo compare the severity of different profiles, we need to calculate this integral for each. It is convenient to work with the root-mean-square (RMS) power, as its square is directly proportional to the average rate of loss energy generation.\nThe average power is $P_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} P(t)\\,dt$.\nThe mean square power is $P_{\\text{RMS}}^2 = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} P^2(t)\\,dt$.\nThus, the total loss energy is $E_{\\text{loss}} = k \\cdot T \\cdot P_{\\text{RMS}}^2$. For a fixed duration $T$, the thermal severity is proportional to $P_{\\text{RMS}}^2$.\n\n**Calculations for Profile A:**\nThe power is constant, $P_A(t) = 5\\,\\text{kW}$.\nThe average power is:\n$$P_{A, \\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} 5 \\,dt = 5\\,\\text{kW}$$\nThe mean square power is:\n$$P_{A, \\text{RMS}}^2 = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} (5)^2 \\,dt = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} 25 \\,dt = 25\\,(\\text{kW})^2$$\n\n**Calculations for Profile B:**\nThe power is a square wave, $P_B(t) = 10\\,\\text{kW}$ for $t \\in [0, 0.5T)$ and $P_B(t) = 0\\,\\text{kW}$ for $t \\in [0.5T, T]$.\nThe average power is:\n$$P_{B, \\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{T} \\left( \\int_{0}^{0.5T} 10 \\,dt + \\int_{0.5T}^{T} 0 \\,dt \\right) = \\frac{1}{T} (10 \\cdot 0.5T) = 5\\,\\text{kW}$$\nThe mean square power is:\n$$P_{B, \\text{RMS}}^2 = \\frac{1}{T} \\left( \\int_{0}^{0.5T} (10)^2 \\,dt + \\int_{0.5T}^{T} (0)^2 \\,dt \\right) = \\frac{1}{T} (100 \\cdot 0.5T) = 50\\,(\\text{kW})^2$$\n\n**Comparison of Thermal Severity:**\nThe thermal severity is proportional to $P_{\\text{RMS}}^2$.\nFor Profile A, severity is proportional to $25\\,(\\text{kW})^2$.\nFor Profile B, severity is proportional to $50\\,(\\text{kW})^2$.\nProfile B is twice as thermally severe as Profile A, despite having the same average power.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Because both profiles have the same average input power, the utilization factor correctly infers that the quadratically scaling thermal severity is identical for both profiles.**\nBoth profiles have $P_{\\text{avg}} = 5\\,\\text{kW}$. The rated power is $P_{\\text{rated}} = 10\\,\\text{kW}$. The utilization factor for both is $\\frac{5\\,\\text{kW}}{10\\,\\text{kW}} = 0.5$. If this factor were a correct measure of thermal severity, it would imply the severities are identical. However, our analysis showed that the thermal severity (proportional to $P_{\\text{RMS}}^2$) is $25\\,(\\text{kW})^2$ for Profile A and $50\\,(\\text{kW})^2$ for Profile B. The severities are not identical. Therefore, the utilization factor based on average power is an incorrect measure for this loss mechanism.\nVerdict: Incorrect.\n\n**B. A dimensionless corrected severity metric that is consistent with the assumed loss mechanism and that normalizes by energy throughput and rated power yields, for these two profiles, values $M_{\\text{A}} = 0.5$ and $M_{\\text{B}} = 1.0$, thereby ranking Profile B as more severe.**\nA metric consistent with the loss mechanism must be proportional to the total loss energy, $\\int_{0}^{T} P(t)^2\\,dt$. The energy throughput is $E_{\\text{net}} = \\int_{0}^{T} P(t)\\,dt$. Normalizing by energy throughput and rated power suggests a metric of the form:\n$$M = \\frac{\\int_{0}^{T} P(t)^2\\,dt}{(\\int_{0}^{T} P(t)\\,dt) \\cdot P_{\\text{rated}}}$$\nLet's compute this for both profiles. We know $P_{\\text{rated}} = 10\\,\\text{kW}$ and $\\int_{0}^{T} P(t)\\,dt = (5\\,\\text{kW}) \\cdot T$ for both.\nFor Profile A:\n$$M_A = \\frac{\\int_{0}^{T} (5)^2\\,dt}{(5T) \\cdot 10} = \\frac{25T}{50T} = 0.5$$\nFor Profile B:\n$$M_B = \\frac{\\int_{0}^{0.5T} (10)^2\\,dt}{(5T) \\cdot 10} = \\frac{100 \\cdot (0.5T)}{50T} = \\frac{50T}{50T} = 1.0$$\nThe calculated values $M_A = 0.5$ and $M_B = 1.0$ match the statement. This metric correctly ranks Profile B ($M_B=1.0$) as more severe than Profile A ($M_A=0.5$).\nVerdict: Correct.\n\n**C. Under the stated assumptions, cumulative conduction-related thermal losses over the cycle scale with $\\int_{0}^{T} P(t)\\,dt$, hence both profiles are thermally equivalent.**\nThis statement is a direct contradiction of the problem's premises. The problem explicitly states that losses scale with the square of the current, and current is proportional to power. Therefore, cumulative losses scale with $\\int_{0}^{T} P(t)^2\\,dt$, not with $\\int_{0}^{T} P(t)\\,dt$. Since the integral of $P(t)$ is the same for both profiles but the integral of $P(t)^2$ is not, the thermal equivalence conclusion is false.\nVerdict: Incorrect.\n\n**D. If the input power waveform $P(t)$ is multiplied by a constant amplitude factor $c>0$ while $P_{\\text{rated}}$ is held fixed, the corrected severity metric remains invariant.**\nLet the new waveform be $P'(t) = c \\cdot P(t)$. The corrected metric from option B is $M = \\frac{\\int_{0}^{T} P(t)^2\\,dt}{(\\int_{0}^{T} P(t)\\,dt) \\cdot P_{\\text{rated}}}$. Let's compute the new metric $M'$ for the waveform $P'(t)$:\n$$M' = \\frac{\\int_{0}^{T} (P'(t))^2\\,dt}{(\\int_{0}^{T} P'(t)\\,dt) \\cdot P_{\\text{rated}}} = \\frac{\\int_{0}^{T} (c \\cdot P(t))^2\\,dt}{(\\int_{0}^{T} c \\cdot P(t)\\,dt) \\cdot P_{\\text{rated}}}$$\n$$M' = \\frac{c^2 \\int_{0}^{T} P(t)^2\\,dt}{c \\int_{0}^{T} P(t)\\,dt \\cdot P_{\\text{rated}}} = c \\left( \\frac{\\int_{0}^{T} P(t)^2\\,dt}{(\\int_{0}^{T} P(t)\\,dt) \\cdot P_{\\text{rated}}} \\right) = c \\cdot M$$\nThe metric $M'$ is equal to $c \\cdot M$, not $M$. Thus, the metric is not invariant; it scales linearly with the factor $c$.\nVerdict: Incorrect.\n\n**E. The corrected severity metric in statement B can be equivalently written as the ratio $\\dfrac{P_{\\text{RMS}}^{2}}{P_{\\text{rated}}\\,P_{\\text{avg}}}$, where $P_{\\text{RMS}}^{2} \\equiv \\dfrac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} P^{2}(t)\\,dt$ and $P_{\\text{avg}} \\equiv \\dfrac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} P(t)\\,dt$.**\nLet's substitute the definitions of $P_{\\text{RMS}}^2$ and $P_{\\text{avg}}$ into the given ratio:\n$$\\frac{P_{\\text{RMS}}^{2}}{P_{\\text{rated}}\\,P_{\\text{avg}}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} P(t)^2\\,dt}{P_{\\text{rated}} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} P(t)\\,dt\\right)}$$\nThe factor of $\\frac{1}{T}$ in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving:\n$$\\frac{\\int_{0}^{T} P(t)^2\\,dt}{P_{\\text{rated}} \\cdot \\int_{0}^{T} P(t)\\,dt}$$\nThis expression is identical to the one we formulated for the corrected severity metric $M$ in the analysis of option B. Therefore, the statement is a correct algebraic reformulation of the metric.\nVerdict: Correct.",
