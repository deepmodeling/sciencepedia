            "problem": "Consider a single-hour economic dispatch problem for an isolated power system with two thermal generators. Let the decision variables be the real-time power outputs $g_1$ and $g_2$ (in $\\mathrm{MW}$) of Generator $1$ and Generator $2$, respectively. The system operator seeks to minimize the total variable operating cost over the hour subject to a fixed demand balance and generator operating limits. Assume linear marginal costs given by the constant coefficients $c_1$ and $c_2$, respectively, and a perfectly inelastic demand $d$.\n\nFormulate the optimization problem by minimizing the linear cost function $f(g_1,g_2)$ subject to the physical constraints described below.

            "solution": "The user has provided a well-posed problem statement. All required data are present, the premises are scientifically sound, and the objective is clearly defined. The problem is a standard economic dispatch formulation, which is a classic application of constrained optimization in energy systems engineering. Therefore, a solution can be derived.\n\nThe problem is to determine the optimal power output of two generators, $g_1$ and $g_2$, to meet a fixed demand $d$ at minimum cost. The operating cost is linear with respect to the power output.\n\nFirst, we formulate the optimization problem. The objective function $f(g_1, g_2)$ to be minimized is the total hourly operating cost, which is the sum of the costs for each generator. Given constant marginal costs $c_1$ and $c_2$, the cost function is:\n$$ f(g_1, g_2) = c_1 g_1 + c_2 g_2 $$\nThis objective is subject to several constraints:\n1.  **Power Balance Constraint**: The total generation must exactly meet the demand $d$. This is an equality constraint:\n    $$ g_1 + g_2 = d $$\n2.  **Generator Capacity Constraints**: Each generator $i$ has a minimum output of $0$ $\\mathrm{MW}$ and a maximum output of $120$ $\\mathrm{MW}$. These are inequality constraints:\n    $$ 0 \\le g_1 \\le 120 $$\n    $$ 0 \\le g_2 \\le 120 $$\n\nThe full optimization problem is:\n$$ \\min_{g_1, g_2} \\quad c_1 g_1 + c_2 g_2 $$\nSubject to:\n$$ g_1 + g_2 - d = 0 $$\n$$ -g_1 \\le 0 $$\n$$ g_1 - 120 \\le 0 $$\n$$ -g_2 \\le 0 $$\n$$ g_2 - 120 \\le 0 $$\n\nThis is a linear programming problem, which is a special class of convex optimization problems. For such problems, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are both necessary and sufficient for optimality. We form the Lagrangian function $\\mathcal{L}$ by incorporating the constraints, weighted by their respective Lagrange multipliers. Let $\\lambda$ be the multiplier for the equality constraint, and let $\\mu_{1,\\text{min}}, \\mu_{1,\\text{max}}, \\mu_{2,\\text{min}}, \\mu_{2,\\text{max}}$ be the non-negative multipliers for the four inequality constraints.\n\n$$ \\mathcal{L}(g_1, g_2, \\lambda, \\vec{\\mu}) = c_1 g_1 + c_2 g_2 - \\lambda(g_1 + g_2 - d) + \\mu_{1,\\text{min}}(-g_1) + \\mu_{1,\\text{max}}(g_1 - 120) + \\mu_{2,\\text{min}}(-g_2) + \\mu_{2,\\text{max}}(g_2 - 120) $$\n\nThe KKT conditions for an optimal solution $(g_1^{\\star}, g_2^{\\star})$ are:\n\n1.  **Stationarity**: The gradient of the Lagrangian with respect to the decision variables must be zero at the optimal point.\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial g_1} = c_1 - \\lambda - \\mu_{1,\\text{min}} + \\mu_{1,\\text{max}} = 0 $$\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial g_2} = c_2 - \\lambda - \\mu_{2,\\text{min}} + \\mu_{2,\\text{max}} = 0 $$\n\n2.  **Primal Feasibility**: The optimal solution must satisfy all original constraints.\n    $$ g_1^{\\star} + g_2^{\\star} = d $$\n    $$ 0 \\le g_1^{\\star} \\le 120 $$\n    $$ 0 \\le g_2^{\\star} \\le 120 $$\n\n3.  **Dual Feasibility**: The multipliers for the inequality constraints must be non-negative.\n    $$ \\mu_{1,\\text{min}}, \\mu_{1,\\text{max}}, \\mu_{2,\\text{min}}, \\mu_{2,\\text{max}} \\ge 0 $$\n\n4.  **Complementary Slackness**: The product of each inequality multiplier and its corresponding slack must be zero.\n    $$ \\mu_{1,\\text{min}} g_1^{\\star} = 0 $$\n    $$ \\mu_{1,\\text{max}} (g_1^{\\star} - 120) = 0 $$\n    $$ \\mu_{2,\\text{min}} g_2^{\\star} = 0 $$\n    $$ \\mu_{2,\\text{max}} (g_2^{\\star} - 120) = 0 $$\n\nFrom the stationarity and complementary slackness conditions, we can derive the economic dispatch logic for each generator $i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$:\nThe rearranged stationarity condition is $c_i - \\lambda = \\mu_{i,\\text{min}} - \\mu_{i,\\text{max}}$.\n- If generator $i$ operates strictly between its limits ($0  g_i^{\\star}  120$), complementary slackness implies $\\mu_{i,\\text{min}}=0$ and $\\mu_{i,\\text{max}}=0$. Thus, $c_i - \\lambda = 0$, or $\\lambda = c_i$. Such a generator is called a marginal unit, as its cost sets the system marginal price $\\lambda$.\n- If generator $i$ is at its lower limit ($g_i^{\\star} = 0$), then $\\mu_{i,\\text{max}}=0$. The stationarity condition becomes $c_i - \\lambda = \\mu_{i,\\text{min}}$. Since $\\mu_{i,\\text{min}} \\ge 0$, this implies $\\lambda \\le c_i$.\n- If generator $i$ is at its upper limit ($g_i^{\\star} = 120$), then $\\mu_{i,\\text{min}}=0$. The stationarity condition becomes $c_i - \\lambda = -\\mu_{i,\\text{max}}$. Since $\\mu_{i,\\text{max}} \\ge 0$, this implies $\\lambda \\ge c_i$.\n\nThe data provided are: $c_1 = 20$ $\\mathrm{\\$/MWh}$, $c_2 = 40$ $\\mathrm{\\$/MWh}$, $d = 100$ $\\mathrm{MW}$, and capacity bounds are $[0, 120]$ $\\mathrm{MW}$ for both generators.\n\nSince $c_1  c_2$, Generator 1 is the cheaper unit. The principle of economic dispatch is to maximize the use of the cheapest available generator to meet demand. The demand is $d=100$ $\\mathrm{MW}$. The capacity of Generator 1 is $120$ $\\mathrm{MW}$. Since the capacity of the cheaper generator is sufficient to meet the entire demand ($120 > 100$), the optimal dispatch will use only Generator 1.\n\nThe proposed optimal dispatch is:\n$$ g_1^{\\star} = 100 \\ \\mathrm{MW} $$\n$$ g_2^{\\star} = 0 \\ \\mathrm{MW} $$\n\nWe now verify this solution using the KKT conditions and determine the value of $\\lambda^{\\star}$.\n- **Primal Feasibility**: $g_1^{\\star} + g_2^{\\star} = 100 + 0 = 100 = d$. The outputs $100$ and $0$ are within the $[0, 120]$ bounds. The solution is feasible.\n\n- **Optimality Conditions for $g_1^{\\star}$**:\nSince $0  g_1^{\\star} = 100  120$, Generator 1 is a marginal unit. For this to be optimal, its marginal cost must equal the system marginal price $\\lambda^{\\star}$.\n$$ \\lambda^{\\star} = c_1 = 20 \\ \\mathrm{\\$/MWh} $$\nThis also implies from complementary slackness that $\\mu_{1,\\text{min}} = 0$ and $\\mu_{1,\\text{max}} = 0$.\n\n- **Optimality Conditions for $g_2^{\\star}$**:\nSince $g_2^{\\star} = 0$, Generator 2 is at its lower limit. The optimality condition for this case is $\\lambda^{\\star} \\le c_2$.\nWe have $\\lambda^{\\star} = 20$ and $c_2 = 40$. The condition $20 \\le 40$ is satisfied. This confirms that it is not economic to dispatch the more expensive generator. From the stationarity condition for $g_2$, since $g_2^{\\star}=0$, we have $\\mu_{2,\\text{max}}=0$ and $c_2 - \\lambda^{\\star} = \\mu_{2,\\text{min}}$. This gives $\\mu_{2,\\text{min}} = 40 - 20 = 20$. Since $\\mu_{2,\\text{min}} \\ge 0$, the dual feasibility condition is satisfied.\n\nAll KKT conditions are satisfied for the dispatch $(g_1^{\\star}, g_2^{\\star}) = (100, 0)$ with the shadow price $\\lambda^{\\star} = 20$. The shadow price $\\lambda^{\\star}$, also known as the system marginal price or locational marginal price in a single-node system, represents the cost to supply one additional megawatt-hour of energy. In this case, that incremental energy would be supplied by Generator 1, so the marginal cost is $c_1$.\n\nThe value of the shadow price $\\lambda^{\\star}$ is $20$ $\\mathrm{\\$/MWh}$.",

Since $C(g_1)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $g_1$, its minimum value on the interval $[0, 10]$ will be attained at the largest possible value of $g_1$.\nTherefore, the optimal value for $g_1$ is:\n$$\ng_1^{\\star} = 10\n$$\nNow, we find the corresponding optimal value for $g_2$ using the energy balance equation:\n$$\ng_2^{\\star} = 100 - g_1^{\\star} = 100 - 10 = 90\n$$\nThe optimal dispatch is $(g_1^{\\star}, g_2^{\\star}) = (10, 90)$.\n\nThis solution is globally optimal. The problem is a linear program, meaning it involves the optimization of a linear objective function subject to linear equality and inequality constraints. The set of all feasible solutions (the feasible region) for an LP is a convex set. For such a problem, a fundamental theorem of linear programming states that if an optimal solution exists, it must occur at one of the vertices (extreme points) of the feasible region.\n\nThe feasible region here is a line segment in the $(g_1, g_2)$ plane. Its endpoints (vertices) are found by the intersection of the line $g_1 + g_2 = 100$ with the boundaries of the non-negativity and emission constraints.\nThe feasible range for $g_1$ is $[0, 10]$.\n*   At $g_1=0$, we have $g_2 = 100$. This gives the vertex $(0, 100)$.\n*   At $g_1=10$, we have $g_2 = 90$. This gives the vertex $(10, 90)$.\n\nEvaluating the cost function at these two vertices:\n*   Cost at $(0, 100)$: $C(0, 100) = 30(0) + 50(100) = 5000$.\n*   Cost at $(10, 90)$: $C(10, 90) = 30(10) + 50(90) = 300 + 4500 = 4800$.\n\nThe minimum cost is $4800$, which occurs at $(10, 90)$.

We use the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions to find the solution.\n\nThe Lagrangian $L$ for this problem is:\n$$L(\\mathbf{g}, \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}) = \\sum_{t=1}^{3} (g_t - d_t)^2 + \\sum_{i=1}^{8} \\lambda_i h_i(\\mathbf{g})$$\nwhere $h_i(\\mathbf{g}) \\leq 0$ represent the eight inequality constraints (note: using $h_i$ to avoid confusion with generation $g_t$):\n$h_1: g_1 - 20 \\leq 0$\n$h_2: -g_1 \\leq 0$\n$h_3: g_2 - g_1 - 20 \\leq 0$\n$h_4: g_1 - g_2 - 30 \\leq 0$\n$h_5: g_3 - g_2 - 20 \\leq 0$\n$h_6: g_2 - g_3 - 30 \\leq 0$\n$h_7: -g_2 \\leq 0$\n$h_8: -g_3 \\leq 0$\n\nThe stationarity conditions ($\\nabla_{\\mathbf{g}} L = 0$) are:\n1. $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial g_1} = 2(g_1 - d_1) + \\lambda_1 - \\lambda_2 - \\lambda_3 + \\lambda_4 = 2g_1 + \\lambda_1 - \\lambda_2 - \\lambda_3 + \\lambda_4 = 0$\n2. $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial g_2} = 2(g_2 - d_2) + \\lambda_3 - \\lambda_4 - \\lambda_5 + \\lambda_6 - \\lambda_7 = 2(g_2-50) + \\lambda_3 - \\lambda_4 - \\lambda_5 + \\lambda_6 - \\lambda_7 = 0$\n3. $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial g_3} = 2(g_3 - d_3) + \\lambda_5 - \\lambda_6 - \\lambda_8 = 2(g_3-10) + \\lambda_5 - \\lambda_6 - \\lambda_8 = 0$\n\nThe desired trajectory violates the ramp-up from $t=1$ to $t=2$ most severely ($d_2-d_1 = 50$, limit is $20$). It is highly probable that this constraint will be active at the optimum, i.e., $h_3 = 0$. Let us hypothesize that this is the only active constraint, meaning all other constraints are strictly satisfied ($h_i  0$ for $i \\neq 3$) and their corresponding multipliers are zero ($\\lambda_i = 0$ for $i \\neq 3$).\n\nUnder this hypothesis:\n- Active constraint: $g_2 - g_1 - 20 = 0 \\implies g_2 = g_1 + 20$.\n- Multipliers: $\\lambda_1 = \\lambda_2 = \\lambda_4 = \\lambda_5 = \\lambda_6 = \\lambda_7 = \\lambda_8 = 0$.\n\nThe stationarity conditions simplify to:\n1. $2g_1 - \\lambda_3 = 0$\n2. $2(g_2 - 50) + \\lambda_3 = 0$\n3. $2(g_3 - 10) = 0$\n\nFrom condition (3), we find $g_3 = 10$.\nFrom condition (1), $\\lambda_3 = 2g_1$.\nSubstitute this into condition (2): $2(g_2 - 50) + 2g_1 = 0 \\implies g_2 - 50 + g_1 = 0 \\implies g_1 + g_2 = 50$.\nNow we have a system of two linear equations for $g_1$ and $g_2$:\n- $g_2 = g_1 + 20$\n- $g_1 + g_2 = 50$\n\nSubstitute the first into the second:\n$g_1 + (g_1 + 20) = 50$\n$2g_1 = 30$\n$g_1^{\\star} = 15$\n\nThen, $g_2^{\\star} = g_1^{\\star} + 20 = 15 + 20 = 35$.\nSo, our candidate optimal trajectory is $\\mathbf{g}^{\\star} = [15, 35, 10]$.\n\nWe must verify this solution.\nFirst, check if all constraints are satisfied for $\\mathbf{g}^{\\star} = [15, 35, 10]$:\n- $0 \\leq g_1^{\\star} \\leq 20 \\implies 0 \\leq 15 \\leq 20$. (Satisfied, inactive)\n- $g_2^{\\star} - g_1^{\\star} \\leq 20 \\implies 35 - 15 = 20 \\leq 20$. (Satisfied, active as assumed)\n- $g_1^{\\star} - g_2^{\\star} \\leq 30 \\implies 15 - 35 = -20 \\leq 30$. (Satisfied, inactive)\n- $g_3^{\\star} - g_2^{\\star} \\leq 20 \\implies 10 - 35 = -25 \\leq 20$. (Satisfied, inactive)\n- $g_2^{\\star} - g_3^{\\star} \\leq 30 \\implies 35 - 10 = 25 \\leq 30$. (Satisfied, inactive)\n- $g_2^{\\star} \\geq 0 \\implies 35 \\geq 0$. (Satisfied, inactive)\n- $g_3^{\\star} \\geq 0 \\implies 10 \\geq 0$. (Satisfied, inactive)\nThe trajectory is feasible.\n\nSecond, check the KKT conditions. We need $\\lambda_3 \\geq 0$.\n$\\lambda_3 = 2g_1^{\\star} = 2(15) = 30$.\nSince $\\lambda_3 = 30 > 0$ and all other multipliers are $0$, the KKT conditions (primal feasibility, dual feasibility, and complementary slackness) are all satisfied. Thus, $\\mathbf{g}^{\\star} = [15, 35, 10]$ is the unique optimal solution.\n\n**Calculate the Minimal Objective Value**\nThe final step is to calculate the value of the objective function for the optimal trajectory $\\mathbf{g}^{\\star} = [15, 35, 10]$ and the desired trajectory $\\mathbf{d} = [0, 50, 10]$.\n\nMinimal penalty = $\\sum_{t=1}^{3} (g_t^{\\star} - d_t)^2$\n$= (g_1^{\\star} - d_1)^2 + (g_2^{\\star} - d_2)^2 + (g_3^{\\star} - d_3)^2$\n$= (15 - 0)^2 + (35 - 50)^2 + (10 - 10)^2$\n$= (15)^2 + (-15)^2 + (0)^2$\n$= 225 + 225 + 0$\n$= 450$\n\nThe minimal objective value is $450\\,\\mathrm{MW}^2$.",
