It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. Therefore, a solution will be formulated.\n\n**Solution Formulation**\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the thermal efficiency and the heat rate of a power island operating at steady state.\n\nFirst, we calculate the rate of fuel chemical energy input, $\\dot{E}_{chem}$, based on its lower heating value (LHV). This is given by the product of the fuel mass flow rate, $\\dot{m}_{f}$, and the LHV.\n\n$$\n\\dot{E}_{chem} = \\dot{m}_{f} \\times LHV\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\dot{E}_{chem} = (3.0\\,\\text{kg/s}) \\times (50\\,\\text{MJ/kg}) = 150\\,\\text{MJ/s}\n$$\n\nSince $1\\,\\text{J/s}$ is equivalent to $1\\,\\text{W}$, it follows that $1\\,\\text{MJ/s}$ is equivalent to $1\\,\\text{MW}$. Therefore, the fuel energy input rate is:\n$$\n\\dot{E}_{chem} = 150\\,\\text{MW}\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the LHV-based conversion efficiency, $\\eta$. This is defined as the ratio of the net electric power output, $P$, to the fuel chemical energy input rate, $\\dot{E}_{chem}$.\n\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{P}{\\dot{E}_{chem}}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given value for $P$ and the calculated value for $\\dot{E}_{chem}$:\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{100\\,\\text{MW}}{150\\,\\text{MW}} = \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires this to be expressed as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\eta \\approx 0.66666... \\approx 0.6667\n$$\n\nNow, we determine the heat rate, $HR$. The heat rate is the amount of fuel energy input required to produce one unit of electrical energy. It is the reciprocal of the efficiency, but care must be taken with units.\n\n$$\nHR = \\frac{\\text{Fuel Energy Input}}{\\text{Electrical Energy Output}}\n$$\n\nTo calculate the heat rate in units of $\\text{kJ/kWh}$, we use the conversion factor $1\\,\\text{kWh} = 3600\\,\\text{kJ}$. The heat rate is the fuel energy in $\\text{kJ}$ needed to produce $1\\,\\text{kWh}$ of electricity.\nThe energy equivalent of $1\\,\\text{kWh}$ is $3600\\,\\text{kJ}$. The fuel energy required to produce this amount of electrical energy is given by $\\frac{3600\\,\\text{kJ}}{\\eta}$.\n\n$$\nHR_{\\text{kJ/kWh}} = \\frac{3600\\,\\text{kJ}}{1\\,\\text{kWh}} \\times \\frac{1}{\\eta} = \\frac{3600}{\\eta}\\,\\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{kWh}}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the exact value of $\\eta = 2/3$:\n$$\nHR_{\\text{kJ/kWh}} = \\frac{3600}{2/3} = 3600 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 5400\\,\\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{kWh}}\n$$\nAs per the instruction to round to four significant figures, the value is $5400$. To represent this with four significant figures unambiguously, we can write it as $5.400 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{kJ/kWh}$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the heat rate in units of $\\text{Btu/kWh}$. We use the given conversion factor $1\\,\\text{kWh} = 3.412 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\text{Btu}$. The logic is identical to the previous calculation.\n\n$$\nHR_{\\text{Btu/kWh}} = \\frac{3.412 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\text{Btu}}{1\\,\\text{kWh}} \\times \\frac{1}{\\eta} = \\frac{3.412 \\times 10^{3}}{\\eta}\\,\\frac{\\text{Btu}}{\\text{kWh}}\n$$\n\nSubstituting $\\eta = 2/3$:\n$$\nHR_{\\text{Btu/kWh}} = \\frac{3.412 \\times 10^{3}}{2/3} = (3.412 \\times 10^{3}) \\times 1.5 = 5.118 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\frac{\\text{Btu}}{\\text{kWh}}\n$$\nThis result is already expressed with four significant figures.\n$$\nHR_{\\text{Btu/kWh}} = 5118\\,\\frac{\\text{Btu}}{\\text{kWh}}\n$$\n\nThe three requested quantities, rounded to four significant figures, are:\n$\\eta \\approx 0.6667$\n$HR = 5.400 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{kJ/kWh}$\n$HR = 5118\\,\\text{Btu/kWh}$",

The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary data and definitions to derive the required relationship and compute the final value. A unique solution exists.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, technical language devoid of subjectivity or bias.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid and self-contained. A rigorous solution can be constructed based on the provided information.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nLet $P_{elec}$ denote the electrical power output of the plant. Let $\\dot{m}_{fuel}$ be the mass flow rate of the natural gas fuel. The Lower Heating Value ($LHV$) and Higher Heating Value ($HHV$) are specific energies, typically given in units of energy per unit mass (e.g., $J/kg$).\n\nThe rate of fuel energy input, $\\dot{E}_{in}$, can be calculated on either an LHV or HHV basis.\nOn an LHV basis, the energy input rate is:\n$$ \\dot{E}_{in, LHV} = \\dot{m}_{fuel} \\times LHV $$\nOn an HHV basis, the energy input rate is:\n$$ \\dot{E}_{in, HHV} = \\dot{m}_{fuel} \\times HHV $$\n\nAccording to the definition provided in the problem statement, the efficiency, $\\eta$, is the ratio of the electrical power output to the fuel energy input rate.\n\nThe LHV-basis efficiency, $\\eta_{LHV}$, is therefore:\n$$ \\eta_{LHV} = \\frac{P_{elec}}{\\dot{E}_{in, LHV}} = \\frac{P_{elec}}{\\dot{m}_{fuel} \\times LHV} $$\n\nSimilarly, the HHV-basis efficiency, $\\eta_{HHV}$, is:\n$$ \\eta_{HHV} = \\frac{P_{elec}}{\\dot{E}_{in, HHV}} = \\frac{P_{elec}}{\\dot{m}_{fuel} \\times HHV} $$\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the relationship between $\\eta_{HHV}$ and $\\eta_{LHV}$. Since the plant is in a steady state, the electrical output $P_{elec}$ and the fuel mass flow rate $\\dot{m}_{fuel}$ are constant regardless of which heating value is used for the efficiency calculation. We can solve the first equation for $P_{elec}$:\n$$ P_{elec} = \\eta_{LHV} \\times \\dot{m}_{fuel} \\times LHV $$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $P_{elec}$ into the equation for $\\eta_{HHV}$:\n$$ \\eta_{HHV} = \\frac{(\\eta_{LHV} \\times \\dot{m}_{fuel} \\times LHV)}{(\\dot{m}_{fuel} \\times HHV)} $$\n\nThe fuel mass flow rate, $\\dot{m}_{fuel}$, being a common factor in the numerator and denominator, cancels out. This leaves the direct relationship between the two efficiencies:\n$$ \\eta_{HHV} = \\eta_{LHV} \\times \\left(\\frac{LHV}{HHV}\\right) $$\nThis equation is the derived relationship. It shows that the HHV efficiency is the LHV efficiency scaled by the ratio of the heating values. Since by definition $HHV  LHV$, the ratio $\\frac{LHV}{HHV}$ is less than $1$, and thus $\\eta_{HHV}$ will be numerically smaller than $\\eta_{LHV}$.\n\nNow, we can compute the numerical value of $\\eta_{HHV}$ using the given data:\n-   $\\eta_{LHV} = 0.465$\n-   $\\frac{LHV}{HHV} = 0.92$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived relationship:\n$$ \\eta_{HHV} = 0.465 \\times 0.92 $$\n\nPerforming the multiplication yields:\n$$ \\eta_{HHV} = 0.4278 $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated result, $0.4278$, already contains exactly four significant figures. Therefore, no further rounding is needed. The HHV-basis efficiency of the power plant is $0.4278$.",

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed to derive the solution from the provided definitions and first principles.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nFirst, we must formalize the definitions of $HR(P)$ and $IHR(P)$ based on the provided statements and their foundational meaning in physics and engineering.\n\n1.  **Average Heat Rate ($HR(P)$)**: Defined as \"the fuel heat input per unit electrical power at a given $P$\". This is an average quantity, representing the total input divided by the total output.\n    $$HR(P) = \\frac{\\dot{Q}_{\\text{fuel}}(P)}{P}$$\n    Note that this is the reciprocal of the thermal conversion efficiency: $HR(P) = 1/\\eta(P)$.\n\n2.  **Incremental Heat Rate ($IHR(P)$)**: Defined as \"the marginal fuel heat input per marginal electrical power increase at $P$\". The term \"marginal\" in this context unambiguously refers to the rate of change, which is mathematically expressed as a derivative.\n    $$IHR(P) = \\frac{d\\dot{Q}_{\\text{fuel}}(P)}{dP}$$\n\nNow, we can derive the relationship between these two quantities. We start with the expression that relates the total heat input $\\dot{Q}_{\\text{fuel}}(P)$ to the average heat rate $HR(P)$:\n$$\\dot{Q}_{\\text{fuel}}(P) = P \\cdot HR(P)$$\nTo find the $IHR(P)$, we differentiate this expression with respect to $P$. We must apply the product rule for differentiation, $(uv)' = u'v + uv'$:\n$$IHR(P) = \\frac{d}{dP} \\left( \\dot{Q}_{\\text{fuel}}(P) \\right) = \\frac{d}{dP} \\left( P \\cdot HR(P) \\right)$$\n$$IHR(P) = \\left( \\frac{dP}{dP} \\right) \\cdot HR(P) + P \\cdot \\frac{d(HR(P))}{dP}$$\n$$IHR(P) = 1 \\cdot HR(P) + P \\, \\frac{d(HR(P))}{dP}$$\nThus, the exact mathematical relationship is:\n$$IHR(P) = HR(P) + P \\, \\frac{d(HR(P))}{dP}$$\n\nNext, we analyze the condition $IHR(P)  HR(P)$. Using the derived relationship:\n$$HR(P) + P \\, \\frac{d(HR(P))}{dP}  HR(P)$$\nSubtracting $HR(P)$ from both sides gives:\n$$P \\, \\frac{d(HR(P))}{dP}  0$$\nThe problem is defined for $P \\in (0, P_{\\max}]$, so the power $P$ is strictly positive. We can divide by $P$ without changing the inequality's direction:\n$$\\frac{d(HR(P))}{dP}  0$$\nThis means that $IHR(P)$ is greater than $HR(P)$ precisely when the average heat rate $HR(P)$ is an increasing function of power output $P$.\n\nLet's relate this condition to the efficiency, $\\eta(P)$. Since $HR(P) = 1/\\eta(P)$, we can find its derivative with respect to $P$ using the chain rule:\n$$\\frac{d(HR(P))}{dP} = \\frac{d}{dP} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\eta(P)} \\right) = -\\frac{1}{(\\eta(P))^2} \\frac{d\\eta(P)}{dP}$$\nSubstituting this into our inequality $\\frac{d(HR(P))}{dP}  0$:\n$$-\\frac{1}{(\\eta(P))^2} \\frac{d\\eta(P)}{dP}  0$$\nSince efficiency $\\eta(P)$ is positive, $(\\eta(P))^2$ is also positive. We can multiply by $-(\\eta(P))^2$, which reverses the inequality sign:\n$$\\frac{d\\eta(P)}{dP}  0$$\nTherefore, the condition $IHR(P)  HR(P)$ is equivalent to the condition that the generator's thermal efficiency is a decreasing function of its power output.\n\nThis typically occurs at higher power levels. For a typical thermal generator with no-load heat consumption ($\\dot{Q}_0  0$), the efficiency initially increases with load as the fixed losses are spread over a larger power output. The heat rate curve $HR(P) = \\dot{Q}_{\\text{fuel}}(P)/P$ is often U-shaped or at least initially decreasing. The minimum of the $HR(P)$ curve corresponds to the point of maximum efficiency. At this point, $\\frac{d(HR(P))}{dP} = 0$, which implies $IHR(P) = HR(P)$. For power levels beyond this point of maximum efficiency, $HR(P)$ begins to increase ($\\frac{d(HR(P))}{dP}  0$), and consequently, $IHR(P)  HR(P)$. The claim that this happens when $\\dot{Q}_{\\text{fuel}}(P)$ is strictly convex (i.e., $\\frac{d^2\\dot{Q}_{\\text{fuel}}(P)}{dP^2}  0$) and $P$ is \"sufficiently large\" is a correct physical characterization of this regime.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $IHR(P) = HR(P) + P \\, \\dfrac{d\\,HR(P)}{dP}$, and $IHR(P) > HR(P)$ whenever $\\dfrac{d\\,HR(P)}{dP} > 0$, which occurs at operating points where efficiency declines with load (i.e., $\\dfrac{d\\,\\eta(P)}{dP}  0$) or, equivalently, when $\\dot{Q}_{\\text{fuel}}(P)$ is strictly convex and $P$ is sufficiently large relative to $\\dot{Q}_0$.**\n\n-   The mathematical expression $IHR(P) = HR(P) + P \\, \\dfrac{d\\,HR(P)}{dP}$ is identical to the one derived from first principles. This is correct.\n-   The condition for $IHR(P) > HR(P)$ is correctly identified as $\\dfrac{d\\,HR(P)}{dP} > 0$.\n-   The equivalence of this condition to declining efficiency, $\\dfrac{d\\,\\eta(P)}{dP}  0$, is also correct as demonstrated in the derivation.\n-   The final characterization of the operating regime is a physically correct description of when this condition is met for a typical thermal generator.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $IHR(P) = \\dfrac{d\\,HR(P)}{dP}$, and $IHR(P) > HR(P)$ whenever $\\dot{Q}_0 > 0$ regardless of $P$.**\n\n-   The mathematical expression $IHR(P) = \\dfrac{d\\,HR(P)}{dP}$ is incorrect. $IHR(P)$ is the derivative of the total fuel consumption $\\dot{Q}_{\\text{fuel}}(P)$, not the average heat rate $HR(P)$.\n-   The condition for $IHR(P) > HR(P)$ is incorrect. For a typical unit with $\\dot{Q}_0 > 0$, efficiency often improves at low loads, meaning $\\dfrac{d\\eta(P)}{dP} > 0$, which implies $IHR(P)  HR(P)$. The condition is not independent of $P$.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. $IHR(P) = HR(P)$ for all $P$ because both measure fuel per unit power, so any $IHR(P) \\ne HR(P)$ indicates metering error rather than physics.**\n\n-   This statement fundamentally misunderstands the distinction between an average quantity ($HR$) and a marginal quantity ($IHR$). They are not the same in general. The equality $IHR(P) = HR(P)$ only holds under the specific condition that $\\frac{d(HR(P))}{dP} = 0$ (e.g., at the point of minimum average heat rate) or if the fuel curve is a line through the origin ($\\dot{Q}_{\\text{fuel}}(P)=kP$), which is not the general case. The difference is a real physical property of the generator's performance curve.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. $IHR(P) = HR(P) - P \\, \\dfrac{d\\,HR(P)}{dP}$, and $IHR(P) > HR(P)$ whenever $\\dfrac{d\\,HR(P)}{dP}  0$, i.e., when efficiency improves with load.**\n\n-   The mathematical expression $IHR(P) = HR(P) - P \\, \\dfrac{d\\,HR(P)}{dP}$ has the wrong sign. The derivation unambiguously shows a plus sign.\n-   This incorrect formula leads to the incorrect conclusion that $IHR(P) > HR(P)$ when $\\dfrac{d\\,HR(P)}{dP}  0$. This condition corresponds to the region where efficiency *improves* with load, which is the opposite of the correct physical behavior.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
