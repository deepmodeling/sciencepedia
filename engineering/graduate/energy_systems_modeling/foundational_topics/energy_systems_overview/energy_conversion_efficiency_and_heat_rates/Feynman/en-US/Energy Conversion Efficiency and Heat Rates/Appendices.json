It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. Therefore, a solution will be formulated.\n\n**Solution Formulation**\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the thermal efficiency and the heat rate of a power island operating at steady state.\n\nFirst, we calculate the rate of fuel chemical energy input, $\\dot{E}_{chem}$, based on its lower heating value (LHV). This is given by the product of the fuel mass flow rate, $\\dot{m}_{f}$, and the LHV.\n\n$$\n\\dot{E}_{chem} = \\dot{m}_{f} \\times LHV\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\dot{E}_{chem} = (3.0\\,\\mathrm{kg/s}) \\times (50\\,\\mathrm{MJ/kg}) = 150\\,\\mathrm{MJ/s}\n$$\n\nSince $1\\,\\mathrm{J/s}$ is equivalent to $1\\,\\mathrm{W}$, it follows that $1\\,\\mathrm{MJ/s}$ is equivalent to $1\\,\\mathrm{MW}$. Therefore, the fuel energy input rate is:\n$$\n\\dot{E}_{chem} = 150\\,\\mathrm{MW}\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the LHV-based conversion efficiency, $\\eta$. This is defined as the ratio of the net electric power output, $P$, to the fuel chemical energy input rate, $\\dot{E}_{chem}$.\n\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{P}{\\dot{E}_{chem}}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given value for $P$ and the calculated value for $\\dot{E}_{chem}$:\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{100\\,\\mathrm{MW}}{150\\,\\mathrm{MW}} = \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires this to be expressed as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\eta \\approx 0.66666... \\approx 0.6667\n$$\n\nNow, we determine the heat rate, $HR$. The heat rate is the amount of fuel energy input required to produce one unit of electrical energy. It is the reciprocal of the efficiency, but care must be taken with units.\n\n$$\nHR = \\frac{\\text{Fuel Energy Input}}{\\text{Electrical Energy Output}}\n$$\n\nTo calculate the heat rate in units of $\\mathrm{kJ/kWh}$, we use the conversion factor $1\\,\\mathrm{kWh} = 3600\\,\\mathrm{kJ}$. The heat rate is the fuel energy in $\\mathrm{kJ}$ needed to produce $1\\,\\mathrm{kWh}$ of electricity.\nThe energy equivalent of $1\\,\\mathrm{kWh}$ is $3600\\,\\mathrm{kJ}$. The fuel energy required to produce this amount of electrical energy is given by $\\frac{3600\\,\\mathrm{kJ}}{\\eta}$.\n\n$$\nHR_{\\mathrm{kJ/kWh}} = \\frac{3600\\,\\mathrm{kJ}}{1\\,\\mathrm{kWh}} \\times \\frac{1}{\\eta} = \\frac{3600}{\\eta}\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{kJ}}{\\mathrm{kWh}}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the exact value of $\\eta = 2/3$:\n$$\nHR_{\\mathrm{kJ/kWh}} = \\frac{3600}{2/3} = 3600 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 5400\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{kJ}}{\\mathrm{kWh}}\n$$\nAs per the instruction to round to four significant figures, the value is $5400$. To represent this with four significant figures unambiguously, we can write it as $5.400 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{kJ/kWh}$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the heat rate in units of $\\mathrm{Btu/kWh}$. We use the given conversion factor $1\\,\\mathrm{kWh} = 3.412 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{Btu}$. The logic is identical to the previous calculation.\n\n$$\nHR_{\\mathrm{Btu/kWh}} = \\frac{3.412 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{Btu}}{1\\,\\mathrm{kWh}} \\times \\frac{1}{\\eta} = \\frac{3.412 \\times 10^{3}}{\\eta}\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{Btu}}{\\mathrm{kWh}}\n$$\n\nSubstituting $\\eta = 2/3$:\n$$\nHR_{\\mathrm{Btu/kWh}} = \\frac{3.412 \\times 10^{3}}{2/3} = (3.412 \\times 10^{3}) \\times 1.5 = 5.118 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{Btu}}{\\mathrm{kWh}}\n$$\nThis result is already expressed with four significant figures.\n$$\nHR_{\\mathrm{Btu/kWh}} = 5118\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{Btu}}{\\mathrm{kWh}}\n$$\n\nThe three requested quantities, rounded to four significant figures, are:\n$\\eta \\approx 0.6667$\n$HR = 5.400 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{kJ/kWh}$\n$HR = 5118\\,\\mathrm{Btu/kWh}$",

All necessary data are provided, and the objective is clear. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the definitions of thermal efficiency and heat rate for a power plant. The First Law of Thermodynamics for a control volume at steady state, neglecting kinetic and potential energy changes, states that the net rate of work output, $\\dot{W}$, is equal to the rate of heat supplied to the working fluid minus the rate of heat rejected. For a fuel-burning power plant, the energy input is the chemical energy released during combustion, quantified by the fuel's heating value.\n\nThe thermal efficiency, $\\eta_{th}$, is the ratio of the net power output, $P$, to the rate of heat energy input from the fuel, $\\dot{Q}_{in}$.\n$$\n\\eta_{th} = \\frac{P}{\\dot{Q}_{in}}\n$$\nThe rate of heat input, $\\dot{Q}_{in}$, is determined by the mass flow rate of the fuel, $\\dot{m}_f$, and its heating value.

All necessary data are provided, and the tasks are clearly defined, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution.\n\nThe solution is developed by systematically addressing the three tasks for each test case, based on the provided fundamental principles.\n\n### Task 1: Exergy Destruction Apportionment\n\nThe first task is to calculate the fractional contribution of each of the five specified components to the total exergy destruction rate of the plant. The analysis is based on the Gouy-Stodola theorem, which relates the rate of exergy destruction, $\\dot{E}_{d,i}$, in a component $i$ to its rate of entropy generation, $\\dot{S}_{\\text{gen},i}$, and the ambient absolute temperature, $T_0$.\n\nThe theorem is given as:\n$$\n\\dot{E}_{d,i} = T_0 \\dot{S}_{\\text{gen},i}\n$$\n\nThe problem provides $T_0$ in $\\mathrm{K}$ and $\\dot{S}_{\\text{gen},i}$ in $\\mathrm{kW}/\\mathrm{K}$. Their product yields the exergy destruction rate $\\dot{E}_{d,i}$ in units of $\\mathrm{kW}$. To express this in megawatts ($\\mathrm{MW}$), as required, we divide by $1000$:\n$$\n\\dot{E}_{d,i} [\\mathrm{MW}] = \\frac{T_0 [\\mathrm{K}] \\cdot \\dot{S}_{\\text{gen},i} [\\mathrm{kW}/\\mathrm{K}]}{1000}\n$$\n\nAfter calculating $\\dot{E}_{d,i}$ for each of the five components ($i \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$), the total exergy destruction rate for the plant, $\\dot{E}_{d,\\text{total}}$, is found by summing the individual contributions:\n$$\n\\dot{E}_{d,\\text{total}} = \\sum_{i=0}^{4} \\dot{E}_{d,i}\n$$\n\nFinally, the apportionment fraction, $f_i$, for each component is the ratio of its exergy destruction rate to the total:\n$$\nf_i = \\frac{\\dot{E}_{d,i}}{\\dot{E}_{d,\\text{total}}}\n$$\nThese fractions are reported as decimals.\n\n### Task 2: Heat Rate Reduction Calculation\n\nThe second task is to derive and compute the reduction in the plant's heat rate, $\\Delta \\text{HR}_i$, that would result from a hypothetical recovery of a small amount of exergy, $\\Delta E_x = 1 \\mathrm{MW}$, at each component $i$. This calculation is performed under the constraint that the net power output of the plant, $W_{\\text{net}}$, remains constant.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from first principles as follows:\n1.  A recovery of exergy $\\Delta E_x$ at component $i$ can be converted into additional net electrical power, $\\Delta W_{\\text{net},i}$, with a path-specific recovery factor, $r_i$.\n    $$\n    \\Delta W_{\\text{net},i} = r_i \\Delta E_x\n    $$\n2.  The problem constrains $W_{\\text{net}}$ to be constant. This means the additional power gained from exergy recovery must be offset by an equal reduction in the power generated from the fuel.\n3.  The power generated from the fuel is related to the fuel energy rate, $F$, by the plant's overall thermal efficiency, $\\eta_{\\text{th}} = W_{\\text{net}} / F$. Thus, a small reduction in fuel rate, $\\Delta F$, leads to a reduction in power output of $\\eta_{\\text{th}} \\Delta F$, assuming $\\eta_{\\text{th}}$ is approximately constant for this small change.\n4.  To maintain a constant $W_{\\text{net}}$, we must have:\n    $$\n    \\eta_{\\text{th}} \\Delta F = \\Delta W_{\\text{net},i} = r_i \\Delta E_x\n    $$\n5.  This allows us to determine the necessary reduction in fuel energy rate:\n    $$\n    \\Delta F = \\frac{r_i \\Delta E_x}{\\eta_{\\text{th}}}\n    $$\n6.  The plant heat rate, $\\text{HR}$, is defined as $\\text{HR} = \\frac{F \\cdot 3600}{W_{\\text{net}}}$, with $F$ in $\\mathrm{MJ}/\\mathrm{s}$ ($\\mathrm{MW}$) and $W_{\\text{net}}$ in $\\mathrm{MW}$. The resulting units are $\\mathrm{MJ}/\\mathrm{MWh}$.\n7.  The change in heat rate, $\\Delta(\\text{HR})$, due to the fuel reduction $\\Delta F$ is:\n    $$\n    \\Delta(\\text{HR}) = \\text{HR}_{\\text{final}} - \\text{HR}_{\\text{initial}} = \\frac{(F - \\Delta F) \\cdot 3600}{W_{\\text{net}}} - \\frac{F \\cdot 3600}{W_{\\text{net}}} = -\\frac{\\Delta F \\cdot 3600}{W_{\\text{net}}}\n    $$\n8.  The problem asks for the *reduction* in heat rate, which is a positive quantity, $\\Delta \\text{HR}_i = -\\Delta(\\text{HR})$. Substituting the expression for $\\Delta F$:\n    $$\n    \\Delta \\text{HR}_i = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{r_i \\Delta E_x}{\\eta_{\\text{th}}}\\right) \\cdot 3600}{W_{\\text{net}}} = \\frac{3600 \\cdot r_i \\cdot \\Delta E_x}{\\eta_{\\text{th}} \\cdot W_{\\text{net}}}\n    $$\n9.  Given that $\\Delta E_x = 1 \\mathrm{MW}$, the final formula for the calculation is:\n    $$\n    \\Delta \\text{HR}_i = \\frac{3600 \\cdot r_i}{\\eta_{\\text{th}} \\cdot W_{\\text{net}}}\n    $$\n    The recovery factors $r_i$ are determined for each component based on the provided physical justifications:\n    -   $r_0$ (GT Combustor): $r_0 = \\eta^{(2)}_{\\text{GT path}} \\cdot \\eta_{\\text{gen,GT}}$\n    -   $r_1$ (GT Turbine): $r_1 = \\eta_{\\text{gen,GT}}$\n    -   $r_2$ (HRSG): $r_2 = \\eta^{(2)}_{\\text{ST path}} \\cdot \\eta_{\\text{gen,ST}}$\n    -   $r_3$ (ST Turbine): $r_3 = \\eta_{\\text{gen,ST}}$\n    -   $r_4$ (Condenser): $r_4 = \\phi_{\\text{cond}} \\cdot \\eta_{\\text{gen,ST}}$\n\n### Task 3: Identification of the Best Component for Improvement\n\nThe third task is to identify which single component offers the largest potential for plant performance improvement. In this context, \"best\" is defined as yielding the largest reduction in heat rate, $\\Delta \\text{HR}_i$, for a $1 \\mathrm{MW}$ recovery of exergy. This is found by computing the five $\\Delta \\text{HR}_i$ values and identifying the maximum among them. The result is reported as the integer index ($0$ to $4$) of that component. If a tie occurs, the smaller index is chosen.\n\nThese three tasks are executed for each test case, and the results are aggregated as per the specified output format.",
