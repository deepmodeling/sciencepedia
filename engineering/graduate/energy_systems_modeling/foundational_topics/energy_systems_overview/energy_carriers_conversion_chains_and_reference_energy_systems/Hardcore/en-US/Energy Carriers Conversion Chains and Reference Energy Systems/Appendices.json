This practice challenges you to apply the concept of exergy to a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system, demonstrating why it provides a more physically meaningful basis for allocating fuel and emissions than a simple energy balance. Mastering this distinction is critical for fair and accurate environmental accounting in complex, multi-product energy systems. ",

            "problem": "A Combined Heat and Power (CHP) unit is represented within a Reference Energy System (RES) conversion chain as a single node that accepts a chemical fuel and produces two energy carriers: electricity and district heat. The CHP consumes a steady fuel input with lower heating value energy rate $\\dot{E}_{\\text{fuel}} = 200~\\text{MW}$ and produces electricity at rate $\\dot{W}_{e} = 80~\\text{MW}$ and district heat at rate $\\dot{Q}_{\\text{dh}} = 100~\\text{MW}$.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of thermodynamics and energy systems analysis, is well-posed with all necessary data provided, and is stated objectively.\n\nThe solution proceeds in four stages:\n1.  Derivation of the exergy rate of the delivered district heat, $\\dot{B}_{\\text{dh}}$.\n2.  Calculation of the energy-based allocation fraction, $f_{E}$.\n3.  Calculation of the exergy-based allocation fraction, $f_{X}$.\n4.  Calculation of the ratio $R = f_{X} / f_{E}$ and discussion of the implications for emissions accounting.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Exergy of District Heat**\n\nThe exergy, or available work, of a quantity of heat $\\delta Q$ transferred at a temperature $T$ relative to a reference (dead state) environment at temperature $T_0$ is given by the Second Law of Thermodynamics as:\n$$dB = \\delta Q \\left( 1 - \\frac{T_0}{T} \\right)$$\nThis represents the maximum work that could be produced by a Carnot engine operating between temperatures $T$ and $T_0$ with heat input $\\delta Q$.\n\nIn the case of district heating, heat is not supplied at a single temperature but over a range, as a fluid is heated from a return temperature $T_r$ to a supply temperature $T_s$. The heat is delivered as sensible heat, so the rate of heat transfer $d\\dot{Q}$ corresponding to an infinitesimal temperature increase $dT$ is:\n$$d\\dot{Q} = \\dot{m} c_p dT$$\nwhere $\\dot{m}$ is the mass flow rate of the heat transfer fluid and $c_p$ is its specific heat capacity at constant pressure. For the purpose of this derivation, the product $\\dot{C} = \\dot{m} c_p$ represents the heat capacity rate of the fluid stream.\n\nThe differential rate of exergy transfer $d\\dot{B}_{\\text{dh}}$ associated with the heat transfer rate $d\\dot{Q}$ at temperature $T$ is:\n$$d\\dot{B}_{\\text{dh}} = \\left( 1 - \\frac{T_0}{T} \\right) d\\dot{Q} = \\left( 1 - \\frac{T_0}{T} \\right) \\dot{C} dT$$\nTo find the total exergy rate of the district heat, $\\dot{B}_{\\text{dh}}$, we must integrate this expression over the temperature range from $T_r$ to $T_s$:\n$$\\dot{B}_{\\text{dh}} = \\int_{T_r}^{T_s} \\left( 1 - \\frac{T_0}{T} \\right) \\dot{C} dT$$\nAssuming $\\dot{C}$ is constant, we can perform the integration:\n$$\\dot{B}_{\\text{dh}} = \\dot{C} \\int_{T_r}^{T_s} \\left( 1 - \\frac{T_0}{T} \\right) dT = \\dot{C} \\left[ T - T_0 \\ln(T) \\right]_{T_r}^{T_s}$$\n$$\\dot{B}_{\\text{dh}} = \\dot{C} \\left( (T_s - T_r) - T_0 (\\ln(T_s) - \\ln(T_r)) \\right)$$\n$$\\dot{B}_{\\text{dh}} = \\dot{C}(T_s - T_r) - \\dot{C} T_0 \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_s}{T_r}\\right)$$\nThe total rate of heat transfer is given by $\\dot{Q}_{\\text{dh}} = \\dot{C}(T_s - T_r)$. We can substitute $\\dot{C} = \\frac{\\dot{Q}_{\\text{dh}}}{T_s - T_r}$ into the expression for $\\dot{B}_{\\text{dh}}$ to eliminate the unknown heat capacity rate:\n$$\\dot{B}_{\\text{dh}} = \\dot{Q}_{\\text{dh}} - \\left(\\frac{\\dot{Q}_{\\text{dh}}}{T_s - T_r}\\right) T_0 \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_s}{T_r}\\right)$$\nFactoring out $\\dot{Q}_{\\text{dh}}$, we arrive at the desired expression for the exergy content of the district heat as a function of the given parameters:\n$$\\dot{B}_{\\text{dh}} = \\dot{Q}_{\\text{dh}} \\left( 1 - \\frac{T_0}{T_s - T_r} \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_s}{T_r}\\right) \\right)$$\nThis expression correctly captures that the exergy of heat transferred over a temperature range is lower than if the same amount of heat were transferred at the maximum temperature $T_s$.\n\n**2. Energy-Based Allocation**\n\nIn an energy-based allocation, the input fuel is partitioned in proportion to the energy rates of the outputs. The total energy output rate from the CHP is the sum of the electricity and district heat rates:\n$$\\dot{E}_{\\text{out, total}} = \\dot{W}_e + \\dot{Q}_{\\text{dh}}$$\nThe fraction of the fuel input allocated to electricity, $f_E$, is the ratio of the electricity output rate to the total energy output rate:\n$$f_E = \\frac{\\dot{W}_e}{\\dot{W}_e + \\dot{Q}_{\\text{dh}}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$\\dot{W}_e = 80~\\text{MW}$\n$\\dot{Q}_{\\text{dh}} = 100~\\text{MW}$\n$$f_E = \\frac{80}{80 + 100} = \\frac{80}{180} = \\frac{4}{9}$$\n\n**3. Exergy-Based Allocation**\n\nIn an exergy-based allocation, the input fuel is partitioned in proportion to the exergy rates of the outputs.\nThe exergy of work is equal to the work itself. Therefore, the exergy rate of the electricity is:\n$$\\dot{B}_e = \\dot{W}_e = 80~\\text{MW}$$\nThe exergy rate of the district heat, $\\dot{B}_{\\text{dh}}$, is calculated using the formula derived in Part 1 and the given temperatures:\n$T_s = 363~\\text{K}$\n$T_r = 323~\\text{K}$\n$T_0 = 293~\\text{K}$\n$$T_s - T_r = 363~\\text{K} - 323~\\text{K} = 40~\\text{K}$$\n$$\\dot{B}_{\\text{dh}} = 100~\\text{MW} \\times \\left( 1 - \\frac{293~\\text{K}}{40~\\text{K}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{363}{323}\\right) \\right)$$\n$$\\dot{B}_{\\text{dh}} \\approx 100 \\times \\left( 1 - 7.325 \\times \\ln(1.123839) \\right)$$\n$$\\dot{B}_{\\text{dh}} \\approx 100 \\times \\left( 1 - 7.325 \\times 0.116750 \\right)$$\n$$\\dot{B}_{\\text{dh}} \\approx 100 \\times (1 - 0.855269) \\approx 100 \\times 0.144731 = 14.4731~\\text{MW}$$\nThe total exergy output rate is:\n$$\\dot{B}_{\\text{out, total}} = \\dot{B}_e + \\dot{B}_{\\text{dh}} = 80~\\text{MW} + 14.4731~\\text{MW} = 94.4731~\\text{MW}$$\nThe fraction of the fuel input allocated to electricity, $f_X$, is the ratio of the electricity exergy rate to the total exergy output rate:\n$$f_X = \\frac{\\dot{B}_e}{\\dot{B}_e + \\dot{B}_{\\text{dh}}}$$\n$$f_X = \\frac{80}{94.4731} \\approx 0.84680$$\n\n**4. Calculation of Ratio R and Discussion**\n\nThe dimensionless ratio $R$ is defined as $R \\equiv f_{X} / f_{E}$. Using the calculated fractions:\n$$R = \\frac{f_X}{f_E} = \\frac{80 / 94.4731}{4 / 9} = \\frac{80}{94.4731} \\times \\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{180}{94.4731} \\approx 1.90530$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $R = 1.905$.\n\nThe significant difference between $f_E \\approx 0.444$ and $f_X \\approx 0.847$, as highlighted by $R \\approx 1.9$, is crucial for emissions accounting in a Reference Energy System (RES) framework.\nEmissions, such as $CO_2$, are directly proportional to the fuel consumed. For multi-output processes like CHP, these emissions must be allocated to the products (electricity and heat).\nAn **energy-based allocation** ($f_E$) treats $1~\\text{J}$ of electricity as equivalent to $1~\\text{J}$ of heat. This ignores the fundamental thermodynamic difference in energy *quality*. Electricity is high-quality energy (pure exergy), capable of performing any task, whereas low-temperature heat is low-quality energy, limited in its utility by the Second Law of Thermodynamics. By allocating only $44.4\\%$ of the fuel and emissions to electricity, this method undervalues the thermodynamic resources required to produce electricity and overstates the resources needed for heat.\nAn **exergy-based allocation** ($f_X$) rectifies this by weighting outputs by their thermodynamic quality, or their capacity to do work. As the calculation shows, the $100~\\text{MW}$ of heat has an exergy content of only about $14.5~\\text{MW}$. Electricity, being pure work, has an exergy content of $80~\\text{MW}$. Consequently, exergy-based allocation assigns $84.7\\%$ of the fuel and emissions to electricity. This reflects the physical reality that producing high-quality energy is far more resource-intensive than producing low-quality heat.\nIn an RES model used for policy analysis or emissions trading, the choice of allocation method has major consequences. Using an energy basis makes CHP electricity appear artificially low-carbon, while making the district heat appear carbon-intensive. Using an exergy basis provides a more physically consistent and equitable assignment of environmental burdens, correctly attributing a larger share of the emissions to the more valuable and versatile energy carrier, electricity.",

The costs consist of the initial investment, annual fixed and variable O&M costs, and costs for imported energy carriers (gas and electricity).\n\nThe discount factors for each period are:\n$\\delta_1 = (1+r)^{-(1-1)} = (1+0.1)^0 = 1$\n$\\delta_2 = (1+r)^{-(2-1)} = (1+0.1)^{-1} = \\frac{1}{1.1}$\n\nThe objective function to minimize, $Z$, is the sum of the investment cost and the discounted sum of annual operating costs:\n$$\n\\text{Minimize } Z = C_{\\text{inv}}K + \\sum_{t=1}^{2} \\delta_t \\left( c_{\\text{fix}}K + c_{\\text{var}}x_t + c_g g_t + c_e e_t \\right)\n$$\nThis can be expanded as:\n$$\n\\text{Minimize } Z = C_{\\text{inv}}K + \\delta_1(c_{\\text{fix}}K + c_{\\text{var}}x_1 + c_g g_1 + c_e e_1) + \\delta_2(c_{\\text{fix}}K + c_{\\text{var}}x_2 + c_g g_2 + c_e e_2)\n$$\n\nThe optimization is subject to a set of linear constraints that model the physical and operational rules of the energy system.\n\n1.  **Electricity Balance**: For each period $t$, the total electricity supplied (from generation $x_t$ and imports $e_t$) must be greater than or equal to the demand $D_t$.\n    $$\n    x_t + e_t \\geq D_t \\quad \\text{for } t \\in \\{1, 2\\}\n    $$\n    Since electricity import has a positive cost, at the optimum, this inequality will be satisfied with equality.\n\n2.  **Gas Turbine Conversion**: For each period $t$, the electricity output $x_t$ is related to the natural gas input $g_t$ by the conversion efficiency $\\eta$.\n    $$\n    x_t = \\eta g_t \\quad \\text{for } t \\in \\{1, 2\\}\n    $$\n\n3.  **Annual Capacity Limit**: For each period $t$, the electricity generated $x_t$ cannot exceed the maximum possible output from the installed capacity $K$. The maximum output is the product of the capacity $K$, the number of hours in a year $H$, and the capacity factor $\\text{CF}$.\n    $$\n    x_t \\leq H \\cdot \\text{CF} \\cdot K \\quad \\text{for } t \\in \\{1, 2\\}\n    $$\n\n4.  **Non-negativity**: All decision variables must be non-negative.\n    $$\n    K \\geq 0, \\quad x_t \\geq 0, \\quad e_t \\geq 0, \\quad g_t \\geq 0 \\quad \\text{for } t \\in \\{1, 2\\}\n    $$\n\n**Part 2: Solving for the Minimized Total Cost**\n\nTo solve the problem, we first analyze the economics of generation versus importation. The marginal cost of generating $1$ MWh of electricity from the gas turbine is the sum of the variable O&M cost and the fuel cost. The fuel cost per MWh of electricity is the gas price $c_g$ divided by the efficiency $\\eta$.\n$$\n\\text{Marginal cost of generation} = c_{\\text{var}} + \\frac{c_g}{\\eta} = 5 \\frac{\\text{USD}}{\\text{MWh}} + \\frac{20 \\text{ USD/MWh}}{0.5} = 5 + 40 = 45 \\frac{\\text{USD}}{\\text{MWh}}\n$$\nThe cost of importing electricity is $c_e = 80$ USD/MWh.\nSince the marginal cost of generation ($45$ USD/MWh) is less than the cost of importing ($80$ USD/MWh), it is always preferable to generate electricity rather than import it, provided the necessary generation capacity is available. The saving is $\\Delta c = c_e - (c_{\\text{var}} + c_g/\\eta) = 80 - 45 = 35$ USD/MWh for every MWh generated locally instead of being imported.\n\nThe decision to build capacity $K$ depends on whether the total discounted savings from generation outweigh the total discounted costs of building and maintaining that capacity.\n\nThe total discounted cost of building $1$ MW of capacity is the sum of the upfront investment and the discounted fixed O&M costs over the two periods.\n$$\n\\text{Cost per MW} = C_{\\text{inv}} + \\sum_{t=1}^{2} \\delta_t c_{\\text{fix}} = 500000 + (1 \\cdot 15000) + (\\frac{1}{1.1} \\cdot 15000)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Cost per MW} = 500000 + 15000 + 13636.36... = 528636.36... \\frac{\\text{USD}}{\\text{MW}}\n$$\n\nThe maximum annual energy that can be generated by $1$ MW of capacity is $L = H \\cdot \\text{CF} = 8760 \\cdot 0.8 = 7008$ MWh/MW.\nThe total discounted savings generated by $1$ MW of capacity, assuming it is fully utilized to displace imports, is the sum of discounted annual savings.\n$$\n\\text{Savings per MW} = \\sum_{t=1}^{2} \\delta_t \\cdot (L \\cdot \\Delta c) = L \\cdot \\Delta c \\sum_{t=1}^{2} \\delta_t\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Savings per MW} = (7008 \\cdot 35) \\cdot (1 + \\frac{1}{1.1}) = 245280 \\cdot (1.90909...) = 468409.09... \\frac{\\text{USD}}{\\text{MW}}\n$$\n\nComparing the cost and savings per MW of capacity:\n$$\n\\text{Cost per MW} = 528636.36... \\quad > \\quad \\text{Savings per MW} = 468409.09...\n$$\nThe total discounted cost of building and maintaining the gas turbine capacity is greater than the total discounted savings it would provide by displacing more expensive electricity imports. This analysis indicates that it is not economically viable to build any capacity. This holds true even if the plant is not fully utilized, as lower utilization would only decrease the savings, making the investment even less attractive.\n\nTherefore, the optimal capacity is $K=0$.\n\nWith $K=0$, no electricity can be generated ($x_1=0$, $x_2=0$), and no gas is consumed ($g_1=0$, $g_2=0$). All electricity demand must be met by imports.\n$$\ne_1 = D_1 = 3000 \\text{ MWh}\n$$\n$$\ne_2 = D_2 = 4000 \\text{ MWh}\n$$\n\nThe total minimized discounted cost (NPV) is the sum of the discounted costs of these electricity imports.\n$$\nZ_{\\text{min}} = \\delta_1 c_e e_1 + \\delta_2 c_e e_2\n$$\n$$\nZ_{\\text{min}} = (1) \\cdot (80 \\frac{\\text{USD}}{\\text{MWh}}) \\cdot (3000 \\text{ MWh}) + (\\frac{1}{1.1}) \\cdot (80 \\frac{\\text{USD}}{\\text{MWh}}) \\cdot (4000 \\text{ MWh})\n$$\n$$\nZ_{\\text{min}} = 240000 \\text{ USD} + \\frac{320000}{1.1} \\text{ USD}\n$$\n$$\nZ_{\\text{min}} = 240000 + 290909.0909... \\text{ USD}\n$$\n$$\nZ_{\\text{min}} = 530909.0909... \\text{ USD}\n$$\n\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures gives $530900$ USD.",
