The thermal efficiency of the real cycle is $\\eta_{\\mathrm{real}} = 1 - Q_{C,\\mathrm{real}}/Q_{H,\\mathrm{real}} = 1 - 750/1000 = 0.25$.

We proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation of Maximum Work Output ($W_{\\max}$)**\n\nThe First Law of Thermodynamics for a system undergoing a cycle states that the net work done by the system, $W$, is equal to the net heat transfer into the system, $Q_{\\mathrm{net}}$.\n$$W = Q_{\\mathrm{net}}$$\nFor a heat engine operating between two thermal reservoirs, one hot and one cold, the net heat transfer is the difference between the heat absorbed from the hot reservoir, $Q_{H}$, and the heat rejected to the cold reservoir, $Q_{C}$. We define both $Q_{H}$ and $Q_{C}$ as positive quantities.\n$$W = Q_{H} - Q_{C}$$\nThis equation is a direct consequence of the First Law (conservation of energy) applied to a cyclic process.\n\nThe Second Law of Thermodynamics, expressed by the Clausius inequality, provides a constraint on any thermodynamic cycle:\n$$\\oint \\frac{\\delta Q}{T} \\le 0$$\nwhere the equality holds for a reversible cycle and the inequality holds for an irreversible cycle. For a heat engine that exchanges heat only with two reservoirs at constant temperatures $T_{H}$ and $T_{C}$, this integral simplifies to a sum of two terms:\n$$\\frac{Q_{H}}{T_{H}} - \\frac{Q_{C}}{T_{C}} \\le 0$$\nThe first term is positive as heat $Q_{H}$ is added to the system at temperature $T_{H}$. The second term is negative as heat $Q_{C}$ is removed from the system at temperature $T_{C}$.\n\nRearranging the Clausius inequality, we find a lower bound for the heat rejected, $Q_{C}$:\n$$\\frac{Q_{C}}{T_{C}} \\ge \\frac{Q_{H}}{T_{H}}$$\n$$Q_{C} \\ge Q_{H} \\frac{T_{C}}{T_{H}}$$\nNow, we substitute this inequality into the First Law expression for work, $W = Q_{H} - Q_{C}$:\n$$W = Q_{H} - Q_{C} \\le Q_{H} - Q_{H} \\frac{T_{C}}{T_{H}}$$\nThe work output, $W$, is maximized when the heat rejected, $Q_{C}$, is minimized. The minimum possible value of $Q_{C}$ is achieved in a reversible cycle, for which the equality in the Clausius statement holds:\n$$Q_{C, \\mathrm{min}} = Q_{C, \\mathrm{rev}} = Q_{H} \\frac{T_{C}}{T_{H}}$$\nSubstituting this minimum heat rejection into the work equation gives the maximum possible work output, $W_{\\max}$, for a given heat input $Q_{H}$ and reservoir temperatures $T_{H}$ and $T_{C}$.\n$$W_{\\max} = Q_{H} - Q_{C, \\mathrm{min}} = Q_{H} - Q_{H} \\frac{T_{C}}{T_{H}}$$\nThus, the expression for the maximum theoretically attainable work output is:\n$$W_{\\max} = Q_{H} \\left(1 - \\frac{T_{C}}{T_{H}}\\right)$$\nThis corresponds to the work output of a reversible (Carnot) engine.\n\n**Calculation of Second-Law Efficiency ($\\eta_{\\mathrm{II}}$)**\n\nThe second-law efficiency, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{II}}$, is defined as the ratio of the actual work output, $W_{\\mathrm{real}}$, to the maximum possible work output, $W_{\\max}$.\n$$\\eta_{\\mathrm{II}} = \\frac{W_{\\mathrm{real}}}{W_{\\max}}$$\nFirst, we calculate the actual work output of the proposed real cycle using the First Law:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{real}} = Q_{H,\\mathrm{real}} - Q_{C,\\mathrm{real}}$$\nUsing the given values:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{real}} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{kJ} - 750\\ \\mathrm{kJ} = 250\\ \\mathrm{kJ}$$\nNext, we calculate the maximum possible work output for an engine that absorbs the same amount of heat, $Q_{H} = Q_{H,\\mathrm{real}} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{kJ}$, operating between the given temperatures $T_{H} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{K}$ and $T_{C} = 300\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n$$W_{\\max} = Q_{H} \\left(1 - \\frac{T_{C}}{T_{H}}\\right)$$\n$$W_{\\max} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{kJ} \\left(1 - \\frac{300\\ \\mathrm{K}}{1000\\ \\mathrm{K}}\\right) = 1000\\ \\mathrm{kJ} (1 - 0.3) = 1000\\ \\mathrm{kJ} (0.7) = 700\\ \\mathrm{kJ}$$\nFinally, we compute the second-law efficiency:\n$$\\eta_{\\mathrm{II}} = \\frac{W_{\\mathrm{real}}}{W_{\\max}} = \\frac{250\\ \\mathrm{kJ}}{700\\ \\mathrm{kJ}} = \\frac{25}{70} = \\frac{5}{14}$$\nTo express this as a decimal rounded to $4$ significant figures:\n$$\\eta_{\\mathrm{II}} \\approx 0.3571428...$$\nRounding gives:\n$$\\eta_{\\mathrm{II}} = 0.3571$$",

The cycle receives a prescribed heat input $Q_{in}$ at the hot-side boundary temperature $T_{H}^{b}$ and rejects heat $Q_{out}$ at the cold-side boundary temperature $T_{C}^{b}$.

The working fluid is dry air, modeled as an ideal gas with a temperature-dependent specific heat at constant pressure, $c_p(T)$.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the energy balance for a steady-flow open system is the first law of thermodynamics, which can be written on a per-unit-mass basis as:\n$$ q - w = \\Delta h + \\Delta ke + \\Delta pe $$\nHere, $q$ is the specific heat transfer, $w$ is the specific work, $\\Delta h$ is the change in specific enthalpy, $\\Delta ke$ is the change in specific kinetic energy, and $\\Delta pe$ is the change in specific potential energy.\n\nThe problem states that the compressor and turbine are adiabatic and have negligible changes in kinetic and potential energy.
