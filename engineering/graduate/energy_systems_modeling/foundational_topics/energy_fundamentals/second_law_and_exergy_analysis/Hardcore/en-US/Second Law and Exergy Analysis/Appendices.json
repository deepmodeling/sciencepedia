            "problem": "A rigid, homogeneous solid body of mass $m$ is initially at a uniform temperature $T_{1}$ and cools to the ambient environment temperature $T_{0}$ by direct heat transfer to the environment. The environment is a large reservoir at fixed temperature $T_{0}$ and pressure $p_{0}$, and the body undergoes no mechanical work interactions and no chemical reactions. The solid has a temperature-dependent specific heat capacity described by $c(T) = c_{0} + \\alpha T$ over the interval from $T_{0}$ to $T_{1}$, with $c_{0}  0$ and $\\alpha \\geq 0$. Assume the solid is effectively incompressible over the temperature range of interest so that volume change can be neglected.\n\nStarting from the fundamental statements of the first and second laws of thermodynamics for a closed system and from the core definitions of internal energy and entropy changes for a solid with temperature-dependent heat capacity, derive an expression for the availability (exergy) change of the body, defined relative to the environment at $T_{0}$ and $p_{0}$, between the initial state at $T_{1}$ and the final state at $T_{0}$. Express your final answer as a single closed-form expression in terms of $m$, $c_{0}$, $\\alpha$, $T_{1}$, and $T_{0}$. Interpret physically why a finite temperature dependence of the heat capacity influences the maximum extractable work when cooling from $T_{1}$ to $T_{0}$ via purely thermal contact with the environment.\n\nExpress the availability change in Joules. No rounding is required; provide the exact analytical expression.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is found to be valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. It represents a standard problem in exergy analysis within classical thermodynamics.\n\nThe availability, or exergy, $\\Psi$, of a closed system is its maximum potential for producing useful work as it is brought into equilibrium with a specified environment, or \"dead state,\" characterized by temperature $T_{0}$ and pressure $p_{0}$. The change in availability, $\\Delta \\Psi$, for a process from an initial state $1$ to a final state $2$ is given by the general expression:\n$$ \\Delta \\Psi = \\Psi_{2} - \\Psi_{1} = (U_{2} - U_{1}) - T_{0}(S_{2} - S_{1}) + p_{0}(V_{2} - V_{1}) $$\nwhere $U$ is internal energy, $S$ is entropy, and $V$ is volume.\n\nThe problem states that the solid body is rigid and effectively incompressible. This implies that its volume change during the cooling process is negligible, i.e., $V_{2} - V_{1} = \\Delta V \\approx 0$. Consequently, the term $p_{0}(V_{2} - V_{1})$ vanishes, and the expression for the availability change of the body simplifies to:\n$$ \\Delta \\Psi = (U_{2} - U_{1}) - T_{0}(S_{2} - S_{1}) = \\Delta U - T_{0} \\Delta S $$\nHere, the initial state $1$ is at temperature $T_{1}$ and the final state $2$ is at temperature $T_{0}$.\n\nWe must now derive the expressions for the change in internal energy, $\\Delta U$, and the change in entropy, $\\Delta S$, for the solid body as it cools from $T_{1}$ to $T_{0}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the change in internal energy, $\\Delta U$. For a substance with mass $m$ and specific heat capacity $c(T)$, the differential change in internal energy $dU$ during a temperature change $dT$ is given by $dU = m c(T) dT$, assuming negligible volume change. To find the total change from state $1$ to state $2$, we integrate this expression:\n$$ \\Delta U = U_{2} - U_{1} = \\int_{T_{1}}^{T_{0}} m c(T) \\,dT $$\nSubstituting the given temperature-dependent specific heat capacity, $c(T) = c_{0} + \\alpha T$:\n$$ \\Delta U = m \\int_{T_{1}}^{T_{0}} (c_{0} + \\alpha T) \\,dT $$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$ \\Delta U = m \\left[ c_{0}T + \\frac{\\alpha}{2}T^{2} \\right]_{T_{1}}^{T_{0}} $$\n$$ \\Delta U = m \\left( (c_{0}T_{0} + \\frac{\\alpha}{2}T_{0}^{2}) - (c_{0}T_{1} + \\frac{\\alpha}{2}T_{1}^{2}) \\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta U = m \\left[ c_{0}(T_{0} - T_{1}) + \\frac{\\alpha}{2}(T_{0}^{2} - T_{1}^{2}) \\right] $$\n\nNext, we calculate the change in entropy, $\\Delta S$. For a reversible process, the differential change in entropy is $dS = \\frac{\\delta Q_{rev}}{T}$. For a simple incompressible substance, the reversible heat transfer is $\\delta Q_{rev} = m c(T) dT$. Therefore, the entropy change is found by integrating:\n$$ \\Delta S = S_{2} - S_{1} = \\int_{T_{1}}^{T_{0}} \\frac{m c(T)}{T} \\,dT $$\nSubstituting $c(T) = c_{0} + \\alpha T$:\n$$ \\Delta S = m \\int_{T_{1}}^{T_{0}} \\frac{c_{0} + \\alpha T}{T} \\,dT = m \\int_{T_{1}}^{T_{0}} \\left(\\frac{c_{0}}{T} + \\alpha\\right) \\,dT $$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$ \\Delta S = m \\left[ c_{0}\\ln(T) + \\alpha T \\right]_{T_{1}}^{T_{0}} $$\n$$ \\Delta S = m \\left( (c_{0}\\ln(T_{0}) + \\alpha T_{0}) - (c_{0}\\ln(T_{1}) + \\alpha T_{1}) \\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta S = m \\left[ c_{0}(\\ln(T_{0}) - \\ln(T_{1})) + \\alpha(T_{0} - T_{1}) \\right] = m \\left[ c_{0}\\ln\\left(\\frac{T_{0}}{T_{1}}\\right) + \\alpha(T_{0} - T_{1}) \\right] $$\n\nNow we combine the expressions for $\\Delta U$ and $\\Delta S$ to find the availability change $\\Delta \\Psi$:\n$$ \\Delta \\Psi = \\Delta U - T_{0} \\Delta S $$\n$$ \\Delta \\Psi = m \\left[ c_{0}(T_{0} - T_{1}) + \\frac{\\alpha}{2}(T_{0}^{2} - T_{1}^{2}) \\right] - T_{0} \\left( m \\left[ c_{0}\\ln\\left(\\frac{T_{0}}{T_{1}}\\right) + \\alpha(T_{0} - T_{1}) \\right] \\right) $$\nFactoring out $m$ and grouping terms by $c_{0}$ and $\\alpha$:\n$$ \\Delta \\Psi = m \\left[ c_{0}(T_{0} - T_{1}) - T_{0}c_{0}\\ln\\left(\\frac{T_{0}}{T_{1}}\\right) + \\frac{\\alpha}{2}(T_{0}^{2} - T_{1}^{2}) - \\alpha T_{0}(T_{0} - T_{1}) \\right] $$\nLet's simplify the terms associated with $\\alpha$:\n$$ \\frac{\\alpha}{2}(T_{0}^{2} - T_{1}^{2}) - \\alpha T_{0}(T_{0} - T_{1}) = \\alpha \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(T_{0} - T_{1})(T_{0} + T_{1}) - T_{0}(T_{0} - T_{1}) \\right] $$\n$$ = \\alpha (T_{0} - T_{1}) \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(T_{0} + T_{1}) - T_{0} \\right] = \\alpha (T_{0} - T_{1}) \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}T_{1} - \\frac{1}{2}T_{0} \\right] $$\n$$ = -\\frac{\\alpha}{2} (T_{0} - T_{1})(T_{0} - T_{1}) = -\\frac{\\alpha}{2}(T_{0} - T_{1})^{2} $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\Delta \\Psi$:\n$$ \\Delta \\Psi = m \\left[ c_{0}\\left(T_{0} - T_{1} - T_{0}\\ln\\left(\\frac{T_{0}}{T_{1}}\\right)\\right) - \\frac{\\alpha}{2}(T_{0} - T_{1})^{2} \\right] $$\nTo make the argument of the logarithm greater than $1$ (since $T_{1}  T_{0}$), we can use the property $\\ln(x) = -\\ln(1/x)$:\n$$ \\Delta \\Psi = m \\left[ c_{0}\\left(T_{0} - T_{1} + T_{0}\\ln\\left(\\frac{T_{1}}{T_{0}}\\right)\\right) - \\frac{\\alpha}{2}(T_{1} - T_{0})^{2} \\right] $$\nNote that $(T_{0} - T_{1})^{2} = (T_{1} - T_{0})^{2}$. This is the final closed-form expression for the availability change.\n\nFor the physical interpretation, the availability of the body in its initial state, $\\Psi_{1}$, relative to the dead state at $T_{0}$ represents the maximum possible work that can be extracted as the body cools to $T_{0}$. The final state $2$ is the dead state (thermal equilibrium), so $\\Psi_{2} = 0$. Therefore, the maximum extractable work is $W_{max} = \\Psi_{1} - \\Psi_{2} = \\Psi_{1} = -\\Delta\\Psi$.\n$$ W_{max} = -\\Delta\\Psi = m \\left[ c_{0}\\left(T_{1} - T_{0} - T_{0}\\ln\\left(\\frac{T_{1}}{T_{0}}\\right)\\right) + \\frac{\\alpha}{2}(T_{1} - T_{0})^{2} \\right] $$\nThe term associated with the temperature dependence of the heat capacity is $\\frac{m\\alpha}{2}(T_{1} - T_{0})^{2}$. Since $\\alpha \\geq 0$ and $T_{1} \\neq T_{0}$, this term is non-negative. A positive $\\alpha$ signifies that the specific heat capacity $c(T)$ increases with temperature. This has two key consequences:\n$1$. The body stores more internal energy at higher temperatures compared to a body with a constant specific heat $c_{0}$. The total heat that must be extracted to cool the body from $T_{1}$ to $T_{0}$ is larger.\n$2$. This additional energy is stored at higher temperatures, where its thermodynamic \"quality\" or potential to do work is higher. The efficiency of any ideal heat engine converting this heat to work (e.g., a Carnot engine) is $\\eta = 1 - T_{0}/T$, which is an increasing function of the source temperature $T$.\nThe term $\\frac{m\\alpha}{2}(T_{1} - T_{0})^{2}$ precisely quantifies the extra athermal work potential (exergy) due to the fact that the heat capacity is not constant but increases with temperature. A model assuming a constant specific heat would therefore underestimate the maximum extractable work from the body.",

            "problem": "A vapor-compression chiller operates at steady state to remove a cooling load from a process. The process fluid entering the evaporator is well-mixed and maintained at a uniform cold-side temperature $T_L$, while heat is rejected to a large isothermal sink (the cooling tower loop) at temperature $T_H$. Assume negligible pressure drops, negligible changes in kinetic and potential energies, and that both the cold reservoir and the sink can be treated as infinite isothermal reservoirs. The chiller’s measured electrical power input to the compressor is the actual work rate $W_{\\text{act}}$.\n\nStarting from the Clausius statement of the Second Law of Thermodynamics and the definition of exergy associated with heat transfer to or from an isothermal reservoir, derive a general expression for the minimum theoretical work rate $W_{\\min}$ required by any refrigerator to remove a heat rate $\\dot{Q}_L$ from a reservoir at temperature $T_L$ while rejecting heat to a sink at temperature $T_H$. Use the reversible limit as the fundamental base for this derivation.

Round your final rational efficiency to four significant figures and express it as a pure decimal (unitless). Do not use a percentage sign.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the minimum theoretical work rate ($W_{\\min}$) for a refrigerator and the calculation of its rational efficiency. The derivation must be based on the Clausius statement of the Second Law of Thermodynamics and the concept of exergy.\n\nFirst, let us model the chiller as a thermodynamic system operating in a cycle that interacts with two thermal reservoirs: a cold reservoir at temperature $T_L$ and a hot reservoir at temperature $T_H$. The system operates at steady state.\n\nAccording to the First Law of Thermodynamics for a closed system undergoing a cycle (or a control volume at steady state), the net heat transfer is equal to the net work done. For a refrigerator, work is done *on* the system. Let the rate of heat removed from the cold reservoir be $\\dot{Q}_L$, the rate of heat rejected to the hot reservoir be $\\dot{Q}_H$, and the work rate input be $W$. The energy balance is:\n$$W + \\dot{Q}_L = \\dot{Q}_H$$\n\nThe Second Law of Thermodynamics, as articulated by the Clausius inequality for a cycle, states that the total change in entropy for the universe (system + surroundings) must be non-negative. For a device operating in a cycle, its own entropy change over a full cycle is zero. Thus, the total entropy generation rate, $\\dot{S}_{\\text{gen}}$, is due to the entropy changes in the reservoirs.\n$$\\dot{S}_{\\text{gen}} = \\Delta\\dot{S}_{\\text{reservoirs}} \\ge 0$$\nThe rate of entropy change of a reservoir is the heat transfer rate to it divided by its absolute temperature. The hot reservoir at $T_H$ receives heat $\\dot{Q}_H$, so its entropy increases. The cold reservoir at $T_L$ gives up heat $\\dot{Q}_L$, so its entropy decreases.\n$$\\dot{S}_{\\text{gen}} = \\frac{\\dot{Q}_H}{T_H} - \\frac{\\dot{Q}_L}{T_L} \\ge 0$$\n\nThe minimum work rate, $W_{\\min}$, corresponds to an ideal, reversible process where there are no irreversibilities, meaning the entropy generation rate is zero.\n$$\\dot{S}_{\\text{gen, rev}} = \\frac{\\dot{Q}_{H, \\text{rev}}}{T_H} - \\frac{\\dot{Q}_L}{T_L} = 0$$\nHere, $\\dot{Q}_{H, \\text{rev}}$ is the heat rejection rate for the reversible cycle. From this, we can find the relationship between the heat rates for a reversible refrigerator:\n$$\\dot{Q}_{H, \\text{rev}} = \\dot{Q}_L \\left( \\frac{T_H}{T_L} \\right)$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $\\dot{Q}_{H, \\text{rev}}$ into the First Law energy balance for the reversible case gives the minimum work rate, $W_{\\min}$:\n$$W_{\\min} = \\dot{Q}_{H, \\text{rev}} - \\dot{Q}_L$$\n$$W_{\\min} = \\dot{Q}_L \\left( \\frac{T_H}{T_L} \\right) - \\dot{Q}_L$$\n$$W_{\\min} = \\dot{Q}_L \\left( \\frac{T_H}{T_L} - 1 \\right) = \\dot{Q}_L \\left( \\frac{T_H - T_L}{T_L} \\right)$$\nThis expression represents the minimum theoretical power required to achieve the cooling load $\\dot{Q}_L$ given the temperatures $T_L$ and $T_H$.\n\nThis result can also be understood from the perspective of exergy (availability). The exergetic (or second-law) efficiency, also called rational efficiency, is defined as the ratio of the desired exergy output to the required exergy input. For this chiller, the desired exergy output is the exergy associated with the heat transfer $\\dot{Q}_L$ from the cold temperature $T_L$. The exergy of a heat transfer $\\dot{Q}$ at temperature $T$ relative to an environment at $T_0$ is $\\dot{E}_Q = \\dot{Q}(1 - T_0/T)$. Here, the environment is the hot sink at $T_H$, so $T_0 = T_H$. The exergy associated with the cooling effect is the minimum work required to create that effect, which we identify as $W_{\\min}$. This is the exergetic product of the chiller.\n$$\\text{Exergy product} = \\left| \\dot{Q}_L \\left( 1 - \\frac{T_H}{T_L} \\right) \\right| = \\dot{Q}_L \\left( \\frac{T_H}{T_L} - 1 \\right) = W_{\\min}$$\nThe exergy input is the actual electrical work rate, $W_{\\text{act}}$, which is high-grade energy and thus pure exergy.\n$$\\text{Exergy input} = W_{\\text{act}}$$\nThe rational efficiency $\\eta_{\\text{rational}}$ is defined as:\n$$\\eta_{\\text{rational}} = \\frac{\\text{Exergy product}}{\\text{Exergy input}} = \\frac{W_{\\min}}{W_{\\text{act}}}$$\nThe difference between the exergy input and the exergy product is the exergy destroyed by irreversibilities in the actual process: $\\dot{E}_{\\text{destroyed}} = W_{\\text{act}} - W_{\\min} \\ge 0$.\n\nNow, we evaluate the rational efficiency for the given operating conditions:\n-   Cooling load: $\\dot{Q}_L = 1.25 \\times 10^6 \\ \\text{W}$\n-   Cold-side temperature: $T_L = 279 \\ \\text{K}$\n-   Heat-sink temperature: $T_H = 307 \\ \\text{K}$\n-   Actual electrical work rate: $W_{\\text{act}} = 4.30 \\times 10^5 \\ \\text{W}$\n\nFirst, calculate the minimum theoretical work rate, $W_{\\min}$:\n$$W_{\\min} = \\dot{Q}_L \\left( \\frac{T_H - T_L}{T_L} \\right) = (1.25 \\times 10^6 \\ \\text{W}) \\left( \\frac{307 \\ \\text{K} - 279 \\ \\text{K}}{279 \\ \\text{K}} \\right)$$\n$$W_{\\min} = (1.25 \\times 10^6 \\ \\text{W}) \\left( \\frac{28}{279} \\right)$$\n$$W_{\\min} \\approx 125448.02867 \\ \\text{W}$$\n\nNext, calculate the rational efficiency, $\\eta_{\\text{rational}}$:\n$$\\eta_{\\text{rational}} = \\frac{W_{\\min}}{W_{\\text{act}}} = \\frac{125448.02867 \\ \\text{W}}{4.30 \\times 10^5 \\ \\text{W}}$$\n$$\\eta_{\\text{rational}} \\approx 0.2917396015...$$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures as required:\n$$\\eta_{\\text{rational}} \\approx 0.2917$$",

            "solution": "The user has provided a detailed problem statement for the analysis of a vapor-compression refrigeration system (VCRS). The problem is deemed valid as it is self-contained, scientifically grounded in the principles of thermodynamics, and well-posed. It provides a complete set of simplified, but consistent, models for refrigerant properties and cycle processes, along with all necessary constants and parameters. The task is to implement this model and calculate the exergetic efficiency and component-wise exergy destruction rates for a given set of test cases.\n\nThe solution proceeds by systematically calculating the thermodynamic properties at each of the four principal states of the refrigeration cycle. From these state properties, the rates of heat transfer, work, and exergy destruction are determined.\n\nThe following constants are given:\n- Reference temperature: $T_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 273.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- Specific heat of liquid: $c_{p,\\ell} = 1.4\\,\\mathrm{kJ}/(\\mathrm{kg}\\cdot\\mathrm{K})$\n- Specific heat of vapor (at constant pressure): $c_{p,v} = 0.9\\,\\mathrm{kJ}/(\\mathrm{kg}\\cdot\\mathrm{K})$\n- Isentropic exponent for vapor: $k = 1.25$\n- Reference latent heat of vaporization: $h_{\\mathrm{lat,ref}} = 200\\,\\mathrm{kJ}/\\mathrm{kg}$\n- Latent heat temperature coefficient: $\\alpha = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{kJ}/(\\mathrm{kg}\\cdot\\mathrm{K})$\n- Reference pressure scale: $p_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 3.0$ (dimensionless)\n- Clausius-type fit constant: $b = 2000$\n\nThe gas constant for the vapor is derived from the ideal gas relations: $R = c_{p,v} - c_{v,v} = c_{p,v} - c_{p,v}/k = c_{p,v}(1 - 1/k)$.\n$R = 0.9\\,\\mathrm{kJ}/(\\mathrm{kg}\\cdot\\mathrm{K}) \\times (1 - 1/1.25) = 0.18\\,\\mathrm{kJ}/(\\mathrm{kg}\\cdot\\mathrm{K})$.\n\nThe calculation for a given test case $(T_{\\mathrm{evap}}, T_{\\mathrm{cond}}, \\eta_{\\mathrm{is}}, \\dot{m}, T_0)$ follows these steps:\n\n**1. Define Refrigerant Property Models**\nThe specified property relations are implemented as functions of temperature $T$:\n- Saturated liquid enthalpy: $h_{\\ell}(T) = c_{p,\\ell}\\,(T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}})$\n- Saturated liquid entropy: $s_{\\ell}(T) = c_{p,\\ell}\\,\\ln(T/T_{\\mathrm{ref}})$\n- Latent heat: $h_{\\mathrm{lat}}(T) = h_{\\mathrm{lat,ref}} - \\alpha\\,(T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}})$\n- Saturated vapor enthalpy: $h_{v,\\mathrm{sat}}(T) = h_{\\ell}(T) + h_{\\mathrm{lat}}(T)$\n- Saturated vapor entropy: $s_{v,\\mathrm{sat}}(T) = s_{\\ell}(T) + h_{\\mathrm{lat}}(T)/T$\n- Saturation pressure: $p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T) = p_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\exp(b(1/T_{\\mathrm{ref}} - 1/T))$\n\n**2. Determine State Properties**\n\n**State 1: Compressor Inlet (Saturated Vapor at $T_{\\mathrm{evap}}$)**\nThe properties at the evaporator outlet are taken for saturated vapor at $T_1 = T_{\\mathrm{evap}}$.\n- Enthalpy: $h_1 = h_{v,\\mathrm{sat}}(T_{\\mathrm{evap}})$\n- Entropy: $s_1 = s_{v,\\mathrm{sat}}(T_{\\mathrm{evap}})$\n- Pressure: $p_1 = p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_{\\mathrm{evap}})$\n\n**State 2: Compressor Outlet**\nThe fluid is compressed from pressure $p_1$ to $p_2 = p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_{\\mathrm{cond}})$.\n- First, the isentropic outlet temperature $T_{2s}$ is found using the ideal gas relation:\n  $T_{2s} = T_1 \\left( \\dfrac{p_2}{p_1} \\right)^{(k-1)/k}$\n- The actual outlet temperature $T_2$ is calculated using the isentropic efficiency $\\eta_{\\mathrm{is}}$:\n  $T_2 = T_1 + \\dfrac{T_{2s} - T_1}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{is}}}$\n- The actual outlet enthalpy $h_2$ is determined using the ideal gas specific heat:\n  $h_2 = h_1 + c_{p,v}(T_2 - T_1)$\n- The actual outlet entropy $s_2$ is found from the ideal gas entropy change relation:\n  $s_2 = s_1 + c_{p,v}\\ln\\left(\\dfrac{T_2}{T_1}\\right) - R\\ln\\left(\\dfrac{p_2}{p_1}\\right)$\n\n**State 3: Condenser Outlet (Saturated Liquid at $T_{\\mathrm{cond}}$)**\nThe properties at the condenser outlet are for saturated liquid at $T_3 = T_{\\mathrm{cond}}$.\n- Enthalpy: $h_3 = h_{\\ell}(T_{\\mathrm{cond}})$\n- Entropy: $s_3 = s_{\\ell}(T_{\\mathrm{cond}})$\n\n**State 4: Expansion Valve Outlet**\nThe throttling process across the expansion valve is isenthalpic.\n- Enthalpy: $h_4 = h_3$\n- The refrigerant is a two-phase mixture at $T_{\\mathrm{evap}}$. Its quality $x_4$ is:\n  $x_4 = \\dfrac{h_4 - h_{\\ell}(T_{\\mathrm{evap}})}{h_{\\mathrm{lat}}(T_{\\mathrm{evap}})}$\n- The entropy $s_4$ is calculated using the quality:\n  $s_4 = s_{\\ell}(T_{\\mathrm{evap}}) + x_4 \\dfrac{h_{\\mathrm{lat}}(T_{\\mathrm{evap}})}{T_{\\mathrm{evap}}}$\n\n**3. Calculate Energy Rates and Performance Metrics**\n\nWith mass flow rate $\\dot{m}$, the energy interaction rates are calculated:\n- Refrigeration rate (heat absorbed in evaporator): $\\dot{Q}_{\\mathrm{evap}} = \\dot{m}\\,(h_1 - h_4)$\n- Compressor power input: $\\dot{W}_{\\mathrm{comp}} = \\dot{m}\\,(h_2 - h_1)$\n- Heat rejection rate (in condenser): $\\dot{Q}_{\\mathrm{cond}} = \\dot{m}\\,(h_2 - h_3)$\n\nThe exergetic efficiency $\\varepsilon$ is calculated using the definition provided:\n$\\varepsilon = \\dfrac{(1 - T_0/T_{\\mathrm{evap}})\\,\\dot{Q}_{\\mathrm{evap}}}{\\dot{W}_{\\mathrm{comp}}}$\n\n**4. Calculate Exergy Destruction Rates**\n\nFor each component, the rate of entropy generation $\\dot{S}_{\\mathrm{gen},i}$ is calculated, and the exergy destruction rate is found via $\\dot{D}_i = T_0\\,\\dot{S}_{\\mathrm{gen},i}$.\n\n- **Compressor:** $\\dot{S}_{\\mathrm{gen,comp}} = \\dot{m}(s_2 - s_1)$\n- **Condenser:** $\\dot{S}_{\\mathrm{gen,cond}} = \\dot{m}(s_3 - s_2) + \\dfrac{\\dot{Q}_{\\mathrm{cond}}}{T_{\\mathrm{cond}}}$\n- **Expansion Valve:** $\\dot{S}_{\\mathrm{gen,exp}} = \\dot{m}(s_4 - s_3)$\n- **Evaporator:** $\\dot{S}_{\\mathrm{gen,evap}} = \\dot{m}(s_1 - s_4) - \\dfrac{\\dot{Q}_{\\mathrm{evap}}}{T_{\\mathrm{evap}}}$\n\nNote: Based on the provided model, where heat transfer in the evaporator occurs between the refrigerant and a reservoir both at the same temperature $T_{\\mathrm{evap}}$, the exergy destruction $\\dot{D}_{\\mathrm{evap}}$ is analytically zero. This is a direct consequence of the idealization of no temperature difference for heat transfer.\n\nFinally, the computed values $[\\varepsilon, \\dot{D}_{\\mathrm{comp}}, \\dot{D}_{\\mathrm{cond}}, \\dot{D}_{\\mathrm{exp}}, \\dot{D}_{\\mathrm{evap}}]$ are assembled and rounded to six decimal digits for each test case.",
