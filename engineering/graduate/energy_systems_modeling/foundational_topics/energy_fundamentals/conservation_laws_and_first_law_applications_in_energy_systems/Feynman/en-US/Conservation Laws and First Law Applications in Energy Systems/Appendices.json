This exercise grounds your understanding of thermodynamic work by guiding you through the first-principles derivation of the boundary work for any such quasi-static polytropic process . Mastering this derivation provides a general tool and deepens your insight into how idealized process models for isobaric, isothermal, and isochoric conditions emerge as special cases.",

            "problem": "A closed, single-component working fluid contained in a frictionless piston-cylinder undergoes a quasi-static process from state $1$ to state $2$ governed by the polytropic path relation $pV^{n}=\\text{constant}$, where $p$ is pressure, $V$ is volume, and $n$ is a real exponent. The process is quasi-static so that the boundary (displacement) work is defined by $W=\\int p\\,dV$. Using only the First Law of Thermodynamics for a closed system, the definition of boundary work for a quasi-static process, and the given polytropic relation, derive an explicit closed-form expression for the boundary work $W$ in terms of $p_1$, $V_1$, $p_2$, $V_2$, and $n$ for the case $n\\neq 1$. Interpret the limiting cases $n\\to 1$, $n=0$, and $n\\to \\infty$ by connecting them to familiar process classes in energy systems and stating how the expression for $W$ behaves.\n\nExpress the final boundary work in Joules (J). Your final answer must be a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of $p_1$, $V_1$, $p_2$, $V_2$, and $n$.",
            "solution": "The objective is to derive an expression for the boundary work, $W$, for a closed system undergoing a quasi-static polytropic process. The process is defined by the relation $p V^n = C$, where $C$ is a constant, and $n$ is the polytropic exponent, with the specific constraint that $n \\neq 1$. The boundary work for a quasi-static process is given by the integral of pressure, $p$, with respect to volume, $V$.\n\nThe work done by the system on its surroundings, $W_{12}$, during a process from state $1$ to state $2$ is defined as:\n$$\nW_{12} = \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} p \\, dV\n$$\nFor a polytropic process, the pressure and volume are related by $p V^n = C$, where $C = p_1 V_1^n = p_2 V_2^n$. We can express the pressure as a function of volume:\n$$\np(V) = \\frac{C}{V^n} = C V^{-n}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $p(V)$ into the work integral gives:\n$$\nW_{12} = \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} C V^{-n} \\, dV\n$$\nSince $C$ is a constant, it can be moved outside the integral:\n$$\nW_{12} = C \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} V^{-n} \\, dV\n$$\nThe integral of $V^{-n}$ with respect to $V$ is $\\frac{V^{-n+1}}{-n+1}$, provided that $n \\neq 1$. The problem explicitly states this condition. Performing the integration, we get:\n$$\nW_{12} = C \\left[ \\frac{V^{1-n}}{1-n} \\right]_{V_1}^{V_2} = \\frac{C}{1-n} \\left( V_2^{1-n} - V_1^{1-n} \\right)\n$$\nTo express the work in terms of the initial and final pressures and volumes ($p_1, V_1, p_2, V_2$), we distribute the constant $C$ and substitute its value appropriately for each term. We use $C = p_2 V_2^n$ for the term involving $V_2$ and $C = p_1 V_1^n$ for the term involving $V_1$:\n$$\nW_{12} = \\frac{1}{1-n} \\left( C V_2^{1-n} - C V_1^{1-n} \\right) = \\frac{1}{1-n} \\left( (p_2 V_2^n) V_2^{1-n} - (p_1 V_1^n) V_1^{1-n} \\right)\n$$\nUsing the property of exponents $x^a x^b = x^{a+b}$, we simplify the terms within the parentheses:\n$$\np_2 V_2^n V_2^{1-n} = p_2 V_2^{n + (1-n)} = p_2 V_2^1 = p_2 V_2\n$$\n$$\np_1 V_1^n V_1^{1-n} = p_1 V_1^{n + (1-n)} = p_1 V_1^1 = p_1 V_1\n$$\nSubstituting these simplified terms back into the expression for work yields the final closed-form expression:\n$$\nW = \\frac{p_2 V_2 - p_1 V_1}{1 - n}\n$$\nThis expression is valid for any polytropic process where $n \\neq 1$. If pressure is measured in Pascals ($Pa = N/m^2$) and volume in cubic meters ($m^3$), the resulting work, $W$, will be in units of Joules ($J = N \\cdot m$).\n\nWe now interpret the limiting cases as requested.\n\n**Case $n=0$**:\nThe process relation becomes $p V^0 = p = \\text{constant}$. This corresponds to an isobaric (constant-pressure) process. Substituting $n=0$ into the derived work expression:\n$$\nW = \\frac{p_2 V_2 - p_1 V_1}{1 - 0} = p(V_2 - V_1)\n$$\nThis is the correct formula for boundary work during a quasi-static isobaric process.\n\n**Case $n \\to \\infty$**:\nFrom the relation $V_2/V_1 = (p_1/p_2)^{1/n}$, as $n \\to \\infty$, the exponent $1/n \\to 0$, so $V_2/V_1 \\to 1$, which implies $V_1 = V_2$. Therefore, the limit $n \\to \\infty$ corresponds to an isochoric (constant-volume) process. In an isochoric process, $dV=0$, so the work integral $W = \\int p \\, dV$ is identically zero. Our derived formula gives:\n$$\nW = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{(p_2 - p_1)V}{1 - n} = 0\n$$\nThis matches the expected result.\n\n**Case $n \\to 1$**:\nThe process relation approaches $pV=\\text{constant}$. For an ideal gas, this is an isothermal (constant-temperature) process. The derived expression $W = \\frac{p_2 V_2 - p_1 V_1}{1-n}$ approaches the indeterminate form $0/0$. To evaluate the limit, we use L'Hôpital's rule. Let's rewrite the work expression solely in terms of initial state variables and the volume ratio, using $p_2 = p_1(V_1/V_2)^n$:\n$$\nW(n) = \\frac{p_1 V_1 \\left[ \\left(\\frac{V_1}{V_2}\\right)^{n-1} - 1 \\right]}{1-n}\n$$\nTaking the derivatives of the numerator $f(n) = p_1 V_1 [ (V_1/V_2)^{n-1} - 1 ]$ and denominator $g(n) = 1-n$ with respect to $n$:\n$$\nf'(n) = p_1 V_1 \\left[ \\left(\\frac{V_1}{V_2}\\right)^{n-1} \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_1}{V_2}\\right) \\right] \\implies f'(1) = p_1 V_1 \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_1}{V_2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\ng'(n) = -1 \\implies g'(1) = -1\n$$\nBy L'Hôpital's rule, the limit is:\n$$\n\\lim_{n \\to 1} W(n) = \\frac{f'(1)}{g'(1)} = \\frac{p_1 V_1 \\ln(V_1/V_2)}{-1} = p_1 V_1 \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_2}{V_1}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the correct expression for work done in a process governed by $pV = \\text{constant}$. The derived general formula is therefore consistent with all fundamental thermodynamic process types in the appropriate limits.",
