The State of Charge (SOC) upon arrival at time $t = 18{:}00$ is $\\text{SOC}_{0} = 0.30$, and the EV must depart at time $t = 07{:}00$ with $\\text{SOC}_{T} = 0.80$. The maximum charging power and maximum discharging power are both $P_{\\max} = 7~\\text{kW}$. Assume constant conversion efficiencies, no auxiliary loads, and no thermal losses. The round-trip efficiency is $\\eta_{\\text{rt}} = 0.90$. In the absence of separate efficiency specifications, assume symmetric charging and discharging efficiencies so that the charging efficiency $\\eta_{\\text{ch}}$ and discharging efficiency $\\eta_{\\text{dis}}$ satisfy $\\eta_{\\text{ch}} = \\eta_{\\text{dis}}$ and $\\eta_{\\text{ch}} \\eta_{\\text{dis}} = \\eta_{\\text{rt}}$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the maximum feasible value of the net energy supplied to the grid, $E_{\\text{net}}$, by an electric vehicle (EV) over a specified time horizon, subject to operational constraints.\n\nFirst, we formalize the problem using the principle of energy conservation for the battery. Let $E(t)$ be the energy stored in the EV's battery at time $t$. The state of charge, $\\text{SOC}(t)$, is related to the stored energy by $E(t) = \\text{SOC}(t) \\cdot E_{\\text{cap}}$, where $E_{\\text{cap}}$ is the nominal energy capacity of the battery.\n\nThe rate of change of stored energy, $\\frac{dE(t)}{dt}$, is determined by the power flows to and from the battery. When charging, power $P_{\\text{ch}}(t)$ is drawn from the grid, and a fraction $\\eta_{\\text{ch}}$ of this power increases the stored energy. When discharging, power $P_{\\text{dis}}(t)$ is supplied to the grid, which requires drawing power from the battery at a rate of $P_{\\text{dis}}(t)/\\eta_{\\text{dis}}$. The instantaneous energy balance equation is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{dE(t)}{dt} = \\eta_{\\text{ch}} P_{\\text{ch}}(t) - \\frac{1}{\\eta_{\\text{dis}}} P_{\\text{dis}}(t)\n$$\nwhere $P_{\\text{ch}}(t) \\ge 0$ is the charging power from the grid and $P_{\\text{dis}}(t) \\ge 0$ is the discharging power to the grid.\n\nWe can integrate this differential equation over the time horizon from the arrival time $t_0 = 18{:}00$ to the departure time $t_f = 07{:}00$.\n$$\n\\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\frac{dE(t)}{dt} dt = \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\left( \\eta_{\\text{ch}} P_{\\text{ch}}(t) - \\frac{1}{\\eta_{\\text{dis}}} P_{\\text{dis}}(t) \\right) dt\n$$\nThe left side is $E(t_f) - E(t_0)$. Let's define the total energy charged from the grid as $E_{\\text{ch,grid}} = \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} P_{\\text{ch}}(t) dt$ and the total energy discharged to the grid as $E_{\\text{dis,grid}} = \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} P_{\\text{dis}}(t) dt$. The integrated energy balance becomes:\n$$\nE(t_f) - E(t_0) = \\eta_{\\text{ch}} E_{\\text{ch,grid}} - \\frac{1}{\\eta_{\\text{dis}}} E_{\\text{dis,grid}}\n$$\nThe change in stored energy can be expressed using the given state of charge values:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\text{stored}} = E(t_f) - E(t_0) = E_{\\text{cap}} (\\text{SOC}_{T} - \\text{SOC}_{0})\n$$\nThe objective is to maximize the net energy supplied to the grid, which is defined as:\n$$\nE_{\\text{net}} = E_{\\text{dis,grid}} - E_{\\text{ch,grid}}\n$$\nTo solve this optimization problem, we express the objective function in terms of a single variable. From the integrated energy balance equation, we can solve for $E_{\\text{ch,grid}}$:\n$$\n\\eta_{\\text{ch}} E_{\\text{ch,grid}} = \\Delta E_{\\text{stored}} + \\frac{1}{\\eta_{\\text{dis}}} E_{\\text{dis,grid}}\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\text{ch,grid}} = \\frac{\\Delta E_{\\text{stored}}}{\\eta_{\\text{ch}}} + \\frac{1}{\\eta_{\\text{ch}}\\eta_{\\text{dis}}} E_{\\text{dis,grid}}\n$$\nUsing the definition $\\eta_{\\text{rt}} = \\eta_{\\text{ch}}\\eta_{\\text{dis}}$, we have:\n$$\nE_{\\text{ch,grid}} = \\frac{\\Delta E_{\\text{stored}}}{\\eta_{\\text{ch}}} + \\frac{1}{\\eta_{\\text{rt}}} E_{\\text{dis,grid}}\n$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $E_{\\text{ch,grid}}$ into the definition of $E_{\\text{net}}$:\n$$\nE_{\\text{net}} = E_{\\text{dis,grid}} - \\left( \\frac{\\Delta E_{\\text{stored}}}{\\eta_{\\text{ch}}} + \\frac{1}{\\eta_{\\text{rt}}} E_{\\text{dis,grid}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\text{net}} = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\eta_{\\text{rt}}}\\right) E_{\\text{dis,grid}} - \\frac{\\Delta E_{\\text{stored}}}{\\eta_{\\text{ch}}}\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{\\Delta E_{\\text{stored}}}{\\eta_{\\text{ch}}}$ is a constant determined by the problem's boundary conditions. To maximize $E_{\\text{net}}$, we must analyze the coefficient of the variable $E_{\\text{dis,grid}}$, which is $\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\eta_{\\text{rt}}}\\right)$.\nGiven $\\eta_{\\text{rt}} = 0.90$, which is less than $1$, its reciprocal $\\frac{1}{\\eta_{\\text{rt}}}$ is greater than $1$. Therefore, the coefficient $\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\eta_{\\text{rt}}}\\right)$ is negative.\n$$\n\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{0.90}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{0.90 - 1}{0.90}\\right) = -\\frac{0.10}{0.90} = -\\frac{1}{9} < 0\n$$\nSince the coefficient is negative, maximizing the linear function $E_{\\text{net}}$ requires minimizing the variable $E_{\\text{dis,grid}}$. The physical constraint on discharging power is $P_{\\text{dis}}(t) \\geq 0$, which implies that the total energy discharged must also be non-negative, $E_{\\text{dis,grid}} \\geq 0$. Thus, the minimum possible value for $E_{\\text{dis,grid}}$ is $0$.\n\nThis strategy, which sets $E_{\\text{dis,grid}} = 0$ (i.e., no discharging), is physically feasible. The battery's state of charge must increase from $\\text{SOC}_{0} = 0.30$ to $\\text{SOC}_{T} = 0.80$. A pure charging strategy, where $\\text{SOC}(t)$ monotonically increases, will always satisfy the constraint $0 \\leq \\text{SOC}(t) \\leq 1$. The required energy can be delivered within the given time and power limits.\n\nBy setting $E_{\\text{dis,grid}} = 0$, the expression for the maximum net energy becomes:\n$$\nE_{\\text{net,max}} = -\\frac{\\Delta E_{\\text{stored}}}{\\eta_{\\text{ch}}}\n$$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values:\n$E_{\\text{cap}} = 60~\\text{kWh}$\n$\\text{SOC}_{0} = 0.30$\n$\\text{SOC}_{T} = 0.80$\n$\\eta_{\\text{rt}} = 0.90$\n$\\eta_{\\text{ch}} = \\sqrt{\\eta_{\\text{rt}}} = \\sqrt{0.90}$\n\nFirst, calculate the required change in stored energy:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\text{stored}} = E_{\\text{cap}} (\\text{SOC}_{T} - \\text{SOC}_{0}) = 60~\\text{kWh} \\times (0.80 - 0.30) = 60 \\times 0.50 = 30~\\text{kWh}\n$$\nNow, calculate the maximum net energy:\n$$\nE_{\\text{net,max}} = -\\frac{30}{\\sqrt{0.90}}~\\text{kWh}\n$$\nNumerically, this is:\n$$\nE_{\\text{net,max}} \\approx -\\frac{30}{0.948683298} \\approx -31.6227766~\\text{kWh}\n$$\nRounding the answer to four significant figures, we get $-31.62~\\text{kWh}$.\nThis result demonstrates that any energy cycling through the battery incurs losses, making the net energy exchange with the grid more negative. To obtain the maximum (i.e., least negative) value for $E_{\\text{net}}$, all cycling must be eliminated, and only the necessary charging to meet the final SOC target should be performed.",

Let's expand and rearrange the equation, isolating the terms containing $c_{\\mathrm{deg}}^{\\ast}$:\n$$0 = \\alpha \\left[ E_{A} \\left( p_{h}^{A} - \\frac{p_{\\ell}^{A} + g_{\\mathrm{in}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}} \\right) - f \\right] - \\alpha E_A c_{\\mathrm{deg}}^{\\ast} + (1-\\alpha) \\left[ E_{B} \\left( p_{h}^{B} - \\frac{p_{\\ell}^{B} + g_{\\mathrm{in}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}} \\right) - f \\right] - (1-\\alpha) E_B c_{\\mathrm{deg}}^{\\ast}$$\nCombining the fixed cost terms $- \\alpha f - (1-\\alpha)f = -(\\alpha + 1 - \\alpha)f = -f$, and moving the $c_{\\mathrm{deg}}^{\\ast}$ terms to the left side:\n$$c_{\\mathrm{deg}}^{\\ast}(\\alpha E_A + (1-\\alpha) E_B) = \\alpha E_A \\left( p_{h}^{A} - \\frac{p_{\\ell}^{A} + g_{\\mathrm{in}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}} \\right) + (1-\\alpha) E_B \\left( p_{h}^{B} - \\frac{p_{\\ell}^{B} + g_{\\mathrm{in}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}} \\right) - f$$\nThe term $\\alpha E_A + (1-\\alpha) E_B$ is the expected discharged energy per cycle, $E[E_{\\mathrm{dis}}]$. The right-hand side of the equation represents the expected profit per cycle *before* accounting for degradation cost. Dividing by the expected discharged energy gives the breakeven cost per unit of discharged energy:\n$$c_{\\mathrm{deg}}^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\alpha E_A \\left( p_{h}^{A} - \\frac{p_{\\ell}^{A} + g_{\\mathrm{in}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}} \\right) + (1-\\alpha) E_B \\left( p_{h}^{B} - \\frac{p_{\\ell}^{B} + g_{\\mathrm{in}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}} \\right) - f}{\\alpha E_A + (1-\\alpha) E_B}$$\nThis is the derived analytical expression for the breakeven degradation cost.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}} = 0.9$\n$f = 0.12$ USD\n$g_{\\mathrm{in}} = 0.012$ USD/kWh\n$\\alpha = 0.6$\n$E_{A} = 12$ kWh, $p_{h}^{A} = 0.24$ USD/kWh, $p_{\\ell}^{A} = 0.07$ USD/kWh\n$E_{B} = 8$ kWh, $p_{h}^{B} = 0.19$ USD/kWh, $p_{\\ell}^{B} = 0.06$ USD/kWh\n\nFirst, calculate the denominator, which is the expected discharged energy per cycle, $E[E_{\\mathrm{dis}}]$:\n$$E[E_{\\mathrm{dis}}] = \\alpha E_A + (1-\\alpha) E_B = (0.6)(12) + (0.4)(8) = 7.2 + 3.2 = 10.4 \\, \\text{kWh}$$\nNext, we calculate the terms in the numerator.\nFor Class A, the effective cost of delivered energy is $\\frac{p_{\\ell}^{A} + g_{\\mathrm{in}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}} = \\frac{0.07 + 0.012}{0.9} = \\frac{0.082}{0.9}$ USD/kWh.\nThe gross margin for Class A (before fixed cost and degradation) is:\n$$E_A \\left( p_{h}^{A} - \\frac{p_{\\ell}^{A} + g_{\\mathrm{in}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}} \\right) = 12 \\left( 0.24 - \\frac{0.082}{0.9} \\right) \\approx 12(0.24 - 0.09111...) = 12(0.14888...) = 1.78666... \\, \\text{USD}$$\nFor Class B, the effective cost of delivered energy is $\\frac{p_{\\ell}^{B} + g_{\\mathrm{in}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}} = \\frac{0.06 + 0.012}{0.9} = \\frac{0.072}{0.9} = 0.08$ USD/kWh.\nThe gross margin for Class B is:\n$$E_B \\left( p_{h}^{B} - \\frac{p_{\\ell}^{B} + g_{\\mathrm{in}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}} \\right) = 8 \\left( 0.19 - 0.08 \\right) = 8(0.11) = 0.88 \\, \\text{USD}$$\nNow, we compute the numerator, which is the expected gross margin minus the fixed cost:\n$$\\text{Numerator} = (0.6)(1.78666...) + (0.4)(0.88) - 0.12 = 1.072 + 0.352 - 0.12 = 1.304 \\, \\text{USD}$$\nFinally, we compute the breakeven degradation cost $c_{\\mathrm{deg}}^{\\ast}$:\n$$c_{\\mathrm{deg}}^{\\ast} = \\frac{1.304}{10.4} \\approx 0.1253846... \\, \\text{USD/kWh}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $c_{\\mathrm{deg}}^{\\ast} = 0.1254$ USD/kWh.\n\nThe breakeven degradation cost, $c_{\\mathrm{deg}}^{\\ast}$, represents the maximum allowable cost of battery wear per kilowatt-hour of energy discharged for the V2G arbitrage operation to be economically viable on average. If the actual degradation cost is higher than this value, the aggregator will lose money; if it is lower, the aggregator will make a profit.\n\nThis value is a crucial parameter for designing V2G participation strategies. Specifically, an aggregator should only dispatch a vehicle for an arbitrage cycle if the expected profit from that cycle can cover the vehicle's specific degradation cost. The value $c_{\\mathrm{deg}}^{\\ast}$ represents the average available margin (per kWh) to cover this degradation cost. Therefore, vehicles with an estimated degradation cost higher than this value are not profitable candidates for this specific arbitrage service mix. This breakeven cost serves as a dynamic participation threshold that should be continuously updated based on market prices.\n\nRegarding tariff structures, $c_{\\mathrm{deg}}^{\\ast}$ sets an upper bound on what the aggregator can afford to pay vehicle owners as compensation for using their battery. The aggregator's profit margin is the difference between this breakeven value and the sum of the actual degradation cost and the tariff paid to the EV owner. For a sustainable business model, the aggregator must design tariffs (e.g., per-kWh payments to owners) that are attractive enough to incentivize participation but low enough to leave a positive profit margin. The breakeven value quantifies the total financial \"space\" available per kWh to be shared between covering the physical cost of battery wear and generating profit for both the aggregator and the vehicle owner.",
