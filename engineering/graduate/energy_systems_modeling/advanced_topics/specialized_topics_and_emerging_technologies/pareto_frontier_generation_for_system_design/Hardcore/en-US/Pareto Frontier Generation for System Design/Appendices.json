The concepts of Pareto optimality, convex functions, and the weighted-sum scalarization method are standard and fundamental in optimization theory and its applications, including energy systems modeling. The functions provided are simple, well-behaved convex polynomials. The problem is scientifically and mathematically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly defined with all necessary components. The objectives, decision variable domain, and optimization method are explicitly given. The functions are analytic and strictly convex, which guarantees the existence of a unique minimizer for the scalarized objective for any given $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$. The problem is well-posed.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using formal, precise mathematical language, free from ambiguity or subjective content.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains a complete and consistent setup for a standard multiobjective optimization exercise. Therefore, I will proceed with the solution.\n\nA solution $x^{\\star}$ is defined as Pareto optimal if there is no other feasible solution $x$ that dominates it. That is, there exists no $x$ such that $f_{i}(x) \\leq f_{i}(x^{\\star})$ for all objectives $i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$ and $f_{j}(x) < f_{j}(x^{\\star})$ for at least one objective $j \\in \\{1, 2\\}$. The set of all objective vectors corresponding to Pareto optimal solutions, i.e., $\\big(f_{1}(x^{\\star}), f_{2}(x^{\\star})\\big)$, constitutes the Pareto frontier.\n\nThe weighted-sum method combines the multiple objectives into a single scalar objective function, $g_{\\lambda}(x)$, which is then minimized. The scalarized objective is given by:\n$$g_{\\lambda}(x) = \\lambda f_{1}(x) + (1-\\lambda) f_{2}(x)$$\nSubstituting the given functions for $f_{1}(x)$ and $f_{2}(x)$:\n$$g_{\\lambda}(x) = \\lambda x^{2} + (1-\\lambda)(x-2)^{2}$$\nThe functions $f_{1}(x)=x^{2}$ and $f_{2}(x)=(x-2)^{2}$ are strictly convex. Since $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$, the function $g_{\\lambda}(x)$ is a non-negative linear combination of convex functions, and is therefore itself a convex function. For $\\lambda \\in (0,1)$, $g_{\\lambda}(x)$ is strictly convex. For a differentiable convex function defined over $\\mathbb{R}$, its global minimum occurs at any point $x$ where its first derivative is zero.\n\nWe calculate the derivative of $g_{\\lambda}(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$ \\frac{d g_{\\lambda}}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ \\lambda x^{2} + (1-\\lambda)(x-2)^{2} \\right] $$\n$$ \\frac{d g_{\\lambda}}{dx} = 2\\lambda x + 2(1-\\lambda)(x-2) $$\n$$ \\frac{d g_{\\lambda}}{dx} = 2\\lambda x + 2x - 4 - 2\\lambda x + 4\\lambda $$\n$$ \\frac{d g_{\\lambda}}{dx} = 2x - 4 + 4\\lambda $$\nTo find the minimizer $x^{\\star}(\\lambda)$, we set the derivative to zero:\n$$ 2x^{\\star}(\\lambda) - 4 + 4\\lambda = 0 $$\n$$ 2x^{\\star}(\\lambda) = 4 - 4\\lambda $$\n$$ x^{\\star}(\\lambda) = 2 - 2\\lambda = 2(1-\\lambda) $$\nThis expression for the minimizer is valid for all $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$. We can check the boundary cases:\n- For $\\lambda=1$, we minimize $g_{1}(x)=f_{1}(x)=x^{2}$, whose minimum is at $x=0$. Our formula gives $x^{\\star}(1) = 2(1-1) = 0$.\n- For $\\lambda=0$, we minimize $g_{0}(x)=f_{2}(x)=(x-2)^{2}$, whose minimum is at $x=2$. Our formula gives $x^{\\star}(0) = 2(1-0) = 2$.\nThe formula is therefore correct for the entire interval $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding point on the Pareto frontier in the objective space by substituting $x^{\\star}(\\lambda)$ back into the objective functions $f_{1}(x)$ and $f_{2}(x)$.\n\nFor the first objective, $f_{1}$:\n$$ f_{1}(x^{\\star}(\\lambda)) = (x^{\\star}(\\lambda))^{2} = \\big(2(1-\\lambda)\\big)^{2} = 4(1-\\lambda)^{2} $$\nFor the second objective, $f_{2}$:\n$$ f_{2}(x^{\\star}(\\lambda)) = (x^{\\star}(\\lambda)-2)^{2} = \\big(2(1-\\lambda) - 2\\big)^{2} = (2 - 2\\lambda - 2)^{2} = (-2\\lambda)^{2} = 4\\lambda^{2} $$\nThus, the Pareto optimal solutions in the decision space are given by $x^{\\star}(\\lambda)=2(1-\\lambda)$ and the corresponding points on the Pareto frontier are $\\big(4(1-\\lambda)^{2}, 4\\lambda^{2}\\big)$ for $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$.\n\nThe problem also requires justification for why the weighted-sum method recovers the entire Pareto frontier in this case. A fundamental theorem in multiobjective optimization states that for a convex optimization problem, the set of Pareto optimal solutions is identical to the set of solutions obtained by minimizing the weighted-sum scalarization $g_{\\lambda}(x)$ for all possible weight combinations where $\\lambda_i \\ge 0$ and $\\sum \\lambda_i = 1$.\nThis problem is a convex optimization problem because:\n1. The domain of the decision variable, $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, is a convex set.\n2. The objective functions, $f_{1}(x)=x^{2}$ and $f_{2}(x)=(x-2)^{2}$, are both convex functions (their second derivatives are $f_{1}''(x)=2 > 0$ and $f_{2}''(x)=2 > 0$).\nSince the problem is convex, every Pareto optimal point corresponds to the solution of a weighted-sum problem for some $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$. Therefore, by varying $\\lambda$ over its full range $[0,1]$, we are guaranteed to map out the entire Pareto frontier. The frontier itself is a convex curve in the objective space, as expected for a convex problem.\n\nThe final deliverable is the compact analytic expression for the row vector $\\big(x^{\\star}(\\lambda), f_{1}(x^{\\star}(\\lambda)), f_{2}(x^{\\star}(\\lambda))\\big)$. Based on our derivations:\n- $x^{\\star}(\\lambda) = 2(1-\\lambda)$\n- $f_{1}(x^{\\star}(\\lambda)) = 4(1-\\lambda)^{2}$\n- $f_{2}(x^{\\star}(\\lambda)) = 4\\lambda^{2}$\n\nThe resulting row vector is $\\begin{pmatrix} 2(1-\\lambda) & 4(1-\\lambda)^{2} & 4\\lambda^{2} \\end{pmatrix}$.",

The problem is a standard application of these formal methods.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a finite set of points, clear definitions for the objectives (minimization), and a precise algorithm for calculating the desired quantity (hypervolume).

The values are numerically consistent; the reference point $(120, 900)$ is positioned to be weakly dominated by all candidate designs, as stated, since for any point $(x,y)$ among the candidates, $x < 120$ and $y < 900$. There are no contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-defined mathematical exercise in the field of multi-objective optimization. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution process involves two main parts: first, identifying the subset of non-dominated designs, and second, calculating the hypervolume of this subset with respect to the given reference point.\n\n#### Part 1: Identification of the Non-dominated Subset\n\nIn a biobjective minimization problem, a point $P_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ is said to **dominate** another point $P_2 = (x_2, y_2)$, denoted $P_1 \\prec P_2$, if $x_1 \\le x_2$ and $y_1 \\le y_2$, with at least one inequality being strict (i.e., $(x_1, y_1) \\ne (x_2, y_2)$). A point is non-dominated if no other point in the set dominates it.\n\nThe set of candidate designs is $S = \\{A, B, C, D, E, F\\}$, with coordinates:\n-   $A = (60, 300)$\n-   $B = (80, 250)$\n-   $C = (90, 400)$\n-   $D = (70, 500)$\n-   $E = (55, 600)$\n-   $F = (65, 240)$\n\nWe perform pairwise comparisons to find dominated points:\n1.  Compare $A(60, 300)$ with others:\n    -   vs $C(90, 400)$: Since $60 < 90$ and $300 < 400$, $A$ dominates $C$. Point $C$ is dominated.\n    -   vs $D(70, 500)$: Since $60 < 70$ and $300 < 500$, $A$ dominates $D$. Point $D$ is dominated.\n2.  Compare $B(80, 250)$ with others not yet dominated (A, E, F):\n    -   vs $F(65, 240)$: Since $65 < 80$ and $240 < 250$, $F$ dominates $B$. Point $B$ is dominated.\n\nThe points found to be dominated are $B$, $C$, and $D$. The remaining points are checked for mutual non-dominance:\n-   $A = (60, 300)$\n-   $E = (55, 600)$\n-   $F = (65, 240)$\n\n-   $E$ vs $A$: $x_E < x_A$ ($55 < 60$), but $y_E > y_A$ ($600 > 300$). Neither dominates.\n-   $E$ vs $F$: $x_E < x_F$ ($55 < 65$), but $y_E > y_F$ ($600 > 240$). Neither dominates.\n-   $A$ vs $F$: $x_A < x_F$ ($60 < 65$), but $y_A > y_F$ ($300 > 240$). Neither dominates.\n\nThe points $A$, $E$, and $F$ are mutually non-dominating. Therefore, the non-dominated subset is $S_{ND} = \\{A, E, F\\}$.\n\n#### Part 2: Hypervolume Calculation\n\nThe hypervolume $HV$ is the area of the union of rectangles formed by each non-dominated point and the reference point $r = (120, 900)$. The non-dominated points are:\n-   $E = (55, 600)$\n-   $A = (60, 300)$\n-   $F = (65, 240)$\n\nTo simplify the calculation, we sort the non-dominated points by their first coordinate, $x$, in increasing order. This results in the sequence $E, A, F$:\n-   $p_1 = E = (x_1, y_1) = (55, 600)$\n-   $p_2 = A = (x_2, y_2) = (60, 300)$\n-   $p_3 = F = (x_3, y_3) = (65, 240)$\n\nNote that for a set of non-dominated points in a 2D minimization problem, sorting by one coordinate in increasing order results in the other coordinate being sorted in decreasing order ($x_1 < x_2 < x_3$ implies $y_1 > y_2 > y_3$). Here, $55 < 60 < 65$ and $600 > 300 > 240$, confirming their non-dominance.\n\nThe total area (hypervolume) is the integral of the upper envelope function defined by the reference point minus the lower envelope defined by the Pareto front, from the minimum $x$ value in the front to the reference $x$ value.\n$$ HV = \\int_{x_1}^{r_1} (r_2 - y_{\\text{front}}(x)) dx $$\nThe lower envelope $y_{\\text{front}}(x)$ is a step function determined by the sorted non-dominated points:\n$$ y_{\\text{front}}(x) = \\begin{cases} y_1 = 600 & \\text{if } 55 \\le x < 60 \\\\ y_2 = 300 & \\text{if } 60 \\le x < 65 \\\\ y_3 = 240 & \\text{if } 65 \\le x \\le 120 \\end{cases} $$\nThe integral can be decomposed into a sum of areas of disjoint rectangles:\n$$ HV = \\int_{55}^{60} (900 - 600) dx + \\int_{60}^{65} (900 - 300) dx + \\int_{65}^{120} (900 - 240) dx $$\nCalculating each term:\n-   Area 1: $(60 - 55) \\times (900 - 600) = 5 \\times 300 = 1500$\n-   Area 2: $(65 - 60) \\times (900 - 300) = 5 \\times 600 = 3000$\n-   Area 3: $(120 - 65) \\times (900 - 240) = 55 \\times 660 = 36300$\n\nThe total hypervolume is the sum of these areas:\n$$ HV = 1500 + 3000 + 36300 = 40800 $$\nThe units of this hypervolume are $(\\$/\\mathrm{MWh})\\cdot(\\mathrm{kg}\\ \\mathrm{CO}_2/\\mathrm{MWh})$.\nThe problem asks for the result to be rounded to $4$ significant figures. The calculated value, $40800$, is exact. To unambiguously represent this value with 4 significant figures, we use scientific notation: $4.080 \\times 10^4$.",

Let the objective vector for design $D_{i}$ be $(c_{i}, e_{i})$, where $c_{i}$ is the normalized cost and $e_{i}$ is the normalized emissions. The planner uses the following foundational concepts:\n\n- Pareto dominance: A design $A$ is said to Pareto-dominate a design $B$ if $c_{A} \\leq c_{B}$ and $e_{A} \\leq e_{B}$, with at least one strict inequality.\n- Pareto frontier: The set of designs not dominated by any others.\n- Weighted-sum scalarization: For weight $w \\in [0,1]$, the scalarized objective for a design $(c,e)$ is $w c + (1 - w) e$.\n- Hypervolume indicator: In two dimensions, given a reference point $(r_{c}, r_{e})$ with $r_{c} \\geq c_{i}$ and $r_{e} \\geq e_{i}$ for all designs included, the hypervolume is the area of the region of points $(c,e)$ such that $c \\in [c_{i}, r_{c}]$ and $e \\in [e_{i}, r_{e}]$, unioned over all designs in the set.\n\nSuppose the planner seeks to construct an example with three designs $D_{A}$, $D_{B}$, and $D_{C}$ that are mutually nondominated (no design dominates either of the other two), and to examine implications for decision making.

These are core tools in engineering design and systems analysis. The application to energy systems is appropriate and realistic. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posedness:** The problem provides a set of conditions that can be translated into a system of algebraic equations to find the unknowns $b$ and $w$. The mutual nondominance condition establishes clear inequalities. The weighted-sum equality provides two equations, $S(D_A)=S(D_C)$ and $S(D_A)=S(D_B)$. The first equation depends only on $w$, and the second relates $w$ and $b$. This structure suggests a unique solution can be found. The hypervolume calculation is a standard procedure given a set of points and a reference point.\n3.  **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, mathematical language, free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency:** The givens are sufficient to solve for the unknowns. The condition that $b>0$ and the derived constraints on $b$ from the nondominance requirement are consistent with the solution obtained from the weighted-sum equations. For instance, comparing $D_A(0.8, 0.2)$ and $D_B(0.7, b)$, we have $c_B < c_A$, so nondominance requires $e_B > e_A$, which means $b > 0.2$. The problem's structure ensures all constraints can be met simultaneously.\n5.  **No other flaws detected:** The problem is not trivial, circular, or based on unrealistic premises.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested by the problem statement. First, we determine the unknown parameter $b$ and the weight $w$. Second, we compute the hypervolume of the resulting set of nondominated designs.\n\n**Part 1: Determination of $b$ and $w$**\n\nWe are given three designs: $D_A = (c_A, e_A) = (0.8, 0.2)$, $D_B = (c_B, e_B) = (0.7, b)$, and $D_C = (c_C, e_C) = (0.9, 0.1)$. The objectives of cost and emissions are to be minimized.\n\nThe condition of mutual nondominance requires that for any pair of designs, one is not strictly better than the other on all objectives. Let us check this for the three pairs:\n-   $D_A$ vs $D_C$: $c_A < c_C$ (since $0.8 < 0.9$) and $e_A > e_C$ (since $0.2 > 0.1$). Neither dominates the other. This condition is met.\n-   $D_A$ vs $D_B$: $c_B < c_A$ (since $0.7 < 0.8$). For nondominance, we must have $e_B > e_A$, which implies $b > 0.2$.\n-   $D_B$ vs $D_C$: $c_B < c_C$ (since $0.7 < 0.9$). For nondominance, we must have $e_B > e_C$, which implies $b > 0.1$.\nThe union of these conditions is $b > 0.2$.\n\nNext, we apply the weighted-sum scalarization condition. The scalarized objective is $S(c, e) = wc + (1-w)e$. We are given that a single weight $w$ yields $S(D_A) = S(D_B) = S(D_C)$. This provides two independent equations.\n\nFirst, let's use the equality $S(D_A) = S(D_C)$ to find $w$:\n$$w c_A + (1-w) e_A = w c_C + (1-w) e_C$$\n$$w (0.8) + (1-w) (0.2) = w (0.9) + (1-w) (0.1)$$\n$$0.8w + 0.2 - 0.2w = 0.9w + 0.1 - 0.1w$$\n$$0.6w + 0.2 = 0.8w + 0.1$$\n$$0.1 = 0.2w$$\n$$w = \\frac{0.1}{0.2} = 0.5$$\nThis value is valid, as $w \\in [0,1]$.\n\nNow, we use the equality $S(D_A) = S(D_B)$ and the value $w=0.5$ to find $b$:\n$$w c_A + (1-w) e_A = w c_B + (1-w) e_B$$\n$$(0.5)(0.8) + (1-0.5)(0.2) = (0.5)(0.7) + (1-0.5)b$$\n$$0.4 + 0.1 = 0.35 + 0.5b$$\n$$0.5 = 0.35 + 0.5b$$\n$$0.15 = 0.5b$$\n$$b = \\frac{0.15}{0.5} = 0.3$$\nThis value $b=0.3$ satisfies the nondominance condition $b > 0.2$. Thus, the design specifications are fully determined.\n\nThe implication of mutual nondominance is that there is no single design that is objectively superior to the others. For example, $D_B$ has the lowest cost but highest emissions, while $D_C$ has the lowest emissions but highest cost. $D_A$ represents a compromise between them. A planner cannot rank these designs without introducing subjective preferences regarding the trade-off between cost and emissions. The weighted-sum method is one such preference model, where the weight $w$ quantifies the relative importance of cost versus emissions. A choice of $w=0.5$ indicates equal importance, and for this specific preference, all three designs are equally good.\n\n**Part 2: Hypervolume Indicator Calculation**\n\nWith $b=0.3$, the set of nondominated designs is $\\{D_A, D_B, D_C\\}$ with coordinates:\n-   $D_A = (0.8, 0.2)$\n-   $D_B = (0.7, 0.3)$\n-   $D_C = (0.9, 0.1)$\nThe reference point is $(r_c, r_e) = (1,1)$.\n\nThe hypervolume is the area of the union of the three rectangles defined by these points and the reference point. To compute this area without double-counting, we can use the slicing method. We first sort the points by their cost coordinate in increasing order:\n1.  $D_B = (0.7, 0.3)$\n2.  $D_A = (0.8, 0.2)$\n3.  $D_C = (0.9, 0.1)$\n\nThese points define vertical strips along the cost axis. The total hypervolume is the sum of the areas of the sub-regions within these strips.\n\n**Strip 1:** For the cost interval $[0.7, 0.8)$.\nThe width of this strip is $0.8 - 0.7 = 0.1$.\nWithin this strip, the portion of the hypervolume is defined by an effective lower bound on emissions. This bound is determined by the minimum emission value of all points with a cost coordinate less than or equal to $0.7$. The only such point is $D_B(0.7, 0.3)$.\nThe height of the rectangular slice is $r_e - e_B = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7$.\nArea of this slice: $A_1 = (0.8 - 0.7) \\times (1 - 0.3) = 0.1 \\times 0.7 = 0.07$.\n\n**Strip 2:** For the cost interval $[0.8, 0.9)$.\nThe width of this strip is $0.9 - 0.8 = 0.1$.\nThe effective lower bound on emissions is determined by the minimum emission value among all points with cost coordinate less than or equal to $0.8$, which are $D_B(0.7, 0.3)$ and $D_A(0.8, 0.2)$.\nThe minimum emission value is $\\min(0.3, 0.2) = 0.2$.\nThe height of the rectangular slice is $r_e - 0.2 = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8$.\nArea of this slice: $A_2 = (0.9 - 0.8) \\times (1 - 0.2) = 0.1 \\times 0.8 = 0.08$.\n\n**Strip 3:** For the cost interval $[0.9, 1.0]$.\nThe width of this strip is $1.0 - 0.9 = 0.1$.\nThe effective lower bound on emissions is determined by the minimum emission value among all points with cost coordinate less than or equal to $0.9$, which are $D_B(0.7, 0.3)$, $D_A(0.8, 0.2)$, and $D_C(0.9, 0.1)$.\nThe minimum emission value is $\\min(0.3, 0.2, 0.1) = 0.1$.\nThe height of the rectangular slice is $r_e - 0.1 = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9$.\nArea of this slice: $A_3 = (1.0 - 0.9) \\times (1 - 0.1) = 0.1 \\times 0.9 = 0.09$.\n\nThe total hypervolume indicator, $H$, is the sum of the areas of these non-overlapping rectangular slices:\n$$H = A_1 + A_2 + A_3 = 0.07 + 0.08 + 0.09 = 0.24$$",
