Suppose these proxies are modeled as the strictly convex functions $f_{1}(x)=x^{2}$ and $f_{2}(x)=(x-2)^{2}$. A standard approach to generating the Pareto frontier in multiobjective optimization is the weighted-sum scalarization: for a weight $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$, one minimizes the scalarized objective $g_{\\lambda}(x)=\\lambda f_{1}(x)+(1-\\lambda) f_{2}(x)$ over $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. \n\nStarting from the formal definition of Pareto optimality and properties of convex functions, derive the $\\lambda$-indexed minimizer $x^{\\star}(\\lambda)$ of $g_{\\lambda}(x)$, and use it to map the corresponding image in objective space $\\big(f_{1}(x^{\\star}(\\lambda)),f_{2}(x^{\\star}(\\lambda))\\big)$ as $\\lambda$ varies over $[0,1]$.

The concepts of Pareto optimality, convex functions, and the weighted-sum scalarization method are standard and fundamental in optimization theory and its applications, including energy systems modeling. The functions provided are simple, well-behaved convex polynomials. The problem is scientifically and mathematically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly defined with all necessary components. The objectives, decision variable domain, and optimization method are explicitly given. The functions are analytic and strictly convex, which guarantees the existence of a unique minimizer for the scalarized objective for any given $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$. The problem is well-posed.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using formal, precise mathematical language, free from ambiguity or subjective content.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains a complete and consistent setup for a standard multiobjective optimization exercise. Therefore, I will proceed with the solution.\n\nA solution $x^{\\star}$ is defined as Pareto optimal if there is no other feasible solution $x$ that dominates it. That is, there exists no $x$ such that $f_{i}(x) \\leq f_{i}(x^{\\star})$ for all objectives $i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$ and $f_{j}(x) < f_{j}(x^{\\star})$ for at least one objective $j \\in \\{1, 2\\}$. The set of all objective vectors corresponding to Pareto optimal solutions, i.e., $\\big(f_{1}(x^{\\star}), f_{2}(x^{\\star})\\big)$, constitutes the Pareto frontier.\n\nThe weighted-sum method combines the multiple objectives into a single scalar objective function, $g_{\\lambda}(x)$, which is then minimized. The scalarized objective is given by:\n$$g_{\\lambda}(x) = \\lambda f_{1}(x) + (1-\\lambda) f_{2}(x)$$\nSubstituting the given functions for $f_{1}(x)$ and $f_{2}(x)$:\n$$g_{\\lambda}(x) = \\lambda x^{2} + (1-\\lambda)(x-2)^{2}$$\nThe functions $f_{1}(x)=x^{2}$ and $f_{2}(x)=(x-2)^{2}$ are strictly convex. Since $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$, the function $g_{\\lambda}(x)$ is a non-negative linear combination of convex functions, and is therefore itself a convex function. For $\\lambda \\in (0,1)$, $g_{\\lambda}(x)$ is strictly convex. For a differentiable convex function defined over $\\mathbb{R}$, its global minimum occurs at any point $x$ where its first derivative is zero.\n\nWe calculate the derivative of $g_{\\lambda}(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$ \\frac{d g_{\\lambda}}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ \\lambda x^{2} + (1-\\lambda)(x-2)^{2} \\right] $$\n$$ \\frac{d g_{\\lambda}}{dx} = 2\\lambda x + 2(1-\\lambda)(x-2) $$\n$$ \\frac{d g_{\\lambda}}{dx} = 2\\lambda x + 2x - 4 - 2\\lambda x + 4\\lambda $$\n$$ \\frac{d g_{\\lambda}}{dx} = 2x - 4 + 4\\lambda $$\nTo find the minimizer $x^{\\star}(\\lambda)$, we set the derivative to zero:\n$$ 2x^{\\star}(\\lambda) - 4 + 4\\lambda = 0 $$\n$$ 2x^{\\star}(\\lambda) = 4 - 4\\lambda $$\n$$ x^{\\star}(\\lambda) = 2 - 2\\lambda = 2(1-\\lambda) $$\nThis expression for the minimizer is valid for all $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$. We can check the boundary cases:\n- For $\\lambda=1$, we minimize $g_{1}(x)=f_{1}(x)=x^{2}$, whose minimum is at $x=0$. Our formula gives $x^{\\star}(1) = 2(1-1) = 0$.\n- For $\\lambda=0$, we minimize $g_{0}(x)=f_{2}(x)=(x-2)^{2}$, whose minimum is at $x=2$. Our formula gives $x^{\\star}(0) = 2(1-0) = 2$.\nThe formula is therefore correct for the entire interval $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding point on the Pareto frontier in the objective space by substituting $x^{\\star}(\\lambda)$ back into the objective functions $f_{1}(x)$ and $f_{2}(x)$.\n\nFor the first objective, $f_{1}$:\n$$ f_{1}(x^{\\star}(\\lambda)) = (x^{\\star}(\\lambda))^{2} = \\big(2(1-\\lambda)\\big)^{2} = 4(1-\\lambda)^{2} $$\nFor the second objective, $f_{2}$:\n$$ f_{2}(x^{\\star}(\\lambda)) = (x^{\\star}(\\lambda)-2)^{2} = \\big(2(1-\\lambda) - 2\\big)^{2} = (2 - 2\\lambda - 2)^{2} = (-2\\lambda)^{2} = 4\\lambda^{2} $$\nThus, the Pareto optimal solutions in the decision space are given by $x^{\\star}(\\lambda)=2(1-\\lambda)$ and the corresponding points on the Pareto frontier are $\\big(4(1-\\lambda)^{2}, 4\\lambda^{2}\\big)$ for $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$.\n\nThe problem also requires justification for why the weighted-sum method recovers the entire Pareto frontier in this case. A fundamental theorem in multiobjective optimization states that for a convex optimization problem, the set of Pareto optimal solutions is identical to the set of solutions obtained by minimizing the weighted-sum scalarization $g_{\\lambda}(x)$ for all possible weight combinations where $\\lambda_i \\ge 0$ and $\\sum \\lambda_i = 1$.\nThis problem is a convex optimization problem because:\n1. The domain of the decision variable, $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, is a convex set.\n2. The objective functions, $f_{1}(x)=x^{2}$ and $f_{2}(x)=(x-2)^{2}$, are both convex functions (their second derivatives are $f_{1}''(x)=2 > 0$ and $f_{2}''(x)=2 > 0$).\nSince the problem is convex, every Pareto optimal point corresponds to the solution of a weighted-sum problem for some $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$. Therefore, by varying $\\lambda$ over its full range $[0,1]$, we are guaranteed to map out the entire Pareto frontier. The frontier itself is a convex curve in the objective space, as expected for a convex problem.\n\nThe final deliverable is the compact analytic expression for the row vector $\\big(x^{\\star}(\\lambda), f_{1}(x^{\\star}(\\lambda)), f_{2}(x^{\\star}(\\lambda))\\big)$. Based on our derivations:\n- $x^{\\star}(\\lambda) = 2(1-\\lambda)$\n- $f_{1}(x^{\\star}(\\lambda)) = 4(1-\\lambda)^{2}$\n- $f_{2}(x^{\\star}(\\lambda)) = 4\\lambda^{2}$\n\nThe resulting row vector is $\\begin{pmatrix} 2(1-\\lambda) & 4(1-\\lambda)^{2} & 4\\lambda^{2} \\end{pmatrix}$.",

There are no contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-defined mathematical exercise in the field of multi-objective optimization. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution process involves two main parts: first, identifying the subset of non-dominated designs, and second, calculating the hypervolume of this subset with respect to the given reference point.\n\n#### Part 1: Identification of the Non-dominated Subset\n\nIn a biobjective minimization problem, a point $P_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ is said to **dominate** another point $P_2 = (x_2, y_2)$, denoted $P_1 \\prec P_2$, if $x_1 \\le x_2$ and $y_1 \\le y_2$, with at least one inequality being strict (i.e., $(x_1, y_1) \\ne (x_2, y_2)$). A point is non-dominated if no other point in the set dominates it.\n\nThe set of candidate designs is $S = \\{A, B, C, D, E, F\\}$, with coordinates:\n-   $A = (60, 300)$\n-   $B = (80, 250)$\n-   $C = (90, 400)$\n-   $D = (70, 500)$\n-   $E = (55, 600)$\n-   $F = (65, 240)$\n\nWe perform pairwise comparisons to find dominated points:\n1.  Compare $A(60, 300)$ with others:\n    -   vs $C(90, 400)$: Since $60 < 90$ and $300 < 400$, $A$ dominates $C$. Point $C$ is dominated.\n    -   vs $D(70, 500)$: Since $60 < 70$ and $300 < 500$, $A$ dominates $D$. Point $D$ is dominated.\n2.  Compare $B(80, 250)$ with others not yet dominated (A, E, F):\n    -   vs $F(65, 240)$: Since $65 < 80$ and $240 < 250$, $F$ dominates $B$. Point $B$ is dominated.\n\nThe points found to be dominated are $B$, $C$, and $D$. The remaining points are checked for mutual non-dominance:\n-   $A = (60, 300)$\n-   $E = (55, 600)$\n-   $F = (65, 240)$\n\n-   $E$ vs $A$: $x_E < x_A$ ($55 < 60$), but $y_E > y_A$ ($600 > 300$). Neither dominates.\n-   $E$ vs $F$: $x_E < x_F$ ($55 < 65$), but $y_E > y_F$ ($600 > 240$). Neither dominates.\n-   $A$ vs $F$: $x_A < x_F$ ($60 < 65$), but $y_A > y_F$ ($300 > 240$). Neither dominates.\n\nThe points $A$, $E$, and $F$ are mutually non-dominating. Therefore, the non-dominated subset is $S_{ND} = \\{A, E, F\\}$.\n\n#### Part 2: Hypervolume Calculation\n\nThe hypervolume $HV$ is the area of the union of rectangles formed by each non-dominated point and the reference point $r = (120, 900)$. The non-dominated points are:\n-   $E = (55, 600)$\n-   $A = (60, 300)$\n-   $F = (65, 240)$\n\nTo simplify the calculation, we sort the non-dominated points by their first coordinate, $x$, in increasing order. This results in the sequence $E, A, F$:\n-   $p_1 = E = (x_1, y_1) = (55, 600)$\n-   $p_2 = A = (x_2, y_2) = (60, 300)$\n-   $p_3 = F = (x_3, y_3) = (65, 240)$\n\nNote that for a set of non-dominated points in a 2D minimization problem, sorting by one coordinate in increasing order results in the other coordinate being sorted in decreasing order ($x_1 < x_2 < x_3$ implies $y_1 > y_2 > y_3$). Here, $55 < 60 < 65$ and $600 > 300 > 240$, confirming their non-dominance.\n\nThe total area (hypervolume) is the integral of the upper envelope function defined by the reference point minus the lower envelope defined by the Pareto front, from the minimum $x$ value in the front to the reference $x$ value.\n$$ HV = \\int_{x_1}^{r_1} (r_2 - y_{\\text{front}}(x)) dx $$\nThe lower envelope $y_{\\text{front}}(x)$ is a step function determined by the sorted non-dominated points:\n$$ y_{\\text{front}}(x) = \\begin{cases} y_1 = 600 & \\text{if } 55 \\le x < 60 \\\\ y_2 = 300 & \\text{if } 60 \\le x < 65 \\\\ y_3 = 240 & \\text{if } 65 \\le x \\le 120 \\end{cases} $$\nThe integral can be decomposed into a sum of areas of disjoint rectangles:\n$$ HV = \\int_{55}^{60} (900 - 600) dx + \\int_{60}^{65} (900 - 300) dx + \\int_{65}^{120} (900 - 240) dx $$\nCalculating each term:\n-   Area 1: $(60 - 55) \\times (900 - 600) = 5 \\times 300 = 1500$\n-   Area 2: $(65 - 60) \\times (900 - 300) = 5 \\times 600 = 3000$\n-   Area 3: $(120 - 65) \\times (900 - 240) = 55 \\times 660 = 36300$\n\nThe total hypervolume is the sum of these areas:\n$$ HV = 1500 + 3000 + 36300 = 40800 $$\nThe units of this hypervolume are $(\\$/\\mathrm{MWh})\\cdot(\\mathrm{kg}\\ \\text{CO}_2/\\mathrm{MWh})$.\nThe problem asks for the result to be rounded to $4$ significant figures. The calculated value, $40800$, is exact. To unambiguously represent this value with 4 significant figures, we use scientific notation: $4.080 \\times 10^4$.",

The deterministic tie-breaking rule specifies that in case of a tie in the scalarized objective value, the solution with the smaller $f_2$ value is chosen, followed by the smaller $f_1$ value, and finally the smaller technology index $i$.\n\n**Test Case 1: Weighted-sum with $\\alpha = 0.2$**\nThe objective is to minimize $g_{0.2}(\\mathbf{x}) = 0.2 f_1(\\mathbf{x}) + (1-0.2) f_2(\\mathbf{x}) = 0.2 f_1(\\mathbf{x}) + 0.8 f_2(\\mathbf{x})$.\n-   Technology $1$: $g_{0.2} = 0.2(0) + 0.8(10) = 8.0$\n-   Technology $2$: $g_{0.2} = 0.2(5) + 0.8(6) = 1.0 + 4.8 = 5.8$\n-   Technology $3$: $g_{0.2} = 0.2(9) + 0.8(5) = 1.8 + 4.0 = 5.8$\n-   Technology $4$: $g_{0.2} = 0.2(10) + 0.8(0) = 2.0$\nThe minimum value is $2.0$, which corresponds to Technology $4$.\n\n**Test Case 2: Weighted-sum with $\\alpha = 0.6$**\nThe objective is to minimize $g_{0.6}(\\mathbf{x}) = 0.6 f_1(\\mathbf{x}) + 0.4 f_2(\\mathbf{x})$.\n-   Technology $1$: $g_{0.6} = 0.6(0) + 0.4(10) = 4.0$\n-   Technology $2$: $g_{0.6} = 0.6(5) + 0.4(6) = 3.0 + 2.4 = 5.4$\n-   Technology $3$: $g_{0.6} = 0.6(9) + 0.4(5) = 5.4 + 2.0 = 7.4$\n-   Technology $4$: $g_{0.6} = 0.6(10) + 0.4(0) = 6.0$\nThe minimum value is $4.0$, which corresponds to Technology $1$.\n\n**Test Case 3: Weighted-sum with $\\alpha = 0.9$**\nThe objective is to minimize $g_{0.9}(\\mathbf{x}) = 0.9 f_1(\\mathbf{x}) + 0.1 f_2(\\mathbf{x})$.\n-   Technology $1$: $g_{0.9} = 0.9(0) + 0.1(10) = 1.0$\n-   Technology $2$: $g_{0.9} = 0.9(5) + 0.1(6) = 4.5 + 0.6 = 5.1$\n-   Technology $3$: $g_{0.9} = 0.9(9) + 0.1(5) = 8.1 + 0.5 = 8.6$\n-   Technology $4$: $g_{0.9} = 0.9(10) + 0.1(0) = 9.0$\nThe minimum value is $1.0$, which corresponds to Technology $1$.\n\n**Test Case 4: Epsilon-constraint with $\\epsilon = 6$ kg $\\text{CO}_2\\text{e}$**\nThe objective is to minimize $f_1(\\mathbf{x})$ subject to $f_2(\\mathbf{x}) \\le 6$.\n-   Technology $1$: $f_2 = 10 > 6$ (infeasible).\n-   Technology $2$: $f_2 = 6 \\le 6$ (feasible). $f_1 = 5$.\n-   Technology $3$: $f_2 = 5 \\le 6$ (feasible). $f_1 = 9$.\n-   Technology $4$: $f_2 = 0 \\le 6$ (feasible). $f_1 = 10$.\nAmong the feasible solutions (Technologies $2$, $3$, $4$), the minimum $f_1$ is $5$, corresponding to Technology $2$.\n\n**Test Case 5: Epsilon-constraint with $\\epsilon = 5$ kg $\\text{CO}_2\\text{e}$**\nThe objective is to minimize $f_1(\\mathbf{x})$ subject to $f_2(\\mathbf{x}) \\le 5$.\n-   Technology $1$: $f_2 = 10 > 5$ (infeasible).\n-   Technology $2$: $f_2 = 6 > 5$ (infeasible).\n-   Technology $3$: $f_2 = 5 \\le 5$ (feasible). $f_1 = 9$.\n-   Technology $4$: $f_2 = 0 \\le 5$ (feasible). $f_1 = 10$.\nAmong the feasible solutions (Technologies $3$, $4$), the minimum $f_1$ is $9$, corresponding to Technology $3$. This demonstrates that the epsilon-constraint method can find unsupported Pareto points.\n\n**Test Case 6: Epsilon-constraint with $\\epsilon = 0$ kg $\\text{CO}_2\\text{e}$**\nThe objective is to minimize $f_1(\\mathbf{x})$ subject to $f_2(\\mathbf{x}) \\le 0$.\n-   Technology $1$: $f_2 = 10 > 0$ (infeasible).\n-   Technology $2$: $f_2 = 6 > 0$ (infeasible).\n-   Technology $3$: $f_2 = 5 > 0$ (infeasible).\n-   Technology $4$: $f_2 = 0 \\le 0$ (feasible). $f_1 = 10$.\nThe only feasible solution is Technology $4$.\n\n**Test Case 7: Augmented weighted Tchebycheff**\nThe objective is to minimize $h_{w,\\rho,z}(\\mathbf{x})$ with $\\mathbf{w} = (0.5, 0.5)$, $\\rho = 0.01$, and $\\mathbf{z} = (0,0)$.\n$h(\\mathbf{x}) = \\max\\{0.5 f_1(\\mathbf{x}), 0.5 f_2(\\mathbf{x})\\} + 0.01 (0.5 f_1(\\mathbf{x}) + 0.5 f_2(\\mathbf{x}))$.\nThis simplifies to $h(\\mathbf{x}) = 0.5 \\max\\{f_1(\\mathbf{x}), f_2(\\mathbf{x})\\} + 0.005 (f_1(\\mathbf{x}) + f_2(\\mathbf{x}))$.\n-   Technology $1$: $(f_1, f_2) = (0, 10)$. $h_1 = 0.5 \\max\\{0,10\\} + 0.005(0+10) = 0.5(10) + 0.05 = 5.05$.\n-   Technology $2$: $(f_1, f_2) = (5, 6)$. $h_2 = 0.5 \\max\\{5,6\\} + 0.005(5+6) = 0.5(6) + 0.055 = 3.055$.\n-   Technology $3$: $(f_1, f_2) = (9, 5)$. $h_3 = 0.5 \\max\\{9,5\\} + 0.005(9+5) = 0.5(9) + 0.07 = 4.57$.\n-   Technology $4$: $(f_1, f_2) = (10, 0)$. $h_4 = 0.5 \\max\\{10,0\\} + 0.005(10+0) = 0.5(10) + 0.05 = 5.05$.\nThe minimum value is $3.055$, which corresponds to Technology $2$.\n\nThe final results are the technology indices for each of the $7$ cases in order: $[4, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2]$.",
