Round the final numeric answer to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the economic principles of price indexing and deflation, which are standard practices in energy systems modeling. The provided data and definitions are self-contained and consistent. The task is well-posed, with a clear objective and sufficient information to arrive at a unique solution. The given index values are plausible representations of inflation. The problem does not violate any fundamental principles, is not based on false premises, and uses precise, objective language. The presence of extra information ($I^{\\mathrm{CPI}}$ values and $p^{\\mathrm{real}(\\mathrm{CPI},2012)}_{2018}$) does not create a contradiction for the specified task, as the task explicitly directs which input data to use ($p^{\\mathrm{nom}}_{2030}$ and GDP deflator series). The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe core relationship between a nominal price $p^{\\mathrm{nom}}_{t}$ in year $t$ and its corresponding real price $p^{\\mathrm{real}(X,b)}_{t}$ in terms of a base year $b$ using a price index series $X$ is given by the definition of price deflation. The real price is the nominal price adjusted for changes in the price level between year $t$ and base year $b$. The formula is:\n$$ p^{\\mathrm{real}(X,b)}_{t} = p^{\\mathrm{nom}}_{t} \\times \\frac{I^{X}_{b}}{I^{X}_{t}} $$\nHere, $I^{X}_{t}$ is the value of the price index of family $X$ in year $t$, and $I^{X}_{b}$ is its value in the base year $b$. The ratio $\\frac{I^{X}_{b}}{I^{X}_{t}}$ serves as the deflation factor.\n\nThe problem first asks for a general index transformation. This would be a formula to convert a price from one real basis (index $X_1$, base year $b_1$) to another (index $X_2$, base year $b_2$). We can derive this by first converting the initial real price back to its nominal value and then converting that nominal value to the new real basis.\n\nFrom the definition, we can express the nominal price as:\n$$ p^{\\mathrm{nom}}_{t} = p^{\\mathrm{real}(X_1,b_1)}_{t} \\times \\frac{I^{X_1}_{t}}{I^{X_1}_{b_1}} $$\nNow, we can find the new real price $p^{\\mathrm{real}(X_2,b_2)}_{t}$ by substituting this expression for $p^{\\mathrm{nom}}_{t}$ into the general definition:\n$$ p^{\\mathrm{real}(X_2,b_2)}_{t} = p^{\\mathrm{nom}}_{t} \\times \\frac{I^{X_2}_{b_2}}{I^{X_2}_{t}} = \\left( p^{\\mathrm{real}(X_1,b_1)}_{t} \\times \\frac{I^{X_1}_{t}}{I^{X_1}_{b_1}} \\right) \\times \\frac{I^{X_2}_{b_2}}{I^{X_2}_{t}} $$\nThis provides the general transformation framework.\n\nHowever, for the specific task at hand, the starting point is a nominal price, not a real price in a different basis. We are asked to compute the price of electricity in year $t=2030$ in real dollars of base year $b=2018$, using the GDP deflator as the index family $X=\\mathrm{GDP}$. The required quantity is $p^{\\mathrm{real}(\\mathrm{GDP},2018)}_{2030}$.\n\nWe are given the nominal price in year $2030$:\n$$ p^{\\mathrm{nom}}_{2030} = 92 $$\nThe required transformation is a direct application of the fundamental deflation formula with $t=2030$, $b=2018$, and $X=\\mathrm{GDP}$:\n$$ p^{\\mathrm{real}(\\mathrm{GDP},2018)}_{2030} = p^{\\mathrm{nom}}_{2030} \\times \\frac{I^{\\mathrm{GDP}}_{2018}}{I^{\\mathrm{GDP}}_{2030}} $$\nFrom the given data, we have the necessary GDP deflator values:\n$$ I^{\\mathrm{GDP}}_{2018} = 100 $$\n$$ I^{\\mathrm{GDP}}_{2030} = 128 $$\nSubstituting the numerical values into the equation:\n$$ p^{\\mathrm{real}(\\mathrm{GDP},2018)}_{2030} = 92 \\times \\frac{100}{128} $$\nNow, we perform the calculation:\n$$ p^{\\mathrm{real}(\\mathrm{GDP},2018)}_{2030} = \\frac{9200}{128} $$\nTo simplify the fraction, we can divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor. Let's simplify in steps:\n$$ \\frac{9200 \\div 4}{128 \\div 4} = \\frac{2300}{32} $$\n$$ \\frac{2300 \\div 4}{32 \\div 4} = \\frac{575}{8} $$\nConverting the fraction to a decimal value:\n$$ p^{\\mathrm{real}(\\mathrm{GDP},2018)}_{2030} = 71.875 $$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The number $71.875$ has five significant figures. Rounding to four significant figures, we examine the fifth digit (which is $5$) and round the fourth digit up.\n$$ p^{\\mathrm{real}(\\mathrm{GDP},2018)}_{2030} \\approx 71.88 $$\nThe extraneous information, including the CPI series and the real price $p^{\\mathrm{real}(\\mathrm{CPI},2012)}_{2018} = 68$, was not needed to solve the problem as stated, which required starting from the nominal price $p^{\\mathrm{nom}}_{2030}$ and using the GDP deflator.",

This practice moves into the mechanics of coupling by focusing on the principle of energy conservation, requiring that energy demand from one model is met by supply from another.

            "problem": "Two independently developed energy systems models are soft-linked over a common planning horizon consisting of four periods indexed by $t \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. The first model is a demand-side simulation that outputs total final energy demand $D_{t}$ by aggregating end-use service demands across sectors. The second model is a supply expansion optimization that outputs total final energy delivered to end users $S_{t}$ after accounting for conversion and network losses. The foundational principle of energy conservation requires that, at the system boundary of final energy delivery, aggregate final demand equals aggregate final supply. Formally, if $D_{\\text{tot}} = \\sum_{t=1}^{4} D_{t}$ and $S_{\\text{tot}} = \\sum_{t=1}^{4} S_{t}$, then the energy balance condition is $D_{\\text{tot}} = S_{\\text{tot}}$.\n\nBecause the two models differ in structure and resolution, the soft-linking design allows a tolerance band so that the energy balance condition need not hold exactly but must be within a specified tolerance. Let the tolerance be $\\epsilon > 0$ in units of terawatt-hours and define the total mismatch $\\,\\Delta = D_{\\text{tot}} - S_{\\text{tot}}\\,$. You are asked to:\n\n- Derive, from the energy conservation principle, a linking constraint that enforces equality of $D_{\\text{tot}}$ and $S_{\\text{tot}}$ within tolerance $\\epsilon$.\n- Propose a convex penalty function $\\phi(\\Delta)$ to be added to the supply model’s objective so that violations outside the tolerance band are penalized, but no penalty is applied inside the band. The penalty must be nonnegative, even in $\\Delta$ (i.e., depend only on $|\\Delta|$), and differentiable almost everywhere. Use a single scalar penalty weight $\\alpha > 0$ with units of dollars per square terawatt-hour.\n- Using the proposed penalty function, compute the penalty contribution for the following consistent and plausible scenario. The demand model outputs\n$$\nD_{1} = 120\\ \\text{TWh},\\quad D_{2} = 135\\ \\text{TWh},\\quad D_{3} = 150\\ \\text{TWh},\\quad D_{4} = 165\\ \\text{TWh},\n$$\nwhile the supply model outputs\n$$\nS_{1} = 118\\ \\text{TWh},\\quad S_{2} = 132\\ \\text{TWh},\\quad S_{3} = 148\\ \\text{TWh},\\quad S_{4} = 151\\ \\text{TWh}.\n$$\nLet the tolerance be $\\epsilon = 10\\ \\text{TWh}$ and the penalty weight be $\\alpha = 1.5 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\text{\\$}/\\text{TWh}^{2}$.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on the fundamental principle of energy conservation and employs standard techniques from the field of energy systems modeling, namely the soft-linking of models via a tolerance band and a penalty function. All data, definitions, and constraints are provided, are internally consistent, and are physically plausible. The units are dimensionally correct. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part answer: the derivation of a linking constraint, the proposal of a suitable penalty function, and the computation of the penalty for a given scenario.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Linking Constraint**\n\nThe problem asks for a linking constraint that enforces the equality of total final demand, $D_{\\text{tot}}$, and total final supply, $S_{\\text{tot}}$, within a specified tolerance $\\epsilon > 0$. The total mismatch is defined as $\\Delta = D_{\\text{tot}} - S_{\\text{tot}}$.\n\nThe condition that the equality holds \"within tolerance $\\epsilon$\" is a statement about the magnitude of the mismatch. It requires that the absolute value of the mismatch, $|\\Delta|$, must not exceed the tolerance $\\epsilon$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\n|\\Delta| \\le \\epsilon\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of $\\Delta$, we get:\n$$\n|D_{\\text{tot}} - S_{\\text{tot}}| \\le \\epsilon\n$$\nThis absolute value inequality is equivalent to a pair of linear inequalities, which represents the linking constraint:\n$$\n-\\epsilon \\le D_{\\text{tot}} - S_{\\text{tot}} \\le \\epsilon\n$$\nThis constraint ensures that the total supply can deviate from the total demand by at most $\\epsilon$ in either direction over the entire planning horizon.\n\n**Part 2: Proposal of a Convex Penalty Function**\n\nThe problem requires a penalty function $\\phi(\\Delta)$ to be added to the supply model's objective function. This function must satisfy several properties:\n1.  It must be convex.\n2.  It must be non-negative, $\\phi(\\Delta) \\ge 0$.\n3.  It must be an even function of $\\Delta$, depending only on $|\\Delta|$.\n4.  It must be differentiable almost everywhere.\n5.  It must apply no penalty within the tolerance band, i.e., $\\phi(\\Delta) = 0$ for $|\\Delta| \\le \\epsilon$.\n6.  It must penalize violations outside the band, i.e., $\\phi(\\Delta) > 0$ for $|\\Delta| > \\epsilon$.\n7.  It must use a penalty weight $\\alpha > 0$ with units of dollars per square terawatt-hour.\n\nThe units of $\\alpha$ ($\\$/\\text{TWh}^{2}$) suggest that the penalty should be quadratic in the magnitude of the violation, which has units of terawatt-hours (TWh). The magnitude of the violation is the amount by which $|\\Delta|$ exceeds $\\epsilon$, which is $(|\\Delta| - \\epsilon)$ for $|\\Delta| > \\epsilon$.\n\nA suitable function that meets all these criteria is a quadratic penalty on the violation. We can define the function as:\n$$\n\\phi(\\Delta) = \\begin{cases}\n0 & \\text{if } |\\Delta| \\le \\epsilon \\\\\n\\alpha (|\\Delta| - \\epsilon)^2 & \\text{if } |\\Delta| > \\epsilon\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis can be written more compactly using the maximum function:\n$$\n\\phi(\\Delta) = \\alpha \\left( \\max(0, |\\Delta| - \\epsilon) \\right)^2\n$$\nLet us verify that this function satisfies the required properties:\n-   **Convexity**: The function $x \\mapsto |\\Delta|$ is convex. The function $y \\mapsto \\max(0, y - \\epsilon)$ is convex and non-decreasing. The function $z \\mapsto \\alpha z^2$ (for $z \\ge 0$) is convex and non-decreasing. The composition of convex, non-decreasing functions preserves convexity. Therefore, $\\phi(\\Delta)$ is a convex function.\n-   **Non-negativity**: Since $\\alpha > 0$ and the squared term is always non-negative, $\\phi(\\Delta) \\ge 0$ for all $\\Delta$.\n-   **Even Function**: The function depends on $|\\Delta|$, so $\\phi(\\Delta) = \\phi(-\\Delta)$, satisfying the condition.\n-   **Differentiability**: The function is continuously differentiable (class $C^1$) everywhere. The only points of concern are $|\\Delta| = \\epsilon$. The derivative is $0$ for $|\\Delta| < \\epsilon$. For $\\Delta > \\epsilon$, the derivative is $2\\alpha(\\Delta - \\epsilon)$, which approaches $0$ as $\\Delta \\to \\epsilon^{+}$. For $\\Delta < -\\epsilon$, the function is $\\alpha(-\\Delta - \\epsilon)^2$, and the derivative is $2\\alpha(-\\Delta-\\epsilon)(-1) = 2\\alpha(\\Delta+\\epsilon)$, which approaches $0$ as $\\Delta \\to (-\\epsilon)^{-}$. Since the derivative is continuous and equal to $0$ at the boundaries $|\\Delta|=\\epsilon$, the function is differentiable everywhere. It is therefore differentiable \"almost everywhere\".\n-   **No Penalty Inside Band**: By its definition, if $|\\Delta| \\le \\epsilon$, then $|\\Delta|-\\epsilon \\le 0$, so $\\max(0, |\\Delta|-\\epsilon) = 0$, and $\\phi(\\Delta) = 0$.\n-   **Penalty Outside Band**: If $|\\Delta| > \\epsilon$, then $|\\Delta|-\\epsilon > 0$ and $\\alpha > 0$, so $\\phi(\\Delta) = \\alpha(|\\Delta|-\\epsilon)^2 > 0$.\n-   **Units**: The term $(|\\Delta|-\\epsilon)$ has units of TWh, so $(|\\Delta|-\\epsilon)^2$ has units of $\\text{TWh}^2$. The parameter $\\alpha$ has units of $\\$/\\text{TWh}^2$. The product, $\\phi(\\Delta)$, correctly has units of dollars.\n\nThe proposed function $\\phi(\\Delta) = \\alpha \\left( \\max(0, |\\Delta| - \\epsilon) \\right)^2$ is a standard and appropriate choice.\n\n**Part 3: Computation of the Penalty Contribution**\n\nFirst, we compute the total final energy demand, $D_{\\text{tot}}$, and the total final energy supply, $S_{\\text{tot}}$, using the provided data.\nThe demand values are $D_{1} = 120$, $D_{2} = 135$, $D_{3} = 150$, and $D_{4} = 165$, all in TWh.\n$$\nD_{\\text{tot}} = \\sum_{t=1}^{4} D_{t} = 120 + 135 + 150 + 165 = 570\\ \\text{TWh}\n$$\nThe supply values are $S_{1} = 118$, $S_{2} = 132$, $S_{3} = 148$, and $S_{4} = 151$, all in TWh.\n$$\nS_{\\text{tot}} = \\sum_{t=1}^{4} S_{t} = 118 + 132 + 148 + 151 = 549\\ \\text{TWh}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the total mismatch, $\\Delta$:\n$$\n\\Delta = D_{\\text{tot}} - S_{\\text{tot}} = 570 - 549 = 21\\ \\text{TWh}\n$$\nThe absolute value of the mismatch is $|\\Delta| = 21\\ \\text{TWh}$.\nThe specified tolerance is $\\epsilon = 10\\ \\text{TWh}$.\n\nWe compare the absolute mismatch to the tolerance:\n$$\n|\\Delta| = 21\\ \\text{TWh} > \\epsilon = 10\\ \\text{TWh}\n$$\nSince the mismatch is outside the tolerance band, a penalty is incurred. We use the penalty function derived in Part 2 with the given penalty weight $\\alpha = 1.5 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\$/\\text{TWh}^{2}$.\n\nThe penalty, which we will denote as $P$, is calculated as:\n$$\nP = \\phi(\\Delta) = \\alpha (|\\Delta| - \\epsilon)^2\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\nP = (1.5 \\times 10^{7})\\ \\frac{\\$}{\\text{TWh}^2} \\times (21\\ \\text{TWh} - 10\\ \\text{TWh})^2\n$$\n$$\nP = (1.5 \\times 10^{7}) \\times (11)^2\\ \\$\n$$\n$$\nP = (1.5 \\times 10^{7}) \\times 121\\ \\$\n$$\n$$\nP = 181.5 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\$ = 1.815 \\times 10^{9}\\ \\$\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

The dispatch module minimizes total cost subject to nonconvex operating constraints for a baseload technology and a peaking technology:\n\n- Baseload technology $A$: variable cost $c_A = 30$ $\\$/\\mathrm{MWh}$, startup cost $S_A = 5000$ $\\$$ (incurred if the unit is on), minimum stable output $m_A = 100$ $\\mathrm{MW}$, and maximum output $M_A = 400$ $\\mathrm{MW}$.\n- Peaking technology $B$: variable cost $c_B = 70$ $\\$/\\mathrm{MWh}$, no startup cost, and no binding capacity limit.\n\nThe dispatch module serves the quantity $Q$ at minimum total cost given $p$ by choosing whether to start $A$ and, if started, producing at least $m_A$ and at most $M_A$, with any residual served by $B$. The market-clearing price reported back to the demand module equals the marginal cost of the last $\\mathrm{MWh}$ served under the dispatch solution. Specifically: if only $B$ serves demand, the reported price is $c_B$; if $A$ alone serves demand within its operating range, the reported price is $c_A$; if $A$ and $B$ both serve, the reported price is $c_B$. The dispatch module will start $A$ only if $Q \\ge m_A$ and the variable cost savings relative to using only $B$ weakly exceed the startup cost; that is, if $S_A + c_A Q \\le c_B Q$.\n\nA soft-link iteration is defined by the mapping $p^{(k)} \\mapsto p^{(k+1)}$ where, for iteration $k$, the demand module computes $Q^{(k)} = \\alpha - \\beta p^{(k)}$ and the dispatch module computes a least-cost supply plan for $Q^{(k)}$, returning $p^{(k+1)}$ equal to the marginal cost implied by that plan.\n\nTasks:\n1.

            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of a soft-linking iterative process between an electricity demand module and a supply-side dispatch module. We must first demonstrate the existence of multiple equilibrium prices (fixed points) and then determine the specific equilibrium to which the process converges from a given starting price.\n\nThe aggregate electricity demand $Q$ in $\\mathrm{MW}$ is a function of the price $p$ in $\\$/\\mathrm{MWh}$, given by the linear inverse demand function:\n$$Q(p) = \\alpha - \\beta p$$\nwith given parameters $\\alpha = 220$ and $\\beta = 2$.\n\nThe dispatch module minimizes the total cost of supplying the quantity $Q$ using two technologies:\n- Technology A (baseload): variable cost $c_A = 30$ $\\$/\\mathrm{MWh}$, startup cost $S_A = 5000$ $\\$$, minimum output $m_A = 100$ $\\mathrm{MW}$, and maximum output $M_A = 400$ $\\mathrm{MW}$.\n- Technology B (peaking): variable cost $c_B = 70$ $\\$/\\mathrm{MWh}$, with no startup cost or capacity limit.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the decision logic of the dispatch module. First, we determine the condition under which the baseload technology A is committed (i.e., started). According to the problem statement, technology A is started if and only if two conditions are met:\n1. The demand is sufficient to meet the minimum stable output: $Q \\ge m_A$.\n2. The total cost of generation with A committed is less than or equal to the cost of meeting the entire demand with technology B. The cost of generating a quantity $Q$ using only technology B is $c_B Q$. The cost when technology A is started to help meet demand is $S_A + c_A Q$ (assuming A can satisfy the whole demand, which is the basis for the commitment decision). This condition is stated as $S_A + c_A Q \\le c_B Q$.\n\nLet's analyze the second condition by substituting the given values:\n$S_A \\le (c_B - c_A) Q$\n$5000 \\le (70 - 30) Q$\n$5000 \\le 40 Q$\n$$Q \\ge \\frac{5000}{40} = 125 \\, \\mathrm{MW}$$\nThe first condition is $Q \\ge m_A = 100 \\, \\mathrm{MW}$. Since $125 \\, \\mathrm{MW} > 100 \\, \\mathrm{MW}$, the condition $Q \\ge 125$ is stricter and implies $Q \\ge 100$. Therefore, technology A is committed if and only if $Q \\ge 125 \\, \\mathrm{MW}$. This nonconvexity (an all-or-nothing decision with a startup cost) is the source of the complex behavior.\n\nNow, we define the iterative map $p^{(k+1)} = G(p^{(k)})$. At each iteration $k$, given a price $p^{(k)}$, the demand is $Q^{(k)} = \\alpha - \\beta p^{(k)} = 220 - 2p^{(k)}$. The dispatch module then determines the least-cost supply plan and reports the marginal cost as the next price, $p^{(k+1)}$.\n\nWe can define the function $G(p)$ by considering two cases based on the commitment threshold $Q = 125 \\, \\mathrm{MW}$.\nFirst, let's find the price $p$ that corresponds to this threshold quantity:\n$125 = 220 - 2p \\implies 2p = 220 - 125 = 95 \\implies p = 47.5 \\, \\$/\\mathrm{MWh}$.\n\nCase 1: $Q < 125 \\, \\mathrm{MW}$ (which corresponds to $p > 47.5 \\, \\$/\\mathrm{MWh}$)\nIn this case, technology A is not committed. The entire demand $Q$ must be served by technology B. The marginal cost is the variable cost of technology B.\nThus, for $p > 47.5$, the next price is $p^{(k+1)} = c_B = 70$.\n\nCase 2: $Q \\ge 125 \\, \\mathrm{MW}$ (which corresponds to $p \\le 47.5 \\, \\$/\\mathrm{MWh}$)\nIn this case, technology A is committed. The dispatch will use the cheaper technology A as much as possible, up to its maximum capacity $M_A = 400 \\, \\mathrm{MW}$.\nThe demand is $Q(p) = 220 - 2p$. For $p \\ge 0$, the maximum possible demand is $Q(0) = 220 \\, \\mathrm{MW}$.\nSince the demand in this regime ($p \\le 47.5$) satisfies $125 \\le Q \\le 220$, and this range is entirely within technology A's operating limits ($m_A = 100 \\le Q \\le M_A = 400$), technology A can meet the entire demand alone.\nThe dispatch will be $q_A = Q$ and $q_B = 0$. The marginal unit is technology A.\nThus, for $p \\le 47.5$, the next price is $p^{(k+1)} = c_A = 30$.\n\nCombining these cases, the iterative mapping function $p' = G(p)$ is a piecewise constant function:\n$$G(p) = \\begin{cases} 30 & \\text{if } p \\le 47.5 \\\\ 70 & \\text{if } p > 47.5 \\end{cases}$$\n\n**Task 1: Demonstrate the existence of multiple fixed points**\nA fixed point $p^{\\star}$ of the mapping is a price such that $p^{\\star} = G(p^{\\star})$. We search for fixed points in each piece of the function's domain.\n\n- Assume $p^{\\star} \\le 47.5$. The fixed-point equation is $p^{\\star} = G(p^{\\star}) = 30$. The value $p^{\\star} = 30$ is consistent with the assumption $30 \\le 47.5$. Thus, $p_1^{\\star} = 30 \\, \\$/\\mathrm{MWh}$ is a fixed point.\nLet's verify: If $p=30$, $Q = 220 - 2(30) = 160$. Since $160 \\ge 125$, A is committed. Since $100 \\le 160 \\le 400$, A serves all demand. Marginal cost is $c_A=30$. The next price is $30$.\n\n- Assume $p^{\\star} > 47.5$. The fixed-point equation is $p^{\\star} = G(p^{\\star}) = 70$. The value $p^{\\star} = 70$ is consistent with the assumption $70 > 47.5$. Thus, $p_2^{\\star} = 70 \\, \\$/\\mathrm{MWh}$ is a fixed point.\nLet's verify: If $p=70$, $Q = 220 - 2(70) = 80$. Since $80 < 125$, A is not committed. B serves all demand. Marginal cost is $c_B=70$. The next price is $70$.\n\nWe have successfully found two distinct fixed points, $p_1^{\\star} = 30$ and $p_2^{\\star} = 70$. This demonstrates that multiple equilibria can exist due to the nonconvex operating constraint (the startup cost) of technology A.\n\n**Task 2: Compute the equilibrium price for an initial price of $p^{(0)} = 75$**\nWe now apply the iterative mapping $p^{(k+1)} = G(p^{(k)})$ starting with $p^{(0)} = 75 \\, \\$/\\mathrm{MWh}$.\n\n- Iteration $k=0$:\nThe initial price is $p^{(0)} = 75$.\nSince $p^{(0)} = 75 > 47.5$, we are in the upper branch of the mapping function.\nThe next price is $p^{(1)} = G(75) = 70$.\n\n- Iteration $k=1$:\nThe current price is $p^{(1)} = 70$.\nSince $p^{(1)} = 70 > 47.5$, we are again in the upper branch of the mapping function.\nThe next price is $p^{(2)} = G(70) = 70$.\n\nSince $p^{(2)} = p^{(1)} = 70$, the iteration has converged. For all subsequent iterations $k \\ge 1$, we will have $p^{(k)} = 70$. The equilibrium price to which the iteration converges is $p^{\\star} = 70 \\, \\$/\\mathrm{MWh}$.\nThe sequence of prices is $75, 70, 70, 70, \\dots$.\nThe convergent equilibrium price is $70 \\, \\$/\\mathrm{MWh}$.",
