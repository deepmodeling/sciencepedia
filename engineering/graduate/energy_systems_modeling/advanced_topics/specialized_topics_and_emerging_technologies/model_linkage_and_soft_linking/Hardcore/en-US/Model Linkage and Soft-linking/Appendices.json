The power system optimization model, denoted as $M_{\\mathrm{P}}$, internally calibrates and reports some outputs in real prices using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) normalized to base year $2012$ (so $I^{\\mathrm{CPI}}_{2012} = 100$), but for external reporting it also provides nominal outputs for each simulation year. The macroeconomic model, denoted as $M_{\\mathrm{E}}$, ingests input prices in real dollars using the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) deflator normalized to base year $2018$ (so $I^{\\mathrm{GDP}}_{2018} = 100$). To ensure soft-link consistency, the nominal versus real price concepts must be aligned across the two models despite different indices and base years.\n\nYou are given the following scientifically plausible index values:\n- CPI series (normalized to $2012$ as $100$): $I^{\\mathrm{CPI}}_{2012} = 100$, $I^{\\mathrm{CPI}}_{2018} = 113$, $I^{\\mathrm{CPI}}_{2030} = 142$.\n- GDP deflator series (normalized to $2018$ as $100$): $I^{\\mathrm{GDP}}_{2012} = 95$, $I^{\\mathrm{GDP}}_{2018} = 100$, $I^{\\mathrm{GDP}}_{2030} = 128$.\n\nDefinitions:\n- A nominal price $p^{\\mathrm{nom}}_{t}$ is the monetary value at time $t$ measured in current dollars of year $t$.\n- A real price $p^{\\mathrm{real}(X,b)}_{t}$ is the nominal price deflated to a base year $b$ using index family $X$ (for example, CPI or GDP deflator).\n\nData from the models:\n- $M_{\\mathrm{P}}$ reports a nominal wholesale electricity price of $p^{\\mathrm{nom}}_{2030} = 92$ in year $2030$ (in dollars per megawatt-hour).\n- $M_{\\mathrm{P}}$ also reports, for year $2018$, a real price expressed in CPI-$2012$ dollars of $p^{\\mathrm{real}(\\mathrm{CPI},2012)}_{2018} = 68$.\n\nTask:\nStarting only from the core definitions above and the provided indices, derive the general index transformation needed to align nominal versus real prices across models with different base years and indices.

            "solution": "### Solution Derivation\nThe core relationship between a nominal price $p^{\\mathrm{nom}}_{t}$ in year $t$ and its corresponding real price $p^{\\mathrm{real}(X,b)}_{t}$ in terms of a base year $b$ using a price index series $X$ is given by the definition of price deflation. The real price is the nominal price adjusted for changes in the price level between year $t$ and base year $b$. The formula is:\n$$ p^{\\mathrm{real}(X,b)}_{t} = p^{\\mathrm{nom}}_{t} \\times \\frac{I^{X}_{b}}{I^{X}_{t}} $$\nHere, $I^{X}_{t}$ is the value of the price index of family $X$ in year $t$, and $I^{X}_{b}$ is its value in the base year $b$. The ratio $\\frac{I^{X}_{b}}{I^{X}_{t}}$ serves as the deflation factor.\n\nThe problem first asks for a general index transformation. This would be a formula to convert a price from one real basis (index $X_1$, base year $b_1$) to another (index $X_2$, base year $b_2$). We can derive this by first converting the initial real price back to its nominal value and then converting that nominal value to the new real basis.\n\nFrom the definition, we can express the nominal price as:\n$$ p^{\\mathrm{nom}}_{t} = p^{\\mathrm{real}(X_1,b_1)}_{t} \\times \\frac{I^{X_1}_{t}}{I^{X_1}_{b_1}} $$\nNow, we can find the new real price $p^{\\mathrm{real}(X_2,b_2)}_{t}$ by substituting this expression for $p^{\\mathrm{nom}}_{t}$ into the general definition:\n$$ p^{\\mathrm{real}(X_2,b_2)}_{t} = p^{\\mathrm{nom}}_{t} \\times \\frac{I^{X_2}_{b_2}}{I^{X_2}_{t}} = \\left( p^{\\mathrm{real}(X_1,b_1)}_{t} \\times \\frac{I^{X_1}_{t}}{I^{X_1}_{b_1}} \\right) \\times \\frac{I^{X_2}_{b_2}}{I^{X_2}_{t}} $$\nThis provides the general transformation framework.\n\nHowever, for the specific task at hand, the starting point is a nominal price, not a real price in a different basis. We are asked to compute the price of electricity in year $t=2030$ in real dollars of base year $b=2018$, using the GDP deflator as the index family $X=\\mathrm{GDP}$. The required quantity is $p^{\\mathrm{real}(\\mathrm{GDP},2018)}_{2030}$.\n\nWe are given the nominal price in year $2030$:\n$$ p^{\\mathrm{nom}}_{2030} = 92 $$\nThe required transformation is a direct application of the fundamental deflation formula with $t=2030$, $b=2018$, and $X=\\mathrm{GDP}$:\n$$ p^{\\mathrm{real}(\\mathrm{GDP},2018)}_{2030} = p^{\\mathrm{nom}}_{2030} \\times \\frac{I^{\\mathrm{GDP}}_{2018}}{I^{\\mathrm{GDP}}_{2030}} $$\nFrom the given data, we have the necessary GDP deflator values:\n$$ I^{\\mathrm{GDP}}_{2018} = 100 $$\n$$ I^{\\mathrm{GDP}}_{2030} = 128 $$\nSubstituting the numerical values into the equation:\n$$ p^{\\mathrm{real}(\\mathrm{GDP},2018)}_{2030} = 92 \\times \\frac{100}{128} $$\nNow, we perform the calculation:\n$$ p^{\\mathrm{real}(\\mathrm{GDP},2018)}_{2030} = \\frac{9200}{128} $$\nTo simplify the fraction, we can divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor. Let's simplify in steps:\n$$ \\frac{9200 \\div 4}{128 \\div 4} = \\frac{2300}{32} $$\n$$ \\frac{2300 \\div 4}{32 \\div 4} = \\frac{575}{8} $$\nConverting the fraction to a decimal value:\n$$ p^{\\mathrm{real}(\\mathrm{GDP},2018)}_{2030} = 71.875 $$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The number $71.875$ has five significant figures. Rounding to four significant figures, we examine the fifth digit (which is $5$) and round the fourth digit up.\n$$ p^{\\mathrm{real}(\\mathrm{GDP},2018)}_{2030} \\approx 71.88 $$\nThe extraneous information, including the CPI series and the real price $p^{\\mathrm{real}(\\mathrm{CPI},2012)}_{2018} = 68$, was not needed to solve the problem as stated, which required starting from the nominal price $p^{\\mathrm{nom}}_{2030}$ and using the GDP deflator.",

The upstream model reports net flows, while the downstream model requires gross flows to compute transmission losses and enforce conservation of mass. Consider regions $A$ and $B$ and a single energy commodity measured in terajoules (TJ) over one time period. Let $E_{AB}$ denote the gross energy dispatched from region $A$ to region $B$, and $E_{BA}$ denote the gross energy dispatched from region $B$ to region $A$. Transmission incurs proportional losses: the loss on any dispatched flow is $L = \\eta E$, where $0  \\eta  1$ is a constant loss rate. Energy delivered from $A$ to $B$ is $(1 - \\eta) E_{AB}$, and energy delivered from $B$ to $A$ is $(1 - \\eta) E_{BA}$.\n\nThe downstream model enforces the mass-conservation identity at the regional level with an explicit losses term:\n$$\nS_{i} + \\text{inflows}_{i} = D_{i} + \\text{outflows}_{i} + L_{i},\n$$\nfor $i \\in \\{A,B\\}$, where $S_{i}$ is the regional supply, $D_{i}$ is the regional demand, and $L_{i}$ is the regional allocation of transmission losses.

            "solution": "### Solution Derivation\nFirst, we establish the correct energy balance for each region using the true gross flows, which provides the necessary definitions for the regional supplies $S_A$ and $S_B$. The energy balance for region $i$ is given by $S_{i} + \\text{inflows}_{i} = D_{i} + \\text{outflows}_{i} + L_{i}$.\n\nFor region $A$:\n- Outflow is the gross dispatch: $\\text{outflows}_{A} = E_{AB}$.\n- Inflow is the delivered energy from $B$: $\\text{inflows}_{A} = (1-\\eta)E_{BA}$.\n- Loss is allocated from its own dispatch: $L_{A} = \\eta E_{AB}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the balance equation for region $A$:\n$$S_A + (1-\\eta)E_{BA} = D_A + E_{AB} + \\eta E_{AB}$$\nSolving for $S_A$:\n$$S_A = D_A + E_{AB} + \\eta E_{AB} - (1-\\eta)E_{BA} = D_A + (1+\\eta)E_{AB} - (1-\\eta)E_{BA}$$\n\nFor region $B$:\n- Outflow is the gross dispatch: $\\text{outflows}_{B} = E_{BA}$.\n- Inflow is the delivered energy from $A$: $\\text{inflows}_{B} = (1-\\eta)E_{AB}$.\n- Loss is allocated from its own dispatch: $L_{B} = \\eta E_{BA}$.\n\nSubstituting into the balance equation for region $B$:\n$$S_B + (1-\\eta)E_{AB} = D_B + E_{BA} + \\eta E_{BA}$$\nSolving for $S_B$:\n$$S_B = D_B + E_{BA} + \\eta E_{BA} - (1-\\eta)E_{AB} = D_B + (1+\\eta)E_{BA} - (1-\\eta)E_{AB}$$\nThese expressions for $S_A$ and $S_B$ ensure the system is balanced with the true gross flows.\n\nNext, we analyze the information passed through the soft-link. The upstream model computes the net flow $N_{AB}$:\n$$N_{AB} = (1-\\eta)(E_{AB} - E_{BA})$$\nUsing the specified test data, $E_{AB} = E_{BA} = Q = 100$ TJ and $\\eta = 0.05$:\n$$N_{AB} = (1-0.05)(100 - 100) = 0.95 \\times 0 = 0$$\n\nThe naïve converter then reconstructs gross flows from this net flow:\n$$\\tilde{E}_{AB} = \\max(N_{AB}, 0) = \\max(0, 0) = 0$$\n$$\\tilde{E}_{BA} = \\max(-N_{AB}, 0) = \\max(0, 0) = 0$$\nThe reconstructed losses are consequently zero:\n$$\\tilde{L}_{A} = \\eta \\tilde{E}_{AB} = 0$$\n$$\\tilde{L}_{B} = \\eta \\tilde{E}_{BA} = 0$$\nThe reconstructed inflows and outflows are also zero for both regions:\n$$\\tilde{\\text{inflows}}_{A} = (1-\\eta)\\tilde{E}_{BA} = 0, \\quad \\tilde{\\text{outflows}}_{A} = \\tilde{E}_{AB} = 0$$\n$$\\tilde{\\text{inflows}}_{B} = (1-\\eta)\\tilde{E}_{AB} = 0, \\quad \\tilde{\\text{outflows}}_{B} = \\tilde{E}_{BA} = 0$$\n\nNow, we compute the mass-balance violation in the downstream model when it uses these reconstructed values.

Substituting $E_{AB} = E_{BA} = Q$:\n$$V_B = (1+\\eta)Q - (1-\\eta)Q = 2\\eta Q$$\n\nThe total absolute mass-balance violation is the sum of the absolute values of the regional violations:\n$$V_{\\text{total}} = |V_A| + |V_B| = |2\\eta Q| + |2\\eta Q|$$\nSince $\\eta  0$ and $Q  0$, the absolute value signs are redundant.\n$$V_{\\text{total}} = 2\\eta Q + 2\\eta Q = 4\\eta Q$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the numerical values $Q = 100$ TJ and $\\eta = 0.05$:\n$$V_{\\text{total}} = 4 \\times 0.05 \\times 100 = 4 \\times 5 = 20 \\text{ TJ}$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of a soft-linking iterative process between an electricity demand module and a supply-side dispatch module. We must first demonstrate the existence of multiple equilibrium prices (fixed points) and then determine the specific equilibrium to which the process converges from a given starting price.\n\nThe aggregate electricity demand $Q$ in MW is a function of the price $p$ in $/MWh$, given by the linear inverse demand function:\n$$Q(p) = \\alpha - \\beta p$$\nwith given parameters $\\alpha = 220$ and $\\beta = 2$.\n\nThe dispatch module minimizes the total cost of supplying the quantity $Q$ using two technologies:\n- Technology A (baseload): variable cost $c_A = 30$ $/MWh$, startup cost $S_A = 5000$ $\\$$, minimum output $m_A = 100$ $\\mathrm{MW}$, and maximum output $M_A = 400$ $\\mathrm{MW}$.\n- Technology B (peaking): variable cost $c_B = 70$ $/MWh$, with no startup cost or capacity limit.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the decision logic of the dispatch module. First, we determine the condition under which the baseload technology A is committed (i.e., started). According to the problem statement, technology A is started if and only if two conditions are met:\n1. The demand is sufficient to meet the minimum stable output: $Q \\ge m_A$.\n2. The total cost of generation with A committed is less than or equal to the cost of meeting the entire demand with technology B. The cost of generating a quantity $Q$ using only technology B is $c_B Q$. The cost when technology A is started to help meet demand is $S_A + c_A Q$ (assuming A can satisfy the whole demand, which is the basis for the commitment decision). This condition is stated as $S_A + c_A Q \\le c_B Q$.\n\nLet's analyze the second condition by substituting the given values:\n$S_A \\le (c_B - c_A) Q$\n$5000 \\le (70 - 30) Q$\n$5000 \\le 40 Q$\n$$Q \\ge \\frac{5000}{40} = 125 \\, \\mathrm{MW}$$\nThe first condition is $Q \\ge m_A = 100 \\, \\mathrm{MW}$. Since $125 \\, \\mathrm{MW} > 100 \\, \\mathrm{MW}$, the condition $Q \\ge 125$ is stricter and implies $Q \\ge 100$. Therefore, technology A is committed if and only if $Q \\ge 125 \\, \\mathrm{MW}$. This nonconvexity (an all-or-nothing decision with a startup cost) is the source of the complex behavior.\n\nNow, we define the iterative map $p^{(k+1)} = G(p^{(k)})$. At each iteration $k$, given a price $p^{(k)}$, the demand is $Q^{(k)} = \\alpha - \\beta p^{(k)} = 220 - 2p^{(k)}$. The dispatch module then determines the least-cost supply plan and reports the marginal cost as the next price, $p^{(k+1)}$.\n\nWe can define the function $G(p)$ by considering two cases based on the commitment threshold $Q = 125 \\, \\mathrm{MW}$.\nFirst, let's find the price $p$ that corresponds to this threshold quantity:\n$125 = 220 - 2p \\implies 2p = 220 - 125 = 95 \\implies p = 47.5 \\, \\$/MWh$.\n\nCase 1: $Q  125 \\, \\mathrm{MW}$ (which corresponds to $p  47.5 \\, \\$/MWh$)\nIn this case, technology A is not committed. The entire demand $Q$ must be served by technology B. The marginal cost is the variable cost of technology B.\nThus, for $p  47.5$, the next price is $p^{(k+1)} = c_B = 70$.\n\nCase 2: $Q \\ge 125 \\, \\mathrm{MW}$ (which corresponds to $p \\le 47.5 \\, \\$/MWh$)\nIn this case, technology A is committed. The dispatch will use the cheaper technology A as much as possible, up to its maximum capacity $M_A = 400 \\, \\mathrm{MW}$.\nThe demand is $Q(p) = 220 - 2p$. For $p \\ge 0$, the maximum possible demand is $Q(0) = 220 \\, \\mathrm{MW}$.\nSince the demand in this regime ($p \\le 47.5$) satisfies $125 \\le Q \\le 220$, and this range is entirely within technology A's operating limits ($m_A = 100 \\le Q \\le M_A = 400$), technology A can meet the entire demand alone.\nThe dispatch will be $q_A = Q$ and $q_B = 0$. The marginal unit is technology A.\nThus, for $p \\le 47.5$, the next price is $p^{(k+1)} = c_A = 30$.\n\nCombining these cases, the iterative mapping function $p' = G(p)$ is a piecewise constant function:\n$$G(p) = \\begin{cases} 30  \\text{if } p \\le 47.5 \\\\ 70  \\text{if } p  47.5 \\end{cases}$$\n\n**Task 1: Demonstrate the existence of multiple fixed points**\nA fixed point $p^{\\star}$ of the mapping is a price such that $p^{\\star} = G(p^{\\star})$. We search for fixed points in each piece of the function's domain.\n\n- Assume $p^{\\star} \\le 47.5$. The fixed-point equation is $p^{\\star} = G(p^{\\star}) = 30$. The value $p^{\\star} = 30$ is consistent with the assumption $30 \\le 47.5$. Thus, $p_1^{\\star} = 30 \\, \\$/MWh$ is a fixed point.\nLet's verify: If $p=30$, $Q = 220 - 2(30) = 160$. Since $160 \\ge 125$, A is committed. Since $100 \\le 160 \\le 400$, A serves all demand. Marginal cost is $c_A=30$. The next price is $30$.\n\n- Assume $p^{\\star}  47.5$. The fixed-point equation is $p^{\\star} = G(p^{\\star}) = 70$. The value $p^{\\star} = 70$ is consistent with the assumption $70  47.5$. Thus, $p_2^{\\star} = 70 \\, \\$/MWh$ is a fixed point.\nLet's verify: If $p=70$, $Q = 220 - 2(70) = 80$. Since $80  125$, A is not committed. B serves all demand. Marginal cost is $c_B=70$. The next price is $70$.\n\nWe have successfully found two distinct fixed points, $p_1^{\\star} = 30$ and $p_2^{\\star} = 70$. This demonstrates that multiple equilibria can exist due to the nonconvex operating constraint (the startup cost) of technology A.\n\n**Task 2: Compute the equilibrium price for an initial price of $p^{(0)} = 75$**\nWe now apply the iterative mapping $p^{(k+1)} = G(p^{(k)})$ starting with $p^{(0)} = 75 \\, \\$/MWh$.\n\n- Iteration $k=0$:\nThe initial price is $p^{(0)} = 75$.\nSince $p^{(0)} = 75  47.5$, we are in the upper branch of the mapping function.\nThe next price is $p^{(1)} = G(75) = 70$.\n\n- Iteration $k=1$:\nThe current price is $p^{(1)} = 70$.\nSince $p^{(1)} = 70  47.5$, we are again in the upper branch of the mapping function.\nThe next price is $p^{(2)} = G(70) = 70$.\n\nSince $p^{(2)} = p^{(1)} = 70$, the iteration has converged. For all subsequent iterations $k \\ge 1$, we will have $p^{(k)} = 70$. The equilibrium price to which the iteration converges is $p^{\\star} = 70 \\, \\$/MWh$.\nThe sequence of prices is $75, 70, 70, 70, \\dots$.\nThe convergent equilibrium price is $70 \\, \\$/MWh$.",
