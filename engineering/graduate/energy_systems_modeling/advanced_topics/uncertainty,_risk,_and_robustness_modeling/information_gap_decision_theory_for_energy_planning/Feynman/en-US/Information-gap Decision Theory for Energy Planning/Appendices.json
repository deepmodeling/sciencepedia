            "solution": "The problem asks for the robustness function $\\hat{\\alpha}(d)$ for a given investment decision $d$. The robustness represents the maximum level of uncertainty a decision can withstand while satisfying a performance requirement. The robustness function is formally defined as:\n$$\n\\hat{\\alpha}(d) = \\sup\\left\\{\\alpha \\ge 0:\\ \\sup_{u \\in U(\\alpha)} J(d,u) \\le B\\right\\}.\n$$\nFirst, we must find the worst-case cost, $\\sup_{u \\in U(\\alpha)} J(d,u)$. The cost function is $J(d,u) = 100d + 2du$. The decision variable $d$ is non-negative, so the coefficient of the uncertain parameter $u$, which is $2d$, is also non-negative. This implies that the cost function $J(d,u)$ is a monotonically non-decreasing function of $u$.\n\nThe uncertainty in $u$ is modeled by the interval set $U(\\alpha) = \\{u:\\ |u - \\tilde{u}| \\le \\alpha\\}$. The maximum value of $u$ within this set occurs at the upper bound of the interval, which is $u_{\\text{max}} = \\tilde{u} + \\alpha$.\n\nBecause the cost function is monotonic in $u$, the worst-case cost corresponds to this maximum value of $u$:\n$$\n\\sup_{u \\in U(\\alpha)} J(d,u) = J(d, u_{\\text{max}}) = 100d + 2d(\\tilde{u} + \\alpha).\n$$\nTo find the robustness $\\hat{\\alpha}(d)$, we determine the largest value of $\\alpha$ for which this worst-case cost does not exceed the budget $B$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the robustness function $\\hat{\\alpha}(d)$ from Information-Gap Decision Theory (IGDT), followed by a diagnosis of the situation and the proposal of a remedy. The robustness function for a decision $d$ is defined as the maximum horizon of uncertainty $\\alpha$ for which a required performance constraint is met. The definition is:\n$$\n\\hat{\\alpha}(d) = \\sup\\big\\{\\, \\alpha \\geq 0 \\;:\\; \\max_{u \\in \\mathcal{U}(\\alpha)} L(d,u) \\leq \\bar{L} \\,\\big\\}\n$$\nThe primary task is to evaluate the constraint inside the supremum: $\\max_{u \\in \\mathcal{U}(\\alpha)} L(d,u) \\leq \\bar{L}$. To find the maximum of the Loss-of-Load Probability (LOLP) function, $L(d,u)$, over the uncertainty set $\\mathcal{U}(\\alpha)$, we first analyze the behavior of $L(d,u)$ with respect to the uncertain parameter $u$. The function is given as:\n$$\nL(d,u) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(\\beta (d - u))}\n$$\nTo determine if the function is monotonic in $u$, we compute its partial derivative with respect to $u$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial u} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u} \\left[ (1 + \\exp(\\beta(d-u)))^{-1} \\right]\n$$\nUsing the chain rule, this becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial u} = -1 \\cdot (1 + \\exp(\\beta(d-u)))^{-2} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u} (\\exp(\\beta(d-u))) = - (1 + \\exp(\\beta(d-u)))^{-2} \\cdot \\exp(\\beta(d-u)) \\cdot (-\\beta)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial u} = \\frac{\\beta \\exp(\\beta(d-u))}{(1 + \\exp(\\beta(d-u)))^2}\n$$\nGiven that the steepness parameter $\\beta > 0$ and the exponential function is always positive, the derivative $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial u}$ is strictly positive for all values of its arguments. This proves that $L(d,u)$ is a monotonically increasing function of the peak demand $u$. Therefore, a higher peak demand $u$ invariably leads to a higher Loss-of-Load Probability.\n\nThe uncertainty in $u$ is modeled by the interval $\\mathcal{U}(\\alpha) = [\\,\\tilde{u}(1-\\alpha),\\, \\tilde{u}(1+\\alpha)\\,]$. Because $L(d,u)$ is monotonically increasing in $u$, its maximum value over this interval will be attained at the interval's upper bound, where $u$ is at its maximum possible value:\n$$\nu_{\\max} = \\tilde{u}(1+\\alpha)\n$$\nConsequently, the constraint defining the robustness simplifies to evaluating the LOLP function at this worst-case demand:\n$$\nL(d, u_{\\max}) \\leq \\bar{L} \\quad \\implies \\quad L(d, \\tilde{u}(1+\\alpha)) \\leq \\bar{L}\n$$\nFor the robustness $\\hat{\\alpha}(d)$ to be greater than zero, this inequality must hold for some range of $\\alpha > 0$. A necessary condition for this is that the inequality must hold for the base case where there is no uncertainty, i.e., at $\\alpha=0$. When $\\alpha=0$, the uncertainty set collapses to the single point estimate, $\\mathcal{U}(0) = \\{\\tilde{u}\\}$, and the performance requirement becomes:\n$$\nL(d, \\tilde{u}) \\leq \\bar{L}\n$$\nWe must now test this condition with the provided data: $d = 10 \\ \\mathrm{GW}$, $\\tilde{u} = 9.5 \\ \\mathrm{GW}$, $\\beta = 5$, and $\\bar{L} = 0.05$. We calculate the nominal LOLP, $L(10, 9.5)$:\n$$\nL(10, 9.5) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(5 \\cdot (10 - 9.5))} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(5 \\cdot 0.5)} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(2.5)}\n$$\nThe value of $\\exp(2.5)$ is approximately $12.1825$. Substituting this gives:\n$$\nL(10, 9.5) \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + 12.1825} = \\frac{1}{13.1825} \\approx 0.075859\n$$\nWe now compare the calculated nominal LOLP with the required tolerance $\\bar{L}$:\n$$\n0.075859 > 0.05\n$$\nThe condition $L(d, \\tilde{u}) \\leq \\bar{L}$ is violated. The power system, with the proposed capacity $d=10 \\ \\mathrm{GW}$, fails to meet the reliability requirement even when the peak demand is exactly at its baseline estimate $\\tilde{u}$.\n\nSince $L(d, \\tilde{u}(1+\\alpha))$ is an increasing function of $\\alpha$ (because $u_{\\max}$ increases with $\\alpha$), and the condition fails for $\\alpha=0$, it will necessarily fail for all $\\alpha > 0$. This means the set of non-negative values of $\\alpha$ for which the reliability requirement is met, $\\{\\, \\alpha \\geq 0 \\;:\\; \\max_{u \\in \\mathcal{U}(\\alpha)} L(d,u) \\leq \\bar{L} \\,\\}$, is the empty set. By convention in IGDT, the supremum of an empty set of non-negative numbers is $0$.\nTherefore, the robustness of this decision is $\\hat{\\alpha}(d) = 0$.\n\nThe diagnosis of the situation is straightforward: the planned capacity of $d=10 \\ \\mathrm{GW}$ is inadequate for the system's reliability targets. It fails to perform acceptably even under the nominal, best-estimate conditions, before any uncertainty is even considered. The system has zero robustness to any unforeseen increase in peak demand because it is already failing in the nominal scenario.\n\nTo achieve a positive robustness, $\\hat{\\alpha}(d) > 0$, the system parameters must be adjusted such that the nominal performance is acceptable, i.e., $L(d, \\tilde{u}) < \\bar{L}$. The most direct quantitative remedy is to increase the installed capacity $d$. We can compute the minimum critical capacity, $d_{\\text{crit}}$, required to exactly meet the nominal target: $L(d_{\\text{crit}}, \\tilde{u}) = \\bar{L}$.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(\\beta(d_{\\text{crit}} - \\tilde{u}))} = \\bar{L}\n$$\nSolving for $d_{\\text{crit}}$:\n$$\n1 + \\exp(\\beta(d_{\\text{crit}} - \\tilde{u})) = \\frac{1}{\\bar{L}} \\implies \\exp(\\beta(d_{\\text{crit}} - \\tilde{u})) = \\frac{1}{\\bar{L}} - 1 = \\frac{1-\\bar{L}}{\\bar{L}}\n$$\n$$\nd_{\\text{crit}} = \\tilde{u} + \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-\\bar{L}}{\\bar{L}}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nd_{\\text{crit}} = 9.5 + \\frac{1}{5} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - 0.05}{0.05}\\right) = 9.5 + 0.2 \\ln\\left(19\\right)\n$$\nUsing $\\ln(19) \\approx 2.9444$, we find:\n$$\nd_{\\text{crit}} \\approx 9.5 + 0.2 \\cdot 2.9444 = 9.5 + 0.58888 = 10.08888 \\ \\mathrm{GW}\n$$\nTherefore, a specific quantitative remedy is to increase the installed capacity to any value greater than $10.08888 \\ \\mathrm{GW}$, for instance, setting $d = 10.1 \\ \\mathrm{GW}$. This action would ensure that $L(10.1, 9.5) < 0.05$, which in turn guarantees that $\\hat{\\alpha}(10.1) > 0$.",

If demand exceeds capacity ($D > k$): The cost is $C(k,D) = rk + gk + \\lambda(D-k) = (r+g-\\lambda)k + \\lambda D$.\n\nThe first step is to determine the optimal decision $k_E$ that minimizes the expected cost, $\\mathbb{E}[C(k,D)]$. The demand $D$ is a discrete random variable with the following distribution: $D_1 = 60$ with probability $p_1 = 0.9$, and $D_2 = 140$ with probability $p_2 = 0.1$.\n\nThe expected cost, denoted as $F(k) = \\mathbb{E}[C(k,D)]$, is calculated as:\n$$\nF(k) = p_1 C(k, D_1) + p_2 C(k, D_2)\n$$\nThe function $F(k)$ is piecewise linear and convex, with changes in slope occurring only at the demand levels $D_1=60$ and $D_2=140$. The minimum of such a function must occur at one of these points. We analyze the derivative of $F(k)$ in the intervals defined by these points.\n\n\nCase 1: $k < 60$. In this region, $k < D_1$ and $k < D_2$.\n$$\nF(k) = p_1 ((r+g-\\lambda)k + \\lambda D_1) + p_2 ((r+g-\\lambda)k + \\lambda D_2)\n$$\n$$\nF(k) = (r+g-\\lambda)k + \\lambda(p_1 D_1 + p_2 D_2)\n$$\nThe slope of $F(k)$ is $\\frac{dF}{dk} = r+g-\\lambda = 50 + 20 - 200 = -130$. Since the slope is negative, the expected cost decreases as $k$ increases towards $60$.\n\nCase 2: $60 \\le k < 140$. In this region, $D_1 \\le k$ but $D_2 > k$.\n$$\nF(k) = p_1(rk + gD_1) + p_2((r+g-\\lambda)k + \\lambda D_2)\n$$\n$$\nF(k) = (p_1 r + p_2(r+g-\\lambda))k + p_1 g D_1 + p_2 \\lambda D_2\n$$\nThe slope of $F(k)$ is $\\frac{dF}{dk} = p_1 r + p_2(r+g-\\lambda) = (p_1+p_2)r + p_2(g-\\lambda) = r + p_2(g-\\lambda)$.\nSubstituting the values: $\\frac{dF}{dk} = 50 + 0.1(20 - 200) = 50 + 0.1(-180) = 50 - 18 = 32$. Since the slope is positive, the expected cost increases for $k$ in this interval.\n\nThe slope of the expected cost function $F(k)$ changes from negative ($-130$) to positive ($32$) at $k=60$. Therefore, the expected cost is minimized at $k=60$. The expected-cost optimal decision is $k_E = 60$.\n\nThe second step is to compute the Information-Gap Decision Theory (IGDT) robustness $\\hat{\\alpha}(k_E)$ for the decision $k_E=60$. The robustness is defined as the maximum horizon of uncertainty $\\alpha$ for which the cost is guaranteed to not exceed a critical value $\\Gamma = 13000$.\n$$\n\\hat{\\alpha}(k_E) = \\sup\\left\\{ \\alpha \\ge 0 \\,:\\, \\sup_{D \\in \\mathcal{U}(\\alpha)} C(k_E,D) \\le \\Gamma \\right\\}\n$$\nThe uncertainty set for demand is $\\mathcal{U}(\\alpha) = \\{D \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+} : |D - D_0| \\le \\alpha D_0\\}$.

Let's analyze $C(60,D)$ as a function of $D$:\n$$\nC(60,D) = r(60) + g\\,\\min\\{D,60\\} + \\lambda\\,\\max\\{D-60,0\\}\n$$\n$$\nC(60,D) = 50(60) + 20\\min\\{D,60\\} + 200\\max\\{D-60,0\\}\n$$\n- If $D \\le 60$: $C(60,D) = 3000 + 20D$. The partial derivative with respect to $D$ is $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial D} = 20$.\n- If $D > 60$: $C(60,D) = 3000 + 20(60) + 200(D-60) = 4200 + 200D - 12000 = 200D - 7800$. The partial derivative is $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial D} = 200$.\n\nSince the slope is positive for all $D \\ge 0$, the cost function $C(60,D)$ is monotonically increasing in $D$. Therefore, the maximum cost over the uncertainty interval $\\mathcal{U}(\\alpha)$ will occur at the largest possible demand, $D_{max} = 100(1+\\alpha)$.\n\nFor any $\\alpha \\ge 0$, $D_{max} = 100(1+\\alpha) \\ge 100$, which is greater than $k_E = 60$. We thus use the cost expression for $D > 60$:\n$$\n\\sup_{D \\in \\mathcal{U}(\\alpha)} C(60,D) = C(60, D_{max}) = 200 D_{max} - 7800\n$$\n$$\nC(60, 100(1+\\alpha)) = 200(100(1+\\alpha)) - 7800 = 20000(1+\\alpha) - 7800\n$$\nTo find the robustness $\\hat{\\alpha}(60)$, we set this worst-case cost equal to the critical cost $\\Gamma = 13000$ and solve for $\\alpha$:\n$$\n20000(1+\\alpha) - 7800 = 13000\n$$\n$$\n20000(1+\\alpha) = 13000 + 7800 = 20800\n$$\n$$\n1+\\alpha = \\frac{20800}{20000} = \\frac{208}{200} = 1.04\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha = 1.04 - 1 = 0.04\n$$\nThus, the IGDT robustness for the expected-cost optimal decision $k_E=60$ is $\\hat{\\alpha}(k_E) = 0.04$.",
