## Introduction
In the modeling of complex energy systems, from power grid operations to long-term infrastructure planning, uncertainty is not a peripheral concern but a central reality. Input parameters such as fuel costs, technology learning rates, and renewable resource availability are inherently uncertain, and failing to account for this uncertainty can lead to flawed conclusions, brittle designs, and poor policy decisions. Simple approaches often fall victim to the "flaw of averages," where model predictions based on mean-value inputs can be systematically biased and dangerously misleading. To make robust decisions, we require a rigorous framework for understanding, propagating, and analyzing the impact of uncertainty on model outcomes.

This article introduces the powerful tandem of Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) as the cornerstone of [modern analysis](@entry_id:146248) for systems under uncertainty. UQ provides the tools to characterize the full range of possible outcomes, while GSA identifies the key drivers of that uncertainty, allowing analysts to prioritize research, data collection, and risk mitigation efforts. Across the following chapters, this article provides a structured journey from foundational theory to practical application.

First, the chapter on **Principles and Mechanisms** will establish the core mathematical and conceptual framework. We will distinguish between different types of uncertainty, introduce the fundamental Monte Carlo method for [uncertainty propagation](@entry_id:146574), and delve into the [variance decomposition](@entry_id:272134) techniques that underpin GSA. Next, the chapter on **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections** will demonstrate how these methods are applied to solve real-world problems in energy systems and a variety of other scientific fields, highlighting the versatility and power of the UQ/GSA toolkit. Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** section will provide a series of targeted problems designed to solidify your understanding and build practical skills in implementing these essential analytical techniques.

## Principles and Mechanisms

This chapter delves into the fundamental principles and mechanisms that underpin Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA). We will move from foundational concepts, such as the classification of uncertainty, to the core computational methods used to propagate and analyze it. The goal is to build a rigorous conceptual and mathematical framework for understanding and managing uncertainty in complex energy systems models.

### The Nature of Uncertainty in Energy Systems Models
A critical first step in any rigorous uncertainty analysis is to classify the types of uncertainty present in a model. The two primary categories are **aleatory** and **epistemic** uncertainty. The distinction is not merely semantic; it has profound implications for how uncertainty is modeled, propagated, and interpreted in the context of decision-making.

**Aleatory uncertainty** refers to the inherent variability or randomness in a system. It is often described as statistical uncertainty or irreducible randomness. This type of uncertainty cannot be reduced by gathering more information about the system's current state. For example, the precise wind speed at a specific location one hour from now is uncertain due to the chaotic nature of [atmospheric turbulence](@entry_id:200206). While we can collect vast amounts of historical data to build a very accurate probability distribution for wind speed (e.g., a Weibull distribution), the outcome of a single future realization remains inherently random. This randomness is captured by a fixed probability measure, $P$.

**Epistemic uncertainty**, in contrast, arises from a lack of knowledge. It is also known as [systematic uncertainty](@entry_id:263952) or reducible uncertainty because it can, in principle, be reduced by collecting more data, conducting further research, or refining models. For instance, long-term capital cost projections for a new energy technology depend on future market dynamics, policy decisions, and [technological learning](@entry_id:1132886) rates. Our uncertainty about these costs is not due to inherent randomness, but to our incomplete knowledge of the future. This is often represented by assigning a range of plausible values or a [subjective probability](@entry_id:271766) distribution (a Bayesian prior) to a model parameter $\theta$. 

In many sophisticated energy systems models, both types of uncertainty are present simultaneously. Consider a model for wind farm performance whose output $Y$ depends on the instantaneous wind speed $v$ (an aleatory variable) and long-term capital cost parameters $\theta$ (epistemic parameters). A robust analytical framework must separate these two sources of uncertainty. A powerful tool for this is the **law of total variance**, which provides a formal decomposition. If we represent our lack of knowledge about $\theta$ with a distribution, the total variance of the output $Y = g(v, \theta)$ can be decomposed as:

$$
\operatorname{Var}(Y) = \mathbb{E}_{\theta}\! \left[ \operatorname{Var}\! \left(Y \mid \theta \right) \right] + \operatorname{Var}_{\theta}\! \left( \mathbb{E}\! \left[Y \mid \theta \right] \right)
$$

This decomposition is exceptionally insightful . The first term, $\mathbb{E}_{\theta}\! \left[ \operatorname{Var}\! \left(Y \mid \theta \right) \right]$, is the expected value of the [conditional variance](@entry_id:183803). It represents the average output variability due to the aleatory inputs, averaged over all our possible beliefs about the epistemic parameters. This is the **aleatory contribution** to total uncertainty. The second term, $\operatorname{Var}_{\theta}\! \left( \mathbb{E}\! \left[Y \mid \theta \right] \right)$, is the variance of the [conditional expectation](@entry_id:159140). It captures how much the *expected* output changes as we vary our assumptions about the epistemic parameters. This is the **epistemic contribution**. This separation allows analysts to distinguish between the uncertainty inherent in system operation and the uncertainty stemming from a lack of knowledge, which might be reduced through further research.

### Propagating Uncertainty: The Monte Carlo Method

Once uncertain inputs and their distributions are defined, the central task of UQ is to propagate this uncertainty through the model $Y = g(\mathbf{X})$ to characterize the distribution of the output $Y$. For most energy systems models, which are complex and nonlinear, analytical derivation of the output distribution is intractable.

The foundational computational technique for uncertainty propagation is the **Monte Carlo (MC) method**. Its procedure is conceptually straightforward :

1.  **Sampling**: Draw a large number, $n$, of [independent and identically distributed](@entry_id:169067) (i.i.d.) samples, $\{\mathbf{X}^{(i)}\}_{i=1}^{n}$, from the [joint probability distribution](@entry_id:264835) of the input vector $\mathbf{X}$.

2.  **Evaluation**: For each input sample $\mathbf{X}^{(i)}$, evaluate the model to obtain a corresponding output value, $Y^{(i)} = g(\mathbf{X}^{(i)})$. This generates a sample of outputs $\{Y^{(i)}\}_{i=1}^{n}$.

3.  **Estimation**: Use statistical estimators on the output sample to approximate properties of the true output distribution. For example, the [sample mean](@entry_id:169249) $\hat{\mu}_Y = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} Y^{(i)}$ estimates the true mean $\mathbb{E}[Y]$, and the [sample variance](@entry_id:164454) $s_Y^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y^{(i)} - \hat{\mu}_Y)^2$ estimates the true variance $\operatorname{Var}(Y)$.

The power of the MC method stems from fundamental theorems of statistics. The **Law of Large Numbers** guarantees that the sample mean $\hat{\mu}_Y$ is a [consistent estimator](@entry_id:266642) of $\mathbb{E}[Y]$, meaning it converges to the true value as $n \to \infty$. Furthermore, provided the output variance $\operatorname{Var}(Y)$ is finite, the **Central Limit Theorem** states that the error of the sample mean estimator decreases proportionally to $n^{-1/2}$. A remarkable feature of the MC method is that this convergence rate is independent of the dimension of the input space $\mathbf{X}$, making it particularly suitable for the high-dimensional models often found in energy [systems analysis](@entry_id:275423) .

It is crucial to avoid common fallacies when dealing with nonlinear models. A frequent mistake is to assume that the mean of the output is equal to the output of the mean inputs, i.e., $\mathbb{E}[g(\mathbf{X})] = g(\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{X}])$. This property, sometimes called the "flaw of averages," holds only for linear models. For a nonlinear model, such as one for the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE), this shortcut yields an incorrect result, underscoring the necessity of a full propagation method like Monte Carlo . Similarly, first-order Taylor series approximations for variance (the "[delta method](@entry_id:276272)") are only accurate for nearly [linear models](@entry_id:178302) and should not be relied upon for exact results in nonlinear settings.

While [simple random sampling](@entry_id:754862) is robust, its convergence can be slow. Advanced sampling techniques, such as **[stratified sampling](@entry_id:138654)** or **Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC)** methods using [low-discrepancy sequences](@entry_id:139452), can often reduce the variance of the estimators for a given sample size $n$, leading to more efficient estimation of output moments and other properties .

### Global Sensitivity Analysis: Decomposing Output Variance

Beyond characterizing the overall output uncertainty, we often want to understand which input uncertainties are most responsible for it. This is the domain of **Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA)**. The most prominent GSA framework is variance-based, built upon the **Hoeffding-Sobol ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) decomposition**. For a model with independent inputs, the total output variance, $\operatorname{Var}(Y)$, can be uniquely decomposed into contributions from individual inputs ([main effects](@entry_id:169824)) and their interactions.
