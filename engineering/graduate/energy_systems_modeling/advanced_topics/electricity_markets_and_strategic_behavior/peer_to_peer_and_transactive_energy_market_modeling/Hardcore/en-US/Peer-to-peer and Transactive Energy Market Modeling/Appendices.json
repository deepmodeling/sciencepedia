            "problem": "Consider a single prosumer agent in a peer-to-peer (P2P) transactive energy market who operates an idealized battery to arbitrage temporal price differences. The agent participates in a sequence of $T$ settlement intervals indexed by $t \\in \\{1,\\dots,T\\}$. At each interval $t$, the market-clearing price is $p_t$ dollars per megawatt-hour ($/MWh$), the agent can buy energy from peers (charge the battery) at the price $p_t$, or sell energy to peers (discharge the battery) at the same price $p_t$. The battery has one-way charging efficiency $\\eta_c \\in (0,1]$ and one-way discharging efficiency $\\eta_d \\in (0,1]$, energy capacity $S_{\\max}$ in megawatt-hours (MWh), initial state of charge $s_0$ in MWh, and a target terminal state of charge $s_T^{\\text{target}}$ in MWh. Let $c_t \\ge 0$ be the market energy bought to charge the battery at time $t$ (in MWh) and $d_t \\ge 0$ be the market energy sold from discharging the battery at time $t$ (in MWh). The state of charge is $s_t$ in MWh at the end of interval $t$.\n\nFundamental base:\n- Energy conservation and efficiency: Charging $c_t$ increases stored energy by $\\eta_c c_t$, and discharging $d_t$ decreases stored energy by $d_t/\\eta_d$.\n- Market settlement: Buying $c_t$ pays $p_t c_t$ and selling $d_t$ earns $p_t d_t$.\n\nDecision variables are the sequences $(c_t)_{t=1}^T$, $(d_t)_{t=1}^T$, and $(s_t)_{t=1}^T$ obeying the following constraints derived from these foundations:\n- State transition for all $t \\in \\{1,\\dots,T\\}$: $s_t = s_{t-1} + \\eta_c c_t - \\frac{d_t}{\\eta_d}$, with $s_0$ given.\n- Energy capacity bounds for all $t$: $0 \\le s_t \\le S_{\\max}$.\n- Non-negativity and per-interval physical feasibility bounds for all $t$: $0 \\le c_t \\le \\frac{S_{\\max}}{\\eta_c}$ and $0 \\le d_t \\le \\eta_d S_{\\max}$.\n- Terminal state target: $s_T = s_T^{\\text{target}}$.\n\nThe agent's objective is to maximize the cumulative arbitrage profit $\\sum_{t=1}^T p_t(d_t - c_t)$ subject to these constraints. This is a linear program in $(c_t,d_t,s_t)$ that can be solved exactly and efficiently.\n\nYour task is to implement a program that, for each test case, computes optimal sequences $(c_t)_{t=1}^T$ and $(d_t)_{t=1}^T$ that maximize the arbitrage profit under the constraints.

            "solution": "The user's problem is a well-posed optimization task grounded in the principles of energy systems modeling, specifically battery arbitrage in a transactive energy market. The problem is to determine the optimal charging and discharging schedule for a battery to maximize profit, given a series of electricity prices and the battery's physical constraints. This can be formulated and solved as a Linear Program (LP).\n\nThe objective is to maximize the total profit, which is the sum of revenues from selling energy minus the costs of buying energy over the time horizon $T$. The profit function is:\n$$ \\text{Maximize} \\quad \\Pi = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} p_t (d_t - c_t) $$\nwhere $p_t$ is the price at time $t$, $d_t$ is the energy sold (discharged), and $c_t$ is the energy bought (charged).\n\nThis maximization is subject to several linear constraints:\n1.  State of Charge (SOC) transition: The energy stored at the end of interval $t$, $s_t$, is determined by the energy stored at the previous interval, $s_{t-1}$, and the energy charged or discharged, adjusted for efficiencies.\n    $$ s_t = s_{t-1} + \\eta_c c_t - \\frac{d_t}{\\eta_d} \\quad \\text{for } t \\in \\{1, \\dots, T\\} $$\n    with $s_0$ being the given initial state of charge.\n\n2.  Capacity limits: The state of charge must remain within the physical capacity of the battery.\n    $$ 0 \\le s_t \\le S_{\\max} \\quad \\text{for } t \\in \\{1, \\dots, T\\} $$\n\n3.  Non-negativity: Energy cannot be \"uncharged\" or \"undischarged\".\n    $$ c_t \\ge 0, \\quad d_t \\ge 0 \\quad \\text{for } t \\in \\{1, \\dots, T\\} $$\n\n4.  Terminal state: The state of charge at the end of the horizon must meet a specific target.\n    $$ s_T = s_T^{\\text{target}} $$\n\nThe problem is a linear program because both the objective function and all constraints are linear functions of the decision variables $(c_t)_{t=1}^T$, $(d_t)_{t=1}^T$, and $(s_t)_{t=1}^T$. We can solve this using a standard LP solver, such as `scipy.optimize.linprog`.\n\nTo use the solver, we first formulate the problem in its standard form:\n$$ \\min_{\\mathbf{x}} \\mathbf{c}_{\\text{LP}}^T \\mathbf{x} \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad \\mathbf{A}_{\\text{eq}} \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}_{\\text{eq}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mathbf{l} \\le \\mathbf{x} \\le \\mathbf{u} $$\n\n1.  **Decision Vector $\\mathbf{x}$**: The decision variables are concatenated into a single vector $\\mathbf{x}$ of size $3T$:\n    $$ \\mathbf{x} = [c_1, \\dots, c_T, d_1, \\dots, d_T, s_1, \\dots, s_T]^T $$\n\n2.  **Objective Vector $\\mathbf{c}_{\\text{LP}}$**: Since `scipy.optimize.linprog` performs minimization, we minimize the negative of our profit function: $\\min \\sum_{t=1}^{T} p_t (c_t - d_t)$. The corresponding objective vector $\\mathbf{c}_{\\text{LP}}$ of size $3T$ is:\n    $$ \\mathbf{c}_{\\text{LP}} = [p_1, \\dots, p_T, -p_1, \\dots, -p_T, 0, \\dots, 0]^T $$\n    The final $T$ zeros correspond to the $s_t$ variables, which do not appear in the objective function.\n\n3.  **Equality Constraints $(\\mathbf{A}_{\\text{eq}}, \\mathbf{b}_{\\text{eq}})$**: The state transition equations form the set of equality constraints. We can rewrite them as:\n    $$ -\\eta_c c_t + \\frac{1}{\\eta_d} d_t + s_t - s_{t-1} = 0 \\quad \\text{for } t > 1 $$\n    $$ -\\eta_c c_1 + \\frac{1}{\\eta_d} d_1 + s_1 = s_0 \\quad \\text{for } t = 1 $$\n    These $T$ equations form a $T \\times 3T$ matrix $\\mathbf{A}_{\\text{eq}}$ and a vector $\\mathbf{b}_{\\text{eq}}$ of size $T$. For each row $i$ (from $0$ to $T-1$, corresponding to time $t=i+1$), the non-zero entries of $\\mathbf{A}_{\\text{eq}}$ capture the coefficients of $c_{i+1}$, $d_{i+1}$, $s_{i+1}$, and $s_i$. The vector $\\mathbf{b}_{\\text{eq}}$ is $[s_0, 0, \\dots, 0]^T$.\n\n4.  **Bounds $(\\mathbf{l}, \\mathbf{u})$**: The bounds for each variable in $\\mathbf{x}$ are derived from the problem constraints.\n    - For charge variables: $0 \\le c_t \\le S_{\\max} / \\eta_c$.\n    - For discharge variables: $0 \\le d_t \\le S_{\\max} \\cdot \\eta_d$.\n    - For state of charge variables: $0 \\le s_t \\le S_{\\max}$ for $t \\in \\{1, \\dots, T-1\\}$.\n    - For the terminal state of charge, the constraint $s_T = s_T^{\\text{target}}$ is enforced by setting its lower and upper bounds to be equal: $s_T^{\\text{target}} \\le s_T \\le s_T^{\\text{target}}$.\n\nBy constructing these matrices and vectors, the LP solver can find the optimal vector $\\mathbf{x}^*$, from which we extract the optimal charging sequence $(c_t^*)_{t=1}^T$ and discharging sequence $(d_t^*)_{t=1}^T$.",

            "problem": "Consider a single-interval Peer-to-Peer (P2P) transactive energy market with two prosumers. Each prosumer chooses a quantity to supply, denoted by $q_1$ and $q_2$, measured in megawatt-hours (MWh). The aggregate market quantity is $Q = q_1 + q_2$. The inverse demand is linear, given by $p(Q) = a - Q$, where $p$ is the market-clearing price in dollars per megawatt-hour ($/MWh$), and $a > 0$ is the demand intercept parameter. Prosumers incur convex quadratic costs $C_1(q_1) = c_1 q_1^2$ and $C_2(q_2) = c_2 q_2^2$, expressed in dollars. Each prosumer selects its quantity simultaneously to maximize its own profit, with profit function $\\pi_i(q_i, q_j) = p(Q)q_i - C_i(q_i)$ for $i \\in \\{1,2\\}$ and $j \\neq i$. The Nash Equilibrium (NE) is a profile $(q_1^\\star, q_2^\\star)$ such that both prosumers' choices are mutual best responses.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definitions of profit maximization and the Nash Equilibrium (NE), derive the first-order optimality conditions that characterize each prosumer’s best-response quantity as a function of the other’s quantity.

            "solution": "The user-provided problem is a valid, well-posed problem in microeconomic theory, specifically a Cournot duopoly model applied to a transactive energy market. All parameters are clearly defined, and the objective is mathematically sound. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the Nash Equilibrium (NE) of a single-interval energy market with two prosumers. The equilibrium is found by identifying a quantity profile $(q_1^\\star, q_2^\\star)$ where each prosumer's chosen quantity is a best response to the other's, meaning it maximizes their own profit given the other's choice.\n\nThe market is defined by the following components:\n- Prosumer quantities: $q_1, q_2$ in MWh.\n- Aggregate quantity: $Q = q_1 + q_2$.\n- Inverse demand function (price): $p(Q) = a - Q$, with $a > 0$.\n- Prosumer cost functions: $C_1(q_1) = c_1 q_1^2$ and $C_2(q_2) = c_2 q_2^2$.\n- Prosumer profit functions: $\\pi_i(q_i, q_j) = p(Q)q_i - C_i(q_i)$ for $i,j \\in \\{1,2\\}$ and $i \\neq j$.\n\nWe must also enforce the non-negativity constraints $q_1 \\ge 0$, $q_2 \\ge 0$, and ensure the resulting price is non-negative, $p \\ge 0$.\n\n### Derivation of Best-Response Functions\n\nTo find the Nash Equilibrium, we first derive each prosumer's best-response function. This function, denoted $BR_i(q_j)$, gives prosumer $i$'s profit-maximizing quantity for any given quantity $q_j$ produced by prosumer $j$.\n\nLet's first analyze prosumer $1$. Its profit function is:\n$$\n\\pi_1(q_1, q_2) = p(q_1 + q_2)q_1 - C_1(q_1)\n$$\nSubstituting the given functions for price and cost:\n$$\n\\pi_1(q_1, q_2) = (a - (q_1 + q_2))q_1 - c_1 q_1^2\n$$\n$$\n\\pi_1(q_1, q_2) = a q_1 - q_1^2 - q_2 q_1 - c_1 q_1^2\n$$\nTo find the quantity $q_1$ that maximizes this profit, we take the partial derivative of $\\pi_1$ with respect to $q_1$ (treating $q_2$ as a constant) and set it to zero. This is the first-order optimality condition (FOC):\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\pi_1}{\\partial q_1} = a - 2q_1 - q_2 - 2c_1 q_1 = 0\n$$\nThe second-order condition confirms this is a maximum, as $\\frac{\\partial^2 \\pi_1}{\\partial q_1^2} = -2 - 2c_1 = -2(1+c_1)  0$ since cost coefficients are positive.\n\nSolving the FOC for $q_1$:\n$$\na - q_2 = 2q_1 + 2c_1 q_1 = (2 + 2c_1)q_1\n$$\n$$\nq_1 = \\frac{a - q_2}{2(1 + c_1)}\n$$\nThis expression defines the optimal quantity for prosumer $1$ given $q_2$. However, we must respect the physical constraint that quantity cannot be negative, $q_1 \\ge 0$. Therefore, the best-response function for prosumer $1$ is:\n$$\nBR_1(q_2) = \\max\\left(0, \\frac{a - q_2}{2(1 + c_1)}\\right)\n$$\nBy symmetry, the derivation for prosumer $2$ is analogous. The profit function is:\n$$\n\\pi_2(q_1, q_2) = (a - (q_1 + q_2))q_2 - c_2 q_2^2\n$$\nThe FOC with respect to $q_2$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\pi_2}{\\partial q_2} = a - q_1 - 2q_2 - 2c_2 q_2 = 0\n$$\nSolving for $q_2$ and incorporating the non-negativity constraint $q_2 \\ge 0$ yields the best-response function for prosumer $2$:\n$$\nBR_2(q_1) = \\max\\left(0, \\frac{a - q_1}{2(1 + c_2)}\\right)\n$$\n### Nash Equilibrium and Fixed-Point Iteration\n\nA Nash Equilibrium $(q_1^\\star, q_2^\\star)$ is a state where both prosumers are playing their best response simultaneously. Mathematically, it is a fixed point of the best-response functions:\n$$\nq_1^\\star = BR_1(q_2^\\star) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad q_2^\\star = BR_2(q_1^\\star)\n$$\nThe problem requires finding this equilibrium using a numerical fixed-point method. We will use an iterative approach known as best-response dynamics (or Cournot adjustment). The algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1.  Initialize the quantities for both prosumers, for instance, $(q_1^{(0)}, q_2^{(0)}) = (0, 0)$.\n2.  For each iteration $k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots$, simultaneously update the quantities using the best-response functions:\n    $$\n    q_1^{(k+1)} = BR_1(q_2^{(k)})\n    $$\n    $$\n    q_2^{(k+1)} = BR_2(q_1^{(k)})\n    $$\n3.  Repeat step 2 until the quantities converge. Convergence is achieved when the change between successive iterations falls below a small tolerance, $\\epsilon$. That is, when $\\max(|q_1^{(k+1)} - q_1^{(k)}|, |q_2^{(k+1)} - q_2^{(k)}|)  \\epsilon$.\n\nThis iterative process is guaranteed to converge to the unique Nash Equilibrium for this model because the best-response functions form a contraction mapping under the given conditions.\n\n### Final Calculations\n\nOnce the iterative process converges to the equilibrium quantities $(q_1^\\star, q_2^\\star)$, we can compute the remaining market outcomes:\n-   Equilibrium aggregate quantity: $Q^\\star = q_1^\\star + q_2^\\star$.\n-   Equilibrium price: $p^\\star = a - Q^\\star$. The price will be non-negative as long as $c_1, c_2 \\ge 0$.\n-   Equilibrium profits:\n    $$\n    \\pi_1^\\star = p^\\star q_1^\\star - c_1(q_1^\\star)^2\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\pi_2^\\star = p^\\star q_2^\\star - c_2(q_2^\\star)^2\n    $$\nThe implementation will apply this complete procedure for each test case provided.",

            "problem": "A distribution-level peer-to-peer platform clears bilateral trades using Distribution Locational Marginal Prices (DLMPs). Consider a single bilateral trade in a radial feeder between a prosumer seller at node $1$ and a consumer buyer at node $2$ during a dispatch interval of length $1$ hour. The distribution system operator computes DLMPs from an optimal power flow using the Lagrangian of nodal power balance with ohmic losses. Assume no congestion binds in this interval. The operator also publishes Marginal Loss Factors (MLFs), which quantify the marginal change in injection at the substation reference bus per unit change in net injection at a node. \n\nTwo settlement designs are considered for this trade of quantity $q$:\n- Lossless settlement (ignoring MLFs): all nodal prices equal the substation energy price, denoted by $\\lambda_{0}$.\n- Loss-aware settlement (incorporating MLFs into DLMPs): nodal prices reflect marginal losses and therefore differ by location.\n\nFundamental base: In a nodal-pricing system, the payment by a buyer at node $j$ is the product of the local nodal price and the metered consumption, and the credit to a seller at node $i$ is the product of the local nodal price and the metered injection. The difference between total buyer payments and total seller credits is the network surplus that funds real losses and residual costs. Marginal loss factors change nodal prices by internalizing the incremental cost of delivering an additional unit of energy to each node through resistive losses; consequently, loss-aware settlement generally increases nodal prices at downstream withdrawals and decreases nodal prices at downstream injections relative to the substation price.\n\nFor the hour under study, assume the following data are reported by the operator:\n- Substation energy price $\\lambda_{0} = 50$ USD/MWh.\n- Trade quantity $q = 6$ MWh from node $1$ (seller) to node $2$ (buyer).\n- Loss-aware DLMPs that incorporate MLFs for this hour are $\\lambda_{1} = 48$ USD/MWh at node $1$ and $\\lambda_{2} = 52$ USD/MWh at node $2$.\n\nTasks:\n- Using the fundamental definitions above, explain how incorporating Marginal Loss Factors (MLFs) into settlement through DLMPs affects location-specific incentives for sellers and buyers in a peer-to-peer market. Your discussion should be qualitative and grounded in marginal-loss cost causality.\n- Then, compute the increase in network surplus when moving from lossless settlement (ignoring MLFs) to loss-aware DLMP settlement (incorporating MLFs) for this single trade.

            "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- System: Distribution-level peer-to-peer platform clearing bilateral trades using Distribution Locational Marginal Prices (DLMPs) in a radial feeder.\n- Trade: A single bilateral trade between a seller at node $1$ and a buyer at node $2$.\n- Interval: Dispatch interval of length $1$ hour.\n- Pricing model: DLMPs computed from an optimal power flow, with no congestion.\n- Definitions:\n    - Marginal Loss Factor (MLF): Marginal change in injection at the substation reference bus per unit change in net injection at a node.\n    - Lossless settlement: All nodal prices equal the substation energy price, $\\lambda_{0}$.\n    - Loss-aware settlement: Nodal prices include marginal losses.\n    - Buyer payment at node $j$: (local nodal price) $\\times$ (metered consumption).\n    - Seller credit at node $i$: (local nodal price) $\\times$ (metered injection).\n    - Network surplus: (total buyer payments) - (total seller credits).\n- Data:\n    - Substation energy price: $\\lambda_{0} = 50$ USD/MWh.\n    - Trade quantity: $q = 6$ MWh.\n    - Seller node: Node $1$.\n    - Buyer node: Node $2$.\n    - Loss-aware DLMPs: $\\lambda_{1} = 48$ USD/MWh (at node $1$) and $\\lambda_{2} = 52$ USD/MWh (at node $2$).\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is assessed against the required criteria.\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on established principles of power system economics, specifically nodal pricing (DLMPs) and the treatment of marginal losses in electricity markets. These are core concepts in energy systems modeling. The provided data, where the seller's price $\\lambda_1$ is below the reference price $\\lambda_0$ and the buyer's price $\\lambda_2$ is above it, correctly reflects the physics of power flow and losses in a radial feeder.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary data and definitions to answer both the qualitative and quantitative parts of the question. The objective is clear and a unique numerical solution exists for the calculation.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, technical language common to the field, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\nThe problem exhibits no flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, or ambiguity. It is a valid, formalizable problem in energy systems analysis.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution is presented in two parts as requested: a qualitative explanation of incentives and a quantitative calculation of the change in network surplus.\n\n**Part 1: Qualitative Explanation of Incentives**\n\nDistribution Locational Marginal Prices (DLMPs) internalize the marginal cost of delivering energy to, or injecting energy from, a specific location (node) in the distribution grid. In a system without binding congestion, the primary driver of price differences between nodes is the marginal cost of ohmic losses.\n\nThe use of DLMPs incorporating Marginal Loss Factors (MLFs) creates price signals that reflect this physical reality, thereby shaping the economic incentives for market participants:\n\n- **Incentives for Sellers (Prosumers)**: A seller's objective is to maximize revenue, which is the product of the quantity sold and the nodal price received. A seller at a downstream node, such as node $1$, who injects power into the grid, helps satisfy local demand. This reduces the amount of power that must be transmitted from the main substation, thus decreasing total system losses. The DLMP at the seller's node, $\\lambda_1$, is related to the substation reference price $\\lambda_0$ by the marginal effect on losses. The fact that $\\lambda_1 = 48$ USD/MWh is less than $\\lambda_0 = 50$ USD/MWh indicates that an additional unit of energy injected at node $1$ displaces slightly less than one unit of generation at the substation due to the complex effects on the network's overall loss profile. The locational price signal incentivizes sellers to site their generation at nodes where they are credited with a higher price. A higher price signifies that an injection at that location has a greater value to the system, typically by being more effective at reducing overall losses. Therefore, sellers are economically encouraged to place generation assets at locations that are most beneficial to grid efficiency.\n\n- **Incentives for Buyers (Consumers)**: A buyer's objective is to minimize cost, which is the product of the quantity consumed and the nodal price paid. To deliver power to a buyer at a downstream node, such as node $2$, energy must flow from the substation and/or other generation sources, incurring resistive losses along the way. The DLMP at the buyer's node, $\\lambda_2$, must therefore account for the cost of the energy itself ($\\lambda_0$) plus the marginal cost of the energy lost in transit. This is why the buyer's price, $\\lambda_2 = 52$ USD/MWh, is higher than the substation price $\\lambda_0$. This price signal directly exposes the buyer to the true marginal cost of their consumption. Consequently, consumers are incentivized to reduce their load or shift their consumption to times or locations with lower DLMPs. This promotes demand-side management that aligns with grid efficiency, encouraging consumption at locations that are electrically \"closer\" to generation sources and less costly to serve.\n\nIn summary, by moving from a uniform \"lossless\" price to location-specific DLMPs, the market provides granular economic signals that align the self-interested behavior of individual participants with the system-wide objective of minimizing energy losses.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Increase in Network Surplus**\n\nThe network surplus, $S$, is defined as the total payments from buyers minus the total credits to sellers. We will calculate this surplus for both settlement designs. The trade involves a quantity $q = 6$ MWh injected by a seller at node $1$ and withdrawn by a buyer at node $2$.\n\n**Case A: Lossless Settlement**\nIn this scenario, the price at all nodes is equal to the substation energy price, $\\lambda_0$.\n- The payment by the buyer at node $2$ is $P_{lossless} = \\lambda_0 \\times q$.\n- The credit to the seller at node $1$ is $C_{lossless} = \\lambda_0 \\times q$.\nThe network surplus under lossless settlement, $S_{lossless}$, is:\n$$S_{lossless} = P_{lossless} - C_{lossless} = \\lambda_0 q - \\lambda_0 q = 0$$\n\n**Case B: Loss-Aware DLMP Settlement**\nIn this scenario, prices are location-specific. The seller at node $1$ receives price $\\lambda_1$, and the buyer at node $2$ pays price $\\lambda_2$.\n- The payment by the buyer at node $2$ is $P_{loss-aware} = \\lambda_2 \\times q$.\n- The credit to the seller at node $1$ is $C_{loss-aware} = \\lambda_1 \\times q$.\nThe network surplus under loss-aware settlement, $S_{loss-aware}$, is:\n$$S_{loss-aware} = P_{loss-aware} - C_{loss-aware} = \\lambda_2 q - \\lambda_1 q = (\\lambda_2 - \\lambda_1)q$$\nThis surplus represents the revenue collected by the distribution system operator to finance the physical energy losses incurred by this specific transaction.\n\n**Increase in Network Surplus**\nThe increase in network surplus, $\\Delta S$, when moving from lossless to loss-aware settlement is the difference between the two surpluses:\n$$\\Delta S = S_{loss-aware} - S_{lossless}$$\n$$\\Delta S = (\\lambda_2 - \\lambda_1)q - 0 = (\\lambda_2 - \\lambda_1)q$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $\\lambda_1 = 48$ USD/MWh\n- $\\lambda_2 = 52$ USD/MWh\n- $q = 6$ MWh\n\n$$\\Delta S = (52 - 48) \\frac{\\text{USD}}{\\text{MWh}} \\times 6 \\text{ MWh}$$\n$$\\Delta S = 4 \\frac{\\text{USD}}{\\text{MWh}} \\times 6 \\text{ MWh}$$\n$$\\Delta S = 24 \\text{ USD}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $24$. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $24.00$.\nThe increase in network surplus is $24.00$ USD.",
