This exercise guides you through the process of calculating the break-even bid price, widely known as the Levelized Cost of Energy ($LCOE$).

            "problem": "A developer participating in a sealed-bid, pay-as-bid renewable energy auction must choose a constant real bid price per megawatt-hour that makes the project just break even in net present value. Assume the project has a single upfront capital expenditure of amount $I_{0}$ at time $t = 0$, delivers a constant expected annual energy output of $E$ for $N$ years starting at $t = 1$, and incurs a constant real fixed annual operation and maintenance cost of $O$ over the same $N$ years. Let the developer’s real Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) be $r$, and assume no escalation, no variable operation and maintenance costs, no curtailment, no subsidies, no tax effects, and zero salvage value at the end of life. The bidder’s break-even bid is the constant real price $p^{\\ast}$ (in currency per megawatt-hour) such that the net present value of discounted net cash flows is zero when discounted at the real WACC.\n\nStarting from the definition of net present value and the time value of money, derive an analytical expression for $p^{\\ast}$ in terms of $I_{0}$, $r$, $O$, $E$, and $N$. Then compute $p^{\\ast}$ for the following scientifically plausible numerical example that characterizes a utility-scale onshore wind farm:\n\n- Upfront capital expenditure: $I_{0} = \\$\\,150{,}000{,}000$ (United States dollars).\n- Real Weighted Average Cost of Capital: $r = 0.06$.\n- Fixed annual operation and maintenance cost: $O = \\$\\,4{,}000{,}000$ per year.\n- Expected annual energy output: $E = 350{,}400$ megawatt-hours per year.\n- Economic life: $N = 25$ years.\n\nExpress the final bid $p^{\\ast}$ in United States dollars per megawatt-hour (USD/MWh). Round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of an analytical expression for the break-even bid price, $p^{\\ast}$, and its numerical calculation for a given set of parameters. The break-even condition is defined as the price at which the net present value (NPV) of all project cash flows is zero.\n\nFirst, we establish the cash flows for the project over its lifetime.\nThe initial capital expenditure at time $t=0$ is an outflow of $I_{0}$. The cash flow at $t=0$ is $CF_{0} = -I_{0}$.\nFor each year $t$ from $t=1$ to $t=N$, the project generates revenue and incurs operation and maintenance (O&M) costs.\nThe annual revenue is the product of the constant real price $p^{\\ast}$ and the constant expected annual energy output $E$. Thus, the annual revenue is $R_t = p^{\\ast} E$.\nThe annual O&M cost is given as a constant real value $O$.\nThe net cash flow for any year $t$ in the operational period ($1 \\le t \\le N$) is constant and given by:\n$$CF_t = R_t - O = p^{\\ast}E - O \\quad \\text{for } t=1, 2, \\dots, N$$\n\nThe Net Present Value (NPV) of the project is the sum of all discounted cash flows over the project's life, from $t=0$ to $t=N$. The discount rate is the real Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), denoted by $r$. The general formula for NPV is:\n$$NPV = \\sum_{t=0}^{N} \\frac{CF_t}{(1+r)^t}$$\nSubstituting the specific cash flows for this project:\n$$NPV = CF_0 + \\sum_{t=1}^{N} \\frac{CF_t}{(1+r)^t} = -I_0 + \\sum_{t=1}^{N} \\frac{p^{\\ast}E - O}{(1+r)^t}$$\nThe break-even condition requires that $NPV = 0$.\n$$0 = -I_0 + \\sum_{t=1}^{N} \\frac{p^{\\ast}E - O}{(1+r)^t}$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for $p^{\\ast}$:\n$$I_0 = \\sum_{t=1}^{N} \\frac{p^{\\ast}E - O}{(1+r)^t}$$\nSince the annual net cash flow term $(p^{\\ast}E - O)$ is constant for all years $t=1, \\dots, N$, it can be factored out of the summation:\n$$I_0 = (p^{\\ast}E - O) \\sum_{t=1}^{N} \\frac{1}{(1+r)^t}$$\nThe summation term is a finite geometric series with first term $a = \\frac{1}{1+r}$, common ratio $q = \\frac{1}{1+r}$, and $N$ terms. The sum of a finite geometric series is given by $S_N = a \\frac{1-q^N}{1-q}$.\nApplying this formula to our summation:\n$$\\sum_{t=1}^{N} \\left(\\frac{1}{1+r}\\right)^t = \\frac{1}{1+r} \\frac{1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+r}\\right)^N}{1 - \\frac{1}{1+r}} = \\frac{1}{1+r} \\frac{1 - (1+r)^{-N}}{\\frac{1+r-1}{1+r}} = \\frac{1-(1+r)^{-N}}{r}$$\nThis expression is the Present Value Interest Factor for an Annuity (PVIFA), often denoted as $A(r, N)$.\nSubstituting this back into our equation for $I_0$:\n$$I_0 = (p^{\\ast}E - O) \\left( \\frac{1-(1+r)^{-N}}{r} \\right)$$\nNow, we solve for $p^{\\ast}$. First, isolate the term $(p^{\\ast}E - O)$:\n$$p^{\\ast}E - O = I_0 \\left( \\frac{r}{1-(1+r)^{-N}} \\right)$$\nThe term $\\frac{r}{1-(1+r)^{-N}}$ is known as the Capital Recovery Factor (CRF). It annualizes the initial investment $I_0$ over $N$ years at a discount rate $r$.\nNext, we add $O$ to both sides and then divide by $E$:\n$$p^{\\ast}E = O + I_0 \\left( \\frac{r}{1-(1+r)^{-N}} \\right)$$\n$$p^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{E} \\left( O + I_0 \\frac{r}{1-(1+r)^{-N}} \\right)$$\nThis is the analytical expression for the break-even bid price $p^{\\ast}$. This expression is equivalent to the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) under the given assumptions. It represents the total annualized cost (O&M plus annualized capital cost) divided by the annual energy output.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value for $p^{\\ast}$ using the provided data:\n-   $I_{0} = 150,000,000$\n-   $r = 0.06$\n-   $O = 4,000,000$\n-   $E = 350,400$\n-   $N = 25$\n\nFirst, we calculate the term $(1+r)^{-N}$:\n$$(1+r)^{-N} = (1.06)^{-25}$$\nUsing a calculator for precision, $(1.06)^{25} \\approx 4.29187075$, so $(1.06)^{-25} \\approx 0.232997365$.\n\nNext, we calculate the Capital Recovery Factor (CRF):\n$$\\text{CRF} = \\frac{r}{1-(1+r)^{-N}} = \\frac{0.06}{1 - 0.232997365} = \\frac{0.06}{0.767002635} \\approx 0.0782268797$$\n\nNow, we can find the annualized capital cost:\n$$\\text{Annualized Capital Cost} = I_0 \\times \\text{CRF} = 150,000,000 \\times 0.0782268797 \\approx 11,734,031.95$$\nThe total annualized cost is the sum of the annualized capital cost and the annual O&M cost:\n$$\\text{Total Annualized Cost} = O + (I_0 \\times \\text{CRF}) = 4,000,000 + 11,734,031.95 = 15,734,031.95$$\nFinally, we calculate $p^{\\ast}$ by dividing the total annualized cost by the annual energy output:\n$$p^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\text{Total Annualized Cost}}{E} = \\frac{15,734,031.95}{350,400} \\approx 44.9030592$$\nThe problem requires rounding the answer to four significant figures.\n$$p^{\\ast} \\approx 44.90$$\nThe units are United States dollars per megawatt-hour (USD/MWh).",

            "problem": "A renewable energy procurement agency runs a sealed-bid, pay-as-bid reverse auction to procure one unit of capacity from a set of $n$ risk-neutral generators. Each generator $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,n\\}$ has a private, independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) marginal cost $c_i$ drawn from the uniform distribution on $[0,1]$. Each generator observes its own cost $c$ and submits a bid $b$, interpreted as the price at which it is willing to supply one unit.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the symmetric Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (BNE) bidding strategy in a sealed-bid, pay-as-bid reverse auction. We are given $n$ risk-neutral generators, each with a private marginal cost $c_i$ drawn independently and identically from a uniform distribution on the interval $[0,1]$. Let $b(c)$ denote the symmetric, strictly increasing, and differentiable bidding strategy that all generators are assumed to follow.\n\nA generator with cost $c$ who submits a bid $b$ earns a profit of $\\pi = b - c$ if it wins the auction and $\\pi = 0$ if it loses. The auction is awarded to the generator with the lowest bid. Therefore, a generator with cost $c$ chooses a bid $b$ to maximize its expected profit:\n$$\nE[\\pi(b,c)] = (b - c) \\cdot P(\\text{winning with bid } b)\n$$\nA bidder wins if its bid $b$ is lower than the bids of all other $n-1$ competitors. Let the bid of a competitor $j$ be $b_j = b(c_j)$. The winning condition is $b < b_j$ for all $j \\in \\{1,\\dots,n-1\\}$. Since $b(c)$ is strictly increasing, it has a well-defined inverse function $c(b) = b^{-1}(b)$. The condition $b < b(c_j)$ is equivalent to $c(b) < c_j$.\n\nThe costs $c_j$ are i.i.d. from the uniform distribution on $[0,1]$, for which the cumulative distribution function (CDF) is $F(x) = x$ for $x \\in [0,1]$. The probability that a single competitor $j$ has a cost greater than $c(b)$ is:\n$$\nP(c_j > c(b)) = 1 - P(c_j \\le c(b)) = 1 - F(c(b)) = 1 - c(b)\n$$\nSince the competitors' costs are independent, the probability of winning with a bid $b$ is the probability that all $n-1$ competitors have costs greater than $c(b)$:\n$$\nP(\\text{winning with bid } b) = [1 - c(b)]^{n-1}\n$$\nIn a symmetric BNE, a bidder with cost $c$ must find it optimal to bid $b(c)$. This implies that the bidder's expected profit is maximized by \"truthfully\" reporting their type $c$ to the bidding function. Consider a bidder with true cost $c$ who considers bidding as if their cost were $\\hat{c}$, thus submitting the bid $b(\\hat{c})$. Their expected profit is:\n$$\nE[\\pi(\\hat{c}, c)] = (b(\\hat{c}) - c) \\cdot P(\\text{winning with bid } b(\\hat{c}))\n$$\nThe probability of winning depends on the bid $b(\\hat{c})$, which in turn depends on the declared type $\\hat{c}$. The probability of winning with bid $b(\\hat{c})$ is $[1 - F(\\hat{c})]^{n-1} = (1 - \\hat{c})^{n-1}$.\nThe expected profit function is:\n$$\nE[\\pi(\\hat{c}, c)] = (b(\\hat{c}) - c)(1 - \\hat{c})^{n-1}\n$$\nFor an equilibrium to exist, each type $c$ must find it optimal to choose $\\hat{c} = c$.

The integral on the right-hand side can be solved using integration by parts, $\\int u dv = uv - \\int v du$. Let $u=c$ and $dv = -(n-1)(1-c)^{n-2}dc$.

A bidder with the highest possible cost, $c=1$, has a zero probability of winning against any competitor (since $c_j < 1$ with probability $1$). To avoid a loss, this bidder's optimal strategy is to bid their cost, $b(1)=1$, ensuring zero profit. Applying this condition, as $c \\to 1$, the left-hand side and the first two terms on the right-hand side go to zero (for $n \\ge 2$). This implies $K=0$.\n\nWith $K=0$, we have:\n$$\nb(c)(1-c)^{n-1} = c(1-c)^{n-1} + \\frac{(1-c)^n}{n}\n$$\nDividing by $(1-c)^{n-1}$ for $c \\in [0,1)$ yields the unique symmetric equilibrium bidding function:\n$$\nb(c) = c + \\frac{1-c}{n}\n$$\nThis expression can be rewritten as $b(c) = \\frac{n-1}{n}c + \\frac{1}{n}$.\n\nFinally, we verify the properties of this solution as requested.\n1.  **Monotonicity**: The derivative of the bid function with respect to cost is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{db}{dc} = \\frac{d}{dc}\\left(c + \\frac{1-c}{n}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{n-1}{n}\n    $$\n    For any auction with $n \\ge 2$ competitors, this derivative is positive. Thus, $b(c)$ is a strictly increasing function of $c$, which confirms our initial assumption. A higher cost leads to a higher bid.\n2.  **Boundary Behavior**:\n    -   At the lower cost boundary, $c=0$, the bid is $b(0) = 0 + \\frac{1-0}{n} = \\frac{1}{n}$. A bidder with zero cost adds a markup that decreases as the number of competitors $n$ increases, reflecting increased competitive pressure. This is economically sensible.\n    -   At the upper cost boundary, $c=1$, the bid is $b(1) = 1 + \\frac{1-1}{n} = 1$. The highest-cost bidder bids their true cost, ensuring they do not make a loss in the zero-probability event that they win. This aligns with rational economic behavior.\n\nThe derived function satisfies all requirements of the problem.",
