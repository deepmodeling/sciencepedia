We will compute this total cost using two methods.\n\n#### 1. Priority List (PL) Heuristic Schedule and Cost\n\nThe PL heuristic ranks units by ascending linear marginal cost, $\\beta_i$.\n- Unit A: $\\beta_{A}=10$ $/MWh.\n- Unit B: $\\beta_{B}=30$ $/MWh.\nThe priority list is therefore (A, B). For each period, we commit the minimum set of units from this list needed to feasibly supply the demand $D_t$.\n\n**Period $t=1$: $D_1=60$ MW**\n- Check Unit A (top of list): Its minimum output is $P_{A}^{\\min}=100$ MW, which is greater than the demand $D_1=60$ MW. Unit A cannot be on alone.\n- Check Unit B (next on list): Its operating range is $[P_{B}^{\\min}, P_{B}^{\\max}] = [50, 120]$ MW. Since $50 \\leq 60 \\leq 120$, Unit B can meet the demand alone.\n- Commitment: $u_{A,1}=0$, $u_{B,1}=1$. Dispatch: $P_{A,1}=0$, $P_{B,1}=60$ MW.\n- Cost for $t=1$: Unit B starts up ($u_{B,0}=0 \\to u_{B,1}=1$), so $y_{B,1}=1$.\n  $$C_1 = (\\alpha_B u_{B,1} + \\beta_B P_{B,1}) + S_B y_{B,1} = (50 \\times 1 + 30 \\times 60) + 1500 \\times 1 = 50 + 1800 + 1500 = \\$3350$$\n\n**Period $t=2$: $D_2=160$ MW**\n- Check Unit A: Its range is $[100, 200]$ MW. Since $100 \\leq 160 \\leq 200$, Unit A can meet the demand alone. This is a minimal set.\n- Commitment: $u_{A,2}=1$, $u_{B,2}=0$. Dispatch: $P_{A,2}=160$ MW, $P_{B,2}=0$.\n- Cost for $t=2$: Unit A starts up ($u_{A,1}=0 \\to u_{A,2}=1$), so $y_{A,2}=1$. Unit B shuts down.\n  $$C_2 = (\\alpha_A u_{A,2} + \\beta_A P_{A,2}) + S_A y_{A,2} = (400 \\times 1 + 10 \\times 160) + 3000 \\times 1 = 400 + 1600 + 3000 = \\$5000$$\n\n**Period $t=3$: $D_3=60$ MW**\n- The logic is identical to Period 1. Unit A alone is infeasible. Unit B alone is feasible.\n- Commitment: $u_{A,3}=0$, $u_{B,3}=1$. Dispatch: $P_{A,3}=0$, $P_{B,3}=60$ MW.\n- Cost for $t=3$: Unit B starts up again ($u_{B,2}=0 \\to u_{B,3}=1$), so $y_{B,3}=1$.\n  $$C_3 = (\\alpha_B u_{B,3} + \\beta_B P_{B,3}) + S_B y_{B,3} = (50 \\times 1 + 30 \\times 60) + 1500 \\times 1 = 50 + 1800 + 1500 = \\$3350$$\n\n**Total PL Cost**:\n$$C_{\\text{PL}} = C_1 + C_2 + C_3 = 3350 + 5000 + 3350 = \\$11700$$\n\n#### 2. Dynamic Programming (DP) Optimal Schedule and Cost\n\nDP finds the minimum cost path over the time horizon. The state is the on/off status of the two units, $(u_A, u_B)$. There are $2^2=4$ states: $S_0=(0,0)$, $S_1=(0,1)$, $S_2=(1,0)$, $S_3=(1,1)$. Let $F_t(S)$ be the minimum cumulative cost to reach state $S$ at time $t$. The initial state is $S_0=(0,0)$ at $t=0$ with $F_0(S_0)=0$.\n\n**Stage $t=1$: $D_1=60$ MW**\n- From $F_0(0,0)=0$.\n- Feasibility: State $(0,1)$ is feasible as $50 \\le 60 \\le 120$. States $(1,0)$ and $(1,1)$ are infeasible as their minimum generation ($100$ and $150$ MW respectively) exceeds the demand.\n- To State $(0,1)$: Unit B starts up ($y_{B,1}=1$). Dispatch is $P_{B,1}=60$.\n  - Stage cost = $(\\alpha_B + \\beta_B P_{B,1}) + S_B = (50 + 30 \\times 60) + 1500 = 1850 + 1500 = 3350$.\n  - $F_1(0,1) = F_0(0,0) + 3350 = 3350$.\n\n**Stage $t=2$: $D_2=160$ MW**\n- Start from $F_1(0,1)=3350$.\n- Feasibility: State $(0,1)$ is infeasible as $D_2=160  P_B^{\\max}=120$. States $(1,0)$ and $(1,1)$ are feasible.\n- Path to State $(1,0)$: Unit A starts up ($y_{A,2}=1$), B shuts down. Dispatch $P_{A,2}=160$.\n  - Stage cost = $(\\alpha_A + \\beta_A P_{A,2}) + S_A = (400 + 10 \\times 160) + 3000 = 2000 + 3000 = 5000$.\n  - Cumulative cost: $F_2(1,0) = F_1(0,1) + 5000 = 3350 + 5000 = 8350$.\n- Path to State $(1,1)$: Unit A starts up ($y_{A,2}=1$), B stays on. Demand $D_2=160$.\n  - Economic Dispatch for $(1,1)$: To minimize $10 P_A + 30 P_B$ subject to $P_A+P_B=160$, $100 \\le P_A \\le 200$, $50 \\le P_B \\le 120$. Since $\\beta_A\\beta_B$, we maximize $P_A$. The constraint on $P_B$ implies $P_B = 160 - P_A$, so $50 \\le 160 - P_A \\le 120$, which gives $P_A \\in [40, 110]$. Combined with $P_A \\in [100, 200]$, the feasible range for $P_A$ is $[100, 110]$. Maximizing $P_A$ gives $P_A=110, P_B=50$.\n  - Stage cost = $(\\alpha_A + \\alpha_B + \\beta_A P_A + \\beta_B P_B) + S_A = (400+50+10 \\times 110+30 \\times 50) + 3000 = (450+1100+1500) + 3000 = 3050+3000 = 6050$.\n  - Cumulative cost: $F_2(1,1) = F_1(0,1) + 6050 = 3350 + 6050 = 9400$.\n\n**Stage $t=3$: $D_3=60$ MW**\n- Feasibility: Only state $(0,1)$ is feasible. We calculate the cost to reach this state from the states at $t=2$.\n- From State $(1,0)$ (cumulative cost $8350$): B starts up ($y_{B,3}=1$), A shuts down. Dispatch $P_{B,3}=60$.\n  - Stage cost = $(\\alpha_B + \\beta_B P_{B,3}) + S_B = (50 + 30 \\times 60) + 1500 = 1850 + 1500 = 3350$.\n  - Total cost path 1: $8350 + 3350 = 11700$.\n- From State $(1,1)$ (cumulative cost $9400$): B stays on ($y_{B,3}=0$), A shuts down. Dispatch $P_{B,3}=60$.\n  - Stage cost = $(\\alpha_B + \\beta_B P_{B,3}) + S_B y_{B,3} = (50 + 30 \\times 60) + 0 = 1850$.\n  - Total cost path 2: $9400 + 1850 = 11250$.\n\n**Total DP Cost**:\nThe minimum cost at the end of the horizon is the minimum of all possible paths.\n$$C_{\\text{DP}} = \\min(11700, 11250) = \\$11250$$\nThe optimal schedule is $(0,1)\\to(1,1)\\to(0,1)$. This path keeps Unit B online in period 2, incurring higher production cost but avoiding a re-start cost in period 3.\n\n#### 3. Cost Gap\n\nThe cost gap is the difference between the total cost of the PL heuristic and the DP optimal method.\n$$\\text{Cost Gap} = C_{\\text{PL}} - C_{\\text{DP}} = 11700 - 11250 = 450$$",
