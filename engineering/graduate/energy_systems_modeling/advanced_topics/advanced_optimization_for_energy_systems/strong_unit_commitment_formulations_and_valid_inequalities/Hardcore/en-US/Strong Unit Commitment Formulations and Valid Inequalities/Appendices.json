            "problem": "Consider a single thermal generating unit in a unit commitment model. Let the binary commitment variable be $u_t \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and let the real-valued power output be $p_t \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}$. The unit has a technical minimum power $P^{\\min}$ and a technical maximum power $P^{\\max}$. A strong on/off linking formulation for the convex hull of the feasible operating set employs linear inequalities that enforce the following fundamental behavior: when the unit is off ($u_t=0$), the output is zero; when the unit is on ($u_t=1$), the output lies within the closed interval bounded by the technical minimum and maximum. In the linear programming relaxation of the unit commitment, the variable $u_t$ is allowed to take fractional values in the interval $[0,1]$, and the same linking inequalities are imposed without the integrality restriction on $u_t$.\n\nGiven $P^{\\min}=50$ MW and $P^{\\max}=200$ MW, do the following:\n- Using only the fundamental definition of the strong on/off linking constraints and standard convex hull reasoning, determine the feasible interval for $p_t$ when $u_t=0$.\n- Determine the feasible interval for $p_t$ when $u_t=1$.\n- In the linear programming relaxation, determine the set of allowed values for $p_t$ when $u_t=0.4$, and explain why those values are allowed under the strong formulation.\n\nFinally, compute the sum of the lower and upper bounds of the feasible interval for $p_t$ when $u_t=0.4$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for an analysis of the relationship between the commitment variable $u_t$ and the power output $p_t$ for a single generating unit. The unit's operating status is defined by the pair of variables $(u_t, p_t)$. The problem specifies the feasible operating points for the true integer model:\n1. When the unit is off, its commitment status is $u_t=0$ and its power output is $p_t=0$. This corresponds to the point $(0, 0)$ in the $(u_t, p_t)$ plane.\n2. When the unit is on, its commitment status is $u_t=1$ and its power output $p_t$ must be between its minimum and maximum generation levels, i.e., $P^{\\min} \\le p_t \\le P^{\\max}$. This corresponds to the vertical line segment $\\{(1, p_t) | P^{\\min} \\le p_t \\le P^{\\max}\\}$.\n\nThe total feasible set for the mixed-integer problem is the union of these two cases:\n$$ S = \\{(0, 0)\\} \\cup \\{ (1, p_t) \\mid P^{\\min} \\le p_t \\le P^{\\max} \\} $$\nThe \"strong on/off linking formulation\" for the linear programming (LP) relaxation is defined by the convex hull of this set $S$. The convex hull, denoted $\\text{conv}(S)$, is the smallest convex set containing $S$. Geometrically, this is the triangle in the $(u_t, p_t)$ plane with vertices at the extremal points of $S$. The vertices are:\n-   $V_0 = (0, 0)$\n-   $V_1 = (1, P^{\\min})$\n-   $V_2 = (1, P^{\\max})$\n\nAny point $(u_t, p_t)$ in this convex hull can be described by a set of linear inequalities. These inequalities define the boundaries of the triangle formed by $V_0$, $V_1$, and $V_2$.\nThe line segment connecting $V_0$ and $V_1$ is described by the equation $p_t = P^{\\min} u_t$. Since the feasible region is above this line, we have the inequality:\n$$ p_t \\ge P^{\\min} u_t $$\nThe line segment connecting $V_0$ and $V_2$ is described by the equation $p_t = P^{\\max} u_t$. Since the feasible region is below this line, we have the inequality:\n$$ p_t \\le P^{\\max} u_t $$\nThe third boundary is the segment from $V_1$ to $V_2$, which is simply $u_t=1$ for $p_t \\in [P^{\\min}, P^{\\max}]$. The two inequalities above are sufficient to describe the feasible region for $u_t \\in [0,1]$. These two inequalities, $p_t \\ge P^{\\min} u_t$ and $p_t \\le P^{\\max} u_t$, are the strong on/off linking constraints.\n\nWe are given $P^{\\min}=50$ MW and $P^{\\max}=200$ MW. The constraints are:\n1. $p_t \\ge 50 u_t$\n2. $p_t \\le 200 u_t$\n\nWe now evaluate the feasible interval for $p_t$ at the specified values of $u_t$.\n\n**Case 1: Feasible interval for $p_t$ when $u_t=0$**\nUsing the fundamental definition, when the unit is off ($u_t=0$), its output must be zero ($p_t=0$). The feasible set is just the single value $\\{0\\}$, which can be represented by the interval $[0, 0]$.\nUsing the derived inequalities:\n-   $p_t \\ge 50 \\times 0 \\implies p_t \\ge 0$\n-   $p_t \\le 200 \\times 0 \\implies p_t \\le 0$\nThese two conditions together imply $p_t=0$. Thus, the feasible interval is $[0, 0]$.\n\n**Case 2: Feasible interval for $p_t$ when $u_t=1$**\nUsing the fundamental definition, when the unit is on ($u_t=1$), its output must be within its technical limits, $p_t \\in [P^{\\min}, P^{\\max}]$.\nUsing the given values, this is $[50, 200]$.\nUsing the derived inequalities:\n-   $p_t \\ge 50 \\times 1 \\implies p_t \\ge 50$\n-   $p_t \\le 200 \\times 1 \\implies p_t \\le 200$\nThese two conditions define the feasible interval for $p_t$ as $[50, 200]$.\n\n**Case 3: Feasible interval for $p_t$ in the LP relaxation when $u_t=0.4$**\nIn the LP relaxation, $u_t$ can be fractional. We substitute $u_t=0.4$ into the strong linking constraints:\n-   $p_t \\ge 50 \\times 0.4 \\implies p_t \\ge 20$\n-   $p_t \\le 200 \\times 0.4 \\implies p_t \\le 80$\nThe set of allowed values for $p_t$ is the interval $[20, 80]$.\n\nThe reason these values are allowed is rooted in the definition of the convex hull. Any point $(u_t, p_t)$ in the relaxed feasible set must be representable as a convex combination of the vertices of the original discrete feasible set, namely $V_0=(0, 0)$, $V_1=(1, 50)$, and $V_2=(1, 200)$.\nA point $(u_t, p_t)$ can be written as:\n$$ (u_t, p_t) = \\alpha_0 V_0 + \\alpha_1 V_1 + \\alpha_2 V_2 $$\nwhere $\\alpha_0, \\alpha_1, \\alpha_2 \\ge 0$ and $\\alpha_0+\\alpha_1+\\alpha_2=1$.\nComponent-wise, this is:\n$$ u_t = \\alpha_0(0) + \\alpha_1(1) + \\alpha_2(1) = \\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 $$\n$$ p_t = \\alpha_0(0) + \\alpha_1(50) + \\alpha_2(200) = 50\\alpha_1 + 200\\alpha_2 $$\nGiven $u_t = 0.4$, we have $\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 = 0.4$. Also, $\\alpha_1 \\ge 0$ and $\\alpha_2 \\ge 0$. We can express $\\alpha_2$ as $\\alpha_2 = 0.4 - \\alpha_1$. Since $\\alpha_2 \\ge 0$, we must have $0.4 - \\alpha_1 \\ge 0$, which implies $\\alpha_1 \\le 0.4$. So, $0 \\le \\alpha_1 \\le 0.4$.\nSubstituting $\\alpha_2$ into the expression for $p_t$:\n$$ p_t = 50\\alpha_1 + 200(0.4 - \\alpha_1) = 50\\alpha_1 + 80 - 200\\alpha_1 = 80 - 150\\alpha_1 $$\nTo find the range of $p_t$, we evaluate it at the extremal values of $\\alpha_1$:\n-   When $\\alpha_1=0$, $p_t = 80 - 150(0) = 80$. This is the upper bound.\n-   When $\\alpha_1=0.4$, $p_t = 80 - 150(0.4) = 80 - 60 = 20$. This is the lower bound.\nAs $\\alpha_1$ varies continuously from $0$ to $0.4$, $p_t$ varies continuously from $80$ down to $20$. This confirms that for $u_t = 0.4$, the feasible set for $p_t$ is indeed the interval $[20, 80]$.\n\n**Final Calculation**\nThe problem asks for the sum of the lower and upper bounds of the feasible interval for $p_t$ when $u_t=0.4$.\n-   Lower bound: $20$ MW\n-   Upper bound: $80$ MW\n-   Sum = $20 + 80 = 100$\n\nThe final numerical answer is $100$.",

No rounding is required and no units are involved.",
            "solution": "The problem asks to derive and apply a strong valid inequality for the minimum down-time constraint.\n\n**Step 1: Derivation of the general inequality**\nThe minimum down-time requirement states that if a unit shuts down at time $t$ (indicated by $y_t=1$), it must remain off for a total of $T^{\\mathrm{down}}$ periods. A shutdown at time $t$ means the unit transitions from on at $t-1$ to off at $t$. The periods it must remain off are therefore $t, t+1, \\dots, t+T^{\\mathrm{down}}-1$. This logical implication is:\n$y_t = 1 \\implies u_{\\tau} = 0$ for all $\\tau \\in \\{t, t+1, \\dots, t+T^{\\mathrm{down}}-1\\}$.\n\nTo formulate this as a single linear inequality relating the status $u_k$ at a time $k$ to recent shutdowns, we consider the contrapositive. If the unit is ON at time $k$ ($u_k=1$), then no shutdown event could have occurred that would force it to be off at time $k$. A shutdown at time $t$ forces $u_k=0$ if $k$ falls within the enforced off-period, i.e., $t \\le k \\le t+T^{\\mathrm{down}}-1$. Rearranging for $t$, this condition is $k-T^{\\mathrm{down}}+1 \\le t \\le k$.\n\nTherefore, if $u_k=1$, it must be that no shutdown occurred at any time $t$ in the interval $[k-T^{\\mathrm{down}}+1, k]$. Since $y_t$ is a binary shutdown indicator, this means:\n$u_k=1 \\implies y_t = 0$ for all $t \\in \\{k-T^{\\mathrm{down}}+1, \\dots, k\\}$.\n\nThis is equivalent to the statement that if $u_k=1$, then the sum of shutdown indicators over that critical window must be zero:\n$u_k=1 \\implies \\sum_{t=k-T^{\\mathrm{down}}+1}^{k} y_t = 0$.\n\nIn any time interval of length $T^{\\mathrm{down}}$, there can be at most one shutdown event, so the sum of binary variables $y_t$ over this window can be at most 1. The logical condition that we cannot have both $u_k=1$ and $\\sum y_t = 1$ simultaneously is captured by the linear inequality:\n$$u_k + \\sum_{t=\\max(1, k-T^{\\mathrm{down}}+1)}^{k} y_t \\le 1$$\nThis is a general strong valid inequality for minimum down-time.\n\n**Step 2: Specialization for the given parameters**\nThe parameters are $T^{\\mathrm{down}}=2$ and time horizon $T=5$. The inequality becomes:\n$$u_k + \\sum_{t=k-1}^{k} y_t \\le 1$$\nwhich expands to:\n$$u_k + y_{k-1} + y_k \\le 1$$\nThis inequality is valid for $k \\in \\{2, 3, 4, 5\\}$.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluation with the given condition**\nWe are given that a shutdown occurs at $t=3$, i.e., $y_3=1$.\n\nTo determine the value of $u_3$, we set $k=3$ in the specialized inequality:\n$$u_3 + y_{3-1} + y_3 \\le 1$$\n$$u_3 + y_2 + y_3 \\le 1$$\nSubstituting the given condition $y_3=1$:\n$$u_3 + y_2 + 1 \\le 1$$\nSubtracting $1$ from both sides gives:\n$$u_3 + y_2 \\le 0$$\nSince the variables $u_3$ and $y_2$ are binary, they are non-negative ($u_3 \\ge 0$ and $y_2 \\ge 0$). The sum of two non-negative variables can be less than or equal to $0$ only if both variables are equal to $0$. Thus, this inequality forces $u_3=0$ and $y_2=0$. The forced value of $u_3$ is $0$.\n\nTo determine the value of $u_4$, we set $k=4$ in the specialized inequality:\n$$u_4 + y_{4-1} + y_4 \\le 1$$\n$$u_4 + y_3 + y_4 \\le 1$$\nSubstituting the given condition $y_3=1$:\n$$u_4 + 1 + y_4 \\le 1$$\nSubtracting $1$ from both sides gives:\n$$u_4 + y_4 \\le 0$$\nSimilarly, since $u_4 \\ge 0$ and $y_4 \\ge 0$, their sum can only be less than or equal to $0$ if both are $0$. This inequality forces $u_4=0$ and $y_4=0$. The forced value of $u_4$ is $0$.\n\nThese results are consistent with the physical meaning of a minimum down-time of $2$: a shutdown at $t=3$ implies the unit must be off for periods $t=3$ and $t=4$, so $u_3=0$ and $u_4=0$.\n\nThe forced values are $u_3=0$ and $u_4=0$. The final answer is the row vector $(u_3, u_4)$.",

This is also an increasing function. Its minimum is approached at the lower end of the interval, $u_1 \\to 0.75^{+}$, with a value of $900(0.75) = 675$.\n\nComparing the minima of the two pieces, the global minimum is $450$, which occurs at $u_1=0.3$.\nThe optimal solution for Case B is: $u_1 = 0.3$, $u_2 = 0.3$, $y_1 = 0.3$. This gives $s_1 = \\max(0, 40(0.3) - 30) = 0$ and $s_2 = 40(0.3) = 12$. So, $p_1=30$ and $p_2=12$.\nThe optimal objective value is $Z_B = 450$.\n\n**Difference Calculation**\n\nThe difference between the optimal objective values is:\n$Z_B - Z_A = 450 - 330 = 120$.\nThe units are in dollars, as specified by the problem.\nThe additional cost in Case B is due to the minimum generation constraint in period $2$. Since $u_1>0$ (to meet demand in period 1) and the min-up-time constraint forces $u_2 \\ge u_1$, $u_2$ must also be positive. With $P^{\\min}=40>0$, this forces generation $p_2 \\ge 40 u_2 > 0$ even with zero demand, incurring a cost. In this case, the extra cost is exactly $c \\cdot p_2 = 10 \\cdot 12 = 120$.",
