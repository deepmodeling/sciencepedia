            "problem": "Consider a high-voltage alternating current transmission system modeled for power-flow and security assessment using the bus-injection sign convention: at any bus, reactive power injection $Q0$ denotes net reactive power supplied to the network (capacitive behavior), whereas $Q0$ denotes net reactive power absorbed from the network (inductive behavior). The system includes the following elements:\n\n- A synchronous generator rated $500\\,\\mathrm{MVA}$ connected at bus $B_1$, operating at $P=400\\,\\mathrm{MW}$ and $V=1.0\\,\\mathrm{p.u.}$, with excitation adjustable between under-excited and over-excited regimes.\n- A $200\\,\\mathrm{km}$ overhead transmission line at $400\\,\\mathrm{kV}$ line-to-line, frequency $50\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, with uniformly distributed shunt capacitance $C=12\\,\\mathrm{nF/km}$ per phase, and typical series reactance such that the line can be either lightly loaded or heavily loaded.\n- A shunt capacitor bank rated $50\\,\\mathrm{MVAr}$ installed at bus $B_2$.\n- A shunt reactor rated $100\\,\\mathrm{MVAr}$, used operationally at light-load conditions to manage overvoltages.\n\nBased on first principles of alternating current power and reactive power in sinusoidal steady state, and the above sign conventions, which of the following statements are correct?\n\nA. Under the bus-injection sign convention, an over-excited synchronous generator (operated at lagging power factor relative to its terminal voltage) has $Q0$ and supplies reactive power; an under-excited generator (leading power factor) has $Q0$ and absorbs reactive power.\n\nB. A long, lightly loaded $400\\,\\mathrm{kV}$ overhead line with $C=12\\,\\mathrm{nF/km}$ per phase will, at $50\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ over $200\\,\\mathrm{km}$, inject approximately $+120\\,\\mathrm{MVAr}$ of reactive power due to line charging, distributed over its terminal buses.\n\nC.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and found to be scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. The provided parameters are realistic for a high-voltage power system. We may now proceed to the analysis of each statement.\n\nThe problem defines the bus-injection sign convention, which is a standard in power flow analysis. At any bus, the net reactive power injection, $Q$, is defined as:\n- $Q > 0$: The bus is a net source of reactive power, injecting it into the network. This corresponds to capacitive behavior.\n- $Q  0$: The bus is a net sink of reactive power, absorbing it from the network. This corresponds to inductive behavior.\n\nWe will evaluate each statement based on this convention and first principles of alternating current power systems.\n\n### Analysis of Statement A\nThis statement concerns the reactive power behavior of a synchronous generator. The reactive power output of a synchronous generator is controlled by its field excitation level.\n- **Over-excited operation**: The field current is increased, leading to a large internal electromotive force ($E_f$). When $E_f$ is sufficiently larger than the terminal voltage $V$, the generator delivers reactive power to the system. This condition is also known as operating with a lagging power factor, where the stator current lags the terminal voltage. Delivering reactive power to the network means injecting it, which corresponds to $Q > 0$ under the bus-injection convention.\n- **Under-excited operation**: The field current is reduced, leading to a small internal $E_f$. When $E_f$ is smaller than $V$, the generator absorbs reactive power from the system. This condition is known as operating with a leading power factor, where the stator current leads the terminal voltage. Absorbing reactive power from the network corresponds to $Q  0$.\n\nThe statement correctly asserts that an over-excited generator (lagging power factor) has $Q>0$ and supplies reactive power, while an under-excited generator (leading power factor) has $Q0$ and absorbs reactive power. This aligns perfectly with the defined sign convention and fundamental generator theory.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n### Analysis of Statement B\nThis statement quantifies the reactive power generated by a transmission line's shunt capacitance. This phenomenon, known as line charging, is particularly significant on long, high-voltage lines, especially under light-load conditions. The total reactive power generated by the line's distributed capacitance can be calculated.\n\nGiven parameters:\n- Line length, $L = 200\\,\\mathrm{km}$\n- Line-to-line voltage, $V_{LL} = 400\\,\\mathrm{kV} = 400 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n- Frequency, $f = 50\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, so angular frequency $\\omega = 2\\pi f = 100\\pi\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$\n- Shunt capacitance per unit length per phase, $C' = 12\\,\\mathrm{nF/km/phase} = 12 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{F/km/phase}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the total capacitance per phase for the entire line:\n$$C_{total, ph} = C' \\times L = (12 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{F/km}) \\times (200\\,\\mathrm{km}) = 2.4 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{F}$$\nThe total three-phase reactive power generated by the line capacitance is given by $Q_{line} = \\omega C_{total, ph} V_{LL}^2$. Let's derive this from the per-phase calculation. The phase voltage is $V_{ph} = V_{LL} / \\sqrt{3}$. The reactive power per phase is $Q_{ph} = \\omega C_{total, ph} V_{ph}^2$. The total three-phase power is $Q_{3ph} = 3 Q_{ph}$.\n$$Q_{3ph} = 3 \\times (\\omega C_{total, ph} V_{ph}^2) = 3 \\omega C_{total, ph} \\left(\\frac{V_{LL}}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2 = 3 \\omega C_{total, ph} \\frac{V_{LL}^2}{3} = \\omega C_{total, ph} V_{LL}^2$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$Q_{line} = (100\\pi\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}) \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{F}) \\times (400 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{V})^2$$\n$$Q_{line} = (100\\pi) \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times (16 \\times 10^{10})\\,\\mathrm{VAr}$$\n$$Q_{line} = 38.4\\pi \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{VAr} = 38.4\\pi\\,\\mathrm{MVAr}$$\n$$Q_{line} \\approx 38.4 \\times 3.14159 \\approx 120.64\\,\\mathrm{MVAr}$$\nThe calculated value is approximately $120.6\\,\\mathrm{MVAr}$. Since the line's capacitance acts as a source, it injects reactive power into the network. According to the sign convention, this injection is positive. Therefore, the reactive power injection is approximately $+120\\,\\mathrm{MVAr}$. The statement that this is \"distributed over its terminal buses\" is consistent with the standard pi-model representation of a medium or long transmission line, where half of the total shunt capacitance is placed at each end of the line model.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n### Analysis of Statement C\nThis statement describes the function and effect of a shunt reactor. A shunt reactor is an inductor connected in parallel (shunt) to the bus.\n- **Function**: Inductors absorb or consume reactive power. A shunt reactor is installed specifically to absorb the excess reactive power generated by line capacitance during light-load conditions, thereby controlling overvoltages (Ferranti effect).\n- **Sign Convention**: Absorbing reactive power from the network is modeled as a negative injection, i.e., $Q  0$. For a $100\\,\\mathrm{MVAr}$ reactor, which is rated by the amount of reactive power it absorbs, the injection at the bus is $Q = -100\\,\\mathrm{MVAr}$.\n- **Voltage Effect**: The absorption of reactive power tends to lower the voltage at the bus. This is the intended effect when used to mitigate light-load overvoltages.\n\nThe statement claims that a shunt reactor produces $Q=+100\\,\\mathrm{MVAr}$ and tends to raise bus voltage. This is incorrect on both counts. It absorbs reactive power ($Q  0$), and it tends to lower bus voltage.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n### Analysis of Statement D\nThis statement concerns the reactive power associated with the series reactance of a transmission line. A transmission line has a series impedance $Z = R + jX$, where $X$ is the series inductive reactance.\n- **Reactive Power Effect**: When current $I$ flows through this reactance, there is a reactive power loss (absorption) given by $Q_{loss} = I^2 X$ per phase. This represents reactive power being consumed by the magnetic field of the line.\n- **Sign Convention**: This consumption is an absorption of reactive power from the network. In the bus-injection model, this effect is not directly modeled as a bus injection but rather as a loss across the series branch. However, if one were to characterize its role, it is clearly a sink of reactive power. If it were to be represented as an equivalent injection, it would be a negative value, $Q  0$.\n\nThe statement claims that the series reactance *produces* reactive power ($Q > 0$). This is fundamentally incorrect. The series inductance of a line always *absorbs* reactive power.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n### Analysis of Statement E\nThis statement addresses the modeling of a shunt capacitor bank. A shunt capacitor bank is installed to provide reactive power support, raising local voltage levels.\n- **Function**: Capacitors are sources of reactive power. A $50\\,\\mathrm{MVAr}$ capacitor bank is rated based on the amount of reactive power it generates or injects into the system at its rated voltage.\n- **Sign Convention**: Injecting reactive power into the network corresponds to $Q > 0$. Therefore, a $50\\,\\mathrm{MVAr}$ capacitor bank is modeled as an injection of $Q = +50\\,\\mathrm{MVAr}$.\n- **Reasoning**: The statement claims the bank is modeled as $Q=-50\\,\\mathrm{MVAr}$ and gives the reason \"because capacitors consume reactive power.\"\n\nBoth the sign and the reason are incorrect. Capacitors supply reactive power, and the correct model is $Q=+50\\,\\mathrm{MVAr}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n### Analysis of Statement F\nThis statement describes the reactive power capability of a large synchronous generator, which is graphically represented by the generator capability curve (or D-curve). This curve outlines the safe operating region in the active power ($P$) versus reactive power ($Q$) plane.\n- **Limits**: The operating region is bounded by several limits: the MVA rating (armature heating), the maximum field current (rotor heating), and the end-region heating/steady-state stability limit.\n- **Asymmetry**: The combination of these physical limits results in an operating region that is asymmetric with respect to the $P$-axis.\n    - The **over-excited (lagging, $Q>0$) region** is limited by the MVA rating and the field heating limit.\n    - The **under-excited (leading, $Q0$) region** is limited by the MVA rating and, more restrictively, by the end-region heating and stability limit.\n- **Consequence**: For a given active power output, such as $P=0.8\\,\\mathrm{p.u.}$, the maximum reactive power that can be supplied (lagging, $Q_{max}$) is significantly greater in magnitude than the maximum reactive power that can be absorbed (leading, $|Q_{min}|$). The typical values cited ($+0.4$ to $+0.6\\,\\mathrm{p.u.}$ versus $-0.2$ to $-0.3\\,\\mathrm{p.u.}$) are representative of real-world turbine generators. This asymmetry correctly implies that generators have a greater capability to provide reactive power support (producing $Q$) than to absorb it.\n\nThe statement provides an accurate qualitative and quantitative description of a key operational characteristic of synchronous generators.\n**Verdict: Correct.**",

The remote grid can be modeled as an ideal infinite bus (zero internal impedance outside the specified elements) supplying the plant bus through the specified series elements. The plant operates near unity power factor under normal conditions. All quantities are positive-sequence, and shunt admittances are neglected.

            "solution": "The problem is validated as being scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard problem in power system analysis, based on fundamental principles of AC circuit theory and the per-unit system. All required data are provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts. First, we compute the Short-Circuit Ratio (SCR) by determining the Thevenin equivalent impedance of the network as seen from the plant bus. Second, we provide a theoretical explanation of the relationship between SCR, voltage stiffness, and reactive power security.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the Short-Circuit Ratio (SCR)**\n\nThe system consists of two parallel transmission lines and a transformer connecting the wind power plant bus to an ideal infinite bus. The Thevenin impedance, $Z_{\\mathrm{th}}$, seen from the plant bus is the series combination of the transformer impedance and the equivalent impedance of the two parallel lines. We are given that series resistance and shunt admittances are negligible, so all impedances are pure reactances.\n\n1.  **Calculate Transmission Line Reactance:**\n    The series reactance of a single transmission circuit is given by the reactance per unit length, $x'$, multiplied by the length, $L$.\n    $$X_{\\mathrm{line}} = x' \\times L = (0.35\\ \\Omega/\\mathrm{km}) \\times (100\\ \\mathrm{km}) = 35\\ \\Omega$$\n    There are two identical circuits in parallel.

To combine it with the line reactance, we must use a consistent system base. Let's choose a system-wide power base, $S_{\\mathrm{base}}$, and voltage base, $V_{\\mathrm{base}}$. A convenient choice is $S_{\\mathrm{base}} = 100\\ \\mathrm{MVA}$ and the nominal line-to-line voltage at the point of connection, $V_{\\mathrm{base}} = V_{\\mathrm{LL}} = 220\\ \\mathrm{kV}$.\n\n    The base impedance, $Z_{\\mathrm{base}}$, at the $220\\ \\mathrm{kV}$ level is:\n    $$Z_{\\mathrm{base}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{base}}^2}{S_{\\mathrm{base}}} = \\frac{(220 \\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{V})^2}{100 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{VA}} = \\frac{48400 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{V}^2}{100 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{VA}} = 484\\ \\Omega$$\n\n    Now, we convert the transformer's per-unit reactance, $x_{\\mathrm{tr,pu}}$, from its own base ($S_{\\mathrm{tr}} = 300\\ \\mathrm{MVA}$, $V_{\\mathrm{tr\\_rated}} = 220\\ \\mathrm{kV}$) to our system base. The formula for changing the per-unit base is:\n    $$x_{\\mathrm{new,pu}} = x_{\\mathrm{old,pu}} \\left( \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{base,new}}}{S_{\\mathrm{base,old}}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{base,old}}}{V_{\\mathrm{base,new}}} \\right)^2$$\n    In our case, $S_{\\mathrm{base,new}} = S_{\\mathrm{base}} = 100\\ \\mathrm{MVA}$, $S_{\\mathrm{base,old}} = S_{\\mathrm{tr}} = 300\\ \\mathrm{MVA}$, and the voltage bases are the same ($220\\ \\mathrm{kV}$).\n    $$x_{\\mathrm{tr,pu}} = 0.10 \\times \\left( \\frac{100\\ \\mathrm{MVA}}{300\\ \\mathrm{MVA}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{220\\ \\mathrm{kV}}{220\\ \\mathrm{kV}} \\right)^2 = \\frac{0.10}{3} \\approx 0.03333\\ \\mathrm{pu}$$\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Thevenin Reactance:**\n    We convert the equivalent line reactance to per-unit on the system base:\n    $$X_{\\mathrm{lines,eq,pu}} = \\frac{X_{\\mathrm{lines,eq}}}{Z_{\\mathrm{base}}} = \\frac{17.5\\ \\Omega}{484\\ \\Omega} \\approx 0.036157\\ \\mathrm{pu}$$\n    The total Thevenin reactance, $X_{\\mathrm{th,pu}}$, is the sum of the transformer and equivalent line reactances, as they are in series:\n    $$X_{\\mathrm{th,pu}} = x_{\\mathrm{tr,pu}} + X_{\\mathrm{lines,eq,pu}} = \\frac{0.10}{3} + \\frac{17.5}{484} = \\frac{1}{30} + \\frac{17.5}{484} = \\frac{484 + 30 \\times 17.5}{30 \\times 484} = \\frac{484 + 525}{14520} = \\frac{1009}{14520}$$\n    $$X_{\\mathrm{th,pu}} \\approx 0.069490358\\ \\mathrm{pu}$$\n    The Thevenin impedance is $Z_{\\mathrm{th,pu}} = jX_{\\mathrm{th,pu}}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate Short-Circuit Apparent Power ($S_{\\mathrm{sc}}$):**\n    The three-phase short-circuit apparent power at a bus is defined as the apparent power that would flow into a bolted three-phase fault at that bus, assuming a pre-fault voltage of $1.0\\ \\mathrm{pu}$. The short-circuit current in per-unit is $I_{\\mathrm{sc,pu}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{pre-fault,pu}}}{|Z_{\\mathrm{th,pu}}|} = \\frac{1.0}{X_{\\mathrm{th,pu}}}$. The short-circuit apparent power in per-unit is $S_{\\mathrm{sc,pu}} = V_{\\mathrm{pre-fault,pu}} \\times I_{\\mathrm{sc,pu}} = \\frac{1.0}{X_{\\mathrm{th,pu}}}$.\n    To find the value in MVA, we multiply by the base power:\n    $$S_{\\mathrm{sc}} = S_{\\mathrm{sc,pu}} \\times S_{\\mathrm{base}} = \\frac{1}{X_{\\mathrm{th,pu}}} \\times S_{\\mathrm{base}} = \\frac{14520}{1009} \\times 100\\ \\mathrm{MVA} \\approx 1439.05\\ \\mathrm{MVA}$$\n\n5.  **Calculate Short-Circuit Ratio (SCR):**\n    The SCR is defined as the ratio of the short-circuit apparent power to the plant's rated active power, $P_{\\mathrm{rated}}$.\n    $$\\mathrm{SCR} = \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{sc}}}{P_{\\mathrm{rated}}} = \\frac{1439.05\\ \\mathrm{MVA}}{250\\ \\mathrm{MW}} \\approx 5.75619$$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, we get $\\mathrm{SCR} = 5.756$.\n\n**Part 2: Relationship between SCR, Voltage Stiffness, and Reactive Power Security**\n\nThe relationship can be derived from the fundamental power flow equations for a two-bus system, representing the plant bus (bus $i$) and the Thevenin equivalent of the grid (bus $k$, the infinite bus). Let $V_i$ and $\\delta_i$ be the voltage magnitude and angle at the plant bus, and $V_k$ and $\\delta_k$ be the Thevenin voltage magnitude and angle. The grid connection is represented by the Thevenin reactance $X_{\\mathrm{th}}$.\n\nThe equations for active power ($P_i$) and reactive power ($Q_i$) injected from the plant bus into the grid are:\n$$P_i = \\frac{V_i V_k}{X_{\\mathrm{th}}} \\sin(\\delta_i - \\delta_k)$$\n$$Q_i = \\frac{V_i^2}{X_{\\mathrm{th}}} - \\frac{V_i V_k}{X_{\\mathrm{th}}} \\cos(\\delta_i - \\delta_k)$$\n\nWe linearize these equations around a typical operating point where $V_i \\approx V_k \\approx 1.0\\ \\mathrm{pu}$ and the angle difference $\\delta = \\delta_i - \\delta_k$ is small. This implies $\\sin\\delta \\approx \\delta$ and $\\cos\\delta \\approx 1$. The equations approximate to:\n$$P_i \\approx \\frac{V_i V_k}{X_{\\mathrm{th}}} \\delta$$\n$$Q_i \\approx \\frac{V_i^2 - V_i V_k}{X_{\\mathrm{th}}} = \\frac{V_i(V_i - V_k)}{X_{\\mathrm{th}}}$$\n\nVoltage stiffness is interpreted as the sensitivity of voltage magnitude to reactive power injection, i.e., the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial V_i}{\\partial Q_i}$. This is a diagonal element of the inverse of the power-flow Jacobian matrix. Using the fast-decoupled power flow approximation, the change in reactive power is primarily linked to the change in voltage magnitude. We can find this sensitivity by differentiating the reactive power equation with respect to $V_i$ while holding other variables constant:\n$$\\frac{\\partial Q_i}{\\partial V_i} = \\frac{2V_i - V_k\\cos\\delta}{X_{\\mathrm{th}}}$$\nAt our linearization point ($V_i \\approx V_k \\approx 1.0\\ \\mathrm{pu}$, $\\cos\\delta \\approx 1$), this becomes:\n$$\\frac{\\partial Q_i}{\\partial V_i} \\approx \\frac{2(1) - 1(1)}{X_{\\mathrm{th}}} = \\frac{1}{X_{\\mathrm{th}}}$$\nFor small deviations, we can write $\\Delta Q_i \\approx \\frac{1}{X_{\\mathrm{th}}} \\Delta V_i$. The voltage sensitivity is therefore:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta V_i}{\\Delta Q_i} \\approx X_{\\mathrm{th}}$$\nThis crucial result shows that the change in per-unit voltage at the connection point is approximately equal to the per-unit Thevenin reactance multiplied by the change in per-unit reactive power injection.\n\nThe connection to SCR is established by its definition. The short-circuit power in per-unit is $S_{\\mathrm{sc,pu}} = 1/X_{\\mathrm{th,pu}}$. Thus, $X_{\\mathrm{th,pu}} = 1/S_{\\mathrm{sc,pu}}$. If we choose the plant's rating $P_{\\mathrm{rated}}$ as the MVA base (i.e., $S_{\\mathrm{base}} = P_{\\mathrm{rated}}$), then the per-unit short-circuit power is numerically equal to the SCR: $S_{\\mathrm{sc,pu}} = S_{\\mathrm{sc}} / P_{\\mathrm{rated}} = \\mathrm{SCR}$. On this specific base, the Thevenin reactance is:\n$$X_{\\mathrm{th,pu}} (\\text{on plant base}) = \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{SCR}}$$\nSubstituting this into our sensitivity relation gives:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta V_i}{\\Delta Q_i} (\\text{in pu on plant base}) \\approx \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{SCR}}$$\n\nThis equation quantitatively links SCR to voltage stiffness:\n- **Voltage Stiffness:** A \"stiff\" grid is one where the voltage is insensitive to changes in power injection. This corresponds to a small value of $\\Delta V_i / \\Delta Q_i$. From the equation, a small sensitivity requires a large SCR.\n- **Reactive Power Security:** Power systems must operate within statutory voltage limits (e.g., $V_i \\in [0.95, 1.05]\\ \\mathrm{pu}$). The relation $\\Delta V_i \\approx \\Delta Q_i / \\mathrm{SCR}$ dictates the permissible range of reactive power injection/absorption ($\\Delta Q_i$) before voltage limits are violated. For a given maximum allowable voltage deviation, $\\Delta V_{\\max}$, the maximum allowable reactive power fluctuation is $|\\Delta Q_{\\mathrm{max}}| \\approx \\mathrm{SCR} \\times \\Delta V_{\\max}$.\n\nA low SCR (a \"weak\" grid) implies a large Thevenin reactance and high voltage sensitivity. This means even small changes in reactive power, perhaps due to plant output variations or grid contingencies, can lead to large voltage deviations, compromising voltage stability and security. Therefore, a higher SCR indicates a stronger connection point, greater voltage stiffness, and wider reactive power security margins.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for an explanation of the Continuation Power Flow (CPF) method in the context of binding security constraints, and for the calculation of a specific tangent predictor vector at a singular point of the power flow equations. The analysis will proceed from first principles.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement. The problem provides a system of algebraic equations $F(x,\\lambda)=0$, where $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ represents the state variables and $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a parameter. It provides the numerical values for the state Jacobian $J = F_{x}(x^{\\star},\\lambda^{\\star})$ and the parameter sensitivity $F_{\\lambda}(x^{\\star},\\lambda^{\\star})$ at a specific point $(x^{\\star},\\lambda^{\\star})$ referred to as the maximum loading nose point. The problem is mathematically well-defined, scientifically grounded, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. It is deemed valid. The provided Jacobian $J$ is singular. This can be verified by observing that its rows are linearly dependent (the third row is twice the first, $R_3 = 2R_1$), which makes the determinant zero.\n\nThe core of the CPF method is to trace the solution manifold of the non-linear algebraic system $F(x, \\lambda) = 0$. This manifold represents the set of all possible steady-state operating points of the power system as the load parameter $\\lambda$ varies. Instead of solving for $x$ at fixed values of $\\lambda$, which fails at the nose point where the solution is not unique locally, the CPF method parameterizes both $x$ and $\\lambda$ by a new independent parameter, typically the arc-length $s$, yielding a curve $(x(s), \\lambda(s))$.\n\nTo find the direction of this curve, we differentiate the equation $F(x(s), \\lambda(s)) = 0$ with respect to $s$ using the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{dF}{ds} = \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} \\frac{dx}{ds} + \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial \\lambda} \\frac{d\\lambda}{ds} = 0\n$$\nLetting $t = [dx/ds, d\\lambda/ds]^{\\top}$ be the tangent vector, the equation becomes $F_{x} (dx/ds) + F_{\\lambda} (d\\lambda/ds) = 0$. This is a linear system of equations for the tangent vector. The CPF algorithm then proceeds via a predictor-corrector scheme. The predictor step involves taking a step of a certain length from the current known solution point in the direction of the tangent vector. The resulting point is an estimate of the next solution. The corrector step then refines this estimate by solving a system of equations to find a nearby point that lies exactly on the solution manifold. The corrector typically solves the original system $F(x,\\lambda)=0$ together with a constraint that forces the solution to be a specific distance from the prediction point, often on a plane perpendicular to the tangent vector.\n\nThe problem states that a reactive power security constraint is binding at the nose point. Let this constraint be $g(x, \\lambda)=0$. In practice, when such a constraint becomes active, the system of equations is augmented to $[F(x,\\lambda); g(x,\\lambda)] = 0$. The Jacobian of this augmented system is generally non-singular, even at the nose point of the original power flow equations $F=0$. This allows the CPF algorithm to smoothly trace the solution path as the system evolves along the constraint boundary. However, the problem directs the analysis to the properties of the original singular system defined by $J = F_x(x^{\\star}, \\lambda^{\\star})$, which corresponds to the tangent of the unconstrained V-Q curve at its turning point.\n\nAt the nose point $(x^{\\star}, \\lambda^{\\star})$, the Jacobian $J = F_{x}(x^{\\star}, \\lambda^{\\star})$ is, by definition, singular. It possesses a non-trivial left null space and right null space. Let $w$ be a non-zero left null vector such that $w^{\\top}J=0^{\\top}$, and let $v$ be a non-zero right null vector such that $Jv=0$. The tangent equation at this point is:\n$$\nJ \\, dx + F_{\\lambda} \\, d\\lambda = 0\n$$\nwhere $dx$ and $d\\lambda$ are the components of the tangent vector. To analyze this system, we pre-multiply by the left null vector $w^{\\top}$:\n$$\nw^{\\top} J \\, dx + w^{\\top} F_{\\lambda} \\, d\\lambda = 0\n$$\nSince $w^{\\top}J=0^{\\top}$, the first term vanishes, leaving:\n$$\n(w^{\\top} F_{\\lambda}) \\, d\\lambda = 0\n$$\nThis is the solvability condition for the linear system. For a generic saddle-node (or fold) bifurcation, which characterizes the nose point, the transversality condition holds, meaning $w^{\\top} F_{\\lambda} \\neq 0$. Consequently, the only way for the equation to be satisfied is if $d\\lambda=0$. This indicates that the tangent to the solution curve at the nose point is \"horizontal\" with respect to the loading parameter axis $\\lambda$.\n\nWith $d\\lambda=0$, the tangent equation simplifies to $J \\, dx = 0$. This means that the state component of the tangent vector, $dx$, must lie in the right null space of the Jacobian $J$. That is, $dx$ must be proportional to the right null vector $v$.\n\nNow we compute these quantities for the given problem. The Jacobian is\n$$\nJ = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1  2  0\\\\\n0  0  1\\\\\n2  4  0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nTo find the right null vector $v=[v_1, v_2, v_3]^{\\top}$, we solve $Jv=0$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nv_1 + 2v_2 = 0 \\\\\nv_3 = 0 \\\\\n2v_1 + 4v_2 = 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe first and third equations are equivalent. From the first, $v_1 = -2v_2$. From the second, $v_3=0$. We can choose a basis vector for the null space by setting $v_2=1$, which gives $v_1=-2$ and $v_3=0$. Thus, a right null vector is $v = [-2, 1, 0]^{\\top}$.\n\nTo confirm the condition $w^{\\top} F_{\\lambda} \\neq 0$, we find a left null vector $w=[w_1, w_2, w_3]^{\\top}$ by solving $w^{\\top}J=0^{\\top}$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nw_1 + 2w_3 = 0 \\\\\n2w_1 + 4w_3 = 0 \\\\\nw_2 = 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nAgain, the first and third equations (in the transposed system) are dependent. We have $w_2=0$ and $w_1 = -2w_3$. Choosing $w_3=1$ gives $w_1=-2$. A left null vector is $w=[-2, 0, 1]^{\\top}$. Now we check the transversality condition with $F_{\\lambda}=[1, 0, 0]^{\\top}$:\n$$\nw^{\\top} F_{\\lambda} = \\begin{bmatrix}-2  0  1\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}1\\\\0\\\\0\\end{bmatrix} = -2 \\neq 0\n$$\nThe condition holds, confirming that at the nose point, $d\\lambda=0$. The tangent direction is therefore spanned by the vector $[v^{\\top}, 0]^{\\top} = [-2, 1, 0, 0]^{\\top}$. Any tangent vector $t$ must be proportional to this direction, so we can write it as $t = k[-2, 1, 0, 0]^{\\top}$ for some scalar $k$.\n\nThe final step is to determine the scalar $k$ using the given normalization condition. The state space component of the tangent vector is $dx = [d\\theta_2, d|V_2|, d|V_3|]^{\\top} = k[-2, 1, 0]^{\\top}$. The normalization is $\\psi^{\\top} dx = 1$, where $\\psi = [1, 0, 0]^{\\top}$.\nApplying this condition:\n$$\n\\psi^{\\top} dx = \\begin{bmatrix}1  0  0\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -2k \\\\ k \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = -2k = 1\n$$\nSolving for $k$ yields $k = -1/2$.\nSubstituting this value of $k$ back into the expression for the tangent vector $t$:\n$$\nt = -\\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThus, the normalized tangent predictor direction $t=\\big[d\\theta_{2},\\,d|V_{2}|,\\,d|V_{3}|,\\,d\\lambda\\big]$ is $[1, -1/2, 0, 0]$.\nThe final answer must be reported as a single row matrix.",
