            "problem": "Consider a high-voltage alternating current transmission system modeled for power-flow and security assessment using the bus-injection sign convention: at any bus, reactive power injection $Q>0$ denotes net reactive power supplied to the network (capacitive behavior), whereas $Q<0$ denotes net reactive power absorbed from the network (inductive behavior). The system includes the following elements:\n\n- A synchronous generator rated $500\\,\\mathrm{MVA}$ connected at bus $B_1$, operating at $P=400\\,\\mathrm{MW}$ and $V=1.0\\,\\mathrm{p.u.}$, with excitation adjustable between under-excited and over-excited regimes.\n- A $200\\,\\mathrm{km}$ overhead transmission line at $400\\,\\mathrm{kV}$ line-to-line, frequency $50\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, with uniformly distributed shunt capacitance $C=12\\,\\mathrm{nF/km}$ per phase, and typical series reactance such that the line can be either lightly loaded or heavily loaded.\n- A shunt capacitor bank rated $50\\,\\mathrm{MVAr}$ installed at bus $B_2$.\n- A shunt reactor rated $100\\,\\mathrm{MVAr}$, used operationally at light-load conditions to manage overvoltages.\n\nBased on first principles of alternating current power and reactive power in sinusoidal steady state, and the above sign conventions, which of the following statements are correct?\n\nA. Under the bus-injection sign convention, an over-excited synchronous generator (operated at lagging power factor relative to its terminal voltage) has $Q>0$ and supplies reactive power; an under-excited generator (leading power factor) has $Q<0$ and absorbs reactive power.\n\nB. A long, lightly loaded $400\\,\\mathrm{kV}$ overhead line with $C=12\\,\\mathrm{nF/km}$ per phase will, at $50\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ over $200\\,\\mathrm{km}$, inject approximately $+120\\,\\mathrm{MVAr}$ of reactive power due to line charging, distributed over its terminal buses.\n\nC. A shunt reactor rated at $100\\,\\mathrm{MVAr}$ connected at the receiving end during light-load periods produces $Q=+100\\,\\mathrm{MVAr}$ and tends to raise bus voltage.\n\nD.

At $P\\approx 0.8\\,\\mathrm{p.u.}$ on a large thermal synchronous generator, the steady-state reactive capability is typically asymmetric: the lagging (producing) limit magnitude exceeds the leading (absorbing) limit magnitude (e.g., $Q$ near $+0.4$ to $+0.6\\,\\mathrm{p.u.}$ versus $-0.2$ to $-0.3\\,\\mathrm{p.u.}$), reflecting field heating and end-region stability constraints; consequently, reactive power support is more available on the producing side than on the absorbing side.\n\nSelect all correct options.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and found to be scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. The provided parameters are realistic for a high-voltage power system. We may now proceed to the analysis of each statement.\n\nThe problem defines the bus-injection sign convention, which is a standard in power flow analysis. At any bus, the net reactive power injection, $Q$, is defined as:\n- $Q > 0$: The bus is a net source of reactive power, injecting it into the network. This corresponds to capacitive behavior.\n- $Q < 0$: The bus is a net sink of reactive power, absorbing it from the network. This corresponds to inductive behavior.\n\nWe will evaluate each statement based on this convention and first principles of alternating current power systems.\n\n### Analysis of Statement A\nThis statement concerns the reactive power behavior of a synchronous generator. The reactive power output of a synchronous generator is controlled by its field excitation level.\n- **Over-excited operation**: The field current is increased, leading to a large internal electromotive force ($E_f$). When $E_f$ is sufficiently larger than the terminal voltage $V$, the generator delivers reactive power to the system. This condition is also known as operating with a lagging power factor, where the stator current lags the terminal voltage. Delivering reactive power to the network means injecting it, which corresponds to $Q > 0$ under the bus-injection convention.\n- **Under-excited operation**: The field current is reduced, leading to a small internal $E_f$. When $E_f$ is smaller than $V$, the generator absorbs reactive power from the system. This condition is known as operating with a leading power factor, where the stator current leads the terminal voltage. Absorbing reactive power from the network corresponds to $Q < 0$.\n\nThe statement correctly asserts that an over-excited generator (lagging power factor) has $Q>0$ and supplies reactive power, while an under-excited generator (leading power factor) has $Q<0$ and absorbs reactive power. This aligns perfectly with the defined sign convention and fundamental generator theory.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n### Analysis of Statement B\nThis statement quantifies the reactive power generated by a transmission line's shunt capacitance. This phenomenon, known as line charging, is particularly significant on long, high-voltage lines, especially under light-load conditions. The total reactive power generated by the line's distributed capacitance can be calculated.\n\nGiven parameters:\n- Line length, $L = 200\\,\\mathrm{km}$\n- Line-to-line voltage, $V_{LL} = 400\\,\\mathrm{kV} = 400 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n- Frequency, $f = 50\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, so angular frequency $\\omega = 2\\pi f = 100\\pi\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$\n- Shunt capacitance per unit length per phase, $C' = 12\\,\\mathrm{nF/km/phase} = 12 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{F/km/phase}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the total capacitance per phase for the entire line:\n$$C_{total, ph} = C' \\times L = (12 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{F/km}) \\times (200\\,\\mathrm{km}) = 2.4 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{F}$$\nThe total three-phase reactive power generated by the line capacitance is given by $Q_{line} = \\omega C_{total, ph} V_{LL}^2$. Let's derive this from the per-phase calculation. The phase voltage is $V_{ph} = V_{LL} / \\sqrt{3}$. The reactive power per phase is $Q_{ph} = \\omega C_{total, ph} V_{ph}^2$. The total three-phase power is $Q_{3ph} = 3 Q_{ph}$.\n$$Q_{3ph} = 3 \\times (\\omega C_{total, ph} V_{ph}^2) = 3 \\omega C_{total, ph} \\left(\\frac{V_{LL}}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2 = 3 \\omega C_{total, ph} \\frac{V_{LL}^2}{3} = \\omega C_{total, ph} V_{LL}^2$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$Q_{line} = (100\\pi\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}) \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{F}) \\times (400 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{V})^2$$\n$$Q_{line} = (100\\pi) \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times (16 \\times 10^{10})\\,\\mathrm{VAr}$$\n$$Q_{line} = 38.4\\pi \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{VAr} = 38.4\\pi\\,\\mathrm{MVAr}$$\n$$Q_{line} \\approx 38.4 \\times 3.14159 \\approx 120.64\\,\\mathrm{MVAr}$$\nThe calculated value is approximately $120.6\\,\\mathrm{MVAr}$. Since the line's capacitance acts as a source, it injects reactive power into the network. According to the sign convention, this injection is positive. Therefore, the reactive power injection is approximately $+120\\,\\mathrm{MVAr}$. The statement that this is \"distributed over its terminal buses\" is consistent with the standard pi-model representation of a medium or long transmission line, where half of the total shunt capacitance is placed at each end of the line model.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n### Analysis of Statement C\nThis statement describes the function and effect of a shunt reactor. A shunt reactor is an inductor connected in parallel (shunt) to the bus.\n- **Function**: Inductors absorb or consume reactive power. A shunt reactor is installed specifically to absorb the excess reactive power generated by line capacitance during light-load conditions, thereby controlling overvoltages (Ferranti effect).\n- **Sign Convention**: Absorbing reactive power from the network is modeled as a negative injection, i.e., $Q < 0$. For a $100\\,\\mathrm{MVAr}$ reactor, which is rated by the amount of reactive power it absorbs, the injection at the bus is $Q = -100\\,\\mathrm{MVAr}$.\n- **Voltage Effect**: The absorption of reactive power tends to lower the voltage at the bus. This is the intended effect when used to mitigate light-load overvoltages.\n\nThe statement claims that a shunt reactor produces $Q=+100\\,\\mathrm{MVAr}$ and tends to raise bus voltage. This is incorrect on both counts. It absorbs reactive power ($Q < 0$), and it tends to lower bus voltage.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n### Analysis of Statement D\nThis statement concerns the reactive power associated with the series reactance of a transmission line. A transmission line has a series impedance $Z = R + jX$, where $X$ is the series inductive reactance.\n- **Reactive Power Effect**: When current $I$ flows through this reactance, there is a reactive power loss (absorption) given by $Q_{loss} = I^2 X$ per phase. This represents reactive power being consumed by the magnetic field of the line.\n- **Sign Convention**: This consumption is an absorption of reactive power from the network. In the bus-injection model, this effect is not directly modeled as a bus injection but rather as a loss across the series branch. However, if one were to characterize its role, it is clearly a sink of reactive power. If it were to be represented as an equivalent injection, it would be a negative value, $Q < 0$.\n\nThe statement claims that the series reactance *produces* reactive power ($Q > 0$). This is fundamentally incorrect. The series inductance of a line always *absorbs* reactive power.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n### Analysis of Statement E\nThis statement addresses the modeling of a shunt capacitor bank. A shunt capacitor bank is installed to provide reactive power support, raising local voltage levels.\n- **Function**: Capacitors are sources of reactive power. A $50\\,\\mathrm{MVAr}$ capacitor bank is rated based on the amount of reactive power it generates or injects into the system at its rated voltage.\n- **Sign Convention**: Injecting reactive power into the network corresponds to $Q > 0$. Therefore, a $50\\,\\mathrm{MVAr}$ capacitor bank is modeled as an injection of $Q = +50\\,\\mathrm{MVAr}$.\n- **Reasoning**: The statement claims the bank is modeled as $Q=-50\\,\\mathrm{MVAr}$ and gives the reason \"because capacitors consume reactive power.\"\n\nBoth the sign and the reason are incorrect. Capacitors supply reactive power, and the correct model is $Q=+50\\,\\mathrm{MVAr}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n### Analysis of Statement F\nThis statement describes the reactive power capability of a large synchronous generator, which is graphically represented by the generator capability curve (or D-curve). This curve outlines the safe operating region in the active power ($P$) versus reactive power ($Q$) plane.\n- **Limits**: The operating region is bounded by several limits: the MVA rating (armature heating), the maximum field current (rotor heating), and the end-region heating/steady-state stability limit.\n- **Asymmetry**: The combination of these physical limits results in an operating region that is asymmetric with respect to the $P$-axis.\n    - The **over-excited (lagging, $Q>0$) region** is limited by the MVA rating and the field heating limit.\n    - The **under-excited (leading, $Q<0$) region** is limited by the MVA rating and, more restrictively, by the end-region heating and stability limit.\n- **Consequence**: For a given active power output, such as $P=0.8\\,\\mathrm{p.u.}$, the maximum reactive power that can be supplied (lagging, $Q_{max}$) is significantly greater in magnitude than the maximum reactive power that can be absorbed (leading, $|Q_{min}|$). The typical values cited ($+0.4$ to $+0.6\\,\\mathrm{p.u.}$ versus $-0.2$ to $-0.3\\,\\mathrm{p.u.}$) are representative of real-world turbine generators. This asymmetry correctly implies that generators have a greater capability to provide reactive power support (producing $Q$) than to absorb it.\n\nThe statement provides an accurate qualitative and quantitative description of a key operational characteristic of synchronous generators.\n**Verdict: Correct.**",

            "problem": "A balanced, single-circuit radial feeder connects a slack substation bus $0$ to a remote bus $1$ hosting a utility-scale Photovoltaic (PV) plant. The system is modeled per-phase using the per-unit (p.u.) system on a three-phase apparent power base $S_{\\text{base}}$ and a line-to-line voltage base $V_{\\text{base}}$. The substation bus $0$ is maintained at a regulated voltage magnitude $|V_{0}| = 1.00$ p.u.

To manage the high real power export scenario, the inverter is required to provide Volt-Ampere reactive (VAR) support through reactive power absorption or injection. Assume that the inverter's reactive power capability is limited by its apparent power rating, i.e., $|Q_{\\text{inj}}| \\leq \\sqrt{S_{\\text{inv}}^{2} - P_{\\text{g}}^{2}}$, and that steady-state operation should be at the upper voltage bound $|V_{1}| = 1.03$ p.u.\n\nStarting only from Ohm's law, Kirchhoff's laws, and the definition of complex power $S = P + j Q$ with the relation $I = \\frac{S^{*}}{V^{*}}$, derive a first-order voltage-power sensitivity relation appropriate for a short, relatively low-loss distribution feeder segment, and use it to compute the magnitude of inverter VAR absorption required to achieve $|V_{1}| = 1.03$ p.u under the given high-$P$ export.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in power system analysis. It contains sufficient and consistent information to derive a unique and meaningful solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute the magnitude of reactive power absorption required by a Photovoltaic (PV) inverter at bus $1$ to maintain the bus voltage magnitude at a specified upper limit, $|V_1| = 1.03$ p.u., under high active power export conditions. The derivation must begin from fundamental principles and lead to a first-order voltage-power sensitivity relation suitable for a distribution feeder.\n\nLet the complex voltages at the substation (bus $0$) and the PV plant (bus $1$) be $V_0$ and $V_1$ respectively. The feeder connecting them has a series impedance $Z = R + jX$. According to Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL), the relationship between the voltages is:\n$$V_0 = V_1 + Z I_{01}$$\nwhere $I_{01}$ is the complex current flowing from bus $0$ to bus $1$. This can be rewritten for the voltage at bus $1$ as:\n$$V_1 = V_0 - Z I_{01}$$\nThe problem defines the complex power injection at bus $1$ from the PV inverter as $S_{1,\\text{inj}} = P_g + j Q_{1,\\text{inj}}$, where $P_g$ is the exported active power and $Q_{1,\\text{inj}}$ is the injected reactive power. The complex power *drawn* from the network at bus $1$ is therefore $S_1 = -S_{1,\\text{inj}}$.\n\nThe complex power drawn at bus $1$ is related to the voltage and current by $S_1 = V_1 I_{01}^*$. We can express the line current $I_{01}$ as:\n$$I_{01} = \\left(\\frac{S_1}{V_1}\\right)^* = \\frac{S_1^*}{V_1^*} = \\frac{(-S_{1,\\text{inj}})^*}{V_1^*} = \\frac{-(P_g - j Q_{1,\\text{inj}})}{V_1^*} = \\frac{-P_g + j Q_{1,\\text{inj}}}{V_1^*}$$\nSubstituting this expression for the current back into the KVL equation:\n$$V_1 = V_0 - (R+jX) \\left( \\frac{-P_g + j Q_{1,\\text{inj}}}{V_1^*} \\right)$$\nThis equation is non-linear due to the $V_1^*$ term in the denominator. To derive the requested first-order sensitivity relation, we introduce approximations appropriate for a short distribution feeder. Firstly, we linearize the equation by approximating the voltage in the denominator with the sending-end voltage, $V_1^* \\approx V_0^*$. The substation bus $0$ is the slack bus, so its voltage angle can be set to zero, making $V_0 = |V_0|e^{j0} = |V_0|$, and thus $V_0^* = |V_0|$. The expression for $V_1$ becomes:\n$$V_1 \\approx V_0 - (R+jX) \\left( \\frac{-P_g + j Q_{1,\\text{inj}}}{|V_0|} \\right)$$\n$$V_1 \\approx |V_0| - \\frac{1}{|V_0|} \\left[ (R+jX)(-P_g + j Q_{1,\\text{inj}}) \\right]$$\nExpanding the complex multiplication:\n$$V_1 \\approx |V_0| - \\frac{1}{|V_0|} \\left[ -RP_g - XQ_{1,\\text{inj}} + j(RQ_{1,\\text{inj}} - XP_g) \\right]$$\nSeparating the real and imaginary parts of $V_1$:\n$$V_1 \\approx \\left( |V_0| + \\frac{RP_g + XQ_{1,\\text{inj}}}{|V_0|} \\right) - j \\left( \\frac{RQ_{1, \\text{inj}} - XP_g}{|V_0|} \\right)$$\nFor a first-order approximation of the voltage magnitude $|V_1|$, we can neglect the small imaginary part, leading to $|V_1| \\approx \\text{Re}(V_1)$. This yields the desired voltage-power sensitivity relation:\n$$|V_1| \\approx |V_0| + \\frac{RP_g + XQ_{1, \\text{inj}}}{|V_0|}$$\nThis equation shows that the voltage magnitude at bus $1$ rises due to the active power export $P_g$ flowing through the line resistance $R$ and is also affected by reactive power injection $Q_{1,\\text{inj}}$ interacting with the line reactance $X$.\n\nNext, we use the given per-unit values to solve for the required reactive power injection, $Q_{1,\\text{inj}}$.\nThe givens are:\n-   Substation voltage: $|V_0| = 1.00$ p.u.\n-   Target bus $1$ voltage: $|V_1| = 1.03$ p.u.\n-   Feeder resistance: $R = 0.05$ p.u.\n-   Feeder reactance: $X = 0.10$ p.u.\n-   Base apparent power: $S_{\\text{base}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{MVA}$.\n-   Inverter active power export: $P_g = 12\\,\\mathrm{MW}$.\n\nThe active power export must be converted to per-unit:\n$$P_{g, \\text{p.u.}} = \\frac{12\\,\\mathrm{MW}}{10\\,\\mathrm{MVA}} = 1.2\\,\\text{p.u.}$$\nSubstituting these values into the sensitivity relation:\n$$1.03 \\approx 1.00 + \\frac{(0.05)(1.2) + (0.10)Q_{1,\\text{inj}}}{1.00}$$\n$$0.03 \\approx 0.06 + 0.10 \\, Q_{1,\\text{inj}}$$\nSolving for $Q_{1,\\text{inj}}$:\n$$0.10 \\, Q_{1,\\text{inj}} \\approx 0.03 - 0.06 = -0.03$$\n$$Q_{1,\\text{inj}} \\approx \\frac{-0.03}{0.10} = -0.3\\,\\text{p.u.}$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the inverter must absorb reactive power to lower the voltage at bus $1$. The magnitude of the required reactive power absorption is $Q_{\\text{abs}} = |-0.3| = 0.3$ p.u.\n\nTo express this value in physical units of $\\mathrm{kVAr}$, we multiply by the base power:\n$$Q_{\\text{abs}} = 0.3 \\times S_{\\text{base}} = 0.3 \\times 10\\,\\mathrm{MVA} = 3\\,\\mathrm{MVAr} = 3000\\,\\mathrm{kVAr}$$\nThe required reactive power absorption is $3000\\,\\mathrm{kVAr}$.\n\nFinally, we check if this requirement is within the inverter's capability.

The formula for changing the per-unit base is:\n    $$x_{\\mathrm{new,pu}} = x_{\\mathrm{old,pu}} \\left( \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{base,new}}}{S_{\\mathrm{base,old}}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{base,old}}}{V_{\\mathrm{base,new}}} \\right)^2$$\n    In our case, $S_{\\mathrm{base,new}} = S_{\\mathrm{base}} = 100\\ \\mathrm{MVA}$, $S_{\\mathrm{base,old}} = S_{\\mathrm{tr}} = 300\\ \\mathrm{MVA}$, and the voltage bases are the same ($220\\ \\mathrm{kV}$).\n    $$x_{\\mathrm{tr,pu}} = 0.10 \\times \\left( \\frac{100\\ \\mathrm{MVA}}{300\\ \\mathrm{MVA}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{220\\ \\mathrm{kV}}{220\\ \\mathrm{kV}} \\right)^2 = \\frac{0.10}{3} \\approx 0.03333\\ \\mathrm{pu}$$\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Thevenin Reactance:**\n    We convert the equivalent line reactance to per-unit on the system base:\n    $$X_{\\mathrm{lines,eq,pu}} = \\frac{X_{\\mathrm{lines,eq}}}{Z_{\\mathrm{base}}} = \\frac{17.5\\ \\Omega}{484\\ \\Omega} \\approx 0.036157\\ \\mathrm{pu}$$\n    The total Thevenin reactance, $X_{\\mathrm{th,pu}}$, is the sum of the transformer and equivalent line reactances, as they are in series:\n    $$X_{\\mathrm{th,pu}} = x_{\\mathrm{tr,pu}} + X_{\\mathrm{lines,eq,pu}} = \\frac{0.10}{3} + \\frac{17.5}{484} = \\frac{1}{30} + \\frac{17.5}{484} = \\frac{484 + 30 \\times 17.5}{30 \\times 484} = \\frac{484 + 525}{14520} = \\frac{1009}{14520}$$\n    $$X_{\\mathrm{th,pu}} \\approx 0.069490358\\ \\mathrm{pu}$$\n    The Thevenin impedance is $Z_{\\mathrm{th,pu}} = jX_{\\mathrm{th,pu}}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate Short-Circuit Apparent Power ($S_{\\mathrm{sc}}$):**\n    The three-phase short-circuit apparent power at a bus is defined as the apparent power that would flow into a bolted three-phase fault at that bus, assuming a pre-fault voltage of $1.0\\ \\mathrm{pu}$. The short-circuit current in per-unit is $I_{\\mathrm{sc,pu}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{pre-fault,pu}}}{|Z_{\\mathrm{th,pu}}|} = \\frac{1.0}{X_{\\mathrm{th,pu}}}$. The short-circuit apparent power in per-unit is $S_{\\mathrm{sc,pu}} = V_{\\mathrm{pre-fault,pu}} \\times I_{\\mathrm{sc,pu}} = \\frac{1.0}{X_{\\mathrm{th,pu}}}$.\n    To find the value in MVA, we multiply by the base power:\n    $$S_{\\mathrm{sc}} = S_{\\mathrm{sc,pu}} \\times S_{\\mathrm{base}} = \\frac{1}{X_{\\mathrm{th,pu}}} \\times S_{\\mathrm{base}} = \\frac{14520}{1009} \\times 100\\ \\mathrm{MVA} \\approx 1439.05\\ \\mathrm{MVA}$$\n\n5.  **Calculate Short-Circuit Ratio (SCR):**\n    The SCR is defined as the ratio of the short-circuit apparent power to the plant's rated active power, $P_{\\mathrm{rated}}$.\n    $$\\mathrm{SCR} = \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{sc}}}{P_{\\mathrm{rated}}} = \\frac{1439.05\\ \\mathrm{MVA}}{250\\ \\mathrm{MW}} \\approx 5.75619$$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, we get $\\mathrm{SCR} = 5.756$.\n\n**Part 2: Relationship between SCR, Voltage Stiffness, and Reactive Power Security**\n\nThe relationship can be derived from the fundamental power flow equations for a two-bus system, representing the plant bus (bus $i$) and the Thevenin equivalent of the grid (bus $k$, the infinite bus). Let $V_i$ and $\\delta_i$ be the voltage magnitude and angle at the plant bus, and $V_k$ and $\\delta_k$ be the Thevenin voltage magnitude and angle. The grid connection is represented by the Thevenin reactance $X_{\\mathrm{th}}$.\n\nThe equations for active power ($P_i$) and reactive power ($Q_i$) injected from the plant bus into the grid are:\n$$P_i = \\frac{V_i V_k}{X_{\\mathrm{th}}} \\sin(\\delta_i - \\delta_k)$$\n$$Q_i = \\frac{V_i^2}{X_{\\mathrm{th}}} - \\frac{V_i V_k}{X_{\\mathrm{th}}} \\cos(\\delta_i - \\delta_k)$$\n\nWe linearize these equations around a typical operating point where $V_i \\approx V_k \\approx 1.0\\ \\mathrm{pu}$ and the angle difference $\\delta = \\delta_i - \\delta_k$ is small. This implies $\\sin\\delta \\approx \\delta$ and $\\cos\\delta \\approx 1$. The equations approximate to:\n$$P_i \\approx \\frac{V_i V_k}{X_{\\mathrm{th}}} \\delta$$\n$$Q_i \\approx \\frac{V_i^2 - V_i V_k}{X_{\\mathrm{th}}} = \\frac{V_i(V_i - V_k)}{X_{\\mathrm{th}}}$$\n\nVoltage stiffness is interpreted as the sensitivity of voltage magnitude to reactive power injection, i.e., the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial V_i}{\\partial Q_i}$. This is a diagonal element of the inverse of the power-flow Jacobian matrix. Using the fast-decoupled power flow approximation, the change in reactive power is primarily linked to the change in voltage magnitude. We can find this sensitivity by differentiating the reactive power equation with respect to $V_i$ while holding other variables constant:\n$$\\frac{\\partial Q_i}{\\partial V_i} = \\frac{2V_i - V_k\\cos\\delta}{X_{\\mathrm{th}}}$$\nAt our linearization point ($V_i \\approx V_k \\approx 1.0\\ \\mathrm{pu}$, $\\cos\\delta \\approx 1$), this becomes:\n$$\\frac{\\partial Q_i}{\\partial V_i} \\approx \\frac{2(1) - 1(1)}{X_{\\mathrm{th}}} = \\frac{1}{X_{\\mathrm{th}}}$$\nFor small deviations, we can write $\\Delta Q_i \\approx \\frac{1}{X_{\\mathrm{th}}} \\Delta V_i$. The voltage sensitivity is therefore:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta V_i}{\\Delta Q_i} \\approx X_{\\mathrm{th}}$$\nThis crucial result shows that the change in per-unit voltage at the connection point is approximately equal to the per-unit Thevenin reactance multiplied by the change in per-unit reactive power injection.\n\nThe connection to SCR is established by its definition. The short-circuit power in per-unit is $S_{\\mathrm{sc,pu}} = 1/X_{\\mathrm{th,pu}}$. Thus, $X_{\\mathrm{th,pu}} = 1/S_{\\mathrm{sc,pu}}$. If we choose the plant's rating $P_{\\mathrm{rated}}$ as the MVA base (i.e., $S_{\\mathrm{base}} = P_{\\mathrm{rated}}$), then the per-unit short-circuit power is numerically equal to the SCR: $S_{\\mathrmspu{sc,pu}} = S_{\\mathrm{sc}} / P_{\\mathrm{rated}} = \\mathrm{SCR}$. On this specific base, the Thevenin reactance is:\n$$X_{\\mathrm{th,pu}} (\\text{on plant base}) = \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{SCR}}$$\nSubstituting this into our sensitivity relation gives:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta V_i}{\\Delta Q_i} (\\text{in pu on plant base}) \\approx \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{SCR}}$$\n\nThis equation quantitatively links SCR to voltage stiffness:\n- **Voltage Stiffness:** A \"stiff\" grid is one where the voltage is insensitive to changes in power injection. This corresponds to a small value of $\\Delta V_i / \\Delta Q_i$. From the equation, a small sensitivity requires a large SCR.\n- **Reactive Power Security:** Power systems must operate within statutory voltage limits (e.g., $V_i \\in [0.95, 1.05]\\ \\mathrm{pu}$). The relation $\\Delta V_i \\approx \\Delta Q_i / \\mathrm{SCR}$ dictates the permissible range of reactive power injection/absorption ($\\Delta Q_i$) before voltage limits are violated. For a given maximum allowable voltage deviation, $\\Delta V_{\\max}$, the maximum allowable reactive power fluctuation is $|\\Delta Q_{\\mathrm{max}}| \\approx \\mathrm{SCR} \\times \\Delta V_{\\max}$.\n\nA low SCR (a \"weak\" grid) implies a large Thevenin reactance and high voltage sensitivity. This means even small changes in reactive power, perhaps due to plant output variations or grid contingencies, can lead to large voltage deviations, compromising voltage stability and security. Therefore, a higher SCR indicates a stronger connection point, greater voltage stiffness, and wider reactive power security margins.",
