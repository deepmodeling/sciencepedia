The resistance, $R_{L}$, of a uniform conductor is fundamentally defined by its resistivity, $\\rho$, its length, $L$, and its cross-sectional area, $A$, as $R_{L} = \\rho \\frac{L}{A}$. The problem concerns quantities per unit length. The resistance per unit length, which we denote as $R$, is therefore $R = \\frac{R_{L}}{L} = \\frac{\\rho}{A}$.\n\nThe problem states to use a first-order approximation for the change in resistance with temperature. This is based on the temperature dependence of resistivity, which for many metals near a reference temperature $T_{0}$ can be modeled linearly:\n$$ \\rho(T) = \\rho(T_0) [1 + \\alpha(T - T_0)] $$\nwhere $\\rho(T)$ is the resistivity at temperature $T$, $\\rho(T_0)$ is the resistivity at the reference temperature $T_0$, and $\\alpha$ is the temperature coefficient of resistance at $T_0$.\n\nSince the problem assumes that geometric changes are negligible, the cross-sectional area $A$ is constant. Consequently, the resistance per unit length $R(T)$ follows the same linear relationship:\n$$ R(T) = R(T_0) [1 + \\alpha(T - T_0)] $$\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Reference temperature, $T_{0} = 293\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n- Resistance per unit length at $T_0$, denoted as $R_{20} = R(T_0) = 0.2\\,\\Omega/\\mathrm{km}$.\n- Temperature coefficient of resistance, $\\alpha = 0.004\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}}$.\n- Operating conductor temperature, $T = 338\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the change in temperature:\n$$ \\Delta T = T - T_0 = 338\\,\\mathrm{K} - 293\\,\\mathrm{K} = 45\\,\\mathrm{K} $$\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values into the equation for $R(T)$:\n$$ R(T) = (0.2\\,\\Omega/\\mathrm{km}) \\times [1 + (0.004\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}}) \\times (45\\,\\mathrm{K})] $$\n$$ R(T) = (0.2\\,\\Omega/\\mathrm{km}) \\times [1 + 0.18] $$\n$$ R(T) = (0.2\\,\\Omega/\\mathrm{km}) \\times 1.18 $$\n$$ R(T) = 0.236\\,\\Omega/\\mathrm{km} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the resistance per unit length is $R(T) = 0.2360\\,\\Omega/\\mathrm{km}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the Joule heat per unit length, $q_j$. The power dissipated as heat in a conductor of resistance $R_L$ carrying a current $I$ is given by Joule's law, $P_J = I^{2}R_{L}$. For alternating current, the current $I$ is the Root-Mean-Square (RMS) value, which is provided in the problem. The Joule heat per unit length is the power dissipation per unit length:\n$$ q_{j} = \\frac{P_J}{L} = \\frac{I^{2}R_{L}}{L} = I^{2} R(T) $$\nwhere $R(T)$ is the resistance per unit length at the operating temperature $T$.\n\nWe are given the current $I = 900\\,\\mathrm{A}$.

This relation connects the change in conductor tension to the change in its temperature. Using this relation, we must compute the minimum ambient temperature $T_{\\min}$ at which the conductor tension reaches its maximum allowable mechanical limit.\n\nThe core principle is that the unstressed length of the conductor is a function of temperature only. Any change in the unstressed length must be due to thermal expansion or contraction. We can express the unstressed length in terms of geometric and mechanical properties and then enforce this condition.\n\nThe shape of a uniformly loaded conductor under gravity is a catenary. For small sag-to-span ratios, this can be accurately approximated by a parabola. The arc length $S$ of the conductor over a span $L$ is:\n$$ S \\approx L + \\frac{w^2 L^3}{24H^2} $$\nwhere $w = mg$ is the weight per unit length of the conductor and $H$ is the constant horizontal component of tension. This equation gives the sagged length of the conductor as a function of the horizontal tension $H$.\n\nThe sagged length $S$ is the result of elastically stretching the conductor's unstressed length. The unstressed length, in turn, depends on temperature. For a conductor at temperature $T$ subjected to an average tension approximated by $H$, the elastic strain is $\\epsilon_e = H/(AE)$. The total length $S$ can be seen as the unstressed length at temperature $T$, denoted $S_u(T)$, elongated by this strain. Since the strain is small, the elastic elongation is approximately $L \\frac{H}{AE}$.

The unstressed length in each state is:\n$$ S_{u,0} \\approx L + \\frac{w^2 L^3}{24H_0^2} - \\frac{LH_0}{AE} $$\n$$ S_{u,1} \\approx L + \\frac{w^2 L^3}{24H_1^2} - \\frac{LH_1}{AE} $$\nThe unstressed length changes only due to temperature, following the law of linear thermal expansion: $S_{u,1} = S_{u,0} \\big(1 + \\alpha(T_1 - T_0)\\big)$. Since $S_{u,0} \\approx L$, the change in unstressed length is:\n$$ S_{u,1} - S_{u,0} \\approx L\\alpha(T_1 - T_0) $$\nSubtracting the two expressions for unstressed length:\n$$ S_{u,1} - S_{u,0} \\approx \\left(\\frac{w^2 L^3}{24H_1^2} - \\frac{LH_1}{AE}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{w^2 L^3}{24H_0^2} - \\frac{LH_0}{AE}\\right) $$\n$$ S_{u,1} - S_{u,0} \\approx \\frac{w^2 L^3}{24}\\left(\\frac{1}{H_1^2} - \\frac{1}{H_0^2}\\right) - \\frac{L}{AE}(H_1 - H_0) $$\nEquating this with the thermal expansion provides the compatibility relation. Dividing by $L$ and solving for the temperature change yields the final form of the change-of-state equation:\n$$ T_1 - T_0 = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\left[ \\frac{w^2 L^2}{24}\\left(\\frac{1}{H_1^2} - \\frac{1}{H_0^2}\\right) + \\frac{H_0 - H_1}{AE} \\right] $$\n\nWe apply this equation to find the minimum temperature $T_{\\min}$.\nThe initial state (state $0$) is given by:\n- $T_0 = 25.0 \\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\n- $H_0 = 19.0 \\times 10^{3} \\,\\mathrm{N}$\n\nThe final state (state $1$) is defined by the tension reaching the allowable limit:\n- $T_1 = T_{\\min}$\n- $H_1 = H_{\\mathrm{allow}}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the constants required:\n- Weight per unit length: $w = mg = (0.900 \\,\\mathrm{kg/m}) \\times (9.81 \\,\\mathrm{m/s^2}) = 8.829 \\,\\mathrm{N/m}$.\n- Allowable horizontal tension: $H_{\\mathrm{allow}} = \\beta \\times \\mathrm{RTS} = 0.250 \\times (120.0 \\times 10^{3} \\,\\mathrm{N}) = 30.0 \\times 10^{3} \\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n- Conductor stiffness: $AE = (3.00 \\times 10^{-4} \\,\\mathrm{m^2}) \\times (70.0 \\times 10^{9} \\,\\mathrm{Pa}) = 21.0 \\times 10^6 \\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the derived equation to solve for $T_{\\min}$:\n$$ T_{\\min} = T_0 + \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\left[ \\frac{w^2 L^2}{24}\\left(\\frac{1}{H_{\\mathrm{allow}}^2} - \\frac{1}{H_0^2}\\right) + \\frac{H_0 - H_{\\mathrm{allow}}}{AE} \\right] $$\nLet's compute the terms inside the brackets.\nThe geometric term:\n$$ \\frac{w^2 L^2}{24}\\left(\\frac{1}{H_{\\mathrm{allow}}^2} - \\frac{1}{H_0^2}\\right) = \\frac{(8.829)^2 (300)^2}{24} \\left(\\frac{1}{(30.0 \\times 10^3)^2} - \\frac{1}{(19.0 \\times 10^3)^2}\\right) $$\n$$ = 2.92317 \\times 10^5 \\left(1.1111 \\times 10^{-9} - 2.7701 \\times 10^{-9}\\right) = 2.92317 \\times 10^5 (-1.65898 \\times 10^{-9}) = -4.8495 \\times 10^{-4} $$\nThe elastic term:\n$$ \\frac{H_0 - H_{\\mathrm{allow}}}{AE} = \\frac{19.0 \\times 10^3 - 30.0 \\times 10^3}{21.0 \\times 10^6} = \\frac{-11.0 \\times 10^3}{21.0 \\times 10^6} = -5.2381 \\times 10^{-4} $$\nThe total change in strain (sum of the two terms) is $-4.8495 \\times 10^{-4} - 5.2381 \\times 10^{-4} = -1.00876 \\times 10^{-3}$.\n\nNow we can find the temperature change $\\Delta T = T_{\\min} - T_0$:\n$$ \\Delta T = \\frac{1}{23.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}}} (-1.00876 \\times 10^{-3}) = -43.859 \\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} $$\nFinally, we calculate $T_{\\min}$:\n$$ T_{\\min} = T_0 + \\Delta T = 25.0 \\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} - 43.859 \\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} = -18.859 \\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the minimum ambient operating temperature is $-18.9 \\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.",
