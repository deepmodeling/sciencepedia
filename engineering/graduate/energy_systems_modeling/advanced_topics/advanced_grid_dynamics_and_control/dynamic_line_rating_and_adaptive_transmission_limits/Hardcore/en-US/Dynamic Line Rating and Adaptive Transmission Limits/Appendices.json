            "solution": "The solution proceeds by first deriving the resistance per unit length at the specified operating temperature and then using this value to calculate the Joule heat generated per unit length.\n\nFirst, we address the temperature dependence of resistance. The resistance, $R_{L}$, of a uniform conductor is fundamentally defined by its resistivity, $\\rho$, its length, $L$, and its cross-sectional area, $A$, as $R_{L} = \\rho \\frac{L}{A}$. The problem concerns quantities per unit length. The resistance per unit length, which we denote as $R$, is therefore $R = \\frac{R_{L}}{L} = \\frac{\\rho}{A}$.\n\nThe problem states to use a first-order approximation for the change in resistance with temperature. This is based on the temperature dependence of resistivity, which for many metals near a reference temperature $T_{0}$ can be modeled linearly:\n$$ \\rho(T) = \\rho(T_0) [1 + \\alpha(T - T_0)] $$\nwhere $\\rho(T)$ is the resistivity at temperature $T$, $\\rho(T_0)$ is the resistivity at the reference temperature $T_0$, and $\\alpha$ is the temperature coefficient of resistance at $T_0$.\n\nSince the problem assumes that geometric changes are negligible, the cross-sectional area $A$ is constant. Consequently, the resistance per unit length $R(T)$ follows the same linear relationship:\n$$ R(T) = R(T_0) [1 + \\alpha(T - T_0)] $$\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Reference temperature, $T_{0} = 293\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n- Resistance per unit length at $T_0$, denoted as $R_{20} = R(T_0) = 0.2\\,\\Omega/\\mathrm{km}$.\n- Temperature coefficient of resistance, $\\alpha = 0.004\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}}$.\n- Operating conductor temperature, $T = 338\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the change in temperature:\n$$ \\Delta T = T - T_0 = 338\\,\\mathrm{K} - 293\\,\\mathrm{K} = 45\\,\\mathrm{K} $$\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values into the equation for $R(T)$:\n$$ R(T) = (0.2\\,\\Omega/\\mathrm{km}) \\times [1 + (0.004\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}}) \\times (45\\,\\mathrm{K})] $$\n$$ R(T) = (0.2\\,\\Omega/\\mathrm{km}) \\times [1 + 0.18] $$\n$$ R(T) = (0.2\\,\\Omega/\\mathrm{km}) \\times 1.18 $$\n$$ R(T) = 0.236\\,\\Omega/\\mathrm{km} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the resistance per unit length is $R(T) = 0.2360\\,\\Omega/\\mathrm{km}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the Joule heat per unit length, $q_j$. The power dissipated as heat in a conductor of resistance $R_L$ carrying a current $I$ is given by Joule's law, $P_J = I^{2}R_{L}$. For alternating current, the current $I$ is the Root-Mean-Square (RMS) value, which is provided in the problem. The Joule heat per unit length is the power dissipation per unit length:\n$$ q_{j} = \\frac{P_J}{L} = \\frac{I^{2}R_{L}}{L} = I^{2} R(T) $$\nwhere $R(T)$ is the resistance per unit length at the operating temperature $T$.\n\nWe are given the current $I = 900\\,\\mathrm{A}$.

This requires combining a physical model of the transmission line's thermal behavior with a stochastic model of the wind speed, which is a key factor in cooling.\n\nFirst, we formalize the condition for an overload. The steady-state heat balance for the conductor at its maximum allowable temperature, $T_{\\max}$, is given by:\n$$\nI^2 R' + Q_{\\mathrm{solar}} = h(u_{\\mathrm{eff}})\\,\\Delta T + k_{\\mathrm{rad}}\\,\\Delta T\n$$\nwhere $I$ is the current, $R'$ is the resistance per unit length, $Q_{\\mathrm{solar}}$ is the solar heat gain per unit length, $h(u_{\\mathrm{eff}})$ is the convective heat transfer coefficient, $k_{\\mathrm{rad}}$ is the linearized radiative heat transfer coefficient, and $\\Delta T = T_{\\max} - T_a$ is the temperature difference between the conductor and the ambient air.\n\nThe convective heat transfer coefficient is modeled as a linear function of the effective wind speed, $u_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\max(u, 0)$:\n$$\nh(u_{\\mathrm{eff}}) = h_0 + k\\,u_{\\mathrm{eff}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the heat balance equation gives:\n$$\nI^2 R' + Q_{\\mathrm{solar}} = (h_0 + k\\,u_{\\mathrm{eff}} + k_{\\mathrm{rad}})\\,\\Delta T\n$$\nThe instantaneous dynamic ampacity limit, $I_{\\lim}(t)$, is the current $I$ that satisfies this equation at time $t$ for a given wind speed $u_{\\mathrm{eff}}(t)$.

This simplifies the simulation, as we only need to compare the generated effective wind speed at each time step against this pre-calculated threshold. Note that since $u_{\\mathrm{eff}}(t) \\ge 0$, if $u_{\\mathrm{eff,crit}} \\le 0$, an overload is impossible, and the probability is $0$.\n\nThe wind speed $u_t$ is modeled by a first-order autoregressive process, AR($1$):\n$$\nu_{t} = \\mu + \\phi\\,(u_{t-1} - \\mu) + \\epsilon_t, \\quad \\epsilon_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_\\epsilon^2)\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the simulation for each trajectory should start with $u_0$ drawn from the stationary distribution of this process.

Store the full matrix of wind speeds $u_{i,t}$ for trajectory $i$ and time $t$. A vectorized implementation is preferred for efficiency. This involves generating all random innovations in advance.\n4.  Convert the wind speeds to effective wind speeds: $u_{\\mathrm{eff},i,t} = \\max(u_{i,t}, 0)$.\n5.  For each of the four test cases:\n    a. Calculate the case-specific value of $\\Delta T$ and then $u_{\\mathrm{eff,crit}}$.\n    b. If $u_{\\mathrm{eff,crit}} \\le 0$, the probability is $0$.\n    c.

Count the number of trajectories for which an overload occurs at least once. Let this be $N_{\\mathrm{overload}}$.\n    e. The estimated interval overload probability is $p = N_{\\mathrm{overload}} / N$.\n6.  The final results for the four cases are collected and formatted as specified.",
