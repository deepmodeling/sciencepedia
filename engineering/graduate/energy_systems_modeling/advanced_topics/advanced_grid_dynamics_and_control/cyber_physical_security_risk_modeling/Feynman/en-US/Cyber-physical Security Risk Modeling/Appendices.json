Due to procurement-phase supply-chain cyber risk, each protective relay in the fleet may be compromised before installation. Consider the following scientifically grounded assumptions:\n\n- There are $N=50$ protective relays in service during a fixed critical disturbance window.\n- Each relay is compromised during procurement with probability $p=0.04$, independently across relays, forming independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Bernoulli trials.\n- Conditional on its compromise state, each relay may misoperate during the disturbance window, independently of other relays:\n  - If compromised, a relay misoperates with probability $s=0.15$.\n  - If uncompromised, a relay misoperates with probability $u=0.003$.\n- The system failure event is defined as the occurrence of at least one relay misoperation during the disturbance window that prevents correct fault isolation, thereby causing system-level instability.

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability of a system failure, which is defined as the occurrence of at least one relay misoperation. It is often more direct to calculate the probability of the complementary event—that is, no misoperations occur—and then subtract this from $1$.\n\nLet $F$ be the event of system failure. The probability to be computed is $P(F)$. The complementary event, $F^c$, is that no relay misoperates. Thus, $P(F) = 1 - P(F^c)$.\n\nThe event $F^c$ occurs if and only if all $N$ relays do not misoperate. Due to the i.i.d. nature of the relays' state (both their procurement compromise and subsequent operation), the overall probability $P(F^c)$ is the product of the individual probabilities that each relay does not misoperate.\nLet $q_{relay}$ be the probability that a single, randomly selected relay does not misoperate. Then, assuming independence among all relays, we have:\n$$P(F^c) = (q_{relay})^N$$\n\nTo find $q_{relay}$, we apply the law of total probability, conditioning on whether the relay is compromised or uncompromised. Let $C$ be the event that a relay is compromised, and $U$ be the event that it is uncompromised ($U = C^c$). Let $M^c$ be the event that a single relay does not misoperate.\nThe probability $q_{relay}$ is given by:\n$$q_{relay} = P(M^c) = P(M^c | C)P(C) + P(M^c | U)P(U)$$\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have:\n- The probability of a relay being compromised is $P(C) = p = 0.04$.\n- The probability of a relay being uncompromised is $P(U) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96$.\n- The probability of misoperation for a compromised relay is $s = 0.15$. Therefore, the probability it does *not* misoperate is $P(M^c | C) = 1 - s = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85$.\n- The probability of misoperation for an uncompromised relay is $u = 0.003$. Therefore, the probability it does *not* misoperate is $P(M^c | U) = 1 - u = 1 - 0.003 = 0.997$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $q_{relay}$:\n$$q_{relay} = (1-s)p + (1-u)(1-p)$$\nThis can be simplified algebraically:\n$$q_{relay} = p - sp + 1 - p - u + up = 1 - u - p(s - u)$$\n\nNow we substitute the given numerical values:\n$$q_{relay} = 1 - 0.003 - 0.04(0.15 - 0.003)$$\n$$q_{relay} = 1 - 0.003 - 0.04(0.147)$$\n$$q_{relay} = 1 - 0.003 - 0.00588$$\n$$q_{relay} = 0.99112$$\n\nThis is the probability that a single relay does not misoperate. The probability that none of the $N=50$ relays misoperate is:\n$$P(F^c) = (q_{relay})^N = (0.99112)^{50}$$\nCalculating this value:\n$$P(F^c) \\approx 0.64021735$$\n\nFinally, the probability of system failure, $P(F)$, is the complement of $P(F^c)$:\n$$P(F) = 1 - P(F^c)$$\n$$P(F) = 1 - (0.99112)^{50}$$\n$$P(F) \\approx 1 - 0.64021735 = 0.35978265$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$P(F) \\approx 0.3598$$\nThis final value represents the expected system failure probability.

            "problem": "A utility is assessing cyber-physical security risk for a high-voltage transformer within a $24$-hour evaluation window. The top event, denoted by $O$, is a cyber-induced transformer overload. The control architecture includes Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), protective relays, and embedded controllers. The transformer may be driven into overload through two logically distinct paths, each composed of basic cyber-physical failure events. All basic events are defined as probabilities of occurrence within the given window and are assumed mutually independent. The two paths are:\n\n- Path $M_{1}$ (direct manipulation with protection defeat): $M_{1}$ occurs if and only if the following four basic events occur together (an AND gate):\n  - $B_{1}$: Attacker obtains write privileges to SCADA through credential compromise, with probability $p_{1} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-3}$.\n  - $B_{2}$: Network segmentation is misconfigured such that pivoting to the field controller is feasible, with probability $p_{2} = 8.0 \\times 10^{-4}$.\n  - $B_{3}$: The controller’s command validation can be bypassed, with probability $p_{3} = 3.5 \\times 10^{-3}$.\n  - $B_{4}$: Protective relay trip logic is disabled, with probability $p_{4} = 6.0 \\times 10^{-4}$.\n\n- Path $M_{2}$ (false data injection leading to unobserved thermal stress): $M_{2}$ occurs if and only if the following three basic events occur together (an AND gate):\n  - $C_{1}$: False data injection targeting thermal measurements is successful, with probability $p_{5} = 9.0 \\times 10^{-4}$.\n  - $C_{2}$: A peak-demand ramp coincides with falsified telemetry and is accepted for dispatch, with probability $p_{6} = 4.0 \\times 10^{-3}$.\n  - $C_{3}$: Backup thermal protection is unavailable due to maintenance, with probability $p_{7} = 1.8 \\times 10^{-3}$.\n\nThe top event $O$ occurs if and only if at least one of the two path events occurs (an OR gate), i.e., $O$ occurs if and only if $M_{1}$ or $M_{2}$ occurs.

The scenario described—a cyber-physical attack on an electrical grid component—is a recognized and realistic risk in energy systems modeling. All aspects are consistent with established scientific and engineering principles.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is fully specified.

This structure guarantees that a unique, meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased technical language, free from any subjectivity.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem provides all necessary data and constraints. The description of the fault tree (two AND gates leading to an OR gate) is perfectly consistent with the provided minimal cut sets.\n- **Realism**: The assigned probabilities are small, which is characteristic of the low-frequency, high-impact events studied in risk analysis. The scenario is plausible.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-defined and self-contained exercise in applied probability. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the computation of the probability of the top event, $O$. The structure of the system is described by a fault tree where the top event $O$ is the output of an OR gate with inputs from two intermediate events, $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$. This relationship is expressed as $O = M_{1} \\cup M_{2}$.\n\nThe probability of the union of two events is given by the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n$$P(O) = P(M_{1} \\cup M_{2}) = P(M_{1}) + P(M_{2}) - P(M_{1} \\cap M_{2})$$\n\nThe intermediate event $M_{1}$ occurs if and only if all four of its constituent basic events ($B_{1}$, $B_{2}$, $B_{3}$, $B_{4}$) occur. This corresponds to an AND gate, or the intersection of these events: $M_{1} = B_{1} \\cap B_{2} \\cap B_{3} \\cap B_{4}$. Since the basic events are defined as mutually independent, the probability of $M_{1}$ is the product of the probabilities of the basic events:\n$$P(M_{1}) = P(B_{1})P(B_{2})P(B_{3})P(B_{4}) = p_{1}p_{2}p_{3}p_{4}$$\n\nSimilarly, the intermediate event $M_{2}$ occurs if and only if all three of its constituent basic events ($C_{1}$, $C_{2}$, $C_{3}$) occur. This corresponds to another AND gate: $M_{2} = C_{1} \\cap C_{2} \\cap C_{3}$. Given their independence, the probability of $M_{2}$ is:\n$$P(M_{2}) = P(C_{1})P(C_{2})P(C_{3}) = p_{5}p_{6}p_{7}$$\n\nThe final term in the inclusion-exclusion formula is $P(M_{1} \\cap M_{2})$. The event $M_{1} \\cap M_{2}$ signifies that both paths occur. This requires all basic events in both minimal cut sets to occur simultaneously. The problem states that the sets of basic events $\\{B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}, B_{4}\\}$ and $\\{C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}\\}$ are disjoint, and that *all* basic events are mutually independent. Consequently, the composite events $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ are also independent. Therefore, the probability of their intersection is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$P(M_{1} \\cap M_{2}) = P(M_{1})P(M_{2})$$\n\nSubstituting this back into the formula for $P(O)$ gives:\n$$P(O) = P(M_{1}) + P(M_{2}) - P(M_{1})P(M_{2})$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values for the probabilities.\nFirst, calculate $P(M_{1})$:\n$$P(M_{1}) = (1.2 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times (8.0 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times (3.5 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times (6.0 \\times 10^{-4})$$\n$$P(M_{1}) = (1.2 \\times 8.0 \\times 3.5 \\times 6.0) \\times 10^{(-3-4-3-4)}$$\n$$P(M_{1}) = 201.6 \\times 10^{-14} = 2.016 \\times 10^{-12}$$\n\nNext, calculate $P(M_{2})$:\n$$P(M_{2}) = (9.0 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times (4.0 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times (1.8 \\times 10^{-3})$$\n$$P(M_{2}) = (9.0 \\times 4.0 \\times 1.8) \\times 10^{(-4-3-3)}$$\n$$P(M_{2}) = 64.8 \\times 10^{-10} = 6.48 \\times 10^{-9}$$\n\nNow, substitute these probabilities into the formula for $P(O)$:\n$$P(O) = (2.016 \\times 10^{-12}) + (6.48 \\times 10^{-9}) - (2.016 \\times 10^{-12}) \\times (6.48 \\times 10^{-9})$$\nThe interaction term, $P(M_{1})P(M_{2})$, is:\n$$P(M_{1})P(M_{2}) = 13.06368 \\times 10^{-21} = 1.306368 \\times 10^{-20}$$\nThis term is many orders of magnitude smaller than $P(M_{1})$ and $P(M_{2})$ and can be considered negligible for the required precision.\n\nLet's sum the first two terms after aligning their exponents:\n$$P(M_{1}) = 2.016 \\times 10^{-12} = 0.002016 \\times 10^{-9}$$\n$$P(M_{1}) + P(M_{2}) = (0.002016 \\times 10^{-9}) + (6.48 \\times 10^{-9}) = 6.482016 \\times 10^{-9}$$\n\nNow, perform the full calculation for $P(O)$:\n$$P(O) = 6.482016 \\times 10^{-9} - 1.306368 \\times 10^{-20}$$\n$$P(O) = 6.482015999999998693632 \\times 10^{-9}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\nThe calculated probability is approximately $6.482016 \\times 10^{-9}$. The first four significant figures are $6$, $4$, $8$, and $2$. The fifth significant digit is $0$, which means we round down (i.e., truncate).\n$$P(O) \\approx 6.482 \\times 10^{-9}$$",

Then, this relationship is used to find the minimum attack magnitude required to cause a line overload, subject to physical and security constraints.\n\nFirst, we define the DC power flow model. The relationship between the vector of nodal power injections $p$ (in per-unit, pu) and the vector of bus voltage angles $\\theta$ (in radians) is given by $p = B \\theta$, where $B$ is the bus admittance matrix (specifically, its imaginary part, the susceptance matrix).

Thus, $|s| = |a|/2$.\nTo find the minimal spoofing amplitude $|s|_{\\min}$ that causes the overload, we use $|a|_{\\min}$:\n$$\n|s|_{\\min} = \\frac{|a|_{\\min}}{k_c} = \\frac{620/7}{2} = \\frac{310}{7} \\text{ megawatts}\n$$\nLet's check if this minimal attack $|s|_{\\min}$ satisfies the detection constraint:\nIs $|s|_{\\min} = \\frac{310}{7} \\leq 75$?\n$\\frac{310}{7} \\approx 44.286$. Since $44.286  75$, the constraint is satisfied.\nThe minimal spoofing amplitude required to cause a line overload while respecting all actuator and detection constraints is therefore $\\frac{310}{7}$ megawatts.",
