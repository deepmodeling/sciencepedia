The number of possible schedules is small enough to be enumerated completely.\nThe objective is to minimize $Z = 80 C_1 + 40 C_2 + 20 C_3$.\n\nThere are $\\binom{3}{1} = 3$ ways to partition the tasks:\n1.  Partition: $\\{$Task $1$\\}, $\\{$Tasks $2, 3\\}$\n2.  Partition: $\\{$Task $2$\\}, $\\{$Tasks $1, 3\\}$\n3.  Partition: $\\{$Task $3$\\}, $\\{$Tasks $1, 2\\}$\n\nFor each partition, we evaluate the two possible sequences for the crew handling two tasks.\n\n**Case 1: Crew A gets Task 1; Crew B gets Tasks 2, 3.**\n- Crew A: $C_1 = t_{0,1} + r_1 = 0.5 + 2.0 = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n- Crew B, sequence $0 \\to 2 \\to 3$:\n    - $S_2 = t_{0,2} = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{h}$. $C_2 = 0.3 + r_2 = 0.3 + 1.5 = 1.8\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n    - $S_3 = C_2 + t_{2,3} = 1.8 + 0.5 = 2.3\\,\\mathrm{h}$. $C_3 = 2.3 + r_3 = 2.3 + 1.0 = 3.3\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n    - Energy = $80(2.5) + 40(1.8) + 20(3.3) = 200 + 72 + 66 = 338\\,\\mathrm{MWh}$.\n- Crew B, sequence $0 \\to 3 \\to 2$:\n    - $S_3 = t_{0,3} = 0.6\\,\\mathrm{h}$. $C_3 = 0.6 + r_3 = 0.6 + 1.0 = 1.6\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n    - $S_2 = C_3 + t_{3,2} = 1.6 + 0.5 = 2.1\\,\\mathrm{h}$. $C_2 = 2.1 + r_2 = 2.1 + 1.5 = 3.6\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n    - Energy = $80(2.5) + 40(3.6) + 20(1.6) = 200 + 144 + 32 = 376\\,\\mathrm{MWh}$.\nThe minimum for this partition is $338\\,\\mathrm{MWh}$.\n\n**Case 2: Crew A gets Task 2; Crew B gets Tasks 1, 3.**\n- Crew A: $C_2 = t_{0,2} + r_2 = 0.3 + 1.5 = 1.8\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n- Crew B, sequence $0 \\to 1 \\to 3$:\n    - $S_1 = t_{0,1} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{h}$. $C_1 = 0.5 + r_1 = 0.5 + 2.0 = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n    - $S_3 = C_1 + t_{1,3} = 2.5 + 0.7 = 3.2\\,\\mathrm{h}$. $C_3 = 3.2 + r_3 = 3.2 + 1.0 = 4.2\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n    - Energy = $80(2.5) + 40(1.8) + 20(4.2) = 200 + 72 + 84 = 356\\,\\mathrm{MWh}$.\n- Crew B, sequence $0 \\to 3 \\to 1$:\n    - $S_3 = t_{0,3} = 0.6\\,\\mathrm{h}$. $C_3 = 0.6 + r_3 = 0.6 + 1.0 = 1.6\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n    - $S_1 = C_3 + t_{3,1} = 1.6 + 0.7 = 2.3\\,\\mathrm{h}$. $C_1 = 2.3 + r_1 = 2.3 + 2.0 = 4.3\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n    - Energy = $80(4.3) + 40(1.8) + 20(1.6) = 344 + 72 + 32 = 448\\,\\mathrm{MWh}$.\nThe minimum for this partition is $356\\,\\mathrm{MWh}$.\n\n**Case 3: Crew A gets Task 3; Crew B gets Tasks 1, 2.**\n- Crew A: $C_3 = t_{0,3} + r_3 = 0.6 + 1.0 = 1.6\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n- Crew B, sequence $0 \\to 1 \\to 2$:\n    - $S_1 = t_{0,1} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{h}$. $C_1 = 0.5 + r_1 = 0.5 + 2.0 = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n    - $S_2 = C_1 + t_{1,2} = 2.5 + 0.4 = 2.9\\,\\mathrm{h}$. $C_2 = 2.9 + r_2 = 2.9 + 1.5 = 4.4\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n    - Energy = $80(2.5) + 40(4.4) + 20(1.6) = 200 + 176 + 32 = 408\\,\\mathrm{MWh}$.\n- Crew B, sequence $0 \\to 2 \\to 1$:\n    - $S_2 = t_{0,2} = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{h}$. $C_2 = 0.3 + r_2 = 0.3 + 1.5 = 1.8\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n    - $S_1 = C_2 + t_{2,1} = 1.8 + 0.4 = 2.2\\,\\mathrm{h}$. $C_1 = 2.2 + r_1 = 2.2 + 2.0 = 4.2\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n    - Energy = $80(4.2) + 40(1.8) + 20(1.6) = 336 + 72 + 32 = 440\\,\\mathrm{MWh}$.\nThe minimum for this partition is $408\\,\\mathrm{MWh}$.\n\nComparing the minimums from each case: $\\{338, 356, 408\\}$. The global minimum total weighted outage energy is $338\\,\\mathrm{MWh}$. The optimal schedule is: Crew A performs Task $1$ ($C_1 = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{h}$), and Crew B performs Task $2$ then Task $3$ ($C_2 = 1.8\\,\\mathrm{h}$, $C_3 = 3.3\\,\\mathrm{h}$).\n\nThe final value, $338$, rounded to four significant figures is $338.0$.",
