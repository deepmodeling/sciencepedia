            "problem": "Consider a two-period Integrated Assessment Model (IAM), with periods indexed by $t \\in \\{1,2\\}$, in which a representative social planner maximizes intertemporal social welfare under Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) preferences. The period utility is $u(c)=\\frac{c^{1-\\eta}}{1-\\eta}$ for $\\eta \\neq 1$ and $u(c)=\\ln(c)$ for $\\eta=1$, where $\\eta$ is the elasticity of marginal utility of consumption. Let the social welfare be $W = u(c_{1}) + \\beta u(c_{2})$, where $\\beta \\in (0,1)$ is the gross utility discount factor. Production yields deterministic baseline consumption $Y_{1}$ in period $1$ and $Y_{2}$ in period $2$. Emissions occur in period $1$ and cause linear climate damages in period $2$ that reduce consumption in period $2$ by $\\phi$ units of consumption per unit of emissions, with $\\phi0$. Abatement occurs in period $1$ and reduces emissions at a convex resource cost that is paid out of period $1$ consumption. Assume the marginal unit of emissions under consideration is small enough that the evaluation of marginal utilities can be taken at the baseline consumption levels, so that $c_{1}=Y_{1}$ and $c_{2}=Y_{2}$ for the purpose of evaluating the optimal Pigouvian tax on period $1$ emissions.\n\nUsing first principles of welfare maximization and the marginal rate of substitution, the optimal period $1$ Pigouvian carbon tax is the period $1$ consumption-equivalent of the discounted marginal damage occurring in period $2$, i.e., it equals the discounted marginal damage weighted by the ratio of marginal utilities between periods. Let $Y_{1}=\\;100$, $Y_{2}=\\;125$, $\\beta=\\frac{1}{1+\\delta}$ with $\\delta=\\;0.02$, and $\\phi0$ given and constant across the scenarios below.\n\nCalculate the multiplicative effect on the optimal period $1$ Pigouvian carbon tax of increasing $\\eta$ from $\\eta=\\;1$ to $\\eta=\\;2$. Report your answer as the dimensionless factor $\\tau(\\eta=\\;2)/\\tau(\\eta=\\;1)$, rounded to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the multiplicative effect on the optimal period $1$ Pigouvian carbon tax, denoted by $\\tau$, when the elasticity of marginal utility of consumption, $\\eta$, is increased from $\\eta=1$ to $\\eta=2$. This effect is expressed as the ratio $\\frac{\\tau(\\eta=2)}{\\tau(\\eta=1)}$.\n\nFirst, we must establish the analytical form of the optimal Pigouvian tax, $\\tau$. The problem states that a representative social planner maximizes the intertemporal social welfare function $W$, given by:\n$$W = u(c_{1}) + \\beta u(c_{2})$$\nwhere $c_t$ is consumption in period $t$, $\\beta$ is the utility discount factor, and $u(c)$ is the period utility function.\n\nThe optimal Pigouvian tax in period $1$ must be equal to the marginal external cost of emissions, evaluated in period $1$ consumption units. This is also known as the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC). Let us consider a marginal unit of emissions, $dE$, in period $1$. This emission causes a marginal damage in period $2$ equivalent to a loss of $\\phi dE$ units of consumption. The corresponding change in period $2$ consumption is $dc_2 = -\\phi dE$. This marginal emission is a consequence of forgoing a marginal unit of abatement. The cost of this marginal abatement is the Pigouvian tax, $\\tau$. By forgoing abatement, period $1$ consumption is increased by this amount, so $dc_1 = \\tau dE$.\n\nAt the social optimum, the marginal change in welfare from this trade-off must be zero:\n$$dW = \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial c_1} dc_1 + \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial c_2} dc_2 = 0$$\nThe partial derivatives of the welfare function are $\\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial c_1} = u'(c_1)$ and $\\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial c_2} = \\beta u'(c_2)$. Substituting these and the expressions for $dc_1$ and $dc_2$ into the optimality condition, we get:\n$$u'(c_1) (\\tau dE) + \\beta u'(c_2) (-\\phi dE) = 0$$\nAssuming $dE \\neq 0$, we can divide by $dE$ and solve for $\\tau$:\n$$u'(c_1)\\tau = \\beta u'(c_2)\\phi$$\n$$\\tau = \\phi \\beta \\frac{u'(c_2)}{u'(c_1)}$$\nThis expression represents the discounted marginal damage ($\\phi$) weighted by the ratio of marginal utilities, which converts the utility loss in period $2$ into equivalent consumption units of period $1$. This confirms the description given in the problem statement.\n\nThe utility function is of the Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) form, $u(c) = \\frac{c^{1-\\eta}}{1-\\eta}$ for $\\eta \\neq 1$, and $u(c) = \\ln(c)$ for $\\eta=1$. The marginal utility, $u'(c)$, is the derivative with respect to $c$.\nFor $\\eta \\neq 1$:\n$$u'(c) = \\frac{d}{dc}\\left(\\frac{c^{1-\\eta}}{1-\\eta}\\right) = \\frac{(1-\\eta)c^{1-\\eta-1}}{1-\\eta} = c^{-\\eta}$$\nFor $\\eta = 1$:\n$$u'(c) = \\frac{d}{dc}(\\ln(c)) = \\frac{1}{c} = c^{-1}$$\nThus, the marginal utility function can be generally expressed as $u'(c) = c^{-\\eta}$ for all $\\eta0$.\n\nSubstituting this general form of the marginal utility into the expression for $\\tau$:\n$$\\tau = \\phi \\beta \\frac{c_2^{-\\eta}}{c_1^{-\\eta}} = \\phi \\beta \\left(\\frac{c_2}{c_1}\\right)^{-\\eta} = \\phi \\beta \\left(\\frac{c_1}{c_2}\\right)^{\\eta}$$\n\nThe problem states that for the purpose of this calculation, we should evaluate the marginal utilities at the baseline consumption levels, $c_1 = Y_1$ and $c_2 = Y_2$. This simplifies the tax formula to be a function of $\\eta$ and the given parameters:\n$$\\tau(\\eta) = \\phi \\beta \\left(\\frac{Y_1}{Y_2}\\right)^{\\eta}$$\n\nWe are asked to find the ratio of the tax for $\\eta=2$ to the tax for $\\eta=1$.\nLet's compute $\\tau(2)$ and $\\tau(1)$:\nFor $\\eta=2$:\n$$\\tau(2) = \\phi \\beta \\left(\\frac{Y_1}{Y_2}\\right)^{2}$$\nFor $\\eta=1$:\n$$\\tau(1) = \\phi \\beta \\left(\\frac{Y_1}{Y_2}\\right)^{1}$$\n\nNow, we calculate the required ratio:\n$$\\frac{\\tau(2)}{\\tau(1)} = \\frac{\\phi \\beta \\left(\\frac{Y_1}{Y_2}\\right)^{2}}{\\phi \\beta \\left(\\frac{Y_1}{Y_2}\\right)^{1}}$$\nThe terms $\\phi$ and $\\beta$ cancel out:\n$$\\frac{\\tau(2)}{\\tau(1)} = \\left(\\frac{Y_1}{Y_2}\\right)^{2-1} = \\frac{Y_1}{Y_2}$$\n\nThe problem provides the numerical values $Y_1 = 100$ and $Y_2 = 125$. Note that the values for $\\beta$ and $\\delta$ are not needed for this ratio.\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\\frac{\\tau(2)}{\\tau(1)} = \\frac{100}{125}$$\nSimplifying the fraction:\n$$\\frac{100}{125} = \\frac{4 \\times 25}{5 \\times 25} = \\frac{4}{5} = 0.8$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The exact value $0.8$ is written as $0.8000$ to meet this requirement.",
