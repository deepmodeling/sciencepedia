            "problem": "A centrifugal pump circulates water in the supply header of a district heating network. The pump impeller is geometrically similar across operating conditions, with fixed impeller diameter $D$. The fluid is water at approximately constant thermophysical properties, and the operating regime is fully turbulent such that viscous effects can be neglected in first approximation. Starting from first principles of turbomachinery and dimensional analysis (specifically the Euler turbomachinery equation and the Buckingham Pi theorem), derive and state the similarity (affinity) laws that relate the volumetric flow rate $Q$, the pump head $H$, and the shaft power $P$ to the rotational speed $n$ and the impeller diameter $D$ for geometrically similar pumps operating at dynamically similar points. Then, apply these laws to predict the head–flow characteristic at a new speed for the same impeller.\n\nAt an initial rotational speed $n_{1} = 1480$ revolutions per minute (denoted $\\mathrm{r/min}$), with constant impeller diameter $D = 0.30$ meters, the measured pump characteristic for water is \n$$\nH_{n_{1}}(q) = 32 - 8000\\,q^{2},\n$$\nwhere $H$ is the head in meters and $q$ is the volumetric flow rate in $\\mathrm{m^3/s}$.

Verdict:**\nThe problem is valid. It is a standard and well-formulated problem in the field of energy systems and fluid machinery.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Affinity Laws\n\nThe affinity laws describe the relationships between pump performance variables ($Q, H, P$) and operating parameters ($n, D$) for dynamically similar conditions. Dynamic similarity implies that the flow patterns are geometrically similar, and thus dimensionless groups governing the flow are constant. We will use dimensional analysis via the Buckingham Pi theorem.\n\nThe relevant physical quantities are:\n- Volumetric flow rate $Q$ [Dimensions: $L^{3}T^{-1}$]\n- Head $H$ [Dimensions: $L$]. It is more fundamental to work with the energy supplied per unit mass, $gH$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. The dimensions of $gH$ are $(LT^{-2})(L) = L^{2}T^{-2}$.\n- Shaft power $P$ [Dimensions: $ML^{2}T^{-3}$]\n- Rotational speed $n$ [Dimensions: $T^{-1}$]\n- Impeller diameter $D$ [Dimensions: $L$]\n- Fluid density $\\rho$ [Dimensions: $ML^{-3}$]\n\nThe problem states to neglect viscous effects, so the fluid viscosity $\\mu$ is not included. We have $6$ variables and $3$ fundamental dimensions (Mass $M$, Length $L$, Time $T$). According to the Buckingham Pi theorem, there will be $6 - 3 = 3$ independent dimensionless groups (Pi groups).\n\nWe select $\\rho$, $n$, and $D$ as the repeating variables as they contain all fundamental dimensions.\n\n**Pi group for Flow Rate ($\\Pi_Q$):**\nWe seek a dimensionless group involving $Q$.\n$$ \\Pi_Q = Q^{1} \\rho^{a} n^{b} D^{c} $$\nIn terms of dimensions:\n$$ [\\Pi_Q] = (L^{3}T^{-1})^{1} (ML^{-3})^{a} (T^{-1})^{b} (L)^{c} = M^{0}L^{0}T^{0} $$\nEquating exponents for each dimension:\n- $M: a = 0$\n- $T: -1 - b = 0 \\implies b = -1$\n- $L: 3 - 3a + c = 0 \\implies 3 - 0 + c = 0 \\implies c = -3$\nThus, the flow coefficient is $\\Pi_Q = \\frac{Q}{n D^{3}}$.\n\n**Pi group for Head ($\\Pi_H$):**\nWe seek a dimensionless group involving $gH$.\n$$ \\Pi_H = (gH)^{1} \\rho^{a} n^{b} D^{c} $$\nIn terms of dimensions:\n$$ [\\Pi_H] = (L^{2}T^{-2})^{1} (ML^{-3})^{a} (T^{-1})^{b} (L)^{c} = M^{0}L^{0}T^{0} $$\nEquating exponents:\n- $M: a = 0$\n- $T: -2 - b = 0 \\implies b = -2$\n- $L: 2 - 3a + c = 0 \\implies 2 - 0 + c = 0 \\implies c = -2$\nThus, the head coefficient is $\\Pi_H = \\frac{gH}{n^{2}D^{2}}$. Since $g$ is constant, we can define a practical head coefficient as $\\frac{H}{n^{2}D^{2}}$.\n\n**Pi group for Power ($\\Pi_P$):**\nWe seek a dimensionless group involving $P$.\n$$ \\Pi_P = P^{1} \\rho^{a} n^{b} D^{c} $$\nIn terms of dimensions:\n$$ [\\Pi_P] = (ML^{2}T^{-3})^{1} (ML^{-3})^{a} (T^{-1})^{b} (L)^{c} = M^{0}L^{0}T^{0} $$\nEquating exponents:\n- $M: 1 + a = 0 \\implies a = -1$\n- $T: -3 - b = 0 \\implies b = -3$\n- $L: 2 - 3a + c = 0 \\implies 2 - 3(-1) + c = 0 \\implies 5 + c = 0 \\implies c = -5$\nThus, the power coefficient is $\\Pi_P = \\frac{P}{\\rho n^{3}D^{5}}$.\n\nFor two dynamically similar operating points, (1) and (2), these dimensionless groups must be equal.\n$$ \\frac{Q_1}{n_1 D_1^3} = \\frac{Q_2}{n_2 D_2^3} $$\n$$ \\frac{H_1}{n_1^2 D_1^2} = \\frac{H_2}{n_2^2 D_2^2} $$\n$$ \\frac{P_1}{\\rho_1 n_1^3 D_1^5} = \\frac{P_2}{\\rho_2 n_2^3 D_2^5} $$\nThese equalities yield the general affinity laws:\n1.  **Flow Rate:** $\\frac{Q_2}{Q_1} = \\left(\\frac{n_2}{n_1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{D_2}{D_1}\\right)^3$\n2.  **Head:** $\\frac{H_2}{H_1} = \\left(\\frac{n_2}{n_1}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{D_2}{D_1}\\right)^2$\n3.  **Power:** $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{\\rho_2}{\\rho_1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{n_2}{n_1}\\right)^3 \\left(\\frac{D_2}{D_1}\\right)^5$\n\nThese results can be confirmed from the Euler turbomachinery equation, which states that the ideal head is proportional to the square of the impeller tip speed ($U \\propto nD$). Thus, $H \\propto (nD)^2$. The flow rate is the product of a velocity component ($v \\propto nD$) and a flow area ($A \\propto D^2$), so $Q \\propto nD^3$. Power is proportional to $\\rho Q H$, so $P \\propto \\rho (nD^3)(nD)^2 = \\rho n^3 D^5$.\n\nIn this problem, the impeller diameter $D$ is fixed ($D_1=D_2$), and the fluid is water at constant properties ($\\rho_1 = \\rho_2$). The affinity laws simplify to:\n1.  $\\frac{Q_2}{Q_1} = \\frac{n_2}{n_1}$\n2.  $\\frac{H_2}{H_1} = \\left(\\frac{n_2}{n_1}\\right)^2$\n3.  $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{n_2}{n_1}\\right)^3$\n\n### Step 3: Application to the Pump Characteristic\n\nWe are given the initial pump characteristic at speed $n_1$:\n$$ H_1 = H_{n_1}(q_1) = 32 - 8000 q_1^{2} $$\nHere, $(q_1, H_1)$ represents any point on the characteristic curve at speed $n_1$.\n\nWe want to find the new characteristic $H_2 = H_{n_2}(q_2)$ at speed $n_2$. For any point $(q_1, H_1)$ on the first curve, there is a corresponding dynamically similar point $(q_2, H_2)$ on the second curve, related by the affinity laws.\n\nFrom the affinity laws with constant diameter:\n$$ q_2 = q_1 \\left(\\frac{n_2}{n_1}\\right) \\implies q_1 = q_2 \\left(\\frac{n_1}{n_2}\\right) $$\n$$ H_2 = H_1 \\left(\\frac{n_2}{n_1}\\right)^2 $$\n\nWe can express $H_2$ as a function of $q_2$ by substitution. First, substitute the initial characteristic into the equation for $H_2$:\n$$ H_2 = \\left( 32 - 8000 q_1^{2} \\right) \\left(\\frac{n_2}{n_1}\\right)^2 $$\nNext, substitute the expression for $q_1$ in terms of $q_2$:\n$$ H_2 = \\left( 32 - 8000 \\left[q_2 \\left(\\frac{n_1}{n_2}\\right)\\right]^{2} \\right) \\left(\\frac{n_2}{n_1}\\right)^2 $$\nDistributing the factor $\\left(\\frac{n_2}{n_1}\\right)^2$ into the parentheses:\n$$ H_2 = 32 \\left(\\frac{n_2}{n_1}\\right)^2 - 8000 q_2^{2} \\left(\\frac{n_1}{n_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{n_2}{n_1}\\right)^2 $$\nThe speed ratios in the second term cancel out:\n$$ H_2 = 32 \\left(\\frac{n_2}{n_1}\\right)^2 - 8000 q_2^{2} $$\nThis expression gives the new head $H_2$ as a function of the new flow rate $q_2$. We can write this as the new characteristic function $H_{n_2}(q)$:\n$$ H_{n_2}(q) = 32 \\left(\\frac{n_2}{n_1}\\right)^2 - 8000 q^{2} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values for the speeds:\n$n_1 = 1480 \\, \\mathrm{r/min}$\n$n_2 = 1760 \\, \\mathrm{r/min}$\n\nThe ratio of the speeds is:\n$$ \\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \\frac{1760}{1480} = \\frac{176}{148} = \\frac{44 \\times 4}{37 \\times 4} = \\frac{44}{37} $$\nThe square of this ratio is:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{n_2}{n_1}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{44}{37}\\right)^2 = \\frac{44^2}{37^2} = \\frac{1936}{1369} $$\nNow we calculate the new shut-off head (the constant term):\n$$ 32 \\times \\frac{1936}{1369} = \\frac{61952}{1369} $$\nSubstituting this value back into the function for $H_{n_2}(q)$:\n$$ H_{n_2}(q) = \\frac{61952}{1369} - 8000 q^{2} $$\nThis is the explicit analytic expression for the head-flow characteristic at the new rotational speed $n_2 = 1760 \\, \\mathrm{r/min}$, with head $H$ in meters and flow rate $q$ in $\\mathrm{m^3/s}$.",

All provided data and the underlying physical scenario are consistent with established principles of fluid mechanics and thermodynamics in the context of engineering pump systems. The given values for water density and vapor pressure at $80^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ are factually correct. The problem is self-contained, providing all necessary information for a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution is provided below.\n\nThe Net Positive Suction Head (NPSH) is a measure of the total fluid head at the suction inlet of a pump over and above the head corresponding to the fluid's vapor pressure at the operating temperature. It quantifies the margin by which the absolute pressure at the pump suction exceeds the liquid's saturation vapor pressure, thereby representing the fluid's resistance to cavitation. Cavitation is the formation and subsequent implosive collapse of vapor bubbles in a liquid, which occurs when the local static pressure drops to the liquid's vapor pressure. This phenomenon can cause severe damage to pump components and reduce hydraulic performance.\n\nTo derive the expression for Net Positive Suction Head available (NPSHa), we begin by defining the total head, $H$, at the pump suction nozzle. The total head is a concept derived from the Bernoulli principle and represents the total energy per unit weight of the fluid. For a steady, incompressible flow, it is the sum of the static pressure head, the dynamic (or velocity) head, and the elevation head. Taking the suction nozzle's centerline as the reference elevation ($z_s = 0$), the total head, $H_s$, at the suction is:\n$$ H_s = \\frac{p_s}{\\rho g} + \\frac{v_s^2}{2g} $$\nwhere $p_s$ is the absolute static pressure at the suction, $v_s$ is the average fluid velocity at the suction, $\\rho$ is the fluid density, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nThe head corresponding to the liquid's saturation vapor pressure, $p_{\\mathrm{vap}}$, is the vapor pressure head, $H_{\\mathrm{vap}}$:\n$$ H_{\\mathrm{vap}} = \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{vap}}}{\\rho g} $$\nThe phase-change threshold condition states that vaporization (boiling) begins when the local absolute pressure drops to $p_{\\mathrm{vap}}$.\n\nThe Net Positive Suction Head available (NPSHa) is defined as the difference between the absolute total head at the pump suction and the vapor pressure head of the fluid. It is a characteristic of the system upstream of the pump.\n$$ \\mathrm{NPSHa} = H_s - H_{\\mathrm{vap}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $H_s$ and $H_{\\mathrm{vap}}$ yields the desired expression for NPSHa:\n$$ \\mathrm{NPSHa} = \\left(\\frac{p_s}{\\rho g} + \\frac{v_s^2}{2g}\\right) - \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{vap}}}{\\rho g} = \\frac{p_s - p_{\\mathrm{vap}}}{\\rho g} + \\frac{v_s^2}{2g} $$\nThis expression provides the NPSHa in terms of the measurable suction static pressure ($p_s$), local flow velocity ($v_s$), fluid density ($\\rho$), gravitational acceleration ($g$), and vapor pressure ($p_{\\mathrm{vap}}$).\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of NPSHa using the data provided. First, the flow velocity $v_s$ in the suction pipe is calculated from the volumetric flow rate $Q$ and the pipe's internal diameter $D$:\nThe cross-sectional area of the pipe is $A = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}$.\n$$ A = \\frac{\\pi (0.300 \\, \\mathrm{m})^2}{4} = \\frac{0.0900 \\pi}{4} \\, \\mathrm{m^2} \\approx 0.070686 \\, \\mathrm{m^2} $$\nThe velocity is then:\n$$ v_s = \\frac{Q}{A} = \\frac{0.100 \\, \\mathrm{m^3 \\, s^{-1}}}{0.070686 \\, \\mathrm{m^2}} \\approx 1.4147 \\, \\mathrm{m \\, s^{-1}} $$\n\nNow, we can calculate the two terms contributing to NPSHa.\nThe given values are:\n$p_s = 180 \\, \\mathrm{kPa} = 1.80 \\times 10^5 \\, \\mathrm{Pa}$\n$p_{\\mathrm{vap}} = 47.4 \\, \\mathrm{kPa} = 4.74 \\times 10^4 \\, \\mathrm{Pa}$\n$\\rho = 971.8 \\, \\mathrm{kg \\, m^{-3}}$\n$g = 9.81 \\, \\mathrm{m \\, s^{-2}}$\n\nThe pressure head component is:\n$$ \\frac{p_s - p_{\\mathrm{vap}}}{\\rho g} = \\frac{1.80 \\times 10^5 \\, \\mathrm{Pa} - 4.74 \\times 10^4 \\, \\mathrm{Pa}}{971.8 \\, \\mathrm{kg \\, m^{-3}} \\times 9.81 \\, \\mathrm{m \\, s^{-2}}} = \\frac{132600 \\, \\mathrm{Pa}}{9533.358 \\, \\mathrm{Pa \\, m^{-1}}} \\approx 13.9087 \\, \\mathrm{m} $$\nThe velocity head component is:\n$$ \\frac{v_s^2}{2g} = \\frac{(1.4147 \\, \\mathrm{m \\, s^{-1}})^2}{2 \\times 9.81 \\, \\mathrm{m \\, s^{-2}}} = \\frac{2.0014 \\, \\mathrm{m^2 \\, s^{-2}}}{19.62 \\, \\mathrm{m \\, s^{-2}}} \\approx 0.1020 \\, \\mathrm{m} $$\nSumming these components gives the NPSHa:\n$$ \\mathrm{NPSHa} = 13.9087 \\, \\mathrm{m} + 0.1020 \\, \\mathrm{m} \\approx 14.0107 \\, \\mathrm{m} $$\n\nThe Net Positive Suction Head required (NPSHr) is a property of the pump, specified by the manufacturer, which is given as $\\mathrm{NPSHr} = 6.00 \\, \\mathrm{m}$.

In this case, the margin is $\\mathrm{NPSH}_{\\mathrm{margin}} \\approx 8.011 \\, \\mathrm{m}$, which is a substantial positive value. This indicates that the absolute pressure of the water entering the pump is significantly higher than the pressure at which it would begin to vaporize within the pump.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the relative error incurred by approximating the temperature-dependent specific heat capacity of water with a constant value in the context of a district heating network pipe segment.\n\nFirst, we establish the thermodynamic framework. The first law of thermodynamics for a steady-flow open system, also known as the Steady-Flow Energy Equation (SFEE), states that the net energy transfer into a control volume is zero. Per unit mass flowing through the system, this is expressed as:\n$$\nq - w = \\Delta h + \\Delta e_k + \\Delta e_p\n$$\nwhere $q$ is the heat transferred into the system per unit mass, $w$ is the work done by the system per unit mass, $\\Delta h$ is the change in specific enthalpy, $\\Delta e_k$ is the change in specific kinetic energy, and $\\Delta e_p$ is the change in specific potential energy between the outlet and inlet.\n\nThe problem specifies the following assumptions for the pipe segment:\n- Steady state operation.\n- Negligible changes in kinetic energy ($\\Delta e_k \\approx 0$).\n- Negligible changes in potential energy ($\\Delta e_p \\approx 0$).\n- No work is done ($w=0$), as a pipe is a passive component.\n\nUnder these assumptions, the SFEE simplifies to $q = \\Delta h$.

Thus, $h_{\\text{in}} = h(T_{\\mathrm{s}})$ and $h_{\\text{out}} = h(T_{\\mathrm{r}})$. The specific heat delivered is:\n$$\nq_{\\text{delivered}} = h(T_{\\mathrm{s}}) - h(T_{\\mathrm{r}})\n$$\nFor an incompressible liquid, the differential change in specific enthalpy $dh$ is given by $dh = c_p(T) dT$, where $c_p(T)$ is the specific heat capacity at constant pressure and $T$ is the absolute temperature.

The integration limits become:\n- When $T = 323.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $U = 0\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n- When $T = 363.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $U = 40\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nThe integral becomes:\n$$\nq_{\\text{exact}} = \\int_{0}^{40} (4182 + 0.85 U) dU\n$$\n$$\nq_{\\text{exact}} = \\left[ 4182 U + 0.85 \\frac{U^2}{2} \\right]_{0}^{40}\n$$\n$$\nq_{\\text{exact}} = \\left( 4182 \\times 40 + \\frac{0.85}{2} \\times 40^2 \\right) - 0\n$$\n$$\nq_{\\text{exact}} = 167280 + 0.425 \\times 1600 = 167280 + 680 = 167960 \\, \\mathrm{J \\, kg^{-1}}\n$$\nNext, we compute the approximate specific heat delivered, $q_{\\text{const}}$, by assuming a constant specific heat capacity $c_p$ evaluated at the reference temperature $T_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 333.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\nFirst, we find the value of this constant specific heat, $c_{p, \\text{const}}$:\n$$\nc_{p, \\text{const}} = c_p(333.15) = 4182 + 0.85(333.15 - 323.15)\n$$\n$$\nc_{p, \\text{const}} = 4182 + 0.85(10) = 4182 + 8.5 = 4190.5 \\, \\mathrm{J \\, kg^{-1} \\, K^{-1}}\n$$\nWith a constant specific heat, the heat delivered is simply $q = c_p \\Delta T$:\n$$\nq_{\\text{const}} = c_{p, \\text{const}} \\times (T_{\\mathrm{s}} - T_{\\mathrm{r}})\n$$\n$$\nq_{\\text{const}} = 4190.5 \\times (363.15 - 323.15) = 4190.5 \\times 40 = 167620 \\, \\mathrm{J \\, kg^{-1}}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the signed relative error, $\\varepsilon$, using the provided definition:\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{q_{\\text{const}} - q_{\\text{exact}}}{q_{\\text{exact}}}\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{167620 - 167960}{167960} = \\frac{-340}{167960}\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\n\\varepsilon \\approx -0.00202429149...\n$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\varepsilon \\approx -0.002024\n$$\nThis negative error indicates that using a constant specific heat evaluated at $T_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 333.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$ results in an underestimation of the total heat delivered compared to the exact calculation that accounts for the temperature dependency.",
