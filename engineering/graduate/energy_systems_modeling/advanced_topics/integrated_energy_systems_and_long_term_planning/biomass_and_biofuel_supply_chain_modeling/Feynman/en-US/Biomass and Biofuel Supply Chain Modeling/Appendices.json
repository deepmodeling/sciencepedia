The givens are a reasonable empirical formula for lignocellulosic biomass ($\\mathrm{CH_{1.6}O_{0.8}}$), standard process conditions for air-blown gasification ($P=1\\,\\mathrm{bar}$, $\\phi=0.30$), a typical set of simplifying assumptions (no methane/tar, complete carbon conversion), and a key equilibrium constraint (Water-Gas Shift). The tasks involve standard chemical reaction engineering calculations based on mass conservation and chemical equilibrium, followed by a stoichiometric analysis of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. All aspects are rooted in fundamental principles of thermodynamics and stoichiometry. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first analyzing the gasification process to determine the product gas composition, and then analyzing the stoichiometry of the subsequent Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis.\n\n**Part 1: Gasification Analysis**\n\nThe analysis is performed on the basis of $1$ mole of carbon in the biomass feed, which corresponds to $1$ mole of the empirical unit $\\mathrm{CH_{1.6}O_{0.8}}$.\n\nFirst, we determine the stoichiometric oxygen requirement, $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{st}}$, for the complete combustion of the biomass to $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ and $\\mathrm{H_2O}$.\nThe balanced reaction for complete combustion is:\n$$ \\mathrm{CH_{1.6}O_{0.8}} + \\alpha_{\\mathrm{st}} \\mathrm{O_2} \\rightarrow 1 \\mathrm{CO_2} + \\frac{1.6}{2} \\mathrm{H_2O} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{CH_{1.6}O_{0.8}} + \\alpha_{\\mathrm{st}} \\mathrm{O_2} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{CO_2} + 0.8 \\mathrm{H_2O} $$\nAn elemental balance on oxygen (O) yields:\n$$ 0.8 + 2\\alpha_{\\mathrm{st}} = 2(1) + 1(0.8) $$\n$$ 2\\alpha_{\\mathrm{st}} = 2 \\implies \\alpha_{\\mathrm{st}} = 1 $$\nThe stoichiometric oxygen requirement is $1$ mole of $\\mathrm{O_2}$ per mole of biomass unit $\\mathrm{CH_{1.6}O_{0.8}}$.\n\nThe actual oxygen supplied, $\\alpha$, is given by the equivalence ratio $\\phi=0.30$:\n$$ \\alpha = \\phi \\cdot \\alpha_{\\mathrm{st}} = 0.30 \\times 1 = 0.30 \\, \\text{moles of } \\mathrm{O_2} $$\nAir is supplied with a molar ratio of $\\mathrm{N_2}:\\mathrm{O_2}$ of $3.76:1$. The moles of nitrogen, $n_{\\mathrm{N_2,in}}$, entering the gasifier are:\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{N_2,in}} = 3.76 \\cdot \\alpha = 3.76 \\times 0.30 = 1.128 \\, \\text{moles of } \\mathrm{N_2} $$\nThe overall gasification reaction, assuming the product gas contains only $\\mathrm{CO}$, $\\mathrm{CO_2}$, $\\mathrm{H_2}$, $\\mathrm{H_2O}$, and $\\mathrm{N_2}$, can be written as:\n$$ \\mathrm{CH_{1.6}O_{0.8}} + 0.30(\\mathrm{O_2} + 3.76 \\mathrm{N_2}) \\rightarrow n_{\\mathrm{CO}}\\mathrm{CO} + n_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}\\mathrm{CO_2} + n_{\\mathrm{H_2}}\\mathrm{H_2} + n_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}\\mathrm{H_2O} + n_{\\mathrm{N_2}}\\mathrm{N_2} $$\nwhere $n_i$ represents the molar amount of species $i$ in the product gas per mole of carbon fed.\n\nWe establish a system of equations based on elemental balances and the Water-Gas Shift (WGS) equilibrium.\n1. Carbon (C) balance:\n$$ 1 = n_{\\mathrm{CO}} + n_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} \\quad (1) $$\n2. Hydrogen (H) balance:\n$$ 1.6 = 2n_{\\mathrm{H_2}} + 2n_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} \\implies 0.8 = n_{\\mathrm{H_2}} + n_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} \\quad (2) $$\n3. Oxygen (O) balance:\n$$ 0.8 + 2(0.30) = n_{\\mathrm{CO}} + 2n_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} + n_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} \\implies 1.4 = n_{\\mathrm{CO}} + 2n_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} + n_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} \\quad (3) $$\n4. Nitrogen (N) balance:\n$$ 2(1.128) = 2n_{\\mathrm{N_2}} \\implies n_{\\mathrm{N_2}} = 1.128 \\quad (4) $$\n5. Water-Gas Shift (WGS) equilibrium: $\\mathrm{CO} + \\mathrm{H_2O} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{CO_2} + \\mathrm{H_2}$. The equilibrium constant is given as $K_p=1.00$. For an ideal gas mixture, $K_p$ can be expressed in terms of mole fractions $y_i$ or molar amounts $n_i$:\n$$ K_p = \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} p_{\\mathrm{H_2}}}{p_{\\mathrm{CO}} p_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}} = \\frac{y_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} y_{\\mathrm{H_2}}}{y_{\\mathrm{CO}} y_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}} = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} n_{\\mathrm{H_2}}}{n_{\\mathrm{CO}} n_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}} = 1.00 \\quad (5) $$\nThis simplifies to $n_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} n_{\\mathrm{H_2}} = n_{\\mathrm{CO}} n_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}$.\n\nWe now solve this system of equations. From (1) and (2), we express $n_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}$ and $n_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}$ in terms of $n_{\\mathrm{CO}}$ and $n_{\\mathrm{H_2}}$:\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} = 1 - n_{\\mathrm{CO}} $$\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} = 0.8 - n_{\\mathrm{H_2}} $$\nSubstitute these into the O balance (3):\n$$ 1.4 = n_{\\mathrm{CO}} + 2(1 - n_{\\mathrm{CO}}) + (0.8 - n_{\\mathrm{H_2}}) $$\n$$ 1.4 = n_{\\mathrm{CO}} + 2 - 2n_{\\mathrm{CO}} + 0.8 - n_{\\mathrm{H_2}} $$\n$$ 1.4 = 2.8 - n_{\\mathrm{CO}} - n_{\\mathrm{H_2}} $$\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{CO}} + n_{\\mathrm{H_2}} = 1.4 \\quad (A) $$\nNext, substitute into the WGS equilibrium relation (5):\n$$ (1 - n_{\\mathrm{CO}}) n_{\\mathrm{H_2}} = n_{\\mathrm{CO}} (0.8 - n_{\\mathrm{H_2}}) $$\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{H_2}} - n_{\\mathrm{CO}}n_{\\mathrm{H_2}} = 0.8 n_{\\mathrm{CO}} - n_{\\mathrm{CO}}n_{\\mathrm{H_2}} $$\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{H_2}} = 0.8 n_{\\mathrm{CO}} \\quad (B) $$\nNow we solve the linear system of equations (A) and (B). Substitute (B) into (A):\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{CO}} + 0.8 n_{\\mathrm{CO}} = 1.4 \\implies 1.8 n_{\\mathrm{CO}} = 1.4 $$\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{CO}} = \\frac{1.4}{1.8} = \\frac{14}{18} = \\frac{7}{9} $$\nUsing this result, we find the other molar amounts:\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{H_2}} = 0.8 \\times n_{\\mathrm{CO}} = \\frac{4}{5} \\times \\frac{7}{9} = \\frac{28}{45} $$\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} = 1 - n_{\\mathrm{CO}} = 1 - \\frac{7}{9} = \\frac{2}{9} $$\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} = 0.8 - n_{\\mathrm{H_2}} = \\frac{4}{5} - \\frac{28}{45} = \\frac{36}{45} - \\frac{28}{45} = \\frac{8}{45} $$\nAnd from (4), $n_{\\mathrm{N_2}} = 1.128$.\n\nWith these values, we can address the specific quantities requested.\n\n- **Carbon conversion to syngas, $X_{\\mathrm{C,syngas}}$**:\n$$ X_{\\mathrm{C,syngas}} = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{CO}}}{n_{\\mathrm{CO}}+n_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}} = \\frac{7/9}{7/9 + 2/9} = \\frac{7/9}{1} = \\frac{7}{9} \\approx 0.7778 $$\n\n- **Molar composition of the gas phase, $y_i$**:\nThe total moles of gas, $n_{\\mathrm{total}}$, are:\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{total}} = n_{\\mathrm{CO}} + n_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} + n_{\\mathrm{H_2}} + n_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} + n_{\\mathrm{N_2}} $$\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\left(\\frac{7}{9} + \\frac{2}{9}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{28}{45} + \\frac{8}{45}\\right) + 1.128 = 1 + \\frac{36}{45} + 1.128 = 1 + 0.8 + 1.128 = 2.928 $$\nThe molar compositions $y_i = n_i/n_{\\mathrm{total}}$ are:\n$y_{\\mathrm{CO}} = \\frac{7/9}{2.928} \\approx 0.2656$\n$y_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} = \\frac{2/9}{2.928} \\approx 0.0759$\n$y_{\\mathrm{H_2}} = \\frac{28/45}{2.928} \\approx 0.2125$\n$y_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} = \\frac{8/45}{2.928} \\approx 0.0607$\n$y_{\\mathrm{N_2}} = \\frac{1.128}{2.928} \\approx 0.3852$\n\n- **Produced $\\mathrm{H_2/CO}$ ratio, $R_{\\mathrm{prod}}$**:\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{prod}} = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{H_2}}}{n_{\\mathrm{CO}}} = \\frac{28/45}{7/9} = \\frac{28}{45} \\times \\frac{9}{7} = \\frac{4}{5} = 0.8 $$\n\n**Part 2: Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis Stoichiometry**\n\nThe final task is to derive the required $\\mathrm{H_2/CO}$ feed ratio for FT synthesis of an $n$-paraffin, $\\mathrm{C_nH_{2n+2}}$.

Two farms, denoted by $F_1$ and $F_2$, can ship feedstock to two biorefineries, denoted by $R_1$ and $R_2$. The objective is to minimize total annualized system cost to meet a fixed ethanol demand at a terminal equal to $D = 120\\,\\text{million liters}$. The biorefinery $R_1$ has a capacity $K_1 = 100\\,\\text{million liters}$, while $R_2$ is effectively unconstrained for the demand scale considered.

Assume that each refinery will source from the farm that yields the lowest unit ethanol cost when fully loaded, i.e., no blending or convex combinations change average unit costs at the margin.\n\nDefine decision variables $q_1$ and $q_2$ as ethanol production rates (liters) at $R_1$ and $R_2$, respectively. The demand must be met, so $q_1 + q_2 \\ge D$, and $R_1$ capacity imposes $q_1 \\le K_1$.

The capacity of $R_1$ limits its production to $q_1 = K_1 = 100,000,000\\,\\text{L}$.\n\nTo meet the total demand of $D = 120,000,000\\,\\text{L}$, the remaining amount must be produced by $R_2$:\n$$ q_2 = D - q_1 = 120,000,000 - 100,000,000 = 20,000,000\\,\\text{L} $$\nThe optimal production plan is $q_1^* = 100,000,000\\,\\text{L}$ and $q_2^* = 20,000,000\\,\\text{L}$. At this solution, both the demand constraint ($100+20=120$) and the capacity constraint on $R_1$ are active (binding).\n\n**3. Compute the Shadow Price of the Capacity Constraint**\n\nThe shadow price of a constraint is the marginal change in the optimal objective function value for a unit relaxation of that constraint's right-hand-side (RHS). The constraint is $q_1 \\le K_1$. We are interested in the effect of increasing $K_1$.\n\nLet's consider an infinitesimal increase in capacity, $dK_1$. Because $C_1 < C_2$, it remains optimal to use this new capacity at $R_1$. The new production at $R_1$ will be $q_1 = K_1 + dK_1$. To maintain the demand balance $q_1 + q_2 = D$, the production at $R_2$ must decrease by the same amount: $q_2 = (D - K_1) - dK_1$.\nThe change in production is $dq_1 = dK_1$ and $dq_2 = -dK_1$.\n\nThe change in total cost, $dZ$, is:\n$$ dZ = C_1 dq_1 + C_2 dq_2 = C_1(dK_1) + C_2(-dK_1) = (C_1 - C_2)dK_1 $$\nThe shadow price is defined as the marginal *improvement* (decrease) in cost per unit increase in $K_1$. Mathematically, this is $-\\frac{dZ}{dK_1}$.\n$$ \\text{Shadow Price} = -\\frac{dZ}{dK_1} = -(C_1 - C_2) = C_2 - C_1 $$\nThis result is intuitive: for every extra liter of capacity at the cheaper refinery $R_1$, we can shift one liter of production from the more expensive refinery $R_2$, saving the difference in their unit costs.\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$$ \\text{Shadow Price} = C_2 - C_1 = \\frac{23}{75}\\,\\$/\\text{L} - 0.248125\\,\\$/\\text{L} \\approx 0.306667\\,\\$/\\text{L} - 0.248125\\,\\$/\\text{L} = 0.05854166... \\,\\$/\\text{L} $$\nRounding to five decimal places, the shadow price is $0.05854\\,\\$/\\text{L}$.\n\n**4. Economic Interpretation**\n\nThe shadow price of $0.05854\\,\\$/\\text{L}$ represents the marginal economic benefit, or cost saving, for each additional liter of annual production capacity at refinery $R_1$. The marginal cost to add this capacity is given as $\\gamma = 0.050\\,\\$/\\text{L}$.\n\nTo determine if expansion is justified, we compare the marginal benefit (shadow price) to the marginal cost ($\\gamma$):\n$$ \\text{Marginal Benefit} = 0.05854\\,\\$/\\text{L} $$\n$$ \\text{Marginal Cost} = 0.050\\,\\$/\\text{L} $$\nSince Marginal Benefit > Marginal Cost ($0.05854 > 0.050$), the savings from using the new capacity are greater than the cost of creating it. Therefore, at the margin, a small expansion of $R_1$'s capacity is economically justified.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. The shadow price of $R_1$ capacity is $0.05854\\,\\$/\\text{L}$; because $0.05854 > \\gamma = 0.050$, an infinitesimal expansion of $K_1$ is economically justified at the margin.**\nThis option states the shadow price is $0.05854\\,\\$/\\text{L}$, which matches our calculated value of $C_2 - C_1$. It correctly compares this value to the marginal expansion cost $\\gamma = 0.050\\,\\$/\\text{L}$ and draws the correct economic conclusion that expansion is justified because the benefit exceeds the cost.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The shadow price of $R_1$ capacity is $-0.05854\\,\\$/\\text{L}$; because it is negative, expanding $K_1$ would increase total cost, so an infinitesimal expansion is not justified.**\nThe sign is incorrect for the economic definition of a shadow price (a marginal value or benefit). While the formal Lagrange multiplier for this constraint is indeed negative (equal to $C_1 - C_2$), its interpretation here is flawed. A negative multiplier implies that increasing the RHS *decreases* the objective function (cost), meaning expansion is beneficial. This option incorrectly concludes the opposite.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The shadow price equals the full unit cost at $R_2$, $0.30667\\,\\$/\\text{L}$; since this exceeds $\\gamma = 0.050$, expansion should not be undertaken.**\nThe shadow price is the *difference* in marginal costs ($C_2 - C_1$), not the full marginal cost of the displaced production ($C_2$). The premise is factually wrong. Furthermore, the reasoning is contradictory: if the benefit ($0.30667$) were to exceed the cost ($0.050$), expansion *should* be undertaken, not the other way around.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Dual variables for capacity constraints are not meaningful in Mixed-Integer Linear Programming, so the shadow price cannot be computed or interpreted for $K_1$.**\nThis statement is an overgeneralization and is false in the context of this problem. The problem explicitly directs the analysis to the \"continuous linear programming substructure\" and \"the usual sense of linear programming duality\". For the resulting LP model, the shadow price is well-defined, computable, and highly meaningful for economic interpretation. The mention of MILP in the problem description provides context but does not invalidate the application of LP duality as requested.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

            "introduction": "A central goal of deploying biofuels is to achieve environmental benefits, a dimension assessed through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). This practice confronts a common and critical challenge in LCA: how to allocate environmental burdens when a single process yields multiple valuable products, such as fuel and electricity . By calculating the greenhouse gas intensity of ethanol using both the energy allocation and system expansion methods, you will gain hands-on experience with standard LCA procedures and appreciate how methodological choices can significantly shape the conclusions of an environmental assessment.",

            "problem": "A cellulosic biorefinery processes one metric tonne of dry lignocellulosic biomass and produces two energy products: fuel ethanol and surplus electricity exported to the grid. You are asked to quantify the greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity of ethanol under two co-product handling approaches—energy allocation and system expansion—and then compute the difference between the two intensities.\n\nUse the following scientifically defensible and internally consistent data and assumptions:\n- Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) system boundary is cradle-to-gate for the ethanol product, counting all non-biogenic emissions up to the plant gate. Carbon dioxide of biogenic origin is not counted; methane and nitrous oxide are included in the given totals.\n- Total upstream supply-chain GHG emissions (harvesting, preprocessing, and transport) for the one-tonne batch are $120$ kilograms carbon dioxide equivalent (kg $\\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e}$).\n- Total biorefinery non-biogenic process emissions for the one-tonne batch are $300$ kg $\\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e}$.\n- Ethanol yield is $300$ liters per tonne, with Lower Heating Value (LHV) of ethanol equal to $21.1$ megajoules per liter (MJ/L).\n- Net electricity exported is $0.60$ megawatt-hours (MWh) per tonne. Use $3600$ MJ per MWh to convert electrical energy to megajoules.\n- The grid-average GHG emission factor for displaced electricity is $450$ kg $\\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e}$ per MWh.\n- Energy Allocation: burdens are attributed to co-products in proportion to their energy content.\n- System Expansion: the exported electricity is modeled as displacing average grid electricity on an energy-equivalent basis; assign an avoided burden credit equal to the emission factor times the exported electricity. The remaining net burdens are fully assigned to ethanol.\n\nStarting only from conservation of mass and energy and the definitions of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) attribution and substitution, derive expressions for the ethanol GHG intensity under each approach and compute their numerical values. Then, compute the difference defined as “energy-allocation intensity minus system-expansion intensity.” Express the final difference in grams $\\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e}$ per megajoule of ethanol energy (g $\\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e}$/MJ) and round your final answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity of ethanol under two different co-product allocation methods in a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) framework: energy allocation and system expansion. The final objective is to compute the difference between these two intensities. The system boundary is cradle-to-gate for the processing of one metric tonne ($1$ t) of dry lignocellulosic biomass.\n\nFirst, we define and quantify the total system emissions and the energy content of the co-products based on the provided data.\n\nThe total upstream and process emissions, denoted as $E_{total}$, are the sum of the supply-chain emissions ($E_{up}$) and the biorefinery process emissions ($E_{proc}$).\nLet $E_{up} = 120 \\text{ kg } \\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e}$ and $E_{proc} = 300 \\text{ kg } \\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e}$.\n$$\nE_{total} = E_{up} + E_{proc} = 120 \\text{ kg } \\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e} + 300 \\text{ kg } \\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e} = 420 \\text{ kg } \\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e}\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the energy content of the two co-products: fuel ethanol and surplus electricity.\n\nThe energy content of the ethanol, $En_{eth}$, is the product of the ethanol yield per tonne of biomass, $Y_{eth} = 300 \\text{ L/t}$, and the Lower Heating Value (LHV) of ethanol, $LHV_{eth} = 21.1 \\text{ MJ/L}$.\n$$\nEn_{eth} = Y_{eth} \\times LHV_{eth} = 300 \\text{ L} \\times 21.1 \\frac{\\text{MJ}}{\\text{L}} = 6330 \\text{ MJ}\n$$\n\nThe energy content of the exported electricity, $En_{elec}$, is the product of the net electricity exported per tonne, $Q_{elec} = 0.60 \\text{ MWh/t}$, and the conversion factor from megawatt-hours to megajoules, $C_{conv} = 3600 \\text{ MJ/MWh}$.\n$$\nEn_{elec} = Q_{elec} \\times C_{conv} = 0.60 \\text{ MWh} \\times 3600 \\frac{\\text{MJ}}{\\text{MWh}} = 2160 \\text{ MJ}\n$$\n\nNow we can calculate the GHG intensity of ethanol for each of the two specified methods.\n\n**1. Energy Allocation Method**\n\nUnder the energy allocation approach, the total GHG burden ($E_{total}$) is distributed between the co-products in proportion to their respective energy contents. The total energy output of the system is $En_{total\\_alloc}$.\n$$\nEn_{total\\_alloc} = En_{eth} + En_{elec} = 6330 \\text{ MJ} + 2160 \\text{ MJ} = 8490 \\text{ MJ}\n$$\nThe fraction of the total energy attributed to ethanol is $f_{eth} = \\frac{En_{eth}}{En_{total\\_alloc}}$. The emissions allocated to ethanol, $E_{eth\\_alloc}$, are then $E_{total} \\times f_{eth}$.\nThe GHG intensity for ethanol under energy allocation, $I_{alloc}$, is the allocated emissions divided by the ethanol energy:\n$$\nI_{alloc} = \\frac{E_{eth\\_alloc}}{En_{eth}} = \\frac{E_{total} \\times \\frac{En_{eth}}{En_{total\\_alloc}}}{En_{eth}} = \\frac{E_{total}}{En_{total\\_alloc}}\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\nI_{alloc} = \\frac{420 \\text{ kg } \\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e}}{8490 \\text{ MJ}}\n$$\n\n**2. System Expansion Method**\n\nUnder the system expansion (or substitution) approach, the co-product (electricity) is assumed to displace an equivalent product on the market (grid electricity). This displacement results in an avoided emissions credit, $E_{credit}$, which is subtracted from the total system emissions. The grid-average GHG emission factor is given as $I_{grid} = 450 \\text{ kg } \\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e}/\\text{MWh}$.\nThe credit is calculated as:\n$$\nE_{credit} = Q_{elec} \\times I_{grid} = 0.60 \\text{ MWh} \\times 450 \\frac{\\text{kg } \\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e}}{\\text{MWh}} = 270 \\text{ kg } \\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e}\n$$\nThe net emissions for the system, $E_{net}$, are then attributed entirely to the main product, ethanol.\n$$\nE_{net} = E_{total} - E_{credit} = 420 \\text{ kg } \\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e} - 270 \\text{ kg } \\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e} = 150 \\text{ kg } \\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e}\n$$\nThe GHG intensity for ethanol under system expansion, $I_{exp}$, is these net emissions divided by the ethanol energy content.\n$$\nI_{exp} = \\frac{E_{net}}{En_{eth}} = \\frac{150 \\text{ kg } \\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e}}{6330 \\text{ MJ}}\n$$\n\n**3. Compute the Difference**\n\nThe problem asks for the difference, $D$, defined as the energy-allocation intensity minus the system-expansion intensity.\n$$\nD = I_{alloc} - I_{exp} = \\frac{420}{8490} \\frac{\\text{kg } \\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e}}{\\text{MJ}} - \\frac{150}{6330} \\frac{\\text{kg } \\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e}}{\\text{MJ}}\n$$\nTo express the result in grams of $\\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e}$ per megajoule (g $\\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e}$/MJ), we multiply by $1000 \\text{ g/kg}$.\n$$\nD \\left[\\frac{\\text{g } \\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e}}{\\text{MJ}}\\right] = \\left( \\frac{420}{8490} - \\frac{150}{6330} \\right) \\times 1000\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\nD = \\left( 0.04946996... - 0.02370000... \\right) \\times 1000\n$$\n$$\nD = (0.02576996...) \\times 1000 = 25.76996... \\frac{\\text{g } \\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e}}{\\text{MJ}}\n$$\nTo be more precise, we can use the fractional forms.
