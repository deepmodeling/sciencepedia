This exercise focuses on the principle of mass conservation within a reprocessing facility, a key step in a closed fuel cycle strategy. By tracking the flow of uranium and plutonium based on separation efficiencies, you will build a fundamental understanding of how valuable materials are recovered from spent fuel, which is the basis for evaluating the economic and resource implications of recycling .",

            "problem": "A reprocessing facility treats a single batch of spent nuclear fuel with total mass $M_{\\mathrm{in}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{kg}$. The spent fuel composition by mass is as follows: plutonium mass fraction $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{Pu}} = 0.01$, uranium mass fraction $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{U}} = 0.94$, and the remainder $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{R}} = 0.05$ represents fission products and minor actinides that are not targeted for recovery. The uranium present in the spent fuel has a residual uranium enrichment in uranium-$235$ of $y_{235} = 0.002$ (that is, a uranium-$235$ mass fraction of $0.002$ within the uranium). The plant recovers uranium and plutonium into separate product streams with separation efficiencies $\\eta_{\\mathrm{U}} = 0.99$ and $\\eta_{\\mathrm{Pu}} = 0.98$, where separation efficiency is defined as the fraction of the element’s feed mass that is collected in the respective product stream. Mixed Oxide (MOX) fuel fabrication downstream uses the recovered uranium and plutonium without further isotopic adjustment, and isotopic fractionation during separation is negligible.\n\nStarting from conservation of mass and the definition of separation efficiency, construct general mass flow equations for the recovered uranium and plutonium product streams in terms of $M_{\\mathrm{in}}$, $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{U}}$, $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{Pu}}$, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{U}}$, and $\\eta_{\\mathrm{Pu}}$. Also derive an expression for the mass of uranium-$235$ contained in the recovered uranium stream in terms of $y_{235}$ and the recovered uranium mass. Then evaluate these expressions numerically for the given batch.\n\nRound your numerical results to four significant figures. Express all masses in kilograms. Provide your final answer as a row matrix in the order $[m_{\\mathrm{U,rec}},\\ m_{\\mathrm{Pu,rec}},\\ m_{235,\\mathrm{rec}}]$, where $m_{\\mathrm{U,rec}}$ and $m_{\\mathrm{Pu,rec}}$ are the recovered uranium and plutonium masses, and $m_{235,\\mathrm{rec}}$ is the uranium-$235$ mass in the recovered uranium stream.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of mass conservation and standard nuclear fuel cycle modeling, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objective in its language. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of general mass flow equations for recovered uranium and plutonium, and for the mass of uranium-$235$ in the recovered uranium stream. These expressions will then be evaluated numerically.\n\nThe givens are:\nTotal initial mass of spent fuel: $M_{\\mathrm{in}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{kg}$\nMass fraction of uranium in the feed: $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{U}} = 0.94$\nMass fraction of plutonium in the feed: $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{Pu}} = 0.01$\nMass fraction of uranium-$235$ in the uranium: $y_{235} = 0.002$\nSeparation efficiency for uranium: $\\eta_{\\mathrm{U}} = 0.99$\nSeparation efficiency for plutonium: $\\eta_{\\mathrm{Pu}} = 0.98$\n\nFirst, we determine the initial mass of uranium and plutonium in the spent fuel batch before reprocessing.\nThe mass of uranium in the feed, $m_{\\mathrm{U,in}}$, is the product of the total mass $M_{\\mathrm{in}}$ and the uranium mass fraction $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{U}}$:\n$$m_{\\mathrm{U,in}} = \\alpha_{\\mathrm{U}} M_{\\mathrm{in}}$$\nThe mass of plutonium in the feed, $m_{\\mathrm{Pu,in}}$, is the product of the total mass $M_{\\mathrm{in}}$ and the plutonium mass fraction $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{Pu}}$:\n$$m_{\\mathrm{Pu,in}} = \\alpha_{\\mathrm{Pu}} M_{\\mathrm{in}}$$\n\nNext, we derive the general expressions for the recovered masses based on the definition of separation efficiency. The separation efficiency, $\\eta$, is defined as the fraction of an element's feed mass that is collected in the product stream.\n\nFor uranium, the mass of recovered uranium, $m_{\\mathrm{U,rec}}$, is given by the product of the uranium separation efficiency $\\eta_{\\mathrm{U}}$ and the initial mass of uranium in the feed $m_{\\mathrm{U,in}}$.\n$$m_{\\mathrm{U,rec}} = \\eta_{\\mathrm{U}} m_{\\mathrm{U,in}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $m_{\\mathrm{U,in}}$, we obtain the general mass flow equation for recovered uranium:\n$$m_{\\mathrm{U,rec}} = \\eta_{\\mathrm{U}} \\alpha_{\\mathrm{U}} M_{\\mathrm{in}}$$\n\nSimilarly, for plutonium, the mass of recovered plutonium, $m_{\\mathrm{Pu,rec}}$, is the product of the plutonium separation efficiency $\\eta_{\\mathrm{Pu}}$ and the initial mass of plutonium in the feed $m_{\\mathrm{Pu,in}}$.\n$$m_{\\mathrm{Pu,rec}} = \\eta_{\\mathrm{Pu}} m_{\\mathrm{Pu,in}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $m_{\\mathrm{Pu,in}}$, we obtain the general mass flow equation for recovered plutonium:\n$$m_{\\mathrm{Pu,rec}} = \\eta_{\\mathrm{Pu}} \\alpha_{\\mathrm{Pu}} M_{\\mathrm{in}}$$\n\nFinally, we derive the expression for the mass of uranium-$235$ in the recovered uranium stream, denoted $m_{235,\\mathrm{rec}}$. The problem states that isotopic fractionation during separation is negligible. This implies that the isotopic composition of the uranium is unchanged by the separation process. Therefore, the mass fraction of uranium-$235$ within the recovered uranium is the same as in the feed uranium, which is $y_{235}$. The mass of uranium-$235$ in the recovered stream is the product of the total mass of recovered uranium, $m_{\\mathrm{U,rec}}$, and this mass fraction, $y_{235}$.\n$$m_{235,\\mathrm{rec}} = y_{235} m_{\\mathrm{U,rec}}$$\nThis is the general expression for the mass of uranium-$235$ in terms of the recovered uranium mass.

Let the annual nameplate throughput be denoted by $Q_{\\mathrm{tHM}}$ in metric tonnes of heavy metal (tHM) per year, and let the utilization rate be denoted by $u \\in (0,1]$, defined as the ratio of effective throughput to nameplate throughput. The effective annual throughput in kilograms of heavy metal (kgHM) is $Q_{\\mathrm{eff}}=1000\\,u\\,Q_{\\mathrm{tHM}}$. The plant’s cost structure has two components: a constant marginal fabrication cost $a$ in dollars per kilogram of heavy metal ($\\$/\\mathrm{kgHM}$), and an annual fixed overhead $b$ in dollars ($\\$/\\mathrm{year}$).
