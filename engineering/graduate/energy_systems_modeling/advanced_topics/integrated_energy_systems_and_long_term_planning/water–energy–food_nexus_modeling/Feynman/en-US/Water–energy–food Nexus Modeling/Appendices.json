            "problem": "A field-scale water balance during a single growing season of an irrigated cereal crop is monitored to quantify the coupling between water supply, water consumption, and yield for water–energy–food nexus modeling. Your task is to formalize two commonly used performance metrics from first principles and compute them for the given field trial dataset.\n\nStart from conservation of mass for water over the control volume of the root-zone soil and crop canopy at the field scale. Assume vertical one-dimensional flow, negligible lateral inflows and outflows except surface runoff, and negligible capillary rise from groundwater. Use the season-integrated water balance to relate inflows and outflows to changes in root-zone storage and evapotranspiration.\n\nDefine and distinguish the following:\n1. Crop Water Productivity (CWP): yield per unit of water applied at the field inlet (irrigation application), expressed in $\\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}$.\n2. Water Use Efficiency (WUE) based on Evapotranspiration (ET): yield per unit of water consumed by evapotranspiration, expressed in $\\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}$.\n\nYou are provided the season-total observations for a single field plot:\n- Applied irrigation depth $I = 510\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Precipitation $P = 190\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Surface runoff $R = 25\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Deep percolation beyond the root zone $D = 60\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Change in root-zone soil water storage $\\Delta S = S_{\\mathrm{end}} - S_{\\mathrm{start}} = -35\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Harvested grain yield $Y = 7.8\\,\\mathrm{t/ha}$.\n\nTasks:\na) Using the season-integrated water balance, compute the season-total evapotranspiration $ET$.\nb) Compute $CWP$ and $WUE$, clearly stating units and any unit conversions used.

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically sound, well-posed, and complete. All necessary data, definitions, and assumptions are provided to reach a unique and meaningful solution. The principles involved, namely the conservation of mass applied to a hydrological system, are fundamental to the field. The provided data are physically plausible. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core of this problem is the application of the principle of conservation of mass to the water in a specified control volume, which encompasses the root-zone soil and the crop canopy. The season-integrated water balance equation relates all water inflows, outflows, and changes in storage over the growing season. The general form of the water balance equation is:\n$$\n\\text{Inflows} - \\text{Outflows} = \\text{Change in Storage}\n$$\nFor the given field-scale system, the inflows are Precipitation ($P$) and applied Irrigation ($I$). The outflows are Surface Runoff ($R$), Deep Percolation ($D$) beyond the root zone, and Evapotranspiration ($ET$). The change in storage is the change in root-zone soil water storage, $\\Delta S$. Based on the provided assumptions (negligible lateral flows and capillary rise), the water balance equation can be written as:\n$$\n(P + I) - (R + D + ET) = \\Delta S\n$$\nThe problem is divided into three tasks.\n\na) Compute the season-total evapotranspiration, $ET$.\nTo find $ET$, we rearrange the water balance equation:\n$$\nET = P + I - R - D - \\Delta S\n$$\nWe are given the following season-total values in units of water depth:\n- Applied irrigation depth, $I = 510\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n- Precipitation, $P = 190\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n- Surface runoff, $R = 25\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n- Deep percolation, $D = 60\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n- Change in root-zone soil water storage, $\\Delta S = -35\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $ET$:\n$$\nET = (190 + 510 - 25 - 60 - (-35))\\,\\mathrm{mm}\n$$\n$$\nET = (700 - 25 - 60 + 35)\\,\\mathrm{mm}\n$$\n$$\nET = (675 - 60 + 35)\\,\\mathrm{mm}\n$$\n$$\nET = (615 + 35)\\,\\mathrm{mm}\n$$\n$$\nET = 650\\,\\mathrm{mm}\n$$\nThe season-total evapotranspiration is $650\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nb) Compute Crop Water Productivity ($CWP$) and Water Use Efficiency ($WUE$) in $\\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}$.\nThe definitions provided are:\n1. $CWP = \\dfrac{\\text{Yield}}{\\text{Applied Irrigation Water}}$\n2. $WUE = \\dfrac{\\text{Yield}}{\\text{Evapotranspiration}}$\n\nTo express these metrics in units of $\\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}$, we need to express the yield as a mass ($\\mathrm{kg}$) and the water quantities as volumes ($\\mathrm{m^{3}}$). The problem provides data per unit area. Let $A$ be the field area. The total yield mass is $Y_{\\text{mass}} = Y_A \\times A$, where $Y_A$ is the yield per unit area. The total water volume is $V = d \\times A$, where $d$ is the water depth. The metrics are thus computed as the ratio of yield per unit area to water depth, as the area term $A$ cancels out.\n$$\nCWP = \\frac{Y_A \\times A}{I \\times A} = \\frac{Y_A}{I}\n$$\n$$\nWUE = \\frac{Y_A \\times A}{ET \\times A} = \\frac{Y_A}{ET}\n$$\nFirst, we convert the units of yield, $Y$, and water depths, $I$ and $ET$, to a consistent system ($ \\mathrm{kg} $, $ \\mathrm{m} $).\n\nThe harvested grain yield is given as $Y = 7.8\\,\\mathrm{t/ha}$.

The units will be $(\\mathrm{kg/m^2}) / (\\mathrm{m})$, which simplifies to $\\mathrm{kg/m^3}$.\n$$\nCWP = \\frac{Y_A}{I} = \\frac{0.78\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^2}}{0.510\\,\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{0.78}{0.510}\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^3} \\approx 1.5294\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^3}\n$$\n$$\nWUE = \\frac{Y_A}{ET} = \\frac{0.78\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^2}}{0.650\\,\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{0.78}{0.650}\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^3} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^3}\n$$\n\nc) Report the ratio $\\dfrac{WUE}{CWP}$.\nUsing the expressions for $WUE$ and $CWP$ derived above:\n$$\n\\frac{WUE}{CWP} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{Y_A}{ET}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{Y_A}{I}\\right)}\n$$\nThe yield per unit area term, $Y_A$, cancels out, leaving a ratio of water depths:\n$$\n\\frac{WUE}{CWP} = \\frac{I}{ET}\n$$\nThis ratio is dimensionless, as both $I$ and $ET$ have units of depth. We can use the values in millimeters directly:\n$$\n\\frac{WUE}{CWP} = \\frac{510\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{650\\,\\mathrm{mm}} = \\frac{51}{65}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value of this fraction:\n$$\n\\frac{51}{65} \\approx 0.78461538...\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\frac{WUE}{CWP} \\approx 0.7846\n$$\nThis dimensionless ratio indicates that for every unit of water applied through irrigation, approximately $78.46\\%$ was productively consumed as evapotranspiration.

This can be formulated as a Linear Programming (LP) model.\n\n**Decision Variables**\nLet the decision variables be the production throughputs for each plant, measured in tons:\n- $x_A$: tons of product from Plant $A$.\n- $x_B$: tons of product from Plant $B$.\n- $x_C$: tons of product from Plant $C$.\nBy definition, production quantities must be non-negative: $x_A \\geq 0$, $x_B \\geq 0$, $x_C \\geq 0$.\n\n**Objective Function**\nThe objective is to minimize the total cost $Z$, which is the sum of variable operating costs and resource procurement costs (water and electricity).\n\nFirst, we calculate the total unit cost for one ton of product from each plant. This total unit cost is the sum of the operating cost per ton and the costs of water and electricity required per ton.\n\n- **Total Unit Cost for Plant A ($c_A$)**:\n$c_A = (\\text{Op. Cost}) + (\\text{Water Intensity} \\times \\text{Water Price}) + (\\text{Elec. Intensity} \\times \\text{Elec. Price})$\n$c_A = 5 \\, \\$/\\mathrm{ton} + (10 \\, \\mathrm{m}^3/\\mathrm{ton} \\times 0.05 \\, \\$/\\mathrm{m}^3) + (15 \\, \\mathrm{kWh}/\\mathrm{ton} \\times 0.10 \\, \\$/\\mathrm{kWh})$\n$c_A = 5 + 0.5 + 1.5 = 7.0 \\, \\$/\\mathrm{ton}$\n\n- **Total Unit Cost for Plant B ($c_B$)**:\n$c_B = 4 \\, \\$/\\mathrm{ton} + (8 \\, \\mathrm{m}^3/\\mathrm{ton} \\times 0.05 \\, \\$/\\mathrm{m}^3) + (20 \\, \\mathrm{kWh}/\\mathrm{ton} \\times 0.10 \\, \\$/\\mathrm{kWh})$\n$c_B = 4 + 0.4 + 2.0 = 6.4 \\, \\$/\\mathrm{ton}$\n\n- **Total Unit Cost for Plant C ($c_C$)**:\n$c_C = 6 \\, \\$/\\mathrm{ton} + (12 \\, \\mathrm{m}^3/\\mathrm{ton} \\times 0.05 \\, \\$/\\mathrm{m}^3) + (12 \\, \\mathrm{kWh}/\\mathrm{ton} \\times 0.10 \\, \\$/\\mathrm{kWh})$\n$c_C = 6 + 0.6 + 1.2 = 7.8 \\, \\$/\\mathrm{ton}$\n\nThe total cost $Z$ is the sum of the costs from each plant:\n$Z = c_A x_A + c_B x_B + c_C x_C$\n\nThe final objective function to be minimized is:\n$$ \\text{Minimize} \\quad Z = 7.0 x_A + 6.4 x_B + 7.8 x_C $$\n\n**Constraints**\nThe production levels are subject to several constraints:\n\n1.  **Freshwater Availability**: The total freshwater used cannot exceed the available amount.\n    $$ 10 x_A + 8 x_B + 12 x_C \\leq 3300 $$\n\n2.  **Electricity Availability**: The total electricity consumed cannot exceed the available amount.\n    $$ 15 x_A + 20 x_B + 12 x_C \\leq 4500 $$\n\n3.  **Demand Requirement**: The total production must meet the minimum demand.\n    $$ x_A + x_B + x_C \\geq 300 $$\n\n4.  **Production Capacities**: Each plant has a maximum production capacity.\n    $$ x_A \\leq 120 $$\n    $$ x_B \\leq 150 $$\n    $$ x_C \\leq 130 $$\n\n5.  **Non-negativity**: Production quantities cannot be negative.\n    $$ x_A \\geq 0, \\quad x_B \\geq 0, \\quad x_C \\geq 0 $$\n\n### Task 2: Solving the Linear Program\n\nTo solve this LP, we first observe that the objective function coefficients ($7.0$, $6.4$, $7.8$) are all positive. Therefore, to minimize the cost, production should not exceed the minimum required to meet demand. Any production beyond $300$ tons would unnecessarily increase the total cost. Thus, at the optimal solution, the demand constraint will be binding:\n$$ x_A + x_B + x_C = 300 $$\n\nThis allows us to reduce the dimensionality of the problem by expressing one variable in terms of the other two. Let $x_C = 300 - x_A - x_B$. Substituting this into the objective function and constraints yields a two-variable LP problem.\n\nThe objective becomes minimizing $Z = 7.0 x_A + 6.4 x_B + 7.8 (300 - x_A - x_B)$, which simplifies to minimizing $Z = 2340 - 0.8 x_A - 1.4 x_B$. This is equivalent to maximizing $P = 0.8 x_A + 1.4 x_B$.\n\nThe constraints in terms of $x_A$ and $x_B$ are:\n1.  $10 x_A + 8 x_B + 12 (300 - x_A - x_B) \\leq 3300 \\implies x_A + 2x_B \\geq 150$\n2.  $15 x_A + 20 x_B + 12 (300 - x_A - x_B) \\leq 4500 \\implies 3x_A + 8x_B \\leq 900$\n3.  $x_A \\leq 120$\n4.  $x_B \\leq 150$\n5.  From $0 \\leq x_C \\leq 130$:\n    $0 \\leq 300 - x_A - x_B \\implies x_A + x_B \\leq 300$\n    $300 - x_A - x_B \\leq 130 \\implies x_A + x_B \\geq 170$\n6.  $x_A \\geq 0, \\quad x_B \\geq 0$\n\nSolving this 2D LP problem (e.g., by examining the vertices of the feasible region) shows that the function $P$ is maximized at the vertex defined by the intersection of the constraints $x_A \\leq 120$ and $3x_A + 8x_B \\leq 900$. At this vertex, the constraints are binding:\n$$ x_A = 120 $$\n$$ 3(120) + 8x_B = 900 \\implies 360 + 8x_B = 900 \\implies 8x_B = 540 \\implies x_B = 67.5 $$\n\nNow, we can find the value of $x_C$:\n$$ x_C = 300 - x_A - x_B = 300 - 120 - 67.5 = 112.5 $$\n\nThe optimal production plan is $(x_A, x_B, x_C) = (120, 67.5, 112.5)$. We verify that this solution is feasible with respect to all original constraints:\n- Capacities: $120 \\leq 120$ (binding), $67.5 \\leq 150$ (slack), $112.5 \\leq 130$ (slack). All valid.\n- Demand: $120 + 67.5 + 112.5 = 300 \\geq 300$ (binding). Valid.\n- Water: $10(120) + 8(67.5) + 12(112.5) = 1200 + 540 + 1350 = 3090 \\leq 3300$ (slack). Valid.\n- Electricity: $15(120) + 20(67.5) + 12(112.5) = 1800 + 1350 + 1350 = 4500 \\leq 4500$ (binding). Valid.\n\nThe solution is feasible. The minimal total cost $Z_{min}$ is calculated by substituting these production values into the objective function:\n$$ Z_{min} = 7.0 x_A + 6.4 x_B + 7.8 x_C $$\n$$ Z_{min} = 7.0(120) + 6.4(67.5) + 7.8(112.5) $$\n$$ Z_{min} = 840 + 432 + 877.5 $$\n$$ Z_{min} = 2149.5 $$\n\nThe exact minimal total cost is $2149.50$ dollars.",

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and the conservation of mass and energy. It is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary data for a unique solution. The provided data are physically realistic and dimensionally consistent.\n\nThis problem requires a two-part response. The first part is a conceptual delineation of attributional and consequential LCA methodologies. The second part is a quantitative calculation of net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using the consequential LCA framework.\n\n**1. Conceptual Delineation of LCA Methodologies**\n\nAttributional Life Cycle Assessment (ALCA) and Consequential Life Cycle Assessment (CLCA) are two distinct approaches for conducting an LCA. Their differences are most pronounced in the context of decision-making, such as the proposed expansion of a recycled water system. The core distinctions are as follows:\n\n- **System Boundary:** ALCA employs a static system boundary that typically encompasses the processes directly involved in the life cycle of a product or service. For this problem, an ALCA would focus on accounting for the flows and emissions associated with the recycled water treatment and distribution system itself. It aims to describe the environmentally relevant physical flows *of* a system. In contrast, CLCA utilizes an expanded, dynamic system boundary. It seeks to identify and include all processes in the global technosphere that are affected by the decision. This includes not only the new processes (recycled water system) but also the processes that are displaced or altered, such as the marginal electricity generators that respond to the change in load and the alternative water and fertilizer sources that are substituted. CLCA aims to describe the environmental consequences *of* a system change.\n\n- **Technology Representation (Average vs. Marginal):** Consistent with its descriptive goal, ALCA typically uses average data to represent background processes. For example, to calculate emissions from electricity, ALCA would use the average emission factor of the entire electricity grid mix, reflecting the proportional contribution of all power plants on the grid. CLCA, being focused on the consequences of change, uses marginal data. It identifies the specific technologies that are expected to change in response to a small perturbation in demand. For electricity, this is the marginal generator—the power plant(s) that would increase or decrease their output to meet the incremental load change from the project. This is represented by the marginal emission factor, $\\mathrm{EF}_{\\mathrm{marg}}$.\n\n- **Treatment of Market-Mediated Substitutions:** ALCA is fundamentally an accounting framework and generally does not model market-mediated effects. It allocates the burdens of a multi-output process without considering how a change in one output might affect others through market mechanisms. CLCA, by its nature, is centered on these substitutions. The core of a consequential analysis for this problem is to model how the introduction of $25{,}000\\ \\mathrm{m^3/day}$ of recycled water *causes* a decrease in demand for the marginal water source (groundwater) and a decrease in demand for the marginal source of nitrogen (synthetic fertilizer). The environmental burdens avoided by these substitutions are credited to the recycled water system.\n\n**2. Calculation of Marginal Annual GHG Emissions**\n\nThe calculation proceeds under the consequential LCA framework. The net annual GHG emissions, $\\mathrm{GHG}_{\\mathrm{net}}$, are the sum of all new emissions caused by the project minus the sum of all avoided emissions resulting from the displacement of other activities.\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{GHG}_{\\mathrm{net}} = \\mathrm{GHG}_{\\mathrm{added}} - \\mathrm{GHG}_{\\mathrm{avoided}}\n$$\n\nThe added emissions stem from the electricity used for treating and distributing the new recycled water. The avoided emissions (or credits) come from two sources: the displaced groundwater pumping and the displaced production of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer.\n\nLet's define the given parameters:\n- Incremental daily reuse capacity: $\\Delta Q = 25{,}000\\ \\mathrm{m^3/day}$\n- Incremental treatment electricity intensity: $E_{\\mathrm{treat}} = 0.65\\ \\mathrm{kWh/m^3}$\n- Incremental distribution electricity intensity: $E_{\\mathrm{dist}} = 0.12\\ \\mathrm{kWh/m^3}$\n- Marginal electricity GHG emission factor: $\\mathrm{EF}_{\\mathrm{marg}} = 0.58\\ \\mathrm{kg\\ CO_2e/kWh}$\n- Alternative (groundwater) electricity intensity: $E_{\\mathrm{alt}} = 0.53\\ \\mathrm{kWh/m^3}$\n- Nitrogen concentration in recycled water: $C_{N} = 15\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$\n- Plant-available fraction of nitrogen: $f_{N} = 0.70$\n- Synthetic nitrogen fertilizer GHG emission factor: $\\mathrm{EF}_{N} = 6.1\\ \\mathrm{kg\\ CO_2e/kg\\ N}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the net change in emissions from electricity. The annual volume of water, assuming year-round operation for $365$ days, is:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{annual}} = \\Delta Q \\times 365\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{days}}{\\mathrm{year}} = 25{,}000\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{m}^3}{\\mathrm{day}} \\times 365\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{days}}{\\mathrm{year}} = 9{,}125{,}000\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{m}^3}{\\mathrm{year}}\n$$\nThe total electricity intensity of the new reuse system is the sum of treatment and distribution intensities:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{reuse}} = E_{\\mathrm{treat}} + E_{\\mathrm{dist}} = 0.65\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{kWh}}{\\mathrm{m}^3} + 0.12\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{kWh}}{\\mathrm{m}^3} = 0.77\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{kWh}}{\\mathrm{m}^3}\n$$\nThe net change in electricity intensity is the intensity of the new system minus the intensity of the displaced system:\n$$\n\\Delta E = E_{\\mathrm{reuse}} - E_{\\mathrm{alt}} = 0.77\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{kWh}}{\\mathrm{m}^3} - 0.53\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{kWh}}{\\mathrm{m}^3} = 0.24\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{kWh}}{\\mathrm{m}^3}\n$$\nThe net annual GHG emissions from electricity, $\\mathrm{GHG}_{\\mathrm{net,elec}}$, are then:\n$$\n\\mathrm{GHG}_{\\mathrm{net,elec}} = V_{\\mathrm{annual}} \\times \\Delta E \\times \\mathrm{EF}_{\\mathrm{marg}}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{GHG}_{\\mathrm{net,elec}} = 9{,}125{,}000\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{m}^3}{\\mathrm{year}} \\times 0.24\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{kWh}}{\\mathrm{m}^3} \\times 0.58\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{kg\\ CO_2e}}{\\mathrm{kWh}} = 1{,}270{,}200\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{kg\\ CO_2e}}{\\mathrm{year}}\n$$\nThis positive value represents a net increase in emissions from electricity-related activities.\n\nNext, we calculate the avoided emissions from displacing synthetic fertilizer. First, we determine the annual mass of plant-available nitrogen, $M_{N,\\mathrm{avail}}$, delivered by the recycled water. We must convert the concentration $C_N$ from $\\mathrm{mg/L}$ to $\\mathrm{kg/m^3}$:\n$$\nC_N = 15\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{L}} \\times \\frac{1\\ \\mathrm{kg}}{10^6\\ \\mathrm{mg}} \\times \\frac{1000\\ \\mathrm{L}}{1\\ \\mathrm{m^3}} = 0.015\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{kg}}{\\mathrm{m^3}}\n$$\nThe annual mass of plant-available nitrogen is:\n$$\nM_{N,\\mathrm{avail}} = V_{\\mathrm{annual}} \\times C_N \\times f_N\n$$\n$$\nM_{N,\\mathrm{avail}} = 9{,}125{,}000\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{m}^3}{\\mathrm{year}} \\times 0.015\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{kg\\ N}}{\\mathrm{m}^3} \\times 0.70 = 95{,}812.5\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{kg\\ N}}{\\mathrm{year}}\n$$\nThe GHG emissions avoided by not producing this mass of synthetic fertilizer, $\\mathrm{GHG}_{\\mathrm{avoided,fert}}$, are:\n$$\n\\mathrm{GHG}_{\\mathrm{avoided,fert}} = M_{N,\\mathrm{avail}} \\times \\mathrm{EF}_N\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{GHG}_{\\mathrm{avoided,fert}} = 95{,}812.5\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{kg\\ N}}{\\mathrm{year}} \\times 6.1\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{kg\\ CO_2e}}{\\mathrm{kg\\ N}} = 584{,}456.25\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{kg\\ CO_2e}}{\\mathrm{year}}\n$$\nThis is an emissions credit. The total net annual emissions are the net electricity emissions minus the fertilizer credit:\n$$\n\\mathrm{GHG}_{\\mathrm{net}} = \\mathrm{GHG}_{\\mathrm{net,elec}} - \\mathrm{GHG}_{\\mathrm{avoided,fert}}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{GHG}_{\\mathrm{net}} = 1{,}270{,}200\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{kg\\ CO_2e}}{\\mathrm{year}} - 584{,}456.25\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{kg\\ CO_2e}}{\\mathrm{year}} = 685{,}743.75\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{kg\\ CO_2e}}{\\mathrm{year}}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the result in tonnes of $\\mathrm{CO_2e}$ per year. Since $1\\ \\mathrm{tonne} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{kg}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{GHG}_{\\mathrm{net}} = \\frac{685{,}743.75}{1000}\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{t\\ CO_2e}}{\\mathrm{year}} = 685.74375\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{t\\ CO_2e}}{\\mathrm{year}}\n$$\nRounding this value to $3$ significant figures gives:\n$$\n\\mathrm{GHG}_{\\mathrm{net}} \\approx 686\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{t\\ CO_2e}}{\\mathrm{year}}\n$$\nThe positive result indicates that, under the given assumptions, the expansion project leads to a net increase in annual GHG emissions.",
