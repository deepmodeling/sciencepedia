The unit’s steady operating point over a one-hour dispatch interval is an electrical power output of $P=400$ MW. The CCGT’s gross heat rate is modeled over the valid operating range by a linear load-dependent function $HR(P)=a+bP$, where $HR(P)$ is the fuel energy input per unit electrical energy output.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a complete and consistent set of data and definitions from the field of energy systems engineering, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution. The provided parameters for the combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) are realistic. Therefore, a full solution is warranted.\n\nThe core of the problem is to relate the electrical power output of the CCGT to its volumetric rate of natural gas consumption. This is achieved by applying the definitions of heat rate and the energy content of the fuel.\n\nThe heat rate, $HR(P)$, is defined as the fuel energy input per unit of electrical energy output. For a steady operating point, this can be expressed as the ratio of the fuel energy input rate, $\\dot{E}_{\\text{fuel}}$, to the electrical power output, $P$.\n$$HR(P) = \\frac{\\dot{E}_{\\text{fuel}}}{P}$$\nThe units given for the variables are consistent with this definition. The electrical power output $P$ is in megawatts (MW), the heat rate $HR(P)$ is in megajoules per megawatt-hour (MJ/MWh), and the fuel energy rate $\\dot{E}_{\\text{fuel}}$ can thus be expressed in megajoules per hour (MJ/h), since $1\\,\\mathrm{MW} = 1\\,\\mathrm{MWh/h}$.\nTherefore, the fuel energy consumption rate can be calculated as:\n$$\\dot{E}_{\\text{fuel}} = HR(P) \\times P$$\nThe problem states that the heat rate is a linear function of the power output:\n$$HR(P) = a + bP$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the fuel energy rate gives:\n$$\\dot{E}_{\\text{fuel}} = (a + bP) P$$\nThe next step is to relate this energy consumption rate to the volumetric gas consumption rate, $\\dot{V}_{\\text{gas}}$. The Higher Heating Value, $\\mathrm{HHV}$, of the natural gas provides the link. It is defined as the energy released per unit volume of fuel.\n$$\\mathrm{HHV} = \\frac{\\text{Energy}}{\\text{Volume}}$$\nIn terms of rates, this becomes:\n$$\\mathrm{HHV} = \\frac{\\dot{E}_{\\text{fuel}}}{\\dot{V}_{\\text{gas}}}$$\nThe units are consistent: $\\mathrm{HHV}$ is in $\\mathrm{MJ/m}^3$, $\\dot{E}_{\\text{fuel}}$ is in MJ/h, and $\\dot{V}_{\\text{gas}}$ would be in $\\text{m}^3/\\text{h}$.\nRearranging this equation to solve for the volumetric gas consumption rate yields:\n$$\\dot{V}_{\\text{gas}} = \\frac{\\dot{E}_{\\text{fuel}}}{\\mathrm{HHV}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\dot{E}_{\\text{fuel}}$, we obtain the final formula for the gas consumption rate in terms of the given parameters:\n$$\\dot{V}_{\\text{gas}} = \\frac{(a + bP) P}{\\mathrm{HHV}}$$\nThe problem provides the following values:\n-   Electrical power output: $P = 400 \\text{ MW}$\n-   Heat rate parameter $a$: $a = 7.5 \\times 10^3\\ \\text{MJ/MWh}$\n-   Heat rate parameter $b$: $b = -0.8\\ \\text{MJ/(MWh}\\cdot\\text{MW)}$\n-   Higher Heating Value: $\\mathrm{HHV} = 38\\ \\text{MJ/m}^3$\n\nFirst, we calculate the specific heat rate at the operating point $P=400$ MW:\n$$HR(400\\ \\text{MW}) = (7.5 \\times 10^3) + (-0.8) \\times 400$$\n$$HR(400\\ \\text{MW}) = 7500 - 320 = 7180 \\text{ MJ/MWh}$$\nNext, we calculate the total fuel energy consumption rate, $\\dot{E}_{\\text{fuel}}$:\n$$\\dot{E}_{\\text{fuel}} = HR(400\\ \\text{MW}) \\times P = 7180 \\frac{\\text{MJ}}{\\text{MWh}} \\times 400 \\text{ MW} = 2,872,000 \\frac{\\text{MJ}}{\\text{h}}$$\nFinally, we compute the volumetric natural gas consumption rate, $\\dot{V}_{\\text{gas}}$, by dividing the fuel energy rate by the Higher Heating Value:\n$$\\dot{V}_{\\text{gas}} = \\frac{2,872,000\\ \\text{MJ/h}}{38\\ \\text{MJ/m}^3}$$\n$$\\dot{V}_{\\text{gas}} \\approx 75578.947368...\\ \\text{m}^3/\\text{h}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

The pressure values are typical for transmission pipelines.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in energy systems engineering. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe derivation begins with the one-dimensional steady-state momentum balance for a differential element of the pipeline of length $dx$. Neglecting changes in momentum flux, which is a standard and accurate assumption for long pipelines with subsonic flow, the balance between pressure force and frictional force is:\n$$A dp + \\tau_w P dx = 0$$\nwhere $dp$ is the differential pressure change, $A$ is the cross-sectional area, $\\tau_w$ is the wall shear stress, and $P$ is the wetted perimeter.\n\nThe wall shear stress is related to the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor $f$ by:\n$$\\tau_w = \\frac{f}{8} \\rho v^2$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the gas density and $v$ is the flow velocity. The pipeline geometry gives $A = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}$ and $P = \\pi D$, so the ratio $\\frac{P}{A} = \\frac{4}{D}$. Substituting these into the momentum balance yields:\n$$A dp + \\left(\\frac{f}{8} \\rho v^2\\right) (\\pi D) dx = 0$$\n$$dp = -\\frac{f}{8} \\rho v^2 \\frac{\\pi D}{A} dx = -\\frac{f}{2D} \\rho v^2 dx$$\nThe mass flow rate $\\dot{m}$ is constant in steady state: $\\dot{m} = \\rho A v$. Thus, the velocity is $v = \\frac{\\dot{m}}{\\rho A}$. Substituting for $v$:\n$$dp = -\\frac{f}{2D} \\rho \\left(\\frac{\\dot{m}}{\\rho A}\\right)^2 dx = -\\frac{f \\dot{m}^2}{2DA^2} \\frac{1}{\\rho} dx$$\nThe gas is described by the real gas law, $p = Z \\rho R_s T$. We can express the density term $\\frac{1}{\\rho}$ as:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\rho} = \\frac{Z R_s T}{p}$$\nSubstituting this into the differential equation for pressure gives:\n$$dp = -\\frac{f \\dot{m}^2}{2DA^2} \\frac{Z R_s T}{p} dx$$\nThis is a separable ordinary differential equation. We rearrange it to integrate over the length of the pipeline, from $x=0$ (where $p = p_u$) to $x=L$ (where $p = p_g$):\n$$p \\, dp = -\\frac{f Z R_s T \\dot{m}^2}{2DA^2} dx$$\n$$\\int_{p_u}^{p_g} p \\, dp = -\\frac{f Z R_s T \\dot{m}^2}{2DA^2} \\int_{0}^{L} dx$$\nThe parameters $f$, $Z$, $R_s$, $T$, $\\dot{m}$, $D$, and $A$ are assumed constant along the pipeline. Integrating both sides yields:\n$$\\frac{p_g^2}{2} - \\frac{p_u^2}{2} = -\\frac{f L Z R_s T \\dot{m}^2}{2DA^2}$$\nMultiplying by $-2$ gives the pressure-flow coupling relation for the pipeline:\n$$p_u^2 - p_g^2 = \\frac{f L Z R_s T \\dot{m}^2}{DA^2}$$\nSubstituting $A = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}$, so $A^2 = \\frac{\\pi^2 D^4}{16}$:\n$$p_u^2 - p_g^2 = \\frac{f L Z R_s T \\dot{m}^2}{D (\\frac{\\pi^2 D^4}{16})} = \\frac{16 f L Z R_s T}{\\pi^2 D^5} \\dot{m}^2$$\nThis is the required steady-state pipeline coupling constraint.\n\nNext, we relate the mass flow rate $\\dot{m}$ to the electrical power output $P_e$. The thermal power input from the fuel is $P_{th} = \\dot{m} \\cdot \\mathrm{LHV}$. The generator converts this to electricity with efficiency $\\eta$:\n$$P_e = \\eta P_{th} = \\eta \\dot{m} \\mathrm{LHV}$$\nFrom this, we can express the mass flow rate required for a given power output:\n$$\\dot{m} = \\frac{P_e}{\\eta \\mathrm{LHV}}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\dot{m}$ into the pipeline equation:\n$$p_u^2 - p_g^2 = \\frac{16 f L Z R_s T}{\\pi^2 D^5} \\left(\\frac{P_e}{\\eta \\mathrm{LHV}}\\right)^2$$\nWe are asked to find the maximum feasible electric power output, $P_e^{\\max}$. Solving for $P_e$:\n$$P_e = (\\eta \\mathrm{LHV}) \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi^2 D^5}{16 f L Z R_s T} (p_u^2 - p_g^2)}$$\nTo maximize $P_e$, we must maximize the term under the square root, specifically the pressure difference term $(p_u^2 - p_g^2)$, subject to the constraints $p_u \\leq p_u^{\\max}$ and $p_g \\geq p_g^{\\min}$.\n\nThe function $F(p_u, p_g) = p_u^2 - p_g^2$ is monotonically increasing with $p_u$ (since $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial p_u} = 2p_u > 0$) and monotonically decreasing with $p_g$ (since $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial p_g} = -2p_g < 0$). Therefore, to maximize $F$, we must choose the highest possible value for $p_u$ and the lowest possible value for $p_g$. These are given by the bounds:\n$$p_u = p_u^{\\max}$$\n$$p_g = p_g^{\\min}$$\nThus, at maximum power output, both the upstream pressure limit and the downstream pressure limit are binding constraints.\n\nNow we calculate the numerical value for $P_e^{\\max}$. Let's define a constant for the pipeline characteristics:\n$$C_p = \\frac{16 f L Z R_s T}{\\pi^2 D^5}$$\nUsing the given values:\n- $f = 0.02$\n- $L = 60000\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $Z = 0.90$\n- $R_{s} = 518\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n- $T = 288\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- $D = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$$C_p = \\frac{16(0.02)(60000)(0.90)(518)(288)}{\\pi^2 (0.30)^5} = \\frac{2,577,692,160}{9.8696 \\times 0.00243} \\approx \\frac{2.5777 \\times 10^9}{0.023983} \\approx 1.0748 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$$\nThe maximum squared pressure difference is:\n$$(p_{u}^{\\max})^2 - (p_{g}^{\\min})^2 = (5.5 \\times 10^6)^2 - (4.8 \\times 10^6)^2 = (30.25 - 23.04) \\times 10^{12} = 7.21 \\times 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}^2$$\nThe maximum squared mass flow is:\n$$\\dot{m}_{\\max}^2 = \\frac{(p_{u}^{\\max})^2 - (p_{g}^{\\min})^2}{C_p} = \\frac{7.21 \\times 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}^2}{1.0748 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\mathrm{s}^{-2}} \\approx 67.085\\,\\mathrm{kg}^2\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$$\nThe maximum mass flow rate is:\n$$\\dot{m}_{\\max} = \\sqrt{67.085\\,\\mathrm{kg}^2\\mathrm{s}^{-2}} \\approx 8.1905\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nFinally, the maximum electric power output is:\n$$P_e^{\\max} = \\eta \\dot{m}_{\\max} \\mathrm{LHV} = (0.58) (8.1905\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) (49 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1})$$\n$$P_e^{\\max} \\approx 232,716,000\\,\\mathrm{W} = 232.716\\,\\mathrm{MW}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the maximum power output is $233\\,\\mathrm{MW}$.",

The analysis proceeds in two parts: first, determining the maximum approximation error of the surrogate model, and second, quantifying the power generation reduction due to this approximation under a binding pressure constraint.\n\nThe foundational physical relations are:\n1.  The Weymouth relation for steady-state gas flow: $p_{\\mathrm{in}}^2 - p_{\\mathrm{out}}^2 = \\beta q^2$. Here, $p_{\\mathrm{in}}$ is the inlet pressure, $p_{\\mathrm{out}}$ is the outlet pressure, $q$ is the volumetric flow rate at standard conditions, and $\\beta$ is the pipeline's Weymouth coefficient.\n2.

The flow range is $q \\in [0, 40]$.\n\n**Part 1: Maximum Absolute Approximation Error**\n\nThe function to be approximated is $f(q) = \\beta q^2$. Since the coefficient $\\beta = 0.011$ is positive, $f(q)$ is a strictly convex function for $q \\ge 0$. The PWL surrogate is formed by chords connecting points on this convex curve. A chord connecting two points on a convex function lies on or below the function's curve. Therefore, the approximation error, $E(q) = f(q) - f_{\\mathrm{PWL}}(q)$, is non-negative, and the absolute error is equal to $E(q)$.\n\nConsider a single segment of the approximation over the interval $[a, b]$. The line constituting the surrogate passes through the points $(a, f(a))$ and $(b, f(b))$.

We evaluate the surrogate at the breakpoints:\n    $$f_{\\mathrm{PWL}}(q_0=0) = \\beta \\cdot 0^2 = 0$$\n    $$f_{\\mathrm{PWL}}(q_1=20) = \\beta \\cdot 20^2 = 0.011 \\cdot 400 = 4.4 \\, \\mathrm{MPa}^2$$\n    $$f_{\\mathrm{PWL}}(q_2=40) = \\beta \\cdot 40^2 = 0.011 \\cdot 1600 = 17.6 \\, \\mathrm{MPa}^2$$\n    Since $4.4 < 11 < 17.6$, the solution $q_{\\mathrm{pwl}}$ must lie on the second segment, between $q_1 = 20$ and $q_2 = 40$. The equation for this line connects the points $(20, 4.4)$ and $(40, 17.6)$. The slope $m$ is:\n    $$m = \\frac{17.6 - 4.4}{40 - 20} = \\frac{13.2}{20} = 0.66 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{MPa}^2}{\\mathrm{Sm}^3/\\mathrm{s}}$$\n    The line equation is $f_{\\mathrm{PWL}}(q) - 4.4 = 0.66(q - 20)$. We set $f_{\\mathrm{PWL}}(q_{\\mathrm{pwl}}) = 11$:\n    $$11 - 4.4 = 0.66(q_{\\mathrm{pwl}} - 20)$$\n    $$6.6 = 0.66(q_{\\mathrm{pwl}} - 20)$$\n    $$q_{\\mathrm{pwl}} - 20 = \\frac{6.6}{0.66} = 10$$\n    $$q_{\\mathrm{pwl}} = 30 \\, \\mathrm{Sm}^3/\\mathrm{s}$$\n\nThe surrogate model, by underestimating the true pressure drop for a given flow, leads an optimizer to conclude that the maximum feasible flow is $q_{\\mathrm{pwl}} = 30 \\, \\mathrm{Sm}^3/\\mathrm{s}$. The true physical maximum is $q_{\\mathrm{exact}} = 10\\sqrt{10} \\approx 31.62 \\, \\mathrm{Sm}^3/\\mathrm{s}$. The use of the surrogate thus causes a reduction in the identified feasible operating range.\n\nThe reduction in electric power, $\\Delta P$, is the difference between the power that could be generated at the true maximum flow and the power generated at the maximum flow allowed by the surrogate model.\n$$\\Delta P = P_{\\mathrm{exact}} - P_{\\mathrm{pwl}} = \\eta H q_{\\mathrm{exact}} - \\eta H q_{\\mathrm{pwl}} = \\eta H (q_{\\mathrm{exact}} - q_{\\mathrm{pwl}})$$\n\nWe are given $\\eta = 0.55$ and $H = 35.8 \\, \\mathrm{MJ}/\\mathrm{Sm}^3$. The product $\\eta H q$ gives power in MW, since $1 \\, \\mathrm{MJ}/\\mathrm{s} = 1 \\, \\mathrm{MW}$.\n$$\\Delta P = (0.55 \\times 35.8) \\times (\\sqrt{1000} - 30) \\, \\mathrm{MW}$$\n$$\\Delta P = 19.69 \\times (\\sqrt{1000} - 30) \\, \\mathrm{MW}$$\nUsing the numerical value for $\\sqrt{1000}$:\n$$\\Delta P \\approx 19.69 \\times (31.6227766 - 30) \\, \\mathrm{MW}$$\n$$\\Delta P \\approx 19.69 \\times 1.6227766 \\, \\mathrm{MW}$$\n$$\\Delta P \\approx 31.95400... \\, \\mathrm{MW}$$\n\nRounding to four significant figures as required, the magnitude of the electric power reduction is $31.95 \\, \\mathrm{MW}$.",
