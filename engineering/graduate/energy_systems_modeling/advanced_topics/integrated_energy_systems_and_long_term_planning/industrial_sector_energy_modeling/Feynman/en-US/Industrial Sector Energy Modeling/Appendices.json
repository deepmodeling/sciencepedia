First, the emission factor for the refinery fuel gas is derived from first principles. Second, the total annual emissions are calculated by summing the contributions from each of the three combustion sources and the purchased electricity.\n\n#### Task 1: Derivation of the Emission Factor for Refinery Fuel Gas (RFG)\n\nThe emission factor, $EF_{RFG}$, is the mass of $\\text{CO}_2$ emitted per unit of energy released, where energy is given by the Lower Heating Value (LHV).\n$$\nEF_{RFG} = \\frac{\\text{mass of } \\text{CO}_2 \\text{ produced}}{\\text{Energy released (LHV)}}\n$$\nWe will calculate this on the basis of one mole of the RFG mixture.\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator: the mass of $\\text{CO}_2$ produced per mole of RFG. This depends on the carbon content of the fuel, the stoichiometric conversion of carbon to $\\text{CO}_2$, and the oxidation fraction $\\alpha$.\n\nThe number of moles of carbon atoms, $n_C$, in one mole of the RFG mixture is the sum of the moles of carbon from each hydrocarbon component:\n$$\nn_C = x_{\\text{CH}_4} \\cdot (\\text{1 C per } \\text{CH}_4) + x_{\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_6} \\cdot (\\text{2 C per } \\text{C}_2\\text{H}_6) + x_{\\text{C}_3\\text{H}_8} \\cdot (\\text{3 C per } \\text{C}_3\\text{H}_8) + x_{\\text{H}_2} \\cdot (\\text{0 C per } \\text{H}_2)\n$$\nSubstituting the given mole fractions, $x_i$:\n$$\nn_C = (0.60 \\cdot 1) + (0.25 \\cdot 2) + (0.10 \\cdot 3) + (0.05 \\cdot 0) = 0.60 + 0.50 + 0.30 + 0 = 1.40~\\mathrm{mol~C~(mol~RFG)^{-1}}\n$$\nThe stoichiometric reaction for carbon oxidation is $C + O_2 \\to \\text{CO}_2$, so one mole of carbon produces one mole of $\\text{CO}_2$. Given the oxidation fraction $\\alpha = 0.99$, the moles of $\\text{CO}_2$ produced per mole of RFG combusted is:\n$$\nn_{\\text{CO}_2} = n_C \\cdot \\alpha = 1.40 \\cdot 0.99 = 1.386~\\mathrm{mol~\\text{CO}_2~(mol~RFG)^{-1}}\n$$\nThe molar mass of $\\text{CO}_2$, $M_{\\text{CO}_2}$, is calculated using the molar masses of carbon ($M_C = 12.011~\\mathrm{g~mol^{-1}}$) and oxygen ($M_O = 15.999~\\mathrm{g~mol^{-1}}$):\n$$\nM_{\\text{CO}_2} = M_C + 2 \\cdot M_O = 12.011 + 2 \\cdot 15.999 = 44.009~\\mathrm{g~mol^{-1}}\n$$\nThe mass of $\\text{CO}_2$ produced per mole of RFG, $m_{\\text{CO}_2}$, is:\n$$\nm_{\\text{CO}_2} = n_{\\text{CO}_2} \\cdot M_{\\text{CO}_2} = 1.386~\\mathrm{mol} \\cdot 44.009~\\mathrm{g~mol^{-1}} = 60.996534~\\mathrm{g}\n$$\nNext, calculate the denominator: the LHV of one mole of the RFG mixture. This is the mole-fraction-weighted average of the component molar LHVs:\n$$\nLHV_{RFG, molar} = \\sum_{i} x_i \\cdot LHV_i\n$$\n$$\nLHV_{RFG, molar} = (0.60 \\cdot 802) + (0.25 \\cdot 1428) + (0.10 \\cdot 2043) + (0.05 \\cdot 241.8)~\\mathrm{kJ~mol^{-1}}\n$$\n$$\nLHV_{RFG, molar} = 481.2 + 357.0 + 204.3 + 12.09 = 1054.59~\\mathrm{kJ~mol^{-1}}\n$$\nNow, the $EF_{RFG}$ can be computed. The units must be converted from $\\mathrm{g~kJ^{-1}}$ to $\\mathrm{kg~GJ^{-1}}$. The conversion factor is $1~\\mathrm{g~kJ^{-1}} = 1000~\\mathrm{kg~GJ^{-1}}$.\n$$\nEF_{RFG} = \\frac{m_{\\text{CO}_2}}{LHV_{RFG, molar}} = \\frac{60.996534~\\mathrm{g}}{1054.59~\\mathrm{kJ}} \\approx 0.05784065~\\mathrm{g~kJ^{-1}}\n$$\n$$\nEF_{RFG} = 0.05784065~\\mathrm{g~kJ^{-1}} \\cdot \\frac{10^6~\\mathrm{kJ}}{1~\\mathrm{GJ}} \\cdot \\frac{1~\\mathrm{kg}}{1000~\\mathrm{g}} = 57.84065~\\mathrm{kg~CO_2~GJ^{-1}}\n$$\nThis completes the first task.\n\n#### Task 2: Calculation of Total Annual $\\text{CO}_2$ Emissions\n\nTotal annual emissions, $E_{total}$, are the sum of direct emissions from the three fuels and indirect emissions from electricity. $E = Q \\cdot EF$, where $Q$ is the annual energy and $EF$ is the emission factor.\n\n1.  **Natural Gas (NG) Emissions ($E_{NG}$)**\n    The total energy from NG, $Q_{NG}$, is the volume burned multiplied by its volumetric LHV.\n    $$\n    Q_{NG} = V_{NG} \\cdot LHV_{NG, vol} = (1.80 \\times 10^{9}~\\mathrm{Nm^3}) \\cdot (35.8~\\mathrm{MJ~Nm^{-3}}) = 6.444 \\times 10^{10}~\\mathrm{MJ}\n    $$\n    Convert energy to Gigajoules (GJ), where $1~\\mathrm{GJ} = 1000~\\mathrm{MJ}$:\n    $$\n    Q_{NG} = 6.444 \\times 10^{10}~\\mathrm{MJ} \\cdot \\frac{1~\\mathrm{GJ}}{1000~\\mathrm{MJ}} = 6.444 \\times 10^7~\\mathrm{GJ}\n    $$\n    The emissions are:\n    $$\n    E_{NG} = Q_{NG} \\cdot EF_{NG} = (6.444 \\times 10^7~\\mathrm{GJ}) \\cdot (56.1~\\mathrm{kg~CO_2~GJ^{-1}}) = 3.615084 \\times 10^9~\\mathrm{kg~\\text{CO}_2}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Refinery Fuel Gas (RFG) Emissions ($E_{RFG}$)**\n    The annual energy input is given as $Q_{RFG} = 25{,}000~\\mathrm{TJ}$.

Assume linear cost and capacity constraints and no minimum load constraints.\n\nFormulate the primal Linear Programming (LP) problem with cost-minimization and steam balance, and derive its Lagrangian dual using the standard linear programming duality construction (define the dual variables associated with the steam balance and the capacity constraints). Based on first principles from duality and complementary slackness, determine the shadow price (dual variable) of the steam demand constraint and interpret it as the marginal cost of heat supply under the current configuration. Then select the correct option below.\n\nOptions:\nA.

The parameters (efficiencies, prices, capacities) are within realistic ranges.\n-   **Well-Posed:** It is a classic cost-minimization problem with linear constraints, which is well-posed and has a unique, stable solution.\n-   **Objective:** The language is precise, quantitative, and free of subjectivity.\n-   **Complete and Consistent:** All necessary data for solving the problem are provided. There are no apparent contradictions, although it is a common and reasonable assumption that the CHP unit uses natural gas, as the fuel is not specified.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Primal LP Problem and Determine the Optimal Dispatch\n\nThe objective is to minimize the total operating cost per hour. To do this, we first calculate the specific cost of steam production for each technology in units of $\\$/\\mathrm{MWh}_{\\text{th}}$.\n\nThe fuel price in $\\$/\\mathrm{MWh}$ is calculated from the price in $\\$/\\mathrm{MMBtu}$ using the given conversion factor:\nPrice in $\\$/\\mathrm{MWh} = \\text{Price in } \\$/\\mathrm{MMBtu} \\div \\frac{0.293071\\,\\mathrm{MWh}}{1\\,\\mathrm{MMBtu}}$.\n\nPrice of natural gas: $p_{NG} = \\frac{8\\,\\$}{0.293071\\,\\mathrm{MWh}} \\approx 27.3156\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MWh}$.\nPrice of biomass: $p_{Bio} = \\frac{5\\,\\$}{0.293071\\,\\mathrm{MWh}} \\approx 17.0723\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MWh}$.\n\nThe specific cost $c_i$ for each technology $i$ is the cost of fuel input per unit of steam output, minus any revenue.\n-   **Boiler A (Natural Gas):**\n    The cost is the fuel price divided by the boiler's thermal efficiency.\n    $$c_A = \\frac{p_{NG}}{\\eta_A} = \\frac{8\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MMBtu}}{0.293071\\,\\mathrm{MWh/MMBtu} \\times 0.90} \\approx 30.3301\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MWh_{th}}$$\n\n-   **Boiler B (Biomass):**\n    Similarly, the cost is the biomass price divided by the efficiency.\n    $$c_B = \\frac{p_{Bio}}{\\eta_B} = \\frac{5\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MMBtu}}{0.293071\\,\\mathrm{MWh/MMBtu} \\times 0.80} \\approx 21.3259\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MWh_{th}}$$\n\n-   **CHP C (assumed Natural Gas):**\n    The CHP unit has a fuel cost but also generates revenue from electricity sales. The net cost is the fuel cost per $\\mathrm{MWh}_{\\text{th}}$ of steam minus the electricity revenue per $\\mathrm{MWh}_{\\text{th}}$ of steam.\n    Fuel cost per $\\mathrm{MWh}_{\\text{th}}$: $\\frac{p_{NG}}{\\eta_C} = \\frac{8\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MMBtu}}{0.293071\\,\\mathrm{MWh/MMBtu} \\times 0.70} \\approx 39.0223\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MWh_{th}}$.\n    Revenue per $\\mathrm{MWh}_{\\text{th}}$: $0.4\\,\\mathrm{MWh_e/MWh_{th}} \\times 60\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MWh_e} = 24\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MWh_{th}}$.\n    $$c_C = \\frac{p_{NG}}{\\eta_C} - \\alpha \\times r_{Elec} = 39.0223 - 24 = 15.0223\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MWh_{th}}$$\n\n-   **Purchase P:**\n    The cost is given directly.\n    $$c_P = 40.00\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MWh_{th}}$$\n\n**Primal LP Formulation:**\n\nObjective function: Minimize total cost $Z$.\n$$ \\min Z = 30.33 x_A + 21.33 x_B + 15.02 x_C + 40.00 x_P $$\n\nSubject to constraints:\n1.  Steam Balance: $x_A + x_B + x_C + x_P = 120$\n2.  Capacity Constraints:\n    $0 \\le x_A \\le 80$\n    $0 \\le x_B \\le 60$\n    $0 \\le x_C \\le 40$\n    $x_P \\ge 0$\n\n**Optimal Dispatch (Merit Order):**\nTo minimize cost, we dispatch the technologies in increasing order of their specific costs (the \"merit order\") until the demand of $D = 120\\,\\mathrm{MW_{th}}$ is met.\n\nMerit Order:\n1.  CHP C ($c_C \\approx 15.02\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MWh_{th}}$)\n2.  Biomass Boiler B ($c_B \\approx 21.33\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MWh_{th}}$)\n3.  Natural Gas Boiler A ($c_A \\approx 30.33\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MWh_{th}}$)\n4.  Purchase P ($c_P = 40.00\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MWh_{th}}$)\n\nDispatch:\n1.  Dispatch CHP C up to its capacity: $x_C = 40\\,\\mathrm{MW_{th}}$. Remaining demand: $120 - 40 = 80\\,\\mathrm{MW_{th}}$.\n2.  Dispatch Boiler B up to its capacity: $x_B = 60\\,\\mathrm{MW_{th}}$. Remaining demand: $80 - 60 = 20\\,\\mathrm{MW_{th}}$.\n3.  Dispatch Boiler A to meet the rest of the demand: $x_A = 20\\,\\mathrm{MW_{th}}$. Remaining demand: $20 - 20 = 0\\,\\mathrm{MW_{th}}$.\n4.  Boiler A is only partially loaded ($20\\,\\mathrm{MW_{th}} < 80\\,\\mathrm{MW_{th}}$). Purchase P is not used: $x_P = 0\\,\\mathrm{MW_{th}}$.\n\nThe optimal solution is $x_A^* = 20$, $x_B^* = 60$, $x_C^* = 40$, $x_P^* = 0$.\n\n### Step 3: Duality and the Shadow Price\n\nThe shadow price of the steam demand constraint is the value of the dual variable associated with the steam balance equation, let's call it $\\lambda$. From duality theory and the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, for any technology $i$ that is operating strictly between its minimum and maximum capacity ($0 < x_i < K_i$), its marginal cost must be equal to the system's marginal price, $\\lambda$.\n$$ c_i = \\lambda $$\nFor any infra-marginal technology $j$ operating at full capacity ($x_j = K_j$), its cost is less than the system marginal price ($c_j < \\lambda$). For any supra-marginal technology $k$ that is not dispatched ($x_k = 0$), its cost is greater than or equal to the system marginal price ($c_k \\ge \\lambda$).\n\nIn our optimal solution, Natural Gas Boiler A is the only unit operating between its lower ($0$) and upper ($80\\,\\mathrm{MW_{th}}$) bounds. It is the \"marginal unit\". Therefore, it sets the system's marginal price. The shadow price of the steam demand is equal to the specific cost of Boiler A.\n$$ \\lambda = c_A \\approx 30.3301\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MWh_{th}} $$\nThis value, $\\lambda$, represents the cost to the system of supplying one additional $\\mathrm{MW}_{\\text{th}}$ of steam. This additional steam would be produced by Boiler A, as it is the cheapest available source with spare capacity.\n\n### Step 4: Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The shadow price equals $30.33\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MWh_{th}}$, representing the marginal cost set by the natural gas boiler $A$, which is partially utilized and has slack capacity, given that the biomass boiler $B$ and CHP $C$ are at their capacity limits.**\n-   The value $30.33\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MWh_{th}}$ is the correct value of $c_A$ rounded to two decimal places.\n-   The reasoning is entirely correct. Natural gas boiler A is the marginal unit, as it is partially utilized ($20/80\\,\\mathrm{MW_{th}}$) while the cheaper units B and C are at their capacity limits. Thus, $c_A$ sets the marginal cost, which is the shadow price.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The shadow price equals $14.99\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MWh_{th}}$, because marginal cost is always the lowest unit cost among available technologies, here set by CHP $C$.**\n-   The value is an approximation of $c_C$.\n-   The reasoning is incorrect. The marginal cost is set by the last (most expensive) unit dispatched, not the first (cheapest). CHP C is an infra-marginal unit.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The shadow price equals $21.31\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MWh_{th}}$, because the biomass boiler $B$ is fully utilized and therefore sets the marginal cost.**\n-   The value is an approximation of $c_B$.\n-   The reasoning is incorrect. A unit operating at full capacity cannot supply an additional unit of demand and therefore does not set the marginal price (unless the next unit has the same cost, which is not the case here). Boiler B is an infra-marginal unit.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The shadow price equals $40.00\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MWh_{th}}$, equal to the external steam purchase price, reflecting the cost of unmet demand.**\n-   The value is $c_P$.\n-   The reasoning is incorrect. External purchase P would only set the marginal price if all cheaper internal generation units (A, B, and C) were operating at their full capacity. Since total internal capacity ($180\\,\\mathrm{MW_{th}}$) exceeds demand ($120\\,\\mathrm{MW_{th}}$), P is not used.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The shadow price equals $20.72\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MWh_{th}}$, the average cost of the optimal steam supply mix, because marginal cost equals average cost in linear systems.**\n-   The value is a close approximation of the average cost of steam ($ \\approx 20.73\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MWh_{th}}$).\n-   The reasoning is incorrect. Marginal cost and average cost are not equal in a system with a tiered cost structure. The marginal cost ($30.33\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MWh_{th}}$) is significantly higher than the average cost ($20.73\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MWh_{th}}$).\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
