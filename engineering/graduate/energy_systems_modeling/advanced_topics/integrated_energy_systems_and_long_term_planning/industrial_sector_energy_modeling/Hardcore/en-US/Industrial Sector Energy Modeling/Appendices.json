            "problem": "An integrated chemical manufacturing site operates at steady state over a year and is to be modeled at the site boundary using the First Law of Thermodynamics for control volumes. The plant uses natural gas in onsite boilers to produce process steam, purchases electricity from the grid, purchases additional saturated steam from an external supplier, and sells a portion of its onsite steam to a neighboring facility. All energy quantities are to be accounted on a Higher Heating Value (HHV) basis for fuels and using enthalpy at the plant header for steam. The following annual boundary-crossing energy flows have been measured:\n- Natural gas fuel into onsite boilers: $4.00 \\times 10^{5}$ $\\mathrm{GJ/year}$.\n- Electricity purchased from the grid: $5.00 \\times 10^{4}$ $\\mathrm{GJ/year}$.\n- Saturated steam purchased from an external supplier (as delivered to the site header): $1.00 \\times 10^{5}$ $\\mathrm{GJ/year}$.\n- Saturated steam sold to a neighboring site (as exported from the site header): $2.00 \\times 10^{4}$ $\\mathrm{GJ/year}$.\n\nA novice analyst, attempting to be comprehensive, proposes to add the external supplier’s fuel used to generate the purchased steam as an additional site input.

Derive from first principles an expression for the site’s net annual energy consumption based on boundary-crossing energy carriers, and then evaluate it numerically using the measured data above.\n\nRound your final numerical answer to four significant figures. Express the final energy in $\\mathrm{GJ/year}$.",
            "solution": "The appropriate fundamental base is the First Law of Thermodynamics (energy conservation) applied to a control volume representing the industrial site. At annual steady state, the rate form integrated over the year implies that the net energy flow into the control volume equals the net energy flow out of the control volume plus any change in internal energy over the year. Under steady-state assumptions, the change in internal energy over the year is zero. Neglecting kinetic and potential energy changes and using Higher Heating Value (HHV) for fuels and enthalpy at the header for steam, the boundary-crossing energy accounting must include only energy carriers that physically cross the site boundary.\n\nLet the measured annual energy flows crossing the boundary be defined as follows:\n- Fuel energy input to the site boundary (natural gas to onsite boilers): $E_{\\mathrm{fuel}} = 4.00 \\times 10^{5}$.\n- Electricity purchased: $E_{\\mathrm{elec}} = 5.00 \\times 10^{4}$.\n- Steam purchased: $E_{\\mathrm{steam,pur}} = 1.00 \\times 10^{5}$.\n- Steam sold: $E_{\\mathrm{steam,sold}} = 2.00 \\times 10^{4}$.\nAll quantities are in $\\mathrm{GJ/year}$.\n\nPart 1: Demonstration of violation by double-counting external fuel for purchased steam.\n\nThe novice proposes adding the external supplier’s fuel used to produce the purchased steam to the site’s energy input. Let the external fuel associated with purchased steam be expressed using the supplier’s boiler efficiency $\\eta_{\\mathrm{ext}}$:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{upstream}} = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{steam,pur}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{ext}}}.\n$$\nHere, $E_{\\mathrm{steam,pur}}$ is the useful steam enthalpy delivered to the site header; $\\eta_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ relates the external supplier’s fuel input to the delivered steam energy. Numerically,\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{upstream}} = \\frac{1.00 \\times 10^{5}}{0.85} = 1.176470588 \\times 10^{5} \\ \\mathrm{GJ/year}.\n$$\nIf one incorrectly includes $E_{\\mathrm{upstream}}$ as an additional input to the site, the proposed net input would be\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{wrong}} = E_{\\mathrm{fuel}} + E_{\\mathrm{elec}} + E_{\\mathrm{steam,pur}} + E_{\\mathrm{upstream}} - E_{\\mathrm{steam,sold}}.\n$$\nBy contrast, the physically measured energy flows crossing the boundary (inputs and outputs) are\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{in,meas}} = E_{\\mathrm{fuel}} + E_{\\mathrm{elec}} + E_{\\mathrm{steam,pur}}, \\quad E_{\\mathrm{out,meas}} = E_{\\mathrm{steam,sold}} + \\text{other measured outputs}.\n$$\nAt steady state, the First Law demands that the sum of boundary-crossing inputs minus outputs equals zero after accounting for internal energy changes (assumed zero). The quantity $E_{\\mathrm{upstream}}$ does not cross the site boundary; it is an upstream energy consumption occurring outside the control volume. Therefore, adding $E_{\\mathrm{upstream}}$ creates an artificial imbalance equal to $E_{\\mathrm{upstream}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{imbalance}} = E_{\\mathrm{wrong}} - \\left(E_{\\mathrm{fuel}} + E_{\\mathrm{elec}} + E_{\\mathrm{steam,pur}} - E_{\\mathrm{steam,sold}}\\right) = E_{\\mathrm{upstream}}.\n$$\nNumerically,\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{imbalance}} = 1.176470588 \\times 10^{5} \\ \\mathrm{GJ/year}.\n$$\nThis nonzero imbalance arises solely from counting an energy quantity that does not cross the site boundary, thus violating the steady-state energy balance for the site control volume.\n\nPart 2: Derivation of the corrected net site energy expression and evaluation.\n\nFrom the First Law for a steady-state control volume, the site’s net annual energy consumption must be expressed in terms of energy carriers that physically cross the boundary. Energy carriers imported to the site increase net consumption; energy carriers exported decrease it. Therefore, the net annual site energy consumption is\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{net}} = E_{\\mathrm{fuel}} + E_{\\mathrm{elec}} + E_{\\mathrm{steam,pur}} - E_{\\mathrm{steam,sold}}.\n$$\nSubstituting the measured values:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{net}} = \\left(4.00 \\times 10^{5}\\right) + \\left(5.00 \\times 10^{4}\\right) + \\left(1.00 \\times 10^{5}\\right) - \\left(2.00 \\times 10^{4}\\right).\n$$\nCompute stepwise:\n$$\n4.00 \\times 10^{5} + 5.00 \\times 10^{4} = 4.50 \\times 10^{5},\n$$\n$$\n4.50 \\times 10^{5} + 1.00 \\times 10^{5} = 5.50 \\times 10^{5},\n$$\n$$\n5.50 \\times 10^{5} - 2.00 \\times 10^{4} = 5.30 \\times 10^{5}.\n$$\nThus,\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{net}} = 5.30 \\times 10^{5} \\ \\mathrm{GJ/year}.\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures in standard scientific notation,\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{net}} \\approx 5.300 \\times 10^{5} \\ \\mathrm{GJ/year}.\n$$\nThis corrected value adheres to the First Law at the site boundary by counting only energy flows that cross the boundary and avoids double-counting upstream energy that belongs to the external supplier’s boundary.",

We assume the CHP uses natural gas.\n    - Fuel Cost: $\\frac{p_{NG}}{\\eta_C} = \\frac{27.3156\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MWh}}{0.70} \\approx 39.0223\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MWh_{th}}$.\n    - Electricity Revenue: $0.4\\,\\mathrm{MWh_e/MWh_{th}} \\times 60\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MWh_e} = 24\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MWh_{th}}$.\n    - Net Cost: $$c_C = 39.0223 - 24 = 15.0223\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MWh_{th}}$$\n\n-   **Purchase P:** The cost is given directly.\n    $$c_P = 40.00\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MWh_{th}}$$\n\nThe primal LP problem is:\n$$ \\min_{x_A, x_B, x_C, x_P} Z = 30.35 x_A + 21.34 x_B + 15.02 x_C + 40.00 x_P $$\nSubject to:\n1.  Steam Balance: $x_A + x_B + x_C + x_P = 120$  ($\\lambda$)\n2.  Capacity Constraints:\n    $0 \\le x_A \\le 80$  ($\\mu_{A,min}, \\mu_{A,max}$)\n    $0 \\le x_B \\le 60$  ($\\mu_{B,min}, \\mu_{B,max}$)\n    $0 \\le x_C \\le 40$  ($\\mu_{C,min}, \\mu_{C,max}$)\n    $x_P \\ge 0$  ($\\mu_{P,min}$)\nThe symbols in parentheses are the dual variables (shadow prices) for each constraint.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Optimal Dispatch (Merit Order)**\n\nTo minimize cost, technologies are dispatched in increasing order of their specific costs (the merit order) until the demand ($D = 120\\,\\mathrm{MW_{th}}$) is met.\n\nMerit Order:\n1.  CHP C ($c_C \\approx 15.02\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MWh_{th}}$)\n2.  Biomass Boiler B ($c_B \\approx 21.34\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MWh_{th}}$)\n3.  Natural Gas Boiler A ($c_A \\approx 30.35\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MWh_{th}}$)\n4.  Purchase P ($c_P = 40.00\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MWh_{th}}$)\n\nDispatch sequence:\n1.  Dispatch CHP C at its full capacity: $x_C = 40\\,\\mathrm{MW_{th}}$. Remaining demand: $120 - 40 = 80\\,\\mathrm{MW_{th}}$.\n2.  Dispatch Boiler B at its full capacity: $x_B = 60\\,\\mathrm{MW_{th}}$. Remaining demand: $80 - 60 = 20\\,\\mathrm{MW_{th}}$.\n3.  Dispatch Boiler A to meet the remaining demand: $x_A = 20\\,\\mathrm{MW_{th}}$. Remaining demand: $20 - 20 = 0$.\n4.  Boiler A is partially loaded ($20\\,\\mathrm{MW_{th}}  80\\,\\mathrm{MW_{th}}$), so Purchase P is not used: $x_P = 0\\,\\mathrm{MW_{th}}$.\n\nThe optimal dispatch is: $x_A^* = 20$, $x_B^* = 60$, $x_C^* = 40$, $x_P^* = 0$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Shadow Price of the Steam Demand Constraint**\n\nThe shadow price of the steam demand constraint, $\\lambda$, represents the marginal cost of supplying one additional unit ($\\mathrm{MWh_{th}}$) of steam. In a cost-minimizing system, this price is set by the specific cost of the **marginal unit**—the last technology dispatched that still has spare capacity.\n\nIn our optimal solution, CHP C and Boiler B are infra-marginal units operating at their capacity limits ($c_C  \\lambda$ and $c_B  \\lambda$). Boiler A is the marginal unit because it is dispatched but not at its full capacity ($0  x_A  K_A$). Any additional steam demand would be met by increasing the output of Boiler A.\n\nTherefore, the shadow price of the steam demand constraint is equal to the specific cost of Boiler A.\n$$ \\lambda = c_A \\approx 30.3507\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MWh_{th}} $$\nThe values in the options are rounded. The value $30.33\\,\\$/\\mathrm{MWh_{th}}$ in option A is a close approximation of our calculated cost for Boiler A. The reasoning provided in option A is entirely correct: the NG boiler A is the partially utilized marginal unit, and it sets the price after the cheaper biomass boiler B and CHP C have been fully dispatched. The other options are incorrect based on fundamental principles of economic dispatch.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct choice.",
