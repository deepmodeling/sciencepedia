            "problem": "Consider a single straight supply pipe segment in a District Cooling Network (DCN) conveying chilled water under steady, incompressible, fully developed flow. The pipe of length $L$ and internal diameter $D$ connects a central plant to a building substation. Assume negligible minor losses, negligible elevation change, constant fluid properties (density $\\rho$ and dynamic viscosity $\\mu$), and that the flow regime in the pipe is laminar. The branch requires a specified mass flow rate $\\dot{m}$ to meet the building’s cooling demand. Starting from the mechanical energy balance for internal flow and appropriate constitutive relations for viscous dissipation, apply the continuity relation $\\dot{m} = \\rho A v$ to eliminate the mean velocity $v$ in favor of $\\dot{m}$ and $D$, and derive an analytic expression for the frictional pressure drop $\\Delta p$ across the pipe as a function of $\\dot{m}$ and $D$. Then, deduce how $\\Delta p$ scales with $D$ for fixed $\\dot{m}$. Express the final analytic expression for $\\Delta p$ in Pascals.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an analytic expression for the frictional pressure drop, $\\Delta p$, in a straight pipe segment under specific conditions, and to determine its scaling with the pipe diameter, $D$. The derivation will begin from the general mechanical energy balance and incorporate the given constraints and physical laws.\n\nThe steady-state mechanical energy balance for an incompressible fluid flowing between two points, $1$ and $2$, along a streamline is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{p_1}{\\rho g} + \\alpha_1 \\frac{v_1^2}{2g} + z_1 + h_{pump,u} = \\frac{p_2}{\\rho g} + \\alpha_2 \\frac{v_2^2}{2g} + z_2 + h_{turbine,e} + h_L\n$$\nwhere $p$ is the pressure, $\\rho$ is the fluid density, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $v$ is the mean fluid velocity, $\\alpha$ is the kinetic energy correction factor, $z$ is the elevation, $h_{pump,u}$ is the useful head added by a pump, $h_{turbine,e}$ is the head extracted by a turbine, and $h_L$ is the total head loss due to viscous effects.\n\nWe apply the conditions specified in the problem statement:\n$1$. The pipe has a constant internal diameter $D$. From the principle of mass conservation for incompressible flow ($A_1 v_1 = A_2 v_2$), this implies the mean velocity is constant, $v_1 = v_2 = v$.\n$2$. The flow is fully developed, which means the velocity profile is unchanged along the pipe length. Consequently, the kinetic energy correction factors are equal, $\\alpha_1 = \\alpha_2$.\n$3$. There are no pumps or turbines within the pipe segment, so $h_{pump,u} = 0$ and $h_{turbine,e} = 0$.\n$4$. The elevation change is negligible, so $z_1 = z_2$.\n\nSubstituting these conditions into the energy balance equation simplifies it considerably:\n$$\n\\frac{p_1}{\\rho g} = \\frac{p_2}{\\rho g} + h_L\n$$\nRearranging for the pressure drop, $\\Delta p = p_1 - p_2$, we find:\n$$\n\\Delta p = p_1 - p_2 = \\rho g h_L\n$$\nThe problem states that minor losses are negligible, so the total head loss $h_L$ is solely due to major losses from friction along the pipe wall, denoted as $h_f$.\n$$\nh_L = h_f = f \\frac{L}{D} \\frac{v^2}{2g}\n$$\nHere, $f$ is the Darcy friction factor, $L$ is the pipe length, and $D$ is the pipe diameter. Substituting this expression for $h_L$ into the equation for $\\Delta p$ yields the Darcy-Weisbach equation for pressure drop:\n$$\n\\Delta p = \\rho g \\left( f \\frac{L}{D} \\frac{v^2}{2g} \\right) = f \\frac{L}{D} \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the flow regime is laminar. For laminar flow in a circular pipe (typically for Reynolds numbers $Re < 2300$), the Darcy friction factor $f$ is related to the Reynolds number $Re$ by the exact theoretical relation:\n$$\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n$$\nThe Reynolds number is a dimensionless quantity defined as:\n$$\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n$$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.\n\nWe substitute the expression for $f$ into the pressure drop equation:\n$$\n\\Delta p = \\left( \\frac{64}{Re} \\right) \\frac{L}{D} \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = \\frac{32 L \\rho v^2}{D \\cdot Re}\n$$\nNow, substituting the definition of $Re$:\n$$\n\\Delta p = \\frac{32 L \\rho v^2}{D \\left( \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \\right)} = \\frac{32 L \\rho v^2 \\mu}{D \\rho v D}\n$$\nSimplifying this expression by canceling terms ($\\rho$ and one factor of $v$) gives the Hagen-Poiseuille equation for pressure drop as a function of mean velocity:\n$$\n\\Delta p = \\frac{32 \\mu L v}{D^2}\n$$\nThe problem requires this expression to be in terms of the mass flow rate $\\dot{m}$ and diameter $D$, not the mean velocity $v$. We use the specified continuity relation $\\dot{m} = \\rho A v$, where $A$ is the pipe's cross-sectional area. For a circular pipe of diameter $D$, the area is $A = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}$.\n\nWe solve for the mean velocity $v$ in terms of $\\dot{m}$:\n$$\nv = \\frac{\\dot{m}}{\\rho A} = \\frac{\\dot{m}}{\\rho \\left( \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4} \\right)} = \\frac{4 \\dot{m}}{\\pi \\rho D^2}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $v$ into the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:\n$$\n\\Delta p = \\frac{32 \\mu L}{D^2} \\left( \\frac{4 \\dot{m}}{\\pi \\rho D^2} \\right)\n$$\nCombining the terms yields the final analytical expression for the frictional pressure drop:\n$$\n\\Delta p = \\frac{128 \\mu L \\dot{m}}{\\pi \\rho D^4}\n$$\nThis expression gives the pressure drop in units of Pascals, provided all input parameters are in consistent SI units.\n\nThe second part of the task is to deduce the scaling of $\\Delta p$ with $D$ for a fixed mass flow rate $\\dot{m}$. Examining the derived expression, we can group the constant parameters ($\\mu, L, \\dot{m}, \\rho, \\pi$) together.\n$$\n\\Delta p = \\left( \\frac{128 \\mu L \\dot{m}}{\\pi \\rho} \\right) \\frac{1}{D^4}\n$$\nFor a fixed mass flow rate and constant fluid and geometric properties (other than $D$), the pressure drop is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the pipe's internal diameter. This relationship is expressed as:\n$$\n\\Delta p \\propto \\frac{1}{D^4} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\Delta p \\propto D^{-4}\n$$\nThis strong dependence on diameter is a critical consideration in the design of piping networks, where a small increase in pipe diameter can lead to a significant reduction in the pressure drop and, consequently, the required pumping power.",

We define a control volume around this junction. The following mass flow rates are considered:\n-   $\\dot{m}_{p}$: The constant mass flow rate supplied by the primary pumps into the supply header.\n-   $\\dot{m}_{s}$: The variable mass flow rate drawn by the secondary pumps to serve the cooling load.\n-   $\\dot{m}_{d}$: The mass flow rate through the decoupler pipe.

The excess primary flow, $\\dot{m}_{d}$, bypasses the secondary circuit and flows through the decoupler to the primary return header.\n\nFlow reversal in the decoupler occurs when the secondary demand exceeds the primary supply, i.e., $\\dot{m}_{s} > \\dot{m}_{p}$. In this situation, the decoupler flow $\\dot{m}_{d}$ becomes negative, signifying that flow is now directed from the primary return header towards the primary supply header to make up the shortfall.\n\nThe *onset* of flow reversal is the critical point where the direction of flow is about to change. This corresponds to the condition where the decoupler flow is exactly zero.\n$$\n\\dot{m}_{d} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting this into the mass balance equation gives the condition for the onset of flow reversal:\n$$\n\\dot{m}_{p} - \\dot{m}_{s} = 0 \\implies \\dot{m}_{s} = \\dot{m}_{p}\n$$\nThus, flow reversal begins when the secondary mass flow rate exactly equals the primary mass flow rate.\n\n**Derivation of Critical Load for Flow Reversal**\n\nThe aggregated building cooling load, $L$, is the rate at which heat is transferred to the chilled water in the secondary circuit. This is given by the thermodynamic relation:\n$$\nL = \\dot{m}_{s} c_{p} \\Delta T_{s,load}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta T_{s,load}$ is the temperature rise of the water across the building loads. The problem states that the secondary network is designed to operate at an approximately constant secondary temperature rise, $\\Delta T_{s}$. So, we have:\n$$\nL = \\dot{m}_{s} c_{p} \\Delta T_{s}\n$$\nThe critical total secondary load, $L_{\\mathrm{rev}}$, is the load at which flow reversal first occurs. We found this condition to be $\\dot{m}_{s} = \\dot{m}_{p}$. Substituting this into the load equation yields the expression for the critical load:\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{rev}} = \\dot{m}_{p} c_{p} \\Delta T_{s}\n$$\n\n**Discussion of Implications**\n\nThe direction of flow in the decoupler has a critical impact on the temperature of the water supplied to the secondary network, $T_{s,s}$. Let $T_{p,s}$ be the primary supply temperature from the plant and $T_{p,r}$ be the primary return temperature. In a cooling system, $T_{p,r} > T_{p,s}$.\n\n1.  **No Reversal ($\\dot{m}_{d} \\ge 0$)**: When $\\dot{m}_{p} \\ge \\dot{m}_{s}$, the water supplied to the secondary circuit comes directly from the primary supply header. Therefore, the secondary supply temperature is equal to the primary supply temperature: $T_{s,s} = T_{p,s}$. This is the desired mode of operation, as it delivers the coldest possible water to the buildings.\n\n2.  **Flow Reversal ($\\dot{m}_{d} < 0$)**: When $\\dot{m}_{s} > \\dot{m}_{p}$, the primary flow is insufficient. The deficit, $|\\dot{m}_{d}| = \\dot{m}_{s} - \\dot{m}_{p}$, is drawn from the primary return header through the decoupler. This warmer return water (at temperature $T_{p,r}$) mixes with the primary supply water (at temperature $T_{p,s}$) at the supply header junction. An energy balance on the junction shows that the resulting secondary supply temperature $T_{s,s}$ becomes a weighted average of $T_{p,s}$ and $T_{p,r}$:\n    $$\n    T_{s,s} = \\frac{\\dot{m}_{p}T_{p,s} + (\\dot{m}_{s}-\\dot{m}_{p})T_{p,r}}{\\dot{m}_{s}}\n    $$\n    Since $T_{p,r} > T_{p,s}$, the consequence is that $T_{s,s} > T_{p,s}$. This phenomenon, known as supply temperature degradation, reduces the cooling potential of the water supplied to the buildings and can lead to an inability to meet the required cooling loads.\n\n**Implications for Sensor Placement and Control:**\n-   **Detection**: Reliable detection of flow reversal is crucial for plant operation. This can be achieved in several ways:\n    a) By placing flow meters to measure $\\dot{m}_{p}$ and $\\dot{m}_{s}$ and having the control system continuously compare them.\n    b) By installing a bidirectional flow meter directly in the decoupler pipe to measure $\\dot{m}_{d}$.\n    c) By placing temperature sensors to measure $T_{p,s}$ (just upstream of the decoupler) and $T_{s,s}$ (just downstream of the decoupler). A positive temperature difference, $T_{s,s} - T_{p,s} > 0$, is a definitive indicator of flow reversal.\n-   **Control Logic**: The plant's control system should actively prevent this condition by ensuring $\\dot{m}_{p}$ is always greater than or equal to $\\dot{m}_{s}$. As the secondary load $L$ (and thus $\\dot{m}_{s}$) increases and approaches the critical point ($\\dot{m}_{s} \\to \\dot{m}_{p}$), the control system must take action, typically by increasing the primary flow rate (e.g., by staging on additional primary pumps). The value $L_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ represents the maximum load the system can handle in its current primary operating mode without performance degradation.\n\n**Numerical Calculation of Critical Load**\n\nUsing the derived formula and the given parameter values:\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{rev}} = \\dot{m}_{p} c_{p} \\Delta T_{s}\n$$\nThe parameters are:\n-   $\\dot{m}_{p} = 280\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,s^{-1}}$\n-   $c_{p} = 4180\\,\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n-   $\\Delta T_{s} = 6\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n\nSubstituting these values:\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{rev}} = (280) \\times (4180) \\times (6)\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s^{-1}}\n$$\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{rev}} = 7,022,400\\,\\mathrm{W}\n$$\nTo express this in megawatts (MW), we divide by $10^6$:\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{rev}} = \\frac{7,022,400}{1,000,000}\\,\\mathrm{MW} = 7.0224\\,\\mathrm{MW}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{rev}} \\approx 7.022\\,\\mathrm{MW}\n$$",
