            "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and well-posed. The given parameters are the Mean Time Between Failures ($MTBF = 2000\\,\\mathrm{h}$), Mean Time To Repair ($MTTR = 50\\,\\mathrm{h}$), total up-time ($T_{\\text{up}} = 18{,}900\\,\\mathrm{h}$), and total down-time ($T_{\\text{down}} = 1{,}100\\,\\mathrm{h}$) over a horizon of $20{,}000\\,\\mathrm{h}$. The sum $T_{\\text{up}} + T_{\\text{down}} = 18{,}900\\,\\mathrm{h} + 1{,}100\\,\\mathrm{h} = 20{,}000\\,\\mathrm{h}$ is consistent with the stated total time horizon. The concepts of availability, MTBF, and MTTR are fundamental in reliability engineering. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe task is to compute the absolute difference between two distinct measures of availability: the theoretical steady-state availability derived from the renewal process parameters ($MTBF$ and $MTTR$), and the empirical availability measured from time-series data ($T_{\\text{up}}$ and $T_{\\text{down}}$).\n\nFirst, we derive the steady-state availability, denoted as $A_{\\text{ss}}$. For a system alternating between an operational state and a repair state, the steady-state availability is the long-run probability that the system is in the operational state. This is given by the ratio of the mean duration of the operational state ($MTBF$) to the mean duration of a full cycle (operational + repair).\nThe mean cycle time is $MTBF + MTTR$.\nThe formula for steady-state availability is:\n$$A_{\\text{ss}} = \\frac{MTBF}{MTBF + MTTR}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$A_{\\text{ss}} = \\frac{2000}{2000 + 50} = \\frac{2000}{2050} = \\frac{40}{41}$$\n\nNext, we derive the empirical availability, denoted as $A_{\\text{emp}}$. This is calculated from the aggregated time-series data over a finite observation period. It is the ratio of the total time the unit was operational ($T_{\\text{up}}$) to the total observation period ($T_{\\text{total}}$).\nThe total observation period is the sum of the up-time and the down-time:\n$$T_{\\text{total}} = T_{\\text{up}} + T_{\\text{down}} = 18{,}900\\,\\mathrm{h} + 1{,}100\\,\\mathrm{h} = 20{,}000\\,\\mathrm{h}$$\nThe formula for empirical availability is:\n$$A_{\\text{emp}} = \\frac{T_{\\text{up}}}{T_{\\text{total}}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$A_{\\text{emp}} = \\frac{18{,}900}{20{,}000} = \\frac{189}{200}$$\n\nThe problem requires the absolute difference, $\\Delta A$, between these two availability metrics.\n$$\\Delta A = |A_{\\text{ss}} - A_{\\text{emp}}|$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for $A_{\\text{ss}}$ and $A_{\\text{emp}}$:\n$$\\Delta A = \\left| \\frac{40}{41} - \\frac{189}{200} \\right|$$\nTo subtract the fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $41 \\times 200 = 8200$.\n$$\\Delta A = \\left| \\frac{40 \\times 200}{41 \\times 200} - \\frac{189 \\times 41}{200 \\times 41} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{8000}{8200} - \\frac{7749}{8200} \\right|$$\nPerforming the subtraction in the numerator:\n$$\\Delta A = \\left| \\frac{8000 - 7749}{8200} \\right| = \\frac{251}{8200}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $\\Delta A$ and round it to four significant figures as requested.\n$$\\Delta A = \\frac{251}{8200} \\approx 0.030609756...$$\nTo round to four significant figures, we look at the digits starting from the first non-zero digit. The first significant figure is $3$. The subsequent three figures are $0$, $6$, and $0$. The fifth significant figure is $9$.

You will calculate and compare the time-based Forced Outage Rate ($FOR$) with the demand-weighted Equivalent Forced Outage Rate ($EFORd$), using a detailed event history for a generating unit. This problem demonstrates a critical principle in systems modeling: the choice of metric matters, as it frames reliability in terms of either intrinsic equipment performance or the actual impact on service delivery .",

            "problem": "An electric power system operator is modeling the reliability performance of a single thermal generating unit during a shoulder-season month characterized by lower net load and a planned maintenance outage. The operator wishes to quantify two reliability metrics from first principles using the unit’s hourly event history: the demand-weighted equivalent forced outage rate (EFORd) and the time-based forced outage rate (FOR). The operator will then compare these metrics to understand how shoulder-season maintenance and low net load affect the perception of unit reliability.\n\nUse the following foundational base and event data:\n\nFoundational base:\n- A generating unit’s availability is represented by an indicator function $A(t)$ that equals $1$ when the unit is not in planned maintenance and not in forced outage, and equals $0$ otherwise. The operator records planned maintenance via an indicator $M(t)$ and forced outages via an indicator $F(t)$, with mutually exclusive states such that for any hour $t$, exactly one of $M(t)$, $F(t)$, or $A(t)$ is $1$. Define the unit’s requirement (call to serve) as a binary indicator $C(t)$ that equals $1$ if the system would dispatch the unit at hour $t$ if it were available, and $0$ otherwise. The operator models EFORd conceptually as the fraction of time a called unit cannot deliver due to forced outage, and models FOR conceptually as the fraction of time the unit is in forced outage during hours not covered by planned maintenance.\n- You will treat the month as a discrete-time horizon of $H$ hours, and compute both metrics by aggregating the recorded hourly event history.\n\nEvent history for the shoulder-season month:\n- Total horizon: $H = 672$ hours.\n- Planned maintenance hours: $H_{P} = 336$ consecutive hours, from hour $t=0$ through hour $t=335$, so $M(t) = 1$ over these hours.\n- Non-maintenance hours: $H_{\\text{NM}} = 336$ hours, from hour $t=336$ through hour $t=671$.\n- Requirement (call) during non-maintenance: The unit would be called for $H_{R} = 192$ hours; it would not be called for $336 - 192 = 144$ hours. That is, over non-maintenance hours, $C(t) = 1$ for $192$ hours and $C(t) = 0$ for $144$ hours.\n- Forced outage events during non-maintenance:\n  1. Event $F_{1}$: $14$ consecutive hours of forced outage beginning at hour $t=336$ and ending at hour $t=349$ inclusive, with $10$ of those hours coinciding with $C(t) = 1$.\n  2. Event $F_{2}$: $7$ consecutive hours of forced outage later in the month, with all $7$ hours coinciding with $C(t) = 1$.\n  3. Event $F_{3}$: $5$ consecutive hours of forced outage overnight, with all $5$ hours coinciding with $C(t) = 0$.\n- There are no other forced outages. There are no partial forced outages; whenever $F(t) = 1$ the unit’s available capacity is reduced to zero.\n\nTasks:\n1. Starting from the definitions above, express demand-weighted equivalent forced outage rate (EFORd) as an appropriate aggregation over hours that uses only forced outage hours when the unit is called, and derive its value from the given event history.\n2. Express time-based forced outage rate (FOR) as an appropriate aggregation over hours that uses all forced outage hours outside planned maintenance, and derive its value from the given event history.\n3. Provide the two computed rates as dimensionless decimals, and round each to four significant figures. Do not use a percentage sign.\n\nExpress your final output as the ordered pair $\\left(\\text{EFORd}, \\text{FOR}\\right)$.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of two distinct reliability metrics, the demand-weighted equivalent forced outage rate (EFORd) and the time-based forced outage rate (FOR), based on a discrete-time event history over a total horizon of $H=672$ hours.\n\nFirst, we formalize the definitions and aggregate the provided event data. Let the discrete time index be $t \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, H-1\\}$. The state of the generating unit is described by the mutually exclusive indicator functions $A(t)$, $M(t)$, and $F(t)$, such that $A(t) + M(t) + F(t) = 1$ for all $t$.\n\nThe total number of hours in planned maintenance is given as $H_P = 336$. In our summation notation, $H_P = \\sum_{t=0}^{H-1} M(t) = 336$.\n\nThe period not under planned maintenance, which we will call the service period, comprises $H_{\\text{NM}}$ hours:\n$$H_{\\text{NM}} = H - H_P = 672 - 336 = 336 \\text{ hours}$$\nDuring this service period, the unit is either available ($A(t)=1$) or on a forced outage ($F(t)=1$). Thus, for any $t$ where $M(t)=0$, we have $A(t) + F(t) = 1$. The duration of this period can be expressed as $\\sum_{t=0}^{H-1} (1-M(t))$.\n\nNext, we aggregate the forced outage hours. All forced outages occur during the non-maintenance period.\n- Total hours for event $F_1$: $14$ hours.\n- Total hours for event $F_2$: $7$ hours.\n- Total hours for event $F_3$: $5$ hours.\n\nThe total forced outage hours, $H_{FO}$, is the sum of the durations of these events:\n$$H_{FO} = 14 + 7 + 5 = 26 \\text{ hours}$$\nSymbolically, $H_{FO} = \\sum_{t=0}^{H-1} F(t)$.\n\nFor EFORd, we need to consider when the unit was called to serve, indicated by $C(t)=1$. The total number of hours the unit was called, $H_R$, is given as $192$:\n$$H_R = \\sum_{t=0}^{H-1} C(t) = 192 \\text{ hours}$$\nWe must also find the number of forced outage hours that occurred when the unit was called. Let this be $H_{FOC}$ (Forced Outage hours while Called).\n- From event $F_1$: $10$ hours with $C(t)=1$.\n- From event $F_2$: $7$ hours with $C(t)=1$.\n- From event $F_3$: $0$ hours with $C(t)=1$.\n\nSumming these gives:\n$$H_{FOC} = 10 + 7 + 0 = 17 \\text{ hours}$$\nSymbolically, $H_{FOC} = \\sum_{t=0}^{H-1} F(t)C(t)$.\n\n**1. Calculation of EFORd**\nThe problem defines EFORd as the \"fraction of time a called unit cannot deliver due to forced outage.\" This is a conditional probability: the probability of the unit being in a forced outage state, given that it was called. This translates to the ratio of the total forced outage hours when called, to the total hours the unit was called.\n\n$$ \\text{EFORd} = \\frac{\\text{Forced Outage Hours while Called}}{\\text{Total Called Hours}} = \\frac{H_{FOC}}{H_R} $$\nUsing the aggregated values:\n$$ \\text{EFORd} = \\frac{17}{192} $$\nAs a decimal, this is $17 \\div 192 \\approx 0.08854166\\ldots$. Rounded to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ \\text{EFORd} \\approx 0.08854 $$\n\n**2. Calculation of FOR**\nThe problem defines FOR as the \"fraction of time the unit is in forced outage during hours not covered by planned maintenance.\" This is the ratio of the total forced outage hours to the total duration of the service period (i.e., non-maintenance hours).\n\n$$ \\text{FOR} = \\frac{\\text{Total Forced Outage Hours}}{\\text{Non-Maintenance Hours}} = \\frac{H_{FO}}{H_{\\text{NM}}} $$\nUsing the aggregated values:\n$$ \\text{FOR} = \\frac{26}{336} $$\nThis fraction can be simplified by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, $2$:\n$$ \\text{FOR} = \\frac{13}{168} $$\nAs a decimal, this is $13 \\div 168 \\approx 0.07738095\\ldots$. Rounded to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ \\text{FOR} \\approx 0.07738 $$\n\nThe two computed rates are $\\text{EFORd} \\approx 0.08854$ and $\\text{FOR} \\approx 0.07738$. The EFORd is higher than the FOR, which is an expected outcome for this shoulder-season scenario. The FOR metric is penalized by all forced outage hours during the service period ($26$ hours), including those when the unit was not needed (e.g., the $5$ hours of event $F_3$). In contrast, EFORd focuses only on failures during demand periods. Its denominator is smaller ($192$ vs. $336$), and it excludes failures that have no immediate system impact, making it a more accurate measure of reliability from the perspective of meeting demand. The fact that a significant portion of forced outage hours ($17$ out of $26$) occurred during demand periods, while a large portion of the service period was off-peak ($144$ hours), leads to an EFORd value greater than the FOR.\n\nThe final result is the ordered pair $(\\text{EFORd}, \\text{FOR})$.",

The annual capacity factor (CF) is defined from first principles as the ratio of the actual energy generated to the maximum possible energy at rated capacity, namely\n$$\n\\mathrm{CF} \\equiv \\frac{1}{C_{r} T} \\int_{0}^{T} P(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t,\n$$\nwhere $T$ is the total duration of the year in hours and $P(t)$ is the realized electrical output. The plant experiences both planned outages and forced outages. A planned outage is operator-scheduled and sets availability to zero during the specified hours. A forced outage is stochastic and modeled as a constant fraction of time the plant is unexpectedly unavailable. The expected availability during non-planned-outage hours is $1$ minus the forced outage rate (FOR).\n\nAssume a non-leap-year calendar with the following hours per month: January $744$, February $672$, March $744$, April $720$, May $744$, June $720$, July $744$, August $744$, September $720$, October $744$, November $720$, December $744$, so that $T = 8760$. The system exhibits seasonality as follows:\n- Winter season: December, January, February with total hours $2160$.\n- Summer season: June, July, August with total hours $2208$.\n- Shoulder season: March, April, May, September, October, November with total hours $4392$.\n\nWhen the plant is available, its average utilization factor (i.e., the fraction of rated capacity at which it is dispatched, conditional on being available) is $0.60$ in winter, $0.95$ in summer, and $0.85$ in the shoulder season. The forced outage rate is $\\mathrm{FOR} = 0.05$ and is independent of planned outages. The plant must take a total of $720$ planned-outage hours per year. Consider two alternative planned-outage schedules:\n- Schedule S (summer-focused): all $720$ planned-outage hours are taken in July.\n- Schedule W (winter-focused): all $720$ planned-outage hours are taken in January.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definition of capacity factor and the independence assumptions stated above, derive the expected annual capacity factor for each schedule and then quantify the impact of scheduling the planned outage in January instead of July by computing the difference\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathrm{CF} \\equiv \\mathrm{CF}_{\\mathrm{W}} - \\mathrm{CF}_{\\mathrm{S}}.\n$$\nExpress $\\Delta \\mathrm{CF}$ as a pure decimal (unitless) and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the difference in the expected annual capacity factor between two planned outage schedules for a thermal power plant. The fundamental definition of the capacity factor (CF) is given as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{CF} \\equiv \\frac{1}{C_{r} T} \\int_{0}^{T} P(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nwhere $C_r$ is the rated capacity, $T$ is the total period in hours, and $P(t)$ is the realized power output at time $t$. Since the forced outages are stochastic, we should work with the expected value of the power output, $E[P(t)]$. The expected capacity factor is then:\n$$\n\\mathrm{CF} = \\frac{1}{C_{r} T} \\int_{0}^{T} E[P(t)]\\,\\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nThe expected power output at any time $t$ is the product of three terms: the plant's rated capacity $C_r$, the utilization factor $U(t)$ if the plant is available, and the probability of the plant being available.\n\nThe availability of the plant is affected by two independent phenomena: planned outages and forced outages.\n1.  **Planned Outages**: These are scheduled events. We can define an indicator function $A_{PO}(t)$ which is $1$ if the plant is not scheduled for a planned outage at time $t$, and $0$ otherwise.\n2.  **Forced Outages**: These are stochastic events. The problem states that the forced outage rate is $\\mathrm{FOR} = 0.05$. The expected availability during non-planned-outage hours is $1 - \\mathrm{FOR}$. This is the probability that the plant is not in a forced outage state.\n\nSince planned and forced outages are independent, the total probability of the plant being available (i.e., able to generate power) at time $t$ is the product of the probabilities of not being in a planned outage and not being in a forced outage. Thus, the expected power output is:\n$$\nE[P(t)] = C_r \\times U(t) \\times A_{PO}(t) \\times (1 - \\mathrm{FOR})\n$$\nwhere $U(t)$ is the utilization factor at time $t$, which is conditional on the plant being available.\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for the expected capacity factor:\n$$\n\\mathrm{CF} = \\frac{1}{C_{r} T} \\int_{0}^{T} C_r U(t) A_{PO}(t) (1 - \\mathrm{FOR}) \\,\\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nThe rated capacity $C_r$ cancels out, and the term $(1 - \\mathrm{FOR})$ is constant, so we can move it outside the integral:\n$$\n\\mathrm{CF} = \\frac{1 - \\mathrm{FOR}}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} U(t) A_{PO}(t) \\,\\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nThe integral can be evaluated by splitting the year into the three defined seasons: Winter (W), Summer (S), and Shoulder (Sh). The utilization factor $U(t)$ is constant within each season ($U_W$, $U_S$, $U_{Sh}$). Let $T_k$ be the total hours in season $k$ and $H_{PO,k}$ be the number of planned outage hours scheduled in season $k$. The integral of $A_{PO}(t)$ over season $k$ is the total time the plant is not on a planned outage, which is $T_k - H_{PO,k}$.\nThe integral thus becomes a sum:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T} U(t) A_{PO}(t) \\,\\mathrm{d}t = U_W(T_W - H_{PO,W}) + U_S(T_S - H_{PO,S}) + U_{Sh}(T_{Sh} - H_{PO,Sh})\n$$\nSo, the general formula for the annual capacity factor is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{CF} = \\frac{1 - \\mathrm{FOR}}{T} \\left[ U_W(T_W - H_{PO,W}) + U_S(T_S - H_{PO,S}) + U_{Sh}(T_{Sh} - H_{PO,Sh}) \\right]\n$$\nWe are given a total of $H_{PO} = 720$ planned outage hours.\n\nFor Schedule S (summer-focused), all $720$ hours are in July, which is part of the summer season.
