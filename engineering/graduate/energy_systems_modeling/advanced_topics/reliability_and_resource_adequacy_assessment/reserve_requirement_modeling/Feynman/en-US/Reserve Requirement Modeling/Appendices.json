            "problem": "A single-bus power system operated by an Independent System Operator (ISO) schedules energy day-ahead and procures upward operating reserve to hedge uncertainty in the real-time net demand (net load) forecast error. Let the net load forecast error be a random variable $X$ defined as realized net load minus forecast net load. Assume $X$ is zero-mean Gaussian with standard deviation $\\sigma$, that is $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^{2})$. The ISO specifies an upward reserve requirement $R^{\\uparrow}$ such that the probability that $X$ exceeds $R^{\\uparrow}$ is at most $\\alpha$, reflecting a chance constraint on the loss-of-load event. This can be stated as $\\mathbb{P}(X > R^{\\uparrow}) \\le \\alpha$, which is equivalent to $\\mathbb{P}(X \\le R^{\\uparrow}) \\ge 1-\\alpha$.\n\nStarting from the definitions of a chance constraint and the cumulative distribution function of a continuous random variable, derive an expression for the minimum $R^{\\uparrow}$ that satisfies the above probabilistic requirement as a function of $\\sigma$ and $\\alpha$. Then, using $\\sigma = 200$ MW, compute $R^{\\uparrow}$ for $\\alpha = 0.05$ and for $\\alpha = 0.01$. Explain briefly, in words, how tightening $\\alpha$ changes $R^{\\uparrow}$ and what this implies about the trade-off between procurement cost and violation probability under a linear reserve procurement cost.\n\nExpress the two computed reserve requirements in megawatts (MW) and round each to $4$ significant figures. In your final answer, report the pair as a row matrix $\\big(R^{\\uparrow}(\\alpha=0.05),\\,R^{\\uparrow}(\\alpha=0.01)\\big)$ with no units.",
            "solution": "The problem has been validated and is deemed sound, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard application of statistical principles to power system operations, specifically in the context of reserve procurement under uncertainty. All necessary data and definitions are provided.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the minimum upward reserve requirement, $R^{\\uparrow}$, that satisfies a probabilistic constraint on the net load forecast error. Let $X$ be the random variable representing this error, with $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$. The constraint is given as:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(X > R^{\\uparrow}) \\le \\alpha\n$$\nThis inequality states that the probability of a shortfall event, where the forecast error $X$ exceeds the procured reserve $R^{\\uparrow}$, must be no greater than a specified tolerance level $\\alpha$.\n\nUsing the property of complementary events, this is equivalent to:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(X \\le R^{\\uparrow}) \\ge 1-\\alpha\n$$\nThe term on the left, $\\mathbb{P}(X \\le R^{\\uparrow})$, is the definition of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the random variable $X$, evaluated at $R^{\\uparrow}$. Let us denote the CDF of $X$ as $F_X(x)$. The constraint can thus be written as:\n$$\nF_X(R^{\\uparrow}) \\ge 1-\\alpha\n$$\nWe are asked to find the minimum value of $R^{\\uparrow}$ that satisfies this condition. For a continuous random variable with a strictly increasing CDF (such as the Gaussian distribution), the minimum value of $R^{\\uparrow}$ that satisfies the inequality is the one that achieves equality:\n$$\nF_X(R^{\\uparrow}) = 1-\\alpha\n$$\nTo solve for $R^{\\uparrow}$, we can standardize the random variable $X$. Let $Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}$. Given that $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$, its mean is $\\mu=0$. The standardized variable is $Z = X/\\sigma$, which follows the standard normal distribution, $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$. The CDF of the standard normal distribution is commonly denoted by $\\Phi(z)$.\n\nWe can express $F_X(R^{\\uparrow})$ in terms of $\\Phi(z)$:\n$$\nF_X(R^{\\uparrow}) = \\mathbb{P}(X \\le R^{\\uparrow}) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(\\frac{X}{\\sigma} \\le \\frac{R^{\\uparrow}}{\\sigma}\\right) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(Z \\le \\frac{R^{\\uparrow}}{\\sigma}\\right) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{R^{\\uparrow}}{\\sigma}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this back into our equality, we get:\n$$\n\\Phi\\left(\\frac{R^{\\uparrow}}{\\sigma}\\right) = 1-\\alpha\n$$\nTo isolate $R^{\\uparrow}$, we apply the inverse of the standard normal CDF, denoted $\\Phi^{-1}$, to both sides of the equation. The function $\\Phi^{-1}(p)$ gives the value $z$ such that $\\mathbb{P}(Z \\le z) = p$; it is also known as the quantile function or the probit function.\n$$\n\\frac{R^{\\uparrow}}{\\sigma} = \\Phi^{-1}(1-\\alpha)\n$$\nSolving for $R^{\\uparrow}$ yields the general expression for the minimum required upward reserve:\n$$\nR^{\\uparrow} = \\sigma \\cdot \\Phi^{-1}(1-\\alpha)\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical values using the given data: $\\sigma = 200$ MW.\n\nCase 1: $\\alpha = 0.05$\nThe required probability level is $1-\\alpha = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95$. We need to find the value of the standard normal quantile function for a probability of $0.95$.\n$$\nR^{\\uparrow}(\\alpha=0.05) = 200 \\cdot \\Phi^{-1}(0.95)\n$$\nFrom standard statistical tables or computation, $\\Phi^{-1}(0.95) \\approx 1.6448536$.\n$$\nR^{\\uparrow}(\\alpha=0.05) = 200 \\cdot 1.6448536 \\approx 328.97072 \\text{ MW}\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, we get $R^{\\uparrow}(\\alpha=0.05) = 329.0$ MW.\n\nCase 2: $\\alpha = 0.01$\nThe required probability level is $1-\\alpha = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99$. We need to find the value of the standard normal quantile function for a probability of $0.99$.\n$$\nR^{\\uparrow}(\\alpha=0.01) = 200 \\cdot \\Phi^{-1}(0.99)\n$$\nFrom standard statistical tables or computation, $\\Phi^{-1}(0.99) \\approx 2.3263479$.\n$$\nR^{\\uparrow}(\\alpha=0.01) = 200 \\cdot 2.3263479 \\approx 465.26958 \\text{ MW}\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, we get $R^{\\uparrow}(\\alpha=0.01) = 465.3$ MW.\n\nFinally, we explain the effect of tightening $\\alpha$ on $R^{\\uparrow}$ and the implied trade-off.\nTightening $\\alpha$ means decreasing its value (e.g., from $0.05$ to $0.01$). This corresponds to demanding a higher level of reliability, as the acceptable probability of a shortfall event is reduced. As $\\alpha$ decreases, the term $1-\\alpha$ increases (e.g., from $0.95$ to $0.99$). The inverse CDF of the standard normal distribution, $\\Phi^{-1}(p)$, is a strictly increasing function of the probability $p$. Therefore, a smaller $\\alpha$ leads to a larger value for $\\Phi^{-1}(1-\\alpha)$. Since $R^{\\uparrow}$ is directly proportional to $\\Phi^{-1}(1-\\alpha)$, a smaller $\\alpha$ results in a larger required reserve $R^{\\uparrow}$. This is observed in our calculations, where $R^{\\uparrow}$ increased from $329.0$ MW to $465.3$ MW as $\\alpha$ was tightened from $0.05$ to $0.01$.\n\nThe trade-off involves system operational cost versus system reliability. Assuming a linear procurement cost, the cost of reserves is proportional to the amount procured, $R^{\\uparrow}$.\n1.  **High Reliability (Low $\\alpha$)**: Choosing a very small $\\alpha$ (e.g., $0.01$) ensures that the system is very secure against forecast errors, with a low probability of load-shedding. However, this requires procuring a large amount of reserve $R^{\\uparrow}$, which leads to a high operational cost.\n2.  **Low Cost (High $\\alpha$)**: Choosing a larger $\\alpha$ (e.g., $0.05$) reduces the amount of reserve $R^{\\uparrow}$ that must be procured, thereby lowering operational costs. However, this comes at the expense of lower reliability, as the system operator accepts a higher probability of a shortfall.\nThe ISO must balance these competing objectives, selecting an $\\alpha$ that provides an acceptable level of reliability without imposing excessive costs.",

Upward operating reserve is defined as headroom that can be converted to energy within the response timeline.

The objective is to minimize the total cost of energy and reserve, subject to a set of operational constraints.\n\nFirst, we formulate the optimization problem based on the provided data and definitions.\nThe decision variables are the energy output $p_i$ and reserve allocation $r_i$ for each unit $i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$.\nThe objective function to be minimized is the total cost $C$:\n$$ C(p_1, p_2, r_1, r_2) = c_1 p_1 + c_2 p_2 + c_1^{R} r_1 + c_2^{R} r_2 $$\nSubstituting the given cost coefficients $c = [\\,20,\\,30\\,]$ and $c^{R} = [\\,5,\\,8\\,]$:\n$$ \\min_{p_1, p_2, r_1, r_2} \\left( 20 p_1 + 30 p_2 + 5 r_1 + 8 r_2 \\right) $$\n\nThe optimization is subject to the following constraints:\n1.

Headroom constraint for unit 2: $p_2 + r_2 \\leq P_2^{\\max} = 300$\n5.  Nonnegativity constraints: $p_1, p_2, r_1, r_2 \\geq 0$\n\nA key step in solving this problem is to analyze the interplay between the constraints. Let us sum the two headroom constraints (3) and (4):\n$$ (p_1 + r_1) + (p_2 + r_2) \\leq P_1^{\\max} + P_2^{\\max} $$\n$$ (p_1 + p_2) + (r_1 + r_2) \\leq 500 + 300 $$\n$$ (p_1 + p_2) + (r_1 + r_2) \\leq 800 $$\n\nFrom the power balance constraint (1), we know that $p_1 + p_2 = 700$. Substituting this into the summed inequality:\n$$ 700 + (r_1 + r_2) \\leq 800 $$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$ r_1 + r_2 \\leq 100 $$\n\nWe now have two constraints on the total reserve: $r_1 + r_2 \\geq 100$ from the reserve requirement and $r_1 + r_2 \\leq 100$ derived from the headroom constraints. The only way to satisfy both is for the equality to hold:\n$$ r_1 + r_2 = 100 $$\nThis implies that the upward reserve requirement constraint must be binding at the optimum.\n\nFurthermore, substituting $r_1 + r_2 = 100$ back into the summed headroom inequality gives:\n$$ 700 + 100 \\leq 800 \\implies 800 \\leq 800 $$\nThis shows that the summed headroom inequality is also binding. Since $p_1 + r_1 \\leq 500$ and $p_2 + r_2 \\leq 300$, their sum can only equal $800$ if both individual headroom constraints are binding. Therefore:\n$$ p_1 + r_1 = 500 $$\n$$ p_2 + r_2 = 300 $$\n\nThe original optimization problem is now reduced to solving a system of linear equations, where the solution must be selected to minimize the cost function. We have the following system:\n(a) $p_1 + p_2 = 700$\n(b) $r_1 + r_2 = 100$\n(c) $p_1 + r_1 = 500$\n(d) $p_2 + r_2 = 300$\n\nWe can express all four variables in terms of a single variable, for instance $p_1$.\nFrom (c), we get $r_1 = 500 - p_1$.\nFrom (a), we get $p_2 = 700 - p_1$.\nFrom (d), we get $r_2 = 300 - p_2 = 300 - (700 - p_1) = p_1 - 400$.\nA quick check shows these expressions are consistent with (b): $r_1 + r_2 = (500 - p_1) + (p_1 - 400) = 100$.\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions into the cost function to formulate it in terms of $p_1$ only:\n$$ C(p_1) = 20 p_1 + 30(700 - p_1) + 5(500 - p_1) + 8(p_1 - 400) $$\n$$ C(p_1) = 20 p_1 + 21000 - 30 p_1 + 2500 - 5 p_1 + 8 p_1 - 3200 $$\n$$ C(p_1) = (20 - 30 - 5 + 8) p_1 + (21000 + 2500 - 3200) $$\n$$ C(p_1) = -7 p_1 + 20300 $$\n\nTo minimize $C(p_1)$, which is a linear function with a negative slope, we must make $p_1$ as large as possible. The feasible range for $p_1$ is determined by the nonnegativity constraints on all variables:\n- $p_1 \\geq 0$\n- $p_2 = 700 - p_1 \\geq 0 \\implies p_1 \\leq 700$\n- $r_1 = 500 - p_1 \\geq 0 \\implies p_1 \\leq 500$\n- $r_2 = p_1 - 400 \\geq 0 \\implies p_1 \\geq 400$\n\nCombining these inequalities, the feasible range for $p_1$ is $p_1 \\in [400, 500]$.\nTo minimize $C(p_1) = -7 p_1 + 20300$, we must select the maximum value of $p_1$ in this interval. Thus, the optimal value is:\n$$ p_1^{\\star} = 500~\\text{MW} $$\n\nWe can now determine the optimal values for the other variables by back-substitution:\n- $p_2^{\\star} = 700 - p_1^{\\star} = 700 - 500 = 200~\\text{MW}$\n- $r_1^{\\star} = 500 - p_1^{\\star} = 500 - 500 = 0~\\text{MW}$\n- $r_2^{\\star} = p_1^{\\star} - 400 = 500 - 400 = 100~\\text{MW}$\n\nThe optimal solution is $(p_1^{\\star}, p_2^{\\star}, r_1^{\\star}, r_2^{\\star}) = (500, 200, 0, 100)$.

Calculate the current time $t_k = k \\cdot \\Delta t$.\n    b. Compute the reserve power at time $t_k$: $u_k = \\min(P_{\\mathrm{res}}, \\alpha \\cdot \\max(0, t_k - \\tau))$.\n    c. Calculate the frequency deviation at the next time step, $\\Delta f_{k+1}$, using the Forward Euler update rule:\n    $$\n    \\Delta f_{k+1} = \\Delta f_k + \\frac{\\Delta t}{M} ( - D \\cdot \\Delta f_k - \\Delta P + u_k )\n    $$\n    d. Store this value in `delta_f[k+1]`.\n$5$. After the loop completes, find the minimum value in the `delta_f` array: $\\Delta f_{\\min} = \\min_{k} \\Delta f_k$.\n$6$. Calculate the frequency nadir: $f_{\\mathrm{nadir}} = f_0 + \\Delta f_{\\min}$.\n$7$. Determine reserve adequacy by comparing the nadir to the threshold: the result is `True` if $f_{\\mathrm{nadir}} \\ge f_{\\mathrm{thr}}$ and `False` otherwise.\n\nThis procedure is systematically applied to each of the five provided test cases to generate the final list of boolean adequacy results.",
