            "problem": "Consider a $3$-bus chain network with buses labeled $1$–$2$–$3$ and transmission lines $\\{1,2\\}$ and $\\{2,3\\}$ of reactances $x_{12}=0.3$ (per unit) and $x_{23}=0.6$ (per unit), respectively. Assume the Direct-Current (DC) power flow approximation, where voltage magnitudes are fixed at $1$ (per unit), angle differences are small, line resistances are negligible, and real power flows are proportional to angle differences scaled by line susceptances. Let the Power Transfer Distribution Factor (PTDF) denote the fraction of a specified power transaction that appears as flow on a given line. Define the transaction as an injection of $1$ (per unit) at bus $1$ and an equal withdrawal of $1$ (per unit) at bus $3$, with bus $2$ experiencing zero net injection. Adopt the positive flow orientation from the lower-numbered bus to the higher-numbered bus on each line. Use bus $2$ as the angle reference, i.e., set $\\theta_{2}=0$, and use only fundamental network laws and the DC approximation to derive the bus angles and line flows produced by the transaction. Then compute the two PTDF values $PTDF_{23,(1,3)}$ and $PTDF_{12,(1,3)}$ and explain, based on the reactances and the series topology, why their relative magnitudes take the values you obtain. Express your final answer as dimensionless numbers in a single row matrix ordered as $\\left(PTDF_{23,(1,3)},\\,PTDF_{12,(1,3)}\\right)$. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the standard Direct-Current (DC) power flow approximation used in power system analysis, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information to yield a unique solution, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We may, therefore, proceed with the solution.\n\nThe DC power flow model approximates the real power flow on a transmission line between bus $i$ and bus $j$, denoted as $P_{ij}$, using the equation:\n$$P_{ij} = b_{ij}(\\theta_i - \\theta_j)$$\nwhere $\\theta_i$ and $\\theta_j$ are the voltage phase angles at the respective buses, and $b_{ij}$ is the susceptance of the line, which is the negative of the imaginary part of the line's admittance. For a line with only reactance $x_{ij}$ and negligible resistance, the susceptance is given by $b_{ij} = \\frac{1}{x_{ij}}$.\n\nThe given line reactances are $x_{12} = 0.3$ per unit and $x_{23} = 0.6$ per unit. The corresponding susceptances are:\n$$b_{12} = \\frac{1}{x_{12}} = \\frac{1}{0.3} \\text{ per unit}$$\n$$b_{23} = \\frac{1}{x_{23}} = \\frac{1}{0.6} \\text{ per unit}$$\n\nThe net real power injection at a bus $k$, denoted $P_k$, is the sum of the power flows leaving the bus on all connected lines:\n$$P_k = \\sum_{j} P_{kj} = \\sum_{j} b_{kj}(\\theta_k - \\theta_j)$$\n\nWe are given the power injections for a transaction of $1$ per unit from bus $1$ to bus $3$:\n-   Injection at bus $1$: $P_1 = 1$ p.u.\n-   Net injection at bus $2$: $P_2 = 0$ p.u.\n-   Withdrawal at bus $3$: $P_3 = -1$ p.u.\n\nBus $2$ is designated as the reference bus (or slack bus), which means its voltage angle is fixed at zero: $\\theta_2 = 0$.\n\nWe can now write the power balance equations for the non-reference buses, bus $1$ and bus $3$, to solve for their angles, $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_3$.\n\nFor bus $1$, the power balance equation is:\n$$P_1 = P_{12} = b_{12}(\\theta_1 - \\theta_2)$$\nSubstituting the known values $P_1 = 1$, $b_{12} = \\frac{1}{0.3}$, and $\\theta_2 = 0$:\n$$1 = \\frac{1}{0.3}(\\theta_1 - 0) \\implies \\theta_1 = 0.3 \\text{ radians}$$\n\nFor bus $3$, the power balance equation is:\n$$P_3 = P_{32} = b_{32}(\\theta_3 - \\theta_2)$$\nSince the line is between bus $2$ and bus $3$, $b_{32} = b_{23}$. Substituting the known values $P_3 = -1$, $b_{23} = \\frac{1}{0.6}$, and $\\theta_2 = 0$:\n$$-1 = \\frac{1}{0.6}(\\theta_3 - 0) \\implies \\theta_3 = -0.6 \\text{ radians}$$\n\nWe can verify these angles by checking if they satisfy the power balance at bus $2$, where the net injection $P_2$ must be $0$.\n$$P_2 = P_{21} + P_{23} = b_{21}(\\theta_2 - \\theta_1) + b_{23}(\\theta_2 - \\theta_3)$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$P_2 = \\frac{1}{0.3}(0 - 0.3) + \\frac{1}{0.6}(0 - (-0.6)) = \\frac{-0.3}{0.3} + \\frac{0.6}{0.6} = -1 + 1 = 0$$\nThe values are consistent with the problem statement. The bus angles are $\\theta_1 = 0.3$, $\\theta_2 = 0$, and $\\theta_3 = -0.6$ radians.\n\nNext, we compute the power flow on each line. The problem specifies a positive flow orientation from the lower-numbered bus to the higher-numbered bus.\n-   Flow on line $\\{1,2\\}$, denoted $F_{12}$:\n    $$F_{12} = b_{12}(\\theta_1 - \\theta_2) = \\frac{1}{0.3}(0.3 - 0) = 1 \\text{ p.u.}$$\n-   Flow on line $\\{2,3\\}$, denoted $F_{23}$:\n    $$F_{23} = b_{23}(\\theta_2 - \\theta_3) = \\frac{1}{0.6}(0 - (-0.6)) = \\frac{0.6}{0.6} = 1 \\text{ p.u.}$$\n\nThe Power Transfer Distribution Factor (PTDF) for a line $l$ with respect to a transaction from a source bus $s$ to a sink bus $r$, denoted $PTDF_{l,(s,r)}$, is the fraction of the transaction magnitude that flows on line $l$.\n$$PTDF_{l,(s,r)} = \\frac{F_l}{T_{sr}}$$\nIn this problem, the transaction is from bus $s=1$ to bus $r=3$, and its magnitude is $T_{1,3} = 1$ p.u. The PTDF values are numerically equal to the line flows we calculated.\n\nFor line $\\{1,2\\}$:\n$$PTDF_{12,(1,3)} = \\frac{F_{12}}{T_{1,3}} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1$$\n\nFor line $\\{2,3\\}$:\n$$PTDF_{23,(1,3)} = \\frac{F_{23}}{T_{1,3}} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1$$\n\nThe final task is to explain the relative magnitudes of these PTDFs. Both $PTDF_{12,(1,3)}$ and $PTDF_{23,(1,3)}$ are equal to $1$. This result is a direct consequence of the network's topology and the nature of the transaction. The network is a series or chain configuration ($1-2-3$). The transaction injects power at the beginning of the chain (bus $1$) and withdraws it at the end (bus $3$). The intermediate bus ($2$) is a transshipment node with zero net power injection ($P_2 = 0$).\n\nBy the principle of conservation of power (Kirchhoff's Current Law analogue), the power injected at bus $1$ must travel to its destination at bus $3$.\n1.  Since line $\\{1,2\\}$ is the only path out of bus $1$, the entire $1$ p.u. injection must flow on this line. This makes $F_{12} = 1$ p.u., and consequently $PTDF_{12,(1,3)} = 1$.\n2.  This $1$ p.u. of power arrives at bus $2$. Since the net injection at bus $2$ is zero, all power entering the bus must exit it. The only exit path towards the sink at bus $3$ is line $\\{2,3\\}$. Therefore, the entire $1$ p.u. of flow must continue onto line $\\{2,3\\}$. This makes $F_{23} = 1$ p.u., and consequently $PTDF_{23,(1,3)} = 1$.\n\nIn a simple series circuit like this, the 'current' (power flow) is the same through all series elements. The individual reactance values ($x_{12}$ and $x_{23}$) determine the voltage angle differences required to drive this flow ($\\theta_1 - \\theta_2 = 0.3$ and $\\theta_2 - \\theta_3 = 0.6$), but they do not alter the distribution of power, as there is only one path. If parallel paths existed, the reactances would determine how the flow splits, and the PTDFs would be fractions less than $1$.\n\nThe final answer is to be provided as a row matrix $(PTDF_{23,(1,3)}, PTDF_{12,(1,3)})$.",

All necessary data are provided, and the objective is clearly defined without any scientific or logical inconsistencies.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of the Power Transfer Distribution Factor (PTDF), specifically $\\mathrm{PTDF}_{12,(1,3)}$, which represents the active power flow on the line from bus $1$ to bus $2$, denoted as $P_{12}$, resulting from a unit power injection at bus $1$ ($P_1 = +1$ p.u.) and a unit power withdrawal at bus $3$ ($P_3 = -1$ p.u.). Since the network is self-contained for this transaction, the net injection at bus $2$ is zero ($P_2 = 0$ p.u.).\n\nAccording to the first principles of the DC power flow model, the active power flow $P_{ij}$ from bus $i$ to bus $j$ is given by:\n$$P_{ij} = \\frac{|V_i||V_j|}{x_{ij}} \\sin(\\delta_i - \\delta_j)$$\nWith the DC power flow assumptions ($|V_i| \\approx 1$ p.u. and small angle differences $\\delta_i - \\delta_j$), this simplifies to:\n$$P_{ij} = \\frac{1}{x_{ij}}(\\delta_i - \\delta_j)$$\nwhere $x_{ij}$ is the series reactance of the line and $\\delta_i$ is the voltage angle at bus $i$.\n\nThe net active power injection $P_i$ at any bus $i$ is the sum of the flows on all lines connected to it:\n$$P_i = \\sum_{j \\neq i} P_{ij} = \\sum_{j \\neq i} \\frac{1}{x_{ij}}(\\delta_i - \\delta_j)$$\nThis set of equations for all buses can be expressed in matrix form as $P = B_{bus}\\delta$, where $P$ is the vector of nodal power injections, $\\delta$ is the vector of bus voltage angles, and $B_{bus}$ is the nodal susceptance matrix.

The flow vector $f$ is defined for the oriented lines $\\{\\ell_{1}, \\ell_{2}, \\ell_{3}\\}$ as $f = \\begin{pmatrix} f_1 \\\\ f_2 \\\\ f_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} P_{12} \\\\ P_{23} \\\\ P_{13} \\end{pmatrix}$.\n- $f_1 = P_{12} = b_{12}(\\theta_1 - \\theta_2) = 4\\theta_1 - 4\\theta_2$\n- $f_2 = P_{23} = b_{23}(\\theta_2 - \\theta_3) = 5(\\theta_2 - 0) = 5\\theta_2$\n- $f_3 = P_{13} = b_{13}(\\theta_1 - \\theta_3) = 2.5(\\theta_1 - 0) = 2.5\\theta_1$\n\nIn matrix form, $f = C \\theta_{\\mathrm{red}}$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} f_1 \\\\ f_2 \\\\ f_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & -4 \\\\ 0 & 5 \\\\ 2.5 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\theta_1 \\\\ \\theta_2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe PTDF matrix $H$ maps the bus injections $P_{\\mathrm{red}}$ directly to the line flows $f$, such that $f = H P_{\\mathrm{red}}$. To find $H$, we substitute $\\theta_{\\mathrm{red}} = B_{\\mathrm{red}}^{-1} P_{\\mathrm{red}}$ into the flow equation:\n$$f = C \\theta_{\\mathrm{red}} = C (B_{\\mathrm{red}}^{-1} P_{\\mathrm{red}}) = (C B_{\\mathrm{red}}^{-1}) P_{\\mathrm{red}}$$\nThus, $H = C B_{\\mathrm{red}}^{-1}$. We can now compute the numerical entries of $H$:\n$$\nH = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & -4 \\\\ 0 & 5 \\\\ 2.5 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{42.5} \\begin{pmatrix} 9 & 4 \\\\ 4 & 6.5 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nH = \\frac{1}{42.5} \\begin{pmatrix} 4(9) - 4(4) & 4(4) - 4(6.5) \\\\ 0(9) + 5(4) & 0(4) + 5(6.5) \\\\ 2.5(9)+0(4) & 2.5(4)+0(6.5) \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{42.5} \\begin{pmatrix} 36 - 16 & 16 - 26 \\\\ 20 & 32.5 \\\\ 22.5 & 10 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nH = \\frac{1}{42.5} \\begin{pmatrix} 20 & -10 \\\\ 20 & 32.5 \\\\ 22.5 & 10 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTo simplify, we can work with fractions. $42.5 = \\frac{85}{2}$.\n$$\nH = \\frac{2}{85} \\begin{pmatrix} 20 & -10 \\\\ 20 & 32.5 \\\\ 22.5 & 10 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 40/85 & -20/85 \\\\ 40/85 & 65/85 \\\\ 45/85 & 20/85 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{17} \\begin{pmatrix} 8 & -4 \\\\ 8 & 13 \\\\ 9 & 4 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis is the PTDF matrix $H$. The first column gives the flow changes on lines $\\{\\ell_1, \\ell_2, \\ell_3\\}$ for a unit injection at bus $1$ (withdrawn at bus $3$), and the second column for a unit injection at bus $2$ (withdrawn at bus $3$).\n\n**2. Analysis of Transactions**\n\nWe convert the transaction amounts from MW to p.u. using $S_{\\mathrm{base}} = 100$ MW.\n\n**Transaction $\\mathcal{T}_{1}$**: Inject $115$ MW at bus $1$, withdraw $115$ MW at bus $3$.\nThe injection vector $P_{\\mathrm{red}}$ is:\n$P_1 = +115 \\text{ MW} = \\frac{115}{100} = 1.15$ p.u.\n$P_2 = 0$ p.u.\n$$P_{\\mathrm{red}}^{\\mathcal{T}_1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.15 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\text{ p.u.}$$\nThe line flows are $f^{\\mathcal{T}_1} = H P_{\\mathrm{red}}^{\\mathcal{T}_1}$:\n$$\nf^{\\mathcal{T}_1} = \\frac{1}{17} \\begin{pmatrix} 8 & -4 \\\\ 8 & 13 \\\\ 9 & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1.15 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1.15}{17} \\begin{pmatrix} 8 \\\\ 8 \\\\ 9 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{17} \\begin{pmatrix} 9.2 \\\\ 9.2 \\\\ 10.35 \\end{pmatrix} \\approx \\begin{pmatrix} 0.5412 \\\\ 0.5412 \\\\ 0.6088 \\end{pmatrix} \\text{ p.u.}\n$$\nSince all flow values are positive, the physical direction of flow on each line matches its given orientation:\n- $\\ell_{1}$: Flow is from bus $1$ to bus $2$.\n- $\\ell_{2}$: Flow is from bus $2$ to bus $3$.\n- $\\ell_{3}$: Flow is from bus $1$ to bus $3$.\n\n**Transaction $\\mathcal{T}_{2}$**: Inject $85$ MW at bus $2$, withdraw $85$ MW at bus $1$.\nThe injection vector $P_{\\mathrm{red}}$ is:\n$P_1 = -85 \\text{ MW} = \\frac{-85}{100} = -0.85$ p.u.\n$P_2 = +85 \\text{ MW} = \\frac{85}{100} = 0.85$ p.u.\n$$P_{\\mathrm{red}}^{\\mathcal{T}_2} = \\begin{pmatrix} -0.85 \\\\ 0.85 \\end{pmatrix} \\text{ p.u.}$$\nThe line flows are $f^{\\mathcal{T}_2} = H P_{\\mathrm{red}}^{\\mathcal{T}_2}$:\n$$\nf^{\\mathcal{T}_2} = \\frac{1}{17} \\begin{pmatrix} 8 & -4 \\\\ 8 & 13 \\\\ 9 & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -0.85 \\\\ 0.85 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{0.85}{17} \\begin{pmatrix} 8(-1) - 4(1) \\\\ 8(-1) + 13(1) \\\\ 9(-1) + 4(1) \\end{pmatrix} = 0.05 \\begin{pmatrix} -12 \\\\ 5 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -0.6 \\\\ 0.25 \\\\ -0.25 \\end{pmatrix} \\text{ p.u.}\n$$\nThe signs of the flows indicate the physical direction:\n- $\\ell_{1}$: $f_1 < 0$. Flow is from bus $2$ to bus $1$ (opposite to orientation).\n- $\\ell_{2}$: $f_2 > 0$. Flow is from bus $2$ to bus $3$ (matches orientation).\n- $\\ell_{3}$: $f_3 < 0$. Flow is from bus $3$ to bus $1$ (opposite to orientation).\n\n**3. Superposition for Net Flow on Line $\\ell_{1}$**\n\nThe DC power flow model is linear, so we can use superposition to find the total flow on line $\\ell_{1}$ when both transactions occur simultaneously. The total p.u. flow is the sum of the flows from each transaction.\n\n$$f_{1}^{\\text{total}} = f_{1}^{\\mathcal{T}_1} + f_{1}^{\\mathcal{T}_2}$$\nFrom the previous steps, $f_{1}^{\\mathcal{T}_1} = \\frac{9.2}{17}$ p.u. and $f_{1}^{\\mathcal{T}_2} = -0.6$ p.u.\n$$f_{1}^{\\text{total}} = \\frac{9.2}{17} - 0.6 = \\frac{9.2 - 0.6 \\times 17}{17} = \\frac{9.2 - 10.2}{17} = \\frac{-1.0}{17} \\text{ p.u.}$$\nTo express this flow in megawatts, we multiply by the base power $S_{\\mathrm{base}} = 100$ MW.\n$$P_{12}^{\\text{total}} = f_{1}^{\\text{total}} \\times S_{\\mathrm{base}} = \\left(-\\frac{1}{17}\\right) \\times 100 \\text{ MW} = -\\frac{100}{17} \\text{ MW}$$\nEvaluating this numerically:\n$$P_{12}^{\\text{total}} \\approx -5.8823529... \\text{ MW}$$\nThe problem asks for the result rounded to four significant figures.\n$$P_{12}^{\\text{total}} \\approx -5.882 \\text{ MW}$$\nThe sign convention states that positive flow on $\\ell_{1}$ is from bus $1$ to bus $2$. The negative sign indicates the net power flow is from bus $2$ to bus $1$.",
