This quantity is constrained by two factors: the available capacity headroom and the ramp-rate limit.\n\nThe initial power output of the online unit is given as $P(0) = 0.8 \\, P^{\\max}$.\nThe maximum power output is $P^{\\max}$.\nThe available capacity headroom, $\\Delta P_{\\text{headroom}}$, is the difference between the maximum and initial power levels:\n$$ \\Delta P_{\\text{headroom}} = P^{\\max} - P(0) = P^{\\max} - 0.8 \\, P^{\\max} = 0.2 \\, P^{\\max} $$\n\nThe upward ramp-rate limit is given as $R = 0.02 \\, P^{\\max} \\, \\text{min}^{-1}$.\nThe time window for spinning reserve is $T_{\\text{spin}} = 10 \\, \\text{min}$.\nThe maximum power increase achievable by ramping up for this duration, $\\Delta P_{\\text{ramp}}$, is:\n$$ \\Delta P_{\\text{ramp}} = R \\times T_{\\text{spin}} = (0.02 \\, P^{\\max} \\, \\text{min}^{-1}) \\times (10 \\, \\text{min}) = 0.2 \\, P^{\\max} $$\n\nThe actual spinning reserve, $SR_{10}$, is the minimum of the capacity headroom and the ramp-limited power increase.

This practice introduces a core principle of modern power system planning: using probabilistic methods to set reserve requirements.

            "problem": "An Independent System Operator (ISO) must determine the minimum synchronized spinning reserve capacity, denoted by $R^{\\mathrm{spin}}$, to cover short-horizon intra-interval net-load deviations over a $5$-minute interval. The stochastic deviation of net load from its forecast is modeled as a random variable $\\Delta NL$. Spinning reserves are synchronized and available immediately, and must cover upward deviations in net load over this short timescale, while slower non-spinning reserves are not considered for this intra-interval requirement.\n\nAssume the following foundational modeling premises:\n- The chance-constrained requirement is that the probability of the deviation being no larger than the scheduled spinning reserve satisfies $P\\!\\left(\\Delta NL \\le R^{\\mathrm{spin}}\\right) \\ge 1 - \\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon \\in (0,1)$ is a prespecified risk tolerance set by the ISO.\n- The net-load deviation is modeled as Gaussian with zero mean and finite variance, $\\Delta NL \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^{2})$, where $\\sigma > 0$ is known from historical estimation over the same timescale.\n- Spinning reserve $R^{\\mathrm{spin}}$ is the smallest nonnegative value that satisfies the chance constraint.\n\nStarting only from the above premises and the definition of the Gaussian cumulative distribution function, formulate the chance constraint mathematically and derive a closed-form expression for the minimal $R^{\\mathrm{spin}}$ as an explicit function of $\\sigma$ and $\\epsilon$.

The use of a Gaussian distribution to model forecast errors and the formulation of a chance constraint to determine reserve capacity are standard, well-established practices in stochastic modeling for power system security.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It asks for the minimum non-negative value of a variable subject to a probabilistic inequality. The properties of the Gaussian distribution ensure that a unique solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and formal mathematical language. Terms like \"Gaussian distribution\" and \"chance constraint\" are standard and unambiguous.\n- **Conclusion**: The problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity. It is a valid and solvable problem based on standard principles of applied probability theory.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\nThe objective is to find the smallest non-negative value of $R^{\\mathrm{spin}}$ that satisfies the given chance constraint.\n\nThe constraint is given by the inequality:\n$$\nP\\!\\left(\\Delta NL \\le R^{\\mathrm{spin}}\\right) \\ge 1 - \\epsilon\n$$\nWe are given that the net-load deviation $\\Delta NL$ follows a normal (Gaussian) distribution with a mean of $\\mu = 0$ and a variance of $\\sigma^2$, denoted as $\\Delta NL \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$.\n\nTo work with this probability, we standardize the random variable $\\Delta NL$. Let $Z$ be a standard normal random variable, defined as:\n$$\nZ = \\frac{\\Delta NL - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{\\Delta NL}{ \\sigma}\n$$\nBy definition, $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$. We can rewrite the inequality inside the probability operator in terms of $Z$. Since $\\sigma > 0$, dividing by $\\sigma$ does not change the direction of the inequality:\n$$\n\\Delta NL \\le R^{\\mathrm{spin}} \\iff \\frac{\\Delta NL}{\\sigma} \\le \\frac{R^{\\mathrm{spin}}}{\\sigma} \\iff Z \\le \\frac{R^{\\mathrm{spin}}}{\\sigma}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the chance constraint, we get:\n$$\nP\\!\\left(Z \\le \\frac{R^{\\mathrm{spin}}}{\\sigma}\\right) \\ge 1 - \\epsilon\n$$\nThe expression on the left, $P(Z \\le z)$, is the definition of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal random variable $Z$. Let us denote this function by $\\Phi(z)$. The constraint is therefore:\n$$\n\\Phi\\left(\\frac{R^{\\mathrm{spin}}}{\\sigma}\\right) \\ge 1 - \\epsilon\n$$\nWe need to find the smallest non-negative $R^{\\mathrm{spin}}$ that satisfies this condition. The standard normal CDF, $\\Phi(z)$, is a continuous and strictly monotonically increasing function. This means that to find the minimum value of $R^{\\mathrm{spin}}$ that satisfies the inequality, we can solve for the case where equality holds. A smaller value of $R^{\\mathrm{spin}}$ would result in a smaller value of the CDF, violating the constraint.\nThus, we set:\n$$\n\\Phi\\left(\\frac{R^{\\mathrm{spin}}}{\\sigma}\\right) = 1 - \\epsilon\n$$\nTo isolate the term $\\frac{R^{\\mathrm{spin}}}{\\sigma}$, we apply the inverse of the standard normal CDF to both sides of the equation. This inverse function is the standard normal quantile function, denoted by $\\Phi^{-1}(p)$.\n$$\n\\frac{R^{\\mathrm{spin}}}{\\sigma} = \\Phi^{-1}(1 - \\epsilon)\n$$\nSolving for $R^{\\mathrm{spin}}$ by multiplying by $\\sigma$ gives the minimal required reserve capacity:\n$$\nR^{\\mathrm{spin}} = \\sigma \\Phi^{-1}(1 - \\epsilon)\n$$\nFinally, we must confirm that this solution is consistent with the requirement that $R^{\\mathrm{spin}}$ be non-negative. The risk tolerance $\\epsilon$ is given as $\\epsilon \\in (0, 1)$. In the context of system reliability, $\\epsilon$ represents the probability of failure (i.e., the probability that the net-load deviation exceeds the reserve). This is typically a small number, such as $0.05$, $0.01$, or smaller. For any such practical value, $\\epsilon < 0.5$, which implies that the argument of the quantile function, $1 - \\epsilon$, is greater than $0.5$.\nThe median of the standard normal distribution is at $z=0$, so $\\Phi(0) = 0.5$. Because $\\Phi^{-1}(p)$ is a strictly increasing function, if its argument $p = 1 - \\epsilon > 0.5$, then its value must be positive, i.e., $\\Phi^{-1}(1 - \\epsilon) > 0$.\nGiven that $\\sigma > 0$, the product $\\sigma \\Phi^{-1}(1 - \\epsilon)$ is positive. Therefore, the non-negativity constraint is naturally satisfied, and this expression indeed represents the smallest non-negative value for $R^{\\mathrm{spin}}$.\nThe expression is analytic, as the inverse normal CDF, $\\Phi^{-1}$, is a standard mathematical function (related to the inverse error function). The final answer is given in megawatts (MW) as required, since $\\sigma$ is in MW and the quantile function is dimensionless.",
