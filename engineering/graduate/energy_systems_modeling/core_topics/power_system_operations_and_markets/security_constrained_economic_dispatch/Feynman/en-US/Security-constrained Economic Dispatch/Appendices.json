            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of power system engineering and convex optimization, is well-posed, and provides all necessary data for both the formulation and computational tasks.\n\nThe solution is presented in two parts as requested.\n\n**Task 1: Formulation of the Security-Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED)**\n\nThe Security-Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED) problem aims to determine the real power output of generators that minimizes the total cost of generation while satisfying physical and operational constraints across the power grid, both in the normal operating state (base case) and under a set of credible contingencies.\n\nThe mathematical formulation for this two-bus system is a constrained optimization problem, defined as follows:\n\n1.  **Decision Variables**: The real power outputs of the two generators are the variables to be optimized: $P_1$ and $P_2$, measured in $\\text{MW}$.\n\n2.  **Objective Function**: The objective is to minimize the total generation cost, which is the sum of the individual generator cost functions. The cost functions $C_1(P_1)$ and $C_2(P_2)$ are given as convex quadratic functions.\n    The total cost $C_{total}$ is:\n    $$\n    C_{total}(P_1, P_2) = C_1(P_1) + C_2(P_2) = (\\alpha_1 P_1^2 + \\beta_1 P_1 + \\gamma_1) + (\\alpha_2 P_2^2 + \\beta_2 P_2 + \\gamma_2)\n    $$\n    Substituting the given coefficient values $\\alpha_1 = 0.02$, $\\beta_1 = 8$, $\\gamma_1 = 10$, $\\alpha_2 = 0.04$, $\\beta_2 = 6$, and $\\gamma_2 = 5$:\n    $$\n    \\text{Minimize} \\quad C_{total}(P_1, P_2) = (0.02 P_1^2 + 8 P_1 + 10) + (0.04 P_2^2 + 6 P_2 + 5)\n    $$\n\n3.  **Constraints**: The optimization is subject to several equality and inequality constraints.\n\n    a.  **Nodal Power Balance**: For each bus (or node) in the network, the total real power injected must equal the total real power withdrawn. This is an expression of Kirchhoff's Current Law for power networks. Let $F_{AB}$ be the real power flow from Bus $A$ to Bus $B$. The net demands are $D_A = 80 \\, \\text{MW}$ and $D_B = 120 \\, \\text{MW}$. The nodal power balance equations are:\n    $$\n    \\text{Bus A:} \\quad P_1 - D_A - F_{AB} = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad P_1 - 80 - F_{AB} = 0\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\text{Bus B:} \\quad P_2 - D_B + F_{AB} = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad P_2 - 120 + F_{AB} = 0\n    $$\n    Note that summing these two equations yields $P_1 + P_2 - (D_A + D_B) = 0$, or $P_1 + P_2 = 200$, which is the system-wide power balance.\n\n    b.  **Generator Operating Bounds**: Each generator has minimum and maximum real power output limits.\n    $$\n    P_1^{\\min} \\le P_1 \\le P_1^{\\max} \\quad \\implies \\quad 0 \\le P_1 \\le 150\n    $$\n    $$\n    P_2^{\\min} \\le P_2 \\le P_2^{\\max} \\quad \\implies \\quad 0 \\le P_2 \\le 150\n    $$\n\n    c.  **Transmission Security Constraints**: These constraints ensure that the network remains within safe operating limits (e.g., thermal and voltage limits) both in the base case and under specified contingency scenarios. As requested, these are represented in an abstract form. For this two-bus system, the primary constraint is on the power flow $F_{AB}$. A general representation for a set of security constraints indexed by $k$ (where $k=0$ is the base case and $k > 0$ are contingencies) is:\n    $$\n    g_k(P_1, P_2, \\dots) \\le 0 \\quad \\text{for } k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N_c\\}\n    $$\n    In the context of a DC power flow model for the base case, the flow $F_{AB}$ is a function of the power injections, specifically $F_{AB} = P_1 - D_A$. The thermal limit on the transmission line would be expressed as $|F_{AB}| \\le F_{AB}^{\\max}$, which translates to:\n    $$\n    |P_1 - 80| \\le F_{AB}^{\\max}\n    $$\n    where $F_{AB}^{\\max}$ is the maximum permissible power flow on the line. SCED would include such constraints for the base case and post-contingency states.\n\nCombining these elements, the full SCED mathematical program is:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\underset{P_1, P_2}{\\text{minimize}}\n& & (0.02 P_1^2 + 8 P_1 + 10) + (0.04 P_2^2 + 6 P_2 + 5) \\\\\n& \\text{subject to}\n& & P_1 - 80 - F_{AB} = 0 \\\\\n& & & P_2 - 120 + F_{AB} = 0 \\\\\n& & & 0 \\le P_1 \\le 150 \\\\\n& & & 0 \\le P_2 \\le 150 \\\\\n& & & g_k(P_1, P_2, \\dots) \\le 0, \\quad \\forall k \\in K\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nwhere $F_{AB}$ is itself determined by network physics (e.g., voltage angles and impedance), and $g_k$ represents the set of all security constraints.\n\n**Task 2: Computation of the Baseline Economic Dispatch (ED)**\n\nFor the baseline Economic Dispatch, network constraints are ignored. The problem simplifies to minimizing the total cost subject only to the aggregate power balance and generator limits.\n\n1.  **Simplified Problem**:\n    $$\n    \\begin{aligned}\n    & \\underset{P_1, P_2}{\\text{minimize}}\n    & & C_{total}(P_1, P_2) = (0.02 P_1^2 + 8 P_1) + (0.04 P_2^2 + 6 P_2) \\\\\n    & \\text{subject to}\n    & & P_1 + P_2 = 200 \\\\\n    & & & 0 \\le P_1 \\le 150 \\\\\n    & & & 0 \\le P_2 \\le 150\n    \\end{aligned}\n    $$\n    The constant terms $\\gamma_1=10$ and $\\gamma_2=5$ have been dropped from the objective function as they do not influence the optimal values of $P_1$ and $P_2$.\n\n2.  **Optimality Conditions**: The necessary condition for optimality in a constrained problem of this type is given by the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. For the active power balance constraint, this simplifies to the well-known principle of equal incremental cost. This principle states that at the minimum total cost, all dispatched generators not at their output limits must operate at the same incremental (or marginal) cost, a value denoted by $\\lambda$.\n\n3.  **Incremental Cost Functions**: The incremental cost for each generator is the first derivative of its cost function with respect to its power output.\n    $$\n    IC_1(P_1) = \\frac{dC_1}{dP_1} = \\frac{d}{dP_1}(0.02 P_1^2 + 8 P_1 + 10) = 0.04 P_1 + 8\n    $$\n    $$\n    IC_2(P_2) = \\frac{dC_2}{dP_2} = \\frac{d}{dP_2}(0.04 P_2^2 + 6 P_2 + 5) = 0.08 P_2 + 6\n    $$\n\n4.  **Solving for Optimal Dispatch**: We first assume that neither generator is at its operating limit and set their incremental costs equal:\n    $$\n    IC_1(P_1) = IC_2(P_2) \\implies 0.04 P_1 + 8 = 0.08 P_2 + 6\n    $$\n    We have a system of two linear equations:\n    1) $0.04 P_1 - 0.08 P_2 = -2$\n    2) $P_1 + P_2 = 200$\n\n    From equation (2), we express $P_2$ in terms of $P_1$: $P_2 = 200 - P_1$. Substituting this into equation (1):\n    $$\n    0.04 P_1 - 0.08 (200 - P_1) = -2\n    $$\n    $$\n    0.04 P_1 - 16 + 0.08 P_1 = -2\n    $$\n    $$\n    0.12 P_1 = 14\n    $$\n    $$\n    P_1^{\\star} = \\frac{14}{0.12} = \\frac{1400}{12} = \\frac{350}{3} \\, \\text{MW}\n    $$\n    Now, we find the corresponding optimal output for Generator $2$:\n    $$\n    P_2^{\\star} = 200 - P_1^{\\star} = 200 - \\frac{350}{3} = \\frac{600 - 350}{3} = \\frac{250}{3} \\, \\text{MW}\n    $$\n\n5.  **Verification of Limits**: We must check if these optimal values lie within the generators' operating bounds.\n    For Generator $1$: $P_1^{\\star} = \\frac{350}{3} \\approx 116.67 \\, \\text{MW}$. The bounds are $[0, 150]$. Since $0 \\le 116.67 \\le 150$, the constraint is satisfied.\n    For Generator $2$: $P_2^{\\star} = \\frac{250}{3} \\approx 83.33 \\, \\text{MW}$. The bounds are $[0, 150]$. Since $0 \\le 83.33 \\le 150$, the constraint is satisfied.\n\n    Since both optimal values are within their respective limits, the initial assumption was correct, and this solution is the global optimum.\n\n6.  **Final Answer Calculation**: The problem requires the answers to be rounded to four significant figures.\n    $$\n    P_1^{\\star} = \\frac{350}{3} \\approx 116.666... \\, \\text{MW} \\implies 116.7 \\, \\text{MW}\n    $$\n    $$\n    P_2^{\\star} = \\frac{250}{3} \\approx 83.333... \\, \\text{MW} \\implies 83.33 \\, \\text{MW}\n    $$\n    The final answer is the ordered pair $(P_1^{\\star}, P_2^{\\star})$.",

This structure defines a standard linear programming problem, which is known to have a unique and stable solution.\n- **Objective:** The problem statement is precise, using standard terminology from the field of power systems economics without ambiguity or subjective language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a standard textbook problem in Security-Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED). The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the optimal power output of two generators, $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$, to minimize total cost while satisfying demand and all physical constraints of the system.\n\nThe total cost of generation, $C$, is a linear function of the generator outputs:\n$$C(p_{1}, p_{2}) = c_{1}p_{1} + c_{2}p_{2} = 10p_{1} + 25p_{2}$$\n\nThe constraints are as follows:\n1.  **System-wide Power Balance:** The total generation must equal the total demand since losses are ignored.\n    $$p_{1} + p_{2} = d_{1} + d_{2}$$\n    $$p_{1} + p_{2} = 40 + 160 = 200$$\n\n2.  **Generator Operating Limits:** Each generator's output must be non-negative and not exceed its maximum capacity.\n    $$0 \\le p_{1} \\le \\overline{p}_{1} \\implies 0 \\le p_{1} \\le 200$$\n    $$0 \\le p_{2} \\le \\overline{p}_{2} \\implies 0 \\le p_{2} \\le 200$$\n\n3.  **Nodal Power Balance and Line Flow:** The DC power flow model relates the net power injection at each bus to the power flows on the lines connected to it.\n    - At Bus 1, the net injection is generation minus demand, which must equal the power flowing out on the line to Bus 2:\n      $$p_{1} - d_{1} = f \\implies p_{1} - 40 = f$$\n    - At Bus 2, the net injection is generation minus demand, which must equal the power flowing out. Since $f$ is defined as flow from 1 to 2, the flow out of Bus 2 is $-f$:\n      $$p_{2} - d_{2} = -f \\implies p_{2} - 160 = -f$$\n      Note that summing these two nodal balance equations gives $p_{1} + p_{2} - (d_{1} + d_{2}) = 0$, which is consistent with the system-wide power balance.\n\n4.  **Transmission Line Thermal Limit:** The absolute value of the power flow on the line cannot exceed its thermal limit.\n    $$|f| \\le \\overline{f} \\implies -100 \\le f \\le 100$$\n\nFirst, we solve the simple Economic Dispatch (ED) problem ignoring the transmission line limit (Constraint 4) to establish a baseline. The objective is to minimize $10p_{1} + 25p_{2}$ subject to $p_{1} + p_{2} = 200$ and generator capacity limits. Since $c_{1} < c_{2}$, it is most economical to use the cheaper generator ($G_1$) as much as possible. The total demand is $200$ MW, which is within the capacity of $G_1$ ($\\overline{p}_{1} = 200$ MW). Thus, the unconstrained ED solution is:\n$$p_{1}^{ED} = 200 \\text{ MW}, \\quad p_{2}^{ED} = 0 \\text{ MW}$$\n\nNow, we check if this dispatch is secure, i.e., whether it violates the transmission line limit. We calculate the resulting flow $f$ using the nodal balance equation for Bus 1:\n$$f = p_{1}^{ED} - d_{1} = 200 - 40 = 160 \\text{ MW}$$\nThe line limit is $\\overline{f} = 100$ MW. Since $|f| = 160 > 100$, the unconstrained ED solution is infeasible as it violates the security constraint. The transmission line is congested.\n\nTo find the correct solution, we must solve the full Security-Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED) problem, which includes the line limit. The optimization problem is:\nMinimize:\n$$C(p_{1}, p_{2}) = 10p_{1} + 25p_{2}$$\nSubject to:\n1.  $p_{1} + p_{2} = 200$\n2.  $0 \\le p_{1} \\le 200$\n3.  $0 \\le p_{2} \\le 200$\n4.  $-100 \\le p_{1} - 40 \\le 100$ (Substituting $f = p_{1} - 40$ into the line limit constraint)\n\nFrom constraint 4, we derive a new limit on $p_{1}$:\n$$-100 + 40 \\le p_{1} \\le 100 + 40$$\n$$-60 \\le p_{1} \\le 140$$\nCombining this with the generator limit $0 \\le p_{1} \\le 200$, the effective feasible range for $p_{1}$ becomes:\n$$\\max(0, -60) \\le p_{1} \\le \\min(200, 140)$$\n$$0 \\le p_{1} \\le 140$$\n\nNow, we can express the objective function solely in terms of $p_{1}$ by substituting $p_{2} = 200 - p_{1}$ from the power balance constraint:\n$$C(p_{1}) = 10p_{1} + 25(200 - p_{1}) = 10p_{1} + 5000 - 25p_{1} = 5000 - 15p_{1}$$\n\nTo minimize $C(p_{1})$, we must maximize the term $15p_{1}$, which means we must choose the largest possible value for $p_{1}$ within its feasible range. The upper bound for $p_{1}$ is $140$ MW.\nTherefore, the optimal dispatch for $p_{1}$ is:\n$$p_{1}^{\\star} = 140 \\text{ MW}$$\n\nThis value for $p_{1}$ corresponds to a line flow of $f = p_{1}^{\\star} - d_{1} = 140 - 40 = 100$ MW, which is exactly at the line limit. This confirms the constraint is binding.\n\nThe optimal dispatch for $p_{2}$ is then found from the power balance equation:\n$$p_{2}^{\\star} = 200 - p_{1}^{\\star} = 200 - 140 = 60 \\text{ MW}$$\n\nWe verify that this solution is feasible:\n- $p_{1}^{\\star} = 140$ is in $[0, 200]$.\n- $p_{2}^{\\star} = 60$ is in $[0, 200]$.\n- $p_{1}^{\\star} + p_{2}^{\\star} = 140 + 60 = 200$.\n- $f = 100$ which satisfies $|f| \\le 100$.\n\nThe binding transmission constraint forces a \"re-dispatch\" from the unconstrained economic optimum. The output of the cheaper generator ($G_1$) is reduced from $200$ MW to $140$ MW, and the more expensive generator ($G_2$) must be turned on and ramped up to $60$ MW to compensate. This re-dispatch to alleviate congestion is the essence of SCED. It also results in locational differentiation of energy prices (Locational Marginal Prices, or LMPs). At Bus 1, the marginal cost of supplying an extra megawatt is still $c_{1} = 10 \\$/\\text{MWh}$. However, at Bus 2, an extra megawatt of demand must be supplied by the local, more expensive generator $G_2$ (since the line is at its limit and cannot import more cheap power), so the marginal cost is $c_{2} = 25 \\$/\\text{MWh}$.\n\nThe final optimal generator dispatch is $[p_{1}^{\\star}, p_{2}^{\\star}]$.",
