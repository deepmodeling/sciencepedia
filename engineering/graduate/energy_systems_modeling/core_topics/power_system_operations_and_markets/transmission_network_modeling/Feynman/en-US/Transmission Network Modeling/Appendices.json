This first exercise focuses on the per-unit system, a cornerstone of power system analysis that standardizes calculations across different voltage and power levels. By converting the physical parameters of a high-voltage transmission line into their per-unit equivalents, you will practice a critical foundational skill and also quantify the importance of including shunt capacitance in your model, a factor that becomes non-negligible at extra-high voltages.

            "solution": "**Solution Formulation**\nThe solution requires two main parts: first, the calculation of the per-unit parameters of the transmission line, and second, the quantification of the reactive power error when shunt susceptance is neglected.\n\n**Part 1: Per-Unit Parameter Calculation**\nThe per-unit system normalizes quantities with respect to a chosen set of base values. The base impedance, $Z_{\\text{base}}$, is a derived base quantity calculated from the base voltage and base power. For a three-phase system, it is defined as:\n$$Z_{\\text{base}} = \\frac{(V_{\\text{base, LL}})^2}{S_{\\text{base, 3}\\phi}}$$\nwhere $V_{\\text{base, LL}}$ is the line-to-line voltage base and $S_{\\text{base, 3}\\phi}$ is the three-phase apparent power base.\n\nGiven the values:\n-   $V_{\\text{base}} = 500\\,\\mathrm{kV} = 500 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n-   $S_{\\text{base}} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{MVA} = 1000 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{VA}$\n\nWe calculate the base impedance:\n$$Z_{\\text{base}} = \\frac{(500 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{V})^2}{1000 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{VA}} = \\frac{25 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{V}^2}{1 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{VA}} = 250\\,\\Omega$$\n\nThe per-unit series impedance components, resistance $r$ and reactance $x$, are found by dividing the actual values ($R$ and $X$) by the base impedance.\nThe total series impedance of the line is $Z = R + jX$. The per-unit series impedance is $z = r + jx$.\n$$r = \\frac{R}{Z_{\\text{base}}} = \\frac{6.00\\,\\Omega}{250\\,\\Omega} = 0.024$$\n$$x = \\frac{X}{Z_{\\text{base}}} = \\frac{90.0\\,\\Omega}{250\\,\\Omega} = 0.36$$\n\nThe per-unit shunt susceptance, $b$, is found by multiplying the actual total shunt susceptance, $B$, by the base impedance. The actual shunt admittance is $Y_{\\text{sh}} = jB$. The per-unit shunt admittance $y_{\\text{sh}} = Y_{\\text{sh}} \\times Z_{\\text{base}} = jB \\times Z_{\\text{base}} = jb$.\n$$b = B \\times Z_{\\text{base}} = (1.357 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{S}) \\times (250\\,\\Omega) = 0.33925$$\n\nRounding to four significant figures, the per-unit parameters are:\n-   $r = 0.02400\\,\\mathrm{pu}$\n-   $x = 0.3600\\,\\mathrm{pu}$\n-   $b = 0.3393\\,\\mathrm{pu}$\n\n**Part 2: Reactive Power Error Calculation**\nThe error in reactive power accounting is the total reactive power generated by the line's shunt capacitance, which is neglected in a series-impedance-only model. In the $\\pi$-equivalent model, the total shunt susceptance $B$ is typically split into two equal parts, one at each end of the line. The total reactive power generated, $Q_C$, is the sum of the reactive powers from these two shunt elements.\n\nThe total three-phase reactive power generated by a shunt element is given by $Q_C = |V_{LL}|^2 B_{\\text{element}}$, where $|V_{LL}|$ is the magnitude of the line-to-line voltage at the element's location. The problem specifies to perform this calculation at the nominal $500\\,\\mathrm{kV}$ operating voltage. This implies we can assume the voltage magnitude across the line's shunt elements is constant and equal to the nominal line-to-line voltage, $|V_{\\text{nom}}| = 500\\,\\mathrm{kV}$.\n\nThe total reactive power generated by the entire line's shunt susceptance $B$ under this assumption is:\n$$Q_C = |V_{\\text{nom}}|^2 B$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$Q_C = (500 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{V})^2 \\times (1.357 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{S})$$\n$$Q_C = (25 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{V}^2) \\times (1.357 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{S}) = 3.3925 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{VAR} = 339.25\\,\\mathrm{MVAR}$$\n\nThis error must be expressed as a unitless per-unit quantity on the $S_{\\text{base}} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{MVA}$ base. The per-unit error, denoted as 'error', is:\n$$\\text{error} = \\frac{Q_C}{S_{\\text{base}}} = \\frac{339.25\\,\\mathrm{MVAR}}{1000\\,\\mathrm{MVA}} = 0.33925\\,\\mathrm{pu}$$\n\nAlternatively, this can be calculated directly in the per-unit system. The per-unit reactive power generated by a shunt susceptance $b$ is $q_C = v^2 b$, where $v$ is the per-unit voltage magnitude. The nominal operating voltage is $500\\,\\mathrm{kV}$, which is equal to the base voltage $V_{\\text{base}} = 500\\,\\mathrm{kV}$. Therefore, the per-unit voltage is:\n$$v = \\frac{|V_{\\text{nom}}|}{V_{\\text{base}}} = \\frac{500\\,\\mathrm{kV}}{500\\,\\mathrm{kV}} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{pu}$$\nThe error is the total reactive power generated, which is:\n$$\\text{error} = q_C = v^2 b = (1.0\\,\\mathrm{pu})^2 \\times b = b$$\nUsing the value for $b$ calculated previously:\n$$\\text{error} = 0.33925\\,\\mathrm{pu}$$\n\nRounding this value to four significant figures gives:\n-   $\\text{error} = 0.3393\\,\\mathrm{pu}$\n\n**Summary of Results**\nThe four requested quantities, rounded to four significant figures, are:\n-   Per-unit resistance $r = 0.02400$\n-   Per-unit reactance $x = 0.3600$\n-   Per-unit shunt susceptance $b = 0.3393$\n-   Per-unit reactive power error = $0.3393$\nThese are reported as a single row vector.",

            "solution": "The branch connecting bus $i$ and bus $k$ consists of an ideal transformer at bus $i$ followed by a $\\pi$-model transmission line. Let us define an intermediate node, denoted by $i'$, between the transformer and the line. The voltage at this node is $V_{i'}$.\n\nThe ideal transformer is located at bus $i$ with a complex tap ratio $a = t \\exp(j\\phi)$. The tap is on the primary side (bus $i$). The voltage at the secondary side (node $i'$) is given by:\n$$V_{i'} = \\frac{V_{i}}{a}$$\nFor an ideal lossless transformer, the complex power flowing in equals the complex power flowing out. Let $I_i$ be the current flowing from bus $i$ into the transformer, and let $I_{i'}$ be the current flowing out of the transformer into the line at node $i'$. The power conservation principle leads to the current relationship:\n$$I_i = \\frac{I_{i'}}{a^{*}}$$\nwhere $a^{*}$ is the complex conjugate of $a$, given by $a^{*} = t\\exp(-j\\phi)$.\n\nThe transmission line is represented by a $\\pi$-equivalent circuit with a series admittance $y$ between nodes $i'$ and $k$, and two shunt admittances of $y_{\\mathrm{sh}}/2$, one at node $i'$ and one at node $k$, both connected to the reference ground.\n\nWe aim to find the relationship between the injected currents $I_i, I_k$ and the bus voltages $V_i, V_k$ in the form:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} I_i \\\\ I_k \\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix} Y_{ii} & Y_{ik} \\\\ Y_{ki} & Y_{kk} \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} V_i \\\\ V_k \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nWe apply Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at nodes $k$ and $i'$. The injected current $I_k$ at bus $k$ is the sum of the currents flowing from bus $k$ into the series and shunt components of the line model.\n$$I_k = (V_k - V_{i'})y + V_k \\frac{y_{\\mathrm{sh}}}{2}$$\nSubstituting $V_{i'} = V_i/a$:\n$$I_k = \\left(V_k - \\frac{V_i}{a}\\right)y + V_k \\frac{y_{\\mathrm{sh}}}{2}$$\n$$I_k = -\\frac{y}{a} V_i + \\left(y + \\frac{y_{\\mathrm{sh}}}{2}\\right) V_k$$\nFrom this equation, we can directly identify the elements of the second row of the branch admittance matrix:\n$$Y_{ki} = -\\frac{y}{a}$$\n$$Y_{kk} = y + \\frac{y_{\\mathrm{sh}}}{2}$$\n\nNext, we apply KCL at the intermediate node $i'$. The current $I_{i'}$ flowing from the transformer into this node is equal to the sum of the currents flowing from node $i'$ into the series and shunt branches of the line.\n$$I_{i'} = (V_{i'} - V_k)y + V_{i'} \\frac{y_{\\mathrm{sh}}}{2} = V_{i'}\\left(y + \\frac{y_{\\mathrm{sh}}}{2}\\right) - V_k y$$\nNow, we relate this to the injected current $I_i$ at bus $i$ using the transformer current equation $I_i = I_{i'}/a^{*}$.\n$$I_i = \\frac{1}{a^{*}}\\left( V_{i'}\\left(y + \\frac{y_{\\mathrm{sh}}}{2}\\right) - V_k y \\right)$$\nSubstitute $V_{i'} = V_i/a$:\n$$I_i = \\frac{1}{a^{*}}\\left( \\frac{V_i}{a}\\left(y + \\frac{y_{\\mathrm{sh}}}{2}\\right) - V_k y \\right)$$\n$$I_i = \\frac{y + y_{\\mathrm{sh}}/2}{a a^{*}} V_i - \\frac{y}{a^{*}} V_k$$\nSince $a a^{*} = |a|^2 = t^2$, we can write:\n$$I_i = \\frac{y + y_{\\mathrm{sh}}/2}{t^2} V_i - \\frac{y}{a^{*}} V_k$$\nFrom this equation, we identify the elements of the first row of the branch admittance matrix:\n$$Y_{ii} = \\frac{y + y_{\\mathrm{sh}}/2}{t^2}$$\n$$Y_{ik} = -\\frac{y}{a^{*}}$$\n\nThe complete branch admittance contribution is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{Y}_{\\mathrm{branch}} = \n\\begin{pmatrix} \nY_{ii} & Y_{ik} \\\\ \nY_{ki} & Y_{kk} \n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix} \n\\frac{y + y_{\\mathrm{sh}}/2}{t^2} & -\\frac{y}{a^{*}} \\\\\n-\\frac{y}{a} & y + \\frac{y_{\\mathrm{sh}}}{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nNow we address the asymmetry of the off-diagonal terms.

A linear, time-invariant electrical network is reciprocal if its overall admittance matrix $\\mathbf{Y}_{\\mathrm{bus}}$ is symmetric, i.e., $\\mathbf{Y}_{\\mathrm{bus}} = \\mathbf{Y}_{\\mathrm{bus}}^T$. The off-diagonal terms of the branch admittance matrix, $Y_{ik}$ and $Y_{ki}$, are added to the corresponding positions in the global $\\mathbf{Y}_{\\mathrm{bus}}$ matrix. The presence of a phase-shifting transformer with $\\phi \\neq n\\pi$ introduces asymmetry into the branch contribution matrix. This asymmetry carries over to the global $\\mathbf{Y}_{\\mathrm{bus}}$, making the entire network non-reciprocal. A non-reciprocal network does not obey the reciprocity theorem, meaning that the ratio of excitation at one point to the response at another is not invariant if the positions of excitation and response are interchanged. The phase-shifting transformer acts as a non-reciprocal device, actively controlling power flow in a directional manner, which is its primary function.\n\nThe problem asks for the closed-form analytic expression for the off-diagonal element $Y_{ik}$, simplified in terms of $y$, $t$, and $\\phi$. As derived:\n$$Y_{ik} = -\\frac{y}{a^{*}} = -\\frac{y}{t\\exp(-j\\phi)} = -\\frac{y}{t}\\exp(j\\phi)$$\nThis is the final expression required.",

We solve the new system $B_{\\text{red}}^{\\text{open}} \\theta_{\\text{red}}^{\\text{open}} = P_{\\text{red}}$:\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\theta_1 \\\\ \\theta_2 \\\\ \\theta_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThis corresponds to the new system of equations:\n1. $2\\theta_1 - \\theta_2 = 0 \\implies \\theta_2 = 2\\theta_1$\n2. $-\\theta_1 + 2\\theta_2 - \\theta_3 = 1$\n3. $-\\theta_2 + 2\\theta_3 = 0 \\implies \\theta_2 = 2\\theta_3$\n\nAgain, $\\theta_1 = \\theta_3$. Substituting $\\theta_2 = 2\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_3 = \\theta_1$ into the new equation (2):\n$$-\\theta_1 + 2(2\\theta_1) - \\theta_1 = 1$$\n$$-\\theta_1 + 4\\theta_1 - \\theta_1 = 1$$\n$$2\\theta_1 = 1 \\implies \\theta_1 = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThe new angles are $\\theta_1^{\\text{open}} = \\frac{1}{2}$, $\\theta_2^{\\text{open}} = 2(\\frac{1}{2}) = 1$, and $\\theta_3^{\\text{open}} = \\frac{1}{2}$. The slack bus angle is still $\\theta_4 = 0$.\n\nThe new flow on line $(1,2)$ is $f_{12}^{\\text{open}} = b_{12}(\\theta_1^{\\text{open}} - \\theta_2^{\\text{open}})$.\n$$f_{12}^{\\text{open}} = 1 \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - 1\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2}$$\nThe PTDF for the \"open\" case is:\n$$\\text{PTDF}_{12}^{\\text{open}} = \\frac{f_{12}^{\\text{open}}}{P} = \\frac{-1/2}{1} = -\\frac{1}{2}$$\n\n**Part 3: Change in PTDF**\n\nFinally, we compute the change in the PTDF for line $(1,2)$ as specified:\n$$\\Delta \\text{PTDF}_{12} = \\text{PTDF}_{12}^{\\text{open}} - \\text{PTDF}_{12}^{\\text{closed}}$$\n$$\\Delta \\text{PTDF}_{12} = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{4}\\right)$$\n$$\\Delta \\text{PTDF}_{12} = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = -\\frac{2}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = -\\frac{1}{4}$$\nThe analysis has been conducted from first principles as required, by explicitly forming and solving the nodal equations for both network configurations.",
