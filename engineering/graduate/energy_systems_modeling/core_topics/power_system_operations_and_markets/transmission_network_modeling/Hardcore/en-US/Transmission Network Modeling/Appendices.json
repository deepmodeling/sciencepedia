            "solution": "The solution requires two main parts: first, the calculation of the per-unit parameters of the transmission line, and second, the quantification of the reactive power error when shunt susceptance is neglected.\n\n**Part 1: Per-Unit Parameter Calculation**\nThe per-unit system normalizes quantities with respect to a chosen set of base values. The base impedance, $Z_{\\text{base}}$, is a derived base quantity calculated from the base voltage and base power. For a three-phase system, it is defined as:\n$$Z_{\\text{base}} = \\frac{(V_{\\text{base, LL}})^2}{S_{\\text{base, 3}\\phi}}$$\nwhere $V_{\\text{base, LL}}$ is the line-to-line voltage base and $S_{\\text{base, 3}\\phi}$ is the three-phase apparent power base.\n\nGiven the values $V_{\\text{base}} = 500\\,\\mathrm{kV} = 500 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{V}$ and $S_{\\text{base}} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{MVA} = 1000 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{VA}$, we calculate the base impedance:\n$$Z_{\\text{base}} = \\frac{(500 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{V})^2}{1000 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{VA}} = \\frac{25 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{V}^2}{1 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{VA}} = 250\\,\\Omega$$\n\nThe per-unit series impedance components, resistance $r$ and reactance $x$, are found by dividing the actual values ($R$ and $X$) by the base impedance. The total series impedance of the line is $Z = R + jX$. The per-unit series impedance is $z = r + jx$.\n$$r = \\frac{R}{Z_{\\text{base}}} = \\frac{6.00\\,\\Omega}{250\\,\\Omega} = 0.024$$\n$$x = \\frac{X}{Z_{\\text{base}}} = \\frac{90.0\\,\\Omega}{250\\,\\Omega} = 0.36$$\n\nThe per-unit shunt susceptance, $b$, is found by multiplying the actual total shunt susceptance, $B$, by the base impedance. The actual shunt admittance is $Y_{\\text{sh}} = jB$. The per-unit shunt admittance $y_{\\text{sh}} = Y_{\\text{sh}} \\times Z_{\\text{base}} = jB \\times Z_{\\text{base}} = jb$.\n$$b = B \\times Z_{\\text{base}} = (1.357 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{S}) \\times (250\\,\\Omega) = 0.33925$$\n\nRounding to four significant figures, the per-unit parameters are:\n-   $r = 0.02400\\,\\mathrm{pu}$\n-   $x = 0.3600\\,\\mathrm{pu}$\n-   $b = 0.3393\\,\\mathrm{pu}$\n\n**Part 2: Reactive Power Error Calculation**\nThe error in reactive power accounting is the total reactive power generated by the line's shunt capacitance, which is neglected in a series-impedance-only model. In the $\\pi$-equivalent model, the total shunt susceptance $B$ is typically split into two equal parts, one at each end of the line. The total reactive power generated, $Q_C$, is the sum of the reactive powers from these two shunt elements.\n\nThe total three-phase reactive power generated by a shunt element is given by $Q_C = |V_{\\text{LL}}|^2 B$, where $|V_{\\text{LL}}|$ is the magnitude of the line-to-line voltage at the element's location. The problem specifies to perform this calculation at the nominal $500\\,\\mathrm{kV}$ operating voltage. This implies we can assume the voltage magnitude across the line's shunt elements is constant and equal to the nominal line-to-line voltage, $|V_{\\text{nom}}| = 500\\,\\mathrm{kV}$.\n\nThe total reactive power generated by the entire line's shunt susceptance $B$ under this assumption is:\n$$Q_C = |V_{\\text{nom}}|^2 B$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$Q_C = (500 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{V})^2 \\times (1.357 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{S})$$\n$$Q_C = (25 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{V}^2) \\times (1.357 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{S}) = 3.3925 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{VAR} = 339.25\\,\\mathrm{MVAR}$$\n\nThis error must be expressed as a unitless per-unit quantity on the $S_{\\text{base}} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{MVA}$ base. The per-unit error, denoted as 'error', is:\n$$\\text{error} = \\frac{Q_C}{S_{\\text{base}}} = \\frac{339.25\\,\\mathrm{MVAR}}{1000\\,\\mathrm{MVA}} = 0.33925\\,\\mathrm{pu}$$\n\nAlternatively, this can be calculated directly in the per-unit system. The per-unit reactive power generated by a shunt susceptance $b$ is $q_C = v^2 b$, where $v$ is the per-unit voltage magnitude. The nominal operating voltage is $500\\,\\mathrm{kV}$, which is equal to the base voltage $V_{\\text{base}} = 500\\,\\mathrm{kV}$. Therefore, the per-unit voltage is:\n$$v = \\frac{|V_{\\text{nom}}|}{V_{\\text{base}}} = \\frac{500\\,\\mathrm{kV}}{500\\,\\mathrm{kV}} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{pu}$$\nThe error is the total reactive power generated, which is:\n$$\\text{error} = q_C = v^2 b = (1.0\\,\\mathrm{pu})^2 \\times b = b$$\nUsing the value for $b$ calculated previously:\n$$\\text{error} = 0.33925\\,\\mathrm{pu}$$\n\nRounding this value to four significant figures gives:\n-   $\\text{error} = 0.3393\\,\\mathrm{pu}$\n\n**Summary of Results**\nThe four requested quantities, rounded to four significant figures, are:\n-   Per-unit resistance $r = 0.02400$\n-   Per-unit reactance $x = 0.3600$\n-   Per-unit shunt susceptance $b = 0.3393$\n-   Per-unit reactive power error = $0.3393$\nThese are reported as a single row vector.",

The network is modeled for balanced three-phase alternating current (AC) using nodal admittances under steady-state sinusoidal conditions. The generator park comprises three internal buses, denoted $g_{1}$, $g_{2}$, and $g_{3}$, each connected to the transmission bus $t$ through a step-up transformer leakage branch with complex admittance $y_{ti}$, and each internal bus has a shunt admittance to ground $y_{si}$ representing the net generator stator and magnetizing admittance. Assume the external grid is not directly connected to bus $t$ for this calculation (so there is no additional shunt at $t$). The given admittances are:\n- $y_{t1} = -\\mathrm{j}\\,0.03~\\text{S}$, $y_{s1} = -\\mathrm{j}\\,0.06~\\text{S}$,\n- $y_{t2} = -\\mathrm{j}\\,0.025~\\text{S}$, $y_{s2} = -\\mathrm{j}\\,0.05~\\text{S}$,\n- $y_{t3} = -\\mathrm{j}\\,0.02~\\text{S}$, $y_{s3} = -\\mathrm{j}\\,0.04~\\text{S}$.\nStarting from Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL), the definition of nodal admittance matrices, and linear network equations $I = Y V$, derive the Kron reduction that eliminates the internal buses $\\{g_{1}, g_{2}, g_{3}\\}$ to obtain an equivalent one-port seen from the transmission bus $t$.

            "solution": "The first step is to construct the nodal admittance matrix ($Y_{\\text{bus}}$) for the network. The network has four buses: three internal generator buses $\\{g_1, g_2, g_3\\}$ and one transmission bus $t$.

The matrix equation is partitioned accordingly:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} I_G \\\\ I_T \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} Y_{GG} & Y_{GT} \\\\ Y_{TG} & Y_{TT} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} V_G \\\\ V_T \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $I_G = [I_{g_1}, I_{g_2}, I_{g_3}]^T$, $I_T = [I_t]$, $V_G = [V_{g_1}, V_{g_2}, V_{g_3}]^T$, and $V_T = [V_t]$.

In this problem, the internal buses $\\{g_1, g_2, g_3\\}$ of the generator park are eliminated. This procedure collapses the detailed internal structure of the generator park—comprising multiple generators and transformers with their specific admittances—into a single equivalent admittance, $Y_{\\text{eq}}$, as seen from the external transmission bus $t$. This equivalent admittance encapsulates the total contribution of the entire generator park to the network's behavior at bus $t$. For short-circuit analysis, $Y_{\\text{eq}}$ is the Thevenin equivalent admittance, which directly determines the fault current and thus the short-circuit strength. By performing Kron reduction, one isolates the net effect of the generator park, allowing a complex system to be represented by a simple, single-port equivalent circuit, which greatly simplifies the calculation of fault levels on the external grid.",

Substituting $\\theta_2 = 2\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_3 = \\theta_1$ into equation (2):\n$$-\\theta_1 + 3(2\\theta_1) - \\theta_1 = 1$$\n$$-\\theta_1 + 6\\theta_1 - \\theta_1 = 1$$\n$$4\\theta_1 = 1 \\implies \\theta_1 = \\frac{1}{4}$$\nTherefore, the angles are $\\theta_1^{\\text{closed}} = \\frac{1}{4}$, $\\theta_2^{\\text{closed}} = 2(\\frac{1}{4}) = \\frac{1}{2}$, and $\\theta_3^{\\text{closed}} = \\frac{1}{4}$. The slack bus angle is $\\theta_4 = 0$.\n\nThe flow on line $(1,2)$ is $f_{12}^{\\text{closed}} = b_{12}(\\theta_1^{\\text{closed}} - \\theta_2^{\\text{closed}})$.\n$$f_{12}^{\\text{closed}} = 1 \\left(\\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{4}$$\nSince this flow is due to a unit transaction ($P=1$), the PTDF is:\n$$\\text{PTDF}_{12}^{\\text{closed}} = \\frac{f_{12}^{\\text{closed}}}{P} = \\frac{-1/4}{1} = -\\frac{1}{4}$$\n\n**Part 2: Post-Contingency Network (Line $(2,4)$ Open)**\n\nThe branch $(2,4)$ is opened, so its susceptance becomes $b_{24}=0$. We recompute the reduced susceptance matrix, $B_{\\text{red}}^{\\text{open}}$.\n\nThe diagonal elements of $B_{\\text{red}}^{\\text{open}}$ are:\n- $B'_{11} = b_{12} + b_{14} = 1 + 1 = 2$\n- $B'_{22} = b_{21} + b_{23} = 1 + 1 = 2$  (This has changed from the \"closed\" case)\n- $B'_{33} = b_{32} + b_{34} = 1 + 1 = 2$\n\nThe off-diagonal elements are unchanged. The new reduced matrix is:\n$$B_{\\text{red}}^{\\text{open}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nThe injection vector $P_{\\text{red}}$ remains the same. We solve the new system $B_{\\text{red}}^{\\text{open}} \\theta_{\\text{red}}^{\\text{open}} = P_{\\text{red}}$:\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\theta_1 \\\\ \\theta_2 \\\\ \\theta_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThis corresponds to the new system of equations:\n1. $2\\theta_1 - \\theta_2 = 0 \\implies \\theta_2 = 2\\theta_1$\n2. $-\\theta_1 + 2\\theta_2 - \\theta_3 = 1$\n3. $-\\theta_2 + 2\\theta_3 = 0 \\implies \\theta_2 = 2\\theta_3$\n\nAgain, $\\theta_1 = \\theta_3$. Substituting $\\theta_2 = 2\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_3 = \\theta_1$ into the new equation (2):\n$$-\\theta_1 + 2(2\\theta_1) - \\theta_1 = 1$$\n$$-\\theta_1 + 4\\theta_1 - \\theta_1 = 1$$\n$$2\\theta_1 = 1 \\implies \\theta_1 = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThe new angles are $\\theta_1^{\\text{open}} = \\frac{1}{2}$, $\\theta_2^{\\text{open}} = 2(\\frac{1}{2}) = 1$, and $\\theta_3^{\\text{open}} = \\frac{1}{2}$. The slack bus angle is still $\\theta_4 = 0$.\n\nThe new flow on line $(1,2)$ is $f_{12}^{\\text{open}} = b_{12}(\\theta_1^{\\text{open}} - \\theta_2^{\\text{open}})$.\n$$f_{12}^{\\text{open}} = 1 \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - 1\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2}$$\nThe PTDF for the \"open\" case is:\n$$\\text{PTDF}_{12}^{\\text{open}} = \\frac{f_{12}^{\\text{open}}}{P} = \\frac{-1/2}{1} = -\\frac{1}{2}$$\n\n**Part 3: Change in PTDF**\n\nFinally, we compute the change in the PTDF for line $(1,2)$ as specified:\n$$\\Delta \\text{PTDF}_{12} = \\text{PTDF}_{12}^{\\text{open}} - \\text{PTDF}_{12}^{\\text{closed}}$$\n$$\\Delta \\text{PTDF}_{12} = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{4}\\right)$$\n$$\\Delta \\text{PTDF}_{12} = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = -\\frac{2}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = -\\frac{1}{4}$$\nThe analysis has been conducted from first principles as required, by explicitly forming and solving the nodal equations for both network configurations.",
