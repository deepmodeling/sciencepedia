All calculations are based on the provided data and the standard approximate equivalent circuit model of a single-phase transformer.\n\n**Task 1: Estimate the core-loss resistance $R_c$ and the series resistance $R$ at $25^{\\circ}\\text{C}$.**\n\nThe no-load test is used to determine the parameters of the shunt branch of the equivalent circuit. In this test, the applied voltage is the rated voltage, and the secondary is open. The input power, $P_0$, is almost entirely dissipated as heat in the transformer core, as the copper loss due to the small no-load current is negligible. This core loss is modeled by the shunt resistance $R_c$.\nGiven $P_0 = 120\\,\\text{W}$ at an applied voltage of $V_0 = 240\\,\\text{V}$, the core-loss resistance $R_c$ is found using the power formula $P = V^2/R$:\n$$P_0 = \\frac{V_0^2}{R_c}$$\n$$R_c = \\frac{V_0^2}{P_0} = \\frac{(240\\,\\text{V})^2}{120\\,\\text{W}} = \\frac{57600}{120}\\,\\Omega = 480\\,\\Omega$$\n\nThe short-circuit test is used to determine the parameters of the series branch. In this test, the secondary is short-circuited, and a reduced voltage is applied to the primary side to circulate the rated current. The input power, $P_{\\text{sc}}$, is almost entirely dissipated as copper loss in the windings, as the core loss at the low applied voltage is negligible. This copper loss is modeled by the series resistance $R$. The test is conducted at a reference temperature $T_{\\text{ref}} = 25^{\\circ}\\text{C}$.\nFirst, we calculate the rated current, which is the current used in the short-circuit test, $I_{\\text{sc}}$:\n$$I_{\\text{sc}} = I_{\\text{rated}} = \\frac{S_{\\text{rated}}}{V_{\\text{LV}}} = \\frac{10000\\,\\text{VA}}{240\\,\\text{V}} = \\frac{125}{3}\\,\\text{A}$$\nThe measured power $P_{\\text{sc}} = 350\\,\\text{W}$ is the copper loss at this current. The series resistance $R$ at the test temperature $T_{\\text{ref}}$ is found using the power formula $P = I^2R$:\n$$P_{\\text{sc}} = I_{\\text{sc}}^2 R(T_{\\text{ref}})$$\n$$R(25^{\\circ}\\text{C}) = \\frac{P_{\\text{sc}}}{I_{\\text{sc}}^2} = \\frac{350\\,\\text{W}}{(\\frac{125}{3}\\,\\text{A})^2} = \\frac{350}{\\frac{15625}{9}}\\,\\Omega = \\frac{350 \\times 9}{15625}\\,\\Omega = 0.2016\\,\\Omega$$\n\n**Task 2: Compute the copper loss $P_{\\text{cu}}$ at $75^{\\circ}\\text{C}$.**\n\nFirst, we determine the load current $I_L$ under the specified operating condition. The transformer delivers real power $P_L = 8.00\\,\\text{kW} = 8000\\,\\text{W}$ to a load at a terminal voltage $V = 240\\,\\text{V}$ and a power factor of 0.90.

In the approximate equivalent circuit, the current through the series resistance is the load current.\n$$P_{\\text{cu}} = I_L^2 R(75^{\\circ}\\text{C}) = \\left(\\frac{1000}{27}\\,\\text{A}\\right)^2 \\times (0.2412264\\,\\Omega)$$\n$$P_{\\text{cu}} \\approx (37.037...)^2 \\times 0.2412264\\,\\text{W} \\approx 1371.742... \\times 0.2412264\\,\\text{W} \\approx 330.8601\\,\\text{W}$$\n\n**Task 3: Compute the core loss $P_{\\text{core}}$ at the operating condition.**\n\nThe problem states to assume the terminal voltage is unchanged from the no-load test. The no-load test was performed at an applied voltage of $V_0 = 240\\,\\text{V}$, resulting in a measured core loss of $P_0 = 120\\,\\text{W}$. The operating condition specifies a load terminal voltage of $V = 240\\,\\text{V}$. The core loss is primarily a function of the voltage across the core and the frequency. Since both the voltage ($240\\,\\text{V}$) and frequency ($60\\,\\text{Hz}$) are the same as in the no-load test, and core loss is assumed insensitive to temperature, the core loss at the operating condition is the same as the power measured during the no-load test.\n$$P_{\\text{core}} = P_0 = 120\\,\\text{W}$$\n\n**Task 4: Compute the total loss $P_{\\text{loss,total}}$ at the operating condition.**\n\nThe total loss is the sum of the core loss and the copper loss at the operating condition.\n$$P_{\\text{loss,total}} = P_{\\text{core}} + P_{\\text{cu}}$$\n$$P_{\\text{loss,total}} = 120\\,\\text{W} + 330.8601\\,\\text{W} = 450.8601\\,\\text{W}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer in kilowatts ($\\text{kW}$), rounded to four significant figures.\n$$P_{\\text{loss,total}} = 0.4508601\\,\\text{kW}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$P_{\\text{loss,total}} \\approx 0.4509\\,\\text{kW}$$",

The loss for a single station is:\n$$P_{\\text{conv\\_station}} = a + b I_{\\text{dc}} = 8 \\text{ MW} + (0.004 \\text{ MW/A}) \\times (2500 \\text{ A}) = 8 \\text{ MW} + 10 \\text{ MW} = 18 \\text{ MW}$$\nThe total converter loss for both stations is:\n$$P_{\\ell,\\text{conv}} = 2 \\times P_{\\text{conv\\_station}} = 2 \\times 18 \\text{ MW} = 36 \\text{ MW}$$\n\nThe total real power loss for the HVDC alternative is the sum of these components:\n$$P_{\\ell,\\text{dc}} = P_{\\ell,\\text{cond}} + P_{\\ell,\\text{conv}} = 80 \\text{ MW} + 36 \\text{ MW} = 116 \\text{ MW}$$\n\n**Alternative B: AC System Analysis**\n\nThe AC system is a three-phase line operating at a receiving-end voltage of $V_{R, \\text{LL}} = 500$ kV (line-to-line, RMS) and delivering the same active power $P = 2500$ MW. The receiving-end power factor is specified as unity ($\\cos(\\theta_R) = 1$).\n\nFor a balanced three-phase system, the total active power is related to the line-to-line voltage $V_{\\text{LL}}$, the line current $I_L$, and the power factor $\\cos(\\theta)$ by:\n$$P = \\sqrt{3} V_{\\text{LL}} I_L \\cos(\\theta)$$\nUsing the receiving-end values, we can calculate the line current $I_L$:\n$$I_L = \\frac{P}{\\sqrt{3} V_{R, \\text{LL}} \\cos(\\theta_R)} = \\frac{2500 \\times 10^6 \\text{ W}}{\\sqrt{3} \\times (500 \\times 10^3 \\text{ V}) \\times 1} = \\frac{5000}{\\sqrt{3}} \\text{ A}$$\nThe problem states that due to ideal compensation, real power dissipation arises solely from the series resistance. The loss calculation is therefore based on the standard three-phase ohmic loss formula, $P_{\\ell,\\text{ac}} = 3 I_L^2 R_{\\text{ac\\_phase}}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total per-phase series resistance, $R_{\\text{ac\\_phase}}$, over the line length $L = 800$ km, using the given per-kilometer resistance $r = 0.012\\ \\Omega/\\text{km}$:\n$$R_{\\text{ac\\_phase}} = r \\times L = (0.012 \\text{ } \\Omega/\\text{km}) \\times (800 \\text{ km}) = 9.6 \\text{ } \\Omega$$\nNow, we calculate the total three-phase power loss:\n$$P_{\\ell,\\text{ac}} = 3 I_L^2 R_{\\text{ac\\_phase}} = 3 \\times \\left(\\frac{5000}{\\sqrt{3}} \\text{ A}\\right)^2 \\times (9.6 \\text{ } \\Omega) = 3 \\times \\frac{25 \\times 10^6}{3} \\text{ A}^2 \\times (9.6 \\text{ } \\Omega) = 240 \\times 10^6 \\text{ W} = 240 \\text{ MW}$$\nAlternatively, we can express the loss in terms of power and voltage to avoid intermediate rounding of the current:\n$$P_{\\ell,\\text{ac}} = 3 \\left(\\frac{P}{\\sqrt{3} V_{R, \\text{LL}}}\\right)^2 R_{\\text{ac\\_phase}} = \\frac{P^2 R_{\\text{ac\\_phase}}}{V_{R, \\text{LL}}^2} = \\frac{(2500 \\times 10^6 \\text{ W})^2 \\times (9.6 \\text{ } \\Omega)}{(500 \\times 10^3 \\text{ V})^2} = 240 \\times 10^6 \\text{ W} = 240 \\text{ MW}$$\n\n**Difference in Power Losses**\n\nThe problem asks for the difference $\\Delta P = P_{\\ell,\\text{dc}} - P_{\\ell,\\text{ac}}$.\n$$\\Delta P = 116 \\text{ MW} - 240 \\text{ MW} = -124 \\text{ MW}$$\nThe problem requests the final result rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value of $-124$ already contains three significant figures. The negative sign indicates that the AC transmission losses are greater than the HVDC transmission losses for this specific scenario.",
