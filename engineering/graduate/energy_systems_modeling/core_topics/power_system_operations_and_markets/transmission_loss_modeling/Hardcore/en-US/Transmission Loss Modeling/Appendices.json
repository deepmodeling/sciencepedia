The use of no-load (open-circuit) and short-circuit tests to determine circuit parameters is a standard, well-established laboratory procedure. The data provided are self-contained, internally consistent, and physically plausible for a transformer of the specified rating. The problem is well-posed, with a clear objective and a sufficient set of data and assumptions to arrive at a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution proceeds by following the four specified tasks. All calculations are based on the provided data and the standard approximate equivalent circuit model of a single-phase transformer.\n\n**Task 1: Estimate the core-loss resistance $R_c$ and the series resistance $R$ at $25^{\\circ}\\text{C}$.**\n\nThe no-load test is used to determine the parameters of the shunt branch of the equivalent circuit. In this test, the applied voltage is the rated voltage, and the secondary is open. The input power, $P_0$, is almost entirely dissipated as heat in the transformer core, as the copper loss due to the small no-load current is negligible. This core loss is modeled by the shunt resistance $R_c$.\nGiven $P_0 = 120\\,\\text{W}$ at an applied voltage of $V_0 = 240\\,\\text{V}$, the core-loss resistance $R_c$ is found using the power formula $P = V^2/R$:\n$$P_0 = \\frac{V_0^2}{R_c}$$\n$$R_c = \\frac{V_0^2}{P_0} = \\frac{(240\\,\\text{V})^2}{120\\,\\text{W}} = \\frac{57600}{120}\\,\\Omega = 480\\,\\Omega$$\n\nThe short-circuit test is used to determine the parameters of the series branch. In this test, the secondary is short-circuited, and a reduced voltage is applied to the primary side to circulate the rated current. The input power, $P_{\\text{sc}}$, is almost entirely dissipated as copper loss in the windings, as the core loss at the low applied voltage is negligible. This copper loss is modeled by the series resistance $R$. The test is conducted at a reference temperature $T_{\\text{ref}} = 25^{\\circ}\\text{C}$.\nFirst, we calculate the rated current, which is the current used in the short-circuit test, $I_{\\text{sc}}$:\n$$I_{\\text{sc}} = I_{\\text{rated}} = \\frac{S_{\\text{rated}}}{V_{\\text{LV}}} = \\frac{10000\\,\\text{VA}}{240\\,\\text{V}} = \\frac{125}{3}\\,\\text{A}$$\nThe measured power $P_{\\text{sc}} = 350\\,\\text{W}$ is the copper loss at this current. The series resistance $R$ at the test temperature $T_{\\text{ref}}$ is found using the power formula $P = I^2R$:\n$$P_{\\text{sc}} = I_{\\text{sc}}^2 R(T_{\\text{ref}})$$\n$$R(25^{\\circ}\\text{C}) = \\frac{P_{\\text{sc}}}{I_{\\text{sc}}^2} = \\frac{350\\,\\text{W}}{(\\frac{125}{3}\\,\\text{A})^2} = \\frac{350}{\\frac{15625}{9}}\\,\\Omega = \\frac{350 \\times 9}{15625}\\,\\Omega = 0.2016\\,\\Omega$$\n\n**Task 2: Compute the copper loss $P_{\\text{cu}}$ at $75^{\\circ}\\text{C}$.**\n\nFirst, we determine the load current $I_L$ under the specified operating condition. The transformer delivers real power $P_L = 8.00\\,\\text{kW} = 8000\\,\\text{W}$ to a load at a terminal voltage $V = 240\\,\\text{V}$ and a power factor $\\cos\\phi = 0.90$. The load current magnitude is given by $P_L = V I_L \\cos\\phi$:\n$$I_L = \\frac{P_L}{V \\cos\\phi} = \\frac{8000\\,\\text{W}}{240\\,\\text{V} \\times 0.90} = \\frac{8000}{216}\\,\\text{A} = \\frac{1000}{27}\\,\\text{A}$$\nNext, we adjust the series resistance for the operating temperature $T = 75^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ using the given linear temperature dependence formula:\n$$R(T) = R(T_{\\text{ref}})\\big[1 + \\alpha_{\\text{Cu}}(T - T_{\\text{ref}})\\big]$$\n$$R(75^{\\circ}\\text{C}) = R(25^{\\circ}\\text{C})\\big[1 + \\alpha_{\\text{Cu}}(75^{\\circ}\\text{C} - 25^{\\circ}\\text{C})\\big]$$\n$$R(75^{\\circ}\\text{C}) = (0.2016\\,\\Omega) \\times \\big[1 + (0.00393\\,\\text{K}^{-1})(50\\,\\text{K})\\big]$$\n$$R(75^{\\circ}\\text{C}) = 0.2016 \\times (1 + 0.1965) = 0.2016 \\times 1.1965\\,\\Omega = 0.2412264\\,\\Omega$$\nThe copper loss $P_{\\text{cu}}$ at the operating condition is the power dissipated in this resistance by the load current $I_L$. In the approximate equivalent circuit, the current through the series resistance is the load current.\n$$P_{\\text{cu}} = I_L^2 R(75^{\\circ}\\text{C}) = \\left(\\frac{1000}{27}\\,\\text{A}\\right)^2 \\times (0.2412264\\,\\Omega)$$\n$$P_{\\text{cu}} \\approx (37.037...)^2 \\times 0.2412264\\,\\text{W} \\approx 1371.742... \\times 0.2412264\\,\\text{W} \\approx 330.8601\\,\\text{W}$$\n\n**Task 3: Compute the core loss $P_{\\text{core}}$ at the operating condition.**\n\nThe problem states to assume the terminal voltage is unchanged from the no-load test. The no-load test was performed at an applied voltage of $V_0 = 240\\,\\text{V}$, resulting in a measured core loss of $P_0 = 120\\,\\text{W}$. The operating condition specifies a load terminal voltage of $V = 240\\,\\text{V}$. The core loss is primarily a function of the voltage across the core and the frequency. Since both the voltage ($240\\,\\text{V}$) and frequency ($60\\,\\text{Hz}$) are the same as in the no-load test, and core loss is assumed insensitive to temperature, the core loss at the operating condition is the same as the power measured during the no-load test.\n$$P_{\\text{core}} = P_0 = 120\\,\\text{W}$$\n\n**Task 4: Compute the total loss $P_{\\text{loss,total}}$ at the operating condition.**\n\nThe total loss is the sum of the core loss and the copper loss at the operating condition.\n$$P_{\\text{loss,total}} = P_{\\text{core}} + P_{\\text{cu}}$$\n$$P_{\\text{loss,total}} = 120\\,\\text{W} + 330.8601\\,\\text{W} = 450.8601\\,\\text{W}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer in kilowatts ($\\text{kW}$), rounded to four significant figures.\n$$P_{\\text{loss,total}} = 0.4508601\\,\\text{kW}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$P_{\\text{loss,total}} \\approx 0.4509\\,\\text{kW}$$",

The system is a balanced three-phase system, so calculations can be performed on a per-phase basis and then multiplied by $3$.\n\n**1. Conductor Heating Losses ($P_{\\text{cond}}$)**\nThe conductor loss is due to Joule heating. From Joule's first law, the power dissipated in a resistive element is $P = I^2 R$. For a three-phase system, the total conductor loss is the sum of the losses in each of the three conductors.\n$$P_{\\text{cond}} = 3 I^2 R_{\\text{AC}}$$\nHere, $I$ is the RMS phase current and $R_{\\text{AC}}$ is the alternating-current resistance of a single conductor over the length $L$.\n\nThe DC resistance, $R_{\\text{DC}}$, is first calculated at the conductor operating temperature, $T = 90^{\\circ}\\text{C}$.

Dielectric Losses ($P_{\\text{diel}}$)**\nDielectric loss occurs in the insulation material due to the time-varying electric field. We model the dielectric as a parallel equivalent circuit consisting of a pure capacitance $C$ and a shunt conductance $G$. The power dissipated is determined by the conductance and the applied voltage. The dissipation factor, $\\tan \\delta$, relates the conductance to the capacitance at a given angular frequency $\\omega = 2 \\pi f$.\nThe complex admittance per phase per unit length is $\\vec{Y}' = G' + j\\omega C'$, where $G'$ is the shunt conductance per unit length and $C'$ is the capacitance per unit length. The dissipation factor is defined as:\n$$\\tan \\delta = \\frac{G'}{\\omega C'}$$\nFrom this, we find the shunt conductance per unit length: $G' = \\omega C' \\tan \\delta$.\nThe power loss per phase per unit length is $P'_{\\text{diel, 1ph}} = V_{\\text{ph}}^2 G'$, where $V_{\\text{ph}}$ is the phase voltage. For a balanced system, $V_{\\text{ph}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{LL}}}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\nThe total dielectric loss for three phases over the length $L$ is:\n$$P_{\\text{diel}} = 3 \\times P'_{\\text{diel, 1ph}} \\times L = 3 (V_{\\text{ph}}^2 G' L) = 3 \\left(\\frac{V_{\\text{LL}}}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2 (\\omega C' \\tan \\delta) L = V_{\\text{LL}}^2 \\omega C' L \\tan \\delta$$\nSubstituting the given values (converting units to be consistent):\n$\\omega = 2 \\pi f = 2 \\pi (50 \\,\\text{Hz}) = 100\\pi \\,\\text{rad/s}$\n$C' = 0.20 \\,\\mu\\text{F}/\\text{km} = 0.20 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\text{F}/\\text{km}$\n$L = 12 \\,\\text{km}$\n$V_{\\text{LL}} = 220 \\,\\text{kV} = 220 \\times 10^3 \\,\\text{V}$\n$\\tan \\delta = 8.0 \\times 10^{-4}$\n$P_{\\text{diel}} = (220 \\times 10^3 \\,\\text{V})^2 \\times (100\\pi \\,\\text{rad/s}) \\times (0.20 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\text{F}/\\text{km}) \\times (12 \\,\\text{km}) \\times (8.0 \\times 10^{-4}) = 29194 \\,\\text{W}$\n\n**3. Sheath Circulating Current Losses ($P_{\\text{sheath}}$)**\nThe alternating magnetic field produced by the phase current induces a voltage along the length of the metallic sheath. Since the sheaths are solid-bonded at both ends, this voltage drives a circulating current through the loop formed by the sheath and the bonding connections. This current causes Joule heating in the sheath resistance.\nFrom Faraday's law of induction, the induced EMF per unit length, $\\vec{\\mathcal{E}}'$, is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux linkage, which is given by the mutual inductance per unit length, $m'$, and the phase current, $\\vec{I}$. In phasor form:\n$$\\vec{\\mathcal{E}}' = -j\\omega (m' \\vec{I})$$\nThe magnitude of this induced voltage per unit length is $\\mathcal{E}' = \\omega m' I$.\nThis voltage drives a current, $\\vec{I}_s$, through the sheath's own impedance per unit length, $\\vec{z}_s' = r_s' + j\\omega l_s'$. According to the problem's model, $\\vec{I}_s = \\vec{\\mathcal{E}}' / \\vec{z}_s'$.\nThe magnitude of the sheath current is:\n$$I_s = |\\vec{I}_s| = \\frac{\\mathcal{E}'}{|\\vec{z}_s'|} = \\frac{\\omega m' I}{\\sqrt{(r_s')^2 + (\\omega l_s')^2}}$$\nThe power loss is due to this current flowing through the sheath's resistance, $r_s'$. The loss per phase per unit length is $P'_{\\text{sheath, 1ph}} = I_s^2 r_s'$.\nThe total sheath loss for three phases over the length $L$ is:\n$$P_{\\text{sheath}} = 3 \\times P'_{\\text{sheath, 1ph}} \\times L = 3 I_s^2 r_s' L = 3 \\left( \\frac{(\\omega m' I)^2}{(r_s')^2 + (\\omega l_s')^2} \\right) r_s' L$$\nWe use per-kilometer units for calculation convenience:\n$r_s' = 0.25 \\,\\Omega/\\text{km}$\n$l_s' = 0.90 \\,\\text{mH}/\\text{km} = 0.90 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\text{H}/\\text{km}$\n$m' = 0.35 \\,\\text{mH}/\\text{km} = 0.35 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\text{H}/\\text{km}$\nSheath reactance per unit length: $\\omega l_s' = (100\\pi \\,\\text{rad/s}) \\times (0.90 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\text{H}/\\text{km}) = 0.28274 \\,\\Omega/\\text{km}$\nMutual reactance per unit length: $\\omega m' = (100\\pi \\,\\text{rad/s}) \\times (0.35 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\text{H}/\\text{km}) = 0.10996 \\,\\Omega/\\text{km}$\nMagnitude of sheath current:\n$I_s = \\frac{(0.10996 \\,\\Omega/\\text{km}) \\times (420 \\,\\text{A})}{\\sqrt{(0.25 \\,\\Omega/\\text{km})^2 + (0.28274 \\,\\Omega/\\text{km})^2}} = \\frac{46.183 \\,\\text{A}\\cdot\\Omega/\\text{km}}{0.37741 \\,\\Omega/\\text{km}} = 122.37 \\,\\text{A}$\nThe total sheath loss is:\n$P_{\\text{sheath}} = 3 \\times (122.37 \\,\\text{A})^2 \\times (0.25 \\,\\Omega/\\text{km}) \\times (12 \\,\\text{km}) = 134752 \\,\\text{W}$\n\n**4.

Assume there is no reactive compensation at the receiving bus other than the line's own shunt pathway.\n\nYour program must implement the above derivations and produce numerical results for the following test suite of parameter sets, each describing one scenario:\n- Case 1 (typical high-voltage line): $r = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega/km}$, $x = 0.35\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega/km}$, $b = 3\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{S/km}$, $|V_{\\text{R,line}}| = 230\\,\\mathrm{kV}$, $P_{\\text{R,tot}} = 200\\,\\mathrm{MW}$, $\\cos(\\phi_{\\text{R}}) = 0.95$.\n- Case 2 (boundary with negligible shunt): $r = 0.08\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega/km}$, $x = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega/km}$, $b = 0\\,\\mathrm{S/km}$, $|V_{\\text{R,line}}| = 115\\,\\mathrm{kV}$, $P_{\\text{R,tot}} = 50\\,\\mathrm{MW}$, $\\cos(\\phi_{\\text{R}}) = 0.90$.\n- Case 3 (extra-high voltage and heavy transfer): $r = 0.03\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega/km}$, $x = 0.32\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega/km}$, $b = 4\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{S/km}$, $|V_{\\text{R,line}}| = 500\\,\\mathrm{kV}$, $P_{\\text{R,tot}} = 800\\,\\mathrm{MW}$, $\\cos(\\phi_{\\text{R}}) = 0.97$.\n- Case 4 (high reactance, significant shunt): $r = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega/km}$, $x = 0.60\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega/km}$, $b = 6\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{S/km}$, $|V_{\\text{R,line}}| = 400\\,\\mathrm{kV}$, $P_{\\text{R,tot}} = 600\\,\\mathrm{MW}$, $\\cos(\\phi_{\\text{R}}) = 0.85$.\n\nIn every case, take the line length as $\\ell = 100\\,\\mathrm{km}$. Use $j$ for the imaginary unit. Convert all voltages to $\\mathrm{V}$ and powers to $\\mathrm{W}$ internally, and express the final losses in $\\mathrm{MW}$ as decimal numbers.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, ordered as:\n$[P_{\\text{loss},\\pi}^{(1)}, P_{\\text{loss},\\text{exact}}^{(1)}, P_{\\text{loss},\\pi}^{(2)}, P_{\\text{loss},\\text{exact}}^{(2)}, P_{\\text{loss},\\pi}^{(3)}, P_{\\text{loss},\\text{exact}}^{(3)}, P_{\\text{loss},\\pi}^{(4)}, P_{\\text{loss},\\text{exact}}^{(4)}]$,\nwhere each entry is a float representing the loss in $\\mathrm{MW}$ for that case and model.\n\nEnsure numerical stability at the boundary $b = 0$ by correctly handling the limit of the exact distributed-parameter model when the shunt admittance per unit length is zero. The final answers must be expressed in $\\mathrm{MW}$ as decimal numbers.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of total three-phase active power loss in a uniform AC transmission line using two different models: the exact distributed-parameter model and the lumped $\\pi$-equivalent model. The solution requires deriving the equations governing each model and then applying them to a set of numerical test cases. The analysis is performed in steady-state using phasors.\n\n### 1. Per-Phase Equivalent Circuit Analysis\nFor a balanced three-phase system, analysis can be simplified by considering a per-phase equivalent circuit. The balanced three-phase quantities are related to per-phase quantities (denoted by subscript `ph`) as follows:\n- Line-to-neutral (phase) voltage magnitude: $|V_{\\text{ph}}| = |V_{\\text{line}}| / \\sqrt{3}$\n- Per-phase power: $P_{\\text{ph}} = P_{\\text{tot}} / 3$\n\nWe are given the receiving-end line-to-line voltage magnitude $|V_{\\text{R,line}}|$, total three-phase real power $P_{\\text{R,tot}}$, and lagging power factor $\\cos(\\phi_{\\text{R}})$. We establish the receiving-end phase voltage phasor $V_{\\text{R}}$ as the reference:\n$$V_{\\text{R}} = \\frac{|V_{\\text{R,line}}|}{\\sqrt{3}} \\angle 0^\\circ = \\frac{|V_{\\text{R,line}}|}{\\sqrt{3}} + j0$$\nThe per-phase real power at the receiving end is $P_{\\text{R,ph}} = P_{\\text{R,tot}} / 3$. For a lagging power factor $\\cos(\\phi_{\\text{R}})$, the current lags the voltage by an angle $\\phi_{\\text{R}} = \\arccos(\\cos(\\phi_{\\text{R}}))$. The per-phase reactive power is $Q_{\\text{R,ph}} = P_{\\text{R,ph}} \\tan(\\phi_{\\text{R}})$.\nThe per-phase complex power at the receiving end is:\n$$S_{\\text{R,ph}} = P_{\\text{R,ph}} + jQ_{\\text{R,ph}}$$\nThe per-phase complex power is also given by $S_{\\text{R,ph}} = V_{\\text{R}} I_{\\text{R}}^*$, where $I_{\\text{R}}^*$ is the complex conjugate of the receiving-end current phasor. The receiving-end current phasor $I_{\\text{R}}$ can be calculated as:\n$$I_{\\text{R}} = \\left(\\frac{S_{\\text{R,ph}}}{V_{\\text{R}}}\\right)^* = \\frac{S_{\\text{R,ph}}^*}{V_{\\text{R}}^*} = \\frac{P_{\\text{R,ph}} - jQ_{\\text{R,ph}}}{V_{\\text{R}}}$$\nsince $V_{\\text{R}}$ is purely real.\n\nThe line is characterized by its per-unit-length parameters: series resistance $r$, series reactance $x$, and shunt susceptance $b$. The series impedance per unit length is $z' = r + jx$ ($\\mathrm{\\Omega/km}$), and the shunt admittance per unit length is $y' = jb$ ($\\mathrm{S/km}$). The total line length is $\\ell$.\n\n### 2. The Exact Distributed-Parameter Model\nThis model originates from the Telegrapher's equations, which describe voltage and current along the line. For a uniform line in sinusoidal steady state, these are:\n$$\\frac{dV(z)}{dz} = z' I(z)$$\n$$\\frac{dI(z)}{dz} = y' V(z)$$\nwhere $z$ is the distance from the sending end. Solving this system of coupled differential equations yields the relationship between sending-end quantities ($V_{\\text{S}}, I_{\\text{S}}$) and receiving-end quantities ($V_{\\text{R}}, I_{\\text{R}}$):\n$$V_{\\text{S}} = V_{\\text{R}} \\cosh(\\gamma \\ell) + I_{\\text{R}} Z_c \\sinh(\\gamma \\ell)$$\n$$I_{\\text{S}} = V_{\\text{R}} \\frac{1}{Z_c} \\sinh(\\gamma \\ell) + I_{\\text{R}} \\cosh(\\gamma \\ell)$$\nHere, $\\gamma = \\sqrt{z' y'}$ is the propagation constant and $Z_c = \\sqrt{z'/y'}$ is the characteristic impedance. These equations define the two-port ABCD parameters for the exact model:\n$$A_{\\text{exact}} = D_{\\text{exact}} = \\cosh(\\gamma \\ell)$$\n$$B_{\\text{exact}} = Z_c \\sinh(\\gamma \\ell)$$\n$$C_{\\text{exact}} = \\frac{1}{Z_c} \\sinh(\\gamma \\ell)$$\n\nA special case arises when the shunt susceptance $b=0$, which implies $y'=0$. This leads to $\\gamma=0$ and an undefined $Z_c$. We must evaluate the limits of the parameters as $\\gamma \\to 0$:\n- $\\lim_{\\gamma \\to 0} \\cosh(\\gamma \\ell) = 1$\n- $\\lim_{\\gamma \\to 0} Z_c \\sinh(\\gamma \\ell) = \\lim_{\\gamma \\to 0} \\sqrt{\\frac{z'}{y'}} \\sinh(\\ell\\sqrt{z'y'}) = z' \\ell$\n- $\\lim_{\\gamma \\to 0} \\frac{1}{Z_c} \\sinh(\\gamma \\ell) = \\lim_{\\gamma \\to 0} \\sqrt{\\frac{y'}{z'}} \\sinh(\\ell\\sqrt{z'y'}) = y' \\ell = 0$\nThus, for $b=0$, the relations become:\n$$V_{\\text{S}} = V_{\\text{R}} + (z' \\ell) I_{\\text{R}}$$\n$$I_{\\text{S}} = I_{\\text{R}}$$\nThis is the short-line model, where the line is represented only by its total series impedance $Z = z' \\ell$.\n\n### 3. The Lumped $\\pi$-Equivalent Model\nThis model approximates the distributed nature of the line by lumping the total series impedance into one component and splitting the total shunt admittance into two equal parts at each end of the line.\n- Total series impedance: $Z = z' \\ell$\n- Total shunt admittance: $Y = y' \\ell$\n\nThe circuit consists of a shunt admittance $Y/2$ at the sending end, the series impedance $Z$, and another shunt admittance $Y/2$ at the receiving end.\nThe current through the receiving-end shunt is $I_{\\text{sh,R}} = V_{\\text{R}} (Y/2)$.\nBy Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at the receiving-end node, the current in the series impedance is $I_{\\text{L}} = I_{\\text{R}} + I_{\\text{sh,R}} = I_{\\text{R}} + V_{\\text{R}}(Y/2)$.\nBy Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) along the line, the sending-end voltage is:\n$$V_{\\text{S}, \\pi} = V_{\\text{R}} + I_{\\text{L}} Z = V_{\\text{R}} + (I_{\\text{R}} + V_{\\text{R}}\\frac{Y}{2})Z = V_{\\text{R}}(1 + \\frac{ZY}{2}) + I_{\\text{R}}Z$$\nThe current through the sending-end shunt is $I_{\\text{sh,S}} = V_{\\text{S}, \\pi} (Y/2)$.\nBy KCL at the sending-end node, the sending-end current is:\n$$I_{\\text{S}, \\pi} = I_{\\text{L}} + I_{\\text{sh,S}} = (I_{\\text{R}} + V_{\\text{R}}\\frac{Y}{2}) + V_{\\text{S}, \\pi}\\frac{Y}{2}$$\nIf $b=0$, then $Y=0$, and the $\\pi$-model also reduces to the short-line model: $V_{\\text{S}} = V_{\\text{R}} + Z I_{\\text{R}}$ and $I_{\\text{S}} = I_{\\text{R}}$.\n\n### 4. Power Loss Calculation\nFor both models, once the sending-end voltage $V_{\\text{S}}$ and current $I_{\\text{S}}$ phasors are determined, the per-phase complex power at the sending end is calculated as:\n$$S_{\\text{S,ph}} = V_{\\text{S}} I_{\\text{S}}^*$$\nThe per-phase real power at the sending end is its real part:\n$$P_{\\text{S,ph}} = \\text{Re}(S_{\\text{S,ph}})$$\nThe total three-phase real power at the sending end is $P_{\\text{S,tot}} = 3 \\times P_{\\text{S,ph}}$.\nThe total three-phase active power loss in the line is the difference between the sending-end and receiving-end real power:\n$$P_{\\text{loss}} = P_{\\text{S,tot}} - P_{\\text{R,tot}}$$\nThis procedure is applied for both the exact and the $\\pi$ models to find $P_{\\text{loss,exact}}$ and $P_{\\text{loss},\\pi}$ respectively. All final loss values are reported in megawatts ($\\mathrm{MW}$).",
