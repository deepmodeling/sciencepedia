            "problem": "A river reach hosts a cascaded pair of hydroelectric power plants (Hydroelectric Power Plant (HPP) units) operating in steady state. The upstream HPP releases a constant discharge that immediately forms the inflow to the downstream HPP through a short reach with negligible storage, so the volumetric flow rate through the downstream turbine can be treated as steady and equal to the upstream release. The downstream HPP is designed so that the gross head is reduced by internal losses in the conveyance system and by tailrace submergence effects; the resulting effective net head across the turbine-generator is measured as the difference in piezometric head between the intake and the draft tube outlet. Assume the working fluid is water, which can be modeled as incompressible, and that all unsteady and kinetic energy terms at the reservoir surfaces are negligible relative to the head difference. The combined electro-mechanical efficiency of the downstream unit aggregates turbine and generator losses into a single constant factor.\n\nUsing a control-volume argument based on the conservation of mass and the mechanical energy balance for incompressible flow, derive the expression for the electrical power output of the downstream unit in terms of the fluid density, gravitational acceleration, volumetric flow rate, net head, and the combined efficiency. Then evaluate the power for the downstream HPP for the following scientifically consistent parameters: fluid density $\\rho = 1000\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}$, gravitational acceleration $\\,g = 9.81\\,\\mathrm{m/s^{2}}$, volumetric flow rate $\\,Q = 250\\,\\mathrm{m^{3}/s}$, net head $\\,H = 80\\,\\mathrm{m}$, and combined efficiency $\\,\\eta = 0.92$.\n\nExpress the final power in megawatts (MW) and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The derivation of the electrical power output of the hydroelectric power plant is based on the steady-flow energy equation, an expression of the conservation of energy for an open system (a control volume).\n\nWe define a control volume enclosing the water path through the turbine-generator unit. Power is the rate at which energy is transferred. The hydraulic power available, $P_h$, is the rate of potential energy change of the water flowing through the system. The potential energy of a mass $m$ of water at height $H$ is $m g H$. The power is this energy transferred per unit time. For a mass flow rate $\\dot{m}$, the power is $\\dot{m} g H$.\n\nThe mass flow rate $\\dot{m}$ is the product of the fluid density $\\rho$ and the volumetric flow rate $Q$:\n$$\n\\dot{m} = \\rho Q\n$$\nTherefore, the hydraulic power transferred from the water to the turbine runner is:\n$$\nP_h = \\dot{m} g H = \\rho g Q H\n$$\nIn this equation, $H$ is the net head, which represents the effective energy head available to the turbine after all hydraulic losses in the conveyance system are accounted for.\n\nThe conversion of this mechanical power to electrical power is not perfectly efficient. The problem provides a combined electro-mechanical efficiency, $\\eta$, which accounts for all losses in the turbine and the generator. The final electrical power output, $P_{elec}$, is the hydraulic power multiplied by this efficiency factor:\n$$\nP_{elec} = \\eta P_h\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P_h$, we arrive at the desired formula:\n$$\nP_{elec} = \\eta \\rho g Q H\n$$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression using the provided numerical parameters:\n- $\\eta = 0.92$\n- $\\rho = 1000\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}$\n- $g = 9.81\\,\\mathrm{m/s^{2}}$\n- $Q = 250\\,\\mathrm{m^{3}/s}$\n- $H = 80\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the power equation:\n$$\nP_{elec} = (0.92) \\times (1000\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}) \\times (9.81\\,\\mathrm{m/s^{2}}) \\times (250\\,\\mathrm{m^{3}/s}) \\times (80\\,\\mathrm{m})\n$$\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n$$\nP_{elec} = 0.92 \\times 1000 \\times 9.81 \\times 250 \\times 80\n$$\n$$\nP_{elec} = 180,504,000\\,\\mathrm{W}\n$$\nThe unit of the result is Watts, as can be verified by dimensional analysis:\n$$[\\mathrm{kg/m^3}] \\times [\\mathrm{m/s^2}] \\times [\\mathrm{m^3/s}] \\times [\\mathrm{m}] = [\\mathrm{kg \\cdot m/s^2}] \\times [\\mathrm{m/s}] = [\\mathrm{N} \\cdot \\mathrm{m/s}] = [\\mathrm{J/s}] = [\\mathrm{W}]$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be in megawatts ($\\mathrm{MW}$) and rounded to four significant figures.

            "problem": "Consider an upstream reservoir in a two-reservoir cascade used for hydropower. The upstream reservoir receives exogenous river inflow and discharges a controlled release to the downstream reservoir. Over a control interval of length $\\Delta t$, assume that all boundary flows can be approximated as piecewise constant. Neglect precipitation on the reservoir surface, infiltration, and seepage. Treat evaporation as a known volumetric outflow rate equal to the product of an observed evaporation flux and the surface area, already aggregated into a volumetric rate.\n\nLet $S_t$ denote the storage at time $t$, $I_t$ the external inflow to the reservoir, $R_t$ the turbine release to the downstream reservoir, $\\mathrm{Sp}_t$ the spill (if any) over the spillway, and $\\mathrm{Ev}_t$ the volumetric evaporation rate from the reservoir surface.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the discrete-time mass balance equation for a reservoir and its application to compute the storage at the next time step. The fundamental principle governing this system is the conservation of mass.\n\nLet $S(t')$ represent the volume of water (storage) in the reservoir at a continuous time $t'$. Assuming the density of water is constant, the conservation of mass is equivalent to the conservation of volume. The time rate of change of the storage volume is equal to the total volumetric inflow rate minus the total volumetric outflow rate. This relationship can be expressed as a differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dS(t')}{dt'} = Q_{\\text{in}}(t') - Q_{\\text{out}}(t')\n$$\nwhere $Q_{\\text{in}}(t')$ is the total inflow rate and $Q_{\\text{out}}(t')$ is the total outflow rate at time $t'$.\n\nFrom the problem statement, the total inflow is the exogenous river inflow, which we can denote as $I(t')$. The total outflow is the sum of the turbine release $R(t')$, the spill $\\mathrm{Sp}(t')$, and the evaporation $\\mathrm{Ev}(t')$. Thus, the differential equation for the reservoir storage becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dS(t')}{dt'} = I(t') - \\left(R(t') + \\mathrm{Sp}(t') + \\mathrm{Ev}(t')\\right)\n$$\nTo obtain the discrete-time balance equation over a time interval of length $\\Delta t$, we integrate this equation from an initial time $t$ to a final time $t+\\Delta t$:\n$$\n\\int_{t}^{t+\\Delta t} \\frac{dS(t')}{dt'} dt' = \\int_{t}^{t+\\Delta t} \\left( I(t') - R(t') - \\mathrm{Sp}(t') - \\mathrm{Ev}(t') \\right) dt'\n$$\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the left-hand side evaluates to $S(t+\\Delta t) - S(t)$. We adopt the notation from the problem, where $S_t$ denotes the storage at the beginning of the interval (i.e., $S(t)$) and $S_{t+1}$ denotes the storage at the end of the interval (i.e., $S(t+\\Delta t)$). The change in storage is therefore $S_{t+1} - S_t$.\n\nThe problem states that all boundary flows can be approximated as piecewise constant over the control interval $\\Delta t$. This implies that for the duration of the interval from $t$ to $t+\\Delta t$, the flow rates $I(t')$, $R(t')$, $\\mathrm{Sp}(t')$, and $\\mathrm{Ev}(t')$ are constant and equal to the values given for that interval, which are denoted as $I_t$, $R_t$, $\\mathrm{Sp}_t$, and $\\mathrm{Ev}_t$, respectively. With this simplifying assumption, the integrand on the right-hand side is constant and can be moved outside the integral:\n$$\nS_{t+1} - S_t = (I_t - R_t - \\mathrm{Sp}_t - \\mathrm{Ev}_t) \\int_{t}^{t+\\Delta t} dt'\n$$\nThe remaining integral evaluates to the length of the time interval, $(t+\\Delta t) - t = \\Delta t$:\n$$\nS_{t+1} - S_t = (I_t - R_t - \\mathrm{Sp}_t - \\mathrm{Ev}_t) \\Delta t\n$$\nRearranging to solve for the storage at the next time step, $S_{t+1}$, we arrive at the required discrete-time storage balance equation:\n$$\nS_{t+1} = S_t + (I_t - R_t - \\mathrm{Sp}_t - \\mathrm{Ev}_t) \\Delta t\n$$\nThis completes the derivation.

This change is the product of the net flow rate and the duration of the interval:\n$$\n\\Delta S = \\left(18\\,\\mathrm{\\frac{m^3}{s}}\\right) \\times (86400\\,\\mathrm{s})\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta S = 1,555,200\\,\\mathrm{m^3}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the storage at the end of the interval, $S_{t+1}$, by adding the change in storage to the initial storage:\n$$\nS_{t+1} = S_t + \\Delta S = 10^7\\,\\mathrm{m^3} + 1,555,200\\,\\mathrm{m^3}\n$$\n$$\nS_{t+1} = 10,000,000\\,\\mathrm{m^3} + 1,555,200\\,\\mathrm{m^3} = 11,555,200\\,\\mathrm{m^3}\n$$\nThe calculation is exact, and no rounding is necessary.
