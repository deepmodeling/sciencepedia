The rate of heat transfer, $Q$, from the hot fluid to the cold fluid is given by:\n$$Q = \\dot{m}_{h} c_{p,h} (T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{h,\\mathrm{out}}) = \\dot{m}_{c} c_{p,c} (T_{c,\\mathrm{out}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}})$$\nIt is convenient to work with the heat capacity rates, $C$, for each stream:\n$$C_h = \\dot{m}_{h} c_{p,h} = (60\\ \\mathrm{kg/s}) \\times (4.3\\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{J/(kg\\cdot K)}) = 2.58 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{W/K}$$\n$$C_c = \\dot{m}_{c} c_{p,c} = (40\\ \\mathrm{kg/s}) \\times (3.8\\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{J/(kg\\cdot K)}) = 1.52 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{W/K}$$\nThe energy balance equation can be rewritten as:\n$$Q = C_h (T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{h,\\mathrm{out}}) = C_c (T_{c,\\mathrm{out}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}})$$\nSince $C_c < C_h$, the cold fluid has the minimum heat capacity rate ($C_c = C_{\\min}$).\n\nThe maximum feasible heat transfer, $Q_{\\max}$, is limited by two constraints. We will analyze each constraint to determine which is the limiting factor.\n\n**Case 1: Reinjection Temperature Constraint**\nThis constraint sets a lower bound on the hot fluid outlet temperature: $T_{h,\\mathrm{out}} \\ge T_{h,\\mathrm{out},\\min} = 90\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. The maximum heat transfer under this constraint, $Q_1$, occurs when $T_{h,\\mathrm{out}}$ is at its minimum allowed value.\n$$Q_1 = C_h (T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{h,\\mathrm{out},\\min}) = (2.58 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{W/K}) \\times (150\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} - 90\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$$\n$$Q_1 = (2.58 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{W/K}) \\times (60\\ \\mathrm{K}) = 15.48 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{W} = 15.48\\ \\mathrm{MW}$$\nWe must verify if this operating point violates the pinch constraint. First, we find the corresponding cold fluid outlet temperature, $T_{c,\\mathrm{out},1}$:\n$$T_{c,\\mathrm{out},1} = T_{c,\\mathrm{in}} + \\frac{Q_1}{C_c} = 30\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} + \\frac{15.48 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{W}}{1.52 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{W/K}} \\approx 30 + 101.842\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} = 131.842\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$$\nFor a counter-current exchanger, the temperature differences at the two ends are:\n-   At the hot fluid inlet / cold fluid outlet: $\\Delta T_1 = T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{out},1} = 150\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} - 131.842\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} = 18.158\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\n-   At the hot fluid outlet / cold fluid inlet: $\\Delta T_2 = T_{h,\\mathrm{out},\\min} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}} = 90\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} - 30\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} = 60\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\nThe minimum temperature difference in this case is $\\min(\\Delta T_1, \\Delta T_2) = 18.158\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. Since $18.158\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} > \\Delta T_{\\min} = 10\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, this is a feasible operating point.\n\n**Case 2: Pinch Point Constraint**\nThis constraint requires the temperature difference between the hot and cold fluids to be at least $\\Delta T_{\\min} = 10\\ \\mathrm{K}$ everywhere. For a counter-current heat exchanger, the pinch point (minimum temperature difference) occurs at one of the two ends. Since $C_c  C_h$, the temperature of the cold fluid increases more per unit of heat exchanged than the temperature of the hot fluid decreases. Therefore, the temperature profiles are closest at the hot end of the exchanger (where the cold fluid exits). The pinch constraint is thus $T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{out}} \\ge \\Delta T_{\\min}$.\n\nThe maximum heat transfer under this constraint, $Q_2$, would occur if the cold fluid outlet temperature reached its maximum possible value, $T_{c,\\mathrm{out},2} = T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - \\Delta T_{\\min} = 150\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} - 10\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} = 140\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. The corresponding heat transfer would be:\n$$Q_2 = C_c (T_{c,\\mathrm{out},2} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}) = (1.52 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{W/K}) \\times (140\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} - 30\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) = 1.672 \\times 10^7\\ \\mathrm{W} = 16.72\\ \\mathrm{MW}$$\nWe must check if this operating point is compatible with the reinjection constraint. The required hot fluid outlet temperature would be:\n$$T_{h,\\mathrm{out},2} = T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - \\frac{Q_2}{C_h} = 150\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} - \\frac{16.72 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{W}}{2.58 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{W/K}} \\approx 150 - 64.81 = 85.19\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$$\nThis temperature is below the minimum reinjection temperature of $90\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. Therefore, the pinch constraint is not the limiting factor; it is impossible to reach the pinch limit without first violating the reinjection temperature constraint.\n\n**Conclusion on Limiting Constraint and $Q_{\\max}$**\nThe analysis shows that the system is limited by the reinjection temperature requirement, not the pinch point. The maximum feasible heat recovery rate is the one determined in Case 1.\n$$Q_{\\max} = Q_1 = 15.48\\ \\mathrm{MW}$$\n\n**Assessment of Pinch Constraint and LMTD Calculation**\nAt the maximum heat recovery rate of $Q_{\\max} = 15.48\\ \\mathrm{MW}$, the minimum temperature difference is $18.158\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, which is greater than the required minimum of $10\\ \\mathrm{K}$. Thus, the **pinch constraint is not active**. The reinjection temperature constraint is the active constraint.\n\nThe log-mean temperature difference (LMTD) is calculated using the temperature differences at the ends of the exchanger for the actual operating conditions:\n$\\Delta T_1 = 18.158\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\n$\\Delta T_2 = 60\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\n$$\\text{LMTD} = \\frac{\\Delta T_2 - \\Delta T_1}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\Delta T_2}{\\Delta T_1}\\right)} = \\frac{60 - 18.158}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{60}{18.158}\\right)} = \\frac{41.842}{\\ln(3.3043...)} \\approx \\frac{41.842}{1.1951} \\approx 35.01\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$$\nThe problem asks for the single value of $Q_{\\max}$ in $\\mathrm{MW}$, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$Q_{\\max} = 15.48\\ \\mathrm{MW}$$\nThe value is already at four significant figures.",

Gaussian noise $\\epsilon_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$:\n$$\nd_i = \\Delta p(t_i; k_{\\text{true}}) + \\epsilon_i\n$$\n\nTo solve the inverse problem, we use a linearized approach. The forward model is approximated by its first-order Taylor expansion around an initial guess $k_0$:\n$$\n\\Delta p(t_i; k) \\approx \\Delta p(t_i; k_0) + g_i\\,(k - k_0)\n$$\nThe term $g_i$ is the sensitivity, or the partial derivative of the pressure response with respect to permeability, evaluated at $k_0$:\n$$\ng_i = \\left.\\frac{\\partial \\Delta p(t_i; k)}{\\partial k}\\right|_{k=k_0} = \\frac{A}{k_0^2}\\left(1 - \\ln\\!\\big(C\\,k_0\\,t_i\\big)\\right)\n$$\nWith this linearization, the estimated permeability $\\hat{k}$ is found by minimizing the weighted sum of squared residuals. For i.i.d. Gaussian noise, this yields the linearized least squares estimator:\n$$\n\\hat{k} = k_0 + \\frac{\\sum_{i} g_i\\left(d_i - \\Delta p(t_i; k_0)\\right)}{\\sum_{i} g_i^2}\n$$\nNote that the weighting factors $1/\\sigma^2$ cancel from the numerator and denominator in this single-parameter Gauss-Newton update step.\n\nThe uncertainty in this estimate is quantified using the Cramér–Rao Lower Bound (CRLB), which provides a lower bound on the variance of any unbiased estimator. The CRLB is the inverse of the Fisher Information, $\\mathcal{I}(k_0)$. For a single parameter and i.i.d. Gaussian noise, the Fisher Information is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{I}(k_0) = \\sum_{i} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sigma} \\frac{\\partial \\Delta p(t_i; k_0)}{\\partial k}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i} g_i^2\n$$\nThe CRLB for the variance is $\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{k}) \\ge 1/\\mathcal{I}(k_0)$. We are tasked to compute the standard deviation bound, which is the square root of this value:\n$$\n\\text{CRLB Standard Deviation Bound} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\mathcal{I}(k_0)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sum_{i} g_i^2}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i} g_i^2}}\n$$\n\nThe algorithm for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Given the physical parameters ($q, \\mu, h, c_t, r_w$), compute the constants $A$ and $C$.\n2.  Generate the array of measurement times $\\{t_i\\}$ for the specified number of points and time interval using a logarithmic scale.\n3.  Calculate the \"true\" pressure response $\\Delta p(t_i; k_{\\text{true}})$.\n4.  Generate a vector of random noise $\\epsilon_i$ from $\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$ using a fixed random seed for reproducibility, and add it to the true pressures to obtain the synthetic data vector $\\{d_i\\}$.\n5.  Calculate the modeled pressure response at the initial guess, $\\Delta p(t_i; k_0)$.\n6.  Calculate the sensitivity vector $\\{g_i\\}$.\n7.  Use the derived formulas to compute the estimated permeability $\\hat{k}$ and the CRLB standard deviation bound.\n8.  Collect and format the results as specified.\n\nThis procedure will be implemented in a Python script using the `numpy` library for efficient numerical computations.",
