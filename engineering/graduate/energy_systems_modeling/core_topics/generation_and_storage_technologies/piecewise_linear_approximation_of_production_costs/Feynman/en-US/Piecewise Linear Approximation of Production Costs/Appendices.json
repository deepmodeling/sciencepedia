Convex cost functions and their piecewise linear approximations are fundamental tools for modeling thermal generator dispatch.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-defined. It provides all necessary information and asks for a specific derivation and a calculation. The given data is consistent; the cost is an increasing function of power ($5000 < 7000 < 9500$ for $50 < 75 < 100$). The discrete points also exhibit convexity, as the slope of the segment from $p=50$ to $p=75$ is $\\frac{7000-5000}{75-50} = \\frac{2000}{25} = 80$, and the slope of the segment from $p=75$ to $p=100$ is $\\frac{9500-7000}{100-75} = \\frac{2500}{25} = 100$. Since $80 < 100$, the slopes are increasing, which is consistent with a convex function.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise mathematical and technical language, with no subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\nThe problem is free from any of the invalidity flaws listed in the instructions. It is scientifically sound, complete, and well-posed.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n###\nThe solution consists of two parts: a derivation of the general formula and its application to a specific case.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Piecewise Linear Approximation**\n\nLet $\\tilde{C}(p)$ be the piecewise linear approximation to the cost function $C(p)$ on the interval $[p_a, p_b]$. By definition, $\\tilde{C}(p)$ is the value on the straight line segment connecting the points $(p_a, C(p_a))$ and $(p_b, C(p_b))$.\n\nThe equation of this line can be expressed using the two-point form. For any power level $p \\in [p_a, p_b]$, the approximated cost $\\tilde{C}(p)$ lies on this line, so it must satisfy:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tilde{C}(p) - C(p_a)}{p - p_a} = \\frac{C(p_b) - C(p_a)}{p_b - p_a}\n$$\nSolving for $\\tilde{C}(p)$, we get:\n$$\n\\tilde{C}(p) = C(p_a) + \\left( \\frac{C(p_b) - C(p_a)}{p_b - p_a} \\right) (p - p_a)\n$$\nThe problem requires this expression to be formulated in terms of convex combination weights. Any point $p \\in [p_a, p_b]$ can be uniquely expressed as a convex combination of the endpoints $p_a$ and $p_b$:\n$$\np = (1-\\lambda) p_a + \\lambda p_b \\quad \\text{for some } \\lambda \\in [0, 1]\n$$\nWe can find an expression for the weight $\\lambda$ by rearranging the equation:\n$$\np - p_a = (1-\\lambda) p_a + \\lambda p_b - p_a = \\lambda p_b - \\lambda p_a = \\lambda (p_b - p_a)\n$$\nAssuming $p_a \\neq p_b$, we can solve for $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{p - p_a}{p_b - p_a}\n$$\nThe term $(1-\\lambda)$ is the other weight:\n$$\n1 - \\lambda = 1 - \\frac{p - p_a}{p_b - p_a} = \\frac{(p_b - p_a) - (p - p_a)}{p_b - p_a} = \\frac{p_b - p}{p_b - p_a}\n$$\nNow, we substitute $\\lambda$ into our expression for $\\tilde{C}(p)$:\n$$\n\\tilde{C}(p) = C(p_a) + (C(p_b) - C(p_a)) \\lambda\n$$\nDistributing the terms gives:\n$$\n\\tilde{C}(p) = C(p_a) - \\lambda C(p_a) + \\lambda C(p_b)\n$$\nFactoring yields the final expression in terms of the convex combination weights $(1-\\lambda)$ and $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\tilde{C}(p) = (1-\\lambda) C(p_a) + \\lambda C(p_b)\n$$\nThis is the required derivation. It demonstrates that the value of the linear approximation at $p$ is the same convex combination of the costs $C(p_a)$ and $C(p_b)$ as $p$ is of the power levels $p_a$ and $p_b$. Since the original function $C(p)$ is convex, it holds that $C(p) = C((1-\\lambda)p_a + \\lambda p_b) \\le (1-\\lambda)C(p_a)+\\lambda C(p_b) = \\tilde{C}(p)$, meaning the piecewise linear approximation provides an upper bound on the true cost between breakpoints.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Approximate Cost**\n\nWe are asked to compute the approximate cost $c$ for a power output of $p = 80$ MW. The specified adjacent breakpoints are $p_a = 75$ MW and $p_b = 100$ MW. The corresponding costs are given as $C(p_a) = C(75) = 7000$ and $C(p_b) = C(100) = 9500$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the value of the convex combination weight $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{p - p_a}{p_b - p_a} = \\frac{80 - 75}{100 - 75} = \\frac{5}{25} = \\frac{1}{5}\n$$\nThe other weight is therefore $1-\\lambda = 1 - \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{4}{5}$.\n\nNow, we use the derived formula to find the approximate cost $c = \\tilde{C}(80)$:\n$$\nc = (1-\\lambda) C(75) + \\lambda C(100)\n$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\nc = \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right) (7000) + \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) (9500)\n$$\n$$\nc = (0.8)(7000) + (0.2)(9500)\n$$\n$$\nc = 5600 + 1900\n$$\n$$\nc = 7500\n$$\nThe approximate cost for producing $80$ MW of power is $7500$ monetary units.",

The unit’s feasible production range is defined by a minimum power $P_{\\min}$ and a maximum power $P_{\\max}$, with breakpoints at $p=[50,80,100]$ megawatts (MW), so $P_{\\min}=50$ MW and $P_{\\max}=100$ MW.

With the piecewise-constant marginal cost approximation, we have a partition of the production range into segments with constant slopes, which are the marginal costs within those segments. When the formulation is anchored at $P_{\\min}$, the baseline is $c(P_{\\min})=0$, and any production above $P_{\\min}$ incurs cost according to the marginal cost slope of the segment that the additional output occupies.\n\nLet the breakpoints be $p=[50,80,100]$ MW. Thus, the segments are:\n- Segment $1$: $[50,80]$ MW, length $80-50=30$ MW, slope $\\alpha_{1}=20$ dollars per megawatt.\n- Segment $2$: $[80,100]$ MW, length $100-80=20$ MW, slope $\\alpha_{2}=30$ dollars per megawatt.\n\nThe incremental formulation dictates that any power above $P_{\\min}=50$ MW is first allocated to Segment $1$ up to its capacity, and only then to Segment $2$.

Generator $1$, Block $2$: $c_{1,2} = 30$ $/MWh for up to $s_{1,2}=50$ MW.\n\n**Part 1: Unconstrained Dispatch (Ignoring Ramping)**\n\nWe dispatch the generators in merit order for each period independently to meet the demand.\n\n**Period 1 ($t=1$, $D_1=80$ MW):**\n1.  Dispatch Generator $1$, Block $1$ fully: $x_{1,1,1} = 50$ MW. Remaining demand: $80 - 50 = 30$ MW.\n2.  Dispatch Generator $2$, Block $1$ to meet the rest: $x_{2,1,1} = 30$ MW. Remaining demand: $30 - 30 = 0$ MW.\nThe dispatch for Period $1$ is:\n- $p_{1,1} = x_{1,1,1} + x_{1,1,2} = 50 + 0 = 50$ MW.\n- $p_{2,1} = x_{2,1,1} + x_{2,1,2} = 30 + 0 = 30$ MW.\nCheck: $p_{1,1} + p_{2,1} = 50 + 30 = 80$ MW, which equals $D_1$.\n\n**Period 2 ($t=2$, $D_2=140$ MW):**\n1.  Dispatch Generator $1$, Block $1$ fully: $x_{1,2,1} = 50$ MW. Remaining demand: $140 - 50 = 90$ MW.\n2.  Dispatch Generator $2$, Block $1$ fully: $x_{2,2,1} = 30$ MW. Remaining demand: $90 - 30 = 60$ MW.\n3.  Dispatch Generator $2$, Block $2$ to meet the rest: $x_{2,2,2} = 60$ MW. Remaining demand: $60 - 60 = 0$ MW.\nThe dispatch for Period $2$ is:\n- $p_{1,2} = x_{1,2,1} + x_{1,2,2} = 50 + 0 = 50$ MW.\n- $p_{2,2} = x_{2,2,1} + x_{2,2,2} = 30 + 60 = 90$ MW.\nCheck: $p_{1,2} + p_{2,2} = 50 + 90 = 140$ MW, which equals $D_2$.\n\n**Part 2: Check Ramp Constraints**\n\nNow, we check if this unconstrained solution satisfies the ramp constraints $|p_{i,2} - p_{i,1}| \\leq R_i$.\n- **Generator 1**: $|p_{1,2} - p_{1,1}| = |50 - 50| = 0$ MW. The limit is $R_1=30$ MW. Since $0 \\leq 30$, this constraint is satisfied.\n- **Generator 2**: $|p_{2,2} - p_{2,1}| = |90 - 30| = 60$ MW. The limit is $R_2=50$ MW. Since $60 > 50$, this constraint is **violated**.\n\n**Part 3: Redispatch to Satisfy Ramp Constraints**\n\nThe ramp-up of Generator $2$ from $30$ MW to $90$ MW exceeds its limit of $50$ MW. The violation is $p_{2,2} - p_{2,1} - R_2 = 60 - 50 = 10$ MW. To resolve this, we must adjust the dispatch to reduce the difference $p_{2,2} - p_{2,1}$ by at least $10$ MW, incurring the minimum possible additional cost. This can be done by:\n(a) Increasing $p_{2,1}$ (and decreasing $p_{1,1}$).\n(b) Decreasing $p_{2,2}$ (and increasing $p_{1,2}$).\n(c) A combination of both.\n\nLet's analyze the marginal costs of these adjustments.\n- **Adjustment in Period 1**: To increase $p_{2,1}$ by $1$ MW, we must decrease $p_{1,1}$ by $1$ MW. This means shifting generation from Generator $1$ to Generator $2$. At the unconstrained solution, Generator $1$ is producing from its cheapest block ($c_{1,1}=10$), and Generator $2$ has exhausted its first block ($c_{2,1}=15$) and would need to use its second block ($c_{2,2}=25$). Thus, this shift replaces generation at cost $10$ with generation at cost $25$. The cost increase is $25 - 10 = 15$ $/MWh per MW shifted.\n- **Adjustment in Period 2**: To decrease $p_{2,2}$ by $1$ MW, we must increase $p_{1,2}$ by $1$ MW. This means shifting generation from Generator $2$ to Generator $1$. At the unconstrained solution, the marginal unit is Generator $2$, Block $2$ ($c_{2,2}=25$). The next cheapest available unit is Generator $1$, Block $2$ ($c_{1,2}=30$). This shift replaces generation at cost $25$ with generation at cost $30$. The cost increase is $30 - 25 = 5$ $/MWh per MW shifted.\n\nTo satisfy the constraint $p_{2,2} - p_{2,1} \\le 50$ with minimum cost, we need to reduce the difference $p_{2,2} - p_{2,1}$ from $60$ to $50$, a reduction of $10$. We should choose the cheapest adjustment. The adjustment in Period $2$ costs $5$ $/MWh, while the adjustment in Period $1$ costs $15$ $/MWh. Therefore, it is optimal to make the entire adjustment in Period $2$.\n\nWe shift $10$ MW of generation from Generator $2$ to Generator $1$ in Period $2$.\n- No change in Period $1$ dispatch:\n  - $p_{1,1} = 50$ MW\n  - $p_{2,1} = 30$ MW\n- New dispatch for Period $2$:\n  - $p_{1,2} = 50 + 10 = 60$ MW\n  - $p_{2,2} = 90 - 10 = 80$ MW\n\nLet's verify the new ramping:\n- **Generator 1**: $|p_{1,2} - p_{1,1}| = |60 - 50| = 10$ MW. $10 \\leq 30$, OK.\n- **Generator 2**: $|p_{2,2} - p_{2,1}| = |80 - 30| = 50$ MW. $50 \\leq 50$, OK.\nAll constraints are now satisfied.\n\n**Part 4: Calculate Final Dispatch and Total Cost**\n\nThe optimal generation schedule is $(p_{1,1}, p_{2,1}, p_{1,2}, p_{2,2}) = (50, 30, 60, 80)$.
