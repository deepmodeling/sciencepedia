            "introduction": "We begin our hands-on exploration with the theoretical cornerstone of all wake models: the actuator disk theory. This idealized model treats a wind turbine rotor as a simple, permeable disk that creates a pressure drop and extracts momentum from the wind. By applying the fundamental principles of conservation of mass and linear momentum, this exercise  will guide you through the derivation of the key relationships between the freestream wind speed $U_{\\infty}$, the velocity deficit in the far wake, and the power extracted by the turbine, all governed by the axial induction factor $a$. Mastering this derivation is essential for a deep understanding of why wakes form and how their initial properties are determined.",

            "problem": "A single horizontal-axis wind turbine in a large, neutrally stratified onshore wind farm is modeled as a permeable, uniformly loaded actuator disk immersed in a steady, incompressible, axisymmetric stream tube. The far-upstream freestream velocity is $U_{\\infty}$, the air density is $\\rho$, and the rotor area is $A$. Define the axial induction factor $a$ by the disk velocity $U_{\\text{disk}} = U_{\\infty}(1 - a)$. Assume a steady control volume around the stream tube, negligible shear and swirl, equal static pressure far upstream and far downstream, and that Bernoulli’s equation applies along streamlines outside the disk, with a pressure jump across the disk.\n\nStarting from conservation of mass and conservation of linear momentum applied to the control volume, together with the above assumptions, derive the far-wake centerline velocity $U_{d}$ downstream of the turbine in terms of $U_{\\infty}$ and $a$, and derive the extracted mechanical power $P$ in terms of $\\rho$, $A$, $U_{\\infty}$, and $a$.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is a standard application of the Rankine-Froude actuator disk model, which is a fundamental and scientifically grounded concept in wind energy engineering. The problem is well-posed, objective, self-contained, and uses realistic physical parameters.\n\nWe begin by applying the principles of conservation of mass and linear momentum to a control volume defined by the stream tube that passes through the turbine disk. Let the cross-sectional area of the stream tube be $A_{\\infty}$ far upstream, $A$ at the disk, and $A_d$ far downstream. The corresponding axial velocities are $U_{\\infty}$, $U_{\\text{disk}}$, and $U_d$. The static pressures are $p_{\\infty}$, $p_{\\text{up}}$ (just upstream of the disk), $p_{\\text{down}}$ (just downstream of the disk), and $p_d$ far downstream.\n\nFirst, by the principle of conservation of mass for an incompressible fluid of density $\\rho$, the mass flow rate $\\dot{m}$ through the stream tube is constant. The mass flow rate passing through the turbine disk is:\n$$\n\\dot{m} = \\rho A U_{\\text{disk}}\n$$\nUsing the given definition for the axial induction factor, $a$, we have $U_{\\text{disk}} = U_{\\infty}(1-a)$. Substituting this into the mass flow rate expression gives:\n$$\n\\dot{m} = \\rho A U_{\\infty}(1-a)\n$$\n\nNext, we apply the conservation of linear momentum. The net force on the fluid within the control volume is equal to the rate of change of momentum of the fluid passing through it. The force exerted by the turbine on the fluid is directed upstream, which we denote as $-T$, where $T$ is the thrust on the turbine. According to the momentum theorem, the total force on the fluid in the stream tube is:\n$$\n\\sum F_{x} = \\dot{m} (U_{d} - U_{\\infty})\n$$\nThe force on the fluid is composed of pressure forces on the control volume surfaces and the force $-T$ from the disk. Assuming the pressure far upstream and far downstream is equal to the freestream static pressure, $p_{\\infty} = p_d$ as given, the net force on the fluid is simply $-T$. Thus,\n$$\n-T = \\dot{m} (U_{d} - U_{\\infty})\n$$\nThe thrust force on the turbine is therefore:\n$$\nT = \\dot{m} (U_{\\infty} - U_{d})\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\dot{m}$:\n$$\nT = \\rho A U_{\\text{disk}} (U_{\\infty} - U_{d})\n$$\n\nNow, we apply Bernoulli's equation. It is assumed to be valid along streamlines upstream of the disk and downstream of the disk, but not across the disk itself, where energy is extracted.\nApplying Bernoulli's equation from far upstream to just before the disk:\n$$\np_{\\infty} + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho U_{\\infty}^2 = p_{\\text{up}} + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho U_{\\text{disk}}^2\n$$\nApplying it from just after the disk to far downstream, and using the given condition $p_d = p_{\\infty}$:\n$$\np_{\\text{down}} + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho U_{\\text{disk}}^2 = p_{d} + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho U_{d}^2 = p_{\\infty} + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho U_{d}^2\n$$\nBy rearranging these two equations, we can find expressions for $p_{\\text{up}}$ and $p_{\\text{down}}$:\n$$\np_{\\text{up}} = p_{\\infty} + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho (U_{\\infty}^2 - U_{\\text{disk}}^2)\n$$\n$$\np_{\\text{down}} = p_{\\infty} + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho (U_{d}^2 - U_{\\text{disk}}^2)\n$$\nThe thrust $T$ is also the result of the pressure difference across the disk, integrated over the disk area $A$:\n$$\nT = (p_{\\text{up}} - p_{\\text{down}}) A\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $p_{\\text{up}}$ and $p_{\\text{down}}$:\n$$\nT = \\left[ \\left(p_{\\infty} + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho (U_{\\infty}^2 - U_{\\text{disk}}^2)\\right) - \\left(p_{\\infty} + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho (U_{d}^2 - U_{\\text{disk}}^2)\\right) \\right] A\n$$\n$$\nT = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho A (U_{\\infty}^2 - U_{d}^2)\n$$\nWe now have two expressions for the thrust $T$. Equating them:\n$$\n\\rho A U_{\\text{disk}} (U_{\\infty} - U_{d}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho A (U_{\\infty}^2 - U_{d}^2)\n$$\nWe can cancel $\\rho A$ from both sides and factor the difference of squares:\n$$\nU_{\\text{disk}} (U_{\\infty} - U_{d}) = \\frac{1}{2} (U_{\\infty} - U_{d}) (U_{\\infty} + U_{d})\n$$\nFor a non-trivial case where $U_{\\infty} \\neq U_d$, we can cancel the term $(U_{\\infty} - U_{d})$, which yields a central result of actuator disk theory:\n$$\nU_{\\text{disk}} = \\frac{1}{2} (U_{\\infty} + U_{d})\n$$\nThis shows that the velocity through the disk is the average of the far upstream and far downstream velocities.\n\nTo derive $U_d$ in terms of $U_{\\infty}$ and $a$, we substitute the definition $U_{\\text{disk}} = U_{\\infty}(1-a)$:\n$$\nU_{\\infty}(1-a) = \\frac{1}{2} (U_{\\infty} + U_{d})\n$$\n$$\n2U_{\\infty}(1-a) = U_{\\infty} + U_{d}\n$$\n$$\nU_{d} = 2U_{\\infty} - 2aU_{\\infty} - U_{\\infty}\n$$\n$$\nU_{d} = U_{\\infty}(1-2a)\n$$\nThis is the required expression for the far-wake velocity. For this model to be physically meaningful (i.e., $U_d > 0$), $a$ must be less than $1/2$.\n\nNext, we derive the extracted mechanical power $P$. Power is the rate at which the turbine does work, which is the thrust force multiplied by the velocity of the fluid at the disk:\n$$\nP = T U_{\\text{disk}}\n$$\nUsing the momentum expression for thrust $T = \\dot{m}(U_{\\infty} - U_{d})$ and the relation $\\dot{m} = \\rho A U_{\\text{disk}}$:\n$$\nP = (\\rho A U_{\\text{disk}} (U_{\\infty} - U_{d})) U_{\\text{disk}} = \\rho A U_{\\text{disk}}^2 (U_{\\infty} - U_{d})\n$$\nNow we substitute the expressions for $U_{\\text{disk}}$ and $U_d$ in terms of $U_{\\infty}$ and $a$:\n$$\nU_{\\text{disk}} = U_{\\infty}(1-a)\n$$\n$$\nU_d = U_{\\infty}(1-2a)\n$$\n$$\nP = \\rho A (U_{\\infty}(1-a))^2 (U_{\\infty} - U_{\\infty}(1-2a))\n$$\n$$\nP = \\rho A U_{\\infty}^2 (1-a)^2 (U_{\\infty} - U_{\\infty} + 2aU_{\\infty})\n$$\n$$\nP = \\rho A U_{\\infty}^2 (1-a)^2 (2aU_{\\infty})\n$$\n$$\nP = 2\\rho A U_{\\infty}^3 a(1-a)^2\n$$\nThis is the required expression for the extracted power.\n\nThe power coefficient $C_p$ is defined as $C_{p} \\equiv \\dfrac{P}{\\tfrac{1}{2}\\rho A U_{\\infty}^{3}}$. Substituting our expression for $P$:\n$$\nC_p = \\frac{2\\rho A U_{\\infty}^3 a(1-a)^2}{\\frac{1}{2}\\rho A U_{\\infty}^3}\n$$\nCanceling common terms, we find the power coefficient solely in terms of $a$:\n$$\nC_p = 4a(1-a)^2\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical values for $U_d$ and $P$ using the provided data: $\\rho = 1.225\\,\\text{kg m}^{-3}$, $A = 1.0000 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\text{m}^{2}$, $U_{\\infty} = 10.0\\,\\text{m s}^{-1}$, and $a = \\dfrac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe far-wake velocity $U_d$ is:\n$$\nU_d = U_{\\infty}(1-2a) = 10.0 \\left(1 - 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}\\right) = 10.0 \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3}\\right) = 10.0 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\frac{10.0}{3}\\,\\text{m s}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nU_d \\approx 3.3333...\\,\\text{m s}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, $U_d = 3.333\\,\\text{m s}^{-1}$.\n\nThe extracted power $P$ is:\n$$\nP = 2\\rho A U_{\\infty}^3 a(1-a)^2 = 2(1.225)(1.0000 \\times 10^4)(10.0)^3 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\left(1-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2\n$$\n$$\nP = 2(1.225)(10^4)(10^3) \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 = 2.45 \\times 10^7 \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{4}{9}\n$$\n$$\nP = 2.45 \\times 10^7 \\times \\frac{4}{27} = \\frac{9.8}{27} \\times 10^7\\,\\text{W}\n$$\n$$\nP \\approx 0.36296296... \\times 10^7\\,\\text{W} = 3.6296296... \\times 10^6\\,\\text{W}\n$$\nSince $1\\,\\text{MW} = 10^6\\,\\text{W}$, the power in megawatts is $P \\approx 3.6296296...\\,\\text{MW}$.\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, $P = 3.630\\,\\text{MW}$.\n\nThe numerical results are $U_d = 3.333\\,\\text{m s}^{-1}$ and $P = 3.630\\,\\text{MW}$.",

The Park model, also known as the Jensen model, is a classic and widely-used approach that simplifies the wake as a uniformly mixed, expanding cone, providing a crucial tool for first-order analysis of wind farm performance. This practice  challenges you to translate this model into code, focusing on the critical geometric calculation of the wake's overlap area with a downstream turbine and its effect on the area-averaged wind speed.

You must build the algorithm from first principles grounded in mass and momentum conservation and elementary Euclidean geometry, without relying on any shortcut formulas given in this statement. The model must be implemented for a set of test cases with numerically specified parameters and produce a single line of output in the exact required format.\n\nFundamental base and assumptions:\n- Use conservation of mass and momentum as they apply to actuator disk theory to relate thrust to velocity deficit behind an upstream rotor and the established Park model scaling for wake expansion downstream based on turbulent entrainment. The Park model assumes a uniform velocity deficit within an expanding circular wake cross-section and no yaw misalignment.\n- The upstream wake expands linearly downstream; the cross-sectional wake region is circular with a centerline aligned with the upstream turbine axis. The downstream turbine center may be laterally offset relative to the wake centerline.\n- The downstream rotor is circular. The impacted region is the intersection area between the wake circle at the downstream position and the downstream rotor circle.\n- The rotor-average wind speed at the downstream turbine plane is obtained by an area-weighted mixture of the ambient undisturbed wind and the uniform wake deficit, with the deficit predicted by the Park model at the considered downstream position.\n\nRequired outputs for each test case:\n- The impacted area of the downstream rotor by the upstream wake, expressed in square meters (m²) as a float.\n- The rotor-average wind speed at the downstream turbine plane, expressed in meters per second (m/s) as a float.\n- Both outputs must be rounded to six decimal places.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each test case result is itself a two-element list in the form $[A_{\\text{impacted}}, U_{\\text{avg}}]$ (e.g., $[[1.234000,7.890000],[...],...]$).\n\nDefinitions:\n- Let $D_u$ be the upstream rotor diameter in meters.\n- Let $D_d$ be the downstream rotor diameter in meters.\n- Let $R_u = D_u/2$ be the upstream rotor radius in meters.\n- Let $R_d = D_d/2$ be the downstream rotor radius in meters.\n- Let $U_\\infty$ be the ambient inflow wind speed in meters per second.\n- Let $C_T$ be the upstream turbine thrust coefficient (dimensionless).\n- Let $k_w$ be the wake expansion coefficient (dimensionless) governing the linear wake radius growth.\n- Let $x$ be the streamwise spacing between turbine centers in meters.\n- Let $y$ be the lateral offset between turbine centers in meters, measured perpendicular to the wind direction at the downstream plane.\n- Let $r_w(x)$ be the wake radius at downstream distance $x$ in meters according to the Park model.\n- Let $\\Delta$ be the streamwise velocity deficit ratio within the wake at distance $x$ according to the Park model.\n- Let $A_{\\cap}$ be the geometric intersection area between the wake circle of radius $r_w(x)$ and the downstream rotor circle of radius $R_d$ with center separation $d = y$.\n- Let $A_d = \\pi R_d^2$ be the downstream rotor area in square meters.\n- Let $A_{\\text{impacted}} = A_{\\cap}$ be the impacted portion of the downstream rotor area.\n- Let $U_{\\text{avg}}$ be the area-weighted average wind speed over the downstream rotor circle.\n\nAlgorithmic tasks you must implement:\n1.

            "solution": "The problem is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the established Park (Jensen) model for wind turbine wakes, which is a standard simplification based on conservation laws. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and definitions for a unique solution. The language is objective and the tasks are specified without ambiguity.\n\nThe solution is developed by implementing the four algorithmic tasks specified in the problem statement, grounding each step in the requested first principles.\n\n**1. Wake Radius, $r_w(x)$**\n\nThe Park model assumes that the turbine wake expands linearly with the downstream distance $x$. The wake is modeled as a circular cross-section whose radius $r_w(x)$ grows from its initial value, the upstream rotor radius $R_u$, according to a wake expansion coefficient $k_w$.\n\nThe formula for the wake radius at a distance $x$ is:\n$$r_w(x) = R_u + k_w x$$\nwhere $R_u = D_u/2$ is the upstream rotor radius. This linear expansion is an empirical model for the turbulent entrainment of ambient air into the wake.\n\n**2. Velocity Deficit, $\\Delta(x)$**\n\nThe velocity deficit within the wake is derived from the conservation of momentum, linking the thrust exerted by the turbine to the momentum deficit in the downstream flow.\n\nFrom actuator disk theory, the thrust $T$ is given by $T = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho A_u C_T U_\\infty^2$, where $\\rho$ is the air density, $A_u = \\pi R_u^2$ is the rotor area, $C_T$ is the thrust coefficient, and $U_\\infty$ is the ambient wind speed.\n\nThe thrust is also the rate of momentum change imparted to the air. In one-dimensional momentum theory, the far-wake velocity $U_{w, \\text{far}}$ is related to the axial induction factor $a$ by $U_{w, \\text{far}} = U_\\infty(1-2a)$. The thrust coefficient is $C_T = 4a(1-a)$. Assuming the turbine operates in the windmill state ($a  1/2$), we can solve for $2a$:\n$$1-C_T = (1-2a)^2 \\implies \\sqrt{1-C_T} = 1-2a \\implies 2a = 1 - \\sqrt{1-C_T}$$\nThe velocity deficit in the far wake, relative to the ambient speed, is $\\Delta U_{\\text{far}} = U_\\infty - U_{w, \\text{far}} = 2aU_\\infty$. The initial deficit ratio is thus $2a$.\n\nThe Park model assumes this momentum deficit is conserved as the wake expands. The momentum flux deficit at a downstream distance $x$ is assumed to be proportional to the wake area $A_w(x) = \\pi r_w(x)^2$ and the local velocity deficit $U_\\infty - U_w(x)$. By conserving the momentum deficit:\n$$(U_\\infty - U_w(x)) A_w(x) \\propto (U_\\infty - U_{w, \\text{far}}) A_u$$\nThis leads to the velocity deficit at distance $x$, $\\Delta U(x) = U_\\infty - U_w(x)$, scaling with the initial deficit and the ratio of the areas:\n$$\\Delta U(x) = (2a U_\\infty) \\frac{A_u}{A_w(x)}$$\nDividing by $U_\\infty$ gives the dimensionless deficit ratio $\\Delta(x)$:\n$$\\Delta(x) = \\frac{U_\\infty - U_w(x)}{U_\\infty} = (2a) \\frac{\\pi R_u^2}{\\pi r_w(x)^2} = (1 - \\sqrt{1-C_T}) \\left(\\frac{R_u}{r_w(x)}\\right)^2$$\nSubstituting $r_w(x) = R_u + k_w x$:\n$$\\Delta(x) = \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{1-C_T}}{(1 + k_w x / R_u)^2}$$\nThe velocity inside the wake at distance $x$ is then $U_w(x) = U_\\infty(1 - \\Delta(x))$.\n\n**3. Intersection Area, $A_{\\cap}$**\n\nThe impacted area of the downstream rotor is the geometric intersection of two circles: the wake circle with radius $r_1 = r_w(x)$ and the downstream rotor circle with radius $r_2 = R_d = D_d/2$. The distance between their centers is $d=y$.\n\nThe calculation proceeds by considering three distinct geometric cases:\na. **No Overlap**: If the distance between the centers is greater than or equal to the sum of the radii, the circles do not intersect or are externally tangent.\n$$d \\ge r_1 + r_2 \\implies A_{\\cap} = 0$$\nb. **Full Containment**: If the distance between centers is less than or equal to the absolute difference of their radii, the smaller circle is entirely contained within the larger one (or they are internally tangent).\n$$d \\le |r_1 - r_2| \\implies A_{\\cap} = \\pi (\\min(r_1, r_2))^2$$\nc. **Partial Overlap**: If $|r_1 - r_2|  d  r_1 + r_2$, the circles partially intersect. The intersection area is the sum of the areas of the two circular segments formed by the common chord of the circles.\n\nThe area of a circular segment is the area of the circular sector minus the area of the triangle formed by the radii and the chord. For a circle of radius $r$ and a segment defined by a central angle $\\theta$ (in radians), the area is $A_{\\text{seg}} = \\frac{1}{2}r^2(\\theta - \\sin\\theta)$.\n\nThe central angles, $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$, for the segments in each circle can be found using the Law of Cosines. Consider the triangle formed by the two centers and one of the intersection points. Its sides are $r_1$, $r_2$, and $d$. The half-angles at the centers are:\n$$\\alpha_1 = \\text{arccos}\\left(\\frac{d^2 + r_1^2 - r_2^2}{2 d r_1}\\right)$$\n$$\\alpha_2 = \\text{arccos}\\left(\\frac{d^2 + r_2^2 - r_1^2}{2 d r_2}\\right)$$\nThe full central angles are $\\theta_1 = 2\\alpha_1$ and $\\theta_2 = 2\\alpha_2$. The total intersection area is the sum of the two segment areas:\n$$A_{\\cap} = A_{\\text{seg},1} + A_{\\text{seg},2} = \\frac{1}{2}r_1^2(\\theta_1 - \\sin\\theta_1) + \\frac{1}{2}r_2^2(\\theta_2 - \\sin\\theta_2)$$\nThis formula robustly calculates the intersection area for the partial overlap case. The final impacted area is $A_{\\text{impacted}} = A_{\\cap}$.\n\n**4. Average Wind Speed, $U_{\\text{avg}}$**\n\nThe rotor-average wind speed $U_{\\text{avg}}$ at the downstream turbine is the area-weighted average of the wind speeds over its rotor disk area, $A_d = \\pi R_d^2$. The portion of the disk inside the wake, $A_{\\cap}$, experiences the wake velocity $U_w(x)$, while the portion outside the wake, $A_d - A_{\\cap}$, experiences the ambient velocity $U_\\infty$.\n\nThe weighted average is:\n$$U_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{U_w(x) \\cdot A_{\\cap} + U_\\infty \\cdot (A_d - A_{\\cap})}{A_d}$$\nSubstituting $U_w(x) = U_\\infty(1 - \\Delta(x))$:\n$$U_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{U_\\infty(1 - \\Delta(x)) A_{\\cap} + U_\\infty A_d - U_\\infty A_{\\cap}}{A_d}$$\n$$U_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{U_\\infty A_d - U_\\infty \\Delta(x) A_{\\cap}}{A_d}$$\nSimplifying yields the final expression:\n$$U_{\\text{avg}} = U_\\infty \\left(1 - \\Delta(x) \\frac{A_{\\cap}}{A_d}\\right)$$\nThis formula is used to calculate the area-weighted average wind speed.

            "introduction": "Having modeled the passive effects of wakes, we now explore how to actively control them to optimize the entire wind farm's output. Wake steering, a state-of-the-art control strategy, involves intentionally yawing an upstream turbine to deflect its wake away from downstream turbines, trading a small loss at one turbine for a larger gain at another. This practice  requires you to derive and implement a model for wake deflection based on the lateral momentum imparted by a yawed rotor. By calculating the required yaw angle $\\gamma$ to achieve a target offset, you will gain insight into the sophisticated control logic that governs modern wind farms.",
            "id": "4136836",
            "problem": "You are given a scenario of two aligned horizontal-axis wind turbines in uniform inflow. The upstream turbine is deliberately yawed by an angle $\\gamma$ to laterally deflect its wake so that, at a specified downstream distance, the wake centerline reaches at least a requested lateral offset. Your task is to derive from fundamental principles an explicit algorithm to compute the minimum yaw angle that achieves the requested downstream wake offset, and then quantify the yaw-induced power loss using a standard cosine model. You must then implement the algorithm as a complete program that evaluates several parameter sets and produces a single-line list of results.\n\nStart from the following fundamental base and modeling assumptions, each of which should be used as the starting point for your derivation:\n\n- Conservation of streamwise and lateral momentum in a steady control volume around the wake, with lateral momentum in the wake arising from the lateral force generated by yawing the rotor. Assume the thrust force magnitude is associated with the streamwise thrust coefficient and freestream speed.\n- The upstream turbine has rotor radius $R$, rotor swept area $A = \\pi R^2$, is yawed by an angle $\\gamma$ relative to the incoming wind, and operates at thrust coefficient $C_T$ with freestream speed $U_{\\infty}$. Take the thrust force magnitude to be $T = \\tfrac{1}{2} \\rho A U_{\\infty}^2 C_T$ and its lateral component to be $F_y = T \\sin{\\gamma}$, where $\\rho$ is the air density (you may assume that $\\rho$ cancels out in the derivation and no numerical value is required).\n- Model the wake cross-section as a top-hat with radius $r(x)$ that expands linearly downstream: $r(x) = R + k x$, where $k$ is a constant wake expansion coefficient and $x$ is the downstream distance from the turbine.\n- Model the convective transport speed of the wake centerline as $U_{\\infty}$ and the mass flow in the wake cross-section as $\\dot{m}(x) = \\rho U_{\\infty} \\pi r(x)^2$. Model the average lateral velocity of the wake cross-section at downstream distance $x$ as $v_y(x) = F_y / \\dot{m}(x)$.\n- Geometrically, the wake centerline deflection satisfies $\\mathrm{d}y_w/\\mathrm{d}x = v_y(x)/U_{\\infty}$ with $y_w(0) = 0$.\n\nUsing only these base relations and standard calculus and trigonometry, derive an explicit expression for the wake centerline lateral position $y_w(x)$ as a function of $x$, $R$, $k$, $C_T$, and $\\gamma$. Then, given a specified target lateral offset $y_{\\mathrm{target}}$ at downstream location $x = x_d$, define the minimum yaw angle $\\gamma^\\star$ that achieves $y_w(x_d) \\ge y_{\\mathrm{target}}$ subject to a maximum allowable yaw bound $0 \\le \\gamma \\le \\gamma_{\\max}$. If $y_{\\mathrm{target}}$ is not reachable within the bound, set $\\gamma^\\star = \\gamma_{\\max}$. Express the yaw-induced relative power for the upstream turbine as $P_{\\mathrm{rel}} = \\cos^p(\\gamma^\\star)$ where $p$ is a given positive exponent.\n\nYour program must implement the above derivation to compute, for each parameter set, the pair consisting of the minimum yaw angle in degrees and the corresponding relative power. Use angles in radians internally for trigonometric functions, but the reported yaw angle must be in degrees. All distances must be in meters. The final output for each test case must be a two-element list $[\\gamma^\\star_{\\mathrm{deg}}, P_{\\mathrm{rel}}]$, where $\\gamma^\\star_{\\mathrm{deg}}$ is in degrees and $P_{\\mathrm{rel}}$ is dimensionless. Report both numbers rounded to four decimal places.\n\nTest suite. Use the following four parameter sets, each specified as a tuple $(D, C_T, k, x_d, y_{\\mathrm{target}}, p, \\gamma_{\\max,\\mathrm{deg}})$, where $D$ is diameter in meters, $R = D/2$, $C_T$ is dimensionless, $k$ is dimensionless, $x_d$ is in meters, $y_{\\mathrm{target}}$ is in meters, $p$ is dimensionless, and $\\gamma_{\\max,\\mathrm{deg}}$ is in degrees:\n\n- Case A: $(120, 0.8, 0.05, 600, 20, 2.0, 30)$.\n- Case B: $(150, 0.9, 0.04, 750, 150, 1.88, 30)$.\n- Case C: $(100, 0.75, 0.06, 400, 0, 2.1, 30)$.\n- Case D: $(120, 0.8, 0.1, 50, 10, 2.0, 25)$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each element corresponds to one test case and is itself a two-element list in the form $[\\gamma^\\star_{\\mathrm{deg}}, P_{\\mathrm{rel}}]$. For example, the string should look like $[[a_1,b_1],[a_2,b_2],[a_3,b_3],[a_4,b_4]]$ with no extra spaces or text. All angles must be expressed in degrees, rounded to four decimal places, and all relative powers must be rounded to four decimal places.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is determined to be a valid, well-posed, and scientifically grounded problem in the field of wind energy systems modeling. All necessary data, models, and constraints are provided to derive a unique and meaningful solution.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two stages. First, an explicit analytical expression for the wake centerline deflection $y_w(x)$ is derived from the provided fundamental principles. Second, this expression is used to formulate an algorithm for computing the minimum required yaw angle $\\gamma^\\star$ and the associated relative power $P_{\\mathrm{rel}}$.\n\n**1. Derivation of Wake Centerline Deflection**\n\nThe evolution of the wake centerline's lateral position, $y_w$, is governed by the differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y_w}{\\mathrm{d}x} = \\frac{v_y(x)}{U_{\\infty}}\n$$\nwith the initial condition $y_w(0) = 0$. Here, $v_y(x)$ is the average lateral velocity of the wake at a downstream distance $x$, and $U_{\\infty}$ is the freestream wind speed.\n\nThe lateral velocity $v_y(x)$ is determined by the balance of momentum, given as the ratio of the lateral force $F_y$ exerted by the yawed turbine to the mass flow rate $\\dot{m}(x)$ through the wake cross-section at that location:\n$$\nv_y(x) = \\frac{F_y}{\\dot{m}(x)}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the models for $F_y$ and $\\dot{m}(x)$. The lateral force is the component of the total thrust force $T$ perpendicular to the incoming wind direction:\n$$\nF_y = T \\sin{\\gamma} = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\rho A U_{\\infty}^2 C_T \\right) \\sin{\\gamma}\n$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the air density, $A = \\pi R^2$ is the rotor area, $R$ is the rotor radius, $C_T$ is the thrust coefficient, and $\\gamma$ is the yaw angle.\n\nThe mass flow rate is modeled assuming a top-hat velocity profile with speed $U_{\\infty}$ across a wake of expanding radius $r(x)$:\n$$\n\\dot{m}(x) = \\rho U_{\\infty} \\pi r(x)^2\n$$\nThe wake radius expands linearly with distance $x$ according to $r(x) = R + kx$, where $k$ is the wake expansion coefficient.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the equation for $v_y(x)$:\n$$\nv_y(x) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho (\\pi R^2) U_{\\infty}^2 C_T \\sin{\\gamma}}{\\rho U_{\\infty} \\pi (R+kx)^2} = \\frac{R^2 U_{\\infty} C_T \\sin{\\gamma}}{2(R+kx)^2}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this result back into the governing differential equation for $y_w$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y_w}{\\mathrm{d}x} = \\frac{1}{U_{\\infty}} \\left( \\frac{R^2 U_{\\infty} C_T \\sin{\\gamma}}{2(R+kx)^2} \\right) = \\frac{R^2 C_T \\sin{\\gamma}}{2(R+kx)^2}\n$$\nAs stated in the problem, both the air density $\\rho$ and the freestream velocity $U_{\\infty}$ cancel from the final differential equation.\n\nTo find the wake centerline position $y_w(x)$, we integrate this equation from the turbine's location ($x=0$) to a downstream distance $x$, using the initial condition $y_w(0) = 0$:\n$$\ny_w(x) = \\int_{0}^{x} \\frac{R^2 C_T \\sin{\\gamma}}{2(R+k\\xi)^2} \\mathrm{d}\\xi\n$$\nThe terms constant with respect to the integration variable $\\xi$ can be moved outside the integral:\n$$\ny_w(x) = \\frac{R^2 C_T \\sin{\\gamma}}{2} \\int_{0}^{x} (R+k\\xi)^{-2} \\mathrm{d}\\xi\n$$\nThe integral evaluates to:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{x} (R+k\\xi)^{-2} \\mathrm{d}\\xi = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{k} (R+k\\xi)^{-1} \\right]_0^x = -\\frac{1}{k} \\left( \\frac{1}{R+kx} - \\frac{1}{R} \\right)\n$$\nCombining the terms inside the parenthesis:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{k} \\left( \\frac{R - (R+kx)}{R(R+kx)} \\right) = -\\frac{1}{k} \\left( \\frac{-kx}{R(R+kx)} \\right) = \\frac{x}{R(R+kx)}\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $y_w(x)$:\n$$\ny_w(x) = \\frac{R^2 C_T \\sin{\\gamma}}{2} \\left( \\frac{x}{R(R+kx)} \\right)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the final analytical expression for the wake centerline deflection:\n$$\ny_w(x) = \\frac{R C_T x \\sin{\\gamma}}{2(R+kx)}\n$$\n\n**2. Algorithm for Minimum Yaw Angle and Relative Power**\n\nThe goal is to find the minimum yaw angle $\\gamma^\\star$ such that at a specific downstream distance $x_d$, the wake deflection is at least a target value $y_{\\mathrm{target}}$, i.e., $y_w(x_d) \\ge y_{\\mathrm{target}}$. The yaw angle is constrained by $0 \\le \\gamma \\le \\gamma_{\\max}$.\n\nWe begin with the inequality:\n$$\n\\frac{R C_T x_d \\sin{\\gamma}}{2(R+kx_d)} \\ge y_{\\mathrm{target}}\n$$\nFor non-negative $\\gamma$, the function $\\sin(\\gamma)$ is non-decreasing in the range of interest (up to $\\gamma_{\\max} \\le 90^\\circ$). To find the minimum $\\gamma$, we solve the equality:\n$$\n\\sin{\\gamma} = \\frac{2 y_{\\mathrm{target}} (R+kx_d)}{R C_T x_d}\n$$\nLet us define the right-hand side as the required sine value, $S$:\n$$\nS = \\frac{2 y_{\\mathrm{target}} (R+kx_d)}{R C_T x_d}\n$$\nThe required yaw angle in radians, $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{req}}$, would be $\\arcsin(S)$. We must now consider all constraints.\n\nThe algorithm to determine the optimal yaw angle $\\gamma^\\star$ is as follows:\n1.  If $y_{\\mathrm{target}} \\le 0$, the condition $y_w(x_d) \\ge y_{\\mathrm{target}}$ is satisfied with zero deflection. Since we seek the minimum non-negative yaw angle, $\\gamma^\\star = 0$.\n2.  If $y_{\\mathrm{target}} > 0$, we calculate the value $S$.\n    a. If $S > \\sin(\\gamma_{\\max})$, the required yaw angle exceeds the maximum allowable yaw $\\gamma_{\\max}$ (this case also includes the physical impossibility where $S>1$). According to the problem, if the target is not reachable within the bound, we must set the yaw to its maximum value. Thus, $\\gamma^\\star = \\gamma_{\\max}$.\n    b. If $0  S \\le \\sin(\\gamma_{\\max})$, the target is reachable within the yaw limits. The minimum required yaw is $\\gamma^\\star = \\arcsin(S)$.\n\nThis logic can be compactly implemented by calculating the required angle $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{req}} = \\arcsin(S)$ and then clipping it to the valid range $[0, \\gamma_{\\max}]$. Care must be taken for the case where $S > 1$, for which $\\arcsin$ is undefined. A robust implementation clips the argument $S$ to the domain $[-1, 1]$ before applying $\\arcsin$.\n\nThe final computational procedure is:\n1.  Given the input parameters $(D, C_T, k, x_d, y_{\\mathrm{target}}, p, \\gamma_{\\max,\\mathrm{deg}})$, calculate $R = D/2$ and convert $\\gamma_{\\max,\\mathrm{deg}}$ to radians, $\\gamma_{\\max,\\mathrm{rad}}$.\n2.  If $y_{\\mathrm{target}} \\le 0$, set $\\gamma^\\star_{\\mathrm{rad}} = 0$.\n3.  If $y_{\\mathrm{target}} > 0$, compute $S = \\frac{2 y_{\\mathrm{target}} (R+kx_d)}{R C_T x_d}$.\n    - If $S > \\sin(\\gamma_{\\max,\\mathrm{rad}})$, set $\\gamma^\\star_{\\mathrm{rad}} = \\gamma_{\\max,\\mathrm{rad}}$.\n    - Otherwise, set $\\gamma^\\star_{\\mathrm{rad}} = \\arcsin(S)$.\n4.  Convert the final yaw angle to degrees: $\\gamma^\\star_{\\mathrm{deg}} = \\gamma^\\star_{\\mathrm{rad}} \\cdot 180/\\pi$.\n5.  Calculate the relative power using the found yaw angle in radians: $P_{\\mathrm{rel}} = \\cos^p(\\gamma^\\star_{\\mathrm{rad}})$.\n6.  Return the pair $[\\gamma^\\star_{\\mathrm{deg}}, P_{\\mathrm{rel}}]$ rounded to four decimal places.\n\nThis procedure correctly handles all specified cases and constraints.",
