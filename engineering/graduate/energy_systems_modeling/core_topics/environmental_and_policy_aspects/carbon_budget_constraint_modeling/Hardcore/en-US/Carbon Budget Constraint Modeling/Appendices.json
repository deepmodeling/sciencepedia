            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a clear set of definitions and realistic parameters from the field of energy systems engineering to derive a standard performance metric.\n\nThe derivation for the marginal emissions intensity, $\\phi_{i,t}$, begins by formalizing the relationships between the given quantities. Let $E_{fuel, i, t}$ represent the fuel energy input to generator $i$ in time period $t$, and let $E_{elec, i, t}$ represent the net delivered electrical energy output. Let $M_{\\mathrm{CO_2}, form, i, t}$, $M_{\\mathrm{CO_2}, capt, i, t}$, and $M_{\\mathrm{CO_2}, emit, i, t}$ denote the mass of carbon dioxide formed during combustion, captured, and emitted to the atmosphere, respectively.\n\nFrom the problem's definitions:\n1.  The net electrical efficiency $\\eta_{i,t}$ is the ratio of electrical output to fuel input:\n    $$ \\eta_{i,t} = \\frac{E_{elec, i, t}}{E_{fuel, i, t}} $$\n2.  The fuel carbon content $c_i$ relates the mass of $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ formed to the fuel energy input:\n    $$ c_i = \\frac{M_{\\mathrm{CO_2}, form, i, t}}{E_{fuel, i, t}} $$\n3.  The carbon capture fraction $\\kappa_{i,t}$ is the ratio of captured $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ to formed $\\mathrm{CO_2}$:\n    $$ \\kappa_{i,t} = \\frac{M_{\\mathrm{CO_2}, capt, i, t}}{M_{\\mathrm{CO_2}, form, i, t}} $$\n\nThe derivation rests on a carbon mass balance for the generator. The mass of $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ emitted is the total mass formed during combustion less the mass that is captured and stored.\n$$ M_{\\mathrm{CO_2}, emit, i, t} = M_{\\mathrm{CO_2}, form, i, t} - M_{\\mathrm{CO_2}, capt, i, t} $$\nSubstituting the definition of $\\kappa_{i,t}$ from equation (3) into the mass balance gives:\n$$ M_{\\mathrm{CO_2}, emit, i, t} = M_{\\mathrm{CO_2}, form, i, t} - \\kappa_{i,t} M_{\\mathrm{CO_2}, form, i, t} = (1 - \\kappa_{i,t}) M_{\\mathrm{CO_2}, form, i, t} $$\nNext, using the definition of $c_i$ from equation (2) to express the mass of $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ formed:\n$$ M_{\\mathrm{CO_2}, emit, i, t} = (1 - \\kappa_{i,t}) (c_i E_{fuel, i, t}) $$\n\nThe marginal emissions intensity $\\phi_{i,t}$ is defined as the emitted $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ per unit of delivered electricity:\n$$ \\phi_{i,t} = \\frac{M_{\\mathrm{CO_2}, emit, i, t}}{E_{elec, i, t}} $$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $M_{\\mathrm{CO_2}, emit, i, t}$:\n$$ \\phi_{i,t} = \\frac{(1 - \\kappa_{i,t}) c_i E_{fuel, i, t}}{E_{elec, i, t}} $$\nFrom the definition of efficiency in equation (1), the ratio of fuel energy input to electrical energy output is the inverse of the efficiency, $E_{fuel, i, t} / E_{elec, i, t} = 1/\\eta_{i,t}$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\phi_{i,t}$ yields the final analytical formula:\n$$ \\phi_{i,t} = \\frac{c_i (1 - \\kappa_{i,t})}{\\eta_{i,t}} $$\n\nThis derivation is founded upon the provided definitions and the principle of mass conservation. The key modeling assumption, as stated, is that the analysis only considers direct stack emissions. The definition that $\\eta_{i,t}$ is net of the capture energy penalty is crucial, as it correctly allocates all energy consumption to the final electrical product, providing a true measure of the plant's performance.\n\nFor dimensional consistency, the units of $c_i$ are given as $\\mathrm{kg\\,CO_2/GJ_{fuel}}$. Both $\\eta_{i,t}$ and $\\kappa_{i,t}$ are dimensionless quantities. Consequently, the derived expression for $\\phi_{i,t}$ has units of $\\mathrm{kg\\,CO_2/GJ}$. Since $\\eta_{i,t}$ relates fuel energy to electrical energy, the unit of energy in the denominator of $\\phi_{i,t}$ is gigajoules of electricity ($\\mathrm{GJ}_{elec}$). The problem requires the result in units of $\\mathrm{kg\\,CO_2/MWh}$. A conversion is therefore necessary.\nThe conversion factor between megawatt-hours ($\\mathrm{MWh}$) and gigajoules ($\\mathrm{GJ}$) is:\n$$ 1 \\, \\mathrm{MWh} = 1 \\times 10^6 \\, \\mathrm{W} \\cdot \\mathrm{h} = (1 \\times 10^6 \\, \\mathrm{J/s}) \\times (3600 \\, \\mathrm{s}) = 3.6 \\times 10^9 \\, \\mathrm{J} $$\nSince $1 \\, \\mathrm{GJ} = 10^9 \\, \\mathrm{J}$, it follows that $1 \\, \\mathrm{MWh} = 3.6 \\, \\mathrm{GJ}$. Thus, the conversion factor is $3.6 \\, \\mathrm{GJ/MWh}$.\nThe final formula for computation is:\n$$ \\phi_{i,t} \\, [\\mathrm{kg/MWh}] = \\left( \\frac{c_i (1 - \\kappa_{i,t})}{\\eta_{i,t}} \\right) [\\mathrm{kg/GJ}] \\times 3.6 \\, [\\mathrm{GJ/MWh}] $$\n\nNow, a numerical evaluation is performed using the provided parameters for the combined cycle natural gas generator: $c_i=56.1\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,CO_2/GJ}$, $\\eta_{i,t}=0.54$, and $\\kappa_{i,t}=0.85$.\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$$ \\phi_{i,t} = \\frac{56.1 \\cdot (1 - 0.85)}{0.54} \\times 3.6 $$\n$$ \\phi_{i,t} = \\frac{56.1 \\cdot 0.15}{0.54} \\times 3.6 $$\n$$ \\phi_{i,t} = \\frac{8.415}{0.54} \\times 3.6 $$\n$$ \\phi_{i,t} = 15.58\\overline{3} \\times 3.6 $$\n$$ \\phi_{i,t} = 56.1 $$\nThe calculation yields an exact value of $56.1$. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Therefore, the result is $56.10 \\, \\mathrm{kg\\,CO_2/MWh}$.",

Let the system-wide marginal emissions intensity at time $t$ be denoted by $\\gamma_{t}$, measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour (tCO$_2$/MWh). A single storage device performs one complete charge-discharge cycle that shifts energy from period $H$ to period $L$ (that is, it charges in period $H$ and discharges in period $L$). The storage device has a constant round-trip efficiency $\\eta_{\\text{rt}} \\in (0,1)$, defined as the ratio of electrical energy discharged to electrical energy charged over a cycle.\n\nUse the following fundamental principles:\n- Carbon accounting for the economy-wide carbon budget implies that the carbon cost of meeting load is the sum over time of the product of marginal emissions intensity and the generation needed to serve net load, that is, the change in total carbon emissions caused by any intervention that increases generation by $\\Delta G_{t}$ at time $t$ is $\\sum_{t}\\gamma_{t}\\Delta G_{t}$.\n- Conservation of energy for storage implies that if $C$ is the energy charged and $D$ is the energy discharged during a cycle, then $D = \\eta_{\\text{rt}}\\,C$.\n\nLet $D$ denote the electrical energy delivered by the storage device during period $L$, in megawatt-hours (MWh).

Analysis of the Charging Period ($H$)**\nDuring period $H$, the storage device charges, drawing an amount of energy $C$ from the grid. This additional energy consumption must be met by an increase in generation from the grid's power plants. Therefore, the change in generation during this period is an increase equal to the energy charged:\n$$\\Delta G_{H} = +C$$\n\n**2. Analysis of the Discharging Period ($L$)**\nDuring period $L$, the storage device discharges, supplying an amount of energy $D$ to the grid. This supplied energy serves a portion of the system load, thereby displacing or reducing the amount of generation required from the grid's power plants. Therefore, the change in generation during this period is a decrease equal to the energy discharged:\n$$\\Delta G_{L} = -D$$\n\n**3. Assembling the Net Emissions Expression**\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\Delta G_{H}$ and $\\Delta G_{L}$ into the net emissions equation gives:\n$$E^{\\text{net}} = \\gamma_{H}C - \\gamma_{L}D$$\nThis expression depends on both $C$ and $D$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a principled method to determine the feasibility of a cumulative carbon budget, $B$, under constraints on emissions reduction rates and minimum emission floors. A budget is considered feasible if there exists at least one sequence of emissions, $\\{E_t\\}_{t=1}^T$, that simultaneously satisfies all given constraints. This condition is equivalent to determining if the minimum possible cumulative emissions, subject to the constraints, is less than or equal to the budget $B$. We must therefore find the minimum value of the objective function $C_{total} = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} E_t$.\n\nThe system is defined over a discrete planning horizon $t \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, T\\}$. The decision variables are the emissions levels $E_t$ for each period $t$. The constraints governing these variables are:\n1.  **Ramp-rate constraint:** $E_t - E_{t-1} \\ge -r^{\\max}$, which can be rewritten as $E_t \\ge E_{t-1} - r^{\\max}$ for all $t \\in \\{1, \\dots, T\\}$.\n2.  **Emissions floor constraint:** $E_t \\ge L_t$ for all $t \\in \\{1, \\dots, T\\}$.\n3.  **Non-negativity constraint:** $E_t \\ge 0$ for all $t \\in \\{1, \\dots, T\\}$.\n\nThe problem statement specifies that the floor values are non-negative, $L_t \\ge 0$. Consequently, the floor constraint $E_t \\ge L_t$ implies that $E_t \\ge 0$, rendering the non-negativity constraint redundant. For any period $t$, the emissions $E_t$ must satisfy both the ramp-rate and floor constraints. The value of $E_t$ is therefore lower-bounded by the maximum of the two expressions:\n$$E_t \\ge \\max(E_{t-1} - r^{\\max}, L_t)$$\n\nTo minimize the total sum $C_{total} = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} E_t$, we must select the smallest permissible value for each individual term $E_t$. This observation suggests a greedy, recursive strategy to construct the optimal emissions pathway. Let us define a candidate sequence, denoted $\\{E_t^*\\}_{t=1}^T$, by choosing the lowest possible value for emissions at each time step, starting from the known initial state $E_0$.\n\nThe sequence $\\{E_t^*\\}$ is constructed via the following recurrence relation for $t \\in \\{1, \\dots, T\\}$:\n$$E_t^* = \\max(E_{t-1}^* - r^{\\max}, L_t)$$\nwhere we initialize the sequence with $E_0^* = E_0$. This construction defines a path of most rapid feasible emissions reduction.\n\nWe now demonstrate that this sequence $\\{E_t^*\\}$ indeed yields the minimum possible cumulative emissions, $C_{min}$. To do so, we prove by induction that for any other feasible emissions sequence $\\{E_t\\}$, it must hold that $E_t \\ge E_t^*$ for all $t \\in \\{1, \\dots, T\\}$.\n\n**Proof by Induction:**\n\n**Base Case ($t=1$):**\nFor any feasible sequence, the emissions in the first period, $E_1$, must satisfy $E_1 \\ge \\max(E_0 - r^{\\max}, L_1)$. By our construction, $E_1^* = \\max(E_0 - r^{\\max}, L_1)$. Therefore, it is immediate that $E_1 \\ge E_1^*$.\n\n**Inductive Hypothesis:**\nAssume that for some integer $k$ where $1 \\le k < T$, the inequality $E_k \\ge E_k^*$ holds for any feasible sequence $\\{E_t\\}$.\n\n**Inductive Step:**\nWe must show that $E_{k+1} \\ge E_{k+1}^*$. By definition, any feasible emissions level $E_{k+1}$ must satisfy the constraint:\n$$E_{k+1} \\ge \\max(E_k - r^{\\max}, L_{k+1})$$\nFrom the inductive hypothesis, we have $E_k \\ge E_k^*$, which implies $E_k - r^{\\max} \\ge E_k^* - r^{\\max}$. Since the $\\max$ function is monotonically non-decreasing in its arguments, it follows that:\n$$\\max(E_k - r^{\\max}, L_{k+1}) \\ge \\max(E_k^* - r^{\\max}, L_{k+1})$$\nThe right-hand side of this inequality is precisely the definition of $E_{k+1}^*$. Combining the inequalities, we obtain:\n$$E_{k+1} \\ge \\max(E_k - r^{\\max}, L_{k+1}) \\ge E_{k+1}^*$$\nThus, we have shown that $E_{k+1} \\ge E_{k+1}^*$.\n\nBy the principle of mathematical induction, we conclude that $E_t \\ge E_t^*$ for all $t \\in \\{1, \\dots, T\\}$. This proves that the sequence $\\{E_t^*\\}$ constitutes the point-wise minimum feasible emissions path.\n\nFrom this result, it follows directly that the sum of any feasible emissions sequence $\\{E_t\\}$ is bounded below by the sum of our constructed sequence $\\{E_t^*\\}$:\n$$\\sum_{t=1}^{T} E_t \\ge \\sum_{t=1}^{T} E_t^*$$\nTherefore, the minimum possible cumulative emissions is given by:\n$$C_{min} = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} E_t^*$$\n\nThe feasibility of the carbon budget $B$ hinges on the existence of at least one valid emissions pathway whose total emissions do not exceed $B$. Such a pathway exists if and only if the minimum possible total emissions, $C_{min}$, satisfy the budget constraint.\n\n**Feasibility Test:**\nThe budget $B$ is achievable if and only if:\n$$C_{min} \\le B$$\nThis provides a necessary and sufficient condition for feasibility.\n- **Sufficiency:** If $C_{min} \\le B$, then the constructed path $\\{E_t^*\\}$ is a valid and existing trajectory that satisfies the budget constraint.\n- **Necessity:** If $C_{min} > B$, then no feasible trajectory can meet the budget, as all such trajectories have cumulative emissions of at least $C_{min}$.\n\nThe principled method is therefore an algorithm that first constructs the minimal emissions sequence $\\{E_t^*\\}$ recursively, then calculates the total cumulative emissions $C_{min}$ by summing its elements, and finally compares this sum to the budget $B$ to determine feasibility.",
