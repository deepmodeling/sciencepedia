            "problem": "Consider an energy systems modeling context in which the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) is defined as the present value, in consumption units, of a marginal metric ton of carbon dioxide emissions’ damage stream. Assume a representative-agent social planner with constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) preferences, where instantaneous utility is $u(C)=\\frac{C^{1-\\eta}}{1-\\eta}$ for consumption $C$, elasticity of marginal utility of consumption $\\eta>0$, and a pure rate of time preference $\\rho>0$. Let consumption grow at a constant rate $g$, so that $C(t)=C_{0}\\exp(g t)$, and assume continuous-time aggregation of welfare with exponential discounting on utility.\n\nFrom these primitives, derive the planner’s consumption discount rate $r$ as a function of $\\rho$, $\\eta$, and $g$. Then, take $\\rho=1\\%$, $\\eta=2$, and $g=2\\%$ and compute $r$. Next, suppose productivity slows so that $g$ decreases to $1\\%$ while the damage path from a marginal metric ton of carbon dioxide is unchanged and is represented by a constant annual flow $D$ indefinitely. Under continuous discounting with a constant $r$, quantify the percentage change in the SCC when comparing the new state ($g=1\\%$) to the original state ($g=2\\%$), assuming damages remain identical in magnitude and timing except for the change in $g$ transmitted through $r$.\n\nExpress the discount rate $r$ in per year as a decimal, and express the SCC change as a fraction (do not use a percentage sign). No rounding is required unless necessary for clarity; if used, round any decimal representation to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the consumption discount rate, its calculation under specific parameters, and an analysis of the change in the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) when economic growth slows. We begin by validating the problem statement.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Utility Function**: $u(C)=\\frac{C^{1-\\eta}}{1-\\eta}$ for consumption $C$, where $\\eta > 0$ is the elasticity of marginal utility of consumption.\n- **Pure Rate of Time Preference**: $\\rho > 0$.\n- **Consumption Growth**: $C(t)=C_{0}\\exp(g t)$, where $g$ is the constant growth rate of consumption.\n- **Welfare Aggregation**: Continuous-time exponential discounting on utility.\n- **Original Parameters**: $\\rho=1\\%$, $\\eta=2$, $g=2\\%$.\n- **New Scenario Parameter**: $g$ decreases to $1\\%$.\n- **SCC Definition**: The present value of the damage stream from a marginal ton of carbon dioxide emissions.\n- **Damage Stream**: A constant annual flow $D$ indefinitely.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on the standard Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans growth model framework, a cornerstone of modern macroeconomics and environmental economics. The CRRA utility function, the derivation of the Ramsey discount rate, and the definition of the SCC as a present value of damages are all standard and well-established concepts. All necessary parameters are provided, and the problem structure is logical and internally consistent. There are no scientific flaws, ambiguities, or contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. We will proceed with a full solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Consumption Discount Rate ($r$)\nThe social planner evaluates streams of consumption over time by maximizing a social welfare function, $W$, which is the integral of discounted utility:\n$$W = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\rho t) u(C(t)) dt$$\nThe consumption discount rate, $r$, is the rate at which the social value of a marginal unit of consumption declines over time. The discount factor for consumption at time $t$ is the ratio of the discounted marginal utility at time $t$ to the marginal utility at time $0$.\n\nFirst, we find the marginal utility of consumption, $u'(C)$, by differentiating the utility function $u(C)$ with respect to $C$:\n$$u'(C) = \\frac{d}{dC} \\left( \\frac{C^{1-\\eta}}{1-\\eta} \\right) = (1-\\eta) \\frac{C^{1-\\eta-1}}{1-\\eta} = C^{-\\eta}$$\nThe marginal utility of consumption at time $t$ is $u'(C(t))$. Given $C(t) = C_{0}\\exp(g t)$, we have:\n$$u'(C(t)) = (C_{0}\\exp(g t))^{-\\eta} = C_{0}^{-\\eta} \\exp(-\\eta g t)$$\nAt time $t=0$, the marginal utility is $u'(C(0)) = C_{0}^{-\\eta}$.\n\nThe social discount factor, $SDF(t)$, for consumption at time $t$ is:\n$$SDF(t) = \\frac{\\exp(-\\rho t) u'(C(t))}{u'(C(0))} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\rho t) C_{0}^{-\\eta} \\exp(-\\eta g t)}{C_{0}^{-\\eta}}$$\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n$$SDF(t) = \\exp(-\\rho t) \\exp(-\\eta g t) = \\exp(-(\\rho + \\eta g) t)$$\nThe consumption discount rate $r$ is defined such that $SDF(t) = \\exp(-r t)$. By comparing the two expressions for $SDF(t)$, we identify the consumption discount rate as:\n$$r = \\rho + \\eta g$$\nThis is the Ramsey discounting rule.\n\n### Calculation of the Discount Rate for the Original State\nThe problem provides the following parameters for the original state:\n- $\\rho = 1\\% = 0.01$\n- $\\eta = 2$\n- $g_{1} = 2\\% = 0.02$\n\nUsing the derived formula for $r$, the discount rate in the original state, denoted as $r_1$, is:\n$$r_1 = \\rho + \\eta g_{1} = 0.01 + 2 \\times 0.02 = 0.01 + 0.04 = 0.05$$\nSo, the discount rate is $0.05$ per year.\n\n### Analysis of the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC)\nThe SCC is the present value of the perpetual damage stream $D$, discounted at the consumption discount rate $r$. In a continuous-time framework, this is calculated by the integral:\n$$SCC = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} D \\exp(-r t) dt$$\nAssuming $r > 0$, this integral evaluates to:\n$$SCC = D \\left[ -\\frac{1}{r} \\exp(-r t) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = D \\left( \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\left(-\\frac{1}{r} \\exp(-r t)\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{r} \\exp(-r \\cdot 0)\\right) \\right)$$\n$$SCC = D \\left( 0 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{r}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{D}{r}$$\nThis shows that the SCC is inversely proportional to the discount rate $r$.\n\n### Calculation of the Percentage Change in SCC\nWe need to compare the SCC in two states: an original state (State 1) and a new state with lower growth (State 2).\n\n**State 1 (Original):**\n- Growth rate: $g_1 = 0.02$\n- Discount rate: $r_1 = 0.05$\n- SCC: $SCC_1 = \\frac{D}{r_1} = \\frac{D}{0.05}$\n\n**State 2 (New):**\nProductivity slows, and the consumption growth rate decreases to $g_2 = 1\\% = 0.01$. The parameters $\\rho = 0.01$ and $\\eta = 2$ remain unchanged.\n- The new discount rate, $r_2$, is:\n$$r_2 = \\rho + \\eta g_2 = 0.01 + 2 \\times 0.01 = 0.01 + 0.02 = 0.03$$\n- The new SCC, assuming the damage path $D$ is unchanged, is:\n$$SCC_2 = \\frac{D}{r_2} = \\frac{D}{0.03}$$\n\nThe percentage change in the SCC from State 1 to State 2 is calculated as $\\frac{SCC_2 - SCC_1}{SCC_1}$. The problem asks for this change to be expressed as a fraction.\n$$\\text{Fractional Change} = \\frac{SCC_2 - SCC_1}{SCC_1} = \\frac{SCC_2}{SCC_1} - 1$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $SCC_1$ and $SCC_2$:\n$$\\text{Fractional Change} = \\frac{D/r_2}{D/r_1} - 1 = \\frac{r_1}{r_2} - 1$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values for $r_1$ and $r_2$:\n$$\\text{Fractional Change} = \\frac{0.05}{0.03} - 1 = \\frac{5}{3} - 1 = \\frac{5 - 3}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\nThe slowdown in economic growth from $2\\%$ to $1\\%$ leads to a lower discount rate ($3\\%$ instead of $5\\%$), which in turn places a higher present value on future damages. This results in a positive change (an increase) in the SCC, specifically an increase of $\\frac{2}{3}$ or approximately $66.7\\%$.\n\nThe two results requested are the original discount rate $r_1$ and the fractional change in the SCC.\n1. The discount rate $r$ (for $g=2\\%$) is $0.05$.\n2. The fractional change in the SCC is $\\frac{2}{3}$.",

            "problem": "An energy planning team is evaluating how to represent climate externalities in an optimization model. The team wants to distinguish between the marginal Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) and the average damage per ton associated with a large change in emissions. The Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) is defined as the marginal present value of climate damages with respect to an incremental unit of emissions at the current baseline. The average damage per ton associated with a large change in emissions is defined as the total present value change in damages divided by the total change in emissions.\n\nConsider a stylized, reduced-form representation in which the present value of climate damages, denoted by $V(G)$, depends on a scalar measure of cumulative emissions $G$ over the relevant horizon.
