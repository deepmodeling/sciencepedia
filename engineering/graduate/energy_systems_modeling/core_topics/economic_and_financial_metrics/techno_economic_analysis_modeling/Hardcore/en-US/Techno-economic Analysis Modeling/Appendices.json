            "problem": "In techno-economic analysis (TEA) within energy systems modeling, a standard investment appraisal relies on the time value of money and absence of arbitrage in competitive capital markets. Consider a deterministic project that yields an annual cash flow stream $\\{ C_{t} \\}_{t=0}^{4}$ with $C_{0}=-1000$, $C_{1}=200$, $C_{2}=300$, $C_{3}=400$, and $C_{4}=500$. Assume annual compounding and a constant, risk-adjusted real discount rate $r=0.06$, reflecting the opportunity cost of capital under certainty-equivalent valuation. Starting from first principles consistent with no-arbitrage pricing and intertemporal budget balance, derive the expression for the present value at $t=0$ of a finite deterministic cash flow stream with annual compounding. Then compute the present value for the given cash flows and rate, and explain, using the net present value decision rule grounded in welfare/imputed-wealth maximization, how the sign of the computed present value would guide an invest-or-defer decision. Round your final numerical answer to four significant figures. Express the final value in the same monetary units as the cash flows (do not include units in the final boxed answer).",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of financial mathematics and techno-economic analysis, well-posed with a complete and consistent set of data, and objective in its formulation.\n\nThe derivation of the present value of a finite deterministic cash flow stream begins from the first principle of the time value of money, which posits that a unit of currency today is worth more than the same unit in the future. This is due to the opportunity cost of capital; money held today can be invested to earn a return. In a market with a constant, risk-free (or risk-adjusted) rate of return $r$ per period, a principal amount $V_t$ at time $t$ will grow to a future value $V_{t+1}$ at time $t+1$ according to the relation:\n$$V_{t+1} = V_t (1+r)$$\nThis is the principle of compounding. Conversely, to find the equivalent value of a future cash flow at an earlier time, we must perform discounting. The present value $PV$ at time $t$ of a cash flow $C_{t+1}$ received at time $t+1$ is:\n$$PV(C_{t+1}) = \\frac{C_{t+1}}{1+r}$$\nThis process can be iteratively applied. The present value at time $t=0$ of a cash flow $C_t$ received at a future time period $t$ requires discounting over $t$ periods. For annual compounding, this relationship is:\n$$PV(C_t) = \\frac{C_t}{(1+r)^t}$$\nThis formula is predicated on the principle of no-arbitrage, a cornerstone of financial theory. It ensures that the present value of the future cash flow is exactly the amount that, if invested today at the rate $r$, would grow to equal $C_t$ at time $t$. Any other valuation would allow for arbitrage, i.e., the generation of a risk-free profit.\n\nThe total present value of a finite stream of cash flows $\\{C_t\\}_{t=0}^{N}$ is the sum of the present values of each individual cash flow. This sum is formally known as the Net Present Value (NPV), as it nets the present value of all inflows against all outflows. The general expression is:\n$$PV = \\sum_{t=0}^{N} \\frac{C_t}{(1+r)^t}$$\nThe cash flow at time $t=0$, $C_0$, is already in present terms, so its discounting factor is $(1+r)^0 = 1$. It typically represents the initial investment and is therefore negative.\n\nFor the given problem, the cash flow stream is $\\{ C_{t} \\}_{t=0}^{4}$, with values $C_0=-1000$, $C_1=200$, $C_2=300$, $C_3=400$, and $C_4=500$. The constant, risk-adjusted real discount rate is $r=0.06$. The time horizon is $N=4$ years.\n\nWe apply the derived formula to compute the present value for the given cash flows:\n$$PV = C_0 + \\frac{C_1}{(1+r)^1} + \\frac{C_2}{(1+r)^2} + \\frac{C_3}{(1+r)^3} + \\frac{C_4}{(1+r)^4}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$PV = -1000 + \\frac{200}{1+0.06} + \\frac{300}{(1+0.06)^2} + \\frac{400}{(1+0.06)^3} + \\frac{500}{(1+0.06)^4}$$\n$$PV = -1000 + \\frac{200}{1.06} + \\frac{300}{1.06^2} + \\frac{400}{1.06^3} + \\frac{500}{1.06^4}$$\nNow, we calculate each term:\nThe present value of $C_1$ is $\\frac{200}{1.06} \\approx 188.6792$.\nThe present value of $C_2$ is $\\frac{300}{1.1236} \\approx 266.9989$.\nThe present value of $C_3$ is $\\frac{400}{1.191016} \\approx 335.8475$.\nThe present value of $C_4$ is $\\frac{500}{1.26247696} \\approx 396.0467$.\n\nSumming these values with the initial investment:\n$$PV \\approx -1000 + 188.6792 + 266.9989 + 335.8475 + 396.0467$$\n$$PV \\approx -1000 + 1187.5723$$\n$$PV \\approx 187.5723$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final numerical answer to four significant figures. The calculated value is $187.5723...$. The first four significant figures are $1$, $8$, $7$, and $5$. The fifth significant figure is $7$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth significant figure.\n$$PV \\approx 187.6$$\n\nThe Net Present Value (NPV) decision rule is a direct application of the principle of welfare or imputed-wealth maximization. The NPV represents the net gain in wealth, measured in today's currency, that an investor accrues by undertaking the project. The discount rate $r$ represents the opportunity cost of capital—the return achievable from an alternative investment of equivalent risk in the capital market.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item If $NPV  0$: The project generates a return exceeding its opportunity cost of capital. Accepting the project increases the investor's wealth by the amount of the NPV. The rational decision is to **invest**. In this case, since $PV \\approx 187.6  0$, the project should be accepted.\n    \\item If $NPV  0$: The project's return is less than the opportunity cost of capital. Accepting it would result in a net loss of wealth compared to the alternative market investment. The rational decision is to **reject** the project.\n    \\item If $NPV = 0$: The project's return is exactly equal to the opportunity cost of capital. The investor would be theoretically indifferent between investing in the project and investing in the market. It adds no net wealth. In practice, such projects are often rejected due to unquantified risks or transaction costs.\n\\end{itemize}\nThus, the sign of the computed present value directly guides the invest-or-defer decision. A positive sign indicates an increase in imputed wealth, justifying the investment.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for a project with a given series of cash flows, and an investment decision based on the Net Present Value (NPV) at two specified discount rates.\n\nThe Present Value (PV) of a cash flow $C_t$ occurring at time $t$ with a discount rate $r$ is given by $\\mathrm{PV}(C_t) = \\frac{C_t}{(1+r)^t}$. The Net Present Value (NPV) of a project is the sum of the present values of all its cash flows. For the given project with cash flows $C_0$, $C_1$, and $C_2$ at times $t=0$, $t=1$, and $t=2$ respectively, the NPV is:\n$$ \\mathrm{NPV}(r) = C_0 + \\frac{C_1}{1+r} + \\frac{C_2}{(1+r)^2} $$\nThe cash flows are given as $C_0 = -1000$, $C_1 = 500$, and $C_2 = 700$. Substituting these values into the NPV equation gives:\n$$ \\mathrm{NPV}(r) = -1000 + \\frac{500}{1+r} + \\frac{700}{(1+r)^2} $$\nThe Internal Rate of Return, denoted as $r^{\\ast}$, is defined as the discount rate at which the NPV of the project is equal to zero.\n$$ \\mathrm{NPV}(r^{\\ast}) = -1000 + \\frac{500}{1+r^{\\ast}} + \\frac{700}{(1+r^{\\ast})^2} = 0 $$\nTo solve for $r^{\\ast}$, we can define a variable $y = 1+r^{\\ast}$. The equation becomes:\n$$ -1000 + \\frac{500}{y} + \\frac{700}{y^2} = 0 $$\nAssuming $y \\neq 0$ (which implies $r^{\\ast} \\neq -1$, a necessary condition for a meaningful economic rate), we can multiply the entire equation by $y^2$ to clear the denominators, resulting in a quadratic equation in terms of $y$:\n$$ -1000y^2 + 500y + 700 = 0 $$\nDividing the equation by $-100$ simplifies it to:\n$$ 10y^2 - 5y - 7 = 0 $$\nThis is a standard quadratic equation of the form $ay^2 + by + c = 0$, with coefficients $a = 10$, $b = -5$, and $c = -7$. We use the quadratic formula to find the roots for $y$:\n$$ y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$\nSubstituting the coefficients:\n$$ y = \\frac{-(-5) \\pm \\sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4(10)(-7)}}{2(10)} = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 + 280}}{20} = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{305}}{20} $$\nSince $y = 1+r^{\\ast}$, and for any conventional investment project we are interested in a rate $r^{\\ast}  -1$, it follows that $y$ must be positive ($y  0$). The square root of $305$ is approximately $17.46$, so $\\sqrt{305}  5$. This means the root $\\frac{5 - \\sqrt{305}}{20}$ is negative, while the root $\\frac{5 + \\sqrt{305}}{20}$ is positive.
