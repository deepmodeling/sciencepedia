The tasks are to find the time to travel between two points. This is a well-defined mathematical problem.

There are no contradictions.\n5.  **Realistic**: The parameters describe a physically possible scenario, even if the cooling system is insufficient to lower the temperature, which is a realistic situation.\n6.  **Ill-Posed**: The problem is not ill-posed. It leads to a unique and meaningful solution for each part, even if one solution is infinite.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed to solve it.\n\nThe energy balance for the single-zone thermal model is given by:\n$$\nC \\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = \\frac{T_a - T(t)}{R} + s(t)\\gamma\n$$\nwhere $s(t)$ is a binary control variable, with $s(t)=0$ when the cooling device is off and $s(t)=1$ when it is on.\nThis equation can be rearranged into the standard form of a first-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dT(t)}{dt} + \\frac{1}{RC} T(t) = \\frac{T_a}{RC} + \\frac{s(t)\\gamma}{C}\n$$\nLet the thermal time constant be $\\tau_c = RC$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dT(t)}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_c} T(t) = \\frac{T_a}{\\tau_c} + \\frac{s(t)\\gamma}{C}\n$$\nThe steady-state temperature, $T_{\\infty}$, is found by setting $\\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = 0$:\n$$\nT_{\\infty} = T_a + s(t)R\\gamma\n$$\nThe general solution to this differential equation for a constant $s$ and an initial temperature $T(0)$ is:\n$$\nT(t) = T_{\\infty} + (T(0) - T_{\\infty})\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_c}\\right)\n$$\nWe analyze the two required scenarios separately.\n\n**Part 1: Time to hit the upper threshold (device off)**\n\nIn this case, the device is off, so $s(t)=0$. The initial condition is $T(0) = T^{\\mathrm{set}}$.\nThe steady-state temperature is $T_{\\infty, \\text{off}} = T_a + 0 \\cdot R\\gamma = T_a$.\nThe temperature trajectory is:\n$$\nT(t) = T_a + (T^{\\mathrm{set}} - T_a)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{RC}\\right)\n$$\nWe need to find the time $t_1$ at which the temperature reaches the upper threshold, $T(t_1) = T^{\\mathrm{u}}$.\n$$\nT^{\\mathrm{u}} = T_a + (T^{\\mathrm{set}} - T_a)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_1}{RC}\\right)\n$$\nSolving for $t_1$:\n$$\n\\frac{T^{\\mathrm{u}} - T_a}{T^{\\mathrm{set}} - T_a} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_1}{RC}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{t_1}{RC} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{T^{\\mathrm{u}} - T_a}{T^{\\mathrm{set}} - T_a}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nt_1 = -RC \\ln\\left(\\frac{T^{\\mathrm{u}} - T_a}{T^{\\mathrm{set}} - T_a}\\right) = RC \\ln\\left(\\frac{T^{\\mathrm{set}} - T_a}{T^{\\mathrm{u}} - T_a}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $T^{\\mathrm{set}} = 24$, $\\Delta = 1$, $C = 2$, $R = 3$, and $T_a = 30$.\nThe upper threshold is $T^{\\mathrm{u}} = T^{\\mathrm{set}} + \\Delta = 24 + 1 = 25$.\nThe thermal time constant is $RC = 3 \\times 2 = 6$ hours.\nThe time $t_1$ is:\n$$\nt_1 = 6 \\ln\\left(\\frac{24 - 30}{25 - 30}\\right) = 6 \\ln\\left(\\frac{-6}{-5}\\right) = 6 \\ln(1.2)\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\nt_1 \\approx 6 \\times 0.182321556... \\approx 1.09392934...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $t_1 = 1.094$ hours.\n\n**Part 2: Time to hit the lower threshold (device on)**\n\nIn this case, the device is on, so $s(t)=1$. The process starts when the temperature hits $T^{\\mathrm{u}}$, so the initial condition for this phase is $T(0) = T^{\\mathrm{u}}$.\nThe steady-state temperature is $T_{\\infty, \\text{on}} = T_a + R\\gamma$.\nThe temperature trajectory is:\n$$\nT(t) = T_{\\infty, \\text{on}} + (T^{\\mathrm{u}} - T_{\\infty, \\text{on}})\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{RC}\\right)\n$$\nWe need to find the time $t_2$ at which the temperature reaches the lower threshold, $T(t_2) = T^{\\ell}$.\n\nLet's first analyze the physics by calculating the relevant temperatures.\nThe temperature band is $[T^{\\ell}, T^{\\mathrm{u}}] = [T^{\\mathrm{set}} - \\Delta, T^{\\mathrm{set}} + \\Delta] = [24 - 1, 24 + 1] = [23, 25]$.\nThe initial temperature for this cycle is $T(0) = T^{\\mathrm{u}} = 25$.\nThe steady-state temperature is $T_{\\infty, \\text{on}} = T_a + R\\gamma = 30 + 3(-0.5) = 30 - 1.5 = 28.5$.\nThe system's temperature evolves from its initial state, $T(0)=25$, towards its steady-state or equilibrium temperature, $T_{\\infty, \\text{on}} = 28.5$.\nSince the initial temperature ($25$) is lower than the equilibrium temperature ($28.5$), the temperature $T(t)$ will monotonically increase over time, asymptotically approaching $28.5$.\nThe target temperature is the lower threshold, $T^{\\ell} = 23$.\nBecause the temperature is always increasing from $25$ and will always be greater than or equal to $25$ for $t \\ge 0$, it can never reach the lower value of $23$.\nTherefore, the time $t_2$ to reach $T^{\\ell}$ is infinite.\n\nTo confirm this mathematically, we can attempt to solve for $t_2$:\n$$\nT^{\\ell} = T_{\\infty, \\text{on}} + (T^{\\mathrm{u}} - T_{\\infty, \\text{on}})\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_2}{RC}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nt_2 = -RC \\ln\\left(\\frac{T^{\\ell} - T_{\\infty, \\text{on}}}{T^{\\mathrm{u}} - T_{\\infty, \\text{on}}}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\nt_2 = -6 \\ln\\left(\\frac{23 - 28.5}{25 - 28.5}\\right) = -6 \\ln\\left(\\frac{-5.5}{-3.5}\\right) = -6 \\ln\\left(\\frac{11}{7}\\right)\n$$\nSince $\\frac{11}{7}  1$, its natural logarithm $\\ln(\\frac{11}{7})$ is a positive number.\nThus, $t_2$ is a negative number:\n$$\nt_2 \\approx -6 \\times 0.45198... \\approx -2.7119...\n$$\nA negative time is not a physically valid solution for a future-directed process. This confirms that the target temperature $T^{\\ell}$ is not reached in forward time. The time to reach this state is therefore infinite.\n\nThe computed times are:\n1. $t_1 \\approx 1.094$ hours.\n2. $t_2 \\rightarrow \\infty$.",

During this period, the indoor temperature of each device evolves according to the first-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = \\frac{T_a - T(t)}{\\tau}\n$$\nThis equation describes heating due to the temperature difference with the exterior.

According to the definition of a Bernoulli random variable with success probability $p$:\nThe probability mass function is $\\mathbb{P}(Z_{i,k} = 1) = p$ and $\\mathbb{P}(Z_{i,k} = 0) = 1-p$.\n\nThe expectation of $Z_{i,k}$ is, by definition:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Z_{i,k}] = (1) \\cdot \\mathbb{P}(Z_{i,k} = 1) + (0) \\cdot \\mathbb{P}(Z_{i,k} = 0) = 1 \\cdot p + 0 \\cdot (1-p) = p\n$$\n\nThe variance of $Z_{i,k}$ is, by definition, $\\mathrm{Var}(Z_{i,k}) = \\mathbb{E}[Z_{i,k}^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[Z_{i,k}])^2$.\nTo find $\\mathbb{E}[Z_{i,k}^2]$, we observe that since $Z_{i,k}$ can only take values $0$ or $1$, the variable $Z_{i,k}^2$ is identical to $Z_{i,k}$. That is, $0^2 = 0$ and $1^2 = 1$.\nTherefore, $\\mathbb{E}[Z_{i,k}^2] = \\mathbb{E}[Z_{i,k}] = p$.\nSubstituting this into the variance formula:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(Z_{i,k}) = \\mathbb{E}[Z_{i,k}^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[Z_{i,k}])^2 = p - p^2 = p(1-p)\n$$\n\nNow we can proceed to find the expectation and variance of the aggregate power $P^{\\mathrm{agg}}_{k}$.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Expected Aggregate Power $\\mathbb{E}[P^{\\mathrm{agg}}_{k}]$**\n\nThe expectation of a sum of random variables is the sum of their expectations. This property is known as the linearity of expectation.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[P^{\\mathrm{agg}}_{k}] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\sum_{i=1}^{N} u_{i,k} \\, \\bar{P}_{i} \\, Z_{i,k} \\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathbb{E}[u_{i,k} \\, \\bar{P}_{i} \\, Z_{i,k}]\n$$\nSince $u_{i,k}$ and $\\bar{P}_{i}$ are deterministic constants for each device $i$ at time $k$, they can be factored out of the expectation operator:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[P^{\\mathrm{agg}}_{k}] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} u_{i,k} \\, \\bar{P}_{i} \\, \\mathbb{E}[Z_{i,k}]\n$$\nWe have already derived that $\\mathbb{E}[Z_{i,k}] = p$. Since this holds for all $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$, we can substitute this result into the expression:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[P^{\\mathrm{agg}}_{k}] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} u_{i,k} \\, \\bar{P}_{i} \\, p\n$$\nThe probability $p$ is a common factor for all terms in the summation, so it can be factored out:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[P^{\\mathrm{agg}}_{k}] = p \\sum_{i=1}^{N} u_{i,k} \\, \\bar{P}_{i}\n$$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the expected aggregate power. It represents the intended aggregate power command, scaled by the probability of successful communication.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Variance of Aggregate Power $\\mathrm{Var}(P^{\\mathrm{agg}}_{k})$**\n\nThe aggregate power $P^{\\mathrm{agg}}_{k}$ is a sum of the terms $X_i = u_{i,k} \\bar{P}_{i} Z_{i,k}$. Since the random variables $\\{Z_{i,k}\\}_{i=1}^{N}$ are mutually independent and the coefficients $\\{u_{i,k} \\bar{P}_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{N}$ are constants, the terms $\\{X_i\\}_{i=1}^{N}$ are also mutually independent random variables.\nFor a sum of independent random variables, the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(P^{\\mathrm{agg}}_{k}) = \\mathrm{Var}\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N} u_{i,k} \\, \\bar{P}_{i} \\, Z_{i,k} \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathrm{Var}(u_{i,k} \\, \\bar{P}_{i} \\, Z_{i,k})\n$$\nUsing the variance property $\\mathrm{Var}(c X) = c^2 \\mathrm{Var}(X)$ for a constant $c$, we identify $c = u_{i,k} \\bar{P}_{i}$ and $X = Z_{i,k}$. Applying this property yields:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(P^{\\mathrm{agg}}_{k}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (u_{i,k} \\bar{P}_{i})^2 \\, \\mathrm{Var}(Z_{i,k})\n$$\nWe have already derived that $\\mathrm{Var}(Z_{i,k}) = p(1-p)$. This is the same for all devices. Substituting this result:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(P^{\\mathrm{agg}}_{k}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (u_{i,k} \\bar{P}_{i})^2 \\, p(1-p)\n$$\nThe term $p(1-p)$ is a common factor and can be moved outside the summation:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(P^{\\mathrm{agg}}_{k}) = p(1-p) \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (u_{i,k} \\bar{P}_{i})^2 = p(1-p) \\sum_{i=1}^{N} u_{i,k}^2 \\bar{P}_{i}^2\n$$\nThe control command $u_{i,k}$ is binary, belonging to the set $\\{0, 1\\}$. Therefore, $u_{i,k}^2 = u_{i,k}$ because $0^2=0$ and $1^2=1$. We can simplify the expression accordingly:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(P^{\\mathrm{agg}}_{k}) = p(1-p) \\sum_{i=1}^{N} u_{i,k} \\bar{P}_{i}^2\n$$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the variance of the aggregate power. It quantifies the uncertainty in the aggregate response due to communication failures. The variance is zero if $p=0$ or $p=1$, as the outcome would be deterministic in those cases. The variance is maximized when $p=0.5$, which corresponds to the highest uncertainty in communication success for each device.",
