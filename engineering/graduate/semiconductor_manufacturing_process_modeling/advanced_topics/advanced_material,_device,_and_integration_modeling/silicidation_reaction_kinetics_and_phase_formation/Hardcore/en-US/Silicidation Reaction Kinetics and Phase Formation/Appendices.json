The provided data, including thermodynamic quantities, physical properties, and process conditions, are consistent and realistic within the context of materials science and semiconductor processing. The question is logically structured, requiring the derivation and application of a thermodynamic principle followed by a validation step using compositional analysis and phase diagram information. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution is warranted.\n\nThe problem requires us to determine which of three candidate silicide phases, $\\mathrm{MSi_{2}}$, $\\mathrm{MSi}$, or $\\mathrm{M_{5}Si_{3}}$, has the largest thermodynamic driving force to nucleate first at a pure silicon interface. This is determined by minimizing the change in Gibbs free energy of the system. The formation of a general silicide phase $\\mathrm{M_{x}Si_{y}}$ from its pure constituent elements can be represented by the reaction:\n$$x\\mathrm{M} + y\\mathrm{Si} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{M_{x}Si_{y}}$$\nThe molar Gibbs energy of formation for this reaction is given as $\\Delta G_{f,\\mathrm{M_{x}Si_{y}}}(T)$. This value represents the energy change per mole of the product, $\\mathrm{M_{x}Si_{y}}$, that is formed.\n\nTo compare the propensity of different phases to nucleate at the silicon interface, it is necessary to normalize the driving force to a common basis. The most physically relevant basis for nucleation at the $M$–$\\mathrm{Si}$ interface, from the perspective of the silicon substrate, is the consumption of one mole of silicon. The effective molar driving force for nucleation per mole of silicon consumed, which we shall denote as $\\Delta G'_{\\mathrm{M_{x}Si_{y}}}$, is obtained by dividing the molar Gibbs energy of formation by the number of moles of silicon in the formula unit, $y$:\n$$ \\Delta G'_{\\mathrm{M_{x}Si_{y}}} = \\frac{\\Delta G_{f,\\mathrm{M_{x}Si_{y}}}(T)}{y} $$\nThe phase with the most negative value of $\\Delta G'_{\\mathrm{M_{x}Si_{y}}}$ will have the largest magnitude thermodynamic driving force to nucleate first.

Therefore, based on the principle of minimizing the Gibbs free energy, $\\mathrm{MSi_{2}}$ is the phase with the largest thermodynamic driving force for nucleation at the silicon interface.\n\nNext, we validate this prediction using the overall composition of the reaction zone and the provided phase diagram information.\nFirst, we calculate the number of moles of metal ($n_M$) and silicon ($n_{Si}$) in the specified reaction volume.\nThe thicknesses must be converted to $\\mathrm{cm}$:\n$t_{M} = 10\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n$t_{\\mathrm{Si}} = 30\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n\nThe volume of each material for the given area $A = 1\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ is $V = A \\times t$:\n$V_{M} = (1\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2})(1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{cm}) = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{3}$\n$V_{\\mathrm{Si}} = (1\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2})(3.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{cm}) = 3.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{3}$\n\nUsing the given densities, we find the mass of each component:\n$m_{M} = \\rho_{M} V_{M} = (7.5\\,\\mathrm{g/cm^{3}})(1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{3}) = 7.5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{g}$\n$m_{\\mathrm{Si}} = \\rho_{\\mathrm{Si}} V_{\\mathrm{Si}} = (2.33\\,\\mathrm{g/cm^{3}})(3.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{3}) = 6.99 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{g}$\n\nUsing the molar masses, we find the number of moles:\n$n_{M} = \\frac{m_{M}}{M_{M}} = \\frac{7.5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{g}}{60\\,\\mathrm{g/mol}} = 1.25 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{mol}$\n$n_{\\mathrm{Si}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{Si}}}{M_{\\mathrm{Si}}} = \\frac{6.99 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{g}}{28.0855\\,\\mathrm{g/mol}} \\approx 2.4889 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{mol}$\n\nThe overall atomic fraction of silicon, $X_{\\mathrm{Si}}$, in the reaction zone is:\n$$ X_{\\mathrm{Si}} = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{Si}}}{n_{M} + n_{\\mathrm{Si}}} = \\frac{2.4889 \\times 10^{-7}}{1.25 \\times 10^{-7} + 2.4889 \\times 10^{-7}} = \\frac{2.4889}{3.7389} \\approx 0.6656 $$\nThe stoichiometric composition of $\\mathrm{MSi_{2}}$ is $X_{\\mathrm{Si}} = 2 / (1+2) = 2/3 \\approx 0.6667$. The calculated overall composition of the available reactants is extremely close to the stoichiometry of the $\\mathrm{MSi_{2}}$ phase.\n\nThe problem states that the phase diagram shows a tie-line connecting pure $\\mathrm{Si}$ and $\\mathrm{MSi_{2}}$ at $T_{\\mathrm{ann}}$. This signifies that an interface between $\\mathrm{Si}$ and $\\mathrm{MSi_{2}}$ is thermodynamically stable at this temperature. Conversely, the absence of tie-lines connecting $\\mathrm{Si}$ to $\\mathrm{MSi}$ or $\\mathrm{M_{5}Si_{3}}$ implies that interfaces between these phases and silicon are unstable and would react to form $\\mathrm{MSi_{2}}$. Therefore, the prediction from the effective driving force calculation—that $\\mathrm{MSi_{2}}$ nucleates first—is consistent with the thermodynamic stability of interfaces dictated by the equilibrium phase diagram.\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum value of the effective molar driving force per mole of silicon consumed among the three candidates. This corresponds to the algebraically smallest value among $\\{-81, -71, -62\\}\\,\\mathrm{kJ/mol}$, which is $-81\\,\\mathrm{kJ/mol}$. Rounding to four significant figures is requested.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the Avrami exponent, $n$, from in situ sheet resistance measurements during the isothermal formation of nickel monosilicide ($\\mathrm{NiSi}$). The solution will proceed in three stages: first, establishing the relationship between the measured sheet resistance $R_s(t)$ and the transformed phase fraction $X(t)$; second, deriving the formula to extract $n$ from the kinetic data; and third, applying this formula to the provided data points and verifying the result against independent measurements.\n\nFirst, we formalize the relationship between sheet resistance and phase fraction. The problem states that $R_s(t)$ varies affinely between the initial value $R_{s,i}$ at time $t=0$ (where $X=0$) and the final value $R_{s,f}$ at full transformation (where $X=1$). This is described by a lever-rule linear effective medium model. A simple linear interpolation between the two states, weighted by the fraction of the transformed phase $X(t)$, is given by:\n$$R_s(t) = R_{s,i}(1 - X(t)) + R_{s,f}X(t)$$\nThis equation satisfies the boundary conditions: at $t=0$, $X(0)=0$ and $R_s(0)=R_{s,i}$; for $t \\to \\infty$, $X(\\infty)=1$ and $R_s(\\infty)=R_{s,f}$. We can rearrange this expression to solve for the transformed fraction $X(t)$ in terms of the measurable sheet resistances:\n$$R_s(t) = R_{s,i} - R_{s,i}X(t) + R_{s,f}X(t)$$\n$$R_s(t) - R_{s,i} = (R_{s,f} - R_{s,i})X(t)$$\n$$X(t) = \\frac{R_s(t) - R_{s,i}}{R_{s,f} - R_{s,i}} = \\frac{R_{s,i} - R_s(t)}{R_{s,i} - R_{s,f}}$$\n\nSecond, we incorporate the Johnson–Mehl–Avrami–Kolmogorov (JMAK) kinetic model for isothermal phase transformations. The model describes the transformed fraction $X(t)$ as a function of time $t$:\n$$X(t) = 1 - \\exp(-kt^n)$$\nwhere $k$ is the temperature-dependent rate constant and $n$ is the Avrami exponent. To extract the exponent $n$, we linearize this equation. Rearranging the JMAK equation yields:\n$$1 - X(t) = \\exp(-kt^n)$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln(1 - X(t)) = -kt^n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm again after rearranging:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1 - X(t)}\\right) = kt^n$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1 - X(t)}\\right)\\right) = \\ln(k t^n) = \\ln(k) + n\\ln(t)$$\nThis final expression is in the form of a linear equation $Y = C + mZ$, where $Y = \\ln(\\ln(1/(1-X)))$, $Z = \\ln(t)$, the slope is the Avrami exponent $m=n$, and the intercept is $C=\\ln(k)$. Given two data points $(t_1, X_1)$ and $(t_2, X_2)$, the slope $n$ can be calculated as:\n$$n = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1 - X(t_2)}\\right)\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1 - X(t_1)}\\right)\\right)}{\\ln(t_2) - \\ln(t_1)}$$\n\nThird, we apply this method to the experimental data.

The mole fraction of nickel, $x_{\\text{Ni}}$, varies linearly, so the gradient $\\frac{dx_{\\text{Ni}}}{dx}$ is constant:\n$$\\frac{dx_{\\text{Ni}}}{dx} = \\frac{x_{\\text{Ni}}(L) - x_{\\text{Ni}}(0)}{L - 0} = \\frac{0.45 - 0.55}{1.5 \\times 10^{-7} \\ \\mathrm{m}} = -\\frac{0.10}{1.5 \\times 10^{-7} \\ \\mathrm{m}} \\approx -6.667 \\times 10^5 \\ \\mathrm{m^{-1}}$$\nThe difference in intrinsic diffusion coefficients is:\n$$D_{\\text{Ni}} - D_{\\text{Si}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s} - 2.0 \\times 10^{-21} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s} = 1.98 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}$$\nNow we calculate the Kirkendall velocity, $v_K$:\n$$v_K = (1.98 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}) \\times (-6.667 \\times 10^5 \\ \\mathrm{m^{-1}}) \\approx -1.32 \\times 10^{-13} \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$$\nThe total shift of the markers, $\\Delta x_K$, after an annealing time $t = 7.200 \\times 10^{3} \\ \\mathrm{s}$ is:\n$$\\Delta x_K = v_K \\times t = (-1.32 \\times 10^{-13} \\ \\mathrm{m/s}) \\times (7.200 \\times 10^{3} \\ \\mathrm{s}) = -9.504 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\mathrm{m}$$\nThe problem asks for the answer in nanometers ($\\mathrm{nm}$), where $1 \\ \\mathrm{nm} = 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n$$\\Delta x_K = -0.9504 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives:\n$$\\Delta x_K \\approx -0.950 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$$\nFinally, we deduce the dominant diffusing species. The velocity is given by $v_K = (D_{\\text{Ni}} - D_{\\text{Si}}) \\frac{dx_{\\text{Ni}}}{dx}$. Since $D_{\\text{Ni}} \\gg D_{\\text{Si}}$, the term $(D_{\\text{Ni}} - D_{\\text{Si}})$ is positive. The gradient $\\frac{dx_{\\text{Ni}}}{dx}$ is negative. The product is negative, resulting in a negative velocity and shift toward the Ni side. This occurs because the faster diffusion of Ni atoms into the silicide is balanced by a lattice shift in the opposite direction. Therefore, Nickel (Ni) is the dominant diffusing species.",
