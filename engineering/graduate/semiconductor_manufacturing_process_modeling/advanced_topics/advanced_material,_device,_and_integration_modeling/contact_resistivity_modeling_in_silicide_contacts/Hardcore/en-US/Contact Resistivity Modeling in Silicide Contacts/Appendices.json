            "problem": "A silicide contact formed on a doped semiconductor is modeled by a two-dimensional conductive sheet with sheet resistance $R_{\\mathrm{sh}}$ and a finite specific contact resistivity $\\rho_c$ at the metal–semiconductor interface. The specific contact resistivity $\\rho_c$ is defined by the local boundary relation $J_z = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{int}}}{\\rho_c}$, where $J_z$ is the normal current density crossing the interface and $V_{\\mathrm{int}}$ is the voltage drop across the interface; $\\rho_c$ has units of $\\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^2$. In-plane current in the sheet obeys charge conservation $\\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{J}=0$ and Ohm’s law $\\mathbf{J} = -\\sigma \\nabla V$, with sheet conductance related to sheet resistance by $R_{\\mathrm{sh}} = 1/\\sigma_{\\mathrm{sheet}}$ expressed in $\\Omega/\\square$. Under the transmission line approximation, current crowding near the contact perimeter introduces a characteristic transfer length $L_T$ that emerges from the coupling of in-plane sheet conduction and vertical interfacial conduction.\n\nYou are asked to extract $\\rho_c$ using three canonical test structures and associated measurement data. Your program must implement physically consistent models based on the fundamental laws stated above and produce numerically stable estimates. All quantities below are specified in the centimeter–gram–second system where lengths are given in $\\mathrm{cm}$ and resistances in $\\Omega$.\n\nTask A: Rectangular Transmission Line Model (TLM) bar.\n- A rectangular bar of width $W$ hosts a linear array of identical rectangular contacts of length $L_c$ with $L_c \\gg L_T$. Two-terminal resistances between adjacent contact pairs are measured as a function of the center-to-center spacing $s$. Under one-dimensional in-plane current flow along the bar between contacts, the total measured resistance between two contacts can be modeled as a sum of two contact-end resistances and a sheet resistance contribution that scales linearly with $s$.\n- Given $W = 1.0\\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{cm}$, and measured spacings $s \\in \\{0,\\ 5.0\\times 10^{-4},\\ 1.0\\times 10^{-3},\\ 1.5\\times 10^{-3},\\ 2.0\\times 10^{-3}\\}\\ \\mathrm{cm}$ with corresponding measured two-terminal resistances $R_{\\mathrm{meas}} \\in \\{1.788854382,\\ 41.788854382,\\ 81.788854382,\\ 121.788854382,\\ 161.788854382\\}\\ \\Omega$, estimate $\\rho_c$ by fitting the linear relation between $R_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ and $s$ and using the appropriate large-contact-length limit relation that connects the extracted contact-end resistance, the sheet resistance, and $\\rho_c$.\n\nTask B: Cox–Strack circular transmission line structure (CS).\n- A coaxial circular test structure consists of an inner circular contact of radius $a$ and an outer concentric ring contact of outer radius $b$. With $a$ fixed and $b$ varied, radial current flows in the sheet between the contacts with a logarithmic dependence on the ratio $b/a$, and the total measured resistance is a sum of perimeter-dominated contact resistances and the radial sheet term.\n- Given a fixed inner radius $a = 5.0\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{cm}$ and outer radii $b \\in \\{1.0\\times 10^{-3},\\ 1.5\\times 10^{-3},\\ 2.5\\times 10^{-3}\\}\\ \\mathrm{cm}$, the corresponding measured two-terminal resistances are $R_{\\mathrm{meas}} \\in \\{9.397784676,\\ 14.545613716,\\ 21.050925708\\}\\ \\Omega$. Estimate $\\rho_c$ by fitting the linear dependence of the total resistance on $\\ln(b/a)$ to extract $R_{\\mathrm{sh}}$ and the per-contact resistance at the inner perimeter, and then relate the perimeter-dominated contact resistance to $\\rho_c$.\n\nTask C: Four-terminal Kelvin contact extraction (Kelvin).\n- A four-terminal Kelvin measurement isolates the contact-end resistance of a single rectangular contact of width $W$ and finite length $L_c$ bonded to a conductive sheet of known $R_{\\mathrm{sh}}$. For finite $L_c$, the contact-end resistance depends nonlinearly on the transfer length $L_T$ and thus on $\\rho_c$. Use the transmission line boundary-value relation between the Kelvin contact-end resistance, $W$, $L_c$, and $R_{\\mathrm{sh}}$ to infer $\\rho_c$ by solving the resulting nonlinear equation.\n- Given $W = 1.0\\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{cm}$, $L_c = 1.0\\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{cm}$, known sheet resistance $R_{\\mathrm{sh}} = 80.0\\ \\Omega/\\square$, and a measured Kelvin per-contact resistance $R_c^{(\\mathrm{Kelvin})} = 1.286026010\\ \\Omega$, solve for $\\rho_c$.\n\nNumerical and output requirements:\n- For all tasks, express the final specific contact resistivity $\\rho_c$ in $\\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^2$.\n- Your program must implement least-squares linear regression where appropriate and a robust root-finding procedure for the nonlinear Kelvin inversion. Use physically consistent modeling that emerges from the stated fundamental base without invoking unrelated shortcut formulas.\n- Test Suite:\n  1. Task A dataset as specified above.\n  2.

            "solution": "The user has provided a multipart problem to determine the specific contact resistivity, $\\rho_c$, from measurements on three different semiconductor test structures. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains sufficient information for a solution. I will address each task by first deriving the relevant physical model from the fundamental principles stated, and then applying the provided data to extract the parameter of interest. All calculations will be performed in the CGS unit system as specified.\n\nThe fundamental model is the one-dimensional transmission line model (TLM). For a conductive sheet with sheet resistance $R_{\\mathrm{sh}}$ (in $\\Omega/\\square$) beneath a contact of width $W$, the voltage $V(x)$ in the sheet along the direction of current flow $x$ obeys the differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} - \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{sh}}}{\\rho_c} V(x) = 0\n$$\nThis is a direct consequence of Ohm's law for the sheet ($\\mathbf{J} = -\\sigma_{\\mathrm{sheet}} \\nabla V$, with $R_{\\mathrm{sh}}=1/\\sigma_{\\mathrm{sheet}}$) and the boundary condition for vertical current density at the interface ($J_z = V/\\rho_c$). The equation is commonly written as:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} - \\frac{1}{L_T^2} V(x) = 0\n$$\nwhere $L_T = \\sqrt{\\rho_c / R_{\\mathrm{sh}}}$ is the characteristic transfer length.\n\n### Task A: Rectangular Transmission Line Model (TLM)\n\nIn a TLM structure, the total two-terminal resistance $R_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ between two adjacent contacts separated by a gap of length $s$ is modeled as the sum of the resistance of the semiconductor sheet between the contacts and the resistances at each of the two contacts.\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{meas}}(s) = R_{\\mathrm{sheet}}(s) + 2R_c\n$$\nThe resistance of the gap is $R_{\\mathrm{sheet}}(s) = R_{\\mathrm{sh}} \\frac{s}{W}$. The contact-end resistance, $R_c$, for a contact of length $L_c$ is derived from the TLM equation and is given by $R_c = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{sh}} L_T}{W} \\coth\\left(\\frac{L_c}{L_T}\\right)$. The problem specifies the long-contact limit, $L_c \\gg L_T$, for which $\\coth(L_c/L_T) \\to 1$. Thus, the contact resistance simplifies to:\n$$\nR_c \\approx \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{sh}} L_T}{W} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\rho_c R_{\\mathrm{sh}}}}{W}\n$$\nThe total measured resistance is therefore a linear function of the spacing $s$:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{meas}}(s) = \\left(\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{sh}}}{W}\\right) s + 2 R_c\n$$\nWe perform a linear least-squares fit on the provided data ($s_i, R_{\\mathrm{meas}, i}$) to this model, $y = mx + b$.\nThe slope of the fit is $m = R_{\\mathrm{sh}}/W$.\nThe y-intercept of the fit is $b = 2R_c$.\n\nFrom the fit, we can extract the physical parameters:\n$1$. $R_{\\mathrm{sh}} = m \\cdot W$\n$2$. $R_c = b/2$\nBy substituting these into the expression for $R_c$, we can solve for $\\rho_c$:\n$$\n\\frac{b}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\rho_c (mW)}}{W} \\implies \\left(\\frac{b}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\rho_c m W}{W^2} = \\frac{\\rho_c m}{W}\n$$\n$$\n\\rho_c = \\frac{W b^2}{4m}\n$$\nThe given data is $W = 1.0\\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{cm}$, $s \\in \\{0, 5\\times 10^{-4}, 1\\times 10^{-3}, 1.5\\times 10^{-3}, 2\\times 10^{-3}\\}\\ \\mathrm{cm}$, and $R_{\\mathrm{meas}} \\in \\{1.788854382, 41.788854382, 81.788854382, 121.788854382, 161.788854382\\}\\ \\Omega$. A linear regression will be applied to this data.\n\n### Task B: Cox–Strack Circular Transmission Line Structure\n\nFor the circular TLM structure, current flows radially outward from an inner contact of radius $a$ to an outer contact of radius $b$. The resistance is modeled as a linear function of $\\ln(b/a)$, as specified. The governing equation for radial current flow leads to a solution involving modified Bessel functions, but a common simplified model for the total resistance $R_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ is:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{meas}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{sh}}}{2\\pi} \\ln\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right) + R_{\\mathrm{contacts}}\n$$\nwhere $R_{\\mathrm{contacts}}$ represents the total contribution from contact resistances. To solve this, we fit the data to a line $y = mx+C$, where $y=R_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ and $x = \\ln(b/a)$.\nThe slope is $m = R_{\\mathrm{sh}}/(2\\pi)$, from which we find $R_{\\mathrm{sh}} = 2\\pi m$.\n\nThe interpretation of the intercept $C$ is crucial. A common approximation, which we adopt as per the problem's implicit structure, relates the x-axis intercept of this plot to the transfer length. The simplified model is $R_{\\mathrm{meas}} \\approx \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{sh}}}{2\\pi} \\left( \\ln(b/a) + L_T/a \\right)$ (ignoring the $L_T/b$ term, which is a reasonable approximation if $b \\gg a$). The x-intercept ($R_{\\mathrm{meas}}=0$) is at $\\ln(b/a) = -L_T/a$. From the linear fit, the x-intercept is $-C/m$. Equating these gives:\n$$\n-\\frac{L_T}{a} = -\\frac{C}{m} \\implies L_T = \\frac{aC}{m}\n$$\nUsing the definition of $L_T = \\sqrt{\\rho_c/R_{\\mathrm{sh}}}$, we can solve for $\\rho_c$:\n$$\n\\rho_c = L_T^2 R_{\\mathrm{sh}} = \\left(\\frac{aC}{m}\\right)^2 (2\\pi m) = \\frac{2\\pi a^2 C^2}{m}\n$$\nThe given data is $a = 5.0\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{cm}$, $b \\in \\{1.0\\times 10^{-3}, 1.5\\times 10^{-3}, 2.5\\times 10^{-3}\\}\\ \\mathrm{cm}$, and $R_{\\mathrm{meas}} \\in \\{9.397784676, 14.545613716, 21.050925708\\}\\ \\Omega$. A linear regression will be performed on $R_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ versus $\\ln(b/a)$.\n\n### Task C: Four-terminal Kelvin Contact\n\nThe four-terminal Kelvin measurement is designed to isolate the \"contact-end resistance\" of a single finite-length contact. The problem specifies using the transmission line boundary-value relation for this resistance, which is the expression for $R_c$ derived for Task A, but without a large-length approximation:\n$$\nR_c^{(\\mathrm{Kelvin})} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{sh}} L_T}{W} \\coth\\left(\\frac{L_c}{L_T}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting $L_T = \\sqrt{\\rho_c/R_{\\mathrm{sh}}}$, we obtain a nonlinear equation for $\\rho_c$:\n$$\nR_c^{(\\mathrm{Kelvin})} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{sh}}}{W} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho_c}{R_{\\mathrm{sh}}}} \\coth\\left(\\frac{L_c}{\\sqrt{\\rho_c/R_{\\mathrm{sh}}}}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\rho_c R_{\\mathrm{sh}}}}{W} \\coth\\left(L_c \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{sh}}}{\\rho_c}}\\right)\n$$\nWe are given all other parameters: $W = 1.0\\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{cm}$, $L_c = 1.0\\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{cm}$, $R_{\\mathrm{sh}} = 80.0\\ \\Omega/\\square$, and $R_c^{(\\mathrm{Kelvin})} = 1.286026010\\ \\Omega$. This constitutes a root-finding problem for $\\rho_c$. We define a function $f(\\rho_c)$:\n$$\nf(\\rho_c) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\rho_c R_{\\mathrm{sh}}}}{W} \\coth\\left(L_c \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{sh}}}{\\rho_c}}\\right) - R_c^{(\\mathrm{Kelvin})}\n$$\nWe must find the root $\\rho_c$ such that $f(\\rho_c) = 0$. The function $\\coth(x)$ and the overall expression are monotonic, ensuring a unique positive solution. A robust numerical root-finding algorithm, such as the Brent-Dekker method, will be employed.\n\nThe implementation will consist of three functions, one for each task, followed by a main routine to execute them and format the results as specified.",

A Transmission Line Method (TLM) structure is formed by two such contacts separated by a gap $L$. The two-terminal resistance between the two probe pads attached to the contacts is measured for several values of $L$, and a linear fit of total resistance versus $L$ is performed. Each probe pad introduces a series parasitic resistance $R_{\\mathrm{pad}}$ between the instrument and the corresponding silicide contact.

            "solution": "The problem statement describes a standard two-terminal Transmission Line Method (TLM) measurement, including parasitic pad resistances. All provided definitions, assumptions, and parameters are consistent with established semiconductor device physics and characterization techniques. The physical model is scientifically sound, well-posed, and all terms are objectively defined. The numerical values provided are physically realistic. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nWe will now derive the required expressions from first principles.\n\nLet $x$ be the coordinate along the length of the semiconductor strip. Consider a differential segment $dx$ of the semiconductor region under one of the metal contacts. Let $V(x)$ be the potential in the semiconductor sheet and $I_x(x)$ be the current flowing in the sheet at position $x$. The metal contact is held at a uniform potential $V_m$.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, we have two governing relations:\n1. One-dimensional Ohm's law for the current in the semiconductor sheet:\nThe electric field is $E_x = -\\frac{dV}{dx}$. The sheet current density is $J_x = \\sigma_s E_x = -\\sigma_s \\frac{dV}{dx}$. The total current is $I_x = J_x \\cdot t \\cdot W$, where $t$ is the thickness of the conducting layer. The sheet resistance is $R_{\\mathrm{sh}} = 1/(\\sigma_s t)$. Thus, the current is related to the voltage gradient by $I_x(x) = -\\frac{W}{R_{\\mathrm{sh}}} \\frac{dV}{dx}$. This can be written as $\\frac{dV}{dx} = -I_x \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{sh}}}{W} = -I_x r$, where $r = R_{\\mathrm{sh}}/W$ is the resistance per unit length of the semiconductor strip.\n\n2. Local normal conduction at the contact interface:\nThe current density flowing vertically from the semiconductor to the metal is $J_z = \\frac{V(x) - V_m}{\\rho_c}$. The current leaving the semiconductor sheet into the contact over the differential length $dx$ is $dI_z = J_z \\cdot (W dx) = \\frac{W}{\\rho_c}(V(x) - V_m)dx$.\nBy Kirchhoff's current law, this must equal the decrease in the sheet current $I_x$ over the segment $dx$. So, $-dI_x = dI_z$.\nThis gives $\\frac{dI_x}{dx} = -\\frac{W}{\\rho_c}(V(x) - V_m) = -g(V(x) - V_m)$, where $g = W/\\rho_c$ is the conductance per unit length of the interface.\n\nTo find the potential distribution, we combine these two equations. Differentiating the first equation with respect to $x$ gives $\\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} = -r \\frac{dI_x}{dx}$.\nSubstituting the expression for $\\frac{dI_x}{dx}$ gives:\n$$ \\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} = -r \\left( -g(V(x) - V_m) \\right) = rg(V(x) - V_m) $$\nWe define the characteristic transfer length $L_T$ as:\n$$ L_T = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{rg}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{(R_{\\mathrm{sh}}/W)(W/\\rho_c)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho_c}{R_{\\mathrm{sh}}}} $$\nThe differential equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} = \\frac{V(x) - V_m}{L_T^2} $$\nThe general solution is $V(x) = A e^{x/L_T} + B e^{-x/L_T} + V_m$.\n\nThe problem states that the contact length is large compared to the transfer length, which we model as an infinitely long contact. Let the contact start at $x=0$ and extend to $x \\to \\infty$. The current $I_0$ is injected into the contact at $x=0$. Far into the contact ($x \\to \\infty$), the current in the semiconductor sheet must decay to zero, $I_x(\\infty) = 0$.\nThe current is $I_x(x) = -\\frac{1}{r} \\frac{dV}{dx} = -\\frac{1}{r L_T} (A e^{x/L_T} - B e^{-x/L_T})$.\nFor $I_x(\\infty) = 0$, the coefficient $A$ must be zero.\nSo, the potential and current are:\n$$ V(x) = B e^{-x/L_T} + V_m $$\n$$ I_x(x) = \\frac{B}{r L_T} e^{-x/L_T} $$\nThe contact resistance $R_C$ for one contact is defined as the potential difference at the point of injection ($x=0$) divided by the total current injected, $I_x(0)$.\n$$ R_C = \\frac{V(0) - V_m}{I_x(0)} = \\frac{B e^0}{(B/(rL_T))e^0} = r L_T $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $r$ and $L_T$:\n$$ R_C = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{sh}}}{W} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho_c}{R_{\\mathrm{sh}}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{R_{\\mathrm{sh}} \\rho_c}}{W} $$\nA TLM structure consists of two such contacts separated by a gap of length $L$. The total measured two-terminal resistance $R_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ is the sum of all series resistances: two probe pad resistances, two contact resistances, and the resistance of the semiconductor gap.\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{meas}}(L) = R_{\\mathrm{pad,1}} + R_{C,1} + R_{\\mathrm{gap}} + R_{C,2} + R_{\\mathrm{pad,2}} $$\nGiven that the pads and contacts are identical:\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{meas}}(L) = 2R_{\\mathrm{pad}} + 2R_C + R_{\\mathrm{gap}} $$\nThe resistance of the semiconductor gap is $R_{\\mathrm{gap}} = R_{\\mathrm{sh}} \\frac{L}{W}$.\nSo, the total measured resistance as a function of $L$ is:\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{meas}}(L) = \\left(\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{sh}}}{W}\\right) L + 2 R_{\\mathrm{pad}} + \\frac{2\\sqrt{R_{\\mathrm{sh}} \\rho_c}}{W} $$\nThis is a linear equation in $L$. A linear fit of $R_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ versus $L$ has a slope $m = R_{\\mathrm{sh}}/W$ and a y-intercept $B_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ at $L=0$.\nThe intercept is:\n$$ B_{\\mathrm{meas}} = 2 R_{\\mathrm{pad}} + 2 R_C = 2 R_{\\mathrm{pad}} + \\frac{2\\sqrt{R_{\\mathrm{sh}} \\rho_c}}{W} $$\nThe parasitic pad resistance $R_{\\mathrm{pad}}$ adds a term of $2R_{\\mathrm{pad}}$ to the intercept value. To find the true contact properties, this parasitic contribution must be subtracted.\n\nNow, we use the provided experimental data to compute $\\rho_c$.\nThe given values are:\n- Sheet resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{sh}} = 800 \\ \\Omega/\\square$\n- Strip width, $W = 2 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} = 2 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{cm}$\n- Parasitic pad resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{pad}} = 5 \\ \\Omega$\n- Measured intercept, $B_{\\mathrm{meas}} = 38.28 \\ \\Omega$\n\nFirst, we find the total true contact resistance $2R_C$ by subtracting the total pad resistance from the measured intercept:\n$$ 2R_C = B_{\\mathrm{meas}} - 2R_{\\mathrm{pad}} = 38.28 \\ \\Omega - 2 \\cdot (5 \\ \\Omega) = 28.28 \\ \\Omega $$\nFrom this, the resistance of a single contact is $R_C = 14.14 \\ \\Omega$.\n\nNow we use the expression for $R_C$ to solve for the specific contact resistivity $\\rho_c$:\n$$ R_C = \\frac{\\sqrt{R_{\\mathrm{sh}} \\rho_c}}{W} $$\nRearranging for $\\rho_c$:\n$$ R_C W = \\sqrt{R_{\\mathrm{sh}} \\rho_c} $$\n$$ (R_C W)^2 = R_{\\mathrm{sh}} \\rho_c $$\n$$ \\rho_c = \\frac{(R_C W)^2}{R_{\\mathrm{sh}}} $$\nWe will perform the calculation using the values in units of $\\Omega$ and $\\mathrm{cm}$ to match the options.\n$$ \\rho_c = \\frac{(14.14 \\ \\Omega \\cdot 2 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{cm})^2}{800 \\ \\Omega} $$\n$$ \\rho_c = \\frac{(2.828 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{cm})^2}{800 \\ \\Omega} $$\n$$ \\rho_c = \\frac{7.997584 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\Omega^2 \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^2}{800 \\ \\Omega} $$\n$$ \\rho_c = 9.99698 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^2 $$\nRounding this result to a reasonable number of significant figures (three, based on the input data) gives:\n$$ \\rho_c \\approx 1.00 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^2 $$\n\nWe now evaluate each option.\n\nA. $1.00 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^2$\nOur derived value is $9.997 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^2$, which is equivalent to $0.9997 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^2$. This value, when rounded, is precisely $1.00 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^2$. The minor difference is due to the finite precision of the supplied intercept value $B_{\\mathrm{meas}}$. A reverse calculation starting with $\\rho_c=1.00 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^2$ yields $2R_C = \\frac{2\\sqrt{800 \\cdot 10^{-8}}}{2 \\times 10^{-4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{8 \\times 10^{-6}}}{10^{-4}} = 10\\sqrt{8} \\approx 28.284 \\ \\Omega$. This corresponds to a measured intercept of $B_{\\mathrm{meas}} = 10 + 28.284 = 38.284 \\ \\Omega$, which matches the given value of $38.28 \\ \\Omega$ very closely.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. $1.83 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^2$\nThis value would be obtained if one neglected to subtract the parasitic pad resistance $2R_{\\mathrm{pad}}$ from the intercept. In that case, one would incorrectly assume $2R_C = B_{\\mathrm{meas}} = 38.28 \\ \\Omega$, meaning $R_C = 19.14 \\ \\Omega$.\nCalculating $\\rho_c$ with this erroneous $R_C$:\n$$ \\rho_c = \\frac{(19.14 \\ \\Omega \\cdot 2 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{cm})^2}{800 \\ \\Omega} = \\frac{(3.828 \\times 10^{-3})^2}{800} \\ \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^2 \\approx 1.83 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^2 $$\nThis matches the option, but is based on an incorrect application of the model.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. $8.00 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^2$\nThis value is $0.800 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^2$. Our calculated value is approximately $1.00 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^2$. The values are different by $20\\%$. This option likely arises from a calculation error. For instance, if one used $28.00 \\ \\Omega$ instead of $28.28 \\ \\Omega$ for $2R_C$, that would give $R_C=14.00 \\ \\Omega$ and $\\rho_c = (14.00 \\cdot 2\\mathrm{e}-4)^2/800 = 9.8 \\times 10^{-9} \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^2$. This is still not $8.00 \\times 10^{-9}$. A different error must be responsible. Regardless, it does not match the result of the correct derivation.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. $1.00 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^2$\nThis value is a factor of $10$ smaller than the correct answer. This would typically result from a decimal place error during calculation, for example, misinterpreting the powers of $10$ in the final step of the division. As shown in the derivation, the correct value is $\\approx 10.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^2$, not $1.00 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^2$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. $1.00 \\times 10^{-7} \\ \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^2$\nThis value is a factor of $10$ larger than the correct answer. This could also arise from a decimal place error, or possibly an error in the units of $W$ (e.g., using $W=2 \\times 10^{-3.5} \\ \\mathrm{cm}$).

This exercise guides you through building a more sophisticated, physically-grounded model that accounts for the geometric realities of nanoscale contacts. You will learn to partition the total resistance into components arising from the interface area, the perimeter, the corners, and 3D current spreading in the bulk silicon, providing a powerful tool for predicting contact performance in advanced technologies .",

            "problem": "You are given a rectangular silicide contact to a doped silicon substrate. The goal is to construct a physically consistent model for the effective small-signal contact resistance, incorporating both area and perimeter contributions to interface conduction and three-dimensional (3D) bulk spreading in the semiconductor. You must then implement this model in a program and evaluate it for a defined test suite. All final numerical answers must be expressed in ohms, rounded to six decimal places.\n\nStart from the following fundamental base and definitions:\n\n- Ohm's law in differential form: the current density obeys $J = \\sigma E$, where $J$ is the current density, $\\sigma$ is the electrical conductivity, and $E$ is the electric field.\n- For a small applied voltage $V$ across the metal-silicon interface, the interfacial current response is linear. Define an areal specific conductance $g_A$ (in Siemens per square centimeter) such that the incremental current through an infinitesimal interface area element $dA$ is $dI_A = g_A V \\, dA$, which integrates to an areal interface conductance that scales with the total contact area.\n- Near the contact edges, Schottky barrier lowering and geometric field concentration enhance conduction. Model this by defining a perimeter-specific line conductance $g_P$ (in Siemens per centimeter) so that the incremental current through an infinitesimal edge length element $d\\ell$ is $dI_P = g_P V \\, d\\ell$, which integrates to a perimeter conductance that scales with the total contact perimeter.\n- Corners further concentrate the field. Model corners by an effective additional line-equivalent length per corner $l_c$ (in centimeters) and an edge enhancement factor $\\alpha$ (dimensionless). With $n_c$ corners, the corner conduction contributes an additional conductance equal to $g_P \\, n_c \\, l_c \\, \\alpha$.\n- In the semiconductor bulk, three-dimensional current spreading from the contact into a semi-infinite medium produces a series resistance. For a circular contact of radius $a$ on a semi-infinite half-space of resistivity $\\rho_s$ (in ohm-centimeter), the spreading resistance is $R_{\\mathrm{spread}} = \\dfrac{\\rho_s}{2 a}$, a well-tested result derived from Laplacian current flow in a homogeneous conductor. For a rectangular contact of area $A$, map to an equal-area circle with equivalent radius $a_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\sqrt{A / \\pi}$.\n\nUsing these bases, derive and implement a model for the total effective small-signal contact resistance $R_{\\mathrm{total}}$ as a function of the contact width $W$ and length $L$ (both in micrometers), areal specific conductance $g_A$ (in Siemens per square centimeter), perimeter-specific conductance $g_P$ (in Siemens per centimeter), corner effective length $l_c$ (in nanometers), corner enhancement factor $\\alpha$ (dimensionless), and semiconductor resistivity $\\rho_s$ (in ohm-centimeter).

Each tuple is $(W, L, g_A, g_P, \\rho_s, l_c, \\alpha)$ with geometry in micrometers, conductances in their stated units, resistivity in ohm-centimeter, corner length in nanometers, and dimensionless enhancement factor:\n\n- Case $1$ (happy path): $(0.5, 0.5, 2 \\times 10^{5}, 1 \\times 10^{2}, 1 \\times 10^{-3}, 10, 3.0)$.\n- Case $2$ (area-dominated large square): $(5.0, 5.0, 2 \\times 10^{5}, 5 \\times 10^{1}, 1 \\times 10^{-3}, 10, 2.0)$.\n- Case $3$ (perimeter-dominated tiny square): $(0.05, 0.05, 5 \\times 10^{4}, 2 \\times 10^{2}, 1 \\times 10^{-3}, 15, 4.0)$.\n- Case $4$ (narrow, long line contact with low bulk resistivity): $(0.05, 5.0, 1 \\times 10^{5}, 1.5 \\times 10^{2}, 1 \\times 10^{-4}, 15, 3.0)$.\n- Case $5$ (spreading-dominated due to high bulk resistivity): $(0.5, 0.5, 1 \\times 10^{5}, 1 \\times 10^{2}, 1 \\times 10^{-1}, 10, 3.0)$.\n- Case $6$ (edge case with very small area): $(0.02, 0.02, 1 \\times 10^{5}, 3 \\times 10^{2}, 1 \\times 10^{-3}, 10, 5.0)$.\n\nAll outputs must be in ohms and rounded to six decimal places.

            "solution": "The problem requires the formulation and implementation of a model for the total effective small-signal resistance of a rectangular silicide contact on a doped silicon substrate. The model must be grounded in the provided physical principles and definitions.\n\nThe total resistance, denoted $R_{\\mathrm{total}}$, is conceptualized as a series combination of two components: the resistance associated with current crossing the metal-silicon interface, $R_{\\mathrm{int}}$, and the resistance associated with current spreading into the bulk semiconductor, $R_{\\mathrm{spread}}$. The electrical circuit model is thus two resistors in series, and their resistances add:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{total}} = R_{\\mathrm{int}} + R_{\\mathrm{spread}}$$\n\nWe will derive the expressions for $R_{\\mathrm{int}}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{spread}}$ systematically. For all calculations, a consistent system of units is required. We will convert all geometric inputs to centimeters (cm) to match the units of the provided physical parameters. The required conversions are $1 \\, \\mathrm{\\mu m} = 10^{-4} \\, \\mathrm{cm}$ and $1 \\, \\mathrm{nm} = 10^{-7} \\, \\mathrm{cm}$. Let $W$ and $L$ be the contact width and length. Their values in cm are $W_{\\mathrm{cm}} = W_{\\mathrm{\\mu m}} \\times 10^{-4}$ and $L_{\\mathrm{cm}} = L_{\\mathrm{\\mu m}} \\times 10^{-4}$.\n\nFirst, we model the interface resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{int}}$. The problem states that current crosses the interface through three parallel conduction pathways: one proportional to the contact area, one to the perimeter, and one associated with the corners. For parallel conductors, their conductances add. The total interface conductance, $G_{\\mathrm{int}}$, is therefore the sum of the areal conductance ($G_A$), the perimeter conductance ($G_P$), and the corner conductance ($G_c$).\n$$G_{\\mathrm{int}} = G_A + G_P + G_c$$\nThe interface resistance is the reciprocal of this total conductance:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{int}} = \\frac{1}{G_{\\mathrm{int}}}$$\n\nThe individual conductance components are derived as follows:\n1.  **Areal Conductance ($G_A$)**: The problem defines an areal specific conductance $g_A$ (in S/cm$^2$). The total conductance from this mechanism is the specific conductance multiplied by the contact area, $A$. For a rectangular contact, $A = W_{\\mathrm{cm}} \\times L_{\\mathrm{cm}}$.\n    $$G_A = g_A \\cdot A$$\n\n2.  **Perimeter Conductance ($G_P$)**: A perimeter-specific line conductance $g_P$ (in S/cm) is defined. The total conductance from this mechanism is the specific line conductance multiplied by the contact perimeter, $P$. For a rectangle, $P = 2(W_{\\mathrm{cm}} + L_{\\mathrm{cm}})$.\n    $$G_P = g_P \\cdot P$$\n\n3.  **Corner Conductance ($G_c$)**: The corners are stated to provide an additional conductance given by the expression $g_P \\, n_c \\, l_c \\, \\alpha$, where $n_c$ is the number of corners (given as $n_c=4$ for a rectangle), $l_c$ is an effective line-equivalent length per corner, and $\\alpha$ is a dimensionless enhancement factor. We must convert $l_c$ from nanometers to centimeters: $l_{c, \\mathrm{cm}} = l_{c, \\mathrm{nm}} \\times 10^{-7}$.\n    $$G_c = g_P \\cdot n_c \\cdot l_{c, \\mathrm{cm}} \\cdot \\alpha$$\n\nCombining these terms, the total interface conductance is:\n$$G_{\\mathrm{int}} = g_A A + g_P P + g_P n_c l_{c, \\mathrm{cm}} \\alpha = g_A A + g_P (P + n_c l_{c, \\mathrm{cm}} \\alpha)$$\nAnd the interface resistance is:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{int}} = \\frac{1}{g_A (W_{\\mathrm{cm}} L_{\\mathrm{cm}}) + g_P (2(W_{\\mathrm{cm}} + L_{\\mathrm{cm}}) + 4 l_{c, \\mathrm{cm}} \\alpha)}$$\n\nNext, we model the spreading resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{spread}}$. This resistance arises from the current spreading from the finite contact area into the semi-infinite bulk of the semiconductor. The problem provides the formula for a circular contact of radius $a$ on a semi-infinite substrate with resistivity $\\rho_s$:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{spread}} = \\frac{\\rho_s}{2a}$$\nTo apply this to our rectangular contact, we use the specified equal-area approximation. We find the radius $a_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ of a circle that has the same area $A$ as the rectangle.\n$$A = \\pi a_{\\mathrm{eq}}^2 \\implies a_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{A}{\\pi}}$$\nSubstituting this equivalent radius into the spreading resistance formula gives:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{spread}} = \\frac{\\rho_s}{2 \\sqrt{A/\\pi}} = \\frac{\\rho_s \\sqrt{\\pi}}{2 \\sqrt{A}} = \\frac{\\rho_s \\sqrt{\\pi}}{2 \\sqrt{W_{\\mathrm{cm}} L_{\\mathrm{cm}}}}$$\n\nFinally, the total effective resistance $R_{\\mathrm{total}}$ is the sum of the interface and spreading resistances.\n$$R_{\\mathrm{total}} = R_{\\mathrm{int}} + R_{\\mathrm{spread}} = \\frac{1}{g_A A + g_P (P + n_c l_{c, \\mathrm{cm}} \\alpha)} + \\frac{\\rho_s \\sqrt{\\pi}}{2 \\sqrt{A}}$$\nThis complete expression can now be implemented to evaluate the resistance for the given test cases, ensuring all parameters are expressed in consistent units (S, cm, $\\Omega$) before calculation.",
