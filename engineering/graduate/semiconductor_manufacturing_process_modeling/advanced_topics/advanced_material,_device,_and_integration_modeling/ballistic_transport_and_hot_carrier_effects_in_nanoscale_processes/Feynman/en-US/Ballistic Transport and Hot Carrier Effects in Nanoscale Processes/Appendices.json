            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the steady-state electron drift velocity from the Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE), its numerical evaluation, the calculation of the electron mean free path, and a discussion on the validity of the model for a short channel.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the steady-state drift velocity, $v_{d}$. The semiclassical BTE describes the evolution of the distribution function $f(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{k}, t)$ of charge carriers in phase space. Its general form is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{k}) \\cdot \\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}} f + \\frac{\\mathbf{F}}{\\hbar} \\cdot \\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} f = \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} \\right)_{\\text{coll}}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{r}$ is the position, $\\mathbf{k}$ is the wavevector, $t$ is time, $\\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{k})$ is the group velocity, $\\mathbf{F}$ is the external force, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and the right-hand side represents the change in $f$ due to collisions.\n\nThe problem specifies several simplifying conditions:\n1.  Steady state: $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} = 0$.\n2.  Spatial homogeneity (uniform doping and field): $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}} f = 0$.\n3.  The external force on an electron of charge $-q$ in a uniform electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ is $\\mathbf{F} = -q\\mathbf{E}$.\n4.  The relaxation-time approximation for momentum is used for the collision term, which implies that collisions drive the system towards the equilibrium distribution $f_0$ with a characteristic time $\\tau$:\n    $$\n    \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} \\right)_{\\text{coll}} = -\\frac{f - f_0}{\\tau}\n    $$\nUnder these conditions, the BTE simplifies to:\n$$\n-\\frac{q\\mathbf{E}}{\\hbar} \\cdot \\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} f = -\\frac{f - f_0}{\\tau}\n$$\nInstead of solving this equation for $f$ explicitly, we can use a more direct argument based on the momentum balance, which is equivalent to taking the first moment of the BTE. Consider the average momentum of the electron ensemble, $\\langle \\mathbf{p} \\rangle$. The rate of change of the average momentum is determined by the average force exerted by the electric field and the rate of momentum loss due to collisions.\n$$\n\\frac{d\\langle \\mathbf{p} \\rangle}{dt} = \\langle \\mathbf{F} \\rangle + \\left( \\frac{d\\langle \\mathbf{p} \\rangle}{dt} \\right)_{\\text{coll}}\n$$\nThe average force is simply the force on a single electron, $\\langle \\mathbf{F} \\rangle = -q\\mathbf{E}$. The collision term represents a damping force that relaxes the average momentum back to its equilibrium value (which is zero) with a characteristic time $\\tau$. Thus, $\\left( \\frac{d\\langle \\mathbf{p} \\rangle}{dt} \\right)_{\\text{coll}} = -\\frac{\\langle \\mathbf{p} \\rangle}{\\tau}$.\n\nThe momentum balance equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\langle \\mathbf{p} \\rangle}{dt} = -q\\mathbf{E} - \\frac{\\langle \\mathbf{p} \\rangle}{\\tau}\n$$\nIn steady state, the average momentum is constant, so $\\frac{d\\langle \\mathbf{p} \\rangle}{dt} = 0$.

Solving for $\\langle \\mathbf{p} \\rangle_{ss}$ gives:\n$$\n\\langle \\mathbf{p} \\rangle_{ss} = -q\\tau\\mathbf{E}\n$$\nFor a parabolic band, the momentum is related to velocity by $\\mathbf{p} = m^{\\ast}\\mathbf{v}$, where $m^{\\ast}$ is the effective mass. The drift velocity $\\mathbf{v}_d$ is the average velocity of the ensemble, $\\mathbf{v}_d = \\langle \\mathbf{v} \\rangle = \\frac{\\langle \\mathbf{p} \\rangle_{ss}}{m^{\\ast}}$. Substituting the expression for $\\langle \\mathbf{p} \\rangle_{ss}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_d = -\\frac{q\\tau\\mathbf{E}}{m^{\\ast}}\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the electron drift is in the direction opposite to the electric field.

The problem specifies using the thermal velocity $v_{\\mathrm{th}}$ defined by $v_{\\mathrm{th}} = \\sqrt{2k_{B}T/m^{\\ast}}$.

The channel length is given as $L=15\\ \\mathrm{nm}$. We have calculated the mean free path to be $\\lambda \\approx 37.4\\ \\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nA critical comparison shows that $L  \\lambda$. The derivation of the steady-state drift velocity $v_d$ relies on the drift-diffusion model, which assumes that an electron undergoes many scattering events as it traverses the channel. These frequent collisions are what establish a steady-state condition where the acceleration due to the electric field is balanced by the friction-like drag from scattering. This picture is valid only when $L \\gg \\lambda$.\n\nIn the present case, since $L \\lesssim \\lambda$, a significant portion of electrons can travel from the source to the drain without undergoing any momentum-relaxing scattering events. This regime is known as ballistic or quasi-ballistic transport. In this regime, the fundamental assumption of the relaxation-time approximation—that collisions are frequent enough to maintain a near-equilibrium distribution—is violated. Electrons do not reach a constant steady-state drift velocity. Instead, they continuously accelerate under the influence of the electric field across the channel. Their final velocity upon reaching the drain would be limited by the potential drop across the channel, not by scattering. Therefore, the expression $v_{d} = q\\tau E/m^{\\ast}$ is not applicable to describe carrier transport in this $15\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ channel. A more advanced transport formalism, such as a full numerical solution of the BTE or a quantum transport model (e.g., NEGF), would be necessary to accurately capture the physics of ballistic transport and related hot carrier effects.",

We begin from the fundamental definition of current as charge flux, as understood within the virtual-source model of a transistor.\n\nAt the virtual source, which is the point of maximum potential energy barrier for carriers in the channel, we consider two populations of carriers (electrons, for an n-channel device). There is a forward-going population with sheet density $N^{+}$ moving towards the drain at the injection velocity $v_{inj}$, and a backward-going population with sheet density $N^{-}$ moving towards the source at velocity $-v_{inj}$ due to scattering events.\n\nLet $q$ be the magnitude of the elementary charge.
