This first practice simplifies the complex physics of deposition into a purely kinematic model, where film surfaces advance like wavefronts. By analyzing the competition between vertical and lateral growth rates, you can derive the precise location where a feature will pinch off, forming a seam and trapping a void. This exercise () provides a powerful first-principles foundation for visualizing and predicting how deposition rate anisotropy dictates the final film morphology.",

            "problem": "A vertical cylindrical via of initial radius $a$ and depth $H$ is to be filled by a film grown from the vapor phase. Assume an axisymmetric geometry with straight, vertical sidewalls and a flat bottom. The local film thickness grows at a constant rate normal to the surface: along the sidewalls at a uniform rate $R_s$ (reducing the via radius) and on the bottom at a uniform rate $R_b$ (raising the bottom interface). Neglect any top-surface overhang or re-entrant profile formation, gas-phase transport limitations, and any curvature-dependent effects; treat the deposition kinetics as purely kinematic with constant interface speeds. Define the dimensionless rate ratio $\\alpha \\equiv R_s/R_b$. The seam forms when the opposing sidewall fronts meet and the opening pinches off, trapping a void below the pinch-off plane. Under the physically relevant condition that a seam indeed forms within the via, namely $0  a/\\alpha  H$, use first-principles geometric kinematics of moving interfaces to derive an explicit analytic expression for the seam depth measured from the top surface downward at the instant of pinch-off, as a function of $\\alpha$. Express your final answer in symbolic form in terms of $H$, $a$, and $\\alpha$. No numerical evaluation is required and no units should be included in the final answer.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the depth of the seam formed during the filling of a cylindrical via. The analysis will be based on a kinematic model of film growth, where the film surface propagates locally normal to itself at a constant rate.\n\nFirst, we establish a coordinate system. Let the system be a cylindrical coordinate system `(r, θ, z)`. Due to the specified axisymmetry, the problem can be analyzed in a 2D cross-section in the `r-z` plane. Let the origin `(r=0, z=0)` be at the center of the via's initial bottom. The z-axis corresponds to the central axis of the via.\nThe initial geometry of the via is therefore described by:\n- The bottom surface: `z=0` for `0 \\le r \\le a$.\n- The sidewall: `r=a` for `0 \\le z \\le H`.\n- The top opening is at `z=H`.\n\nThe film growth is described by two constant rates:\n- `R_b`: the growth rate on the bottom surface, normal to the surface (in the `+z` direction).\n- `R_s`: the growth rate on the sidewall, normal to the surface (in the `-r` direction).\n\nThe problem statement neglects curvature effects, which allows us to model the evolving fronts as planar surfaces that remain orthogonal to the axes, a simplification often employed in ballistic or string models of deposition.\n\nAt any time `t  0`, the position of the growing film fronts can be described as follows:\n- The front originating from the bottom advances upward. Its position is a horizontal plane at `z_b(t) = R_b t`.\n- The front originating from the sidewall advances inward. Its position is a vertical cylindrical surface at `r_s(t) = a - R_s t`.\n\nPinch-off is the event where the growing films from the opposing sidewalls meet at the central axis, `r=0`. We can find the time at which pinch-off occurs, `t_p`, by setting `r_s(t_p) = 0`:\n$$a - R_s t_p = 0$$\nSolving for `t_p` gives the pinch-off time:\n$$t_p = \\frac{a}{R_s}$$\n\nWhen pinch-off occurs, a void is trapped below a certain height. The top of this void, which corresponds to the \"pinch-off plane\" mentioned in the problem, is the point on the central axis (`r=0`) that is simultaneously reached by the film growing from the bottom and the film growing from the sidewalls. Let the height of this point be `z_{tip}`, measured from the initial bottom of the via.\n\nThe time required for the film growing from the bottom to reach the height `z_{tip}` is:\n$$t_{bottom} = \\frac{z_{tip}}{R_b}$$\n\nThe time required for the film growing from the sidewall (initially at `r=a`) to reach the central axis (`r=0`) at any height `z` is:\n$$t_{side} = \\frac{a}{R_s}$$\nThis time is independent of the height `z`.\n\nThe tip of the void forms at the height `z_{tip}` where these two times are equal, `t_{bottom} = t_{side}`.\n$$\\frac{z_{tip}}{R_b} = \\frac{a}{R_s}$$\nNote that this equality also means that the void tip forms precisely at the pinch-off time `t_p`.\n\nWe can now solve for `z_{tip}`:\n$$z_{tip} = a \\frac{R_b}{R_s}$$\n\nThe problem defines the dimensionless rate ratio as `\\alpha \\equiv R_s/R_b`. Substituting this into the expression for `z_{tip}`:\n$$z_{tip} = a \\frac{1}{\\alpha} = \\frac{a}{\\alpha}$$\nThis height `z_{tip}` is measured from the bottom of the via (`z=0`). The provided condition `0  a/\\alpha  H` ensures that this `z_{tip}` is physically located within the initial via depth, `0  z_{tip}  H`, confirming that a void is indeed trapped.\n\nThe problem asks for the seam depth, `D`, measured from the top surface of the via (`z=H`) downward to the pinch-off plane (at `z=z_{tip}`). This depth is the difference between the total via depth and the height of the void tip:\n$$D = H - z_{tip}$$\nSubstituting the expression for `z_{tip}` yields the final expression for the seam depth:\n$$D = H - \\frac{a}{\\alpha}$$\nThis expression represents the depth from the top opening of the via to the highest point of the trapped void at the moment of pinch-off.",

            "problem": "A trench of width $W$ and depth $H$ is to be filled by a single-precursor Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) process. During deposition, voids can form within trenches and vias when the bottom surface receives significantly less flux than the top opening, which is quantified by the step coverage. Define the dimensionless step coverage $S$ as the ratio of the bottom film thickness to the top film thickness. A measurement yields $S=0.4$ for a trench with aspect ratio $H/W=10$, under steady-state flow and constant precursor partial pressure at the trench opening.\n\nAssume that precursor transport along the trench depth direction $z$ is governed by Fick’s law of diffusion and a first-order consumption (sink) due to surface reaction that can be homogenized into the trench volume. Let the effective volumetric rate constant be $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and the effective diffusivity be $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, both taken as constants along $z$. The one-dimensional steady-state precursor concentration $C(z)$ satisfies the species balance derived from conservation of mass and Fick’s first law, subject to a Dirichlet boundary condition at the opening $C(0)=C_{0}$ and a no-flux Neumann boundary condition at the bottom $\\frac{dC}{dz}\\big|_{z=H}=0$. The Thiele modulus is defined by $\\phi = H \\sqrt{k_{\\mathrm{eff}}/D_{\\mathrm{eff}}}$.\n\nStarting from these principles, derive a closed-form relationship between the step coverage $S$ and the Thiele modulus $\\phi$. Then, use the measured $S=0.4$ to back-calculate the effective $\\phi$ for this trench. Round your numerical value of $\\phi$ to four significant figures. Express your final answer as a dimensionless quantity.\n\nFinally, based on your derived relationship, explain qualitatively which process changes (e.g., modifications to $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, or gas-phase boundary conditions) would be required to achieve $S0.8$ for the same geometry, and provide the corresponding inequality constraint on $\\phi$ that would ensure $S \\geq 0.8$.

Since $S = \\mathrm{sech}(\\phi)$,\n$$\n\\cosh(\\phi) = \\frac{1}{S}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\n\\phi = \\arccosh\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{S}\\right) = \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{S} + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{S^{2}} - 1}\\right).\n$$\nSubstitute $S=0.4$:\n$$\n\\cosh(\\phi) = \\frac{1}{0.4} = 2.5,\n$$\n$$\n\\phi = \\arccosh(2.5) = \\ln\\!\\left(2.5 + \\sqrt{2.5^{2} - 1}\\right) = \\ln\\!\\left(2.5 + \\sqrt{6.25 - 1}\\right) = \\ln\\!\\left(2.5 + \\sqrt{5.25}\\right).\n$$\nEvaluating the square root and the logarithm symbolically first and then numerically for the final value,\n$$\n\\phi = \\ln\\!\\left(2.5 + \\sqrt{5.25}\\right).\n$$\nNumerically, $\\sqrt{5.25} \\approx 2.291287847$, so $2.5 + \\sqrt{5.25} \\approx 4.791287847$, and\n$$\n\\phi \\approx \\ln(4.791287847) \\approx 1.566799236.\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures, the effective Thiele modulus is\n$$\n\\phi \\approx 1.567.\n$$\n\nTo achieve $S0.8$ in the same geometry, the relationship $S = \\mathrm{sech}(\\phi)$ implies an upper bound on $\\phi$:\n$$\nS \\geq 0.8 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\mathrm{sech}(\\phi) \\geq 0.8 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\cosh(\\phi) \\leq \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\phi \\leq \\arccosh(1.25).\n$$\nCompute this bound in closed form:\n$$\n\\phi_{\\max} = \\arccosh(1.25) = \\ln\\!\\left(1.25 + \\sqrt{1.25^{2} - 1}\\right) = \\ln\\!\\left(1.25 + \\sqrt{0.5625}\\right) = \\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147.\n$$\nHence $S \\geq 0.8$ requires $\\phi \\leq \\ln(2)$. From $\\phi = H \\sqrt{k_{\\mathrm{eff}}/D_{\\mathrm{eff}}}$, this can be realized by:\n- Increasing $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}$: for example, operating at lower total pressure to increase the mean free path and transition toward Knudsen-diffusion-dominated transport in narrow trenches, optimizing precursor diffusivity by carrier gas selection, and modestly increasing temperature if it increases $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ without overly increasing $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n- Decreasing $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$: reducing the sticking coefficient via inhibitors or surfactants, lowering substrate temperature to decrease the surface reaction rate constant, or switching to self-limiting Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) cycles that effectively suppress deep-feature consumption during precursor dosing.\n- Maintaining a high and stable $C_{0}$ at the opening: employing pulsed or high-flow dosing to avoid depletion at the trench mouth, thereby ensuring the Dirichlet boundary $C(0)=C_{0}$ remains valid at a high value.\n\nFor a trench, the homogenized rate constant relates to geometry and surface kinetics via the surface-to-volume ratio. For a rectangular trench of width $W$ and depth $H$, the surface area per unit length is $2H + W$ and the volume per unit length is $WH$, so the surface-to-volume ratio is $\\frac{2}{W} + \\frac{1}{H}$. If the intrinsic first-order surface rate constant is $k_{s}$, a common homogenization gives $k_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx k_{s}\\left(\\frac{2}{W} + \\frac{1}{H}\\right)$. With $H/W = 10$, we have $\\frac{2}{W} + \\frac{1}{H} = \\frac{21}{H}$, so\n$$\n\\phi = H \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{D_{\\mathrm{eff}}}} \\approx H \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{s}}{D_{\\mathrm{eff}}} \\left(\\frac{21}{H}\\right)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{21 H k_{s}}{D_{\\mathrm{eff}}}}.\n$$\nThus achieving $\\phi \\leq \\ln(2)$ imposes\n$$\n\\frac{k_{s}}{D_{\\mathrm{eff}}} \\leq \\frac{(\\ln 2)^{2}}{21 H},\n$$\nquantifying how reductions in $k_{s}$ or increases in $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ (or both) can mitigate void formation by raising $S$ above $0.8$ for the given aspect ratio.",
