The microstructure of the resulting polymer chain, specifically the arrangement and length of monomer sequences, is critical to its final properties.\n\nA widely used kinetic model for this process is the **terminal model**, which assumes that the rate of addition of a monomer to a growing polymer chain depends only on the identity of the terminal monomer unit of that chain.

The propagation reaction where monomer $M_j$ adds to this chain is given by:\n$$ ~M_i^* + M_j \\xrightarrow{k_{ij}} ~M_j^* $$\nwhere $k_{ij}$ is the propagation rate constant.\n\nThe relative rates of monomer addition are often described by **reactivity ratios**, defined as $r_{ij} = k_{ii} / k_{ij}$.

The semiclassical model offers a powerful way to understand how electrons move through a crystal lattice under external fields, a core concept for modeling the behavior of many active MEMS/NEMS devices. In this problem , you will model the dynamics of an electron in a periodic potential, providing insight into the electronic behavior foundational to semiconductor-based microsystems.",

            "problem": "An electron is confined to a one-dimensional crystal lattice with lattice constant $a$. Its energy dispersion relation within the semiclassical model is given by $\\mathcal{E}(k) = C - \\Delta \\cos(ka)$, where $k$ is the crystal momentum, $C$ is a constant energy offset, and $\\Delta$ is a positive constant representing half the energy bandwidth. The charge of the electron is $-e$, where $e$ is the elementary charge.\n\nAt time $t=0$, the electron is located at the bottom of the energy band and is at rest (i.e., its group velocity is zero). For time $t \\ge 0$, a spatially uniform electric field $E(t)$ is applied along the lattice. The magnitude of this field increases linearly with time according to the relation $E(t) = \\alpha t$, where $\\alpha$ is a positive constant.\n\nUsing the semiclassical equations of motion, derive the time-dependent group velocity $v_g(t)$ of the electron for $t \\ge 0$. Your final answer should be expressed in terms of $t$, and the constants $\\Delta$, $a$, $e$, $\\alpha$, and the reduced Planck constant $\\hbar$.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the group velocity $v_g(t)$ of an electron in a 1D crystal under a time-ramped electric field. We will use the semiclassical model of electron dynamics in solids.\n\nThe two main equations of the semiclassical model are:\n1.  The equation of motion for the crystal momentum $\\hbar k$:\n    $$ \\hbar \\frac{dk}{dt} = F_{ext} $$\n2.  The expression for the electron's group velocity $v_g$:\n    $$ v_g(k) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\frac{d\\mathcal{E}(k)}{dk} $$\n\nFirst, we identify the external force $F_{ext}$. The force on a particle with charge $q=-e$ in an electric field $E(t)$ is $F_{ext} = qE(t) = -eE(t)$. Given $E(t) = \\alpha t$, the force is:\n$$ F_{ext} = -e \\alpha t $$\n\nSubstituting this into the equation of motion for $k$:\n$$ \\hbar \\frac{dk}{dt} = -e \\alpha t $$\n\nTo find $k(t)$, we need to integrate this differential equation with respect to time.\n$$ \\int_{k(0)}^{k(t)} dk' = -\\frac{e\\alpha}{\\hbar} \\int_0^t t' dt' $$\n\nWe need to determine the initial condition $k(0)$. The problem states that at $t=0$, the electron is at the bottom of the energy band. The energy is $\\mathcal{E}(k) = C - \\Delta \\cos(ka)$. To find the minimum energy, we need to maximize the term $\\cos(ka)$, since $\\Delta  0$. The maximum value of $\\cos(ka)$ is 1, which occurs when $ka = 2n\\pi$ for any integer $n$. We can choose the simplest case, $n=0$, which corresponds to $k=0$ at the center of the first Brillouin zone. So, $k(0)=0$.\nThe problem also states the initial group velocity is zero. Let's verify this is consistent with $k(0)=0$. We first compute the general expression for the group velocity:\n$$ v_g(k) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\frac{d}{dk} \\left( C - \\Delta \\cos(ka) \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar} ( - \\Delta (-a \\sin(ka)) ) = \\frac{\\Delta a}{\\hbar} \\sin(ka) $$\nAt $k=0$, the group velocity is $v_g(0) = \\frac{\\Delta a}{\\hbar} \\sin(0) = 0$. Thus, the initial condition $k(0)=0$ is correct.\n\nNow we can solve the integral for $k(t)$:\n$$ k(t) - k(0) = -\\frac{e\\alpha}{\\hbar} \\left[ \\frac{t'^2}{2} \\right]_0^t $$\n$$ k(t) - 0 = -\\frac{e\\alpha}{\\hbar} \\left( \\frac{t^2}{2} - 0 \\right) $$\n$$ k(t) = -\\frac{e\\alpha t^2}{2\\hbar} $$\n\nFinally, to find the group velocity as a function of time, $v_g(t)$, we substitute the expression for $k(t)$ into the general formula for $v_g(k)$:\n$$ v_g(t) = v_g(k(t)) = \\frac{\\Delta a}{\\hbar} \\sin(a \\cdot k(t)) $$\n$$ v_g(t) = \\frac{\\Delta a}{\\hbar} \\sin\\left(a \\left(-\\frac{e\\alpha t^2}{2\\hbar}\\right)\\right) $$\n\nUsing the property of the sine function that $\\sin(-x) = -\\sin(x)$, we arrive at the final expression for the group velocity:\n$$ v_g(t) = -\\frac{\\Delta a}{\\hbar} \\sin\\left(\\frac{e a \\alpha t^2}{2\\hbar}\\right) $$\nThis result shows that the velocity oscillates, but with a \"chirped\" frequency that increases with time, a direct consequence of the linearly ramping electric field.",
