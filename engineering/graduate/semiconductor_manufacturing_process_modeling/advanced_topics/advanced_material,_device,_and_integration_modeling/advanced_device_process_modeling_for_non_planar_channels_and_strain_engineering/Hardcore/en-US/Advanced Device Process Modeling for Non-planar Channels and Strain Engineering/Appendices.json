Epitaxial silicon-germanium (SiGe) source/drain regions are coherently grown adjacent to the channel. Assume the silicon fin behaves as a homogeneous, isotropic, linearly elastic solid under small strains, and that the epitaxial SiGe regions induce an eigenstrain due to lattice mismatch that is coherently transferred to the fin without plastic relaxation, dislocation formation, or thermal strain. The lattice mismatch is modeled by Vegard’s law with no bowing, such that the lattice parameter of SiGe with germanium mole fraction $x$ is $a_{\\mathrm{SiGe}}(x) = a_{\\mathrm{Si}} + x \\left(a_{\\mathrm{Ge}} - a_{\\mathrm{Si}}\\right)$, and the misfit strain relative to silicon is $\\varepsilon_{m} = \\left(a_{\\mathrm{SiGe}}(x) - a_{\\mathrm{Si}}\\right)/a_{\\mathrm{Si}}$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of linear elasticity and solid-state physics, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and objectively formulated.\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the strain tensor components in a silicon fin under two different sets of mechanical boundary conditions imposed by surrounding silicon-germanium (SiGe) regions. The analysis is based on the theory of linear isotropic elasticity.\n\nFirst, we calculate the fundamental misfit strain, $\\varepsilon_{m}$, which arises from the lattice mismatch between the SiGe alloy and the pure Si substrate. The lattice parameter of the $\\mathrm{Si}_{1-x}\\mathrm{Ge}_x$ alloy is given by Vegard's law as $a_{\\mathrm{SiGe}}(x) = a_{\\mathrm{Si}} + x \\left(a_{\\mathrm{Ge}} - a_{\\mathrm{Si}}\\right)$. The misfit strain is defined as $\\varepsilon_{m} = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{SiGe}}(x) - a_{\\mathrm{Si}}}{a_{\\mathrm{Si}}}$.\n\nSubstituting the given expression for $a_{\\mathrm{SiGe}}(x)$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{m} = \\frac{\\left[a_{\\mathrm{Si}} + x \\left(a_{\\mathrm{Ge}} - a_{\\mathrm{Si}}\\right)\\right] - a_{\\mathrm{Si}}}{a_{\\mathrm{Si}}} = x \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{Ge}} - a_{\\mathrm{Si}}}{a_{\\mathrm{Si}}} $$\nUsing the provided values $x = 0.25$, $a_{\\mathrm{Si}} = 5.431~\\mathrm{\\AA}$, and $a_{\\mathrm{Ge}} = 5.658~\\mathrm{\\AA}$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{m} = 0.25 \\times \\frac{5.658 - 5.431}{5.431} = 0.25 \\times \\frac{0.227}{5.431} \\approx 0.01044927 $$\nThis value of $\\varepsilon_m$ represents the tensile strain that the SiGe alloy would induce on a coherently attached silicon structure.\n\nThe constitutive equations for a linear, isotropic, elastic material (Hooke's Law) relate the strain components ($\\varepsilon_x, \\varepsilon_y, \\varepsilon_z$) to the stress components ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$):\n$$ \\varepsilon_x = \\frac{1}{E} \\left[ \\sigma_x - \\nu (\\sigma_y + \\sigma_z) \\right] $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_y = \\frac{1}{E} \\left[ \\sigma_y - \\nu (\\sigma_x + \\sigma_z) \\right] $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_z = \\frac{1}{E} \\left[ \\sigma_z - \\nu (\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y) \\right] $$\nHere, $E$ is Young's modulus and $\\nu$ is Poisson's ratio. These equations can be inverted to express stress in terms of strain:\n$$ \\sigma_i = \\frac{E}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)} \\left[ (1-\\nu)\\varepsilon_i + \\nu(\\varepsilon_j + \\varepsilon_k) \\right] $$\nwhere $\\{i, j, k\\}$ is a cyclic permutation of $\\{x, y, z\\}$.\n\nWe now analyze the two specified cases.\n\n**Case 1: Uniaxial Strain Case**\nIn this scenario, the SiGe source/drain regions impose an axial strain along the $x$-direction (channel axis), and the fin's other surfaces are traction-free.\nThe mechanical boundary conditions are interpreted as:\n1. Imposed axial strain: The total strain in the $x$-direction is fixed to the misfit strain, $\\varepsilon_{x}^{\\mathrm{uni}} = \\varepsilon_m$.\n2. Traction-free sidewalls (normal to $y$-axis): $\\sigma_{y} = 0$.\n3. Traction-free top surface (normal to $z$-axis): $\\sigma_{z} = 0$.\n\nThis corresponds to a state of uniaxial stress. The non-zero stress $\\sigma_x$ induces the strain $\\varepsilon_x$, and the fin is free to contract in the transverse directions. We can use the strain-stress relations with $\\sigma_y = \\sigma_z = 0$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{y} = \\frac{1}{E} \\left[ 0 - \\nu (\\sigma_x + 0) \\right] = -\\frac{\\nu \\sigma_x}{E} $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_{z} = \\frac{1}{E} \\left[ 0 - \\nu (\\sigma_x + 0) \\right] = -\\frac{\\nu \\sigma_x}{E} $$\nFor the axial direction:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{x} = \\frac{1}{E} \\left[ \\sigma_x - \\nu (0 + 0) \\right] = \\frac{\\sigma_x}{E} $$\nFrom these relations, we find the transverse strains due to the Poisson effect:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{y} = -\\nu \\varepsilon_{x} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\varepsilon_{z} = -\\nu \\varepsilon_{x} $$\nSubstituting the imposed strain condition $\\varepsilon_{x}^{\\mathrm{uni}} = \\varepsilon_m$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{x}^{\\mathrm{uni}} = \\varepsilon_m \\approx 0.01044927 $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_{y}^{\\mathrm{uni}} = \\varepsilon_{z}^{\\mathrm{uni}} = -\\nu \\varepsilon_m $$\nUsing $\\nu = 0.27$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{y}^{\\mathrm{uni}} = \\varepsilon_{z}^{\\mathrm{uni}} = -0.27 \\times 0.01044927 \\approx -0.00282130 $$\n\n**Case 2: Biaxial Strain Case**\nIn this scenario, coherent epitaxy on the fin sidewalls ($y$-direction) and top ($z$-direction) imposes in-plane strains, while the axial direction ($x$-direction) is traction-free.\nThe mechanical boundary conditions are:\n1. Traction-free axial direction: $\\sigma_{x} = 0$.\n2. Imposed sidewall strain (coherent epitaxy): $\\varepsilon_{y}^{\\mathrm{biax}} = \\varepsilon_m$.\n3. Imposed top surface strain (coherent epitaxy): $\\varepsilon_{z}^{\\mathrm{biax}} = \\varepsilon_m$.\n\nWe need to determine the resulting strain in the $x$-direction, $\\varepsilon_x$. For this, we use the stress-strain relation for $\\sigma_x$:\n$$ \\sigma_x = \\frac{E}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)} \\left[ (1-\\nu)\\varepsilon_x + \\nu(\\varepsilon_y + \\varepsilon_z) \\right] $$\nApplying the boundary condition $\\sigma_x = 0$, and noting that the pre-factor is non-zero, we must have:\n$$ (1-\\nu)\\varepsilon_x + \\nu(\\varepsilon_y + \\varepsilon_z) = 0 $$\nSubstituting the imposed strains $\\varepsilon_y = \\varepsilon_m$ and $\\varepsilon_z = \\varepsilon_m$:\n$$ (1-\\nu)\\varepsilon_x + \\nu(\\varepsilon_m + \\varepsilon_m) = 0 $$\n$$ (1-\\nu)\\varepsilon_x + 2\\nu\\varepsilon_m = 0 $$\nSolving for $\\varepsilon_x$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_x = - \\frac{2\\nu}{1-\\nu} \\varepsilon_m $$\nThe strain components for the biaxial case are therefore:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{x}^{\\mathrm{biax}} = - \\frac{2\\nu}{1-\\nu} \\varepsilon_m $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_{y}^{\\mathrm{biax}} = \\varepsilon_m \\approx 0.01044927 $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_{z}^{\\mathrm{biax}} = \\varepsilon_m \\approx 0.01044927 $$\nUsing $\\nu = 0.27$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{x}^{\\mathrm{biax}} = - \\frac{2 \\times 0.27}{1 - 0.27} \\varepsilon_m = - \\frac{0.54}{0.73} \\varepsilon_m \\approx -0.739726 \\times 0.01044927 \\approx -0.00772953 $$\n\nFinally, we compile the results and round each value to four significant figures for the final answer.\n- $\\varepsilon_{x}^{\\mathrm{uni}} \\approx 0.01044927 \\to 0.01045$\n- $\\varepsilon_{y}^{\\mathrm{uni}} \\approx -0.00282130 \\to -0.002821$\n- $\\varepsilon_{z}^{\\mathrm{uni}} \\approx -0.00282130 \\to -0.002821$\n- $\\varepsilon_{x}^{\\mathrm{biax}} \\approx -0.00772953 \\to -0.007730$\n- $\\varepsilon_{y}^{\\mathrm{biax}} \\approx 0.01044927 \\to 0.01045$\n- $\\varepsilon_{z}^{\\mathrm{biax}} \\approx 0.01044927 \\to 0.01045$\n\nThe final answer is presented as a single row matrix as requested.",

A solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of the Volumetric Heat Generation Density**\n\nWe begin from the first principle of work done on a charge carrier by an electric field. Consider a single electron with charge $-q$ moving with a drift velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ in an electric field $\\mathbf{E}$. The force exerted on the electron by the field is $\\mathbf{F} = -q\\mathbf{E}$. The infinitesimal work $dW$ done by the field on the electron as it moves a distance $d\\mathbf{l}$ is:\n$$dW = \\mathbf{F} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = -q\\mathbf{E} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l}$$\nThe rate at which work is done, which is the power $P_{\\mathrm{charge}}$ delivered to a single charge, is:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{charge}} = \\frac{dW}{dt} = -q\\mathbf{E} \\cdot \\frac{d\\mathbf{l}}{dt} = -q\\mathbf{E} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}$$\nIn steady-state drift, this power is transferred from the electron to the crystal lattice via scattering events, manifesting as heat. The electron current density $\\mathbf{J}$ is defined by the flow of charge, $\\mathbf{J} = n(-q)\\mathbf{v}$, where $n$ is the electron volume concentration. From this, we can write the drift velocity as $\\mathbf{v} = -\\frac{\\mathbf{J}}{nq}$.\n\nThe volumetric heat generation density, $Q$, is the total power dissipated per unit volume. This is the product of the power per charge carrier, $P_{\\mathrm{charge}}$, and the number of charge carriers per unit volume, $n$.\n$$Q = n \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{charge}} = n(-q\\mathbf{E} \\cdot \\mathbf{v})$$\nSubstituting the expression for the drift velocity $\\mathbf{v}$:\n$$Q = n(-q\\mathbf{E} \\cdot (-\\frac{\\mathbf{J}}{nq})) = \\mathbf{E} \\cdot \\mathbf{J}$$\nThis completes the derivation. The volumetric heat generation density is the dot product of the electric field and the current density.\n\n**Task 2: Derivation of the Maximum Temperature Rise**\n\nThe problem is modeled as steady-state, one-dimensional heat conduction along the $x$-axis from the source ($x=0$) to the drain ($x=L$). The governing differential equation is the heat equation with a source term:\n$$k \\frac{d^2T}{dx^2} + Q = 0$$\nwhere $T(x)$ is the temperature profile and $k$ is the thermal conductivity. The heat generation density $Q$ is uniform throughout the channel based on the problem's assumptions. As derived in Task 1, $Q = \\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\mathbf{E}$. For the one-dimensional case, this becomes $Q = JE$.\n\nThe electric field $E$ is uniform: $E = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{ds}}}{L}$.\nThe current density $J$ is given by the drift-diffusion relation, which simplifies to Ohm's law in this context: $J = qn\\mu(\\varepsilon)E$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $Q$:\n$$Q = (qn\\mu(\\varepsilon)E)E = qn\\mu(\\varepsilon)E^2 = qn\\mu(\\varepsilon)\\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{ds}}}{L}\\right)^2$$\nThe heat equation is therefore:\n$$\\frac{d^2T}{dx^2} = -\\frac{Q}{k}$$\nIntegrating this equation twice with respect to $x$ yields the general solution for the temperature profile:\n$$\\frac{dT}{dx} = -\\frac{Q}{k}x + C_1$$\n$$T(x) = -\\frac{Q}{2k}x^2 + C_1x + C_2$$\nThe constants of integration, $C_1$ and $C_2$, are determined by the boundary conditions: $T(0) = T_0$ and $T(L) = T_0$.\nApplying the first boundary condition at $x=0$:\n$$T(0) = -\\frac{Q}{2k}(0)^2 + C_1(0) + C_2 = T_0 \\implies C_2 = T_0$$\nApplying the second boundary condition at $x=L$:\n$$T(L) = -\\frac{Q}{2k}L^2 + C_1L + T_0 = T_0$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$-\\frac{Q}{2k}L^2 + C_1L = 0 \\implies C_1 = \\frac{QL}{2k}$$\nSubstituting $C_1$ and $C_2$ back into the temperature profile equation:\n$$T(x) = -\\frac{Q}{2k}x^2 + \\frac{QL}{2k}x + T_0$$\nThe temperature rise above the contact temperature $T_0$ is $\\Delta T(x) = T(x) - T_0$.\n$$\\Delta T(x) = \\frac{Q}{2k}(Lx - x^2)$$\nTo find the maximum temperature rise, $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{max}}$, we find the position $x$ where the temperature gradient is zero, $\\frac{d(\\Delta T)}{dx}=0$.\n$$\\frac{d(\\Delta T)}{dx} = \\frac{Q}{2k}(L - 2x) = 0 \\implies x = \\frac{L}{2}$$\nThe maximum temperature occurs at the center of the fin. Substituting $x = L/2$ into the expression for $\\Delta T(x)$:\n$$\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\Delta T\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) = \\frac{Q}{2k}\\left(L\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right)^2\\right) = \\frac{Q}{2k}\\left(\\frac{L^2}{2} - \\frac{L^2}{4}\\right) = \\frac{Q}{2k}\\left(\\frac{L^2}{4}\\right)$$\n$$\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\frac{QL^2}{8k}$$\nFinally, we substitute the expression for $Q$:\n$$\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\frac{\\left(qn\\mu(\\varepsilon)\\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{ds}}}{L}\\right)^2\\right)L^2}{8k} = \\frac{qn\\mu(\\varepsilon)V_{\\mathrm{ds}}^2}{8k}$$\nSubstituting $\\mu(\\varepsilon) = \\mu_{0}(1 + \\alpha \\varepsilon)$:\n$$\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\frac{qn\\mu_0(1 + \\alpha\\varepsilon)V_{\\mathrm{ds}}^2}{8k}$$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the maximum temperature rise.\n\n**Task 3: Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe now calculate the numerical value for $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{max}}$ using the provided parameters, all of which are in SI units.\n-   $q = 1.602\\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}$\n-   $n = 4.0\\times 10^{24}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-3}}$\n-   $\\mu_0 = 0.05\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}\\,V^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}$\n-   $\\alpha = 20$\n-   $\\varepsilon = 0.01$\n-   $V_{\\mathrm{ds}} = 0.70\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n-   $k = 120\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the strained mobility $\\mu(\\varepsilon)$:\n$$\\mu(\\varepsilon) = \\mu_0(1 + \\alpha\\varepsilon) = (0.05)(1 + (20)(0.01)) = (0.05)(1 + 0.2) = (0.05)(1.2) = 0.06\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}\\,V^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}$$\nNow, we substitute all values into the derived expression for $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{max}}$:\n$$\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\frac{qn\\mu(\\varepsilon)V_{\\mathrm{ds}}^2}{8k}$$\n$$\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\frac{(1.602\\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}) (4.0\\times 10^{24}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-3}}) (0.06\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}\\,V^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}) (0.70\\ \\mathrm{V})^2}{8 (120\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}})}$$\n$$\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\frac{(1.602\\times 10^{-19}) (4.0\\times 10^{24}) (0.06) (0.49)}{960}\\ \\mathrm{K}$$\n$$\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\frac{18839.52}{960}\\ \\mathrm{K}$$\n$$\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{max}} \\approx 19.6245\\ \\mathrm{K}$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get $19.6\\ \\mathrm{K}$.",

After convergence, compute both the electrothermally coupled mobility and the isothermal mobility (evaluated at $T_{\\mathrm{amb}}$ with the same strain), and report the ratio $\\mu_{\\mathrm{coupled}} / \\mu_{\\mathrm{iso}}$ as a dimensionless decimal number for each test case.\n\nPhysical constants and units:\n- Use $q = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}$ C.\n- Express temperature in kelvin ($\\mathrm{K}$), electric field in V/m, thermal conductivity in $\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$, length and radius in m, carrier density in $\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$, and mobility in $\\mathrm{m^2\\,V^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}$.\n- Strain $\\epsilon$ is dimensionless and given as a decimal (for example, $0.01$ for $1\\%$ tensile strain and $-0.005$ for $0.5\\%$ compressive strain).\n- The final output must be dimensionless ratios; do not include any unit symbols in the output.\n\nNumerical method requirements:\n- Treat the axial temperature distribution under uniform heating and fixed end temperatures consistently with the above physical relations. Use the spatial average temperature of the channel as the temperature argument in the mobility function for the coupled calculation.\n- Solve the electrothermal coupling by fixed-point iteration on the average temperature $T_{\\mathrm{avg}}$, starting from $T_{\\mathrm{amb}}$, until a specified tolerance is met.\n- Ensure scientific realism by using physically plausible parameter values, and ensure numerical stability by using a reasonable tolerance and iteration cap.\n\nTest suite:\nProvide the ratio $\\mu_{\\mathrm{coupled}} / \\mu_{\\mathrm{iso}}$ for each of the following five parameter sets.

            "solution": "The posed problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and free of contradictions, thus it is deemed valid. We are tasked with quantifying the effect of self-heating on carrier mobility in a cylindrical nanowire channel. This requires solving a coupled electrothermal problem. We will first derive the necessary equations and then outline the numerical procedure.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the interdependence of carrier mobility, $\\mu$, and channel temperature, $T$. The mobility is a function of temperature, $\\mu = \\mu(T)$, while the Joule heating, which elevates the temperature, is a function of mobility, $q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime} \\propto \\mu$. This feedback loop necessitates a self-consistent solution.\n\nFirst, we define the isothermal mobility, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{iso}}$, which serves as our baseline. This is the mobility calculated under the assumption that the channel remains at the ambient temperature, $T_{\\mathrm{amb}}$, ignoring any self-heating. Using the provided mobility model:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{iso}} = \\mu(T_{\\mathrm{amb}}, \\epsilon) = \\mu_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\left(\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{T_{\\mathrm{amb}}}\\right)^{\\beta} (1 + \\alpha \\epsilon) $$\nHere, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ is the reference mobility at temperature $T_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, $\\beta$ is the phonon-scattering exponent, $\\alpha$ is the strain-enhancement factor, and $\\epsilon$ is the strain.\n\nNext, we address the electrothermal coupling. The problem states that the coupling should be modeled by using the spatially-averaged channel temperature, $T_{\\mathrm{avg}}$, as the representative temperature for the entire channel. The mobility that accounts for self-heating, which we will call the coupled mobility $\\mu_{\\mathrm{coupled}}$, is therefore given by:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{coupled}} = \\mu(T_{\\mathrm{avg}}, \\epsilon) = \\mu_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\left(\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{T_{\\mathrm{avg}}}\\right)^{\\beta} (1 + \\alpha \\epsilon) $$\nwhere $T_{\\mathrm{avg}}$ is the yet-to-be-determined self-consistent average temperature.\n\nTo find $T_{\\mathrm{avg}}$, we must solve the steady-state, one-dimensional heat conduction equation for the channel, which is given as:\n$$ k \\frac{d^2 T}{d x^2} + q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime} = 0 $$\nThe boundary conditions are fixed temperatures at the source and drain ends of the channel: $T(0) = T(L) = T_{\\mathrm{amb}}$. The volumetric heat source, $q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}$, is due to Joule heating and is assumed to be uniform along the channel. It is defined by:\n$$ q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime} = J E = (q n \\mu E) E = q n \\mu E^2 $$\nHere, $q$ is the elementary charge, $n$ is the uniform carrier density, and $E$ is the uniform axial electric field. Since $\\mu$ is evaluated at $T_{\\mathrm{avg}}$, the heat source $q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}$ is also a function of $T_{\\mathrm{avg}}$.\n\nWe can solve the heat equation by integrating twice with respect to the channel position $x$:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 T}{d x^2} = -\\frac{q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}}{k} $$\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dx} = -\\frac{q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}}{k} x + C_1 $$\n$$ T(x) = -\\frac{q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}}{2k} x^2 + C_1 x + C_2 $$\nApplying the boundary conditions to find the integration constants $C_1$ and $C_2$:\n$T(0) = T_{\\mathrm{amb}} \\Rightarrow C_2 = T_{\\mathrm{amb}}$.\n$T(L) = T_{\\mathrm{amb}} \\Rightarrow T_{\\mathrm{amb}} = -\\frac{q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}}{2k} L^2 + C_1 L + T_{\\mathrm{amb}} \\Rightarrow C_1 L = \\frac{q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime} L^2}{2k} \\Rightarrow C_1 = \\frac{q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime} L}{2k}$.\nThe temperature profile along the channel is thus a parabola:\n$$ T(x) = T_{\\mathrm{amb}} + \\frac{q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}}{2k} (Lx - x^2) $$\nThe peak temperature occurs at the channel center, $x=L/2$.\n\nThe next step is to find the spatial average of this temperature profile, $T_{\\mathrm{avg}}$:\n$$ T_{\\mathrm{avg}} = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_0^L T(x) dx = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_0^L \\left[T_{\\mathrm{amb}} + \\frac{q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}}{2k} (Lx - x^2)\\right] dx $$\n$$ T_{\\mathrm{avg}} = T_{\\mathrm{amb}} + \\frac{q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}}{2kL} \\left[L\\frac{x^2}{2} - \\frac{x^3}{3}\\right]_0^L = T_{\\mathrm{amb}} + \\frac{q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}}{2kL} \\left(\\frac{L^3}{2} - \\frac{L^3}{3}\\right) = T_{\\mathrm{amb}} + \\frac{q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime} L^2}{12k} $$\nThis equation links $T_{\\mathrm{avg}}$ to the heat source $q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}$, which itself depends on the mobility $\\mu(T_{\\mathrm{avg}})$. Substituting the expression for $q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}$ gives the self-consistency equation for $T_{\\mathrm{avg}}$:\n$$ T_{\\mathrm{avg}} = T_{\\mathrm{amb}} + \\frac{(q n \\mu(T_{\\mathrm{avg}}) E^2) L^2}{12k} $$\n$$ T_{\\mathrm{avg}} = T_{\\mathrm{amb}} + \\frac{q n E^2 L^2}{12k} \\left[ \\mu_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\left(\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{T_{\\mathrm{avg}}}\\right)^{\\beta} (1 + \\alpha \\epsilon) \\right] $$\nThis is a non-linear equation for $T_{\\mathrm{avg}}$ that can be solved using fixed-point iteration. We define an iterative map $T_{i+1} = G(T_i)$, where $T_i$ is the guess for $T_{\\mathrm{avg}}$ at iteration $i$:\n$$ T_{i+1} = T_{\\mathrm{amb}} + \\frac{q n E^2 L^2 \\mu_{\\mathrm{ref}} T_{\\mathrm{ref}}^{\\beta} (1 + \\alpha \\epsilon)}{12k} T_i^{-\\beta} $$\nThe iteration is started with an initial guess $T_0 = T_{\\mathrm{amb}}$ and continued until the change $|T_{i+1} - T_i|$ is smaller than a specified tolerance. Let the converged temperature be $T_{\\mathrm{converged}}$.\n\nThe final task is to compute the ratio $\\mu_{\\mathrm{coupled}} / \\mu_{\\mathrm{iso}}$.\n$$ \\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{coupled}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrmiso}} = \\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\left(\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{T_{\\mathrm{converged}}}\\right)^{\\beta} (1 + \\alpha \\epsilon)}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\left(\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{T_{\\mathrm{amb}}}\\right)^{\\beta} (1 + \\alpha \\epsilon)} $$\nThe terms $\\mu_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, $T_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, and $(1 + \\alpha \\epsilon)$ cancel, yielding a beautifully simple result:\n$$ \\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{coupled}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{iso}}} = \\left(\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{amb}}}{T_{\\mathrm{converged}}}\\right)^{\\beta} $$\nThis ratio elegantly captures the mobility degradation solely in terms of the temperature rise and the material's phonon scattering exponent. If there is no heating ($E=0$), then $T_{\\mathrm{converged}} = T_{\\mathrm{amb}}$ and the ratio is $1$, as expected.\n\nThe algorithm for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Identify all input parameters: $L$, $n$, $k$, $T_{\\mathrm{amb}}$, $E$, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, $T_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, $\\beta$, $\\alpha$, $\\epsilon$. The elementary charge is $q = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}$. The nanowire radius $R$ is extraneous to this 1D model.\n2.  If $E=0$, the converged temperature is $T_{\\mathrm{converged}} = T_{\\mathrm{amb}}$. The ratio is $1.0$.\n3.  If $E \\neq 0$, perform a fixed-point iteration:\n    a. Pre-compute the constant part of the iterative map for efficiency: $C = \\frac{q n E^2 L^2 \\mu_{\\mathrm{ref}} T_{\\mathrm{ref}}^{\\beta} (1 + \\alpha \\epsilon)}{12k}$.\n    b. Initialize $T_{\\mathrm{current}} = T_{\\mathrm{amb}}$.\n    c. Loop: calculate $T_{\\mathrm{next}} = T_{\\mathrm{amb}} + C \\cdot T_{\\mathrm{current}}^{-\\beta}$.\n    d. Check for convergence: if $|T_{\\mathrm{next}} - T_{\\mathrm{current}}|  \\text{tolerance}$ (e.g., $10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{K}$), exit the loop.\n    e. Update: $T_{\\mathrm{current}} = T_{\\mathrm{next}}$. A reasonable iteration limit (e.g., $100$) should be used to prevent infinite loops.\n    f. The result of the iteration is $T_{\\mathrm{converged}} = T_{\\mathrm{next}}$.\n4.  Calculate the final ratio: $(\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{amb}}}{T_{\\mathrm{converged}}})^{\\beta}$.\n5.
