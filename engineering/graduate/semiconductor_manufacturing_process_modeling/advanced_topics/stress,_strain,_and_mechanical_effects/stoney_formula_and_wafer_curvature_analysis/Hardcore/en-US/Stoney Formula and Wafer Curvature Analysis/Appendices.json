            "problem": "A silicon wafer of thickness $t_{s}$ carries a thin, uniformly stressed film of thickness $t_{f}$. The substrate is isotropic with Young’s modulus $E_{s}$ and Poisson’s ratio $\\nu_{s}$. The wafer curvature is measured using a Multi-beam Optical Stress Sensor (MOSS), in which two parallel laser spots reflected from the wafer surface are recorded on a detector placed a distance $L$ away. The initial wafer is flat, and after film deposition the spot-to-spot separation on the detector changes by $\\Delta$ relative to the initial separation. The corresponding beam separation on the wafer is $s$. Assume small slopes, near-normal incidence, and that the film is much thinner than the substrate ($t_{f} \\ll t_{s}$), so that the film contributes only in-plane force while the substrate supplies the bending stiffness. Also assume equi-biaxial curvature and stress.\n\nStarting from classical thin plate (Kirchhoff–Love) theory and specular reflection geometry, first derive an expression that relates the wafer curvature $\\kappa$ to the measured quantities $\\Delta$, $L$, and $s$. Then, using force–moment balance and the plate moment–curvature relation for an isotropic substrate under equi-biaxial bending, derive an expression for the film stress $\\sigma_{f}$ in terms of $\\kappa$, $E_{s}$, $\\nu_{s}$, $t_{s}$, and $t_{f}$.

The MOSS technique is a widely used method for stress measurement.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a standard, well-posed problem in applied mechanics and materials science. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of Curvature $\\kappa$\n\nLet the wafer surface profile be described by the function $w(x)$, where $x$ is the radial coordinate from the center. Due to the assumption of equi-biaxial curvature, the wafer deforms into a spherical cap. For a one-dimensional cross-section passing through the center, this profile can be approximated by a parabola for small deflections:\n$$w(x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa x^2$$\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the curvature, related to the radius of curvature $R$ by $\\kappa = \\frac{1}{R}$.\n\nThe local slope of the surface at position $x$ is given by the first derivative:\n$$\\theta(x) = \\frac{dw}{dx} = \\kappa x$$\nFor an incident laser beam normal to the undeflected wafer plane (i.e., parallel to the $w$-axis), the angle of incidence with the local surface normal is $\\theta(x)$. According to the law of specular reflection, the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence. The reflected beam is therefore deviated by an angle of $2\\theta(x)$ from the incident direction.\n\nThe MOSS system uses two parallel beams incident on the wafer at positions $x_1$ and $x_2$. We can set a coordinate system such that $x_1 = -s/2$ and $x_2 = +s/2$, where $s$ is the beam separation on the wafer. The deviation angles of the two reflected beams are:\n$$\\alpha_1 = 2\\theta(x_1) = 2\\kappa x_1 = - \\kappa s$$\n$$\\alpha_2 = 2\\theta(x_2) = 2\\kappa x_2 = + \\kappa s$$\nThese beams travel a distance $L$ to a detector. Using the small angle approximation ($\\tan \\alpha \\approx \\alpha$), the positions of the spots on the detector, $x'_1$ and $x'_2$, are:\n$$x'_1 \\approx x_1 + L \\alpha_1 = x_1 - L\\kappa s$$\n$$x'_2 \\approx x_2 + L \\alpha_2 = x_2 + L\\kappa s$$\nThe initial separation of the spots (from a flat wafer, $\\kappa=0$) is $s_{initial} = x_2 - x_1 = s$. The final separation on the detector is:\n$$s' = x'_2 - x'_1 = (x_2 + L\\kappa s) - (x_1 - L\\kappa s) = (x_2 - x_1) + 2L\\kappa s = s + 2L\\kappa s$$\nThe change in spot separation, $\\Delta$, is the difference between the final and initial separations:\n$$\\Delta = s' - s_{initial} = (s + 2L\\kappa s) - s = 2L\\kappa s$$\nSolving for the curvature $\\kappa$ gives the desired relation:\n$$\\kappa = \\frac{\\Delta}{2Ls}$$\n\n### Part 2: Derivation of Film Stress $\\sigma_f$ (Stoney's Formula)\n\nWe analyze the forces and moments in the film-substrate composite structure. The film is under a uniform, equi-biaxial stress $\\sigma_f$. This stress generates a force per unit length, $F$, acting at the film-substrate interface, given by:\n$$F = \\sigma_f t_f$$\nSince the film thickness is much smaller than the substrate thickness ($t_f \\ll t_s$), we can assume the neutral axis of bending for the composite structure lies at the mid-plane of the substrate. The force $F$ acts at a distance of approximately $t_s/2$ from this neutral axis. This creates a bending moment per unit length, $M$, in the substrate:\n$$M = F \\cdot \\frac{t_s}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_f t_f t_s$$\nThis internal moment must be balanced by the restorative moment from the substrate's elastic bending. According to Kirchhoff–Love plate theory, for an isotropic plate under equi-biaxial curvature $\\kappa$, the relationship between the applied moment per unit length $M$ and the curvature $\\kappa$ is:\n$$M = D(\\kappa_x + \\nu_s \\kappa_y) = D(\\kappa + \\nu_s \\kappa) = D\\kappa(1+\\nu_s)$$\nwhere $D$ is the flexural rigidity of the substrate, given by:\n$$D = \\frac{E_s t_s^3}{12(1-\\nu_s^2)}$$\nSubstituting $D$ into the moment-curvature equation and using the identity $(1-\\nu_s^2) = (1-\\nu_s)(1+\\nu_s)$:\n$$M = \\frac{E_s t_s^3}{12(1-\\nu_s^2)}\\kappa(1+\\nu_s) = \\frac{E_s t_s^3}{12(1-\\nu_s)}\\kappa$$\nNow, we equate the two expressions for the moment $M$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_f t_f t_s = \\frac{E_s t_s^3}{12(1-\\nu_s)}\\kappa$$\nFinally, we solve for the film stress $\\sigma_f$:\n$$\\sigma_f = \\frac{2}{t_f t_s} \\left( \\frac{E_s t_s^3}{12(1-\\nu_s)}\\kappa \\right) = \\frac{E_s t_s^2}{6(1-\\nu_s)t_f}\\kappa$$\nThis is the celebrated Stoney's formula. The term $\\frac{E_s}{1-\\nu_s}$ is the biaxial modulus of the substrate.\n\n### Part 3: Numerical Evaluation of $\\sigma_f$\n\nFirst, we combine the expressions for $\\kappa$ and $\\sigma_f$:\n$$\\sigma_f = \\frac{E_s t_s^2}{6(1-\\nu_s)t_f} \\left( \\frac{\\Delta}{2Ls} \\right) = \\frac{E_s t_s^2 \\Delta}{12(1-\\nu_s)t_f L s}$$\nNext, we convert all given values to base SI units (meters, Pascals):\n- $\\Delta = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 0.8 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $L = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $s = 20\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 20 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $t_{s} = 725\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m} = 725 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $t_{f} = 300\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 300 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $E_{s} = 130\\,\\mathrm{GPa} = 130 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n- $\\nu_{s} = 0.28$ (dimensionless)\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the combined formula:\n$$\\sigma_f = \\frac{(130 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Pa}) (725 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2 (0.8 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m})}{12(1 - 0.28) (300 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}) (0.5\\,\\mathrm{m}) (20 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m})}$$\nLet's evaluate the numerator and denominator separately.\nNumerator:\n$$N = (130 \\times 10^9) \\times (5.25625 \\times 10^{-7}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-4}) = 546.65 \\times 10^{-1} = 54.665$$\nDenominator:\n$$D = 12 \\times 0.72 \\times (3 \\times 10^{-7}) \\times 0.5 \\times (2 \\times 10^{-2}) = (12 \\times 0.72 \\times 3 \\times 0.5 \\times 2) \\times 10^{-9} = 25.92 \\times 10^{-9}$$\nNow calculate the stress in Pascals:\n$$\\sigma_f = \\frac{N}{D} = \\frac{54.665}{25.92 \\times 10^{-9}} \\approx 2.1090046 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$$\nThe problem asks for the result in GigaPascals (GPa), where $1\\,\\mathrm{GPa} = 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.\n$$\\sigma_f \\approx 2.1090046\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\\sigma_f = 2.109\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$$\nThe positive sign indicates that the film is under tensile stress.",

There are no contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-consistent. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Classical Thin-Film Limit (Stoney's Formula)\n\nThe classical Stoney formula is derived under the assumptions that the film is much thinner than the substrate ($t_f \\ll t_s$) and the bending stiffness of the film is negligible compared to that of the substrate.\n\nLet us establish a coordinate system with the origin $z=0$ at the mid-plane of the substrate. The substrate lies in the range $-t_s/2 \\le z \\le t_s/2$, and the film lies in the range $t_s/2 \\le z \\le t_s/2 + t_f$.\n\nThe uniform intrinsic stress $\\sigma_f$ in the film creates a bending moment that causes the bilayer to curve. This moment is balanced by the restoring moment from the bending stresses in the substrate and film. The total moment on any cross-section must be zero for static equilibrium.\n\nThe bending moment $M_{ext}$ generated by the film's intrinsic stress, calculated with respect to the substrate's mid-plane ($z=0$), is the film force multiplied by its lever arm. The force per unit width is $F_f = \\sigma_f t_f$. The centroid of the film is at $z_c = t_s/2 + t_f/2$.\n$$ M_{ext} = F_f \\cdot z_c = (\\sigma_f t_f) \\left( \\frac{t_s}{2} + \\frac{t_f}{2} \\right) $$\nUnder the assumption $t_f \\ll t_s$, the lever arm is approximately $t_s/2$.\n$$ M_{ext} \\approx \\sigma_f t_f \\frac{t_s}{2} $$\nThe internal restoring moment $M_{int}$ is generated by the bending stresses in the substrate and film. The problem states the bending strain is $\\varepsilon_b(z) = zk$, which implies the neutral axis is at $z=0$. The bending stress is $\\sigma_b(z) = M(z) \\varepsilon_b(z) = M(z) k z$.\nThe restoring moment is the integral of the moment of the stress distribution about the neutral axis:\n$$ M_{int} = \\int_{-t_s/2}^{t_s/2+t_f} \\sigma_b(z) z dz = k \\left( \\int_{-t_s/2}^{t_s/2} M_s z^2 dz + \\int_{t_s/2}^{t_s/2+t_f} M_f z^2 dz \\right) $$\nThe first integral is the flexural rigidity of the substrate per unit width, $D_s = M_s \\frac{t_s^3}{12}$. The second integral represents the flexural rigidity of the film about the substrate's mid-plane. The assumption that the film's bending stiffness is negligible means we can ignore the second term.\n$$ M_{int} \\approx k \\left( M_s \\frac{t_s^3}{12} \\right) $$\nEquating the external and internal moments, $M_{int} = M_{ext}$:\n$$ k M_s \\frac{t_s^3}{12} = \\sigma_f t_f \\frac{t_s}{2} $$\nSolving for the curvature $k$, we obtain the Stoney formula:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{Stoney}} = \\frac{6 \\sigma_f t_f}{M_s t_s^2} $$\n\n### Derivation of the Finite-Thickness Corrected Curvature\n\nFor the corrected formula, we treat the bilayer as a composite beam without the previous simplifying assumptions. It is more convenient to place the coordinate origin $z=0$ at the interface between the film and substrate. The substrate occupies $-t_s \\le z \\le 0$ and the film occupies $0 \\le z \\le t_f$.\n\n1.  **Position of the Neutral Axis ($z_n$)**\n    The neutral axis is the plane where the first moment of the modulus-weighted area is zero.\n    $$ \\int_{-t_s}^{t_f} M(z)(z-z_n) dz = 0 $$\n    $$ \\int_{-t_s}^{0} M_s(z-z_n) dz + \\int_{0}^{t_f} M_f(z-z_n) dz = 0 $$\n    $$ M_s \\left[ \\frac{z^2}{2} - z_n z \\right]_{-t_s}^0 + M_f \\left[ \\frac{z^2}{2} - z_n z \\right]_0^{t_f} = M_s \\left( -\\frac{t_s^2}{2} - z_n t_s \\right) + M_f \\left( \\frac{t_f^2}{2} - z_n t_f \\right) = 0 $$\n    Solving for $z_n$:\n    $$ z_n(M_s t_s + M_f t_f) = \\frac{1}{2} (M_f t_f^2 - M_s t_s^2) \\implies z_n = \\frac{M_f t_f^2 - M_s t_s^2}{2(M_s t_s + M_f t_f)} $$\n\n2.  **Driving Bending Moment ($M_{int}$)**\n    The intrinsic stress $\\sigma_f$ in the film generates a force per unit width $F_f = \\sigma_f t_f$. This force acts at the centroid of the film, located at $z = t_f/2$. The moment is calculated with respect to the neutral axis $z_n$.\n    $$ M_{int} = F_f \\times (\\text{lever arm}) = (\\sigma_f t_f) \\left( \\frac{t_f}{2} - z_n \\right) $$\n\n3.  **Composite Flexural Rigidity ($D_{comp}$)**\n    The flexural rigidity of the composite beam per unit width is the second moment of the modulus-weighted area about the neutral axis.\n    $$ D_{comp} = \\int_{-t_s}^{t_f} M(z)(z-z_n)^2 dz = \\int_{-t_s}^{0} M_s(z-z_n)^2 dz + \\int_{0}^{t_f} M_f(z-z_n)^2 dz $$\n    Using the parallel axis theorem for each layer:\n    $$ D_{comp} = \\left( M_s \\frac{t_s^3}{12} + M_s t_s \\left(z_n - (-\\frac{t_s}{2})\\right)^2 \\right) + \\left( M_f \\frac{t_f^3}{12} + M_f t_f \\left(\\frac{t_f}{2} - z_n\\right)^2 \\right) $$\n\n4.  **Corrected Curvature ($k_{\\mathrm{corrected}}$)**\n    The curvature is the ratio of the driving moment to the composite flexural rigidity.\n    $$ k_{\\mathrm{corrected}} = \\frac{M_{int}}{D_{comp}} = \\frac{\\sigma_f t_f (t_f/2 - z_n)}{\\left( M_s \\frac{t_s^3}{12} + M_s t_s (z_n + \\frac{t_s}{2})^2 \\right) + \\left( M_f \\frac{t_f^3}{12} + M_f t_f (\\frac{t_f}{2} - z_n)^2 \\right)} $$\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\nThe given parameters are converted to base SI units:\n$t_s = 300 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$t_f = 10 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$M_s = 160 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n$M_f = 200 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n$\\sigma_f = 300 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n\n**Stoney Curvature:**\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{Stoney}} = \\frac{6 \\times (300 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Pa}) \\times (10 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m})}{(160 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Pa}) \\times (300 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2} = \\frac{18000}{160 \\times 10^9 \\times 90000 \\times 10^{-12}} = \\frac{18000}{14400} = 1.25\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1} $$\nRounded to four significant figures, $k_{\\mathrm{Stoney}} = 1.250\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$.\n\n**Corrected Curvature:**\nFirst, we calculate the intermediate terms.\n$M_s t_s = (160 \\times 10^9) \\times (300 \\times 10^{-6}) = 4.8 \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$\n$M_f t_f = (200 \\times 10^9) \\times (10 \\times 10^{-6}) = 2.0 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$\n$M_s t_s^2 = (4.8 \\times 10^7) \\times (300 \\times 10^{-6}) = 14400\\,\\mathrm{N}$\n$M_f t_f^2 = (2.0 \\times 10^6) \\times (10 \\times 10^{-6}) = 20\\,\\mathrm{N}$\n\nPosition of the neutral axis $z_n$:\n$$ z_n = \\frac{20 - 14400}{2(4.8 \\times 10^7 + 2.0 \\times 10^6)} = \\frac{-14380}{2(5.0 \\times 10^7)} = -1.438 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\n\nDriving bending moment $M_{int}$:\nLever arm: $t_f/2 - z_n = (5 \\times 10^{-6}) - (-1.438 \\times 10^{-4}) = 1.488 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n$$ M_{int} = (300 \\times 10^6) \\times (10 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times (1.488 \\times 10^{-4}) = 0.4464\\,\\mathrm{N} $$\n\nComposite flexural rigidity $D_{comp}$:\nSubstrate contribution (rigidity about its own centroid + parallel axis term):\n$D_s = M_s \\frac{t_s^3}{12} + M_s t_s (z_n + \\frac{t_s}{2})^2 = (160 \\times 10^9) \\frac{(300 \\times 10^{-6})^3}{12} + (4.8 \\times 10^7) (-1.438 \\times 10^{-4} + 1.5 \\times 10^{-4})^2$\n$D_s = 0.36 + (4.8 \\times 10^7) (0.062 \\times 10^{-4})^2 = 0.36 + 0.00184512 = 0.36184512\\,\\mathrm{N \\cdot m}$\nFilm contribution (rigidity about its own centroid + parallel axis term):\n$D_f = M_f \\frac{t_f^3}{12} + M_f t_f (\\frac{t_f}{2} - z_n)^2 = (200 \\times 10^9) \\frac{(10 \\times 10^{-6})^3}{12} + (2.0 \\times 10^6) (1.488 \\times 10^{-4})^2$\n$D_f = 1.666... \\times 10^{-5} + 0.04428288 = 0.0442995... \\,\\mathrm{N \\cdot m}$\nTotal rigidity:\n$D_{comp} = D_s + D_f = 0.36184512 + 0.0442995... = 0.4061446... \\,\\mathrm{N \\cdot m}$\n\nFinally, the corrected curvature:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{corrected}} = \\frac{M_{int}}{D_{comp}} = \\frac{0.4464}{0.4061446...} \\approx 1.099125\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1} $$\nRounded to four significant figures, $k_{\\mathrm{corrected}} = 1.099\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$.\n\n**Ratio of Curvatures:**\n$$ \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{corrected}}}{k_{\\mathrm{Stoney}}} = \\frac{1.099125...}{1.25} \\approx 0.87930 $$\nRounded to four significant figures, the ratio is $0.8793$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an expression for thin film stress based on substrate curvature, followed by a first-order uncertainty analysis based on provided measurement uncertainties. The problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of solid mechanics and statistics and is well-posed. We shall proceed with the solution in two main parts.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Film Stress Formula (Stoney's Formula)\n\nThe foundation of this analysis is Kirchhoff-Love plate theory (KLPT) for isotropic thin plates. For a plate subjected to uniform biaxial bending, the bending moment per unit length, $M$, is related to the curvature, $\\kappa$. In the case of spherical bending, the curvatures in the principal directions are equal, i.e., $\\kappa_x = \\kappa_y = \\kappa$.\n\nThe moment-curvature relationships for an isotropic plate are:\n$$M_x = D (\\kappa_x + \\nu_s \\kappa_y)$$\n$$M_y = D (\\kappa_y + \\nu_s \\kappa_x)$$\nwhere $D$ is the flexural rigidity of the substrate, given by:\n$$D = \\frac{E_s t_s^3}{12(1-\\nu_s^2)}$$\nHere, $E_s$ is the Young's modulus of the substrate, $\\nu_s$ is its Poisson's ratio, and $t_s$ is its thickness.\n\nFor spherical curvature ($\\kappa_x = \\kappa_y = \\kappa$), the moments are also equal, $M_x = M_y = M$:\n$$M = D (\\kappa + \\nu_s \\kappa) = D \\kappa (1+\\nu_s)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $D$:\n$$M = \\frac{E_s t_s^3}{12(1-\\nu_s^2)} \\kappa (1+\\nu_s) = \\frac{E_s t_s^3}{12(1-\\nu_s)(1+\\nu_s)} \\kappa (1+\\nu_s)$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$M = \\frac{E_s t_s^3}{12(1-\\nu_s)} \\kappa$$\nThe term $E_s / (1-\\nu_s)$ is known as the biaxial modulus of the substrate.\n\nNext, we relate this internal bending moment to the stress in the deposited thin film, $\\sigma_f$. The film is assumed to have a uniform, equibiaxial stress. This stress gives rise to a force per unit length, $F$, acting along the perimeter of any section of the film:\n$$F = \\sigma_f t_f$$\nwhere $t_f$ is the film thickness.\n\nThis force, exerted by the film on the substrate, creates the bending moment $M$. Under the assumption that the film thickness is much smaller than the substrate thickness ($t_f \\ll t_s$), the neutral axis of the composite structure lies approximately at the geometric mid-plane of the substrate. The moment arm for the force $F$ is therefore the distance from the mid-plane of the film to the mid-plane of the substrate, which is approximately $\\frac{t_s}{2}$.\n\nThe bending moment per unit length induced by the film stress is thus:\n$$M = F \\times (\\text{moment arm}) \\approx (\\sigma_f t_f) \\left(\\frac{t_s}{2}\\right)$$\n\nEquating the two expressions for the bending moment $M$:\n$$\\sigma_f \\frac{t_f t_s}{2} = \\frac{E_s t_s^3}{12(1-\\nu_s)} \\kappa$$\n\nFinally, we solve for the film stress $\\sigma_f$:\n$$\\sigma_f = \\frac{2}{t_f t_s} \\frac{E_s t_s^3}{12(1-\\nu_s)} \\kappa$$\n$$\\sigma_f = \\frac{E_s t_s^2}{6(1-\\nu_s)t_f} \\kappa$$\nThis is the required expression, commonly known as Stoney's formula.\n\n### Part 2: First-Order Uncertainty Propagation\n\nWe have the function for film stress $\\sigma_f = \\sigma_f(E_s, \\nu_s, t_s, t_f, \\kappa)$. The first-order (linearized) approximation for the variance of $\\sigma_f$, assuming the input variables are independent, is given by:\n$$(\\delta \\sigma_f)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_f}{\\partial E_s} \\delta E_s\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_f}{\\partial \\nu_s} \\delta \\nu_s\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_f}{\\partial t_s} \\delta t_s\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_f}{\\partial t_f} \\delta t_f\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_f}{\\partial \\kappa} \\delta \\kappa\\right)^2$$\n\nIt is more convenient to work with relative uncertainties. Dividing by $\\sigma_f^2$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\delta \\sigma_f}{\\sigma_f}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sigma_f}\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_f}{\\partial E_s} \\delta E_s\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sigma_f}\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_f}{\\partial \\nu_s} \\delta \\nu_s\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sigma_f}\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_f}{\\partial t_s} \\delta t_s\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sigma_f}\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_f}{\\partial t_f} \\delta t_f\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sigma_f}\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_f}{\\partial \\kappa} \\delta \\kappa\\right)^2$$\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_f}{\\partial E_s} = \\frac{\\sigma_f}{E_s}$, $\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_f}{\\partial \\nu_s} = \\frac{\\sigma_f}{1-\\nu_s}$, $\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_f}{\\partial t_s} = \\frac{2\\sigma_f}{t_s}$, $\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_f}{\\partial t_f} = -\\frac{\\sigma_f}{t_f}$, $\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_f}{\\partial \\kappa} = \\frac{\\sigma_f}{\\kappa}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the variance equation gives a simplified expression for the total relative uncertainty:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\delta \\sigma_f}{\\sigma_f}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\delta E_s}{E_s}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\delta \\nu_s}{1-\\nu_s}\\right)^2 + \\left(2\\frac{\\delta t_s}{t_s}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\delta t_f}{t_f}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\delta \\kappa}{\\kappa}\\right)^2$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the nominal value of $\\sigma_f$ using the provided data in SI units:\n$E_s = 130\\,\\mathrm{GPa} = 130 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n$\\nu_s = 0.28$\n$t_s = 775\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m} = 775 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$t_f = 100\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 100 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$\\kappa = 0.005\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$\n\n$$\\sigma_f = \\frac{(130 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Pa}) (775 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}{6(1-0.28)(100 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m})} (0.005\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1})$$\n$$\\sigma_f = \\frac{(1.3 \\times 10^{11}) (6.00625 \\times 10^{-7})}{6(0.72)(1 \\times 10^{-7})} (5 \\times 10^{-3}) = \\frac{7.808125 \\times 10^4}{4.32 \\times 10^{-7}} (5 \\times 10^{-3})$$\n$$\\sigma_f \\approx (1.807436 \\times 10^{11}) \\times (5 \\times 10^{-3}) \\approx 9.03718 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = 903.718\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the individual squared relative uncertainty terms using the given uncertainties:\n$\\delta E_s/E_s = 2\\% = 0.02$\n$\\delta \\nu_s = 0.01$\n$\\delta t_s = 1\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m} = 1 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$\\delta t_f = 5\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 5 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$\\delta \\kappa = 1\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$\n\n1.  Term from $E_s$: $\\left(\\frac{\\delta E_s}{E_s}\\right)^2 = (0.02)^2 = 0.0004$\n2.  Term from $\\nu_s$: $\\left(\\frac{\\delta \\nu_s}{1-\\nu_s}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{0.01}{1-0.28}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{0.01}{0.72}\\right)^2 \\approx (0.013889)^2 \\approx 1.929 \\times 10^{-4}$\n3.  Term from $t_s$: $\\left(2\\frac{\\delta t_s}{t_s}\\right)^2 = \\left(2 \\times \\frac{1 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}}{775 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{2}{775}\\right)^2 \\approx (0.002581)^2 \\approx 6.659 \\times 10^{-6}$\n4.

The other sources of uncertainty are negligible in comparison.\nThe relative uncertainty in $\\sigma_f$ is:\n$$\\frac{\\delta \\sigma_f}{\\sigma_f} = \\sqrt{40000.0031} \\approx 200.0$$\nThe absolute uncertainty $\\delta \\sigma_f$ is then:\n$$\\delta \\sigma_f = \\sigma_f \\times \\frac{\\delta \\sigma_f}{\\sigma_f} \\approx (903.718\\,\\mathrm{MPa}) \\times 200.0 \\approx 180744\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$$\nRounding to 3 significant figures, the absolute uncertainty is $1.81 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$.",
