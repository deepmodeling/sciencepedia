The total stress observed in a deposited film is a superposition of intrinsic stress, which arises from the growth process itself, and thermal stress, which develops due to the mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients between the film and substrate during temperature changes.

This can be expressed as:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{total}} = \\sigma_{\\text{int}} + \\sigma_{\\text{th}}\n$$\nThe problem states that the film is deposited at a constant temperature $T_{\\mathrm{dep}} = 800\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. Immediately after deposition, at this temperature, there has been no temperature change, so the thermal expansion mismatch has not yet contributed to the stress. Therefore, the thermal stress component is zero, $\\sigma_{\\text{th}} = 0$. The stress present in the film at the deposition temperature is purely the intrinsic stress:\n$$\n\\sigma_f(T_{\\mathrm{dep}}) = \\sigma_{\\text{int}}\n$$\nTo determine this stress, we can use the measured wafer curvature, $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{dep}}$. The relationship between the equi-biaxial stress in a thin film, $\\sigma_f$, and the curvature of the much thicker substrate, $\\kappa$, is given by the Stoney equation. As required, we derive this relation from first principles.\n\nA uniform biaxial stress $\\sigma_f$ in a film of thickness $t_f$ generates a force per unit width of $F_f = \\sigma_f t_f$. This force is exerted on the substrate, which must develop an opposing force to maintain mechanical equilibrium. This pair of forces, separated by a distance related to the film and substrate thicknesses, creates a bending moment $M$ that causes the wafer to curve. For a thin film where $t_f \\ll t_s$, the lever arm between the central plane of the film and the central plane of the substrate is approximately $t_s/2$. The bending moment per unit width is thus:\n$$\nM \\approx F_f \\left(\\frac{t_s}{2}\\right) = (\\sigma_f t_f) \\frac{t_s}{2}\n$$\nFrom the theory of plate bending under biaxial loading, the relationship between the applied bending moment $M$ and the resulting curvature $\\kappa$ for a plate (the substrate) is given by:\n$$\nM = \\frac{E_s t_s^3}{12(1-\\nu_s)} \\kappa\n$$\nHere, $E_s$, $\\nu_s$, and $t_s$ are the Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and thickness of the substrate, respectively.\nEquating the two expressions for the moment $M$ yields:\n$$\n(\\sigma_f t_f) \\frac{t_s}{2} = \\frac{E_s t_s^3}{12(1-\\nu_s)} \\kappa\n$$\nSolving for the film stress $\\sigma_f$, we obtain the Stoney equation:\n$$\n\\sigma_f = \\frac{E_s}{1-\\nu_s} \\frac{t_s^2}{6 t_f} \\kappa\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{E_s}{1-\\nu_s}$ is the biaxial modulus of the substrate, denoted as $M_s$.

The Al-on-Si system is a canonical case study, and the parameter values are realistic.\n- **Well-Posed:** The objective is to evaluate and select the best experimental design from a list of options to achieve a specific, well-defined scientific goal (decoupling stress components).

It represents a a legitimate and non-trivial problem in experimental materials science.\n**Verdict:** The problem is **valid**. Proceeding to solution.\n\n### Derivation of Solution Principles\nThe goal is to design an experiment that separates the total measured film stress, $\\sigma_f$, into its constituent parts: intrinsic stress ($\\sigma_{\\mathrm{int}}$), thermo-elastic stress ($\\sigma_{\\mathrm{th}}(T)$), and stress relaxed by creep ($\\sigma_{\\mathrm{cr}}$). The key is to exploit the different dependencies of each component.\n\n1.  **Intrinsic Stress ($\\sigma_{\\mathrm{int}}$):** This stress component is generated during the film growth process itself. It is established at the deposition temperature $T_d$ and, assuming no subsequent microstructural changes, acts as a constant offset throughout the thermal cycle. At the moment deposition finishes ($t=0$) and the sample is at temperature $T_d$, there is no thermal mismatch strain ($\\int_{T_d}^{T_d} \\dots = 0$) and no time has elapsed for creep to occur. Thus, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{th}}(T_d) = 0$ and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{cr}}(T_d) = 0$. The stress decomposition simplifies to $\\sigma_f(T_d, t=0) = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{int}}$. Therefore, an in-situ stress measurement immediately after deposition at $T_d$ directly measures $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{int}}$.\n\n2.  **Thermo-elastic Stress ($\\sigma_{\\mathrm{th}}(T)$):** This component arises purely from the differential thermal expansion between the film and substrate and the elastic response of the film. It depends only on the temperature difference $(T_d - T)$ and the material properties, not on the thermal history (i.e., the cooling rate $\\dot{T}$).\n\n3.  **Creep Relaxation ($\\sigma_{\\mathrm{cr}}$):** Creep is a thermally activated, time-dependent process of plastic deformation. The amount of creep strain, and thus the magnitude of stress relaxation $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{cr}}$, depends on the entire time-temperature-stress history of the cooldown. It is highly sensitive to the cooling rate $\\dot{T}$. A very fast cooldown (quench) minimizes the time available for creep, so $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{cr}} \\to 0$. A slow cooldown or an isothermal hold at elevated temperature maximizes the opportunity for creep, leading to a significant $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{cr}}$.\n\n**Separation Strategy:**\nA robust protocol would involve a series of measurements designed to isolate each component:\n- **Measure $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{int}}$:** Perform an in-situ measurement at $T_d$ immediately post-deposition.\n- **Establish an Elastic Baseline:** Perform a rapid quench from $T_d$ to $T_0$. During this fast process, creep is suppressed ($\\sigma_{\\mathrm{cr}} \\approx 0$). The measured stress, $\\sigma_f(T)_{\\mathrm{quench}}$, provides the purely thermo-elastic response superimposed on the intrinsic stress: $\\sigma_f(T)_{\\mathrm{quench}} \\approx \\sigma_{\\mathrm{int}} + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{th}}(T)$.\n- **Measure Creep Effects:** Perform a slow cooldown from $T_d$ to $T_0$. During this run, significant creep will occur. The measured stress will be $\\sigma_f(T)_{\\mathrm{slow}} = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{int}} + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{th}}(T) - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{cr}}(T)$.\n- **Isolate $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{cr}}$:** By comparing the two runs, the creep relaxation at any temperature $T$ can be isolated: $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{cr}}(T) = \\sigma_f(T)_{\\mathrm{quench}} - \\sigma_f(T)_{\\mathrm{slow}}$.\n- **Characterize Creep Law:** To determine the creep parameters ($A$, $n$, $Q$), it is necessary to measure the rate of creep. Isothermal holds at various temperatures are ideal for this. During a hold, $\\dot{T}=0$, so the thermal strain rate is zero. Any change in stress is due to stress relaxation via creep. The rate of stress relaxation, $\\dot{\\sigma}_f$, can be measured and related to the creep law: $\\dot{\\sigma}_f \\approx -M_f \\dot{\\epsilon}_{\\mathrm{cr}} = -M_f A \\sigma_f^n \\exp(-Q/RT)$. By measuring $\\dot{\\sigma}_f$ at various temperatures and stress levels, the parameters can be extracted through fitting.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Measure wafer curvature at $T_d$ immediately after deposition to establish $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{int}}$ via the Stoney equation. Perform two cooldown sequences while recording $\\kappa(T,t)$ continuously: (i) a high-rate quench from $T_d$ to $T_0$ at $\\dot{T} \\geq 50\\,\\mathrm{K}/\\mathrm{min}$, and (ii) a slow ramp at $\\dot{T} \\approx 1\\,\\mathrm{K}/\\mathrm{min}$ with isothermal holds of duration $30\\,\\mathrm{min}$ at several temperatures between $T_d$ and $T_0$. Use the quench to approximate $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{cr}} \\approx 0$ and thereby obtain $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{int}} + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{th}}(T)$; use the slow ramp and holds to quantify $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{cr}}(T,\\dot{T})$ by comparing the stress to the quench run and by fitting $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{\\mathrm{cr}}(T,\\sigma)$ to extract $A$, $n$, and $Q$. Subtracting $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{int}}$ isolates the thermal mismatch term, while the difference between the quench and slow schedules isolates creep accumulated during cooldown.**\nThis protocol is a textbook implementation of the separation strategy derived above. It correctly identifies how to measure $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{int}}$ directly. It uses a high-rate quench to establish the elastic baseline, which is critical. It uses a slow ramp to allow creep to occur and isothermal holds to precisely characterize the creep kinetics. The comparison between the fast and slow runs correctly isolates the total accumulated creep relaxation. This is a comprehensive and methodologically sound approach.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. After deposition, cool at a single moderate ramp rate of $\\dot{T} \\approx 10\\,\\mathrm{K}/\\mathrm{min}$ to $T_0$ and measure only the final residual stress at $T_0$ by X-ray diffraction lattice-strain methods, assuming intrinsic stress is negligible if the film is allowed to rest at $T_0$ for $2\\,\\mathrm{h}$.**\nThis protocol is deeply flawed. Firstly, cooling at a single moderate rate conflates all stress components into one unresolvable measurement at the end. It is impossible to decouple $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{int}}$, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{th}}$, and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{cr}}$ from a single data point. Secondly, the assumption that $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{int}}$ is negligible is unjustified; intrinsic stress is often a significant component of the total stress. Thirdly, allowing the film to rest at $T_0 = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$ (room temperature) for $2\\,\\mathrm{h}$ will not cause significant stress relaxation. Creep in aluminum is a high-temperature phenomenon, governed by the Arrhenius term $\\exp(-Q/RT)$, and is exceedingly slow at room temperature. The intrinsic stress would not be affected.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Deposit aluminum films of two thicknesses, $t_f$ and $2 t_f$, on silicon, cool both at the same slow ramp rate, and compare the measured curvatures to infer the role of creep from thickness scaling. Assume that Stoney’s proportionality cancels intrinsic stress contributions when thickness is doubled.**\nThis protocol is based on a specious assumption. The Stoney equation relates stress and curvature via $\\sigma_f \\propto \\kappa/t_f$. There is no principle that suggests intrinsic stress contributions would be canceled by doubling the film thickness. Intrinsic stress can itself be a function of thickness, and more importantly, the creep behavior can also change with thickness due to changes in microstructure (e.g., grain size effects). Comparing two samples cooled at the same slow rate provides two data sets where $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{int}}$ and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{cr}}$ are convolved. There is no clear path to deconvolution. The assumption of cancellation is baseless.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Apply cyclic thermal loading between $T_0$ and $T_d$ for $10$ cycles at $\\dot{T} \\approx 10\\,\\mathrm{K}/\\mathrm{min}$ without isothermal holds, and average the stress-temperature hysteresis over cycles to estimate and subtract an “effective” intrinsic contribution, attributing the remaining hysteresis to creep.**\nWhile thermal cycling experiments are used to study plasticity, this protocol is not suitable for the stated goal. The goal is to separate the *initial* $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{int}}$ from the creep that occurs during the *first cooldown*. Cyclic loading will induce plastic deformation (creep) during both heating and cooling, and can also lead to microstructural evolution (work hardening or softening), which changes the material's properties over time. The concept of an \"effective\" intrinsic contribution obtained by averaging is vague and not well-founded. This method loses information about the initial state and conflates it with cyclic effects, making it far less direct and less accurate than protocol A.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

Derive and implement a time-integration algorithm to predict the stress evolution over the wafer radius and over time.\n\nStart from the following fundamental bases:\n\n- Linear thermoelasticity for small strains: the total strain is the sum of mechanical strain and thermal strain. For a film under plane stress, the biaxial modulus is $M = E_f/(1 - \\nu_f)$, where $E_f$ is the film elastic modulus and $\\nu_f$ is the film Poisson ratio.\n- Maxwell viscoelastic constitutive law under imposed strain: for a uniaxial representation, the relation between stress $ \\sigma $ and mechanical strain $ \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{mech}} $ is $ \\frac{d \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{mech}}}{dt} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\eta_f} + \\frac{1}{E_f} \\frac{d \\sigma}{dt} $, where $ \\eta_f $ is the film viscosity. Under plane stress, replace $E_f$ by $M$.\n- Thermally induced mismatch strain rate under rigid in-plane constraint: $ \\frac{d \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{th}}}{dt} = \\left( \\alpha_f(T) - \\alpha_s(T) \\right) \\frac{dT}{dt} $, where $ \\alpha_f(T) $ and $ \\alpha_s(T) $ are the temperature-dependent linear coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) of the film and substrate, respectively.\n- Lumped thermal energy balance: the wafer temperature follows $ \\frac{d T_{\\mathrm{lump}}}{dt} = \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{set}}(t) - T_{\\mathrm{lump}}(t)}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{th}}} $, where $ T_{\\mathrm{set}}(t) $ is the heater setpoint and $ \\tau_{\\mathrm{th}} $ is the thermal time constant. The nonuniform spatial temperature field is represented by $ T(r,t) = T_{\\mathrm{amb}} + w(r)\\left[T_{\\mathrm{lump}}(t) - T_{\\mathrm{amb}}\\right] $, where $ T_{\\mathrm{amb}} $ is the ambient temperature and $ w(r) $ is a dimensionless radial weighting function describing nonuniform lamp intensity.\n\nUsing these bases, derive the governing ordinary differential equation for the local film stress $ \\sigma(r,t) $ as a function of time under the constraint of zero total in-plane strain, and implement a numerical solver to simulate a complete thermal cycle comprising pre-dwell at ambient, ramp-up, peak dwell, ramp-down, and post-dwell at ambient. The heater setpoint is defined by piecewise linear segments:\n- Pre-dwell: $ T_{\\mathrm{set}}(t) = T_{\\mathrm{amb}} $ for $ 0 \\le t  t_{\\mathrm{pre}} $.\n- Ramp-up: $ T_{\\mathrm{set}}(t) = T_{\\mathrm{amb}} + R_{\\uparrow}(t - t_{\\mathrm{pre}}) $ for $ t_{\\mathrm{pre}} \\le t  t_{\\mathrm{pre}} + t_{\\uparrow} $, with $ t_{\\uparrow} = \\frac{T_{\\max} - T_{\\mathrm{amb}}}{R_{\\uparrow}} $.\n- Peak dwell: $ T_{\\mathrm{set}}(t) = T_{\\max} $ for $ t_{\\mathrm{pre}} + t_{\\uparrow} \\le t  t_{\\mathrm{pre}} + t_{\\uparrow} + t_{\\mathrm{peak}} $.\n- Ramp-down: $ T_{\\mathrm{set}}(t) = T_{\\max} - R_{\\downarrow}\\left(t - t_{\\mathrm{pre}} - t_{\\uparrow} - t_{\\mathrm{peak}}\\right) $ for $ t_{\\mathrm{pre}} + t_{\\uparrow} + t_{\\mathrm{peak}} \\le t  t_{\\mathrm{pre}} + t_{\\uparrow} + t_{\\mathrm{peak}} + t_{\\downarrow} $, with $ t_{\\downarrow} = \\frac{T_{\\max} - T_{\\mathrm{amb}}}{R_{\\downarrow}} $.\n- Post-dwell: $ T_{\\mathrm{set}}(t) = T_{\\mathrm{amb}} $ for $ t_{\\mathrm{pre}} + t_{\\uparrow} + t_{\\mathrm{peak}} + t_{\\downarrow} \\le t  t_{\\mathrm{end}} $, where $ t_{\\mathrm{end}} = t_{\\mathrm{pre}} + t_{\\uparrow} + t_{\\mathrm{peak}} + t_{\\downarrow} + t_{\\mathrm{post}} $.\n\nAssume the lamp nonuniformity is $ w(r) = \\max\\left(0, \\min\\left(1, 1 - \\beta \\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right)^2 \\right)\\right) $, where $ R $ is the wafer radius and $ \\beta $ is a nonuniformity parameter. Let the temperature-dependent coefficients of thermal expansion be linear in temperature: $ \\alpha_f(T) = a_{f0} + a_{f1} T $ and $ \\alpha_s(T) = a_{s0} + a_{s1} T $, with $ a_{f0} $ and $ a_{s0} $ in $ \\mathrm{K^{-1}} $ and $ a_{f1} $ and $ a_{s1} $ in $ \\mathrm{K^{-2}} $. The initial film stress is a uniform intrinsic value $ \\sigma_0 $ at $ t = 0 $.\n\nYour program must:\n- Discretize the wafer radius $ r \\in [0, R] $ with a uniform grid of $ N $ points, including center $ r = 0 $ and edge $ r = R $.\n- Integrate the lumped thermal equation for $ T_{\\mathrm{lump}}(t) $ using an explicit time step $ \\Delta t $.\n- At each time step, compute $ T(r,t) $, $ \\frac{dT(r,t)}{dt} $, and the mismatch CTE $ \\Delta \\alpha(T) = \\alpha_f(T) - \\alpha_s(T) $.\n- Integrate the Maxwell stress evolution at each radial node using an explicit time step based on the derived ordinary differential equation.\n- Track the maximum absolute stress magnitude across all nodes and times during the cycle.\n- Report the final center stress $ \\sigma(r=0, t_{\\mathrm{end}}) $, the final edge stress $ \\sigma(r=R, t_{\\mathrm{end}}) $, and the maximum absolute stress magnitude over the entire cycle. Express all stresses in $ \\mathrm{MPa} $ as floating-point numbers rounded to three decimals.\n\nUse the following test suite of parameter sets to evaluate the solver. All parameters are scientifically plausible and provided in consistent units:\n\nCommon parameters for all tests:\n- Wafer radius $ R = 0.075 \\ \\mathrm{m} $.\n- Number of radial points $ N = 101 $.\n- Ambient temperature $ T_{\\mathrm{amb}} = 300 \\ \\mathrm{K} $.\n- Initial intrinsic stress $ \\sigma_0 = -200 \\ \\mathrm{MPa} $.\n- Film elastic modulus $ E_f = 180 \\ \\mathrm{GPa} $.\n- Film Poisson ratio $ \\nu_f = 0.23 $.\n- Film and substrate CTE coefficients: $ a_{f0} = 3.3 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{K^{-1}} $, $ a_{f1} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{K^{-2}} $, $ a_{s0} = 2.6 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{K^{-1}} $, $ a_{s1} = 0.9 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{K^{-2}} $.\n- Time step $ \\Delta t = 0.01 \\ \\mathrm{s} $.\n\nTest cases:\n1.

            "solution": "The problem is deemed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of continuum mechanics and heat transfer, mathematically well-posed as an initial value problem for a system of ordinary differential equations, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first deriving the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the local in-plane stress, $\\sigma(r,t)$, and then devising a numerical integration scheme to solve it coupled with the thermal evolution of the wafer.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Governing Stress ODE**\n\nThe fundamental premise is the decomposition of the total in-plane strain, $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{total}}$, into a mechanical (elastic and viscous) component, $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{mech}}$, and a thermal component, $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{th}}$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{mech}} + \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{th}} $$\nThe problem states that due to the rigid bonding to a thick substrate, the local total in-plane strain in the film is zero. This is a common modeling simplification where the substrate serves as the frame of reference. This constraint implies that the total strain rate is also zero:\n$$ \\frac{d\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{total}}}{dt} = \\frac{d\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{mech}}}{dt} + \\frac{d\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{th}}}{dt} = 0 $$\nFrom this, we find that the mechanical strain rate is equal and opposite to the thermal strain rate:\n$$ \\frac{d\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{mech}}}{dt} = - \\frac{d\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{th}}}{dt} $$\nThe thermal strain, $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{th}}$, is interpreted as the thermal mismatch strain between the film and the substrate. Its rate of change is given by the product of the difference in the coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE), $\\Delta\\alpha(T) = \\alpha_f(T) - \\alpha_s(T)$, and the rate of temperature change, $\\frac{dT}{dt}$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{th}}}{dt} = \\Delta\\alpha(T) \\frac{dT}{dt} $$\nSubstituting this into the strain rate balance gives the required mechanical strain rate:\n$$ \\frac{d\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{mech}}}{dt} = - \\Delta\\alpha(T) \\frac{dT}{dt} $$\nThe constitutive behavior of the film is described by the Maxwell model for a linear viscoelastic solid under plane stress. The problem provides the uniaxial relation and instructs to replace the Young's modulus, $E_f$, with the biaxial modulus, $M = E_f/(1-\\nu_f)$, for plane stress conditions. The resulting constitutive law is:\n$$ \\frac{d\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{mech}}}{dt} = \\frac{1}{M} \\frac{d\\sigma}{dt} + \\frac{\\sigma}{\\eta_f} $$\nHere, $\\sigma$ is the in-plane biaxial stress, and $\\eta_f$ is the film viscosity. The first term on the right-hand side represents the elastic strain rate, and the second term represents the viscous strain rate (creep).\n\nBy equating the two expressions for $\\frac{d\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{mech}}}{dt}$, we couple the mechanical response to the thermal load:\n$$ \\frac{1}{M} \\frac{d\\sigma}{dt} + \\frac{\\sigma}{\\eta_f} = - \\Delta\\alpha(T) \\frac{dT}{dt} $$\nRearranging this equation to solve for the stress rate, $\\frac{d\\sigma}{dt}$, yields the final governing ODE for the stress at a specific radial location $r$ and time $t$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\sigma(r,t)}{dt} = - \\frac{M}{\\eta_f} \\sigma(r,t) - M \\Delta\\alpha(T(r,t)) \\frac{dT(r,t)}{dt} $$\nThis is a first-order linear ODE where the first term on the right describes stress relaxation due to viscosity and the second term describes stress generation due to thermoelastic mismatch.\n\n**2. Thermal Model and Coupling**\n\nThe stress ODE depends on the local temperature $T(r,t)$ and its time derivative $\\frac{dT(r,t)}{dt}$. These are determined by the specified thermal model. The wafer's overall thermal response is described by a lumped-parameter model:\n$$ \\frac{dT_{\\mathrm{lump}}}{dt} = \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{set}}(t) - T_{\\mathrm{lump}}(t)}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{th}}} $$\nwhere $T_{\\mathrm{lump}}(t)$ is the characteristic wafer temperature, $T_{\\mathrm{set}}(t)$ is the heater setpoint temperature profile, and $\\tau_{\\mathrm{th}}$ is the thermal time constant. The spatially nonuniform temperature field $T(r,t)$ is related to $T_{\\mathrm{lump}}(t)$ via a dimensionless weighting function $w(r)$:\n$$ T(r,t) = T_{\\mathrm{amb}} + w(r) \\left[ T_{\\mathrm{lump}}(t) - T_{\\mathrm{amb}} \\right] $$\nTo find the local temperature rate, we differentiate this expression with respect to time:\n$$ \\frac{dT(r,t)}{dt} = w(r) \\frac{dT_{\\mathrm{lump}}(t)}{dt} = w(r) \\left( \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{set}}(t) - T_{\\mathrm{lump}}(t)}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{th}}} \\right) $$\nWith this, all terms in the stress ODE are defined. The problem is now a system of coupled first-order ODEs: one for $T_{\\mathrm{lump}}(t)$ and one for $\\sigma(r,t)$ at each discrete radial node.\n\n**3. Numerical Integration Scheme**\n\nThe system is solved using an explicit forward Euler time integration scheme with a fixed time step $\\Delta t$. The wafer is discretized into $N$ radial points $r_j$. The simulation proceeds as follows:\n\nInitial Conditions ($t=0$):\n- Assume the system starts in thermal equilibrium at ambient temperature: $T_{\\mathrm{lump}}(0) = T_{\\mathrm{amb}}$.\n- This implies the initial temperature is uniform across the wafer: $T(r_j, 0) = T_{\\mathrm{amb}}$.\n- The initial stress is the given uniform intrinsic stress: $\\sigma(r_j, 0) = \\sigma_0$.\n\nFor each time step from $t_i$ to $t_{i+1} = t_i + \\Delta t$:\n1. Determine the setpoint temperature $T_{\\mathrm{set}}(t_i)$ from the piecewise linear thermal cycle definition.\n2. Calculate the rate of change of the lumped temperature:\n   $$ k_T = \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{set}}(t_i) - T_{\\mathrm{lump}}(t_i)}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{th}}} $$\n3. For each radial node $r_j$:\n   a. Calculate the local temperature rate: $\\frac{dT}{dt}\\bigg|_{r_j, t_i} = w(r_j) k_T$.\n   b. Calculate the current local temperature: $T(r_j, t_i) = T_{\\mathrm{amb}} + w(r_j) [T_{\\mathrm{lump}}(t_i) - T_{\\mathrm{amb}}]$.\n   c. Calculate the CTE mismatch at this temperature: $\\Delta\\alpha(T(r_j,t_i)) = (a_{f0} - a_{s0}) + (a_{f1} - a_{s1}) T(r_j, t_i)$.\n   d. Calculate the stress rate:\n      $$ k_{\\sigma_j} = - \\frac{M}{\\eta_f} \\sigma(r_j, t_i) - M \\Delta\\alpha(T(r_j, t_i)) \\left( w(r_j) k_T \\right) $$\n   e. Update the stress at node $r_j$: $\\sigma(r_j, t_{i+1}) = \\sigma(r_j, t_i) + k_{\\sigma_j} \\Delta t$.\n4. Update the lumped temperature: $T_{\\mathrm{lump}}(t_{i+1}) = T_{\\mathrm{lump}}(t_i) + k_T \\Delta t$.\n5. Track the maximum absolute stress encountered across all nodes during the step:\n   $$ \\sigma_{max,abs} \\leftarrow \\max(\\sigma_{max,abs}, \\max_{j}|\\sigma(r_j, t_{i+1})|) $$\nThis process is repeated until the total simulation time $t_{\\mathrm{end}}$ is reached. Finally, the required outputs—final center stress $\\sigma(r=0, t_{\\mathrm{end}})$, final edge stress $\\sigma(r=R, t_{\\mathrm{end}})$, and the overall maximum absolute stress $\\sigma_{max,abs}$—are extracted and reported in MPa.\nAll calculations are performed using consistent SI units ($\\mathrm{m, s, K, Pa, Pa \\cdot s}$), with final stress values converted to megapascals ($\\mathrm{MPa}$) by dividing by $10^6$.",
