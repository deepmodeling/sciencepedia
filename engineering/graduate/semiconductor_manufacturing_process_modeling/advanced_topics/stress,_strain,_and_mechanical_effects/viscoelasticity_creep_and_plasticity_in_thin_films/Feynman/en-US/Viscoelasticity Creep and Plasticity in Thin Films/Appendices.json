            "problem": "A thin passivation film in a semiconductor wafer stack exhibits in-plane stress relaxation under a step-and-hold equi-biaxial strain, consistent with a single-relaxation-time viscoelastic response. Assume the film can be modeled by a Maxwell element consisting of a linear elastic spring with in-plane biaxial modulus $M(T)$ in series with a viscous dashpot of viscosity $\\eta(T)$. The relaxation is driven by thermally activated viscous flow characterized by a single activation energy $Q$ and a temperature-independent pre-exponential factor. Two stress relaxation experiments are performed at temperatures $T_1$ and $T_2$, and the time $t_{1/e}(T)$ for the stress to decay to $1/e$ of its initial value is recorded. The in-plane biaxial modulus is independently measured at each temperature.\n\nUsing only first principles of linear viscoelasticity and thermally activated rate processes, derive an expression to estimate the activation energy $Q$ from two relaxation measurements. Then evaluate $Q$ in two ways: (i) neglecting temperature variation of the modulus $M(T)$, and (ii) accounting for the measured change in $M(T)$ to isolate the viscosity.

The total strain rate $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon} = \\dot{\\varepsilon}_s + \\dot{\\varepsilon}_d\n$$\nThe stress $\\sigma$ is uniform throughout the series element. The constitutive equations for the spring and dashpot are:\n$$\n\\sigma = M \\varepsilon_s \\implies \\dot{\\varepsilon}_s = \\frac{1}{M} \\frac{d\\sigma}{dt}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma = \\eta \\dot{\\varepsilon}_d \\implies \\dot{\\varepsilon}_d = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\eta}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the total strain rate equation gives the governing differential equation for the Maxwell model:\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{1}{M} \\frac{d\\sigma}{dt} + \\frac{\\sigma}{\\eta}\n$$\nFor a stress relaxation test, a constant strain $\\varepsilon_0$ is applied at $t=0$ and held constant for $t > 0$. Therefore, the total strain rate $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$ is zero for $t > 0$. The differential equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{M} \\frac{d\\sigma}{dt} + \\frac{\\sigma}{\\eta} = 0 \\implies \\frac{d\\sigma}{dt} = -\\frac{M}{\\eta} \\sigma\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for stress $\\sigma(t)$. The solution is an exponential decay:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{M}{\\eta} t\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_0$ is the initial stress at $t=0$. The characteristic relaxation time, $\\tau$, is defined as $\\tau = \\eta/M$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that $t_{1/e}$ is the time at which the stress decays to $1/e$ of its initial value, i.e., $\\sigma(t_{1/e}) = \\sigma_0 / e = \\sigma_0 \\exp(-1)$. By comparison with the solution, we see that $t_{1/e} / \\tau = 1$, which means the measured relaxation time is equal to the characteristic relaxation time of the material at that temperature:\n$$\nt_{1/e}(T) = \\tau(T) = \\frac{\\eta(T)}{M(T)}\n$$\nThe viscosity $\\eta(T)$ is described by a thermally activated process (Arrhenius relation), where flow is facilitated by higher temperatures. Its dependence on temperature $T$ and activation energy $Q$ is given by:\n$$\n\\eta(T) = \\eta_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{Q}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\eta_0$ is a pre-exponential factor and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nWe can now write expressions for the relaxation time $\\tau$ at the two temperatures $T_1$ and $T_2$:\n$$\n\\tau(T_1) = \\frac{\\eta_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{Q}{k_B T_1}\\right)}{M(T_1)}\n$$\n$$\n\\tau(T_2) = \\frac{\\eta_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{Q}{k_B T_2}\\right)}{M(T_2)}\n$$\nTo find $Q$, we can eliminate the unknown pre-factor $\\eta_0$ by taking the ratio of these two equations:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau(T_1)}{\\tau(T_2)} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(\\frac{Q}{k_B T_1}\\right) / M(T_1)}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{Q}{k_B T_2}\\right) / M(T_2)} = \\frac{M(T_2)}{M(T_1)} \\exp\\left[\\frac{Q}{k_B} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2}\\right)\\right]\n$$\nTo solve for $Q$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\tau(T_1)}{\\tau(T_2)}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{M(T_2)}{M(T_1)}\\right) + \\frac{Q}{k_B} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2}\\right)\n$$\nRearranging the terms yields the general expression for the activation energy $Q$:\n$$\nQ = k_B \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\tau(T_1)}{\\tau(T_2)}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{M(T_2)}{M(T_1)}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2}\\right)} = k_B \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\tau(T_1) M(T_1)}{\\tau(T_2) M(T_2)}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2}\\right)}\n$$\nThis is the required expression. From the relation $\\tau(T) = \\eta(T)/M(T)$, we see that $\\eta(T) = \\tau(T) M(T)$. The numerator term $\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\tau(T_1) M(T_1)}{\\tau(T_2) M(T_2)}\\right)$ is simply $\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\eta(T_1)}{\\eta(T_2)}\\right)$, which isolates the activation energy of the viscous flow process, as intended.\n\n**(i) Evaluation of $Q$ neglecting temperature variation of the modulus.**\nIn this case, we assume $M(T_1) = M(T_2)$, so the term $\\ln\\left(M(T_2)/M(T_1)\\right) = \\ln(1) = 0$.

            "problem": "A polycrystalline thin metallic film used in semiconductor interconnects is subjected to a thermal anneal at absolute temperature $T$. Its grains are equiaxed, and the grain size $d$ follows a log-normal distribution, i.e., $\\ln d$ is normally distributed with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^{2}$, where $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of $\\ln d$. The film undergoes diffusive creep driven by a uniaxial tensile stress $\\sigma$ (stress symbol reused; the distribution width retains the notation $\\sigma$ for the standard deviation of $\\ln d$). Two diffusion paths are operative: volume diffusion and grain boundary diffusion. The volume diffusion coefficient is $D_{v}(T) = D_{v0} \\exp\\!\\left( -\\frac{Q_{v}}{k_{B} T} \\right)$, and the grain boundary diffusion coefficient is $D_{gb}(T) = D_{gb0} \\exp\\!\\left( -\\frac{Q_{gb}}{k_{B} T} \\right)$, where $D_{v0}$ and $D_{gb0}$ are pre-exponential factors, $Q_{v}$ and $Q_{gb}$ are activation energies, and $k_{B}$ is Boltzmann’s constant.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of materials science and solid-state physics, specifically the theory of diffusion creep. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to derive a unique solution. The reuse of the symbol $\\sigma$ for both stress and the standard deviation of the logarithm of the grain size is noted, but this ambiguity is resolved as the stress term cancels during the derivation, leaving only the statistical parameter $\\sigma$ in the final result.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two main parts: first, the derivation of the scaling laws for Nabarro-Herring and Coble creep, and second, the calculation of the crossover median grain size based on the ensemble average of these creep rates over the specified grain size distribution.\n\n**Part 1: Scaling of Diffusive Creep Rates**\n\nDiffusive creep is driven by the flux of atoms in response to a chemical potential gradient established by an applied stress. For a uniaxial tensile stress, denoted here as $\\sigma_{app}$ to distinguish it from the statistical parameter $\\sigma$, the chemical potential difference between grain boundaries oriented perpendicular and parallel to the stress axis is approximately $\\Delta\\mu \\approx \\sigma_{app} \\Omega$, where $\\Omega$ is the atomic volume. This potential difference drives atom diffusion over a characteristic length scale of the grain size, $d$.\n\nThe general strain rate, $\\dot{\\epsilon}$, can be related to the net atomic flux, $J_{atom}$. The flux is driven by the gradient of the chemical potential. Using a simplified model, the flux of atoms per unit area is given by Fick’s first law, driven by a concentration gradient that arises from the stress. A more direct relation based on irreversible thermodynamics gives the flux as $J_{atom} \\approx \\frac{D_{eff}}{k_B T \\Omega} \\nabla \\mu$. Approximating the gradient as $\\nabla\\mu \\approx \\frac{\\Delta\\mu}{d} = \\frac{\\sigma_{app}\\Omega}{d}$, we get:\n$$\nJ_{atom} \\approx \\frac{D_{eff} \\sigma_{app}}{d k_B T}\n$$\nwhere $D_{eff}$ is the effective diffusion coefficient for the dominant transport path. The strain rate is the rate of elongation per unit length. The elongation rate of a grain is the volume of material transported per unit time divided by the grain's cross-sectional area.\n$$\n\\dot{\\epsilon} = \\frac{\\dot{d}}{d} = \\frac{1}{d} \\frac{J_{atom} \\times A_{path}}{A_{grain}} = \\frac{J_{atom} A_{path}}{d^3}\n$$\nwhere $A_{path}$ is the cross-sectional area of the diffusion path and $A_{grain} \\approx d^2$. A more formal derivation accounts for geometry and vacancy concentrations, yielding expressions with a dimensionless prefactor.\n\n**Nabarro-Herring (NH) Creep:**\nIn Nabarro-Herring creep, mass transport occurs through the crystal lattice (volume diffusion).\n- Effective diffusion coefficient: $D_{eff} = D_v(T)$.\n- Diffusion path area is the grain itself: $A_{path} \\sim d^2$.\nThe strain rate $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{NH}$ is thus:\n$$\n\\dot{\\epsilon}_{NH}(d) = \\alpha_{NH} \\frac{D_v(T) \\Omega \\sigma_{app}}{d^2 k_B T}\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha_{NH}$ is a dimensionless geometric constant. The key scaling relationship derived from this is $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{NH} \\propto d^{-2}$.\n\n**Coble Creep:**\nIn Coble creep, mass transport occurs along the grain boundaries.\n- Effective diffusion coefficient: $D_{eff} = D_{gb}(T)$.\n- Diffusion path area is the perimeter of a grain cross-section times the grain boundary thickness $\\delta$: $A_{path} \\sim d\\delta$.\nThe strain rate $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{C}$ is:\n$$\n\\dot{\\epsilon}_{C}(d) = \\alpha_{C} \\frac{D_{gb}(T) \\delta \\Omega \\sigma_{app}}{d^3 k_B T}\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha_{C}$ is another dimensionless geometric constant. The key scaling relationship is $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{C} \\propto d^{-3}$.\n\n**Part 2: Crossover Median Grain Size Calculation**\n\nThe problem asks for the crossover median grain size $d^{\\dagger}$ at which the ensemble-averaged creep rates are equal.\n$$\n\\langle \\dot{\\epsilon}_{NH} \\rangle = \\langle \\dot{\\epsilon}_{C} \\rangle\n$$\nThe ensemble average of a function $f(d)$ is given by $\\langle f(d) \\rangle = \\int_0^\\infty f(d) P(d) \\, \\mathrm{d}d$, where $P(d)$ is the probability density function (PDF) of the grain size $d$.\n\nThe grain size $d$ follows a log-normal distribution, meaning $y = \\ln d$ is normally distributed with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$. The PDF for $d$ is:\n$$\nP(d) = \\frac{1}{d \\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{(\\ln d - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2} \\right)\n$$\nThe crossover condition is:\n$$\n\\left\\langle \\alpha_{NH} \\frac{D_v \\Omega \\sigma_{app}}{d^2 k_B T} \\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle \\alpha_{C} \\frac{D_{gb} \\delta \\Omega \\sigma_{app}}{d^3 k_B T} \\right\\rangle\n$$\nThe terms $\\Omega$, $\\sigma_{app}$, and $k_B T$ are constants with respect to the grain size $d$, so they can be factored out of the expectation.\n$$\n\\alpha_{NH} \\frac{D_v \\Omega \\sigma_{app}}{k_B T} \\langle d^{-2} \\rangle = \\alpha_{C} \\frac{D_{gb} \\delta \\Omega \\sigma_{app}}{k_B T} \\langle d^{-3} \\rangle\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{\\Omega \\sigma_{app}}{k_B T}$ cancels from both sides. To obtain a closed-form solution in terms of the given variables, we must assume the dimensionless geometric factors are equal, i.e., $\\alpha_{NH} = \\alpha_C$. This is a common assumption in scaling analyses when these factors are not provided. The condition simplifies to:\n$$\nD_v \\langle d^{-2} \\rangle = D_{gb} \\delta \\langle d^{-3} \\rangle\n$$\nNext, we compute the required moments of the inverse of the grain size, $\\langle d^k \\rangle$. For a log-normal distribution where $y = \\ln d \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$, the $k$-th moment of $d$ is given by:\n$$\n\\langle d^k \\rangle = \\langle \\exp(ky) \\rangle = \\exp\\left( k\\mu + \\frac{1}{2} k^2 \\sigma^2 \\right)\n$$\nWe need the moments for $k = -2$ and $k = -3$:\n$$\n\\langle d^{-2} \\rangle = \\exp\\left( -2\\mu + \\frac{1}{2} (-2)^2 \\sigma^2 \\right) = \\exp\\left( -2\\mu + 2\\sigma^2 \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\langle d^{-3} \\rangle = \\exp\\left( -3\\mu + \\frac{1}{2} (-3)^2 \\sigma^2 \\right) = \\exp\\left( -3\\mu + \\frac{9}{2}\\sigma^2 \\right)\n$$\nThe problem specifies the \"crossover median grain size,\" which we denote $d^{\\dagger}$. The median of a log-normal distribution is given by $d_{med} = \\exp(\\mu)$. Therefore, the parameter $\\mu$ is related to the median grain size by $\\mu = \\ln(d_{med})$. At the crossover point, $d_{med} = d^{\\dagger}$, so $\\mu = \\ln(d^{\\dagger})$.\nSubstituting $\\mu = \\ln(d^{\\dagger})$ into the moment expressions:\n$$\n\\langle d^{-2} \\rangle = \\exp\\left( -2\\ln(d^{\\dagger}) + 2\\sigma^2 \\right) = (d^{\\dagger})^{-2} \\exp(2\\sigma^2)\n$$\n$$\n\\langle d^{-3} \\rangle = \\exp\\left( -3\\ln(d^{\\dagger}) + \\frac{9}{2}\\sigma^2 \\right) = (d^{\\dagger})^{-3} \\exp\\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)\n$$\nNow, substitute these moments back into the simplified crossover condition:\n$$\nD_v (d^{\\dagger})^{-2} \\exp(2\\sigma^2) = D_{gb} \\delta (d^{\\dagger})^{-3} \\exp\\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)\n$$\nWe can now solve for $d^{\\dagger}$:\n$$\nd^{\\dagger} = \\frac{D_{gb} \\delta}{D_v} \\frac{\\exp\\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)}{\\exp(2\\sigma^2)} = \\frac{D_{gb} \\delta}{D_v} \\exp\\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\sigma^2 - 2\\sigma^2\\right)\n$$\n$$\nd^{\\dagger} = \\frac{D_{gb} \\delta}{D_v} \\exp\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)\n$$\nFinally, we substitute the given Arrhenius expressions for the diffusion coefficients, $D_{v}(T) = D_{v0} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{Q_{v}}{k_{B} T} \\right)$ and $D_{gb}(T) = D_{gb0} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{Q_{gb}}{k_{B} T} \\right)$:\n$$\nd^{\\dagger} = \\frac{D_{gb0} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{Q_{gb}}{k_{B} T} \\right) \\delta}{D_{v0} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{Q_{v}}{k_{B} T} \\right)} \\exp\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)\n$$\nCombining the exponential terms yields the final expression for the crossover median grain size:\n$$\nd^{\\dagger} = \\frac{D_{gb0} \\delta}{D_{v0}} \\exp\\left( \\frac{Q_v - Q_{gb}}{k_B T} + \\frac{5}{2}\\sigma^2 \\right)\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for $d^{\\dagger}$ in terms of the specified parameters.",

The general form is expressed in terms of the stress tensor components $\\sigma_{ij}$ and six material parameters $F$, $G$, $H$, $L$, $M$, and $N$:\n$$ F(\\sigma_{yy}-\\sigma_{zz})^2 + G(\\sigma_{zz}-\\sigma_{xx})^2 + H(\\sigma_{xx}-\\sigma_{yy})^2 + 2L\\tau_{yz}^2 + 2M\\tau_{zx}^2 + 2N\\tau_{xy}^2 = 1 $$\nYielding occurs when this function of stress equals $1$. The material parameters $F$, $G$, and $H$ quantify the anisotropy in tensile yield strengths, while $L$, $M$, and $N$ relate to the shear yield strengths.\n\nThe problem specifies that the thin film is in a state of plane stress, with negligible through-thickness stress and shear components. This translates to the following conditions on the stress tensor components:\n$$ \\sigma_{zz} = 0, \\quad \\tau_{xy} = 0, \\quad \\tau_{yz} = 0, \\quad \\tau_{zx} = 0 $$\nThe problem is concerned only with the in-plane stress components $\\sigma_{xx}$ and $\\sigma_{yy}$. We substitute these conditions into the general yield function. This simplification eliminates the terms involving the parameters $L$, $M$, and $N$, so their values are not required. The plane-stress specialization of the yield function is:\n$$ F(\\sigma_{yy}-0)^2 + G(0-\\sigma_{xx})^2 + H(\\sigma_{xx}-\\sigma_{yy})^2 + 2L(0)^2 + 2M(0)^2 + 2N(0)^2 = 1 $$\n$$ F\\sigma_{yy}^2 + G\\sigma_{xx}^2 + H(\\sigma_{xx}^2 - 2\\sigma_{xx}\\sigma_{yy} + \\sigma_{yy}^2) = 1 $$\nCollecting terms for $\\sigma_{xx}^2$, $\\sigma_{yy}^2$, and $\\sigma_{xx}\\sigma_{yy}$, we arrive at the specific quadratic orthotropic yield function for this plane-stress case:\n$$ (G+H)\\sigma_{xx}^2 + (F+H)\\sigma_{yy}^2 - 2H\\sigma_{xx}\\sigma_{yy} = 1 $$\nThis is the derived plane-stress specialization of the yield function. The coefficients of this quadratic form are determined by the given material parameters $F$, $G$, and $H$. For the function to represent a convex yield surface (an ellipse in the $\\sigma_{xx}$-$\\sigma_{yy}$ plane), the parameters must satisfy $4(G+H)(F+H) - (-2H)^2 > 0$, which simplifies to $4(FG+FH+GH) > 0$. Since the given values for $F$, $G$, and $H$ are positive, this condition is satisfied.\n\nNext, we obtain a closed-form expression for the yield condition under a prescribed biaxial stress ratio $r = \\sigma_{xx}/\\sigma_{yy}$. We substitute $\\sigma_{xx} = r\\sigma_{yy}$ into the plane-stress yield function:\n$$ (G+H)(r\\sigma_{yy})^2 + (F+H)\\sigma_{yy}^2 - 2H(r\\sigma_{yy})\\sigma_{yy} = 1 $$\nFactoring out $\\sigma_{yy}^2$:\n$$ \\sigma_{yy}^2 \\left[ (G+H)r^2 + (F+H) - 2Hr \\right] = 1 $$\nRearranging the terms within the bracket into a standard quadratic form in $r$:\n$$ \\sigma_{yy}^2 \\left[ (G+H)r^2 - 2Hr + (F+H) \\right] = 1 $$\nSolving for $\\sigma_{yy}$, we obtain the magnitude of the yield stress in the $y$-direction as a function of the stress ratio $r$:\n$$ \\sigma_{yy} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(G+H)r^2 - 2Hr + (F+H)}} $$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the biaxial yield condition. The positive root is taken, representing the magnitude of the stress.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $\\sigma_{yy}$ at yield for the two specified cases using the given material parameters:\n$F = 2.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{MPa}^{-2}$\n$G = 1.6 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{MPa}^{-2}$\n$H = 1.2 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{MPa}^{-2}$\n\nFirst, we pre-calculate the combined coefficients:\n$G+H = (1.6 + 1.2) \\times 10^{-5} = 2.8 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{MPa}^{-2}$\n$F+H = (2.0 + 1.2) \\times 10^{-5} = 3.2 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{MPa}^{-2}$\n$2H = 2 \\times (1.2 \\times 10^{-5}) = 2.4 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{MPa}^{-2}$\n\nCase 1: Biaxial loading with stress ratio $r = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$.\nSubstitute $r=0.5$ and the coefficient values into the expression for $\\sigma_{yy}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{yy} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(2.8 \\times 10^{-5})(0.5)^2 - (2.4 \\times 10^{-5})(0.5) + (3.2 \\times 10^{-5})}} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{yy} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10^{-5} \\left[ 2.8(0.25) - 2.4(0.5) + 3.2 \\right]}} \\, \\text{MPa} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{yy} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10^{-5} \\left[ 0.7 - 1.2 + 3.2 \\right]}} \\, \\text{MPa} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{yy} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2.7 \\times 10^{-5}}} \\, \\text{MPa} \\approx 192.4500... \\, \\text{MPa} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the yield stress is $\\sigma_{yy} = 192.5 \\, \\text{MPa}$.\n\nCase 2: Biaxial loading with stress ratio $r = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5$.\nSubstitute $r=1.5$ and the coefficient values into the expression for $\\sigma_{yy}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{yy} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(2.8 \\times 10^{-5})(1.5)^2 - (2.4 \\times 10^{-5})(1.5) + (3.2 \\times 10^{-5})}} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{yy} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10^{-5} \\left[ 2.8(2.25) - 2.4(1.5) + 3.2 \\right]}} \\, \\text{MPa} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{yy} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10^{-5} \\left[ 6.3 - 3.6 + 3.2 \\right]}} \\, \\text{MPa} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{yy} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5.9 \\times 10^{-5}}} \\, \\text{MPa} \\approx 130.1888... \\, \\text{MPa} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the yield stress is $\\sigma_{yy} = 130.2 \\, \\text{MPa}$.\n\nThe computed values for $\\sigma_{yy}$ at the onset of yield are $192.5 \\, \\text{MPa}$ for $r = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $130.2 \\, \\text{MPa}$ for $r = \\frac{3}{2}$.",
