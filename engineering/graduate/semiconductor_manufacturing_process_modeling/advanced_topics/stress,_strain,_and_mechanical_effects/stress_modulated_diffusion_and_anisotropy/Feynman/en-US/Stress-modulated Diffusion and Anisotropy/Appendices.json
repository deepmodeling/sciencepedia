            "solution": "The problem asks for the ratio of the diffusion coefficient of a substitutional dopant in silicon under hydrostatic stress to the diffusion coefficient at zero stress. We are instructed to use Transition State Theory (TST) and a linear coupling model between stress and the activation energy.\n\nAccording to TST, the rate of a thermally activated process, such as atomic diffusion, is described by an Arrhenius relationship. The diffusion coefficient, $D$, is given by:\n$$D = D_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $D_0$ is the pre-exponential factor, which is assumed to be independent of stress, $E_a$ is the activation energy for the diffusion process, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe problem states that a uniform hydrostatic stress, $\\sigma_h$, modifies the activation barrier. This interaction is described by the activation volume, $V^*$. The activation volume represents the change in volume of the system when it moves from its initial state to the transition state (saddle point) of the diffusion path. The work done by the hydrostatic stress on the system during this change in volume modifies the activation energy. The change in the Gibbs free energy of activation, $\\Delta G_a$, due to a pressure $P$ is given by $\\Delta G_a = P V^*$. For a hydrostatic stress $\\sigma_h$, the pressure is $P = -\\sigma_h$. Assuming the change in activation entropy is negligible, the change in activation energy, $\\Delta E_a$, can be written as:\n$$\\Delta E_a = -\\sigma_h V^*$$\nTherefore, the activation energy under stress, $E_a(\\sigma_h)$, can be expressed as a linear function of the zero-stress activation energy, $E_a(0)$, and the stress term:\n$$E_a(\\sigma_h) = E_a(0) - \\sigma_h V^*$$\nThe problem specifies the zero-stress activation energy as $E_a = 3.5\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, so we identify $E_a(0) = E_a$.\n\nNow we can write the expressions for the diffusion coefficient at zero stress and under stress $\\sigma_h$.\nAt zero stress ($\\sigma_h = 0$):\n$$D(0) = D_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a(0)}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nUnder a hydrostatic stress $\\sigma_h$:\n$$D(\\sigma_h) = D_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a(\\sigma_h)}{k_B T}\\right) = D_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a(0) - \\sigma_h V^*}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nWe are asked to find the ratio $\\frac{D(\\sigma_h)}{D(0)}$. Using the expressions above:\n$$\\frac{D(\\sigma_h)}{D(0)} = \\frac{D_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a(0) - \\sigma_h V^*}{k_B T}\\right)}{D_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a(0)}{k_B T}\\right)}$$\nThe pre-exponential factor $D_0$ cancels out. We can combine the exponential terms:\n$$\\frac{D(\\sigma_h)}{D(0)} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a(0) - \\sigma_h V^*}{k_B T} - \\left(-\\frac{E_a(0)}{k_B T}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{D(\\sigma_h)}{D(0)} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{-E_a(0) + \\sigma_h V^* + E_a(0)}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThis simplifies to the final derived expression for the ratio:\n$$\\frac{D(\\sigma_h)}{D(0)} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_h V^*}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThis expression shows that the ratio depends on the hydrostatic stress, activation volume, and temperature, but not on the zero-stress activation energy $E_a(0)$, which cancels out.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression numerically using the given data.
