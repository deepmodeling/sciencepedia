            "problem": "In a semiconductor front-end thermal cycle, consider a narrow, homogeneous, isotropic, linear thermoelastic interconnect line modeled as a one-dimensional rod of length $L$, cross-section $A$, and material properties Young’s modulus $E$ and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) $\\alpha$. The rod is rigidly anchored at both ends by lithographically defined pads, so that the axial displacement at the ends is zero. During a uniform furnace ramp, the rod experiences a spatially uniform temperature change $\\Delta T$ relative to a stress-free reference temperature.

It is based on fundamental principles of continuum mechanics (equilibrium, kinematics, constitutive relations) and is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. The governing equations, material properties, geometry, and boundary conditions are all specified, which is sufficient to determine a unique solution for the stress field.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, standard terminology from engineering and physics. There is no subjective or ambiguous language.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained and provides all necessary information. The conditions are consistent and do not lead to contradictions.\n- **Realism**: The model represents a standard idealization used in analyzing thermo-mechanical stress in semiconductor interconnects. The assumptions (e.g., linear elasticity, perfect clamping) are common and form a valid basis for a first-order analysis.\n- **Structure and Triviality**: The problem is well-structured and requires a systematic application of fundamental principles. While standard, it is not trivial and serves as a valid assessment of understanding in thermo-mechanics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe derivation proceeds by combining the three fundamental pillars of solid mechanics: equilibrium, kinematics, and constitutive law, subject to the specified boundary conditions.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium**: The one-dimensional equilibrium equation for a body with an axial force $N(x)$ and a distributed axial body force $b(x)$ is $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}N}{\\mathrm{d}x} + b(x) = 0$. The problem states that axial body forces are negligible, so $b(x)=0$. The equilibrium equation simplifies to $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}N}{\\mathrm{d}x} = 0$. This implies that the internal axial force $N$ is constant along the length of the rod. Since the axial stress $\\sigma(x)$ is defined as $\\sigma(x) = \\frac{N(x)}{A}$ and the cross-sectional area $A$ is uniform, the stress $\\sigma(x)$ must also be constant. Let this constant stress be denoted by $\\sigma_0$.\n    $$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\sigma}{\\mathrm{d}x} = 0 \\implies \\sigma(x) = \\sigma_0 $$\n\n2.  **Constitutive Law**: For a linear thermoelastic material, the total axial strain $\\varepsilon(x)$ is the sum of the mechanical strain $\\varepsilon_{\\text{mech}}(x)$ due to stress and the thermal strain $\\varepsilon_{\\text{th}}(x)$ due to the temperature change.\n    $$ \\varepsilon(x) = \\varepsilon_{\\text{mech}}(x) + \\varepsilon_{\\text{th}}(x) $$\n    The mechanical strain is given by Hooke's Law: $\\varepsilon_{\\text{mech}}(x) = \\frac{\\sigma(x)}{E}$. The thermal strain for a uniform temperature change $\\Delta T$ is given by $\\varepsilon_{\\text{th}}(x) = \\alpha \\Delta T$. The sign convention implies that a positive $\\Delta T$ (heating) leads to positive (extensional) strain.\n    Combining these, the constitutive relation is:\n    $$ \\varepsilon(x) = \\frac{\\sigma(x)}{E} + \\alpha \\Delta T $$\n\n3.  **Kinematics**: The axial strain $\\varepsilon(x)$ is related to the axial displacement field $u(x)$ by the strain-displacement relation for small strains:\n    $$ \\varepsilon(x) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}x} $$\n\nCombining these three relations, we can derive an expression for the displacement. Substituting the equilibrium result ($\\sigma(x) = \\sigma_0$) and the constitutive law into the kinematic relation:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}x} = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{E} + \\alpha \\Delta T $$\nSince the right-hand side is constant with respect to $x$, we can integrate this differential equation to find the displacement field $u(x)$:\n$$ \\int_0^x \\mathrm{d}u = \\int_0^x \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_0}{E} + \\alpha \\Delta T\\right) \\mathrm{d}x' $$\n$$ u(x) - u(0) = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_0}{E} + \\alpha \\Delta T\\right) x $$\n\n4.  **Applying Boundary Conditions**: The problem states that the rod is rigidly anchored at both ends, which are located at $x=0$ and $x=L$. This translates to the boundary conditions $u(0)=0$ and $u(L)=0$.\n    Applying the first boundary condition, $u(0)=0$, to the integrated displacement equation:\n    $$ u(x) - 0 = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_0}{E} + \\alpha \\Delta T\\right) x \\implies u(x) = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_0}{E} + \\alpha \\Delta T\\right) x $$\n    Now, we apply the second boundary condition, $u(L)=0$:\n    $$ u(L) = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_0}{E} + \\alpha \\Delta T\\right) L = 0 $$\n    Since the length of the rod $L$ is non-zero, the term in the parentheses must be zero for the equation to hold:\n    $$ \\frac{\\sigma_0}{E} + \\alpha \\Delta T = 0 $$\n\n5.  **Solving for Stress**: We can now solve this algebraic equation for the unknown constant stress $\\sigma_0$:\n    $$ \\frac{\\sigma_0}{E} = - \\alpha \\Delta T $$\n    $$ \\sigma_0 = -E \\alpha \\Delta T $$\n    Since we established from equilibrium that the stress $\\sigma(x)$ is constant and equal to $\\sigma_0$, the final expression for the axial Cauchy stress throughout the rod is:\n    $$ \\sigma(x) = -E \\alpha \\Delta T $$\nThis result indicates that the stress is uniform along the rod and is compressive (negative $\\sigma$) for heating ($\\Delta T > 0$) and tensile (positive $\\sigma$) for cooling ($\\Delta T < 0$). The stress is independent of the rod's length $L$ and cross-sectional area $A$, as the total thermal expansion that would have occurred ($ \\alpha \\Delta T L $) is perfectly counteracted by an equal and opposite mechanical compression.",

The solution is based on an energy balance criterion derived from the principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM).\n\nThe fundamental condition for delamination initiation is that the strain energy release rate, $G$, must reach the critical value for the interface, known as the interfacial toughness, $G_c$.\n$$G \\ge G_c$$\nDelamination initiates at the point of equality, where the driving force for crack propagation exactly balances the material's resistance.\n$$G = G_c$$\nThe problem states that upon delamination, the film fully relaxes its in-plane stress and that bending energy is negligible.

The relationship between the equi-biaxial in-plane stress $\\sigma_f$ and the in-plane elastic strain $\\epsilon_f^{elastic}$ is:\n$$\\epsilon_f^{elastic} = \\frac{1}{E_f}(\\sigma_f - \\nu_f \\sigma_f) = \\frac{\\sigma_f}{E_f}(1 - \\nu_f)$$\nwhere $E_f$ is the Young's modulus and $\\nu_f$ is the Poisson's ratio of the film.\nSolving for the stress $\\sigma_f$:\n$$\\sigma_f = \\frac{E_f}{1 - \\nu_f} \\epsilon_f^{elastic} = \\frac{E_f}{1 - \\nu_f}(\\alpha_f - \\alpha_s)\\Delta T$$\nThe term $\\frac{E_f}{1 - \\nu_f}$ is known as the biaxial modulus, $M_f$.\n\nWe can now express the strain energy density $U$ in terms of the temperature drop $\\Delta T$:\n$$U = \\sigma_f \\epsilon_f^{elastic} = \\left(\\frac{E_f}{1 - \\nu_f}\\epsilon_f^{elastic}\\right)\\epsilon_f^{elastic} = \\frac{E_f}{1 - \\nu_f}(\\epsilon_f^{elastic})^2$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\epsilon_f^{elastic}$:\n$$U = \\frac{E_f}{1 - \\nu_f} \\left((\\alpha_f - \\alpha_s)\\Delta T\\right)^2 = \\frac{E_f}{1 - \\nu_f} (\\alpha_s - \\alpha_f)^2 (\\Delta T)^2$$\nThe strain energy release rate is then:\n$$G = h_f U = h_f \\frac{E_f}{1 - \\nu_f} (\\alpha_s - \\alpha_f)^2 (\\Delta T)^2$$\nAt the onset of delamination, $G = G_c$ and $\\Delta T = \\Delta T_c$:\n$$G_c = h_f \\frac{E_f}{1 - \\nu_f} (\\alpha_s - \\alpha_f)^2 (\\Delta T_c)^2$$\nWe now solve for the critical temperature drop $\\Delta T_c$:\n$$(\\Delta T_c)^2 = \\frac{G_c (1 - \\nu_f)}{h_f E_f (\\alpha_s - \\alpha_f)^2}$$\n$$\\Delta T_c = \\sqrt{\\frac{G_c (1 - \\nu_f)}{h_f E_f (\\alpha_s - \\alpha_f)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha_s - \\alpha_f} \\sqrt{\\frac{G_c (1 - \\nu_f)}{h_f E_f}}$$\nWe take the positive root as $\\Delta T_c$ represents a magnitude.\n\nFinally, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$G_c = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-2}}$\n$h_f = 5.00 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$E_f = 2.50 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n$\\nu_f = 0.23$\n$\\alpha_f = 3.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}}$\n$\\alpha_s = 17.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}}$\n\nFirst, we compute the intermediate terms:\n$$1 - \\nu_f = 1 - 0.23 = 0.77$$\n$$\\alpha_s - \\alpha_f = (17.0 \\times 10^{-6} - 3.0 \\times 10^{-6})\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}} = 14.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}}$$\n$$h_f E_f = (5.00 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m})(2.50 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}) = 1.25 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{N\\,m^{-1}} = 1.25 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-2}}$$\nNow we evaluate the expression for $\\Delta T_c$:\n$$\\Delta T_c = \\frac{1}{14.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{(5.0\\,\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-2}})(0.77)}{1.25 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-2}}}}$$\n$$\\Delta T_c = \\frac{1}{14.0 \\times 10^{-6}} \\sqrt{\\frac{3.85}{1.25 \\times 10^5}}\\,\\mathrm{K}$$\n$$\\Delta T_c = \\frac{1}{14.0 \\times 10^{-6}} \\sqrt{3.08 \\times 10^{-5}}\\,\\mathrm{K}$$\n$$\\Delta T_c = \\frac{1}{14.0 \\times 10^{-6}} (0.00554977...)\\,\\mathrm{K}$$\n$$\\Delta T_c \\approx 396.41248...\\,\\mathrm{K}$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, as requested:\n$$\\Delta T_c \\approx 396\\,\\mathrm{K}$$",
