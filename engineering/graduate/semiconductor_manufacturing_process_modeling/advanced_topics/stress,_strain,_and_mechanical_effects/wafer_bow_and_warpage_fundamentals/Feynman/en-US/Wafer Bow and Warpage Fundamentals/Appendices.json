            "problem": "A circular, isotropic silicon substrate of thickness $h_s$ carries a uniformly stressed, much thinner, isotropic film of thickness $h_f$ deposited on its top surface. The film has a uniform equi-biaxial residual stress $\\sigma_f$ (positive in tension). Assume small deflections, linear elasticity, and that $h_f \\ll h_s$ so that the neutral axis of bending remains effectively at the substrate mid-plane and the film’s contribution to the bending stiffness is negligible.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the relationship between film stress and wafer curvature, known as the Stoney equation, under specific simplifying assumptions.\n\n**Derivation**\n\n1.  **Bending Moment from Film Stress**: A thin film of thickness $h_f$ with a uniform biaxial stress $\\sigma_f$ is deposited on a substrate of thickness $h_s$. The stress in the film generates a force per unit length, $F'$, acting at the interface. This force is given by:\n    $$F' = \\sigma_f h_f$$\n    Due to the assumption that $h_f \\ll h_s$, the neutral axis of bending for the film-substrate composite is assumed to be at the mid-plane of the substrate. The film force $F'$ acts at the top surface of the substrate, which is at a distance of approximately $h_s/2$ from the neutral axis. This force creates a bending moment per unit length, $M'$, given by:\n    $$M' = F' \\left(\\frac{h_s}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\sigma_f h_f h_s}{2}$$\n    This moment is equi-biaxial, meaning it acts equally along any two orthogonal directions in the plane of the wafer.\n\n2.  **Moment-Curvature Relationship from Plate Theory**: According to classical plate theory for an isotropic material, the relationship between the applied bending moments per unit length ($M_x$, $M_y$) and the curvatures ($\\kappa_x$, $\\kappa_y$) is:\n    $$M_x = D (\\kappa_x + \\nu_s \\kappa_y)$$\n    $$M_y = D (\\kappa_y + \\nu_s \\kappa_x)$$\n    where $D$ is the flexural rigidity of the plate. For a plate of thickness $h_s$ with Young's modulus $E_s$ and Poisson's ratio $\\nu_s$, the flexural rigidity is:\n    $$D = \\frac{E_s h_s^3}{12(1-\\nu_s^2)}$$\n    The problem states the curvature is equi-biaxial, so $\\kappa_x = \\kappa_y = \\kappa$. Consequently, the bending moment must also be equi-biaxial, $M_x = M_y = M'$. Substituting this into the plate bending equation:\n    $$M' = D (\\kappa + \\nu_s \\kappa) = D \\kappa (1+\\nu_s)$$\n    Now, substitute the expression for $D$:\n    $$M' = \\frac{E_s h_s^3}{12(1-\\nu_s^2)} \\kappa (1+\\nu_s) = \\frac{E_s h_s^3}{12(1-\\nu_s)(1+\\nu_s)} \\kappa (1+\\nu_s)$$\n    $$M' = \\frac{E_s h_s^3}{12(1-\\nu_s)} \\kappa$$\n    This equation relates the internal bending moment in the substrate to its curvature. The quantity $\\frac{E_s}{1-\\nu_s}$ is often referred to as the biaxial modulus of the substrate, $M_s$.\n\n3.  **Equating Moments**: The external moment generated by the film stress must be balanced by the internal restoring moment of the bent substrate. Therefore, we equate the two expressions for $M'$:\n    $$\\frac{\\sigma_f h_f h_s}{2} = \\frac{E_s h_s^3}{12(1-\\nu_s)} \\kappa$$\n    Solving for the curvature $\\kappa$:\n    $$\\kappa = \\frac{\\sigma_f h_f h_s}{2} \\cdot \\frac{12(1-\\nu_s)}{E_s h_s^3}$$\n    $$\\kappa = \\frac{6 \\sigma_f h_f (1-\\nu_s)}{E_s h_s^2}$$\n    This is the celebrated Stoney equation, which relates the wafer curvature to the film stress and the properties of the film and substrate.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\n\nThe given values must be converted to base SI units (meters, Pascals).\n-   $E_s = 130\\ \\text{GPa} = 130 \\times 10^9\\ \\text{Pa}$\n-   $\\nu_s = 0.28$\n-   $h_s = 775\\ \\mu\\text{m} = 775 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{m}$\n-   $\\sigma_f = 300\\ \\text{MPa} = 300 \\times 10^6\\ \\text{Pa}$\n-   $h_f = 1\\ \\mu\\text{m} = 1 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{m}$\n\nSubstitute these values into the derived formula for $\\kappa$:\n$$\\kappa = \\frac{6 (300 \\times 10^6) (1 \\times 10^{-6}) (1 - 0.28)}{(130 \\times 10^9) (775 \\times 10^{-6})^2}$$\n$$\\kappa = \\frac{6 \\times 300 \\times 10^6 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 0.72}{130 \\times 10^9 \\times (775^2 \\times 10^{-12})}$$\n$$\\kappa = \\frac{1800 \\times 0.72}{130 \\times 10^9 \\times 600625 \\times 10^{-12}} = \\frac{1296}{130 \\times 600625 \\times 10^{-3}}$$\n$$\\kappa = \\frac{1296}{78081.25} \\approx 0.0165979\\ \\text{m}^{-1}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the curvature is:\n$$\\kappa \\approx 0.01660\\ \\text{m}^{-1}$$\n\nThe radius of curvature, $R$, is the reciprocal of the curvature $\\kappa$:\n$$R = \\frac{1}{\\kappa} = \\frac{1}{0.0165979\\ \\text{m}^{-1}} \\approx 60.2485\\ \\text{m}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the radius of curvature is:\n$$R \\approx 60.25\\ \\text{m}$$\n\n**Comment on the Sign of $\\kappa$**\n\nThe derived relationship is $\\kappa = \\frac{6(1-\\nu_s)}{E_s} \\frac{\\sigma_f h_f}{h_s^2}$. In this expression, the material properties ($E_s$, $\\nu_s$) and geometric dimensions ($h_s$, $h_f$) are all positive quantities. Specifically, $0 < \\nu_s < 0.5$ for most engineering materials, so $(1-\\nu_s)$ is positive. Therefore, the sign of the curvature $\\kappa$ is directly determined by the sign of the film stress $\\sigma_f$.\n\n-   **Tensile Film Stress ($\\sigma_f > 0$)**: If the film stress is tensile, then $\\kappa > 0$. According to the problem's sign convention, this corresponds to the wafer bending such that the film side is concave. This is physically intuitive: a tensile film tries to contract, pulling the edges of the substrate upwards.\n-   **Compressive Film Stress ($\\sigma_f < 0$)**: If the film stress is compressive, then $\\kappa < 0$. This corresponds to the wafer bending such that the film side is convex (i.e., the center of the wafer bulges upwards). This is also intuitive: a compressive film tries to expand, pushing the substrate into a dome shape.",

Second, the resulting curvature of the silicon wafer ($\\kappa$) will be determined using the Stoney equation, paying careful attention to the sign conventions specified.\n\n**Part 1: Film Stress ($\\sigma_{f}$)**\n\nThe film is assumed to be in a state of equi-biaxial plane stress, meaning the in-plane stress components are equal, $\\sigma_{xx} = \\sigma_{yy} = \\sigma_{f}$, and the out-of-plane stress is zero, $\\sigma_{zz} = 0$.

This is the \"Stoney limit,\" where the thick substrate acts as a rigid constraint, dictating the total strain of the composite structure. Therefore, the total strain in the film is forced to be equal to the free thermal strain of the substrate, $\\epsilon_{\\text{th},s} = \\alpha_s \\Delta T$.\n$$ \\epsilon_{\\text{total}} = \\epsilon_{\\text{th},s} = \\alpha_s \\Delta T $$\nEquating the two expressions for the total strain allows us to solve for the mechanical strain in the film:\n$$ \\alpha_s \\Delta T = \\epsilon_{\\text{mech}} + \\alpha_f \\Delta T $$\n$$ \\epsilon_{\\text{mech}} = (\\alpha_s - \\alpha_f) \\Delta T = -(\\alpha_f - \\alpha_s) \\Delta T = -\\Delta \\alpha \\Delta T $$\nFinally, we substitute this expression for the mechanical strain back into the stress-strain relationship to obtain the formula for the equi-biaxial thermal stress in the film:\n$$ \\sigma_f = M_f \\epsilon_{\\text{mech}} = \\frac{E_f}{1-\\nu_f} (-\\Delta \\alpha \\Delta T) $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value of the stress using the given parameters:\n- $E_{f} = 110\\ \\text{GPa} = 110 \\times 10^9\\ \\text{Pa}$\n- $\\nu_{f} = 0.34$\n- $\\Delta \\alpha = 16 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{K}^{-1}$\n- $\\Delta T = 200\\ \\text{K}$\n\n$$ \\sigma_f = \\frac{110 \\times 10^9\\ \\text{Pa}}{1 - 0.34} \\times (-(16 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{K}^{-1}) \\times 200\\ \\text{K}) $$\n$$ \\sigma_f = \\frac{110 \\times 10^9}{0.66} \\times (-3200 \\times 10^{-6})\\ \\text{Pa} $$\n$$ \\sigma_f = (1.66\\overline{6} \\times 10^{11}) \\times (-3.2 \\times 10^{-3})\\ \\text{Pa} $$\n$$ \\sigma_f = -5.33\\overline{3} \\times 10^8\\ \\text{Pa} = -533.\\overline{3}\\ \\text{MPa} $$\nThe negative sign indicates that the stress is compressive.

Rounding to four significant figures, the film stress is $\\sigma_f = -533.3\\ \\text{MPa}$.\n\n**Part 2: Wafer Curvature ($\\kappa$)**\n\nThe stress in the thin film induces a bending moment in the substrate, causing it to curve. For a thin film on a thick substrate, this relationship is described by the Stoney equation. The force per unit width in the film is $F' = \\sigma_f h_f$. This force creates a bending moment per unit width, $M'$, which is balanced by the restoring moment of the bent substrate. The classic Stoney equation relates curvature to film stress:\n$$ \\kappa = \\frac{6 \\sigma_f h_f (1-\\nu_s)}{E_s h_s^2} $$\nIt is critical to be precise about the sign convention. The problem states that \"curvature $\\kappa$ is defined as positive if the wafer center deflects away from the film side (the film side is convex)\".\nA compressive stress in the film ($\\sigma_f < 0$) will cause it to expand relative to the substrate, forcing the structure to bend such that the film is on the outer, convex side. According to the problem's definition, this corresponds to a positive curvature ($\\kappa > 0$).\nConversely, a tensile stress ($\\sigma_f > 0$) would cause the film to contract, bending the wafer so the film is on the inner, concave side, corresponding to a negative curvature ($\\kappa < 0$).\nTherefore, the curvature $\\kappa$ and the film stress $\\sigma_f$ must have opposite signs. The standard formula as written above implies they have the same sign. To align with the problem's explicit sign convention, we must introduce a negative sign:\n$$ \\kappa = - \\frac{6 \\sigma_f h_f (1-\\nu_s)}{E_s h_s^2} $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value of the curvature using the result for $\\sigma_f$ and the given substrate properties:\n- $\\sigma_f = -5.33\\overline{3} \\times 10^8\\ \\text{Pa}$\n- $h_{f} = 1.0\\ \\mu\\text{m} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{m}$\n- $E_{s} = 130\\ \\text{GPa} = 130 \\times 10^9\\ \\text{Pa}$\n- $\\nu_{s} = 0.28$\n- $h_{s} = 775\\ \\mu\\text{m} = 775 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{m}$\n\n$$ \\kappa = - \\frac{6 \\times (-5.33\\overline{3} \\times 10^8\\ \\text{Pa}) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{m}) \\times (1 - 0.28)}{(130 \\times 10^9\\ \\text{Pa}) \\times (775 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{m})^2} $$\n$$ \\kappa = \\frac{6 \\times (5.33\\overline{3} \\times 10^8) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times 0.72}{130 \\times 10^9 \\times (775^2 \\times 10^{-12})}\\ \\text{m}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\kappa = \\frac{2304}{130 \\times 10^9 \\times 600625 \\times 10^{-12}}\\ \\text{m}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\kappa = \\frac{2304}{78081.25}\\ \\text{m}^{-1} \\approx 0.029505\\ \\text{m}^{-1} $$\nAs expected, the compressive stress leads to a positive curvature.

For process modeling, engineers often detrend $w(x,y)$ by subtracting a best-fit rigid plane or a best-fit sphere to define bow and warp metrics. Let the measured surface be well-approximated by the quadratic form\n$$\nw(x,y) = w_0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\big(k_x x^2 + k_y y^2\\big),\n$$\nwhere $w_0$ is an unknown constant offset and $k_x, k_y$ are effective principal curvatures along orthogonal in-plane axes, arising from stress distributions that are sufficiently uniform over the wafer.\n\nDefine the bow metric $B$ as the residual displacement at the wafer center after detrending, i.e., after subtracting the chosen reference surface, and the warp metric $W$ as the peak-to-valley residual across the wafer after detrending (the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the residual over $x^2 + y^2 \\le R^2$).

Spherical detrending leaves the bow unchanged and typically increases the warp by a factor of $2$ relative to planar detrending, because subtracting a sphere adds curvature to the residual.\n\nC. Spherical detrending is most appropriate for anticlastic (saddle) shapes with negative Gaussian curvature $k_x k_y < 0$, since a sphere well-approximates the local surface in that case.\n\nD. When the wafer bending is dominated by uniform biaxial stress or nearly axisymmetric thermal fields such that $k_x \\approx k_y$ and $k_x k_y > 0$, spherical detrending removes the global mean curvature, driving the reported bow toward $0$ and making the warp reflect anisotropy and nonuniformities rather than global spherical bending. Under these conditions, spherical detrending provides more physically interpretable metrics for process-model linkage.\n\nE.

This isolates higher-order or non-uniform effects, which is physically more meaningful for process control. This statement is **correct**.\n- **E:** This statement incorrectly invokes the breakdown of small-slope theory. The entire problem is framed within this theory ($h \\ll R_c$), and the statement contradicts this premise. **Incorrect**.\n\nTherefore, statements A and D are correct.",
