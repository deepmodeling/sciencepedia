            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the effective valence for electromigration, $Z^{*}$, from fundamental principles and a given set of experimental data. The derivation starts from the generalized Nernst-Planck equation for atomic flux, which is then simplified based on the conditions specified in the problem.\n\nThe net atomic flux, denoted by $J_{a}$, in a crystalline solid is driven by the gradient of the chemical potential, $\\mu$. The flux is related to the chemical potential gradient by:\n$$J_{a} = -C M \\nabla \\mu$$\nwhere $C$ is the concentration of mobile atoms and $M$ is their mobility. The mobility $M$ is related to the atomic diffusivity $D$ through the Nernst-Einstein relation:\n$$M = \\frac{D}{k_{B} T}$$\nwhere $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. Substituting this into the flux equation gives:\n$$J_{a} = -\\frac{D C}{k_{B} T} \\nabla \\mu$$\nThe chemical potential gradient $\\nabla \\mu$ incorporates all driving forces acting on the atoms. For a metal interconnect, the primary driving forces are due to the electric field (electromigration), mechanical stress gradients (stress migration), and temperature gradients (thermomigration). The gradient of the chemical potential can be written as:\n$$\\nabla \\mu = -Z^{*} e \\mathbf{E} - \\Omega \\nabla \\sigma - S^{*} \\nabla T + k_B T \\frac{\\nabla C}{C}$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field, $Z^{*}e$ is the effective charge of the migrating ion ($e$ is the elementary charge), $\\Omega$ is the atomic volume, $\\sigma$ is the hydrostatic stress, $S^{*}$ is the heat of transport, and the last term accounts for Fickian diffusion down a concentration gradient.\n\nThe problem statement provides conditions that allow for a significant simplification of this general expression.\n1.  **Isothermal Environment**: The experiment is conducted at a constant temperature $T = 400\\,\\mathrm{K}$. This implies the temperature gradient is zero, $\\nabla T = 0$. Consequently, the thermomigration driving force, $-S^{*} \\nabla T$, is null.\n2.  **Steady Drift Velocity in a Straight Line**: The problem specifies a \"steady drift velocity\" is measured in a \"straight ... interconnect segment\". In such a one-dimensional, uniform line under DC current, it is a standard and necessary assumption for this type of analysis that the electromigration force is the dominant driving force for the observed net atomic transport. This implies that gradients in stress, $\\nabla \\sigma$, and atomic concentration, $\\nabla C$, along the line are negligible compared to the electromigration term. Without this assumption, the problem would be underspecified.\n\nWith these justified simplifications, the chemical potential gradient reduces to the electromigration term only:\n$$\\nabla \\mu \\approx -Z^{*} e \\mathbf{E}$$\nSubstituting this simplified gradient into the flux equation yields the flux due to electromigration alone:\n$$J_{a} = -\\frac{D C}{k_{B} T} (-Z^{*} e \\mathbf{E}) = \\frac{D C Z^{*} e \\mathbf{E}}{k_{B} T}$$\nThe problem defines the drift velocity $v$ of the marker atoms, which are assumed to follow the net atomic flux, as $v = J_{a}/C$. Substituting the expression for $J_{a}$:\n$$v = \\frac{1}{C} \\left( \\frac{D C Z^{*} e E}{k_{B} T} \\right) = \\frac{D Z^{*} e E}{k_{B} T}$$\nNote that we have transitioned to scalar quantities ($v$, $E$) as the problem is one-dimensional, with all vectors directed along the $\\hat{x}$ axis.\n\nThe electric field $E$ is related to the conventional current density $j$ by Ohm's law:\n$$E = \\rho j$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the electrical resistivity. Substituting this into the expression for velocity gives:\n$$v = \\frac{D Z^{*} e (\\rho j)}{k_{B} T}$$\nOur goal is to find $Z^{*}$. We rearrange the equation to solve for $Z^{*}$:\n$$Z^{*} = \\frac{v k_{B} T}{D e \\rho j}$$\nAll quantities on the right-hand side are given in the problem, except for the diffusivity $D$, which must be calculated from the provided Arrhenius relationship.\n\nFirst, we calculate the diffusivity $D$ at $T = 400 \\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n$$D(T) = D_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{a}}{k_{B} T}\\right)$$\nThe given parameters are $D_{0} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\mathrm{m^{2}/s}$, $E_{a} = 0.90 \\,\\mathrm{eV}$, and $k_{B} = 1.380\\,649 \\times 10^{-23} \\,\\mathrm{J/K}$. We must use consistent units, so we convert $E_{a}$ to Joules:\n$$E_{a} = 0.90 \\,\\mathrm{eV} \\times (1.602\\,176\\,634 \\times 10^{-19} \\,\\mathrm{J/eV}) = 1.441\\,958\\,97 \\times 10^{-19} \\,\\mathrm{J}$$\nNext, we calculate the thermal energy $k_{B} T$:\n$$k_{B} T = (1.380\\,649 \\times 10^{-23} \\,\\mathrm{J/K}) \\times (400 \\,\\mathrm{K}) = 5.522\\,596 \\times 10^{-21} \\,\\mathrm{J}$$\nNow, we can compute the exponent:\n$$-\\frac{E_{a}}{k_{B} T} = -\\frac{1.441\\,958\\,97 \\times 10^{-19} \\,\\mathrm{J}}{5.522\\,596 \\times 10^{-21} \\,\\mathrm{J}} \\approx -26.108$$\nAnd finally, the diffusivity $D$:\n$$D = (1.00 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\mathrm{m^{2}/s}) \\times \\exp(-26.108) = 4.586 \\times 10^{-18} \\,\\mathrm{m^{2}/s}$$\nNow we have all the necessary values to calculate $Z^{*}$:\n- $v = -1.00 \\times 10^{-11} \\,\\mathrm{m/s}$\n- $k_{B} T = 5.522\\,596 \\times 10^{-21} \\,\\mathrm{J}$\n- $D = 4.586 \\times 10^{-18} \\,\\mathrm{m^{2}/s}$\n- $e = 1.602\\,176\\,634 \\times 10^{-19} \\,\\mathrm{C}$\n- $\\rho = 2.00 \\times 10^{-8} \\,\\mathrm{\\Omega\\,m}$\n- $j = 1.00 \\times 10^{11} \\,\\mathrm{A/m^{2}}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $Z^{*}$:\n$$Z^{*} = \\frac{(-1.00 \\times 10^{-11} \\,\\mathrm{m/s}) \\times (5.522\\,596 \\times 10^{-21} \\,\\mathrm{J})}{(4.586 \\times 10^{-18} \\,\\mathrm{m^{2}/s}) \\times (1.602\\,176\\,634 \\times 10^{-19} \\,\\mathrm{C}) \\times (2.00 \\times 10^{-8} \\,\\mathrm{\\Omega\\,m}) \\times (1.00 \\times 10^{11} \\,\\mathrm{A/m^{2}})}$$\n$$Z^{*} = \\frac{-5.522\\,596 \\times 10^{-32} \\,\\mathrm{J \\cdot m/s}}{1.4695 \\times 10^{-33} \\,\\mathrm{J \\cdot m/s}} \\approx -37.581$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$Z^{*} \\approx -37.6$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the net force on the copper ions is in the direction of electron flow (i.e., opposite to the conventional current), which signifies that the electron wind force is dominant over the direct electrostatic force.

            "problem": "A two-dimensional thin-film interconnect of uniform electrical conductivity is modeled as a cross-sectional domain in which the electric potential satisfies Laplace’s equation. Consider a straight interconnect line that makes a right-angle turn, forming an inner corner with a reentrant wedge interior angle. Near the inner corner, you may approximate the conduction domain as an infinite wedge with homogeneous insulating edges, driven by a remote potential difference that causes current to flow through the bend. The objective is to derive and compute the local amplification of the current density near the inner corner due to geometric crowding, as a fundamental model relevant to Electromigration (EM) risk assessment in semiconductor manufacturing process modeling.\n\nYou must proceed from first principles as follows:\n- Model the electric potential as a solution of the Partial Differential Equation (PDE) Laplace’s equation, namely, $\\nabla^{2} V = 0$ in a wedge-shaped domain of interior angle $\\alpha$, expressed in plane polar coordinates $(r,\\theta)$ centered at the corner. The film is homogeneous with spatially uniform conductivity, so that the current density satisfies $\\mathbf{j} = \\sigma \\mathbf{E}$ with $\\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla V$ and scalar $\\sigma$.\n- Treat the interconnect edges as perfectly insulating boundaries, so there is no normal current crossing the edges. Express this as a homogeneous Neumann Boundary Condition (BC) on the wedge boundaries at $\\theta = 0$ and $\\theta = \\alpha$.\n- Use separation of variables in polar coordinates to obtain the leading-order asymptotic behavior of $|\\mathbf{E}(r,\\theta)|$ as $r \\to 0$ for a reentrant wedge with interior angle $\\alpha$. Establish the exponent governing the radial scaling of the field magnitude.\n- Define the local current-density amplification factor at radius $r$ as the dimensionless quantity $A(r) = \\dfrac{|\\mathbf{j}(r)|}{|\\mathbf{j}(R)|}$, where $R$ is a fixed reference radius chosen within the near-corner region where the wedge approximation remains valid. Show how to express $A(r)$ in terms of $\\alpha$, $r$, and $R$ only, without any dependence on the conductivity $\\sigma$ or unknown global coefficients. Include the physically motivated saturation due to a finite inner-corner rounding radius $r_{c}$ by replacing $r$ with $\\max(r, r_{c})$ in your final expression for $A(r)$.\n- The line makes a $90^\\circ$ bend, so the inner corner is a reentrant wedge with interior angle $\\alpha = \\dfrac{3\\pi}{2}$.

If $r \\le 0$, treat it as $r=0$ before applying the saturation rule via $r_{c}$.\n- Angles must be treated in radians.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. It describes a standard problem in electrostatics and potential theory, directly applicable to the modeling of current crowding in microelectronic interconnects, a key aspect of electromigration analysis. The provided data and conditions are sufficient and consistent for deriving a unique, meaningful solution. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation and computation of the current density amplification factor near a reentrant corner in a conductive thin film. The physical model is based on steady-state current flow, governed by the Laplace equation for the electric potential $V$.\n\nFirst, we establish the mathematical framework. The electric potential $V(r, \\theta)$ in the two-dimensional wedge-shaped domain is governed by Laplace's equation, which in plane polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$ is:\n$$ \\nabla^2 V = \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial r} \\right) + \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial \\theta^2} = 0 $$\nThe domain is a wedge of interior angle $\\alpha$, defined by $0 \\le \\theta \\le \\alpha$. The interconnect edges are electrically insulating, which implies that no current flows normal to these boundaries. Since the current density vector is $\\mathbf{j} = -\\sigma \\nabla V$, the condition of zero normal current translates to a zero normal derivative of the potential. This is a homogeneous Neumann boundary condition:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial n} = 0 \\quad \\text{on the boundaries} $$\nOn the boundary at $\\theta=0$, the outward normal is in the $-\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$ direction, so the condition is $\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial \\theta}|_{\\theta=0} = 0$. On the boundary at $\\theta=\\alpha$, the outward normal is in the $+\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$ direction, so the condition is $\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial \\theta}|_{\\theta=\\alpha} = 0$. In summary:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial \\theta}(r, 0) = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial \\theta}(r, \\alpha) = 0 $$\nWe solve Laplace's equation using the method of separation of variables. We seek solutions of the form $V(r, \\theta) = \\mathcal{R}(r) \\Theta(\\theta)$. Substituting this into the PDE and separating the variables leads to two ordinary differential equations, where $k$ is a separation constant:\n$$ r^2 \\mathcal{R}'' + r \\mathcal{R}' - k \\mathcal{R} = 0 $$\n$$ \\Theta'' + k \\Theta = 0 $$\nLet's set the separation constant $k = \\lambda^2$. The angular equation is $\\Theta'' + \\lambda^2 \\Theta = 0$, with the general solution $\\Theta(\\theta) = C_1 \\cos(\\lambda \\theta) + C_2 \\sin(\\lambda \\theta)$.\nApplying the boundary conditions on $\\Theta(\\theta)$:\n1. At $\\theta=0$: $\\Theta'(0) = -C_1 \\lambda \\sin(0) + C_2 \\lambda \\cos(0) = C_2 \\lambda = 0$. For a non-trivial solution, we need $\\lambda \\neq 0$ (the case $\\lambda=0$ is treated separately), so we must have $C_2 = 0$. The solution form reduces to $\\Theta(\\theta) = C_1 \\cos(\\lambda \\theta)$.\n2. At $\\theta=\\alpha$: $\\Theta'(\\alpha) = -C_1 \\lambda \\sin(\\lambda \\alpha) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution ($C_1 \\neq 0$), we require $\\sin(\\lambda \\alpha) = 0$. This quantizes the allowed values of $\\lambda$: $\\lambda \\alpha = n \\pi$ for integer $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_n = \\frac{n \\pi}{\\alpha}$, and the corresponding eigenfunctions are $\\Theta_n(\\theta) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{n \\pi \\theta}{\\alpha}\\right)$.\n\nFor $n=0$, $\\lambda_0 = 0$, the ODEs are $\\Theta_0''=0 \\implies \\Theta_0(\\theta) = A\\theta+B$ and $r^2\\mathcal{R}_0''+r\\mathcalR_0'=0 \\implies \\mathcal{R}_0(r)=C\\ln(r)+D$. Applying the BCs to $\\Theta_0(\\theta)$ gives $A=0$, so $\\Theta_0$ is a constant. The $n=0$ solution is $C_0 \\ln(r) + D_0$.\n\nThe radial equation is an Euler-Cauchy equation: $r^2 \\mathcal{R}_n'' + r \\mathcal{R}_n' - \\lambda_n^2 \\mathcal{R}_n = 0$. Its solutions are of the form $r^p$, leading to the characteristic equation $p(p-1) + p - \\lambda_n^2 = 0$, which gives $p = \\pm \\lambda_n$. The general radial solution is $\\mathcal{R}_n(r) = D_n r^{\\lambda_n} + E_n r^{-\\lambda_n}$.\n\nThe full solution for the potential is a superposition of all possible product solutions:\n$$ V(r, \\theta) = (C_0 \\ln(r) + D_0) + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} (D_n r^{n \\pi / \\alpha} + E_n r^{-n \\pi / \\alpha}) \\cos\\left(\\frac{n \\pi \\theta}{\\alpha}\\right) $$\nWe are interested in the behavior as $r \\to 0$. The $\\ln(r)$ term and all $r^{-n\\pi/\\alpha}$ terms diverge at the origin. However, the problem describes a current flowing through the bend, not originating from a source or sink at the corner. The far-field conditions (the remote potential difference) determine the coefficients. The local behavior near $r=0$ is dominated by the lowest-power non-constant term that is regular or has the weakest singularity. In this context, the series in positive powers of $r$ represents the local field behavior.\n$$ V(r, \\theta) \\approx D_0 + D_1 r^{\\pi/\\alpha} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi\\theta}{\\alpha}\\right) + \\text{higher order terms} $$\nThe constant $D_0$ does not contribute to the electric field. The leading-order term dictating the field is $V_{lead}(r, \\theta) = D_1 r^{\\pi/\\alpha} \\cos(\\frac{\\pi\\theta}{\\alpha})$.\n\nThe electric field is $\\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla V = -\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial r}\\hat{\\mathbf{r}} - \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial \\theta}\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$. For the leading term:\n$$ E_r = -\\frac{\\partial V_{lead}}{\\partial r} = -D_1 \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{\\alpha}\\right) r^{(\\pi/\\alpha) - 1} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi\\theta}{\\alpha}\\right) $$\n$$ E_\\theta = -\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial V_{lead}}{\\partial \\theta} = - \\frac{D_1 r^{\\pi/\\alpha}}{r} \\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{\\alpha}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi\\theta}{\\alpha}\\right) = D_1 \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{\\alpha}\\right) r^{(\\pi/ \\alpha) - 1} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi\\theta}{\\alpha}\\right) $$\nThe magnitude of the electric field is:\n$$ |\\mathbf{E}(r, \\theta)| = \\sqrt{E_r^2 + E_\\theta^2} = \\sqrt{\\left[D_1 \\frac{\\pi}{\\alpha} r^{(\\pi/\\alpha)-1}\\right]^2 (\\cos^2 + \\sin^2)} = \\left|D_1 \\frac{\\pi}{\\alpha}\\right| r^{(\\pi/\\alpha)-1} $$\nThe field magnitude scales as $r^p$ with the exponent $p = \\frac{\\pi}{\\alpha}-1$. For a reentrant corner, $\\alpha > \\pi$, which implies $\\frac{\\pi}{\\alpha}  1$, so the exponent $p$ is negative. This causes the field to diverge as $r \\to 0$, a phenomenon known as current crowding.\n\nThe current density is $\\mathbf{j} = \\sigma \\mathbf{E}$, so its magnitude is $|\\mathbf{j}| = \\sigma |\\mathbf{E}|$. The amplification factor $A(r)$ is defined as the ratio of an effective current density magnitude at radius $r$ to that at a reference radius $R$:\n$$ A(r) = \\frac{|\\mathbf{j}(r)|}{|\\mathbf{j}(R)|} = \\frac{\\sigma |\\mathbf{E}(r)|}{\\sigma |\\mathbf{E}(R)|} = \\frac{|\\mathbf{E}(r)|}{|\\mathbf{E}(R)|} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $|\\mathbf{E}(r)|$:\n$$ A(r) = \\frac{\\left|D_1 \\frac{\\pi}{\\alpha}\\right| r^{(\\pi/\\alpha)-1}}{\\left|D_1 \\frac{\\pi}{\\alpha}\\right| R^{(\\pi/\\alpha)-1}} = \\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right)^{(\\pi/\\alpha)-1} $$\nThis expression is independent of the unknown coefficient $D_1$ and the conductivity $\\sigma$.\n\nTo account for the physical reality that a corner is never perfectly sharp, a saturation is introduced using a finite corner rounding radius $r_c$. The radius $r$ in the formula is replaced by an effective radius $r_{eff} = \\max(r, r_c)$. The final expression for the amplification factor is:\n$$ A(r) = \\left(\\frac{\\max(r, r_c)}{R}\\right)^{(\\pi/\\alpha)-1} $$\nWe now apply the specific parameters:\n- A $90^\\circ$ bend gives a reentrant inner angle of $\\alpha = 270^\\circ = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$ radians.\n- Reference radius $R = w/2 = 1.0/2 = 0.5$ micrometers.\n- Corner rounding radius $r_c = 0.02$ micrometers.\n- Evaluation radii $r \\in \\{0.5, 0.05, 0.005, 0, 0.2\\}$ micrometers.\n\nThe exponent is $p = \\frac{\\pi}{\\alpha}-1 = \\frac{\\pi}{3\\pi/2}-1 = \\frac{2}{3}-1 = -\\frac{1}{3}$. The amplification formula becomes:\n$$ A(r) = \\left(\\frac{\\max(r, 0.02)}{0.5}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{0.5}{\\max(r, 0.02)}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\nThe problem states that if $r \\le 0$, it should be treated as $r=0$.\nWe now compute $A(r)$ for each test radius:\n1. For $r = 0.5$: $r_{eff} = \\max(0.5, 0.02) = 0.5$. $A(0.5) = (\\frac{0.5}{0.5})^{1/3} = 1^{1/3} = 1.0$.\n2. For $r = 0.05$: $r_{eff} = \\max(0.05, 0.02) = 0.05$. $A(0.05) = (\\frac{0.5}{0.05})^{1/3} = 10^{1/3} \\approx 2.154435$.\n3. For $r = 0.005$: $r_{eff} = \\max(0.005, 0.02) = 0.02$. $A(0.005) = (\\frac{0.5}{0.02})^{1/3} = 25^{1/3} \\approx 2.924018$.\n4. For $r = 0$: We use $r_{eval}=0$. $r_{eff} = \\max(0, 0.02) = 0.02$. $A(0) = (\\frac{0.5}{0.02})^{1/3} = 25^{1/3} \\approx 2.924018$.\n5. For $r = 0.2$: $r_{eff} = \\max(0.2, 0.02) = 0.2$. $A(0.2) = (\\frac{0.5}{0.2})^{1/3} = (2.5)^{1/3} \\approx 1.357209$.\n\nRounding to six decimal places, the results for the given test radii in order are: $1.000000$, $2.154435$, $2.924018$, $2.924018$, and $1.357209$.",

            "introduction": "Electromigration-induced failure is inherently a stochastic process, with time-to-failure exhibiting statistical variation due to the complex microstructure of the interconnect. This exercise  immerses you in the practical world of reliability engineering by analyzing time-to-failure data from accelerated tests. You will apply Black's equation, a cornerstone empirical model, within a lognormal statistical framework to extract key parameters like the activation energy $E_a$ and current density exponent $n$. Mastering this type of analysis is essential for predicting device lifetime and ensuring the long-term reliability of integrated circuits.",

            "problem": "An interconnect electromigration accelerated test is performed at multiple current densities and temperatures. The time-to-failure is assumed to be governed by microscopic defect transport consistent with Black’s empirical reliability law and to exhibit a lognormal statistical spread due to microstructural variability. Let the current density $j$ be normalized by $\\mathrm{MA}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ so that $\\ln(j)$ is dimensionless. Under the lognormal assumption, the natural logarithm of time-to-failure $y=\\ln(t/\\mathrm{h})$ is modeled as a Gaussian linear response whose mean is determined by Black’s equation through\n$$\n\\mu(j,T)=\\ln(A)-n\\,\\ln(j)+\\frac{E_{a}}{k_{B} T},\n$$\nwhere $A$ is a pre-exponential factor, $n$ is the current-density exponent, $E_{a}$ is the activation energy, and $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant. Assume a common lognormal shape parameter $\\sigma$ (the standard deviation of $\\ln(t)$) across the stress conditions.\n\nFour stress conditions are applied with current density $j\\in\\{5,10\\}$ and temperature $T\\in\\{400\\,\\mathrm{K},\\,450\\,\\mathrm{K}\\}$, each with six failures recorded.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the established principles of semiconductor reliability physics (Black's law, lognormal failure distribution), is mathematically well-posed, and is presented objectively with all necessary data for a unique solution.\n\nThe stated task is to perform a joint maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) for the parameters of a statistical model describing electromigration time-to-failure. The time-to-failure, $t$, is assumed to follow a lognormal distribution. This implies that its natural logarithm, $y = \\ln(t/\\mathrm{h})$, follows a normal (Gaussian) distribution, $y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$. The mean $\\mu$ is dependent on the stress conditions of current density $j$ and temperature $T$ according to Black's equation, while the standard deviation $\\sigma$ is assumed to be common across all conditions.\n\nThe model for the mean of $y$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mu(j,T) = \\ln(A) - n\\,\\ln(j) + \\frac{E_{a}}{k_{B} T}\n$$\nwhere $\\ln(A)$, $n$, and $E_a$ are the parameters to be estimated. The parameter $\\sigma$ must also be estimated. Let there be $K=4$ experimental conditions, indexed by $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. For each condition $k$, we have $N_k = 6$ measurements, denoted by $y_{k,i}$ for $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, 6\\}$. The total number of measurements is $N = \\sum_{k=1}^{4} N_k = 24$.\n\nUnder the assumption that all $N=24$ measurements are independent, the total log-likelihood function $\\mathcal{L}$ for the parameters $\\ln(A)$, $n$, $E_a$, and $\\sigma$ is the sum of the individual log-likelihoods:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(\\ln(A), n, E_a, \\sigma) = \\sum_{k=1}^{4} \\sum_{i=1}^{6} \\ln \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(y_{k,i} - \\mu_k)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_k = \\mu(j_k, T_k)$. This simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L} = -\\frac{N}{2}\\ln(2\\pi) - N\\ln(\\sigma) - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} \\sum_{k=1}^{4} \\sum_{i=1}^{6} (y_{k,i} - \\mu_k)^2\n$$\nTo find the maximum likelihood estimates, we must find the parameter values that maximize $\\mathcal{L}$. This is equivalent to minimizing the sum of squared errors (SSE), $S = \\sum_{k,i} (y_{k,i} - \\mu_k)^2$, with respect to the parameters defining the mean, and then using the minimized SSE to find $\\sigma$. This is the principle of least squares.\n\nThe model for the mean $\\mu_k$ is linear in the parameters we wish to estimate if we define them as $\\beta_0 = \\ln(A)$, $\\beta_1 = -n$, and $\\beta_2 = E_a$. Let $x_{1,k} = \\ln(j_k)$ and $x_{2,k} = 1/(k_B T_k)$. Then the model is $\\mu_k = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,k} + \\beta_2 x_{2,k}$. This is a multiple linear regression problem.\n\nA standard result in regression is that the least-squares fit can be found by fitting the model to the sample means of the response variable at each unique combination of predictor variables. Let $\\hat{y}_k$ be the sample mean of the $N_k=6$ measurements for condition $k$.\nThe SSE can be decomposed as:\n$$\nS = \\sum_{k=1}^{4} \\sum_{i=1}^{6} (y_{k,i} - \\hat{y}_k)^2 + \\sum_{k=1}^{4} N_k (\\hat{y}_k - \\mu_k)^2\n$$\nThe first term is the within-group sum of squares, which does not depend on the parameters $\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\beta_2$. Thus, minimizing $S$ is equivalent to minimizing the second term, which is a weighted sum of squares of the differences between sample means and model means. Since $N_k=6$ for all $k$, this is equivalent to minimizing $\\sum_{k=1}^{4} (\\hat{y}_k - \\mu_k)^2$.\n\nFirst, we compute the sample mean $\\hat{y}_k$ for each of the four conditions:\n- Condition $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$ ($j=5$, $T=400\\,\\mathrm{K}$): $\\hat{y}_1 = \\frac{1}{6}(7.990562088 + 2 \\times 8.190562088 + 2 \\times 8.590562088 + 8.790562088) = 8.390562088$\n- Condition $\\mathcal{C}_{2}$ ($j=10$, $T=400\\,\\mathrm{K}$): $\\hat{y}_2 = \\frac{1}{6}(7.297414907 + 2 \\times 7.497414907 + 2 \\times 7.897414907 + 8.097414907) = 7.697414907$\n- Condition $\\mathcal{C}_{3}$ ($j=5$, $T=450\\,\\mathrm{K}$): $\\hat{y}_3 = \\frac{1}{6}(5.212784310 + 2 \\times 5.412784310 + 2 \\times 5.812784310 + 6.012784310) = 5.612784310$\n- Condition $\\mathcal{C}_{4}$ ($j=10$, $T=450\\,\\mathrm{K}$): $\\hat{y}_4 = \\frac{1}{6}(4.519637129 + 2 \\times 4.719637129 + 2 \\times 5.119637129 + 5.319637129) = 4.919637129$\n\nWe now have a system of four linear equations based on the four sample means:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\hat{y}_1 = \\ln(A) - n \\ln(5) + E_a / (k_B \\cdot 400) \\\\\n\\hat{y}_2 = \\ln(A) - n \\ln(10) + E_a / (k_B \\cdot 400) \\\\\n\\hat{y}_3 = \\ln(A) - n \\ln(5) + E_a / (k_B \\cdot 450) \\\\\n\\hat{y}_4 = \\ln(A) - n \\ln(10) + E_a / (k_B \\cdot 450)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nDue to the factorial design of the experiment, we can solve for $n$ and $E_a$ by taking differences of these equations.\nSubtracting the second equation from the first:\n$$\n\\hat{y}_1 - \\hat{y}_2 = (-n \\ln(5)) - (-n \\ln(10)) = n (\\ln(10) - \\ln(5)) = n \\ln(2)\n$$\n$$\n8.390562088 - 7.697414907 = 0.693147181 = n \\ln(2)\n$$\nGiven that $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.6931471806$, we find that $\\hat{n} \\approx 1$. The data are constructed such that $\\hat{n}$ is precisely $1$.\nWe can verify this with the third and fourth equations:\n$$\n\\hat{y}_3 - \\hat{y}_4 = 5.612784310 - 4.919637129 = 0.693147181 = n \\ln(2) \\implies \\hat{n}=1\n$$\n\nNext, we solve for $E_a$ by subtracting the third equation from the first:\n$$\n\\hat{y}_1 - \\hat{y}_3 = \\frac{E_a}{k_B} \\left( \\frac{1}{400} - \\frac{1}{450} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n8.390562088 - 5.612784310 = 2.777777778 = \\frac{E_a}{k_B} \\left( \\frac{450-400}{400 \\times 450} \\right) = \\frac{E_a}{k_B} \\frac{50}{180000} = \\frac{E_a}{3600 k_B}\n$$\nRecognizing that $2.777... = 25/9$, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{25}{9} = \\frac{E_a}{3600 k_B} \\implies \\hat{E}_a = \\frac{25 \\times 3600 \\times k_B}{9} = (25 \\times 400) k_B = 10000 k_B\n$$\nUsing the provided value $k_B=8.617333262145 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV/K}$:\n$$\n\\hat{E}_a = 10000 \\times (8.617333262145 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV}) = 0.8617333262145\\,\\mathrm{eV}\n$$\n\nFor completeness, we can estimate $\\ln(A)$. Using the first equation with $\\hat{n}=1$ and $\\hat{E}_a=10000 k_B$:\n$$\n8.390562088 = \\ln(A) - 1 \\times \\ln(5) + \\frac{10000 k_B}{k_B \\cdot 400} = \\ln(A) - \\ln(5) + 25\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(A) = 8.390562088 + \\ln(5) - 25 \\approx 8.390562088 + 1.609437912 - 25 = 10 - 25 = -15\n$$\nThe estimate $\\widehat{\\ln(A)}$ is exactly $-15$.  The fitted model for the mean is $\\hat{\\mu}(j,T) = -15 - \\ln(j) + 10000/T$. This model perfectly predicts the sample means $\\hat{y}_k$, so the term $\\sum N_k(\\hat{y}_k - \\hat{\\mu}_k)^2$ is zero.\n\nTo assess model adequacy, we analyze the residuals, $r_{k,i} = y_{k,i} - \\hat{\\mu}_k$. Since $\\hat{\\mu}_k = \\hat{y}_k$ for our data, the residuals are simply the deviations from the sample means, $y_{k,i} - \\hat{y}_k$. For condition $\\mathcal{C}_1$, with $\\hat{y}_1=8.390562088$, the residuals are $\\{-0.4, -0.2, -0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.4\\}$. The pattern of raw data relative to the first point is identical for all four groups, and so is the pattern of residuals. This non-random structure indicates the artificial nature of the data but does not invalidate the methodology. The assumption of a common standard deviation $\\sigma$ is strongly supported, as the sample variance within each group is identical:\n$s_k^2 = \\frac{1}{N_k-1} \\sum_i (y_{k,i} - \\hat{y}_k)^2 = \\frac{1}{5}[(-0.4)^2 + 2(-0.2)^2 + 2(0.2)^2 + (0.4)^2] = \\frac{1}{5}[0.16 + 0.08 + 0.08 + 0.16] = \\frac{0.48}{5} = 0.096$.\n\nThe MLE for $\\sigma^2$ is based on the total SSE, which is the sum of the within-group sum of squares: $S = \\sum_k \\sum_i (y_{k,i} - \\hat{y}_k)^2 = 4 \\times 0.48 = 1.92$.\n$$\n\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{S}{N} = \\frac{1.92}{24} = 0.08\n$$\nThe MLE for the common shape parameter is $\\hat{\\sigma} = \\sqrt{0.08} = \\sqrt{8/100} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{10} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{5} \\approx 0.2828$.\n\nThe problem asks for the value of the activation energy $E_a$. Rounding the estimated value to four significant figures gives:\n$\\hat{E}_a \\approx 0.8617\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.",
