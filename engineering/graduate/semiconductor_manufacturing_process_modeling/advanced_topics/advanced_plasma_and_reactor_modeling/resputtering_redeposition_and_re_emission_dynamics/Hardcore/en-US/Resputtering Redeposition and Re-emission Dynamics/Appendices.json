This practice delves into this critical relationship by using a common empirical model for sputtering yield, which captures both the initial rise in yield above a threshold energy and its eventual saturation at higher energies. By applying calculus to find the energy that maximizes this yield, we can identify the most impactful energy regime for controlling film erosion and redeposition, essential for tuning final feature profiles.

            "solution": "The problem asks for a self-consistent model of steady-state particle fluxes onto $N$ surfaces in a reactor. The core principle is the conservation of particles at steady state. For any given surface $i$, the total incident flux of particles, $\\Phi_i$, must equal the sum of the flux from external sources, $(\\Phi_0)_i$, and the flux of particles originating from all surfaces (including itself) due to secondary processes like sputtering, re-emission, and redeposition.\n\nLet us formalize the contribution from secondary processes. The total incident flux on surface $j$ is $\\Phi_j$. A fraction of this flux, determined by the sticking probability $s_j \\in [0,1]$, adheres to the surface. The flux of particles sticking to surface $j$ is therefore $s_j \\Phi_j$. The problem defines a transport-emission coupling matrix $P$, where the element $P_{ij}$ represents the expected number of particles arriving at surface $i$ for each particle that sticks on surface $j$. Thus, $P_{ij}$ is a dimensionless quantity that aggregates yields and geometric transport factors.\n\nThe flux of particles arriving at surface $i$ that originated from sticking events on surface $j$ is the product of the sticking flux at $j$ and the coupling factor $P_{ij}$. This contribution is $P_{ij} (s_j \\Phi_j)$. To find the total secondary flux arriving at surface $i$, we must sum the contributions from all surfaces $j = 1, \\dots, N$. This gives the total redeposited flux on surface $i$ as $\\sum_{j=1}^N P_{ij} s_j \\Phi_j$.\n\nWith this, we can write the steady-state flux balance equation for surface $i$:\n$$\n\\Phi_i = (\\Phi_0)_i + \\sum_{j=1}^N P_{ij} s_j \\Phi_j\n$$\nThis represents a system of $N$ linear equations for the $N$ unknown fluxes $\\Phi_1, \\dots, \\Phi_N$. We can express this system more compactly using matrix notation. Let $\\Phi$ be the column vector of total fluxes, and $\\Phi_0$ be the column vector of primary fluxes. The matrix $S$ is defined as a diagonal matrix with elements $S_{jj} = s_j$. The summation term $\\sum_{j=1}^N P_{ij} s_j \\Phi_j$ is the $i$-th element of the matrix-vector product $(PS)\\Phi$. The product of matrix $P$ and diagonal matrix $S$ results in a matrix $(PS)$ with elements $(PS)_{ij} = P_{ij}s_j$.\n\nTherefore, the self-consistent linear equation governing the steady-state total incident flux vector $\\Phi$ is:\n$$\n\\Phi = \\Phi_0 + (PS)\\Phi\n$$\n\nTo solve for $\\Phi$, we rearrange the equation to group terms involving $\\Phi$:\n$$\n\\Phi - (PS)\\Phi = \\Phi_0\n$$\nFactoring out $\\Phi$ and using the identity matrix $I$ of size $N \\times N$, we obtain:\n$$\n(I - PS)\\Phi = \\Phi_0\n$$\nThis is a standard linear system of the form $Ax=b$, where the matrix to be solved is $A = (I - PS)$, the unknown vector is $x = \\Phi$, and the constant vector is $b = \\Phi_0$.\n\nThe system is well-posed and has a unique solution if and only if the matrix $(I - PS)$ is invertible (non-singular). The problem provides a physical basis for this condition: \"the combined transport-emission process remains bounded.\" This statement can be interpreted through a Neumann series expansion. The total flux $\\Phi$ can be seen as the sum of the initial flux $\\Phi_0$, the flux after one generation of redeposition, $(PS)\\Phi_0$, the flux after two generations, $(PS)^2\\Phi_0$, and so on:\n$$\n\\Phi = \\Phi_0 + PS(\\Phi_0 + PS\\Phi_0 + \\dots) = \\Phi_0 + (PS)\\Phi_0 + (PS)^2\\Phi_0 + \\dots = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (PS)^k\\right) \\Phi_0\n$$\nThis geometric series of matrices converges if and only if the spectral radius of the matrix $PS$, denoted $\\rho(PS)$, is strictly less than $1$. The spectral radius is the maximum of the absolute values of the eigenvalues of the matrix. If $\\rho(PS)  1$, then the matrix $(I - PS)$ is guaranteed to be invertible, and its inverse is given by the sum of this series: $(I - PS)^{-1} = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (PS)^k$.\n\nThe physical condition of a bounded process translates directly to the mathematical condition $\\rho(PS)  1$. If $\\rho(PS) \\ge 1$, at least one mode of particle exchange would be self-sustaining or divergent, leading to an unphysical infinite flux. Since all elements of $P$ and $S$ are non-negative, the elements of $PS$ are also non-negative. By the Perron-Frobenius theorem for non-negative matrices, the condition $\\rho(PS)  1$ ensures that $(I-PS)^{-1}$ exists and has all non-negative elements, which guarantees a physically meaningful non-negative flux vector $\\Phi$ for any non-negative primary flux $\\Phi_0$. The mathematical object that must be inverted is the matrix $(I - PS)$.\n\nThe explicit closed-form solution for the total steady-state incident flux vector $\\Phi$ is obtained by pre-multiplying both sides of the linear system by the inverse of $(I-PS)$:\n$$\n(I - PS)^{-1}(I - PS)\\Phi = (I - PS)^{-1}\\Phi_0\n$$\n$$\n\\Phi = (I - PS)^{-1}\\Phi_0\n$$\nThe necessary and sufficient condition for this unique, physically meaningful solution to exist is that the spectral radius of the matrix $PS$ is less than one, i.e., $\\rho(PS)  1$. This condition is satisfied for all test cases provided, as the nature of the transport parameters ensures a dissipative rather than a divergent system. For implementation, solving the linear system $(I - PS)\\Phi = \\Phi_0$ directly is numerically more stable and efficient than explicitly calculating the inverse matrix.",
