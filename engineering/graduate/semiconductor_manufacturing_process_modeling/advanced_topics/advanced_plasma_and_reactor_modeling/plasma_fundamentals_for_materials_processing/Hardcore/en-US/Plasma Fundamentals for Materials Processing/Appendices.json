            "solution": "### Principle-Based Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires us to compute the kinetic energy of an argon ion as it impacts a substrate after traversing a radio-frequency (RF) modulated plasma sheath. The ion's motion is governed by fundamental principles of classical mechanics and electromagnetism.\n\n#### 1. Formulation of the Physical Model\n\nAn argon ion, with charge $q$ and mass $m_i$, enters a planar sheath of constant thickness $s$ at position $x=0$ and time $t=0$. The substrate is located at $x=s$. The ion's initial velocity is the Bohm speed, $v(0) = v_B$.\n\nThe electric potential difference across the sheath, $V_s(t)$, is time-dependent due to the applied RF voltage and a DC self-bias. It is given by:\n$$\nV_s(t) = V_{\\mathrm{dc}} + V_{\\mathrm{rf}} \\sin(\\omega t + \\phi_0)\n$$\nwhere $V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$ is the DC bias voltage, $V_{\\mathrm{rf}}$ is the amplitude of the RF voltage, $\\omega = 2\\pi f$ is the angular frequency, and $\\phi_0$ is the phase of the RF field at the moment the ion enters the sheath.\n\nUnder the matrix-sheath approximation, the electric field $E(t)$ is assumed to be spatially uniform within the sheath ($0 \\le x \\le s$):\n$$\nE(t) = \\frac{V_s(t)}{s}\n$$\nThe force exerted on the ion is $F(t) = q E(t)$. Since $V_{\\mathrm{dc}} > V_{\\mathrm{rf}}$ in all specified cases, $V_s(t)$ is always positive, and the force continuously accelerates the positive ion towards the substrate at $x=s$.\n\n#### 2. Equation of Motion\n\nThe ion's one-dimensional motion is described by Newton's second law:\n$$\nm_i \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = F(t) = q E(t)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the electric field, we obtain the second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the ion's position $x(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = \\frac{q}{m_i s} \\left( V_{\\mathrm{dc}} + V_{\\mathrm{rf}} \\sin(\\omega t + \\phi_0) \\right)\n$$\nThe initial conditions are:\n-   Initial position: $x(0) = 0$\n-   Initial velocity: $v(0) = \\frac{dx}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} = v_B$\n\nThe Bohm speed $v_B$ is the minimum speed required for a stable sheath to form and is given by the problem as:\n$$\nv_B = \\sqrt{\\frac{q T_e}{m_i}}\n$$\nwhere $T_e$ is the electron temperature given in units of electronvolts (eV).\n\n#### 3. Numerical Solution Strategy\n\nThe governing equation is a non-homogeneous second-order ODE with a time-dependent forcing term. An analytical solution is not straightforward. Therefore, a numerical approach is required. We first convert the second-order ODE into a system of two first-order ODEs. Let the state vector be $\\mathbf{y}(t) = [y_0(t), y_1(t)]^T = [x(t), v(t)]^T$, where $v(t) = \\frac{dx}{dt}$ is the ion's velocity. The system of ODEs is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{y}}{dt} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{dy_0}{dt} \\\\\n\\frac{dy_1}{dt}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\ny_1 \\\\\n\\frac{q}{m_i s} \\left( V_{\\mathrm{dc}} + V_{\\mathrm{rf}} \\sin(\\omega t + \\phi_0) \\right)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe initial condition for the state vector at $t=0$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{y}(0) = \\begin{pmatrix} x(0) \\\\ v(0) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ v_B \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThis initial value problem can be solved using a standard numerical ODE integrator, such as the `solve_ivp` function from Python's `scipy.integrate` library. The integration proceeds from $t=0$ until the ion reaches the substrate. This defines the arrival time, $t^\\ast$, as the time when the position $x(t^\\ast) = s$. This condition is implemented as an \"event\" for the ODE solver, which stops the integration precisely when the condition is met.\n\n#### 4. Calculation of Arrival Kinetic Energy\n\nOnce the solver finds the arrival time $t^\\ast$ and the state vector $\\mathbf{y}(t^\\ast) = [x(t^\\ast), v(t^\\ast)]^T$, the arrival velocity is $v(t^\\ast)$. The arrival kinetic energy in Joules is:\n$$\nK(t^\\ast) = \\frac{1}{2} m_i [v(t^\\ast)]^2\n$$\nTo express this energy in electronvolts (eV), as required, we divide by the elementary charge $q$:\n$$\nK_{\\mathrm{eV}}(t^\\ast) = \\frac{K(t^\\ast)}{q} = \\frac{m_i [v(t^\\ast)]^2}{2q}\n$$\nThis calculation is performed for each specified parameter set and for each of the four entry phases $\\phi_0 \\in \\{0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi, \\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\}$. The resulting energy values are then rounded to three decimal places.\n\nThe overall algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Initialize physical constants $q$ and $m_i$.\n2.  Iterate through each parameter set $(V_{\\mathrm{dc}}, V_{\\mathrm{rf}}, f, s, T_e)$.\n3.  For each set, calculate the angular frequency $\\omega = 2\\pi f$ and the initial Bohm velocity $v_B$.\n4.  Iterate through each entry phase $\\phi_0 \\in \\{0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi, \\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\}$.\n5.  Set up the initial state vector $\\mathbf{y}(0) = [0, v_B]$.\n6.  Call a numerical ODE solver (e.g., `solve_ivp`) with the system of first-order ODEs, the initial state, and an event function that triggers when $x(t) = s$.\n7.  Extract the final velocity $v(t^\\ast)$ from the solver's output at the event time.\n8.  Calculate the final kinetic energy in eV, $K_{\\mathrm{eV}}$.\n9.
