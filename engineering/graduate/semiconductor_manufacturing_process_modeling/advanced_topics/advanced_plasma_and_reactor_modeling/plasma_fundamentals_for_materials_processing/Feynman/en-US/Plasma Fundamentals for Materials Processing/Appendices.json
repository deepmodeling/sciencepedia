            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the screening length for an electrostatic potential perturbation in a quasi-neutral plasma, and the subsequent calculation of a dimensionless quasi-neutrality metric $Q$.\n\nWe start from Poisson's equation for the electrostatic potential $\\phi$:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\phi = -\\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0}\n$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the net charge density and $\\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.

In the unperturbed equilibrium state ($\\phi = 0$), the plasma is charge-neutral, which implies that the background ion density, $n_{i0}$, is equal to the background electron density, $n_{e0}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement describes a classic physical model of a collisionless ion sheath, specifically in the space-charge-limited regime governed by the Child-Langmuir law. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all necessary parameters for a unique solution are provided. It is therefore deemed a valid problem. We proceed with the derivation from first principles.\n\nWe model the sheath as a one-dimensional region between the quasi-neutral plasma bulk and a planar wafer electrode. Let the plasma-sheath boundary be at position $x=0$ and the wafer electrode at $x=d$. The electric potential $V(x)$ is defined relative to the plasma, so the potential at the sheath edge is $V(0)=0$. The electrode is biased negatively to attract ions, so its potential is $V(d) = -V_s$, where $V_s$ is the given sheath voltage drop, a positive value.\n\nThe derivation is based on three fundamental principles as stipulated:\n\n1.  **Poisson’s Equation**: The space charge in the sheath is dominated by positive ions, as the electron density is assumed to be negligible. The space charge density is $\\rho(x) = q n_i(x)$, where $n_i(x)$ is the ion number density and $q$ is the elementary charge for singly charged ions. Poisson's equation in one dimension is:\n    $$ \\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\varepsilon_0} = -\\frac{q n_i(x)}{\\varepsilon_0} $$\n\n2.  **Steady Ion Current Continuity**: In steady state, the ion current density $J$ is constant throughout the sheath. It is related to the ion density and ion velocity $v_i(x)$ by:\n    $$ J = q n_i(x) v_i(x) $$\n    From this, we can express the ion density as $n_i(x) = \\frac{J}{q v_i(x)}$.\n\n3.  **Ion Energy Conservation**: For a collisionless sheath, the total energy of an ion is conserved. For the Child-Langmuir model, we make the standard assumption that ions enter the sheath at $x=0$ with zero initial velocity, $v_i(0)=0$. This is a key aspect of the \"space-charge-limited\" regime. As an ion moves from $x=0$ to a position $x$ inside the sheath, it is accelerated by the electric field, and its kinetic energy gain is equal to the potential energy loss:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{2}m_i v_i(x)^2 - \\frac{1}{2}m_i v_i(0)^2 = qV(0) - qV(x) $$\n    With $v_i(0)=0$ and $V(0)=0$, this simplifies to:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{2}m_i v_i(x)^2 = -qV(x) $$\n    Note that for $x0$, $V(x)$ is negative, so the right-hand side is positive. The ion velocity is thus:\n    $$ v_i(x) = \\sqrt{-\\frac{2qV(x)}{m_i}} $$\n\nNow, we combine these three equations. First, substitute the expression for $v_i(x)$ into the continuity equation to find $n_i(x)$ in terms of $V(x)$:\n$$ n_i(x) = \\frac{J}{q v_i(x)} = \\frac{J}{q \\sqrt{-\\frac{2qV(x)}{m_i}}} = \\frac{J}{\\sqrt{-\\frac{2q^3V(x)}{m_i}}} $$\nNext, substitute this expression for $n_i(x)$ into Poisson’s equation:\n$$ \\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} = -\\frac{q}{\\varepsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{J}{\\sqrt{-\\frac{2q^3V(x)}{m_i}}} \\right) = -\\frac{J}{\\varepsilon_0} \\sqrt{\\frac{q^2 m_i}{-2q^3V(x)}} = -\\frac{J}{\\varepsilon_0} \\sqrt{\\frac{m_i}{-2qV(x)}} $$\nThis can be written as:\n$$ \\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} = \\left(-\\frac{J}{\\varepsilon_0} \\sqrt{\\frac{m_i}{2q}}\\right) (-V)^{-1/2} $$\nThis is a second-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation for $V(x)$. To solve it, we require two boundary conditions. The first two are $V(0)=0$ and $V(d)=-V_s$. A third condition arises from the space-charge-limited flow assumption: the electric field at the ion source (the sheath edge) is zero, $E(0) = -\\left.\\frac{dV}{dx}\\right|_{x=0} = 0$.\n\nTo solve the ODE, we multiply by $2\\frac{dV}{dx}$ and integrate with respect to $x$:\n$$ 2 \\frac{dV}{dx} \\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left[\\left(\\frac{dV}{dx}\\right)^2\\right] = 2\\left(-\\frac{J}{\\varepsilon_0} \\sqrt{\\frac{m_i}{2q}}\\right) (-V)^{-1/2} \\frac{dV}{dx} $$\nIntegrating from $x=0$ to an arbitrary $x$ gives:\n$$ \\int_0^x \\frac{d}{dx'}\\left[\\left(\\fracdV}{dx'}\\right)^2\\right] dx' = - \\frac{2J}{\\varepsilon_0} \\sqrt{\\frac{m_i}{2q}} \\int_{V(0)}^{V(x)} (-V')^{-1/2} dV' $$\nUsing the boundary conditions $V(0)=0$ and $\\left.\\frac{dV}{dx}\\right|_{x=0}=0$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{dV}{dx}\\right)^2 = - \\frac{2J}{\\varepsilon_0} \\sqrt{\\frac{m_i}{2q}} \\left[ -2(-V')^{1/2} \\right]_0^{V(x)} = \\frac{4J}{\\varepsilon_0} \\sqrt{\\frac{m_i}{2q}} (-V)^{1/2} $$\nTaking the square root (we choose the negative root since $V$ decreases as $x$ increases):\n$$ \\frac{dV}{dx} = - \\left( \\frac{4J}{\\varepsilon_0} \\sqrt{\\frac{m_i}{2q}} \\right)^{1/2} (-V)^{1/4} $$\nWe separate variables and integrate again, this time from $x=0$ to $x=d$:\n$$ \\int_{V(0)}^{V(d)} (-V)^{-1/4} dV = - \\left( \\frac{4J}{\\varepsilon_0} \\sqrt{\\frac{m_i}{2q}} \\right)^{1/2} \\int_0^d dx $$\nUsing the boundary conditions $V(0)=0$ and $V(d)=-V_s$:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{-V_s} (-V)^{-1/4} dV = - \\left( \\frac{4J}{\\varepsilon_0} \\sqrt{\\frac{m_i}{2q}} \\right)^{1/2} d $$\nThe integral on the left evaluates to $\\left[-\\frac{4}{3}(-V)^{3/4}\\right]_0^{-V_s} = -\\frac{4}{3}V_s^{3/4}$.\n$$ -\\frac{4}{3}V_s^{3/4} = - \\left( \\frac{4J}{\\varepsilon_0} \\sqrt{\\frac{m_i}{2q}} \\right)^{1/2} d $$\nSolving for $d$:\n$$ d = \\frac{4 V_s^{3/4}}{3} \\left( \\frac{4J}{\\varepsilon_0} \\sqrt{\\frac{m_i}{2q}} \\right)^{-1/2} = \\frac{4V_s^{3/4}}{3 \\cdot 2} \\left( \\frac{J}{\\varepsilon_0} \\sqrt{\\frac{m_i}{2q}} \\right)^{-1/2} $$\n$$ d = \\frac{2}{3} V_s^{3/4} J^{-1/2} \\varepsilon_0^{1/2} \\left(\\frac{m_i}{2q}\\right)^{1/4} = \\frac{2}{3} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_0}{J}} \\left(\\frac{m_i}{2q}\\right)^{1/4} V_s^{3/4} $$\nIt is conventional to write this relation by solving for $J$, which is the Child-Langmuir law:\n$$ J = \\frac{4\\varepsilon_0}{9} \\sqrt{\\frac{2q}{m_i}} \\frac{V_s^{3/2}}{d^2} $$\nThe scaling law connecting $d$ to the other parameters is obtained by rearranging this for $d$:\n$$ d = \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\varepsilon_0}{9J} \\sqrt{\\frac{2q}{m_i}} V_s^{3/2}} $$\nThis result shows that the sheath thickness $d$ scales with the sheath voltage as $d \\propto V_s^{3/4}$ and with the ion current density as $d \\propto J^{-1/2}$. This implies that the sheath thickness is more sensitive to changes in voltage (power of $0.75$) than to changes in current density (power of $-0.5$). Increasing the sheath voltage expands the sheath to support the larger potential drop, while increasing the ion current density (i.e., the amount of charge in the sheath) allows the same voltage to be dropped over a shorter distance, thus compressing the sheath.\n\nWe now compute the numerical value for $d$ using the provided parameters, all in SI units:\n$J = 10 \\, \\mathrm{A\\,m^{-2}}$\n$V_s = 100 \\, \\mathrm{V}$\n$q = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\mathrm{C}$\n$m_i = 6.6335 \\times 10^{-26} \\, \\mathrm{kg}$\n$\\varepsilon_0 = 8.8541878128 \\times 10^{-12} \\, \\mathrm{F\\,m^{-1}}$\n\nFirst, calculate the term under the inner square root:\n$$ \\frac{2q}{m_i} = \\frac{2 \\times (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\mathrm{C})}{6.6335 \\times 10^{-26} \\, \\mathrm{kg}} \\approx 4.830605 \\times 10^6 \\, \\mathrm{C \\, kg^{-1}} $$\nNow substitute all values into the expression for $d^2$:\n$$ d^2 = \\frac{4 \\varepsilon_0}{9 J} \\sqrt{\\frac{2q}{m_i}} V_s^{3/2} $$\n$$ d^2 = \\frac{4 \\times (8.8541878 \\times 10^{-12})}{9 \\times 10} \\sqrt{4.830605 \\times 10^6} \\times (100)^{3/2} $$\n$$ d^2 = \\left(\\frac{3.541675 \\times 10^{-11}}{90}\\right) \\times (2197.864) \\times (1000) \\, \\mathrm{m^2} $$\n$$ d^2 = (3.935194 \\times 10^{-13}) \\times (2197.864) \\times (1000) \\, \\mathrm{m^2} $$\n$$ d^2 \\approx 8.6489 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\mathrm{m^2} $$\nTaking the square root to find $d$:\n$$ d = \\sqrt{8.6489 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\mathrm{m^2}} \\approx 9.2999 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\mathrm{m} $$\nThe problem asks for the result in millimeters, rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ d \\approx 9.2999 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\mathrm{m} \\times \\frac{1000 \\, \\mathrm{mm}}{1 \\, \\mathrm{m}} \\approx 0.92999 \\, \\mathrm{mm} $$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $d = 0.930 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$.",

It is given by:\n$$\nV_s(t) = V_{\\mathrm{dc}} + V_{\\mathrm{rf}} \\sin(\\omega t + \\phi_0)\n$$\nwhere $V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$ is the DC bias voltage, $V_{\\mathrm{rf}}$ is the amplitude of the RF voltage, $\\omega = 2\\pi f$ is the angular frequency, and $\\phi_0$ is the phase of the RF field at the moment the ion enters the sheath.\n\nUnder the matrix-sheath approximation, the electric field $E(t)$ is assumed to be spatially uniform within the sheath ($0 \\le x \\le s$):\n$$\nE(t) = \\frac{V_s(t)}{s}\n$$\nThe force exerted on the ion is $F(t) = q E(t)$. Since $V_{\\mathrm{dc}} > V_{\\mathrm{rf}}$ in all specified cases, $V_s(t)$ is always positive, and the force continuously accelerates the positive ion towards the substrate at $x=s$.\n\n#### 2. Equation of Motion\n\nThe ion's one-dimensional motion is described by Newton's second law:\n$$\nm_i \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = F(t) = q E(t)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the electric field, we obtain the second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the ion's position $x(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = \\frac{q}{m_i s} \\left( V_{\\mathrm{dc}} + V_{\\mathrm{rf}} \\sin(\\omega t + \\phi_0) \\right)\n$$\nThe initial conditions are:\n-   Initial position: $x(0) = 0$\n-   Initial velocity: $v(0) = \\frac{dx}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} = v_B$\n\nThe Bohm speed $v_B$ is the minimum speed required for a stable sheath to form and is given by the problem as:\n$$\nv_B = \\sqrt{\\frac{q T_e}{m_i}}\n$$\nwhere $T_e$ is the electron temperature given in units of electronvolts (eV).\n\n#### 3. Numerical Solution Strategy\n\nThe governing equation is a non-homogeneous second-order ODE with a time-dependent forcing term. An analytical solution is not straightforward. Therefore, a numerical approach is required. We first convert the second-order ODE into a system of two first-order ODEs. Let the state vector be $\\mathbf{y}(t) = [y_0(t), y_1(t)]^T = [x(t), v(t)]^T$, where $v(t) = \\frac{dx}{dt}$ is the ion's velocity. The system of ODEs is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{y}}{dt} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{dy_0}{dt} \\\\\n\\frac{dy_1}{dt}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\ny_1 \\\\\n\\frac{q}{m_i s} \\left( V_{\\mathrm{dc}} + V_{\\mathrm{rf}} \\sin(\\omega t + \\phi_0) \\right)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe initial condition for the state vector at $t=0$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{y}(0) = \\begin{pmatrix} x(0) \\\\ v(0) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ v_B \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThis initial value problem can be solved using a standard numerical ODE integrator, such as the `solve_ivp` function from Python's `scipy.integrate` library. The integration proceeds from $t=0$ until the ion reaches the substrate. This defines the arrival time, $t^\\ast$, as the time when the position $x(t^\\ast) = s$. This condition is implemented as an \"event\" for the ODE solver, which stops the integration precisely when the condition is met.\n\n#### 4. Calculation of Arrival Kinetic Energy\n\nOnce the solver finds the arrival time $t^\\ast$ and the state vector $\\mathbf{y}(t^\\ast) = [x(t^\\ast), v(t^\\ast)]^T$, the arrival velocity is $v(t^\\ast)$. The arrival kinetic energy in Joules is:\n$$\nK(t^\\ast) = \\frac{1}{2} m_i [v(t^\\ast)]^2\n$$\nTo express this energy in electronvolts (eV), as required, we divide by the elementary charge $q$:\n$$\nK_{\\mathrm{eV}}(t^\\ast) = \\frac{K(t^\\ast)}{q} = \\frac{m_i [v(t^\\ast)]^2}{2q}\n$$\nThis calculation is performed for each specified parameter set and for each of the four entry phases $\\phi_0 \\in \\{0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi, \\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\}$. The resulting energy values are then rounded to three decimal places.\n\nThe overall algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Initialize physical constants $q$ and $m_i$.\n2.  Iterate through each parameter set $(V_{\\mathrm{dc}}, V_{\\mathrm{rf}}, f, s, T_e)$.\n3.  For each set, calculate the angular frequency $\\omega = 2\\pi f$ and the initial Bohm velocity $v_B$.\n4.  Iterate through each entry phase $\\phi_0 \\in \\{0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi, \\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\}$.\n5.  Set up the initial state vector $\\mathbf{y}(0) = [0, v_B]$.\n6.  Call a numerical ODE solver (e.g., `solve_ivp`) with the system of first-order ODEs, the initial state, and an event function that triggers when $x(t) = s$.\n7.  Extract the final velocity $v(t^\\ast)$ from the solver's output at the event time.\n8.  Calculate the final kinetic energy in eV, $K_{\\mathrm{eV}}$.\n9.  Round the result to three decimal places and store it.\n10. After all cases are processed, format the collected results into the specified string format.",
