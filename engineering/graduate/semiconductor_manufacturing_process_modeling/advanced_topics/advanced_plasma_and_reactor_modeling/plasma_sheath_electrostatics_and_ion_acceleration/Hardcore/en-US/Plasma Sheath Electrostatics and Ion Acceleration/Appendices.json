            "problem": "A planar capacitively coupled plasma (CCP) etch reactor operating in argon features a presheath and an electrostatic sheath adjacent to a negatively biased electrode. Assume singly charged argon ions ($\\mathrm{Ar}^{+}$), an electron population that is Maxwellian with temperature $T_e=3$ eV, negligible ion temperature ($T_i \\approx 0$), and a steady, one-dimensional sheath edge located at $x=0$ where quasineutrality breaks. The presheath accelerates ions toward the sheath edge. Starting from fundamental continuum and electrostatic relations, derive the minimal ion kinetic energy at the sheath edge.\n\nAs the fundamental base, use the following:\n- Ion continuity: $n_i u_i = \\text{constant}$.\n- Cold-ion momentum balance: $m_i u_i \\,\\dfrac{d u_i}{d x} = - e \\,\\dfrac{d \\phi}{d x}$.\n- Electron Boltzmann relation: $n_e = n_{e0} \\exp\\!\\left(\\dfrac{e \\phi}{k_B T_e}\\right)$.\n- Poisson’s equation: $\\dfrac{d^2 \\phi}{d x^2} = - \\dfrac{e}{\\epsilon_0}\\left(n_i - n_e\\right)$.\n\nHere, $n_i$ and $n_e$ are the ion and electron number densities, $u_i$ is the ion fluid speed, $m_i$ is the ion mass, $e$ is the elementary charge, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $\\phi$ is the electrostatic potential, and $\\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the minimal kinetic energy an ion must possess upon entering an electrostatic sheath from a quasineutral plasma. This condition is known as the Bohm sheath criterion. The derivation will be based on the provided one-dimensional fluid equations.\n\nWe are given the following set of equations:\n1.  Ion continuity: $n_i u_i = \\text{constant}$\n2.  Cold-ion momentum balance: $m_i u_i \\dfrac{d u_i}{d x} = - e \\dfrac{d \\phi}{d x}$\n3.  Electron Boltzmann relation: $n_e = n_{e0} \\exp\\left(\\dfrac{e \\phi}{k_B T_e}\\right)$\n4.  Poisson’s equation: $\\dfrac{d^2 \\phi}{d x^2} = - \\dfrac{e}{\\epsilon_0}\\left(n_i - n_e\\right)$\n\nThe sheath edge is located at $x=0$. At this boundary, we define the reference potential as $\\phi(0) = 0$. The plasma is quasineutral up to this point, so the ion and electron densities are approximately equal: $n_i(0) \\approx n_e(0)$. We denote this sheath-edge density as $n_0$. The ion fluid speed at the sheath edge is $u_i(0) = u_0$. The electron density at any point is therefore given relative to the sheath-edge density $n_0$, so $n_e(\\phi) = n_0 \\exp\\left(\\dfrac{e \\phi}{k_B T_e}\\right)$.\n\nFirst, we express the ion density $n_i$ as a function of the local potential $\\phi$. The ion continuity equation states $n_i u_i = n_0 u_0$, which gives $n_i = n_0 \\frac{u_0}{u_i}$.\nThe ion momentum equation describes the conservation of energy for the ions. We can integrate it from the sheath edge (where $u_i=u_0$ and $\\phi=0$) to a position $x$ inside the sheath:\n$$ \\int_{u_0}^{u_i(x)} m_i u'_i d u'_i = \\int_{0}^{\\phi(x)} -e d\\phi' $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} m_i u_i^2 - \\frac{1}{2} m_i u_0^2 = -e\\phi $$\nThis shows that the total energy of an ion fluid element is conserved. Rearranging for $u_i^2$:\n$$ u_i^2 = u_0^2 - \\frac{2e\\phi}{m_i} $$\nSince the electrode is negatively biased, the potential becomes negative for $x0$, so $\\phi  0$. This means the term $-e\\phi$ is positive, and ions are accelerated as they move into the sheath ($u_i  u_0$). The ion speed is $u_i = \\sqrt{u_0^2 - \\frac{2e\\phi}{m_i}}$.\nSubstituting this into the continuity relation for $n_i$:\n$$ n_i(\\phi) = n_0 \\frac{u_0}{\\sqrt{u_0^2 - \\frac{2e\\phi}{m_i}}} = n_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{2e\\phi}{m_i u_0^2}\\right)^{-1/2} $$\n\nA stable sheath must be able to shield the plasma from the electrode potential. This requires a net positive space charge to build up immediately inside the sheath. For an infinitesimally small step into the sheath (where $\\phi$ is infinitesimally negative), the ion density must be greater than the electron density: $n_i  n_e$.\nAt the sheath edge itself, we have quasineutrality: $n_i(0) = n_e(0) = n_0$. The condition for sheath formation is thus:\n$$ n_i(\\phi)  n_e(\\phi) \\quad \\text{for } \\phi \\to 0^{-} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $n_i$ and $n_e$:\n$$ n_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{2e\\phi}{m_i u_0^2}\\right)^{-1/2}  n_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{e\\phi}{k_B T_e}\\right) $$\nTo analyze this inequality for small $\\phi$, we perform a Taylor expansion of both sides around $\\phi=0$. Let $y = -e\\phi  0$. The inequality becomes:\n$$ \\left(1 + \\frac{2y}{m_i u_0^2}\\right)^{-1/2}  \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y}{k_B T_e}\\right) $$\nUsing the expansions $(1+z)^a \\approx 1 + az$ and $\\exp(z) \\approx 1+z$ for small $z$:\n$$ 1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{2y}{m_i u_0^2}\\right) + O(y^2)  1 - \\frac{y}{k_B T_e} + O(y^2) $$\n$$ 1 - \\frac{y}{m_i u_0^2}  1 - \\frac{y}{k_B T_e} $$\n$$ -\\frac{y}{m_i u_0^2}  -\\frac{y}{k_B T_e} $$\nSince $y  0$, we can divide by $-y$, which reverses the inequality sign:\n$$ \\frac{1}{m_i u_0^2}  \\frac{1}{k_B T_e} \\implies m_i u_0^2  k_B T_e $$\nThis gives the condition for the formation of a stable sheath. The minimal case occurs at the boundary of this condition. Let's check the equality case, $m_i u_0^2 = k_B T_e$. In this case, the first-order terms of the expansion are equal. We must expand to the second order.\nUsing $(1+z)^{-1/2} \\approx 1 - \\frac{1}{2}z + \\frac{3}{8}z^2$ and $\\exp(w) \\approx 1+w+\\frac{1}{2}w^2$:\nLeft side: $1 - \\frac{y}{m_i u_0^2} + \\frac{3}{8}\\left(\\frac{2y}{m_i u_0^2}\\right)^2 = 1 - \\frac{y}{m_i u_0^2} + \\frac{3}{2}\\frac{y^2}{(m_i u_0^2)^2}$\nRight side: $1 - \\frac{y}{k_B T_e} + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(-\\frac{y}{k_B T_e}\\right)^2 = 1 - \\frac{y}{k_B T_e} + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{y^2}{(k_B T_e)^2}$\nSetting $m_i u_0^2 = k_B T_e$, the first-order terms cancel, and the inequality becomes:\n$$ \\frac{3}{2}\\frac{y^2}{(k_B T_e)^2}  \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{y^2}{(k_B T_e)^2} $$\nThis simplifies to $\\frac{3}{2}  \\frac{1}{2}$, which is true. Therefore, the sheath condition $n_i  n_e$ is satisfied even in the limiting case. The minimal condition for sheath formation is the equality.\n\nThe minimal ion speed required at the sheath edge is therefore given by:\n$$ m_i u_{0, \\text{min}}^2 = k_B T_e $$\nThe minimal ion speed is $u_{0, \\text{min}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T_e}{m_i}}$. This speed is known as the ion sound speed, $c_s$, for cold ions.\nThe corresponding minimal ion kinetic energy, $E_i$, at the sheath edge ($x=0$) is:\n$$ E_{i, \\text{min}} = \\frac{1}{2} m_i u_{0, \\text{min}}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m_i \\left(\\frac{k_B T_e}{m_i}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} k_B T_e $$\nThis is the Bohm criterion. It states that ions must enter the sheath with a kinetic energy of at least half the electron temperature (expressed in energy units).\n\nTo evaluate this numerically, we are given $T_e = 3$ eV. The unit \"electronvolt\" (eV) is a unit of energy. When a temperature is given in eV, it refers to the thermal energy $k_B T_e$. Thus, $k_B T_e$ is equivalent to an energy of $3$ eV.\nThe minimal ion kinetic energy is:\n$$ E_{i, \\text{min}} = \\frac{1}{2} (3 \\text{ eV}) = 1.5 \\text{ eV} $$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $1.50$ eV. The provided mass of the argon ion is not necessary for this part of the calculation, as the result is independent of ion mass when expressed in terms of $k_B T_e$.\n\nFinally, a brief discussion on the influence of this entry energy on ion acceleration in a CCP. In a CCP reactor, the sheath potential oscillates at a radio frequency (RF). An ion entering the sheath at $x=0$ with the minimal Bohm energy, $E_i = \\frac{1}{2}k_B T_e$, is then accelerated by this time-varying potential. The final energy and the energy distribution of ions striking the electrode depend on the ratio of the ion transit time across the sheath, $\\tau_{ion}$, to the RF period, $\\tau_{RF}$.\nThe initial velocity $u_0 = \\sqrt{2 E_i / m_i}$ is the starting condition for an ion's trajectory. This velocity, along with the sheath width and potential, determines $\\tau_{ion}$.\nIf $\\tau_{ion} \\gg \\tau_{RF}$, ions are too heavy to respond to the instantaneous field and are accelerated by the time-averaged sheath potential, resulting in a narrow, single-peaked ion energy distribution (IED) at the electrode. The total average energy is approximately $E_{final} \\approx E_i + e\\langle\\Phi_s\\rangle$, where $\\langle\\Phi_s\\rangle$ is the average sheath potential drop.\nIf $\\tau_{ion} \\ll \\tau_{RF}$, ions cross the sheath so quickly that they experience a nearly constant potential, leading to a broad IED that reflects the probability distribution of the sheath voltage.\nThe Bohm energy, $E_i$, sets the non-zero initial speed. A higher $T_e$ leads to a higher $E_i$ and a higher initial speed, which in turn reduces $\\tau_{ion}$. This can shift the ion dynamics from the time-averaged regime towards the instantaneous-field regime, thus altering the shape of the IED. Therefore, the sheath-edge entry condition is a crucial parameter that influences the entire dynamic of ion acceleration and the resulting energy distribution impacting the substrate, which is a critical factor in etch processes.",

            "solution": "### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem asks for the expected loss in an ion's kinetic energy at the wall ($x=d$) due to a single charge-exchange collision, averaged over all possible collision locations. The ion is singly charged, so its charge is $q=e$, the elementary charge.\n\n1.  **Kinetic Energy in the Collisionless Case**\n    In the absence of collisions, an ion starts with negligible kinetic energy at the plasma-sheath edge ($x=0$) where the potential is $\\phi(0) = V_{s}\\left(\\frac{0}{d}\\right)^{\\frac{4}{3}} = 0$.

The potential energy change is $\\Delta U = q(\\phi(d) - \\phi(0)) = e(V_s - 0) = e V_s$. Thus, the final kinetic energy is:\n    $$K_{\\text{no-collision}} = e V_s$$\n\n2.  **Kinetic Energy with a Single Collision**\n    Suppose a single charge-exchange collision occurs at a random location $x$ within the sheath, where $x \\in [0,d]$. At this point, the original ion is neutralized, and a new, slow ion is created with negligible initial kinetic energy. This new ion is then accelerated by the remaining potential drop from its point of creation, $x$, to the wall, $d$.\n    The potential at the creation point $x$ is $\\phi(x) = V_{s}\\left(\\frac{x}{d}\\right)^{\\frac{4}{3}}$.\n    The potential difference experienced by this new ion is $\\Delta\\phi = \\phi(d) - \\phi(x) = V_s - V_s\\left(\\frac{x}{d}\\right)^{\\frac{4}{3}}$.\n    The kinetic energy of this ion upon impact with the wall, denoted $K_{\\text{collision}}(x)$, is:\n    $$K_{\\text{collision}}(x) = e (\\phi(d) - \\phi(x)) = e \\left( V_s - V_s\\left(\\frac{x}{d}\\right)^{\\frac{4}{3}} \\right) = e V_s \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{x}{d}\\right)^{\\frac{4}{3}}\\right)$$\n\n3.  **Energy Loss for a Collision at Location $x$**\n    The loss in kinetic energy, $\\Delta K(x)$, for a collision occurring at location $x$ is the difference between the kinetic energy in the collisionless case and the kinetic energy in the collision case.\n    $$\\Delta K(x) = K_{\\text{no-collision}} - K_{\\text{collision}}(x)$$\n    $$\\Delta K(x) = e V_s - e V_s \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{x}{d}\\right)^{\\frac{4}{3}}\\right)$$\n    $$\\Delta K(x) = e V_s - e V_s + e V_s \\left(\\frac{x}{d}\\right)^{\\frac{4}{3}}$$\n    $$\\Delta K(x) = e V_s \\left(\\frac{x}{d}\\right)^{\\frac{4}{3}}$$\n    This result is intuitive: the energy lost is precisely the kinetic energy the ion would have gained from being accelerated from $x=0$ to $x$, which is $e(\\phi(x) - \\phi(0)) = e\\phi(x)$.\n\n4.  **Expected Energy Loss**\n    The problem states that the collision location $x$ is a random variable uniformly distributed on the interval $[0,d]$.

            "solution": "The solution proceeds by deriving the ion energy distribution function (IEDF) from first principles, as requested. The core assumptions are that ions are singly charged ($q=+e$), enter the sheath with negligible kinetic energy, and transit the sheath in a time $\\tau_i$ that is much shorter than the period of the radio-frequency (RF) field ($T = 2\\pi/\\omega$). This is the fast-ion regime, $\\omega\\tau_i \\ll 1$. Consequently, each ion accelerates across a quasi-static potential drop equal to the instantaneous sheath voltage at the moment it enters the sheath.\n\nThe sheath voltage relative to the plasma potential is given by $V_{s}(t)=V_{0}+V_{1}\\cos(\\omega t)$. An ion entering the sheath at time $t_0$ will arrive at the wafer with a kinetic energy $E$ given by the principle of energy conservation:\n$$E(t_0) = qV_{s}(t_0) = e\\left(V_{0}+V_{1}\\cos(\\omega t_0)\\right)$$\nThe energy of an arriving ion is thus a function of its entry time $t_0$. The range of possible energies is determined by the minimum and maximum of the sheath voltage.\nThe minimum energy is $E_{\\text{low}} = e(V_{0} - V_{1})$, occurring when $\\cos(\\omega t_0) = -1$.\nThe maximum energy is $E_{\\text{high}} = e(V_{0} + V_{1})$, occurring when $\\cos(\\omega t_0) = +1$.\nThe condition $V_1  V_0$ ensures that $E_{\\text{low}}  0$.\n\nTo find the ion energy distribution function, $f(E)$, we use the assumption that the ion flux at the sheath edge is constant in time. This implies that the probability of an ion entering the sheath in an interval $dt_0$ is uniform over one RF period $T=2\\pi/\\omega$. We can equivalently consider the entry phase $\\phi_0 = \\omega t_0$, which is uniformly distributed over the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$. The probability density for the entry phase is $p(\\phi_0) = 1/(2\\pi)$.\n\nThe IEDF $f(E)$ is related to the phase probability density $p(\\phi_0)$ by the change of variables formula:\n$$f(E) = \\sum_{i} p(\\phi_{0,i})\\left|\\frac{d\\phi_0}{dE}\\right|_{\\phi_0=\\phi_{0,i}}$$\nwhere the sum is over all phases $\\phi_{0,i}$ that yield the energy $E$.\nFrom the energy equation $E = e(V_{0}+V_{1}\\cos\\phi_0)$, we find the derivative:\n$$\\frac{dE}{d\\phi_0} = -eV_{1}\\sin\\phi_0$$\nThus, $\\left|\\frac{d\\phi_0}{dE}\\right| = \\frac{1}{e V_1 |\\sin\\phi_0|}$.\n\nTo express $|\\sin\\phi_0|$ in terms of $E$, we first write $\\cos\\phi_0 = \\frac{E - eV_0}{eV_1}$. Using the identity $\\sin^2\\phi_0 + \\cos^2\\phi_0 = 1$, we get:\n$$|\\sin\\phi_0| = \\sqrt{1 - \\cos^2\\phi_0} = \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{E - eV_0}{eV_1}\\right)^2}$$\nFor any energy $E$ such that $E_{\\text{low}}  E  E_{\\text{high}}$, there are two entry phases in $[0, 2\\pi)$ that correspond to this energy, one in $(0, \\pi)$ and one in $(\\pi, 2\\pi)$.

Higher peak energy: $E = E_{\\text{high}} = e(V_{0}+V_{1})$\n\nTo find the relative intensities of the two peaks, we analyze the structure of the IEDF. The function $f(E)$ is symmetric about the mean energy $\\bar{E} = eV_0$. Due to this symmetry, the distribution of ions is balanced between the lower-energy half of the spectrum ($E  eV_0$) and the higher-energy half ($E  eV_0$). The area under the IEDF for each half is identical:\n$$\\int_{E_{\\text{low}}}^{eV_0} f(E)dE = \\int_{eV_0}^{E_{\\text{high}}} f(E)dE = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThis implies that the total probability associated with the low-energy peak region is equal to that of the high-energy peak region. The problem asks for the relative intensity based on the normalized area in symmetric neighborhoods of the endpoints. Let's analyze the behavior of $f(E)$ near these endpoints.\nNear $E_{\\text{high}}$, let $E = E_{\\text{high}} - \\delta E$ with $\\delta E \\to 0^{+}$.\n$$f(E) \\approx \\frac{1}{\\pi\\sqrt{\\delta E (E_{\\text{high}}-E_{\\text{low}})}} = \\frac{1}{\\pi\\sqrt{2eV_1 \\delta E}}$$\nNear $E_{\\text{low}}$, let $E = E_{\\text{low}} + \\delta E$ with $\\delta E \\to 0^{+}$.\n$$f(E) \\approx \\frac{1}{\\pi\\sqrt{(E_{\\text{high}}-E_{\\text{low}}) \\delta E}} = \\frac{1}{\\pi\\sqrt{2eV_1 \\delta E}}$$\nThe functional form of the singularity is identical at both peaks. The area in a small neighborhood of width $\\epsilon$ is $\\int_0^\\epsilon f(E_{peak} \\pm \\delta E) d(\\delta E) \\propto \\int_0^\\epsilon \\frac{d(\\delta E)}{\\sqrt{\\delta E}} \\propto \\sqrt{\\epsilon}$.\nSince the constants of proportionality are identical, the areas in symmetric neighborhoods are equal. Therefore, the normalized relative intensities are equal.\n$$I_{\\text{low}} = I_{\\text{high}} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$$\n\nFinally, we evaluate the peak energies and intensities for the given numerical values: $V_0 = 220\\,\\text{V}$ and $V_1 = 80\\,\\text{V}$. The energies are expressed in electronvolts (eV), where the numerical value of energy in eV is equal to the numerical value of the accelerating potential in volts.\n\nLower peak energy:\n$$E_{\\text{low}} = V_0 - V_1 = 220 - 80 = 140\\,\\text{eV}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $E_{\\text{low}} = 140.0\\,\\text{eV}$.\n\nHigher peak energy:\n$$E_{\\text{high}} = V_0 + V_1 = 220 + 80 = 300\\,\\text{eV}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $E_{\\text{high}} = 300.0\\,\\text{eV}$.\n\nRelative intensities (normalized to sum to 1):\n$$I_{\\text{low}} = 0.5$$\n$$I_{\\text{high}} = 0.5$$\nTo four significant figures, $I_{\\text{low}} = 0.5000$ and $I_{\\text{high}} = 0.5000$.\n\nThe final answer is composed of these four values in the specified order.",
