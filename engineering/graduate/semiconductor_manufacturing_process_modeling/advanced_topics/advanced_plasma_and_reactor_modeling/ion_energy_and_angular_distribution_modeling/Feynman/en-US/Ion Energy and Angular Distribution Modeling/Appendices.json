A detailed solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation and Calculation**\n\nThe mean free path $\\lambda$ of a particle moving through a background of target particles is given by the formula from kinetic theory:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{1}{n \\sigma}\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the number density of the target particles and $\\sigma$ is the collision cross section. In this problem, the moving particles are argon ions and the target particles are neutral argon atoms. The relevant process is charge exchange. Thus, the ion charge-exchange mean free path $\\lambda_{cx}$ is:\n$$\n\\lambda_{cx} = \\frac{1}{n_g \\sigma_{cx}}\n$$\nwhere $n_g$ is the number density of the neutral argon gas and $\\sigma_{cx}$ is the charge-exchange cross section.\n\nThe problem states that the neutral gas obeys the ideal gas law, $pV = Nk_BT$, where $p$ is the pressure, $V$ is the volume, $N$ is the number of particles, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature. The number density $n_g$ is defined as $N/V$. Rearranging the ideal gas law gives:\n$$\nn_g = \\frac{N}{V} = \\frac{p}{k_B T_g}\n$$\nwhere $T_g$ is the temperature of the neutral gas.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $n_g$ into the equation for $\\lambda_{cx}$, we obtain the desired expression for the ion charge-exchange mean free path in terms of the given parameters:\n$$\n\\lambda_{cx} = \\frac{k_B T_g}{p \\sigma_{cx}}\n$$\nThis is the symbolic expression for the mean free path.\n\nNext, we evaluate $\\lambda_{cx}$ numerically using the provided values. All parameters must be in base SI units.\n- The Boltzmann constant is $k_B \\approx 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K}$.\n- The gas temperature is $T_g = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n- The cross section is $\\sigma_{cx} = 2 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$.\n- The pressure $p = 20\\,\\mathrm{mTorr}$ must be converted to Pascals ($\\mathrm{Pa}$, or $\\mathrm{N/m^2}$).

Therefore, the sheath is considered **collisionless**. An ion traversing the sheath is, on average, very unlikely to undergo a collision with a neutral atom.\n\nThe impact on the Ion Energy Distribution Function (IEDF) and Ion Angular Distribution Function (IADF) at the wafer surface is significant:\n\n- **IEDF in a collisionless sheath:** Ions are accelerated across the sheath potential drop without losing energy to collisions. If ions enter the sheath with low thermal energy, they will all gain approximately the same amount of energy, equal to the total potential drop across the sheath. This results in an IEDF at the wafer that is narrow and peaked at a high energy. For an RF sheath, this typically manifests as a bimodal distribution with two sharp peaks, corresponding to ions traversing the sheath when the sheath potential is at its minimum and maximum during the RF cycle.\n\n- **IADF in a collisionless sheath:** The electric field in the sheath is predominantly directed normal to the wafer surface. In the absence of randomizing collisions, the strong electric field accelerates the ions, aligning their velocity vectors almost perfectly with the field lines. Consequently, the ions strike the wafer surface at near-normal incidence. This results in an IADF that is highly anisotropic, with a sharp peak centered at an angle of $0^\\circ$ relative to the surface normal.\n\nIn contrast, a collisional sheath ($K_n \\ll 1$) would lead to a broad IEDF extending to low energies (due to ions being created within the sheath via charge exchange) and a broad, less-anisotropic IADF (due to collisional scattering). The high value of $K_n$ in this problem predicts the narrow distributions characteristic of high-anisotropy etching processes.",

            "introduction": "In a low-pressure, collisionless sheath, ions are accelerated to the wafer with high energy and directionality, ideal for anisotropic etching. This acceleration is a two-part process, beginning with a subtle push in the quasi-neutral presheath before the dramatic fall across the main sheath potential.

Round your numeric answer to three significant figures and express the fraction as a pure number (dimensionless). Finally, based on your derivation, explain under what condition $F_{\\mathrm{ps}}$ is negligible and why, using only the fundamental starting assumptions stated above.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a standard, albeit simplified, model of ion acceleration in a low-pressure plasma, a core topic in semiconductor process modeling. The assumptions provided are standard and sufficient for deriving a unique solution.\n\nThe problem asks for three components: a derivation of the fraction $F_{\\mathrm{ps}}$ of total ion energy gained in the presheath, a numerical evaluation of this fraction, and an explanation of the condition under which this fraction is negligible.\n\nWe begin by defining the energy components. Let $E_{\\mathrm{ps}}$ be the kinetic energy an ion gains traversing the presheath, and let $E_{\\mathrm{sh}}$ be the kinetic energy it gains traversing the collisionless sheath. The total ion impact energy on the substrate is the sum of these two contributions, assuming the ion has negligible thermal energy in the bulk plasma where it originates.\n$$E_{\\mathrm{impact}} = E_{\\mathrm{ps}} + E_{\\mathrm{sh}}$$\nThe fraction of the total energy attributable to presheath acceleration is defined as:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{ps}} = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{ps}}}{E_{\\mathrm{impact}}} = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{ps}}}{E_{\\mathrm{ps}} + E_{\\mathrm{sh}}}$$\n\nFirst, we determine $E_{\\mathrm{ps}}$. The problem states that ions are accelerated in the presheath to the Bohm speed, $v_B$, by the time they reach the sheath edge. The Bohm criterion for a stable sheath with cold ions and isothermal Maxwellian electrons dictates that the ion velocity must be at least the ion sound speed, $c_s$. Using the minimum speed gives:\n$$v_B = c_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T_e}{m_i}}$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T_e$ is the electron temperature in Kelvin, and $m_i$ is the ion mass.\nThe kinetic energy of an ion at the sheath edge is therefore:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{ps}} = \\frac{1}{2} m_i v_B^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m_i \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T_e}{m_i}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} k_B T_e$$\nThis is the energy gained in the presheath.\n\nNext, we determine $E_{\\mathrm{sh}}$. The ion, having entered the sheath with energy $E_{\\mathrm{ps}}$, is then accelerated by the potential drop across the sheath. The problem specifies that the sheath is collisionless and the potential drop equals the substrate bias, $V_b$, relative to the plasma potential. For a singly charged ion with charge $e$, the potential energy lost when falling through a potential $V_b$ is converted into kinetic energy.\n$$E_{\\mathrm{sh}} = e V_b$$\nThis is the additional kinetic energy gained in the sheath.\n\nNow we can construct the fraction $F_{\\mathrm{ps}}$:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{ps}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} k_B T_e}{\\frac{1}{2} k_B T_e + e V_b}$$\nThe problem provides a convenient convention: $T_e$ is given in units of electronvolts (eV) and $V_b$ is given in volts (V). Let the value of the electron temperature in eV be denoted by $T_{e, \\mathrm{eV}}$ and the value of the bias in volts be $V_{b, \\mathrm{V}}$. The relationship between temperature in Kelvin and in eV is $k_B T_e = e T_{e, \\mathrm{eV}}$. Substituting this into the equation for the fraction:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{ps}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} e T_{e, \\mathrm{eV}}}{\\frac{1}{2} e T_{e, \\mathrm{eV}} + e V_{b, \\mathrm{V}}}$$\nThe elementary charge $e$ cancels, yielding a dimensionless fraction:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{ps}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} T_{e, \\mathrm{eV}}}{\\frac{1}{2} T_{e, \\mathrm{eV}} + V_{b, \\mathrm{V}}}$$\nFollowing the problem's notation to use $T_e$ for the value in eV and $V_b$ for the value in V, the final expression is:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{ps}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} T_e}{\\frac{1}{2} T_e + V_b} = \\frac{T_e}{T_e + 2 V_b}$$\n\nNext, we evaluate this fraction for the given values, $T_e = 3.5$ eV and $V_b = 150$ V.\n$$F_{\\mathrm{ps}} = \\frac{3.5}{3.5 + 2(150)} = \\frac{3.5}{3.5 + 300} = \\frac{3.5}{303.5}$$\n$$F_{\\mathrm{ps}} \\approx 0.011532125...$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the numerical value is $0.0115$.\n\nFinally, we analyze the condition under which $F_{\\mathrm{ps}}$ is negligible. The derived expression is:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{ps}} = \\frac{T_e}{T_e + 2 V_b}$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{ps}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{2 V_b}{T_e}}$$\nFor $F_{\\mathrm{ps}}$ to be negligible, we require $F_{\\mathrm{ps}} \\ll 1$. This condition is met when the denominator is much larger than the numerator. From the second form of the expression, this means:\n$$1 + \\frac{2 V_b}{T_e} \\gg 1 \\implies \\frac{2 V_b}{T_e} \\gg 1 \\implies V_b \\gg \\frac{T_e}{2}$$\nThe physical interpretation of this condition is straightforward. The energy gained in the presheath is $E_{\\mathrm{ps}} = \\frac{1}{2} k_B T_e$, which corresponds to an energy of $\\frac{1}{2} T_e$ in units of eV. The energy gained in the sheath is $E_{\\mathrm{sh}} = e V_b$, which corresponds to an energy of $V_b$ in units of eV. The condition $V_b \\gg \\frac{T_e}{2}$ states that the numerical value of the sheath voltage must be much larger than half the numerical value of the electron temperature in eV. This is equivalent to the condition that the energy gained by the ion in the sheath, $E_{\\mathrm{sh}}$, is much greater than the energy it gained in the presheath, $E_{\\mathrm{ps}}$. When $E_{\\mathrm{sh}} \\gg E_{\\mathrm{ps}}$, the total impact energy is dominated by the sheath acceleration, $E_{\\mathrm{impact}} = E_{\\mathrm{ps}} + E_{\\mathrm{sh}} \\approx E_{\\mathrm{sh}}$. Consequently, the fraction contributed by the presheath, $F_{\\mathrm{ps}} = E_{\\mathrm{ps}}/E_{\\mathrm{impact}}$, becomes very small. This is a common regime in high-density plasma etching reactors where a large DC self-bias ($V_b$ of hundreds of volts) is applied to the substrate to achieve highly anisotropic etching, while the electron temperature ($T_e$) remains on the order of a few electronvolts.",

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem asks for the mean ion exit kinetic energy at the electrode. This requires finding the exit kinetic energy as a function of the collision position, and then averaging this energy over the specified distribution of collision positions.\n\nFirst, we determine the electric potential profile $V(x)$ within the sheath, for $x \\in [0,s]$. The problem states that the potential varies linearly with position $x$. We can express a linear function as $V(x) = ax + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants. The boundary conditions are given as $V(0) = V_s$ and $V(s) = 0$.\nUsing the first condition at $x=0$:\n$$V(0) = a(0) + b = V_s \\implies b = V_s$$\nUsing the second condition at $x=s$:\n$$V(s) = as + V_s = 0 \\implies a = -\\frac{V_s}{s}$$\nTherefore, the potential profile is:\n$$V(x) = -\\frac{V_s}{s}x + V_s = V_s \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{s}\\right)$$\nThis linear potential corresponds to a uniform electric field $E = -\\frac{dV}{dx} = \\frac{V_s}{s}$, which is consistent with the problem's stated assumptions.\n\nNext, we determine the kinetic energy, $K_{exit}$, of an ion at the electrode ($x=s$). The scenario is that a singly charged positive ion (charge $e$) is created at a random position $x$ within the sheath with negligible initial kinetic energy. This new ion is then accelerated by the electric field until it strikes the electrode at $x=s$.\nAccording to the work-energy theorem, the kinetic energy gained by a charge $q$ moving from a point with potential $V_a$ to a point with potential $V_b$ is $q(V_a - V_b)$.\nFor our ion, the charge is $q=e$. The initial position is the collision location $x$, where the potential is $V(x)$. The final position is the electrode at $s$, where the potential is $V(s)$. The initial kinetic energy is assumed to be zero.\nLet $K(x)$ be the final kinetic energy of an ion created at position $x$.\n$$K(x) - 0 = e(V(x) - V(s))$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the potential:\n$$K(x) = e \\left( V_s \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{s}\\right) - 0 \\right) = e V_s \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{s}\\right)$$\nThis expression gives the exit kinetic energy of an ion as a function of its creation position $x$.\n\nThe problem states that the collision position $x$ is a random variable that is uniformly distributed in the interval $[0,s]$. The probability density function (PDF) for a uniform distribution on $[0,s]$ is given by $p(x)$, where:\n$$ p(x) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{s} & \\text{if } 0 \\le x \\le s \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} $$\nThe mean ion exit kinetic energy, denoted by $\\langle K \\rangle$, is the expected value of $K(x)$ with respect to this distribution. The expected value is calculated by integrating the product of the function $K(x)$ and the PDF $p(x)$ over all possible values of $x$.\n$$\\langle K \\rangle = E[K(x)] = \\int_{0}^{s} K(x)p(x)dx$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $K(x)$ and $p(x)$:\n$$\\langle K \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{s} \\left( e V_s \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{s}\\right) \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{s} \\right) dx$$\nWe can factor out the constants from the integral:\n$$\\langle K \\rangle = \\frac{e V_s}{s} \\int_{0}^{s} \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{s}\\right) dx$$\nNow, we perform the integration:\n$$\\int_{0}^{s} \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{s}\\right) dx = \\left[ x - \\frac{x^2}{2s} \\right]_{0}^{s}$$\nEvaluating the integral at the limits of integration:\n$$= \\left( s - \\frac{s^2}{2s} \\right) - \\left( 0 - \\frac{0^2}{2s} \\right)$$\n$$= \\left( s - \\frac{s}{2} \\right) - 0$$\n$$= \\frac{s}{2}$$\nFinally, we substitute this result back into the expression for $\\langle K \\rangle$:\n$$\\langle K \\rangle = \\frac{e V_s}{s} \\left( \\frac{s}{2} \\right)$$\n$$\\langle K \\rangle = \\frac{e V_s}{2}$$\nThis expression is in terms of the given parameters $e$ and $V_s$.
