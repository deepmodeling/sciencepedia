Within the regime of low-energy sputtering of metals, assume the following idealized threshold condition: sputtering begins when, in the most favorable near-surface head-on binary elastic collision, the energy transferred to a single target atom suffices to overcome the aluminum surface binding energy $U_{s}=3.4$ electron volt (eV). \n\nStarting from the fundamental laws of conservation of linear momentum and kinetic energy for a one-dimensional elastic collision in which the target atom is initially at rest, derive the maximum fraction of the projectile ion’s kinetic energy that can be transferred to a single target atom.

            "solution": "The problem has been validated and is deemed sound. It is a well-posed physics problem based on fundamental principles of mechanics applied to a materials science context. All necessary information is provided, and the problem is free of scientific inaccuracies or ambiguities.\n\nThe problem asks for two main derivations and one calculation based on an idealized model of sputtering.\n\nFirst, we derive the maximum fraction of a projectile's kinetic energy that can be transferred to a stationary target atom in a one-dimensional, head-on elastic collision. Let the projectile ion have mass $M_1$ and initial velocity $v_1$. Its initial kinetic energy is $E_1 = \\frac{1}{2}M_1 v_1^2$. The target atom has mass $M_2$ and is initially at rest, so its initial velocity is $v_2 = 0$. After the collision, their respective velocities are $v_1'$ and $v_2'$.\n\nThe collision is elastic, so both linear momentum and kinetic energy are conserved.\n\n1.  Conservation of linear momentum:\n    $$M_1 v_1 + M_2 v_2 = M_1 v_1' + M_2 v_2'$$\n    Since $v_2 = 0$, the equation simplifies to:\n    $$M_1 v_1 = M_1 v_1' + M_2 v_2' \\quad (1)$$\n\n2.  Conservation of kinetic energy:\n    $$\\frac{1}{2}M_1 v_1^2 + \\frac{1}{2}M_2 v_2^2 = \\frac{1}{2}M_1 (v_1')^2 + \\frac{1}{2}M_2 (v_2')^2$$\n    Since $v_2 = 0$, and canceling the $\\frac{1}{2}$ factor:\n    $$M_1 v_1^2 = M_1 (v_1')^2 + M_2 (v_2')^2 \\quad (2)$$\n\nWe can rearrange these two equations to solve for $v_2'$ in terms of $v_1$. From equation (1):\n$$M_1 (v_1 - v_1') = M_2 v_2' \\quad (3)$$\nFrom equation (2):\n$$M_1 (v_1^2 - (v_1')^2) = M_2 (v_2')^2$$\n$$M_1 (v_1 - v_1')(v_1 + v_1') = M_2 (v_2')^2 \\quad (4)$$\nSubstituting equation (3) into equation (4):\n$$(M_2 v_2')(v_1 + v_1') = M_2 (v_2')^2$$\nFor a non-trivial collision where energy is transferred, $v_2' \\neq 0$. We can thus divide both sides by $M_2 v_2'$:\n$$v_1 + v_1' = v_2' \\Rightarrow v_1' = v_2' - v_1$$\nNow substitute this expression for $v_1'$ back into the momentum conservation equation (1):\n$$M_1 v_1 = M_1 (v_2' - v_1) + M_2 v_2'$$\n$$M_1 v_1 = M_1 v_2' - M_1 v_1 + M_2 v_2'$$\n$$2 M_1 v_1 = (M_1 + M_2) v_2'$$\nSolving for the final velocity of the target atom, $v_2'$:\n$$v_2' = \\left( \\frac{2 M_1}{M_1 + M_2} \\right) v_1$$\n\nThe kinetic energy transferred to the target atom, which we denote as $\\Delta E$, is the final kinetic energy of the target:\n$$\\Delta E = \\frac{1}{2} M_2 (v_2')^2 = \\frac{1}{2} M_2 \\left( \\frac{2 M_1}{M_1 + M_2} v_1 \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} M_2 \\frac{4 M_1^2}{(M_1 + M_2)^2} v_1^2$$\nThe initial kinetic energy of the projectile is $E_1 = \\frac{1}{2} M_1 v_1^2$. The fraction of energy transferred is the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta E}{E_1}$:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta E}{E_1} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} M_2 \\frac{4 M_1^2}{(M_1 + M_2)^2} v_1^2}{\\frac{1}{2} M_1 v_1^2} = \\frac{4 M_1 M_2}{(M_1 + M_2)^2}$$\nThis dimensionless quantity, often denoted $\\gamma$, is the maximum fractional energy transfer, which occurs in a head-on elastic collision.\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{4 M_1 M_2}{(M_1 + M_2)^2}$$\n\nNext, we compute the threshold ion energy, $E_{\\mathrm{th}}$. The problem states that sputtering begins when the transferred energy $\\Delta E$ is equal to the surface binding energy $U_s$. At the threshold, the incident ion energy is $E_1 = E_{\\mathrm{th}}$.\nThe condition is:\n$$\\Delta E = U_s$$\nUsing the energy transfer relation $\\Delta E = \\gamma E_1$:\n$$U_s = \\gamma E_{\\mathrm{th}} = \\frac{4 M_1 M_2}{(M_1 + M_2)^2} E_{\\mathrm{th}}$$\nSolving for the threshold energy $E_{\\mathrm{th}}$ yields:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{th}} = \\frac{(M_1 + M_2)^2}{4 M_1 M_2} U_s$$\n\nNow we substitute the given values: $M_1=40 \\text{ u}$, $M_2=27 \\text{ u}$, and $U_s=3.4 \\text{ eV}$. The mass units cancel out in the ratio.\n$$E_{\\mathrm{th}} = \\frac{(40 + 27)^2}{4 \\times 40 \\times 27} \\times (3.4 \\text{ eV})$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{th}} = \\frac{67^2}{4320} \\times (3.4 \\text{ eV})$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{th}} = \\frac{4489}{4320} \\times (3.4 \\text{ eV})$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{th}} \\approx 1.039120... \\times (3.4 \\text{ eV})$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{th}} \\approx 3.532909... \\text{ eV}$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{th}} \\approx 3.533 \\text{ eV}$$\n\nFinally, we assess the reasonableness of this result. The calculated threshold energy of $3.533 \\text{ eV}$ is significantly lower than experimentally observed sputtering thresholds for $\\mathrm{Ar}^{+}$ on Al, which are typically in the range of $10 \\text{ eV}$ to $20 \\text{ eV}$ (commonly cited as $\\approx 13 \\text{ eV}$).\n\nThe discrepancy arises because the model is highly idealized and represents a theoretical best-case scenario for energy transfer. Its unreasonableness as a predictor for experimental values stems from several factors:\n1.  **Collision Geometry**: The model assumes a perfect, one-dimensional head-on collision. This specific geometry transfers the maximum possible energy. In reality, incident ions strike the surface at various angles and impact parameters, leading to a wide distribution of scattering angles. Most collisions are not head-on and thus transfer significantly less energy to a single surface atom.\n2.  **Energy Dissipation Channels**: The model assumes that $100\\%$ of the transferred kinetic energy is available to overcome the surface binding potential. In a real solid, the impinging ion and the recoiling target atom dissipate energy through multiple channels. The impact initiates a collision cascade, where energy is shared among many atoms. A large fraction of the energy is also lost to inelastic processes, such as electronic excitations and the creation of phonons (lattice vibrations), which essentially translates to heat and does not contribute to the ejection of an atom.\n3.  **Surface Binding Model**: The surface binding energy $U_s$ (which is related to the heat of sublimation) is a macroscopic, averaged quantity. The actual energy barrier for an individual atom to escape depends on its local coordination and position on the surface (e.g., an atom on a terrace is more tightly bound than an adatom). The model simplifies this complex, many-body interaction into a single potential barrier for one atom.\n\nIn conclusion, the calculated value of $3.533 \\text{ eV}$ represents a fundamental lower limit based on two-body collision physics. It is not a realistic prediction of the measured sputtering threshold. The much higher experimental values reflect the inherent inefficiencies of the sputtering process, where only a small fraction of the projectile's initial energy is ever successfully converted into the kinetic energy needed to eject a surface atom against its binding forces. The model is valuable for establishing a theoretical baseline but inadequate for quantitative prediction without accounting for the statistical nature of collision cascades and energy loss mechanisms.",

            "solution": "The problem is to derive and solve the differential equation for the surface atomic fraction of species $A$, denoted $c_A(t)$, in a binary alloy target under ion bombardment. The derivation will be based on the principle of conservation of atoms in the topmost surface layer.\n\nLet $c_A(t)$ be the atomic fraction of species $A$ in the top layer at time $t$, and $c_B(t) = 1 - c_A(t)$ be that of species $B$. The total areal density of atoms in this layer, $n_s$, is constant. The number of atoms of species $A$ per unit area in the top layer is $N_A(t) = n_s c_A(t)$. The rate of change of this quantity is given by the balance between the rate of gain from the underlying bulk and the rate of loss due to sputtering.\n\n$$\n\\frac{dN_A(t)}{dt} = (\\text{Rate of gain of A}) - (\\text{Rate of loss of A})\n$$\n\nSince $n_s$ is a constant, we can write this in terms of the concentration $c_A(t)$:\n$$\nn_s \\frac{dc_A(t)}{dt} = (\\text{Rate of gain of A}) - (\\text{Rate of loss of A})\n$$\n\nWe now derive the expressions for the gain and loss terms.\n\n1.  **Rate of Loss of Species A by Sputtering:**\n    The ion flux is $\\Phi$ (ions $\\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-2} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$). The sputtering yield $Y_A$ represents the number of atoms of species $A$ ejected per incident ion, assuming a pure target of $A$. In a mixed target, the probability of an incident ion striking an atom of species $A$ is proportional to its surface fraction, $c_A(t)$. Therefore, the rate of removal of species $A$ atoms from the surface, per unit area, is:\n    $$\n    \\text{Rate of loss of A} = \\Phi \\cdot Y_A \\cdot c_A(t)\n    $$\n    Similarly, for species $B$:\n    $$\n    \\text{Rate of loss of B} = \\Phi \\cdot Y_B \\cdot c_B(t) = \\Phi \\cdot Y_B \\cdot (1 - c_A(t))\n    $$\n\n2.  **Rate of Gain of Species A by Surface Recession:**\n    Sputtering erodes the surface, exposing atoms from the layer below, which has the fixed bulk composition. The total rate at which atoms are removed from the surface (per unit area) is the sum of the loss rates for $A$ and $B$:\n    $$\n    \\text{Total atom loss rate} = (\\text{Rate of loss of A}) + (\\text{Rate of loss of B}) = \\Phi [Y_A c_A(t) + Y_B (1 - c_A(t))]\n    $$\n    To maintain a constant number of atoms $n_s$ in the topmost layer, for every atom sputtered away, one atom from the bulk must be exposed and effectively join the top layer. Thus, the rate at which atoms are gained by the top layer from the bulk is equal to the total atom loss rate. These newly exposed atoms have the bulk composition, where the fraction of species $A$ is $c_A^{\\mathrm{bulk}}$. The rate of gain of species $A$ atoms is therefore:\n    $$\n    \\text{Rate of gain of A} = (\\text{Total atom loss rate}) \\times c_A^{\\mathrm{bulk}}\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\text{Rate of gain of A} = \\Phi [Y_A c_A(t) + Y_B (1 - c_A(t))] c_A^{\\mathrm{bulk}}\n    $$\n\n3.  **Formulating the Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE):**\n    Substituting the loss and gain terms into the conservation equation:\n    $$\n    n_s \\frac{dc_A(t)}{dt} = \\Phi [Y_A c_A(t) + Y_B (1 - c_A(t))] c_A^{\\mathrm{bulk}} - \\Phi Y_A c_A(t)\n    $$\n    We can rearrange this equation by grouping terms with $c_A(t)$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{dc_A}{dt} = \\frac{\\Phi}{n_s} \\left( [Y_A c_A + Y_B - Y_B c_A] c_A^{\\mathrm{bulk}} - Y_A c_A \\right)\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\frac{dc_A}{dt} = \\frac{\\Phi}{n_s} \\left( c_A (Y_A - Y_B) c_A^{\\mathrm{bulk}} + Y_B c_A^{\\mathrm{bulk}} - Y_A c_A \\right)\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\frac{dc_A}{dt} = \\frac{\\Phi}{n_s} \\left( c_A [ (Y_A - Y_B)c_A^{\\mathrm{bulk}} - Y_A ] + Y_B c_A^{\\mathrm{bulk}} \\right)\n    $$\n    This is a first-order linear ODE of the form $\\frac{dy}{dt} = ay+b$.

Separating variables and integrating from $c_A(0)$ at $t=0$ to $c_A(t)$ at time $t$:\n    $$\n    \\int_{c_A(0)}^{c_A(t)} \\frac{dc_A'}{c_A' - c_A^{ss}} = -\\int_0^t \\frac{dt'}{\\tau}\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\ln\\left( \\frac{c_A(t) - c_A^{ss}}{c_A(0) - c_A^{ss}} \\right) = -\\frac{t}{\\tau}\n    $$\n    Solving for $c_A(t)$:\n    $$\n    c_A(t) - c_A^{ss} = (c_A(0) - c_A^{ss}) e^{-t/\\tau}\n    $$\n    $$\n    c_A(t) = c_A^{ss} + (c_A(0) - c_A^{ss}) e^{-t/\\tau}\n    $$\n    This is the final expression for the time evolution of the surface concentration.\n\n5.  **Special Cases:**\n    - If $\\Phi = 0$, there is no sputtering, and the surface composition should not change. Our formula for $\\tau$ would involve division by zero. By physical reasoning, if $\\Phi=0$, then $\\frac{dc_A}{dt} = 0$, so $c_A(t) = c_A(0)$ for all $t$. The implementation must handle this case separately.\n    - If the denominator $D = Y_A (1 - c_A^{\\mathrm{bulk}}) + Y_B c_A^{\\mathrm{bulk}} = 0$ (and $\\Phi > 0$), it means the bulk-composition-weighted sputtering yield is zero. This situation implies $\\frac{dc_A}{dt} = 0$ as well, since both terms in the ODE would be zero (as $D=0$ with non-negative yields requires either $Y_A=0$ and $c_B^{\\mathrm{bulk}} = 0$ or $Y_B=0$ and $c_A^{\\mathrm{bulk}}=0$ or both yields are zero). In this case too, $c_A(t) = c_A(0)$. This is handled by checking if the denominator is zero.\n\nThe program will implement the final analytical solution, including the conditional logic for the special cases identified.",

Since the sputtering yield is a highly non-linear function of energy, simply calculating the yield at the average ion energy is often inaccurate. This computational practice challenges you to model a more realistic scenario by averaging a sophisticated yield function over a measured ion energy distribution, highlighting the critical impact of energy spread on the overall process efficiency .",

            "problem": "Consider a Radio Frequency (RF) sputtering process in which singly charged argon ions impinge on a metallic or semiconductor target. The sputtering yield, defined as the number of target atoms ejected per incident ion, depends on the ion kinetic energy and exhibits a threshold behavior. Let the energy of an incident ion be denoted by $E$ (in electronvolts, eV) and let the sputtering yield be modeled by a semi-empirical Sigmund-like form grounded in nuclear stopping, with threshold enforcement:\n$$\nY(E) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\kappa \\,\\ln\\!\\big(1 + \\beta E\\big)\\,\\left[\\,1 - \\left(\\dfrac{E_{\\mathrm{th}}}{E}\\right)^{\\gamma}\\right],  E > E_{\\mathrm{th}} \\\\[6pt]\n0,  E \\le E_{\\mathrm{th}}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis model reflects that, above the threshold energy $E_{\\mathrm{th}}$, the yield grows with energy via a slowly varying nuclear stopping proxy $\\ln(1+\\beta E)$ and is reduced near threshold by the factor $\\left[1 - \\left(E_{\\mathrm{th}}/E\\right)^{\\gamma}\\right]$. The parameters $\\kappa$, $\\beta$, $E_{\\mathrm{th}}$, and $\\gamma$ depend on the ion-target pair and the surface binding environment but are fixed for a given case.\n\nIn RF sputtering, the energy distribution of ions arriving at the target is broadened by sheath modulation. Let $f(E)$ denote the measured ion energy Probability Density Function (PDF), taken here as a mixture of normal components truncated to $E \\ge 0$:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{raw}}(E) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i\\,\\frac{1}{\\sigma_i \\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(E - \\mu_i)^2}{2\\sigma_i^2}\\right), \\quad E \\ge 0,\n$$\nwith weights $\\{w_i\\}$, means $\\{\\mu_i\\}$ (in eV), and standard deviations $\\{\\sigma_i\\}$ (in eV). The physically admissible PDF is the normalized truncation\n$$\nf(E) = \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{raw}}(E)}{\\int_{0}^{\\infty} f_{\\mathrm{raw}}(u)\\,du}, \\quad E \\ge 0.\n$$\n\nStarting from the definitions of expectation and the above physically motivated yield model, your task is to derive and implement a numerical procedure to compute:\n1. The mean energy\n$$\n\\bar{E} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} E\\, f(E)\\, dE \\quad \\text{(in eV)}.\n$$\n2. The average sputtering yield\n$$\n\\bar{Y} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} Y(E)\\, f(E)\\, dE \\quad \\text{(dimensionless)}.\n$$\n3. The yield evaluated at the mean energy $Y(\\bar{E})$.\n4. A nonlinearity metric\n$$\n\\Delta = \\bar{Y} - Y(\\bar{E}) \\quad \\text{(dimensionless)},\n$$\nwhich quantifies the deviation arising from the nonlinearity of $Y(E)$ across the energy spread.\n\nExpress all energies in electronvolts (eV). The sputtering yields $Y(E)$, $\\bar{Y}$, $Y(\\bar{E})$, and $\\Delta$ are dimensionless. The angle unit is not applicable. You must compute numerical integrals by direct quadrature over a finite energy interval $[0, E_{\\max}]$ with $E_{\\max}$ chosen sufficiently large such that the contribution of $f(E)$ beyond $E_{\\max}$ is negligible. Use a uniform energy grid with sufficiently fine resolution to ensure numerical stability and accuracy. Your program must renormalize $f_{\\mathrm{raw}}(E)$ so that $\\int_0^{\\infty} f(E)\\,dE = 1$.\n\nTest Suite:\nImplement your solution for the following three scientifically plausible cases. For each case, use the specified model parameters $(\\kappa, \\beta, E_{\\mathrm{th}}, \\gamma)$ and truncated normal mixture for $f_{\\mathrm{raw}}(E)$.\n\n- Case $1$ (Argon on copper-like target):\n  - Yield model parameters: $\\kappa = 0.50$, $\\beta = 0.030\\,\\mathrm{eV}^{-1}$, $E_{\\mathrm{th}} = 25\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, $\\gamma = 2.0$.\n  - Measured $f_{\\mathrm{raw}}(E)$ mixture (weights, means, standard deviations):\n    - Component $1$: $w_1 = 0.50$, $\\mu_1 = 30\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, $\\sigma_1 = 8\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n    - Component $2$: $w_2 = 0.35$, $\\mu_2 = 120\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, $\\sigma_2 = 30\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n    - Component $3$: $w_3 = 0.15$, $\\mu_3 = 250\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, $\\sigma_3 = 50\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n\n- Case $2$ (Argon on silicon-like target, narrow distribution):\n  - Yield model parameters: $\\kappa = 0.30$, $\\beta = 0.025\\,\\mathrm{eV}^{-1}$, $E_{\\mathrm{th}} = 18\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, $\\gamma = 2.0$.\n  - Measured $f_{\\mathrm{raw}}(E)$ mixture:\n    - Component $1$: $w_1 = 1.00$, $\\mu_1 = 100\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, $\\sigma_1 = 2\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n\n- Case $3$ (Argon on tantalum-like target, substantial near-threshold content):\n  - Yield model parameters: $\\kappa = 0.28$, $\\beta = 0.020\\,\\mathrm{eV}^{-1}$, $E_{\\mathrm{th}} = 40\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, $\\gamma = 2.5$.\n  - Measured $f_{\\mathrm{raw}}(E)$ mixture:\n    - Component $1$: $w_1 = 0.70$, $\\mu_1 = 28\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, $\\sigma_1 = 6\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n    - Component $2$: $w_2 = 0.30$, $\\mu_2 = 60\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, $\\sigma_2 = 15\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n\nComputational Specifications:\n- Use $E_{\\max} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and a uniform grid on $[0, E_{\\max}]$ with at least $50000$ points.\n- Numerically normalize $f_{\\mathrm{raw}}(E)$ over $[0, E_{\\max}]$ to obtain $f(E)$.\n- Compute $\\bar{E}$, $\\bar{Y}$, $Y(\\bar{E})$, and $\\Delta$ per the definitions above.\n\nFinal Output Format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list of three sublists, one per case, each sublist containing the three floating-point values $[\\bar{Y}, Y(\\bar{E}), \\Delta]$ in that order. The entire line must be enclosed in square brackets. For example,\n$[[y_1, y_2, y_3],[y_4, y_5, y_6],[y_7, y_8, y_9]]$\nwhere each $y_j$ is a floating-point number.

The Sigmund model for sputtering yield, including a threshold energy, is a standard and physically motivated semi-empirical model. The representation of the ion energy distribution as a sum of normal distributions is a common and valid approximation for RF plasma sheaths. The parameters provided are physically plausible for typical sputtering processes (e.g., argon ions on metal or semiconductor targets).\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. The functions $Y(E)$ and $f(E)$ are clearly defined. The task is to compute definite integrals and derived quantities, for which a unique solution exists for each set of parameters. The computational specifications provide a clear path to a stable numerical solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem statement is entirely objective, quantitative, and free of subjective or ambiguous language.\n- **Flaw Analysis**: The problem exhibits none of the disqualifying flaws. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, feasible, and well-structured. The specified integration limit $E_{\\max} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ is physically justified, as the normal distribution tails for the highest-energy components (e.g., Case 1, component 3 with $\\mu_3 = 250\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and $\\sigma_3 = 50\\,\\mathrm{eV}$) become negligible far below this limit. The problem is a non-trivial application of numerical methods to a standard model in materials processing.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be developed.\n\n---\n\n### Principle-Based Solution Design\n\nThe core task is to compute expectations of functions of energy, $\\langle g(E) \\rangle = \\int_0^\\infty g(E) f(E) dE$, where $f(E)$ is an ion energy probability density function (PDF). Since analytical integration of the resulting expressions is intractable, a numerical approach based on discretization and quadrature is required.\n\n**1. Discretization of the Energy Domain**\nThe continuous energy variable $E$ is discretized over the specified finite interval $[0, E_{\\max}]$. We define a uniform energy grid of $N$ points, where $N \\ge 50000$. Let the grid points be $E_j = j \\cdot \\Delta E$ for $j = 0, 1, \\dots, N-1$, with the energy step $\\Delta E = E_{\\max} / (N-1)$. The use of $E_{\\max} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ is a valid approximation for $\\int_0^\\infty$ because the given PDFs $f(E)$ decay to numerically insignificant values far below this energy.\n\n**2. Construction of the Ion Energy PDF, $f(E)$**\nFirst, we evaluate the unnormalized distribution, $f_{\\mathrm{raw}}(E)$, at each point $E_j$ on the grid. For a given test case with $M$ components, this is:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{raw}}(E_j) = \\sum_{i=1}^{M} w_i\\,\\frac{1}{\\sigma_i \\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(E_j - \\mu_i)^2}{2\\sigma_i^2}\\right)\n$$\nNext, we must normalize this distribution. The problem specifies numerical normalization over the interval $[0, E_{\\max}]$. The normalization constant, $C$, is the numerical integral of $f_{\\mathrm{raw}}(E)$:\n$$\nC = \\int_{0}^{E_{\\max}} f_{\\mathrm{raw}}(u)\\,du\n$$\nThis integral is computed using a standard quadrature method, such as the trapezoidal rule, which is well-suited for a finely sampled grid.\n$$\nC \\approx \\sum_{j=1}^{N-1} \\frac{1}{2} (f_{\\mathrm{raw}}(E_j) + f_{\\mathrm{raw}}(E_{j-1})) (E_j - E_{j-1})\n$$\nThe normalized PDF at each grid point is then calculated as:\n$$\nf(E_j) = \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{raw}}(E_j)}{C}\n$$\nBy construction, the numerical integral of the resulting $f(E_j)$ over the grid will be equal to $1$.\n\n**3. Sputtering Yield Function, $Y(E)$**\nThe sputtering yield function $Y(E)$ is evaluated at each energy grid point $E_j$. Its piecewise definition is handled directly:\n$$\nY(E_j) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\kappa \\,\\ln\\!\\big(1 + \\beta E_j\\big)\\,\\left[\\,1 - \\left(\\dfrac{E_{\\mathrm{th}}}{E_j}\\right)^{\\gamma}\\right],  E_j > E_{\\mathrm{th}} \\\\[6pt]\n0,  E_j \\le E_{\\mathrm{th}}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis results in a corresponding vector of yield values, $Y_j = Y(E_j)$.\n\n**4. Computation of Required Quantities**\nWith the discretized functions $f(E_j)$ and $Y(E_j)$ available, the required integrals are computed using the same numerical quadrature method (trapezoidal rule).\n\n- **Mean Energy, $\\bar{E}$**: This is the first moment of the distribution $f(E)$.\n$$\n\\bar{E} = \\int_{0}^{E_{\\max}} E\\,f(E)\\,dE \\approx \\int_{0}^{E_{\\max}} \\text{integrand}_{\\bar{E}}(E) \\,dE\n$$\nwhere the integrand is the element-wise product of the energy grid and the PDF values, $\\text{integrand}_{\\bar{E}}(E_j) = E_j \\cdot f(E_j)$.\n\n- **Average Sputtering Yield, $\\bar{Y}$**: This is the expectation of the yield function $Y(E)$.\n$$\n\\bar{Y} = \\int_{0}^{E_{\\max}} Y(E)\\,f(E)\\,dE \\approx \\int_{0}^{E_{\\max}} \\text{integrand}_{\\bar{Y}}(E) \\,dE\n$$\nwhere the integrand is the element-wise product of the yield and PDF values, $\\text{integrand}_{\\bar{Y}}(E_j) = Y(E_j) \\cdot f(E_j)$.\n\n- **Yield at Mean Energy, $Y(\\bar{E})$**: Once the scalar value $\\bar{E}$ is computed, it is used as the input to the original (continuous) sputtering yield function $Y(E)$. Particular care is taken to apply the threshold condition: if $\\bar{E} \\le E_{\\mathrm{th}}$, then $Y(\\bar{E}) = 0$. Otherwise, the full formula is used.\n\n- **Nonlinearity Metric, $\\Delta$**: This is computed by the simple subtraction:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\bar{Y} - Y(\\bar{E})\n$$\nThis metric is a direct measure of the effect of the distribution's width, as described by Jensen's inequality. For a nonlinear function $Y(E)$, the average of the function, $\\bar{Y} = \\langle Y(E) \\rangle$, is not generally equal to the function of the average, $Y(\\bar{E})$. A positive $\\Delta$ indicates that, on average, the concavity of the yield curve leads to a higher mean yield than what would be estimated from the mean energy alone.\n\nThis logical procedure is applied systematically to each of the three test cases provided.",
