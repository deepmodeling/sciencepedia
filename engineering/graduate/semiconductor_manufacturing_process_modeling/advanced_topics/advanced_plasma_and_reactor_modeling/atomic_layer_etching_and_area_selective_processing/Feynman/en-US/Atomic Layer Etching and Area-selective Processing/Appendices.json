            "problem": "Consider the activation step in Atomic Layer Etching (ALE), an approach within area-selective processing (ASP) where a halogen species chemisorbs to reactive sites on a semiconductor surface prior to a subsequent ligand-exchange removal step. Assume that the activation proceeds by Langmuir adsorption kinetics with negligible desorption during the short activation pulse, no lateral interactions, and a single adsorption site per adsorbed molecule. Let the fractional surface coverage be denoted by $\\theta(t)$, defined as the fraction of the total adsorption sites that are occupied at time $t$. The impingement flux of the activator is $F$ (molecules per $\\text{m}^2 \\cdot \\text{s}$), the sticking probability is $s$ (the fraction of impinging molecules that irreversibly adsorb on vacant sites), and the site density is $N_s$ (sites per $\\text{m}^2$). Starting from a clean surface with $\\theta(0) = 0$, and using only fundamental rate arguments consistent with Langmuir adsorption, derive the time evolution of $\\theta(t)$ and compute the time required to reach $\\theta = 0.95$ during the activation step. Use the following physically reasonable parameters representative of halogen activation on silicon in a low-pressure reactor: $F = 1.5 \\times 10^{22}$, $s = 0.15$, and $N_s = 7.5 \\times 10^{18}$. Express the final time in seconds and round your numerical result to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The rate of change of the surface coverage, $\\theta(t)$, is determined by the rate at which molecules adsorb onto the surface. Let $N_{occ}(t)$ be the number of occupied sites per unit area at time $t$. The fractional coverage is defined as $\\theta(t) = \\frac{N_{occ}(t)}{N_s}$.\n\nThe rate of adsorption is the rate at which sites become occupied. This rate is proportional to the flux of impinging molecules, $F$, the probability that an impinging molecule sticks, $s$, and the probability that it strikes a vacant site. The fraction of vacant sites at time $t$ is $(1 - \\theta(t))$. Therefore, the rate of increase in the number of occupied sites per unit area is:\n$$ \\frac{d N_{occ}}{dt} = F \\cdot s \\cdot (1 - \\theta(t)) $$\nThe problem states that desorption is negligible, so there is no corresponding loss term.\n\nTo express this equation in terms of $\\theta(t)$, we differentiate the definition of $\\theta(t)$ with respect to time $t$. Since $N_s$ is a constant, we have:\n$$ \\frac{d N_{occ}}{dt} = N_s \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} $$\nEquating the two expressions for $\\frac{d N_{occ}}{dt}$ yields the governing differential equation for the surface coverage:\n$$ N_s \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = F \\cdot s \\cdot (1 - \\theta) $$\nRearranging gives the standard form of a first-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = \\frac{F \\cdot s}{N_s} (1 - \\theta) $$\nThis equation is separable. We can rearrange it as:\n$$ \\frac{d\\theta}{1 - \\theta} = \\frac{F \\cdot s}{N_s} dt $$\nTo find the time evolution of $\\theta(t)$, we integrate both sides. The initial condition is a clean surface, so $\\theta = 0$ at $t = 0$. We integrate from $\\theta' = 0$ to $\\theta' = \\theta(t)$ on the left, and from $t' = 0$ to $t' = t$ on the right:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\theta(t)} \\frac{1}{1 - \\theta'} d\\theta' = \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{F \\cdot s}{N_s} dt' $$\nThe left-hand side integral evaluates to:\n$$ \\left[ -\\ln|1 - \\theta'| \\right]_{0}^{\\theta(t)} = -\\ln(1 - \\theta(t)) - (-\\ln(1 - 0)) = -\\ln(1 - \\theta(t)) $$\nSince $\\theta(t)  1$, the absolute value is not necessary. The right-hand side integral evaluates to:\n$$ \\frac{F \\cdot s}{N_s} \\int_{0}^{t} dt' = \\frac{F \\cdot s}{N_s} t $$\nEquating the results gives:\n$$ -\\ln(1 - \\theta(t)) = \\left(\\frac{F \\cdot s}{N_s}\\right) t $$\nSolving for $\\theta(t)$:\n$$ \\ln(1 - \\theta(t)) = -\\left(\\frac{F \\cdot s}{N_s}\\right) t $$\n$$ 1 - \\theta(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{F \\cdot s}{N_s} t\\right) $$\nThis leads to the final expression for the time evolution of the surface coverage:\n$$ \\theta(t) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{F \\cdot s}{N_s} t\\right) $$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we must compute the time $t$ required to reach a fractional coverage of $\\theta = 0.95$. We substitute this value into the derived equation:\n$$ 0.95 = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{F \\cdot s}{N_s} t\\right) $$\nRearranging to solve for $t$:\n$$ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{F \\cdot s}{N_s} t\\right) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05 $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ -\\frac{F \\cdot s}{N_s} t = \\ln(0.05) $$\nFinally, isolating $t$:\n$$ t = -\\frac{N_s}{F \\cdot s} \\ln(0.05) $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $F = 1.5 \\times 10^{22} \\, \\text{m}^{-2}\\text{s}^{-1}$, $s = 0.15$, and $N_s = 7.5 \\times 10^{18} \\, \\text{m}^{-2}$.\nFirst, let's calculate the pre-factor:\n$$ \\frac{N_s}{F \\cdot s} = \\frac{7.5 \\times 10^{18}}{(1.5 \\times 10^{22})(0.15)} = \\frac{7.5 \\times 10^{18}}{2.25 \\times 10^{21}} \\, \\text{s} $$\n$$ \\frac{N_s}{F \\cdot s} = \\frac{7.5}{2.25} \\times 10^{18-21} = \\frac{1}{0.3} \\times 10^{-3} = \\frac{10}{3} \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{s} $$\nNow, we calculate the time $t$:\n$$ t = - \\left(\\frac{10}{3} \\times 10^{-3}\\right) \\ln(0.05) \\, \\text{s} $$\nUsing the value $\\ln(0.05) \\approx -2.995732$:\n$$ t \\approx - \\left(\\frac{10}{3} \\times 10^{-3}\\right) (-2.995732) \\, \\text{s} $$\n$$ t \\approx \\frac{29.95732}{3} \\times 10^{-3} \\approx 9.98577 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{s} $$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ t \\approx 9.986 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{s} $$\nIn decimal form, this is $0.009986 \\, \\text{s}$.",
