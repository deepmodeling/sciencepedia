            "solution": "The problem requires us to determine the enhancement of the effective boron diffusivity, $D_{B}$, under conditions of self-interstitial supersaturation. We begin by validating the problem statement. All provided information, including the governing equations and physical assumptions, corresponds to a standard, well-established model for transient enhanced diffusion (TED) in semiconductor materials. The problem is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. We may therefore proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nThe total flux of boron atoms, $J_{B}$, is assumed to be carried entirely by the mobile boron-interstitial pairs, $B\\!-\\!I$. The flux of these pairs, denoted $J_{B\\!-\\!I}$, is described by Fick's first law:\n$$J_{B\\!-\\!I} = - D_{B\\!-\\!I}\\,\\frac{\\partial C_{B\\!-\\!I}}{\\partial x}$$\nwhere $D_{B\\!-\\!I}$ is the diffusivity of the pair and $C_{B\\!-\\!I}$ is its concentration. Since we assume $J_{B} = J_{B\\!-\\!I}$, we have:\n$$J_{B} = - D_{B\\!-\\!I}\\,\\frac{\\partial C_{B\\!-\\!I}}{\\partial x}$$\nThe problem states that the concentration of these pairs is governed by a local mass-action equilibrium with substitutional boron, $B_{s}$, and silicon self-interstitials, $I$. The relation is given as:\n$$C_{B\\!-\\!I} = K\\,C_{B_{s}}\\,C_{I}$$\nwhere $K$ is the reaction association constant, $C_{B_{s}}$ is the concentration of substitutional boron, and $C_{I}$ is the concentration of self-interstitials.\n\nWe can substitute this expression for $C_{B\\!-\\!I}$ into the flux equation for $J_{B}$:\n$$J_{B} = - D_{B\\!-\\!I}\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( K\\,C_{B_{s}}\\,C_{I} \\right)$$\nTo evaluate the partial derivative, we apply the product rule. A critical piece of information provided is that the self-interstitial concentration $C_{I}$ is spatially uniform, although it is elevated above its equilibrium value.

It is a standard, well-posed problem in the field of semiconductor process simulation. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested: deriving the effective diffusivity, finding the expression for the junction depth increase, and performing the numerical calculation.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Effective Boron Diffusivity**\n\nBoron, a p-type dopant, resides primarily on substitutional sites ($B_s$) in the silicon lattice, where it is immobile. Its diffusion is mediated by interactions with silicon self-interstitials ($I$). The specified kick-out mechanism is described by the reversible reaction:\n$$ B_s + I \\rightleftharpoons B_i $$\nwhere $B_i$ is a highly mobile boron-interstitial pair.\n\nThe problem states that we can assume steady pairing kinetics, which implies the reaction is in local chemical equilibrium. Applying the law of mass action gives:\n$$ k_f C_{B_s} C_I = k_r C_{B_i} $$\nwhere $C_{B_s}$, $C_I$, and $C_{B_i}$ are the concentrations of substitutional boron, self-interstitials, and mobile boron-interstitial pairs, respectively, and $k_f$ and $k_r$ are the forward and reverse reaction rates.\n\nFrom this equilibrium, we can express the concentration of the mobile species, $C_{B_i}$, as:\n$$ C_{B_i} = \\frac{k_f}{k_r} C_{B_s} C_I = K_{eq}(T) C_{B_s} C_I $$\nwhere $K_{eq}(T)$ is the temperature-dependent equilibrium constant of the reaction.\n\nThe total flux of boron, $J_B$, is primarily due to the diffusion of the mobile $B_i$ species. According to Fick's first law, this flux is:\n$$ J_B = J_{B_i} = -D_{B_i} \\frac{\\partial C_{B_i}}{\\partial x} $$\nwhere $D_{B_i}$ is the diffusivity of the mobile boron-interstitial pair.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $C_{B_i}$ into the flux equation:\n$$ J_B = -D_{B_i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( K_{eq} C_{B_s} C_I \\right) $$\nThe problem stipulates that the self-interstitial supersaturation $S_I$ is spatially uniform, which implies that the self-interstitial concentration $C_I = S_I C_I^{eq}$ is also constant with respect to position $x$. Therefore, $C_I$ can be treated as a constant in the spatial derivative:\n$$ J_B = -D_{B_i} K_{eq} C_I \\frac{\\partial C_{B_s}}{\\partial x} $$\nIn typical doping scenarios, the concentration of mobile pairs is negligible compared to the substitutional dopants, so the total boron concentration $C_B = C_{B_s} + C_{B_i} \\approx C_{B_s}$. Thus, $\\frac{\\partial C_{B_s}}{\\partial x} \\approx \\frac{\\partial C_B}{\\partial x}$. The flux equation becomes:\n$$ J_B \\approx -\\left( D_{B_i} K_{eq} C_I \\right) \\frac{\\partial C_B}{\\partial x} $$\nThis equation has the form of Fick's first law for the total boron concentration, $J_B = -D_B^{eff} \\frac{\\partial C_B}{\\partial x}$, where the effective boron diffusivity $D_B^{eff}$ is:\n$$ D_B^{eff} = D_{B_i} K_{eq} C_I $$\nUnder equilibrium conditions, there is no supersaturation of interstitials, i.e., $S_I = 1$ and $C_I = C_I^{eq}$. The equilibrium boron diffusivity, $D_B^{eq}$, is defined under these conditions:\n$$ D_B^{eq} = D_{B_i} K_{eq} C_I^{eq} $$\nBy comparing the expressions for $D_B^{eff}$ and $D_B^{eq}$, we can establish their relationship:\n$$ D_B^{eff} = D_{B_i} K_{eq} C_I = (D_{B_i} K_{eq} C_I^{eq}) \\frac{C_I}{C_I^{eq}} = D_B^{eq} S_I $$\nThis fundamental result shows that the effective diffusivity of an interstitial-mediated dopant is enhanced by a factor equal to the self-interstitial supersaturation.\n\n**Part 2: Expression for Junction Depth Increase**\n\nThe problem defines the increase in junction depth as the difference in characteristic diffusion lengths. For a one-dimensional diffusion process from a localized source (a delta function), the concentration profile is a Gaussian. A robust measure for the characteristic spread or diffusion length is the standard deviation of this profile, given by $L = \\sqrt{2Dt}$.\n\nUnder equilibrium conditions (no TED), the diffusivity is $D_B^{eq}$, and the diffusion length is:\n$$ L_{eq} = \\sqrt{2 D_B^{eq} t} $$\nUnder TED, the diffusivity is enhanced to $D_B^{eff} = D_B^{eq} S_I$. The corresponding diffusion length is:\n$$ L_{TED} = \\sqrt{2 D_B^{eff} t} = \\sqrt{2 (D_B^{eq} S_I) t} $$\nThe increase in junction depth, $\\Delta L$, is defined as the difference between these two lengths:\n$$ \\Delta L = L_{TED} - L_{eq} = \\sqrt{2 D_B^{eq} S_I t} - \\sqrt{2 D_B^{eq} t} $$\nFactoring out the common term gives the desired closed-form expression:\n$$ \\Delta L = \\sqrt{2 D_B^{eq} t} (\\sqrt{S_I} - 1) $$\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into the derived expression.\nThe given parameters are:\n- $D_B^{eq} = 3 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{cm^2/s}$\n- $t = 10\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n- $S_I = 20$\n\nFirst, calculate the equilibrium diffusion length component, $\\sqrt{2 D_B^{eq} t}$:\n$$ \\sqrt{2 D_B^{eq} t} = \\sqrt{2 \\times (3 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{cm^2/s}) \\times (10\\,\\mathrm{s})} = \\sqrt{6 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{cm^2}} = \\sqrt{6} \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{cm} $$\nNext, calculate the enhancement factor, $(\\sqrt{S_I} - 1)$:\n$$ \\sqrt{S_I} - 1 = \\sqrt{20} - 1 $$\nNow, combine these to find $\\Delta L$ in centimeters:\n$$ \\Delta L = (\\sqrt{6} \\times 10^{-7}) \\times (\\sqrt{20} - 1) \\,\\mathrm{cm} $$\nUsing numerical values $\\sqrt{6} \\approx 2.44949$ and $\\sqrt{20} \\approx 4.47214$:\n$$ \\Delta L \\approx (2.44949 \\times 10^{-7}) \\times (4.47214 - 1) \\,\\mathrm{cm} $$\n$$ \\Delta L \\approx (2.44949 \\times 10^{-7}) \\times (3.47214) \\,\\mathrm{cm} $$\n$$ \\Delta L \\approx 8.5042 \\times 10^{-7} \\,\\mathrm{cm} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in nanometers (nm).

The net rate of formation of clusters is $R_f - R_r$.\n\nThe coupled rate equations are derived from the continuity equation for each species, accounting for reaction, diffusion, and other source/sink terms.\n\n1.  **For substitutional dopants $A_s$**: Assuming dopants are immobile (a common assumption for substitutional species), their concentration changes only due to the reaction where one $A_s$ is consumed to form one $AI_m$.\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial C_{A_s}}{\\partial t} = - (R_f - R_r) = -k_f C_{A_s} C_I^m + k_r C_{AI_m} $$\n\n2.  **For dopant-interstitial clusters $AI_m$**: Assuming clusters are also immobile, their concentration changes only due to the reaction.\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial C_{AI_m}}{\\partial t} = R_f - R_r = k_f C_{A_s} C_I^m - k_r C_{AI_m} $$\n    Note that adding this equation to the equation for $C_{A_s}$ gives $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} (C_{A_s} + C_{AI_m}) = 0$, which enforces the conservation of the total dopant concentration, $C_{A, \\mathrm{tot}} = C_{A_s} + C_{AI_m}$, as required.\n\n3.  **For self-interstitials $I$**: Interstitials are mobile and their transport is described by Fick's law.

Let's solve the above equation for $C_{AI_m}$:\n$$ k_f C_{A, \\mathrm{tot}} C_I^m - k_f C_{AI_m} C_I^m = k_r C_{AI_m} $$\n$$ k_f C_{A, \\mathrm{tot}} C_I^m = (k_r + k_f C_I^m) C_{AI_m} $$\n$$ C_{AI_m} = \\left( \\frac{k_f C_I^m}{k_r + k_f C_I^m} \\right) C_{A, \\mathrm{tot}} $$\nDividing by $C_{A, \\mathrm{tot}}$ gives the desired fraction:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{cl}} = \\frac{C_{AI_m}}{C_{A, \\mathrm{tot}}} = \\frac{k_f C_I^m}{k_r + k_f C_I^m} $$\nThis expression can be simplified by dividing the numerator and denominator by $k_r$:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{cl}} = \\frac{\\frac{k_f C_I^m}{k_r}}{1 + \\frac{k_f C_I^m}{k_r}} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values provided:\n-   $m = 2$\n-   $k_f = 1.0 \\times 10^{-34}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{6}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n-   $k_r = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n-   $C_I = 5.0 \\times 10^{15}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the dimensionless term $\\frac{k_f C_I^m}{k_r}$:\n$$ C_I^m = C_I^2 = (5.0 \\times 10^{15}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3})^2 = 25.0 \\times 10^{30}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-6} = 2.5 \\times 10^{31}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-6} $$\n$$ \\frac{k_f C_I^2}{k_r} = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{-34}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{6}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (2.5 \\times 10^{31}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-6})}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} $$\n$$ \\frac{k_f C_I^2}{k_r} = \\frac{2.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 2.5 $$\nNow substitute this value back into the expression for $f_{\\mathrm{cl}}$:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{cl}} = \\frac{2.5}{1 + 2.5} = \\frac{2.5}{3.5} = \\frac{25}{35} = \\frac{5}{7} $$\nTo obtain a numerical value rounded to four significant figures:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{cl}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\approx 0.7142857... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.7143$.\nNote that the total dopant concentration $C_{A,\\mathrm{tot}}$ was not needed to calculate the fraction, as is expected for a system governed by first-order kinetics with respect to the partitioned species ($A_s$ and $AI_m$).",
