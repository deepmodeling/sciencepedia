The derivation will proceed in two steps: first, constructing the likelihood function from the given properties of the process, and second, maximizing this function with respect to $C$.\n\n**Step 1: Problem Validation**\n\nThe givens are extracted verbatim from the problem statement:\n- Model: A homogeneous spatial Poisson point process for dopant atoms.\n- Unknown parameter: A constant volumetric dopant concentration $C$ (with units $\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$).\n- Observation window: $V \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{3}$.\n- Known volume: $\\mathrm{vol}(V)=V$ (in $\\mathrm{cm}^{3}$).\n- Observation data: $N$ distinct dopant positions $\\{ \\mathbf{x}_{i} \\}_{i=1}^{N}$ inside $V$.\n- Property 1: For any measurable $A \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{3}$, the count $N(A)$ is Poisson distributed with mean $C \\,\\mathrm{vol}(A)$.\n- Property 2: Counts in disjoint sets are independent.\n- Property 3: Conditional on $N(V)=n$, the $n$ points are independently and identically distributed uniformly over $V$.\n\nThe problem is validated as follows:\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The use of a homogeneous Poisson point process to model dopant distributions is a standard and physically meaningful approach in semiconductor device physics, particularly for analyzing the effects of random dopant fluctuations in nanoscale transistors. The model is well-established.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is a standard parameter estimation task (Maximum Likelihood Estimation) for a well-defined statistical model. The information provided is sufficient to derive a unique solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise mathematical and physical terminology, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem provides a complete set of axioms for the Poisson point process needed to construct the likelihood function. There are no internal contradictions.\n\nThe problem is deemed valid and a solution can be sought.\n\n**Step 2: Derivation of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator $\\hat{C}$**\n\n**Part 1: Construction of the Likelihood Function**\n\nThe likelihood function, $L(C \\mid \\{ \\mathbf{x}_{i} \\}_{i=1}^{N})$, is the probability density of observing the data—which consists of the count $N$ and the specific locations $\\{ \\mathbf{x}_{i} \\}_{i=1}^{N}$—given the parameter $C$. We can express this joint density as the product of the probability of the count and the conditional probability density of the locations given the count:\n$$\nL(C \\mid \\{ \\mathbf{x}_{i} \\}_{i=1}^{N}) = P(N(V)=N \\mid C) \\times f(\\{\\mathbf{x}_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{N} \\mid N(V)=N, C)\n$$\nWe evaluate each term based on the properties given in the problem statement.\n\n1.  **Probability of the count $N$**: According to Property 1, the number of points in the volume $V$, denoted $N(V)$, follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda = C \\cdot \\mathrm{vol}(V) = CV$. The probability of observing exactly $N$ points is therefore:\n    $$\n    P(N(V)=N \\mid C) = \\frac{(CV)^{N} \\exp(-CV)}{N!}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Conditional density of the locations $\\{\\mathbf{x}_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{N}$**: According to Property 3, conditional on observing $N$ points in $V$, their locations are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) with a uniform distribution over the volume $V$. The probability density function for a single point at location $\\mathbf{x}$ within $V$ is $f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{vol}(V)} = \\frac{1}{V}$. Since the $N$ locations are i.i.d., their joint conditional probability density is the product of their individual densities:\n    $$\n    f(\\{\\mathbf{x}_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{N} \\mid N(V)=N) = \\prod_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{1}{V} = \\left(\\frac{1}{V}\\right)^{N} = V^{-N}\n    $$\n    Note that this conditional density is independent of the parameter $C$.\n\nCombining these two parts, the full likelihood function is:\n$$\nL(C \\mid \\{ \\mathbf{x}_{i} \\}_{i=1}^{N}) = \\left( \\frac{(CV)^{N} \\exp(-CV)}{N!} \\right) \\times \\left( V^{-N} \\right)\n$$\nSimplifying the expression:\n$$\nL(C) = \\frac{C^N V^N \\exp(-CV)}{N! V^N} = \\frac{C^N \\exp(-CV)}{N!}\n$$\nThe problem permits expressing the likelihood up to a factor that does not depend on $C$. The term $N!$ in the denominator is such a factor. Therefore, the likelihood function to be maximized is proportional to:\n$$\nL(C) \\propto C^N \\exp(-CV)\n$$\nAn important observation is that the final form of the likelihood function depends only on the count $N$ and not on the specific locations $\\{\\mathbf{x}_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{N}$. This means that for a homogeneous Poisson process, the total count $N$ in the volume $V$ is a sufficient statistic for estimating the intensity $C$.\n\n**Part 2: Maximization of the Likelihood Function**\n\nTo find the value of $C$ that maximizes $L(C)$, it is more convenient to maximize the natural logarithm of the likelihood, the log-likelihood function $\\ell(C)$, as the logarithm is a monotonically increasing function.\n$$\n\\ell(C) = \\ln(L(C)) \\propto \\ln(C^N \\exp(-CV))\n$$\n$$\n\\ell(C) = \\ln(C^N) + \\ln(\\exp(-CV)) = N \\ln(C) - CV\n$$\nTo find the maximum, we compute the derivative of $\\ell(C)$ with respect to $C$ and set it to zero.\n$$\n\\frac{d\\ell(C)}{dC} = \\frac{d}{dC} (N \\ln(C) - CV) = N \\cdot \\frac{1}{C} - V\n$$\nSetting the derivative to zero gives the maximum likelihood estimate $\\hat{C}$:\n$$\n\\frac{N}{\\hat{C}} - V = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{N}{\\hat{C}} = V\n$$\nSolving for $\\hat{C}$:\n$$\n\\hat{C} = \\frac{N}{V}\n$$\nTo confirm that this corresponds to a maximum, we examine the second derivative of the log-likelihood:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\ell(C)}{dC^2} = \\frac{d}{dC} \\left(\\frac{N}{C} - V\\right) = - \\frac{N}{C^2}\n$$\nSince the number of observed dopants $N$ must be non-negative ($N \\ge 0$) and the concentration $C$ must be positive ($C > 0$), we have $C^2 > 0$. If $N>0$, then $\\frac{d^2\\ell(C)}{dC^2}  0$, which confirms that $\\hat{C} = N/V$ is indeed a local maximum. Since it is the only critical point in the domain $C > 0$, it is the global maximum. If $N=0$, the likelihood $L(C) = \\exp(-CV)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $C$, maximized as $C \\to 0^+$. The formula $\\hat{C} = N/V = 0/V = 0$ is consistent with this case.\n\nThe maximum likelihood estimator for the dopant concentration $C$ is the observed number of dopants $N$ divided by the volume of the observation window $V$.",

Let's first determine the contribution of a single dopant.\n\nA single dopant with charge $q$ located at a position $\\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)$ induces an effective areal charge density at the gate. According to the problem statement, the effective areal weight is $w(z)/(W L)$. Thus, the effective areal gate charge density $Q'$ due to this single dopant is:\n$$ Q' = \\frac{q \\cdot w(z)}{W L} $$\nThe resulting shift in threshold voltage, $\\Delta V_{T, \\text{single}}$, from this single dopant is given by:\n$$ \\Delta V_{T, \\text{single}}(z) = \\frac{Q'}{C_{ox}} = \\frac{q \\cdot w(z)}{C_{ox} W L} $$\nGiven $w(z) = \\exp(-z/\\lambda)$, this becomes:\n$$ \\Delta V_{T, \\text{single}}(z) = \\frac{q}{C_{ox} W L} \\exp(-z/\\lambda) $$\n\nThe total threshold voltage shift, $\\Delta V_T$, is the a sum over all dopants present in the volume $\\Omega$:\n$$ \\Delta V_T = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\Delta V_{T, \\text{single}}(z_i) $$\nwhere $N$ is the random number of dopants in $\\Omega$, and $z_i$ is the depth of the $i$-th dopant.\n\nWe need to find the variance of $\\Delta V_T$, denoted by $\\sigma^2_{\\Delta V_T}$. Since the dopants are distributed according to a spatial Poisson point process with intensity $\\rho$, the variance of the sum of functions evaluated at the points of the process can be calculated using Campbell's Theorem for shot noise processes. The theorem states that for a process $X = \\sum_{i} h(\\mathbf{r}_i)$, where the points $\\mathbf{r}_i$ are from a Poisson process with intensity $\\rho$, the variance of $X$ is given by:\n$$ \\text{Var}[X] = \\rho \\int_{\\Omega} [h(\\mathbf{r})]^2 dV $$\nIn our case, the function $h(\\mathbf{r})$ is the contribution from a single dopant, $h(\\mathbf{r}) = \\Delta V_{T, \\text{single}}(z)$. The integration volume is $\\Omega = [0,L] \\times [0,W] \\times [0,T]$ and the volume element is $dV = dx \\, dy \\, dz$.\n\nApplying this theorem, the variance of the threshold voltage fluctuation is:\n$$ \\sigma^2_{\\Delta V_T} = \\text{Var}[\\Delta V_T] = \\rho \\int_{0}^{T} \\int_{0}^{W} \\int_{0}^{L} \\left( \\frac{q}{C_{ox} W L} \\exp(-z/\\lambda) \\right)^2 dx \\, dy \\, dz $$\n\nWe can separate the constants and the integrals:\n$$ \\sigma^2_{\\Delta V_T} = \\rho \\left( \\frac{q}{C_{ox} W L} \\right)^2 \\int_{0}^{T} \\int_{0}^{W} \\int_{0}^{L} \\exp(-2z/\\lambda) \\, dx \\, dy \\, dz $$\nThe integrand does not depend on $x$ or $y$, so the integrals over these coordinates are straightforward:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{L} dx = L $$\n$$ \\int_{0}^{W} dy = W $$\nSubstituting these results into the expression for the variance:\n$$ \\sigma^2_{\\Delta V_T} = \\rho \\frac{q^2}{C_{ox}^2 (W L)^2} (W L) \\int_{0}^{T} \\exp(-2z/\\lambda) \\, dz $$\nSimplifying the pre-integral factor:\n$$ \\sigma^2_{\\Delta V_T} = \\frac{\\rho q^2}{C_{ox}^2 W L} \\int_{0}^{T} \\exp(-2z/\\lambda) \\, dz $$\nNow, we evaluate the remaining integral with respect to $z$:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{T} \\exp(-2z/\\lambda) \\, dz = \\left[ \\frac{\\exp(-2z/\\lambda)}{-2/\\lambda} \\right]_{0}^{T} = -\\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\left( \\exp(-2T/\\lambda) - \\exp(0) \\right) $$\n$$ = -\\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\left( \\exp(-2T/\\lambda) - 1 \\right) = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\left( 1 - \\exp(-2T/\\lambda) \\right) $$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $\\sigma^2_{\\Delta V_T}$:\n$$ \\sigma^2_{\\Delta V_T} = \\frac{\\rho q^2}{C_{ox}^2 W L} \\left[ \\frac{\\lambda}{2} (1 - \\exp(-2T/\\lambda)) \\right] $$\nThe problem defines the Pelgrom parameter $A_{V_T}$ via the relation $\\sigma_{\\Delta V_T} = A_{V_T}/\\sqrt{W L}$.

The skewness of $S$ (and hence of $V_T$) is:\n$$ \\gamma_1 = \\frac{\\lambda E[Y^3]}{(\\lambda E[Y^2])^{3/2}} = \\frac{E[Y^3]}{\\sqrt{\\lambda} (E[Y^2])^{3/2}} $$\nTo proceed, we must compute the moments of the individual dopant contribution, $Y = A \\exp(-X/\\ell)$, where the random variable $X$ has the probability density function $p(x) = \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\exp(-x/\\beta)$ for $x \\geq 0$.\n\nThe $k$-th moment of $Y$ is given by:\n$$ E[Y^k] = E\\left[\\left(A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{X}{\\ell}\\right)\\right)^k\\right] = E\\left[A^k \\exp\\left(-\\frac{kX}{\\ell}\\right)\\right] = A^k E\\left[\\exp\\left(-\\frac{kX}{\\ell}\\right)\\right] $$\nWe calculate the expectation by integrating over the distribution of $X$:\n$$ E\\left[\\exp\\left(-\\frac{kX}{\\ell}\\right)\\right] = \\int_0^\\infty \\exp\\left(-\\frac{kx}{\\ell}\\right) p(x) \\, dx = \\int_0^\\infty \\exp\\left(-\\frac{kx}{\\ell}\\right) \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\beta}\\right) \\, dx $$\n$$ = \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\int_0^\\infty \\exp\\left(-x\\left(\\frac{k}{\\ell} + \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\right)\\right) \\, dx = \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\int_0^\\infty \\exp\\left(-x\\frac{k\\beta + \\ell}{\\ell\\beta}\\right) \\, dx $$\nThis is a standard exponential integral:\n$$ = \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\left[ -\\frac{\\ell\\beta}{k\\beta + \\ell} \\exp\\left(-x\\frac{k\\beta + \\ell}{\\ell\\beta}\\right) \\right]_0^\\infty = \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\left(0 - \\left(-\\frac{\\ell\\beta}{k\\beta + \\ell}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{\\ell}{k\\beta + \\ell} $$\nThus, the $k$-th moment of $Y$ is:\n$$ E[Y^k] = A^k \\frac{\\ell}{k\\beta + \\ell} $$\nWe need the second ($k=2$) and third ($k=3$) moments:\n$$ E[Y^2] = A^2 \\frac{\\ell}{2\\beta + \\ell} $$\n$$ E[Y^3] = A^3 \\frac{\\ell}{3\\beta + \\ell} $$\nNow we substitute these into the expression for skewness. The constant $A$ cancels out:\n$$ \\gamma_1 = \\frac{A^3 \\frac{\\ell}{3\\beta + \\ell}}{\\sqrt{\\lambda} \\left(A^2 \\frac{\\ell}{2\\beta + \\ell}\\right)^{3/2}} = \\frac{A^3 \\ell (3\\beta + \\ell)^{-1}}{\\sqrt{\\lambda} A^3 \\ell^{3/2} (2\\beta + \\ell)^{-3/2}} $$\n$$ \\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\lambda} \\sqrt{\\ell}} \\frac{(2\\beta + \\ell)^{3/2}}{3\\beta + \\ell} $$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the skewness $\\gamma_1$.\n\nNext, we evaluate $\\gamma_1$ numerically for $\\ell = 1\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $\\beta = 2\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, and $\\lambda = 50$.\n$$ \\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{50}\\sqrt{1}} \\frac{(2(2) + 1)^{3/2}}{3(2) + 1} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{50}} \\frac{5^{3/2}}{7} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{5}}{7 \\cdot 5\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{7\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{14} $$\nNumerically, this value is:\n$$ \\gamma_1 \\approx \\frac{3.16227766}{14} \\approx 0.22587697... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\gamma_1 \\approx 0.2259$.\n\nFinally, we determine the minimal expected dopant count $\\lambda_{\\min}$ such that the Gaussian approximation is adequate, i.e., $|\\gamma_1|  \\varepsilon$ for $\\varepsilon = 0.10$. Since all parameters are positive, $\\gamma_1  0$, so the condition is $\\gamma_1  \\varepsilon$. As $\\gamma_1$ is a decreasing function of $\\lambda$, the minimal count $\\lambda_{\\min}$ occurs at the boundary $\\gamma_1 = \\varepsilon$.\n$$ \\varepsilon = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\lambda_{\\min}} \\sqrt{\\ell}} \\frac{(2\\beta + \\ell)^{3/2}}{3\\beta + \\ell} $$\nSolving for $\\lambda_{\\min}$:\n$$ \\sqrt{\\lambda_{\\min}} = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon \\sqrt{\\ell}} \\frac{(2\\beta + \\ell)^{3/2}}{3\\beta + \\ell} $$\n$$ \\lambda_{\\min} = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon^2 \\ell} \\frac{(2\\beta + \\ell)^3}{(3\\beta + \\ell)^2} $$\nWe substitute the given values $\\varepsilon = 0.10$, $\\ell = 1\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, and $\\beta = 2\\,\\mathrm{nm}$:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\min} = \\frac{1}{(0.10)^2 (1)} \\frac{(2(2) + 1)^3}{(3(2) + 1)^2} = \\frac{1}{0.01} \\frac{5^3}{7^2} = 100 \\times \\frac{125}{49} = \\frac{12500}{49} $$\nNumerically, this value is:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\min} \\approx 255.10204... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\lambda_{\\min} \\approx 255.1$.\n\nThe two numerical results are the skewness $\\gamma_1$ and the minimal expected dopant count $\\lambda_{\\min}$.",
