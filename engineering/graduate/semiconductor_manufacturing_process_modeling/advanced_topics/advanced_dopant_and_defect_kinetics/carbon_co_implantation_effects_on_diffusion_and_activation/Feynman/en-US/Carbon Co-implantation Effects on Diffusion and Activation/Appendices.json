            "introduction": "To begin our practical exploration, we will connect a macroscopic, experimentally measurable quantity—the broadening of a dopant profile—to the microscopic kinetics of point defects. Ion implantation introduces excess self-interstitials, which cause the transient enhanced diffusion (TED) of dopants like boron. This first exercise models how co-implanted carbon acts as a sink for these interstitials, thereby suppressing TED. By analyzing hypothetical junction broadening data, you will extract a key kinetic parameter that quantifies the efficiency of carbon as an interstitial trap .",

            "problem": "A transient enhanced diffusion (TED) event is triggered by ion implantation of boron into crystalline silicon, followed by a rapid thermal anneal at a uniform temperature. In a one-dimensional treatment and under the assumptions of a spatially uniform point-defect supersaturation, the boron diffusivity can be modeled as time-dependent through an interstitial supersaturation factor. Specifically, take the effective diffusivity to be $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}(t) = D_{\\mathrm{eq}} S_{I}(t)$, where $D_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ is the equilibrium boron diffusivity at the anneal temperature and $S_{I}(t)$ is the silicon self-interstitial supersaturation. For an initially localized dopant distribution with a well-defined second central moment, the increase in the variance $\\Delta \\sigma^{2}(t)$ during anneal is related to the diffusivity by $\\Delta \\sigma^{2}(t) = 2 \\int_{0}^{t} D_{\\mathrm{eff}}(t^{\\prime}) \\,\\mathrm{d}t^{\\prime}$.\n\nAssume a simple kinetic form for the interstitial supersaturation,\n$S_{I}(t) = 1 + S_{0} \\exp(-k t)$,\nwhere $S_{0}$ characterizes the initial supersaturation amplitude due to implantation damage and $k$ is the net decay rate of the supersaturation toward unity due to recombination and sinks.

            "solution": "The increase in variance, $\\Delta \\sigma^{2}(t)$, is given by the integral of the effective diffusivity, $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}(t)$:\n$$ \\Delta \\sigma^{2}(t) = 2 \\int_{0}^{t} D_{\\mathrm{eff}}(t^{\\prime}) \\,\\mathrm{d}t^{\\prime} $$\nThe effective diffusivity is defined as $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}(t) = D_{\\mathrm{eq}} S_{I}(t)$, where $D_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ is the equilibrium diffusivity and $S_{I}(t)$ is the interstitial supersaturation. The supersaturation is modeled as $S_{I}(t) = 1 + S_{0} \\exp(-k t)$.

Let's test this hypothesis by substituting it into the first equation:\n$$ 216.166179... \\approx 250 \\left(1 - \\exp(-10 k_{\\mathrm{ann}})\\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{216.166179...}{250} \\approx 0.8646647... = 1 - \\exp(-10 k_{\\mathrm{ann}}) $$\n$$ \\exp(-10 k_{\\mathrm{ann}}) \\approx 0.135335... $$\nThis value is recognized as $\\exp(-2)$. Thus, we can deduce that $10 k_{\\mathrm{ann}} = 2$, which gives $k_{\\mathrm{ann}} = 0.2\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. With this value, the approximation $\\exp(-100 k_{\\mathrm{ann}}) = \\exp(-20)$ is extremely close to zero, validating the assumption.\nFrom $\\frac{S_0}{k_{\\mathrm{ann}}} = 250\\ \\mathrm{s}$, we find $S_0 = 250 \\times k_{\\mathrm{ann}} = 250 \\times 0.2 = 50$. The initial supersaturation factor $S_0$ is a dimensionless quantity.\n\nNext, we analyze the sample co-implanted with carbon. The decay rate is now $k_{\\mathrm{C}} = k_{\\mathrm{ann}} + k_{\\mathrm{CI}} C_{\\mathrm{C}}$. The parameter $S_0 = 50$ is assumed to be unchanged. We have one data point:\nAt $t_1 = 10\\ \\mathrm{s}$, $\\Delta \\sigma^{2}_{\\mathrm{C}}(t_1) = 2.440903110073812 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2}$.\nUsing the same rearranged equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta \\sigma^{2}_{\\mathrm{C}}(t_1)}{2 D_{\\mathrm{eq}}} - t_1 = \\frac{S_0}{k_{\\mathrm{C}}} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-k_{\\mathrm{C}} t_1\\right)\\right) $$\nPlugging in the values:\n$$ \\frac{2.440903110073812 \\times 10^{-12}}{2 \\times 1.5 \\times 10^{-14}} - 10 = 81.3634370024604 - 10 = 71.3634370024604\\ \\mathrm{s} $$\nWith $S_0 = 50$ and $t_1=10$, we must solve for $k_{\\mathrm{C}}$:\n$$ 71.363437... = \\frac{50}{k_{\\mathrm{C}}} \\left(1 - \\exp(-10 k_{\\mathrm{C}})\\right) $$\nLet's test integer values for the argument of the exponential. If we hypothesize $10 k_{\\mathrm{C}} = 7$, then $k_{\\mathrm{C}} = 0.7\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Let's check the right-hand side:\n$$ \\frac{50}{0.7} \\left(1 - \\exp(-7)\\right) = \\frac{500}{7} \\left(1 - \\exp(-7)\\right) $$\nUsing the value $\\exp(-7) \\approx 0.00091188196$:\n$$ \\frac{500}{7} (1 - 0.00091188196) = \\frac{500}{7} (0.99908811804) = 71.363437002... \\mathrm{s} $$\nThis matches the value derived from the experimental data perfectly. Thus, the decay rate in the presence of carbon is $k_{\\mathrm{C}} = 0.7\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nFinally, we find the carbon-interstitial capture coefficient $k_{\\mathrm{CI}}$ from the relationship $k_{\\mathrm{C}} = k_{\\mathrm{ann}} + k_{\\mathrm{CI}} C_{\\mathrm{C}}$.\nRearranging for $k_{\\mathrm{CI}}$:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{CI}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{C}} - k_{\\mathrm{ann}}}{C_{\\mathrm{C}}} $$\nWe substitute the determined values: $k_{\\mathrm{C}} = 0.7\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $k_{\\mathrm{ann}} = 0.2\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, and the given carbon concentration $C_{\\mathrm{C}} = 5.00 \\times 10^{18}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{CI}} = \\frac{0.7\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} - 0.2\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{5.00 \\times 10^{18}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}} = \\frac{0.5\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{5.00 \\times 10^{18}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}} $$\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{CI}} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{3}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nThe result is required to three significant figures, which matches the precision of the input $C_{\\mathrm{C}}$.\n\nQualitative commentary:\nThe parameter $k_{\\mathrm{CI}}$ is a microscopic capture coefficient. In principle, it is a material constant at a given temperature and should be independent of the carbon dose or concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{C}}$. The overall sink strength, given by the product $k_{\\mathrm{CI}} C_{\\mathrm{C}}$, is what scales with the carbon dose.\nThe extracted value of $k_{\\mathrm{CI}}$ using this simplified one-dimensional model, however, can show an apparent dependence on implant energy. This model assumes spatially uniform concentrations of interstitials and carbon. In a real implant, both the initial damage (the source of interstitials) and the implanted carbon have depth profiles that depend on their respective implant energies. The effectiveness of carbon as a sink for interstitials is highly sensitive to the spatial overlap between the interstitial population and the carbon profile. The extracted $k_{\\mathrm{CI}}$ is an effective, spatially-averaged parameter. Therefore, if the implant energies of boron and carbon are varied, the overlap of their profiles will change, leading to a change in the observed sink efficiency and thus a different apparent value for $k_{\\mathrm{CI}}$, even if the true microscopic coefficient remains constant. An implant scheme that maximizes the spatial overlap between the excess interstitials and the substitutional carbon will result in a larger extracted value for the sink term.",

            "problem": "Consider a simplified, scientifically plausible model for boron diffusion in crystalline silicon under transient enhanced diffusion suppression by carbon co-implantation. The starting point is Fick's law, which establishes that diffusive flux is proportional to the gradient of mobile species concentration. In crystalline silicon, boron diffusion is mediated by silicon self-interstitials, and the diffusion coefficient in the absence of carbon follows an Arrhenius-type temperature dependence. Carbon co-implantation both traps interstitials and forms immobile boron–carbon complexes, thereby reducing the population of mobile boron–interstitial pairs. Using these well-established bases, derive a predictive relation for the boron diffusion coefficient as a function of temperature and substitutional carbon concentration that incorporates two unknown parameters representing interstitial trapping and boron–carbon complex formation. The derivation must start from the following foundational elements:\n\n- The Arrhenius form of a diffusion coefficient in the absence of carbon: $$D_B^0(T) = D_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{k_B T}\\right),$$ where $D_0$ is the pre-exponential factor, $E_a$ is the activation energy, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\n- A mass-action perspective for defect reactions and complex formation, yielding physically meaningful reduction factors that depend on substitutional carbon concentration $[C_s]$, with positive parameters scaling the propensity of interstitial trapping and complex formation.\n\nAssume that both interstitial trapping by carbon and boron deactivation via boron–carbon complex formation multiplicatively reduce the effective boron diffusion coefficient relative to the Arrhenius baseline. The two unknown parameters are $k_{CI}$ (a positive parameter quantifying carbon–interstitial trapping strength) and $K_{BC}$ (a positive equilibrium-like parameter quantifying boron–carbon complex propensity). Both $k_{CI}$ and $K_{BC}$ have the physical unit of inverse concentration and therefore must be expressed in $\\mathrm{m^3}$.\n\nYour tasks are:\n\n1. From the fundamental bases above, derive a closed-form expression for the effective boron diffusion coefficient $D_B(T,[C_s])$ that depends on $D_0$, $E_a$, $k_B$, $T$, $[C_s]$, $k_{CI}$, and $K_{BC}$, and is strictly positive for all physically relevant inputs. Clearly justify each modeling step and the multiplicative structure.\n\n2. Using the derived model, construct a synthetic dataset of observed diffusion coefficients over specified temperature and carbon concentration grids by evaluating the model at known parameter values $(k_{CI}^\\star, K_{BC}^\\star)$ and then corrupting the result with log-normal noise.

            "solution": "#### Derivation of the Effective Diffusion Coefficient Model\nThe effective boron diffusion coefficient, $D_B(T,[C_s])$, is constructed from the baseline intrinsic diffusion coefficient, $D_B^0(T)$, by applying multiplicative reduction factors corresponding to the two specified physical mechanisms.\n\n1.  **Baseline Diffusion**: In the absence of carbon, the boron diffusion coefficient is given by the standard Arrhenius relation, which describes a thermally activated process:\n    $$D_B^0(T) = D_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n    Here, $E_a$ is the activation energy for the diffusion process, $D_0$ is the pre-exponential factor, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\n2.  **Interstitial Trapping**: Boron diffusion in silicon is primarily mediated by silicon self-interstitials ($I$). The diffusion coefficient is proportional to the concentration of these mobile point defects. The presence of substitutional carbon ($C_s$) provides traps for interstitials through reactions like $C_s + I \\rightleftharpoons C_sI$. According to the law of mass action, this trapping reduces the equilibrium concentration of free interstitials available to assist boron diffusion. A standard model for such a reduction in the fraction of free species is a factor of the form $(1 + k_{CI}[C_s])^{-1}$, where $[C_s]$ is the substitutional carbon concentration and $k_{CI}$ is an equilibrium-like constant representing the trapping strength. This leads to the first reduction factor, $R_I$:\n    $$R_I([C_s]) = \\frac{1}{1 + k_{CI} [C_s]}$$\n\n3.  **Boron-Carbon Complex Formation**: A second mechanism for diffusion suppression is the deactivation of boron atoms themselves. Mobile substitutional boron ($B_s$) can react with carbon to form immobile complexes, such as through the reaction $B_s + C_s \\rightleftharpoons (BC)_{\\text{immobile}}$. This reduces the concentration of mobile boron atoms relative to the total boron concentration. The diffusion coefficient in Fick's law applies to the mobile species. If we consider an effective diffusion coefficient for the total boron population, it must be scaled by the fraction of boron that remains mobile. Similar to the interstitial trapping, a mass-action model for this process yields a reduction factor $R_{BC}$ dependent on a parameter $K_{BC}$:\n    $$R_{BC}([C_s]) = \\frac{1}{1 + K_{BC} [C_s]}$$\n\n4.  **Combined Model**: The problem states that both effects multiplicatively reduce the effective diffusion coefficient. Therefore, we combine the baseline Arrhenius expression with both reduction factors:\n    $$D_B(T, [C_s]; k_{CI}, K_{BC}) = \\frac{D_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{k_B T}\\right)}{(1 + k_{CI} [C_s])(1 + K_{BC} [C_s])}$$\n    As required, this expression is strictly positive for all physically relevant inputs ($T>0$, $[C_s] \\ge 0$, $k_{CI}>0$, $K_{BC}>0$).\n\n#### Synthetic Data Generation\nThe synthetic data generation follows the procedure specified. For each point $(T_i, [C_s]_i)$ on the experimental grid and for each test case with true parameters $(k_{CI}^\\star, K_{BC}^\\star)$ and noise level $\\sigma$:\n1.  The \"true\" diffusion coefficient $D_{B,i}$ is calculated using the derived model.\n2.  A random value $\\varepsilon_i$ is drawn from a zero-mean normal distribution with standard deviation $\\sigma$, i.e., $\\varepsilon_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$.\n3.  The \"observed\" diffusion coefficient $D_{\\mathrm{obs},i}$ is computed as $D_{\\mathrm{obs},i} = D_{B,i} \\exp(\\varepsilon_i)$. This constitutes log-normal multiplicative noise. The specified random seeds ensure reproducibility.\n\n#### Cost Function Justification\nThe specified cost function for parameter calibration is the sum of squared residuals in logarithmic space:\n$$J(k_{CI},K_{BC}) = \\sum_i \\left[ \\ln D_B(T_i,[C_s]_i; k_{CI}, K_{BC}) - \\ln D_{\\mathrm{obs},i} \\right]^2$$\nThis choice is appropriate for several critical reasons:\n1.  **Error-in-Variables Transformation**: The data generation model is $D_{\\text{obs}} = D_B \\exp(\\varepsilon)$. By taking the natural logarithm, this multiplicative model is transformed into an additive one: $\\ln D_{\\text{obs}} = \\ln D_B + \\varepsilon$. Since the noise term $\\varepsilon$ is assumed to be Gaussian, the transformed model perfectly matches the assumptions of the ordinary least squares (OLS) method. Minimizing the sum of squared residuals in this log space is therefore the maximum likelihood estimator for the parameters $(k_{CI}, K_{BC})$.\n2.  **Linearization of Arrhenius Term**: Taking the logarithm transforms the exponential Arrhenius term $\\exp(-E_a/k_B T)$ into a linear term $-E_a/k_B T$. This transformation often improves the numerical conditioning of the optimization problem.\n3.  **Homoscedasticity and Dynamic Range**: Diffusion coefficients vary by many orders of magnitude. A least-squares fit on the linear scale would be overwhelmingly dominated by the data points with the largest absolute values. By fitting the logarithm, we are minimizing the sum of squared *relative* errors, giving equal weight to all data points regardless of their magnitude, which is physically more meaningful.\n\n#### Numerical Optimization Procedure\nThe task is to find the parameter estimates $(\\hat{k}_{CI}, \\hat{K}_{BC})$ that minimize the cost function $J$ subject to the positivity constraints $k_{CI} > 0$ and $K_{BC} > 0$.\n\n1.  **Constraint Handling via Parameter Transformation**: A robust method to enforce positivity constraints is to perform a change of variables. We define new parameters $p_1 = \\ln(k_{CI})$ and $p_2 = \\ln(K_{BC})$. These new parameters, $(p_1, p_2)$, are unconstrained.\n2.  **Unconstrained Minimization**: The cost function is re-expressed in terms of the new parameters:\n    $$J(p_1, p_2) = \\sum_i \\left[ \\ln D_B(T_i,[C_s]_i; e^{p_1}, e^{p_2}) - \\ln D_{\\mathrm{obs},i} \\right]^2$$\n    This unconstrained nonlinear optimization problem can be solved with a standard numerical optimizer, such as the Nelder-Mead or BFGS algorithm.\n3.  **Parameter Recovery**: After the optimization converges to the optimal log-parameters $(\\hat{p}_1, \\hat{p}_2)$, the estimates for the original parameters are recovered by applying the inverse transformation (exponentiation):\n    $$\\hat{k}_{CI} = \\exp(\\hat{p}_1)$$\n    $$\\hat{K}_{BC} = \\exp(\\hat{p}_2)$$\nThis procedure ensures that the resulting parameter estimates are always positive and is generally numerically stable.",

            "introduction": "A critical test of any scientific model is its predictive power in new, related scenarios. This final practice is designed to validate the core physical assumption of our model: that carbon's primary role is to interact with self-interstitials. We shift our focus from boron, an interstitial-mediated diffuser, to arsenic, a dopant known to diffuse predominantly via vacancies. By applying your understanding, you will predict and confirm that carbon co-implantation has a minimal impact on arsenic diffusion, thereby providing strong evidence for the interstitial-specific nature of the suppression mechanism .",
            "id": "4112358",
            "problem": "Consider arsenic diffusion in crystalline silicon during a thermal anneal with and without carbon co-implantation. The physical transport of the arsenic concentration $C_{\\mathrm{As}}(x,t)$ along one spatial dimension is governed by Fick's second law, which for a spatially uniform effective diffusivity $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ reduces to a linear diffusion equation. For a localized near-surface source evolving under a constant $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, the root-mean-square diffusion length obeys $L_{\\mathrm{rms}}(t) = \\sqrt{2 D_{\\mathrm{eff}} t}$. In dopant diffusion by point-defect mediation, two channels contribute: vacancy-mediated and interstitial-mediated pair diffusion. Let the vacancy-mediated contribution fraction be $\\alpha \\in [0,1]$ and the interstitial-mediated fraction be $1 - \\alpha$. The effect of carbon co-implantation is modeled via interstitial trapping that reduces the free interstitial population; in the dilute trapping limit this is captured by the relation $N_I(C) = N_{I0} / (1 + K C)$, where $C$ is the carbon concentration, $K$ is an effective trapping coefficient, and $N_I$ denotes the free interstitial population. The vacancy-mediated process is assumed unaffected by carbon. Both vacancy-mediated and interstitial-mediated pair diffusivities follow Arrhenius temperature dependence with physically reasonable parameters.\n\nStarting from Fick's second law, Arrhenius scaling for diffusivities, and mass action for point-defect trapping, derive an algorithm to predict the fractional change in $L_{\\mathrm{rms}}$ caused by carbon co-implantation at a given temperature and anneal time. The fractional change quantity to compare is the dimensionless quantity $\\Delta_L = (L_{\\mathrm{rms}}^{(C)} - L_{\\mathrm{rms}}^{(0)}) / L_{\\mathrm{rms}}^{(0)}$, where the superscripts $(C)$ and $(0)$ denote with and without carbon, respectively. You must then compare the magnitude $\\lvert \\Delta_L \\rvert$ against an experimentally measured minimal change bound (treated as an upper bound on $\\lvert \\Delta_L \\rvert$) to infer whether the observation is consistent with predominantly vacancy-mediated diffusion. Report a boolean for each case: return $\\mathrm{True}$ if $\\lvert \\Delta_L \\rvert \\leq m$ and $\\mathrm{False}$ otherwise, where $m$ is the measured minimal change bound given as a decimal (not a percentage).\n\nUse the following physically plausible constants in your algorithm:\n- Boltzmann constant $k_B = 8.617\\,333\\,262\\,145 \\times 10^{-5}$ electron-volts per Kelvin (eV/K).\n- Vacancy-mediated Arrhenius parameters: pre-exponential $D_{0,V} = 2.0$ square-centimeters per second (cm$^2$/s), activation energy $E_V = 3.1$ electron-volts (eV).\n- Interstitial-mediated Arrhenius parameters: pre-exponential $D_{0,I} = 0.5$ cm$^2$/s, activation energy $E_I = 3.6$ eV.\n- Interstitial trapping coefficient $K = 2.0 \\times 10^{-20}$ cubic-centimeters (cm$^3$).\n\nDefine $D_V(T)$ and $D_I(T)$ from Arrhenius expressions with the above constants. Construct $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ at a given temperature $T$ and carbon concentration $C$ using the physically motivated weighting by $\\alpha$ for the vacancy channel and by $1 - \\alpha$ for the interstitial channel, with the interstitial term reduced according to the trapping law. The One-Dimensional (1D) prediction for $L_{\\mathrm{rms}}$ at anneal time $t$ must be computed in centimeters (cm), but the final comparison is dimensionless, and the program output must be booleans.\n\nYour program must implement this logic and evaluate the following test suite. Each test case is a tuple $(T, t, C, m, \\alpha)$ with:\n- $T$ in Kelvin (K),\n- $t$ in seconds (s),\n- $C$ in inverse cubic centimeters (cm$^{-3}$),\n- $m$ as a decimal upper bound on the magnitude of the fractional change,\n- $\\alpha$ dimensionless.\n\nTest suite:\n1. $(1100,\\; 3600,\\; 5.0 \\times 10^{19},\\; 0.02,\\; 0.9)$: a typical high-temperature anneal with moderate carbon; arsenic is expected to be vacancy dominated, so carbon should minimally affect diffusion.\n2. $(1100,\\; 3600,\\; 0.0,\\; 0.0,\\; 0.9)$: no carbon; the predicted fractional change must be zero.\n3. $(1200,\\; 7200,\\; 5.0 \\times 10^{19},\\; 0.005,\\; 0.9)$: higher temperature and longer anneal with carbon; vacancy dominance should still limit changes.\n4. $(1100,\\; 3600,\\; 5.0 \\times 10^{19},\\; 0.0001,\\; 0.6)$: same thermal conditions as case 1 but with a smaller vacancy fraction to probe sensitivity; interstitial reduction by carbon may become more noticeable.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (e.g., \"[result1,result2,result3,result4]\"), where each result is either True or False as defined above.",
            "solution": "The objective is to derive an algorithm to compute the fractional change in the root-mean-square (RMS) diffusion length of arsenic in silicon due to carbon co-implantation, and to compare this change against a given tolerance. The RMS diffusion length is given by $L_{\\mathrm{rms}}(t) = \\sqrt{2 D_{\\mathrm{eff}} t}$, where $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is the effective diffusivity and $t$ is the anneal time. The analysis hinges on correctly modeling $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ with and without carbon.\n\nFirst, we establish the component diffusivities. The problem states that arsenic diffusion is mediated by both vacancies and self-interstitials. The respective diffusivities, $D_V(T)$ and $D_I(T)$, follow the Arrhenius law:\n$$D(T) = D_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_A}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $T$ is the absolute temperature, $D_0$ is the pre-exponential factor, $E_A$ is the activation energy, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant ($k_B = 8.617333262145 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\mathrm{eV/K}$). Using the provided parameters:\n- Vacancy-mediated diffusivity: $D_V(T) = D_{0,V} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_V}{k_B T}\\right)$, with $D_{0,V} = 2.0 \\, \\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{s}$ and $E_V = 3.1 \\, \\mathrm{eV}$.\n- Intrinsic interstitial-mediated diffusivity: $D_I(T) = D_{0,I} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_I}{k_B T}\\right)$, with $D_{0,I} = 0.5 \\, \\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{s}$ and $E_I = 3.6 \\, \\mathrm{eV}$.\n\nNext, we construct the effective diffusivity, $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. The problem specifies that the overall diffusion process is a combination of these two channels, with the vacancy-mediated fraction being $\\alpha$ and the interstitial-mediated fraction being $1 - \\alpha$.\n\nIn the absence of carbon (denoted by superscript $(0)$), the effective diffusivity is a weighted sum of the two components:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{(0)}(T, \\alpha) = \\alpha D_V(T) + (1-\\alpha) D_I(T)$$\n\nIn the presence of carbon (denoted by superscript $(C)$), the vacancy-mediated channel is unaffected. However, carbon traps interstitials, reducing their free population. The problem provides a trapping model, $N_I(C) = N_{I0} / (1 + K C)$, where $N_I(C)$ is the free interstitial population at carbon concentration $C$, $N_{I0}$ is the intrinsic population, and $K$ is the trapping coefficient ($K = 2.0 \\times 10^{-20} \\, \\mathrm{cm}^3$). Since the interstitial-mediated diffusivity is directly proportional to the free interstitial population, it is suppressed by the same factor. The effective diffusivity in the presence of carbon is therefore:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{(C)}(T, C, \\alpha) = \\alpha D_V(T) + (1-\\alpha) \\frac{D_I(T)}{1 + KC}$$\n\nThe core quantity to be calculated is the fractional change in the RMS diffusion length, $\\Delta_L$:\n$$\\Delta_L = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{rms}}^{(C)} - L_{\\mathrm{rms}}^{(0)}}{L_{\\mathrm{rms}}^{(0)}}$$\nSubstituting the formula for $L_{\\mathrm{rms}}$:\n$$\\Delta_L = \\frac{\\sqrt{2 D_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{(C)} t} - \\sqrt{2 D_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{(0)} t}}{\\sqrt{2 D_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{(0)} t}}$$\nThe term $\\sqrt{2t}$ cancels, revealing that the fractional change is independent of the anneal time $t$:\n$$\\Delta_L = \\frac{\\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{(C)}} - \\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{(0)}}}{\\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{(0)}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{(C)}}{D_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{(0)}}} - 1$$\nThis is the final expression for the fractional change. Substituting the models for $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{(C)}$ and $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{(0)}$:\n$$\\Delta_L(T, C, \\alpha) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha D_V(T) + (1-\\alpha) \\frac{D_I(T)}{1 + KC}}{\\alpha D_V(T) + (1-\\alpha) D_I(T)}} - 1$$\n\nThe final step is to evaluate the boolean condition $\\lvert \\Delta_L \\rvert \\leq m$ for each test case, where $m$ is the given minimal change bound.\n\nThe computational algorithm for each test case $(T, t, C, m, \\alpha)$ is as follows:\n1. Calculate the product $k_B T$.\n2. Calculate $D_V(T)$ and $D_I(T)$ using their Arrhenius expressions.\n3. Calculate $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{(0)} = \\alpha D_V(T) + (1-\\alpha) D_I(T)$.\n4. Calculate the interstitial suppression factor $S = 1 / (1 + KC)$.\n5. Calculate $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{(C)} = \\alpha D_V(T) + (1-\\alpha) D_I(T) \\cdot S$.\n6. Compute the ratio $R = D_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{(C)} / D_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{(0)}$.\n7. Calculate $\\Delta_L = \\sqrt{R} - 1$.\n8. Determine the boolean result of the comparison $\\lvert \\Delta_L \\rvert \\leq m$.",
