The problem is scientifically grounded in the established Poisson model for defect-limited yield, is well-posed with all necessary parameters provided, and is formulated objectively. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem states that random defects are modeled as a homogeneous spatial Poisson point process. For such a process, the number of defects, $N$, occurring in a fixed area $A$ follows a Poisson distribution with a probability mass function given by:\n$$P(N=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^{k} \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}$$\nwhere $k$ is the number of defects (a non-negative integer) and $\\lambda$ is the average number of defects in the area $A$. The parameter $\\lambda$ is calculated as the product of the defect density, $D$, and the area, $A$:\n$$\\lambda = A D$$\n\nA die is considered functionally good if and only if it contains zero defects.

The die area $A$ is given in $\\text{mm}^2$ and the defect density $D_0$ is in defects per $\\text{cm}^2$. We convert the area to $\\text{cm}^2$.\n    Since $1\\ \\text{cm} = 10\\ \\text{mm}$, it follows that $1\\ \\text{cm}^2 = (10\\ \\text{mm})^2 = 100\\ \\text{mm}^2$.\n    Therefore, the die area in $\\text{cm}^2$ is:\n    $$A = 50\\ \\text{mm}^2 \\times \\frac{1\\ \\text{cm}^2}{100\\ \\text{mm}^2} = 0.5\\ \\text{cm}^2$$\n\n    Next, we derive the functional yield for the simple Poisson model, $Y_{\\text{P}}$. This model assumes a constant defect density equal to the nominal density, $D = D_0$. The yield is the probability of zero defects, given by the provided formula:\n    $$Y_{\\text{P}} = P(N=0) = \\exp(-D_0 A)$$\n    The product $D_0 A$ represents the expected number of defects on the die under this model. Let's call this $\\lambda_0$.\n    $$\\lambda_0 = D_0 A = (0.1\\ \\text{defects}/\\text{cm}^2) \\times (0.5\\ \\text{cm}^2) = 0.05$$\n    So, the Poisson yield is:\n    $$Y_{\\text{P}} = \\exp(-0.05)$$\n\n    Now, we derive the functional yield for the defect clustering model, $Y_{\\text{NB}}$. This is also known as the negative binomial model because the resulting distribution of defect counts per die is a negative binomial distribution. The yield is the unconditional probability of having zero defects, calculated by taking the expectation of the conditional probability over the distribution of the defect density $D$.\n    $$Y_{\\text{NB}} = P(N=0) = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(-D A)]$$\n    The expectation is an integral over all possible values of the defect density $d$, weighted by its probability density function $f_D(d)$:\n    $$Y_{\\text{NB}} = \\int_0^\\infty \\exp(-d A) f_D(d) \\, dd$$\n    Substituting the Gamma PDF for $f_D(d)$:\n    $$Y_{\\text{NB}} = \\int_0^\\infty \\exp(-d A) \\left( \\frac{\\beta^{\\alpha}}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)} d^{\\alpha-1} \\exp(-\\beta d) \\right) \\, dd$$\n    We can combine the exponential terms and factor out the constants:\n    $$Y_{\\text{NB}} = \\frac{\\beta^{\\alpha}}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)} \\int_0^\\infty d^{\\alpha-1} \\exp(-(\\beta + A) d) \\, dd$$\n    The integral is a standard form. We recognize it as being related to the Gamma function. The integral $\\int_0^\\infty x^{k-1} \\exp(-ax) \\, dx = \\frac{\\Gamma(k)}{a^k}$. In our case, $k = \\alpha$ and $a = \\beta + A$.\n    So, the integral evaluates to $\\frac{\\Gamma(\\alpha)}{(\\beta+A)^{\\alpha}}$.\n    Substituting this back into the expression for $Y_{\\text{NB}}$:\n    $$Y_{\\text{NB}} = \\frac{\\beta^{\\alpha}}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)} \\cdot \\frac{\\Gamma(\\alpha)}{(\\beta+A)^{\\alpha}} = \\left(\\frac{\\beta}{\\beta+A}\\right)^{\\alpha} = \\left(1 + \\frac{A}{\\beta}\\right)^{-\\alpha}$$\n    To express this in terms of the given parameters $D_0$, $A$, and $\\alpha$, we use the relation $\\mathbb{E}[D] = D_0 = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}$, which implies $\\beta = \\frac{\\alpha}{D_0}$.\n    Substituting for $\\beta$:\n    $$Y_{\\text{NB}} = \\left(1 + \\frac{A}{\\alpha/D_0}\\right)^{-\\alpha} = \\left(1 + \\frac{D_0 A}{\\alpha}\\right)^{-\\alpha}$$\n    This is the final expression for the yield under the negative binomial model.\n\n    We are given $\\alpha = 2$ and we have computed $D_0 A = 0.05$. Substituting these values:\n    $$Y_{\\text{NB}} = \\left(1 + \\frac{0.05}{2}\\right)^{-2} = (1 + 0.025)^{-2} = (1.025)^{-2}$$\n\n    Finally, we compute the relative percentage difference, $\\delta$:\n    $$\\delta = \\frac{Y_{\\text{NB}} - Y_{\\text{P}}}{Y_{\\text{P}}} = \\frac{Y_{\\text{NB}}}{Y_{\\text{P}}} - 1$$\n    Substituting the expressions for $Y_{\\text{P}}$ and $Y_{\\text{NB}}$:\n    $$\\delta = \\frac{(1.025)^{-2}}{\\exp(-0.05)} - 1$$\n    Now we compute the numerical values:\n    $$Y_{\\text{P}} = \\exp(-0.05) \\approx 0.9512294245$$\n    $$Y_{\\text{NB}} = (1.025)^{-2} = \\frac{1}{1.050625} \\approx 0.9518143979$$\n    Plugging these into the formula for $\\delta$:\n    $$\\delta = \\frac{0.9518143979}{0.9512294245} - 1 \\approx 1.0006150100 - 1 = 0.0006150100$$\n    The problem asks for the answer to be rounded to six significant figures. The first significant figure is the $6$ in the fourth decimal place. Counting six figures from there gives $6, 1, 5, 0, 1, 0$.

The provided physical parameters and statistical data are realistic. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution is provided below.\n\nThe objective is to derive the first-order probability distribution of the Static Noise Margin ($\\mathrm{SNM}$) of a Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) cell, given small, normally distributed variations in underlying transistor parameters, and then to calculate the probability that the $\\mathrm{SNM}$ exceeds a certain threshold $T$.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in three stages: first, establishing the functional dependence of $\\mathrm{SNM}$ on device parameters; second, linearizing this dependence and deriving the resulting statistical distribution of $\\mathrm{SNM}$; and third, formulating the probability of exceeding a threshold $T$.\n\n1.  **Functional Dependence of SNM on Device Parameters**\n\nThe SRAM cell consists of two cross-coupled CMOS inverters. The static behavior of this cell is captured by the \"butterfly curve,\" which is an overlay of the voltage transfer characteristic (VTC) of one inverter and the inverse VTC of the other. The $\\mathrm{SNM}$ is geometrically defined as the side length of the largest possible square that can be inscribed within the lobes of this butterfly curve.\n\nThe VTC of a single CMOS inverter, which plots output voltage $V_{out}$ versus input voltage $V_{in}$, is determined by the condition of current equality between its n-channel MOSFET (NMOS) and p-channel MOSFET (PMOS) transistors: $I_{D,n} = I_{D,p}$. The drain currents are given by the device equations:\n$$I_{D,n} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W_n}{L_{\\text{eff},n}} (V_{GS,n} - V_{T,n})^2$$\n$$I_{D,p} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_p C_{ox} \\frac{W_p}{L_{\\text{eff},p}} (V_{SG,p} - |V_{T,p}|)^2$$\nThese equations hold in the saturation region, which is critical for determining the transition region of the inverter. The specific shape of the VTC, and thus the shape of the butterfly curve and the value of the $\\mathrm{SNM}$, is a complex, non-linear function of the transistor parameters. Let us define a vector of these process parameters, $\\mathbf{p} \\in \\mathbb{R}^6$:\n$$\\mathbf{p} = [V_{T,n}, V_{T,p}, \\ln \\mu_n, \\ln \\mu_p, \\ln L_{\\text{eff},n}, \\ln L_{\\text{eff},p}]^\\top$$\nThe dependence can thus be formally written as $\\mathrm{SNM} = f(\\mathbf{p})$. The exact analytical form of $f(\\mathbf{p})$ is intractable, but its existence is a direct consequence of the device physics.\n\n2.  **Linearization and Statistical Distribution of SNM**\n\nProcess variations cause the parameter vector $\\mathbf{p}$ to deviate from its nominal value $\\mathbf{p}_0$. Let this deviation be denoted by the random vector $\\Delta \\mathbf{p} = \\mathbf{p} - \\mathbf{p}_0$. For small perturbations, the function $f(\\mathbf{p})$ can be approximated by a first-order Taylor series expansion around the nominal point $\\mathbf{p}_0$:\n$$\\mathrm{SNM}(\\mathbf{p}) \\approx f(\\mathbf{p}_0) + \\left. \\nabla_{\\mathbf{p}} f \\right|_{\\mathbf{p}_0} (\\mathbf{p} - \\mathbf{p}_0)$$\nHere, $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{p}} f$ is the gradient of the $\\mathrm{SNM}$ function with respect to the parameters. The problem provides the nominal $\\mathrm{SNM}$, $\\mathrm{SNM}_0 = f(\\mathbf{p}_0)$, and the sensitivity vector $\\mathbf{s}$, which is the transpose of the gradient evaluated at the nominal point:\n$$\\mathbf{s} = \\left. (\\nabla_{\\mathbf{p}} f)^\\top \\right|_{\\mathbf{p}_0} = \\left[\\frac{\\partial \\mathrm{SNM}}{\\partial p_1}, \\dots, \\frac{\\partial \\mathrm{SNM}}{\\partial p_6}\\right]^\\top$$\nThe linearized model for $\\mathrm{SNM}$ is therefore:\n$$\\mathrm{SNM} \\approx \\mathrm{SNM}_0 + \\mathbf{s}^\\top \\Delta \\mathbf{p}$$\nThe problem states that the parameter perturbations follow a zero-mean multivariate normal distribution, $\\Delta \\mathbf{p} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0}, \\Sigma)$, where $\\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix.\n\nThe $\\mathrm{SNM}$, under this linear approximation, is an affine transformation of a multivariate normal random vector. A fundamental property of the normal distribution is that any such transformation results in a normally distributed random variable. Thus, $\\mathrm{SNM}$ is approximately normally distributed, $\\mathrm{SNM} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{\\mathrm{SNM}}, \\sigma_{\\mathrm{SNM}}^2)$. We now determine its mean $\\mu_{\\mathrm{SNM}}$ and variance $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{SNM}}^2$.\n\nThe mean is found by taking the expectation of the linearized expression:\n$$\\mu_{\\mathrm{SNM}} = E[\\mathrm{SNM}] \\approx E[\\mathrm{SNM}_0 + \\mathbf{s}^\\top \\Delta \\mathbf{p}] = \\mathrm{SNM}_0 + \\mathbf{s}^\\top E[\\Delta \\mathbf{p}]$$\nSince $E[\\Delta \\mathbf{p}] = \\mathbf{0}$, the mean of $\\mathrm{SNM}$ is its nominal value:\n$$\\mu_{\\mathrm{SNM}} = \\mathrm{SNM}_0$$\n\nThe variance is found using the properties of variances of linear combinations of random variables:\n$$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{SNM}}^2 = \\mathrm{Var}(\\mathrm{SNM}) \\approx \\mathrm{Var}(\\mathrm{SNM}_0 + \\mathbf{s}^\\top \\Delta \\mathbf{p}) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\mathbf{s}^\\top \\Delta \\mathbf{p})$$\nFor a random vector $\\mathbf{X}$ with covariance matrix $\\mathrm{Cov}(\\mathbf{X})$ and a constant vector $\\mathbf{a}$, the variance of $\\mathbf{a}^\\top \\mathbf{X}$ is $\\mathbf{a}^\\top \\mathrm{Cov}(\\mathbf{X}) \\mathbf{a}$. Applying this rule:\n$$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{SNM}}^2 = \\mathbf{s}^\\top \\mathrm{Cov}(\\Delta \\mathbf{p}) \\mathbf{s} = \\mathbf{s}^\\top \\Sigma \\mathbf{s}$$\nThus, the first-order distribution of $\\mathrm{SNM}$ is $\\mathcal{N}(\\mathrm{SNM}_0, \\mathbf{s}^\\top \\Sigma \\mathbf{s})$.\n\n3.  **Probability Calculation**\n\nWe need to compute the probability that $\\mathrm{SNM}$ exceeds a specified threshold $T$, i.e., $P(\\mathrm{SNM}  T)$. To do this, we standardize the normal random variable $\\mathrm{SNM}$ to obtain a standard normal variable $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$:\n$$Z = \\frac{\\mathrm{SNM} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{SNM}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{SNM}}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{SNM} - \\mathrm{SNM}_0}{\\sqrt{\\mathbf{s}^\\top \\Sigma \\mathbf{s}}}$$\nThe probability can now be expressed in terms of $Z$:\n$$P(\\mathrm{SNM}  T) = P\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{SNM} - \\mathrm{SNM}_0}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{SNM}}}  \\frac{T - \\mathrm{SNM}_0}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{SNM}}}\\right) = P\\left(Z  \\frac{T - \\mathrm{SNM}_0}{\\sqrt{\\mathbf{s}^\\top \\Sigma \\mathbf{s}}}\\right)$$\nLet $\\Phi(z)$ be the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution, $\\Phi(z) = P(Z \\le z)$. The survival function (or complementary CDF) is $P(Z  z) = 1 - \\Phi(z)$. Therefore, the desired probability is:\n$$P(\\mathrm{SNM}  T) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{T - \\mathrm{SNM}_0}{\\sqrt{\\mathbf{s}^\\top \\Sigma \\mathbf{s}}}\\right)$$\nUsing the identity $1 - \\Phi(z) = \\Phi(-z)$, this can also be written as:\n$$P(\\mathrm{SNM}  T) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{SNM}_0 - T}{\\sqrt{\\mathbf{s}^\\top \\Sigma \\mathbf{s}}}\\right)$$\nThis final expression will be implemented to solve the test cases. The covariance matrix $\\Sigma$ must be constructed from the given standard deviations $\\sigma_i$ and correlation coefficients $\\rho_{ij}$ using the relations $\\Sigma_{ii} = \\sigma_i^2$ and $\\Sigma_{ij} = \\rho_{ij} \\sigma_i \\sigma_j$ for $i \\neq j$.",
