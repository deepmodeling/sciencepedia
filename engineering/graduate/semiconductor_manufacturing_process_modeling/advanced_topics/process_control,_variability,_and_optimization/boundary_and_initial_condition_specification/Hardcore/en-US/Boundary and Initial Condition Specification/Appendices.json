This first exercise provides practice in this fundamental skill by analyzing a classic steady-state heat transfer scenario in a silicon wafer .

            "problem": "A monocrystalline silicon wafer used in Rapid Thermal Processing (RTP) is modeled as a one-dimensional slab of thickness $L$, with constant thermal conductivity $k$. The wafer is subjected to a uniform, specified radiative heat flux density $q''_{0}$ applied at the back surface $x=0$ (directed into the wafer), while the front surface at $x=L$ exchanges heat with a flowing purge gas at ambient temperature $T_{\\infty}$ via convection characterized by a heat transfer coefficient $h$. Assume no internal volumetric heat generation, negligible radiation exchange at the front surface, and steady-state conditions.\n\nStarting from conservation of energy for steady heat conduction and the constitutive laws for thermal transport, pose the appropriate boundary conditions that reflect the physical situation described, and derive the steady-state temperature profile $T(x)$ within the slab.\n\nYour derivation must begin from first principles consistent with semiconductor manufacturing process modeling and must identify how the boundary mechanisms can be interpreted as thermal resistances. Express your final temperature profile $T(x)$ in closed form in terms of $q''_{0}$, $h$, $k$, $L$, and $T_{\\infty}$, and provide it as the final answer. No numerical values are needed. The final answer must be a single analytic expression.",
            "solution": "The physical situation is a one-dimensional, steady heat conduction problem through a slab representing a silicon wafer. The fundamental base consists of the following laws and definitions:\n\n- Conservation of energy for steady, one-dimensional conduction with no internal volumetric heat generation implies that the temperature field $T(x)$ satisfies\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}T}{dx^{2}}=0.\n$$\n- Fourier's law of heat conduction relates the conductive heat flux $q''_{\\text{cond}}(x)$ to the temperature gradient:\n$$\nq''_{\\text{cond}}(x) = -k\\,\\frac{dT}{dx},\n$$\nwith $k$ the thermal conductivity of the solid, taken as constant.\n- Newton's law of cooling relates the convective heat flux at the boundary to the temperature difference across the fluid-solid interface:\n$$\nq''_{\\text{conv}} = h\\left(T_{\\text{surface}}-T_{\\infty}\\right).\n$$\n\nThe differential equation $\\frac{d^{2}T}{dx^{2}}=0$ integrates twice to give a linear temperature profile,\n$$\nT(x) = A x + B,\n$$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants to be determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nWe now specify the boundary conditions. For steady state, the heat flux must be constant throughout the slab.\nAt the back surface, $x=0$, a uniform heat flux $q''_{0}$ is applied into the wafer. This flux is directed in the positive $x$-direction, so it must equal the conductive heat flux through the slab:\n$$\nq''_{\\text{cond}} = q''_{0} \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad -k\\,\\frac{dT}{dx} = q''_{0}.\n$$\nSince $\\frac{dT}{dx} = A$ for the linear profile, this determines the constant $A$:\n$$\nA = -\\frac{q''_{0}}{k}.\n$$\nAt the front surface, $x=L$, the conductive heat flux arriving at the surface must be carried away by convection. Therefore, the conductive flux must equal the convective flux:\n$$\nq''_{\\text{cond}} = q''_{\\text{conv}} \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad q''_{0} = h\\left(T(L)-T_{\\infty}\\right).\n$$\nThis condition allows us to determine the temperature at the front surface, $T(L)$:\n$$\nT(L) = T_{\\infty} + \\frac{q''_{0}}{h}.\n$$\nNow we use this result to find the constant $B$. By evaluating the general solution $T(x) = Ax+B$ at $x=L$:\n$$\nT(L) = A L + B = \\left(-\\frac{q''_{0}}{k}\\right)L + B.\n$$\nSetting the two expressions for $T(L)$ equal allows us to solve for $B$:\n$$\nT_{\\infty} + \\frac{q''_{0}}{h} = -\\frac{q''_{0}}{k}L + B \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad B = T_{\\infty} + \\frac{q''_{0}}{h} + \\frac{q''_{0}L}{k}.\n$$\nThe steady-state temperature profile is therefore\n$$\nT(x) = A x + B = -\\frac{q''_{0}}{k}\\,x + T_{\\infty} + \\frac{q''_{0}}{h} + \\frac{q''_{0} L}{k}.\n$$\nThis can be rearranged to a more interpretable form:\n$$\nT(x) = T_{\\infty} + q''_{0}\\left(\\frac{1}{h} + \\frac{L-x}{k}\\right).\n$$\n\nTo interpret the role of boundary resistances, note that the temperature rise above ambient at any position $x$ can be written as a product of the heat flux $q''_{0}$ and an effective thermal resistance between position $x$ and the ambient fluid:\n$$\nT(x) - T_{\\infty} = q''_{0}\\left(R_{\\text{conv}} + R_{\\text{cond}}(x\\to L)\\right),\n$$\nwhere $R_{\\text{conv}} = \\frac{1}{h}$ represents the convective boundary resistance at $x=L$, and $R_{\\text{cond}}(x\\to L) = \\frac{L-x}{k}$ represents the conductive resistance of the slab segment from position $x$ to $L$. These resistances add in series, reinforcing the view that boundary mechanisms can be modeled as resistances that determine the temperature field.\n\nNo initial condition is needed because the problem is steady-state; the solution is fully determined by the two boundary conditions and the governing equation.",

            "problem": "A silicon wafer is subjected to a thermal oxidation step that consumes an interstitial dopant at the surface with first-order kinetics. The dopant concentration $C(x,t)$ in the wafer interior, idealized as a semi-infinite domain $x \\geq 0$, evolves by Fick's second law of diffusion with a constant diffusion coefficient $D$. The surface reaction at $x=0$ imposes the reactive flux boundary condition $-D \\partial_{n} C = k_{s} C$, where $\\partial_{n}$ denotes the outward normal derivative at the surface and $k_{s}$ is the surface reaction rate constant. Prior to the onset of oxidation at $t=0$, the wafer is uniformly doped, so the initial condition is $C(x,0)=C_{0}$ for all $x \\geq 0$.\n\nBecause the uniform initial condition implies zero gradient at the surface while the reactive boundary condition demands a nonzero flux proportional to $C_{0}$ at $t=0^{+}$, an initial condition mismatch must be resolved by the rapid formation of a thin diffusion boundary layer near $x=0$. Focusing on the early-time regime $t \\to 0^{+}$, use a scaling analysis based on fundamental diffusion physics and the reactive flux boundary condition to quantify the induced transient in the surface concentration. Specifically:\n\n- Model the near-surface evolution in the limit $t \\to 0^{+}$ by arguing for the appropriate thickness scale of the emerging diffusion boundary layer and estimating the near-surface gradient from conservation considerations.\n- Close the estimate using the reactive flux boundary condition to obtain a leading-order analytic scaling expression for the normalized surface concentration $C(0,t)/C_{0}$ in terms of $D$, $k_{s}$, and $t$.\n\nState and justify any assumptions used in the scaling.

            "solution": "The objective is to linearize a nonlinear boundary condition residual and determine the resulting coefficients for use in a Newton-based numerical solver.
