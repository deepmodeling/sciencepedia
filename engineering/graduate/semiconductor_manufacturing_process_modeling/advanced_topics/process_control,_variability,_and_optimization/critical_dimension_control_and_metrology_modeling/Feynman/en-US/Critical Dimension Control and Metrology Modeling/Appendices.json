This first practice starts with the foundational model of optical lithography, the Rayleigh criterion, which provides a simple yet powerful relationship between critical dimension ($CD$), wavelength ($\\lambda$), and numerical aperture ($NA$). By deriving the sensitivity of the $CD$ to these parameters, you will practice a fundamental skill in process modeling: quantifying how small changes in system inputs propagate to the output, providing crucial insights for process stabilization and control .",

Here, $k_1$ is a dimensionless process factor, $\\lambda$ is the exposure wavelength, and $NA$ is the Numerical Aperture (NA) of the projection system. In metrology modeling, sensitivity coefficients quantify how small changes in input parameters propagate to changes in the measured output.

            "introduction": "A critical dimension is not just an abstract number; it is a measurement taken from a physical feature with a complex three-dimensional shape. This exercise bridges the gap between idealized models and metrology practice by having you model a non-ideal trapezoidal feature profile . You will derive the measured $CD$ based on a standard fractional-height criterion, revealing how the choice of measurement algorithm interacts with the feature's geometry, particularly its sidewall angle, to produce the final reported value.",

            "problem": "A trapezoidal line feature formed in a resist layer exhibits straight, planar sidewalls and a uniform height. Let the top width be $w_{t}$, the bottom width be $w_{b}$, and the feature height be $h$. Define the Critical Dimension (CD) by the fractional-height criterion as the line width measured at a depth $\\alpha h$ below the top surface, where $0<\\alpha<1$. Assume the sidewall angle is well-defined by the deviation from vertical, denoted $\\phi$ (in radians), under the convention that $\\phi=0$ corresponds to perfectly vertical sidewalls and the local half-width increases linearly with depth according to Euclidean geometry. Under these conditions, $\\phi$ is related to the trapezoid geometry by $\\tan\\phi=\\frac{w_{b}-w_{t}}{2h}$.\n\nStarting from geometric first principles and the core definition that a straight sidewall implies a linear change of half-width with depth, derive a closed-form expression for the CD at depth $\\alpha h$ in terms of $w_{t}$, $w_{b}$, $h$, and $\\alpha$, and also express it in terms of $w_{t}$, $h$, $\\alpha$, and $\\phi$.

Express the sensitivity in $\\mathrm{nm}$ per radian and round your final numerical answer to four significant figures. Use radians for the angle unit throughout.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of expressions for the Critical Dimension (CD) of a trapezoidal feature and its sensitivity to the sidewall angle, followed by a numerical evaluation. We shall proceed by establishing a geometric model of the feature.\n\nLet's define a coordinate system where the vertical axis, $z$, originates at the top surface of the feature ($z=0$) and points downwards towards the substrate. The horizontal axis, $x$, is centered on the feature's axis of symmetry. The feature has a uniform height $h$, so its top surface is at $z=0$ and its bottom surface is at $z=h$. The top width is $w_t$ and the bottom width is $w_b$. Due to symmetry, the half-width at the top is $x(0) = \\frac{w_t}{2}$ and the half-width at the bottom is $x(h) = \\frac{w_b}{2}$.\n\nThe problem states that the feature has straight sidewalls, which implies that the half-width, $x(z)$, is a linear function of the depth $z$. A general linear function has the form $x(z) = mz + c$, where $m$ is the slope and $c$ is the intercept.\n\nUsing the condition at the top surface ($z=0$):\n$x(0) = m(0) + c = c$. Since $x(0) = \\frac{w_t}{2}$, the intercept is $c = \\frac{w_t}{2}$.\n\nUsing the condition at the bottom surface ($z=h$):\n$x(h) = mh + c = mh + \\frac{w_t}{2}$. Since $x(h) = \\frac{w_b}{2}$, we can solve for the slope $m$:\n$$mh + \\frac{w_t}{2} = \\frac{w_b}{2}$$\n$$mh = \\frac{w_b - w_t}{2}$$\n$$m = \\frac{w_b - w_t}{2h}$$\nThus, the expression for the half-width at any depth $z$ is:\n$$x(z) = \\left(\\frac{w_b - w_t}{2h}\\right)z + \\frac{w_t}{2}$$\nThe full width of the feature at depth $z$, denoted $w(z)$, is twice the half-width, $w(z) = 2x(z)$:\n$$w(z) = 2\\left[\\left(\\frac{w_b - w_t}{2h}\\right)z + \\frac{w_t}{2}\\right] = \\left(\\frac{w_b - w_t}{h}\\right)z + w_t$$\nThe Critical Dimension (CD) is defined as the width measured at a depth $z = \\alpha h$, where $0 < \\alpha < 1$. Substituting $z = \\alpha h$ into the expression for $w(z)$:\n$$\\mathrm{CD} = w(\\alpha h) = w_t + \\left(\\frac{w_b - w_t}{h}\\right)(\\alpha h)$$\nThe height $h$ cancels, yielding the first required expression for the CD in terms of $w_t$, $w_b$, and $\\alpha$:\n$$\\mathrm{CD} = w_t + \\alpha(w_b - w_t)$$\nThis expression can be rewritten as $\\mathrm{CD} = (1-\\alpha)w_t + \\alpha w_b$, which shows the CD is a linear interpolation between the top and bottom widths.\n\nNext, we express the CD in terms of $w_t$, $h$, $\\alpha$, and the sidewall angle $\\phi$. The problem provides the relationship $\\tan\\phi = \\frac{w_b - w_t}{2h}$. This is consistent with our derived slope $m = \\frac{dx}{dz} = \\tan\\phi$, where $\\phi$ is the angle the sidewall makes with the vertical axis. We rearrange this relationship to solve for the difference in widths:\n$$w_b - w_t = 2h\\tan\\phi$$\nSubstituting this into our first expression for the CD:\n$$\\mathrm{CD} = w_t + \\alpha(2h\\tan\\phi)$$\nThis gives the second required expression for the CD:\n$$\\mathrm{CD} = w_t + 2\\alpha h \\tan\\phi$$\nNow we derive the sensitivity of the CD to variations in the sidewall angle, $S_{\\phi} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathrm{CD}}{\\partial \\phi}$, holding $w_t$ and $h$ constant. We differentiate the second CD expression with respect to $\\phi$:\n$$S_{\\phi} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}\\left(w_t + 2\\alpha h \\tan\\phi\\right)$$\nSince $w_t$, $h$, and $\\alpha$ are treated as constants for this partial derivative:\n$$S_{\\phi} = 0 + 2\\alpha h \\frac{d}{d\\phi}(\\tan\\phi)$$\nThe derivative of $\\tan\\phi$ with respect to $\\phi$ is $\\sec^2\\phi$. Therefore, the sensitivity is:\n$$S_{\\phi} = 2\\alpha h \\sec^2\\phi$$\nFinally, we evaluate $S_{\\phi}$ numerically using the provided parameters: $w_t = 38\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $w_b = 42\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $h = 30\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, and $\\alpha = 0.25$.\nFirst, we calculate $\\tan\\phi$ from the geometry:\n$$\\tan\\phi = \\frac{w_b - w_t}{2h} = \\frac{42\\,\\mathrm{nm} - 38\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{2(30\\,\\mathrm{nm})} = \\frac{4\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{60\\,\\mathrm{nm}} = \\frac{1}{15}$$\nNext, we find $\\sec^2\\phi$ using the trigonometric identity $\\sec^2\\phi = 1 + \\tan^2\\phi$:\n$$\\sec^2\\phi = 1 + \\left(\\frac{1}{15}\\right)^2 = 1 + \\frac{1}{225} = \\frac{225}{225} + \\frac{1}{225} = \\frac{226}{225}$$\nNow, we substitute the known values into the expression for $S_{\\phi}$. The units of $h$ are $\\mathrm{nm}$ and $\\phi$ is in radians, so the result for $S_{\\phi}$ will be in $\\mathrm{nm}/\\mathrm{rad}$.\n$$S_{\\phi} = 2\\alpha h \\sec^2\\phi = 2(0.25)(30) \\left(\\frac{226}{225}\\right)$$\n$$S_{\\phi} = (0.5)(30) \\left(\\frac{226}{225}\\right) = 15 \\left(\\frac{226}{225}\\right)$$\n$$S_{\\phi} = \\frac{226}{15} \\approx 15.0666...$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested:\n$$S_{\\phi} \\approx 15.07$$\nThe sensitivity of the CD to the sidewall angle is approximately $15.07\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ per radian for the given process parameters.",
