            "problem": "A single long interconnect line segment of length $L$ on a semiconductor wafer is susceptible to open-circuit failures caused by randomly occurring circular particulate defects with random radius $r \\ge 0$. Assume defects occur in the plane according to a homogeneous Poisson Point Process (PPP) with mean areal density $D$ (defects per unit area), and that the defect radius $r$ for each defect is independent and identically distributed with probability density function $p(r) = \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda r)$ for $r \\ge 0$, where $\\lambda  0$ is the rate parameter of the exponential distribution. For a narrow interconnect line whose width is small compared to the defect sizes of interest, the open-failure critical area for a defect of radius $r$ can be approximated by the geometric corridor model\n$$A_c^{\\text{open}}(r) = 2 r L,$$\nwhich represents the measure of defect-center locations that would sever the line. Ignoring end effects and assuming linear superposition of independent fatal-defect risks, derive from first principles the analytic expression for the defect-limited yield $Y$ (the probability that the line has zero fatal defects) as a function of $D$, $L$, and $\\lambda$. Express your final answer as a single closed-form expression with no numerical evaluation or rounding.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the defect-limited yield, $Y$, for a long interconnect line subject to failures from randomly located and sized particulate defects. The yield is defined as the probability that the line has zero fatal defects.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from first principles based on the provided models.\n\nFirst, we are given that the defect center locations follow a homogeneous Poisson Point Process (PPP) in the plane with a mean areal density of $D$. A key property of a PPP is that the number of points, $N$, found within any given region of area $A$ is a Poisson-distributed random variable with mean $\\mu = D A$. Thus, the probability of finding $k$ points in that region is given by:\n$$P(N=k) = \\frac{\\mu^k \\exp(-\\mu)}{k!} = \\frac{(DA)^k \\exp(-DA)}{k!}$$\n\nSecond, not every defect is fatal. A defect causes an open-circuit failure only if its center lies within a specific \"critical area\". The problem states that the size of a defect, its radius $r$, is a random variable. The critical area for an open failure, $A_c^{\\text{open}}(r)$, is a function of this random radius $r$. The problem provides this function as:\n$$A_c^{\\text{open}}(r) = 2 r L$$\nwhere $L$ is the length of the interconnect.\n\nThird, the defect radii are themselves random variables, independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) according to an exponential distribution with probability density function (PDF):\n$$p(r) = \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda r) \\quad \\text{for } r \\ge 0$$\nwhere $\\lambda  0$ is the rate parameter.\n\nThe problem of finding the yield now becomes one of determining the statistics of *fatal* defects. When a homogeneous PPP is \"thinned\" by an independent process (in this case, by retaining only defects that are fatal), the resulting process of fatal defects is also a Poisson process. The number of fatal defects, let's call it $N_f$, follows a Poisson distribution with a mean, $\\mu_f$. The yield, $Y$, is the probability of having zero fatal defects, $P(N_f=0)$. For a Poisson distribution, this is:\n$$Y = P(N_f=0) = \\frac{\\mu_f^0 \\exp(-\\mu_f)}{0!} = \\exp(-\\mu_f)$$\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the mean number of fatal defects, $\\mu_f$. This quantity is commonly referred to as the \"average number of faults\". It can be calculated by multiplying the defect density $D$ by the *average critical area*, $\\langle A_c \\rangle$. The average critical area is the critical area function, $A_c^{\\text{open}}(r)$, averaged over the probability distribution of the defect radius, $p(r)$.\n$$\\mu_f = D \\cdot \\langle A_c \\rangle$$\nThe average critical area is found by the expectation integral:\n$$\\langle A_c \\rangle = E[A_c^{\\text{open}}(r)] = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} A_c^{\\text{open}}(r) p(r) dr$$\n\nWe substitute the given expressions for $A_c^{\\text{open}}(r)$ and $p(r)$ into this integral:\n$$\\langle A_c \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (2 r L) (\\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda r)) dr$$\n\nWe can factor out the constants $2$, $L$, and $\\lambda$ from the integral:\n$$\\langle A_c \\rangle = 2 L \\lambda \\int_{0}^{\\infty} r \\exp(-\\lambda r) dr$$\n\nThe remaining integral, $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} r \\exp(-\\lambda r) dr$, is a standard form.

The integral we need to evaluate is related to this.\n$$E[r] = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} r p(r) dr = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} r (\\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda r)) dr = \\lambda \\int_{0}^{\\infty} r \\exp(-\\lambda r) dr$$\nSince $E[r] = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}$, we have:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\lambda} = \\lambda \\int_{0}^{\\infty} r \\exp(-\\lambda r) dr$$\n$$\\implies \\int_{0}^{\\infty} r \\exp(-\\lambda r) dr = \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2}$$\n\nNow we substitute this result back into the expression for the average critical area $\\langle A_c \\rangle$:\n$$\\langle A_c \\rangle = 2 L \\lambda \\left( \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} \\right) = \\frac{2L}{\\lambda}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the mean number of fatal defects, $\\mu_f$:\n$$\\mu_f = D \\cdot \\langle A_c \\rangle = D \\cdot \\frac{2L}{\\lambda} = \\frac{2DL}{\\lambda}$$\n\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $\\mu_f$ into the formula for the yield, $Y$:\n$$Y = \\exp(-\\mu_f) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2DL}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\n\nThis is the analytic expression for the defect-limited yield as a function of the given parameters $D$, $L$, and $\\lambda$.",
