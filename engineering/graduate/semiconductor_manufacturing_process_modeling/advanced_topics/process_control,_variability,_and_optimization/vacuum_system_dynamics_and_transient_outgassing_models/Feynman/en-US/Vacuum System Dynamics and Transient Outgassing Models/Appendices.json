The given parameters are physically realistic for a semiconductor process chamber and vacuum system. The modeling approach requested, based on the Ideal Gas Law and mass conservation, is a standard and correct method for analyzing vacuum system dynamics. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution can be sought.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the pressure change in the vacuum chamber is the conservation of mass, which can be expressed in terms of the number of gas molecules, $N$, within the chamber volume $V$. The rate of change of the number of molecules is the difference between the rate of molecules entering the chamber (inflow) and the rate of molecules leaving the chamber (outflow).\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = \\text{Inflow Rate} - \\text{Outflow Rate}\n$$\nThe inflow rate is due to the net internal gas load $G$, which is stated to be negligible, so $G=0$.\nThe outflow rate is the number of molecules per unit time removed by the pump. The effective pumping speed, $S_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, is defined as the volume of gas removed per unit time, measured at the pressure $p$ inside the chamber. The number of molecules removed per unit time is the product of the number density of molecules, $n=N/V$, and the effective pumping speed, $S_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n$$\n\\text{Outflow Rate} = n S_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{N}{V} S_{\\mathrm{eff}}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the conservation equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = 0 - \\frac{N}{V} S_{\\mathrm{eff}} = -\\frac{S_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{V} N\n$$\nTo express this equation in terms of pressure $p$, we use the Ideal Gas Law for the $N$ molecules in volume $V$ at temperature $T$:\n$$\npV = N k_B T\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. Since the volume $V$ and temperature $T$ are constant, we can relate the rate of change of $N$ to the rate of change of $p$ by differentiating the Ideal Gas Law with respect to time $t$:\n$$\nV \\frac{dp}{dt} = k_B T \\frac{dN}{dt}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $\\frac{dN}{dt}$ from the mass balance equation into this differentiated form of the Ideal Gas Law:\n$$\nV \\frac{dp}{dt} = k_B T \\left( -\\frac{S_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{V} N \\right)\n$$\nTo eliminate $N$ from this equation, we rearrange the Ideal Gas Law as $N = \\frac{pV}{k_B T}$ and substitute it into the right-hand side:\n$$\nV \\frac{dp}{dt} = k_B T \\left( -\\frac{S_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{V} \\frac{pV}{k_B T} \\right)\n$$\nThe terms $V$ and $k_B T$ cancel out, yielding the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the pressure $p(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dt} = -\\frac{S_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{V} p\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear homogeneous differential equation.

Derivation of the Governing Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)**\n\nThe dynamics of the partial pressure for each gas species $i$ in the chamber are governed by a mass balance equation. For a constant volume $V$ and constant temperature $T$, the rate of change of the quantity of gas $p_i V$ is equal to the total throughput of gas entering the volume minus the throughput of gas leaving it.\nThe total throughput is the sum of gas from in-gassing/outgassing, $Q_i$, and gas removed by the pump, $Q_{\\text{pump},i}$.\n\nThe mass balance for species $i$ can be written in terms of throughputs (pressure-volume flow rate) as:\n$$V \\frac{d p_i(t)}{dt} = \\sum Q_{\\text{in}} - \\sum Q_{\\text{out}}$$\nIn this system, the only source of gas is outgassing from internal surfaces, given by a constant throughput $Q_i$. The only sink is the vacuum pump. The throughput removed by a pump is defined as the product of the partial pressure at the pump inlet, $p_i(t)$, and the effective pumping speed for that species, $S_i$.\n$$Q_{\\text{in}} = Q_i$$\n$$Q_{\\text{out}} = S_i p_i(t)$$\nSubstituting these into the balance equation yields:\n$$V \\frac{d p_i(t)}{dt} = Q_i - S_i p_i(t)$$\nThis is the governing ordinary differential equation for the partial pressure $p_i(t)$ of species $i$. It is a first-order linear non-homogeneous ODE. We can write it in standard form:\n$$\\frac{d p_i(t)}{dt} + \\frac{S_i}{V} p_i(t) = \\frac{Q_i}{V}$$\n\n**2.

A value of $n=0$ gives the trivial solution $X(x)=0$, and negative values of $n$ do not produce new independent solutions, so we consider $n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$.\nThe eigenvalues are thus $\\lambda_{n} = \\frac{n\\pi}{l}$, and the corresponding eigenfunctions are $X_{n}(x) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{l}\\right)$.\n\nThe solution for each mode $n$ is of the form $C_{n}(x,t) = X_{n}(x)T_{n}(t)$. By the principle of superposition, the general solution is an infinite series of these modes:\n$$\nC(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_{n} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{l}\\right) \\exp\\left(-D\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{l}\\right)^{2} t\\right)\n$$\nwhere the coefficients $B_{n}$ are determined by the initial condition $C(x,0) = C_0$.\nAt $t=0$:\n$$\nC(x,0) = C_0 = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_{n} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{l}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the Fourier sine series expansion of the constant function $C_0$ on the interval $[0, l]$. The coefficients $B_{n}$ are given by:\n$$\nB_{n} = \\frac{2}{l} \\int_{0}^{l} C_0 \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{l}\\right) dx\n$$\n$$\nB_{n} = \\frac{2C_0}{l} \\left[ -\\frac{l}{n\\pi} \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{l}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{l} = -\\frac{2C_0}{n\\pi} (\\cos(n\\pi) - \\cos(0))\n$$\nSince $\\cos(n\\pi) = (-1)^{n}$ and $\\cos(0) = 1$, we have:\n$$\nB_{n} = -\\frac{2C_0}{n\\pi}((-1)^{n} - 1)\n$$\nThis expression evaluates to $0$ for even $n$, and to $\\frac{4C_0}{n\\pi}$ for odd $n$. Thus, we only sum over odd values of $n$.\nThe full solution for the concentration profile is:\n$$\nC(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1,3,5,\\dots}^{\\infty} \\frac{4C_0}{n\\pi} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{l}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{D n^{2} \\pi^{2} t}{l^{2}}\\right)\n$$\n\nNext, we derive the outgassing rate per unit area, $q(t)$. This requires the diffusive flux, $J(x,t) = -D \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}$.\nFirst, we find the spatial derivative of $C(x,t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} = \\sum_{n=1,3,5,\\dots}^{\\infty} \\frac{4C_0}{n\\pi} \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{l}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{l}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{D n^{2} \\pi^{2} t}{l^{2}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} = \\frac{4C_0}{l} \\sum_{n=1,3,5,\\dots}^{\\infty} \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{l}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{D n^{2} \\pi^{2} t}{l^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nThe flux is then:\n$$\nJ(x,t) = -D \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{4DC_0}{l} \\sum_{n=1,3,5,\\dots}^{\\infty} \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{l}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{D n^{2} \\pi^{2} t}{l^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nWe evaluate the flux at the two surfaces, $x=0$ and $x=l$:\nAt $x=0$:\n$$\nJ(0,t) = -\\frac{4DC_0}{l} \\sum_{n=1,3,5,\\dots}^{\\infty} \\cos(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{D n^{2} \\pi^{2} t}{l^{2}}\\right) = -\\frac{4DC_0}{l} \\sum_{n=1,3,5,\\dots}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{D n^{2} \\pi^{2} t}{l^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nAt $x=l$:\n$$\nJ(l,t) = -\\frac{4DC_0}{l} \\sum_{n=1,3,5,\\dots}^{\\infty} \\cos(n\\pi) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{D n^{2} \\pi^{2} t}{l^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nSince $n$ is odd, $\\cos(n\\pi) = -1$.\n$$\nJ(l,t) = -\\frac{4DC_0}{l} \\sum_{n=1,3,5,\\dots}^{\\infty} (-1) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{D n^{2} \\pi^{2} t}{l^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{4DC_0}{l} \\sum_{n=1,3,5,\\dots}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{D n^{2} \\pi^{2} t}{l^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nThe total outgassing rate per unit area is $q(t) = |J(0,t)| + |J(l,t)|$. Since the summation term is always positive for $t \\ge 0$, $J(0,t)$ is negative and $J(l,t)$ is positive. Thus, $|J(0,t)| = -J(0,t)$ and $|J(l,t)| = J(l,t)$.\n$$\nq(t) = \\left( \\frac{4DC_0}{l} \\sum_{n=1,3,5,\\dots}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{D n^{2} \\pi^{2} t}{l^{2}}\\right) \\right) + \\left( \\frac{4DC_0}{l} \\sum_{n=1,3,5,\\dots}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{D n^{2} \\pi^{2} t}{l^{2}}\\right) \\right)\n$$\n$$\nq(t) = \\frac{8DC_0}{l} \\sum_{n=1,3,5,\\dots}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{D n^{2} \\pi^{2} t}{l^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the complete eigenfunction series for $q(t)$.\n\nFinally, we extract the dominant long-time term, $q_{\\text{long}}(t)$. For large times ($t \\to \\infty$), the exponential terms decay rapidly. The rate of decay is governed by the $n^{2}$ factor in the exponent. The term with the smallest value of $n$ (i.e., the slowest decay) will dominate the series. The smallest odd integer is $n=1$.\nTherefore, the long-time behavior of the outgassing rate is well-approximated by the first term of the series:\n$$\nq_{\\text{long}}(t) = \\frac{8DC_0}{l} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{D (1)^{2} \\pi^{2} t}{l^{2}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nq_{\\text{long}}(t) = \\frac{8DC_0}{l} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{D \\pi^{2} t}{l^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the requested closed-form analytic expression for the dominant long-time exponential term of the outgassing rate.",
