It describes plane Poiseuille flow, a fundamental problem in fluid mechanics, modified with a physically relevant Navier slip boundary condition. This setup is a common and useful idealization for flows in microchannels and lubrication layers, such as the one in immersion lithography. The assumptions of steady, incompressible, and Stokes flow are appropriate for the described physical context. The problem is well-posed: a second-order ordinary differential equation with two distinct boundary conditions is provided, which guarantees a unique solution. All terms are clearly defined, and the units are internally consistent. The problem does not violate any physical laws, is not based on false premises, and is expressed in precise, objective language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe starting point is the steady, incompressible Navier-Stokes equation. For a velocity field $\\mathbf{u}$ and pressure field $p$, it is given by:\n$$ \\rho (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u} $$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the fluid density and $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity.\n\nThe problem states that the Reynolds number is small, so inertial effects are negligible. This is the Stokes flow limit, where the term $\\rho (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u}$ is dropped. The equation simplifies to:\n$$ 0 = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u} $$\nWe consider a fully developed flow in the $x$-direction between two parallel plates. The velocity vector is $\\mathbf{u} = u(z)\\mathbf{\\hat{i}}$, meaning the velocity components in the $y$ and $z$ directions are zero. From the continuity equation $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$, we have $\\partial u/\\partial x = 0$, which confirms that $u$ is a function of $z$ only.\nThe pressure gradient is given to be nonzero only in the $x$-direction, so $\\nabla p = (\\partial p / \\partial x)\\mathbf{\\hat{i}}$. Because $\\partial p/\\partial y = \\partial p/\\partial z = 0$, the pressure $p$ can only be a function of $x$. The problem states $\\partial p / \\partial x$ is constant.\n\nThe vector equation $0 = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$ reduces to a single scalar equation for the $x$-component of momentum:\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} + \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2} \\right) $$\nSince $u = u(z)$, the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$ are zero. As $\\partial p / \\partial x$ is a constant, we can write it as a total derivative $dp/dx$. This yields the governing ordinary differential equation for the velocity profile $u(z)$:\n$$ \\mu \\frac{d^2 u}{dz^2} = \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\nThis equation can be integrated twice with respect to $z$:\n$$ \\frac{du}{dz} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} z + C_1 $$\n$$ u(z) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} z^2 + C_1 z + C_2 $$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are integration constants to be determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1.  No-slip at the hood surface ($z=h$): $u(h) = 0$.\n2.  Navier slip at the wafer surface ($z=0$): $u(0) = b_{w} \\frac{du}{dz}\\bigg|_{z=0}$.\n\nApplying the second boundary condition at $z=0$:\nFrom the expressions for $u(z)$ and $du/dz$, we find:\n$u(0) = C_2$\n$\\frac{du}{dz}\\bigg|_{z=0} = C_1$\nSubstituting these into the Navier slip condition gives a relationship between the constants:\n$$ C_2 = b_w C_1 $$\nApplying the first boundary condition at $z=h$:\n$$ u(h) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} h^2 + C_1 h + C_2 = 0 $$\nWe now have a system of two linear equations for $C_1$ and $C_2$. Substituting $C_2 = b_w C_1$ into the equation for $u(h)$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} h^2 + C_1 h + b_w C_1 = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} h^2 + C_1 (h + b_w) = 0 $$\nSolving for $C_1$:\n$$ C_1 = -\\frac{h^2}{2\\mu(h+b_w)} \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\nAnd for $C_2$:\n$$ C_2 = b_w C_1 = -\\frac{b_w h^2}{2\\mu(h+b_w)} \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\nNow substitute the expressions for $C_1$ and $C_2$ back into the general solution for $u(z)$:\n$$ u(z) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} z^2 - \\left(\\frac{h^2}{2\\mu(h+b_w)} \\frac{dp}{dx}\\right) z - \\left(\\frac{b_w h^2}{2\\mu(h+b_w)} \\frac{dp}{dx}\\right) $$\nFactoring out the common term $\\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx}$:\n$$ u(z) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} \\left[ z^2 - \\frac{h^2}{h+b_w}z - \\frac{b_w h^2}{h+b_w} \\right] $$\nThis expression can be further factored to a more compact form:\n$$ u(z) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} \\left[ z(z-h) + \\frac{h b_w z - b_w h^2}{h+b_w} \\right] $$\n$$ u(z) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} \\left[ z(z-h) + \\frac{b_w h(z-h)}{h+b_w} \\right] $$\n$$ u(z) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} (z-h) \\left(z + \\frac{b_w h}{h+b_w}\\right) $$\nThis is the final expression for the velocity profile $u(z)$. Note that if the pressure gradient $\\frac{dp}{dx}$ is positive, the velocity $u(z)$ is negative for $z \\in [0, h)$, indicating flow in the negative $x$-direction, as expected.\n\nNext, we calculate the volumetric flow rate per unit width, $q$, by integrating $u(z)$ from $z=0$ to $z=h$:\n$$ q = \\int_0^h u(z) \\, dz $$\nFor integration, it is easier to use the unfactored polynomial form of $u(z)$:\n$$ q = \\frac{1}{2\\mu(h+b_w)} \\frac{dp}{dx} \\int_0^h \\left[ (h+b_w)z^2 - h^2 z - b_w h^2 \\right] dz $$\n$$ q = \\frac{1}{2\\mu(h+b_w)} \\frac{dp}{dx} \\left[ (h+b_w)\\frac{z^3}{3} - h^2 \\frac{z^2}{2} - b_w h^2 z \\right]_0^h $$\n$$ q = \\frac{1}{2\\mu(h+b_w)} \\frac{dp}{dx} \\left( (h+b_w)\\frac{h^3}{3} - h^2 \\frac{h^2}{2} - b_w h^3 \\right) $$\n$$ q = \\frac{1}{2\\mu(h+b_w)} \\frac{dp}{dx} \\left( \\frac{h^4 + b_w h^3}{3} - \\frac{h^4}{2} - b_w h^3 \\right) $$\nCombine terms inside the parenthesis:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)h^4 + \\left( \\frac{1}{3} - 1 \\right)b_w h^3 = -\\frac{1}{6}h^4 - \\frac{2}{3}b_w h^3 = -\\frac{h^3}{6}(h + 4b_w) $$\nSubstitute this back into the expression for $q$:\n$$ q = \\frac{1}{2\\mu(h+b_w)} \\frac{dp}{dx} \\left( -\\frac{h^3(h + 4b_w)}{6} \\right) $$\n$$ q = -\\frac{h^3(h + 4b_w)}{12\\mu(h+b_w)} \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\nThis is the final expression for the volumetric flow rate per unit width.

It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. We may proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\n1.  **Governing Equation**\n\n    As per the problem statement, we consider a steady, fully developed, incompressible flow with no pressure gradient in the flow direction ($x$) and no body forces. The momentum equation for the fluid in the $x$-direction simplifies to a balance of viscous shear forces. For a Newtonian fluid, this is expressed as:\n    $$ \\frac{d\\tau_{zx}}{dz} = 0 $$\n    where $\\tau_{zx} = \\mu \\frac{du}{dz}$ is the shear stress. This implies that the shear stress is constant throughout the fluid layer. The governing equation for the velocity profile $u(z)$ becomes:\n    $$ \\frac{d^2u}{dz^2} = 0 $$\n    Integrating this equation twice with respect to $z$ yields the general solution for a linear velocity profile:\n    $$ u(z) = C_1 z + C_2 $$\n    where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are integration constants.\n\n2.  **Boundary Conditions**\n\n    We need two boundary conditions to determine $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n    *   At the lens surface ($z=H$), the lens moves at velocity $U$. Assuming a no-slip condition here, the fluid velocity matches the surface velocity:\n        $$ u(H) = U $$\n    *   At the topcoat surface ($z=0$), which is stationary, there is slip. The problem provides two related formalisms:\n        *   **Interfacial Friction Law**: The interfacial shear stress, $\\tau_0 = \\tau_{zx}(0)$, is proportional to the slip velocity, $u_{slip} = u(0) - 0 = u(0)$, via the friction coefficient $\\lambda$.\n            $$ \\tau_0 = \\lambda u(0) $$\n        *   **Newtonian Constitutive Relation**: The shear stress is also given by the viscosity times the velocity gradient.\n            $$ \\tau_0 = \\left. \\mu \\frac{du}{dz} \\right|_{z=0} $$\n    Combining these gives the boundary condition at $z=0$:\n    $$ \\left. \\mu \\frac{du}{dz} \\right|_{z=0} = \\lambda u(0) $$\n\n3.  **Solving for the Velocity Profile**\n\n    Let's apply the boundary conditions to $u(z) = C_1 z + C_2$ and its derivative $\\frac{du}{dz} = C_1$.\n    *   From the condition at $z=H$:\n        $$ C_1 H + C_2 = U $$\n    *   From the slip condition at $z=0$:\n        $$ \\mu (C_1) = \\lambda (C_1(0) + C_2) \\implies \\mu C_1 = \\lambda C_2 $$\n    We now have a system of two linear equations for $C_1$ and $C_2$:\n    1.  $C_1 H + C_2 = U$\n    2.  $C_2 = \\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda} C_1$\n    Substitute (2) into (1):\n    $$ C_1 H + \\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda} C_1 = U \\implies C_1 \\left(H + \\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda}\\right) = U \\implies C_1 = \\frac{U}{H + \\mu/\\lambda} $$\n    Now, find $C_2$:\n    $$ C_2 = \\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda} C_1 = \\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda} \\frac{U}{H + \\mu/\\lambda} = \\frac{\\mu U}{\\lambda H + \\mu} $$\n    The velocity profile is:\n    $$ u(z) = \\left(\\frac{U}{H + \\mu/\\lambda}\\right)z + \\frac{\\mu U}{\\lambda H + \\mu} = \\frac{U (\\lambda z + \\mu)}{\\lambda H + \\mu} $$\n\n4.  **Introducing the Slip Length `b`**\n\n    The problem requires the result in terms of the slip length $b$. The slip length is defined by the Navier slip condition, which relates the slip velocity to the velocity gradient at the wall: $u_{slip} = b \\left. \\frac{du}{dz} \\right|_{\\text{wall}}$.\n    At $z=0$, this is $u(0) = b \\left. \\frac{du}{dz} \\right|_{z=0}$.\n    We previously established that $\\lambda u(0) = \\mu \\left. \\frac{du}{dz} \\right|_{z=0}$. Rearranging this gives $\\frac{u(0)}{\\left. \\frac{du}{dz} \\right|_{z=0}} = \\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda}$.\n    Comparing this with the definition of slip length, we find the relationship:\n    $$ b = \\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda} $$\n    Now, we can express the velocity profile in terms of $b$. Starting from $u(z) = \\frac{U (\\lambda z + \\mu)}{\\lambda H + \\mu}$, we divide the numerator and denominator by $\\lambda$:\n    $$ u(z) = \\frac{U(z + \\mu/\\lambda)}{H + \\mu/\\lambda} $$\n    Substituting $b = \\mu/\\lambda$:\n    $$ u(z) = U \\frac{z+b}{H+b} $$\n\n5.  **Wall Shear Stress `τ₀`**\n\n    The shear stress is constant, $\\tau_{zx} = \\mu \\frac{du}{dz}$.\n    From the velocity profile $u(z) = U \\frac{z+b}{H+b}$, the gradient is:\n    $$ \\frac{du}{dz} = \\frac{U}{H+b} $$\n    The shear stress at the wall $z=0$, denoted $\\tau_0$, is therefore:\n    $$ \\tau_0 = \\mu \\frac{U}{H+b} $$\n\n6.  **Physical Explanation**\n\n    The slip length is $b = \\mu/\\lambda$. For $b$ to be large, the interfacial friction coefficient $\\lambda$ must be small. $\\lambda$ quantifies the tangential momentum transfer between the liquid and the solid surface. Fluorinated surfaces are characterized by low surface energy and are strongly hydrophobic (water-repelling). The weak van der Waals forces and the inability to form strong hydrogen bonds with water molecules lead to very weak adhesion between the water and the surface. This weak solid-liquid interaction results in a low friction coefficient $\\lambda$, and consequently, a large slip length $b$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. $u(z)=U\\,\\dfrac{z+b}{H+b}$, $\\tau_0=\\mu\\,\\dfrac{U}{H+b}$, $b=\\dfrac{\\mu}{\\lambda}$; fluorinated topcoats have low surface energy and weak solid–liquid interactions with water (reduced hydrogen bonding and van der Waals coupling), which lowers $\\lambda$ and increases $b$.**\n    *   The expression for $u(z)$ matches our derivation.\n    *   The expression for $\\tau_0$ matches our derivation.\n    *   The expression for $b$ in terms of $\\mu$ and $\\lambda$ matches our derivation.\n    *   The physical explanation is correct and consistent with the derived relationship $b=\\mu/\\lambda$ and the known surface properties of fluorinated materials.\n    *   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. $u(z)=U\\,\\dfrac{z}{H}$, $\\tau_0=\\mu\\,\\dfrac{U}{H}$, $b$ increases because water viscosity $\\mu$ is reduced in the vicinity of hydrophobic surfaces; the hydrophobicity of fluorinated topcoats locally lowers $\\mu$, thereby increasing $b$.**\n    *   The velocity profile $u(z)=U\\,\\dfrac{z}{H}$ corresponds to a no-slip condition at $z=0$ (since $u(0)=0$), which contradicts the problem setup specifying a slip boundary.\n    *   The expression for $\\tau_0$ corresponds to this incorrect velocity profile.\n    *   The explanation proposes a variable viscosity $\\mu$, which contradicts the problem's explicit assumption that $\\mu$ is constant.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. $u(z)=U\\,\\dfrac{z}{H}$, $\\tau_0=\\mu\\,\\dfrac{U}{H}$, $b=\\dfrac{\\rho U^2}{H}$; fluorinated topcoats increase $b$ because higher inertial forces at the interface dominate viscous dissipation.**\n    *   The velocity profile and shear stress are incorrect as they assume no-slip at $z=0$.\n    *   The expression for $b$ is dimensionally inconsistent: $[\\rho U^2/H] = (ML^{-3})(L^2T^{-2})/L = ML^{-2}T^{-2}$, which are dimensions of pressure/stress, not length ($L$).\n    *   The explanation invokes inertial forces, which directly contradicts the problem's explicit assumption to \"neglect inertia (small Reynolds number)\".\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. $u(z)=U\\,\\dfrac{z}{H}$, $\\tau_0$ is independent of $b$, and $b$ is set primarily by nanometer-scale roughness amplitude $a$ via $b\\propto a$; fluorinated topcoats are rougher and thus exhibit larger $b$ regardless of interfacial friction or chemistry.**\n    *   The velocity profile is incorrect as it assumes no-slip at $z=0$.\n    *   The statement that $\\tau_0$ is independent of $b$ is false, as shown by our derived result $\\tau_0=\\mu U / (H+b)$.\n    *   The physical explanation incorrectly dismisses the role of interfacial chemistry and friction, which is the primary driver of slip on smooth surfaces and a prerequisite for large slip effects on rough hydrophobic surfaces (e.g., via the Cassie-Baxter state).

Assume steady state, one-dimensional heat conduction in the $z$-direction, constant properties, and negligible axial variations due to scanning.\n\nStarting from energy conservation in steady state and Fourier’s law of heat conduction, and using Newton’s law of cooling at both boundaries, derive a closed-form expression for the maximum steady-state temperature rise at the mid-plane, $\\Delta T_{\\max} = T(L/2) - T_{\\infty}$, in terms of $q$, $k_w$, $h_c$, and $L$. Express your final answer as a single analytical expression. No numerical evaluation is required, and no rounding is needed. State your final expression for $\\Delta T_{\\max}$; do not include units in the final expression.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the maximum steady-state temperature rise in a layer of water subjected to uniform volumetric heating and symmetric convective cooling. We begin from the fundamental principles of energy conservation.\n\nThe governing equation for one-dimensional, steady-state heat conduction in the $z$-direction with a uniform volumetric heat generation rate $q$ is the heat diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dz}\\left(k_w \\frac{dT}{dz}\\right) + q = 0\n$$\nAssuming the thermal conductivity of water, $k_w$, is constant, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2T}{dz^2} + \\frac{q}{k_w} = 0\n$$\nwhere $T(z)$ is the temperature as a function of position $z$ along the thickness of the water layer.\n\nThe boundary conditions are defined at the two interfaces, $z=0$ and $z=L$. At each interface, heat conducted to the surface from within the water is removed by convection to the surrounding fluid at a bulk temperature $T_{\\infty}$. A surface energy balance provides the boundary conditions.\n\nAt the lens-water interface ($z=0$), the outward normal direction from the water layer is $-z$. The energy balance requires that the heat flux conducted to the surface equals the heat flux convected away from the surface:\n$$\n-k_w \\left(\\frac{d T}{dz}\\right)\\bigg|_{z=0} \\cdot (-1) = h_c (T(0) - T_{\\infty})\n$$\n$$\nk_w \\frac{dT}{dz}\\bigg|_{z=0} = h_c (T(0) - T_{\\infty}) \\quad (\\text{BC 1})\n$$\n\nAt the water-resist interface ($z=L$), the outward normal is in the $+z$ direction. The energy balance is:\n$$\n-k_w \\frac{dT}{dz}\\bigg|_{z=L} = h_c (T(L) - T_{\\infty}) \\quad (\\text{BC 2})\n$$\n\nThe problem setup is symmetric: the geometry is a simple plane wall, the heat generation $q$ is uniform, and the convective boundary conditions ($h_c$, $T_{\\infty}$) are identical at both surfaces. Consequently, the temperature distribution $T(z)$ must be symmetric about the mid-plane, $z = L/2$. This symmetry implies that the temperature gradient at the mid-plane is zero, which corresponds to the location of the maximum temperature:\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dz}\\bigg|_{z=L/2} = 0\n$$\n\nWe can solve the governing differential equation by integrating it twice with respect to $z$:\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dz} = -\\frac{q}{k_w}z + C_1\n$$\n$$\nT(z) = -\\frac{q}{2k_w}z^2 + C_1 z + C_2\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are integration constants.\n\nApplying the symmetry condition at $z=L/2$ to the first integral allows us to determine $C_1$:\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dz}\\bigg|_{z=L/2} = -\\frac{q}{k_w}\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) + C_1 = 0 \\implies C_1 = \\frac{qL}{2k_w}\n$$\nSubstituting $C_1$ back into the expression for the temperature gradient gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dz} = \\frac{q}{k_w}\\left(\\frac{L}{2} - z\\right)\n$$\nAnd for the temperature profile:\n$$\nT(z) = -\\frac{q}{2k_w}z^2 + \\frac{qL}{2k_w}z + C_2\n$$\n\nNext, we use one of the boundary conditions to determine the second integration constant, $C_2$. Applying BC 1 at $z=0$:\n$$\nk_w \\frac{dT}{dz}\\bigg|_{z=0} = h_c (T(0) - T_{\\infty})\n$$\nWe evaluate the terms:\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dz}\\bigg|_{z=0} = \\frac{q}{k_w}\\left(\\frac{L}{2} - 0\\right) = \\frac{qL}{2k_w}\n$$\n$$\nT(0) = -\\frac{q}{2k_w}(0)^2 + \\frac{qL}{2k_w}(0) + C_2 = C_2\n$$\nSubstituting these into the boundary condition equation:\n$$\nk_w \\left(\\frac{qL}{2k_w}\\right) = h_c (C_2 - T_{\\infty})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{qL}{2} = h_c (C_2 - T_{\\infty})\n$$\nSolving for $C_2$:\n$$\nC_2 = T_{\\infty} + \\frac{qL}{2h_c}\n$$\n\nNow we have the complete expression for the temperature profile $T(z)$:\n$$\nT(z) = -\\frac{q}{2k_w}z^2 + \\frac{qL}{2k_w}z + T_{\\infty} + \\frac{qL}{2h_c}\n$$\nThis can be rewritten to show the temperature rise relative to the bulk fluid temperature:\n$$\nT(z) - T_{\\infty} = \\frac{q}{2k_w}(Lz - z^2) + \\frac{qL}{2h_c}\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum temperature rise, $\\Delta T_{\\max} = T(L/2) - T_{\\infty}$. We evaluate the expression at $z=L/2$:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\max} = T(L/2) - T_{\\infty} = \\frac{q}{2k_w}\\left(L\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right)^2\\right) + \\frac{qL}{2h_c}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\max} = \\frac{q}{2k_w}\\left(\\frac{L^2}{2} - \\frac{L^2}{4}\\right) + \\frac{qL}{2h_c}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\max} = \\frac{q}{2k_w}\\left(\\frac{L^2}{4}\\right) + \\frac{qL}{2h_c}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\max} = \\frac{qL^2}{8k_w} + \\frac{qL}{2h_c}\n$$\nThis final expression represents the maximum steady-state temperature rise at the mid-plane of the water layer. It consists of two terms: the first term, $\\frac{qL^2}{8k_w}$, represents the temperature rise from the surface to the center of the water layer due to internal conduction, and the second term, $\\frac{qL}{2h_c}$, represents the temperature rise at the surface relative to the bulk cooling fluid due to the convective thermal resistance.\nWe can factor the expression as:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\max} = \\frac{qL}{2}\\left(\\frac{L}{4k_w} + \\frac{1}{h_c}\\right)\n$$\nHowever, the expanded form is equally valid and physically illustrative.",
