            "problem": "Consider a uniform line-space grating patterned in a semiconductor wafer. Edge displacement along the line direction is modeled as two zero-mean, second-order stationary random processes: the left-edge displacement $E_{L}(x)$ and the right-edge displacement $E_{R}(x)$, where $x$ denotes position along the line. Assume both edges have equal variance, $\\operatorname{Var}(E_{L}) = \\operatorname{Var}(E_{R}) = \\sigma^{2}$, and a constant Pearson correlation coefficient $\\rho \\in [-1, 1]$ between their displacements at the same $x$, so that $\\operatorname{Cov}(E_{L}(x), E_{R}(x)) = \\rho \\sigma^{2}$ for all $x$. The line width fluctuation process is defined by $W(x) = E_{R}(x) - E_{L}(x)$, and measurements are performed over a long line such that ensemble averages equal spatial averages under standard ergodicity assumptions in metrology.\n\nBy metrology convention, Line Edge Roughness (LER) is the root-mean-square of a single-edge displacement, i.e., $\\mathrm{LER} = \\sqrt{\\operatorname{Var}(E_{L})}$ (equivalently $\\sqrt{\\operatorname{Var}(E_{R})}$ under equal variance), and Line Width Roughness (LWR) is the root-mean-square of the width fluctuation, i.e., $\\mathrm{LWR} = \\sqrt{\\operatorname{Var}(W)}$.

It is a standard application of the properties of variance and covariance to a physically relevant model in engineering. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Expression for LWR\nThe first task is to derive a closed-form expression for $\\mathrm{LWR}$ in terms of $\\mathrm{LER}$ and $\\rho$.\nBy definition, $\\mathrm{LWR} = \\sqrt{\\operatorname{Var}(W)}$.\nThe line width fluctuation process is given by $W(x) = E_{R}(x) - E_{L}(x)$.\nThe variance of $W(x)$, denoted $\\operatorname{Var}(W)$, is the variance of the difference of two random variables, $E_{R}(x)$ and $E_{L}(x)$. A fundamental property of variance for a linear combination of two random variables $A$ and $B$ is:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(aA + bB) = a^{2}\\operatorname{Var}(A) + b^{2}\\operatorname{Var}(B) + 2ab\\operatorname{Cov}(A, B) $$\nIn our case, $A = E_{R}(x)$, $B = E_{L}(x)$, $a = 1$, and $b = -1$. Applying this formula gives:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(W) = \\operatorname{Var}(E_{R} - E_{L}) = (1)^{2}\\operatorname{Var}(E_{R}) + (-1)^{2}\\operatorname{Var}(E_{L}) + 2(1)(-1)\\operatorname{Cov}(E_{R}, E_{L}) $$\nSince the processes are stationary, we can drop the explicit dependence on $x$.\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(W) = \\operatorname{Var}(E_{R}) + \\operatorname{Var}(E_{L}) - 2\\operatorname{Cov}(E_{R}, E_{L}) $$\nWe are given the following from the problem statement:\n- $\\operatorname{Var}(E_{L}) = \\sigma^{2}$\n- $\\operatorname{Var}(E_{R}) = \\sigma^{2}$\n- $\\operatorname{Cov}(E_{R}, E_{L}) = \\rho \\sigma^{2}$ (Covariance is symmetric, so $\\operatorname{Cov}(E_{R}, E_{L}) = \\operatorname{Cov}(E_{L}, E_{R})$).\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\operatorname{Var}(W)$:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(W) = \\sigma^{2} + \\sigma^{2} - 2\\rho\\sigma^{2} = 2\\sigma^{2} - 2\\rho\\sigma^{2} $$\nFactoring out the common term $2\\sigma^{2}$:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(W) = 2\\sigma^{2}(1 - \\rho) $$\nNow we can compute $\\mathrm{LWR}$ by taking the square root of the variance:\n$$ \\mathrm{LWR} = \\sqrt{\\operatorname{Var}(W)} = \\sqrt{2\\sigma^{2}(1 - \\rho)} = \\sigma\\sqrt{2(1 - \\rho)} $$\nThe problem defines $\\mathrm{LER} = \\sigma$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\mathrm{LWR}$:\n$$ \\mathrm{LWR} = \\mathrm{LER}\\sqrt{2(1 - \\rho)} $$\nThis is the first required result: a closed-form expression relating $\\mathrm{LWR}$ to $\\mathrm{LER}$ and $\\rho$.\n\n### Determination of $\\rho$ for the Condition $\\mathrm{LWR} = 2\\,\\mathrm{LER}$\nThe second task is to find the value of the correlation coefficient $\\rho$ for which the line width roughness is exactly twice the line edge roughness.\nWe start with the given condition:\n$$ \\mathrm{LWR} = 2\\,\\mathrm{LER} $$\nSubstitute the expression for $\\mathrm{LWR}$ we just derived:\n$$ \\mathrm{LER}\\sqrt{2(1 - \\rho)} = 2\\,\\mathrm{LER} $$\nAssuming that the line has some roughness, $\\mathrm{LER} > 0$. We can therefore divide both sides of the equation by $\\mathrm{LER}$:\n$$ \\sqrt{2(1 - \\rho)} = 2 $$\nTo solve for $\\rho$, we square both sides of the equation:\n$$ \\left(\\sqrt{2(1 - \\rho)}\\right)^{2} = 2^{2} $$\n$$ 2(1 - \\rho) = 4 $$\nDivide both sides by $2$:\n$$ 1 - \\rho = 2 $$\nFinally, we solve for $\\rho$:\n$$ \\rho = 1 - 2 = -1 $$\nThis value, $\\rho = -1$, indicates perfect anti-correlation between the left and right edge displacements. This is physically intuitive: for a fixed edge variance, the width fluctuation is maximized when the two edges move in opposite directions, which corresponds to $\\rho = -1$. The derived value lies within the valid range for a Pearson correlation coefficient, $\\rho \\in [-1, 1]$.\n\nThe two final results are the derived expression for $\\mathrm{LWR}$ and the specific value of $\\rho$.",

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique and meaningful solution. The problem asks for the derivation of the power spectral density (PSD) for line edge roughness (LER), which is modeled as a zero-mean, wide-sense stationary (WSS) stochastic process.\n\nThe fundamental relationship between the autocovariance function of a WSS process and its PSD is given by the Wiener-Khinchin theorem. The theorem states that the PSD, denoted here as $S_e(k)$, is the Fourier transform of the autocovariance function, $C_{ee}(\\Delta x)$. The spatial frequency is denoted by $k$. We define the Fourier transform pair as:\n$$S_e(k) = \\mathcal{F}\\{C_{ee}(\\Delta x)\\} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} C_{ee}(\\Delta x) e^{-i k \\Delta x} \\, d(\\Delta x)$$\n$$C_{ee}(\\Delta x) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{S_e(k)\\} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} S_e(k) e^{i k \\Delta x} \\, dk$$\nwhere $i$ is the imaginary unit, defined as $i^2 = -1$.\n\nThe problem provides a specific model for the autocovariance function, corresponding to an exponential spatial correlation:\n$$C_{ee}(\\Delta x) = \\sigma^{2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{|\\Delta x|}{\\xi}\\right)$$\nHere, $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the edge fluctuations, and $\\xi$ is the correlation length.

We split the integral over the entire real axis into two parts: from $-\\infty$ to $0$, and from $0$ to $\\infty$.\n$$S_e(k) = \\sigma^{2} \\left[ \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{-\\Delta x}{\\xi}\\right) e^{-i k \\Delta x} \\, d(\\Delta x) + \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\xi}\\right) e^{-i k \\Delta x} \\, d(\\Delta x) \\right]$$\n$$S_e(k) = \\sigma^{2} \\left[ \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\xi}\\right) e^{-i k \\Delta x} \\, d(\\Delta x) + \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\xi}\\right) e^{-i k \\Delta x} \\, d(\\Delta x) \\right]$$\n\nNow, we combine the exponents in each integral:\n$$S_e(k) = \\sigma^{2} \\left[ \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} \\exp\\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{\\xi} - ik\\right)\\Delta x\\right) d(\\Delta x) + \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{1}{\\xi} + ik\\right)\\Delta x\\right) d(\\Delta x) \\right]$$\n\nWe proceed to evaluate each definite integral.\nFor the first integral:\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} \\exp\\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{\\xi} - ik\\right)\\Delta x\\right) d(\\Delta x) = \\left[ \\frac{\\exp\\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{\\xi} - ik\\right)\\Delta x\\right)}{\\frac{1}{\\xi} - ik} \\right]_{-\\infty}^{0} $$\n$$ = \\frac{\\exp(0)}{\\frac{1}{\\xi} - ik} - \\lim_{\\Delta x \\to -\\infty} \\frac{\\exp\\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{\\xi} - ik\\right)\\Delta x\\right)}{\\frac{1}{\\xi} - ik} $$\nSince $\\xi > 0$, the real part of the exponent coefficient, $1/\\xi$, is positive. Thus, the limit term goes to $0$. The result of the first integral is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{\\xi} - ik} $$\n\nFor the second integral:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{1}{\\xi} + ik\\right)\\Delta x\\right) d(\\Delta x) = \\left[ \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{1}{\\xi} + ik\\right)\\Delta x\\right)}{-\\left(\\frac{1}{\\xi} + ik\\right)} \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} $$\n$$ = \\lim_{\\Delta x \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{1}{\\xi} + ik\\right)\\Delta x\\right)}{-\\left(\\frac{1}{\\xi} + ik\\right)} - \\frac{\\exp(0)}{-\\left(\\frac{1}{\\xi} + ik\\right)} $$\nAgain, since $\\xi > 0$, the real part of the exponent coefficient, $-1/\\xi$, is negative.
