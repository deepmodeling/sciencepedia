## Introduction
The precise control of atomic-scale processes is the cornerstone of modern materials engineering, particularly in the fabrication of advanced semiconductor devices. The kinetics of phenomena such as [dopant diffusion](@entry_id:1123918), [thin film growth](@entry_id:199142), and defect [annealing](@entry_id:159359) directly determine device structure, performance, and reliability. However, bridging the gap between the fundamental quantum mechanical interactions of atoms and the collective, macroscopic behavior observed over manufacturing timescales represents a profound scientific challenge. Atomistic and first-principles modeling provides a powerful pathway to address this challenge, enabling the creation of predictive simulations grounded in fundamental physics rather than empirical fitting.

This article provides a comprehensive overview of the theoretical and computational methods used to model process kinetics from the ground up. Over the next three sections, you will gain a deep understanding of this multiscale framework. The journey begins with the **Principles and Mechanisms**, where we will dissect the core theoretical tools, from Density Functional Theory (DFT) for calculating the potential energy surface, to Transition State Theory (TST) for determining reaction rates, and finally to Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) for simulating the system's evolution over long timescales. Next, in **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, we will explore how this suite of methods is applied to solve critical, real-world problems in semiconductor processing, illustrating how to calculate kinetic parameters and predict phenomena like [defect-mediated diffusion](@entry_id:274988) and [epitaxial growth](@entry_id:157792) morphology. Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** section offers practical exercises designed to solidify your understanding of essential computational techniques, such as convergence testing and uncertainty analysis, bridging the gap between theory and implementation.

## Principles and Mechanisms

### The Born-Oppenheimer Approximation: Separating Electrons and Nuclei

The kinetics of atomic processes in materials, such as the diffusion of dopants or the growth of thin films, are fundamentally governed by the interactions and motions of electrons and atomic nuclei. A complete description requires solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for this complex many-body system. The total Hamiltonian, $H_{\text{tot}}$, includes kinetic energy operators for both the electrons ($T_e$) and the nuclei ($T_N$), as well as potential energy terms for electron-electron ($V_{ee}$), nucleus-nucleus ($V_{NN}$), and electron-nucleus ($V_{eN}$) interactions. For a system of any realistic size, solving this equation directly is an intractable task.

The path to a computationally feasible model begins with a crucial physical insight: the immense disparity in mass between an electron ($m_e$) and an atomic nucleus ($M_{\text{ion}}$). For silicon, the mass ratio is approximately $M_{\text{Si}}/m_e \approx 51,400$. Due to their much smaller mass, electrons move and rearrange on a timescale far faster than the characteristic vibrational periods of the much heavier nuclei. From the perspective of the fast-moving electrons, the nuclei appear to be nearly stationary at any given instant. Conversely, from the perspective of the slow-moving nuclei, the electrons form a quantum cloud that instantaneously adjusts to the nuclear configuration.

This [separation of timescales](@entry_id:191220) is formalized by the **Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation**. The core idea is to decouple the electronic and [nuclear motion](@entry_id:185492). First, we consider the nuclei to be "clamped" at a fixed set of positions, $\{\mathbf{R}\}$. We then solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation for the electrons moving in the static external potential created by these fixed nuclei. This is the electronic Schrödinger equation:
$$H_e(\{\mathbf{R}\}) \phi_n(\{\mathbf{r}\}; \{\mathbf{R}\}) = E_n(\{\mathbf{R}\}) \phi_n(\{\mathbf{r}\}; \{\mathbf{R}\})$$
Here, $H_e = T_e + V_{ee} + V_{eN}$ is the electronic Hamiltonian, which depends parametrically on the nuclear coordinates $\{\mathbf{R}\}$. Its solutions are the electronic wavefunctions $\phi_n$ and their corresponding electronic energies $E_n$. The ground-state energy, $E_0(\{\mathbf{R}\})$, when plotted as a function of all nuclear coordinates, defines the **Potential Energy Surface (PES)**.

The BO approximation then posits that the total wavefunction of the system can be written as a simple product of a nuclear wavefunction $\chi(\{\mathbf{R}\})$ and the ground-state electronic wavefunction $\phi_0(\{\mathbf{r}\}; \{\mathbf{R}\})$. The nuclei are then assumed to move classically (or quantum mechanically, in some contexts) on the PES defined by $E_0(\{\mathbf{R}\})$. In essence, the electrons provide the "glue" that binds the nuclei, and the strength of this glue at any configuration is the electronic [ground-state energy](@entry_id:263704). This powerful simplification replaces the complex, coupled [many-body problem](@entry_id:138087) with the more manageable task of first calculating a static energy landscape and then simulating [nuclear motion](@entry_id:185492) upon it.

The validity of the BO approximation hinges on the assumption that the system remains in a single electronic state (typically the ground state) as the nuclei move. Transitions to [excited electronic states](@entry_id:186336) are assumed to be negligible. This condition is generally met for thermal processes in semiconductors like silicon, where the [electronic band gap](@entry_id:267916), $E_g$, which represents the energy required to excite an electron from the valence band to the conduction band, is much larger than the characteristic thermal energy, $k_B T$, and typical phonon energies . For instance, at a typical [annealing](@entry_id:159359) temperature of $1000 \, \mathrm{K}$, $k_B T \approx 0.086 \, \mathrm{eV}$, whereas silicon's band gap is approximately $1.1 \, \mathrm{eV}$. As long as the energy separation between the ground and first [excited electronic states](@entry_id:186336) remains large throughout the process, the **[non-adiabatic coupling](@entry_id:159497) terms** that would induce transitions between electronic states can be safely neglected. The BO approximation is a specific application of the more general **[adiabatic theorem](@entry_id:142116)** of quantum mechanics, which applies to any quantum system whose Hamiltonian varies slowly in time.

### Calculating the Potential Energy Surface with Density Functional Theory

Having established the concept of a potential energy surface, the central task becomes calculating the ground-state electronic energy $E_0(\{\mathbf{R}\})$ for any given arrangement of atoms. The most widely used and successful first-principles method for this purpose in [condensed matter](@entry_id:747660) physics and materials science is **Density Functional Theory (DFT)**.

The theoretical foundation of DFT is provided by the two **Hohenberg-Kohn theorems**. The first theorem proves that the ground-state electron density, $n(\mathbf{r})$, of a many-electron system uniquely determines the external potential and thus all properties of the system, including the total energy. This is a profound shift in perspective: instead of dealing with the complicated [many-body wavefunction](@entry_id:203043), which depends on $3N$ spatial coordinates for $N$ electrons, we can work with the electron density, a function of only three spatial coordinates. The second theorem establishes a [variational principle](@entry_id:145218) for the energy, stating that the true [ground-state energy](@entry_id:263704) is the global minimum of the [energy functional](@entry_id:170311) $E[n]$ with respect to the density.

While exact in principle, the form of the universal [energy functional](@entry_id:170311) is unknown. The practical implementation of DFT was enabled by the **Kohn-Sham (KS) approach**. The KS strategy is to replace the intractable problem of interacting electrons with a fictitious, auxiliary system of non-interacting electrons that, by design, has the exact same ground-state density $n(\mathbf{r})$ as the real, interacting system. For this non-interacting system, the kinetic energy is exactly known, and the equations of motion are a set of single-particle Schrödinger-like equations known as the **Kohn-Sham equations** :
$$ \left[-\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2 + v_{\text{eff}}(\mathbf{r})\right]\phi_i(\mathbf{r}) = \epsilon_i \phi_i(\mathbf{r}) $$
The orbitals $\phi_i$ are the Kohn-Sham orbitals, from which the density is constructed as $n(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_i^{\text{occ}} |\phi_i(\mathbf{r})|^2$. The [effective potential](@entry_id:142581), $v_{\text{eff}}$, is given by:
$$ v_{\text{eff}}(\mathbf{r}) = v_{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{r}) + v_{H}(\mathbf{r}) + v_{xc}(\mathbf{r}) $$
It consists of the external potential from the nuclei ($v_{\text{ext}}$), the classical electrostatic (Hartree) potential from the electron density itself ($v_H$), and the **exchange-correlation potential** ($v_{xc}$). The $v_{xc}$ term is the functional derivative of the **exchange-correlation energy functional**, $E_{xc}[n]$. This functional is the heart of KS-DFT; it is defined to contain everything that was left out by the non-interacting approximation. This includes the non-classical exchange and correlation effects arising from the Pauli exclusion principle and Coulombic repulsion, as well as the difference between the true kinetic energy of the interacting system and the kinetic energy of the fictitious non-interacting system.

It is instructive to contrast KS-DFT with the **Hartree-Fock (HF)** method. HF is a wavefunction-based method that approximates the [many-electron wavefunction](@entry_id:174975) as a single Slater determinant. This approach treats the quantum mechanical exchange interaction exactly (within the single-determinant framework) but completely neglects electron correlation—the instantaneous correlated motion of electrons avoiding each other due to their mutual repulsion. KS-DFT, in principle, includes both exchange and correlation effects through the $E_{xc}[n]$ functional. In practice, the [exact form](@entry_id:273346) of $E_{xc}[n]$ is unknown and must be approximated (e.g., using the Local Density Approximation, LDA, or Generalized Gradient Approximations, GGA). Despite this approximation, DFT often provides a more balanced and accurate description of many materials properties than HF, precisely because it includes a model for [electron correlation](@entry_id:142654).

For calculations in solids, which involve a large number of atoms, a [plane-wave basis set](@entry_id:204040) is typically used to expand the KS orbitals. However, the true valence wavefunctions oscillate rapidly near the atomic cores to remain orthogonal to the core electron states. Representing these oscillations would require an impractically large number of [plane waves](@entry_id:189798) (a high [kinetic energy cutoff](@entry_id:186065)). This difficulty is overcome by using **[pseudopotentials](@entry_id:170389)**, which replace the strong [nuclear potential](@entry_id:752727) and the tightly bound core electrons with a weaker, effective potential. This pseudopotential is designed to reproduce the scattering properties of the true atom for the valence electrons outside a certain core radius, but it yields smooth, nodeless pseudo-wavefunctions inside the core. The main families of pseudopotentials are :
- **Norm-Conserving Pseudopotentials (NCPPs):** These enforce that the charge contained within the core radius is identical for both the pseudo-wavefunction and the true all-electron wavefunction. This constraint ensures excellent transferability (the ability to work well in different chemical environments) but results in "hard" potentials that require high energy cutoffs.
- **Ultrasoft Pseudopotentials (USPPs):** These relax the norm-conservation constraint to produce much smoother ("softer") wavefunctions, which drastically reduces the required [energy cutoff](@entry_id:177594) and computational cost. The charge deficit is corrected by introducing augmentation charges.
- **Projector Augmented Wave (PAW) Method:** This is a more formal and generally more accurate method that rigorously reconstructs the full all-electron wavefunction from a smooth auxiliary wavefunction. It combines the accuracy of all-electron methods with the efficiency of a [plane-wave basis](@entry_id:140187). PAW is particularly robust for systems with complex core-valence interactions, such as those involving heavier dopant elements like arsenic ($As$) and antimony ($Sb$), where the shallow d-shell "semicore" states play an important chemical role.

### Modeling Atomic Transitions: From Statics to Kinetics

The potential energy surface computed via DFT provides a static picture of the energy landscape. Kinetic processes, such as diffusion, involve atoms moving from one stable configuration to another. On the PES, stable and [metastable states](@entry_id:167515) correspond to local minima. The pathway for a transition between two minima typically proceeds over an energy barrier. The point of highest energy along the path of least energy increase is the **transition state**. Mathematically, a transition state is a **first-order saddle point** on the PES: a [stationary point](@entry_id:164360) where the gradient of the energy is zero ($\nabla E(\mathbf{R}) = \mathbf{0}$), and the Hessian matrix of second derivatives has exactly one negative eigenvalue. The eigenvector corresponding to this negative eigenvalue defines the direction of the [reaction coordinate](@entry_id:156248) at the saddle point, which is the direction of unstable motion over the barrier .

The framework connecting the properties of the PES to the rate of an activated event is **Transition State Theory (TST)**. In its most common form, **Harmonic Transition State Theory (HTST)**, the rate constant $k$ for an elementary process is given by an Arrhenius-like expression:
$$ k = \nu \exp\left(-\frac{E_a}{k_B T}\right) $$
Here, $E_a$ is the **activation energy**, defined as the energy difference between the transition state ($E_{TS}$) and the initial state minimum ($E_{min}$), i.e., $E_a = E_{TS} - E_{min}$. The pre-exponential factor, $\nu$, is the **attempt frequency**, which represents how often the system "attempts" to cross the barrier. To predict the kinetics of a process from first principles, we must therefore compute both $E_a$ and $\nu$.

### Calculating Kinetic Parameters from First Principles

#### The Activation Energy

Finding the activation energy requires locating both the initial minimum and the transition state saddle point on the $3N$-dimensional PES. While finding minima is a standard optimization problem, locating a saddle point is more challenging. Methods designed for this purpose typically search for a **Minimum Energy Path (MEP)** connecting the initial and final states. An MEP is a one-dimensional curve on the PES along which the force perpendicular to the path is zero at every point. The transition state is the point of maximum energy along the MEP.

The most widely used method for finding MEPs is the **Nudged Elastic Band (NEB)** method. In NEB, the path is represented by a discrete chain of "images" (atomic configurations) connecting the initial and final states. The images are connected by fictitious springs to ensure they remain distributed along the path. The entire chain of images is then relaxed simultaneously. The key innovation in NEB is the force projection scheme . For each image, the true force from the PES, $-\nabla E(\mathbf{R})$, is calculated. This force is decomposed into a component perpendicular to the path and a component parallel to it. The perpendicular component acts to move the image towards the MEP. The parallel component, which would cause the images to slide down towards the minima, is removed and replaced by the parallel component of the spring forces. This "nudging" decouples the relaxation of the path shape from the distribution of images along it.

A [common refinement](@entry_id:146567) is the **Climbing-Image NEB (CI-NEB)** method. In this variant, after an initial relaxation, the image with the highest energy is identified. For this "climbing image," the spring forces are turned off, and the parallel component of the true PES force is inverted. This drives the image uphill along the path until it converges exactly onto the saddle point, yielding a highly accurate value for the transition state energy $E_{TS}$ and thus the activation barrier $E_a$. It is crucial to recognize that an MEP is a static, geometric construct representing the path of lowest energy on the zero-temperature PES. It is not a real-time trajectory that atoms would follow at finite temperature, which would be a stochastic path fluctuating around the MEP as determined by a Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation.

#### The Attempt Frequency

The attempt frequency $\nu$ in the HTST rate expression accounts for the entropic contributions related to the vibrations of the atoms around their equilibrium positions. Within the [harmonic approximation](@entry_id:154305), it can be calculated using the **Vineyard formula**, which relates $\nu$ to the normal mode [vibrational frequencies](@entry_id:199185) at the initial state minimum and the transition state saddle point :
$$ \nu = \frac{\prod_{i=1}^{3N} f_i^{\text{min}}}{\prod_{j=1}^{3N-1} f_j^{\ddagger}} $$
Here, $\{f_i^{\text{min}}\}$ are the $3N$ [normal mode frequencies](@entry_id:171165) at the minimum, and $\{f_j^{\ddagger}\}$ are the $3N-1$ real [normal mode frequencies](@entry_id:171165) at the saddle point (the single imaginary frequency corresponding to motion along the reaction coordinate is excluded). These frequencies are obtained from a **[vibrational analysis](@entry_id:146266)**, which involves computing the Hessian matrix (the matrix of second derivatives of the energy) at the respective [stationary points](@entry_id:136617) and finding its eigenvalues.

For example, consider a hop of a silicon adatom on a surface where [vibrational analysis](@entry_id:146266) yields four stable frequencies at the minimum ($f^{\mathrm{min}} = \{1.6, 2.4, 6.0, 7.0\}\, \mathrm{THz}$) and three stable frequencies at the saddle point ($f^{\ddagger} = \{1.2, 2.5, 6.5\}\, \mathrm{THz}$). The attempt frequency would be:
$$ \nu = \frac{1.6 \times 2.4 \times 6.0 \times 7.0}{1.2 \times 2.5 \times 6.5} \times 10^{12} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1} \approx 8.27 \times 10^{12} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1} $$
This theoretical attempt frequency is a property of the [harmonic potential](@entry_id:169618) energy surface. The experimentally measured Arrhenius prefactor may differ due to [anharmonic effects](@entry_id:184957) and dynamical corrections, such as the possibility of trajectories recrossing the saddle point, which are not included in basic TST.

### Simulating Long-Timescale Dynamics: Kinetic Monte Carlo

With a complete catalog of all relevant elementary processes (e.g., diffusion hops, adsorption, desorption) and their first-principles rates $k_i$, the next challenge is to simulate the evolution of the system over time. The characteristic timescales of these processes (microseconds to seconds) are often many orders of magnitude longer than the atomic vibrational periods (femtoseconds) that can be accessed by direct MD simulations. This "[timescale problem](@entry_id:178673)" is addressed by **Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC)**.

KMC is an event-driven stochastic method that models the time evolution of a system that transitions between discrete states according to a known set of event rates. It is based on the assumption that the system loses "memory" of how it arrived in its current state between the rare, thermally activated events. The simulation proceeds using the **[residence-time algorithm](@entry_id:754262)** (also known as the BKL algorithm) :

1.  From the current state of the system, identify all possible escape pathways (events), indexed by $i=1, \dots, M$. Each event has a rate constant $k_i$ calculated from TST.
2.  Calculate the total rate of escape from the current state, $K = \sum_{i=1}^{M} k_i$.
3.  Advance the simulation time by a stochastic time step, $\Delta t$, drawn from an [exponential distribution](@entry_id:273894) with mean $1/K$: $\Delta t = -\ln(u_1)/K$, where $u_1$ is a random number uniformly distributed in $(0, 1]$.
4.  Select one event, $j$, to occur. The probability of selecting event $j$ is proportional to its rate: $P_j = k_j/K$. This is done by choosing the event $j$ that satisfies $\sum_{i=1}^{j-1} k_i  u_2 K \le \sum_{i=1}^{j} k_i$, where $u_2$ is a second random number in $(0, 1]$.
5.  Update the system configuration according to the chosen event $j$ and repeat the process from step 1.

It is critical to distinguish KMC from **Metropolis Monte Carlo**. Metropolis MC is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method used for equilibrium statistical sampling. It generates a sequence of states according to their thermodynamic probability (e.g., the Boltzmann distribution), typically using an acceptance rule like $A = \min(1, \exp(-\Delta E/k_B T))$. Metropolis MC does not have an inherent physical timescale and explores the equilibrium configuration space. KMC, in contrast, explicitly simulates the non-equilibrium kinetic evolution of the system in physical time, making it the appropriate tool for modeling process kinetics.

### Applications to Semiconductor Process Kinetics

The multiscale framework connecting DFT, TST, and KMC provides a powerful predictive tool for understanding and engineering semiconductor processes.

#### Point Defects and Diffusion in the Bulk

Atomic diffusion in [crystalline solids](@entry_id:140223) is almost always mediated by [point defects](@entry_id:136257), such as vacancies (missing atoms) or [self-interstitials](@entry_id:161456) (extra atoms in the interstitial space). To model these processes, one must first understand the thermodynamic properties of the defects themselves. The key quantity is the **[defect formation energy](@entry_id:159392)**, $E^f$, which is the energy cost to create a defect. From a grand-canonical perspective, where the crystal is in equilibrium with reservoirs of atoms and electrons, the formation energy of a defect with charge $q$ is given by :
$$ E^f(q) = (E_{\text{defect}, q} - E_{\text{bulk}}) - \sum_i n_i \mu_i + q(E_F + E_{\text{VBM}}) + E_{\text{corr}} $$
Each term has a precise meaning:
- $E_{\text{defect}, q}$ and $E_{\text{bulk}}$ are the total energies from DFT calculations of a large "supercell" with and without the defect, respectively.
- The term $\sum_i n_i \mu_i$ accounts for the cost of exchanging atoms with external reservoirs. $n_i$ is the number of atoms of species $i$ added to ($n_i > 0$) or removed from ($n_i  0$) the solid, and $\mu_i$ is the chemical potential of that species, which is constrained by thermodynamic stability conditions.
- The term $q(E_F + E_{\text{VBM}})$ is the energy cost of exchanging electrons with the electron reservoir. $q$ is the charge of the defect, and the electron chemical potential is the Fermi level, $E_F$, which is conventionally referenced to the **valence band maximum**, $E_{\text{VBM}}$.
- $E_{\text{corr}}$ is a correction term to remove artifacts from the finite size of the supercell and [periodic boundary conditions](@entry_id:147809), especially important for charged defects.

With the formation energies ($E_f$) and migration barriers ($E_m$) for various defects calculated, one can determine the overall activation energy for [self-diffusion](@entry_id:754665), $Q = E_f + E_m$. In silicon, both vacancies and [self-interstitials](@entry_id:161456) contribute. Based on typical DFT results where the interstitial formation energy is comparable to or sometimes lower than the [vacancy formation energy](@entry_id:154859) ($E_f^I \lesssim E_f^V$) and its migration barrier is also significantly lower ($E_m^I \ll E_m^V$), the **interstitial-mediated mechanism** is found to dominate [self-diffusion](@entry_id:754665) at equilibrium . Dopant diffusion often involves more complex interactions, such as the **kick-out mechanism**, where a self-interstitial displaces a substitutional dopant into an interstitial site, creating a mobile dopant interstitial ($X_s + I \rightleftharpoons X_i$). This couples the dopant diffusivity directly to the self-interstitial population.

#### Surface Processes in Epitaxial Growth

The same first-principles KMC approach is used to model the [morphology](@entry_id:273085) of thin films during [epitaxial growth](@entry_id:157792). The key kinetic processes involve adatoms on the surface. DFT calculations are used to determine the energetics of :
- **Adsorption energy ($E_{\text{ads}}$):** The energy released when an atom binds to the surface from the gas phase.
- **Surface diffusion barrier:** The activation energy for an [adatom](@entry_id:191751) to hop between adjacent binding sites on a terrace. A lower barrier leads to a higher diffusion coefficient, allowing adatoms to travel farther and find thermodynamically favorable sites (like step edges), resulting in fewer, larger islands.
- **Desorption barrier:** The activation energy for an [adatom](@entry_id:191751) to leave the surface. A higher barrier increases the residence time of adatoms, leading to a higher [adatom](@entry_id:191751) concentration and increased nucleation rates.
- **Ehrlich-Schwoebel (ES) barrier:** A crucial parameter governing interlayer transport. It is an *additional* kinetic barrier that an adatom faces when attempting to move *down* from an upper terrace to a lower one by hopping over a step edge. A large ES barrier traps atoms on the terrace where they land. This prevents atoms deposited on top of an island from smoothing the layer below, leading to a net "uphill" mass flux that destabilizes [layer-by-layer growth](@entry_id:270398) and promotes the formation of three-dimensional mounds.

By parameterizing a KMC model with these fundamental rates, one can simulate and predict the evolution of surface [morphology](@entry_id:273085) under different growth conditions (temperature, deposition flux), providing invaluable insight for [process control](@entry_id:271184).

### The Multiscale Hierarchy: Beyond First Principles

While DFT provides the gold-standard accuracy for calculating energies and forces from quantum mechanics, its computational cost limits its application to systems of a few hundred atoms and simulation times of picoseconds. To access the larger length scales (millions of atoms) and longer timescales (nanoseconds to microseconds) relevant to many phenomena, a bridge is needed to computationally cheaper models. This is the role of **classical interatomic potentials**, or force fields.

These potentials are analytical functions that describe the energy of the system as a function of atomic positions, bypassing the explicit solution of the electronic structure problem. They are often developed and parameterized to reproduce experimental data or, increasingly, large datasets of DFT calculations. The functional form of the potential is chosen to capture the essential physics of the material's bonding :
- **Embedded Atom Method (EAM):** Describes energy via an embedding function dependent on local electron density. It lacks explicit angular dependence, making it well-suited for metals with delocalized, non-[directional bonding](@entry_id:154367).
- **Stillinger-Weber (SW) and Tersoff potentials:** These potentials incorporate explicit three-body angular terms (SW) or environment-dependent bond-order terms (Tersoff), making them suitable for describing the directional [covalent bonding](@entry_id:141465) of materials like silicon and germanium.
- **Reactive Force Fields (ReaxFF):** These are sophisticated bond-order-based potentials that include a [charge equilibration](@entry_id:189639) scheme to model changing partial charges. They are designed to simulate chemical reactions involving [bond formation](@entry_id:149227) and breaking, such as the oxidation of silicon carbide.

These classical potentials enable large-scale Molecular Dynamics or KMC simulations that would be impossible with DFT alone. The [first-principles methods](@entry_id:1125017) described in this chapter thus form the foundational base of a multiscale modeling hierarchy, providing the accurate energetic and kinetic parameters that inform and validate the simpler, more computationally efficient models used to simulate complex manufacturing processes at engineering scales.
