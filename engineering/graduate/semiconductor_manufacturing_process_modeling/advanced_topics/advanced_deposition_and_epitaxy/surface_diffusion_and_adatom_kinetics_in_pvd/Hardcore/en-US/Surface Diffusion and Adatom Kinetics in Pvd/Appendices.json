This practice guides you through the derivation of a fundamental scaling law that connects the experimentally measurable island density, $N$, to the deposition flux, $F$, diffusion coefficient, $D$, and the microscopic critical nucleus size, $i$ .

In summary, the exponent $\\,m\\,$ primarily encodes $\\,i\\,$ through the relation $\\,m = i/(i+2)\\,$, while capture number variations perturb the prefactor and, to a lesser extent, can bias the inferred $\\,i\\,$ through a small effective $\\,\\delta\\,$ as quantified above.",
