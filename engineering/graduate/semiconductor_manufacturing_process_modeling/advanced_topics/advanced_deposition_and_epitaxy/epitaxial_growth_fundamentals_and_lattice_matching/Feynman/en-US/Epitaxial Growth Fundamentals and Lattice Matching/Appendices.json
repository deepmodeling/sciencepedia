            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the gallium sticking coefficient during the Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) growth of gallium arsenide (GaAs). This will be accomplished by following the prescribed steps: first, determining the areal atomic density of a gallium monolayer from the crystal structure; second, calculating the experimental growth rate from the Reflection High-Energy Electron Diffraction (RHEED) oscillation data; and third, comparing the flux of atoms incorporated into the growing film with the incident gallium flux.\n\nThe fundamental principle is that under gallium-limited growth conditions, the growth rate is controlled by the arrival and incorporation of gallium atoms. The RHEED oscillation period, $T$, provides a direct measure of the time required to complete one monolayer. The sticking coefficient, $s$, is defined as the ratio of the incorporated atomic flux to the incident atomic flux.\n\n1. Determination of the areal atomic density of a gallium $(001)$ monolayer.\nGallium arsenide crystallizes in the zincblende structure, which consists of two interpenetrating face-centered cubic (FCC) sublattices, one for gallium (Ga) and one for arsenic (As), displaced from each other. The problem states that the crystal packing of the FCC cation sublattice determines the monolayer areal atomic density. We therefore consider the arrangement of atoms on a $(001)$ plane of a standard FCC unit cell with lattice parameter $a$.\n\nA two-dimensional unit cell on the $(001)$ surface has an area of $A = a^2$. The atoms in an FCC lattice are located at the corners and face centers of the conventional cubic cell. For a plane at a constant $z$ coordinate, such as the $z=0$ plane, atoms are located at the four corners of the square face and at the center of that face.\nThe number of atoms, $N$, associated with this surface unit cell area is calculated by considering the sharing of atoms with adjacent cells:\n- There is one atom at the face center, which is entirely contained within the unit cell area.\n- There are four atoms at the corners, each of which is shared by four adjacent surface unit cells.\nThus, the total number of atoms per $(001)$ surface unit cell is $N = 1_{\\text{center}} + 4 \\times \\frac{1}{4}_{\\text{corner}} = 2$ atoms.\n\nThe areal atomic density of a single gallium $(001)$ monolayer, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{Ga}}$, is therefore:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{Ga}} = \\frac{N}{A} = \\frac{2}{a^2}\n$$\nThe lattice parameter is given as $a = 5.653\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$. To be consistent with the units of flux ($\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$), we convert $a$ to centimeters: $a = 5.653 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{Ga}} = \\frac{2}{(5.653 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{cm})^2} \\approx \\frac{2}{3.1956 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2} \\approx 6.2586 \\times 10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{atoms}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\n$$\n\n2. Computation of the observed growth rate.\nThe problem states that one RHEED oscillation corresponds to the completion of one single-species $(001)$ monolayer. The measured period is $T = 1.8\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\nThe growth rate in monolayers per second, $R_{\\mathrm{ML}}$, is the reciprocal of the oscillation period:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{ML}} = \\frac{1}{T} = \\frac{1}{1.8\\,\\mathrm{s}} \\approx 0.555... \\,\\mathrm{monolayers}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nTo find the thickness growth rate, $R_h$, we need the thickness of one monolayer. In the zincblende structure, the planes along the $[001]$ direction consist of alternating layers of Ga and As. The Ga atoms form an FCC sublattice, and the planes of this sublattice passing through the conventional unit cell are at $z=0$ and $z=a/2$. The distance between successive planes of the same species (Ga) along the $[001]$ direction is the interplanar spacing $d_{002} = a/2$. Therefore, the thickness added to the film for each completed Ga monolayer is $h_{\\mathrm{ML}} = a/2$.\n$$\nh_{\\mathrm{ML}} = \\frac{a}{2} = \\frac{5.653\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}}{2} = 2.8265\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}\n$$\nConverting to nanometers, $h_{\\mathrm{ML}} = 0.28265\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\nThe thickness growth rate $R_h$ is then:\n$$\nR_h = R_{\\mathrm{ML}} \\times h_{\\mathrm{ML}} = \\frac{1}{T} \\frac{a}{2} = \\frac{1}{1.8\\,\\mathrm{s}} \\times 0.28265\\,\\mathrm{nm} \\approx 0.157\\,\\mathrm{nm}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n\n3. Inference of the gallium sticking coefficient.\nThe sticking coefficient, $s$, is the ratio of the incorporated flux of atoms, $J_{\\mathrm{inc}}$, to the incident flux, $F_{\\mathrm{Ga}}$.\n$$\ns = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{inc}}}{F_{\\mathrm{Ga}}}\n$$\nThe incorporated flux is the number of atoms that become part of the crystal per unit area per unit time. From the RHEED data, we know that one monolayer, with an areal density of $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{Ga}}$, is formed in time $T$. Thus, the incorporated flux is:\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{inc}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{Ga}}}{T}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{Ga}}$ from Part 1:\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{inc}} = \\frac{2}{a^2 T}\n$$\nNow we can write the expression for the sticking coefficient $s$:\n$$\ns = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{inc}}}{F_{\\mathrm{Ga}}} = \\frac{2}{a^2 T F_{\\mathrm{Ga}}}\n$$\nWe are given the following values:\n- Lattice parameter: $a = 5.653\\,\\mathrm{\\AA} = 5.653 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n- RHEED period: $T = 1.8\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n- Incident gallium flux: $F_{\\mathrm{Ga}} = 3.90 \\times 10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{atoms}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $s$:\n$$\ns = \\frac{2}{(5.653 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{cm})^2 \\times (1.8\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\times (3.90 \\times 10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})}\n$$\n$$\ns = \\frac{2}{(3.19564 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2) \\times (7.02 \\times 10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2})}\n$$\n$$\ns = \\frac{2}{3.19564 \\times 7.02 \\times 10^{-1}} = \\frac{2}{2.24334...} \\approx 0.89152\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\ns \\approx 0.892\n$$\nThis value is physically reasonable, as Ga-limited growth implies a high incorporation probability for Ga, and thus a sticking coefficient close to unity.",

Thus, the total free energy for the $3$D state is:\n$$\nF_{3D}(h) = \\gamma_i + \\gamma_f + \\Delta \\gamma_0 + U_{3D}(h)\n$$\nwith\n$$\nU_{3D}(h) = U_{2D}(h_w) + \\alpha \\left[ U_{2D}(h) - U_{2D}(h_w) \\right]\n$$\nThe critical thickness $h_c$ is defined by the condition $F_{2D}(h_c) = F_{3D}(h_c)$:\n$$\n\\gamma_i + \\gamma_f + U_{2D}(h_c) = \\gamma_i + \\gamma_f + \\Delta \\gamma_0 + U_{3D}(h_c)\n$$\nThe surface and interface energy terms $\\gamma_i$ and $\\gamma_f$ cancel, yielding:\n$$\nU_{2D}(h_c) = \\Delta \\gamma_0 + U_{3D}(h_c)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $U_{3D}(h_c)$:\n$$\nU_{2D}(h_c) = \\Delta \\gamma_0 + U_{2D}(h_w) + \\alpha \\left[ U_{2D}(h_c) - U_{2D}(h_w) \\right]\n$$\nWe rearrange the equation to solve for $h_c$:\n$$\nU_{2D}(h_c) (1-\\alpha) = \\Delta \\gamma_0 + U_{2D}(h_w) (1-\\alpha)\n$$\nNow, substitute the derived expression $U_{2D}(h) = \\frac{E f^2}{1-\\nu} h$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{E f^2}{1-\\nu} h_c\\right) (1-\\alpha) = \\Delta \\gamma_0 + \\left(\\frac{E f^2}{1-\\nu} h_w\\right) (1-\\alpha)\n$$\nIsolating the terms containing thickness:\n$$\n\\frac{E f^2 (1-\\alpha)}{1-\\nu} (h_c - h_w) = \\Delta \\gamma_0\n$$\nSolving for $h_c$ gives the final analytic expression:\n$$\nh_c = h_w + \\frac{\\Delta \\gamma_0 (1-\\nu)}{E f^2 (1-\\alpha)}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $h_c$ using the provided parameters, ensuring all are in base SI units.\n- $E = 1.50 \\times 10^{11} \\ \\mathrm{Pa}$\n- $\\nu = 0.30$\n- $f = 0.015$\n- $\\alpha = 0.30$\n- $\\Delta \\gamma_0 = 0.40 \\ \\mathrm{J/m^2}$\n- $h_w = 0.70 \\ \\mathrm{nm} = 0.70 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{m}$\n\nFirst, calculate the dimensionless terms:\n- $1-\\nu = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$\n- $1-\\alpha = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$\n\nSubstitute the values into the derived expression for $h_c$:\n$$\nh_c = 0.70 \\times 10^{-9} + \\frac{(0.40) (0.70)}{(1.50 \\times 10^{11}) (0.015)^2 (0.70)}\n$$\nThe factor of $0.70$ in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n$$\nh_c = 0.70 \\times 10^{-9} + \\frac{0.40}{(1.50 \\times 10^{11}) (0.015)^2}\n$$\nCalculate the denominator:\n$$\n(1.50 \\times 10^{11}) \\times (0.000225) = (1.50 \\times 10^{11}) \\times (2.25 \\times 10^{-4}) = 3.375 \\times 10^{7} \\ \\mathrm{Pa}\n$$\nNow, calculate the fraction:\n$$\n\\frac{0.40 \\ \\mathrm{J/m^2}}{3.375 \\times 10^{7} \\ \\mathrm{Pa}} = \\frac{0.40 \\ \\mathrm{N/m}}{3.375 \\times 10^{7} \\ \\mathrm{N/m^2}} \\approx 1.185185 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\mathrm{m}\n$$\nFinally, calculate $h_c$:\n$$\nh_c = 0.70 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{m} + 1.185185 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\mathrm{m}\n$$\n$$\nh_c = 0.07 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\mathrm{m} + 1.185185 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\mathrm{m} = 1.255185 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe problem requests the answer in nanometers ($\\mathrm{nm}$), so we convert from meters:\n$$\nh_c = 1.255185 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\mathrm{m} \\times \\frac{10^9 \\ \\mathrm{nm}}{1 \\ \\mathrm{m}} = 12.55185 \\ \\mathrm{nm}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\nh_c \\approx 12.55 \\ \\mathrm{nm}\n$$",
