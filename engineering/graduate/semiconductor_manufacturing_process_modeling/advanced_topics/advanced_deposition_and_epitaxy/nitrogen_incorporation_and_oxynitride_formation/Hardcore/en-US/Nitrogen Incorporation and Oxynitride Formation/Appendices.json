A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of Temperature Dependence**\nThe problem states that the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium, where the chemical potential of nitrogen in the gas phase ($\\mu_{\\text{gas}}$) is equal to the chemical potential of nitrogen dissolved in the solid oxide ($\\mu_{\\text{dissolved}}$).\n$$ \\mu_{\\text{gas}} = \\mu_{\\text{dissolved}} $$\nThe chemical potential of an ideal gas is given by:\n$$ \\mu_{\\text{gas}} = \\mu_{\\text{gas}}^{\\circ}(T) + k_{\\text{B}} T \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{\\text{N}}}{p^{\\circ}}\\right) $$\nwhere $\\mu_{\\text{gas}}^{\\circ}(T)$ is the standard chemical potential at the standard pressure $p^{\\circ}$ (typically $1\\,\\text{atm}$), $k_{\\text{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nFor a dilute species dissolved in a solid, the chemical potential is given by:\n$$ \\mu_{\\text{dissolved}} = \\mu_{\\text{dissolved}}^{\\circ}(T) + k_{\\text{B}} T \\ln(\\gamma x) $$\nwhere $\\mu_{\\text{dissolved}}^{\\circ}(T)$ is the standard chemical potential of the dissolved species, $\\gamma$ is the activity coefficient, and $x$ is the mole fraction. The problem states that the solution is dilute and activity coefficients are approximately unity ($\\gamma \\approx 1$). For a very dilute solution, the mole fraction $x$ is directly proportional to the concentration $c$, so we can write this in terms of concentration:\n$$ \\mu_{\\text{dissolved}} \\approx \\mu_{\\text{dissolved}}^{\\circ'}(T) + k_{\\text{B}} T \\ln(c) $$\nwhere $\\mu_{\\text{dissolved}}^{\\circ'}(T)$ is a modified standard potential that absorbs the proportionality constant and standard concentration terms.\n\nAt equilibrium:\n$$ \\mu_{\\text{gas}}^{\\circ}(T) + k_{\\text{B}} T \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{\\text{N}}}{p^{\\circ}}\\right) = \\mu_{\\text{dissolved}}^{\\circ'}(T) + k_{\\text{B}} T \\ln(c) $$\nRearranging to solve for $\\ln(c)$:\n$$ \\ln(c) = \\frac{\\mu_{\\text{gas}}^{\\circ}(T) - \\mu_{\\text{dissolved}}^{\\circ'}(T)}{k_{\\text{B}} T} + \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{\\text{N}}}{p^{\\circ}}\\right) $$\nThe term in the numerator, $\\mu_{\\text{dissolved}}^{\\circ'}(T) - \\mu_{\\text{gas}}^{\\circ}(T)$, is the standard Gibbs free energy of incorporation, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$.\n$$ \\Delta G^{\\circ} = \\Delta H^{\\circ} - T \\Delta S^{\\circ} $$\nwhere $\\Delta H^{\\circ}$ and $\\Delta S^{\\circ}$ are the standard enthalpy and entropy of incorporation, respectively. Substituting this into the equation for $\\ln(c)$:\n$$ \\ln(c) = -\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\circ}}{k_{\\text{B}} T} + \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{\\text{N}}}{p^{\\circ}}\\right) = -\\frac{\\Delta H^{\\circ}}{k_{\\text{B}} T} + \\frac{\\Delta S^{\\circ}}{k_{\\text{B}}} + \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{\\text{N}}}{p^{\\circ}}\\right) $$\nExponentiating both sides:\n$$ c = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta S^{\\circ}}{k_{\\text{B}}}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H^{\\circ}}{k_{\\text{B}} T}\\right) \\frac{p_{\\text{N}}}{p^{\\circ}} $$\nThis equation shows that the concentration $c$ is proportional to the partial pressure $p_{\\text{N}}$, as stated in the problem ($c = H(T)p_{\\text{N}}$). The proportionality constant $H(T)$, known as the Henry's Law constant, is therefore:\n$$ H(T) = \\frac{1}{p^{\\circ}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta S^{\\circ}}{k_{\\text{B}}}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H^{\\circ}}{k_{\\text{B}} T}\\right) $$\nThis expression has the Arrhenius form. The pre-exponential factor $H_0$ given in the problem incorporates the entropy term and the standard pressure scaling:\n$$ H_0 = \\frac{1}{p^{\\circ}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta S^{\\circ}}{k_{\\text{B}}}\\right) $$\nTherefore, the temperature dependence of the proportionality constant is:\n$$ H(T) = H_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H}{k_{\\text{B}} T}\\right) $$\nwhere we use $\\Delta H$ for the standard enthalpy of incorporation as given. This result is consistent with the temperature dependence of an equilibrium constant described by the integrated form of the van 't Hoff equation.\n\n**Calculation of Nitrogen Solubility**\nThe concentration of dissolved nitrogen, $c$, is given by Henry's Law:\n$$ c = H(T) \\cdot p_{\\text{N}} $$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $H(T)$:\n$$ c = H_0 p_{\\text{N}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H}{k_{\\text{B}} T}\\right) $$\nThe given values are:\n-   $H_{0} = 1.2\\times 10^{21}\\,\\text{atoms}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3}\\,\\text{atm}^{-1}$\n-   $p_{\\text{N}} = 0.80\\,\\text{atm}$\n-   $\\Delta H = 1.1\\,\\text{eV}$\n-   $T = 1000\\,\\text{K}$\n-   $k_{\\text{B}} = 8.617333262\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{eV}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, calculate the thermal energy $k_{\\text{B}} T$:\n$$ k_{\\text{B}} T = (8.617333262 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{eV}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}) \\times (1000\\,\\text{K}) = 0.08617333262\\,\\text{eV} $$\nNext, calculate the dimensionless exponent:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta H}{k_{\\text{B}} T} = \\frac{1.1\\,\\text{eV}}{0.08617333262\\,\\text{eV}} \\approx 12.7650519 $$\nNow, substitute these values into the equation for $c$:\n$$ c = (1.2 \\times 10^{21}\\,\\text{atoms}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3}\\,\\text{atm}^{-1}) \\times (0.80\\,\\text{atm}) \\times \\exp(-12.7650519) $$\n$$ c = (0.96 \\times 10^{21}\\,\\text{atoms}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3}) \\times (2.85919 \\times 10^{-6}) $$\n$$ c \\approx 2.74482 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\text{atoms}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3} $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested:\n$$ c \\approx 2.745 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\text{atoms}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3} $$",

The governing partial differential equation (PDE) for the nitrogen concentration $C(x,t)$ is given as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = D\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2} C}{\\partial x^{2}} - k\\,C\n$$\nThe system domain is $x \\in [0, L]$. The initial condition is $C(x,0) = 0$ for $x \\in (0, L)$, and the boundary conditions are $C(0,t) = C_{s}$ and $C(L,t) = 0$ for $t > 0$.\n\nTo analyze the transient behavior, we decompose the concentration profile $C(x,t)$ into a steady-state solution $C_{\\text{ss}}(x)$ and a transient deviation $u(x,t)$:\n$$\nC(x,t) = C_{\\text{ss}}(x) + u(x,t)\n$$\nAt steady state, $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = 0$. The PDE reduces to a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $C_{\\text{ss}}(x)$:\n$$\nD\\,\\frac{d^{2} C_{\\text{ss}}}{d x^{2}} - k\\,C_{\\text{ss}} = 0\n$$\nThe boundary conditions for the steady-state solution are the same as the time-dependent ones: $C_{\\text{ss}}(0) = C_{s}$ and $C_{\\text{ss}}(L) = 0$.\n\nSubstituting the decomposition $C(x,t) = C_{\\text{ss}}(x) + u(x,t)$ back into the original PDE:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} (C_{\\text{ss}}(x) + u(x,t)) = D\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial x^{2}} (C_{\\text{ss}}(x) + u(x,t)) - k\\,(C_{\\text{ss}}(x) + u(x,t))\n$$\nSince $C_{\\text{ss}}(x)$ is not a function of time, $\\frac{\\partial C_{\\text{ss}}}{\\partial t} = 0$. This leads to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = D\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial x^{2}} + D\\,\\frac{d^{2} C_{\\text{ss}}}{d x^{2}} - k\\,u - k\\,C_{\\text{ss}}\n$$\nGrouping the terms, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\left(D\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial x^{2}} - k\\,u\\right) + \\left(D\\,\\frac{d^{2} C_{\\text{ss}}}{d x^{2}} - k\\,C_{\\text{ss}}\\right)\n$$\nThe second term on the right-hand side is zero by the definition of the steady-state solution. Thus, the transient deviation $u(x,t)$ is governed by the homogeneous PDE:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = D\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial x^{2}} - k\\,u\n$$\nThe boundary conditions for $u(x,t)$ are found by subtracting the steady-state boundary conditions:\n$$\nu(0,t) = C(0,t) - C_{\\text{ss}}(0) = C_{s} - C_{s} = 0\n$$\n$$\nu(L,t) = C(L,t) - C_{\\text{ss}}(L) = 0 - 0 = 0\n$$\nWe have a homogeneous PDE with homogeneous boundary conditions. The decay rate of the solution to this problem is governed by the eigenvalues of the linear operator involved. We solve this using the method of separation of variables, letting $u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the PDE for $u(x,t)$:\n$$\nX(x)T'(t) = D\\,X''(x)T(t) - k\\,X(x)T(t)\n$$\nDividing by $D\\,X(x)T(t)$ yields:\n$$\n\\frac{T'(t)}{D\\,T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} - \\frac{k}{D}\n$$\nSince the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side only on $x$, both must be equal to a constant, which we denote as $-\\mu^2$.\n$$\n\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\mu^2 + \\frac{k}{D} \\implies X''(x) + \\left(\\mu^2 - \\frac{k}{D}\\right)X(x) = 0\n$$\nFor consistency with the standard Sturm-Liouville form, let's write the separation as:\n$$\n\\frac{T'(t)}{T(t)} = D\\,\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} - k = -\\lambda\n$$\nThis gives two separate ODEs:\n1. Time-dependent part: $T'(t) + \\lambda T(t) = 0$, with solution $T(t) = T_0 \\exp(-\\lambda t)$.\n2. Space-dependent part: $D\\,X''(x) - k\\,X(x) = -\\lambda X(x)$, which simplifies to $D\\,X''(x) + (\\lambda - k)X(x) = 0$.\n\nThis is an eigenvalue problem for $\\lambda$ with boundary conditions $X(0) = 0$ and $X(L) = 0$. Let's define $\\beta^2 = \\frac{\\lambda - k}{D}$. The spatial ODE becomes:\n$$\nX''(x) + \\beta^2 X(x) = 0\n$$\nThe general solution is $X(x) = A \\sin(\\beta x) + B \\cos(\\beta x)$.\nApplying the boundary condition $X(0) = 0$:\n$$\nA \\sin(0) + B \\cos(0) = 0 \\implies B = 0\n$$\nSo, $X(x) = A \\sin(\\beta x)$.\nApplying the boundary condition $X(L) = 0$:\n$$\nA \\sin(\\beta L) = 0\n$$\nFor a non-trivial solution ($A \\neq 0$), we must have $\\sin(\\beta L) = 0$. This implies $\\beta L = n\\pi$ for any integer $n=1, 2, 3, \\dots$.\nThus, the eigenvalues for $\\beta$ are $\\beta_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}$.\n\nNow we can find the eigenvalues $\\lambda_n$ of the full operator from the definition of $\\beta^2$:\n$$\n\\beta_n^2 = \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\lambda_n - k}{D}\n$$\nSolving for $\\lambda_n$:\n$$\n\\lambda_n = D \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 + k\n$$\nThe decay rate of the transient solution is determined by the set of all eigenvalues $\\{\\lambda_n\\}$. For large times, the term with the smallest eigenvalue, $\\lambda_1$ (corresponding to $n=1$), dominates the decay because it has the longest lifetime. The smallest eigenvalue is:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 = D \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 + k\n$$\nThe problem specifies a Damköhler number $\\text{Da} = \\frac{k L^2}{D} = 1$. From this, we can express the rate constant $k$ as $k = \\frac{D}{L^2}$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\lambda_1$:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 = D \\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2} + \\frac{D}{L^2} = \\frac{D}{L^2} (\\pi^2 + 1)\n$$\nWe are given the numerical values:\n$L = 10.0\\,\\text{nm} = 10.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\text{m}$\n$D = 1.00 \\times 10^{-17}\\,\\text{m}^2/\\text{s}$\n$t_{p} = 3.00\\,\\text{s}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the term $\\frac{D}{L^2}$:\n$$\n\\frac{D}{L^2} = \\frac{1.00 \\times 10^{-17}\\,\\text{m}^2/\\text{s}}{(1.00 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\text{m})^2} = \\frac{1.00 \\times 10^{-17}}{1.00 \\times 10^{-16}}\\,\\text{s}^{-1} = 0.100\\,\\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\nNow, we calculate $\\lambda_1$:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 = 0.100 \\times (\\pi^2 + 1)\\,\\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\nUsing $\\pi \\approx 3.14159265$:\n$$\n\\pi^2 \\approx 9.8696044\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_1 \\approx 0.100 \\times (9.8696044 + 1) = 0.100 \\times 10.8696044 = 1.08696044\\,\\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the value of $E(t_{p}) = \\exp(-\\lambda_{1}\\,t_{p})$. We compute the exponent:\n$$\n-\\lambda_1 t_p \\approx - (1.08696044\\,\\text{s}^{-1}) \\times (3.00\\,\\text{s}) = -3.26088132\n$$\nFinally, we calculate $E(t_{p})$:\n$$\nE(t_{p}) = \\exp(-3.26088132) \\approx 0.0383563\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The first three significant figures are $3$, $8$, and $3$. The following digit is $5$, so we round up the last significant digit.\n$$\nE(t_{p}) \\approx 0.0384\n$$\nThis value represents the decay factor of the slowest transient mode after a process time of $t_p = 3.00\\,\\text{s}$.",
