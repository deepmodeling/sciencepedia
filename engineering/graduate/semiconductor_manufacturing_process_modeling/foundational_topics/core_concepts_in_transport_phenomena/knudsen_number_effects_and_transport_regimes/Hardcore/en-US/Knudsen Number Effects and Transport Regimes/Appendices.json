Consider a fixed gas species whose effective molecular diameter is constant and independent of thermodynamic state. The reactor operates isothermally, and the gas obeys the Ideal Gas Law. The mean free path is defined as the average distance a molecule travels between collisions under binary-collision conditions in a dilute gas.

It is based on established principles of kinetic theory and the Ideal Gas Law, with a clear and consistent setup. The problem requires a standard derivation followed by a direct calculation, both of which are central to the study of transport phenomena in low-pressure gas systems relevant to semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nThe solution is divided into two parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of the Scaling of Mean Free Path ($\\lambda$)**\n\nThe mean free path, $\\lambda$, for a dilute gas composed of hard-sphere molecules is given by the expression from kinetic theory:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} \\pi d^2 n} $$\nwhere $d$ is the effective molecular diameter and $n$ is the number density of the gas molecules (number of molecules per unit volume).\n\nThe problem states that the gas obeys the Ideal Gas Law, which is expressed as:\n$$ pV = N_m k_B T $$\nHere, $p$ is the gas pressure, $V$ is the volume, $N_m$ is the total number of molecules in the volume $V$, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe number density $n$ is defined as the number of molecules per unit volume:\n$$ n = \\frac{N_m}{V} $$\n\nBy rearranging the Ideal Gas Law, we can express the number density $n$ in terms of pressure and temperature:\n$$ \\frac{N_m}{V} = \\frac{p}{k_B T} \\implies n = \\frac{p}{k_B T} $$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $n$ into the equation for the mean free path $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} \\pi d^2 \\left(\\frac{p}{k_B T}\\right)} $$\nSimplifying this expression yields:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{k_B T}{\\sqrt{2} \\pi d^2 p} $$\n\nFor a fixed gas species, the molecular diameter $d$ is a constant. The Boltzmann constant $k_B$ and $\\pi$ are also constants. Therefore, we can express the relationship between $\\lambda$, $T$, and $p$ as a proportionality:\n$$ \\lambda \\propto \\frac{T}{p} $$\nThis result shows that the mean free path is directly proportional to the absolute temperature and inversely proportional to the pressure.\n\n**Task 2: Calculation of the Multiplicative Factor ($F$)**\n\nThe Knudsen number, $\\mathrm{Kn}$, is defined as the ratio of the mean free path $\\lambda$ to a characteristic length $L$:\n$$ \\mathrm{Kn} = \\frac{\\lambda}{L} $$\nUsing the scaling derived in Task 1, we can write the scaling for the Knudsen number:\n$$ \\mathrm{Kn} \\propto \\frac{T}{pL} $$\n\nWe are asked to compute the factor $F$, which is the ratio of the Knudsen number at pressure $p_2 = 1\\ \\text{Torr}$ to the Knudsen number at pressure $p_1 = 100\\ \\text{mTorr}$. Let these Knudsen numbers be $\\mathrm{Kn}_2$ and $\\mathrm{Kn}_1$, respectively.\n$$ F \\equiv \\frac{\\mathrm{Kn}_2}{\\mathrm{Kn}_1} $$\n\nThe problem specifies that the process is isothermal, so the temperature $T$ is constant ($T_1 = T_2 = T$). The characteristic length $L$ is also constant. Using the proportionality, we can write the ratio as:\n$$ F = \\frac{\\frac{C T_2}{p_2 L}}{\\frac{C T_1}{p_1 L}} $$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of proportionality, $C = \\frac{k_B}{\\sqrt{2} \\pi d^2}$.\nSince $T_1 = T_2$ and $L$ is constant, the terms $C$, $T$, and $L$ cancel out, leaving a simple ratio of pressures:\n$$ F = \\frac{p_1}{p_2} $$\n\nThe given pressure values are:\n- $p_1 = 100\\ \\text{mTorr}$\n- $p_2 = 1\\ \\text{Torr}$\n\nTo compute the ratio, the pressures must be in the same units. We use the conversion factor $1\\ \\text{Torr} = 1000\\ \\text{mTorr}$.\n$$ p_2 = 1\\ \\text{Torr} = 1000\\ \\text{mTorr} $$\n\nNow, we can substitute the numerical values into the expression for $F$:\n$$ F = \\frac{100\\ \\text{mTorr}}{1000\\ \\text{mTorr}} = \\frac{100}{1000} = \\frac{1}{10} $$\nTherefore, the multiplicative factor is $0.1$. The values for temperature ($T=300\\ \\text{K}$) and characteristic length ($L=1\\ \\text{mm}$) are consistent with a physical scenario but are not needed for the calculation of this specific dimensionless ratio.",

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of fluid mechanics, specifically rarefied gas dynamics and microfluidics. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information and conditions to arrive at a unique, meaningful solution. The parameters given (channel height, mean free path, TMAC) are physically realistic for a microscale gas flow problem in a semiconductor manufacturing context. No internal contradictions, ambiguities, or factual unsoundness were detected. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the volumetric flow rate with first-order velocity slip, $Q_{\\text{slip}}$, to the classical no-slip Poiseuille flow rate, $Q_{0}$. The flow is modeled as a steady, incompressible, fully developed, laminar flow between two infinite parallel plates separated by a distance $h$.\n\nLet us establish a coordinate system where the $x$-axis is aligned with the direction of flow, and the $y$-axis is perpendicular to the plates, with $y=0$ at the centerline of the channel. The walls are located at $y = \\pm \\frac{h}{2}$. For fully developed flow, the axial velocity $u$ is a function of $y$ only, i.e., $u=u(y)$. The momentum balance in the $x$-direction simplifies the Navier-Stokes equations to:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 u}{dy^2} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the gas and $\\frac{dp}{dx}$ is the constant pressure gradient along the channel. Given a pressure drop $\\Delta p$ over a length $L$, the pressure gradient is $\\frac{dp}{dx} = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{L}$. Thus, the governing equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 u}{dy^2} = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{\\mu L} $$\n\nFirst, we solve for the classical no-slip case to find $Q_0$. The boundary conditions are $u_0(y=\\pm \\frac{h}{2}) = 0$. Integrating the governing equation twice with respect to $y$ yields:\n$$ \\frac{du_0}{dy} = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{\\mu L} y + C_1 $$\n$$ u_0(y) = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{2\\mu L} y^2 + C_1 y + C_2 $$\nDue to the symmetry of the flow profile about the centerline, the velocity profile must be an even function of $y$, which implies $C_1 = 0$. Applying the no-slip condition at the upper wall, $u_0(\\frac{h}{2}) = 0$:\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{2\\mu L} \\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right)^2 + C_2 \\implies C_2 = \\frac{\\Delta p h^2}{8\\mu L} $$\nThe no-slip velocity profile is therefore:\n$$ u_0(y) = \\frac{\\Delta p}{2\\mu L} \\left( \\frac{h^2}{4} - y^2 \\right) $$\nThe volumetric flow rate per unit width, $Q'_0$, is obtained by integrating this profile from wall to wall:\n$$ Q'_0 = \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} u_0(y) \\,dy = \\frac{\\Delta p}{2\\mu L} \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\left( \\frac{h^2}{4} - y^2 \\right) \\,dy $$\n$$ Q'_0 = \\frac{\\Delta p}{2\\mu L} \\left[ \\frac{h^2}{4}y - \\frac{y^3}{3} \\right]_{-h/2}^{h/2} = \\frac{\\Delta p}{2\\mu L} \\left( 2 \\left( \\frac{h^3}{8} - \\frac{h^3}{24} \\right) \\right) = \\frac{\\Delta p h^3}{12\\mu L} $$\n\nNext, we solve for the slip-flow case to find $Q_{\\text{slip}}$. The governing equation and general solution form remain the same. However, the boundary conditions are now the first-order Maxwell velocity-slip conditions. At the wall ($y=\\pm \\frac{h}{2}$), the gas has a finite slip velocity, $u_s$. At the upper wall ($y=\\frac{h}{2}$), the condition is:\n$$ u_s = u_{\\text{slip}}\\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right) = -b \\left. \\frac{du_{\\text{slip}}}{dy} \\right|_{y=h/2} $$\nwhere $b$ is the slip length, given by $b = \\left(\\frac{2-\\sigma}{\\sigma}\\right)\\lambda$.\nFrom the general solution $u_{\\text{slip}}(y) = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{2\\mu L} y^2 + C_2$ (with $C_1=0$ from symmetry), we find the derivative:\n$$ \\frac{du_{\\text{slip}}}{dy} = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{\\mu L} y \\implies \\left. \\frac{du_{\\text{slip}}}{dy} \\right|_{y=h/2} = -\\frac{\\Delta p h}{2\\mu L} $$\nSubstituting this into the slip condition gives the slip velocity at the wall:\n$$ u_s = -b \\left( -\\frac{\\Delta p h}{2\\mu L} \\right) = \\frac{b \\Delta p h}{2\\mu L} $$\nThe velocity at the wall is also given by the general solution:\n$$ u_{\\text{slip}}\\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{2\\mu L} \\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right)^2 + C_2 = -\\frac{\\Delta p h^2}{8\\mu L} + C_2 $$\nEquating the two expressions for $u_{\\text{slip}}(\\frac{h}{2})$ allows us to solve for $C_2$:\n$$ \\frac{b \\Delta p h}{2\\mu L} = -\\frac{\\Delta p h^2}{8\\mu L} + C_2 \\implies C_2 = \\frac{\\Delta p}{2\\mu L} \\left( bh + \\frac{h^2}{4} \\right) $$\nThe slip velocity profile is:\n$$ u_{\\text{slip}}(y) = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{2\\mu L} y^2 + \\frac{\\Delta p}{2\\mu L} \\left( bh + \\frac{h^2}{4} \\right) = \\frac{\\Delta p}{2\\mu L} \\left( \\frac{h^2}{4} - y^2 + bh \\right) $$\nThe volumetric flow rate per unit width with a slip, $Q'_{\\text{slip}}$, is:\n$$ Q'_{\\text{slip}} = \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} u_{\\text{slip}}(y) \\,dy = \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\left[ \\frac{\\Delta p}{2\\mu L} \\left( \\frac{h^2}{4} - y^2 \\right) + \\frac{\\Delta p b h}{2\\mu L} \\right] \\,dy $$\n$$ Q'_{\\text{slip}} = \\underbrace{\\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} u_0(y) \\,dy}_{Q'_0} + \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\frac{\\Delta p b h}{2\\mu L} \\,dy $$\n$$ Q'_{\\text{slip}} = Q'_0 + \\frac{\\Delta p b h}{2\\mu L} [y]_{-h/2}^{h/2} = Q'_0 + \\frac{\\Delta p b h^2}{2\\mu L} $$\nThe correction factor is the ratio $Q_{\\text{slip}}/Q_0$. Since the channel width $W$ is a constant factor for both $Q_{\\text{slip}}=W Q'_{\\text{slip}}$ and $Q_0=W Q'_0$, the ratio simplifies to $Q'_{\\text{slip}}/Q'_0$.\n$$ \\frac{Q_{\\text{slip}}}{Q_0} = \\frac{Q'_0 + \\frac{\\Delta p b h^2}{2\\mu L}}{Q'_0} = 1 + \\frac{\\frac{\\Delta p b h^2}{2\\mu L}}{Q'_0} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $Q'_0 = \\frac{\\Delta p h^3}{12\\mu L}$:\n$$ \\frac{Q_{\\text{slip}}}{Q_0} = 1 + \\frac{\\frac{\\Delta p b h^2}{2\\mu L}}{\\frac{\\Delta p h^3}{12\\mu L}} = 1 + \\frac{b h^2}{2} \\cdot \\frac{12}{h^3} = 1 + \\frac{6b}{h} $$\nNow, we substitute the given expression for the slip length, $b = \\left(\\frac{2-\\sigma}{\\sigma}\\right)\\lambda$:\n$$ \\frac{Q_{\\text{slip}}}{Q_0} = 1 + \\frac{6}{h} \\left(\\frac{2-\\sigma}{\\sigma}\\right)\\lambda = 1 + 6 \\left(\\frac{2-\\sigma}{\\sigma}\\right) \\frac{\\lambda}{h} $$\nThe dimensionless group $\\frac{\\lambda}{h}$ is the Knudsen number, $Kn$.
