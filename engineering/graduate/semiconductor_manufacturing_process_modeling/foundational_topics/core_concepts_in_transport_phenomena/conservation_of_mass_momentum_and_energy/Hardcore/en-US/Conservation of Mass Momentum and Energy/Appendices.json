            "problem": "An isothermal low-pressure chemical vapor deposition reactor used in semiconductor manufacturing is modeled as a rigid, well-mixed control volume of gas with constant volume $V$. The reactor is connected to a very large upstream reservoir through a straight, horizontal tube of length $L$ and uniform cross-sectional area $A$. The gas in both the reservoir and the reactor is an ideal mixture at the same uniform temperature $T$. Initially, at time $t=0$, the system is at rest with uniform pressure $p(0)=P_{\\mathrm{res}}$ and zero flow velocity everywhere in the tube.\n\nAt $t=0^{+}$, a surface reaction begins that removes gas-phase moles from the reactor at a constant net molar rate $R_{\\mathrm{dep}}$ (moles per second), representing precursor consumption by deposition. The reservoir pressure $P_{\\mathrm{res}}$ remains constant for all $t \\ge 0$. The gas can flow from the reservoir into the reactor through the tube in response to any pressure difference that arises.\n\nAssume:\n- The ideal gas law holds with the universal gas constant $R_{u}$.\n- The reactor is rigid and isothermal, so $V$ and $T$ are constant.\n- The gas in the tube can be modeled as a uniform plug flow of density $\\rho(t)$ and cross-sectional average velocity $u(t)$; for the initial transient on a vanishingly small time interval after $t=0$, take $\\rho(t) \\approx \\rho(0)$.\n- The momentum equation for the gas in the tube is governed by one-dimensional integral conservation of momentum with no wall friction and negligible gravitational head. Thus, the pressure force difference between the reservoir and reactor acts to accelerate the gas slug in the tube.\n- The reactor is large enough and the initial transient is short enough that the composition changes do not significantly change $\\rho(0)$ or $T$.\n\nUsing only global conservation of mass for the reactor control volume, the ideal gas law, and the one-dimensional integral momentum balance for the tube, determine the initial time derivative of the reactor pressure, $\\left.\\dfrac{dp}{dt}\\right|_{t=0^{+}}$, caused by the onset of deposition and the associated transient momentum response of the connecting tube.\n\nUse the following parameter values:\n- $V = 0.020\\ \\mathrm{m^{3}}$,\n- $T = 1000\\ \\mathrm{K}$,\n- $P_{\\mathrm{res}} = 400\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$,\n- $L = 0.50\\ \\mathrm{m}$,\n- $A = 1.00 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}}$,\n- $R_{\\mathrm{dep}} = 2.00 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ s^{-1}}$,\n- $R_{u} = 8.314462618\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}$.\n\nExpress your final answer for $\\left.\\dfrac{dp}{dt}\\right|_{t=0^{+}}$ in $\\mathrm{Pa\\ s^{-1}}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the initial time derivative of the reactor pressure, $\\left.\\dfrac{dp}{dt}\\right|_{t=0^{+}}$, immediately following the start of a deposition reaction. To find this, we must establish the governing equations for the system based on the principles of conservation of mass and momentum, along with the ideal gas law.\n\nLet $p(t)$ be the pressure in the reactor, $n(t)$ be the number of moles of gas in the reactor, and $u(t)$ be the velocity of the gas in the connecting tube. The reactor volume $V$ and temperature $T$ are constant.\n\nFirst, we apply the principle of conservation of mass to the reactor control volume. The rate of change of moles in the reactor, $\\dfrac{dn}{dt}$, is equal to the molar rate of gas flowing in from the tube, $\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{in}}$, minus the molar rate of gas consumed by the deposition reaction, $R_{\\mathrm{dep}}$.\n$$\n\\frac{dn}{dt} = \\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{in}} - R_{\\mathrm{dep}}\n$$\nThe inflow rate $\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{in}}$ is the product of the gas's molar density $(\\rho(t)/M)$ and its volumetric flow rate $(A u(t))$, where $\\rho(t)$ is the gas density in the tube, $M$ is the molar mass, $A$ is the tube's cross-sectional area, and $u(t)$ is the gas velocity.\n$$\n\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\frac{\\rho(t)}{M} A u(t)\n$$\nThus, the molar balance is:\n$$\n\\frac{dn}{dt} = \\frac{\\rho(t) A u(t)}{M} - R_{\\mathrm{dep}}\n$$\nNext, we relate the number of moles $n(t)$ to the pressure $p(t)$ using the ideal gas law for the reactor volume $V$:\n$$\np(t)V = n(t)R_u T\n$$\nSince $V$, $R_u$, and $T$ are constants, we can differentiate with respect to time to relate the rate of change of pressure to the rate of change of moles:\n$$\nV\\frac{dp}{dt} = R_u T \\frac{dn}{dt}\n$$\nSubstituting the molar balance equation into this expression yields the first governing differential equation for the reactor pressure:\n$$\nV\\frac{dp}{dt} = R_u T \\left(\\frac{\\rho(t) A u(t)}{M} - R_{\\mathrm{dep}}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{\\rho(t) R_u T}{M}\\right) A u(t) - R_u T R_{\\mathrm{dep}}\n$$\nThe problem states that for the initial transient, we can approximate the gas density in the tube as constant, $\\rho(t) \\approx \\rho(0)$. At time $t=0$, the entire system is at pressure $P_{\\mathrm{res}}$ and temperature $T$. The ideal gas law for the gas at this initial state gives $P_{\\mathrm{res}} = \\frac{\\rho(0)}{M}R_u T$. The term in the parentheses can therefore be approximated as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\rho(t) R_u T}{M} \\approx \\frac{\\rho(0) R_u T}{M} = P_{\\mathrm{res}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the equation for $\\dfrac{dp}{dt}$ gives our first dynamic equation, valid for the initial transient:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dt} = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{res}} A}{V} u(t) - \\frac{R_u T R_{\\mathrm{dep}}}{V} \\quad (* A)\n$$\nSecond, we apply the one-dimensional integral conservation of momentum to the slug of gas within the tube of length $L$ and area $A$. The net force on the gas is the difference in pressure forces at the inlet (reservoir pressure $P_{\\mathrm{res}}$) and the outlet (reactor pressure $p(t)$). This net force equals the rate of change of momentum of the gas slug.\n$$\n\\sum F = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\text{momentum})\n$$\n$$\n(P_{\\mathrm{res}} - p(t)) A = \\frac{d}{dt}(m_{\\mathrm{tube}} u(t))\n$$\nThe mass of the gas in the tube, $m_{\\mathrm{tube}}$, is the product of its density and volume, $m_{\\mathrm{tube}} = \\rho(t) A L$. Using the assumption $\\rho(t) \\approx \\rho(0)$, the mass is constant: $m_{\\mathrm{tube}} \\approx \\rho(0) A L$.\n$$\n(P_{\\mathrm{res}} - p(t)) A = (\\rho(0) A L) \\frac{du}{dt}\n$$\nThis gives our second dynamic equation, governing the gas acceleration:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dt} = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{res}} - p(t)}{\\rho(0) L} \\quad (* B)\n$$\nWe need to find the value of $\\left.\\dfrac{dp}{dt}\\right|_{t=0^{+}}$. This is found by evaluating Equation $(* A)$ at the limit $t \\to 0^{+}$.\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{dp}{dt}\\right|_{t=0^{+}} = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{res}} A}{V} u(0^{+}) - \\frac{R_u T R_{\\mathrm{dep}}}{V}\n$$\nTo evaluate this, we need the value of the velocity $u(0^{+})$. The initial state of the system at $t=0$ is rest, so $u(0)=0$. The momentum equation $(* B)$ shows that the acceleration $\\dfrac{du}{dt}$ is driven by the pressure difference $P_{\\mathrm{res}} - p(t)$, which is finite. A finite acceleration implies that the velocity $u(t)$ must be a continuous function of time. Therefore, the velocity immediately after the transient begins must be equal to the velocity just before:\n$$\nu(0^{+}) = u(0) = 0\n$$\nSubstituting $u(0^{+})=0$ into the expression for $\\left.\\dfrac{dp}{dt}\\right|_{t=0^{+}}$:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{dp}{dt}\\right|_{t=0^{+}} = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{res}} A}{V} (0) - \\frac{R_u T R_{\\mathrm{dep}}}{V} = -\\frac{R_u T R_{\\mathrm{dep}}}{V}\n$$\nThis result indicates that at the very instant the deposition reaction begins ($t=0^+$), the pressure starts to drop solely due to the consumption of moles within the reactor. The inflow of gas has not yet begun ($u(0^+)=0$), as the gas in the tube requires a finite amount of time to accelerate in response to the nascent pressure difference. Thus, the parameters related to the momentum response ($L$, $A$, $P_{\\mathrm{res}}$) do not appear in the final expression for the initial rate of pressure change, even though the momentum equation is essential for correctly establishing that $u(0^+) = 0$.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$R_u = 8.314462618\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}$\n$T = 1000\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n$R_{\\mathrm{dep}} = 2.00 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ s^{-1}}$\n$V = 0.020\\ \\mathrm{m^{3}}$\n\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{dp}{dt}\\right|_{t=0^{+}} = - \\frac{(8.314462618\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}) (1000\\ \\mathrm{K}) (2.00 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ s^{-1}})}{0.020\\ \\mathrm{m^{3}}}\n$$\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{dp}{dt}\\right|_{t=0^{+}} = - \\frac{0.166289\\dots\\ \\mathrm{J\\ s^{-1}}}{0.020\\ \\mathrm{m^{3}}}\n$$\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{dp}{dt}\\right|_{t=0^{+}} = -8.31446\\dots\\ \\mathrm{Pa\\ s^{-1}}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $-8.314\\ \\mathrm{Pa\\ s^{-1}}$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the ratio of the average viscous dissipation to the average magnitude of the pressure-work term for a steady, fully developed, pressure-driven flow between two parallel plates. We begin by deriving the velocity profile and the pressure gradient.\n\nThe flow is described as steady ($\\partial/\\partial t = 0$) and fully developed in the $x$-direction. The velocity vector is thus purely in the $x$-direction and is a function of the cross-stream coordinate $y$ only, i.e., $\\mathbf{u} = (u(y), 0, 0)$. For an incompressible or low-Mach number flow, the continuity equation $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$ is automatically satisfied as $\\partial u / \\partial x = 0$.\n\nThe momentum equation in the $x$-direction for a Newtonian fluid reduces significantly under these conditions.

The Laplacian $\\nabla^2 u$ simplifies to $\\frac{d^2 u}{dy^2}$ because derivatives with respect to $x$ and $z$ are zero.\n\nThe $x$-momentum equation simplifies to the classic Poiseuille flow equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 u}{dy^2} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}\n$$\nSince the left side depends only on $y$, the pressure gradient $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}$ must be a constant.

The equation simplifies by grouping terms containing $(T_{g} - T_{0})$:\n$$\nP_{\\text{abs}} = \\left( \\frac{k A_{\\text{cond}}}{L} + \\dot{m} c_{p} \\right) (T_{g} - T_{0}) + \\varepsilon \\sigma A_{\\text{rad}} (T_{g}^{4} - T_{0}^{4})\n$$\nWe now calculate the numerical values of the coefficients using the provided data.\nThe coefficient for the linear heat loss terms (conduction and convection/flow) is:\n$$\nC_{1} = \\frac{k A_{\\text{cond}}}{L} + \\dot{m} c_{p} = \\frac{(1.4 \\text{ W m}^{-1}\\text{K}^{-1})(0.10 \\text{ m}^2)}{0.020 \\text{ m}} + (1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ kg s}^{-1})(520 \\text{ J kg}^{-1}\\text{K}^{-1})\n$$\n$$\nC_{1} = 7.0 \\text{ W K}^{-1} + 0.052 \\text{ W K}^{-1} = 7.052 \\text{ W K}^{-1}\n$$\nThe coefficient for the radiative heat loss term is:\n$$\nC_{2} = \\varepsilon \\sigma A_{\\text{rad}} = (0.05)(5.670374419 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ W m}^{-2}\\text{K}^{-4})(0.50 \\text{ m}^2)\n$$\n$$\nC_{2} \\approx 1.41759 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ W K}^{-4}\n$$\nSubstituting the known values and coefficients into the energy balance equation:\n$$\n1000 = 7.052 (T_{g} - 300) + (1.41759 \\times 10^{-9}) (T_{g}^{4} - 300^{4})\n$$\nThis is a nonlinear algebraic equation (a quartic equation) for $T_{g}$. It must be solved numerically. We seek the physically relevant root where $T_{g}  300 \\text{ K}$.\nLet $f(T_g) = 7.052 (T_{g} - 300) + (1.41759 \\times 10^{-9}) (T_{g}^{4} - 300^{4}) - 1000 = 0$.\nWe can solve this equation using an iterative numerical method or a solver. A first approximation ignoring radiation gives $1000 = 7.052(T_g - 300)$, which yields $T_g \\approx 441.8 \\text{ K}$. Using this as a starting point for iteration:\nTest $T_{g} = 436.17 \\text{ K}$:\n$$\nf(436.17) = 7.052(136.17) + (1.41759 \\times 10^{-9})(436.17^4 - 300^4) - 1000\n$$\n$$\nf(436.17) = 960.18 + (1.41759 \\times 10^{-9})(3.6168 \\times 10^{10} - 8.1 \\times 10^{9}) - 1000\n$$\n$$\nf(436.17) = 960.18 + 39.79 - 1000 = 999.97 - 1000 \\approx -0.03 \\text{ W}\n$$\nTest $T_g = 436.18 \\text{ K}$:\n$$\nf(436.18) = 7.052(136.18) + (1.41759 \\times 10^{-9})(436.18^4 - 300^4) - 1000\n$$\n$$\nf(436.18) = 960.25 + (1.41759 \\times 10^{-9})(3.6177 \\times 10^{10} - 8.1 \\times 10^{9}) - 1000\n$$\n$$\nf(436.18) = 960.25 + 39.80 - 1000 = 1000.05 - 1000 \\approx +0.05 \\text{ W}\n$$\nThe solution for $T_{g}$ lies between $436.17 \\text{ K}$ and $436.18 \\text{ K}$. By linear interpolation, the value is closer to $436.17 \\text{ K}$. Solving with higher precision yields $T_g \\approx 436.173 \\text{ K}$.\nThe problem requires rounding the final result to four significant figures.\n$$\nT_{g} \\approx 436.2 \\text{ K}\n$$",
