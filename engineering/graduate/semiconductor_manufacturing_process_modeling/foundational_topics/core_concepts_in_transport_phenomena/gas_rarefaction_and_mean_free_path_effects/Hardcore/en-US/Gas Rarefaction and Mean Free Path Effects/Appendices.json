            "problem": "In a cryogenic plasma etch module used in semiconductor manufacturing, argon is the dominant background gas.

            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and self-contained. All provided parameters and physical constants are appropriate for the context of gas rarefaction in a cryogenic semiconductor processing environment. The physical models described, namely the Kinetic Theory of Gases (KTG), the ideal gas law, and its correction via the second virial coefficient for a van der Waals gas, are standard and correctly stated. The problem is therefore valid, and a solution may be constructed.\n\nThe problem requires two tasks: first, to derive the pressure dependence of the mean free path for an ideal gas, and second, to calculate the fractional error in this ideal-gas value compared to a more realistic non-ideal gas model.\n\nFirst, we address the derivation of the ideal-gas mean free path, $\\lambda_{\\text{ideal}}$. The mean free path $\\lambda$ is given by the KTG definition:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}\\,\\pi\\,d^{2}\\,n} $$\nwhere $d$ is the effective molecular diameter and $n$ is the number density of the gas molecules. For an ideal gas, the relationship between pressure $p$, number density $n$, and absolute temperature $T$ is given by the ideal gas law:\n$$ p = n\\,k_{B}\\,T $$\nwhere $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant. To find the pressure dependence of $\\lambda$, we first solve the ideal gas law for the number density $n$:\n$$ n_{\\text{ideal}} = \\frac{p}{k_{B}\\,T} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $n_{\\text{ideal}}$ into the KTG formula for $\\lambda$ yields the expression for the mean free path under the ideal gas assumption:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\text{ideal}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}\\,\\pi\\,d^{2}\\,\\left(\\frac{p}{k_{B}\\,T}\\right)} $$\nSimplifying this expression gives the explicit pressure dependence of the mean free path for an ideal gas:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\text{ideal}} = \\frac{k_{B}\\,T}{\\sqrt{2}\\,\\pi\\,d^{2}\\,p} $$\nThis expression shows that, for an ideal gas at constant temperature, the mean free path is inversely proportional to the pressure.\n\nNext, we calculate the fractional error $E$ incurred by using the ideal-gas expression for $\\lambda$ instead of the more accurate non-ideal, or real, expression. The fractional error is defined as:\n$$ E = \\left|\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{ideal}}-\\lambda_{\\text{real}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{real}}}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{ideal}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{real}}} - 1\\right| $$\nFrom the KTG definition, $\\lambda$ is inversely proportional to the number density $n$ ($\\lambda \\propto 1/n$). Therefore, the ratio of the mean free paths is the inverse of the ratio of the number densities:\n$$ \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{ideal}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{real}}} = \\frac{n_{\\text{real}}}{n_{\\text{ideal}}} $$\nFor the real gas, the pressure is described by the compressibility factor $Z$:\n$$ p = n_{\\text{real}}\\,k_{B}\\,T\\,Z $$\nfrom which we find the real gas number density:\n$$ n_{\\text{real}} = \\frac{p}{k_{B}\\,T\\,Z} $$\nThe ratio of the number densities is then:\n$$ \\frac{n_{\\text{real}}}{n_{\\text{ideal}}} = \\frac{p/(k_{B}\\,T\\,Z)}{p/(k_{B}\\,T)} = \\frac{1}{Z} $$\nThus, the fractional error $E$ can be expressed in terms of the compressibility factor $Z$:\n$$ E = \\left|\\frac{1}{Z} - 1\\right| = \\left|\\frac{1-Z}{Z}\\right| $$\nThe problem provides a low-density approximation for $Z$ based on the second virial coefficient, $B(T)$:\n$$ Z \\approx 1 + B(T)\\,\\frac{p}{R\\,T} $$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant.

It describes a classic scenario in vacuum science and kinetic theory of gases. The assumptions provided—molecular flow regime, negligibly thick orifice, and uniform temperature—are standard for simplifying the problem to a solvable form that still captures the essential physics. All necessary parameters and constants for both the derivation and the numerical calculation are provided. The problem does not violate any scientific principles, is not ambiguous, and does not contain contradictory information.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation\nIn the free-molecular flow regime, the gas molecules move independently of one another. The transport of gas through the orifice is the net result of two independent one-way flows: molecules from chamber $1$ passing into chamber $2$, and molecules from chamber $2$ passing into chamber $1$. Since the orifice is thin, any molecule entering it from one side is assumed to pass through to the other side without collision.\n\nThe rate of passage of molecules through the orifice is determined by the molecular impingement rate, or flux $\\Phi$, which is the number of molecules striking a surface per unit area per unit time. To derive this, we begin with the Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution for a gas in thermal equilibrium. Let the orifice lie in the $xy$-plane. The number of molecules per unit volume with velocity components in the range $(v_x, v_y, v_z)$ to $(v_x+dv_x, v_y+dv_y, v_z+dv_z)$ is given by $n f(\\vec{v}) d^3v$, where $n$ is the number density of molecules and $f(\\vec{v})$ is the normalized velocity distribution function:\n$$f(\\vec{v}) = \\left(\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T}\\right)^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m(v_x^2+v_y^2+v_z^2)}{2k_B T}\\right)$$\nHere, $m$ is the mass of a single molecule, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe number of molecules with velocity $\\vec{v}$ that cross an area element $A$ in the $xy$-plane from the $z0$ side in a time interval $dt$ is equal to the number of such molecules contained in a cylinder of base area $A$ and height $v_z dt$. This requires $v_z > 0$. The volume of this cylinder is $A v_z dt$.\nThe number of such molecules is $(n f(\\vec{v}) d^3v) (A v_z dt)$. The molecular flux $\\Phi$ (number per unit area per unit time) is obtained by integrating over all possible velocities of molecules that will cross the surface, i.e., $-\\infty  v_x  \\infty$, $-\\infty  v_y  \\infty$, and $0  v_z  \\infty$.\n$$\\Phi = \\int_0^\\infty \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty n v_z f(\\vec{v}) dv_x dv_y dv_z$$\nSubstituting the expression for $f(\\vec{v})$:\n$$\\Phi = n \\left(\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T}\\right)^{3/2} \\int_0^\\infty v_z \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv_z^2}{2k_B T}\\right) dv_z \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv_y^2}{2k_B T}\\right) dv_y \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv_x^2}{2k_B T}\\right) dv_x$$\nThe integrals over $v_x$ and $v_y$ are standard Gaussian integrals of the form $\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\exp(-ax^2)dx = \\sqrt{\\pi/a}$. Here, $a = m/(2k_B T)$, so each integral evaluates to $\\sqrt{2\\pi k_B T/m}$.\nThe integral over $v_z$ is evaluated by substitution. Let $u = mv_z^2/(2k_B T)$, then $du = (mv_z/k_B T)dv_z$, so $v_z dv_z = (k_B T/m)du$.\n$$\\int_0^\\infty v_z \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv_z^2}{2k_B T}\\right) dv_z = \\frac{k_B T}{m} \\int_0^\\infty \\exp(-u) du = \\frac{k_B T}{m} [- \\exp(-u)]_0^\\infty = \\frac{k_B T}{m}$$\nCombining these results:\n$$\\Phi = n \\left(\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T}\\right)^{3/2} \\left(\\frac{k_B T}{m}\\right) \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi k_B T}{m}}\\right) \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2pi k_B T}{m}}\\right) = n \\left(\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T}\\right)^{3/2} \\left(\\frac{k_B T}{m}\\right) \\left(\\frac{2\\pi k_B T}{m}\\right)$$\n$$\\Phi = n \\left(\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T}\\right)^{1/2} \\frac{k_B T}{m} = n \\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T}{2\\pi m}}$$\nThis expression can be related to the mean molecular speed, $\\bar{c}$. The mean speed is given by the Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distribution as:\n$$\\bar{c} = \\sqrt{\\frac{8k_B T}{\\pi m}}$$\nRearranging for $\\sqrt{k_B T/m}$: $\\sqrt{k_B T/m} = \\bar{c}\\sqrt{\\pi/8}$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\Phi$:\n$$\\Phi = n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T}{m}} = n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\left(\\bar{c}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{8}}\\right) = n \\bar{c} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{16}} = \\frac{1}{4} n \\bar{c}$$\nThis is the Hertz-Knudsen equation for molecular flux.\n\nThe number of molecules flowing from chamber $1$ to $2$ per unit time, $J_1$, is $\\Phi_1 A$, and from $2$ to $1$, $J_2$, is $\\Phi_2 A$.\n$$J_1 = \\frac{1}{4} n_1 \\bar{c} A$$\n$$J_2 = \\frac{1}{4} n_2 \\bar{c} A$$\nThe mean speed $\\bar{c}$ is the same in both chambers because the temperature $T$ is uniform. The net flow rate of molecules from chamber $1$ to $2$ is $J_{net} = J_1 - J_2$.\n$$J_{net} = \\frac{dN}{dt} = \\frac{1}{4} \\bar{c} A (n_1 - n_2)$$\nThe throughput $Q$ is defined as the $pV$-flow rate. From the ideal gas law, $pV = N k_B T$. For a constant temperature process, the throughput is:\n$$Q = \\frac{d(pV)}{dt} = k_B T \\frac{dN}{dt} = k_B T J_{net}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $J_{net}$:\n$$Q = k_B T \\left[ \\frac{1}{4} \\bar{c} A (n_1 - n_2) \\right]$$\nUsing the ideal gas law again to relate number density $n$ to pressure $p$: $p = n k_B T$, so $n_1 = p_1/(k_B T)$ and $n_2 = p_2/(k_B T)$.\n$$Q = \\frac{1}{4} \\bar{c} A k_B T \\left(\\frac{p_1}{k_B T} - \\frac{p_2}{k_B T}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4} \\bar{c} A (p_1 - p_2)$$\nThe conductance $C$ is defined by the relation $Q = C(p_1 - p_2)$. By comparing this with our derived expression for $Q$, we identify the molecular-flow conductance as:\n$$C = \\frac{1}{4} \\bar{c} A$$\nThis completes the required derivations. The net throughput $Q$ is indeed related to the conductance $C$ and the pressure drop $(p_1-p_2)$ by $Q = C(p_1 - p_2)$.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nTo compute the throughput $Q$ for nitrogen ($\\text{N}_2$) at $T = 300\\ \\text{K}$, we first calculate the mean molecular speed $\\bar{c}$.\nThe mass of a single nitrogen molecule, $m$, is its molar mass $M_{\\text{N}_2}$ divided by Avogadro's constant $N_A$.\n$$M_{\\text{N}_2} = 28.0134\\ \\text{g}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1} = 0.0280134\\ \\text{kg}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$$\n$$m = \\frac{M_{\\text{N}_2}}{N_A} = \\frac{0.0280134\\ \\text{kg}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}}{6.022\\,140\\,76\\times 10^{23}\\ \\text{mol}^{-1}} \\approx 4.65173 \\times 10^{-26}\\ \\text{kg}$$\nNow, we calculate the mean speed $\\bar{c}$:\n$$\\bar{c} = \\sqrt{\\frac{8 k_B T}{\\pi m}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{8 (1.380\\,649\\times 10^{-23}\\ \\text{J}\\,\\text{K}^{-1})(300\\ \\text{K})}{\\pi (4.65173 \\times 10^{-26}\\ \\text{kg})}}$$\n$$\\bar{c} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{3.3135576 \\times 10^{-20}\\ \\text{J}}{1.46139 \\times 10^{-25}\\ \\text{kg}}} \\approx \\sqrt{226739.8\\ \\text{m}^2\\,\\text{s}^{-2}} \\approx 476.172\\ \\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$$\nWe can now calculate the throughput $Q$ using the given values:\n$A = 1.00\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\text{m}^2$\n$p_1 = 0.20\\ \\text{Pa}$\n$p_2 = 0.10\\ \\text{Pa}$\nThe pressure difference is $p_1 - p_2 = 0.20\\ \\text{Pa} - 0.10\\ \\text{Pa} = 0.10\\ \\text{Pa}$.\n$$Q = \\frac{1}{4} \\bar{c} A (p_1 - p_2)$$\n$$Q = \\frac{1}{4} (476.172\\ \\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}) (1.00\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\text{m}^2) (0.10\\ \\text{Pa})$$\n$$Q \\approx (119.043\\ \\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1}) \\times 10^{-4} \\times 0.10\\ \\text{Pa} \\approx 1.19043 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested:\n$$Q \\approx 1.190 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$$",

This is a classic Poiseuille flow setup.\n        *   The governing equation is a simplified Navier-Stokes equation: $\\mu \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 u}{\\mathrm{d} y^2} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}$. This is correct for steady, fully-developed, incompressible-like (low Mach number) flow in a channel.\n        *   The boundary conditions are first-order slip conditions, which are standard in rarefied gas dynamics. The problem description gives a qualitative description, but not the explicit formula. I need to recall the standard form of the Maxwell slip condition. The general form is $u_s = u_w - u_{gas}|_{wall} = \\pm \\ell_s \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial n}|_{wall}$, where $\\ell_s$ is the slip length and $n$ is the wall-normal coordinate pointing into the fluid. The slip length $\\ell_s$ is related to the mean free path $\\lambda$ and the TMAC $\\sigma_t$. The standard relationship is $\\ell_s = \\left(\\frac{2-\\sigma_t}{\\sigma_t}\\right) \\lambda$.\n        *   The Knudsen number is defined as $\\mathrm{Kn} = \\lambda/h$. This is a standard definition.\n        *   The problem asks to derive the velocity field, show the slip velocity's dependence on $\\sigma_t$, calculate the mass flow rate $Q$, and find the ratio $Q/Q_0$ (where $Q_0$ is the no-slip case).\n        *   A specific value for $\\mathrm{Kn}$ is given for the final calculation: $\\mathrm{Kn} = 0.5$.\n    *   **Step 3: Verdict**: The problem seems scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It's a standard problem in rarefied gas dynamics and microfluidics. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n2.  **Solve the Problem**:\n    *   **Step 2.1: State the full problem formulation**:\n        *   Governing Equation: $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 u}{\\mathrm{d} y^2} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x} = G$ (where $G$ is a constant).\n        *   Geometry: Channel from $y = -h$ to $y = +h$.\n        *   Boundary Conditions:\n            *   At the top wall ($y = +h$): The wall is stationary ($u_w = 0$). The outward normal from the fluid is in the $+y$ direction, so the inward normal $n$ is in the $-y$ direction. The slip velocity is $u_{slip} = u(y=h)$. The boundary condition is $u(y=h) = -\\ell_s \\left. \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}y} \\right|_{y=h}$. Let's be careful with the signs. The general form is $u_{gas}|_{wall} - u_{wall} = \\ell_s \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial n}|_{wall}$. Here, $u_{wall}=0$. At $y=+h$, the normal $n$ pointing into the gas is in the $-y$ direction. So $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n} = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}y}$. The condition becomes $u(h) = \\ell_s (-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}y}|_{y=h})$. So $u(h) = -\\ell_s \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}y}|_{h}$.\n            *   At the bottom wall ($y = -h$): The wall is stationary ($u_w = 0$). The normal $n$ pointing into the gas is in the $+y$ direction. So $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}y}$. The condition becomes $u(-h) = \\ell_s (\\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}y}|_{y=-h})$.\n            *   The slip length is $\\ell_s = \\left(\\frac{2-\\sigma_t}{\\sigma_t}\\right) \\lambda$.\n            *   Using the Knudsen number, $\\lambda = \\mathrm{Kn} \\cdot h$, so $\\ell_s = \\left(\\frac{2-\\sigma_t}{\\sigma_t}\\right) \\mathrm{Kn} \\cdot h$.\n\n    *   **Step 2.2: Integrate the governing equation**:\n        *   $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 u}{\\mathrm{d} y^2} = G$\n        *   Integrate once: $\\frac{\\mathrm{d} u}{\\mathrm{d} y} = Gy + C_1$.\n        *   Integrate again: $u(y) = \\frac{1}{2} G y^2 + C_1 y + C_2$.\n\n    *   **Step 2.3: Apply boundary conditions to find constants $C_1$ and $C_2$**:\n        *   The flow is symmetric about $y=0$. The velocity profile must be an even function of $y$, so $u(y) = u(-y)$. This implies that the term with $y$ must be zero, so $C_1 = 0$.\n        *   Let's verify this using the B.C.s.\n            *   $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}y}|_{y=h} = Gh + C_1$.\n            *   $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}y}|_{y=-h} = -Gh + C_1$.\n            *   $u(h) = \\frac{1}{2} G h^2 + C_1 h + C_2$.\n            *   $u(-h) = \\frac{1}{2} G h^2 - C_1 h + C_2$.\n            *   From the B.C. at $y=-h$: $u(-h) = \\ell_s \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}y}|_{-h}$.\n                $\\frac{1}{2} G h^2 - C_1 h + C_2 = \\ell_s (-Gh + C_1)$.\n            *   From the B.C. at $y=h$: $u(h) = -\\ell_s \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}y}|_{h}$.\n                $\\frac{1}{2} G h^2 + C_1 h + C_2 = -\\ell_s (Gh + C_1)$.\n            *   Subtracting the two equations: $2C_1 h = -\\ell_s(Gh+C_1) - \\ell_s(-Gh+C_1) = -\\ell_s Gh - \\ell_s C_1 + \\ell_s Gh - \\ell_s C_1 = -2 \\ell_s C_1$.\n            *   $2 C_1 h = -2 \\ell_s C_1 \\implies C_1(h + \\ell_s) = 0$. Since $h0$ and $\\ell_s \\ge 0$, this means $C_1=0$. This confirms the symmetry argument.\n        *   So, $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}y} = Gy$ and $u(y) = \\frac{1}{2} G y^2 + C_2$.\n        *   Now use one of the boundary conditions, e.g., at $y=h$:\n            *   $u(h) = -\\ell_s \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}y}|_{h}$.\n            *   $\\frac{1}{2} G h^2 + C_2 = -\\ell_s (Gh)$.\n            *   $C_2 = -\\frac{1}{2} G h^2 - \\ell_s G h$.\n        *   The velocity profile is:\n            $u(y) = \\frac{1}{2} G y^2 - \\frac{1}{2} G h^2 - \\ell_s G h = \\frac{G}{2} (y^2 - h^2) - G \\ell_s h$.\n            Since the pressure gradient $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}$ is negative for flow in the positive x-direction, $G = \\frac{1}{\\mu}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}$ is negative. Let's define $G' = -G = -\\frac{1}{\\mu}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}  0$.\n            $u(y) = \\frac{G' h^2}{2} \\left(1 - \\frac{y^2}{h^2}\\right) + G' \\ell_s h$.\n            This is the final velocity profile.\n\n    *   **Step 2.4: Analyze the slip velocity**:\n        *   The slip velocity is the velocity at the wall, $u_{slip} = u(y=h)$ (or $u(y=-h)$).\n        *   $u_{slip} = u(h) = \\frac{G' h^2}{2} \\left(1 - \\frac{h^2}{h^2}\\right) + G' \\ell_s h = G' \\ell_s h$.\n        *   The problem asks to show its dependence on $\\sigma_t$.\n        *   Substitute the expression for $\\ell_s$: $\\ell_s = \\left(\\frac{2-\\sigma_t}{\\sigma_t}\\right) \\lambda$.\n        *   So, $u_{slip} = G' h \\lambda \\left(\\frac{2-\\sigma_t}{\\sigma_t}\\right)$.\n        *   The slip velocity magnitude is directly proportional to the term $(\\frac{2-\\sigma_t}{\\sigma_t})$. As $\\sigma_t \\to 1$ (diffuse reflection), $u_{slip} \\to G' h \\lambda$. As $\\sigma_t \\to 0$ (specular reflection), $u_{slip} \\to \\infty$. This is a known artifact of the first-order slip model; higher-order models are needed for very small $\\sigma_t$. The problem states $\\sigma_t \\in (0, 1]$, so this is fine. The magnitude of slip velocity is inversely related to $\\sigma_t$.\n\n    *   **Step 2.5: Compute the mass flow rate Q**:\n        *   The mass flow rate per unit width (let's call it $W=1$) is given by $Q = \\int_{-h}^{h} \\rho u(y) \\, \\mathrm{d}y$.\n        *   The problem states the gas is dilute and compressibility effects are negligible. This means $\\rho$ is constant across the channel cross-section.\n        *   $Q = \\rho \\int_{-h}^{h} u(y) \\, \\mathrm{d}y$.\n        *   $Q = \\rho \\int_{-h}^{h} \\left[ \\frac{G' h^2}{2} \\left(1 - \\frac{y^2}{h^2}\\right) + G' \\ell_s h \\right] \\, \\mathrm{d}y$.\n        *   The integral is:\n            $\\int_{-h}^{h} \\left[ \\frac{G' h^2}{2} - \\frac{G' y^2}{2} + G' \\ell_s h \\right] \\, \\mathrm{d}y$\n            $= \\left[ \\frac{G' h^2}{2} y - \\frac{G' y^3}{6} + G' \\ell_s h y \\right]_{-h}^{h}$\n            $= \\left( \\frac{G' h^3}{2} - \\frac{G' h^3}{6} + G' \\ell_s h^2 \\right) - \\left( -\\frac{G' h^3}{2} + \\frac{G' h^3}{6} - G' \\ell_s h^2 \\right)$\n            $= 2 \\left( \\frac{G' h^3}{2} - \\frac{G' h^3}{6} + G' \\ell_s h^2 \\right)$\n            $= G' h^3 - \\frac{G' h^3}{3} + 2 G' \\ell_s h^2$\n            $= \\frac{2}{3} G' h^3 + 2 G' h^2 \\ell_s$.\n        *   So, $Q = \\rho G' \\left( \\frac{2}{3} h^3 + 2 h^2 \\ell_s \\right) = \\rho G' h^3 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{2 \\ell_s}{h} \\right)$.\n\n    *   **Step 2.6: Compute the no-slip mass flow rate $Q_0$**:\n        *   The no-slip condition corresponds to $\\ell_s = 0$.\n        *   Alternatively, it corresponds to $\\sigma_t \\to \\infty$ in some models, but in the Maxwell model it doesn't lead to no-slip. No-slip is a separate physical assumption, corresponding to $u(\\pm h) = 0$.\n        *   Let's re-derive for no-slip.\n            $u(y) = \\frac{1}{2} G y^2 + C_1 y + C_2$.\n            By symmetry $C_1=0$.\n            $u(h)=0 \\implies \\frac{1}{2} G h^2 + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2 = -\\frac{1}{2} G h^2$.\n            $u_0(y) = \\frac{1}{2} G (y^2 - h^2) = \\frac{G'}{2}(h^2 - y^2)$. This is the classic parabolic profile.\n        *   $Q_0 = \\rho \\int_{-h}^{h} u_0(y) \\, \\mathrm{d}y = \\rho \\int_{-h}^{h} \\frac{G'}{2}(h^2 - y^2) \\, \\mathrm{d}y$.\n        *   $\\int_{-h}^{h} (h^2 - y^2) \\, \\mathrm{d}y = [h^2 y - \\frac{y^3}{3}]_{-h}^h = (h^3 - \\frac{h^3}{3}) - (-h^3 + \\frac{h^3}{3}) = 2(h^3 - \\frac{h^3}{3}) = \\frac{4}{3}h^3$.\n        *   $Q_0 = \\rho \\frac{G'}{2} \\frac{4}{3} h^3 = \\frac{2}{3} \\rho G' h^3$.\n        *   This matches the first term in our expression for $Q$. This is consistent.\n\n    *   **Step 2.7: Form the ratio $Q/Q_0$ and substitute expressions**:\n        *   $\\frac{Q}{Q_0} = \\frac{\\rho G' h^3 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{2 \\ell_s}{h} \\right)}{\\frac{2}{3} \\rho G' h^3}$.\n        *   $\\frac{Q}{Q_0} = \\frac{\\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{2 \\ell_s}{h}}{\\frac{2}{3}} = 1 + \\frac{2 \\ell_s / h}{2/3} = 1 + \\frac{3 \\ell_s}{h}$.\n        *   Now substitute for $\\ell_s$: $\\ell_s = \\left(\\frac{2-\\sigma_t}{\\sigma_t}\\right) \\lambda$.\n        *   $\\frac{Q}{Q_0} = 1 + 3 \\frac{\\lambda}{h} \\left(\\frac{2-\\sigma_t}{\\sigma_t}\\right)$.\n        *   The problem defines $\\mathrm{Kn} = \\lambda/h$.\n        *   So, $\\frac{Q}{Q_0} = 1 + 3 \\, \\mathrm{Kn} \\left(\\frac{2-\\sigma_t}{\\sigma_t}\\right)$. This is a general expression.\n\n    *   **Step 2.8: Calculate the final result for the specific case**:\n        *   The problem asks for the result when $\\mathrm{Kn} = 0.5$.\n        *   Substitute $\\mathrm{Kn} = 0.5$ into the expression.\n        *   $\\frac{Q}{Q_0} = 1 + 3 (0.5) \\left(\\frac{2-\\sigma_t}{\\sigma_t}\\right)$.\n        *   $\\frac{Q}{Q_0} = 1 + 1.5 \\left(\\frac{2-\\sigma_t}{\\sigma_t}\\right)$.\n        *   Let's simplify this expression to a single fraction.\n        *   $\\frac{Q}{Q_0} = 1 + \\frac{1.5(2) - 1.5 \\sigma_t}{\\sigma_t} = 1 + \\frac{3 - 1.5 \\sigma_t}{\\sigma_t}$.\n        *   $\\frac{Q}{Q_0} = \\frac{\\sigma_t + 3 - 1.5 \\sigma_t}{\\sigma_t} = \\frac{3 - 0.5 \\sigma_t}{\\sigma_t}$.\n        *   Let's write the coefficients as fractions to be more formal. $0.5 = 1/2$, $1.5 = 3/2$.\n        *   $\\frac{Q}{Q_0} = 1 + \\frac{3}{2} \\left(\\frac{2-\\sigma_t}{\\sigma_t}\\right) = \\frac{2\\sigma_t + 3(2-\\sigma_t)}{2\\sigma_t} = \\frac{2\\sigma_t + 6 - 3\\sigma_t}{2\\sigma_t} = \\frac{6-\\sigma_t}{2\\sigma_t}$.\n        *   The solution has `(6 - sigma_t) / (2*sigma_t)`. My derivation is correct. I will approve this solution. The answer box format `\\boxed{ \\frac{6 - \\sigma_t}{2\\sigma_t} }` is also correct.",
