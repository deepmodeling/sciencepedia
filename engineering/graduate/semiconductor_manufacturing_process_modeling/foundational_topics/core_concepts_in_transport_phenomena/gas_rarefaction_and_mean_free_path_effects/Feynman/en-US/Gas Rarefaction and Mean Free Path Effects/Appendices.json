            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and self-contained. All provided parameters and physical constants are appropriate for the context of gas rarefaction in a cryogenic semiconductor processing environment. The physical models described, namely the Kinetic Theory of Gases (KTG), the ideal gas law, and its correction via the second virial coefficient for a van der Waals gas, are standard and correctly stated. The problem is therefore valid, and a solution may be constructed.\n\nThe problem requires two tasks: first, to derive the pressure dependence of the mean free path for an ideal gas, and second, to calculate the fractional error in this ideal-gas value compared to a more realistic non-ideal gas model.\n\nFirst, we address the derivation of the ideal-gas mean free path, $\\lambda_{\\text{ideal}}$. The mean free path $\\lambda$ is given by the KTG definition:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}\\,\\pi\\,d^{2}\\,n} $$\nwhere $d$ is the effective molecular diameter and $n$ is the number density of the gas molecules. For an ideal gas, the relationship between pressure $p$, number density $n$, and absolute temperature $T$ is given by the ideal gas law:\n$$ p = n\\,k_{B}\\,T $$\nwhere $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant. To find the pressure dependence of $\\lambda$, we first solve the ideal gas law for the number density $n$:\n$$ n_{\\text{ideal}} = \\frac{p}{k_{B}\\,T} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $n_{\\text{ideal}}$ into the KTG formula for $\\lambda$ yields the expression for the mean free path under the ideal gas assumption:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\text{ideal}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}\\,\\pi\\,d^{2}\\,\\left(\\frac{p}{k_{B}\\,T}\\right)} $$\nSimplifying this expression gives the explicit pressure dependence of the mean free path for an ideal gas:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\text{ideal}} = \\frac{k_{B}\\,T}{\\sqrt{2}\\,\\pi\\,d^{2}\\,p} $$\nThis expression shows that, for an ideal gas at constant temperature, the mean free path is inversely proportional to the pressure.\n\nNext, we calculate the fractional error $E$ incurred by using the ideal-gas expression for $\\lambda$ instead of the more accurate non-ideal, or real, expression. The fractional error is defined as:\n$$ E = \\left|\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{ideal}}-\\lambda_{\\text{real}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{real}}}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{ideal}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{real}}} - 1\\right| $$\nFrom the KTG definition, $\\lambda$ is inversely proportional to the number density $n$ ($\\lambda \\propto 1/n$). Therefore, the ratio of the mean free paths is the inverse of the ratio of the number densities:\n$$ \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{ideal}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{real}}} = \\frac{n_{\\text{real}}}{n_{\\text{ideal}}} $$\nFor the real gas, the pressure is described by the compressibility factor $Z$:\n$$ p = n_{\\text{real}}\\,k_{B}\\,T\\,Z $$\nfrom which we find the real gas number density:\n$$ n_{\\text{real}} = \\frac{p}{k_{B}\\,T\\,Z} $$\nThe ratio of the number densities is then:\n$$ \\frac{n_{\\text{real}}}{n_{\\text{ideal}}} = \\frac{p/(k_{B}\\,T\\,Z)}{p/(k_{B}\\,T)} = \\frac{1}{Z} $$\nThus, the fractional error $E$ can be expressed in terms of the compressibility factor $Z$:\n$$ E = \\left|\\frac{1}{Z} - 1\\right| = \\left|\\frac{1-Z}{Z}\\right| $$\nThe problem provides a low-density approximation for $Z$ based on the second virial coefficient, $B(T)$:\n$$ Z \\approx 1 + B(T)\\,\\frac{p}{R\\,T} $$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant.

The assumptions are standard and appropriate for deriving the fundamental physics of molecular flow through an orifice.\n\n### Derivation\nIn the free-molecular flow regime, gas molecules move independently. The net gas transport through the orifice is the difference between the one-way flows from chamber 1 to 2 and from chamber 2 to 1. The rate of molecules crossing an area from one side is given by the molecular impingement rate, or flux ($\\Phi$), which is the number of molecules striking a surface per unit area per unit time.\n\nFrom kinetic theory, the flux $\\Phi$ for a gas in thermal equilibrium is given by the Hertz-Knudsen equation:\n$$ \\Phi = \\frac{1}{4} n \\bar{c} $$\nwhere $n$ is the number density of the gas and $\\bar{c}$ is the mean molecular speed, given by $\\bar{c} = \\sqrt{\\frac{8k_B T}{\\pi m}}$.\n\nThe total number of molecules flowing from chamber 1 to 2 per second ($J_{1\\to2}$) is the flux from chamber 1 multiplied by the orifice area $A$:\n$$ J_{1\\to2} = \\Phi_1 A = \\frac{1}{4} n_1 \\bar{c} A $$\nSimilarly, the flow from chamber 2 to 1 is:\n$$ J_{2\\to1} = \\Phi_2 A = \\frac{1}{4} n_2 \\bar{c} A $$\nThe mean speed $\\bar{c}$ is the same in both chambers as the temperature $T$ is uniform.\n\nThe net flow rate of molecules from chamber 1 to 2 is $J_{net} = J_{1\\to2} - J_{2\\to1}$:\n$$ J_{net} = \\frac{dN}{dt} = \\frac{1}{4} \\bar{c} A (n_1 - n_2) $$\nThe throughput $Q$ is defined as the $pV$-flow rate. From the ideal gas law, $pV = N k_B T$. At constant temperature, the throughput is:\n$$ Q = \\frac{d(pV)}{dt} = k_B T \\frac{dN}{dt} = k_B T J_{net} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $J_{net}$:\n$$ Q = k_B T \\left[ \\frac{1}{4} \\bar{c} A (n_1 - n_2) \\right] $$\nUsing the ideal gas law again to relate number density $n$ to pressure $p$ ($p = n k_B T$), we can write $n_1 = p_1/(k_B T)$ and $n_2 = p_2/(k_B T)$.\n$$ Q = \\frac{1}{4} \\bar{c} A k_B T \\left(\\frac{p_1}{k_B T} - \\frac{p_2}{k_B T}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4} \\bar{c} A (p_1 - p_2) $$\nBy definition, conductance $C$ relates throughput to the pressure difference via $Q = C(p_1 - p_2)$.
