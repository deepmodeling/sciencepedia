            "problem": "A planar silicon wafer is undergoing low-pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) of a binary hydride precursor in a horizontal reactor. The precursor is dilute in a carrier gas and is the rate-limiting species for deposition. Consider a steady laminar flow over the wafer such that the normal (wall-normal) convective velocity is negligible across a thin concentration boundary layer adjacent to the surface. The gas phase has no homogeneous reaction and exhibits constant properties. Model the boundary layer as a stagnant film of thickness $\\delta$ in which diffusion of the precursor with constant binary diffusivity $D$ delivers species from the bulk to the surface. At the surface, the precursor is consumed by a first-order heterogeneous reaction with an intrinsic rate constant $k_{s}$, so that the molar surface reaction rate density equals $k_{s} c_{s}$, where $c_{s}$ is the precursor molar concentration at the surface. Far from the surface, the precursor molar concentration is uniform and equal to $c_{\\infty}$.\n\nStarting from steady-state species conservation in the film and Fick’s first law, with appropriate boundary conditions at the wall and at the edge of the film, derive a closed-form expression for the steady molar deposition flux $J$ to the wafer surface and rewrite it in a form that can be interpreted as a sum of an interfacial kinetic resistance and an external mass-transfer resistance.

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically sound, well-posed, and self-contained. The physical model proposed—a stagnant film with first-order surface kinetics—is a standard and appropriate simplification for analyzing mass transfer in a CVD process. All necessary data are provided, and the parameters have physically reasonable values.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the steady molar deposition flux, $J$, onto a wafer surface. We model the system as one-dimensional transport across a stagnant film of thickness $\\delta$. Let the coordinate $y$ be normal to the wafer surface, with $y=0$ at the surface and $y=\\delta$ at the edge of the film.\n\nThe steady-state species conservation for the precursor in the film, with no homogeneous reactions, is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{dJ_y}{dy} = 0\n$$\nwhere $J_y$ is the molar flux of the precursor in the $y$-direction. This implies that $J_y$ is constant throughout the film. According to Fick's first law for a dilute species, the flux is related to the concentration gradient:\n$$\nJ_y = -D \\frac{dc}{dy}\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the constant binary diffusivity and $c(y)$ is the molar concentration of the precursor. Combining these two equations, since $D$ is constant, we obtain the governing second-order ordinary differential equation for the concentration profile:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2c}{dy^2} = 0\n$$\nThe general solution to this equation is a linear concentration profile:\n$$\nc(y) = C_1 y + C_2\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants of integration to be determined from the boundary conditions.\n\nThe boundary conditions are as follows:\n1.  At the edge of the stagnant film ($y=\\delta$), the precursor concentration is equal to the bulk gas concentration, $c_{\\infty}$.\n    $$\n    c(\\delta) = c_{\\infty}\n    $$\n2.  At the wafer surface ($y=0$), the diffusive flux of the precursor towards the surface must equal the rate at which it is consumed by the first-order surface reaction. The deposition flux, $J$, is defined as this rate. The rate of arrival by diffusion (flux in the $-y$ direction) is $-J_y = D \\frac{dc}{dy}$. The rate of consumption is $k_s c_s$, where $c_s = c(0)$.\n    $$\n    J = \\left.

Substituting the expression for $C_1$:\n$$\nJ = D \\left( \\frac{c_{\\infty}}{\\delta + \\frac{D}{k_s}} \\right) = \\frac{D c_{\\infty}}{\\delta + \\frac{D}{k_s}}\n$$\nTo rewrite this in the form of a sum of resistances, we can rearrange the expression as:\n$$\nJ = \\frac{c_{\\infty}}{\\frac{\\delta}{D} + \\frac{1}{k_s}}\n$$\nThis expression is analogous to Ohm's law ($I = V/R$), where the flux $J$ is the \"current,\" the bulk concentration $c_{\\infty}$ serves as the driving potential, and the denominator is the total resistance to mass transfer, $R_{total}$. The total resistance is the sum of two series resistances:\n1.  An external mass-transfer resistance, $R_{mt} = \\frac{\\delta}{D}$, which characterizes the opposition to diffusion through the stagnant film.\n2.  An interfacial kinetic resistance, $R_{kin} = \\frac{1}{k_s}$, which characterizes the opposition to the chemical reaction at the surface.\n\nThus, the expression is $J = \\frac{c_{\\infty}}{R_{mt} + R_{kin}}$.\nThis summed-resistances model, derived from the stagnant film approximation, has notable limitations compared to a full convective boundary-layer solution. The stagnant film model assumes a fictitious, motionless layer of a fixed thickness $\\delta$. In reality, the fluid velocity is non-zero within the boundary layer and varies with position. A full solution of the coupled fluid dynamics (Navier-Stokes equations) and mass transport (convective-diffusion equation) would show that the boundary layer thickness grows with distance from the wafer's leading edge. Consequently, the actual deposition flux $J$ is not uniform across the wafer surface, being highest at the leading edge and decreasing downstream. The stagnant film model, using a single effective $\\delta$, provides only a spatially-averaged or localized estimate of the flux and cannot capture these two-dimensional effects.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of the flux $J$ using the given parameters:\n-   $c_{\\infty} = 2.40 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n-   $D = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n-   $\\delta = 5.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{m}$\n-   $k_{s} = 0.20 \\ \\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the individual resistances:\nThe mass-transfer resistance is:\n$$\nR_{mt} = \\frac{\\delta}{D} = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{m}}{5.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 10.0 \\ \\mathrm{s}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\n$$\nThe kinetic resistance is:\n$$\nR_{kin} = \\frac{1}{k_s} = \\frac{1}{0.20 \\ \\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 5.0 \\ \\mathrm{s}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\n$$\nThe total resistance is the sum of these two values:\n$$\nR_{total} = R_{mt} + R_{kin} = 10.0 \\ \\mathrm{s}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1} + 5.0 \\ \\mathrm{s}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1} = 15.0 \\ \\mathrm{s}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the deposition flux $J$:\n$$\nJ = \\frac{c_{\\infty}}{R_{total}} = \\frac{2.40 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}}{15.0 \\ \\mathrm{s}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}} = 0.00016 \\ \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThis can be written in scientific notation as $1.6 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nJ = 1.600 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$",

For a constant diffusivity $D$, the partial differential equation (PDE) for the concentration $c(y,t)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial y^2} \\quad \\text{for } y \\in (0, \\delta_c), t > 0 $$\n\nThe boundary and initial conditions are formulated as follows:\n\n1.  **Boundary Condition at the wafer surface ($y=0$):** At the surface, the diffusive flux of the reactant towards the wafer must be equal to the rate of consumption by the first-order surface reaction. The diffusive flux in the positive $y$-direction is given by $J_y = -D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial y}$. The rate of arrival of reactant at the surface per unit area is the magnitude of this flux, $|J_y(0,t)|$. Since concentration is expected to decrease towards the surface, $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial y} > 0$, making $J_y < 0$. Thus, the rate of arrival is $-J_y(0,t) = D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial y}\\Big|_{y=0}$. The consumption rate per unit area is given as $k_s c(0,t)$. Equating these gives the boundary condition:\n    $$ D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial y}\\Big|_{y=0} = k_s c(0, t), \\quad t > 0 $$\n\n2.  **Boundary Condition at the outer edge of the boundary layer ($y=\\delta_c$):** The concentration at the outer edge is instantaneously changed to $c_\\infty$ at $t=0$ and held constant.\n    $$ c(\\delta_c, t) = c_\\infty, \\quad t > 0 $$\n\n3.  **Initial Condition ($t=0$):** Before the change, the concentration in the boundary layer was uniform at $c_0$.

At $y=\\delta_c$: $c_{\\mathrm{ss}}(\\delta_c) = c_\\infty$.\n    Substituting $c_{\\mathrm{ss}}(y)$ gives $A\\delta_c + B = c_\\infty$.\n\nWe now solve the system of two linear equations for $A$ and $B$:\nFrom the first condition, $A = \\frac{k_s}{D} B$.\nSubstituting this into the second condition:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{k_s}{D} B\\right) \\delta_c + B = c_\\infty $$\n$$ B \\left(1 + \\frac{k_s \\delta_c}{D}\\right) = c_\\infty $$\nThe constant $B$ is the steady-state surface concentration, $c_{s,\\mathrm{ss}} = c_{\\mathrm{ss}}(0)$.\n$$ c_{s,\\mathrm{ss}} = B = \\frac{c_\\infty}{1 + \\frac{k_s \\delta_c}{D}} $$\nThe constant $A$ is then:\n$$ A = \\frac{k_s}{D} c_{s,\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{k_s}{D} \\frac{c_\\infty}{1 + \\frac{k_s \\delta_c}{D}} = \\frac{k_s c_\\infty}{D + k_s \\delta_c} $$\nThe steady-state concentration profile is therefore:\n$$ c_{\\mathrm{ss}}(y) = \\left(\\frac{k_s c_\\infty}{D + k_s \\delta_c}\\right) y + \\frac{D c_\\infty}{D + k_s \\delta_c} = c_\\infty \\frac{1 + (k_s/D)y}{1 + (k_s/D)\\delta_c} $$\n\n### Part 3: Transient Solution and Single-Mode Approximation\n\nTo solve the transient problem, we define a deviation variable $u(y,t)$ from the steady state:\n$$ u(y,t) = c(y,t) - c_{\\mathrm{ss}}(y) $$\nThe governing equation and boundary conditions for $u(y,t)$ become homogeneous.\nThe PDE for $u(y,t)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} - \\frac{\\partial c_{\\mathrm{ss}}}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial y^2} - 0 = D \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{d^2 c_{\\mathrm{ss}}}{d y^2} \\right) = D \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} $$\nThe boundary conditions for $u(y,t)$ are:\nAt $y=0$: $D \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\Big|_{y=0} - k_s u(0,t) = D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial y}\\Big|_{y=0} - D \\frac{d c_{\\mathrm{ss}}}{dy}\\Big|_{y=0} - [k_s c(0,t) - k_s c_{\\mathrm{ss}}(0)] = 0$, leading to $D \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\Big|_{y=0} = k_s u(0,t)$.\nAt $y=\\delta_c$: $u(\\delta_c, t) = c(\\delta_c, t) - c_{\\mathrm{ss}}(\\delta_c) = c_\\infty - c_\\infty = 0$.\nThe initial condition is:\n$$ u(y,0) = c(y,0) - c_{\\mathrm{ss}}(y) = c_0 - c_{\\mathrm{ss}}(y) $$\nWe use separation of variables, letting $u(y,t) = Y(y)T(t)$. This leads to the standard Sturm-Liouville problem for the spatial part $Y(y)$:\n$$ Y''(y) + \\lambda^2 Y(y) = 0 $$\n$$ D Y'(0) = k_s Y(0) $$\n$$ Y(\\delta_c) = 0 $$\nThe general solution for $Y(y)$ is $Y(y) = C_1 \\cos(\\lambda y) + C_2 \\sin(\\lambda y)$.\nApplying the boundary condition at $y=0$: $D(C_2\\lambda) = k_s(C_1)$, so $C_2 = \\frac{k_s}{D\\lambda}C_1$.\nThe solution becomes $Y(y) = C_1 (\\cos(\\lambda y) + \\frac{k_s}{D\\lambda}\\sin(\\lambda y))$.\nApplying the boundary condition at $y=\\delta_c$:\n$$ \\cos(\\lambda \\delta_c) + \\frac{k_s}{D\\lambda}\\sin(\\lambda \\delta_c) = 0 $$\n$$ \\cot(\\lambda\\delta_c) = -\\frac{k_s}{D\\lambda} $$\nLet $\\beta_n = \\lambda_n \\delta_c$ be the dimensionless eigenvalues (mode wavenumbers). Let $Bi = \\frac{k_s \\delta_c}{D}$ be the Biot number for mass transfer (also known as a Damköhler number). The eigenvalue condition is:\n$$ \\beta_n \\cot(\\beta_n) = -Bi $$\nThe time-dependent part is $T(t) = \\exp(-D\\lambda_n^2 t) = \\exp(-D(\\beta_n/\\delta_c)^2 t)$.\nThe full solution is $u(y,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty A_n Y_n(y) \\exp(-D\\beta_n^2 t / \\delta_c^2)$.\n\nFor long times, the transient behavior is dominated by the first mode (smallest positive eigenvalue $\\beta_1$), which has the slowest decay rate. The leading-order single-exponential approximation for the surface concentration $c_s(t) = c(0,t) = u(0,t) + c_{s,\\mathrm{ss}}$ is:\n$$ c_s(t) \\approx c_{s,\\mathrm{ss}} + A_1 Y_1(0) \\exp(-D\\beta_1^2 t / \\delta_c^2) $$\nSince $Y_1(0)=C_1$, we can absorb $C_1$ into the coefficient $A_1$. The coefficient for the simplified approximation can be found from the initial condition:\n$c_s(0) = c_0 \\approx c_{s,\\mathrm{ss}} + A_1'$, so $A_1' \\approx c_0 - c_{s,\\mathrm{ss}}$.\nThe approximation is:\n$$ c_s(t) \\approx c_{s,\\mathrm{ss}} + (c_0 - c_{s,\\mathrm{ss}}) \\exp(-t/\\tau) $$\nThe characteristic response time scale is $\\tau = \\frac{\\delta_c^2}{D \\beta_1^2}$. This time scale depends on $\\delta_c^2$ and $D^{-1}$ directly, but also indirectly through the eigenvalue $\\beta_1$, which is a function of the Biot number $Bi = k_s \\delta_c / D$.\n\n### Part 4: Numerical Calculation\n\nWe are given the parameters:\n$D = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}$\n$\\delta_c = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{m}$\n$k_s = 0.20 \\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$\n$c_0 = 0 \\ \\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-3}}$\n$c_\\infty = 2.0 \\times 10^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-3}}$\n\nFirst, calculate the Biot number:\n$$ Bi = \\frac{k_s \\delta_c}{D} = \\frac{(0.20 \\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}})(1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{m})}{1.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}} = 20 $$\nNext, find the first positive root $\\beta_1$ of the eigenvalue equation $\\beta \\cot(\\beta) = -20$, which can be rewritten as $\\tan(\\beta) = -\\frac{\\beta}{20}$. The first positive root lies in the interval $(\\pi/2, \\pi)$. A numerical solution yields:\n$$ \\beta_1 \\approx 2.99275 $$\nNow, calculate the characteristic time scale $\\tau$:\n$$ \\tau = \\frac{\\delta_c^2}{D \\beta_1^2} = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{m})^2}{(1.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}) (2.99275)^2} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-6}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\times 8.95655} \\ \\mathrm{s} \\approx 0.0111649 \\ \\mathrm{s} $$\nThe single-mode approximation for the surface concentration, with $c_0=0$, is:\n$$ c_s(t) \\approx c_{s,\\mathrm{ss}}(1 - \\exp(-t/\\tau)) $$\nWe need to find the time $t_{0.9}$ when the surface concentration reaches $0.9$ of its steady-state value, i.e., $c_s(t_{0.9}) = 0.9 c_{s,\\mathrm{ss}}$.\n$$ 0.9 c_{s,\\mathrm{ss}} = c_{s,\\mathrm{ss}}(1 - \\exp(-t_{0.9}/\\tau)) $$\n$$ 0.9 = 1 - \\exp(-t_{0.9}/\\tau) $$\n$$ \\exp(-t_{0.9}/\\tau) = 0.1 $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ -\\frac{t_{0.9}}{\\tau} = \\ln(0.1) = -\\ln(10) $$\n$$ t_{0.9} = \\tau \\ln(10) $$\nSubstituting the value of $\\tau$:\n$$ t_{0.9} = (0.0111649 \\ \\mathrm{s}) \\times \\ln(10) \\approx 0.0111649 \\times 2.302585 \\ \\mathrm{s} \\approx 0.0257036 \\ \\mathrm{s} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the time required is $0.02570 \\ \\mathrm{s}$.",
