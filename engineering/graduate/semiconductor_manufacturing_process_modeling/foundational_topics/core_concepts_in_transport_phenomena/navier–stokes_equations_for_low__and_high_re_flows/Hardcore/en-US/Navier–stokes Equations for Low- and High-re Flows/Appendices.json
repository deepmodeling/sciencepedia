The physical parameters provided are realistic for such a process. This is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem clearly defines the physical system and provides all necessary parameters to perform a standard scaling analysis and calculate the required nondimensional numbers. The questions are specific and lead to a unique set of answers.\n3.  **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, technical language, free of any subjective or opinion-based content.\n4.  **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup:** The problem is self-contained and provides a consistent set of data. The wafer diameter of $300 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$ is consistent with the given radius of $R = 0.150 \\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n5.  **Unrealistic or Infeasible:** The physical conditions and material properties are plausible for a CMP slurry and process.\n6.  All other criteria for validity are met. The problem is a standard exercise in fluid mechanics scaling.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires a scaling analysis of the flow of a slurry in a thin gap, which is governed by the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations for momentum and continuity:\n$$ \\rho \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} \\right) = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{f}_b $$\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0 $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity vector, $p$ is the pressure, $\\rho$ is the density, $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, and $\\mathbf{f}_b$ is the body force per unit volume.\n\n1.  **Characteristic Scales ($U$ and $L$)**\n    For a thin-film flow where the thickness $h$ is much smaller than the lateral extent $R$ (i.e., $h \\ll R$), the dominant velocity gradients occur across the thin gap. Therefore, the natural characteristic length scale is the film thickness.\n    $L = h$\n    The motion is driven by the rotation of the pad, which shears the fluid. The characteristic velocity of the system is determined by the speed of the moving boundary. The maximum velocity occurs at the outer edge of the wafer, $r=R$. The tangential velocity at this point defines the characteristic velocity scale $U$.\n    $U = \\Omega_p R$\n    The choice of these scales is justified by considering the dominant terms in the Navier-Stokes equations. In a thin shear layer, the viscous stress is dominated by gradients normal to the surface, scaling as $\\mu U/L^2 = \\mu (\\Omega_p R) / h^2$. The inertial forces scale as $\\rho U^2/R = \\rho (\\Omega_p R)^2/R$. The physics is captured by balancing these dominant effects. The length scale $L=h$ is associated with the largest gradients, and the velocity scale $U=\\Omega_p R$ is the primary driver of the flow.\n\n    To compute the numerical value of $U$, we first convert the rotational speed $\\Omega_p$ to SI units (radians per second):\n    $$ \\Omega_p = 60 \\,\\mathrm{rpm} = 60 \\,\\frac{\\mathrm{rev}}{\\mathrm{min}} \\times \\frac{2\\pi \\,\\mathrm{rad}}{1 \\,\\mathrm{rev}} \\times \\frac{1 \\,\\mathrm{min}}{60 \\,\\mathrm{s}} = 2\\pi \\,\\mathrm{rad\\,s^{-1}} $$\n    Now, we compute $U$:\n    $$ U = \\Omega_p R = (2\\pi \\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}) \\times (0.150 \\,\\mathrm{m}) = 0.3\\pi \\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}} \\approx 0.942477... \\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}} $$\n    The characteristic length is given:\n    $$ L = h = 7.5 \\times 10^{-5} \\,\\mathrm{m} $$\n    Rounding to three significant figures as requested for the final answer compilation, $U \\approx 0.942 \\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$.\n\n2.  **Reynolds Number ($\\mathrm{Re}$)**\n    The Reynolds number represents the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces. Using the characteristic scales identified:\n    $$ \\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{\\text{Inertial Force}}{\\text{Viscous Force}} \\sim \\frac{\\rho U^2 / R}{\\mu U / h^2} = \\frac{\\rho U h^2}{\\mu R} $$\n    However, the standard definition of the Reynolds number for shear flows uses the gap height as the characteristic length, i.e., $\\mathrm{Re} = \\rho U L / \\mu$.\n    $$ \\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{\\rho U L}{\\mu} = \\frac{\\rho (\\Omega_p R) h}{\\mu} $$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$ \\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{(1200 \\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}) \\times (0.3\\pi \\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}) \\times (7.5 \\times 10^{-5} \\,\\mathrm{m})}{6.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{Pa\\,s}} $$\n    $$ \\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{1200 \\times 0.3\\pi \\times 7.5 \\times 10^{-5}}{6.0 \\times 10^{-3}} = 4.5\\pi \\approx 14.137... $$\n    To three significant figures, $\\mathrm{Re} \\approx 14.1$. This low-to-moderate value suggests that while viscous forces are significant, inertial effects cannot be completely neglected.\n\n3.  **Gravity vs. Viscous Force Ratio ($S$)**\n    This nondimensional number $S$ compares the magnitude of the body force due to gravity to the viscous stress. The body force per unit volume is $\\mathbf{f}_b = \\rho \\mathbf{g}$, with magnitude $\\rho g$. The characteristic viscous force per unit volume from the term $\\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$ scales as $\\mu U/L^2$.\n    $$ S = \\frac{\\text{Body Force}}{\\text{Viscous Force}} = \\frac{\\rho g}{\\mu U / L^2} = \\frac{\\rho g L^2}{\\mu U} $$\n    Substituting the characteristic scales $L=h$ and $U=\\Omega_p R$:\n    $$ S = \\frac{\\rho g h^2}{\\mu (\\Omega_p R)} $$\n    Substituting the numerical values:\n    $$ S = \\frac{(1200 \\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}) \\times (9.81 \\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}) \\times (7.5 \\times 10^{-5} \\,\\mathrm{m})^2}{(6.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{Pa\\,s}) \\times (0.3\\pi \\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}})} $$\n    $$ S = \\frac{1200 \\times 9.81 \\times 5.625 \\times 10^{-9}}{6.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\times 0.3\\pi} = \\frac{6.62175 \\times 10^{-5}}{0.0056548...} \\approx 0.01171... $$\n    To three significant figures, $S \\approx 1.17 \\times 10^{-2}$. The small value of $S$ indicates that gravitational forces are negligible compared to the dominant viscous shear forces, a typical feature of such microscale flows.\n\n4.  **Mach Number ($M$)**\n    The Mach number assesses the importance of fluid compressibility by comparing the characteristic flow speed to the speed of sound in the fluid.\n    $$ M = \\frac{U}{c} $$\n    Substituting the characteristic scales $U=\\Omega_p R$:\n    $$ M = \\frac{\\Omega_p R}{c} $$\n    Substituting the numerical values:\n    $$ M = \\frac{0.3\\pi \\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}}{1500 \\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}} = \\frac{\\pi}{5000} \\approx 6.2831... \\times 10^{-4} $$\n    To three significant figures, $M \\approx 6.28 \\times 10^{-4}$. Since $M \\ll 1$ (specifically, $M  0.3$), the flow can be considered effectively incompressible, which validates the use of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations as stated in the problem.\n\nThe computed numerical values, rounded to three significant figures, are:\n- $U \\approx 0.942 \\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$\n- $L = 7.50 \\times 10^{-5} \\,\\mathrm{m}$ (representing the given $7.5 \\times 10^{-5} \\,\\mathrm{m}$ to three significant figures for consistency)\n- $\\mathrm{Re} \\approx 14.1$\n- $S \\approx 1.17 \\times 10^{-2}$\n- $M \\approx 6.28 \\times 10^{-4}$\nThese values will be presented in a row matrix in the final answer.",

The context of CVD in semiconductor manufacturing is appropriate. The assumptions provided (steady, incompressible, axisymmetric, narrow gap) are standard and self-consistent for simplifying the Navier-Stokes equations. The problem is objective and well-defined.\n\nA potential ambiguity exists in the description of the contour $\\mathcal{C}$: \"circular contour $\\mathcal{C}$ of radius $R$ located at the mid-gap $y=g/2$\". The mid-gap position $y=g/2$ corresponds to a physical radius of $r = R+g/2$ (assuming the gap is oriented radially outward), which is not equal to $R$. This apparent contradiction can be resolved by interpreting the statement within the context of the requested small-gap approximation ($g \\ll R$), where the radii of all circular paths within the gap are approximated to leading order as $R$. This is a consistent application of the approximation scheme. Therefore, the problem is not considered ill-posed or contradictory, but rather requires a careful and consistent application of the stated approximation.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe Navier–Stokes equations represent Newton's second law for a fluid element, balancing the rate of change of momentum with the sum of surface forces (pressure and viscous) and body forces. For an incompressible Newtonian fluid with constant properties, the momentum equation in cylindrical coordinates $(r, \\theta, z)$ is:\n$$\n\\rho \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} \\right) = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}\n$$\nWe are interested in the azimuthal ($\\theta$) component of this equation. The velocity vector is $\\mathbf{u} = u_r \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_r + u_\\theta \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_\\theta + u_z \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_z$. The $\\theta$-component of the momentum equation is:\n$$\n\\rho \\left( \\frac{\\partial u_\\theta}{\\partial t} + u_r \\frac{\\partial u_\\theta}{\\partial r} + \\frac{u_\\theta}{r} \\frac{\\partial u_\\theta}{\\partial \\theta} + u_z \\frac{\\partial u_\\theta}{\\partial z} + \\frac{u_r u_\\theta}{r} \\right) = -\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial \\theta} + \\mu \\left[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r u_\\theta)\\right) + \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 u_\\theta}{\\partial \\theta^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u_\\theta}{\\partial z^2} \\right]\n$$\nWe apply the given assumptions to simplify this equation for the flow in the narrow gap:\n- Steady flow: $\\frac{\\partial u_\\theta}{\\partial t} = 0$.\n- Negligible radial and axial flow: $u_r \\approx 0$ and $u_z \\approx 0$.\n- Axisymmetry: All derivatives with respect to $\\theta$ are zero, so $\\frac{\\partial u_\\theta}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial^2 u_\\theta}{\\partial \\theta^2} = 0$.\n- No imposed azimuthal pressure gradient: $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$.\n\nApplying these assumptions, the entire left-hand side (inertial terms) becomes zero. The equation reduces to:\n$$\n0 = \\mu \\left[ \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}(r u_\\theta)\\right) + \\frac{d^2 u_\\theta}{dz^2} \\right]\n$$\nThe problem describes an annular gap at the rim. This can be modeled as either two concentric cylinders (gap in the $r$-direction) or two parallel disks (gap in the $z$-direction). In either case, for a narrow gap $g \\ll R$, the curvature can be neglected, and the flow can be treated locally as a planar Couette flow. The problem provides a single coordinate $y$ across the gap. The governing equation simplifies significantly. For instance, if the gap is radial, we let $r = R+y$ and $dr=dy$. Since $y \\ll R$, we have $r \\approx R$. The dominant viscous term is the one with the highest derivative across the narrowest dimension, which is $y$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 u_\\theta}{dy^2} = 0\n$$\nThis is the governing equation for planar Couette flow, which is the leading-order model for the velocity profile in a narrow gap, valid when inertia is negligible compared to viscosity (a low-gap-Reynolds-number flow).\n\nWe solve this second-order ordinary differential equation by integrating twice with respect to $y$:\n$$\n\\frac{d u_\\theta}{dy} = C_1\n$$\n$$\nu_\\theta(y) = C_1 y + C_2\n$$\nThe constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ are determined from the boundary conditions. The coordinate $y=0$ is at the rotating rim, which moves at the tangential speed $U = \\Omega R$. The coordinate $y=g$ is at the stationary shroud.\n- Boundary condition at $y=0$: $u_\\theta(0) = U = \\Omega R$.\n- Boundary condition at $y=g$: $u_\\theta(g) = 0$.\n\nApplying the first condition:\n$u_\\theta(0) = C_1(0) + C_2 = U \\implies C_2 = U$.\n\nApplying the second condition:\n$u_\\theta(g) = C_1 g + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_1 g + U = 0 \\implies C_1 = -\\frac{U}{g}$.\n\nSubstituting the constants back into the general solution gives the leading-order azimuthal velocity profile:\n$$\nu_\\theta(y) = -\\frac{U}{g} y + U = U \\left(1 - \\frac{y}{g}\\right)\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the circulation $\\Gamma = \\oint_{\\mathcal{C}} \\mathbf{u}\\cdot d\\mathbf{l}$.\nThe contour $\\mathcal{C}$ is a circle \"of radius $R$\" at the mid-gap position $y = g/2$.\nThe velocity vector is purely azimuthal, $\\mathbf{u} = u_\\theta(y) \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_\\theta$. The line element for a circular path of radius $r$ is $d\\mathbf{l} = r \\, d\\theta \\, \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_\\theta$.\nThe circulation is:\n$$\n\\Gamma = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} (u_\\theta(y) \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_\\theta) \\cdot (r \\, d\\theta \\, \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_\\theta) = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} u_\\theta(y) r \\, d\\theta\n$$\nFor the contour $\\mathcal{C}$, the velocity is evaluated at the mid-gap, $y = g/2$:\n$$\nu_{\\theta,\\text{mid}} = u_\\theta(g/2) = U \\left(1 - \\frac{g/2}{g}\\right) = U \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{U}{2}\n$$\nThe radius of the contour requires careful interpretation. The contour is at the physical radius $r=R+g/2$. However, the problem specifies \"radius $R$\" and is framed within the small-gap approximation ($g \\ll R$). In this approximation, it is consistent to use the leading-order radius, $R$, for the path length calculation. This resolves the seeming contradiction in the problem statement. Thus, the circumference of $\\mathcal{C}$ is taken as $2\\pi R$.\nSince the velocity and radius are constant along $\\mathcal{C}$, the integral simplifies:\n$$\n\\Gamma = u_{\\theta,\\text{mid}} \\cdot (\\text{circumference of } \\mathcal{C}) = \\left(\\frac{U}{2}\\right) (2\\pi R) = \\pi R U\n$$\nSubstitute the definition $U = \\Omega R$:\n$$\n\\Gamma = \\pi R (\\Omega R) = \\pi \\Omega R^2\n$$\nFinally, we relate this result to the given Reynolds number, $\\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{\\rho \\Omega R^2}{\\mu}$.\nFrom this definition, we can express the term $\\Omega R^2$ as:\n$$\n\\Omega R^2 = \\mathrm{Re} \\cdot \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho}\n$$\nThe problem also defines the kinematic viscosity as $\\nu = \\mu/\\rho$. Substituting this, we get:\n$$\n\\Omega R^2 = \\mathrm{Re} \\cdot \\nu\n$$\nSubstituting this into our expression for the circulation $\\Gamma$:\n$$\n\\Gamma = \\pi (\\mathrm{Re} \\cdot \\nu) = \\pi \\nu \\mathrm{Re}\n$$\nThis expression shows that, to leading order, the circulation around the mid-gap contour scales linearly with the Reynolds number $\\mathrm{Re}$ defined on the global scales $R$ and $U$.",

In a Cartesian coordinate system with $x$ aligned with the flow direction and $y$ normal to the plate, these are:\n\nContinuity:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = 0 $$\n\n$x$-momentum:\n$$ u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} + \\nu \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} \\right) $$\n\n$y$-momentum:\n$$ u \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y} + \\nu \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial y^2} \\right) $$\n\nHere, $u$ and $v$ are the velocity components in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively, $p$ is the pressure, $\\rho$ is the mass density, and $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity.\n\nNext, we apply the boundary-layer approximations. For a thin boundary layer where the thickness $\\delta \\ll x$, we have $v \\ll u$ and derivatives with respect to $x$ are much smaller than derivatives with respect to $y$, i.e., $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\ll \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$. The $y$-momentum equation simplifies to $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y} \\approx 0$, which implies that the pressure does not vary across the boundary layer. Since the problem specifies a zero streamwise pressure gradient in the free stream, $\\frac{dp}{dx} = 0$ everywhere within the flow. In the $x$-momentum equation, the term $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}$ is neglected compared to $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}$.\n\nThe simplified boundary layer equations are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = 0 $$\n$$ u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} $$\nThe boundary conditions are the no-slip condition at the wall ($y=0$) and matching the free-stream velocity $U$ far from the wall ($y\\to\\infty$):\n$$ u(x, 0) = 0, \\quad v(x, 0) = 0, \\quad u(x, y \\to \\infty) = U $$\n\nTo solve this system, we introduce a similarity transformation. The continuity equation is satisfied by defining a stream function $\\psi(x, y)$ such that $u = \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial y}$ and $v = -\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x}$. We seek a self-similar solution by defining a dimensionless similarity variable $\\eta$ and a dimensionless stream function $f(\\eta)$:\n$$ \\eta = y \\sqrt{\\frac{U}{\\nu x}} $$\n$$ \\psi(x, y) = \\sqrt{U \\nu x} f(\\eta) $$\nThe velocity components are then expressed in terms of $f$ and its derivatives with respect to $\\eta$ (denoted by primes):\n$$ u = \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\eta} \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial y} = \\sqrt{U \\nu x} f'(\\eta) \\sqrt{\\frac{U}{\\nu x}} = U f'(\\eta) $$\n$$ v = -\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left[ \\sqrt{U \\nu x} f(\\eta) \\right] = -\\left[ \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{U \\nu}{x}} f(\\eta) + \\sqrt{U \\nu x} f'(\\eta) \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial x} \\right] $$\nWith $\\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial x} = y \\sqrt{\\frac{U}{\\nu}} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} x^{-3/2}\\right) = -\\frac{\\eta}{2x}$, we find:\n$$ v = -\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{U \\nu}{x}} f(\\eta) - \\sqrt{U \\nu x} f'(\\eta) \\left(-\\frac{\\eta}{2x}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{U \\nu}{x}} \\left[ \\eta f'(\\eta) - f(\\eta) \\right] $$\nNext, we compute the derivatives needed for the momentum equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = U f''(\\eta) \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{U \\eta}{2x} f''(\\eta) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = U f''(\\eta) \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial y} = U f''(\\eta) \\sqrt{\\frac{U}{\\nu x}} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} = U \\sqrt{\\frac{U}{\\nu x}} f'''(\\eta) \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial y} = \\frac{U^2}{\\nu x} f'''(\\eta) $$\nSubstituting these into the boundary layer momentum equation:\n$$ \\left(U f'\\right) \\left(-\\frac{U \\eta}{2x} f''\\right) + \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{U \\nu}{x}} \\left(\\eta f' - f\\right) \\left(U f'' \\sqrt{\\frac{U}{\\nu x}}\\right) = \\nu \\left(\\frac{U^2}{\\nu x} f'''\\right) $$\n$$ -\\frac{U^2 \\eta}{2x} f' f'' + \\frac{U^2}{2x} (\\eta f' - f) f'' = \\frac{U^2}{x} f''' $$\n$$ -\\frac{U^2 f f''}{2x} = \\frac{U^2 f'''}{x} $$\nThis simplifies to the Blasius equation, a third-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation:\n$$ f''' + \\frac{1}{2} f f'' = 0 $$\nThe boundary conditions in terms of the similarity variables are:\n$$ u(x,0)=0 \\implies U f'(0) = 0 \\implies f'(0)=0 $$\n$$ v(x,0)=0 \\implies \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{U\\nu}{x}}[0 \\cdot f'(0) - f(0)] = 0 \\implies f(0)=0 $$\n$$ u(x,\\infty)=U \\implies U f'(\\infty)=U \\implies f'(\\infty)=1 $$\n\nThe Blasius equation is solved numerically. The necessary results for this problem are the values of $f''(0)$ and the asymptotic behavior of $f(\\eta)$:\n$$ f''(0) \\approx 0.33206 $$\n$$ \\lim_{\\eta \\to \\infty} (\\eta - f(\\eta)) \\approx 1.72076 $$\nWe will use rounded values $f''(0) \\approx 0.332$ and $\\lim_{\\eta \\to \\infty} (\\eta - f(\\eta)) \\approx 1.721$.\n\nNow we derive the expressions for wall shear stress and displacement thickness. The wall shear stress $\\tau_w(x)$ is defined as:\n$$ \\tau_w(x) = \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\right)_{y=0} = \\rho \\nu \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\right)_{y=0} $$\nAt $y=0$, $\\eta=0$. Using the expression for $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}$:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\right)_{y=0} = U f''(0) \\sqrt{\\frac{U}{\\nu x}} $$\n$$ \\tau_w(x) = \\rho \\nu \\left( U f''(0) \\sqrt{\\frac{U}{\\nu x}} \\right) = \\rho U f''(0) \\sqrt{\\frac{U \\nu}{x}} $$\nUsing $f''(0) \\approx 0.332$, the analytical expression for $\\tau_w(x)$ is:\n$$ \\tau_w(x) = 0.332 \\rho U \\sqrt{\\frac{U \\nu}{x}} = 0.332 \\rho U^2 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu}{Ux}} $$\n\nThe displacement thickness $\\delta^*(x)$ is defined as:\n$$ \\delta^*(x) = \\int_0^\\infty \\left(1 - \\frac{u(x,y)}{U}\\right) dy $$\nSubstituting $u/U = f'(\\eta)$ and $dy = d\\eta / \\sqrt{U/(\\nu x)} = \\sqrt{\\nu x/U} d\\eta$:\n$$ \\delta^*(x) = \\int_0^\\infty (1 - f'(\\eta)) \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu x}{U}} d\\eta = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu x}{U}} \\int_0^\\infty (1 - f'(\\eta)) d\\eta $$\nThe integral is evaluated as $\\int_0^\\infty (1 - f'(\\eta)) d\\eta = [\\eta - f(\\eta)]_0^\\infty = \\lim_{\\eta \\to \\infty}(\\eta - f(\\eta)) - (0 - f(0))$. With $f(0)=0$, this becomes $\\lim_{\\eta \\to \\infty}(\\eta - f(\\eta)) \\approx 1.721$.\nThus, the analytical expression for $\\delta^*(x)$ is:\n$$ \\delta^*(x) = 1.721 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu x}{U}} $$\n\nFinally, we evaluate these expressions for the given operating conditions:\n$U = 0.75\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, $\\nu = 7.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{m}^{2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, $\\rho = 0.28\\,\\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$, and $x = 0.12\\,\\text{m}$.\n\nFor the wall shear stress $\\tau_w(x)$:\n$$ \\tau_w(0.12) = 0.332 \\times (0.28) \\times (0.75)^2 \\sqrt{\\frac{7.0 \\times 10^{-5}}{0.75 \\times 0.12}} $$\n$$ \\tau_w(0.12) = 0.332 \\times 0.28 \\times 0.5625 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{7.0 \\times 10^{-5}}{0.09}} $$\n$$ \\tau_w(0.12) = 0.052272 \\times \\sqrt{7.777... \\times 10^{-4}} \\approx 0.052272 \\times 0.027888... $$\n$$ \\tau_w(0.12) \\approx 0.0014578\\,\\text{Pa} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, $\\tau_w(0.12) = 1.46 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{Pa}$.\n\nFor the displacement thickness $\\delta^*(x)$:\n$$ \\delta^*(0.12) = 1.721 \\sqrt{\\frac{(7.0 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times 0.12}{0.75}} $$\n$$ \\delta^*(0.12) = 1.721 \\sqrt{\\frac{8.4 \\times 10^{-6}}{0.75}} = 1.721 \\sqrt{1.12 \\times 10^{-5}} $$\n$$ \\delta^*(0.12) \\approx 1.721 \\times 0.0033466... $$\n$$ \\delta^*(0.12) \\approx 0.005759... \\text{m} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, $\\delta^*(0.12) = 5.76 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}$.\n\nThe final results are $\\tau_w(x) = 1.46 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{Pa}$ and $\\delta^*(x) = 5.76 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}$.",
