The solution process may now proceed.\n\nThe one-dimensional heat conduction equation is\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nTo simplify the problem, we introduce the specified dimensionless temperature, $\\theta(x,t) = \\frac{T(x,t)-T_s}{T_0-T_s}$. We find the partial derivatives of $T(x,t) = T_s + (T_0-T_s)\\theta(x,t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = (T_0-T_s) \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} = (T_0-T_s) \\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the heat equation, we obtain the governing equation for $\\theta(x,t)$:\n$$\n(T_0-T_s) \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t} = \\alpha (T_0-T_s) \\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta}{\\partial x^2} \\implies \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nThe initial and boundary conditions must also be transformed:\n-   Initial Condition at $t=0$: $\\theta(x,0) = \\frac{T(x,0)-T_s}{T_0-T_s} = \\frac{T_0-T_s}{T_0-T_s} = 1$.\n-   Boundary Condition at $x=0$: $\\theta(0,t) = \\frac{T(0,t)-T_s}{T_0-T_s} = \\frac{T_s-T_s}{T_0-T_s} = 0$.\n-   Boundary Condition at $x=L$: $\\theta(L,t) = \\frac{T(L,t)-T_s}{T_0-T_s} = \\frac{T_s-T_s}{T_0-T_s} = 0$.\n\nThe problem is now to solve the homogeneous PDE $\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta}{\\partial x^2}$ with homogeneous boundary conditions $\\theta(0,t)=0$, $\\theta(L,t)=0$ and a non-homogeneous initial condition $\\theta(x,0)=1$. We use the method of separation of variables, assuming a solution of the form $\\theta(x,t) = X(x)\\mathcal{T}(t)$. Substituting into the PDE and separating yields:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\alpha \\mathcal{T}} \\frac{d\\mathcal{T}}{dt} = \\frac{1}{X} \\frac{d^2X}{dx^2} = -k^2\n$$\nwhere $-k^2$ is the separation constant. This gives two ordinary differential equations:\n1.  $\\frac{d^2X}{dx^2} + k^2 X = 0$\n2.  $\\frac{d\\mathcal{T}}{dt} + \\alpha k^2 \\mathcal{T} = 0$\n\nThe general solution for the spatial equation is $X(x) = C_1 \\cos(kx) + C_2 \\sin(kx)$. Applying the boundary conditions:\n-   $X(0)=0 \\implies C_1 \\cos(0) + C_2 \\sin(0) = C_1 = 0$. So, $X(x) = C_2 \\sin(kx)$.\n-   $X(L)=0 \\implies C_2 \\sin(kL) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution ($C_2 \\neq 0$), we require $\\sin(kL)=0$, which implies $kL = n\\pi$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$.\nThe eigenvalues are $k_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}$, and the corresponding eigenfunctions are $X_n(x) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)$.\n\nThe solution for the temporal equation for each $k_n$ is $\\mathcal{T}_n(t) = C_n \\exp(-\\alpha k_n^2 t) = C_n \\exp\\left(-\\alpha \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 t\\right)$.\n\nThe general solution for $\\theta(x,t)$ is a superposition of all product solutions:\n$$\n\\theta(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n \\exp\\left(-\\alpha \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 t\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)\n$$\nThe coefficients $C_n$ are determined from the initial condition, $\\theta(x,0)=1$:\n$$\n1 = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the Fourier sine series of the function $f(x)=1$ on the interval $[0,L]$. The coefficients are given by:\n$$\nC_n = \\frac{2}{L} \\int_0^L 1 \\cdot \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) dx = \\frac{2}{L} \\left[-\\frac{L}{n\\pi} \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\right]_0^L\n$$\n$$\nC_n = -\\frac{2}{n\\pi} (\\cos(n\\pi) - \\cos(0)) = -\\frac{2}{n\\pi}((-1)^n-1)\n$$\nIf $n$ is even, $n=2m$, then $C_{2m} = 0$.\nIf $n$ is odd, $n=2m-1$, then $C_{2m-1} = -\\frac{2}{(2m-1)\\pi}(-1-1) = \\frac{4}{(2m-1)\\pi}$.\n\nThe complete solution for the dimensionless temperature is:\n$$\n\\theta(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1,3,5,...}^{\\infty} \\frac{4}{n\\pi} \\exp\\left(-\\alpha \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 t\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)\n$$\nWe need to find the time $t_{1\\%}$ such that $\\max_{x \\in [0,L]} |\\theta(x,t)| \\leq 0.01$ for $t \\geq t_{1\\%}$. Based on the maximum principle, and since $\\theta(x,0)=1>0$ and boundary values are $0$, we have $0 \\leq \\theta(x,t) \\leq 1$, so $|\\theta(x,t)|=\\theta(x,t)$. The maximum of $\\theta(x,t)$ with respect to $x$ occurs at the wafer's centerline, $x=L/2$, where all sine terms contribute maximally.\n\nThe problem asks to use a conservative criterion based on the slowest-decaying mode. The exponential terms $\\exp\\left(-\\alpha \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 t\\right)$ decay with $n^2$. The $n=1$ mode is the slowest to decay. For sufficiently large $t$, this first mode dominates the series. We therefore approximate the solution by its first term:\n$$\n\\theta(x,t) \\approx \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\exp\\left(-\\alpha \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 t\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)\n$$\nThe maximum value of this approximate solution occurs at $x=L/2$:\n$$\n\\max_{x \\in [0,L]} \\theta(x,t) \\approx \\theta(L/2,t) \\approx \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\exp\\left(-\\alpha \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 t\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi(L/2)}{L}\\right) = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\exp\\left(-\\alpha \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 t\\right)\n$$\nWe set this maximum value to be equal to $0.01$ at $t = t_{1\\%}$:\n$$\n\\frac{4}{\\pi} \\exp\\left(-\\alpha \\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2} t_{1\\%}\\right) = 0.01\n$$\nNow, we solve for $t_{1\\%}$:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\alpha \\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2} t_{1\\%}\\right) = \\frac{0.01 \\pi}{4}\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n-\\alpha \\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2} t_{1\\%} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.01 \\pi}{4}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{400}\\right) = -\\ln\\left(\\frac{400}{\\pi}\\right)\n$$\nFinally, isolating $t_{1\\%}$:\n$$\nt_{1\\%} = \\frac{L^2}{\\alpha \\pi^2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{400}{\\pi}\\right)\n$$\nThis expression provides the required time in terms of $\\alpha$ and $L$ only, as requested.",

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe governing equation for one-dimensional, steady-state heat conduction with uniform internal heat generation $g$ and constant thermal conductivity $k$ is derived from the conservation of energy. In Cartesian coordinates, the heat equation is:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( k \\frac{dT}{dx} \\right) + g = 0 $$\nAssuming $k$ is constant, this simplifies to a second-order ordinary differential equation for the temperature distribution $T(x)$:\n$$ \\frac{d^{2}T}{dx^{2}} = -\\frac{g}{k} $$\n\nNext, we establish the boundary conditions for the domain $x \\in [0, L]$.\nThe first boundary condition is at the mid-plane, $x=0$. The problem states a symmetry condition, which implies that the temperature distribution is an even function of $x$. This means the heat flux at the mid-plane is zero, leading to a zero temperature gradient:\n$$ \\text{BC1: } \\left. \\frac{dT}{dx} \\right|_{x=0} = 0 $$\nThe second boundary condition is at the exposed surface, $x=L$. At this surface, the heat conducted to the surface from the interior must be balanced by the heat lost to the environment via convection and radiation. The heat flux conducted to the surface is given by Fourier's law, $q''_{cond} = -k \\frac{dT}{dx}$.

The rate of change of thermal energy within this volume is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{dE_i}{dt} = \\rho c_p A \\Delta x \\frac{dT_i}{dt}\n$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density, $c_p$ is the specific heat, $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the wafer (assumed constant), and $\\frac{dT_i}{dt}$ is the time rate of change of the average temperature in the control volume, represented by the nodal temperature $T_i$.\n\nThe net rate of heat conducted into the control volume is the heat flux entering at face $x_{i-1/2}$ minus the heat flux exiting at face $x_{i+1/2}$:\n$$\nq_{\\text{net}} = q_{i-1/2} - q_{i+1/2}\n$$\nUsing Fourier's law and approximating the temperature gradients with centered differences at the control volume faces, we have:\n$$\nq_{i-1/2} \\approx -k A \\left(\\frac{T_i - T_{i-1}}{\\Delta x}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nq_{i+1/2} \\approx -k A \\left(\\frac{T_{i+1} - T_i}{\\Delta x}\\right)\n$$\nThe energy balance, $\\frac{dE_i}{dt} = q_{\\text{net}}$, becomes:\n$$\n\\rho c_p A \\Delta x \\frac{dT_i}{dt} = -k A \\left(\\frac{T_i - T_{i-1}}{\\Delta x}\\right) - \\left(-k A \\left(\\frac{T_{i+1} - T_i}{\\Delta x}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nSimplifying and dividing by $\\rho c_p A \\Delta x$:\n$$\n\\frac{dT_i}{dt} = \\frac{k}{\\rho c_p} \\frac{T_{i-1} - 2T_i + T_{i+1}}{(\\Delta x)^2}\n$$\nUsing the definition of thermal diffusivity, $\\alpha = k/(\\rho c_p)$, we obtain the semi-discretized equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dT_i}{dt} = \\alpha \\frac{T_{i-1} - 2T_i + T_{i+1}}{(\\Delta x)^2}\n$$\nThe problem specifies a first-order implicit time discretization. This means we approximate the time derivative using a backward difference and evaluate the spatial derivative at the future time level, $t^{n+1}$. Let $T_i^n \\approx T(x_i, t^n)$.\n$$\n\\frac{T_i^{n+1} - T_i^n}{\\Delta t} = \\alpha \\frac{T_{i-1}^{n+1} - 2T_i^{n+1} + T_{i+1}^{n+1}}{(\\Delta x)^2}\n$$\nLet us define the non-dimensional parameter $r = \\frac{\\alpha \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2}$, often called the Fourier number for the grid. Multiplying the equation by $\\Delta t$ yields:\n$$\nT_i^{n+1} - T_i^n = r (T_{i-1}^{n+1} - 2T_i^{n+1} + T_{i+1}^{n+1})\n$$\nRearranging the equation to group the unknown terms at time level $n+1$ on the left-hand side (LHS) and known terms at time level $n$ on the right-hand side (RHS), we get the fully implicit scheme for an interior node $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N-1\\}$:\n$$\n-r T_{i-1}^{n+1} + (1 + 2r) T_i^{n+1} - r T_{i+1}^{n+1} = T_i^n\n$$\nThis set of equations for $i = 1, \\dots, N-1$ forms a linear system of equations $A \\mathbf{T}^{n+1} = \\mathbf{b}$, where $\\mathbf{T}^{n+1} = [T_{1}^{n+1}, T_{2}^{n+1}, \\dots, T_{N-1}^{n+1}]^{\\top}$. The boundary conditions are given as $T_{0}^{n+1} = T_{\\mathrm{L}}^{n+1}$ and $T_{N}^{n+1} = T_{\\mathrm{R}}^{n+1}$.\n\nFor the first interior node, $i=1$:\n$$\n-r T_{0}^{n+1} + (1 + 2r) T_1^{n+1} - r T_{2}^{n+1} = T_1^n\n$$\nSince $T_{0}^{n+1}$ is a known boundary value, we move it to the RHS:\n$$\n(1 + 2r) T_1^{n+1} - r T_{2}^{n+1} = T_1^n + r T_{\\mathrm{L}}^{n+1}\n$$\nFor the last interior node, $i=N-1$:\n$$\n-r T_{N-2}^{n+1} + (1 + 2r) T_{N-1}^{n+1} - r T_{N}^{n+1} = T_{N-1}^n\n$$\nSince $T_{N}^{n+1}$ is a known boundary value, we move it to the RHS:\n$$\n-r T_{N-2}^{n+1} + (1 + 2r) T_{N-1}^{n+1} = T_{N-1}^n + r T_{\\mathrm{R}}^{n+1}\n$$\nThe resulting $(N-1) \\times (N-1)$ matrix $A$ is a tridiagonal matrix with the following coefficients:\n- Main diagonal entries: $a_{i,i} = 1 + 2r$ for $i=1, \\dots, N-1$.\n- Sub-diagonal entries: $a_{i,i-1} = -r$ for $i=2, \\dots, N-1$.\n- Super-diagonal entries: $a_{i,i+1} = -r$ for $i=1, \\dots, N-2$.\n\nThe RHS vector $\\mathbf{b}$ has the following components:\n- $b_1 = T_1^n + r T_{\\mathrm{L}}^{n+1}$\n- $b_i = T_i^n$ for $i=2, \\dots, N-2$\n- $b_{N-1} = T_{N-1}^n + r T_{\\mathrm{R}}^{n+1}$\n\n**Part 2: Stability Analysis**\n\nTo perform the Fourier (von Neumann) stability analysis, we investigate how the amplitude of a single Fourier mode of the numerical error evolves in time. We consider an infinite grid to neglect boundary effects. Let the error at grid point $i$ and time level $n$ be $\\epsilon_i^n$. A single Fourier mode can be represented as:\n$$\n\\epsilon_i^n = \\hat{\\epsilon}^n e^{j i \\theta}\n$$\nwhere $j = \\sqrt{-1}$ is the imaginary unit, $\\hat{\\epsilon}^n$ is the complex amplitude of the mode at time level $n$, and $\\theta = K \\Delta x$ is the dimensionless wavenumber, with $K$ being the wavenumber. The error must also satisfy the homogeneous form of the finite difference equation:\n$$\n-r \\epsilon_{i-1}^{n+1} + (1 + 2r) \\epsilon_i^{n+1} - r \\epsilon_{i+1}^{n+1} = \\epsilon_i^n\n$$\nThe amplification factor $G(\\theta)$ is defined as the ratio of amplitudes at successive time steps, $G(\\theta) = \\hat{\\epsilon}^{n+1} / \\hat{\\epsilon}^n$. Thus, we can write $\\epsilon_i^{n+1} = G(\\theta) \\epsilon_i^n = G(\\theta) \\hat{\\epsilon}^n e^{j i \\theta}$. Substituting this into the finite difference equation yields:\n$$\n-r G(\\theta) \\hat{\\epsilon}^n e^{j (i-1) \\theta} + (1 + 2r) G(\\theta) \\hat{\\epsilon}^n e^{j i \\theta} - r G(\\theta) \\hat{\\epsilon}^n e^{j (i+1) \\theta} = \\hat{\\epsilon}^n e^{j i \\theta}\n$$\nWe divide the entire equation by $\\hat{\\epsilon}^n e^{j i \\theta}$ (which is non-zero):\n$$\n-r G(\\theta) e^{-j \\theta} + (1 + 2r) G(\\theta) - r G(\\theta) e^{j \\theta} = 1\n$$\nFactoring out $G(\\theta)$:\n$$\nG(\\theta) \\left[ (1 + 2r) - r (e^{j \\theta} + e^{-j \\theta}) \\right] = 1\n$$\nUsing Euler's identity, $e^{j \\theta} + e^{-j \\theta} = 2\\cos(\\theta)$, we get:\n$$\nG(\\theta) \\left[ 1 + 2r - 2r \\cos(\\theta) \\right] = 1\n$$\nSolving for the amplification factor $G(\\theta)$:\n$$\nG(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{1 + 2r(1 - \\cos(\\theta))}\n$$\nTo obtain a more compact form, we use the half-angle trigonometric identity $1 - \\cos(\\theta) = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$:\n$$\nG(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{1 + 2r(2\\sin^2(\\theta/2))} = \\frac{1}{1 + 4r\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Unconditional Stability**\n\nFor a numerical scheme to be stable, the magnitude of the amplification factor must not exceed unity for all possible wavenumbers, i.e., $|G(\\theta)| \\le 1$. The dimensionless wavenumber $\\theta$ ranges from $0$ to $\\pi$, covering all wavelengths resolvable by the grid from infinity down to the Nyquist limit of $2\\Delta x$.\n\nThe parameters in the expression for $G(\\theta)$ are $r = \\alpha \\Delta t / (\\Delta x)^2$ and $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$. The problem specifies that the thermal diffusivity $\\alpha > 0$. Since the time step $\\Delta t$ and grid spacing $\\Delta x$ are also positive, it follows that $r > 0$.\n\nLet's analyze the denominator of $G(\\theta)$, which is $D = 1 + 4r\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$.\nFor $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$, the term $\\theta/2$ is in the range $[0, \\pi/2]$.\nConsequently, $\\sin(\\theta/2)$ is in the range $[0, 1]$, and $\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ is also in the range $[0, 1]$.\nSince $r > 0$, the term $4r\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ is always non-negative.\nThe minimum value of the denominator $D$ occurs when $\\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 0$ (i.e., at $\\theta=0$), giving $D_{\\min} = 1 + 0 = 1$.\nThe maximum value of the denominator $D$ occurs when $\\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$ (i.e., at $\\theta=\\pi$), giving $D_{\\max} = 1 + 4r$.\nTherefore, for any valid $\\theta$ and any positive $r$, the denominator $D$ is always greater than or equal to $1$.\n\nThe amplification factor is $G(\\theta) = 1/D$. Since $D$ is real and $D \\ge 1$, $G(\\theta)$ is also real and positive, and its magnitude is:\n$$\n|G(\\theta)| = G(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{1 + 4r\\sin^2(\\theta/2)} \\le 1\n$$\nThis inequality holds for any positive value of $r$. Since $r$ depends on $\\Delta t$ and $\\Delta x$, the scheme is stable for any choice of $\\Delta t > 0$ and $\\Delta x > 0$. This is the definition of unconditional stability. The implicit nature of the scheme ensures that error modes are always damped and never grow, regardless of the time step size.\n\nThe final requested answer is the closed-form expression for the amplification factor $G(\\theta)$.",
