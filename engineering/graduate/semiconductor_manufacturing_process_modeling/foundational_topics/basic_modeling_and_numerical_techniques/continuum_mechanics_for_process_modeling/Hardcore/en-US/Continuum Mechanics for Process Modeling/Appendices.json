            "problem": "Consider a silicon wafer modeled as a one-dimensional thin plate of thickness $h$ with the thickness coordinate $z \\in [-h/2,h/2]$ measured from the mid-plane. The wafer experiences a through-thickness thermal mismatch characterized by a prescribed eigenstrain distribution $\\varepsilon_{T}(z)$ that is independent of the in-plane coordinate $x$. The wafer material may be inhomogeneous across the thickness, with a position-dependent Young’s modulus $E(z)$, but is isotropic and obeys linear elasticity in plane stress. Under classical thin plate (Kirchhoff–Love) kinematics, the displacement field is $(u_{x}(x,z),u_{z}(x)) = \\left(u_{0}(x) - z \\,\\frac{\\partial w(x)}{\\partial x},\\, w(x)\\right)$, where $u_{0}(x)$ is the in-plane mid-plane displacement and $w(x)$ is the transverse deflection. The curvature is defined kinematically by $\\kappa(x) = \\frac{\\partial^{2} w(x)}{\\partial x^{2}}$. Assume there are no external tractions or moments; the wafer is free, so the resultant in-plane force and bending moment across the thickness are zero.\n\nUsing only kinematic compatibility, linear elastic constitutive behavior, and force and moment equilibrium, derive a closed-form analytic expression for the curvature $\\kappa$ in terms of $E(z)$ and $\\varepsilon_{T}(z)$. Your derivation must start from the definition of in-plane strain as the gradient of the in-plane displacement under Kirchhoff–Love assumptions, and must relate $\\kappa$ to the quadratic variation of strain through the thickness. Assume all fields are uniform in $x$ (so that $\\kappa$ is constant in $x$), and the wafer bows only along $x$. Express the final curvature in terms of thickness integrals of $E(z)$ and $\\varepsilon_{T}(z)$ over $z \\in [-h/2,h/2]$. The final answer must be a single closed-form analytic expression for $\\kappa$. No numerical evaluation is required.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard problem in the continuum mechanics of thin plates, specifically the thermoelastic bending of a material with properties varying through its thickness. All necessary information and conditions are provided for a unique analytical solution.\n\nThe derivation of the curvature $\\kappa$ proceeds as follows, based on kinematics, constitutive relations, and equilibrium.\n\nFirst, we establish the total in-plane strain field $\\varepsilon_{xx}(x,z)$ based on the provided Kirchhoff-Love displacement field. The displacement in the $x$-direction is given as $u_x(x,z) = u_0(x) - z \\frac{\\partial w(x)}{\\partial x}$. The in-plane strain is the spatial derivative of the displacement with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{xx}(x,z) = \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( u_0(x) - z \\frac{\\partial w(x)}{\\partial x} \\right)\n$$\nPerforming the differentiation gives:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{xx}(x,z) = \\frac{\\partial u_0(x)}{\\partial x} - z \\frac{\\partial^2 w(x)}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nWe identify the term $\\frac{\\partial u_0(x)}{\\partial x}$ as the strain of the mid-plane, denoted $\\varepsilon_0(x)$, and the term $\\frac{\\partial^2 w(x)}{\\partial x^2}$ as the curvature of the plate, denoted $\\kappa(x)$. The problem states that all fields are uniform in the $x$-direction, which implies that $\\varepsilon_0$ and $\\kappa$ are constants. Thus, the total strain through the thickness is a linear function of the thickness coordinate $z$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{xx}(z) = \\varepsilon_0 - z \\kappa\n$$\nThis equation represents the kinematic compatibility of the plate.\n\nNext, we establish the stress field $\\sigma_{xx}(z)$ using the linear elastic constitutive law. The total strain $\\varepsilon_{xx}$ is the sum of the mechanical strain $\\varepsilon_{\\text{mech}}$ (which causes stress) and the prescribed eigenstrain $\\varepsilon_T(z)$.\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{xx}(z) = \\varepsilon_{\\text{mech}}(z) + \\varepsilon_T(z)\n$$\nThe in-plane stress $\\sigma_{xx}$ under plane stress conditions is related to the mechanical strain by the position-dependent Young's modulus $E(z)$.

The change in area per unit base area is:\n        $$\n        \\Delta S_{area} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\int_0^\\lambda (ds - dx) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\int_0^\\lambda \\frac{1}{2} (w')^2 dx\n        $$\n        With $w'(x) = -A k \\sin(k x)$, we have $(w')^2 = A^2 k^2 \\sin^2(k x)$. The average change in area is:\n        $$\n        \\Delta S_{area} = \\frac{1}{2} A^2 k^2 \\langle \\sin^2(k x) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} A^2 k^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4} A^2 k^2\n        $$\n        The surface energy change per unit area is thus:\n        $$\n        \\Delta U_{surf} = \\gamma \\Delta S_{area} = \\frac{1}{4} \\gamma A^2 k^2\n        $$\n\n    -   **Substrate Elastic Energy ($\\Delta U_{sub}$):** The problem states that for a sinusoidal displacement on an incompressible elastic half-space, the required traction amplitude is proportional to $k$ times the displacement amplitude. For an incompressible substrate with shear modulus $\\mu_s$, the normal traction amplitude $p_0$ required to produce a surface displacement of amplitude $A$ and wavenumber $k$ is $p_0 = 2 \\mu_s k A$. The work done by this traction creates the substrate strain energy. The energy change per unit area is:\n        $$\n        \\Delta U_{sub} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\int_0^\\lambda \\frac{1}{2} p(x) w(x) dx = \\frac{1}{2} \\langle (p_0 \\cos(k x))(A \\cos(k x)) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} p_0 A \\langle \\cos^2(k x) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{4} p_0 A\n        $$\n        Substituting $p_0 = 2 \\mu_s k A$, we get:\n        $$\n        \\Delta U_{sub} = \\frac{1}{4} (2 \\mu_s k A) A = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_s k A^2\n        $$\n\n    -   **Compressive Force Potential Energy ($\\Delta U_{comp}$):** The compressive force per unit width, $N = E' t_f \\varepsilon_0$, does work as the film buckles. The shortening of the film's horizontal projection due to buckling is the difference between the arc length and the projected length. Per unit length, this shortening is $\\frac{1}{4} A^2 k^2$, as calculated for the surface area change. The work done by the force $N$ releases potential energy from the system. The change in potential energy is the negative of the work done:\n        $$\n        \\Delta U_{comp} = -N \\times (\\text{average shortening}) = -N \\left(\\frac{1}{4} A^2 k^2\\right) = -\\frac{1}{4} N A^2 k^2\n        $$\n\n    -   **Total Energy Change:** Summing all contributions, the total energy change per unit area to quadratic order in $A$ is:\n        $$\n        \\Delta U(k, A) = \\Delta U_{bend} + \\Delta U_{surf} + \\Delta U_{sub} + \\Delta U_{comp}\n        $$\n        $$\n        \\Delta U(k, A) = \\frac{1}{4} B A^2 k^4 + \\frac{1}{4} \\gamma A^2 k^2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_s k A^2 - \\frac{1}{4} N A^2 k^2\n        $$\n        $$\n        \\Delta U(k, A) = \\left( \\frac{1}{4} B k^4 + \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_s k + \\frac{1}{4} \\gamma k^2 - \\frac{1}{4} N k^2 \\right) A^2\n        $$\n\n2.  **Condition for Onset of Buckling**\n\n    Buckling occurs when the initially flat configuration becomes unstable. This happens when the energy change $\\Delta U$ for a small deflection is no longer positive. The critical condition for the onset of buckling is when the coefficient of $A^2$ in $\\Delta U(k, A)$ vanishes:\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{4} B k^4 + \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_s k + \\frac{1}{4} \\gamma k^2 - \\frac{1}{4} N_c k^2 = 0\n    $$\n    where $N_c(k)$ is the critical compressive force for a mode of wavenumber $k$. Solving for $N_c(k)$ (for $k \\neq 0$):\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{4} N_c k^2 = \\frac{1}{4} B k^4 + \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_s k + \\frac{1}{4} \\gamma k^2\n    $$\n    $$\n    N_c(k) = B k^2 + \\frac{2 \\mu_s}{k} + \\gamma\n    $$\n    The corresponding critical strain is $\\varepsilon_c(k) = N_c(k) / (E' t_f)$. We use the plane strain modulus $E' = E_f/(1-\\nu_f^2)$ and $B = E' t_f^3/12$:\n    $$\n    \\varepsilon_c(k) = \\frac{1}{E' t_f} \\left( B k^2 + \\frac{2 \\mu_s}{k} + \\gamma \\right) = \\frac{t_f^2}{12} k^2 + \\frac{2 \\mu_s}{E' t_f k} + \\frac{\\gamma}{E' t_f}\n    $$\n\n3.  **Bending-Dominated Scaling Law**\n\n    The expression for the critical strain $\\varepsilon_c(k)$ is a sum of three terms corresponding to bending resistance, substrate resistance, and surface energy resistance. The bending-dominated term is the one containing the bending stiffness $B$. The contribution to the critical strain from bending is:\n    $$\n    \\varepsilon_{c, \\text{bend}} = \\frac{t_f^2}{12} k^2\n    $$\n    The problem asks for this scaling law in terms of the wavelength $\\lambda = 2\\pi/k$. Substituting $k = 2\\pi/\\lambda$:\n    $$\n    \\varepsilon_{c, \\text{bend}} = \\frac{t_f^2}{12} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 t_f^2}{12 \\lambda^2} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{3} \\left(\\frac{t_f}{\\lambda}\\right)^2\n    $$\n    This expression has the form $\\varepsilon_c \\sim (t_f/\\lambda)^2$ with the explicit prefactor being $\\pi^2/3$. Thus, the scaling law is $\\varepsilon_c = \\frac{\\pi^2}{3} \\left(\\frac{t_f}{\\lambda}\\right)^2$.\n\n4.  **Optimal Wrinkle Wavelength**\n\n    The system will buckle at the wavelength that requires the minimum critical force. To find this preferred wavelength, we minimize $N_c(k)$ with respect to the wavenumber $k$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d N_c(k)}{dk} = \\frac{d}{dk} \\left( B k^2 + \\frac{2 \\mu_s}{k} + \\gamma \\right) = 2 B k - \\frac{2 \\mu_s}{k^2}\n    $$\n    Setting the derivative to zero to find the optimal wavenumber $k^*$:\n    $$\n    2 B k^* - \\frac{2 \\mu_s}{(k^*)^2} = 0 \\implies k^* = \\left(\\frac{\\mu_s}{B}\\right)^{1/3}\n    $$\n    The second derivative, $\\frac{d^2 N_c}{dk^2} = 2B + \\frac{4\\mu_s}{k^3}$, is positive for physical parameters ($B0, \\mu_s0$), confirming this is a minimum. The selected wavelength $\\lambda^*$ is given by $\\lambda^* = 2\\pi/k^*$:\n    $$\n    \\lambda^* = 2\\pi \\left(\\frac{B}{\\mu_s}\\right)^{1/3}\n    $$\n    Substituting the expression for the bending stiffness $B = \\frac{E_f t_f^3}{12(1-\\nu_f^2)}$:\n    $$\n    \\lambda^* = 2\\pi \\left(\\frac{E_f t_f^3}{12(1-\\nu_f^2) \\mu_s}\\right)^{1/3}\n    $$\n    Factoring out the film thickness $t_f$:\n    $$\n    \\lambda^* = 2\\pi t_f \\left(\\frac{E_f}{12(1-\\nu_f^2) \\mu_s}\\right)^{1/3}\n    $$\n    This is the closed-form expression for the optimal wavelength in terms of the specified material and geometric parameters.",
