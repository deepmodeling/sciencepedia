The stiffness tensor has two independent constants and is given by:\n$$C_{ijkl} = \\lambda \\, \\delta_{ij} \\delta_{kl} + \\mu \\, (\\delta_{ik} \\delta_{jl} + \\delta_{il} \\delta_{jk})$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$ are the Lamé parameters. The stress-strain relations are:\n$$\n\\sigma_{ij} = \\lambda \\, \\varepsilon^m_{kk} \\delta_{ij} + 2\\mu \\, \\varepsilon^m_{ij}\n$$\nThe plane stress condition $\\sigma_{33} = 0$ gives:\n$$\n\\sigma_{33} = \\lambda (\\varepsilon^m_{11} + \\varepsilon^m_{22} + \\varepsilon^m_{33}) + 2\\mu \\, \\varepsilon^m_{33} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting $\\varepsilon^m_{11} = \\varepsilon^m_{22} = (\\alpha_s - \\alpha_f)\\Delta T$:\n$$\n\\lambda (2(\\alpha_s - \\alpha_f)\\Delta T + \\varepsilon^m_{33}) + 2\\mu \\, \\varepsilon^m_{33} = 0\n$$\nSolving for the out-of-plane mechanical strain $\\varepsilon^m_{33}$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon^m_{33} = -\\frac{2\\lambda}{\\lambda+2\\mu} (\\alpha_s - \\alpha_f)\\Delta T\n$$\nNow we compute the in-plane stress $\\sigma = \\sigma_{11}$:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\lambda (\\varepsilon^m_{11} + \\varepsilon^m_{22} + \\varepsilon^m_{33}) + 2\\mu \\, \\varepsilon^m_{11}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma = \\lambda \\left( 2(\\alpha_s - \\alpha_f)\\Delta T - \\frac{2\\lambda}{\\lambda+2\\mu} (\\alpha_s - \\alpha_f)\\Delta T \\right) + 2\\mu (\\alpha_s - \\alpha_f)\\Delta T\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma = (\\alpha_s - \\alpha_f)\\Delta T \\left[ 2\\lambda \\left(1 - \\frac{\\lambda}{\\lambda+2\\mu}\\right) + 2\\mu \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma = (\\alpha_s - \\alpha_f)\\Delta T \\left[ 2\\lambda \\left(\\frac{2\\mu}{\\lambda+2\\mu}\\right) + 2\\mu \\right] = (\\alpha_s - \\alpha_f)\\Delta T \\left[ \\frac{4\\lambda\\mu + 2\\mu(\\lambda+2\\mu)}{\\lambda+2\\mu} \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma = (\\alpha_s - \\alpha_f)\\Delta T \\left[ \\frac{2\\mu(3\\lambda + 2\\mu)}{\\lambda + 2\\mu} \\right]\n$$\nUsing the standard relations between Lamé parameters and Young's modulus $E$ and Poisson's ratio $\\nu$: $E = \\frac{\\mu(3\\lambda+2\\mu)}{\\lambda+\\mu}$ and $\\nu = \\frac{\\lambda}{2(\\lambda+\\mu)}$, the term in brackets simplifies to the biaxial modulus, $\\frac{E}{1-\\nu}$.\nThus, the stress is:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu} (\\alpha_s - \\alpha_f)\\Delta T\n$$\n\n**Case 2: Transversely Isotropic Film**\n\nThe material symmetry restriction for a transversely isotropic material with its symmetry axis along the z-direction (film normal) is invariance of $\\mathbf{C}$ under all rotations about the z-axis and reflections through planes containing the z-axis.

Under the isotropic assumption and plane stress, the equi-biaxial residual stress in the film is $\\sigma = \\dfrac{E}{1 - \\nu} \\, (\\alpha_s - \\alpha_f)\\, \\Delta T$, where $E$ is Young’s modulus and $\\nu$ is Poisson’s ratio of the film. The material symmetry restriction on $\\mathbf{C}$ is invariance under all rotations in three dimensions, and $\\mathbf{C}$ can be written as $C_{ijkl} = \\lambda \\, \\delta_{ij} \\delta_{kl} + \\mu \\, (\\delta_{ik} \\delta_{jl} + \\delta_{il} \\delta_{jk})$, with $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$ the Lamé parameters and $\\delta_{ij}$ the Kronecker delta.**\n- The derived stress formula $\\sigma = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu} (\\alpha_s - \\alpha_f)\\Delta T$ perfectly matches the one in the option.\n- The description of the material symmetry restriction (invariance under all rotations, i.e., isotropy) and the general form of the isotropic stiffness tensor $\\mathbf{C}$ are both correct.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Under the transversely isotropic assumption with symmetry axis aligned with the film normal, and plane stress, the equi-biaxial residual stress in the film is $\\sigma = \\left(c_{11} + c_{12} - \\dfrac{2 c_{13}^2}{c_{33}}\\right) \\, (\\alpha_s - \\alpha_f)\\, \\Delta T$, where $c_{11}$, $c_{12}$, $c_{13}$, $c_{33}$, and $c_{44}$ are the five independent stiffness constants of a transversely isotropic solid in Voigt notation and $c_{66} = \\dfrac{c_{11} - c_{12}}{2}$. The material symmetry restriction on $\\mathbf{C}$ is invariance under all rotations about the symmetry axis and reflections through planes containing the axis.**\n- The derived stress formula $\\sigma = \\left( c_{11} + c_{12} - \\frac{2c_{13}^2}{c_{33}} \\right) (\\alpha_s - \\alpha_f)\\Delta T$ perfectly matches the one in the option.\n- The description of the five independent elastic constants, the constraint on $c_{66}$, and the material symmetry properties are all correct for a transversely isotropic material.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Under the isotropic assumption, the material symmetry restriction on $\\mathbf{C}$ is invariance only under rotations about the film normal, leading to three independent elastic constants in $\\mathbf{C}$.**\n- This statement is incorrect. True isotropy requires invariance under all rotations about all axes, not just one. Invariance about a single axis defines transverse isotropy, which has five independent constants. An isotropic material has only two independent elastic constants.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Under the transversely isotropic assumption with symmetry axis normal to the film, the in-plane equi-biaxial residual stress reduces to $\\sigma = (c_{11} - c_{12}) \\, (\\alpha_s - \\alpha_f)\\, \\Delta T$ because the plane stress condition $\\sigma_{zz} = 0$ eliminates coupling to $\\varepsilon_{zz}$.**\n- The reasoning is flawed. The condition $\\sigma_{zz} = 0$ does not eliminate coupling; rather, it is used to determine the out-of-plane strain $\\varepsilon_{zz}$ (or $\\varepsilon^m_{33}$) in terms of the in-plane strains. Our derivation shows that a non-zero $\\varepsilon^m_{33}$ exists and it contributes to the in-plane stress through the $c_{13}$ constant, leading to the term $-2c_{13}^2/c_{33}$. The formula provided in the option is therefore incorrect.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Under the isotropic assumption and plane stress, the equi-biaxial residual stress in the film is $\\sigma = \\dfrac{E}{1 + \\nu} \\, (\\alpha_s - \\alpha_f)\\, \\Delta T$, and the material symmetry restriction excludes reflections, requiring invariance only under proper rotations.**\n- The stress formula is incorrect. The denominator should be $(1 - \\nu)$, not $(1 + \\nu)$. The quantity $\\frac{E}{1+\\nu}$ is equal to $2\\mu$.\n- The material symmetry part describes a chiral (hemitropic) solid, not a standard isotropic one which is also invariant under reflections. But more importantly, the stress formula is wrong.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

            "problem": "A compressively stressed thin film deposited during semiconductor manufacturing spontaneously forms wrinkles whose wavelength reflects a competition among elastic bending, substrate deformation, and surface energy. Consider a stiff thin film of thickness $t_{f}$, Young’s modulus $E_{f}$, and Poisson’s ratio $\\nu_{f}$, perfectly bonded to a semi-infinite soft elastic substrate with shear modulus $\\mu_{s}$ and Poisson’s ratio $\\nu_{s}$, with its top surface exposed to a process fluid characterized by surface energy (surface tension) $\\gamma$. The film is subjected to a uniform in-plane compressive strain $\\varepsilon_{0}$ (for example, due to thermal mismatch in deposition). Assume plane strain in the film so the in-plane modulus is $E' = E_{f}/(1 - \\nu_{f}^{2})$, and model the out-of-plane deflection as a single sinusoidal mode $w(x) = A \\cos(k x)$ of small amplitude $A$ and wavenumber $k = 2\\pi/\\lambda$, where $\\lambda$ is the wrinkle wavelength. The film bending stiffness is $B = \\dfrac{E_{f} t_{f}^{3}}{12(1 - \\nu_{f}^{2})}$.\n\nUsing the kinematics of the Föppl–von Kármán (FvK) plate theory and linear elasticity for the substrate, proceed as follows:\n\n1. Starting from the definitions of bending energy in an elastic plate, surface energy associated with increased area of a gently corrugated surface, substrate elastic energy for a sinusoidal surface displacement of an elastic half-space, and the potential energy change due to an imposed in-plane compressive force per unit width $N = E' t_{f} \\varepsilon_{0}$, derive the total change in energy per unit base area, $\\Delta U(k, A)$, to quadratic order in the amplitude $A$.\n\n2. Deduce the condition for the onset of buckling by requiring the coefficient of $A^{2}$ in $\\Delta U(k, A)$ to vanish, thereby obtaining the critical in-plane compressive force per unit width $N_{c}(k)$ as a function of $k$, and hence the critical strain $\\varepsilon_{c}(k) = N_{c}(k)/(E' t_{f})$.\n\n3. From your expression for $\\varepsilon_{c}(k)$, extract the bending-dominated scaling law for the critical strain of a thin film mode of wavelength $\\lambda$. Show that this scaling has the form $\\varepsilon_{c} \\sim (t_{f}/\\lambda)^{2}$ and provide the explicit prefactor implied by your derivation under plane strain.\n\n4. Predict the selected wrinkle wavelength at the onset of buckling by minimizing the sum of elastic bending and substrate deformation contributions (with the surface energy included consistently in the energetics). That is, minimize $N_{c}(k)$ with respect to $k$ and obtain a closed-form expression for the optimal wavelength $\\lambda^{\\ast}$ in terms of $E_{f}$, $\\nu_{f}$, $t_{f}$, and $\\mu_{s}$. Assume the substrate behaves as an incompressible elastic half-space for the sinusoidal loading so that the substrate traction amplitude is proportional to $k$ times the displacement amplitude.\n\nProvide your final answers as exact symbolic expressions. Do not perform any numerical evaluation. No rounding is required. The final answer must include two entries: the bending-dominated $\\varepsilon_{c}$–$\\lambda$ scaling and the expression for $\\lambda^{\\ast}$.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. The premises are based on established principles of continuum mechanics, specifically Föppl–von Kármán plate theory and linear elasticity, which are standard for analyzing thin film buckling phenomena. The problem provides all necessary definitions, variables, and physical parameters to derive the requested quantities. The tasks are logically sequenced, guiding the derivation from first principles to specific physical predictions. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution is provided below.\n\nThe total change in energy per unit base area, $\\Delta U$, is the sum of the change in bending energy of the film ($\\Delta U_{bend}$), the change in surface energy of the exposed surface ($\\Delta U_{surf}$), the change in elastic strain energy of the substrate ($\\Delta U_{sub}$), and the change in potential energy of the compressive in-plane force ($\\Delta U_{comp}$). We analyze each contribution for a sinusoidal deflection $w(x) = A \\cos(k x)$, averaged over one wavelength $\\lambda = 2\\pi/k$.\n\n1.  **Derivation of the Total Energy Change $\\Delta U(k, A)$**\n\n    -   **Bending Energy ($\\Delta U_{bend}$):** The bending energy per unit area for a plate is given by $\\frac{1}{2} B \\kappa^2$, where $B = \\frac{E_f t_f^3}{12(1-\\nu_f^2)}$ is the bending stiffness under plane strain and $\\kappa$ is the curvature. For small deflections, the curvature is $\\kappa \\approx \\frac{d^2 w}{dx^2} = -A k^2 \\cos(k x)$. The energy density is $\\frac{1}{2} B (-A k^2 \\cos(k x))^2 = \\frac{1}{2} B A^2 k^4 \\cos^2(k x)$. The average energy change per unit area is:\n        $$\n        \\Delta U_{bend} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\int_0^\\lambda \\frac{1}{2} B A^2 k^4 \\cos^2(k x) dx = \\frac{1}{2} B A^2 k^4 \\langle \\cos^2(k x) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} B A^2 k^4 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4} B A^2 k^4\n        $$\n\n    -   **Surface Energy ($\\Delta U_{surf}$):** The change in surface energy is the surface tension $\\gamma$ multiplied by the change in surface area. The infinitesimal arc length is $ds = \\sqrt{1 + (w')^2} dx$, which for small slopes $w'(x)$ is approximated as $ds \\approx (1 + \\frac{1}{2}(w')^2) dx$. The change in area per unit base area is:\n        $$\n        \\Delta S_{area} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\int_0^\\lambda (ds - dx) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\int_0^\\lambda \\frac{1}{2} (w')^2 dx\n        $$\n        With $w'(x) = -A k \\sin(k x)$, we have $(w')^2 = A^2 k^2 \\sin^2(k x)$. The average change in area is:\n        $$\n        \\Delta S_{area} = \\frac{1}{2} A^2 k^2 \\langle \\sin^2(k x) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} A^2 k^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4} A^2 k^2\n        $$\n        The surface energy change per unit area is thus:\n        $$\n        \\Delta U_{surf} = \\gamma \\Delta S_{area} = \\frac{1}{4} \\gamma A^2 k^2\n        $$\n\n    -   **Substrate Elastic Energy ($\\Delta U_{sub}$):** The problem states that for a sinusoidal displacement on an incompressible elastic half-space, the required traction amplitude is proportional to $k$ times the displacement amplitude. For an incompressible substrate with shear modulus $\\mu_s$, the normal traction amplitude $p_0$ required to produce a surface displacement of amplitude $A$ and wavenumber $k$ is $p_0 = 2 \\mu_s k A$. The work done by this traction creates the substrate strain energy. The energy change per unit area is:\n        $$\n        \\Delta U_{sub} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\int_0^\\lambda \\frac{1}{2} p(x) w(x) dx = \\frac{1}{2} \\langle (p_0 \\cos(k x))(A \\cos(k x)) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} p_0 A \\langle \\cos^2(k x) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{4} p_0 A\n        $$\n        Substituting $p_0 = 2 \\mu_s k A$, we get:\n        $$\n        \\Delta U_{sub} = \\frac{1}{4} (2 \\mu_s k A) A = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_s k A^2\n        $$\n\n    -   **Compressive Force Potential Energy ($\\Delta U_{comp}$):** The compressive force per unit width, $N = E' t_f \\varepsilon_0$, does work as the film buckles. The shortening of the film's horizontal projection due to buckling is the difference between the arc length and the projected length. Per unit length, this shortening is $\\frac{1}{4} A^2 k^2$, as calculated for the surface area change. The work done by the force $N$ releases potential energy from the system. The change in potential energy is the negative of the work done:\n        $$\n        \\Delta U_{comp} = -N \\times (\\text{average shortening}) = -N \\left(\\frac{1}{4} A^2 k^2\\right) = -\\frac{1}{4} N A^2 k^2\n        $$\n\n    -   **Total Energy Change:** Summing all contributions, the total energy change per unit area to quadratic order in $A$ is:\n        $$\n        \\Delta U(k, A) = \\Delta U_{bend} + \\Delta U_{surf} + \\Delta U_{sub} + \\Delta U_{comp}\n        $$\n        $$\n        \\Delta U(k, A) = \\frac{1}{4} B A^2 k^4 + \\frac{1}{4} \\gamma A^2 k^2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_s k A^2 - \\frac{1}{4} N A^2 k^2\n        $$\n        $$\n        \\Delta U(k, A) = \\left( \\frac{1}{4} B k^4 + \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_s k + \\frac{1}{4} \\gamma k^2 - \\frac{1}{4} N k^2 \\right) A^2\n        $$\n\n2.  **Condition for Onset of Buckling**\n\n    Buckling occurs when the initially flat configuration becomes unstable. This happens when the energy change $\\Delta U$ for a small deflection is no longer positive. The critical condition for the onset of buckling is when the coefficient of $A^2$ in $\\Delta U(k, A)$ vanishes:\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{4} B k^4 + \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_s k + \\frac{1}{4} \\gamma k^2 - \\frac{1}{4} N_c k^2 = 0\n    $$\n    where $N_c(k)$ is the critical compressive force for a mode of wavenumber $k$. Solving for $N_c(k)$ (for $k \\neq 0$):\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{4} N_c k^2 = \\frac{1}{4} B k^4 + \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_s k + \\frac{1}{4} \\gamma k^2\n    $$\n    $$\n    N_c(k) = B k^2 + \\frac{2 \\mu_s}{k} + \\gamma\n    $$\n    The corresponding critical strain is $\\varepsilon_c(k) = N_c(k) / (E' t_f)$. We use the plane strain modulus $E' = E_f/(1-\\nu_f^2)$ and $B = E' t_f^3/12$:\n    $$\n    \\varepsilon_c(k) = \\frac{1}{E' t_f} \\left( B k^2 + \\frac{2 \\mu_s}{k} + \\gamma \\right) = \\frac{t_f^2}{12} k^2 + \\frac{2 \\mu_s}{E' t_f k} + \\frac{\\gamma}{E' t_f}\n    $$\n\n3.  **Bending-Dominated Scaling Law**\n\n    The expression for the critical strain $\\varepsilon_c(k)$ is a sum of three terms corresponding to bending resistance, substrate resistance, and surface energy resistance. The bending-dominated term is the one containing the bending stiffness $B$. The contribution to the critical strain from bending is:\n    $$\n    \\varepsilon_{c, \\text{bend}} = \\frac{t_f^2}{12} k^2\n    $$\n    The problem asks for this scaling law in terms of the wavelength $\\lambda = 2\\pi/k$. Substituting $k = 2\\pi/\\lambda$:\n    $$\n    \\varepsilon_{c, \\text{bend}} = \\frac{t_f^2}{12} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 t_f^2}{12 \\lambda^2} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{3} \\left(\\frac{t_f}{\\lambda}\\right)^2\n    $$\n    This expression has the form $\\varepsilon_c \\sim (t_f/\\lambda)^2$ with the explicit prefactor being $\\pi^2/3$. Thus, the scaling law is $\\varepsilon_c = \\frac{\\pi^2}{3} \\left(\\frac{t_f}{\\lambda}\\right)^2$.\n\n4.  **Optimal Wrinkle Wavelength**\n\n    The system will buckle at the wavelength that requires the minimum critical force. To find this preferred wavelength, we minimize $N_c(k)$ with respect to the wavenumber $k$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d N_c(k)}{dk} = \\frac{d}{dk} \\left( B k^2 + \\frac{2 \\mu_s}{k} + \\gamma \\right) = 2 B k - \\frac{2 \\mu_s}{k^2}\n    $$\n    Setting the derivative to zero to find the optimal wavenumber $k^*$:\n    $$\n    2 B k^* - \\frac{2 \\mu_s}{(k^*)^2} = 0 \\implies k^* = \\left(\\frac{\\mu_s}{B}\\right)^{1/3}\n    $$\n    The second derivative, $\\frac{d^2 N_c}{dk^2} = 2B + \\frac{4\\mu_s}{k^3}$, is positive for physical parameters ($B>0, \\mu_s>0$), confirming this is a minimum. The selected wavelength $\\lambda^*$ is given by $\\lambda^* = 2\\pi/k^*$:\n    $$\n    \\lambda^* = 2\\pi \\left(\\frac{B}{\\mu_s}\\right)^{1/3}\n    $$\n    Substituting the expression for the bending stiffness $B = \\frac{E_f t_f^3}{12(1-\\nu_f^2)}$:\n    $$\n    \\lambda^* = 2\\pi \\left(\\frac{E_f t_f^3}{12(1-\\nu_f^2) \\mu_s}\\right)^{1/3}\n    $$\n    Factoring out the film thickness $t_f$:\n    $$\n    \\lambda^* = 2\\pi t_f \\left(\\frac{E_f}{12(1-\\nu_f^2) \\mu_s}\\right)^{1/3}\n    $$\n    This is the closed-form expression for the optimal wavelength in terms of the specified material and geometric parameters.",
