            "problem": "A chemically enhanced material removal process in semiconductor manufacturing uses a dissolved oxidizer in a slurry to drive a first-order surface reaction on the wafer. Let the bulk oxidizer concentration be $C_b$, the surface concentration be $C_s$, the mass transfer coefficient be $k_m$, and the first-order surface reaction rate constant be $k_r$. The steady-state removal rate $R$ equals the interfacial reaction consumption rate. Assume a thin stagnant boundary layer adjacent to the wafer such that the diffusive flux from the bulk to the surface obeys Fick’s law in film form. Define the Damköhler number as $Da = k_r / k_m$. In patterned regions, hydrodynamics can alter the mass transfer coefficient; denote this generally as $k_m(\\phi)$, where $\\phi$ is the local pattern density, but treat $k_m(\\phi)$ symbolically without specifying a form.\n\nStarting only from the following fundamental bases:\n- Fick’s law of diffusion in a stagnant film relates the diffusive flux to the concentration drop across the film, with an effective mass transfer coefficient $k_m$ so that the flux is $J = k_m \\left(C_b - C_s\\right)$.\n- A first-order interfacial reaction consumes oxidizer with rate $R = k_r C_s$.\n- At steady state, the interfacial reaction rate equals the diffusive supply (flux continuity at the interface), so $R = J$.\n\nDerive an analytic expression for the removal rate $R$ as a function of $C_b$, $k_r$, and $k_m$.

This is a standard and fundamental model in chemical reaction engineering and is widely applied to processes like chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP) in semiconductor manufacturing.

It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Removal Rate, $R$**\n\nThe process is governed by three fundamental equations at steady state:\n1. The diffusive flux of the oxidizer from the bulk fluid to the wafer surface is given by Fick's law in film form:\n$$J = k_m(\\phi) (C_b - C_s)$$\n2. The consumption of the oxidizer at the surface is described by a first-order reaction:\n$$R = k_r C_s$$\n3. At steady state, the rate of supply (flux) must equal the rate of consumption (reaction):\n$$R = J$$\n\nThe objective is to find an expression for the removal rate $R$ as a function of the external parameters $C_b$, $k_r$, and $k_m(\\phi)$. This requires eliminating the internal variable, the surface concentration $C_s$.\n\nFrom the reaction rate equation, we can express $C_s$ in terms of $R$ and $k_r$:\n$$C_s = \\frac{R}{k_r}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $C_s$ into the flux equation:\n$$J = k_m(\\phi) \\left(C_b - \\frac{R}{k_r}\\right)$$\nUsing the steady-state condition $R = J$, we equate the expressions for $R$ and $J$:\n$$R = k_m(\\phi) \\left(C_b - \\frac{R}{k_r}\\right)$$\nWe now proceed to solve this equation for $R$ algebraically:\n$$R = k_m(\\phi) C_b - \\frac{k_m(\\phi)}{k_r} R$$\n$$R + \\frac{k_m(\\phi)}{k_r} R = k_m(\\phi) C_b$$\n$$R \\left(1 + \\frac{k_m(\\phi)}{k_r}\\right) = k_m(\\phi) C_b$$\n$$R \\left(\\frac{k_r + k_m(\\phi)}{k_r}\\right) = k_m(\\phi) C_b$$\n$$R = C_b \\frac{k_m(\\phi) k_r}{k_m(\\phi) + k_r}$$\nThis is the general expression for the removal rate $R$. It can also be written in the form $R = \\frac{C_b}{\\frac{1}{k_r} + \\frac{1}{k_m(\\phi)}}$, which highlights the analogy to electrical resistances in series, where the total resistance to the process is the sum of the reaction resistance and the transport resistance.\n\n**Calculation of the Change in Removal Rate, $\\Delta R$**\n\nThe problem asks for the change in removal rate, $\\Delta R$, when the bulk concentration is doubled from $C_b$ to $2 C_b$.\n$$\\Delta R = R(2 C_b) - R(C_b)$$\nUsing the derived expression for $R$:\n$$R(2 C_b) = (2 C_b) \\frac{k_m(\\phi) k_r}{k_m(\\phi) + k_r}$$\n$$R(C_b) = C_b \\frac{k_m(\\phi) k_r}{k_m(\\phi) + k_r}$$\nTherefore, the change $\\Delta R$ is:\n$$\\Delta R = (2 C_b) \\frac{k_m(\\phi) k_r}{k_m(\\phi) + k_r} - C_b \\frac{k_m(\\phi) k_r}{k_m(\\phi) + k_r} = C_b \\frac{k_m(\\phi) k_r}{k_m(\\phi) + k_r}$$\nNotably, for this first-order system, the change in rate upon doubling the concentration is exactly equal to the original rate, i.e., $\\Delta R = R(C_b)$.\n\n**Asymptotic Analysis of $\\Delta R$**\n\nWe now evaluate $\\Delta R$ in the two specified asymptotic regimes defined by the Damköhler number, $Da = k_r / k_m(\\phi)$.\n\n**1. Reaction-Limited Regime ($Da \\ll 1$)**\nThis limit corresponds to $Da = k_r / k_m(\\phi) \\ll 1$, which implies that the reaction rate constant is much smaller than the mass transfer coefficient, $k_r \\ll k_m(\\phi)$. The surface reaction is the slow, rate-determining step.\n\nIn the expression for $\\Delta R$:\n$$\\Delta R = C_b \\frac{k_m(\\phi) k_r}{k_m(\\phi) + k_r}$$\nIn the denominator, since $k_r \\ll k_m(\\phi)$, we can make the approximation $k_m(\\phi) + k_r \\approx k_m(\\phi)$.\nSubstituting this approximation into the expression for $\\Delta R$:\n$$\\Delta R \\approx C_b \\frac{k_m(\\phi) k_r}{k_m(\\phi)} = C_b k_r$$\nIn this reaction-limited regime, the change in removal rate $\\Delta R$ scales directly with the reaction rate constant $k_r$ and is independent of the mass transfer coefficient $k_m(\\phi)$. The dependence on pattern density $\\phi$ vanishes.\n\n**2. Transport-Limited Regime ($Da \\gg 1$)**\nThis limit corresponds to $Da = k_r / k_m(\\phi) \\gg 1$, which implies that the mass transfer coefficient is much smaller than the reaction rate constant, $k_m(\\phi) \\ll k_r$. Mass transport is the slow, rate-determining step.\n\nAgain, we start with the full expression for $\\Delta R$:\n$$\\Delta R = C_b \\frac{k_m(\\phi) k_r}{k_m(\\phi) + k_r}$$\nIn the denominator, since $k_m(\\phi) \\ll k_r$, we can make the approximation $k_m(\\phi) + k_r \\approx k_r$.\nSubstituting this approximation into the expression for $\\Delta R$:\n$$\\Delta R \\approx C_b \\frac{k_m(\\phi) k_r}{k_r} = C_b k_m(\\phi)$$\nIn this transport-limited regime, the change in removal rate $\\Delta R$ scales directly with the mass transfer coefficient $k_m(\\phi)$ and is independent of the reaction rate constant $k_r$. The rate change is now fully dependent on hydrodynamics and local pattern density $\\phi$ through the term $k_m(\\phi)$.\n\nThe final answer consists of these two limiting expressions for $\\Delta R$.",

To find $C_s$, we apply a quasi-steady-state approximation for the flux at the gas-surface interface. This means the flux of precursor from the bulk gas to the surface, $J_{trans}$, must equal the flux consumed by the reaction, $J_{rxn}$.\n\nThe transport flux is driven by the concentration difference between the bulk gas ($C_b$) and the near-surface region ($C_s$), governed by the mass transfer coefficient $k_g$:\n$$\nJ_{trans} = k_g (C_b - C_s)\n$$\nEquating the transport and reaction fluxes, $J_{trans} = J_{rxn}$:\n$$\nk_g (C_b - C_s) = k_s C_s (1 - \\theta) \\quad (2)\n$$\nWe can now solve this algebraic equation for $C_s$:\n$$\nk_g C_b - k_g C_s = k_s C_s (1 - \\theta)\n$$\n$$\nk_g C_b = C_s [k_g + k_s (1 - \\theta)]\n$$\n$$\nC_s = \\frac{k_g C_b}{k_g + k_s (1 - \\theta)} \\quad (3)\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $C_s$ back into the differential equation for $\\theta$ (Equation 1):\n$$\n\\Gamma_{\\max}\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = k_s \\left( \\frac{k_g C_b}{k_g + k_s (1 - \\theta)} \\right) (1 - \\theta)\n$$\n$$\n\\Gamma_{\\max}\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = \\frac{k_s k_g C_b (1 - \\theta)}{k_g + k_s (1 - \\theta)}\n$$\nThis is a separable first-order ordinary differential equation.

From the reaction rate equation, we express the surface concentration $C_s$ as $C_s = J / k_s(T_s)$. Substituting this into the mass transfer equation yields:\n$$ J = k_m \\left( C_b - \\frac{J}{k_s(T_s)} \\right) $$\nSolving for $J$:\n$$ J \\left( 1 + \\frac{k_m}{k_s(T_s)} \\right) = k_m C_b $$\n$$ J(T_s) = \\frac{k_m C_b}{1 + \\frac{k_m}{k_s(T_s)}} = \\frac{k_m k_s(T_s)}{k_m + k_s(T_s)} C_b $$\nThis equation gives the molar deposition flux as a function of the surface temperature $T_s$.\n\nNext, we establish the energy balance at the surface. At steady state, the heat generated by the exothermic reaction, $q_{\\text{gen}}$, must equal the heat removed from the surface, $q_{\\text{loss}}$. The heat generation flux is proportional to the molar deposition flux $J$:\n$$ q_{\\text{gen}} = \\Delta H_{\\text{rel}} J(T_s) $$\nwhere $\\Delta H_{\\text{rel}}$ is the heat released per mole of reactant. Heat is lost from the surface via two parallel paths: convection to the surrounding gas and conduction through the deposited film to the substrate.\n$$ q_{\\text{loss}} = h_g (T_s - T_b) + \\frac{k_f}{L_f} (T_s - T_{\\text{sub}}) $$\nHere, $h_g$ is the convective heat transfer coefficient, $T_b$ is the bulk gas temperature, $k_f$ is the thermal conductivity of the film, $L_f$ is the film thickness (conduction path length), and $T_{\\text{sub}}$ is the substrate temperature.\n\nBy equating heat generation and heat loss ($q_{\\text{gen}} = q_{\\text{loss}}$), we obtain a single, non-linear algebraic equation for the surface temperature $T_s$:\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\text{rel}} \\left( \\frac{k_m k_s(T_s)}{k_m + k_s(T_s)} \\right) C_b = h_g (T_s - T_b) + \\frac{k_f}{L_f} (T_s - T_{\\text{sub}}) $$\nSubstituting the Arrhenius expression for $k_s(T_s)$ gives the final form:\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\text{rel}} C_b \\frac{k_m k_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{R T_s}\\right)}{k_m + k_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{R T_s}\\right)} - \\left[ h_g (T_s - T_b) + \\frac{k_f}{L_f} (T_s - T_{\\text{sub}}) \\right] = 0 $$\nThis is a transcendental equation for $T_s$, which we solve numerically using a root-finding algorithm. The physical constraints of the problem suggest that a unique, stable solution for $T_s$ exists for the given parameters. We define a function $F(T_s)$ representing the left-hand side of this equation and seek the root where $F(T_s) = 0$.\n\nOnce the numerical value for $T_s$ is found, we can compute all other required quantities:\n1.  The surface temperature, $T_s$.\n2.  The deposition flux, $J$, using the derived expression for $J(T_s)$.\n3.  The Damköhler number, $Da(T_s) = \\dfrac{k_s(T_s)}{k_m}$, which compares the characteristic time for reaction to the characteristic time for mass transport.\n4.  The thermal Biot number, $Bi_T = \\dfrac{h_g L_f}{k_f}$, which compares the resistance to heat transfer by convection from the surface to the gas with the resistance to heat transfer by conduction through the film.\n5.  The process regime is classified based on the calculated $Da(T_s)$ value:\n    - Reaction-limited: $Da(T_s) \\le 0.1$ (code $1$)\n    - Mixed: $0.1 < Da(T_s) < 10$ (code $2$)\n    - Transport-limited: $Da(T_s) \\ge 10$ (code $0$)\n\nThis procedure is systematically applied to each set of parameters provided in the test suite.",
