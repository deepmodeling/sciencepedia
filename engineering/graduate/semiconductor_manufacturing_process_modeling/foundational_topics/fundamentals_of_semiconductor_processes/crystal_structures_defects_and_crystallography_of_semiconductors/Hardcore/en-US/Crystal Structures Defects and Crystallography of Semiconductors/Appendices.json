It is scientifically sound, well-posed, completely defined, and objective. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is developed in three stages: first, the determination of the reciprocal lattice primitive vectors; second, the derivation of the analytical expressions for $|\\mathbf{G}_{(2,0,0)}|$ and $d_{200}$; and third, the numerical evaluation of these quantities.\n\nThe direct lattice primitive vectors for the simple cubic structure are given as:\n$$ \\mathbf{a}_{1} = a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} $$\n$$ \\mathbf{a}_{2} = a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} $$\n$$ \\mathbf{a}_{3} = a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} $$\nThe volume of the direct lattice primitive cell, $V$, is given by the scalar triple product of these vectors:\n$$ V = \\mathbf{a}_{1} \\cdot (\\mathbf{a}_{2} \\times \\mathbf{a}_{3}) = (a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}) \\cdot ((a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) \\times (a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}})) = (a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}) \\cdot (a^{2} (\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{z}})) = (a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}) \\cdot (a^{2} \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}) = a^{3} $$\nThe reciprocal lattice vectors $\\mathbf{b}_{j}$ are defined by the condition $\\mathbf{a}_{i} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_{j} = 2\\pi\\,\\delta_{ij}$. The general solution for these vectors is:\n$$ \\mathbf{b}_{1} = \\frac{2\\pi}{V} (\\mathbf{a}_{2} \\times \\mathbf{a}_{3}) $$\n$$ \\mathbf{b}_{2} = \\frac{2\\pi}{V} (\\mathbf{a}_{3} \\times \\mathbf{a}_{1}) $$\n$$ \\mathbf{b}_{3} = \\frac{2\\pi}{V} (\\mathbf{a}_{1} \\times \\mathbf{a}_{2}) $$\nSubstituting the given vectors and the calculated volume:\n$$ \\mathbf{b}_{1} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a^{3}} (a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\times a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) = \\frac{2\\pi a^{2}}{a^{3}} (\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) = \\frac{2\\pi}{a} \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} $$\n$$ \\mathbf{b}_{2} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a^{3}} (a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\times a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}) = \\frac{2\\pi a^{2}}{a^{3}} (\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}) = \\frac{2\\pi}{a} \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} $$\n$$ \\mathbf{b}_{3} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a^{3}} (a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} \\times a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) = \\frac{2\\pi a^{2}}{a^{3}} (\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) = \\frac{2\\pi}{a} \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} $$\nThese are the primitive vectors of the reciprocal lattice, which is also a simple cubic lattice with a lattice parameter of $\\frac{2\\pi}{a}$.\n\nNow, we can find the reciprocal lattice vector $\\mathbf{G}_{(hkl)}$ for the Miller indices $(h,k,l)=(2,0,0)$. Using the given definition $\\mathbf{G}_{(hkl)}=h\\,\\mathbf{b}_{1}+k\\,\\mathbf{b}_{2}+l\\,\\mathbf{b}_{3}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{G}_{(2,0,0)} = 2\\,\\mathbf{b}_{1} + 0\\,\\mathbf{b}_{2} + 0\\,\\mathbf{b}_{3} = 2\\,\\mathbf{b}_{1} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\mathbf{b}_{1}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{G}_{(2,0,0)} = 2 \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{a} \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} \\right) = \\frac{4\\pi}{a} \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} $$\nThe magnitude of this vector, $|\\mathbf{G}_{(2,0,0)}|$, is:\n$$ |\\mathbf{G}_{(2,0,0)}| = \\left| \\frac{4\\pi}{a} \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} \\right| = \\frac{4\\pi}{a} $$\n\nNext, we derive the interplanar spacing $d_{200}$ for the $(200)$ family of planes. The geometric interpretation of Miller indices $(hkl)$ is that they define a set of parallel planes, where the first plane from the origin intercepts the crystallographic axes at $\\frac{a}{h}$, $\\frac{a}{k}$, and $\\frac{a}{l}$ (for a cubic system).\nFor the $(200)$ planes, the intercepts are:\n- x-intercept: $\\frac{a}{h} = \\frac{a}{2}$\n- y-intercept: $\\frac{a}{k} = \\frac{a}{0} \\to \\infty$\n- z-intercept: $\\frac{a}{l} = \\frac{a}{0} \\to \\infty$\nA plane with an intercept at $\\frac{a}{2}$ on the x-axis and parallel to the y and z axes is described by the equation $x=\\frac{a}{2}$. The family of $(200)$ planes is a set of such planes. The origin $(0,0,0)$ lies on the plane $x=0$. The next plane in the family is at $x=\\frac{a}{2}$. The distance between these two adjacent planes is the interplanar spacing $d_{200}$.\n$$ d_{200} = \\frac{a}{2} - 0 = \\frac{a}{2} $$\n\nWith the analytical expressions derived, we can now perform the numerical evaluation using the given lattice parameter $a=0.565\\ \\text{nm}$.\n\nFirst, the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector:\n$$ |\\mathbf{G}_{(2,0,0)}| = \\frac{4\\pi}{a} = \\frac{4\\pi}{0.565\\ \\text{nm}} \\approx 22.24136\\ \\text{nm}^{-1} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ |\\mathbf{G}_{(2,0,0)}| \\approx 22.24\\ \\text{nm}^{-1} $$\n\nSecond, the interplanar spacing:\n$$ d_{200} = \\frac{a}{2} = \\frac{0.565\\ \\text{nm}}{2} = 0.2825\\ \\text{nm} $$\nThis result is already at four significant figures.\n\nThe final numerical values are $22.24\\ \\text{nm}^{-1}$ for $|\\mathbf{G}_{(2,0,0)}|$ and $0.2825\\ \\text{nm}$ for $d_{200}$.",

It presents a standard, albeit nuanced, exercise in dislocation characterization that is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe determination of the Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}$ of a dislocation from TEM images relies on the invisibility criteria under two-beam diffraction conditions.\n\n**1. Principles of Dislocation Contrast**\n\nIn kinematical theory, the contrast from a dislocation arises from the displacement field $\\mathbf{R}$ around the dislocation line. A dislocation is invisible, or shows minimum contrast, when the atomic displacements $\\mathbf{R}$ are parallel to the diffracting planes corresponding to the reciprocal lattice vector $\\mathbf{g}$. This condition is expressed as $\\mathbf{g} \\cdot \\mathbf{R} = 0$.\n\nFor a general dislocation with line direction $\\mathbf{u}$ and Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}$:\n*   For a pure screw dislocation ($\\mathbf{b} \\parallel \\mathbf{u}$), the displacement field is parallel to $\\mathbf{b}$. The invisibility criterion is strictly $\\mathbf{g} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = 0$.\n*   For a pure edge dislocation ($\\mathbf{b} \\perp \\mathbf{u}$) and mixed dislocations, the displacement field is more complex. The primary condition for invisibility is still approximated as $\\mathbf{g} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = 0$. However, even when $\\mathbf{g} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = 0$, some \"residual\" contrast can remain if the component of the displacement field perpendicular to $\\mathbf{b}$ is not orthogonal to $\\mathbf{g}$. Complete invisibility for a dislocation of any character requires that the conditions $\\mathbf{g} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = 0$ and, for edge or mixed components, $\\mathbf{g} \\cdot (\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{u}) = 0$ are both satisfied.\n\nWe are given that the dislocation is invisible for $\\mathbf{g} = [004]$. This is the most stringent condition and provides the starting point for our analysis.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Invisibility Condition**\n\nThe observation of complete invisibility for $\\mathbf{g}_{inv} = [004]$ implies that both criteria for invisibility are met. Let the Burgers vector be $\\mathbf{b} = (\\frac{a}{N})[hkl]$, where $N$ and $h,k,l$ are integers.\n\n*   **First criterion:** $\\mathbf{g}_{inv} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = 0$.\n    $$[004] \\cdot \\left(\\frac{a}{N}\\right)[hkl] = \\frac{a}{N} (0 \\cdot h + 0 \\cdot k + 4 \\cdot l) = \\frac{4al}{N} = 0$$\n    This requires that $l=0$. Therefore, the Burgers vector must lie in the $(001)$ plane, having the form $\\mathbf{b} = (\\frac{a}{N})[hk0]$.\n\n*   **Second criterion:** $\\mathbf{g}_{inv} \\cdot (\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{u}) = 0$.\n    The line direction is given as $\\mathbf{u} \\parallel [001]$. Since $\\mathbf{b}$ has the form $[hk0]$, the dislocation is of pure edge character because $\\mathbf{b} \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = [hk0] \\cdot [001] = 0$.\n    Let's compute the cross product:\n    $$\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{u} = \\left(\\frac{a}{N}\\right)[hk0] \\times [001] = \\left(\\frac{a}{N}\\right) [k, -h, 0]$$\n    Now, we check the dot product with $\\mathbf{g}_{inv}$:\n    $$\\mathbf{g}_{inv} \\cdot (\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{u}) = [004] \\cdot \\left(\\frac{a}{N}\\right)[k, -h, 0] = \\frac{a}{N}(0 \\cdot k + 0 \\cdot (-h) + 4 \\cdot 0) = 0$$\n    This condition is automatically satisfied for any vector $\\mathbf{b}$ in the $(001)$ plane when $\\mathbf{g}=[004]$.\n\nThus, the invisibility for $\\mathbf{g} = [004]$ definitively proves that the Burgers vector has no component in the $[001]$ direction, i.e., it is of the form $[hk0]$.\n\n**3. Evaluation of Candidate Burgers Vectors**\n\nWe can now evaluate the given options based on the condition that $l=0$.\n\n*   A. $\\mathbf{b} = \\dfrac{a}{2}[110]$: Here, $l=0$. This is a possible candidate.\n*   B. $\\mathbf{b} = \\dfrac{a}{6}[112]$: Here, $l=2 \\neq 0$. This is inconsistent with the invisibility at $\\mathbf{g}=[004]$. This option is **incorrect**.\n*   C. $\\mathbf{b} = \\dfrac{a}{3}[111]$: Here, $l=1 \\neq 0$. This is also inconsistent with the invisibility at $\\mathbf{g}=[004]$. This option is **incorrect**.\n*   D. $\\mathbf{b} = \\dfrac{a}{6}[110]$: Here, $l=0$. This is a possible candidate.\n\nThe analysis has narrowed the possibilities to options A and D. Both have a Burgers vector direction of $[110]$.\n\n**4. Analysis of the Contrast Conditions**\n\nNow we must test the candidate direction $\\mathbf{b} \\propto [110]$ against the two \"strong contrast\" observations. The dislocation is a pure edge type with $\\mathbf{u}=[001]$ and $\\mathbf{b} \\propto [110]$.\n\n*   **Condition for $\\mathbf{g}_1 = [220]$ (strong contrast):**\n    $$\\mathbf{g}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{b} \\propto [220] \\cdot [110] = 2 \\cdot 1 + 2 \\cdot 1 + 0 \\cdot 0 = 4$$\n    Since $\\mathbf{g}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{b} \\neq 0$, strong contrast is expected. This is consistent with the observation.\n\n*   **Condition for $\\mathbf{g}_2 = [\\overline{2}20]$ (strong contrast):**\n    $$\\mathbf{g}_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{b} \\propto [\\overline{2}20] \\cdot [110] = (-2) \\cdot 1 + 2 \\cdot 1 + 0 \\cdot 0 = 0$$\n    Since $\\mathbf{g}_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = 0$, the simple criterion predicts invisibility. However, for an edge dislocation, we must check the residual contrast term $\\mathbf{g} \\cdot (\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{u})$.\n    We have $\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{u} \\propto [110] \\times [001] = [1\\overline{1}0]$.\n    $$\\mathbf{g}_2 \\cdot (\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{u}) \\propto [\\overline{2}20] \\cdot [1\\overline{1}0] = (-2) \\cdot 1 + 2 \\cdot (-1) + 0 \\cdot 0 = -4$$\n    Since $\\mathbf{g}_2 \\cdot (\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{u}) \\neq 0$, there will be residual contrast. In many practical cases, this residual contrast for an edge dislocation is significant and may be described as \"strong\" in comparison to the complete invisibility observed under other conditions. Therefore, we interpret the observation of \"strong contrast\" as being consistent with this situation.\n\nBoth remaining options (A and D) have a Burgers vector parallel to $[110]$ and are therefore consistent with all three experimental observations, under the standard interpretation of TEM contrast rules including residual contrast.\n\n**5. Distinguishing Between Perfect and Partial Dislocations**\n\nTo choose between option A and D, we must consider the physical nature of the dislocations.\n*   Option A: $\\mathbf{b} = \\dfrac{a}{2}[110]$ is a perfect dislocation. These are the fundamental dislocations in the crystal lattice and can exist as stable, isolated line defects. A threading dislocation in an epitaxial film is very commonly a perfect dislocation.\n*   Option D: $\\mathbf{b} = \\dfrac{a}{6}[110]$ is a stair-rod partial dislocation. Partial dislocations cannot exist in isolation within a perfect crystal; they must bound a stacking fault. A stair-rod dislocation, in particular, is sessile and forms at the intersection of two stacking faults on different $\\{111\\}$ planes (e.g., as part of a Lomer-Cottrell lock). The problem describes a single \"straight dislocation segment thread\" and makes no mention of any associated stacking faults, which would produce their own distinct contrast.\n\nGiven the description of the defect as a single, isolated thread, it is far more plausible that it is a stable perfect dislocation rather than a partial dislocation that must be part of a more complex defect structure. Therefore, the perfect dislocation is the most consistent and physically reasonable interpretation.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A. $\\mathbf{b} = \\dfrac{a}{2}[110]$, a perfect dislocation.**\n    This candidate is consistent with the invisibility condition for $\\mathbf{g}=[004]$ (since $l=0$). It is consistent with strong contrast for $\\mathbf{g}=[220]$ (since $\\mathbf{g} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} \\neq 0$). It is consistent with the observation of strong contrast for $\\mathbf{g}=[\\overline{2}20]$ if one accepts that the significant residual contrast for an edge dislocation (where $\\mathbf{g} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = 0$ but $\\mathbf{g} \\cdot (\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{u}) \\neq 0$) is being described as \"strong\". As a perfect dislocation, it is a physically plausible candidate for an isolated threading dislocation. This is the most consistent option.\n    **Verdict: Correct**\n\n*   **B. $\\mathbf{b} = \\dfrac{a}{6}[112]$, a Shockley partial on a $\\{111\\}$ slip plane.**\n    The Burgers vector has a non-zero $l$ component ($l=2$). Therefore, $\\mathbf{g} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = [004] \\cdot \\frac{a}{6}[112] = \\frac{4a}{3} \\neq 0$. This would produce strong contrast for $\\mathbf{g}=[004]$, directly contradicting the observation of invisibility.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n*   **C. $\\mathbf{b} = \\dfrac{a}{3}[111]$, a Frank partial normal to a $\\{111\\}$ plane.**\n    The Burgers vector has a non-zero $l$ component ($l=1$). Therefore, $\\mathbf{g} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = [004] \\cdot \\frac{a}{3}[111] = \\frac{4a}{3} \\neq 0$. This would produce strong contrast for $\\mathbf{g}=[004]$, directly contradicting the observation of invisibility.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n*   **D. $\\mathbf{b} = \\dfrac{a}{6}[110]$, a sessile stair-rod partial.**\n    This candidate's direction is consistent with all three contrast observations, just as option A is. However, a stair-rod is a partial dislocation and is physically expected to be part of a larger defect assembly involving stacking faults. The description of a single threading dislocation makes this a less probable identification than a perfect dislocation.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect**",

The problem states the dislocation lies in a $\\{111\\}$ plane. This requires both the line direction and the Burgers vector to lie in this plane.\n1.  Let the line direction vector be $\\mathbf{d_t} = [1, -1, 0]$ and the Burgers vector direction be $\\mathbf{d_b} = [1, 0, -1]$.\n2.  We test which plane of the $\\{111\\}$ family contains both direction vectors. A direction $[u\\,v\\,w]$ lies in a plane $(h\\,k\\,l)$ if the dot product $hu+kv+lw=0$.\n3.  For the plane $(111)$:\n    -   $\\mathbf{d_t} \\cdot (111) = (1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (0)(1) = 0$. The line lies in the $(111)$ plane.\n    -   $\\mathbf{d_b} \\cdot (111) = (1)(1) + (0)(1) + (-1)(1) = 0$. The Burgers vector lies in the $(111)$ plane.\n    Both vectors lie in the $(111)$ plane. It can be verified that the $(111)$ plane is the only member of the $\\{111\\}$ family that contains both specified directions.\n4.  Let us check the angle $\\theta$ between the line vector and the Burgers vector:\n    $$ \\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\mathbf{d_t} \\cdot \\mathbf{d_b}}{|\\mathbf{d_t}| |\\mathbf{d_b}|} = \\frac{(1)(1) + (-1)(0) + (0)(-1)}{\\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2 + 0^2} \\sqrt{1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n    This gives $\\theta = \\arccos(1/2) = 60^{\\circ}$, which matches the problem description of a \"$60^{\\circ}$ mixed dislocation\".\n\nThe problem is well-posed, objective, internally consistent, and scientifically sound. All necessary parameters are provided.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe force per unit length, $\\mathbf{f}$, on a dislocation line is given by the Peach-Koehler formula:\n$$ \\mathbf{f} = (\\mathbf{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}) \\times \\mathbf{t} $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{\\sigma}$ is the stress tensor, $\\mathbf{b}$ is the Burgers vector, and $\\mathbf{t}$ is the unit vector tangent to the dislocation line.\n\nWe establish a Cartesian coordinate system $(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}, \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}, \\hat{\\mathbf{z}})$ such that $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} \\parallel [100]$, $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\parallel [010]$, and $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\parallel [001]$.\n\nThe Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}$ is given as $\\frac{a}{2}[1\\,0\\,-1]$. In our coordinate system, this is:\n$$ \\mathbf{b} = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} - \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) $$\n\nThe dislocation line is parallel to $[1\\,-1\\,0]$. The unit vector $\\mathbf{t}$ along this direction is:\n$$ \\mathbf{t} = \\frac{\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} - \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}}{\\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2 + 0^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} - \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) $$\n\nThe applied stress is uniaxial with magnitude $\\sigma_0$ along the $[110]$ direction. The unit vector in this direction, $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}$, is:\n$$ \\hat{\\mathbf{n}} = \\frac{\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}}{\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 0^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) $$\nThe stress tensor $\\mathbf{\\sigma}$ for such a uniaxial stress is given by $\\sigma_{ij} = \\sigma_0 n_i n_j$, or $\\mathbf{\\sigma} = \\sigma_0 \\hat{\\mathbf{n}} \\otimes \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}$. In matrix form:\n$$ \\mathbf{\\sigma} = \\sigma_0 \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the vector $\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{v} = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\frac{a}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{\\sigma_0 a}{4} \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(1) + (1)(0) + (0)(-1) \\\\ (1)(1) + (1)(0) + (0)(-1) \\\\ (0)(1) + (0)(0) + (0)(-1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\sigma_0 a}{4} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nIn vector notation, $\\mathbf{v} = \\frac{\\sigma_0 a}{4}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{y}})$.\n\nNow we compute the cross product $\\mathbf{f} = \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{t}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{f} = \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_0 a}{4} (\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} - \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) \\right) = \\frac{\\sigma_0 a}{4\\sqrt{2}} (\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) \\times (\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} - \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) $$\nThe cross product expands as:\n$$ (\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) \\times (\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} - \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) = (\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}) - (\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) + (\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}) - (\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) $$\nUsing $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} = \\mathbf{0}$, $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} = \\mathbf{0}$, $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} = \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, and $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} = -\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, we get:\n$$ \\mathbf{0} - \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} - \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} - \\mathbf{0} = -2\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\mathbf{f}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{f} = \\frac{\\sigma_0 a}{4\\sqrt{2}} (-2\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) = -\\frac{\\sigma_0 a}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} = -\\frac{\\sigma_0 a \\sqrt{2}}{4} \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the magnitude of this force per unit length, $|\\mathbf{f}|$:\n$$ |\\mathbf{f}| = \\left| -\\frac{\\sigma_0 a \\sqrt{2}}{4} \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\right| = \\frac{\\sigma_0 a \\sqrt{2}}{4} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$\\sigma_{0} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{GPa} = 1.2 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{N/m^2}$\n$a = 5.431\\,\\mathrm{\\AA} = 5.431 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n\n$$ |\\mathbf{f}| = \\frac{(1.2 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{N/m^2})(5.431 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m}) \\sqrt{2}}{4} $$\n$$ |\\mathbf{f}| = \\frac{1.2 \\times 5.431 \\times \\sqrt{2}}{4} \\times 10^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{N/m} $$\n$$ |\\mathbf{f}| = (0.3 \\times 5.431 \\times \\sqrt{2}) \\times 10^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{N/m} $$\n$$ |\\mathbf{f}| \\approx (1.6293 \\times 1.41421) \\times 10^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{N/m} $$\n$$ |\\mathbf{f}| \\approx 2.30416 \\times 10^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{N/m} $$\n$$ |\\mathbf{f}| \\approx 0.230416\\,\\mathrm{N/m} $$\n\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get $0.230\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$.",
