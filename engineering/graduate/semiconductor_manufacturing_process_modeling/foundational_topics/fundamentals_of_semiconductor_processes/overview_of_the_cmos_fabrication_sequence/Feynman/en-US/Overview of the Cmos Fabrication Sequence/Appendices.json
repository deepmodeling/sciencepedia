            "problem": "A key front-end-of-line step in Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication is thermal oxidation of silicon to form silicon dioxide. Consider the growth of an oxide film of thickness $x(t)$ under a single oxidant species with one-dimensional transport through the oxide and reaction at the silicon interface. Assume steady-state diffusion through the oxide of thickness $x(t)$ with constant diffusivity, a first-order interfacial reaction, and a gas-oxide boundary that maintains a constant oxidant concentration in the oxide at the surface. Let $A$ denote the effective linear rate parameter and $B$ denote the effective parabolic rate parameter that emerge from this reaction-diffusion system.

All premises are scientifically sound and represent a standard, formalizable problem in semiconductor process modeling. The provided data are physically realistic for the specified conditions. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary parameters and conditions provided for a unique solution. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or logical-scientific flaws.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. The solution will now be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Growth Law\nThe growth of the silicon dioxide layer is governed by a reaction-diffusion process. Let $y$ be the spatial coordinate perpendicular to the silicon surface, with $y=0$ at the gas-oxide interface and $y=x(t)$ at the moving Si-SiO$_2$ interface. Let $C(y)$ be the concentration of the oxidant species within the oxide layer.\n\n1.  **Diffusion Flux**: According to Fick's first law, the flux $J_1$ of the oxidant diffusing through the existing oxide layer is given by:\n    $$J_1 = -D \\frac{dC}{dy}$$\n    where $D$ is the diffusivity of the oxidant in SiO$_2$. Under the steady-state assumption, the flux is constant throughout the oxide, which implies a linear concentration gradient. We can integrate from the surface ($y=0$) to the interface ($y=x(t)$):\n    $$J_1 \\int_0^x dy = -D \\int_{C_s}^{C_i} dC$$\n    Here, $C_s$ is the constant oxidant concentration at the gas-oxide surface and $C_i$ is the concentration at the Si-SiO$_2$ interface. The problem states that the gas-oxide boundary maintains a constant oxidant concentration in the oxide surface, which is related to the partial pressure of the oxidant in the gas via Henry's law. Let this constant surface concentration be $C^*$. So, $C_s = C^*$. The integration yields:\n    $$J_1 x = -D(C_i - C^*)$$\n    $$J_1 = \\frac{D(C^* - C_i)}{x}$$\n\n2.  **Reaction Flux**: The problem specifies a first-order interfacial reaction. The flux of oxidant consumed by the reaction at the Si-SiO$_2$ interface, $J_2$, is proportional to the oxidant concentration at the interface:\n    $$J_2 = k_s C_i$$\n    where $k_s$ is the interfacial reaction rate constant.\n\n3.  **Steady-State Condition**: In steady state, the diffusion flux must equal the reaction flux, $J_1 = J_2 = J$.\n    $$\\frac{D(C^* - C_i)}{x} = k_s C_i$$\n    We solve for the unknown interfacial concentration $C_i$:\n    $$DC^* - DC_i = k_s x C_i \\implies DC^* = (D + k_s x)C_i$$\n    $$C_i = \\frac{DC^*}{D+k_s x} = \\frac{C^*}{1 + (k_s/D)x}$$\n    Substituting this back into the expression for the flux $J$:\n    $$J = k_s C_i = \\frac{k_s C^*}{1 + (k_s/D)x}$$\n\n4.  **Oxide Growth Rate**: The rate of increase of the oxide thickness, $\\frac{dx}{dt}$, is proportional to the flux of oxidant arriving at the interface. Let $N_1$ be the number of oxidant molecules required to form a unit volume of SiO$_2$. Then, by mass conservation at the interface:\n    $$N_1 \\frac{dx}{dt} = J = \\frac{k_s C^*}{1 + (k_s/D)x}$$\n    $$\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{k_s C^*/N_1}{1 + (k_s/D)x}$$\n    This is the differential equation for oxide growth. To obtain the desired form, we separate variables and integrate:\n    $$\\left(1 + \\frac{k_s}{D}x\\right) dx = \\frac{k_s C^*}{N_1} dt$$\n    We integrate from $t=0$ (where $x=0$, as per the problem statement) to a time $t$ (where the thickness is $x(t)$):\n    $$\\int_0^x \\left(1 + \\frac{k_s}{D}x'\\right) dx' = \\int_0^t \\frac{k_s C^*}{N_1} dt'$$\n    $$x + \\frac{k_s}{2D}x^2 = \\left(\\frac{k_s C^*}{N_1}\\right)t$$\n    To align with the conventional form of the Deal-Grove model, we multiply the entire equation by $2D/k_s$:\n    $$\\frac{2D}{k_s}x + x^2 = \\left(\\frac{2DC^*}{N_1}\\right)t$$\n    This is the general form $x^2 + Ax = Bt$, where the linear rate parameter $A$ and the parabolic rate parameter $B$ are defined as:\n    $$A = \\frac{2D}{k_s} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad B = \\frac{2DC^*}{N_1}$$\n    The derived growth law is the quadratic relation $x^2(t) + Ax(t) = Bt$.\n\n### Calculation of Growth Time\nFrom the derived growth law, we can find the time $t(x_f)$ required to grow an oxide of a specific final thickness $x_f$:\n$$x_f^2 + A x_f = B t(x_f)$$\nSolving for $t(x_f)$:\n$$t(x_f) = \\frac{x_f^2 + A x_f}{B} = \\frac{x_f^2}{B} + \\frac{A}{B}x_f$$\nThis is the required expression. Now we compute the numerical values.\n\nFirst, we must ensure consistent units.

The CMP sequence consists of two sub-steps: a copper removal step to clear the overburden until the barrier is exposed, and a barrier removal step to remove the tantalum or tantalum nitride barrier and stop on the dielectric. In modeling CMP removal, assume the Preston relation holds: the material removal rate is proportional to the product of applied pressure and relative velocity, with a material-dependent Preston coefficient. Dishing is the recession of copper within a cleared trench due to continued polishing during overpolish time; model dishing in cleared regions by assuming that once the barrier is exposed locally, copper exists only in trenches and its local removal rate becomes the area-density-scaled rate, proportional to the copper area fraction within the pattern.\n\nConsider the following scientifically consistent process parameters for the copper overburden removal (first CMP sub-step) on a Back End of Line (BEOL) level:\n- Applied pressure $P = 30~\\mathrm{kPa}$ and relative pad-wafer velocity $V = 0.35~\\mathrm{m/s}$ during the copper CMP step.\n- Copper Preston coefficient $k_{\\mathrm{Cu}} = 15~\\mathrm{nm}/(\\mathrm{min}\\cdot\\mathrm{kPa}\\cdot\\mathrm{m/s})$.

We model this as $RR_{\\mathrm{dish}} = \\phi \\cdot RR_{\\mathrm{Cu}}$.\nThe copper area fraction is:\n$$\\phi = \\frac{w}{p} = \\frac{0.20~\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{1.00~\\mu\\mathrm{m}} = 0.2$$\nSo, the dishing rate is:\n$$RR_{\\mathrm{dish}} = \\phi \\cdot RR_{\\mathrm{Cu}} = 0.2 \\cdot (2.625~\\mathrm{nm/s}) = 0.525~\\mathrm{nm/s}$$\nThe total dishing, $D$, is the dishing rate integrated over the overpolish time:\n$$D = RR_{\\mathrm{dish}} \\cdot t_{\\mathrm{overpolish}} = (\\phi \\cdot RR_{\\mathrm{Cu}}) \\cdot (t_{\\mathrm{total}} - t_{\\mathrm{clear\\_min}})$$\nThis dishing must not exceed the specification $D_{\\mathrm{spec}}$:\n$$(\\phi \\cdot RR_{\\mathrm{Cu}}) \\cdot (t_{\\mathrm{total}} - t_{\\mathrm{clear\\_min}}) \\le D_{\\mathrm{spec}}$$\nThis inequality gives an upper bound on the total process time:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{total}} \\le t_{\\mathrm{clear\\_min}} + \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{spec}}}{\\phi \\cdot RR_{\\mathrm{Cu}}}$$\nCombining the two constraints on $t_{\\mathrm{total}}$, we define the allowed process window:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{clear\\_max}} \\le t_{\\mathrm{total}} \\le t_{\\mathrm{clear\\_min}} + \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{spec}}}{\\phi \\cdot RR_{\\mathrm{Cu}}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the clearing times:\n$$\\frac{T_{\\max}}{RR_{\\mathrm{Cu}}} \\le t_{\\mathrm{total}} \\le \\frac{T_{\\min}}{RR_{\\mathrm{Cu}}} + \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{spec}}}{\\phi \\cdot RR_{\\mathrm{Cu}}}$$\nA valid process window exists only if the lower bound is less than or equal to the upper bound:\n$$\\frac{T_{\\max}}{RR_{\\mathrm{Cu}}} \\le \\frac{T_{\\min}}{RR_{\\mathrm{Cu}}} + \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{spec}}}{\\phi \\cdot RR_{\\mathrm{Cu}}}$$\nMultiplying by $RR_{\\mathrm{Cu}}$ (a positive quantity) preserves the inequality:\n$$T_{\\max} \\le T_{\\min} + \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{spec}}}{\\phi}$$\n$$T_{\\max} - T_{\\min} \\le \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{spec}}}{\\phi}$$\nLet's verify this condition with the given values, converting all to nanometers:\n$T_{\\min} = 0.75~\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 750~\\mathrm{nm}$\n$T_{\\max} = 0.85~\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 850~\\mathrm{nm}$\n$D_{\\mathrm{spec}} = 0.020~\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 20~\\mathrm{nm}$\n$\\phi = 0.2$\n$$850~\\mathrm{nm} - 750~\\mathrm{nm} \\le \\frac{20~\\mathrm{nm}}{0.2}$$\n$$100~\\mathrm{nm} \\le 100~\\mathrm{nm}$$\nThe condition is met exactly as an equality. This signifies that the process window has collapsed to a single point in time. The only time $t_{\\mathrm{total}}$ that satisfies both constraints is the one where both inequalities become equalities. Therefore, the required process time is exactly the minimum time needed to clear the thickest region of copper:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{total}} = t_{\\mathrm{clear\\_max}} = \\frac{T_{\\max}}{RR_{\\mathrm{Cu}}}$$\nWe can now calculate this time:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\frac{850~\\mathrm{nm}}{2.625~\\mathrm{nm/s}} = \\frac{850}{21/8}~\\mathrm{s} = \\frac{6800}{21}~\\mathrm{s} \\approx 323.8095~\\mathrm{s}$$\nThe problem requests the answer in seconds, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$t_{\\mathrm{total}} \\approx 323.8~\\mathrm{s}$$\nThis time ensures that the thickest overburden ($850~\\mathrm{nm}$) is just cleared, and at this exact moment, the dishing in the earliest-cleared region reaches its maximum allowed value ($20~\\mathrm{nm}$).",
