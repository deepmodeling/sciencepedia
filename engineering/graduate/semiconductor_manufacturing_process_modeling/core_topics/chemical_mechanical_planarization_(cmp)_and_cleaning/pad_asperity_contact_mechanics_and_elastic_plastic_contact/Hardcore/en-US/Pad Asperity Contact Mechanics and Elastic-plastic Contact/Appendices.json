We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to first derive an expression for the incremental normal stiffness, $k_n$, then evaluate it numerically, and finally provide a physical interpretation.\n\n**1. Derivation of Incremental Normal Stiffness ($k_n$)**\n\nThe incremental normal stiffness is defined as the derivative of the normal load $W$ with respect to the normal indentation $\\delta$:\n$$\nk_n = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}W}{\\mathrm{d}\\delta}\n$$\nWe are given the Hertzian relation for the normal load as a function of indentation:\n$$\nW(\\delta) = \\frac{4}{3} E^{*} R^{1/2} \\delta^{3/2}\n$$\nwhere $E^{*}$ is the effective modulus and $R$ is the asperity radius. Differentiating this expression with respect to $\\delta$ yields the stiffness:\n$$\nk_n = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\delta} \\left( \\frac{4}{3} E^{*} R^{1/2} \\delta^{3/2} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nk_n = \\frac{4}{3} E^{*} R^{1/2} \\left( \\frac{3}{2} \\delta^{1/2} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nk_n = 2 E^{*} R^{1/2} \\delta^{1/2}\n$$\nThis expression gives $k_n$ in terms of material properties ($E^*$) and geometric parameters ($R, \\delta$). To express it in terms of the contact radius $a$, we use the second given Hertzian relation:\n$$\na(\\delta) = \\sqrt{R \\delta}\n$$\nFrom this, we can write $\\delta^{1/2} = \\frac{a}{R^{1/2}}$. Substituting this into the expression for $k_n$:\n$$\nk_n = 2 E^{*} R^{1/2} \\left( \\frac{a}{R^{1/2}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nk_n = 2 E^{*} a\n$$\nThis is a simple and elegant expression for the normal stiffness, relating it directly to the effective modulus and the contact radius.\n\n**2. Numerical Evaluation of $k_n$**\n\nTo evaluate $k_n$ numerically, we can use the derived relation $k_n = (6 W R (E^{*})^{2})^{1/3}$, which we can derive from the previous expressions to avoid calculating $\\delta$ and $a$ as intermediate steps. From $k_n = 2 E^{*} R^{1/2} \\delta^{1/2}$, we have $k_n^3 = 8 (E^{*})^3 R^{3/2} \\delta^{3/2}$. From $W = \\frac{4}{3} E^{*} R^{1/2} \\delta^{3/2}$, we have $\\delta^{3/2} = \\frac{3W}{4 E^{*} R^{1/2}}$. Substituting $\\delta^{3/2}$ into the expression for $k_n^3$:\n$$\nk_n^3 = 8 (E^{*})^3 R^{3/2} \\left(\\frac{3W}{4 E^{*} R^{1/2}}\\right) = 6 (E^{*})^2 R W\n$$\nThus,\n$$\nk_n = \\left( 6 W R (E^{*})^{2} \\right)^{1/3}\n$$\nThis form is computationally convenient. The first step is to calculate the effective modulus $E^{*}$.\n\n**2a. Calculation of Effective Modulus ($E^{*}$)**\n\nThe effective modulus $E^{*}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{E^{*}} = \\frac{1 - \\nu_{1}^{2}}{E_{1}} + \\frac{1 - \\nu_{2}^{2}}{E_{2}}\n$$\nUsing the provided data:\n- Pad (material 1): $E_{1} = 1.00 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, $\\nu_{1} = 0.45$.\n- Wafer (material 2): $E_{2} = 1.69 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, $\\nu_{2} = 0.22$.\n\nWe calculate the compliance term for each material:\n$$\n\\frac{1 - \\nu_{1}^{2}}{E_{1}} = \\frac{1 - (0.45)^{2}}{1.00 \\times 10^{8}} = \\frac{1 - 0.2025}{1.00 \\times 10^{8}} = \\frac{0.7975}{1.00 \\times 10^{8}} = 7.975 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\mathrm{Pa}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1 - \\nu_{2}^{2}}{E_{2}} = \\frac{1 - (0.22)^{2}}{1.69 \\times 10^{11}} = \\frac{1 - 0.0484}{1.69 \\times 10^{11}} = \\frac{0.9516}{1.69 \\times 10^{11}} \\approx 5.63077 \\times 10^{-12} \\, \\mathrm{Pa}^{-1}\n$$\nThe total effective compliance is the sum:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{E^{*}} = (7.975 \\times 10^{-9}) + (5.63077 \\times 10^{-12}) = 7.98063077 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\mathrm{Pa}^{-1}\n$$\nTherefore, the effective modulus is:\n$$\nE^{*} = \\frac{1}{7.98063077 \\times 10^{-9}} \\approx 1.253026 \\times 10^{8} \\, \\mathrm{Pa}\n$$\nAs expected, since the pad is much softer than the silicon wafer ($E_{1} \\ll E_{2}$), the effective modulus $E^{*}$ is dominated by the properties of the pad.\n\n**2b. Calculation of Normal Stiffness ($k_n$)**\n\nNow we can substitute the values for $W$, $R$, and $E^{*}$ into our derived formula for $k_n$:\n- Normal load: $W = 6.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n- Asperity radius: $R = 2.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n- Effective modulus: $E^{*} \\approx 1.253026 \\times 10^{8} \\, \\mathrm{Pa}$.\n\n$$\nk_n = \\left( 6 (6.0 \\times 10^{-6}) (2.0 \\times 10^{-5}) (1.253026 \\times 10^{8})^{2} \\right)^{1/3}\n$$\n$$\nk_n = \\left( (7.2 \\times 10^{-10}) (1.570075 \\times 10^{16}) \\right)^{1/3}\n$$\n$$\nk_n = \\left( 1.130454 \\times 10^{7} \\right)^{1/3} \\, \\mathrm{N/m}\n$$\n$$\nk_n \\approx 224.403 \\, \\mathrm{N/m}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$\nk_n \\approx 224 \\, \\mathrm{N/m}\n$$\n\n**3. Physical Interpretation**\n\nThe problem asks for an interpretation of how the compliance of pad asperities modulates the transmission of macroscopic applied pressure to local contact pressure. The key relationship is between the asperity-level load $W$ and the resulting local pressure, which is distributed over the contact area $A = \\pi a^2$. The mean contact pressure is $P_{mean} = W/A$.\n\nOur analysis is based on the Hertzian relations. For a given asperity load $W$, the indentation $\\delta$ and contact radius $a$ are determined by:\n$$\n\\delta = \\left(\\frac{3W}{4 E^{*} R^{1/2}}\\right)^{2/3} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad a = \\left(\\frac{3WR}{4E^{*}}\\right)^{1/3}\n$$\nThe compliance of the pad is primarily determined by its Young's modulus $E_{1}$, which in turn dominates the effective modulus $E^{*}$ (since $E_{1} \\ll E_{2}$). A more compliant pad has a lower $E^{*}$.\n\nFrom the expression for $a$, we see that for a fixed load $W$ and radius $R$, the contact radius $a$ is inversely proportional to $E^{*1/3}$: $a \\propto (E^{*})^{-1/3}$. This means that a more compliant pad (lower $E^{*}$) will result in a larger contact radius $a$.\n\nThe mean local pressure is $P_{mean} = \\frac{W}{\\pi a^2}$. Since $a$ increases as $E^{*}$ decreases, the local pressure decreases. Specifically, since $a^2 \\propto (E^{*})^{-2/3}$, we have $P_{mean} \\propto (E^{*})^{2/3}$.\n\nTherefore, the physical interpretation is as follows:\nA pad with higher compliance (lower effective modulus $E^{*}$) deforms more under a given load from the macroscopic applied pressure. This larger deformation creates a larger contact area ($a$) for each asperity. By spreading the asperity load $W$ over a larger area, the local contact pressure ($P_{mean}$) is reduced. Conversely, a stiffer, less compliant pad (higher $E^{*}$) leads to smaller contact areas and concentrates the load, resulting in significantly higher local pressures.\n\nIn the context of CMP, this modulation is critical. High local pressures can lead to scratching and subsurface damage on the wafer. Using a more compliant pad allows for a more gentle distribution of the applied macroscopic pressure at the micro-scale, helping to achieve a smooth, damage-free surface while still enabling the chemical-mechanical polishing action. The compliance of the pad, characterized by $E^{*}$, is a key design parameter for controlling the polishing process.",

            "introduction": "While the elastic model provides a starting point, pad materials are not infinitely strong and will yield under sufficient pressure. This practice  introduces the concept of plastic deformation, which is governed by the material's hardness, $H$. You will compare the real contact area predicted by a purely elastic model against that from a fully plastic model, forcing a critical assessment of which deformation regime likely dominates under typical CMP loads. This analysis is vital for predicting material removal rates and potential surface damage, as plastic contact is often associated with the mechanical component of polishing.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is internally consistent, scientifically grounded in the principles of contact mechanics, and provides all necessary information to derive the required expression and calculate its value.

This requires determining the real contact area under two distinct assumptions: fully plastic contact and fully elastic contact.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total normal load $W$ on the nominal contact patch. The nominal area is $A_{0} = 1\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{2} = 1 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}$ and the applied normal stress is $p_{0} = 30\\,\\mathrm{kPa} = 30 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.\nThe total load $W$ is given by:\n$$W = p_{0} A_{0} = (30 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{N/m^2}) \\times (1 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^2}) = 0.03\\,\\mathrm{N}$$\n\nNext, we determine the real contact area assuming the contact is fully plastic, denoted as $A_{\\mathrm{plastic}}$.

The model consists of $N = 5000$ identical spherical asperities sharing the total load $W$ equally. The load on a single asperity, $F$, is:\n$$F = \\frac{W}{N}$$\nThe problem provides the Hertzian contact relation for the area of a single asperity, $A_{i}$, as a function of the load $F$ it bears:\n$$A_{i} = \\pi \\left(\\frac{3 F R}{4 E^{*}}\\right)^{2/3}$$\nwhere $R = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$ is the asperity radius and $E^{*} = 80\\,\\mathrm{MPa} = 80 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$ is the effective elastic modulus.\nSince all asperities are identical and share the load equally, the total elastic real area $A_{\\mathrm{elastic}}$ is $N$ times the area of a single asperity:\n$$A_{\\mathrm{elastic}} = N A_{i} = N \\pi \\left(\\frac{3 F R}{4 E^{*}}\\right)^{2/3}$$\nSubstituting $F = W/N$:\n$$A_{\\mathrm{elastic}} = N \\pi \\left(\\frac{3 (W/N) R}{4 E^{*}}\\right)^{2/3} = N \\pi \\left(N^{-2/3}\\right) \\left(\\frac{3 W R}{4 E^{*}}\\right)^{2/3}$$\n$$A_{\\mathrm{elastic}} = N^{1/3} \\pi \\left(\\frac{3 W R}{4 E^{*}}\\right)^{2/3}$$\nThis is the general expression for the total elastic contact area.

Symbolically:\n$$\\Lambda = \\frac{W/H}{N^{1/3} \\pi \\left(\\frac{3 W R}{4 E^{*}}\\right)^{2/3}}$$\nThis can be simplified by collecting terms involving $W$:\n$$\\Lambda = \\frac{W^{1}}{W^{2/3}} \\frac{1}{H N^{1/3} \\pi} \\left(\\frac{4 E^{*}}{3 R}\\right)^{2/3} = \\frac{W^{1/3}}{H N^{1/3} \\pi} \\left(\\frac{4 E^{*}}{3 R}\\right)^{2/3}$$\n$$\\Lambda = \\frac{(4/3)^{2/3}}{\\pi H} \\left(\\frac{W (E^{*})^{2}}{N R^{2}}\\right)^{1/3}$$\nSince $W = p_0 A_0$, the expression in terms of the initial given parameters is:\n$$\\Lambda = \\frac{(4/3)^{2/3}}{\\pi H} \\left(\\frac{p_0 A_0 (E^{*})^{2}}{N R^{2}}\\right)^{1/3}$$\n\nFinally, we evaluate $\\Lambda$ numerically using the calculated values for the areas:\n$$\\Lambda = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{plastic}}}{A_{\\mathrm{elastic}}} = \\frac{5 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}}{1.0701 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}} \\approx 0.046724$$\nThe value of $\\Lambda$ is a ratio of areas and is therefore dimensionless, as required.\n\nQualitatively, the ratio $\\Lambda$ compares the real contact area predicted by a fully plastic model to that predicted by a fully elastic model. A value of $\\Lambda \\ll 1$ implies that the mean pressure over the elastic contact area ($p_{e} = W/A_{\\mathrm{elastic}}$) is much smaller than the hardness $H$. Specifically, $p_{e} = (W/A_{\\mathrm{plastic}})(A_{\\mathrm{plastic}}/A_{\\mathrm{elastic}}) = H \\Lambda$. In this case, the maximum Hertzian contact pressure would be $p_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{3}{2} p_e = \\frac{3}{2} H \\Lambda \\approx \\frac{3}{2} (60\\,\\mathrm{MPa})(0.0467) \\approx 4.2\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$. Since this maximum pressure is substantially lower than the material hardness $H=60\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, the assumption of elastic behavior is self-consistent and little to no plastic deformation is expected. Therefore, the contact regime is dominated by elastic deformation.\n\nRounding the final numerical result to three significant figures, we get $\\Lambda = 0.0467$.",

This point of instability is found by setting the derivative of $W$ with respect to $a$ to zero:\n$$ \\frac{dW}{da} = \\frac{d}{da} \\left( \\frac{4E^*a^3}{3R} - \\sqrt{8\\pi E^* \\Delta \\gamma a^3} \\right) = \\frac{4E^*}{3R}(3a^2) - \\sqrt{8\\pi E^* \\Delta \\gamma} \\left(\\frac{3}{2}a^{1/2}\\right) = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{4E^*a^2}{R} = \\frac{3}{2} \\sqrt{8\\pi E^* \\Delta \\gamma} a^{1/2} $$\nSolving for the critical contact radius $a_c$ at which pull-off occurs:\n$$ a_c^{3/2} = \\frac{3R}{8E^*} \\sqrt{8\\pi E^* \\Delta \\gamma} = \\frac{3R \\sqrt{8\\pi \\Delta \\gamma}}{8\\sqrt{E^*}} $$\n$$ a_c^3 = \\left( \\frac{3R \\sqrt{8\\pi \\Delta \\gamma}}{8\\sqrt{E^*}} \\right)^2 = \\frac{9R^2 (8\\pi \\Delta \\gamma)}{64 E^*} = \\frac{9\\pi R^2 \\Delta \\gamma}{8E^*} $$\nSubstituting this critical radius $a_c^3$ back into the expression for $W(a)$ gives the pull-off load $W_{\\text{pull-off}}$:\n$$ W_{\\text{pull-off}} = \\frac{4E^*}{3R} \\left( \\frac{9\\pi R^2 \\Delta \\gamma}{8E^*} \\right) - \\sqrt{8\\pi E^* \\Delta \\gamma \\left( \\frac{9\\pi R^2 \\Delta \\gamma}{8E^*} \\right)} $$\n$$ W_{\\text{pull-off}} = \\frac{3}{2}\\pi R \\Delta \\gamma - \\sqrt{9\\pi^2 R^2 (\\Delta \\gamma)^2} = \\frac{3}{2}\\pi R \\Delta \\gamma - 3\\pi R \\Delta \\gamma $$\n$$ W_{\\text{pull-off}} = -\\frac{3}{2}\\pi R \\Delta \\gamma $$\nThe pull-off force $W_c$ is the magnitude of this tensile load required to separate the surfaces.\n$$ W_{c}^{\\mathrm{JKR}} = \\frac{3}{2}\\pi R \\Delta \\gamma $$\n\n**DMT Model:**\nThe DMT model is applicable to stiff contacts where long-range adhesive forces act outside the contact patch. In this model, the total interaction force is a simple superposition of the Hertzian elastic repulsion force $W_H$ and an adhesive attraction force $W_A$ that is independent of the contact area.\n$$ W(a) = W_H(a) + W_A $$\nThe elastic force is given by the Hertz theory: $W_H(a) = \\frac{4E^*a^3}{3R}$. The adhesive force, for a sphere of radius $R$ interacting with a plane, is found by integrating the surface attractive forces over the entire non-contacting area, which results in a constant attractive force:\n$$ W_A = -2\\pi R \\Delta \\gamma $$\nThus, the total load is:\n$$ W(a) = \\frac{4E^*a^3}{3R} - 2\\pi R \\Delta \\gamma $$\nPull-off occurs when the contact radius shrinks to zero ($a \\rightarrow 0$). At this point, the elastic repulsive force vanishes ($W_H \\rightarrow 0$), and the only force remaining is the adhesive attraction. The external load required to just cause separation is equal and opposite to this attraction.\n$$ W_{\\text{pull-off}} = W(a=0) = -2\\pi R \\Delta \\gamma $$\nThe pull-off force $W_c$ is the magnitude of this load.\n$$ W_{c}^{\\mathrm{DMT}} = 2\\pi R \\Delta \\gamma $$\n\n**Task 2: Numerical Calculation and Comparison**\n\nFirst, we convert all given parameters to base SI units.\n- $R = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $\\Delta \\gamma = 0.06\\,\\mathrm{J/m^2} = 0.06\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$\n- $p_{\\mathrm{op}} = 50\\,\\mathrm{kPa} = 5.0 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n- $n_{\\mathrm{asp}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-2}}$\n\n**JKR Limit Calculations:**\nThe single-asperity pull-off force is:\n$$ W_{c}^{\\mathrm{JKR}} = \\frac{3}{2}\\pi (1.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}) (0.06\\,\\mathrm{N/m}) \\approx 2.8274 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{N} $$\nAs requested, this is expressed in milliNewtons ($\\mathrm{mN}$) and rounded to three significant figures:\n$$ W_{c}^{\\mathrm{JKR}} = (2.8274 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{mN} \\approx 2.83 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mN} $$\nThe total adhesive traction (tensile stress) on the macroscopic scale is the force per asperity multiplied by the number density of asperities:\n$$ t^{\\mathrm{JKR}} = n_{\\mathrm{asp}} W_{c}^{\\mathrm{JKR}} = (2.0 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-2}}) (2.8274 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{N}) \\approx 5655\\,\\mathrm{N/m^2} = 5655\\,\\mathrm{Pa} $$\nExpressed in kilopascals:\n$$ t^{\\mathrm{JKR}} \\approx 5.66\\,\\mathrm{kPa} $$\nComparing this to the nominal operating pressure:\n$$ \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{op}}}{t^{\\mathrm{JKR}}} = \\frac{50\\,\\mathrm{kPa}}{5.655\\,\\mathrm{kPa}} \\approx 8.84 $$\nSince $p_{\\mathrm{op}} > t^{\\mathrm{JKR}}$, the operating pressure is sufficient to overcome the adhesive hysteresis in the JKR limit.\n\n**DMT Limit Calculations:**\nThe single-asperity pull-off force is:\n$$ W_{c}^{\\mathrm{DMT}} = 2\\pi (1.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}) (0.06\\,\\mathrm{N/m}) \\approx 3.7699 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{N} $$\nExpressed in milliNewtons ($\\mathrm{mN}$) and rounded to three significant figures:\n$$ W_{c}^{\\mathrm{DMT}} = (3.7699 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{mN} \\approx 3.77 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mN} $$\nThe total adhesive traction is:\n$$ t^{\\mathrm{DMT}} = n_{\\mathrm{asp}} W_{c}^{\\mathrm{DMT}} = (2.0 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-2}}) (3.7699 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{N}) \\approx 7540\\,\\mathrm{N/m^2} = 7540\\,\\mathrm{Pa} $$\nExpressed in kilopascals:\n$$ t^{\\mathrm{DMT}} \\approx 7.54\\,\\mathrm{kPa} $$\nComparing this to the nominal operating pressure:\n$$ \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{op}}}{t^{\\mathrm{DMT}}} = \\frac{50\\,\\mathrm{kPa}}{7.540\\,\\mathrm{kPa}} \\approx 6.63 $$\nSince $p_{\\mathrm{op}} > t^{\\mathrm{DMT}}$, the operating pressure is also sufficient to overcome the adhesive hysteresis in the DMT limit.\n\nIn both bounding cases, the nominal compressive pressure of the CMP process significantly exceeds the maximal adhesive tension that the asperity population can generate at pull-off. This implies that adhesive effects, while present at the asperity scale, are unlikely to cause macroscopic adhesion or \"stiction\" of the pad to the wafer under these operating conditions. The system is operating in a compression-dominated regime.",
