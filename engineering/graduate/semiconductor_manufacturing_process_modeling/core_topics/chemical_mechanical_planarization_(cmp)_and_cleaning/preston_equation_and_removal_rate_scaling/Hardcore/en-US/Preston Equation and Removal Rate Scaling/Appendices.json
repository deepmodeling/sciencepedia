In the relative form, the total squared relative uncertainty is the sum of the squared relative uncertainties of the inputs:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{u_K}{K} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{u_R}{R} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{u_P}{P} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{u_V}{V} \\right)^2 $$\nTo identify the dominant source, we compare the numerical value of each term in this sum:\n- Contribution from $R$: $\\left(\\frac{u_R}{R}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{18}\\right)^2 \\approx 0.003086$\n- Contribution from $V$: $\\left(\\frac{u_V}{V}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{20}\\right)^2 = 0.002500$\n- Contribution from $P$: $\\left(\\frac{u_P}{P}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{60}\\right)^2 \\approx 0.000278$\n\nComparing these values, $0.003086 > 0.002500 > 0.000278$. The largest contribution to the variance of $K$ comes from the uncertainty in the removal rate, $R$. This is because the relative uncertainty in $R$ ($\\frac{u_R}{R} = \\frac{1}{18} \\approx 5.6\\%$) is the largest of the three input relative uncertainties ($\\frac{u_V}{V} = 5.0\\%$, $\\frac{u_P}{P} \\approx 1.7\\%$). Because of the simple multiplicative structure of Preston's equation, the input with the largest relative uncertainty dominates the relative uncertainty of the result.\n\nThe final numerical answer required is the value for $u_K$.",

The full model for run $j$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}_{j} = \\mathbf{D}_{j}\\mathbf{k} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_{j}, \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_{j} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0}, \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{j})\n$$\nThe probability density function (PDF) for the measurements $\\mathbf{r}_{j}$ given $\\mathbf{k}$ is:\n$$\nP(\\mathbf{r}_{j}|\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^{N/2} \\det(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{j})^{1/2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{r}_{j} - \\mathbf{D}_{j}\\mathbf{k})^{T}\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{j}^{-1}(\\mathbf{r}_{j} - \\mathbf{D}_{j}\\mathbf{k})\\right)\n$$\nAssuming the $J$ process runs are statistically independent, the total likelihood of all measurements $\\{\\mathbf{r}_{j}\\}_{j=1}^{J}$ is the product of the individual likelihoods:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\prod_{j=1}^{J} P(\\mathbf{r}_{j}|\\mathbf{k})\n$$\nThe maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of $\\mathbf{k}$ is found by maximizing $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{k})$, which is equivalent to minimizing the negative log-likelihood, $-\\ln(\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{k}))$:\n$$\n-\\ln(\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{k})) = -\\sum_{j=1}^{J} \\ln(P(\\mathbf{r}_{j}|\\mathbf{k})) = \\sum_{j=1}^{J} \\left( \\frac{N}{2}\\ln(2\\pi) + \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(\\det(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{j})) + \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{r}_{j} - \\mathbf{D}_{j}\\mathbf{k})^{T}\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{j}^{-1}(\\mathbf{r}_{j} - \\mathbf{D}_{j}\\mathbf{k}) \\right)\n$$\nTo find the optimal $\\mathbf{k}$, we can discard the constant terms, which leaves us with the weighted least-squares (WLS) objective function:\n$$\nJ_{\\text{WLS}}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{J} (\\mathbf{r}_{j} - \\mathbf{D}_{j}\\mathbf{k})^{T}\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{j}^{-1}(\\mathbf{r}_{j} - \\mathbf{D}_{j}\\mathbf{k})\n$$\nThe problem requires adding a Tikhonov regularization term to promote smoothness. The regularization term is given by $\\lambda \\|\\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{k}\\|_{2}^{2} = \\lambda (\\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{k})^{T}(\\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{k}) = \\lambda \\mathbf{k}^{T}\\mathbf{L}^{T}\\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{k}$. The complete regularized WLS objective function to minimize is:\n$$\nJ(\\mathbf{k}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{J} (\\mathbf{r}_{j} - \\mathbf{D}_{j}\\mathbf{k})^{T}\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{j}^{-1}(\\mathbf{r}_{j} - \\mathbf{D}_{j}\\mathbf{k}) + \\lambda \\mathbf{k}^{T}\\mathbf{L}^{T}\\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{k}\n$$\nTo find the estimator $\\widehat{\\mathbf{k}}$ that minimizes $J(\\mathbf{k})$, we compute the gradient of $J(\\mathbf{k})$ with respect to $\\mathbf{k}$ and set it to zero. Using the matrix calculus identity $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}} (\\mathbf{b}-\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x})^{T}\\mathbf{C}(\\mathbf{b}-\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}) = 2\\mathbf{A}^{T}\\mathbf{C}(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{b})$ and $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}} \\mathbf{x}^{T}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{x} = 2\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{x}$ for symmetric $\\mathbf{B}$, the gradient is:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}}J(\\mathbf{k}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{J} 2\\mathbf{D}_{j}^{T}\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{j}^{-1}(\\mathbf{D}_{j}\\mathbf{k} - \\mathbf{r}_{j}) + 2\\lambda\\mathbf{L}^{T}\\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{k}\n$$\nNote that $\\mathbf{D}_{j}$ is a diagonal matrix, so $\\mathbf{D}_{j}^{T} = \\mathbf{D}_{j}$. Also, $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_j$ is positive definite, so $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_j^{-1}$ is symmetric. The matrix $\\mathbf{L}^{T}\\mathbf{L}$ is also symmetric.\nSetting the gradient to $\\mathbf{0}$ and dividing by $2$:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{J} \\mathbf{D}_{j}\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{j}^{-1}(\\mathbf{D}_{j}\\mathbf{k} - \\mathbf{r}_{j}) + \\lambda\\mathbf{L}^{T}\\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{k} = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nExpanding and rearranging terms to group $\\mathbf{k}$:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{J} \\mathbf{D}_{j}\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{j}^{-1}\\mathbf{D}_{j}\\mathbf{k} - \\sum_{j=1}^{J} \\mathbf{D}_{j}\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{j}^{-1}\\mathbf{r}_{j} + \\lambda\\mathbf{L}^{T}\\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{k} = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nFactoring out $\\mathbf{k}$ leads to the normal equations:\n$$\n\\left( \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{J} \\mathbf{D}_{j}\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{j}^{-1}\\mathbf{D}_{j}\\right) + \\lambda\\mathbf{L}^{T}\\mathbf{L} \\right) \\mathbf{k} = \\sum_{j=1}^{J} \\mathbf{D}_{j}\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{j}^{-1}\\mathbf{r}_{j}\n$$\nThe matrix multiplying $\\mathbf{k}$ is invertible due to the Tikhonov regularization term (since $\\lambda0$ and the sum of positive semi-definite matrices is at least positive semi-definite, the regularization often makes it positive definite, guaranteeing invertibility). Solving for $\\mathbf{k}$ yields the estimator $\\widehat{\\mathbf{k}}$:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\mathbf{k}} = \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{J} \\mathbf{D}_{j}\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{j}^{-1}\\mathbf{D}_{j} + \\lambda\\mathbf{L}^{T}\\mathbf{L} \\right)^{-1} \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{J} \\mathbf{D}_{j}\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{j}^{-1}\\mathbf{r}_{j} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting back the definition $\\mathbf{D}_{j} = \\text{diag}(\\mathbf{p}_{j} \\circ \\mathbf{v}_{j})$, we obtain the final closed-form expression.",
