            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a dimensionless group that quantifies the relative importance of solutal Marangoni advection to molecular diffusion at a liquid interface, followed by a numerical calculation of this group and an assessment of the flow direction.\n\nFirst, we derive the dimensionless group using scaling analysis of the governing physical principles. The flow at the interface is driven by a surface tension gradient, which creates a shear stress. This is the Marangoni effect.\n\nThe tangential stress balance at the free surface ($y=0$) equates the viscous shear stress in the liquid to the surface tension gradient. Assuming the interface is in the $x-z$ plane, the balance in the streamwise direction $x$ is:\n$$ \\mu \\left. \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\right|_{y=0} = \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial x} $$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the liquid, $u$ is the velocity component in the $x$ direction, $y$ is the coordinate normal to the interface, and $\\sigma$ is the surface tension.\n\nThe surface tension $\\sigma$ is a function of the solute concentration $C$. Using the chain rule, the surface tension gradient can be expressed as:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial x} = \\frac{d\\sigma}{dC} \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} $$\nSubstituting this into the stress balance gives:\n$$ \\mu \\left. \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\right|_{y=0} = \\frac{d\\sigma}{dC} \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} $$\nTo find a characteristic velocity scale $U$ for the flow, we perform a scaling analysis on this equation. Let $L$ be the characteristic length over which the concentration changes by $\\Delta C$. The most straightforward scaling balances the characteristic Marangoni stress $\\Delta \\sigma / L$ with a characteristic viscous stress $\\mu U / L$, assuming the relevant length scale for the velocity gradient is $L$. This gives:\n$$ \\mu \\frac{U}{L} \\sim \\left| \\frac{d\\sigma}{dC} \\right| \\frac{\\Delta C}{L} $$\nThis simplifies to a characteristic surface velocity scale, often called the Marangoni velocity $U_M$:\n$$ U \\sim \\frac{|\\frac{d\\sigma}{dC}| \\Delta C}{\\mu} $$\n\nNext, we consider the transport of the solute itself. The quasi-steady advection-diffusion equation for the solute concentration $C$ in a two-dimensional domain is:\n$$ u \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial y} = D \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial y^2} \\right) $$\nwhere $D$ is the molecular diffusivity of the solute. Along the free surface, the normal velocity component $v$ is zero. We analyze the balance between advection in the $x$ direction and diffusion.\n- Advection term: $u \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} \\sim U \\frac{\\Delta C}{L}$\n- Diffusion term: $D \\nabla^2 C \\sim D \\frac{\\Delta C}{L^2}$ (assuming diffusion is isotropic with characteristic length $L$).\n\nThe problem asks for a dimensionless group that compares advection to diffusion. This is the Péclet number, $Pe$, defined as the ratio of the advective transport rate to the diffusive transport rate:\n$$ Pe = \\frac{\\text{Advection}}{\\text{Diffusion}} = \\frac{U \\frac{\\Delta C}{L}}{D \\frac{\\Delta C}{L^2}} = \\frac{UL}{D} $$\nSubstituting the characteristic Marangoni velocity $U \\sim \\frac{|\\frac{d\\sigma}{dC}| \\Delta C}{\\mu}$ into the expression for the Péclet number gives the desired dimensionless group, which can be identified as a form of the solutal Marangoni number, $Ma_C$:\n$$ Ma_C = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{|\\frac{d\\sigma}{dC}| \\Delta C}{\\mu} \\right) L}{D} = \\frac{|\\frac{d\\sigma}{dC}| \\Delta C L}{\\mu D} $$\nThis number represents the ratio of transport by surface-tension-driven flow to transport by molecular diffusion. A large value implies advection dominates.\n\nNow, we compute the value of this dimensionless group using the provided data:\n- Magnitude of surface tension sensitivity: $|\\frac{d\\sigma}{dC}| = 1.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\\,(\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3})^{-1}$\n- Concentration difference: $\\Delta C = 8.0\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n- Characteristic length: $L = 1.5 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- Dynamic viscosity: $\\mu = 8.9 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n- Molecular diffusivity: $D = 7.0 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nSubstitute these values into the derived expression:\n$$ Ma_C = \\frac{(1.5 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times (8.0) \\times (1.5 \\times 10^{-2})}{(8.9 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times (7.0 \\times 10^{-10})} $$\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = (1.5 \\times 8.0 \\times 1.5) \\times (10^{-4} \\times 10^{-2}) = 18.0 \\times 10^{-6} = 1.8 \\times 10^{-5} $$\nNext, calculate the denominator:\n$$ \\text{Denominator} = (8.9 \\times 7.0) \\times (10^{-4} \\times 10^{-10}) = 62.3 \\times 10^{-14} = 6.23 \\times 10^{-13} $$\nFinally, compute the ratio:\n$$ Ma_C = \\frac{1.8 \\times 10^{-5}}{6.23 \\times 10^{-13}} \\approx 0.288924558 \\times 10^8 \\approx 2.889 \\times 10^7 $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the value of the dimensionless group is $2.89 \\times 10^7$. The large magnitude indicates that solutal advection is overwhelmingly dominant compared to molecular diffusion.\n\nFinally, we assess the flow direction. The surface shear stress, which drives the flow, is given by $\\tau = \\frac{d\\sigma}{dx} = \\frac{d\\sigma}{dC}\\frac{dC}{dx}$. The force on the fluid is in the same direction as this stress.\n- For the solutal case: It is given that $\\frac{d\\sigma}{dC}  0$. It is given that the concentration $C$ increases toward the contact line, meaning $\\frac{dC}{dx} > 0$ (assuming $x$ increases towards the contact line). Therefore, the stress is $\\tau = (\\text{negative}) \\times (\\text{positive})  0$. A negative stress indicates a force in the negative $x$ direction. Fluid is pulled from the region of lower surface tension (high concentration, near the contact line) towards the region of higher surface tension (low concentration, in the bulk interior). The flow is away from the contact line.\n- For the comparative thermal case: It is given that $\\frac{d\\sigma}{dT}  0$ (typical for most liquids). It is given that the contact line is warmer, meaning $\\frac{dT}{dx} > 0$. Therefore, the stress is $\\tau = \\frac{d\\sigma}{dT}\\frac{dT}{dx} = (\\text{negative}) \\times (\\text{positive})  0$. This also results in a force and flow in the negative $x$ direction, away from the contact line.\nBased on this analysis, the solutal surface-tension-driven shear would generate flow in the same direction as the specified thermal case, not reverse it.",

The rate of change of film thickness, $h(x,t)$, is determined by the local evaporation mass flux, $J(x)$. The mass of the liquid film per unit area is $\\rho h$, where $\\rho$ is the liquid density, assumed constant.

The mass of surfactant per unit area is given by the product of the total liquid mass per unit area ($\\rho h$) and the surfactant mass fraction $C$. As the surfactant is nonvolatile and lateral transport is neglected, the mass of surfactant in a vertical column of the film remains constant over time.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(C \\rho h) = 0\n$$\nSince $\\rho$ is constant, we have $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(Ch) = 0$. This implies that the product $C(x,t)h(x,t)$ is constant in time for any given position $x$. At time $t=0$, the film has uniform thickness $h_0$ and uniform concentration $C_0$. Therefore:\n$$\nC(x,t)h(x,t) = C(x,0)h(x,0) = C_0 h_0\n$$\nThis gives an expression for the concentration at any time and position:\n$$\nC(x,t) = \\frac{C_0 h_0}{h(x,t)}\n$$\nWe need to determine the concentration gradient, $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}$.

Thus, the gradient of the film thickness evolves as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x}(x,t) = -\\frac{J_1 t}{\\rho}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this into the expression for the concentration gradient:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{C(x,t)}{h(x,t)}\\left(-\\frac{J_1 t}{\\rho}\\right) = \\frac{C(x,t)}{h(x,t)}\\frac{J_1 t}{\\rho}\n$$\nUsing $C(x,t) = C_0 h_0 / h(x,t)$, we find:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} = \\frac{C_0 h_0}{h(x,t)^2}\\frac{J_1 t}{\\rho}\n$$\nThis expression demonstrates that the concentration gradient depends on the local film thickness $h(x,t)$, which varies with both position $x$ and time $t$. However, the problem requests an expression for $t^{\\ast}$ that is independent of $x$, $L$, and $J_0$. This strongly implies that an approximation is intended under the \"early-time dynamics\" assumption. For early times, the film thinning is small compared to the initial thickness, i.e., $h(x,t) \\approx h_0$. Applying this approximation linearizes the problem and renders the concentration gradient uniform in space for a given time $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} \\approx \\frac{C_0 h_0}{\\left(h_0\\right)^2}\\frac{J_1 t}{\\rho} = \\frac{C_0 J_1 t}{\\rho h_0}\n$$\nThe switching time $t^{\\ast}$ is defined as the time when the magnitude of the solutocapillary surface tension gradient equals that of the thermocapillary gradient:\n$$\ns_C \\left|\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}\\right|_{t=t^{\\ast}} = s_T \\left|\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\\right|\n$$\nWe are given $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} = G_T$.
