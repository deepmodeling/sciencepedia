Consider a semi-infinite wafer occupying $x \\ge 0$ and a dopant that diffuses with a constant intrinsic diffusivity during the spike. The spike anneal lasts for a duration $t=\\tau$, and outside the spike the temperature is sufficiently low that diffusion is negligible. During the spike, the boundary condition at the surface is $C(0,t)=C_{\\mathrm{ss}}$, where $C_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ is the solid solubility at the spike temperature, and the initial condition prior to the spike is $C(x,0)=0$.

The context of semiconductor manufacturing, including concepts like spike anneal, solid solubility, and junction depth, is appropriate and well-defined. The problem is well-posed, providing a linear partial differential equation with sufficient and consistent initial and boundary conditions for a semi-infinite domain, which guarantees a unique, stable solution.

The wafer is initially free of the dopant.\n2.  **Surface Boundary Condition**: $C(0,t) = C_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ for $t > 0$. The surface concentration is held constant at the solid solubility limit.\n3.  **Far-field Boundary Condition**: $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} C(x,t) = 0$ for $t \\ge 0$. The wafer is semi-infinite.\n\nThis is a classic diffusion problem with a standard solution. The problem can be solved using the Boltzmann transformation with a similarity variable $\\eta = \\frac{x}{2\\sqrt{Dt}}$. This transforms the partial differential equation (PDE) into an ordinary differential equation (ODE). The solution to this PDE that satisfies the given boundary and initial conditions is expressed in terms of the complementary error function, $\\mathrm{erfc}(z)$:\n$$\nC(x,t) = C_{\\mathrm{ss}} \\cdot \\mathrm{erfc}\\left(\\frac{x}{2\\sqrt{Dt}}\\right)\n$$\nwhere the complementary error function is defined as $\\mathrm{erfc}(z) = 1 - \\mathrm{erf}(z) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\int_z^\\infty \\exp(-u^2) du$.\n\nThe problem asks for the junction depth, $x_j$, at the end of the spike anneal, which has a duration of $t=\\tau$. The junction depth is defined as the position $x_j$ where the dopant concentration equals a specific value $C_j$.\nSetting $C(x_j, \\tau) = C_j$, we have:\n$$\nC_j = C_{\\mathrm{ss}} \\cdot \\mathrm{erfc}\\left(\\frac{x_j}{2\\sqrt{D\\tau}}\\right)\n$$\nTo solve for $x_j$, we first isolate the $\\mathrm{erfc}$ term:\n$$\n\\frac{C_j}{C_{\\mathrm{ss}}} = \\mathrm{erfc}\\left(\\frac{x_j}{2\\sqrt{D\\tau}}\\right)\n$$\nNext, we apply the inverse complementary error function, $\\mathrm{erfc}^{-1}$, to both sides:\n$$\n\\mathrm{erfc}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{C_j}{C_{\\mathrm{ss}}}\\right) = \\frac{x_j}{2\\sqrt{D\\tau}}\n$$\nFinally, we solve for $x_j$:\n$$\nx_j = 2\\sqrt{D\\tau} \\cdot \\mathrm{erfc}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{C_j}{C_{\\mathrm{ss}}}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression.\nThe parameters are:\n$D = 4.0 \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{cm^2/s}$\n$\\tau = 0.50\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n$C_{\\mathrm{ss}} = 4.0 \\times 10^{20}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$\n$C_j = 4.0 \\times 10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$\n\nFirst, calculate the ratio of the junction concentration to the solid solubility:\n$$\n\\frac{C_j}{C_{\\mathrm{ss}}} = \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}}{4.0 \\times 10^{20}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}} = \\frac{1}{100} = 0.01\n$$\nNext, we find the value of the inverse complementary error function for this argument. Using standard mathematical libraries or lookup tables:\n$$\n\\mathrm{erfc}^{-1}(0.01) \\approx 1.821386\n$$\nNow, we calculate the characteristic diffusion length, $2\\sqrt{D\\tau}$:\n$$\n2\\sqrt{D\\tau} = 2\\sqrt{(4.0 \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{cm^2/s}) \\times (0.50\\,\\mathrm{s})} = 2\\sqrt{2.0 \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{cm^2}}\n$$\nTo simplify the square root, we can write $2.0 \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{cm^2}$ as $20 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{cm^2}$.\n$$\n2\\sqrt{D\\tau} = 2\\sqrt{20 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{cm^2}} = 2\\sqrt{20} \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{cm} \\approx 2 \\times 4.472136 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{cm} \\approx 8.944272 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{cm}\n$$\nNow we can compute the junction depth $x_j$ in centimeters:\n$$\nx_j \\approx (8.944272 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{cm}) \\times 1.821386 \\approx 1.62900 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{cm}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in nanometers.

The initial supersaturation is $S_{\\mathrm{I}}(0) = S_0 > 1$.\n\nAssume a fixed spike anneal temperature profile $$T(t) = T_{\\mathrm{base}} + \\left(T_{\\mathrm{peak}} - T_{\\mathrm{base}}\\right)\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(t - t_{\\mathrm{peak}})^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right),$$ defined on $t \\in [0,1]$ seconds, representing a Rapid Thermal Anneal (RTA) spike.\n\nUse the following scientifically consistent parameters:\n- Boltzmann constant: $$k_{\\mathrm{B}} = 8.617333262145 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{eV/K}.$$\n- Boron diffusivity parameters: $$D_0 = 1.5 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{s}, \\quad E_{\\mathrm{a}} = 3.46 \\ \\mathrm{eV}.$$\n- Supersaturation kinetics: $$S_0 = 10 \\ (\\text{dimensionless}), \\quad k_{\\mathrm{rel},0} = 1.0 \\times 10^9 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}, \\quad E_{\\mathrm{rel}} = 2.5 \\ \\mathrm{eV}.$$\n- Spike anneal profile: $$T_{\\mathrm{base}} = 873 \\ \\mathrm{K}, \\quad T_{\\mathrm{peak}} = 1323 \\ \\mathrm{K}, \\quad t_{\\mathrm{peak}} = 0.5 \\ \\mathrm{s}, \\quad \\sigma = 0.08 \\ \\mathrm{s}.$$\n- Co-implant trap kinetics:\n  - Carbon: $$k_{\\mathrm{trap},0}^{(\\mathrm{C})} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-18} \\ \\mathrm{cm}^3/\\mathrm{s}, \\quad E_{\\mathrm{trap}}^{(\\mathrm{C})} = 0.5 \\ \\mathrm{eV}.$$\n  - Fluorine: $$k_{\\mathrm{trap},0}^{(\\mathrm{F})} = 8.0 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{cm}^3/\\mathrm{s}, \\quad E_{\\mathrm{trap}}^{(\\mathrm{F})} = 0.7 \\ \\mathrm{eV}.$$\n\nUnder these assumptions:\n- The supersaturation solution is $$S_{\\mathrm{I}}(t) - 1 = \\left(S_0 - 1\\right)\\exp\\!\\left(-\\int_0^t k_{\\mathrm{tot}}(\\tau)\\, d\\tau\\right).$$\n- The boron diffusion length over $t \\in [0,1]$ seconds is $$L = \\sqrt{2 \\int_0^1 D_{\\mathrm{B}}(t)\\, dt},$$ computed in $\\mathrm{cm}$ and then converted to $\\mathrm{nm}$ via $1 \\ \\mathrm{cm} = 10^7 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nImplement a program that, for a fixed spike profile, computes the baseline diffusion length (no co-implantation) and the reduction in diffusion length due to co-implantation for the following test suite:\n1. Baseline (no co-implantation): species none, $C = 0 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.\n2. Carbon co-implantation: $C = 1.0 \\times 10^{19} \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.\n3.

Fluorine co-implantation: $C = 5.0 \\times 10^{19} \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.\n\nFor each case with co-implantation, quantify the reduction in diffusion length relative to the baseline as a float in nanometers, defined by $$\\Delta L = L_{\\mathrm{baseline}} - L_{\\mathrm{case}}.$$ Express all outputs in nanometers, rounded to three decimal places.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the following order: baseline diffusion length in nanometers, reduction for Case 2, reduction for Case 3, reduction for Case 4, reduction for Case 5.

The parameters provided are physically realistic for silicon processing. This criterion is met.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a complete set of equations, parameters, and initial conditions to uniquely determine the evolution of the system and calculate the final diffusion length. The computational task is clearly defined and a unique, stable solution exists. This criterion is met.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, formal scientific language without any subjective or opinion-based content. This criterion is met.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: All necessary constants, functional forms, and boundary/initial conditions are provided. There are no contradictions in the setup.\n- **Feasibility**: The calculation involves solving a system of ordinary differential equations, which is a standard and computationally feasible task.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is **valid** as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. A detailed solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe objective is to compute the final diffusion length, $$L$$, of boron in silicon over a $$1$$-second spike anneal, defined as:\n$$L = \\sqrt{2 \\int_0^1 D_{\\mathrm{B}}(t)\\, dt}$$\nThis calculation must be performed for five cases: a baseline without co-implantation, and four cases with varying concentrations of co-implanted carbon or fluorine. The reduction in diffusion length, $$\\Delta L$$, relative to the baseline must then be computed.\n\nThe integrand, the effective boron diffusivity $$D_{\\mathrm{B}}(t)$$, is given by:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{B}}(t) = D_{\\mathrm{B,eq}}(T(t)) \\cdot S_{\\mathrm{I}}(t)$$\nwhere $$D_{\\mathrm{B,eq}}(T(t))$$ is the equilibrium diffusivity at the time-dependent temperature $$T(t)$$, and $$S_{\\mathrm{I}}(t)$$ is the time-dependent supersaturation of silicon self-interstitials.\n\nThe temperature profile $$T(t)$$ and the equilibrium diffusivity $$D_{\\mathrm{B,eq}}(T)$$ are given by explicit analytical functions. The primary challenge lies in determining the supersaturation $$S_{\\mathrm{I}}(t)$$. The problem states its evolution is governed by the first-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{I}}(t) - 1\\right) = -k_{\\mathrm{tot}}(t)\\left(S_{\\mathrm{I}}(t) - 1\\right), \\quad S_{\\mathrm{I}}(0) = S_0$$\nwhere $$k_{\\mathrm{tot}}(t)$$ is a time-dependent rate coefficient that itself depends on temperature.\n\nA direct numerical solution using the analytical form for $$S_{\\mathrm{I}}(t)$$ would involve a nested integral:\n$$L^2 = 2 \\int_0^1 D_{\\mathrm{B,eq}}(T(t)) \\left(1 + (S_0-1)\\exp\\left(-\\int_0^t k_{\\mathrm{tot}}(\\tau) d\\tau\\right) \\right) dt$$\nEvaluating such a nested integral numerically (e.g., calling a quadrature routine within the integrand of another) is computationally inefficient and can be prone to numerical instability.\n\nA more robust and standard approach is to reformulate the problem as a system of coupled first-order ODEs. Let us define two state variables:\n1.  $$Y(t) = S_{\\mathrm{I}}(t) - 1$$, representing the excess supersaturation.\n2.  $$Z(t) = \\int_0^t D_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\tau) d\\tau$$, representing the integrated diffusivity over time.\n\nThe governing equations for these variables are found by differentiation:\n1.  From the problem definition, the ODE for $$Y(t)$$ is:\n    $$\\frac{dY}{dt} = -k_{\\mathrm{tot}}(t) Y(t)$$\n    with the initial condition $$Y(0) = S_{\\mathrm{I}}(0) - 1 = S_0 - 1$$. The rate $$k_{\\mathrm{tot}}(t)$$ is calculated as $$k_{\\mathrm{rel}}(T(t)) + k_{\\mathrm{trap}}(T(t))C$$.\n\n2.  By the fundamental theorem of calculus, the ODE for $$Z(t)$$ is:\n    $$\\frac{dZ}{dt} = D_{\\mathrm{B}}(t) = D_{\\mathrm{B,eq}}(T(t)) S_{\\mathrm{I}}(t) = D_{\\mathrm{B,eq}}(T(t)) (Y(t) + 1)$$\n    with the initial condition $$Z(0) = 0$$.\n\nThis creates a system of two coupled ODEs:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{dY}{dt} = - \\left( k_{\\mathrm{rel}}(T(t)) + k_{\\mathrm{trap}}(T(t))C \\right) Y(t) \\\\\n\\frac{dZ}{dt} = D_{\\mathrm{B,eq}}(T(t)) (Y(t) + 1)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe initial value problem is fully defined with $$Y(0) = S_0 - 1$$ and $$Z(0) = 0$$.\n\nWe can solve this system numerically over the interval $$t \\in [0, 1]$$ using a standard numerical solver, such as `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`. The value of the state variable $$Z$$ at $$t=1$$, i.e., $$Z(1)$$, gives the required integral $$\\int_0^1 D_B(t) dt$$.\n\nThe final diffusion length is then calculated as:\n$$L = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot Z(1)}$$\nThe result, initially in cm, is converted to nm by multiplying by $$10^7$$.\n\nThis procedure is implemented for each of the five specified test cases. For the baseline case, the trap concentration $$C$$ is set to $$0$$. For the other cases, the appropriate parameters for carbon ($$k_{\\mathrm{trap},0}^{(\\mathrm{C})}, E_{\\mathrm{trap}}^{(\\mathrm{C})}$$) or fluorine ($$k_{\\mathrm{trap},0}^{(\\mathrm{F})}, E_{\\mathrm{trap}}^{(\\mathrm{F})}$$) are used with the specified concentrations $$C$$.\nThe baseline diffusion length, $$L_{\\mathrm{baseline}}$$, is obtained from the first case. The reduction for subsequent cases is computed as $$\\Delta L = L_{\\mathrm{baseline}} - L_{\\mathrm{case}}$$. The final list of results is assembled and formatted as required.",
