It uses established physical principles like Fick's first law of diffusion and first-order reaction kinetics. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary physical parameters, boundary conditions, and an initial condition to derive the requested differential equation and its asymptotic behavior. A unique, meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, standard terminology from physics and engineering, free from any subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is a standard, well-posed problem in semiconductor process modeling. I will proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\n**2. Derivation and Solution**\n\nThe derivation proceeds in three main steps: first, we determine the oxidant flux $J$ through the oxide layer; second, we relate this flux to the oxide growth rate to obtain a differential equation for the oxide thickness $x_{\\text{ox}}(t)$; third, we analyze the long-time asymptotic behavior of this equation.\n\nLet the spatial coordinate be $x$, with $x=0$ at the gas/oxide interface and $x=x_{\\text{ox}}(t)$ at the oxide/silicon interface. Let $C(x)$ be the concentration of the oxidant within the oxide layer.\n\nAccording to Fick's first law, the flux $J$ of the oxidant is proportional to the concentration gradient:\n$$J(x) = -D \\frac{\\mathrm{d}C(x)}{\\mathrm{d}x}$$\nThe problem states that the transport is quasi-steady. This implies that the flux $J$ is constant throughout the oxide layer for any given thickness $x_{\\text{ox}}$, i.e., $J(x)=J$. We can integrate Fick's law across the oxide layer from $x=0$ to $x=x_{\\text{ox}}$:\n$$\\int_{0}^{x_{\\text{ox}}} J \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{C(0)}^{C(x_{\\text{ox}})} -D \\, \\mathrm{d}C$$\n$$J x_{\\text{ox}} = -D [C(x_{\\text{ox}}) - C(0)] = D[C(0) - C(x_{\\text{ox}})]$$\n\nWe now apply the boundary conditions.\n1. At the gas/oxide interface ($x=0$), the oxidant concentration is assumed to be at its equilibrium solubility limit in the oxide, given as $C^*$. So, $C(0) = C^*$.\n2. At the oxide/silicon interface ($x=x_{\\text{ox}}$), the oxidant flux arriving at the interface is consumed by the reaction that forms new oxide. The problem states this is a first-order reaction with rate constant $k_s$. Therefore, the flux consumed is proportional to the oxidant concentration at the interface, $C_i \\equiv C(x_{\\text{ox}})$. The flux continuity condition requires that the diffusive flux equals the reaction flux:\n$$J = k_s C_i \\implies C_i = \\frac{J}{k_s}$$\n\nSubstituting these boundary conditions, $C(0)=C^*$ and $C(x_{\\text{ox}})=C_i=J/k_s$, into the integrated Fick's law:\n$$J x_{\\text{ox}} = D \\left( C^* - \\frac{J}{k_s} \\right)$$\nWe can now solve this algebraic equation for the flux $J$:\n$$J x_{\\text{ox}} + \\frac{D}{k_s} J = D C^*$$\n$$J \\left( x_{\\text{ox}} + \\frac{D}{k_s} \\right) = D C^*$$\n$$J = \\frac{D C^*}{x_{\\text{ox}} + D/k_s}$$\n\nThe problem provides the relationship between the oxidant flux $J$ and the rate of oxide growth $\\mathrm{d}x_{\\text{ox}}/\\mathrm{d}t$:\n$$N_1 \\frac{\\mathrm{d}x_{\\text{ox}}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = J$$\nwhere $N_1$ is the number of oxidant molecules incorporated into a unit volume of oxide. Substituting our expression for $J$ yields the differential equation for $x_{\\text{ox}}(t)$:\n$$N_1 \\frac{\\mathrm{d}x_{\\text{ox}}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{D C^*}{x_{\\text{ox}} + D/k_s}$$\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x_{\\text{ox}}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{D C^*/N_1}{x_{\\text{ox}} + D/k_s}$$\n\nThis equation is conventionally expressed in terms of the Deal-Grove rate constants $A$ and $B$. Let's define them based on their standard forms:\nThe parabolic rate constant is $B = \\frac{2 D C^*}{N_1}$.\nThe linear rate constant is given by the ratio $B/A = \\frac{k_s C^*}{N_1}$.\nFrom these definitions, we can find an expression for $A$:\n$$A = \\frac{B}{B/A} = \\frac{2 D C^* / N_1}{k_s C^* / N_1} = \\frac{2D}{k_s}$$\nUsing these definitions, we can express the terms in our growth rate equation:\n$D C^* / N_1 = B/2$\n$D/k_s = A/2$\n\nSubstituting these into the differential equation gives the standard form of the Deal-Grove model:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x_{\\text{ox}}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{B/2}{x_{\\text{ox}} + A/2} = \\frac{B}{2x_{\\text{ox}} + A}$$\nThis is the governing equation for the instantaneous growth rate.\n\nTo solve for $x_{\\text{ox}}(t)$, we separate variables and integrate, using the initial condition $x_{\\text{ox}}(0)=0$:\n$$\\int_{0}^{x_{\\text{ox}}} (2x'_{\\text{ox}} + A) \\, \\mathrm{d}x'_{\\text{ox}} = \\int_{0}^{t} B \\, \\mathrm{d}t'$$\n$$\\left[ (x'_{\\text{ox}})^2 + A x'_{\\text{ox}} \\right]_0^{x_{\\text{ox}}} = [Bt']_0^t$$\n$$x_{\\text{ox}}^2(t) + A x_{\\text{ox}}(t) = Bt$$\nThis is the implicit solution for the oxide thickness as a function of time.\n\nThe problem asks for the analysis of the long-time, diffusion-limited regime. This regime occurs when the oxide is thick, which happens at large times $t \\to \\infty$. In this limit, $x_{\\text{ox}}$ becomes large. In the growth rate equation $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x_{\\text{ox}}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{B}{2x_{\\text{ox}} + A}$, the term $2x_{\\text{ox}}$ dominates the constant $A$ in the denominator. This corresponds to the growth being limited by diffusion through the thick oxide layer, hence \"diffusion-limited\".\nThus, for large $t$, the growth rate is asymptotically given by:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x_{\\text{ox}}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\approx \\frac{B}{2x_{\\text{ox}}}$$\nThis is the asymptotic differential equation. To find the time dependence of the growth rate, we first need the time dependence of the thickness $x_{\\text{ox}}(t)$ in this regime. From the integrated form $x_{\\text{ox}}^2 + A x_{\\text{ox}} = Bt$, for large $t$, the term $Bt$ is large. To balance the equation, $x_{\\text{ox}}$ must also be large. In this case, the $x_{\\text{ox}}^2$ term will dominate the $Ax_{\\text{ox}}$ term. The asymptotic relationship is:\n$$x_{\\text{ox}}^2(t) \\approx Bt \\implies x_{\\text{ox}}(t) \\approx \\sqrt{Bt}$$\nThis is the characteristic parabolic growth law for the diffusion-limited regime.\n\nNow, we substitute this asymptotic expression for $x_{\\text{ox}}(t)$ back into the asymptotic expression for the growth rate:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x_{\\text{ox}}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\approx \\frac{B}{2(\\sqrt{Bt})} = \\frac{B}{2\\sqrt{B}\\sqrt{t}}$$\nSimplifying this expression gives the leading-order asymptotic behavior of the instantaneous growth rate as a function of time:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x_{\\text{ox}}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\approx \\frac{\\sqrt{B}}{2\\sqrt{t}}$$\nThis shows that in the long-time, diffusion-limited regime, the growth rate decays with time as $t^{-1/2}$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires a multistep analysis of the Deal-Grove model for thermal oxidation of silicon. This involves deriving the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE), integrating it to find the thickness-time relationship, linearizing the result for parameter extraction, and implementing a numerical fitting procedure. The problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Growth Rate Differential Equation\n\nThe model considers one-dimensional diffusion of an oxidant through an existing silicon dioxide ($SiO_2$) layer of thickness $x(t)$ to react at the silicon-silicon dioxide ($Si$-$SiO_2$) interface.\n\n1.  **Oxidant Flux from Diffusion:** Fick's first law of diffusion in one dimension states that the flux $J$ is proportional to the concentration gradient:\n    $$J = -D \\frac{dC}{dy}$$\n    where $D$ is the diffusivity of the oxidant in the oxide, and $C(y)$ is the oxidant concentration at a position $y$ within the oxide ($0 \\le y \\le x$). The problem assumes a quasi-steady linear concentration profile. Given the boundary conditions $C(y=0) = C^*$ (the equilibrium concentration at the gas-oxide surface) and $C(y=x) = C_i$ (the concentration at the $Si$-$SiO_2$ interface), the linear gradient is constant:\n    $$\\frac{dC}{dy} = \\frac{C(x) - C(0)}{x - 0} = \\frac{C_i - C^*}{x}$$\n    Substituting this into Fick's law gives the flux of oxidant arriving at the interface:\n    $$J = -D \\left(\\frac{C_i - C^*}{x}\\right) = D \\frac{C^* - C_i}{x}$$\n\n2.  **Oxidant Flux from Reaction:** The problem specifies a first-order interfacial reaction, meaning the rate of consumption of the oxidant is proportional to its concentration at the interface, $C_i$. The flux consumed by the reaction is:\n    $$J = k_s C_i$$\n    where $k_s$ is the interfacial reaction rate constant.\n\n3.  **Quasi-Steady State Assumption:** Under the quasi-steady state assumption, the diffusion flux to the interface equals the reaction flux at the interface. Equating the two expressions for $J$:\n    $$D \\frac{C^* - C_i}{x} = k_s C_i$$\n    We can solve this for the unknown interface concentration, $C_i$:\n    $$D C^* - D C_i = k_s x C_i$$\n    $$D C^* = C_i (D + k_s x)$$\n    $$C_i = \\frac{D C^*}{D + k_s x}$$\n\n4.  **Oxide Growth Rate:** The rate of oxide growth, $dx/dt$, is proportional to the oxidant flux arriving at the interface. This relationship is defined by $N_1$, the number of oxidant molecules incorporated into a unit volume of oxide:\n    $$\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{J}{N_1}$$\n    Substituting the expression for $J = k_s C_i$ and then the expression for $C_i$:\n    $$\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{k_s C_i}{N_1} = \\frac{k_s}{N_1} \\left( \\frac{D C^*}{D + k_s x} \\right)$$\n    This can be expressed as the requested rational function of $x$:\n    $$\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{k_s D C^*}{N_1 (D + k_s x)}$$\n    This is the first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation for the oxide thickness $x(t)$.\n\n### Part 2: Integration and the Time Offset $\\tau$\n\nTo integrate the ODE, it is conventional to define the Deal-Grove rate constants. Let the parabolic rate constant be $B = \\frac{2DC^*}{N_1}$ and a related constant be $A = \\frac{2D}{k_s}$. The linear rate constant is typically given by $B/A = k_s C^*/N_1$. Using $A$ and $B$, the ODE can be rewritten as:\n$$\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{B/A}{1 + 2x/A} = \\frac{B/A}{(A+2x)/A} = \\frac{B}{2x + A}$$\nTo solve this ODE, we separate variables:\n$$(2x + A) dx = B dt$$\nWe integrate this equation from the initial condition $(t=0, x=x_0)$ to a later state $(t, x(t))$:\n$$\\int_{x_0}^{x} (2x' + A) dx' = \\int_{0}^{t} B dt'$$\n$$[x'^2 + Ax']_{x_0}^{x} = [Bt']_{0}^{t}$$\n$$(x^2 + Ax) - (x_0^2 + Ax_0) = Bt$$\nRearranging this gives the well-known integrated form of the Deal-Grove model:\n$$x^2 + Ax = B t + (x_0^2 + Ax_0)$$\nThis equation can be written more compactly as $x^2 + Ax = B(t + \\tau)$, where the effective time offset, $\\tau$, is defined as:\n$$\\tau = \\frac{x_0^2 + Ax_0}{B}$$\n**Physical Meaning of $\\tau$**: The parameter $\\tau$ represents the time that would have been required, under the same oxidation conditions, to grow the pre-existing oxide layer of thickness $x_0$ starting from a bare silicon surface ($x=0$). It effectively shifts the time origin of the process to account for the initial oxide.\n**Influence of not including $\\tau$**: If one attempts to fit experimental data $(t_j, x_j)$ from a sample with a non-zero initial thickness $x_0$ to the simplified model $x^2 + Ax = Bt$ (which implicitly assumes $\\tau=0$), the model is misspecified. The term $B\\tau = x_0^2 + Ax_0$ is a non-zero intercept in the relationship between $x^2+Ax$ and $t$. Forcing this intercept to be zero during parameter extraction will lead to systematic errors in the determined values of $A$ and $B$, which will no longer accurately reflect the underlying physical rate constants.\n\n### Part 3: Linear Regression Model and Parameter Extraction\n\nThe integrated form of the Deal-Grove model, $x^2 + Ax = B(t + \\tau)$, can be rearranged for linear regression.\n$$x^2 + Ax = Bt + B\\tau$$\n$$x^2 = -Ax + Bt + B\\tau$$\nAs requested, we define the regression variables $y = x^2$, $u = -x$, and $v = t$. The target linear model is $y = \\alpha u + \\beta v + \\gamma$. Substituting the variables into this model gives:\n$$x^2 = \\alpha(-x) + \\beta(t) + \\gamma \\implies x^2 = -\\alpha x + \\beta t + \\gamma$$\nBy comparing this regression equation term-by-term with the physical equation $x^2 = -Ax + Bt + B\\tau$, we can identify the relationships between the regression coefficients $(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma)$ and the physical parameters $(A, B, \\tau)$:\n-   Comparing the terms linear in $x$: $-A = -\\alpha \\implies A = \\alpha$.\n-   Comparing the terms linear in $t$: $B = \\beta$.\n-   Comparing the constant terms (intercepts): $B\\tau = \\gamma$.\n\nFrom a linear least squares fit that yields the coefficients $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$, we can extract the physical parameters as follows:\n1.  **Linear Rate Constant Parameter $A$**: This is directly obtained from the regression coefficient $\\alpha$.\n    $$A = \\alpha$$\n    The units of $y=x^2$ are $\\mathrm{nm}^2$ and the units of $u=-x$ are $\\mathrm{nm}$. For the term $\\alpha u$ to have units of $\\mathrm{nm}^2$, $\\alpha$ must have units of $\\mathrm{nm}$.\n\n2.  **Parabolic Rate Constant $B$**: This is directly obtained from the regression coefficient $\\beta$.\n    $$B = \\beta$$\n    The units of $y=x^2$ are $\\mathrm{nm}^2$ and the units of $v=t$ are $\\mathrm{min}$. For the term $\\beta v$ to have units of $\\mathrm{nm}^2$, $\\beta$ must have units of $\\mathrm{nm}^2/\\mathrm{min}$.\n\n3.  **Effective Time Offset $\\tau$**: This is obtained from $\\gamma$ and the now-known $B$.\n    $$\\tau = \\frac{\\gamma}{B} = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta}$$\n    The constant term $\\gamma$ has the same units as $y$, which is $\\mathrm{nm}^2$.

This practice challenges you to build a robust numerical integrator that can solve the growth rate equation, $\\mathrm{d}x/\\mathrm{d}t = B/(2x + A)$, from first principles. You will explore the concept of numerical stiffness, which changes as the oxide grows, and implement an adaptive algorithm that adjusts its step size to maintain accuracy and efficiency—a cornerstone of modern computational process modeling .",

            "problem": "A silicon wafer undergoing thermal oxidation is modeled under the standard assumptions of the Deal-Grove framework: quasi-steady diffusion of oxidant through the oxide, first-order interfacial reaction at the silicon-oxide boundary, and a constant supply of oxidant at the gas-oxide interface. From conservation of species and Fick's law for diffusion, together with interfacial reaction kinetics, the thickness of silicon dioxide evolves in time as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) of the form $\\mathrm{d}x/\\mathrm{d}t = B/(2x + A)$, where $x$ is the oxide thickness, and $A$ (a length) and $B$ (a length-squared per unit time) are positive constants that depend on temperature, ambient, and material properties. You must design and implement a robust numerical integrator that advances $x(t)$ over a finite interval $[0,T]$ for given parameters $\\{x_0, A, B, T\\}$, maintaining accuracy for both small $x$ (early-time, near-linear regime) and large $x$ (late-time, parabolic regime). Justify your time step selection in terms of stiffness considerations arising from the local sensitivity of the right-hand side to $x$.\n\nYour integrator must:\n- Respect monotonicity and non-negativity of $x(t)$ for all time.\n- Adapt its time step $\\Delta t$ to control local error based on the local sensitivity of $f(x) = B/(2x + A)$, and ensure numerical stability in regimes where the effective stiffness is high (small $x$).\n- Produce the final oxide thickness $x(T)$ in nanometers.\n\nPhysical units:\n- $x$ and $A$ must be in nanometers ($\\mathrm{nm}$).\n- $B$ must be in square nanometers per second ($\\mathrm{nm}^2/\\mathrm{s}$).\n- $t$ and $T$ must be in seconds ($\\mathrm{s}$).\n\nAngle units are not involved in this problem. Percentages, if any appear in reasoning, must be expressed as decimals.\n\nTest Suite:\nCompute the final oxide thickness $x(T)$ for the following parameter sets. Each parameter set is given as $(x_0, A, B, T)$ with units specified for each quantity as above.\n\n- Case $1$ (happy path, moderate dry oxidation): $(x_0, A, B, T) = (1\\,\\mathrm{nm}, 30\\,\\mathrm{nm}, 0.001\\,\\mathrm{nm}^2/\\mathrm{s}, 36000\\,\\mathrm{s})$.\n- Case $2$ (small initial thickness, faster wet oxidation): $(x_0, A, B, T) = (0\\,\\mathrm{nm}, 15\\,\\mathrm{nm}, 0.02\\,\\mathrm{nm}^2/\\mathrm{s}, 1800\\,\\mathrm{s})$.\n- Case $3$ (large initial thickness, slow further growth): $(x_0, A, B, T) = (1000\\,\\mathrm{nm}, 30\\,\\mathrm{nm}, 0.001\\,\\mathrm{nm}^2/\\mathrm{s}, 36000\\,\\mathrm{s})$.\n- Case $4$ (near-linear regime with small $A$): $(x_0, A, B, T) = (0\\,\\mathrm{nm}, 1\\,\\mathrm{nm}, 0.01\\,\\mathrm{nm}^2/\\mathrm{s}, 10\\,\\mathrm{s})$.\n- Case $5$ (very long oxidation time, large parabolic contribution): $(x_0, A, B, T) = (0\\,\\mathrm{nm}, 20\\,\\mathrm{nm}, 0.05\\,\\mathrm{nm}^2/\\mathrm{s}, 1000000\\,\\mathrm{s})$.\n\nAnswer specification:\n- For each test case, compute the single float $x(T)$ in $\\mathrm{nm}$.\n- Round each result to $6$ decimal places.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the same order as the test cases, for example, $[x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5]$ where each $x_i$ is a float in $\\mathrm{nm}$ rounded to $6$ decimal places.\n\nNo shortcut formulas or intermediate results are provided; your implementation must be justified from fundamental principles and sound numerical analysis.

            "solution": "The problem requires the design and implementation of a robust numerical integrator for the Deal-Grove model of thermal oxidation, described by the ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{B}{2x + A} $$\nwhere $x(t)$ is the oxide thickness, and $A$ and $B$ are positive constants. The initial condition is $x(0) = x_0$. The integrator must be accurate for both small $x$ (reaction-limited, linear growth regime) and large $x$ (diffusion-limited, parabolic growth regime), and must adapt its time step based on local error and stability considerations.\n\n### Analysis of the Governing Equation\n\nThe function on the right-hand side, $f(x) = B/(2x + A)$, dictates the growth rate of the oxide. Since $B > 0$, $A > 0$, and the physical thickness $x(t)$ must be non-negative, the growth rate $dx/dt$ is always positive. This ensures that $x(t)$ is a strictly monotonically increasing function of time $t$. Any valid numerical scheme must preserve this property.\n\nWe can identify two distinct asymptotic regimes:\n1.  **Linear Regime ($2x \\ll A$):** At the beginning of oxidation, or if the oxide is thin, the growth rate is approximately constant: $\\frac{dx}{dt} \\approx \\frac{B}{A}$. The thickness grows linearly with time: $x(t) \\approx x_0 + (B/A)t$. This regime is limited by the reaction rate at the silicon-oxide interface.\n2.  **Parabolic Regime ($2x \\gg A$):** For thick oxides, the growth rate becomes inversely proportional to the thickness: $\\frac{dx}{dt} \\approx \\frac{B}{2x}$. Separating variables ($2x\\,dx \\approx B\\,dt$) and integrating leads to $x^2 \\approx x_0^2 + Bt$. The thickness grows as the square root of time: $x(t) \\propto \\sqrt{t}$. This regime is limited by the diffusion of the oxidant species through the existing oxide layer.\n\n### Numerical Stability and Stiffness Considerations\n\nThe problem mandates a time step selection justified by stiffness analysis. The \"stiffness\" of a scalar ODE $dx/dt = f(x)$ is related to the magnitude of the derivative of the right-hand side function, which is the scalar equivalent of an eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix.\n$$ \\lambda(x) = \\frac{df}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{B}{2x + A}\\right) = -B \\frac{2}{(2x + A)^2} = \\frac{-2B}{(2x + A)^2} $$\nFor an explicit numerical method, such as Forward Euler, to be stable, the time step $\\Delta t$ must satisfy the condition $|\\lambda(x) \\Delta t| < C$, where $C$ is a constant characteristic of the method (e.g., $C=2$ for Forward Euler). This imposes a stability constraint on the time step:\n$$ \\Delta t < \\frac{C}{|\\lambda(x)|} = C \\frac{(2x + A)^2}{2B} $$\nThe magnitude of $\\lambda(x)$ is largest when $x$ is smallest (i.e., at the start of the integration, $x=x_0$). This is the \"stiffest\" region of the problem, demanding the smallest time steps for stability. As $x$ grows, $|\\lambda(x)|$ decreases rapidly, the ODE becomes less stiff, and larger time steps are permissible. An adaptive integrator is therefore essential for efficiency, as it can take small steps in the initial stiff regime and larger steps in the later, non-stiff regime.\n\n### Choice of Numerical Integrator and Adaptive Scheme\n\nTo satisfy the requirements of accuracy and robustness, a second-order Runge-Kutta method (RK2), specifically Heun's method, is an excellent choice. It provides a good balance between accuracy (second-order) and computational cost, and is a significant improvement over the first-order Forward Euler method.\n\nTo adapt the time step $\\Delta t$, we will use the method of step doubling to estimate the local truncation error (LTE). For a method of order $p$, we perform one step of size $\\Delta t$ to get an estimate $x_{n+1}^{(1)}$, and two steps of size $\\Delta t/2$ to get a more accurate estimate $x_{n+1}^{(2)}$. The error in the more accurate solution, $x_{n+1}^{(2)}$, can be estimated as:\n$$ E \\approx \\frac{|x_{n+1}^{(2)} - x_{n+1}^{(1)}|}{2^p - 1} $$\nFor Heun's method, the order is $p=2$, so the error estimate is $E \\approx \\frac{1}{3}|x_{n+1}^{(2)} - x_{n+1}^{(1)}|$.\n\n### Adaptive Step Size Control Algorithm\n\nThe integrator will implement the following adaptive control logic at each step, from time $t_n$ to $t_{n+1}$:\n1.  **Propose a step:** Start with a current time step size $\\Delta t$.\n2.  **Compute two estimates:**\n    -   Calculate $x_{n+1}^{(1)}$ using one step of Heun's method with size $\\Delta t$.\n    -   Calculate $x_{n+1}^{(2)}$ using two successive steps of Heun's method, each with size $\\Delta t/2$.\n3.  **Estimate error:** Calculate the error estimate $E$ using the formula above.\n4.  **Define tolerance:** The target accuracy for the step is defined by a combination of an absolute tolerance ($atol$) and a relative tolerance ($rtol$): $S = atol + rtol \\cdot |x_{n+1}^{(2)}|$.\n5.  **Accept or reject step:**\n    -   If $E \\le S$, the step is accepted. The solution is advanced to $x_{n+1} = x_{n+1}^{(2)}$ and time is advanced by $\\Delta t$.\n    -   If $E > S$, the step is rejected. The solution $x_n$ and time $t_n$ are unchanged.\n6.  **Update step size:** In either case, a new step size for the next attempt is calculated to better match the tolerance. A common and robust formula is:\n    $$ \\Delta t_{\\text{new}} = q \\cdot \\Delta t \\cdot \\left(\\frac{S}{E}\\right)^{1/(p+1)} $$\n    where $q$ is a safety factor (e.g., $q=0.9$) and $p=2$ for our method. If the step was accepted, this new $\\Delta t_{\\text{new}}$ will be used for the next step from $t_{n+1}$. If the step was rejected, the current step is retried with this smaller $\\Delta t_{\\text{new}}$. To prevent overly aggressive changes, the ratio $\\Delta t_{\\text{new}}/\\Delta t$ is typically clipped to a predefined range.\n\nThis algorithm directly addresses the problem's requirements. It adapts the time step to control local error. This error-based adaptation naturally forces smaller steps when the solution's curvature is high, which for this problem corresponds to the stiff regime at small $x$. Thus, the method remains stable and accurate across the entire integration domain. The implementation will use this adaptive RK2 integrator to find the final oxide thickness $x(T)$ for each test case.",
