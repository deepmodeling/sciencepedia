According to the problem statement, the rate is proportional to an exponential term involving the activation free energy $\\Delta G^{\\dagger}$. We can write this as:\n$$\nR = C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\dagger}}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of proportionality that depends on factors such as reactant concentration but is independent of stress.\n\nThe activation free energy $\\Delta G^{\\dagger}$ is a function of the hydrostatic compressive stress $\\sigma$:\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\dagger}(\\sigma) = \\Delta G^{\\dagger}(0) + \\Omega \\sigma\n$$\nHere, $\\Delta G^{\\dagger}(0)$ is the activation free energy at zero stress ($\\sigma=0$). Substituting this expression into the rate equation gives the stress-dependent reaction rate, $R(\\sigma)$:\n$$\nR(\\sigma) = C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\dagger}(0) + \\Omega \\sigma}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the property of exponents, $\\exp(a+b) = \\exp(a)\\exp(b)$, we can separate the terms:\n$$\nR(\\sigma) = C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\dagger}(0)}{k_{B}T}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Omega \\sigma}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nThe reaction rate at zero stress, $R(0)$, is obtained by setting $\\sigma=0$:\n$$\nR(0) = C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\dagger}(0)}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nBy substituting $R(0)$ back into the equation for $R(\\sigma)$, we obtain a simplified relationship between the rate at stress $\\sigma$ and the rate at zero stress:\n$$\nR(\\sigma) = R(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Omega \\sigma}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem requires finding the stress $\\sigma^{*}$ at which the reaction rate is reduced to one-half of its zero-stress value. This condition is formally expressed as:\n$$\nR(\\sigma^{*}) = \\frac{1}{2} R(0)\n$$\nSubstituting our expression for $R(\\sigma^{*})$:\n$$\nR(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Omega \\sigma^{*}}{k_{B}T}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} R(0)\n$$\nSince $R(0)$ is a non-zero rate, we can divide both sides by $R(0)$:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Omega \\sigma^{*}}{k_{B}T}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nTo solve for $\\sigma^{*}$, we take the natural logarithm ($\\ln$) of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left[\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Omega \\sigma^{*}}{k_{B}T}\\right)\\right] = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{\\Omega \\sigma^{*}}{k_{B}T} = -\\ln(2)\n$$\nMultiplying by $-1$ on both sides yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Omega \\sigma^{*}}{k_{B}T} = \\ln(2)\n$$\nFinally, we isolate $\\sigma^{*}$ to obtain the general symbolic condition:\n$$\n\\sigma^{*} = \\frac{k_{B} T \\ln(2)}{\\Omega}\n$$\nThis expression provides the hydrostatic compressive stress required to halve the interface reaction rate.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value for $\\sigma^{*}$ using the provided data:\n$T = 1150\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n$\\Omega = 1.9 \\times 10^{-29}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}$\n$k_{B} = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$\n\\sigma^{*} = \\frac{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (1150\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\times \\ln(2)}{1.9 \\times 10^{-29}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}}\n$$\nFirst, calculate the thermal energy term $k_{B}T$:\n$$\nk_{B}T = (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}) \\times 1150 \\approx 1.58774635 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{J}\n$$\nNext, multiply by $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.69314718$:\n$$\nk_{B}T\\ln(2) \\approx (1.58774635 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{J}) \\times 0.69314718 \\approx 1.10041 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{J}\n$$\nNow, divide by the activation volume $\\Omega$:\n$$\n\\sigma^{*} \\approx \\frac{1.10041 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{J}}{1.9 \\times 10^{-29}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}} \\approx 5.7916 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-3}}\n$$\nThe unit $\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-3}}$ is equivalent to $\\mathrm{N\\,m\\,m^{-3}} = \\mathrm{N\\,m^{-2}}$, which is the Pascal ($\\mathrm{Pa}$), the SI unit of pressure and stress.

The film's mechanical behavior is described by a Maxwell element, which consists of a linear elastic spring and a Newtonian dashpot connected in series. The analysis proceeds from the fundamental principles governing this model under the specified boundary condition of constant total strain.\n\nLet $\\sigma(t)$ be the in-plane equi-biaxial stress in the film at time $t$ during the anneal.
