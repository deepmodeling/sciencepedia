            "problem": "You are modeling radiative heat transfer in a Rapid Thermal Annealing (RTA) enclosure comprising three ($3$) opaque, gray, diffuse surfaces: a lamp array surface ($1$), a silicon wafer ($2$), and a concave reflector ($3$). The enclosure contains no participating medium (vacuum or noble gas), and all surfaces are isothermal. The goal is to compute the net radiative heat flux into the wafer surface using the radiosity method, starting from fundamental radiative transfer principles.\n\nStarting from first principles, use the following bases:\n- The Stefan–Boltzmann law for blackbody emission: a surface at absolute temperature $T_i$ emits thermal radiation power per unit area $\\sigma T_i^4$, where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant.\n- The definition of radiosity for a diffuse-gray opaque surface: the total outward radiative flux from surface $i$ stems from emitted and reflected components.\n- Energy conservation for radiative exchange in an enclosure: irradiation received by a surface arises from the radiosities of all surfaces weighted by view factors.\n- View factor properties in a closed enclosure: reciprocity and conservation hold, i.e., $A_i F_{ij} = A_j F_{ji}$ and $\\sum_j F_{ij} = 1$ for each $i$.\n\nYou must:\n- Formulate the enclosure radiosity equations from these bases without invoking any shortcut formulas.\n- Assemble and solve the resulting linear system for the radiosities.\n- Compute the net radiative heat flux into the wafer as the irradiation minus radiosity for the wafer surface.\n\nUse the following geometric and radiative parameters, which are scientifically consistent with an RTA lamp–wafer–reflector enclosure:\n- Surface areas in $\\mathrm{m^2}$: $A_1 = 0.06$, $A_2 = \\pi (0.10)^2 \\approx 0.0314159$, $A_3 = 0.30$.\n- View factor matrix $F$ meeting reciprocity and conservation:\n  - $F_{11} = 0$, $F_{12} = 0.30$, $F_{13} = 0.70$,\n  - $F_{21} = 0.573$, $F_{22} = 0$, $F_{23} = 0.427$,\n  - $F_{31} = 0.14$, $F_{32} = 0.0447$, $F_{33} = 0.8153$.\n- Stefan–Boltzmann constant: $\\sigma = 5.670374419 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-4}}$.\n\nImplement a program that, for each test case, constructs and solves the radiosity system and returns the wafer’s net radiative heat flux into the wafer, defined as $q_{2,\\text{in}} = H_2 - J_2$, in $\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$.

            "solution": "The user-provided problem statement has been critically validated and is deemed valid. The problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of radiative heat transfer, well-posed with a complete and consistent set of parameters, and objective in its formulation. The provided view factors satisfy the summation and reciprocity rules for a closed enclosure, within acceptable rounding tolerances. The physical parameters are consistent with the application context of Rapid Thermal Annealing (RTA). We now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute the net radiative heat flux into a silicon wafer (surface $2$) within a three-surface enclosure, comprising a lamp array (surface $1$), the wafer (surface $2$), and a reflector (surface $3$). All surfaces are treated as opaque, diffuse, and gray, and are held at constant, uniform temperatures. The analysis will be conducted using the radiosity method, derived from first principles.\n\n**1. Formulation of Radiosity Equations from First Principles**\n\nThe analysis is based on the following fundamental principles of radiative heat transfer for an enclosure of $N$ surfaces (here, $N=3$).\n\n**Principle A: Radiosity Definition**\nThe radiosity, $J_i$ ($ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}} $), of a surface $i$ is the total radiative flux leaving the surface. For an opaque, diffuse-gray surface, it is the sum of its emitted radiation and the reflected portion of the incident radiation (irradiation, $H_i$).\n\n$$J_i = E_{i, \\text{emitted}} + E_{i, \\text{reflected}}$$\n\nThe emitted component is determined by the surface's emissivity, $\\varepsilon_i$, and its blackbody emissive power, $E_{b,i}$, which is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law as $E_{b,i} = \\sigma T_i^4$, where $T_i$ is the absolute temperature of surface $i$ and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Thus, $E_{i, \\text{emitted}} = \\varepsilon_i E_{b,i} = \\varepsilon_i \\sigma T_i^4$.\n\nThe reflected component is given by $E_{i, \\text{reflected}} = \\rho_i H_i$, where $\\rho_i$ is the surface reflectivity. For an opaque surface, the sum of absorptivity ($\\alpha_i$) and reflectivity is unity: $\\alpha_i + \\rho_i = 1$. For a gray surface, emissivity equals absorptivity: $\\varepsilon_i = \\alpha_i$. Therefore, the reflectivity is $\\rho_i = 1 - \\varepsilon_i$.\n\nCombining these, the radiosity equation for surface $i$ is:\n$$J_i = \\varepsilon_i E_{b,i} + (1 - \\varepsilon_i) H_i \\quad (*)$$\n\n**Principle B: Irradiation and View Factors**\nThe irradiation, $H_i$ ($ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}} $), on surface $i$ is the total radiative flux incident upon it from all surfaces in the enclosure. The portion of radiation leaving surface $j$ that arrives at surface $i$ is quantified by the view factor $F_{ji}$. The total rate of energy arriving at surface $i$ is the sum of contributions from all $N$ surfaces: $\\sum_{j=1}^{N} (A_j J_j) F_{ji}$, where $A_j$ is the area of surface $j$. The irradiation flux on surface $i$ is this total rate divided by its own area, $A_i$:\n\n$$H_i = \\frac{1}{A_i} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} A_j J_j F_{ji}$$\n\nUsing the view factor reciprocity rule, $A_j F_{ji} = A_i F_{ij}$, we can simplify the expression for irradiation:\n\n$$H_i = \\frac{1}{A_i} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} A_i F_{ij} J_j = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} F_{ij} J_j \\quad (**)$$\n\n**2. Assembly of the Linear System**\n\nWe now have a system of equations relating the unknown radiosities ($J_i$) and irradiations ($H_i$). To solve for the radiosities, we eliminate the irradiations. By substituting equation $(**)$ into equation $(*)$, we obtain a set of equations solely in terms of the radiosities $J_j$:\n\n$$J_i = \\varepsilon_i E_{b,i} + (1 - \\varepsilon_i) \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{N} F_{ij} J_j \\right)$$\n\nThis equation can be rearranged into a standard linear system form. Distributing the term $(1 - \\varepsilon_i)$ and moving all terms involving $J_j$ to the left-hand side gives:\n\n$$J_i - (1 - \\varepsilon_i) \\sum_{j=1}^{N} F_{ij} J_j = \\varepsilon_i E_{b,i}$$\n\nWe can express the term $J_i$ using the Kronecker delta, $\\delta_{ij}$, as $\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\delta_{ij} J_j$, where $\\delta_{ij} = 1$ if $i=j$ and $0$ otherwise. This allows us to combine the sums:\n\n$$\\sum_{j=1}^{N} (\\delta_{ij} - (1 - \\varepsilon_i)F_{ij}) J_j = \\varepsilon_i E_{b,i}$$\n\nFor our $N=3$ surface enclosure, this represents a $3 \\times 3$ system of linear algebraic equations, which can be written in matrix form as $\\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{J} = \\mathbf{C}$, where:\n- $\\mathbf{J} = \\begin{bmatrix} J_1 \\\\ J_2 \\\\ J_3 \\end{bmatrix}$ is the column vector of unknown radiosities.\n- $\\mathbf{M}$ is the $3 \\times 3$ coefficient matrix with elements $M_{ij} = \\delta_{ij} - (1 - \\varepsilon_i) F_{ij}$.\n- $\\mathbf{C}$ is the column vector of constants with elements $C_i = \\varepsilon_i E_{b,i} = \\varepsilon_i \\sigma T_i^4$.\n\nExplicitly, the system is:\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 - (1-\\varepsilon_1)F_{11} & -(1-\\varepsilon_1)F_{12} & -(1-\\varepsilon_1)F_{13} \\\\\n-(1-\\varepsilon_2)F_{21} & 1 - (1-\\varepsilon_2)F_{22} & -(1-\\varepsilon_2)F_{23} \\\\\n-(1-\\varepsilon_3)F_{31} & -(1-\\varepsilon_3)F_{32} & 1 - (1-\\varepsilon_3)F_{33}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix} J_1 \\\\ J_2 \\\\ J_3 \\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix} \\varepsilon_1 \\sigma T_1^4 \\\\ \\varepsilon_2 \\sigma T_2^4 \\\\ \\varepsilon_3 \\sigma T_3^4 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThis system can be solved for the vector $\\mathbf{J}$ using standard linear algebra techniques.\n\n**3. Computation of Net Heat Flux**\n\nThe problem requires the net radiative heat flux *into* the wafer (surface $2$), which we denote as $q_{2,\\text{in}}$. The net flux *leaving* a surface is the difference between its radiosity and its irradiation, $q_{i,\\text{out}} = J_i - H_i$. The flux into the surface is the negative of this quantity:\n\n$$q_{i,\\text{in}} = H_i - J_i$$\n\nFor the wafer (surface $2$), we need to calculate $q_{2,\\text{in}} = H_2 - J_2$.\nAfter solving the linear system for the radiosity vector $\\mathbf{J}$, we have the value of $J_2$. The irradiation on the wafer, $H_2$, is then calculated using equation $(**)$:\n\n$$H_2 = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} F_{2j} J_j = F_{21}J_1 + F_{22}J_2 + F_{23}J_3$$\n\nWith both $J_2$ and $H_2$ determined, the net heat flux into the wafer is computed. This procedure will be implemented for each of the five test cases provided.",

It is a scientifically grounded, well-posed problem in heat transfer, relevant to semiconductor process modeling. All necessary data are provided, and the constants are physically plausible for silicon at high temperatures.

Derivation of the in-plane thermal diffusion length $\\ell$**\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the thermal diffusion length, $\\ell$, based on the fundamental solution of the one-dimensional heat equation, $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}$. The fundamental solution, or Green's function, $G(x, t)$, describes the temperature distribution resulting from a point source of heat (a Dirac delta function, $\\delta(x)$) at position $x=0$ and time $t=0$. It is a Gaussian function:\n$$ G(x, t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi\\alpha t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{4\\alpha t}\\right) $$\nThis solution shows how heat diffuses away from the initial point source. The characteristic length scale of this diffusion process is embedded in the argument of the exponential. The term $4\\alpha t$ has dimensions of length squared. A conventional definition for the thermal diffusion length, $\\ell$, is the distance over which the diffusing quantity has spread significantly. We define $\\ell$ from the characteristic scale in the exponent, $\\ell^2 = 4\\alpha t$.\nTherefore, the thermal diffusion length over a time $t$ is:\n$$ \\ell = \\sqrt{4\\alpha t} = 2\\sqrt{\\alpha t} $$\n\n**2.

Derivation of the amplitude attenuation factor $A/A_{0}$**\n\nWe model the temperature nonuniformity as a single sinusoidal mode. Let the temperature field $T(x,t)$ be the sum of an average temperature $T_{avg}$ and a spatially varying perturbation $\\Delta T(x,t)$. The perturbation is described by the heat equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial (\\Delta T)}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 (\\Delta T)}{\\partial x^2} $$\nThe initial condition for the perturbation at $t=0$ is a sinusoid with amplitude $A_0$ and wavenumber $k_{\\lambda} = 2\\pi/\\lambda$:\n$$ \\Delta T(x, 0) = A_{0} \\sin(k_{\\lambda} x) $$\nWe seek a solution of the form $\\Delta T(x, t) = A(t) \\sin(k_{\\lambda} x)$, where $A(t)$ is the time-dependent amplitude with $A(0) = A_0$. Substituting this into the heat equation:\n$$ \\frac{d(A(t))}{dt} \\sin(k_{\\lambda} x) = \\alpha A(t) \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}[\\sin(k_{\\lambda} x)] $$\n$$ \\frac{d(A(t))}{dt} \\sin(k_{\\lambda} x) = \\alpha A(t) (-k_{\\lambda}^2 \\sin(k_{\\lambda} x)) $$\nSince $\\sin(k_{\\lambda} x)$ is not identically zero, we can divide it out, which yields an ordinary differential equation for the amplitude $A(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{d(A(t))}{dt} = -\\alpha k_{\\lambda}^2 A(t) $$\nThe solution to this first-order linear ODE with initial condition $A(0) = A_0$ is:\n$$ A(t) = A_0 \\exp(-\\alpha k_{\\lambda}^2 t) $$\nThe amplitude attenuation factor is the ratio of the amplitude at time $t$ to the initial amplitude, $A/A_0$:\n$$ \\frac{A}{A_0} = \\exp(-\\alpha k_{\\lambda}^2 t) $$\n\n**4. Computation of $A/A_{0}$ and assessment**\n\nWe are given the wavelength of the nonuniformity, $\\lambda = 50\\,\\text{mm} = 0.050\\,\\text{m}$. The corresponding wavenumber is:\n$$ k_{\\lambda} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} = \\frac{2\\pi}{0.050\\,\\text{m}} = 40\\pi \\, \\text{m}^{-1} $$\nNow we compute the attenuation factor $A/A_0$ for $t = 1\\,\\text{s}$:\n$$ \\frac{A}{A_0} = \\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{70}{2.33 \\times 10^{6}}\\right) \\times (40\\pi)^2 \\times 1\\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{A}{A_0} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{70 \\times 1600 \\pi^2}{2.33 \\times 10^{6}}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{112000 \\pi^2}{2.33 \\times 10^{6}}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0.112 \\pi^2}{2.33}\\right) $$\nUsing the value $\\pi^2 \\approx 9.8696044$:\n$$ \\frac{A}{A_0} \\approx \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0.112 \\times 9.8696044}{2.33}\\right) \\approx \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1.1053957}{2.33}\\right) \\approx \\exp(-0.47441875) $$\n$$ \\frac{A}{A_0} \\approx 0.622255 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the final answer is $0.6223$.\n\nAssessment: The amplitude of the $50\\,\\text{mm}$ wavelength nonuniformity is reduced to approximately $62.23\\%$ of its original value after $1\\,\\text{s}$. This indicates that while there is some smoothing due to lateral heat conduction, a substantial portion of the nonuniformity persists. In semiconductor manufacturing, where temperature uniformity is critical, this level of attenuation would likely not be considered \"significant smoothing\". The diffusion length ($\\ell \\approx 11\\,\\text{mm}$) is considerably smaller than the nonuniformity wavelength ($\\lambda = 50\\,\\text{mm}$), which is consistent with the incomplete attenuation.",

            "problem": "A circular silicon wafer used in Rapid Thermal Annealing (RTA) is modeled as a thin disk of radius $R$ and thickness $b$, with mass density $\\rho$, specific heat capacity $c_p$, and temperature-dependent thermal conductivity $k(T)$. The wafer is heated radiatively by lamps, and convective losses are negligible. Assume both large faces of the wafer exchange radiation with an enclosure that is near the wafer temperature so that a linearized radiative heat transfer coefficient $h_{\\text{rad}}$ is valid, with $h_{\\text{rad}}$ approximated around the process temperature $T$ by $h_{\\text{rad}} = 4 \\varepsilon \\sigma T^{3}$, where $\\varepsilon$ is the wafer emissivity and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant. \n\nStarting from the heat diffusion equation and fundamental definitions, explain the criterion under which the lumped capacitance model is valid for the wafer’s through-thickness temperature during RTA. Then, using first-principles scaling of in-plane heat diffusion during a temperature ramp at rate $\\beta = dT/dt$, derive a conservative criterion for the maximum allowable ramp rate $\\beta_{\\max}$ such that the in-plane temperature variation across the wafer remains below $\\Delta T_{\\max} = 5\\,\\text{K}$. Your derivation must use $k(T)$, $R$, $\\rho$, and $c_p$ as symbolic parameters and clearly state any assumptions.\n\nExpress the final $\\beta_{\\max}$ as a single closed-form analytic expression in $\\text{K}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, written in terms of $k(T)$, $R$, $\\rho$, and $c_p$. No numerical evaluation is required. No intermediate or additional outputs other than the final expression are permitted. The $5\\,\\text{K}$ bound must appear explicitly in your final expression.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of heat transfer, mathematically well-posed, and objective. It presents a solvable problem in semiconductor process modeling without internal contradictions or missing critical information for the requested derivation.\n\nThe problem asks for two distinct items: first, an explanation of the criterion for the validity of the lumped capacitance model in the through-thickness direction, and second, a derivation of a conservative criterion for the maximum allowable in-plane temperature ramp rate, $\\beta_{\\max}$.\n\nPart 1: Criterion for Lumped Capacitance Model\n\nThe general heat diffusion equation in cylindrical coordinates, assuming axisymmetry (no dependence on the azimuthal angle $\\phi$), is given by:\n$$\n\\rho c_p \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r k(T) \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r} \\right) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left( k(T) \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $T = T(r, z, t)$, $\\rho$ is the mass density, $c_p$ is the specific heat capacity, and $k(T)$ is the temperature-dependent thermal conductivity.\n\nThe lumped capacitance model is applicable to the heat transfer in the through-thickness (z-direction) of the wafer if the internal resistance to heat conduction is negligible compared to the external resistance to heat transfer at the surface. The ratio of these resistances forms a dimensionless quantity known as the Biot number, $Bi$. The model is considered valid when $Bi \\ll 1$.\n\nFor the through-thickness direction, the characteristic length for internal conduction is half the wafer thickness, $L_c = b/2$. The internal conductive thermal resistance per unit area is:\n$$\nR_{\\text{cond}, z} = \\frac{L_c}{k(T)} = \\frac{b}{2k(T)}\n$$\nThe external heat transfer is via radiation to the enclosure. The problem states this can be modeled using a linearized radiative heat transfer coefficient, $h_{\\text{rad}}$. The external radiative thermal resistance per unit area is:\n$$\nR_{\\text{rad}} = \\frac{1}{h_{\\text{rad}}}\n$$\nThe Biot number for the through-thickness direction, $Bi_z$, is the ratio of these resistances:\n$$\nBi_z = \\frac{R_{\\text{cond}, z}}{R_{\\text{rad}}} = \\frac{ b / (2k(T)) }{ 1 / h_{\\text{rad}} } = \\frac{h_{\\text{rad}} b}{2k(T)}\n$$\nUsing the provided approximation for the radiative heat transfer coefficient, $h_{\\text{rad}} = 4 \\varepsilon \\sigma T^3$, where $\\varepsilon$ is the emissivity and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, the Biot number becomes:\n$$\nBi_z = \\frac{(4 \\varepsilon \\sigma T^3) b}{2k(T)} = \\frac{2 \\varepsilon \\sigma T^3 b}{k(T)}\n$$\nTherefore, the criterion under which the lumped capacitance model is valid for the wafer’s through-thickness temperature is that this Biot number must be much less than unity:\n$$\n\\frac{2 \\varepsilon \\sigma T^3 b}{k(T)} \\ll 1\n$$\nThis condition ensures that the temperature gradient across the wafer's thickness is negligible, and the temperature can be considered uniform in the z-direction, i.e., $T \\approx T(r, t)$.\n\nPart 2: Derivation of the Maximum Ramp Rate $\\beta_{\\max}$\n\nWe are tasked with deriving a criterion for the maximum ramp rate, $\\beta = dT/dt$, such that the in-plane temperature variation, $\\Delta T_r$, remains below a specified maximum, $\\Delta T_{\\max} = 5\\,\\text{K}$. This requires a scaling analysis of the in-plane heat diffusion.\n\nAssuming the lumped capacitance criterion from Part 1 is met, we can average the heat equation over the wafer thickness, $b$. The energy balance equation for a thin disk with in-plane conduction is:\n$$\n\\rho c_p b \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = b \\nabla_r \\cdot (k(T) \\nabla_r T) + q''_{\\text{net}}(r, t)\n$$\nwhere $\\nabla_r$ is the gradient operator in the radial direction and $q''_{\\text{net}}$ is the net heat flux from the surfaces (incident lamp flux minus radiative losses).\n\nDuring a temperature ramp at a constant rate $\\beta$, the local temperature changes as $\\partial T / \\partial t \\approx \\beta$. The average net heat flux over the wafer surface required to sustain this ramp is given by:\n$$\n\\langle q''_{\\text{net}} \\rangle = \\rho c_p b \\beta\n$$\nIn-plane temperature variations, $\\Delta T_r$, arise from spatial non-uniformities in the net heat flux, $\\delta q''_{\\text{net}}(r) = q''_{\\text{net}}(r) - \\langle q''_{\\text{net}} \\rangle$. In a quasi-steady state during the ramp, the in-plane heat conduction acts to smooth out these variations. The governing balance is between the non-uniform heating and the lateral conduction:\n$$\n-b \\nabla_r \\cdot (k(T) \\nabla_r T) \\approx \\delta q''_{\\text{net}}(r)\n$$\nTo derive a conservative criterion, we perform a scaling analysis of this equation.\nThe characteristic length scale for in-plane diffusion is the wafer radius, $R$. The characteristic temperature variation is $\\Delta T_r$. The scaling of the left-hand side (conduction term) is:\n$$\n-b \\nabla_r \\cdot (k(T) \\nabla_r T) \\sim b k(T) \\frac{\\Delta T_r}{R^2}\n$$\nFor a conservative estimate, we must make a worst-case assumption about the non-uniformity of the heat flux, $\\delta q''_{\\text{net}}$. A standard conservative assumption in process modeling is that the magnitude of the spatial variation of the flux is on the same order of magnitude as its average value.\n$$\n\\delta q''_{\\text{net}} \\sim \\langle q''_{\\text{net}} \\rangle = \\rho c_p b \\beta\n$$\nBy equating the scaled conduction term and the scaled non-uniform flux term, we establish the relationship between the ramp rate and the resulting temperature non-uniformity:\n$$\nb k(T) \\frac{\\Delta T_r}{R^2} \\sim \\rho c_p b \\beta\n$$\nThe wafer thickness $b$ cancels from both sides of the relation. Solving for the ramp rate $\\beta$:\n$$\n\\beta \\sim \\frac{k(T) \\Delta T_r}{\\rho c_p R^2}\n$$\nThis expression relates the ramp rate to the material properties, wafer dimensions, and the in-plane temperature difference. To find the maximum allowable ramp rate, $\\beta_{\\max}$, we set the temperature variation $\\Delta T_r$ to its maximum permissible value, $\\Delta T_{\\max} = 5\\,\\text{K}$. The scaling analysis yields a relationship, and for estimation, we take the scaling prefactor to be unity, which is standard practice in such first-principles derivations.\n$$\n\\beta_{\\max} = \\frac{k(T) \\Delta T_{\\max}}{\\rho c_p R^2}\n$$\nSubstituting the given value $\\Delta T_{\\max} = 5\\,\\text{K}$:\n$$\n\\beta_{\\max} = \\frac{5 k(T)}{\\rho c_p R^2}\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytic expression for the conservative criterion for the maximum allowable ramp rate. The derivation relied on the following key assumptions:\n1.  The in-plane temperature profile is in a quasi-steady state during the ramp.\n2.  The characteristic length scale for spatial temperature gradients is the wafer radius $R$.\n3.  The spatial non-uniformity of the net heat flux is the primary cause of in-plane temperature variation.\n4.  The magnitude of the non-uniform net heat flux is conservatively estimated to be of the same order as the average net heat flux required for the temperature ramp.",
