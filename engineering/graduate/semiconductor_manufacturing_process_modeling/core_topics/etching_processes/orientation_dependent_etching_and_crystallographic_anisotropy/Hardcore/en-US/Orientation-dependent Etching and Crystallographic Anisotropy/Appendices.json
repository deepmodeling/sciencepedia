The problem requires determining the depth of a V-groove formed by anisotropic etching of a $(100)$-oriented silicon wafer. This will be solved by applying fundamental principles of crystallography and vector geometry.\n\nThe V-groove is formed by two intersecting crystallographic planes from the $\\{111\\}$ family, which act as etch stops. The surface of the wafer is the $(100)$ plane. The geometry of the groove's cross-section is determined by the angle these $\\{111\\}$ planes make with the $(100)$ surface.\n\nAccording to the principles of crystallography for a cubic crystal system, the normal vector to a plane with Miller indices $(hkl)$ is the direction vector $[h\\,k\\,l]$.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a clear, self-contained description of a standard problem in the modeling of anisotropic crystal etching, with all necessary parameters and definitions for a unique, verifiable solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is to model the evolution of a shape defined by a polar function $r(\\theta, t)$ and to characterize its emergent symmetry. The solution proceeds by first deriving the analytical form of the evolved shape, then specifying the numerical algorithm to compute the required metrics.\n\n**1. Analytical Model of Shape Evolution**\n\nThe evolution of the etched profile is governed by the local normal velocity $v_n(\\theta)$, which is given as being equal to the orientation-dependent etch rate $R(\\theta)$. For a star-shaped boundary parameterized by the polar function $r(\\theta, t)$, under the assumption of negligible curvature effects, the radial function's rate of change is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial r(\\theta,t)}{\\partial t} = v_n(\\theta) = R(\\theta)\n$$\nThe etch rate $R(\\theta)$ is modeled as a periodic function of the angle $\\theta$:\n$$\nR(\\theta) = R_0\\left[1 + \\varepsilon \\cos\\!\\big(k(\\theta - \\theta_0)\\big)\\right]\n$$\nHere, $R_0 > 0$ is the baseline etch rate, $\\varepsilon \\in [0,1)$ is the anisotropy strength, $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$ is the symmetry order (e.g., $k=4$ for fourfold symmetry), and $\\theta_0$ is a phase offset corresponding to the crystal's orientation relative to the coordinate system.\n\nSince $R(\\theta)$ is independent of time $t$, we can integrate the evolution equation with respect to time from $t=0$ to a final time $t=T$. Given an initial circular profile of radius $r_0$ at $t=0$, the radius function at time $T$ becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{r(\\theta,0)}^{r(\\theta,T)} dr = \\int_0^T R(\\theta) dt\n$$\n$$\nr(\\theta, T) - r_0 = R(\\theta) \\cdot [t]_0^T\n$$\n$$\nr(\\theta, T) = r_0 + R(\\theta) \\cdot T\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $R(\\theta)$, we obtain the explicit analytical form for the evolved boundary:\n$$\nr(\\theta, T) = r_0 + T R_0 \\left[1 + \\varepsilon \\cos\\!\\big(k(\\theta - \\theta_0)\\big)\\right]\n$$\nThis equation provides the polar radius $r$ for any angle $\\theta$ at the specified evolution time $T$.\n\n**2. Numerical Algorithm**\n\nTo compute the required metrics, we discretize the continuous model.\n\n**2.1. Discretization**\nThe continuous angular domain $[0, 2\\pi)$ is sampled at $N=4096$ discrete, uniformly spaced points. The angle for the $i$-th sample is:\n$$\n\\theta_i = i \\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{N} \\quad \\text{for } i = 0, 1, \\dots, N-1\n$$\nFor each $\\theta_i$, we compute the corresponding radius $r_i = r(\\theta_i, T)$ using the analytical expression derived above. This yields a discrete vector of $N$ radii representing the etched shape.\n\n**2.2. Area Calculation**\nThe area $A$ of the shape enclosed by the polar curve $r(\\theta)$ is given by the integral:\n$$\nA = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^{2\\pi} r(\\theta)^2\\,d\\theta\n$$\nWe approximate this integral numerically using a Riemann sum over our discrete samples. The infinitesimal element $d\\theta$ is replaced by the discrete angular step $\\Delta\\theta = \\frac{2\\pi}{N}$.\n$$\nA \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} r_i^2 \\Delta\\theta = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} r_i^2 \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{N}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{N} \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} r_i^2\n$$\nWith $N=4096$, this numerical integration is highly accurate. All radii are in units of micrometers ($\\mu\\mathrm{m}$), so the resulting area $A$ is in square micrometers ($\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2$).\n\n**2.3. Symmetry Analysis**\nThe emergence of specific symmetries is quantified by computing the normalized discrete Fourier amplitudes $a_p$ for $p=4$ and $p=6$. The formula provided is:\n$$\na_p = \\frac{\\left|\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} r_i\\,e^{-\\,\\mathrm{i}\\,p\\,\\theta_i}\\right|}{\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} r_i}\n$$\nThe summation in the numerator, $\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} r_i\\,e^{-\\,\\mathrm{i}\\,p\\,\\theta_i}$, corresponds to the $p$-th component of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the radius vector $\\{r_i\\}$, since $\\theta_i = i \\frac{2\\pi}{N}$ results in the DFT kernel $e^{-\\mathrm{i}\\,2\\pi(pi)/N}$. This can be computed efficiently. The denominator is the sum of all radii, which is proportional to the DC component ($p=0$) of the Fourier series. Thus, $a_p$ represents the strength of the $p$-fold symmetric component relative to the average radius.\n\n**2.4. Symmetry Prediction**\nThe predicted dominant symmetry, $k_{\\text{pred}}$, is determined using a threshold $\\tau = 0.02$. The decision rule is as follows:\n- If $a_4  \\tau$ and $a_6  \\tau$, the profile is considered to lack significant fourfold or sixfold symmetry, so we set $k_{\\text{pred}} = 0$.\n- Otherwise, the dominant symmetry is that which corresponds to the larger amplitude. We set $k_{\\text{pred}} = \\arg\\max_{p \\in \\{4,6\\}} a_p$. In case of a numerical tie, we can default to $4$.\n\nThis complete algorithm is implemented for each of the five provided test cases to generate the final results.",
