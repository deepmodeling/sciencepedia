This practice  explores the fundamental kinetics governing this process, where the final surface coverage, $\\theta$, results from a competition between the deposition of polymer-forming radicals and their simultaneous removal by ion bombardment.

            "problem": "In plasma etching of a dielectric with fluorocarbon chemistry, sidewall passivation arises from polymer-forming neutral radicals depositing on the surface while simultaneous ion bombardment removes the passivation. Let the passivation coverage be a dimensionless fraction denoted by $\\theta \\in [0,1]$. Assume spatially uniform fluxes and a well-mixed surface such that the temporal evolution of $\\theta$ is governed by a single-site adsorption and first-order removal balance: the adsorption term scales with the inhibitor neutral flux $\\Gamma_{p}$ and the available fraction of unoccupied surface $(1-\\theta)$, with sticking probability $S \\in (0,1)$, and the removal term scales with the covered fraction $\\theta$ weighted by an effective removal rate $R_{s}(\\Gamma_{i},E)$ that depends on the ion flux $\\Gamma_{i}$ and ion energy $E$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is first subjected to a rigorous validation process.\n\n**Step 1: Extracted Givens**\n-   The system is plasma etching of a dielectric with fluorocarbon chemistry.\n-   The variable of interest is the sidewall passivation coverage, a dimensionless fraction denoted by $\\theta \\in [0,1]$.\n-   The temporal evolution of $\\theta$ is modeled by the differential equation:\n    $$ \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} \\;=\\; S\\,\\Gamma_{p}\\,(1-\\theta)\\;-\\;R_{s}(\\Gamma_{i},E)\\,\\theta $$\n-   $S$ is the sticking probability, with $S \\in (0,1)$.\n-   $\\Gamma_{p}$ is the inhibitor neutral flux.\n-   $R_{s}(\\Gamma_{i},E)$ is the effective removal rate, which is a function of the ion flux $\\Gamma_i$ and ion energy $E$.\n-   It is given that $R_{s}(\\Gamma_{i},E) > 0$.\n-   The monotonic properties of the removal rate function are specified as $\\frac{\\partial R_{s}}{\\partial E} > 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial R_{s}}{\\partial \\Gamma_{i}} > 0$.\n-   The task is to derive the steady-state coverage $\\theta^{*}$ and then justify its dependence on $\\Gamma_{p}$ and $E$.\n\n**Step 2: Validation Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. The provided differential equation is a form of the Langmuir adsorption model, a fundamental concept in surface science used to describe the kinetics of adsorption and desorption on a surface. This model is widely applied in chemical vapor deposition, etching, and catalysis. The physical meaning of each term is clear: $S\\Gamma_p(1-\\theta)$ represents the rate of adsorption onto available sites, and $R_s \\theta$ represents the rate of removal from occupied sites. The assumptions, such as $R_s > 0$ and the positive dependence of $R_s$ on ion energy and flux, are physically sound, corresponding to the principle that increased ion bombardment enhances the sputtering of the passivating polymer. The problem is well-posed, providing a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for $\\theta$ whose steady-state solution is uniquely determined. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is developed in two parts as required: first, the derivation of the steady-state coverage $\\theta^{*}$, and second, the analysis of its dependencies.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Steady-State Coverage $\\theta^{*}$**\nWe begin with the given mass balance equation for the surface coverage $\\theta$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = S\\,\\Gamma_{p}\\,(1-\\theta) - R_{s}(\\Gamma_{i},E)\\,\\theta $$\nSteady-state is achieved when the coverage no longer changes with time, which corresponds to the condition $\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = 0$. Let $\\theta^{*}$ denote the steady-state coverage. Substituting this condition into the balance equation yields:\n$$ 0 = S\\,\\Gamma_{p}\\,(1-\\theta^{*}) - R_{s}(\\Gamma_{i},E)\\,\\theta^{*} $$\nThis is an algebraic equation for $\\theta^{*}$. To solve for $\\theta^{*}$, we first distribute the term on the right-hand side:\n$$ S\\,\\Gamma_{p} - S\\,\\Gamma_{p}\\,\\theta^{*} - R_{s}(\\Gamma_{i},E)\\,\\theta^{*} = 0 $$\nNext, we gather all terms containing $\\theta^{*}$ on one side of the equation:\n$$ S\\,\\Gamma_{p} = S\\,\\Gamma_{p}\\,\\theta^{*} + R_{s}(\\Gamma_{i},E)\\,\\theta^{*} $$\nFactoring out $\\theta^{*}$ from the terms on the right-hand side, we get:\n$$ S\\,\\Gamma_{p} = \\left( S\\,\\Gamma_{p} + R_{s}(\\Gamma_{i},E) \\right) \\theta^{*} $$\nFinally, isolating $\\theta^{*}$ by dividing by the coefficient gives the expression for the steady-state coverage:\n$$ \\theta^{*} = \\frac{S\\,\\Gamma_{p}}{S\\,\\Gamma_{p} + R_{s}(\\Gamma_{i},E)} $$\nThis expression is physically consistent. Since $S \\in (0,1)$, $\\Gamma_{p} \\ge 0$, and $R_{s}(\\Gamma_{i},E) > 0$, the numerator is non-negative and the denominator is strictly positive. Thus, $\\theta^{*} \\ge 0$. Furthermore, because $R_{s}(\\Gamma_{i},E) > 0$, the denominator is strictly greater than the numerator (for $\\Gamma_p > 0$), which ensures that $\\theta^{*} < 1$. Therefore, the solution lies within the physically meaningful range $[0, 1)$.\n\n**Part 2: Analysis of Dependencies**\nWe now analyze how $\\theta^{*}$ changes with the inhibitor flux $\\Gamma_{p}$ and the ion energy $E$ by calculating the respective partial derivatives.\n\n1.  **Dependence on Inhibitor Flux $\\Gamma_{p}$**:\n    We compute the partial derivative of $\\theta^{*}$ with respect to $\\Gamma_{p}$ using the quotient rule for differentiation, $\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{u}{v}\\right) = \\frac{v \\frac{du}{dx} - u \\frac{dv}{dx}}{v^2}$. Let $u = S\\Gamma_{p}$ and $v = S\\Gamma_{p} + R_{s}(\\Gamma_{i},E)$.\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\Gamma_{p}} = S $$\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial \\Gamma_{p}} = S $$\n    Applying the quotient rule:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial \\theta^{*}}{\\partial \\Gamma_{p}} = \\frac{(S\\Gamma_{p} + R_{s}(\\Gamma_{i},E))(S) - (S\\Gamma_{p})(S)}{(S\\Gamma_{p} + R_{s}(\\Gamma_{i},E))^{2}} $$\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial \\theta^{*}}{\\partial \\Gamma_{p}} = \\frac{S^2\\Gamma_{p} + S R_{s}(\\Gamma_{i},E) - S^2\\Gamma_{p}}{(S\\Gamma_{p} + R_{s}(\\Gamma_{i},E))^{2}} $$\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial \\theta^{*}}{\\partial \\Gamma_{p}} = \\frac{S\\,R_{s}(\\Gamma_{i},E)}{(S\\Gamma_{p} + R_{s}(\\Gamma_{i},E))^{2}} $$\n    Given that $S > 0$ and $R_{s}(\\Gamma_{i},E) > 0$, the numerator $S\\,R_{s}(\\Gamma_{i},E)$ is strictly positive. The denominator is a squared term and therefore is non-negative; since $R_{s}(\\Gamma_{i},E) > 0$, it is strictly positive. Thus, the entire expression is positive:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial \\theta^{*}}{\\partial \\Gamma_{p}} > 0 $$\n    This result indicates that the steady-state coverage $\\theta^{*}$ is a monotonically increasing function of the inhibitor flux $\\Gamma_{p}$. This is physically intuitive: an increase in the flux of polymer-forming species leads to a higher rate of deposition and consequently a greater surface coverage.\n\n2.  **Dependence on Ion Energy $E$**:\n    We compute the partial derivative of $\\theta^{*}$ with respect to $E$. Note that $S$ and $\\Gamma_{p}$ are independent of $E$. The dependence enters through the removal rate $R_{s}(\\Gamma_{i},E)$. We can write $\\theta^{*}$ as:\n    $$ \\theta^{*} = S\\Gamma_{p} \\left( S\\Gamma_{p} + R_{s}(\\Gamma_{i},E) \\right)^{-1} $$\n    Using the chain rule:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial \\theta^{*}}{\\partial E} = S\\Gamma_{p} \\cdot (-1) \\left( S\\Gamma_{p} + R_{s}(\\Gamma_{i},E) \\right)^{-2} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial E}\\left(S\\Gamma_{p} + R_{s}(\\Gamma_{i},E)\\right) $$\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial \\theta^{*}}{\\partial E} = - \\frac{S\\Gamma_{p}}{\\left( S\\Gamma_{p} + R_{s}(\\Gamma_{i},E) \\right)^{2}} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial R_{s}}{\\partial E} $$\n    We analyze the sign of this derivative. The term $\\frac{S\\Gamma_{p}}{\\left( S\\Gamma_{p} + R_{s}(\\Gamma_{i},E) \\right)^{2}}$ is non-negative (it is positive for any non-zero flux $\\Gamma_p$). The problem statement specifies that the removal rate increases with ion energy, i.e., $\\frac{\\partial R_{s}}{\\partial E} > 0$. Therefore, the derivative is a product of a negative sign, a positive term, and another positive term:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial \\theta^{*}}{\\partial E} < 0 $$\n    This result shows that the steady-state coverage $\\theta^{*}$ is a monotonically decreasing function of the ion energy $E$. This is also physically sound: higher ion energy increases the efficacy of the sputtering process, leading to a higher removal rate of the passivating polymer and thus a lower surface coverage.",

The key is to recognize that the straight segment must align with the net displacement vector formed by the contributions along the perimeter.

The model must link coverage-dependent etch rates to a quantitative taper metric derived from the ratio of lateral to vertical etch velocities. The computational objective is to produce the taper angle in radians for a set of test cases.\n\nStarting from first principles in surface kinetics and flux-based removal, define the steady-state coverage on the bottom and sidewall surfaces using Langmuir-type site occupancy and removal balance. Let $J_i$ be the ion flux to the bottom in $\\text{m}^{-2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, $F_n$ be the neutral etchant flux in $\\text{m}^{-2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, and $F_c$ be the fluorocarbon passivator flux in $\\text{m}^{-2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.

            "solution": "The problem posed is a valid and well-defined exercise in the modeling of plasma-surface interactions, specifically concerning feature profile evolution in fluorocarbon-based plasma etching. The model is based on established first principles of surface science, including Langmuir-type adsorption kinetics, flux balance at steady state, and coverage-dependent reaction rates. All parameters, equations, and boundary conditions are explicitly provided, and the physical quantities and their units are dimensionally consistent. The problem is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and algorithmically solvable. We shall therefore proceed with a systematic derivation of the solution.\n\nThe computational objective is to determine the etch profile taper angle, $\\varphi$, which is a geometric consequence of the competition between vertical etching of the feature bottom ($R_b$) and lateral etching of its sidewalls ($R_{sw}$). The algorithm follows a direct path of calculation dictated by the physical model.\n\nFirst, we establish the incident particle fluxes on both the bottom and sidewall surfaces. The ion flux, $J_i$, is assumed to be highly directional and primarily bombards the bottom surface. A small fraction, $\\eta_i$, strikes the sidewall due to scattering or thermal motion, yielding a sidewall ion flux of $J_{i,sw} = \\eta_i J_i$. Neutral species (etchant $F_n$ and passivant $F_c$) are assumed to have a more isotropic velocity distribution, but their transport into high-aspect-ratio features can be limited by geometry (shadowing). This is modeled by a transport factor $\\chi$ for the neutral etchant, such that the sidewall flux is $F_{n,sw} = \\chi F_n$. The passivant flux $F_c$ is assumed to be uniform, contributing equally to both surfaces. This assumption simplifies the model by positing that the source of $F_c$ is sufficiently diffuse or polymerizing reactions are not severely limited by line-of-sight transport.\n\nSecond, we determine the steady-state surface coverage of the passivating fluorocarbon layer on both surfaces, $\\theta_b$ and $\\theta_{sw}$. The model employs a Langmuir-type site balance. The rate of site occupation is proportional to the passivant flux $F_c$, its sticking coefficient $s_c$, the site area $a_s$, and the fraction of available empty sites $(1 - \\theta)$. The rate of site clearing is the sum of thermal desorption, with rate constants $k_{des}$, and ion-induced removal, proportional to the local ion flux and a removal coefficient $\\gamma$. At steady state, the rate of change of coverage is zero, leading to the provided expressions:\n$$\n\\theta_b = \\frac{s_c F_c a_s}{s_c F_c a_s + k_{des,b} + \\gamma_b J_i}\n$$\n$$\n\\theta_{sw} = \\frac{s_c F_c a_s}{s_c F_c a_s + k_{des,sw} + \\gamma_{sw} J_{i,sw}}\n$$\nThe numerator, $s_c F_c a_s$, represents the per-site adsorption rate. The denominator is the sum of this adsorption rate and the per-site removal rates from all mechanisms. The resulting $\\theta$ is a dimensionless fraction between $0$ and $1$.\n\nThird, we compute the etch rates. The model posits that etching occurs on sites not blocked by the passivant, so the rates are proportional to the fraction of uncovered surface, $(1 - \\theta)$. The base etch rate is a linear combination of ion-driven and neutral-driven chemical etching. The respective contributions are weighted by the etch-rate coefficients $K_{ib}, K_{nb}, K_{isw}, K_{nsw}$.\nThe vertical etch rate, $R_b$ (on the bottom), is:\n$$\nR_b = \\big(K_{ib} J_i + K_{nb} F_n\\big)\\,\\big(1 - \\theta_b\\big)\n$$\nThe lateral etch rate, $R_{sw}$ (on the sidewall), is:\n$$\nR_{sw} = \\big(K_{isw} J_{i,sw} + K_{nsw} F_{n,sw}\\big)\\,\\big(1 - \\theta_{sw}\\big)\n$$\nAnisotropy control is achieved when $R_b$ is maximized while $R_{sw}$ is minimized. This typically occurs when $\\theta_{sw}$ approaches unity (full sidewall protection) while $\\theta_b$ is kept low by high ion bombardment.\n\nFinally, the taper angle $\\varphi$ is defined as the angle of the etched wall with respect to the vertical axis. It is determined by the ratio of the lateral and vertical etch velocities.\n$$\n\\varphi = \\arctan\\!\\left(\\frac{R_{sw}}{R_b}\\right)\n$$\nA value of $\\varphi=0$ corresponds to a perfectly vertical (anisotropic) profile, while a positive $\\varphi$ indicates a sloped or \"tapered\" profile.\n\nThe implementation will consist of a function that takes the fifteen input parameters for a given case and executes these four steps in sequence to produce $\\varphi$. This function will be called for each of the five test cases provided. The results, formatted to six decimal places, will be compiled into a single list for the final output.",
