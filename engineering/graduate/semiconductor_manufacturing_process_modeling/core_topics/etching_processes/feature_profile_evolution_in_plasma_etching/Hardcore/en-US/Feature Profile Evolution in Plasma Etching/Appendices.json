In this specific problem, assuming the fluxes are uniform and the surface is open to the entire hemisphere, $v_n$ is constant.\n\n**Justification of Angular Dependence**\nThe angular dependence enters the model through the integration of the product of two angle-dependent functions: the incident flux distribution $F_j(\\theta)$ and the material yield $Y_j(\\theta)$. The total etch rate is an overlap integral, $R_j = \\int Y_j(\\theta) F_j(\\theta) d\\Omega$.\n- $F_j(\\theta)$ describes the directionality of incident particles. For ions, $F_i(\\theta) \\propto \\cos^{\\beta}\\theta$ with a large $\\beta$ ($8$ in this case) models a highly directional flux, peaked at normal incidence ($\\theta=0$), which is characteristic of ions accelerated across a plasma sheath. For neutrals, $F_n(\\theta)$ is constant, modeling an isotropic, thermal flux.\n- $Y_j(\\theta)$ describes the efficiency of material removal as a function of impact angle. The ion-assisted yield, $Y_i(\\theta) \\propto \\cos^{\\mu}\\theta$, models a process (like physical sputtering) that is most efficient at normal incidence. The chemical neutral yield $Y_n(\\theta)$ is constant, modeling a process insensitive to impact angle.\nThe final derived expression for $v_n$ contains the factor $\\frac{\\beta+1}{\\beta+\\mu+1}$, which mathematically encapsulates how the angular shapes of the ion flux (via $\\beta$) and ion yield (via $\\mu$) combine to determine the effective, angle-averaged ion etch rate.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe are given the following parameter values:\n$\\Omega=2.00\\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{3}$\n$\\Gamma_{i0}=2.00\\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$\\Gamma_{n0}=5.00\\times 10^{17}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$Y_{i0}=1.50\\,\\mathrm{atoms\\,ion}^{-1}$\n$Y_{n0}=2.00\\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{atoms\\,neutral}^{-1}$\n$\\beta=8$\n$\\mu=1$\n\nFirst, calculate the individual etch rates in atoms$\\cdot$cm$^{-2}\\cdot$s$^{-1}$:\n$$R_n = Y_{n0}\\Gamma_{n0} = (2.00\\times 10^{-2}) \\cdot (5.00\\times 10^{17}) = 1.00 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{atoms\\,cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n$$R_i = Y_{i0}\\Gamma_{i0}\\frac{\\beta+1}{\\beta+\\mu+1} = (1.50) \\cdot (2.00\\times 10^{16}) \\cdot \\frac{8+1}{8+1+1} = (3.00\\times 10^{16}) \\cdot \\frac{9}{10}$$\n$$R_i = 2.70 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{atoms\\,cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n\nThe total etch rate is:\n$$R_{total} = R_i + R_n = 2.70 \\times 10^{16} + 1.00 \\times 10^{16} = 3.70 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{atoms\\,cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n\nNow, calculate the normal velocity $v_n$ in cm/s:\n$$v_n = \\Omega \\cdot R_{total} = (2.00 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^3) \\cdot (3.70 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})$$\n$$v_n = 7.40 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{cm/s}$$\n\nFinally, convert the velocity to nanometers per second (nm/s).

            "solution": "The solution is developed in two parts as required: first, the derivation of the steady-state coverage $\\theta^{*}$, and second, the analysis of its dependencies.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Steady-State Coverage $\\theta^{*}$**\nWe begin with the given mass balance equation for the surface coverage $\\theta$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = S\\,\\Gamma_{p}\\,(1-\\theta) - R_{s}(\\Gamma_{i},E)\\,\\theta $$\nSteady-state is achieved when the coverage no longer changes with time, which corresponds to the condition $\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = 0$.

Since $S \\in (0,1)$, $\\Gamma_{p} \\ge 0$, and $R_{s}(\\Gamma_{i},E)  0$, the numerator is non-negative and the denominator is strictly positive. Thus, $\\theta^{*} \\ge 0$.

The denominator is a squared term and therefore is non-negative; since $R_{s}(\\Gamma_{i},E)  0$, it is strictly positive. Thus, the entire expression is positive:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial \\theta^{*}}{\\partial \\Gamma_{p}}  0 $$\n    This result indicates that the steady-state coverage $\\theta^{*}$ is a monotonically increasing function of the inhibitor flux $\\Gamma_{p}$. This is physically intuitive: an increase in the flux of polymer-forming species leads to a higher rate of deposition and consequently a greater surface coverage.\n\n2.  **Dependence on Ion Energy $E$**:\n    We compute the partial derivative of $\\theta^{*}$ with respect to $E$. Note that $S$ and $\\Gamma_{p}$ are independent of $E$. The dependence enters through the removal rate $R_{s}(\\Gamma_{i},E)$. We can write $\\theta^{*}$ as:\n    $$ \\theta^{*} = S\\Gamma_{p} \\left( S\\Gamma_{p} + R_{s}(\\Gamma_{i},E) \\right)^{-1} $$\n    Using the chain rule:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial \\theta^{*}}{\\partial E} = S\\Gamma_{p} \\cdot (-1) \\left( S\\Gamma_{p} + R_{s}(\\Gamma_{i},E) \\right)^{-2} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial E}\\left(S\\Gamma_{p} + R_{s}(\\Gamma_{i},E)\\right) $$\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial \\theta^{*}}{\\partial E} = - \\frac{S\\Gamma_{p}}{\\left( S\\Gamma_{p} + R_{s}(\\Gamma_{i},E) \\right)^{2}} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial R_{s}}{\\partial E} $$\n    We analyze the sign of this derivative. The term $\\frac{S\\Gamma_{p}}{\\left( S\\Gamma_{p} + R_{s}(\\Gamma_{i},E) \\right)^{2}}$ is non-negative (it is positive for any non-zero flux $\\Gamma_p$). The problem statement specifies that the removal rate increases with ion energy, i.e., $\\frac{\\partial R_{s}}{\\partial E}  0$. Therefore, the derivative is a product of a negative sign, a positive term, and another positive term:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial \\theta^{*}}{\\partial E}  0 $$\n    This result shows that the steady-state coverage $\\theta^{*}$ is a monotonically decreasing function of the ion energy $E$.
