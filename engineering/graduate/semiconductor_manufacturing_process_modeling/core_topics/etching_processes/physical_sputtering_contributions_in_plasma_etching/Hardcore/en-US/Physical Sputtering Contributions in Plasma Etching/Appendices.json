All necessary data and constants are provided, and the task is a standard application of classical mechanics and concepts from the physics of plasma-surface interactions.\n\nFirst, the quantitative part of the problem asks for the momentum $p$ of three different ion species ($\\text{Ne}^{+}$, $\\text{Ar}^{+}$, and $\\text{Xe}^{+}$), each with a kinetic energy of $E_{i} = 200\\ \\text{eV}$.

Sputter yield is defined as the average number of target atoms ejected per incident ion.\n\nAccording to Sigmund’s linear collision cascade theory, the sputter yield $Y$ for an ion of energy $E_i$ is proportional to the energy deposited by the ion in the near-surface region of the target through nuclear collisions. This deposited energy is quantified by the nuclear stopping power, $S_n(E_i)$.\n$$Y(E_i) \\propto F_D(E_i, 0)$$\nwhere $F_D(E_i, 0)$ is the energy density deposited at the surface. In the linear cascade regime, this further simplifies to $Y \\propto \\alpha S_n(E_i)$, where $\\alpha$ is a material-dependent constant related to the target's surface binding energy and the mass ratio of target to projectile atoms. At the energy specified, $E_i=200\\ \\text{eV}$, nuclear stopping is the dominant energy loss mechanism for heavy ions, justifying this approach.\n\nThe computed momenta show the ordering $p_{\\text{Ne}} < p_{\\text{Ar}} < p_{\\text{Xe}}$. Since energy $E_i$ is fixed, this ordering is a direct consequence of the increasing mass, as $p = \\sqrt{2m_i E_i}$ implies $p \\propto \\sqrt{m_i}$.\n\nThe efficiency of energy transfer in a single binary collision between an incident ion of mass $m_i$ and a stationary target atom of mass $m_t$ is maximized when the masses are matched ($m_i = m_t$). For a $\\text{SiO}_2$ target, the masses are $m_{\\text{Si}} \\approx 28\\ \\text{u}$ and $m_{\\text{O}} \\approx 16\\ \\text{u}$. The average target atom mass can be approximated as $m_{\\text{avg}} = (m_{\\text{Si}} + 2m_{\\text{O}})/3 \\approx 20\\ \\text{u}$.\nComparing ion masses ($m_{\\text{Ne}} \\approx 20\\ \\text{u}$, $m_{\\text{Ar}} \\approx 40\\ \\text{u}$, $m_{\\text{Xe}} \\approx 131\\ \\text{u}$) with $m_{\\text{avg}} \\approx 20\\ \\text{u}$, it is evident that $\\text{Ne}^{+}$ offers the best mass-matching.\n\nHowever, the total sputter yield depends on the entire collision cascade, not just the first collision. A heavier ion, carrying significantly more momentum for a fixed energy, can more effectively displace target atoms and initiate a denser, more energetic cascade. While the energy transfer efficiency per collision may be lower for a heavy projectile on a light target (e.g., $\\text{Xe}$ on $\\text{SiO}_2$), the total energy deposited via nuclear stopping, $S_n$, generally increases with the projectile mass $m_i$ in this energy regime. The larger momentum of heavier ions results in more forward-directed scattering of recoils, which drives a deeper and more voluminous cascade. A more extensive cascade has a higher probability of intersecting the surface and ejecting atoms.\n\nTherefore, despite poorer mass-matching, the greater momentum of the heavier ions ($\\text{Ar}^{+}$ and especially $\\text{Xe}^{+}$) leads to a more significant overall energy deposition into the collision cascade and, consequently, a higher sputter yield. The correlation is direct: an increase in ion mass at a fixed energy leads to an increase in both momentum and sputter yield. The expected ordering of sputter yields is thus $Y(\\text{Ne}^{+}) < Y(\\text{Ar}^{+}) < Y(\\text{Xe}^{+})$, which directly correlates with the computed momentum ordering $p_{\\text{Ne}} < p_{\\text{Ar}} < p_{\\text{Xe}}$.",
