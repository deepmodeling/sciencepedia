            "introduction": "To effectively control a wet etching process, it is essential to understand the interplay between the transport of reactants to the surface and the intrinsic rate of the surface reaction. This exercise guides you through the derivation of a foundational one-dimensional reaction-diffusion model, revealing how the overall etch rate is governed by a combination of diffusive transport resistance and kinetic reaction resistance. By deriving the apparent rate coefficient from first principles, both with and without a site-blocking surfactant, you will gain a quantitative understanding of how these additives control etch rates by modifying the kinetic component in this coupled system.

            "problem": "A quiescent liquid boundary layer of thickness $L$ separates a bulk solution at $x=L$ from a perfectly planar crystalline surface at $x=0$ undergoing wet etching. The etching species has diffusivity $D$ in the liquid. The bulk concentration at $x=L$ is maintained at a constant value $c_{b}$ by forced convection outside the boundary layer. Within the quiescent layer there is no convection, only molecular diffusion. At steady state, the normal molar flux $J$ toward the surface is governed by Fick’s first law, and the concentration field $c(x)$ satisfies steady mass conservation. The intrinsic surface reaction is first order in the surface-adjacent concentration $c_{s} \\equiv c(0)$, with boundary condition $J = k\\,c_{s}$ in the surfactant-free case, where $k$ is the intrinsic first-order surface rate coefficient. When a surfactant is present that blocks a uniform fraction $\\theta$ of surface sites (assume $\\theta$ is spatially uniform and constant in time over the time scale of interest), only the unblocked fraction of sites react. Model this by replacing the intrinsic boundary condition with $J = k\\,(1-\\theta)\\,c_{s}$, and assume that the blocking does not alter $D$ or $L$.\n\nStarting from Fick’s first law and the stated boundary conditions, and invoking only steady-state diffusion in one dimension with appropriate boundary conditions at $x=0$ and $x=L$, perform the following:\n\n- Derive the steady-state concentration profile $c(x)$ within the quiescent layer and the net flux $J$ to the surface in the surfactant-free case.\n- Repeat the derivation with site-blocking by surfactant (fractional coverage $\\theta$) treated as above.\n- Define the overall apparent first-order rate coefficient $k_{\\mathrm{app}}(\\theta)$ by $J = k_{\\mathrm{app}}(\\theta)\\,c_{b}$, and express $k_{\\mathrm{app}}(\\theta)$ in closed form in terms of $k$, $D$, $L$, and $\\theta$. Clearly show how the dependence on $k$ and $D$ arises from the coupled transport–reaction problem.\n\nFor purposes of scoring, report only the final compact analytic expression for $k_{\\mathrm{app}}(\\theta)$. Express $k_{\\mathrm{app}}(\\theta)$ in the same units as $k$ (length per time). No numerical evaluation is required.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It outlines a standard one-dimensional, steady-state reaction-diffusion problem, a cornerstone of transport phenomena and chemical reaction engineering. All necessary parameters and boundary conditions are provided to derive a unique solution. The model, involving Fickian diffusion coupled with a first-order surface reaction modified by site-blocking, is a well-established and physically realistic simplification used in modeling heterogeneous catalysis and etching processes. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution is warranted.\n\nThe fundamental governing equation for the concentration $c(x)$ of the etching species within the quiescent boundary layer is derived from steady-state mass conservation. In one dimension, this dictates that the flux $J_x$ is constant with respect to position $x$. Fick's first law relates the flux to the concentration gradient: $J_x = -D \\frac{dc}{dx}$, where $D$ is the diffusivity. Since $D$ is constant, we have $\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( -D \\frac{dc}{dx} \\right) = 0$, which simplifies to the one-dimensional steady-state diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2c}{dx^2} = 0\n$$\nThe general solution to this second-order ordinary differential equation is a linear concentration profile:\n$$\nc(x) = M x + N\n$$\nwhere $M$ and $N$ are integration constants to be determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nThe first boundary condition is at the edge of the quiescent layer, $x=L$, where the concentration is maintained at the bulk value $c_b$:\n$$\nc(L) = c_b\n$$\nThe second boundary condition is at the reacting surface, $x=0$. At steady state, the flux of reactant arriving at the surface via diffusion must equal the rate of consumption by the surface reaction. The molar flux $J$ is defined as the positive quantity of moles per unit area per unit time moving towards the surface. The flux vector points in the negative $x$ direction, so its magnitude $J$ is related to the gradient by $J = -J_x = D \\frac{dc}{dx}$. The reaction rate is given as a function of the local surface concentration $c_s \\equiv c(0)$.\n\nFirst, we will solve the problem for the surfactant-free case.\n\n**Surfactant-Free Case**\n\nIn the absence of surfactant, the surface reaction rate is given by $k c_s$, where $k$ is the intrinsic first-order rate coefficient. The boundary condition at $x=0$ is:\n$$\nJ = D \\left. \\frac{dc}{dx} \\right|_{x=0} = k \\, c(0)\n$$\nWe apply these two boundary conditions to the general solution $c(x) = M x + N$.\nFrom the general solution, we have $\\frac{dc}{dx} = M$ and $c(0) = N$.\nApplying the boundary condition at $x=L$:\n$$\nc(L) = M L + N = c_b\n$$\nApplying the boundary condition at $x=0$:\n$$\nD M = k N\n$$\nWe now have a system of two linear equations for $M$ and $N$. From the second equation, we express $M$ in terms of $N$: $M = \\frac{k}{D} N$. Substituting this into the first equation:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{k}{D} N \\right) L + N = c_b\n$$\nSolving for $N$:\n$$\nN \\left( \\frac{k L}{D} + 1 \\right) = c_b \\implies N = \\frac{c_b}{1 + \\frac{kL}{D}}\n$$\nThis gives the surface concentration $c_s = c(0) = N$. Now we find $M$:\n$$\nM = \\frac{k}{D} N = \\frac{k}{D} \\frac{c_b}{1 + \\frac{kL}{D}}\n$$\nThe steady-state concentration profile $c(x)$ is therefore:\n$$\nc(x) = \\left( \\frac{k}{D} \\frac{c_b}{1 + \\frac{kL}{D}} \\right) x + \\frac{c_b}{1 + \\frac{kL}{D}} = c_b \\frac{1 + \\frac{kx}{D}}{1 + \\frac{kL}{D}}\n$$\nThe net flux to the surface, $J$, can be calculated from $J = k c_s = k N$:\n$$\nJ = k \\left( \\frac{c_b}{1 + \\frac{kL}{D}} \\right) = \\frac{k c_b}{1 + \\frac{kL}{D}}\n$$\n\n**Surfactant Case**\n\nWhen surfactant is present, covering a fraction $\\theta$ of the surface sites, the intrinsic rate coefficient $k$ is replaced by an effective rate coefficient $k_{\\mathrm{eff}} = k(1-\\theta)$. The physics of the diffusion and the structure of the equations remain unchanged. We can obtain the solution for this case by substituting $k(1-\\theta)$ for $k$ in the results derived above.\nThe boundary condition at $x=0$ becomes:\n$$\nJ = D \\left. \\frac{dc}{dx} \\right|_{x=0} = k(1-\\theta) \\, c(0)\n$$\nFollowing the same procedure, the constants $M$ and $N$ are found by solving:\n$$\nM L + N = c_b\n$$\n$$\nD M = k(1-\\theta)N\n$$\nThis yields:\n$$\nN = c(0) = \\frac{c_b}{1 + \\frac{k(1-\\theta)L}{D}}\n$$\nThe concentration profile $c(x)$ in the presence of surfactant is:\n$$\nc(x) = c_b \\frac{1 + \\frac{k(1-\\theta)x}{D}}{1 + \\frac{k(1-\\theta)L}{D}}\n$$\nAnd the net flux to the surface, $J$, is:\n$$\nJ = k(1-\\theta)c(0) = k(1-\\theta) \\left( \\frac{c_b}{1 + \\frac{k(1-\\theta)L}{D}} \\right) = \\frac{k(1-\\theta)c_b}{1 + \\frac{k(1-\\theta)L}{D}}\n$$\n\n**Derivation of the Apparent Rate Coefficient $k_{\\mathrm{app}}(\\theta)$**\n\nThe problem defines the overall apparent first-order rate coefficient, $k_{\\mathrm{app}}(\\theta)$, through the relation $J = k_{\\mathrm{app}}(\\theta) c_b$. We can find the expression for $k_{\\mathrm{app}}(\\theta)$ by equating this definition with our derived expression for the flux $J$ in the surfactant case:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{app}}(\\theta) c_b = \\frac{k(1-\\theta) c_b}{1 + \\frac{k(1-\\theta)L}{D}}\n$$\nAssuming $c_b \\neq 0$, we can divide both sides by $c_b$ to isolate $k_{\\mathrm{app}}(\\theta)$:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{app}}(\\theta) = \\frac{k(1-\\theta)}{1 + \\frac{k(1-\\theta)L}{D}}\n$$\nTo reveal the underlying physics of coupled transport and reaction, it is instructive to rewrite this expression by taking its reciprocal:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{app}}(\\theta)} = \\frac{1 + \\frac{k(1-\\theta)L}{D}}{k(1-\\theta)} = \\frac{1}{k(1-\\theta)} + \\frac{L}{D}\n$$\nThis form shows that the overall process exhibits a total \"resistance\" to mass transfer, $\\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{app}}(\\theta)}$, which is the sum of two resistances in series: a kinetic resistance from the surface reaction, $\\frac{1}{k(1-\\theta)}$, and a transport resistance from diffusion, $\\frac{L}{D}$. The dependence on both the intrinsic reaction rate coefficient $k$ and the diffusivity $D$ arises naturally from this coupling.\nInverting this expression gives the final compact form for $k_{\\mathrm{app}}(\\theta)$:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{app}}(\\theta) = \\left( \\frac{1}{k(1-\\theta)} + \\frac{L}{D} \\right)^{-1}\n$$\nThis is the requested expression.",
