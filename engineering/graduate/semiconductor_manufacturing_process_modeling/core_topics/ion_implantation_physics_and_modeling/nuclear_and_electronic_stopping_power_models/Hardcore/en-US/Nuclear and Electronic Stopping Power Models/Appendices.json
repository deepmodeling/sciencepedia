            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the microscopic electronic stopping cross section, $S_e(E)$, from the macroscopic electronic stopping power, $-\\frac{dE}{dx}$. This involves three sequential steps: first, computing the atomic number density $N$ of the target material (silicon); second, deriving the fundamental relationship between macroscopic stopping power and the microscopic stopping cross section; and third, using this relationship and the calculated density to find the value of $S_e(E)$.\n\n**Step 1: Computation of Atomic Number Density ($N$)**\n\nThe atomic number density, $N$, represents the number of atoms per unit volume. It can be derived from the mass density $\\rho$, the atomic mass $A$ (often called molar mass in this context), and Avogadro's number $N_A$.\n\nThe mass density $\\rho$ is given in units of mass per volume (e.g., $\\mathrm{g/cm^3}$).\nThe atomic mass $A$ is given in units of mass per mole (e.g., $\\mathrm{g/mol}$).\nDividing the mass density by the atomic mass yields the molar density, which is the number of moles per unit volume:\n$$ \\text{Molar Density} = \\frac{\\rho}{A} \\quad [\\mathrm{mol/cm^3}] $$\nAvogadro's number, $N_A$, gives the number of atoms per mole ($\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}$). To find the number of atoms per unit volume, we multiply the molar density by Avogadro's number:\n$$ N = \\frac{\\rho}{A} \\cdot N_A $$\nUsing the given values for silicon:\n- Mass density $\\rho = 2.33\\,\\mathrm{g/cm^3}$\n- Atomic mass $A = 28.0855\\,\\mathrm{g/mol}$\n- Avogadro's number $N_A = 6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}$\n\nWe can compute the numerical value for $N$:\n$$ N = \\frac{2.33\\,\\mathrm{g/cm^3}}{28.0855\\,\\mathrm{g/mol}} \\times (6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}) $$\n$$ N \\approx 4.9953 \\times 10^{22}\\,\\mathrm{atoms/cm^3} $$\nThis value will be used in the final calculation.\n\n**Step 2: Derivation of the Relationship between Stopping Power and Stopping Cross Section**\n\nThe macroscopic stopping power, which we denote as $S(E)$, is defined as the average energy loss of a projectile per unit path length in a material, $S(E) = -\\frac{dE}{dx}$.\n\nThe microscopic electronic stopping cross section, $S_e(E)$, is defined through its relationship with the energy loss $\\Delta E(b)$ in a single collision with impact parameter $b$:\n$$ S_e(E) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\Delta E(b) \\, 2\\pi b \\, db $$\nThis quantity has units of energy $\\times$ area.\n\nTo derive the relationship between $S(E)$ and $S_e(E)$, we consider a projectile traveling a small distance $\\Delta x$ through a uniform medium with atomic number density $N$. We can calculate the total energy lost, $-\\Delta E$, by summing the energy lost in all individual collisions within this segment of the path.\n\nThe number of target atoms located within a cylindrical shell of radius $b$ to $b+db$ and length $\\Delta x$ is given by the product of the number density $N$ and the volume of the shell, $dV = (2\\pi b \\, db) \\Delta x$.\n$$ d(\\text{Number of atoms}) = N \\cdot (2\\pi b \\, db \\, \\Delta x) $$\nThe energy lost to these atoms is the product of the number of atoms and the energy loss per collision at that impact parameter, $\\Delta E(b)$.\n$$ d(-\\Delta E) = \\Delta E(b) \\cdot [N \\cdot (2\\pi b \\, db \\, \\Delta x)] $$\nTo find the total energy loss $-\\Delta E$ in the path length $\\Delta x$, we integrate over all possible impact parameters from $b=0$ to $b=\\infty$:\n$$ -\\Delta E = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\Delta E(b) N (2\\pi b \\, db \\, \\Delta x) $$\nSince $N$ and $\\Delta x$ are constant with respect to the integration variable $b$, we can factor them out:\n$$ -\\Delta E = N \\Delta x \\left[ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\Delta E(b) 2\\pi b \\, db \\right] $$\nThe term in the brackets is, by definition, the microscopic stopping cross section $S_e(E)$:\n$$ -\\Delta E = N \\Delta x S_e(E) $$\nDividing by the path length $\\Delta x$ gives the energy loss per unit length:\n$$ -\\frac{\\Delta E}{\\Delta x} = N S_e(E) $$\nIn the limit as $\\Delta x \\to 0$, this becomes the definition of the macroscopic stopping power:\n$$ S(E) = -\\frac{dE}{dx} = N \\cdot S_e(E) $$\nThis is the fundamental relationship connecting the macroscopic, experimentally measurable quantity $-\\frac{dE}{dx}$ with the microscopic, theoretical quantity $S_e(E)$.\n\n**Step 3: Conversion of Stopping Power to Stopping Cross Section**\n\nFrom the derived relation, we can solve for the electronic stopping cross section:\n$$ S_e(E) = \\frac{1}{N} \\left(-\\frac{dE}{dx}\\right) $$\nWe are given the stopping power and need to express it in units compatible with the calculated density $N$. The final answer is required in units of $\\mathrm{eV\\cdot cm^2/atom}$.\n\nFirst, we convert the given stopping power:\n$$ -\\frac{dE}{dx} = 200\\,\\mathrm{keV/\\mu m} $$\nUsing the conversion factors $1\\,\\mathrm{keV} = 10^3\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and $1\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m} = 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{cm}$:\n$$ -\\frac{dE}{dx} = 200 \\times \\frac{10^3\\,\\mathrm{eV}}{10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{cm}} = 200 \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{eV/cm} = 2 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{eV/cm} $$\nNow, we can substitute the values for the stopping power and the atomic number density into the equation for $S_e(E)$:\n$$ S_e(E) = \\frac{2 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{eV/cm}}{4.9953 \\times 10^{22}\\,\\mathrm{atoms/cm^3}} $$\nThe units simplify as expected:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{eV/cm}}{\\mathrm{atoms/cm^3}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{eV}}{\\mathrm{cm}} \\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{cm^3}}{\\mathrm{atom}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{eV \\cdot cm^2}}{\\mathrm{atom}} $$\nPerforming the numerical calculation:\n$$ S_e(E) = \\frac{2}{4.9953} \\times 10^{(9-22)}\\,\\mathrm{eV \\cdot cm^2/atom} $$\n$$ S_e(E) \\approx 0.400376 \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{eV \\cdot cm^2/atom} $$\n$$ S_e(E) \\approx 4.00376 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{eV \\cdot cm^2/atom} $$\nThe problem asks to round the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$ S_e(E) \\approx 4.004 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{eV \\cdot cm^2/atom} $$",

Under the Ziegler–Biersack–Littmark (ZBL) universal screening potential, the interatomic potential between an ion of atomic number $Z_1$ and mass $M_1$ and a target atom of atomic number $Z_2$ and mass $M_2$ can be written as $V(r) = \\frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 r} \\,\\phi(r/a_U)$, where $\\phi(\\cdot)$ is a dimensionless screening function and $a_U$ is the universal screening length that scales as $a_U = \\frac{0.8854\\,a_0}{Z_1^{0.23} + Z_2^{0.23}}$, with $a_0$ the Bohr radius. The strength of elastic scattering and the nuclear stopping response are governed by the screened potential and two-body collision kinematics, which can be parameterized by a reduced energy that is inversely proportional to $Z_1 Z_2$ and depends on the center-of-mass energy $E_{\\mathrm{cm}}$ of the ion–atom system.

A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\n\nThe nuclear stopping power, $S_n$, is fundamentally determined by the energy transfer in elastic collisions between the incident ion and target atoms. In the framework of Lindhard, Scharff, and Schiøtt (LSS) theory, which underpins the ZBL model, the behavior is best understood using universal, dimensionless variables.\n\nThe key parameter is the reduced energy, $\\epsilon$, defined as:\n$$ \\epsilon = \\frac{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 a_U}{Z_1 Z_2 e^2} E_{\\mathrm{cm}} = \\frac{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 a_U M_2}{Z_1 Z_2 e^2 (M_1 + M_2)} E $$\nThe nuclear stopping power $S_n$ can be expressed in terms of a universal reduced stopping cross-section, $s_n(\\epsilon)$, as:\n$$ S_n = N_v \\left( \\frac{\\pi a_U^2 \\gamma E}{\\epsilon} \\right) s_n(\\epsilon) $$\nwhere $N_v$ is the volume density of target atoms and $\\gamma = \\frac{4 M_1 M_2}{(M_1 + M_2)^2}$ is the kinematic energy transfer factor. A more transparent form for scaling is:\n$$ S_n \\propto Z_1 Z_2 a_U \\frac{M_1}{M_1+M_2} s_n(\\epsilon) $$\nThe function $s_n(\\epsilon)$ is a universal curve that peaks around $\\epsilon \\approx 0.3 - 0.5$ and decreases for larger $\\epsilon$. For low energies ($\\epsilon \\ll 1$), $s_n(\\epsilon)$ increases with $\\epsilon$. We must calculate the reduced energy $\\epsilon$ for both B and As ions to determine where they are on this curve.\n\nLet us calculate the relevant parameters for each system. We can work with proportionalities since we only need a comparison.\n\n**System 1: $20\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ B in Si**\n- $Z_1 = 5$, $M_1 = 11\\,\\mathrm{amu}$\n- $Z_2 = 14$, $M_2 = 28\\,\\mathrm{amu}$\n- Center-of-mass energy: $E_{\\mathrm{cm}}(\\text{B}) = (20\\,\\mathrm{keV}) \\frac{28}{11 + 28} = (20\\,\\mathrm{keV})\\frac{28}{39} \\approx 14.36\\,\\mathrm{keV}$.\n- Screening length denominator: $Z_1^{0.23} + Z_2^{0.23} = 5^{0.23} + 14^{0.23} \\approx 1.431 + 1.843 = 3.274$. So, $a_U(\\text{B}) \\propto \\frac{1}{3.274}$.\n- Reduced energy: $\\epsilon(\\text{B}) \\propto \\frac{a_U E_{\\mathrm{cm}}}{Z_1 Z_2} \\propto \\frac{1}{3.274} \\frac{14.36}{5 \\times 14} \\approx 0.0628$ (in some arbitrary units).\n\n**System 2: $20\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ As in Si**\n- $Z_1 = 33$, $M_1 = 75\\,\\mathrm{amu}$\n- $Z_2 = 14$, $M_2 = 28\\,\\mathrm{amu}$\n- Center-of-mass energy: $E_{\\mathrm{cm}}(\\text{As}) = (20\\,\\mathrm{keV}) \\frac{28}{75 + 28} = (20\\,\\mathrm{keV})\\frac{28}{103} \\approx 5.44\\,\\mathrm{keV}$.\n- Screening length denominator: $Z_1^{0.23} + Z_2^{0.23} = 33^{0.23} + 14^{0.23} \\approx 2.215 + 1.843 = 4.058$. So, $a_U(\\text{As}) \\propto \\frac{1}{4.058}$.\n- Reduced energy: $\\epsilon(\\text{As}) \\propto \\frac{a_U E_{\\mathrm{cm}}}{Z_1 Z_2} \\propto \\frac{1}{4.058} \\frac{5.44}{33 \\times 14} \\approx 0.00288$ (in the same units as for B).\n\n**Comparison:**\n1.  **Reduced Energy**: $\\epsilon(\\text{As}) \\approx 0.0029$ is significantly smaller than $\\epsilon(\\text{B}) \\approx 0.063$. This places both ions on the low-energy, rising portion of the universal $s_n(\\epsilon)$ curve, where $s_n$ is an increasing function of $\\epsilon$. Therefore, $s_n(\\epsilon(\\text{As}))  s_n(\\epsilon(\\text{B}))$.\n2.  **Interaction Strength**: The strength of the interaction is primarily governed by the term $Z_1 Z_2$. For As, $Z_1 Z_2 = 33 \\times 14 = 462$, while for B, $Z_1 Z_2 = 5 \\times 14 = 70$. The Arsenic ion has a much stronger fundamental Coulomb interaction with the Silicon target.\n3.  **Overall Stopping Power**: The nuclear stopping power $S_n$ depends on the product of a pre-factor dominated by $Z_1Z_2$ and the reduced stopping cross-section $s_n(\\epsilon)$.\n    $$ S_n \\propto (Z_1 Z_2 a_U \\frac{M_1}{M_1+M_2}) \\cdot s_n(\\epsilon) $$\n    Let's compare the pre-factors:\n    - Pre-factor(B) $\\propto (70) \\times (\\frac{1}{3.274}) \\times (\\frac{11}{39}) \\approx 6.04$\n    - Pre-factor(As) $\\propto (462) \\times (\\frac{1}{4.058}) \\times (\\frac{75}{103}) \\approx 82.8$\n    The pre-factor for As is over an order of magnitude larger than for B. Although $s_n(\\epsilon(\\text{As}))$ is smaller than $s_n(\\epsilon(\\text{B}))$, the enormous difference in the pre-factor overwhelmingly dominates the final result.\n\nTherefore, $S_n$ for As in Si is substantially larger than for B in Si at an energy of $20\\,\\mathrm{keV}$. A larger $S_n$ implies a more rapid loss of energy per unit path length, leading to a shorter projected range ($R_p$). Furthermore, at these low energies (relative to the energy where electronic stopping peaks), nuclear stopping is the dominant energy loss mechanism for heavy ions like As. For the lighter, faster B ion, electronic stopping ($S_e$, which is proportional to velocity at low velocities) will be more significant, meaning the fraction of total stopping attributable to nuclear events, $S_n / (S_n + S_e)$, will be higher for As.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $S_n$ for $20\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ As in Si is larger than for $20\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ B in Si because the product $Z_1 Z_2$ is larger and the reduced energy is smaller for As, placing As deeper in the strong nuclear interaction regime; consequently, As exhibits a shorter projected range and a higher fraction of nuclear stopping in the total energy loss.**\nThis statement is fully consistent with the derivation. $S_n$ for As is indeed larger. The reasoning provided is correct: the larger $Z_1 Z_2$ product and the smaller reduced energy $\\epsilon$ for As are the key physical factors. A low $\\epsilon$ signifies the regime where nuclear stopping is strong. The consequences—a shorter range and a higher fraction of nuclear stopping for As—are direct and correct physical implications.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. $S_n$ for $20\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ B exceeds that for As because B has a larger center-of-mass energy fraction and higher velocity at the same laboratory energy, which increases the frequency of binary collisions under the ZBL potential; therefore, B has a shorter projected range.**\nThe primary claim, \"$S_n$ for B exceeds that for As\", is incorrect. While it is true that B has a higher velocity and a larger $E_{\\mathrm{cm}}$ fraction, this leads to a larger $\\epsilon$, shifting it towards a regime where nuclear stopping becomes less efficient relative to the pre-factors. The conclusion of a shorter projected range for B is also factually incorrect for implants at this energy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The nuclear stopping powers are approximately equal because the ZBL screening suppresses the dependence on $Z_1$ at $20\\,\\mathrm{keV}$, making $S_n$ effectively insensitive to the ion species at fixed energy.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The derivation shows a significant difference between the two stopping powers. The ZBL model explicitly depends on $Z_1$ through the interaction strength ($Z_1 Z_2$), the screening length ($a_U$), and the reduced energy ($\\epsilon$). Screening modifies the $Z_1$ dependence but does not eliminate it; in fact, the dependence on $Z_1$ is critical to the outcome.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. $S_n$ for As is smaller than for B because the smaller screening length $a_U$ for As reduces the effective interaction range, and the larger mass of As reduces the frequency of Coulomb deflections, leading to weaker nuclear stopping.**\nThe initial claim, \"$S_n$ for As is smaller than for B\", is incorrect. The reasoning is also flawed. While the screening length $a_U$ is indeed smaller for As, this does not singularly lead to weaker stopping due to the competing, dominant effect of the $Z_1 Z_2$ pre-factor. The claim that a larger mass reduces the frequency of deflections is physically misleading; the slower, heavier ion experiences a more effective momentum transfer per collision.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",

Integrating this from the initial energy $E_{0}$ to the final energy $0$ gives the range:\n$$\nR_{p} = \\int_{0}^{R_{p}} dx = \\int_{E_{0}}^{0} \\frac{-dE}{S(E)} = \\int_{0}^{E_{0}} \\frac{dE}{S(E)}\n$$\nSubstituting the given expression for $S(E)$:\n$$\nR_{p} = \\int_{0}^{E_{0}} \\frac{dE}{a\\sqrt{E} + \\frac{b}{\\sqrt{E}}}\n$$\n\nThe longitudinal straggle $\\Delta R_{p}$ is the standard deviation of the range distribution. Its square, the variance $(\\Delta R_{p})^2$, is derived from the propagation of fluctuations in energy loss. The variance of energy loss per unit path length is given as $\\Lambda(E) = \\alpha S(E)$, with $\\alpha = 2700 \\,\\text{eV}$. The differential contribution to the range variance is given by $d(\\sigma^2) = \\frac{\\Lambda(E)}{S(E)^3} dE$. Integrating this over the energy loss process yields the total variance:\n$$\n(\\Delta R_{p})^2 = \\int_{0}^{E_{0}} \\frac{\\Lambda(E)}{S(E)^3} dE = \\int_{0}^{E_{0}} \\frac{\\alpha S(E)}{S(E)^3} dE = \\alpha \\int_{0}^{E_{0}} \\frac{dE}{S(E)^2}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $S(E)$:\n$$\n(\\Delta R_{p})^2 = \\alpha \\int_{0}^{E_{0}} \\frac{dE}{\\left(a\\sqrt{E} + \\frac{b}{\\sqrt{E}}\\right)^2}\n$$\nThus, the longitudinal straggle is:\n$$\n\\Delta R_{p} = \\sqrt{\\alpha \\int_{0}^{E_{0}} \\frac{dE}{\\left(a\\sqrt{E} + \\frac{b}{\\sqrt{E}}\\right)^2}}\n$$\n\nNext, we evaluate these integrals analytically.\nFor $R_{p}$, the integral is:\n$$\nR_{p} = \\int_{0}^{E_{0}} \\frac{\\sqrt{E}}{aE + b} dE\n$$\nLet's use the substitution $u = \\sqrt{E}$, which implies $E=u^2$ and $dE = 2u \\, du$. The limits of integration become $u=0$ to $u=\\sqrt{E_{0}}$.\n$$\nR_{p} = \\int_{0}^{\\sqrt{E_{0}}} \\frac{u}{au^2 + b} (2u \\, du) = 2 \\int_{0}^{\\sqrt{E_{0}}} \\frac{u^2}{au^2 + b} du\n$$\nWe perform algebraic division on the integrand:\n$$\n\\frac{u^2}{au^2 + b} = \\frac{1}{a} \\left( \\frac{au^2 + b - b}{au^2 + b} \\right) = \\frac{1}{a} \\left( 1 - \\frac{b}{au^2 + b} \\right)\n$$\nThe integral becomes:\n$$\nR_{p} = \\frac{2}{a} \\int_{0}^{\\sqrt{E_{0}}} \\left( 1 - \\frac{b}{au^2 + b} \\right) du = \\frac{2}{a} \\left[ \\int_{0}^{\\sqrt{E_{0}}} du - b \\int_{0}^{\\sqrt{E_{0}}} \\frac{du}{au^2 + b} \\right]\n$$\nThe second integral is a standard form: $\\int \\frac{dx}{c^2x^2+d^2} = \\frac{1}{cd}\\arctan(\\frac{cx}{d})$. Here, $c=\\sqrt{a}$ and $d=\\sqrt{b}$.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\sqrt{E_{0}}} \\frac{du}{au^2 + b} = \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{ab}} \\arctan\\left(u\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{b}}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{\\sqrt{E_{0}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{ab}} \\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{aE_{0}}{b}}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting back, we obtain the expression for $R_{p}$:\n$$\nR_{p} = \\frac{2}{a} \\left[ \\sqrt{E_{0}} - b \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{ab}} \\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{aE_{0}}{b}}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{2}{a} \\left[ \\sqrt{E_{0}} - \\sqrt{\\frac{b}{a}} \\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{aE_{0}}{b}}\\right) \\right]\n$$\n\nFor $(\\Delta R_{p})^2$, the integral is:\n$$\n(\\Delta R_{p})^2 = \\alpha \\int_{0}^{E_{0}} \\frac{E}{(aE + b)^2} dE\n$$\nUsing the same substitution $u=\\sqrt{E}$:\n$$\n(\\Delta R_{p})^2 = \\alpha \\int_{0}^{\\sqrt{E_{0}}} \\frac{u^2}{(au^2 + b)^2} (2u \\, du) = 2\\alpha \\int_{0}^{\\sqrt{E_{0}}} \\frac{u^3}{(au^2 + b)^2} du\n$$\nThis integral can be solved using integration by parts, $\\int v \\, dw = vw - \\int w \\, dv$.

Near $E=0$, the stopping power is dominated by the nuclear term, $S(E) \\approx b/\\sqrt{E}$.\nThe integrand for $R_p$ behaves as $f_{1}(E) \\approx \\sqrt{E}/b$. Its derivative $f'_{1}(E) \\approx 1/(2b\\sqrt{E})$ is singular at $E=0$.\nThe integrand for $(\\Delta R_p)^2$ behaves as $f_{2}(E) \\approx E/b^2$. This function and its low-order derivatives are well-behaved at $E=0$.\nThe singularity in the derivative of $f_1(E)$ will slow the convergence of standard quadrature rules.\n1.  **Change of Variables**: To handle the singularity, we apply the substitution $E=u^2$, so $dE = 2u \\, du$. The integrals become $\\int_0^{\\sqrt{E_0}} \\frac{2u}{S(u^2)} du$ and $\\alpha \\int_0^{\\sqrt{E_0}} \\frac{2u}{S(u^2)^2} du$. This transformation regularizes the integrand for $R_p$, as the new integrand $2u/S(u^2) \\approx 2u/(b/u) = 2u^2/b$ is a smooth function at $u=0$.\n2.  **Quadrature Family**: With smooth integrands on a finite interval $[0, \\sqrt{E_0}]$, high-order methods are most efficient. Gauss-Legendre quadrature is an optimal choice, as it provides the highest degree of precision for a given number of function evaluations (requiring a linear mapping of $[0, \\sqrt{E_0}]$ to $[-1, 1]$).\n3.  **Order Selection**: Instead of selecting a fixed order, it is best to use an adaptive quadrature routine or a sequence of increasing-order rules (e.g., of order $N=8, 16, 32, \\dots$). The integration is repeated with progressively higher orders until the difference between successive results falls below a specified tolerance, ensuring the desired accuracy is achieved. This is more robust than picking a fixed order a priori.\n\nThe question requires the numerical values for $R_p$ and $\\Delta R_p$.\n$R_{p} = 237.8 \\, \\text{nm}$\n$\\Delta R_{p} = 59.51 \\, \\text{nm}$",
