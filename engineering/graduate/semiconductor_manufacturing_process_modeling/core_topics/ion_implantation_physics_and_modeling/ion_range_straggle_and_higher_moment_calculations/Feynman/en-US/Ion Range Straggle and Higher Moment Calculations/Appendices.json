            "problem": "A silicon wafer is implanted with light ions such that channeling is suppressed by a suitable pre-amorphization and tilt.

            "solution": "The user wants to solve a problem about ion implantation. A full validation of the problem statement is required before proceeding.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Electronic stopping power: $S_{e}(E) \\propto v(E)$\n- Nuclear stopping power: $S_{n}(E) \\propto \\sqrt{E}$\n- Ion speed at kinetic energy $E$: $v(E)$\n- Total stopping power definition: $S(E) \\equiv -\\,dE/dx$\n- Total stopping power composition: $S(E) = S_{e}(E) + S_{n}(E)$\n- Projected range definition: $R_{p}(E_{0}) \\equiv \\int_{0}^{E_{0}} \\frac{dE}{S(E)}$\n- Implantation energy: $E_{0}$\n- Kinematic relation for an ion of mass $m$: $v(E) = \\sqrt{2E/m}$\n- Calibration data: At $E_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{keV}$, the measured projected range is $R_{p}(E_{\\mathrm{ref}}) = 67\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n- Target for prediction: Calculate $R_{p}$ at $E_{0} = 75\\,\\mathrm{keV}$.\n- Additional task: Qualitatively describe the dependence of longitudinal straggle and higher moments on $E_{0}$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the validation criteria.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on the Lindhard-Scharff-Schiøtt (LSS) theory for ion stopping, which is a cornerstone of ion implantation modeling. The assumptions $S_e \\propto v(E)$ and $S_n \\propto \\sqrt{E}$ are well-established approximations for light ions in specific energy regimes. The integral definition for range is fundamental to transport theory. The problem is scientifically sound within its stated approximations.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear a priori model for stopping power, a definition for the quantity to be calculated ($R_p$), and a calibration data point. This setup is sufficient and self-contained, allowing for a unique, stable solution.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative terms, with clearly defined variables and relationships, free of subjective language.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe first step is to derive an explicit functional form for the total stopping power, $S(E)$. The problem states that the electronic stopping power $S_e(E)$ is proportional to the ion speed $v(E)$, and the nuclear stopping power $S_n(E)$ is proportional to the square root of the ion kinetic energy $E$. We can write these as:\n$S_e(E) = k_e v(E)$\n$S_n(E) = k_n \\sqrt{E}$\nwhere $k_e$ and $k_n$ are proportionality constants.\n\nThe problem provides the non-relativistic kinematic relation between speed and energy for an ion of mass $m$:\n$v(E) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2E}{m}}$\n\nWe substitute this expression for $v(E)$ into the equation for $S_e(E)$:\n$S_e(E) = k_e \\sqrt{\\frac{2E}{m}} = \\left( k_e \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{m}} \\right) \\sqrt{E}$\n\nThis shows that under the given assumptions, the electronic stopping power $S_e(E)$ is also proportional to $\\sqrt{E}$. Let's define a new constant $c_e = k_e \\sqrt{2/m}$. Then, $S_e(E) = c_e \\sqrt{E}$.\n\nThe total stopping power $S(E)$ is the sum of the electronic and nuclear components:\n$S(E) = S_e(E) + S_n(E) = c_e \\sqrt{E} + k_n \\sqrt{E} = (c_e + k_n)\\sqrt{E}$\n\nLet's combine the constants into a single effective proportionality constant $C = c_e + k_n$. The total stopping power is thus:\n$S(E) = C \\sqrt{E}$\n\nNow we can calculate the projected range $R_p$ for an initial implantation energy $E_0$ using the provided integral definition:\n$R_p(E_0) = \\int_{0}^{E_0} \\frac{dE}{S(E)} = \\int_{0}^{E_0} \\frac{dE}{C\\sqrt{E}}$\n\nWe can evaluate this integral:\n$R_p(E_0) = \\frac{1}{C} \\int_{0}^{E_0} E^{-1/2} \\, dE = \\frac{1}{C} \\left[ \\frac{E^{1/2}}{1/2} \\right]_{0}^{E_0} = \\frac{1}{C} [2\\sqrt{E}]_{0}^{E_0} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{E_0}}{C}$\n\nThis is the key symbolic relation for the projected range. It shows that, under the given assumptions, the projected range $R_p$ scales with the square root of the implantation energy $E_0$:\n$R_p(E_0) \\propto \\sqrt{E_0}$\n\nTo make a numerical prediction, we do not need to find the value of $C$. Instead, we can use the scaling relationship and the provided calibration data point. Let $K = 2/C$ be the overall constant of proportionality, such that $R_p(E_0) = K\\sqrt{E_0}$. We can form a ratio:\n$\\frac{R_p(E_0)}{R_p(E_{\\mathrm{ref}})} = \\frac{K\\sqrt{E_0}}{K\\sqrt{E_{\\mathrm{ref}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{E_0}{E_{\\mathrm{ref}}}}$\n\nThis allows us to calculate the projected range at the new energy $E_0 = 75\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ using the reference values $E_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ and $R_p(E_{\\mathrm{ref}}) = 67\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n$R_p(75\\,\\mathrm{keV}) = R_p(20\\,\\mathrm{keV}) \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{75\\,\\mathrm{keV}}{20\\,\\mathrm{keV}}}$\n$R_p(75\\,\\mathrm{keV}) = (67\\,\\mathrm{nm}) \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{75}{20}} = (67\\,\\mathrm{nm}) \\times \\sqrt{3.75}$\n$R_p(75\\,\\mathrm{keV}) \\approx (67\\,\\mathrm{nm}) \\times 1.93649167 \\approx 129.74494\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\n\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the predicted projected range is $129.7\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nFinally, a brief qualitative comment on the dependence of longitudinal straggle and higher moments on the implantation energy $E_0$ is required. The moments of the depth distribution (range, straggle, skewness, etc.) are determined by the statistical nature of the ion's energy loss process, which consists of a large number of discrete collisions.\n\n1.  **Longitudinal Straggle ($\\Delta R_p$)**: This is the second central moment (variance $\\Delta R_p^2$) of the depth distribution, measuring its width. The variance is a result of statistical fluctuations in the number and character of collisions. A simple application of the central limit theorem suggests that the variance in the total energy loss is proportional to the mean path length, and thus to the range $R_p$. Therefore, one would expect $\\Delta R_p^2 \\propto R_p$. Since we found $R_p \\propto \\sqrt{E_0}$, this implies that the variance scales as $\\Delta R_p^2 \\propto \\sqrt{E_0}$, and the straggle itself scales as $\\Delta R_p \\propto E_0^{1/4}$. The straggle increases with implantation energy, but more slowly than the range. This means the relative straggle, $\\Delta R_p / R_p \\propto E_0^{1/4} / E_0^{1/2} = E_0^{-1/4}$, decreases as energy increases. The distribution becomes relatively narrower at higher energies.\n\n2.  **Higher Moments (Skewness $\\gamma_1$, Kurtosis $\\kappa$)**: Skewness (third moment) describes the asymmetry of the distribution, while kurtosis (fourth moment) describes its \"tailedness\". For ion implantation, the distribution is typically asymmetric (skewed) due to the possibility of a few large-angle nuclear scattering events that can significantly shorten an ion's path, creating a tail toward the surface. As the implantation energy $E_0$ increases, the total number of collisions an ion undergoes also increases significantly. According to the central limit theorem, the sum of a large number of independent random variables (the energy losses in individual collisions) will tend toward a normal (Gaussian) distribution. A Gaussian distribution is perfectly symmetric ($\\gamma_1 = 0$) and has zero excess kurtosis ($\\kappa = 0$). Therefore, as $E_0$ increases, the ion distribution is expected to become more Gaussian-like. This implies that the magnitudes of both the skewness and the excess kurtosis will decrease with increasing implantation energy, approaching zero in the high-energy limit.",

All necessary parameters and initial conditions are provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested: first, the derivation of the second angular moment $\\langle \\theta^{2}(z)\\rangle$; second, the derivation of the relationship between the lateral straggle $\\sigma_{y}(z)$ and the scattering power $T(z)$; and third, the numerical evaluation of the lateral straggle at depth $z=L$.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Second Angular Moment $\\langle \\theta^{2}(z)\\rangle$**\n\nThe problem provides the differential relationship for the second moment of the angular distribution:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}\\langle \\theta^{2}(z)\\rangle = T(z)\\,\\mathrm{d}z $$\nTo find the second angular moment $\\langle \\theta^{2}(z)\\rangle$ at a depth $z$, we integrate this expression from the surface ($s=0$) to the depth $z$.\n$$ \\int_{\\langle \\theta^{2}(0)\\rangle}^{\\langle \\theta^{2}(z)\\rangle} \\mathrm{d}\\langle \\theta^{2}(s)\\rangle = \\int_{0}^{z} T(s)\\,\\mathrm{d}s $$\nThe initial condition for an initially collimated beam is $\\langle \\theta^{2}(0)\\rangle = 0$. Thus, the expression becomes:\n$$ \\langle \\theta^{2}(z)\\rangle = \\int_{0}^{z} T(s)\\,\\mathrm{d}s $$\nWe are given the scattering power $T(z) = T_{0}(1 + \\alpha z)$. Substituting this into the integral:\n$$ \\langle \\theta^{2}(z)\\rangle = \\int_{0}^{z} T_{0}(1 + \\alpha s)\\,\\mathrm{d}s = T_{0} \\int_{0}^{z} (1 + \\alpha s)\\,\\mathrm{d}s $$\nPerforming the integration yields:\n$$ \\langle \\theta^{2}(z)\\rangle = T_{0} \\left[ s + \\frac{\\alpha s^{2}}{2} \\right]_{0}^{z} = T_{0} \\left( (z + \\frac{\\alpha z^{2}}{2}) - 0 \\right) $$\nThe explicit expression for the second angular moment is therefore:\n$$ \\langle \\theta^{2}(z)\\rangle = T_{0} \\left( z + \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha z^{2} \\right) $$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Lateral Straggle $\\sigma_{y}(z)$**\n\nThe lateral straggle is defined as $\\sigma_{y}(z) = \\sqrt{\\langle y^{2}(z)\\rangle - \\langle y(z)\\rangle^{2}}$. First, we determine the mean lateral displacement $\\langle y(z)\\rangle$. Using the provided kinematic relation $y(z) = \\int_{0}^{z}\\theta(s)\\,\\mathrm{d}s$ and the linearity of the expectation operator:\n$$ \\langle y(z) \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\int_{0}^{z}\\theta(s)\\,\\mathrm{d}s \\right\\rangle = \\int_{0}^{z}\\langle \\theta(s) \\rangle\\,\\mathrm{d}s $$\nThe beam is initially collimated with zero mean angle, $\\langle \\theta(0) \\rangle = 0$. The problem states that all subsequent stochastic angular increments have zero mean. Consequently, the mean angle remains zero at all depths, $\\langle \\theta(z) \\rangle = 0$ for $z \\ge 0$. The mean lateral displacement is therefore zero:\n$$ \\langle y(z) \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{z} 0 \\,\\mathrm{d}s = 0 $$\nWith a zero mean displacement, the lateral straggle squared, $\\sigma_{y}^{2}(z)$, simplifies to the mean square lateral displacement, $\\langle y^{2}(z)\\rangle$:\n$$ \\sigma_{y}^{2}(z) = \\langle y^{2}(z)\\rangle $$\nWe calculate $\\langle y^{2}(z)\\rangle$ by squaring the kinematic relation and taking the expectation value:\n$$ \\langle y^{2}(z) \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\left( \\int_{0}^{z}\\theta(s)\\,\\mathrm{d}s \\right) \\left( \\int_{0}^{z}\\theta(s')\\,\\mathrm{d}s' \\right) \\right\\rangle = \\int_{0}^{z}\\int_{0}^{z} \\langle \\theta(s)\\theta(s') \\rangle \\,\\mathrm{d}s\\,\\mathrm{d}s' $$\nThe term $\\langle \\theta(s)\\theta(s') \\rangle$ is the angular correlation function. For uncorrelated, zero-mean angular increments, this function is given by $\\langle \\theta(s)\\theta(s') \\rangle = \\langle \\theta^{2}(\\min(s, s')) \\rangle$. The integral can be simplified by exploiting symmetry:\n$$ \\langle y^{2}(z) \\rangle = 2 \\int_{0}^{z} \\mathrm{d}s \\int_{0}^{s} \\langle \\theta^{2}(s') \\rangle \\,\\mathrm{d}s' $$\nA standard identity for iterated integrals, $\\int_0^z \\int_0^s f(t) dt ds = \\int_0^z (z-t) f(t) dt$, allows us to write:\n$$ \\langle y^{2}(z) \\rangle = 2 \\int_{0}^{z} (z-s) \\langle \\theta^{2}(s) \\rangle \\,\\mathrm{d}s $$\nTo relate this to the scattering power $T(z)$, we use integration by parts. Let $u = \\langle \\theta^{2}(s) \\rangle$ and $dv = (z-s)\\,\\mathrm{d}s$. Then $du = (\\mathrm{d}\\langle \\theta^{2}(s) \\rangle / \\mathrm{d}s)\\,\\mathrm{d}s = T(s)\\,\\mathrm{d}s$ and $v = -(z-s)^{2}/2$.\n$$ \\int_{0}^{z} (z-s) \\langle \\theta^{2}(s) \\rangle \\,\\mathrm{d}s = \\left[ -\\langle \\theta^{2}(s) \\rangle \\frac{(z-s)^{2}}{2} \\right]_{0}^{z} - \\int_{0}^{z} \\left(-\\frac{(z-s)^{2}}{2}\\right) T(s) \\,\\mathrm{d}s $$\nThe boundary term evaluates to zero at $s=z$ because of the $(z-s)^{2}$ factor and at $s=0$ because $\\langle \\theta^{2}(0) \\rangle = 0$. This leaves:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{z} (z-s) \\langle \\theta^{2}(s) \\rangle \\,\\mathrm{d}s = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{z} (z-s)^{2} T(s) \\,\\mathrm{d}s $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\langle y^{2}(z) \\rangle$:\n$$ \\langle y^{2}(z) \\rangle = 2 \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{z} (z-s)^{2} T(s) \\,\\mathrm{d}s \\right) = \\int_{0}^{z} (z-s)^{2} T(s) \\,\\mathrm{d}s $$\nThus, the explicit relation for the lateral straggle is:\n$$ \\sigma_{y}(z) = \\sqrt{\\int_{0}^{z} (z-s)^{2} T(s) \\,\\mathrm{d}s} $$\n\n**Part 3: Evaluation of the Lateral Straggle $\\sigma_{y}(L)$**\n\nWe now evaluate $\\sigma_{y}(z)$ at the depth $z=L$ using the given scattering power $T(z) = T_{0}(1 + \\alpha z)$.\n$$ \\sigma_{y}^{2}(L) = \\int_{0}^{L} (L-s)^{2} T_{0}(1 + \\alpha s) \\,\\mathrm{d}s $$\nTo simplify the integration, let $u = L-s$, which implies $s = L-u$ and $\\mathrm{d}s = -\\mathrm{d}u$. The limits of integration change from $s=0$ to $u=L$ and $s=L$ to $u=0$.\n$$ \\sigma_{y}^{2}(L) = T_{0} \\int_{L}^{0} u^{2} (1 + \\alpha(L-u)) (-\\mathrm{d}u) = T_{0} \\int_{0}^{L} u^{2} (1 + \\alpha L - \\alpha u) \\,\\mathrm{d}u $$\n$$ \\sigma_{y}^{2}(L) = T_{0} \\int_{0}^{L} ((1+\\alpha L)u^{2} - \\alpha u^{3}) \\,\\mathrm{d}u $$\nIntegrating with respect to $u$:\n$$ \\sigma_{y}^{2}(L) = T_{0} \\left[ (1+\\alpha L)\\frac{u^{3}}{3} - \\alpha \\frac{u^{4}}{4} \\right]_{0}^{L} $$\nEvaluating at the limits:\n$$ \\sigma_{y}^{2}(L) = T_{0} \\left( (1+\\alpha L)\\frac{L^{3}}{3} - \\alpha \\frac{L^{4}}{4} \\right) = T_{0} \\left( \\frac{L^{3}}{3} + \\frac{\\alpha L^{4}}{3} - \\frac{\\alpha L^{4}}{4} \\right) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{y}^{2}(L) = T_{0} \\left( \\frac{L^{3}}{3} + \\frac{\\alpha L^{4}}{12} \\right) = T_{0}L^{3}\\left(\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{\\alpha L}{12}\\right) $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $T_{0} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{rad}^{2}/\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, $\\alpha = 1.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$, and $L = 0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n$$ \\alpha L = (1.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1})(0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}) = 0.5 $$\n$$ \\sigma_{y}^{2}(L) = (5.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{rad}^{2}/\\mu\\mathrm{m}) (0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m})^{3} \\left(\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{0.5}{12}\\right) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{y}^{2}(L) = (5.0 \\times 10^{-3}) (0.125) \\left(\\frac{4}{12} + \\frac{0.5}{12}\\right) \\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{y}^{2}(L) = (5.0 \\times 10^{-3}) (0.125) \\left(\\frac{4.5}{12}\\right) \\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2} = (5.0 \\times 10^{-3}) (0.125) \\left(\\frac{3}{8}\\right) \\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{y}^{2}(L) = (5.0 \\times 10^{-3}) (0.046875) \\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2} = 0.000234375 \\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2} = 2.34375 \\times 10^{-4} \\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2} $$\nThe lateral straggle $\\sigma_{y}(L)$ is the square root of this value:\n$$ \\sigma_{y}(L) = \\sqrt{2.34375 \\times 10^{-4} \\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}} \\approx 1.53093 \\times 10^{-2} \\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in nanometers ($1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{nm}$).\n$$ \\sigma_{y}(L) \\approx 1.53093 \\times 10^{-2} \\times 1000 \\,\\mathrm{nm} \\approx 15.3093 \\,\\mathrm{nm} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$ \\sigma_{y}(L) \\approx 15.3 \\,\\mathrm{nm} $$",
