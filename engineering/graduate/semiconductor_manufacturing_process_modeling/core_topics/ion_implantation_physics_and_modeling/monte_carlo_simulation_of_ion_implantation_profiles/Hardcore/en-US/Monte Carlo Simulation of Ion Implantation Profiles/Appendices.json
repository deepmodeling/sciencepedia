            "problem": "In the Binary Collision Approximation (BCA) used in Monte Carlo simulations of ion implantation, nuclear stopping is modeled as a sequence of independent, elastic, two-body collisions between an incident ion and target atoms. Consider a phosphorus ion of kinetic energy $E_{0} = 20\\,\\text{keV}$ incident on a silicon atom at rest in the laboratory frame. Assume nonrelativistic kinematics, point-like particles, elastic scattering, and neglect electronic stopping during the collision.

Round the energy to four significant figures. Provide your final answer as two quantities in the order listed.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for a derivation of the maximum fractional energy transfer in an elastic two-body collision, and then to apply this result to a specific case of a phosphorus ion colliding with a silicon atom.\n\nLet $M_1$ and $v_1$ be the mass and initial velocity of the projectile (phosphorus ion) in the laboratory (lab) frame. Let $M_2$ be the mass of the target atom (silicon), which is initially at rest, so its initial velocity is $v_2=0$. The initial kinetic energy of the projectile is $E_0 = \\frac{1}{2} M_1 v_1^2$.\n\nThe fundamental principles governing this interaction are the conservation of linear momentum and the conservation of kinetic energy (since the collision is elastic).\nIn the lab frame, these are expressed as:\n$$M_1 \\vec{v}_1 = M_1 \\vec{v}_1' + M_2 \\vec{v}_2' \\quad (\\text{Conservation of Momentum})$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2} M_1 v_1^2 = \\frac{1}{2} M_1 |\\vec{v}_1'|^2 + \\frac{1}{2} M_2 |\\vec{v}_2'|^2 \\quad (\\text{Conservation of Energy})$$\nwhere $\\vec{v}_1'$ and $\\vec{v}_2'$ are the final velocities of the projectile and target in the lab frame, respectively.\n\nThe analysis is simplified by transforming to the center-of-mass (CM) reference frame. The velocity of the CM, $\\vec{V}_{CM}$, is constant and given by:\n$$\\vec{V}_{CM} = \\frac{M_1 \\vec{v}_1 + M_2 \\vec{v}_2}{M_1 + M_2} = \\frac{M_1}{M_1 + M_2} \\vec{v}_1$$\nThe initial velocities of the particles in the CM frame, $\\vec{u}_1$ and $\\vec{u}_2$, are:\n$$\\vec{u}_1 = \\vec{v}_1 - \\vec{V}_{CM} = \\vec{v}_1 - \\frac{M_1}{M_1 + M_2} \\vec{v}_1 = \\frac{M_2}{M_1 + M_2} \\vec{v}_1$$\n$$\\vec{u}_2 = \\vec{v}_2 - \\vec{V}_{CM} = 0 - \\frac{M_1}{M_1 + M_2} \\vec{v}_1 = -\\frac{M_1}{M_1 + M_2} \\vec{v}_1$$\nIn the CM frame, the total momentum is zero by definition. For an elastic collision, the kinetic energy is conserved, which implies that the speeds of the particles in the CM frame do not change. Their final velocities, $\\vec{u}_1'$ and $\\vec{u}_2'$, are related to their initial velocities by a rotation through the CM scattering angle, $\\theta_{CM}$. Thus, $|\\vec{u}_1'| = |\\vec{u}_1|$ and $|\\vec{u}_2'| = |\\vec{u}_2|$.\n\nThe energy transferred to the target atom is its final kinetic energy in the lab frame, $\\Delta E = \\frac{1}{2} M_2 |\\vec{v}_2'|^2$. The final lab-frame velocity of the target, $\\vec{v}_2'$, is obtained by transforming back from the CM frame:\n$$\\vec{v}_2' = \\vec{u}_2' + \\vec{V}_{CM}$$\nThe magnitude squared of this velocity is:\n$$|\\vec{v}_2'|^2 = (\\vec{u}_2' + \\vec{V}_{CM}) \\cdot (\\vec{u}_2' + \\vec{V}_{CM}) = |\\vec{u}_2'|^2 + |\\vec{V}_{CM}|^2 + 2 \\vec{u}_2' \\cdot \\vec{V}_{CM}$$\nWe have $|\\vec{u}_2'| = |\\vec{u}_2| = \\frac{M_1}{M_1+M_2} v_1$ and $|\\vec{V}_{CM}| = \\frac{M_1}{M_1+M_2} v_1$.\nThe vector $\\vec{V}_{CM}$ is parallel to the initial projectile velocity $\\vec{v}_1$. The vector $\\vec{u}_2$ is anti-parallel to $\\vec{v}_1$. In the CM frame, $\\vec{u}_2'$ is the vector $\\vec{u}_2$ rotated by the angle $\\theta_{CM}$. Therefore, the angle between $\\vec{u}_2'$ and $\\vec{u}_2$ is $\\theta_{CM}$. Since $\\vec{V}_{CM}$ is anti-parallel to $\\vec{u}_2$, the angle between $\\vec{u}_2'$ and $\\vec{V}_{CM}$ is $\\pi - \\theta_{CM}$.\nThe dot product is $\\vec{u}_2' \\cdot \\vec{V}_{CM} = |\\vec{u}_2'| |\\vec{V}_{CM}| \\cos(\\pi - \\theta_{CM}) = -|\\vec{u}_2'| |\\vec{V}_{CM}| \\cos(\\theta_{CM})$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $|\\vec{v}_2'|^2$:\n$$|\\vec{v}_2'|^2 = |\\vec{u}_2'|^2 + |\\vec{V}_{CM}|^2 - 2 |\\vec{u}_2'| |\\vec{V}_{CM}| \\cos(\\theta_{CM})$$\n$$|\\vec{v}_2'|^2 = \\left(\\frac{M_1 v_1}{M_1+M_2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{M_1 v_1}{M_1+M_2}\\right)^2 - 2 \\left(\\frac{M_1 v_1}{M_1+M_2}\\right)^2 \\cos(\\theta_{CM})$$\n$$|\\vec{v}_2'|^2 = 2 \\left(\\frac{M_1 v_1}{M_1+M_2}\\right)^2 (1 - \\cos(\\theta_{CM}))$$\nUsing the trigonometric identity $1 - \\cos(\\theta_{CM}) = 2 \\sin^2(\\frac{\\theta_{CM}}{2})$:\n$$|\\vec{v}_2'|^2 = 4 \\left(\\frac{M_1 v_1}{M_1+M_2}\\right)^2 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta_{CM}}{2}\\right)$$\nThe energy transferred, $\\Delta E$, is then:\n$$\\Delta E = \\frac{1}{2} M_2 |\\vec{v}_2'|^2 = \\frac{1}{2} M_2 \\left[ 4 \\left(\\frac{M_1 v_1}{M_1+M_2}\\right)^2 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta_{CM}}{2}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{2 M_1^2 M_2}{(M_1+M_2)^2} v_1^2 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta_{CM}}{2}\\right)$$\nThe fractional energy transfer, $T$, is the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta E}{E_0}$:\n$$T(\\theta_{CM}) = \\frac{\\Delta E}{E_0} = \\frac{\\frac{2 M_1^2 M_2}{(M_1+M_2)^2} v_1^2 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta_{CM}}{2}\\right)}{\\frac{1}{2} M_1 v_1^2} = \\frac{4 M_1 M_2}{(M_1+M_2)^2} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta_{CM}}{2}\\right)$$\nThe maximum fractional energy transfer, $\\gamma$, occurs when $\\sin^2(\\frac{\\theta_{CM}}{2})$ is at its maximum value of $1$. This happens when $\\frac{\\theta_{CM}}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, which means $\\theta_{CM} = \\pi$ radians. A CM scattering angle of $\\pi$ corresponds to a head-on collision, where the projectile reverses its direction in the CM frame.\nTherefore, the maximum fraction of energy that can be transferred is:\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{4 M_1 M_2}{(M_1+M_2)^2}$$\nThis completes the required derivation.\n\nNow, we apply these results to the given problem.\nThe givens are:\nProjectile (Phosphorus): $M_1 = 31\\,\\text{u}$\nTarget (Silicon): $M_2 = 28.085\\,\\text{u}$\nInitial projectile energy: $E_0 = 20\\,\\text{keV}$\n\n1) Calculate the maximum recoil energy, $\\Delta E_{max}$.\nFirst, we calculate the maximum energy transfer coefficient, $\\gamma$:\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{4(31)(28.085)}{(31+28.085)^2} = \\frac{3482.54}{(59.085)^2} = \\frac{3482.54}{3491.037225} \\approx 0.9975658$$\nThe maximum recoil energy is $\\Delta E_{max} = \\gamma E_0$.\n$$\\Delta E_{max} = 0.9975658 \\times 20\\,\\text{keV} \\approx 19.951316\\,\\text{keV}$$\nRounding this value to four significant figures, we obtain:\n$$\\Delta E_{max} = 19.95\\,\\text{keV}$$\n\n2) Determine the center-of-mass scattering angle for a head-on collision.\nAs established in the derivation, the maximum energy transfer corresponds to a head-on collision. This occurs when the scattering angle in the center-of-mass frame is $\\theta_{CM} = \\pi$ radians. In this scenario, the projectile and target recede along the same line they approached on, but in opposite directions.\n\nThus, the two requested quantities are $19.95\\,\\text{keV}$ and $\\pi$ radians.",
