Within the Binary Collision Approximation (BCA), model the interaction as a two-body elastic collision governed by conservation of linear momentum and kinetic energy. Using these fundamentals, first derive the maximum energy $T_{\\max}$ that can be transferred to the silicon atom in a head-on collision. Next, under Rutherford kinematics for elastic scattering, assume the scattering is characterized by the center-of-mass scattering angle $\\theta$ and derive the angular dependence of the transferred energy $T(\\theta)$. For a grazing collision with $\\theta=5^\\circ$, compute the energy transferred to the silicon atom, and then report the ratio $R=T(\\theta)/T_{\\max}$ as a dimensionless number.

            "solution": "The Binary Collision Approximation (BCA) models the ion–target interaction as a two-body elastic collision where the target atom is initially at rest. The base principles are conservation of linear momentum and conservation of kinetic energy. Let the projectile (arsenic) have mass $m_1$ and initial speed $v$, so its initial kinetic energy is $E_0=\\frac{1}{2}m_1 v^2$. The target (silicon) has mass $m_2$ and is initially at rest.\n\nMaximum energy transfer occurs in a head-on, one-dimensional elastic collision. For such a collision, solving the conservation laws yields the well-known post-collision velocities\n$$\nv_1'=\\frac{m_1-m_2}{m_1+m_2}\\,v,\\qquad\nv_2'=\\frac{2m_1}{m_1+m_2}\\,v,\n$$\nwhere $v_1'$ and $v_2'$ are the projectile and target velocities after the collision. The energy transferred to the target (the recoil energy) is\n$$\nT_{\\max}=\\frac{1}{2}m_2\\,v_2'^2=\\frac{1}{2}m_2\\left(\\frac{2m_1}{m_1+m_2}v\\right)^2\n= \\frac{4 m_1 m_2}{(m_1+m_2)^2}\\,\\frac{1}{2}m_1 v^2\n= \\frac{4 m_1 m_2}{(m_1+m_2)^2}\\,E_0.\n$$\nThis shows the head-on kinematic factor $\\frac{4 m_1 m_2}{(m_1+m_2)^2}$ multiplies the incident energy.\n\nFor a general elastic scattering under a central force (Rutherford kinematics), it is convenient to work in the center-of-mass (CM) frame. In the CM frame, the magnitudes of the velocities are unchanged by the collision; only directions are rotated by the CM scattering angle $\\theta$. The geometry of the momentum change in the CM frame implies that the energy transferred to the target in the laboratory frame scales with $\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ relative to the head-on maximum. Specifically, the recoil energy as a function of the CM scattering angle is\n$$\nT(\\theta) = T_{\\max}\\,\\sin^2\\!\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right),\n$$\nwhich recovers $T(0)=0$ (no scattering) and $T(\\pi)=T_{\\max}$ (backscattering in CM).\n\nWe now compute the numerical values.

The total path length traveled by the ion from its initial energy $E_0$ until it comes to rest ($E=0$) is defined as the CSDA range, $R(E_0)$. To find this range, we can separate variables in the defining equation:\n$$dx = -\\frac{dE}{S(E)}$$\nWe then integrate the path length $x$ from $0$ to $R$ as the energy $E$ decreases from $E_0$ to $0$:\n$$\\int_{0}^{R} dx = \\int_{E_0}^{0} \\left(-\\frac{1}{S(E)}\\right) dE$$\nEvaluating the left-hand side gives $R$.

            "problem": "An ion implantation step introduces boron into crystalline silicon. Consider a single incident boron ion of kinetic energy $E_0 = 15\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ entering silicon and initiating a collision cascade under the Binary Collision Approximation (BCA). In BCA, each binary collision between a moving atom and a target atom transfers energy $T$ from the projectile to the target, and a target atom is displaced (creating a new mobile Primary Knock-on Atom (PKA)) if $T \\geq E_d$, where $E_d$ is the displacement threshold energy. Assume the following physically grounded modeling framework:\n\n- The cascade branching is modeled as a Galton–Watson process in which each PKA independently produces an integer number of offspring equal to the count of subsequent above-threshold displacements it causes while it slows down.\n- The mean offspring count for a PKA is determined by the available damage energy relative to $E_d$. Specifically, adopt the Norgett–Robinson–Torrens (NRT) efficiency factor for displacement production so that the mean number of displacements per PKA is $0.4$ times the ratio of its available damage energy to $E_d$.\n- The available damage energy for the initial $15\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ boron ion in silicon is a fixed fraction of its kinetic energy, given by the nuclear damage energy fraction $\\chi$.

            "solution": "The problem describes a Galton-Watson branching process, where each individual (a PKA) produces a random number of offspring. The process starts with a single individual ($Z_0 = 1$), the incident boron ion. The extinction probability, $q$, is the probability that the lineage of this individual eventually dies out.\n\nFor a Galton-Watson process, the extinction probability $q$ is the smallest non-negative root of the equation $s = G(s)$, where $G(s)$ is the probability generating function (PGF) of the offspring distribution. The offspring count is given to follow a Poisson distribution with a certain mean $\\mu$.\n\nThe PGF for a Poisson distribution with mean $\\mu$ is given by:\n$$\nG(s) = E[s^X] = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} s^k P(X=k) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} s^k \\frac{\\mu^k e^{-\\mu}}{k!} = e^{-\\mu} \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(s\\mu)^k}{k!} = e^{-\\mu} e^{s\\mu} = \\exp(\\mu(s-1))\n$$\nFirst, we must calculate the mean number of offspring, $\\mu$.

Since $\\mu = 100 > 1$, the argument $z = -100\\exp(-100)$ lies in this interval.\n    The solution corresponding to the trivial root $q=1$ is found on the $W_{-1}$ branch, as $W_{-1}(-\\mu e^{-\\mu}) = -\\mu$.\n    The extinction probability $q$ corresponds to the principal branch, $W_0(z)$:\n    $$\n    -\\mu q = W_0(-\\mu e^{-\\mu}) \\implies q = -\\frac{1}{\\mu} W_0(-\\mu e^{-\\mu})\n    $$\n    Substituting $\\mu = 100$:\n    $$\n    q = -\\frac{1}{100} W_0(-100 \\exp(-100))\n    $$\n    The argument $x = -100 \\exp(-100)$ is an extremely small negative number.

The approximation for $q$ would then be $q \\approx \\exp(-100) + 100\\exp(-200)$. The correction term is of the order of $10^{-85}$, while the primary term is of the order of $10^{-44}$. Thus, the first-order approximation $q \\approx \\exp(-100)$ is exceedingly accurate.\n\n4.  **Calculate the numerical value and round**.\n    We need to compute the numerical value of $\\exp(-100)$ and round it to four significant figures.\n    $$\n    \\exp(-100) \\approx 3.720075976 \\times 10^{-44}\n    $$\n    Rounding this result to four significant figures gives $3.720 \\times 10^{-44}$.
