            "introduction": "Understanding how an energetic ion loses energy in a solid is the cornerstone of implantation physics. This energy loss is partitioned between two distinct mechanisms: nuclear stopping ($S_n$) from collisions with target atoms and electronic stopping ($S_e$) from interactions with target electrons. This practice provides a quantitative exercise in comparing these two channels, allowing you to calculate the critical energy at which their contributions are equal and to appreciate why their relative importance changes with ion velocity.

            "problem": "An ion implantation model partitions the stopping power into an electronic contribution and a nuclear contribution. For a projectile ion of boron ($B^{+}$) implanted into crystalline silicon, the stopping power is defined as $S(E) = -\\mathrm{d}E/\\mathrm{d}x$ and is decomposed as $S(E) = S_{e}(E) + S_{n}(E)$, where $S_{e}(E)$ and $S_{n}(E)$ denote the electronic stopping and nuclear stopping, respectively. Within the Binary Collision Approximation (BCA), and guided by Lindhard–Scharff–Schiøtt (LSS) theory and Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter (SRIM) data fits, consider the following parameterized curves for $B^{+}$ in silicon, valid over the energy interval $0.5\\,\\mathrm{keV} \\leq E \\leq 50\\,\\mathrm{keV}$:\n$$\nS_{e}(E) = \\alpha\\,\\frac{\\sqrt{E}}{1+\\beta\\,\\sqrt{E}},\\qquad\nS_{n}(E) = \\gamma\\,\\frac{\\sqrt{E}}{1+\\delta\\,E},\n$$\nwhere $E$ is the ion kinetic energy in $\\mathrm{keV}$, and the fit parameters are $\\alpha = $ $1.8$, $\\beta = $ $0.08\\,\\mathrm{keV}^{-1/2}$, $\\gamma = $ $5.0$, and $\\delta = $ $0.5\\,\\mathrm{keV}^{-1}$.

Round your final numerical result to three significant figures and express the final energy in $\\mathrm{keV}$.\n\nThen, interpret the physical significance of this transition using collision kinematics for binary interactions between a moving ion of mass $M_{1}$ and a stationary target atom of mass $M_{2}$ and between the ion and target electrons, explaining qualitatively why the dominance shifts from nuclear to electronic stopping with increasing $E$ over this energy range.

These are discrete, large-angle scattering events that can transfer significant kinetic energy and displace target atoms from their lattice sites, creating crystalline defects. This process is most efficient at lower ion velocities, where the interaction time between the ion and a target nucleus is long enough for substantial momentum exchange. The provided model $S_n \\propto \\sqrt{E}/(1+\\delta E)$ correctly reflects that nuclear stopping first increases with energy but then decreases at higher energies as the ion's speed becomes too great for efficient interaction with the heavy, slow-to-respond nuclei.\n\n2.  **Electronic Stopping ($S_e$)**: This mechanism involves inelastic collisions between the projectile ion and the electrons of the target material. The ion excites or ionizes target atoms, losing energy in a continuous, viscous drag-like manner. These interactions result in minimal deviation of the ion's path (small-angle scattering). For the low-velocity regime relevant here, LSS theory predicts that $S_e$ is proportional to the ion velocity, i.e., $S_e \\propto v \\propto \\sqrt{E}$. The given model $S_e \\propto \\sqrt{E}/(1+\\beta\\sqrt{E})$ captures this initial rise and a subsequent leveling-off.\n\nThe crossover energy $E^{\\star} \\approx 4.50\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ is the kinetic energy at which these two energy loss mechanisms have equal magnitude for a boron ion in silicon.\n-   For energies $E  E^{\\star}$, nuclear stopping is the dominant process ($S_n > S_e$). Projectiles in this regime undergo significant scattering and are highly effective at creating lattice damage.\n-   For energies $E > E^{\\star}$, electronic stopping becomes the dominant process ($S_e > S_n$). Projectiles travel along straighter trajectories and lose most of their energy to the target's electronic system, generating less displacement damage per unit path length compared to the low-energy regime.\n\nThis transition is fundamental in ion implantation, as it dictates the resulting implant profile (ion depth distribution) and the nature and extent of the induced crystal damage, which must be subsequently repaired by thermal annealing.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for the number of stable Frenkel pairs, or displacements ($N_{d}$), produced by a single $10\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ arsenic ion incident on crystalline silicon, according to two different models: the Kinchin–Pease (KP) model and the Norgett–Robinson–Torrens (NRT) model.\n\nThe solution is based on the principle of conservation of energy. The total kinetic energy of the incident ion, $E_{0}$, is partitioned into energy lost to electronic excitations (inelastic collisions) and energy transferred to target atoms, causing them to recoil (elastic collisions). Only the latter, known as the damage energy, is available to create atomic displacements.\n\nFirst, we must determine the total damage energy, $E_{\\mathrm{damage}}$, which is the portion of the incident ion's energy that contributes to atomic displacements. The problem provides the incident ion's kinetic energy, $E_{0} = 10\\,\\mathrm{keV}$, and the average fraction of this energy that becomes damage energy, $f_{d} = 0.70$.\n\nWe convert the incident energy to electron volts ($\\mathrm{eV}$) for consistency with the threshold displacement energy, $E_{d}$.\n$$E_{0} = 10\\,\\mathrm{keV} = 10 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 10000\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\nThe damage energy is then calculated as:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{damage}} = f_{d} \\times E_{0} = 0.70 \\times 10000\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 7000\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\nThis value of $E_{\\mathrm{damage}}$ is the total energy available to create a cascade of atomic displacements.

It assumes a hard-sphere collision cascade and posits that for a damage energy $E_{\\mathrm{damage}}$ significantly larger than $E_{d}$, the number of displacements is given by:\n$$N_{d}^{\\mathrm{KP}} = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{damage}}}{2 E_{d}}$$\nThis formula is valid for $E_{\\mathrm{damage}} \\ge 2 E_{d}$. The factor of $2$ in the denominator arises from the assumption that, on average, a recoiling atom expends an energy of $E_{d}$ to displace itself and loses an additional $E_{d}$ in the process, making the average cost per displacement $2 E_{d}$.\n\nLet's verify the condition for using this formula. We have $E_{\\mathrm{damage}} = 7000\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and $E_{d} = 15\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n$$2 E_{d} = 2 \\times 15\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 30\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\nSince $7000\\,\\mathrm{eV} > 30\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, the condition is met.

It introduces a displacement efficiency factor to better account for the dynamics within a dense cascade, including prompt athermal recombination of vacancies and interstitials. The NRT standard formula for the number of displacements, $N_{d}^{\\mathrm{NRT}}$, is:\n$$N_{d}^{\\mathrm{NRT}} = \\frac{0.8 \\times E_{\\mathrm{damage}}}{2 E_{d}}$$\nThe factor of $0.8$ represents the displacement efficiency, modifying the simpler KP estimate. This model is generally considered more accurate for describing displacement damage in crystalline materials.\n\nUsing the same values for $E_{\\mathrm{damage}}$ and $E_{d}$:\n$$N_{d}^{\\mathrm{NRT}} = \\frac{0.8 \\times 7000\\,\\mathrm{eV}}{2 \\times 15\\,\\mathrm{eV}} = \\frac{5600}{30} = \\frac{560}{3} \\approx 186.666...$$\nThis can also be seen as $N_{d}^{\\mathrm{NRT}} = 0.8 \\times N_{d}^{\\mathrm{KP}}$.\n$$N_{d}^{\\mathrm{NRT}} = 0.8 \\times \\frac{700}{3} \\approx 0.8 \\times 233.333... \\approx 186.666...$$\nRounding this result to three significant figures gives:\n$$N_{d}^{\\mathrm{NRT}} \\approx 187$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer as an ordered pair $\\left(N_{d}^{\\mathrm{KP}},\\,N_{d}^{\\mathrm{NRT}}\\right)$ with values rounded to three significant figures.
