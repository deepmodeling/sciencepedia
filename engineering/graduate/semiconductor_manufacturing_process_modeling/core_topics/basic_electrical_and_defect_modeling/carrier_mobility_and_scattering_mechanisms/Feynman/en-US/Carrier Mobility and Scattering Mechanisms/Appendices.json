Let $\\mu_{\\text{total}}$ be the total mobility, $\\mu_{\\text{ph}}$ be the phonon-limited mobility, and $\\mu_{\\text{alloy}}$ be the alloy-scattering-limited mobility.

The problem states that the variance of the random alloy potential is proportional to the product $x(1-x)$, where $x$ is the mole fraction of Germanium. In scattering theory (e.g., via Fermi's Golden Rule), the scattering rate is proportional to the square of the scattering potential matrix element, which in turn is proportional to the variance of the potential fluctuations.

At this high effective field, surface roughness ($\\mu_{\\mathrm{sr}} \\approx 653\\ \\mathrm{cm^2 \\cdot V^{-1} \\cdot s^{-1}}$) is the strongest scattering mechanism, followed by surface phonons ($\\mu_{\\mathrm{sp}} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{cm^2 \\cdot V^{-1} \\cdot s^{-1}}$). As expected, the combined mobility $\\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is lower than the lowest individual mobility component.",
