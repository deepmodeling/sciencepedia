The analysis is based on fundamental principles of charge transport in semiconductors.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the conductivity mobility $\\mu$.\nThe drift current density $\\vec{J}$ is defined as the net flow of charge per unit area per unit time. For an $n$-type semiconductor where the contribution from holes is negligible, the current is carried predominantly by electrons. The charge density of these mobile electrons is $\\rho = -nq$, where $n$ is the free-electron density and $q$ is the elementary charge. The current density is then given by:\n$$\n\\vec{J} = \\rho \\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{d}} = (-nq) \\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{d}}\n$$\nwhere $\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{d}}$ is the average drift velocity of the electrons.\n\nIn the low-field drift regime, the drift velocity of electrons is directly proportional to the applied electric field $\\vec{E}$. The constant of proportionality is the electron mobility, $\\mu$. Since electrons have negative charge, they drift in the direction opposite to the electric field.

The transport is within the $(001)$ plane, so the z-component is zero. The unit vector is $\\mathbf{u}_{\\langle 110\\rangle} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1^2+1^2+0^2}}(1, 1, 0)^T = (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, 0)^T$.\nSubstituting $u_x=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$, $u_y=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$, $u_z=0$:\n$$ \\mu_{\\langle 110\\rangle} = e\\tau\\left(\\frac{(1/\\sqrt{2})^2}{m_l} + \\frac{(1/\\sqrt{2})^2}{m_t} + \\frac{0^2}{m_t}\\right) = e\\tau\\left(\\frac{1}{2m_l} + \\frac{1}{2m_t}\\right) = \\frac{e\\tau}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{m_l} + \\frac{1}{m_t}\\right) $$\nNow, we compute the ratio $\\mathcal{R}$:\n$$ \\mathcal{R} = \\frac{\\mu_{\\langle 110\\rangle}}{\\mu_{\\langle 100\\rangle}} = \\frac{\\frac{e\\tau}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{m_l} + \\frac{1}{m_t}\\right)}{\\frac{e\\tau}{m_l}} $$\nThe term $e\\tau$ cancels:\n$$ \\mathcal{R} = \\frac{m_l}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{m_l} + \\frac{1}{m_t}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 + \\frac{m_l}{m_t}\\right) $$\nWe are given $m_{l}=0.916\\,m_{0}$ and $m_{t}=0.190\\,m_{0}$. The free-electron mass $m_0$ cancels in the ratio:\n$$ \\frac{m_l}{m_t} = \\frac{0.916}{0.190} \\approx 4.8210526... $$\nSubstituting this value into the expression for $\\mathcal{R}$:\n$$ \\mathcal{R} = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + 4.8210526...) = \\frac{5.8210526...}{2} = 2.9105263... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\mathcal{R} \\approx 2.911$.\n\n**Part 3: Implications for Transistor Layout**\n\nThe calculated ratio $\\mathcal{R} \\approx 2.911$ indicates that the electron mobility in the $[110]$ direction is nearly three times greater than the mobility in the $[100]$ direction for this specific strained silicon configuration. The drive current ($I_{DS}$) of a MOSFET is directly proportional to the carrier mobility in the channel. Consequently, a higher mobility leads to a higher drive current, which in turn enables faster device switching speeds and improved transistor performance.\n\nTherefore, this significant anisotropy in mobility would strongly inform the layout of transistors on the $(001)$ silicon wafer. To maximize performance, an integrated circuit designer would align the transistor channel, which is the path of current flow from the source to the drain, with the $\\langle 110 \\rangle$ crystallographic direction. This choice leverages the direction of highest carrier mobility to achieve the highest possible drive current and operating frequency for the given material system, assuming other factors like scattering mechanisms are not strongly orientation-dependent. This is a fundamental consideration in semiconductor process design for optimizing device performance in advanced logic technologies.",
