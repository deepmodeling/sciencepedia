            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of electron transport in a semiconductor under the influence of both a concentration gradient and an external electric field. The total electron current density, $J_n$, is the sum of the drift component, $J_{n, \\text{drift}}$, due to the electric field, and the diffusion component, $J_{n, \\text{diff}}$, due to the concentration gradient.\n\nFor a one-dimensional system along the $x$-axis, these current densities are given by:\n$$J_{n, \\text{drift}}(x) = q\\,n(x)\\,\\mu_{n}\\,E_x(x)$$\n$$J_{n, \\text{diff}}(x) = q\\,D_{n}\\,\\frac{dn(x)}{dx}$$\nwhere $q$ is the elementary charge, $n(x)$ is the electron concentration, $\\mu_{n}$ is the electron mobility, $E_x(x)$ is the electric field, and $D_{n}$ is the electron diffusion coefficient. We assume $\\mu_n$ and $D_n$ are constant in the specified region, which is reasonable for light doping and a small concentration variation.\n\n**1. Condition for Diffusion Dominance**\n\nThe first task is to derive the condition for which the magnitude of the diffusion term is greater than the magnitude of the drift term. This is expressed by the inequality:\n$$\\lvert J_{n, \\text{diff}} \\rvert > \\lvert J_{n, \\text{drift}} \\rvert$$\nSubstituting the definitions for the current densities:\n$$\\left\\lvert q\\,D_{n}\\,\\frac{dn}{dx} \\right\\rvert > \\lvert q\\,n\\,\\mu_{n}\\,E_x \\rvert$$\nSince $q$, $D_{n}$, $n(x)$, and $\\mu_{n}$ are all positive quantities, we can simplify this to:\n$$D_{n} \\left\\lvert \\frac{dn}{dx} \\right\\rvert > n(x)\\,\\mu_{n}\\,\\lvert E_x \\rvert$$\nIn a one-dimensional problem, the gradient $\\nabla n$ is simply $\\frac{dn}{dx}\\hat{x}$, so its magnitude is $\\lvert \\frac{dn}{dx} \\rvert$. We can rewrite the inequality in terms of the general vector quantities $\\nabla n$ and $E$:\n$$D_{n} \\lvert \\nabla n \\rvert > n\\,\\mu_{n}\\,\\lvert E \\rvert$$\nTo proceed, we invoke the Einstein relation, a fundamental result from statistical mechanics that holds for nondegenerate carriers in thermal equilibrium. The problem states the wafer is nondegenerate and near equilibrium at a temperature $T$, so its use is justified. The Einstein relation connects the diffusion coefficient $D_n$ to the mobility $\\mu_n$:\n$$D_{n} = \\mu_{n} \\frac{k_{B}T}{q}$$\nwhere $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. Substituting this into our inequality gives:\n$$\\left(\\mu_{n} \\frac{k_{B}T}{q}\\right) \\lvert \\nabla n \\rvert > n\\,\\mu_{n}\\,\\lvert E \\rvert$$\nSince the mobility $\\mu_n$ is non-zero, we can divide both sides by it:\n$$\\frac{k_{B}T}{q} \\lvert \\nabla n \\rvert > n \\lvert E \\rvert$$\nSolving for the magnitude of the electric field $\\lvert E \\rvert$, we find the condition for diffusion dominance:\n$$\\lvert E \\rvert < \\frac{k_{B}T}{q} \\frac{\\lvert \\nabla n \\rvert}{n}$$\nThis is the required condition of the form $\\lvert E \\rvert < E_c$, where the threshold field $E_c$ is given by:\n$$E_{c} = \\frac{k_{B}T}{q} \\frac{\\lvert \\nabla n \\rvert}{n}$$\nThe term $V_{th} = k_B T / q$ is known as the thermal voltage.\n\n**2. Evaluation of the Ratio R**\n\nThe second task is to compute the dimensionless ratio $R$ at the midpoint of the region, $x=L/2$. The ratio is defined as:\n$$R \\equiv \\frac{\\lvert q D_{n} \\nabla n \\rvert}{\\lvert q\\, n\\, \\mu_{n}\\, E \\rvert}$$\nGiven that all quantities are positive, this can be written as:\n$$R = \\frac{D_{n} \\lvert \\nabla n \\rvert}{n\\, \\mu_{n}\\, \\lvert E \\rvert}$$\nUsing the Einstein relation $D_{n} = \\mu_{n} (k_{B}T/q)$, we can simplify the expression for $R$ by canceling $\\mu_n$:\n$$R = \\frac{(\\mu_{n} k_{B}T/q) \\lvert \\nabla n \\rvert}{n\\, \\mu_{n}\\, \\lvert E \\rvert} = \\frac{k_{B}T}{q} \\frac{\\lvert \\nabla n \\rvert}{n \\lvert E \\rvert}$$\nNow we must evaluate the terms in this expression at $x=L/2$ using the given data.\n\nFirst, we determine the electron concentration profile $n(x)$. The problem states local charge neutrality, so $n(x) \\approx N_D(x)$. The donor profile $N_D(x)$ is linear:\n$$N_D(x) = N_D(0) + \\frac{N_D(L) - N_D(0)}{L} x$$\nSo, $n(x)$ is also linear. The gradient $\\nabla n$ is the derivative with respect to $x$, which is constant throughout the region:\n$$\\nabla n = \\frac{dn}{dx} = \\frac{n(L) - n(0)}{L} \\approx \\frac{N_D(L) - N_D(0)}{L}$$\nUsing the given values:\n$N_D(0) = 1.0 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\n$N_D(L) = 1.5 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\n$L = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 10 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n$$\\nabla n = \\frac{(1.5 \\times 10^{15} - 1.0 \\times 10^{15})\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{cm}} = \\frac{0.5 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{cm}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{17}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-4}$$\nSince this is positive, $\\lvert \\nabla n \\rvert = 5.0 \\times 10^{17}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-4}$.\n\nNext, we find the electron concentration $n$ at the midpoint, $x=L/2$:\n$$n(L/2) = n(0) + \\frac{n(L) - n(0)}{L} \\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) = \\frac{n(0) + n(L)}{2}$$\n$$n(L/2) \\approx \\frac{N_D(0) + N_D(L)}{2} = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{15} + 1.5 \\times 10^{15})\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}}{2} = 1.25 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$$\n\nThe thermal voltage at $T=300\\,\\mathrm{K}$ is:\n$$\\frac{k_B T}{q} \\approx \\frac{(1.3806 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K})(300\\,\\mathrm{K})}{1.6022 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}} \\approx 0.02585\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nThe magnitude of the applied electric field is given as $\\lvert E \\rvert = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{V/cm}$.\n\nNow we can substitute all the numerical values into the expression for $R$:\n$$R = (0.02585\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{17}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-4}}{(1.25 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3})(2.0\\,\\mathrm{V/cm})}$$\n$$R = \\frac{0.02585 \\times 5.0 \\times 10^{17}}{2.5 \\times 10^{15}} = \\frac{0.12925 \\times 10^{17}}{2.5 \\times 10^{15}}$$\n$$R = 0.0517 \\times 10^{2} = 5.17$$\nThe calculation confirms that the units cancel out, resulting in a dimensionless ratio. Rounding to three significant figures, the value is $5.17$. The provided electron mobility $\\mu_{n} = 1350\\,\\mathrm{cm^{2}\\,V^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}$ is consistent with this result, as a separate calculation using it to find $D_n$ first would yield the same value for $R$, but the cancellation approach is more direct.",

            "solution": "### Derivation of the Governing Partial Differential Equation\n\nThe dynamics of the electron concentration $n(x,t)$ in one dimension are described by the electron continuity equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} = \\frac{1}{q} \\frac{\\partial J_n}{\\partial x} - U_n\n$$\nwhere $q$ is the elementary charge, $J_n$ is the electron current density, and $U_n$ is the net recombination rate per unit volume. The total electron concentration is the sum of the equilibrium concentration $n_0$ and the excess concentration $\\delta n$, so $n(x,t) = n_0 + \\delta n(x,t)$. Assuming a uniformly doped wafer, $n_0$ is constant in space and time. Thus, $\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial \\delta n}{\\partial t}$.\n\nThe problem states that for $t>0$, generation is zero ($G=0$) and the recombination is given by $R \\approx \\delta n/\\tau$. The net recombination rate is $U_n = R - G$, which simplifies to $U_n \\approx \\delta n/\\tau$. Substituting this into the continuity equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\delta n}{\\partial t} = \\frac{1}{q} \\frac{\\partial J_n}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\delta n}{\\tau}\n$$\nThe electron current density $J_n$ is given by the drift-diffusion model:\n$$\nJ_n = q n \\mu_n E + q D \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x}\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_n$ is the electron mobility and $D$ is the electron diffusion coefficient. According to the problem statement, the electric field is negligible ($E \\approx 0$). Also, since $n=n_0+\\delta n$ and $n_0$ is constant, we have $\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial \\delta n}{\\partial x}$. The current density becomes purely diffusive:\n$$\nJ_n = q D \\frac{\\partial \\delta n}{\\partial x}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $J_n$ back into the continuity equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\delta n}{\\partial t} = \\frac{1}{q} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( q D \\frac{\\partial \\delta n}{\\partial x} \\right) - \\frac{\\delta n}{\\tau}\n$$\nSince the diffusion coefficient $D$ is assumed to be constant, it can be taken out of the spatial derivative. This gives the final governing linear PDE for the excess minority carrier concentration:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\delta n}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 \\delta n}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{\\delta n}{\\tau}\n$$\n\n### Eigenmode Analysis and Solution\n\nTo solve this PDE, we use the method of separation of variables, assuming a solution of the form $\\delta n(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the PDE, we get:\n$$\nX(x) \\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = D T(t) \\frac{d^2X(x)}{dx^2} - \\frac{X(x)T(t)}{\\tau}\n$$\nDividing by $X(x)T(t)$ allows for the separation of variables:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T(t)} \\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = \\frac{D}{X(x)} \\frac{d^2X(x)}{dx^2} - \\frac{1}{\\tau}\n$$\nRearranging the terms, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T(t)}\\frac{dT(t)}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau} = \\frac{D}{X(x)}\\frac{d^2X(x)}{dx^2}\n$$\nThe left side depends only on time $t$, and the right side depends only on position $x$. For the equality to hold for all $x$ and $t$, both sides must be equal to a constant. We denote this separation constant by $-\\lambda_k$.\n\nThe temporal part of the equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T(t)}\\frac{dT(t)}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau} = -\\lambda_k \\implies \\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = -\\left(\\lambda_k + \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\right) T(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) with the solution:\n$$\nT(t) = T(0) \\exp\\left(-\\left(\\lambda_k + \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\right)t\\right)\n$$\nThis shows that each eigenmode decays exponentially with a time constant $\\tau_k = \\left(\\lambda_k + \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\right)^{-1}$.\n\nThe spatial part of the equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{D}{X(x)}\\frac{d^2X(x)}{dx^2} = -\\lambda_k \\implies \\frac{d^2X(x)}{dx^2} + \\frac{\\lambda_k}{D} X(x) = 0\n$$\nLet's define a wave number $k = \\sqrt{\\lambda_k/D}$. The spatial ODE becomes a standard Helmholtz equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2X(x)}{dx^2} + k^2 X(x) = 0\n$$\nThe general solution is $X(x) = A\\sin(kx) + B\\cos(kx)$. We apply the boundary conditions $\\delta n(0,t)=0$ and $\\delta n(L,t)=0$, which imply $X(0)=0$ and $X(L)=0$.\n- At $x=0$: $X(0) = A\\sin(0) + B\\cos(0) = B = 0$.\n- The solution reduces to $X(x) = A\\sin(kx)$.\n- At $x=L$: $X(L) = A\\sin(kL) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution ($A \\neq 0$), we require $\\sin(kL)=0$. This condition is met when $kL = m\\pi$, where $m$ is an integer.\nSince $m=0$ gives the trivial solution $X(x)=0$, and negative integers for $m$ are redundant, the allowed wave numbers are:\n$$\nk_m = \\frac{m\\pi}{L}, \\quad m = 1, 2, 3, \\dots\n$$\nThe corresponding eigenvalues $\\lambda_k$ are given by $\\lambda_m = D k_m^2$:\n$$\n\\lambda_m = D \\left(\\frac{m\\pi}{L}\\right)^2\n$$\nThe decay time constant for each eigenmode, characterized by the integer $m$, is:\n$$\n\\tau_m = \\left(\\lambda_m + \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\right)^{-1} = \\left(D \\left(\\frac{m\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\right)^{-1}\n$$\n\n### Dominant Settling Time\n\nThe general solution for $\\delta n(x,t)$ is a superposition of all possible eigenmodes:\n$$\n\\delta n(x,t) = \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} A_m \\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_m}\\right)\n$$\nThe coefficients $A_m$ depend on the initial concentration profile $\\delta n(x,0)$. The transient behavior is governed by the set of time constants $\\tau_m$. The dominant settling time is the largest of these time constants, as it corresponds to the slowest decaying component, which persists the longest. The largest $\\tau_m$ corresponds to the smallest denominator in its expression. The denominator, $D(m\\pi/L)^2 + 1/\\tau$, increases with $m$. Therefore, the smallest value occurs for the fundamental mode, $m=1$.\n\nThe dominant exponential settling time, $\\tau_{dom}$, is $\\tau_1$:\n$$\n\\tau_{dom} = \\left(D \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\right)^{-1}\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression.\n\n### Physical Interpretation: Diffusion vs. Recombination\nThe total decay rate for the dominant mode is $1/\\tau_{dom} = 1/\\tau_{diff} + 1/\\tau_{recomb}$, where we can define an effective diffusion lifetime $\\tau_{diff} = (D(\\pi/L)^2)^{-1} = L^2/(\\pi^2 D)$ and a bulk recombination lifetime $\\tau_{recomb} = \\tau$. The overall settling process is determined by the parallel combination of these two decay pathways. The faster rate (smaller time constant) dominates the overall rate.\n- **Diffusion-controlled limit**: If diffusion to the contacts is much faster than bulk recombination, then $\\tau_{diff} \\ll \\tau$. This corresponds to the condition $L^2/(\\pi^2 D) \\ll \\tau$, which is equivalent to the problem's heuristic condition $L^2/D \\ll \\tau$. In this case, $1/\\tau_{diff} \\gg 1/\\tau$, and the total rate is $1/\\tau_{dom} \\approx 1/\\tau_{diff}$. The settling time is $\\tau_{dom} \\approx \\tau_{diff} = L^2/(\\pi^2 D)$. The decay is limited by how fast carriers can diffuse to the boundary sinks.\n- **Recombination-controlled limit**: If bulk recombination is much faster than diffusion, then $\\tau \\ll \\tau_{diff}$. This corresponds to $\\tau \\ll L^2/D$. In this case, $1/\\tau \\gg 1/\\tau_{diff}$, and the total rate is $1/\\tau_{dom} \\approx 1/\\tau$. The settling time is $\\tau_{dom} \\approx \\tau$. The decay is limited by the bulk recombination lifetime, as carriers recombine before reaching the contacts.\nThus, comparing the characteristic diffusion time $L^2/D$ with the recombination time $\\tau$ provides a direct way to identify the rate-limiting mechanism.\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\nWe are given the following parameter values:\n- $L = 10~\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 10 \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{cm} = 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{cm}$\n- $D = 35~\\mathrm{cm^2/s}$\n- $\\tau = 0.5~\\mu\\mathrm{s} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{s}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the two competing rates:\n- Bulk recombination rate: $1/\\tau = 1/(0.5 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{s}) = 2.0 \\times 10^6~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n- Effective diffusion rate for the fundamental mode: $D(\\pi/L)^2 = (35~\\mathrm{cm^2/s}) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{10^{-3}~\\mathrm{cm}}\\right)^2 = 35 \\pi^2 \\times 10^6~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nUsing $\\pi \\approx 3.14159$, $\\pi^2 \\approx 9.8696$.\n$D(\\pi/L)^2 \\approx 35 \\times 9.8696 \\times 10^6~\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\approx 345.436 \\times 10^6~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nThe total decay rate is the sum of these two rates:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau_{dom}} = 2.0 \\times 10^6~\\mathrm{s}^{-1} + 345.436 \\times 10^6~\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 347.436 \\times 10^6~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe dominant settling time is the reciprocal of this rate:\n$$\n\\tau_{dom} = \\frac{1}{347.436 \\times 10^6~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \\approx 2.87823 \\times 10^{-9}~\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\n\\tau_{dom} = 2.878 \\times 10^{-9}~\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nAs observed from the rates, diffusion ($345.4 \\times 10^6~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$) is much faster than recombination ($2.0 \\times 10^6~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$), so the process is strongly diffusion-dominated. The settling time is very close to the diffusion lifetime $\\tau_{diff} = 1/(345.436 \\times 10^6~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\approx 2.895 \\times 10^{-9}~\\mathrm{s}$.",

The space charge density $\\rho$ in a semiconductor is given by $\\rho = q(p - n + N_D^+ - N_A^-)$, where $N_D^+$ and $N_A^-$ are the ionized donor and acceptor concentrations. Setting $\\rho=0$ gives the charge neutrality condition:\n    $$p - n + N_D^+ - N_A^- = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad n - p = N_D^+ - N_A^-$$\n    This condition states that the net mobile charge ($n-p$) must balance the net fixed dopant charge ($N_D^+ - N_A^-$).\n\nThese two conditions, combined with the Maxwell-Boltzmann relations that link carrier concentrations to the potentials ($n = n_i \\exp((\\varphi_n - \\phi)/V_T)$ and $p = n_i \\exp((\\phi - \\varphi_p)/V_T)$), form a complete set of equations. For a given metal potential $\\varphi_M$ and known doping ($N_D^+, N_A^-$), this system can be solved to find the unique boundary values for the electrostatic potential $\\phi$, electron concentration $n$, and hole concentration $p$. These values are then used as the Dirichlet boundary conditions.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options against this correct procedure:\n\n**A.** This option correctly prescribes setting $\\varphi_n = \\varphi_p = \\varphi_M$ (equilibrium) and then using a charge neutrality equation to solve for the remaining variables ($\\phi$, and subsequently $n$, and $p$). The stated neutrality equation, $p - n + N_A^- - N_D^+ = 0$, rearranges to $p - n = N_D^+ - N_A^-$, which correctly ensures that the total positive charge ($p+N_D^+$) equals the total negative charge ($n+N_A^-$). The procedure described is the correct one for establishing self-consistent, equilibrium, charge-neutral boundary conditions.\n\n**B.** This option is incorrect. It wrongly assumes intrinsic concentrations ($n=p=n_i$) for a doped semiconductor, which would violate charge neutrality. It also sets $\\phi$ arbitrarily without regard for the doping level.\n\n**C.** This option is incorrect. It uses approximations ($n=N_D^+, p=N_A^-$) that are only valid for bulk regions and ignores the law of mass action ($np=n_i^2$) that must hold at an equilibrium contact. The condition on $E_C - E_F$ is related to Schottky barriers, not ideal ohmic contacts.\n\n**D.** This option is incorrect as it explicitly describes the boundary conditions for a non-ideal, rectifying **Schottky contact**, which involves thermionic emission, a potential barrier, and non-equilibrium conditions ($\\varphi_n \\neq \\varphi_p$) under bias. This is the opposite of an ideal ohmic contact.\n\nTherefore, option A provides the only scientifically sound blueprint for an ideal ohmic contact among the choices.",
