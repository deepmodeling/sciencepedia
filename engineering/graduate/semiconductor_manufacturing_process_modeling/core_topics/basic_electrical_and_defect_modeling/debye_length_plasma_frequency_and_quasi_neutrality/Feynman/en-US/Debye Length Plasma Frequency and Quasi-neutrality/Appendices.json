            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the ratio of the small-signal screening lengths in intrinsic and extrinsic silicon regions. This screening length is the Debye length, which characterizes the distance over which a static electric field is screened out by mobile charge carriers. We will begin from first principles, namely Poisson's equation and Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics, for each case.\n\nLet the electrostatic potential be denoted by $\\phi$. In one dimension, Poisson's equation is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\rho}{\\varepsilon}\n$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the net space charge density and $\\varepsilon$ is the permittivity of the material. For silicon, $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0$, where $\\varepsilon_r$ is the relative permittivity and $\\varepsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity. The net space charge density is given by $\\rho = q(N_D^+ - N_A^- + p - n)$, where $q$ is the elementary charge, $N_D^+$ and $N_A^-$ are the concentrations of ionized donors and acceptors, and $p$ and $n$ are the concentrations of holes and electrons, respectively.\n\nUnder non-degenerate conditions, the carrier concentrations are related to the local electrostatic potential $\\phi$ and the thermal energy $k_B T$ via the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution:\n$$\nn = n_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{q\\phi}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\n$$\np = p_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{q\\phi}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $n_0$ and $p_0$ are the equilibrium concentrations in the quasi-neutral region where the reference potential is $\\phi=0$, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nWe analyze the system for small perturbations around equilibrium, which means $|q\\phi| \\ll k_B T$. This allows for the linearization of the exponential terms: $\\exp(u) \\approx 1 + u$ for small $u$.\n\n**1. Intrinsic Silicon Screening Length ($\\lambda_{D,\\mathrm{intrinsic}}$)**\n\nIn an intrinsic semiconductor, there are no dopants, so $N_D^+ = 0$ and $N_A^- = 0$. The equilibrium condition is charge neutrality, where the electron and hole concentrations are equal to the intrinsic carrier concentration, $n_0 = p_0 = n_i$.\n\nThe net charge density under a potential perturbation $\\phi$ is:\n$$\n\\rho = q(p - n) = q\\left(n_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{-q\\phi}{k_B T}\\right) - n_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{q\\phi}{k_B T}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nApplying the small-signal approximation for $|q\\phi| \\ll k_B T$:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(\\frac{-q\\phi}{k_B T}\\right) \\approx 1 - \\frac{q\\phi}{k_B T}\n$$\n$$\n\\exp\\left(\\frac{q\\phi}{k_B T}\\right) \\approx 1 + \\frac{q\\phi}{k_B T}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\rho$:\n$$\n\\rho \\approx qn_i \\left( \\left(1 - \\frac{q\\phi}{k_B T}\\right) - \\left(1 + \\frac{q\\phi}{k_B T}\\right) \\right) = qn_i \\left( -\\frac{2q\\phi}{k_B T} \\right) = -\\frac{2q^2n_i}{k_B T} \\phi\n$$\nNow, substitute this linearized charge density back into Poisson's equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^2} = -\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} \\left( -\\frac{2q^2n_i}{k_B T} \\phi \\right) = \\left( \\frac{2q^2n_i}{\\varepsilon k_B T} \\right) \\phi\n$$\nThis is the linearized Poisson equation. It has the form $\\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^2} = \\frac{\\phi}{\\lambda_D^2}$, where $\\lambda_D$ is the characteristic screening length. By comparison, we identify the intrinsic Debye length, $\\lambda_{D,\\mathrm{intrinsic}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{D,\\mathrm{intrinsic}}^2} = \\frac{2q^2n_i}{\\varepsilon k_B T}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{D,\\mathrm{intrinsic}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon k_B T}{2q^2n_i}}\n$$\nThis expression demonstrates that both electrons and holes contribute to screening in the intrinsic material.\n\n**2. Extrinsic n-type Silicon Screening Length ($\\lambda_{D,\\mathrm{extrinsic}}$)**\n\nIn the extrinsic n-type region, we assume full ionization of donors, so $N_D^+ = N_D$. The equilibrium electron concentration is $n_0 \\approx N_D$. The problem states that minority holes can be neglected, so we set $p=0$.\n\nThe net charge density under a potential perturbation $\\phi$ is:\n$$\n\\rho = q(N_D^+ - n) = q(N_D - n)\n$$\nThe electron concentration is $n = n_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{q\\phi}{k_B T}\\right) = N_D \\exp\\left(\\frac{q\\phi}{k_B T}\\right)$.\n$$\n\\rho = q\\left(N_D - N_D \\exp\\left(\\frac{q\\phi}{k_B T}\\right)\\right) = qN_D\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(\\frac{q\\phi}{k_B T}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nApplying the small-signal approximation for $|q\\phi| \\ll k_B T$:\n$$\n\\rho \\approx qN_D\\left(1 - \\left(1 + \\frac{q\\phi}{k_B T}\\right)\\right) = qN_D\\left(-\\frac{q\\phi}{k_B T}\\right) = -\\frac{q^2N_D}{k_B T} \\phi\n$$\nSubstituting this into Poisson's equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^2} = -\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} \\left( -\\frac{q^2N_D}{k_B T} \\phi \\right) = \\left( \\frac{q^2N_D}{\\varepsilon k_B T} \\right) \\phi\n$$\nComparing this to the form $\\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^2} = \\frac{\\phi}{\\lambda_D^2}$, we identify the extrinsic Debye length, $\\lambda_{D,\\mathrm{extrinsic}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{D,\\mathrm{extrinsic}}^2} = \\frac{q^2N_D}{\\varepsilon k_B T}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{D,\\mathrm{extrinsic}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon k_B T}{q^2N_D}}\n$$\nIn this case, only the majority carriers (electrons) contribute to the screening.\n\n**3. Ratio of the Screening Lengths ($R$)**\n\nWe are asked to compute the ratio $R = \\frac{\\lambda_{D,\\mathrm{intrinsic}}}{\\lambda_{D,\\mathrm{extrinsic}}}$.\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon k_B T}{2q^2n_i}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon k_B T}{q^2N_D}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon k_B T}{2q^2n_i} \\cdot \\frac{q^2N_D}{\\varepsilon k_B T}}\n$$\nMany terms cancel, leading to a simplified expression that depends only on the carrier concentrations:\n$$\nR = \\sqrt{\\frac{N_D}{2n_i}}\n$$\nThis result highlights that the screening length is inversely proportional to the square root of the mobile carrier concentration. Since the doped region has a much higher carrier concentration ($N_D$) than the intrinsic region ($2n_i$, accounting for both electrons and holes), its screening length will be significantly shorter, meaning it screens electric fields more effectively.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $R$ using the given data:\n- Intrinsic carrier concentration: $n_i = 1.0 \\times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$.\n- Donor concentration (approximating electron concentration): $N_D = 1.0 \\times 10^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$.\n\nSince both concentrations are given in the same units (cm$^{-3}$), the units will cancel in the ratio, and no conversion to SI units is necessary for this specific calculation.\n$$\nR = \\sqrt{\\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{16}}{2 \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{10})}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{10^{16}}{2 \\times 10^{10}}} = \\sqrt{0.5 \\times 10^{6}}\n$$\n$$\nR = \\sqrt{500000} \\approx 707.10678...\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to three significant figures.\n$$\nR \\approx 707\n$$\nIn standard scientific notation, this is $7.07 \\times 10^2$.",

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and well-posed. It describes a standard derivation of the plasma frequency in a solid-state plasma, a well-established concept in physics, and then requires a numerical calculation based on realistic parameters for doped silicon. All necessary data and constants are provided. Therefore, we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks to first derive the expression for the electron plasma angular frequency, $\\omega_{p}$, and then to compute the ratio of the plasma frequency to a given radio frequency.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Plasma Frequency $\\omega_{p}$**\n\nWe begin with the fundamental equations governing the dynamics of the electron fluid, as specified: Newton's second law, the charge continuity equation, and Gauss's law. We model the system as a uniform equilibrium density of free electrons, $n$, in a fixed, neutralizing background of positive charge. We consider a small, one-dimensional perturbation from this equilibrium.\n\nLet the equilibrium electron number density be $n_0$ (which is given as $n$ in the problem statement) and the equilibrium electron velocity be $\\mathbf{v}_0 = \\mathbf{0}$. We introduce small perturbations:\n- Electron density: $n(\\mathbf{r}, t) = n_0 + \\delta n(\\mathbf{r}, t)$\n- Electron fluid velocity: $\\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{r}, t) = \\mathbf{0} + \\delta \\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{r}, t)$\n- Electric field: $\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r}, t) = \\mathbf{0} + \\delta \\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r}, t)$\n\nFor simplicity, we drop the $\\delta$ and treat $n$, $v$, and $E$ as perturbation quantities, except for the zeroth-order density $n_0$.\n\n1.  **Newton's Second Law for the Electron Fluid:**\n    The force on an element of the electron fluid is due to the electric field created by charge separation. For a single electron with charge $-e$ and effective mass $m^{\\ast}$, Newton's law is $m^{\\ast} \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt} = -e\\mathbf{E}$. The total (or convective) derivative is $\\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{v}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{v}$. Since $\\mathbf{v}$ is a first-order small quantity, the $(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{v}$ term is second-order and can be neglected. This linearization yields:\n    $$m^{\\ast} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{v}}{\\partial t} = -e\\mathbf{E}$$\n\n2.  **Charge Continuity Equation:**\n    The continuity equation for charge is $\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{j} = 0$. The charge density is $\\rho = -en$ and the current density is $\\mathbf{j} = \\rho \\mathbf{v} = -en\\mathbf{v}$. Substituting these gives $\\frac{\\partial(-en)}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (-en\\mathbf{v}) = 0$, which simplifies to $\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (n\\mathbf{v}) = 0$.\n    We linearize this equation using $n(\\mathbf{r}, t) = n_0 + \\delta n(\\mathbf{r}, t)$.\n    $\\frac{\\partial (\\delta n)}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot ((n_0 + \\delta n)\\mathbf{v}) = 0$. Expanding and keeping only first-order terms ($n_0 \\mathbf{v}$), we get:\n    $$\\frac{\\partial (\\delta n)}{\\partial t} + n_0 (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) = 0$$\n\n3.  **Gauss's Law:**\n    Gauss's law relates the electric field to the net charge density, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{net}}$. The background medium has permittivity $\\epsilon$. The net charge density arises from the perturbation in the electron density, as the positive background is rigid: $\\rho_{\\mathrm{net}} = e(n_{ions}) - en = e n_0 - e(n_0 + \\delta n) = -e \\, \\delta n$.\n    Thus, Gauss's law is:\n    $$\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = \\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{net}}}{\\epsilon} = -\\frac{e \\, \\delta n}{\\epsilon}$$\n\nNow, we combine these three linearized equations to find the oscillation frequency. We take the time derivative of Gauss's law:\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E}) = -\\frac{e}{\\epsilon} \\frac{\\partial (\\delta n)}{\\partial t}$$\nWe can switch the order of differentiation on the left side. For the right side, we substitute the continuity equation, $\\frac{\\partial (\\delta n)}{\\partial t} = -n_0 (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v})$:\n$$\\nabla \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t}\\right) = -\\frac{e}{\\epsilon}(-n_0 (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v})) = \\frac{n_0 e}{\\epsilon}(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v})$$\nThis implies that $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t} = \\frac{n_0 e}{\\epsilon}\\mathbf{v}$, as we are considering longitudinal oscillations where the curl of the fields is zero.\nNext, we take another time derivative:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t^2} = \\frac{n_0 e}{\\epsilon} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{v}}{\\partial t}$$\nFinally, we substitute the linearized Newton's law, $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{v}}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{e}{m^{\\ast}}\\mathbf{E}$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t^2} = \\frac{n_0 e}{\\epsilon} \\left(-\\frac{e}{m^{\\ast}}\\mathbf{E}\\right) = -\\frac{n_0 e^2}{\\epsilon m^{\\ast}}\\mathbf{E}$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t^2} + \\frac{n_0 e^2}{\\epsilon m^{\\ast}}\\mathbf{E} = 0$$\nThis is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator. The square of the angular frequency of oscillation is the coefficient of the $\\mathbf{E}$ term. This is the electron plasma angular frequency, $\\omega_p$:\n$$\\omega_{p}^2 = \\frac{n_0 e^2}{\\epsilon m^{\\ast}}$$\nReplacing $n_0$ with the given symbol $n$ for the donor density, we have:\n$$\\omega_{p} = \\sqrt{\\frac{n e^2}{\\epsilon m^{\\ast}}}$$\nThis completes the derivation as requested.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are asked to compute the ratio $R \\equiv \\frac{f_p}{f_{\\mathrm{RF}}}$, where $f_p = \\omega_p / (2\\pi)$.\n\nFirst, we assemble the given constants and parameters in SI units.\n- Electron density $n$:\n  $n = 10^{18}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3} = 10^{18}\\ (\\frac{1}{10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m}})^{3} = 10^{18} \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3} = 10^{24}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$.\n- Permittivity $\\epsilon$:\n  $\\epsilon = 11.7\\,\\epsilon_{0} = 11.7 \\times (8.8541878128 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{F/m}) \\approx 1.03594 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{F/m}$.\n- Electron effective mass $m^{\\ast}$:\n  $m^{\\ast} = 0.26\\,m_{0} = 0.26 \\times (9.1093837015 \\times 10^{-31}\\ \\mathrm{kg}) \\approx 2.36844 \\times 10^{-31}\\ \\mathrm{kg}$.\n- Elementary charge $e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}$.\n- RF frequency $f_{\\mathrm{RF}} = 13.56\\ \\mathrm{MHz} = 1.356 \\times 10^7\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\nNow, we calculate $\\omega_p^2$:\n$$\n\\omega_p^2 = \\frac{n e^2}{\\epsilon m^{\\ast}} = \\frac{(10^{24}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3})(1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C})^2}{(11.7 \\times 8.8541878128 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{F/m})(0.26 \\times 9.1093837015 \\times 10^{-31}\\ \\mathrm{kg})}\n$$\n$$\n\\omega_p^2 \\approx \\frac{(10^{24})(2.56697 \\times 10^{-38})}{(1.03594 \\times 10^{-10})(2.36844 \\times 10^{-31})} \\approx \\frac{2.56697 \\times 10^{-14}}{2.45365 \\times 10^{-41}}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-2}\n$$\n$$\n\\omega_p^2 \\approx 1.04618 \\times 10^{27}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-2}\n$$\nThe angular plasma frequency $\\omega_p$ is the square root of this value:\n$$\n\\omega_p = \\sqrt{1.04618 \\times 10^{27}}\\ \\mathrm{rad/s} \\approx 3.23447 \\times 10^{13}\\ \\mathrm{rad/s}\n$$\nThe linear plasma frequency $f_p$ is:\n$$\nf_p = \\frac{\\omega_p}{2\\pi} \\approx \\frac{3.23447 \\times 10^{13}}{2\\pi}\\ \\mathrm{Hz} \\approx 5.1481 \\times 10^{12}\\ \\mathrm{Hz}\n$$\nThis corresponds to approximately $5.15$ terahertz.\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{f_p}{f_{\\mathrm{RF}}} = \\frac{5.1481 \\times 10^{12}\\ \\mathrm{Hz}}{13.56 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{Hz}} = \\frac{5.1481 \\times 10^{12}}{1.356 \\times 10^7}\n$$\n$$\nR \\approx 3.7965 \\times 10^5\n$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, as requested:\n$$\nR \\approx 3.80 \\times 10^5\n$$",

This length governs the spatial decay of a small electrostatic potential perturbation from its equilibrium value. The derivation starts from Poisson's equation, which relates the electrostatic potential $\\psi$ to the net charge density $\\rho$. In one dimension, this is:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_s}\n$$\nwhere $\\epsilon_s$ is the permittivity of silicon.

The charge density expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\rho(x) \\approx q(N_D - n(x))\n$$\nIn thermal equilibrium, the electron concentration $n$ is related to the local electrostatic potential $\\psi$ through Boltzmann statistics. Let us consider a small perturbation $\\delta\\psi(x)$ to the equilibrium potential $\\psi_0$. The total potential is $\\psi(x) = \\psi_0 + \\delta\\psi(x)$. The equilibrium state is charge neutral (quasi-neutrality), meaning the net charge density is zero. The problem states that the equilibrium electron concentration is $n_0 \\approx N_D$. This implies that at equilibrium, with a constant potential $\\psi_0$, the charge density is $\\rho_0 = q(N_D - n_0) = 0$.\n\nUnder a potential perturbation $\\delta\\psi(x)$, the electron concentration becomes:\n$$\nn(x) = n_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{q(\\psi(x) - \\psi_0)}{k_B T}\\right) = N_D \\exp\\left(-\\frac{q\\delta\\psi(x)}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for the charge density:\n$$\n\\rho(x) = q\\left(N_D - N_D \\exp\\left(-\\frac{q\\delta\\psi(x)}{k_B T}\\right)\\right) = qN_D\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{q\\delta\\psi(x)}{k_B T}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the characteristic length for *small perturbations*.

This approximation is valid when $|\\delta\\psi(x)| \\ll \\frac{k_B T}{q}$ (the thermal voltage).\n\nApplying the linearization:\n$$\n\\rho(x) \\approx qN_D\\left(1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{q\\delta\\psi(x)}{k_B T}\\right)\\right) = qN_D\\left(\\frac{q\\delta\\psi(x)}{k_B T}\\right) = \\frac{q^2 N_D}{k_B T} \\delta\\psi(x)\n$$\nNote the sign: $\\rho$ and $\\delta\\psi$ should have opposite signs to induce screening. Let's re-check the derivation. The electron energy is $-q\\psi$, so the concentration is proportional to $\\exp(-(-q\\psi)/k_BT) = \\exp(q\\psi/k_BT)$.\nLet the reference potential be zero where the electron concentration is $n_0$. Then $n(x) = n_0 \\exp(q\\psi/k_BT)$. In our case, the material is at equilibrium with potential $\\psi_0$ and concentration $n_0=N_D$. A perturbation $\\delta\\psi = \\psi-\\psi_0$ gives $n(x) = n_0 \\exp(q\\delta\\psi/k_BT)$.\nSo, $\\rho(x) = q(N_D - n_0\\exp(q\\delta\\psi/k_BT))$.\nLinearizing $\\exp(z) \\approx 1+z$:\n$\\rho(x) \\approx q(N_D - N_D(1+q\\delta\\psi/k_BT)) = - \\frac{q^2N_D}{k_BT}\\delta\\psi(x)$.\nThis is correct: a positive potential perturbation repels electrons, creating a local net positive charge. My previous derivation had a sign error in the Boltzmann factor exponent, which is now corrected.\n\nNow, we substitute this linearized charge density into Poisson's equation. Since $\\psi_0$ is constant, $\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} = \\frac{d^2\\delta\\psi}{dx^2}$.\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\delta\\psi}{dx^2} = -\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_s}\\left(-\\frac{q^2 N_D}{k_B T} \\delta\\psi(x)\\right) = \\frac{q^2 N_D}{\\epsilon_s k_B T} \\delta\\psi(x)\n$$\nRearranging gives the linearized Poisson equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\delta\\psi}{dx^2} - \\left(\\frac{q^2 N_D}{\\epsilon_s k_B T}\\right) \\delta\\psi(x) = 0\n$$\nThis is a standard homogeneous second-order linear ordinary differential equation. The general solution is of the form $\\delta\\psi(x) = A \\exp(-x/L_D) + B \\exp(x/L_D)$, where $L_D$ is the characteristic length scale defined by:\n$$\nL_D^2 = \\frac{\\epsilon_s k_B T}{q^2 N_D}\n$$\nThis characteristic screening length $L_D$ is the extrinsic Debye length for electrons.\n\nNext, we calculate the numerical value of $L_D$. The given parameters are:\n$N_{D} = 10^{17} \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\n$T = 300 \\ \\mathrm{K}$\n$\\epsilon_{r} = 11.7$\n$\\epsilon_{0} = 8.8541878128 \\times 10^{-12} \\ \\mathrm{F/m}$\n$q = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{C}$\n$k_{B} = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23} \\ \\mathrm{J/K}$\n\nFirst, we must ensure all units are consistent within the SI system. The donor density must be converted from $\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ to $\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$:\n$$\nN_D = 10^{17} \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3} = 10^{17} \\ \\frac{1}{(10^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{m})^3} = 10^{17} \\times 10^6 \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3} = 10^{23} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}\n$$\nThe permittivity of silicon is $\\epsilon_s = \\epsilon_r \\epsilon_0$:\n$$\n\\epsilon_s = 11.7 \\times (8.8541878128 \\times 10^{-12} \\ \\mathrm{F/m}) \\approx 1.03594 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\mathrm{F/m}\n$$\nThe thermal energy is:\n$$\nk_B T = (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23} \\ \\mathrm{J/K}) \\times (300 \\ \\mathrm{K}) = 4.141947 \\times 10^{-21} \\ \\mathrm{J}\n$$\nNow we can compute $L_D$:\n$$\nL_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon_s k_B T}{q^2 N_D}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(1.03594 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\mathrm{F/m}) \\times (4.141947 \\times 10^{-21} \\ \\mathrm{J})}{(1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{C})^2 \\times (10^{23} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3})}}\n$$\n$$\nL_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{4.28876 \\times 10^{-31} \\ \\mathrm{F \\cdot J / m}}{2.56697 \\times 10^{-38} \\ \\mathrm{C}^2 \\times 10^{23} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4.28876 \\times 10^{-31}}{2.56697 \\times 10^{-15}}} \\ \\mathrm{m}\n$$\n$$\nL_D = \\sqrt{1.67075 \\times 10^{-16}} \\ \\mathrm{m} \\approx 1.29257 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\mathrm{m}\n$$\nConverting to nanometers ($1 \\ \\mathrm{nm} = 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{m}$):\n$$\nL_D \\approx 12.9257 \\ \\mathrm{nm}\n$$\n\nFinally, we determine the maximum uniform spatial mesh spacing $\\Delta x_{\\max}$. The problem requires that the screening length $L_D$ be resolved with at least ten nodes. In computational physics, this is a rule of thumb for numerical accuracy, typically interpreted as requiring the mesh spacing $\\Delta x$ to be a fraction of the characteristic length, e.g., $\\Delta x \\leq L_D/10$. This ensures that there are 10 grid cells (and 11 nodes) spanning the characteristic length, which is sufficient to capture the exponential decay profile without excessive numerical error.\nTherefore, the condition is:\n$$\n\\Delta x \\le \\frac{L_D}{10}\n$$\nThe maximum allowed spacing is:\n$$\n\\Delta x_{\\max} = \\frac{L_D}{10} = \\frac{12.9257 \\ \\mathrm{nm}}{10} = 1.29257 \\ \\mathrm{nm}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the result to be expressed in nanometers, rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\n\\Delta x_{\\max} \\approx 1.29 \\ \\mathrm{nm}\n$$",
