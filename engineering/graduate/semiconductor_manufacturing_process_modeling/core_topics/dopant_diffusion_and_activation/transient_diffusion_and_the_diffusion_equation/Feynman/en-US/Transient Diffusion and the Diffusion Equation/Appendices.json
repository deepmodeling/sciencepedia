The dopant concentration is $C(x,t)$, the diffusion coefficient is a constant $D>0$, and the dopant transport obeys mass conservation and Fick’s first law. The wafer is initially undoped so that $C(x,0)=0$ for all $x>0$. The gas-phase ambient maintains a constant dopant chemical potential at the wafer surface, which equivalently imposes a time-independent Dirichlet boundary condition $C(0,t)=C_{s}$ for all $t>0$, with $C_{s}>0$ determined by the ambient. Far from the surface, the wafer remains undoped, so $C(x,t) \\to 0$ as $x \\to \\infty$ for all $t>0$.\n\nStarting from the mass conservation law and Fick’s first law (with constant $D$), derive the governing diffusion equation and solve for the concentration profile $C(x,t)$ that satisfies the specified initial and boundary conditions. From your solution, obtain the surface flux $J(0,t)$, defined as the limit of the diffusive flux at $x=0$. Then, define the integrated dose into the wafer as $M(t)=\\int_{0}^{\\infty} C(x,t) \\, dx$, and derive its time dependence.

From mass conservation integrated over $x \\in [0,\\infty)$,\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} \\, dx = D \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\partial^{2} C}{\\partial x^{2}} \\, dx = D \\left[ \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} \\right]_{x=0}^{x=\\infty} = - D \\, \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}\\biggr|_{x=0} = J(0,t).\n$$\nThus $M(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} J(0,\\tau) \\, d\\tau$. For a Dirichlet boundary with a constant nonzero surface concentration $C_{s}$ maintained for all time by an effectively infinite reservoir, we have $J(0,t) = C_{s} \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{\\pi t}}$, so\n$$\nM(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} C_{s} \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{\\pi \\tau}} \\, d\\tau = 2 C_{s} \\sqrt{\\frac{D t}{\\pi}} \\to \\infty \\quad \\text{as} \\quad t \\to \\infty.\n$$\nMore generally, if the boundary supply maintains $C(0,t)$ tending to a positive constant $C_{\\infty}>0$ as $t \\to \\infty$, then the long-time flux behaves like $J(0,t) \\sim C_{\\infty} \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{\\pi t}}$, and $M(t)$ grows like $\\sqrt{t}$, hence unbounded. Conversely, if the surface concentration $C(0,t)$ decays sufficiently rapidly so that $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} J(0,t) \\, dt$ converges—e.g., effective depletion at the boundary due to finite supply, flux-limited conditions, or a boundary concentration decaying faster than $t^{-1/2}$—then $M(t)$ remains bounded. Therefore, under a constant Dirichlet boundary with an infinite dopant reservoir and a semi-infinite substrate, the integrated dose grows without bound; bounded dose requires either a finite total supply (non-Dirichlet conditions), a decaying boundary concentration fast enough to make the time integral of $J(0,t)$ finite, or a finite substrate with sinks or alternative boundary conditions that arrest continued mass inflow.",

This provides a very direct relationship for the overshoot:\n$$\n\\mathcal{O}_1 = \\frac{C_1(0,t_1)}{N_B} = \\exp(z_1)\n$$\nTo find the value of $\\mathcal{O}_1$, we must first solve for $z_1$.\n\n**Option 2: Constant-Source Predeposition**\n\nThis process is characterized by a constant surface concentration $C_s$ maintained for all time $t>0$. The wafer is assumed to be initially free of the diffusing dopant. The mathematical formulation for the concentration $C_2(x,t)$ is:\n- PDE: $\\frac{\\partial C_2}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 C_2}{\\partial x^2}$ for $x > 0$, $t > 0$.\n- Initial Condition: $C_2(x,0) = 0$ for $x > 0$.\n- Boundary Conditions: $C_2(0,t) = C_s$ for $t > 0$, and $C_2(x,t) \\to 0$ as $x \\to \\infty$.\n\nThe solution to this boundary value problem is given in terms of the complementary error function, $\\operatorname{erfc}(u)$:\n$$\nC_2(x,t) = C_s \\operatorname{erfc}\\left(\\frac{x}{2\\sqrt{Dt}}\\right)\n$$\nThe junction is formed at time $t_2$ when $C_2(x_j, t_2) = N_B$:\n$$\nN_B = C_s \\operatorname{erfc}\\left(\\frac{x_j}{2\\sqrt{Dt_2}}\\right)\n$$\nThe surface concentration overshoot for this option, $\\mathcal{O}_2$, is evaluated at time $t_2$. By definition of the process, the surface concentration is always $C_s$. Thus, $C_2(0,t_2) = C_s$. The overshoot is therefore constant:\n$$\n\\mathcal{O}_2 = \\frac{C_2(0,t_2)}{N_B} = \\frac{C_s}{N_B}\n$$\n\n**Numerical Evaluation and Comparison**\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values to find $\\mathcal{O}_1$ and $\\mathcal{O}_2$.\nGiven parameters:\n- $Q = 5.0 \\times 10^{17} \\,\\mathrm{m^{-2}}$\n- $N_B = 1.0 \\times 10^{23} \\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$\n- $C_s = 3.0 \\times 10^{26} \\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$\n- $x_j = 2.0 \\times 10^{-7} \\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $D = 2.0 \\times 10^{-15} \\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}}$\n\nFirst, we calculate $\\mathcal{O}_2$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{O}_2 = \\frac{C_s}{N_B} = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{26} \\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}}{1.0 \\times 10^{23} \\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}} = 3000\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate $\\mathcal{O}_1$. We must solve for $z_1$ from the equation $\\sqrt{z_1} \\exp(-z_1) = \\frac{N_B x_j \\sqrt{\\pi}}{2Q}$.\nLet's compute the right-hand side constant:\n$$\n\\frac{N_B x_j \\sqrt{\\pi}}{2Q} = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{23} \\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}})(2.0 \\times 10^{-7} \\,\\mathrm{m})\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2(5.0 \\times 10^{17} \\,\\mathrm{m^{-2}})} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{16}}{1.0 \\times 10^{18}}\\sqrt{\\pi} = 0.02\\sqrt{\\pi}\n$$\nThe equation for $z_1$ is $\\sqrt{z_1} \\exp(-z_1) = 0.02\\sqrt{\\pi}$. Using $\\sqrt{\\pi} \\approx 1.77245$, the right side is approximately $0.035449$.\nWe need to solve $\\sqrt{z_1} \\exp(-z_1) \\approx 0.035449$. This is a transcendental equation. Let's square both sides and take the natural logarithm:\n$z_1 \\exp(-2z_1) = (0.02\\sqrt{\\pi})^2 = 0.0004\\pi \\approx 0.0012566$.\n$\\ln(z_1) - 2z_1 = \\ln(0.0004\\pi) \\approx -6.6793$.\nAn iterative or numerical solution is required. Let's test a value, for instance $z_1=4$.\n$\\ln(4) - 2(4) = 1.3863 - 8 = -6.6137$. This is close.\nLet's try a slightly larger value, $z_1=4.03$.\n$\\ln(4.03) - 2(4.03) = 1.3937 - 8.06 = -6.6663$. This is very close to the target value.\nWe can thus approximate $z_1 \\approx 4.03$.\nNow we can compute the overshoot for option 1:\n$$\n\\mathcal{O}_1 = \\exp(z_1) \\approx \\exp(4.03) \\approx 56.26\n$$\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the two overshoot values:\n- $\\mathcal{O}_1 \\approx 56.26$\n- $\\mathcal{O}_2 = 3000$\n\nWe see that $\\mathcal{O}_1 < \\mathcal{O}_2$. The limited-source drive-in (Option 1) achieves the target junction depth with a significantly smaller surface concentration overshoot.\nThe problem asks for an indicator $I$, where $I=1$ if the limited-source option yields the smaller overshoot and $I=0$ otherwise.\nSince the limited-source option has the smaller overshoot, the indicator is $I=1$.",
