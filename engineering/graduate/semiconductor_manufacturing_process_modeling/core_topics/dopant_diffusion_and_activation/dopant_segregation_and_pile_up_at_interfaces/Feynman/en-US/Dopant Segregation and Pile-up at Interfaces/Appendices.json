Calculate the Gibbs Free Energy of Segregation ($\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{seg}}$)**\n\nThe Gibbs free energy change for a process at constant temperature is given by the relation:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{seg}} = \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{seg}} - T \\Delta S_{\\mathrm{seg}} $$\nWe are given the following values:\n- Enthalpy of segregation, $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{seg}} = 0.12 \\, \\mathrm{eV}$\n- Entropy of segregation, $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{seg}} = 0.5 \\, k_{B}$\n- Temperature, $T = 1100 \\, \\mathrm{K}$\n- Boltzmann constant, $k_{B} = 8.617333262 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\mathrm{eV/K}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the term $T \\Delta S_{\\mathrm{seg}}$:\n$$ T \\Delta S_{\\mathrm{seg}} = (1100 \\, \\mathrm{K}) \\times (0.5 \\times 8.617333262 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\mathrm{eV/K}) = 0.0473953... \\, \\mathrm{eV} $$\nNow, we can find $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{seg}}$:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{seg}} = 0.12 \\, \\mathrm{eV} - 0.0473953... \\, \\mathrm{eV} = 0.0726046... \\, \\mathrm{eV} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{seg}} = 0.07260 \\, \\mathrm{eV}$.\n\n**2. Calculate the Segregation Coefficient ($k$)**\n\nThe segregation coefficient $k$ is defined as the ratio of site occupancies at equilibrium. This ratio is determined by the free energy change of transferring a dopant from a bulk site to an interface site, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{seg}}$. The relationship derived from statistical mechanics is:\n$$ k = \\frac{\\theta_{\\text{interface}}}{\\theta_{\\text{bulk}}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{seg}}}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nHere, the pre-exponential factor is 1 because the problem states the site degeneracies are the same.

An interface at $x=0$ moves into the semiconductor at a constant speed $v$ due to growth of a layer on the other side (e.g., oxidation or epitaxy). Arsenic diffuses in the semiconductor with a constant diffusion coefficient $D$, and segregates at the interface with an equilibrium segregation coefficient $k$, defined as the ratio of the interfacial equilibrium arsenic concentration on the non-semiconductor side to that on the semiconductor side.

Do not include any units in your final answer.",
            "solution": "This problem requires deriving the steady-state concentration profile for a dopant at a moving interface and then calculating a characteristic length from that profile.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Steady-State Concentration Profile**\n\nWe start with Fick's second law in the lab frame: $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2}$. To find a steady-state solution, we transform to a coordinate system $x' = x - vt$ that moves with the interface. In this frame, the diffusion equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t'} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial (x')^2} + v \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x'} $$\nFor a steady state in the moving frame, $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t'} = 0$. Using $x$ to represent the spatial coordinate $x'$ in this frame, we get the ordinary differential equation:\n$$ D \\frac{d^2 C}{d x^2} + v \\frac{dC}{dx} = 0 $$\nThe general solution to this ODE is $C(x) = A_1 + A_2 \\exp(-\\frac{vx}{D})$.\n\nWe apply two boundary conditions to find the constants $A_1$ and $A_2$.\n- **Far-field condition:** As $x \\to \\infty$, the concentration must be the bulk concentration, $C(\\infty) = C_{\\infty}$. This implies $A_1 = C_{\\infty}$.\n- **Interface flux balance:** At the interface ($x=0$), the flux of dopant atoms must be continuous. The flux of dopant arriving at the interface from the semiconductor bulk must equal the flux of dopant being incorporated into the growing layer. In the moving frame, this balance is expressed as:\n$$ -D \\frac{dC}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0} + vC(0) = vC_{\\text{layer}}(0) $$\nHere, $vC(0)$ is the convective flux of dopants arriving at the interface as the semiconductor is consumed, and $-D \\frac{dC}{dx}$ is the diffusive flux. The term on the right is the flux carried away into the new layer.\nUsing the segregation coefficient $k = C_{\\text{layer}}(0) / C(0)$, we have:\n$$ -D \\frac{dC}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0} = v(k-1)C(0) $$\nWe apply this condition to our solution $C(x) = C_{\\infty} + A_2 \\exp(-\\frac{vx}{D})$. The derivative is $\\frac{dC}{dx} = -A_2 \\frac{v}{D} \\exp(-\\frac{vx}{D})$.\nSubstituting into the flux balance equation at $x=0$:\n$$ -D \\left(-A_2 \\frac{v}{D}\\right) = v(k-1)(C_{\\infty} + A_2) $$\n$$ v A_2 = v(k-1)C_{\\infty} + v(k-1)A_2 $$\nSolving for $A_2$:\n$$ A_2(1 - (k-1)) = (k-1)C_{\\infty} \\implies A_2(2-k) = (k-1)C_{\\infty} $$\nThis seems inconsistent with the other problem's derivation. Let's reconsider the flux balance condition. A simpler method is to state that the total number of dopant atoms is conserved. The number of rejected atoms per unit time must diffuse away from the interface.\nFlux of rejected atoms = $v C(0) - v C_{\\text{layer}}(0) = v C(0) (1-k)$.\nThis must be balanced by the diffusive flux away from the interface, $J_{\\text{diff}} = -D \\frac{dC}{dx}\\big|_{x=0}$.\n$$ -D \\frac{dC}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0} = v C(0) (1-k) $$\nThis is the same boundary condition. Let's re-solve.\n$vA_2 = v(k-1)C_{\\infty} + v(k-1)A_2$\n$A_2 = (k-1)C_{\\infty} + (k-1)A_2$\n$A_2(1 - (k-1)) = (k-1)C_{\\infty}$\n$A_2(2-k) = (k-1)C_{\\infty}$\n$A_2 = \\frac{k-1}{2-k} C_{\\infty}$.\nThis gives $C(x) = C_{\\infty} \\left( 1 + \\frac{k-1}{2-k} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{vx}{D}\\right) \\right)$. Let's test this. For $k=0.3$, pile-up factor $C(0)/C_\\infty = 1 + (-0.7/1.7) \\approx 0.58$, which is depletion, not pileup. The derivation in the original meta-commentary was flawed.\n\nLet's use the correct flux balance from standard literature (e.g., Grove-Deal model):\nThe flux of dopant atoms toward the interface in the stationary frame is $J = -D \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}$. The interface moves at speed $v$. The total number of dopant atoms incorporated into the growing layer of thickness $dx_{\\text{ox}}$ is $C_{\\text{layer}} dx_{\\text{ox}}$. This must equal the dopant supplied from the bulk, which is the amount consumed $(C(0) \\cdot dx_{\\text{si}})$ minus the amount that diffuses away from the interface. The steady state flux balance at the interface is $vC(0) + D\\frac{dC}{dx}\\big|_{x=0} = vC_{\\text{layer}}(0) = vkC(0)$.\n$$ D\\frac{dC}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0} = v(k-1)C(0) $$\nLet's re-apply this to the solution $C(x) = C_{\\infty} + A_2 \\exp(-\\frac{vx}{D})$.\n$C(0) = C_{\\infty} + A_2$.\n$\\frac{dC}{dx}\\big|_{x=0} = -A_2 \\frac{v}{D}$.\nSubstituting:\n$$ D\\left(-A_2 \\frac{v}{D}\\right) = v(k-1)(C_{\\infty} + A_2) $$\n$$ -A_2 v = v(k-1)C_{\\infty} + v(k-1)A_2 $$\n$$ -A_2 = (k-1)C_{\\infty} + (k-1)A_2 $$\n$$ -A_2 - (k-1)A_2 = (k-1)C_{\\infty} $$\n$$ A_2(-1 - k + 1) = (k-1)C_{\\infty} $$\n$$ -k A_2 = (k-1)C_{\\infty} \\implies A_2 = \\frac{1-k}{k}C_{\\infty} $$\nThe concentration profile is therefore:\n$$ C(x) = C_{\\infty} \\left[ 1 + \\left(\\frac{1-k}{k}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{vx}{D}\\right) \\right] $$\nThis is the correct result.\n\n**2. Define and Calculate the Pile-up Width**\n\nThe problem defines the pile-up width, $L$, as the e-folding length of the interfacial enrichment zone. The enrichment term is the part of the solution that deviates from $C_{\\infty}$:\n$$ C_{\\text{enrichment}}(x) = C_{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{1-k}{k}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{vx}{D}\\right) $$\nThe exponential spatial decay is governed by $\\exp(-vx/D)$. The e-folding length is the distance $L$ where the argument of the exponential equals $-1$:\n$$ \\frac{vL}{D} = 1 \\implies L = \\frac{D}{v} $$\nThe pile-up width depends on the dopant diffusivity and the interface velocity, but notably not on the segregation coefficient $k$.\n\n**3. Compute the Ratio of Pile-up Widths**\n\nWe are asked for the ratio of the pile-up width in germanium ($L_{\\mathrm{Ge}}$) to that in silicon ($L_{\\mathrm{Si}}$) for arsenic.\n$$ L_{\\mathrm{Ge}} = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{Ge}}}{v} $$\n$$ L_{\\mathrm{Si}} = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{Si}}}{v} $$\nThe ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{Ge}}}{L_{\\mathrm{Si}}} = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{Ge}}/v}{D_{\\mathrm{Si}}/v} = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{Ge}}}{D_{\\mathrm{Si}}} $$\nUsing the given parameter values:\n$$ D_{\\mathrm{Ge}} = 5 \\times 10^{-16}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s} $$\n$$ D_{\\mathrm{Si}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-17}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s} $$\n$$ \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{Ge}}}{L_{\\mathrm{Si}}} = \\frac{5 \\times 10^{-16}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-17}} = 50 $$\nThe problem asks for the result to be rounded to four significant figures. Expressing 50 to four significant figures gives $50.00$.",

We apply the boundary conditions:\n- At $x=L$: $C(L) = ML + N = C_0 \\implies N = C_0 - ML$.\n- At $x=0$: $-D \\frac{dC}{dx}\\big|_{x=0} = h(C(0) - S C_0)$.\nSince $C(0) = N$ and $\\frac{dC}{dx} = M$, this becomes $-DM = h(N - SC_0)$.\nSubstitute $N$:\n$$ -DM = h((C_0 - ML) - SC_0) = hC_0(1-S) - hML $$\nSolving for $M$:\n$$ M(hL - D) = hC_0(1-S) \\implies M = \\frac{hC_0(1-S)}{hL - D} $$\nWe need the enrichment ratio $R_{\\text{pred}} = C(0)/C_0 = N/C_0$.\n$$ N = C_0 - L \\left( \\frac{hC_0(1-S)}{hL - D} \\right) = C_0 \\left( 1 - \\frac{hL(1-S)}{hL - D} \\right) = C_0 \\left( \\frac{hLS - D}{hL - D} \\right) $$\nThus, the predicted enrichment ratio is:\n$$ R_{\\text{pred}} = \\frac{N}{C_0} = \\frac{hLS - D}{hL - D} = \\frac{D - hLS}{D - hL} $$\n\n**Implementation**\nThe following Python code implements these formulas to run the test suite and produce the required boolean list.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of dopant segregation at a semiconductor interface\n    by deriving a continuum model and comparing it to KMC simulation data.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Absolute error threshold\n    tau = 0.3\n    \n    # Test suite: (a, L, k_b, k_cap, k_rel, R_kmc)\n    # a: lattice spacing (m)\n    # L: domain length (m)\n    # k_b: bulk hop rate (s^-1)\n    # k_cap: capture rate (s^-1)\n    # k_rel: release rate (s^-1)\n    # R_kmc: KMC-measured enrichment ratio\n    test_cases = [\n        (5e-10, 1e-7, 1e3, 1e4, 1e3, 9.7),\n        (5e-10, 1e-7, 1e3, 1e2, 1e2, 1.02),\n        (5e-10, 1e-7, 2e3, 1e2, 2e1, 5.8),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        a, L, k_b, k_cap, k_rel, R_kmc = case\n        \n        # Capture zone width is specified as delta = a/2\n        delta = a / 2.0\n        \n        # --- Step 1: Compute continuum model parameters from microscopic inputs ---\n        \n        # Diffusivity D from random walk parameters\n        # D = k_b * a^2\n        D = k_b * a**2\n        \n        # Segregation factor S from detailed balance of capture/release rates\n        # S = k_cap / k_rel\n        S = k_cap / k_rel\n        \n        # Interface transfer coefficient h from coarse-graining the capture process\n        # h = k_cap * delta = k_cap * a / 2\n        h = k_cap * delta\n        \n        # --- Step 2: Calculate the predicted enrichment ratio R_pred ---\n        \n        # The enrichment ratio R_pred = C(0)/C_0 is derived from solving the\n        # steady-state diffusion BVP.
