The use of the law of mass action is appropriate given the assumption of ideal solution thermodynamics. The given concentrations and temperature are within physically realistic ranges for semiconductor processing. The units of the equilibrium constant ($K$) are consistent with the reaction stoichiometry and the units of concentration: for the reaction $D + X \\rightleftharpoons DX$, $K$ is defined as $K = C_{DX} / (C_D C_X)$, which leads to units of $(\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}) / ((\\mathrm{cm}^{-3})(\\mathrm{cm}^{-3})) = \\mathrm{cm}^3$. The problem is self-contained, providing all necessary parameters for a unique solution. The question is objective and precisely formulated.

A detailed solution will be provided.\n\nLet $C_D$, $C_X$, and $C_{DX}$ denote the equilibrium concentrations of the free donor $D$, the free defect $X$, and the complex $DX$, respectively. The reaction is $D + X \\rightleftharpoons DX$.\n\nAccording to the law of mass action for an ideal solution, the equilibrium constant $K$ is related to the concentrations of the species by:\n$$K = \\frac{C_{DX}}{C_D C_X}$$\n\nThe total concentrations of the dopant and defect species are conserved. This provides two mass balance equations:\n$1.$ The total dopant concentration, $C_{D}^{\\text{tot}}$, is the sum of the free donor concentration and the concentration of donors in complexes:\n$$C_{D}^{\\text{tot}} = C_D + C_{DX}$$\n$2.$ The total defect concentration, which we denote by $C_{X}^{\\text{tot}}$ but is given as $C_{X}$ in the problem statement, is the sum of the free defect concentration and the concentration of defects in complexes:\n$$C_{X}^{\\text{tot}} = C_X + C_{DX}$$\nFor consistency with the problem statement, we will use $C_{X}^{\\text{tot}}$ for the total defect concentration, which has the value $8.00 \\times 10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.\n\nFrom the mass balance equations, we can express the concentrations of the free species, $C_D$ and $C_X$, in terms of the complex concentration $C_{DX}$:\n$$C_D = C_{D}^{\\text{tot}} - C_{DX}$$\n$$C_X = C_{X}^{\\text{tot}} - C_{DX}$$\nIt is important to note that all concentrations must be non-negative, which implies that $C_{DX} \\le C_{D}^{\\text{tot}}$ and $C_{DX} \\le C_{X}^{\\text{tot}}$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions for $C_D$ and $C_X$ into the equilibrium constant equation gives:\n$$K = \\frac{C_{DX}}{(C_{D}^{\\text{tot}} - C_{DX})(C_{X}^{\\text{tot}} - C_{DX})}$$\n\nThis equation can be rearranged into a quadratic equation for $C_{DX}$:\n$$K (C_{D}^{\\text{tot}} - C_{DX})(C_{X}^{\\text{tot}} - C_{DX}) = C_{DX}$$\n$$K (C_{D}^{\\text{tot}}C_{X}^{\\text{tot}} - C_{D}^{\\text{tot}}C_{DX} - C_{X}^{\\text{tot}}C_{DX} + C_{DX}^2) = C_{DX}$$\n$$K C_{DX}^2 - K(C_{D}^{\\text{tot}} + C_{X}^{\\text{tot}})C_{DX} + K C_{D}^{\\text{tot}}C_{X}^{\\text{tot}} = C_{DX}$$\n$$K C_{DX}^2 - \\left(1 + K(C_{D}^{\\text{tot}} + C_{X}^{\\text{tot}})\\right)C_{DX} + K C_{D}^{\\text{tot}}C_{X}^{\\text{tot}} = 0$$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation of the form $a x^2 + b x + c = 0$, with $x = C_{DX}$ and the coefficients:\n- $a = K$\n- $b = -\\left(1 + K(C_{D}^{\\text{tot}} + C_{X}^{\\text{tot}})\\right)$\n- $c = K C_{D}^{\\text{tot}}C_{X}^{\\text{tot}}$\n\nWe can now substitute the given numerical values:\n- $K = 5.00 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{3}$\n- $C_{D}^{\\text{tot}} = 3.00 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\n- $C_{X}^{\\text{tot}} = 8.00 \\times 10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\n\nLet's compute the terms required for the quadratic equation:\n$$K(C_{D}^{\\text{tot}} + C_{X}^{\\text{tot}}) = (5.00 \\times 10^{-19}) \\times (3.00 \\times 10^{19} + 8.00 \\times 10^{18})$$\n$$K(C_{D}^{\\text{tot}} + C_{X}^{\\text{tot}}) = (5.00 \\times 10^{-19}) \\times (3.80 \\times 10^{19}) = 19.0$$\n$$K C_{D}^{\\text{tot}}C_{X}^{\\text{tot}} = (5.00 \\times 10^{-19}) \\times (3.00 \\times 10^{19}) \\times (8.00 \\times 10^{18})$$\n$$K C_{D}^{\\text{tot}}C_{X}^{\\text{tot}} = (5.00 \\times 10^{-19}) \\times (2.40 \\times 10^{38}) = 1.20 \\times 10^{20}$$\n\nThe quadratic equation for $C_{DX}$ becomes:\n$$(5.00 \\times 10^{-19}) C_{DX}^2 - (1 + 19.0) C_{DX} + (1.20 \\times 10^{20}) = 0$$\n$$(5.00 \\times 10^{-19}) C_{DX}^2 - 20.0 C_{DX} + (1.20 \\times 10^{20}) = 0$$\n\nWe solve for $C_{DX}$ using the quadratic formula:\n$$C_{DX} = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$\n$$C_{DX} = \\frac{20.0 \\pm \\sqrt{(-20.0)^2 - 4(5.00 \\times 10^{-19})(1.20 \\times 10^{20})}}{2(5.00 \\times 10^{-19})}$$\n$$C_{DX} = \\frac{20.0 \\pm \\sqrt{400 - (20.0 \\times 10^{-19})(1.20 \\times 10^{20})}}{1.00 \\times 10^{-18}}$$\n$$C_{DX} = \\frac{20.0 \\pm \\sqrt{400 - 240}}{1.00 \\times 10^{-18}}$$\n$$C_{DX} = \\frac{20.0 \\pm \\sqrt{160}}{1.00 \\times 10^{-18}}$$\n$$C_{DX} = (20.0 \\pm 12.6491106...) \\times 10^{18}$$\n\nThis gives two possible mathematical solutions for $C_{DX}$:\n$$C_{DX,1} = (20.0 + 12.6491106...) \\times 10^{18} \\approx 3.2649 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$$\n$$C_{DX,2} = (20.0 - 12.6491106...) \\times 10^{18} \\approx 7.3509 \\times 10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$$\n\nWe must choose the physically meaningful solution.

We can rearrange it into the standard form $\\frac{dy}{dt} + P(t)y = Q(t)$.\n$$\n\\frac{d[DX]}{dt} = k_f [D]_{\\mathrm{tot}} [X] - k_f [X][DX] - k_r [DX]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d[DX]}{dt} + (k_f [X] + k_r)[DX] = k_f [D]_{\\mathrm{tot}} [X]\n$$\nThis ODE is of the form $\\frac{dy}{dt} + ay = b$, where $y(t) = [DX](t)$, $a = k_f [X] + k_r$, and $b = k_f [D]_{\\mathrm{tot}} [X]$. Since $k_f$, $k_r$, $[X]$, and $[D]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ are all constants, $a$ and $b$ are also constants.\n\nThe general solution to this type of ODE is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is $\\frac{dy_h}{dt} + ay_h = 0$, which has the solution $y_h(t) = C e^{-at}$. A particular solution for a constant forcing term $b$ is a constant $y_p = b/a$. Thus, the general solution is:\n$$\n[DX](t) = \\frac{b}{a} + C e^{-at} = \\frac{k_f [D]_{\\mathrm{tot}} [X]}{k_f [X] + k_r} + C e^{-(k_f [X] + k_r)t}\n$$\nThe constant $C$ is determined by the initial condition $[DX](0) = [DX]_0$:\n$$\n[DX]_0 = \\frac{k_f [D]_{\\mathrm{tot}} [X]}{k_f [X] + k_r} + C e^0\n$$\n$$\nC = [DX]_0 - \\frac{k_f [D]_{\\mathrm{tot}} [X]}{k_f [X] + k_r}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $C$ back into the general solution gives the final explicit expression for $[DX](t)$:\n$$\n[DX](t) = \\frac{k_f [D]_{\\mathrm{tot}} [X]}{k_f [X] + k_r} + \\left( [DX]_0 - \\frac{k_f [D]_{\\mathrm{tot}} [X]}{k_f [X] + k_r} \\right) e^{-(k_f [X] + k_r)t}\n$$\nThis solution can be interpreted by defining the equilibrium concentration of the complex, $[DX]_{\\mathrm{eq}}$, which is the value of $[DX](t)$ as $t \\to \\infty$. In this limit, the exponential term decays to zero:\n$$\n[DX]_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} [DX](t) = \\frac{k_f [D]_{\\mathrm{tot}} [X]}{k_f [X] + k_r}\n$$\nThe solution can then be written more compactly as:\n$$\n[DX](t) = [DX]_{\\mathrm{eq}} + ([DX]_0 - [DX]_{\\mathrm{eq}}) e^{-t/\\tau}\n$$\nwhere the characteristic time constant for the reaction is $\\tau = \\frac{1}{k_f [X] + k_r}$. This shows that the concentration of the complex $[DX](t)$ relaxes exponentially from its initial value $[DX]_0$ to its final equilibrium value $[DX]_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ with a time constant $\\tau$.\n\nThis single derived formula is general and covers all the special cases presented in the test suite by substituting the appropriate parameter values (e.g., $k_r = 0$, $k_f = 0$, $[X] = 0$).\n\nA special computational case arises if the denominator $k_f [X] + k_r$ is zero. This occurs only if $k_f[X]=0$ and $k_r=0$ (since all parameters are non-negative). In this scenario, the original rate equation becomes $\\frac{d[DX]}{dt} = 0$, which implies that $[DX](t)$ is constant and equal to its initial value, $[DX](t) = [DX]_0$. The implementation should account for this edge case to avoid division by zero.\n\n### Implementation Plan\nThe Python program will implement the derived analytical solution.\n1.  A function `calculate_dx_transient` will be created to calculate $[DX](t)$ based on the derived formula for a given set of parameters and a list of times.\n2.  The main `solve` function will define the six test cases from the problem statement.\n3.  For Test Case 2, where $[DX]_0$ is specified as the equilibrium value, the program will first calculate $[DX]_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ and use it as the initial condition.\n4.

Specifically, compute the fractions of arsenic atoms residing in the species $As$, $AsV$, $As_2V$, and $As_3V$ given the total arsenic concentration and tabulated binding free energies.\n\nThe fundamental base must be the following, all expressed in the ideal solution (site-fraction) framework appropriate for point defects in a crystalline solid:\n- The law of mass action derived from equality of chemical potentials for each elementary association step at equilibrium.\n- The definition of an equilibrium constant from a standard free energy change.\n- Conservation of the total number of arsenic atoms.\n\nConsider successive association reactions of substitutional arsenic with a silicon vacancy:\n- $As + V \\rightleftharpoons AsV$,\n- $As + AsV \\rightleftharpoons As_2V$,\n- $As + As_2V \\rightleftharpoons As_3V$.\n\nDefine $x_{As}$, $x_V$, $x_{AsV}$, $x_{As_2V}$, and $x_{As_3V}$ as the site fractions (number per site) of each species on the silicon lattice. Let $N$ be the silicon lattice site density. You must assume that the silicon lattice site density is a constant $N = 5\\times 10^{22}$ in units of $\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, and that all concentrations provided are in units of $\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. The temperature is fixed at $T = 1273$ in units of $\\mathrm{K}$. The Boltzmann constant is $k_B = 8.617333262145\\times 10^{-5}$ in units of $\\mathrm{eV/K}$. The binding free energies for the three association steps are given as $(\\Delta G_1, \\Delta G_2, \\Delta G_3)$ in units of $\\mathrm{eV}$. The equilibrium constants are defined via the standard free energy changes as $K_i = \\exp\\!\\left(-\\Delta G_i/(k_B T)\\right)$, which are dimensionless in the site-fraction framework.\n\nStarting only from:\n- The law of mass action applied to the association steps, expressed in terms of site fractions and dimensionless equilibrium constants:\n  $x_{AsV} = K_1\\, x_{As}\\, x_V$, $x_{As_2V} = K_2\\, x_{As}\\, x_{AsV}$, $x_{As_3V} = K_3\\, x_{As}\\, x_{As_2V}$.\n- Total arsenic conservation, expressed in terms of site fractions:\n  $x_{As,\\mathrm{tot}} = x_{As} + x_{AsV} + 2\\,x_{As_2V} + 3\\,x_{As_3V}$, where $x_{As,\\mathrm{tot}} = C_{As,\\mathrm{tot}}/N$, $C_{As,\\mathrm{tot}}$ is the total arsenic concentration and $N$ is the site density.\n\nDerive, implement, and solve the resulting nonlinear equation for $x_{As}$ and then compute the fractions of arsenic atoms in each species:\n- $f_{As} = x_{As}/x_{As,\\mathrm{tot}}$,\n- $f_{AsV} = x_{AsV}/x_{As,\\mathrm{tot}}$,\n- $f_{As_2V} = 2\\,x_{As_2V}/x_{As,\\mathrm{tot}}$,\n- $f_{As_3V} = 3\\,x_{As_3V}/x_{As,\\mathrm{tot}}$.\n\nAll fractions must be returned as decimals (not percentages).

            "solution": "The problem is to compute the equilibrium distribution of arsenic dopant atoms among various species ($As$, $AsV$, $As_2V$, $As_3V$) in crystalline silicon at a fixed temperature. The problem is formulated within the ideal solution framework for point defects, using site fractions and the law of mass action.\n\n### Problem Validation\nFirst, the problem statement is critically assessed for validity.\n\n**1. Extracted Givens:**\n-   Fundamental principles: Law of mass action, equilibrium constants from standard free energy changes, conservation of total arsenic.\n-   Reactions: $As + V \\rightleftharpoons AsV$, $As + AsV \\rightleftharpoons As_2V$, $As + As_2V \\rightleftharpoons As_3V$.\n-   Site fractions: $x_{As}$, $x_V$, $x_{AsV}$, $x_{As_2V}$, $x_{As_3V}$.\n-   Constants: Silicon lattice site density $N = 5\\times 10^{22} \\, \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, Temperature $T = 1273 \\, \\mathrm{K}$, Boltzmann constant $k_B = 8.617333262145\\times 10^{-5} \\, \\mathrm{eV/K}$.\n-   Inputs: Binding free energies $(\\Delta G_1, \\Delta G_2, \\Delta G_3)$ in eV, total arsenic concentration $C_{As,\\mathrm{tot}}$, and a vacancy-related concentration $C_V$.\n-   Key Equations:\n    -   $K_i = \\exp(-\\Delta G_i/(k_B T))$\n    -   $x_{AsV} = K_1\\, x_{As}\\, x_V$, $x_{As_2V} = K_2\\, x_{As}\\, x_{AsV}$, $x_{As_3V} = K_3\\, x_{As}\\, x_{As_2V}$\n    -   $x_{As,\\mathrm{tot}} = x_{As} + x_{AsV} + 2\\,x_{As_2V} + 3\\,x_{As_3V}$\n-   Outputs: Fractions of arsenic atoms $f_{As}$, $f_{AsV}$, $f_{As_2V}$, $f_{As_3V}$.\n\n**2. Validation Analysis:**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in standard solid-state physics and thermodynamics of point defects. The provided model and parameters are physically realistic. The core of the validation hinges on whether the problem is well-posed. The system involves five unknown site fractions ($x_{As}$, $x_{V}$, $x_{AsV}$, $x_{As_2V}$, $x_{As_3V}$). The problem explicitly provides three mass-action relations and one arsenic conservation law, for a total of four equations. This system is under-determined.\n\nHowever, the test cases provide values for a parameter $C_V$. The problem statement is critically ambiguous about the precise definition of $C_V$. It could represent the total vacancy concentration, $C_{V,\\mathrm{tot}}$, which would necessitate a fifth equation for vacancy conservation ($x_{V,\\mathrm{tot}} = x_V + x_{AsV} + x_{As_2V} + x_{As_3V}$). This would contradict the strict instruction to start *only* from the given laws.\n\nThe alternative, more consistent interpretation is that $C_V$ represents the concentration of free, un-complexed vacancies, $[V] \\cdot N$. This implies that the site fraction of free vacancies, $x_V = C_V/N$, is a fixed input parameter for each case. This is a common physical approximation where the concentration of one reactant is assumed to be constant, buffered by a large reservoir or an external equilibrium. This interpretation resolves the ambiguity, makes the problem solvable as stated (reducing it to a single nonlinear equation in $x_{As}$), and does not violate the \"Starting only from...\" constraint.\n\nUnder this interpretation, the problem is well-posed. The resulting polynomial equation for $x_{As}$ can be shown to have a unique, physically meaningful root in the specified solution interval $[0, x_{As,\\mathrm{tot}}]$.\n\n**3. Verdict:**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**, with the explicit clarification that the input parameter $C_V$ is interpreted as the concentration of free vacancies, thereby fixing the value of $x_V$.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe solution proceeds by deriving a single nonlinear equation for the site fraction of free substitutional arsenic, $x_{As}$, and then solving it numerically.\n\n**1. Expression of Equilibrium Constants and Site Fractions**\nThe site density is $N=5 \\times 10^{22} \\, \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ and temperature is $T=1273 \\, \\mathrm{K}$. The product of the Boltzmann constant $k_B$ and temperature $T$ is a useful energy scale:\n$$k_B T = (8.617333262145\\times 10^{-5} \\, \\mathrm{eV/K}) \\times (1273 \\, \\mathrm{K}) \\approx 0.10966 \\, \\mathrm{eV}$$\nThe dimensionless equilibrium constants $K_i$ are calculated as:\n$$K_i = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_i}{k_B T}\\right) \\quad \\text{for } i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$$\nSite fractions are defined by dividing concentrations by the site density $N$. The given inputs $C_{As,\\mathrm{tot}}$ and $C_V$ are converted to site fractions:\n$$x_{As,\\mathrm{tot}} = \\frac{C_{As,\\mathrm{tot}}}{N}$$\n$$x_V = \\frac{C_V}{N}$$\nAs established, $x_V$ is treated as a known constant for each test case.\n\n**2. Relating Complex Fractions to Free Arsenic Fraction**\nUsing the law of mass action relations, we express the site fractions of the complexes in terms of the unknown free arsenic site fraction, $x_{As}$, and the known free vacancy site fraction, $x_V$.\n$$x_{AsV} = K_1 x_{As} x_V$$\nBy successive substitution:\n$$x_{As_2V} = K_2 x_{As} x_{AsV} = K_2 x_{As} (K_1 x_{As} x_V) = K_1 K_2 x_{As}^2 x_V$$\n$$x_{As_3V} = K_3 x_{As} x_{As_2V} = K_3 x_{As} (K_1 K_2 x_{As}^2 x_V) = K_1 K_2 K_3 x_{As}^3 x_V$$\n\n**3. The Arsenic Conservation Equation**\nThe total amount of arsenic is conserved. The problem provides the conservation law, which sums the arsenic atoms present in each species:\n$$x_{As,\\mathrm{tot}} = x_{As} + x_{AsV} + 2x_{As_2V} + 3x_{As_3V}$$\nSubstituting the expressions from the previous step yields a single equation in terms of $x_{As}$:\n$$x_{As,\\mathrm{tot}} = x_{As} + (K_1 x_V) x_{As} + 2(K_1 K_2 x_V) x_{As}^2 + 3(K_1 K_2 K_3 x_V) x_{As}^3$$\nThis can be rearranged into a standard cubic polynomial form, $f(x_{As}) = 0$:\n$$3(K_1 K_2 K_3 x_V) x_{As}^3 + 2(K_1 K_2 x_V) x_{As}^2 + (1 + K_1 x_V) x_{As} - x_{As,\\mathrm{tot}} = 0$$\n\n**4. Numerical Solution and Final Calculation**\nThis cubic equation must be solved for $x_{As}$. Since all equilibrium constants $K_i$ and site fractions are non-negative, the coefficients of the polynomial terms in $x_{As}$ are non-negative. The function $f(x_{As})$ is therefore monotonically increasing for $x_{As} \\ge 0$. With $f(0) = -x_{As,\\mathrm{tot}} < 0$ and $f(x_{As,\\mathrm{tot}}) \\ge 0$, a unique root is guaranteed to exist in the physically meaningful interval $[0, x_{As,\\mathrm{tot}}]$.\n\nA robust root-finding algorithm, such as Brent's method, is suitable for solving for $x_{As}$. Once the solution $x_{As}^*$ is found, the equilibrium site fractions of the complexes are calculated using the expressions from step 2.\n\nFinally, the required fractions of arsenic atoms in each species are computed. These are the ratios of arsenic atoms in a given species to the total number of arsenic atoms:\n-   $f_{As} = \\frac{x_{As}^*}{x_{As,\\mathrm{tot}}}$\n-   $f_{AsV} = \\frac{x_{AsV}}{x_{As,\\mathrm{tot}}} = \\frac{K_1 x_{As}^* x_V}{x_{As,\\mathrm{tot}}}$\n-   $f_{As_2V} = \\frac{2x_{As_2V}}{x_{As,\\mathrm{tot}}} = \\frac{2K_1 K_2 (x_{As}^*)^2 x_V}{x_{As,\\mathrm{tot}}}$\n-   $f_{As_3V} = \\frac{3x_{As_3V}}{x_{As,\\mathrm{tot}}} = \\frac{3K_1 K_2 K_3 (x_{As}^*)^3 x_V}{x_{As,\\mathrm{tot}}}$\n\nBy the construction of the conservation equation, the sum of these fractions must equal $1$. The implementation will calculate these values for each test case, round them to $6$ decimal places, and format the output as specified.",
