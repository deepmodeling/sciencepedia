All necessary parameters and definitions are provided to compute the requested quantities. The physical models, while empirical, are standard representations used in Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) for semiconductor device simulation. The problem is therefore valid for solution.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of a dimensionless sensitivity metric, $S$, which compares the temperature dependence of one bandgap narrowing model to the magnitude of another. The metric is defined as:\n$$\nS \\equiv \\frac{\\Delta E_{g}^{(T)}(N_{D},\\,T=325\\,\\text{K}) - \\Delta E_{g}^{(T)}(N_{D},\\,T=300\\,\\text{K})}{\\Delta E_{g}^{(0)}(N_{D})}\n$$\n\nThe calculation will be performed in three steps, corresponding to parts (a), (b), and (c) of the problem statement.\n\nFirst, let us identify the common logarithmic term present in all bandgap narrowing expressions.

Since its value, $\\ln(51)$, is non-zero, it can be cancelled from the expression. This algebraic simplification is a critical step that ensures accuracy and reveals the underlying physical relationship.\nFactoring the numerator, we get:\n$$\nS = \\frac{\\left( k_B\\,(325\\,\\text{K}) - k_B\\,(300\\,\\text{K}) \\right) \\ln\\Bigl(1+\\frac{N_{D}}{N_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\Bigr)}{E_{0}\\,\\ln\\Bigl(1+\\frac{N_{D}}{N_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\Bigr)}\n$$\nAfter cancellation, the expression for $S$ simplifies significantly:\n$$\nS = \\frac{k_B\\,(325\\,\\text{K} - 300\\,\\text{K})}{E_{0}}\n$$\nThis shows that the sensitivity metric, as defined, is independent of the dopant concentration $N_D$, as long as $N_D > 0$.

Assume complete ionization of dopants, spatially uniform material parameters on each side, and that the junction is long enough for well-defined quasi-neutral regions far from the metallurgical junction.

The thermal voltage is defined as $V_T = \\frac{k_B T}{e}$.\n\nFirst, we establish the built-in potential for the ideal case without bandgap narrowing, denoted as $V_{bi}^{(0)}$. At thermal equilibrium, the Fermi level $E_F$ is constant across the junction. According to the problem statement, the built-in potential $V_{bi}^{(0)}$ is the electrostatic potential difference required to align the Fermi levels.\nIn the quasi-neutral p-type region, assuming complete ionization, the hole concentration is $p_p \\approx N_A$.

The problem instructs to treat this as a modification of the effective intrinsic carrier concentration.

The hole concentration is also given by $p = n_i \\exp(\\frac{E_i - E_F}{k_B T}) = n_i \\exp(\\frac{q\\phi_f}{k_B T})$.\nEquating $p$ with $N_A$ and solving for $\\phi_f$ yields:\n$$\n\\phi_f = \\frac{k_B T}{q} \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A}{n_i}\\right) = V_{th} \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A}{n_i}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $V_{th} = k_B T/q$ is the thermal voltage.\n\nBandgap narrowing affects the intrinsic carrier concentration, $n_i$. The square of $n_i$ is proportional to $\\exp(-E_g / (k_B T))$. A reduction in the bandgap by $\\Delta E_g$ changes the bandgap to $E_{g, \\text{BGN}} = E_{g,0} - \\Delta E_g$. The new effective intrinsic carrier concentration, $n_{i, \\text{eff}}$, is related to the baseline concentration $n_{i,0}$ as follows:\n$$\nn_{i, \\text{eff}}^2 = n_{i,0}^2 \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{g,0} - \\Delta E_g}{k_B T}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{g,0}}{k_B T}\\right)} = n_{i,0}^2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E_g}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nn_{i, \\text{eff}} = n_{i,0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E_g}{2k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nNow we can find the Fermi potentials for the two cases.\nWithout BGN:\n$$\n\\phi_{f,0} = V_{th} \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A}{n_{i,0}}\\right)\n$$\nWith BGN:\n$$\n\\phi_{f, \\text{BGN}} = V_{th} \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A}{n_{i, \\text{eff}}}\\right) = V_{th} \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A}{n_{i,0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E_g}{2k_B T}\\right)}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\phi_{f, \\text{BGN}} = V_{th} \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A}{n_{i,0}}\\right) - V_{th} \\left(\\frac{\\Delta E_g}{2k_B T}\\right) = \\phi_{f,0} - \\frac{\\Delta E_g}{2q}\n$$\nThe change in the Fermi potential is $\\phi_{f, \\text{BGN}} - \\phi_{f,0} = -\\frac{\\Delta E_g}{2q}$.\n\nWe will now perform the numerical calculations using SI units.\nGiven values:\n$N_A = 5 \\times 10^{18}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3} = 5 \\times 10^{24}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$\n$n_{i,0} = 1.0 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3} = 1.0 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$\n$\\Delta E_g = 80\\,\\text{meV} = 0.080\\,\\text{eV}$\n$T = 300\\,\\text{K}$\n$t_{\\text{ox}} = 2.0\\,\\text{nm} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m}$\n$\\varepsilon_{\\text{ox,r}} = 3.9$\n$\\varepsilon_{\\text{Si,r}} = 11.7$\nConstants:\n$q = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{C}$\n$\\varepsilon_{0} = 8.854187817 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{F}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$\n$k_B = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, calculate the thermal voltage $V_{th}$:\n$$\nV_{th} = \\frac{k_B T}{q} = \\frac{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{K}^{-1})(300\\,\\text{K})}{1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{C}} \\approx 0.025852\\,\\text{V}\n$$\nNext, calculate the Fermi potential without BGN, $\\phi_{f,0}$:\n$$\n\\phi_{f,0} = (0.025852\\,\\text{V}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{5 \\times 10^{24}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}}{1.0 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}}\\right) = (0.025852\\,\\text{V}) \\ln(5 \\times 10^8) \\approx 0.51781\\,\\text{V}\n$$\nCalculate the Fermi potential with BGN, $\\phi_{f, \\text{BGN}}$:\n$$\n\\phi_{f, \\text{BGN}} = \\phi_{f,0} - \\frac{\\Delta E_g}{2q} = 0.51781\\,\\text{V} - \\frac{0.080\\,\\text{eV}}{2e} = 0.51781\\,\\text{V} - 0.040\\,\\text{V} = 0.47781\\,\\text{V}\n$$\nThe first term of the shift $\\Delta V_T$ is:\n$$\n2(\\phi_{f, \\text{BGN}} - \\phi_{f,0}) = 2(-0.040\\,\\text{V}) = -0.080\\,\\text{V}\n$$\nNext, calculate the oxide capacitance $C_{ox}$ and silicon permittivity $\\varepsilon_{Si}$:\n$$\nC_{ox} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\text{ox,r}}\\varepsilon_0}{t_{\\text{ox}}} = \\frac{3.9 \\times (8.854 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{F}\\,\\text{m}^{-1})}{2.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m}} \\approx 0.017266\\,\\text{F}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{Si} = \\varepsilon_{\\text{Si,r}}\\varepsilon_0 = 11.7 \\times (8.854 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{F}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}) \\approx 1.0360 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\text{F}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\n$$\nNow, calculate the body effect term for both cases.
