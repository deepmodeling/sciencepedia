A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to find the instantaneous fraction of total precursor consumption that occurs on the reactor walls. Let this fraction be denoted by $F_{\\text{walls}}$.\n\nThe problem defines the molar consumption flux on a surface $i$ (in units of $\\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$) as a first-order process:\n$$J_{i} = k_{i} c_{g}$$\nwhere $k_{i}$ is the first-order surface reaction coefficient (in units of $\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$) and $c_{g}$ is the uniform gas-phase molar concentration of the precursor (in units of $\\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$).\n\nThe total molar consumption rate on a given surface $i$ (in units of $\\text{mol}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$) is the product of the molar flux and the total accessible surface area, $A_{i}$.\nFor the reactor walls, the total molar consumption rate, $R_{\\text{walls}}$, is:\n$$R_{\\text{walls}} = J_{\\text{walls}} A_{\\text{walls}} = k_{\\text{walls}} c_{g} A_{\\text{walls}}$$\nFor the wafers, the total molar consumption rate, $R_{\\text{wafers}}$, is:\n$$R_{\\text{wafers}} = J_{\\text{wafers}} A_{\\text{wafers}} = k_{\\text{wafers}} c_{g} A_{\\text{wafers}}$$\n\nThe problem states that gas-phase homogeneous reactions are negligible. Therefore, the total rate of precursor consumption in the reactor, $R_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the rates on all available surfaces:\n$$R_{\\text{total}} = R_{\\text{walls}} + R_{\\text{wafers}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the individual rates:\n$$R_{\\text{total}} = k_{\\text{walls}} c_{g} A_{\\text{walls}} + k_{\\text{wafers}} c_{g} A_{\\text{wafers}}$$\nFactoring out the common term $c_{g}$:\n$$R_{\\text{total}} = (k_{\\text{walls}} A_{\\text{walls}} + k_{\\text{wafers}} A_{\\text{wafers}}) c_{g}$$\n\nThis total rate, $R_{\\text{total}}$, is the rate of generation term that would appear in the overall molar balance for the precursor in the reactor volume $V$, i.e., $V \\frac{dc_{g}}{dt} = -R_{\\text{total}}$. However, to find the fraction of consumption, it is not necessary to solve this differential equation.\n\nThe instantaneous fraction of total precursor consumption attributed to the reactor walls, $F_{\\text{walls}}$, is the ratio of the consumption rate on the walls to the total consumption rate:\n$$F_{\\text{walls}} = \\frac{R_{\\text{walls}}}{R_{\\text{total}}}$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for $R_{\\text{walls}}$ and $R_{\\text{total}}$:\n$$F_{\\text{walls}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{walls}} c_{g} A_{\\text{walls}}}{(k_{\\text{walls}} A_{\\text{walls}} + k_{\\text{wafers}} A_{\\text{wafers}}) c_{g}}$$\nThe gas-phase concentration $c_{g}$ cancels from the numerator and denominator. This indicates that the fraction is independent of time and concentration, a direct consequence of both reaction pathways being first order in the same species. The final symbolic expression is:\n$$F_{\\text{walls}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{walls}} A_{\\text{walls}}}{k_{\\text{walls}} A_{\\text{walls}} + k_{\\text{wafers}} A_{\\text{wafers}}}$$\n\nNow, we evaluate this fraction numerically using the provided parameters:\n- $A_{\\text{walls}} = 6.8 \\ \\text{m}^{2}$\n- $A_{\\text{wafers}} = 2.4 \\ \\text{m}^{2}$\n- $k_{\\text{walls}} = 2.2 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n- $k_{\\text{wafers}} = 1.4 \\times 10^{-2} \\ \\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, calculate the product terms, which represent the effective reaction conductances (in $\\text{m}^{3}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$):\nThe term for the walls is:\n$$k_{\\text{walls}} A_{\\text{walls}} = (2.2 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}) \\times (6.8 \\ \\text{m}^{2}) = 0.01496 \\ \\text{m}^{3}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$$\nThe term for the wafers is:\n$$k_{\\text{wafers}} A_{\\text{wafers}} = (1.4 \\times 10^{-2} \\ \\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}) \\times (2.4 \\ \\text{m}^{2}) = 0.0336 \\ \\text{m}^{3}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$$\n\nSubstitute these values back into the expression for $F_{\\text{walls}}$:\n$$F_{\\text{walls}} = \\frac{0.01496 \\ \\text{m}^{3}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}}{0.01496 \\ \\text{m}^{3}\\,\\text{s}^{-1} + 0.0336 \\ \\text{m}^{3}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}}$$\n$$F_{\\text{walls}} = \\frac{0.01496}{0.04856}$$\nThe fraction is dimensionless, as expected.

            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in established principles of chemical engineering and reaction kinetics, is well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient data, and is expressed in objective, formal language. All provided equations and parameters are consistent and physically realistic for a low-pressure chemical vapor deposition process.\n\n### 1. Derivation of the Film Growth Rate ($G$)\n\nThe model describes a steady-state process where the diffusive flux of reactant from the bulk gas to the wafer surface is equal to the rate of consumption by the surface reaction.\n\nThe molar flux due to diffusion, $J$, across the boundary layer is given by:\n$$\nJ = k_g (C_b - C_s)\n$$\nwhere $k_g = D/\\delta$ is the mass transfer coefficient, $C_b$ is the bulk molar concentration of the reactant, and $C_s$ is its molar concentration at the surface.\n\nThe molar flux consumed by the first-order surface reaction is:\n$$\nJ = k_s C_s\n$$\nwhere $k_s = A \\exp(-E_a/(RT))$ is the surface reaction rate constant.\n\nAt steady state, these fluxes must be equal:\n$$\nk_g (C_b - C_s) = k_s C_s\n$$\n\nWe solve for the unknown surface concentration, $C_s$:\n$$\nk_g C_b - k_g C_s = k_s C_s\n$$\n$$\nk_g C_b = (k_s + k_g) C_s\n$$\n$$\nC_s = \\frac{k_g}{k_s + k_g} C_b\n$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $C_s$ back into the reaction rate equation, $J = k_s C_s$, gives the overall flux:\n$$\nJ = k_s \\left( \\frac{k_g}{k_s + k_g} C_b \\right) = \\frac{k_s k_g}{k_s + k_g} C_b\n$$\nThis expression shows that the overall process can be modeled as two resistances in series: the resistance to mass transfer ($1/k_g$) and the resistance to reaction ($1/k_s$).\n\nThe bulk concentration, $C_b$, is determined from the ideal gas law:\n$$\nC_b = \\frac{y_A P}{R T}\n$$\n\nFinally, the film thickness growth rate, $G$, is obtained by converting the molar flux $J$ to a deposition velocity using the molar mass, $M_s$, and density, $\\rho_s$, of the solid film:\n$$\nG = J \\frac{M_s}{\\rho_s}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $J$ and $C_b$ yields the final closed-form expression for the growth rate $G$:\n$$\nG(A,E_a,D,\\delta,P,T,y_A,M_s,\\rho_s) = \\frac{M_s y_A P}{\\rho_s R T} \\left( \\frac{k_s k_g}{k_s + k_g} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $k_s = A \\exp(-E_a/(RT))$ and $k_g = D/\\delta$.\n\n### 2. Derivation of Analytical Sensitivities ($S_i$)\n\nThe local sensitivity of the growth rate $G$ with respect to a parameter $p_i$ is its partial derivative, $S_i = \\partial G / \\partial p_i$. These are derived using standard calculus rules (product, quotient, and chain rules) applied to the expression for $G$. For clarity and computational efficiency, the sensitivities are expressed in terms of $G$, $k_s$, and $k_g$.\n\n-   Sensitivity to $A$:\n    $$S_A = \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial A} = \\frac{G}{A} \\left( \\frac{k_g}{k_s+k_g} \\right)$$\n-   Sensitivity to $E_a$:\n    $$S_{E_a} = \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial E_a} = - \\frac{G}{RT} \\left( \\frac{k_g}{k_s+k_g} \\right)$$\n-   Sensitivity to $D$:\n    $$S_D = \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial D} = \\frac{G}{D} \\left( \\frac{k_s}{k_s+k_g} \\right)$$\n-   Sensitivity to $\\delta$:\n    $$S_\\delta = \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial \\delta} = - \\frac{G}{\\delta} \\left( \\frac{k_s}{k_s+k_g} \\right)$$\n-   Sensitivity to $P$:\n    $$S_P = \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial P} = \\frac{G}{P}$$\n-   Sensitivity to $y_A$:\n    $$S_{y_A} = \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial y_A} = \\frac{G}{y_A}$$\n-   Sensitivity to $M_s$:\n    $$S_{M_s} = \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial M_s} = \\frac{G}{M_s}$$\n-   Sensitivity to $\\rho_s$:\n    $$S_{\\rho_s} = \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial \\rho_s} = - \\frac{G}{\\rho_s}$$\n-   Sensitivity to $T$: This is the most complex, as $T$ affects both $C_b$ and $k_s$.\n    $$S_T = \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial T} = G \\left( \\frac{E_a}{RT^2} \\frac{k_g}{k_s+k_g} - \\frac{1}{T} \\right)$$\n\n### 3. Uncertainty Propagation\n\nAssuming the input parameters $p_i$ are independent random variables with small uncertainties (standard deviations $\\sigma_{p_i}$), the variance of the growth rate, $\\sigma_G^2$, can be approximated using a first-order Taylor expansion (the uncertainty propagation formula):\n$$\n\\sigma_G^2 \\approx \\sum_i \\left( \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial p_i} \\right)^2 \\sigma_{p_i}^2 = \\sum_i S_i^2 \\sigma_{p_i}^2\n$$\nThe total variance is the sum of the variances contributed by each parameter:\n$$\n\\sigma_G^2 \\approx S_A^2 \\sigma_A^2 + S_{E_a}^2 \\sigma_{E_a}^2 + S_D^2 \\sigma_D^2 + S_\\delta^2 \\sigma_\\delta^2 + S_P^2 \\sigma_P^2 + S_T^2 \\sigma_T^2 + S_{y_A}^2 \\sigma_{y_A}^2 + S_{M_s}^2 \\sigma_{M_s}^2 + S_{\\rho_s}^2 \\sigma_{\\rho_s}^2\n$$\nThe predicted standard deviation of the growth rate is then $\\sigma_G = \\sqrt{\\sigma_G^2}$.\n\n### 4. Computational Implementation\n\nThe following algorithm is implemented to solve the problem for each test case:\n1.  Define the universal gas constant $R = 8.314462618~\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.\n2.  For a given set of nominal parameter values {$p_i$}, calculate the intermediate quantities $k_s$, $k_g$, and the nominal growth rate $G$.\n3.  Using the nominal values of $G$, $k_s$, $k_g$, and the parameters, calculate the nine analytical sensitivities $S_i = \\partial G / \\partial p_i$ using the derived formulas.\n4.  For the given uncertainties {$\\sigma_{p_i}$}, calculate the absolute standard deviation for each parameter. Note that for parameters with relative uncertainties (e.g., $\\sigma_A = 0.1A$), the absolute value is computed from the nominal value (e.g., $\\sigma_A = 0.1 \\times 2.0 \\times 10^2$).\n5.  Compute the total variance $\\sigma_G^2$ by summing the squared products of each sensitivity and its corresponding parameter standard deviation, i.e., $\\sum_i (S_i \\sigma_{p_i})^2$.\n6.  Calculate the final standard deviation as $\\sigma_G = \\sqrt{\\sigma_G^2}$.\n7.  The computed values for $G$ and $\\sigma_G$ for all three test cases are collected and formatted into the required output string.",
