            "problem": "A Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) process deposits a film on a heated substrate at temperature $T$ under low-coverage conditions such that adsorbed species $A^{*}$ do not interact with neighboring adsorbates and readsorption is negligible. Consider first-order desorption of $A^{*}$ into the gas phase from a single adsorption site type. Starting from statistical mechanics and the Transition State Theory (TST) picture of barrier crossing, derive the desorption rate constant as the probability per unit time that $A^{*}$ acquires sufficient energy to surmount a desorption barrier, and use it to estimate the residence time (mean lifetime) of $A^{*}$ on the surface.\n\nGiven $E_{\\mathrm{des}} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, $\\nu = 10^{13}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, and $T = 900\\,\\mathrm{K}$, compute the desorption rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{des}}$ and the residence time $\\tau$ of $A^{*}$. Round both $k_{\\mathrm{des}}$ and $\\tau$ to three significant figures. Express $k_{\\mathrm{des}}$ in $\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ and $\\tau$ in $\\mathrm{s}$.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of statistical mechanics and chemical kinetics, specifically Transition State Theory (TST) as applied to surface phenomena. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters for a unique and meaningful solution. The given values for desorption energy, attempt frequency, and temperature are physically realistic for a Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) process.\n\nThe process under consideration is the first-order desorption of an adsorbed species $A^{*}$ from a surface:\n$$A^{*} \\xrightarrow{k_{\\mathrm{des}}} A(g) + \\text{site}$$\nThe rate of this process is proportional to the surface coverage of $A^{*}$, denoted as $\\theta_{A}$, which is the fraction of available sites occupied by $A^{*}$. For a first-order reaction, the rate law is given by:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{des}} = -\\frac{d\\theta_{A}}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{des}} \\theta_{A}$$\nwhere $k_{\\mathrm{des}}$ is the first-order desorption rate constant. Our first task is to derive an expression for $k_{\\mathrm{des}}$.\n\nAccording to Transition State Theory (TST), the rate constant for a reaction is given by:\n$$k = \\kappa \\frac{k_B T}{h} \\frac{Q^{\\ddagger}}{Q_{R}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_0}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nHere, $\\kappa$ is the transmission coefficient (usually assumed to be $1$), $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $h$ is the Planck constant, $Q^{\\ddagger}$ and $Q_{R}$ are the total partition functions of the transition state and the reactant(s) respectively, and $E_0$ is the activation energy at absolute zero (the difference in zero-point energies between the transition state and reactants).\n\nFor the desorption of $A^{*}$, the reactant is the adsorbed species $A^{*}$ and the transition state is the species $A^{\\ddagger}$ at the top of the desorption energy barrier. The activation energy $E_0$ is the desorption barrier height, given as $E_{\\mathrm{des}}$. The TST expression for the desorption rate constant is:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{des}} = \\frac{k_B T}{h} \\frac{q^{\\ddagger}}{q_{A^{*}}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{des}}}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $q^{\\ddagger}$ and $q_{A^{*}}$ are the partition functions per species for the transition state and the adsorbed state, respectively, excluding the zero-point energy contribution which is accounted for in the exponential term. The transition state $A^{\\ddagger}$ is defined as an adsorbate with one of its vibrational degrees of freedom (the one corresponding to motion along the reaction coordinate, i.e., normal to the surface) converted into a translational motion over the barrier top.\n\nThe problem simplifies this by providing a pre-exponential factor, or \"attempt frequency,\" $\\nu$. This factor lumps the complex ratio of partition functions and the thermal energy term:\n$$\\nu = \\frac{k_B T}{h} \\frac{q^{\\ddagger}}{q_{A^{*}}}$$\nIn many cases, the partition functions of the remaining degrees of freedom for the reactant and transition state are similar ($q^{\\ddagger} \\approx q_{A^{*}}$), making $\\nu \\approx \\frac{k_B T}{h}$, which is a universal frequency on the order of $10^{13}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ at typical process temperatures. The problem provides $\\nu=10^{13}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, which is consistent with this picture.\n\nUsing this simplification, the rate constant takes the well-known Arrhenius-like form, also known as the Polanyi-Wigner equation for first-order desorption:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{des}} = \\nu \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{des}}}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThis expression has a clear physical interpretation as requested. From statistical mechanics, the probability $P(E)$ of a system in thermal equilibrium having an energy $E$ is proportional to the Boltzmann factor, $\\exp(-E/k_B T)$. Thus, the term $\\exp(-E_{\\mathrm{des}}/k_B T)$ represents the fraction of adsorbed species $A^{*}$ that possess at least the minimum energy $E_{\\mathrm{des}}$ required to overcome the desorption barrier. The pre-exponential factor $\\nu$ is the characteristic frequency at which the adsorbed species vibrates against the surface bond, effectively \"attempting\" to escape. The product of the attempt frequency and the probability of success per attempt gives the overall rate of successful escapes per unit time, which is the desorption rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{des}}$.\n\nNext, we relate the rate constant to the residence time $\\tau$. The residence time is the average lifetime of an adsorbed species on the surface. For a first-order decay process described by $-\\frac{d\\theta_{A}}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{des}} \\theta_{A}$, the solution is an exponential decay:\n$$\\theta_{A}(t) = \\theta_{A}(0) \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{des}} t)$$\nThe mean lifetime $\\tau$ of the species is the time constant of this exponential decay. It is defined as the integral of time weighted by the probability distribution of lifetimes, which for a first-order process simplifies to the reciprocal of the rate constant:\n$$\\tau = \\frac{\\int_0^\\infty t \\left(-\\frac{d\\theta_A}{dt}\\right) dt}{\\int_0^\\infty \\left(-\\frac{d\\theta_A}{dt}\\right) dt} = \\frac{\\int_0^\\infty t k_{\\mathrm{des}} \\theta_A(0) e^{-k_{\\mathrm{des}}t} dt}{\\theta_A(0)} = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{des}}}$$\nThus, the residence time is simply the inverse of the desorption rate constant.\n\nNow, we perform the numerical calculation using the given values:\n$E_{\\mathrm{des}} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n$\\nu = 10^{13}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n$T = 900\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n\nWe use the value of the Boltzmann constant in units of $\\mathrm{eV/K}$:\n$k_B \\approx 8.617333 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV \\cdot K^{-1}}$\n\nFirst, calculate the thermal energy $k_B T$:\n$$k_B T = (8.617333 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV \\cdot K^{-1}}) \\times (900\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 0.077556\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\n\nNext, calculate the argument of the exponential:\n$$\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{des}}}{k_B T} = \\frac{1.2\\,\\mathrm{eV}}{0.077556\\,\\mathrm{eV}} \\approx 15.4723$$\n\nNow, we can compute the desorption rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{des}}$:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{des}} = \\nu \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{des}}}{k_B T}\\right) = (10^{13}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}) \\times \\exp(-15.4723)$$\n$$k_{\\mathrm{des}} \\approx (10^{13}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}) \\times (1.9126 \\times 10^{-7}) \\approx 1.9126 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{des}} \\approx 1.91 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the residence time $\\tau$:\n$$\\tau = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{des}}} = \\frac{1}{1.9126 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}} \\approx 5.2285 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$\\tau \\approx 5.23 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\n\nThe computed values are $k_{\\mathrm{des}} \\approx 1.91 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ and $\\tau \\approx 5.23 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{s}$.",

Substituting this into the solution:\n$$0.95\\,\\theta_{\\mathrm{ss},2} = \\theta_{\\mathrm{ss},2} + (\\theta_{\\mathrm{ss},1} - \\theta_{\\mathrm{ss},2})\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{95}}{\\tau_2}\\right)$$\n$$-0.05\\,\\theta_{\\mathrm{ss},2} = (\\theta_{\\mathrm{ss},1} - \\theta_{\\mathrm{ss},2})\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{95}}{\\tau_2}\\right)$$\n$$\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{95}}{\\tau_2}\\right) = \\frac{-0.05\\,\\theta_{\\mathrm{ss},2}}{\\theta_{\\mathrm{ss},1} - \\theta_{\\mathrm{ss},2}} = \\frac{0.05\\,\\theta_{\\mathrm{ss},2}}{\\theta_{\\mathrm{ss},2} - \\theta_{\\mathrm{ss},1}}$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$-\\frac{t_{95}}{\\tau_2} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.05\\,\\theta_{\\mathrm{ss},2}}{\\theta_{\\mathrm{ss},2} - \\theta_{\\mathrm{ss},1}}\\right)$$\n$$t_{95} = -\\tau_2 \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.05\\,\\theta_{\\mathrm{ss},2}}{\\theta_{\\mathrm{ss},2} - \\theta_{\\mathrm{ss},1}}\\right) = \\tau_2 \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\theta_{\\mathrm{ss},2} - \\theta_{\\mathrm{ss},1}}{0.05\\,\\theta_{\\mathrm{ss},2}}\\right) = \\tau_2 \\ln\\left(20\\left(1 - \\frac{\\theta_{\\mathrm{ss},1}}{\\theta_{\\mathrm{ss},2}}\\right)\\right)$$\n\nNow, we must compute the numerical values.\nFirst, convert all units to SI.\n$M = 32.117\\,\\mathrm{g/mol} = 0.032117\\,\\mathrm{kg/mol}$.\n$P_1 = 40\\,\\mathrm{mTorr} = 40 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Torr} \\times 133.322\\,\\mathrm{Pa/Torr} = 5.33288\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.\n$P_2 = 160\\,\\mathrm{mTorr} = 4 \\times P_1 = 21.33152\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.\n\nCalculate the mass of a single silane molecule, $m$:\n$$m = \\frac{M}{N_A} = \\frac{0.032117\\,\\mathrm{kg/mol}}{6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}} \\approx 5.33315 \\times 10^{-26}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$$\nCalculate the denominator of the Hertz-Knudsen expression:\n$$\\sqrt{2\\pi m k_B T} = \\sqrt{2\\pi (5.33315 \\times 10^{-26}\\,\\mathrm{kg}) (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K}) (850\\,\\mathrm{K})} \\approx 6.26801 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J \\cdot s \\cdot m^{-1}}$$\nCalculate the impingement rates per unit area, $J_{\\mathrm{area}}$:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{area},1} = \\frac{P_1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi m k_B T}} = \\frac{5.33288\\,\\mathrm{Pa}}{6.26801 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J \\cdot s \\cdot m^{-1}}} \\approx 8.50808 \\times 10^{22}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-2}s^{-1}}$$\n$$J_{\\mathrm{area},2} = \\frac{P_2}{\\sqrt{2\\pi m k_B T}} = \\frac{21.33152\\,\\mathrm{Pa}}{6.26801 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J \\cdot s \\cdot m^{-1}}} \\approx 3.40323 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-2}s^{-1}}$$\nCalculate the impingement rates per site, $J_{\\mathrm{site}}$:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{site},1} = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{area},1}}{\\Gamma_s} = \\frac{8.50808 \\times 10^{22}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-2}s^{-1}}}{7.0 \\times 10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}} \\approx 12154.4\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\n$$J_{\\mathrm{site},2} = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{area},2}}{\\Gamma_s} = \\frac{3.40323 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-2}s^{-1}}}{7.0 \\times 10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}} \\approx 48617.6\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\nCalculate the effective consumption rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{eff}} = k_{\\mathrm{des}} + k_{\\mathrm{rxn}} = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} + 15.0\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} = 20.0\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\nNow, calculate the steady-state coverages $\\theta_{\\mathrm{ss},1}$ and $\\theta_{\\mathrm{ss},2}$:\n$$\\theta_{\\mathrm{ss},1} = \\frac{s\\,J_{\\mathrm{site},1}}{s\\,J_{\\mathrm{site},1} + k_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{-3})(12154.4)}{ (1.0 \\times 10^{-3})(12154.4) + 20.0} = \\frac{12.1544}{12.1544 + 20.0} \\approx 0.378005$$\n$$\\theta_{\\mathrm{ss},2} = \\frac{s\\,J_{\\mathrm{site},2}}{s\\,J_{\\mathrm{site},2} + k_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{-3})(48617.6)}{ (1.0 \\times 10^{-3})(48617.6) + 20.0} = \\frac{48.6176}{48.6176 + 20.0} \\approx 0.708553$$\nCalculate the time constant $\\tau_2$:\n$$\\tau_2 = \\frac{1}{s\\,J_{\\mathrm{site},2} + k_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\frac{1}{68.6176\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}} \\approx 0.0145731\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nFinally, calculate $t_{95}$:\n$$t_{95} = \\tau_2 \\ln\\left(20\\left(1 - \\frac{\\theta_{\\mathrm{ss},1}}{\\theta_{\\mathrm{ss},2}}\\right)\\right) \\approx (0.0145731\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\ln\\left(20\\left(1 - \\frac{0.378005}{0.708553}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$t_{95} \\approx (0.0145731\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\ln\\left(20(1 - 0.53349)\\right) = (0.0145731\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\ln(20 \\times 0.46651)$$\n$$t_{95} \\approx (0.0145731\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\ln(9.3302) \\approx (0.0145731\\,\\mathrm{s})(2.23331) \\approx 0.032549\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $0.03255\\,\\mathrm{s}$.",
