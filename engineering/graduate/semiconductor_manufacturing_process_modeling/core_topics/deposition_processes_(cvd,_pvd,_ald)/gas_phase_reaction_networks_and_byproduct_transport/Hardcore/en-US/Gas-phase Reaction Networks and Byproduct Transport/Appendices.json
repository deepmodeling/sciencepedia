            "problem": "A gas-phase precursor species $A$ participates in a network of reactions during Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) for semiconductor manufacturing, where $A$ undergoes a homogeneous first-order gas-phase conversion to byproducts with rate constant $k_{g}$ and a heterogeneous loss at the chamber walls due to reaction/adsorption. The chamber can be approximated as a well-mixed bulk of volume $V$ bounded by internal surface area $S$, with a quasi-stagnant diffusive sublayer of thickness $\\delta$ everywhere adjacent to the walls. Species $A$ has bulk molar concentration $c(t)$ and molecular diffusion coefficient $D_{A}$. The wall uptake is characterized by an uptake coefficient $\\gamma$ defined as the fraction of gas-surface molecular collisions that lead to reaction, and the kinetic theory impingement of molecules on the wall is modeled by a mean molecular speed $\\bar{v}$ (from the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution). The heterogeneous wall reaction is linear in the wall concentration, with a surface reaction velocity $k_{s} = \\frac{1}{4}\\,\\gamma\\,\\bar{v}$, so that the reactive wall flux is $J_{\\mathrm{surf}} = k_{s}\\,c_{w}$, where $c_{w}$ is the concentration at the wall.\n\nStarting only from species conservation, Fick’s first law of diffusion, and kinetic theory for gas-wall molecular impingement, derive how the inclusion of the heterogeneous wall sink modifies the spatially averaged, first-order gas-phase loss rate for $A$ by expressing the wall-induced contribution as an effective first-order term that depends on $S/V$, $D_{A}$, $\\delta$, and $k_{s}$.

Provide your final answer as a closed-form analytic expression for $k_{m}$ in terms of $D_{A}$ and $\\delta$. No numerical evaluation is required.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard problem in chemical reaction engineering and transport phenomena, specifically related to modeling Heterogeneous Catalysis and Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) processes. The assumptions provided are consistent and sufficient for a unique solution. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe overall loss rate of precursor species $A$ is the sum of a homogeneous gas-phase reaction and a heterogeneous wall loss. We begin by formulating a mass balance for species $A$ within the bulk volume $V$. The concentration of $A$ in the well-mixed bulk is denoted by $c(t)$. The rate of change of the number of moles of $A$, which is $V c(t)$, is governed by the consumption processes.\n\nLet's write the species conservation equation:\n$$ \\frac{d(Vc)}{dt} = -(\\text{rate of loss from gas-phase reaction}) - (\\text{rate of loss at walls}) $$\nAssuming the volume $V$ is constant, this becomes:\n$$ V \\frac{dc}{dt} = -R_{\\text{gas}} - R_{\\text{wall}} $$\nThe gas-phase reaction is first-order with rate constant $k_g$. Its rate of consumption per unit volume is $k_g c$. Thus, the total rate of loss in the volume $V$ is $R_{\\text{gas}} = V k_g c$.\nThe wall loss occurs over the entire internal surface area $S$. The rate of loss is the product of the surface area and the flux $J$ of species $A$ from the bulk to the wall. Therefore, $R_{\\text{wall}} = S J$.\n\nSubstituting these terms into the mass balance gives:\n$$ V \\frac{dc}{dt} = -V k_g c - S J $$\nDividing by the volume $V$, we obtain the evolution equation for the bulk concentration:\n$$ \\frac{dc}{dt} = -k_g c - \\frac{S}{V} J $$\nOur goal is to express the flux $J$ in terms of the bulk concentration $c$ and the system parameters. The problem specifies a quasi-stagnant diffusive sublayer of thickness $\\delta$ adjacent to the walls. We assume a steady, one-dimensional transport process across this sublayer. Let the coordinate $z$ be normal to the surface, with $z=0$ representing the bulk side of the sublayer and $z=\\delta$ representing the wall surface. The concentrations at these boundaries are $c(z=0) = c$ (the bulk concentration) and $c(z=\\delta) = c_w$ (the wall concentration).\n\nAccording to Fick's first law of diffusion, the flux $J$ through the sublayer is given by:\n$$ J = -D_A \\frac{dc}{dz} $$\nFor a steady-state sublayer with no reactions within it, the flux $J$ must be constant with respect to $z$. This implies that the concentration gradient $\\frac{dc}{dz}$ is also constant, meaning the concentration profile is linear. We can thus write the gradient as:\n$$ \\frac{dc}{dz} = \\frac{c_w - c}{\\delta} $$\nSubstituting this into Fick's law gives the diffusive flux from the bulk to the wall:\n$$ J = -D_A \\left( \\frac{c_w - c}{\\delta} \\right) = \\frac{D_A}{\\delta} (c - c_w) $$\nThis flux represents the rate of mass transport to the surface.\n\nAt the surface ($z=\\delta$), this incoming diffusive flux must be balanced by the rate of consumption due to the surface reaction. The problem provides the reactive wall flux as $J_{\\mathrm{surf}} = k_s c_w$, where $k_s = \\frac{1}{4}\\gamma\\bar{v}$ is the surface reaction velocity.\nIn a steady state, the flux of species arriving at the surface must equal the flux of species being consumed at the surface:\n$$ J = J_{\\mathrm{surf}} $$\n$$ \\frac{D_A}{\\delta} (c - c_w) = k_s c_w $$\nThis equation allows us to find the unknown wall concentration $c_w$ in terms of the known bulk concentration $c$.\n$$ \\frac{D_A}{\\delta} c - \\frac{D_A}{\\delta} c_w = k_s c_w $$\n$$ \\frac{D_A}{\\delta} c = \\left( k_s + \\frac{D_A}{\\delta} \\right) c_w $$\n$$ c_w = c \\left( \\frac{D_A/\\delta}{k_s + D_A/\\delta} \\right) = c \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + k_s\\delta/D_A} \\right) $$\nNow, we can express the flux $J$ solely in terms of the bulk concentration $c$ by substituting $c_w$ back into the expression for the surface flux, $J = k_s c_w$:\n$$ J = k_s \\left[ c \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + k_s\\delta/D_A} \\right) \\right] = c \\left( \\frac{k_s}{1 + k_s\\delta/D_A} \\right) $$\nA more insightful form is obtained by algebraic manipulation:\n$$ J = c \\left( \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{k_s} + \\frac{\\delta}{D_A}} \\right) $$\nThis expression shows that the overall process consists of two resistances in series: a surface reaction resistance ($1/k_s$) and a diffusion resistance ($\\delta/D_A$).\n\nThe wall-induced contribution to the loss rate is the term $-\\frac{S}{V}J$. Substituting the derived expression for $J$ gives:\n$$ \\frac{dc}{dt} = -k_g c - \\frac{S}{V} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{k_s} + \\frac{\\delta}{D_A}} \\right) c $$\nThis can be written as $\\frac{dc}{dt} = -(k_g + k_{\\text{wall}})c$, where the effective first-order rate constant for wall loss is:\n$$ k_{\\text{wall}} = \\frac{S}{V} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{k_s} + \\frac{\\delta}{D_A}} \\right) $$\nThis expression depends on $S/V$, $D_A$, $\\delta$, and $k_s$, as required by the first part of the problem.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for the mass-transfer-limited rate constant $k_m$, which is defined as the coefficient relating the wall flux $J$ to the bulk concentration $c$ ($J = k_m c$) in the high-uptake limit. This limit corresponds to the case where the surface reaction is very fast compared to diffusion, i.e., $k_s \\gg D_A/\\delta$. This is equivalent to letting $k_s \\to \\infty$.\n\nFrom our general expression for the flux, $J = c \\left( \\frac{1}{1/k_s + \\delta/D_A} \\right)$, the coefficient relating $J$ and $c$ is $\\left( \\frac{1}{1/k_s + \\delta/D_A} \\right)$.\nWe can now find $k_m$ by taking the limit as $k_s \\to \\infty$:\n$$ k_m = \\lim_{k_s \\to \\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{k_s} + \\frac{\\delta}{D_A}} \\right) $$\nAs $k_s \\to \\infty$, the term $1/k_s \\to 0$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$ k_m = \\frac{1}{0 + \\frac{\\delta}{D_A}} = \\frac{D_A}{\\delta} $$\nIn this limit, the surface reaction resistance is negligible, and the overall rate of uptake at the wall is entirely controlled by the rate of diffusion across the sublayer. This is why $k_m$ is called the mass-transfer-limited rate constant. Physically, the wall acts as a \"perfect sink,\" meaning any molecule that reaches the surface is instantly consumed, driving the wall concentration $c_w$ to zero.\nSetting $c_w = 0$ in our earlier flux equation $J = \\frac{D_A}{\\delta} (c - c_w)$ directly yields $J = \\frac{D_A}{\\delta} c$, which confirms that $k_m = D_A/\\delta$.",

            "introduction": "Standard transport models often assume continuum behavior, an assumption that falters at the low pressures common in modern semiconductor processing. This practice introduces a more physically accurate description of gas-surface transport by implementing a slip boundary condition, which accounts for non-continuum effects when the molecular mean free path becomes significant . By quantifying the difference between continuum and slip-flow results, you will learn to assess when these advanced models are necessary and appreciate their impact on predicting mass transfer rates to a wafer.",

            "problem": "You are modeling gas-phase transport of hydrogen chloride ($\\mathrm{HCl}$) in a semiconductor etch reactor, focusing on the near-wall film transport to a wafer. At moderate rarefaction with Knudsen number $Kn \\approx 0.1$, classical no-slip boundary conditions fail to account for finite molecular mean free path effects. Under first-order kinetic theory, slip (jump) boundary conditions for species concentration at the wall introduce an additional interfacial resistance that modifies the wall mass transfer coefficient. Starting from the Maxwell–Stefan formulation (reduced to Fick’s law for a dilute binary mixture) and first-order jump boundary conditions derived from kinetic theory, derive the effective wall mass transfer coefficient and implement it in code.\n\nFundamental base:\n- Maxwell–Stefan diffusion reduces to Fick’s law for a dilute species in a stagnant or weakly convective binary gas, giving $J_y = -D \\,\\partial c / \\partial y$, where $J_y$ is the molar flux normal to the wall, $D$ is the binary diffusion coefficient, and $c$ is the molar concentration.\n- First-order slip (jump) boundary condition for species concentration at the wall in the transitional regime introduces a finite jump proportional to the normal gradient: $c_w - c(0) = b \\,\\lambda\\, \\left.\\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial y}\\right|_{y=0}$, where $c_w$ is the wall equilibrium concentration, $c(0)$ is the gas concentration evaluated at the wall plane, $\\lambda$ is the mean free path, and $b = \\dfrac{2-\\sigma_c}{\\sigma_c}$ depends on the mass accommodation coefficient $\\sigma_c$.\n- The Knudsen number is defined as $Kn = \\lambda/\\delta$, where $\\delta$ is a characteristic near-wall film thickness.\n\nAssume one-dimensional, steady diffusion across a film of thickness $\\delta$ with a bulk gas concentration $c_b$ at $y=\\delta$ and a wall equilibrium concentration $c_w$ at $y=0$. Let the imposed concentration driving difference be $\\Delta c = c_b - c_w$. Under continuum, no-slip conditions the wall mass transfer coefficient is $k_{m,0} = D/\\delta$, and the molar flux is $J_{0} = k_{m,0}\\,\\Delta c$. Under slip conditions, the effective wall mass transfer coefficient becomes $k_{m,\\mathrm{eff}}$ and flux $J_{\\mathrm{eff}} = k_{m,\\mathrm{eff}}\\Delta c$. Your task is to implement the slip boundary condition and quantify the change in $k_m$ and $J$ for $\\mathrm{HCl}$ at $Kn$ near $0.1$.\n\nPrecisely:\n- Use $k_{m,0} = D/\\delta$ and $k_{m,\\mathrm{eff}} = D/\\left(\\delta + b\\,\\lambda\\right) = \\dfrac{D}{\\delta\\left(1 + b\\,Kn\\right)}$, where $b = \\dfrac{2-\\sigma_c}{\\sigma_c}$ and $\\lambda = Kn\\,\\delta$.\n- Compute $J_0 = k_{m,0}\\,\\Delta c$ and $J_{\\mathrm{eff}} = k_{m,\\mathrm{eff}}\\,\\Delta c$.\n\nUnits and reporting:\n- Express diffusion coefficient $D$ in $\\mathrm{m^2/s}$, film thickness $\\delta$ in $\\mathrm{m}$, molar concentrations in $\\mathrm{mol/m^3}$, mass transfer coefficients $k_m$ in $\\mathrm{m/s}$, and fluxes $J$ in $\\mathrm{mol/(m^2\\,s)}$.\n- Report the final numerical values rounded to five significant figures.\n\nTest suite:\nFor each case, parameters are given as a tuple $\\left(D,\\delta,Kn,\\sigma_c,\\Delta c\\right)$:\n1. General case at transitional regime: $\\left(1.0\\times 10^{-4},\\,1.0\\times 10^{-3},\\,0.1,\\,0.9,\\,1.0\\right)$.\n2. Continuum limit reference: $\\left(1.0\\times 10^{-4},\\,1.0\\times 10^{-3},\\,0.0,\\,0.9,\\,1.0\\right)$.\n3. Low accommodation, thinner film: $\\left(8.0\\times 10^{-5},\\,5.0\\times 10^{-4},\\,0.1,\\,0.3,\\,0.5\\right)$.\n4. Near-continuum small Knudsen number: $\\left(5.0\\times 10^{-5},\\,1.0\\times 10^{-4},\\,0.01,\\,0.7,\\,2.0\\right)$.\n\nRequired final output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results for all test cases as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets.\n- Each test case result must be a list in the form $\\left[k_{m,0},\\,k_{m,\\mathrm{eff}},\\,J_0,\\,J_{\\mathrm{eff}},\\,r\\right]$ where $r = k_{m,\\mathrm{eff}}/k_{m,0}$ is dimensionless, and all entries are rounded to five significant figures.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the effective mass transfer coefficient, $k_{m,\\mathrm{eff}}$, for a species diffusing across a film of thickness $\\delta$ under slip-flow conditions.\n\nWe begin with the one-dimensional, steady-state diffusion equation (Fick's first law) for the molar flux $J_y$ normal to the wall:\n$$\nJ_y = -D \\frac{dc}{dy}\n$$\nSince the flux must be constant across the stagnant film in a steady state, the concentration gradient $\\frac{dc}{dy}$ is also constant. We can integrate this equation across the film thickness, from the wall plane at $y=0$ to the edge of the film at $y=\\delta$:\n$$\n\\int_{c(0)}^{c_b} dc = -\\frac{J_y}{D} \\int_0^\\delta dy\n$$\nThis gives a relationship between the bulk concentration $c_b$, the gas concentration at the wall $c(0)$, and the flux:\n$$\nc_b - c(0) = \\frac{J_y \\delta}{D}\n$$\nThis equation describes the concentration drop across the bulk of the film.\n\nNext, we apply the first-order slip (or concentration jump) boundary condition at the wall ($y=0$). This condition relates the jump between the true concentration of the gas at the wall, $c(0)$, and the concentration that would be in equilibrium with the wall surface, $c_w$:\n$$\nc_w - c(0) = b \\lambda \\left.\\frac{dc}{dy}\\right|_{y=0}\n$$\nwhere $b = \\frac{2-\\sigma_c}{\\sigma_c}$ and $\\lambda$ is the mean free path. We can substitute the constant gradient $\\frac{dc}{dy} = -\\frac{J_y}{D}$ into the slip condition:\n$$\nc_w - c(0) = b \\lambda \\left(-\\frac{J_y}{D}\\right)\n$$\nRearranging gives the concentration jump at the interface in terms of the flux:\n$$\nc(0) - c_w = \\frac{J_y b \\lambda}{D}\n$$\nThis equation describes the additional resistance to mass transfer right at the gas-surface interface, which is absent in the continuum (no-slip) model.\n\nThe total concentration driving force for the process is $\\Delta c = c_b - c_w$. We can express this as the sum of the drop across the film and the jump at the wall:\n$$\n\\Delta c = (c_b - c(0)) + (c(0) - c_w)\n$$\nSubstituting our expressions for these two terms yields:\n$$\n\\Delta c = \\frac{J_y \\delta}{D} + \\frac{J_y b \\lambda}{D} = J_y \\left( \\frac{\\delta + b\\lambda}{D} \\right)\n$$\nThe effective mass transfer coefficient, $k_{m,\\mathrm{eff}}$, is defined by the relation $J_y = k_{m,\\mathrm{eff}} \\Delta c$. Solving our equation for $J_y$ gives:\n$$\nJ_y = \\frac{\\Delta c}{(\\delta + b\\lambda)/D} = \\left( \\frac{D}{\\delta + b\\lambda} \\right) \\Delta c\n$$\nTherefore, the effective mass transfer coefficient is:\n$$\nk_{m,\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{D}{\\delta + b\\lambda}\n$$\nUsing the definition of the Knudsen number, $Kn = \\lambda/\\delta$, we can rewrite this as:\n$$\nk_{m,\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{D}{\\delta(1 + b Kn)}\n$$\nThis result demonstrates that slip effects (when $Kn>0$) introduce an additional transport resistance, reducing the mass transfer coefficient compared to the continuum value, $k_{m,0} = D/\\delta$. The problem requires implementing this derived formula to calculate the fluxes and their ratio.",
