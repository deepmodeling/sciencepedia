            "problem": "A molecular beam sticking experiment is performed on a clean metal surface with a uniform lattice of adsorption sites. The instantaneous sticking probability $S(\\theta)$ is defined as the fraction of incident molecules that become chemisorbed upon impact when the chemisorbed coverage is $\\theta$ (with $\\theta \\in [0,1]$). Consider two limiting mechanistic pictures:\n\n(i) Direct Langmuir adsorption: an incident molecule chemisorbs irreversibly if it encounters a single vacant site upon impact; there are no lateral interactions beyond steric exclusion, sites are equivalent, and impacts are random over the surface.\n\n(ii) Precursor-mediated adsorption: an incident molecule first traps in a mobile, weakly bound physisorbed precursor state $P^*$ with desorption rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{des}}$, surface diffusion rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{diff}}$, and conversion rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{chem}}$ to a chemisorbed state $C^*$ when the diffusing precursor encounters a vacant chemisorption site. The physisorption well has depth $E_{\\mathrm{phys}}$ relative to the gas phase, the diffusion barrier is $E_{\\mathrm{diff}}$, and the activation barrier to chemisorption from $P^*$ is $E_a$. Assume molecular (non-dissociative) chemisorption unless otherwise stated, negligible readsorption from the gas phase, and that $\\theta$ counts only chemisorbed $C^*$.\n\nUsing only (a) random occupancy and site exclusion, and (b) rate competition among $k_{\\mathrm{diff}}$, $k_{\\mathrm{des}}$, and $k_{\\mathrm{chem}}$ together with Arrhenius-type temperature dependences $k \\sim \\nu \\exp(-E/k_{\\mathrm{B}} T)$, identify the option that correctly states both:\n\n(1) the functional dependence of $S(\\theta)$ that follows from direct Langmuir adsorption with site blocking and the physical reason for it, and\n\n(2) the qualitative signature in $S(\\theta)$ that indicates a mobile, precursor-mediated mechanism and the corresponding inequalities among $k_{\\mathrm{diff}}$, $k_{\\mathrm{des}}$, $k_{\\mathrm{chem}}$ and energetic conditions on $E_{\\mathrm{phys}}$, $E_{\\mathrm{diff}}$, and $E_a$ under which it arises.\n\nA. Direct Langmuir adsorption with random site blocking gives $S(\\theta)=S_0(1-\\theta)$ because only a fraction $(1-\\theta)$ of impacts land on vacant sites and the intrinsic sticking on an empty surface is $S_0$. A mobile precursor produces a weaker-than-linear decay of $S(\\theta)$ with increasing $\\theta$ (concave-up shape), because a trapped molecule samples many sites during its residence time and thus still finds a vacancy until $\\theta$ is high. This requires $k_{\\mathrm{diff}} \\gg k_{\\mathrm{des}}$ so that many distinct sites are sampled within a residence time $\\tau \\sim 1/k_{\\mathrm{des}}$, and $k_{\\mathrm{chem}} \\gtrsim k_{\\mathrm{des}}$ so that conversion is competitive with desorption. Energetically, $E_{\\mathrm{phys}} \\gtrsim \\mathcal{O}(k_{\\mathrm{B}} T)$ to ensure trapping, $E_{\\mathrm{diff}}$ small to permit rapid surface diffusion, and $E_a$ not so large that $k_{\\mathrm{chem}}$ is negligible.\n\nB. Linear $S(\\theta)$ indicates dissociative adsorption that requires $2$ adjacent vacant sites, while deviations toward weaker-than-linear decay at intermediate $\\theta$ arise from strong lateral repulsions; precursor mobility does not change $S(\\theta)$ because $P^*$ does not alter site availability. Thus $S(\\theta)=S_0(1-\\theta)$ reflects a $2$-site requirement and deviations do not imply a precursor.\n\nC. In Langmuir adsorption, $S(\\theta)$ is independent of $\\theta$ because impacts are random; any observed $\\theta$-dependence, whether weaker-than-linear or stronger-than-linear, signals a precursor-mediated pathway. The precursor signature does not depend on $k_{\\mathrm{diff}}$ versus $k_{\\mathrm{des}}$ because conversion is instantaneous once trapped.\n\nD. A precursor-mediated mechanism necessarily produces a stronger-than-linear decrease, $S(\\theta) \\propto (1-\\theta)^2$, because the physisorbed state blocks sites and enhances steric hindrance; by contrast, direct adsorption without a precursor is less sensitive to blocking, $S(\\theta) \\propto (1-\\theta)^\\alpha$ with $\\alpha<1$ if there are attractive lateral interactions.

Assumptions include no lateral interactions beyond steric exclusion, equivalent sites, and random impacts.\n-   **Mechanism (ii) - Precursor-Mediated Adsorption**: An incident molecule first traps into a mobile physisorbed precursor state ($P^*$) and then may convert to a chemisorbed state ($C^*$) upon encountering a vacant site. This process involves competition between desorption ($k_{\\mathrm{des}}$), surface diffusion ($k_{\\mathrm{diff}}$), and chemisorption ($k_{\\mathrm{chem}}$).\n-   **Energy Scales**: Physisorption well depth $E_{\\mathrm{phys}}$, diffusion barrier $E_{\\mathrm{diff}}$, and activation barrier to chemisorption $E_a$.\n-   **Task**: Identify the option that correctly describes:\n    $1$.

The qualitative signature of a mobile precursor mechanism in $S(\\theta)$ and the relevant kinetic and energetic conditions.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement describes two canonical models of surface adsorption kinetics: the Langmuir model for direct adsorption and the precursor-mediated model (often formalized by the Kisliuk model). All terms used—sticking probability, coverage, rate constants, Arrhenius dependence, physisorption, chemisorption—are standard and well-defined in the field of surface science and chemical kinetics. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It poses a standard conceptual question based on established physical theories. The assumptions for each model are clearly stated and are not contradictory. The problem is valid.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\n\n**Part 1: Direct Langmuir Adsorption**\n\nAccording to the postulates of Langmuir adsorption:\n1.  Adsorption is restricted to a fixed number of identical sites.\n2.  Each site can hold at most one molecule (monolayer coverage, steric exclusion).\n3.  Impacts on the surface are random.\n4.  There are no lateral interactions between adsorbed molecules.\n\nThe coverage $\\theta$ is the fraction of sites that are occupied. Therefore, the fraction of sites that are vacant is $(1-\\theta)$.\nAn incoming molecule from the gas phase will strike the surface at a random position. The probability that this position corresponds to a vacant site is simply the fraction of vacant sites, which is $(1-\\theta)$.\nThe problem states that an incident molecule chemisorbs if it encounters a single vacant site. Let $S_0$ be the intrinsic sticking probability on a completely empty surface ($\\theta=0$). This factor accounts for any dynamic effects (e.g., inefficient energy transfer) that prevent sticking even upon impact with a vacant site. The sticking probability at a given coverage, $S(\\theta)$, is the product of the probability of hitting a vacant site and the intrinsic probability of sticking on that site.\nAssuming the intrinsic sticking probability on any given vacant site is constant and equal to $S_0$, we have:\n$$S(\\theta) = S_0 \\times (\\text{Probability of hitting a vacant site})$$\n$$S(\\theta) = S_0 (1-\\theta)$$\nThis linear relationship is a direct consequence of random site blocking. As coverage increases, the number of available sites for adsorption decreases linearly, and thus the sticking probability decreases linearly.\n\n**Part 2: Precursor-Mediated Adsorption**\n\nIn this mechanism, an incident molecule does not need to hit a vacant site directly. It can first trap in a weakly bound, mobile physisorbed state (the \"precursor\"). This initial trapping occurs with some probability, often called the accommodation coefficient.\nOnce in the precursor state, the molecule resides on the surface for a characteristic time $\\tau_{\\text{res}} \\sim 1/k_{\\text{des}}$ before it desorbs. During this time, it can diffuse across the surface with a hopping rate related to $k_{\\text{diff}}$.\nThe key feature of this mechanism is the precursor's mobility. A molecule that initially lands on an already occupied chemisorption site is not lost. It can diffuse across the surface, \"searching\" for a vacant site. If it finds a vacant site before desorbing, it may convert to the strongly bound chemisorbed state with a rate constant $k_{\\text{chem}}$.\n\nThe overall sticking probability is thus a product of the initial trapping probability and the probability that the precursor successfully chemisorbs before desorbing. The ability to search for a vacant site means that the sticking probability will remain high even at moderate coverages, in stark contrast to the direct Langmuir model. $S(\\theta)$ will decrease much more slowly with $\\theta$ than a linear function, resulting in a curve that is concave-up. Only when the surface is nearly saturated ($\\theta \\to 1$) does the probability of finding a vacant site during the precursor's lifetime drop sharply to zero.\n\nThe conditions for this behavior are based on the competition between the relevant kinetic processes:\n1.  **High mobility**: The precursor must be able to sample many different sites during its residence time on the surface. This requires the diffusion rate to be much greater than the desorption rate: $k_{\\mathrm{diff}} \\gg k_{\\mathrm{des}}$. Energetically, this translates to the diffusion barrier being much smaller than the physisorption well depth: $E_{\\mathrm{diff}} \\ll E_{\\mathrm{phys}}$. The Arrhenius forms are $k_{\\mathrm{diff}} \\sim \\exp(-E_{\\mathrm{diff}}/k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)$ and $k_{\\mathrm{des}} \\sim \\exp(-E_{\\mathrm{phys}}/k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)$.\n2.  **Sufficient residence time**: For the precursor state to be relevant, the molecule must actually trap on the surface for a finite time. This means the physisorption well must be deep enough to hold the molecule against its thermal energy: $E_{\\mathrm{phys}} \\gtrsim k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$.\n3.  **Efficient conversion**: Once a vacant site is found, the conversion to the chemisorbed state must be a likely event. This means the rate of chemisorption, $k_{\\mathrm{chem}}$, must be competitive with the rate of desorption, $k_{\\mathrm{des}}$. A reasonable condition is $k_{\\mathrm{chem}} \\gtrsim k_{\\mathrm{des}}$. Energetically, this means the activation barrier for chemisorption from the precursor state, $E_a$, cannot be prohibitively high compared to $E_{\\mathrm{phys}}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Direct Langmuir adsorption with random site blocking gives $S(\\theta)=S_0(1-\\theta)$ because only a fraction $(1-\\theta)$ of impacts land on vacant sites and the intrinsic sticking on an empty surface is $S_0$. A mobile precursor produces a weaker-than-linear decay of $S(\\theta)$ with increasing $\\theta$ (concave-up shape), because a trapped molecule samples many sites during its residence time and thus still finds a vacancy until $\\theta$ is high. This requires $k_{\\mathrm{diff}} \\gg k_{\\mathrm{des}}$ so that many distinct sites are sampled within a residence time $\\tau \\sim 1/k_{\\mathrm{des}}$, and $k_{\\mathrm{chem}} \\gtrsim k_{\\mathrm{des}}$ so that conversion is competitive with desorption. Energetically, $E_{\\mathrm{phys}} \\gtrsim \\mathcal{O}(k_{\\mathrm{B}} T)$ to ensure trapping, $E_{\\mathrm{diff}}$ small to permit rapid surface diffusion, and $E_a$ not so large that $k_{\\mathrm{chem}}$ is negligible.**\n\nThis option correctly states that Langmuir adsorption leads to $S(\\theta) = S_0(1-\\theta)$ due to site blocking. It correctly identifies the signature of a precursor mechanism as a weaker-than-linear decay (concave-up) and correctly explains it in terms of the precursor's mobility. Furthermore, it correctly specifies the necessary kinetic conditions ($k_{\\mathrm{diff}} \\gg k_{\\mathrm{des}}$, $k_{\\mathrm{chem}} \\gtrsim k_{\\mathrm{des}}$) and their energetic underpinnings ($E_{\\mathrm{phys}} \\gtrsim k_{\\mathrm{B}} T$, small $E_{\\mathrm{diff}}$, and non-prohibitive $E_a$).\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Linear $S(\\theta)$ indicates dissociative adsorption that requires $2$ adjacent vacant sites, while deviations toward weaker-than-linear decay at intermediate $\\theta$ arise from strong lateral repulsions; precursor mobility does not change $S(\\theta)$ because $P^*$ does not alter site availability. Thus $S(\\theta)=S_0(1-\\theta)$ reflects a $2$-site requirement and deviations do not imply a precursor.**\n\nThis option is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, dissociative adsorption requiring $2$ adjacent sites leads to a stronger-than-linear dependence, typically modeled as $S(\\theta) \\propto (1-\\theta)^2$, not a linear one. Second, strong lateral repulsions also lead to a stronger-than-linear decay (concave-down), not a weaker one. Third, the statement that precursor mobility does not change $S(\\theta)$ is fundamentally wrong; mobility is the defining feature that distinguishes its kinetics from direct adsorption.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. In Langmuir adsorption, $S(\\theta)$ is independent of $\\theta$ because impacts are random; any observed $\\theta$-dependence, whether weaker-than-linear or stronger-than-linear, signals a precursor-mediated pathway. The precursor signature does not depend on $k_{\\mathrm{diff}}$ versus $k_{\\mathrm{des}}$ because conversion is instantaneous once trapped.**\n\nThis option is incorrect. Langmuir adsorption explicitly predicts $S(\\theta) \\propto (1-\\theta)$, which is a strong dependence on $\\theta$ due to site blocking. Stating it is independent of $\\theta$ is a fundamental error. The dependence of $S$ on $\\theta$ is not, by itself, a signal of a precursor. The *form* of the dependence is the signal. Finally, the competition between $k_{\\mathrm{diff}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{des}}$ is absolutely critical for the mobile precursor mechanism.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. A precursor-mediated mechanism necessarily produces a stronger-than-linear decrease, $S(\\theta) \\propto (1-\\theta)^2$, because the physisorbed state blocks sites and enhances steric hindrance; by contrast, direct adsorption without a precursor is less sensitive to blocking, $S(\\theta) \\propto (1-\\theta)^\\alpha$ with $\\alpha<1$ if there are attractive lateral interactions. The condition for the precursor signature is $k_{\\mathrm{des}} \\gg k_{\\mathrm{diff}}$ so that trapped molecules cannot migrate to find vacancies, and $E_{\\mathrm{phys}} \\ll k_{\\mathrm{B}} T$ so that trapping is brief.**\n\nThis option has the physics reversed. A mobile precursor leads to a *weaker*-than-linear decrease, not stronger. The kinetic condition for a mobile precursor is $k_{\\mathrm{diff}} \\gg k_{\\mathrm{des}}$, not $k_{\\mathrm{des}} \\gg k_{\\mathrm{diff}}$. The latter describes an immobile precursor that would yield Langmuir-like kinetics. The energetic condition for trapping is $E_{\\mathrm{phys}} \\gtrsim k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$, not $E_{\\mathrm{phys}} \\ll k_{\\mathrm{B}} T$. The latter condition implies no significant trapping would occur.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe net sticking probability, $S$, is the total probability that an incident molecule ultimately becomes chemisorbed on the surface. According to the specified model, chemisorption can occur through two mutually exclusive pathways:\n1.  Direct chemisorption from the initial hot state.\n2.  Chemisorption from the thermally accommodated precursor state, which is reached after the hot state.\n\nThe total probability $S$ is the sum of the probabilities of these two pathways, based on the law of total probability. Let $P(\\text{HC})$ be the probability of direct chemisorption from the hot state, and let $P(\\text{PC})$ be the probability of chemisorption from the precursor state.\n$$S = P(\\text{HC}) + P(\\text{accommodation}) \\times P(\\text{PC} | \\text{accommodated})$$\nHere, $P(\\text{accommodation})$ is the probability of transitioning from the hot state to the precursor state, and $P(\\text{PC} | \\text{accommodated})$ is the conditional probability of chemisorbing once in the precursor state.\n\nThe problem states that all reaction channels are governed by exponential waiting times, which corresponds to competing first-order kinetic processes. For a set of competing, independent Poisson processes with rates $k_1, k_2, \\dots, k_n$, the probability that process $i$ occurs first is given by the ratio of its rate to the sum of all competing rates: $P_i = k_i / \\sum_{j=1}^{n} k_j$. This fundamental principle will be used to derive the probabilities for each step.\n\nFirst, consider the molecule in the initial hot state. It faces three competing channels: direct chemisorption (rate $k_{hc}$), thermal accommodation (rate $k_{ha}$), and prompt desorption (rate $k_{hd}$). The total rate of exit from the hot state is the sum of these individual rates:\n$$k_{\\text{hot, total}} = k_{hc} + k_{ha} + k_{hd}$$\nThe probability of direct chemisorption, $P(\\text{HC})$, is the fraction of the total rate corresponding to this channel:\n$$P(\\text{HC}) = \\frac{k_{hc}}{k_{hc} + k_{ha} + k_{hd}}$$\nThe probability of thermal accommodation, $P(\\text{accommodation})$, is similarly given by:\n$$P(\\text{accommodation}) = \\frac{k_{ha}}{k_{hc} + k_{ha} + k_{hd}}$$\n\nNext, if the molecule successfully accommodates to the precursor state, it then faces two new competing channels: diffusion-mediated chemisorption (rate $k_{pc}$) and desorption (rate $k_{pd}$). The total rate of exit from the precursor state is:\n$$k_{\\text{precursor, total}} = k_{pc} + k_{pd}$$\nThe conditional probability of chemisorbing from this precursor state, $P(\\text{PC} | \\text{accommodated})$, is the fraction of the total rate corresponding to chemisorption:\n$$P(\\text{PC} | \\text{accommodated}) = \\frac{k_{pc}}{k_{pc} + k_{pd}}$$\n\nCombining these expressions, the net sticking probability $S$ is the sum of the direct chemisorption probability and the product of the accommodation probability and the subsequent precursor chemisorption probability:\n$$S = \\frac{k_{hc}}{k_{hc} + k_{ha} + k_{hd}} + \\left( \\frac{k_{ha}}{k_{hc} + k_{ha} + k_{hd}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{k_{pc}}{k_{pc} + k_{pd}} \\right)$$\nThis is the derived analytic expression for the net sticking probability.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically using the given rate constants:\n$k_{hc} = 2.0 \\times 10^{9} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}$\n$k_{ha} = 3.0 \\times 10^{10} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}$\n$k_{hd} = 1.0 \\times 10^{9} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}$\n$k_{pc} = 1.2 \\times 10^{6} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}$\n$k_{pd} = 8.0 \\times 10^{5} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, calculate the sum of rates for the hot state:\n$$k_{\\text{hot, total}} = (2.0 \\times 10^{9}) + (3.0 \\times 10^{10}) + (1.0 \\times 10^{9}) = (0.2 \\times 10^{10}) + (3.0 \\times 10^{10}) + (0.1 \\times 10^{10})$$\n$$k_{\\text{hot, total}} = (0.2 + 3.0 + 0.1) \\times 10^{10} = 3.3 \\times 10^{10} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}$$\n\nNext, calculate the sum of rates for the precursor state:\n$$k_{\\text{precursor, total}} = (1.2 \\times 10^{6}) + (8.0 \\times 10^{5}) = (1.2 \\times 10^{6}) + (0.8 \\times 10^{6})$$\n$$k_{\\text{precursor, total}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{6} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}$$\n\nNow, substitute these values into the expression for $S$:\n$$S = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{9}}{3.3 \\times 10^{10}} + \\left( \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{10}}{3.3 \\times 10^{10}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1.2 \\times 10^{6}}{2.0 \\times 10^{6}} \\right)$$\n$$S = \\frac{2.0}{33.0} + \\left( \\frac{30.0}{33.0} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1.2}{2.0} \\right)$$\n$$S = \\frac{2}{33} + \\left( \\frac{10}{11} \\right) \\times (0.6)$$\n$$S = \\frac{2}{33} + \\frac{6}{11}$$\nTo add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $33$:\n$$S = \\frac{2}{33} + \\frac{6 \\times 3}{11 \\times 3} = \\frac{2}{33} + \\frac{18}{33}$$\n$$S = \\frac{2 + 18}{33} = \\frac{20}{33}$$\nFinally, we convert this fraction to a decimal and round to four significant figures:\n$$S = \\frac{20}{33} \\approx 0.60606060...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$S \\approx 0.6061$$",

The problem states that the sticking probability is equal to the TMAC.\n\nLet $u(y)$ be the tangential gas velocity at a distance $y$ from the wall. The wall is located at $y=0$. The slip velocity is $u_s = u(y=0)$. For a stationary wall, $u_w = 0$, so $u_{\\text{slip}} = u_s$.\n\nA fundamental concept in the kinetic theory of slip flow is that molecules colliding with the wall have, on average, traveled a distance on the order of one mean free path, $\\lambda$, since their last intermolecular collision. Therefore, the average tangential velocity of molecules incident on the wall, $u_{\\text{inc}}$, can be approximated by the bulk gas velocity at $y=\\lambda$. Using a first-order Taylor series expansion of the velocity profile $u(y)$ around the wall at $y=0$, we have:\n$$u_{\\text{inc}} \\approx u(\\lambda) = u(0) + \\lambda \\left.\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right|_{y=0} = u_s + \\lambda \\left.\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right|_w$$\n\nNext, we model the average tangential velocity of molecules reflecting from the wall, $u_{\\text{ref}}$. According to the Maxwell model:\n- A fraction $\\sigma_v$ of molecules reflect diffusely. These molecules fully accommodate to the wall and are re-emitted with the wall's tangential velocity, $u_w$.\n- A fraction $1 - \\sigma_v$ of molecules reflect specularly. These molecules conserve their tangential velocity, so their post-collision tangential velocity is the same as their pre-collision velocity, $u_{\\text{inc}}$.\nThe average velocity of the reflected molecules is the weighted average of these two outcomes:\n$$u_{\\text{ref}} = \\sigma_v u_w + (1 - \\sigma_v) u_{\\text{inc}}$$\n\nThe gas velocity at the wall, $u_s$, represents the average velocity of all molecules (both incident and reflected) in the infinitesimally thin layer at $y=0$. Assuming equal number fluxes for incident and reflected molecules, $u_s$ is the arithmetic mean of $u_{\\text{inc}}$ and $u_{\\text{ref}}$:\n$$u_s = \\frac{1}{2} (u_{\\text{inc}} + u_{\\text{ref}})$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $u_{\\text{ref}}$ into this equation gives:\n$$u_s = \\frac{1}{2} (u_{\\text{inc}} + [\\sigma_v u_w + (1 - \\sigma_v) u_{\\text{inc}}])$$\n$$u_s = \\frac{1}{2} (2 - \\sigma_v) u_{\\text{inc}} + \\frac{\\sigma_v}{2} u_w$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for $u_{\\text{inc}}$ into the above equation:\n$$u_s = \\frac{2 - \\sigma_v}{2} \\left( u_s + \\lambda \\left.\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right|_w \\right) + \\frac{\\sigma_v}{2} u_w$$\n\nTo find the slip velocity $u_{\\text{slip}} = u_s - u_w$, we rearrange the equation to solve for $u_s$:\n$$u_s - \\frac{2 - \\sigma_v}{2} u_s = \\frac{2 - \\sigma_v}{2} \\lambda \\left.\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right|_w + \\frac{\\sigma_v}{2} u_w$$\n$$u_s \\left(1 - \\frac{2 - \\sigma_v}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2 - \\sigma_v}{2} \\lambda \\left.\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right|_w + \\frac{\\sigma_v}{2} u_w$$\n$$u_s \\left(\\frac{2 - (2 - \\sigma_v)}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2 - \\sigma_v}{2} \\lambda \\left.\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right|_w + \\frac{\\sigma_v}{2} u_w$$\n$$u_s \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_v}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2 - \\sigma_v}{2} \\lambda \\left.\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right|_w + \\frac{\\sigma_v}{2} u_w$$\nMultiplying both sides by $\\frac{2}{\\sigma_v}$ isolates $u_s$:\n$$u_s = \\frac{2 - \\sigma_v}{\\sigma_v} \\lambda \\left.\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right|_w + u_w$$\n\nFrom this, we obtain the derived first-order velocity slip boundary condition for the slip velocity, $u_{\\text{slip}} = u_s - u_w$:\n$$u_{\\text{slip}} = \\frac{2 - \\sigma_v}{\\sigma_v} \\lambda \\left.\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right|_w$$\n\nNow, we can compute the numerical value of $u_{\\text{slip}}$ using the data provided in the problem statement:\n- Sticking probability (TMAC) $\\sigma_{v} = 0.80$.\n- Mean free path $\\lambda = 3.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n- Near-wall tangential velocity gradient $\\left.\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right|_{w} = 1.0 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$u_{\\text{slip}} = \\frac{2 - 0.80}{0.80} \\times (3.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})$$\n$$u_{\\text{slip}} = \\frac{1.20}{0.80} \\times (3.0 \\times 10^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{m/s})$$\n$$u_{\\text{slip}} = 1.5 \\times 0.30\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$$\n$$u_{\\text{slip}} = 0.45\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$u_{\\text{slip}} = 0.450\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$$\nThis is the magnitude of the tangential velocity slip at the wall.",
