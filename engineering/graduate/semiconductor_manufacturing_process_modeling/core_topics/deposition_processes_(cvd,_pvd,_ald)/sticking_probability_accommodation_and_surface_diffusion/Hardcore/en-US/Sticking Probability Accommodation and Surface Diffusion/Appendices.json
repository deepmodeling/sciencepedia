            "problem": "In Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE), the kinetic sticking coefficient $s$ and the probability of incorporation $p_{\\mathrm{inc}}$ are both used to quantify the fate of incident species, but they encode distinct physical processes. Consider a single-species deposition on a crystalline substrate held at temperature $T$, with incident flux $J$ (number per unit area per unit time). Upon arrival, a fraction $s$ of the incident species becomes adsorbed as mobile adatoms after rapid energy accommodation, while a fraction $\\left(1-s\\right)$ is reflected or promptly re-evaporated. An adsorbed adatom subsequently undergoes thermally activated processes: it may desorb with a rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{des}}$ or be irreversibly incorporated into the crystal at sinks (e.g., steps, kinks, island edges) with an effective capture/incorporation rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{inc}}$. Assume dilute adatom coverage so that adatom-adatom interactions are negligible, detailed balance applies locally for adsorption/desorption, desorption of incorporated atoms is negligible, and the time evolution of the adatom population can be modeled by first-order kinetics for desorption and an effective first-order sink term for incorporation that coarse-grains diffusion to sinks into $k_{\\mathrm{inc}}$. The adatom diffusivity is $D=D_{0}\\exp\\!\\left(-E_{\\mathrm{diff}}/k_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\right)$, the desorption rate constant is $k_{\\mathrm{des}}=\\nu_{\\mathrm{des}}\\exp\\!\\left(-E_{\\mathrm{des}}/k_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\right)$, and an order-of-magnitude estimate for the incorporation rate constant in step-flow is $k_{\\mathrm{inc}}\\sim D/\\ell^{2}$, where $\\ell$ is the mean spacing between sinks.\n\nUsing the above physically motivated model and starting from conservation of flux and first-order rate laws, reason about the relationship between $s$ and $p_{\\mathrm{inc}}$ (where $p_{\\mathrm{inc}}$ is defined as the ratio of the incorporation rate to the incident flux $J$ at steady state). Which of the following statements are correct? Select all that apply.\n\nA. $s$ and $p_{\\mathrm{inc}}$ are identical by definition because both quantify the fraction of incident particles that bind permanently to the surface.\n\nB. $s$ quantifies the short-time probability that an incident particle becomes adsorbed (for at least a vibrational period), whereas $p_{\\mathrm{inc}}$ quantifies the eventual probability that an incident particle becomes part of the crystal; in general $p_{\\mathrm{inc}}\\le s$, and $p_{\\mathrm{inc}}\\approx s$ when the mean residence time for desorption is much longer than the mean time to incorporation.\n\nC. Increasing $T$ necessarily drives $p_{\\mathrm{inc}}$ closer to $s$ because higher $T$ increases $D$ and thus accelerates incorporation relative to desorption.\n\nD. In a compound semiconductor grown under strongly group-III-limited conditions with a large group-V overpressure (e.g., GaAs with high arsenic flux), the group-III species typically exhibits $p_{\\mathrm{inc}}\\approx s$ because desorption before incorporation is negligible on the growth timescale.\n\nE.

            "solution": "The problem statement describes a kinetic model for single-species deposition on a crystalline surface, as is common in the analysis of Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE). The model is scientifically sound, well-posed, and based on standard principles of surface science and chemical kinetics. All terms are defined, and the assumptions are explicitly stated. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed to a solution.\n\nThe core of the problem requires establishing the relationship between the kinetic sticking coefficient, $s$, and the incorporation probability, $p_{\\mathrm{inc}}$, based on a rate equation model for the adatom population.\n\nLet $n$ be the number density of mobile adatoms on the surface, in units of number per area. The rate of change of this density, $\\frac{dn}{dt}$, is determined by the balance of three fluxes: the flux of species adsorbing onto the surface, the flux of adatoms desorbing from the surface, and the flux of adatoms being incorporated into the crystal lattice.\n\n1.  **Adsorption Flux**: The incident flux of particles is $J$. A fraction $s$ of these successfully adsorb. Thus, the rate of increase of $n$ due to adsorption is $sJ$.\n\n2.  **Desorption Flux**: Desorption is modeled as a first-order process with rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{des}}$. The rate of loss of adatoms per unit area due to desorption is $k_{\\mathrm{des}}n$.\n\n3.  **Incorporation Flux**: Incorporation at sinks is also modeled as an effective first-order process with rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{inc}}$. The rate of loss of adatoms per unit area due to incorporation is $k_{\\mathrm{inc}}n$.\n\nCombining these terms, we write the rate equation for the adatom population density:\n$$ \\frac{dn}{dt} = sJ - k_{\\mathrm{des}}n - k_{\\mathrm{inc}}n = sJ - (k_{\\mathrm{des}} + k_{\\mathrm{inc}})n $$\nThe problem asks for the relationship at steady state. In steady state, the adatom density is constant, so $\\frac{dn}{dt} = 0$. We denote the steady-state adatom density as $n_{\\mathrm{ss}}$.\n$$ 0 = sJ - (k_{\\mathrm{des}} + k_{\\mathrm{inc}})n_{\\mathrm{ss}} $$\nSolving for $n_{\\mathrm{ss}}$, we find:\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{sJ}{k_{\\mathrm{des}} + k_{\\mathrm{inc}}} $$\nThe problem defines the incorporation probability, $p_{\\mathrm{inc}}$, as the ratio of the incorporation rate to the incident flux $J$ at steady state. The incorporation rate (per unit area) is $k_{\\mathrm{inc}}n_{\\mathrm{ss}}$.\n$$ p_{\\mathrm{inc}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{inc}}n_{\\mathrm{ss}}}{J} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $n_{\\mathrm{ss}}$:\n$$ p_{\\mathrm{inc}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{inc}}}{J} \\left( \\frac{sJ}{k_{\\mathrm{des}} + k_{\\mathrm{inc}}} \\right) $$\nThis simplifies to the fundamental relationship:\n$$ p_{\\mathrm{inc}} = s \\left( \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{inc}}}{k_{\\mathrm{des}} + k_{\\mathrm{inc}}} \\right) $$\nThis equation shows that $p_{\\mathrm{inc}}$ is the product of the probability of initial adsorption ($s$) and the branching ratio for an adsorbed particle to be incorporated versus being removed (by either incorporation or desorption). The term $\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{inc}}}{k_{\\mathrm{des}} + k_{\\mathrm{inc}}}$ is the probability that an adatom is incorporated, given that it has already adsorbed.\n\nWith this relationship, we now evaluate each option.\n\n**A. $s$ and $p_{\\mathrm{inc}}$ are identical by definition because both quantify the fraction of incident particles that bind permanently to the surface.**\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. The problem statement itself defines two distinct processes: initial adsorption quantified by $s$, and subsequent fate, which can be either desorption or permanent incorporation. Our derived formula $p_{\\mathrm{inc}} = s \\left( \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{inc}}}{k_{\\mathrm{des}} + k_{\\mathrm{inc}}} \\right)$ clearly shows that $p_{\\mathrm{inc}}$ is only equal to $s$ in the limit where $k_{\\mathrm{des}} \\rightarrow 0$ or $k_{\\mathrm{inc}} \\gg k_{\\mathrm{des}}$. They are not identical by definition.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. $s$ quantifies the short-time probability that an incident particle becomes adsorbed (for at least a vibrational period), whereas $p_{\\mathrm{inc}}$ quantifies the eventual probability that an incident particle becomes part of the crystal; in general $p_{\\mathrm{inc}}\\le s$, and $p_{\\mathrm{inc}}\\approx s$ when the mean residence time for desorption is much longer than the mean time to incorporation.**\nThis statement is a correct physical interpretation of the quantities and their relationship.\n- The description of $s$ and $p_{\\mathrm{inc}}$ matches their physical meaning in surface kinetics.\n- From our derived formula, since $k_{\\mathrm{inc}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{des}}$ are non-negative rate constants, the factor $\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{inc}}}{k_{\\mathrm{des}} + k_{\\mathrm{inc}}}$ must be between $0$ and $1$. Therefore, we must have $p_{\\mathrm{inc}} \\le s$.\n- The \"mean residence time for desorption\" is $\\tau_{\\mathrm{des}} = 1/k_{\\mathrm{des}}$. The \"mean time to incorporation\" is $\\tau_{\\mathrm{inc}} = 1/k_{\\mathrm{inc}}$. The condition $\\tau_{\\mathrm{des}} \\gg \\tau_{\\mathrm{inc}}$ implies $1/k_{\\mathrm{des}} \\gg 1/k_{\\mathrm{inc}}$, which is equivalent to $k_{\\mathrm{inc}} \\gg k_{\\mathrm{des}}$. In this limit, the denominator $k_{\\mathrm{des}} + k_{\\mathrm{inc}} \\approx k_{\\mathrm{inc}}$, and the fraction $\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{inc}}}{k_{\\mathrm{des}} + k_{\\mathrm{inc}}} \\approx \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{inc}}}{k_{\\mathrm{inc}}} = 1$. This leads to $p_{\\mathrm{inc}} \\approx s$. This analysis confirms the statement.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Increasing $T$ necessarily drives $p_{\\mathrm{inc}}$ closer to $s$ because higher $T$ increases $D$ and thus accelerates incorporation relative to desorption.**\nTo evaluate this, we must examine the temperature dependence of the ratio $k_{\\mathrm{inc}}/k_{\\mathrm{des}}$. Driving $p_{\\mathrm{inc}}$ closer to $s$ requires this ratio to increase.\nWe are given $k_{\\mathrm{des}} = \\nu_{\\mathrm{des}}\\exp(-E_{\\mathrm{des}}/k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)$ and $k_{\\mathrm{inc}} \\sim D/\\ell^{2} = (D_{0}/\\ell^{2})\\exp(-E_{\\mathrm{diff}}/k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)$.\nThe ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{inc}}}{k_{\\mathrm{des}}} \\propto \\frac{\\exp(-E_{\\mathrm{diff}}/k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)}{\\exp(-E_{\\mathrm{des}}/k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{des}} - E_{\\mathrm{diff}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right) $$\nIn most physical systems, the energy barrier for an adatom to desorb from the surface ($E_{\\mathrm{des}}$) is significantly larger than the barrier to diffuse across the surface ($E_{\\mathrm{diff}}$). Thus, $E_{\\mathrm{des}} - E_{\\mathrm{diff}} > 0$. As temperature $T$ increases, $1/T$ decreases, and the positive exponent $(E_{\\mathrm{des}} - E_{\\mathrm{diff}})/k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$ decreases. Consequently, the ratio $k_{\\mathrm{inc}}/k_{\\mathrm{des}}$ decreases. This means that increasing $T$ makes desorption *more* competitive with incorporation. The fraction $\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{inc}}}{k_{\\mathrm{des}} + k_{\\mathrm{inc}}}$ will decrease, moving $p_{\\mathrm{inc}}$ further *away* from $s$. The reasoning provided in the option is faulty as it ignores the strong temperature dependence of desorption.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. In a compound semiconductor grown under strongly group-III-limited conditions with a large group-V overpressure (e.g., GaAs with high arsenic flux), the group-III species typically exhibits $p_{\\mathrm{inc}}\\approx s$ because desorption before incorporation is negligible on the growth timescale.**\nThis describes a standard scenario in III-V semiconductor MBE. Group-III atoms (e.g., Ga) incident on a group-V-stabilized surface (e.g., As-rich GaAs) have a very high binding energy. This corresponds to a very large desorption activation energy, $E_{\\mathrm{des}}$, making the desorption rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{des}}$ extremely small at typical growth temperatures. The statement \"desorption before incorporation is negligible\" directly translates to the kinetic condition $k_{\\mathrm{des}} \\ll k_{\\mathrm{inc}}$. As established in the analysis of option B, under this condition, $p_{\\mathrm{inc}} \\approx s$. Often for Ga on GaAs, $s$ itself is close to $1$, so $p_{\\mathrm{inc}}$ is also close to $1$. The statement is physically correct and consistent with our model.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. When the diffusion length $\\lambda=\\sqrt{D/k_{\\mathrm{des}}}$ is much shorter than the mean step spacing $\\ell$, one typically finds $p_{\\mathrm{inc}}\\approx s$ because adatoms are trapped near their landing sites and thus cannot desorb efficiently.**\nThe diffusion length $\\lambda$ is the average distance an adatom travels before desorbing. The mean step spacing $\\ell$ is the typical distance an adatom must travel to be incorporated. The condition $\\lambda \\ll \\ell$ means an adatom is far more likely to desorb than to reach a step edge. Let us formalize this.\nThe condition is $\\sqrt{D/k_{\\mathrm{des}}} \\ll \\ell$. Squaring both sides yields $D/k_{\\mathrm{des}} \\ll \\ell^2$, which can be rearranged to $D/\\ell^2 \\ll k_{\\mathrm{des}}$. Using the given estimate $k_{\\mathrm{inc}} \\sim D/\\ell^2$, this condition is equivalent to $k_{\\mathrm{inc}} \\ll k_{\\mathrm{des}}$.\nIn this limit, our formula for $p_{\\mathrm{inc}}$ becomes:\n$$ p_{\\mathrm{inc}} = s \\left( \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{inc}}}{k_{\\mathrm{des}} + k_{\\mathrm{inc}}} \\right) \\approx s \\left( \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{inc}}}{k_{\\mathrm{des}}} \\right) $$\nSince $k_{\\mathrm{inc}}/k_{\\mathrm{des}} \\ll 1$, this implies $p_{\\mathrm{inc}} \\ll s$. This is the opposite of the option's claim ($p_{\\mathrm{inc}}\\approx s$). The physical reasoning is also flawed: if $\\lambda \\ll \\ell$, adatoms do not reach incorporation sites precisely because they desorb too efficiently.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Effective Sticking Probability $S_{\\mathrm{eff}}(\\theta)$\nThe overall effective sticking probability, $S_{\\mathrm{eff}}(\\theta)$, is the sum of the probabilities of all possible successful sticking events. Based on the problem description, an incoming molecule can stick to the surface via two mutually exclusive pathways:\n1.  **Immediate Sticking:** The molecule lands on an empty site and sticks directly.\n2.  **Precursor-Mediated Sticking:** The molecule does not stick immediately, but instead forms a mobile precursor (adatom) which then diffuses on the surface and finds an empty site before it desorbs.\n\nLet us denote the probability of the first pathway as $P_{\\mathrm{direct}}$ and the second as $P_{\\mathrm{precursor}}$. The total probability is their sum:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{eff}}(\\theta) = P_{\\mathrm{direct}} + P_{\\mathrm{precursor}}$$\n\n**1. Probability of Immediate Sticking ($P_{\\mathrm{direct}}$)**\nFor immediate sticking to occur, two conditions must be met:\n- The molecule must land on an unoccupied site. The probability of this is the fraction of the surface that is empty, which is $(1-\\theta)$.\n- Given that the molecule has landed on an empty site, it must stick. The probability for this is given as the microscopic sticking factor, $s_{0}$.\n\nThe combined probability is the product of these two independent probabilities:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{direct}} = s_0 (1-\\theta)$$\n\n**2. Probability of Precursor-Mediated Sticking ($P_{\\mathrm{precursor}}$)**\nThis pathway is a sequence of events. For a molecule to stick via this mechanism, it must:\n- (a) Not stick immediately.\n- (b) Thermally accommodate to become a mobile adatom.\n- (c) Find an empty site before desorbing.\n\nThe probability of not sticking immediately, $P_{\\mathrm{no\\_direct}}$, is the complement of sticking immediately:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{no\\_direct}} = 1 - P_{\\mathrm{direct}} = 1 - s_0 (1-\\theta)$$\nOf the molecules that do not stick immediately, a fraction $a$ accommodates. Thus, the probability of an incoming molecule forming a mobile precursor is:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{form\\_precursor}} = a \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{no\\_direct}} = a \\left[1 - s_0 (1-\\theta)\\right]$$\nNow, we must find the probability that this mobile adatom finds an empty site during its mean residence time $\\tau$. Let this be $P_{\\mathrm{find\\_site}}$. According to the problem's approximations, the adatom explores an area $A_{\\mathrm{explored}}$ which is a disk with a radius equal to the root-mean-square displacement $\\sqrt{\\langle r^2 \\rangle}$ of a 2D Brownian walker.\nFor two-dimensional diffusion, the mean-square displacement after a time $t$ is given by:\n$$\\langle r^2 \\rangle(t) = 4 D_s t$$\nOver the residence time $\\tau$, this becomes $\\langle r^2 \\rangle = 4 D_s \\tau$. The radius of the explored area is $r_{\\mathrm{rms}} = \\sqrt{4 D_s \\tau}$.\nThe area explored is therefore:\n$$A_{\\mathrm{explored}} = \\pi r_{\\mathrm{rms}}^2 = \\pi (4 D_s \\tau) = 4 \\pi D_s \\tau$$\nThe empty sites are modeled as a spatial Poisson process with an intensity (density) of $\\lambda = N_s (1-\\theta)$. For a 2D Poisson process, the probability of finding zero events in an area $A$ is $P(k=0) = \\exp(-\\lambda A)$. The probability of finding at least one site, which means the adatom successfully sticks, is the complement of finding zero sites:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{find\\_site}} = 1 - P(k=0) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda A_{\\mathrm{explored}})$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\lambda$ and $A_{\\mathrm{explored}}$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{find\\_site}} = 1 - \\exp\\left[ -N_s (1-\\theta) \\cdot (4 \\pi D_s \\tau) \\right] = 1 - \\exp\\left[ -4 \\pi N_s D_s \\tau (1-\\theta) \\right]$$\nThe total probability for the precursor-mediated pathway is the product of the probability of forming a precursor and the probability of that precursor finding a site:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{precursor}} = P_{\\mathrm{form\\_precursor}} \\times P_{\\mathrm{find\\_site}}$$\n$$P_{\\mathrm{precursor}} = a \\left[1 - s_0 (1-\\theta)\\right] \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left[ -4 \\pi N_s D_s \\tau (1-\\theta) \\right] \\right)$$\n\n**3.

The slip velocity is $u_s = u(y=0)$. For a stationary wall, $u_w = 0$, so $u_{\\text{slip}} = u_s$.\n\nA fundamental concept in the kinetic theory of slip flow is that molecules colliding with the wall have, on average, traveled a distance on the order of one mean free path, $\\lambda$, since their last intermolecular collision. Therefore, the average tangential velocity of molecules incident on the wall, $u_{\\text{inc}}$, can be approximated by the bulk gas velocity at $y=\\lambda$. Using a first-order Taylor series expansion of the velocity profile $u(y)$ around the wall at $y=0$, we have:\n$$u_{\\text{inc}} \\approx u(\\lambda) = u(0) + \\lambda \\left.\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right|_{y=0} = u_s + \\lambda \\left.\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right|_w$$\n\nNext, we model the average tangential velocity of molecules reflecting from the wall, $u_{\\text{ref}}$. According to the Maxwell model:\n- A fraction $\\sigma_v$ of molecules reflect diffusely. These molecules fully accommodate to the wall and are re-emitted with the wall's tangential velocity, $u_w$.\n- A fraction $1 - \\sigma_v$ of molecules reflect specularly. These molecules conserve their tangential velocity, so their post-collision tangential velocity is the same as their pre-collision velocity, $u_{\\text{inc}}$.\nThe average velocity of the reflected molecules is the weighted average of these two outcomes:\n$$u_{\\text{ref}} = \\sigma_v u_w + (1 - \\sigma_v) u_{\\text{inc}}$$\n\nThe gas velocity at the wall, $u_s$, represents the average velocity of all molecules (both incident and reflected) in the infinitesimally thin layer at $y=0$. Assuming equal number fluxes for incident and reflected molecules, $u_s$ is the arithmetic mean of $u_{\\text{inc}}$ and $u_{\\text{ref}}$:\n$$u_s = \\frac{1}{2} (u_{\\text{inc}} + u_{\\text{ref}})$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $u_{\\text{ref}}$ into this equation gives:\n$$u_s = \\frac{1}{2} (u_{\\text{inc}} + [\\sigma_v u_w + (1 - \\sigma_v) u_{\\text{inc}}])$$\n$$u_s = \\frac{1}{2} (2 - \\sigma_v) u_{\\text{inc}} + \\frac{\\sigma_v}{2} u_w$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for $u_{\\text{inc}}$ into the above equation:\n$$u_s = \\frac{2 - \\sigma_v}{2} \\left( u_s + \\lambda \\left.\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right|_w \\right) + \\frac{\\sigma_v}{2} u_w$$\n\nTo find the slip velocity $u_{\\text{slip}} = u_s - u_w$, we rearrange the equation to solve for $u_s$:\n$$u_s - \\frac{2 - \\sigma_v}{2} u_s = \\frac{2 - \\sigma_v}{2} \\lambda \\left.\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right|_w + \\frac{\\sigma_v}{2} u_w$$\n$$u_s \\left(1 - \\frac{2 - \\sigma_v}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2 - \\sigma_v}{2} \\lambda \\left.\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right|_w + \\frac{\\sigma_v}{2} u_w$$\n$$u_s \\left(\\frac{2 - (2 - \\sigma_v)}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2 - \\sigma_v}{2} \\lambda \\left.\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right|_w + \\frac{\\sigma_v}{2} u_w$$\n$$u_s \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_v}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2 - \\sigma_v}{2} \\lambda \\left.\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right|_w + \\frac{\\sigma_v}{2} u_w$$\nMultiplying both sides by $\\frac{2}{\\sigma_v}$ isolates $u_s$:\n$$u_s = \\frac{2 - \\sigma_v}{\\sigma_v} \\lambda \\left.\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right|_w + u_w$$\n\nFrom this, we obtain the derived first-order velocity slip boundary condition for the slip velocity, $u_{\\text{slip}} = u_s - u_w$:\n$$u_{\\text{slip}} = \\frac{2 - \\sigma_v}{\\sigma_v} \\lambda \\left.\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right|_w$$\n\nNow, we can compute the numerical value of $u_{\\text{slip}}$ using the data provided in the problem statement:\n- Sticking probability (TMAC) $\\sigma_{v} = 0.80$.\n- Mean free path $\\lambda = 3.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n- Near-wall tangential velocity gradient $\\left.\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right|_{w} = 1.0 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$u_{\\text{slip}} = \\frac{2 - 0.80}{0.80} \\times (3.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})$$\n$$u_{\\text{slip}} = \\frac{1.20}{0.80} \\times (3.0 \\times 10^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{m/s})$$\n$$u_{\\text{slip}} = 1.5 \\times 0.30\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$$\n$$u_{\\text{slip}} = 0.45\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$u_{\\text{slip}} = 0.450\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$$\nThis is the magnitude of the tangential velocity slip at the wall.",
