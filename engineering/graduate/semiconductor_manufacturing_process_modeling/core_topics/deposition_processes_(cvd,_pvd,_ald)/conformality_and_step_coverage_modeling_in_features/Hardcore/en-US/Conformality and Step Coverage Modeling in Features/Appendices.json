A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution requires calculating the deposition rate on the sidewall from the isotropic flux component and normalizing it by the total deposition rate on an open surface.\n\nFirst, let us relate the intensity of the isotropic flux component to the given parameters. Let $I_{\\mathrm{iso}}$ be the isotropic intensity, defined as the particle flux per unit solid angle (particles per area per time per steradian). The deposition rate on a horizontal surface due to this isotropic flux, $J_{\\mathrm{open,iso}}$, is found by integrating the contribution from all incoming directions over the hemisphere above the surface. The contribution from a differential solid angle $d\\Omega$ at a polar angle $\\theta$ from the surface normal is $I_{\\mathrm{iso}} \\cos\\theta d\\Omega$.\nThe solid angle element is $d\\Omega = \\sin\\theta d\\theta d\\phi$, where $\\phi$ is the azimuthal angle.\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{open,iso}} = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} I_{\\mathrm{iso}} \\cos\\theta \\sin\\theta d\\theta\n$$\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{open,iso}} = 2\\pi I_{\\mathrm{iso}} \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta d\\theta = 2\\pi I_{\\mathrm{iso}} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}\\sin^2\\theta \\right]_{0}^{\\pi/2} = \\pi I_{\\mathrm{iso}}\n$$\nFrom the problem statement, this isotropic component constitutes a fraction $\\beta$ of the total deposition rate $J_{\\mathrm{open}}$.\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{open,iso}} = \\beta J_{\\mathrm{open}}\n$$\nTherefore, we can express the isotropic intensity as:\n$$\n\\pi I_{\\mathrm{iso}} = \\beta J_{\\mathrm{open}} \\implies I_{\\mathrm{iso}} = \\frac{\\beta J_{\\mathrm{open}}}{\\pi}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the deposition rate on the vertical sidewall at a depth $d$, denoted $J_{\\mathrm{wall,iso}}(d)$. Consider a point $P$ on the sidewall at depth $d$. Let's set up a coordinate system where $P$ is at the origin $(0,0,0)$. The sidewall lies in the $y-z$ plane, and its normal vector is $\\vec{n} = (1,0,0)$. The trench opening is an infinite strip defined by $z=d$, $0 < x < w$, and $-\\infty < y < \\infty$.\n\nThe deposition rate at $P$ is the integral of the normal component of the incident flux over the solid angle $\\Omega_P$ through which $P$ can see the opening. Let an incident direction be specified by a vector $\\vec{u}$. The rate is $J_{\\mathrm{wall,iso}}(d) = \\int_{\\Omega_P} I_{\\mathrm{iso}} (\\vec{u} \\cdot \\vec{n}) d\\Omega$.\nLet's use spherical coordinates $(\\alpha, \\psi)$ centered at $P$, where $\\alpha$ is the polar angle from the wall normal (the $x$-axis) and $\\psi$ is the azimuthal angle. The direction vector is $\\vec{u} = (\\cos\\alpha, \\sin\\alpha\\cos\\psi, \\sin\\alpha\\sin\\psi)$. The normal component is $\\vec{u} \\cdot \\vec{n} = \\cos\\alpha$. The solid angle element is $d\\Omega = \\sin\\alpha d\\alpha d\\psi$.\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{wall,iso}}(d) = \\iint_{\\Omega_P} I_{\\mathrm{iso}} \\cos\\alpha \\sin\\alpha d\\alpha d\\psi\n$$\nThe integration limits for $\\alpha$ and $\\psi$ are determined by the geometry of the trench opening. A ray from $P$ in direction $(\\alpha, \\psi)$ must pass through the opening. The ray's coordinates are $(r\\cos\\alpha, r\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\psi, r\\sin\\alpha\\sin\\psi)$. To intersect the opening, we must have $z=d$ and $0 < x < w$ for some $r>0$.\n1.  $r\\sin\\alpha\\sin\\psi = d \\implies r = \\frac{d}{\\sin\\alpha\\sin\\psi}$. This requires $\\sin\\psi > 0$, so $\\psi \\in (0, \\pi)$.\n2.  $x = r\\cos\\alpha = \\frac{d\\cos\\alpha}{\\sin\\alpha\\sin\\psi} < w$. This gives $\\cot\\alpha < \\frac{w}{d}\\sin\\psi$. Since $\\alpha \\in [0, \\pi/2]$ for the ray to go into the trench, the lower limit for $\\alpha$ is $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\arccot\\left(\\frac{w}{d}\\sin\\psi\\right)$ and the upper limit is $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\pi/2$.\n\nThe integral becomes:\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{wall,iso}}(d) = I_{\\mathrm{iso}} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\left[ \\int_{\\arccot(\\frac{w}{d}\\sin\\psi)}^{\\pi/2} \\cos\\alpha\\sin\\alpha d\\alpha \\right] d\\psi\n$$\nThe inner integral is:\n$$\n\\int \\cos\\alpha\\sin\\alpha d\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}\\sin^2\\alpha\n$$\n$$\n\\left[ \\frac{1}{2}\\sin^2\\alpha \\right]_{\\arccot(\\frac{w}{d}\\sin\\psi)}^{\\pi/2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) - \\sin^2\\left(\\arccot\\left(\\frac{w}{d}\\sin\\psi\\right)\\right) \\right)\n$$\nUsing the identity $\\sin^2(\\arccot(u)) = \\frac{1}{1+u^2}$, the result is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{w}{d}\\sin\\psi\\right)^2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\left(\\frac{w}{d}\\sin\\psi\\right)^2}{1 + \\left(\\frac{w}{d}\\sin\\psi\\right)^2}\n$$\nNow, we perform the outer integral over $\\psi$. Let $A = w/d$.\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{wall,iso}}(d) = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{iso}}}{2} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\frac{A^2\\sin^2\\psi}{1+A^2\\sin^2\\psi} d\\psi = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{iso}}}{2} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{1+A^2\\sin^2\\psi}\\right) d\\psi\n$$\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{wall,iso}}(d) = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{iso}}}{2} \\left( \\pi - \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\frac{1}{1+A^2\\sin^2\\psi}d\\psi \\right)\n$$\nThe remaining integral can be solved using a standard result or by substitution ($t=\\tan(\\psi/2)$ or by converting to $\\sec^2\\psi$):\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\frac{d\\psi}{1+A^2\\sin^2\\psi} = 2 \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} \\frac{d\\psi}{1+A^2\\sin^2\\psi} = 2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{dt}{1+t^2+A^2t^2} = 2\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\frac{dt}{1+(1+A^2)t^2}\n$$\nwhere we used $t=\\tan(\\psi)$. This evaluates to $\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{1+A^2}}$.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\frac{d\\psi}{1+A^2\\sin^2\\psi} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{1+(w/d)^2}} = \\frac{\\pi d}{\\sqrt{d^2+w^2}}\n$$\nSubstituting this back:\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{wall,iso}}(d) = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{iso}}}{2} \\left( \\pi - \\frac{\\pi d}{\\sqrt{d^2+w^2}} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi I_{\\mathrm{iso}}}{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{d}{\\sqrt{d^2+w^2}} \\right)\n$$\nNow, substitute $I_{\\mathrm{iso}} = \\beta J_{\\mathrm{open}}/\\pi$:\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{wall,iso}}(d) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\beta J_{\\mathrm{open}}}{\\pi} \\right) \\left( 1 - \\frac{d}{\\sqrt{d^2+w^2}} \\right) = \\frac{\\beta J_{\\mathrm{open}}}{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{d}{\\sqrt{d^2+w^2}} \\right)\n$$\nThe step coverage is defined as $S_{\\mathrm{iso}}(d) = J_{\\mathrm{wall,iso}}(d) / J_{\\mathrm{open}}$.\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{iso}}(d) = \\frac{\\beta}{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{d}{\\sqrt{d^2+w^2}} \\right)\n$$\nFinally, we evaluate this expression at the mid-depth of the trench, $d = h/2$.\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{iso}}\\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\beta}{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{h/2}{\\sqrt{(h/2)^2+w^2}} \\right)\n$$\nSimplifying the term in the parenthesis:\n$$\n\\frac{h/2}{\\sqrt{h^2/4+w^2}} = \\frac{h/2}{\\sqrt{\\frac{h^2+4w^2}{4}}} = \\frac{h/2}{\\frac{\\sqrt{h^2+4w^2}}{2}} = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{h^2+4w^2}}\n$$\nThus, the final expression for the step coverage at mid-depth is:\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{iso}}\\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\beta}{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{h^2+4w^2}} \\right)\n$$",

It presents a scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective scenario for modeling surface kinetics during Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) within a microfeature. All necessary parameters and initial conditions are provided to derive and solve the governing equation for surface coverage.\n\nThe first step is to derive the governing differential equation for the fractional surface coverage, $\\theta(y,t)$. The quantity of interest is the number of occupied reactive sites per unit area, which is given by the product of the total site density, $\\Gamma$, and the fractional coverage, $\\theta(y,t)$. The rate of change of this quantity must equal the net rate of precursor adsorption.\n\nThe rate of change of occupied sites per unit area at a fixed position $y$ is:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} (\\Gamma \\, \\theta(y,t)) = \\Gamma \\frac{\\partial \\theta(y,t)}{\\partial t} $$\nThis rate is the difference between the adsorption rate, $r_{\\mathrm{ads}}(y,t)$, and the desorption rate, $r_{\\mathrm{des}}(y,t)$.\n$$ \\Gamma \\frac{\\partial \\theta(y,t)}{\\partial t} = r_{\\mathrm{ads}}(y,t) - r_{\\mathrm{des}}(y,t) $$\nSubstituting the given expressions for the rates:\n$$ \\Gamma \\frac{\\partial \\theta(y,t)}{\\partial t} = k_{\\mathrm{ads}}\\,c(y)\\,\\Gamma\\,(1-\\theta(y,t)) - k_{\\mathrm{des}}\\,\\Gamma\\,\\theta(y,t) $$\nThe site density $\\Gamma$ is a non-zero constant and can be canceled from each term, yielding the governing equation for $\\theta(y,t)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\theta(y,t)}{\\partial t} = k_{\\mathrm{ads}}\\,c(y)\\,(1-\\theta(y,t)) - k_{\\mathrm{des}}\\,\\theta(y,t) $$\nThis is a partial differential equation.

Use the following test suite of physically reasonable parameter sets (all lengths in nanometers, time in seconds, curvature in inverse nanometers, and speeds in nanometers per second):\n\n- Test Case 1 (general case):\n  - $\\Gamma = 0.6$ $\\mathrm{nm}$ per unit flux, $J = 1.0$ per second (so base rate $A = \\Gamma J = 0.6$ $\\mathrm{nm/s}$),\n  - $\\ell = 5$ $\\mathrm{nm}$,\n  - $R_{\\text{top}} = 50$ $\\mathrm{nm}$, $R_{\\text{bottom}} = 50$ $\\mathrm{nm}$,\n  - $t = 10$ $\\mathrm{s}$.\n\n- Test Case 2 (sharp corners):\n  - $\\Gamma = 1.0$ $\\mathrm{nm}$ per unit flux, $J = 1.0$ per second ($A = 1.0$ $\\mathrm{nm/s}$),\n  - $\\ell = 2$ $\\mathrm{nm}$,\n  - $R_{\\text{top}} = 5$ $\\mathrm{nm}$, $R_{\\text{bottom}} = 5$ $\\mathrm{nm}$,\n  - $t = 4$ $\\mathrm{s}$.\n\n- Test Case 3 (strong concave curvature reduction):\n  - $\\Gamma = 0.5$ $\\mathrm{nm}$ per unit flux, $J = 1.0$ per second ($A = 0.5$ $\\mathrm{nm/s}$),\n  - $\\ell = 18$ $\\mathrm{nm}$,\n  - $R_{\\text{top}} = 20$ $\\mathrm{nm}$, $R_{\\text{bottom}} = 20$ $\\mathrm{nm}$,\n  - $t = 5$ $\\mathrm{s}$.\n\n- Test Case 4 (no curvature effect baseline):\n  - $\\Gamma = 0.75$ $\\mathrm{nm}$ per unit flux, $J = 1.0$ per second ($A = 0.75$ $\\mathrm{nm/s}$),\n  - $\\ell = 0$ $\\mathrm{nm}$,\n  - $R_{\\text{top}} = 10$ $\\mathrm{nm}$, $R_{\\text{bottom}} = 10$ $\\mathrm{nm}$,\n  - $t = 8$ $\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nFor each test case, compute and return the pair $\\left[r_{\\text{bottom}}, r_{\\text{top}}\\right]$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, with each test case represented as a two-element list in the order specified. For example, the output format must be like:\n\"[[r_{b1},r_{t1}],[r_{b2},r_{t2}],[r_{b3},r_{t3}],[r_{b4},r_{t4}]]\".",
            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and internally consistent. It presents a standard, albeit simplified, model for surface evolution in thin-film deposition, a topic of central importance in semiconductor process modeling. The premises are based on established geometric principles (parallel curves) and physical approximations (linear dependence of growth rate on curvature). All necessary parameters and constraints for a unique solution are provided. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution is developed in four stages as per the problem tasks:\n1.  Derivation of the curvature-dependent normal velocity, $V_n$.\n2.  Formulation of the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) for film thickness, $s(t)$.\n3.  Integration of the ODE to find an implicit equation for $s(t)$.\n4.  Description of the numerical algorithm to solve for $s(t)$ and compute the required conformality metrics.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Normal Velocity $V_n$**\n\nThe problem states that the local normal growth speed $V_n$ consists of a base speed proportional to the incoming flux $J$, plus a first-order correction term that is linear in the local curvature $\\kappa$.\n\nThe base speed, let's call it $A$, is related to the flux $J$ by a kinetic factor $\\Gamma$. The units of $\\Gamma$ are given as nanometers per unit flux (e.g., $\\mathrm{nm} / (\\mathrm{particles} \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^{-2} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1})$), and $J$ has units of flux (e.g., $\\mathrm{particles} \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^{-2} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$). To obtain a speed in $\\mathrm{nm/s}$, the dimensionally consistent form for the base speed is:\n$$\nA = \\Gamma J.\n$$\nThe correction to the speed must be linear in curvature $\\kappa$ (units: $\\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$) and involve the characteristic length scale $\\ell$ (units: $\\mathrm{nm}$). To maintain dimensional consistency—that is, the correction term must also have units of speed ($\\mathrm{nm/s}$)—the most direct formulation involves multiplying the base speed $A$ by a dimensionless factor proportional to $\\kappa$. The dimensionless group formed from $\\ell$ and $\\kappa$ is $(\\ell \\kappa)$.\n\nThus, the total normal velocity $V_n$ can be expressed as:\n$$\nV_n(\\kappa) = A (1 + \\ell \\kappa).\n$$\nThis form is the simplest that satisfies the linear-in-curvature requirement and dimensional consistency. The sign convention is also consistent with physical expectations:\n- For a convex corner (e.g., top of a trench), $\\kappa > 0$. The speed becomes $V_n = A(1 + \\ell\\kappa) > A$, indicating enhanced growth.\n- For a concave corner (e.g., bottom of a trench), $\\kappa < 0$. The speed becomes $V_n = A(1 - \\ell|\\kappa|) < A$, indicating reduced growth, often due to geometric shadowing effects. The problem's constraint $1 + \\kappa_0 \\ell > 0$ ensures the initial velocity is positive, preventing non-physical etching at the start of the process.\n\n**2. Formulation of the Governing ODE for Film Thickness $s(t)$**\n\nThe evolution of the film is determined by the local normal kinematics, given by $ds/dt = V_n$, where $s(t)$ is the local film thickness grown normal to the initial surface after time $t$. The curvature $\\kappa$ is not constant but evolves as the surface grows. For an initial surface with a circular arc of curvature $\\kappa_0$, the curvature of the parallel curve at a normal distance $s$ is given by:\n$$\n\\kappa(s) = \\frac{\\kappa_0}{1 + \\kappa_0 s}.\n$$\nSubstituting this into our expression for $V_n$, we get the speed as a function of thickness $s$:\n$$\nV_n(s) = A \\left(1 + \\ell \\frac{\\kappa_0}{1 + \\kappa_0 s}\\right).\n$$\nCombining terms, we obtain:\n$$\nV_n(s) = A \\left(\\frac{1 + \\kappa_0 s + \\ell \\kappa_0}{1 + \\kappa_0 s}\\right) = A \\left(\\frac{1 + \\kappa_0(s + \\ell)}{1 + \\kappa_0 s}\\right).\n$$\nThe governing ODE for the film thickness $s(t)$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{ds}{dt} = A \\left(\\frac{1 + \\kappa_0(s + \\ell)}{1 + \\kappa_0 s}\\right),\n$$\nwith the initial condition $s(0) = 0$.\n\n**3. Integration and The Implicit Solution**\n\nThe derived ODE is a first-order, autonomous, separable differential equation. We can separate variables to solve it:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{1 + \\kappa_0 s}{1 + \\kappa_0(s + \\ell)}\\right) ds = A \\, dt.\n$$\nWe integrate both sides from the initial state $(s=0, t=0)$ to a general state $(s(t), t)$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{s(t)} \\left(\\frac{1 + \\kappa_0 u}{1 + \\kappa_0 \\ell + \\kappa_0 u}\\right) du = \\int_{0}^{t} A \\, d\\tau.\n$$\nThe right-hand side is simply $At$. For the left-hand side integral, we rewrite the integrand using algebraic manipulation:\n$$\n\\frac{1 + \\kappa_0 u}{1 + \\kappa_0 \\ell + \\kappa_0 u} = \\frac{(1 + \\kappa_0 \\ell + \\kappa_0 u) - \\kappa_0 \\ell}{1 + \\kappa_0 \\ell + \\kappa_0 u} = 1 - \\frac{\\kappa_0 \\ell}{1 + \\kappa_0 \\ell + \\kappa_0 u}.\n$$\nThe integral becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{s} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\kappa_0 \\ell}{1 + \\kappa_0 \\ell + \\kappa_0 u}\\right) du = \\left[ u - \\ell \\ln(1 + \\kappa_0 \\ell + \\kappa_0 u) \\right]_0^s.\n$$\nHere, we used the standard integral $\\int \\frac{k}{a+ku} du = \\ln(a+ku)$. The term $(1 + \\kappa_0 \\ell + \\kappa_0 u)$ is guaranteed to be positive by the problem constraints ($1+\\kappa_0 \\ell > 0$ and $s$ being smaller than the radius of curvature for concave corners), so the absolute value in the logarithm is not needed.\n\nEvaluating the definite integral:\n$$\n\\left( s - \\ell \\ln(1 + \\kappa_0(s + \\ell)) \\right) - \\left( 0 - \\ell \\ln(1 + \\kappa_0 \\ell) \\right) = s - \\ell \\left( \\ln(1 + \\kappa_0(s + \\ell)) - \\ln(1 + \\kappa_0 \\ell) \\right).\n$$\nThis simplifies using logarithm properties to:\n$$\ns - \\ell \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 + \\kappa_0(s + \\ell)}{1 + \\kappa_0 \\ell}\\right).\n$$\nEquating this to the right-hand side integral, we obtain the implicit relationship between $s$ and $t$:\n$$\nA t = s - \\ell \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 + \\kappa_0(s + \\ell)}{1 + \\kappa_0 \\ell}\\right).\n$$\nSpecial cases:\n- If $\\kappa_0 = 0$ (planar surface), the ODE simplifies to $ds/dt = A$, yielding $s(t) = At$.\n- If $\\ell = 0$ (no curvature dependence), the logarithmic term vanishes, and we again get $s(t) = At$, meaning deposition is perfectly conformal.\n\n**4. Algorithm for Numerical Solution and Metric Calculation**\n\nTo find the thickness $s$ for a given time $t$, we must numerically solve the implicit equation. We define a function $f(s)$ whose root is the desired thickness:\n$$\nf(s) = s - \\ell \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 + \\kappa_0(s + \\ell)}{1 + \\kappa_0 \\ell}\\right) - At = 0.\n$$\nThe derivative of this function with respect to $s$ is $f'(s) = (1 + \\kappa_0 s) / (1 + \\kappa_0(s + \\ell))$, which is always positive under the given physical constraints. This guarantees that $f(s)$ is strictly monotonic, making it ideal for a root-finding algorithm like bisection.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  **Input**: Time $t$, initial curvature $\\kappa_0$, base rate $A = \\Gamma J$, and characteristic length $\\ell$.\n2.  **Handle special cases**: If $\\ell=0$ or $\\kappa_0=0$, return $s = At$.\n3.  **Numerical solution (Bisection Method)**:\n    a. Define the function $f(s)$ as above.\n    b. Establish a search bracket $[s_{\\text{low}}, s_{\\text{high}}]$. Since $f(0) = -At < 0$, we can set $s_{\\text{low}} = 0$.\n    c. For the upper bound $s_{\\text{high}}$:\n        - If $\\kappa_0 > 0$ (convex), growth is accelerated. We can start with a guess like $s_{\\text{high}} = 2At$ and expand the interval (e.g., by doubling) until $f(s_{\\text{high}}) > 0$.\n        - If $\\kappa_0 < 0$ (concave), growth is retarded. The thickness $s$ is physically bounded by the condition that the offset curve does not self-intersect, which implies $1 + \\kappa_0(s+\\ell) > 0$. This gives an upper limit $s < 1/|\\kappa_0| - \\ell$. We set $s_{\\text{high}} = 1/|\\kappa_0| - \\ell$. As $s$ approaches this limit, $f(s) \\to \\infty$, so this provides a valid upper bound for the root.\n    d. Repeatedly bisect the interval $[s_{\\text{low}}, s_{\\text{high}}]$ for a sufficient number of iterations (e.g., $100$) to achieve high precision, updating the bounds based on the sign of $f(s_{\\text{mid}})$.\n    e. Return the final midpoint as the solution for $s(t)$.\n\n4.  **Metric Calculation**:\n    a. Calculate the field thickness: $s_{\\text{field}}(t) = s(t, \\kappa_0=0, A, \\ell) = At$.\n    b. Calculate top corner thickness: $s_{\\text{top}}(t) = s(t, \\kappa_0=1/R_{\\text{top}}, A, \\ell)$.\n    c. Calculate bottom corner thickness: $s_{\\text{bottom}}(t) = s(t, \\kappa_0=-1/R_{\\text{bottom}}, A, \\ell)$.\n    d. Compute the ratios: $r_{\\text{bottom}} = s_{\\text{bottom}}(t) / s_{\\text{field}}(t)$ and $r_{\\text{top}} = s_{\\text{top}}(t) / s_{\\text{field}}(t)$.\n\nThis procedure is implemented for each test case provided in the problem.",
