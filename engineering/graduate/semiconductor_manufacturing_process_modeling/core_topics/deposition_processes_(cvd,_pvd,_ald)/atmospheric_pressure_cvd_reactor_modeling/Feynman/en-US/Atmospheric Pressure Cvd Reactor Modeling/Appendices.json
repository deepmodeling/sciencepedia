It is deemed **valid**.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe primary objective is to derive an expression for the mean free path, $\\lambda$, and subsequently calculate the Knudsen number, $Kn$.\n\nThe mean free path, $\\lambda$, is defined as the average distance a molecule travels between successive collisions. It can be expressed as the ratio of the mean molecular speed, $\\langle v \\rangle$, to the collision frequency, $\\nu$.\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{\\langle v \\rangle}{\\nu}\n$$\n\nThe collision frequency, $\\nu$, for a single molecule moving through a gas of other molecules must account for the relative motion of all particles. For a gas composed of identical hard-sphere molecules, a rigorous derivation from kinetic theory shows that the collision frequency is given by:\n$$\n\\nu = n \\sigma \\langle v_{rel} \\rangle\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the number density of molecules (number of molecules per unit volume), $\\sigma$ is the collision cross-section, and $\\langle v_{rel} \\rangle$ is the mean relative speed between molecules. For a gas in thermal equilibrium, the mean relative speed is related to the mean speed of a single molecule by $\\langle v_{rel} \\rangle = \\sqrt{2} \\langle v \\rangle$.\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for collision frequency gives:\n$$\n\\nu = \\sqrt{2} n \\sigma \\langle v \\rangle\n$$\n\nNow, we can find the expression for the mean free path:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{\\langle v \\rangle}{\\nu} = \\frac{\\langle v \\rangle}{\\sqrt{2} n \\sigma \\langle v \\rangle} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} n \\sigma}\n$$\n\nThe collision cross-section, $\\sigma$, for two identical hard spheres of diameter $d$ is the area of a circle of radius $d$. This is because a collision occurs if the center of one molecule comes within a distance $d$ of the center of another molecule.\n$$\n\\sigma = \\pi d^2\n$$\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\lambda$ yields:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} n \\pi d^2}\n$$\n\nThe next step is to express the number density, $n$, in terms of the macroscopic properties of the gas: pressure $p$ and temperature $T$. As stipulated, we use the Ideal Gas Law:\n$$\npV = N k_B T\n$$\nwhere $N$ is the total number of molecules in a volume $V$, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. The number density $n$ is defined as $n = N/V$. Rearranging the Ideal Gas Law gives:\n$$\nn = \\frac{N}{V} = \\frac{p}{k_B T}\n$$\n\nFinally, substituting this expression for $n$ into our equation for $\\lambda$ gives the desired relationship. This completes the first part of the problem.\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} \\left(\\frac{p}{k_B T}\\right) \\pi d^2} = \\frac{k_B T}{\\sqrt{2} \\pi d^2 p}\n$$\n\n### Numerical Calculation\n\nNow we proceed to the numerical evaluation using the provided data:\n-   $k_{B} = 1.380\\,649\\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J/K}$\n-   $T = 1000\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n-   $d = 4.0\\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n-   $p = 1.01325\\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$\n-   $L = 1.0\\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the mean free path $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{(1.380\\,649\\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J/K}) (1000\\ \\mathrm{K})}{\\sqrt{2} \\pi (4.0\\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{m})^2 (1.01325\\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{Pa})}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{1.380\\,649\\times 10^{-20}}{\\sqrt{2} \\pi (1.6\\times 10^{-19}) (1.01325\\times 10^{5})} \\ \\mathrm{m}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{1.380\\,649\\times 10^{-20}}{7.20227\\times 10^{-14}} \\ \\mathrm{m} \\approx 1.91696\\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m}\n$$\nNext, we compute the Knudsen number $Kn$ using its definition, $Kn=\\lambda/L$:\n$$\nKn = \\frac{\\lambda}{L} = \\frac{1.91696\\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m}}{1.0\\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m}}\n$$\n$$\nKn = 1.91696\\times 10^{-5}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nKn \\approx 1.92\\times 10^{-5}\n$$\nThis value is dimensionless, as expected for the Knudsen number, which is a ratio of two lengths.

All necessary parameters and conditions for a unique solution are provided, and they are physically consistent and realistic within the context of chemical vapor deposition modeling.\n\nThe physical process is the one-dimensional convective transport of a species B in a non-isothermal flow. The governing equation for the mole fraction of species B, $x_B$, can be derived from the species conservation equation. In one dimension, the general form is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C_B}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial N_{B,z}}{\\partial z} = R_B\n$$\nwhere $C_B$ is the molar concentration of species B, $t$ is time, $z$ is the axial coordinate, $N_{B,z}$ is the axial molar flux of B, and $R_B$ is the molar rate of production of B.\n\nThe problem states that the precursor is a passive scalar, meaning there are no gas-phase or surface reactions, so $R_B = 0$. It also specifies that diffusive and dispersive transport are negligible. Therefore, the flux is purely convective:\n$$\nN_{B,z} = C_B v(z)\n$$\nwhere $v(z)$ is the axial gas velocity, which may vary with position $z$. The conservation equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C_B}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial (C_B v(z))}{\\partial z} = 0\n$$\nThe molar concentration of species B is related to its mole fraction $x_B$ and the total molar concentration $C(z)$ by $C_B = x_B C(z)$. Substituting this gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial (x_B C(z))}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial (x_B C(z) v(z))}{\\partial z} = 0\n$$\nSince the temperature profile $T(z)$ and pressure $p$ are independent of time, the total concentration $C(z) = \\frac{p}{RT(z)}$ is also independent of time. The first term becomes $C(z) \\frac{\\partial x_B}{\\partial t}$.\n\nThe term $C(z)v(z)$ represents the total molar flux, $N_z = \\frac{\\dot{n}}{A}$, where $\\dot{n}$ is the total molar flow rate and $A$ is the cross-sectional area. The problem states that $\\dot{n}$ and $A$ are constant, so the total molar flux $N_z$ is constant along the reactor length.\nThe conservation equation simplifies to:\n$$\nC(z)\\frac{\\partial x_B}{\\partial t} + N_z \\frac{\\partial x_B}{\\partial z} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{p}{RT(z)}\\frac{\\partial x_B}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\dot{n}}{A} \\frac{\\partial x_B}{\\partial z} = 0\n$$\nRearranging to isolate the time derivative gives the required one-dimensional convective transport model for the mole fraction:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial x_B}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\dot{n}RT(z)}{pA} \\frac{\\partial x_B}{\\partial z} = 0\n$$\nThis is the pure advection equation, $\\frac{\\partial x_B}{\\partial t} + v(z) \\frac{\\partial x_B}{\\partial z} = 0$, where the advection velocity is the local gas velocity $v(z)$:\n$$\nv(z) = \\frac{\\dot{n}RT(z)}{pA}\n$$\nThe problem specifies a linear temperature profile:\n$$\nT(z) = T_0 + (T_L - T_0)\\frac{z}{L}\n$$\nwhere $T_0 = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$ is the temperature at the inlet ($z=0$) and $T_L = 1000\\,\\mathrm{K}$ is the temperature at the outlet ($z=L=0.50\\,\\mathrm{m}$).\n\nThe equation $\\frac{\\partial x_B}{\\partial t} + v(z) \\frac{\\partial x_B}{\\partial z} = 0$ implies that the mole fraction $x_B$ is constant along characteristic curves defined by $\\frac{dz}{dt} = v(z)$. The arrival time $t_f$ of the composition front (the center of the advected step) at the wafer location $z=L$ is the time it takes for a fluid element that enters the reactor at $t=0$ to travel the full length $L$.\nThis time can be found by separating variables and integrating:\n$$\ndt = \\frac{dz}{v(z)}\n$$\n$$\nt_f = \\int_0^{t_f} dt = \\int_0^L \\frac{dz}{v(z)}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $v(z)$ and $T(z)$:\n$$\nt_f = \\int_0^L \\frac{pA}{\\dot{n}RT(z)} dz = \\frac{pA}{\\dot{n}R} \\int_0^L \\frac{dz}{T_0 + (T_L - T_0)\\frac{z}{L}}\n$$\nTo evaluate the integral, let $u = T_0 + (T_L - T_0)\\frac{z}{L}$.

First, we eliminate $J^{\\star}$ by subtracting the equations pairwise:\nSubtracting equation (2) from (1):\n$$J_{1} - J_{2} = (J^{\\star} + C h_{1}^{p}) - (J^{\\star} + C h_{2}^{p}) = C (h_{1}^{p} - h_{2}^{p})$$\nSubtracting equation (3) from (2):\n$$J_{2} - J_{3} = (J^{\\star} + C h_{2}^{p}) - (J^{\\star} + C h_{3}^{p}) = C (h_{2}^{p} - h_{3}^{p})$$\n\nNow, we can use the constant refinement ratio $r$. We can write $h_{1} = r h_{2}$ and $h_{2} = r h_{3}$. Substituting these into the difference equations:\n$$J_{1} - J_{2} = C ((r h_{2})^{p} - h_{2}^{p}) = C h_{2}^{p} (r^{p} - 1)$$\n$$J_{2} - J_{3} = C ((r h_{3})^{p} - h_{3}^{p}) = C h_{3}^{p} (r^{p} - 1)$$\n\nNext, we eliminate the constant $C$ and the term $(r^p - 1)$ by taking the ratio of these two new equations. This is permissible as long as $C \\neq 0$ (the error is not zero) and $r^p \\neq 1$ (which is true since $r=2$ and $p$ is expected to be positive for a converging scheme).\n$$\\frac{J_{1} - J_{2}}{J_{2} - J_{3}} = \\frac{C h_{2}^{p} (r^{p} - 1)}{C h_{3}^{p} (r^{p} - 1)} = \\frac{h_{2}^{p}}{h_{3}^{p}} = \\left(\\frac{h_{2}}{h_{3}}\\right)^{p}$$\nSince $h_{2}/h_{3} = r$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{J_{1} - J_{2}}{J_{2} - J_{3}} = r^{p}$$\nThis final equation relates the observable quantities (the computed fluxes and the refinement ratio) to the order of accuracy, $p$. To solve for $p$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{J_{1} - J_{2}}{J_{2} - J_{3}}\\right) = \\ln(r^{p})$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(a^b) = b \\ln(a)$, we get:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{J_{1} - J_{2}}{J_{2} - J_{3}}\\right) = p \\ln(r)$$\nIsolating $p$, we obtain the general formula for the observed order of accuracy:\n$$p = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{J_{1} - J_{2}}{J_{2} - J_{3}}\\right)}{\\ln(r)}$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values provided in the problem statement:\n- $J_{1} = 0.118$\n- $J_{2} = 0.112$\n- $J_{3} = 0.110$\n- $r = 2$\n\nFirst, compute the differences in the fluxes:\n$$J_{1} - J_{2} = 0.118 - 0.112 = 0.006$$\n$$J_{2} - J_{3} = 0.112 - 0.110 = 0.002$$\nNow substitute these values into the formula for $p$:\n$$p = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{0.006}{0.002}\\right)}{\\ln(2)} = \\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(2)}$$\nFinally, we compute the numerical value and round it to four significant figures as requested:\n$$p \\approx \\frac{1.0986122886...}{0.6931471805...} \\approx 1.5849625...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$p \\approx 1.585$$\nThis value represents the observed order of accuracy of the numerical scheme used to predict the wall flux.",
