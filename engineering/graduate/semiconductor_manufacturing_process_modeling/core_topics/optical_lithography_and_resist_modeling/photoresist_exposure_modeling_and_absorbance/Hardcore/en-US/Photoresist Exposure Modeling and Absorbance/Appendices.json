            "solution": "We begin by considering the attenuation of light intensity as it passes through an infinitesimally thin slab of the photoresist material. Let the slab be located at a depth $z$ from the surface and have a thickness $dz$. The cross-sectional area of the beam is constant, which we can denote by $A$.\n\nThe volume of this infinitesimal slab is $V_{slab} = A \\cdot dz$.\nThe number of absorbing chromophores within this slab is the product of their number density $N$ and the volume of the slab:\n$$dN_{chrom} = N V_{slab} = N A \\, dz$$\nEach chromophore presents an effective area $\\sigma$, its absorption cross-section, to the incident photons. The total effective absorption area presented by all chromophores in the slab is the product of the number of chromophores and the cross-section per chromophore:\n$$dA_{abs} = dN_{chrom} \\cdot \\sigma = (N A \\, dz) \\sigma$$\nThe probability that a photon traversing this slab is absorbed is the ratio of the total absorption area $dA_{abs}$ to the total area of the slab $A$:\n$$P_{abs} = \\frac{dA_{abs}}{A} = \\frac{N A \\sigma \\, dz}{A} = N \\sigma \\, dz$$\nLet $I(z)$ be the intensity (power per unit area) of the light at depth $z$. The power incident on the slab at $z$ is $P(z) = I(z) A$. The amount of power absorbed within the slab, $dP_{abs}$, is the incident power multiplied by the probability of absorption:\n$$dP_{abs} = P(z) \\cdot P_{abs} = (I(z) A) \\cdot (N \\sigma \\, dz)$$\nAccording to the principle of conservation of energy, and neglecting scattering and reflection, the change in power of the beam as it passes through the slab, $dP$, is equal to the negative of the power absorbed:\n$$dP = P(z+dz) - P(z) = -dP_{abs}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for power, we have:\n$$I(z+dz) A - I(z) A = -I(z) A N \\sigma \\, dz$$\nDividing by the area $A$:\n$$I(z+dz) - I(z) = -I(z) N \\sigma \\, dz$$\nThe term $I(z+dz) - I(z)$ is the infinitesimal change in intensity, $dI$. Thus, we arrive at the first-order ordinary differential equation governing the intensity $I(z)$:\n$$\\frac{dI}{dz} = -N \\sigma I(z)$$\nThe problem defines the absorption coefficient $\\alpha$ in terms of $\\sigma$ and $N$. From our governing equation, it is natural to define the product $N \\sigma$ as the absorption coefficient $\\alpha$:\n$$\\alpha \\equiv N \\sigma$$\nThe units of $\\alpha$ are $(\\text{length})^{-1}$, as $N$ has units of $(\\text{length})^{-3}$ and $\\sigma$ has units of $(\\text{length})^{2}$. With this definition, the differential equation becomes:\n$$\\frac{dI}{dz} = -\\alpha I(z)$$\nThis is a separable differential equation. We can solve it by separating variables and integrating. We separate $I$ and $z$ terms:\n$$\\frac{dI}{I} = -\\alpha \\, dz$$\nWe integrate both sides. The intensity varies from the incident intensity $I_0$ at the surface $z=0$ to the transmitted intensity $I(d)$ at the bottom of the film $z=d$:\n$$\\int_{I_0}^{I(d)} \\frac{dI}{I} = \\int_{0}^{d} -\\alpha \\, dz$$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$[\\ln|I|]_{I_0}^{I(d)} = [-\\alpha z]_{0}^{d}$$\n$$\\ln(I(d)) - \\ln(I_0) = -\\alpha d - 0$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{I(d)}{I_0}\\right) = -\\alpha d$$\nTo solve for the transmitted intensity $I(d)$, we exponentiate both sides of the equation:\n$$\\frac{I(d)}{I_0} = \\exp(-\\alpha d)$$\nThe transmitted intensity at the bottom surface $z=d$ is therefore:\n$$I(d) = I_0 \\exp(-\\alpha d)$$\nThis result is known as the Beer-Lambert law.\n\nFinally, we explain the physical meaning of the dimensionless quantity $\\alpha d$. The quantity $\\alpha d$ is known as the **optical depth** of the film, often denoted by $\\tau$. It is a measure of the transparency of the medium.\n- The ratio of transmitted to incident intensity is given by $I(d)/I_0 = \\exp(-\\alpha d)$. The optical depth $\\alpha d$ directly determines the fraction of light that passes through the film.\n- The absorption coefficient $\\alpha$ represents the probability of absorption per unit path length. Its reciprocal, $1/\\alpha$, is the mean free path of a photon before absorption.\n- The optical depth $\\alpha d = d / (1/\\alpha)$ can thus be interpreted as the thickness of the film measured in units of the photon mean free path for absorption.\n- If $\\alpha d = 1$, it means the film thickness is equal to one mean free path. Under this condition, the intensity is attenuated to $I_0 \\exp(-1) \\approx 0.37 I_0$.\n- If $\\alpha d \\ll 1$, the film is considered \"optically thin\". The transmission is high, and a small fraction of photons are absorbed. Here, $\\exp(-\\alpha d) \\approx 1 - \\alpha d$.\n- If $\\alpha d \\gg 1$, the film is \"optically thick\". The transmission is very low, and almost all photons are absorbed within the film.\nIn summary, the optical depth $\\alpha d$ is a dimensionless parameter that quantifies the total attenuation capacity of the photoresist film.\n\nThe problem asks for the single closed-form analytic expression for the transmitted intensity in terms of $I_{0}$, $\\alpha$, and $d$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a relationship between molar absorptivity and the optical extinction coefficient, the calculation of the total extinction coefficient for a photoresist film, and an interpretation of the result.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental relationships for optical absorption.\n\nThe Beer-Lambert law describes the attenuation of light in terms of absorbance, $A$, which is defined on a base-$10$ logarithm scale. For a species with molar absorptivity $\\epsilon$ and concentration $c$ over a path length $l$, the absorbance is:\n$$A = \\epsilon c l$$\nAbsorbance is also defined as the logarithm of the ratio of incident intensity, $I_0$, to transmitted intensity, $I$:\n$$A = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I_0}{I}\\right)$$\n\nIn electromagnetism and materials science, attenuation is often described using an exponential decay model based on the absorption coefficient, $\\alpha$. The intensity $I$ at a depth $z$ into the material is given by:\n$$I(z) = I_0 \\exp(-\\alpha z)$$\nFrom this, we can write $\\frac{I_0}{I(z)} = \\exp(\\alpha z)$.\n\nWe can connect these two descriptions by substituting the exponential form into the definition of absorbance. Setting the path length $l=z$:\n$$A = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I_0}{I(z)}\\right) = \\log_{10}(\\exp(\\alpha z))$$\nUsing the change of logarithm base formula, $\\log_{b}(x) = \\frac{\\ln(x)}{\\ln(b)}$, we have:\n$$A = \\frac{\\ln(\\exp(\\alpha z))}{\\ln(10)} = \\frac{\\alpha z}{\\ln(10)}$$\nEquating the two expressions for absorbance, $A = \\epsilon c z$ and $A = \\frac{\\alpha z}{\\ln(10)}$, we get:\n$$\\epsilon c z = \\frac{\\alpha z}{\\ln(10)}$$\nThe path length $z$ cancels, yielding the relationship between the absorption coefficient $\\alpha$ and the molar absorptivity $\\epsilon$:\n$$\\alpha = \\epsilon c \\ln(10)$$\n\nNext, we relate the absorption coefficient $\\alpha$ to the imaginary part of the complex refractive index, $k$ (the optical extinction coefficient). The complex refractive index is written as $\\tilde{n} = n + ik$. The propagation of the electric field plane wave in the $z$-direction is described by $E(z) = E_0 \\exp(i(\\tilde{n}k_0 z - \\omega t))$, where $k_0 = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}$ is the wave number in vacuum. Substituting $\\tilde{n}$:\n$$E(z) = E_0 \\exp(i((n+ik)k_0 z - \\omega t)) = E_0 \\exp(-k k_0 z) \\exp(i(n k_0 z - \\omega t))$$\nThe intensity $I$ is proportional to the square of the electric field's magnitude, $|E(z)|^2$:\n$$I(z) \\propto |E_0 \\exp(-k k_0 z)|^2 = I_0 \\exp(-2k k_0 z)$$\nComparing this with the definition $I(z) = I_0 \\exp(-\\alpha z)$, we identify the absorption coefficient as:\n$$\\alpha = 2k k_0 = 2k \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} = \\frac{4\\pi k}{\\lambda}$$\n\nNow we have two expressions for $\\alpha$. By equating them, we can derive the contribution of a substance with molar absorptivity $\\epsilon$ and concentration $c$ to the total extinction coefficient $k$. Let this contribution be $k_{\\mathrm{PAG}}$ for the Photoacid Generator (PAG).\n$$\\alpha_{\\mathrm{PAG}} = \\epsilon c \\ln(10) = \\frac{4\\pi k_{\\mathrm{PAG}}}{\\lambda}$$\nSolving for $k_{\\mathrm{PAG}}$, we obtain the desired relationship:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{PAG}} = \\frac{\\epsilon c \\lambda \\ln(10)}{4\\pi}$$\n\nThe problem states that the contributions from the polymer matrix and the PAG to absorption are additive. Therefore, the total effective extinction coefficient $k$ of the resist is the sum of the matrix's extinction coefficient, $k_{\\mathrm{m}}$, and the PAG's contribution, $k_{\\mathrm{PAG}}$.\n$$k = k_{\\mathrm{m}} + k_{\\mathrm{PAG}} = k_{\\mathrm{m}} + \\frac{\\epsilon c \\lambda \\ln(10)}{4\\pi}$$\n\nWe can now compute the numerical value of $k$. First, we calculate the dimensionless product $\\epsilon c \\lambda$. It is crucial to use consistent units. Let's convert all length units to centimeters ($\\mathrm{cm}$).\nGiven:\n$\\epsilon = 2.5 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{L\\,mol^{-1}\\,cm^{-1}}$\n$c = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$\n$\\lambda = 193\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 193 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n$k_{\\mathrm{m}} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-2}$ (dimensionless)\n\nThe product $\\epsilon c \\lambda$ is:\n$$\\epsilon c \\lambda = (2.5 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{L\\,mol^{-1}\\,cm^{-1}}) \\times (0.30\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}) \\times (193 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{cm})$$\nThe units cancel out: $(\\mathrm{L} \\cdot \\mathrm{mol} \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}) / (\\mathrm{mol} \\cdot \\mathrm{cm} \\cdot \\mathrm{L})$, leaving a dimensionless quantity.\n$$\\epsilon c \\lambda = (2.5 \\times 10^{3}) \\times 0.30 \\times (193 \\times 10^{-7}) = 750 \\times 193 \\times 10^{-7} = 144750 \\times 10^{-7} = 0.014475$$\nNow we compute $k_{\\mathrm{PAG}}$:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{PAG}} = \\frac{0.014475 \\times \\ln(10)}{4\\pi} \\approx \\frac{0.014475 \\times 2.302585}{4 \\times 3.141593} \\approx \\frac{0.033330}{12.56637} \\approx 0.00265236$$\nThe total extinction coefficient $k$ is:\n$$k = k_{\\mathrm{m}} + k_{\\mathrm{PAG}} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-2} + 0.00265236 = 0.030 + 0.00265236 = 0.03265236$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$k = 0.03265$$\n\nInterpretation of the result:\nThe total extinction coefficient $k=0.03265$ quantifies the opacity of the photoresist film at the exposure wavelength $\\lambda = 193\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. This value results from two components: the absorption of the polymer matrix ($k_{\\mathrm{m}} = 0.030$) and the absorption of the photoacid generator ($k_{\\mathrm{PAG}} \\approx 0.00265$).\n\n1.  **Absorbance and Acid Yield**: The primary function of the PAG is to absorb photons and generate acid, which then catalyzes a chemical change in the polymer matrix. The rate of acid generation is proportional to the light absorbed by the PAG, which is governed by $k_{\\mathrm{PAG}}$. A higher $k_{\\mathrm{PAG}}$ (from higher $\\epsilon$ or $c$) leads to a more sensitive resist (higher acid yield for a given dose). In this case, $k_{\\mathrm{PAG}}$ is a relatively small fraction of the total $k$, accounting for only $\\frac{0.00265}{0.03265} \\approx 8.1\\%$ of the total. This means over $90\\%$ of the absorbed light is non-productively captured by the matrix, a common issue in $193\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ resists.\n\n2.  **Transparency and Profile Control**: For high-fidelity patterning, the exposure dose should be as uniform as possible throughout the film's thickness. High total absorption (high $k$) causes a steep decay of light intensity from the top surface to the bottom, according to $I(z) = I_0 \\exp(-\\frac{4\\pi k z}{\\lambda})$. This intensity gradient leads to a corresponding gradient in acid concentration, which can result in tapered or sloped resist profiles after development, degrading pattern quality. For the given film of thickness $d = 100\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, the total absorption coefficient is $\\alpha = \\frac{4\\pi k}{\\lambda} \\approx \\frac{4\\pi(0.03265)}{193 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 2.125 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{m^{-1}}$. The intensity at the bottom of the film is $I(d) = I_0 \\exp(-\\alpha d) = I_0 \\exp(- (2.125 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{m^{-1}}) \\times (100 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m})) = I_0 \\exp(-0.2125) \\approx 0.8086 I_0$. About $81\\%$ of the incident light reaches the substrate, which is a reasonably uniform illumination for many applications.\n\n3.  **The Trade-off**: This illustrates a fundamental trade-off in resist design. To maximize photosensitivity, one would want to increase the PAG loading ($c$) or use a PAG with higher absorptivity ($\\epsilon$), thus increasing $k_{\\mathrm{PAG}}$. However, this also increases the total extinction coefficient $k$, reducing the film's transparency and potentially degrading the imaging performance (profile control). Resist formulation is an optimization problem balancing the need for high photospeed (driven by $k_{\\mathrm{PAG}}$) against the need for uniform through-film exposure (requiring low total $k$). The large \"background\" absorption from the matrix ($k_{\\mathrm{m}}$) exacerbates this problem, as it adds to the opacity without contributing to the desired photoreaction, thus narrowing the process window.",

This corresponds to the case where PAG depletion is negligible.\n\n2.  Large $\\sigma$ limit ($\\sigma \\to \\infty$):\n    As $\\sigma \\to \\infty$, the argument of the exponential, $-\\frac{\\sigma I_0 T \\exp(-\\alpha z)}{h\\nu}$, goes to $-\\infty$ (assuming $I_0 > 0$).\n    $$ \\lim_{\\sigma \\to \\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\sigma I_0 T \\exp(-\\alpha z)}{h\\nu}\\right) = 0 $$\n    Substituting this limit into the expression for $H(z)$:\n    $$ \\lim_{\\sigma \\to \\infty} H(z) = \\phi C_0 [1 - 0] = \\phi C_0 $$\n    In this limit, the acid concentration saturates at a maximum value of $\\phi C_0$. This physically means that the PAG absorption cross-section is so large that every PAG molecule is photolyzed, and the reaction proceeds to completion. The final acid concentration is limited only by the initial amount of PAG available and the quantum yield, and it becomes independent of the exposure dose and depth (as long as the dose is non-zero).",
