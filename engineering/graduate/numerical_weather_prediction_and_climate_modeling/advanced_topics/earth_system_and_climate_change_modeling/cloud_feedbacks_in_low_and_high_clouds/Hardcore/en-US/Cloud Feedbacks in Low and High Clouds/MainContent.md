## Introduction
Clouds are one of the most critical yet uncertain components of the climate system. Their response to global warming—the cloud feedback—is the primary factor determining how much our planet will warm in the future. Despite decades of research, the sign and magnitude of the net cloud feedback remain highly contested, leading to a wide range of projections from global climate models. Understanding the physical mechanisms behind these feedbacks and developing tools to diagnose them is therefore a central challenge in climate science.

This article provides a graduate-level overview of this crucial topic. In the first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, we will establish the fundamental theoretical framework for climate feedbacks, distinguishing them from forcings and rapid adjustments, and explore the distinct physical processes governing the radiative effects of low and high clouds. The second chapter, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, demonstrates how these principles are applied to diagnose climate models, evaluate their projections against observations, and understand phenomena ranging from ENSO to planetary climates. Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** section offers practical exercises to solidify your understanding of these complex interactions. Let's begin by defining the core concepts that form the foundation of all feedback analysis.

## Principles and Mechanisms

### Fundamental Concepts: Forcing, Adjustment, and Feedback

To comprehend the role of clouds in climate change, it is essential to first establish a clear framework for analyzing the Earth's energy balance. The climate system's response to an external perturbation, such as an increase in greenhouse gases, is not monolithic. It unfolds through a sequence of processes occurring on different timescales, which we categorize as forcing, rapid adjustments, and slow feedbacks.

A **forcing** is an initial energy imbalance imposed on the climate system. The **Effective Radiative Forcing (ERF)** is the most robust measure of this imbalance. It represents the change in the net radiative flux at the Top of Atmosphere (TOA) after allowing for certain rapid atmospheric processes to respond, but *before* any change in the global-mean surface temperature ($T_s$) occurs.

Crucially, some cloud changes fall into this category. **Rapid cloud adjustments** are changes in cloud properties (such as their amount, altitude, or water content) that are directly induced by the atmospheric effects of the forcing agent itself—for example, by the radiative absorption of added carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) within the atmospheric column. These adjustments happen quickly, on timescales of days to months, without any mediation from surface temperature changes. They are best diagnosed using Atmospheric General Circulation Models (AGCMs) where Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) are held fixed, thereby isolating the atmospheric response from the surface response . Any change in cloud radiative properties observed in such a fixed-SST experiment is, by definition, a rapid adjustment and is considered part of the ERF.

In contrast, **slow feedbacks** are changes in the climate system that are driven by and scale with the change in global-mean surface temperature, $\Delta T_s$. **Cloud feedback** is the archetype of a slow feedback. It is formally defined as the change in the net TOA radiation due to changes in cloud properties per unit of global surface temperature change. These changes occur as the entire climate system, including the oceans, warms. They are diagnosed in coupled atmosphere-ocean models where $T_s$ is allowed to evolve.

It is vital to distinguish these dynamic concepts from the static **Cloud Radiative Effect (CRE)**. The CRE is the difference between the all-sky and clear-sky net radiative fluxes at the TOA in a given, specific climate state. For the current climate, the global-mean CRE is approximately $-20 \, \mathrm{W\,m^{-2}}$, meaning that on balance, clouds have a net cooling effect on the planet. However, the sign and magnitude of the present-day CRE have no direct bearing on the sign or magnitude of the cloud feedback, which describes how the CRE *changes* as the planet warms .

To illustrate these distinctions, consider a climate model where the regression of all-sky TOA net flux ($R_{\mathrm{all}}$) against surface temperature ($T_s$) has a slope of $s_{\mathrm{all}} = \frac{dR_{\mathrm{all}}}{dT_s}$, and the equivalent for clear-sky flux ($R_{\mathrm{clr}}$) is $s_{\mathrm{clr}} = \frac{dR_{\mathrm{clr}}}{dT_s}$. The total climate feedback parameter is $\lambda_{\mathrm{all}} = -s_{\mathrm{all}}$, and the non-cloud feedback is $\lambda_{\mathrm{clr}} = -s_{\mathrm{clr}}$. The [cloud feedback](@entry_id:1122515) is the portion of this total feedback attributable to clouds, calculated as the difference between the all-sky and clear-sky feedback parameters:
$$
\lambda_{\mathrm{cld}} = \lambda_{\mathrm{all}} - \lambda_{\mathrm{clr}} = s_{\mathrm{clr}} - s_{\mathrm{all}}
$$
If a model yields $s_{\mathrm{all}} = -1.5 \, \mathrm{W\,m^{-2}\,K^{-1}}$ and $s_{\mathrm{clr}} = -1.2 \, \mathrm{W\,m^{-2}\,K^{-1}}$, the [cloud feedback](@entry_id:1122515) is $\lambda_{\mathrm{cld}} = -1.2 \, \mathrm{W\,m^{-2}\,K^{-1}} - (-1.5 \, \mathrm{W\,m^{-2}\,K^{-1}}) = +0.3 \, \mathrm{W\,m^{-2}\,K^{-1}}$. This value, a sensitivity in units of $\mathrm{W\,m^{-2}\,K^{-1}}$, is conceptually distinct from a rapid cloud adjustment of, for instance, $-0.4 \, \mathrm{W\,m^{-2}}$ (a flux contribution to ERF), and from the baseline CRE of $-20 \, \mathrm{W\,m^{-2}}$ (a flux in the unperturbed state) .

### Decomposing Climate Feedbacks and Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity

The concept of feedback is central to quantifying the magnitude of future warming. In a simplified linear framework, the equilibrium global-mean surface temperature change, $\Delta T_{s,eq}$, in response to a sustained forcing $F$ is given by:
$$
\Delta T_{s,eq} = \frac{F}{\lambda}
$$
where $\lambda$ is the net [climate feedback parameter](@entry_id:1122450). This parameter represents the system's restorative capacity: for a stable climate, $\lambda$ must be positive, indicating that as the planet warms, it radiates energy to space more effectively, thus counteracting the forcing. A smaller value of $\lambda$ implies a less effective [radiative damping](@entry_id:270883) and therefore a larger equilibrium warming for a given forcing. The **Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS)** is defined as $\Delta T_{s,eq}$ for a doubling of atmospheric $CO_2$, for which the forcing $F_{2\times}$ is approximately $3.7 \, \mathrm{W\,m^{-2}}$.

The net feedback parameter, $\lambda$, is the sum of contributions from various physical processes:
$$
\lambda = \lambda_{\mathrm{Planck}} + \lambda_{\mathrm{WV}} + \lambda_{\mathrm{LR}} + \lambda_{\mathrm{albedo}} + \lambda_{\mathrm{cld}}
$$
These components are :
- **Planck Feedback ($\lambda_{\mathrm{Planck}}$):** The most fundamental feedback. A warmer planet radiates more energy to space according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law ($E = \sigma T^4$). This is a strong, stabilizing (negative) feedback, corresponding to a positive value for $\lambda_{\mathrm{Planck}}$ (typically around $3.3 \, \mathrm{W\,m^{-2}\,K^{-1}}$).
- **Water Vapor Feedback ($\lambda_{\mathrm{WV}}$):** A warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor (as described by the Clausius-Clapeyron relation). Since water vapor is a potent greenhouse gas, this enhances the initial warming. It is a strong, destabilizing (positive) feedback, corresponding to a negative value for $\lambda_{\mathrm{WV}}$.
- **Lapse Rate Feedback ($\lambda_{\mathrm{LR}}$):** This feedback relates to changes in the vertical profile of atmospheric temperature. In the tropics, models predict that the upper troposphere will warm more than the surface. Since outgoing longwave radiation is sensitive to upper-tropospheric temperatures, this enhances [radiative cooling](@entry_id:754014) and constitutes a stabilizing (negative) feedback, corresponding to a positive $\lambda_{\mathrm{LR}}$.
- **Surface Albedo Feedback ($\lambda_{\mathrm{albedo}}$):** As the planet warms, snow and ice melt, revealing darker surfaces (land or ocean) that absorb more solar radiation. This is a destabilizing (positive) feedback, corresponding to a negative $\lambda_{\mathrm{albedo}}$.
- **Cloud Feedback ($\lambda_{\mathrm{cld}}$):** The response of clouds to warming, which is the focus of this chapter.

The sum of the relatively well-understood non-cloud feedbacks yields a net stabilizing effect. However, the [cloud feedback](@entry_id:1122515), $\lambda_{\mathrm{cld}}$, is highly uncertain. Climate models disagree on both its sign and magnitude, and this spread in $\lambda_{\mathrm{cld}}$ is the primary source of the spread in model estimates of ECS.

### Mechanisms of Cloud Feedback: A Shortwave and Longwave Perspective

To understand the physical origins of cloud feedback, we decompose the total cloud feedback parameter, $\lambda_{\mathrm{cld}}$, into its shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) radiative components:
$$
\lambda_{\mathrm{cld}} = \lambda_{\mathrm{cld}}^{\mathrm{SW}} + \lambda_{\mathrm{cld}}^{\mathrm{LW}}
$$
These two components are governed by different physical properties of clouds and often have opposing effects.

The **shortwave [cloud feedback](@entry_id:1122515)**, $\lambda_{\mathrm{cld}}^{\mathrm{SW}}$, arises from changes in how clouds interact with incoming solar radiation. The key property is **[cloud albedo](@entry_id:1122510)** (reflectivity). If, under warming, clouds become less reflective (lower albedo), the planet absorbs more solar energy, leading to further warming. This is a positive (destabilizing) feedback. Mathematically, the net downward SW flux at the TOA can be written as $N_{\mathrm{SW}} = \frac{S_0}{4}(1-\alpha_p)$, where $S_0$ is the solar constant and $\alpha_p$ is the planetary albedo. The SW cloud feedback is thus related to the sensitivity of [cloud albedo](@entry_id:1122510) to surface temperature :
$$
\lambda_{\mathrm{cld}}^{\mathrm{SW}} = \frac{\partial N_{\mathrm{SW,cld}}}{\partial T_s} \approx \frac{S_0}{4} \frac{d\alpha_{\mathrm{cld}}}{dT_s}
$$
A decrease in [cloud albedo](@entry_id:1122510) with warming ($d\alpha_{\mathrm{cld}}/dT_s  0$) results in a negative $\lambda_{\mathrm{cld}}^{\mathrm{SW}}$, corresponding to a positive (destabilizing) feedback. This effect is dominated by low-level clouds, which are extensive and highly reflective.

The **longwave [cloud feedback](@entry_id:1122515)**, $\lambda_{\mathrm{cld}}^{\mathrm{LW}}$, arises from changes in how clouds interact with outgoing terrestrial (infrared) radiation. The key property is the **cloud emission temperature**, which is typically the temperature at the cloud top. High, cold clouds act like a greenhouse blanket, trapping heat by emitting radiation to space at a much colder temperature than the surface. In a warming climate, these clouds tend to rise to higher altitudes. As a result, their emission temperature $T_{ct}$ rises, but by less than the surface temperature does. This suppresses the increase in Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR), effectively trapping heat and constituting a positive (destabilizing) feedback. Modeling the OLR from a cloud as $f_h \sigma T_{\mathrm{ct}}^4$, where $f_h$ is the cloud fraction and $T_{\mathrm{ct}}$ is the cloud-top temperature, the LW feedback can be expressed as:
$$
\lambda_{\mathrm{cld}}^{\mathrm{LW}} = -\frac{\partial (\mathrm{OLR}_{\mathrm{cld}})}{\partial T_s} \approx -4 f_h \sigma T_{\mathrm{ct}}^3 \frac{dT_{\mathrm{ct}}}{dT_s}
$$
Since $dT_{\mathrm{ct}}/dT_s > 0$, this yields a negative $\lambda_{\mathrm{cld}}^{\mathrm{LW}}$, which represents the positive (destabilizing) feedback. This effect is dominated by high-level clouds like cirrus and deep convective anvils.

### Low-Cloud Feedbacks: The Critical Role of Marine Stratocumulus

Low clouds, particularly the vast sheets of marine stratocumulus found over subtropical eastern oceans, exert a powerful cooling effect on the current climate due to their high albedo. How their properties might change with warming is therefore a critical question. The SW feedback from these clouds is primarily controlled by their **Liquid Water Path (LWP)**, the total mass of liquid water in a vertical column.

The physical linkage proceeds as follows: for a cloud with a given droplet size, the LWP determines the cloud's **[optical depth](@entry_id:159017)** ($\tau$). Optical depth is a dimensionless measure of how opaque the cloud is to radiation. A higher LWP leads to a higher optical depth. In turn, the cloud's albedo is a monotonically increasing, but saturating, function of its [optical depth](@entry_id:159017). For optically thin clouds, a small increase in $\tau$ produces a large increase in albedo. For very optically thick clouds, the albedo is already high, and further increases in $\tau$ yield only [diminishing returns](@entry_id:175447) in reflectivity .

A key process governing the LWP of marine stratocumulus is **[entrainment](@entry_id:275487)**, the mixing of warm, dry air from the free troposphere above into the cool, moist marine boundary layer below. This process has two primary effects on cloud liquid water, $q_l$. First, it introduces drier air, which promotes evaporation (the "drying effect"). Second, it introduces warmer air, which increases the boundary layer's capacity to hold water vapor (the "warming effect," governed by the Clausius-Clapeyron relation). Both effects act to reduce the amount of liquid water in the cloud . The rate of LWP destruction by entrainment is proportional to the [entrainment](@entry_id:275487) velocity, $w_e$. Some climate model projections suggest that $w_e$ may increase in a warmer climate, which would amplify the cloud-dissipating effect of entrainment, reduce LWP, lower [cloud albedo](@entry_id:1122510), and thus produce a **positive low-cloud feedback**.

However, other factors related to the large-scale atmospheric structure also play a crucial role. The strength of the temperature inversion that caps the boundary layer is a primary control on entrainment, with stronger inversions suppressing mixing and favoring more extensive cloud cover. A common metric for this is the **Lower-Tropospheric Stability (LTS)**, defined as the difference in potential temperature between the free troposphere (e.g., at $700 \, \mathrm{hPa}$) and the surface: $\mathrm{LTS} = \theta_{700} - \theta_{\mathrm{surf}}$. While LTS is well-correlated with low-cloud amount, a more refined metric, the **Estimated Inversion Strength (EIS)**, has been shown to be a better predictor, especially under climate change. EIS is defined as $\mathrm{EIS} = \mathrm{LTS} - \Gamma_m z_{700}$, where $\Gamma_m$ is the moist-[adiabatic lapse rate](@entry_id:193843) and $z_{700}$ is the height of the $700 \, \mathrm{hPa}$ level . This formulation accounts for the fact that as the climate warms, the [moist adiabat](@entry_id:1128088) cools less with height (i.e., $\Gamma_m$ decreases). This means that even if LTS were to remain constant, the inversion would effectively strengthen, suppressing entrainment and potentially leading to a **negative low-[cloud feedback](@entry_id:1122515)**. The net low-cloud feedback is thus a delicate balance between these competing thermodynamic and dynamic mechanisms.

### High-Cloud Feedbacks: The Dynamics of Tropical Anvils

High clouds, primarily the cirrus anvils detraining from deep convective systems in the tropics, have a net warming effect on the current climate. Their feedback contribution to climate change is complex, involving competing changes in their altitude, extent, and optical properties.

A robust finding across climate models is that as the troposphere warms, the tropopause rises, and convective clouds penetrate to higher altitudes. According to the **"Fixed Anvil Temperature" hypothesis**, high anvil clouds rise in a warming climate in just such a way as to maintain a nearly constant cloud-top temperature. This would imply a negligible LW feedback from cloud altitude changes. However, more nuanced analysis and model results suggest this is an oversimplification, and that anvil tops generally rise and their properties change.

As these anvils rise to colder altitudes, their greenhouse effect strengthens, producing a **positive LW feedback**. Simultaneously, the microphysical and dynamical adjustments associated with this rise can alter the cloud's SW properties. For instance, if the ice water path of the anvil decreases as it spreads out at a higher altitude, its optical depth will decrease. A reduction in the optical depth of a high, thick cloud makes it less reflective, which reduces its albedo. This decrease in albedo allows more solar radiation to be absorbed by the Earth system, creating a **positive SW feedback** . In this scenario, both the LW and SW components of the high-cloud feedback are positive, leading to a robustly positive net feedback that amplifies warming. While the exact magnitudes are model-dependent and subject to uncertainty in microphysical parameterizations, the tendency for high clouds to produce a positive feedback is a common feature in global climate models.

### Advanced Topics: Diagnostics and State Dependence

The decomposition of cloud feedback into SW/LW components and low/high cloud types provides a conceptual framework. To attribute these feedbacks to specific changes in observable cloud properties (like cloud fraction, water path, and altitude), climate scientists employ a diagnostic tool known as **radiative kernels**.

A [radiative kernel](@entry_id:1130508) for a given cloud property $x$ is the pre-computed partial derivative of the TOA [radiative flux](@entry_id:151732) with respect to that property, $\frac{\partial R}{\partial x}$, evaluated for a reference climate state. Kernels are calculated using sophisticated radiative transfer models and are typically functions of location, season, and cloud type. By multiplying these kernels with the predicted changes in cloud properties ($\Delta x$) from a climate model simulation, one can reconstruct the radiative impact of each specific cloud change . The total [cloud feedback](@entry_id:1122515) can thus be decomposed as:
$$
\Delta R_{\mathrm{cld}} \approx \sum_{i} \frac{\partial R}{\partial x_i} \Delta x_i
$$
where the sum is over all relevant cloud properties $x_i$. This method allows researchers to diagnose whether a model's [cloud feedback](@entry_id:1122515) is driven, for example, by a reduction in low-cloud amount, an increase in high-cloud altitude, or a change in cloud optical depth.

A final layer of complexity is the concept of **state dependence**. The linear feedback analysis assumes that the feedback parameter $\lambda$ is a constant. However, the real climate system is nonlinear, and the magnitude of a feedback may depend on the background climate state itself. For example, the relationship between SST and low-cloud fraction may be curved. If so, the slope of this relationship—and thus the low-[cloud feedback](@entry_id:1122515)—will be different in a world that is $2^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ warmer than in a world that is $4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ warmer .

This has profound implications: a feedback parameter diagnosed from historical variability may not be a reliable guide for the future. Researchers test for state dependence using advanced statistical techniques, such as fitting nonlinear models (e.g., Generalized Additive Models) to observational or model data, while controlling for confounding physical factors like [atmospheric stability](@entry_id:267207). In the modeling realm, state dependence can be diagnosed by performing experiments with different magnitudes of forcing (e.g., $2 \times CO_2$ vs. $4 \times CO_2$) and examining whether the inferred feedback parameter changes. The potential for state-dependent feedbacks underscores that quantifying the role of clouds remains one of the most challenging and important frontiers in climate science.
