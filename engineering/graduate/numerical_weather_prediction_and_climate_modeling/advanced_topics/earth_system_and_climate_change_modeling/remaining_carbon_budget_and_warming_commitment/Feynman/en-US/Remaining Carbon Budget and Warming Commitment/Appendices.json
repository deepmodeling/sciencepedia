The total forcing decomposes into carbon dioxide ($\\mathrm{CO_2}$) and non-carbon dioxide (non-$\\mathrm{CO_2}$) components, $F(t) = F_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}(t) + F_{\\mathrm{nc}}(t)$. Assume that the non-$\\mathrm{CO_2}$ forcing is held constant in time, i.e., $F_{\\mathrm{nc}}(t) = F_{\\mathrm{nc},0}$.\n\nTake as a widely supported emergent property of comprehensive climate models the Transient Climate Response to cumulative carbon emissions (TCRE): the $\\mathrm{CO_2}$-induced warming can be approximated as $T_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}(t) \\approx \\beta\\,E_{\\mathrm{cum}}(t)$, where $E_{\\mathrm{cum}}(t)$ is the cumulative anthropogenic $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ emissions up to time $t$, and $\\beta$ is a constant. Further assume the Zero Emissions Commitment (ZEC) over multidecadal timescales is negligible, i.e., after net-zero $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ emissions, $T_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}(t)$ does not exhibit a systematic drift.

The function describing this linear decline over the interval $[t_0, Y]$ is:\n$$E(t) = E_0 \\left( 1 - \\frac{t - t_0}{Y - t_0} \\right)$$\nThe integral of $E(t)$ from $t_0$ to $Y$ represents the area of a triangle with base $(Y - t_0)$ and height $E_0$:\n$$\\int_{t_0}^{Y} E(t)\\,dt = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} (Y - t_0) E_0$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $E_{\\mathrm{cum}}(Y)$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{cum}}(Y) = E_{\\mathrm{cum}}(t_0) + \\frac{1}{2} E_0 (Y - t_0)$$\nThe peak $\\mathrm{CO_2}$-induced warming as a function of the net-zero year $Y$ is therefore:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{CO_2}, \\text{peak}}(Y) = \\beta \\left( E_{\\mathrm{cum}}(t_0) + \\frac{1}{2} E_0 (Y - t_0) \\right)$$\nTo determine how the peak warming depends on the net-zero year $Y$, we can examine the derivative of $T_{\\mathrm{CO_2}, \\text{peak}}(Y)$ with respect to $Y$.

Consequently, an earlier net-zero date (a smaller value of $Y$) implies a lower peak warming due to $\\mathrm{CO_2}$. The non-$\\mathrm{CO_2}$ forcing is constant, so its contribution to warming does not change between scenarios. Thus, the total peak warming is also lower for an earlier net-zero date. This completes the analytical justification.\n\n**Part 2: Quantitative Calculation**\n\nWe are asked to compute the difference in peak GMSAT anomaly due to $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ between two scenarios: net-zero in $Y_2 = 2050$ versus net-zero in $Y_1 = 2040$.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in established climate science principles (energy balance models, radiative forcing, and TCRE), is well-posed with a complete set of parameters and a clear objective, and is free of ambiguities or contradictions. We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe problem requires a numerical simulation to quantify the impact of spatially heterogeneous aerosol forcing on estimates of the remaining carbon budget. The solution is derived by first solving a time-dependent energy balance equation for the aerosol-induced temperature change and then using this result to calculate two different estimates of the carbon budget.\n\n**1. Governing Physical and Mathematical Principles**\n\nThe core of the simulation is the global-mean one-box energy balance model, which describes the evolution of the aerosol-induced global-mean surface temperature anomaly, $T_a(t)$, over time $t$:\n$$\nC \\frac{dT_a(t)}{dt} = R_{\\mathrm{eff}}(t) - \\lambda T_a(t)\n$$\nHere, $C$ is the effective heat capacity of the climate system, $\\lambda$ is the climate feedback parameter, and $R_{\\mathrm{eff}}(t)$ is the global-mean effective radiative forcing from aerosols. The term $\\lambda T_a(t)$ represents the restorative energy flux to space as the planet warms, and $C \\frac{dT_a(t)}{dt}$ represents the net energy uptake by the system.\n\nThe effective radiative forcing, $R_{\\mathrm{eff}}(t)$, is not uniform. It is calculated as a weighted average over $R$ distinct geographical regions:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{eff}}(t) = \\sum_{r=1}^R f_r \\, e_r \\, F_r(t)\n$$\nwhere for each region $r$, $f_r$ is its fractional area of the globe ($\\sum_r f_r = 1$), $F_r(t)$ is the regional radiative forcing, and $e_r$ is the efficacy. Efficacy is a crucial dimensionless parameter that accounts for the fact that a forcing of a given magnitude (in $\\mathrm{W \\, m^{-2}}$) can produce a larger or smaller global temperature response depending on where it is applied.\n\nThe aerosol forcing is prescribed to be constant until a phase-out time, $t_{\\mathrm{stop}}$, after which it abruptly becomes zero:\n$$\nF_r(t) = \\begin{cases} F_r & \\text{for } t < t_{\\mathrm{stop}} \\\\ 0 & \\text{for } t \\ge t_{\\mathrm{stop}} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThis models a scenario where aerosol pollution is entirely eliminated.\n\nThe warming due to carbon dioxide is modeled using the Transient Climate Response to cumulative carbon Emissions (TCRE), which posits a linear relationship between warming and total emitted carbon:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}(t) = \\gamma E(t)\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the TCRE constant and $E(t)$ is the cumulative $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ emissions.\n\n**2. Numerical Discretization and Simulation Algorithm**\n\nThe differential equation for $T_a(t)$ must be solved numerically. The problem specifies a forward-Euler method with a discrete annual time step, $\\Delta t = 1 \\, \\mathrm{yr}$. Discretizing the derivative as $\\frac{dT_a}{dt} \\approx \\frac{T_a(t+\\Delta t) - T_a(t)}{\\Delta t}$, we can rearrange the energy balance equation to obtain an explicit update rule for the temperature at the next time step, $t+\\Delta t$, based on its value at the current time step, $t$:\n$$\nT_a(t+\\Delta t) = T_a(t) + \\frac{\\Delta t}{C}\\left(R_{\\mathrm{eff}}(t) - \\lambda T_a(t)\\right)\n$$\nThis can be grouped into a more computationally convenient form:\n$$\nT_a(t+\\Delta t) = T_a(t) \\left(1 - \\frac{\\lambda \\Delta t}{C}\\right) + R_{\\mathrm{eff}}(t) \\frac{\\Delta t}{C}\n$$\nThe simulation proceeds as follows:\n1.  **Initialization**: Set the initial temperature anomaly to zero, $T_a(0) = 0$. An array is initialized to store the temperature values for each year from $t=0$ to $t=t_{\\mathrm{eval}}$.\n2.  **Forcing Calculation**: For a given test case, the constant effective radiative forcing during the aerosol era ($t < t_{\\mathrm{stop}}$) is pre-calculated: $R_{\\mathrm{eff,on}} = \\sum_{r=1}^R f_r e_r F_r$. For $t \\ge t_{\\mathrm{stop}}$, the forcing is $R_{\\mathrm{eff,off}} = 0$.\n3.  **Time-stepping Loop**: A loop iterates from $t = 0$ to $t = t_{\\mathrm{eval}} - 1$ in steps of $\\Delta t=1 \\, \\mathrm{yr}$. In each iteration:\n    a. The appropriate forcing $R_{\\mathrm{eff}}(t)$ is selected based on whether the current time $t$ is less than $t_{\\mathrm{stop}}$.\n    b. The forward-Euler update rule is applied to compute $T_a(t+\\Delta t)$ and store it.\n4.  **Result Extraction**: After the loop completes, the simulated temperature time series is fully populated. The required values, $T_a(t_0)$ and $T_a(t_{\\mathrm{eval}})$, are extracted from the stored array at the corresponding time indices.\n\n**3. Carbon Budget Calculation**\n\nWith the simulated aerosol-induced temperatures, the two remaining carbon budget estimates are calculated. First, the present-day warming from $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ is computed:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{CO_2},0} = \\gamma E_0\n$$\nThe total present-day warming is the sum of the $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ and aerosol contributions: $T_{\\mathrm{total},0} = T_{\\mathrm{CO_2},0} + T_a(t_0)$. Note that since $T_a(t_0)$ is negative, it represents a cooling that \"masks\" some of the $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ warming.\n\nThe first budget estimate, $B_{\\mathrm{masked}}$, calculates the remaining allowable emissions assuming this masking effect persists indefinitely. The remaining warming \"headroom\" to the target $T^*$ is $T^* - T_{\\total,0}$. Using the TCRE relationship, this is converted to a\ncarbon budget:\n$$\nB_{\\mathrm{masked}} = \\max\\left(0, \\frac{T^* - (T_{\\mathrm{CO_2},0} + T_a(t_0))}{\\gamma}\\right)\n$$\nThe second estimate, $B_{\\mathrm{true}}$, accounts for the \"committed warming\" that will be realized once aerosols are removed. At time $t_{\\mathrm{eval}}$, well after the aerosol phase-out at $t_{\\mathrm{stop}}$, the temperature $T_a(t_{\\mathrm{eval}})$ represents the residual (decaying) temperature effect from the past aerosol forcing. The total committed warming, from current $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ levels and past aerosol effects, is $T_{\\mathrm{commit}} = T_{\\mathrm{CO_2},0} + T_a(t_{\\mathrm{eval}})$. Note that $T_a(t_{\\mathrm{eval}})$ will be a smaller negative number than $T_a(t_0)$, or even close to zero, reflecting the unmasking of warming. The true remaining carbon budget is therefore:\n$$\nB_{\\mathrm{true}} = \\max\\left(0, \\frac{T^* - (T_{\\mathrm{CO_2},0} + T_a(t_{\\mathrm{eval}}))}{\\gamma}\\right)\n$$\nThis procedure is applied to each of the four test cases to generate the final results. The comparison between $B_{\\mathrm{masked}}$ and $B_{\\mathrm{true}}$ directly quantifies the overestimation of the carbon budget that occurs if one neglects the future warming commitment from aerosol removal.",
