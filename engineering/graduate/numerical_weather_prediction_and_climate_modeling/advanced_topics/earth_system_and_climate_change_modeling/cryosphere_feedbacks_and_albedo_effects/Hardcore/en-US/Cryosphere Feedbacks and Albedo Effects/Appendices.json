The concept of a temperature-dependent albedo is a crucial component of the ice-albedo feedback mechanism, a fundamental process in the climate system. The linearization of albedo is a standard and valid approximation for small temperature perturbations. The provided numerical values for albedo at melt onset ($\\alpha_0 = 0.62$), its sensitivity to temperature ($\\alpha_1 = -1.2 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$), and downwelling shortwave radiation ($S = 320\\ \\mathrm{W\\, m^{-2}}$) are physically plausible for a melting sea ice surface in the polar summer. The negative sign of $\\alpha_1$ correctly represents that albedo decreases as surface temperature increases near the melting point.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined. It requests a specific mathematical derivation (a partial derivative) and its subsequent numerical evaluation. The given information is sufficient and self-contained, leading to a unique and meaningful solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, objective, and scientific terminology. It is free of any ambiguity, subjectivity, or opinion-based statements.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the listed invalidity flaws. It is scientifically sound, formally structured, internally consistent, and physically realistic.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe net absorbed shortwave flux at the surface, which we denote as $Q_{\\mathrm{abs}}$, is defined as the incoming downwelling shortwave irradiance, $S$, minus the portion that is reflected. The reflected portion is the product of the downwelling irradiance and the surface albedo, $\\alpha(T_s)$.\n\nTherefore, the governing equation for the absorbed shortwave flux is:\n$$\nQ_{\\mathrm{abs}}(T_s) = S - S \\cdot \\alpha(T_s) = S(1 - \\alpha(T_s))\n$$\nThe problem provides a linearized parameterization for the surface albedo as a function of the surface skin temperature $T_s$:\n$$\n\\alpha(T_s) = \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 T_s\n$$\nSubstituting this albedo parameterization into the equation for $Q_{\\mathrm{abs}}(T_s)$ yields:\n$$\nQ_{\\mathrm{abs}}(T_s) = S(1 - (\\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 T_s))\n$$\nExpanding this expression gives:\n$$\nQ_{\\mathrm{abs}}(T_s) = S - S\\alpha_0 - S\\alpha_1 T_s\n$$\nThe problem requires the derivation of the local sensitivity of the absorbed shortwave flux to small changes in $T_s$. This is mathematically expressed as the partial derivative of $Q_{\\mathrm{abs}}$ with respect to $T_s$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial Q_{\\mathrm{abs}}}{\\partial T_s} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T_s} (S - S\\alpha_0 - S\\alpha_1 T_s)\n$$\nIn this expression, $S$, $\\alpha_0$, and $\\alpha_1$ are constants with respect to the variable of differentiation, $T_s$. The derivative of the constant terms $S$ and $-S\\alpha_0$ with respect to $T_s$ is $0$. The derivative of the term $-S\\alpha_1 T_s$ with respect to $T_s$ is $-S\\alpha_1$. Therefore, the sensitivity is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial Q_{\\mathrm{abs}}}{\\partial T_s} = -S\\alpha_1\n$$\nThis is the analytic expression for the sensitivity. The problem asks for this sensitivity to be evaluated at melt onset, i.e., at $T_s = 0$. Since the derived expression for the sensitivity, $-S\\alpha_1$, is independent of $T_s$, its value at $T_s = 0$ is simply $-S\\alpha_1$. This is an expected consequence of the linear model for albedo, which results in a linear model for absorbed flux, whose derivative is constant.\n\nThe physical interpretation of this result is that it quantifies the strength of the ice-albedo feedback on shortwave absorption. Since $\\alpha_1$ is negative (warming decreases albedo), the sensitivity $\\frac{\\partial Q_{\\mathrm{abs}}}{\\partial T_s}$ is positive, indicating that as the surface warms, it absorbs more shortwave radiation, which promotes further warming.\n\nNext, we evaluate this sensitivity numerically using the provided values:\n- $S = 3.20 \\times 10^{2}\\ \\mathrm{W\\, m^{-2}}$\n- $\\alpha_1 = -1.2 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial Q_{\\mathrm{abs}}}{\\partial T_s} \\Big|_{T_s=0} = - (3.20 \\times 10^{2}\\ \\mathrm{W\\, m^{-2}}) \\times (-1.2 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1})\n$$\n$$\n= (3.20 \\times 1.2) \\times (10^{2} \\times 10^{-2})\\ \\mathrm{W\\, m^{-2}\\, K^{-1}}\n$$\n$$\n= 3.84 \\ \\mathrm{W\\, m^{-2}\\, K^{-1}}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final numerical answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $3.84$. To express this with four significant figures, we add a trailing zero.\n$$\n3.840\\ \\mathrm{W\\, m^{-2}\\, K^{-1}}\n$$\nThe analytic expression for the sensitivity is $-S\\alpha_1$ and its numerical value is $3.840\\ \\mathrm{W\\, m^{-2}\\, K^{-1}}$.",

            "solution": "The problem of determining the equilibrium surface temperature, $T_s$, by closing the surface energy balance is a fundamental exercise in climate and atmospheric science. The problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed for numerical solution, and provides all necessary parameters and physical formulations. We shall proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe governing principle is the conservation of energy at the surface. At equilibrium, the net energy flux into the surface must be zero. The total flux is composed of radiative and non-radiative components. We define a residual function, $F(T_s)$, representing the net energy flux into the surface. The equilibrium temperature $T_s$ is the value for which $F(T_s) = 0$.\n\nThe energy fluxes are defined as follows, with fluxes directed toward the surface considered positive:\n$1$. Net Shortwave Radiation ($R_{s,net}$): The portion of incoming solar radiation ($S_\\downarrow$) that is absorbed by the surface. It is given by $R_{s,net} = (1 - \\alpha(T_s)) S_\\downarrow$, where $\\alpha(T_s)$ is the surface albedo.\n$2$. Net Longwave Radiation ($R_{l,net}$): The difference between the downward longwave radiation from the atmosphere ($L_\\downarrow$) and the upward thermal radiation emitted by the surface ($L_\\uparrow$). Based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law, $L_\\uparrow = \\varepsilon \\sigma T_s^4$, where $\\varepsilon$ is the surface emissivity and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Thus, $R_{l,net} = L_\\downarrow - \\varepsilon \\sigma T_s^4$.\n$3$. Sensible Heat Flux ($H$): The flux of heat between the surface and the atmosphere due to temperature difference. It is defined as a flux away from the surface, $H = C_H (T_s - T_a)$, where $C_H$ is a bulk transfer coefficient and $T_a$ is the near-surface air temperature.\n$4$. Ground Heat Flux ($G$): The flux of heat into the underlying soil or ice. It is also defined as a flux away from the surface, $G = C_G (T_s - T_d)$, where $C_G$ is a soil coupling coefficient and $T_d$ is the deep soil temperature.\n\nThe total energy balance equation is the sum of the net radiative fluxes minus the turbulent and ground fluxes directed away from the surface:\n$$\nF(T_s) = R_{s,net} + R_{l,net} - H - G = 0\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for each flux, we obtain the explicit form of the residual function:\n$$\nF(T_s) = (1 - \\alpha(T_s)) S_\\downarrow + L_\\downarrow - \\varepsilon \\sigma T_s^4 - C_H (T_s - T_a) - C_G (T_s - T_d)\n$$\nThe albedo, $\\alpha(T_s)$, is not a constant but a function of the surface temperature itself. This represents a critical cryospheric feedback: as the surface warms past the melting point of water, snow and ice melt, drastically reducing the surface reflectivity and leading to further absorption of solar radiation. This is modeled using a logistic function:\n$$\n\\alpha(T_s) = \\alpha_{\\mathrm{bare}} + \\frac{\\alpha_{\\mathrm{snow}} - \\alpha_{\\mathrm{bare}}}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{T_s - T_m}{\\Delta}\\right)}\n$$\nHere, $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{snow}}$ is the albedo of a snow-covered surface, $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{bare}}$ is the albedo of a snow-free surface, $T_m$ is the melting transition temperature (e.g., $273.15\\ \\mathrm{K}$), and $\\Delta$ is a scale parameter that determines the sharpness of the transition. For temperatures $T_s \\ll T_m$, $\\alpha(T_s) \\to \\alpha_{\\mathrm{snow}}$. For temperatures $T_s \\gg T_m$, $\\alpha(T_s) \\to \\alpha_{\\mathrm{bare}}$.\n\nThe equation $F(T_s) = 0$ is a non-linear transcendental equation in $T_s$ due to the $T_s^4$ term and the exponential term within $\\alpha(T_s)$. There is no general analytical solution, so a numerical root-finding algorithm is required. The problem specifies a bracketing interval of $[220\\ \\mathrm{K}, 310\\ \\mathrm{K}]$ for the solution. A key property of the function $F(T_s)$ is that for very low $T_s$, the outgoing radiation term $\\varepsilon \\sigma T_s^4$ is small, and $F(T_s)$ is typically positive. For very high $T_s$, this $T_s^4$ term dominates, making $F(T_s)$ strongly negative. This ensures that if the function is continuous, at least one root must exist within a sufficiently wide bracket. The presence of the albedo feedback term can, under certain conditions, lead to multiple equilibria, but a bracketing method like Brent's method will reliably find a root if the function values at the bracket endpoints have opposite signs.\n\nThe algorithm to solve the problem is as follows:\n$1$. Implement the albedo function $\\alpha(T_s)$ as defined.\n$2$. Implement the residual function $F(T_s)$ using the full energy balance equation.\n$3$. For each of the four test cases provided, supply the specified parameter values to the function $F(T_s)$.\n$4$. Use a robust numerical root-finding algorithm, such as Brent's method (`scipy.optimize.brentq`), to find the root of $F(T_s)=0$ within the physically plausible bracket $[220\\ \\mathrm{K}, 310\\ \\mathrm{K}]$.\n$5$.
