            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated and found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of energy conservation as applied to climate science, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is formulated with objective, precise language.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as required: derivation of the analytical expression for Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS), dimensional analysis of the expression, and numerical calculation of its value.\n\nFirst, we establish the governing equation for the zero-dimensional energy balance model. The net radiative imbalance at the top of the atmosphere (TOA), denoted by $N$, is the difference between the energy absorbed and the energy emitted by the Earth system. In response to a perturbation, this imbalance can be expressed as the sum of the external forcing and the system's radiative response.\n\nThe problem specifies an externally imposed radiative forcing $F_{2x}$ due to a doubling of atmospheric $\\text{CO}_2$. This forcing acts to increase the energy in the system. The system responds to the resulting increase in global-mean surface temperature, $\\Delta T$, by increasing its outgoing longwave radiation. The climate feedback parameter, $\\lambda$, quantifies this response. It is defined as the incremental TOA radiative loss per unit increase in $\\Delta T$. Therefore, the radiative response (the feedback) is a loss of energy from the system, given by the term $\\lambda \\Delta T$.\n\nThe equation for the net TOA radiative imbalance is:\n$$N = F_{2x} - \\lambda \\Delta T$$\nHere, $F_{2x}$ is the energy gain (positive) and $\\lambda \\Delta T$ is the energy loss (negative sign) that counteracts the forcing.\n\nEquilibrium Climate Sensitivity, denoted as $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eq}}$, is defined as the global-mean surface temperature change once the system reaches a new equilibrium state after the imposition of the forcing $F_{2x}$. At equilibrium, the net radiative imbalance at the TOA must vanish, so $N = 0$. Substituting $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ for $\\Delta T$ in the energy balance equation under the equilibrium condition gives:\n$$0 = F_{2x} - \\lambda \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eq}}$$\nWe can now solve for $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ to derive the analytical expression for ECS:\n$$\\lambda \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eq}} = F_{2x}$$\n$$\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{F_{2x}}{\\lambda}$$\nThis is the analytical expression for the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity in terms of the radiative forcing $F_{2x}$ and the climate feedback parameter $\\lambda$.\n\nSecond, we perform a dimensional analysis to verify the derived expression has units of temperature. Let $[X]$ denote the physical units of a quantity $X$. The units provided in the problem are:\n- For radiative forcing, $[F_{2x}] = \\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$ (watts per square meter).\n- For the climate feedback parameter, $[\\lambda] = \\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$ (watts per square meter per Kelvin).\n\nThe units of $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ are therefore:\n$$[\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eq}}] = \\frac{[F_{2x}]}{[\\lambda]} = \\frac{\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}}{\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}}$$\nThe units of $\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$ in the numerator and denominator cancel, leaving:\n$$[\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eq}}] = \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{K}^{-1}} = \\mathrm{K}$$\nThe dimensional analysis confirms that the expression for ECS correctly yields units of temperature (Kelvin), which is physically consistent.\n\nThird, we compute the numerical value of ECS using the provided data:\n$F_{2x} = 3.7\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$\n$\\lambda = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{3.7\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}}{1.0\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}}$$\n$$\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 3.7\\,\\mathrm{K}$$\nThe problem requires the final numerical answer to be rounded to three significant figures. Therefore, we express the result as $3.70$.",

The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information (means, standard deviations, and the assumption of independence) to solve for the variance using the specified method of propagation of uncertainty. The language is objective and precise. The problem is not trivial, as it requires knowledge of calculus (partial derivatives) and statistics (propagation of uncertainty) applied to a core concept in climate science. There are no internal contradictions or scientifically implausible conditions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) is defined as the equilibrium global-mean surface temperature change in response to a specified forcing, $F_{2x}$. At equilibrium, the net radiative imbalance at the top of the atmosphere is zero, so $N=0$. Substituting the definitions into the given energy balance model:\n$$0 = F_{2x} - \\lambda \\cdot \\text{ECS}$$\nSolving for ECS gives the functional relationship between ECS and the variables $F_{2x}$ and $\\lambda$:\n$$\\text{ECS}(F_{2x}, \\lambda) = \\frac{F_{2x}}{\\lambda}$$\n\nWe are asked to find the variance of ECS, denoted as $\\mathrm{Var}(\\text{ECS})$, arising from the uncertainties in $F_{2x}$ and $\\lambda$. We use the formula for the propagation of uncertainty for a function of two independent random variables, which is derived from a first-order Taylor series expansion of the function around the mean values. For a function $g(X, Y)$, where $X$ and $Y$ are independent, the variance is approximated by:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(g) \\approx \\left( \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial X} \\right)^2 \\mathrm{Var}(X) + \\left( \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial Y} \\right)^2 \\mathrm{Var}(Y)$$\nThe partial derivatives are evaluated at the mean values of the variables, $(\\bar{X}, \\bar{Y})$. In our problem, $g = \\text{ECS}$, $X = F_{2x}$, and $Y = \\lambda$. The variances are given by the square of the standard deviations, $\\mathrm{Var}(F_{2x}) = \\sigma_F^2$ and $\\mathrm{Var}(\\lambda) = \\sigma_{\\lambda}^2$.\n\nFirst, we compute the necessary partial derivatives of $\\text{ECS}(F_{2x}, \\lambda)$:\n1.  Partial derivative with respect to $F_{2x}$:\n    $$\\frac{\\partial(\\text{ECS})}{\\partial F_{2x}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial F_{2x}} \\left( \\frac{F_{2x}}{\\lambda} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}$$\n2.  Partial derivative with respect to $\\lambda$:\n    $$\\frac{\\partial(\\text{ECS})}{\\partial \\lambda} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\lambda} \\left( F_{2x} \\lambda^{-1} \\right) = -F_{2x} \\lambda^{-2} = -\\frac{F_{2x}}{\\lambda^2}$$\n\nNext, we evaluate these derivatives at the mean values, $\\bar{F}$ and $\\bar{\\lambda}$:\n$$\\left. \\frac{\\partial(\\text{ECS})}{\\partial F_{2x}} \\right|_{(\\bar{F}, \\bar{\\lambda})} = \\frac{1}{\\bar{\\lambda}}$$\n$$\\left. \\frac{\\partial(\\text{ECS})}{\\partial \\lambda} \\right|_{(\\bar{F}, \\bar{\\lambda})} = -\\frac{\\bar{F}}{\\bar{\\lambda}^2}$$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the variance propagation formula:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(\\text{ECS}) \\approx \\left( \\frac{1}{\\bar{\\lambda}} \\right)^2 \\sigma_F^2 + \\left( -\\frac{\\bar{F}}{\\bar{\\lambda}^2} \\right)^2 \\sigma_{\\lambda}^2$$\nThis simplifies to the leading-order expression for the variance of ECS:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(\\text{ECS}) \\approx \\frac{\\sigma_F^2}{\\bar{\\lambda}^2} + \\frac{\\bar{F}^2 \\sigma_{\\lambda}^2}{\\bar{\\lambda}^4}$$\nThis completes the derivation part of the problem.\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression. The units for ECS are Kelvin ($\\mathrm{K}$), so the variance will be in $\\mathrm{K}^2$.\nGiven values:\n$\\bar{F} = 3.71$\n$\\sigma_F = 0.10$\n$\\bar{\\lambda} = 1.20$\n$\\sigma_{\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(\\text{ECS}) \\approx \\frac{(0.10)^2}{(1.20)^2} + \\frac{(3.71)^2 (0.30)^2}{(1.20)^4}$$\nLet's calculate each term separately.\nFirst term:\n$$\\frac{(0.10)^2}{(1.20)^2} = \\frac{0.01}{1.44} \\approx 0.0069444...$$\nSecond term:\n$$\\frac{(3.71)^2 (0.30)^2}{(1.20)^4} = \\frac{(13.7641)(0.09)}{2.0736} = \\frac{1.238769}{2.0736} \\approx 0.5974046...$$\nSumming the two terms:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(\\text{ECS}) \\approx 0.0069444... + 0.5974046... = 0.6043490...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(\\text{ECS}) \\approx 0.6043\\,\\mathrm{K}^2$$\nThe result shows that the uncertainty in the climate feedback parameter $\\lambda$ contributes much more significantly to the uncertainty in ECS than the uncertainty in the forcing $F_{2x}$ for these given values, which is a well-known result in climate science.",
