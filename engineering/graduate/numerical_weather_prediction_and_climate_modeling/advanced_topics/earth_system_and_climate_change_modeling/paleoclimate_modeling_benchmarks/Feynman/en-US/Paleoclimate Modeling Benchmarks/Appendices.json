The principles and results are part of established, verifiable science.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\nThe solution will be developed in three parts as requested: first, the justification for the logarithmic dependence of radiative forcing; second, the numerical calculation of the forcing difference; and third, the explanation for the additivity of forcings.\n\n**Part 1: Justification of the Logarithmic Forcing Dependence**\n\nThe radiative forcing, $\\Delta F$, due to a change in a greenhouse gas concentration is the net change in the radiative flux at the tropopause after the stratosphere has adjusted to a new radiative equilibrium. The logarithmic relationship for carbon dioxide, $\\Delta F \\propto \\ln(C/C_0)$, arises from the effects of spectral line saturation.\n\nAccording to the Beer–Lambert law, the monochromatic transmittance $T_\\nu$ at frequency $\\nu$ through a path with optical depth $\\tau_\\nu$ is $T_\\nu = \\exp(-\\tau_\\nu)$. The optical depth is proportional to the column abundance of the absorber, $u$, which for a well-mixed gas like $\\text{CO}_2$ is proportional to its volume mixing ratio, $C$. Thus, $\\tau_\\nu \\propto C$.\n\nThe primary absorption band for $\\text{CO}_2$ in the thermal infrared is centered around a wavelength of $15\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. At present-day concentrations, the core of this band is highly saturated, meaning the atmosphere is already opaque ($\\tau_\\nu \\gg 1$ and $T_\\nu \\approx 0$) at the frequencies corresponding to the centers of the main absorption lines. When $\\text{CO}_2$ concentration increases, these saturated line centers can absorb very little additional radiation.\n\nThe increase in absorption, and thus the radiative forcing, therefore occurs primarily in the \"wings\" of the absorption lines, where the atmosphere is still partially transparent ($\\tau_\\nu \\approx 1$ or $\\tau_\\nu < 1$). For a pressure-broadened line (Lorentzian profile), the absorption coefficient decreases quadratically with the frequency shift from the line center. The increase in forcing comes from the widening of the spectral region over which the atmosphere becomes effectively opaque.\n\nA simplified model for an absorption band consisting of many overlapping pressure-broadened lines shows that the total band absorptance, $A_{\\text{band}} = \\int (1 - T_\\nu) d\\nu$, does not grow linearly with concentration $C$ (which would be the case for weak, non-overlapping lines), but rather approximately as the logarithm of the concentration, $A_{\\text{band}} \\propto \\ln(C)$. Since the change in longwave flux (radiative forcing) is driven by the change in the total band absorptance, it follows that the radiative forcing exhibits a logarithmic dependence on the concentration:\n$$\n\\Delta F \\propto \\Delta A_{\\text{band}} \\propto \\ln(C_2) - \\ln(C_1) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_2}{C_1}\\right)\n$$\nThis relationship holds for gases like $\\text{CO}_2$ whose principal absorption bands are partially saturated at typical atmospheric concentrations.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of LGM-Preindustrial $\\text{CO}_2$ Forcing**\n\nThe problem provides the canonical parameterization for the global-mean, stratosphere-adjusted radiative forcing from $\\text{CO}_2$:\n$$\n\\Delta F_{\\text{CO}_2} = A \\,\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{C}{C_{0}}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $A = 5.35 \\, \\mathrm{W\\, m^{-2}}$, $C_0$ is the initial concentration, and $C$ is the final concentration. We are asked to compute the forcing change from the preindustrial period to the LGM. Thus, we set $C_0$ to the preindustrial value and $C$ to the LGM value.\n\nGiven values are:\n- Preindustrial concentration: $C_{0} = 278\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$\n- Last Glacial Maximum concentration: $C_{\\mathrm{LGM}} = 180\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$\n- Coefficient: $A = 5.35 \\, \\mathrm{W\\, m^{-2}}$\n\nThe forcing difference is calculated as:\n$$\n\\Delta F_{\\text{CO}_2} = 5.35 \\,\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{LGM}}}{C_{0}}\\right) = 5.35 \\,\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{180}{278}\\right)\n$$\nFirst, we evaluate the ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{180}{278} \\approx 0.647482014...\n$$\nNext, we take the natural logarithm of this ratio:\n$$\n\\ln(0.647482014...) \\approx -0.4346016...\n$$\nFinally, we multiply by the coefficient:\n$$\n\\Delta F_{\\text{CO}_2} = 5.35 \\times (-0.4346016...) \\approx -2.325418... \\, \\mathrm{W\\, m^{-2}}\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the lower $\\text{CO}_2$ concentration at the LGM compared to the preindustrial era resulted in a negative radiative forcing, i.e., a cooling effect.\n\nRounding the result to $3$ significant figures gives:\n$$\n\\Delta F_{\\text{CO}_2} \\approx -2.33 \\, \\mathrm{W\\, m^{-2}}\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Assumptions for Linear Addition of Forcings**\n\nThe practice of adding radiative forcings from different greenhouse gases (e.g., $\\Delta F_{\\text{total}} \\approx \\Delta F_{\\text{CO}_2} + \\Delta F_{\\text{CH}_4} + \\Delta F_{\\text{N}_2\\text{O}}$) is a useful approximation that relies on two main physical assumptions:\n\n1.  **Limited Spectral Overlap**: The primary assumption is that the absorption bands of the different gases in the infrared spectrum are largely distinct. If each gas absorbs in its own spectral \"window,\" its effect on the planetary radiation budget is independent of the others. In this case, their individual forcings can be summed linearly. However, in reality, there is some spectral overlap. For instance, the absorption bands of $\\text{N}_2\\text{O}$ overlap with those of both $\\text{CH}_4$ (around $7.7\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$) and $\\text{CO}_2$ (near $4.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and $17\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$). In regions of overlap, the gases compete for the same photons. If a spectral region is already partially opaque due to one gas, the absorptivity added by a second gas is less than if it were acting alone. This non-linear interaction means that a simple sum of individual forcings overestimates the total forcing. For benchmark and first-order calculations, the linear addition is often considered a sufficient approximation, but detailed radiative transfer models account for these overlaps, typically introducing cross-terms in forcing parameterizations.\n\n2.  **Independent Stratospheric Adjustments**: Radiative forcing is defined as \"stratosphere-adjusted,\" meaning the stratosphere is allowed to reach a new radiative equilibrium after the perturbation. This adjustment process involves temperature changes in the stratosphere that alter downwelling radiation to the troposphere. The linear additivity assumption tacitly presumes that the stratospheric temperature adjustment caused by one gas does not significantly modify the radiative forcing of another. For example, the strong stratospheric cooling caused by an increase in $\\text{CO}_2$ is assumed not to substantially change the radiative efficiency of added $\\text{CH}_4$. While there are some interferences (e.g., chemical effects, as $\\text{CH}_4$ oxidation produces stratospheric water vapor, another greenhouse gas), the assumption that these complex feedback mechanisms do not fundamentally invalidate the simple sum of adjusted forcings is a common and practical simplification in climate model intercomparisons.\n\nIn summary, linear additivity is a first-order approximation that is valid to the extent that spectral overlaps and interactions in the stratospheric adjustment process are secondary effects.",

It is deemed **valid**. The solution will be derived as requested.\n\nThe net shortwave flux absorbed at the surface, $Q_{\\mathrm{SW}}$, is defined by the principle of conservation of energy. It is the incoming (downwelling) shortwave flux, $S$, minus the outgoing (reflected) shortwave flux. The reflected shortwave flux is the fraction of the incoming flux that is reflected, which is given by the product of the albedo, $\\alpha$, and the downwelling flux, $S$.\n\nTherefore, the net absorbed shortwave flux is:\n$$\nQ_{\\mathrm{SW}} = S - \\alpha S\n$$\nThis can be factored as:\n$$\nQ_{\\mathrm{SW}} = S(1 - \\alpha)\n$$\n\nWe can apply this general relationship to the initial (\"old\") and final (\"new\") states of the surface.\n\nFor the initial state with albedo $\\alpha_1$:\n$$\nQ_{\\mathrm{SW,old}} = S(1 - \\alpha_{1})\n$$\n\nFor the final state with albedo $\\alpha_2$:\n$$\nQ_{\\mathrm{SW,new}} = S(1 - \\alpha_{2})\n$$\nThe problem states that the downwelling shortwave flux $S$ is unchanged by the perturbation.\n\nThe change in net shortwave flux absorbed at the surface, $\\Delta Q_{\\mathrm{SW}}$, is defined as the difference between the new and old fluxes:\n$$\n\\Delta Q_{\\mathrm{SW}} = Q_{\\mathrm{SW,new}} - Q_{\\mathrm{SW,old}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the fluxes:\n$$\n\\Delta Q_{\\mathrm{SW}} = S(1 - \\alpha_{2}) - S(1 - \\alpha_{1})\n$$\nDistributing the terms:\n$$\n\\Delta Q_{\\mathrm{SW}} = S - S\\alpha_{2} - S + S\\alpha_{1}\n$$\nThe terms involving $S$ cancel, leaving:\n$$\n\\Delta Q_{\\SW} = S\\alpha_{1} - S\\alpha_{2}\n$$\nFactoring out $S$, we arrive at the final derived expression for the change in absorbed shortwave radiation:\n$$\n\\Delta Q_{\\mathrm{SW}} = S(\\alpha_{1} - \\alpha_{2})\n$$\nThis expression shows that the change in absorbed flux is directly proportional to the incident flux and the difference between the initial and final albedos.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically using the given values:\n$S = 200\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$\n$\\alpha_{1} = 0.2$\n$\\alpha_{2} = 0.7$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$\n\\Delta Q_{\\mathrm{SW}} = (200\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}) \\times (0.2 - 0.7)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta Q_{\\mathrm{SW}} = (200\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}) \\times (-0.5)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta Q_{\\mathrm{SW}} = -100\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

The calculated $ \\Delta Q_{\\mathrm{SW}} $ is an instantaneous radiative forcing. In a fully coupled climate model, this forcing would cause a change in surface temperature, which in turn triggers feedbacks that modulate the final equilibrium temperature response. The most important feedbacks are:\n\n1.  **Planck Feedback**: This is a strong negative feedback. The initial cooling from the increased albedo ($ \\Delta Q_{\\mathrm{SW}} < 0 $) leads to a cooler surface. According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, a cooler surface emits less longwave radiation. This reduction in energy loss counteracts the initial cooling, thus stabilizing the climate. The sign of this feedback's effect on the surface energy budget is opposite to that of the initial forcing.\n\n2.  **Water Vapor Feedback**: This is a strong positive feedback. The cooler surface and lower troposphere reduce the saturation vapor pressure (as described by the Clausius-Clapeyron relation), leading to a decrease in atmospheric water vapor. Since water vapor is a powerful greenhouse gas, its reduction weakens the greenhouse effect, causing less downwelling longwave radiation and amplifying the initial cooling. The sign of this feedback's effect is the same as that of the initial forcing (it causes further cooling).\n\n3.  **Ice-Albedo Feedback**: This is a strong positive feedback, particularly relevant in a paleoclimate context. The initial cooling can promote the formation and expansion of snow and ice cover in surrounding regions. This further increases the regional surface albedo, reflecting more solar radiation and thus amplifying the initial cooling. The sign of this feedback's effect is the same as the initial forcing.\n\nThe interplay of these feedbacks, along with others like the lapse rate and cloud feedbacks, determines the overall sensitivity of the climate system and the magnitude of the final equilibrium temperature change.",

We now proceed with the numerical computation.\n\nFirst, we calculate the ensemble mean $\\bar{A}$ from the given model anomalies $\\{A_{i}\\}$:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{6} A_i = (-4.1) + (-3.6) + (-5.0) + (-4.7) + (-3.9) + (-4.4) = -25.7\\,\\mathrm{K} $$\n$$ \\bar{A} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{6} A_i = \\frac{-25.7}{6} \\approx -4.28333\\,\\mathrm{K} $$\n\nNext, we compute the intermodel spread $s$, as requested:\n$$ s^2 = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left(A_{i}-\\bar{A}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{1}{6} \\left[ (-4.1 - \\frac{-25.7}{6})^2 + \\dots + (-4.4 - \\frac{-25.7}{6})^2 \\right] $$\nAn equivalent formula is $s^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\sum A_i^2\\right) - \\bar{A}^2$.\n$$ \\sum A_i^2 = (-4.1)^2 + (-3.6)^2 + (-5.0)^2 + (-4.7)^2 + (-3.9)^2 + (-4.4)^2 $$\n$$ \\sum A_i^2 = 16.81 + 12.96 + 25.00 + 22.09 + 15.21 + 19.36 = 111.43\\,\\mathrm{K}^2 $$\n$$ s^2 = \\frac{111.43}{6} - \\left(\\frac{-25.7}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{111.43}{6} - \\frac{660.49}{36} = \\frac{668.58 - 660.49}{36} = \\frac{8.09}{36} \\approx 0.22472\\,\\mathrm{K}^2 $$\n$$ s = \\sqrt{\\frac{8.09}{36}} \\approx 0.47405\\,\\mathrm{K} $$\nThe intermodel spread is $s \\approx 0.47\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the total observational variance $\\sigma_o^2$:\n$$ \\sigma_o^2 = \\sigma_p^2 + \\sigma_v^2 = (0.6)^2 + (0.2)^2 = 0.36 + 0.04 = 0.40\\,\\mathrm{K}^2 $$\n\nNow we compute the MSE terms:\nThe model forecast error (bias) relative to the true signal is $\\bar{A}-T = \\frac{-25.7}{6} - (-4.3) = \\frac{-25.7 + 25.8}{6} = \\frac{0.1}{6} = \\frac{1}{60}\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n$$ \\mathrm{MSE}_{\\text{model}} = (\\bar{A}-T)^2 + \\sigma_o^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{60}\\right)^2 + 0.40 = \\frac{1}{3600} + 0.40 \\approx 0.000277... + 0.40 = 0.400277...\\,\\mathrm{K}^2 $$\nThe reference forecast has a squared bias of $T^2$:\n$$ T^2 = (-4.3)^2 = 18.49\\,\\mathrm{K}^2 $$\n$$ \\mathrm{MSE}_{\\text{ref}} = T^2 + \\sigma_o^2 = 18.49 + 0.40 = 18.89\\,\\mathrm{K}^2 $$\n\nFinally, we compute the skill score $S$:\n$$ S = 1 - \\frac{\\mathrm{MSE}_{\\text{model}}}{\\mathrm{MSE}_{\\text{ref}}} = 1 - \\frac{0.400277...}{18.89} \\approx 1 - 0.021190... = 0.978809... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the skill score is $S \\approx 0.9788$.\n\nLastly, we evaluate the ensemble’s robustness and check for outliers.\n1.  **Sign Agreement**: The proxy-reconstructed anomaly is $T=-4.3\\,\\mathrm{K}$, indicating significant cooling. All six model anomalies are also negative, ranging from $-3.6\\,\\mathrm{K}$ to $-5.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$. The ensemble mean $\\bar{A} \\approx -4.28\\,\\mathrm{K}$ is also negative. There is unanimous agreement on the sign of the change (cooling), which is a sign of a robust qualitative result.\n2.  **Outliers**: We assess outliers by standardizing the deviations of each model from the ensemble mean, $(A_i - \\bar{A}) / s$.\n    The deviations $(A_i - \\bar{A})$ in units of $\\mathrm{K}$ are approximately $\\{0.183, 0.683, -0.717, -0.417, 0.383, -0.117\\}$. With $s \\approx 0.474\\,\\mathrm{K}$, the standardized deviations are approximately $\\{0.39, 1.44, -1.51, -0.88, 0.81, -0.25\\}$. All values lie between $-1.6$ and $+1.6$. Since none of these values exceed a magnitude of $2$, there are no statistical outliers within the ensemble. The models show a consistent spread around their mean.\n3.  **Consistency with Observation**: The error of the ensemble mean is $\\bar{A} - T \\approx 0.0167\\,\\mathrm{K}$. The standard deviation of the observational error is $\\sigma_o = \\sqrt{0.40} \\approx 0.632\\,\\mathrm{K}$. The ensemble mean is extremely close to the true value, with a difference of $|\\bar{A} - T|/\\sigma_o \\approx 0.0167/0.632 \\approx 0.026$. This indicates that the ensemble mean is highly consistent with the proxy-based benchmark, well within its uncertainty.\n\nThe high skill score $S \\approx 0.98$ reflects this extremely small model bias ($\\bar{A}-T$) compared to the bias of the reference \"no-change\" forecast ($0-T$). The ensemble provides a highly skillful and robust estimate of the regional LGM cooling.",
