A solution will be provided.\n\n---\n\n### Task 1: Derivation of the Bulk Aerodynamic Formula for Latent Heat Flux\n\nThe derivation begins with the conservation of a scalar quantity, in this case, water vapor, represented by specific humidity $q$. Using Reynolds decomposition, any instantaneous quantity can be written as the sum of a mean component (overbar) and a turbulent fluctuation (prime), e.g., $w = \\bar{w} + w'$ and $q = \\bar{q} + q'$. For the assumed steady-state ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0$) and horizontally homogeneous ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} = 0$) conditions, and assuming zero mean vertical velocity ($\\bar{w} = 0$), the conservation equation for mean specific humidity simplifies to show that the vertical divergence of the turbulent flux is zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial (\\overline{w'q'})}{\\partial z} = 0\n$$\nThis implies that the turbulent kinematic flux of moisture, $E = \\overline{w'q'}$, is constant with height in the atmospheric surface layer.\n\nThe turbulent flux–gradient hypothesis (K-theory) relates this flux to the mean gradient of specific humidity:\n$$\nE = \\overline{w'q'} = -K_E \\frac{d\\bar{q}}{dz}\n$$\nwhere $K_E$ is the eddy diffusivity for water vapor. The negative sign indicates that the flux is directed down the gradient (i.e., from high to low concentration).\n\nThis equation can be integrated from the surface to the reference height $z_r = 10\\,$ m. However, the problem asks for a bulk aerodynamic expression, which is a parameterization of the integrated result of this turbulent transfer. The bulk formula directly relates the flux to the mean quantities at the reference height and the surface. The mass flux of water vapor, $F_q$ (in units of $\\text{kg m}^{-2} \\text{s}^{-1}$), is given by:\n$$\nF_q = \\rho_a C_E U (q_s - q_a)\n$$\nHere, $\\rho_a$ is the density of air, $U$ is the wind speed at the reference height, $(q_s - q_a)$ is the difference in specific humidity between the sea surface and the air at the reference height, and $C_E$ is the dimensionless bulk exchange coefficient for water vapor (also known as the Dalton number). This expression directly parameterizes the complex turbulent transport into a simple product of mean state variables.\n\nThe latent heat flux, $F_E$ (in units of $\\text{W m}^{-2}$ or $\\text{J s}^{-1} \\text{m}^{-2}$), is the energy flux associated with the phase change of water. It is obtained by multiplying the mass flux of water vapor, $F_q$, by the latent heat of vaporization, $L_v$:\n$$\nF_E = L_v F_q\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $F_q$, we arrive at the bulk aerodynamic formula for the latent heat flux:\n$$\nF_E = \\rho_a L_v C_E U (q_s - q_a)\n$$\nThis is the required expression. It is valid under the neutral stability conditions specified in the problem.\n\n### Task 2: Computation of the Latent Heat Flux ($F_E$)\n\nUsing the derived expression and the given values:\n- $\\rho_a = 1.225 \\, \\text{kg m}^{-3}$\n- $L_v = 2.5 \\times 10^{6} \\, \\text{J kg}^{-1}$\n- $C_E = 1.2 \\times 10^{-3}$\n- $U = 8 \\, \\text{m s}^{-1}$\n- $q_s = 0.017 \\, \\text{kg kg}^{-1}$\n- $q_a = 0.012 \\, \\text{kg kg}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, calculate the specific humidity difference:\n$$\nq_s - q_a = 0.017 - 0.012 = 0.005\n$$\nNow, substitute all values into the formula for $F_E$:\n$$\nF_E = (1.225) \\times (2.5 \\times 10^{6}) \\times (1.2 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times (8) \\times (0.005)\n$$\n$$\nF_E = (1.225 \\times 2.5 \\times 1.2 \\times 8 \\times 0.005) \\times (10^{6} \\times 10^{-3})\n$$\n$$\nF_E = (29.4 \\times 0.005) \\times 10^{3}\n$$\n$$\nF_E = 0.147 \\times 10^{3}\n$$\n$$\nF_E = 147.0 \\, \\text{W m}^{-2}\n$$\nThe latent heat flux is $147.0 \\, \\text{W m}^{-2}$, rounded to four significant figures.\n\n### Task 3: Evaluation of Wind-Speed Sensitivity ($S_U$)\n\nThe wind-speed sensitivity, $S_U$, is defined as the partial derivative of the latent heat flux, $F_E$, with respect to the wind speed, $U$, holding all other parameters constant:\n$$\nS_U = \\frac{\\partial F_E}{\\partial U}\n$$\nWe apply this operator to the derived expression for $F_E$:\n$$\nS_U = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial U} \\left[ \\rho_a L_v C_E U (q_s - q_a) \\right]\n$$\nSince $\\rho_a$, $L_v$, $C_E$, $q_s$, and $q_a$ are held constant, the expression for $F_E$ is linear in $U$. The derivative is therefore the collection of constant coefficients multiplying $U$:\n$$\nS_U = \\rho_a L_v C_E (q_s - q_a)\n$$\nThis expression can also be seen as $F_E / U$. We can now compute the numerical value for $S_U$:\n$$\nS_U = (1.225) \\times (2.5 \\times 10^{6}) \\times (1.2 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times (0.017 - 0.012)\n$$\n$$\nS_U = (1.225) \\times (2.5 \\times 10^{6}) \\times (1.2 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times (0.005)\n$$\n$$\nS_U = (1.225 \\times 2.5 \\times 1.2 \\times 0.005) \\times (10^{6} \\times 10^{-3})\n$$\n$$\nS_U = (0.018375) \\times 10^{3}\n$$\n$$\nS_U = 18.375 \\, \\text{W m}^{-2} \\, (\\text{m s}^{-1})^{-1}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required by the problem:\n$$\nS_U = 18.38 \\, \\text{W m}^{-2} \\, (\\text{m s}^{-1})^{-1}\n$$\nThis is the final answer requested.",

            "problem": "You are tasked with formalizing and computing the sensitivity of an aquaplanet's surface temperature response to changes in ocean mixed-layer depth, from first principles. Consider an aquaplanet represented by a slab ocean of uniform mixed-layer depth $H_m$ that exchanges energy with the atmosphere. The planet has no orbital seasons (no obliquity and constant insolation), so any seasonal-like variability must arise from an imposed, idealized periodic forcing. Assume the following physical setup:\n\n- The surface mixed layer has heat capacity per unit area $C = \\rho_w c_p H_m$, where $\\rho_w$ is the seawater density, $c_p$ is the specific heat capacity of seawater at constant pressure, and $H_m$ is the mixed-layer depth.\n- The surface energy balance is a first-order linear system: the tendency of surface temperature $T(t)$ is controlled by external forcing and a linear radiative feedback. The external forcing can represent a hypothetical \"seasonal-like\" cycle or synoptic-scale variability, each idealized as a sinusoidal heat flux with angular frequency $\\omega$ and amplitude $F_0$. The radiative feedback is proportional to temperature with feedback parameter $\\lambda$.\n- The governing equation for the mixed-layer temperature follows energy conservation and linear feedback: the rate of change of mixed-layer energy equals the net surface flux minus the feedback term.\n\nUsing only these foundations, derive from first principles the normalized amplitude ratio of the surface temperature response to a sinusoidal heat-flux forcing relative to the zero-inertia limit. Then implement a program to evaluate this normalized ratio for specified test cases. The normalized ratio is defined as the ratio of the steady-state amplitude of $T(t)$ under finite $H_m$ to the amplitude under the limit $H_m \\to 0$. This ratio is unitless by construction.\n\nAdopt the following scientifically realistic parameter values:\n- Seawater density $\\rho_w = 1025 \\, \\text{kg m}^{-3}$,\n- Seawater specific heat capacity $c_p = 3990 \\, \\text{J kg}^{-1} \\text{K}^{-1}$,\n- Climate feedback parameter $\\lambda = 1.2 \\, \\text{W m}^{-2} \\text{K}^{-1}$.\n\nDefine angular frequency in radians per second.

            "solution": "The user has provided a well-posed problem statement from the field of physical oceanography and climate dynamics. The problem is scientifically grounded in the first law of thermodynamics (energy conservation) and uses a standard idealization, the zero-dimensional energy balance model (EBM) for a slab ocean. All parameters are provided and are physically realistic. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe task is to derive the normalized amplitude ratio of the surface temperature response to a sinusoidal forcing. This ratio is defined as the amplitude for a finite mixed-layer depth $H_m$ divided by the amplitude in the zero-inertia limit ($H_m \\to 0$).\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the Governing Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)**\n\nThe problem is governed by the principle of energy conservation for the ocean mixed layer. The rate of change of energy stored in the mixed layer per unit area is equal to the net energy flux into the surface.\n\nThe energy stored per unit area, $E$, is given by the product of the heat capacity per unit area, $C$, and the surface temperature, $T(t)$.\n$$E = C T(t)$$\nThe heat capacity per unit area $C$ is defined as:\n$$C = \\rho_w c_p H_m$$\nwhere $\\rho_w$ is the seawater density, $c_p$ is the specific heat capacity of seawater, and $H_m$ is the mixed-layer depth.\n\nThe rate of change of this energy is:\n$$\\frac{dE}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(C T(t)) = C \\frac{dT}{dt} = \\rho_w c_p H_m \\frac{dT}{dt}$$\n\nThe net energy flux into the surface is the sum of the external forcing and the radiative feedback.\nThe external forcing is a sinusoidal heat flux, which we can represent in complex form as $F(t) = F_0 e^{i\\omega t}$, where $F_0$ is the real amplitude and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency.\nThe radiative feedback is a linear restoring term, representing outgoing longwave radiation. It is proportional to the surface temperature, $-\\lambda T(t)$, where $\\lambda$ is the climate feedback parameter. The negative sign indicates that a positive temperature anomaly leads to an energy loss from the system.\n\nEquating the rate of change of energy with the net flux, we obtain the governing ODE:\n$$\\rho_w c_p H_m \\frac{dT}{dt} = F_0 e^{i\\omega t} - \\lambda T(t)$$\nRearranging this into the standard form for a first-order linear ODE gives:\n$$\\rho_w c_p H_m \\frac{dT}{dt} + \\lambda T(t) = F_0 e^{i\\omega t}$$\n\n**Step 2: Solve for the Steady-State Amplitude**\n\nWe seek the steady-state (or particular) solution to this forced ODE. The transient (homogeneous) part of the solution decays over time. We assume a solution of the form $T(t) = \\hat{T} e^{i\\omega t}$, where $\\hat{T}$ is the complex amplitude of the temperature response.\n\nThe derivative is $\\frac{dT}{dt} = i\\omega \\hat{T} e^{i\\omega t}$. Substituting the assumed solution and its derivative into the ODE:\n$$\\rho_w c_p H_m (i\\omega \\hat{T} e^{i\\omega t}) + \\lambda (\\hat{T} e^{i\\omega t}) = F_0 e^{i\\omega t}$$\nWe can divide through by the time-dependent term $e^{i\\omega t}$:\n$$i\\omega \\rho_w c_p H_m \\hat{T} + \\lambda \\hat{T} = F_0$$\nNow, we solve for the complex amplitude $\\hat{T}$:\n$$\\hat{T} ( \\lambda + i\\omega \\rho_w c_p H_m ) = F_0$$\n$$\\hat{T} = \\frac{F_0}{\\lambda + i\\omega \\rho_w c_p H_m}$$\n\nThe physical amplitude of the temperature oscillation, denoted $A_T$, is the magnitude (or modulus) of the complex amplitude $\\hat{T}$:\n$$A_T = |\\hat{T}| = \\left| \\frac{F_0}{\\lambda + i\\omega \\rho_w c_p H_m} \\right| = \\frac{|F_0|}{|\\lambda + i\\omega \\rho_w c_p H_m|}$$\nSince $F_0$ is a real, positive amplitude, $|F_0| = F_0$. The magnitude of the complex denominator is $\\sqrt{(\\text{Re})^2 + (\\text{Im})^2}$.\n$$A_T(H_m, \\omega) = \\frac{F_0}{\\sqrt{\\lambda^2 + (\\omega \\rho_w c_p H_m)^2}}$$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Amplitude in the Zero-Inertia Limit**\n\nThe problem asks for normalization with respect to the \"zero-inertia limit,\" which corresponds to the mixed-layer depth approaching zero, $H_m \\to 0$. Let's denote the amplitude in this limit as $A_{T,0}$.\n$$A_{T,0}(\\omega) = \\lim_{H_m \\to 0} A_T(H_m, \\omega) = \\lim_{H_m \\to 0} \\frac{F_0}{\\sqrt{\\lambda^2 + (\\omega \\rho_w c_p H_m)^2}}$$\nAs $H_m \\to 0$, the term $(\\omega \\rho_w c_p H_m)^2 \\to 0$. Therefore, the limit is:\n$$A_{T,0} = \\frac{F_0}{\\sqrt{\\lambda^2 + 0}} = \\frac{F_0}{\\lambda}$$\nThis result is physically intuitive: with zero thermal inertia, the surface temperature is in instantaneous equilibrium with the forcing, so the radiative feedback flux $\\lambda T$ must balance the forcing flux.\n\n**Step 4: Derive the Normalized Amplitude Ratio**\n\nThe normalized amplitude ratio, $G$, is defined as the ratio of the finite-depth amplitude $A_T$ to the zero-inertia amplitude $A_{T,0}$.\n$$G(H_m, \\omega) = \\frac{A_T(H_m, \\omega)}{A_{T,0}}$$\n$$G(H_m, \\omega) = \\frac{\\frac{F_0}{\\sqrt{\\lambda^2 + (\\omega \\rho_w c_p H_m)^2}}}{\\frac{F_0}{\\lambda}}$$\nThe forcing amplitude $F_0$ cancels out:\n$$G(H_m, \\omega) = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\sqrt{\\lambda^2 + (\\omega \\rho_w c_p H_m)^2}}$$\nThis expression can be simplified by factoring $\\lambda$ out of the square root:\n$$G(H_m, \\omega) = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\lambda \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{(\\omega \\rho_w c_p H_m)^2}{\\lambda^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{\\omega \\rho_w c_p H_m}{\\lambda}\\right)^2}}$$\nThis is the final formula for the normalized amplitude ratio. It describes the behavior of a low-pass filter, where the response is attenuated at higher frequencies $\\omega$ or for larger thermal inertia (proportional to $H_m$).\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Zero-Frequency Case**\n\nFor the special case of zero frequency, $\\omega = 0$:\n$$G(H_m, 0) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{0 \\cdot \\rho_w c_p H_m}{\\lambda}\\right)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+0}} = 1$$\nThis means that for a constant forcing ($\\omega = 0$), the steady-state temperature response is independent of the mixed-layer heat capacity. The final equilibrium is determined solely by the feedback parameter $\\lambda$. Therefore, the normalized ratio is always $1$. The problem asks for this value for $H_m = 50\\,\\mathrm{m}$, which will be $1.0$.\n\n**Step 6: Implementation Plan**\n\nThe program will implement the derived formula $G(H_m, \\omega)$ using the provided physical constants and test cases.\n- Constants: $\\rho_w = 1025\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$, $c_p = 3990\\,\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$, $\\lambda = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}}$.\n- Conversion from period $P$ in days to angular frequency $\\omega$: $\\omega = 2\\pi / (P \\times 86400)$.\n- The program will loop through the specified $H_m$ values ($10$, $25$, $50$, $100\\,\\mathrm{m}$) and calculate $G$ for $P_\\mathrm{syn} = 4\\,\\mathrm{days}$ and $P_\\mathrm{seas} = 365\\,\\mathrm{days}$.\n- Finally, it will append the result for the $\\omega = 0$ case for $H_m=50\\,\\mathrm{m}$, which is $1.0$.\n- All results will be formatted to six decimal places.",

You will apply the fundamental principle of mass conservation to the atmospheric water vapor budget, where precipitation ($P$) can be inferred from evaporation ($E$), moisture storage ($\\partial_t W$), and moisture flux divergence ($\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{F}_q$). By numerically implementing this budget, you will calculate precipitation patterns to locate the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), gaining practical skills in how model output is analyzed to understand the structure of the global circulation .",

            "problem": "Consider an idealized aquaplanet, that is, a planet completely covered by ocean with zonally uniform conditions, used to study large-scale atmospheric behavior in Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) and climate modeling. The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) location can be inferred from the latitude of maximum column-integrated precipitation. Your task is to derive, implement, and apply a diagnostic calculation of precipitation based on the column-integrated moisture budget and then infer the ITCZ latitude under imposed Sea Surface Temperature (SST) changes. Angles must be expressed in degrees, and any internal computation that uses trigonometric functions must convert to radians. The final program must produce a single line of output containing the inferred ITCZ latitudes for the provided test suite, in degrees, as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. The program must be self-contained and must not read any external input.\n\nStart from a fundamental base: the conservation of water vapor mass under the hydrostatic and shallow-atmosphere approximations. Over a vertical column, the integral of water vapor mass per unit area, denoted by $W$, obeys a local conservation law with sources and sinks due to evaporation and precipitation and horizontal transport by the moisture flux. The column moisture flux vector is denoted by $\\mathbf{F}_q$. The diagnostic precipitation is computed by combining evaporation, storage tendency, and the spherical divergence of the column moisture flux. Derive the diagnostic expression for precipitation using this conservation principle, and then implement it numerically for zonally symmetric conditions on a sphere.\n\nAssumptions and definitions:\n- Define the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) as the latitude $\\phi$ where the diagnosed precipitation attains its maximum value in the zonal mean.\n- Define the Sea Surface Temperature (SST). Let $T_s(\\phi)$ be the SST as a function of latitude $\\phi$.\n- Define Relative Humidity (RH). Let $RH_{10}(\\phi)$ be the near-surface relative humidity and $RH_c(\\phi)$ be the column relative humidity.\n- Let $p_s$ be the surface pressure, $g$ be gravitational acceleration, $a$ be the Earth radius, $R_d$ be the specific gas constant for dry air, $R_v$ be the specific gas constant for water vapor, $L_v$ be the latent heat of vaporization, and $C_E$ be the bulk transfer coefficient for evaporation.\n- Use the following saturation vapor pressure formulation: $$e_s(T) = e_0 \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{L_v}{R_v}\\left(\\frac{1}{T_0} - \\frac{1}{T}\\right)\\right),$$ where $e_0$ is the reference saturation vapor pressure at $T_0$.\n- The saturation specific humidity at the surface is $$q_s(T_s) = \\epsilon \\frac{e_s(T_s)}{p_s},$$ with $\\epsilon = R_d/R_v$.\n- Assume near-surface air temperature equals the SST, i.e., $T_a(\\phi) = T_s(\\phi)$, and near-surface air density is $$\\rho_a(\\phi) = \\frac{p_s}{R_d T_a(\\phi)}.$$\n- Parameterize column-integrated water vapor mass per unit area (precipitable water) by assuming vertically uniform specific humidity proportional to $RH_c$: $$W(\\phi) = RH_c(\\phi)\\, q_s\\!\\left(T_s(\\phi)\\right)\\, \\frac{p_s}{g}.$$\n- Parameterize evaporation using a standard bulk aerodynamic formula: $$E(\\phi) = \\rho_a(\\phi)\\, C_E\\, U_{10}(\\phi)\\,\\left(q_s\\!\\left(T_s(\\phi)\\right) - q_a(\\phi)\\right),$$ with near-surface specific humidity $q_a(\\phi) = RH_{10}(\\phi)\\, q_s\\!\\left(T_s(\\phi)\\right)$ and $U_{10}(\\phi)$ the $10$ meter wind speed magnitude.\n- Parameterize the column moisture flux as purely meridional due to zonal symmetry: $$\\mathbf{F}_q(\\phi) = \\left(0,\\, F_\\phi(\\phi)\\right),\\quad F_\\phi(\\phi) = v(\\phi)\\, W(\\phi),$$ where $v(\\phi)$ is the column-mean meridional wind speed.\n- On the sphere, the divergence of a purely meridional flux for zonal symmetry is $$\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{F}_q(\\phi) = \\frac{1}{a\\cos\\phi}\\, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}\\big(F_\\phi(\\phi)\\cos\\phi\\big),$$ where $\\phi$ is expressed in radians in the derivative.\n\nGrid and units:\n- Use a latitude grid $\\phi_i$ from $-87.5$ degrees to $+87.5$ degrees inclusive, spaced by $5$ degrees (do not include the poles), i.e., $\\phi_i \\in \\{-87.5, -82.5, \\dots, 82.5, 87.5\\}$.\n- For internal computations involving trigonometric functions and spherical derivatives, convert degrees to radians.\n- The diagnosed precipitation should be internally computed in $\\text{kg m}^{-2} \\text{s}^{-1}$ and then converted to $\\text{mm/day}$ using the identity that $1$ $\\mathrm{kg\\, m^{-2}} = 1$ $\\mathrm{mm}$ of liquid water, so multiply by $86400$ to convert from $\\text{kg m}^{-2} \\text{s}^{-1}$ to $\\text{mm/day}$.\n- Angles must be reported in degrees. The final output requires latitudes in degrees.\n\nConstants:\n- Use $a = 6.371\\times 10^6 \\, \\text{m}$, $g = 9.81 \\, \\text{m s}^{-2}$, $p_s = 10^5 \\, \\text{Pa}$, $R_d = 287 \\, \\text{J kg}^{-1} \\text{K}^{-1}$, $R_v = 461 \\, \\text{J kg}^{-1} \\text{K}^{-1}$, $L_v = 2.5\\times 10^6 \\, \\text{J kg}^{-1}$, $e_0 = 610.78 \\, \\text{Pa}$, $T_0 = 273.15 \\, \\text{K}$, $C_E = 1.2\\times 10^{-3}$ (dimensionless).\n\nNumerical method:\n- Implement the spherical divergence using a second-order centered finite difference for interior grid points and first-order one-sided finite differences at the domain boundaries. Let $\\Delta \\phi$ be the latitude spacing in radians. For interior points $i$, compute $$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}(F_\\phi\\cos\\phi)\\bigg|_i \\approx \\frac{(F_\\phi\\cos\\phi)_{i+1} - (F_\\phi\\cos\\phi)_{i-1}}{2\\,\\Delta \\phi}.$$ At the boundaries, use forward or backward differences.\n- Compute the diagnosed precipitation from the moisture budget and determine the latitude $\\phi$ where it is maximized.\n\nTest suite:\nProvide four cases to test the computation and ITCZ inference. In all cases, angles in trigonometric functions are handled in radians internally, but outputs must be latitudes in degrees.\n- Case $1$ (Control aquaplanet): \n  - $T_s(\\phi) = 300 - 20\\, \\sin^2\\!\\phi$ (with $\\phi$ in radians in the sine), in K.\n  - $U_{10}(\\phi) = 8$ $\\text{m s}^{-1}$ (constant).\n  - $RH_{10}(\\phi) = 0.8$ (constant).\n  - $RH_c(\\phi) = \\min\\!\\big(\\max\\!\\big(0.6 + 0.2 \\cos\\phi,\\, 0.3\\big),\\, 0.95\\big)$ (clamped to the interval $[0.3, 0.95]$).\n  - $v(\\phi) = 2\\, \\sin(2\\phi)$ $\\text{m s}^{-1}$.\n  - $\\partial_t W(\\phi) = 0$ $\\text{kg m}^{-2} \\text{s}^{-1}$.\n- Case $2$ (Northern Hemisphere warming): Same as Case $1$, except\n  - $T_s(\\phi) \\leftarrow T_s(\\phi) + \\Delta_H\\, \\tanh\\!\\left(\\frac{\\phi}{\\phi_w}\\right)$,\n  - with $\\Delta_H = 2$ $\\mathrm{K}$ and $\\phi_w = 10$ degrees (convert $\\phi_w$ to radians for the $\\tanh$ argument).\n- Case $3$ (Southern Hemisphere warming and zero meridional transport): Same as Case $1$, except\n  - $T_s(\\phi) \\leftarrow T_s(\\phi) - \\Delta_H\\, \\tanh\\!\\left(\\frac{\\phi}{\\phi_w}\\right)$,\n  - with $\\Delta_H = 2$ $\\mathrm{K}$ and $\\phi_w = 10$ degrees (convert to radians),\n  - and $v(\\phi) = 0$ $\\mathrm{m\\, s^{-1}}$ for all $\\phi$.\n- Case $4$ (Northern Hemisphere warming with transient moistening): Same as Case $2$, except\n  - $\\partial_t W(\\phi) = A\\, \\exp\\!\\big(-(\\phi/\\sigma)^2\\big)$ $\\text{kg m}^{-2} \\text{s}^{-1}$,\n  - with $A = 1\\times 10^{-5}$ $\\text{kg m}^{-2} \\text{s}^{-1}$ and $\\sigma = 15$ degrees (convert $\\sigma$ to radians in the exponent).\n\nRequired final output:\n- For each case, compute the diagnosed precipitation field in $\\mathrm{mm/day}$ and then determine the latitude of its global maximum (the ITCZ latitude). Report these four latitudes as floats in degrees.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (e.g., $[\\text{result}_1,\\text{result}_2,\\text{result}_3,\\text{result}_4]$).\n\nScientific realism constraints:\n- All constants and parameterizations must be physically plausible.\n- The algorithm must correctly handle unit conversions and spherical geometry.\n- The discretization must be stable and appropriate for the given grid.\n\nNote: The final reported latitudes must be in degrees. The internal precipitation computation must use $\\text{kg m}^{-2} \\text{s}^{-1}$ and then be converted to $\\text{mm/day}$ for diagnostic purposes, but the only required output is the ITCZ latitudes in degrees for the four test cases.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically examined and is determined to be **valid**. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of atmospheric physics, specifically the conservation of water vapor mass. The problem is well-posed, providing a complete and consistent set of definitions, constants, and parameterizations required to derive and implement a unique solution. The numerical methods and boundary conditions are explicitly specified, and the context of an idealized aquaplanet simulation is standard practice in climate science. The problem is a non-trivial but solvable exercise in computational atmospheric science.\n\nThe core task is to determine the latitude of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), defined as the latitude of maximum precipitation, under various climate scenarios on an aquaplanet. This requires deriving and numerically solving the column-integrated moisture budget equation for diagnostic precipitation.\n\nThe vertically integrated conservation law for water vapor mass $W$ (in units of $\\mathrm{kg\\, m^{-2}}$) is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{F}_q = E - P\n$$\nwhere $\\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial t}$ is the storage tendency of water vapor, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{F}_q$ is the divergence of the vertically integrated moisture flux, $E$ is the surface evaporation rate, and $P$ is the precipitation rate. All terms are expressed in units of $\\mathrm{kg\\, m^{-2}\\, s^{-1}}$.\n\nTo find the diagnostic precipitation $P$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$\nP(\\phi) = E(\\phi) - \\frac{\\partial W(\\phi)}{\\partial t} - \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{F}_q(\\phi)\n$$\nThe problem is zonally symmetric, so all quantities are functions of latitude $\\phi$ only. We must calculate each term on the right-hand side using the provided parameterizations.\n\nThe solution proceeds in the following steps:\n1.  **Grid Setup**: A latitude grid $\\phi_i$ is established from $-87.5^\\circ$ to $+87.5^\\circ$ with a spacing of $\\Delta\\phi = 5^\\circ$. For all calculations, this grid is converted to radians.\n\n2.  **Calculation of Thermodynamic Quantities**: We first compute several latitude-dependent thermodynamic variables that are prerequisites for the budget terms.\n    -   The Sea Surface Temperature $T_s(\\phi)$ is defined for each test case. Near-surface air temperature is assumed equal, $T_a(\\phi) = T_s(\\phi)$.\n    -   The saturation vapor pressure $e_s(T)$ at temperature $T$ is given by the Clausius-Clapeyron relation:\n        $$e_s(T) = e_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{L_v}{R_v}\\left(\\frac{1}{T_0} - \\frac{1}{T}\\right)\\right)$$\n        where $e_0 = 610.78 \\, \\mathrm{Pa}$ is the reference saturation vapor pressure at $T_0 = 273.15 \\, \\mathrm{K}$. $L_v=2.5 \\times 10^6 \\, \\mathrm{J\\, kg^{-1}}$ is the latent heat of vaporization, and $R_v=461 \\, \\mathrm{J\\, kg^{-1}\\, K^{-1}}$ is the specific gas constant for water vapor.\n    -   The saturation specific humidity at the surface is then calculated as:\n        $$q_s(\\phi) = \\epsilon \\frac{e_s(T_s(\\phi))}{p_s}$$\n        where $\\epsilon = R_d/R_v \\approx 0.622$ is the ratio of gas constants for dry air ($R_d = 287 \\, \\mathrm{J\\, kg^{-1}\\, K^{-1}}$) and water vapor, and $p_s = 10^5 \\, \\mathrm{Pa}$ is the surface pressure.\n\n3.  **Calculation of Budget Terms**:\n    -   **Evaporation ($E$)**: The surface evaporation flux is parameterized using a bulk aerodynamic formula:\n        $$E(\\phi) = \\rho_a(\\phi)\\, C_E\\, U_{10}(\\phi)\\,\\left(q_s(\\phi) - q_a(\\phi)\\right)$$\n        Here, $C_E = 1.2 \\times 10^{-3}$ is the dimensionless bulk transfer coefficient, and $U_{10}(\\phi)$ is the prescribed near-surface wind speed. The near-surface air density is $\\rho_a(\\phi) = p_s / (R_d T_a(\\phi))$, and the near-surface specific humidity is $q_a(\\phi) = RH_{10}(\\phi)\\, q_s(\\phi)$, where $RH_{10}(\\phi)$ is the prescribed near-surface relative humidity.\n    -   **Storage Tendency ($\\partial_t W$)**: The term $\\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial t}$ is explicitly prescribed for each case. For the first $3$ cases, it is zero. For the fourth case, it is a non-zero function of latitude.\n    -   **Moisture Flux Divergence ($\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{F}_q$)**: This term requires several steps.\n        -   First, the column-integrated water vapor (precipitable water) $W$ is parameterized as:\n            $$W(\\phi) = RH_c(\\phi)\\, q_s(\\phi)\\, \\frac{p_s}{g}$$\n            where $RH_c(\\phi)$ is the prescribed column relative humidity and $g = 9.81 \\, \\mathrm{m\\, s^{-2}}$ is the acceleration due to gravity.\n        -   Due to zonal symmetry, the moisture flux is purely meridional, $\\mathbf{F}_q(\\phi) = (0, F_\\phi(\\phi))$, where the meridional component is:\n            $$F_\\phi(\\phi) = v(\\phi)\\, W(\\phi)$$\n            with $v(\\phi)$ being the prescribed column-mean meridional wind.\n        -   The divergence of this flux on a sphere is:\n            $$\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{F}_q(\\phi) = \\frac{1}{a\\cos\\phi}\\, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}\\left(F_\\phi(\\phi)\\cos\\phi\\right)$$\n            where $a = 6.371 \\times 10^6 \\, \\mathrm{m}$ is the Earth's radius and $\\phi$ is in radians.\n        -   The derivative $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}(F_\\phi\\cos\\phi)$ is computed numerically using finite differences on the discrete grid. Let $Y_i = (F_\\phi \\cos\\phi)_i$ at grid point $i$.\n            -   For interior points ($i=1, \\dots, N-2$): A $2^{nd}$-order centered difference is used:\n                $$\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial\\phi}\\bigg|_i \\approx \\frac{Y_{i+1} - Y_{i-1}}{2\\,\\Delta \\phi}$$\n            -   For the southern boundary ($i=0$): A $1^{st}$-order forward difference is used:\n                $$\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial\\phi}\\bigg|_0 \\approx \\frac{Y_1 - Y_0}{\\Delta \\phi}$$\n            -   For the northern boundary ($i=N-1$): A $1^{st}$-order backward difference is used:\n                $$\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial\\phi}\\bigg|_{N-1} \\approx \\frac{Y_{N-1} - Y_{N-2}}{\\Delta \\phi}$$\n            The resulting vector of derivatives is then divided by $a\\cos\\phi_i$ to get the divergence.\n\n4.  **Final Precipitation and ITCZ Location**:\n    -   The precipitation $P(\\phi_i)$ is calculated at each grid point by substituting the computed terms $E(\\phi_i)$, $\\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial t}(\\phi_i)$, and $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{F}_q(\\phi_i)$ into the budget equation.\n    -   The ITCZ latitude is identified by finding the grid point $i_{max}$ where $P(\\phi_{i_{max}})$ is the maximum value in the array $P$. The latitude in degrees corresponding to this index, $\\phi_{deg}[i_{max}]$, is the final result for that test case.\n\nThis procedure is applied to each of the $4$ test cases, which vary the functions for $T_s(\\phi)$, $v(\\phi)$, and $\\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial t}(\\phi)$ to simulate different climatic states.",
