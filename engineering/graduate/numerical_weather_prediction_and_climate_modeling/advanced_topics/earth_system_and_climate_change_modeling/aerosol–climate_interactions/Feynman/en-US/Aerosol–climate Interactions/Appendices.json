The aerosol mass burden in the box, denoted by $B(t)$, evolves under a constant source due to emissions and first-order losses due to dry deposition and wet scavenging. Assume the following physically justified, widely used representations:\n- Conservation of mass for the aerosol burden states that the time rate of change of $B(t)$ equals sources minus sinks.\n- For sufficiently dilute aerosol and linear removal physics, each sink is proportional to $B(t)$ with a nonnegative, constant rate coefficient.\n- Emissions provide a constant source to the box.\n\nLet $E$ be the constant emission rate (mass per unit time), $\\lambda_{d}$ the dry deposition rate coefficient (per unit time), and $\\lambda_{w}$ the wet scavenging rate coefficient (per unit time). Starting from conservation of mass and the linearity of first-order sinks, derive the analytic expressions for:\n1) the steady-state aerosol burden $B^{\\ast}$, and\n2) the e-folding lifetime $\\tau$ that characterizes the exponential relaxation of $B(t)$ toward $B^{\\ast}$.\n\nThen, using the parameter values $E = 0.85$ Tg day$^{-1}$, $\\lambda_{d} = 0.12$ day$^{-1}$, and $\\lambda_{w} = 0.21$ day$^{-1}$, compute numerical values for $B^{\\ast}$ and $\\tau$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It presents a standard atmospheric science problem involving a box model for an aerosol species, based on the fundamental principle of mass conservation. The assumptions of a constant source and first-order linear sinks are standard and physically justified approximations used in large-scale atmospheric models. All necessary parameters are provided with consistent units, and the questions posed have unique, meaningful solutions. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe evolution of the aerosol mass burden, $B(t)$, is governed by the conservation of mass. The time rate of change of $B(t)$ is equal to the sum of sources minus the sum of sinks.\nThe source is a constant emission rate, $E$.\nThe sinks are dry deposition and wet scavenging. The problem states that these are first-order loss processes, meaning each sink is proportional to the aerosol mass burden $B(t)$.\nThe dry deposition sink is $\\lambda_{d} B(t)$.\nThe wet scavenging sink is $\\lambda_{w} B(t)$.\n\nCombining these terms, the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the aerosol mass burden is:\n$$ \\frac{dB(t)}{dt} = E - \\lambda_{d} B(t) - \\lambda_{w} B(t) $$\nThis equation can be simplified by defining a total loss rate coefficient, $\\lambda$, as the sum of the individual loss rate coefficients:\n$$ \\lambda = \\lambda_{d} + \\lambda_{w} $$\nThe ODE then becomes:\n$$ \\frac{dB(t)}{dt} = E - \\lambda B(t) $$\nThis is a first-order linear inhomogeneous ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients.\n\n1) Derivation of the steady-state aerosol burden, $B^{\\ast}$.\nAt steady-state, the system is in equilibrium, which means the aerosol mass burden is no longer changing with time. Mathematically, this corresponds to the condition:\n$$ \\frac{dB}{dt} = 0 $$\nSubstituting this condition into the governing ODE and replacing $B(t)$ with the steady-state burden $B^{\\ast}$:\n$$ 0 = E - \\lambda B^{\\ast} $$\nSolving for $B^{\\ast}$ gives the expression for the steady-state burden:\n$$ \\lambda B^{\\ast} = E $$\n$$ B^{\\ast} = \\frac{E}{\\lambda} $$\nSubstituting the definition of $\\lambda$ back into the expression, we obtain the analytical solution for $B^{\\ast}$ in terms of the given parameters:\n$$ B^{\\ast} = \\frac{E}{\\lambda_{d} + \\lambda_{w}} $$\n\n2) Derivation of the e-folding lifetime, $\\tau$.\nThe e-folding lifetime, $\\tau$, characterizes the time scale on which the system relaxes towards its steady state. To find this, we solve the full time-dependent ODE. The equation can be rearranged as:\n$$ \\frac{dB(t)}{dt} + \\lambda B(t) = E $$\nThe general solution to this ODE is the sum of the homogeneous solution, $B_h(t)$, and a particular solution, $B_p(t)$.\nThe homogeneous equation is $\\frac{dB_h}{dt} + \\lambda B_h = 0$, which has the solution $B_h(t) = C \\exp(-\\lambda t)$, where $C$ is a constant of integration.\nFor the particular solution, we can use the steady-state solution we have already found: $B_p(t) = B^{\\ast} = \\frac{E}{\\lambda}$.\nThe general solution is therefore:\n$$ B(t) = B_h(t) + B_p(t) = C \\exp(-\\lambda t) + B^{\\ast} $$\nThe constant $C$ is determined by an initial condition, $B(t=0) = B_0$.\n$$ B_0 = C \\exp(0) + B^{\\ast} \\implies C = B_0 - B^{\\ast} $$\nThe complete solution describing the evolution of the burden from an initial state $B_0$ is:\n$$ B(t) = (B_0 - B^{\\ast}) \\exp(-\\lambda t) + B^{\\ast} $$\nThis can be rewritten to show the relaxation of the deviation from steady state, $B(t) - B^{\\ast}$:\n$$ B(t) - B^{\\ast} = (B_0 - B^{\\ast}) \\exp(-\\lambda t) $$\nThe e-folding lifetime, $\\tau$, is the time required for the initial deviation from steady state, $(B_0 - B^{\\ast})$, to decay by a factor of $e$. This occurs when the exponential term $\\exp(-\\lambda t)$ equals $\\exp(-1)$.\nSetting $t = \\tau$, we require:\n$$ \\exp(-\\lambda \\tau) = \\exp(-1) $$\n$$ -\\lambda \\tau = -1 $$\n$$ \\tau = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} $$\nThis is the characteristic time scale of the exponential decay. Substituting the definition of $\\lambda$, we get the analytical expression for the e-folding lifetime:\n$$ \\tau = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{d} + \\lambda_{w}} $$\nThis quantity is also referred to as the mean residence time of the aerosol in the box.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical values using the given parameters:\n$E = 0.85$ Tg day$^{-1}$\n$\\lambda_{d} = 0.12$ day$^{-1}$\n$\\lambda_{w} = 0.21$ day$^{-1}$\n\nFirst, calculate the total loss rate coefficient $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\lambda = \\lambda_{d} + \\lambda_{w} = 0.12 \\text{ day}^{-1} + 0.21 \\text{ day}^{-1} = 0.33 \\text{ day}^{-1} $$\nNow, calculate the numerical value for the steady-state burden $B^{\\ast}$:\n$$ B^{\\ast} = \\frac{E}{\\lambda} = \\frac{0.85 \\text{ Tg day}^{-1}}{0.33 \\text{ day}^{-1}} \\approx 2.575757... \\text{ Tg} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ B^{\\ast} = 2.576 \\text{ Tg} $$\nNext, calculate the numerical value for the e-folding lifetime $\\tau$:\n$$ \\tau = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{0.33 \\text{ day}^{-1}} \\approx 3.030303... \\text{ days} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ \\tau = 3.030 \\text{ days} $$",

            "problem": "Consider a horizontally homogeneous vegetated surface under steady-state conditions with no sources in the air column between a reference height and the canopy elements. In the framework of numerical weather prediction and climate modeling, the dry deposition of an aerosol species is parameterized by a flux to the surface. Let the near-surface reference concentration be $C$ and the downward dry deposition flux be $F$ at stationarity. Assume that turbulent and molecular transfer can be represented as a sequence of sublayers between the reference height and the ultimate sink at the surface or within the canopy. Each sublayer $i$ is characterized by a transfer resistance $r_i$ defined by the relation that the mean concentration drop across that sublayer equals the flux times the resistance.\n\nStarting from conservation of mass, the definition of flux as a constant in the absence of internal sources or sinks in the air column, and the constitutive behavior of diffusive and turbulent transfer (for example, Fickian-like transport where flux is proportional to a concentration gradient), derive an expression for the effective deposition velocity $v_d$ relating $F$ and $C$ through $F = v_d C$ in terms of the sequence of sublayer resistances.

The provided values for resistances are physically plausible. The units are consistent.\n- **Verdict**: The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Proceed with Solution\n\n#### Derivation of the Combination Rule for Resistances\nThe problem asks for a derivation of the effective deposition velocity, which requires understanding how the resistances combine. We model the path of the aerosol from a reference height in the atmosphere to the final sink within the canopy as passing through three distinct sublayers in series: the aerodynamic sublayer, the quasi-laminar sublayer, and the canopy uptake sublayer.\n\nLet $C$ be the concentration at the reference height. Let $C_1$ be the concentration at the interface between the aerodynamic and quasi-laminar sublayers, and $C_2$ be the concentration at the interface between the quasi-laminar sublayer and the canopy surface. The ultimate sink for the aerosol has an effective concentration of $C_s = 0$.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, for any sublayer $i$, the concentration drop $\\Delta C_i$ across it is related to the flux $F$ and the resistance $r_i$ by:\n$$ \\Delta C_i = F \\cdot r_i $$\nUnder steady-state conditions with no sources or sinks in the intervening air column, the principle of mass conservation dictates that the flux $F$ must be constant through each sublayer.\n\nApplying the definition of resistance to each of the three sublayers:\n1.  Across the aerodynamic sublayer (resistance $r_a$): The concentration drops from $C$ to $C_1$.\n    $$ C - C_1 = F \\cdot r_a $$\n2.  Across the quasi-laminar sublayer (resistance $r_b$): The concentration drops from $C_1$ to $C_2$.\n    $$ C_1 - C_2 = F \\cdot r_b $$\n3.  Across the canopy surface (resistance $r_c$): The concentration drops from $C_2$ to the sink concentration $C_s = 0$.\n    $$ C_2 - C_s = C_2 - 0 = F \\cdot r_c $$\n\nThe total concentration drop from the reference height to the sink is the sum of the individual drops. This is because the concentration profile is continuous.\n$$ \\Delta C_{\\text{total}} = (C - C_1) + (C_1 - C_2) + (C_2 - C_s) $$\n$$ \\Delta C_{\\text{total}} = C - C_s = C - 0 = C $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the individual drops:\n$$ C = (F \\cdot r_a) + (F \\cdot r_b) + (F \\cdot r_c) $$\nFactoring out the constant flux $F$:\n$$ C = F (r_a + r_b + r_c) $$\nThis shows that the total resistance, $R_t$, for resistances in series is their sum:\n$$ R_t = r_a + r_b + r_c $$\nThe relationship between the total concentration drop $C$, flux $F$, and total resistance $R_t$ is:\n$$ C = F \\cdot R_t \\quad \\text{or} \\quad F = \\frac{C}{R_t} $$\nThe effective deposition velocity, $v_d$, is defined by the relation $F = v_d C$. Comparing this with our derived expression for flux, $F = C/R_t$, we find:\n$$ v_d C = \\frac{C}{R_t} \\implies v_d = \\frac{1}{R_t} $$\nTherefore, the effective deposition velocity is the reciprocal of the total resistance, which is the sum of the individual series resistances:\n$$ v_d = \\frac{1}{r_a + r_b + r_c} $$\n\n#### Calculation of the Dry Deposition Flux\nWe are given the values for the individual resistances and the reference concentration. First, we calculate the total resistance $R_t$.\n$$ R_t = r_a + r_b + r_c $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ R_t = 50 \\,\\mathrm{s\\,m^{-1}} + 100 \\,\\mathrm{s\\,m^{-1}} + 150 \\,\\mathrm{s\\,m^{-1}} = 300 \\,\\mathrm{s\\,m^{-1}} $$\nNow, we can calculate the dry deposition flux $F$ using the relationship $F = C/R_t$.

The calculated value is exactly $0.04$. To express this with four significant figures, we add trailing zeros.\n$$ F = 0.04000 \\,\\mu\\mathrm{g\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}} $$\nThis value represents the mass of aerosol deposited per unit area per unit time.",
