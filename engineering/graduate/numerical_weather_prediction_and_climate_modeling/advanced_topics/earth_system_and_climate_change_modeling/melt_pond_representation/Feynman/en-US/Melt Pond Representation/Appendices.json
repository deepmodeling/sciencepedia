            "problem": "In a sea-ice column within a Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) and climate modeling framework, the sub-grid representation of surface heterogeneity is implemented via tiling of melt ponds, bare ice, and snow. Consider a horizontally homogeneous incoming shortwave (SW) irradiance at the surface, denoted by $S_{\\downarrow}$, and assume plane-parallel illumination with negligible horizontal photon transport between tiles. The albedo of a surface is defined as the fraction of incident SW radiation reflected. Under the assumption that tiles are side-by-side and do not mutually shadow or interact radiatively, the total reflected SW power from the grid cell equals the sum of the reflected SW power from each tile, and the net absorbed SW power equals the incident SW minus the reflected SW.\n\nGiven tile area fractions $f_{p}$, $f_{i}$, and $f_{s}$ for melt ponds, bare ice, and snow, respectively, and their corresponding albedos $\\alpha_{p}$, $\\alpha_{i}$, and $\\alpha_{s}$, assume that $f_{p}+f_{i}+f_{s}=1$ and that $S_{\\downarrow}$ is uniform over all tiles. Using the above physical principles, derive the effective grid-cell albedo and the net absorbed SW per unit area. Then, define a baseline “no-pond” state in which the melt-pond area is converted to bare ice, so the baseline area fractions are $f_{i}^{\\mathrm{(base)}}=f_{i}+f_{p}$ and $f_{s}^{\\mathrm{(base)}}=f_{s}$ with albedos $\\alpha_{i}$ and $\\alpha_{s}$ unchanged.
