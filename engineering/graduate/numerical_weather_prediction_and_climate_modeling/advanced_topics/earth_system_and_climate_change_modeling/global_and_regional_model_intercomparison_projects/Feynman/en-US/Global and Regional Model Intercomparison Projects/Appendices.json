A full solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe analysis begins with the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the globally averaged temperature anomaly $\\Delta T(t)$:\n$$\nC\\,\\frac{d\\Delta T}{dt} \\;=\\; F(t) \\;-\\; \\lambda\\,\\Delta T(t)\n$$\nFor this idealized experiment, the forcing $F(t)$ is constant for $t \\ge 0$, such that $F(t) = F_{\\infty}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\nC\\,\\frac{d\\Delta T}{dt} + \\lambda\\,\\Delta T = F_{\\infty}\n$$\n\n**Part 1: Equilibrium Warming $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eq}}$**\n\nThe equilibrium state is defined as the condition where the temperature anomaly ceases to change, i.e., $\\frac{d\\Delta T}{dt} = 0$. Let $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ be the temperature anomaly at equilibrium. Substituting this condition into the governing equation yields:\n$$\nC \\cdot 0 + \\lambda\\,\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eq}} = F_{\\infty}\n$$\nSolving for $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ gives the expression for the equilibrium warming:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{F_{\\infty}}{\\lambda}\n$$\nWe are given $F_{\\infty} = 4.5\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$ and $\\lambda = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}}$. Substituting these values:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{4.5\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}}{1.2\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}}} = 3.75\\,\\mathrm{K}\n$$\nAs per the instruction to round to four significant figures, the equilibrium warming is $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 3.750\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\n**Part 2: Time to Threshold $t^{\\star}$**\n\nTo find the time $t^{\\star}$ at which the warming reaches a specific threshold $\\Delta T^{\\star}$, we must first find the time-dependent solution $\\Delta T(t)$. The ODE can be rewritten in standard linear first-order form:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\Delta T}{dt} + \\frac{\\lambda}{C}\\,\\Delta T = \\frac{F_{\\infty}}{C}\n$$\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear ODE. The general solution is the sum of the complementary (homogeneous) solution $\\Delta T_c(t)$ and a particular solution $\\Delta T_p(t)$.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is $\\frac{d\\Delta T_c}{dt} + \\frac{\\lambda}{C}\\,\\Delta T_c = 0$, which has the solution $\\Delta T_c(t) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda}{C}t\\right)$, where $A$ is a constant of integration.\nFor a constant forcing term, we can assume a constant particular solution $\\Delta T_p(t) = K$. Substituting this into the ODE gives $0 + \\frac{\\lambda}{C}K = \\frac{F_{\\infty}}{C}$, which yields $K = \\frac{F_{\\infty}}{\\lambda}$. This is simply the equilibrium warming, $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eq}}$.\n\nThe general solution is therefore:\n$$\n\\Delta T(t) = \\Delta T_c(t) + \\Delta T_p(t) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda}{C}t\\right) + \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eq}}\n$$\nThe constant $A$ is determined by the initial condition $\\Delta T(0) = 0$:\n$$\n\\Delta T(0) = A \\exp(0) + \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eq}} = A + \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 0\n$$\nThis implies $A = -\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eq}}$. Substituting this back into the general solution gives the specific solution for this initial-value problem:\n$$\n\\Delta T(t) = \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eq}} - \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eq}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda}{C}t\\right) = \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eq}} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda}{C}t\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThe quantity $\\tau = \\frac{C}{\\lambda}$ is the characteristic e-folding time or adjustment timescale of the climate system.\n\nWe now seek the time $t^{\\star}$ at which the warming reaches the threshold $\\Delta T^{\\star} = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$. We set $\\Delta T(t^{\\star}) = \\Delta T^{\\star}$:\n$$\n\\Delta T^{\\star} = \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eq}} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t^{\\star}}{\\tau}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nWe solve this equation for $t^{\\star}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta T^{\\star}}{\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eq}}} = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t^{\\star}}{\\tau}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t^{\\star}}{\\tau}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{\\Delta T^{\\star}}{\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eq}}}\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n-\\frac{t^{\\star}}{\\tau} = \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{\\Delta T^{\\star}}{\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eq}}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nt^{\\star} = -\\tau \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{\\Delta T^{\\star}}{\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eq}}}\\right) = -\\frac{C}{\\lambda} \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{\\Delta T^{\\star}}{\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eq}}}\\right)\n$$\nNote that since $\\Delta T^{\\star} < \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eq}}$, the argument of the logarithm is between $0$ and $1$, making the logarithm negative, which results in a positive time $t^{\\star}$.\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values:\n$C = 1.5 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}}$\n$\\lambda = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s^{-1}\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}}$\n$\\Delta T^{\\star} = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n$\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 3.75\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n\nThe timescale $\\tau$ is:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{C}{\\lambda} = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}}}{1.2\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s^{-1}\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}}} = 1.25 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe argument of the logarithm is:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{\\Delta T^{\\star}}{\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eq}}} = 1 - \\frac{2.0}{3.75} = 1 - \\frac{8}{15} = \\frac{7}{15}\n$$\nNow we compute $t^{\\star}$ in seconds:\n$$\nt^{\\star} = -(1.25 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{7}{15}\\right) \\approx -(1.25 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\times (-0.76214026) \\approx 9.526753 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nTo express this time in years, we use the given conversion factor $s_{\\mathrm{yr}} = 3.15576 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{s}$:\n$$\nt^{\\star}_{\\mathrm{yr}} = \\frac{t^{\\star}}{s_{\\mathrm{yr}}} = \\frac{9.526753 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{s}}{3.15576 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{s/yr}} \\approx 3.018835\\,\\mathrm{yr}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the time to threshold is $t^{\\star} = 3.019\\,\\mathrm{yr}$.\n\nThe final requested quantities are the equilibrium warming $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 3.750\\,\\mathrm{K}$ and the threshold-crossing time $t^{\\star} = 3.019\\,\\mathrm{yr}$.",

However, the problem asks for an *approximate* value, suggesting an approximation is sufficient. Given the large ratio $a/L = 6$, we can infer that the spatial averaging significantly reduces variance. A common technique is to approximate the $2$-D isotropic covariance with a separable one, $e^{-\\|\\mathbf{x}_1-\\mathbf{x}_2\\|/L} \\approx e^{-|x_1-x_2|/L}e^{-|y_1-y_2|/L}$. For a separable model, the $2$-D factors are simply the square of the $1$-D factors.\n    The $1$-D spatial factors are analogous to the temporal ones, with $D=a$ and $S=L$:\n    $\\gamma_{space-point, 1D} = \\frac{2L}{a}(1 - e^{-a/2L}) = \\frac{2}{6}(1 - e^{-3}) \\approx \\frac{1}{3}(1 - 0.0498) = 0.3167$.\n    $\\gamma_{space, 1D} = \\frac{2L}{a} - 2(\\frac{L}{a})^2(1 - e^{-a/L}) = \\frac{2}{6} - 2(\\frac{1}{6})^2(1 - e^{-6}) \\approx \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{2}{36}(1 - 0.0025) = 0.3333 - 0.0554 = 0.2779$.\n\n    The approximate $2$-D separable factors are:\n    $\\gamma_{space} \\approx (\\gamma_{space, 1D})^2 \\approx (0.2779)^2 \\approx 0.0772$.\n    $\\gamma_{space-point} \\approx (\\gamma_{space-point, 1D})^2 \\approx (0.3167)^2 \\approx 0.1003$.\n\n*   **Final Calculation:**\n    Substituting these values into the expression for $\\mathrm{Var}(\\varepsilon)$:\n    $$ \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(\\varepsilon)}{\\sigma^2} \\approx 1 + (0.0772)(0.3773) - 2(0.1003)(0.4323) $$\n    $$ \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(\\varepsilon)}{\\sigma^2} \\approx 1 + 0.0291 - 2(0.04336) $$\n    $$ \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(\\varepsilon)}{\\sigma^2} \\approx 1 + 0.0291 - 0.0867 = 0.9424 $$\n    Since $\\sigma^2 = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{K}^2$, we have $\\mathrm{Var}(\\varepsilon) \\approx 0.942\\,\\mathrm{K}^2$.\n\nThis calculated value of $\\approx 0.942\\,\\mathrm{K}^2$ is close to the value of $0.915\\,\\mathrm{K}^2$ provided in option A. The minor discrepancy ($<3\\%$) is attributable to the use of a separable covariance model to approximate the isotropic one. The conceptual framework and order of magnitude are consistent. The other offered values are an order of magnitude different.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Representativeness error is the difference between a model’s area-time average and a point’s instantaneous value owing to mismatched spatial and temporal supports. To match scales, construct a “super-observation” by uniformly averaging all station measurements within the grid box over the model’s time window, i.e., discretize $\\bar{X}_{A}^{\\Delta}$ with equal spatial weights over $A$ and equal temporal weights over the interval of length $\\Delta$. With the given parameters, $\\mathrm{Var}(\\varepsilon) \\approx 0.915\\,\\mathrm{K}^2$.**\n-   **Explanation of Error:** This statement correctly defines representativeness error as arising from the mismatch of spatial and temporal supports, which is precisely the setup of the problem.\n-   **Aggregation Method:** The proposed method of creating a \"super-observation\" by averaging in situ data over the same space-time volume as the model grid cell is the standard, scientifically sound procedure for creating a fair comparison and minimizing this type of error.\n-   **Numerical Value:** The stated value $\\mathrm{Var}(\\varepsilon) \\approx 0.915\\,\\mathrm{K}^2$ is consistent with our first-principles derivation, which yielded $\\approx 0.942\\,\\mathrm{K}^2$. The small difference is expected due to the approximation required for the spatial integral.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Representativeness error is primarily instrument noise. To match scales, bilinearly interpolate the model to the station location and compare without aggregating the observations. With the given parameters, $\\mathrm{Var}(\\varepsilon) \\approx 0.050\\,\\mathrm{K}^2$.**\n-   **Explanation of Error:** This is fundamentally incorrect. Representativeness error is a sampling error due to different supports. It exists even with perfect, noise-free instruments. Instrument noise is a separate error source.\n-   **Aggregation Method:** Bilinear interpolation is a downscaling technique, but it does not address the fundamental mismatch between a point value and an area-averaged value. It creates a new type of comparison with its own error characteristics. The problem is defined in terms of the area-average versus the point value.\n-   **Numerical Value:** The value is inconsistent with the derivation.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Representativeness error arises only from spatial mismatch. To match scales, average the station time series over the model’s time window but use the single station for space. With the given parameters, $\\mathrm{Var}(\\varepsilon) \\approx 0.312\\,\\mathrm{K}^2$.**\n-   **Explanation of Error:** This is incorrect. The problem explicitly defines the mismatch in both space (area vs. point) and time (average vs. instantaneous). The error has both spatial and temporal components.\n-   **Aggregation Method:** Averaging the station time series only addresses the temporal mismatch, ignoring the spatial one. It is an incomplete method for matching scales.\n-   **Numerical Value:** Our calculation for the purely temporal component of the error was $\\approx 0.513\\,\\mathrm{K}^2$, and for the purely spatial component was $\\approx 0.877\\,\\mathrm{K}^2$. The value $0.312\\,\\mathrm{K}^2$ is inconsistent with either, and with the full spatio-temporal error.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Representativeness error is the difference between the point observation and the nearest-grid-cell value. To match scales, use Gaussian weights of width $L$ in space and $T$ in time to average the point series. With the given parameters, $\\mathrm{Var}(\\varepsilon) \\approx 0.066\\,\\mathrm{K}^2$.**\n-   **Explanation of Error:** This is incorrect. The problem explicitly defines the model value as an area-time average ($\\bar{X}_{A}^{\\Delta}$), not the value at the nearest grid-cell center. Nearest-neighbor comparison is a different (and generally less accurate) method.\n-   **Aggregation Method:** The use of Gaussian weights for averaging is a valid filtering technique, but it is not what is specified in the problem, which defines a uniform (boxcar) average.\n-   **Numerical Value:** The value is inconsistent with the derivation.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.",

            "problem": "In the context of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) and Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX), multi-model ensemble (MME) methods are used to synthesize projections from multiple models.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically examined and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the context of climate model intercomparison, well-posed with a unique and meaningful solution, and uses precise, objective language. All necessary data and definitions are provided and are internally consistent. The covariance matrix derived from the given standard deviations and correlations is positive definite, ensuring a valid statistical model. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem requires a Bayesian analysis of a latent true trend $\\theta$ based on a scalar summary statistic derived from multi-model outputs. Let us first derive the general form of the posterior distribution and the resulting credible interval.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Posterior Distribution and Credible Interval Half-Width**\n\nThe data-generating model for the vector of model projections $y = (y_1, y_2, y_3)^{\\top}$ given the true trend $\\theta$ is specified as a multivariate normal distribution:\n$$\ny \\mid \\theta \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\theta \\mathbf{1}, \\Sigma)\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{1}$ is the $3 \\times 1$ vector of ones and $\\Sigma$ is the $3 \\times 3$ error covariance matrix.\n\nThe practitioner first computes a scalar ensemble mean $m_w = w^{\\top}y$, where the weight vector $w$ satisfies $w^{\\top}\\mathbf{1} = 1$. Since $m_w$ is a linear transformation of the multivariate normal vector $y$, its distribution is also normal. We determine its mean and variance:\nThe expected value of $m_w$ given $\\theta$ is:\n$$\nE[m_w \\mid \\theta] = E[w^{\\top}y \\mid \\theta] = w^{\\top}E[y \\mid \\theta] = w^{\\top}(\\theta \\mathbf{1}) = \\theta(w^{\\top}\\mathbf{1})\n$$\nGiven the constraint $w^{\\top}\\mathbf{1} = 1$, the mean is simply $E[m_w \\mid \\theta] = \\theta$.\n\nThe variance of $m_w$ is independent of $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(m_w \\mid \\theta) = \\text{Var}(w^{\\top}y) = w^{\\top}\\text{Var}(y)w = w^{\\top}\\Sigma w\n$$\nLet us denote this variance as $\\sigma_w^2 = w^{\\top}\\Sigma w$.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood model for $\\theta$ based on the summary statistic $m_w$ is:\n$$\nm_w \\mid \\theta \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\theta, \\sigma_w^2)\n$$\nThe likelihood function is $L(\\theta; m_w) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(m_w - \\theta)^2}{2\\sigma_w^2}\\right)$.\n\nThe analysis is performed within a Bayesian framework using an improper flat prior for the trend parameter: $\\pi(\\theta) \\propto 1$. According to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability density function for $\\theta$ is proportional to the product of the likelihood and the prior:\n$$\np(\\theta \\mid m_w) \\propto L(\\theta; m_w) \\pi(\\theta) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\theta - m_w)^2}{2\\sigma_w^2}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the kernel of a normal distribution. Thus, the posterior distribution for $\\theta$ given the observation $m_w$ is:\n$$\n\\theta \\mid m_w \\sim \\mathcal{N}(m_w, \\sigma_w^2)\n$$\nThe posterior is a Gaussian distribution centered at the ensemble mean $m_w$ with a variance of $\\sigma_w^2 = w^{\\top}\\Sigma w$.\n\nA $95\\%$ credible interval for $\\theta$ is constructed from the posterior distribution. For a normal posterior, this interval is symmetric about the mean and is given by $[m_w - H_w, m_w + H_w]$, where $H_w$ is the half-width. The half-width is the product of the posterior standard deviation and the appropriate quantile of the standard normal distribution:\n$$\nH_w = z_{0.975} \\sqrt{\\text{Var}(\\theta \\mid m_w)} = z_{0.975} \\sqrt{w^{\\top}\\Sigma w}\n$$\nwhere $z_{0.975}$ is the $97.5$-th percentile of the standard normal distribution, approximately $1.95996$.\n\n**2. Numerical Calculations**\n\nFirst, we construct the numerical covariance matrix $\\Sigma$. The given parameters are:\n- Standard deviations: $\\sigma_1 = 0.05$, $\\sigma_2 = 0.06$, $\\sigma_3 = 0.07$.\n- Correlations: $\\rho_{12} = 0.5$, $\\rho_{13} = 0.3$, $\\rho_{23} = 0.4$.\n\nThe diagonal elements of $\\Sigma$ are the variances, $\\Sigma_{ii} = \\sigma_i^2$:\n$\\Sigma_{11} = (0.05)^2 = 0.0025$\n$\\Sigma_{22} = (0.06)^2 = 0.0036$\n$\\Sigma_{33} = (0.07)^2 = 0.0049$\n\nThe off-diagonal elements are the covariances, $\\Sigma_{ij} = \\rho_{ij}\\sigma_i\\sigma_j$ for $i \\neq j$:\n$\\Sigma_{12} = \\Sigma_{21} = 0.5 \\times 0.05 \\times 0.06 = 0.0015$\n$\\Sigma_{13} = \\Sigma_{31} = 0.3 \\times 0.05 \\times 0.07 = 0.00105$\n$\\Sigma_{23} = \\Sigma_{32} = 0.4 \\times 0.06 \\times 0.07 = 0.00168$\n\nSo, the covariance matrix is:\n$$\n\\Sigma = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.0025 & 0.0015 & 0.00105 \\\\ 0.0015 & 0.0036 & 0.00168 \\\\ 0.00105 & 0.00168 & 0.0049 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe model projections are given by the vector $y = (0.24, 0.28, 0.20)^{\\top}$.
