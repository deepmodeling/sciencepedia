It is a standard, well-posed problem in physical glaciology. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe first step is to derive the prognostic equation for ice thickness $H$. This is achieved by applying the principle of mass conservation. For an incompressible material of constant density, the continuity equation states that the divergence of the velocity field $\\mathbf{v} = (u, v, w)$ is zero:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} = 0 $$\nHere, $u$ and $v$ are the horizontal velocity components and $w$ is the vertical velocity component in a Cartesian coordinate system where $z$ is the vertical direction.\n\nWe integrate this equation over the depth of the ice column, from the base elevation $z=b(x,y,t)$ to the surface elevation $z=s(x,y,t)$:\n$$ \\int_{b}^{s} \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} \\right) dz + \\int_{b}^{s} \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} dz = 0 $$\nThe second integral is exact:\n$$ \\int_{b}^{s} \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} dz = w(s) - w(b) $$\nwhere $w(s)$ and $w(b)$ are the vertical velocities of ice at the surface and base, respectively.\n\nFor the first integral, we use the Leibniz integral rule. Let $\\mathbf{u}_h = (u,v)$ be the horizontal velocity vector and $\\nabla_h = (\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y})$ be the horizontal gradient operator. The vertically integrated horizontal flux is defined as $\\mathbf{q} = \\int_{b}^{s} \\mathbf{u}_h dz$. The divergence of this flux is $\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{q}$. Applying the Leibniz rule:\n$$ \\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{q} = \\nabla_h \\cdot \\int_{b}^{s} \\mathbf{u}_h dz = \\int_{b}^{s} (\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{u}_h) dz + \\mathbf{u}_h(s) \\cdot \\nabla_h s - \\mathbf{u}_h(b) \\cdot \\nabla_h b $$\nRearranging gives the term we need:\n$$ \\int_{b}^{s} (\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{u}_h) dz = \\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{q} - \\mathbf{u}_h(s) \\cdot \\nabla_h s + \\mathbf{u}_h(b) \\cdot \\nabla_h b $$\nSubstituting this back into the integrated continuity equation, and using the problem's notation $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q}$ for the horizontal divergence $\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{q}$:\n$$ (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} - \\mathbf{u}_h(s) \\cdot \\nabla_h s + \\mathbf{u}_h(b) \\cdot \\nabla_h b) + (w(s) - w(b)) = 0 $$\nNext, we apply the kinematic boundary conditions at the surface and base. A material point on a boundary surface must move with that surface, adjusted for any mass flux across it.\nThe condition at the surface $z=s$ is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{u}_h(s) \\cdot \\nabla_h s = w(s) + a_s $$\nwhere $a_s$ is the surface mass balance rate (accumulation). Rearranging gives:\n$$ w(s) - \\mathbf{u}_h(s) \\cdot \\nabla_h s = \\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial t} - a_s $$\nThe condition at the base $z=b$ is analogous, but with the basal mass balance rate $a_b$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{u}_h(b) \\cdot \\nabla_h b = w(b) + a_b $$\nThe problem states that basal mass balance is negligible, so $a_b=0$. Rearranging gives:\n$$ w(b) - \\mathbf{u}_h(b) \\cdot \\nabla_h b = \\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial t} $$\nNow we substitute these expressions for the boundary terms back into the integrated continuity equation:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} - \\left( \\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial t} - a_s \\right) + \\left( \\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial t} \\right) = 0 $$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} - \\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial t} + a_s + \\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial t} = 0 $$\nRecognizing that the ice thickness is $H = s - b$, its time derivative is $\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial t} - \\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial t}$. We can rewrite the equation as:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} - \\left( \\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial t} - \\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial t} \\right) + a_s = 0 $$\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} - \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial t} + a_s = 0 $$\nSolving for the time rate of change of ice thickness, we obtain the prognostic equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial t} = a_s - \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} $$\nThis equation states that the local rate of thickening is the net result of mass gain from the atmosphere ($a_s$) and mass loss from horizontal ice export ($\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q}$).\n\nWith the prognostic equation derived, we compute the total change in thickness $\\Delta H$ over a time interval $\\Delta t$. Since $a_s$ and $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q}$ are given as constant tendencies, we can integrate the equation directly:\n$$ \\Delta H = \\int_{0}^{\\Delta t} \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial t} dt = \\int_{0}^{\\Delta t} (a_s - \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q}) dt $$\n$$ \\Delta H = (a_s - \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q}) \\Delta t $$\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values: $a_s = 0.5\\ \\mathrm{m\\ yr^{-1}}$, $\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{q} = 0.3\\ \\mathrm{m\\ yr^{-1}}$, and $\\Delta t = 1\\ \\mathrm{yr}$.\n$$ \\Delta H = (0.5\\ \\mathrm{m\\ yr^{-1}} - 0.3\\ \\mathrm{m\\ yr^{-1}}) \\times 1\\ \\mathrm{yr} $$\n$$ \\Delta H = 0.2\\ \\mathrm{m\\ yr^{-1}} \\times 1\\ \\mathrm{yr} $$\n$$ \\Delta H = 0.2\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ \\Delta H = 0.200\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\nFinally, we must assess the local mass budget residual, defined as $R \\equiv \\Delta H - (a_s - \\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{q})\\Delta t$. From our derivation, we established that for constant tendencies, $\\Delta H$ is precisely equal to $(a_s - \\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{q})\\Delta t$. Therefore, substituting this into the definition of the residual:\n$$ R = [(a_s - \\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{q})\\Delta t] - [(a_s - \\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{q})\\Delta t] = 0 $$\nThe residual is exactly zero, confirming that the mass budget closes perfectly under the assumptions made. The change in thickness is, by definition, the integrated net mass balance.",

The basal shear traction vector is assumed colinear with the basal velocity vector, and its magnitude arises from frictional dissipation at the bed. Two widely used closures for the basal traction are employed in interactive ice sheet dynamics: a frictional power-law (Weertman-type) basal sliding law, and a stress cap implied by a Mohr–Coulomb failure criterion for the subglacial till. In the sliding state, the basal traction magnitude is set by mechanical equilibrium between the gravitational driving and basal drag. Assume the following fundamental bases:\n- The basal traction magnitude $\\,\\tau_b\\,$ is a well-defined mechanical stress, and the basal slip speed $\\,u_b \\ge 0\\,$ is the magnitude of the basal velocity vector.\n- A generalized power-law friction closure relates $\\,\\tau_b\\,$ and $\\,u_b\\,$ through a material coefficient $\\,C0\\,$ and an exponent $\\,m1\\,$ characterizing the nonlinearity of bed rheology.\n- The Mohr–Coulomb yield criterion sets an upper bound on the resolvable basal traction magnitude, $\\,\\tau_b \\le \\tau_c\\,$, where $\\,\\tau_c = \\mu N\\,$, $\\,\\mu$ is a friction coefficient, and $\\,N$ is the effective pressure at the bed.\n\nStarting only from these principles, derive an expression for the basal slip speed $\\,u_b\\,$ as a function of $\\,\\tau_b\\,$, $\\,C\\,$, and $\\,m\\,$ implied by the frictional power-law closure, and explain how the Coulomb cap modifies the admissible traction.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an expression for the basal slip speed $u_b$ from a generalized power-law closure and an explanation of how a Mohr-Coulomb yield criterion affects the basal traction. Subsequently, numerical calculations are required for the basal speed under two different traction conditions and their ratio.\n\nFirst, we establish the explicit functional form of the power-law friction closure. The problem states that the basal traction magnitude $\\tau_b$ is related to the basal slip speed $u_b$ via a power law involving a coefficient $C$ and an exponent $m$. The units of these quantities are provided as $[\\tau_b] = \\mathrm{Pa}$, $[u_b] = \\mathrm{m}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, and $[C] = \\mathrm{Pa}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^m\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^{-m}$.

Substituting $p=1$, we get $m(1)-q=0$, which implies $q=m$.\n$3.$ For meters ($\\mathrm{m}$): $-mp+q=0$. Substituting $p=1$, we get $-m(1)+q=0$, which also implies $q=m$.\nAssuming the simplest case where the dimensionless constant $k=1$, the unique relationship consistent with the provided units is:\n$$ \\tau_b = C u_b^m $$\nThis is the specific form of the generalized power-law friction closure. It describes a shear-thickening rheology since the exponent $m > 1$, meaning the resistance to sliding increases more than linearly with speed. To find the basal slip speed $u_b$ as a function of the other parameters, we rearrange this equation:\n$$ u_b^m = \\frac{\\tau_b}{C} $$\n$$ u_b(\\tau_b, C, m) = \\left(\\frac{\\tau_b}{C}\\right)^{1/m} $$\n\nNext, we address the role of the Mohr-Coulomb yield criterion. This criterion imposes an upper limit on the magnitude of the basal traction that the subglacial till can sustain before failing. This limit, or yield stress, is denoted by $\\tau_c$ and is given by $\\tau_c = \\mu N$, where $\\mu$ is the friction coefficient and $N$ is the effective pressure at the bed. The admissible basal traction $\\tau_b$ must therefore satisfy the condition $\\tau_b \\le \\tau_c$. The full basal sliding law is a composite rule: the power-law relates speed to traction, but only for traction values up to the Coulomb limit. If the gravitational driving stress (which must be balanced by $\\tau_b$ in equilibrium) exceeds $\\tau_c$, the bed material fails, and the traction is capped at $\\tau_c$. The actual basal traction is therefore $\\tau_b = \\min(\\tau_{\\text{driving}}, \\tau_c)$, and the corresponding speed is found using the derived power-law expression with this value of $\\tau_b$.\n\nWe now proceed with the numerical calculations using the provided parameters, converted to base SI units:\n- Basal traction: $\\tau_b = 100\\ \\mathrm{kPa} = 1 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$.\n- Material coefficient: $C = 10^7\\ \\mathrm{Pa\\ s^{m}\\ m^{-m}}$.\n- Exponent: $m = 3$.\n- Friction coefficient: $\\mu = 0.5$.\n- Effective pressure: $N = 1\\ \\mathrm{MPa} = 1 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the Coulomb traction limit, $\\tau_c$:\n$$ \\tau_c = \\mu N = (0.5) \\cdot (1 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{Pa}) = 5 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{Pa} $$\nSince the given admissible traction $\\tau_b = 1 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$ is less than $\\tau_c = 5 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$, the system is operating in the stable power-law sliding regime.\n\n$1.$ The basal slip speed predicted by the power-law closure for $\\tau_b = 100\\ \\mathrm{kPa}$:\n$$ u_b(\\tau_b) = \\left(\\frac{1 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{Pa}}{10^7\\ \\mathrm{Pa\\ s^3\\ m^{-3}}}\\right)^{1/3} = \\left(10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m^3\\ s^{-3}}\\right)^{1/3} = 10^{-2/3}\\ \\mathrm{m\\ s^{-1}} $$\nNumerically, this speed is $u_b(\\tau_b) \\approx 0.21544\\ \\mathrm{m\\ s^{-1}}$.
