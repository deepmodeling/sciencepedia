Radiation boundary conditions are designed for this purpose, but their effectiveness often depends on accurately knowing the wave's phase speed. This practice explores the consequences of an imperfect boundary condition by quantifying how an error in the assumed phase speed leads to a non-zero reflection coefficient, a direct measure of numerical contamination.

            "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional lateral boundary of a regional atmospheric model in Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) and climate modeling, where linearized shallow-water gravity waves propagate with phase speed $c = \\sqrt{g H}$ and satisfy the non-dispersive dispersion relation $\\omega = c k$, with $g$ denoting gravitational acceleration, $H$ the mean fluid depth, $k$ the wavenumber, and $\\omega$ the angular frequency. At the model’s left boundary located at $x=0$, the intended open (radiation) boundary condition is implemented in the usual Sommerfeld form for outbound left-going waves, but with a phase speed error: the boundary operator uses $c_{b} = c + \\delta c$ instead of the true $c$, resulting in an imperfect radiation condition. Let a monochromatic, left-going, plane gravity wave be incident upon the boundary from the interior (domain $x>0$). The total field near the boundary is the superposition of the incident left-going wave and a reflected right-going wave.\n\nStarting from the linearized shallow-water wave kinematics and the standard radiation boundary operator for left-going waves at $x=0$, namely $(\\partial_{t} - c_{b}\\,\\partial_{x})$ applied to the prognostic field at the boundary, derive the complex reflection coefficient $R$ defined as the ratio of the reflected-wave amplitude to the incident-wave amplitude, expressed as a function of $\\delta c$, $k$, and $c$. Then, quantitatively assess the sensitivity of $R$ to the phase speed error by computing the first derivative $\\partial R / \\partial(\\delta c)$ evaluated at $\\delta c = 0$.\n\nProvide your final answer as a row vector containing two closed-form analytic expressions: the reflection coefficient $R(\\delta c,k,c)$ and the sensitivity $\\left.\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial(\\delta c)}\\right|_{\\delta c=0}$. No numerical evaluation is required. The reflection coefficient is dimensionless, and the sensitivity has dimensions of inverse speed. Do not include physical units in your final answer.

            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a standard scenario in computational fluid dynamics and numerical weather prediction: the analysis of spurious reflections from an imperfect radiation boundary condition. The setup is based on the well-established theory of shallow-water waves and Sommerfeld boundary conditions. All necessary parameters and definitions are provided for a unique analytical solution. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a full solution can be derived.\n\nLet the prognostic field variable, such as the free-surface elevation in the shallow-water system, be denoted by $\\eta(x,t)$. The problem states that a monochromatic, left-going plane wave is incident upon the boundary at $x=0$ from the domain interior, which is $x>0$. A wave propagating in the negative $x$-direction (left-going) with angular frequency $\\omega$ and wavenumber $k$ can be represented in complex exponential form as:\n$$ \\eta_I(x,t) = A_I \\exp\\left[i(kx + \\omega t)\\right] $$\nHere, $A_I$ is the complex amplitude of the incident wave. The dispersion relation is given as $\\omega = ck$, where $c$ is the true phase speed. The phase velocity of this wave is $v_p = -\\omega/k = -c$, confirming it is left-going.\n\nUpon encountering the imperfect boundary at $x=0$, a portion of this wave is reflected. The reflected wave must propagate away from the boundary back into the domain, i.e., in the positive $x$-direction (right-going). This wave will have the same frequency $\\omega$ and wavenumber magnitude $k$ because the medium is linear, homogeneous, and time-invariant. The form of the reflected wave is:\n$$ \\eta_R(x,t) = A_R \\exp\\left[i(-kx + \\omega t)\\right] $$\nHere, $A_R$ is the complex amplitude of the reflected wave. The phase velocity is $v_p = \\omega/k = c$, confirming it is right-going.\n\nThe total field $\\eta(x,t)$ in the vicinity of the boundary is the linear superposition of the incident and reflected waves:\n$$ \\eta(x,t) = \\eta_I(x,t) + \\eta_R(x,t) = A_I \\exp\\left[i(kx + \\omega t)\\right] + A_R \\exp\\left[i(-kx + \\omega t)\\right] $$\n\nThe radiation boundary condition is applied at $x=0$.

The condition is:\n$$ \\left. \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - c_b \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\right) \\eta(x,t) \\right|_{x=0} = 0 $$\nTo apply this condition, we first compute the partial derivatives of the total field $\\eta(x,t)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t} = i\\omega A_I \\exp\\left[i(kx + \\omega t)\\right] + i\\omega A_R \\exp\\left[i(-kx + \\omega t)\\right] $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial x} = ik A_I \\exp\\left[i(kx + \\omega t)\\right] - ik A_R \\exp\\left[i(-kx + \\omega t)\\right] $$\nNow, we evaluate these derivatives at the boundary $x=0$:\n$$ \\left. \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t} \\right|_{x=0} = i\\omega (A_I + A_R) \\exp(i\\omega t) $$\n$$ \\left. \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial x} \\right|_{x=0} = ik (A_I - A_R) \\exp(i\\omega t) $$\nSubstituting these expressions into the boundary condition equation gives:\n$$ i\\omega (A_I + A_R) \\exp(i\\omega t) - c_b \\left[ ik (A_I - A_R) \\exp(i\\omega t) \\right] = 0 $$\nThe common factor $i \\exp(i\\omega t)$ is non-zero and can be canceled:\n$$ \\omega (A_I + A_R) - c_b k (A_I - A_R) = 0 $$\nOur goal is to find the complex reflection coefficient $R$, defined as $R = A_R / A_I$. We rearrange the equation to solve for this ratio:\n$$ \\omega A_I + \\omega A_R - c_b k A_I + c_b k A_R = 0 $$\n$$ A_R (\\omega + c_b k) = A_I (c_b k - \\omega) $$\n$$ R = \\frac{A_R}{A_I} = \\frac{c_b k - \\omega}{\\omega + c_b k} $$\nNow, we substitute the given relations $\\omega = ck$ and $c_b = c + \\delta c$:\n$$ R = \\frac{(c + \\delta c) k - ck}{ck + (c + \\delta c) k} $$\n$$ R = \\frac{ck + k \\delta c - ck}{ck + ck + k \\delta c} $$\n$$ R = \\frac{k \\delta c}{2ck + k \\delta c} $$\nSince $k$ is the wavenumber of a physical wave, $k \\neq 0$, and we can cancel it from the numerator and denominator. This yields the first requested expression, the reflection coefficient $R$ as a function of $\\delta c$ and $c$:\n$$ R(\\delta c,c) = \\frac{\\delta c}{2c + \\delta c} $$\nNote that for a perfect boundary condition, $\\delta c = 0$, which gives $R=0$ (no reflection), as expected.\n\nThe second part of the task is to assess the sensitivity of $R$ to the phase speed error $\\delta c$ by computing the first derivative $\\partial R / \\partial(\\delta c)$ and evaluating it at the point of no error, $\\delta c = 0$. We differentiate $R$ with respect to $\\delta c$, treating $c$ as a constant. Using the quotient rule for derivatives, $\\frac{d}{dx}(\\frac{u}{v}) = \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}$, with $u = \\delta c$ and $v = 2c + \\delta c$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial(\\delta c)} = \\frac{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial(\\delta c)}(\\delta c) \\cdot (2c + \\delta c) - (\\delta c) \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial(\\delta c)}(2c + \\delta c)}{(2c + \\delta c)^2} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial(\\delta c)} = \\frac{1 \\cdot (2c + \\delta c) - \\delta c \\cdot 1}{(2c + \\delta c)^2} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial(\\delta c)} = \\frac{2c + \\delta c - \\delta c}{(2c + \\delta c)^2} = \\frac{2c}{(2c + \\delta c)^2} $$\nNow, we evaluate this derivative at $\\delta c = 0$:\n$$ \\left. \\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial(\\delta c)} \\right|_{\\delta c=0} = \\frac{2c}{(2c + 0)^2} = \\frac{2c}{(2c)^2} = \\frac{2c}{4c^2} = \\frac{1}{2c} $$\nThis expression represents the first-order sensitivity of the reflection coefficient to small errors in the boundary phase speed. This is the second requested expression.\n\nThe final answer is a row vector containing the two derived expressions.",

It presents a canonical problem in numerical modeling concerning the impact of temporal discretization of boundary conditions on wave propagation. All necessary information is provided for a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution follows.\n\nThe governing equation for the passive scalar $\\phi$ is the one-dimensional linear advection equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} + v \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} = 0\n$$\nwhere $v > 0$ is the constant phase speed.\n\nWe solve this partial differential equation using the method of characteristics. The characteristic curves are defined by $\\frac{dx}{dt} = v$. Integrating this gives the characteristic lines $x - vt = C$, where $C$ is a constant. Along these lines, $\\phi$ is constant. This implies that the solution at any point $(x, t)$ is determined by the value of $\\phi$ at the western boundary ($x=0$) at an earlier time $t' = t - x/v$. The general solution is therefore:\n$$\n\\phi(x,t) = \\phi(0, t - x/v)\n$$\nThis relationship states that any signal introduced at the boundary $x=0$ propagates into the domain at speed $v$ without changing its shape, under the ideal conditions specified (no numerical diffusion or reflection).\n\nThe true physical process involves a sharp front arriving at the boundary at time $t_0$. This is represented by the boundary condition:\n$$\n\\phi_{\\text{true}}(0,t) = A H(t-t_0)\n$$\nwhere $H$ is the Heaviside step function and $t_0 \\in (t_k, t_{k+1})$.

For a sharp step function, this corresponds to the location of the discontinuity itself. We find this by setting the argument of the Heaviside function to zero:\n$$\nt - \\frac{x_{f,\\text{true}}(t)}{v} - t_0 = 0\n$$\nSolving for the true front position gives:\n$$\nx_{f,\\text{true}}(t) = v(t - t_0)\n$$\nThis equation shows that the true front propagates linearly with time from its initial arrival time $t_0$ at the boundary.\n\nThe regional model does not have access to the continuous function $\\phi_{\\text{true}}(0,t)$. Instead, it samples the boundary state at discrete times $t_k = k \\Delta T$. Because the true front arrives at $t_0 \\in (t_k, t_{k+1})$, the coarse model provides the values $\\phi(0, t_k) = 0$ and $\\phi(0, t_{k+1}) = A$. The regional model then applies linear temporal interpolation between these two points.

This deviation is maximized when $t_0$ is near the endpoints of the interval, $t_k$ or $t_{k+1} = t_k + \\Delta T$.\nAs $t_0 \\to t_k$, the term approaches $|t_k - (t_k + \\Delta T/2)| = |-\\Delta T/2| = \\Delta T/2$.\nAs $t_0 \\to t_{k+1}$, the term approaches $|t_{k+1} - (t_k + \\Delta T/2)| = |(t_k+\\Delta T) - (t_k + \\Delta T/2)| = |\\Delta T/2| = \\Delta T/2$.\nThus, the worst-case absolute position error is:\n$$\n|\\epsilon|_{\\text{max}} = v \\frac{\\Delta T}{2}\n$$\nThis error is independent of the forecast horizon $T$.\n\nNow, we specialize to the two given LBC update intervals, $\\Delta T_1 = 3\\,\\mathrm{h}$ and $\\Delta T_2 = 1\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\nThe worst-case error for $\\Delta T_1$ is $E_1 = v \\frac{\\Delta T_1}{2}$.\nThe worst-case error for $\\Delta T_2$ is $E_2 = v \\frac{\\Delta T_2}{2}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the increase in the worst-case front-position error when using $\\Delta T_1$ instead of $\\Delta T_2$.

The proposed correction is:\n$$\nu_{n}' = u_{n}(1 - \\alpha \\,\\mathrm{sgn}(u_{n}))\n$$\nThe new mass flux rate through a boundary $i$, denoted by $Q'_i$, is:\n$$\nQ'_i = \\int_{A_i} \\rho u'_n \\, dA_i = \\int_{A_i} \\rho u_n (1 - \\alpha \\,\\mathrm{sgn}(u_n)) \\, dA_i\n$$\nThis integral can be separated into two parts:\n$$\nQ'_i = \\int_{A_i} \\rho u_n \\, dA_i - \\alpha \\int_{A_i} \\rho u_n \\,\\mathrm{sgn}(u_n) \\, dA_i\n$$\nRecognizing that $u_n \\,\\mathrm{sgn}(u_n) = |u_n|$, the equation becomes:\n$$\nQ'_i = \\int_{A_i} \\rho u_n \\, dA_i - \\alpha \\int_{A_i} \\rho |u_n| \\, dA_i\n$$\nThe problem provides definitions for these integrals: the signed flux rate $Q_i = \\int_{A_i} \\rho u_n \\, dA_i$ and the unsigned integrated magnitude $M_i = \\int_{A_i} \\rho |u_n| \\, dA_i$. Substituting these into the expression for $Q'_i$:\n$$\nQ'_i = Q_i - \\alpha M_i\n$$\nTo close the lateral mass budget, the new total net flux rate, $Q'_{net}$, must be zero. $Q'_{net}$ is the sum of the corrected fluxes over all boundaries:\n$$\nQ'_{net} = \\sum_{i \\in \\{\\mathrm{W,E,S,N}\\}} Q'_i = \\sum_{i} (Q_i - \\alpha M_i) = 0\n$$\nRearranging the sum:\n$$\n\\left(\\sum_i Q_i\\right) - \\alpha \\left(\\sum_i M_i\\right) = 0\n$$\nLet $Q_{net} = \\sum_i Q_i$ be the total original net flux and $M_{total} = \\sum_i M_i$ be the sum of all unsigned flux magnitudes. The equation for $\\alpha$ is:\n$$\nQ_{net} - \\alpha M_{total} = 0\n$$\nSolving for $\\alpha$, we find the expression:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{Q_{net}}{M_{total}}\n$$\nWe now compute the value of $\\alpha$ using the given data. We have already found $Q_{net} = 2.0 \\times 10^{7} \\, \\mathrm{kg/s}$. We compute $M_{total}$:\n$$\nM_{total} = M_{\\mathrm{W}} + M_{\\mathrm{E}} + M_{\\mathrm{S}} + M_{\\mathrm{N}}\n$$\n$$\nM_{total} = (4.5 \\times 10^{7}) + (4.0 \\times 10^{7}) + (2.5 \\times 10^{7}) + (2.0 \\times 10^{7}) \\, \\mathrm{kg/s}\n$$\n$$\nM_{total} = (4.5 + 4.0 + 2.5 + 2.0) \\times 10^{7} \\, \\mathrm{kg/s} = 13.0 \\times 10^{7} \\, \\mathrm{kg/s} = 1.3 \\times 10^{8} \\, \\mathrm{kg/s}\n$$\nNow, substitute the values of $Q_{net}$ and $M_{total}$ to find $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{7} \\, \\mathrm{kg/s}}{1.3 \\times 10^{8} \\, \\mathrm{kg/s}} = \\frac{2.0}{13.0} \\approx 0.15384615...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested:\n$$\n\\alpha \\approx 0.1538\n$$",
