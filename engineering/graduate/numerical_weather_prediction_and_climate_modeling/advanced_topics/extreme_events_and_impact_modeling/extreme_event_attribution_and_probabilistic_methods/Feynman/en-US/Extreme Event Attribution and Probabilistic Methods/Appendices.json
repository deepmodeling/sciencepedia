            "problem": "A global coupled General Circulation Model (GCM) is used to perform a large-ensemble event attribution analysis for a heatwave threshold defined by daily maximum temperature exceeding a high quantile calibrated from a long control simulation. Two sets of atmosphere-only simulations are generated with distinct external forcings but identical model physics and comparable sample sizes: a \"factual\" world with present-day forcings and a \"counterfactual\" world approximating preindustrial forcings. Let $N_1$ and $N_0$ denote the total numbers of independent daily samples pooled across all ensemble members and relevant seasons for the factual and counterfactual sets, respectively, and let $n_1$ and $n_0$ denote the corresponding numbers of exceedances of the threshold. Assume that within each world, exceedances arise as independent Bernoulli trials with constant probability.\n\nIn a particular analysis, the model produced $N_1 = 50{,}000$ daily samples in the factual world with $n_1 = 2{,}100$ exceedances, and $N_0 = 50{,}000$ daily samples in the counterfactual world with $n_0 = 200$ exceedances.\n\nUsing only core definitions and large-sample properties of binomial sampling, do the following:\n\n- Define the Risk Ratio (RR) for the event as the ratio of the exceedance probability in the factual world to that in the counterfactual world, and compute its maximum likelihood estimator based on the given counts.\n- Starting from the binomial model and the large-sample Gaussian approximation for the sample proportions, derive the asymptotic standard error of the natural logarithm of the estimated Risk Ratio, and then evaluate it numerically using the given counts.\n\nRound both the estimated Risk Ratio and the asymptotic standard error of its natural logarithm to four significant figures. Report dimensionless quantities (do not express any result as a percentage).",
            "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We may proceed with the analysis.\n\nLet $p_1$ be the true probability of a daily maximum temperature exceedance in the factual world and $p_0$ be the true probability of an exceedance in the counterfactual world. The problem states that within each world, the occurrences of exceedances are modeled as independent Bernoulli trials.\nThe number of exceedances $n_1$ in the factual world, from a total of $N_1$ samples, is thus a realization of a random variable following a binomial distribution, $n_1 \\sim \\text{Bin}(N_1, p_1)$.\nSimilarly, the number of exceedances $n_0$ in the counterfactual world follows $n_0 \\sim \\text{Bin}(N_0, p_0)$.\n\nThe maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the probability parameter $p$ of a binomial distribution is the sample proportion $\\hat{p} = \\frac{n}{N}$.\nTherefore, the MLEs for $p_1$ and $p_0$ are:\n$$ \\hat{p}_1 = \\frac{n_1}{N_1} $$\n$$ \\hat{p}_0 = \\frac{n_0}{N_0} $$\n\nThe first task is to define the Risk Ratio ($RR$) and compute its MLE.\nThe $RR$ is defined as the ratio of the exceedance probability in the factual world to that in the counterfactual world:\n$$ RR = \\frac{p_1}{p_0} $$\n\nBy the invariance property of maximum likelihood estimators, the MLE of a function of parameters is that same function applied to the MLEs of the parameters. Thus, the MLE of the Risk Ratio, denoted $\\widehat{RR}$, is:\n$$ \\widehat{RR} = \\frac{\\hat{p}_1}{\\hat{p}_0} = \\frac{n_1/N_1}{n_0/N_0} $$\n\nUsing the provided data, $N_1 = 50,000$, $n_1 = 2,100$, $N_0 = 50,000$, and $n_0 = 200$:\n$$ \\hat{p}_1 = \\frac{2,100}{50,000} = 0.042 $$\n$$ \\hat{p}_0 = \\frac{200}{50,000} = 0.004 $$\n$$ \\widehat{RR} = \\frac{0.042}{0.004} = 10.5 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\widehat{RR} = 10.50$.\n\nThe second task is to derive the asymptotic standard error of the natural logarithm of the estimated Risk Ratio, $\\text{SE}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR}))$.\nLet $g(p_1, p_0) = \\ln(RR) = \\ln(\\frac{p_1}{p_0}) = \\ln(p_1) - \\ln(p_0)$. We are interested in the standard error of $g(\\hat{p}_1, \\hat{p}_0) = \\ln(\\widehat{RR})$.\n\nAccording to the central limit theorem, for large sample sizes, the distributions of the sample proportions $\\hat{p}_1$ and $\\hat{p}_0$ are approximately Gaussian:\n$$ \\hat{p}_1 \\approx \\mathcal{N}\\left(p_1, \\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{N_1}\\right) $$\n$$ \\hat{p}_0 \\approx \\mathcal{N}\\left(p_0, \\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{N_0}\\right) $$\nThe variances are $\\text{Var}(\\hat{p}_1) = \\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{N_1}$ and $\\text{Var}(\\hat{p}_0) = \\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{N_0}$. Since the factual and counterfactual simulations are independent, $\\text{Cov}(\\hat{p}_1, \\hat{p}_0) = 0$.\n\nWe use the multivariate Delta method to find the asymptotic variance of $\\ln(\\widehat{RR})$. For a function $g(\\hat{\\theta}_1, \\hat{\\theta}_2)$ of two independent estimators, the variance is approximated by:\n$$ \\text{Var}(g(\\hat{\\theta}_1, \\hat{\\theta}_2)) \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\theta_1}\\right)^2 \\text{Var}(\\hat{\\theta}_1) + \\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\theta_2}\\right)^2 \\text{Var}(\\hat{\\theta}_2) $$\nwhere the partial derivatives are evaluated at the true parameter values $(\\theta_1, \\theta_2)$.\n\nIn our case, $\\theta_1 = p_1$, $\\theta_2 = p_0$, and $g(p_1, p_0) = \\ln(p_1) - \\ln(p_0)$. The partial derivatives are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial p_1} = \\frac{1}{p_1} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial p_0} = -\\frac{1}{p_0} $$\n\nSubstituting these into the Delta method formula:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) \\approx \\left(\\frac{1}{p_1}\\right)^2 \\text{Var}(\\hat{p}_1) + \\left(-\\frac{1}{p_0}\\right)^2 \\text{Var}(\\hat{p}_0) $$\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) \\approx \\frac{1}{p_1^2} \\left( \\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{N_1} \\right) + \\frac{1}{p_0^2} \\left( \\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{N_0} \\right) $$\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) \\approx \\frac{1-p_1}{p_1 N_1} + \\frac{1-p_0}{p_0 N_0} $$\nThis is the asymptotic variance.

Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or unsound premises. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\nThe objective is to find the half-width of a $100(1-\\alpha)\\%$ confidence interval for $\\ln(\\widehat{RR})$ that is attributable solely to internal variability. The half-width, $W$, of a symmetric CI for an asymptotically normal estimator $\\hat{\\theta}$ is given by $W = z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\theta})$, where $\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\sqrt{\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\theta})}$ is the standard error and $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ is the upper $1-\\alpha/2$ quantile of the standard normal distribution. Here, our estimator is $\\hat{\\theta} = \\ln(\\widehat{RR})$.\n\nOur first step is to find the variance of the estimator $\\widehat{p}_i$ and decompose it into components related to sampling uncertainty and internal variability. We use the law of total variance:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(\\widehat{p}_i) = \\mathbb{E}[\\operatorname{Var}(\\widehat{p}_i | \\{p_{i,t}\\}_{t=1}^{N_i})] + \\operatorname{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[\\widehat{p}_i | \\{p_{i,t}\\}_{t=1}^{N_i}]) $$\nThe set of random probabilities $\\{p_{i,t}\\}_{t=1}^{N_i}$ is determined by the set of internal variability fluctuations $\\{\\eta_{i,t}\\}_{t=1}^{N_i}$.\n\nLet's analyze the two terms.\nThe conditional expectation of $\\widehat{p}_i$ given the sequence of probabilities $\\{p_{i,t}\\}$ is:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[\\widehat{p}_i | \\{p_{i,t}\\}] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{N_i}\\sum_{t=1}^{N_i}Y_{i,t} \\bigg| \\{p_{i,t}\\}\\right] = \\frac{1}{N_i}\\sum_{t=1}^{N_i}\\mathbb{E}[Y_{i,t} | p_{i,t}] = \\frac{1}{N_i}\\sum_{t=1}^{N_i}p_{i,t} $$\nThe conditional variance of $\\widehat{p}_i$ is:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(\\widehat{p}_i | \\{p_{i,t}\\}) = \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{N_i}\\sum_{t=1}^{N_i}Y_{i,t} \\bigg| \\{p_{i,t}\\}\\right) = \\frac{1}{N_i^2}\\sum_{t=1}^{N_i}\\operatorname{Var}(Y_{i,t} | p_{i,t}) = \\frac{1}{N_i^2}\\sum_{t=1}^{N_i}p_{i,t}(1-p_{i,t}) $$\nHere we have used the fact that the $Y_{i,t}$ are conditionally independent given the $\\{p_{i,t}\\}$.\n\nNow, we evaluate the two terms from the law of total variance.\n\n**Term 1: Sampling Uncertainty**\nThis term represents the uncertainty arising from the Bernoulli sampling process, averaged over the distribution of internal variability.\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[\\operatorname{Var}(\\widehat{p}_i | \\{p_{i,t}\\})] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{N_i^2}\\sum_{t=1}^{N_i}p_{i,t}(1-p_{i,t})\\right] = \\frac{1}{N_i}\\mathbb{E}[p_{i,t}(1-p_{i,t})] $$\nsince the $\\eta_{i,t}$ (and thus $p_{i,t}$) are identically distributed. We have:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[p_{i,t}(1-p_{i,t})] = \\mathbb{E}[p_{i,t} - p_{i,t}^2] = \\mathbb{E}[p_{i,t}] - \\mathbb{E}[p_{i,t}^2] $$\nWe know $\\mathbb{E}[p_{i,t}] = \\mathbb{E}[p_i + \\eta_{i,t}] = p_i + \\mathbb{E}[\\eta_{i,t}] = p_i$.\nAnd $\\operatorname{Var}(p_{i,t}) = \\operatorname{Var}(p_i + \\eta_{i,t}) = \\operatorname{Var}(\\eta_{i,t}) = \\sigma_i^2$.\nThe variance is also $\\operatorname{Var}(p_{i,t}) = \\mathbb{E}[p_{i,t}^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[p_{i,t}])^2$, so $\\mathbb{E}[p_{i,t}^2] = \\operatorname{Var}(p_{i,t}) + (\\mathbb{E}[p_{i,t}])^2 = \\sigma_i^2 + p_i^2$.\nSubstituting these back:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[p_{i,t}(1-p_{i,t})] = p_i - (\\sigma_i^2 + p_i^2) = p_i(1-p_i) - \\sigma_i^2 $$\nSo, the sampling uncertainty component is $\\frac{p_i(1-p_i) - \\sigma_i^2}{N_i}$.\n\n**Term 2: Internal Variability Uncertainty**\nThis term represents the uncertainty in the estimate $\\widehat{p}_i$ that comes from the fluctuations of the underlying probabilities $p_{i,t}$ around their mean $p_i$. This is the component the problem asks us to isolate.\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}_{IV}(\\widehat{p}_i) = \\operatorname{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[\\widehat{p}_i | \\{p_{i,t}\\}]) = \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{N_i}\\sum_{t=1}^{N_i}p_{i,t}\\right) $$\nSubstituting $p_{i,t} = p_i + \\eta_{i,t}$:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}_{IV}(\\widehat{p}_i) = \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{N_i}\\sum_{t=1}^{N_i}(p_i + \\eta_{i,t})\\right) = \\operatorname{Var}\\left(p_i + \\frac{1}{N_i}\\sum_{t=1}^{N_i}\\eta_{i,t}\\right) = \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{N_i}\\sum_{t=1}^{N_i}\\eta_{i,t}\\right) $$\nSince the $\\{\\eta_{i,t}\\}$ are independent across $t$:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}_{IV}(\\widehat{p}_i) = \\frac{1}{N_i^2}\\sum_{t=1}^{N_i}\\operatorname{Var}(\\eta_{i,t}) = \\frac{1}{N_i^2}\\sum_{t=1}^{N_i}\\sigma_i^2 = \\frac{N_i \\sigma_i^2}{N_i^2} = \\frac{\\sigma_i^2}{N_i} $$\nThis is the variance of the estimator $\\widehat{p}_i$ attributable solely to internal variability.\n\nNext, we find the variance of $\\ln(\\widehat{RR})$. We have $\\ln(\\widehat{RR}) = \\ln(\\widehat{p}_1) - \\ln(\\widehat{p}_0)$.\nAssuming $\\widehat{p}_1$ and $\\widehat{p}_0$ are independent (as they are from different climate states), the variance of the difference is the sum of the variances:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) = \\operatorname{Var}(\\ln(\\widehat{p}_1)) + \\operatorname{Var}(\\ln(\\widehat{p}_0)) $$\nTo find $\\operatorname{Var}(\\ln(\\widehat{p}_i))$, we use a first-order Taylor expansion of $\\ln(x)$ around the mean of the estimator, $\\mathbb{E}[\\widehat{p}_i] = p_i$. This is also known as the delta method.\n$$ \\ln(\\widehat{p}_i) \\approx \\ln(p_i) + \\frac{1}{p_i}(\\widehat{p}_i - p_i) $$\nTaking the variance of this approximation:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(\\ln(\\widehat{p}_i)) \\approx \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\ln(p_i) + \\frac{1}{p_i}(\\widehat{p}_i - p_i)\\right) = \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{p_i}\\widehat{p}_i\\right) = \\frac{1}{p_i^2}\\operatorname{Var}(\\widehat{p}_i) $$\nNow, we consider only the contribution from internal variability by substituting $\\operatorname{Var}_{IV}(\\widehat{p}_i)$ for $\\operatorname{Var}(\\widehat{p}_i)$:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}_{IV}(\\ln(\\widehat{p}_i)) \\approx \\frac{1}{p_i^2}\\operatorname{Var}_{IV}(\\widehat{p}_i) = \\frac{1}{p_i^2}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_i^2}{N_i}\\right) $$\nThe total variance of $\\ln(\\widehat{RR})$ due to internal variability is therefore:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}_{IV}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) \\approx \\operatorname{Var}_{IV}(\\ln(\\widehat{p}_1)) + \\operatorname{Var}_{IV}(\\ln(\\widehat{p}_0)) = \\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{N_1 p_1^2} + \\frac{\\sigma_0^2}{N_0 p_0^2} $$\nThe standard error due to internal variability, $\\operatorname{SE}_{IV}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR}))$, is the square root of this variance:\n$$ \\operatorname{SE}_{IV}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{N_1 p_1^2} + \\frac{\\sigma_0^2}{N_0 p_0^2}} $$\nFinally, the half-width of the two-sided $100(1-\\alpha)\\%$ CI is this standard error multiplied by the critical value $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$:\n$$ W_{IV} = z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{N_1 p_1^2} + \\frac{\\sigma_0^2}{N_0 p_0^2}} $$\nThis expression clearly shows that the half-width contribution from internal variability decreases as the number of realizations, $N_1$ and $N_0$, increases, scaling with $1/\\sqrt{N_i}$.",

The use of Normal distributions to model temperature anomalies is a common, albeit simplified, approach. The definitions of Risk Ratio (RR) and Fraction of Attributable Risk (FAR) are standard in the field. The provided parameters, representing a shift in the mean and an increase in variance, are described as \"scientifically plausible\" for a warming climate, which is consistent with findings in climate research.\n- **Well-Posed:** All variables, functions, and parameters are clearly defined. The question is specific, asking for the calculation of defined metrics under two different scenarios and a subsequent comparison. The setup allows for a unique, stable, and meaningful solution.\n- **Objective:** The problem is phrased in precise, technical language, free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\nThe problem statement passes all validation criteria. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, complete, and relevant to the specified topic. There are no identifiable flaws.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A full derivation and solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation from First Principles**\n\nThe exceedance probability for a normally distributed variable $X_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_i, \\sigma_i^2)$ above a threshold $u$ is given by:\n$$p_i(u) = \\mathbb{P}(X_i  u) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(\\frac{X_i - \\mu_i}{\\sigma_i}  \\frac{u - \\mu_i}{\\sigma_i}\\right)$$\nSince $\\frac{X_i - \\mu_i}{\\sigma_i}$ is a standard normal variable $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$, this becomes:\n$$p_i(u) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(Z  \\frac{u - \\mu_i}{\\sigma_i}\\right) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{u - \\mu_i}{\\sigma_i}\\right)$$\nwhere $\\Phi$ is the standard normal CDF.\n\nFor the baseline world, $i=0$, with $\\mu_0=0$ and $\\sigma_0=1$:\n$$p_0(u) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{u - 0}{1}\\right) = 1 - \\Phi(u)$$\nThe baseline CDF is $F_0(x) = \\Phi(x)$.\n\nFor the factual world, $i=1$, with $\\mu_1=0.8$ and $\\sigma_1=1.2$:\n$$p_1(u) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{u - 0.8}{1.2}\\right)$$\n\nThe risk ratio is therefore:\n$$\\mathrm{RR}(u) = \\frac{p_1(u)}{p_0(u)} = \\frac{1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{u - 0.8}{1.2}\\right)}{1 - \\Phi(u)}$$\n\n**1. Quantile-based Threshold Analysis ($u_q$)**\n\nFirst, we determine the threshold $u_q$. It is defined such that the baseline exceedance probability is $q=0.02$.\nThe mapping between $u$ and $q$ for the baseline is $p_0(u) = q$, which implies $1 - \\Phi(u) = q$, or $u = \\Phi^{-1}(1-q)$.\nFor $q=0.02$, we have $1-q=0.98$. The threshold $u_q$ is the $98^{th}$ percentile of the standard normal distribution.\n$$u_q = \\Phi^{-1}(0.98)$$\nUsing standard statistical tables or software, we find $u_q \\approx 2.0537$.\n\nBy definition, the exceedance probability in the baseline world for this threshold is $p_0(u_q) = q = 0.02$.\n\nNext, we compute the exceedance probability in the factual world, $p_1(u_q)$:\n$$p_1(u_q) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{u_q - 0.8}{1.2}\\right) \\approx 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{2.0537 - 0.8}{1.2}\\right) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{1.2537}{1.2}\\right) \\approx 1 - \\Phi(1.0448)$$\nUsing statistical tables or software for $\\Phi(1.0448) \\approx 0.8519$, we get:\n$$p_1(u_q) \\approx 1 - 0.8519 = 0.1481$$\n\nNow, we can compute the risk ratio at this threshold:\n$$\\mathrm{RR}(u_q) = \\frac{p_1(u_q)}{p_0(u_q)} \\approx \\frac{0.1481}{0.02} = 7.405$$\nRounding to two decimal places, $\\mathrm{RR}(u_q) \\approx 7.40$.\n\n**2. Absolute Threshold Analysis ($u_{\\mathrm{abs}}$)**\n\nThe absolute threshold is given as $u_{\\mathrm{abs}} = 1.5$.\n\nFirst, we compute the exceedance probability in the baseline world, $p_0(u_{\\mathrm{abs}})$:\n$$p_0(u_{\\mathrm{abs}}) = 1 - \\Phi(1.5)$$\nUsing statistical tables, $\\Phi(1.5) \\approx 0.9332$.\n$$p_0(u_{\\mathrm{abs}}) \\approx 1 - 0.9332 = 0.0668$$\n\nNext, we compute the exceedance probability in the factual world, $p_1(u_{\\mathrm{abs}})$:\n$$p_1(u_{\\mathrm{abs}}) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{1.5 - 0.8}{1.2}\\right) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{0.7}{1.2}\\right) \\approx 1 - \\Phi(0.5833)$$\nUsing statistical tables, $\\Phi(0.5833) \\approx 0.7201$.\n$$p_1(u_{\\mathrm{abs}}) \\approx 1 - 0.7201 = 0.2799$$\n\nNow, we compute the risk ratio at this threshold:\n$$\\mathrm{RR}(u_{\\mathrm{abs}}) = \\frac{p_1(u_{\\mathrm{abs}})}{p_0(u_{\\mathrm{abs}})} \\approx \\frac{0.2799}{0.0668} \\approx 4.1901$$\nRounding to two decimal places, $\\mathrm{RR}(u_{\\mathrm{abs}}) \\approx 4.19$.\n\n**3. FAR Comparison**\n\nThe Fraction of Attributable Risk is $FAR(u) = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{RR}(u)}$.\nThis function is strictly increasing with $\\mathrm{RR}(u)$ for $\\mathrm{RR}(u)  0$.\nWe have calculated:\n$$\\mathrm{RR}(u_q) \\approx 7.40$$\n$$\\mathrm{RR}(u_{\\mathrm{abs}}) \\approx 4.19$$\nSince $\\mathrm{RR}(u_q)  \\mathrm{RR}(u_{\\mathrm{abs}})$, it follows directly that $FAR(u_q)  FAR(u_{\\mathrm{abs}})$.\nFor completeness:\n$$FAR(u_q) = 1 - \\frac{1}{7.405} \\approx 1 - 0.135 = 0.865$$\n$$FAR(u_{\\mathrm{abs}}) = 1 - \\frac{1}{4.190} \\approx 1 - 0.239 = 0.761$$\nThe comparison $0.865  0.761$ confirms that $FAR(u_q)  FAR(u_{\\mathrm{abs}})$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n- **A. $\\mathrm{RR}(u_q) \\approx 7.40$, $\\mathrm{RR}(u_{\\mathrm{abs}}) \\approx 4.19$, and $FAR(u_q)  FAR(u_{\\mathrm{abs}})$.**\n  - The value for $\\mathrm{RR}(u_q)$ matches our derived value of $\\approx 7.40$.\n  - The value for $\\mathrm{RR}(u_{\\mathrm{abs}})$ matches our derived value of $\\approx 4.19$.\n  - The inequality $FAR(u_q)  FAR(u_{\\mathrm{abs}})$ matches our derived comparison.\n  - **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B. $\\mathrm{RR}(u_q) \\approx 4.19$, $\\mathrm{RR}(u_{\\mathrm{abs}}) \\approx 7.40$, and $FAR(u_q)  FAR(u_{\\mathrm{abs}})$.**\n  - The calculated values for $\\mathrm{RR}(u_q)$ and $\\mathrm{RR}(u_{\\mathrm{abs}})$ are swapped. This is incorrect.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C. $\\mathrm{RR}(u_q) \\approx 7.40$, $\\mathrm{RR}(u_{\\mathrm{abs}}) \\approx 4.19$, but $FAR(u_q) = FAR(u_{\\mathrm{abs}})$.**\n  - The risk ratios are correct. However, the FAR comparison is false. Since $\\mathrm{RR}(u_q) \\ne \\mathrm{RR}(u_{\\mathrm{abs}})$, it is not possible for $FAR(u_q)$ to equal $FAR(u_{\\mathrm{abs}})$ because $FAR$ is a strictly monotonic function of $\\mathrm{RR}$.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. $\\mathrm{RR}(u_q) \\approx 6.00$, $\\mathrm{RR}(u_{\\mathrm{abs}}) \\approx 4.19$, and $FAR(u_q)  FAR(u_{\\mathrm{abs}})$.**\n  - The value for $\\mathrm{RR}(u_q)$ is stated as $\\approx 6.00$, which contradicts our derivation of $\\approx 7.40$.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nThe analysis confirms that only option A is consistent with the derivation from first principles.",
