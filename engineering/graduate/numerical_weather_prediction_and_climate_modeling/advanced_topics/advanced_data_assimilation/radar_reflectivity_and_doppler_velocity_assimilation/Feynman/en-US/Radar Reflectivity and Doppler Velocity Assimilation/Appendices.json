Its stability and conditioning are critical for the convergence of minimization algorithms used in variational assimilation.\n\n1.  **Role of Positivity Constraints**: The derived partial derivatives depend on the state variables. Specifically, $\\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial q_{r}} = \\frac{Z}{q_{r}}$ and $\\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial \\lambda} = -3\\frac{Z}{\\lambda}$. As $q_{r} \\to 0^{+}$ or $\\lambda \\to 0^{+}$, the magnitudes of these derivatives tend to infinity. This leads to an ill-conditioned Jacobian matrix, causing numerical instability in the assimilation system's minimization procedure. Small changes or uncertainties in near-zero $q_r$ or $\\lambda$ values would lead to disproportionately large changes in the cost function gradient. Therefore, practical data assimilation systems must enforce positivity constraints, often through control variable transformations like assimilating $\\ln(q_{r})$ and $\\ln(\\lambda)$ instead of $q_{r}$ and $\\lambda$ directly. This maps the constrained variables to an unconstrained space and prevents the state from approaching these singularities. The constraint $\\mu > -1$ ensures that the arguments to the Gamma and digamma functions, $\\mu+4$ and $\\mu+7$, are always in a region where these functions are well-defined and smooth (far from their poles at non-positive integers), which is essential for numerical stability.\n\n2.  **Role of Parameter Scaling**: The state vector components $(q_{r}, \\mu, \\lambda)$ have different physical units and typically span vastly different orders of magnitude. This disparity can lead to the elements of the Jacobian $H'_{Z}$ having very different magnitudes. For example, the sensitivity of $Z$ to a change of $1.0$ in $q_{r}$ (in its own units) can be orders of magnitude different from its sensitivity to a change of $1.0$ in $\\lambda$. A matrix with columns of vastly different norms is often ill-conditioned. This can make the assimilation algorithm's optimization process highly inefficient or unstable, as the minimization would be dominated by the most sensitive parameter. To mitigate this, a preconditioning or scaling is applied to the control vector, often through a change of variables, $x' = B^{-1}\\delta x$, where $B$ is a diagonal scaling matrix representing the typical magnitudes or background error standard deviations of the control variables. The goal is to make the Hessian of the cost function with respect to the scaled variables closer to the identity matrix, which improves the condition number and accelerates the convergence of the minimization solver. In this context, using logarithmic sensitivities (elasticities) like $\\frac{\\partial \\ln Z}{\\partial \\ln q_{r}}=1$ and $\\frac{\\partial \\ln Z}{\\partial \\ln \\lambda}=-3$ demonstrates that transformations to logarithmic variables for $q_{r}$ and $\\lambda$ naturally help to balance the sensitivities.",

The cost function, $J$, quantifies the misfit between model-predicted radar observables (reflectivity $Z$ and Doppler velocity $v_r$) and their corresponding synthetic observations ($Z_\\text{obs}, v_\\text{obs}$). The gradient of this cost function with respect to the model state variables $(u, v, w, q_r)$ is essential for variational data assimilation methods, as it directs the minimization algorithm towards a model state that better fits the observations. The verification is a crucial step known as a gradient check, where the analytically derived gradient (the \"adjoint\" method) is compared against a numerical approximation obtained through finite differences.\n\nThe state vector is $\\mathbf{x} = (u, v, w, q_r)$, where $u$, $v$, and $w$ are the wind components in $\\mathrm{m/s}$ and $q_r$ is the rainwater mixing ratio in $\\mathrm{kg/kg}$. The cost function is given by:\n$$\nJ(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{Z(q_r) - Z_\\text{obs}}{\\sigma_Z}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{v_r(u,v,w) - v_\\text{obs}}{\\sigma_v}\\right)^2\n$$\nThe derivation and verification process proceeds as follows.\n\nFirst, we must establish the analytical forms of the forward operators, $v_r(u,v,w)$ and $Z(q_r)$, which map the model state to the observation space.\n\n**1. Doppler Velocity Operator, $v_r(u,v,w,\\theta,\\phi)$**\nThe Doppler radial velocity $v_r$ is defined as the projection of the wind vector $\\mathbf{v} = (u, v, w)$ onto the unit vector along the radar beam, $\\hat{\\mathbf{d}}$. With an elevation angle $\\theta$ (from the horizontal plane) and an azimuth angle $\\phi$ (from the positive $x$-axis), the Cartesian components of the beam's unit direction vector are $(\\cos\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\cos\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\sin\\theta)$. The projection is the dot product:\n$$\nv_r = \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{d}} = u \\cos\\theta \\cos\\phi + v \\cos\\theta \\sin\\phi + w \\sin\\theta\n$$\nNote that the reflectivity $Z$ is independent of the wind components $(u, v, w)$, and the Doppler velocity $v_r$ is independent of the rainwater mixing ratio $q_r$.\n\n**2. Reflectivity Operator, $Z(q_r)$**\nThe derivation of $Z$ as a function of $q_r$ requires several steps based on the provided microphysical assumptions.\nWe start with the assumed Marshall-Palmer drop size distribution, $N(D) = N_0 \\exp(-\\Lambda D)$.\nThe general form of the $n$-th moment of this distribution is given by the integral:\n$$\nM_n = \\int_0^\\infty D^n N(D) \\,\\mathrm{d}D = N_0 \\int_0^\\infty D^n e^{-\\Lambda D} \\,\\mathrm{d}D\n$$\nThis integral is related to the Gamma function, $\\Gamma(z) = \\int_0^\\infty t^{z-1} e^{-t} \\,\\mathrm{d}t$. With the substitution $t = \\Lambda D$, we find:\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty D^n e^{-\\Lambda D} \\,\\mathrm{d}D = \\frac{\\Gamma(n+1)}{\\Lambda^{n+1}} = \\frac{n!}{\\Lambda^{n+1}}\n$$\nThus, $M_n = N_0 n! / \\Lambda^{n+1}$.\n\nNext, we relate the slope parameter $\\Lambda$ to the rainwater mixing ratio $q_r$. The rainwater content $W$ (in $\\mathrm{kg/m^3}$) is given by $W = \\rho_a q_r$, where $\\rho_a$ is the air density. $W$ is also defined as the mass of all drops per unit volume, which corresponds to the third moment of the DSD:\n$$\nW = \\frac{\\pi \\rho_w}{6} \\int_0^\\infty D^3 N(D) \\,\\mathrm{d}D = \\frac{\\pi \\rho_w}{6} M_3\n$$\nSubstituting $M_3 = N_0 3! / \\Lambda^4 = 6 N_0 / \\Lambda^4$:\n$$\nW = \\rho_a q_r = \\frac{\\pi \\rho_w}{6} \\frac{6 N_0}{\\Lambda^4} = \\frac{\\pi \\rho_w N_0}{\\Lambda^4}\n$$\nSolving for $\\Lambda$ gives its dependence on $q_r$:\n$$\n\\Lambda(q_r) = \\left( \\frac{\\pi \\rho_w N_0}{\\rho_a q_r} \\right)^{1/4}\n$$\nThis relationship is valid for $q_r > 0$.\n\nThe radar reflectivity factor $Z$ is the sixth moment of the DSD:\n$$\nZ = \\int_0^\\infty D^6 N(D) \\,\\mathrm{d}D = M_6 = \\frac{N_0 6!}{\\Lambda^7} = \\frac{720 N_0}{\\Lambda^7}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Lambda(q_r)$ into the equation for $Z$:\n$$\nZ(q_r) = 720 N_0 \\left[ \\left( \\frac{\\pi \\rho_w N_0}{\\rho_a q_r} \\right)^{1/4} \\right]^{-7} = 720 N_0 \\left( \\frac{\\pi \\rho_w N_0}{\\rho_a q_r} \\right)^{-7/4}\n$$\nThis simplifies to the final forward operator for reflectivity:\n$$\nZ(q_r) = 720 N_0 \\left( \\frac{\\rho_a}{\\pi \\rho_w N_0} \\right)^{7/4} q_r^{7/4}\n$$\nFor $q_r \\le 0$, the reflectivity is physically $Z=0$.\n\n**3. Analytical Gradient (Adjoint) Derivation**\nThe gradient $\\nabla J = (\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial u}, \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial v}, \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial w}, \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial q_r})$ is computed using the chain rule. The cost function is a sum of two independent terms, $J = J_v + J_Z$.\n\nFor the wind components, the gradient of $J$ is simply the gradient of $J_v$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial u} = \\frac{\\partial J_v}{\\partial u} = \\frac{\\partial J_v}{\\partial v_r} \\frac{\\partial v_r}{\\partial u} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_v^2} (v_r - v_\\text{obs}) \\cdot (\\cos\\theta \\cos\\phi)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial v} = \\frac{\\partial J_v}{\\partial v} = \\frac{\\partial J_v}{\\partial v_r} \\frac{\\partial v_r}{\\partial v} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_v^2} (v_r - v_\\text{obs}) \\cdot (\\cos\\theta \\sin\\phi)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial w} = \\frac{\\partial J_v}{\\partial w} = \\frac{\\partial J_v}{\\partial v_r} \\frac{\\partial v_r}{\\partial w} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_v^2} (v_r - v_\\text{obs}) \\cdot (\\sin\\theta)\n$$\n\nFor the rainwater mixing ratio, the gradient of $J$ is the gradient of $J_Z$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial q_r} = \\frac{\\partial J_Z}{\\partial q_r} = \\frac{\\partial J_Z}{\\partial Z} \\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial q_r}\n$$\nThe first term is $\\frac{\\partial J_Z}{\\partial Z} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_Z^2} (Z - Z_\\text{obs})$.\nThe second term, the Jacobian of the reflectivity operator, is derived from $Z(q_r) \\propto q_r^{7/4}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial q_r} = \\frac{d}{dq_r} \\left[ C \\cdot q_r^{7/4} \\right] = C \\cdot \\frac{7}{4} q_r^{3/4}\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of proportionality. A more elegant form is obtained by noticing that $Z/q_r = C \\cdot q_r^{3/4}$. Thus, for $q_r > 0$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial q_r} = \\frac{7}{4} \\frac{Z(q_r)}{q_r}\n$$\nFor $q_r = 0$, the derivative is $0$.\nCombining these gives the gradient component for $q_r$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial q_r} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_Z^2} (Z(q_r) - Z_\\text{obs}) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{7}{4} \\frac{Z(q_r)}{q_r} \\right)\n$$\n\n**4. Finite-Difference Gradient and Verification**\nTo verify the analytical gradient, $\\nabla J_\\text{adj}$, we compute a numerical approximation, $\\nabla J_\\text{fd}$, using finite differences. For a state variable $x_i$ with perturbation $\\epsilon_i$, the centered difference approximation is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x_i} \\approx \\frac{J(\\mathbf{x} + \\epsilon_i \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_i) - J(\\mathbf{x} - \\epsilon_i \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_i)}{2\\epsilon_i}\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_i$ is the unit vector for the $i$-th component. This is used for $u, v, w$. For $q_r$, this formula is used only if the backward perturbation $q_r - \\epsilon_{q_r}$ is non-negative. If $q_r - \\epsilon_{q_r} < 0$, a one-sided forward difference is used to respect the physical boundary $q_r \\ge 0$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial q_r} \\approx \\frac{J(\\mathbf{x} + \\epsilon_{q_r} \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_{q_r}) - J(\\mathbf{x})}{\\epsilon_{q_r}}\n$$\nThe discrepancy between the analytical and numerical gradients is measured by the relative error:\n$$\n\\mathrm{rel\\_err} = \\frac{\\left\\|\\nabla J_\\text{fd} - \\nabla J_\\text{adj}\\right\\|_2}{\\left\\|\\nabla J_\\text{adj}\\right\\|_2 + \\delta}\n$$\nwhere $\\|\\cdot\\|_2$ denotes the Euclidean norm and $\\delta=10^{-16}$ is a stabilizer to prevent division by zero. A small relative error indicates that the analytical gradient (and by extension the adjoint model) is correctly implemented.\nThe computational procedure involves implementing these operators and gradients, processing each test case by generating synthetic observations from the \"true\" state, evaluating the cost function and its gradients at the \"analysis\" state, and finally computing the relative error.",
