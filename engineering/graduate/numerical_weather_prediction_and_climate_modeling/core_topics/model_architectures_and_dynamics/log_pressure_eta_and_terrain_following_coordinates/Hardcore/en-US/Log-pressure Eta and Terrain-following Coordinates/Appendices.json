            "problem": "Consider a dry, hydrostatic, two-dimensional atmosphere used in Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) and climate modeling. The atmosphere is assumed horizontally homogeneous in the $y$-direction, isothermal with constant temperature $T$, and governed by the hydrostatic balance and the Ideal Gas Law.

The terrain height is specified by $h(x)$, and the local surface pressure $p_{s}(x)$ at $z=h(x)$ is related to the sea-level reference pressure $p_{0}$ by the isothermal hydrostatic relation.

            "solution": "The user has requested the derivation of the geometric height $z(\\eta,x)$ and its horizontal slope $\\partial z/\\partial x$ for a constant-$\\eta$ surface in a specified hybrid coordinate system, followed by a numerical evaluation of the angle of this slope at a given point. The analysis begins with the fundamental equations provided.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between pressure $p$ and geometric height $z$ in an isothermal atmosphere. The hydrostatic balance is given by\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dz} = -\\rho g\n$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the air density and $g$ is the gravitational acceleration. The Ideal Gas Law for dry air is\n$$\np = \\rho R T\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the specific gas constant and $T$ is the constant temperature. We can express density as $\\rho = p/(RT)$ and substitute it into the hydrostatic equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dz} = -\\frac{p g}{R T}\n$$\nThis is a separable first-order ordinary differential equation. We can rearrange and integrate it:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{dp}{p} = -\\int \\frac{g}{RT} dz\n$$\nLet's define the atmospheric scale height $H \\equiv RT/g$, which is constant since $R$, $T$, and $g$ are constants. The equation becomes $d(\\ln p) = -dz/H$. Integrating between a reference level $(z_1, p_1)$ and a level $(z_2, p_2)$ gives:\n$$\n\\ln(p_2) - \\ln(p_1) = -\\frac{1}{H}(z_2 - z_1)\n$$\nor equivalently,\n$$\np_2 = p_1 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z_2 - z_1}{H}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the barometric formula for an isothermal atmosphere.\n\nNext, we find the expression for the surface pressure $p_s(x)$. The problem states that $p_s(x)$ at the terrain height $z=h(x)$ is related to the sea-level pressure $p_0$ at $z=0$. Using the barometric formula with $(z_1, p_1) = (0, p_0)$ and $(z_2, p_2) = (h(x), p_s(x))$, we get:\n$$\np_s(x) = p_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{h(x)}{H}\\right) = p_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{g h(x)}{RT}\\right)\n$$\n\nNow, we derive the expression for the geometric height $z(\\eta, x)$ of a constant-$\\eta$ surface. The definition of the $\\eta$ coordinate is:\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{\\ln(p(x,z)/p_t)}{\\ln(p_s(x)/p_t)}\n$$\nwhere $p(x,z)$ is the pressure at coordinate $(x,z)$ and $p_t$ is the constant top pressure. We can solve for $p(x,z)$ on a surface of constant $\\eta$:\n$$\n\\eta \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_s(x)}{p_t}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{p(x,z)}{p_t}\\right)\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{p_s(x)}{p_t}\\right)^\\eta = \\frac{p(x,z)}{p_t} \\implies p(x,z) = p_t \\left(\\frac{p_s(x)}{p_t}\\right)^\\eta\n$$\nWe can also use the barometric formula to relate the pressure $p(x,z)$ at height $z$ to the surface pressure $p_s(x)$ at height $h(x)$:\n$$\np(x,z) = p_s(x) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z - h(x)}{H}\\right)\n$$\nSolving for $z$:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{p(x,z)}{p_s(x)}\\right) = -\\frac{z - h(x)}{H} \\implies z(x,z) = h(x) - H \\ln\\left(\\frac{p(x,z)}{p_s(x)}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $p(x,z)$ in terms of $\\eta$ into this equation yields $z(\\eta,x)$:\n$$\nz(\\eta,x) = h(x) - H \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_t (p_s(x)/p_t)^\\eta}{p_s(x)}\\right)\n$$\nUsing logarithm properties:\n$$\nz(\\eta,x) = h(x) - H \\ln\\left(\\left(\\frac{p_s(x)}{p_t}\\right)^{\\eta-1}\\right) = h(x) - (\\eta-1) H \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_s(x)}{p_t}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nz(\\eta,x) = h(x) + (1-\\eta) H \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_s(x)}{p_t}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting $H=RT/g$ and the expression for $p_s(x)$:\n$$\nz(\\eta,x) = h(x) + (1-\\eta) \\frac{RT}{g} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_0 \\exp(-g h(x) / (RT))}{p_t}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nz(\\eta,x) = h(x) + (1-\\eta) \\frac{RT}{g} \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_0}{p_t}\\right) - \\frac{g h(x)}{RT} \\right]\n$$\n$$\nz(\\eta,x) = h(x) + (1-\\eta) \\frac{RT}{g} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_0}{p_t}\\right) - (1-\\eta) h(x)\n$$\n$$\nz(\\eta,x) = \\eta h(x) + (1-\\eta) \\frac{RT}{g} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_0}{p_t}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the geometric height $z$ of a constant-$\\eta$ surface.\n\nNext, we derive the horizontal slope of this surface, $\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}$ at constant $\\eta$. We differentiate the derived expression for $z(\\eta, x)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{\\eta} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left[ \\eta h(x) + (1-\\eta) \\frac{RT}{g} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_0}{p_t}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nSince $\\eta$, $R$, $T$, $g$, $p_0$, and $p_t$ are all constants with respect to $x$, the second term's derivative is zero.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{\\eta} = \\eta \\frac{d h(x)}{dx}\n$$\nThis result is remarkably simple. It indicates that the slope of a constant-$\\eta$ surface is simply the terrain slope $dh/dx$ scaled by the value of $\\eta$.\n\nNow, we evaluate this slope for the given parameters. The terrain is given by:\n$$\nh(x) = A \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L}x\\right)\n$$\nThe terrain slope is:\n$$\n\\frac{dh}{dx} = -A \\frac{2\\pi}{L} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L}x\\right)\n$$\nSo, the slope of the $\\eta$-surface is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{\\eta} = -\\eta A \\frac{2\\pi}{L} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L}x\\right)\n$$\nWe need to evaluate this at $\\eta = 0.5$ and $x = L/4$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{\\substack{\\eta=0.5 \\\\ x=L/4}} = -0.5 \\cdot A \\frac{2\\pi}{L} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L}\\frac{L}{4}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{\\substack{\\eta=0.5 \\\\ x=L/4}} = - A \\frac{\\pi}{L} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = -A \\frac{\\pi}{L} (1) = -\\frac{\\pi A}{L}\n$$\nThe problem provides the values $A = 500\\,\\mathrm{m}$ and $L = 50\\,\\mathrm{km} = 50 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{m}$. Note that constants $T, g, R, p_0, p_t$ are not required for this final calculation, due to the simplified structure of $z(\\eta,x)$ in an isothermal atmosphere.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{\\pi (500)}{50000} = -\\frac{500\\pi}{50000} = -\\frac{\\pi}{100}\n$$\nThe angle $\\theta$ that this surface makes with the horizontal is defined as $\\theta = \\arctan(\\partial z/\\partial x)$.\n$$\n\\theta = \\arctan\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{100}\\right)\n$$\nUsing a calculator to evaluate this expression in radians:\n$$\n\\theta \\approx \\arctan(-0.0314159265...) \\approx -0.031405762...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\n\\theta \\approx -0.03141\\,\\mathrm{radians}\n$$",

Using the ideal gas law $p = \\rho R T$, we get $\\alpha = \\frac{R T}{p}$, and therefore\n$$\nd\\Phi = -\\frac{R T}{p}\\,dp = -R T\\,d(\\ln p).\n$$\nThis is the continuous hydrostatic relation in log-pressure form. It shows that the geopotential change across a finite pressure interval depends on the layer temperature and the logarithmic pressure change.\n\nOn a Charney–Phillips staggering, temperature $T$ is stored at full levels and is taken to represent the layer-mean temperature between its two bounding half levels. For a single layer bounded by the upper half level with pressure $p_{k-1/2}$ and the lower half level with pressure $p_{k+1/2}$, with a layer-mean temperature $T_{k}$ assumed constant within the layer, integrating the above differential from the upper to the lower half level gives\n$$\n\\Phi_{k+1/2} - \\Phi_{k-1/2} \\;=\\; -\\int_{p_{k-1/2}}^{p_{k+1/2}} R T_{k}\\,\\frac{dp}{p} \\;=\\; -R T_{k}\\,\\left[\\ln p\\right]_{p_{k-1/2}}^{p_{k+1/2}} \\;=\\; -R T_{k}\\,\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{p_{k+1/2}}{p_{k-1/2}}\\right).\n$$\nRearranging to express the geopotential thickness (upper minus lower) yields\n$$\n\\Phi_{k-1/2} - \\Phi_{k+1/2} \\;=\\; R T_{k}\\,\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{p_{k+1/2}}{p_{k-1/2}}\\right).\n$$\nThis discrete layer relation exactly satisfies hydrostatic balance when $T_{k}$ is the layer-mean temperature co-located with the layer bounded by $p_{k-1/2}$ and $p_{k+1/2}$.
