Solving the full Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) at every point and for every wavelength is computationally prohibitive, so models rely on simplified but physically-grounded parameterizations. This exercise guides you through the fundamentals of the widely-used two-stream approximation, starting from first principles to derive the governing flux equations and then applying them to compute a key climate diagnostic: the top-of-atmosphere net radiation for a simplified atmospheric profile .",

            "problem": "You are implementing the radiation component within a global climate model using the two-stream architecture for a plane-parallel atmosphere. The goal is to obtain hemisphere-resolved flux equations from first principles and then compute a diagnostic top-of-atmosphere quantity for a specific atmospheric profile. Begin from the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) for a gray medium, using the fundamental statement that for intensity $I(\\tau,\\mu)$ in direction cosine $\\mu$, the RTE is $\\mu\\,\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial \\tau} = I - S$, where the optical depth $\\tau$ increases downward and the source function $S$ is the sum of thermal emission and scattering contributions. Define the single-scattering albedo $\\omega$ as the ratio of scattering to extinction, the Planck function $B(T)$, and recall that the upward hemispheric flux and downward hemispheric flux are $F^{\\uparrow} = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\int_{0}^{1} I(\\tau,\\mu)\\,\\mu\\,d\\mu\\,d\\phi$ and $F^{\\downarrow} = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\int_{-1}^{0} I(\\tau,\\mu)\\,\\mu\\,d\\mu\\,d\\phi$, respectively. Adopt the two-stream hemispheric (Eddington) closure such that each hemisphere is represented by a single characteristic direction and define the optical depth scaling so that thermal emission contributes $\\pi B(T)$ to each hemispheric flux equation per unit optical depth.\n\nTask 1 (Derivation): Under these assumptions, derive the coupled first-order ordinary differential equations governing $F^{\\uparrow}(\\tau)$ and $F^{\\downarrow}(\\tau)$ for a gray atmosphere. State clearly the role of $\\omega$ in the general form and show the reduction when scattering is negligible, $\\omega = 0$.\n\nTask 2 (Computation): Consider the thermal infrared (longwave) limit in which scattering is negligible, so $\\omega = 0$. Take a homogeneous, isothermal atmospheric layer of total optical depth $\\tau_{s}$ with temperature $T_{a}$ above a black surface (surface emissivity $1$) at temperature $T_{s}$. The top-of-atmosphere (TOA) boundary condition is absence of downward longwave from space, $F^{\\downarrow}(0) = 0$, and the lower boundary condition is $F^{\\uparrow}(\\tau_{s}) = \\sigma T_{s}^{4}$, where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and presented with sufficient information for a unique solution. The language, while containing some idiosyncratic phrasing regarding \"optical depth scaling\", can be consistently interpreted within the standard framework of radiative transfer theory. The problem is therefore valid.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of the Two-Stream Flux Equations**\n\nWe begin with the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) for a gray, plane-parallel atmosphere, given as:\n$$\n\\mu\\,\\frac{\\partial I(\\tau,\\mu)}{\\partial \\tau} = I(\\tau,\\mu) - S(\\tau)\n$$\nwhere $I$ is the intensity, $\\tau$ is the optical depth increasing downward, $\\mu$ is the cosine of the zenith angle, and $S$ is the source function. In this gray atmosphere, the source function includes thermal emission and isotropic scattering:\n$$\nS(\\tau) = (1-\\omega)B(\\tau) + \\omega J(\\tau)\n$$\nHere, $\\omega$ is the single-scattering albedo, $B(\\tau)$ is the Planck function (implicitly $B(T(\\tau))$), and $J(\\tau)$ is the mean intensity, defined as $J = \\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\int_{4\\pi} I d\\Omega$.\n\nThe two-stream approximation simplifies the radiation field by representing the intensity in the upward hemisphere ($\\mu>0$) by a single value $I^+(\\tau)$ and in the downward hemisphere ($\\mu<0$) by a single value $I^-(\\tau)$. This is equivalent to evaluating the RTE at two characteristic direction cosines, $\\pm\\bar{\\mu}$, where $\\bar{\\mu} \\in (0, 1)$.\nThe RTE thus becomes a system of two ordinary differential equations:\n$$\n\\bar{\\mu} \\frac{dI^+}{d\\tau} = I^+ - S \\quad (\\text{for } \\mu = \\bar{\\mu})\n$$\n$$\n-\\bar{\\mu} \\frac{dI^-}{d\\tau} = I^- - S \\quad (\\text{for } \\mu = -\\bar{\\mu})\n$$\nThe hemispheric fluxes are defined as integrals of the intensity. Under the two-stream assumption, these become:\n$$\nF^{\\uparrow}(\\tau) = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\int_{0}^{1} I(\\tau,\\mu)\\,\\mu\\,d\\mu\\,d\\phi = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\int_{0}^{1} I^+\\,\\mu\\,d\\mu\\,d\\phi = I^+ \\cdot 2\\pi \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\pi I^+\n$$\n$$\nF^{\\downarrow}(\\tau) = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\int_{-1}^{0} I(\\tau,\\mu)\\,\\mu\\,d\\mu\\,d\\phi = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\int_{-1}^{0} I^-\\,\\mu\\,d\\mu\\,d\\phi = I^- \\cdot 2\\pi \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\pi I^-\n$$\nFrom these, we express the intensities in terms of fluxes: $I^+ = F^{\\uparrow}/\\pi$ and $I^- = -F^{\\downarrow}/\\pi$. Note that with this definition, $F^{\\uparrow} \\ge 0$ and $F^{\\downarrow} \\le 0$.\n\nThe mean intensity $J$ can now be expressed in terms of fluxes. Assuming isotropic intensity within each hemisphere:\n$$\nJ = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\int_{0}^{1} I^+ d\\mu' + \\int_{-1}^{0} I^- d\\mu' \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(I^+ + I^-) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{F^{\\uparrow}}{\\pi} - \\frac{F^{\\downarrow}}{\\pi}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}(F^{\\uparrow} - F^{\\downarrow})\n$$\nSubstituting this into the source function expression:\n$$\nS = (1-\\omega)B + \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}(F^{\\uparrow} - F^{\\downarrow})\n$$\nNow, we substitute the flux-based expressions for $I^+$, $I^-$, and $S$ into the two-stream RTEs:\n$$\n\\bar{\\mu} \\frac{d}{d\\tau}\\left(\\frac{F^{\\uparrow}}{\\pi}\\right) = \\frac{F^{\\uparrow}}{\\pi} - \\left[(1-\\omega)B + \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}(F^{\\uparrow} - F^{\\downarrow})\\right]\n$$\n$$\n-\\bar{\\mu} \\frac{d}{d\\tau}\\left(\\frac{-F^{\\downarrow}}{\\pi}\\right) = \\frac{-F^{\\downarrow}}{\\pi} - \\left[(1-\\omega)B + \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}(F^{\\uparrow} - F^{\\downarrow})\\right]\n$$\nMultiplying both equations by $\\pi$ and simplifying yields:\n$$\n\\bar{\\mu} \\frac{dF^{\\uparrow}}{d\\tau} = F^{\\uparrow} - \\pi(1-\\omega)B - \\frac{\\omega}{2}(F^{\\uparrow} - F^{\\downarrow}) = \\left(1-\\frac{\\omega}{2}\\right)F^{\\uparrow} + \\frac{\\omega}{2}F^{\\downarrow} - \\pi(1-\\omega)B\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{\\mu} \\frac{dF^{\\downarrow}}{d\\tau} = -F^{\\downarrow} - \\pi(1-\\omega)B - \\frac{\\omega}{2}(F^{\\uparrow} - F^{\\downarrow}) = -\\frac{\\omega}{2}F^{\\uparrow} - \\left(1-\\frac{\\omega}{2}\\right)F^{\\downarrow} - \\pi(1-\\omega)B\n$$\nThe problem specifies to \"define the optical depth scaling\" such that the equations take a canonical form. This is achieved by defining a scaled optical depth $\\tau' = \\tau/\\bar{\\mu}$. With this definition, $d\\tau' = d\\tau/\\bar{\\mu}$, and thus $\\frac{d}{d\\tau} = \\frac{1}{\\bar{\\mu}}\\frac{d}{d\\tau'}$. Substituting this into the equations and canceling the factor of $\\bar{\\mu}$ (which is equivalent to dividing the equations by $\\bar{\\mu}$ and associating the result with the derivative with respect to $\\tau'$), we obtain the final coupled ODEs. For clarity, we drop the prime on $\\tau$, understanding that it is the scaled optical depth:\n$$\n\\frac{dF^{\\uparrow}}{d\\tau} = \\left(1-\\frac{\\omega}{2}\\right)F^{\\uparrow} + \\frac{\\omega}{2}F^{\\downarrow} - \\pi(1-\\omega)B\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dF^{\\downarrow}}{d\\tau} = -\\frac{\\omega}{2}F^{\\uparrow} - \\left(1-\\frac{\\omega}{2}\\right)F^{\\downarrow} - \\pi(1-\\omega)B\n$$\nThese equations show the role of $\\omega$. The terms proportional to $\\omega$ represent the scattering of flux from one hemisphere into the other, coupling the equations. The $(1-\\omega)$ factor modulates the strength of thermal emission.\n\nFor the case where scattering is negligible ($\\omega = 0$), these equations reduce to:\n$$\n\\frac{dF^{\\uparrow}}{d\\tau} = F^{\\uparrow} - \\pi B\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dF^{\\downarrow}}{d\\tau} = -F^{\\downarrow} - \\pi B\n$$\nIn this limit, the two flux equations are uncoupled.\n\n**Task 2: Computation of TOA Net Longwave Flux**\n\nWe use the derived equations for the non-scattering case ($\\omega = 0$). The atmosphere is isothermal at temperature $T_a$, so the Planck function $B$ is constant. The source term $\\pi B$ is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law for a blackbody, $S_a = \\pi B(T_a) = \\sigma T_a^4$. The governing ODEs become:\n$$\n\\frac{dF^{\\uparrow}}{d\\tau} = F^{\\uparrow} - \\sigma T_a^4\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dF^{\\downarrow}}{d\\tau} = -F^{\\downarrow} - \\sigma T_a^4\n$$\nThese are linear, first-order, inhomogeneous ODEs. The general solution for $F^{\\uparrow}(\\tau)$ is found by rewriting the equation as $\\frac{dF^{\\uparrow}}{d\\tau} - F^{\\uparrow} = -\\sigma T_a^4$. The integrating factor is $\\exp(-\\tau)$, yielding:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{d\\tau}(F^{\\uparrow}e^{-\\tau}) = -\\sigma T_a^4 e^{-\\tau} \\implies F^{\\uparrow}(\\tau)e^{-\\tau} = \\sigma T_a^4 e^{-\\tau} + C_1 \\implies F^{\\uparrow}(\\tau) = \\sigma T_a^4 + C_1 e^{\\tau}\n$$\nThe general solution for $F^{\\downarrow}(\\tau)$ is found from $\\frac{dF^{\\downarrow}}{d\\tau} + F^{\\downarrow} = -\\sigma T_a^4$. The integrating factor is $\\exp(\\tau)$, yielding:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{d\\tau}(F^{\\downarrow}e^{\\tau}) = -\\sigma T_a^4 e^{\\tau} \\implies F^{\\downarrow}(\\tau)e^{\\tau} = -\\sigma T_a^4 e^{\\tau} + C_2 \\implies F^{\\downarrow}(\\tau) = -\\sigma T_a^4 + C_2 e^{-\\tau}\n$$\nThe constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ are determined by the boundary conditions.\n1.  Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) at $\\tau=0$: $F^{\\downarrow}(0) = 0$.\n    $F^{\\downarrow}(0) = -\\sigma T_a^4 + C_2 e^0 = 0 \\implies C_2 = \\sigma T_a^4$.\n    Thus, the downward flux is $F^{\\downarrow}(\\tau) = -\\sigma T_a^4 + \\sigma T_a^4 e^{-\\tau} = \\sigma T_a^4 (e^{-\\tau}-1)$.\n2.  Surface at $\\tau=\\tau_s$: The upward flux equals the emission from the black surface at temperature $T_s$, so $F^{\\uparrow}(\\tau_s) = \\sigma T_s^4$.\n    $F^{\\uparrow}(\\tau_s) = \\sigma T_a^4 + C_1 e^{\\tau_s} = \\sigma T_s^4 \\implies C_1 = (\\sigma T_s^4 - \\sigma T_a^4)e^{-\\tau_s}$.\n    Thus, the upward flux is $F^{\\uparrow}(\\tau) = \\sigma T_a^4 + (\\sigma T_s^4 - \\sigma T_a^4)e^{\\tau - \\tau_s}$.\n\nWe need to compute the TOA net longwave flux, $F_{\\text{net}}^{\\text{TOA}} = F^{\\downarrow}(0) - F^{\\uparrow}(0)$.\nFrom the boundary condition, $F^{\\downarrow}(0) = 0$.\nThe upward flux at the TOA is:\n$$\nF^{\\uparrow}(0) = \\sigma T_a^4 + (\\sigma T_s^4 - \\sigma T_a^4)e^{0 - \\tau_s} = \\sigma T_a^4 + (\\sigma T_s^4 - \\sigma T_a^4)e^{-\\tau_s}\n$$\n$$\nF^{\\uparrow}(0) = \\sigma T_a^4 (1 - e^{-\\tau_s}) + \\sigma T_s^4 e^{-\\tau_s}\n$$\nThe net flux is therefore:\n$$\nF_{\\text{net}}^{\\text{TOA}} = 0 - F^{\\uparrow}(0) = -[\\sigma T_a^4 (1 - e^{-\\tau_s}) + \\sigma T_s^4 e^{-\\tau_s}]\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$T_a = 255\\,\\text{K}$\n$T_s = 288\\,\\text{K}$\n$\\tau_s = 2$\n$\\sigma = 5.670374419 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}\\,\\text{K}^{-4}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the blackbody emission terms:\n$$\n\\sigma T_a^4 = (5.670374419 \\times 10^{-8}) \\cdot (255)^4 \\approx 239.9525\\,\\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma T_s^4 = (5.670374419 \\times 10^{-8}) \\cdot (288)^4 \\approx 390.0965\\,\\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}\n$$\nThe atmospheric transmissivity term is:\n$$\ne^{-\\tau_s} = e^{-2} \\approx 0.135335\n$$\nThe atmospheric emissivity term is:\n$$\n1 - e^{-\\tau_s} = 1 - e^{-2} \\approx 0.864665\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $F^{\\uparrow}(0)$:\n$$\nF^{\\uparrow}(0) \\approx (239.9525) \\cdot (0.864665) + (390.0965) \\cdot (0.135335)\n$$\n$$\nF^{\\uparrow}(0) \\approx 207.4699 + 52.8028 \\approx 260.2727\\,\\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}\n$$\nThe TOA net flux is the negative of this value:\n$$\nF_{\\text{net}}^{\\text{TOA}} = -F^{\\uparrow}(0) \\approx -260.2727\\,\\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $-260.3$.",

            "problem": "Consider an atmospheric model that uses a terrain-following hybrid pressure coordinate defined by the mapping $p(\\eta,x,y,t) = A(\\eta) + B(\\eta)\\,p_{s}(x,y,t)$, where $A(\\eta)$ and $B(\\eta)$ are prescribed dimensionless functions of the vertical coordinate $\\eta$ only, and $p_{s}(x,y,t)$ is the surface pressure. Let the atmosphere be hydrostatic, with hydrostatic balance $\\partial p/\\partial z = -\\rho g$, equation of state $p = \\rho R T$, and geopotential $\\Phi = g z$, where $g$ is gravitational acceleration, $\\rho$ is density, $R$ is the specific gas constant for dry air, $T$ is temperature, and $z$ is geometric height.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the horizontal pressure gradient force (PGF) per unit mass in a terrain-following hybrid pressure coordinate system. The PGF per unit mass on a surface of constant geometric height $z$ is given as $-\\rho^{-1}\\nabla p|_{z}$, which can be written using specific volume $\\alpha = 1/\\rho$ as $-\\alpha \\nabla_z p$, where the subscript $z$ on the gradient operator indicates that $z$ is held constant. Our goal is to express this vector in the model's natural coordinate system $(x,y,\\eta)$, where gradients are taken along surfaces of constant $\\eta$, denoted by $\\nabla_{\\eta}$.\n\nThe transformation of the horizontal gradient of any scalar field $\\psi$ from a constant-$z$ surface to a constant-$\\eta$ surface can be derived using the chain rule. A change in $\\psi$ can be expressed in either coordinate system:\n$d\\psi = (\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x})_{\\eta} dx + (\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial y})_{\\eta} dy + \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\eta} d\\eta = \\nabla_{\\eta}\\psi \\cdot d\\mathbf{r} + \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\eta} d\\eta$\n$d\\psi = (\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x})_{z} dx + (\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial y})_{z} dy + \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial z} dz = \\nabla_{z}\\psi \\cdot d\\mathbf{r} + \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial z} dz$\nwhere $d\\mathbf{r} = dx\\,\\hat{i} + dy\\,\\hat{j}$.\n\nTo relate the gradients, we first need a relationship between $d\\eta$ and $dz$. From the functional relationship $z=z(x,y,\\eta)$, we can write its total differential as:\n$dz = (\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x})_{\\eta} dx + (\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y})_{\\eta} dy + \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial \\eta} d\\eta = \\nabla_{\\eta}z \\cdot d\\mathbf{r} + \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial \\eta} d\\eta$\n\nBy equating the two expressions for $d\\psi$ and substituting the expression for $dz$, we get:\n$\\nabla_{\\eta}\\psi \\cdot d\\mathbf{r} + \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\eta} d\\eta = \\nabla_{z}\\psi \\cdot d\\mathbf{r} + \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial z} \\left( \\nabla_{\\eta}z \\cdot d\\mathbf{r} + \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial \\eta} d\\eta \\right)$\n\nThis equation must hold for any independent variations $d\\mathbf{r}$ and $d\\eta$. Comparing coefficients of $d\\mathbf{r}$ gives the relationship between the horizontal gradients:\n$\\nabla_{\\eta}\\psi = \\nabla_{z}\\psi + \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial z} \\nabla_{\\eta}z$\nRearranging for our quantity of interest, $\\nabla_{z}\\psi$, we have:\n$\\nabla_{z}\\psi = \\nabla_{\\eta}\\psi - \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial z} \\nabla_{\\eta}z$\n\nNow, we apply this general transformation to the pressure field, $\\psi=p$:\n$\\nabla_{z}p = \\nabla_{\\eta}p - \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} \\nabla_{\\eta}z$\n\nWe are given the hydrostatic balance equation, $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} = -\\rho g$. Substituting this into the transformed gradient expression yields:\n$\\nabla_{z}p = \\nabla_{\\eta}p - (-\\rho g) \\nabla_{\\eta}z = \\nabla_{\\eta}p + \\rho g \\nabla_{\\eta}z$\n\nThe PGF per unit mass is $-\\alpha \\nabla_{z}p$.

Taking the horizontal gradient at constant $\\eta$ gives $\\nabla_{\\eta}\\Phi = \\nabla_{\\eta}(gz) = g\\nabla_{\\eta}z$, since $g$ is a constant. Substituting this into our PGF expression, we get:\n$-\\alpha \\nabla_{z}p = -\\alpha \\nabla_{\\eta}p - \\nabla_{\\eta}\\Phi$\n\nThe final step is to evaluate $\\nabla_{\\eta}p$ using the definition of the hybrid coordinate, $p(\\eta,x,y,t) = A(\\eta) + B(\\eta)\\,p_{s}(x,y,t)$. We take the gradient along a surface of constant $\\eta$.\n$\\nabla_{\\eta}p = \\nabla_{\\eta} \\left( A(\\eta) + B(\\eta)\\,p_{s}(x,y,t) \\right)$\nSince $\\eta$ is held constant, $A(\\eta)$ and $B(\\eta)$ are also constant with respect to the $\\nabla_{\\eta}$ operator.\n$\\nabla_{\\eta}p = \\nabla_{\\eta}(A(\\eta)) + \\nabla_{\\eta}(B(\\eta)\\,p_{s}) = 0 + B(\\eta)\\nabla_{\\eta}p_{s}$\nThe surface pressure $p_{s}$ is a function of $(x,y,t)$ only and does not depend on $\\eta$. Therefore, its gradient on a constant $\\eta$ surface is simply its horizontal gradient, which is denoted as $\\nabla p_s$ in the problem statement. Thus, $\\nabla_{\\eta}p_s = \\nabla p_s$.\nThis gives $\\nabla_{\\eta}p = B(\\eta) \\nabla p_s$.\n\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for the PGF, we obtain the final form:\nPGF = $-\\nabla_{\\eta}\\Phi - \\alpha \\nabla_{\\eta}p = -\\nabla_{\\eta}\\Phi - \\alpha B(\\eta) \\nabla p_s$\n\nThis expression is composed of two terms. The term $-\\nabla_{\\eta}\\Phi$ is the gradient of geopotential along the terrain-following $\\eta$-surface. This term arises directly from the fact that the coordinate surfaces are not level (i.e., not surfaces of constant geopotential) but have a slope that follows the underlying topography. The second term, $-\\alpha B(\\eta) \\nabla p_s$, is proportional to the surface pressure gradient. Over steep topography, both $p_s$ and the slope of the $\\eta$-surfaces vary sharply. This causes both $-\\nabla_{\\eta}\\Phi$ and $-\\alpha B(\\eta) \\nabla p_s$ to become large in magnitude. The true horizontal PGF is the small difference between these two large terms. Numerical computation of this difference using finite-difference schemes is susceptible to significant truncation errors, a well-known problem in atmospheric models using this architecture. The term that explicitly represents the contribution from the sloped coordinate surfaces is $-\\nabla_{\\eta}\\Phi$.",
