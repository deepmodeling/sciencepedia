All components are well-established within the field.\n    2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem seeks the speed of a special type of solution (a solitary wave). The existence and uniqueness of such a speed for a given structure is a well-posed mathematical question.\n    3.  **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise mathematical terms, free of subjectivity.\n    4.  **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained. The assumption of steady translation combined with the initial shape provides sufficient constraints to determine the speed $U$.\n\n*   **Verdict:** The problem is valid. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Drift Speed\n\nWe begin with the QG potential vorticity equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial q'}{\\partial t} + J(\\psi, q' + \\beta y) = 0\n$$\nExpanding the Jacobian term, $J(\\psi, q' + \\beta y) = J(\\psi, q') + J(\\psi, \\beta y)$. The second part is $J(\\psi, \\beta y) = \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial(\\beta y)}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial(\\beta y)}{\\partial x} = \\beta \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial q'}{\\partial t} + J(\\psi, q') + \\beta \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} = 0\n$$\nWe are given that the solution translates steadily in the zonal direction with speed $U$. This means the fields $q'$ and $\\psi$ are functions of $\\xi = x - Ut$ and $\\eta = y$. So, $q'(x,y,t) = q'(\\xi, \\eta)$ and $\\psi(x,y,t) = \\psi(\\xi, \\eta)$. The chain rule gives the transformations for the partial derivatives:\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = -U \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\xi}$, $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\xi}$, and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\eta}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the QG equation, we obtain the steady-state equation in the co-moving frame $(\\xi, \\eta)$:\n$$\n-U \\frac{\\partial q'}{\\partial \\xi} + J(\\psi, q') + \\beta \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\xi} = 0\n$$\nwhere the Jacobian is now taken with respect to $(\\xi, \\eta)$: $J(\\psi, q') = \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\xi}\\frac{\\partial q'}{\\partial \\eta} - \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\eta}\\frac{\\partial q'}{\\partial \\xi}$.\n\nTo find a solvability condition for $U$, we derive an integral constraint. We multiply the steady-state equation by $\\xi$ and integrate over the entire plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$:\n$$\n\\iint_{\\mathbb{R}^2} \\left( \\xi J(\\psi, q') + \\xi \\beta \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\xi} - \\xi U \\frac{\\partial q'}{\\partial \\xi} \\right) d\\xi d\\eta = 0\n$$\nWe analyze each term separately. For a localized anomaly, $\\psi$, $q'$, and their derivatives vanish at infinity.\n\n*   **Term 1:** $\\iint \\xi J(\\psi, q') d\\xi d\\eta$.\n    Using the identity $\\iint f J(g, h) d A = \\iint h J(f, g) d A$ for functions that decay at infinity, we set $f=\\xi$, $g=\\psi$, $h=q'$.\n    $$\n    \\iint \\xi J(\\psi, q') d\\xi d\\eta = \\iint q' J(\\xi, \\psi) d\\xi d\\eta\n    $$\n    The Jacobian $J(\\xi, \\psi) = \\frac{\\partial \\xi}{\\partial \\xi}\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\eta} - \\frac{\\partial \\xi}{\\partial \\eta}\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\xi} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\eta} - 0 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\xi} = \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\eta}$.\n    So, the first term is $\\iint q' \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\eta} d\\xi d\\eta$.\n\n*   **Term 2:** $\\beta \\iint \\xi \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\xi} d\\xi d\\eta$.\n    We integrate by parts with respect to $\\xi$:\n    $$\n    \\beta \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\xi \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\xi} d\\xi \\right) d\\eta = \\beta \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left( [\\xi \\psi]_{\\xi=-\\infty}^{\\infty} - \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\psi d\\xi \\right) d\\eta\n    $$\n    Since $\\psi \\to 0$ at infinity, the boundary term $[\\xi \\psi]$ vanishes. The term becomes $-\\beta \\iint \\psi d\\xi d\\eta$.\n\n*   **Term 3:** $-U \\iint \\xi \\frac{\\partial q'}{\\partial \\xi} d\\xi d\\eta$.\n    Similarly, integrating by parts with respect to $\\xi$ yields $U \\iint q' d\\xi d\\eta$.\n\nCombining the terms, the integral constraint is:\n$$\n\\iint q' \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\eta} d\\xi d\\eta - \\beta \\iint \\psi d\\xi d\\eta + U \\iint q' d\\xi d\\eta = 0\n$$\nNow, we use the structure of the anomaly. It starts as an axisymmetric Gaussian, $q'(x,y,0) = Q_{0} \\exp(-(x^2+y^2)/L^2)$. Since it translates without change of shape, its form in the co-moving frame is $q'(\\xi,\\eta) = Q_{0} \\exp(-(\\xi^2+\\eta^2)/L^2)$. This function is axisymmetric with respect to the origin of the co-moving frame. Let $\\rho = \\sqrt{\\xi^2+\\eta^2}$. Then $q' = q'(\\rho)$.\n\nThe invertibility relation $q' = \\nabla^2 \\psi - \\psi/R_d^2$ is a linear, isotropic differential equation (a modified Helmholtz equation). An axisymmetric forcing $q'(\\rho)$ will produce an axisymmetric streamfunction $\\psi(\\rho)$.\nWith $\\psi = \\psi(\\rho)$, the derivative with respect to $\\eta$ is $\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\eta} = \\frac{d\\psi}{d\\rho}\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial \\eta} = \\frac{d\\psi}{d\\rho}\\frac{\\eta}{\\rho}$.\nThe first integral in our constraint becomes:\n$$\n\\iint q'(\\rho) \\frac{d\\psi}{d\\rho}\\frac{\\eta}{\\rho} d\\xi d\\eta\n$$\nThe integrand is an odd function of $\\eta$, and the domain of integration $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is symmetric with respect to the $\\xi$-axis. Therefore, this integral is zero.\n\nThe integral constraint simplifies to:\n$$\n-\\beta \\iint \\psi d\\xi d\\eta + U \\iint q' d\\xi d\\eta = 0\n$$\nNext, we relate the integral of $\\psi$ to the integral of $q'$. We integrate the invertibility relation over the plane:\n$$\n\\iint q' d\\xi d\\eta = \\iint \\left( \\nabla^2\\psi - \\frac{\\psi}{R_d^2} \\right) d\\xi d\\eta\n$$\nThe integral of the Laplacian term can be converted to a boundary integral using the Divergence Theorem: $\\iint \\nabla^2\\psi d A = \\oint \\nabla\\psi \\cdot \\mathbf{n} ds$. Since $\\psi$ and its gradients vanish at infinity, this integral is zero.\nThus, we have the relationship:\n$$\n\\iint q' d\\xi d\\eta = -\\frac{1}{R_d^2} \\iint \\psi d\\xi d\\eta \\quad \\implies \\quad \\iint \\psi d\\xi d\\eta = -R_d^2 \\iint q' d\\xi d\\eta\n$$\nLet $I_{q'} = \\iint q' d\\xi d\\eta$. Since the initial anomaly is a non-trivial Gaussian ($Q_0 \\ne 0$, $L>0$), $I_{q'}$ is non-zero. Specifically, $I_{q'} = Q_0 \\pi L^2 \\ne 0$.\nSubstituting this relationship into the simplified integral constraint, we get:\n$$\n-\\beta \\left(-R_d^2 \\iint q' d\\xi d\\eta\\right) + U \\iint q' d\\xi d\\eta = 0\n$$\n$$\n(\\beta R_d^2 + U) \\iint q' d\\xi d\\eta = 0\n$$\nThis is the solvability condition for $U$. Since $\\iint q' d\\xi d\\eta \\neq 0$, the term in the parenthesis must be zero:\n$$\n\\beta R_d^2 + U = 0\n$$\nSolving for $U$, we find the exact expression for the zonal drift speed:\n$$\nU = -\\beta R_d^2\n$$\nThis result indicates that a localized, axisymmetric QG vortex on a beta-plane must drift westward at a speed equal to the maximum phase speed of linear Rossby waves (i.e., the speed of infinitely long waves). This specific speed prevents the vortex from radiating energy in the form of a Rossby wave wake, allowing it to maintain its shape.",

The question is specific and answerable through derivation. The problem is well-posed.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, objective, and standard scientific terminology. It is free from any subjective or ambiguous language.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique derivation. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe analysis focuses on the zonal-mean quantities, which are functions of the meridional coordinate $y$ only. The zonally averaged quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity, $\\overline{q}(y)$, is given by:\n$$ \\overline{q}(y) = \\overline{\\zeta}(y) + \\beta y $$\nThe zonal-mean relative vorticity, $\\overline{\\zeta}(y)$, is the zonal average of $\\zeta = \\nabla^2 \\psi = \\dfrac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial x^2} + \\dfrac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial y^2}$. Since the zonal average of any $\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$ term of a periodic or bounded function is zero, $\\overline{\\dfrac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial x^2}} = 0$. Thus, $\\overline{\\zeta}(y)$ simplifies to:\n$$ \\overline{\\zeta}(y) = \\frac{d^2 \\overline{\\psi}}{dy^2} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\overline{q}(y)$ gives the fundamental relationship for the zonal-mean state:\n$$ \\overline{q}(y) = \\frac{d^2 \\overline{\\psi}}{dy^2} + \\beta y $$\n\nThe problem states that due to mixing, the PV is homogenized into piecewise constant bands. In a given band, say for $y_i < y < y_{i+1}$, we have $\\overline{q}(y) = q_i$, where $q_i$ is a constant. The governing equation for the zonal-mean streamfunction $\\overline{\\psi}(y)$ in this band is:\n$$ q_i = \\frac{d^2 \\overline{\\psi}}{dy^2} + \\beta y $$\nThis is a second-order ordinary differential equation for $\\overline{\\psi}(y)$. We can rearrange it to solve for the second derivative of the streamfunction:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 \\overline{\\psi}}{dy^2} = q_i - \\beta y $$\n\nThe zonal-mean zonal wind is defined as $U(y) = - \\dfrac{d \\overline{\\psi}}{d y}$. To find the structure of $U(y)$, we can relate its derivative (the zonal wind shear) to the expression above:\n$$ \\frac{dU}{dy} = \\frac{d}{dy}\\left( - \\frac{d \\overline{\\psi}}{d y} \\right) = - \\frac{d^2 \\overline{\\psi}}{dy^2} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\dfrac{d^2 \\overline{\\psi}}{dy^2}$:\n$$ \\frac{dU}{dy} = - (q_i - \\beta y) = \\beta y - q_i $$\nTo find the structure of $U(y)$ within the band, we integrate the shear with respect to $y$:\n$$ U(y) = \\int (\\beta y - q_i) \\, dy = \\frac{1}{2}\\beta y^2 - q_i y + C_i $$\nwhere $C_i$ is an integration constant for the $i$-th band. This result shows that within each homogenized PV band, the zonal mean zonal wind $U(y)$ has a **quadratic** dependence on the meridional coordinate $y$.\n\nNext, we determine the location of the jets. Jets are local maxima (for eastward flow) or minima (for westward flow) of the zonal wind profile $U(y)$. The problem states that $U(y)$ is continuous across the interfaces $y_i$, but its derivative, the shear $\\dfrac{dU}{dy}$, is not. Let's analyze the jump in the shear at an interface $y = y_i$.\n-   For $y \\to y_i^-$ (approaching from the south), the shear is $\\dfrac{dU}{dy} = \\beta y_i - q_i$.\n-   For $y \\to y_i^+$ (approaching from the north), the shear is $\\dfrac{dU}{dy} = \\beta y_i - q_{i+1}$.\n\nThe jump in the shear across the interface $y_i$, denoted by $\\left[ \\dfrac{dU}{dy} \\right]_{y_i}$, is the value just north of the interface minus the value just south:\n$$ \\left[ \\frac{dU}{dy} \\right]_{y_i} = (\\beta y_i - q_{i+1}) - (\\beta y_i - q_i) = q_i - q_{i+1} = - (q_{i+1} - q_i) $$\nUsing the definition of the PV jump, $\\Delta q_i = q_{i+1} - q_i$, we get:\n$$ \\left[ \\frac{dU}{dy} \\right]_{y_i} = - \\Delta q_i $$\n\nAn eastward (westerly) jet corresponds to a local maximum in $U(y)$. For a sharp jet to be centered at the interface $y = y_i$, the shear $\\dfrac{dU}{dy}$ must change sign from positive to negative as we cross the interface from south to north.\n-   $\\dfrac{dU}{dy} > 0$ for $y \\to y_i^-$\n-   $\\dfrac{dU}{dy} < 0$ for $y \\to y_i^+$\nThis implies that the jump in the shear, $\\left[ \\dfrac{dU}{dy} \\right]_{y_i}$, must be negative.\n$$ \\left[ \\frac{dU}{dy} \\right]_{y_i} < 0 $$\nSubstituting our derived relationship:\n$$ - \\Delta q_i < 0 \\implies \\Delta q_i > 0 $$\nTherefore, eastward jets are located at the interfaces where the potential vorticity jump $\\Delta q_i$ is positive.\n\nSimilarly, a westward (easterly) jet corresponds to a local minimum in $U(y)$, requiring the shear to change from negative to positive. This implies a positive jump in shear, $\\left[ \\dfrac{dU}{dy} \\right]_{y_i} > 0$, which in turn requires a negative PV jump, $\\Delta q_i < 0$.\n\nSummary of results:\n1.  The zonal-mean zonal wind $U(y)$ is a **quadratic** function of $y$ in each homogenized PV band.\n2.  Jets are located at the interfaces $y_i$ where PV jumps occur.\n3.  An **eastward jet** occurs where the PV jump is **positive** ($\\Delta q_i > 0$).\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\nA. In each homogenized PV band, the zonal mean zonal wind $U(y)$ must be linear in $y$, and eastward jets coincide with negative PV jumps $\\Delta q_i < 0$.\n-   The statement that $U(y)$ is linear is incorrect. Our derivation shows $U(y)$ is quadratic.\n-   The statement that eastward jets coincide with negative PV jumps is incorrect. Our derivation shows they coincide with positive PV jumps.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nB. In each homogenized PV band, $U(y)$ must be quadratic in $y$, and eastward jets occur at latitudes where the PV jump $\\Delta q_i > 0$ across the step.\n-   The statement that $U(y)$ is quadratic in $y$ is correct, as shown by the derived form $U(y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\beta y^2 - q_i y + C_i$.\n-   The statement that eastward jets occur where $\\Delta q_i > 0$ is correct, as derived from the condition for a local maximum in $U(y)$.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\nC. The zonal mean zonal wind is uniform within each homogenized PV band, and jets occur at the midpoints of the bands irrespective of the PV jump sign.\n-   The statement that $U(y)$ is uniform (constant) is incorrect. It is quadratic. A uniform $U$ would imply $\\dfrac{d^2\\overline{\\psi}}{dy^2}=0$, which from the PV equation means $\\overline{q}(y)=\\beta y$. This contradicts the premise that $\\overline{q}$ is piecewise constant.\n-   The statement that jets occur at the midpoints of the bands is incorrect. They occur at the interfaces where the PV gradient is singular.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Meridional PV homogenization eliminates Rossby wave propagation entirely, so jets cannot form from a staircase-like PV profile.\n-   The claim that PV homogenization \"eliminates Rossby wave propagation entirely\" is an oversimplification. While the background PV gradient $\\dfrac{d\\overline{q}}{dy}$ is zero *within* the homogenized bands (suppressing wave propagation there), the PV gradients are concentrated at the interfaces, which act as waveguides. The system as a whole can still support waves.\n-   The conclusion that \"jets cannot form from a staircase-like PV profile\" is factually false. As demonstrated in the derivation, the staircase PV profile is the direct cause of the jets in this model. The sharp PV gradients at the interfaces sustain sharp zonal jets.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.",

            "solution": "The user wants to derive the leading-order relative phase speed error for a numerical scheme solving the linear barotropic vorticity equation.\n\nFirst, the problem is validated.\n\n**Step 1: Extracted Givens**\n- **Governing Equation**: The linear barotropic vorticity equation on a midlatitude beta-plane is given by $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left(\\nabla^{2}\\psi\\right) + \\beta\\,\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} = 0$, for a streamfunction $\\psi(x,y,t)$. $\\beta$ is a constant.\n- **Continuous Solution Form**: A plane-wave solution is assumed, $\\psi(x,y,t) = \\Re\\{\\hat{\\psi}\\,\\exp[i(k x + \\ell y - \\omega t)]\\}$, with real wavenumbers $k$ and $\\ell$, and real frequency $\\omega$.\n- **Continuous Definitions**: Total wavenumber squared $K^{2} \\equiv k^{2} + \\ell^{2}$ and phase speed $c_{p} \\equiv \\omega/k$.\n- **Numerical Discretization**: A uniform grid with spacings $\\Delta x$, $\\Delta y$, and $\\Delta t$ is used.\n    - Time derivative: Leapfrog scheme, $\\frac{\\zeta^{n+1}_{i,j} - \\zeta^{n-1}_{i,j}}{2\\Delta t}$ for $\\zeta \\equiv \\nabla^{2}\\psi$.\n    - Zonal derivative: Second-order centered difference, $\\frac{\\psi^{n}_{i+1,j} - \\psi^{n}_{i-1,j}}{2\\Delta x}$.\n    - Laplacian: Standard five-point stencil.\n- **Discrete Solution Form**: A discrete normal mode is assumed, $\\psi^{n}_{i,j} = \\Re\\{\\hat{\\psi}\\,\\exp[i(k\\,i\\Delta x + \\ell\\,j\\Delta y - \\omega_{\\text{num}}\\,n\\Delta t)]\\}$.\n- **Assumptions**: Small-parameter assumption $|k\\Delta x| \\ll 1$, $|\\ell\\Delta y| \\ll 1$, and $|\\omega \\Delta t| \\ll 1$.

The derivation must retain terms up to order $\\Delta x^{2}$, $\\Delta y^{2}$, and $\\Delta t^{2}$, neglecting mixed higher-order products.\n\n**Step 2: Validation Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It concerns a standard analysis of numerical dispersion for Rossby waves, a fundamental topic in geophysical fluid dynamics and numerical modeling. All necessary information is provided, the assumptions are clearly stated, and the objective is precise. No flaws listed in the validation checklist are present.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe objective is to find the relative error $E = (c_{p}^{\\text{num}} - c_{p}) / c_{p} = \\omega_{\\text{num}}/\\omega - 1$. This requires deriving the exact continuous dispersion relation for $\\omega$ and the numerical dispersion relation for $\\omega_{\\text{num}}$.\n\n**1. Continuous Dispersion Relation**\nWe substitute the continuous plane-wave solution $\\psi(x,y,t) = \\hat{\\psi}\\,\\exp[i(k x + \\ell y - \\omega t)]$ into the governing equation $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left(\\nabla^{2}\\psi\\right) + \\beta\\,\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} = 0$.\nThe derivatives of $\\psi$ are:\n$\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} = ik\\psi$\n$\\nabla^{2}\\psi = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial y^2} = (ik)^2\\psi + (i\\ell)^2\\psi = -(k^2+\\ell^2)\\psi = -K^2\\psi$\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(\\nabla^2\\psi) = -K^2 \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t} = -K^2(-i\\omega\\psi) = i\\omega K^2\\psi$\nSubstituting these into the governing equation yields:\n$$\ni\\omega K^2\\psi + \\beta(ik\\psi) = 0\n$$\nDividing by $i\\psi$ (which is non-trivial), we obtain the exact dispersion relation for Rossby waves:\n$$\n\\omega K^2 + \\beta k = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\omega = -\\frac{\\beta k}{K^2} = -\\frac{\\beta k}{k^2 + \\ell^2}\n$$\nThe exact phase speed $c_{p}$ is therefore:\n$$\nc_{p} = \\frac{\\omega}{k} = -\\frac{\\beta}{K^2} = -\\frac{\\beta}{k^2 + \\ell^2}\n$$\n\n**2. Numerical Dispersion Relation**\nNext, we discretize the governing equation. Let $\\psi^n_{i,j}$ denote the streamfunction at time $t_n=n\\Delta t$ and grid point $(x_i, y_j) = (i\\Delta x, j\\Delta y)$.\nThe discretized equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\nabla_h^2\\psi^{n+1}_{i,j} - \\nabla_h^2\\psi^{n-1}_{i,j}}{2\\Delta t} + \\beta \\frac{\\psi^{n}_{i+1,j} - \\psi^{n}_{i-1,j}}{2\\Delta x} = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\nabla_h^2$ represents the five-point Laplacian stencil:\n$$\n\\nabla_h^2\\psi_{i,j} = \\frac{\\psi_{i+1,j} - 2\\psi_{i,j} + \\psi_{i-1,j}}{(\\Delta x)^2} + \\frac{\\psi_{i,j+1} - 2\\psi_{i,j} + \\psi_{i,j-1}}{(\\Delta y)^2}\n$$\nWe substitute the discrete normal mode solution $\\psi^{n}_{i,j} = \\hat{\\psi}\\,\\exp[i(k x_i + \\ell y_j - \\omega_{\\text{num}} t_n)]$ into the discrete equation. We analyze the effect of each discrete operator on this mode.\nThe zonal advection term becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\psi^{n}_{i+1,j} - \\psi^{n}_{i-1,j}}{2\\Delta x} = \\frac{\\exp(ik\\Delta x) - \\exp(-ik\\Delta x)}{2\\Delta x} \\psi^n_{i,j} = \\frac{2i\\sin(k\\Delta x)}{2\\Delta x} \\psi^n_{i,j} = \\frac{i\\sin(k\\Delta x)}{\\Delta x} \\psi^n_{i,j}\n$$\nThe discrete Laplacian operator applied to $\\psi^n_{i,j}$ gives:\n$$\n\\nabla_h^2\\psi^n_{i,j} = \\left[ \\frac{\\exp(ik\\Delta x) - 2 + \\exp(-ik\\Delta x)}{(\\Delta x)^2} + \\frac{\\exp(i\\ell\\Delta y) - 2 + \\exp(-i\\ell\\Delta y)}{(\\Delta y)^2} \\right] \\psi^n_{i,j}\n$$\nUsing the identity $\\cos\\theta-1 = -2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\nabla_h^2\\psi^n_{i,j} = \\left[ -\\frac{4\\sin^2(k\\Delta x/2)}{(\\Delta x)^2} - \\frac{4\\sin^2(\\ell\\Delta y/2)}{(\\Delta y)^2} \\right] \\psi^n_{i,j} \\equiv -\\hat{K}^2 \\psi^n_{i,j}\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{K}^2$ is the squared numerical total wavenumber.\nThe time-differencing term in the discrete equation involves $\\nabla_h^2\\psi^{n\\pm 1}_{i,j} = -\\hat{K}^2 \\psi^{n\\pm 1}_{i,j}$. The time shifts are $\\psi^{n\\pm 1}_{i,j} = \\exp(\\mp i\\omega_{\\text{num}}\\Delta t)\\psi^n_{i,j}$. So the term becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\nabla_h^2\\psi^{n+1}_{i,j} - \\nabla_h^2\\psi^{n-1}_{i,j}}{2\\Delta t} = \\frac{-\\hat{K}^2(\\exp(-i\\omega_{\\text{num}}\\Delta t) - \\exp(i\\omega_{\\text{num}}\\Delta t))}{2\\Delta t} \\psi^n_{i,j} = \\frac{-\\hat{K}^2(-2i\\sin(\\omega_{\\text{num}}\\Delta t))}{2\\Delta t} \\psi^n_{i,j} = \\frac{i\\hat{K}^2\\sin(\\omega_{\\text{num}}\\Delta t)}{\\Delta t} \\psi^n_{i,j}\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions back into the full discrete equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{i\\hat{K}^2\\sin(\\omega_{\\text{num}}\\Delta t)}{\\Delta t} \\psi^n_{i,j} + \\beta \\frac{i\\sin(k\\Delta x)}{\\Delta x} \\psi^n_{i,j} = 0\n$$\nDividing by $i\\psi^n_{i,j}$ leads to the numerical dispersion relation:\n$$\n\\sin(\\omega_{\\text{num}}\\Delta t) = - \\frac{\\beta \\Delta t}{\\hat{K}^2} \\frac{\\sin(k\\Delta x)}{\\Delta x}\n$$\n\n**3. Taylor Series Expansions**\nWe now apply the small-parameter assumptions ($|k\\Delta x|\\ll 1$, $|\\ell\\Delta y|\\ll 1$, $|\\omega\\Delta t|\\ll 1$) to find an approximation for $\\omega_{\\text{num}}$. We use the Taylor series $\\sin(z) \\approx z - z^3/6$ and $\\arcsin(u) \\approx u + u^3/6$.\nFirst, expand the discrete spatial operators up to second order in grid spacing:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sin(k\\Delta x)}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{k\\Delta x - (k\\Delta x)^3/6 + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta x^5)}{\\Delta x} = k\\left(1 - \\frac{k^2\\Delta x^2}{6}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{K}^2 = \\frac{4\\sin^2(k\\Delta x/2)}{(\\Delta x)^2} + \\frac{4\\sin^2(\\ell\\Delta y/2)}{(\\Delta y)^2}\n$$\nUsing $\\sin^2(z/2) = (z/2 - (z/2)^3/6 + \\dots)^2 = z^2/4 - z^4/48 + \\mathcal{O}(z^6)$:\n$$\n\\hat{K}^2 = \\frac{4}{(\\Delta x)^2}\\left(\\frac{(k\\Delta x)^2}{4} - \\frac{(k\\Delta x)^4}{48}\\right) + \\frac{4}{(\\Delta y)^2}\\left(\\frac{(\\ell\\Delta y)^2}{4} - \\frac{(\\ell\\Delta y)^4}{48}\\right) = \\left(k^2 - \\frac{k^4\\Delta x^2}{12}\\right) + \\left(\\ell^2 - \\frac{\\ell^4\\Delta y^2}{12}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{K}^2 = (k^2+\\ell^2) - \\frac{1}{12}(k^4\\Delta x^2 + \\ell^4\\Delta y^2) = K^2\\left(1 - \\frac{k^4\\Delta x^2 + \\ell^4\\Delta y^2}{12K^2}\\right)\n$$\nUsing $(1-x)^{-1} \\approx 1+x$ for small $x$, we find the inverse:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\hat{K}^2} \\approx \\frac{1}{K^2}\\left(1 + \\frac{k^4\\Delta x^2 + \\ell^4\\Delta y^2}{12K^2}\\right)\n$$\nNow we assemble the right-hand side (RHS) of the numerical dispersion relation:\n$$\n\\text{RHS} = - \\beta \\Delta t \\left[k\\left(1 - \\frac{k^2\\Delta x^2}{6}\\right)\\right] \\left[\\frac{1}{K^2}\\left(1 + \\frac{k^4\\Delta x^2 + \\ell^4\\Delta y^2}{12K^2}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\text{RHS} \\approx -\\frac{\\beta k \\Delta t}{K^2} \\left(1 - \\frac{k^2\\Delta x^2}{6}\\right) \\left(1 + \\frac{k^4\\Delta x^2 + \\ell^4\\Delta y^2}{12K^2}\\right)\n$$\nSince $\\omega = -\\beta k/K^2$, we have $\\text{RHS} \\approx \\omega\\Delta t(1 - \\frac{k^2\\Delta x^2}{6} + \\frac{k^4\\Delta x^2 + \\ell^4\\Delta y^2}{12K^2})$, where we have neglected products of $\\Delta^2$ terms.\n\n**4. Solving for Numerical Frequency and Error**\nWe have $\\sin(\\omega_{\\text{num}}\\Delta t) \\approx \\text{RHS}$. For the physical mode, we take the principal value of the arcsin:\n$$\n\\omega_{\\text{num}}\\Delta t \\approx \\arcsin(\\text{RHS}) \\approx \\text{RHS} + \\frac{1}{6}(\\text{RHS})^3\n$$\nTo the required order, $(\\text{RHS})^3 \\approx (\\omega\\Delta t)^3$.\n$$\n\\omega_{\\text{num}}\\Delta t \\approx \\omega\\Delta t\\left(1 - \\frac{k^2\\Delta x^2}{6} + \\frac{k^4\\Delta x^2 + \\ell^4\\Delta y^2}{12K^2}\\right) + \\frac{(\\omega\\Delta t)^3}{6}\n$$\nDividing by $\\Delta t$ gives $\\omega_{\\text{num}}$:\n$$\n\\omega_{\\text{num}} \\approx \\omega\\left(1 - \\frac{k^2\\Delta x^2}{6} + \\frac{k^4\\Delta x^2 + \\ell^4\\Delta y^2}{12K^2}\\right) + \\frac{\\omega^3\\Delta t^2}{6}\n$$\nThe relative error in frequency is $\\omega_{\\text{num}}/\\omega - 1$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\omega_{\\text{num}}}{\\omega} - 1 \\approx - \\frac{k^2\\Delta x^2}{6} + \\frac{k^4\\Delta x^2 + \\ell^4\\Delta y^2}{12K^2} + \\frac{\\omega^2\\Delta t^2}{6}\n$$\nThis is equal to the relative phase speed error $E = (c_p^{\\text{num}}-c_p)/c_p = (\\omega_{\\text{num}}/k - \\omega/k)/(\\omega/k) = \\omega_{\\text{num}}/\\omega - 1$.\nFinally, we substitute $\\omega^2 = (\\frac{-\\beta k}{K^2})^2 = \\frac{\\beta^2k^2}{K^4}$ and $K^2 = k^2+\\ell^2$:\n$$\nE \\approx - \\frac{k^2\\Delta x^2}{6} + \\frac{k^4\\Delta x^2 + \\ell^4\\Delta y^2}{12(k^2+\\ell^2)} + \\frac{\\beta^2 k^2 \\Delta t^2}{6(k^2+\\ell^2)^2}\n$$\nWe can combine the terms proportional to $\\Delta x^2$:\n$$\n\\left(-\\frac{k^2}{6} + \\frac{k^4}{12(k^2+\\ell^2)}\\right)\\Delta x^2 = \\frac{-2k^2(k^2+\\ell^2) + k^4}{12(k^2+\\ell^2)}\\Delta x^2 = \\frac{-k^4-2k^2\\ell^2}{12(k^2+\\ell^2)}\\Delta x^2 = -\\frac{k^2(k^2+2\\ell^2)}{12(k^2+\\ell^2)}\\Delta x^2\n$$\nThus, the final expression for the leading-order relative phase speed error is:\n$$\nE \\approx -\\frac{k^2(k^2+2\\ell^2)}{12(k^2+\\ell^2)}\\Delta x^2 + \\frac{\\ell^4}{12(k^2+\\ell^2)}\\Delta y^2 + \\frac{\\beta^2 k^2}{6(k^2+\\ell^2)^2}\\Delta t^2\n$$",
