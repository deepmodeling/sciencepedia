The Boussinesq approximation and the linear equation of state are standard, valid idealizations used in physical oceanography. The problem is well-posed; it provides all the necessary equations and constants to derive the requested expression. The terminology is precise and objective. There are no contradictions, missing pieces of information, or violations of physical laws. The request to express the final answer in SI units for a symbolic expression is interpreted to mean that the variables in the derived formula represent standard physical quantities in a consistent unit system (like SI), which does not invalidate the problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe derivation commences from the provided governing principles: geostrophic balance and hydrostatic balance.\n\nThe geostrophic balance equations describe the flow where the Coriolis force balances the pressure gradient force. Under the Boussinesq approximation, where density variations are neglected in the inertia terms, the constant reference density $\\rho_{0}$ is used. The northward component of the momentum equation, which defines the eastward geostrophic velocity $u_{g}$, is:\n$$\nf u_{g} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_{0}} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y}\n$$\nThe vertical momentum equation reduces to hydrostatic balance, where the vertical pressure gradient is balanced by the force of gravity:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} = -\\rho g\n$$\nThe problem asks for an expression involving the vertical shear of the eastward geostrophic velocity, $\\partial u_{g}/\\partial z$. We start by differentiating the geostrophic equation for $u_{g}$ with respect to the vertical coordinate $z$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} (f u_{g}) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\rho_{0}} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y}\\right)\n$$\nSince the Coriolis parameter $f$ and reference density $\\rho_{0}$ are constants, they can be moved outside the derivative:\n$$\nf \\frac{\\partial u_{g}}{\\partial z} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_{0}} \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial z \\partial y}\n$$\nThe problem states that the fields are sufficiently smooth to permit the commutation (interchange of order) of mixed partial derivatives. We apply this property to the pressure field:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial z \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial y \\partial z}\n$$\nThis allows us to rewrite the equation for the velocity shear as:\n$$\nf \\frac{\\partial u_{g}}{\\partial z} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_{0}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the hydrostatic balance equation, $\\partial p/\\partial z = -\\rho g$, into this expression:\n$$\nf \\frac{\\partial u_{g}}{\\partial z} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_{0}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left(-\\rho g\\right)\n$$\nThe gravitational acceleration $g$ is a constant, so it can be brought outside the partial derivative:\n$$\nf \\frac{\\partial u_{g}}{\\partial z} = \\frac{g}{\\rho_{0}} \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial y}\n$$\nThis equation is the thermal wind relation, linking the vertical shear of the zonal flow to the meridional density gradient. To express this in terms of temperature and salinity gradients, we use the provided linear equation of state:\n$$\n\\rho(x,y,z)=\\rho_{0}\\bigl[1-\\alpha\\bigl(T(x,y,z)-T_{0}\\bigr)+\\beta\\bigl(S(x,y,z)-S_{0}\\bigr)\\bigr]\n$$\nWe take the partial derivative of this equation with respect to $y$. The constants $\\rho_{0}$, $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $T_{0}$, and $S_{0}$ are not functions of $y$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left( \\rho_{0} - \\rho_{0}\\alpha T + \\rho_{0}\\alpha T_{0} + \\rho_{0}\\beta S - \\rho_{0}\\beta S_{0} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial y} = -\\rho_{0}\\alpha \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} + \\rho_{0}\\beta \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial y}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial y} = \\rho_{0} \\left( -\\alpha \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} + \\beta \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial y} \\right)\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this expression for the meridional density gradient $\\partial \\rho/\\partial y$ back into the thermal wind relation:\n$$\nf \\frac{\\partial u_{g}}{\\partial z} = \\frac{g}{\\rho_{0}} \\left[ \\rho_{0} \\left( -\\alpha \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} + \\beta \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial y} \\right) \\right]\n$$\nThe reference density $\\rho_{0}$ cancels out, yielding the final expression for the eastward thermal wind shear:\n$$\nf \\frac{\\partial u_{g}}{\\partial z} = g \\left( -\\alpha \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} + \\beta \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial y} \\right)\n$$\nThis equation explicitly provides the eastward thermal wind shear in terms of the specified variables. The variables are understood to be expressed in a consistent system of units, such as the International System of Units (SI).",

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the layer thickness gradient and the geostrophic wind shear from first principles.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Thickness Gradient Magnitude $|\\nabla(\\Delta z)|$**\n\nThe derivation begins with the hydrostatic relation and the ideal gas law.\nThe hydrostatic relation is given by:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}z} = -\\rho g $$\nwhere $p$ is pressure, $z$ is geometric height, $\\rho$ is density, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nThe ideal gas law for dry air is:\n$$ p = \\rho R_d T $$\nwhere $R_d$ is the gas constant for dry air and $T$ is the temperature (using the problem's assumption that $T_v \\approx T$).\n\nCombining these two equations by eliminating $\\rho = p / (R_d T)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}z} = -\\frac{p g}{R_d T} $$\nRearranging to express an infinitesimal change in height $\\mathrm{d}z$:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}z = -\\frac{R_d T}{g} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{p} $$\nThe thickness of a layer, $\\Delta z$, between two pressure levels $p_1$ (lower) and $p_2$ (upper) is found by integrating this expression:\n$$ \\Delta z = z_2 - z_1 = \\int_{p_1}^{p_2} -\\frac{R_d T}{g} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{p} = \\int_{p_2}^{p_1} \\frac{R_d T}{g} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{p} $$\nAssuming a layer-mean temperature $\\bar{T}$, which can be taken out of the integral, we obtain the hypsometric equation:\n$$ \\Delta z = \\frac{R_d \\bar{T}}{g} \\int_{p_2}^{p_1} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{p} = \\frac{R_d \\bar{T}}{g} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_1}{p_2}\\right) $$\nTo find the horizontal gradient of the layer thickness, we apply the horizontal gradient operator $\\nabla_p$ (gradient on a constant pressure surface) to $\\Delta z$. The terms $R_d$, $g$, $p_1$, and $p_2$ are constants.\n$$ \\nabla_p(\\Delta z) = \\nabla_p\\left[ \\frac{R_d}{g} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_1}{p_2}\\right) \\bar{T} \\right] = \\frac{R_d}{g} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_1}{p_2}\\right) \\nabla_p \\bar{T} $$\nThe problem states that there is a purely meridional temperature gradient. Let the poleward direction be the $y$-axis. The temperature decreases poleward, so the gradient vector is $\\nabla_p \\bar{T} = \\frac{\\partial \\bar{T}}{\\partial y} \\hat{\\mathbf{j}}$. The magnitude of this gradient is approximated as $|\\frac{\\partial \\bar{T}}{\\partial y}| \\approx \\frac{\\Delta T}{L}$.\nThe magnitude of the thickness gradient is therefore:\n$$ |\\nabla_p(\\Delta z)| = \\frac{R_d}{g} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_1}{p_2}\\right) \\left| \\frac{\\partial \\bar{T}}{\\partial y} \\right| = \\frac{R_d \\Delta T}{g L} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_1}{p_2}\\right) $$\n\n**2. Derivation of the Zonal Geostrophic Wind Shear Magnitude $|\\Delta u_g|$**\n\nThe derivation of the thermal wind relationship starts with the geostrophic wind equations on an isobaric surface:\n$$ u_g = -\\frac{g}{f} \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y} $$\n$$ v_g = \\frac{g}{f} \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x} $$\nwhere $u_g$ and $v_g$ are the zonal (x-direction) and meridional (y-direction) components of the geostrophic wind, and $f$ is the Coriolis parameter.\n\nThe vertical shear of the geostrophic wind is the difference in wind between two vertical levels. This can be expressed as a vector difference $\\Delta \\mathbf{v}_g = \\mathbf{v}_g(p_2) - \\mathbf{v}_g(p_1)$. For the zonal component:\n$$ \\Delta u_g = u_g(p_2) - u_g(p_1) = -\\frac{g}{f} \\left( \\frac{\\partial z_2}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial z_1}{\\partial y} \\right) = -\\frac{g}{f} \\frac{\\partial (z_2 - z_1)}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{g}{f} \\frac{\\partial (\\Delta z)}{\\partial y} $$\nFor the meridional component:\n$$ \\Delta v_g = v_g(p_2) - v_g(p_1) = \\frac{g}{f} \\left( \\frac{\\partial z_2}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial z_1}{\\partial x} \\right) = \\frac{g}{f} \\frac{\\partial (\\Delta z)}{\\partial x} $$\nFrom the hypsometric equation, we have $\\Delta z = \\frac{R_d \\bar{T}}{g} \\ln(p_1/p_2)$. Substituting this into the shear equations:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial (\\Delta z)}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left( \\frac{R_d \\bar{T}}{g} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_1}{p_2}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{R_d}{g} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_1}{p_2}\\right) \\frac{\\partial \\bar{T}}{\\partial y} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial (\\Delta z)}{\\partial x} = \\frac{R_d}{g} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_1}{p_2}\\right) \\frac{\\partial \\bar{T}}{\\partial x} $$\nSubstituting these into the expressions for $\\Delta u_g$ and $\\Delta v_g$:\n$$ \\Delta u_g = -\\frac{g}{f} \\left( \\frac{R_d}{g} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_1}{p_2}\\right) \\frac{\\partial \\bar{T}}{\\partial y} \\right) = -\\frac{R_d}{f} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_1}{p_2}\\right) \\frac{\\partial \\bar{T}}{\\partial y} $$\n$$ \\Delta v_g = \\frac{g}{f} \\left( \\frac{R_d}{g} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_1}{p_2}\\right) \\frac{\\partial \\bar{T}}{\\partial x} \\right) = \\frac{R_d}{f} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_1}{p_2}\\right) \\frac{\\partial \\bar{T}}{\\partial x} $$\nThe problem specifies a purely meridional temperature gradient, so $\\frac{\\partial \\bar{T}}{\\partial x} = 0$, which implies $\\Delta v_g = 0$. The wind shear is purely zonal.\nThe magnitude of the zonal geostrophic wind shear is:\n$$ |\\Delta u_g| = \\left| -\\frac{R_d}{f} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_1}{p_2}\\right) \\frac{\\partial \\bar{T}}{\\partial y} \\right| = \\frac{R_d}{f} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_1}{p_2}\\right) \\left| \\frac{\\partial \\bar{T}}{\\partial y} \\right| $$\nUsing the approximation $\\left| \\frac{\\partial \\bar{T}}{\\partial y} \\right| \\approx \\frac{\\Delta T}{L}$, we get:\n$$ |\\Delta u_g| = \\frac{R_d \\Delta T}{f L} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_1}{p_2}\\right) $$\n\n**3.

The assumptions, such as a uniform specific humidity on an $f$-plane, are standard idealizations for theoretical problems in this field. The value of specific humidity $q=0.015$ is physically realistic for the troposphere. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions and constants to arrive at a unique numerical answer. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Fractional Error in Hypsometric Thickness**\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the thermodynamic temperature $T$ and the virtual temperature $T_v$. The total pressure $p$ is the sum of the partial pressures of dry air, $p_d$, and water vapor, $e$: $p = p_d + e$. The total density $\\rho$ is the sum of the densities of dry air, $\\rho_d$, and water vapor, $\\rho_v$: $\\rho = \\rho_d + \\rho_v$. The ideal gas laws for the components are $p_d = \\rho_d R_d T$ and $e = \\rho_v R_v T$.\n\nThe density of moist air can be written as:\n$$\n\\rho = \\rho_d + \\rho_v = \\frac{p_d}{R_d T} + \\frac{e}{R_v T} = \\frac{1}{R_d T} (p_d + e \\frac{R_d}{R_v})\n$$\nUsing $p_d = p - e$ and the definition $\\varepsilon = R_d/R_v$:\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{1}{R_d T} (p - e + e/\\varepsilon) = \\frac{p}{R_d T} \\left(1 - \\frac{e}{p} + \\frac{e}{p\\varepsilon}\\right) = \\frac{p}{R_d T} \\left(1 - \\frac{e}{p}(1-\\varepsilon)\\right)\n$$\nFrom the problem's definition of virtual temperature, $p = \\rho R_d T_v$, we have $\\rho = p / (R_d T_v)$. Equating the two expressions for $\\rho$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{p}{R_d T_v} = \\frac{p}{R_d T} \\left(1 - \\frac{e}{p}(1-\\varepsilon)\\right) \\implies T_v = T \\left[1 - \\frac{e}{p}(1-\\varepsilon)\\right]^{-1}\n$$\nA more direct relationship uses the mixing ratio $r$. The mixing ratio $r = m_v/m_d = \\rho_v / \\rho_d$.\nThe ideal gas law for the mixture is $p = \\rho_d R_d T + \\rho_v R_v T$. We also have $p = \\rho R_d T_v = (\\rho_d + \\rho_v) R_d T_v$.\nEquating these two gives:\n$$\n(\\rho_d + \\rho_v)R_d T_v = \\rho_d R_d T + \\rho_v R_v T\n$$\nDividing by $\\rho_d R_d$:\n$$\n(1 + \\frac{\\rho_v}{\\rho_d}) T_v = T + \\frac{\\rho_v R_v}{\\rho_d R_d} T\n$$\nSubstituting $r=\\rho_v/\\rho_d$ and $\\varepsilon=R_d/R_v$:\n$$\n(1+r)T_v = T(1 + r/\\varepsilon) \\implies T_v = T \\frac{1+r/\\varepsilon}{1+r}\n$$\nThe problem states that the specific humidity $q$ is uniform. The mixing ratio $r=q/(1-q)$ is therefore also uniform and constant. Let us define a constant $C$ as the ratio of $T_v$ to $T$:\n$$\nC \\equiv \\frac{T_v}{T} = \\frac{1+r/\\varepsilon}{1+r}\n$$\nSince $\\varepsilon  1$ and $r0$, it follows that $C1$.\n\nNext, we derive the hypsometric thickness. The hydrostatic equation is $dp = -\\rho g dz$, which can be rearranged to $dz = -dp/(\\rho g)$. Using the definition of virtual temperature, $p=\\rho R_d T_v$, we substitute for density $\\rho=p/(R_d T_v)$:\n$$\ndz = -\\frac{R_d T_v}{g} \\frac{dp}{p}\n$$\nThe thickness of the layer between pressure levels $p_1$ and $p_2$ (with $p_1  p_2$) is found by integrating:\n$$\n\\Delta z_{T_v} = \\int_{p_1}^{p_2} dz = \\int_{p_1}^{p_2} -\\frac{R_d T_v}{g} \\frac{dp}{p} = \\frac{R_d}{g} \\int_{p_2}^{p_1} \\frac{T_v(p)}{p} dp\n$$\nThe quantity $\\Delta z_T$ is the thickness calculated by incorrectly using $T$ in place of $T_v$ in the formula:\n$$\n\\Delta z_T = \\frac{R_d}{g} \\int_{p_2}^{p_1} \\frac{T(p)}{p} dp\n$$\nSince $T=T_v/C$ and $C$ is a constant, we can write:\n$$\n\\Delta z_T = \\frac{R_d}{g} \\int_{p_2}^{p_1} \\frac{T_v(p)/C}{p} dp = \\frac{1}{C} \\left( \\frac{R_d}{g} \\int_{p_2}^{p_1} \\frac{T_v(p)}{p} dp \\right) = \\frac{1}{C} \\Delta z_{T_v}\n$$\nThe fractional error $\\delta$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{\\Delta z_T - \\Delta z_{T_v}}{\\Delta z_{T_v}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{C} \\Delta z_{T_v} - \\Delta z_{T_v}}{\\Delta z_{T_v}} = \\frac{1}{C} - 1\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C$:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{1+r}{1+r/\\varepsilon} - 1 = \\frac{1+r - (1+r/\\varepsilon)}{1+r/\\varepsilon} = \\frac{r - r/\\varepsilon}{1+r/\\varepsilon} = \\frac{r(1-1/\\varepsilon)}{1+r/\\varepsilon}\n$$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $\\varepsilon$ yields the final expression for $\\delta$:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{r(\\varepsilon-1)}{\\varepsilon+r}\n$$\n\n**Derivation of the Fractional Error in Wind Shear Magnitude**\n\nThe thermal wind equation relates the vertical shear of the geostrophic wind to the horizontal gradient of the thickness of the layer. The geostrophic wind shear vector between two pressure levels, $\\Delta \\mathbf{v}_g = \\mathbf{v}_g(p_2) - \\mathbf{v}_g(p_1)$, is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathbf{v}_g = \\frac{g}{f} \\mathbf{\\hat{k}} \\times \\nabla_p(\\Delta z)\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{\\hat{k}}$ is the vertical unit vector and $\\nabla_p$ is the gradient operator on a constant pressure surface.\n\nThe true shear, $\\Delta \\mathbf{v}_{g, T_v}$, is calculated using the correct thickness $\\Delta z_{T_v}$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathbf{v}_{g, T_v} = \\frac{g}{f} \\mathbf{\\hat{k}} \\times \\nabla_p(\\Delta z_{T_v})\n$$\nThe shear inferred from the incorrect thickness, $\\Delta \\mathbf{v}_{g, T}$, is:\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathbf{v}_{g, T} = \\frac{g}{f} \\mathbf{\\hat{k}} \\times \\nabla_p(\\Delta z_T)\n$$\nWe previously established that $\\Delta z_T = \\frac{1}{C} \\Delta z_{T_v}$. The problem states that specific humidity $q$ is horizontally uniform. This implies that the mixing ratio $r$ and, consequently, the factor $C = (1+r/\\varepsilon)/(1+r)$ are also horizontally uniform, i.e., they are spatial constants. Therefore, the gradient operator acts only on $\\Delta z_{T_v}$:\n$$\n\\nabla_p(\\Delta z_T) = \\nabla_p\\left(\\frac{1}{C} \\Delta z_{T_v}\\right) = \\frac{1}{C} \\nabla_p(\\Delta z_{T_v})\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the inferred shear:\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathbf{v}_{g, T} = \\frac{g}{f} \\mathbf{\\hat{k}} \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{C} \\nabla_p(\\Delta z_{T_v})\\right) = \\frac{1}{C} \\left(\\frac{g}{f} \\mathbf{\\hat{k}} \\times \\nabla_p(\\Delta z_{T_v})\\right) = \\frac{1}{C} \\Delta \\mathbf{v}_{g, T_v}\n$$\nThe inferred shear vector is a scalar multiple of the true shear vector. The fractional error in the magnitude of the shear is:\n$$\n\\frac{||\\Delta \\mathbf{v}_{g, T}|| - ||\\Delta \\mathbf{v}_{g, T_v}||}{||\\Delta \\mathbf{v}_{g, T_v}||} = \\frac{||\\frac{1}{C} \\Delta \\mathbf{v}_{g, T_v}|| - ||\\Delta \\mathbf{v}_{g, T_v}||}{||\\Delta \\mathbf{v}_{g, T_v}||}\n$$\nSince $C  1$, $|1/C|=1/C$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\frac{1}{C}||\\Delta \\mathbf{v}_{g, T_v}|| - ||\\Delta \\mathbf{v}_{g, T_v}||}{||\\Delta \\mathbf{v}_{g, T_v}||} = \\frac{1}{C} - 1 = \\delta\n$$\nThus, the fractional error in the magnitude of the inferred geostrophic wind shear is identical to the fractional error in the hypsometric thickness, $\\delta$.\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are given $q = 0.015$ and $\\varepsilon = 0.622$.\nFirst, calculate the mixing ratio $r$:\n$$\nr = \\frac{q}{1-q} = \\frac{0.015}{1-0.015} = \\frac{0.015}{0.985} = \\frac{15}{985} = \\frac{3}{197}\n$$\nNow, calculate the fractional error $\\delta$:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{r(\\varepsilon-1)}{\\varepsilon+r} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{197}(0.622-1)}{0.622 + \\frac{3}{197}} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{197}(-0.378)}{0.622 + 0.0152284...}\n$$\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{-0.005756345...}{0.6372284...} = -0.00903343...\n$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures. The first significant figure is $9$, followed by $0$, $3$, and $3$.\n$$\n\\delta \\approx -0.009033\n$$\nThis single numerical value represents both the fractional error in thickness and the fractional error in the magnitude of the geostrophic wind shear.",
