With this condition, the governing equations simplify to:\n\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = -g' \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x} \\quad (4) $$\n$$ \\beta y u = -g' \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y} \\quad (5) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t} + H \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0 \\quad (6) $$\n\nWe seek wave-like solutions propagating zonally, of the form $f(x-ct, y)$. For such solutions, the partial derivatives are related by $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = -c \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$. Applying this to equations (4) and (6):\n\nFrom (4): $-c \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = -g' \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x} \\implies c u = g' h$ (assuming zero integration constant).\nFrom (6): $-c \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x} + H \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0 \\implies ch = H u$ (assuming zero integration constant and using $cu=g'h$ relation from (4) is not correct here, it should be $c h = \\frac{g'H}{c} h$).\n\nFor a non-trivial solution ($u, h \\neq 0$), we can combine the time-differentiated equations. Differentiating (6) with respect to $t$ and (4) with respect to $x$ gives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial t^2} + H \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x \\partial t} = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t \\partial x} = -g' \\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial x^2} $$\nSubstituting the second into the first yields the wave equation: $\\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial t^2} = g'H \\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial x^2}$.\nThe phase speed of the Kelvin wave, $c_K$, is therefore:\n$$ c_K = \\sqrt{g'H} $$\nThese waves propagate eastward ($c_K > 0$). Equation (5) determines their meridional structure. Substituting $u=(c_K/H)h$: $\\beta y (c_K/H)h = -g' \\partial h/\\partial y$. Using $c_K^2 = g'H$, this simplifies to $\\partial h/\\partial y = -(\\beta/c_K) y h$, which integrates to a Gaussian profile $h(y) \\propto \\exp(-\\beta y^2 / (2c_K))$, confirming the wave is trapped at the equator.

In this limit, for Rossby waves, we look for low-frequency solutions ($\\omega \\to 0$). The dispersion relation simplifies by neglecting the $\\omega^2$ term compared to the other terms:\n$$ - k^2 - \\frac{k\\beta}{\\omega} \\approx \\frac{\\beta}{c_K}(2n+1) $$\nFor long waves ($k \\to 0$), we can also neglect the $k^2$ term:\n$$ - \\frac{k\\beta}{\\omega} \\approx \\frac{\\beta}{c_K}(2n+1) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\omega}{k} \\approx -\\frac{\\beta c_K}{\\beta(2n+1)} $$\nThe phase speed $c = \\omega/k$ in the long-wave limit is therefore:\n$$ c_R(n) = -\\frac{c_K}{2n+1} $$\nThe first meridional-mode Rossby wave corresponds to $n=1$. Its phase speed, $c_{R1}$, is:\n$$ c_{R1} = -\\frac{c_K}{2(1)+1} = -\\frac{c_K}{3} $$\nThe negative sign indicates westward propagation.\n\n**Calculation of Transit Times and their Ratio**\n\nLet $T_K$ be the Kelvin wave transit time and $T_{R1}$ be the first Rossby wave transit time across a basin of length $L$.\nThe Kelvin wave travels with speed $c_K$. Its transit time is:\n$$ T_K = \\frac{L}{c_K} $$\nThe first Rossby wave travels with speed $|c_{R1}| = c_K/3$. Its transit time is:\n$$ T_{R1} = \\frac{L}{|c_{R1}|} = \\frac{L}{c_K/3} = 3 \\frac{L}{c_K} $$\nThe dimensionless ratio of the first Rossby wave transit time to the Kelvin wave transit time is:\n$$ \\frac{T_{R1}}{T_K} = \\frac{3 L/c_K}{L/c_K} = 3 $$\nThis result is a constant, independent of the specific values of $g'$, $H$, and $L$.\n\nFor completeness, the individual values are:\nKelvin wave speed:\n$$ c_K = \\sqrt{g'H} = \\sqrt{(0.03)(200)} = \\sqrt{6} \\approx 2.449\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}} $$\n\nKelvin wave transit time:\n$$ T_K = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^7\\ \\mathrm{m}}{\\sqrt{6}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}} \\approx 6.124 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{s} \\times \\frac{1\\ \\mathrm{day}}{86400\\ \\mathrm{s}} \\approx 70.88\\ \\mathrm{days} $$\n\nFirst Rossby wave speed (magnitude):\n$$ |c_{R1}| = \\frac{c_K}{3} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3} \\approx 0.8165\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}} $$\n\nFirst Rossby wave transit time:\n$$ T_{R1} = \\frac{L}{|c_{R1}|} = 3 T_K \\approx 3 \\times 70.88\\ \\mathrm{days} \\approx 212.6\\ \\mathrm{days} $$\n\nThe final answer required is the ratio of these transit times.

The atmospheric response to $T'$ modifies the trade winds, which drives $u'$ and $w'$; for the purposes of this problem, represent that coupled response by linear closures $u' = c_u\\,T'$ and $w' = c_w\\,T'$, where $c_u$ and $c_w$ are constant coupling coefficients determined by the large-scale Walker circulation and ocean dynamics in the equatorial Pacific. In the observed mean state, the cold tongue cools eastward so $T_x^{m} < 0$, and near the surface the ocean warms upward so $T_z^{m} > 0$. Under El Niño conditions, $T' > 0$ weakens the easterly trades, leading to $u' > 0$ (eastward anomalies) and $w' < 0$ (reduced upwelling), consistent with $c_u > 0$ and $c_w < 0$.\n\nStarting from the mixed-layer budget and these linear closures, derive an expression for the linear growth rate $\\sigma$ of $T'$ and use it to assess how mean state biases in $T_x^{m}$ alter the Bjerknes feedback loop.

Using the derived formula and the given mixed-layer depth $h$, the monthly temperature tendency, $\\partial_t T_m$, is computed for each month.\n3.  The month index $m^{\\ast}$ corresponding to the maximum value in the series of $\\partial_t T_m$ is identified. This is the month of peak warming tendency.\n4.  At month $m^{\\ast}$, the values of $Q_{net,m^{\\ast}}$, $Q_{adv,m^{\\ast}}$, and $Q_{ent,m^{\\ast}}$ are compared. The term with the largest positive value is identified as the dominant term, and its corresponding integer code $d$ is recorded.\n5.  The fractional contributions at the peak month are calculated by dividing each term's value by the total flux, $S_{m^{\\ast}}$ (e.g., $f_{net} = Q_{net,m^{\\ast}}/S_{m^{\\ast}}$).\n6.  The final results—$m^{\\ast}$, $d$, the peak tendency $\\partial_t T_{m^{\\ast}}$, and the fractional contributions $f_{net}$, $f_{adv}$, $f_{ent}$—are compiled and rounded to the specified precision. This process is repeated for all three parameter sets to generate the final output.",
