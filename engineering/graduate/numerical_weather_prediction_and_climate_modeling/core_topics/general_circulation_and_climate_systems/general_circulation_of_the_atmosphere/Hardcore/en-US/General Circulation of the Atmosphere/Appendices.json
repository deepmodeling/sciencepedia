It is scientifically grounded in the principles of geophysical fluid dynamics, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and stated using objective, formal language. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the identification and evaluation of two nondimensional parameters derived from the governing equations for a rotating, stably stratified Boussinesq fluid. The governing equations, neglecting dissipation, are the momentum equations, the buoyancy equation, and the continuity equation.\n\nLet the velocity vector be $\\vec{u} = (u, v, w)$, the pressure perturbation be $p'$, the buoyancy be $b$, and the constant reference density be $\\rho_0$. The equations are:\nHorizontal momentum:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + w \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} - fv = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial x} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} + w \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial z} + fu = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial y} $$\nVertical momentum:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y} + w \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} = b - \\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial z} $$\nBuoyancy:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial y} + w \\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial z} = N^2 w $$\nContinuity (incompressibility for Boussinesq fluid):\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} = 0 $$\n\nWe are given the following characteristic scales:\nHorizontal velocity: $U$\nHorizontal length: $L$\nVertical depth: $H$\nCoriolis parameter: $f$\nBrunt-Väisälä frequency: $N$\n\nFrom these, we can deduce scales for other variables. The continuity equation relates the scales of the velocity components. If we let the characteristic scales of $(u, v, w)$ be $(U, U, W)$ and of $(x, y, z)$ be $(L, L, H)$, then to ensure all terms in the continuity equation can be of the same order of magnitude, we must have:\n$$ \\frac{U}{L} \\sim \\frac{W}{H} \\implies W = U \\frac{H}{L} $$\nThe characteristic timescale for advection is $T = \\frac{L}{U}$.\n\n(i) Ratio of horizontal advective inertia to Coriolis acceleration\n\nThe horizontal momentum equation (e.g., for the $u$-component) contains the horizontal advective inertia terms, such as $u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$, and the Coriolis acceleration term, $-fv$. We compare the characteristic magnitudes of these terms.\nThe scale of the horizontal advective term is:\n$$ [u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}] \\sim U \\frac{U}{L} = \\frac{U^2}{L} $$\nThe scale of the Coriolis term is:\n$$ [fv] \\sim fU $$\nThe ratio of horizontal advective inertia to the Coriolis acceleration is the Rossby number, denoted $Ro$.\n$$ Ro = \\frac{\\text{Horizontal Advective Inertia}}{\\text{Coriolis Acceleration}} = \\frac{U^2/L}{fU} = \\frac{U}{fL} $$\nThis parameter measures the importance of advective acceleration relative to the Coriolis force. For synoptic-scale midlatitude systems, $Ro \\ll 1$, indicating that the flow is approximately in geostrophic balance.\n\n(ii) Ratio of vertical advective dynamics to stratification-restoring effects\n\nThis ratio is a form of the Froude number, $Fr$, for a stratified fluid. It compares the kinetic energy of the flow to the potential energy required to move fluid vertically against the stable stratification.\nThe characteristic kinetic energy per unit mass of the horizontal flow is:\n$$ \\text{KE} \\sim U^2 $$\nThe \"stratification-restoring effect\" can be quantified by the amount of potential energy required to lift a fluid parcel against the buoyancy force over the characteristic vertical scale $H$. The work done per unit mass against the buoyancy force $b$ to displace a parcel vertically by a distance $z'$ is $\\int b \\, dz'$. The buoyancy of a parcel displaced from its equilibrium is approximately $b \\approx N^2 z'$. The potential energy for a characteristic displacement $H$ is thus:\n$$ \\text{PE} \\sim \\int_0^H N^2 z' \\, dz' \\sim N^2 H^2 $$\nThe problem asks for a comparison of \"vertical advective dynamics\" (which we interpret as the kinetic energy available to drive vertical motion) to the \"stratification-restoring effects\" (the potential energy barrier of the stratification). The square of the Froude number is the ratio of these energies:\n$$ Fr^2 = \\frac{\\text{KE}}{\\text{PE}} = \\frac{U^2}{N^2 H^2} $$\nTaking the square root gives the nondimensional parameter that is linear in velocity, which is the conventional definition of the Froude number in this context:\n$$ Fr = \\frac{U}{NH} $$\nThis parameter compares the flow speed $U$ to the speed of long internal gravity waves, $c_{iw} \\sim NH$.

The flow is assumed to be horizontally non-divergent in the Quasi-Geostrophic (QG) sense and linearized about a state of rest. The upper layer has thickness $H_1$ and the lower layer has thickness $H_2$. Stratification between the layers is represented by a reduced gravity $g'$ that arises from the density contrast between the layers, and the true gravitational acceleration is $g$.

No units are required for this ratio, and no rounding is needed.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It describes a standard physical system in dynamic meteorology and asks for a standard derivation. The problem is valid.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the long-wave Rossby-wave phase speeds for the external (barotropic) and first internal (baroclinic) modes of a two-layer, QG atmosphere, and for the ratio of their magnitudes.\n\nThe starting point is the conservation of quasi-geostrophic (QG) potential vorticity (PV) for the normal modes of the system. In a two-layer shallow water system, there are two normal modes: a barotropic mode, which represents vertically uniform motion, and a baroclinic mode, which represents vertical shear. These modes are associated with two distinct Rossby radii of deformation.\nThe external (barotropic) Rossby radius of deformation, $R_e$, is associated with disturbances of the free surface and depends on the total fluid depth $H=H_1+H_2$ and the true gravitational acceleration $g$:\n$$ R_e = \\frac{\\sqrt{g(H_1+H_2)}}{f_0} $$\nThe first internal (baroclinic) Rossby radius of deformation, $R_i$, is associated with disturbances of the interface between the two layers and depends on the layer depths $H_1, H_2$ and the reduced gravity $g'$:\n$$ R_i = \\frac{\\sqrt{g' \\frac{H_1 H_2}{H_1+H_2}}}{f_0} $$\nThe problem states \"horizontally non-divergent in the Quasi-Geostrophic (QG) sense\". A standard rigid-lid QG model would have an infinite external radius of deformation and thus produce an unphysical, infinite long-wave phase speed for the barotropic mode. The explicit mention of deformation radii for the \"two-layer shallow-water system\" implies that we should consider the Rossby wave dynamics in a system that supports a finite external radius, i.e., a model with a free-surface. The QG approximation in this context refers to the low-frequency limit of the shallow-water equations.\n\nIn this framework, the QG PV conservation for each normal mode can be written in an \"equivalent-barotropic\" form. Let $\\psi_{BT}$ be the streamfunction for the barotropic mode and $\\psi_{BC}$ be the streamfunction for the baroclinic mode. For a flow linearized about a state of rest on a beta-plane, the PV conservation equations for the two modes are:\n1. External (Barotropic) Mode:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left(\\nabla^2 \\psi_{BT} - \\frac{1}{R_e^2} \\psi_{BT} \\right) + \\beta \\frac{\\partial \\psi_{BT}}{\\partial x} = 0 $$\n2.

The assumption for the long-wave limit is that the horizontal scale of the wave, $L = 2\\pi/K$, is much larger than any relevant intrinsic length scale in the system. Mathematically, this corresponds to the limit $K^2 \\to 0$.\n\nApplying this limit to the phase speed expressions:\nThe long-wave barotropic phase speed, $c_{lw, BT}$, is:\n$$ c_{lw, BT} = \\lim_{K^2 \\to 0} c_{BT} = - \\frac{\\beta}{R_e^{-2}} = -\\beta R_e^2 $$\nThe long-wave baroclinic phase speed, $c_{lw, BC}$, is:\n$$ c_{lw, BC} = \\lim_{K^2 \\to 0} c_{BC} = - \\frac{\\beta}{R_i^{-2}} = -\\beta R_i^2 $$\n\nNext, we are asked to find the ratio of the magnitudes of the baroclinic to barotropic long-wave phase speeds.\nThe magnitudes are:\n$|c_{lw, BT}| = \\beta R_e^2$\n$|c_{lw, BC}| = \\beta R_i^2$\nThe ratio is:\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{|c_{lw, BC}|}{|c_{lw, BT}|} = \\frac{\\beta R_i^2}{\\beta R_e^2} = \\frac{R_i^2}{R_e^2} $$\nNow, we substitute the definitions of $R_i^2$ and $R_e^2$:\n$$ R_e^2 = \\frac{g(H_1+H_2)}{f_0^2} $$\n$$ R_i^2 = \\frac{g' H_1 H_2}{f_0^2(H_1+H_2)} $$\nThe ratio becomes:\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\frac{g' H_1 H_2}{f_0^2(H_1+H_2)}}{\\frac{g(H_1+H_2)}{f_0^2}} = \\frac{g' H_1 H_2}{f_0^2(H_1+H_2)} \\cdot \\frac{f_0^2}{g(H_1+H_2)} $$\nSimplifying the expression, we obtain the final closed-form analytic expression for the ratio:\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{g' H_1 H_2}{g(H_1+H_2)^2} $$\n\nFinally, we explain the physical significance of this ratio. In the Earth's atmosphere, the reduced gravity $g'$ is typically much smaller than the true gravity $g$ (i.e., $g'/g \\ll 1$). Consequently, the ratio is a small number. For example, if we consider $H_1 \\approx H_2$, the ratio is approximately $g'/(4g)$, which is on the order of $10^{-2}$. This indicates that the intrinsic westward propagation speed of long baroclinic Rossby waves is much smaller than that of long barotropic Rossby waves ($|c_{lw, BC}| \\ll |c_{lw, BT}|$).\nSynoptic-scale eddies (i.e., mid-latitude weather systems like cyclones and anticyclones) are fundamentally baroclinic phenomena. Their propagation is a combination of advection by the mean zonal wind and their intrinsic Rossby-wave phase speed. The small magnitude of the baroclinic phase speed ($|c_{lw, BC}| = \\beta R_i^2$) is crucial. Its value is typically a few meters per second, which is of the same order as, but often smaller than, the speed of the mean westerly jet stream.\nThis has two major implications:\n1.  The overall motion of synoptic-scale eddies is typically eastward, as they are advected by the stronger mean westerlies, but their eastward speed is less than the mean wind speed due to their intrinsic westward propagation.\n2.  The baroclinic wave speed is slow enough that for certain wavelengths, it can be cancelled by the eastward mean flow ($\\bar{U} + c_{BC} = 0$), leading to quasi-stationary Rossby waves. These stationary waves are responsible for persistent weather patterns and blocking events. The barotropic wave speed, by contrast, is much too fast to be made stationary by typical atmospheric flows.\nThus, the smallness of the ratio is fundamental to explaining the observed behavior and structure of synoptic-scale atmospheric phenomena.",

Substituting this in:\n    $$\n    -\\overline{v'\\theta'} \\frac{\\partial \\overline{\\theta}}{\\partial y} = \\overline{w'\\theta'} \\left( \\frac{N^2 \\theta_0}{g} \\right)\n    $$\n    Now, we can solve for the vertical eddy heat flux $\\overline{w'\\theta'}$:\n    $$\n    \\overline{w'\\theta'} = -\\frac{g}{N^2 \\theta_0} \\overline{v'\\theta'} \\frac{\\partial \\overline{\\theta}}{\\partial y}\n    $$\n\n4.  **Calculating the Ratio**\n\n    Substitute this expression for $\\overline{w'\\theta'}$ back into the formula for $c(\\mathrm{APE}_e \\to \\mathrm{KE}_e)$:\n    $$\n    c(\\mathrm{APE}_e \\to \\mathrm{KE}_e) = \\rho_0 \\frac{g}{\\theta_0} \\left( -\\frac{g}{N^2 \\theta_0} \\overline{v'\\theta'} \\frac{\\partial \\overline{\\theta}}{\\partial y} \\right) = -\\rho_0 \\frac{g^2}{N^2 \\theta_0^2} \\overline{v'\\theta'} \\frac{\\partial \\overline{\\theta}}{\\partial y}\n    $$\n    We see that this expression is identical to the one for $c(\\mathrm{APE}_m \\to \\mathrm{APE}_e)$.\n    $$\n    c(\\mathrm{APE}_m \\to \\mathrm{APE}_e) = c(\\mathrm{APE}_e \\to \\mathrm{KE}_e)\n    $$\n    This equality is a fundamental result of QG theory for developing baroclinic eddies in a statistically steady state: the rate at which eddy APE is generated from the mean state is perfectly balanced by the rate at which it is converted to eddy kinetic energy.\n\n    Therefore, the ratio $R$ is:\n    $$\n    R = \\frac{c(\\mathrm{APE}_m \\to \\mathrm{APE}_e)}{c(\\mathrm{APE}_e \\to \\mathrm{KE}_e)} = 1\n    $$\n    The extensive numerical data provided is internally consistent (as shown by the thermal wind relation: $f_0 \\partial_z \\overline{u} \\approx -g/\\theta_0 \\partial_y \\overline{\\theta}$) and physically plausible, but it is not needed to calculate the ratio, which is analytically 1 under the stated QG assumptions.\n\n    Reporting the result to four significant figures as requested gives $1.000$.",
