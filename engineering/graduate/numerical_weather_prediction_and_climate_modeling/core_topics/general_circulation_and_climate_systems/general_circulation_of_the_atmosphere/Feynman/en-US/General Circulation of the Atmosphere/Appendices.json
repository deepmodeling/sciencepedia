A key skill in geophysical fluid dynamics is identifying the dominant force balances that apply at different scales. This practice introduces two fundamental non-dimensional parameters, the Rossby number ($Ro$) and the Froude number ($Fr$), which allow us to quantitatively assess the validity of the geostrophic and hydrostatic approximations for large-scale flows.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of geophysical fluid dynamics, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and stated using objective, formal language. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the identification and evaluation of two nondimensional parameters derived from the governing equations for a rotating, stably stratified Boussinesq fluid. The governing equations, neglecting dissipation, are the momentum equations, the buoyancy equation, and the continuity equation.\n\nLet the velocity vector be $\\vec{u} = (u, v, w)$, the pressure perturbation be $p'$, the buoyancy be $b$, and the constant reference density be $\\rho_0$. The equations are:\nHorizontal momentum:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + w \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} - fv = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial x} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} + w \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial z} + fu = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial y} $$\nVertical momentum:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y} + w \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} = b - \\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial z} $$\nBuoyancy:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial y} + w \\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial z} = N^2 w $$\nContinuity (incompressibility for Boussinesq fluid):\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} = 0 $$\n\nWe are given the following characteristic scales:\nHorizontal velocity: $U$\nHorizontal length: $L$\nVertical depth: $H$\nCoriolis parameter: $f$\nBrunt-Väisälä frequency: $N$\n\nFrom these, we can deduce scales for other variables. The continuity equation relates the scales of the velocity components. If we let the characteristic scales of $(u, v, w)$ be $(U, U, W)$ and of $(x, y, z)$ be $(L, L, H)$, then to ensure all terms in the continuity equation can be of the same order of magnitude, we must have:\n$$ \\frac{U}{L} \\sim \\frac{W}{H} \\implies W = U \\frac{H}{L} $$\nThe characteristic timescale for advection is $T = \\frac{L}{U}$.\n\n(i) Ratio of horizontal advective inertia to Coriolis acceleration\n\nThe horizontal momentum equation (e.g., for the $u$-component) contains the horizontal advective inertia terms, such as $u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$, and the Coriolis acceleration term, $-fv$. We compare the characteristic magnitudes of these terms.\nThe scale of the horizontal advective term is:\n$$ [u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}] \\sim U \\frac{U}{L} = \\frac{U^2}{L} $$\nThe scale of the Coriolis term is:\n$$ [fv] \\sim fU $$\nThe ratio of horizontal advective inertia to the Coriolis acceleration is the Rossby number, denoted $Ro$.\n$$ Ro = \\frac{\\text{Horizontal Advective Inertia}}{\\text{Coriolis Acceleration}} = \\frac{U^2/L}{fU} = \\frac{U}{fL} $$\nThis parameter measures the importance of advective acceleration relative to the Coriolis force. For synoptic-scale midlatitude systems, $Ro \\ll 1$, indicating that the flow is approximately in geostrophic balance.\n\n(ii) Ratio of vertical advective dynamics to stratification-restoring effects\n\nThis ratio is a form of the Froude number, $Fr$, for a stratified fluid. It compares the kinetic energy of the flow to the potential energy required to move fluid vertically against the stable stratification.\nThe characteristic kinetic energy per unit mass of the horizontal flow is:\n$$ \\text{KE} \\sim U^2 $$\nThe \"stratification-restoring effect\" can be quantified by the amount of potential energy required to lift a fluid parcel against the buoyancy force over the characteristic vertical scale $H$. The work done per unit mass against the buoyancy force $b$ to displace a parcel vertically by a distance $z'$ is $\\int b \\, dz'$. The buoyancy of a parcel displaced from its equilibrium is approximately $b \\approx N^2 z'$. The potential energy for a characteristic displacement $H$ is thus:\n$$ \\text{PE} \\sim \\int_0^H N^2 z' \\, dz' \\sim N^2 H^2 $$\nThe problem asks for a comparison of \"vertical advective dynamics\" (which we interpret as the kinetic energy available to drive vertical motion) to the \"stratification-restoring effects\" (the potential energy barrier of the stratification). The square of the Froude number is the ratio of these energies:\n$$ Fr^2 = \\frac{\\text{KE}}{\\text{PE}} = \\frac{U^2}{N^2 H^2} $$\nTaking the square root gives the nondimensional parameter that is linear in velocity, which is the conventional definition of the Froude number in this context:\n$$ Fr = \\frac{U}{NH} $$\nThis parameter compares the flow speed $U$ to the speed of long internal gravity waves, $c_{iw} \\sim NH$.

For a synoptic-scale disturbance, we can perform a scale analysis to relate the characteristic scales of these terms. Let $U$ be the characteristic horizontal wind speed, $L$ be the characteristic horizontal length scale, $W$ be the characteristic vertical velocity, and $H$ be the characteristic vertical length scale (the depth of the troposphere).\n\nThe partial derivatives can be scaled as follows:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\sim \\frac{U}{L} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} \\sim \\frac{U}{L} \\quad (\\text{assuming a characteristic velocity scale } V \\sim U) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} \\sim \\frac{W}{H} $$\nFor the continuity equation to hold, the terms must balance.

This approximation implies that the horizontal gradients of buoyancy are negligible compared to the background vertical gradient.\n\nSubstituting this into the PV definition, we get:\n$$\nq \\approx (\\boldsymbol{\\omega} + f\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}) \\cdot (N^{2}\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}})\n$$\nLet $\\zeta = \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\omega}$ be the vertical component of the relative vorticity. The dot product yields:\n$$\nq \\approx (f + \\zeta)N^{2}\n$$\nThis expression represents the total PV. A PV anomaly, which we denote $q_{b}$ (to specify it's the buoyancy-form anomaly), is the deviation from a background state. Assuming the background state is at rest ($\\zeta_{bg} = 0$), the background PV is $q_{bg} = fN^{2}$. The PV anomaly is then given by:\n$$\nq_{b} = q - q_{bg} \\approx (f + \\zeta)N^{2} - fN^{2} = \\zeta N^{2}\n$$\nThe flow is geostrophically balanced, so the relative vorticity $\\zeta$ is the geostrophic vorticity, $\\zeta_{g}$. Thus, we have the relation:\n$$\nq_{b} \\approx \\zeta_{g} N^{2}\n$$\nThe next step is to relate the geostrophic vorticity $\\zeta_{g}$ to the magnitude of the geostrophic wind perturbation, $u^{\\prime}$. Geostrophic vorticity is defined as $\\zeta_g = \\frac{\\partial v_g}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial u_g}{\\partial y}$. Through scaling analysis, the magnitude of the derivatives of the wind field over a horizontal length scale $L$ can be related to the characteristic wind speed $u^{\\prime}$. The scaling for vorticity is therefore:\n$$\n\\zeta_{g} \\sim \\frac{u^{\\prime}}{L}\n$$\nSubstituting this scaling for $\\zeta_{g}$ into our PV anomaly expression:\n$$\nq_{b} \\sim \\left(\\frac{u^{\\prime}}{L}\\right) N^{2}\n$$\nSolving this for the wind perturbation magnitude $u^{\\prime}$ gives the desired leading-order scaling relation:\n$$\nu^{\\prime} \\sim \\frac{q_{b} L}{N^{2}}\n$$\n\n### Part 2: Conversion of PV Anomaly Units\n\nThe problem provides the PV anomaly magnitude in the \"potential temperature form\", $q_{\\theta} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}\\,K\\,m^{-1}}$.

Taking the gradient of this expression, we find the relationship between the perturbation gradients:\n$$\n\\nabla b^{\\prime} = \\frac{g}{\\theta_{0}} \\nabla \\theta^{\\prime}\n$$\nThe PV anomaly arises from the perturbation fields. Under the same approximations as in Part 1 (where vertical gradients dominate), the relationship between the anomalies is:\n$$\nq_{b} = \\boldsymbol{\\omega}_{a} \\cdot \\nabla b^{\\prime} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad q_{\\theta} = \\boldsymbol{\\omega}_{a} \\cdot \\nabla \\theta^{\\prime}\n$$\nTherefore, the two forms of the PV anomaly are related by:\n$$\nq_{b} = \\frac{g}{\\theta_{0}} q_{\\theta}\n$$\n\n### Part 3: Numerical Evaluation\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- PV anomaly in potential temperature form: $q_{\\theta} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}\\,K\\,m^{-1}}$\n- Horizontal length scale: $L = 500\\,\\mathrm{km} = 5 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- Brunt–Väisälä frequency: $N = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n- Gravitational acceleration: $g = 9.81\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}$\n- Reference potential temperature: $\\theta_{0} = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the magnitude of the PV anomaly in buoyancy form, $q_{b}$:\n$$\nq_{b} = \\frac{g}{\\theta_{0}} q_{\\theta} = \\frac{9.81\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}}{300\\,\\mathrm{K}} \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}\\,K\\,m^{-1}}) = 0.0327\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}\\,K^{-1}} \\times 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}\\,K\\,m^{-1}}\n$$\n$$\nq_{b} = 3.27 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-3}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this value and the other given parameters into our scaling relation for $u^{\\prime}$:\n$$\nu^{\\prime} \\sim \\frac{q_{b} L}{N^{2}} = \\frac{(3.27 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-3}})(5 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{m})}{(0.01\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}})^{2}}\n$$\n$$\nu^{\\prime} \\sim \\frac{1.635 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-3}}}{1 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-2}}} = 1.635 \\times 10^{2}\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}} = 163.5\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nu^{\\prime} \\approx 164\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}\n$$",
