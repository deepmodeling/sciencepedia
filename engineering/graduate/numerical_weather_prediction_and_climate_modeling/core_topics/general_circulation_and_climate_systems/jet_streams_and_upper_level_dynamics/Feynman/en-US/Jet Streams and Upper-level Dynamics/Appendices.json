            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the necessary condition for barotropic instability within the Quasi-Geostrophic (QG) framework and its application to a specific zonal jet profile to find a critical jet amplitude.\n\nFirst, we establish the necessary condition for barotropic instability, known as the Rayleigh-Kuo criterion. The governing equation for barotropic QG dynamics is the conservation of QG potential vorticity (PV), $q$, following the geostrophic flow:\n$$\n\\frac{Dq}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial t} + u_g \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial x} + v_g \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial y} = 0\n$$\nThe QG potential vorticity is defined as $q = \\nabla^2 \\psi + f$, where $\\psi$ is the geostrophic streamfunction and $f$ is the Coriolis parameter. On a beta-plane, $f = f_0 + \\beta y$, where $f_0$ and $\\beta$ are constants.\n\nWe consider a basic state consisting of a purely zonal flow $U(y)$ that is in geostrophic balance with a streamfunction $\\Psi(y)$, such that $U(y) = -\\frac{d\\Psi}{dy}$. The background PV, $Q(y)$, is then:\n$$\nQ(y) = \\nabla^2 \\Psi(y) + f = \\frac{d^2\\Psi}{dy^2} + f_0 + \\beta y\n$$\nUsing the geostrophic relation, we can express the second derivative of the streamfunction in terms of the zonal flow: $\\frac{d^2\\Psi}{dy^2} = -\\frac{dU}{dy}$. Substituting this into the expression for $Q(y)$ gives:\n$$\nQ(y) = -\\frac{dU}{dy} + f_0 + \\beta y\n$$\nThe stability of this basic state is determined by the meridional gradient of the background PV, $\\frac{dQ}{dy}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dQ}{dy} = \\frac{d}{dy}\\left(-\\frac{dU}{dy} + f_0 + \\beta y\\right) = \\beta - \\frac{d^2U}{dy^2}\n$$\nThe Rayleigh-Kuo theorem states that a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for barotropic instability of the zonal flow $U(y)$ is that the meridional gradient of the background potential vorticity, $\\frac{dQ}{dy}$, must change sign somewhere in the domain. Since for a jet confined in the meridional direction, $U$ and its derivatives must vanish as $|y| \\to \\infty$, we have $\\frac{dQ}{dy} \\to \\beta$ as $|y| \\to \\infty$. Given $\\beta > 0$, for $\\frac{dQ}{dy}$ to change sign, it must become negative for at least one value of $y$.

This implies that the background flow can support the exponential growth of Rossby wave perturbations.

            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the eddy-induced zonal wind acceleration, $A(\\phi,p)$, from given atmospheric data. The solution proceeds in several steps based on the Transformed Eulerian Mean (TEM) framework.\n\n1.  **Calculate Preliminary Fields**: Convert latitudes to radians. Compute the Coriolis parameter $f = 2\\Omega\\sin\\phi$ and $\\cos\\phi$ for each latitude.\n2.  **Compute Static Stability**: At each latitude, calculate the vertical gradient of potential temperature, $\\frac{\\partial \\overline{\\theta}}{\\partial p}$, using finite differences on the pressure grid. A statically stable atmosphere will have a negative value for this quantity.\n3.  **Compute EP Flux Components**: Using the computed fields and input data, calculate the latitudinal ($F_\\phi$) and vertical ($F_p$) components of the EP flux at each grid point using their definitions:\n    $$F_{\\phi} = a \\cos\\phi \\left( - \\overline{u'v'} \\right)$$\n    $$F_{p} = a \\cos\\phi \\left( \\frac{ f \\, \\overline{v'\\theta'} }{ \\partial \\overline{\\theta} / \\partial p } \\right)$$\n4.  **Compute EP Flux Divergence Terms**: Calculate the two terms needed for the divergence using finite differences:\n    -   The latitudinal term requires the derivative $\\frac{\\partial (F_\\phi \\cos\\phi)}{\\partial\\phi}$.\n    -   The vertical term requires the derivative $\\frac{\\partial F_p}{\\partial p}$.\n5.  **Calculate Acceleration**: Combine the terms using the physically correct formula for acceleration, $A(\\phi,p) = \\frac{1}{a^2 \\cos^2\\phi} \\frac{\\partial (F_\\phi \\cos\\phi)}{\\partial\\phi} + \\frac{1}{a \\cos\\phi} \\frac{\\partial F_p}{\\partial p}$. The result is converted from m/s² to m/s/day by multiplying by 86400.\n6.  **Extract Final Metrics**: From the grid of $A(\\phi,p)$ values, compute the three required quantities for each test case: the latitude of maximum vertically-averaged acceleration ($\\phi^\\star$), the overall maximum positive acceleration, and the fraction of grid points with positive acceleration.",
