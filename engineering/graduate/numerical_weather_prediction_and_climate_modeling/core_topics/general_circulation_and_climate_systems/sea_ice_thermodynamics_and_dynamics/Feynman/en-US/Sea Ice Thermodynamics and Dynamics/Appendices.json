            "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional, vertically oriented snow–sea-ice column in a quiescent atmosphere and ocean, appropriate for a thermodynamic-only column model used in numerical weather prediction and climate modeling. Let the vertical coordinate $z$ increase upward, with $z=0$ at the ice–ocean interface, $0 \\le z \\le H_{i}$ occupied by sea ice of thickness $H_{i}$, and $H_{i} \\le z \\le H_{i}+H_{s}$ occupied by a snow layer of thickness $H_{s}$. Assume constant thermal conductivities $k_{i}$ for the ice and $k_{s}$ for the snow, no internal heat sources or sinks within the layers, and steady state (no temporal change of temperature).\n\nAt the top snow surface $z=H_{i}+H_{s}$, the net upward surface heat flux into the atmosphere is a prescribed constant $Q_{s}$ (with upward flux defined as positive). At the bottom ice–ocean interface $z=0$, the ocean provides a prescribed constant upward basal heat flux $Q_{o}$ into the ice. Assume that the ice–ocean interface temperature is fixed at the (salinity-dependent) seawater freezing temperature $T_{f}$ and that there is no interfacial phase change (no melting or freezing rate), so the conductive heat flux is continuous across the entire column.\n\nStarting from (i) energy conservation in each layer under steady state and (ii) Fourier’s law of heat conduction, derive the vertically linear temperature profile in each layer and enforce continuity of temperature and heat flux at the snow–ice interface. Determine the explicit analytic expression for the snow surface temperature $T_{s} \\equiv T(H_{i}+H_{s})$ in terms of $T_{f}$, $H_{i}$, $H_{s}$, $k_{i}$, $k_{s}$, $Q_{s}$, and $Q_{o}$, along with any necessary consistency condition implied by the steady state and the stated assumptions.\n\nExpress the final temperature in kelvins. No numerical evaluation is required; provide the exact symbolic expression. The final answer must be a single closed-form analytic expression.",
            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. It describes a standard one-dimensional, steady-state heat conduction problem through a two-layer composite slab, which is a fundamental model in thermodynamics and its applications in geophysics.\n\nThe solution proceeds by applying the principles of energy conservation and Fourier's law of heat conduction.\n\nFirst, we consider the governing equation for heat transfer. In a one-dimensional system under steady-state conditions with no internal heat sources or sinks, the energy conservation principle simplifies to the statement that the heat flux, $Q$, must be constant with respect to the spatial coordinate $z$. The problem specifies a prescribed upward heat flux $Q_{o}$ at the bottom boundary ($z=0$) and a prescribed upward heat flux $Q_{s}$ at the top boundary ($z=H_{i}+H_{s}$). For a physically consistent steady state to exist, the heat flux must be uniform throughout the entire column. This imposes a necessary consistency condition:\n$$Q_{s} = Q_{o}$$\nLet us denote this constant upward heat flux by $Q$. Thus, $Q = Q_s = Q_o$.\n\nThe relationship between the heat flux $Q$ and the temperature gradient $\\frac{dT}{dz}$ is given by Fourier's law of heat conduction. With the upward direction defined as positive for both $z$ and $Q$, the law is:\n$$Q = -k \\frac{dT}{dz}$$\nwhere $k$ is the thermal conductivity. This equation holds separately in the ice and snow layers, with their respective conductivities $k_i$ and $k_s$.\n\nSince $k$ is constant within each layer, the governing equation $\\frac{d}{dz}(-k \\frac{dT}{dz}) = \\frac{dQ}{dz} = 0$ simplifies to $\\frac{d^2T}{dz^2} = 0$ in each layer. The general solution is a linear temperature profile in both the ice and snow.\n\nFor the ice layer, where $0 \\le z \\le H_{i}$:\n$$T_{i}(z) = A_{i}z + B_{i}$$\nFor the snow layer, where $H_{i} \\le z \\le H_{i}+H_{s}$:\n$$T_{s}(z) = A_{s}z + B_{s}$$\n\nWe determine the constants $A_i$, $B_i$, $A_s$, and $B_s$ using the boundary and interface conditions.\n\n1.  **Bottom boundary condition at $z=0$**: The temperature is fixed at the seawater freezing point, $T(0) = T_{f}$.\n    Applying this to the ice profile:\n    $$T_{i}(0) = A_{i}(0) + B_{i} = T_{f} \\implies B_{i} = T_{f}$$\n    The ice temperature profile becomes $T_{i}(z) = A_{i}z + T_{f}$.\n\n2.  **Flux condition**: The constant heat flux $Q$ is related to the temperature gradient.\n    In the ice layer:\n    $$Q = -k_{i} \\frac{dT_{i}}{dz} = -k_{i} A_{i} \\implies A_{i} = -\\frac{Q}{k_{i}}$$\n    So, the temperature profile in the ice layer is explicitly determined as:\n    $$T_{i}(z) = T_{f} - \\frac{Q}{k_{i}}z$$\n    In the snow layer:\n    $$Q = -k_{s} \\frac{dT_{s}}{dz} = -k_{s} A_{s} \\implies A_{s} = -\\frac{Q}{k_{s}}$$\n    The snow temperature profile is $T_{s}(z) = -\\frac{Q}{k_{s}}z + B_{s}$.\n\n3.  **Interface condition at $z=H_{i}$**: Temperature must be continuous at the interface between snow and ice, i.e., $T_{i}(H_{i}) = T_{s}(H_{i})$.\n    $$T_f - \\frac{Q}{k_i}H_i = -\\frac{Q}{k_s}H_i + B_s$$\n    We can solve for the constant $B_s$:\n    $$B_{s} = T_{f} - \\frac{Q}{k_{i}}H_{i} + \\frac{Q}{k_{s}}H_{i} = T_{f} + Q\\left(\\frac{H_{i}}{k_{s}} - \\frac{H_{i}}{k_{i}}\\right)$$\n\nThis fully determines the temperature profile in the snow layer:\n$$T_{s}(z) = -\\frac{Q}{k_{s}}z + T_{f} + Q\\left(\\frac{H_{i}}{k_{s}} - \\frac{H_{i}}{k_{i}}\\right)$$\n\nFinally, we determine the snow surface temperature, $T_{s} \\equiv T(H_{i}+H_{s})$, by evaluating the snow temperature profile at the top surface $z = H_{i}+H_{s}$:\n$$T_{s} = T_{s}(H_{i}+H_{s}) = -\\frac{Q}{k_{s}}(H_{i}+H_{s}) + T_{f} + Q\\left(\\frac{H_{i}}{k_{s}} - \\frac{H_{i}}{k_{i}}\\right)$$\n\nLet us simplify this expression:\n$$T_{s} = T_{f} - \\frac{Q H_{i}}{k_{s}} - \\frac{Q H_{s}}{k_{s}} + \\frac{Q H_{i}}{k_{s}} - \\frac{Q H_{i}}{k_{i}}$$\n$$T_{s} = T_{f} - \\frac{Q H_{s}}{k_{s}} - \\frac{Q H_{i}}{k_{i}}$$\n\nFactoring out the constant flux $Q$:\n$$T_{s} = T_{f} - Q\\left(\\frac{H_{i}}{k_{i}} + \\frac{H_{s}}{k_{s}}\\right)$$\n\nThe problem requests the expression in terms of the original given fluxes. Using the consistency condition $Q = Q_{s} = Q_{o}$, we can write the final expression using either $Q_{s}$ or $Q_{o}$. We choose $Q_{s}$ as it pertains to the surface.\n\nThe consistency condition is $Q_{s} = Q_{o}$.\nThe explicit analytic expression for the snow surface temperature is:\n$$T_{s} = T_{f} - Q_{s}\\left(\\frac{H_{i}}{k_{i}} + \\frac{H_{s}}{k_{s}}\\right)$$\nThis result is physically intuitive. The term $(\\frac{H_{i}}{k_{i}} + \\frac{H_{s}}{k_{s}})$ represents the total thermal resistance of the composite ice-snow slab. The total temperature drop across the slab, $T_{f} - T_{s}$, is equal to the heat flux $Q_{s}$ multiplied by this total thermal resistance. The expression provides the temperature in kelvins, given that $T_{f}$ is in kelvins.",

Per the problem statement, this balance is expressed per unit mass, meaning we sum the accelerations acting on the ice, which must equal zero for a steady state ($\\frac{d\\mathbf{u}}{dt}=0$).\n\nThe accelerations are:\n$1$. Coriolis acceleration: $\\mathbf{a}_{c} = -f \\hat{\\mathbf{k}} \\times \\mathbf{u}$, where $f$ is the Coriolis parameter, $\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}$ is the upward unit vector, and $\\mathbf{u}=(u,v)$ is the ice velocity.\n$2$. Air drag acceleration: The problem states to interpret $\\rho_{a} C_{a}$ as an effective coupling coefficient giving an acceleration proportional to the relative velocity. Thus, the air drag acceleration is $\\mathbf{a}_{a} = K_{a}(\\mathbf{U}_{a} - \\mathbf{u})$, where we define $K_{a} = \\rho_{a} C_{a}$.\n$3$. Ocean drag acceleration: Similarly, the ocean drag acceleration is $\\mathbf{a}_{o} = K_{o}(\\mathbf{U}_{o} - \\mathbf{u})$, where $K_{o} = \\rho_{w} C_{o}$.\n\nThe steady-state momentum balance equation is $\\mathbf{a}_{c} + \\mathbf{a}_{a} + \\mathbf{a}_{o} = \\mathbf{0}$.\nSubstituting the expressions for the accelerations:\n$$ -f \\hat{\\mathbf{k}} \\times \\mathbf{u} + K_{a}(\\mathbf{U}_{a} - \\mathbf{u}) + K_{o}(\\mathbf{U}_{o} - \\mathbf{u}) = \\mathbf{0} $$\nWe express this vector equation in its components. In a 2D horizontal plane with basis vectors $(\\mathbf{i}, \\mathbf{j})$, we have $\\mathbf{u} = u\\mathbf{i} + v\\mathbf{j}$ and $\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}$ is perpendicular to this plane.

            "solution": "The user has provided a well-posed problem in sea ice thermodynamics. The task is to calculate the steady-state surface temperature of a sea ice slab by solving the surface energy balance equation. The problem is scientifically grounded, free of contradictions, and contains all necessary information to proceed with a solution.\n\n### Principle-Based Design\n\nThe physical principle at the core of this problem is the conservation of energy at the sea ice surface. Under steady-state conditions and neglecting horizontal transport, the sum of all energy fluxes to and from the surface must be zero. The surface energy balance equation is given as:\n$$\nF(T_s) = (1-\\alpha)\\,S_{\\downarrow} + L_{\\downarrow} - \\varepsilon\\,\\sigma\\,T_s^4 - H(T_s) - \\mathrm{LE}(T_s) - G(T_s) = 0\n$$\nwhere $T_s$ is the unknown surface temperature. Each term represents a specific physical process:\n-   **Net Shortwave Radiation**: $(1-\\alpha)S_{\\downarrow}$ is the portion of incoming solar radiation absorbed by the surface, where $\\alpha$ is the albedo and $S_{\\downarrow}$ is the downwelling shortwave flux.\n-   **Downwelling Longwave Radiation**: $L_{\\downarrow}$ is the thermal radiation emitted by the atmosphere and clouds towards the surface.\n-   **Upwelling Longwave Radiation**: $\\varepsilon\\sigma T_s^4$ is the thermal radiation emitted by the surface, following the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Here, $\\varepsilon$ is the emissivity and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. This term introduces a strong nonlinearity.\n-   **Sensible Heat Flux**: $H(T_s) = \\rho_a c_p C_H U (T_s - T_a)$ is the turbulent heat exchange due to the temperature difference between the surface and the overlying air.\n-   **Latent Heat Flux**: $\\mathrm{LE}(T_s) = \\rho_a L_s C_E U (q_{si}(T_s) - q_a)$ is the energy exchange due to sublimation (phase change from ice to vapor) at the surface. This term is highly nonlinear because the saturation specific humidity at the surface, $q_{si}(T_s)$, is an exponential function of $T_s$.\n-   **Conductive Heat Flux**: $G(T_s) = k_i (T_s - T_b) / h$ is the heat conducted through the ice, driven by the temperature difference between the surface and the base of the ice, $T_b$.\n\nThe problem requires solving the nonlinear equation $F(T_s) = 0$ for $T_s$ using Newton's method. This iterative numerical technique finds successively better approximations to the root of a real-valued function. The iterative update rule is:\n$$\nT_s^{(k+1)} = T_s^{(k)} - \\frac{F(T_s^{(k)})}{F'(T_s^{(k)})}\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the iteration index and $F'(T_s) = dF/dT_s$ is the analytical derivative of the energy balance function with respect to the surface temperature.\n\nA critical step is to derive $F'(T_s)$. We differentiate each term of $F(T_s)$ with respect to $T_s$:\n$$\nF'(T_s) = \\frac{d}{dT_s} \\left( (1-\\alpha)S_{\\downarrow} + L_{\\downarrow} \\right) - \\frac{d}{dT_s}(\\varepsilon\\sigma T_s^4) - \\frac{d}{dT_s}(H(T_s)) - \\frac{d}{dT_s}(\\mathrm{LE}(T_s)) - \\frac{d}{dT_s}(G(T_s))\n$$\nThe derivatives of the individual flux components are:\n-   $\\frac{d}{dT_s}(\\varepsilon\\sigma T_s^4) = 4\\varepsilon\\sigma T_s^3$\n-   $\\frac{d}{dT_s}(H(T_s)) = \\frac{d}{dT_s}(\\rho_a c_p C_H U (T_s - T_a)) = \\rho_a c_p C_H U$\n-   $\\frac{d}{dT_s}(G(T_s)) = \\frac{d}{dT_s}(\\frac{k_i}{h}(T_s - T_b)) = \\frac{k_i}{h}$\n-   The derivative of the latent heat flux requires the chain rule for $\\frac{d}{dT_s}(q_{si}(T_s))$. The saturation specific humidity $q_{si}(T)$ is a function of the saturation vapor pressure over ice, $e_{si}(T)$, which in turn is a function of $T$.\n    $$\n    e_{si}(T) = e_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{L_s}{R_v}\\left(\\frac{1}{T_0} - \\frac{1}{T}\\right)\\right) \\implies \\frac{de_{si}}{dT} = e_{si}(T) \\frac{L_s}{R_v T^2}\n    $$\n    $$\n    q_{si}(T) = \\frac{\\epsilon e_{si}(T)}{p - (1-\\epsilon)e_{si}(T)} \\implies \\frac{dq_{si}}{de_{si}} = \\frac{\\epsilon p}{(p - (1-\\epsilon)e_{si}(T))^2}\n    $$\n    Applying the chain rule, $\\frac{dq_{si}}{dT} = \\frac{dq_{si}}{de_{si}} \\frac{de_{si}}{dT}$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{dq_{si}}{dT} = \\frac{\\epsilon p}{(p - (1-\\epsilon)e_{si}(T))^2} \\left( e_{si}(T) \\frac{L_s}{R_v T^2} \\right)\n    $$\n    The derivative of the latent heat flux is then:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d}{dT_s}(\\mathrm{LE}(T_s)) = \\rho_a L_s C_E U \\frac{dq_{si}}{dT_s}\n    $$\nThe complete derivative of the balance function is the sum of these negative contributions:\n$$\nF'(T_s) = -4\\varepsilon\\sigma T_s^3 - \\rho_a c_p C_H U - \\rho_a L_s C_E U \\frac{dq_{si}}{dT_s} - \\frac{k_i}{h}\n$$\n\nThe algorithmic implementation follows these steps:\n1.  **Initialization**: Set the initial guess for the surface temperature to the air temperature, $T_s^{(0)} = T_a$.\n2.  **Iteration**: For each iteration $n$ from $0$ to $N_{\\max}-1$:\n    a.  Calculate the residual $F(T_s^{(n)})$ and its derivative $F'(T_s^{(n)})$.\n    b.  Compute the Newton step: $\\Delta T_s = -F(T_s^{(n)}) / F'(T_s^{(n)})$.\n    c.  **Backtracking Line Search**: To ensure convergence, especially when far from the root, the full Newton step might be too large. A backtracking line search is employed. Starting with a step factor $\\lambda=1$, a trial temperature $T_{s, \\text{trial}} = T_s^{(n)} + \\lambda \\Delta T_s$ is computed. If the absolute residual at this trial temperature, $|F(T_{s, \\text{trial}})|$, is not less than the current residual, $|F(T_s^{(n)})|$, the step is too large. The factor $\\lambda$ is halved, and the process is repeated until a smaller residual is achieved. The trial temperature is also constrained to the physically plausible range $[200\\ \\mathrm{K}, 310\\ \\mathrm{K}]$.\n    d.  **Update**: The temperature is updated to the accepted trial value: $T_s^{(n+1)} = T_{s, \\text{trial}}$.\n    e.  **Convergence Check**: After the update, convergence is assessed using two criteria: the absolute value of the residual at the new temperature must be below a tolerance $\\tau_F$ (`abs(F(Ts_new))  tau_F`), and the magnitude of the temperature change in that step must be below a tolerance $\\tau_T$ (`abs(Ts_new - Ts_old)  tau_T`). If both are met, the iteration stops.\n3.  **Termination**: The process terminates if convergence is achieved or if the maximum number of iterations, $N_{\\max}$, is reached.\n\nThe final Python implementation encapsulates these physical principles and numerical methods into a robust solver that processes the provided test cases.",
