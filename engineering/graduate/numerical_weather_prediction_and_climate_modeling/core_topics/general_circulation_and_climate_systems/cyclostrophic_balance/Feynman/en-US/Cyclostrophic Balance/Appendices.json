            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the cyclostrophic wind equation from first principles and its application to a specified pressure field to find the azimuthal velocity profile, the maximum wind speed, and the radius at which this maximum occurs.\n\nThe governing equation for fluid motion is Newton's second law applied to a fluid parcel, which, in the absence of viscous forces, is the Euler equation:\n$$\n\\rho \\frac{D\\mathbf{u}}{Dt} = -\\nabla p\n$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the fluid density, $\\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity vector, $\\frac{D}{Dt}$ is the material derivative, and $\\nabla p$ is the pressure gradient force.

First, the derivation of the cyclostrophic balance equation and its application to find the pressure gradient, $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r}$. Second, the determination of the radius $r_m$ at which the tangential wind speed $V(r)$ is maximized.\n\nPart 1: Cyclostrophic Balance and Pressure Gradient\n\nWe begin with Newton's second law for a fluid parcel of mass $dm$ moving along a circular streamline of radius $r$ with a constant tangential velocity $V(r)$. The net force in the radial direction, $dF_r$, must provide the centripetal force required to maintain the circular motion. The centripetal acceleration is $a_r = -V^2/r$, where the negative sign indicates that the acceleration vector points inward, in the negative radial direction $(-\\hat{e}_r)$.\nThe equation of motion is:\n$$dF_r = (dm) a_r = -\\frac{V(r)^2}{r} dm$$\nThe problem states to neglect Coriolis and viscous effects. Therefore, the only force acting in the radial direction on the fluid parcel is due to the pressure gradient. For a parcel of volume $d\\mathcal{V}$, the pressure gradient force in the radial direction is $dF_{p,r} = -(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r}) d\\mathcal{V}$.\nThe mass of the parcel is $dm = \\rho d\\mathcal{V}$, where $\\rho$ is the constant density. Equating the pressure force with the required net force:\n$$-\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r} d\\mathcal{V} = -\\frac{V(r)^2}{r} (\\rho d\\mathcal{V})$$\nDividing both sides by $-d\\mathcal{V}$ yields the cyclostrophic balance equation:\n$$\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r} = \\frac{\\rho V(r)^2}{r}$$\nThis equation expresses the balance between the outward-directed pressure gradient force per unit volume and the centrifugal force per unit volume.\n\nWe are given the tangential wind profile for the Burgers vortex:\n$$V(r) = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi r}\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r^{2}}{a^{2}}\\right)\\right)$$\nSubstituting this expression into the cyclostrophic balance equation:\n$$\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r} = \\frac{\\rho}{r} \\left[ \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi r}\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r^{2}}{a^{2}}\\right)\\right) \\right]^2$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r} = \\frac{\\rho}{r} \\frac{\\Gamma^2}{4\\pi^2 r^2} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r^{2}}{a^{2}}\\right)\\right)^2$$\nSimplifying this expression gives the final form for the radial pressure gradient:\n$$\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r} = \\frac{\\rho \\Gamma^2}{4\\pi^2 r^3} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r^{2}}{a^{2}}\\right)\\right)^2$$\n\nPart 2: Radius of Maximum Wind Speed\n\nTo find the radius $r_m$ where the tangential wind $V(r)$ is at its maximum, we must find the critical points by setting the derivative $\\frac{dV}{dr}$ to zero. We use the quotient rule for differentiation on $V(r)=\\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi} \\frac{f(r)}{g(r)}$, where $f(r) = 1 - \\exp(-r^2/a^2)$ and $g(r) = r$.\nThe derivatives are $f'(r) = \\frac{2r}{a^2}\\exp(-r^2/a^2)$ and $g'(r) = 1$.\n$$\\frac{dV}{dr} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{f'(r)g(r) - f(r)g'(r)}{g(r)^2} \\right] = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi r^2} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{2r}{a^2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{r^2}{a^2}\\right)\\right)r - \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r^2}{a^2}\\right)\\right) \\right]$$\nSetting $\\frac{dV}{dr}=0$ for $r>0$, the term in the brackets must be zero:\n$$\\frac{2r^2}{a^2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{r^2}{a^2}\\right) - 1 + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r^2}{a^2}\\right) = 0$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{2r^2}{a^2} + 1\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r^2}{a^2}\\right) = 1$$\nTo solve this transcendental equation, we introduce the dimensionless squared radius $x = (r/a)^2$. The equation becomes:\n$$(2x + 1) \\exp(-x) = 1 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\exp(x) = 2x+1$$\nThis equation has two real solutions. One is $x=0$, which corresponds to $r=0$, where $V(r)=0$ (a minimum). The other solution gives the radius of maximum wind. To solve for the non-zero $x$, we employ the Lambert W function, which is defined as the solution $y=W(z)$ to the equation $z=y \\exp(y)$. We rearrange our equation to match this form. Let $u = 2x+1$, so $x=(u-1)/2$.\n$$1 = u \\exp\\left(-\\frac{u-1}{2}\\right) = u \\exp\\left(-\\frac{u}{2}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{e}} = u \\exp\\left(-\\frac{u}{2}\\right)$$\nNext, let $v = -u/2$, so $u=-2v$.\n$$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{e}} = (-2v) \\exp(v) \\implies -\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{e}} = v \\exp(v)$$\nThe solution for $v$ is $v = W\\left(-\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{e}}\\right)$. Since the argument is in the interval $(-1/e, 0)$, there are two real branches of the Lambert W function: the principal branch $W_0(z)$ and the lower branch $W_{-1}(z)$.\nFrom our substitutions, $x = (u-1)/2 = (-2v-1)/2 = -v-1/2$.\n1. The principal branch gives $v_0 = W_0\\left(-\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{e}}\\right) = -1/2$. This yields $x = -(-1/2) - 1/2 = 0$, corresponding to the minimum at $r=0$.\n2. The lower branch gives $v_m = W_{-1}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{e}}\\right)$, where $v_m < -1$. The corresponding $x$ value is $x_m = -v_m - 1/2$. Since $-v_m > 1$, $x_m > 1/2$. This is the positive solution corresponding to the maximum wind speed.\nSo, $x_m = -W_{-1}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{e}}\\right) - \\frac{1}{2}$.\nFinally, we find the radius $r_m$ from $r_m^2 = a^2 x_m$:\n$$r_m = \\sqrt{a^2 x_m} = a \\sqrt{-W_{-1}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{e}}\\right) - \\frac{1}{2}}$$\n\nThe two results are the expression for the pressure gradient and the radius of maximum wind speed.",

All parameters are physically realistic and dimensionally consistent. The problem asks for the derivation of the cyclostrophic balance from first principles and the construction of a corresponding numerical diagnostic test case, which is a standard procedure in the validation of computational fluid dynamics models.\n\nThe derivation of the governing radial momentum balance begins with Newton's Second Law for a continuous medium (the Cauchy momentum equation). For an inviscid fluid with density $\\rho$ and velocity field $\\vec{u}$, subject to a pressure field $p$ and no external body forces, the equation is:\n$$\n\\rho \\frac{D\\vec{u}}{Dt} = -\\nabla p\n$$\nwhere $\\frac{D}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\vec{u} \\cdot \\nabla$ is the material derivative.

Then $du = dr'$ and $v = -\\frac{a}{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2r'}{a}\\right)$.\n\\begin{align*}\n\\int r' \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2r'}{a}\\right) dr' &= r' \\left(-\\frac{a}{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2r'}{a}\\right)\\right) - \\int \\left(-\\frac{a}{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2r'}{a}\\right)\\right) dr' \\\\\n&= -\\frac{ar'}{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2r'}{a}\\right) - \\frac{a^2}{4} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2r'}{a}\\right) \\\\\n&= -\\frac{a^2}{4} \\left(1 + \\frac{2r'}{a}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2r'}{a}\\right)\n\\end{align*}\nEvaluating the definite integral from $r$ to $R_{\\text{out}}$:\n$$\n\\int_{r}^{R_{\\text{out}}} (\\dots) dr' = \\left[ -\\frac{a^2}{4} \\left(1 + \\frac{2r'}{a}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2r'}{a}\\right) \\right]_r^{R_{\\text{out}}} = -\\frac{a^2}{4} \\left[ \\left(1+\\frac{2R_{\\text{out}}}{a}\\right)e^{-\\frac{2R_{\\text{out}}}{a}} - \\left(1+\\frac{2r}{a}\\right)e^{-\\frac{2r}{a}} \\right]\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $p(r)$:\n$$\np(r) = p_\\infty - \\frac{\\rho_0 V_0^2}{a^2} \\left( -\\frac{a^2}{4} \\left[ \\left(1+\\frac{2R_{\\text{out}}}{a}\\right)e^{-\\frac{2R_{\\text{out}}}{a}} - \\left(1+\\frac{2r}{a}\\right)e^{-\\frac{2r}{a}} \\right] \\right)\n$$\nThe final analytic expression for the pressure is:\n$$\np(r) = p_\\infty + \\frac{\\rho_0 V_0^2}{4} \\left[ \\left(1 + \\frac{2R_{\\text{out}}}{a}\\right)e^{-\\frac{2R_{\\text{out}}}{a}} - \\left(1 + \\frac{2r}{a}\\right)e^{-\\frac{2r}{a}} \\right]\n$$\nThe axis regularity condition at $r=0$ requires finite gradients and accelerations.\n$\\lim_{r\\to 0} \\frac{V(r)^2}{r} = \\lim_{r\\to 0} \\frac{V_0^2 r}{a^2}\\exp(-\\frac{2r}{a}) = 0$.\n$\\lim_{r\\to 0} \\frac{1}{\\rho_0}\\frac{dp}{dr} = \\lim_{r\\to 0} \\frac{V_0^2 r}{a^2}\\exp(-\\frac{2r}{a}) = 0$.\nBoth terms vanish at the axis, satisfying the regularity condition.\n\nFor numerical validation, the residual of the cyclostrophic balance, $R(r_i)$, is computed on a uniform grid $r_i = i \\Delta r$ for $i=0, \\dots, N-1$ with $\\Delta r = R_{\\text{out}}/(N-1)$:\n$$\nR(r_i) = \\frac{V(r_i)^2}{r_i} - \\frac{1}{\\rho_0}\\left.\\frac{dp}{dr}\\right|_{\\text{FD}}(r_i)\n$$\nAt $r_0=0$, the term $\\frac{V(r)^2}{r}$ evaluates to $0$. The pressure gradient $\\frac{dp}{dr}$ is approximated using second-order finite differences:\n-   Interior points ($0 < i < N-1$): Central difference $\\left.\\frac{dp}{dr}\\right|_{i} \\approx \\frac{p_{i+1} - p_{i-1}}{2\\Delta r}$.\n-   Left boundary ($i=0$): Forward difference $\\left.\\frac{dp}{dr}\\right|_{0} \\approx \\frac{-3p_0 + 4p_1 - p_2}{2\\Delta r}$.\n-   Right boundary ($i=N-1$): Backward difference $\\left.\\frac{dp}{dr}\\right|_{N-1} \\approx \\frac{3p_{N-1} - 4p_{N-2} + p_{N-3}}{2\\Delta r}$.\n\nThe validation metrics are defined as:\n1.  Root-mean-square residual: $L_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} R(r_i)^2}$.\n2.  Maximum absolute residual: $L_\\infty = \\max_{i} |R(r_i)|$.\n3.  Observed order of convergence: $q = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{L_2(N)}{L_2(2N)}\\right)$.\n\nThe provided Python code implements this diagnostic test.",
