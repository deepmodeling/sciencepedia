The TKE, $k$, is defined as half the trace of the Reynolds stress tensor, representing the mean kinetic energy of the turbulent velocity fluctuations per unit mass. It has the dimensions of velocity squared. Therefore, a natural choice for the turbulent velocity scale is the square root of $k$:\n$$\nv_{turb} \\propto \\sqrt{k}\n$$\nThe dimensions of $\\sqrt{k}$ are $(\\sqrt{[\\mathrm{L}]^{2} [\\mathrm{T}]^{-2}}) = [\\mathrm{L}] [\\mathrm{T}]^{-1}$, which are indeed the dimensions of velocity.\n\nCombining these elements, the eddy viscosity $K_{m}$ can be expressed as:\n$$\nK_{m} = c_{\\mu} \\cdot v_{turb} \\cdot l = c_{\\mu} l \\sqrt{k}\n$$\nwhere $c_{\\mu}$ is the dimensionless closure coefficient that serves as the constant of proportionality. This expression is dimensionally consistent:\n$$\n[K_{m}] = [c_{\\mu}] [l] [\\sqrt{k}] = (1) \\cdot ([\\mathrm{L}]) \\cdot ([\\mathrm{L}][\\mathrm{T}]^{-1}) = [\\mathrm{L}]^{2}[\\mathrm{T}]^{-1}\n$$\nThis matches the required dimensions for eddy viscosity.\n\nNow, we can compute the numerical value of $K_{m}$ using the provided data:\n$k = 0.5 \\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$\n$l = 30 \\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$c_{\\mu} = 0.1$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $K_{m}$:\n$$\nK_{m} = (0.1) \\cdot (30 \\,\\mathrm{m}) \\cdot \\sqrt{0.5 \\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}}\n$$\n$$\nK_{m} = 3 \\,\\mathrm{m} \\cdot \\sqrt{0.5} \\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 3 \\sqrt{0.5} \\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nK_{m} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} \\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\approx 2.12132034... \\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\nK_{m} \\approx 2.121 \\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the kinematic turbulent shear stress, $-\\overline{u^{\\prime} w^{\\prime}}$, using the gradient-diffusion hypothesis:\n$$\n-\\overline{u^{\\prime} w^{\\prime}} = K_{m} \\, \\partial_{z} \\bar{u}\n$$\nWe use the unrounded value of $K_{m}$ for this calculation to maintain precision.

It is a standard, scientifically sound problem in atmospheric physics and does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation and Solution\n\n#### Part 1: Derivation of the Mean Transport Equation\n\nThe conservation law for a passive tracer with concentration $c$ in an incompressible flow with velocity field $\\mathbf{u}$ is given by the advection-diffusion equation. In flux form, this is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbf{u}c) = S + \\mathcal{D}_{mol}\n$$\nwhere $S$ is the source/sink term and $\\mathcal{D}_{mol}$ represents molecular diffusion.\n\nBased on the problem statement, we apply the following assumptions:\n1.  No internal sources or sinks: $S=0$.\n2.  Molecular diffusivity is negligible compared to turbulent transport: $\\mathcal{D}_{mol} \\approx 0$.\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbf{u}c) = 0\n$$\nIn Cartesian coordinates $(x,y,z)$, with velocity components $(u,v,w)$, this is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial(uc)}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial(vc)}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial(wc)}{\\partial z} = 0\n$$\nWe now apply a horizontal Reynolds average, denoted by an overbar, to each term. The averaging operator commutes with partial derivatives:\n$$\n\\overline{\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t}} + \\overline{\\frac{\\partial(uc)}{\\partial x}} + \\overline{\\frac{\\partial(vc)}{\\partial y}} + \\overline{\\frac{\\partial(wc)}{\\partial z}} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\overline{c}}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial \\overline{uc}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\overline{vc}}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial \\overline{wc}}{\\partial z} = 0\n$$\nThe problem states horizontal homogeneity, which implies that the average of any quantity does not vary in the horizontal directions, $x$ and $y$. Therefore, the horizontal flux divergence terms vanish:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\overline{uc}}{\\partial x} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial \\overline{vc}}{\\partial y} = 0\n$$\nThe averaged equation simplifies to a one-dimensional form in the vertical coordinate $z$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\overline{c}}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial \\overline{wc}}{\\partial z} = 0\n$$\nNext, we apply the Reynolds decomposition to the quantities $w$ and $c$: $w = \\overline{w} + w'$ and $c = \\overline{c} + c'$. The term $\\overline{wc}$ becomes:\n$$\n\\overline{wc} = \\overline{(\\overline{w} + w')(\\overline{c} + c')} = \\overline{\\overline{w}\\overline{c} + \\overline{w}c' + w'\\overline{c} + w'c'}\n$$\nUsing the properties of Reynolds averaging (e.g., $\\overline{A'} = 0$ and $\\overline{\\overline{A}B} = \\overline{A}\\overline{B}$), we get:\n$$\n\\overline{wc} = \\overline{w}\\overline{c} + \\overline{\\overline{w}c'} + \\overline{w'\\overline{c}} + \\overline{w'c'} = \\overline{w}\\overline{c} + \\overline{w}\\overline{c'} + \\overline{c}\\overline{w'} + \\overline{w'c'} = \\overline{w}\\overline{c} + \\overline{w'c'}\n$$\nThe mean transport equation is now:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\overline{c}}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(\\overline{w}\\overline{c} + \\overline{w'c'}) = 0\n$$\nWe are given that the mean vertical velocity is zero, $\\overline{w}=0$. This simplifies the equation further:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\overline{c}}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial (\\overline{w'c'})}{\\partial z} = 0\n$$\nThis equation states that the time rate of change of the mean concentration is balanced by the vertical divergence of the turbulent tracer flux, $\\overline{w'c'}$. To close the system, we use the provided eddy-diffusivity (K-theory) closure:\n$$\n\\overline{w'c'} = -K_c(z,t) \\frac{\\partial \\overline{c}}{\\partial z}\n$$\nSubstituting this closure into the mean transport equation yields the final one-dimensional equation for $\\overline{c}(z,t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\overline{c}}{\\partial t} - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\left(K_c(z,t) \\frac{\\partial \\overline{c}}{\\partial z}\\right) = 0\n$$\nThis is a one-dimensional, parabolic partial differential equation of the diffusion type.\n\n#### Part 2: Solution for the Steady-State Profile\n\nWe are asked to solve for the mean steady-state profile $\\overline{c}(z)$ under two additional conditions:\n1.  Steady conditions: $\\partial_t \\overline{c} = 0$.\n2.  Constant eddy diffusivity: $K_c=\\text{const}$.\n\nUnder steady conditions, the mean transport equation becomes:\n$$\n-\\frac{d}{dz}\\left(K_c \\frac{d \\overline{c}}{dz}\\right) = 0\n$$\nNote the use of ordinary derivatives as $\\overline{c}$ now depends only on $z$. Since $K_c$ is a non-zero constant, we can divide by it to obtain:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{d \\overline{c}}{dz}\\right) = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{d^2\\overline{c}}{dz^2} = 0\n$$\nThis is a simple second-order ordinary differential equation. We find the general solution by integrating twice with respect to $z$:\nFirst integration:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\overline{c}}{dz} = C_1\n$$\nSecond integration:\n$$\n\\overline{c}(z) = C_1 z + C_2\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants of integration determined by the boundary conditions. The boundary conditions are given as:\n- At $z=0$: $\\overline{c}(0) = c_0$\n- At $z=H$: $\\overline{c}(H) = c_H$\n\nApplying the first boundary condition at $z=0$:\n$$\n\\overline{c}(0) = C_1(0) + C_2 = c_0 \\quad \\implies \\quad C_2 = c_0\n$$\nApplying the second boundary condition at $z=H$:\n$$\n\\overline{c}(H) = C_1 H + C_2 = c_H\n$$\nSubstituting the value of $C_2=c_0$ into this equation:\n$$\nC_1 H + c_0 = c_H\n$$\nSolving for $C_1$:\n$$\nC_1 = \\frac{c_H - c_0}{H}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute the expressions for the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ back into the general solution $\\overline{c}(z) = C_1 z + C_2$:\n$$\n\\overline{c}(z) = \\left(\\frac{c_H - c_0}{H}\\right)z + c_0\n$$\nThis expression represents a linear profile of the mean tracer concentration with height. We can rearrange it into a form that clearly shows a weighted average of the boundary values:\n$$\n\\overline{c}(z) = c_0 + (c_H - c_0)\\frac{z}{H} = c_0\\left(1 - \\frac{z}{H}\\right) + c_H\\frac{z}{H}\n$$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the steady-state mean concentration profile.",
