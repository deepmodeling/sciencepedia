Two-Stream Eddington Approximation**\n\nThe Eddington approximation simplifies the RTE into a system of two ordinary differential equations for the upward ($F^\\uparrow$) and downward ($F^\\downarrow$) hemispheric fluxes. For isotropic scattering ($g=0$) and a normally incident beam ($\\mu_0=1$), the standard two-stream equations (e.g., from Meador  Weaver, 1980) are:\n$$\n\\frac{dF^\\uparrow}{d\\tau} = 2(1-\\omega_0) F^\\uparrow - 2\\omega_0 F^\\downarrow - \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_0 F_0 e^{-\\tau}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dF^\\downarrow}{d\\tau} = -2\\omega_0 F^\\uparrow + 2(1-\\omega_0) F^\\downarrow + \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_0 F_0 e^{-\\tau}\n$$\nThe boundary conditions are no diffuse downward flux at the top ($F^\\downarrow(0)=0$) and no upward flux from the black surface at the bottom ($F^\\uparrow(\\Delta\\tau)=0$).\nFor an optically thin layer $\\Delta\\tau \\ll 1$, we can approximate the fluxes as linear functions of $\\tau$. First, we evaluate the derivatives at $\\tau=0$:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{dF^\\uparrow}{d\\tau}\\right|_{\\tau=0} = 2(1-\\omega_0) F^\\uparrow(0) - 2\\omega_0 F^\\downarrow(0) - \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_0 F_0 = 2(1-\\omega_0) F^\\uparrow(0) - \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_0 F_0\n$$\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{dF^\\downarrow}{d\\tau}\\right|_{\\tau=0} = -2\\omega_0 F^\\uparrow(0) + 2(1-\\omega_0) F^\\downarrow(0) + \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_0 F_0 = -2\\omega_0 F^\\uparrow(0) + \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_0 F_0\n$$\nTo first order, we approximate the fluxes at $\\Delta\\tau$:\n$$\nF^\\uparrow(\\Delta\\tau) \\approx F^\\uparrow(0) + \\Delta\\tau \\left.\\frac{dF^\\uparrow}{d\\tau}\\right|_{\\tau=0}\n$$\n$$\nF^\\downarrow(\\Delta\\tau) \\approx F^\\downarrow(0) + \\Delta\\tau \\left.\\frac{dF^\\downarrow}{d\\tau}\\right|_{\\tau=0}\n$$\nUsing the boundary condition $F^\\uparrow(\\Delta\\tau)=0$:\n$$\n0 \\approx F^\\uparrow(0) + \\Delta\\tau \\left( 2(1-\\omega_0) F^\\uparrow(0) - \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_0 F_0 \\right)\n$$\nBy definition, the reflectance is $R = F^\\uparrow(0)/F_0$. Substituting this:\n$$\n0 \\approx R F_0 + \\Delta\\tau \\left( 2(1-\\omega_0) R F_0 - \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_0 F_0 \\right)\n$$\n$$\nR (1 + 2(1-\\omega_0)\\Delta\\tau) \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_0\\Delta\\tau\n$$\nSolving for $R$ and keeping only the first-order term in $\\Delta\\tau$:\n$$\nR \\approx \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}\\omega_0\\Delta\\tau}{1 + 2(1-\\omega_0)\\Delta\\tau} \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_0\\Delta\\tau \\left( 1 - 2(1-\\omega_0)\\Delta\\tau + \\dots \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_0\\Delta\\tau + \\mathcal{O}((\\Delta\\tau)^2)\n$$\nThis gives $R_1 = \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_0$.\nFor the transmittance, we find the diffuse component at the bottom:\n$$\nF^\\downarrow(\\Delta\\tau) \\approx \\Delta\\tau \\left.\\frac{dF^\\downarrow}{d\\tau}\\right|_{\\tau=0} = \\Delta\\tau \\left( -2\\omega_0 (R F_0) + \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_0 F_0 \\right)\n$$\nSubstitute the first-order expression $R \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_0\\Delta\\tau$:\n$$\nF^\\downarrow(\\Delta\\tau) \\approx \\Delta\\tau \\left( -2\\omega_0 (\\frac{1}{2}\\omega_0\\Delta\\tau) F_0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_0 F_0 \\right) = F_0 \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_0\\Delta\\tau - \\omega_0^2(\\Delta\\tau)^2 \\right)\n$$\nThe total transmittance is $T = (F_0 e^{-\\Delta\\tau} + F^\\downarrow(\\Delta\\tau))/F_0$. To first order:\n$$\nT \\approx (1-\\Delta\\tau) + \\frac{1}{F_0} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_0 F_0 \\Delta\\tau \\right) = 1 + (\\frac{1}{2}\\omega_0 - 1)\\Delta\\tau\n$$\nThis gives $T_1 = \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_0-1$. The Eddington approximation yields $(R_1, T_1) = (\\frac{1}{2}\\omega_0, \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_0-1)$, which is identical to the single-scattering result.\n\n**3. Delta-Eddington Approximation**\n\nThe Delta-Eddington approximation is designed for strongly forward-peaked scattering, characterized by an asymmetry parameter $g  0$. It transforms the optical properties of the medium to account for the highly forward-scattered radiation, which behaves as if it were transmitted without interaction. The transformation relations are:\n$$\n\\tau' = (1-\\omega_0 f)\\tau\n$$\n$$\n\\omega_0' = \\frac{\\omega_0(1-f)}{1-\\omega_0 f}\n$$\n$$\ng' = \\frac{g-f}{1-f}\n$$\nHere, $f$ is the fraction of scattering into the forward peak, typically approximated as $f=g^2$. The radiative transfer problem is then solved in the transformed system $(\\tau', \\omega_0', g')$.\nThe present problem specifies isotropic scattering, for which the asymmetry parameter $g=0$. Consequently, the forward-peaked fraction is $f = g^2 = 0$. Substituting $f=0$ into the transformation equations gives:\n$$\n\\tau' = (1-\\omega_0 \\cdot 0)\\tau = \\tau\n$$\n$$\n\\omega_0' = \\frac{\\omega_0(1-0)}{1-\\omega_0 \\cdot 0} = \\omega_0\n$$\n$$\ng' = \\frac{g-0}{1-0} = g = 0\n$$\nThe transformation is the identity map. The Delta-Eddington approximation for isotropic scattering ($g=0$) is therefore completely equivalent to the standard Eddington approximation. As such, it must produce the exact same results.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll three methods—the single-scattering approximation of the exact RTE, the two-stream Eddington approximation, and the Delta-Eddington approximation for isotropic scattering—produce identical first-order expansions for reflectance and transmittance in an optically thin layer. The coefficients are:\n$$\nR_1 = \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_0\n$$\n$$\nT_1 = \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_0 - 1\n$$\nThis agreement demonstrates that for optically thin media, where single scattering dominates, the two-stream approximations correctly capture the leading-order physics of radiative transfer.",

Let the transformed quantities be $\\xi'$ and $r'_{\\infty}$.\nThe term $(1-w_0')$ becomes:\n$$ 1-w_0' = 1 - \\frac{(1-g^2)w_0}{1 - w_0 g^2} = \\frac{1-w_0g^2 - w_0 + w_0g^2}{1-w_0g^2} = \\frac{1-w_0}{1-w_0g^2} $$\nThe term $(1-w_0'g')$ becomes:\n$$ 1-w_0'g' = 1 - \\left(\\frac{(1-g^2)w_0}{1-w_0g^2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{g}{1+g}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{w_0g(1-g)}{1-w_0g^2} = \\frac{1-w_0g^2 - w_0g + w_0g^2}{1-w_0g^2} = \\frac{1-w_0g}{1-w_0g^2} $$\nThe ratio determining $r'_{\\infty}$ is:\n$$ \\frac{1-w_0'}{1-w_0'g'} = \\frac{(1-w_0)/(1-w_0g^2)}{(1-w_0g)/(1-w_0g^2)} = \\frac{1-w_0}{1-w_0g} $$\nThis ratio is identical to the unscaled version. Therefore, the semi-infinite reflectance is invariant under this transformation: $r'_{\\infty} = r_{\\infty}$.\n\nThe transformed decay rate $\\xi'$ is:\n$$ \\xi'^2 = 3(1-w_0')(1-w_0'g') = 3\\left(\\frac{1-w_0}{1-w_0g^2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1-w_0g}{1-w_0g^2}\\right) = \\frac{3(1-w_0)(1-w_0g)}{(1-w_0g^2)^2} = \\frac{\\xi^2}{(1-w_0g^2)^2} $$\nSo, $\\xi' = \\frac{\\xi}{1-w_0g^2}$.\nThe argument of the exponentials in the $R$ and $T$ formulas is the product $\\xi\\tau$. The transformed product is:\n$$ \\xi'\\tau' = \\left(\\frac{\\xi}{1-w_0g^2}\\right) \\left((1-w_0g^2)\\tau\\right) = \\xi\\tau $$\nThis product is also invariant.\n\nThe reflectance $R_{\\delta}$ and transmittance $T_{\\delta}$ in the delta-Eddington approximation are found by substituting the primed quantities into the formulas from Part 1.\n$$ R_{\\delta} = R(\\tau', w_0', g') = \\frac{r'_{\\infty}(1-e^{-2\\xi'\\tau'})}{1 - r_{\\infty}'^2 e^{-2\\xi'\\tau'}} $$\nSince $r'_{\\infty} = r_{\\infty}$ and $\\xi'\\tau' = \\xi\\tau$, we have:\n$$ R_{\\delta} = \\frac{r_{\\infty}(1-e^{-2\\xi\\tau})}{1 - r_{\\infty}^2 e^{-2\\xi\\tau}} = R(\\tau, w_0, g) $$\nSimilarly for transmittance:\n$$ T_{\\delta} = T(\\tau', w_0', g') = \\frac{(1-r_{\\infty}'^2)e^{-\\xi'\\tau'}}{1 - r_{\\infty}'^2 e^{-2\\xi'\\tau'}} = \\frac{(1-r_{\\infty}^2)e^{-\\xi\\tau}}{1 - r_{\\infty}^2 e^{-2\\xi\\tau}} = T(\\tau, w_0, g) $$\nThus, for diffuse incidence on a layer over a black surface, the Eddington-approximated reflectance and transmittance are invariant under the delta-Eddington transformation with $f=g^2$. This means the differences $R_{\\delta}-R$ and $T_{\\delta}-T$ are analytically zero.\n\n### Part 3: Numerical Evaluation\n\nWe are given $w_0 = 0.999$, $g = 0.85$, and $\\tau = 10$.\n\nFirst, we compute the values for the standard Eddington approximation.\nThe decay rate constant $\\xi$:\n$$ \\xi = \\sqrt{3(1-0.999)(1-0.999 \\times 0.85)} = \\sqrt{3(0.001)(1-0.84915)} = \\sqrt{0.003 \\times 0.15085} = \\sqrt{0.00045255} \\approx 0.02127322 $$\nThe parameter for $r_{\\infty}$:\n$$ \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\\sqrt{\\frac{1-w_0}{1-w_0 g}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\\sqrt{\\frac{0.001}{0.15085}} \\approx 1.15470 \\times \\sqrt{0.0066291} \\approx 1.15470 \\times 0.0814193 \\approx 0.0940346 $$\nThe semi-infinite reflectance $r_{\\infty}$:\n$$ r_{\\infty} = \\frac{1 - 0.0940346}{1 + 0.0940346} = \\frac{0.9059654}{1.0940346} \\approx 0.828096 $$\nExponential terms with $\\xi\\tau \\approx 0.2127322$:\n$$ e^{-\\xi\\tau} \\approx \\exp(-0.2127322) \\approx 0.808365 $$\n$$ e^{-2\\xi\\tau} \\approx \\exp(-0.4254644) \\approx 0.653466 $$\nLayer reflectance $R$:\n$$ R = \\frac{r_{\\infty}(1-e^{-2\\xi\\tau})}{1 - r_{\\infty}^2 e^{-2\\xi\\tau}} = \\frac{0.828096 (1-0.653466)}{1 - (0.828096)^2 (0.653466)} = \\frac{0.828096 \\times 0.346534}{1 - 0.685743 \\times 0.653466} = \\frac{0.287040}{1-0.448189} = \\frac{0.287040}{0.551811} \\approx 0.52014 $$\nLayer transmittance $T$:\n$$ T = \\frac{(1-r_{\\infty}^2)e^{-\\xi\\tau}}{1 - r_{\\infty}^2 e^{-2\\xi\\tau}} = \\frac{(1-0.685743)(0.808365)}{0.551811} = \\frac{0.314257 \\times 0.808365}{0.551811} = \\frac{0.254034}{0.551811} \\approx 0.46036 $$\n\nAs shown analytically in Part 2, $R_{\\delta} = R$ and $T_{\\delta} = T$. Therefore, we expect to find $R_{\\delta} \\approx 0.52014$ and $T_{\\delta} \\approx 0.46036$. This means the differences are zero:\n$$ R_{\\delta} - R = 0 $$\n$$ T_{\\delta} - T = 0 $$\nThe final quantity requested is $\\Delta R = R_{\\delta} - R$. Based on this derivation, the exact value is $0$.",
