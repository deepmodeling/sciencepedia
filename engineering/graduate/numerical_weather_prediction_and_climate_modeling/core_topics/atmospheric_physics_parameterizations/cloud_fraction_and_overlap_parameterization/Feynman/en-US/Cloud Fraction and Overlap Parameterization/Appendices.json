The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined, provides all necessary data and definitions, and asks for specific, derivable expressions and computable values. A unique solution exists for each part.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, formal language from probability theory and atmospheric science, free from subjectivity or ambiguity (save for a minor point on the weighting direction of $\\alpha$, which is addressed in the derivation).\n\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe total column cloud fraction, $C$, is defined as the probability of the union of the two cloud events, $\\mathcal{A}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{A}_{2}$. Using the provided identity and substituting the given probabilities for the individual layers:\n$$C = P(\\mathcal{A}_{1} \\cup \\mathcal{A}_{2}) = P(\\mathcal{A}_{1}) + P(\\mathcal{A}_{2}) - P(\\mathcal{A}_{1} \\cap \\mathcal{A}_{2})$$\n$$C = f_{1} + f_{2} - P(\\mathcal{A}_{1} \\cap \\mathcal{A}_{2})$$\nThe derivation for each overlap assumption thus reduces to determining the form of the intersection probability, $P(\\mathcal{A}_{1} \\cap \\mathcal{A}_{2})$.\n\n**1. Random Overlap Assumption**\n\nUnder the random overlap assumption, the events $\\mathcal{A}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{A}_{2}$ are considered statistically independent. By the definition of statistical independence, the probability of their intersection is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$P(\\mathcal{A}_{1} \\cap \\mathcal{A}_{2})_{\\text{rand}} = P(\\mathcal{A}_{1}) P(\\mathcal{A}_{2}) = f_{1} f_{2}$$\nSubstituting this into the general expression for $C$, we obtain the total cloud fraction for random overlap, $C_{\\text{rand}}$:\n$$C_{\\text{rand}} = f_{1} + f_{2} - f_{1} f_{2}$$\n\n**2. Maximum Overlap Assumption**\n\nUnder the maximum overlap assumption, the spatial arrangement of the clouds is such that their overlap area is maximized. The intersection of two sets cannot be larger than either of the individual sets. In probabilistic terms, this is expressed by the inequalities $P(\\mathcal{A}_{1} \\cap \\mathcal{A}_{2}) \\le P(\\mathcal{A}_{1})$ and $P(\\mathcal{A}_{1} \\cap \\mathcal{A}_{2}) \\le P(\\mathcal{A}_{2})$. To maximize the intersection, we must have it equal to the smallest possible upper bound:\n$$P(\\mathcal{A}_{1} \\cap \\mathcal{A}_{2})_{\\text{max}} = \\min(P(\\mathcal{A}_{1}), P(\\mathcal{A}_{2})) = \\min(f_{1}, f_{2})$$\nSubstituting this into the general expression for $C$, we obtain the total cloud fraction for maximum overlap, $C_{\\text{max}}$:\n$$C_{\\text{max}} = f_{1} + f_{2} - \\min(f_{1}, f_{2})$$\nThis expression simplifies to $\\max(f_{1}, f_{2})$. To demonstrate this, consider two cases:\n- If $f_{1} \\ge f_{2}$, then $\\min(f_{1}, f_{2}) = f_{2}$. The expression becomes $C_{\\text{max}} = f_{1} + f_{2} - f_{2} = f_{1} = \\max(f_{1}, f_{2})$.\n- If $f_{1} < f_{2}$, then $\\min(f_{1}, f_{2}) = f_{1}$. The expression becomes $C_{\\text{max}} = f_{1} + f_{2} - f_{1} = f_{2} = \\max(f_{1}, f_{2})$.\nThus, for maximum overlap, the total cloud fraction is simply the fraction of the larger of the two clouds:\n$$C_{\\text{max}} = \\max(f_{1}, f_{2})$$\n\n**3. Blended Overlap**\n\nThe problem specifies a blended model where the intersection measure is a linear interpolation between the random and maximum overlap cases, weighted by a parameter $\\alpha \\in [0,1]$. We will adopt the convention that $\\alpha$ represents the weighting of the maximum overlap structure, such that $\\alpha=1$ corresponds to pure maximum overlap and $\\alpha=0$ to pure random overlap.\nThe intersection probability for the blended case is therefore:\n$$P(\\mathcal{A}_{1} \\cap \\mathcal{A}_{2})_{\\text{blend}} = \\alpha \\cdot P(\\mathcal{A}_{1} \\cap \\mathcal{A}_{2})_{\\text{max}} + (1-\\alpha) \\cdot P(\\mathcal{A}_{1} \\cap \\mathcal{A}_{2})_{\\text{rand}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the maximum and random intersection probabilities:\n$$P(\\mathcal{A}_{1} \\cap \\mathcal{A}_{2})_{\\text{blend}} = \\alpha \\min(f_{1}, f_{2}) + (1-\\alpha) f_{1} f_{2}$$\nNow, we substitute this blended intersection into the general formula for $C$:\n$$C_{\\text{blend}} = f_{1} + f_{2} - \\left[ \\alpha \\min(f_{1}, f_{2}) + (1-\\alpha) f_{1} f_{2} \\right]$$\nThis can be rearranged by regrouping terms with $\\alpha$:\n$$C_{\\text{blend}} = f_{1} + f_{2} - \\alpha \\min(f_{1}, f_{2}) - f_{1} f_{2} + \\alpha f_{1} f_{2}$$\n$$C_{\\text{blend}} = \\alpha \\left( f_{1} + f_{2} - \\min(f_{1}, f_{2}) \\right) + (1-\\alpha) \\left( f_{1} + f_{2} - f_{1} f_{2} \\right)$$\nRecognizing the terms in the parentheses as the expressions for $C_{\\text{max}}$ and $C_{\\text{rand}}$:\n$$C_{\\text{blend}} = \\alpha C_{\\text{max}} + (1-\\alpha) C_{\\text{rand}}$$\nThis demonstrates that linearly interpolating the intersection probability is equivalent to linearly interpolating the total cloud fraction.\n\n**Numerical Computation**\n\nWe are given the values $f_{1}=0.6$, $f_{2}=0.3$, and $\\alpha=0.5$.\n\n- For random overlap:\n$$C_{\\text{rand}} = f_{1} + f_{2} - f_{1}f_{2} = 0.6 + 0.3 - (0.6)(0.3) = 0.9 - 0.18 = 0.72$$\n- For maximum overlap:\n$$C_{\\text{max}} = \\max(f_{1}, f_{2}) = \\max(0.6, 0.3) = 0.6$$\n- For blended overlap:\nUsing the simplified expression with $\\alpha=0.5$:\n$$C_{\\text{blend}} = (0.5) C_{\\text{max}} + (1-0.5) C_{\\text{rand}} = 0.5(0.6) + 0.5(0.72) = 0.3 + 0.36 = 0.66$$\nThe problem requires the results to be dimensionless decimal fractions rounded to four significant figures.\n$C_{\\text{rand}} = 0.7200$\n$C_{\\text{max}} = 0.6000$\n$C_{\\text{blend}} = 0.6600$\n\nThe final answer is presented as a row matrix $\\bigl(C_{\\text{rand}},\\,C_{\\text{max}},\\,C_{\\text{blend}}\\bigr)$.",

The problem is objective and free of any non-scientific claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe total water mixing ratio $q_t$ is a normally distributed random variable, $q_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\bar{q}, \\sigma_q^2)$. Its probability density function (PDF) is given by:\n$$p(q_t) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_q \\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(q_t - \\bar{q})^2}{2\\sigma_q^2}\\right)$$\nThe cloud fraction $f_c$ is the probability that $q_t$ exceeds the saturation mixing ratio $q_s$:\n$$f_c = \\mathbb{P}(q_t > q_s) = \\int_{q_s}^{\\infty} p(q_t) \\, dq_t = \\int_{q_s}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sigma_q \\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(q_t - \\bar{q})^2}{2\\sigma_q^2}\\right) \\, dq_t$$\nTo evaluate this integral, we perform a change of variables to standardize the distribution. Let $z = \\frac{q_t - \\bar{q}}{\\sigma_q}$. This implies $dq_t = \\sigma_q dz$. The lower limit of integration for $z$ becomes $\\frac{q_s - \\bar{q}}{\\sigma_q}$. The upper limit remains $\\infty$.\n$$f_c = \\int_{\\frac{q_s - \\bar{q}}{\\sigma_q}}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sigma_q \\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z^2}{2}\\right) (\\sigma_q dz) = \\int_{\\frac{q_s - \\bar{q}}{\\sigma_q}}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z^2}{2}\\right) dz$$\nThis integral is the tail probability of the standard normal distribution. It is related to the standard normal cumulative distribution function (CDF), $\\Phi(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{x} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp(-t^2/2) dt$, and the complementary error function, $\\text{erfc}(x) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\int_{x}^{\\infty} \\exp(-t^2) dt$. The relationship is $1 - \\Phi(x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{erfc}(x/\\sqrt{2})$.\nThus, the cloud fraction $f_c$ can be expressed in a closed form:\n$$f_c = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{erfc}\\left(\\frac{q_s - \\bar{q}}{\\sqrt{2}\\sigma_q}\\right)$$\nThis is the first required expression.\n\nNext, we consider the case where the subgrid variance is inflated. The new standard deviation is $\\sigma_q' = \\gamma \\sigma_q$. The corresponding cloud fraction, $f_c'$, is found by substituting $\\sigma_q$ with $\\sigma_q'$ in the expression for $f_c$:\n$$f_c' = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{erfc}\\left(\\frac{q_s - \\bar{q}}{\\sqrt{2}\\sigma_q'}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{erfc}\\left(\\frac{q_s - \\bar{q}}{\\sqrt{2}\\gamma\\sigma_q}\\right)$$\nThis is the second required expression.\n\nNow we proceed to the numerical calculation.

To verify its self-consistency, we check if the given probabilities are valid and if the individual joint probabilities are consistent with the total column cover via the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nThe principle of inclusion-exclusion states:\n$$C = \\mathbb{P}(A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup A_3) = \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\mathbb{P}(A_i) - \\sum_{i<j} \\mathbb{P}(A_i \\cap A_j) + \\mathbb{P}(A_1 \\cap A_2 \\cap A_3)$$\nUsing the provided values:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{ie}} = (f_1 + f_2 + f_3) - (J_{12,\\mathrm{obs}} + J_{13,\\mathrm{obs}} + J_{23,\\mathrm{obs}}) + J_{123,\\mathrm{obs}}$$\n$$C_{\\mathrm{ie}} = (0.3 + 0.4 + 0.2) - (0.18 + 0.08 + 0.12) + 0.07$$\n$$C_{\\mathrm{ie}} = 0.9 - 0.38 + 0.07 = 0.52 + 0.07 = 0.59$$\nThe result $C_{\\mathrm{ie}} = 0.59$ exactly matches the given $C_{\\mathrm{obs}} = 0.59$. The provided data are internally consistent. All given probabilities are between $0$ and $1$. The joint probabilities are smaller than or equal to the marginal probabilities, as required (e.g., $J_{12,\\mathrm{obs}} = 0.18 \\le \\min(f_1, f_2) = 0.3$).\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, self-consistent, and well-posed. It is valid. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n---\n\n### Task 1: Derivation of Expressions for Column Cover\n\n**1. Column Cover under Random Overlap (Independence)**\n\nThe column cover $C$ is the probability of the union of events $A_1$, $A_2$, and $A_3$. It is often easier to calculate this via the complement event: the probability that the column is clear. The event of a clear column is that layer $1$ is clear, AND layer $2$ is clear, AND layer $3$ is clear. Let $A_i^c$ be the complement of $A_i$ (clear sky in layer $i$).\nThe probability of a clear layer is $\\mathbb{P}(A_i^c) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(A_i) = 1 - f_i$.\nThe column cloud cover is $C = \\mathbb{P}(A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup A_3)$. By De Morgan's laws, the complement of this union is the intersection of the complements: $(A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup A_3)^c = A_1^c \\cap A_2^c \\cap A_3^c$.\nThus, $C = 1 - \\mathbb{P}((A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup A_3)^c) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(A_1^c \\cap A_2^c \\cap A_3^c)$.\n\nThe random overlap assumption posits that the events $A_1$, $A_2$, $A_3$ are mutually independent. A property of independence is that if events are independent, their complements are also independent. Therefore:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(A_1^c \\cap A_2^c \\cap A_3^c) = \\mathbb{P}(A_1^c) \\mathbb{P}(A_2^c) \\mathbb{P}(A_3^c) = (1 - f_1)(1 - f_2)(1 - f_3)$$\nSubstituting this back gives the expression for column cover under random overlap, $C_{\\mathrm{rand}}$:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{rand}} = 1 - (1 - f_1)(1 - f_2)(1 - f_3)$$\n\n**2. Exact Inclusion–Exclusion Identity**\n\nThe principle of inclusion-exclusion for three events provides an exact expression for the probability of their union, without any assumptions about independence.\n$$C = \\mathbb{P}(A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup A_3) = \\mathbb{P}(A_1) + \\mathbb{P}(A_2) + \\mathbb{P}(A_3) - \\mathbb{P}(A_1 \\cap A_2) - \\mathbb{P}(A_1 \\cap A_3) - \\mathbb{P}(A_2 \\cap A_3) + \\mathbb{P}(A_1 \\cap A_2 \\cap A_3)$$\nIn terms of the variables defined in the problem, this is:\n$$C = (f_1 + f_2 + f_3) - (\\mathbb{P}(A_1 \\cap A_2) + \\mathbb{P}(A_1 \\cap A_3) + \\mathbb{P}(A_2 \\cap A_3)) + \\mathbb{P}(A_1 \\cap A_2 \\cap A_3)$$\n\n### Task 2: Numerical Calculations and Consistency Check\n\n**(i) Independent-Overlap Prediction ($C_{\\mathrm{rand}}$)**\n\nUsing the derived formula and given layer fractions $f_1 = 0.3$, $f_2 = 0.4$, $f_3 = 0.2$:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{rand}} = 1 - (1 - 0.3)(1 - 0.4)(1 - 0.2)$$\n$$C_{\\mathrm{rand}} = 1 - (0.7)(0.6)(0.8)$$\n$$C_{\\mathrm{rand}} = 1 - (0.42)(0.8) = 1 - 0.336$$\n$$C_{\\mathrm{rand}} = 0.664$$\n\n**(ii) Inclusion–Exclusion Reconstruction ($C_{\\mathrm{ie}}$)**\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion identity and the full set of observed data:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{ie}} = (0.3 + 0.4 + 0.2) - (0.18 + 0.08 + 0.12) + 0.07$$\n$$C_{\\mathrm{ie}} = 0.9 - 0.38 + 0.07 = 0.59$$\nAs established during validation, this matches $C_{\\mathrm{obs}}$, confirming data consistency.\n\n**(iii) Consistency Check for Independence**\n\nThe necessary and sufficient condition for the events $A_1$, $A_2$, $A_3$ to be mutually independent (the \"random overlap\" assumption) is that the probability of the intersection of any subset of these events equals the product of their individual probabilities. This requires checking four conditions:\n1.  $\\mathbb{P}(A_1 \\cap A_2) = \\mathbb{P}(A_1)\\mathbb{P}(A_2) = f_1 f_2$\n2.  $\\mathbb{P}(A_1 \\cap A_3) = \\mathbb{P}(A_1)\\mathbb{P}(A_3) = f_1 f_3$\n3.  $\\mathbb{P}(A_2 \\cap A_3) = \\mathbb{P}(A_2)\\mathbb{P}(A_3) = f_2 f_3$\n4.  $\\mathbb{P}(A_1 \\cap A_2 \\cap A_3) = \\mathbb{P}(A_1)\\mathbb{P}(A_2)\\mathbb{P}(A_3) = f_1 f_2 f_3$\n\nLet's apply this check by comparing the observed joint probabilities ($J_{\\mathrm{obs}}$) to the values predicted by independence:\n-   **Check 1:** $f_1 f_2 = 0.3 \\times 0.4 = 0.12$. The observed value is $J_{12,\\mathrm{obs}} = 0.18$. Since $0.18 \\ne 0.12$, this condition is violated.\n-   **Check 2:** $f_1 f_3 = 0.3 \\times 0.2 = 0.06$. The observed value is $J_{13,\\mathrm{obs}} = 0.08$. Since $0.08 \\ne 0.06$, this condition is violated.\n-   **Check 3:** $f_2 f_3 = 0.4 \\times 0.2 = 0.08$. The observed value is $J_{23,\\mathrm{obs}} = 0.12$. Since $0.12 \\ne 0.08$, this condition is violated.\n-   **Check 4:** $f_1 f_2 f_3 = 0.3 \\times 0.4 \\times 0.2 = 0.024$. The observed value is $J_{123,\\mathrm{obs}} = 0.07$. Since $0.07 \\ne 0.024$, this condition is violated.\n\nSince all four conditions for independence are violated, the random overlap assumption is invalid for the given data.\n\nFurthermore, we observe a consistent pattern:\n-   $J_{12,\\mathrm{obs}} = 0.18 > f_1 f_2 = 0.12$\n-   $J_{13,\\mathrm{obs}} = 0.08 > f_1 f_3 = 0.06$\n-   $J_{23,\\mathrm{obs}} = 0.12 > f_2 f_3 = 0.08$\n-   $J_{123,\\mathrm{obs}} = 0.07 > f_1 f_2 f_3 = 0.024$\n\nThis pattern, where the joint probability of cloudiness is greater than what is expected from random chance, indicates a positive correlation between cloudiness in different layers. This corresponds to more vertical overlap than random. This increased overlap means that for the same layer cloud fractions, the total column cover is reduced compared to the random case. This is consistent with our finding that $C_{\\mathrm{obs}} = 0.59$ is less than $C_{\\mathrm{rand}} = 0.664$.\n\n### Task 3: Evaluation of Options\n\n**A.** This option states that the necessary and sufficient check for random overlap is that all measured joint occurrences equal the products of the corresponding $f_i$. This is the correct definition of mutual independence. It then notes that this condition is violated for the given data, correctly identifying that $J_{ij,\\mathrm{obs}} > f_i f_j$, $J_{123,\\mathrm{obs}} > f_1 f_2 f_3$, and $C_{\\mathrm{obs}} < C_{\\mathrm{rand}}$. My calculations confirm all these inequalities. Finally, it correctly concludes that the random overlap assumption is invalid and that the pattern indicates positive vertical correlation (more overlap than random). The statement that the check on joint occurrences is \"equivalent\" to the check on total cover is a slight mathematical imprecision (the former implies the latter, but not vice-versa), but the overall conclusion and supporting evidence are correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B.** This option claims that agreement of $C_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ with $C_{\\mathrm{rand}}$ is sufficient for random overlap. This is false; matching the total cover is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the underlying events to be independent. Joint probabilities could deviate from independence in a way that coincidentally cancels out in the final sum. Furthermore, the option's premise is factually wrong for the given data, as my calculation shows $C_{\\mathrm{obs}}=0.59$ and $C_{\\mathrm{rand}}=0.664$, which do not agree.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C.** This option incorrectly claims that random overlap cannot be falsified by joint occurrences. This is a direct contradiction of the mathematical definition of statistical independence, which is fundamentally about joint probabilities. The proposed test, comparing $C_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ to $\\sum_i f_i$, is not a test for random overlap. The sum itself, $\\sum_i f_i = 0.9$, is an upper bound for $C$ under the maximum-random overlap assumption, but comparing it to $C_{\\mathrm{obs}} = 0.59$ does not validate or invalidate the random overlap case specifically.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D.** This option proposes an incorrect and incomplete \"practical sufficiency check\" for random overlap, ignoring some of the required independence conditions. Mutual independence is not guaranteed by pairwise independence of adjacent layers only. The condition \"if $C_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ matches the inclusion–exclusion reconstruction $C_{\\mathrm{ie}}$\" is a tautology, as $C_{\\mathrm{ie}}$ is simply the calculation of the probability of the union from its constituent parts, which will always equal $C_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ for a consistent dataset. Finally, the premise that the proposed criterion holds for the data is false; my calculations show $J_{12,\\mathrm{obs}} \\ne f_1 f_2$ and $J_{23,\\mathrm{obs}} \\ne f_2 f_3$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nBased on the analysis, option A provides the correct assessment of the problem.",
