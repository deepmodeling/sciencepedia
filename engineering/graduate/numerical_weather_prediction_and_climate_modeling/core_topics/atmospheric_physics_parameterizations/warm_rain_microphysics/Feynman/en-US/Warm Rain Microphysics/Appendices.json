            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of mass diffusion and cloud microphysics, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is expressed objectively.\n\nWe begin by modeling the condensational growth of a single spherical droplet. The process is governed by the diffusion of water vapor from the ambient air to the droplet surface. We assume a quasi-steady state for the water vapor field, which means the vapor density field adjusts instantaneously to changes in the droplet's radius. This implies that the time derivative of the vapor density, $\\rho_v$, is zero. The conservation of mass for water vapor, $\\frac{\\partial \\rho_v}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\vec{J}_v = 0$, thus simplifies to $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{J}_v = 0$, where $\\vec{J}_v$ is the diffusive flux of water vapor.\n\nAccording to Fick's first law of diffusion, the flux is given by $\\vec{J}_v = -D_v \\nabla \\rho_v$, where $D_v$ is the diffusivity of water vapor in air. Combining these gives the Laplace equation for the vapor density field around the droplet:\n$$ \\nabla^2 \\rho_v = 0 $$\nAssuming spherical symmetry, the Laplacian operator simplifies, and the equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{1}{R^2} \\frac{d}{dR} \\left( R^2 \\frac{d\\rho_v}{dR} \\right) = 0 $$\nwhere $R$ is the radial distance from the center of the droplet. Integrating this equation twice with respect to $R$ yields the general solution for the vapor density profile:\n$$ \\rho_v(R) = C_1 + \\frac{C_2}{R} $$\nThe integration constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ are determined by the boundary conditions.\n1. In the far-field ($R \\to \\infty$), the vapor density approaches the ambient value, $\\rho_{v,\\infty}$. This gives $C_1 = \\rho_{v,\\infty}$.\n2. At the droplet surface ($R=r$), the air is assumed to be saturated. Neglecting curvature and solute effects, the vapor density is the saturation vapor density at the ambient temperature, $\\rho_{v,s}(T_{\\infty})$. So, $\\rho_v(r) = \\rho_{v,s}(T_{\\infty})$. This gives $\\rho_{v,s}(T_{\\infty}) = \\rho_{v,\\infty} + \\frac{C_2}{r}$, which implies $C_2 = r(\\rho_{v,s}(T_{\\infty}) - \\rho_{v,\\infty})$.\n\nThe vapor density field is therefore:\n$$ \\rho_v(R) = \\rho_{v,\\infty} - (\\rho_{v,\\infty} - \\rho_{v,s}(T_{\\infty})) \\frac{r}{R} $$\nThe total mass flux of water vapor to the droplet surface is found by evaluating the flux density at $R=r$ and multiplying by the surface area of the droplet, $4\\pi r^2$. The radial flux density is $J_{v,R} = -D_v \\frac{d\\rho_v}{dR}$.\n$$ \\frac{d\\rho_v}{dR} = (\\rho_{v,\\infty} - \\rho_{v,s}(T_{\\infty})) \\frac{r}{R^2} $$\nThe rate of mass increase of the droplet is:\n$$ \\frac{dm}{dt} = 4\\pi r^2 J_{v,R}(r) = 4\\pi r^2 \\left( -D_v \\left[ (\\rho_{v,\\infty} - \\rho_{v,s}(T_{\\infty})) \\frac{r}{r^2} \\right] \\right) = 4\\pi r D_v (\\rho_{v,\\infty} - \\rho_{v,s}(T_{\\infty})) $$\nThe mass of the spherical droplet is $m = \\rho_l \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, where $\\rho_l$ is the density of liquid water. Its rate of change is:\n$$ \\frac{dm}{dt} = \\rho_l \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\\right) = 4\\pi r^2 \\rho_l \\frac{dr}{dt} = 4\\pi r^2 \\rho_l \\dot{r} $$\nEquating the two expressions for $\\frac{dm}{dt}$:\n$$ 4\\pi r^2 \\rho_l \\dot{r} = 4\\pi r D_v (\\rho_{v,\\infty} - \\rho_{v,s}(T_{\\infty})) $$\nSolving for the radial growth rate, $\\dot{r}$:\n$$ \\dot{r} = \\frac{D_v (\\rho_{v,\\infty} - \\rho_{v,s}(T_{\\infty}))}{\\rho_l r} $$\nThe supersaturation $S$ is defined as $S = \\frac{e_{\\infty}}{e_s(T_{\\infty})} - 1$, where $e_{\\infty}$ and $e_s(T_\\infty)$ are the ambient and saturation vapor pressures. Using the ideal gas law for water vapor, $e = \\rho_v R_v T$, we have $\\rho_{v,\\infty} = \\frac{e_{\\infty}}{R_v T_{\\infty}}$ and $\\rho_{v,s}(T_{\\infty}) = \\frac{e_s(T_{\\infty})}{R_v T_{\\infty}}$. The density difference can be written as:\n$$ \\rho_{v,\\infty} - \\rho_{v,s}(T_{\\infty}) = \\frac{e_{\\infty} - e_s(T_{\\infty})}{R_v T_{\\infty}} = \\frac{S \\cdot e_s(T_{\\infty})}{R_v T_{\\infty}} = S \\cdot \\rho_{v,s}(T_{\\infty}) $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\dot{r}$:\n$$ \\dot{r} = \\frac{D_v S \\rho_{v,s}(T_{\\infty})}{\\rho_l r} $$\nNow we derive the requested timescales.\nThe diffusion timescale, $t_{\\mathrm{diff}}$, is the characteristic time for the vapor field to diffuse over a length scale $r$:\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{diff}} = \\frac{r^2}{D_v} $$\nThe condensational growth timescale, $t_{\\mathrm{grow}}$, is the characteristic time for the droplet's radius to increase significantly, defined as $t_{\\mathrm{grow}} \\equiv r/\\dot{r}$:\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{grow}} = \\frac{r}{\\dot{r}} = r \\left( \\frac{\\rho_l r}{D_v S \\rho_{v,s}(T_{\\infty})} \\right) = \\frac{\\rho_l r^2}{D_v S \\rho_{v,s}(T_{\\infty})} $$\nThe problem provides the definition of the interface Péclet number, $\\mathrm{Pe} \\equiv \\frac{r\\,\\dot{r}}{D_{v}}$. This dimensionless number compares the rate of boundary movement to the rate of diffusion. A small Péclet number ($\\mathrm{Pe} \\ll 1$) indicates that diffusion is much faster than the boundary movement, justifying the quasi-steady state assumption. Using the derived expression for $\\dot{r}$:\n$$ \\mathrm{Pe} = \\frac{r}{D_v} \\left( \\frac{D_v S \\rho_{v,s}(T_{\\infty})}{\\rho_l r} \\right) = \\frac{S \\rho_{v,s}(T_{\\infty})}{\\rho_l} $$\nWe can also express $\\mathrm{Pe}$ as the ratio of the two timescales:\n$$ \\mathrm{Pe} = \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{diff}}}{t_{\\mathrm{grow}}} = \\frac{r^2/D_v}{\\rho_l r^2 / (D_v S \\rho_{v,s}(T_{\\infty}))} = \\frac{S \\rho_{v,s}(T_{\\infty})}{\\rho_l} $$\nTo evaluate $\\mathrm{Pe}$ numerically, we first calculate the saturation vapor density $\\rho_{v,s}(T_{\\infty})$ using the provided values: $T_{\\infty} = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $e_{s}(T_{\\infty}) = 3168\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, and $R_{v} = 461\\,\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$.\n$$ \\rho_{v,s}(T_{\\infty}) = \\frac{e_{s}(T_{\\infty})}{R_v T_{\\infty}} = \\frac{3168\\,\\mathrm{Pa}}{(461\\,\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}})(298\\,\\mathrm{K})} = \\frac{3168}{137378}\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}} \\approx 0.023060\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}} $$\nNow we can compute the Péclet number using $S = 0.02$ and $\\rho_l = 1000\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$:\n$$ \\mathrm{Pe} = \\frac{(0.02)(0.023060\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}})}{1000\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}} = \\frac{0.0004612}{1000} = 4.612 \\times 10^{-7} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the result is $4.61 \\times 10^{-7}$. The extremely small value confirms the validity of the quasi-steady state approximation for this problem.

Derivation of the drag coefficient multiplier $M_{C}(\\chi)$**\n\nThe shape-induced multiplier for the drag coefficient is defined as the ratio of the referenced drag coefficient for the oblate spheroid to that for the equivalent sphere:\n$$M_{C}(\\chi) = \\frac{C_{d, \\mathrm{ellip}}^{(\\mathrm{ref})}}{C_{d, \\mathrm{sph}}^{(\\mathrm{ref})}}$$\nThe referenced drag coefficient, $C_{d}^{(\\mathrm{ref})}$, is defined with respect to the cross-sectional area of the equivalent-volume sphere, $\\pi r_{e}^{2}$:\n$$C_{d}^{(\\mathrm{ref})} = \\frac{F_{d}}{\\frac{1}{2}\\rho_{a} v^{2}\\pi r_{e}^{2}}$$\nwhere $F_d$ is the drag force, $\\rho_a$ is the air density, and $v$ is the fall speed.\n\nThe problem states that the intrinsic drag coefficient, $C_{d,0}$, is approximately constant for both bluff bodies when referenced to their own projected areas. The drag force is given by:\n$$F_d = C_{d,0} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\rho_{a} v^{2} \\right) A_{\\mathrm{proj}}$$\nFor the oblate spheroid, the projected area is $A_{\\mathrm{ellip}} = \\pi a^{2}$. The drag force is:\n$$F_{d, \\mathrm{ellip}} = C_{d,0} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\rho_{a} v^{2} \\right) (\\pi a^{2})$$\nSubstituting this into the definition of the referenced drag coefficient for the spheroid:\n$$C_{d, \\mathrm{ellip}}^{(\\mathrm{ref})} = \\frac{C_{d,0} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\rho_{a} v^{2} \\right) (\\pi a^{2})}{\\frac{1}{2}\\rho_{a} v^{2}\\pi r_{e}^{2}} = C_{d,0} \\frac{a^{2}}{r_{e}^{2}}$$\nFor the equivalent-volume sphere, the projected area is $A_{\\mathrm{sph}} = \\pi r_{e}^{2}$. The drag force is:\n$$F_{d, \\mathrm{sph}} = C_{d,0} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\rho_{a} v^{2} \\right) (\\pi r_{e}^{2})$$\nThe referenced drag coefficient for the sphere is therefore:\n$$C_{d, \\mathrm{sph}}^{(\\mathrm{ref})} = \\frac{C_{d,0} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\rho_{a} v^{2} \\right) (\\pi r_{e}^{2})}{\\frac{1}{2}\\rho_{a} v^{2}\\pi r_{e}^{2}} = C_{d,0}$$\nNow we take the ratio to find $M_C(\\chi)$:\n$$M_{C}(\\chi) = \\frac{C_{d, \\mathrm{ellip}}^{(\\mathrm{ref})}}{C_{d, \\mathrm{sph}}^{(\\mathrm{ref})}} = \\frac{C_{d,0} \\frac{a^{2}}{r_{e}^{2}}}{C_{d,0}} = \\left(\\frac{a}{r_e}\\right)^{2}$$\nUsing our previously derived geometric ratio $\\frac{a}{r_e} = \\chi^{-1/3}$:\n$$M_{C}(\\chi) = \\left(\\chi^{-1/3}\\right)^{2} = \\chi^{-2/3}$$\n\n**2. Derivation of the terminal fall speed correction factor $M_{v}(\\chi)$**\n\nThe terminal fall speed correction factor is the ratio of the terminal speed of the oblate spheroid, $v_{t}^{(\\mathrm{ellip})}$, to that of the equivalent-volume sphere, $v_{t}^{(\\mathrm{sph})}$:\n$$M_{v}(\\chi) = \\frac{v_{t}^{(\\mathrm{ellip})}}{v_{t}^{(\\mathrm{sph})}}$$\nAt steady terminal fall, the aerodynamic drag force $F_d$ is balanced by the net gravitational force $F_{g}'$, which is the gravitational force minus the buoyant force. This net force is given by $F_{g}' = (\\rho_{w} - \\rho_{a})gV$, where $\\rho_w$ is the density of the water drop and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. Since the volume $V$ is the same for the spheroid and the sphere, the net gravitational force $F_{g}'$ is identical for both objects.\n\nThus, at their respective terminal velocities, their drag forces must be equal:\n$$F_{d, \\mathrm{ellip}}(v_{t}^{(\\mathrm{ellip})}) = F_{d, \\mathrm{sph}}(v_{t}^{(\\mathrm{sph})})$$\nUsing the formula for drag force with the intrinsic drag coefficient $C_{d,0}$:\n$$C_{d,0} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\rho_{a} (v_{t}^{(\\mathrm{ellip})})^{2} \\right) A_{\\mathrm{ellip}} = C_{d,0} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\rho_{a} (v_{t}^{(\\mathrm{sph})})^{2} \\right) A_{\\mathrm{sph}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the projected areas, $A_{\\mathrm{ellip}} = \\pi a^{2}$ and $A_{\\mathrm{sph}} = \\pi r_{e}^{2}$:\n$$C_{d,0} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\rho_{a} (v_{t}^{(\\mathrm{ellip})})^{2} \\right) (\\pi a^{2}) = C_{d,0} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\rho_{a} (v_{t}^{(\\mathrm{sph})})^{2} \\right) (\\pi r_{e}^{2})$$\nThe common factors of $C_{d,0}$, $\\frac{1}{2}\\rho_{a}$, and $\\pi$ cancel out, leaving:\n$$(v_{t}^{(\\mathrm{ellip})})^{2} a^{2} = (v_{t}^{(\\mathrm{sph})})^{2} r_{e}^{2}$$\nRearranging to find the ratio of the speeds:\n$$\\frac{(v_{t}^{(\\mathrm{ellip})})^{2}}{(v_{t}^{(\\mathrm{sph})})^{2}} = \\frac{r_{e}^{2}}{a^{2}} = \\left(\\frac{r_e}{a}\\right)^{2}$$\nTaking the square root of both sides gives the desired ratio $M_v(\\chi)$:\n$$M_{v}(\\chi) = \\frac{v_{t}^{(\\mathrm{ellip})}}{v_{t}^{(\\mathrm{sph})}} = \\frac{r_e}{a}$$\nSince we found that $\\frac{a}{r_e} = \\chi^{-1/3}$, the inverse ratio is $\\frac{r_e}{a} = \\chi^{1/3}$.\nTherefore, the terminal fall speed correction factor is:\n$$M_{v}(\\chi) = \\chi^{1/3}$$\n\nThe two requested expressions are $M_{C}(\\chi) = \\chi^{-2/3}$ and $M_{v}(\\chi) = \\chi^{1/3}$.",
