This foundational exercise  guides you through a first-principles calculation of the Cloud Radiative Effect (CRE) by comparing a clear-sky scenario with a cloudy one. By separating the shortwave and longwave components, you will gain a quantitative appreciation for why a cloud's net climatic impact depends critically on its properties, such as its altitude and temperature.",

Adopt the convention that net downward radiative flux at the TOA is positive and equals absorbed shortwave radiation (ASR) minus outgoing longwave radiation (OLR).

A clear-sky column characterized by a broadband planetary shortwave albedo $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{clr}}$ and a clear-sky effective emission temperature $T_{e}$.\n2.

The assumptions are common in introductory atmospheric physics. The problem is well-defined, self-contained, and scientifically sound. Thus, the problem is valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe net TOA flux in the clear-sky state, $N_{\\mathrm{clr}}$, is given by:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{clr}} = ASR_{\\mathrm{clr}} - OLR_{\\mathrm{clr}}$$\nThe Absorbed Shortwave Radiation for the clear-sky case, $ASR_{\\mathrm{clr}}$, is the incoming solar radiation, $Q$, that is not reflected. The fraction reflected is the albedo, $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{clr}}$.\n$$ASR_{\\mathrm{clr}} = Q(1 - \\alpha_{\\mathrm{clr}})$$\nThe Outgoing Longwave Radiation for the clear-sky case, $OLR_{\\mathrm{clr}}$, is determined by the clear-sky effective emission temperature, $T_{e}$, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n$$OLR_{\\mathrm{clr}} = \\sigma T_{e}^{4}$$\nCombining these, the net flux for the clear-sky case is:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{clr}} = Q(1 - \\alpha_{\\mathrm{clr}}) - \\sigma T_{e}^{4}$$\nSimilarly, the net TOA flux in the overcast-cloud state, $N_{\\mathrm{cld}}$, is:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{cld}} = ASR_{\\mathrm{cld}} - OLR_{\\mathrm{cld}}$$\nThe Absorbed Shortwave Radiation for the cloudy case, $ASR_{\\mathrm{cld}}$, is:\n$$ASR_{\\mathrm{cld}} = Q(1 - \\alpha_{\\mathrm{cld}})$$\nThe Outgoing Longwave Radiation for the cloudy case, $OLR_{\\mathrm{cld}}$, is determined by the cloud-top temperature, $T_{c}$, as the problem states the cloud behaves as a blackbody emitter.\n$$OLR_{\\mathrm{cld}} = \\sigma T_{c}^{4}$$\nCombining these, the net flux for the cloudy case is:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{cld}} = Q(1 - \\alpha_{\\mathrm{cld}}) - \\sigma T_{c}^{4}$$\nThe net Cloud Radiative Effect ($CRE$) at the TOA is defined as the difference between the net flux with clouds and the net flux without clouds (clear-sky).\n$$CRE = N_{\\mathrm{cld}} - N_{\\mathrm{clr}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $N_{\\mathrm{cld}}$ and $N_{\\mathrm{clr}}$:\n$$CRE = \\left[ Q(1 - \\alpha_{\\mathrm{cld}}) - \\sigma T_{c}^{4} \\right] - \\left[ Q(1 - \\alpha_{\\mathrm{clr}}) - \\sigma T_{e}^{4} \\right]$$\nThis expression can be rearranged by grouping the shortwave (albedo-related) and longwave (temperature-related) terms:\n$$CRE = \\left[ Q(1 - \\alpha_{\\mathrm{cld}}) - Q(1 - \\alpha_{\\mathrm{clr}}) \\right] + \\left[ \\sigma T_{e}^{4} - \\sigma T_{c}^{4} \\right]$$\n$$CRE = Q(\\alpha_{\\mathrm{clr}} - \\alpha_{\\mathrm{cld}}) + \\sigma(T_{e}^{4} - T_{c}^{4})$$\nThis equation reveals the two competing effects of clouds. The first term, $Q(\\alpha_{\\mathrm{clr}} - \\alpha_{\\mathrm{cld}})$, is the shortwave cloud radiative effect, $CRE_{SW}$. Since clouds are generally more reflective than the surface below, $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{cld}} > \\alpha_{\\mathrm{clr}}$, making this term negative (a cooling effect). The second term, $\\sigma(T_{e}^{4} - T_{c}^{4})$, is the longwave cloud radiative effect, $CRE_{LW}$. For high clouds, as in this problem, the cloud top is much colder than the effective emission temperature of the clear sky ($T_c  T_e$), so this term is positive (a warming or greenhouse effect).\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values into the derived expression for $CRE$.\nFirst, calculate the average insolation $Q$:\n$$Q = \\frac{S_{0}}{4} = \\frac{1361\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}}{4} = 340.25\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$$\nNext, calculate the shortwave component, $CRE_{SW}$:\n$$CRE_{SW} = Q(\\alpha_{\\mathrm{clr}} - \\alpha_{\\mathrm{cld}}) = (340.25\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}) \\times (0.15 - 0.30)$$\n$$CRE_{SW} = (340.25\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}) \\times (-0.15) = -51.0375\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$$\nNow, calculate the longwave component, $CRE_{LW}$:\n$$CRE_{LW} = \\sigma(T_{e}^{4} - T_{c}^{4}) = (5.670374419 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-4}}) \\times \\left[ (255\\ \\mathrm{K})^{4} - (225\\ \\mathrm{K})^{4} \\right]$$\n$$T_{e}^{4} = (255)^{4} = 4,228,250,625\\ \\mathrm{K}^{4}$$\n$$T_{c}^{4} = (225)^{4} = 2,562,890,625\\ \\mathrm{K}^{4}$$\n$$T_{e}^{4} - T_{c}^{4} = 1,665,360,000\\ \\mathrm{K}^{4}$$\n$$CRE_{LW} = (5.670374419 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-4}}) \\times (1,665,360,000\\ \\mathrm{K}^{4}) \\approx 94.429907\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$$\nFinally, sum the two components to find the net $CRE$:\n$$CRE = CRE_{SW} + CRE_{LW} = -51.0375\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}} + 94.429907\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$$\n$$CRE \\approx 43.392407\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$$\nThe problem asks for the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$CRE = 43.39\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$$\nThis positive value indicates that for a high, cold cloud with the given properties, the longwave warming effect dominates the shortwave cooling effect, resulting in a net warming of the planet.",

The parameterization of cloud optical properties in terms of liquid water path and effective radius, and the application of the delta-Eddington approximation, are standard, valid techniques in climate modeling and remote sensing.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution consists of three main parts: 1) derivation and calculation of the layer optical thickness $\\tau$, 2) evaluation of the intrinsic single-scattering albedo $\\omega_{0}$ and asymmetry parameter $g$, and 3) calculation of the delta-Eddington scaled parameters $\\tau'$, $\\omega_{0}'$, and $g'$.\n\n**1. Optical Thickness ($\\tau$)**\n\nThe optical thickness of a vertically inhomogeneous medium is defined as the integral of the extinction coefficient, $\\beta_{ext}$, along the vertical path from the cloud bottom, $z_{bot}$, to the cloud top, $z_{top}$:\n$$ \\tau = \\int_{z_{bot}}^{z_{top}} \\beta_{ext}(z) dz $$\nFor a population of cloud droplets, a widely used parameterization for $\\beta_{ext}$ in the geometric optics regime (where droplet radius is much larger than the wavelength) relates it to the liquid water content, $w(z)$, and the effective radius, $r_e(z)$:\n$$ \\beta_{ext}(z) \\approx \\frac{3 w(z)}{2 \\rho_w r_e(z)} $$\nHere, $\\rho_w$ is the density of liquid water. This approximation assumes an extinction efficiency of $Q_{ext} \\approx 2$.\n\nSubstituting this expression into the definition of $\\tau$ gives:\n$$ \\tau = \\int_{z_{bot}}^{z_{top}} \\frac{3 w(z)}{2 \\rho_w r_e(z)} dz $$\nThe problem states that $r_e$ exhibits negligible vertical variation. Thus, $r_e$ and the constant $\\rho_w$ can be moved outside the integral:\n$$ \\tau = \\frac{3}{2 \\rho_w r_e} \\int_{z_{bot}}^{z_{top}} w(z) dz $$\nThe integral of the liquid water content over the depth of the cloud is, by definition, the liquid water path, $L$:\n$$ L = \\int_{z_{bot}}^{z_{top}} w(z) dz $$\nThis yields the final expression for optical thickness:\n$$ \\tau = \\frac{3 L}{2 \\rho_w r_e} $$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values, ensuring consistent units (SI):\n$L = 0.15\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-2}}$\n$\\rho_w = 1.0 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$\n$r_e = 10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n\n$$ \\tau = \\frac{3 \\times 0.15}{2 \\times (1.0 \\times 10^3) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-5})} = \\frac{0.45}{0.02} = 22.5 $$\n\n**2. Intrinsic Radiative Properties ($\\omega_{0}$ and $g$)**\n\nThe single-scattering albedo, $\\omega_0$, is the ratio of the scattering coefficient to the extinction coefficient, $\\omega_0 = \\beta_{sca} / \\beta_{ext}$. The problem explicitly states that \"absorption by liquid water droplets is negligible\" in the visible band. This implies that the absorption coefficient $\\beta_{abs} \\approx 0$, and therefore the extinction is due entirely to scattering ($\\beta_{ext} = \\beta_{sca} + \\beta_{abs} \\approx \\beta_{sca}$). Consequently, the single-scattering albedo is:\n$$ \\omega_0 = 1 $$\nThe asymmetry parameter, $g$, which represents the mean cosine of the scattering angle, is given in the problem statement:\n$$ g = 0.85 $$\n\n**3. Delta-Eddington Scaled Properties ($\\tau'$, $\\omega_{0}'$, $g'$)**\n\nThe delta-Eddington approximation improves the accuracy of two-stream radiative transfer models for highly forward-scattering phase functions. It does this by replacing the forward-scattering peak with a delta function and renormalizing the remaining radiative properties. The standard scaling transformations are:\n$$ \\tau' = (1 - \\omega_0 f) \\tau $$\n$$ \\omega_0' = \\frac{(1 - f) \\omega_0}{1 - \\omega_0 f} $$\n$$ g' = \\frac{g - f}{1 - f} $$\nHere, $f$ is the fraction of scattered energy in the forward peak. The problem specifies using the Henyey-Greenstein-based approximation $f=g^2$:\n$$ f = g^2 = (0.85)^2 = 0.7225 $$\nSubstituting the values for $\\tau$, $\\omega_0$, $g$, and $f$ into the transformation equations:\n$$ \\tau' = (1 - (1)(0.7225)) \\times 22.5 = 0.2775 \\times 22.5 = 6.24375 $$\n$$ \\omega_0' = \\frac{(1 - 0.7225) \\times 1}{1 - (1)(0.7225)} = \\frac{0.2775}{0.2775} = 1 $$\n$$ g' = \\frac{0.85 - 0.7225}{1 - 0.7225} = \\frac{0.1275}{0.2775} \\approx 0.459459... $$\n\n**Final Result Compilation**\n\nThe six required quantities are compiled and rounded to four significant figures as requested:\n- $\\tau = 22.5 \\rightarrow 22.50$\n- $\\omega_0 = 1 \\rightarrow 1.000$\n- $g = 0.85 \\rightarrow 0.8500$\n- $\\tau' = 6.24375 \\rightarrow 6.244$\n- $\\omega_0' = 1 \\rightarrow 1.000$\n- $g' = 0.459459... \\rightarrow 0.4595$\n\nThese are presented as a six-component row vector $(\\tau, \\omega_{0}, g, \\tau', \\omega_{0}', g')$.",

In many shortwave radiative transfer approximations for liquid clouds, the cloud optical thickness scales approximately as the liquid water path divided by $r_e$ when other factors (e.g., refractive index, mixing state) are fixed. The gamma PSD here yields a larger effective radius than the lognormal PSD by a factor of about $16.26/14.32 \\approx 1.135$. For the same $q_x$ (and column liquid water), using the gamma PSD would therefore imply a smaller optical thickness and reduced reflectance compared to the lognormal PSD, illustrating that microphysical assumptions about PSD shape can materially affect the radiation–microphysics coupling even when bulk condensate and number are fixed.",
