            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the Monin-Obukhov length, $L$, from first principles within the framework of Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST), followed by a numerical calculation of the stability parameter $\\zeta = z/L$.\n\nWe begin with the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) budget equation for the atmospheric surface layer under the Boussinesq approximation. For a stationary and horizontally homogeneous flow, the budget simplifies to a balance between shear production ($P$), buoyant production or destruction ($B$), turbulent transport ($T$), and viscous dissipation ($\\varepsilon$):\n$$ 0 = P + B + T - \\varepsilon $$\nThe terms are defined as:\n1.  Shear Production, $P$: This term represents the rate at which mean flow kinetic energy is converted into turbulent kinetic energy via Reynolds stresses. Assuming the mean wind is aligned with the x-axis, it is given by:\n    $$ P = -\\overline{u'w'} \\frac{\\partial \\overline{u}}{\\partial z} $$\n    In the surface layer, the vertical momentum flux is approximately constant with height and equal to its surface value, so $-\\overline{u'w'} \\approx u_*^2$, where $u_*$ is the friction velocity. Thus,\n    $$ P \\approx u_*^2 \\frac{\\partial \\overline{u}}{\\partial z} $$\n\n2.  Buoyant Production/Destruction, $B$: This term represents the rate at which potential energy is converted into TKE (production) or TKE is converted into potential energy (destruction). It is given by:\n    $$ B = \\frac{g}{\\overline{\\theta_v}} \\overline{w'\\theta_v'} $$\n    where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $\\overline{\\theta_v}$ is the mean virtual potential temperature of the layer, and $\\overline{w'\\theta_v'}$ is the surface kinematic buoyancy flux. If $\\overline{w'\\theta_v'}  0$ (upward heat flux, unstable conditions), $B  0$ and buoyancy produces TKE. If $\\overline{w'\\theta_v'}  0$ (downward heat flux, stable conditions), $B  0$ and buoyancy destroys TKE.\n\n3.  Dissipation, $\\varepsilon$: The rate at which TKE is converted into internal energy by viscosity. It is always a sink term, $\\varepsilon  0$.\n\n4.  Turbulent Transport, $T$: This term, $T = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(\\overline{w'e} + \\overline{w'p'}/\\rho_0)$, represents the vertical divergence of the TKE flux and pressure-velocity correlation flux, which redistributes TKE vertically.\n\nThe Monin-Obukhov length, $L$, is defined as the characteristic height at which the rate of shear production of TKE is balanced by the rate of buoyant production or destruction. At this height, turbulent eddies are influenced equally by mechanical and buoyant forces. To find this scale, we set the magnitudes of $P$ and $B$ to be equal. The problem requires using the logarithmic-law scaling for the mean shear, which is the form that applies in the neutral limit ($z/L \\to 0$):\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\overline{u}}{\\partial z} = \\frac{u_*}{\\kappa z} $$\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the von Kármán constant. This is a key assumption in the derivation of $L$, as it provides the shear scaling in the limit dominated by mechanical turbulence.\n\nSubstituting this expression for the shear into the shear production term gives:\n$$ P \\approx u_*^2 \\left( \\frac{u_*}{\\kappa z} \\right) = \\frac{u_*^3}{\\kappa z} $$\nNow, we define $L$ as the height ($z=L$) at which shear production is counteracted by buoyancy. The conventional definition sets $P = -B$ at $z=L$:\n$$ \\frac{u_*^3}{\\kappa L} = - \\frac{g}{\\overline{\\theta_v}} \\overline{w'\\theta_v'} $$\nSolving for $L$, we obtain the expression for the Monin-Obukhov length:\n$$ L = -\\frac{u_*^3 \\overline{\\theta_v}}{\\kappa g \\overline{w'\\theta_v'}} $$\nThis expression encapsulates the balance between mechanical turbulence (numerator, driven by $u_*$) and thermal turbulence (denominator, driven by the buoyancy flux).\n\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values:\n- Friction velocity, $u_* = 0.4 \\text{ m s}^{-1}$\n- von Kármán constant, $\\kappa = 0.4$\n- Gravitational acceleration, $g = 9.81 \\text{ m s}^{-2}$\n- Surface kinematic buoyancy flux, $\\overline{w'\\theta_v'} = -0.05 \\text{ K m s}^{-1}$\n- Mean virtual potential temperature, $\\overline{\\theta_v} = 300 \\text{ K}$\n\nPlugging these values into the expression for $L$:\n$$ L = - \\frac{(0.4)^3 \\cdot 300}{0.4 \\cdot 9.81 \\cdot (-0.05)} = \\frac{(0.4)^2 \\cdot 300}{9.81 \\cdot 0.05} $$\n$$ L = \\frac{0.16 \\cdot 300}{0.4905} = \\frac{48}{0.4905} \\approx 97.8593 \\text{ m} $$\nThe positive sign of $L$ is consistent with the negative (downward) buoyancy flux, indicating stable stratification.\n\nNext, we calculate the dimensionless stability parameter, $\\zeta$, at the height $z = 10 \\text{ m}$:\n$$ \\zeta = \\frac{z}{L} = \\frac{10}{97.8593} \\approx 0.102188 $$\nThe sign of $\\zeta$ is used to classify the atmospheric stability regime:\n- $\\zeta  0$: Unstable conditions (buoyancy enhances turbulence).\n- $\\zeta = 0$: Neutral conditions (buoyancy has no effect).\n- $\\zeta  0$: Stable conditions (buoyancy suppresses turbulence).\n\nSince $\\zeta \\approx 0.102  0$, the stability regime at $z = 10$ m is classified as **stable**.\n\nRounding the numerical value of $\\zeta$ to three significant figures as required:\n$$ \\zeta \\approx 0.102 $$",
