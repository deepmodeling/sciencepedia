The numerical values provided for the fluxes are physically realistic for midday, clear-sky conditions over land. The problem is well-posed; it provides all necessary information to determine the single unknown variable, $G$, using the surface energy balance equation. The sign convention is explicitly and clearly defined, preventing ambiguity. The problem is objective and free of any speculative or non-scientific claims. All criteria for a valid problem are met.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe first part of the problem requires the computation of the ground heat flux, $G$. This is governed by the principle of conservation of energy for a control volume at the land-atmosphere interface. Assuming negligible heat storage in the surface skin and canopy air, the surface energy balance equation states that the net radiative energy input must be balanced by the sum of the turbulent fluxes of sensible and latent heat to the atmosphere and the conductive heat flux into the ground.\n\nThe surface energy balance equation is:\n$$R_n = H + LE + G$$\nHere, each term represents a flux density in units of $\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$. The problem explicitly defines the sign convention: $R_n$ is positive downward (an energy gain for the surface), while $H$ and $LE$ are positive upward (energy losses from the surface). The ground heat flux $G$ is defined as positive downward (an energy loss from the surface into the soil). The equation as written is consistent with this sign convention, where the source term ($R_n$) equals the sum of the sink terms ($H$, $LE$, and $G$).\n\nTo compute the ground heat flux $G$, we rearrange the energy balance equation:\n$$G = R_n - H - LE$$\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$R_n = 500\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$$\n$$H = 150\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$$\n$$LE = 280\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$$\n\nWe calculate $G$:\n$$G = 500 - 150 - 280$$\n$$G = 500 - 430$$\n$$G = 70\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$$\nThe resulting ground heat flux is $70\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for a discussion of the physical meaning of the sign of $G$ based on first principles. The conductive heat flux in a medium is described by Fourier's law of heat conduction. Let us define a vertical coordinate $z$ that is zero at the surface and positive downward into the soil. In this coordinate system, Fourier's law for the vertical heat flux $G$ is:\n$$G = -k \\frac{\\partial T_s}{\\partial z}$$\nwhere $k$ is the soil thermal conductivity (a positive definite property, $k > 0$) and $\\frac{\\partial T_s}{\\partial z}$ is the vertical gradient of soil temperature, $T_s$.\n\nThe sign of $G$ is thus determined by the sign of the vertical temperature gradient, $-\\frac{\\partial T_s}{\\partial z}$.\n- **Positive Ground Heat Flux ($G > 0$):** Our calculation yielded $G = 70\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$, which is positive. According to Fourier's law, a positive $G$ requires that $-k \\frac{\\partial T_s}{\\partial z} > 0$. Since $k > 0$, this implies $\\frac{\\partial T_s}{\\partial z} < 0$. A negative temperature gradient in our coordinate system ($z$ positive downward) means that soil temperature decreases with increasing depth. This physical situation occurs during the day, particularly around local midday as specified in the problem, when solar radiation heats the surface to a temperature higher than the soil layers below it. The positive sign of $G$ signifies a downward flux of heat, transferring energy from the warm surface into the cooler subsurface soil, representing energy storage in the ground.\n\n- **Negative Ground Heat Flux ($G < 0$):** Conversely, a negative value for $G$ would imply an upward flux of heat from the soil to the surface. This occurs when the surface is cooler than the soil beneath it. According to Fourier's law, for $G < 0$, we must have $\\frac{\\partial T_s}{\\partial z} > 0$ (since $-k$ is negative). A positive temperature gradient (with $z$ positive downward) means that temperature increases with depth. This typically happens at night, when the surface cools by emitting longwave radiation more rapidly than the insulated soil below. The negative $G$ represents the release of heat that was stored in the soil during the day.\n\n- **Relation to Thermal Inertia:** The magnitude of $G$ is related to the soil's thermal inertia, $I$, which is a measure of its resistance to temperature change. Thermal inertia is defined as $I = \\sqrt{kC}$, where $k$ and $C$ are the bulk soil thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity, respectively.\n    - A soil with **high thermal inertia** (e.g., wet, dense soil) can absorb and release large amounts of heat with only a small change in surface temperature. Such a soil will exhibit a large amplitude in its diurnal cycle of $G$—a large positive $G$ during the day and a large-magnitude negative $G$ at night. This efficient heat transfer into and out of the ground dampens the diurnal range of the surface temperature.\n    - A soil with **low thermal inertia** (e.g., dry, loose sand) has poor thermal conductivity and/or low heat capacity. It cannot efficiently conduct heat away from the surface. Consequently, for a given radiative forcing, the surface temperature will rise sharply during the day, but the ground heat flux $G$ will be relatively small. At night, there is less stored heat to be released, so the magnitude of the negative $G$ is also small, and the surface cools dramatically. This leads to a large diurnal range in surface temperature.\n\nIn summary, the calculated positive value of $G$ is physically consistent with midday conditions, indicating heat flow into the soil driven by a surface that is warmer than the subsurface. The magnitude of this flux, in relation to the net radiation, is modulated by the soil's thermal inertia.",
