            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the specular albedo of a calm water surface and its numerical computation for a given solar zenith angle. The derivation begins from the fundamental principles of electromagnetism, specifically the boundary conditions for electric and magnetic fields at the interface between two dielectric media.\n\nWe consider a planar interface at $z=0$ separating two lossless, homogeneous, non-magnetic media. Medium 1 (air) has refractive index $n_1$ and medium 2 (water) has refractive index $n_2$. A monochromatic plane electromagnetic wave is incident from medium 1 at an angle $\\theta_i$ to the normal. The wave is partially reflected at the same angle $\\theta_r = \\theta_i$ and partially transmitted (refracted) into medium 2 at an angle $\\theta_t$.\n\nThe electromagnetic boundary conditions dictate that the tangential components of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ and the magnetic field $\\vec{H}$ must be continuous across the interface at $z=0$. The phase of all waves must match at the boundary, which leads to Snell's law:\n$$ n_1 \\sin\\theta_i = n_2 \\sin\\theta_t $$\n\nWe analyze the reflection for two orthogonal linear polarization states of the incident electric field: perpendicular polarization ($s$-polarization) and parallel polarization ($p$-polarization) relative to the plane of incidence (the plane containing the incident, reflected, and transmitted wave vectors).\n\n**1. Perpendicular ($s$) Polarization**\n\nFor $s$-polarization, the electric field vector $\\vec{E}$ is perpendicular to the plane of incidence. Let the plane of incidence be the $x-z$ plane, so $\\vec{E}$ is in the $y$-direction. The electric fields of the incident ($i$), reflected ($r$), and transmitted ($t$) waves at the boundary ($z=0$) can be written in terms of their amplitudes $E_{0i}$, $E_{0r}$, and $E_{0t}$:\n$$ \\vec{E}_i = E_{0i} \\hat{y}, \\quad \\vec{E}_r = E_{0r} \\hat{y}, \\quad \\vec{E}_t = E_{0t} \\hat{y} $$\nContinuity of the tangential component of $\\vec{E}$ gives:\n$$ E_{0i} + E_{0r} = E_{0t} \\quad (1) $$\nThe corresponding magnetic fields $\\vec{H}$ lie in the plane of incidence and are related to the electric fields by the impedance of the medium.

This quantity represents the specular albedo ($A_{spec}$) of the surface.\n$$ A_{spec} = \\frac{1}{2} (R_s + R_p) $$\n\n**4. Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are given the following values:\nSolar zenith angle $\\theta_{s} = 60^{\\circ}$, so the incidence angle is $\\theta_i = 60^{\\circ}$.\nRefractive index of air, $n_1 = 1$.\nRefractive index of water, $n_2 = 1.33$.\n\nFirst, we find the transmission angle $\\theta_t$ using Snell's Law:\n$$ n_1 \\sin\\theta_i = n_2 \\sin\\theta_t $$\n$$ \\sin\\theta_t = \\frac{n_1}{n_2} \\sin\\theta_i = \\frac{1}{1.33} \\sin(60^{\\circ}) $$\nWe need $\\cos\\theta_i$ and $\\cos\\theta_t$:\n$$ \\cos\\theta_i = \\cos(60^{\\circ}) = 0.5 $$\n$$ \\cos\\theta_t = \\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2\\theta_t} = \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{\\sin(60^{\\circ})}{1.33}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(\\sqrt{3}/2)^2}{1.33^2}} $$\n$$ \\cos\\theta_t = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{0.75}{1.7689}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4239923} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5760077} \\approx 0.7589517 $$\n\nNow, we compute $R_s$ and $R_p$:\n$$ R_s = \\left( \\frac{1 \\cdot (0.5) - 1.33 \\cdot (0.7589517)}{1 \\cdot (0.5) + 1.33 \\cdot (0.7589517)} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{0.5 - 1.0094058}{0.5 + 1.0094058} \\right)^2 $$\n$$ R_s = \\left( \\frac{-0.5094058}{1.5094058} \\right)^2 \\approx (-0.337500)^2 \\approx 0.113906 $$\n$$ R_p = \\left( \\frac{1.33 \\cdot (0.5) - 1 \\cdot (0.7589517)}{1.33 \\cdot (0.5) + 1 \\cdot (0.7589517)} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{0.665 - 0.7589517}{0.665 + 0.7589517} \\right)^2 $$\n$$ R_p = \\left( \\frac{-0.0939517}{1.4239517} \\right)^2 \\approx (-0.065980)^2 \\approx 0.004353 $$\n\nFinally, we compute the specular albedo:\n$$ A_{spec} = \\frac{1}{2} (R_s + R_p) = \\frac{1}{2} (0.113906 + 0.004353) = \\frac{1}{2} (0.118259) \\approx 0.0591295 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the specular albedo is $0.05913$.",

The validation confirms the problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information. We will proceed by first deriving the relationship between channel radiances, then solving for the brightness temperature $T_b$, and finally calculating the numerical value for the brightness temperature departure $T_b - T_s$.\n\nThe analysis is based on the following idealizations provided in the problem statement: a cloud-free, non-emitting, and non-reflecting atmosphere, with negligible downwelling irradiance. The surface is Lambertian with a spectrally constant emissivity $\\epsilon_c$ within a narrow satellite channel centered at wavelength $\\lambda_c$.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Radiance Relation**\n\nThe radiance measured by the satellite sensor in the channel, denoted $L_{\\text{chan}}$, originates solely from the surface emission under the given idealizations. The radiance emitted by a non-blackbody surface is the product of its emissivity and the Planck radiance of a blackbody at the same thermodynamic temperature.\n\nGiven the narrowband approximation, we can represent the channel-integrated radiances by their spectral values at the central wavelength $\\lambda_c$.

Therefore, the measured radiance can also be expressed as:\n$$\nL_{\\text{chan}} = B_{\\lambda}(\\lambda_c, T_b)\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for the channel radiance $L_{\\text{chan}}$, we obtain the narrowband relation between the channel-equivalent Planck radiances evaluated at $T_b$ and $T_s$:\n$$\nB_{\\lambda}(\\lambda_c, T_b) = \\epsilon_c B_{\\lambda}(\\lambda_c, T_s)\n$$\nThis equation states that the radiance sensed by the instrument (interpreted as a blackbody at temperature $T_b$) is the true surface radiance (from a blackbody at $T_s$) scaled by the surface emissivity $\\epsilon_c$.\n\n**Part 2: Explicit Solution for Brightness Temperature $T_b$**\n\nWe now substitute the explicit form of the spectral Planck radiance, $B_{\\lambda}(\\lambda,T) = \\frac{2 h c^2}{\\lambda^5}\\,\\frac{1}{\\exp\\!\\Big(\\frac{h c}{\\lambda k_B T}\\Big) - 1}$, into the relationship derived above.\n\n$$\n\\frac{2 h c^2}{\\lambda_c^5}\\,\\frac{1}{\\exp\\!\\Big(\\frac{h c}{\\lambda_c k_B T_b}\\Big) - 1} = \\epsilon_c \\left( \\frac{2 h c^2}{\\lambda_c^5}\\,\\frac{1}{\\exp\\!\\Big(\\frac{h c}{\\lambda_c k_B T_s}\\Big) - 1} \\right)\n$$\nThe constant pre-factor $\\frac{2 h c^2}{\\lambda_c^5}$ cancels from both sides, yielding:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\exp\\!\\Big(\\frac{h c}{\\lambda_c k_B T_b}\\Big) - 1} = \\frac{\\epsilon_c}{\\exp\\!\\Big(\\frac{h c}{\\lambda_c k_B T_s}\\Big) - 1}\n$$\nWe rearrange this equation to solve for $T_b$.

The true net shortwave flux is therefore:\n$$SW_{net,true} = S_{\\downarrow,tot} - SW_{\\uparrow,true} = (S_{\\downarrow,dir} + S_{\\downarrow,dif}) - (S_{\\downarrow,dir}\\,\\alpha_{bs}(\\theta_{s}) + S_{\\downarrow,dif}\\,\\alpha_{ws})$$\n\nThe approximated reflected shortwave flux, $SW_{\\uparrow,wrong}$, incorrectly applies the white-sky albedo to the total downward irradiance:\n$$SW_{\\uparrow,wrong} = S_{\\downarrow,tot}\\,\\alpha_{ws} = (S_{\\downarrow,dir} + S_{\\downarrow,dif})\\,\\alpha_{ws}$$\nThe approximated net shortwave flux is:\n$$SW_{net,wrong} = S_{\\downarrow,tot} - SW_{\\uparrow,wrong} = (S_{\\downarrow,dir} + S_{\\downarrow,dif}) - (S_{\\downarrow,dir} + S_{\\downarrow,dif})\\,\\alpha_{ws}$$\n\nThe bias $\\Delta SW_{net}$ is the difference between these two net flux formulations:\n$$\\Delta SW_{net} = SW_{net,wrong} - SW_{net,true}$$\n$$\\Delta SW_{net} = \\left[ (S_{\\downarrow,dir} + S_{\\downarrow,dif}) - (S_{\\downarrow,dir} + S_{\\downarrow,dif})\\,\\alpha_{ws} \\right] - \\left[ (S_{\\downarrow,dir} + S_{\\downarrow,dif}) - (S_{\\downarrow,dir}\\,\\alpha_{bs}(\\theta_{s}) + S_{\\downarrow,dif}\\,\\alpha_{ws}) \\right]$$\nSimplifying this expression by distributing the negative sign and canceling terms yields:\n$$\\Delta SW_{net} = - (S_{\\downarrow,dir} + S_{\\downarrow,dif})\\,\\alpha_{ws} + S_{\\downarrow,dir}\\,\\alpha_{bs}(\\theta_{s}) + S_{\\downarrow,dif}\\,\\alpha_{ws}$$\n$$\\Delta SW_{net} = S_{\\downarrow,dir}\\,\\alpha_{bs}(\\theta_{s}) - S_{\\downarrow,dir}\\,\\alpha_{ws} = S_{\\downarrow,dir} \\left( \\alpha_{bs}(\\theta_{s}) - \\alpha_{ws} \\right)$$\nTo compute this bias, we must first derive the analytical expressions for $\\alpha_{bs}(\\theta_{s})$ and $\\alpha_{ws}$ from the given Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF):\n$$f_{r}(\\theta_{i},\\theta_{v}) = \\frac{\\rho_{L}}{\\pi} + \\frac{k}{\\pi}\\,\\mu_{i}\\,\\mu_{v}$$\nwhere $\\mu_{i} = \\cos\\theta_{i}$ and $\\mu_{v} = \\cos\\theta_{v}$.\n\nThe black-sky albedo, $\\alpha_{bs}(\\theta_{s})$, is the hemispheric integral of the BRDF weighted by the cosine of the viewing angle, for a fixed incident direction $\\theta_s$:\n$$\\alpha_{bs}(\\theta_{s}) = \\int_{\\Omega^{+}} f_{r}(\\theta_{s},\\theta_{v})\\,\\mu_{v}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Omega_{v}$$\nUsing spherical coordinates for the viewing hemisphere, $\\mathrm{d}\\Omega_{v} = \\sin\\theta_{v}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta_{v}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\phi_{v}$. Since the BRDF is azimuthally symmetric, the integration over azimuth $\\phi_v$ from $0$ to $2\\pi$ yields a factor of $2\\pi$. Letting $\\mu_v = \\cos\\theta_v$, we have $\\mathrm{d}\\mu_v = -\\sin\\theta_v \\mathrm{d}\\theta_v$, and the integration over $\\theta_v$ from $0$ to $\\pi/2$ becomes an integration over $\\mu_v$ from $1$ to $0$:\n$$\\alpha_{bs}(\\theta_{s}) = 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{1} \\left( \\frac{\\rho_{L}}{\\pi} + \\frac{k}{\\pi}\\,\\mu_{s}\\,\\mu_{v} \\right)\\,\\mu_{v}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu_{v}$$\nwhere $\\mu_s = \\cos\\theta_s$. Evaluating the integral:\n$$\\alpha_{bs}(\\theta_{s}) = 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{1} \\left( \\frac{\\rho_{L}}{\\pi}\\mu_{v} + \\frac{k}{\\pi}\\,\\mu_{s}\\,\\mu_{v}^{2} \\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu_{v} = 2\\pi \\left[ \\frac{\\rho_{L}}{2\\pi}\\mu_{v}^{2} + \\frac{k\\mu_{s}}{3\\pi}\\mu_{v}^{3} \\right]_{0}^{1} = 2\\pi \\left( \\frac{\\rho_{L}}{2\\pi} + \\frac{k\\mu_{s}}{3\\pi} \\right)$$\n$$\\alpha_{bs}(\\theta_{s}) = \\rho_{L} + \\frac{2}{3}k\\mu_{s}$$\n\nThe white-sky albedo, $\\alpha_{ws}$, involves integration over both incident and viewing hemispheres:\n$$\\alpha_{ws} = \\frac{\\displaystyle \\int_{\\Omega^{+}}\\int_{\\Omega^{+}} f_{r}(\\theta_{i},\\theta_{v})\\,\\mu_{i}\\,\\mu_{v}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Omega_{i}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Omega_{v}}{\\displaystyle \\int_{\\Omega^{+}} \\mu_{i}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Omega_{i}}$$\nThe denominator is the hemispherical cosine integral:\n$$\\int_{\\Omega^{+}} \\mu_{i}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Omega_{i} = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\mathrm{d}\\phi_{i}\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\cos\\theta_{i}\\sin\\theta_{i}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta_{i} = 2\\pi \\left[ \\frac{\\sin^2\\theta_i}{2} \\right]_{0}^{\\pi/2} = \\pi$$\nThe numerator, denoted $N$, is separable due to the form of the BRDF:\n$$N = \\int_{\\Omega^{+}}\\int_{\\Omega^{+}} \\left( \\frac{\\rho_{L}}{\\pi} + \\frac{k}{\\pi}\\,\\mu_{i}\\,\\mu_{v} \\right)\\,\\mu_{i}\\,\\mu_{v}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Omega_{i}\\,\\mathrm{d\\Omega_{v}}$$\n$$N = \\frac{\\rho_{L}}{\\pi} \\left(\\int_{\\Omega^{+}} \\mu_{i}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Omega_{i}\\right) \\left(\\int_{\\Omega^{+}} \\mu_{v}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Omega_{v}\\right) + \\frac{k}{\\pi} \\left(\\int_{\\Omega^{+}} \\mu_{i}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Omega_{i}\\right) \\left(\\int_{\\Omega^{+}} \\mu_{v}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Omega_{v}\\right)$$\nWe require the integral of $\\mu^2$ over the hemisphere:\n$$\\int_{\\Omega^{+}} \\mu^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Omega = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\mathrm{d}\\phi\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\cos^2\\theta\\sin\\theta\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta = 2\\pi \\left[ -\\frac{\\cos^3\\theta}{3} \\right]_{0}^{\\pi/2} = 2\\pi \\left( 0 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$$\nSubstituting the integral values into the expression for $N$:\n$$N = \\frac{\\rho_{L}}{\\pi}(\\pi)(\\pi) + \\frac{k}{\\pi}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\rho_{L}\\pi + \\frac{4\\pi k}{9}$$\nThus, the white-sky albedo is:\n$$\\alpha_{ws} = \\frac{N}{\\pi} = \\frac{\\rho_{L}\\pi + \\frac{4\\pi k}{9}}{\\pi} = \\rho_{L} + \\frac{4}{9}k$$\n\nNow we can write the final expression for the flux bias in terms of the given parameters:\n$$\\Delta SW_{net} = S_{\\downarrow,dir} \\left( \\left(\\rho_{L} + \\frac{2}{3}k\\mu_{s}\\right) - \\left(\\rho_{L} + \\frac{4}{9}k\\right) \\right) = S_{\\downarrow,dir} \\, k \\left( \\frac{2}{3}\\mu_{s} - \\frac{4}{9} \\right)$$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- $\\rho_{L} = 0.18$\n- $k = 0.20$\n- $S_{\\downarrow,dir} = 180\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$\n- $\\theta_{s} = 75^\\circ$\n\nFirst, we compute $\\mu_{s} = \\cos(\\theta_{s})$:\n$$\\mu_{s} = \\cos(75^\\circ) \\approx 0.258819$$\nNow, substitute the numerical values into the expression for $\\Delta SW_{net}$:\n$$\\Delta SW_{net} = 180 \\times 0.20 \\times \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\cos(75^\\circ) - \\frac{4}{9} \\right)$$\n$$\\Delta SW_{net} \\approx 36 \\times \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\times 0.258819 - \\frac{4}{9} \\right)$$\n$$\\Delta SW_{net} \\approx 36 \\times (0.172546 - 0.444444...)$$\n$$\\Delta SW_{net} \\approx 36 \\times (-0.271898...)$$\n$$\\Delta SW_{net} \\approx -9.78834\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\Delta SW_{net} \\approx -9.788\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the approximation, which uses the white-sky albedo for the direct beam, overestimates the total reflected flux. This leads to an underestimation of the net flux absorbed by the surface. This outcome is physically consistent, as for a large solar zenith angle ($\\theta_s = 75^\\circ > \\arccos(2/3)$), the black-sky albedo is less than the white-sky albedo for this BRDF model with $k>0$.",
