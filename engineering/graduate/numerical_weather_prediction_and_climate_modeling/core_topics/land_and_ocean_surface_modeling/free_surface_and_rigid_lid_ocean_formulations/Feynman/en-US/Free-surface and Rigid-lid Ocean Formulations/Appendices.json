It is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. The solution process may proceed.\n\nThe solution begins with the derivation of the dispersion relation for the given system of equations. The system is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = -g\\,\\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial x} \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t} + H\\,\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0 \\quad (2)\n$$\nWe seek plane-wave solutions of the form:\n$$\nu(x, t) = U_0 \\exp[i(kx - \\omega t)]\n$$\n$$\n\\eta(x, t) = \\eta_0 \\exp[i(kx - \\omega t)]\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the wavenumber, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, $U_0$ is the complex amplitude of the velocity, and $\\eta_0$ is the complex amplitude of the surface displacement.\n\nSubstituting these forms into equations $(1)$ and $(2)$ involves taking partial derivatives:\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\rightarrow -i\\omega$\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\rightarrow ik$\n\nApplying these to equation $(1)$:\n$$\n-i\\omega (U_0 \\exp[i(kx - \\omega t)]) = -g (ik) (\\eta_0 \\exp[i(kx - \\omega t)])\n$$\nDividing by the exponential term and $-i$, we obtain a linear algebraic equation relating the amplitudes:\n$$\n\\omega U_0 = gk \\eta_0 \\quad (3)\n$$\n\nApplying the same to equation $(2)$:\n$$\n-i\\omega (\\eta_0 \\exp[i(kx - \\omega t)]) + H (ik) (U_0 \\exp[i(kx - \\omega t)]) = 0\n$$\nDividing by the exponential term and $i$:\n$$\n-\\omega \\eta_0 + Hk U_0 = 0 \\quad (4)\n$$\n\nWe now have a system of two homogeneous linear equations for $U_0$ and $\\eta_0$:\n$$\n\\omega U_0 - gk \\eta_0 = 0\n$$\n$$\nHk U_0 - \\omega \\eta_0 = 0\n$$\nFor a non-trivial solution (where $U_0$ and $\\eta_0$ are not both zero), the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero.\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\omega & -gk \\\\ Hk & -\\omega \\end{pmatrix} = (\\omega)(-\\omega) - (-gk)(Hk) = 0\n$$\n$$\n-\\omega^2 + gHk^2 = 0\n$$\nThis leads to the dispersion relation for these waves:\n$$\n\\omega^2 = gHk^2\n$$\nThe phase speed, $c$, is defined as the ratio of angular frequency to wavenumber, $c = \\omega/k$. From the dispersion relation, we can solve for this ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{\\omega^2}{k^2} = gH \\implies \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{k}\\right)^2 = gH\n$$\nTaking the square root gives the phase speed:\n$$\nc = \\pm \\sqrt{gH}\n$$\nThe phase speed is a magnitude, so we take the positive root. This is the phase speed for external (barotropic) gravity waves:\n$$\nc = \\sqrt{gH}\n$$\nThe waves are non-dispersive, as the phase speed $c$ does not depend on the wavenumber $k$.\n\nNext, we evaluate this speed for the given parameters: $H = 4000\\ \\mathrm{m}$ and $g = 9.81\\ \\mathrm{m\\ s^{-2}}$.\n$$\nc = \\sqrt{(9.81\\ \\mathrm{m\\ s^{-2}}) (4000\\ \\mathrm{m})} = \\sqrt{39240\\ \\mathrm{m^2\\ s^{-2}}}\n$$\n$$\nc \\approx 198.090888\\ \\mathrm{m\\ s^{-1}}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the phase speed is $198.1\\ \\mathrm{m\\ s^{-1}}$.\n\nFinally, we consider the implications for the numerical time-step constraint. The Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition for an explicit numerical scheme for wave propagation dictates that the numerical domain of dependence must contain the physical domain of dependence. For a one-dimensional advection/wave equation, this is expressed as:\n$$\nC_{cfl} = \\frac{c_{max} \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} \\le 1\n$$\nwhere $c_{max}$ is the maximum wave speed in the system, $\\Delta t$ is the time step, and $\\Delta x$ is the grid spacing. This imposes an upper limit on the time step for numerical stability:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\le \\frac{\\Delta x}{c_{max}}\n$$\nIn the free-surface model, the fastest waves are the external gravity waves we have just analyzed. Therefore, $c_{max} = c = \\sqrt{gH} \\approx 198.1\\ \\mathrm{m\\ s^{-1}}$. With a grid spacing of $\\Delta x = 25\\ \\mathrm{km} = 25000\\ \\mathrm{m}$, the maximum allowable time step is:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\le \\frac{25000\\ \\mathrm{m}}{198.1\\ \\mathrm{m\\ s^{-1}}} \\approx 126.2\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThis time step of approximately $2$ minutes is very short for climate simulations, which must run for centuries or millennia, making such models computationally expensive.\n\nIn contrast, a model that employs a rigid-lid approximation enforces $\\eta = \\text{constant}$ or, more typically for dynamics, $\\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t} = 0$. Looking at equation $(2)$, this implies that $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0$, meaning the flow is horizontally non-divergent. This approximation effectively filters out the fast external gravity waves, as their existence is tied to the free-surface displacement $\\eta$.\nWith the external gravity waves removed, the maximum wave speed $c_{max}$ in the model is then determined by other, much slower, wave phenomena. These typically include internal gravity waves (associated with density stratification, with speeds on the order of $1-3\\ \\mathrm{m\\ s^{-1}}$) and planetary Rossby waves (even slower). If the fastest remaining waves have a speed of, for example, $c_{internal} \\approx 3\\ \\mathrm{m\\ s^{-1}}$, the CFL condition becomes:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\le \\frac{25000\\ \\mathrm{m}}{3\\ \\mathrm{m\\ s^{-1}}} \\approx 8333\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThis corresponds to a time step of about $2.3$ hours, which is much larger (a factor of roughly $66$) than the time step allowed in the free-surface model. Consequently, the rigid-lid approximation allows for vastly more efficient long-term integration of ocean models, at the cost of excluding phenomena like tides and tsunamis that depend on free-surface dynamics.",

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of geophysical fluid dynamics and numerical ocean modeling, specifically concerning the architecture of the Bryan–Cox–Semtner (BCS) class of models. The problem is well-posed, objective, and provides all necessary data for the requested calculations and conceptual explanation.\n\nThe first part of the problem requires the deduction of the external gravity-wave phase speed and the computation of the associated Courant number for a hypothetical explicit free-surface model.\n\nThe dynamics of the external mode (barotropic component) are described by the linearized one-dimensional shallow-water equations for a non-rotating fluid of constant depth $H$. The momentum and continuity equations are, respectively:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial t} = -g \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial x}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t} + H \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x} = 0\n$$\nwhere $U(x,t)$ is the depth-averaged horizontal velocity, $\\eta(x,t)$ is the sea surface elevation, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $H$ is the uniform ocean depth.\n\nTo find the wave speed, we combine these two equations into a single wave equation for $\\eta$. We take the time derivative of the continuity equation and the spatial derivative of the momentum equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t} + H \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\eta}{\\partial t^2} + H \\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial t \\partial x} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial t}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(-g \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial x}\\right) \\implies \\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial x \\partial t} = -g \\frac{\\partial^2 \\eta}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nAssuming sufficient smoothness to interchange the order of differentiation, we substitute the second result into the first:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\eta}{\\partial t^2} + H \\left(-g \\frac{\\partial^2 \\eta}{\\partial x^2}\\right) = 0\n$$\nThis rearranges to the standard one-dimensional wave equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\eta}{\\partial t^2} = gH \\frac{\\partial^2 \\eta}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nThis equation describes the propagation of non-dispersive waves with a phase speed $c$ where $c^2 = gH$.

This signifies that an explicit time-stepping scheme for a prognostic free surface using the baroclinic time step $\\Delta t = 1800\\,\\mathrm{s}$ would be severely unstable. The numerical domain of dependence would be much smaller than the physical domain of dependence, leading to uncontrollable growth of numerical errors.\n\nThe BCS architecture circumvents this limitation by employing the **rigid-lid approximation**. This approximation physically assumes the sea surface is a rigid, non-deformable lid, effectively filtering out the fast-propagating external gravity waves. Mathematically, this is imposed by setting the time rate of change of the sea surface elevation to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t} = 0\n$$\nApplying this to the depth-integrated continuity equation, $\\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (H\\mathbf{U}) = 0$ (where $\\mathbf{U}$ is the depth-averaged velocity vector), results in a diagnostic constraint on the depth-integrated transport:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot (H\\mathbf{U}) = 0\n$$\nThis is a statement of non-divergence for the barotropic (depth-integrated) flow. Instead of prognostically updating the free surface $\\eta$ at each time step using a hyperbolic equation, the model must now diagnostically solve for a barotropic flow field that satisfies this non-divergence constraint at every instant.\n\nThis transforms the problem for the barotropic mode from a hyperbolic (wave evolution) problem to an elliptic one. To enforce the non-divergence, one typically introduces a barotropic streamfunction $\\Psi$, such that the transport components are $HU = -\\frac{\\partial \\Psi}{\\partial y}$ and $HV = \\frac{\\partial \\Psi}{\\partial x}$, which automatically satisfies the constraint. Taking the curl of the depth-integrated momentum equations yields a second-order elliptic partial differential equation for $\\Psi$. Alternatively, an elliptic Poisson equation for a surface pressure field (which replaces the role of $g\\eta$) can be derived. This elliptic equation must be solved over the entire model domain at each time step.\n\nWhile computationally expensive, solving this elliptic problem has a critical advantage: it contains no time derivatives, and thus there is no associated CFL time-step limitation. By eliminating the external gravity waves, the rigid-lid model's time step is instead limited by the much slower speeds of internal gravity waves and advective velocities, allowing for the use of a large baroclinic time step such as $\\Delta t = 1800\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nThe elliptic constraint $\\nabla \\cdot (H\\mathbf{U}) = 0$ enforces the **conservation of total ocean volume** (or mass, under the Boussinesq approximation). With no change in surface elevation possible, the total volume of water within the domain is constant. The non-divergence of the transport field guarantees that at any point, the volume of water flowing in balances the volume flowing out, preventing any local accumulation or depletion of mass that would otherwise manifest as a change in sea level.",

The bias is defined as the difference between the sea level change in a compressible (non-Boussinesq) model and a Boussinesq model.\n\nFirst, we analyze the physical processes. The sea level change is composed of two parts:\n$1$. The eustatic component, due to the addition of mass (freshwater) to the ocean column.\n$2$. The steric component, due to the change in density of the existing water, primarily through thermal expansion (haline effects are explicitly excluded).\n\nLet's derive the expression for $\\Delta \\eta$ for each formulation.\n\n**Formulation 1: Free-Surface Model with Boussinesq Approximation**\n\nThe Boussinesq approximation is characterized by treating the fluid as incompressible for the purposes of mass conservation, while retaining density variations in the buoyancy term of the momentum equations (which are not needed for this problem). The continuity equation under the Boussinesq approximation is:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0\n$$\nFor a horizontally homogeneous column, the velocity vector is $\\mathbf{u} = (0, 0, w_v)$, where $w_v$ is the vertical velocity. The continuity equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial w_v}{\\partial z} = 0\n$$\nThis implies that $w_v(z)$ is constant throughout the water column. Given the no-motion condition at the bottom ($z=-H$), we have $w_v(-H) = 0$. Therefore, $w_v(z) = 0$ for the entire column.\n\nThe kinematic boundary condition at the free surface $z=\\eta(t)$ relates the rate of change of the surface height to the vertical fluid velocity at the surface and any external volume fluxes. In this case, there is a freshwater volume flux per unit area, $w$. The condition is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\eta}{dt} = w_v(z=\\eta) + w\n$$\nSubstituting $w_v(\\eta) = 0$, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\eta}{dt} = w\n$$\nThis equation states that in the Boussinesq formulation, the sea level changes only due to the external addition or removal of water volume. The model, by virtue of its \"incompressible volume budget\", does not account for the expansion or contraction of the water column due to temperature changes.\n\nTo find the total sea level change over the interval $\\Delta t$, we integrate this equation. Since $w$ is constant:\n$$\n\\Delta \\eta_{\\text{Bous}} = \\int_{0}^{\\Delta t} w \\, dt = w \\Delta t\n$$\n\n**Formulation 2: Free-Surface Model without Boussinesq Approximation (Compressible Mass Budget)**\n\nThis formulation uses the full mass continuity equation, which accounts for changes in density:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho \\mathbf{u}) = 0\n$$\nFor our one-dimensional column, this becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial (\\rho w_v)}{\\partial z} = 0\n$$\nTo find the vertical velocity $w_v(z)$, we integrate this equation with respect to $z$ from the bottom at $z=-H$ up to an arbitrary height $z$:\n$$\n\\int_{-H}^{z} \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} \\, dz' + \\int_{-H}^{z} \\frac{\\partial (\\rho w_v)}{\\partial z'} \\, dz' = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\int_{-H}^{z} \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} \\, dz' + [\\rho w_v]_{-H}^{z} = 0\n$$\nUsing the bottom boundary condition $w_v(-H)=0$, we get:\n$$\n\\int_{-H}^{z} \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} \\, dz' + \\rho(z) w_v(z) = 0\n$$\nSolving for $w_v(z)$ yields:\n$$\nw_v(z) = -\\frac{1}{\\rho(z)} \\int_{-H}^{z} \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} \\, dz'\n$$\nThe vertical velocity at any level is determined by the integrated rate of density change in the column below it.

The problem provides a linearized equation of state relating density $\\rho$ to temperature $T$:\n$$\n\\rho(T) = \\rho_{0} (1 - \\alpha(T - T_{0}))\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the thermal expansion coefficient. Differentiating with respect to time $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} = -\\rho_{0} \\alpha \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}\n$$\nThe rate of temperature change, $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}$, is determined by the heat budget. The surface heat flux $Q$ is absorbed by the mixed layer of constant thickness $h_m$. The heat added over an infinitesimal time $dt$ to a unit area column is $Q dt$. This heat increases the temperature of the mass of the mixed layer, which is $m_{m} \\approx \\rho_{0} h_{m}$. The heat change is $dQ_{heat} = m_{m} c_p dT = \\rho_{0} h_{m} c_p dT$. Thus, the rate of heating is:\n$$\nQ = \\rho_{0} h_{m} c_{p} \\frac{dT}{dt}\n$$\nSince the mixed-layer temperature is vertically uniform, $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\frac{dT}{dt}$. Solving for the rate of temperature change:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\frac{Q}{\\rho_{0} h_{m} c_{p}}\n$$\nNow substitute this into the expression for $\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} = -\\rho_{0} \\alpha \\left( \\frac{Q}{\\rho_{0} h_{m} c_{p}} \\right) = -\\frac{\\alpha Q}{h_{m} c_{p}}\n$$\nThis rate of density change is constant within the mixed layer (from $z=\\eta-h_m$ to $z=\\eta$) and is zero below it, as no heat penetrates below the mixed layer.\nWe can now evaluate the integral in the expression for $\\frac{d\\eta}{dt}$:\n$$\n\\int_{-H}^{\\eta} \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} \\, dz = \\int_{\\eta - h_m}^{\\eta} \\left( -\\frac{\\alpha Q}{h_{m} c_{p}} \\right) dz = -\\frac{\\alpha Q}{h_{m} c_{p}} \\cdot [z]_{\\eta - h_m}^{\\eta} = -\\frac{\\alpha Q}{h_{m} c_{p}} (h_m) = -\\frac{\\alpha Q}{c_{p}}\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the equation for $\\frac{d\\eta}{dt}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\eta}{dt} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho(\\eta)} \\left( -\\frac{\\alpha Q}{c_{p}} \\right) + w = \\frac{\\alpha Q}{\\rho(\\eta) c_{p}} + w\n$$\nUsing the approximation $\\rho(\\eta) \\approx \\rho_{0}$ for the denominator, which is consistent with the level of approximation used throughout:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\eta}{dt} = \\frac{\\alpha Q}{\\rho_{0} c_{p}} + w\n$$\nThe total sea level change for the compressible model, $\\Delta \\eta_{\\text{Comp}}$, is found by integrating over the interval $\\Delta t$. Since all terms on the right-hand side are constant:\n$$\n\\Delta \\eta_{\\text{Comp}} = \\int_{0}^{\\Delta t} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha Q}{\\rho_{0} c_{p}} + w \\right) dt = \\left( \\frac{\\alpha Q}{\\rho_{0} c_{p}} + w \\right) \\Delta t\n$$\nThis expression correctly includes both the thermosteric sea level rise ($\\frac{\\alpha Q \\Delta t}{\\rho_0 c_p}$) and the eustatic sea level rise ($w \\Delta t$).\n\n**Bias Calculation**\n\nThe bias is defined as the difference between the compressible and Boussinesq sea level changes:\n$$\n\\text{Bias} = \\Delta \\eta_{\\text{Comp}} - \\Delta \\eta_{\\text{Bous}}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Bias} = \\left( \\frac{\\alpha Q}{\\rho_{0} c_{p}} + w \\right) \\Delta t - w \\Delta t\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Bias} = \\frac{\\alpha Q \\Delta t}{\\rho_{0} c_{p}}\n$$\nThe bias is precisely the thermosteric component of sea level rise, which the Boussinesq model's volume budget neglects.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe are given the following parameter values:\n- $\\alpha = 2.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}}$\n- $Q = 100\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}} = 100\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s^{-1}\\,m^{-2}}$\n- $\\rho_{0} = 1028\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$\n- $c_{p} = 3990\\,\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n- $\\Delta t = 20\\,\\mathrm{days}$\n\nFirst, we must ensure all units are in the SI system. The time interval $\\Delta t$ must be converted from days to seconds:\n$$\n\\Delta t = 20\\,\\mathrm{days} \\times 24\\,\\mathrm{hours/day} \\times 3600\\,\\mathrm{s/hour} = 1,728,000\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nNow, substitute the values into the bias formula:\n$$\n\\text{Bias} = \\frac{(2.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}}) \\times (100\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s^{-1}\\,m^{-2}}) \\times (1,728,000\\,\\mathrm{s})}{(1028\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}) \\times (3990\\,\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}})}\n$$\nLet's compute the numerator and denominator separately.\nNumerator:\n$$\n2.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\times 100 \\times 1,728,000 = 0.02 \\times 1,728,000 = 34,560\\,\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-2}}\n$$\nDenominator:\n$$\n1028 \\times 3990 = 4,101,720\\,\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-3}\\,K^{-1}}\n$$\nNow, the bias is:\n$$\n\\text{Bias} = \\frac{34,560}{4,101,720}\\,\\mathrm{m} \\approx 0.00842571\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\text{Bias} \\approx 0.008426\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe unit consistency check is:\n$\\frac{[\\mathrm{K^{-1}}] [\\mathrm{J\\,s^{-1}\\,m^{-2}}] [\\mathrm{s}]}{[\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}] [\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}]} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-2}}]}{[\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-3}}]} = \\mathrm{m}$. The units are correct.\nThe values for $h_m$ and $w$ were necessary for the derivation but do not appear in the final expression for the bias.",
