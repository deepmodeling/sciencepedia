            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an expression for the friction velocity, $u_{*}$, under neutral atmospheric conditions, followed by a numerical calculation for a specific case. The derivation must start from the fundamentals of first-order turbulence closure and the mixing-length hypothesis.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Friction Velocity Expression**\n\nIn the atmospheric surface layer, the turbulent shear stress, $\\tau$, which represents the vertical flux of horizontal momentum, is often modeled using a first-order closure scheme (also known as K-theory). For the $x$-component of momentum, the stress $\\tau_{xz}$ is proportional to the mean velocity gradient $\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z}$:\n$$ \\tau_{xz} = \\rho K_m \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z} $$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the air density and $K_m$ is the eddy viscosity for momentum.\n\nThe friction velocity, $u_{*}$, is defined in terms of the surface shear stress, $\\tau_0$:\n$$ u_{*}^2 = \\frac{\\tau_0}{\\rho} $$\nIn the surface layer, it is assumed that the stress is approximately constant with height and equal to the surface stress, so $\\tau_{xz} \\approx \\tau_0$. Combining these two equations gives:\n$$ u_{*}^2 = K_m \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z} $$\n\nThe mixing-length hypothesis, as proposed by Prandtl, provides an expression for the eddy viscosity $K_m$. It relates $K_m$ to a characteristic length scale of turbulence, the mixing length $l_m$, and the local velocity shear:\n$$ K_m = l_m^2 \\left| \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z} \\right| $$\nUnder neutral stratification, Monin-Obukhov similarity theory dictates that the mixing length is a linear function of the effective height above the ground. The effective height is the measurement height $z$ minus the zero-plane displacement height $d$. Thus, the mixing length is given by:\n$$ l_m = \\kappa (z - d) $$\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the von Kármán constant.\n\nSubstituting the mixing-length expression for $K_m$ into the equation for $u_{*}^2$:\n$$ u_{*}^2 = \\left( [\\kappa(z-d)]^2 \\left| \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z} \\right| \\right) \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z} $$\nAssuming the wind speed increases with height, the wind shear $\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z}$ is positive, so its absolute value is unchanged. The equation simplifies to:\n$$ u_{*}^2 = [\\kappa(z-d)]^2 \\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z}\\right)^2 $$\nTaking the square root of both sides (and noting that $u_{*}$, $\\kappa$, $(z-d)$, and $\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z}$ are all non-negative), we obtain:\n$$ u_{*} = \\kappa(z-d) \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z} $$\nThis can be rearranged into a differential equation for the mean wind speed $U(z)$:\n$$ \\frac{dU}{dz} = \\frac{u_{*}}{\\kappa(z-d)} $$\n\nTo find the wind profile $U(z)$, we integrate this differential equation. The boundary condition is that the wind speed is zero ($U=0$) at a height $z_0$ above the displacement plane, i.e., at $z = d + z_0$. The height $z_0$ is the aerodynamic roughness length.\n$$ \\int_{0}^{U(z)} dU' = \\int_{d+z_0}^{z} \\frac{u_{*}}{\\kappa(z'-d)} dz' $$\nSince $u_{*}$ and $\\kappa$ are constants with respect to height in this model:\n$$ U(z) = \\frac{u_{*}}{\\kappa} \\int_{d+z_0}^{z} \\frac{1}{z'-d} dz' $$\nThe integral of $\\frac{1}{z'-d}$ with respect to $z'$ is $\\ln(z'-d)$. Evaluating the definite integral:\n$$ U(z) = \\frac{u_{*}}{\\kappa} \\left[ \\ln(z'-d) \\right]_{d+z_0}^{z} $$\n$$ U(z) = \\frac{u_{*}}{\\kappa} \\left( \\ln(z-d) - \\ln((d+z_0)-d) \\right) $$\n$$ U(z) = \\frac{u_{*}}{\\kappa} \\left( \\ln(z-d) - \\ln(z_0) \\right) $$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we arrive at the logarithmic wind profile for neutral conditions:\n$$ U(z) = \\frac{u_{*}}{\\kappa} \\ln\\left(\\frac{z-d}{z_0}\\right) $$\nThe problem asks for an explicit expression for $u_{*}$. Rearranging this equation gives the desired result:\n$$ u_{*} = \\frac{\\kappa U(z)}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{z-d}{z_0}\\right)} $$\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are given the following values for a neutrally stratified marine surface layer:\n- Mean wind speed $U = 5\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$ at height $z = 10\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n- von Kármán constant $\\kappa = 0.40$.\n- Roughness length $z_{0} = 2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n- Displacement height $d = 0\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived expression for $u_{*}$:\n$$ u_{*} = \\frac{(0.40) \\times (5\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}})}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{m} - 0\\,\\mathrm{m}}{2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}}\\right)} $$\n$$ u_{*} = \\frac{2.0}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{10}{0.002}\\right)}\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}} $$\n$$ u_{*} = \\frac{2.0}{\\ln(5000)}\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}} $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$ \\ln(5000) \\approx 8.517193 $$\n$$ u_{*} \\approx \\frac{2.0}{8.517193}\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}} $$\n$$ u_{*} \\approx 0.234816\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures.\n$$ u_{*} \\approx 0.235\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}} $$\nThe calculated friction velocity is $0.235\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$.",

All provided data and definitions are consistent and sufficient for deriving a unique and meaningful solution. Therefore, a full solution is warranted.\n\nThe derivation begins with the fundamental definitions for the turbulent momentum flux, $\\tau$, in the atmospheric surface layer. Two equivalent expressions are given: one based on the friction velocity, $u_{\\ast}$, and the other based on a bulk aerodynamic formula using the mean wind speed, $U(z)$, at a reference height $z$.\n\nThe first definition relates the flux to the friction velocity:\n$$\n\\tau = \\rho u_{\\ast}^{2}\n$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the air density.\n\nThe second is the bulk aerodynamic parameterization:\n$$\n\\tau = \\rho C_{D}(z)\\,U(z)^{2}\n$$\nwhere $C_{D}(z)$ is the dimensionless drag coefficient at height $z$.\n\nBy equating these two expressions for $\\tau$, we establish a relationship between the fundamental velocity scale $u_{\\ast}$ and the parameterized bulk coefficient $C_{D}(z)$:\n$$\n\\rho u_{\\ast}^{2} = \\rho C_{D}(z)\\,U(z)^{2}\n$$\nThe air density $\\rho$ cancels from both sides, yielding:\n$$\nu_{\\ast}^{2} = C_{D}(z)\\,U(z)^{2}\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to express the drag coefficient $C_{D}(z)$ as a function of $u_{\\ast}$ and $U(z)$:\n$$\nC_{D}(z) = \\left(\\frac{u_{\\ast}}{U(z)}\\right)^{2}\n$$\nThis form shows that the drag coefficient is fundamentally the squared ratio of the friction velocity to the mean wind speed at the reference height. To obtain an expression for $C_{D}(z)$ in terms of the given physical parameters ($\\kappa$, $z$, $z_{0}$), we must relate the ratio $u_{\\ast}/U(z)$ to these parameters.\n\nThe problem states that for neutral stratification, the mean wind profile $U(z)$ follows the logarithmic law:\n$$\nU(z) = \\frac{u_{\\ast}}{\\kappa} \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{z}{z_{0}}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the von Kármán constant and $z_{0}$ is the aerodynamic roughness length. This equation provides the necessary link. We rearrange it to solve for the ratio $u_{\\ast}/U(z)$:\n$$\n\\frac{U(z)}{u_{\\ast}} = \\frac{1}{\\kappa} \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{z}{z_{0}}\\right) \\implies \\frac{u_{\\ast}}{U(z)} = \\frac{\\kappa}{\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{z}{z_{0}}\\right)}\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into our expression for $C_{D}(z)$:\n$$\nC_{D}(z) = \\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{z}{z_{0}}\\right)}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{\\kappa^2}{\\left[\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{z}{z_{0}}\\right)\\right]^2}\n$$\nThis is the required analytic expression for the drag coefficient $C_{D}(z)$ under neutral conditions.\n\nThis expression reveals the sensitivity of $C_{D}(z)$ to the aerodynamic roughness length $z_{0}$. The drag coefficient is inversely proportional to the square of the natural logarithm of the ratio $z/z_{0}$. Since $z$ is a fixed reference height, as the surface roughness $z_{0}$ increases, the argument of the logarithm, $z/z_{0}$, decreases. For $z > z_{0}$, the term $\\ln(z/z_{0})$ is positive and decreases as $z_{0}$ increases. Since this term appears in the denominator of the expression for $C_{D}(z)$, a decrease in its value leads to an increase in $C_{D}(z)$. Therefore, rougher surfaces (larger $z_{0}$) generate more drag (larger $C_{D}(z)$) for a given wind speed, which is physically consistent.\n\nWe are now tasked with computing the ratio $R$ for two different roughness lengths, representing a transition from a smooth to a rough regime. The values are reference height $z=10\\,\\mathrm{m}$, smooth regime roughness $z_{0, \\text{smooth}} = 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, and rough regime roughness $z_{0, \\text{rough}} = 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nThe ratio $R$ is defined as:\n$$\nR \\equiv \\frac{C_{D}(z; z_{0} = 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m})}{C_{D}(z; z_{0} = 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m})}\n$$\nUsing our derived formula for $C_{D}(z)$, we can write the numerator and denominator:\n$$\nC_{D}(z; z_{0} = 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m}) = \\frac{\\kappa^2}{\\left[\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{10}{10^{-2}}\\right)\\right]^2}\n$$\n$$\nC_{D}(z; z_{0} = 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}) = \\frac{\\kappa^2}{\\left[\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{10}{10^{-5}}\\right)\\right]^2}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\frac{\\kappa^2}{\\left[\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{10}{10^{-2}}\\right)\\right]^2}}{\\frac{\\kappa^2}{\\left[\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{10}{10^{-5}}\\right)\\right]^2}}\n$$\nThe von Kármán constant $\\kappa$ cancels out, demonstrating that the ratio is independent of its specific value. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\left[\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{10}{10^{-5}}\\right)\\right]^2}{\\left[\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{10}{10^{-2}}\\right)\\right]^2} = \\left(\\frac{\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{10}{10^{-5}}\\right)}{\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{10}{10^{-2}}\\right)}\\right)^2\n$$\nNow, we evaluate the arguments of the logarithms:\n$$\n\\frac{10}{10^{-5}} = 10 \\times 10^{5} = 10^{6}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{10}{10^{-2}} = 10 \\times 10^{2} = 10^{3}\n$$\nSubstituting these values back into the expression for $R$:\n$$\nR = \\left(\\frac{\\ln(10^6)}{\\ln(10^3)}\\right)^2\n$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(a^b) = b \\ln(a)$:\n$$\nR = \\left(\\frac{6 \\ln(10)}{3 \\ln(10)}\\right)^2\n$$\nThe term $\\ln(10)$ cancels from the numerator and denominator:\n$$\nR = \\left(\\frac{6}{3}\\right)^2 = 2^2 = 4\n$$\nThe exact dimensionless ratio is $4$.

We now consider the evolution of a pre-existing sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly, $T^{\\prime}$. The conservation of energy for the homogeneous mixed layer is expressed as the rate of change of its heat content per unit area being equal to the net surface heat flux. The heat content per unit area is the product of the volumetric heat capacity and the temperature of the layer, integrated over its depth $h$. For a homogeneous layer, this is $\\rho c_p h T$. The time rate of change of heat content anomaly is therefore $\\rho c_p h \\frac{dT^{\\prime}}{dt}$.\n\nThis rate of change is driven by the anomalous net surface heat flux, $F_{\\mathrm{net}}^{\\prime}$. The energy balance equation for the anomaly is:\n$$\\rho c_p h \\frac{dT^{\\prime}}{dt} = F_{\\mathrm{net}}^{\\prime}$$\nThe problem states that the anomalous flux can be approximated by a linear relationship with the SST anomaly:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{net}}^{\\prime} = -\\Lambda T^{\\prime}$$\nwhere $\\Lambda$ is the effective damping parameter. Substituting this into the energy balance equation gives a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for $T^{\\prime}$:\n$$\\rho c_p h \\frac{dT^{\\prime}}{dt} = -\\Lambda T^{\\prime}$$\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n$$\\frac{dT^{\\prime}}{dt} = -\\left(\\frac{\\Lambda}{\\rho c_p h}\\right) T^{\\prime}$$\nThe solution to this differential equation is an exponential decay of the form:\n$$T^{\\prime}(t) = T^{\\prime}(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)$$\nwhere $T^{\\prime}(0)$ is the initial anomaly and $\\tau$ is the e-folding timescale. By comparing the equation with its solution, we identify the e-folding timescale as the inverse of the decay rate coefficient:\n$$\\tau = \\frac{\\rho c_p h}{\\Lambda}$$\nWe are given the following values:\n$\\rho = 1027\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$\n$c_{p} = 3990\\,\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n$h = 50\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$\\Lambda = 40\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\tau$:\n$$\\tau = \\frac{(1027\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}) \\times (3990\\,\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (50\\,\\mathrm{m})}{40\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}}}$$\nFirst, we compute the numerator, which represents the heat capacity of the mixed layer column per unit area:\n$$\\rho c_p h = 1027 \\times 3990 \\times 50 = 204,886,500\\,\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}}$$\nNow, we calculate $\\tau$.
