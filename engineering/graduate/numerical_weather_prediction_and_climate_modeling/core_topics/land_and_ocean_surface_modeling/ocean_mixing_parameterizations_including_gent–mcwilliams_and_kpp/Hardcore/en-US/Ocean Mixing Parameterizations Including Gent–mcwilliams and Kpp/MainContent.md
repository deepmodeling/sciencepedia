## Introduction
In the vast and complex system of the global ocean, many critical processes occur at scales too small to be explicitly resolved by today's climate models. The accurate representation of the ocean's role in the climate system therefore hinges on the ability to parameterize the effects of this unresolved physics. This article addresses this fundamental challenge by focusing on two of the most influential and widely used [ocean mixing](@entry_id:200437) parameterizations: the Gent–McWilliams (GM) scheme for mesoscale eddy transport and the K-Profile Parameterization (KPP) for boundary layer turbulence. Without these, models suffer from unrealistic circulation and a distorted response to climate forcing. This article provides a comprehensive overview designed for graduate-level study.

The first chapter, "Principles and Mechanisms," will deconstruct the core physics behind GM and KPP, differentiating between adiabatic and diabatic processes. Following this, "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" will explore how these theories are put into practice, their numerical challenges, and their profound implications for ocean circulation and heat uptake. Finally, "Hands-On Practices" will provide opportunities to apply these concepts through targeted problems. We begin by examining the physical principles that necessitate these parameterizations and the mechanisms by which they operate.

## Principles and Mechanisms

Having introduced the necessity of parameterizing subgrid-scale processes in ocean models, we now delve into the core principles and specific mechanisms that govern the most widely used of these parameterizations. Our focus will be on distinguishing the physical processes that are parameterized, understanding the theoretical basis for their mathematical formulation, and appreciating their distinct roles in maintaining the large-scale structure and circulation of the simulated ocean.

### The Challenge of Unresolved Eddies and Spurious Mixing

The fundamental challenge for climate-scale ocean models stems from a mismatch of scales. The most energetic motions in the ocean interior are **mesoscale eddies**, which have horizontal scales on the order of the first baroclinic **Rossby radius of deformation**, $L_R$. In mid-latitudes, $L_R$ is typically in the range of 20–50 km. However, global climate models have historically been run at resolutions of approximately $1^{\circ}$ latitude-longitude, which corresponds to a grid spacing $\Delta x$ of about 80 km at 45° latitude. According to the Nyquist-Shannon [sampling theorem](@entry_id:262499), to adequately resolve a phenomenon, the grid spacing must be significantly smaller than the feature's characteristic scale. As $\Delta x \gtrsim L_R$, these coarse-resolution models are, by definition, "non-eddy-resolving" . The crucial transport of heat, salt, and other tracers by these eddies is therefore absent from the explicitly resolved flow.

Left unaddressed, this missing transport has catastrophic consequences for a model's fidelity. The large-scale [wind-driven circulation](@entry_id:1134085) tends to steepen surfaces of constant potential density, known as **isopycnals**. In the real ocean, mesoscale eddies act to release the [available potential energy](@entry_id:1121282) stored in these tilted surfaces by stirring water parcels along them, which leads to a "slumping" or flattening of the isopycnals. In a non-eddy-resolving model, this slumping mechanism is absent, and isopycnals become unrealistically steep.

This leads to a pernicious numerical artifact known as **spurious diapycnal mixing**. Many models employ a simple Laplacian diffusion on their coordinate surfaces (e.g., horizontal diffusion on geopotential $z$-levels) to provide [numerical stability](@entry_id:146550) and represent unresolved small-scale mixing. When a horizontal diffusion operator acts on a steeply tilted isopycnal, a significant component of the [diffusive flux](@entry_id:748422) is directed perpendicular to the isopycnal surface. This cross-isopycnal flux is unphysical; it represents a mixing of water masses of different densities that is not justified by any physical process and which is far larger than what is observed in the real ocean. This spurious mixing fatally erodes the model's thermocline, weakens stratification, and distorts the global heat and freshwater budgets  . Other numerical choices, such as the use of "staircase" topography to represent sloped bottoms and the implicit numerical diffusion present in many tracer [advection schemes](@entry_id:1120842), also contribute to [spurious diapycnal mixing](@entry_id:1132228) . The central task of modern mixing parameterizations is to represent the missing physical eddy transport while mitigating these spurious numerical effects.

### Adiabatic versus Diabatic Processes: A Tale of Two Mixings

To correctly parameterize subgrid-scale transport, we must first distinguish between two fundamentally different types of processes: those that occur *along* isopycnal surfaces and those that occur *across* them.

A process is termed **adiabatic** or **isoneutral** if it does not change the potential density of a fluid parcel. This includes advection and stirring along an isopycnal surface. These processes redistribute tracers and release available potential energy, but they do not transform a water mass from one density class to another. The eddy-induced slumping of isopycnals is the primary example of an adiabatic process that must be parameterized.

Conversely, a process is termed **diabatic** or **diapycnal** if it changes a parcel's potential density. This involves mixing across isopycnal surfaces. Diabatic processes are responsible for genuine **water mass transformation**—the creation or destruction of water of a particular density class. Examples include turbulent mixing driven by breaking internal waves in the ocean interior and intense mixing in the surface boundary layer due to wind and buoyancy fluxes.

This distinction is crucial. Mathematically, any subgrid tracer flux $\boldsymbol{J}_c$ can be decomposed into a component tangent to the local neutral surface and a component normal to it. Letting $\hat{\boldsymbol{m}}$ be the unit vector normal to the neutral surface, the isoneutral flux has no component along $\hat{\boldsymbol{m}}$, while the diapycnal flux is entirely directed along $\hat{\boldsymbol{m}}$ .

While diapycnal mixing is essential for closing the global Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC)—it is the process that allows deep, dense water to be slowly warmed and returned to the surface—its average magnitude in the ocean interior must be very small. A simple [scaling argument](@entry_id:271998) based on the observed MOC transport of $\sim 10$ Sverdrups ($10^7$ m$^3$s$^{-1}$) over the global ocean area suggests that the required area-averaged interior diapycnal diffusivity, $\kappa_v$, is only on the order of $10^{-5}$ m$^2$s$^{-1}$ . If interior [diapycnal mixing](@entry_id:1123661) were much larger, the thermocline would be destroyed. Therefore, we cannot simply remedy the problem of unresolved eddies by increasing vertical mixing; doing so would substitute one error for another. The effects of eddies must be parameterized as an almost purely adiabatic process.

### Parameterizing Adiabatic Eddy Effects: The Gent–McWilliams/Redi Framework

The modern approach to parameterizing the adiabatic effects of mesoscale eddies is a coupled framework often referred to as the Gent–McWilliams/Redi scheme. It is designed explicitly to mimic the action of baroclinic instability, the process that gives rise to most mesoscale eddies.

#### The Reynolds-Averaged Budget and Flux Decomposition

The starting point for any parameterization is the **Reynolds-averaged tracer budget**. If we decompose the velocity $\boldsymbol{u}$ and tracer concentration $C$ into a resolved mean (e.g., $\overline{\boldsymbol{u}}$) and an unresolved eddy fluctuation (e.g., $\boldsymbol{u}'$), the exact equation for the evolution of the mean tracer becomes:
$$
\frac{\partial \overline{C}}{\partial t} + \overline{\boldsymbol{u}} \cdot \nabla \overline{C} = -\nabla \cdot (\overline{\boldsymbol{u}' C'}) + \overline{S}
$$
Here, the term $\overline{\boldsymbol{u}} \cdot \nabla \overline{C}$ represents **resolved advection** by the grid-scale flow. The term $-\nabla \cdot (\overline{\boldsymbol{u}' C'})$ is the divergence of the **eddy correlation flux**, which represents the net effect of all unresolved [transport processes](@entry_id:177992). The goal of parameterization is to find a "closure" for $\overline{\boldsymbol{u}' C'}$ in terms of resolved-scale quantities .

A key insight is that the subgrid flux tensor can be decomposed into symmetric and skew-symmetric parts. The symmetric part corresponds to diffusive processes that dissipate tracer variance, while the skew-symmetric part corresponds to advective processes that rearrange tracers without dissipation . This mathematical decomposition neatly maps onto two distinct physical effects of eddies: stirring and advection.

#### Redi Isoneutral Diffusion: The Symmetric Component

The **Redi parameterization** addresses the diffusive component of eddy stirring. It models eddy transport as a Fickian diffusion that acts exclusively along neutral surfaces. This is achieved by constructing a diffusion tensor $\mathbf{K}$ that projects the tracer gradient onto the local neutral surface before acting upon it. The [diffusive flux](@entry_id:748422) is $\boldsymbol{J} = -\mathbf{K}\nabla C$, where the Redi tensor $\mathbf{K}$ is given by:
$$
\mathbf{K} = K_I (\mathbf{I} - \hat{\boldsymbol{n}}\hat{\boldsymbol{n}}^{\mathsf{T}})
$$
Here, $K_I$ is the isoneutral diffusivity, $\mathbf{I}$ is the identity tensor, and $\hat{\boldsymbol{n}}$ is the [unit vector](@entry_id:150575) normal to the neutral surface. This tensor is symmetric and positive semidefinite, ensuring that it represents a dissipative process that mixes tracers *along*, not across, neutral surfaces  .

In a $z$-coordinate model, where the local orientation of the neutral surface is given by the **isoneutral slope vector** $\boldsymbol{s}=(s_x, s_y)$, the components of this tensor can be written out explicitly. For example, the vertical component of the diffusivity becomes $K_{zz} = K_I \frac{s_x^2+s_y^2}{1+s_x^2+s_y^2}$, and off-diagonal, cross-term diffusivities like $K_{xz} = K_I \frac{s_x}{1+s_x^2+s_y^2}$ appear, which are crucial for rotating the diffusive flux to lie along the tilted neutral surface .

#### Gent–McWilliams Eddy-Induced Advection: The Skew-Symmetric Component

The **Gent–McWilliams (GM) parameterization** addresses the advective component of eddy transport. It represents the collective effect of eddies slumping down the mean isopycnal slope, releasing available potential energy . This process is parameterized as an additional advection by an **[eddy-induced velocity](@entry_id:1124135)**, often called the **bolus velocity**, $\boldsymbol{u}^*$. The tracer budget then includes an extra term, $-\boldsymbol{u}^* \cdot \nabla \overline{C}$.

The bolus velocity $\boldsymbol{u}^*$ is constructed to be adiabatic (tangent to isopycnals) and non-divergent. Its magnitude is proportional to the isopycnal slope, $\boldsymbol{s}$, and an eddy diffusivity coefficient, $\kappa_{GM}$. This formulation is mathematically equivalent to the skew-symmetric part of the eddy flux tensor and to a downgradient diffusion of isopycnal layer thickness  . The key physical consequence is that GM systematically flattens the model's isopycnal slopes, bringing them closer to reality and mitigating the spurious diapycnal mixing that arises from misaligned diffusion operators .

The strength of the GM parameterization, $\kappa_{GM}$, is physically scaled based on the theory of baroclinic instability. Its magnitude is parameterized to depend on local properties of the flow, such as the stratification $N$ and the [vertical shear](@entry_id:1133795) of the mean flow $|\partial U / \partial z|$, reflecting that factors like stronger shear or weaker stratification can fuel more vigorous eddy activity .

A final, advanced point is that neutral surfaces are not, in fact, globally integrable due to the nonlinear and pressure-dependent nature of seawater's equation of state (effects known as **[thermobaricity](@entry_id:1133045)** and **[cabbeling](@entry_id:1121979)**). This means that schemes like Redi and GM must construct their rotated tensors based on purely local information about the neutral direction. This leads to numerical challenges, such as singularities where neutral surfaces become vertical, which are handled in models by applying **[slope limiting](@entry_id:754953)** or tapering .

### Parameterizing Diabatic Processes: The K-Profile Parameterization (KPP)

While the Gent–McWilliams/Redi framework addresses the adiabatic transport in the ocean interior, a separate class of diabatic processes dominates the oceanic boundary layers. The **K-Profile Parameterization (KPP)** is a sophisticated scheme designed to represent vertical turbulent mixing in the oceanic surface and bottom boundary layers, driven by direct forcing from the atmosphere and interaction with topography .

The KPP framework is built on several key principles  :

1.  **Flux Decomposition:** KPP acknowledges that turbulence in the boundary layer is not purely a local, downgradient process. Especially under destabilizing conditions (e.g., surface cooling), large, coherent convective plumes can transport heat and other properties deep into the boundary layer, sometimes against the local mean gradient. KPP represents the total vertical [turbulent flux](@entry_id:1133512) $\overline{w'\phi'}$ as the sum of a standard downgradient [diffusive flux](@entry_id:748422) and a **nonlocal transport term**, $\mathcal{G}_\phi$. This nonlocal term is crucial for realistically simulating convective mixing.

2.  **The "K-Profile":** The vertical eddy diffusivity, $K_\phi(z)$, is not constant but follows a specific parabolic shape—the "K-profile". This profile is constructed from physical [scaling arguments](@entry_id:273307). It is the product of a velocity scale (derived from surface [friction velocity](@entry_id:267882) $u_*$ and convective velocity $w_*$), a length scale (the boundary layer depth $h$), and a dimensionless shape function. This shape function ensures that the diffusivity is zero at the ocean surface and smoothly matches the weak interior mixing at the base of the boundary layer, peaking in between.

3.  **Dynamic Boundary Layer Depth:** The boundary layer depth, $h$, is not prescribed but is diagnosed at each time step. KPP calculates $h$ as the depth where a bulk **Richardson number**—a ratio of the stabilizing effect of stratification to the destabilizing effect of velocity shear—reaches a critical value (typically $\approx 0.3$). This allows the model to simulate the diurnal and seasonal cycles of mixed-layer deepening and shoaling.

In conclusion, a realistic ocean climate model requires a suite of mixing parameterizations that respect the fundamental physical distinction between adiabatic and diabatic processes. The Gent–McWilliams and Redi schemes work in tandem to represent the adiabatic slumping and stirring effects of unresolved [mesoscale eddies](@entry_id:1127814) in the ocean interior, which is crucial for maintaining realistic isopycnal slopes and preventing spurious numerical mixing. The K-Profile Parameterization complements this by representing the strong, diabatic vertical mixing within the dynamically active boundary layers, which is essential for water mass formation and [air-sea interaction](@entry_id:1120897). Both are indispensable components of the modern ocean modeler's toolkit.
