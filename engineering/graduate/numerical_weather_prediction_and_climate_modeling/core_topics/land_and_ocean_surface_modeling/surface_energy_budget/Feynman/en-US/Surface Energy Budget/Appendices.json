            "solution": "The net all-wave radiation at the surface, $R_n$, is defined as the sum of all downward radiative fluxes minus the sum of all upward radiative fluxes. The sign convention specifies downward fluxes as positive. The total fluxes are composed of shortwave (solar) and longwave (thermal infrared) components. Let $S$ denote shortwave irradiance and $L$ denote longwave irradiance. The superscripts $\\downarrow$ and $\\uparrow$ indicate downward and upward fluxes, respectively.\n\nFollowing the problem's definition (i), the net radiation is:\n$$\nR_n = (S^{\\downarrow} + L^{\\downarrow}) - (S^{\\uparrow} + L^{\\uparrow})\n$$\nOur task is to derive expressions for the upward fluxes, $S^{\\uparrow}$ and $L^{\\uparrow}$, based on the provided principles and properties.\n\nFirst, we consider the shortwave radiation balance. The upward shortwave flux, $S^{\\uparrow}$, is the portion of the downwelling shortwave irradiance, $S^{\\downarrow}$, that is reflected by the surface. The problem states that shortwave reflectance is characterized by the albedo, $\\alpha$. Therefore:\n$$\nS^{\\uparrow} = \\alpha S^{\\downarrow}\n$$\n\nNext, we consider the longwave radiation balance. The upward longwave flux, $L^{\\uparrow}$, is the sum of two components: the radiation emitted by the surface itself, and the portion of the downwelling longwave radiation, $L^{\\downarrow}$, that is reflected by the surface.\n\n$1$. The emitted longwave radiation is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law (definition ii). For a perfect blackbody, the emitted hemispheric flux is $\\sigma T^{4}$. The surface is described as a gray body with a thermal infrared emissivity of $\\epsilon$. The emitted flux is therefore scaled by the emissivity:\n$$\nL^{\\uparrow}_{\\text{emitted}} = \\epsilon \\sigma T_s^4\n$$\nwhere $T_s$ is the skin temperature of the surface.\n\n$2$. The reflected longwave radiation depends on the surface's longwave reflectivity, $\\rho_L$. The problem states the surface is opaque in the thermal infrared, meaning its longwave transmittance, $\\tau_L$, is zero ($\\tau_L = 0$). For any surface, the sum of reflectivity ($\\rho_L$), absorptivity ($\\alpha_L$), and transmissivity ($\\tau_L$) must equal $1$.\n$$\n\\rho_L + \\alpha_L + \\tau_L = 1\n$$\nFor an opaque surface, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\rho_L + \\alpha_L = 1 \\implies \\rho_L = 1 - \\alpha_L\n$$\nThe problem invokes Kirchhoff’s law for an opaque gray surface (definition iii), which states that the hemispheric emissivity equals the absorptivity in the thermal infrared spectrum: $\\epsilon = \\alpha_L$. Substituting this into the previous equation gives the longwave reflectivity in terms of emissivity:\n$$\n\\rho_L = 1 - \\epsilon\n$$\nThe reflected portion of the downwelling longwave radiation is thus:\n$$\nL^{\\uparrow}_{\\text{reflected}} = \\rho_L L^{\\downarrow} = (1 - \\epsilon) L^{\\downarrow}\n$$\n\nThe total upward longwave flux is the sum of the emitted and reflected components:\n$$\nL^{\\uparrow} = L^{\\uparrow}_{\\text{emitted}} + L^{\\uparrow}_{\\text{reflected}} = \\epsilon \\sigma T_s^4 + (1 - \\epsilon) L^{\\downarrow}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $S^{\\uparrow}$ and $L^{\\uparrow}$ back into the original equation for the net radiation, $R_n$:\n$$\nR_n = (S^{\\downarrow} + L^{\\downarrow}) - (\\alpha S^{\\downarrow} + [\\epsilon \\sigma T_s^4 + (1 - \\epsilon) L^{\\downarrow}])\n$$\nDistributing the negative sign and simplifying the expression:\n$$\nR_n = S^{\\downarrow} + L^{\\downarrow} - \\alpha S^{\\downarrow} - \\epsilon \\sigma T_s^4 - (1 - \\epsilon) L^{\\downarrow}\n$$\n$$\nR_n = S^{\\downarrow} - \\alpha S^{\\downarrow} + L^{\\downarrow} - L^{\\downarrow} + \\epsilon L^{\\downarrow} - \\epsilon \\sigma T_s^4\n$$\n$$\nR_n = (1 - \\alpha) S^{\\downarrow} + \\epsilon L^{\\downarrow} - \\epsilon \\sigma T_s^4\n$$\nThis expression can be factored to yield the final derived form for the net all-wave radiation:\n$$\nR_n = (1 - \\alpha)S^{\\downarrow} + \\epsilon(L^{\\downarrow} - \\sigma T_s^4)\n$$\nThis final expression represents the net absorbed shortwave radiation, $(1 - \\alpha)S^{\\downarrow}$, plus the net longwave radiation, $\\epsilon(L^{\\downarrow} - \\sigma T_s^4)$.\n\nWe now evaluate this expression numerically using the provided data:\n- Shortwave albedo $\\alpha = 0.25$\n- Thermal infrared emissivity $\\epsilon = 0.97$\n- Skin temperature $T_s = 305\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n- Downwelling shortwave irradiance $S^{\\downarrow} = 800\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$\n- Downwelling longwave irradiance $L^{\\downarrow} = 420\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$\n- Stefan-Boltzmann constant $\\sigma = 5.670374419 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-4}}$\n\nFirst, calculate the blackbody emission term, $\\sigma T_s^4$:\n$$\n\\sigma T_s^4 = (5.670374419 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-4}}) \\times (305\\ \\mathrm{K})^4\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma T_s^4 = (5.670374419 \\times 10^{-8}) \\times (8653650625)\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma T_s^4 \\approx 490.69905\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}\n$$\nNow substitute all values into the expression for $R_n$:\n$$\nR_n = (1 - 0.25) \\times 800\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}} + 0.97 \\times (420\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}} - 490.69905\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}})\n$$\n$$\nR_n = (0.75) \\times 800\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}} + 0.97 \\times (-70.69905\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}})\n$$\n$$\nR_n = 600\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}} - 68.57808\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}\n$$\n$$\nR_n = 531.42192\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}\n$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.

            "solution": "The problem asks for a derivation of the partitioning of the turbulent vertical flux of moist enthalpy and the subsequent calculation of the sensible and latent heat fluxes from provided micrometeorological data.\n\nFirst, we begin with the definition of moist specific enthalpy, $h$, which represents the total energy content (thermal and latent) per unit mass of moist air. Under the assumption that the specific heat capacities are constant, a common and effective approximation for $h$ is given by:\n$$h = c_p T + L_v q$$\nwhere $T$ is the air temperature, $q$ is the specific humidity, $c_p$ is the specific heat capacity of air at constant pressure, and $L_v$ is the latent heat of vaporization of water.\n\nThe vertical turbulent flux of moist enthalpy, $F_h$, is defined as the covariance of the vertical wind velocity, $w$, and the moist specific enthalpy, $h$, multiplied by the air density, $\\rho$.\n$$F_h = \\rho \\overline{wh}$$\nWe apply Reynolds decomposition to the variables $w$, $T$, and $q$. Each variable is split into a mean component (denoted by an overbar) and a turbulent fluctuation from the mean (denoted by a prime):\n$$w = \\bar{w} + w'$$\n$$T = \\bar{T} + T'$$\n$$q = \\bar{q} + q'$$\nBy definition of the fluctuations, their time average is zero: $\\overline{w'} = 0$, $\\overline{T'} = 0$, and $\\overline{q'} = 0$. In the context of a horizontally homogeneous surface layer, the mean vertical velocity $\\bar{w}$ is assumed to be zero. Therefore, $w = w'$.\n\nNow, we can express the moist specific enthalpy using the decomposed variables, treating $c_p$ and $L_v$ as constants as specified in the problem statement:\n$$h = c_p (\\bar{T} + T') + L_v (\\bar{q} + q')$$\nThe mean moist specific enthalpy, $\\bar{h}$, is:\n$$\\bar{h} = \\overline{c_p (\\bar{T} + T') + L_v (\\bar{q} + q')} = c_p \\bar{T} + c_p \\overline{T'} + L_v \\bar{q} + L_v \\overline{q'} = c_p \\bar{T} + L_v \\bar{q}$$\nThe fluctuation of moist specific enthalpy, $h'$, is then:\n$$h' = h - \\bar{h} = (c_p T + L_v q) - (c_p \\bar{T} + L_v \\bar{q}) = c_p (T - \\bar{T}) + L_v (q - \\bar{q}) = c_p T' + L_v q'$$\nSubstituting $w = w'$ and the expression for $h'$ into the flux definition, the product $wh$ becomes:\n$$wh = w' (\\bar{h} + h') = w' \\bar{h} + w'h'$$\nThe time average of this product is:\n$$\\overline{wh} = \\overline{w' \\bar{h} + w'h'} = \\bar{h}\\overline{w'} + \\overline{w'h'}$$\nSince $\\overline{w'} = 0$, this simplifies to:\n$$\\overline{wh} = \\overline{w'h'}$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $h'$ into $\\overline{w'h'}$:\n$$\\overline{w'h'} = \\overline{w'(c_p T' + L_v q')}$$\nUsing the distributive property of the averaging operator:\n$$\\overline{w'h'} = \\overline{w'c_p T'} + \\overline{w'L_v q'}$$\nSince $c_p$ and $L_v$ are constants, they can be moved outside the average:\n$$\\overline{w'h'} = c_p \\overline{w'T'} + L_v \\overline{w'q'}$$\nFinally, we substitute this back into the definition for the total enthalpy flux, $F_h$:\n$$F_h = \\rho \\overline{wh} = \\rho(c_p \\overline{w'T'} + L_v \\overline{w'q'}) = \\rho c_p \\overline{w'T'} + \\rho L_v \\overline{w'q'}$$\nThis equation shows the partitioning of the total enthalpy flux.
