            "problem": "Consider a plane-parallel atmosphere used in numerical weather prediction and climate modeling. A shortwave band is dominated by absorption from a single gas with mass density profile $\\,\\rho(z)\\,$ that varies with geometric height $\\,z\\,$. A narrowbeam of radiation travels along a straight, slanted path at zenith angle $\\,\\theta\\,$ relative to the local vertical.

            "solution": "The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. We begin by validating the premises and then proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe one-dimensional, steady-state Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) for a narrow beam of radiation in a purely absorbing medium, with no scattering and no emission, is given by the change in intensity $I$ along the path coordinate $s$:\n$$\n\\frac{dI}{ds} = -\\alpha I\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the volume absorption coefficient. The problem states that the band-mean extinction per unit mass is a constant $k$, and the absorber mass density is $\\rho(z)$. The absorption coefficient is related to these quantities by $\\alpha = k\\rho$. Substituting this into the RTE gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dI}{I} = -k\\rho\\, ds\n$$\nTo find the intensity $I(s_f)$ at a final point $s_f$ along the path, given an initial intensity $I_0$ at $s_0$, we integrate this equation:\n$$\n\\int_{I_0}^{I(s_f)} \\frac{dI'}{I'} = - \\int_{s_0}^{s_f} k\\rho(s')\\, ds'\n$$\nSince $k$ is constant, it can be taken outside the integral:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{I(s_f)}{I_0}\\right) = -k \\int_{s_0}^{s_f} \\rho(s')\\, ds'\n$$\nThe problem defines the path-amount as $u = \\int \\rho\\, ds$. For the full path from the top of the atmosphere ($s_0=0$, where $I=I_0$) to the surface ($s=s_f$), the total path-amount is $u = \\int_{0}^{s_f} \\rho(s')\\, ds'$. Exponentiating both sides of the integrated equation yields the Beer-Lambert-Bouguer law:\n$$\nI(s_f) = I_0 \\exp\\left(-k u\\right)\n$$\nThe transmittance $T$ is defined as the ratio of the transmitted intensity to the incident intensity, $T = I(s_f) / I_0$. Therefore, the expression for transmittance in terms of the path-amount $u$ is:\n$$\nT = \\exp(-ku)\n$$\n\nNext, we must compute the numerical value of the transmittance. This requires calculating the total path-amount $u$. The path is for radiation incident from the top of the atmosphere ($z \\to \\infty$) down to the surface ($z=0$). The relationship between the slant path increment $ds$ and the vertical increment $dz$ is given. As the beam travels downwards, $s$ increases while $z$ decreases. Thus, $dz/ds = -\\cos\\theta = -\\mu$, which implies $ds = -dz/\\mu$. The total path-amount $u$ is the integral of the density $\\rho(z)$ along this path:\n$$\nu = \\int_{\\text{path}} \\rho\\, ds = \\int_{z=\\infty}^{z=0} \\rho(z) \\left(-\\frac{dz}{\\mu}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\rho(z)\\, dz\n$$\nThe integral $\\int_0^\\infty \\rho(z)\\, dz$ represents the total vertical column mass density of the absorber, which we can denote as $U$. We are given the exponential density profile $\\rho(z) = \\rho_{0}\\exp(-z/H)$. We can now compute $U$:\n$$\nU = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\rho_{0}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{H}\\right) dz = \\rho_{0} \\left[ -H \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{H}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = \\rho_{0} \\left( 0 - (-H) \\right) = \\rho_{0}H\n$$\nThe total path-amount is therefore $u = \\frac{\\rho_{0}H}{\\mu}$.\nWe are given the following values:\n$\\rho_0 = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$\n$H = 2.0 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$\\theta = 60^\\circ$, so $\\mu = \\cos(60^\\circ) = 0.5$\n$k = 2.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,kg^{-1}}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the path-amount $u$:\n$$\nu = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}) \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{m})}{0.5} = \\frac{20\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-2}}}{0.5} = 40\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-2}}\n$$\nThe argument of the exponent in the transmittance equation is the optical depth, $\\tau = ku$:\n$$\n\\tau = (2.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,kg^{-1}}) \\times (40\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-2}}) = 0.8\n$$\nThe optical depth is a dimensionless quantity, as expected. The transmittance $T$ is then:\n$$\nT = \\exp(-\\tau) = \\exp(-0.8) \\approx 0.44932896...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the transmittance is $T = 0.4493$.\n\nFinally, we address the physical meaning and dependence of the path-amount $u$.\nThe path-amount $u = \\int \\rho\\, ds$ represents the total mass of the absorbing gas contained within a column of unit cross-sectional area ($1\\,\\mathrm{m^2}$) oriented perpendicular to the direction of radiation, integrated along the entire light path. Its units are mass per area (e.g., $\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-2}}$). It quantifies the total amount of material that a photon encounters and can be absorbed by. For a given mass absorption coefficient $k$, the optical depth $\\tau$ is directly proportional to $u$. A larger path-amount implies a greater number of absorbing molecules in the beam's path, which leads to stronger absorption and lower transmittance.\n\nIn a plane-parallel atmosphere, the relationship between the path-amount $u$ and the zenith angle $\\theta$ is $u(\\theta) = U/\\mu = U/\\cos\\theta$, where $U = \\int_0^\\infty \\rho(z) dz$ is the vertical column amount. For a vertically incident beam ($\\theta=0^\\circ$), $\\cos\\theta=1$ and the path-amount is at its minimum, $u(0^\\circ) = U$. As the zenith angle $\\theta$ increases, the radiation traverses a longer, more slanted path through the atmospheric layers to reach the same vertical depth. The geometric factor $1/\\cos\\theta$, often called the air mass factor in this context, accounts for this path lengthening. Consequently, the path-amount $u$ increases as $\\theta$ increases, approaching infinity as $\\theta \\to 90^\\circ$ in this idealized model. This shows that for the same atmospheric composition, radiation arriving at a slant angle will experience significantly more absorption than radiation arriving from directly overhead.",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It represents a standard problem in atmospheric radiative transfer theory. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe goal is to determine the upwelling specific intensity at the surface, $I_{\\nu}^{+}(0,\\mu)$, and the upwelling spectral flux at the surface, $F_{\\nu}^{+}(0)$. The surface is located at altitude $z=0$.\n\nThe upwelling radiation from the surface is composed of two components: thermal emission from the surface and reflection of the downward incident radiation. According to the Lambertian boundary condition, both emission and reflection are diffuse, meaning the resultant upwelling specific intensity is isotropic (independent of the upwelling direction, parameterized by $\\mu = \\cos\\theta$).\nThus, we can write the upwelling intensity as:\n$$\nI_{\\nu}^{+}(0,\\mu) = I_{\\nu, \\text{emitted}}^{+} + I_{\\nu, \\text{reflected}}^{+}\n$$\nwhere both terms on the right-hand side are independent of $\\mu$.\n\nFirst, we consider the emitted component. For a surface at temperature $T_{s}$ with spectral emissivity $\\epsilon_{\\nu}$, the emitted specific intensity is given by Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation. For a diffuse emitter, this is:\n$$\nI_{\\nu, \\text{emitted}}^{+} = \\epsilon_{\\nu} B_{\\nu}(T_{s})\n$$\nwhere $B_{\\nu}(T_{s})$ is the Planck function at frequency $\\nu$ and temperature $T_{s}$.\n\nSecond, we consider the reflected component. A Lambertian surface reflects incident radiation isotropically. The magnitude of the reflected intensity is proportional to the total incident spectral flux (irradiance), not the incident intensity from a specific direction. The reflected intensity is given by:\n$$\nI_{\\nu, \\text{reflected}}^{+} = \\frac{\\rho_{\\nu} F_{\\nu}^{-}(0)}{\\pi}\n$$\nwhere $\\rho_{\\nu}$ is the hemispheric spectral reflectance and $F_{\\nu}^{-}(0)$ is the downward spectral flux at the surface. The factor of $\\pi$ arises from the relationship between the flux from and the intensity of an isotropic radiator ($F = \\pi I$).\n\nTo find $I_{\\nu, \\text{reflected}}^{+}$, we must first calculate the downward spectral flux $F_{\\nu}^{-}(0)$. The spectral flux is defined as the integral of the normal component of the specific intensity over the relevant hemisphere of solid angles. For the downward flux, we integrate the downward specific intensity $I_{\\nu}^{-}(\\mu)$ over the downward-looking hemisphere ($2\\pi$ steradians).\nIn spherical coordinates, with $\\mu = \\cos\\theta$ where $\\theta$ is the zenith angle, the element of solid angle is $d\\Omega = \\sin\\theta d\\theta d\\phi = -d\\mu d\\phi$.

This expression is the first required result.\n\nNext, we derive the upwelling spectral flux at the surface, $F_{\\nu}^{+}(0)$.

At the bottom of the atmosphere ($\\tau'=\\tau$): $F^{+}(\\tau) = 0$.\n\nApplying the conditions to the general solution:\n1. $F^{-}(0) = C_1 \\alpha + C_2/\\alpha = F_0$\n2. $F^{+}(\\tau) = C_1 e^{k\\tau} + C_2 e^{-k\\tau} = 0 \\implies C_1 = -C_2 e^{-2k\\tau}$\n\nSubstitute $C_1$ into the first equation:\n$$ (-C_2 e^{-2k\\tau})\\alpha + C_2/\\alpha = F_0 \\implies C_2(1/\\alpha - \\alpha e^{-2k\\tau}) = F_0 $$\n$$ C_2 = \\frac{F_0}{1/\\alpha - \\alpha e^{-2k\\tau}} $$\nAnd $C_1$:\n$$ C_1 = -\\frac{F_0 e^{-2k\\tau}}{1/\\alpha - \\alpha e^{-2k\\tau}} $$\nNow we can compute the layer reflectance $R$ and transmittance $T$.\nThe reflectance is $R = F^{+}(0)/F_0$:\n$$ F^{+}(0) = C_1 + C_2 = \\frac{-F_0 e^{-2k\\tau} + F_0}{1/\\alpha - \\alpha e^{-2k\\tau}} = \\frac{F_0(1-e^{-2k\\tau})}{1/\\alpha - \\alpha e^{-2k\\tau}} $$\n$$ R(\\tau, \\omega_0) = \\frac{1-e^{-2k\\tau}}{1/\\alpha - \\alpha e^{-2k\\tau}} = \\frac{\\alpha(1-e^{-2k\\tau})}{1-\\alpha^2 e^{-2k\\tau}} $$\nThe transmittance is $T = F^{-}(\\tau)/F_0$:\n$$ F^{-}(\\tau) = C_1 \\alpha e^{k\\tau} + C_2 \\frac{1}{\\alpha} e^{-k\\tau} = \\frac{-F_0 e^{-2k\\tau}}{1/\\alpha - \\alpha e^{-2k\\tau}} \\alpha e^{k\\tau} + \\frac{F_0}{1/\\alpha - \\alpha e^{-2k\\tau}} \\frac{1}{\\alpha} e^{-k\\tau} $$\n$$ F^{-}(\\tau) = \\frac{F_0 e^{-k\\tau}}{1/\\alpha - \\alpha e^{-2k\\tau}} (-\\alpha + 1/\\alpha) = \\frac{F_0 e^{-k\\tau}(1/\\alpha - \\alpha)}{1/\\alpha - \\alpha e^{-2k\\tau}} $$\n$$ T(\\tau, \\omega_0) = \\frac{e^{-k\\tau}(1-\\alpha^2)/\\alpha}{(1-\\alpha^2 e^{-2k\\tau})/\\alpha} = \\frac{(1-\\alpha^2)e^{-k\\tau}}{1-\\alpha^2 e^{-2k\\tau}} $$\nTo express these solely in terms of $\\tau$ and $\\omega_0$, we can substitute for $\\alpha$ and simplify. A more elegant form is obtained by writing the denominator as $(1+\\sqrt{1-\\omega_0})^2 - (1-\\sqrt{1-\\omega_0})^2 e^{-2k\\tau}$.\nLet $A = 1+\\sqrt{1-\\omega_0}$ and $B = 1-\\sqrt{1-\\omega_0}$. Then $\\alpha = B/A$.\nThe denominator becomes $1 - (B/A)^2 e^{-2k\\tau} = (A^2 - B^2 e^{-2k\\tau})/A^2$.\n$$ R = \\frac{(B/A)(1-e^{-2k\\tau})}{(A^2 - B^2 e^{-2k\\tau})/A^2} = \\frac{AB(1-e^{-2k\\tau})}{A^2 - B^2 e^{-2k\\tau}} $$\n$$ T = \\frac{(1-B^2/A^2)e^{-k\\tau}}{(A^2 - B^2 e^{-2k\\tau})/A^2} = \\frac{(A^2-B^2)e^{-k\\tau}}{A^2 - B^2 e^{-2k\\tau}} $$\nWe use the identities:\n$AB = (1+\\sqrt{1-\\omega_0})(1-\\sqrt{1-\\omega_0}) = 1 - (1-\\omega_0) = \\omega_0$.\n$A^2-B^2 = (A-B)(A+B) = (2\\sqrt{1-\\omega_0})(2) = 4\\sqrt{1-\\omega_0}$.\nSubstituting these into the expressions for $R$ and $T$, we get the final forms.\n\nThus, the dimensionless layer reflectance $R(\\tau, \\omega_0)$ is:\n$$ R(\\tau, \\omega_0) = \\frac{\\omega_0 (1-e^{-2k\\tau})}{(1+\\sqrt{1-\\omega_0})^2 - (1-\\sqrt{1-\\omega_0})^2 e^{-2k\\tau}} $$\nAnd the dimensionless layer transmittance $T(\\tau, \\omega_0)$ is:\n$$ T(\\tau, \\omega_0) = \\frac{4\\sqrt{1-\\omega_0} e^{-k\\tau}}{(1+\\sqrt{1-\\omega_0})^2 - (1-\\sqrt{1-\\omega_0})^2 e^{-2k\\tau}} $$\nIn these expressions, the parameter $k$ is given by $k = \\sqrt{3(1-\\omega_0)}$. These final expressions depend only on the total optical thickness $\\tau$ and the single-scattering albedo $\\omega_0$, as required.",
