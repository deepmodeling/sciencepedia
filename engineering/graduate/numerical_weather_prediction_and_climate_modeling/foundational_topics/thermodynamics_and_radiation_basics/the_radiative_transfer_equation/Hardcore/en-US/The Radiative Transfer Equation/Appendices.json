            "problem": "Consider a plane-parallel atmosphere used in numerical weather prediction and climate modeling. A shortwave band is dominated by absorption from a single gas with mass density profile $\\,\\rho(z)\\,$ that varies with geometric height $\\,z\\,$. A narrowbeam of radiation travels along a straight, slanted path at zenith angle $\\,\\theta\\,$ relative to the local vertical. Assume there is no scattering and no in-band emission and that the atmosphere is horizontally homogeneous.

            "solution": "The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. We begin by validating the premises and then proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe one-dimensional, steady-state Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) for a narrow beam of radiation in a purely absorbing medium, with no scattering and no emission, is given by the change in intensity $I$ along the path coordinate $s$:\n$$\n\\frac{dI}{ds} = -\\alpha I\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the volume absorption coefficient. The problem states that the band-mean extinction per unit mass is a constant $k$, and the absorber mass density is $\\rho(z)$. The absorption coefficient is related to these quantities by $\\alpha = k\\rho$. Substituting this into the RTE gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dI}{I} = -k\\rho\\, ds\n$$\nTo find the intensity $I(s_f)$ at a final point $s_f$ along the path, given an initial intensity $I_0$ at $s_0$, we integrate this equation:\n$$\n\\int_{I_0}^{I(s_f)} \\frac{dI'}{I'} = - \\int_{s_0}^{s_f} k\\rho(s')\\, ds'\n$$\nSince $k$ is constant, it can be taken outside the integral:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{I(s_f)}{I_0}\\right) = -k \\int_{s_0}^{s_f} \\rho(s')\\, ds'\n$$\nThe problem defines the path-amount as $u = \\int \\rho\\, ds$. For the full path from the top of the atmosphere ($s_0=0$, where $I=I_0$) to the surface ($s=s_f$), the total path-amount is $u = \\int_{0}^{s_f} \\rho(s')\\, ds'$. Exponentiating both sides of the integrated equation yields the Beer-Lambert-Bouguer law:\n$$\nI(s_f) = I_0 \\exp\\left(-k u\\right)\n$$\nThe transmittance $T$ is defined as the ratio of the transmitted intensity to the incident intensity, $T = I(s_f) / I_0$. Therefore, the expression for transmittance in terms of the path-amount $u$ is:\n$$\nT = \\exp(-ku)\n$$\n\nNext, we must compute the numerical value of the transmittance. This requires calculating the total path-amount $u$. The path is for radiation incident from the top of the atmosphere ($z \\to \\infty$) down to the surface ($z=0$). The relationship between the slant path increment $ds$ and the vertical increment $dz$ is given. As the beam travels downwards, $s$ increases while $z$ decreases. Thus, $dz/ds = -\\cos\\theta = -\\mu$, which implies $ds = -dz/\\mu$. The total path-amount $u$ is the integral of the density $\\rho(z)$ along this path:\n$$\nu = \\int_{\\text{path}} \\rho\\, ds = \\int_{z=\\infty}^{z=0} \\rho(z) \\left(-\\frac{dz}{\\mu}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\rho(z)\\, dz\n$$\nThe integral $\\int_0^\\infty \\rho(z)\\, dz$ represents the total vertical column mass density of the absorber, which we can denote as $U$. We are given the exponential density profile $\\rho(z) = \\rho_{0}\\exp(-z/H)$. We can now compute $U$:\n$$\nU = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\rho_{0}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{H}\\right) dz = \\rho_{0} \\left[ -H \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{H}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = \\rho_{0} \\left( 0 - (-H) \\right) = \\rho_{0}H\n$$\nThe total path-amount is therefore $u = \\frac{\\rho_{0}H}{\\mu}$.\nWe are given the following values:\n$\\rho_0 = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$\n$H = 2.0 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$\\theta = 60^\\circ$, so $\\mu = \\cos(60^\\circ) = 0.5$\n$k = 2.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,kg^{-1}}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the path-amount $u$:\n$$\nu = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}) \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{m})}{0.5} = \\frac{20\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-2}}}{0.5} = 40\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-2}}\n$$\nThe argument of the exponent in the transmittance equation is the optical depth, $\\tau = ku$:\n$$\n\\tau = (2.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,kg^{-1}}) \\times (40\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-2}}) = 0.8\n$$\nThe optical depth is a dimensionless quantity, as expected. The transmittance $T$ is then:\n$$\nT = \\exp(-\\tau) = \\exp(-0.8) \\approx 0.44932896...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the transmittance is $T = 0.4493$.\n\nFinally, we address the physical meaning and dependence of the path-amount $u$.\nThe path-amount $u = \\int \\rho\\, ds$ represents the total mass of the absorbing gas contained within a column of unit cross-sectional area ($1\\,\\mathrm{m^2}$) oriented perpendicular to the direction of radiation, integrated along the entire light path. Its units are mass per area (e.g., $\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-2}}$). It quantifies the total amount of material that a photon encounters and can be absorbed by. For a given mass absorption coefficient $k$, the optical depth $\\tau$ is directly proportional to $u$. A larger path-amount implies a greater number of absorbing molecules in the beam's path, which leads to stronger absorption and lower transmittance.\n\nIn a plane-parallel atmosphere, the relationship between the path-amount $u$ and the zenith angle $\\theta$ is $u(\\theta) = U/\\mu = U/\\cos\\theta$, where $U = \\int_0^\\infty \\rho(z) dz$ is the vertical column amount. For a vertically incident beam ($\\theta=0^\\circ$), $\\cos\\theta=1$ and the path-amount is at its minimum, $u(0^\\circ) = U$. As the zenith angle $\\theta$ increases, the radiation traverses a longer, more slanted path through the atmospheric layers to reach the same vertical depth. The geometric factor $1/\\cos\\theta$, often called the air mass factor in this context, accounts for this path lengthening. Consequently, the path-amount $u$ increases as $\\theta$ increases, approaching infinity as $\\theta \\to 90^\\circ$ in this idealized model. This shows that for the same atmospheric composition, radiation arriving at a slant angle will experience significantly more absorption than radiation arriving from directly overhead.",

            "solution": "The problem as stated is physically and mathematically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. We shall proceed with its solution.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the transport of radiant energy is the conservation of energy along a ray. The change in spectral specific intensity, $dI_{\\nu}$, over a differential path length $ds$ in a participating medium is the sum of gains from emission and losses from absorption. This is expressed as:\n$$ \\frac{dI_{\\nu}}{ds} = -\\alpha_{\\nu}I_{\\nu} + j_{\\nu} $$\nwhere $\\alpha_{\\nu}$ is the absorption coefficient and $j_{\\nu}$ is the emission coefficient. The problem states that the medium is non-scattering, so scattering terms are absent. Under the condition of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), Kirchhoff's law relates the emission and absorption coefficients via the Planck function $B_{\\nu}(T)$. For a medium with refractive index of unity, this relation is $j_{\\nu} = \\alpha_{\\nu} B_{\\nu}(T)$. The problem gives the spectral absorption coefficient as $\\kappa_{\\nu}$, which is a synonym for $\\alpha_{\\nu}$. Thus, $j_{\\nu} = \\kappa_{\\nu} B_{\\nu}(T_0)$, where the temperature $T_0$ is uniform throughout the slab.\n\nThe equation of transfer becomes:\n$$ \\frac{dI_{\\nu}}{ds} = -\\kappa_{\\nu}I_{\\nu} + \\kappa_{\\nu}B_{\\nu}(T_0) $$\nFor a plane-parallel geometry, the path length $ds$ along a ray is related to the coordinate $x$ normal to the slab by $ds = \\frac{dx}{\\mu}$, where $\\mu = \\cos\\theta$ and $\\theta$ is the polar angle with respect to the $+x$-axis. Substituting this into the equation gives the one-dimensional radiative transfer equation (RTE) for this problem:\n$$ \\mu \\frac{dI_{\\nu}(x, \\mu)}{dx} = -\\kappa_{\\nu}I_{\\nu}(x, \\mu) + \\kappa_{\\nu}B_{\\nu}(T_0) $$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for $I_{\\nu}$ with respect to $x$, which we will solve subject to the given boundary conditions.

The integrating factor is $\\exp\\left(\\int \\frac{\\kappa_{\\nu}}{\\mu} dx\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\kappa_{\\nu}x}{\\mu}\\right)$, since $\\kappa_{\\nu}$ and $\\mu$ are constant with respect to $x$.

Under the specified two-stream approximation with the Eddington closure ($\\bar{\\mu} = 1/\\sqrt{3}$), the RTE simplifies to a set of two coupled, first-order ordinary differential equations for the upward, $F^{+}(\\tau')$, and downward, $F^{-}(\\tau')$, hemispheric fluxes as a function of optical depth $\\tau'$:\n$$ \\frac{dF^{+}(\\tau')}{d\\tau'} = \\frac{1}{\\bar{\\mu}} \\left[ \\left(1-\\frac{\\omega_0}{2}\\right)F^{+}(\\tau') - \\frac{\\omega_0}{2}F^{-}(\\tau') \\right] $$\n$$ \\frac{dF^{-}(\\tau')}{d\\tau'} = \\frac{1}{\\bar{\\mu}} \\left[ \\frac{\\omega_0}{2}F^{+}(\\tau') - \\left(1-\\frac{\\omega_0}{2}\\right)F^{-}(\\tau') \\right] $$\nLet's define the coefficients $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\bar{\\mu}}(1-\\frac{\\omega_0}{2})$ and $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\bar{\\mu}}\\frac{\\omega_0}{2}$. The system is:\n$$ \\frac{dF^{+}}{d\\tau'} = \\gamma_1 F^{+} - \\gamma_2 F^{-} $$\n$$ \\frac{dF^{-}}{d\\tau'} = \\gamma_2 F^{+} - \\gamma_1 F^{-} $$\nThis is a system of linear ordinary differential equations, which can be solved by seeking solutions of the form $F^{\\pm}(\\tau') \\propto \\exp(\\lambda \\tau')$. The eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are found from the characteristic equation of the system's matrix:\n$$ \\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\gamma_1 - \\lambda & -\\gamma_2 \\\\ \\gamma_2 & -\\gamma_1 - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0 $$\n$$ -(\\gamma_1 - \\lambda)(\\gamma_1 + \\lambda) + \\gamma_2^2 = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda^2 - \\gamma_1^2 + \\gamma_2^2 = 0 \\implies \\lambda^2 = \\gamma_1^2 - \\gamma_2^2 $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$:\n$$ \\lambda^2 = \\frac{1}{\\bar{\\mu}^2} \\left[ \\left(1-\\frac{\\omega_0}{2}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{\\omega_0}{2}\\right)^2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{\\bar{\\mu}^2} \\left( 1 - \\omega_0 \\right) $$\nLet's define $k \\equiv \\frac{\\sqrt{1-\\omega_0}}{\\bar{\\mu}}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda = \\pm k$. With the given $\\bar{\\mu}=1/\\sqrt{3}$, we have $k = \\sqrt{3(1-\\omega_0)}$.\nThe general solution is a linear combination of the modes corresponding to the two eigenvalues:\n$$ F^{+}(\\tau') = C_1 e^{k\\tau'} + C_2 e^{-k\\tau'} $$\nThe corresponding solutions for $F^{-}$ are found from the first differential equation, $F^{-} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_2}(\\gamma_1 F^{+} - \\frac{dF^{+}}{d\\tau'})$.\nFor the $e^{k\\tau'}$ mode, $F^{-} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_2}(\\gamma_1 e^{k\\tau'} - k e^{k\\tau'}) = \\frac{\\gamma_1 - k}{\\gamma_2} e^{k\\tau'}$.\nFor the $e^{-k\\tau'}$ mode, $F^{-} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_2}(\\gamma_1 e^{-k\\tau'} + k e^{-k\\tau'}) = \\frac{\\gamma_1 + k}{\\gamma_2} e^{-k\\tau'}$.\nLet's define the ratio $\\alpha = \\frac{\\gamma_1 - k}{\\gamma_2}$. We can show that $\\frac{\\gamma_1+k}{\\gamma_2} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha}$.\nThe general solution for the fluxes is:\n$$ F^{+}(\\tau') = C_1 e^{k\\tau'} + C_2 e^{-k\\tau'} $$\n$$ F^{-}(\\tau') = C_1 \\alpha e^{k\\tau'} + C_2 \\frac{1}{\\alpha} e^{-k\\tau'} $$\nThe parameter $\\alpha$ can be simplified:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\bar{\\mu}}(1-\\frac{\\omega_0}{2}) - \\frac{\\sqrt{1-\\omega_0}}{\\bar{\\mu}}}{\\frac{1}{\\bar{\\mu}}\\frac{\\omega_0}{2}} = \\frac{2-\\omega_0 - 2\\sqrt{1-\\omega_0}}{\\omega_0} $$\nLet $x = \\sqrt{1-\\omega_0}$, so $\\omega_0 = 1-x^2$.\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{2-(1-x^2)-2x}{1-x^2} = \\frac{1-2x+x^2}{1-x^2} = \\frac{(1-x)^2}{(1-x)(1+x)} = \\frac{1-x}{1+x} $$\nThus, $\\alpha = \\frac{1-\\sqrt{1-\\omega_0}}{1+\\sqrt{1-\\omega_0}}$.\n\nNext, we apply the boundary conditions. The total optical thickness of the layer is $\\tau$.\n1. At the top of the atmosphere ($\\tau'=0$): $F^{-}(0) = F_0$.\n2. At the bottom of the atmosphere ($\\tau'=\\tau$): $F^{+}(\\tau) = 0$.\n\nApplying the conditions to the general solution:\n1. $F^{-}(0) = C_1 \\alpha + C_2/\\alpha = F_0$\n2. $F^{+}(\\tau) = C_1 e^{k\\tau} + C_2 e^{-k\\tau} = 0 \\implies C_1 = -C_2 e^{-2k\\tau}$\n\nSubstitute $C_1$ into the first equation:\n$$ (-C_2 e^{-2k\\tau})\\alpha + C_2/\\alpha = F_0 \\implies C_2(1/\\alpha - \\alpha e^{-2k\\tau}) = F_0 $$\n$$ C_2 = \\frac{F_0}{1/\\alpha - \\alpha e^{-2k\\tau}} $$\nAnd $C_1$:\n$$ C_1 = -\\frac{F_0 e^{-2k\\tau}}{1/\\alpha - \\alpha e^{-2k\\tau}} $$\nNow we can compute the layer reflectance $R$ and transmittance $T$.\nThe reflectance is $R = F^{+}(0)/F_0$:\n$$ F^{+}(0) = C_1 + C_2 = \\frac{-F_0 e^{-2k\\tau} + F_0}{1/\\alpha - \\alpha e^{-2k\\tau}} = \\frac{F_0(1-e^{-2k\\tau})}{1/\\alpha - \\alpha e^{-2k\\tau}} $$\n$$ R(\\tau, \\omega_0) = \\frac{1-e^{-2k\\tau}}{1/\\alpha - \\alpha e^{-2k\\tau}} = \\frac{\\alpha(1-e^{-2k\\tau})}{1-\\alpha^2 e^{-2k\\tau}} $$\nThe transmittance is $T = F^{-}(\\tau)/F_0$:\n$$ F^{-}(\\tau) = C_1 \\alpha e^{k\\tau} + C_2 \\frac{1}{\\alpha} e^{-k\\tau} = \\frac{-F_0 e^{-2k\\tau}}{1/\\alpha - \\alpha e^{-2k\\tau}} \\alpha e^{k\\tau} + \\frac{F_0}{1/\\alpha - \\alpha e^{-2k\\tau}} \\frac{1}{\\alpha} e^{-k\\tau} $$\n$$ F^{-}(\\tau) = \\frac{F_0 e^{-k\\tau}}{1/\\alpha - \\alpha e^{-2k\\tau}} (-\\alpha + 1/\\alpha) = \\frac{F_0 e^{-k\\tau}(1/\\alpha - \\alpha)}{1/\\alpha - \\alpha e^{-2k\\tau}} $$\n$$ T(\\tau, \\omega_0) = \\frac{e^{-k\\tau}(1-\\alpha^2)/\\alpha}{(1-\\alpha^2 e^{-2k\\tau})/\\alpha} = \\frac{(1-\\alpha^2)e^{-k\\tau}}{1-\\alpha^2 e^{-2k\\tau}} $$\nTo express these solely in terms of $\\tau$ and $\\omega_0$, we can substitute for $\\alpha$ and simplify. A more elegant form is obtained by writing the denominator as $(1+\\sqrt{1-\\omega_0})^2 - (1-\\sqrt{1-\\omega_0})^2 e^{-2k\\tau}$.\nLet $A = 1+\\sqrt{1-\\omega_0}$ and $B = 1-\\sqrt{1-\\omega_0}$. Then $\\alpha = B/A$.\nThe denominator becomes $1 - (B/A)^2 e^{-2k\\tau} = (A^2 - B^2 e^{-2k\\tau})/A^2$.\n$$ R = \\frac{(B/A)(1-e^{-2k\\tau})}{(A^2 - B^2 e^{-2k\\tau})/A^2} = \\frac{AB(1-e^{-2k\\tau})}{A^2 - B^2 e^{-2k\\tau}} $$\n$$ T = \\frac{(1-B^2/A^2)e^{-k\\tau}}{(A^2 - B^2 e^{-2k\\tau})/A^2} = \\frac{(A^2-B^2)e^{-k\\tau}}{A^2 - B^2 e^{-2k\\tau}} $$\nWe use the identities:\n$AB = (1+\\sqrt{1-\\omega_0})(1-\\sqrt{1-\\omega_0}) = 1 - (1-\\omega_0) = \\omega_0$.\n$A^2-B^2 = (A-B)(A+B) = (2\\sqrt{1-\\omega_0})(2) = 4\\sqrt{1-\\omega_0}$.\nSubstituting these into the expressions for $R$ and $T$, we get the final forms.\n\nThus, the dimensionless layer reflectance $R(\\tau, \\omega_0)$ is:\n$$ R(\\tau, \\omega_0) = \\frac{\\omega_0 (1-e^{-2k\\tau})}{(1+\\sqrt{1-\\omega_0})^2 - (1-\\sqrt{1-\\omega_0})^2 e^{-2k\\tau}} $$\nAnd the dimensionless layer transmittance $T(\\tau, \\omega_0)$ is:\n$$ T(\\tau, \\omega_0) = \\frac{4\\sqrt{1-\\omega_0} e^{-k\\tau}}{(1+\\sqrt{1-\\omega_0})^2 - (1-\\sqrt{1-\\omega_0})^2 e^{-2k\\tau}} $$\nIn these expressions, the parameter $k$ is given by $k = \\sqrt{3(1-\\omega_0)}$. These final expressions depend only on the total optical thickness $\\tau$ and the single-scattering albedo $\\omega_0$, as required.",
