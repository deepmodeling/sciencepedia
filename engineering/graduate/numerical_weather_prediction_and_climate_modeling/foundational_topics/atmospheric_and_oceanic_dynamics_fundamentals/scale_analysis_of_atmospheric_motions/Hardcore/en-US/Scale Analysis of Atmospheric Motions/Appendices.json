This first practice invites you to apply this technique to mid-latitude synoptic systems, the familiar stage for weather patterns. By calculating four fundamental dimensionless numbers—the Rossby ($Ro$), Froude ($Fr$), Reynolds ($Re$), and Prandtl ($Pr$) numbers—you will quantify the relative importance of inertia, rotation, stratification, and friction.

            "problem": "In Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) and climate modeling, the scale analysis of midlatitude synoptic motions begins from the rotating, stably stratified Boussinesq primitive equations for momentum, mass continuity, and a scalar (e.g., potential temperature) that determines buoyancy. Consider a horizontally uniform, baroclinic flow on an $f$-plane (constant Coriolis parameter) with uniform background stratification characterized by the Brunt–Väisälä frequency $N$. Let the characteristic horizontal velocity scale be $U$, horizontal length scale $L$, vertical length scale $H$, and advective time scale $T=L/U$. Molecular kinematic viscosity is $\\nu$ and molecular thermal diffusivity is $\\kappa$. Using these scales to nondimensionalize the governing equations, identify the nondimensional parameters associated with: the ratio of inertial to viscous effects in momentum; the ratio of momentum diffusion to scalar diffusion; the ratio of inertial to Coriolis effects; and the ratio of flow speed to the internal gravity wave speed set by stratification. Then, evaluate these parameters for the synoptic-scale values $U=10\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $L=1000\\,\\mathrm{km}$, $H=10\\,\\mathrm{km}$, $T=L/U$, $\\nu=10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $\\kappa=10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $f=10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, and $N=10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the identification, evaluation, and interpretation of four key nondimensional parameters in the context of midlatitude synoptic-scale atmospheric motions. The process involves using characteristic scales to form dimensionless ratios that represent the relative importance of different physical effects described in the primitive equations.\n\nFirst, I will identify the four requested nondimensional parameters based on their physical definitions. The primitive equations for a Boussinesq fluid on a rotating $f$-plane include terms for inertia (advection), Coriolis force, pressure gradient, buoyancy, and diffusion (viscous and thermal). Let $U$ be the characteristic horizontal velocity scale, $L$ the horizontal length scale, $H$ the vertical length scale, $f$ the Coriolis parameter, $N$ the Brunt–Väisälä frequency, $\\nu$ the kinematic viscosity, and $\\kappa$ the thermal diffusivity.\n\n1.  **Ratio of inertial to viscous effects in momentum**: This is the Reynolds number, $Re$. The inertial term in the momentum equation is the advection term, $(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{u}$, which scales as $U^2/L$. The viscous term is $\\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$. In large-scale atmospheric flows, derivative scales are anisotropic, i.e., $\\partial/\\partial x \\sim 1/L$ and $\\partial/\\partial z \\sim 1/H$. Since $L \\gg H$, the vertical shear term $\\nu \\partial^2 \\mathbf{u}/\\partial z^2$ would dominate the viscous effects, scaling as $\\nu U/H^2$. However, the standard definition of the Reynolds number uses a single characteristic length scale, which for synoptic flow is the horizontal scale $L$. Using this convention, the viscous term is scaled as $\\nu U/L^2$. The ratio of the inertial term scale to the viscous term scale is therefore:\n    $$Re = \\frac{U^2/L}{\\nu U/L^2} = \\frac{UL}{\\nu}$$\n\n2.  **Ratio of momentum diffusion to scalar diffusion**: This is the Prandtl number, $Pr$. It is a fluid property defined as the ratio of the kinematic viscosity (momentum diffusivity) to the thermal diffusivity (scalar diffusivity).\n    $$Pr = \\frac{\\nu}{\\kappa}$$\n\n3.  **Ratio of inertial to Coriolis effects**: This is the Rossby number, $Ro$. The inertial term, as before, scales as $U^2/L$. The Coriolis term, $f \\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{u}$, scales as $fU$. The ratio gives the Rossby number:\n    $$Ro = \\frac{U^2/L}{fU} = \\frac{U}{fL}$$\n\n4.  **Ratio of flow speed to the internal gravity wave speed**: This is the Froude number, $Fr$. The characteristic flow speed is $U$. For a stably stratified fluid, the maximum speed of long internal gravity waves depends on the stratification, represented by $N$, and the vertical scale of the motion, $H$. The wave speed $c_{IGW}$ scales as $NH$. The ratio defines the Froude number for a stratified flow:\n    $$Fr = \\frac{U}{NH}$$\n\nNext, I will evaluate these four parameters using the provided synoptic-scale values. The given values are:\n$U = 10\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$L = 1000\\,\\mathrm{km} = 1 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$H = 10\\,\\mathrm{km} = 1 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$\\nu = 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$\\kappa = 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$f = 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$N = 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nThe calculations proceed as follows:\n\nFor the Reynolds number, $Re$:\n$$Re = \\frac{UL}{\\nu} = \\frac{(10\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(1 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{m})}{10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{10^7}{10^{-5}} = 10^{12}$$\nRounded to three significant figures, this is $1.00 \\times 10^{12}$.\n\nFor the Prandtl number, $Pr$:\n$$Pr = \\frac{\\nu}{\\kappa} = \\frac{10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 1$$\nRounded to three significant figures, this is $1.00$.\n\nFor the Rossby number, $Ro$:\n$$Ro = \\frac{U}{fL} = \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{(10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(1 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{m})} = \\frac{10}{100} = 0.1$$\nRounded to three significant figures, this is $0.100$.\n\nFor the Froude number, $Fr$:\n$$Fr = \\frac{U}{NH} = \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{(10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(1 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{m})} = \\frac{10}{100} = 0.1$$\nRounded to three significant figures, this is $0.100$.\n\nFinally, I will interpret the magnitudes of these parameters.\n\nThe Reynolds number, $Re = 1.00 \\times 10^{12}$, is extremely large. This signifies that for synoptic-scale motions, inertial forces are astronomically larger than the forces due to molecular viscosity. Consequently, molecular diffusion of momentum is entirely negligible in the dynamics of the large-scale flow. The immense value of $Re$ indicates that the flow is highly turbulent, and any dissipation of energy occurs through a turbulent cascade to smaller scales, not directly through molecular viscosity at the synoptic scale. In practical NWP models, this effect is represented by sub-grid scale parameterizations of turbulence, using an \"eddy viscosity\" that is many orders of magnitude larger than $\\nu$.\n\nThe Prandtl number, $Pr = 1.00$, indicates that the molecular diffusivities for momentum and the scalar (heat) are equal. While the problem specifies values leading to $Pr=1$, the actual value for air is closer to $0.71$. In either case, since both diffusive processes are negligible at the synoptic scale (as shown by the huge $Re$), the exact value of $Pr$ is not dynamically significant for the large-scale evolution. It becomes relevant only at the smallest, dissipative scales of turbulence.\n\nThe Rossby number, $Ro = 0.100$, is small ($Ro \\ll 1$). This is the defining characteristic of large-scale atmospheric and oceanic flows. It indicates that the Coriolis force is an order of magnitude larger than the inertial (advective acceleration) force. This strong rotational constraint implies that the flow is nearly in geostrophic balance, where the pressure gradient force is balanced primarily by the Coriolis force. The small but finite Rossby number means that ageostrophic effects, while secondary, are present and are crucial for the evolution of weather systems, as they drive vertical motion and changes in vorticity.\n\nThe Froude number, $Fr = 0.100$, is also small ($Fr \\ll 1$). This indicates that the flow is strongly stratified. The horizontal flow speed $U$ is small compared to the speed of internal gravity waves $NH$. This strong stratification provides a powerful restoring force against vertical displacement, effectively \"stiffening\" the atmosphere in the vertical. As a result, motions are predominantly horizontal or \"quasi-horizontal,\" and vertical velocities are much smaller than horizontal velocities.\n\nThe combination of a small Rossby number and a small Froude number is fundamental to the theory of quasi-geostrophic motion, which provides a simplified yet powerful framework for understanding the dynamics of midlatitude synoptic systems. The relative importance of rotation and stratification is measured by the Burger number, $Bu = (Fr/Ro)^2 = (fL/NH)^2$. In this case, with $Ro=Fr$, we have $Bu=1$, which corresponds to a Rossby radius of deformation, $L_D = NH/f = (10^{-2} \\cdot 10^4)/10^{-4} = 10^6\\,\\mathrm{m}$, that is equal to the length scale of the flow, $L$. This regime ($Bu \\sim 1$) is where rotational and stratification effects are of comparable importance in shaping the dynamics.",

The nondimensional equation is $Ro \\frac{D\\boldsymbol{u}^{*}}{Dt^{*}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{k}}\\times\\boldsymbol{u}^{*} \\approx -\\text{(const)}\\nabla^{*}p^{*}$.\n\n-   For the **mesoscale**, $Ro_{\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 3.88 \\gg 1$. The Rossby number is large, indicating that the inertial acceleration term ($Ro$ times the material derivative) is substantially larger than the Coriolis term. The dynamics are highly nonlinear and dominated by inertia. The Coriolis force acts as a smaller perturbation. A balance between inertial forces and the pressure gradient force is expected, and the system is far from geostrophic balance.\n\n-   For the **synoptic scale**, $Ro_{\\mathrm{s}} \\approx 0.0970 \\ll 1$. The Rossby number is small. This implies that the inertial acceleration term is an order of magnitude smaller than the Coriolis and pressure gradient terms. To the lowest order, the inertial term can be neglected, leading to a primary balance between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force: $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{k}}\\times\\boldsymbol{u}^{*} \\approx -\\text{(const)}\\nabla^{*}p^{*}$. This is the geostrophic balance. Large-scale weather systems (highs and lows) are well-approximated by this balance.\n\n-   For the **planetary scale**, $Ro_{\\mathrm{p}} \\approx 0.0291 \\ll 1$. The Rossby number is even smaller than for the synoptic scale. This indicates that the flow is very strongly constrained by Earth's rotation, and the geostrophic balance is an extremely accurate leading-order approximation. Inertial effects are minimal compared to the Coriolis and pressure gradient forces. It is critical to note that for such large scales, the f-plane approximation (constant $f$) breaks down, and the variation of $f$ with latitude (the $\\beta$-effect) becomes a dominant physical mechanism, which is essential for planetary Rossby waves. However, within the confines of the f-plane model presented, the conclusion is one of an exceptionally strong geostrophic constraint.\n\nThe transition from mesoscale to planetary scale is a transition from an inertia-dominated regime to a rotation-dominated (geostrophic) regime.",

Therefore, the advective term $u_r \\frac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial r}$ is of second order in the small radial velocity and can be neglected compared to the other terms.\n\nApplying these simplifications, the equation reduces to:\n$$ -\\frac{v_{\\theta}^2}{r} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r} + f v_{\\theta} $$\nThis is the desired leading-order steady, axisymmetric horizontal radial momentum balance, known as the **gradient wind balance**. Rearranging the terms to represent a balance of forces (per unit mass) makes the physical meaning clearer:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r} = f v_{\\theta} + \\frac{v_{\\theta}^2}{r} $$\nThis equation states that the inward-directed pressure gradient force (left side) is balanced by the sum of the outward-directed Coriolis force ($f v_{\\theta}$) and the outward-directed centrifugal force ($\\frac{v_{\\theta}^2}{r}$).\n\nThe geostrophic balance is a simpler balance where the pressure gradient force is balanced solely by the Coriolis force, neglecting all acceleration terms: $\\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r} = f v_g$, where $v_g$ is the geostrophic wind. The gradient wind balance modifies the geostrophic balance by including the centrifugal acceleration, $\\frac{v_{\\theta}^2}{r}$, which arises from the curvature of the flow streamlines. This term is explicitly identified as the **curvature contribution**. For a cyclonic vortex ($v_{\\theta}  0$) in the Northern Hemisphere ($f  0$), this term adds to the Coriolis force, meaning the pressure gradient must be stronger to support the flow, or for a given pressure gradient, the gradient wind $v_{\\theta}$ is less than the geostrophic wind $v_g$.\n\nTo form a nondimensional measure of the curvature term's importance relative to the Coriolis term, we take the ratio of their magnitudes. The magnitude of the curvature acceleration is $\\frac{v_{\\theta}^2}{r}$. The magnitude of the Coriolis acceleration is $|f v_{\\theta}|$. The ratio is:\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\left| \\frac{v_{\\theta}^2}{r} \\right|}{|f v_{\\theta}|} = \\frac{|v_{\\theta}|}{|f|r} $$\nThis dimensionless quantity is known as the Rossby number, which generally measures the ratio of inertial to Coriolis forces.\n\nFinally, we estimate this ratio for the given tropical cyclone. We use the characteristic scales provided: $v_{\\theta} \\approx U$, $r \\approx R$.\nThe given values are:\n-   Characteristic azimuthal wind speed, $U = 50~\\mathrm{m}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n-   Radius of curvature, $R = 50~\\mathrm{km} = 50 \\times 10^3~\\mathrm{m}$.\n-   Latitude, $\\phi = 15^{\\circ}$.\n-   Earth's rotation rate, $\\Omega = 7.2921 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the Coriolis parameter $f$ at the given latitude:\n$$ f = 2 \\Omega \\sin\\phi = 2 \\times (7.2921 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times \\sin(15^{\\circ}) $$\n$$ \\sin(15^{\\circ}) \\approx 0.258819 $$\n$$ f \\approx 2 \\times (7.2921 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times 0.258819 \\approx 3.77535 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nNow, we calculate the nondimensional ratio:\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{U}{f R} = \\frac{50~\\mathrm{m}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{(3.77535 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (50 \\times 10^3~\\mathrm{m})} $$\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{50}{3.77535 \\times 10^{-5} \\times 5 \\times 10^4} = \\frac{50}{1.887675} \\approx 26.4871 $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the ratio is $26.5$. A value much greater than $1$ indicates that the curvature term is significantly larger than the Coriolis term, meaning that the geostrophic approximation is very poor for this system and the flow is highly ageostrophic. The primary balance is between the pressure gradient and the centrifugal force (a cyclostrophic balance).",
