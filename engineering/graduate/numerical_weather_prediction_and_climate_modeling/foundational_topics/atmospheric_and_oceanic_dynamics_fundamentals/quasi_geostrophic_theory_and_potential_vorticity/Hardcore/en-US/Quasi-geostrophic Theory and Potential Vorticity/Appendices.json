            "problem": "Consider a midlatitude flow that satisfies the quasi-geostrophic (QG) approximations on an $f$-plane, with constant Coriolis parameter $f_0$. Assume the atmosphere is in geostrophic balance and hydrostatic balance, and obeys the ideal gas law. The potential temperature $\\theta$ is defined by $\\theta = T \\left( \\frac{p_0}{p} \\right)^{R/c_p}$, where $T$ is temperature, $p$ is pressure, $p_0$ is a fixed reference pressure, $R$ is the specific gas constant for dry air, and $c_p$ is the specific heat at constant pressure.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the thermal wind relationship in terms of potential temperature and its subsequent application to estimate a horizontal potential temperature gradient. This derivation will be based on the fundamental principles of geostrophic balance, hydrostatic balance, the ideal gas law, and the definition of potential temperature, all given in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, the fundamental equations are stated in a convenient coordinate system. Since the derivation involves gradients on constant pressure surfaces, it is most natural to work in pressure coordinates $(x, y, p)$.\n\nThe geostrophic wind, $\\mathbf{u}_g$, is defined by the balance between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force. In pressure coordinates, this relationship is expressed in terms of the geopotential, $\\Phi = gz$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity and $z$ is the geopotential height:\n$$ f_0 \\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{u}_g = -\\nabla_p \\Phi $$\nHere, $f_0$ is the constant Coriolis parameter, $\\mathbf{k}$ is the vertical unit vector, and $\\nabla_p$ is the horizontal gradient operator on a constant pressure surface.\n\nThe hydrostatic balance equation is $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} = -\\rho g$, where $\\rho$ is the density. In pressure coordinates, this is more conveniently expressed by relating the change in geopotential to the change in pressure:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial p} = \\frac{\\partial(gz)}{\\partial p} = g \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial p} = g \\left( \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} \\right)^{-1} = g \\left( -\\rho g \\right)^{-1} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} $$\n\nThe ideal gas law is given by $p = \\rho R T$, where $R$ is the specific gas constant and $T$ is the temperature. This can be written as $\\frac{1}{\\rho} = \\frac{RT}{p}$. Substituting this into the hydrostatic equation yields:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial p} = -\\frac{RT}{p} $$\n\nTo find the vertical shear of the geostrophic wind, we differentiate the geostrophic balance equation with respect to pressure $p$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p} (f_0 \\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{u}_g) = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}(\\nabla_p \\Phi) $$\nSince $f_0$ is constant and the differential operators commute, this becomes:\n$$ f_0 \\mathbf{k} \\times \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_g}{\\partial p} = -\\nabla_p \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial p} \\right) $$\nSubstituting the hydrostatic relation for $\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial p}$:\n$$ f_0 \\mathbf{k} \\times \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_g}{\\partial p} = -\\nabla_p \\left( -\\frac{RT}{p} \\right) = \\nabla_p \\left( \\frac{RT}{p} \\right) $$\nOn a constant pressure surface, $p$ is constant with respect to the horizontal gradient operator $\\nabla_p$, so:\n$$ f_0 \\mathbf{k} \\times \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_g}{\\partial p} = \\frac{R}{p} \\nabla_p T $$\nThis is the thermal wind equation in terms of temperature $T$. The problem requires it in terms of potential temperature $\\theta$.\n\nThe potential temperature $\\theta$ is defined as $\\theta = T \\left( \\frac{p_0}{p} \\right)^{\\kappa}$, where $\\kappa = R/c_p$. Taking the natural logarithm gives $\\ln \\theta = \\ln T - \\kappa \\ln p + \\kappa \\ln p_0$. Applying the $\\nabla_p$ operator to this expression:\n$$ \\nabla_p(\\ln \\theta) = \\nabla_p(\\ln T) - \\nabla_p(\\kappa \\ln p) + \\nabla_p(\\kappa \\ln p_0) $$\nSince $p$ and $p_0$ are constant with respect to $\\nabla_p$, their gradients are zero. Thus, we find the useful relation:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\theta} \\nabla_p \\theta = \\frac{1}{T} \\nabla_p T \\quad \\implies \\quad \\nabla_p T = \\frac{T}{\\theta} \\nabla_p \\theta $$\nSubstituting this into the thermal wind equation for $T$:\n$$ f_0 \\mathbf{k} \\times \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_g}{\\partial p} = \\frac{R}{p} \\left( \\frac{T}{\\theta} \\nabla_p \\theta \\right) = \\frac{RT}{p\\theta} \\nabla_p \\theta $$\nUsing the ideal gas law, $p = \\rho R T \\implies \\frac{RT}{p} = \\frac{1}{\\rho}$, we can simplify the expression:\n$$ f_0 \\mathbf{k} \\times \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_g}{\\partial p} = \\frac{1}{\\rho \\theta} \\nabla_p \\theta $$\nThe problem asks for the vertical wind shear with respect to height $z$, $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_g}{\\partial z}$. We convert the vertical derivative from $p$ to $z$ using the chain rule and the hydrostatic equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_g}{\\partial p} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_g}{\\partial z} \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial p} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_g}{\\partial z} \\left( -\\frac{1}{\\rho g} \\right) $$\nSubstituting this into our equation:\n$$ f_0 \\mathbf{k} \\times \\left( -\\frac{1}{\\rho g} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_g}{\\partial z} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\rho \\theta} \\nabla_p \\theta $$\nThe density $\\rho$ cancels from both sides:\n$$ -\\frac{f_0}{g} \\mathbf{k} \\times \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_g}{\\partial z} = \\frac{1}{\\theta} \\nabla_p \\theta $$\nThe gradient $\\nabla_p \\theta$ is the horizontal gradient on a constant pressure surface, which is denoted as $\\nabla_h \\theta$ in the problem statement. To solve for $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_g}{\\partial z}$, we first multiply by $-\\frac{g}{f_0}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{k} \\times \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_g}{\\partial z} = -\\frac{g}{f_0 \\theta} \\nabla_h \\theta $$\nApplying the cross product with $\\mathbf{k}$ to both sides and using the vector identity $\\mathbf{k} \\times (\\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{A}) = -\\mathbf{A}$ for any horizontal vector $\\mathbf{A}$ (which $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_g}{\\partial z}$ is):\n$$ \\mathbf{k} \\times \\left(\\mathbf{k} \\times \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_g}{\\partial z}\\right) = -\\frac{g}{f_0 \\theta} (\\mathbf{k} \\times \\nabla_h \\theta) $$\n$$ -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_g}{\\partial z} = -\\frac{g}{f_0 \\theta} \\mathbf{k} \\times \\nabla_h \\theta $$\nThis yields the final derived relationship, the thermal wind equation in terms of potential temperature:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_g}{\\partial z} = \\frac{g}{f_0 \\theta} \\mathbf{k} \\times \\nabla_h \\theta $$\n\nFor the second part of the problem, we must estimate the magnitude of the horizontal potential temperature gradient, $\\|\\nabla_h \\theta\\|$. We take the magnitude of both sides of the derived vector equation:\n$$ \\left\\| \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_g}{\\partial z} \\right\\| = \\left\\| \\frac{g}{f_0 \\theta} \\mathbf{k} \\times \\nabla_h \\theta \\right\\| $$\nSince $g$, $f_0$, and $\\theta$ are positive scalars:\n$$ \\left\\| \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_g}{\\partial z} \\right\\| = \\frac{g}{f_0 \\theta} \\| \\mathbf{k} \\times \\nabla_h \\theta \\| $$\nThe magnitude of the cross product of the vertical unit vector $\\mathbf{k}$ and the horizontal gradient vector $\\nabla_h \\theta$ is $\\|\\mathbf{k}\\| \\|\\nabla_h \\theta\\| \\sin(\\pi/2) = \\|\\nabla_h \\theta\\|$, as they are orthogonal. So, the equation becomes:\n$$ \\left\\| \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_g}{\\partial z} \\right\\| = \\frac{g}{f_0 \\theta} \\| \\nabla_h \\theta \\| $$\nWe are asked to use the approximation $\\theta \\approx \\theta_0$.

The nonlinear self-advection term $J(\\psi,\\zeta)$ is identically zero for all $(x,y)$.\n\nThe structural reason for this vanishing is that the field $\\zeta$ is functionally dependent on the field $\\psi$.

The contours of the streamfunction $\\psi$ are streamlines, which are everywhere parallel to the velocity vector $\\mathbf{u}$. The condition $\\zeta = C\\psi$ implies that the contours of constant vorticity (iso-vorticity lines) are identical to the contours of the streamfunction. Therefore, the flow is everywhere parallel to the iso-vorticity lines. Advection can only change a field's value by transporting it across its own contour lines. Since the flow is parallel to the contours of $\\zeta$, it cannot advect vorticity, and the advection term is zero. In the context of the barotropic vorticity equation on an $f$-plane, $\\frac{\\partial\\zeta}{\\partial t} + J(\\psi,\\zeta) = 0$ (for unforced, inviscid flow). Because $J(\\psi,\\zeta)=0$, it follows that $\\frac{\\partial\\zeta}{\\partial t}=0$. This means the flow field is stationary.

            "solution": "### Part 1: Derivation of the PV Inversion Relation\n\nThe geostrophic velocity components $(u_g, v_g)$ are defined in terms of a streamfunction $\\psi(x,y)$:\n$$u_g(x,y) = -\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial y}$$\n$$v_g(x,y) = \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x}$$\nThe relative vorticity, $\\zeta$, is the vertical component of the curl of the velocity field:\n$$\\zeta(x,y) = \\frac{\\partial v_g}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial u_g}{\\partial y}$$\nSubstituting the definitions of $u_g$ and $v_g$ yields a direct relationship between relative vorticity and the streamfunction:\n$$\\zeta = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x}\\right) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(-\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial y}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial y^2} = \\nabla^2 \\psi$$\nwhere $\\nabla^2$ is the horizontal Laplacian operator.\n\nThe quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity (QG PV) anomaly, $q$, for a one-layer (or reduced gravity, barotropic) model is defined as the sum of the relative vorticity anomaly and a vortex stretching term. The stretching term is proportional to the deviation of the fluid surface from its mean height, which, under the geostrophic and hydrostatic approximations, is proportional to the streamfunction $\\psi$. This relationship is parameterized by the barotropic Rossby radius of deformation, $L_D$. The standard definition is:\n$$q(x,y) = \\zeta(x,y) - \\frac{1}{L_D^2} \\psi(x,y)$$\nCombining the two expressions, we substitute $\\zeta = \\nabla^2 \\psi$ into the definition of $q$:\n$$q(x,y) = \\nabla^2 \\psi(x,y) - \\frac{1}{L_D^2} \\psi(x,y)$$\nThis is the linear elliptic partial differential equation that relates the PV anomaly field $q$ to the streamfunction $\\psi$. It is a Helmholtz equation. The process of finding $\\psi$ for a given $q$ is known as PV inversion.\n\nIn the limit where the deformation radius is very large, $L_D \\rightarrow \\infty$, the stretching term vanishes. This limit corresponds to a purely two-dimensional, non-divergent flow. The equation simplifies to the Poisson equation:\n$$q(x,y) = \\nabla^2 \\psi(x,y) \\quad (\\text{for } L_D \\rightarrow \\infty)$$\n\n### Part 2: Numerical Inversion Methods\n\nThe derived PV inversion relation is solved numerically using two distinct methods dictated by the boundary conditions.\n\n#### Method 1: Spectral Inversion on a Doubly Periodic Domain\n\nFor a domain that is periodic in both the $x$ and $y$ directions with lengths $L_x$ and $L_y$, Fourier methods are exceptionally efficient and accurate. We represent the fields $\\psi(x,y)$ and $q(x,y)$ by their discrete Fourier series:\n$$\\psi(x_j, y_k) = \\sum_{m,n} \\hat{\\psi}_{m,n} e^{i(k_m x_j + k_n y_k)}$$\n$$q(x_j, y_k) = \\sum_{m,n} \\hat{q}_{m,n} e^{i(k_m x_j + k_n y_k)}$$\nwhere $k_m = 2\\pi m / L_x$ and $k_n = 2\\pi n / L_y$ are the discrete wavenumbers. The key property of Fourier series is that differentiation becomes multiplication in spectral space. Specifically, the Laplacian operator $\\nabla^2$ transforms to multiplication by $-(k_m^2 + k_n^2)$.\n\nApplying the Fourier transform to the PV inversion equation gives:\n$$\\hat{q}_{m,n} = -(k_m^2 + k_n^2) \\hat{\\psi}_{m,n} - \\frac{1}{L_D^2} \\hat{\\psi}_{m,n} = -\\left(k_m^2 + k_n^2 + \\frac{1}{L_D^2}\\right) \\hat{\\psi}_{m,n}$$\nWe can solve for the spectral coefficients of the streamfunction, $\\hat{\\psi}_{m,n}$:\n$$\\hat{\\psi}_{m,n} = -\\frac{\\hat{q}_{m,n}}{k_m^2 + k_n^2 + 1/L_D^2}$$\nFor the zero-wavenumber mode ($m=0, n=0$), the physical streamfunction is arbitrary (it corresponds to a spatially constant pressure field which generates no flow). We can set $\\hat{\\psi}_{0,0} = 0$. This requires that the domain-averaged PV anomaly must also be zero, $\\hat{q}_{0,0}=0$, for the Poisson case ($L_D \\rightarrow \\infty$) to have a solution. The provided test cases with periodic functions have zero mean, satisfying this condition.\n\nThe numerical algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Compute the 2D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the gridded PV anomaly field $q$ to obtain $\\hat{q}$.\n2.  On a grid of wavenumbers $(k_m, k_n)$, calculate the spectral coefficients $\\hat{\\psi}$ using the algebraic relation above. A division-by-zero for the $(0,0)$ wavenumber in the Poisson case is avoided by setting $\\hat{\\psi}_{0,0}=0$.\n3.  Compute the 2D inverse FFT of $\\hat{\\psi}$ to recover the gridded streamfunction field $\\psi_{\\text{num}}$.\n\n#### Method 2: Finite-Difference Inversion on a Bounded Domain\n\nFor a rectangular domain $[0, L_x] \\times [0, L_y]$ with specified boundary conditions, we use a finite-difference method. The domain is discretized into a uniform grid with $N_x \\times N_y$ points, with grid spacings $\\Delta x = L_x / (N_x-1)$ and $\\Delta y = L_y / (N_y-1)$. Let $\\psi_{i,j}$ denote the value of $\\psi$ at grid point $(x_i, y_j)$.\n\nThe Laplacian operator is approximated using a second-order accurate five-point stencil:\n$$\\nabla^2\\psi \\bigg|_{(i,j)} \\approx \\frac{\\psi_{i+1,j} - 2\\psi_{i,j} + \\psi_{i-1,j}}{(\\Delta x)^2} + \\frac{\\psi_{i,j+1} - 2\\psi_{i,j} + \\psi_{i,j-1}}{(\\Delta y)^2}$$\nSubstituting this into the PV inversion equation for each interior grid point ($1 \\le i \\le N_x-2$, $1 \\le j \\le N_y-2$) gives a system of linear algebraic equations:\n$$\\frac{\\psi_{i+1,j} + \\psi_{i-1,j}}{(\\Delta x)^2} + \\frac{\\psi_{i,j+1} + \\psi_{i,j-1}}{(\\Delta y)^2} - \\left(\\frac{2}{(\\Delta x)^2} + \\frac{2}{(\\Delta y)^2} + \\frac{1}{L_D^2}\\right)\\psi_{i,j} = q_{i,j}$$\nThe problem specifies homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, $\\psi=0$ on all boundaries. This means $\\psi_{i,j}=0$ if $i=0, i=N_x-1, j=0,$ or $j=N_y-1$. These known values are incorporated into the equations for the interior points adjacent to the boundary.\n\nThis system of $(N_x-2) \\times (N_y-2)$ equations can be written in the matrix form $A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$, where:\n- $\\mathbf{x}$ is a vector of the unknown interior values $\\psi_{i,j}$, flattened into a 1D array of length $(N_x-2)(N_y-2)$.\n- $\\mathbf{b}$ is a vector of the known interior values $q_{i,j}$, similarly flattened.\n- $A$ is a large, sparse, block-tridiagonal matrix representing the discretized Helmholtz operator.\n\nThe numerical algorithm is:\n1.  Construct the sparse matrix $A$ representing the finite-difference operator for the interior grid points.\n2.  Construct the right-hand-side vector $\\mathbf{b}$ from the interior values of the $q$ field.\n3.  Solve the linear system $A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$ for $\\mathbf{x}$ using an efficient sparse linear algebra solver.\n4.  Reshape the solution vector $\\mathbf{x}$ back into a 2D array of interior $\\psi$ values and embed it within a larger grid with the zero-valued boundaries to form the full field $\\psi_{\\text{num}}$.\n\n### Part 3: Verification and Test Cases\n\nThe numerical solvers are validated using the Method of Manufactured Solutions. For each test case, an analytical \"truth\" field, $\\psi_{\\text{true}}$, is defined. The corresponding PV anomaly field, $q_{\\text{true}}$, is computed analytically by applying the continuous operator $q = (\\nabla^2 - 1/L_D^2)\\psi$. This $q_{\\text{true}}$ field is then used as input to the numerical inverter to produce $\\psi_{\\text{num}}$. The accuracy of the numerical method is quantified by the Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE), $E = \\sqrt{\\langle(\\psi_{\\text{num}} - \\psi_{\\text{true}})^2\\rangle}$, where the average $\\langle\\cdot\\rangle$ is taken over all grid points. This procedure isolates the numerical error of the inversion process itself. The chosen $\\psi_{\\text{true}}$ functions are eigenfunctions of the respective operators and boundary conditions, providing ideal test scenarios.",
