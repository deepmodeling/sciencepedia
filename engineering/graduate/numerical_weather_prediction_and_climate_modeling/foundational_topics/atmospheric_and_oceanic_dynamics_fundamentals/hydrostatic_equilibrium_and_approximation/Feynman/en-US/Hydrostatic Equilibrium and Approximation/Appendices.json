All necessary parameters and conditions are provided for a unique and meaningful solution. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of $g(z)$\n\nAccording to Newton's law of universal gravitation, the gravitational force $F$ exerted by a spherically symmetric Earth of mass $M$ on an air parcel of mass $m$ at a distance $r$ from the center of the Earth is given by:\n$$\nF = G \\frac{M m}{r^2}\n$$\nwhere $G$ is the gravitational constant. The gravitational acceleration $g$ is the force per unit mass, $g = F/m$. The distance from the center is $r = R+z$, where $R$ is the Earth's radius and $z$ is the altitude above the surface. Thus, the gravitational acceleration as a function of altitude, $g(z)$, is:\n$$\ng(z) = \\frac{GM}{(R+z)^2}\n$$\nAt the surface ($z=0$), the gravitational acceleration is denoted as $g_0$:\n$$\ng_0 = g(0) = \\frac{GM}{R^2}\n$$\nFrom this expression, we can write the product $GM$ as $GM = g_0 R^2$. Substituting this back into the expression for $g(z)$, we obtain the variation of gravitational acceleration in terms of $g_0$, $R$, and $z$:\n$$\ng(z) = \\frac{g_0 R^2}{(R+z)^2} = g_0 \\left( \\frac{R}{R+z} \\right)^2\n$$\n\nPart 2: Derivation of Hydrostatic Pressure Profiles $p(z)$\n\nThe hydrostatic balance equation relates the vertical change in pressure $p$ to the local air density $\\rho$ and gravitational acceleration $g$:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dz} = -\\rho g(z)\n$$\nThe Ideal Gas Law for dry air relates pressure, density, and temperature $T$ via the specific gas constant for dry air, $R_d$:\n$$\np = \\rho R_d T\n$$\nAssuming an isothermal troposphere, $T$ is constant. We can express density in terms of pressure: $\\rho = \\frac{p}{R_d T}$. Substituting this into the hydrostatic equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dz} = -\\frac{p}{R_d T} g(z)\n$$\nThis is a first-order separable differential equation for $p(z)$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{p} dp = -\\frac{g(z)}{R_d T} dz\n$$\nWe integrate this equation from the surface (altitude $z=0$, pressure $p=p_0$) to an arbitrary altitude $z$ where the pressure is $p(z)$:\n$$\n\\int_{p_0}^{p(z)} \\frac{dp'}{p'} = -\\frac{1}{R_d T} \\int_0^z g(z') dz'\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{p(z)}{p_0}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{R_d T} \\int_0^z g(z') dz'\n$$\n$$\np(z) = p_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{R_d T} \\int_0^z g(z') dz'\\right)\n$$\nWe now evaluate this expression for the two specified cases for $g(z)$.\n\nCase A: Variable $g(z)$\nWe use the expression $g(z) = g_0 \\left( \\frac{R}{R+z} \\right)^2$. The integral becomes:\n$$\n\\int_0^z g(z') dz' = \\int_0^z g_0 \\left( \\frac{R}{R+z'} \\right)^2 dz' = g_0 R^2 \\int_0^z (R+z')^{-2} dz'\n$$\nEvaluating the integral:\n$$\n\\int_0^z (R+z')^{-2} dz' = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{R+z'} \\right]_0^z = \\left(-\\frac{1}{R+z}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{R}\\right) = \\frac{1}{R} - \\frac{1}{R+z} = \\frac{(R+z)-R}{R(R+z)} = \\frac{z}{R(R+z)}\n$$\nSo, the full integral of $g(z')$ is:\n$$\n\\int_0^z g(z') dz' = g_0 R^2 \\left( \\frac{z}{R(R+z)} \\right) = \\frac{g_0 R z}{R+z}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the general pressure formula gives the pressure profile for variable $g$:\n$$\np_{\\text{var-}g}(z) = p_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{g_0 R z}{R_d T (R+z)}\\right)\n$$\n\nCase B: Constant $g=g_0$\nIn this approximation, the integral of $g(z')$ simplifies to:\n$$\n\\int_0^z g_0 dz' = g_0 z\n$$\nSubstituting this into the general pressure formula gives the pressure profile for constant $g$:\n$$\np_{\\text{const-}g}(z) = p_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{g_0 z}{R_d T}\\right)\n$$\n\nPart 3: Evaluation of $\\Delta(z)$\n\nThe fractional difference $\\Delta(z)$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\Delta(z) \\equiv \\frac{p_{\\text{var-}g}(z)}{p_{\\text{const-}g}(z)} - 1\n$$\nWe substitute the derived pressure profiles:\n$$\n\\frac{p_{\\text{var-}g}(z)}{p_{\\text{const-}g}(z)} = \\frac{p_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{g_0 R z}{R_d T (R+z)}\\right)}{p_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{g_0 z}{R_d T}\\right)}\n$$\nUsing the property $\\exp(a)/\\exp(b) = \\exp(a-b)$, the ratio becomes:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{g_0 R z}{R_d T (R+z)} + \\frac{g_0 z}{R_d T}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{g_0 z}{R_d T} \\left(1 - \\frac{R}{R+z}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nSimplifying the term in the parentheses:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{R}{R+z} = \\frac{(R+z) - R}{R+z} = \\frac{z}{R+z}\n$$\nThus, the pressure ratio is:\n$$\n\\frac{p_{\\text{var-}g}(z)}{p_{\\text{const-}g}(z)} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{g_0 z^2}{R_d T (R+z)}\\right)\n$$\nAnd the fractional difference $\\Delta(z)$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta(z) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{g_0 z^2}{R_d T (R+z)}\\right) - 1\n$$\nNow we evaluate this expression numerically at $z = 11\\,\\mathrm{km}$ using the given parameters:\n$z = 11\\,\\mathrm{km} = 11 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$R = 6.371 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$g_0 = 9.80665\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$\n$R_d = 287.0\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n$T = 260\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n\nFirst, calculate the exponent of the exponential term:\n$$\nE = \\frac{g_0 z^2}{R_d T (R+z)} = \\frac{(9.80665) \\times (11 \\times 10^3)^2}{(287.0) \\times (260) \\times (6.371 \\times 10^6 + 11 \\times 10^3)}\n$$\n$$\nE = \\frac{9.80665 \\times 1.21 \\times 10^8}{287.0 \\times 260 \\times (6.382 \\times 10^6)} = \\frac{1.18660465 \\times 10^9}{74620 \\times 6.382 \\times 10^6} = \\frac{1.18660465 \\times 10^9}{4.7619124 \\times 10^{11}}\n$$\n$$\nE \\approx 0.0024918530\n$$\nNow, compute $\\Delta(11\\,\\mathrm{km})$:\n$$\n\\Delta(11\\,\\mathrm{km}) = \\exp(E) - 1 = \\exp(0.0024918530) - 1\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta(11\\,\\mathrm{km}) \\approx 1.002494960 - 1 = 0.002494960\n$$\nRounding to six significant figures, the result is $0.00249496$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a nondimensional parameter governing the validity of the hydrostatic approximation in a stratified fluid, its calculation for typical atmospheric conditions, and an assessment based on its value.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Nondimensional Parameter**\n\nWe begin with the linearized, inviscid Boussinesq equations for small-amplitude perturbations (denoted by primes) in a two-dimensional ($x, z$) plane, on a motionless background state with constant buoyancy frequency $N$.\nThe governing equations are:\nVertical momentum:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial w'}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0}\\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial z} + b' $$\nHorizontal momentum:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0}\\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial x} $$\nMass continuity (incompressible):\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial w'}{\\partial z} = 0 $$\nBuoyancy conservation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial b'}{\\partial t} + w'N^2 = 0 $$\nwhere $u'$ and $w'$ are the horizontal and vertical velocity perturbations, $p'$ is the pressure perturbation from the hydrostatic background, $b'$ is the buoyancy perturbation ($b' = -g\\rho'/\\rho_0$), and $\\rho_0$ is a constant reference density.\n\nWe seek plane wave solutions of the form $\\exp(i(kx + mz - \\omega t))$, where $k$ is the horizontal wavenumber, $m$ is the vertical wavenumber, and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency. Substituting this form into the governing equations yields the algebraic system:\n$$ -i\\omega w' = -im\\frac{p'}{\\rho_0} + b' $$\n$$ -i\\omega u' = -ik\\frac{p'}{\\rho_0} $$\n$$ iku' + imw' = 0 $$\n$$ -i\\omega b' + N^2 w' = 0 $$\nFrom the last equation, we express buoyancy in terms of vertical velocity: $b' = -\\frac{iN^2}{\\omega}w'$. Substituting this into the vertical momentum equation gives:\n$$ -i\\omega w' = -im\\frac{p'}{\\rho_0} - \\frac{iN^2}{\\omega}w' $$\n$$ \\left(N^2 - \\omega^2\\right)w' = -m\\omega\\frac{p'}{\\rho_0} $$\nFrom the horizontal momentum and continuity equations, we find $p' = \\frac{\\rho_0 \\omega}{k}u'$ and $u' = -\\frac{m}{k}w'$. Combining these gives $p' = -\\frac{\\rho_0 \\omega m}{k^2}w'$. Substituting this expression for $p'$ into the rearranged vertical momentum equation yields:\n$$ \\left(N^2 - \\omega^2\\right)w' = -m\\omega\\left(-\\frac{m\\omega}{k^2} w'\\right) $$\n$$ N^2 - \\omega^2 = \\frac{m^2\\omega^2}{k^2} $$\nSolving for $\\omega^2$ gives the dispersion relation for internal gravity waves:\n$$ \\omega^2 = \\frac{N^2 k^2}{k^2 + m^2} $$\nThe horizontal phase speed of these waves is $c_p = \\omega/k$. Squaring this gives:\n$$ c_p^2 = \\frac{\\omega^2}{k^2} = \\frac{N^2}{k^2 + m^2} $$\nThe problem asks for a \"hydrostatic long-wave phase speed scale\". The hydrostatic approximation is valid when the vertical acceleration term in the vertical momentum equation is negligible. In the context of waves, this corresponds to low-frequency motions, $\\omega^2 \\ll N^2$. From the dispersion relation, this requires $k^2 \\ll k^2 + m^2$, which simplifies to $k^2 \\ll m^2$. This is the \"long-wave\" limit, where the horizontal wavelength ($2\\pi/k$) is much larger than the vertical wavelength ($2\\pi/m$).\n\nIn this hydrostatic limit ($k^2 \\ll m^2$), the phase speed squared becomes:\n$$ c_p^2 \\approx \\frac{N^2}{m^2} $$\nThe problem specifies that the dominant vertical scale of variability is the tropospheric depth, $H$. This implies a characteristic vertical wavenumber $m \\sim 1/H$. For the gravest vertical mode that fits within the depth $H$, the specific relationship is $m = \\pi/H$, but for a scale analysis, we use $m \\sim 1/H$.\nSubstituting this scale for $m$ gives the hydrostatic phase speed *scale*, which we denote $C_h$:\n$$ C_h^2 \\sim \\frac{N^2}{(1/H)^2} = N^2 H^2 $$\n$$ C_h \\sim NH $$\nThis scale, $NH$, represents the maximum possible speed for long internal gravity waves confined to a layer of depth $H$.\n\nThe problem asks for a nondimensional parameter that compares the characteristic advective speed $U$ to this hydrostatic wave speed $C_h$. This parameter, which we will call $\\Pi$, is the ratio:\n$$ \\Pi = \\frac{U}{C_h} = \\frac{U}{NH} $$\nThe validity of the hydrostatic approximation is controlled by the magnitude of $\\Pi$. The approximation holds when the advective speed is much smaller than the characteristic internal wave speed, i.e., $\\Pi \\ll 1$. This parameter is related to the internal Froude number for a system with vertical scale $H$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Parameter**\n\nWe are given the following typical midlatitude tropospheric values:\nCharacteristic horizontal flow speed: $U = 12 \\ \\mathrm{m \\ s^{-1}}$\nTropospheric depth: $H = 9.0 \\ \\mathrm{km} = 9.0 \\times 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{m}$\nBrunt–Väisälä frequency: $N = 0.012 \\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n\nWe compute the value of the nondimensional parameter $\\Pi$:\n$$ \\Pi = \\frac{U}{NH} = \\frac{12 \\ \\mathrm{m \\ s^{-1}}}{(0.012 \\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}) \\times (9.0 \\times 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{m})} $$\nFirst, we calculate the denominator, which is the hydrostatic wave speed scale $C_h$:\n$$ C_h = NH = (0.012) \\times (9000) \\ \\mathrm{m \\ s^{-1}} = 108 \\ \\mathrm{m \\ s^{-1}} $$\nNow, we compute the ratio:\n$$ \\Pi = \\frac{12}{108} = \\frac{1}{9} $$\nAs a decimal, this is approximately $0.11111...$. Rounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$ \\Pi \\approx 0.111 $$\n\n**Part 3: Assessment of the Hydrostatic Approximation**\n\nThe validity of the hydrostatic approximation is conditioned on the smallness of the ratio of vertical fluid acceleration to the dominant terms in the vertical momentum balance (pressure gradient and buoyancy). Our derivation shows this is controlled by the parameter $\\Pi = U/(NH)$. A more rigorous scaling analysis shows that the ratio of the vertical acceleration term to the buoyancy term scales as $(U/(NL))^2$, where $L$ is the horizontal length scale. The hydrostatic approximation breaks down for motions with small aspect ratios, where $L$ is not much larger than $H$. For the critical case where $L \\sim H$, this ratio of forces becomes $(U/(NH))^2 = \\Pi^2$.\n\nThe hydrostatic approximation is considered valid if this ratio is much less than unity, $\\Pi^2 \\ll 1$, which is equivalent to $\\Pi \\ll 1$.\nOur calculated value is $\\Pi \\approx 0.111$.\nSince $0.111$ is significantly smaller than $1$ (roughly one order of magnitude smaller), we can conclude that $\\Pi \\ll 1$. This implies that for synoptic-scale motions with the given characteristics, the advective speed $U$ is slow compared to the speed at which the atmosphere can adjust vertically via internal gravity waves. Consequently, vertical accelerations are small compared to the gravitational-buoyancy forces, and the atmosphere remains close to hydrostatic equilibrium. Therefore, the hydrostatic approximation is valid for these conditions.",

The air contains a suspended population of hydrometeors (rain drops and graupel) whose collective effect on the air momentum is often summarized as precipitation loading. In reality, precipitation loading introduces a transient nonhydrostatic signal because the air must support the hydrometeor weight via pressure gradients while the hydrometeors fall relative to the air.\n\nStarting from first principles appropriate to geophysical fluid dynamics, namely Newton’s Second Law applied to a control volume of moist air coupled to hydrometeors, and the definition of hydrostatic equilibrium as the state in which the vertical pressure gradient force balances the weight of the air, qualitatively explain why precipitation loading produces a downward acceleration on the air and constitutes a source of departure from hydrostatic balance during convective downdrafts.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of geophysical fluid dynamics, well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient data, and formally structured. The problem will be solved as stated.\n\nThe solution process involves two parts: a qualitative explanation based on first principles and a quantitative derivation followed by a numerical calculation.\n\nWe begin by applying Newton's Second Law to a control volume $V$ of the atmosphere containing a mixture of air and hydrometeors. Let the vertical coordinate be $z$, with the upward direction being positive.\n\nFirst, consider the forces acting on the hydrometeors within the control volume $V$. The mass of the hydrometeors is $m_h = W_h V$, where $W_h$ is the hydrometeor mass concentration. The forces are:\n$1$. The force of gravity, $F_{g,h} = -m_h g \\hat{k} = -W_h V g \\hat{k}$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity and $\\hat{k}$ is the unit vector in the positive $z$ direction.\n$2$. The drag force exerted by the air on the hydrometeors, $F_D$. This force opposes the relative motion of the hydrometeors through the air. Since the hydrometeors are falling, this force is directed upward: $F_D = |F_D| \\hat{k}$.\n\nThe problem states that the hydrometeors have reached their terminal fall speeds, which means their acceleration is zero. Applying Newton's Second Law to the hydrometeors:\n$$ \\sum F_h = m_h a_h = 0 $$\n$$ F_D + F_{g,h} = 0 $$\n$$ |F_D| \\hat{k} - W_h V g \\hat{k} = 0 $$\n$$ |F_D| = W_h V g $$\nThis result indicates that the upward drag force exerted by the air on the hydrometeors exactly balances the weight of the hydrometeors.\n\nNext, we consider the forces acting on the air within the same control volume $V$. The mass of the air is $m_a = \\rho V$, where $\\rho$ is the air density. The forces are:\n$1$. The force of gravity on the air, $F_{g,a} = -m_a g \\hat{k} = -\\rho V g \\hat{k}$.\n$2$. The net force due to the vertical pressure gradient, $F_p = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} V \\hat{k}$, where $p$ is the atmospheric pressure.\n$3$. The force exerted by the hydrometeors on the air. By Newton's Third Law, this force is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the drag force $F_D$ exerted by the air on the hydrometeors. Let's call this force $F_{load}$.\n$$ F_{load} = -F_D = -|F_D| \\hat{k} = -W_h V g \\hat{k} $$\nThis downward force is known as \"precipitation loading.\"\n\nNow, we apply Newton's Second Law to the air parcel to find its vertical acceleration, $a_z$.\n$$ \\sum F_a = m_a a_z = (\\rho V) a_z \\hat{k} $$\n$$ F_p + F_{g,a} + F_{load} = \\rho V a_z \\hat{k} $$\n$$ \\left(-\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} V\\right) \\hat{k} + (-\\rho V g) \\hat{k} + (-W_h V g) \\hat{k} = \\rho V a_z \\hat{k} $$\nDividing by the volume $V$ and considering only the magnitudes in the vertical direction, we obtain the vertical momentum equation for the air:\n$$ \\rho a_z = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} - \\rho g - W_h g $$\n\nQualitative Explanation:\nHydrostatic equilibrium is defined as the state where the vertical pressure gradient force exactly balances the weight of the air, i.e., $-\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} = \\rho g$, resulting in zero vertical acceleration for the air.\nOur derived momentum equation for the air can be rearranged as:\n$$ \\rho a_z = \\left(-\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} - \\rho g\\right) - W_h g $$\nThe term in parentheses represents the net force on the air if it were in a hydrostatic environment without precipitation. The term $-W_h g$ is the precipitation loading term. It represents the downward force per unit volume exerted by the falling hydrometeors on the air. To keep the hydrometeors from accelerating downwards (i.e., to maintain their terminal velocity), the air must provide an upward supporting drag force. Per Newton's Third Law, the hydrometeors exert an equal and opposite downward force on the air. This additional downward force on the air is equivalent to adding mass to the air parcel. This added \"weight\" from precipitation loading breaks the hydrostatic balance. It acts as a net downward force, causing a downward acceleration of the air parcel ($a_z  0$), thus driving a convective downdraft. This term, $-W_h g$, is therefore a source of departure from hydrostatic balance.\n\nQuantitative Derivation and Calculation:\nThe problem asks for the precipitation-loading-induced downward acceleration, $a_p$. This acceleration is the component of the total acceleration $a_z$ that is directly caused by the precipitation loading force. From the momentum equation, the force per unit volume from loading is $-W_h g$. Applying Newton's Second Law to the air mass per unit volume, $\\rho$, we can isolate the acceleration $a_p$ due to this force. Let $a_p$ be the magnitude of the downward acceleration. The acceleration vector is $-a_p \\hat{k}$.\n$$ \\text{Force per volume} = (\\text{mass per volume}) \\times \\text{acceleration} $$\n$$ -W_h g \\hat{k} = \\rho (-a_p \\hat{k}) $$\n$$ W_h g = \\rho a_p $$\nSolving for the magnitude of the acceleration $a_p$:\n$$ a_p = \\frac{W_h}{\\rho} g $$\nThe problem asks for the dimensionless ratio $\\varepsilon = \\frac{a_p}{g}$.\n$$ \\varepsilon = \\frac{a_p}{g} = \\frac{W_h}{\\rho} $$\nThis expression shows that the relative magnitude of the precipitation-loading acceleration is the ratio of the hydrometeor mass concentration to the air density. This is a form of mass mixing ratio.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $\\varepsilon$ using the provided data:\n- Hydrometeor mass concentration, $W_h = 7.2 \\, \\text{g m}^{-3}$\n- Air density, $\\rho = 0.9 \\, \\text{kg m}^{-3}$\n\nWe must use consistent units. We convert $W_h$ to kilograms per cubic meter:\n$$ W_h = 7.2 \\, \\text{g m}^{-3} = 7.2 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{kg m}^{-3} $$\nNow we can compute the dimensionless ratio $\\varepsilon$:\n$$ \\varepsilon = \\frac{W_h}{\\rho} = \\frac{7.2 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{kg m}^{-3}}{0.9 \\, \\text{kg m}^{-3}} $$\n$$ \\varepsilon = \\frac{7.2}{0.9} \\times 10^{-3} $$\n$$ \\varepsilon = 8 \\times 10^{-3} = 0.008 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\varepsilon = 0.008000 $$",
