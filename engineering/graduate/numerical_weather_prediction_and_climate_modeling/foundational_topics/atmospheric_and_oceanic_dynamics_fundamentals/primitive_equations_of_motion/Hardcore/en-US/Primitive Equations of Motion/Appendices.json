To make the equations more tractable, we often employ the 'shallow atmosphere' approximation, which assumes the atmospheric depth is negligible compared to the Earth's radius.

            "problem": "Consider the spherical geometry underlying the primitive equations of motion used in numerical weather prediction and climate modeling. Let the Earth be approximated as a sphere of mean radius $a$, and let the geopotential height coordinate $z$ measure altitude above the spherical surface so that the radial distance from Earth’s center is $r = a + z$. The exact horizontal metric coefficients for longitude and latitude on a sphere of radius $r$ are $h_{\\lambda} = r \\cos \\phi$ and $h_{\\phi} = r$, where $\\lambda$ is longitude and $\\phi$ is latitude. The shallow atmosphere approximation neglects the dependence of these metric coefficients on $z$ by replacing $r$ with $a$ throughout the horizontal geometric factors. Starting from the geometry of spherical coordinates and standard definitions of metric coefficients, derive a dimensionless expression for the maximum relative error incurred in the horizontal area factor by neglecting the vertical variation of $r$ over a finite atmospheric depth $H$. Then evaluate this maximum relative error for a realistic atmosphere with $H = 20\\,\\mathrm{km}$ and Earth’s mean radius $a = 6.371 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$. Express your final answer as a decimal fraction and round your answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a dimensionless expression for the maximum relative error in the horizontal area factor on a sphere when the shallow atmosphere approximation is employed, and then to evaluate this error for given parameters.\n\nFirst, we establish the geometry of the system. In a spherical coordinate system with longitude $\\lambda$, latitude $\\phi$, and radial distance $r$, the differential line elements in the horizontal directions (longitude and latitude) are given by $dl_{\\lambda} = h_{\\lambda} d\\lambda$ and $dl_{\\phi} = h_{\\phi} d\\phi$, where $h_{\\lambda}$ and $h_{\\phi}$ are the metric coefficients. As stated in the problem, the exact metric coefficients are $h_{\\lambda} = r \\cos \\phi$ and $h_{\\phi} = r$.\n\nThe differential horizontal area element $dA$ is the product of these two line elements:\n$$dA = dl_{\\lambda} dl_{\\phi} = (h_{\\lambda} d\\lambda) (h_{\\phi} d\\phi) = (h_{\\lambda} h_{\\phi}) d\\lambda d\\phi$$\nThe term $J = h_{\\lambda} h_{\\phi}$ is the horizontal area factor, which represents the local scaling of the area element relative to the coordinate differentials.\n\nThe exact horizontal area factor, which we denote as $J_{exact}$, uses the full radial dependence $r = a + z$, where $a$ is the Earth's mean radius and $z$ is the geopotential height.\n$$J_{exact}(z, \\phi) = (r \\cos \\phi)(r) = r^2 \\cos \\phi = (a+z)^2 \\cos \\phi$$\n\nThe shallow atmosphere approximation simplifies the equations by neglecting the vertical variation of the metric coefficients. This is achieved by replacing the variable radial distance $r$ with the constant mean radius $a$. The approximate horizontal area factor, denoted as $J_{approx}$, is therefore:\n$$J_{approx}(\\phi) = (a \\cos \\phi)(a) = a^2 \\cos \\phi$$\n\nThe relative error, $\\epsilon$, incurred by this approximation is defined as the absolute difference between the exact and approximate values, divided by the exact value:\n$$\\epsilon(z, \\phi) = \\frac{|J_{exact} - J_{approx}|}{J_{exact}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $J_{exact}$ and $J_{approx}$:\n$$\\epsilon(z, \\phi) = \\frac{|(a+z)^2 \\cos \\phi - a^2 \\cos \\phi|}{(a+z)^2 \\cos \\phi}$$\nFor any location not at the poles, $\\phi \\neq \\pm \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, so $\\cos \\phi \\neq 0$ and we can simplify the expression. We assume we are not at the poles, as the area element itself vanishes there. Since $z \\ge 0$ for atmospheric height, it follows that $(a+z)^2 \\ge a^2$. Thus, the term inside the absolute value is non-negative, and $\\cos \\phi  0$ for latitudes between the poles. The expression for the relative error becomes:\n$$\\epsilon(z) = \\frac{[(a+z)^2 - a^2]\\cos \\phi}{(a+z)^2 \\cos \\phi} = \\frac{(a+z)^2 - a^2}{(a+z)^2} = 1 - \\frac{a^2}{(a+z)^2}$$\nNotably, the relative error in the area factor is independent of latitude $\\phi$.\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum relative error over a finite atmospheric depth $H$. This means we need to find the maximum value of $\\epsilon(z)$ for $z \\in [0, H]$. To do this, we examine the derivative of $\\epsilon(z)$ with respect to $z$:\n$$\\frac{d\\epsilon}{dz} = \\frac{d}{dz} \\left(1 - a^2(a+z)^{-2}\\right) = -a^2 (-2)(a+z)^{-3} (1) = \\frac{2a^2}{(a+z)^3}$$\nSince both the radius $a$ and height $z$ are positive quantities, the derivative $\\frac{d\\epsilon}{dz}$ is always positive for $z \\ge 0$. This indicates that $\\epsilon(z)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $z$. Consequently, the maximum error will occur at the maximum height, $z=H$.\n\nThe dimensionless expression for the maximum relative error, $\\epsilon_{max}$, is obtained by substituting $z=H$ into the expression for $\\epsilon(z)$:\n$$\\epsilon_{max} = \\epsilon(H) = 1 - \\frac{a^2}{(a+H)^2}$$\nThis expression can be rewritten by finding a common denominator:\n$$\\epsilon_{max} = \\frac{(a+H)^2 - a^2}{(a+H)^2} = \\frac{a^2 + 2aH + H^2 - a^2}{(a+H)^2} = \\frac{2aH + H^2}{(a+H)^2}$$\nFactoring out $H$ in the numerator gives another form:\n$$\\epsilon_{max} = \\frac{H(2a+H)}{(a+H)^2}$$\nAny of these forms represents the derived dimensionless expression for the maximum relative error.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression for the given values:\nAtmospheric depth $H = 20\\,\\mathrm{km} = 20 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{m} = 2 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\nEarth's mean radius $a = 6.371 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nUsing the expression $\\epsilon_{max} = 1 - \\frac{a^2}{(a+H)^2} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{a}{a+H}\\right)^2$:\n$$\\epsilon_{max} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{6.371 \\times 10^6}{6.371 \\times 10^6 + 2 \\times 10^4}\\right)^2$$\n$$\\epsilon_{max} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{6.371 \\times 10^6}{6.391 \\times 10^6}\\right)^2 = 1 - \\left(\\frac{6.371}{6.391}\\right)^2$$\nNow, we perform the calculation:\n$$\\frac{6.371}{6.391} \\approx 0.99687060$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{6.371}{6.391}\\right)^2 \\approx (0.99687060)^2 \\approx 0.99375095$$\n$$\\epsilon_{max} \\approx 1 - 0.99375095 = 0.00624905$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

The digit following the third significant figure is $9$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the last significant digit.\n$$0.00624905 \\approx 0.00625$$\nThis is the maximum relative error, expressed as a decimal fraction.",

Let $U$, $L$, $H$, and $W$ represent the characteristic scales for horizontal velocity, horizontal length, vertical length, and vertical velocity, respectively.

The provided scales are:\n- Horizontal velocity scale: $U = 18 \\ \\mathrm{m} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- Horizontal length scale: $L = 1.2 \\times 10^{6} \\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- Vertical length scale: $H = 7.0 \\times 10^{3} \\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- Coriolis parameter: $f = 1.1 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we analyze the denominator term, the Coriolis acceleration, $f \\,\\hat{\\boldsymbol{k}} \\times \\boldsymbol{u}_{h}$.

This angle is $\\pi/2$, so $\\sin(\\pi/2)=1$. The characteristic magnitude of this term is:\n$$\n[f \\,\\hat{\\boldsymbol{k}} \\times \\boldsymbol{u}_{h}] \\sim f U\n$$\n\nNext, we analyze the numerator, which represents the nonlinear advection of horizontal momentum. It consists of two terms.\nThe first term is the horizontal advection of horizontal momentum, $(\\boldsymbol{u}_{h} \\cdot \\nabla_{h}) \\boldsymbol{u}_{h}$. Using scale analysis, the magnitude of the horizontal gradient operator $\\nabla_{h}$ is $1/L$. Thus, the scale of this term is:\n$$\n[(\\boldsymbol{u}_{h} \\cdot \\nabla_{h}) \\boldsymbol{u}_{h}] \\sim [u] \\frac{[\\boldsymbol{u}_{h}]}{[x]} \\sim U \\frac{U}{L} = \\frac{U^2}{L}\n$$\n\nThe second term is the vertical advection of horizontal momentum, $w \\,\\partial \\boldsymbol{u}_{h}/\\partial z$. The scale of the vertical derivative $\\partial/\\partial z$ is $1/H$. The scale of this term is:\n$$\n[w \\,\\partial \\boldsymbol{u}_{h}/\\partial z] \\sim W \\frac{U}{H}\n$$\nTo proceed, we must determine the scale $W$ for the vertical velocity. The problem specifies the use of the Boussinesq continuity equation, which is $\\nabla_{h} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}_{h} + \\partial w/\\partial z = 0$. We perform a scale analysis on this equation:\n$$\n[\\nabla_{h} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}_{h}] + [\\partial w/\\partial z] \\sim 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{U}{L} + \\frac{W}{H} \\sim 0\n$$\nFor these terms to balance, their magnitudes must be of the same order:\n$$\n\\frac{W}{H} \\sim \\frac{U}{L} \\implies W \\sim U \\frac{H}{L}\n$$\nNow we can substitute this scale for $W$ back into the expression for the scale of the vertical advection term:\n$$\n[w \\,\\partial \\boldsymbol{u}_{h}/\\partial z] \\sim \\left(U \\frac{H}{L}\\right) \\frac{U}{H} = \\frac{U^2}{L}\n$$\nWe observe that for synoptic-scale motion, both the horizontal and vertical advection of horizontal momentum have the same characteristic scale, $U^2/L$. The problem asks for the \"combined magnitude\" of these terms. In scale analysis, when two terms contributing to a physical process have the same order of magnitude, the order of magnitude of their sum is taken to be that same order. Therefore, the scale of the total nonlinear advection is:\n$$\n[(\\boldsymbol{u}_{h} \\cdot \\nabla_{h}) \\boldsymbol{u}_{h} + w \\,\\partial \\boldsymbol{u}_{h}/\\partial z] \\sim \\frac{U^2}{L}\n$$\nNow we can construct the non-dimensional ratio $R$ by dividing the scale of the nonlinear advection by the scale of the Coriolis acceleration:\n$$\nR = \\frac{U^2/L}{fU} = \\frac{U}{fL}\n$$\nThis ratio is known as the Rossby number, $Ro$. It is the fundamental parameter that measures the importance of advective inertia relative to the Coriolis force.

The scheme is given by $\\mathbf{X}^{n+1} = \\mathbf{X}^{n-1} + 2 \\Delta t \\mathcal{L} \\mathbf{X}^{n}$. For a linear system, the stability of this scheme is determined by the eigenvalues of the operator $\\mathcal{L}$. The continuous system is $\\frac{d\\mathbf{X}}{dt} = \\mathcal{L}\\mathbf{X}$. Comparing with the plane-wave time dependence $e^{-i\\omega t}$, we see that the eigenvalues of $\\mathcal{L}$ are $\\mu = -i\\omega$, where $\\omega$ are the eigenfrequencies of the continuous system. The eigenvalues of $\\mathcal{L}$ are therefore purely imaginary: $\\mu_j = -i\\omega_j$.\nFor the leapfrog scheme, we seek an amplification factor $\\lambda$ such that $\\mathbf{X}^n = \\lambda^n \\mathbf{X}^0$. Substituting this into the scheme for a single mode gives $\\lambda^2 \\mathbf{X}^0 = \\mathbf{X}^0 + 2 \\Delta t \\mu \\lambda \\mathbf{X}^0$, leading to the characteristic equation for $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\lambda^2 - 2\\Delta t \\mu \\lambda - 1 = 0\n$$\nThe solutions for $\\lambda$ are $\\lambda = \\Delta t \\mu \\pm \\sqrt{(\\Delta t \\mu)^2 + 1}$. For stability, we require $|\\lambda| \\leq 1$ for all modes. Substituting $\\mu = -i\\omega$:\n$$\n\\lambda = -i\\omega\\Delta t \\pm \\sqrt{1 - (\\omega\\Delta t)^2}\n$$\nIf $|\\omega\\Delta t| \\leq 1$, then $1 - (\\omega\\Delta t)^2 \\ge 0$, and the term under the square root is real. The magnitude of $\\lambda$ is then $|\\lambda|^2 = (-\\omega\\Delta t)^2 + (1 - (\\omega\\Delta t)^2) = 1$. The scheme is neutrally stable. If $|\\omega\\Delta t|  1$, the term under the square root is imaginary, yielding one root with $|\\lambda|  1$, which leads to exponential growth and instability.\nThe stability condition is therefore $|\\omega\\Delta t| \\leq 1$ for all frequencies $\\omega$ present in the system. The maximum allowable time step is constrained by the highest frequency:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\leq \\frac{1}{\\max|\\omega|}\n$$\nFor the full inertia-gravity system, the highest frequency magnitude is $\\max|\\omega| = \\sqrt{f^2 + c^2 K^2}$. Thus, the maximum stable time step for the fully explicit scheme is:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{E,max}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{f^2 + c^2 K^2}}\n$$\n\nThird, we analyze the stability of the semi-implicit scheme. The linear operator $\\mathcal{L}$ is split into a Coriolis part $\\mathcal{C}$ and a gravity-wave part $\\mathcal{G}$. The scheme is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathbf{X}^{n+1} - \\mathbf{X}^{n-1}}{2\\Delta t} = \\mathcal{C}\\mathbf{X}^n + \\mathcal{G}\\frac{\\mathbf{X}^{n+1} + \\mathbf{X}^{n-1}}{2}\n$$\nThe term involving $\\mathcal{G}$ is treated implicitly using the Crank-Nicolson method (which is centered in time, matching the leapfrog scheme). The eigenvalues of the gravity wave operator $\\mathcal{G}$ are purely imaginary, $\\mu_{\\mathcal{G}} = 0, \\pm i c K$. The Crank-Nicolson scheme applied to an operator with purely imaginary eigenvalues is unconditionally stable; its amplification factor has a magnitude of exactly $1$ for any time step $\\Delta t$. Therefore, the implicit treatment of the gravity-wave terms imposes no stability restriction on the time step.\nThe stability of the overall semi-implicit scheme is thus limited by the explicit part of the calculation, which is the leapfrog treatment of the Coriolis term $\\mathcal{C}\\mathbf{X}^n$. We must analyze the stability of the leapfrog scheme applied to the system $\\frac{d\\mathbf{X}}{dt} = \\mathcal{C}\\mathbf{X}$. This describes inertial oscillations. The frequencies $\\omega_{\\mathcal{C}}$ of this system are given by the eigenvalues of $-i\\mathcal{C}$. The operator $\\mathcal{C}$ for the Fourier mode is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{C} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  f  0 \\\\ -f  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nIts characteristic equation is $\\det(\\mathcal{C} - \\mu I) = -\\mu(\\mu^2 + f^2) = 0$, giving eigenvalues $\\mu_{\\mathcal{C}} = 0, \\pm if$. The corresponding frequencies are $\\omega_{\\mathcal{C}} = 0, \\pm f$.\nThe leapfrog stability condition for this explicit part is $\\Delta t \\leq \\frac{1}{\\max|\\omega_{\\mathcal{C}}|}$. With $\\max|\\omega_{\\mathcal{C}}| = |f|$, the stability criterion becomes:\n$$\n\\Delta t |f| \\leq 1\n$$\nThus, the maximum stable time step for the semi-implicit scheme is dictated by the Coriolis frequency:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{SI,max}} = \\frac{1}{|f|}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R = \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{SI,max}} / \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{E,max}}$.\n$$\nR = \\frac{1/|f|}{1/\\sqrt{f^2 + c^2 K^2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{f^2 + c^2 K^2}}{|f|}\n$$\nSince $|f|^2 = f^2$, we can write this as:\n$$\nR = \\sqrt{\\frac{f^2 + c^2 K^2}{f^2}} = \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{c^2 K^2}{f^2}}\n$$\nThis ratio quantifies the computational advantage of the semi-implicit scheme, which allows for a much larger time step when the gravity wave speed $c$ or the wavenumber $K$ is large compared to the inertial frequency $f$.",
