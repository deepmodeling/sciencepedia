It is a well-posed, scientifically sound problem from classical wave mechanics. I will proceed to derive the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Analytic Solution\n\nThe problem is to solve the system of PDEs:\n1.  $\\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial t} + \\frac{1}{\\rho_0}\\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial x} = 0$\n2.  $\\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial t} + \\rho_0 c^2 \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial x} = 0$\n\nwith initial conditions:\n$p'(x,0) = p_a \\exp(-x^2 / (2\\sigma^2))$\n$u'(x,0) = 0$\n\nThis system can be decoupled into two standard 1D wave equations. To derive the wave equation for $p'$, we differentiate equation (1) with respect to $x$ and equation (2) with respect to $t$:\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 u'}{\\partial t \\partial x} + \\frac{1}{\\rho_0}\\frac{\\partial^2 p'}{\\partial x^2} = 0$\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 p'}{\\partial t^2} + \\rho_0 c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u'}{\\partial t \\partial x} = 0$\n\nFrom the first differentiated equation, we find $\\frac{\\partial^2 u'}{\\partial t \\partial x} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0}\\frac{\\partial^2 p'}{\\partial x^2}$. Substituting this into the second yields:\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 p'}{\\partial t^2} + \\rho_0 c^2 \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\rho_0}\\frac{\\partial^2 p'}{\\partial x^2}\\right) = 0 \\implies \\frac{\\partial^2 p'}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 p'}{\\partial x^2}$\n\nSimilarly, one can show that $u'$ also satisfies the wave equation: $\\frac{\\partial^2 u'}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u'}{\\partial x^2}$.\n\nThe general solution of the 1D wave equation $\\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial x^2}$ with initial conditions $\\psi(x,0) = f(x)$ and $\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t}(x,0) = g(x)$ is given by d'Alembert's formula:\n$$\n\\psi(x,t) = \\frac{1}{2} [f(x-ct) + f(x+ct)] + \\frac{1}{2c} \\int_{x-ct}^{x+ct} g(\\xi) d\\xi\n$$\n\n**1. Solution for Pressure Perturbation $p'(x,t)$**\n\nThe initial condition for pressure is $p'(x,0) = p_a \\exp(-x^2 / (2\\sigma^2))$.\nWe need the initial time derivative, $\\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial t}(x,0)$. From the governing equation (2):\n$\\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial t}(x,0) = -\\rho_0 c^2 \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial x}(x,0)$.\nSince $u'(x,0) = 0$ for all $x$, its spatial derivative is also zero: $\\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial x}(x,0) = 0$.\nThus, $\\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial t}(x,0) = 0$.\n\nApplying d'Alembert's formula for $p'(x,t)$ with $f(x) = p_a \\exp(-x^2 / (2\\sigma^2))$ and $g(x) = 0$:\n$$\np'(x,t) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ p_a \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x-ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) + p_a \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x+ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\right] + \\frac{1}{2c} \\int_{x-ct}^{x+ct} 0 \\, d\\xi\n$$\n$$\np'(x,t) = \\frac{p_a}{2} \\left[ \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x-ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) + \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x+ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nThis solution describes the initial Gaussian pulse splitting into two identical pulses of half the amplitude, one traveling to the right at speed $c$ and the other to the left at speed $c$.\n\n**2. Solution for Velocity Perturbation $u'(x,t)$**\n\nThe initial condition for velocity is $u'(x,0) = 0$.\nWe need the initial time derivative, $\\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial t}(x,0)$. From the governing equation (1):\n$\\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial t}(x,0) = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial x}(x,0)$.\nFirst, we compute the derivative of the initial pressure:\n$\\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial x}(x,0) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left[ p_a \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\right] = p_a \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\left(-\\frac{2x}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) = -\\frac{p_a x}{\\sigma^2} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$.\nSo, the initial time derivative of velocity is:\n$\\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial t}(x,0) = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\left( -\\frac{p_a x}{\\sigma^2} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{p_a x}{\\rho_0 \\sigma^2} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$.\n\nApplying d'Alembert's formula for $u'(x,t)$ with $f(x) = 0$ and $g(x) = \\frac{p_a x}{\\rho_0 \\sigma^2} \\exp(-x^2 / (2\\sigma^2))$:\n$$\nu'(x,t) = \\frac{1}{2} [0 + 0] + \\frac{1}{2c} \\int_{x-ct}^{x+ct} \\frac{p_a \\xi}{\\rho_0 \\sigma^2} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\xi^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) d\\xi\n$$\nThe integral can be evaluated by recognizing that the integrand is the derivative of a Gaussian function. Let $H(\\xi) = -\\frac{p_a}{\\rho_0} \\exp(-\\xi^2/(2\\sigma^2))$. Then $\\frac{dH}{d\\xi} = -\\frac{p_a}{\\rho_0} \\exp(-\\xi^2/(2\\sigma^2)) \\cdot (-\\frac{2\\xi}{2\\sigma^2}) = \\frac{p_a \\xi}{\\rho_0 \\sigma^2} \\exp(-\\xi^2/(2\\sigma^2))$.\nSo, the integral is:\n$$\n\\int_{x-ct}^{x+ct} g(\\xi) d\\xi = \\left[ -\\frac{p_a}{\\rho_0} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\xi^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\right]_{x-ct}^{x+ct} = -\\frac{p_a}{\\rho_0} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x+ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) - \\left( -\\frac{p_a}{\\rho_0} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x-ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{p_a}{\\rho_0} \\left[ \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x-ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x+ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the solution for $u'(x,t)$:\n$$\nu'(x,t) = \\frac{1}{2c} \\cdot \\frac{p_a}{\\rho_0} \\left[ \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x-ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x+ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nu'(x,t) = \\frac{p_a}{2\\rho_0 c} \\left[ \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x-ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x+ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nThis solution shows that the initially stationary medium is set in motion by the pressure gradients, resulting in two opposing velocity fields associated with the two separating pressure pulses.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nNow I will evaluate each of the given options against the derived solution.\n\n**A.**\n$$\np'(x,t) = \\frac{p_a}{2}\\left[\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x-ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) + \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x+ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\\right],\n$$\n$$\nu'(x,t) = \\frac{p_a}{2\\rho_0 c}\\left[\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x-ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x+ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\\right].\n$$\nThis option perfectly matches both the pressure solution and the velocity solution derived from first principles.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B.**\n$$\np'(x,t) = p_a \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x-ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right), \\qquad u'(x,t) = 0.\n$$\nThis option represents a single rightward-traveling pressure wave with no associated velocity field.\nLet's check the initial conditions. At $t=0$:\n$p'(x,0) = p_a \\exp(-x^2/(2\\sigma^2))$. This matches the given IC for pressure.\n$u'(x,0) = 0$. This matches the given IC for velocity.\nNow, let's check the governing equations. With $u'(x,t)=0$, the first equation becomes $\\frac{1}{\\rho_0}\\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial x} = 0$, implying $p'$ cannot depend on $x$. However, the proposed solution for $p'$ clearly depends on $x$. Thus, the first PDE is violated. The second PDE becomes $\\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial t}=0$, implying $p'$ cannot depend on $t$. This is also contradicted.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C.**\n$$\np'(x,t) = \\frac{p_a}{2}\\left[\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x-ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) + \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x+ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\\right],\n$$\n$$\nu'(x,t) = \\frac{p_a}{2\\rho_0 c}\\left[\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x-ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) + \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x+ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\\right].\n$$\nThe expression for $p'(x,t)$ is correct. Let's check the initial condition for $u'(x,t)$. At $t=0$:\n$u'(x,0) = \\frac{p_a}{2\\rho_0 c}\\left[\\exp(-x^2/(2\\sigma^2)) + \\exp(-x^2/(2\\sigma^2))\\right] = \\frac{p_a}{\\rho_0 c} \\exp(-x^2/(2\\sigma^2))$.\nThis is not equal to the required initial condition $u'(x,0) = 0$.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D.**\n$$\np'(x,t) = p_a \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x^2 + c^2 t^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right), \\qquad u'(x,t) = \\frac{p_a}{\\rho_0 c}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x^2 + c^2 t^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right).\n$$\nThis solution represents a standing wave, not a propagating one. Let's check the initial condition for velocity. At $t=0$:\n$u'(x,0) = \\frac{p_a}{\\rho_0 c}\\exp(-x^2/(2\\sigma^2))$.\nThis is not equal to the required initial condition $u'(x,0)=0$.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of linear acoustics, mathematically well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and objectively formulated. There are no identifiable flaws that would preclude a rigorous solution.\n\nThe problem asks for two distinct calculations: the travel time of an acoustic signal between two points in a moving medium, and an assessment of whether a reflected signal can return to its source within a given time window.\n\nFirst, we compute the ground-relative travel time for an infrasound signal propagating from point $A$ to point $B$. The fundamental principle is that the velocity of the sound wave relative to the ground, $\\mathbf{v}_{s,g}$, is the vector sum of its velocity relative to the medium (air), $\\mathbf{c}$, and the velocity of the medium relative to the ground, $\\mathbf{U}$.\n$$ \\mathbf{v}_{s,g} = \\mathbf{c} + \\mathbf{U} $$\nThe magnitude of the sound velocity in the medium is the speed of sound, $c$. For an ideal gas, this is given by:\n$$ c = \\sqrt{\\gamma R_d T} $$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the ratio of specific heats, $R_d$ is the specific gas constant for dry air, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. Using the provided values: $\\gamma = 1.4$, $R_d = 287 \\,\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$, and $T = 280 \\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n$$ c = \\sqrt{1.4 \\times 287 \\times 280} = \\sqrt{112504} \\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}} \\approx 335.416 \\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}} $$\nThe problem states that the signal propagates from $A$ to $B$ along the $x$-axis, and $B$ is downwind of $A$. The wind velocity is uniform and given as $\\mathbf{U} = U \\,\\hat{\\mathbf{i}}$ with $U = 20 \\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$. Since the propagation is in the direction of the wind (downwind), the sound velocity vector relative to the medium, $\\mathbf{c}$, is also aligned with the $x$-axis: $\\mathbf{c} = c \\,\\hat{\\mathbf{i}}$.\nThe ground-relative velocity is therefore purely in the $x$-direction with a magnitude equal to the sum of the speeds:\n$$ v_{s,g} = c + U $$\nThe distance between points $A$ and $B$ is $D = 300 \\,\\mathrm{km} = 3 \\times 10^5 \\,\\mathrm{m}$. The travel time $t_{AB}$ is the distance divided by the ground-relative speed.\n$$ t_{AB} = \\frac{D}{c+U} $$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$ t_{AB} = \\frac{3 \\times 10^5 \\,\\mathrm{m}}{\\sqrt{112504} \\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}} + 20 \\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}} \\approx \\frac{3 \\times 10^5}{335.416 + 20} \\,\\mathrm{s} \\approx \\frac{3 \\times 10^5}{355.416} \\,\\mathrm{s} \\approx 844.053 \\,\\mathrm{s} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, the travel time is $844.1 \\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nSecond, we assess whether a signal from point $A$ can reflect off a lateral boundary and return to $A$ within the forecast window $\\tau_{f} = 3 \\,\\mathrm{h}$.\nFirst, convert the time window to seconds: $\\tau_{f} = 3 \\,\\mathrm{h} \\times 3600 \\,\\mathrm{s\\,h^{-1}} = 10800 \\,\\mathrm{s}$.\nThe source is at $x_A = 250 \\,\\mathrm{km}$. The lateral boundaries are at $x=0$ and $x=W=600\\,\\mathrm{km}$.\n\nFor a signal emitted from $A$ to return to the same location $(x_A, y_A)$, we must analyze the path. Let the ray velocity vector be $\\mathbf{v}_{ray} = c\\hat{\\mathbf{n}} + \\mathbf{U}$, where $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}$ is the unit vector in the direction of propagation relative to the medium. Let $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}} = \\cos\\phi \\, \\hat{\\mathbf{i}} + \\sin\\phi \\, \\hat{\\mathbf{j}}$. For a specular reflection from a vertical boundary (e.g., at $x=W$), the component of the ray's velocity relative to the medium normal to the boundary is reversed. The velocity of the ray returning from the wall at $W$ would have its propagation vector as $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}' = -\\cos\\phi \\, \\hat{\\mathbf{i}} + \\sin\\phi \\, \\hat{\\mathbf{j}}$.\nThe ground-relative velocity for the outbound path is $\\mathbf{v}_{out} = (c\\cos\\phi + U)\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{i}} + (c\\sin\\phi)\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{j}}$.\nThe ground-relative velocity for the inbound path is $\\mathbf{v}_{in} = (-c\\cos\\phi + U)\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{i}} + (c\\sin\\phi)\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{j}}$.\nFor the signal to return to the same $y$-coordinate, the total vertical displacement must be zero. The total vertical displacement is $\\Delta y = (c\\sin\\phi) t_{out} + (c\\sin\\phi) t_{in} = c\\sin\\phi(t_{out} + t_{in})$. Since the travel times $t_{out}$ and $t_{in}$ are positive, $\\Delta y = 0$ requires $\\sin\\phi = 0$. This implies $\\phi=0$ or $\\phi=\\pi$, meaning the propagation must be entirely along the $x$-axis.\n\nTherefore, we only need to consider paths along the $x$-axis.\nCase 1: Reflection from the boundary at $x=0$.\nThe signal travels from $x_A = 250 \\,\\mathrm{km}$ to $x=0$. This is an upwind path. The distance is $D_{A0} = 250 \\,\\mathrm{km} = 2.5 \\times 10^5 \\,\\mathrm{m}$. The speed is $c-U$. For this to be possible, $c>U$, which is true ($335.416 > 20$).\nThe travel time to the boundary is $t_{A0} = \\frac{D_{A0}}{c-U}$.\nThe signal reflects and travels from $x=0$ to $x_A = 250 \\,\\mathrm{km}$. This is a downwind path. The distance is $D_{0A} = 250 \\,\\mathrm{km}$. The speed is $c+U$.\nThe travel time back to the source is $t_{0A} = \\frac{D_{0A}}{c+U}$.\nThe total round-trip time is $t_{round, 0} = t_{A0} + t_{0A} = \\frac{x_A}{c-U} + \\frac{x_A}{c+U} = x_A \\frac{(c+U)+(c-U)}{(c-U)(c+U)} = \\frac{2cx_A}{c^2-U^2}$.\n$$ t_{round, 0} = \\frac{2(\\sqrt{112504})(2.5 \\times 10^5)}{112504 - 20^2} = \\frac{2(\\sqrt{112504})(2.5 \\times 10^5)}{112104} \\approx 1496.0 \\,\\mathrm{s} $$\n\nCase 2: Reflection from the boundary at $x=W=600\\,\\mathrm{km}$.\nThe signal travels from $x_A = 250 \\,\\mathrm{km}$ to $x=W$.

This problem delves into the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem as it applies to a grid, imposing an upper limit on the wavenumber (and thus a lower limit on the wavelength) that can be resolved. Determining the shortest resolvable wavelength and the corresponding maximum frequency for a given model configuration  is a vital skill for assessing a model's suitability for studying a particular phenomenon and for correctly interpreting its output.",

All data and definitions required for a unique and meaningful solution are provided. The context is a standard, albeit simplified, scenario in numerical atmospheric modeling, based on fundamental principles of wave mechanics and numerical analysis. The problem is therefore valid.\n\n**1) Continuum Dispersion Relation and Shortest Resolvable Wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\min}$)**\n\nThe governing equation for linear acoustic waves is given as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\nabla^2 p\n$$\nIn a two-dimensional Cartesian grid $(x, z)$, the Laplacian operator is $\\nabla^2 = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial z^2} \\right)\n$$\nWe assume a plane-wave ansatz for the solution of the form $p(x, z, t) = p_0 \\exp(i(k_x x + k_z z - \\omega t))$, where $k_x$ and $k_z$ are the wavenumbers in the $x$ and $z$ directions, respectively, and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency.\n\nTo find the continuum dispersion relation, we substitute the ansatz into the wave equation. First, we compute the necessary partial derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial t^2} = (-i\\omega)^2 p = -\\omega^2 p\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial x^2} = (ik_x)^2 p = -k_x^2 p\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial z^2} = (ik_z)^2 p = -k_z^2 p\n$$\nSubstituting these into the wave equation yields:\n$$\n-\\omega^2 p = c^2 (-k_x^2 p - k_z^2 p) = -c^2 (k_x^2 + k_z^2) p\n$$\nDividing by $-p$ (since $p$ is not identically zero), we obtain the continuum dispersion relation:\n$$\n\\omega^2 = c^2 (k_x^2 + k_z^2)\n$$\nAssuming non-negative frequency, $\\omega = c \\sqrt{k_x^2 + k_z^2}$. The magnitude of the total wavevector is $k = \\sqrt{k_x^2 + k_z^2}$, so the relation can be written as $\\omega = c k$.\n\nNext, we determine the shortest resolvable acoustic wavelength, $\\lambda_{\\min}$. According to the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem, a wave is resolvable on a grid with spacing $\\Delta s$ if its wavenumber component lies in the interval $[-\\pi/\\Delta s, \\pi/\\Delta s]$. The maximum representable wavenumber, or Nyquist wavenumber, is $k_N = \\pi/\\Delta s$, corresponding to a wavelength of $2\\Delta s$.\n\nFor the given two-dimensional grid with spacings $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta z$, the maximum representable component wavenumbers are:\n$$\n|k_x|_{\\max} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\Delta x}\n$$\n$$\n|k_z|_{\\max} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\Delta z}\n$$\nThe shortest wavelength $\\lambda_{\\min}$ corresponds to the largest possible magnitude of the total wavevector, $k_{\\max}$. This occurs for a wave whose component wavenumbers are at their maximum values:\n$$\nk_{\\max} = \\sqrt{(|k_x|_{\\max})^2 + (|k_z|_{\\max})^2} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{\\Delta x}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{\\Delta z}\\right)^2} = \\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{(\\Delta x)^2} + \\frac{1}{(\\Delta z)^2}}\n$$\nThe relationship between wavelength $\\lambda$ and wavenumber $k$ is $\\lambda = 2\\pi/k$. Therefore, the shortest resolvable wavelength is:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\min} = \\frac{2\\pi}{k_{\\max}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{(\\Delta x)^2} + \\frac{1}{(\\Delta z)^2}}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{(\\Delta x)^2} + \\frac{1}{(\\Delta z)^2}}}\n$$\nThis is the analytic expression for $\\lambda_{\\min}$ in terms of $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta z$.\n\n**2) Numerical Computations**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n$\\Delta x = 10\\,\\text{km} = 10000\\,\\text{m}$\n$\\Delta z = 0.25\\,\\text{km} = 250\\,\\text{m}$\n$c = 340\\,\\text{m s}^{-1}$\n$\\Delta t_{a} = 0.50\\,\\text{s}$\n\nFirst, we compute $\\lambda_{\\min}$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\min} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{(10000\\,\\text{m})^2} + \\frac{1}{(250\\,\\text{m})^2}}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{1 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\text{m}^{-2} + 1.6 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}}}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\min} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{1.601 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}}} \\approx \\frac{2}{0.00400125\\,\\text{m}^{-1}} \\approx 499.84\\,\\text{m}\n$$\nThe shortest resolvable acoustic wavelength is approximately $499.84\\,\\text{m}$.\n\nNext, we compute the maximum representable acoustic frequency $f_{\\max}$, defined as the minimum of the spatial Nyquist-limited frequency ($f_{\\text{spatial}}$) and the temporal Nyquist frequency ($f_{\\text{temporal}}$).\n\nThe spatial Nyquist-limited frequency is the frequency of the wave with the shortest resolvable wavelength, $\\lambda_{\\min}$, as determined by the continuum dispersion relation $f = c/\\lambda$:\n$$\nf_{\\text{spatial}} = \\frac{c}{\\lambda_{\\min}} = \\frac{340\\,\\text{m s}^{-1}}{499.84\\,\\text{m}} \\approx 0.6802\\,\\text{Hz}\n$$\nThe temporal Nyquist frequency is determined by the time step $\\Delta t_a$:\n$$\nf_{\\text{temporal}} = \\frac{1}{2\\Delta t_a} = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 0.50\\,\\text{s}} = \\frac{1}{1.0\\,\\text{s}} = 1.0\\,\\text{Hz}\n$$\nThe maximum representable frequency is the minimum of these two values:\n$$\nf_{\\max} = \\min(f_{\\text{spatial}}, f_{\\text{temporal}}) = \\min(0.6802\\,\\text{Hz}, 1.0\\,\\text{Hz}) = 0.6802\\,\\text{Hz}\n$$\n\n**3) Assessment of Infrasound Representation**\n\nThe specified range for typical infrasound signals is $0.01$–$20\\,\\text{Hz}$. The calculated maximum resolvable frequency for the given model configuration is $f_{\\max} \\approx 0.680\\,\\text{Hz}$.\n\nThis indicates that the model configuration can only represent the lower portion of the infrasound spectrum, specifically frequencies from $0.01\\,\\text{Hz}$ up to approximately $0.680\\,\\text{Hz}$. It is incapable of representing any infrasound signals with frequencies higher than this limit, which includes the majority of the specified $0.01$–$20\\,\\text{Hz}$ range. The spatial resolution, particularly in the vertical direction ($\\Delta z$), is the limiting factor for the model's ability to resolve high-frequency acoustic waves.\n\nThe final required answer is $f_{\\max}$ rounded to three significant figures.\n$f_{\\max} \\approx 0.680\\,\\text{Hz}$.",
