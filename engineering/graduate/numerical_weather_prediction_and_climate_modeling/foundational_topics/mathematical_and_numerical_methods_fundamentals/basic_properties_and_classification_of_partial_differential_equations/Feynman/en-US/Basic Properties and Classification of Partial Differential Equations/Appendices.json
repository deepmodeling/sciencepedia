Explain why the flux Jacobian coincides with the characteristic speed of the PDE.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically and mathematically sound. The equation $\\partial_{t} u + u \\, \\partial_{x} u = 0$ is the inviscid Burgers' equation, a canonical example of a nonlinear hyperbolic PDE used extensively in fluid dynamics and the study of conservation laws. The concepts of conservation laws, flux functions, flux Jacobians, and characteristic speeds are fundamental and well-defined in the theory of partial differential equations. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary information provided. The language is precise and objective. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors. The task is a standard exercise in the analysis of hyperbolic conservation laws and is directly relevant to the stated field of numerical weather prediction, where advective processes are central.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be furnished.\n\nThe problem asks us to analyze the scalar partial differential equation $\\partial_{t} u + u \\, \\partial_{x} u = 0$. This is a specific instance of a more general class of equations known as scalar conservation laws.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Conservative Form and Flux Function**\n\nA general one-dimensional scalar conservation law is written in the form:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} u + \\partial_{x} f(u) = 0\n$$\nHere, $u = u(x,t)$ is the conserved quantity, and $f(u)$ is the flux function, which describes the rate of flow of $u$. The problem requires us to cast the given PDE into this standard conservative form. To do this, we apply the chain rule to the spatial derivative of the flux function, $\\partial_{x} f(u)$:\n$$\n\\partial_{x} f(u) = \\frac{df(u)}{du} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = f'(u) \\, \\partial_{x} u\n$$\nSubstituting this result into the general conservation law form, we obtain the \"quasilinear\" form of the equation:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} u + f'(u) \\, \\partial_{x} u = 0\n$$\nWe now compare this general quasilinear form to the specific PDE given in the problem:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} u + u \\, \\partial_{x} u = 0\n$$\nBy direct comparison of the term multiplying the spatial derivative $\\partial_{x} u$, we can identify the relationship between the flux function and the field $u$:\n$$\nf'(u) = \\frac{df}{du} = u\n$$\nTo find the flux function $f(u)$ itself, we integrate this expression with respect to $u$:\n$$\nf(u) = \\int u \\, du = \\frac{1}{2} u^2 + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is an arbitrary constant of integration. In the context of the PDE $\\partial_{t} u + \\partial_{x} f(u) = 0$, the constant $C$ is immaterial because its spatial derivative is zero: $\\partial_{x} C = 0$. Therefore, we can choose the simplest form by setting $C=0$. The resulting flux function is:\n$$\nf(u) = \\frac{1}{2} u^2\n$$\nWith this flux function, the original PDE, $\\partial_{t} u + u \\, \\partial_{x} u = 0$, can be rewritten in its conservative form as:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} u + \\partial_{x} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} u^2 \\right) = 0\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Computation of the Flux Jacobian**\n\nThe flux Jacobian is the derivative of the flux function with respect to the conserved variable. For a scalar equation, this is simply the ordinary derivative $\\frac{df}{du}$, also denoted $\\partial_u f(u)$. As established in the previous step:\n$$\n\\partial_{u} f(u) = \\frac{d}{du} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} u^2 \\right) = u\n$$\nSo, the flux Jacobian for the inviscid Burgers' equation is the field variable $u$ itself.\n\n**Part 3: Equivalence of Flux Jacobian and Characteristic Speed**\n\nThe characteristic speed of a first-order hyperbolic PDE is the speed at which information (i.e., a specific value of the solution $u$) propagates. We can find this speed using the method of characteristics. Consider a curve $x(t)$ in the $(x,t)$-plane. The total derivative of the solution $u(x(t), t)$ along this curve is given by the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\frac{dx}{dt}\n$$\nFrom the given PDE, we can express the time derivative $\\partial_{t} u$ as:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} u = -u \\, \\partial_{x} u\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the total derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dt} = (-u \\, \\partial_{x} u) + \\frac{dx}{dt} (\\partial_{x} u) = \\left( \\frac{dx}{dt} - u \\right) \\partial_{x} u\n$$\nThe characteristic curves are defined as the specific paths in the $(x,t)$-plane along which the PDE simplifies into an ordinary differential equation (ODE). This is achieved by choosing the path $x(t)$ such that the term multiplying $\\partial_{x} u$ vanishes. By setting this term to zero, we find the ODE that defines the characteristic path:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} - u = 0 \\implies \\frac{dx}{dt} = u\n$$\nAlong these characteristic curves, the total derivative $\\frac{du}{dt}$ becomes zero:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dt} = 0\n$$\nThe first equation, $\\frac{dx}{dt} = u$, defines the characteristic speed, conventionally denoted by $c$. Thus, the characteristic speed is $c = u$. This means that a given value of $u$ propagates through the domain at a speed equal to itself. This is the source of the advective nonlinearity, where larger values of $u$ travel faster than smaller values, leading to wave steepening and shock formation.\n\nBy comparing the results from Part 2 and Part 3, we see that the flux Jacobian, $\\partial_{u} f(u) = u$, is identical to the characteristic speed, $c = u$.\n\nThis is a general property for any scalar conservation law of the form $\\partial_{t} u + \\partial_{x} f(u) = 0$. Its quasilinear form is $\\partial_{t} u + f'(u) \\partial_{x} u = 0$. The characteristic speed is immediately identified as $c = \\frac{dx}{dt} = f'(u)$, which is, by definition, the flux Jacobian $\\partial_{u} f(u)$.",

It is a scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective question about the fundamental theory of scalar conservation laws. I will now proceed with the derivation and evaluation of the options.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe partial differential equation (PDE) is given by\n$$\n\\partial_t u + \\partial_x f(u) = 0.\n$$\nThis equation expresses the conservation of the quantity $u$ within any given spatial interval.\n\n**1. Weak Formulation**\n\nTo derive the weak formulation, we assume $u(x,t)$ is a classical ($C^1$) solution for now. We multiply the PDE by an arbitrary smooth test function $\\varphi \\in C_c^\\infty(\\mathbb{R} \\times [0,\\infty))$, which is infinitely differentiable and has compact support. Integrating over the space-time domain $\\mathbb{R} \\times (0,\\infty)$ gives:\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} (\\partial_t u + \\partial_x f(u)) \\varphi \\,dx\\,dt = 0.\n$$\nWe use integration by parts (Green's theorem) to move the derivatives from $u$ and $f(u)$ to the test function $\\varphi$.\nThe time derivative term becomes:\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} (\\partial_t u)\\varphi \\,dx\\,dt = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} [u\\varphi]_0^\\infty \\,dx - \\int_0^\\infty \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} u (\\partial_t\\varphi) \\,dx\\,dt.\n$$\nSince $\\varphi$ has compact support in $t \\in [0,\\infty)$, $\\varphi(x,t)=0$ for sufficiently large $t$. The upper boundary term $[u\\varphi]_\\infty$ vanishes. The lower boundary term at $t=0$ is $-u(x,0)\\varphi(x,0) = -u_0(x)\\varphi(x,0)$. Thus,\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} (\\partial_t u)\\varphi \\,dx\\,dt = - \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} u_0(x)\\varphi(x,0)\\,dx - \\int_0^\\infty \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} u (\\partial_t\\varphi) \\,dx\\,dt.\n$$\nThe space derivative term becomes:\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} (\\partial_x f(u))\\varphi \\,dx\\,dt = \\int_0^\\infty [f(u)\\varphi]_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\,dt - \\int_0^\\infty \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(u) (\\partial_x\\varphi) \\,dx\\,dt.\n$$\nSince $\\varphi$ has compact support in $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the boundary terms $[f(u)\\varphi]_{-\\infty}^\\infty$ vanish. The term becomes:\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} (\\partial_x f(u))\\varphi \\,dx\\,dt = - \\int_0^\\infty \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(u) (\\partial_x\\varphi) \\,dx\\,dt.\n$$\nSubstituting these back into the integrated equation gives:\n$$\n\\left( - \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} u_0(x)\\varphi(x,0)\\,dx - \\int_0^\\infty \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} u (\\partial_t\\varphi) \\,dx\\,dt \\right) + \\left( - \\int_0^\\infty \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(u) (\\partial_x\\varphi) \\,dx\\,dt \\right) = 0.\n$$\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\big(u\\,\\partial_t \\varphi + f(u)\\,\\partial_x \\varphi\\big)\\,dx\\,dt + \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} u_0(x)\\,\\varphi(x,0)\\,dx = 0.\n$$\nThis integral equation is taken as the definition of a weak solution. It is valid even if $u$ is not differentiable (e.g., if $u \\in L^\\infty$), as derivatives only act on the smooth function $\\varphi$.\n\n**2. Non-uniqueness and Entropy Conditions**\n\nWeak solutions defined this way are not unique. A classic example is the Riemann problem for Burgers' equation ($f(u) = u^2/2$) with initial data $u_0(x) = 1$ for $x0$ and $u_0(x) = 0$ for $x>0$. Both a shock wave and a rarefaction wave can be constructed as weak solutions, but only the shock is physically correct.\n\nPhysical solutions are those that arise as limits of viscous solutions ($\\partial_t u + \\partial_x f(u) = \\epsilon \\partial_{xx} u$ as $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$). This \"vanishing viscosity\" limit imposes an additional constraint, known as an entropy condition. For any convex function $\\eta(u)$ (an entropy), with corresponding entropy flux $q(u)$ defined by $q'(u) = \\eta'(u) f'(u)$, the physical solution must satisfy the entropy inequality:\n$$\n\\partial_t \\eta(u) + \\partial_x q(u) \\le 0\n$$\nin the sense of distributions. This reflects the principle that entropy can only be produced (or conserved), not destroyed, consistent with the second law of thermodynamics. This condition selects a unique, physically relevant weak solution.\n\n---\n\n**Option A. A function $u\\in L^\\infty(\\mathbb{R}\\times (0,\\infty))$ is a weak solution with initial data $u_0\\in L^\\infty(\\mathbb{R})$ if, for every test function $\\varphi\\in C_c^\\infty(\\mathbb{R}\\times [0,\\infty))$, the integral identity\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\big(u\\,\\partial_t \\varphi + f(u)\\,\\partial_x \\varphi\\big)\\,dx\\,dt + \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} u_0(x)\\,\\varphi(x,0)\\,dx = 0\n$$\nholds. This formulation follows from integrating the conservation law over space-time and shifting derivatives onto $\\varphi$ so that discontinuities in $u$ are admissible.**\n\nOur derivation above yields this exact integral identity. The reasoning provided in the option is also correct: it correctly identifies the function spaces for the solution $u$ and initial data $u_0$, the space for test functions $\\varphi$, and the procedure of shifting derivatives via integration by parts.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n---\n\n**Option B. A weak solution is any function $u\\in C^1(\\mathbb{R}\\times (0,\\infty))$ that satisfies $\\partial_t u + \\partial_x f(u)=0$ pointwise almost everywhere, and for such weak solutions, uniqueness follows from the conservation law without any additional conditions.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect for two primary reasons. First, the definition of a weak solution is specifically to relax the $C^1$ smoothness requirement. A weak solution is generally in $L^\\infty$ and is not required to be differentiable. A $C^1$ solution is a *classical* solution. Second, the claim that uniqueness follows without additional conditions is false. The non-uniqueness of weak solutions is the central motivation for introducing entropy conditions.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n---\n\n**Option C. To select physically relevant solutions when discontinuities occur, one requires an entropy condition: for every convex entropy $\\eta\\in C^2(\\mathbb{R})$ with associated entropy flux $q$ determined by $q'(u)=\\eta'(u)\\,f'(u)$, the inequality\n$$\n\\partial_t \\eta(u) + \\partial_x q(u) \\le 0\n$$\nholds in the sense of distributions on $\\mathbb{R}\\times (0,\\infty)$. This requirement enforces irreversibility consistent with vanishing viscosity limits and yields uniqueness and $L^1$-contraction within the class of entropy solutions.**\n\nThis statement is a precise and accurate summary of the theory of entropy solutions for scalar conservation laws. It correctly identifies the convexity requirement for the entropy $\\eta$, the relationship between the entropy flux $q$, entropy $\\eta$, and physical flux $f$, and the form of the entropy inequality $\\le 0$. Furthermore, it correctly states the profound consequences of this condition: it enforces physical irreversibility and guarantees existence, uniqueness, and stability ($L^1$-contraction) of solutions.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n---\n\n**Option D. Because any discontinuity in a weak solution must satisfy the Rankine–Hugoniot jump condition, this jump condition alone is sufficient to ensure that the weak solution with given initial data is unique and physically relevant, so no additional admissibility criteria are needed.**\n\nThe Rankine–Hugoniot condition is a necessary condition that any discontinuity in a weak solution must obey. It is derived directly from the weak formulation. However, it is not a sufficient condition for physical admissibility or uniqueness. As mentioned previously, non-physical weak solutions (e.g., expansion shocks) can satisfy the Rankine–Hugoniot condition. Therefore, additional criteria—namely, the entropy condition—are essential.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n---\n\n**Option E. In the Kružkov framework, admissibility is enforced by requiring that, for every $k\\in \\mathbb{R}$, the inequality\n$$\n\\partial_t |u-k| + \\partial_x\\big(\\operatorname{sgn}(u-k)\\,(f(u)-f(k))\\big) \\ge 0\n$$\nholds in the sense of distributions. This inequality is equivalent to the convex entropy formulation and selects the unique physically relevant solution.**\n\nThe Kružkov formulation uses the family of convex entropies $\\eta_k(u) = |u-k|$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The corresponding entropy flux is indeed $q_k(u) = \\operatorname{sgn}(u-k)(f(u)-f(k))$. The statement that this framework is equivalent to the general convex entropy formulation and ensures uniqueness is also correct. However, the inequality sign is wrong. The vanishing viscosity argument leads to the entropy inequality $\\partial_t \\eta(u) + \\partial_x q(u) \\le 0$. The statement provides $\\ge 0$, which would select for anti-dissipative, non-physical phenomena. This is a critical error.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",

The reflection coefficient is the ratio of their complex amplitudes, $R = A/B$.\n\nTo find $R$, we impose the boundary condition. It is convenient to work with the complex-valued solution $u_c(x,t) = U(x) \\exp(- \\mathrm{i} \\omega t)$, since the operator is linear.\nWe require the time and space derivatives of $u_c$:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} u_c(x,t) = - \\mathrm{i} \\omega \\, U(x) \\exp(- \\mathrm{i} \\omega t)\n$$\n$$\n\\partial_{x} u_c(x,t) = U'(x) \\exp(- \\mathrm{i} \\omega t) = \\left( - \\mathrm{i} k B \\exp(- \\mathrm{i} k x) + \\mathrm{i} k A \\exp(\\mathrm{i} k x) \\right) \\exp(- \\mathrm{i} \\omega t)\n$$\nApplying the boundary condition $(\\partial_t - c_b \\partial_x)u_c=0$ at $x=0$:\n$$\n- \\mathrm{i} \\omega \\, U(0) \\exp(- \\mathrm{i} \\omega t) - c_b \\, U'(0) \\exp(- \\mathrm{i} \\omega t) = 0\n$$\nThe term $\\exp(- \\mathrm{i} \\omega t)$ cancels, leaving an equation for the spatial amplitudes at $x=0$:\n$$\n- \\mathrm{i} \\omega \\, U(0) - c_b \\, U'(0) = 0\n$$\nWe evaluate $U(x)$ and $U'(x)$ at $x=0$:\n$$\nU(0) = B \\exp(0) + A \\exp(0) = A + B\n$$\n$$\nU'(0) = - \\mathrm{i} k B \\exp(0) + \\mathrm{i} k A \\exp(0) = \\mathrm{i} k (A - B)\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the boundary condition equation:\n$$\n- \\mathrm{i} \\omega (A + B) - c_b \\left[ \\mathrm{i} k (A - B) \\right] = 0\n$$\nWe can divide through by the common factor $-\\mathrm{i}$ (since $\\omega  0$, $\\mathrm{i} \\ne 0$):\n$$\n\\omega (A + B) + c_b k (A - B) = 0\n$$\nNow, substitute the dispersion relation $k = \\omega/c$:\n$$\n\\omega (A + B) + c_b \\frac{\\omega}{c} (A - B) = 0\n$$\nSince $\\omega  0$, we can divide by $\\omega$:\n$$\n(A + B) + \\frac{c_b}{c} (A - B) = 0\n$$\nOur goal is to solve for the reflection coefficient $R = A/B$. We rearrange the equation to group terms with $A$ and $B$:\n$$\nA \\left( 1 + \\frac{c_b}{c} \\right) + B \\left( 1 - \\frac{c_b}{c} \\right) = 0\n$$\n$$\nA \\left( 1 + \\frac{c_b}{c} \\right) = -B \\left( 1 - \\frac{c_b}{c} \\right) = B \\left( \\frac{c_b}{c} - 1 \\right)\n$$\nDividing by $B$ (assuming $B \\ne 0$, i.e., there is an incident wave) and by the term multiplying $A$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{A}{B} = \\frac{\\frac{c_b}{c} - 1}{1 + \\frac{c_b}{c}}\n$$\nTo simplify this expression, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $c$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{c_b - c}{c_b + c}\n$$\nThis is the analytical expression for the complex-valued reflection coefficient $R$ in terms of the true medium sound speed $c$ and the boundary condition parameter $c_b$. For the perfect ABC where $c_b = c$, the reflection coefficient is $R = (c-c)/(c+c) = 0$, indicating no reflection, as expected. In the solution, there was a minor logical error in the description of the perfect ABC. A perfect ABC for outgoing (left-traveling) waves at x=0 is $(\\partial_t - c\\partial_x)u = 0$. The text incorrectly states this is for right-traveling waves. This has been corrected. In the provided solution, this was stated as: `The component g(x+ct) satisfies the one-way wave equation $(\\partial_t - c \\partial_x)g = c \\frac{d g}{d(x+ct)} - c \\frac{d g}{d(x+ct)} = 0$. Thus, imposing the condition $(\\partial_t - c \\partial_x)u = 0 \\quad \\text{at} \\quad x=0$ constructs the perfect ABC. It allows any left-traveling wave to pass through the boundary unimpeded.` This has been corrected to clarify that $(\\partial_t-c\\partial_x)u=0$ is the condition for left-traveling waves.",
