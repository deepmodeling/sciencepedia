            "solution": "The problem requires determining the number of independent scalar boundary conditions needed for a well-posed initial-boundary value problem for the one-dimensional compressible Euler equations at a subsonic inflow boundary. The determination must be based on the first principles of hyperbolic systems, specifically characteristic analysis.\n\nThe one-dimensional compressible Euler equations can be written in the quasi-linear form $\\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial t} + A(W)\\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial x} = 0$, where $W$ is a vector of state variables and $A(W)$ is the system Jacobian matrix. For this analysis, it is most convenient to use the primitive variables $W = (\\rho, u, p)^{\\top}$, where $\\rho$ is the density, $u$ is the velocity, and $p$ is the pressure.\n\nThe Euler equations in terms of primitive variables are:\n1.  Continuity: $\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial x} + \\rho \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0$\n2.  Momentum: $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} = 0$\n3.  Energy (in terms of pressure for a calorically perfect gas, assuming smooth flow, which implies constant entropy along streamlines): $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} + \\gamma p \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0$ where $\\gamma$ is the ratio of specific heats.\n\nThis system can be written in matrix form as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\begin{pmatrix} \\rho \\\\ u \\\\ p \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} u & \\rho & 0 \\\\ 0 & u & \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\\\ 0 & \\gamma p & u \\end{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\begin{pmatrix} \\rho \\\\ u \\\\ p \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe Jacobian matrix $A$ for the primitive variable formulation is thus:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} u & \\rho & 0 \\\\ 0 & u & \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\\\ 0 & \\gamma p & u \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe theory of hyperbolic partial differential equations states that for a boundary to be well-posed, the number of boundary conditions that must be specified is equal to the number of characteristic waves entering the computational domain at that boundary. The direction and speed of these waves are given by the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix $A$.\n\nWe find the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} u-\\lambda & \\rho & 0 \\\\ 0 & u-\\lambda & \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\\\ 0 & \\gamma p & u-\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\nExpanding the determinant along the first column, we get:\n$$\n(u-\\lambda) \\left[ (u-\\lambda)^2 - \\left(\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\right)(\\gamma p) \\right] = 0\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{\\gamma p}{\\rho}$ is the square of the speed of sound, $a^2$. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n$$\n(u-\\lambda) \\left[ (u-\\lambda)^2 - a^2 \\right] = 0\n$$\nThis equation yields three distinct real eigenvalues, confirming the hyperbolic nature of the Euler equations:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 = u - a\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_2 = u\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_3 = u + a\n$$\nThese eigenvalues represent the speeds of propagation of information along characteristic curves in the $x-t$ plane. A positive eigenvalue signifies a characteristic wave propagating in the positive $x$-direction (into a domain $x \\in [0,L]$ at the $x=0$ boundary), while a negative eigenvalue signifies propagation in the negative $x$-direction (out of the domain at $x=0$).\n\nThe problem specifies a subsonic inflow condition at the boundary $x=0$. This is defined by:\n1.  Inflow: $u > 0$\n2.  Subsonic: The Mach number $M = u/a$ satisfies $0  M  1$. This implies $u  a$.\n\nWe now evaluate the signs of the three eigenvalues under these conditions:\n1.  $\\lambda_1 = u - a$: Since $u  a$, it follows that $u - a  0$. This characteristic is propagating out of the domain. It carries information from the interior of the domain to the boundary.\n2.  $\\lambda_2 = u$: Since $u > 0$, it follows that $\\lambda_2 > 0$. This characteristic is propagating into the domain. It carries information from outside the domain to the boundary. Physically, this characteristic is associated with the transport of entropy.\n3.  $\\lambda_3 = u + a$: Since $u > 0$ and $a > 0$, it follows that $u + a > 0$. This characteristic is also propagating into the domain. It carries information from outside, typically represented by the forward-running Riemann invariant $J^+ = u + \\frac{2a}{\\gamma-1}$.\n\nThere are two positive eigenvalues ($\\lambda_2$ and $\\lambda_3$) and one negative eigenvalue ($\\lambda_1$). The number of boundary conditions to be prescribed at $x=0$ must equal the number of characteristics entering the domain, which is the number of positive eigenvalues.\n\nTherefore, for a well-posed problem at a subsonic inflow boundary, exactly two independent scalar boundary conditions must be supplied. The third piece of information required to fully determine the state ($\\rho, u, p$) at the boundary is provided by the outgoing characteristic ($\\lambda_1 = u - a$), which transports information from the interior solution to the boundary.\n\nA minimal, physically meaningful set of boundary conditions would be any two independent quantities that fix the state of the incoming flow, in conjunction with the relation provided by the outgoing characteristic. For instance, one could specify two thermodynamic invariants, such as stagnation pressure ($p_0$) and stagnation temperature ($T_0$). Alternatively, one could specify two primitive variables (e.g., pressure $p$ and density $\\rho$, or velocity $u$ and pressure $p$). The key result of the characteristic analysis is that the number of such conditions must be two.",
