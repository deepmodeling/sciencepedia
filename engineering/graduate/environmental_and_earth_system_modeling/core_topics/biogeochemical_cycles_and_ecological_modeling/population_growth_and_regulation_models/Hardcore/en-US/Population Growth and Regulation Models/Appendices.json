            "solution": "The problem statement is first validated for scientific and mathematical soundness.\n\n**1. Problem Validation**\n\nThe problem describes a single-species population model where the per-capita growth rate decreases linearly with population size.\nLet $N(t)$ be the population size at time $t$. The per-capita growth rate is $\\frac{1}{N}\\frac{dN}{dt}$.\nThe statement that this rate decreases linearly with abundance $N$ can be written as:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{N}\\frac{dN}{dt} = A - BN\n$$\nfor some positive constants $A$ and $B$.\n\nThe problem defines $r$ as the intrinsic growth rate, which is the per-capita growth rate in the limit of zero population size. Thus, as $N \\to 0$, we have $\\frac{1}{N}\\frac{dN}{dt} \\to r$. From our linear form, this implies $A = r$.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{N}\\frac{dN}{dt} = r - BN\n$$\n\nThe problem also defines $K$ as the carrying capacity, which is the non-zero population size at which the population growth ceases. Setting the growth rate to zero, we have:\n$$\n0 = r - BK \\implies B = \\frac{r}{K}\n$$\nSubstituting $B$ back into the per-capita growth rate equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{N}\\frac{dN}{dt} = r - \\frac{r}{K}N = r\\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right)\n$$\nMultiplying by $N$ gives the governing Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) for the population dynamics:\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = rN\\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the well-known logistic equation. The problem is scientifically grounded, as it describes a fundamental model in population ecology. It is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Nondimensional ODE**\n\nWe are tasked with deriving the nondimensional form of the logistic equation using the given scaling transformations.\nThe dimensional variables are the population size $N$ and time $t$.\nThe dimensional parameters are the intrinsic growth rate $r$ (units of $1/\\text{time}$) and the carrying capacity $K$ (units of population).\nThe governing dimensional equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = rN\\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right)\n$$\nThe nondimensional variables are defined as:\n$$\nu = \\frac{N}{K} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\tau = r t\n$$\nFrom these definitions, we can express the original dimensional variables in terms of the new nondimensional ones:\n$$\nN = K u \\quad \\text{and} \\quad t = \\frac{\\tau}{r}\n$$\nOur goal is to find the ODE for $u(\\tau)$, which is $\\frac{du}{d\\tau}$. We use the chain rule to transform the derivative with respect to $t$ into a derivative with respect to $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = \\frac{d(Ku)}{dt} = K \\frac{du}{dt}\n$$\nNow, we relate $\\frac{du}{dt}$ to $\\frac{du}{d\\tau}$:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dt} = \\frac{du}{d\\tau} \\frac{d\\tau}{dt}\n$$\nSince $\\tau = rt$, we have $\\frac{d\\tau}{dt} = r$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\frac{du}{dt}$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dt} = r \\frac{du}{d\\tau}\n$$\nTherefore, the left-hand side of the original ODE becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = K r \\frac{du}{d\\tau}\n$$\nNow we substitute this and $N = Ku$ into the full logistic equation:\n$$\nK r \\frac{du}{d\\tau} = r(Ku)\\left(1 - \\frac{Ku}{K}\\right)\n$$\nWe can simplify the term in the parenthesis:\n$$\nK r \\frac{du}{d\\tau} = rKu(1 - u)\n$$\nAssuming $r \\neq 0$ and $K \\neq 0$, which are physical requirements for a meaningful model, we can divide both sides by the factor $Kr$:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{d\\tau} = u(1-u)\n$$\nThis is the nondimensional form of the logistic equation. It is expressed in the form $\\frac{du}{d\\tau} = f(u)$, where the nondimensional right-hand side is:\n$$\nf(u) = u(1 - u)\n$$\n\n**3. Explanation of Parameter Space Reduction**\n\nThe original dimensional model, $\\frac{dN}{dt} = rN(1 - \\frac{N}{K})$, has its dynamics determined by the two parameters $r$ and $K$. The set of all possible behaviors of this system is described by a two-dimensional parameter space, with coordinates $(r, K)$. Any complete analysis would, in principle, need to explore this entire space.\n\nThe nondimensionalization process transforms the system into $\\frac{du}{d\\tau} = u(1 - u)$. This resulting equation is completely free of parameters. The parameters $r$ and $K$ have not vanished; rather, they have been absorbed into the definitions of the nondimensional variables $u = N/K$ and $\\tau = rt$. The variable $N$ is scaled by its characteristic value $K$, and time $t$ is scaled by the characteristic timescale $1/r$.\n\nThis transformation reveals a profound property of the system: all logistic growth models, regardless of their specific $r$ and $K$ values, are mathematically equivalent. They are all described by the same universal, parameter-free dynamic equation. The apparent two-dimensional parameter space $(r, K)$ has been collapsed to a zero-dimensional space for the governing equation itself.\n\nThe only remaining factor that distinguishes one specific scenario from another is the initial condition. A dimensional initial condition $N(t=0) = N_0$ is transformed into a nondimensional initial condition $u(\\tau=0) = \\frac{N_0}{K} = u_0$. Thus, the entire family of solutions to the original ODE, which depends on $(r, K, N_0)$, is mapped onto a simpler family of solutions to the nondimensional ODE, which depends only on the single nondimensional parameter $u_0$.\n\nThis reduction is a central benefit of nondimensionalization. It simplifies the analysis by reducing the number of free parameters, revealing the fundamental structure of the problem, and allowing a single computed solution for $u(\\tau)$ to describe the behavior of an infinite number of dimensional systems. To find a specific dimensional solution $N(t)$, one simply solves the universal equation for $u(\\tau)$ with the appropriate $u_0$, and then transforms back using $N(t) = K u(rt)$.",

The trivial fixed point:\n    $$\n    x_1^{\\ast} = 0\n    $$\n    This fixed point, representing population extinction, exists for all values of $r$.\n\n2.  The nontrivial fixed point, obtained by setting the term in brackets to zero:\n    $$\n    r(1 - x_2^{\\ast}) - 1 = 0\n    $$\n    $$\n    r - r x_2^{\\ast} - 1 = 0\n    $$\n    $$\n    r x_2^{\\ast} = r - 1\n    $$\n    $$\n    x_2^{\\ast} = \\frac{r-1}{r} = 1 - \\frac{1}{r}\n    $$\n    This fixed point is biologically meaningful (i.e., $x_2^{\\ast}  0$) only when $1 - \\frac{1}{r}  0$, which implies $r  1$.\n\nNext, we analyze the local stability of these fixed points. Stability is determined by the magnitude of the derivative of the map, $f_r'(x)$, evaluated at the fixed point. A fixed point $x^{\\ast}$ is locally asymptotically stable if $|f_r'(x^{\\ast})|  1$.\n\nFirst, we compute the derivative of $f_r(x) = rx - rx^2$:\n$$\nf_r'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} (rx - rx^2) = r - 2rx\n$$\n\nNow, we evaluate this derivative at the nontrivial fixed point, $x_2^{\\ast} = 1 - \\frac{1}{r}$, for the domain where it exists, $r  1$.\n$$\nf_r'(x_2^{\\ast}) = r - 2r \\left( \\frac{r-1}{r} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nf_r'(x_2^{\\ast}) = r - 2(r-1)\n$$\n$$\nf_r'(x_2^{\\ast}) = r - 2r + 2\n$$\n$$\nf_r'(x_2^{\\ast}) = 2 - r\n$$\nThe stability condition for the nontrivial fixed point is $|f_r'(x_2^{\\ast})|  1$, which translates to:\n$$\n|2 - r|  1\n$$\nThis inequality is equivalent to the compound inequality:\n$$\n-1  2 - r  1\n$$\nWe solve this for $r$.\nFirst, consider the left side:\n$$\n-1  2 - r \\implies r  2 + 1 \\implies r  3\n$$\nNext, consider the right side:\n$$\n2 - r  1 \\implies 1  r\n$$\nCombining these results with the existence condition ($r  1$), we find that the nontrivial fixed point $x_2^{\\ast}$ is locally asymptotically stable for $1  r  3$.\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $r$ where this fixed point first loses stability via a flip (or period-doubling) bifurcation. Such a bifurcation occurs when the derivative of the map at the fixed point passes through $-1$. Loss of stability occurs when $|f_r'(x_2^{\\ast})| \\ge 1$. The boundary of the stability region is defined by $|f_r'(x_2^{\\ast})|=1$.\n\nSetting the derivative equal to $-1$:\n$$\nf_r'(x_2^{\\ast}) = 2 - r = -1\n$$\nSolving for $r$ gives:\n$$\nr = 2 + 1 = 3\n$$\nAt $r=3$, the derivative at the nontrivial fixed point is exactly $-1$. For $r  3$, the derivative becomes less than $-1$ (e.g., at $r=3.1$, the derivative is $2 - 3.1 = -1.1$), and thus its magnitude, $|2-r|$, becomes greater than $1$. This causes the fixed point to become unstable and gives rise to a stable period-2 cycle. This is the definition of a flip or period-doubling bifurcation.\n\nTherefore, the precise value of $r$ at which the nontrivial fixed point first loses stability through a flip bifurcation is $3$.",

There are no other transitions or direct survival looping within an age class. The model is linear under these assumptions.\n\nFundamental base and modeling assumptions:\n- Discrete population accounting: the next time step $x_{t+1}$ is obtained by summing births contributed to age class $1$ from all age classes through $F_i x_{t,i}$, and survivals from age class $1$ to age class $2$ via $S_1 x_{t,1}$, and from age class $2$ to age class $3$ via $S_2 x_{t,2}$.\n- The process is time-invariant, so a single fixed linear operator (a matrix) maps $x_t$ to $x_{t+1}$.\n- This matrix is nonnegative, and for broadly realistic parameter sets it has a unique dominant real eigenvalue by the Perron–Frobenius theorem, which determines the long-run multiplicative growth factor per time step.

            "solution": "The problem requires the analysis of a discrete-time, age-structured population model with three age classes. The dynamics of the population are described by a linear system, which can be represented by a matrix equation.\n\nFirst, we must construct the transition matrix, known as the Leslie matrix, based on the provided population accounting rules. Let the population vector at time step $t$ be $x_t = (x_{t,1}, x_{t,2}, x_{t,3})^\\top$, where $x_{t,i}$ is the number of individuals in age class $i$. The population vector at the next time step, $x_{t+1}$, is given by $x_{t+1} = L x_t$, where $L$ is the $3 \\times 3$ Leslie matrix.\n\nThe components of $x_{t+1}$ are determined as follows:\n1.  The first age class at time $t+1$, $x_{t+1,1}$, consists of all newborn individuals. These are produced by individuals in all three age classes at time $t$ according to their per-capita fecundities $F_1, F_2, F_3$. Thus, the total number of newborns is $x_{t+1,1} = F_1 x_{t,1} + F_2 x_{t,2} + F_3 x_{t,3}$. This equation defines the first row of the matrix $L$ as $(F_1, F_2, F_3)$.\n2.  The second age class at time $t+1$, $x_{t+1,2}$, consists of individuals who survived from the first age class at time $t$. This is determined by the survival probability $S_1$. Thus, $x_{t+1,2} = S_1 x_{t,1}$. This defines the second row of $L$ as $(S_1, 0, 0)$.\n3.  The third age class at time $t+1$, $x_{t+1,3}$, consists of individuals who survived from the second age class at time $t$. This is determined by the survival probability $S_2$. Thus, $x_{t+1,3} = S_2 x_{t,2}$. This defines the third row of $L$ as $(0, S_2, 0)$.\n\nCombining these, the Leslie matrix $L$ is:\n$$\nL = \\begin{pmatrix}\nF_1  F_2  F_3 \\\\\nS_1  0  0 \\\\\n0  S_2  0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe long-term dynamics of the population are determined by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix $L$. The Perron–Frobenius theorem for non-negative matrices states that there exists a non-negative real eigenvalue, known as the dominant eigenvalue $\\lambda$, which is greater than or equal to the magnitude of any other eigenvalue. This eigenvalue $\\lambda$ represents the asymptotic growth factor of the population per time step. The right eigenvector $v$ corresponding to $\\lambda$ has non-negative components and represents the stable age distribution. When normalized such that its components sum to $1$, the eigenvector gives the long-term proportion of the population in each age class.\n\nThe computational procedure for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Construct the $3 \\times 3$ matrix $L$ using the specific numerical values for fecundities $F=(F_1, F_2, F_3)$ and survival probabilities $S=(S_1, S_2)$ provided.\n2.  Use a numerical algorithm to compute all eigenvalues and their corresponding right eigenvectors of the matrix $L$.\n3.

Round the dominant eigenvalue $\\lambda$ and each component of the normalized eigenvector $v_{norm}$ to six decimal places.\n7.  Collect these four values, $[\\lambda, v_{norm_1}, v_{norm_2}, v_{norm_3}]$, for each case.\n\nThis procedure is applied to each of the five parameter sets defined in the problem statement.
