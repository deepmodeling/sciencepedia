A solution will now be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis proceeds by first establishing the algebraic relationships between the fluxes and CUE, and then propagating the uncertainty as specified.\n\n**1. Calculation of the Microbial Growth Flux ($G$)**\nThe Carbon Use Efficiency (CUE) is defined as the ratio of the growth flux ($G$) to the total substrate uptake flux ($U$):\n$$\n\\mathrm{CUE} = \\frac{G}{U}\n$$\nBy rearranging this equation, we can solve for the growth flux $G$:\n$$\nG = \\mathrm{CUE} \\times U\n$$\nSubstituting the given values for CUE and $U$:\n$$\nG = 0.45 \\times 100\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,C\\,m^{-2}\\,d^{-1}} = 45\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,C\\,m^{-2}\\,d^{-1}}\n$$\n\n**2. Calculation of the Microbial Respiration Flux ($R$)**\nThe principle of mass conservation states that the total carbon uptake is partitioned between growth and respiration:\n$$\nU = G + R\n$$\nWe can express the respiration flux $R$ in terms of $U$ and $G$:\n$$\nR = U - G\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $G$ from the CUE definition ($G = \\mathrm{CUE} \\times U$) into the equation for $R$:\n$$\nR = U - (\\mathrm{CUE} \\times U) = U(1 - \\mathrm{CUE})\n$$\nUsing the given values for $U$ and CUE:\n$$\nR = 100\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,C\\,m^{-2}\\,d^{-1}} \\times (1 - 0.45) = 100\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,C\\,m^{-2}\\,d^{-1}} \\times 0.55 = 55\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,C\\,m^{-2}\\,d^{-1}}\n$$\n\n**3. Calculation of the Uncertainty in Respiration Flux ($\\sigma_R$)**\nThe problem requires the use of first-order Taylor linearization to propagate the uncertainty from CUE to $R$. The general formula for the propagation of uncertainty for a function $f$ of a single variable $x$ with uncertainty $\\sigma_x$ is:\n$$\n\\sigma_f \\approx \\left| \\frac{df}{dx} \\right| \\sigma_x\n$$\nIn our case, the function is $R(\\mathrm{CUE}) = U(1 - \\mathrm{CUE})$, the variable is CUE, and its uncertainty is $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{CUE}}$. We treat $U$ as a constant with no uncertainty as per the problem statement. The uncertainty in $R$, denoted $\\sigma_R$, is therefore:\n$$\n\\sigma_R = \\left| \\frac{dR}{d\\mathrm{CUE}} \\right| \\sigma_{\\mathrm{CUE}}\n$$\nFirst, we must compute the partial derivative of $R$ with respect to CUE:\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{d\\mathrm{CUE}} = \\frac{d}{d\\mathrm{CUE}} \\left[ U(1 - \\mathrm{CUE}) \\right] = U \\frac{d}{d\\mathrm{CUE}} (1 - \\mathrm{CUE}) = U(0 - 1) = -U\n$$\nThe absolute value of this derivative is:\n$$\n\\left| \\frac{dR}{d\\mathrm{CUE}} \\right| = |-U| = U\n$$\nsince the flux $U$ must be non-negative.\nNow, we can calculate the uncertainty $\\sigma_R$:\n$$\n\\sigma_R = U \\times \\sigma_{\\mathrm{CUE}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\sigma_R = 100\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,C\\,m^{-2}\\,d^{-1}} \\times 0.05 = 5\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,C\\,m^{-2}\\,d^{-1}}\n$$\n\n**Final Results and Rounding**\nThe computed values are:\n- $G = 45\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,C\\,m^{-2}\\,d^{-1}}$\n- $R = 55\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,C\\,m^{-2}\\,d^{-1}}$\n- $\\sigma_R = 5\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,C\\,m^{-2}\\,d^{-1}}$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final numeric answers to $3$ significant figures.\n- $G_s = 45.0\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,C\\,m^{-2}\\,d^{-1}}$\n- $R_s = 55.0\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,C\\,m^{-2}\\,d^{-1}}$\n- $\\sigma_{R,s} = 5.00\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,C\\,m^{-2}\\,d^{-1}}$\n\nThe final answer is to be reported as a $3$-entry row vector $\\{G, R, \\sigma_{R}\\}$.",

The microbes assimilate dissolved organic matter characterized by a carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N) ratio, and allocate a fixed fraction of assimilated carbon to growth according to the definition of Carbon Use Efficiency (CUE), which is the fraction of carbon uptake that becomes new biomass rather than being respired as carbon dioxide. Microbial biomass is assumed to maintain a constant C:N ratio. Under these assumptions, the net effect on the mineral nitrogen pool (the pool of inorganic nitrogen available to microbes) results from the balance between the nitrogen accompanying carbon uptake from the substrate and the nitrogen required to support the carbon allocated to microbial growth.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of biogeochemical stoichiometry, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is expressed in objective, unambiguous language.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of an expression for the net effect on the mineral nitrogen pool, $N_{net}$, and the calculation of its value. This net effect is the balance between the nitrogen supplied by the assimilated substrate and the nitrogen demanded for the production of new microbial biomass. We adopt the convention that a positive $N_{net}$ signifies net mineralization (release of mineral N) and a negative $N_{net}$ signifies net immobilization (uptake of mineral N).\n\nLet us define the given parameters symbolically:\n- $R_B$: C:N ratio of microbial biomass, given as $8$.\n- $R_S$: C:N ratio of the substrate, given as $25$.\n- $U_C$: Rate of carbon uptake from the substrate, given as $50\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,C\\,m^{-2}\\,d^{-1}}$.\n- CUE: Carbon Use Efficiency, given as $0.5$.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from first principles of mass balance.\n\nFirst, we determine the rate of nitrogen uptake from the substrate, $U_N$. This is stoichiometrically coupled to the carbon uptake rate, $U_C$, by the substrate's C:N ratio, $R_S$. The amount of nitrogen is the amount of carbon divided by the C:N ratio.\n$$U_N = \\frac{U_C}{R_S}$$\nThis represents the total nitrogen made available to the microbial community from the decomposition of the organic substrate.\n\nNext, we determine the rate of nitrogen required for the growth of new microbial biomass, which we denote as $N_{demand}$. The Carbon Use Efficiency, CUE, is defined as the fraction of assimilated carbon ($U_C$) that is allocated to biosynthesis (growth). Therefore, the rate of carbon incorporated into new biomass is:\n$$C_{growth} = U_C \\times \\text{CUE}$$\nThis new biomass is synthesized with the characteristic microbial C:N ratio, $R_B$. The nitrogen required to support this carbon allocation into new biomass is thus:\n$$N_{demand} = \\frac{C_{growth}}{R_B} = \\frac{U_C \\times \\text{CUE}}{R_B}$$\n\nThe net effect on the mineral nitrogen pool, $N_{net}$, is the difference between the nitrogen supplied from the substrate, $U_N$, and the nitrogen demanded for growth, $N_{demand}$. If the substrate supplies more nitrogen than is needed for growth ($U_N > N_{demand}$), the excess is released into the mineral pool (net mineralization). If the substrate supplies less nitrogen than required ($U_N  N_{demand}$), the deficit must be taken from the mineral pool (net immobilization).\n\nTherefore, the expression for the net effect on the mineral nitrogen pool is:\n$$N_{net} = U_N - N_{demand}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $U_N$ and $N_{demand}$, we get:\n$$N_{net} = \\frac{U_C}{R_S} - \\frac{U_C \\times \\text{CUE}}{R_B}$$\nThis can be factored to yield the general expression:\n$$N_{net} = U_C \\left( \\frac{1}{R_S} - \\frac{\\text{CUE}}{R_B} \\right)$$\nThis equation is the derived expression from first principles. A positive result indicates net mineralization, and a negative result indicates net immobilization, consistent with the problem's sign convention.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression to compute the result.\n- $U_C = 50$\n- $R_S = 25$\n- $\\text{CUE} = 0.5$\n- $R_B = 8$\n\n$$N_{net} = 50 \\left( \\frac{1}{25} - \\frac{0.5}{8} \\right)$$\nFirst, we evaluate the terms inside the parentheses:\n$$\\frac{1}{25} = 0.04$$\n$$\\frac{0.5}{8} = \\frac{1/2}{8} = \\frac{1}{16} = 0.0625$$\nSubstituting these values back into the equation for $N_{net}$:\n$$N_{net} = 50 (0.04 - 0.0625)$$\n$$N_{net} = 50 (-0.0225)$$\n$$N_{net} = -1.125$$\nThe units of this result are $\\mathrm{mg\\,N\\,m^{-2}\\,d^{-1}}$, as required. The negative sign indicates that there is a net uptake of nitrogen from the mineral pool, i.e., net immobilization.\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value of $-1.125$ already has four significant figures ($1$, $1$, $2$, $5$). Therefore, no further rounding is necessary.",

It asks for a clear derivation, a specific calculation, and a conceptual explanation.

We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe stability of a numerical method for ODEs is analyzed using the scalar test equation:\n$$\ny'(t) = \\frac{dy}{dt} = \\lambda y(t)\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is a complex number. For the given problem, the eigenvalues $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$ are real and negative.\n\nThe explicit forward Euler method discretizes this ODE as:\n$$\ny_{n+1} = y_n + \\Delta t \\cdot y'(t_n)\n$$\nwhere $y_n$ is the numerical approximation of $y(t_n)$ at time $t_n$, and $\\Delta t$ is the time step. Substituting $y'(t_n) = \\lambda y_n$ into the update rule gives:\n$$\ny_{n+1} = y_n + \\Delta t (\\lambda y_n) = (1 + \\lambda \\Delta t) y_n\n$$\nThis is a geometric progression. For the numerical solution to remain bounded and not grow spuriously, the magnitude of the amplification factor, $g = 1 + \\lambda \\Delta t$, must be less than or equal to $1$. The condition for linear stability is therefore:\n$$\n|g| = |1 + \\lambda \\Delta t| \\leq 1\n$$\nThis inequality defines the region of absolute stability in the complex plane for the variable $z = \\lambda \\Delta t$. The region is a disk of radius $1$ centered at the point $(-1, 0)$.\n\nFor this specific problem, the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are real and negative. Let's analyze the stability condition $|1 + \\lambda \\Delta t| \\leq 1$ for a real, negative $\\lambda$. Since $\\Delta t  0$, the quantity $\\lambda \\Delta t$ is real and negative. The inequality is equivalent to:\n$$\n-1 \\leq 1 + \\lambda \\Delta t \\leq 1\n$$\nWe can split this into two separate inequalities:\n1. $1 + \\lambda \\Delta t \\leq 1 \\implies \\lambda \\Delta t \\leq 0$. Since $\\lambda  0$ and $\\Delta t  0$, this condition is always satisfied.\n2. $-1 \\leq 1 + \\lambda \\Delta t \\implies -2 \\leq \\lambda \\Delta t$.\n\nCombining these, the stability condition for a real, negative $\\lambda$ is $\\lambda \\Delta t \\geq -2$. Since $\\lambda$ is negative, we can divide by it and reverse the inequality sign to find the condition on the time step $\\Delta t$:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\leq -\\frac{2}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nFor a system of ODEs, the forward Euler method is stable if and only if this condition is met for every eigenvalue of the system's Jacobian matrix. The overall time step $\\Delta t$ must be small enough to satisfy the most restrictive constraint.\n$$\n\\Delta t \\leq \\min_{i} \\left( -\\frac{2}{\\lambda_i} \\right)\n$$\nWe are given two eigenvalues: $\\lambda_{1} = -0.1\\,\\mathrm{d^{-1}}$ and $\\lambda_{2} = -100\\,\\mathrm{d^{-1}}$.\n\nFor the slow mode associated with $\\lambda_1$:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\leq -\\frac{2}{\\lambda_1} = -\\frac{2}{-0.1\\,\\mathrm{d^{-1}}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{d}\n$$\nFor the fast mode associated with $\\lambda_2$:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\leq -\\frac{2}{\\lambda_2} = -\\frac{2}{-100\\,\\mathrm{d^{-1}}} = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{d}\n$$\nTo ensure stability for the entire system, $\\Delta t$ must satisfy both conditions simultaneously. Therefore, we must choose the smaller of the two upper bounds:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\leq \\min(20\\,\\mathrm{d}, 0.02\\,\\mathrm{d}) = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{d}\n$$\nThe maximum linearly stable time step is thus $\\Delta t_{\\max} = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{d}$. The problem requires this value to be rounded to three significant figures, which is $0.0200\\,\\mathrm{d}$.\n\nFinally, we address why an implicit method might be preferable. The system is considered \"stiff\" because of the large separation in time scales, characterized by the ratio of the eigenvalue magnitudes:\n$$\n\\text{Stiffness ratio} = \\frac{|\\lambda_2|}{|\\lambda_1|} = \\frac{|-100|}{|-0.1|} = 1000\n$$\nOur calculation shows that the stability of the explicit forward Euler method is severely constrained by the fastest, most rapidly decaying mode ($\\lambda_2 = -100\\,\\mathrm{d^{-1}}$), forcing the time step to be $\\Delta t \\leq 0.02\\,\\mathrm{d}$. However, this fast mode decays on a time scale of $\\tau_2 = 1/|\\lambda_2| = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{d}$, becoming negligible very quickly. The long-term dynamics of the system are governed by the slow mode ($\\lambda_1 = -0.1\\,\\mathrm{d^{-1}}$), which evolves on a much longer time scale of $\\tau_1 = 1/|\\lambda_1| = 10\\,\\mathrm{d}$. Using an explicit method requires taking a very small time step ($\\Delta t \\leq 0.02\\,\\mathrm{d}$) for the entire simulation duration, even when the solution is varying smoothly according to the slow mode. This is computationally inefficient.\n\nIn contrast, implicit methods like the backward Euler method, whose update rule is $y_{n+1} = y_n + \\Delta t f(t_{n+1}, y_{n+1})$, often have much larger regions of absolute stability. For backward Euler, the amplification factor is $g = (1 - \\lambda \\Delta t)^{-1}$. For any real, negative $\\lambda$ and any $\\Delta t  0$, we have $|g|  1$. This means the method is unconditionally stable for such problems. This property, known as A-stability, allows the time step $\\Delta t$ to be chosen based on the accuracy needed to resolve the slow dynamics of interest, rather than being dictated by the stability limit of the fast, irrelevant dynamics. While each step of an implicit method is computationally more expensive because it requires solving a system of (generally nonlinear) equations, the ability to take much larger time steps makes them far more efficient for stiff problems overall.",
