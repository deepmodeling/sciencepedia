            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of geophysical fluid dynamics, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is expressed in objective, precise terms.\n\nThe wind stress, $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$, represents the downward flux of horizontal momentum from the atmosphere to the sea surface. It is a force per unit area. The problem requires the derivation of an expression for $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ by invoking the quadratic drag closure, a widely used empirical parameterization for the air-sea momentum flux.\n\nThe physical basis for the quadratic drag law can be understood by considering the factors that determine the momentum transfer. The momentum of the air is proportional to its velocity, $\\mathbf{U_a}$, and its density, $\\rho_a$. The rate at which momentum is transferred to the surface is determined by the turbulent motions in the atmospheric boundary layer, which are primarily driven by the wind shear. The intensity of this turbulent exchange is proportional to the wind speed itself, $|\\mathbf{U_a}|$. Combining these factors, the momentum flux, or stress, is expected to be proportional to the product of the air density, the wind velocity, and the wind speed. This leads to the quadratic dependence on wind speed. The relationship is formalized by introducing a dimensionless drag coefficient, $C_D$, which accounts for the roughness of the sea surface and the efficiency of the turbulent momentum transport. For a neutrally stratified boundary layer, as specified in the problem, this relationship is given by the bulk aerodynamic formula:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\rho_a C_D |\\mathbf{U_a}| \\mathbf{U_a}\n$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{U_a}$ is the wind velocity vector at a specified reference height (in this case, $10\\ \\mathrm{m}$), $|\\mathbf{U_a}|$ is its magnitude, $\\rho_a$ is the air density, and $C_D$ is the neutral drag coefficient at that reference height. This expression constitutes the required derivation based on the problem statement.\n\nThe magnitude of the wind stress vector, $|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}|$, can be found by taking the magnitude of the expression above:\n$$\n|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}| = |\\rho_a C_D |\\mathbf{U_a}| \\mathbf{U_a}|\n$$\nSince $\\rho_a$, $C_D$, and $|\\mathbf{U_a}|$ are non-negative scalars, this simplifies to:\n$$\n|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}| = \\rho_a C_D |\\mathbf{U_a}|^2\n$$\nWe are given the following values:\nAir density, $\\rho_a = 1.2\\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$\nWind speed at $10\\ \\mathrm{m}$, $|\\mathbf{U_a}| = 12\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$\nNeutral drag coefficient, $C_D = 1.3 \\times 10^{-3}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for the magnitude of the wind stress:\n$$\n|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}| = (1.2\\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}) \\times (1.3 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times (12\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}})^2\n$$\n$$\n|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}| = (1.2 \\times 1.3 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times (144)\\ (\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-2}})\n$$\n$$\n|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}| = (1.56 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times 144\\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-1}\\,s^{-2}}\n$$\n$$\n|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}| = 0.22464\\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-1}\\,s^{-2}}\n$$\nThe unit $\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-1}\\,s^{-2}}$ is equivalent to $(\\mathrm{kg\\,m\\,s^{-2}})\\,\\mathrm{m^{-2}}$, which is $\\mathrm{N\\,m^{-2}}$.\nSo, $|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}| = 0.22464\\ \\mathrm{N\\,m^{-2}}$.\nRounding the result to three significant figures, as requested:\n$$\n|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}| \\approx 0.225\\ \\mathrm{N\\,m^{-2}}\n$$\n\nRegarding the orientation of the wind stress, the vector expression is $\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\rho_a C_D |\\mathbf{U_a}| \\mathbf{U_a}$. The term $\\rho_a C_D |\\mathbf{U_a}|$ is a positive scalar. Therefore, the wind stress vector $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ is in the same direction as the wind velocity vector $\\mathbf{U_a}$. The problem states that the wind blows \"strictly alongshore.\" Consequently, the wind stress vector $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ is also directed strictly alongshore. Physically, the momentum is transferred from the moving air to the water surface in the direction of the flow, causing the water to be dragged along in the same direction as the wind.",

All provided parameters are physically realistic, and the underlying model is the standard textbook formulation for an Ekman layer. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe governing equations for a steady, horizontally homogeneous flow in a rotating frame, under the Boussinesq approximation and with a constant vertical eddy viscosity $A_v$, are derived from the momentum equations. The flow is decomposed into a geostrophic component, which is in balance with the large-scale horizontal pressure gradient, and an ageostrophic (Ekman) component $(u,v)$, which is driven by the vertical friction. The equations for the Ekman velocity components are:\n$$\n-f v = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left( A_v \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} \\right) = A_v \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2}\n$$\n$$\nf u = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left( A_v \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial z} \\right) = A_v \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial z^2}\n$$\nwhere $u$ is the eastward velocity, $v$ is the northward velocity, and $f = 2\\Omega\\sin\\phi$ is the Coriolis parameter. We are in the Northern Hemisphere ($\\phi = 35^{\\circ} > 0$), so $f > 0$.\n\nTo solve this system, we introduce the complex velocity $W = u + iv$. Multiplying the second equation by the imaginary unit $i$ and adding it to the first equation gives:\n$$\n-fv + ifu = A_v \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2} + i A_v \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial z^2}\n$$\n$$\nif(u+iv) = A_v \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2} + i \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial z^2} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nifW = A_v \\frac{d^2 W}{d z^2}\n$$\nThis is a second-order ordinary differential equation for $W(z)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 W}{d z^2} - \\frac{if}{A_v} W = 0\n$$\nThe characteristic equation is $r^2 - \\frac{if}{A_v} = 0$, which gives $r^2 = \\frac{if}{A_v}$. The square roots of $i$ are $\\pm \\frac{1+i}{\\sqrt{2}}$. Thus, the characteristic roots are:\n$$\nr = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{f}{A_v}} \\frac{1+i}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\pm (1+i) \\sqrt{\\frac{f}{2A_v}}\n$$\nWe define the characteristic e-folding depth scale of the Ekman layer, $\\delta_E$, as:\n$$\n\\delta_E = \\sqrt{\\frac{2A_v}{f}}\n$$\nWith this definition, the roots become $r = \\pm \\frac{1+i}{\\delta_E}$.

The solution simplifies to:\n$$\nW(z) = C_1 \\exp\\left(\\frac{1+i}{\\delta_E} z\\right)\n$$\nThe second boundary condition is at the surface ($z=0$), where the turbulent stress must match the imposed wind stress $\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = (\\tau_x, \\tau_y)$. The vertical turbulent stress components are $\\tau_{zx} = \\rho A_v \\frac{du}{dz}$ and $\\tau_{zy} = \\rho A_v \\frac{dv}{dz}$.

At $z=0$:\n$$\n\\rho A_v C_1 \\frac{1+i}{\\delta_E} = \\tau_x + i\\tau_y\n$$\nSolving for $C_1$, which is the surface velocity $W(0)$:\n$$\nC_1 = W(0) = \\frac{\\delta_E (\\tau_x + i\\tau_y)}{\\rho A_v (1+i)}\n$$\nThe full solution for the Ekman spiral velocity profile is:\n$$\nW(z) = \\frac{\\delta_E (\\tau_x + i\\tau_y)}{\\rho A_v (1+i)} \\exp\\left(\\frac{z}{\\delta_E}\\right) \\exp\\left(i\\frac{z}{\\delta_E}\\right)\n$$\nThis describes a velocity vector that decays exponentially with depth and rotates clockwise (as $z$ becomes more negative) with respect to the surface current.\n\n(i) The e-folding depth scale of the Ekman layer, $\\delta_E$, is the depth over which the magnitude of the Ekman velocity decreases by a factor of $e^{-1}$. From its definition, the analytic expression is:\n$$\n\\delta_E = \\sqrt{\\frac{2A_v}{f}}\n$$\nwhere $f = 2\\Omega\\sin\\phi$.\n\n(ii) The depth-integrated Ekman transport per unit alongshore length, $\\mathbf{M}_E = (M_x, M_y)$, is found by integrating the velocity profile from the bottom of the layer ($z \\to -\\infty$) to the surface ($z=0$).

            "solution": "The problem is valid. It describes a physically consistent, albeit idealized, scenario of coastal upwelling based on fundamental principles of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics. All parameters are provided, are dimensionally consistent, and fall within realistic physical ranges. The problem is well-posed and allows for a unique solution.\n\nWe will address the two parts of the problem in sequence: the vertical uplift of the pycnocline and the change in Sea Surface Temperature (SST).\n\nFirst, we calculate the vertical uplift of the pycnocline. The problem states that tracers are advected materially, which means fluid parcels retain their properties (like density) as they move. The pycnocline, a surface of constant density, can therefore be treated as a material surface. The vertical motion of any fluid parcel on this surface is described by the kinematic equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dz_p}{dt} = w\n$$\nwhere $z_p(t)$ is the vertical position of a parcel on the pycnocline at time $t$, and $w$ is the vertical velocity.\n\nThe problem states that the vertical velocity $w$ is sustained uniformly and steadily. This means $w$ is constant in time. We can integrate the equation above with respect to time from $t=0$ to the final time $t$:\n$$\n\\int_{z_p(0)}^{z_p(t)} dz'_p = \\int_0^t w \\, dt'\n$$\nSince $w$ is a constant, the integration yields:\n$$\nz_p(t) - z_p(0) = w \\cdot t\n$$\nThe quantity $z_p(t) - z_p(0)$ is the total vertical displacement of the pycnocline, which we will denote as the uplift, $\\Delta z_p$.\n$$\n\\Delta z_p = w \\cdot t\n$$\nWe are given the values for $w$ and $t$:\n$w = 2 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$\n$t = 2\\ \\mathrm{days}$\n\nTo maintain consistent units, we must convert the duration $t$ from days to seconds:\n$$\nt = 2\\ \\mathrm{days} \\times \\frac{24\\ \\mathrm{hours}}{1\\ \\mathrm{day}} \\times \\frac{60\\ \\mathrm{minutes}}{1\\ \\mathrm{hour}} \\times \\frac{60\\ \\mathrm{seconds}}{1\\ \\mathrm{minute}} = 172800\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nNow, we can compute the uplift:\n$$\n\\Delta z_p = (2 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}) \\times (172800\\ \\mathrm{s}) = 3.456\\ \\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe initial pycnocline depth was $h=50\\ \\mathrm{m}$ (i.e., at $z=-50\\ \\mathrm{m}$). After an uplift of $3.456\\ \\mathrm{m}$, its new position is $z = -50\\ \\mathrm{m} + 3.456\\ \\mathrm{m} = -46.544\\ \\mathrm{m}$. This is still within the upper $60\\ \\mathrm{m}$ of the ocean, where the temperature gradient is defined, so our assumptions are consistent. The uplift is a positive quantity, $3.456\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the change in Sea Surface Temperature (SST). The governing equation for temperature $T$, assuming no diabatic processes (no heating or cooling by other means like radiation or mixing), is the advection equation, which states that the material derivative of temperature is zero:\n$$\n\\frac{DT}{Dt} = 0\n$$\nExpanding the material derivative gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla T = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{u}$ is the three-dimensional velocity field $(u, v, w)$ and $\\nabla T$ is the temperature gradient.

The equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = -w \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z}\n$$\nThis equation gives the local rate of change of temperature at a fixed point in space due to vertical advection. We are interested in the SST, which is the temperature at the sea surface, $z=0$. Let $T_{SST}(t) = T(z=0, t)$. The rate of change of SST is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{dT_{SST}}{dt} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} \\right)_{z=0} = -w \\left( \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z} \\right)_{z=0}\n$$\nWe are given that $w$ is constant and uniform ($w = 2 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$), and the vertical temperature gradient $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z}$ is uniform in the upper $60\\ \\mathrm{m}$ ($ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z} = 0.2\\ \\mathrm{K\\,m^{-1}}$). Since $z=0$ is within this layer, both values are constant at the surface. Therefore, the rate of change of SST is constant:\n$$\n\\frac{dT_{SST}}{dt} = -(2 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}) \\times (0.2\\ \\mathrm{K\\,m^{-1}}) = -4 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{K\\,s^{-1}}\n$$\nThe total change in SST, $\\Delta T_{SST}$, over the duration $t$ is the integral of this rate from $t=0$ to $t$:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{SST} = \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{dT_{SST}}{dt'} dt'\n$$\nSince the rate is constant, the integral is simply the rate multiplied by the duration:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{SST} = \\left(-w \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z}\\right) \\times t = (-4 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{K\\,s^{-1}}) \\times (172800\\ \\mathrm{s})\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta T_{SST} = -0.6912\\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates a cooling of the sea surface, which is the expected physical result of upwelling bringing colder, deeper water to the surface.\n\nThe problem requires the numerical results to be rounded to four significant figures.
