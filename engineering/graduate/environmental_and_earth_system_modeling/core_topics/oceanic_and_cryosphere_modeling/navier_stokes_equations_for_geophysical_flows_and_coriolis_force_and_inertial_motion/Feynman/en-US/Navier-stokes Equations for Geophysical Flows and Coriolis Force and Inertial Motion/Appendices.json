A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nWe begin with the momentum equation from Newton's second law for a fluid parcel in a rotating reference frame. Under the Boussinesq approximation, where density variations are neglected in the inertia term, the horizontal momentum equations are:\n\n$$\n\\frac{Du}{Dt} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0}\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} + fv + F_x\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{Dv}{Dt} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0}\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y} - fu + F_y\n$$\n\nHere, $\\frac{D}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + u\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + v\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + w\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$ is the material derivative, $(u,v)$ are the zonal (eastward) and meridional (northward) components of velocity, respectively, $p$ is the pressure, $\\rho_0$ is the constant reference density, and $f$ is the Coriolis parameter. The terms $F_x$ and $F_y$ represent frictional forces. The Coriolis force components are $(fv, -fu)$, consistent with a coordinate system on a plane tangent to the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nThe problem states to neglect several terms:\n1.  Unsteady terms: $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0$.\n2.  Nonlinear advection: $u\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + v\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + w\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} = 0$ when applied to the velocity components.\n3.  Frictional stresses: $F_x = 0$ and $F_y = 0$.\n\nApplying these simplifications, the material derivatives $\\frac{Du}{Dt}$ and $\\frac{Dv}{Dt}$ become zero. The momentum equations reduce to a simple diagnostic relationship known as geostrophic balance, where the pressure gradient force is exactly balanced by the Coriolis force.\n\nThe simplified equations are:\n$$\n0 = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0}\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} + fv\n$$\n$$\n0 = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0}\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y} - fu\n$$\n\nThe problem requires a solution for the meridional velocity, $v$. We can determine $v$ directly from the first of these two equations, the zonal momentum balance:\n$$\nfv = \\frac{1}{\\rho_0}\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}\n$$\n\nSolving for $v$, we obtain:\n$$\nv = \\frac{1}{f\\rho_0}\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n-   Coriolis parameter: $f = 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n-   Reference density: $\\rho_0 = 1025\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n-   Zonal pressure gradient: $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} = -10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n$$\nv = \\frac{1}{(10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (1025\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3})} \\times (-10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1})\n$$\n\nTo simplify the numerical part:\n$$\nv = \\frac{-10^{-3}}{10^{-4} \\times 1025} = \\frac{-10^{-3}}{0.1025} \\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nv = -\\frac{1}{102.5} \\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nv \\approx -0.00975609756... \\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $9$, $7$, $5$, and $6$. The subsequent digit is $0$, so we do not round up.\n$$\nv \\approx -0.009756 \\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the velocity is directed southward, which is consistent with the physics. In the Northern Hemisphere ($f>0$), a zonal pressure gradient that decreases to the east ($\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} < 0$) creates an eastward-directed pressure gradient force. This force must be balanced by a westward-directed Coriolis force. A southward flow ($v<0$) produces a Coriolis force component $fv$ that is negative, i.e., directed westward, thus achieving the required balance.\n\nExpressing the result in scientific notation as required for the final answer format gives:\n$$\nv = -9.756 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$",

We proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe equation of motion for a fluid parcel in a rotating reference frame is given by Newton's second law:\n$$ \\frac{D\\mathbf{u}}{Dt} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\nabla p - 2\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{g} + \\mathbf{F}_r $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity vector in the rotating frame, $\\frac{D}{Dt}$ is the material derivative, $\\rho$ is the density, $p$ is the pressure, $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}$ is the angular velocity vector of the Earth's rotation, $\\mathbf{g}$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $\\mathbf{F}_r$ represents frictional forces.\n\nWe apply the assumptions given in the problem. The motion is horizontal, so we consider the velocity components $(u, v)$ in the horizontal plane $(x, y)$. We use the traditional approximation, which neglects the vertical component of the Coriolis force. The horizontal components of the Coriolis acceleration, $-2\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{u}$, become $(fv, -fu)$, where $f=2|\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}|\\sin\\phi$ is the Coriolis parameter and $\\phi$ is the latitude. The problem states we are on an $f$-plane, meaning $f$ is constant.\n\nThe given assumptions simplify the governing equation as follows:\n-   Negligible horizontal pressure gradient: $\\nabla_h p = 0$.\n-   Negligible viscosity: $\\mathbf{F}_r = 0$.\n-   No other body forces are acting horizontally. The vertical force of gravity $\\mathbf{g}$ is balanced by the vertical pressure gradient, which is not relevant to the horizontal motion.\n\nThe material derivative $\\frac{D\\mathbf{u}}{Dt}$ for a parcel's trajectory simplifies to the ordinary derivative $\\frac{d\\mathbf{u}}{dt}$.\nThe horizontal momentum equations thus reduce to:\n$$ \\frac{du}{dt} = fv $$\n$$ \\frac{dv}{dt} = -fu $$\nThese two coupled ordinary differential equations describe inertial motion.\n\nFirst, we demonstrate that the speed magnitude $U = \\sqrt{u^2 + v^2}$ is constant. We examine the rate of change of the kinetic energy per unit mass, $\\frac{1}{2}U^2$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}U^2\\right) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(u^2 + v^2)\\right) = u\\frac{du}{dt} + v\\frac{dv}{dt} $$\nSubstituting the equations for $\\frac{du}{dt}$ and $\\frac{dv}{dt}$:\n$$ u(fv) + v(-fu) = fuv - fuv = 0 $$\nSince the time derivative of the kinetic energy is zero, the kinetic energy is a constant of motion. As the speed $U$ is non-negative, it must also be constant.\n\nNext, we solve the system of equations to find the trajectory. We can differentiate the first equation with respect to time and substitute the second equation:\n$$ \\frac{d^2u}{dt^2} = f\\frac{dv}{dt} = f(-fu) = -f^2 u $$\nThis gives the second-order homogeneous linear differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{d^2u}{dt^2} + f^2 u = 0 $$\nThe general solution for $u(t)$ is that of a simple harmonic oscillator:\n$$ u(t) = C_1 \\cos(ft) + C_2 \\sin(ft) $$\nWe find $v(t)$ using $v = \\frac{1}{f}\\frac{du}{dt}$:\n$$ v(t) = \\frac{1}{f}(-C_1 f \\sin(ft) + C_2 f \\cos(ft)) = -C_1 \\sin(ft) + C_2 \\cos(ft) $$\nTo determine the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$, we can set initial conditions. Let at $t=0$, the velocity be purely zonal, so $u(0)=U$ and $v(0)=0$.\n$$ u(0) = C_1 = U $$\n$$ v(0) = C_2 = 0 $$\nThe particular solutions for the velocity components are:\n$$ u(t) = U \\cos(ft) $$\n$$ v(t) = -U \\sin(ft) $$\nTo find the geometry of the trajectory, we integrate the velocity components with respect to time to get the position $(x(t), y(t))$:\n$$ x(t) = \\int u(t) dt = \\int U\\cos(ft) dt = \\frac{U}{f}\\sin(ft) + x_c $$\n$$ y(t) = \\int v(t) dt = \\int -U\\sin(ft) dt = \\frac{U}{f}\\cos(ft) + y_c $$\nwhere $(x_c, y_c)$ are constants of integration representing the center of the trajectory.\nLet's consider the position relative to this center:\n$$ (x(t) - x_c)^2 + (y(t) - y_c)^2 = \\left(\\frac{U}{f}\\sin(ft)\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{U}{f}\\cos(ft)\\right)^2 $$\n$$ (x(t) - x_c)^2 + (y(t) - y_c)^2 = \\left(\\frac{U}{f}\\right)^2 (\\sin^2(ft) + \\cos^2(ft)) = \\left(\\frac{U}{f}\\right)^2 $$\nThis is the equation of a circle with a constant radius $R$. The geometry of the inertial trajectory is a circle. This circle is referred to as an \"inertial circle\".\n\nThe radius of this circle is given by:\n$$ R = \\left|\\frac{U}{f}\\right| $$\nGiven that $U$ is a speed ($U \\ge 0$) and the problem provides a positive value for $f$, the radius is $R = \\frac{U}{f}$.\n\nNow we evaluate the radius for the given values:\n$U = 0.5 \\ \\mathrm{m}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$f = 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\n$$ R = \\frac{0.5 \\ \\mathrm{m}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 5000 \\ \\mathrm{m} $$\nThe problem requests the radius in kilometers (km). Since $1 \\ \\mathrm{km} = 1000 \\ \\mathrm{m}$:\n$$ R = 5000 \\ \\mathrm{m} = 5 \\ \\mathrm{km} $$\nRounding this result to four significant figures as requested gives $5.000 \\ \\mathrm{km}$.\n\nFinally, for the physical interpretation:\nOceanographic horizontal length scales are often categorized as submesoscale (roughly $0.1 - 10 \\ \\mathrm{km}$) and mesoscale (roughly $10 - 500 \\ \\mathrm{km}$). The calculated inertial radius of $R = 5 \\ \\mathrm{km}$ falls squarely within the submesoscale range. Inertial motion represents a purely ageostrophic flow, where the pressure gradient force is negligible and the dynamics are governed by the balance between acceleration and the Coriolis force. The Rossby number, $Ro = \\frac{U}{fL}$, which compares the magnitude of the inertial acceleration to the Coriolis force, is a key parameter for characterizing flow regimes. For inertial oscillations, the natural length scale is the radius of the circle itself, $L=R=\\frac{U}{f}$. Thus, the Rossby number for this motion is $Ro = \\frac{U}{f(U/f)} = 1$. A Rossby number of order unity is a defining characteristic of submesoscale dynamics, which contrasts with the quasi-geostrophic dynamics of the mesoscale where $Ro \\ll 1$. Therefore, inertial circles are a fundamental and energetic component of the submesoscale velocity field in the midlatitude ocean.",
