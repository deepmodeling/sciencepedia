The objective is to compare the magnitudes of two key terms in this balance: the meridional advection of planetary vorticity and the forcing by the wind-stress curl.\n\nThe governing equation for the steady, non-linear vorticity balance of a barotropic fluid, including wind forcing and bottom friction (not explicitly used here but relevant for context), is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla (\\zeta + f) = \\frac{(\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{\\tau})_z}{\\rho_0 H} - \\text{friction terms}\n$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{u}$ is the horizontal velocity vector, $\\zeta = \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{u}$ is the relative vorticity, $f$ is the planetary vorticity (Coriolis parameter), $\\rho_0$ is the reference density, $H$ is the layer thickness, and $(\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{\\tau})_z$ is the vertical component of the curl of the wind stress.

It is a standard textbook problem in physical oceanography.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe starting point is the steady, linear, barotropic vorticity equation, which balances the stretching of planetary vorticity by the flow, the curl of the wind stress, and the dissipation of relative vorticity by bottom friction. The equation is:\n$$\n\\beta v = \\frac{1}{\\rho_0 H} (\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{\\tau})_z - r \\zeta\n$$\nwhere $v$ is the meridional (northward) velocity, $\\beta$ is the constant planetary vorticity gradient, $\\rho_0$ is a reference density, $H$ is the constant basin depth, $(\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{\\tau})_z$ is the vertical component of the wind stress curl, $r$ is the linear bottom friction coefficient, and $\\zeta = (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{u})_z$ is the vertical component of the relative vorticity of the fluid.\n\nIn the broad ocean interior (the \"Sverdrup interior\"), frictional effects are assumed to be negligible. The balance is between planetary vorticity advection and wind stress curl, yielding the Sverdrup relation: $\\beta v_{int} = \\frac{1}{\\rho_0 H} (\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{\\tau})_z$. This interior flow, however, cannot satisfy the no-normal-flow boundary condition (i.e., zonal velocity $u=0$) at the western boundary of the basin ($x=0$). To satisfy this condition, a thin boundary layer must exist where other terms in the vorticity equation become important. This is the Western Boundary Current (WBC).\n\nWithin this thin WBC, we assume that the terms involving the velocity and its derivatives become much larger than in the interior. The dominant balance shifts to be between the advection of planetary vorticity and the bottom friction term. The wind stress curl term, which varies on the large scale of the ocean basin, is considered to be of the same order as in the interior and thus negligible compared to the two amplified terms. The leading-order vorticity balance in the WBC is therefore:\n$$\n\\beta v \\approx -r \\zeta\n$$\nThe relative vorticity is given by $\\zeta = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}$. The problem states that for a thin WBC, cross-stream derivatives (in the $x$-direction) dominate along-stream derivatives (in the $y$-direction). This means $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\gg \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$. Consequently, the relative vorticity can be approximated as:\n$$\n\\zeta \\approx \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}\n$$\nSubstituting this approximation into the WBC vorticity balance yields:\n$$\n\\beta v \\approx -r \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}\n$$\nTo find the characteristic width $\\delta$ of this boundary layer, we perform an order-of-magnitude scaling analysis. Let $V$ be the characteristic meridional velocity scale in the WBC and $\\delta$ be the characteristic width (the length scale for changes in the $x$-direction). The terms in the equation are scaled as follows:\n-   Planetary vorticity advection: $[\\beta v] \\sim \\beta V$\n-   Bottom friction: $\\left[-r \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}\\right] \\sim r \\frac{V}{\\delta}$\n\nEquating the magnitudes of these two dominant terms gives the scaling relationship:\n$$\n\\beta V \\sim r \\frac{V}{\\delta}\n$$\nAssuming $V \\neq 0$, we can cancel the velocity scale $V$ from both sides:\n$$\n\\beta \\sim \\frac{r}{\\delta}\n$$\nSolving for the width $\\delta$ provides the leading-order scaling:\n$$\n\\delta \\sim \\frac{r}{\\beta}\n$$\nTo be more formal, we can treat the approximate equation $\\beta v = -r \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}$ as a first-order ordinary differential equation for $v$ as a function of $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\beta}{r} v = 0\n$$\nThe general solution to this equation is $v(x) = C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta}{r}x\\right)$, where $C$ is a constant of integration determined by matching with the interior flow. This solution shows an exponential decay of the meridional velocity away from the western boundary at $x=0$. The e-folding cross-stream width, $\\delta$, is defined as the distance over which the velocity decreases by a factor of $e$. This occurs when the argument of the exponential equals $-1$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\beta}{r} \\delta = 1\n$$\nThis gives the precise expression for the e-folding width:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{r}{\\beta}\n$$\nNow, we evaluate this width using the provided numerical values: $r = 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $\\beta = 2 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{2 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 0.5 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 50000\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in kilometers, rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\n\\delta = 50000\\,\\mathrm{m} = 50\\,\\mathrm{km}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $50.0\\,\\mathrm{km}$.\n\nFinally, a brief assessment of this result's consistency with observations: The calculated width of $50.0\\,\\mathrm{km}$ is remarkably consistent with the observed widths of major mid-latitude western boundary currents, such as the Gulf Stream or the Kuroshio Current, which are typically on the order of $50\\,\\mathrm{km}$ to $100\\,\\mathrm{km}$. This agreement demonstrates that this highly simplified linear model successfully captures the fundamental length scale of western boundary current intensification.",
