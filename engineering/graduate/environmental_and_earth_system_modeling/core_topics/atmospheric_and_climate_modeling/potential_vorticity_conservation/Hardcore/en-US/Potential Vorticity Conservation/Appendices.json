            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of geophysical fluid dynamics, well-posed, and objective. We proceed by first deriving the conservation of potential vorticity for a single-layer shallow-water system.\n\nThe governing equations for an inviscid, hydrostatic, single-layer shallow-water fluid on a rotating plane are the momentum equations and the mass continuity equation. In a coordinate system where $x$ and $y$ are the horizontal coordinates and $\\mathbf{u} = (u,v)$ is the horizontal velocity vector, the equations are:\n\nMomentum equations:\n$$ \\frac{Du}{Dt} - fv = -g \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x} $$\n$$ \\frac{Dv}{Dt} + fu = -g \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y} $$\n\nMass continuity equation:\n$$ \\frac{Dh}{Dt} + h \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} \\right) = 0 $$\n\nHere, $\\frac{D}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + u\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + v\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$ is the material derivative, $h$ is the fluid layer thickness, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $f$ is the Coriolis parameter. For this problem, the flow is on an $f$-plane, meaning $f$ is a constant, $f=f_0$.\n\nTo derive the potential vorticity conservation law, we first derive the vorticity equation. The vertical component of relative vorticity is defined as $\\zeta = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}$. We take $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$ of the $v$-momentum equation and subtract $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$ of the $u$-momentum equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{Dv}{Dt}\\right) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{Du}{Dt}\\right) + \\frac{\\partial(fu)}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial(fv)}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(g \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y}\\right) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(g \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x}\\right) = 0 $$\nAfter expanding the advective terms, the left side can be manipulated to yield the evolution of relative vorticity. The term involving advection becomes:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{Dv}{Dt}\\right) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{Du}{Dt}\\right) = \\frac{D\\zeta}{Dt} + (\\zeta+f) \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} \\right) - \\left(u\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} + v\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right) $$\nSince we are on an $f$-plane ($f=f_0$), the gradients of $f$ are zero. The vorticity equation simplifies significantly to:\n$$ \\frac{D\\zeta}{Dt} + (\\zeta+f_0) \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} \\right) = 0 $$\nFrom the mass continuity equation, the horizontal divergence is given by $\\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} \\right) = -\\frac{1}{h}\\frac{Dh}{Dt}$. Substituting this into the vorticity equation:\n$$ \\frac{D\\zeta}{Dt} + (\\zeta+f_0) \\left( -\\frac{1}{h}\\frac{Dh}{Dt} \\right) = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{D\\zeta}{Dt} = \\frac{\\zeta+f_0}{h} \\frac{Dh}{Dt} $$\nRearranging this equation gives:\n$$ h \\frac{D\\zeta}{Dt} - (\\zeta+f_0) \\frac{Dh}{Dt} = 0 $$\nSince $f_0$ is a constant, $\\frac{Df_0}{Dt} = 0$, so $\\frac{D\\zeta}{Dt} = \\frac{D(\\zeta+f_0)}{Dt}$. The expression is:\n$$ h \\frac{D(\\zeta+f_0)}{Dt} - (\\zeta+f_0) \\frac{Dh}{Dt} = 0 $$\nDividing by $h^2$ (assuming $h \\neq 0$), we obtain:\n$$ \\frac{h \\frac{D(\\zeta+f_0)}{Dt} - (\\zeta+f_0) \\frac{Dh}{Dt}}{h^2} = 0 $$\nThis is, by the quotient rule for differentiation, the material derivative of the quantity $\\frac{\\zeta+f_0}{h}$:\n$$ \\frac{D}{Dt} \\left( \\frac{\\zeta+f_0}{h} \\right) = 0 $$\nThis establishes that the quantity $q = \\frac{\\zeta+f_0}{h}$ is materially conserved for any fluid parcel. This quantity $q$ is the shallow-water potential vorticity (PV). The term $\\zeta_a = \\zeta + f_0$ is the absolute vorticity. Thus, potential vorticity is the ratio of the absolute vorticity to the fluid layer thickness, $q = \\frac{\\zeta_a}{h}$.\n\nNow, we apply this conservation principle to the problem.\nThe upstream flow has uniform layer thickness $H$, uniform relative vorticity $\\zeta_0$, and constant Coriolis parameter $f_0$. The potential vorticity $q$ of the upstream flow is therefore:\n$$ q = \\frac{\\zeta_0 + f_0}{H} $$\n\nAs fluid parcels flow from upstream to downstream across the ridge, their potential vorticity is conserved. Let the upstream and downstream states be denoted by subscripts 'up' and 'down'.\n$$ q_{\\mathrm{up}} = q_{\\mathrm{down}} $$\nThe absolute vorticity upstream is $\\zeta_{a,\\mathrm{up}} = \\zeta_0 + f_0$. The layer thickness is $h_{\\mathrm{up}} = H$. So,\n$$ q_{\\mathrm{up}} = \\frac{\\zeta_{a,\\mathrm{up}}}{h_{\\mathrm{up}}} = \\frac{\\zeta_0 + f_0}{H} $$\nDownstream, the layer thickness is reduced to $h_{\\mathrm{down}} = 0.9H$. The absolute vorticity is $\\zeta_{a,\\mathrm{down}}$. Therefore,\n$$ q_{\\mathrm{down}} = \\frac{\\zeta_{a,\\mathrm{down}}}{h_{\\mathrm{down}}} = \\frac{\\zeta_{a,\\mathrm{down}}}{0.9H} $$\nEquating the upstream and downstream potential vorticities:\n$$ \\frac{\\zeta_0 + f_0}{H} = \\frac{\\zeta_{a,\\mathrm{down}}}{0.9H} $$\nWe solve for the downstream absolute vorticity, $\\zeta_{a,\\mathrm{down}}$:\n$$ \\zeta_{a,\\mathrm{down}} = (\\zeta_0 + f_0) \\frac{0.9H}{H} = 0.9(\\zeta_0 + f_0) $$\n\nPhysically, the conservation of potential vorticity, $q = \\zeta_a / h$, implies a direct relationship between the absolute vorticity and the thickness of the fluid column. If a column of fluid is vertically compressed (its thickness $h$ decreases), its absolute vorticity $\\zeta_a$ must decrease proportionally to keep $q$ constant. This phenomenon is known as \"vortex squashing\". Conversely, if the column is stretched vertically ($h$ increases), its absolute vorticity must increase (\"vortex stretching\").\n\nIn this problem, the jet crosses a ridge, causing the layer thickness to decrease from $H$ to $h_{\\mathrm{down}} = 0.9H$. This vertical compression forces the absolute vorticity to decrease. Our result confirms this: the downstream absolute vorticity $\\zeta_{a,\\mathrm{down}}$ is $0.9$ times the upstream absolute vorticity $(\\zeta_0 + f_0)$. This reduction in absolute vorticity is a direct consequence of the conservation of angular momentum for the fluid column as its vertical extent is reduced.",

Thus, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution is provided below.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n1.  Derivation of the relative vorticity, $\\zeta(y)$.\nThe vertical component of the relative vorticity, $\\zeta$, is defined in Cartesian coordinates as $\\zeta = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}$. The problem provides a purely zonal flow, with the velocity components given by $u(y) = U_{0} \\exp(-y^{2}/L^{2})$ and $v(y) = 0$. Since $v$ is identically zero, its partial derivative with respect to $x$ is also zero: $\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = 0$.

Construction of the absolute vorticity, $\\eta(y)$.\nThe absolute vorticity $\\eta(y)$ is the sum of the planetary vorticity $f(y)$ and the relative vorticity $\\zeta(y)$. The planetary vorticity is given by the Coriolis parameter on a $\\beta$-plane, $f(y) = f_{0} + \\beta y$. Combining this with the result from part 1, we get:\n$$\n\\eta(y) = f(y) + \\zeta(y) = \\left(f_{0} + \\beta y\\right) + \\frac{2 U_{0} y}{L^{2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y^{2}}{L^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nThe planetary vorticity term $\\beta y$ introduces a background linear gradient to the vorticity field. While the relative vorticity $\\zeta(y)$ is localized and shaped by the shear of the jet (being zero at the jet axis $y=0$ and antisymmetric about it), the planetary vorticity component provides a large-scale, monotonically increasing background. The superposition of these two effects means the absolute vorticity $\\eta(y)$ is no longer symmetric about the jet axis; its structure is tilted by the planetary vorticity gradient.\n\n3.  Calculation of the meridional potential vorticity (PV) gradient and critical layer positions.\nThe barotropic shallow-water potential vorticity (PV) for a fluid of constant thickness $H$ is defined as $q(y) = \\frac{\\eta(y)}{H}$. To find the meridional locations $y_{c}$ where the meridional PV gradient is zero, we must compute $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}q}{\\mathrm{d}y}$ and set it to $0$. Since $H$ is a constant, this is equivalent to finding where $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\eta}{\\mathrm{d}y} = 0$.\nWe first compute the derivative of the absolute vorticity $\\eta(y)$ with respect to $y$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\eta}{\\mathrm{d}y} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}y} \\left( f_{0} + \\beta y + \\zeta(y) \\right) = \\beta + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\zeta}{\\mathrm{d}y}\n$$\nNext, we differentiate the relative vorticity $\\zeta(y)$ using the product rule:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\zeta}{\\mathrm{d}y} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}y} \\left( \\frac{2 U_{0} y}{L^{2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y^{2}}{L^{2}}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{2 U_{0}}{L^{2}} \\left[ 1 \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y^{2}}{L^{2}}\\right) + y \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y^{2}}{L^{2}}\\right) \\left(-\\frac{2y}{L^{2}}\\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\zeta}{\\mathrm{d}y} = \\frac{2 U_{0}}{L^{2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y^{2}}{L^{2}}\\right) \\left( 1 - \\frac{2y^{2}}{L^{2}} \\right)\n$$\nNow, we set the total PV gradient to zero at the critical positions $y = y_{c}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\eta}{\\mathrm{d}y} \\bigg|_{y=y_{c}} = \\beta + \\frac{2 U_{0}}{L^{2}} \\left( 1 - \\frac{2y_{c}^{2}}{L^{2}} \\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y_{c}^{2}}{L^{2}}\\right) = 0\n$$\nThis is a transcendental equation for $y_{c}$.

The relative vorticity is $\\zeta = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}$. In the specified $1$D flow, the cross-stream velocity is $v=0$, and lateral derivatives vanish ($\\partial/\\partial y = 0$). Therefore, the relative vorticity is $\\zeta = 0$ in the uniform flow regions both upstream and downstream of the bore.\n\nThe potential vorticity in the two states is:\n- Upstream: $q_{1} = \\frac{0 + f}{h_{1}} = \\frac{f}{h_{1}}$\n- Downstream: $q_{2} = \\frac{0 + f}{h_{2}} = \\frac{f}{h_{2}}$\n\nThe jump in potential vorticity is $\\Delta q = q_{2} - q_{1}$:\n$$ \\Delta q = \\frac{f}{h_{2}} - \\frac{f}{h_{1}} = f \\left( \\frac{1}{h_{2}} - \\frac{1}{h_{1}} \\right) $$\nSubstituting $h_2 = r h_1$:\n$$ \\Delta q = f \\left( \\frac{1}{r h_{1}} - \\frac{1}{h_{1}} \\right) = \\frac{f}{h_{1}} \\left( \\frac{1}{r} - 1 \\right) = \\frac{f}{h_{1}} \\frac{1-r}{r} $$\nNow we substitute the expression for $r$ in terms of $Fr_{1}$:\n$$ \\Delta q = \\frac{f}{h_{1}} \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{2}(\\sqrt{1 + 8Fr_{1}^{2}} - 1)}{\\frac{1}{2}(\\sqrt{1 + 8Fr_{1}^{2}} - 1)} $$\n$$ \\Delta q = \\frac{f}{h_{1}} \\frac{\\frac{2 - (\\sqrt{1 + 8Fr_{1}^{2}} - 1)}{2}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{1 + 8Fr_{1}^{2}} - 1}{2}} $$\n$$ \\Delta q = \\frac{f}{h_{1}} \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{1 + 8Fr_{1}^{2}}}{\\sqrt{1 + 8Fr_{1}^{2}} - 1} $$\nFor a hydraulic jump, $Fr_{1}1$, which implies $r1$ and thus $q_2  q_1$, so $\\Delta q  0$ (for $f0, h_10$). This means that potential vorticity is not conserved across the shock.\n\n### Explanation of PV Conservation and Non-conservation\n\nPotential vorticity is materially conserved ($Dq/Dt = 0$) in smooth, inviscid, adiabatic flows. This conservation law is derived from the differential form of the governing equations (mass and momentum conservation). The derivation involves taking spatial derivatives of the velocity and height fields. For instance, the derivation of the vorticity equation, $\\frac{D(\\zeta+f)}{Dt} = -(\\zeta+f)(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u})$, requires that the velocity field be continuously differentiable.\n\nA shock or hydraulic bore is, by definition, a discontinuity. At the location of the shock, the fluid properties ($u, h$) are not continuous, let alone differentiable. Therefore, the derivation of PV conservation is mathematically invalid across the shock front. One must revert to the fundamental integral conservation laws.\n\nThe jump conditions across the shock enforce conservation of mass and momentum flux. However, they do not enforce conservation of energy. In fact, mechanical energy is dissipated into heat through turbulence and viscous effects within the infinitesimally thin, unresolved structure of the shock. The loss of energy can be shown by calculating the change in the Bernoulli function, $B = u^2/(2g) + h$, which is found to be negative across a hydraulic jump ($\\Delta B  0$).\n\nThe conservation of potential vorticity in smooth flow is a consequence of a delicate balance between vorticity production by vortex stretching/compression (related to mass conservation) and vorticity production by baroclinicity or, in this case, the pressure gradient (related to momentum conservation). The dissipative, irreversible processes within the shock break this balance. The mathematical manifestation of this is the failure of the smooth equations at the discontinuity. Thus, while mass and momentum are conserved in their flux forms, derived quantities like potential vorticity, whose conservation depends on the smooth interplay between the primitive equations, are not conserved. The non-zero value of $\\Delta q$ calculated above is a direct measure of this non-conservation.",
