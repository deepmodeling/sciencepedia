The physical setup is realistic and serves as a foundational model for understanding orographic drag. The problem is firmly scientifically grounded.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a complete set of governing equations and a well-defined boundary condition. The request to find the momentum flux is a standard calculation that follows from solving the system. An implicit upper boundary condition (the radiation condition) is required for a unique solution, which is standard practice for such problems to ensure that wave energy propagates away from the source (the mountain) at high altitudes.\n3.  **Objective**: The language is precise, quantitative, and free of any subjectivity or bias.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency**: The provided equations and conditions are consistent and sufficient to derive the requested quantities. The problem explicitly states to adopt the hydrostatic approximation, which resolves any ambiguity about which set of equations to use. The numerical values are physically plausible for Earth's atmosphere.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of Momentum Flux\nWe seek the phase-averaged vertical flux of horizontal momentum, $\\mathcal{F}_M = \\rho\\,\\overline{u'w'}$. The overbar denotes a spatial average over one horizontal wavelength. The perturbations $u'$ (horizontal velocity) and $w'$ (vertical velocity) are solutions to the given linear system.\n\nWe assume solutions of the form $f'(x,z) = \\Re\\{\\hat{f}(z)e^{ikx}\\}$, where $\\hat{f}(z)$ is the complex amplitude of the perturbation variable $f'$. Substituting this form into the governing differential equations yields a set of equations for the complex amplitudes:\n1.  Horizontal momentum: $U(ik\\hat{u}) = -\\frac{1}{\\rho}(ik\\hat{p}) \\implies \\hat{p} = -\\rho U \\hat{u}$.\n2.  Buoyancy: $U(ik\\hat{b}) + N^2\\hat{w} = 0 \\implies \\hat{b} = \\frac{iN^2}{Uk}\\hat{w}$.\n3.  Hydrostatic balance: $\\frac{d\\hat{p}}{dz} = \\rho \\hat{b}$.\n4.  Continuity: $ik\\hat{u} + \\frac{d\\hat{w}}{dz} = 0$.\n\nWe combine these equations to find a single governing equation for $\\hat{w}(z)$. Differentiating the horizontal momentum equation (1) with respect to $z$ gives $\\frac{d\\hat{p}}{dz} = -\\rho U \\frac{d\\hat{u}}{dz}$.\nSubstituting this and the buoyancy relation (2) into the hydrostatic equation (3) gives:\n$-\\rho U \\frac{d\\hat{u}}{dz} = \\rho \\left(\\frac{iN^2}{Uk}\\hat{w}\\right) \\implies \\frac{d\\hat{u}}{dz} = -\\frac{iN^2}{U^2k}\\hat{w}$.\nFrom the continuity equation (4), we have $\\hat{u} = \\frac{i}{k}\\frac{d\\hat{w}}{dz}$. Differentiating this with respect to $z$ yields $\\frac{d\\hat{u}}{dz} = \\frac{i}{k}\\frac{d^2\\hat{w}}{dz^2}$.\nEquating the two expressions for $\\frac{d\\hat{u}}{dz}$:\n$\\frac{i}{k}\\frac{d^2\\hat{w}}{dz^2} = -\\frac{iN^2}{U^2k}\\hat{w}$.\nMultiplying by $k/i$ simplifies this to the Taylor-Goldstein equation for hydrostatic flow:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\hat{w}}{dz^2} + \\frac{N^2}{U^2}\\hat{w} = 0\n$$\nThis is a second-order ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. Let $m^2 = (N/U)^2$. The general solution is $\\hat{w}(z) = A e^{imz} + B e^{-imz}$. For a physically meaningful solution, wave energy must propagate upward, away from the topography. For a stationary wave ($U>0$, $k>0$), this radiation condition requires that we select the solution with upward group velocity, which corresponds to downward phase velocity, meaning we choose the positive root for the vertical wavenumber, $m = N/U$. The solution is thus $\\hat{w}(z) = A e^{imz}$.\n\nThe constant $A$ is determined by the lower boundary condition at $z=0$: $w(x,0) = U \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x}$.\nGiven $h(x)=H\\cos(kx)$, we have $\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x} = -Hk\\sin(kx)$.\nSo, $w(x,0) = -UHk\\sin(kx)$.\nWe can write this in complex form: $w(x,0) = \\Re\\{iUHke^{ikx}\\}$.\nAlso, from our assumed solution form, $w(x,0) = \\Re\\{\\hat{w}(0)e^{ikx}\\} = \\Re\\{Ae^{ikx}\\}$.\nComparing the two expressions, we find the amplitude at the boundary: $A = \\hat{w}(0) = iUHk$.\nThus, the solution for the vertical velocity amplitude is:\n$$\n\\hat{w}(z) = iUHk e^{imz}, \\quad \\text{where } m = \\frac{N}{U}\n$$\nNext, we find the horizontal velocity amplitude $\\hat{u}(z)$ using the continuity equation, $\\hat{u} = \\frac{i}{k}\\frac{d\\hat{w}}{dz}$:\n$\\frac{d\\hat{w}}{dz} = \\frac{d}{dz}(iUHk e^{imz}) = (iUHk)(im)e^{imz} = -UHkm e^{imz}$.\nSubstituting $m=N/U$: $\\frac{d\\hat{w}}{dz} = -UHk(N/U)e^{imz} = -NHk e^{imz}$.\nThen, $\\hat{u}(z) = \\frac{i}{k}(-NHk e^{imz}) = -iNH e^{imz}$.\n\nNow we can compute the phase-averaged momentum flux. For two quantities $a = \\Re\\{\\hat{a}e^{ikx}\\}$ and $b = \\Re\\{\\hat{b}e^{ikx}\\}$, the phase average of their product is $\\overline{ab} = \\frac{1}{2}\\Re\\{\\hat{a}\\hat{b}^*\\}$, where $\\hat{b}^*$ is the complex conjugate of $\\hat{b}$.\nWe have $\\hat{u}(z) = -iNH e^{imz}$ and $\\hat{w}(z) = iUHk e^{imz}$.\nThe complex conjugate of $\\hat{w}$ is $\\hat{w}^*(z) = -iUHk e^{-imz}$.\nThe product is:\n$\\hat{u}\\hat{w}^* = (-iNH e^{imz})(-iUHk e^{-imz}) = i^2 (NH)(UHk) e^{imz-imz} = -NUH^2k$.\nThe average product $\\overline{u'w'}$ is:\n$$\n\\overline{u'w'} = \\frac{1}{2}\\Re\\{-NUH^2k\\} = -\\frac{1}{2}NUH^2k\n$$\nThis quantity is independent of height $z$, consistent with an inviscid, steady flow. The vertical flux of horizontal momentum is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}_M = \\rho\\,\\overline{u'w'} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\rho N U k H^2\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates a downward flux of positive (eastward) momentum, which exerts a drag force on the mountain.\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\nWe are asked to evaluate the signed surface momentum flux for the given parameters:\n- $\\rho = 0.9\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n- $U = 15\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $N = 0.012\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $H = 300\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $\\lambda = 20\\,\\mathrm{km} = 2 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the horizontal wavenumber $k$:\n$$\nk = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} = \\frac{2\\pi}{2 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{m}} = \\pi \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\n$$\nNow, substitute these values into the expression for the momentum flux:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}_M = -\\frac{1}{2} (0.9\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}) (0.012\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) (15\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) (\\pi \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}) (300\\,\\mathrm{m})^2\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}_M = - \\frac{1}{2} (0.9)(0.012)(15)(\\pi \\times 10^{-4})(9 \\times 10^4) \\,\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\n$$\nThe powers of $10$ cancel out.

You are given a stratification profile $N(z)$, a background wind profile $U(z)$ aligned with the horizontal wavenumber vector, and a discrete set of terrain spectral components characterized by horizontal wavenumber $k$ and terrain amplitude $h_0$. From the fundamental base comprising (i) the Boussinesq continuity and momentum equations, (ii) the internal gravity wave dispersion relation for two-dimensional stationary waves, and (iii) the conservation of wave action in slowly varying media, derive the expressions necessary to compute the vertical wavenumber $m(z)$, the vertical flux of horizontal momentum (also called Eliassen-Palm flux) and the saturation criterion. Using those expressions, implement an algorithm to vertically propagate each spectral component from the lower boundary upward through a discrete grid until wave breaking (saturation) or a critical level is encountered, and compute the resulting vertical distribution of momentum deposition.\n\nThe algorithmic requirements are as follows:\n\n- Start from fundamental laws and core definitions to derive the governing relations needed for vertical propagation of stationary internal gravity waves forced by orography. Do not use pre-packaged or shortcut formulas that are not derived from the fundamental base.\n- Assume a constant reference density $\\rho_0$ and use the two-dimensional, non-rotating, hydrostatic-consistent limit of the Boussinesq framework appropriate for mountain waves.\n- Implement vertical propagation on a uniform grid $z_i$ from $z=0$ to $z=10{,}000$ meters at $1{,}000$ meters spacing. At each level, determine whether the internal gravity wave is able to propagate ($m^2(z_i) > 0$), whether it encounters a turning level ($m^2(z_i) \\le 0$), whether it saturates according to a physically motivated nonlinearity threshold, or whether it encounters a critical level (defined when the intrinsic phase speed vanishes due to $|U(z_i)|$ crossing below a small threshold).\n- For each spectral component with parameters $k$ and $h_0$, initialize the upward vertical flux of horizontal momentum at the lower boundary using the appropriate relations derived from the fundamental base. Under the assumption of adiabatic propagation in the absence of breaking or critical levels, this flux is conserved with height. When saturation occurs (based on a derived nonlinearity parameter reaching unity), or a critical level is encountered (based on a threshold for $|U(z)|$), or a turning level is reached ($m^2(z) \\le 0$), deposit the remaining upward flux locally at that level.

The reference density is a constant $\\rho_0$.\n\nThe linearized momentum equations are:\n$$ U \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial x} + w' \\frac{dU}{dz} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0}\\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial x} \\quad (1) $$\n$$ U \\frac{\\partial w'}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0}\\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial z} - \\frac{\\rho' g}{\\rho_0} \\quad (2) $$\nThe continuity equation is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial w'}{\\partial z} = 0 \\quad (3) $$\nThe thermodynamic equation, representing conservation of density for a fluid parcel, is:\n$$ U \\frac{\\partial \\rho'}{\\partial x} + w' \\frac{d\\bar{\\rho}}{dz} = 0 \\quad (4) $$\nWe define the Brunt-Väisälä frequency $N$ by $N^2(z) = -\\frac{g}{\\rho_0}\\frac{d\\bar{\\rho}}{dz}$. Using this, equation $(4)$ becomes:\n$$ U \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(-\\frac{\\rho' g}{\\rho_0}\\right) - w' N^2 = 0 \\quad (5) $$\n\n**2. Derivation of the Taylor-Goldstein Equation**\n\nWe seek wave-like solutions of the form $\\psi'(x,z) = \\Re\\{\\hat{\\psi}(z) e^{ikx}\\}$ for any perturbation variable $\\psi'$, where $k$ is the horizontal wavenumber. Substituting this form into the linearized equations yields a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the complex amplitudes $\\hat{u}(z), \\hat{w}(z), \\hat{p}(z), \\hat{\\rho}(z)$:\n$$ ikU\\hat{u} + \\hat{w}\\frac{dU}{dz} = -\\frac{ik}{\\rho_0}\\hat{p} \\quad (6) $$\n$$ ikU\\hat{w} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0}\\frac{d\\hat{p}}{dz} - \\frac{\\hat{\\rho}g}{\\rho_0} \\quad (7) $$\n$$ ik\\hat{u} + \\frac{d\\hat{w}}{dz} = 0 \\quad (8) $$\n$$ ikU\\left(-\\frac{\\hat{\\rho}g}{\\rho_0}\\right) - \\hat{w} N^2 = 0 \\quad (9) $$\n\nFrom $(8)$, we express $\\hat{u}$ in terms of $\\hat{w}$: $\\hat{u} = \\frac{i}{k}\\frac{d\\hat{w}}{dz}$.\nFrom $(9)$, we express the buoyancy term in terms of $\\hat{w}$: $-\\frac{\\hat{\\rho}g}{\\rho_0} = \\frac{N^2}{ikU}\\hat{w}$.\n\nSubstitute $\\hat{u}$ into $(6)$ to solve for $\\hat{p}$:\n$$ \\hat{p} = \\rho_0 \\left( \\frac{U}{k^2}\\frac{d\\hat{w}}{dz} - \\frac{i}{k}\\frac{dU}{dz}\\hat{w} \\right) $$\nNow, differentiate $\\hat{p}$ with respect to $z$ and substitute it, along with the expression for buoyancy, into $(7)$:\n$$ ikU\\hat{w} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\frac{d}{dz} \\left[ \\rho_0 \\left( \\frac{U}{k^2}\\frac{d\\hat{w}}{dz} - \\frac{i}{k}\\frac{dU}{dz}\\hat{w} \\right) \\right] + \\frac{N^2}{ikU}\\hat{w} $$\nAfter expanding the derivative and rearranging terms, we obtain the Taylor-Goldstein equation:\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\hat{w}}{dz^2} + \\left( \\frac{N^2}{U^2} - k^2 - \\frac{U_{zz}}{U} \\right) \\hat{w} = 0 $$\nwhere $U_{zz} = d^2U/dz^2$.\n\n**3. Vertical Wavenumber, $m(z)$**\n\nThe problem specifies analysis for a \"slowly varying media\", which corresponds to the WKB approximation. In this limit, the term involving the curvature of the wind profile, $U_{zz}/U$, is negligible compared to the other terms. The governing equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\hat{w}}{dz^2} + m^2(z)\\hat{w} = 0 $$\nThis is the equation for a harmonic oscillator with a spatially varying frequency. The local vertical wavenumber, $m(z)$, is defined by:\n$$ m^2(z) = \\frac{N(z)^2}{U(z)^2} - k^2 $$\nFor a wave to propagate vertically, its solution must be oscillatory in $z$, which requires $m^2(z) > 0$. If $m^2(z) \\le 0$, the solution is evanescent, and the wave cannot propagate. This condition, $m^2(z) \\le 0$, defines a **turning level**.\n\n**4. Vertical Flux of Horizontal Momentum**\n\nThe vertical flux of horizontal momentum per unit area is given by $F_m = \\rho_0 \\overline{u'w'}$, where the overbar denotes a horizontal average over one wavelength. We introduce the vertical parcel displacement $\\eta'(x, z)$. For small displacements, the vertical velocity is the total derivative of the displacement: $w' = \\frac{D\\eta'}{Dt} = (\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + U\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x})\\eta'$. For stationary waves ($\\partial/\\partial t = 0$), this simplifies to $w' = U\\frac{\\partial \\eta'}{\\partial x}$. For a single Fourier mode $\\eta'(x,z) = \\Re\\{\\hat{\\eta}(z) e^{ikx}\\}$, we have $\\hat{w}(z) = ikU(z)\\hat{\\eta}(z)$.\n\nThe kinematic boundary condition at the surface ($z=0$) forces the flow to follow the terrain $h(x)$. Thus, $\\eta'(x,0) = h(x)$. For a spectral component $h(x) = h_0 \\cos(kx)$, the complex amplitude of the displacement at the surface is $\\hat{\\eta}(0) = h_0$.\n\nTo find the momentum flux, we need to relate $u'$ and $\\eta'$. Combining the continuity equation $(3)$ and the relation between $w'$ and $\\eta'$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{\\partial w'}{\\partial z} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\left(U\\frac{\\partial \\eta'}{\\partial x}\\right) = -U\\frac{\\partial^2 \\eta'}{\\partial x \\partial z} - \\frac{dU}{dz}\\frac{\\partial \\eta'}{\\partial x} $$\nIntegrating with respect to $x$ gives $u' = -U\\frac{\\partial \\eta'}{\\partial z} - \\frac{dU}{dz}\\eta'$. For upward energy propagation, the vertical structure of $\\eta'$ is proportional to $e^{imz}$. Under the WKB approximation ($\\partial_z \\gg \\frac{1}{U}\\frac{dU}{dz}$ etc.), we have $\\frac{\\partial \\eta'}{\\partial z} \\approx im\\eta'$, leading to $\\hat{u} \\approx -imU\\hat{\\eta}$.\n\nThe momentum flux is then:\n$F_m = \\rho_0 \\overline{u'w'} = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho_0 \\Re\\{\\hat{u}(ikU\\hat{\\eta})^*\\} = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho_0 \\Re\\{(-imU\\hat{\\eta})(-ikU\\hat{\\eta}^*)\\} = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho_0 \\Re\\{-mkU^2|\\hat{\\eta}|^2\\}$.\n$$ F_m(z) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\rho_0 m(z) k U(z)^2 |\\hat{\\eta}(z)|^2 $$\nThe negative sign indicates a downward flux of horizontal momentum, which corresponds to a drag on the surface. For an upward propagating wave launched from the ground, the magnitude of this flux at the surface ($z=0$), denoted $J_0$, is:\n$$ J_0 = |F_m(0)| = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho_0 m_0 k U_0^2 h_0^2 $$\nwhere $U_0 = U(0)$, $N_0 = N(0)$, and $m_0 = \\sqrt{N_0^2/U_0^2 - k^2}$.\nFor a steady, non-dissipating wave, the vertical flux of horizontal momentum is conserved with height, i.e., $F_m(z) = F_m(0)$. Therefore, the magnitude $J(z) = J_0$ remains constant until the wave encounters a critical level, turning level, or breaks.\n\n**5. Saturation Criterion**\n\nWave breaking (saturation) occurs when the wave amplitude becomes too large, leading to convective instability. This happens when the total potential temperature gradient $\\partial\\theta/\\partial z$ becomes non-positive. This is equivalent to the condition $\\partial b/\\partial z \\le 0$ on the buoyancy $b = \\bar{b}(z)+b'(x,z)$. The onset criterion is $\\partial b'/\\partial z \\ge N^2$.\n\nFrom the thermodynamic equation $(5)$, we found $b' = -N^2\\eta'$. The saturation criterion is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(-N^2 \\eta') \\ge N^2 \\implies -N^2 \\frac{\\partial \\eta'}{\\partial z} \\ge N^2 \\implies \\frac{\\partial \\eta'}{\\partial z} \\le -1 $$\nThe amplitude of the vertical gradient of displacement is $|\\frac{\\partial \\eta'}{\\partial z}| \\approx |im\\eta'| = m|\\hat{\\eta}|$. Thus, saturation occurs when the nonlinearity parameter $S(z) = m(z)|\\hat{\\eta}(z)|$ reaches a value of order unity. We set the threshold at $S(z) \\ge 1$.\n\nTo evaluate $S(z)$, we find $|\\hat{\\eta}(z)|$ from the conservation of momentum flux magnitude: $J_0 = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho_0 m(z) k U(z)^2 |\\hat{\\eta}(z)|^2$.\n$$ |\\hat{\\eta}(z)|^2 = \\frac{2 J_0}{\\rho_0 k m(z) U(z)^2} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $S(z)$:\n$$ S(z) = m(z) \\sqrt{\\frac{2 J_0}{\\rho_0 k m(z) U(z)^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 J_0 m(z)}{\\rho_0 k U(z)^2}} $$\nThe wave is considered to break at level $z_i$ if $S(z_i) \\ge 1$.\n\n**6. Algorithmic Procedure**\n\nThe algorithm for computing the vertical profile of momentum deposition is as follows.\nFor each atmospheric profile case:\n1. Initialize a total deposition array, $D[z_i]$, to zeros for all grid levels $z_i$.\n2. For each spectral component $(k, h_0)$:\n   a. Calculate background state $U_0=U(0)$, $N_0=N(0)$.\n   b. Calculate the surface vertical wavenumber squared: $m_0^2 = N_0^2/U_0^2 - k^2$.\n   c. If $m_0^2 \\le 0$, the wave is evanescent at the source. The momentum flux $J_0$ is zero. Proceed to the next component.\n   d. Otherwise, calculate the magnitude of the upward momentum flux at the surface: $J_0 = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho_0 k m_0 U_0^2 h_0^2$.\n   e. Propagate this flux vertically. Iterate from level $i=1$ to the top level ($z_i = 1000, 2000, ..., 10000$ m).\n      i. At level $z_i$, calculate $U_i=U(z_i)$ and $N_i=N(z_i)$.\n      ii. **Critical Level Check:** If $|U_i| < U_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, the wave is absorbed. Add $J_0$ to the deposition at this level, $D[z_i] += J_0$, and terminate propagation for this component (break the vertical loop).\n      iii. **Turning Level Check:** Calculate $m_i^2 = N_i^2/U_i^2 - k^2$. If $m_i^2 \\le 0$, the wave is reflected/trapped. The upward flux is terminated. Add $J_0$ to $D[z_i]$ and break the loop.\n      iv. **Saturation Check:** If the wave is still propagating, calculate the saturation parameter $S_i^2 = \\frac{2 J_0 m_i}{\\rho_0 k U_i^2}$, where $m_i=\\sqrt{m_i^2}$. If $S_i^2 \\ge 1$, the wave breaks. Add $J_0$ to $D[z_i]$ and break the loop.\n   f. If the loop completes without breaking, the wave's momentum flux escapes the top of the model domain and is not deposited.\n3. The final array $D$ represents the total momentum deposition profile for the case.\nThis procedure is repeated for all test cases.",
