            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a characteristic horizontal wind speed scale, $U$, for a midlatitude synoptic-scale flow by considering the fundamental force balance and using dimensional analysis. We are given the following information:\n1. The flow is on the $500\\,\\mathrm{hPa}$ isobaric surface.\n2. The motion is steady, large-scale, and friction is negligible.\n3. The leading-order horizontal momentum balance is between the Coriolis acceleration and the pressure-gradient force. This set of assumptions defines the geostrophic balance.\n4. Over a horizontal meridional distance of $L = 500\\,\\mathrm{km}$, the geopotential height $Z$ decreases by $\\Delta Z = 50\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n5. The Coriolis parameter is $f = 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n6. The flow is in hydrostatic equilibrium, which is implicit in the use of geopotential height on an isobaric surface to represent the pressure gradient.\n\nThe horizontal momentum equations for a steady, frictionless flow on a rotating planet are the geostrophic balance equations. On a constant pressure (isobaric) surface, the pressure-gradient force (PGF) per unit mass is expressed in terms of the gradient of the geopotential $\\Phi = gZ$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity and $Z$ is the geopotential height. The PGF per unit mass is $-\\nabla_p \\Phi = -g \\nabla_p Z$, where $\\nabla_p$ is the horizontal gradient operator on the isobaric surface.\n\nThe geostrophic balance equations are:\n$$ -f v_g = -g \\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial x} $$\n$$ f u_g = -g \\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial y} $$\nwhere $u_g$ and $v_g$ are the zonal (east-west) and meridional (north-south) components of the geostrophic wind vector $\\vec{v}_g$, respectively.\n\nThe problem asks for a characteristic scale for the horizontal wind speed magnitude, which we denote as $U$. We can obtain this scale by performing a scaling analysis on the geostrophic balance equations. Let's consider the scales of the terms in the second equation, $f u_g = -g \\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial y}$.\n\nThe characteristic scale for the wind speed $u_g$ is $U$.\nThe Coriolis parameter $f$ is given as a scale.\nThe characteristic scale of the Coriolis term, $f u_g$, is therefore $fU$.\n\nThe characteristic scale for the horizontal derivative $\\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial y}$ is given by the change in geopotential height $\\Delta Z$ over the horizontal length scale $L$. Thus, the scale of the geopotential height gradient is $\\frac{\\Delta Z}{L}$.\nThe term $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, a constant.\nThe characteristic scale of the pressure-gradient force term, $-g \\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial y}$, is therefore $g \\frac{\\Delta Z}{L}$.\n\nSince the two forces are in balance, their characteristic scales must be of the same order of magnitude:\n$$ fU \\sim g \\frac{\\Delta Z}{L} $$\n\nFrom this scaling relationship, we can derive the expression for the characteristic wind speed scale $U$:\n$$ U = \\frac{g}{f} \\frac{\\Delta Z}{L} $$\nThis expression provides the characteristic magnitude of the geostrophic wind based on the given parameters.\n\nWe can now substitute the given numerical values to estimate $U$.\nThe provided values are:\n- $L = 500\\,\\mathrm{km} = 500 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{m} = 5 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $\\Delta Z = 50\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $f = 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity, $g$, is not explicitly given, but it is a fundamental constant required for relating geopotential height to the pressure gradient. We will use the standard value $g \\approx 9.8\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived scaling law:\n$$ U = \\frac{9.8\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}}{10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}} \\frac{50\\,\\mathrm{m}}{5 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{m}} $$\nFirst, let us calculate the ratio of the spatial scales:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta Z}{L} = \\frac{50\\,\\mathrm{m}}{5 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{5 \\times 10^1}{5 \\times 10^5} = 10^{-4} $$\nThis ratio is dimensionless.\n\nNow, substitute this back into the expression for $U$:\n$$ U = \\frac{9.8\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}}{10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}} \\times 10^{-4} $$\n$$ U = 9.8\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}} $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to two significant figures.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a dimensionless parameter from the horizontal momentum equations for synoptic-scale flow and its numerical evaluation.\n\nThe horizontal momentum equations for a fluid on a rotating planet, neglecting friction and in the Boussinesq approximation, can be written in vector form as:\n$$ \\frac{D\\mathbf{u}}{Dt} = -f\\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{u} - \\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\nabla_h p $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{u}$ is the horizontal velocity vector, $t$ is time, $\\frac{D}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla_h$ is the material derivative, $f$ is the Coriolis parameter, $\\mathbf{k}$ is the local vertical unit vector, $\\rho_0$ is a constant reference density, and $\\nabla_h p$ is the horizontal pressure gradient.\n\nThe term on the left, $\\frac{D\\mathbf{u}}{Dt}$, represents the inertial acceleration of a fluid parcel relative to the rotating frame of reference. The first term on the right, $-f\\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{u}$, is the Coriolis acceleration. The problem asks for the ratio of the inertial acceleration to the Coriolis acceleration. We can determine the characteristic magnitude of these two terms through scale analysis.\n\nLet $U$ be the characteristic horizontal velocity scale and $L$ be the characteristic horizontal length scale. The variables can be scaled as follows:\n- Horizontal velocity: a component like $u$ or $v$ scales as $U$. So, $|\\mathbf{u}| \\sim U$.\n- Horizontal gradients: $\\nabla_h$ scales as $1/L$.\n- The material derivative contains two parts: the local time derivative $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ and the advective derivative $\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla_h$. For synoptic-scale systems, the characteristic advective time scale is $T \\sim L/U$. Thus, the local time derivative scales as $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\sim \\frac{1}{T} = \\frac{U}{L}$.\n\nLet us now find the magnitude of the inertial and Coriolis acceleration terms.\n\n1.  **Inertial Acceleration**: The inertial acceleration is given by the material derivative, $\\frac{D\\mathbf{u}}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla_h)\\mathbf{u}$.\n    The magnitude of the local time derivative term is:\n    $$ \\left| \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} \\right| \\sim \\frac{U}{T} = \\frac{U}{L/U} = \\frac{U^2}{L} $$\n    The magnitude of the advective derivative term is:\n    $$ \\left| (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla_h)\\mathbf{u} \\right| \\sim (U \\cdot \\frac{1}{L}) U = \\frac{U^2}{L} $$\n    Since both components of the inertial acceleration have the same characteristic magnitude, the overall magnitude of the inertial acceleration is:\n    $$ \\left| \\frac{D\\mathbf{u}}{Dt} \\right| \\sim \\frac{U^2}{L} $$\n    This term encompasses both advective effects and centripetal acceleration due to the curvature of the flow path.\n\n2.  **Coriolis Acceleration**: The Coriolis acceleration is given by $-f\\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{u}$. Its magnitude is:\n    $$ |-f\\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{u}| = |f| |\\mathbf{u}| \\sin(\\theta) $$\n    where $\\theta$ is the angle between $\\mathbf{k}$ and $\\mathbf{u}$.

The numerical conclusion is correct: with $S$ much larger than $f^{2} r / 4$, there is no gradient-wind solution. Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. This option proposes $\\left| (1/\\rho)\\,\\partial p/\\partial r \\right| \\le fv$ as the criterion, which is not the discriminant condition for the quadratic and is dimensionally inconsistent unless $v$ is treated as an unknown within the criterion. It also asserts that arbitrarily large $|v|$ can always yield balance, which is false for highs because increasing $|v|$ increases outward centrifugal $v^2/r$ quadratically and inward Coriolis $fv$ linearly, yielding a finite maximum inward net of $-f^2r/4$. The suggested $|v| = \\sqrt{rS}$ corresponds to equating $v^2/r$ to $S$, which neglects Coriolis and does not satisfy the signed balance for a high. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nC. This option reverses the inequality for highs, claiming $- (1/\\rho)\\,\\partial p/\\partial r \\ge f^{2} r / 4$. The direction of the inequality is wrong; stronger highs at lower latitudes are harder (not easier) to balance because $f$ is smaller. The numerical conclusion is therefore wrong. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. This option claims there is always at least one real root because $v^2/r \\ge 0$, which ignores the discriminant condition; for highs with $S > f^2r/4$, there are no real roots at all. It further claims negative roots are unphysical, which is incorrect: negative $v$ is the physically appropriate anticyclonic direction in the NH, and the speed magnitude $|v|$ is positive. The appeal to a “cyclostrophic solution” in this context is also misplaced because cyclostrophic balance would require neglecting Coriolis, whereas the impossibility here stems from the combined quadratic-plus-linear structure of $v^{2}/r + f v$. Verdict: Incorrect.",
