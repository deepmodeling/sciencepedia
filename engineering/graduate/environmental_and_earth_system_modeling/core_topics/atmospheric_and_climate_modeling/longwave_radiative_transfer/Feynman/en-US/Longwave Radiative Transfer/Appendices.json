            "problem": "Consider longwave radiative transfer from an idealized terrestrial emitter modeled as a blackbody. The spectral radiance per unit wavelength, denoted by $B_{\\lambda}(T)$, is governed by the fundamental Planck law of blackbody radiation. Treat the emitter as a perfect blackbody at temperature $T$ and assume the International System of Units (SI) throughout. \n\nStarting from the Planck law for spectral radiance per unit wavelength, derive the necessary condition for a maximum of $B_{\\lambda}(T)$ with respect to the wavelength $\\lambda$ at fixed $T$. Express this condition in terms of a dimensionless variable $x$ built from fundamental constants.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of blackbody radiation, well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient data, and expressed in objective, formal language. The problem is a standard derivation and application of Wien's displacement law from Planck's law of radiation.\n\nThe starting point is the Planck law for the spectral radiance of a blackbody per unit wavelength, $B_{\\lambda}(T)$, given by:\n$$\nB_{\\lambda}(T) = \\frac{2hc^2}{\\lambda^5} \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{hc}{\\lambda k_B T}\\right) - 1}\n$$\nwhere $h$ is the Planck constant, $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature of the blackbody, and $\\lambda$ is the wavelength.\n\nTo find the wavelength $\\lambda_{\\max}$ at which $B_{\\lambda}(T)$ is a maximum for a fixed temperature $T$, we must find the root of the derivative of $B_{\\lambda}(T)$ with respect to $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\frac{d B_{\\lambda}(T)}{d \\lambda} = 0\n$$\nFor convenience, let the constant terms be $C_1 = 2hc^2$ and the exponent term be $A = \\frac{hc}{k_B T}$. The expression becomes $B_{\\lambda}(T) = C_1 \\lambda^{-5} (\\exp(A/\\lambda) - 1)^{-1}$.\nTaking the derivative with respect to $\\lambda$ using the product and chain rules:\n$$\n\\frac{d B_{\\lambda}}{d \\lambda} = C_1 \\left[ (-5\\lambda^{-6})(\\exp(A/\\lambda) - 1)^{-1} + \\lambda^{-5}(-1)(\\exp(A/\\lambda) - 1)^{-2} \\cdot \\exp(A/\\lambda) \\cdot (-A\\lambda^{-2}) \\right] = 0\n$$\nDividing by the non-zero common factor $C_1 \\lambda^{-6} (\\exp(A/\\lambda)-1)^{-1}$:\n$$\n-5 + \\lambda^{-1}(\\exp(A/\\lambda) - 1)^{-1} \\cdot \\exp(A/\\lambda) \\cdot A = 0\n$$\n$$\n5 = \\frac{A}{\\lambda} \\frac{\\exp(A/\\lambda)}{\\exp(A/\\lambda) - 1}\n$$\nMultiplying both sides by $1 - \\exp(-A/\\lambda)$:\n$$\n5(1 - \\exp(-A/\\lambda)) = \\frac{A}{\\lambda}\n$$\nThe problem specifies introducing a dimensionless variable $x$. The term $A/\\lambda$ is already dimensionless. Let us define $x$ as:\n$$\nx = \\frac{A}{\\lambda} = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda k_B T}\n$$\nSubstituting $x$ into the condition for the maximum yields the required transcendental equation:\n$$\nx = 5(1 - \\exp(-x))\n$$\nThis can be rearranged to $x + 5\\exp(-x) - 5 = 0$. The non-zero solution to this equation, which we denote as $x^{\\star}$, is a mathematical constant.\n\nThe wavelength of maximum emission, $\\lambda_{\\max}$, is the specific value of $\\lambda$ that satisfies this condition. Therefore, at the maximum, the value of $x$ is $x^{\\star}$:\n$$\nx^{\\star} = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda_{\\max} k_B T}\n$$\nRearranging this equation gives the analytic form of the wavelength of maximum emission, which is Wien's displacement law:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\max} T = \\frac{hc}{x^{\\star} k_B}\n$$\nThe Wien displacement constant, $b$, is defined as this constant product:\n$$\nb = \\lambda_{\\max} T = \\frac{hc}{x^{\\star} k_B}\n$$\nThus, the analytic form for $\\lambda_{\\max}$ as a function of $T$ is $\\lambda_{\\max} = b/T$.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $\\lambda_{\\max}$ for the terrestrial temperature $T=289.3~\\text{K}$.\nFirst, we need the numerical value of $x^{\\star}$ by solving $x = 5(1 - \\exp(-x))$. Numerical methods yield:\n$$\nx^{\\star} \\approx 4.965114231744276\n$$\nUsing the provided exact values for the fundamental constants:\n$h = 6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}~\\text{J}\\,\\text{s}$\n$c = 2.99792458 \\times 10^{8}~\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n$k_{B} = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}~\\text{J}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$\n\nWe can now calculate the Wien displacement constant $b$:\n$$\nb = \\frac{hc}{x^{\\star} k_B} = \\frac{(6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}) \\times (2.99792458 \\times 10^{8})}{(4.965114231744276) \\times (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23})} \\approx 0.002897771955~\\text{m}\\,\\text{K}\n$$\nNow, we can find $\\lambda_{\\max}$ for $T = 289.3~\\text{K}$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\max} = \\frac{b}{T} = \\frac{0.002897771955~\\text{m}\\,\\text{K}}{289.3~\\text{K}} \\approx 1.00165017 \\times 10^{-5}~\\text{m}\n$$\nTo express this in micrometers, we multiply by $10^6$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\max} \\approx 10.0165017~\\mu\\text{m}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $10.02~\\mu\\text{m}$.\n\nFinally, we verify the consistency of this result. The extremum condition is $x=5(1-\\exp(-x))$, where $x$ is defined as $x = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda k_B T}$. The derived expression for the specific wavelength that satisfies this condition is $\\lambda_{\\max} = \\frac{hc}{x^{\\star} k_B T}$. To verify consistency, we substitute this expression for $\\lambda_{\\max}$ back into the definition of $x$:\n$$\nx_{\\text{verify}} = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda_{\\max} k_B T} = \\frac{hc}{\\left(\\frac{hc}{x^{\\star} k_B T}\\right) k_B T}\n$$\nThe terms in the denominator simplify:\n$$\nx_{\\text{verify}} = \\frac{hc}{\\frac{hc \\cdot k_B T}{x^{\\star} k_B T}} = \\frac{hc}{\\frac{hc}{x^{\\star}}} = hc \\cdot \\frac{x^{\\star}}{hc} = x^{\\star}\n$$\nThis shows that the value of the dimensionless variable $x$ calculated at the wavelength $\\lambda_{\\max}$ is precisely $x^{\\star}$. Since $x^{\\star}$ is defined as the solution to the extremum condition $x = 5(1 - \\exp(-x))$, this algebraic identity confirms that our derived $\\lambda_{\\max}$ is indeed the wavelength that maximizes Planck's function $B_{\\lambda}(T)$, thus verifying the consistency of the entire procedure.\n\nThe final numerical answer for $\\lambda_{\\max}$, rounded to four significant figures, is $10.02~\\mu\\text{m}$.",

This is a common notational convention where the downwelling stream is described using positive $\\mu$ as a convenient angular variable, representing $\\mu = |\\cos(\\theta)|$.

For an upward-propagating beam ($\\mu  0$), integrating the RTE from a depth $\\tau'$ to a shallower depth $\\tau$ yields:\n$$\nI(\\tau, \\mu) = I(\\tau', \\mu) e^{-(\\tau' - \\tau)/\\mu} + \\int_{\\tau}^{\\tau'} S(t) e^{-(t - \\tau)/\\mu} \\frac{dt}{\\mu}\n$$\nApplying this over the entire atmospheric column from the surface ($\\tau' = \\tau_{\\max}$) to the TOA ($\\tau=0$) and substituting the surface boundary condition $I(\\tau_{\\max},\\mu) = S(\\tau_{\\max})$, we obtain the upward intensity at the TOA:\n$$\nI(0, \\mu) = S(\\tau_{\\max}) e^{-\\tau_{\\max}/\\mu} + \\int_0^{\\tau_{\\max}} S(t) e^{-t/\\mu} \\frac{dt}{\\mu}\n$$\nThe upward flux at the TOA is defined as the integral of the vertical component of intensity over the upward hemisphere:\n$$\nF^{\\uparrow}(0) = 2\\pi \\int_0^1 \\mu I(0, \\mu) d\\mu\n$$\nThe reference flux, $F^{\\uparrow}_{\\mathrm{ref}}(0)$, is computed by evaluating these integrals using high-order Gauss-Legendre quadrature. For each discrete angle $\\mu_k$ from a set of $M_{\\mathrm{ref}}=16$ nodes, the integral in the expression for $I(0, \\mu_k)$ is evaluated using an $N_{\\tau,\\mathrm{ref}}=200$ point Gauss-Legendre quadrature over the optical depth range $[0, \\tau_{\\max}]$. The resulting intensities $I_{\\mathrm{ref}}(0, \\mu_k)$ are then integrated over $\\mu \\in [0, 1]$ using the $M_{\\mathrm{ref}}=16$ point quadrature to obtain the final reference flux.\n\n**2. Numerical Scheme for Discretized Layers**\n\nThe numerical solution is constructed by discretizing the atmosphere into $N$ layers of uniform optical thickness $\\Delta\\tau = \\tau_{\\max}/N$. The optical depth levels are $\\tau_j = j \\Delta\\tau$ for $j=0, 1, \\dots, N$.\n\nWithin a single layer between $\\tau_{j-1}$ and $\\tau_j$, we assume the source function $S(\\tau)$ can be approximated by a constant value $S_j$. A scientifically justified choice that ensures second-order accuracy for the layer emission is the value of the source function at the layer's midpoint, $\\tau_{j-1/2} = (\\tau_j + \\tau_{j-1})/2$:\n$$\nS_j \\approx S(\\tau_{j-1/2})\n$$\nWith $S(\\tau)$ constant within the layer, the RTE can be solved analytically. Integrating from $\\tau_j$ up to $\\tau_{j-1}$ gives the relation between the intensities at the top and bottom of the layer:\n$$\nI(\\tau_{j-1}, \\mu) = I(\\tau_j, \\mu) e^{-\\Delta\\tau/\\mu} + S_j (1 - e^{-\\Delta\\tau/\\mu})\n$$\nThis equation acts as a \"propagator,\" relating the intensity from one level to the next. The numerical algorithm proceeds as follows:\n- For each discrete upward direction $\\mu_k$ (from an $M$-point Gauss-Legendre quadrature on $[0,1]$):\n    1. Initialize the intensity at the surface (level $j=N$) using the boundary condition: $I_N(\\mu_k) = I(\\tau_{\\max}, \\mu_k) = S(\\tau_{\\max})$.\n    2. March upward from $j=N$ to $j=1$:\n       $$ I_{j-1}(\\mu_k) = I_j(\\mu_k) e^{-\\Delta\\tau/\\mu_k} + S(\\tau_{j-1/2}) (1 - e^{-\\Delta\\tau/\\mu_k}) $$\n    3. The loop terminates when $I_0(\\mu_k) = I(0, \\mu_k)$ is found.\nOnce the TOA intensities $I(0, \\mu_k)$ are computed for all discrete angles, the numerical upward flux is approximated using the corresponding discrete ordinate sum:\n$$\nF^{\\uparrow}_{\\mathrm{num}}(0) = 2\\pi \\sum_{k=1}^M w_k \\mu_k I(0, \\mu_k)\n$$\nwhere $w_k$ are the Gauss-Legendre weights.\n\n**3. Stability Analysis**\n\nThe stability of the scheme is assessed by verifying that the computed intensities remain physically plausible, i.e., non-negative and bounded by the maximum possible source function value. Let $S_{\\max} = \\max_{\\tau \\in [0, \\tau_{\\max}]} S(\\tau)$. Since the temperature profile $T(\\tau)$ is monotonically increasing with $\\tau$, the maximum source function occurs at the surface: $S_{\\max} = S(\\tau_{\\max})$.\n\nThe propagator equation can be written as:\n$$\nI_{j-1} = \\mathcal{T} I_j + (1 - \\mathcal{T}) S_j, \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\mathcal{T} = e^{-\\Delta\\tau/\\mu}\n$$\nSince $\\Delta\\tau  0$ and $\\mu  0$, the transmissivity $\\mathcal{T}$ is always in the range $(0, 1)$. The equation for $I_{j-1}$ is therefore a convex combination of $I_j$ and the layer source function $S_j$.\n- **Non-negativity**: The boundary condition at the surface is $I_N = S(\\tau_{\\max}) \\ge 0$. The source function $S(\\tau) = (T(\\tau)/T_{\\mathrm{ref}})^4$ is non-negative everywhere. Since $I_{j-1}$ is a sum of non-negative terms, if $I_j \\ge 0$, then $I_{j-1} \\ge 0$. By induction, all intensities $I_j$ will be non-negative.\n- **Upper Bound**: The scheme starts with $I_N = S(\\tau_{\\max}) = S_{\\max}$. For the next step, $I_{N-1} = \\mathcal{T} I_N + (1-\\mathcal{T}) S_N$. Since $S_N = S(\\tau_{N-1/2}) \\le S_{\\max}$, we have $I_{N-1} \\le \\mathcal{T} S_{\\max} + (1-\\mathcal{T}) S_{\\max} = S_{\\max}$. By induction, if $I_j \\le S_{\\max}$, then $I_{j-1} \\le S_{\\max}$.\n\nThus, the numerical scheme is inherently stable and guarantees that all computed intensities will lie in the interval $[0, S_{\\max}]$. The stability diagnostic flag will therefore be `True` for all test cases, barring any significant floating-point precision errors, for which a small tolerance is used in the implementation.\n\nThe relative error $\\varepsilon$ is then computed for each test case as specified:\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\left| \\frac{F^{\\uparrow}_{\\mathrm{num}}(0) - F^{\\uparrow}_{\\mathrm{ref}}(0)}{F^{\\uparrow}_{\\mathrm{ref}}(0)} \\right|\n$$\nThe implementation will follow this derived methodology to produce the required results.",
