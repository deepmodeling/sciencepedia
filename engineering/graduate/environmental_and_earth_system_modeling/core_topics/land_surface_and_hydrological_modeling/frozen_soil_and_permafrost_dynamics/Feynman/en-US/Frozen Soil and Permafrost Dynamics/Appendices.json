            "problem": "A semi-infinite, laterally uniform soil column overlain by tundra undergoes seasonal thaw from the ground surface downward during the warm season. The soil is initially isothermal at the phase-change temperature, so that the phase boundary (thaw front) is approximated by the isotherm at $0^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$. Assume one-dimensional (1D) conduction, negligible advection, constant thermal conductivity in the thawed layer, and that the latent heat consumed at the thaw front dominates over sensible heat storage in the thawed layer.

The physics of heat conduction (Fourier's law) and latent heat consumption are fundamental principles. The application to permafrost thaw is a standard topic in geophysics and environmental science. All assumptions, while simplifications, are common in introductory treatments of the subject to achieve an analytical solution. The provided numerical values are physically realistic for thawing, ice-rich soil.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. The assumptions, particularly that of negligible sensible heat storage, lead to a straightforward ordinary differential equation that can be solved to find a unique solution for the active layer thickness. All necessary data for both the derivation and the final calculation are provided.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language. Terms like \"active layer thickness\" and \"thawing degree-days\" are either standard in the field or explicitly defined.\n4.  **No Other Flaws**: The problem is self-contained, consistent, and does not suffer from any of the other invalidity criteria. The setup is a valid and common idealization used in permafrost modeling.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the ALT Expression\nThe core of the problem lies in the energy balance at the moving thaw front, located at depth $z(t)$. The downward heat flux from the surface, $q(t)$, conducted through the thawed layer must equal the rate at which energy is consumed by melting ice as the front advances.\n\nThe energy required to melt the ice in a thin layer of soil of thickness $dz$ and unit area is determined by the volumetric latent heat of fusion of the soil, $L_v$. This is the energy needed to melt the ice contained within a unit volume of soil. Given the volumetric ice fraction $\\theta_i$, the mass of ice per unit volume of soil is $\\rho_i \\theta_i$. Therefore, the volumetric latent heat is:\n$$L_v = \\rho_i L \\theta_i$$\nThe rate of energy consumption per unit area as the front advances at a speed $dz/dt$ is $L_v \\frac{dz}{dt}$.\n\nAccording to Fourier's law of heat conduction, the heat flux at the thaw front is given by:\n$$q(t) = -k \\left. \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z'} \\right|_{z'=z(t)}$$\nwhere $z'$ is the depth coordinate, $T$ is the temperature, and $k$ is the thermal conductivity of the thawed layer.\n\nThe energy balance equation at the moving boundary $z(t)$ is thus:\n$$-k \\left. \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z'} \\right|_{z'=z(t)} = L_v \\frac{dz}{dt} = \\rho_i L \\theta_i \\frac{dz}{dt}$$\n\nThe problem states to neglect sensible heat storage in the thawed layer. This key simplification implies a quasi-steady-state temperature profile in the thawed zone ($0 \\le z' \\le z(t)$) at any instant $t$. This means the temperature profile is linear. The boundary conditions for the temperature in the thawed layer are:\n1. $T(z'=0, t) = T_s(t)$ (at the surface)\n2. $T(z'=z(t), t) = T_m = 0^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ (at the thaw front)\n\nFor a linear profile, $T(z', t) = A(t) z' + B(t)$. Applying the boundary conditions:\n- $B(t) = T_s(t)$\n- $A(t) z(t) + T_s(t) = 0 \\implies A(t) = -\\frac{T_s(t)}{z(t)}$\n\nThe temperature profile is $T(z', t) = T_s(t) \\left(1 - \\frac{z'}{z(t)}\\right)$. The temperature gradient is constant throughout the thawed layer at any time $t$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z'} = -\\frac{T_s(t)}{z(t)}$$\nSubstituting this gradient into the energy balance equation:\n$$-k \\left( -\\frac{T_s(t)}{z(t)} \\right) = \\rho_i L \\theta_i \\frac{dz}{dt}$$\n$$\\frac{k T_s(t)}{z(t)} = \\rho_i L \\theta_i \\frac{dz}{dt}$$\nThis is a separable ordinary differential equation. We rearrange the terms to separate the variables $z$ and $t$. Thawing occurs only when $T_s(t) > 0$. We can thus replace $T_s(t)$ with $\\max(0, T_s(t))$.\n$$z(t) \\, dz = \\frac{k}{\\rho_i L \\theta_i} \\max(0, T_s(t)) \\, dt$$\nWe integrate this equation over the entire thaw season, from $t=0$ to $t=t_f$. The thaw depth evolves from $z(0)=0$ to $z(t_f) = z_{\\mathrm{ALT}}$.\n$$\\int_{0}^{z_{\\mathrm{ALT}}} z \\, dz = \\int_{0}^{t_f} \\frac{k}{\\rho_i L \\theta_i} \\max(0, T_s(t)) \\, dt$$\n$$\\left[ \\frac{z^2}{2} \\right]_{0}^{z_{\\mathrm{ALT}}} = \\frac{k}{\\rho_i L \\theta_i} \\int_{0}^{t_f} \\max(0, T_s(t)) \\, dt$$\n$$\\frac{z_{\\mathrm{ALT}}^2}{2} = \\frac{k}{\\rho_i L \\theta_i} \\int_{0}^{t_f} \\max(0, T_s(t)) \\, dt$$\nSolving for $z_{\\mathrm{ALT}}$, we obtain the general expression:\n$$z_{\\mathrm{ALT}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2k}{\\rho_i L \\theta_i} \\int_{0}^{t_f} \\max(0, T_s(t)) \\, dt}$$\n\n### Casting into a Practical Estimator using TDD\nThe problem defines the thawing degree-days, $F_{\\mathrm{TDD}}$, as the time integral of the positive part of the surface temperature, with units of $\\mathrm{K \\cdot day}$.\n$$F_{\\mathrm{TDD}} = \\int_{0}^{t_f} \\max(0, T_s(t)) \\, dt \\quad [\\text{in units of } \\mathrm{K \\cdot day}]$$\nThe integral in our derived expression, let's call it $I_{\\mathrm{SI}}$, must be in SI units of $\\mathrm{K \\cdot s}$ for dimensional consistency.\n$$I_{\\mathrm{SI}} = \\int_{0}^{t_f} \\max(0, T_s(t)) \\, dt \\quad [\\text{in units of } \\mathrm{K \\cdot s}]$$\nTo use the given $F_{\\mathrm{TDD}}$, we must convert it from $\\mathrm{K \\cdot day}$ to $\\mathrm{K \\cdot s}$. The conversion factor is the number of seconds in a day:\n$$1\\,\\mathrm{day} = 24\\,\\mathrm{h/day} \\times 60\\,\\mathrm{min/h} \\times 60\\,\\mathrm{s/min} = 86400\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nThus, the relationship is:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{SI}} = F_{\\mathrm{TDD}} \\times 86400\\,\\mathrm{s/day}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $z_{\\mathrm{ALT}}$ gives the practical estimator:\n$$z_{\\mathrm{ALT}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2k F_{\\mathrm{TDD}} \\times 86400}{\\rho_i L \\theta_i}}$$\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nWe now compute $z_{\\mathrm{ALT}}$ using the provided numerical values:\n- $k = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n- $\\rho_{i} = 917\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$\n- $L = 3.34 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}}$\n- $\\theta_{i} = 0.50$\n- $F_{\\mathrm{TDD}} = 650\\,\\mathrm{K \\cdot day}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the volumetric latent heat of fusion for the soil, $L_v$:\n$$L_v = \\rho_i L \\theta_i = (917\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}) \\times (3.34 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}}) \\times 0.50$$\n$$L_v = 1.531295 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-3}}$$\n\nNext, we convert thawing degree-days to SI units:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{SI}} = F_{\\mathrm{TDD}} \\times 86400 = 650\\,\\mathrm{K \\cdot day} \\times 86400\\,\\mathrm{s/day} = 5.616 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{K \\cdot s}$$\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the estimator for $z_{\\mathrm{ALT}}$:\n$$z_{\\mathrm{ALT}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times (1.2\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (5.616 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{K \\cdot s})}{1.531295 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-3}}}}$$\nNoting that $1\\,\\mathrm{W} = 1\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s^{-1}}$, the numerator simplifies to:\n$$2 \\times 1.2 \\times 5.616 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-1}} = 1.34784 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-1}}$$\nSo,\n$$z_{\\mathrm{ALT}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1.34784 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-1}}}{1.531295 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-3}}}}$$\n$$z_{\\mathrm{ALT}} = \\sqrt{0.880199... \\ \\mathrm{m^2}}$$\n$$z_{\\mathrm{ALT}} = 0.938189... \\ \\mathrm{m}$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, as requested:\n$$z_{\\mathrm{ALT}} \\approx 0.938 \\ \\mathrm{m}$$",

The physical model is based on established principles of fluid flow in porous media (Darcy's law and mass conservation) combined with a plausible constitutive model for the effect of ice on hydraulic conductivity. The parameters provided are physically consistent; specifically, the volumetric ice content $\\theta_i(z) = \\theta_{i0} + \\alpha z$ varies from $\\theta_i(0) = 0.10$ to $\\theta_i(L) = 0.30$, which is always less than the porosity $\\theta_p = 0.50$, ensuring that the hydraulic conductivity remains positive throughout the column. The problem is valid and can be solved through direct integration.\n\nThe fundamental principles governing the system are mass conservation and Darcy's law. For a steady, one-dimensional flow in a saturated medium with no internal sources or sinks, the mass conservation equation simplifies to the statement that the Darcy flux, $q$, is constant with respect to the spatial coordinate $z$:\n$$\n\\frac{dq}{dz} = 0 \\implies q = \\text{constant}\n$$\nDarcy's law provides the relationship between the flux $q$, the hydraulic head gradient $\\frac{dh}{dz}$, and the hydraulic conductivity $K(z)$:\n$$\nq = -K(z)\\frac{dh}{dz}\n$$\nThe problem specifies a sign convention where downward flow (in the direction of increasing $z$) is positive.

Consequently, the flux $q$ must be positive, which is consistent with the convention for downward flow.\n\nTo find the constant flux $q$, we first rearrange Darcy's law and integrate over the depth of the soil column from $z=0$ to $z=L$:\n$$\ndh = -\\frac{q}{K(z)}dz\n$$\nIntegrating both sides with their respective boundary conditions:\n$$\n\\int_{h(0)}^{h(L)} dh = \\int_{0}^{L} -\\frac{q}{K(z)}dz\n$$\nSince $q$ is a constant, it can be moved outside the integral:\n$$\nh(L) - h(0) = -q \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{1}{K(z)}dz\n$$\nSubstituting the boundary values $h(0)=h_0$ and $h(L)=h_L$, and solving for $q$ yields:\n$$\nq = \\frac{h_0 - h_L}{\\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{dz}{K(z)}}\n$$\nThe integral in the denominator represents the total hydraulic resistance of the column.

It presents a standard problem in computational heat transfer for phase-change materials, specifically frozen soil. The governing equation is a valid representation of energy conservation using the enthalpy method. The Apparent Heat Capacity (AHC) formulation is a standard technique derived from the enthalpy method. The expression for volumetric enthalpy is a physically reasonable mixture model, and the use of a smoothed `tanh` function to regularize the phase change is a common and valid numerical practice. A forward-time, centered-space (FTCS) discretization of the resulting diffusion-type equation has a well-known stability criterion. All necessary parameters are provided and are dimensionally consistent. The problem is not ill-posed, ambiguous, or based on faulty science.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Maximum Stable Time Step\n\nThe governing equation in the Apparent Heat Capacity (AHC) formulation is given as:\n$$\nC_{app}(T) \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\cdot (k \\nabla T)\n$$\nIn one spatial dimension, this becomes:\n$$\nC_{app}(T) \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\\right)\n$$\nSince the thermal conductivity $k$ is constant, we can rewrite this as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\frac{k}{C_{app}(T)} \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nThis is a one-dimensional diffusion equation with a temperature-dependent thermal diffusivity $\\alpha(T) = \\frac{k}{C_{app}(T)}$. The FTCS (Forward-Time, Centered-Space) explicit scheme for this equation is stable if the following condition is met:\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha(T) \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\le \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\alpha(T) = \\frac{k}{C_{app}(T)}$, the stability criterion becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{k}{C_{app}(T)} \\frac{\\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\le \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThe maximum stable time step, $\\Delta t_{\\max}$, is therefore a function of temperature $T$:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max}(T) = \\frac{C_{app}(T) (\\Delta x)^2}{2k}\n$$\nTo find $\\Delta t_{\\max}(T)$, we must first derive the expression for the apparent heat capacity, $C_{app}(T) = \\frac{dH}{dT}$, by differentiating the given volumetric enthalpy $H(T)$ with respect to temperature $T$.\n\nThe volumetric enthalpy is:\n$$\nH(T) = (1-\\phi)\\,\\rho_{m}\\,c_{m}\\,T + \\phi\\left[\\theta_{l}(T)\\,\\rho_{w}\\,c_{w}\\,T + \\big(1-\\theta_{l}(T)\\big)\\,\\rho_{i}\\,c_{i}\\,T\\right] + \\phi\\,\\rho_{w}\\,L\\,\\theta_{l}(T)\n$$\nWe differentiate $H(T)$ with respect to $T$ using the product and chain rules.
