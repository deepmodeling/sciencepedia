            "problem": "A tracer with concentration field $c(x,t)$ evolves in a one-dimensional, well-mixed channel of length $L$ with constant, uniform flow speed $u0$ in the positive $x$-direction, constant turbulent diffusivity $D0$, spatially uniform volumetric source $S_{0}0$ (with units of mass per volume per time), and first-order decay at rate $k0$.

            "solution": "### Step 1: Derivation of the Governing Equation\n\nWe begin with the principle of mass conservation for the tracer concentration $c(x,t)$ in a differential control volume of length $\\Delta x$ and cross-sectional area $A$. The rate of change of mass in the control volume is equal to the net flux into the volume plus the net rate of production within the volume.\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{x}^{x+\\Delta x} c(x',t) A \\,dx' = J(x,t)A - J(x+\\Delta x, t)A + \\int_{x}^{x+\\Delta x} (S_0 - kc(x',t)) A \\,dx'\n$$\nHere, $J(x,t)$ is the total flux of the tracer (mass per area per time). Dividing by $A\\Delta x$ and taking the limit as $\\Delta x \\to 0$, we obtain the one-dimensional conservation law in differential form:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x} + S_0 - kc\n$$\nThe total flux $J$ is the sum of the advective flux, $J_{adv} = uc$, and the diffusive flux, which is given by Fick's first law, $J_{diff} = -D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}$. Thus, the total flux is:\n$$\nJ = uc - D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $J$ into the conservation law gives the advection-diffusion-reaction equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(uc - D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\right) + S_0 - kc\n$$\nSince the flow speed $u$ and diffusivity $D$ are constant, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = -u \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} + D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2} + S_0 - kc\n$$\nThe problem asks for the steady-state solution, for which $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = 0$. This yields the governing steady-state ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $c(x)$:\n$$\nD \\frac{d^2 c}{dx^2} - u \\frac{d c}{dx} - kc + S_0 = 0\n$$\n\n### Step 2: Solution of the Ordinary Differential Equation\n\nThe equation is a second-order, linear, non-homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients. We can write it in the standard form:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 c}{dx^2} - \\frac{u}{D} \\frac{d c}{dx} - \\frac{k}{D} c = -\\frac{S_0}{D}\n$$\nThe general solution $c(x)$ is the sum of a particular solution $c_p(x)$ and the general solution to the homogeneous equation $c_h(x)$.\n\n**Particular Solution ($c_p$)**:\nSince the non-homogeneous term $-\\frac{S_0}{D}$ is a constant, we assume a constant particular solution $c_p(x) = C_p$. Substituting into the ODE:\n$$\n0 - 0 - \\frac{k}{D} C_p = -\\frac{S_0}{D} \\implies C_p = \\frac{S_0}{k}\n$$\nSo, the particular solution is $c_p(x) = \\frac{S_0}{k}$.\n\n**Homogeneous Solution ($c_h$)**:\nThe homogeneous equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 c_h}{dx^2} - \\frac{u}{D} \\frac{d c_h}{dx} - \\frac{k}{D} c_h = 0\n$$\nThe characteristic equation is $r^2 - \\frac{u}{D} r - \\frac{k}{D} = 0$. The roots $r_{1,2}$ are:\n$$\nr_{1,2} = \\frac{\\frac{u}{D} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{u}{D}\\right)^2 - 4(1)\\left(-\\frac{k}{D}\\right)}}{2} = \\frac{u}{2D} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{u}{2D}\\right)^2 + \\frac{k}{D}}\n$$\nTo simplify the expression and incorporate the decay-diffusion length scale $L_k = \\sqrt{D/k}$, we define two parameters:\n$$\np = \\frac{u}{2D} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad q = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{u}{2D}\\right)^2 + \\frac{k}{D}} = \\sqrt{p^2 + \\frac{1}{L_k^2}}\n$$\nThe roots are $r_1 = p+q$ and $r_2 = p-q$. The homogeneous solution can be written as:\n$$\nc_h(x) = C_1 e^{r_1 x} + C_2 e^{r_2 x} = e^{px} (C_1 e^{qx} + C_2 e^{-qx})\n$$\nAn equivalent and more convenient form uses hyperbolic functions:\n$$\nc_h(x) = e^{px} (A \\cosh(qx) + B \\sinh(qx))\n$$\n\n**General Solution**:\nThe general solution is $c(x) = c_h(x) + c_p(x)$:\n$$\nc(x) = e^{px} (A \\cosh(qx) + B \\sinh(qx)) + \\frac{S_0}{k}\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Application of Boundary Conditions\n\nThe coefficients $A$ and $B$ are determined by the boundary conditions $c(0) = 0$ and $c(L) = 0$.\n\n1.  At $x=0$:\n    $c(0) = e^{0} (A \\cosh(0) + B \\sinh(0)) + \\frac{S_0}{k} = 0$\n    $A \\cdot 1 + B \\cdot 0 + \\frac{S_0}{k} = 0 \\implies A = -\\frac{S_0}{k}$\n\n2.  At $x=L$:\n    $c(L) = e^{pL} (A \\cosh(qL) + B \\sinh(qL)) + \\frac{S_0}{k} = 0$\n    $e^{pL} \\left(-\\frac{S_0}{k} \\cosh(qL) + B \\sinh(qL)\\right) = -\\frac{S_0}{k}$\n    $-\\frac{S_0}{k} \\cosh(qL) + B \\sinh(qL) = -\\frac{S_0}{k} e^{-pL}$\n    $B \\sinh(qL) = \\frac{S_0}{k} \\cosh(qL) - \\frac{S_0}{k} e^{-pL}$\n    $B = \\frac{S_0}{k} \\frac{\\cosh(qL) - e^{-pL}}{\\sinh(qL)}$\n\n### Step 4: Final Expression for the Concentration Profile\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $A$ and $B$ back into the general solution:\n$$\nc(x) = e^{px} \\left(-\\frac{S_0}{k} \\cosh(qx) + \\frac{S_0}{k} \\frac{\\cosh(qL) - e^{-pL}}{\\sinh(qL)} \\sinh(qx)\\right) + \\frac{S_0}{k}\n$$\n$$\nc(x) = \\frac{S_0}{k} \\left[ 1 + e^{px} \\left(-\\cosh(qx) + \\frac{\\cosh(qL) - e^{-pL}}{\\sinh(qL)} \\sinh(qx)\\right) \\right]\n$$\nTo simplify, we find a common denominator $\\sinh(qL)$:\n$$\nc(x) = \\frac{S_0}{k} \\left[ 1 - \\frac{e^{px}}{\\sinh(qL)} \\left(\\sinh(qL)\\cosh(qx) - (\\cosh(qL) - e^{-pL})\\sinh(qx)\\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nc(x) = \\frac{S_0}{k} \\left[ 1 - \\frac{e^{px}}{\\sinh(qL)} \\left(\\sinh(qL)\\cosh(qx) - \\cosh(qL)\\sinh(qx) + e^{-pL}\\sinh(qx)\\right) \\right]\n$$\nUsing the hyperbolic identity $\\sinh(a-b) = \\sinh(a)\\cosh(b) - \\cosh(a)\\sinh(b)$, we have $\\sinh(qL-qx) = \\sinh(q(L-x))$.\n$$\nc(x) = \\frac{S_0}{k} \\left[ 1 - \\frac{e^{px}}{\\sinh(qL)} \\left(\\sinh(q(L-x)) + e^{-pL}\\sinh(qx)\\right) \\right]\n$$\nFinally, substituting back $p=u/(2D)$:\n$$\nc(x) = \\frac{S_0}{k} \\left[ 1 - \\frac{\\exp\\left(\\frac{ux}{2D}\\right)}{\\sinh(qL)} \\left( \\sinh(q(L-x)) + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{uL}{2D}\\right)\\sinh(qx) \\right) \\right]\n$$\nwhere $q = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{u}{2D}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{L_k^2}}$. This is the final steady-state concentration profile.\n\n### Interpretation of $L_k$\n\nThe decay-diffusion length scale $L_k = \\sqrt{D/k}$ represents the characteristic distance over which concentration gradients, created by boundary conditions, are smoothed out by diffusion before the tracer is removed by the first-order decay process. In the absence of advection ($u=0$), the governing equation simplifies to $D\\frac{d^2c}{dx^2} - kc = -S_0$, or $\\frac{d^2c}{dx^2} - \\frac{1}{L_k^2}c = -\\frac{S_0}{D}$. The solution involves terms like $\\cosh(x/L_k)$ and $\\sinh(x/L_k)$, clearly showing that $L_k$ sets the spatial scale over which the solution adjusts from a value of zero at the boundaries towards the equilibrium concentration $S_0/k$ in the interior. When advection is present, this fundamental scale is modified by the flow, resulting in the combined parameter $q = \\sqrt{(u/2D)^2 + 1/L_k^2}$, but $L_k$ remains the key parameter that defines the balance between diffusion and reaction. The influence of the \"perfect sink\" boundaries at $x=0$ and $x=L$ penetrates into the channel over a distance related to $L_k$, creating \"boundary layers\" in the concentration profile.",

            "solution": "The problem is assessed as valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard problem in transport phenomena that is self-contained and free of contradictions.\n\nThe solution process will follow the three parts outlined in the problem statement, followed by a numerical evaluation.\n\n**1. Governing Equation Derivation**\n\nThe principle of local mass conservation for the depth-integrated areal concentration $C(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ in two dimensions is expressed by the continuity equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{x} = (x, y)$, $\\nabla = (\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y})$ is the horizontal gradient operator, and $\\mathbf{J}$ is the total horizontal flux vector of the scalar.\n\nThe total flux $\\mathbf{J}$ is the sum of the advective flux due to the mean wind and the diffusive flux due to turbulence.\nThe advective flux is given by $\\mathbf{J}_{\\text{adv}} = C\\mathbf{U}$, where $\\mathbf{U}$ is the uniform mean wind vector.\nThe turbulent diffusive flux, according to the Fickian closure, is given by $\\mathbf{J}_{\\text{diff}} = -\\mathbf{D} \\nabla C$, where $\\mathbf{D}$ is the turbulent diffusivity tensor.\n\nThe total flux is therefore:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J} = C\\mathbf{U} - \\mathbf{D} \\nabla C\n$$\n\nSubstituting this into the conservation equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (C\\mathbf{U} - \\mathbf{D} \\nabla C) = 0\n$$\nWe can expand the divergence term:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot (C\\mathbf{U} - \\mathbf{D} \\nabla C) = \\nabla \\cdot (C\\mathbf{U}) - \\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbf{D} \\nabla C)\n$$\nFor the advective part, using the product rule for divergence: $\\nabla \\cdot (C\\mathbf{U}) = (\\nabla C) \\cdot \\mathbf{U} + C(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{U})$. Since the mean wind $\\mathbf{U}$ is given as spatially uniform, its divergence is zero: $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{U} = 0$. Thus, the term simplifies to $\\nabla \\cdot (C\\mathbf{U}) = \\mathbf{U} \\cdot \\nabla C$.\n\nFor the diffusive part, the operator is $\\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbf{D} \\nabla C)$. In component form, this is $\\sum_{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} \\left( \\sum_{j} D_{ij} \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x_j} \\right)$. Since the diffusivity tensor $\\mathbf{D}$ is also given as spatially uniform, its components $D_{ij}$ are constants and can be pulled out of the outer differentiation, yielding $\\sum_{i,j} D_{ij} \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x_i \\partial x_j}$.\n\nCombining these results, the governing advection-dispersion equation for $C(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{U} \\cdot \\nabla C = \\sum_{i,j} D_{ij} \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x_i \\partial x_j}\n$$\nThis can also be written in vector notation as $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{U} \\cdot \\nabla C = \\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbf{D} \\nabla C)$.\n\n**2. Diagonalization of the Diffusivity Tensor**\n\nThe diffusivity tensor $\\mathbf{D}$ is given as a real, symmetric, positive-definite matrix. The spectral theorem of linear algebra states that any real symmetric matrix can be diagonalized by an orthogonal matrix. Specifically, there exists an orthogonal matrix $\\mathbf{R}$ (whose columns are the orthonormal eigenvectors of $\\mathbf{D}$) and a diagonal matrix $\\mathbf{D}'$ (whose entries are the corresponding eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{D}$) such that:\n$$\n\\mathbf{D} = \\mathbf{R} \\mathbf{D}' \\mathbf{R}^T\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{R}^T \\mathbf{R} = \\mathbf{R} \\mathbf{R}^T = \\mathbf{I}$, the identity matrix. Since $\\mathbf{D}$ is positive-definite, its eigenvalues $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2$ (the diagonal elements of $\\mathbf{D}'$) are all positive.\n\nLet us introduce a new coordinate system $\\mathbf{x}' = (x', y')$ which is a rotation of the original system $\\mathbf{x} = (x, y)$. This rotation aligns the new coordinate axes with the principal axes (eigenvectors) of $\\mathbf{D}$. The transformation is given by $\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{R}^T \\mathbf{x}$. The inverse transformation is $\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{R} \\mathbf{x}'$.\n\nWe must transform the diffusion operator $\\sum_{i,j} D_{ij} \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x_i \\partial x_j}$ into the new coordinates. The chain rule for partial derivatives gives the relationship between the gradient operators: $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}} = \\mathbf{R} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}'}$. The second partial derivatives transform as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x_i \\partial x_j} = \\sum_{k,l} \\frac{\\partial x'_k}{\\partial x_i} \\frac{\\partial x'_l}{\\partial x_j} \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x'_k \\partial x'_l} = \\sum_{k,l} (R^T)_{ki} (R^T)_{lj} \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x'_k \\partial x'_l}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the diffusion operator:\n$$\n\\sum_{i,j} D_{ij} \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x_i \\partial x_j} = \\sum_{i,j} D_{ij} \\left( \\sum_{k,l} (R^T)_{ki} (R^T)_{lj} \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x'_k \\partial x'_l} \\right)\n$$\nRearranging the order of summation:\n$$\n= \\sum_{k,l} \\left( \\sum_{i,j} (R^T)_{ki} D_{ij} R_{jl} \\right) \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x'_k \\partial x'_l}\n$$\nThe term in parentheses is the $(k,l)$-th element of the matrix product $\\mathbf{R}^T \\mathbf{D} \\mathbf{R}$. From the diagonalization of $\\mathbf{D}$, we know $\\mathbf{R}^T \\mathbf{D} \\mathbf{R} = \\mathbf{D}'$. Since $\\mathbf{D}'$ is a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2$, its $(k,l)$-th element is $\\lambda_k \\delta_{kl}$ (where $\\delta_{kl}$ is the Kronecker delta).\n\nThe diffusion operator thus simplifies to:\n$$\n\\sum_{k,l} (\\lambda_k \\delta_{kl}) \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x'_k \\partial x'_l} = \\sum_{k} \\lambda_k \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial (x'_k)^2} = \\lambda_1 \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial (x')^2} + \\lambda_2 \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial (y')^2}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that in the rotated principal-coordinate system, the diffusion operator decouples into a sum of second derivatives along the principal directions, with diffusivities equal to the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{D}$.\n\n**3. Analytical Solution**\n\nTo solve the governing PDE, we employ two transformations. First, we transform to a moving frame of reference to eliminate the advection term. Let $\\mathbf{x}'' = \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{U}t$. Let $C(\\mathbf{x}, t) = C'(\\mathbf{x}'', t)$. The partial derivatives transform as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial C'}{\\partial t} - \\mathbf{U} \\cdot \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}''}C' \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}}C = \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}''}C'\n$$\nSubstituting these into the PDE gives:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial C'}{\\partial t} - \\mathbf{U} \\cdot \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}''}C' \\right) + \\mathbf{U} \\cdot \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}''}C' = \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}''} \\cdot (\\mathbf{D} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}''} C')\n$$\nThis simplifies to a pure diffusion equation in the moving frame:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C'}{\\partial t} = \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}''} \\cdot (\\mathbf{D} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}''} C')\n$$\nNext, we apply the rotation of coordinates from Part 2. In the rotated, moving frame $\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{R}^T \\mathbf{x}''$, the PDE becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C'}{\\partial t} = \\lambda_1 \\frac{\\partial^2 C'}{\\partial (x')^2} + \\lambda_2 \\frac{\\partial^2 C'}{\\partial (y')^2}\n$$\nThe initial condition is an instantaneous point release of mass $M$ at the origin at $t=0$, which can be represented by a Dirac delta function: $C(\\mathbf{x}, 0) = M \\delta(\\mathbf{x})$. In the transformed coordinates, this remains $C'(\\mathbf{x}', 0) = M \\delta(\\mathbf{x}')$.\n\nThe solution to this decoupled 2D diffusion equation is the product of two 1D Gaussian kernels:\n$$\nC'(x', y', t) = \\frac{M}{\\sqrt{4\\pi\\lambda_1 t}\\sqrt{4\\pi\\lambda_2 t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x')^2}{4\\lambda_1 t} - \\frac{(y')^2}{4\\lambda_2 t}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nC'(x', y', t) = \\frac{M}{4\\pi t \\sqrt{\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{4t}\\left(\\frac{(x')^2}{\\lambda_1} + \\frac{(y')^2}{\\lambda_2}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThe term in the exponent can be expressed in matrix form as $\\frac{1}{4t}(\\mathbf{x}')^T (\\mathbf{D}')^{-1} \\mathbf{x}'$.\nWe know that $\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 = \\det(\\mathbf{D}')$, and since $\\det(\\mathbf{D}) = \\det(\\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{D}'\\mathbf{R}^T) = \\det(\\mathbf{D}')$, we have $\\sqrt{\\lambda_1\\lambda_2} = \\sqrt{\\det(\\mathbf{D})}$.\n\nTo obtain the solution in the original coordinates, we transform back.\nThe quadratic form in the exponent is $(\\mathbf{x}')^T (\\mathbf{D}')^{-1} \\mathbf{x}'$. We use $\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{R}^T(\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{U}t)$ and $(\\mathbf{D}')^{-1} = \\mathbf{R}^T \\mathbf{D}^{-1} \\mathbf{R}$.\n$$\n(\\mathbf{x}')^T (\\mathbf{D}')^{-1} \\mathbf{x}' = [(\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{U}t)^T \\mathbf{R}] [\\mathbf{R}^T \\mathbf{D}^{-1} \\mathbf{R}] [\\mathbf{R}^T(\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{U}t)]\n$$\n$$\n= (\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{U}t)^T (\\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{R}^T) \\mathbf{D}^{-1} (\\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{R}^T) (\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{U}t) = (\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{U}t)^T \\mathbf{D}^{-1} (\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{U}t)\n$$\nThus, the final analytical solution for $C(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ is:\n$$\nC(\\mathbf{x}, t) = \\frac{M}{4\\pi t \\sqrt{\\det(\\mathbf{D})}} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{(\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{U}t)^T \\mathbf{D}^{-1} (\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{U}t)}{4t} \\right)\n$$\nThis solution represents an anisotropic Gaussian distribution. Its peak (mean) is located at $\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{U}t$, which confirms that the center of mass of the scalar cloud advects with the mean wind. The spread of the cloud is determined by the term in the exponent. The level sets of $C$ (contours of constant concentration) are defined by $(\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{U}t)^T \\mathbf{D}^{-1} (\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{U}t) = \\text{constant}$. Since $\\mathbf{D}$ is symmetric positive-definite, so is its inverse $\\mathbf{D}^{-1}$.

Central differencing for the first derivative $dC/dx$ at interior nodes.\n  2.

            "solution": "The task is to solve the one-dimensional steady advection-dispersion equation and analyze the numerical solution's behavior for two different discretization schemes for the advection term. The governing equation is:\n$$ K_T\\,\\frac{d^2 C}{dx^2} - u\\,\\frac{dC}{dx} = 0 $$\nLet the grid points be $x_i = (i-1)h$ for $i=1, \\dots, N$, where $h = L/(N-1)$. The concentration at these points is denoted by $C_i = C(x_i)$. The boundary values are known: $C_1 = C_{\\text{left}}$ and $C_N = C_{\\text{right}}$. We need to find the concentrations $C_2, \\dots, C_{N-1}$ at the $N-2$ interior points.\n\nAt any interior node $x_i$, we discretize the derivatives. The second-order central difference for the diffusive term is:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 C}{dx^2}\\bigg|_{x_i} \\approx \\frac{C_{i+1} - 2C_i + C_{i-1}}{h^2} $$\n\n#### 1. Central Differencing Scheme\n\nThe advection term is discretized using a second-order central difference:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dx}\\bigg|_{x_i} \\approx \\frac{C_{i+1} - C_{i-1}}{2h} $$\nSubstituting these into the governing equation gives:\n$$ K_T \\left(\\frac{C_{i+1} - 2C_i + C_{i-1}}{h^2}\\right) - u \\left(\\frac{C_{i+1} - C_{i-1}}{2h}\\right) = 0 $$\nMultiplying by $h^2$ and rearranging terms to group by $C_j$:\n$$ (K_T + \\frac{uh}{2})C_{i-1} - 2K_T C_i + (K_T - \\frac{uh}{2})C_{i+1} = 0 $$\nThis equation holds for each interior node $i = 2, \\dots, N-1$. This forms a system of $N-2$ linear equations for the $N-2$ unknown interior concentrations. The structure is tridiagonal:\n$$ a_i C_{i-1} + b_i C_i + c_i C_{i+1} = 0 $$\nwhere $a_i = K_T + \\frac{uh}{2}$, $b_i = -2K_T$, and $c_i = K_T - \\frac{uh}{2}$.\n\nThe well-known stability condition for this scheme to avoid oscillations is that the cell Péclet number $\\mathrm{Pe}_h = |u|h/K_T$ must be less than or equal to $2$. If $\\mathrm{Pe}_h > 2$, the coefficient $c_i$ (for $u>0$) or $a_i$ (for $u0$) becomes negative, which can lead to non-physical oscillations, as the matrix of the linear system is no longer guaranteed to be an M-matrix.\n\n#### 2. First-Order Upwind Scheme\n\nThis scheme uses a one-sided difference for the advection term, chosen based on the direction of flow (the sign of $u$).\n-   **If $u \\ge 0$ (flow from left to right):** Use a backward difference, as information is coming from the upstream node $i-1$.\n    $$ \\frac{dC}{dx}\\bigg|_{x_i} \\approx \\frac{C_i - C_{i-1}}{h} $$\n    The discretized equation becomes:\n    $$ K_T \\left(\\frac{C_{i+1} - 2C_i + C_{i-1}}{h^2}\\right) - u \\left(\\frac{C_i - C_{i-1}}{h}\\right) = 0 $$\n    Grouping terms:\n    $$ (K_T + uh)C_{i-1} - (2K_T + uh)C_i + K_T C_{i+1} = 0 $$\n    The coefficients are $a_i = K_T + uh$, $b_i = -(2K_T + uh)$, and $c_i = K_T$.\n-   **If $u  0$ (flow from right to left):** Use a forward difference, as information comes from the upstream node $i+1$.\n    $$ \\frac{dC}{dx}\\bigg|_{x_i} \\approx \\frac{C_{i+1} - C_i}{h} $$\n    The discretized equation becomes:\n    $$ K_T \\left(\\frac{C_{i+1} - 2C_i + C_{i-1}}{h^2}\\right) - u \\left(\\frac{C_{i+1} - C_i}{h}\\right) = 0 $$\n    Grouping terms:\n    $$ K_T C_{i-1} - (2K_T - uh)C_i + (K_T - uh)C_{i+1} = 0 $$\n    The coefficients are $a_i = K_T$, $b_i = -(2K_T - uh)$, and $c_i = K_T - uh$.\n\nThe upwind scheme is unconditionally stable and will not produce spurious oscillations, though it is only first-order accurate and introduces numerical diffusion.\n\n#### 3. Assembling and Solving the Linear System\n\nFor both schemes, we have a system of $N-2$ linear equations of the form $a C_{i-1} + b C_i + c C_{i+1} = 0$ for $i=2, \\dots, N-1$. We must incorporate the boundary conditions.\n-   For the first interior node ($i=2$): $a C_1 + b C_2 + c C_3 = 0$. Since $C_1 = C_{\\text{left}}$ is known, we move this term to the right-hand side: $b C_2 + c C_3 = -a C_{\\text{left}}$.\n-   For the last interior node ($i=N-1$): $a C_{N-2} + b C_{N-1} + c C_N = 0$. Since $C_N = C_{\\text{right}}$ is known, we have: $a C_{N-2} + b C_{N-1} = -c C_{\\text{right}}$.\n\nThis forms a tridiagonal linear system $\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{C}_{\\text{int}} = \\mathbf{d}$, where $\\mathbf{C}_{\\text{int}} = [C_2, \\dots, C_{N-1}]^T$ is the vector of unknowns. The matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ has diagonals formed by the coefficients $a, b, c$, and the right-hand side vector $\\mathbf{d}$ contains the boundary terms. This system can be solved using a standard linear algebra library routine.\n\n#### 4. Computing the Metrics\n\nOnce the full concentration vector $\\mathbf{C} = [C_1, \\dots, C_N]^T$ is obtained, the required metrics are computed:\n-   $\\mathrm{Pe}_h = |u|h/K_T$.\n-   $M$: The monotonicity flag is set to `True` if $C_{i+1} - C_i \\le 10^{-10}$ for all $i=1, \\dots, N-1$.\n-   $A$: The oscillation amplitude is calculated as $\\max(0, \\max(C_{i+1} - C_i))$ over all $i=1, \\dots, N-1$.\n\nThe following code implements this procedure for the given test cases.",
