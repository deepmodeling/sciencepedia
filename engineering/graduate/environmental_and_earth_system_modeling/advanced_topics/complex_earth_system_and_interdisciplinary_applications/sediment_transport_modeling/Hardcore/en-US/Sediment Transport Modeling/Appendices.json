            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an expression for the bed shear stress, $\\tau_b$, in a steady, uniform open-channel flow, and its subsequent numerical evaluation. The derivation will proceed from a momentum balance on a fluid control volume.\n\nConsider a control volume of length $L$ in a prismatic channel with cross-sectional area $A$ and wetted perimeter $P$. The flow is steady and uniform, meaning the flow depth, velocity, and cross-sectional area are constant along the length $L$. The channel bed slopes at a small angle $\\theta$, with the slope defined as $S_0 = \\tan(\\theta)$. For small angles, $\\sin(\\theta) \\approx S_0$.\n\nThe momentum equation for the control volume in the direction of flow dictates that the sum of all external forces is zero since there is no acceleration. The forces acting on the fluid are:\n$1$. The component of the fluid's weight acting parallel to the channel bed.\n$2$. The shear force exerted by the channel bed and walls on the fluid.\n$3$. The pressure forces on the upstream and downstream faces of the control volume.\n\nFor uniform flow, the flow depths at the upstream and downstream faces are identical. Consequently, the hydrostatic pressure distributions are identical, and the pressure forces cancel each other out. Thus, the momentum balance reduces to an equilibrium between the gravitational driving force and the resistive shear force.\n\nThe gravitational force component in the direction of flow, $F_g$, is given by the weight of the fluid in the control volume, $W$, multiplied by $\\sin(\\theta)$:\n$$F_g = W \\sin(\\theta)$$\nThe weight $W$ is the product of the fluid volume ($A \\times L$), density $\\rho$, and gravitational acceleration $g$:\n$$W = \\rho g A L$$\nThus, using the approximation $\\sin(\\theta) \\approx S_0$:\n$$F_g = \\rho g A L S_0$$\n\nThe total shear force, $F_f$, exerted by the channel boundary on the fluid is the product of the average shear stress, $\\tau_b$, and the wetted surface area. The wetted area is the wetted perimeter $P$ multiplied by the length $L$:\n$$F_f = \\tau_b P L$$\n\nIn steady, uniform flow, these two forces must be in balance:\n$$F_g = F_f$$\n$$\\rho g A L S_0 = \\tau_b P L$$\n\nSolving for the bed shear stress $\\tau_b$ by dividing by $P L$ yields:\n$$\\tau_b = \\rho g \\frac{A}{P} S_0$$\nBy definition, the hydraulic radius is $R = \\frac{A}{P}$. Substituting this into the equation gives the fundamental relationship for shear stress in uniform flow:\n$$\\tau_b = \\rho g R S_0$$\n\nThe next step is to relate the channel slope $S_0$ to the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor $f$. The Darcy-Weisbach equation quantifies the head loss $h_f$ over a length $L$ due to friction:\n$$h_f = f \\frac{L}{D_h} \\frac{U^2}{2g}$$\nwhere $U$ is the mean velocity and $D_h$ is the hydraulic diameter. The problem specifies that $D_h = 4R$. Substituting this definition gives:\n$$h_f = f \\frac{L}{4R} \\frac{U^2}{2g}$$\n\nFor uniform flow, the energy grade line is parallel to the water surface and the channel bed. This means the energy gradient, $S_f = \\frac{h_f}{L}$, is equal to the bed slope, $S_0$.\n$$S_0 = S_f = \\frac{h_f}{L} = f \\frac{1}{4R} \\frac{U^2}{2g} = \\frac{f U^2}{8gR}$$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $S_0$ back into our equation for shear stress, $\\tau_b = \\rho g R S_0$:\n$$\\tau_b = \\rho g R \\left( \\frac{f U^2}{8gR} \\right)$$\nThe terms for gravitational acceleration $g$ and hydraulic radius $R$ cancel out, leaving the desired expression for bed shear stress in terms of $f$, $\\rho$, and $U$:\n$$\\tau_b = \\frac{f \\rho U^2}{8}$$\n\nThis completes the derivation. Now, we evaluate $\\tau_b$ using the provided numerical values:\nMean velocity, $U = 1.0 \\ \\text{m s}^{-1}$\nDarcy-Weisbach friction factor, $f = 0.04$\nFluid density, $\\rho = 1000 \\ \\text{kg m}^{-3}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$\\tau_b = \\frac{(0.04) (1000) (1.0)^2}{8}$$\n$$\\tau_b = \\frac{40}{8}$$\n$$\\tau_b = 5.0$$\nThe unit of shear stress is Pascals ($Pa$). This can be verified from the units of the terms: $(\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-3}) \\cdot (\\text{m} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1})^2 = \\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-2} = \\text{N} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-2} = \\text{Pa}$.\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

            "solution": "The core principle for this derivation is the conservation of mass for the sediment comprising the river bed. We consider a one-dimensional system where all quantities vary only with the downstream coordinate $x$ and time $t$. Let us define a control volume (CV) for the bed material. This CV is a small segment of the river bed of length $\\Delta x$ along the $x$-axis and has a unit width perpendicular to the flow direction. The bed elevation relative to a fixed datum is $\\eta(x,t)$.\n\nThe mass of sediment, $M_{\\text{sed}}$, within this control volume is the product of the sediment density, $\\rho_s$, the volume of sediment grains, and the volume of the bed slice occupied by the grains. The total volume of the bed slice per unit width is approximated as $\\eta \\Delta x$ for small $\\Delta x$. The sediment grains occupy a fraction $(1-\\lambda_p)$ of this total volume, where $\\lambda_p$ is the porosity of the bed material. Therefore, the mass of sediment in the control volume is given by:\n$$ M_{\\text{sed}} = \\rho_s (1-\\lambda_p) A_{\\text{bed}} $$\nwhere $A_{\\text{bed}}$ is the cross-sectional area of the bed slice.

Assuming the sediment density $\\rho_s$ and porosity $\\lambda_p$ are constant, we can write:\n$$ \\frac{dM_{\\text{sed}}}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left[ \\rho_s (1-\\lambda_p) \\int_{x}^{x+\\Delta x} \\eta(x', t) \\, dx' \\right] = \\rho_s (1-\\lambda_p) \\int_{x}^{x+\\Delta x} \\frac{\\partial \\eta(x', t)}{\\partial t} \\, dx' $$\nHere, we have used the Leibniz integral rule, noting that the limits of integration are fixed with respect to time.\n\nThe mass flux of sediment is the product of the sediment density $\\rho_s$ and the volumetric sediment transport rate per unit width, $q_s(x,t)$.\nThe rate of mass flux into the CV at position $x$ is $\\dot{M}_{\\text{in}} = \\rho_s q_s(x,t)$.\nThe rate of mass flux out of the CV at position $x+\\Delta x$ is $\\dot{M}_{\\text{out}} = \\rho_s q_s(x+\\Delta x, t)$.\nThe net mass flux into the control volume is therefore:\n$$ \\dot{M}_{\\text{in}} - \\dot{M}_{\\text{out}} = \\rho_s q_s(x,t) - \\rho_s q_s(x+\\Delta x, t) = - \\rho_s [q_s(x+\\Delta x, t) - q_s(x,t)] $$\n\nEquating the rate of change of mass with the net mass flux:\n$$ \\rho_s (1-\\lambda_p) \\int_{x}^{x+\\Delta x} \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t} \\, dx' = - \\rho_s [q_s(x+\\Delta x, t) - q_s(x,t)] $$\nThe sediment density $\\rho_s$ is a common factor and cancels out, which is expected as we are dealing with volumetric conservation:\n$$ (1-\\lambda_p) \\int_{x}^{x+\\Delta x} \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t} \\, dx' = - [q_s(x+\\Delta x, t) - q_s(x,t)] $$\n\nTo obtain the differential form of the equation, we divide both sides by $\\Delta x$ and take the limit as $\\Delta x \\to 0$.\n$$ \\lim_{\\Delta x \\to 0} \\left[ (1-\\lambda_p) \\frac{1}{\\Delta x} \\int_{x}^{x+\\Delta x} \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t} \\, dx' \\right] = \\lim_{\\Delta x \\to 0} \\left[ - \\frac{q_s(x+\\Delta x, t) - q_s(x,t)}{\\Delta x} \\right] $$\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (or the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals), the left-hand side becomes:\n$$ (1-\\lambda_p) \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t} $$\nBy the definition of the partial derivative, the right-hand side becomes:\n$$ - \\frac{\\partial q_s}{\\partial x} $$\nCombining these results gives the one-dimensional Exner equation for sediment conservation:\n$$ (1-\\lambda_p) \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t} = - \\frac{\\partial q_s}{\\partial x} $$\nIsolating the bed elevation change rate, $\\partial \\eta / \\partial t$, we obtain the final relation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t} = - \\frac{1}{1-\\lambda_p} \\frac{\\partial q_s}{\\partial x} $$\n\nThe main assumptions made are that the bed material porosity $\\lambda_p$ and the sediment grain density $\\rho_s$ are constant in space and time. The sign convention used is that $x$ increases downstream and $\\eta$ is measured upward, such that $\\partial \\eta / \\partial t  0$ denotes aggradation.\n\nLet's check the dimensional consistency. The units of $\\partial \\eta / \\partial t$ are length per time, $[\\mathrm{L}]/[\\mathrm{T}]$. The porosity $\\lambda_p$ is dimensionless. The volumetric transport rate per unit width, $q_s$, has units of $(\\mathrm{L}^3/\\mathrm{T})/\\mathrm{L} = \\mathrm{L}^2/\\mathrm{T}$. The gradient $\\partial q_s / \\partial x$ has units of $(\\mathrm{L}^2/\\mathrm{T})/\\mathrm{L} = \\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{T}$.\nThus, the equation $\\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t} = - \\frac{1}{1-\\lambda_p} \\frac{\\partial q_s}{\\partial x}$ is dimensionally consistent: $[\\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{T}] = \\frac{1}{[1]} [\\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{T}]$.\n\nPhysically, if the sediment transport rate decreases downstream ($\\partial q_s / \\partial x  0$), more sediment enters a reach than leaves it. This leads to deposition, or aggradation, meaning the bed elevation should increase ($\\partial \\eta / \\partial t  0$). Our derived equation confirms this: if $\\partial q_s / \\partial x$ is negative, the right-hand side becomes positive, correctly predicting aggradation.\n\nNow, we evaluate the bed aggradation rate for the given values:\n$\\partial q_{s}/\\partial x = -1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1} = -1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n$\\lambda_{p} = 0.4$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t} = - \\frac{1}{1-0.4} \\left( -1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t} = - \\frac{1}{0.6} \\left( -1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-4}}{0.6} \\, \\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t} = \\left( \\frac{1}{0.6} \\right) \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\approx 1.6666... \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t} \\approx 1.667 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nThis positive value indicates bed aggradation, which is consistent with the negative gradient of the sediment transport rate.",
