            "problem": "Consider a symmetric street canyon idealized as an infinitely long three-surface enclosure with a fourth fictitious opening representing the sky. The canyon cross-section consists of two identical vertical walls and a horizontal road. Let the road have width $W$ and unit length $L$ along the street direction, so its area is $A_{G} = W L$. Each wall has height $H$ and the same unit length $L$, so each wall area is $A_{L} = A_{R} = H L$. The sky opening is the rectangular aperture above the canyon with area $A_{S} = W L$.\n\nAssume all surfaces are diffuse and gray, and treat radiative exchange using view factors (also called configuration factors). You may use only the following fundamental laws and definitions:\n\n- The definition of a view factor $F_{i \\to j}$ as the fraction of total diffuse radiant energy leaving surface $i$ that is intercepted by surface $j$.\n- The summation rule: for each surface $i$, $\\sum_{j} F_{i \\to j} = 1$.\n- The reciprocity rule: for any pair of surfaces $i$ and $j$, $A_{i} F_{i \\to j} = A_{j} F_{j \\to i}$.\n- A planar surface does not see itself, so $F_{i \\to i} = 0$.\n\nLet $x \\equiv F_{G \\to S}$ denote the road’s view factor to the sky, which is a geometric quantity determined by the canyon aspect ratio $H/W$ but need not be evaluated here.\n\nUsing only the rules above and geometric symmetry, derive and present the complete $4 \\times 4$ view factor matrix $\\mathbf{F}$ for the ordered surface set $(G, L, R, S)$, expressed in terms of $x$ and the aspect ratio $H/W$. The matrix entry in row $i$ and column $j$ must be $F_{i \\to j}$. Express the final matrix as a closed-form analytic expression. No numerical evaluation is required.

It is a well-posed problem in radiative heat transfer, grounded in established physical principles and free of scientific or logical flaws. The provided information is self-contained and sufficient to derive a unique solution using the specified rules.\n\nThe objective is to determine the $4 \\times 4$ view factor matrix $\\mathbf{F}$ for an enclosure composed of four surfaces: ground ($G$), left wall ($L$), right wall ($R$), and sky ($S$). The matrix element $F_{i \\to j}$ represents the fraction of radiation leaving surface $i$ that is intercepted by surface $j$. The derivation will exclusively use the summation rule, the reciprocity rule, the planar surface rule, and geometric symmetry, as stipulated.\n\nThe surfaces are ordered as $(G, L, R, S)$, corresponding to indices $(1, 2, 3, 4)$ in the matrix. The areas of the surfaces are:\n- Road/Ground: $A_G = W L$\n- Left Wall: $A_L = H L$\n- Right Wall: $A_R = H L$\n- Sky Opening: $A_S = W L$\n\nWe are given the view factor from the ground to the sky as $F_{G \\to S} = x$. We will now derive all $16$ elements of the matrix $\\mathbf{F}$ systematically.\n\n**1. Diagonal Elements ($F_{i \\to i}$)**\nAll four surfaces—ground, walls, and the fictitious sky opening—are planar. According to the provided rules, a planar surface cannot see itself.

Thus, $F_{G \\to L} = F_{G \\to R}$.\n$$2 F_{G \\to L} = 1 - x \\implies F_{G \\to L} = F_{G \\to R} = \\frac{1 - x}{2}$$\nThe first row of the matrix is therefore $(0, \\frac{1-x}{2}, \\frac{1-x}{2}, x)$.\n\n**3.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of radiative heat transfer, is well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient information, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the vector of absorbed shortwave fluxes, $\\mathbf{A}$, for a three-surface urban canyon model. The derivation is founded on the principle of energy conservation for a system of diffusely reflecting surfaces, formalized using the radiosity method.\n\nFirst, we define the radiosity of a surface. The radiosity, $J_i$, of a surface $i$ represents the total shortwave radiation flux leaving the surface per unit area. Since the surfaces are assumed to be Lambertian and shortwave emission is negligible, the radiosity is solely due to the reflection of incident radiation. The total shortwave irradiance incident upon surface $i$ is $E_i$, and its shortwave albedo is $\\alpha_i$. Therefore, the radiosity is given by:\n$$\nJ_i = \\alpha_i E_i\n$$\nThis relationship can be expressed for all three surfaces—the road ($r$), wall $1$ ($w_1$), and wall $2$ ($w_2$)—using the defined matrix and vector notation. The albedo matrix $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} = \\mathrm{diag}(\\alpha_{r}, \\alpha_{w}, \\alpha_{w})$ is a diagonal matrix containing the surface albedos. The radiosity vector $\\mathbf{J}$ and the irradiance vector $\\mathbf{E}$ are column vectors. The system of equations for all three surfaces is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J} = \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} \\mathbf{E}\n$$\n\nNext, we establish an expression for the total shortwave irradiance, $E_i$, incident on each surface $i$. This irradiance is composed of two components: direct irradiance from the sky and indirect irradiance from the other surfaces in the canyon.\n1.  **Irradiance from the sky**: The sky is an isotropic source of downwelling shortwave irradiance, $S$. The fraction of this radiation that reaches surface $i$ is determined by the sky view factor, $F_{iS}$. Thus, the irradiance on surface $i$ from the sky is $S F_{iS}$.\n2.  **Irradiance from other surfaces**: Each surface $j$ in the canyon emits a radiative flux (its radiosity, $J_j$). The fraction of this flux that is intercepted by surface $i$ is given by the view factor $F_{ij}$. The total irradiance on surface $i$ from all other surfaces is the sum $\\sum_{j} F_{ij} J_j$.\n\nCombining these components, the total irradiance on surface $i$ is:\n$$\nE_i = S F_{iS} + \\sum_{j \\in \\{r, w_1, w_2\\}} F_{ij} J_j\n$$\nUsing the provided matrix-vector notation, this system of equations for the three surfaces can be written as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{E} = S \\mathbf{f}_{S} + \\mathbf{F} \\mathbf{J}\n$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{f}_{S}$ is the column vector of sky view factors and $\\mathbf{F}$ is the matrix of inter-surface view factors.\n\nWe now have a system of two linear matrix equations:\n$$\n(1) \\quad \\mathbf{J} = \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} \\mathbf{E}\n$$\n$$\n(2) \\quad \\mathbf{E} = S \\mathbf{f}_{S} + \\mathbf{F} \\mathbf{J}\n$$\nTo solve for the unknown fluxes, we can substitute equation ($1$) into equation ($2$):\n$$\n\\mathbf{E} = S \\mathbf{f}_{S} + \\mathbf{F} (\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} \\mathbf{E})\n$$\nRearranging to solve for the irradiance vector $\\mathbf{E}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{E} - (\\mathbf{F} \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}) \\mathbf{E} = S \\mathbf{f}_{S}\n$$\nLet $\\mathbf{I}$ be the $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix. We can factor out $\\mathbf{E}$:\n$$\n(\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{F} \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}) \\mathbf{E} = S \\mathbf{f}_{S}\n$$\nTo isolate $\\mathbf{E}$, we pre-multiply by the inverse of the matrix $(\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{F} \\boldsymbol{\\alpha})$. This inverse exists for all physical scenarios where albedos are less than $1$.\n$$\n\\mathbf{E} = (\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{F} \\boldsymbol{\\alpha})^{-1} S \\mathbf{f}_{S}\n$$\nThis equation gives the total shortwave irradiance on each surface, accounting for all orders of multiple reflections within the canyon. The term $(\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{F} \\boldsymbol{\\alpha})^{-1}$ acts as a \"multiple scattering\" operator, which can be seen by its Neumann series expansion $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (\\mathbf{F}\\boldsymbol{\\alpha})^k = \\mathbf{I} + \\mathbf{F}\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} + (\\mathbf{F}\\boldsymbol{\\alpha})^2 + \\dots$.\n\nFinally, we need to find the absorbed shortwave flux vector, $\\mathbf{A}$. The absorbed flux for surface $i$, $A_i$, is the portion of the incident flux, $E_i$, that is not reflected. This is given by:\n$$\nA_i = E_i - J_i = E_i - \\alpha_i E_i = (1 - \\alpha_i) E_i\n$$\nIn matrix form, this can be written as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{A} = (\\mathbf{I} - \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}) \\mathbf{E}\n$$\nwhere $(\\mathbf{I} - \\boldsymbol{\\alpha})$ is a diagonal matrix of the surface absorptivities.\n\nSubstituting our derived expression for $\\mathbf{E}$ into this equation gives the final result for the absorbed flux vector:\n$$\n\\mathbf{A} = (\\mathbf{I} - \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}) \\left( (\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{F} \\boldsymbol{\\alpha})^{-1} S \\mathbf{f}_{S} \\right)\n$$\nSince $S$ is a scalar quantity, it can be moved to the front of the expression for clarity:\n$$\n\\mathbf{A} = S (\\mathbf{I} - \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}) (\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{F} \\boldsymbol{\\alpha})^{-1} \\mathbf{f}_{S}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the vector of absorbed shortwave fluxes on the road and two walls, as requested. It is a function of the sky irradiance $S$, the albedos encapsulated in $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$, the inter-surface view factors in $\\mathbf{F}$, and the sky view factors in $\\mathbf{f}_{S}$.",

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective, containing all necessary information for a solution.\n\nThe analysis begins with the surface energy balance equation for an urban canopy volume, which states that the sum of all energy fluxes into and out of the volume must be zero. The equation is typically written as:\n$$\nQ^{*} + Q_A = Q_H + Q_E + \\Delta Q_S\n$$\nwhere $Q^{*}$ is the net radiation flux, $Q_A$ is the anthropogenic heat flux, $Q_H$ is the turbulent sensible heat flux, $Q_E$ is the turbulent latent heat flux (evapotranspiration), and $\\Delta Q_S$ is the net change in heat storage within the urban fabric (buildings, roads, etc.). All fluxes are expressed per unit horizontal area, typically in $\\mathrm{W \\, m^{-2}}$.\n\nThe problem specifies conditions of a stable winter night, for which it is assumed that the latent heat flux is negligible ($Q_E \\approx 0$) and the urban fabric is in near-thermal equilibrium with its surroundings, implying a negligible change in heat storage ($\\Delta Q_S \\approx 0$). Applying these assumptions to the energy balance equation yields a simplified relationship for the nocturnal period:\n$$\nQ^{*} + Q_A \\approx Q_H\n$$\nThe problem asks for the increment in the sensible heat flux, $Q_H$, that is attributable to the anthropogenic heat flux, $Q_A$, while holding the net radiation $Q^*$ constant. Let us denote the sensible heat flux in the absence of anthropogenic heating ($Q_A = 0$) as $Q_{H,0}$. Under this hypothetical condition, the energy balance would be $Q^{*} \\approx Q_{H,0}$. The increment in sensible heat flux, $\\Delta Q_H$, is the difference between the flux with anthropogenic heating and the flux without it:\n$$\n\\Delta Q_H = Q_H - Q_{H,0} \\approx (Q^{*} + Q_A) - Q^{*} = Q_A\n$$\nThus, the increment in the sensible heat flux is equal to the anthropogenic heat flux itself. The problem requires the mean increment over the nocturnal period $h \\in \\{23, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$, which is equivalent to calculating the mean anthropogenic heat flux, $\\overline{Q_A}$, over this $7$-hour interval.\n\nThe anthropogenic heat flux $Q_A(h)$ for a given hour $h$ is the total heat released from energy consumption within the district, divided by the district's area $A$. The heat release is the sum of contributions from electricity and natural gas consumption. The total power released as heat into the urban canopy, $P_{release}(h)$, is given by:\n$$\nP_{release}(h) = P_e(h) \\epsilon_e \\rho_e + P_g(h) \\epsilon_g \\rho_g\n$$\nwhere $P_e(h)$ and $P_g(h)$ are the power consumption values for electricity and gas, $\\epsilon_e$ and $\\epsilon_g$ are the conversion efficiencies to heat, and $\\rho_e$ and $\\rho_g$ are the fractions of this heat immediately released to the canopy layer. The flux $Q_A(h)$ is then:\n$$\nQ_A(h) = \\frac{P_{release}(h)}{A} = \\frac{P_e(h) \\epsilon_e \\rho_e + P_g(h) \\epsilon_g \\rho_g}{A}\n$$\nThe given parameters are:\nArea, $A = 2.5 \\times 10^{6} \\, \\mathrm{m}^2$.\nElectricity parameters: $\\epsilon_e = 1.00$, $\\rho_e = 0.60$.
