            "problem": "Aqueous carbonate chemistry in seawater can be modeled from fundamental laws of mass conservation, electroneutrality (charge balance), and chemical equilibrium. You are to compute the acidity, quantified as the negative base-10 logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration $pH = -\\log_{10}([\\text{H}^+])$, and the carbon dioxide partial pressure $p\\text{CO}_2$ for seawater from Total Alkalinity (TA) and Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) at given temperature, salinity, and pressure using widely accepted equilibrium constants for seawater.\n\nThe foundational relationships are as follows. Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) is partitioned among hydrated carbon dioxide ($[\\text{CO}_2]$, which includes $[\\text{H}_2\\text{CO}_3]$), bicarbonate ($[\\text{HCO}_3^-]$), and carbonate ($[\\text{CO}_3^{2-}]$), such that the conservation of mass gives\n$$\n\\mathrm{DIC} = [\\text{CO}_2] + [\\text{HCO}_3^-] + [\\text{CO}_3^{2-}].\n$$\nChemical equilibrium of the carbonic acid system in seawater is governed by two dissociation steps with equilibrium constants $K_1$ and $K_2$:\n$$\nK_1 = \\frac{[\\text{H}^+][\\text{HCO}_3^-]}{[\\text{CO}_2]}, \\qquad K_2 = \\frac{[\\text{H}^+][\\text{CO}_3^{2-}]}{[\\text{HCO}_3^-]}.\n$$\nFrom these, for a given hydrogen ion concentration $[\\text{H}^+]$, the species distribution can be written in terms of $\\mathrm{DIC}$ as\n$$\n\\alpha_0 = 1,\\quad \\alpha_1 = \\frac{K_1}{[\\text{H}^+]},\\quad \\alpha_2 = \\frac{K_1 K_2}{[\\text{H}^+]^2},\\quad\n[\\text{CO}_2] = \\frac{\\mathrm{DIC}}{\\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2},\\quad\n[\\text{HCO}_3^-] = \\frac{\\mathrm{DIC}\\,\\alpha_1}{\\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2},\\quad\n[\\text{CO}_3^{2-}] = \\frac{\\mathrm{DIC}\\,\\alpha_2}{\\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2}.\n$$\nTotal Alkalinity (TA) is defined by the electroneutrality condition and, for this problem, must include the dominant contributions from the carbonate system, borate, water autoionization, and the free proton, expressed as\n$$\n\\mathrm{TA} = [\\text{HCO}_3^-] + 2[\\text{CO}_3^{2-}] + [\\text{B(OH)}_4^-] + [\\text{OH}^-] - [\\text{H}^+],\n$$\nwhere borate alkalinity $[\\text{B(OH)}_4^-]$ follows from the boric acid dissociation constant $K_B$ and the total boron concentration $B_T$ via\n$$\n[\\text{B(OH)}_4^-] = B_T \\frac{K_B}{K_B + [\\text{H}^+]},\n$$\nand water autoionization gives\n$$\n[\\text{OH}^-] = \\frac{K_W}{[\\text{H}^+]}.\n$$\nHenry’s law relates the aqueous carbon dioxide to its partial pressure via the solubility constant $K_0$:\n$$\np\\text{CO}_2 = \\frac{[\\text{CO}_2]}{K_0}.\n$$\nThe constants $K_1$, $K_2$, $K_B$, $K_W$, and $K_0$ depend on temperature and salinity.

The $pK$ values for the carbonic acid equilibria on the total pH scale are given by the refit of Mehrbach by Lueker et al.:\n$$\npK_1 = \\frac{3633.86}{T} - 61.2172 + 9.6777\\ln T - 0.011555\\,S + 0.0001152\\,S^2,\n$$\n$$\npK_2 = \\frac{471.78}{T} + 25.9290 - 3.16967\\ln T - 0.01781\\,S + 0.0001122\\,S^2,\n$$\nwith $K_1 = 10^{-pK_1}$, $K_2 = 10^{-pK_2}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of seawater acidity ($pH$) and carbon dioxide partial pressure ($p\\text{CO}_2$) from four key input parameters: Total Alkalinity ($\\mathrm{TA}$), Dissolved Inorganic Carbon ($\\mathrm{DIC}$), temperature ($T$), and salinity ($S$). The pressure is given as zero decibars, corresponding to surface conditions. This is a classic problem in chemical oceanography, the solution of which relies on solving the system of equations governing the marine carbonate system.\n\nThe analytical procedure is structured as a numerical root-finding problem. The core of the problem is the charge-balance equation, which is represented by the formula for Total Alkalinity. Our goal is to find the hydrogen ion concentration, $[\\text{H}^+]$, that satisfies this equation for the given $\\mathrm{TA}$ and $\\mathrm{DIC}$. Once $[\\text{H}^+]$ is determined, all other quantities, including $pH$ and $p\\text{CO}_2$, can be calculated directly.\n\nThe solution is implemented via the following sequence of steps for each test case:\n\n1.  **Initialization and Unit Conversion**: The input parameters are processed. Temperature, provided in degrees Celsius, is converted to the absolute scale in Kelvin ($T_K = T_C + 273.15$). Total Alkalinity and Dissolved Inorganic Carbon, given in micro-units ($\\mu\\text{eq/kg}$ and $\\mu\\text{mol/kg}$ respectively), are converted to their base units of moles per kilogram of seawater ($\\text{mol/kg}$) by multiplying by $10^{-6}$.\n\n2.  **Calculation of Equilibrium and Solubility Constants**: The chemical equilibria of the carbonate system, borate system, and water autoionization are highly dependent on temperature and salinity. For each set of ($T, S$), the following constants are computed using the specified empirical formulations:\n    -   The first and second dissociation constants of carbonic acid, $K_1$ and $K_2$, from the relations for $pK_1$ and $pK_2$ (Lueker et al. refit). Note that $K = 10^{-pK}$.\n    -   The dissociation constant of boric acid, $K_B$, from its $\\ln K_B$ formulation (Dickson).\n    -   The ionic product of water, $K_W$, from its $\\ln K_W$ formulation (Millero).\n    -   The solubility of $\\text{CO}_2$, $K_0$, from its $\\ln K_0$ formulation (Weiss).\n    -   For constants given as natural logarithms ($\\ln K$), the linear value is found via $K = \\exp(\\ln K)$.\n    -   The total boron concentration, $B_T$, which varies linearly with salinity, is also calculated as $B_T = 0.0004157 \\cdot (S/35)$.\n\n3.  **Defining the Root-Finding Function**: The central task is to solve for $[\\text{H}^+]$. This is achieved by finding the root of the residual function $f([\\text{H}^+])$, which represents the difference between the given $\\mathrm{TA}$ and the TA calculated from the chemical species' concentrations:\n    $$\n    f([\\text{H}^+]) = \\mathrm{TA}_{\\text{given}} - \\mathrm{TA}_{\\text{calculated}}([\\text{H}^+]) = 0\n    $$\n    The calculated alkalinity, $\\mathrm{TA}_{\\text{calculated}}$, is defined as:\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{TA}_{\\text{calculated}} = [\\text{HCO}_3^-] + 2[\\text{CO}_3^{2-}] + [\\text{B(OH)}_4^-] + [\\text{OH}^-] - [\\text{H}^+]\n    $$\n    Each concentration term in this expression is a function of $[\\text{H}^+]$ and the previously computed constants:\n    -   The carbonate species ($[\\text{HCO}_3^-]$, $[\\text{CO}_3^{2-}]$) are expressed in terms of $\\mathrm{DIC}$, $[\\text{H}^+]$, $K_1$, and $K_2$. To improve numerical stability, the expressions are rearranged as:\n        $$[\\text{HCO}_3^-] = \\mathrm{DIC} \\frac{K_1 [\\text{H}^+]}{[\\text{H}^+]^2 + K_1 [\\text{H}^+] + K_1 K_2}$$\n        $$[\\text{CO}_3^{2-}] = \\mathrm{DIC} \\frac{K_1 K_2}{[\\text{H}^+]^2 + K_1 [\\text{H}^+] + K_1 K_2}$$\n    -   The borate species is given by: $[\\text{B(OH)}_4^-] = B_T \\frac{K_B}{K_B + [\\text{H}^+]}$\n    -   The hydroxide concentration is: $[\\text{OH}^-] = K_W / [\\text{H}^+]$\n\n4.  **Numerical Solution for $[\\text{H}^+]$**: The nonlinear equation $f([\\text{H}^+]) = 0$ is solved using a numerical root-finding algorithm. Brent's method (`scipy.optimize.brentq`) is an excellent choice as it is robust and efficient, provided a bracketing interval where the function changes sign. For the oceanic carbonate system, the function $f([\\text{H}^+])$ is monotonic. A suitable search interval for $[\\text{H}^+]$ is from $10^{-9}$ to $10^{-6}$ $\\text{mol/kg}$, which corresponds to a $pH$ range of $9$ to $6$, safely bracketing all plausible oceanic conditions.\n\n5.  **Calculation of Final Quantities**: Upon finding the unique solution for the hydrogen ion concentration, $[\\text{H}^+]_{sol}$:\n    -   The $pH$ is computed using its definition: $pH = -\\log_{10}([\\text{H}^+]_{sol})$.\n    -   The concentration of aqueous carbon dioxide, $[\\text{CO}_2]$, is calculated using the determined $[\\text{H}^+]_{sol}$:\n        $$[\\text{CO}_2] = \\mathrm{DIC} \\frac{[\\text{H}^+]_{sol}^2}{[\\text{H}^+]_{sol}^2 + K_1 [\\text{H}^+]_{sol} + K_1 K_2}$$\n    -   The partial pressure of $\\text{CO}_2$ is then found from Henry's Law: $p\\text{CO}_2 = [\\text{CO}_2] / K_0$. The result, initially in atmospheres, is converted to microatmospheres by multiplying by $10^6$.\n\n6.  **Output Formatting**: The final computed values of $pH$ and $p\\text{CO}_2$ for each test case are rounded to four and one decimal places, respectively, and formatted into the specified list structure. This process is iterated over all provided test cases to generate the complete final output.",

            "problem": "A large temperate river drains a mixed carbonate–silicate watershed and delivers dissolved ions to the coastal ocean, thereby modulating seawater buffering capacity through changes in total alkalinity (TA). Starting from conservation of mass and charge and using only stoichiometric weathering reactions, derive expressions for the contribution of carbonate weathering and silicate weathering to riverine TA under carbonic-acid–driven reactions, and show how strong-acid anions reduce the net TA exported to the ocean. Then use the derivation to estimate the basin-scale annual TA flux from the following flow-weighted mean data.\n\nAssumptions and foundational bases:\n- Total alkalinity (TA) is defined as the excess of proton acceptors over proton donors in water, and at circumneutral pH the dominant contributors are carbonate system bases produced by weathering.\n- Electroneutrality must hold and stoichiometric coefficients balance mass and charge in weathering reactions.\n- Carbonate weathering by carbonic acid produces divalent cations and bicarbonate; silicate weathering by carbonic acid produces monovalent or divalent cations, bicarbonate, and dissolved silica; weathering by strong acids such as sulfuric acid produces strong-acid anions that do not generate TA.\n- Activity coefficients are approximated as unity at these ionic strengths; contributions from borate, phosphate, and organic acids to TA are negligible at the stated pH.\n\nUse the canonical carbonic-acid weathering reactions as your starting point to establish how many equivalents of total alkalinity are generated per mole of cation released for carbonate versus silicate sources, and use electroneutrality to relate the net TA to dissolved ion charges.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in established principles of geochemistry, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively stated. The tasks require a logical derivation from foundational principles followed by a quantitative application, which is a standard and non-trivial exercise in environmental science.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of Total Alkalinity (TA) Generation\n\nTotal alkalinity (TA) in natural waters at circumneutral pH is approximated by the concentration of bicarbonate, as other contributors are negligible under the problem's stated assumptions: $TA \\approx [\\text{HCO}_3^{-}]$. The unit for TA is typically equivalents per liter, so we consider the charge contribution.\n\n**Carbonate Weathering by Carbonic Acid:**\nThe weathering of a generic carbonate mineral, such as calcite ($\\text{CaCO}_3$), by carbonic acid ($\\text{H}_2\\text{CO}_3$) is:\n$$ \\text{CaCO}_3(s) + \\text{H}_2\\text{CO}_3(aq) \\rightarrow \\text{Ca}^{2+}(aq) + 2\\text{HCO}_3^{-}(aq) $$\nFrom this stoichiometry, the dissolution of $1$ mole of $\\text{CaCO}_3$ produces $1$ mole of $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ and $2$ moles of $\\text{HCO}_3^{-}$. The increase in total alkalinity is $\\Delta TA = 2 \\Delta[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]$. Since the charge of the cation is $z=+2$, this reaction produces $2$ equivalents of alkalinity for every $2$ equivalents of cation charge released. Thus, for carbonate weathering, $1$ equivalent of cation charge released corresponds to the generation of $1$ equivalent of TA.\n\n**Silicate Weathering by Carbonic Acid:**\nThe weathering of silicate minerals also consumes carbonic acid and produces cations and bicarbonate.\nFor a silicate with a monovalent cation, like albite ($\\text{NaAlSi}_3\\text{O}_8$):\n$$ 2\\text{NaAlSi}_3\\text{O}_8(s) + 2\\text{H}_2\\text{CO}_3(aq) + 9\\text{H}_2\\text{O}(l) \\rightarrow 2\\text{Na}^{+}(aq) + 2\\text{HCO}_3^{-}(aq) + \\text{Al}_2\\text{Si}_2\\text{O}_5(\\text{OH})_4(s) + 4\\text{H}_4\\text{SiO}_4(aq) $$\nHere, $2$ moles of $\\text{Na}^{+}$ are released for every $2$ moles of $\\text{HCO}_3^{-}$ produced. The TA generation is $\\Delta TA = \\Delta[\\text{Na}^{+}]$. Since the charge is $z=+1$, $1$ equivalent of cation charge released corresponds to $1$ equivalent of TA.\n\nFor a silicate with a divalent cation, like anorthite ($\\text{CaAl}_2\\text{Si}_2\\text{O}_8$):\n$$ \\text{CaAl}_2\\text{Si}_2\\text{O}_8(s) + 2\\text{H}_2\\text{CO}_3(aq) + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}(l) \\rightarrow \\text{Ca}^{2+}(aq) + 2\\text{HCO}_3^{-}(aq) + \\text{Al}_2\\text{Si}_2\\text{O}_5(\\text{OH})_4(s) $$\nHere, $1$ mole of $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ is released for every $2$ moles of $\\text{HCO}_3^{-}$ produced. The TA generation is $\\Delta TA = 2 \\Delta[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]$. As with carbonate weathering, $2$ equivalents of cation charge correspond to $2$ equivalents of TA.\n\nIn all cases of carbonic acid-driven weathering, the gross amount of alkalinity produced ($TA_{gross}$), in charge equivalents, is equal to the sum of the charge of the base cations released from the minerals.\n$$ TA_{gross} = \\sum z_i [C_i] = 2[\\text{Ca}^{2+}] + 2[\\text{Mg}^{2+}] + [\\text{Na}^{+}] + [\\text{K}^{+}] $$\n\n**Weathering by Strong Acids:**\nWhen a strong acid, such as sulfuric acid ($\\text{H}_2\\text{SO}_4$), weathers a mineral, no net alkalinity is generated. For example, with calcite:\n$$ \\text{CaCO}_3(s) + \\text{H}_2\\text{SO}_4(aq) \\rightarrow \\text{Ca}^{2+}(aq) + \\text{SO}_4^{2-}(aq) + \\text{H}_2\\text{CO}_3(aq) $$\nThe cation $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ is released, but it is accompanied by a strong-acid anion ($\\text{SO}_4^{2-}$) instead of bicarbonate. The strong-acid anion does not contribute to alkalinity. Thus, cations liberated by strong acid weathering do not contribute to the net TA flux.\n\n**Electroneutrality Derivation of Net TA:**\nThe principle of electroneutrality requires that the sum of positive charges equals the sum of negative charges in the solution. For the major ions in the river:\n$$ (2[\\text{Ca}^{2+}] + 2[\\text{Mg}^{2+}] + [\\text{Na}^{+}] + [\\text{K}^{+}]) + [\\text{H}^{+}] = ([\\text{HCO}_3^{-}] + 2[\\text{CO}_3^{2-}]) + ([\\text{Cl}^{-}] + 2[\\text{SO}_4^{2-}] + [\\text{NO}_3^{-}]) + [\\text{OH}^{-}] $$\nDefining total alkalinity as $TA = [\\text{HCO}_3^{-}] + 2[\\text{CO}_3^{2-}] + [\\text{OH}^{-}] - [\\text{H}^{+}]$, we can rearrange the charge balance equation to solve for $TA$:\n$$ TA = (2[\\text{Ca}^{2+}] + 2[\\text{Mg}^{2+}] + [\\text{Na}^{+}] + [\\text{K}^{+}]) - ([\\text{Cl}^{-}] + 2[\\text{SO}_4^{2-}] + [\\text{NO}_3^{-}]) $$\nThis equation shows that the net total alkalinity ($TA_{net}$) is the gross alkalinity generated from weathering (the positive cation charge term) minus the charge contribution from strong-acid anions (the negative term), which represents the alkalinity \"consumed\" by strong acids.\n\n### Part 2: Calculation of Net TA Concentration\n\nFirst, we calculate the gross alkalinity generation, $TA_{gross}$, which is the total charge from base cations. Concentrations are given in $\\text{mmol L}^{-1}$, so the result will be in milliequivalents per liter ($\\text{meq L}^{-1}$).\n$$ TA_{gross} = 2[\\text{Ca}^{2+}] + 2[\\text{Mg}^{2+}] + [\\text{Na}^{+}] + [\\text{K}^{+}] $$\n$$ TA_{gross} = 2(0.90\\ \\text{mmol L}^{-1}) + 2(0.45\\ \\text{mmol L}^{-1}) + (0.70\\ \\text{mmol L}^{-1}) + (0.12\\ \\text{mmol L}^{-1}) $$\n$$ TA_{gross} = 1.80 + 0.90 + 0.70 + 0.12 = 3.52\\ \\text{meq L}^{-1} $$\nNow, we apportion this gross TA generation between carbonate and silicate sources.\nThe total concentration of divalent cations is $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}] + [\\text{Mg}^{2+}] = 0.90 + 0.45 = 1.35\\ \\text{mmol L}^{-1}$.\nTheir total charge contribution is $2 \\times 1.35 = 2.70\\ \\text{meq L}^{-1}$.\nThe fraction from carbonate weathering is $f_{\\mathrm{carb}} = 0.60$.\nThe TA generated from carbonate weathering, $TA_{carb}$, is the charge from the carbonate-derived fraction of divalent cations:\n$$ TA_{carb} = f_{\\mathrm{carb}} \\times (2([\\text{Ca}^{2+}] + [\\text{Mg}^{2+}])) = 0.60 \\times 2.70\\ \\text{meq L}^{-1} = 1.62\\ \\text{meq L}^{-1} $$\nThe TA generated from silicate weathering, $TA_{sil}$, is the sum of TA from silicate-derived divalent cations and all monovalent cations:\n$$ TA_{sil} = (1 - f_{\\mathrm{carb}}) \\times (2([\\text{Ca}^{2+}] + [\\text{Mg}^{2+}])) + ([\\text{Na}^{+}] + [\\text{K}^{+}]) $$\n$$ TA_{sil} = (1 - 0.60) \\times 2.70\\ \\text{meq L}^{-1} + (0.70 + 0.12)\\ \\text{meq L}^{-1} $$\n$$ TA_{sil} = 0.40 \\times 2.70 + 0.82 = 1.08 + 0.82 = 1.90\\ \\text{meq L}^{-1} $$\nThe sum $TA_{carb} + TA_{sil} = 1.62 + 1.90 = 3.52\\ \\text{meq L}^{-1}$, which matches $TA_{gross}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the charge from strong-acid anions, $[SAA]$:\n$$ [SAA] = [\\text{Cl}^{-}] + 2[\\text{SO}_{4}^{2-}] + [\\text{NO}_{3}^{-}] $$\n$$ [SAA] = 0.65\\ \\text{mmol L}^{-1} + 2(0.35\\ \\text{mmol L}^{-1}) + 0.04\\ \\text{mmol L}^{-1} $$\n$$ [SAA] = 0.65 + 0.70 + 0.04 = 1.39\\ \\text{meq L}^{-1} $$\nFinally, we compute the net TA concentration delivered to the ocean:\n$$ TA_{net} = TA_{gross} - [SAA] $$\n$$ TA_{net} = 3.52\\ \\text{meq L}^{-1} - 1.39\\ \\text{meq L}^{-1} = 2.13\\ \\text{meq L}^{-1} $$\n\n### Part 3: Computation of the Annual TA Flux\n\nThe annual flux is the product of the net TA concentration and the annual water discharge. We must ensure units are consistent.\nThe net TA concentration is $TA_{net} = 2.13\\ \\text{meq L}^{-1}$. Since TA is measured in equivalents, this is $2.13$ millimoles of charge equivalents per liter. We can write this as $2.13 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{mol L}^{-1}$.\nWe convert this to moles per cubic meter ($\\text{mol m}^{-3}$):\n$$ TA_{net} = 2.13 \\times 10^{-3} \\frac{\\text{mol}}{\\text{L}} \\times \\frac{1000\\ \\text{L}}{1\\ \\text{m}^{3}} = 2.13\\ \\text{mol m}^{-3} $$\nThe mean discharge is $Q = 3000\\ \\text{m}^{3} \\text{s}^{-1}$.\nThe instantaneous flux in moles per second is:\n$$ \\text{Flux}_{\\mathrm{s}} = TA_{net} \\times Q = 2.13\\ \\text{mol m}^{-3} \\times 3000\\ \\text{m}^{3} \\text{s}^{-1} = 6390\\ \\text{mol s}^{-1} $$\nTo find the annual flux, we use the conversion factor for seconds in a year: $1\\ \\text{year} = 3.1536 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\text{s}$.\n$$ \\text{Flux}_{\\mathrm{yr}} = 6390\\ \\frac{\\text{mol}}{\\text{s}} \\times 3.1536 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\frac{\\text{s}}{\\text{yr}} \\approx 2.0151 \\times 10^{11}\\ \\text{mol yr}^{-1} $$\nThe question requires the answer in teramoles per year ($\\text{Tmol yr}^{-1}$), where $1\\ \\text{Tmol} = 10^{12}\\ \\text{mol}$.\n$$ \\text{Flux}_{\\mathrm{Tmol}} = \\frac{2.0151 \\times 10^{11}\\ \\text{mol yr}^{-1}}{10^{12}\\ \\text{mol Tmol}^{-1}} \\approx 0.20151\\ \\text{Tmol yr}^{-1} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the annual TA flux is $0.202\\ \\text{Tmol yr}^{-1}$.",

            "problem": "Consider aqueous carbon dioxide hydration relevant to ocean acidification modeling. The elementary reaction is the reversible hydration of dissolved carbon dioxide to carbonic acid, written as $\\text{CO}_2(\\text{aq}) + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{H}_2\\text{CO}_3$. Assuming water activity is effectively constant, the reaction can be modeled by pseudo-first-order kinetics with forward rate constant $k_f$ and reverse rate constant $k_r$, each with units of $\\text{s}^{-1}$. Let $C(t)$ denote the concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide in $\\text{mol kg}^{-1}$ and $H(t)$ denote the concentration of carbonic acid in $\\text{mol kg}^{-1}$.

            "solution": "The problem is evaluated as valid, as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. The following is a complete derivation and solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is to model the time evolution of the concentration of carbonic acid, $H(t)$, in a closed aqueous system governed by the reversible pseudo-first-order reaction $\\text{CO}_2(\\text{aq}) + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{H}_2\\text{CO}_3$.\n\nFirst, we formulate the governing ordinary differential equation for $H(t)$. The rate of change of $H(t)$ is the rate of its formation from $\\text{CO}_2(\\text{aq})$ minus the rate of its decomposition back to $\\text{CO}_2(\\text{aq})$. According to the Law of Mass Action for the given pseudo-first-order kinetics, this is expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{dH(t)}{dt} = k_f C(t) - k_r H(t)\n$$\nwhere $C(t)$ is the concentration of aqueous $\\text{CO}_2$, $k_f$ is the forward rate constant, and $k_r$ is the reverse rate constant.\n\nThe problem states that the total hydrated carbon, $C_t = C(t) + H(t)$, is conserved. We can use this conservation law to eliminate $C(t)$ from the rate equation:\n$$\nC(t) = C_t - H(t)\n$$\nSubstituting this expression into the rate equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dH}{dt} = k_f (C_t - H(t)) - k_r H(t)\n$$\nExpanding and collecting terms involving $H(t)$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\frac{dH}{dt} = k_f C_t - (k_f + k_r) H(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear inhomogeneous ordinary differential equation. We can rearrange it into the standard form $\\frac{dy}{dt} + P(t)y = Q(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dH}{dt} + (k_f + k_r)H = k_f C_t\n$$\nThis equation can be solved using an integrating factor, $I(t) = e^{\\int (k_f + k_r) dt} = e^{(k_f + k_r)t}$. Multiplying the ODE by $I(t)$ yields:\n$$\ne^{(k_f + k_r)t} \\frac{dH}{dt} + (k_f + k_r)e^{(k_f + k_r)t} H = k_f C_t e^{(k_f + k_r)t}\n$$\nThe left-hand side is the derivative of the product $H(t)e^{(k_f + k_r)t}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( H(t) e^{(k_f + k_r)t} \\right) = k_f C_t e^{(k_f + k_r)t}\n$$\nIntegrating both sides with respect to time $t$:\n$$\nH(t) e^{(k_f + k_r)t} = \\int k_f C_t e^{(k_f + k_r)t} dt = \\frac{k_f C_t}{k_f + k_r} e^{(k_f + k_r)t} + A\n$$\nwhere $A$ is the constant of integration. Solving for $H(t)$ by dividing by $e^{(k_f + k_r)t}$:\n$$\nH(t) = \\frac{k_f C_t}{k_f + k_r} + A e^{-(k_f + k_r)t}\n$$\nThe integration constant $A$ is determined by the initial condition $H(0) = H_0$:\n$$\nH_0 = \\frac{k_f C_t}{k_f + k_r} + A e^0 \\implies A = H_0 - \\frac{k_f C_t}{k_f + k_r}\n$$\nSubstituting $A$ back into the general solution gives the specific solution for the kinetic model, which we denote as $H_{\\mathrm{kin}}(t)$:\n$$\nH_{\\mathrm{kin}}(t) = \\frac{k_f C_t}{k_f + k_r} + \\left(H_0 - \\frac{k_f C_t}{k_f + k_r}\\right)e^{-(k_f + k_r)t}\n$$\nNext, we determine the equilibrium concentration, $H_{\\mathrm{eq}}$. At equilibrium, the net rate of reaction is zero, $\\frac{dH}{dt} = 0$. From the ODE:\n$$\n0 = k_f C_t - (k_f + k_r) H_{\\mathrm{eq}}\n$$\nSolving for $H_{\\mathrm{eq}}$:\n$$\nH_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{k_f C_t}{k_f + k_r}\n$$\nThis equilibrium value is the concentration that $H(t)$ approaches as $t \\to \\infty$. By recognizing this term in our solution for $H_{\\mathrm{kin}}(t)$, we can rewrite the relaxation expression more compactly:\n$$\nH_{\\mathrm{kin}}(t) = H_{\\mathrm{eq}} + (H_0 - H_{\\mathrm{eq}})e^{-(k_f + k_r)t}\n$$\nThis expression clearly shows the concentration relaxing from its initial value $H_0$ to its final equilibrium value $H_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ with a characteristic relaxation time $\\tau = 1/(k_f + k_r)$.\n\nFinally, we derive the expression for the dimensionless relative deviation, $\\varepsilon(t)$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(t) = \\frac{H_{\\mathrm{kin}}(t) - H_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{H_{\\mathrm{eq}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived relaxation expression for $H_{\\mathrm{kin}}(t)$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(t) = \\frac{\\left(H_{\\mathrm{eq}} + (H_0 - H_{\\mathrm{eq}})e^{-(k_f + k_r)t}\\right) - H_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{H_{\\mathrm{eq}}}\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon(t) = \\frac{(H_0 - H_{\\mathrm{eq}})e^{-(k_f + k_r)t}}{H_{\\mathrm{eq}}} = \\left(\\frac{H_0}{H_{\\mathrm{eq}}} - 1\\right)e^{-(k_f + k_r)t}\n$$\nSubstituting the formula for $H_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ into the pre-factor gives an equivalent form that can be useful for implementation:\n$$\n\\frac{H_0}{H_{\\mathrm{eq}}} - 1 = \\frac{H_0}{\\frac{k_f C_t}{k_f + k_r}} - 1 = \\frac{H_0(k_f+k_r)}{k_f C_t} - 1\n$$\nSo, the final analytical expression to implement is:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(t) = \\left(\\frac{H_0(k_f+k_r)}{k_f C_t} - 1\\right)e^{-(k_f + k_r)t}\n$$\nThis expression will be used to compute the required values for each test case.",
