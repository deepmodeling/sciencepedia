This first exercise establishes this fundamental concept by treating the path from the atmosphere to a surface sink as an electrical circuit, where different processes present resistances to the pollutant's transport. By calculating the total deposition velocity from given component resistances, you will gain a practical understanding of how aerodynamic, boundary-layer, and surface processes collectively govern the deposition rate and learn to identify the rate-limiting step in the overall process .",

            "problem": "An air parcel containing ozone is transported over a horizontally homogeneous vegetated surface under steady-state, daytime, convectively unstable conditions. Assume there is no chemical production or loss of ozone within the surface layer, so that the vertical turbulent flux is constant with height. Let the ozone concentration at a reference height be $C_{r}$, and denote the constant downward flux by $F$ (positive downward). Under the big-leaf representation, three exchange pathways act in series between the reference height and the ultimate sinks within the surface: an aerodynamic pathway across the turbulent surface layer, a quasi-laminar sublayer adjacent to the surface, and a surface uptake pathway representing canopy and ground sinks. For each pathway, define a resistance as the ratio of the concentration drop across that pathway to the flux through it, namely $r_{a}$ for the aerodynamic pathway, $r_{b}$ for the quasi-laminar pathway, and $r_{c}$ for the surface uptake pathway, with units of $\\mathrm{s\\,m^{-1}}$. The deposition velocity $V_{d}$ is defined by the flux–concentration relationship $F = V_{d}\\,C_{r}$. Using steady-state conservation of mass and the above resistance definitions, derive an expression for $V_{d}$ in terms of $r_{a}$, $r_{b}$, and $r_{c}$, and then evaluate it for ozone with $r_{a}=30\\,\\mathrm{s\\,m^{-1}}$, $r_{b}=10\\,\\mathrm{s\\,m^{-1}}$, and $r_{c}=100\\,\\mathrm{s\\,m^{-1}}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and evaluation of the deposition velocity, $V_d$, for ozone using a resistance-in-series model. The model conceptualizes the deposition process as a sequence of transport and uptake pathways, each with an associated resistance. The total resistance to deposition is the sum of the individual resistances for pathways arranged in series, analogous to electrical resistors.\n\nLet $C_r$ be the ozone concentration at a reference height. Let $C_s$ be the ozone concentration at the interface between the turbulent surface layer and the quasi-laminar sublayer. Let $C_0$ be the ozone concentration at the effective surface, just before uptake. The ultimate sink for ozone is within the surface elements (e.g., stomata, soil), where the concentration is assumed to be zero. The downward flux, $F$, is constant throughout the layers under the stated steady-state assumption.\n\nThe definition of resistance for each pathway is the ratio of the concentration drop across that pathway to the flux. We can write this for the three pathways in series:\n$1$. The aerodynamic resistance, $r_a$, for the turbulent surface layer:\n$$F = \\frac{C_r - C_s}{r_a}$$\nThis implies the concentration drop across this layer is $\\Delta C_a = C_r - C_s = F r_a$.\n\n$2$. The quasi-laminar sublayer resistance, $r_b$:\n$$F = \\frac{C_s - C_0}{r_b}$$\nThis implies the concentration drop across this layer is $\\Delta C_b = C_s - C_0 = F r_b$.\n\n$3$. The surface uptake resistance, $r_c$, which accounts for all canopy and ground sink processes:\n$$F = \\frac{C_0 - 0}{r_c} = \\frac{C_0}{r_c}$$\nThis implies the concentration drop across the surface interface is $\\Delta C_c = C_0 = F r_c$.\n\nThe total concentration drop from the reference height to the ultimate sink (where concentration is zero) is $C_r - 0 = C_r$. Since the pathways are in series, this total drop is the sum of the individual concentration drops:\n$$C_r = (C_r - C_s) + (C_s - C_0) + C_0$$\nSubstituting the expressions in terms of flux and resistance:\n$$C_r = F r_a + F r_b + F r_c$$\nFactoring out the constant flux $F$:\n$$C_r = F (r_a + r_b + r_c)$$\nThe problem defines the deposition velocity, $V_d$, through the relationship $F = V_d C_r$. We can substitute this definition into the equation above:\n$$C_r = (V_d C_r) (r_a + r_b + r_c)$$\nAssuming the concentration $C_r$ is non-zero, we can divide both sides by $C_r$ to solve for $V_d$:\n$$V_d = \\frac{1}{r_a + r_b + r_c}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the deposition velocity in terms of the three resistances.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression using the given numerical values: $r_a = 30\\,\\mathrm{s\\,m^{-1}}$, $r_b = 10\\,\\mathrm{s\\,m^{-1}}$, and $r_c = 100\\,\\mathrm{s\\,m^{-1}}$.\nThe total resistance, $R_{\\text{tot}}$, is the sum of the individual resistances:\n$$R_{\\text{tot}} = r_a + r_b + r_c = 30\\,\\mathrm{s\\,m^{-1}} + 10\\,\\mathrm{s\\,m^{-1}} + 100\\,\\mathrm{s\\,m^{-1}} = 140\\,\\mathrm{s\\,m^{-1}}$$\nThe deposition velocity is the reciprocal of the total resistance:\n$$V_d = \\frac{1}{140}\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$$\nTo evaluate this numerically and express it in the required units of $\\mathrm{mm\\,s^{-1}}$, we perform the calculation and conversion. Knowing that $1\\,\\mathrm{m} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{mm}$:\n$$V_d = \\left(\\frac{1}{140}\\right) \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}} \\times \\frac{1000\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{1\\,\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{1000}{140}\\,\\mathrm{mm\\,s^{-1}} = \\frac{100}{14}\\,\\mathrm{mm\\,s^{-1}} = \\frac{50}{7}\\,\\mathrm{mm\\,s^{-1}}$$\nAs a decimal, this is approximately $7.142857...\\,\\mathrm{mm\\,s^{-1}}$. Rounding to three significant figures gives:\n$$V_d \\approx 7.14\\,\\mathrm{mm\\,s^{-1}}$$\n\nFinally, we must identify which resistance controls the magnitude of $V_d$. The deposition velocity $V_d$ is inversely proportional to the total resistance, $R_{\\text{tot}} = r_a + r_b + r_c$. The magnitude of $V_d$ is therefore limited by the magnitude of $R_{\\text{tot}}$. The term in the sum that has the largest value will contribute most to the total and thus act as the primary bottleneck or \"controlling resistance\" for the overall process.\nGiven the values $r_a=30\\,\\mathrm{s\\,m^{-1}}$, $r_b=10\\,\\mathrm{s\\,m^{-1}}$, and $r_c=100\\,\\mathrm{s\\,m^{-1}}$, the surface uptake resistance $r_c$ is by far the largest component. It constitutes $100/140 \\approx 71.4\\%$ of the total resistance. Therefore, the surface uptake resistance, $r_c$, controls the magnitude of the deposition velocity $V_d$. The convectively unstable conditions promote strong turbulent mixing, which leads to a comparatively small aerodynamic resistance $r_a$, further emphasizing the controlling role of the surface processes encapsulated by $r_c$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the canopy surface resistance $r_c$ and the dry deposition velocity $V_d$ for ozone, based on a resistance-network model for a deciduous forest. The solution proceeds by first converting the leaf-scale conductances from water vapor to ozone, then upscaling to the canopy level, converting units, and finally combining resistances to find the deposition velocity.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the conductance of a gas and its molecular diffusivity. For a transport process limited by molecular diffusion through a fixed geometry (such as stomatal pores), the molar conductance, $g$, is directly proportional to the molecular diffusivity, $D$, of the gas. The provided leaf-scale conductances for water vapor, $g_{s,w}$ (stomatal) and $g_{cu,w}$ (cuticular), can be converted to their equivalents for ozone, $g_{s, \\mathrm{O_3}}$ and $g_{cu, \\mathrm{O_3}}$, using the ratio of their molecular diffusivities, $D_{\\mathrm{O_3}}$ and $D_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}$.\n\nThe ratio of the diffusivities is:\n$$\n\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{O_3}}}{D_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}} = \\frac{1.50 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{2} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{2.50 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{2} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 0.6\n$$\nUsing this ratio, we convert the molar conductances:\nThe stomatal conductance for ozone is:\n$$\ng_{s, \\mathrm{O_3}} = g_{s,w} \\times \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{O_3}}}{D_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}} = (0.25 \\ \\mathrm{mol} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times 0.6 = 0.15 \\ \\mathrm{mol} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe cuticular conductance for ozone is:\n$$\ng_{cu, \\mathrm{O_3}} = g_{cu,w} \\times \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{O_3}}}{D_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}} = (0.010 \\ \\mathrm{mol} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times 0.6 = 0.006 \\ \\mathrm{mol} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThese conductances are per unit of one-sided leaf area.\n\nNext, we determine the total leaf-scale conductance for ozone. The stomatal and cuticular pathways are parallel sinks for ozone at the leaf surface.

This is achieved by multiplying the leaf-scale conductance by the Leaf Area Index, $L=5.0$. This gives the total canopy conductance in molar units, $G_{c,m}$, per unit ground area:\n$$\nG_{c,m} = g_{leaf, \\mathrm{O_3}} \\times L = (0.156 \\ \\mathrm{mol} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times 5.0 = 0.78 \\ \\mathrm{mol} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires resistances in velocity units ($\\mathrm{s} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}$), so we must convert the molar conductance $G_{c,m}$ (which relates molar flux to a mole fraction gradient) into a conductance in velocity units, $G_{c,v}$ (which relates molar flux to a molar concentration gradient). The relationship is $G_{c,v} = G_{c,m} / C_{air}$, where $C_{air}$ is the molar density of air. Using the ideal gas law, $P = C_{air}RT$, we find $C_{air} = P/(RT)$. The provided constants are the air pressure $P = 1.013 \\times 10^{5} \\ \\mathrm{Pa}$, the air temperature $T = 298 \\ \\mathrm{K}$, and the universal gas constant $R = 8.314 \\ \\mathrm{J} \\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1} \\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.\n\nThe canopy resistance, $r_c$, is the reciprocal of the canopy conductance in velocity units ($r_c = 1/G_{c,v}$).

The dry deposition flux for a reactive or nonreactive scalar at the surface is defined as the downward mass flux into the surface, which, under the classical deposition-velocity concept, is proportional to the mean concentration at a reference height $z_{r}$ in the surface layer. Specifically, dry deposition velocity $V_{d}$ is defined by\n$$\nF = V_{d}\\, C_{r},\n$$\nwhere $F$ is the downward mass flux at the surface and $C_{r}$ is the mean concentration at height $z_{r}$.
