            "solution": "The problem requires a bifurcation analysis of the one-dimensional dynamical system given by the ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\n\\dot{x} = \\mu - x + x^{3}\n$$\nThe state variable is $x$ and $\\mu$ is a control parameter. The analysis involves identifying the equilibrium points, determining their stability, and finding the critical values of $\\mu$ at which saddle-node bifurcations occur.\n\nLet the right-hand side of the ODE be denoted by the function $f(x, \\mu)$, such that $\\dot{x} = f(x, \\mu) = \\mu - x + x^{3}$.\n\n**Step 1: Equilibrium Points**\n\nEquilibrium points, denoted by $x^{\\ast}$, are the values of $x$ for which the system is stationary, i.e., $\\dot{x} = 0$. We find these by solving the equation $f(x^{\\ast}, \\mu) = 0$.\n$$\n\\mu - x^{\\ast} + (x^{\\ast})^{3} = 0\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to express $\\mu$ as a function of the equilibrium state $x^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n\\mu = x^{\\ast} - (x^{\\ast})^{3}\n$$\nThis cubic relationship shows that for a given value of $\\mu$, there can be either one or three real equilibrium points $x^{\\ast}$.\n\n**Step 2: Stability Analysis**\n\nThe local stability of an equilibrium point $x^{\\ast}$ in a one-dimensional system is determined by the sign of the derivative of $f(x, \\mu)$ with respect to $x$, evaluated at $x^{\\ast}$. Let's compute this derivative:\n$$\nf'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}f(x, \\mu) = \\frac{d}{dx}(\\mu - x + x^{3}) = -1 + 3x^{2}\n$$\nThe stability criteria are:\n- If $f'(x^{\\ast}) < 0$, the equilibrium is locally stable (an attractor).\n- If $f'(x^{\\ast}) > 0$, the equilibrium is locally unstable (a repellor).\n- If $f'(x^{\\ast}) = 0$, the equilibrium is marginally stable, and a bifurcation may occur.\n\nFrom the expression for $f'(x)$, we can determine the stability based on the value of $x^{\\ast}$:\n- Stability ($f'(x^{\\ast})<0$): $-1 + 3(x^{\\ast})^{2} < 0 \\implies 3(x^{\\ast})^{2} < 1 \\implies (x^{\\ast})^{2} < \\frac{1}{3}$. This corresponds to $-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} < x^{\\ast} < \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\n- Instability ($f'(x^{\\ast})>0$): $-1 + 3(x^{\\ast})^{2} > 0 \\implies (x^{\\ast})^{2} > \\frac{1}{3}$. This corresponds to $x^{\\ast} > \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$ or $x^{\\ast} < -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\n**Step 3: Saddle-Node Bifurcations**\n\nA saddle-node (or fold) bifurcation occurs when a pair of equilibria—one stable and one unstable—coalesce and annihilate. This happens at points where the equilibrium is marginally stable, i.e., $f'(x^{\\ast})=0$. To find the critical values of the parameter $\\mu$ at which these bifurcations occur, we must solve the system of two equations simultaneously: the equilibrium condition and the marginal stability condition.\n\nThe system of equations for the critical points $(x_c, \\mu_c)$ is:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\mu_c - x_c + x_c^3 = 0 & \\quad (\\text{Equilibrium condition: } f(x_c, \\mu_c) = 0) \\\\\n-1 + 3x_c^2 = 0 & \\quad (\\text{Marginal stability condition: } f'(x_c) = 0)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nFrom the second equation, we find the values of $x$ at which the bifurcations occur:\n$$\n3x_c^2 = 1 \\implies x_c^2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\implies x_c = \\pm\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\n$$\nThese are the two equilibrium points where the bifurcations happen. Now, we substitute these values of $x_c$ back into the first equation (or the rearranged equilibrium condition $\\mu_c = x_c - x_c^3$) to find the corresponding critical values of $\\mu$, denoted $\\mu_c$.\n\nCase 1: $x_c = +\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n$$\n\\mu_{c1} = x_c - x_c^3 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} - \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} - \\frac{1}{3\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{3 - 1}{3\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{2}{3\\sqrt{3}}\n$$\n\nCase 2: $x_c = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n$$\n\\mu_{c2} = x_c - x_c^3 = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} - \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^3 = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} - \\left(-\\frac{1}{3\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} + \\frac{1}{3\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{-3 + 1}{3\\sqrt{3}} = -\\frac{2}{3\\sqrt{3}}\n$$\n\nThe critical values of $\\mu$ at which saddle-node bifurcations occur are $\\mu_c = \\pm\\frac{2}{3\\sqrt{3}}$. These values can be written with a rationalized denominator as $\\mu_c = \\pm\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{9}$. For values of $\\mu$ between $-\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{9}$ and $\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{9}$, the system has three equilibria (two stable, one unstable). For $|\\mu| > \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{9}$, it has only one stable equilibrium. At the critical values $\\mu_c$, two of the equilibria merge.\n\nThe two critical values of $\\mu$ are $-\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{9}$ and $\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{9}$.",

Derive the symmetric Nash equilibrium effort for the decentralized scenario.\n3.  Derive the optimal effort for the centralized social planner scenario.\n4.  Compute the ratio of the aggregate efforts from the two scenarios.\n\nStep 1: Sustainable Biomass\nThe ecological dynamics are given by the logistic growth model with harvesting:\n$$ \\frac{dB}{dt} = rB\\left(1 - \\frac{B}{K}\\right) - qEB $$\nwhere $E$ is the aggregate harvest effort, $E = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E_i$. The system is assumed to be in a stationary regime, which implies that the biomass level is constant, i.e., $\\frac{dB}{dt} = 0$.\n$$ rB\\left(1 - \\frac{B}{K}\\right) - qEB = 0 $$\nThis equation has two possible steady-state solutions for $B$. One is the trivial solution $B=0$, which corresponds to the extinction of the resource. The other is the non-trivial, positive biomass level which we seek. We can find it by dividing by $B$ (assuming $B>0$):\n$$ r\\left(1 - \\frac{B}{K}\\right) - qE = 0 $$\nSolving for $B$ as a function of the aggregate effort $E$:\n$$ 1 - \\frac{B}{K} = \\frac{qE}{r} $$\n$$ \\frac{B}{K} = 1 - \\frac{qE}{r} $$\n$$ B(E) = K\\left(1 - \\frac{qE}{r}\\right) $$\nThis expression represents the sustainable biomass level for a given aggregate effort $E$. For a positive biomass, it is required that $E < \\frac{r}{q}$.\n\nStep 2: Symmetric Nash Equilibrium (Decentralized Outcome)\nIn the decentralized scenario, each of the $N$ identical agents chooses their effort $E_i$ to maximize their own individual utility, taking the efforts of the other agents, $E_{-i} = \\sum_{j \\neq i} E_j$, as given. The utility for agent $i$ is:\n$$ u_i(E_i, B) = p\\,q\\,E_i\\,B - c\\,E_i - \\phi\\,q\\,E_i\\,B = ((p - \\phi)qB - c)E_i $$\nEach agent recognizes that the sustainable biomass $B$ depends on the aggregate effort $E = E_i + E_{-i}$. Substituting the expression for $B(E)$ into the utility function, we get the utility for agent $i$ as a function of efforts only:\n$$ u_i(E_i, E_{-i}) = \\left((p - \\phi)qK\\left(1 - \\frac{q(E_i + E_{-i})}{r}\\right) - c\\right)E_i $$\nTo find the optimal effort $E_i$, we differentiate $u_i$ with respect to $E_i$ and set the derivative to zero.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial E_i} = (p - \\phi)qK\\left(1 - \\frac{q(E_i + E_{-i})}{r}\\right) - c + E_i\\left((p - \\phi)qK\\left(-\\frac{q}{r}\\right)\\right) = 0 $$\n$$ (p - \\phi)qK\\left(1 - \\frac{q(E_i + E_{-i})}{r} - \\frac{qE_i}{r}\\right) - c = 0 $$\n$$ (p - \\phi)qK\\left(1 - \\frac{q(2E_i + E_{-i})}{r}\\right) = c $$\nThis equation gives the reaction function of agent $i$. We are looking for a symmetric Nash equilibrium where all agents choose the same effort level, $E_i = E^*$ for all $i=1, \\dots, N$. In this case, $E_{-i} = (N-1)E^*$. Substituting this into the first-order condition:\n$$ (p - \\phi)qK\\left(1 - \\frac{q(2E^* + (N-1)E^*)}{r}\\right) = c $$\n$$ (p - \\phi)qK\\left(1 - \\frac{q(N+1)E^*}{r}\\right) = c $$\nNow, we solve for the symmetric equilibrium effort $E^*$:\n$$ 1 - \\frac{q(N+1)E^*}{r} = \\frac{c}{(p - \\phi)qK} $$\n$$ \\frac{q(N+1)E^*}{r} = 1 - \\frac{c}{(p - \\phi)qK} $$\n$$ E^* = \\frac{r}{q(N+1)}\\left(1 - \\frac{c}{(p - \\phi)qK}\\right) $$\nThe total effort in the decentralized Nash equilibrium is the sum of individual efforts:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{tot}}^{\\mathrm{Nash}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E^* = N E^* = \\frac{Nr}{q(N+1)}\\left(1 - \\frac{c}{(p - \\phi)qK}\\right) $$\n\nStep 3: Social Planner's Optimum (Centralized Outcome)\nThe social planner aims to maximize the aggregate net benefit of all agents, which is the sum of their utilities. Let $U_{SP}$ be the total social welfare.\n$$ U_{SP} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} u_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left(((p - \\phi)qB - c)E_i\\right) = ((p - \\phi)qB - c) \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E_i $$\nLet $E^{\\mathrm{SP}}$ be the total effort chosen by the social planner. Then $U_{SP}$ becomes:\n$$ U_{SP}(E^{\\mathrm{SP}}) = ((p - \\phi)qB - c)E^{\\mathrm{SP}} $$\nThe planner is also constrained by the ecological dynamics, so we substitute $B(E^{\\mathrm{SP}}) = K\\left(1 - \\frac{qE^{\\mathrm{SP}}}{r}\\right)$:\n$$ U_{SP}(E^{\\mathrm{SP}}) = \\left((p - \\phi)qK\\left(1 - \\frac{qE^{\\mathrm{SP}}}{r}\\right) - c\\right)E^{\\mathrm{SP}} $$\nTo find the optimal total effort $E^{\\mathrm{SP}}$, we differentiate $U_{SP}$ with respect to $E^{\\mathrm{SP}}$ and set the derivative to zero.\n$$ \\frac{d U_{SP}}{d E^{\\mathrm{SP}}} = (p - \\phi)qK\\left(1 - \\frac{qE^{\\mathrm{SP}}}{r}\\right) - c + E^{\\mathrm{SP}}\\left((p - \\phi)qK\\left(-\\frac{q}{r}\\right)\\right) = 0 $$\n$$ (p - \\phi)qK\\left(1 - \\frac{2qE^{\\mathrm{SP}}}{r}\\right) - c = 0 $$\nSolving for the socially optimal total effort, which we denote $E_{\\mathrm{tot}}^{\\mathrm{SP}} = E^{\\mathrm{SP}}$:\n$$ 1 - \\frac{2qE_{\\mathrm{tot}}^{\\mathrm{SP}}}{r} = \\frac{c}{(p - \\phi)qK} $$\n$$ \\frac{2qE_{\\mathrm{tot}}^{\\mathrm{SP}}}{r} = 1 - \\frac{c}{(p - \\phi)qK} $$\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{tot}}^{\\mathrm{SP}} = \\frac{r}{2q}\\left(1 - \\frac{c}{(p - \\phi)qK}\\right) $$\n\nStep 4: Ratio of Decentralized to Centralized Effort\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R$ of the total decentralized effort to the total centralized effort.\n$$ R = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{tot}}^{\\mathrm{Nash}}}{E_{\\mathrm{tot}}^{\\mathrm{SP}}} = \\frac{\\frac{Nr}{q(N+1)}\\left(1 - \\frac{c}{(p - \\phi)qK}\\right)}{\\frac{r}{2q}\\left(1 - \\frac{c}{(p - \\phi)qK}\\right)} $$\nThe condition $(p - \\phi)qK > c$ ensures that the term $\\left(1 - \\frac{c}{(p - \\phi)qK}\\right)$ is positive and thus non-zero, allowing it to be cancelled from the numerator and denominator.\n$$ R = \\frac{\\frac{Nr}{q(N+1)}}{\\frac{r}{2q}} = \\frac{Nr}{q(N+1)} \\cdot \\frac{2q}{r} $$\n$$ R = \\frac{2N}{N+1} $$\nThis expression gives the ratio as a function of the number of agents $N$ only, as required. This result quantifies the \"tragedy of the commons\" in this model: as $N$ increases, the ratio of decentralized to centralized effort approaches $2$, indicating significant over-exploitation of the resource.",

For an ODE of the form $\\frac{dC}{dt} = f(C)$, the scheme is:\n$$ C_{t+1} = C_t + \\Delta t \\, f(C_t) $$\nLet's define the discrete-time map $F(C)$ such that $C_{t+1} = F(C_t)$.\n$$ F(C) = C + \\Delta t \\, f(C) $$\nThe equilibria of the continuous system are fixed points of this map, since if $f(C^*) = 0$, then $F(C^*) = C^* + \\Delta t \\cdot 0 = C^*$. We are interested in the stability of the fixed point $C^*$.\n\nLocal asymptotic stability of a fixed point $C^*$ for a one-dimensional discrete map $C_{t+1} = F(C_t)$ is determined by the magnitude of the derivative of $F$ evaluated at $C^*$.
