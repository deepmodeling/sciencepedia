For tensor calculations, we map these coordinates to $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ and the velocity components to $(u_1, u_2, u_3)$. Thus, we have:\n$$ u_1 = \\gamma x_3 $$\n$$ u_2 = 0 $$\n$$ u_3 = 0 $$\nThe rate-of-deformation tensor, $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{ij}$, is defined as the symmetric part of the velocity gradient tensor $\\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x_j}$.

            "problem": "Consider a grounded glacier represented by a two-dimensional flowline along the horizontal coordinate $x \\in [0, L]$ with vertical coordinate $z$. Let the free surface be $S(x,t)$, the bed be $b(x)$, and the ice thickness be $H(x,t) = S(x,t) - b(x)$. Assume the glacier is laterally uniform with constant flowline width, so the problem reduces to one-dimensional depth-integration along $x$. The ice is incompressible, and the flow satisfies the kinematic boundary condition at the free surface. There is no basal melting or freezing, and the bed is fixed in time. The surface mass balance (net accumulation minus ablation) is prescribed as\n$$\na_{s}(x) = a_{0}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_{a}}\\right),\n$$\nwith constants $a_{0} > 0$ and $L_{a} > 0$.

Express your final answer as a single analytic expression in terms of $x$, $a_{0}$, $L_{a}$, $U_{0}$, and $L_{u}$. Express the thickness in meters. Do not substitute numerical values.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the one-dimensional depth-integrated mass continuity equation for a glacier, followed by the solution for the steady-state ice thickness profile $H(x)$ given specific forms for the surface mass balance $a_s(x)$ and the depth-averaged horizontal speed $U(x)$.\n\nFirst, we derive the mass continuity equation. The fundamental principle is the conservation of mass, which for an incompressible fluid like ice is expressed by the continuity equation in two dimensions $(x, z)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} = 0\n$$\nwhere $u$ is the horizontal velocity component and $w$ is the vertical velocity component. We integrate this equation over the full ice thickness, from the bed $z=b(x)$ to the free surface $z=S(x,t)$:\n$$\n\\int_{b(x)}^{S(x,t)} \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} \\right) dz = 0\n$$\nSeparating the integral into two parts:\n$$\n\\int_{b(x)}^{S(x,t)} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} dz + \\int_{b(x)}^{S(x,t)} \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} dz = 0\n$$\nThe second term is straightforward to integrate:\n$$\n\\int_{b(x)}^{S(x,t)} \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} dz = w(S) - w(b)\n$$\nwhere $w(S)$ and $w(b)$ are the vertical velocities at the surface and bed, respectively. To evaluate the first term, we use the Leibniz integral rule for differentiating an integral with variable limits:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\int_{b(x)}^{S(x,t)} u \\, dz = \\int_{b(x)}^{S(x,t)} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} dz + u(S)\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial x} - u(b)\\frac{db}{dx}\n$$\nRearranging this gives an expression for the first term:\n$$\n\\int_{b(x)}^{S(x,t)} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} dz = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\int_{b(x)}^{S(x,t)} u \\, dz - u(S)\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial x} + u(b)\\frac{db}{dx}\n$$\nSubstituting these results back into the integrated continuity equation yields:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\int_{b(x)}^{S(x,t)} u \\, dz - u(S)\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial x} + u(b)\\frac{db}{dx} \\right) + (w(S) - w(b)) = 0\n$$\nNow, we apply the kinematic boundary conditions.\nAt the free surface, $z=S(x,t)$, the rate of change of surface elevation is governed by the ice velocity components and the surface mass balance, $a_s(x)$. The standard kinematic surface condition is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial t} = w(S) - u(S)\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial x} + a_s(x)\n$$\nThis can be rearranged to express $w(S)$:\n$$\nw(S) = \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial t} + u(S)\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial x} - a_s(x)\n$$\nAt the bed, $z=b(x)$, which is assumed to be fixed, impermeable, and non-sliding, the ice flow must be parallel to the bed. This implies:\n$$\nw(b) = u(b)\\frac{db}{dx}\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions for $w(S)$ and $w(b)$ into our evolving equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\int_{b(x)}^{S(x,t)} u \\, dz - u(S)\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial x} + u(b)\\frac{db}{dx} + \\left( \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial t} + u(S)\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial x} - a_s(x) \\right) - \\left( u(b)\\frac{db}{dx} \\right) = 0\n$$\nSeveral terms cancel out, simplifying the equation significantly:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\int_{b(x)}^{S(x,t)} u \\, dz + \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial t} - a_s(x) = 0\n$$\nWe identify the depth-integrated flux per unit width as $q(x,t) = \\int_{b(x)}^{S(x,t)} u \\, dz$. Furthermore, the ice thickness is $H(x,t) = S(x,t) - b(x)$. Since the bed $b(x)$ is fixed in time, $\\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial t} = 0$, so $\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial t}$. Substituting these definitions, we arrive at the one-dimensional depth-integrated mass continuity equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial x} = a_s(x)\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we solve for the steady-state thickness profile, $H(x)$. Under steady-state conditions, all quantities are independent of time, so $\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial t}=0$. The continuity equation reduces to:\n$$\n\\frac{dq}{dx} = a_s(x)\n$$\nWe can find the flux $q(x)$ by integrating this ordinary differential equation with respect to $x$. We use a definite integral from the ice divide at $x=0$ to an arbitrary point $x$:\n$$\n\\int_0^x \\frac{dq}{dx'} dx' = \\int_0^x a_s(x') dx'\n$$\nThis gives $q(x) - q(0) = \\int_0^x a_s(x') dx'$. The problem states that the horizontal flux at the ice divide is zero, so $q(0)=0$. Therefore:\n$$\nq(x) = \\int_0^x a_s(x') dx'\n$$\nWe are given the surface mass balance $a_s(x) = a_{0}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_{a}}\\right)$. Substituting this and performing the integration:\n$$\nq(x) = \\int_0^x a_0\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x'}{L_{a}}\\right) dx' = a_0 \\left[ -L_a \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x'}{L_{a}}\\right) \\right]_0^x\n$$\n$$\nq(x) = a_0 \\left( -L_a \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_{a}}\\right) - \\left(-L_a \\exp(0)\\right) \\right) = a_0 L_a \\left( 1 - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_{a}}\\right) \\right)\n$$\nThe problem also provides the relation between flux, depth-averaged velocity $U(x)$, and thickness $H(x)$: $q(x) = U(x)H(x)$. Equating the two expressions for $q(x)$:\n$$\nU(x) H(x) = a_0 L_a \\left[ 1 - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_{a}}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nTo find $H(x)$, we isolate it by dividing by $U(x)$:\n$$\nH(x) = \\frac{a_0 L_a \\left[ 1 - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_{a}}\\right) \\right]}{U(x)}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute the given expression for the depth-averaged horizontal speed, $U(x) = U_{0}\\left[1 - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_{u}}\\right)\\right]$:\n$$\nH(x) = \\frac{a_0 L_a \\left[ 1 - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_{a}}\\right) \\right]}{U_{0}\\left[1 - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_{u}}\\right)\\right]}\n$$\nThis expression provides the steady-state ice thickness profile $H(x)$ for $x \\in (0, L]$ in terms of the given parameters. The units are consistent, resulting in a thickness in meters, provided $a_0$ is in meters per year, $U_0$ is in meters per year, and $L_a$, $L_u$, and $x$ are in meters.",

The grounding line is the location where the ice transitions from being grounded on the bed to floating in the ocean. At this precise location, the ice thickness is such that the ice column is in hydrostatic equilibrium with the adjacent ocean water, and the base of the ice is at the same elevation as the seafloor.\n\nLet $H_f(x)$ be the ice thickness required for flotation at a horizontal position $x$. Let $b(x)$ be the bed elevation relative to sea level, which is at $z=0$. By definition, $b(x)$ is negative for a bed below sea level. The pressure exerted by the ice column of thickness $H_f(x)$ at its base is the glaciostatic pressure, given by:\n$$P_{ice} = \\rho_i g H_f(x)$$\nwhere $\\rho_i$ is the density of ice and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nFor the ice to be floating, this pressure must be balanced by the hydrostatic pressure of the ocean water at the same depth. The depth of the ice base is the absolute value of its elevation, which is $-b(x)$. The hydrostatic water pressure at this depth is:\n$$P_{water} = \\rho_w g (-b(x))$$\nwhere $\\rho_w$ is the density of seawater.\n\nThe condition for flotation is $P_{ice} = P_{water}$.
