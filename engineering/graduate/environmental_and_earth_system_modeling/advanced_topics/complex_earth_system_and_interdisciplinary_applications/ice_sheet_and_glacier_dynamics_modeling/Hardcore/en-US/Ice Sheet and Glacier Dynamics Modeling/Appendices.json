            "problem": "Consider a grounded glacier represented by a two-dimensional flowline along the horizontal coordinate $x \\in [0, L]$ with vertical coordinate $z$. Let the free surface be $S(x,t)$, the bed be $b(x)$, and the ice thickness be $H(x,t) = S(x,t) - b(x)$. Assume the glacier is laterally uniform with constant flowline width, so the problem reduces to one-dimensional depth-integration along $x$. The ice is incompressible, and the flow satisfies the kinematic boundary condition at the free surface. There is no basal melting or freezing, and the bed is fixed in time. The surface mass balance (net accumulation minus ablation) is prescribed as\n$$\na_{s}(x) = a_{0}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_{a}}\\right),\n$$\nwith constants $a_{0} > 0$ and $L_{a} > 0$.

The depth-integrated flux per unit width is $q(x,t) = \\int_{b(x)}^{S(x,t)} u(x,z,t)\\,dz$, and by definition of $U(x)$ one has $q(x,t) = U(x)\\,H(x,t)$.

Express your final answer as a single analytic expression in terms of $x$, $a_{0}$, $L_{a}$, $U_{0}$, and $L_{u}$. Express the thickness in meters. Do not substitute numerical values. The final answer must be a single closed-form expression; no rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the one-dimensional depth-integrated mass continuity equation for a glacier, followed by the solution for the steady-state ice thickness profile $H(x)$ given specific forms for the surface mass balance $a_s(x)$ and the depth-averaged horizontal speed $U(x)$.\n\nFirst, we derive the mass continuity equation. The fundamental principle is the conservation of mass, which for an incompressible fluid like ice is expressed by the continuity equation in two dimensions $(x, z)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} = 0\n$$\nwhere $u$ is the horizontal velocity component and $w$ is the vertical velocity component. We integrate this equation over the full ice thickness, from the bed $z=b(x)$ to the free surface $z=S(x,t)$:\n$$\n\\int_{b(x)}^{S(x,t)} \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} \\right) dz = 0\n$$\nSeparating the integral into two parts:\n$$\n\\int_{b(x)}^{S(x,t)} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} dz + \\int_{b(x)}^{S(x,t)} \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} dz = 0\n$$\nThe second term is straightforward to integrate:\n$$\n\\int_{b(x)}^{S(x,t)} \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} dz = w(S) - w(b)\n$$\nwhere $w(S)$ and $w(b)$ are the vertical velocities at the surface and bed, respectively. To evaluate the first term, we use the Leibniz integral rule for differentiating an integral with variable limits:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\int_{b(x)}^{S(x,t)} u \\, dz = \\int_{b(x)}^{S(x,t)} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} dz + u(S)\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial x} - u(b)\\frac{db}{dx}\n$$\nRearranging this gives an expression for the first term:\n$$\n\\int_{b(x)}^{S(x,t)} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} dz = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\int_{b(x)}^{S(x,t)} u \\, dz - u(S)\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial x} + u(b)\\frac{db}{dx}\n$$\nSubstituting these results back into the integrated continuity equation yields:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\int_{b(x)}^{S(x,t)} u \\, dz - u(S)\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial x} + u(b)\\frac{db}{dx} \\right) + (w(S) - w(b)) = 0\n$$\nNow, we apply the kinematic boundary conditions.\nAt the free surface, $z=S(x,t)$, the rate of change of surface elevation is governed by the ice velocity components and the surface mass balance, $a_s(x)$. The standard kinematic surface condition is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial t} = w(S) - u(S)\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial x} + a_s(x)\n$$\nThis can be rearranged to express $w(S)$:\n$$\nw(S) = \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial t} + u(S)\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial x} - a_s(x)\n$$\nAt the bed, $z=b(x)$, which is assumed to be fixed, impermeable, and non-sliding, the ice flow must be parallel to the bed. This implies:\n$$\nw(b) = u(b)\\frac{db}{dx}\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions for $w(S)$ and $w(b)$ into our evolving equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\int_{b(x)}^{S(x,t)} u \\, dz - u(S)\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial x} + u(b)\\frac{db}{dx} + \\left( \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial t} + u(S)\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial x} - a_s(x) \\right) - \\left( u(b)\\frac{db}{dx} \\right) = 0\n$$\nSeveral terms cancel out, simplifying the equation significantly:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\int_{b(x)}^{S(x,t)} u \\, dz + \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial t} - a_s(x) = 0\n$$\nWe identify the depth-integrated flux per unit width as $q(x,t) = \\int_{b(x)}^{S(x,t)} u \\, dz$. Furthermore, the ice thickness is $H(x,t) = S(x,t) - b(x)$. Since the bed $b(x)$ is fixed in time, $\\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial t} = 0$, so $\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial t}$. Substituting these definitions, we arrive at the one-dimensional depth-integrated mass continuity equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial x} = a_s(x)\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we solve for the steady-state thickness profile, $H(x)$. Under steady-state conditions, all quantities are independent of time, so $\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial t}=0$. The continuity equation reduces to:\n$$\n\\frac{dq}{dx} = a_s(x)\n$$\nWe can find the flux $q(x)$ by integrating this ordinary differential equation with respect to $x$. We use a definite integral from the ice divide at $x=0$ to an arbitrary point $x$:\n$$\n\\int_0^x \\frac{dq}{dx'} dx' = \\int_0^x a_s(x') dx'\n$$\nThis gives $q(x) - q(0) = \\int_0^x a_s(x') dx'$. The problem states that the horizontal flux at the ice divide is zero, so $q(0)=0$. Therefore:\n$$\nq(x) = \\int_0^x a_s(x') dx'\n$$\nWe are given the surface mass balance $a_s(x) = a_{0}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_{a}}\\right)$. Substituting this and performing the integration:\n$$\nq(x) = \\int_0^x a_0\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x'}{L_{a}}\\right) dx' = a_0 \\left[ -L_a \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x'}{L_{a}}\\right) \\right]_0^x\n$$\n$$\nq(x) = a_0 \\left( -L_a \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_{a}}\\right) - \\left(-L_a \\exp(0)\\right) \\right) = a_0 L_a \\left( 1 - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_{a}}\\right) \\right)\n$$\nThe problem also provides the relation between flux, depth-averaged velocity $U(x)$, and thickness $H(x)$: $q(x) = U(x)H(x)$. Equating the two expressions for $q(x)$:\n$$\nU(x) H(x) = a_0 L_a \\left[ 1 - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_{a}}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nTo find $H(x)$, we isolate it by dividing by $U(x)$:\n$$\nH(x) = \\frac{a_0 L_a \\left[ 1 - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_{a}}\\right) \\right]}{U(x)}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute the given expression for the depth-averaged horizontal speed, $U(x) = U_{0}\\left[1 - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_{u}}\\right)\\right]$:\n$$\nH(x) = \\frac{a_0 L_a \\left[ 1 - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_{a}}\\right) \\right]}{U_{0}\\left[1 - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_{u}}\\right)\\right]}\n$$\nThis expression provides the steady-state ice thickness profile $H(x)$ for $x \\in (0, L]$ in terms of the given parameters. The units are consistent, resulting in a thickness in meters, provided $a_0$ is in meters per year, $U_0$ is in meters per year, and $L_a$, $L_u$, and $x$ are in meters.",

            "problem": "Consider an idealized two-dimensional flowline of an ice sheet with horizontal coordinate $x$ and vertical coordinate $z$.

Define the aspect ratio $\\epsilon = H/L$, with $\\epsilon \\ll 1$ in typical interior ice-sheet regions.

In contrast, the Shallow Shelf Approximation (SSA) applies where longitudinal stresses dominate and vertical shear is negligible (e.g., ice shelves with negligible basal drag).\n\nStarting from first principles, consider the $x$-momentum balance of the Stokes equations, which can be written schematically as a balance between the divergence of deviatoric stresses and body forces due to gravity. Use scaling arguments based on the magnitudes of longitudinal stress gradients and vertical shear stress gradients, and the driving stress associated with surface slope, to assess the regimes in which longitudinal stresses become non-negligible relative to vertical shear.

            "solution": "The problem asks us to evaluate statements about the validity of the Shallow Ice Approximation (SIA) and the importance of longitudinal stresses in different glaciological regimes. To do this, we must start from the momentum balance equation and use scaling arguments.\n\n**1. Fundamental Principles and Scaling Analysis**\n\nThe flow of ice is described by the Stokes equations for a very viscous, incompressible fluid. For a two-dimensional flowline in the $(x, z)$ plane, the momentum balance in the horizontal ($x$) direction is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{xx}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{xz}}{\\partial z} = 0 $$\nwhere $\\sigma_{ij}$ are the components of the total stress tensor. The stress tensor can be decomposed into an isotropic pressure $P$ and a deviatoric stress tensor $\\sigma'_{ij}$: $\\sigma_{ij} = -P \\delta_{ij} + \\sigma'_{ij}$. The momentum equation becomes:\n$$ -\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma'_{xx}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma'_{xz}}{\\partial z} = 0 $$\nIn ice sheet modeling, the vertical momentum balance is typically simplified to the hydrostatic approximation, which is highly accurate for low aspect ratio flows ($\\epsilon = H/L \\ll 1$). This leads to the pressure being $P(z) = P_{atm} + \\rho g (s(x) - z)$. The horizontal pressure gradient is then $\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial x} = \\rho g \\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial x}$. Substituting this into the $x$-momentum equation gives:\n$$ -\\rho g \\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma'_{xx}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma'_{xz}}{\\partial z} = 0 $$\nLetting the surface slope magnitude be $\\alpha = |\\partial s / \\partial x| = -\\partial s / \\partial x$ (assuming flow in the positive $x$ direction), the equation is:\n$$ \\underbrace{\\rho g \\alpha}_{\\text{Driving Stress}} = \\underbrace{-\\frac{\\partial \\sigma'_{xx}}{\\partial x}}_{\\text{Longitudinal Stress Gradient}} + \\underbrace{-\\frac{\\partial \\sigma'_{xz}}{\\partial z}}_{\\text{Vertical Shear Stress Gradient}} $$\nThis equation represents the fundamental force balance per unit volume.\n\nWe now perform a scaling analysis to assess the relative magnitudes of these terms. Let $L$ be the characteristic horizontal length scale, $H$ the characteristic ice thickness, $U$ a characteristic horizontal velocity, and $\\eta$ a characteristic effective viscosity. The strain rates scale as:\n- Longitudinal strain rate: $\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\sim \\frac{U}{L}$\n- Shear strain rate: $\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{xz} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}) \\sim \\frac{U}{H}$ (since for $\\epsilon \\ll 1$, $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} \\gg \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}$)\n\nThe deviatoric stresses scale as $\\sigma'_{ij} \\sim \\eta \\dot{\\varepsilon}_{ij}$:\n- Longitudinal stress: $\\sigma'_{xx} \\sim \\eta \\frac{U}{L}$\n- Shear stress: $\\sigma'_{xz} \\sim \\eta \\frac{U}{H}$\n\nNow, we scale the force (gradient) terms in the momentum balance:\n- Longitudinal Stress Gradient ($F_L$): $|-\\frac{\\partial \\sigma'_{xx}}{\\partial x}| \\sim \\frac{[\\sigma'_{xx}]}{[x]} \\sim \\frac{\\eta U/L}{L} = \\frac{\\eta U}{L^2}$\n- Vertical Shear Stress Gradient ($F_S$): $|-\\frac{\\partial \\sigma'_{xz}}{\\partial z}| \\sim \\frac{[\\sigma'_{xz}]}{[z]} \\sim \\frac{\\eta U/H}{H} = \\frac{\\eta U}{H^2}$\n\nThe ratio of the magnitude of the longitudinal stress gradient to the vertical shear stress gradient is:\n$$ \\frac{|F_L|}{|F_S|} \\sim \\frac{\\eta U / L^2}{\\eta U / H^2} = \\frac{H^2}{L^2} = \\left(\\frac{H}{L}\\right)^2 = \\epsilon^2 $$\nThe **Shallow Ice Approximation (SIA)** is valid when longitudinal stress gradients are negligible compared to vertical shear stress gradients, i.e., $|F_L| \\ll |F_S|$. Based on our scaling, this holds true when $\\epsilon^2 = (H/L)^2 \\ll 1$. In the SIA, the momentum balance simplifies to $\\rho g \\alpha \\approx -\\frac{\\partial \\sigma'_{xz}}{\\partial z}$. Integrating this from a depth $z$ to the stress-free surface $s$ gives $\\sigma'_{xz}(z) = \\rho g \\alpha (s-z)$. At the bed ($z=b$), the basal shear stress is $\\tau_b = |\\sigma'_{xz}(b)| = \\rho g \\alpha H$. The SIA thus describes a local balance between driving stress and basal drag.\n\nThe **Shallow Shelf Approximation (SSA)** is used where basal drag is negligible ($\\tau_b \\approx 0$), such as on floating ice shelves. In this case, the SIA predicts no flow ($\\alpha=0$). The momentum balance must be reconsidered by depth-integrating the full equation. This results in the driving stress being balanced by the gradient of the depth-integrated longitudinal stress, with vertical shear playing a negligible role in the overall force balance.\n\n**2. Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. The ratio of the longitudinal stress-gradient magnitude to the vertical shear stress-gradient magnitude scales like $(H/L)^2$. Therefore, longitudinal stresses become important if $L$ is not much larger than $H$, such as near steep margins where $L$ rapidly decreases, and near grounding lines where negligible basal drag necessitates longitudinal transmission of stress.**\n- The first part of the statement, that the ratio scales as $(H/L)^2$, is precisely what our scaling analysis shows. This is correct.\n- The conclusion that longitudinal stresses become important when $L$ is not much larger than $H$ (i.e., the aspect ratio $\\epsilon = H/L$ is not very small) is a direct consequence of this scaling. This is correct.\n- The example of \"steep margins\" is appropriate. In these regions, ice thickness and velocity can change rapidly over short distances, meaning the characteristic length scale $L$ is small, making $\\epsilon$ larger and thus violating the SIA assumption. This is correct.\n- The example of \"grounding lines\" is also correct. As ice goes afloat, $\\tau_b \\to 0$. The local SIA balance fails, and the driving stress must be balanced by gradients in longitudinal stress, which are transmitted from an un-grounded ice shelf or from horizontal variations in velocity. This is the domain of the SSA, where longitudinal stresses are dominant by definition.\n- The entire statement is logically and physically sound.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Near ice divides, the Shallow Ice Approximation improves because $\\alpha \\to 0$ makes all stress terms uniformly small, so neglecting longitudinal stresses is more accurate there than elsewhere.**\n- At an ice divide, the surface slope $\\alpha \\to 0$. Consequently, the driving stress term $\\rho g \\alpha$ in the momentum balance vanishes.\n- The full momentum balance becomes $-\\frac{\\partial \\sigma'_{xx}}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial \\sigma'_{xz}}{\\partial z} \\approx 0$.\n- This shows that the longitudinal stress gradient must exactly balance the vertical shear stress gradient. The SIA, which approximates this balance as $-\\frac{\\partial \\sigma'_{xz}}{\\partial z} \\approx 0$ (because $\\alpha=0$), is fundamentally incorrect. Flow at an ice divide is driven by the outward spreading under gravity, which creates non-zero longitudinal strain rates ($\\partial u / \\partial x > 0$) and thus non-zero longitudinal stress gradients. These cannot be neglected.\n- The statement makes the opposite and incorrect claim.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. A stringent criterion for SIA breakdown near ice divides is that $(H/L)^2 / \\alpha$ becomes order one, because the vertical shear term scales with $\\alpha$ while the longitudinal stress-gradient term does not vanish with $\\alpha$ as strongly; hence, as $\\alpha \\to 0$, longitudinal stresses dominate the balance even if $H/L \\ll 1$.**\n- The reasoning for this criterion involves comparing the neglected longitudinal stress gradient term ($F_L$) to the retained driving stress term ($F_D = \\rho g \\alpha$) in the SIA. The SIA is valid when $|F_L|/|F_D| \\ll 1$.\n- As shown in the general scaling, $|F_L| \\sim (\\eta U / L^2)$. The velocity $U$ is generally driven by the overall ice sheet slope, so it does not go to zero at the divide. The term $F_L$ is therefore relatively independent of the local slope $\\alpha$.\n- The driving stress term $F_D$ is directly proportional to the local slope $\\alpha$.\n- The ratio of the neglected term to the driving stress term is therefore $\\frac{|F_L|}{|F_D|} \\sim \\frac{\\eta U / L^2}{\\rho g \\alpha}$.\n- Using a typical SIA velocity scale $U \\sim (\\rho g \\alpha H^2)/\\eta$ is misleading at the divide. A more careful non-dimensionalization shows the longitudinal term scales with $(H/L)^2$ relative to the characteristic shear term, while the driving stress term scales with the local slope $\\alpha$. Breakdown occurs when the ratio of the longitudinal term to the driving stress term is no longer small, i.e., when $(H/L)^2 \\sim \\alpha$. This can be expressed as the dimensionless group $(H/L)^2 / \\alpha$ becoming of order one.\n- The physical reasoning provided in the option is correct: the driving stress and the vertical shear that balances it in the SIA both scale with $\\alpha$, while the longitudinal stress gradient (related to ice spreading and surface curvature) does not vanish as strongly. Thus, as $\\alpha \\to 0$, the longitudinal term becomes dominant relative to the driving stress, causing the SIA to fail.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. At grounding lines, because basal traction $\\tau_b \\to 0$, vertical shear becomes the primary balance and the Shallow Ice Approximation remains valid; longitudinal stresses remain negligible.**\n- At a grounding line, the ice starts to float and loses contact with the bed, so basal traction $\\tau_b$ must approach zero.\n- The SIA relies on the balance $\\tau_b = \\rho g H \\alpha$. If $\\tau_b \\to 0$, this implies $\\alpha \\to 0$ (unless $H=0$), which is not generally the case. The SIA framework cannot support force balance without basal drag.\n- The force balance must be maintained by the longitudinal stress gradient term, $-\\partial \\sigma'_{xx}/\\partial x$. Thus, longitudinal stresses become dominant, not negligible. The governing approximation transitions from the SIA to the SSA.\n- This statement claims the opposite of what actually happens.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. In floating ice shelves downstream of grounding lines, the Shallow Shelf Approximation (SSA) is the appropriate leading-order model because longitudinal stresses dominate over vertical shear; the Shallow Ice Approximation fails in that regime.**\n- A floating ice shelf has no contact with the bed, so basal shear stress is zero, $\\tau_b = 0$.\n- As explained for option D, the SIA requires $\\tau_b > 0$ to balance the driving stress and is therefore invalid.\n- The physics of an ice shelf involves the driving stress being balanced by gradients in the depth-integrated longitudinal stress. This is the definition of the Shallow Shelf Approximation (SSA). Vertical shear still deforms the ice, but it does not contribute significantly to the depth-integrated momentum balance.\n- The statement accurately describes the physics of ice shelves and the applicability of the SSA vs. the SIA.\n**Verdict: Correct**",

The slope of the bed is the derivative of $b(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(-600 - \\alpha x) = -\\alpha$$\nSubstituting this into the sensitivity expression gives:\n$$\\frac{\\partial H_f}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{\\rho_w}{\\rho_i} (-\\alpha) = \\frac{\\rho_w}{\\rho_i} \\alpha$$\nThis result shows that the rate of change of the flotation thickness is constant for a linearly sloping bed.\n\nFinally, we compute the change in the required thickness for flotation, $\\delta H_f$, for a small inland perturbation of the grounding line position, $\\delta x = 500\\ \\mathrm{m}$, evaluated at $x=0$. For a small perturbation, we can use a linear approximation:\n$$\\delta H_f \\approx \\frac{\\partial H_f}{\\partial x} \\bigg|_{x=0} \\delta x$$\nSince our derived sensitivity $\\frac{\\partial H_f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\rho_w}{\\rho_i} \\alpha$ is constant and does not depend on $x$, this approximation is exact for this problem. Thus:\n$$\\delta H_f = \\left(\\frac{\\rho_w}{\\rho_i} \\alpha\\right) \\delta x$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $\\rho_i = 917\\ \\mathrm{kg}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, $\\rho_w = 1028\\ \\mathrm{kg}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, $\\alpha = 4 \\times 10^{-3}$, and $\\delta x = 500\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n$$\\delta H_f = \\left( \\frac{1028}{917} \\right) \\cdot (4 \\times 10^{-3}) \\cdot (500\\ \\mathrm{m})$$\n$$\\delta H_f = \\left( \\frac{1028}{917} \\right) \\cdot (2\\ \\mathrm{m})$$\n$$\\delta H_f = \\frac{2056}{917}\\ \\mathrm{m} \\approx 2.24209378407...\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$\\delta H_f \\approx 2.242\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\nThis positive value indicates that as the grounding line moves inland by $500\\ \\mathrm{m}$ over the retrograde bed, the ice must become thicker by approximately $2.242\\ \\mathrm{m}$ to remain in hydrostatic equilibrium at the new position.",
