## Introduction
Navigating the multifaceted challenge of climate change requires tools that can bridge the vast and disparate domains of economics, social science, and Earth system science. Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), coupled with the framework of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), have emerged as the principal instruments for this task. They provide a structured way to explore the complex, long-term interactions between human development choices and their consequences for the global climate. This article addresses the need for a comprehensive understanding of how these powerful, yet often opaque, models function and are applied.

To build this understanding, we will first delve into the **Principles and Mechanisms** that form the theoretical core of IAMs, examining their architecture, the economic theories that drive them, and the simplified climate science they employ. Next, in **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, we will explore how these models are operationalized to evaluate climate policies, create consistent scenarios for the wider research community, and bridge the gap to impact studies in fields like public health. Finally, **Hands-On Practices** will provide opportunities to engage directly with the core quantitative concepts discussed. This structured journey will demystify the inner workings of IAMs and showcase their indispensable role in shaping our understanding of the climate future.

## Principles and Mechanisms

Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are computational frameworks that integrate knowledge from diverse scientific domains—including economics, engineering, earth sciences, and social sciences—to explore the complex interactions between human development and the Earth system. This chapter elucidates the core principles and mechanisms that govern the structure and application of these models, providing a foundation for understanding their role in climate change analysis and [policy evaluation](@entry_id:136637).

### The Architecture of Integrated Assessment Models

At their core, IAMs are composed of several interconnected modules, each representing a distinct part of the coupled human-Earth system. A typical decomposition includes modules for the **economy** ($\mathcal{E}$), the **energy system** ($\mathcal{N}$), **land use** ($\mathcal{L}$), the **climate system** ($\mathcal{C}$), and **climate impacts** ($\mathcal{I}$). These modules are designed to simulate the dynamics of stocks (such as capital, atmospheric carbon, or forest area) and flows (such as investment, emissions, or land conversion) over long time horizons, often spanning a century or more .

#### Modeling Paradigms: Top-Down and Bottom-Up

There are two major paradigms for constructing the economic and energy components of IAMs: the **top-down** and **bottom-up** approaches. These paradigms differ fundamentally in their level of aggregation, representation of technology, and mechanism for price formation .

**Top-down models**, often based on a macroeconomic framework like Computable General Equilibrium (CGE), represent the economy at an aggregate level. They use smooth, neoclassical production functions to describe how primary inputs like capital ($K$), labor ($L$), and energy ($E$) are combined to produce economic output. A widely used functional form is the **Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES)** production function. For two inputs, such as capital and energy, the CES function can be written as:

$$ Y = A \left[ \delta K^{\rho} + (1-\delta) E^{\rho} \right]^{\frac{1}{\rho}} $$

Here, $A$ is an efficiency parameter, $\delta$ is a distribution parameter, and the parameter $\rho$ determines the **elasticity of substitution**, $\sigma$, which is constant and given by $\sigma = \frac{1}{1-\rho}$. This elasticity is a critical parameter, as it measures the ease with which one input can be substituted for another in response to a change in their relative prices. A higher $\sigma$ implies greater flexibility to substitute away from carbon-intensive energy, leading to lower projected costs of climate mitigation. The CES function is a general form that contains two other important production functions as special cases :
- As $\rho \to 0$, the elasticity of substitution $\sigma \to 1$, and the CES function converges to the **Cobb-Douglas** form, $Y = A K^{\delta} E^{1-\delta}$.
- As $\rho \to -\infty$, the elasticity of substitution $\sigma \to 0$. In this case, inputs are [perfect complements](@entry_id:142017), and the isoquants approach the right-angled shape of a **Leontief** function, $Y = A \min\{aK, bE\}$.

In top-down models, prices are endogenously determined in simulated markets to ensure that supply and demand are balanced across the entire economy, satisfying general equilibrium conditions. Policy-induced price changes, such as a carbon tax, generate both **substitution effects** (e.g., switching from energy to capital) and **income effects** (changes in overall demand due to changes in real income) .

**Bottom-up models**, in contrast, are characterized by a high level of technological and engineering detail. They typically represent the energy system as a portfolio of specific technologies (e.g., coal-fired power plants, wind turbines, solar panels), each with its own cost, performance, and environmental characteristics. These models often use [optimization techniques](@entry_id:635438), such as linear programming, to find the least-cost combination of technologies to meet a specified, often exogenous, demand for energy services. This approach allows for detailed representation of technical constraints like plant-level operational limits but generally does not capture economy-wide feedbacks, such as income effects on energy demand, unless explicitly coupled to a macroeconomic model. In these models, "prices" emerge not from market clearing but as **[shadow prices](@entry_id:145838)** (Lagrange multipliers) on the system's constraints, representing the marginal cost of meeting a particular constraint, such as an [emissions cap](@entry_id:1124398) .

#### Coupling and Consistency

Integrating these diverse modules into a single, coherent model presents a significant technical challenge, particularly with respect to ensuring the conservation of fundamental quantities like energy and mass. Two primary [coupling strategies](@entry_id:747985) exist: **hard coupling** and **soft linking** .

In a **hard-coupled** model, the different modules are solved simultaneously as a single, unified system. They share state variables and governing equations. For example, the carbon emissions ($E(t)$) calculated by the energy module and the atmospheric carbon stock ($A(t)$) in the climate module would be single, shared variables. This ensures that fundamental conservation laws, such as the atmospheric carbon balance equation $A(t+1) = A(t) + E(t) + L(t) - S(t)$ (where $L(t)$ is land-use flux and $S(t)$ is the sink uptake), hold by construction.

In a **soft-linked** approach, standalone models are run separately and exchange data, often sequentially or iteratively. For instance, an economic model might generate a pathway of energy demand, which is then fed into an energy system model. The energy model calculates emissions, which are then passed to a climate model. While more flexible, this approach creates a significant risk of inconsistencies. If, for example, the economic and energy modules use different internal assumptions or accounting conventions—a common real-world problem—conservation laws can be violated. A hypothetical scenario illustrates this risk: if an energy module calculates emissions $E(t)$ based on a physical emission factor $\alpha$, but the climate module receives a different emissions series $E'(t)$ based on an inconsistent factor $\tilde{\alpha}$ used elsewhere, the modeled carbon cycle will not balance. The magnitude of this "missing" carbon would be $(\alpha - \tilde{\alpha})F(t)$, where $F(t)$ is the final energy demand. Ensuring consistency in soft-linked systems requires meticulous harmonization of all exchanged data and accounting frameworks .

### Representing the Human System: Socio-Economic Pathways and Scenarios

IAMs are not forecasting tools; they are instruments for exploring "what-if" questions about the future. This exploration is structured using **scenarios**, which are plausible and internally consistent descriptions of how the future might unfold. The **Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)** are a canonical scenario framework used by the climate research community to organize these explorations .

Each SSP consists of two key components: a qualitative narrative and a set of quantitative drivers.

- The **qualitative narrative** is a rich, descriptive storyline about future socio-economic development. It addresses key dimensions such as demographics, economic development and lifestyles, policies and institutions, technological change, and international cooperation. These narratives are organized around the challenges they pose for climate change mitigation and adaptation. For example, SSP1 ("Sustainability - Taking the Green Road") describes a world of inclusive development and high environmental consciousness, while SSP3 ("Regional Rivalry - A Rocky Road") depicts a future of fragmentation, conflict, and slow technological growth.

- The **quantitative drivers** are harmonized, numerical projections of a few key variables that serve as common inputs or boundary conditions for IAMs. The core drivers include population ($P(t)$), gross domestic product ($Y(t)$), and urbanization levels ($U(t)$), specified by country or region over time.

In applying the SSP framework, modelers use the quantitative drivers as exogenous inputs that define the scale of the society and economy to be simulated. The qualitative narrative, in turn, guides the parameterization of the model's endogenous relationships. For instance, the SSP1 narrative of rapid technological progress would justify assuming a high rate of autonomous energy efficiency improvement (which lowers energy intensity, $e_y(t)$) and rapid cost reductions for renewable technologies (which lowers the carbon intensity of energy, $c_e(t)$). Conversely, the SSP3 narrative would imply pessimistic assumptions for these parameters. This two-part structure ensures a degree of consistency between the overarching storyline and the detailed mathematical assumptions within the model .

### Representing the Earth System: From Emissions to Climate Change

A central function of an IAM is to translate the socio-economic activities of the human system into physical changes in the Earth system. This involves a complex causal chain that links anthropogenic emissions to changes in climate.

#### Land-Use and the Carbon Cycle

A significant portion of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions originates from land use and land-use change. IAMs incorporate detailed **land-use modules** to track the allocation of land among competing uses—such as cropland, pasture, forests, and land for bioenergy—and the associated [carbon fluxes](@entry_id:194136) . These modules must adhere to the principle of conservation of mass for carbon. The net annual [carbon flux](@entry_id:1122072) to the atmosphere from the land system is the sum of all emission sources minus the sum of all terrestrial sinks. Key components include:

- **Immediate Emissions from Land-Use Change**: When land is converted from one type to another (e.g., forest to cropland), there is often a large, immediate release of carbon. This flux is calculated based on the difference in carbon stocks between the initial and final land types. These stocks are held in different pools, primarily **biomass** (above and below ground) and **soils**, which must be accounted for separately. For example, converting a high-carbon forest (with biomass density $b_F$ and soil carbon $u_F$) to low-carbon cropland ($b_C$, $u_C$) results in a large [carbon flux](@entry_id:1122072) to the atmosphere.
- **Harvested Wood Products**: When forests are cleared, a portion of the biomass may be converted into wood products. This carbon is not immediately released but is transferred to a **harvested wood product pool**, which then decays over time, creating a delayed emission flux.
- **Harvest and Combustion**: In the case of managed lands like bioenergy plantations, there is an ongoing flux associated with the harvest and subsequent combustion of biomass.
- **Net Ecosystem Production (NEP)**: This term represents the net uptake of carbon from the atmosphere by ecosystems due to biological processes (photosynthesis minus respiration). It is typically positive for growing forests and negative (or a source) for some managed lands.

The net land-use flux is the sum of these components, calculated across all land types and transitions. For example, a detailed carbon balance calculation would sum emissions from deforestation, add emissions from decaying wood products and bioenergy use, and subtract the uptake from NEP on remaining managed and unmanaged lands to find the total net flux to the atmosphere for a given year .

#### Climate Emulators and Climate Response Metrics

To simulate the climate system's response to greenhouse gas emissions, most IAMs employ computationally efficient **climate emulators**, often called Simple Climate Models (SCMs). These models capture the essential physics of the climate system at a global-mean level, allowing them to be run thousands of times for policy analysis, a task that would be infeasible with complex Earth System Models (ESMs) . A typical emulator implements the following causal chain: emissions are converted to concentrations using a simplified carbon cycle; concentrations are converted to radiative forcing; and radiative forcing drives temperature change according to a global [energy balance model](@entry_id:195903).

A key concept in this chain is **Radiative Forcing (RF)**. It is defined as the externally imposed change in the net radiative energy balance at the top of the atmosphere, calculated after allowing for rapid atmospheric adjustments but before the global surface temperature has responded. It represents the initial "push" on the climate system from a forcing agent like increased $\text{CO}_2$ .

The sensitivity of the global temperature to this forcing is characterized by two standard metrics:

- **Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS)** is the long-term, equilibrium global mean surface temperature increase that would result from a sustained doubling of atmospheric $\text{CO}_2$ concentrations. It represents the ultimate warming after the oceans and other slow components of the climate system have fully adjusted, a process that takes centuries to millennia.
- **Transient Climate Response (TCR)** is the global mean surface temperature increase at the moment of $\text{CO}_2$ doubling in a scenario where concentrations increase smoothly by $1\%$ per year. Because the system is still in a transient (non-equilibrium) state, a significant portion of the energy imbalance is being used to warm the ocean rather than the surface. Consequently, **TCR is inherently smaller than ECS**.

These two metrics are used to calibrate the climate emulators within IAMs. ECS constrains the model's long-run temperature response, while TCR constrains the pace of warming over the more policy-relevant decadal-to-century timescale . While these emulators can accurately reproduce the global-mean temperature response of more complex ESMs for well-mixed greenhouse gases like $\text{CO}_2$, they have lower fidelity for short-lived, spatially heterogeneous forcing agents like aerosols and ozone. The climate's response depends on the spatial pattern of forcing, an effect that global-mean emulators can only approximate with constant "efficacy" factors, introducing potential biases in scenarios where the mix of forcing agents changes significantly .

#### The TCRE and Carbon Budgets

One of the most powerful emergent properties of the coupled climate-carbon system is the **Transient Climate Response to Cumulative Emissions (TCRE)**. The TCRE is the ratio of the transient global temperature increase to the cumulative amount of $\text{CO}_2$ emitted up to that point: $\text{TCRE}(t) \equiv \frac{\Delta T(t)}{E_{\text{cum}}(t)}$. Remarkably, this ratio is found to be nearly constant across a wide range of emission scenarios and over decadal-to-century timescales .

This near-linearity is the result of a fortuitous cancellation of competing non-linearities. On one hand, the radiative forcing from $\text{CO}_2$ is logarithmic, meaning it becomes less effective at warming the planet as concentrations rise. On the other hand, as the climate warms and $\text{CO}_2$ accumulates, the ocean and land sinks become less efficient at absorbing carbon, causing the airborne fraction of emissions to increase. These two effects—a decreasing warming efficiency of $\text{CO}_2$ and an increasing fraction of it staying in the atmosphere—largely cancel each other out, leading to a robust, nearly linear relationship between total cumulative emissions and transient warming.

The TCRE is the scientific foundation for the concept of a **carbon budget**. Since warming is proportional to cumulative emissions, any given temperature target (e.g., $1.5\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$) implies a finite total amount of $\text{CO}_2$ that can be emitted. By providing a direct link between a policy target and a manageable physical quantity, the TCRE allows IAMs to calculate the [remaining carbon budget](@entry_id:1130832) and explore how that budget might be allocated over time under different socio-economic pathways .

### Economic Principles and Policy Evaluation

Many IAMs are used not only to project the consequences of different scenarios but also to evaluate them from a normative economic perspective, seeking to identify "optimal" policy pathways. This analysis is grounded in the principles of welfare economics.

#### The Climate Externality and Optimal Policy

The normative framework for many IAMs is the **Ramsey social planner problem**. This approach casts the policy challenge as a [dynamic optimization](@entry_id:145322) problem where a benevolent social planner chooses consumption, investment, and abatement levels over time to maximize a [social welfare function](@entry_id:636846), typically the discounted sum of utility of a representative agent . The planner, by definition, internalizes all the connections within the system, including the fact that emissions today cause climate damages in the future. The planner's optimal solution involves abating emissions up to the point where the marginal cost of abatement equals the marginal benefit of avoiding future climate damages.

This socially optimal outcome is contrasted with a **decentralized competitive equilibrium**, which represents the outcome of a market economy without [climate policy](@entry_id:1122477). In such an equilibrium, individual firms and consumers, in pursuing their own self-interest, do not account for the impact of their emissions on the global climate. Each agent correctly perceives their own contribution to be negligible and therefore has no private incentive to abate. This is a classic example of a **[market failure](@entry_id:201143)** due to a **negative [externality](@entry_id:189875)**. The market outcome will feature zero abatement and therefore excessive emissions and climate damages compared to the social optimum.

The gap between the private and social cost of emitting can be corrected by a **Pigouvian tax** on emissions. The optimal tax is equal to the **Social Cost of Carbon (SCC)**, which is formally defined as the [shadow price](@entry_id:137037) on the carbon stock in the planner's optimization problem. It represents the total discounted value of future economic damages, in present-day currency, caused by emitting one additional tonne of $\text{CO}_2$. By setting a [carbon price](@entry_id:1122074) equal to the SCC, the [externality](@entry_id:189875) is internalized, and the decentralized market economy is guided toward the socially [optimal allocation](@entry_id:635142) of resources .

#### Intertemporal Equity and Discounting

Evaluating policies that have costs today and benefits far in the future requires a method for comparing economic values across time. This is accomplished through **discounting**. The choice of discount rate is one of the most critical and ethically contentious aspects of IAM analysis. In the Ramsey framework, the **consumption [discount rate](@entry_id:145874)**, $r_c(t)$, is not an arbitrary parameter but is derived from fundamental ethical assumptions about intertemporal welfare. It is given by the **Ramsey rule**:

$$ r_c(t) = \rho + \eta g(t) $$

This equation has two components :
1.  The **pure rate of time preference**, $\rho$, is a measure of "ethical impatience." It is the rate at which future utility is discounted simply for being in the future, independent of any other considerations. A positive $\rho$ implies that the welfare of future generations is given intrinsically less weight than that of the present generation.
2.  The second term, $\eta g(t)$, is the wealth-based component of [discounting](@entry_id:139170). It is the product of the **elasticity of the marginal utility of consumption**, $\eta$, and the growth rate of per capita consumption, $g(t)$. The parameter $\eta$ measures aversion to inequality; a higher $\eta$ implies that an additional dollar is worth much more to a poor person than to a rich person. If future generations are expected to be richer ($g(t) > 0$), this term dictates that we should discount the value of consumption benefits to them, because in their wealthier state, those benefits will be less valuable at the margin.

The Ramsey rule thus provides a clear framework for understanding how ethical choices ($\rho$, $\eta$) and economic projections ($g(t)$) combine to determine how future climate damages are valued today. For instance, a scenario of slowing long-term growth ($g(t) \to 0$) would cause the consumption [discount rate](@entry_id:145874) to fall, approaching $\rho$. This would increase the present value of far-future damages, making near-term climate policy more urgent .

### Navigating Uncertainty in Integrated Assessment

All models are simplifications of reality, and IAMs, which span disciplines and centuries, are subject to profound uncertainty. Rigorous analysis requires systematically categorizing and assessing these uncertainties. We can distinguish several types of uncertainty within the formal model structure $y_t = f(\theta, \mathcal{S}, x_t)$, where $f$ is the model structure, $\theta$ is the vector of parameters, and $\mathcal{S}$ represents the exogenous scenario drivers .

- **Parametric Uncertainty** concerns the values of the numerical parameters, $\theta$, within a fixed model structure $f$. This uncertainty is often quantifiable with a probability distribution, $p(\theta)$, derived from data or expert judgment. An example is the uncertainty in the value of the elasticity of substitution, $\sigma$.

- **Structural Uncertainty** arises from a lack of consensus on the appropriate model structure, $f$, itself. This includes the choice of equations, which variables to include, and how modules are coupled. An example is the choice between different functional forms for the climate damage function, which may embody fundamentally different theories about the economy's vulnerability to warming.

- **Scenario Uncertainty** relates to the exogenous drivers, $\mathcal{S}$, that provide the boundary conditions for the model. This includes future pathways of population, GDP, or policy choices, as captured by frameworks like the SSPs. These are typically explored as "what-if" narratives without assigned probabilities.

These categories are not always neatly separable, and in some cases, the uncertainty is so profound that it is termed **deep uncertainty**. A state of deep uncertainty exists when there is no agreement among experts on the appropriate model structure $f$, the probability distributions $p(\cdot)$ for key parameters, or even the full range of possible outcomes. The potential for a "tipping cascade" in the climate system is a prime example of deep uncertainty, as both the likelihood and the fundamental structure of such an event are intensely debated . Acknowledging these different layers of uncertainty is crucial for the responsible interpretation and use of IAM results in policy-making.
