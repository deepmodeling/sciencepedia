A core task of parameterization is to represent the collective effect of these sub-grid processes on the grid-scale state. This first exercise provides a foundational look at this process by linking the properties of individual convective updrafts to the grid-cell mean mass flux, a key variable in any convection scheme. By calculating the fractional area $a$ occupied by updrafts, you will see how a model translates microscopic details into a macroscopic, grid-averaged quantity .",

It presents a standard, albeit simplified, problem in the parameterization of sub-grid scale processes, specifically convection, within an atmospheric model.

This exercise explores this question using a fundamental principle from signal processing, the Nyquist sampling theorem, to establish a clear resolvability criterion based on the relationship between grid spacing and the size of a convective updraft. Understanding this hard limit is essential for appreciating why scale-aware schemes are needed to handle the \"gray zone\" where convection is only partially resolved .",

            "problem": "A numerical weather prediction model employs a scale-aware deep convection parameterization that blends parameterized and explicitly resolved convective tendencies according to a partition coefficient that depends on grid spacing and the characteristic scale of convective updrafts. Consider a single horizontal grid cell of size $\\Delta \\times \\Delta$ with grid spacing $\\Delta = 5\\,\\mathrm{km}$. Observations indicate a mean convective updraft radius $r_u = 1\\,\\mathrm{km}$ and a mean convective area fraction within the grid cell of $a = 0.02$.

The expected number of updrafts intersecting the cell is $n = a A_g / A_p$, and the probability of at least one updraft present is $P_{\\geq 1} = 1 - \\exp(-n)$.\n- By the Shannon–Nyquist sampling theorem, a necessary condition for the grid to explicitly resolve a spatial feature of dominant scale $L_u$ is that its dominant wavenumber $k_u = 2\\pi/L_u$ does not exceed the Nyquist wavenumber $k_c = \\pi/\\Delta$.

The provided information is sufficient and consistent for deriving a unique solution. The core of the problem is to determine whether convective updrafts are resolvable by the model grid, which is governed by the relationship between the feature scale and the grid scale, as described by the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem.\n\nThe problem states that a necessary condition for a spatial feature to be explicitly resolved is that its dominant wavenumber, $k_u$, does not exceed the grid's Nyquist wavenumber, $k_c$. This can be expressed as the inequality:\n$$k_u \\leq k_c$$\nIf this condition is not met, i.e., $k_u > k_c$, the feature is considered unresolved, and its contribution to the resolved dynamics is zero. The problem defines this as a \"minimal scale-aware blending sense,\" where the resolved fraction, $f_{\\mathrm{res}}$, is set to zero if the feature is unresolved. Logically, if the feature is resolvable ($k_u \\leq k_c$), its contribution is considered fully resolved in this minimal framework, meaning $f_{\\mathrm{res}} = 1$.\n\nThe problem provides the following definitions:\nThe dominant wavenumber of a convective updraft with characteristic scale (diameter) $L_u$ is:\n$$k_u = \\frac{2\\pi}{L_u}$$\nThe Nyquist wavenumber for a grid with spacing $\\Delta$ is:\n$$k_c = \\frac{\\pi}{\\Delta}$$\n\nSubstituting these definitions into the resolvability condition $k_u \\leq k_c$:\n$$\\frac{2\\pi}{L_u} \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{\\Delta}$$\nDividing both sides by $\\pi$ (which is a positive constant) and rearranging the inequality gives the condition in terms of physical lengths:\n$$\\frac{2}{L_u} \\leq \\frac{1}{\\Delta}$$\n$$2\\Delta \\leq L_u$$\nThe problem also provides that the characteristic scale $L_u$ is the updraft diameter, which is twice its radius, $r_u$:\n$$L_u = 2r_u$$\nSubstituting this into the inequality gives:\n$$2\\Delta \\leq 2r_u$$\n$$\\Delta \\leq r_u$$\nThis is the final diagnostic condition: convection is resolvable if the grid spacing $\\Delta$ is less than or equal to the characteristic updraft radius $r_u$.

Therefore, the condition for resolvability is not met.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the wavenumbers directly.\nThe characteristic scale of the updraft is:\n$$L_u = 2r_u = 2(1\\,\\mathrm{km}) = 2\\,\\mathrm{km}$$\nThe dominant wavenumber of the updraft is:\n$$k_u = \\frac{2\\pi}{L_u} = \\frac{2\\pi}{2\\,\\mathrm{km}} = \\pi\\,\\mathrm{km}^{-1}$$\nThe Nyquist wavenumber of the grid is:\n$$k_c = \\frac{\\pi}{\\Delta} = \\frac{\\pi}{5\\,\\mathrm{km}}$$\nComparing the two wavenumbers:\n$$k_u = \\pi\\,\\mathrm{km}^{-1}$$\n$$k_c = \\frac{\\pi}{5}\\,\\mathrm{km}^{-1}$$\nSince $\\pi > \\frac{\\pi}{5}$, we have $k_u > k_c$.\n\nBased on the problem statement, \"If $k_u > k_c$, then the resolved fraction of convective effects... is taken to be zero\".\nTherefore, the resolved fraction is:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{res}} = 0$$\nThe parameterized fraction, $f_{\\mathrm{par}}$, is defined as what remains, such that the sum of the fractions is unity:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{par}} = 1 - f_{\\mathrm{res}}$$\n$$f_{\\mathrm{par}} = 1 - 0 = 1$$\nThis means that for the given grid spacing and updraft scale, the convection is entirely parameterized. The updrafts are too small to be resolved by the $5\\,\\mathrm{km}$ grid.\n\nThe information regarding the convective area fraction $a = 0.02$ and the derived quantities like the expected number of updrafts $n$ are relevant for calculating the total magnitude of convective activity within the grid cell, but not for determining the partitioning ratio $f_{\\mathrm{res}}/f_{\\mathrm{par}}$, which, in this problem, is based solely on the scale criterion derived from the Nyquist theorem.\n\nThe final answer is the pair of values for the resolved and parameterized fractions.",

The weight $w$ multiplies the parameterized contribution. A general convex combination of two quantities $A$ and $B$ with a weight $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$ applied to $A$ is given by $\\lambda A + (1-\\lambda)B$.\n\nApplying this structure to the heating tendencies, with $Q_c$ as the parameterized term and $w$ as its weight, we have:\n$$\nQ_b = w Q_c + (1-w) Q_r\n$$\nThis expression is consistent with the boundary conditions provided:\n- If $w=1$ (fully parameterized): $Q_b = (1)Q_c + (1-1)Q_r = Q_c$.\n- If $w=0$ (fully resolved): $Q_b = (0)Q_c + (1-0)Q_r = Q_r$.\n\nThe given values are:\n- Parameterized convective heating $Q_c = 4\\,\\mathrm{K\\,day^{-1}}$\n- Resolved heating $Q_r = 3\\,\\mathrm{K\\,day^{-1}}$\n- Blending weight $w = 0.6$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $Q_b$:\n$$\nQ_b = (0.6)(4\\,\\mathrm{K\\,day^{-1}}) + (1 - 0.6)(3\\,\\mathrm{K\\,day^{-1}})\n$$\n$$\nQ_b = 2.4\\,\\mathrm{K\\,day^{-1}} + (0.4)(3\\,\\mathrm{K\\,day^{-1}})\n$$\n$$\nQ_b = 2.4\\,\\mathrm{K\\,day^{-1}} + 1.2\\,\\mathrm{K\\,day^{-1}}\n$$\n$$\nQ_b = 3.6\\,\\mathrm{K\\,day^{-1}}\n$$\nThis is the blended heating tendency.

The source $S$ is a rate with units $\\mathrm{g\\,kg^{-1}\\,day^{-1}}$. For the definition $R = S-D$ to be dimensionally consistent, $D$ must also be treated as a rate. We interpret the given value as the average rate over the one-day interval, i.e., $D = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{g\\,kg^{-1}\\,day^{-1}}$.\n\nUsing this interpretation, we compute the residual:\n$$\nR = (1.44576\\,\\mathrm{g\\,kg^{-1}\\,day^{-1}}) - (0.5\\,\\mathrm{g\\,kg^{-1}\\,day^{-1}})\n$$\n$$\nR = 0.94576\\,\\mathrm{g\\,kg^{-1}\\,day^{-1}}\n$$\nBudget closure is defined by the condition $R=0$. Since $R \\approx 0.9458\\,\\mathrm{g\\,kg^{-1}\\,day^{-1}}$, which is not zero, the rainwater budget does not close in this case. This indicates that the latent heating ($Q_b$) implies a larger source of rainwater than is accounted for by the convective detrainment process ($D$).\n\nThe final quantities to be reported, rounded to four significant figures, are:\n- Blended heating tendency $Q_b = 3.600\\,\\mathrm{K\\,day^{-1}}$.\n- Rainwater budget residual $R = 0.9458\\,\\mathrm{g\\,kg^{-1}\\,day^{-1}}$.",
