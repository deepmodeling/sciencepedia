            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the analysis state $x_a$ using Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation for a simplified variational data assimilation scenario. The state vector is $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. We are given a background (prior) state $x_b \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, an observation $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, a linear observation operator $H = I$, a background error covariance matrix $B = \\sigma_b^2 I$, and an observation error covariance matrix $R = \\sigma_o^2 I$. The variances $\\sigma_b^2$ and $\\sigma_o^2$ are positive scalars, and $I$ is the identity matrix.\n\nThe MAP estimate of the state $x$ is the state that maximizes the posterior probability density function $p(x|y)$. By Bayes' theorem, the posterior is proportional to the product of the likelihood and the prior:\n$$p(x|y) \\propto p(y|x) p(x)$$\nThe problem states that the background and observation errors are independent, zero-mean Gaussian.\nThe prior distribution for the state $x$, based on the background information, is given by $x \\sim \\mathcal{N}(x_b, B)$. Its probability density function is:\n$$p(x) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(x - x_b)^T B^{-1} (x - x_b)\\right)$$\nThe likelihood, or the probability of the observations $y$ given a state $x$, is based on the model $y = Hx + \\epsilon$, where the error $\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, R)$. With $H=I$, this becomes $y = x + \\epsilon$, so $y|x \\sim \\mathcal{N}(x, R)$. The probability density function is:\n$$p(y|x) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(y - Hx)^T R^{-1} (y - Hx)\\right)$$\nMaximizing the posterior $p(x|y)$ is equivalent to maximizing its logarithm, $\\ln(p(x|y))$, which in turn is equivalent to minimizing its negative logarithm. This gives rise to the variational cost function, often denoted by $J(x)$.\n$$J(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(x - x_b)^T B^{-1} (x - x_b) + \\frac{1}{2}(y - Hx)^T R^{-1} (y - Hx)$$\nThe analysis state $x_a$ is the value of $x$ that minimizes this cost function.\n\nWe are given $H=I$, $B = \\sigma_b^2 I$, and $R = \\sigma_o^2 I$.

Expanding the expectation term:\n\\begin{align*} \\mathbb{E} [ \\dots ] &= \\mathbb{E} [ B^{-1}\\epsilon_b\\epsilon_b^{\\top}B^{-1} + B^{-1}\\epsilon_b\\epsilon_o^{\\top}R^{-1}H + H^{\\top}R^{-1}\\epsilon_o\\epsilon_b^{\\top}B^{-1} + H^{\\top}R^{-1}\\epsilon_o\\epsilon_o^{\\top}R^{-1}H ] \\\\ &= B^{-1}\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_b\\epsilon_b^{\\top}]B^{-1} + B^{-1}\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_b\\epsilon_o^{\\top}]R^{-1}H + H^{\\top}R^{-1}\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_o\\epsilon_b^{\\top}]B^{-1} + H^{\\top}R^{-1}\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_o\\epsilon_o^{\\top}]R^{-1}H \\end{align*}\nUsing the error covariance definitions and the uncorrelation assumption ($\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_b\\epsilon_o^{\\top}]=0$), this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E} [ \\dots ] = B^{-1}BB^{-1} + 0 + 0 + H^{\\top}R^{-1}RR^{-1}H = B^{-1} + H^{\\top}R^{-1}H = \\mathcal{H}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $A$:\n$$\nA = \\mathcal{H}^{-1} (\\mathcal{H}) \\mathcal{H}^{-1} = \\mathcal{H}^{-1}\n$$\nTherefore, the analysis error covariance matrix is the inverse of the Hessian of the cost function:\n$$\nA = (B^{-1} + H^{\\top}R^{-1}H)^{-1}\n$$\nThis expression explicitly shows the roles of the Hessian and the adjoint operator $H^{\\top}$ in determining the uncertainty of the analysis.\n\n### Part 2: Computation of Degrees of Freedom for Signal\n\nWe are asked to compute the Degrees of Freedom for Signal, $\\mathrm{DFS} = \\mathrm{tr}(HK)$, for the given matrices:\n$$\nB = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0.2 \\\\ 0.2 & 1.5 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad H = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad R = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.4 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0.6 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe Kalman gain $K$ can be computed using the formula $K = B H^{\\top} (H B H^{\\top} + R)^{-1}$. This form is often numerically convenient as it requires inverting a matrix of size $m \\times m$.\n\nFirst, we compute the components required for this formula.\nThe transpose of $H$ is:\n$$\nH^{\\top} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we compute the product $B H^{\\top}$:\n$$\nB H^{\\top} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0.2 \\\\ 0.2 & 1.5 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1(1) + 0.2(0) & 1(1) + 0.2(1) \\\\ 0.2(1) + 1.5(0) & 0.2(1) + 1.5(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1.2 \\\\ 0.2 & 1.7 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we compute $H B H^{\\top}$:\n$$\nH B H^{\\top} = H (B H^{\\top}) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1.2 \\\\ 0.2 & 1.7 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1(1) + 0(0.2) & 1(1.2) + 0(1.7) \\\\ 1(1) + 1(0.2) & 1(1.2) + 1(1.7) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1.2 \\\\ 1.2 & 2.9 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nLet's define the innovation covariance matrix $S = H B H^{\\top} + R$:\n$$\nS = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1.2 \\\\ 1.2 & 2.9 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0.4 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0.6 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.4 & 1.2 \\\\ 1.2 & 3.5 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTo compute $K$, we need the inverse of $S$. The determinant of $S$ is:\n$$\n\\det(S) = (1.4)(3.5) - (1.2)(1.2) = 4.9 - 1.44 = 3.46\n$$\nThe inverse $S^{-1}$ is:\n$$\nS^{-1} = \\frac{1}{3.46} \\begin{pmatrix} 3.5 & -1.2 \\\\ -1.2 & 1.4 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow we can compute the Kalman gain matrix $K$:\n$$\nK = (B H^{\\top}) S^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1.2 \\\\ 0.2 & 1.7 \\end{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{3.46} \\begin{pmatrix} 3.5 & -1.2 \\\\ -1.2 & 1.4 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nK = \\frac{1}{3.46} \\begin{pmatrix} 1(3.5) + 1.2(-1.2) & 1(-1.2) + 1.2(1.4) \\\\ 0.2(3.5) + 1.7(-1.2) & 0.2(-1.2) + 1.7(1.4) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nK = \\frac{1}{3.46} \\begin{pmatrix} 3.5 - 1.44 & -1.2 + 1.68 \\\\ 0.7 - 2.04 & -0.24 + 2.38 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{3.46} \\begin{pmatrix} 2.06 & 0.48 \\\\ -1.34 & 2.14 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFinally, we compute $\\mathrm{DFS} = \\mathrm{tr}(HK)$. First, we find the matrix product $HK$:\n$$\nHK = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{3.46} \\begin{pmatrix} 2.06 & 0.48 \\\\ -1.34 & 2.14 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{3.46} \\begin{pmatrix} 1(2.06) + 0(-1.34) & 1(0.48) + 0(2.14) \\\\ 1(2.06) + 1(-1.34) & 1(0.48) + 1(2.14) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nHK = \\frac{1}{3.46} \\begin{pmatrix} 2.06 & 0.48 \\\\ 0.72 & 2.62 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe trace of this matrix is the sum of its diagonal elements:\n$$\n\\mathrm{DFS} = \\mathrm{tr}(HK) = \\frac{1}{3.46} (2.06 + 2.62) = \\frac{4.68}{3.46}\n$$\nComputing the numerical value:\n$$\n\\frac{4.68}{3.46} \\approx 1.352601156...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $1.353$.",
