            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of fluid mechanics, internally consistent, and well-posed. The derivation of the instantaneous time rate of change of the total streamwise momentum, $\\frac{dM(t)}{dt}$, is based on the integral form of the conservation of linear momentum, commonly known as the Reynolds Transport Theorem, applied to a specified control volume.\n\nThe integral momentum equation for a control volume (CV) fixed in space, applied in the streamwise ($x$) direction, is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{\\text{CV}} \\rho u \\, dV = \\sum F_x + \\iint_{\\text{CS}_{\\text{in}}} \\rho u (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) \\, dCS - \\iint_{\\text{CS}_{\\text{out}}} \\rho u (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) \\, dCS\n$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the fluid density, $u$ is the streamwise velocity component, $dV$ is a differential volume element, $\\sum F_x$ is the sum of all external forces acting on the fluid within the control volume in the $x$-direction, and the surface integrals represent the net rate of momentum flux across the control surfaces (CS), with $\\mathbf{v}$ being the velocity vector and $\\mathbf{n}$ the outward-pointing normal vector.\n\nLet us analyze each term in the context of the problem statement.\n\nThe left-hand side term is the time rate of change of the total momentum stored within the control volume. The problem defines the total streamwise momentum as $M(t) = \\int_{0}^{L}\\int_{A(x)} \\rho\\, u(x,\\mathbf{r}_\\perp,t)\\, \\mathrm{d}A\\, \\mathrm{d}x$. The integral is taken over the entire control volume, so the left-hand side of the momentum equation is precisely $\\frac{dM(t)}{dt}$, the quantity we seek.\n\nThe momentum flux terms represent the rate at which momentum is transported across the boundaries of the control volume.\n- At the upstream boundary ($x=0$), the section-integrated streamwise momentum flux is given as $\\mathcal{F}_{\\text{in}}$. This corresponds to the momentum entering the control volume.\n- At the downstream boundary ($x=L$), the section-integrated streamwise momentum flux is given as $\\mathcal{F}_{\\text{out}}$. This corresponds to the momentum leaving the control volume.\nThe problem states there is no lateral inflow, so momentum flux through the side boundaries is zero. The free surface has negligible wind stress, and the bed is impermeable, so there is no momentum flux through these surfaces either. Therefore, the net rate of momentum flux is $\\mathcal{F}_{\\text{in}} - \\mathcal{F}_{\\text{out}}$.\n\nThe term $\\sum F_x$ represents the sum of external forces acting on the fluid in the control volume in the streamwise direction. We must consider pressure, gravity, and friction.\n- **Pressure Force ($F_P$)**: The problem states that \"the net streamwise hydrostatic pressure force across the end sections is $0$\". Thus, the contribution of pressure forces at the inlet ($x=0$) and outlet ($x=L$) to the momentum balance is zero.\n- **Gravitational Force ($F_g$)**: The component of gravity in the streamwise direction depends on the bed slope. The problem provides two critical pieces of information: (1) \"the free-surface elevations at $x=0$ and $x=L$ are momentarily equal,\" and (2) the resulting \"net streamwise hydrostatic pressure force across the end sections is $0$\". Let $z_s$ be the free-surface elevation, $z_b$ be the bed elevation, and $h$ be the water depth, such that $z_s = z_b + h$. The hydrostatic pressure force on a rectangular cross-section of width $b$ is $F_P = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho g b h^2$. Condition (2) implies $F_P(0) = F_P(L)$, which requires the depths to be equal, $h(0) = h(L)$. Condition (1) states $z_s(0) = z_s(L)$. Substituting $z_s = z_b + h$, we get $z_b(0) + h(0) = z_b(L) + h(L)$. Since $h(0)=h(L)$, it follows necessarily that $z_b(0) = z_b(L)$. This means the channel bed is horizontal over the specified reach. Consequently, the component of the gravitational force in the streamwise direction is zero.\n- **Friction Force ($F_\\tau$)**: This is the drag force exerted by the river bed on the water. The bed shear stress, $\\tau_b(x)$, acts on the fluid in the direction opposite to the flow (i.e., negative $x$-direction). The differential force $ dF_\\tau$ on a differential bed area $b \\, dx$ is $dF_\\tau = -\\tau_b(x) b \\, dx$. To find the total friction force, we must integrate this expression over the entire length of the bed from $x=0$ to $x=L$.\n$$\nF_\\tau = \\int_0^L -\\tau_b(x) b \\, dx = -b \\int_0^L \\tau_b(x) \\, dx\n$$\nSubstituting the given expression for $\\tau_b(x)$:\n$$\nF_\\tau = -b \\int_0^L \\tau_0 \\left[1+\\alpha \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\right] \\, dx\n$$\nWe can evaluate this integral:\n$$\nF_\\tau = -b \\tau_0 \\left[ \\int_0^L 1 \\, dx + \\alpha \\int_0^L \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\, dx \\right]\n$$\nThe first integral is $\\int_0^L 1 \\, dx = [x]_0^L = L$.\nThe second integral is $\\int_0^L \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\, dx = \\left[-\\frac{L}{\\pi} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\right]_0^L = -\\frac{L}{\\pi} (\\cos(\\pi) - \\cos(0)) = -\\frac{L}{\\pi} (-1 - 1) = \\frac{2L}{\\pi}$.\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for $F_\\tau$:\n$$\nF_\\tau = -b \\tau_0 \\left(L + \\alpha \\frac{2L}{\\pi}\\right) = -bL\\tau_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{2\\alpha}{\\pi}\\right)\n$$\n\nAssembling all the terms into the momentum balance equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dM(t)}{dt} = (\\mathcal{F}_{\\text{in}} - \\mathcal{F}_{\\text{out}}) + F_P + F_g + F_\\tau\n$$\nWith $F_P=0$ and $F_g=0$ as determined above, the equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{dM(t)}{dt} = \\mathcal{F}_{\\text{in}} - \\mathcal{F}_{\\text{out}} + F_\\tau\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for the friction force $F_\\tau$:\n$$\n\\frac{dM(t)}{dt} = \\mathcal{F}_{\\text{in}} - \\mathcal{F}_{\\text{out}} - bL\\tau_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{2\\alpha}{\\pi}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytic expression for the instantaneous time rate of change of the total streamwise momentum of the water within the reach, in terms of the given parameters.",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of fluid dynamics on a rotating body, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and objectively formulated. The problem is a standard derivation of Ekman transport, a fundamental concept in physical oceanography.\n\nThe analysis begins with the horizontal momentum equations for a fluid in a rotating frame of reference. Under the stated assumptions of a steady state ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}=0$), horizontal homogeneity ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}=0$, $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}=0$), the Boussinesq approximation (density $\\rho$ is constant), and negligible horizontal pressure gradients ($\\nabla_h p = 0$), the momentum equations simplify significantly. The advective terms $(\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{u}$ vanish due to horizontal homogeneity and the resulting zero vertical velocity. The balance is thus between the Coriolis force and the vertical divergence of the turbulent stress.\n\nLet $\\mathbf{u} = u\\hat{\\mathbf{i}} + v\\hat{\\mathbf{j}}$ be the horizontal velocity vector, where $u$ is the eastward component and $v$ is the northward component. Let $\\mathbf{\\tau}_z = \\tau_{xz}\\hat{\\mathbf{i}} + \\tau_{yz}\\hat{\\mathbf{j}}$ be the vertical turbulent stress vector. The simplified momentum equations in component form are:\n$$\n-f v = \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\tau_{xz}}{\\mathrm{d}z}\n$$\n$$\nf u = \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\tau_{yz}}{\\mathrm{d}z}\n$$\nHere, $f=2\\Omega\\sin\\phi$ is the Coriolis parameter, and $\\rho$ is the constant density of the mixed layer. The vertical coordinate $z$ is positive upwards.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the vertically integrated transport vector, $\\mathbf{M} = \\int \\mathbf{u}(z)\\,\\mathrm{d}z$. We achieve this by integrating the momentum equations over the depth of the Ekman layer. Let the sea surface be at $z=z_s$ and the base of the Ekman layer be at $z=z_b$. The integration is performed from $z_b$ to $z_s$.\n\nIntegrating the $x$-momentum equation (which involves the $v$ component of velocity):\n$$\n\\int_{z_b}^{z_s} -f v(z) \\, \\mathrm{d}z = \\int_{z_b}^{z_s} \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\tau_{xz}}{\\mathrm{d}z} \\, \\mathrm{d}z\n$$\nSince $f$ and $\\rho$ are constant with depth, they can be factored out of the integral:\n$$\n-f \\int_{z_b}^{z_s} v(z) \\, \\mathrm{d}z = \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\int_{z_b}^{z_s} \\mathrm{d}\\tau_{xz} = \\frac{1}{\\rho} [\\tau_{xz}(z_s) - \\tau_{xz}(z_b)]\n$$\nSimilarly, integrating the $y$-momentum equation (which involves the $u$ component of velocity):\n$$\n\\int_{z_b}^{z_s} f u(z) \\, \\mathrm{dz} = \\int_{z_b}^{z_s} \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\tau_{yz}}{\\mathrm{d}z} \\, \\mathrm{d}z\n$$\n$$\nf \\int_{z_b}^{z_s} u(z) \\, \\mathrm{d}z = \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\int_{z_b}^{z_s} \\mathrm{d}\\tau_{yz} = \\frac{1}{\\rho} [\\tau_{yz}(z_s) - \\tau_{yz}(z_b)]\n$$\nThe components of the vertically integrated transport vector $\\mathbf{M}$ are defined as $M_x = \\int_{z_b}^{z_s} u(z) \\, \\mathrm{d}z$ and $M_y = \\int_{z_b}^{z_s} v(z) \\, \\mathrm{d}z$.

Thus, $\\tau_{xz}(z_b) = 0$ and $\\tau_{yz}(z_b) = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these boundary conditions into the equations for $M_x$ and $M_y$:\nFor $M_x$:\n$$\nf M_x = \\frac{1}{\\rho} [0 - 0] = 0 \\implies M_x = 0\n$$\nFor $M_y$:\n$$\n-f M_y = \\frac{1}{\\rho} [\\tau_x - 0] = \\frac{\\tau_x}{\\rho}\n$$\nSolving for $M_y$, the meridional (northward) component of the transport:\n$$\nM_y = -\\frac{\\tau_x}{\\rho f}\n$$\nThe total transport vector is therefore $\\mathbf{M} = M_x\\hat{\\mathbf{i}} + M_y\\hat{\\mathbf{j}} = -\\frac{\\tau_x}{\\rho f}\\hat{\\mathbf{j}}$. This shows that the net transport is directed perpendicular to the wind stress.\n\nThe final step is to express $M_y$ in terms of the given parameters, including the explicit form of the Coriolis parameter, $f = 2\\Omega\\sin\\phi$:\n$$\nM_y = -\\frac{\\tau_x}{\\rho (2\\Omega\\sin\\phi)}\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytical expression for the meridional transport component.",
