This practice guides you through a fundamental derivation, applying the conservation of momentum principle to an idealized oceanic surface layer. By balancing the wind stress at the surface with the Coriolis force acting on the moving water, you will derive the net Ekman transport, revealing the surprising result that the bulk movement of water is perpendicular to the direction of the wind .",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of fluid dynamics on a rotating body, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and objectively formulated. The problem is a standard derivation of Ekman transport, a fundamental concept in physical oceanography.\n\nThe analysis begins with the horizontal momentum equations for a fluid in a rotating frame of reference. Under the stated assumptions of a steady state ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}=0$), horizontal homogeneity ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}=0$, $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}=0$), the Boussinesq approximation (density $\\rho$ is constant), and negligible horizontal pressure gradients ($\\nabla_h p = 0$), the momentum equations simplify significantly. The advective terms $(\\boldsymbol{u}\\cdot\\nabla)\\boldsymbol{u}$ vanish due to horizontal homogeneity and the resulting zero vertical velocity. The balance is thus between the Coriolis force and the vertical divergence of the turbulent stress.\n\nLet $\\boldsymbol{u} = u\\hat{i} + v\\hat{j}$ be the horizontal velocity vector, where $u$ is the eastward component and $v$ is the northward component. Let $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_z = \\tau_{xz}\\hat{i} + \\tau_{yz}\\hat{j}$ be the vertical turbulent stress vector. The simplified momentum equations in component form are:\n$$\n-f v = \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\tau_{xz}}{\\mathrm{d}z}\n$$\n$$\nf u = \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\tau_{yz}}{\\mathrm{d}z}\n$$\nHere, $f=2\\Omega\\sin\\phi$ is the Coriolis parameter, and $\\rho$ is the constant density of the mixed layer. The vertical coordinate $z$ is positive upwards.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the vertically integrated transport vector, $\\boldsymbol{M} = \\int \\boldsymbol{u}(z)\\,\\mathrm{d}z$. We achieve this by integrating the momentum equations over the depth of the Ekman layer. Let the sea surface be at $z=z_s$ and the base of the Ekman layer be at $z=z_b$. The integration is performed from $z_b$ to $z_s$.\n\nIntegrating the $x$-momentum equation (which involves the $v$ component of velocity):\n$$\n\\int_{z_b}^{z_s} -f v(z) \\, \\mathrm{d}z = \\int_{z_b}^{z_s} \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\tau_{xz}}{\\mathrm{d}z} \\, \\mathrm{d}z\n$$\nSince $f$ and $\\rho$ are constant with depth, they can be factored out of the integral:\n$$\n-f \\int_{z_b}^{z_s} v(z) \\, \\mathrm{d}z = \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\int_{z_b}^{z_s} \\mathrm{d}\\tau_{xz} = \\frac{1}{\\rho} [\\tau_{xz}(z_s) - \\tau_{xz}(z_b)]\n$$\nSimilarly, integrating the $y$-momentum equation (which involves the $u$ component of velocity):\n$$\n\\int_{z_b}^{z_s} f u(z) \\, \\mathrm{dz} = \\int_{z_b}^{z_s} \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\tau_{yz}}{\\mathrm{d}z} \\, \\mathrm{d}z\n$$\n$$\nf \\int_{z_b}^{z_s} u(z) \\, \\mathrm{d}z = \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\int_{z_b}^{z_s} \\mathrm{d}\\tau_{yz} = \\frac{1}{\\rho} [\\tau_{yz}(z_s) - \\tau_{yz}(z_b)]\n$$\nThe components of the vertically integrated transport vector $\\boldsymbol{M}$ are defined as $M_x = \\int_{z_b}^{z_s} u(z) \\, \\mathrm{d}z$ and $M_y = \\int_{z_b}^{z_s} v(z) \\, \\mathrm{d}z$. The problem's notation $\\boldsymbol{M}=\\int_{0}^{H}\\boldsymbol{u}(z)\\,\\mathrm{d}z$ represents this same physical quantity, an integral over the entire layer thickness. Substituting these definitions into the integrated equations yields:\n$$\n-f M_y = \\frac{1}{\\rho} [\\tau_{xz}(z_s) - \\tau_{xz}(z_b)]\n$$\n$$\nf M_x = \\frac{1}{\\rho} [\\tau_{yz}(z_s) - \\tau_{yz}(z_b)]\n$$\nNext, we apply the boundary conditions provided in the problem statement:\n$1$. At the sea surface ($z_s$), the turbulent stress within the ocean is equal to the wind stress applied by the atmosphere. The wind stress is given as $\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\tau_x \\hat{i}$. Therefore, its components are $\\tau_{xz}(z_s) = \\tau_x$ and $\\tau_{yz}(z_s) = 0$.\n$2$. At the base of the Ekman layer ($z_b$), the turbulent stress vanishes. Thus, $\\tau_{xz}(z_b) = 0$ and $\\tau_{yz}(z_b) = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these boundary conditions into the equations for $M_x$ and $M_y$:\nFor $M_x$:\n$$\nf M_x = \\frac{1}{\\rho} [0 - 0] = 0 \\implies M_x = 0\n$$\nFor $M_y$:\n$$\n-f M_y = \\frac{1}{\\rho} [\\tau_x - 0] = \\frac{\\tau_x}{\\rho}\n$$\nSolving for $M_y$, the meridional (northward) component of the transport:\n$$\nM_y = -\\frac{\\tau_x}{\\rho f}\n$$\nThe total transport vector is therefore $\\boldsymbol{M} = M_x\\hat{i} + M_y\\hat{j} = -\\frac{\\tau_x}{\\rho f}\\hat{j}$. This shows that the net transport is directed perpendicular to the wind stress.\n\nThe final step is to express $M_y$ in terms of the given parameters, including the explicit form of the Coriolis parameter, $f = 2\\Omega\\sin\\phi$:\n$$\nM_y = -\\frac{\\tau_x}{\\rho (2\\Omega\\sin\\phi)}\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytical expression for the meridional transport component.",

The validation process confirms the problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains sufficient, consistent information for a unique solution.
