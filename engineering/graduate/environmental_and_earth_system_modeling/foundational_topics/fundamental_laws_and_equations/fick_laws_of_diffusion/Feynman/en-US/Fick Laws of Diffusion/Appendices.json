A position-dependent diffusion coefficient is a physically realistic scenario in inhomogeneous materials. The setup is standard in physical chemistry and chemical engineering. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem specifies a one-dimensional, second-order boundary value problem (reducible to first order at steady state) with two Dirichlet boundary conditions. This structure is well-posed and guarantees a unique, stable solution for the concentration profile and flux.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated using precise, unambiguous scientific language. All quantities are clearly defined.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is self-contained, scientifically grounded, well-posed, and free from any logical inconsistencies or factual errors. It is therefore deemed **valid**. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe macroscopic mass conservation for a species with concentration $C$ in a one-dimensional system without chemical reactions is given by the continuity equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x} = 0 $$\nwhere $J$ is the molar flux. At steady state, all time derivatives vanish, so $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = 0$. This implies:\n$$ \\frac{dJ}{dx} = 0 $$\nThis equation signifies that the steady-state flux $J$ must be constant throughout the slab, independent of the position $x$.\n\nThe local phenomenological relation between flux and concentration gradient in an inhomogeneous medium is given by Fick's first law:\n$$ J = -D(x) \\frac{dC}{dx} $$\nHere, $J$ is the constant steady-state flux and $D(x)$ is the given position-dependent diffusion coefficient, $D(x) = D_0 (1 + \\alpha x)$. Combining these gives a first-order ordinary differential equation for the concentration profile $C(x)$:\n$$ J = -D_0 (1 + \\alpha x) \\frac{dC}{dx} $$\nTo solve for $C(x)$, we separate the variables:\n$$ dC = -\\frac{J}{D_0 (1 + \\alpha x)} dx $$\nWe integrate this equation from the boundary at $x=0$ to an arbitrary position $x$ within the slab:\n$$ \\int_{C(0)}^{C(x)} dC' = -\\frac{J}{D_0} \\int_{0}^{x} \\frac{1}{1 + \\alpha x'} dx' $$\nUsing the boundary condition $C(0) = C_0$, the left-hand side integrates to $C(x) - C_0$. The right-hand side integral is a standard logarithmic form:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{x} \\frac{dx'}{1 + \\alpha x'} = \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\ln(1 + \\alpha x') \\right]_{0}^{x} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\left( \\ln(1 + \\alpha x) - \\ln(1) \\right) = \\frac{\\ln(1 + \\alpha x)}{\\alpha} $$\nThis integration is valid for $\\alpha \\neq 0$. The case $\\alpha = 0$ corresponds to a constant diffusion coefficient and can be recovered as a limit. Substituting the result of the integration, we obtain the concentration profile in terms of the yet unknown flux $J$:\n$$ C(x) - C_0 = -\\frac{J}{D_0} \\left( \\frac{\\ln(1 + \\alpha x)}{\\alpha} \\right) $$\n$$ C(x) = C_0 - \\frac{J}{\\alpha D_0} \\ln(1 + \\alpha x) $$\nTo determine the constant flux $J$, we apply the second boundary condition at $x=L$, where $C(L) = C_L$:\n$$ C_L = C_0 - \\frac{J}{\\alpha D_0} \\ln(1 + \\alpha L) $$\nRearranging this equation to solve for $J$:\n$$ \\frac{J}{\\alpha D_0} \\ln(1 + \\alpha L) = C_0 - C_L $$\n$$ J = \\frac{\\alpha D_0 (C_0 - C_L)}{\\ln(1 + \\alpha L)} $$\nThis is the exact closed-form expression for the steady-state flux. The corresponding concentration profile is found by substituting this expression for $J$ back into the equation for $C(x)$:\n$$ C(x) = C_0 - \\frac{\\alpha D_0 (C_0 - C_L)}{\\ln(1 + \\alpha L)} \\frac{\\ln(1 + \\alpha x)}{\\alpha D_0} = C_0 - (C_0 - C_L) \\frac{\\ln(1 + \\alpha x)}{\\ln(1 + \\alpha L)} $$\n\nNext, we analyze the limiting behavior of the flux $J$.\n\nCase 1: Small $|\\alpha|L$ (i.e., $\\alpha L \\to 0$)\nThis limit corresponds to a nearly homogeneous medium. We use the Taylor series expansion for the natural logarithm, $\\ln(1+y) = y - \\frac{y^2}{2} + O(y^3)$, with $y = \\alpha L$.\n$$ \\ln(1 + \\alpha L) = \\alpha L - \\frac{(\\alpha L)^2}{2} + O((\\alpha L)^3) $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $J$:\n$$ J = \\frac{\\alpha D_0 (C_0 - C_L)}{\\alpha L - \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha^2 L^2 + \\dots} = \\frac{\\alpha D_0 (C_0 - C_L)}{\\alpha L \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha L + \\dots\\right)} $$\n$$ J = \\frac{D_0 (C_0 - C_L)}{L} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha L + \\dots\\right)^{-1} $$\nUsing the geometric series approximation $(1-z)^{-1} \\approx 1+z$ for small $z$:\n$$ J \\approx \\frac{D_0 (C_0 - C_L)}{L} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha L\\right) $$\nThe leading-order term is $J \\approx \\frac{D_0 (C_0 - C_L)}{L}$. This is precisely Fick's law for a constant diffusion coefficient $D_0$, which is expected. The first-order correction term indicates that the effective diffusion coefficient for the slab is approximately the arithmetic average of $D(x)$ over the interval $[0,L]$, since $\\bar{D} = \\frac{1}{L}\\int_0^L D_0(1+\\alpha x)dx = D_0(1+\\frac{\\alpha L}{2})$.\n\nCase 2: Large positive $\\alpha L$ (i.e., $\\alpha L \\to \\infty$)\nIn this limit, the diffusion coefficient increases steeply with $x$. The term $\\ln(1+\\alpha L)$ grows logarithmically with $\\alpha L$. The asymptotic behavior of the flux is:\n$$ J \\approx \\frac{\\alpha D_0 (C_0 - C_L)}{\\ln(\\alpha L)} $$\nThe flux grows with $\\alpha$, but sub-linearly, as $\\alpha/\\ln(\\alpha)$.\nPhysical interpretation: An alternative expression for the flux is $J = (C_0-C_L) / R_{diff}$, where $R_{diff} = \\int_0^L \\frac{dx}{D(x)}$ is the total diffusive resistance. Here, $R_{diff} = \\frac{\\ln(1+\\alpha L)}{\\alpha D_0}$. As $\\alpha \\to \\infty$, the local resistivity $1/D(x) = 1/(D_0(1+\\alpha x))$ becomes very large for small $x$ and very small for large $x$. The total resistance is therefore dominated by the region near $x=0$. The majority of the concentration drop occurs in a thin layer near $x=0$ where the diffusivity is lowest, while the concentration profile is nearly flat across the rest of the slab where diffusivity is high. The system's bottleneck is the entry region at $x=0$. While increasing $\\alpha$ makes most of the slab highly permeable, the flux remains limited by this bottleneck, explaining the sub-linear growth of $J$ with $\\alpha$.",

            "solution": "### Solution Derivation\n\nThe derivation begins with the principle of mass conservation. For a one-dimensional system without sources or sinks (negligible reaction), the conservation equation for a solute with concentration $c(x,t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x} = 0\n$$\nwhere $J$ is the solute flux. The problem states that transport is governed by Fickian diffusion. Fick's first law defines the diffusive flux as being proportional to the negative of the concentration gradient:\n$$\nJ = -D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the constant diffusion coefficient. Substituting Fick's first law into the conservation equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(-D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\right) = 0\n$$\nSince $D$ is constant, this simplifies to Fick's second law of diffusion, which is the governing PDE for this problem:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2} \\quad \\text{for } x0, t0\n$$\nThe problem is subject to the following initial and boundary conditions:\n1.  Initial Condition (IC): $c(x, 0) = c_0$ for $x \\geq 0$.\n2.  Boundary Condition 1 (BC1): $c(0, t) = c_s$ for $t  0$.\n3.  Boundary Condition 2 (BC2): $c(x \\to \\infty, t) = c_0$ for $t  0$. This condition reflects the fact that at a location infinitely far from the boundary source, the concentration remains at its initial value.\n\nThis problem lacks a characteristic length or time scale, which suggests a solution can be found using a similarity transformation. We combine the independent variables $x$ and $t$ into a single dimensionless similarity variable, $\\eta$:\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{4Dt}}\n$$\nThe factor of $4$ is a standard convention that simplifies the resulting ordinary differential equation (ODE). We assume the solution $c(x,t)$ can be expressed as a function of $\\eta$ alone, $c(x,t) = f(\\eta)$. We use the chain rule to transform the partial derivatives in the PDE into ordinary derivatives with respect to $\\eta$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = \\frac{df}{d\\eta}\\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t} = \\frac{df}{d\\eta} \\left( \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{4D}} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}t^{-3/2}\\right) \\right) = -\\frac{df}{d\\eta} \\frac{x}{2t\\sqrt{4Dt}} = -\\frac{\\eta}{2t}\\frac{df}{d\\eta}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} = \\frac{df}{d\\eta}\\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial x} = \\frac{df}{d\\eta}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4Dt}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{df}{d\\eta}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4Dt}}\\right) = \\frac{d^2f}{d\\eta^2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial x}\\right)\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4Dt}} = \\frac{d^2f}{d\\eta^2} \\frac{1}{4Dt}\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the PDE gives:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\eta}{2t}\\frac{df}{d\\eta} = D \\left( \\frac{1}{4Dt} \\frac{d^2f}{d\\eta^2} \\right)\n$$\nSimplifying this equation yields the ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2f}{d\\eta^2} + 2\\eta\\frac{df}{d\\eta} = 0\n$$\nNext, we transform the boundary conditions into conditions on $f(\\eta)$:\n1.  BC1: $c(0, t) = c_s$ corresponds to $\\eta = 0/\\sqrt{4Dt} = 0$. Thus, $f(0) = c_s$.\n2.  BC2: $c(x \\to \\infty, t) = c_0$ corresponds to $\\eta \\to \\infty$. Thus, $f(\\eta \\to \\infty) = c_0$.\n\nTo solve the ODE, let $g(\\eta) = df/d\\eta$. The equation becomes a first-order separable ODE for $g$:\n$$\n\\frac{dg}{d\\eta} = -2\\eta g \\implies \\frac{dg}{g} = -2\\eta d\\eta\n$$\nIntegrating both sides gives $\\ln(g) = -\\eta^2 + K_1$, or $g(\\eta) = A \\exp(-\\eta^2)$, where $A = \\exp(K_1)$ is a constant of integration. Since $g = df/d\\eta$, we integrate again to find $f(\\eta)$:\n$$\nf(\\eta) = \\int A \\exp(-\\xi^2) d\\xi + B\n$$\nwhere $B$ is a second integration constant. Using the boundary condition $f(0) = c_s$, we can write a definite integral:\n$$\nf(\\eta) - f(0) = \\int_0^\\eta A \\exp(-\\xi^2) d\\xi \\implies f(\\eta) = c_s + A \\int_0^\\eta \\exp(-\\xi^2) d\\xi\n$$\nNow, we apply the second boundary condition, $f(\\eta \\to \\infty) = c_0$:\n$$\nc_0 = c_s + A \\int_0^\\infty \\exp(-\\xi^2) d\\xi\n$$\nThe definite integral is a known Gaussian integral, $\\int_0^\\infty \\exp(-\\xi^2) d\\xi = \\sqrt{\\pi}/2$. Substituting this value:\n$$\nc_0 = c_s + A \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} \\implies A = \\frac{2(c_0 - c_s)}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $A$ back into the solution for $f(\\eta)$:\n$$\nf(\\eta) = c_s + \\frac{2(c_0 - c_s)}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\int_0^\\eta \\exp(-\\xi^2) d\\xi\n$$\nThis expression can be written compactly using the definition of the error function, $\\text{erf}(z) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\int_0^z \\exp(-t^2) dt$:\n$$\nf(\\eta) = c_s + (c_0 - c_s)\\text{erf}(\\eta)\n$$\nSubstituting back $\\eta = x/\\sqrt{4Dt} = x/(2\\sqrt{Dt})$, we obtain the explicit analytic expression for the concentration field $c(x,t)$:\n$$\nc(x,t) = c_s + (c_0 - c_s)\\text{erf}\\left(\\frac{x}{2\\sqrt{Dt}}\\right)\n$$\nNext, we find the penetration depth $x_{1/2}(t)$, defined as the location where the concentration is the arithmetic mean of the surface and initial concentrations, $c(x_{1/2},t) = \\frac{c_s + c_0}{2}$. We set our solution equal to this value:\n$$\n\\frac{c_s + c_0}{2} = c_s + (c_0 - c_s)\\text{erf}\\left(\\frac{x_{1/2}}{2\\sqrt{Dt}}\\right)\n$$\nSolving for the error function term:\n$$\n\\frac{c_0 - c_s}{2} = (c_0 - c_s)\\text{erf}\\left(\\frac{x_{1/2}}{2\\sqrt{Dt}}\\right)\n$$\nSince the problem states $c_s \\neq c_0$, we can divide by $(c_0 - c_s)$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\text{erf}\\left(\\frac{x_{1/2}}{2\\sqrt{Dt}}\\right)\n$$\nTo isolate $x_{1/2}$, we apply the inverse error function, $\\text{arcerf}$, to both sides:\n$$\n\\text{arcerf}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{x_{1/2}}{2\\sqrt{Dt}}\n$$\nSolving for $x_{1/2}(t)$ gives the explicit analytic expression for the penetration depth:\n$$\nx_{1/2}(t) = 2 \\text{arcerf}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\sqrt{Dt}\n$$\nThis expression demonstrates the required scaling. The term $2 \\text{arcerf}(1/2)$ is a constant. Let this constant be $\\beta = 2 \\text{arcerf}(1/2)$. Then $x_{1/2}(t) = \\beta \\sqrt{Dt}$.

It describes a standard one-dimensional, steady-state diffusion-reaction system, a fundamental topic in physical chemistry and transport phenomena. All necessary conditions and parameters are provided to derive a unique and meaningful solution. The problem is therefore valid. We shall proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nFirst, we derive the governing differential equation from the principle of conservation of mass. Consider a differential control volume element of the slab with area $A$ and thickness $\\Delta x$, from position $x$ to $x + \\Delta x$. The mass balance for the solute in this volume is:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Accumulation} = \\text{Rate of Inflow} - \\text{Rate of Outflow} + \\text{Rate of Generation}\n$$\nIn mathematical terms, this is written as:\n$$\nA \\Delta x \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = (A J_x)|_x - (A J_x)|_{x+\\Delta x} + R (A \\Delta x)\n$$\nwhere $c(x,t)$ is the solute concentration, $J_x$ is the molar flux in the $x$-direction, and $R$ is the volumetric rate of reaction.

We are given two constitutive relations. First, Fick's first law defines the diffusive flux:\n$$\nJ_x = -D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusivity, which is stated to be a constant. Second, the solute is consumed by a first-order reaction with rate $R = -k c$, where $k$ is a positive rate constant. Substituting these into the conservation equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(-D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\right) - k c\n$$\nSince $D$ is constant, it can be taken out of the derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2} - k c\n$$\nThis is the general reaction-diffusion equation for this system. The problem asks for the steady-state concentration profile, $c(x)$, which means the concentration does not change with time. Therefore, the accumulation term is zero: $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = 0$. The partial derivatives with respect to $x$ become ordinary derivatives, as $c$ is now only a function of $x$. The steady-state governing equation is:\n$$\nD \\frac{d^2 c}{dx^2} - k c = 0\n$$\nwhich can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 c}{dx^2} - \\frac{k}{D} c = 0\n$$\nThis is a second-order, linear, homogeneous ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients.\n\nNext, we must state the boundary conditions.\n1. At the boundary $x=0$, the concentration is held at a constant value $c_0$:\n$$\nc(0) = c_0\n$$\n2. At the boundary $x=L$, the slab is impermeable. This means there is zero net transport across the boundary, so the diffusive flux is zero: $J_x(L) = 0$. Using Fick's first law:\n$$\nJ_x(L) = -D \\frac{dc}{dx}\\Bigg|_{x=L} = 0\n$$\nSince $D$ is a non-zero constant, this implies that the gradient of the concentration is zero at this boundary:\n$$\n\\frac{dc}{dx}\\Bigg|_{x=L} = 0\n$$\nWe now solve the boundary value problem. Let $\\lambda^2 = \\frac{k}{D}$. The governing equation becomes $\\frac{d^2 c}{dx^2} - \\lambda^2 c = 0$. The characteristic equation is $r^2 - \\lambda^2 = 0$, with roots $r = \\pm \\lambda$. The general solution can be written in terms of exponential functions or, more conveniently for this problem, hyperbolic functions:\n$$\nc(x) = C_1 \\cosh(\\lambda x) + C_2 \\sinh(\\lambda x)\n$$\nWe determine the constants of integration, $C_1$ and $C_2$, by applying the boundary conditions.\nApplying the first boundary condition, $c(0) = c_0$:\n$$\nc(0) = C_1 \\cosh(0) + C_2 \\sinh(0) = C_1(1) + C_2(0) = C_1\n$$\nThus, $C_1 = c_0$. The solution takes the form:\n$$\nc(x) = c_0 \\cosh(\\lambda x) + C_2 \\sinh(\\lambda x)\n$$\nTo apply the second boundary condition, we first differentiate $c(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{dc}{dx} = c_0 \\lambda \\sinh(\\lambda x) + C_2 \\lambda \\cosh(\\lambda x)\n$$\nNow, we apply the condition $\\frac{dc}{dx}\\Big|_{x=L} = 0$:\n$$\nc_0 \\lambda \\sinh(\\lambda L) + C_2 \\lambda \\cosh(\\lambda L) = 0\n$$\nSince $\\lambda = \\sqrt{k/D} \\ne 0$, we can divide by $\\lambda$:\n$$\nc_0 \\sinh(\\lambda L) + C_2 \\cosh(\\lambda L) = 0\n$$\nSolving for $C_2$:\n$$\nC_2 = -c_0 \\frac{\\sinh(\\lambda L)}{\\cosh(\\lambda L)} = -c_0 \\tanh(\\lambda L)\n$$\nSubstituting $C_1$ and $C_2$ back into the general solution for $c(x)$:\n$$\nc(x) = c_0 \\cosh(\\lambda x) - c_0 \\tanh(\\lambda L) \\sinh(\\lambda x)\n$$\n$$\nc(x) = c_0 \\left( \\cosh(\\lambda x) - \\frac{\\sinh(\\lambda L)}{\\cosh(\\lambda L)} \\sinh(\\lambda x) \\right)\n$$\nTo simplify this expression, we combine the terms over a common denominator:\n$$\nc(x) = c_0 \\left( \\frac{\\cosh(\\lambda x)\\cosh(\\lambda L) - \\sinh(\\lambda L)\\sinh(\\lambda x)}{\\cosh(\\lambda L)} \\right)\n$$\nThe numerator matches the hyperbolic identity $\\cosh(a-b) = \\cosh(a)\\cosh(b) - \\sinh(a)\\sinh(b)$.

The solution simplifies to:\n$$\nc(x) = c_0 \\frac{\\cosh(\\lambda(L-x))}{\\cosh(\\lambda L)}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute back the definition $\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}$ to obtain the final expression for the steady-state concentration profile in terms of the given parameters:\n$$\nc(x) = c_0 \\frac{\\cosh\\left((L-x)\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right)}{\\cosh\\left(L\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right)}\n$$\nThis is the complete, closed-form analytic solution for the concentration profile $c(x)$ on the domain $0 \\le x \\le L$.",
