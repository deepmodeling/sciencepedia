            "problem": "Consider a single horizontal grid cell in a General Circulation Model (GCM), where the unresolved sub-grid variability in surface temperature is represented by a set of categories indexed by $i$, each occupying a fraction $w_i$ of the cell area, with $\\sum_i w_i = 1$. The surface longwave radiative flux from each category follows the Stefan–Boltzmann law, $F_i = \\epsilon \\sigma_{\\mathrm{SB}} T_i^{4}$, where $\\epsilon$ is the emissivity (dimensionless), $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{SB}}$ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant, and $T_i$ is the absolute temperature in kelvins. Starting from the definition of a weighted average and the Stefan–Boltzmann law, derive the grid-cell aggregated flux and compare it to the flux computed using the grid-mean temperature. Using only the definitions of weighted averages, expectations, and the convexity of the function $x^{4}$, show how nonlinear aggregation effects arise and explain why Jensen’s inequality applies in this context.\n\nThen, assume the sub-grid temperature field $T$ can be treated as a continuous random variable that is approximately Gaussian with mean $\\mu_T$ and variance $\\sigma_T^{2}$, and that the probability of non-physical negative values is negligible because $\\mu_T \\gg \\sigma_T$.

Express your final answer for $B$ in watts per square meter. No numerical values are to be substituted; leave all constants and parameters symbolic. The final answer must be a single analytic expression.",
            "solution": "The goal is to start from fundamental definitions and laws to derive the true aggregated flux, compare it with the flux computed at the mean state, and then quantify the bias introduced by neglecting sub-grid variability for a specific nonlinear flux law.\n\nThe Stefan–Boltzmann law states that the longwave radiative flux for a surface at absolute temperature $T$ is $F = \\epsilon \\sigma_{\\mathrm{SB}} T^{4}$, where $\\epsilon$ is the emissivity and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{SB}}$ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant. A grid cell with sub-grid categories indexed by $i$ has temperatures $T_i$ and area fractions $w_i$ satisfying $\\sum_i w_i = 1$.\n\nBy the definition of a weighted average, the true, area-weighted grid-cell flux, denoted $F_{\\mathrm{true}}$, is\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{true}} = \\sum_i w_i F_i = \\sum_i w_i \\left( \\epsilon \\sigma_{\\mathrm{SB}} T_i^{4} \\right) = \\epsilon \\sigma_{\\mathrm{SB}} \\sum_i w_i T_i^{4}.\n$$\nDefine the grid-mean temperature as\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{mean}} = \\sum_i w_i T_i.\n$$\nA mean-state parameterization computes the flux as if the entire grid cell were at the mean temperature, yielding\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{mean}} = \\epsilon \\sigma_{\\mathrm{SB}} \\left( T_{\\mathrm{mean}} \\right)^{4} = \\epsilon \\sigma_{\\mathrm{SB}} \\left( \\sum_i w_i T_i \\right)^{4}.\n$$\n\nTo compare $F_{\\mathrm{true}}$ and $F_{\\mathrm{mean}}$, we appeal to convexity and Jensen’s inequality. The function $x^{4}$ is convex on the positive real line because its second derivative $12 x^{2}$ is nonnegative for all $x$. Jensen’s inequality for a convex function $f$ states that $f\\left( \\sum_i w_i x_i \\right) \\leq \\sum_i w_i f(x_i)$.

This is the discrete, category-based statement of nonlinear aggregation effects.\n\nTo obtain an exact closed-form expression for $B$ under a statistical description of sub-grid variability, model $T$ as a continuous random variable with probability distribution and treat the area weights as probabilities. Then the true flux is\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{true}} = \\epsilon \\sigma_{\\mathrm{SB}} \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[ T^{4} \\right],\n$$\nand the mean-state flux is\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{mean}} = \\epsilon \\sigma_{\\mathrm{SB}} \\left( \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[ T \\right] \\right)^{4}.\n$$\nThe bias becomes\n$$\nB = \\epsilon \\sigma_{\\mathrm{SB}} \\left( \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[ T^{4} \\right] - \\left( \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[ T \\right] \\right)^{4} \\right).\n$$\n\nAssume $T$ is approximately Gaussian, $T \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\!\\left( \\mu_T, \\sigma_T^{2} \\right)$, with $\\mu_T \\gg \\sigma_T$ so that the probability of negative values is negligible.

            "solution": "The task is to implement a time-stepping simulation of a tiled soil moisture model for $N=2$ tiles over a period of $T=5$ days. The model updates the soil moisture storage $S_i(t)$ for each tile $i$ at each daily time step $t$ based on a sequence of physical processes: evapotranspiration, water inputs (precipitation and irrigation), drainage, and overflow. The goal is to compute the total grid-mean evapotranspiration $E_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ over the simulation period and the final grid-mean soil moisture $\\overline{S}(T)$.\n\nThe simulation proceeds by iterating from day $t=0$ to $t=T-1$. At each day $t$, and for each tile $i=1, \\dots, N$:\n\n1.  **Calculate Evapotranspiration ($E_i(t)$)**:\n    First, the soil moisture stress factor, $\\alpha_i$, is determined based on the current soil moisture $S_i(t)$ relative to the tile's wilting point $S_{\\mathrm{wp},i}$ and field capacity $S_{\\mathrm{fc},i}$.\n    $$\n    \\alpha_i(S_i(t)) = \n    \\begin{cases}\n    0, & S_i(t) \\le S_{\\mathrm{wp},i} \\\\\n    \\frac{S_i(t) - S_{\\mathrm{wp},i}}{S_{\\mathrm{fc},i} - S_{\\mathrm{wp},i}}, & S_{\\mathrm{wp},i} < S_i(t) < S_{\\mathrm{fc},i} \\\\\n    1, & S_i(t) \\ge S_{\\mathrm{fc},i}\n    \\end{cases}\n    $$\n    The actual evapotranspiration $E_i(t)$ is then calculated by modulating the potential evapotranspiration $E_0(t)$ with the crop coefficient $K_{c,i}$ and the stress factor $\\alpha_i$.\n    $$\n    E_i(t) = K_{c,i} \\, E_0(t) \\, \\alpha_i(S_i(t))\n    $$\n\n2.  **Calculate Intermediate Storage ($S_i'(t)$)**:\n    An intermediate storage value, $S_i'(t)$, is computed by applying the water balance for the day, accounting for inputs and the ET calculated in the previous step.\n    $$\n    S_i'(t) = S_i(t) + P(t) + I_i(t) - E_i(t)\n    $$\n\n3.  **Calculate Drainage ($D_i(t)$) and Update Storage**:\n    Gravitational drainage $D_i(t)$ occurs only when the intermediate storage $S_i'(t)$ exceeds the field capacity $S_{\\mathrm{fc},i}$. The amount of drainage is proportional to this excess water, governed by the drainage coefficient $k_{d,i}$.\n    $$\n    D_i(t) = k_{d,i} \\, \\max(0, S_i'(t) - S_{\\mathrm{fc},i})\n    $$\n    This drainage is then removed from the intermediate storage to yield a second intermediate value, $S_i''(t)$.\n    $$\n    S_i''(t) = S_i'(t) - D_i(t)\n    $$\n\n4.  **Enforce Physical Limits and Determine Final Storage ($S_i(t+1)$)**:\n    The final step is to ensure the soil moisture for the next day, $S_i(t+1)$, respects the physical boundaries of the soil bucket. The storage cannot be negative, and it cannot exceed the maximum capacity $S_{\\max,i}$.\n    $$\n    S_i(t+1) = \\min(S_{\\max,i}, \\max(0, S_i''(t)))\n    $$\n    Any water in $S_i''(t)$ that exceeds $S_{\\max,i}$ is considered overflow runoff and is implicitly removed by the $\\min$ function.\n\n5.  **Aggregate Outputs**:\n    During each day $t$ of the simulation, the grid-mean evapotranspiration $\\overline{E}(t)$ is calculated by taking the area-weighted average of the tile-specific ET values.\n    $$\n    \\overline{E}(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^N f_i \\, E_i(t)\n    $$\n    This daily value is accumulated over the simulation period to find the total, $E_{\\mathrm{tot}}$.\n    $$\n    E_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\sum_{t=0}^{T-1} \\overline{E}(t)\n    $$\n    After the final time step ($t=T-1$), the final soil moisture values $S_i(T)$ are used to compute the final grid-mean soil moisture $\\overline{S}(T)$.\n    $$\n    \\overline{S}(T) = \\sum_{i=1}^N f_i \\, S_i(T)\n    $$\n\nThis entire procedure is implemented for each of the five test cases provided. The parameters $\\{f_i, S_{\\max,i}, S_{\\mathrm{fc},i}, S_{\\mathrm{wp},i}, k_{d,i}, K_{c,i}\\}$ and initial conditions $S_i(0)$, along with the time series for $E_0(t)$, $P(t)$, and $I_i(t)$, are used as inputs to the simulation for each case. The final computed values of $E_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ and $\\overline{S}(T)$ for each case are rounded to three decimal places.",
