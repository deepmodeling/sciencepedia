            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the phase-space divergence of the vector field governing a two-box Energy Balance Model (EBM), and an interpretation of its sign. The analysis proceeds in three steps: first, expressing the system dynamics in the standard form $\\frac{d\\mathbf{T}}{dt} = \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{T}, t)$; second, calculating the divergence of $\\mathbf{f}$ with respect to the state variables $\\mathbf{T}=(T_1, T_2)$; and third, interpreting the result in the context of dynamical systems theory. No auxiliary assumptions beyond the provided model definition are required.\n\nThe governing equations for the temperature anomalies $T_1$ and $T_2$ are given as:\n$$ C_{1}\\,\\frac{dT_{1}}{dt} \\;=\\; Q_{1}(t) \\;-\\; \\lambda\\,T_{1} \\;-\\; \\kappa\\,(T_{1} - T_{2}) $$\n$$ C_{2}\\,\\frac{dT_{2}}{dt} \\;=\\; Q_{2}(t) \\;+\\; \\kappa\\,(T_{1} - T_{2}) \\;-\\; \\lambda_{2}\\,T_{2} $$\n\nFirst, we write this system in the standard form $\\frac{d\\mathbf{T}}{dt} = \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{T}, t)$, where $\\mathbf{f} = (f_1, f_2)$. This involves isolating the time derivatives $\\frac{dT_1}{dt}$ and $\\frac{dT_2}{dt}$.\n\nFor the first component, $f_1 = \\frac{dT_1}{dt}$, we divide the first equation by the heat capacity $C_1$:\n$$ \\frac{dT_{1}}{dt} = \\frac{1}{C_1} \\left( Q_{1}(t) - \\lambda\\,T_{1} - \\kappa\\,(T_{1} - T_{2}) \\right) $$\nWe can group the terms containing the state variables $T_1$ and $T_2$:\n$$ f_1(T_1, T_2, t) = \\frac{Q_1(t)}{C_1} - \\frac{\\lambda T_1}{C_1} - \\frac{\\kappa T_1}{C_1} + \\frac{\\kappa T_2}{C_1} = - \\left( \\frac{\\lambda + \\kappa}{C_1} \\right) T_1 + \\left( \\frac{\\kappa}{C_1} \\right) T_2 + \\frac{Q_1(t)}{C_1} $$\n\nFor the second component, $f_2 = \\frac{dT_2}{dt}$, we divide the second equation by the heat capacity $C_2$:\n$$ \\frac{dT_{2}}{dt} = \\frac{1}{C_2} \\left( Q_{2}(t) + \\kappa\\,(T_{1} - T_{2}) - \\lambda_{2}\\,T_{2} \\right) $$\nGrouping the terms containing the state variables $T_1$ and $T_2$:\n$$ f_2(T_1, T_2, t) = \\frac{Q_2(t)}{C_2} + \\frac{\\kappa T_1}{C_2} - \\frac{\\kappa T_2}{C_2} - \\frac{\\lambda_2 T_2}{C_2} = \\left( \\frac{\\kappa}{C_2} \\right) T_1 - \\left( \\frac{\\kappa + \\lambda_2}{C_2} \\right) T_2 + \\frac{Q_2(t)}{C_2} $$\n\nNext, we compute the phase-space divergence, which is defined as $\\operatorname{div}\\,\\mathbf{f} = \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial T_1} + \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial T_2}$.\n\nWe calculate the partial derivative of $f_1$ with respect to $T_1$.

The problem states the following physical constraints on the parameters: $C_1 > 0$, $C_2 > 0$, $\\lambda \\ge 0$, $\\lambda_2 \\ge 0$, and $\\kappa \\ge 0$.\nGiven these constraints, let us examine the terms inside the parenthesis:\nThe numerators are $\\lambda + \\kappa \\ge 0$ and $\\lambda_2 + \\kappa \\ge 0$.\nThe denominators $C_1$ and $C_2$ are strictly positive.\nTherefore, each fraction is non-negative:\n$$ \\frac{\\lambda + \\kappa}{C_1} \\ge 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\lambda_2 + \\kappa}{C_2} \\ge 0 $$\nThe sum of these two non-negative terms is also non-negative. Due to the leading negative sign in the expression for the divergence, we have:\n$$ \\operatorname{div}\\,\\mathbf{f} \\le 0 $$\nIn any physically plausible scenario, at least one of the feedback or exchange parameters ($\\lambda, \\lambda_2, \\kappa$) will be strictly positive, representing processes like outgoing longwave radiation or vertical ocean heat transport. For instance, stability requires $\\lambda > 0$. In such cases, the divergence is strictly negative: $\\operatorname{div}\\,\\mathbf{f} < 0$.\n\nAccording to a generalization of Liouville's theorem, the time rate of change of an infinitesimal volume $\\mathcal{V}$ in phase space is governed by the relation $\\frac{1}{\\mathcal{V}} \\frac{d\\mathcal{V}}{dt} = \\operatorname{div}\\,\\mathbf{f}$. Since $\\operatorname{div}\\,\\mathbf{f} \\le 0$, it follows that $\\frac{d\\mathcal{V}}{dt} \\le 0$. This signifies that any volume of initial conditions in the phase space of the system will contract (or at best, remain constant if all dissipative parameters are zero). This volume contraction is the defining mathematical feature of a **dissipative system**. The physical processes modeled by the parameters $\\lambda, \\lambda_2,$ and $\\kappa$ are dissipative in nature, removing energy or redistributing it in a way that corresponds to damping in the state-space dynamics. Trajectories are thus attracted to a subset of the phase space with zero volume, such as a fixed point or a limit cycle, known as an attractor.",

We compute the partial derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f_x}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(\\sigma y - \\sigma x) = -\\sigma \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial f_y}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(rx - y - xz) = -1 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial f_z}{\\partial z} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(xy - bz) = -b\n$$\nSumming these gives the divergence:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{f} = -\\sigma - 1 - b = -(\\sigma + 1 + b).\n$$\nThe divergence is a negative constant, as $\\sigma > 0$ and $b > 0$. From Part 1, this means that any phase-space volume element $\\delta V$ contracts exponentially in time at a uniform rate, independent of its position:\n$$\n\\frac{d(\\delta V)}{dt} = -(\\sigma + 1 + b) \\delta V \\implies \\delta V(t) = \\delta V_0 \\exp(-(\\sigma + 1 + b)t).\n$$\nThis indicates that the system is dissipative. Trajectories are ultimately confined to an attractor, and because all volumes shrink to zero as $t \\to \\infty$, this attractor must have a volume of zero in the three-dimensional phase space. This is a hallmark of a strange attractor, which typically has a fractal structure and a non-integer dimension less than the dimension of the phase space.\n\n### Part 3: Verification and Kaplan–Yorke Dimension\n\nFor the canonical parameters $\\sigma = 10$, $r = 28$, and $b = 8/3$, the theoretical result from Part 1 predicts that the sum of the Lyapunov exponents should be equal to the constant divergence.\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^3 \\lambda_i = \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{f} = -(\\sigma + 1 + b) = -(10 + 1 + \\frac{8}{3}) = -(11 + \\frac{8}{3}) = -(\\frac{33}{3} + \\frac{8}{3}) = -\\frac{41}{3}.\n$$\nThe exact theoretical value is $-\\frac{41}{3}$, which is approximately $-13.6667$.\n\nThe problem provides numerically estimated Lyapunov exponents: $\\lambda_1 = 0.9056$, $\\lambda_2 = 0.0000$, and $\\lambda_3 = -14.5723$. Their sum is:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 + \\lambda_3 = 0.9056 + 0.0000 - 14.5723 = -13.6667.\n$$\nThis numerical value perfectly matches the theoretical prediction, thus verifying the consistency of the results.\n\nNow we estimate the Kaplan–Yorke (KY) dimension, $D_{KY}$. With the Lyapunov exponents ordered as $\\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge \\lambda_n$, the KY dimension is defined as:\n$$\nD_{KY} = j + \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^j \\lambda_i}{|\\lambda_{j+1}|},\n$$\nwhere $j$ is the largest integer such that the sum of the first $j$ exponents is non-negative, $\\sum_{i=1}^j \\lambda_i \\ge 0$.\n\nThe given exponents are already ordered: $\\lambda_1 = 0.9056$, $\\lambda_2 = 0.0000$, $\\lambda_3 = -14.5723$.\nLet's find $j$:\n-   For $j=1$: $\\sum_{i=1}^1 \\lambda_i = \\lambda_1 = 0.9056 \\ge 0$.\n-   For $j=2$: $\\sum_{i=1}^2 \\lambda_i = \\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 = 0.9056 + 0.0000 = 0.9056 \\ge 0$.\n-   For $j=3$: $\\sum_{i=1}^3 \\lambda_i = -13.6667 < 0$.\n\nThe largest integer $j$ for which the partial sum is non-negative is $j=2$. We now apply the formula with $j=2$:\n$$\nD_{KY} = 2 + \\frac{\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2}{|\\lambda_3|} = 2 + \\frac{0.9056 + 0.0000}{|-14.5723|} = 2 + \\frac{0.9056}{14.5723}.\n$$\nCalculating the value:\n$$\nD_{KY} \\approx 2 + 0.0621430... = 2.0621430...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $2.062$.",
