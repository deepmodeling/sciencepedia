Time is treated as continuous (method-of-lines), and the qualitative behavior of forward and central differencing is known from numerical analysis: forward/backward (upwind) differencing introduces artificial diffusion, whereas central differencing introduces leading-order dispersion.\n\nUsing the modified equation analysis for this upwind discretization, treat the scheme as a continuous PDE that augments physical advection with a leading-order artificial process. From this representation, estimate the front broadening after the pulse has advected a downstream distance $L$ by quantifying the $10$–$90$ rise distance, defined as the spatial separation between the locations where $c=0.1$ and $c=0.9$ along the moving front.

This means for a grid of $N$ points indexed $j=0, \\dots, N-1$, the neighbors of point $j=0$ are $j=1$ and $j=N-1$, and the neighbors of $j=N-1$ are $j=0$ and $j=N-2$.\n\nThe primary goal is to compare the numerical approximation to the exact solution. The observed error is defined as the maximum absolute difference on the poleward-most latitude row of the grid, $\\phi_{\\text{pole}}$:\n$$\ne_{\\text{obs}} = \\max_{\\lambda_j} \\left| G_{\\lambda}^{\\text{num}}(\\phi_{\\text{pole}}, \\lambda_j) - G_{\\lambda}^{\\text{exact}}(\\phi_{\\text{pole}}, \\lambda_j) \\right|\n$$\n\nThe second goal is to estimate this error using the leading-order term of the Taylor series truncation error. The leading error of the central difference approximation for the physical gradient is:\n$$\nE_{\\lambda}(\\phi,\\lambda) \\approx \\frac{1}{R \\cos(\\phi)} \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda^2}{6} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial^3 P}{\\partial \\lambda^3}(\\phi,\\lambda)\n$$\nTo evaluate this, we need the third partial derivative of $P$ with respect to $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 P}{\\partial \\lambda^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\lambda} \\left( -A \\sin(\\lambda) - 2C \\cos(\\phi) \\sin(2\\lambda) \\right) = -A \\cos(\\lambda) - 4C \\cos(\\phi) \\cos(2\\lambda)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^3 P}{\\partial \\lambda^3} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\lambda} \\left( -A \\cos(\\lambda) - 4C \\cos(\\phi) \\cos(2\\lambda) \\right) = A \\sin(\\lambda) + 8C \\cos(\\phi) \\sin(2\\lambda)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the error formula gives:\n$$\nE_{\\lambda}(\\phi, \\lambda) \\approx \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda^2}{6 R \\cos(\\phi)} \\left[ A \\sin(\\lambda) + 8C \\cos(\\phi) \\sin(2\\lambda) \\right] = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda^2}{6} \\left[ \\frac{A \\sin(\\lambda)}{R \\cos(\\phi)} + \\frac{8C \\sin(2\\lambda)}{R} \\right]\n$$\nThe estimated maximum error is the maximum absolute value of this expression on the poleward-most latitude row:\n$$\ne_{\\text{est}} = \\max_{\\lambda_j} \\left| E_{\\lambda}(\\phi_{\\text{pole}}, \\lambda_j) \\right|\n$$\n\nThe computational procedure for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Define the grid parameters: poleward latitude $\\phi_{\\text{pole}}$ and longitude spacing $\\Delta \\lambda_{\\text{deg}}$.\n2.  Convert angles to radians: $\\phi_{\\text{pole, rad}} = \\phi_{\\text{pole}} \\cdot \\pi/180$ and $\\Delta \\lambda_{\\text{rad}} = \\Delta \\lambda_{\\text{deg}} \\cdot \\pi/180$.\n3.  Create the longitude grid $\\lambda_j$ for $j=0, \\dots, N-1$, where $N = 360 / \\Delta \\lambda_{\\text{deg}}$.\n4.  At the latitude $\\phi_{\\text{pole, rad}}$, calculate the pressure $P(\\phi_{\\text{pole, rad}}, \\lambda_j)$ for all $\\lambda_j$ on the grid.\n5.  Use periodic indexing (e.g., using `numpy.roll`) to get $P(\\phi_{\\text{pole, rad}}, \\lambda_{j+1})$ and $P(\\phi_{\\text{pole, rad}}, \\lambda_{j-1})$ for each point.\n6.  Compute $G_{\\lambda}^{\\text{num}}$ for all $\\lambda_j$ using the central difference formula.\n7.  Compute $G_{\\lambda}^{\\text{exact}}$ for all $\\lambda_j$ using the analytical formula.\n8.  Compute the observed maximum absolute error, $e_{\\text{obs}}$.\n9.  Compute the estimated leading-order error $E_{\\lambda}$ for all $\\lambda_j$ using its analytical formula.\n10. Compute the estimated maximum absolute error, $e_{\\text{est}}$.\n11. Store the pair $[e_{\\text{obs}}, e_{\\text{est}}]$ for the test case.\nThis procedure is repeated for all four test cases, and the results are aggregated into the final specified format. As latitude $\\phi$ approaches $\\pm 90^\\circ$, the term $\\cos(\\phi)$ approaches $0$, causing the $G_{\\lambda}$ gradient and its associated errors to increase significantly. This behavior is a key aspect of the \"pole problem\" in global climate models and is expected to be reflected in the results.",
