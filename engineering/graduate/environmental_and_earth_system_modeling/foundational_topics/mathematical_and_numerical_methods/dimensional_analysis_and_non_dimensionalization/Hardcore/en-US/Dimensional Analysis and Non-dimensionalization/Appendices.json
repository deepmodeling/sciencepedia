We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe governing advection–diffusion equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + U \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} = D \\frac{\\partial^{2} c}{\\partial x^{2}}\n$$\nTo non-dimensionalize this equation, we introduce dimensionless variables. We are given the characteristic concentration $C_0$ and the characteristic length scale $L$. The problem asks to choose an appropriate time scale. A natural choice for transport problems involving fluid flow is the advective timescale, which represents the time it takes for a fluid parcel to travel the characteristic length $L$ at speed $U$. Let this time scale be $T_A$.\n\nThe characteristic scales are:\n-   Length: $L$\n-   Concentration: $C_0$\n-   Time: $T_A = \\frac{L}{U}$\n\nWe define the following dimensionless variables, denoted with a prime ($'$):\n-   Dimensionless concentration: $c' = \\frac{c}{C_0}$\n-   Dimensionless length: $x' = \\frac{x}{L}$\n-   Dimensionless time: $t' = \\frac{t}{T_A} = \\frac{t U}{L}$\n\nNext, we express the derivatives in the original PDE in terms of these new dimensionless variables using the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial (C_0 c')}{\\partial t} = C_0 \\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial t} = C_0 \\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial t'} \\frac{\\partial t'}{\\partial t} = C_0 \\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial t'} \\left(\\frac{U}{L}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial (C_0 c')}{\\partial x} = C_0 \\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial x} = C_0 \\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial x'} \\frac{\\partial x'}{\\partial x} = C_0 \\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial x'} \\left(\\frac{1}{L}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2} c}{\\partial x^{2}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{C_0}{L} \\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial x'}\\right) = \\frac{C_0}{L} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x'}\\left(\\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial x'}\\right) \\frac{\\partial x'}{\\partial x} = \\frac{C_0}{L} \\frac{\\partial^{2} c'}{\\partial x'^2} \\left(\\frac{1}{L}\\right) = \\frac{C_0}{L^2} \\frac{\\partial^{2} c'}{\\partial x'^2}\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions back into the original PDE:\n$$\nC_0 \\frac{U}{L} \\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial t'} + U \\left(\\frac{C_0}{L} \\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial x'}\\right) = D \\left(\\frac{C_0}{L^2} \\frac{\\partial^{2} c'}{\\partial x'^2}\\right)\n$$\nTo simplify and complete the non-dimensionalization, we divide the entire equation by the group of coefficients from the advection term, $\\frac{C_0 U}{L}$:\n$$\n\\frac{C_0 U/L}{C_0 U/L} \\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial t'} + \\frac{C_0 U/L}{C_0 U/L} \\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial x'} = \\frac{D C_0/L^2}{C_0 U/L} \\frac{\\partial^{2} c'}{\\partial x'^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial t'} + \\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial x'} = \\left(\\frac{D C_0}{L^2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{L}{C_0 U}\\right) \\frac{\\partial^{2} c'}{\\partial x'^2}\n$$\nSimplifying the coefficient on the right-hand side gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial t'} + \\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial x'} = \\frac{D}{UL} \\frac{\\partial^{2} c'}{\\partial x'^2}\n$$\nThe single dimensionless group that appears is the term $\\frac{UL}{D}$. This is the Péclet number, commonly denoted as $\\text{Pe}$.\n$$\n\\text{Pe} = \\frac{UL}{D}\n$$\nThe dimensionless advection-diffusion equation can thus be written as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial t'} + \\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial x'} = \\frac{1}{\\text{Pe}} \\frac{\\partial^{2} c'}{\\partial x'^2}\n$$\nThe Péclet number, $\\text{Pe} = \\frac{UL}{D}$, quantifies the relative strength of advection to diffusion.

The computed Péclet number is $\\text{Pe} = 5 \\times 10^7$, which is a very large number ($\\text{Pe} \\gg 1$). This indicates that the transport process is strongly dominated by advection.\n\nWe can justify this interpretation by comparing the characteristic timescales for advection and diffusion.\nThe characteristic advective timescale, $T_A$, is the time required to transport the substance over the distance $L$ by the mean flow:\n$$\nT_A = \\frac{L}{U} = \\frac{1000\\,\\mathrm{m}}{0.5\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}} = 2000\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe characteristic diffusive timescale, $T_D$, is the time required for the substance to spread over the distance $L$ by molecular diffusion:\n$$\nT_D = \\frac{L^2}{D} = \\frac{(1000\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}{10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}}} = \\frac{10^6\\,\\mathrm{m^2}}{10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}}} = 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe ratio of these two timescales is:\n$$\n\\frac{T_D}{T_A} = \\frac{L^2/D}{L/U} = \\frac{UL}{D} = \\text{Pe}\n$$\nOur computed value of $\\text{Pe} = 5 \\times 10^7$ means that $T_D = (5 \\times 10^7) \\times T_A$. The time required for diffusion to be a significant transport mechanism is over $7$ orders of magnitude larger than the time it takes for advection to transport the pollutant through the entire length of the channel. For this system, a pollutant entering at $x=0$ would be advected past $x=L$ in $2000$ seconds (about $33.3$ minutes), whereas it would take approximately $10^{11}$ seconds (about $3170$ years) for diffusion to spread the pollutant across the same distance. Therefore, on the timescale of advective transport, the effect of diffusion is negligible. The regime is advection-dominated.",

Therefore, the first dimensionless group is:\n$$ \\Pi_1 = \\tau^{1} \\rho_{a}^{-1} U^{-2} z_{0}^{0} = \\frac{\\tau}{\\rho_{a} U^2} $$\n\n**Construction of the second group, $\\Pi_2$ (involving $\\nu_a$):**\nSimilarly, we express $\\Pi_2$ as:\n$$ \\Pi_2 = \\nu_{a}^{1} \\rho_{a}^{d} U^{e} z_{0}^{f} $$\nThe dimensional equation is:\n$$ [\\Pi_2] = (L^2 T^{-1})^{1} (M L^{-3})^{d} (L T^{-1})^{e} (L)^{f} $$\n$$ [\\Pi_2] = M^{d} L^{2-3d+e+f} T^{-1-e} = M^{0} L^{0} T^{0} $$\nThis yields another system of linear equations for the exponents $d, e, f$:\n1.  For Mass ($M$): $d = 0$\n2.  For Time ($T$): $-1 -e = 0 \\implies e = -1$\n3.  For Length ($L$): $2 - 3d + e + f = 0$. Substituting $d = 0$ and $e = -1$:\n    $2 - 3(0) + (-1) + f = 0 \\implies 2 - 1 + f = 0 \\implies 1 + f = 0 \\implies f = -1$\n\nThe exponents are $d=0, e=-1, f=-1$. Therefore, the second dimensionless group is:\n$$ \\Pi_2 = \\nu_{a}^{1} \\rho_{a}^{0} U^{-1} z_{0}^{-1} = \\frac{\\nu_{a}}{U z_{0}} $$\nThe inverse of this group, $\\frac{U z_{0}}{\\nu_{a}}$, is a more conventional form for a Reynolds number. Since any function of a dimensionless group is also dimensionless, we can use this inverse form without loss of generality. Let's redefine $\\Pi_2$ as this standard form:\n$$ \\Pi_2 = \\frac{U z_{0}}{\\nu_{a}} $$\n\nThe minimal set of independent dimensionless groups is $\\left\\{ \\frac{\\tau}{\\rho_{a} U^2}, \\frac{U z_{0}}{\\nu_{a}} \\right\\}$.\n\n**Non-dimensional Functional Dependence**\nThe original functional relationship $\\tau = F(\\rho_{a}, U, z_{0}, \\nu_{a})$ can be rewritten in a dimensionless form as $\\Phi(\\Pi_1, \\Pi_2) = 0$, or more explicitly by solving for the group containing the dependent variable:\n$$ \\Pi_1 = g(\\Pi_2) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\tau}{\\rho_{a} U^2} = g\\left(\\frac{U z_{0}}{\\nu_{a}}\\right) $$\nwhere $g$ is an unknown dimensionless function that must be determined from theory or experiment.\n\n**Physical Interpretation of the $\\pi$ Groups**\n1.  $\\Pi_1 = \\frac{\\tau}{\\rho_{a} U^2}$: This group is a form of **drag coefficient**, often denoted $C_D$. The numerator, $\\tau$, is the turbulent momentum flux (a force per unit area) transferred from the atmosphere to the surface. The denominator, $\\rho_{a} U^2$ (often written as $\\frac{1}{2}\\rho_{a} U^2$), is a measure of the kinetic energy density or dynamic pressure of the mean flow. Therefore, this group represents the ratio of the surface drag to the inertial force of the large-scale wind, quantifying the efficiency of momentum transfer at the air-sea interface. It is sometimes expressed in terms of the friction velocity $u_* = \\sqrt{\\tau/\\rho_{a}}$, in which case $\\Pi_1 = (u_*/U)^2$.\n\n2.  $\\Pi_2 = \\frac{U z_{0}}{\\nu_{a}}$: This group is a **Reynolds number**, specifically the **roughness Reynolds number**, $Re_{z_0}$. A Reynolds number is fundamentally the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces. In this context, it uses the characteristic length scale of the surface roughness, $z_{0}$. This group determines the nature of the flow at the boundary.\n    - If $\\Pi_2 \\ll 1$, the flow is **aerodynamically smooth**. Viscous forces dominate near the surface, and the physical roughness elements are submerged within a viscous sublayer, having little direct effect on the flow structure.\n    - If $\\Pi_2 \\gg 1$, the flow is **fully rough**. Inertial forces dominate, turbulence is generated by form drag around the roughness elements, and the direct effects of viscosity on the total drag become negligible.\n    - The value of $\\Pi_2$ thus characterizes the boundary-layer regime.\n\nThe final set of $\\pi$ groups is presented below.",
