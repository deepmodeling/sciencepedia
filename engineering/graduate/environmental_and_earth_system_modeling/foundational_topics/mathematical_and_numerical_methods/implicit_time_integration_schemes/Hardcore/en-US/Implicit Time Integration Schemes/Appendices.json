There are no scientific or factual unsoundness, contradictions, or ambiguities.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Numerical Solution using Backward Euler Method\nThe given ODE is $y'(t) = \\lambda y(t)$. The backward Euler method is an implicit one-step numerical method for solving ODEs. For an ODE of the form $y'(t) = f(t,y)$, the general formula for advancing the solution from time $t_n$ to $t_{n+1} = t_n + \\Delta t$ is:\n$$y_{n+1} = y_n + \\Delta t \\, f(t_{n+1}, y_{n+1})$$\nIn this problem, the function $f(t,y)$ is given by $f(t,y) = \\lambda y(t)$. Substituting this into the backward Euler formula gives:\n$$y_{n+1} = y_n + \\Delta t (\\lambda y_{n+1})$$\nSince this is an implicit method, we must solve for the unknown $y_{n+1}$:\n$$y_{n+1} - \\lambda \\Delta t y_{n+1} = y_n$$\n$$y_{n+1} (1 - \\lambda \\Delta t) = y_n$$\n$$y_{n+1} = \\frac{y_n}{1 - \\lambda \\Delta t}$$\nWe are asked to compute the first step, $y_1$, starting from the initial condition $y_0$ at $t_0=0$. Setting $n=0$:\n$$y_1 = \\frac{y_0}{1 - \\lambda \\Delta t}$$\nThe problem provides the values $y_0=1$, $\\lambda=-1000$, and $\\Delta t=0.1$. Substituting these values into the equation for $y_1$:\n$$y_1 = \\frac{1}{1 - (-1000)(0.1)} = \\frac{1}{1 - (-100)} = \\frac{1}{1+100} = \\frac{1}{101}$$\n\n### Derivation of the Exact Solution\nThe ODE $y'(t) = \\lambda y(t)$ can be written as $\\frac{dy}{dt} = \\lambda y$. This is a separable differential equation. We can separate the variables $y$ and $t$:\n$$\\frac{dy}{y} = \\lambda \\, dt$$\nIntegrating both sides of the equation:\n$$\\int \\frac{1}{y} \\, dy = \\int \\lambda \\, dt$$\n$$\\ln|y| = \\lambda t + C$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. To solve for $y$, we exponentiate both sides:\n$$|y| = \\exp(\\lambda t + C) = \\exp(C) \\exp(\\lambda t)$$\nLetting $A = \\pm\\exp(C)$, we obtain the general solution:\n$$y(t) = A \\exp(\\lambda t)$$\nTo find the particular solution, we apply the initial condition $y(0)=y_0$:\n$$y(0) = A \\exp(\\lambda \\cdot 0) = A \\exp(0) = A \\cdot 1 = A$$\nThus, the integration constant is $A=y_0$. The exact solution to the IVP is:\n$$y(t) = y_0 \\exp(\\lambda t)$$\nSubstituting the given values $y_0=1$ and $\\lambda=-1000$:\n$$y(t) = 1 \\cdot \\exp(-1000t) = \\exp(-1000t)$$\nWe need to evaluate this exact solution at time $t=\\Delta t=0.1$:\n$$y(\\Delta t) = y(0.1) = \\exp(-1000 \\cdot 0.1) = \\exp(-100)$$\n\n### Calculation of the Absolute Error\nThe absolute one-step error $E$ is defined as $E = |y_1 - y(\\Delta t)|$. Substituting the numerical and exact values we found:\n$$E = \\left| \\frac{1}{101} - \\exp(-100) \\right|$$\nNow, we compute the numerical values.\n$y_1 = \\frac{1}{101} \\approx 0.009900990099...$\nThe value of $y(\\Delta t) = \\exp(-100)$ is an extremely small positive number. Using a calculator, $\\exp(-100) \\approx 3.72 \\times 10^{-44}$.\nThe error is:\n$$E \\approx |0.009900990099 - 3.72 \\times 10^{-44}|$$\nThe term $\\exp(-100)$ is many orders of magnitude smaller than $\\frac{1}{101}$ and its contribution to the error is negligible for the required precision. Therefore, the error is effectively equal to $y_1$:\n$$E \\approx \\frac{1}{101} \\approx 0.009900990099...$$\nThe problem asks for the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\nThe first non-zero digit of $E$ is the $9$ in the thousandths place. The first four significant figures are $9$, $9$, $0$, $0$. The fifth significant figure is $9$. Since $9 \\ge 5$, we round up the fourth significant figure.\nSo, the value $0.00990099...$ rounded to four significant figures is $0.009901$.",

To find the update rule, we must solve this equation for $y_{n+1}$:\n$$\ny_{n+1} - y_n = \\Delta t (-\\alpha y_{n+1} + \\beta)\n$$\n$$\ny_{n+1} - y_n = -\\alpha \\Delta t \\, y_{n+1} + \\beta \\Delta t\n$$\nRearranging the terms to group all $y_{n+1}$ on one side:\n$$\ny_{n+1} + \\alpha \\Delta t \\, y_{n+1} = y_n + \\beta \\Delta t\n$$\nFactoring out $y_{n+1}$:\n$$\ny_{n+1} (1 + \\alpha \\Delta t) = y_n + \\beta \\Delta t\n$$\nFinally, dividing by $(1 + \\alpha \\Delta t)$ yields the explicit expression for $y_{n+1}$:\n$$\ny_{n+1} = \\frac{y_n + \\beta \\Delta t}{1 + \\alpha \\Delta t}\n$$\nThis is the backward Euler update for the given ODE.\n\n**Positivity Preservation Analysis**\n\nWe need to determine the conditions under which $y_{n+1} \\ge 0$ whenever $y_n \\ge 0$. The problem provides the constraints $\\alpha \\ge 0$, $\\beta \\ge 0$, $\\Delta t \\ge 0$, and we assume $y_n \\ge 0$.\n\nLet's analyze the numerator and the denominator of the expression for $y_{n+1}$:\n1.  **Numerator**: $y_n + \\beta \\Delta t$. Since $y_n \\ge 0$, $\\beta \\ge 0$, and $\\Delta t \\ge 0$, the product $\\beta \\Delta t \\ge 0$. The sum of two non-negative numbers, $y_n$ and $\\beta \\Delta t$, must also be non-negative. Thus, the numerator is always greater than or equal to $0$.\n\n2.  **Denominator**: $1 + \\alpha \\Delta t$. Since $\\alpha \\ge 0$ and $\\Delta t \\ge 0$, the product $\\alpha \\Delta t \\ge 0$. Therefore, the denominator is always greater than or equal to $1$. It is strictly positive.\n\nSince $y_{n+1}$ is the ratio of a non-negative number to a strictly positive number, it must be non-negative, $y_{n+1} \\ge 0$. This holds for any choice of step size $\\Delta t \\ge 0$. Therefore, the backward Euler scheme is **unconditionally positive** for this ODE. The implicit treatment of the sink term $(-\\alpha y)$ is what guarantees this property, avoiding the step-size restrictions that would appear in an explicit scheme.\n\n**Minimal Attainable Value of $y_{n+1}$**\n\nWe are asked to find the minimal attainable value of $y_{n+1}$ over all possible non-negative step sizes $\\Delta t \\ge 0$, under the additional assumption that $\\alpha  0$. Let us define a function $g(\\Delta t)$ representing $y_{n+1}$ as a function of $\\Delta t$:\n$$\ng(\\Delta t) = \\frac{y_n + \\beta \\Delta t}{1 + \\alpha \\Delta t}\n$$\nThe domain of this function is $\\Delta t \\in [0, \\infty)$. To find the minimum value, we can analyze the monotonicity of $g(\\Delta t)$ by examining its derivative with respect to $\\Delta t$. Using the quotient rule for differentiation, $[f/h]' = (f'h - fh')/h^2$, we have:\n$$\ng'(\\Delta t) = \\frac{(\\beta)(1 + \\alpha \\Delta t) - (y_n + \\beta \\Delta t)(\\alpha)}{(1 + \\alpha \\Delta t)^2}\n$$\n$$\ng'(\\Delta t) = \\frac{\\beta + \\alpha \\beta \\Delta t - \\alpha y_n - \\alpha \\beta \\Delta t}{(1 + \\alpha \\Delta t)^2}\n$$\n$$\ng'(\\Delta t) = \\frac{\\beta - \\alpha y_n}{(1 + \\alpha \\Delta t)^2}\n$$\nThe denominator $(1 + \\alpha \\Delta t)^2$ is always positive for $\\Delta t \\ge 0$ and $\\alpha  0$. Thus, the sign of the derivative $g'(\\Delta t)$ is determined solely by the sign of the constant numerator, $\\beta - \\alpha y_n$. The term $\\beta/\\alpha$ represents the steady-state solution of the continuous ODE, where $y' = 0$.\n\nWe consider three cases based on the relationship between the initial value $y_n$ and the steady-state value $\\beta/\\alpha$:\n\n*   **Case 1: $y_n  \\beta/\\alpha$**. This implies $\\alpha y_n  \\beta$, so $\\beta - \\alpha y_n  0$. In this case, $g'(\\Delta t)  0$ for all $\\Delta t \\ge 0$. The function $g(\\Delta t)$ is monotonically increasing. The minimum value must occur at the left endpoint of the domain, i.e., at $\\Delta t = 0$.\n    $$\n    g(0) = \\frac{y_n + \\beta(0)}{1 + \\alpha(0)} = y_n\n    $$\n    The minimal value is $y_n$.\n\n*   **Case 2: $y_n  \\beta/\\alpha$**. This implies $\\alpha y_n  \\beta$, so $\\beta - \\alpha y_n  0$. In this case, $g'(\\Delta t)  0$ for all $\\Delta t \\ge 0$. The function $g(\\Delta t)$ is monotonically decreasing. The minimum value is the infimum, which is approached as $\\Delta t \\to \\infty$.\n    $$\n    \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to \\infty} g(\\Delta t) = \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to \\infty} \\frac{y_n + \\beta \\Delta t}{1 + \\alpha \\Delta t} = \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to \\infty} \\frac{y_n/\\Delta t + \\beta}{1/\\Delta t + \\alpha} = \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}\n    $$\n    The minimal value is $\\beta/\\alpha$.\n\n*   **Case 3: $y_n = \\beta/\\alpha$**. This implies $\\alpha y_n = \\beta$, so $\\beta - \\alpha y_n = 0$. In this case, $g'(\\Delta t) = 0$ for all $\\Delta t \\ge 0$. The function $g(\\Delta t)$ is constant. Its value is $g(\\Delta t) = y_n = \\beta/\\alpha$ for all $\\Delta t$. The minimal value is thus $y_n$ (or $\\beta/\\alpha$).\n\nCombining these three cases, the minimal attainable value of $y_{n+1}$ is $y_n$ if $y_n \\le \\beta/\\alpha$, and $\\beta/\\alpha$ if $y_n  \\beta/\\alpha$. This can be expressed compactly using the minimum function.\n\nThe minimal value is $\\min(y_n, \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha})$. This result has a clear physical interpretation: the numerical solution for $y_{n+1}$ is always bounded below by the smaller of the initial state and the system's steady state.",
