It presents a standard derivation in fluid mechanics. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe starting point is the local mass conservation law, also known as the continuity equation, provided in the problem statement:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\left(\\rho \\mathbf{u}\\right) = q_{m}(\\mathbf{x},t)\n$$\nWe apply the assumptions given in the problem.\n\nFirst, we are given that the density is constant, $\\rho(\\mathbf{x},t) = \\rho_{0}$, where $\\rho_{0}$ is a positive constant. This implies that the partial derivative of density with respect to time is zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial \\rho_{0}}{\\partial t} = 0\n$$\nSecond, we are given that there are no volumetric mass sources or sinks within the domain $\\Omega$. This means the source term is zero everywhere:\n$$\nq_{m}(\\mathbf{x},t) = 0\n$$\nSubstituting these two conditions into the continuity equation yields:\n$$\n0 + \\nabla \\cdot \\left(\\rho_{0} \\mathbf{u}\\right) = 0\n$$\nSince $\\rho_{0}$ is a constant, it can be factored out of the divergence operator:\n$$\n\\rho_{0} \\left( \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} \\right) = 0\n$$\nGiven that $\\rho_{0} > 0$, we can divide both sides by $\\rho_{0}$ to obtain the simplified differential form of the mass conservation law for an incompressible fluid:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0\n$$\nThis equation states that the velocity field $\\mathbf{u}$ is solenoidal (divergence-free). This is the local form of the constraint.\n\nTo find the integral constraint on the boundary data, we integrate this local conservation law over the entire fixed domain $\\Omega$:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} \\left( \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} \\right) \\, dV = \\int_{\\Omega} 0 \\, dV\n$$\nThe integral on the right-hand side is clearly zero:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} \\left( \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} \\right) \\, dV = 0\n$$\nTo evaluate the integral on the left-hand side, we apply the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's theorem). This theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux of that field through the closed surface bounding the volume. For a vector field $\\mathbf{u}$ and a domain $\\Omega$ with boundary $\\partial\\Omega$, the theorem states:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} \\left( \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} \\right) \\, dV = \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, dS\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{n}$ is the outward unit normal vector on the boundary surface $\\partial \\Omega$, and $dS$ is the differential surface area element.\n\nBy substituting this result back into our integrated conservation equation, we arrive at the necessary integral constraint on the boundary data:\n$$\n\\int_{\\partial \\Omega} \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, dS = 0\n$$\nThis equation is the mathematical expression of global mass conservation for an incompressible fluid in a closed domain with no internal sources or sinks. It states that the total volumetric flux of the fluid across the boundary $\\partial \\Omega$ must be zero. In other words, the rate at which fluid volume enters the domain must exactly balance the rate at which it leaves.\n\nThe problem explicitly asks for the value of the integral $\\int_{\\partial \\Omega} \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, dS$. As derived from the fundamental principles and the given assumptions, this value is $0$. The physical units of this integral are those of volumetric flow rate (e.g., cubic meters per second), consistent with the problem's request.",

Substituting these into the general solution for $r(t)$:\n$$\nr(t) = \\left(-\\frac{2}{T^3}\\right)t^3 + \\left(\\frac{3}{T^2}\\right)t^2\n$$\nThis is the explicit analytic expression for the optimal ramping function. It can be rewritten as:\n$$\nr(t) = \\frac{3t^2}{T^2} - \\frac{2t^3}{T^3}\n$$\nThis function is a polynomial that satisfies all four boundary conditions and minimizes the integral of its squared second derivative, thus providing the smoothest transition in the sense defined by the problem.",
