            "solution": "The problem is to derive the e-folding timescale for the decay of concentration perturbations in a well-mixed control volume subject to flushing and a first-order reaction. The derivation must start from the Reynolds transport theorem (RTT).\n\nFirst, we perform a validation of the problem statement.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Control volume: Constant volume $V$.\n- Inlet flow rate: $Q$.\n- Outlet flow rate: $Q$.\n- Inflow concentration: Constant $c_{\\mathrm{in}}$.\n- Volumetric reaction rate: $R(c)=-\\lambda c$, with $\\lambda>0$.\n- Fluid is incompressible.\n- Control surface is stationary.\n- Diffusion across the control surface is negligible.\n- Interior is perfectly mixed, so concentration $c(t)$ is spatially uniform.\n- Extensive property is total mass, $M = \\int_{\\mathrm{CV}} c\\,\\mathrm{d}V$.\n- Perturbation from steady-state concentration $c^{\\ast}$ is $\\delta c(t) = c(t) - c^{\\ast}$.\n- Perturbation decay model: $\\delta c(t) = \\delta c(0)\\exp(-t/\\tau)$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem describes a continuously stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) model, a fundamental and widely used concept in chemical engineering and environmental science. The governing equation is derived from the principle of mass conservation, formalized by the Reynolds transport theorem. The first-order decay is a standard representation for many chemical and biological processes. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly defined with all necessary parameters ($V$, $Q$, $c_{\\mathrm{in}}$, $\\lambda$) and conditions (well-mixed, constant volume, etc.). The objective is to find a specific quantity, $\\tau$, which is uniquely determined by the given parameters.\n- **Objective:** The language is formal, precise, and free of subjective content.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe Reynolds Transport Theorem (RTT) provides the governing principle. The extensive property is the total mass of the constituent, $M = \\int_{\\mathrm{CV}} c \\, \\mathrm{d}V$, where $c$ is the mass concentration (mass per unit volume). For a fixed control volume, the RTT states that the rate of change of mass due to internal reactions equals the rate of change of mass stored in the volume plus the net rate of mass flux out of the volume. Mathematically:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{d}M}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\right)_{\\mathrm{reaction}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\int_{\\mathrm{CV}} c \\, \\mathrm{d}V + \\int_{\\mathrm{CS}} c (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) \\, \\mathrm{d}A $$\nThe term on the left-hand side represents the net rate of production of mass due to reactions within the system (or material volume).\n\nLet's evaluate each term based on the problem statement.\n\n1.  **Source/Sink Term (LHS):** The rate of change of mass due to reaction is given by the volumetric rate $R(c) = -\\lambda c$. Integrating over the control volume:\n    $$ \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{d}M}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\right)_{\\mathrm{reaction}} = \\int_{\\mathrm{CV}} R(c) \\, \\mathrm{d}V = \\int_{\\mathrm{CV}} (-\\lambda c) \\, \\mathrm{d}V $$\n    Since the interior is perfectly mixed, $c$ is spatially uniform. Thus, we can take $c$ and $\\lambda$ out of the integral:\n    $$ \\int_{\\mathrm{CV}} (-\\lambda c) \\, \\mathrm{d}V = -\\lambda c \\int_{\\mathrm{CV}} \\mathrm{d}V = -\\lambda c V $$\n\n2.  **Storage Term (first term on RHS):** This is the rate of change of mass stored within the control volume.\n    $$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\int_{\\mathrm{CV}} c \\, \\mathrm{d}V $$\n    Since $c$ is spatially uniform and the volume $V$ is constant:\n    $$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t} (c V) = V \\frac{\\mathrm{d}c}{\\mathrm{d}t} $$\n\n3.  **Flux Term (second term on RHS):** This is the net advective flux of the constituent across the control surface.\n    $$ \\int_{\\mathrm{CS}} c (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) \\, \\mathrm{d}A $$\n    We split the integral over the inlet and outlet surfaces.\n    -   **Outlet:** The fluid exits with concentration $c(t)$ (due to perfect mixing). The velocity vector $\\mathbf{v}$ points outwards, parallel to the outward normal $\\mathbf{n}$, so $\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} > 0$. The integral $\\int_{\\mathrm{out}} (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) \\, \\mathrm{d}A$ is the volumetric flow rate $Q$. The mass flux out is $+c Q$.\n    -   **Inlet:** The fluid enters with concentration $c_{\\mathrm{in}}$. The velocity vector $\\mathbf{v}$ points inwards, opposite to the outward normal $\\mathbf{n}$, so $\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} < 0$. The integral $\\int_{\\mathrm{in}} (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) \\, \\mathrm{d}A$ is equal to $-Q$. The mass flux in is $c_{\\mathrm{in}}(-Q) = -c_{\\mathrm{in}} Q$.\n    The net flux is the sum of the outlet and inlet fluxes: $c Q - c_{\\mathrm{in}} Q$.\n\nSubstituting these terms back into the RTT equation:\n$$ -\\lambda c V = V \\frac{\\mathrm{d}c}{\\mathrm{d}t} + c Q - c_{\\mathrm{in}} Q $$\nRearranging to obtain the ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $c(t)$:\n$$ V \\frac{\\mathrm{d}c}{\\mathrm{d}t} = Q c_{\\mathrm{in}} - Q c - \\lambda V c $$\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}c}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{Q}{V} c_{\\mathrm{in}} - \\left(\\frac{Q}{V} + \\lambda\\right) c $$\nThis is the required scalar balance for $c(t)$.\n\nNext, we find the steady-state concentration $c^{\\ast}$ by setting $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}c}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 0$:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{Q}{V} c_{\\mathrm{in}} - \\left(\\frac{Q}{V} + \\lambda\\right) c^{\\ast} $$\n$$ c^{\\ast} = \\frac{(Q/V) c_{\\mathrm{in}}}{Q/V + \\lambda} = \\frac{Q c_{\\mathrm{in}}}{Q + \\lambda V} $$\n\nNow, we analyze the dynamics of a small perturbation $\\delta c(t) = c(t) - c^{\\ast}$. We substitute $c(t) = c^{\\ast} + \\delta c(t)$ into the ODE:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}(c^{\\ast} + \\delta c) = \\frac{Q}{V} c_{\\mathrm{in}} - \\left(\\frac{Q}{V} + \\lambda\\right) (c^{\\ast} + \\delta c) $$\nSince $c^{\\ast}$ is constant, $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}c^{\\ast}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 0$. The equation for the perturbation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}(\\delta c)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\left[ \\frac{Q}{V} c_{\\mathrm{in}} - \\left(\\frac{Q}{V} + \\lambda\\right) c^{\\ast} \\right] - \\left(\\frac{Q}{V} + \\lambda\\right) \\delta c $$\nThe term in the square brackets is zero by the definition of the steady state $c^{\\ast}$. This leaves a homogeneous ODE for the perturbation:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}(\\delta c)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = - \\left(\\frac{Q}{V} + \\lambda\\right) \\delta c $$\nThe total decay rate of perturbations is the sum of the flushing rate, $\\frac{Q}{V}$ (the inverse of the residence time), and the reaction rate, $\\lambda$. Thus, the linear first-order reaction increases the overall decay rate.\n\nThe solution to this ODE is an exponential decay:\n$$ \\delta c(t) = \\delta c(0) \\exp\\left( -\\left(\\frac{Q}{V} + \\lambda\\right) t \\right) $$\nThe problem defines the e-folding timescale $\\tau$ via the relation $\\delta c(t) = \\delta c(0)\\exp(-t/\\tau)$. By comparing the two forms of the solution, we can identify $\\tau$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\tau} = \\frac{Q}{V} + \\lambda $$\nSolving for $\\tau$ gives the final expression:\n$$ \\tau = \\frac{1}{\\frac{Q}{V} + \\lambda} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{Q + \\lambda V}{V}} = \\frac{V}{Q + \\lambda V} $$\nThis is the closed-form symbolic expression for the e-folding timescale.",

The notation of $w_b(x,t)$ for a function that only depends on $x$ is a minor inconsistency but does not invalidate the problem; it is interpreted as a time-independent seepage velocity. The problem is objective and free of non-formalizable or irrelevant content.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe starting point is the Reynolds Transport Theorem (RTT) for conservation of mass within a fixed control volume (CV) with control surface (CS):\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{CV} \\rho \\, dV + \\oint_{CS} \\rho (\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{n}) \\, dA = 0\n$$\nHere, $\\rho$ is the fluid density, $\\vec{v}$ is the fluid velocity vector, and $\\vec{n}$ is the outward-pointing unit normal vector to the differential surface area $dA$. The first term represents the rate of change of mass within the control volume, and the second term represents the net rate of mass flux out of the control volume.\n\nSince the water is assumed to be incompressible, the density $\\rho$ is constant. It can be factored out of the integrals and canceled, yielding the equation for conservation of volume:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{CV} dV + \\oint_{CS} (\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{n}) \\, dA = 0\n$$\nThe first term, $\\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{CV} dV = \\frac{d\\mathcal{V}}{dt}$, is the rate of change of water volume stored within the river reach. The second term, $\\oint_{CS} (\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{n}) \\, dA$, is the net outward volumetric flux across the control surface, which we denote as $Q_{net,out}$. The problem statement asks for the calculation of this term.\n$$\nQ_{net,out} = \\oint_{CS} (\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{n}) \\, dA\n$$\nThe control surface is closed and consists of four parts: the upstream cross-section ($A_u$ at $x=0$), the downstream cross-section ($A_d$ at $x=L$), the banks ($A_{banks}$), and the river bed ($A_{bed}$). The total flux is the sum of the fluxes through each part:\n$$\nQ_{net,out} = \\int_{A_u} (\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{n}) \\, dA + \\int_{A_d} (\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{n}) \\, dA + \\int_{A_{banks}} (\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{n}) \\, dA + \\int_{A_{bed}} (\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{n}) \\, dA\n$$\nWe evaluate each integral term by term, paying careful attention to the sign conventions.\n1.  **Upstream Flux ($A_u$):** At the upstream boundary ($x=0$), the flow velocity $\\vec{v}$ is in the positive $x$-direction, while the outward normal $\\vec{n}$ is in the negative $x$-direction. Thus, $\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{n}$ is negative. The measured discharge $Q_u(t)$ represents the magnitude of the volumetric flow rate, $\\int_{A_u} |\\vec{v}| dA$. Therefore, the outward flux is:\n    $$ \\int_{A_u} (\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{n}) \\, dA = -Q_u(t) $$\n2.  **Downstream Flux ($A_d$):** At the downstream boundary ($x=L$), both the flow velocity $\\vec{v}$ and the outward normal $\\vec{n}$ are in the positive $x$-direction. Thus, $\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{n}$ is positive. The outward flux is equal to the measured discharge $Q_d(t)$:\n    $$ \\int_{A_d} (\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{n}) \\, dA = Q_d(t) $$\n3.  **Lateral Bank Flux ($A_{banks}$):** The term $q_{\\ell}(x,t)$ is defined as volumetric inflow per unit river length. Since it is an inflow, the velocity vector of the lateral flow points into the control volume, opposite to the outward normal $\\vec{n}$. Hence, the local flux is negative. To find the total flux from the banks, we integrate over the length of the reach:\n    $$ \\int_{A_{banks}} (\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{n}) \\, dA = -\\int_0^L q_{\\ell}(x,t) \\, dx $$\n4.  **Bed Seepage Flux ($A_{bed}$):** The seepage velocity $w_b(x,t)$ is also defined as being directed into the river (inward). Similar to the lateral inflow, the velocity vector is opposite to the outward normal from the bed. The differential area of the bed is $dA = W(x) dx$. The total flux through the bed is found by integrating the local flux $w_b(x,t) W(x)$ over the reach length:\n    $$ \\int_{A_{bed}} (\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{n}) \\, dA = -\\int_0^L w_b(x,t) W(x) \\, dx $$\nCombining these terms gives the expression for the net outward volumetric flux:\n$$\nQ_{net,out}(t) = Q_d(t) - Q_u(t) - \\int_0^L q_{\\ell}(x,t) \\, dx - \\int_0^L w_b(x,t) W(x) \\, dx\n$$\nWe need to evaluate this expression at $t^{\\ast} = 6\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\nFirst, evaluate the time-dependent terms at $t = 6$:\n$Q_u(6) = 120 + 0.05(6) = 120 + 0.3 = 120.3\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,s^{-1}}$\n$Q_d(6) = 135 + 0.02(6) = 135 + 0.12 = 135.12\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,s^{-1}}$\n$q_{\\ell}(x, 6) = 0.04\\,\\exp(-\\frac{x}{200})\\,\\sin(\\frac{6\\pi}{12}) = 0.04\\,\\exp(-\\frac{x}{200})\\,\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = 0.04\\,\\exp(-\\frac{x}{200})$\nThe seepage velocity $w_b$ does not depend on time.\n\nNext, we calculate the integrals.\nThe total lateral inflow from the banks is:\n$$\nI_{\\ell} = \\int_0^L q_{\\ell}(x, 6) \\, dx = \\int_0^{500} 0.04\\,\\exp(-\\frac{x}{200}) \\, dx\n$$\n$$\nI_{\\ell} = 0.04 \\left[ -200\\,\\exp(-\\frac{x}{200}) \\right]_0^{500} = -8 \\left[ \\exp(-\\frac{500}{200}) - \\exp(0) \\right] = -8 \\left[ \\exp(-2.5) - 1 \\right] = 8(1 - \\exp(-2.5))\n$$\nUsing $\\exp(-2.5) \\approx 0.082085$, we get:\n$I_{\\ell} \\approx 8(1 - 0.082085) = 8(0.917915) = 7.34332\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,s^{-1}}$.\n\nThe total seepage inflow from the bed is:\n$$\nI_b = \\int_0^L w_b(x,t) W(x) \\, dx = \\int_0^{500} 10^{-6}\\left(1 + 0.5\\,\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\right) \\left(30 + 5\\,\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\right) \\, dx\n$$\nLet's expand the integrand:\n$10^{-6} \\left( 30 + 5\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) + 15\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) + 2.5\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\right)$\nUsing the identity $\\sin(2\\theta) = 2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)$, the last term is $1.25\\sin(\\frac{4\\pi x}{L})$.\nThe integral becomes:\n$$\nI_b = 10^{-6} \\int_0^L \\left( 30 + 5\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) + 15\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) + 1.25\\sin\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\right) \\, dx\n$$\nThe integrals of $\\sin(kx)$ and $\\cos(kx)$ over an integer number of periods are zero.

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the uniform interfacial entrainment velocity, $e$, in a salt-wedge estuary segment. The solution is obtained by applying the principle of conservation of salt mass to a control volume encompassing the upper, brackish layer of the estuary segment. The governing equation is the Reynolds Transport Theorem (RTT).\n\nThe Reynolds Transport Theorem for any extensive property $B$, with its corresponding property density per unit volume $\\beta = C$, states that the rate of change of $B$ for a material system is equal to the rate of change of $B$ within a control volume (CV) plus the net flux of $B$ out of the control volume across the control surface (CS). The RTT for salt mass conservation is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{D(M_s)_{sys}}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\int_{CV} C \\, dV + \\int_{CS} C (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) \\, dA $$\nHere, $\\mathbf{v}$ is the fluid velocity vector and $\\mathbf{n}$ is the outward-pointing unit normal vector to the control surface element $dA$.\n\nThe principle of conservation of mass states that for a passive scalar like salt with no internal sources or sinks, the total amount in a material system is constant, so $\\frac{D(M_s)_{sys}}{Dt} = 0$.\n\nThe problem specifies a control volume corresponding to the upper layer of the estuary segment, bounded by the vertical planes at $x=0$ and $x=L$, the estuary's lateral walls, the free surface, and the halocline interface. We are given that the flow is steady, so the time-derivative term is zero:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\int_{CV} C \\, dV = 0 $$\nThe RTT simplifies to the statement that the net flux of salt across the control surface is zero:\n$$ \\int_{CS} C (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) \\, dA = 0 $$\nThe control surface CS consists of five parts:\n1.  The upstream inlet surface at $x=0$.\n2.  The downstream outlet surface at $x=L$.\n3.  The free surface.\n4.  The lateral walls.\n5.  The halocline interface.\n\nWe evaluate the flux term for each part:\n-   **Free Surface and Lateral Walls**: The problem states to neglect surface fluxes, and the walls are impermeable. Thus, there is no mass flux across these surfaces, and their contribution to the integral is zero.\n-   **Upstream Inlet ($x=0$)**: The flow is into the CV. The outward normal is $\\mathbf{n} = -\\mathbf{i}$. The velocity is $\\mathbf{v} = U_u(0)\\mathbf{i}$. The area is $A_u(0) = W h_u(0)$. The properties $C_u(0)$ and $U_u(0)$ are uniform over the cross-section. The flux is:\n    $$ \\int_{A(0)} C (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) \\, dA = C_u(0) (U_u(0)\\mathbf{i} \\cdot (-\\mathbf{i})) A_u(0) = -C_u(0) U_u(0) W h_u(0) $$\n-   **Downstream Outlet ($x=L$)**: The flow is out of the CV. The outward normal is $\\mathbf{n} = \\mathbf{i}$. The velocity is $\\mathbf{v} = U_u(L)\\mathbf{i}$. The area is $A_u(L) = W h_u(L)$. The properties $C_u(L)$ and $U_u(L)$ are uniform over the cross-section. The flux is:\n    $$ \\int_{A(L)} C (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) \\, dA = C_u(L) (U_u(L)\\mathbf{i} \\cdot \\mathbf{i}) A_u(L) = C_u(L) U_u(L) W h_u(L) $$\n-   **Halocline Interface**: The problem defines an entrainment velocity $e$ as the normal volumetric flux per unit area from the lower layer into the upper layer. This represents a mass flux *into* the upper-layer CV. The fluid being entrained has the salt concentration of the lower layer, $C_\\ell$. The velocity of this entrained fluid, $\\mathbf{v}_e$, is directed into the upper-layer CV. The outward normal $\\mathbf{n}$ of the upper-layer CV points out of it, i.e., into the lower layer. Therefore, the dot product $\\mathbf{v}_e \\cdot \\mathbf{n}$ is negative, and its magnitude is the entrainment velocity $e$. The total salt flux across the interface is evaluated with the concentration of the fluid crossing the boundary, $C_\\ell$. In the RTT formulation, which calculates net outflow, this term is negative. The interfacial area is $A_{interface} = L W$. The flux term is:\n    $$ \\int_{A_{interface}} C (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) \\, dA = \\int_{A_{interface}} C_\\ell (-e) \\, dA = -e C_\\ell L W $$\n    This term represents the integrated effect of the local jump condition for salt flux at the halocline. The jump condition states that there is a one-way flux of salt of magnitude $e C_\\ell$ per unit area into the upper layer.\n\nSumming all the flux contributions must yield zero:\n$$ -C_u(0) U_u(0) W h_u(0) + C_u(L) U_u(L) W h_u(L) - e C_\\ell L W = 0 $$\nThis is the integral salt budget for the upper-layer control volume. We can solve this equation for the entrainment velocity $e$. The width $W$ is common to all terms and can be cancelled.\n$$ e C_\\ell L = C_u(L) U_u(L) h_u(L) - C_u(0) U_u(0) h_u(0) $$\n$$ e = \\frac{C_u(L) U_u(L) h_u(L) - C_u(0) U_u(0) h_u(0)}{C_\\ell L} $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression.\nGiven:\n-   $C_u(L) = 7.2 \\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$\n-   $U_u(L) = 0.5 \\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$\n-   $h_u(L) = 6 \\,\\mathrm{m}$\n-   $C_u(0) = 0 \\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$\n-   $U_u(0) = 0.6 \\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$\n-   $h_u(0) = 4 \\,\\mathrm{m}$\n-   $C_\\ell = 36 \\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$\n-   $L = 5{,}000 \\,\\mathrm{m}$\n\nThe second term in the numerator is zero because the incoming freshwater has zero salt concentration, $C_u(0) = 0$.\n$$ e = \\frac{C_u(L) U_u(L) h_u(L)}{C_\\ell L} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ e = \\frac{(7.2 \\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}) \\times (0.5 \\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}) \\times (6 \\,\\mathrm{m})}{(36 \\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}) \\times (5{,}000 \\,\\mathrm{m})} $$\n$$ e = \\frac{21.6 \\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}}{180{,}000 \\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-2}}} $$\n$$ e = 0.00012 \\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}} $$\nIn scientific notation, this is $1.2 \\times 10^{-4} \\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ e = 1.200 \\times 10^{-4} \\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}} $$\n\nAs a consistency check, we can formulate a volume conservation budget for the upper layer. The change in volume transport in the upper layer must be balanced by the volume entrained from the lower layer.\n$$ U_u(L) A_u(L) - U_u(0) A_u(0) = e A_{interface} $$\n$$ U_u(L) W h_u(L) - U_u(0) W h_u(0) = e L W $$\n$$ e = \\frac{U_u(L) h_u(L) - U_u(0) h_u(0)}{L} $$\n$$ e = \\frac{(0.5 \\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}})(6 \\,\\mathrm{m}) - (0.6 \\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}})(4 \\,\\mathrm{m})}{5{,}000 \\,\\mathrm{m}} $$\n$$ e = \\frac{3.0 \\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}} - 2.4 \\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}}{5{,}000 \\,\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{0.6 \\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}}{5{,}000 \\,\\mathrm{m}} = 0.00012 \\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}} $$\nThis result is identical to the one obtained from the salt budget, confirming the internal consistency of the problem statement and the correctness of the derivation.",
