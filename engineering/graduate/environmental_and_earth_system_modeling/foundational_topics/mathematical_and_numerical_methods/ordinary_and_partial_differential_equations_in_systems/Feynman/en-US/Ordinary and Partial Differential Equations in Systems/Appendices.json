The unique classical solution for $u(x,t)$ is to be expressed in terms of $f$, $x$, $t$, and $a$.\n\n**Step 2: Validation of Givens**\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The problem describes one-dimensional advection, a fundamental concept in fluid dynamics and transport modeling. The model, defined by the conservation of a passive scalar in a constant velocity field, is a canonical starting point for studying transport phenomena. It is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem is a Cauchy problem for a first-order linear hyperbolic PDE with a constant coefficient and a well-behaved initial condition ($f$ is \"sufficiently smooth\").

The setup is complete and internally consistent.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. The solution process may proceed.\n\n**Derivation of the Governing Partial Differential Equation**\n\nThe principle of conservation for a passive, conservative tracer states that the concentration of the tracer remains constant for an observer moving with the flow. This is equivalent to stating that the material derivative of the concentration is zero, as there are no sources or sinks.\n\nThe material derivative, denoted $\\frac{D}{Dt}$, measures the rate of change of a quantity (in this case, concentration $u$) following a fluid parcel. It is defined as the sum of the local rate of change and the advective rate of change.\nIn a general setting, for a scalar field $u(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ and a velocity field $\\mathbf{v}$, the material derivative is:\n$$ \\frac{Du}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla u $$\nIn our one-dimensional case, the position is $x$, the velocity field is the constant $a$, so $\\mathbf{v} = a \\mathbf{\\hat{i}}$, and the gradient operator is $\\nabla = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\mathbf{\\hat{i}}$. The expression for the material derivative simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{Du}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + a \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} $$\nSince the tracer is conservative (its total amount is conserved) and passive (it doesn't affect the flow), and there are no sources or sinks, its concentration does not change along a fluid parcel's trajectory. Therefore, its material derivative must be zero:\n$$ \\frac{Du}{Dt} = 0 $$\nCombining these equations yields the governing partial differential equation for $u(x,t)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + a \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0 $$\nThis is the one-dimensional linear advection equation.\n\n**Solution of the Initial Value Problem by the Method of Characteristics**\n\nWe must solve the following initial value problem (IVP):\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + a \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0, \\quad \\text{for } x \\in \\mathbb{R}, t > 0 $$\n$$ u(x,0) = f(x), \\quad \\text{for } x \\in \\mathbb{R} $$\n\nThe method of characteristics transforms the PDE into a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) along specific curves in the $(x,t)$-plane, known as characteristic curves. Let's parameterize a characteristic curve by a parameter $s$, such that $x = x(s)$ and $t = t(s)$. Let $U(s) = u(x(s), t(s))$ be the value of the concentration along this curve.\n\nUsing the chain rule, the rate of change of $U$ with respect to $s$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dU}{ds} = \\frac{du}{ds} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\\frac{dx}{ds} + \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}\\frac{dt}{ds} $$\nWe can simplify the parametrization by choosing $s = t$. This implies $\\frac{dt}{ds} = 1$. The equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{du}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\\frac{dx}{dt} + \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} $$\nNow, we compare this expression with the governing PDE, $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + a \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0$. By matching the terms, we can establish the system of characteristic ODEs:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = a $$\n$$ \\frac{du}{dt} = 0 $$\nThe second ODE, $\\frac{du}{dt} = 0$, implies that the concentration $u$ is constant along the characteristic curves.\n\nThe first ODE, $\\frac{dx}{dt} = a$, defines the characteristic curves themselves. We can solve this ODE by direct integration. Let a characteristic curve pass through an arbitrary point $(x, t)$ and originate from a point $(x_0, 0)$ on the initial line ($t=0$). Integrating from $t'=0$ to $t'=t$:\n$$ \\int_{x_0}^{x} dx' = \\int_{0}^{t} a \\, dt' $$\n$$ x - x_0 = a t $$\nThis gives the equation for the characteristic lines: $x = x_0 + at$. Equivalently, the initial position $x_0$ of the characteristic curve passing through $(x,t)$ is given by:\n$$ x_0 = x - at $$\nSince $u$ is constant along each characteristic curve, its value at any point $(x,t)$ on the curve must be equal to its value at the starting point $(x_0, 0)$ of that curve.\n$$ u(x,t) = u(x_0, 0) $$\nThe initial condition states that $u(x_0, 0) = f(x_0)$. Therefore:\n$$ u(x,t) = f(x_0) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $x_0$ in terms of $x$ and $t$, we obtain the unique classical solution to the initial value problem:\n$$ u(x,t) = f(x - at) $$\nThis solution represents the initial profile $f(x)$ translating in the positive $x$-direction with speed $a$ if $a>0$, or in the negative $x$-direction with speed $|a|$ if $a0$, without changing its shape.",

In this regime, the system behaves almost like a pure advection system.\n\n2.  $Pe \\ll 1$: This corresponds to $UL/D \\ll 1$, which means diffusion dominates advection over the scale $L$. A tracer patch will spread out and homogenize over the length scale $L$ much faster than its center of mass is transported downstream. The tracer is mixed very efficiently, and its concentration gradients are quickly smoothed out.

For a spatial discretization of a PDE, the matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ represents the discrete spatial operator. The eigenvalues of this operator determine the stability.\n\nFor many physical processes like diffusion and first-order decay, the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are real and negative.

Combined Critical Time Step and Conclusion**\nTo guarantee stability for the complete advection-diffusion-reaction system using a fully explicit method, the time step $\\Delta t$ must satisfy all three derived constraints simultaneously. A conservative estimate for the critical time step, $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, is therefore the minimum of the individual limits:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\min(\\Delta t_{\\text{adv}}, \\Delta t_{\\text{diff}}, \\Delta t_{\\text{react}}).\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\min(10\\,\\mathrm{s}, 2.5\\,\\mathrm{s}, 20000\\,\\mathrm{s}) = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{s}.\n$$\nThe stability of the explicit scheme is most severely limited by the diffusion process for ammonium, due to the combination of a relatively large diffusion coefficient and the grid spacing squared term.\n\nThe proposed time step is $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{giv}} = 30\\,\\mathrm{s}$. Since $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{giv}} = 30\\,\\mathrm{s} > \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{s}$, the proposed time step is far too large for this explicit scheme and would lead to numerical instability. Consequently, to use a time step of $30\\,\\mathrm{s}$, the modeler would need to switch to an implicit or semi-implicit integration method, which are not subject to such restrictive stability constraints.\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical value of the conservative critical explicit time step $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 2.500\\,\\mathrm{s}.\n$$",
