A passive tracer with concentration $c(x,t)$ is transported by advection with constant velocity $u$ (assumed spatially uniform) and diffuses with constant molecular diffusivity $K$ (assumed spatially uniform). The governing conservation law is the advection-diffusion Partial Differential Equation (PDE)\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial (A\\,c)}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = 0,\n$$\nwhere the total flux $F(x,t)$ combines advective and diffusive contributions,\n$$\nF(x,t) = A\\big(u\\,c(x,t) - K\\,\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}(x,t)\\big).\n$$\nAssume that the initial condition at time $t=0$ is a linear concentration profile $c(x,0) = c_0 + \\alpha\\,x$ on the closed interval $x\\in[0,L]$, with Dirichlet boundary conditions $c(0,t)=c_L$ and $c(L,t)=c_R$ that are consistent with the linear profile, namely $c_L = c_0$ and $c_R = c_0 + \\alpha\\,L$.

At each boundary, approximate the spatial gradient $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}$ using a second-order one-sided difference based only on values at the boundary node and its nearest interior neighbors. Use the Dirichlet boundary values for $c(0)$ and $c(L)$ in the advective contribution. From first principles via Taylor series expansion, derive the second-order one-sided difference formulas for $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}$ at $x=0$ and $x=L$, and use these to approximate $F(0)$ and $F(L)$ at $t=0$.\n\n2.

Evaluate the boundary face fluxes using:\n   - An upwind reconstruction for the advective flux at the boundary face:\n     - At $x=0$, if $u>0$ use the boundary inflow value $c_L$ at the face; if $u<0$ use the adjacent interior cell-center value $c_0$.\n     - At $x=L$, if $u>0$ use the adjacent interior cell-center value $c_{N-1}$; if $u<0$ use the boundary inflow value $c_R$.\n   - A linear reconstruction for the diffusive flux gradient at the boundary face based on the Dirichlet boundary value and the adjacent interior cell-center value, consistent with Fick's law.

The initial concentration profile is $c(x,0) = c_0 + \\alpha x$. The exact spatial gradient at $t=0$ is constant throughout the domain: $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}(x,0) = \\alpha$.\nThe exact boundary fluxes at $t=0$ are:\n$F(0,0) = A(u\\,c(0,0) - K\\,\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}|_{x=0}) = A(u\\,c_0 - K\\,\\alpha)$.\n$F(L,0) = A(u\\,c(L,0) - K\\,\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}|_{x=L}) = A(u\\,(c_0 + \\alpha L) - K\\,\\alpha)$.\nThe exact net rate of mass change due to boundary fluxes is:\n$\\dot{M}_{\\text{exact}} = F(0,0) - F(L,0) = A(u\\,c_0 - K\\,\\alpha) - A(u\\,(c_0+\\alpha L) - K\\,\\alpha) = A(u c_0 - K\\alpha - u c_0 - u\\alpha L + K\\alpha) = -A u \\alpha L$.\n\n**1. Finite Difference (FD) Method**\n\nThe FD method uses a node-based grid with $N+1$ nodes $x_j = j\\,\\Delta x$ for $j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N\\}$, where $\\Delta x = L/N$. The nodal concentrations at $t=0$ are $c_j = c(x_j,0) = c_0 + \\alpha x_j = c_0 + \\alpha j \\Delta x$. The boundary values are $c_0 = c_L$ and $c_N = c_R$.\n\nWe must derive second-order one-sided finite difference formulas for the gradient $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}$ at the boundaries.\n\nAt the left boundary, $x=x_0=0$, we use the nodes $x_0$, $x_1$, and $x_2$. The Taylor series expansions of $c(x)$ around $x_0$ are:\n$c(x_1) = c(x_0+\\Delta x) = c_0 + \\Delta x \\left(\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\right)_0 + \\frac{\\Delta x^2}{2} \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2}\\right)_0 + O(\\Delta x^3)$\n$c(x_2) = c(x_0+2\\Delta x) = c_0 + 2\\Delta x \\left(\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\right)_0 + \\frac{(2\\Delta x)^2}{2} \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2}\\right)_0 + O(\\Delta x^3)$\nTo eliminate the second derivative term, we compute $4c(x_1) - c(x_2)$:\n$4c(x_1) - c(x_2) = (4c_0 + 4\\Delta x (\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x})_0 + 2\\Delta x^2 (\\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2})_0) - (c_0 + 2\\Delta x (\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x})_0 + 2\\Delta x^2 (\\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2})_0) + O(\\Delta x^3)$\n$4c(x_1) - c(x_2) = 3c_0 + 2\\Delta x \\left(\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\right)_0 + O(\\Delta x^3)$\nSolving for the gradient gives the second-order forward difference formula:\n$\\left(\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\right)_{x=0, \\text{FD}} = \\frac{-3c(x_0,0) + 4c(x_1,0) - c(x_2,0)}{2\\Delta x} + O(\\Delta x^2)$.\n\nAt the right boundary, $x=x_N=L$, we use nodes $x_N$, $x_{N-1}$, and $x_{N-2}$. By a similar Taylor expansion around $x_N$, we derive the second-order backward difference formula:\n$\\left(\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\right)_{x=L, \\text{FD}} = \\frac{3c(x_N,0) - 4c(x_{N-1},0) + c(x_{N-2},0)}{2\\Delta x} + O(\\Delta x^2)$.\n\nFor the initial linear profile $c(x,0) = c_0 + \\alpha x$, let's evaluate these gradient approximations:\nAt $x=0$: $c(x_0,0)=c_0$, $c(x_1,0)=c_0+\\alpha\\Delta x$, $c(x_2,0)=c_0+2\\alpha\\Delta x$.\n$\\left(\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\right)_{x=0, \\text{FD}} = \\frac{-3c_0 + 4(c_0+\\alpha\\Delta x) - (c_0+2\\alpha\\Delta x)}{2\\Delta x} = \\frac{(-3+4-1)c_0 + (4\\alpha-2\\alpha)\\Delta x}{2\\Delta x} = \\frac{2\\alpha\\Delta x}{2\\Delta x} = \\alpha$.\nThe approximation is exact because a second-order formula is exact for polynomials of degree up to $2$.\n\nAt $x=L$: $c(x_N,0)=c_0+\\alpha L$, $c(x_{N-1},0)=c_0+\\alpha(L-\\Delta x)$, $c(x_{N-2},0)=c_0+\\alpha(L-2\\Delta x)$.\n$\\left(\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\right)_{x=L, \\text{FD}} = \\frac{3(c_0+\\alpha L) - 4(c_0+\\alpha(L-\\Delta x)) + (c_0+\\alpha(L-2\\Delta x))}{2\\Delta x} = \\frac{(3-4+1)(c_0+\\alpha L) + (4\\alpha-2\\alpha)\\Delta x}{2\\Delta x} = \\frac{2\\alpha\\Delta x}{2\\Delta x} = \\alpha$.\nThe approximation is again exact.\n\nThe boundary fluxes at $t=0$ for the FD method are:\n$F_{\\text{FD}}(0,0) = A(u\\,c(0,0) - K\\,\\left(\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\right)_{x=0, \\text{FD}}) = A(u\\,c_0 - K\\,\\alpha)$.\n$F_{\\text{FD}}(L,0) = A(u\\,c(L,0) - K\\,\\left(\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\right)_{x=L, \\text{FD}}) = A(u\\,(c_0+\\alpha L) - K\\,\\alpha)$.\nThe net rate of mass change is:\n$\\dot{M}_{\\text{FD}} = F_{\\text{FD}}(0,0) - F_{\\text{FD}}(L,0) = A(u\\,c_0-K\\alpha) - A(u(c_0+\\alpha L)-K\\alpha) = -A u \\alpha L$.\nThis is identical to the analytical result.\n\n**2. Finite Volume (FV) Method**\n\nThe FV method uses a cell-centered grid of $N$ cells, where cell $i$ has width $\\Delta x = L/N$ and center $x_i = (i+1/2)\\Delta x$ for $i \\in \\{0, \\dots, N-1\\}$. The domain boundaries are cell faces at $x=0$ and $x=L$. The cell-averaged concentration at $t=0$ for cell $i$ is:\n$c_i = \\frac{1}{\\Delta x}\\int_{i\\Delta x}^{(i+1)\\Delta x} (c_0+\\alpha x)dx = c_0 + \\alpha (i+1/2)\\Delta x = c(x_i, 0)$.\nThe cell-averaged value is equal to the value at the cell center for a linear profile.\n\nThe total flux at a face is the sum of advective and diffusive fluxes, $F = F_{adv} + F_{diff}$. We evaluate these at the boundary faces $x=0$ and $x=L$.\n\nThe diffusive flux $F_{diff} = -A K \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}$ requires a gradient approximation at the faces. The problem specifies a linear reconstruction between the boundary and the nearest cell center.\nAt the left face $x=0$, the gradient is approximated using the boundary value $c_L=c_0$ at $x=0$ and the cell-center value $c_{cell,0}$ at $x_{cell,0}=\\Delta x/2$.\n$c_{cell,0} = c_0 + \\alpha (\\Delta x/2)$.\n$\\left(\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\right)_{x=0, \\text{FV}} = \\frac{c_{cell,0} - c_L}{x_{cell,0} - 0} = \\frac{(c_0+\\alpha\\Delta x/2) - c_0}{\\Delta x/2} = \\alpha$.\nAt the right face $x=L$, the gradient uses the boundary value $c_R=c_0+\\alpha L$ at $x=L$ and the cell-center value $c_{cell,N-1}$ at $x_{cell,N-1}=L-\\Delta x/2$.\n$c_{cell,N-1} = c_0 + \\alpha(L-\\Delta x/2)$.\n$\\left(\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\right)_{x=L, \\text{FV}} = \\frac{c_R - c_{cell,N-1}}{L - x_{cell,N-1}} = \\frac{(c_0+\\alpha L) - (c_0+\\alpha(L-\\Delta x/2))}{\\Delta x/2} = \\alpha$.\nFor the linear initial profile, the diffusive flux gradient approximation is exact for the FV method.\n\nThe advective flux $F_{adv} = A u c_{face}$ uses an upwind scheme for the concentration $c_{face}$ at the face.\nAt the left face $x=0$:\nIf $u \\ge 0$ (inflow from boundary), $c_{face,0} = c_L = c_0$.\nIf $u < 0$ (outflow from domain), $c_{face,0} = c_{cell,0} = c_0 + \\alpha \\Delta x/2$.\nAt the right face $x=L$:\nIf $u > 0$ (outflow from domain), $c_{face,L} = c_{cell,N-1} = c_0 + \\alpha(L - \\Delta x/2)$.\nIf $u \\le 0$ (inflow from boundary), $c_{face,L} = c_R = c_0 + \\alpha L$.\n\nThe total boundary fluxes at $t=0$ for the FV method are:\n$F_{\\text{FV}}(0,0) = A(u\\,c_{face,0} - K\\,\\alpha)$.\n$F_{\\text{FV}}(L,0) = A(u\\,c_{face,L} - K\\,\\alpha)$.\nThe net rate of mass change is:\n$\\dot{M}_{\\text{FV}} = F_{\\text{FV}}(0,0) - F_{\\text{FV}}(L,0) = A u (c_{face,0} - c_{face,L})$.\n\nWe analyze this based on the sign of $u$:\nCase $u > 0$: $\\dot{M}_{\\text{FV}} = A u (c_L - c_{cell,N-1}) = A u (c_0 - (c_0 + \\alpha(L - \\Delta x/2))) = -A u \\alpha(L - \\Delta x/2)$.\nCase $u < 0$: $\\dot{M}_{\\text{FV}} = A u (c_{cell,0} - c_R) = A u ((c_0 + \\alpha \\Delta x/2) - (c_0 + \\alpha L)) = A u \\alpha(\\Delta x/2 - L) = -A u \\alpha(L - \\Delta x/2)$.\nCase $u = 0$: $\\dot{M}_{\\text{FV}} = 0$.\n\nAll cases are described by the single formula, substituting $\\Delta x = L/N$:\n$\\dot{M}_{\\text{FV}} = -A u \\alpha (L - \\frac{\\Delta x}{2}) = -A u \\alpha L (1 - \\frac{1}{2N})$.\nThis result differs from the exact solution due to the first-order upwind approximation for the advective flux term. The error is proportional to $1/N$ and vanishes as $N \\to \\infty$.\n\n**Summary of Formulas for Implementation**\nGiven $A=1\\,\\text{m}^2$.\nFor the Finite Difference method:\n$\\dot{M}_{\\text{FD}} = -u \\alpha L$\nFor the Finite Volume method:\n$\\dot{M}_{\\text{FV}} = -u \\alpha L (1 - \\frac{1}{2N})$\n\nThese formulas will be used to compute the results for the given test cases.",

            "solution": "The problem is to find the amplitude of the long-time periodic volumetric Darcy flux per unit width, $q(x,t)$, at a location $x=L$ in a semi-infinite confined aquifer. The derivation must start from fundamental principles.\n\nFirst, we establish the governing partial differential equation for the hydraulic head, $h(x,t)$. The two fundamental laws provided are mass conservation for a confined aquifer and Darcy's law. In one dimension, mass conservation is expressed as:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\partial q(x,t)}{\\partial x} = S \\frac{\\partial h(x,t)}{\\partial t}\n$$\nwhere $q(x,t)$ is the volumetric Darcy flux per unit width and $S$ is the storativity. This equation states that the net rate of fluid flow into a control volume equals the rate of change of fluid stored within that volume.\n\nDarcy's law, as given in the problem statement, relates the flux to the gradient of the hydraulic head:\n$$\nq(x,t) = -T \\frac{\\partial h(x,t)}{\\partial x}\n$$\nwhere $T$ is the transmissivity of the aquifer.\n\nTo obtain a single equation for $h(x,t)$, we substitute Darcy's law into the mass conservation equation.\n$$\n-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(-T \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x}\\right) = S \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t}\n$$\nGiven that the transmissivity $T$ is uniform and constant, it can be moved outside the spatial derivative:\n$$\nT \\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial x^2} = S \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t}\n$$\nRearranging this gives the one-dimensional diffusion equation for hydraulic head:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nwhere $D = T/S$ is the hydraulic diffusivity.\n\nThe problem asks for the long-time periodic response to the tidal forcing at the boundary $x=0$, given by $h(0,t) = H_{1} \\cos(\\omega t)$. After a sufficient amount of time, the influence of the initial condition $h(x,0)=0$ decays, and the system oscillates with the same frequency $\\omega$ as the forcing. We can therefore seek a steady-periodic solution.\n\nIt is convenient to use complex variables to solve this problem. We represent the boundary condition as the real part of a complex exponential: $h(0,t) = \\text{Re}\\{H_{1} e^{i\\omega t}\\}$. We then seek a solution of the form $h(x,t) = \\text{Re}\\{\\hat{h}(x) e^{i\\omega t}\\}$, where $\\hat{h}(x)$ is a complex-valued function representing the spatial amplitude and phase of the head oscillation.\n\nSubstituting this form into the diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left(\\hat{h}(x) e^{i\\omega t}\\right) = D \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} \\left(\\hat{h}(x) e^{i\\omega t}\\right)\n$$\n$$\ni\\omega \\hat{h}(x) e^{i\\omega t} = D \\frac{d^2\\hat{h}(x)}{dx^2} e^{i\\omega t}\n$$\nThis simplifies to an ordinary differential equation for $\\hat{h}(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\hat{h}}{dx^2} - \\frac{i\\omega}{D} \\hat{h} = 0\n$$\nLet's define a complex wave number $k^2 = i\\omega/D$.

Thus:\n$$\nk = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{D}} \\sqrt{i} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{D}} \\frac{1+i}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2D}}(1+i)\n$$\nLet $\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2D}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega S}{2T}}$. Then $k = \\alpha(1+i)$. The real part of $k$ is positive.\n\nNow we apply the boundary conditions to find the coefficients $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n1.  The far-field condition states that the head disturbance remains bounded as $x \\to \\infty$. The term $e^{kx} = e^{\\alpha(1+i)x} = e^{\\alpha x}e^{i\\alpha x}$ has a magnitude $|e^{\\alpha x}| = e^{\\alpha x}$ which grows exponentially as $x \\to \\infty$ since $\\alpha0$. To keep the solution bounded, we must set its coefficient $C_1 = 0$.\n2.  The solution is now $\\hat{h}(x) = C_2 e^{-kx}$. At the seaward boundary $x=0$, we have $h(0,t) = \\text{Re}\\{\\hat{h}(0)e^{i\\omega t}\\} = \\text{Re}\\{C_2 e^{i\\omega t}\\}$. This must match the given condition $h(0,t) = H_1 \\cos(\\omega t) = \\text{Re}\\{H_1 e^{i\\omega t}\\}$. Comparing these, we find $C_2 = H_1$.\n\nThe complex amplitude for the head is therefore:\n$$\n\\hat{h}(x) = H_1 e^{-kx} = H_1 e^{-\\alpha(1+i)x}\n$$\nThe corresponding long-time solution for the head is $h(x,t) = \\text{Re}\\{H_1 e^{-\\alpha x} e^{-i\\alpha x} e^{i\\omega t}\\} = H_1 e^{-\\alpha x} \\cos(\\omega t - \\alpha x)$.\n\nNext, we derive the volumetric Darcy flux per unit width, $q(x,t) = -T \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x}$. We can work with the complex representations. The complex amplitude for the flux, $\\hat{q}(x)$, is given by:\n$$\n\\hat{q}(x) = -T \\frac{d\\hat{h}(x)}{dx}\n$$\nDifferentiating $\\hat{h}(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\hat{h}}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} (H_1 e^{-kx}) = -k H_1 e^{-kx}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\hat{q}(x)$:\n$$\n\\hat{q}(x) = -T(-k H_1 e^{-kx}) = T k H_1 e^{-kx}\n$$\nThe real-valued, time-dependent flux is $q(x,t) = \\text{Re}\\{\\hat{q}(x)e^{i\\omega t}\\}$. The amplitude of this function, which we denote $A_q(x)$, is the magnitude of the complex amplitude $\\hat{q}(x)$:\n$$\nA_q(x) = |\\hat{q}(x)| = |T k H_1 e^{-kx}| = T H_1 |k| |e^{-kx}|\n$$\nWe evaluate the magnitudes of the complex terms:\n- $|k| = |\\sqrt{i\\omega/D}| = \\sqrt{|i\\omega/D|} = \\sqrt{\\omega/D} = \\sqrt{\\omega S/T}$.\n- $|e^{-kx}| = |e^{-\\alpha(1+i)x}| = |e^{-\\alpha x} e^{-i\\alpha x}| = |e^{-\\alpha x}| |e^{-i\\alpha x}| = e^{-\\alpha x} \\cdot 1 = e^{-\\alpha x}$, since $\\alpha > 0$ and $x \\ge 0$.\n\nSubstituting these back into the amplitude expression:\n$$\nA_q(x) = T H_1 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega S}{T}} e^{-\\alpha x} = H_1 \\sqrt{T^2 \\frac{\\omega S}{T}} e^{-\\alpha x} = H_1 \\sqrt{T \\omega S} e^{-\\alpha x}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the amplitude at a fixed interior location $x = L$. We substitute $x = L$ and the expression for $\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega S}{2T}}$:\n$$\nA_q(L) = H_1 \\sqrt{T \\omega S} \\exp\\left(-L\\alpha\\right) = H_1 \\sqrt{T \\omega S} \\exp\\left(-L\\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega S}{2T}}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the amplitude of the volumetric Darcy flux per unit width at $x=L$. The units are $[L][(L^2 T^{-1})(T^{-1})]^{1/2} = [L][L^2 T^{-2}]^{1/2} = [L][L T^{-1}] = [L^2 T^{-1}]$, which corresponds to $\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}$ as required.",

            "introduction": "In many real-world modeling scenarios, boundary conditions are not perfectly known and must be inferred from observational data. This practice bridges the gap between theoretical models and practical applications by introducing the concept of parameter calibration, a cornerstone of environmental system modeling. You will work with a steady-state transport model featuring a versatile Robin boundary condition and use interior concentration measurements to determine the unknown upstream concentration $C_0$ and a boundary exchange coefficient $k$, thereby learning a powerful technique for constraining models with data .",

            "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional, steady-state, conservative-reactive tracer in a uniform open-channel flow segment modeled on the interval $x \\in [0,L]$. The governing equation is derived from conservation of mass and Fickian dispersion with a first-order decay. Under the assumptions of constant advective velocity $u$, constant dispersion coefficient $D$, and constant first-order decay rate $\\lambda$, the steady-state concentration $C(x)$ satisfies\n$$\nD \\frac{d^2 C}{dx^2} - u \\frac{d C}{dx} - \\lambda C = 0.\n$$\nAt the upstream boundary $x=0$, the concentration is prescribed by a Dirichlet boundary condition $C(0)=C_0$, where $C_0$ is unknown and must be calibrated. At the downstream boundary $x=L$, exchange with an external reservoir of concentration $C_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ imposes a Robin boundary condition\n$$\n- D \\frac{dC}{dx}(L) = k \\left( C(L) - C_{\\mathrm{ext}} \\right),\n$$\nwhere $k$ is a nonnegative boundary exchange coefficient (with units of meters per second) that is unknown and must be calibrated.\n\nFundamental base: Starting with the conservation of mass for a scalar tracer in one-dimensional open-channel flow subject to advection, diffusion, and first-order decay, along with standard Dirichlet and Robin boundary conditions, the solution $C(x)$ is of exponential form for constant coefficients. The characteristic equation associated with the linear ordinary differential equation yields two real characteristic rates $r_1$ and $r_2$ (or a repeated rate $r$ in the degenerate case), from which the general solution can be constructed. The boundary conditions determine the integration constants. Calibration is posed as a least-squares minimization problem that tunes the unknown boundary parameters to best reproduce interior concentration observations.\n\nTask: Derive the analytical solution structure, show how boundary conditions determine the integration constants, and implement a computational procedure to calibrate the pair $(C_0, k)$ by minimizing the sum of squared misfits between model predictions and provided interior observations. The calibration must respect physically meaningful bounds: $C_0 \\ge 0$ and $k \\ge 0$.\n\nAnalytical structure (do not use this as a shortcut; you must derive it from the governing equation and boundary conditions): For distinct characteristic rates $r_1$ and $r_2$, the solution takes the form $C(x) = A e^{r_1 x} + B e^{r_2 x}$ for constants $A$ and $B$ determined by the boundary conditions. For a repeated characteristic rate $r$, the solution takes the form $C(x) = (A + B x) e^{r x}$.\n\nCalibration objective: Given location-specific observations $\\{ (x_i, y_i ) \\}$, define the least-squares objective\n$$\nJ(C_0, k) = \\sum_{i} \\left[ C_{\\text{model}}(x_i; C_0, k) - y_i \\right]^2,\n$$\nand compute the minimizing $(C_0, k)$ subject to $C_0 \\ge 0$ and $k \\ge 0$.\n\nUnits: All distances must be in meters, time in seconds, velocity in meters per second, dispersion in square meters per second, decay rate in inverse seconds, exchange coefficient in meters per second, and concentration in milligrams per liter. Your program must return $C_0$ in milligrams per liter and $k$ in meters per second. No angles are involved. No percentages are involved.\n\nTest suite: Use the following three scientifically plausible cases with different regimes to test distinct aspects (happy path, weak-exchange boundary case, strong-exchange boundary case). For each case, the observations are synthetic and consistent with the forward model.\n\n- Case A (happy path, moderate advection and dispersion, nonzero downstream exchange):\n  - $u = 0.1$ $\\mathrm{m/s}$, $D = 10$ $\\mathrm{m^2/s}$, $\\lambda = 1\\times 10^{-4}$ $\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, $L = 1000$ $\\mathrm{m}$, $C_{\\mathrm{ext}} = 0$ $\\mathrm{mg/L}$.\n  - Observation locations $x$ are $[200, 500, 800]$ $\\mathrm{m}$.\n  - Observed concentrations $y$ are $[4.1630, 3.1630, 2.4171]$ $\\mathrm{mg/L}$.\n  - The physically reasonable bounds for calibration are $0 \\le C_0 \\le 10$ and $0 \\le k \\le 0.01$.\n\n- Case B (edge case with zero downstream exchange, i.e., pure zero-flux Neumann boundary at the downstream end due to $k=0$):\n  - $u = 0.05$ $\\mathrm{m/s}$, $D = 5$ $\\mathrm{m^2/s}$, $\\lambda = 2\\times 10^{-4}$ $\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, $L = 200$ $\\mathrm{m}$, $C_{\\mathrm{ext}} = 0$ $\\mathrm{mg/L}$.\n  - Observation locations $x$ are $[50, 120, 180]$ $\\mathrm{m}$.\n  - Observed concentrations $y$ are $[2.6045, 2.1921, 2.0047]$ $\\mathrm{mg/L}$.\n  - The physically reasonable bounds for calibration are $0 \\le C_0 \\le 5$ and $0 \\le k \\le 0.01$.\n\n- Case C (strong downstream exchange, Robin boundary closely approximates a Dirichlet condition toward the external reservoir):\n  - $u = 0.05$ $\\mathrm{m/s}$, $D = 1$ $\\mathrm{m^2/s}$, $\\lambda = 1\\times 10^{-3}$ $\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, $L = 80$ $\\mathrm{m}$, $C_{\\mathrm{ext}} = 1$ $\\mathrm{mg/L}$.\n  - Observation locations $x$ are $[10, 40, 80]$ $\\mathrm{m}$.\n  - Observed concentrations $y$ are $[0.4291, 0.2788, 0.2550]$ $\\mathrm{mg/L}$.\n  - The physically reasonable bounds for calibration are $0 \\le C_0 \\le 2$ and $0 \\le k \\le 0.1$.\n\nYour program should calibrate $(C_0, k)$ for each case by minimizing $J(C_0, k)$ using the forward model derived from the governing equation and boundary conditions above. Use only the provided observations and the stated parameter bounds. Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each element is the calibrated parameter pair for a case represented as a two-element list $[C_0, k]$. For example, the output format must be of the form $[[C_{0,A},k_A],[C_{0,B},k_B],[C_{0,C},k_C]]$. All returned $C_0$ values must be in $\\mathrm{mg/L}$ and all returned $k$ values must be in $\\mathrm{m/s}$.",
