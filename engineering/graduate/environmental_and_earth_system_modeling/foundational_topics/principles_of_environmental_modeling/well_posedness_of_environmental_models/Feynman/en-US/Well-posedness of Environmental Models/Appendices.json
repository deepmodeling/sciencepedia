            "problem": "Consider one-dimensional river routing in a long, prismatic, nearly uniform channel under the kinematic-wave approximation, where small acceleration and pressure-gradient terms are neglected relative to advection. Let the dimensionless discharge be denoted by $u(x,t)$, where $x$ is the along-channel coordinate and $t$ is time, and assume a strictly convex, increasing flux function $f(u)$ encoding the discharge–wave speed relation. Starting from conservation of mass in a one-dimensional control volume, derive the scalar conservation law $u_t + f(u)_x = 0$ as a weak form of mass conservation. Define the notion of a weak solution for this partial differential equation (PDE). Then, formulate the Riemann problem with piecewise constant initial data $u(x,0) = u_L$ for $x < 0$ and $u(x,0) = u_R$ for $x > 0$, and state an entropy condition that guarantees uniqueness of the weak solution for strictly convex $f$.\n\nSpecialize to the convex flux $f(u) = \\tfrac{1}{2} u^2$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for a multi-step analysis of a scalar conservation law describing one-dimensional river routing, culminating in the evaluation of a specific Riemann problem solution.\n\nFirst, we derive the conservation law. Consider the mass of a conserved quantity, represented by its dimensionless density $u(x,t)$, within a spatial control volume $[x_1, x_2]$. The total mass is $M(t) = \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} u(x,t) \\, dx$. The principle of conservation of mass states that the rate of change of mass in this volume is equal to the flux into the volume at $x_1$ minus the flux out of the volume at $x_2$. Let the flux be given by a function $f(u)$. Then,\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} u(x,t) \\, dx = f(u(x_1, t)) - f(u(x_2, t))\n$$\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the right-hand side can be written as an integral:\n$$\nf(u(x_1, t)) - f(u(x_2, t)) = - \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} f(u(x,t)) \\, dx\n$$\nAssuming $u$ is sufficiently smooth to allow interchanging differentiation and integration, we have:\n$$\n\\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} \\, dx = - \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \\frac{\\partial f(u)}{\\partial x} \\, dx\n$$\nThis can be combined into a single integral:\n$$\n\\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial f(u)}{\\partial x} \\right) \\, dx = 0\n$$\nSince this integral must be zero for any arbitrary interval $[x_1, x_2]$, the integrand must be zero if it is continuous. This yields the differential form of the scalar conservation law, $u_t + f(u)_x = 0$, where subscripts denote partial differentiation.\n\nThis strong form requires solutions to be differentiable. To allow for discontinuous solutions like shock waves, we define a weak solution. A function $u(x,t)$ is a weak solution of the conservation law with initial data $u(x,0) = u_0(x)$ if for all smooth test functions $\\phi(x,t)$ with compact support in the domain $t \\ge 0$, the following integral identity holds:\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\left( u(x,t) \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} + f(u(x,t)) \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} \\right) \\, dx \\, dt + \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty u_0(x) \\phi(x,0) \\, dx = 0\n$$\nThis formulation is derived from the strong form by multiplying by $\\phi$ and integrating by parts, transferring the derivatives from $u$ and $f(u)$ to the test function $\\phi$.\n\nThe Riemann problem for this PDE is an initial value problem with piecewise constant initial data:\n$$\nu(x,0) = \\begin{cases} u_L & \\text{for } x < 0 \\\\ u_R & \\text{for } x > 0 \\end{cases}\n$$\nWeak solutions to the Riemann problem are not necessarily unique. Uniqueness is guaranteed by imposing an entropy condition. For a strictly convex flux function $f(u)$, the Lax entropy condition states that for a discontinuity (shock) propagating with speed $s$ separating a state $u_L$ on the left from $u_R$ on the right, the characteristic speeds $c(u) = f'(u)$ must satisfy:\n$$\nf'(u_L) > s > f'(u_R)\n$$\nThis means that characteristics on both sides of the shock must propagate into the shock front. The shock speed $s$ itself is determined by the Rankine–Hugoniot jump condition, which is derived from the integral form of the conservation law across the discontinuity:\n$$\ns = \\frac{f(u_R) - f(u_L)}{u_R - u_L}\n$$\n\nNow we specialize to the given problem: the flux function is $f(u) = \\frac{1}{2} u^2$, which is strictly convex for $u>0$ since $f''(u) = 1 > 0$. The initial data are $u_L = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $u_R = 2$.\nThe characteristic speed is $c(u) = f'(u) = u$.\nWe evaluate the characteristic speeds at the initial states:\n$c(u_L) = u_L = \\frac{1}{2}$\n$c(u_R) = u_R = 2$\n\nWe must decide if the solution is a shock or a rarefaction wave. A shock wave would form if characteristics collide, which occurs when $c(u_L) > c(u_R)$. Here, we have $c(u_L) = \\frac{1}{2} < c(u_R) = 2$. Since the characteristics are diverging, the solution is not a shock but a rarefaction wave.\nTo confirm, let's test the entropy condition for a hypothetical shock. Its speed would be:\n$$\ns = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}u_R^2 - \\frac{1}{2}u_L^2}{u_R - u_L} = \\frac{1}{2}(u_L + u_R) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + 2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{5}{2} \\right) = \\frac{5}{4}\n$$\nThe Lax entropy condition requires $c(u_L) > s > c(u_R)$. Substituting the values:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} > \\frac{5}{4} > 2\n$$\nThis inequality is false, so a shock solution is not admissible. The solution must be a rarefaction wave.\n\nThe solution to the Riemann problem for a conservation law is self-similar, i.e., it depends only on the variable $\\xi = x/t$. For a rarefaction wave, the solution consists of three parts: the constant state $u_L$ to the left, the constant state $u_R$ to the right, and a continuous transition between them. This transition region, the rarefaction fan, is bounded by the rays $x/t = c(u_L)$ and $x/t = c(u_R)$. Within the fan, the solution is given by the condition that the characteristic speed equals the ray speed:\n$$\nc(u) = \\frac{x}{t} \\implies u = \\frac{x}{t}\n$$\nThus, the complete self-similar solution is:\n$$\nu(x,t) = \\begin{cases}\nu_L = \\frac{1}{2} & \\text{for } \\frac{x}{t} < c(u_L) = \\frac{1}{2} \\\\\n\\frac{x}{t} & \\text{for } c(u_L) \\le \\frac{x}{t} \\le c(u_R), \\text{ i.e., } \\frac{1}{2} \\le \\frac{x}{t} \\le 2 \\\\\nu_R = 2 & \\text{for } \\frac{x}{t} > c(u_R) = 2\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nWe need to evaluate this solution at the spacetime point $(x,t) = \\left(\\frac{3}{2}, 1\\right)$. We compute the self-similar variable $\\xi = x/t$:\n$$\n\\xi = \\frac{x}{t} = \\frac{3/2}{1} = \\frac{3}{2}\n$$\nWe now determine which region this value of $\\xi$ falls into. We check the inequalities:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\le \\frac{3}{2} \\le 2\n$$\nSince $0.5 \\le 1.5 \\le 2$, this is true. The point lies within the rarefaction fan. Therefore, the solution at this point is given by $u(x,t) = x/t$.\n$$\nu\\left(\\frac{3}{2}, 1\\right) = \\frac{3/2}{1} = \\frac{3}{2}\n$$\nThe value of the dimensionless discharge at the specified spacetime point is $\\frac{3}{2}$.",

The system is equivalent to:\n$$\n\\partial_t h + u\\partial_x h + h\\partial_x u = 0 \\\\\n\\partial_t u + u\\partial_x u + g\\partial_x h = 0\n$$\nThis can be written as $\\partial_t \\mathbf{q} + A(\\mathbf{q})\\partial_x \\mathbf{q} = 0$, where the Jacobian matrix $A(\\mathbf{q})$ is:\n$$\nA(\\mathbf{q}) = \\begin{pmatrix} u & h \\\\ g & u \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues of $A(\\mathbf{q})$ give the characteristic speeds of wave propagation.

The corresponding right eigenvectors are found to be $\\mathbf{r}_{\\pm} \\propto (1, \\pm\\sqrt{g/h})^T$.\n\nThe Riemann invariants are quantities that remain constant along characteristic curves. They are functions $R(h,u)$ that satisfy $\\nabla R \\cdot \\mathbf{r} = 0$. This leads to the two families of Riemann invariants:\n$$\nR_+ = u + 2\\sqrt{gh} \\quad (\\text{constant across waves with speed } \\lambda_-) \\\\\nR_- = u - 2\\sqrt{gh} \\quad (\\text{constant across waves with speed } \\lambda_+)\n$$\n\nThe initial condition is a Riemann problem with a left state $\\mathbf{q}_L = (h_L, 0)$ and a right state $\\mathbf{q}_R = (0, 0)$. Since the initial data and the equations are invariant under the scaling $(x, t) \\to (\\alpha x, \\alpha t)$ for any $\\alpha > 0$, the solution must be self-similar. This means the solution depends only on the similarity variable $\\xi = x/t$. Let $h(x,t) = H(\\xi)$ and $u(x,t) = U(\\xi)$.\n\nThe solution connects state $\\mathbf{q}_L$ to $\\mathbf{q}_R$. The characteristic speeds at the left state are $\\lambda_{\\pm}(h_L, 0) = \\pm\\sqrt{gh_L}$. Since the water must flow from the reservoir ($x<0$) into the dry bed ($x>0$), we expect an expansion wave. The wave pattern consists of a rarefaction wave moving to the left, and a front advancing to the right into the dry region. The connection to the $h=0$ state is singular. The physically correct solution consists of a single rarefaction wave that extends from the undisturbed reservoir to the tip of the advancing water.\n\nThe solution structure in the $(x,t)$ plane is as follows:\n1.  **Left State:** For $\\xi < -\\sqrt{gh_L}$, the fluid is undisturbed: $(h,u) = (h_L, 0)$. The line $\\xi = -\\sqrt{gh_L}$ is the tail of the rarefaction wave, corresponding to the characteristic speed $\\lambda_-(h_L, 0) = 0 - \\sqrt{gh_L}$.\n2.  **Rarefaction Wave:** This wave connects the left state to the state at the wetting front. This must be a rarefaction associated with the $\\lambda_-$ family of characteristics (a 2-rarefaction). Across this wave, the Riemann invariant $R_+ = u+2\\sqrt{gh}$ must be constant. We evaluate its value from the left state:\n    $$\n    u + 2\\sqrt{gh} = u_L + 2\\sqrt{gh_L} = 0 + 2\\sqrt{gh_L} = 2\\sqrt{gh_L}\n    $$\n    This relation holds for any point $(h,u)$ within the rarefaction fan. Furthermore, for a point to be part of this self-similar rarefaction, its speed $\\xi$ must equal the characteristic speed at that point:\n    $$\n    \\xi = \\lambda_-(h,u) = u - \\sqrt{gh}\n    $$\n    We have a system of two equations for $h(\\xi)$ and $u(\\xi)$. From the first equation, we express $u$ in terms of $h$: $u = 2\\sqrt{gh_L} - 2\\sqrt{gh}$. Substituting this into the second equation gives $\\xi$ in terms of $h$:\n    $$\n    \\xi = (2\\sqrt{gh_L} - 2\\sqrt{gh}) - \\sqrt{gh} = 2\\sqrt{gh_L} - 3\\sqrt{gh}\n    $$\n    From this, we can express the solution profile within the rarefaction fan $(-\\sqrt{gh_L} \\le \\xi \\le s_f)$:\n    $$\n    H(\\xi) = \\frac{1}{9g}\\left(2\\sqrt{gh_L} - \\xi\\right)^2 \\\\\n    U(\\xi) = \\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\sqrt{gh_L} + \\xi\\right)\n    $$\n3.  **Wetting Front:** The advancing front of the water is a contact discontinuity whose speed, let's call it $s_f$, must be equal to the fluid velocity at the front, $u_f$. The similarity variable at the front is $\\xi_f = s_f$. At this front, the water depth is zero: $h_f=0$.\n\nWe can now determine the state at the front and its speed. The front is the leading edge of the rarefaction wave. The relation $u+2\\sqrt{gh} = 2\\sqrt{gh_L}$ must hold up to the front. At the front, where $h=h_f=0$, we find the fluid velocity:\n$$\nu_f + 2\\sqrt{g \\cdot 0} = 2\\sqrt{gh_L} \\implies u_f = 2\\sqrt{gh_L}\n$$\nThe speed of the wetting front is equal to this fluid velocity:\n$$\ns_f = u_f = 2\\sqrt{gh_L}\n$$\nThis rarefaction fan extends from $\\xi = -\\sqrt{gh_L}$ to $\\xi = s_f = 2\\sqrt{gh_L}$. The solution is consistent, as the water depth $H(\\xi)$ continuously decreases to $0$ at $\\xi = 2\\sqrt{gh_L}$.\n\nThe problem requires the nondimensional wetting-front speed, $\\hat{s}_f$. The provided scaling relations are:\n$$\n\\hat{t}=\\frac{t}{\\sqrt{h_L/g}},\\quad \\hat{u}=\\frac{u}{\\sqrt{g h_L}}\n$$\nA speed has dimensions of length/time. The characteristic speed used for nondimensionalization is $\\sqrt{gh_L}$. The nondimensional speed is defined as $\\hat{s}_f = s_f / \\sqrt{g h_L}$.\nSubstituting our result for $s_f$:\n$$\n\\hat{s}_f = \\frac{2\\sqrt{gh_L}}{\\sqrt{gh_L}} = 2\n$$\n\nFinally, we address the role of the entropy condition. The theory of hyperbolic conservation laws shows that weak solutions, which satisfy the integral form of the equations and allow for discontinuities, are not unique. For the dam-break problem, one could mathematically construct an alternative solution involving a shock wave (specifically, a \"rarefaction shock\") that also satisfies the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions. Such a solution would represent a discontinuous drop in water level, which is physically unrealistic as it violates the second law of thermodynamics (in its fluid mechanical guise, it would correspond to a spontaneous un-dissipation of energy).\n\nThe entropy admissibility criterion is an additional mathematical constraint, motivated by physical principles, that is imposed to select the unique, physically relevant weak solution. For systems like the SWE, this condition requires that mechanical energy must be dissipated (or conserved in the limit of a rarefaction) across any discontinuity. This rules out unphysical solutions like rarefaction shocks and selects the continuous rarefaction wave as the correct solution for an expansion problem.\n\nA convex entropy function for the SWE is the total mechanical energy density (per unit area of the bed):\n$$\n\\eta(h,u) = \\frac{1}{2}hu^2 + \\frac{1}{2}gh^2\n$$\nThis function can be shown to be a strictly convex function of the conserved variables $(h, hu)$ for $h>0$. The corresponding entropy flux, which makes $(\\eta, q)$ an entropy-entropy flux pair satisfying $\\partial_t \\eta + \\partial_x q = 0$ for smooth solutions, is:\n$$\nq(h,u) = u\\left(\\frac{1}{2}hu^2 + gh^2\\right) = u(\\eta + \\frac{1}{2}gh^2)\n$$\nThis pair is used to formulate the entropy condition, which for a shock discontinuity moving at speed $s$ is given by the inequality $s[\\eta] - [q] \\le 0$, ensuring that physical shocks are compressive and dissipate energy.",

The reaction function $R(c)$ is Lipschitz continuous with constant $L_{R}$ and satisfies $R(0)=0$, which implies $|R(c)| \\leq L_{R}|c|$. Therefore, $c R(c) \\leq |c| |R(c)| \\leq L_{R} c^{2}$. Integrating over $\\Omega$:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} c R(c) \\, dx \\leq \\int_{\\Omega} L_{R} c^{2} \\, dx = L_{R} \\|c\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}^{2}\n$$\n\nThe fifth term is the source term. Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} c f \\, dx \\leq \\|c\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)} \\|f\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}\n$$\nWe are given that $\\| f(t,\\cdot) \\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)} \\leq F$ for a constant $F \\geq 0$. Thus:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} c f \\, dx \\leq F \\|c\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}\n$$\n\nCombining these results, the integrated equation becomes the following differential inequality:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{d}{dt} \\|c\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}^{2} + k_{\\min} \\|\\nabla c\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}^{2} \\leq L_{R} \\|c\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}^{2} + F \\|c\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}\n$$\nSince the diffusion term $k_{\\min} \\|\\nabla c\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}^{2}$ is non-negative, we can drop it to obtain a weaker inequality that provides an upper bound on the growth of the $L^2$-norm:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{d}{dt} \\|c\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}^{2} \\leq L_{R} \\|c\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}^{2} + F \\|c\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}\n$$\nLet $y(t) = \\|c(t, \\cdot)\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}$. The inequality is $\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{d}{dt} (y(t)^2) \\leq L_{R} y(t)^2 + F y(t)$. Since $\\frac{d}{dt}(y^2) = 2y \\frac{dy}{dt}$, we have $y(t) \\frac{dy}{dt} \\leq L_{R} y(t)^2 + F y(t)$. For regions where $y(t) > 0$, we can divide by $y(t)$ to get:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} \\leq L_{R} y(t) + F\n$$\nThis is a standard linear first-order differential inequality. By Grönwall's comparison principle, $y(t)$ is bounded by the solution of the corresponding ordinary differential equation $\\frac{dz}{dt} = L_{R} z(t) + F$ with initial condition $z(0) = y(0) = \\|c_0\\|_{L^2(\\Omega)}$.\nIf $L_{R} > 0$, the solution is:\n$$\nz(t) = \\left(z(0) + \\frac{F}{L_{R}}\\right) \\exp(L_{R} t) - \\frac{F}{L_{R}} = z(0) \\exp(L_{R} t) + \\frac{F}{L_{R}} (\\exp(L_{R} t) - 1)\n$$\nTherefore, for any $t \\in [0,T]$:\n$$\n\\|c(t, \\cdot)\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)} \\leq \\|c_{0}\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)} \\exp(L_{R} t) + \\frac{F}{L_{R}} (\\exp(L_{R} t) - 1)\n$$\nIf $L_{R} = 0$, the inequality is $\\frac{dy}{dt} \\leq F$, which integrates to $y(t) \\leq y(0) + Ft$. This result is recovered by taking the limit $L_R \\to 0$ in the expression above, since $\\lim_{L_R \\to 0} (\\exp(L_R t) - 1)/L_R = t$.\nThe right-hand side of the inequality is a monotonically increasing function of $t$ for $t \\ge 0$, since $L_R, F, \\|c_0\\|_{L^2(\\Omega)}$ are all non-negative. The maximum value over the interval $[0,T]$ is thus achieved at $t=T$.\nThis gives us the a priori bound for the $L^{\\infty}(0,T; L^{2}(\\Omega))$ norm:\n$$\n\\|c\\|_{L^{\\infty}(0,T; L^{2}(\\Omega))} = \\sup_{t \\in [0,T]} \\|c(t, \\cdot)\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)} \\leq \\|c_{0}\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)} \\exp(L_{R} T) + \\frac{F}{L_{R}} (\\exp(L_{R} T) - 1)\n$$\n\nThis a priori bound is fundamental to establishing the well-posedness (existence, uniqueness, and continuous dependence on data) of the coupled problem where $\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{U}(c)$. The derivation of the bound is independent of the specific velocity field $\\mathbf{u}$, provided it satisfies the incompressibility and boundary conditions. This uniformity is key.\n1.  **Existence**: Well-posedness for such a nonlinear PDE is often proven using fixed-point theorems (e.g., Schauder's theorem) or the Galerkin method. Both approaches require identifying a bounded, closed, convex set in a suitable function space that is mapped into itself by the solution operator. The a priori bound establishes exactly this property. It guarantees that any potential solution remains within a bounded ball in $L^{\\infty}(0,T; L^2(\\Omega))$. This allows one to define a solution operator $\\mathcal{T}: c \\mapsto c_{\\text{new}}$ that maps a known state $c$ to the solution $c_{\\text{new}}$ of the problem with velocity $\\mathbf{U}(c)$, and the bound ensures that $\\mathcal{T}$ maps a sufficiently large ball back into itself, fulfilling a crucial requirement of fixed-point theorems.\n2.  **Uniqueness and Continuous Dependence**: To prove uniqueness, one considers two solutions $c_1$ and $c_2$ and derives an energy estimate for their difference $w = c_1 - c_2$. This leads to a Grönwall-type inequality for $\\|w(t)\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}^2$. The resulting inequality involves terms that depend on the solutions $c_1$ and $c_2$ themselves (e.g., $\\|\\nabla c_2\\|$). The a priori bound on the solutions, and related bounds on their gradients that can also be derived from the energy identity (by integrating in time), are critical to control these coefficients and close the argument. This shows that $\\|w(t)\\|$ is controlled by $\\|w(0)\\|$, which implies that identical initial data leads to identical solutions (uniqueness) and that small perturbations in the initial data lead to small perturbations in the solution (continuous dependence).\n\nIn summary, the a priori bound confines the solution to a known, bounded region of the function space, which is the essential prerequisite for applying the powerful machinery of functional analysis to prove existence and uniqueness for the nonlinear coupled system.",
