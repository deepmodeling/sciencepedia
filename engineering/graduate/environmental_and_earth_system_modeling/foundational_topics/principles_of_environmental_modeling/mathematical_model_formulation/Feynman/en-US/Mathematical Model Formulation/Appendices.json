            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a dimensionless group that compares the rates of advection and diffusion for a passive scalar, based on the governing partial differential equation (PDE) for scalar transport. The derivation will proceed by formulating the PDE from first principles and then rendering it dimensionless through the introduction of characteristic scales.\n\nFirst, we establish the governing PDE. The conservation of a scalar quantity with concentration $c(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ in a domain without sources or sinks is described by the continuity equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{J}$ is the total flux of the scalar. The total flux is the sum of the advective flux, $\\mathbf{J}_{\\text{adv}}$, due to transport by the bulk flow, and the diffusive flux, $\\mathbf{J}_{\\text{diff}}$, due to molecular diffusion.\n\nThe advective flux is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J}_{\\text{adv}} = c\\mathbf{u}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity field of the fluid.\n\nThe diffusive flux is described by Fick's first law. Given that the diffusion coefficient $D$ is constant and isotropic, the flux is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J}_{\\text{diff}} = -D \\nabla c\n$$\nThe total flux is therefore $\\mathbf{J} = c\\mathbf{u} - D\\nabla c$. Substituting this into the continuity equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (c\\mathbf{u} - D\\nabla c) = 0\n$$\nUsing the product rule for divergence, $\\nabla \\cdot (c\\mathbf{u}) = (\\nabla c) \\cdot \\mathbf{u} + c(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u})$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + (\\nabla c) \\cdot \\mathbf{u} + c(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) - \\nabla \\cdot(D\\nabla c) = 0\n$$\nThe problem states that the flow is incompressible, which implies $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$. It also states that $D$ is a constant, so $\\nabla \\cdot(D\\nabla c) = D \\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla c) = D \\nabla^2 c$. The governing advection-diffusion equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla c = D \\nabla^2 c\n$$\nNext, we nondimensionalize this equation. We introduce dimensionless variables, denoted by a prime ($'$), using the characteristic scales provided:\n-   Characteristic length: $L$\n-   Characteristic speed: $U$\n-   Characteristic concentration: $C_0$\n\nFrom these, we can define a characteristic time scale. A natural choice for transport problems is the advective time scale, $t_{\\text{adv}} = L/U$. The dimensionless variables are thus:\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}' = \\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{L}, \\quad t' = \\frac{t}{L/U} = \\frac{tU}{L}, \\quad \\mathbf{u}' = \\frac{\\mathbf{u}}{U}, \\quad c' = \\frac{c}{C_0}\n$$\nWe transform the derivatives in the PDE using the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial t'}{\\partial t} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t'} = \\frac{U}{L} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t'}\n$$\n$$\n\\nabla = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{x}'}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}'} = \\frac{1}{L} \\nabla'\n$$\n$$\n\\nabla^2 = \\nabla \\cdot \\nabla = \\left(\\frac{1}{L}\\nabla'\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{L}\\nabla'\\right) = \\frac{1}{L^2} \\nabla'^2\n$$\nSubstituting these transformed operators and dimensionless variables into the advection-diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\frac{U}{L}\\frac{\\partial (C_0 c')}{\\partial t'} + (U\\mathbf{u}') \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{L}\\nabla'(C_0 c')\\right) = D \\frac{1}{L^2} \\nabla'^2(C_0 c')\n$$\nSince $C_0$, $U$, and $L$ are constants, we can factor them out:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{U C_0}{L}\\right) \\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial t'} + \\left(\\frac{U C_0}{L}\\right) \\mathbf{u}' \\cdot \\nabla'c' = \\left(\\frac{D C_0}{L^2}\\right) \\nabla'^2 c'\n$$\nTo make the equation dimensionless, we divide all terms by the coefficient of the advection term, $\\frac{U C_0}{L}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial t'} + \\mathbf{u}' \\cdot \\nabla'c' = \\frac{D C_0 / L^2}{U C_0 / L} \\nabla'^2 c'\n$$\nSimplifying the coefficient on the right-hand side yields the single dimensionless group:\n$$\n\\frac{D C_0}{L^2} \\frac{L}{U C_0} = \\frac{D}{UL}\n$$\nThe dimensionless advection-diffusion equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial t'} + \\mathbf{u}' \\cdot \\nabla'c' = \\left(\\frac{D}{UL}\\right) \\nabla'^2 c'\n$$\nThe problem asks for the dimensionless group that compares the *rate of advection to the rate of diffusion*. This is the ratio of the magnitude of the advection term to the magnitude of the diffusion term in the original dimensional equation. Let us estimate the order of magnitude of these terms:\n-   Advection term: $|\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla c| \\sim U \\frac{C_0}{L}$\n-   Diffusion term: $|D \\nabla^2 c| \\sim D \\frac{C_0}{L^2}$\n\nThe ratio of these magnitudes is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{Rate of Advection}}{\\text{Rate of Diffusion}} = \\frac{U C_0 / L}{D C_0 / L^2} = \\frac{UL}{D}\n$$\nThis dimensionless group is known as the Péclet number, denoted $Pe$. It is the inverse of the group that appeared in our nondimensionalized equation. This is expected, as our choice of time scale (advective) made the advection term of order unity. The Péclet number $Pe = \\frac{UL}{D}$ directly represents the ratio of the advective transport rate to the diffusive transport rate.\n\nThe physical interpretation of the limiting regimes is as follows:\n-   When $Pe = \\frac{UL}{D} \\gg 1$: This regime is advection-dominated. The transport of the scalar is primarily governed by the bulk fluid motion. The scalar plume is carried along streamlines with minimal spreading from molecular diffusion. Concentration gradients remain sharp.\n-   When $Pe = \\frac{UL}{D} \\ll 1$: This regime is diffusion-dominated. The transport of the scalar is primarily governed by molecular diffusion. The scalar spreads out from its initial location, and this spreading process is much faster than its transport by the mean flow. Concentration gradients are quickly smoothed out.\n\nThe closed-form expression for the dimensionless group comparing the rate of advection to the rate of diffusion is therefore $\\frac{UL}{D}$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the formulation and nondimensionalization of a one-dimensional advection-reaction model for a dissolved tracer in a river, followed by the identification and interpretation of the governing nondimensional parameter.\n\nFirst, we formulate the governing differential equation for the steady-state, cross-sectionally averaged concentration $C(x)$. We apply the principle of conservation of mass to a differential control volume of length $dx$ and uniform cross-sectional area $A$. The volume of this element is $dV = A dx$.\n\nThe processes affecting the mass of the tracer within this control volume are:\n1.  Advective flux in at position $x$: $F_{in} = U A C(x)$, where $U$ is the mean flow velocity.\n2.  Advective flux out at position $x+dx$: $F_{out} = U A C(x+dx)$.\n3.  Loss due to first-order reaction within the volume: $R = k C(x) dV = k C(x) A dx$, where $k$ is the first-order reaction rate constant.\n\nFor a steady-state system, the rate of change of mass within the control volume is zero. Therefore, the mass balance equation is:\n$$F_{in} - F_{out} - R = 0$$\n$$U A C(x) - U A C(x+dx) - k A C(x) dx = 0$$\nDividing by the area $A$ and rearranging gives:\n$$-U [C(x+dx) - C(x)] - k C(x) dx = 0$$\nDividing by $dx$ yields:\n$$-U \\frac{C(x+dx) - C(x)}{dx} - k C(x) = 0$$\nTaking the limit as $dx \\to 0$, the difference quotient becomes the derivative $\\frac{dC}{dx}$:\n$$-U \\frac{dC}{dx} - kC = 0$$\nThe governing equation for the steady-state concentration $C(x)$ is therefore:\n$$U \\frac{dC}{dx} + kC = 0$$\n\nNext, we nondimensionalize this equation using the given scaling variables: $x = L \\hat{x}$ and $C = C_0 \\hat{C}$, where $L$ is a characteristic length and $C_0$ is a characteristic concentration (e.g., the concentration at the source, $x=0$). The hat symbol $(\\hat{\\cdot})$ denotes a dimensionless variable.\n\nFrom the definitions, we have $d\\hat{x} = \\frac{dx}{L}$ (so $dx = L d\\hat{x}$) and $d\\hat{C} = \\frac{dC}{C_0}$ (so $dC = C_0 d\\hat{C}$).

In this regime, **reaction controls** the concentration profile.\n- If $Da \\approx 1$, the time scales are comparable, and both processes are equally important.\n\nFinally, we compute the value of the Damköhler number using the provided data:\n$U = 0.27\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$\n$L = 12{,}000\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$k = 6.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n\nThe value of the nondimensional parameter is:\n$$Da = \\frac{kL}{U} = \\frac{(6.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}) \\times (12{,}000\\,\\mathrm{m})}{0.27\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}}$$\n$$Da = \\frac{0.072}{0.27} = \\frac{72}{270} = \\frac{8}{30} = \\frac{4}{15} \\approx 0.266666...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$Da = 0.2667$$\nSince $Da = 0.2667 < 1$, we have $T_{adv} < T_{reac}$. This indicates that the advective transport time scale is shorter than the reaction time scale. Specifically, the travel time is about $27\\%$ of the characteristic reaction time. Therefore, for this system, advective **transport controls** the tracer concentration over the length $L$, although the reaction is not entirely negligible and will cause a measurable decrease in concentration along the reach.",
