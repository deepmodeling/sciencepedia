            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of mass conservation and first-order kinetics, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and stated using objective, formal language. It presents a standard exercise in the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which is central to environmental and earth system modeling. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe task is partitioned into three parts: first, to derive a discrete-time representation of the continuous model; second, to solve this discrete model for a specific case; and third, to analyze its long-term behavior in relation to the continuous model's equilibrium.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Discrete-Time Model**\n\nWe begin with the provided continuous-time ODE describing the carbon stock $C(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = I(t) - k\\,C(t)\n$$\nTo discretize this equation, we integrate it over a single time interval from $t_{n} = n\\,\\Delta t$ to $t_{n+1} = (n+1)\\,\\Delta t$.\n$$\n\\int_{t_{n}}^{t_{n+1}} \\frac{dC}{dt} dt = \\int_{t_{n}}^{t_{n+1}} \\left( I(t) - k\\,C(t) \\right) dt\n$$\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the left-hand side evaluates to:\n$$\n\\int_{t_{n}}^{t_{n+1}} \\frac{dC}{dt} dt = C(t_{n+1}) - C(t_{n}) = C_{n+1} - C_{n}\n$$\nThe right-hand side can be split into two integrals:\n$$\nC_{n+1} - C_{n} = \\int_{t_{n}}^{t_{n+1}} I(t) dt - k \\int_{t_{n}}^{t_{n+1}} C(t) dt\n$$\nWe now apply the modeling assumptions and numerical approximations. The input flux $I(t)$ is assumed to be piecewise constant over the interval, i.e., $I(t) \\approx I_{n}$ for $t \\in [t_{n}, t_{n+1})$. Thus, the first integral on the right-hand side becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{t_{n}}^{t_{n+1}} I(t) dt \\approx \\int_{t_{n}}^{t_{n+1}} I_{n} dt = I_{n} (t_{n+1} - t_{n}) = I_{n} \\Delta t\n$$\nFor the second integral, we use the explicit Euler method (or forward rectangle rule for integration), which approximates the integrand $C(t)$ over the interval $[t_{n}, t_{n+1})$ by its value at the start of the interval, $C(t) \\approx C(t_{n}) = C_{n}$.\n$$\n\\int_{t_{n}}^{t_{n+1}} C(t) dt \\approx \\int_{t_{n}}^{t_{n+1}} C_{n} dt = C_{n} (t_{n+1} - t_{n}) = C_{n} \\Delta t\n$$\nSubstituting these approximations back into the integrated equation gives:\n$$\nC_{n+1} - C_{n} \\approx I_{n} \\Delta t - k (C_{n} \\Delta t)\n$$\nThis equation can be interpreted as: change in stock ($C_{n+1} - C_{n}$) equals total input ($I_{n} \\Delta t$) minus total loss ($k C_{n} \\Delta t$) over the time step $\\Delta t$. Rearranging the terms to solve for $C_{n+1}$, we obtain the explicit Euler finite-difference scheme:\n$$\nC_{n+1} = C_{n} + (I_{n} - k C_{n})\\Delta t\n$$\n$$\nC_{n+1} = (1 - k \\Delta t)C_{n} + I_{n} \\Delta t\n$$\nThis is the required discrete-time update relation.\n\n**Part 2: Closed-Form Solution of the Recurrence Relation**\n\nNext, we solve this relation for the special case where the input is constant, $I(t) \\equiv I$ (so $I_{n} = I$ for all $n$), and the initial condition is $C(0) = C_{0}$. The recurrence relation becomes:\n$$\nC_{n+1} = (1 - k \\Delta t)C_{n} + I \\Delta t\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation of the form $x_{n+1} = a x_{n} + b$, with $a = 1 - k \\Delta t$ and $b = I \\Delta t$.\n\nWe can solve this by iteration.\nFor $n=0$: $C_{1} = a C_{0} + b$\nFor $n=1$: $C_{2} = a C_{1} + b = a(a C_{0} + b) + b = a^{2} C_{0} + a b + b$\nFor $n=2$: $C_{3} = a C_{2} + b = a(a^{2} C_{0} + a b + b) + b = a^{3} C_{0} + a^{2} b + a b + b$\n\nBy induction, the general form for $C_{n}$ is:\n$$\nC_{n} = a^{n} C_{0} + b \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} a^{j}\n$$\nThe summation is a finite geometric series. Assuming $a \\neq 1$ (which is true if $k \\Delta t \\neq 0$), the sum is $\\frac{a^{n}-1}{a-1}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $C_{n}$:\n$$\nC_{n} = a^{n} C_{0} + b \\left( \\frac{a^{n}-1}{a-1} \\right)\n$$\nNow, we substitute back the expressions for $a$ and $b$:\n$a = 1 - k \\Delta t$\n$b = I \\Delta t$\n$a - 1 = (1 - k \\Delta t) - 1 = -k \\Delta t$\n\nThus,\n$$\nC_{n} = (1 - k \\Delta t)^{n} C_{0} + (I \\Delta t) \\left( \\frac{(1 - k \\Delta t)^{n}-1}{-k \\Delta t} \\right)\n$$\nSimplifying the second term by canceling $\\Delta t$ (assuming $\\Delta t \\neq 0$):\n$$\nC_{n} = (1 - k \\Delta t)^{n} C_{0} - \\frac{I}{k} \\left( (1 - k \\Delta t)^{n}-1 \\right)\n$$\n$$\nC_{n} = (1 - k \\Delta t)^{n} C_{0} + \\frac{I}{k} \\left( 1 - (1 - k \\Delta t)^{n} \\right)\n$$\nRearranging by factoring out the term $(1 - k \\Delta t)^{n}$:\n$$\nC_{n} = C_{0}(1 - k \\Delta t)^{n} - \\frac{I}{k}(1 - k \\Delta t)^{n} + \\frac{I}{k}\n$$\n$$\nC_{n} = \\left(C_{0} - \\frac{I}{k}\\right)(1 - k \\Delta t)^{n} + \\frac{I}{k}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for $C_{n}$.\n\n**Part 3: Relation to the Static (Steady-State) Model**\n\nThe static or steady-state model is found by setting the rate of change in the continuous model to zero: $\\frac{dC}{dt} = 0$.\n$$\n0 = I - k C_{eq}\n$$\nwhere $C_{eq}$ is the equilibrium carbon stock. Solving for $C_{eq}$ gives:\n$$\nC_{eq} = \\frac{I}{k}\n$$\nNow we examine the long-term behavior of the discrete solution $C_{n}$ as $n \\to \\infty$. The behavior is determined by the term $(1 - k \\Delta t)^{n}$. For the discrete solution to be stable and converge, the magnitude of this term's base must be less than $1$:\n$$\n|1 - k \\Delta t| < 1\n$$\nThis implies $-1 < 1 - k \\Delta t < 1$.\nThe right-hand inequality, $1 - k \\Delta t < 1$, gives $-k \\Delta t < 0$, which is true since both $k > 0$ and $\\Delta t > 0$.\nThe left-hand inequality, $-1 < 1 - k \\Delta t$, gives $k \\Delta t < 2$.\nSo, the stability condition for the explicit Euler method for this problem is $0 < k \\Delta t < 2$.\n\nUnder this stability condition, as $n \\to \\infty$, the term $(1 - k \\Delta t)^{n} \\to 0$. Taking the limit of our solution for $C_{n}$:\n$$\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} C_{n} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left[ \\left(C_{0} - \\frac{I}{k}\\right)(1 - k \\Delta t)^{n} + \\frac{I}{k} \\right] = \\left(C_{0} - \\frac{I}{k}\\right)(0) + \\frac{I}{k} = \\frac{I}{k}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the discrete-time solution converges to the correct steady-state value $C_{eq} = \\frac{I}{k}$ derived from the continuous model, provided the time step $\\Delta t$ is chosen appropriately to ensure numerical stability. The final expression represents the stock of carbon, which, as per the problem instructions, is measured in units of kilograms of carbon (kg C).",

The conservation of mass dictates that the temporal rate of change of the stock equals inputs minus outputs. Empirical evidence supports the assumption that outputs are proportional to the stock with proportionality constant $k$. Prior to $t=0$, the system is at a steady state under a constant input $I(t)=I_0$; at $t=0$ the input undergoes an instantaneous step increase to a new constant input $I(t)=I_1$ for all $t \\geq 0$.

It represents a standard initial value problem in environmental system modeling.\n\nThe evolution of the soil carbon stock $C(t)$ is governed by the principle of mass conservation, which states that the rate of change of the stock is equal to the rate of inputs minus the rate of outputs.\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = I(t) - \\text{Outputs}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the output is due to first-order turnover, meaning the output rate is directly proportional to the current stock size, with a proportionality constant $k$.\n$$\n\\text{Outputs} = kC(t)\n$$\nCombining these two statements yields the governing first-order linear ordinary differential equation for the system:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = I(t) - kC(t) \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\frac{dC}{dt} + kC(t) = I(t)\n$$\n\nFirst, we must determine the initial condition at $t=0$. The problem states that for $t < 0$, the system is at a steady state with a constant input $I(t) = I_0$. At steady state, the stock does not change, so $\\frac{dC}{dt} = 0$. The governing equation becomes:\n$$\n0 = I_0 - kC_{ss,0}\n$$\nwhere $C_{ss,0}$ is the steady-state carbon stock. Solving for $C_{ss,0}$ gives:\n$$\nC_{ss,0} = \\frac{I_0}{k}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the stock $C(t)$ is continuous at $t=0$. Therefore, the initial condition for the subsequent evolution of the system is the stock value at the end of the pre-step period. We denote $C(0) = C(0^+)$ due to continuity.\n$$\nC(0) = C_{ss,0} = \\frac{I_0}{k}\n$$\n\nNext, we solve for the transient response for $t \\geq 0$. During this period, the input is a new constant value, $I(t) = I_1$. The differential equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} + kC = I_1\n$$\nThis is a non-homogeneous first-order linear ODE.

In this context, a static model would predict that the carbon stock is $C_{static}(t) = I(t)/k$. Therefore, at $t=0$, the stock would discontinuously jump from its old steady-state value $C_0 = I_0/k$ to the new steady-state value $C_{\\infty} = I_1/k$.\nThe **dynamic model**, as derived, shows a fundamentally different behavior. The stock $C(t)$ is continuous at $t=0$ and only approaches the new steady state $C_{\\infty}$ asymptotically. The transition is not instantaneous but occurs over a characteristic time scale determined by $1/k$. The dynamic model captures the system's transient response, reflecting its inertia or \"memory\" of its past state, which a static model completely ignores.\n\nFinally, we compute the time $t_{0.99}$ required for the stock to be within $1\\%$ of its new steady state, relative to the initial deviation. The condition is:\n$$\n|C(t) - C_{\\infty}| \\leq 0.01\\,|C(0^{+}) - C_{\\infty}|\n$$\nFrom our solution, we have $C(t) - C_{\\infty} = (C(0) - C_{\\infty})\\exp(-kt)$. Substituting this into the inequality:\n$$\n|(C(0) - C_{\\infty})\\exp(-kt)| \\leq 0.01\\,|C(0) - C_{\\infty}|\n$$\nSince $C(0) = I_0/k$ and $C_{\\infty}=I_1/k$ are different (as $I_0 \\neq I_1$), the term $|C(0) - C_{\\infty}|$ is non-zero and can be cancelled. Also, $\\exp(-kt)$ is always positive. This simplifies the inequality to:\n$$\n\\exp(-kt) \\leq 0.01\n$$\nTo find the minimum time $t_{0.99}$ that satisfies this, we solve the equality:\n$$\n\\exp(-kt_{0.99}) = 0.01\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n-kt_{0.99} = \\ln(0.01)\n$$\nSolving for $t_{0.99}$:\n$$\nt_{0.99} = -\\frac{\\ln(0.01)}{k}\n$$\nSubstituting the given value $k = 0.08$ year$^{-1}$:\n$$\nt_{0.99} = -\\frac{\\ln(0.01)}{0.08} = -\\frac{\\ln(10^{-2})}{0.08} = -\\frac{-2\\ln(10)}{0.08} = \\frac{2\\ln(10)}{0.08}\n$$\nNumerically, $\\ln(0.01) \\approx -4.60517$.\n$$\nt_{0.99} = \\frac{4.60517...}{0.08} \\approx 57.5646... \\text{ years}\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get $57.56$ years.

Multiplying the ODE by the integrating factor gives:\n$$\n\\exp(kt) \\frac{dC}{dt} + k\\exp(kt)C = u_0 \\exp(kt)\n$$\nThe left side is the derivative of a product:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left( C(t)\\exp(kt) \\right) = u_0 \\exp(kt)\n$$\nIntegrating both sides from $0$ to $t$:\n$$\n\\int_0^t \\frac{d}{ds}\\left( C(s)\\exp(ks) \\right) ds = \\int_0^t u_0 \\exp(ks) ds\n$$\n$$\nC(t)\\exp(kt) - C(0)\\exp(0) = u_0 \\left[ \\frac{1}{k}\\exp(ks) \\right]_0^t\n$$\nUsing the initial condition $C(0)=0$:\n$$\nC(t)\\exp(kt) = \\frac{u_0}{k}(\\exp(kt) - \\exp(0)) = \\frac{u_0}{k}(\\exp(kt) - 1)\n$$\nSolving for $C(t)$:\n$$\nC(t) = \\frac{u_0}{k}(1 - \\exp(-kt))\n$$\nThe corresponding output is $y(t) = b C(t) = \\frac{b u_0}{k}(1 - \\exp(-kt))$.\n\nFor the two parameter sets found in Part $2$, the outputs $y_1(t)$ and $y_2(t)$ are:\n$$\ny_1(t) = \\frac{b_1 u_0}{k_1}(1 - \\exp(-k_1 t))\n$$\n$$\ny_2(t) = \\frac{b_2 u_0}{k_2}(1 - \\exp(-k_2 t))\n$$\nSince $b_1/k_1 = b_2/k_2 = 1$, we can simplify these expressions:\n$$\ny_1(t) = u_0(1 - \\exp(-k_1 t))\n$$\n$$\ny_2(t) = u_0(1 - \\exp(-k_2 t))\n$$\nThe difference in outputs is $\\Delta y(t) = y_1(t) - y_2(t)$:\n$$\n\\Delta y(t) = u_0(1 - \\exp(-k_1 t)) - u_0(1 - \\exp(-k_2 t)) = u_0(\\exp(-k_2 t) - \\exp(-k_1 t))\n$$\nTo find the time $t^*$ at which the magnitude of this difference, $|\\Delta y(t)|$, is maximized, we first find the extrema of $\\Delta y(t)$ by setting its derivative with respect to $t$ equal to zero.\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(\\Delta y(t)) = u_0(-k_2 \\exp(-k_2 t) - (-k_1)\\exp(-k_1 t)) = u_0(k_1 \\exp(-k_1 t) - k_2 \\exp(-k_2 t))\n$$\nSetting the derivative to zero at $t = t^*$:\n$$\nk_1 \\exp(-k_1 t^*) - k_2 \\exp(-k_2 t^*) = 0\n$$\n$$\nk_1 \\exp(-k_1 t^*) = k_2 \\exp(-k_2 t^*)\n$$\nTo solve for $t^*$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln(k_1) - k_1 t^* = \\ln(k_2) - k_2 t^*\n$$\n$$\n(k_2 - k_1)t^* = \\ln(k_2) - \\ln(k_1) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_2}{k_1}\\right)\n$$\nThe analytical expression for the time of maximum difference is:\n$$\nt^* = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{k_2}{k_1}\\right)}{k_2 - k_1}\n$$\nSince $k_2=2\\,\\text{day}^{-1}$ and $k_1=1\\,\\text{day}^{-1}$, we have $k_2 > k_1>0$. For $t>0$, $k_2 t > k_1 t$, which implies $-k_2 t < -k_1 t$ and $\\exp(-k_2 t) < \\exp(-k_1 t)$. Thus, $\\Delta y(t)$ is negative for all $t>0$. Maximizing its magnitude $|\\Delta y(t)|$ is equivalent to finding the time of its minimum value, which corresponds to the unique critical point we found.\n\nFinally, we evaluate $t^*$ numerically using the given values $k_1 = 1\\,\\text{day}^{-1}$ and $k_2 = 2\\,\\text{day}^{-1}$:\n$$\nt^* = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{2}{1}\\right)}{2 - 1} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{1} = \\ln(2)\\,\\text{days}\n$$\nNumerically, $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147...$. Rounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$\nt^* \\approx 0.6931\\,\\text{days}\n$$",
