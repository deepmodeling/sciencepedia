            "problem": "A single-compartment neuron in a neuromorphic circuit is modeled as a leaky membrane with capacitance $C_m$ and leak conductance $g_L$, resting at the leak reversal potential $E_L$. In the synaptic integration regime, the combined effect of many excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) can be coarse-grained as an effective constant somatic injection current $I_0$ starting at time $t=0$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the voltage response $V(t)$ of a single-compartment neuron model, the identification and calculation of its membrane time constant $\\tau_m$, and the derivation of the voltage change at $t=\\tau_m$.\n\nFirst, we establish the governing differential equation based on the provided information. According to Kirchhoff's current law, the total injected current $I_0$ must equal the sum of the capacitive current $I_C(t)$ and the leak current $I_L(t)$. The problem states that this is valid for $t \\ge 0$.\n$$I_0 = I_C(t) + I_L(t)$$\nThe expressions for the capacitive and leak currents are given as:\n$$I_C(t) = C_m \\frac{dV}{dt}$$\n$$I_L(t) = g_L (V(t) - E_L)$$\nSubstituting these into the current balance equation yields the first-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the membrane potential $V(t)$:\n$$I_0 = C_m \\frac{dV}{dt} + g_L (V(t) - E_L)$$\nThis equation describes the dynamics of the membrane potential. The neuron is initially at rest, which provides the initial condition $V(0) = E_L$.\n\nTo solve this ODE, we can rearrange it into the standard form for a linear first-order ODE.\n$$C_m \\frac{dV}{dt} = -g_L (V(t) - E_L) + I_0$$\n$$\\frac{dV}{dt} = -\\frac{g_L}{C_m} (V(t) - E_L) + \\frac{I_0}{C_m}$$\n$$\\frac{dV}{dt} + \\frac{g_L}{C_m} V(t) = \\frac{g_L E_L + I_0}{C_m}$$\nThe term multiplying $V(t)$ on the left-hand side has units of inverse time. We identify its reciprocal as the membrane time constant, $\\tau_m$.\n$$\\tau_m = \\frac{C_m}{g_L}$$\nSubstituting $\\tau_m$ back into the ODE gives:\n$$\\frac{dV}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_m} V(t) = \\frac{g_L E_L + I_0}{C_m}$$\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear ODE. We can solve it by finding the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. Alternatively, a change of variables simplifies the process. Let $v(t) = V(t) - E_L$. Then $\\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{dV}{dt}$. The initial condition becomes $v(0) = V(0) - E_L = E_L - E_L = 0$.\nThe original ODE $C_m \\frac{dV}{dt} + g_L (V(t) - E_L) = I_0$ transforms into:\n$$C_m \\frac{dv}{dt} + g_L v(t) = I_0$$\n$$\\frac{dv}{dt} + \\frac{g_L}{C_m} v(t) = \\frac{I_0}{C_m}$$\n$$\\frac{dv}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_m} v(t) = \\frac{I_0}{C_m}$$\nThe general solution for $v(t)$ is the sum of the homogeneous solution $v_h(t)$ and the particular solution $v_p(t)$. The homogeneous equation is $\\frac{dv_h}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_m} v_h(t) = 0$, which has the solution $v_h(t) = A \\exp(-t/\\tau_m)$ for some constant $A$. For a constant input current, we can assume a constant particular solution $v_p(t) = K$. Substituting this into the ODE gives $\\frac{dK}{dt} + \\frac{K}{\\tau_m} = \\frac{I_0}{C_m}$, which simplifies to $\\frac{K}{\\tau_m} = \\frac{I_0}{C_m}$, so $K = \\frac{I_0 \\tau_m}{C_m}$. Using $\\tau_m = C_m/g_L$, we find $K = \\frac{I_0 (C_m/g_L)}{C_m} = \\frac{I_0}{g_L}$.\nThe full solution for $v(t)$ is:\n$$v(t) = v_h(t) + v_p(t) = A \\exp(-t/\\tau_m) + \\frac{I_0}{g_L}$$\nWe use the initial condition $v(0) = 0$ to find the constant $A$:\n$$v(0) = A \\exp(0) + \\frac{I_0}{g_L} = A + \\frac{I_0}{g_L} = 0$$\nThis implies $A = -\\frac{I_0}{g_L}$.\nSubstituting $A$ back, we get the solution for $v(t)$:\n$$v(t) = \\frac{I_0}{g_L} - \\frac{I_0}{g_L} \\exp(-t/\\tau_m) = \\frac{I_0}{g_L} (1 - \\exp(-t/\\tau_m))$$\nFinally, we transform back to the membrane potential $V(t) = v(t) + E_L$:\n$$V(t) = E_L + \\frac{I_0}{g_L} (1 - \\exp(-t/\\tau_m))$$\nThis is the required step response $V(t)$ for $t \\ge 0$. The steady-state voltage as $t \\to \\infty$ is $V_{ss} = E_L + I_0/g_L$.\n\nNow we address the two specific questions.\n\n1. The membrane time constant $\\tau_m$ is given by the expression derived above:\n$$\\tau_m = \\frac{C_m}{g_L}$$\nUsing the provided numerical values:\n$C_m = 200\\,\\mathrm{pF} = 200 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F}$\n$g_L = 10\\,\\mathrm{nS} = 10 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{S}$\n$$\\tau_m = \\frac{200 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F}}{10 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{S}} = 20 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 20\\,\\mathrm{ms}$$\nThe problem requires this value in milliseconds, rounded to three significant figures, which is $20.0\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\n2. The voltage increment is defined as $\\Delta V(t) = V(t) - E_L$. From our derived solution for $V(t)$:\n$$\\Delta V(t) = \\left( E_L + \\frac{I_0}{g_L} (1 - \\exp(-t/\\tau_m)) \\right) - E_L$$\n$$\\Delta V(t) = \\frac{I_0}{g_L} (1 - \\exp(-t/\\tau_m))$$\nWe need to evaluate this at time $t = \\tau_m$:\n$$\\Delta V(\\tau_m) = \\frac{I_0}{g_L} (1 - \\exp(-\\tau_m/\\tau_m))$$\n$$\\Delta V(\\tau_m) = \\frac{I_0}{g_L} (1 - \\exp(-1))$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression in terms of $I_0$ and $g_L$. The units are Volts, since the units of $I_0/g_L$ are Amperes / Siemens = Volts.\n\nThe final answer is a row matrix containing the numerical value of $\\tau_m$ in milliseconds and the analytical expression for $\\Delta V(\\tau_m)$.\nThe first element is $20.0$.\nThe second element is $\\frac{I_0}{g_L}(1 - \\exp(-1))$.",

No rounding is necessary; provide an exact value. The qualitative prediction about $V$ can be explained in your reasoning, but the final reported value must be the net current in nanoamperes.",
            "solution": "The fundamental principle for a conductance-based synapse is that the synaptic current, $I_{syn}$, is proportional to the synaptic conductance, $g_{syn}$, and the driving force. The driving force is the difference between the membrane potential, $V$, and the reversal potential of the synapse, $E_{syn}$. This relationship is expressed as:\n$$I_{syn} \\propto g_{syn} \\cdot (V - E_{syn})$$\nThe problem specifies a linear current-voltage relationship, which is a form of Ohm's law, given by $I = g \\cdot \\Delta V$. The potential difference, or driving force, is $(V - E_{syn})$. Thus, the magnitude of the current is $|I_{syn}| = g_{syn} |V - E_{syn}|$.\n\nThe problem defines the sign convention that an inward current (positive charge flowing into the neuron) is positive. An inward current is depolarizing, meaning it tends to drive the membrane potential $V$ towards more positive values.\nFor an excitatory synapse, with reversal potential $E_E$, typically $E_E > V$. An inward current is generated, which tends to bring $V$ towards $E_E$. To make this current positive, we must define the current as:\n$$I_{syn} = g_{syn}(E_{syn} - V)$$\nLet's verify this convention. For an excitatory synapse ($E_E > V$), $E_E - V > 0$, so $I_E > 0$, which is a positive (inward) current. For an inhibitory synapse with $E_I < V$, $E_I - V < 0$, so $I_I < 0$, which is a negative (outward) current. This matches the convention that outward flow of positive charge is a negative current. For an inhibitory synapse where $V < E_I$ (a shunting or depolarizing inhibition scenario), $E_I - V > 0$, giving a positive (inward) current. In this problem, the inhibitory reversal potential is $E_I = -65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ and the membrane potential is $V = -60\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, so $V > E_I$.
