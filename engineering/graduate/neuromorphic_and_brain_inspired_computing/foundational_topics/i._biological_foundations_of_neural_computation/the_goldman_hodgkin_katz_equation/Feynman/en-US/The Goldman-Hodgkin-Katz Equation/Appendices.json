            "problem": "A spherical mammalian neuron at rest is bathed in an extracellular solution containing $K^+$, $Na^+$, and $Cl^-$. Assume the following biophysically realistic conditions: (i) steady state with zero net transmembrane current, (ii) electroneutrality in bulk solutions, (iii) monovalent ions with valences $z_{K}=+1$, $z_{Na}=+1$, and $z_{Cl}=-1$, (iv) spatially uniform electric field across the thin membrane (constant-field approximation), and (v) ionic activities equal their concentrations. The intracellular and extracellular concentrations are $[K^+]_i = 140\\ \\mathrm{mM}$, $[K^+]_o = 5\\ \\mathrm{mM}$, $[Na^+]_i = 10\\ \\mathrm{mM}$, $[Na^+]_o = 145\\ \\mathrm{mM}$, $[Cl^-]_i = 10\\ \\mathrm{mM}$, and $[Cl^-]_o = 110\\ \\mathrm{mM}$. The relative membrane permeabilities satisfy $P_K : P_{Na} : P_{Cl} = 1 : 0.05 : 0.45$. The temperature is $37^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$. \n\nStarting from the definition of electrochemical potential $\\tilde{\\mu}_i$ and the requirement of zero net transmembrane current under the constant-field approximation, derive a general expression for the steady-state membrane potential $V_m$ of a membrane permeable to the three ions. Then, using the given concentrations and permeabilities, compute the resting membrane potential. Express your final value in millivolts and round your answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The electrochemical potential of ion $i$ is given by\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mu}_i = \\mu_i^0 + RT \\ln([i]) + z_i F \\phi,\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $F$ is the Faraday constant, $z_i$ is the ionic valence, $[i]$ is the activity (taken equal to concentration), and $\\phi$ is the electric potential. For a membrane selectively permeable to a single ion, equality of electrochemical potentials across the membrane yields the Nernst relation for the equilibrium potential of that ion. However, at the resting state of a real neuron, multiple ions contribute to current, and the membrane potential adjusts such that the net current is zero.\n\nUnder the constant-field approximation (spatially uniform electric field across the membrane thickness), electrodiffusive fluxes of monovalent ions across the membrane have the form that leads to the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) current description. Imposing the steady-state condition of zero net transmembrane current,\n$$\n\\sum_i I_i = 0,\n$$\nwith $I_i$ the current carried by ion $i$, and using the constant-field expression for ionic fluxes, one obtains the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) voltage equation for monovalent ions:\n$$\nV_m = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln\\!\\left( \\frac{P_K [K^+]_o + P_{Na} [Na^+]_o + P_{Cl} [Cl^-]_i}{P_K [K^+]_i + P_{Na} [Na^+]_i + P_{Cl} [Cl^-]_o} \\right),\n$$\nwhere $P_i$ are the permeability coefficients, and the placement of $[Cl^-]_i$ and $[Cl^-]_o$ in the numerator and denominator, respectively, reflects the negative valence of chloride.\n\nWe now compute $V_m$ numerically using the provided values.

Glial cells, such as astrocytes, provide a key physiological example where the membrane is overwhelmingly permeable to a single ion species.\n\nConsider a simplified model of an astrocyte at a physiological temperature of $310.15$ K.

The GHK equation describes the membrane potential based on the concentration gradients and relative permeabilities of multiple ion species.\n\nThe GHK equation is given by:\n$$V_m = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{P_K[K^+]_{out} + P_{Na}[Na^+]_{out} + P_{Cl}[Cl^-]_{in}}{P_K[K^+]_{in} + P_{Na}[Na^+]_{in} + P_{Cl}[Cl^-]_{out}} \\right)$$\nNote that for the chloride ion ($Cl^-$), which has a negative charge (valence $z=-1$), the intracellular and extracellular concentrations are inverted within the fraction compared to the positive ions ($K^+$ and $Na^+$, with valence $z=+1$).\n\nFirst, we will calculate the pre-logarithmic factor, $\\frac{RT}{F}$, in volts and then convert it to millivolts.\nGiven values are:\n- $R = 8.314 \\text{ J} \\cdot \\text{mol}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{K}^{-1}$\n- $T = 310.15 \\text{ K}$\n- $F = 96485 \\text{ C} \\cdot \\text{mol}^{-1}$\n\n$$ \\frac{RT}{F} = \\frac{(8.314 \\text{ J} \\cdot \\text{mol}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{K}^{-1})(310.15 \\text{ K})}{96485 \\text{ C} \\cdot \\text{mol}^{-1}} \\approx 0.026734 \\text{ V} = 26.734 \\text{ mV} $$\n\nNext, we evaluate the terms in the numerator and denominator of the fraction inside the natural logarithm. The relative permeabilities are given as $P_K=1$, $P_{Na}=0.001$, and $P_{Cl}=0.001$. The concentrations are given in mM, but since they appear as ratios, the units will cancel out.\n\nNumerator calculation:\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = P_K[K^+]_{out} + P_{Na}[Na^+]_{out} + P_{Cl}[Cl^-]_{in} $$\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = (1)(4.0) + (0.001)(145.0) + (0.001)(5.0) $$\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = 4.0 + 0.145 + 0.005 = 4.15 $$\n\nDenominator calculation:\n$$ \\text{Denominator} = P_K[K^+]_{in} + P_{Na}[Na^+]_{in} + P_{Cl}[Cl^-]_{out} $$\n$$ \\text{Denominator} = (1)(140.0) + (0.001)(12.0) + (0.001)(120.0) $$\n$$ \\text{Denominator} = 140.0 + 0.012 + 0.12 = 140.132 $$\n\nNow, we can substitute these values back into the GHK equation:\n$$ V_m = (26.734 \\text{ mV}) \\ln \\left( \\frac{4.15}{140.132} \\right) $$\n$$ V_m = (26.734 \\text{ mV}) \\ln(0.0296144...) $$\n$$ V_m \\approx (26.734 \\text{ mV})(-3.5194) $$\n$$ V_m \\approx -94.086 \\text{ mV} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ V_m \\approx -94.1 \\text{ mV} $$\n\nThis result demonstrates a key principle. In this astrocyte model, the permeability to potassium ($P_K$) is vastly greater than for sodium ($P_{Na}$) and chloride ($P_{Cl}$). As a consequence, the membrane potential is dominated by the potassium ion gradient. To verify this, we can calculate the Nernst potential for potassium ($E_K$), which is the equilibrium potential for a membrane permeable only to $K^+$:\n$$ E_K = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{[K^+]_{out}}{[K^+]_{in}} \\right) = (26.734 \\text{ mV}) \\ln \\left( \\frac{4.0}{140.0} \\right) = (26.734 \\text{ mV}) \\ln \\left( \\frac{1}{35} \\right) $$\n$$ E_K \\approx (26.734 \\text{ mV})(-3.5553) \\approx -95.03 \\text{ mV} $$\nOur calculated GHK potential of $-94.1 \\text{ mV}$ is very close to the Nernst potential for potassium of $-95.0 \\text{ mV}$. The small deviation is due to the minor, but non-zero, permeabilities to $Na^+$ and $Cl^-$. This confirms that under conditions of dominant potassium permeability, the GHK equation effectively simplifies to the Nernst equation for potassium.",
