It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information to proceed with a solution.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\nThe Nernst potential, or reversal potential $E_i$, for an ionic species $i$ is the membrane potential $V_m = V_{\\mathrm{in}} - V_{\\mathrm{out}}$ at which there is no net flow of that ion across the membrane. This equilibrium condition is met when the electrochemical potential, $\\tilde{\\mu}_i$, is the same in the internal and external compartments.\n\nThe electrochemical potential for an ionic species $i$ in an ideal, dilute solution is given by:\n$$ \\tilde{\\mu}_i = \\mu_i^0 + RT \\ln(c_i) + z_i F V $$\nwhere $\\mu_i^0$ is the standard chemical potential, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $c_i$ is the molar concentration of the ion, $z_i$ is its valence, $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $V$ is the electrical potential of the compartment.\n\nAt equilibrium, $\\tilde{\\mu}_{i, \\mathrm{in}} = \\tilde{\\mu}_{i, \\mathrm{out}}$:\n$$ \\mu_i^0 + RT \\ln(c_{i, \\mathrm{in}}) + z_i F V_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\mu_i^0 + RT \\ln(c_{i, \\mathrm{out}}) + z_i F V_{\\mathrm{out}} $$\nThe standard potential $\\mu_i^0$ cancels. Rearranging the terms to solve for the potential difference $V_{\\mathrm{in}} - V_{\\mathrm{out}}$:\n$$ z_i F (V_{\\mathrm{in}} - V_{\\mathrm{out}}) = RT \\ln(c_{i, \\mathrm{out}}) - RT \\ln(c_{i, \\mathrm{in}}) $$\n$$ z_i F (V_{\\mathrm{in}} - V_{\\mathrm{out}}) = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{c_{i, \\mathrm{out}}}{c_{i, \\mathrm{in}}}\\right) $$\nThe Nernst potential $E_i$ is this specific potential difference:\n$$ E_i = V_{\\mathrm{in}} - V_{\\mathrm{out}} = \\frac{RT}{z_i F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{c_{i, \\mathrm{out}}}{c_{i, \\mathrm{in}}}\\right) $$\nThis equation shows that the reversal potential is inversely proportional to the valence $z_i$, as mentioned in the problem description.\n\nWe are given that for all three ions, the concentration ratio $\\frac{c_{\\mathrm{out}}}{c_{\\mathrm{in}}} = \\rho$, and $\\rho  1$. Let's define a positive constant factor $K = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln(\\rho)$. Since $R, T, F$ are positive constants and $\\rho  1$, we have $\\ln(\\rho)  0$, and therefore $K  0$. The Nernst equation for any species $i$ simplifies to:\n$$ E_i = \\frac{K}{z_i} $$\n\nNow, we calculate the specific reversal potential for each ion:\n\n1.  **For the cation $X^+$**:\n    The valence is $z_{X^+} = +1$.\n    $$ E_{X^+} = \\frac{RT}{(+1)F} \\ln(\\rho) = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln(\\rho) = K $$\n\n2.  **For the anion $Y^-$**:\n    The valence is $z_{Y^-} = -1$.\n    $$ E_{Y^-} = \\frac{RT}{(-1)F} \\ln(\\rho) = -\\frac{RT}{F} \\ln(\\rho) = -K $$\n\n3.  **For the cation $Z^{2+}$**:\n    The valence is $z_{Z^{2+}} = +2$.\n    $$ E_{Z^{2+}} = \\frac{RT}{(+2)F} \\ln(\\rho) = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln(\\rho) = \\frac{K}{2} $$\n\nNow we can establish the relationships between these potentials:\n- Comparing $E_{Y^-}$ and $E_{X^+}$: We have $E_{Y^-} = -K$ and $E_{X^+} = K$. Therefore, $E_{Y^-} = -E_{X^+}$.\n- Comparing $E_{X^+}$ and $E_{Z^{2+}}$: We have $E_{X^+} = K$ and $E_{Z^{2+}} = K/2$. Therefore, $E_{X^+} = 2 E_{Z^{2+}}$.\n\nThe two relationships are:\n- $E_{X^+} = 2 E_{Z^{2+}}$\n- $E_{Y^-} = -E_{X^+}$\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\nA. $E_{X^+} = E_{Z^{2+}}$, and $E_{Y^-} = - E_{X^+}$\nThe first part, $E_{X^+} = E_{Z^{2+}}$, is incorrect. Our derivation shows $E_{X^+} = 2 E_{Z^{2+}}$ because the Nernst potential is inversely proportional to the valence ($1/z$). The second part is correct. Since one part is false, the option is **Incorrect**.\n\nB. $E_{X^+} = 2 E_{Z^{2+}}$, and $E_{Y^-} = - E_{X^+}$\nThe first part, $E_{X^+} = 2 E_{Z^{2+}}$, is correct as per our derivation. The second part, $E_{Y^-} = - E_{X^+}$, is also correct, reflecting the opposite valences of the ions. Both parts are correct. The option is **Correct**.\n\nC. $E_{X^+} = \\dfrac{1}{2} E_{Z^{2+}}$, and $E_{Y^-} = + E_{X^+}$\nThe first part, $E_{X^+} = \\frac{1}{2} E_{Z^{2+}}$, is incorrect. This inverts the correct relationship. The second part, $E_{Y^-} = + E_{X^+}$, is incorrect. An anion and a cation with the same concentration ratio must have oppositely signed Nernst potentials. Both parts are false. The option is **Incorrect**.\n\nD. $\\lvert E_{Z^{2+}} \\rvert = 2 \\lvert E_{X^+} \\rvert$, and $E_{Y^-} = - E_{X^+}$\nThe first part, $\\lvert E_{Z^{2+}} \\rvert = 2 \\lvert E_{X^+} \\rvert$, is incorrect. Since $\\rho  1$, both $E_{X^+}$ and $E_{Z^{2+}}$ are positive. We found $E_{X^+} = 2 E_{Z^{2+}}$. Taking the absolute value gives $\\lvert E_{X^+} \\rvert = 2 \\lvert E_{Z^{2+}} \\rvert$. This option states the inverse. The second part is correct. Since one part is false, the option is **Incorrect**.\n\nE. $E_{X^+} = 2 E_{Z^{2+}}$, and $E_{Y^-} = + E_{X^+}$\nThe first part, $E_{X^+} = 2 E_{Z^{2+}}$, is correct. The second part, $E_{Y^-} = + E_{X^+}$, is incorrect. Their potentials must have opposite signs. Since one part is false, the option is **Incorrect**.",

Let's denote the free concentrations of intracellular calcium, buffer, and complex as $[{\\text{Ca}^{2+}}]$, $[B]$, and $[{\\text{Ca}}B]$, respectively.\n\nThe conservation equations are:\n$$\n[{\\text{Ca}^{2+}}]_{\\text{tot,in}} = [{\\text{Ca}^{2+}}] + [{\\text{Ca}}B]\n$$\n$$\n[B]_{\\text{tot,in}} = [B] + [{\\text{Ca}}B]\n$$\nThe activity-based dissociation constant is:\n$$\nK_{d} = \\frac{a_{\\text{Ca}^{2+}} \\, a_{B}}{a_{\\text{Ca}B}} = \\frac{(\\gamma_{\\text{Ca}^{2+},\\text{in}} [{\\text{Ca}^{2+}}]) \\, (\\gamma_{B,\\text{in}} [B])}{\\gamma_{\\text{Ca}B,\\text{in}} [{\\text{Ca}}B]}\n$$\nGiven $\\gamma_{B,\\text{in}} = 1$ and $\\gamma_{\\text{Ca}B,\\text{in}} = 1$, the equation simplifies to:\n$$\nK_{d} = \\frac{\\gamma_{\\text{Ca}^{2+},\\text{in}} [{\\text{Ca}^{2+}}] [B]}{[{\\text{Ca}}B]}\n$$\nFrom the conservation equations, we express $[{\\text{Ca}}B]$ and $[B]$ in terms of $[{\\text{Ca}^{2+}}]$:\n$$\n[{\\text{Ca}}B] = [{\\text{Ca}^{2+}}]_{\\text{tot,in}} - [{\\text{Ca}^{2+}}]\n$$\n$$\n[B] = [B]_{\\text{tot,in}} - [{\\text{Ca}}B] = [B]_{\\text{tot,in}} - ([{\\text{Ca}^{2+}}]_{\\text{tot,in}} - [{\\text{Ca}^{2+}}])\n$$\nSubstituting these into the dissociation constant equation:\n$$\nK_{d} = \\frac{\\gamma_{\\text{Ca}^{2+},\\text{in}} [{\\text{Ca}^{2+}}] \\left( [B]_{\\text{tot,in}} - [{\\text{Ca}^{2+}}]_{\\text{tot,in}} + [{\\text{Ca}^{2+}}] \\right)}{[{\\text{Ca}^{2+}}]_{\\text{tot,in}} - [{\\text{Ca}^{2+}}]}\n$$\nRearranging this yields a quadratic equation for $[{\\text{Ca}^{2+}}]$ of the form $ax^2+bx+c=0$, where $x = [{\\text{Ca}^{2+}}]$:\n$$\n(\\gamma_{\\text{Ca}^{2+},\\text{in}}) [{\\text{Ca}^{2+}}]^2 + (\\gamma_{\\text{Ca}^{2+},\\text{in}}([B]_{\\text{tot,in}} - [{\\text{Ca}^{2+}}]_{\\text{tot,in}}) + K_{d}) [{\\text{Ca}^{2+}}] - K_{d}[{\\text{Ca}^{2+}}]_{\\text{tot,in}} = 0\n$$\nLet's substitute the given values to find the coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$:\n- $[{\\text{Ca}^{2+}}]_{\\text{tot,in}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}$\n- $[B]_{\\text{tot,in}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}$\n- $K_{d} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-7} \\ \\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}$\n- $\\gamma_{\\text{Ca}^{2+},\\text{in}} = 0.35$\n\nThe coefficients are:\n$$\na = 0.35\n$$\n$$\nb = 0.35 \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-3} - 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}) + 1.5 \\times 10^{-7} = 0.35 \\times (9.0 \\times 10^{-4}) + 1.5 \\times 10^{-7} = 3.15 \\times 10^{-4} + 1.5 \\times 10^{-7} = 3.1515 \\times 10^{-4}\n$$\n$$\nc = -(1.5 \\times 10^{-7}) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-4}) = -1.5 \\times 10^{-11}\n$$\nSolving the quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ for the physically meaningful positive root $x = \\frac{-b + \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$\nb^2 - 4ac = (3.1515 \\times 10^{-4})^2 - 4(0.35)(-1.5 \\times 10^{-11}) \\approx 9.93195 \\times 10^{-8} + 2.1 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx 9.93405 \\times 10^{-8}\n$$\n$$\n\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \\approx \\sqrt{9.93405 \\times 10^{-8}} \\approx 3.15183 \\times 10^{-4}\n$$\n$$\n[{\\text{Ca}^{2+}}] = \\frac{-3.1515 \\times 10^{-4} + 3.15183 \\times 10^{-4}}{2 \\times 0.35} \\approx \\frac{3.3 \\times 10^{-8}}{0.7} \\approx 4.7594 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}\n$$\nSo, the free intracellular calcium concentration is $[{\\text{Ca}^{2+}}]_{\\text{in,free}} \\approx 4.7594 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}$.\n\nNow we can find the intracellular activity:\n$$\na_{\\text{Ca}^{2+},\\text{in}} = \\gamma_{\\text{Ca}^{2+},\\text{in}} [{\\text{Ca}^{2+}}]_{\\text{in,free}} = 0.35 \\times (4.7594 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}) \\approx 1.6658 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}\n$$\n\n**2.
