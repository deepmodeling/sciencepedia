A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Inter-Spike Interval (ISI)\n\nThe governing differential equation for the membrane potential $V(t)$ is:\n$$C \\frac{dV(t)}{dt} = -\\frac{V(t) - V_L}{R} + I_0$$\nUsing the definitions $\\tau_m = RC$ and $V_\\infty = V_L + RI_0$, we can rewrite the equation as:\n$$RC \\frac{dV}{dt} = -(V - V_L) + RI_0$$\n$$\\tau_m \\frac{dV}{dt} = -V + V_L + RI_0 = -(V - (V_L + RI_0))$$\n$$\\tau_m \\frac{dV}{dt} = V_\\infty - V(t)$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by separating variables, for a time interval starting at $t_0$ with initial voltage $V(t_0) = V_0$:\n$$\\int_{V_0}^{V(t)} \\frac{dV'}{V_\\infty - V'} = \\int_{t_0}^{t} \\frac{dt'}{\\tau_m}$$\nNote that since the neuron is in the suprathreshold regime ($V_\\infty  V_{\\mathrm{th}}$) and the voltage evolves from a reset potential below threshold towards the threshold, we have $V(t)  V_{\\mathrm{th}}  V_\\infty$. Thus, the term $V_\\infty - V'$ is always positive.\n$$[-\\ln(V_\\infty - V')]_{V_0}^{V(t)} = \\frac{t - t_0}{\\tau_m}$$\n$$\\ln(V_\\infty - V_0) - \\ln(V_\\infty - V(t)) = \\frac{t - t_0}{\\tau_m}$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{V_\\infty - V_0}{V_\\infty - V(t)}\\right) = \\frac{t - t_0}{\\tau_m}$$\nLet $T_{\\mathrm{rise}}$ be the time it takes for the voltage to rise from the reset potential $V_0$ to the threshold $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$. The integration starts after the refractory period, so we can set $t_0 = 0$ for this phase. At $t = T_{\\mathrm{rise}}$, we have $V(T_{\\mathrm{rise}}) = V_{\\mathrm{th}}$.\n$$T_{\\mathrm{rise}} = \\tau_m \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_\\infty - V_0}{V_\\infty - V_{\\mathrm{th}}}\\right)$$\nThe total inter-spike interval (ISI), $T$, is the sum of the rise time and the absolute refractory period $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}}$:\n$$T = \\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}} + T_{\\mathrm{rise}} = \\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}} + \\tau_m \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_\\infty - V_0}{V_\\infty - V_{\\mathrm{th}}}\\right)$$\nNow we apply the specific reset rules to find the initial voltage $V_0$.\n\n**Hard Reset:** The voltage is reset to a fixed value $V_r$. So, $V_0 = V_r$.\nThe ISI is:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{hard}} = \\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}} + \\tau_m \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_\\infty - V_r}{V_\\infty - V_{\\mathrm{th}}}\\right)$$\n\n**Soft Reset:** The voltage is reduced by an amount $\\Delta$ from its value at the moment of the spike. Since the spike is detected exactly at $V(t_s) = V_{\\mathrm{th}}$, the reset potential is $V_0 = V_{\\mathrm{th}} - \\Delta$.\nThe ISI is:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{soft}} = \\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}} + \\tau_m \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_\\infty - (V_{\\mathrm{th}} - \\Delta)}{V_\\infty - V_{\\mathrm{th}}}\\right)$$\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The inter-spike interval (including refractory) under hard reset is $T_{\\mathrm{hard}} = \\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}} + \\tau_m \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{V_\\infty - V_r}{V_\\infty - V_{\\mathrm{th}}}\\right)$, and under soft reset is $T_{\\mathrm{soft}} = \\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}} + \\tau_m \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{V_\\infty - (V_{\\mathrm{th}} - \\Delta)}{V_\\infty - V_{\\mathrm{th}}}\\right)$. Moreover, $T_{\\mathrm{soft}}  T_{\\mathrm{hard}}$ if and only if $\\Delta  V_{\\mathrm{th}} - V_r$.**\n\nThe derived expressions for $T_{\\mathrm{hard}}$ and $T_{\\mathrm{soft}}$ match exactly with those given in the option.\nNow, we test the inequality $T_{\\mathrm{soft}}  T_{\\mathrm{hard}}$:\n$$\\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}} + \\tau_m \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_\\infty - (V_{\\mathrm{th}} - \\Delta)}{V_\\infty - V_{\\mathrm{th}}}\\right)  \\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}} + \\tau_m \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_\\infty - V_r}{V_\\infty - V_{\\mathrm{th}}}\\right)$$\nSince $\\tau_m  0$ and the logarithm function $\\ln(x)$ is strictly increasing, this is equivalent to:\n$$\\frac{V_\\infty - (V_{\\mathrm{th}} - \\Delta)}{V_\\infty - V_{\\mathrm{th}}}  \\frac{V_\\infty - V_r}{V_\\infty - V_{\\mathrm{th}}}$$\nThe denominator $V_\\infty - V_{\\mathrm{th}}$ is positive under the suprathreshold condition, so we can multiply both sides by it without changing the inequality:\n$$V_\\infty - V_{\\mathrm{th}} + \\Delta  V_\\infty - V_r$$\n$$-V_{\\mathrm{th}} + \\Delta  -V_r$$\n$$\\Delta  V_{\\mathrm{th}} - V_r$$\nThe condition stated in the option is correct. Thus, the entire statement is correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Under soft reset, the inter-spike interval is $T_{\\mathrm{soft}} = \\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}} + \\tau_m \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{V_\\infty - V_r}{V_\\infty - (V_{\\mathrm{th}} + \\Delta)}\\right)$, so that soft reset is equivalent to increasing the threshold by $\\Delta$.**\n\nOur derived expression is $T_{\\mathrm{soft}} = \\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}} + \\tau_m \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_\\infty - (V_{\\mathrm{th}} - \\Delta)}{V_\\infty - V_{\\mathrm{th}}}\\right)$. This does not match the expression in the option. The option's formula incorrectly uses $V_r$ in the numerator and modifies the threshold term in the denominator. The interpretation that soft reset is equivalent to increasing the threshold to $V_{\\mathrm{th}} + \\Delta$ is also incorrect; soft reset modifies the reset potential to $V_{\\mathrm{th}} - \\Delta$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. For constant current drive $I_0$, hard and soft reset yield identical steady firing rates for any $\\Delta$, because the subthreshold trajectory between spikes is memoryless.**\n\nSteady firing rate is the reciprocal of the ISI, $f = 1/T$. For the firing rates to be identical, the ISIs must be identical: $T_{\\mathrm{hard}} = T_{\\mathrm{soft}}$. From our analysis of option A, this equality holds if and only if $\\Delta = V_{\\mathrm{th}} - V_r$. For any other value of $\\Delta$, the ISIs are different. The claim that this holds \"for any $\\Delta$\" is false. The reasoning provided is also flawed; while the underlying differential equation is memoryless, the starting condition (the reset potential) differs between the two schemes, which affects the trajectory duration.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Soft reset always reduces the steady firing rate relative to hard reset, because it increases the effective threshold from $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$ to $V_{\\mathrm{th}} + \\Delta$.**\n\nReducing the firing rate means increasing the ISI, so this option claims $T_{\\mathrm{soft}}  T_{\\mathrm{hard}}$ is always true. As shown in the analysis for option A, the relationship depends on the comparison between $\\Delta$ and $V_{\\mathrm{th}} - V_r$:\n- If $\\Delta  V_{\\mathrm{th}} - V_r$, then $T_{\\mathrm{soft}}  T_{\\mathrm{hard}}$ (higher firing rate).\n- If $\\Delta  V_{\\mathrm{th}} - V_r$, then $T_{\\mathrm{soft}}  T_{\\mathrm{hard}}$ (lower firing rate).\n- If $\\Delta = V_{\\mathrm{th}} - V_r$, then $T_{\\mathrm{soft}} = T_{\\mathrm{hard}}$ (same firing rate).\nTherefore, the claim that it *always* reduces the firing rate is false. The justification is also false, as soft reset does not increase the effective threshold.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Immediately after the refractory period, the gap to threshold equals $V_{\\mathrm{th}} - V_r$ under hard reset and equals $\\Delta$ under soft reset (assuming the spike is detected at $V(t_s) = V_{\\mathrm{th}}$). Thus, for $\\Delta  V_{\\mathrm{th}} - V_r$, subsequent integration of incoming feedforward synaptic currents requires less depolarization under soft reset, making near-threshold post-synaptic inputs more effective at eliciting the next spike than under hard reset.**\n\nThe \"gap to threshold\" is the difference between the threshold voltage and the post-reset voltage, $V_{\\mathrm{th}} - V_0$.\n- For hard reset, $V_0 = V_r$. The gap is $V_{\\mathrm{th}} - V_r$. This is correct.\n- For soft reset, $V_0 = V_{\\mathrm{th}} - \\Delta$. The gap is $V_{\\mathrm{th}} - (V_{\\mathrm{th}} - \\Delta) = \\Delta$. This is correct.\nThe condition $\\Delta  V_{\\mathrm{th}} - V_r$ means the voltage gap to threshold is smaller for soft reset than for hard reset. A smaller voltage gap implies that the neuron is closer to its firing threshold. Consequently, it requires a smaller additional depolarization to reach threshold. This makes the neuron more sensitive or responsive to subsequent inputs, as a given input will have a greater relative effect. The physical interpretation is logically sound and follows directly from the mathematical result.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**F. If $\\Delta = V_{\\mathrm{th}} - V_r$, soft reset becomes exactly equivalent to hard reset in the ideal LIF model with instantaneous threshold detection and no spike overshoot, so they produce identical inter-spike intervals for all $I_0$ in the suprathreshold regime.**\n\nLet's examine the reset potential $V_0$ under soft reset with the condition $\\Delta = V_{\\mathrm{th}} - V_r$.\nThe soft reset potential is $V_0 = V_{\\mathrm{th}} - \\Delta$. Substituting the condition:\n$$V_0 = V_{\\mathrm{th}} - (V_{\\mathrm{th}} - V_r) = V_r$$\nThis shows that under this specific condition, the reset potential for soft reset is exactly equal to the reset potential for hard reset. Since the differential equation, threshold, and refractory period are identical for both cases, if their initial conditions (reset potentials) are also identical, their entire subsequent dynamics must be identical. This means a spike will be produced after the same amount of time, leading to identical inter-spike intervals, $T_{\\mathrm{soft}} = T_{\\mathrm{hard}}$, for any given suprathreshold input $I_0$. This is confirmed by substituting $\\Delta = V_{\\mathrm{th}} - V_r$ into the formula for $T_{\\mathrm{soft}}$ from option A, which makes it identical to the formula for $T_{\\mathrm{hard}}$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**",

In that scenario, the constraint equation would become $0 = \\vartheta$, which contradicts the given condition $\\vartheta  0$. Therefore, we must have $\\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\left( \\kappa(t^{*} - t_{k}) \\right)^2  0$.\n\nFinally, we substitute the expression for $\\frac{\\lambda}{2}$ back into the equation for $w_{k}$:\n$$ w_{k} = \\left( \\frac{\\vartheta}{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\left( \\kappa(t^{*} - t_{j}) \\right)^2} \\right) \\kappa(t^{*} - t_{k}) $$\nHere, we use $j$ as the summation index to avoid confusion with the component index $k$.\n\nThis gives the expression for each component of the unique weight vector $\\boldsymbol{w}$ of minimum Euclidean norm. Geometrically, the constraint equation defines a hyperplane in the $N$-dimensional weight space, and the derived vector $\\boldsymbol{w}$ is the coordinate vector of the point on this hyperplane that is closest to the origin.\n\nThe final answer, expressed as a row vector $\\boldsymbol{w} = (w_{1}, \\dots, w_{N})$, can be written by factoring out the common scalar multiple:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{w} = \\frac{\\vartheta}{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\left(\\kappa(t^{*} - t_{j})\\right)^2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\kappa(t^{*} - t_{1})  \\kappa(t^{*} - t_{2})  \\dots  \\kappa(t^{*} - t_{N}) \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis represents the complete solution in closed form as requested.",
