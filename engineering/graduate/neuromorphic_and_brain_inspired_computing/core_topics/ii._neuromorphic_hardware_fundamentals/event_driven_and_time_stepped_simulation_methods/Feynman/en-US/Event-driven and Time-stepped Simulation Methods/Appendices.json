In the time-stepped simulation, discretization introduces errors. Any non-zero circular variance $V$ can be attributed to these errors. The problem directs us to consider only the error from spike time quantization.\n\nThe derivation proceeds as follows.\nLet $t_k^{\\star}$ be the exact time of the $k$-th threshold crossing. In the time-stepped simulation, the membrane potential is only checked at discrete times $t_n = n\\Delta t$. A spike is registered at the first grid time $t_k^{\\Delta}$ such that $V(t_k^{\\Delta}) \\ge V_{\\mathrm{th}}$.

This is equivalent to $t_k^{\\Delta} = \\lceil t_k^{\\star}/\\Delta t \\rceil \\Delta t$.\n\nThe timing error for the $k$-th spike is $e_k = t_k^{\\Delta} - t_k^{\\star}$. The problem states that the ratio $T/\\Delta t$ is irrational. For a perfectly periodic underlying process with period $T$, the sequence of exact spike times modulo the time step, $t_k^{\\star} \\pmod{\\Delta t}$, is uniformly distributed over the interval $[0, \\Delta t)$ due to Weyl's criterion on equidistribution.

Since $\\delta_k$ is a random variable uniformly distributed over $[0, \\Delta t)$, the error $e_k$ is a random variable, let's call it $\\varepsilon$, uniformly distributed over $(0, \\Delta t]$. For the purpose of integration, we can treat its probability density function as $p(\\varepsilon) = 1/\\Delta t$ for $\\varepsilon \\in [0, \\Delta t]$ and $0$ otherwise.\n\nThe phase of the $k$-th spike in the time-stepped simulation is $\\phi_k^{\\Delta}$.
