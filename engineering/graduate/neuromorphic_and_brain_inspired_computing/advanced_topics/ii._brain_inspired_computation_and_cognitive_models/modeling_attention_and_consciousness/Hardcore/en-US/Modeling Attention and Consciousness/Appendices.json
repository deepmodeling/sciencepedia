            "problem": "A neuromorphic attention module applies a multiplicative gain to specific feature channels to prioritize task-relevant inputs. Consider a single-channel linear readout modeled as follows. Let the latent stimulus-aligned signal be a zero-mean, second-order stationary process with power $P_{s} = \\mathbb{E}[s^{2}(t)]$ that is independent of noise. The attention mechanism applies a static, nonnegative gain $g \\geq 0$ to the signal path only, producing an output\n$$\ny_{g}(t) = g\\,s(t) + n(t),\n$$\nwhere $n(t)$ is additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) with zero mean and variance $\\sigma^{2}$ that is independent of $s(t)$ and is not modulated by the gain.

            "solution": "The task is to derive the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement factor $R(g)$ and the minimal gain threshold $g_{\\text{th}}$ for which the SNR strictly improves. We begin from the first principles laid out in the problem statement.\n\nThe output of the neuromorphic attention module is given by the linear model:\n$$y_{g}(t) = g\\,s(t) + n(t)$$\nwhere $s(t)$ is the stimulus-aligned signal, $n(t)$ is the additive noise, and $g$ is the multiplicative gain applied only to the signal path. The gain is nonnegative, so $g \\geq 0$.\n\nThe problem specifies that the SNR is defined as the ratio of signal power to noise power at the output.\nFirst, let's identify the signal and noise components at the output. Based on the structure of the model, the signal component is $g\\,s(t)$ and the noise component is $n(t)$.\n\nThe power of the signal component at the output, which we denote $P_{\\text{signal}, g}$, is the expected value of its square. Since $g$ is a deterministic constant:\n$$P_{\\text{signal}, g} = \\mathbb{E}\\left[ (g\\,s(t))^{2} \\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[ g^{2}s^{2}(t) \\right] = g^{2}\\mathbb{E}\\left[ s^{2}(t) \\right]$$\nThe problem states that the latent signal $s(t)$ is a zero-mean process with power $P_{s} = \\mathbb{E}[s^{2}(t)]$. Substituting this into our expression, we get:\n$$P_{\\text{signal}, g} = g^{2}P_{s}$$\n\nThe power of the noise component at the output, $P_{\\text{noise}, g}$, is the power of the additive noise process $n(t)$. The problem states that $n(t)$ is additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) with zero mean and variance $\\sigma^{2}$. The power of a zero-mean process is equal to its variance. Therefore:\n$$P_{\\text{noise}, g} = \\mathbb{E}\\left[ n^{2}(t) \\right] = \\sigma^{2}$$\nAs specified, the noise power is not modulated by the gain $g$.\n\nNow, we can express the SNR for a given gain $g$, denoted $\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{with gain } g}$, as the ratio of the signal power to the noise power at the output:\n$$\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{with gain } g} = \\frac{P_{\\text{signal}, g}}{P_{\\text{noise}, g}} = \\frac{g^{2}P_{s}}{\\sigma^{2}}$$\n\nNext, we establish the baseline SNR. The baseline condition is defined for a gain of $g=1$. Substituting $g=1$ into the general SNR expression yields the baseline SNR, $\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{baseline}}$:\n$$\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{baseline}} = \\frac{1^{2}P_{s}}{\\sigma^{2}} = \\frac{P_{s}}{\\sigma^{2}}$$\n\nThe SNR improvement factor, $R(g)$, is defined as the ratio of the SNR with gain $g$ to the baseline SNR:\n$$R(g) \\triangleq \\frac{\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{with gain } g}}{\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{baseline}}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above:\n$$R(g) = \\frac{\\frac{g^{2}P_{s}}{\\sigma^{2}}}{\\frac{P_{s}}{\\sigma^{2}}}$$\nAssuming that the signal power $P_{s}$ and noise power $\\sigma^{2}$ are both greater than zero (which is implicit for a meaningful SNR calculation), we can cancel the term $\\frac{P_{s}}{\\sigma^{2}}$:\n$$R(g) = g^{2}$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the SNR improvement factor expressed solely in terms of $g$.\n\nFor the second part of the problem, we must find the minimal gain threshold $g_{\\text{th}}$ for which the SNR strictly improves relative to the baseline. A strict improvement occurs when the SNR with gain $g$ is strictly greater than the baseline SNR, which is equivalent to the condition $R(g) > 1$.\nUsing our derived expression for $R(g)$, we have the inequality:\n$$g^{2} > 1$$\nWe are given that the gain $g$ is a nonnegative value, i.e., $g \\geq 0$. The solution to the inequality $g^{2} > 1$ under the constraint $g \\geq 0$ is:\n$$g > 1$$\nThe problem asks for the minimal gain threshold, $g_{\\text{th}}$, which is the boundary point of the region of strict improvement. For any gain $g$ strictly greater than this threshold, the SNR must improve. The condition $g>1$ implies that this threshold value is:\n$$g_{\\text{th}} = 1$$\nAt $g=1$, $R(1)=1$, representing no change from baseline. For any $g>1$, $R(g)>1$, representing a strict improvement. For any $0 \\leq g < 1$, $R(g)<1$, representing a degradation. Thus, $g_{\\text{th}}=1$ is the threshold.\n\nThe final answer requires expressing $R(g)$ and $g_{\\text{th}}$ as a single row matrix.\nThe two results are $R(g) = g^{2}$ and $g_{\\text{th}} = 1$.\nThe row matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix} g^{2} & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the posterior variance, denoted as $V(k)$, of a latent state $x$ given a sensory measurement $y$, under an attentional modulation factor $k$. The derivation must start from Bayes' theorem and the definition of the Gaussian probability density function (PDF).\n\nFirst, let's establish the prior and the likelihood distributions.\n\nThe prior distribution of the latent state $x$ is given as a Gaussian:\n$$p(x) = \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{0}, \\sigma_{0}^{2})$$\nThe PDF for this distribution is proportional to:\n$$p(x) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x - \\mu_{0})^{2}}{2\\sigma_{0}^{2}}\\right)$$\n\nThe sensory measurement $y$ is generated by the linear Gaussian observation model $y = x + \\eta$. The measurement noise $\\eta$ is a Gaussian random variable. Under attentional modulation, the noise distribution is given by $\\eta \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_{y}^{2}/k)$. From the observation model, for a given state $x$, the measurement $y$ is distributed as a Gaussian centered at $x$ with variance $\\sigma_{y}^{2}/k$.

We can define the effective measurement precision under attention as $\\tau_{y,k} = 1/(\\sigma_{y}^{2}/k) = k/\\sigma_{y}^{2} = k\\tau_{y}$.\n\nSubstituting these precision terms into the exponent of the posterior distribution:\n$$p(x|y) \\propto \\exp\\left( -\\frac{1}{2} \\left[ k\\tau_{y}(x - y)^{2} + \\tau_{0}(x - \\mu_{0})^{2} \\right] \\right)$$\nThe product of two Gaussian distributions is another Gaussian.

The variance is the reciprocal of the precision:\n$$V(k) = \\sigma_{\\text{post}}^{2}(k) = \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\text{post}}(k)}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\tau_{\\text{post}}(k)$:\n$$V(k) = \\frac{1}{\\tau_{0} + k\\tau_{y}}$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytic expression for the posterior variance $V(k)$ in terms of the prior precision $\\tau_{0}$, the baseline measurement precision $\\tau_{y}$, and the attentional modulation factor $k$.",
