            "introduction": "At the heart of any inferential system, including the brain, lies the fundamental challenge of updating beliefs in light of new evidence. This exercise explores the mathematical bedrock of predictive coding by deriving the solution for an ideal Bayesian observer. By working through this problem, you will see how a new belief (the posterior) is formed by combining a prior belief with sensory data (the likelihood), with each contribution weighted by its respective precision or reliability. This concept of a precision-weighted average is a cornerstone of the predictive coding framework and provides the target that the dynamic process of error minimization seeks to achieve .",

            "problem": "Consider a single-latent-variable generative model commonly used to formalize Predictive Coding and Bayesian brain frameworks in neurobiology. A latent cause $x$ represents the brain’s prediction about a sensory input, and a measurement $y$ is the observed sensory signal. Assume a Gaussian prior on the latent cause, $x \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{0}, \\sigma_{0}^{2})$, and a Gaussian likelihood for the observation given the cause, $y \\mid x \\sim \\mathcal{N}(x, \\sigma_{y}^{2})$, where $\\sigma_{0}^{2} > 0$ and $\\sigma_{y}^{2} > 0$ are known constants. Using Bayes’ rule and the well-tested fact that products of Gaussian densities yield another Gaussian density in the variable of interest, derive the posterior density $p(x \\mid y)$ in closed form and show that it is Gaussian. Then express the posterior mean and posterior variance using precision-weighted combinations of the prior mean and the observation. Define precision as the inverse of variance, so that $\\tau_{0} = 1 / \\sigma_{0}^{2}$ and $\\tau_{y} = 1 / \\sigma_{y}^{2}$. Provide the final expressions for the posterior mean and the posterior variance in terms of $\\mu_{0}$, $y$, $\\tau_{0}$, and $\\tau_{y}$.

It is a well-posed problem in Bayesian statistics, grounded in established mathematical principles and directly applicable to the specified neurobiological framework of predictive coding. All necessary information is provided, and the terms are unambiguous.\n\nThe task is to derive the posterior probability density function (PDF) $p(x \\mid y)$ for a latent cause $x$ given an observation $y$. We are given the prior distribution for $x$ and the likelihood function for $y$ given $x$.\n\nThe prior is a Gaussian distribution:\n$$p(x) = \\mathcal{N}(x \\mid \\mu_{0}, \\sigma_{0}^{2}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma_{0}^{2}}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x - \\mu_{0})^2}{2\\sigma_{0}^{2}}\\right)$$\nThe likelihood is also a Gaussian distribution:\n$$p(y \\mid x) = \\mathcal{N}(y \\mid x, \\sigma_{y}^{2}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma_{y}^{2}}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(y - x)^2}{2\\sigma_{y}^{2}}\\right)$$\nAccording to Bayes' rule, the posterior distribution is proportional to the product of the likelihood and the prior:\n$$p(x \\mid y) \\propto p(y \\mid x) p(x)$$\nSubstituting the given distributions, we have:\n$$p(x \\mid y) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(y - x)^2}{2\\sigma_{y}^{2}}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x - \\mu_{0})^2}{2\\sigma_{0}^{2}}\\right)$$\nWe can combine the arguments of the exponential functions:\n$$p(x \\mid y) \\propto \\exp\\left( -\\frac{(y - x)^2}{2\\sigma_{y}^{2}} - \\frac{(x - \\mu_{0})^2}{2\\sigma_{0}^{2}} \\right)$$\nTo find the form of the posterior, we analyze the exponent, focusing on the terms that depend on $x$. Let $E(x)$ be the argument of the exponential:\n$$E(x) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{(y - x)^2}{\\sigma_{y}^{2}} + \\frac{(x - \\mu_{0})^2}{\\sigma_{0}^{2}} \\right)$$\nExpanding the squared terms:\n$$E(x) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{y^2 - 2yx + x^2}{\\sigma_{y}^{2}} + \\frac{x^2 - 2x\\mu_{0} + \\mu_{0}^2}{\\sigma_{0}^{2}} \\right)$$\nWe now group the terms by powers of $x$:\n$$E(x) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\left[ x^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sigma_{0}^{2}} + \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{y}^{2}}\\right) - 2x \\left(\\frac{\\mu_{0}}{\\sigma_{0}^{2}} + \\frac{y}{\\sigma_{y}^{2}}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{\\mu_{0}^2}{\\sigma_{0}^{2}} + \\frac{y^2}{\\sigma_{y}^{2}}\\right) \\right]$$\nThe problem defines precision as the inverse of variance: $\\tau_{0} = 1/\\sigma_{0}^{2}$ and $\\tau_{y} = 1/\\sigma_{y}^{2}$.

This practice delves into this core mechanism by framing inference as gradient descent on a Variational Free Energy (VFE) landscape, where updates are driven by prediction errors. Here, we extend the model to include a non-linear relationship between the hidden cause and the sensory observation, a crucial step for modeling the complex, hierarchical regularities of the natural world.

We can therefore proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe core of the problem is to compute the gradient of the log joint probability density, $\\nabla_{x} \\ln p(y, x)$, and then use it to perform a one-step update of the latent state estimate $x$. The joint probability $p(y, x)$ is given by the product of the likelihood $p(y|x)$ and the prior $p(x)$, based on the chain rule of probability:\n$$p(y, x) = p(y | x) p(x)$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of this expression, we get:\n$$\\ln p(y, x) = \\ln p(y | x) + \\ln p(x)$$\nWe will now define the explicit forms for the log-likelihood and log-prior.\n\nFirst, we consider the likelihood $p(y|x)$.

Derivation of the Gradient Descent Update Rule**\n\nThe core of the predictive coding process described here is the minimization of the Variational Free Energy, $F(x)$, via gradient descent. The update rule for the latent variable $x$ is given by moving $x$ in the direction opposite to the gradient of $F(x)$. First, we must compute the gradient, $\\dfrac{dF}{dx}$.\n\nThe VFE is the sum of two terms:\n$$\nF(x) = F_{prior}(x) + F_{data}(x) = \\dfrac{\\alpha}{4} \\left( x^2 - m^2 \\right)^2 + \\dfrac{\\lambda}{2} \\left( y - x \\right)^2\n$$\n\nWe differentiate each term with respect to $x$ using the chain rule:\n\nFor the prior energy term, $F_{prior}(x)$:\n$$\n\\dfrac{dF_{prior}}{dx} = \\dfrac{d}{dx} \\left[ \\dfrac{\\alpha}{4} \\left( x^2 - m^2 \\right)^2 \\right] = \\dfrac{\\alpha}{4} \\cdot 2 \\left( x^2 - m^2 \\right) \\cdot \\dfrac{d}{dx}(x^2 - m^2) = \\dfrac{\\alpha}{2} \\left( x^2 - m^2 \\right) (2x) = \\alpha x (x^2 - m^2)\n$$\nThis simplifies to $\\alpha (x^3 - m^2 x)$.\n\nFor the data-fitting energy term, $F_{data}(x)$:\n$$\n\\dfrac{dF_{data}}{dx} = \\dfrac{d}{dx} \\left[ \\dfrac{\\lambda}{2} \\left( y - x \\right)^2 \\right] = \\dfrac{\\lambda}{2} \\cdot 2 \\left( y - x \\right) \\cdot \\dfrac{d}{dx}(y - x) = \\lambda (y - x) (-1) = \\lambda (x - y)\n$$\n\nThe total gradient of the VFE is the sum of these two components:\n$$\n\\dfrac{dF}{dx} = \\alpha (x^3 - m^2 x) + \\lambda(x - y)\n$$\n\nThe gradient descent update rule for $x$ at iteration $k$, with a step size (learning rate) $\\eta_k$, is:\n$$\nx_{k+1} = x_k - \\eta_k \\left. \\dfrac{dF}{dx} \\right|_{x=x_k}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived gradient, we get the explicit update rule:\n$$\nx_{k+1} = x_k - \\eta_k \\left( \\alpha (x_k^3 - m^2 x_k) + \\lambda(x_k - y) \\right)\n$$\n\n**2. Algorithmic Design and Implementation**\n\nThe problem requires a deterministic algorithm to perform this gradient descent until convergence. A non-convex function like $F(x)$ can have multiple local minima, and the standard gradient descent algorithm only guarantees convergence to one of these, depending on the initialization $x_0$. To ensure stable convergence, a backtracking line search is employed to determine the step size $\\eta_k$ at each iteration.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1.  Initialize $x$ with the given starting value $x_0$.\n2.  Begin an iterative loop, up to a maximum of `max_iter` iterations.\n3.  In each iteration $k$, calculate the gradient $g_k = \\left. \\dfrac{dF}{dx} \\right|_{x=x_k}$.\n4.  Check for convergence: if the absolute magnitude of the gradient, $|g_k|$, is less than the tolerance $10^{-10}$, the process has converged to a stationary point. The loop is terminated.\n5.  If not converged, perform a backtracking line search to find an appropriate step size $\\eta_k$.\n    a. Start with the initial step size $\\eta_k = \\eta$. Let the current energy be $F_k = F(x_k)$.\n    b. Propose a new state $x_{prop} = x_k - \\eta_k g_k$.\n    c. If $F(x_{prop})  F_k$, the step size is accepted.\n    d. If $F(x_{prop}) \\geq F_k$, the step size is too large. It is halved ($\\eta_k \\leftarrow \\eta_k / 2$), and step 5b is repeated. This halving is done at most $20$ times.\n    e. If a suitable step size is not found after all allowed halvings, it implies that no further progress can be made from $x_k$. The algorithm is considered converged at $x_k$.\n6.  Update the state using the accepted step size: $x_{k+1} = x_k - \\eta_k g_k$.\n7.  The loop continues until a termination condition (gradient tolerance, max iterations, or failed backtracking) is met. The final value of $x$ is the solution $x^\\star$.\n\n**3. Mode Classification**\n\nAfter convergence to a stable point $x^\\star$, the solution must be classified according to which of the prior's two potential wells it landed in. The wells are centered at $+m$ and $-m$. The classification is based on the Euclidean distance from $x^\\star$ to these two points:\n-   Let $d_+ = |x^\\star - m|$ be the distance to the right well.\n-   Let $d_- = |x^\\star + m|$ be the distance to the left well.\n\nThe mode index is assigned as:\n-   $+1$ if $d_+  d_-$, meaning $x^\\star$ is closer to the right well. This is true for any $x^\\star > 0$.\n-   $-1$ if $d_-  d_+$, meaning $x^\\star$ is closer to the left well. This is true for any $x^\\star  0$.\n-   $0$ if $d_+ = d_-$, meaning $x^\\star$ is equidistant from both wells. This occurs only if $x^\\star = 0$, which is a saddle point (local maximum) of the VFE when $y=0$.\n\nThis procedure correctly partitions the real line into three regions corresponding to the basins of attraction of the two minima and the unstable fixed point between them. The test suite demonstrates how the interplay of the prior ($\\alpha, m$), the data ($\\lambda, y$), and the initialization ($x_0$) determines which of these regions the system converges to. For instance, a strong data term (large $\\lambda$) can pull the system out of the basin suggested by its initialization, whereas a strong prior (large $\\alpha$) will make the system more resilient to conflicting data.",
