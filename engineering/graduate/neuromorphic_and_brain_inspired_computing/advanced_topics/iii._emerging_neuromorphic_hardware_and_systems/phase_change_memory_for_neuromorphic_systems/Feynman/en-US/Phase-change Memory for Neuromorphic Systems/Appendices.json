It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Symbolic Expression**\n\nThe First Law of Thermodynamics for a closed system states that the change in internal energy, $\\Delta U$, is equal to the heat $Q$ added to the system minus the work $W$ done by the system:\n$$ \\Delta U = Q - W $$\nThe problem states to assume negligible mechanical work, so $W = 0$.\n$$ \\Delta U = Q $$\nThe problem also assumes negligible heat loss to the environment. This implies that the minimum energy required to effect the change, $E_{\\min}$, is precisely the heat $Q$ that must be supplied to the system.\n$$ E_{\\min} = Q = \\Delta U $$\nThe total process of heating from $T_0$ and fully melting can be divided into two distinct thermodynamic stages:\n1.  **Sensible Heating ($Q_1$)**: Raising the temperature of the solid material from the initial temperature $T_0$ to its melting temperature $T_m$.\n2.  **Latent Heating ($Q_2$)**: The phase transition from solid to liquid at a constant temperature $T_m$.\n\nThe total energy required is the sum of the energies for each stage:\n$$ E_{\\min} = Q_1 + Q_2 $$\nLet's analyze each stage. The mass $m$ of the material is given by the product of its density $\\rho$ and volume $V$:\n$$ m = \\rho V $$\n\n**Stage 1: Sensible Heating**\nThe energy $Q_1$ required to change the temperature of a mass $m$ by an amount $dT$ is given by $dQ_1 = m c_p dT$, where $c_p$ is the specific heat capacity. Since $c_p$ is assumed to be temperature-independent, we can integrate this expression from the initial temperature $T_0$ to the final temperature $T_m$:\n$$ Q_1 = \\int_{T_0}^{T_m} m c_p dT = m c_p \\int_{T_0}^{T_m} dT = m c_p (T_m - T_0) $$\nSubstituting $m = \\rho V$:\n$$ Q_1 = \\rho V c_p (T_m - T_0) $$\n\n**Stage 2: Latent Heating**\nThe energy $Q_2$ required for the phase change (melting) is determined by the latent heat of fusion, $L$, which is the energy required per unit mass to cause the transition. For a mass $m$, the total energy is:\n$$ Q_2 = m L $$\nSubstituting $m = \\rho V$:\n$$ Q_2 = \\rho V L $$\n\n**Total Minimum Energy**\nThe total minimum energy $E_{\\min}$ is the sum of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$:\n$$ E_{\\min} = Q_1 + Q_2 = \\rho V c_p (T_m - T_0) + \\rho V L $$\nFactoring out the common term $\\rho V$, we arrive at the final symbolic expression:\n$$ E_{\\min} = \\rho V [ c_p (T_m - T_0) + L ] $$\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- $\\rho = 6\\ \\text{g/cm}^3$\n- $c_p = 0.2\\ \\text{J/gK}$\n- $V = 10^{-18}\\ \\text{m}^3$\n- $L = 100\\ \\text{J/g}$\n- $T_m = 900\\ \\text{K}$\n- $T_0 = 300\\ \\text{K}$\n\nThe units are inconsistent.

The voltage is set to zero, so the power input is $P(t) = 0$. The governing equation becomes:\n$$\\frac{d \\Delta T}{dt} + \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\tau_\\text{th}} = 0$$\nThis is a homogeneous ODE with the solution $\\Delta T(t) = B \\exp(-(t-t_\\text{R})/\\tau_\\text{th})$ for $t > t_\\text{R}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is analyzed and found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of heat transfer and solid-state physics, well-posed with all necessary data provided, and objective in its formulation. No flaws related to scientific soundness, completeness, or logical consistency were identified. We can therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the total fractional change in the victim cell's conductance, $\\Delta G / G_{0}$, due to thermal crosstalk from an adjacent aggressor cell. This total change is the sum of a reversible, temperature-induced component and an irreversible, phase-change-induced component.\n\nFirst, we determine the temperature rise, $\\Delta T$, at the center of the victim cell. The problem states to use the quasi-steady temperature rise, which for a point source of constant power in an infinite medium, can be derived from Fourier's law of heat conduction. In steady state, the total power $P_{0}$ flows radially outward through any spherical surface of radius $r$ centered on the source. The heat flux density is $\\vec{j}_q = -k \\nabla T$. For radial symmetry, the magnitude of the flux density is $j_q = -k \\frac{dT}{dr}$. The total heat flow through the spherical surface of area $A=4\\pi r^2$ is $P_0 = j_q A = (-k \\frac{dT}{dr})(4\\pi r^2)$.\nRearranging and integrating gives the temperature profile:\n$$P_{0} = -4 \\pi k r^2 \\frac{dT}{dr} \\implies dT = -\\frac{P_{0}}{4 \\pi k} \\frac{dr}{r^2}$$\nIntegrating from a point at distance $r$ to infinity (where the temperature is the ambient $T_{0}$):\n$$\\int_{T(r)}^{T_{0}} dT' = -\\frac{P_{0}}{4 \\pi k} \\int_{r}^{\\infty} \\frac{dr'}{r'^2}$$\n$$T_{0} - T(r) = -\\frac{P_{0}}{4 \\pi k} \\left[-\\frac{1}{r'}\\right]_{r}^{\\infty} = -\\frac{P_{0}}{4 \\pi k} \\left(0 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{r}\\right)\\right) = -\\frac{P_{0}}{4 \\pi k r}$$\nThe temperature rise $\\Delta T = T(r) - T_{0}$ is therefore:\n$$\\Delta T = \\frac{P_{0}}{4 \\pi k r}$$\nUsing the given values: $P_{0} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{W}$, $k = 1.0\\,\\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$, and $r = 200\\,\\text{nm} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{m}$.\n$$\\Delta T = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{W}}{4 \\pi (1.0\\,\\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}) (2.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{m})} = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{2}}{8.0 \\pi}\\,\\text{K} = \\frac{125}{2\\pi}\\,\\text{K}$$\nNumerically, $\\Delta T \\approx 19.894368\\,\\text{K}$. The temperature at the victim cell during the pulse is $T = T_{0} + \\Delta T = 300\\,\\text{K} + \\frac{125}{2\\pi}\\,\\text{K} \\approx 319.894368\\,\\text{K}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the total fractional change in conductance, $\\frac{\\Delta G}{G_{0}}$. Following the problem description, we can express the total change as the sum of a reversible and an irreversible contribution, which is a first-order approximation: $\\Delta G_{total} \\approx \\Delta G_{rev} + \\Delta G_{irrev}$. The fractional change is then:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta G}{G_{0}} = \\frac{\\Delta G_{rev}}{G_{0}} + \\frac{\\Delta G_{irrev}}{G_{0}}$$\n\nThe reversible part is due to the temperature coefficient of conductance, $\\gamma$. At fixed fraction $f_{0}$, the change is $\\Delta G_{rev} = G_{0} \\gamma \\Delta T$. The fractional change is:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta G_{rev}}{G_{0}} = \\gamma \\Delta T = (3.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}) \\left(\\frac{125}{2\\pi}\\,\\text{K}\\right) = \\frac{0.375}{2\\pi}$$\nNumerically, this is $\\approx 0.059683$.\n\nThe irreversible part is due to the change in crystalline fraction, $\\Delta f = f_{final} - f_{0}$. The change in fraction is governed by the first-order kinetic equation: $\\frac{df}{dt} = K(T) (1 - f)$, where $K(T) = k_{0} \\exp(-\\frac{E_{a}}{k_{B} T})$.\nSince the temperature $T$ is assumed constant during the pulse of duration $\\tau$, we can integrate this equation:\n$$\\int_{f_{0}}^{f_{final}} \\frac{df}{1-f} = \\int_{0}^{\\tau} K(T) dt \\implies [-\\ln(1-f)]_{f_{0}}^{f_{final}} = K(T) \\tau$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{1-f_{0}}{1-f_{final}}\\right) = K(T) \\tau \\implies f_{final} = 1 - (1-f_{0})\\exp(-K(T)\\tau)$$\nThe change in fraction is $\\Delta f = f_{final} - f_0 = (1 - (1-f_{0})\\exp(-K(T)\\tau)) - f_0 = (1-f_0)(1 - \\exp(-K(T)\\tau))$.\nWe must first calculate the rate constant $K(T)$ at $T \\approx 319.894368\\,\\text{K}$. Given $E_a = 2.0\\,\\text{eV}$ and $k_B=8.617 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{eV}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$:\n$$ \\frac{E_{a}}{k_{B} T} = \\frac{2.0\\,\\text{eV}}{(8.617 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{eV}\\,\\text{K}^{-1})(319.894368\\,\\text{K})} \\approx 72.563 $$\n$$ K(T) = k_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{a}}{k_{B} T}\\right) = (1.0 \\times 10^{13}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}) \\exp(-72.563) \\approx 5.106 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{s}^{-1} $$\nWith pulse duration $\\tau = 50\\,\\text{ns} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\text{s}$, the term $K(T)\\tau$ is:\n$$ K(T)\\tau \\approx (5.106 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}) (5.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\text{s}) \\approx 2.553 \\times 10^{-26} $$\nThis value is extremely small. We can approximate $\\exp(-x) \\approx 1 - x$ for small $x$.\n$$\\Delta f = (1-f_{0})(1 - (1 - K(T)\\tau)) = (1-f_{0})K(T)\\tau$$\nWith $f_{0}=0.05$, we get $\\Delta f = (0.95)(2.553 \\times 10^{-26}) \\approx 2.425 \\times 10^{-26}$.\nThe change in fraction is negligible.\n\nThe conductance change due to the change in fraction is $\\Delta G_{irrev} = G(f_{final}) - G(f_0) = (G_{\\text{c}} - G_{\\text{a}})\\Delta f$.\nThe fractional irreversible change is $\\frac{\\Delta G_{irrev}}{G_{0}} = \\frac{G_{\\text{c}} - G_{\\text{a}}}{G_{0}}\\Delta f$.\nFirst, calculate the initial conductance $G_0$:\n$$G_{\\text{a}} = 20\\,\\mu\\text{S} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{S}$$\n$$G_{\\text{c}} = 2.0\\,\\text{mS} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{S}$$\n$$G_{0} = G_{\\text{a}}(1-f_{0}) + G_{\\text{c}}f_{0} = (2.0 \\times 10^{-5})(1-0.05) + (2.0 \\times 10^{-3})(0.05)$$\n$$G_{0} = (2.0 \\times 10^{-5})(0.95) + 1.0 \\times 10^{-4} = 1.9 \\times 10^{-5} + 1.0 \\times 10^{-4} = 1.19 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{S}$$\nThe prefactor for the irreversible term is:\n$$\\frac{G_{\\text{c}} - G_{\\text{a}}}{G_{0}} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-3} - 2.0 \\times 10^{-5}}{1.19 \\times 10^{-4}} = \\frac{1.98 \\times 10^{-3}}{1.19 \\times 10^{-4}} \\approx 16.64$$\nThe irreversible fractional change is then $(16.64) \\times (2.425 \\times 10^{-26})$, which is on the order of $10^{-25}$. This is insignificant compared to the reversible change.\n\nThe total fractional change is dominated entirely by the reversible component:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta G}{G_{0}} = \\frac{\\Delta G_{rev}}{G_{0}} + \\frac{\\Delta G_{irrev}}{G_{0}} \\approx \\gamma \\Delta T + 0 = \\frac{0.375}{2\\pi} \\approx 0.0596831$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $0.05968$.",
