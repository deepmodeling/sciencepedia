The memristor stack thickness is approximated as a uniform active medium of length $L$ that hosts a single cylindrical conduction path of radius $r$. In the low-resistance state, a metallic filament spans the device and can be modeled as a homogeneous conductor with conductivity $\\sigma_{\\text{fil}}$ filling the cylindrical path.

            "solution": "The first step is to derive the functional dependence of conductance $G$ on conductivity $\\sigma$, cross-sectional area $A$, and length $L$ for a uniform cylindrical conductor, starting from the given fundamental relations.\n\nThe problem provides the constitutive relation in its point form, Ohm's law, which connects current density $\\mathbf{J}$ to the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ via the material's conductivity $\\sigma$:\n$$ \\mathbf{J} = \\sigma \\mathbf{E} $$\nWe are given the assumption of a uniform electric field along the length $L$ of the conductor, resulting from a potential difference $V$ applied across it. The magnitude of this field is given as:\n$$ |\\mathbf{E}| = \\frac{V}{L} $$\nSince the conductor is uniform, the electric field and current density vectors will be directed along the axis of the cylinder. We can align our coordinate system such that this is the $z$-axis. Thus, $\\mathbf{E} = E_z \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ and $\\mathbf{J} = J_z \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, where $E_z = V/L$. The magnitude of the current density is then:\n$$ J_z = \\sigma E_z = \\sigma \\frac{V}{L} $$\nThe problem states that the current density is uniform across the conduction path. The total current $I$ flowing through the conductor is the integral of the current density over the cross-sectional area $A$:\n$$ I = \\iint_A \\mathbf{J} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A} $$\nThe area element $d\\mathbf{A}$ is a vector perpendicular to the cross-sectional surface, so $d\\mathbf{A} = dA \\, \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. The dot product is $\\mathbf{J} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A} = J_z dA$. Since $J_z$ is uniform over the area $A$, the integral simplifies to:\n$$ I = J_z \\iint_A dA = J_z A $$\nSubstituting the expression for $J_z$:\n$$ I = \\left(\\sigma \\frac{V}{L}\\right) A $$\nBy definition, conductance $G$ is the ratio of the current $I$ to the voltage $V$:\n$$ G = \\frac{I}{V} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $I$, we obtain the general expression for the conductance of a uniform conductor:\n$$ G = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma A}{L}\\right) V}{V} = \\frac{\\sigma A}{L} $$\nThis expression confirms the expected dependence: conductance is directly proportional to conductivity and cross-sectional area, and inversely proportional to length.\n\nThe second step is to apply this general formula to find the on-state conductance $G_{\\text{on}}$ and the off-state conductance $G_{\\text{off}}$. The conduction path is a cylinder of radius $r$, so its cross-sectional area is $A = \\pi r^2$.\n\nIn the on-state, or low-resistance state (LRS), the conduction path is a metallic filament with conductivity $\\sigma_{\\text{fil}}$. The conductance is therefore:\n$$ G_{\\text{on}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{fil}} A}{L} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{fil}} \\pi r^2}{L} $$\nIn the off-state, or high-resistance state (HRS), transport is dominated by a region with effective conductivity $\\sigma_{\\text{gap}}$ over the same geometric path. The conductance is:\n$$ G_{\\text{off}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{gap}} A}{L} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{gap}} \\pi r^2}{L} $$\n\nThe third step is to determine the on/off conductance ratio, $G_{\\text{on}}/G_{\\text{off}}$. This is found by dividing the expression for $G_{\\text{on}}$ by the expression for $G_{\\text{off}}$:\n$$ \\frac{G_{\\text{on}}}{G_{\\text{off}}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{fil}} \\pi r^2}{L}}{\\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{gap}} \\pi r^2}{L}} $$\nThe geometric factors $A = \\pi r^2$ and $L$ are identical for both states and therefore cancel out. The ratio simplifies to the ratio of the conductivities:\n$$ \\frac{G_{\\text{on}}}{G_{\\text{off}}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{fil}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{gap}}} $$\nThis shows that for the given model, the on/off ratio is independent of the filament's specific geometry ($r$ and $L$), provided the geometry is the same for both states.\n\nFinally, we evaluate this ratio numerically using the provided parameter values:\n- $\\sigma_{\\text{fil}} = 3.5 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{S}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$\n- $\\sigma_{\\text{gap}} = 1.4 \\times 10^{-2} \\, \\text{S}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$\nThe values for radius $r$ and length $L$ are not needed for the final ratio calculation.\n\n$$ \\frac{G_{\\text{on}}}{G_{\\text{off}}} = \\frac{3.5 \\times 10^6}{1.4 \\times 10^{-2}} = \\left(\\frac{3.5}{1.4}\\right) \\times 10^{(6 - (-2))} = 2.5 \\times 10^8 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The exact result of the calculation is $2.5 \\times 10^8$. Expressing this with three significant figures gives $2.50 \\times 10^8$.",

            "problem": "Consider a single row in a hybrid Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS)-memristor crossbar operating in read mode. The row interconnect is modeled as a distributed Resistive-Capacitive (RC) line discretized into $N$ uniform segments. Each segment has series resistance $r$ and shunt capacitance $c$ to ground, so that the total line resistance is $R_{\\text{line}} = N r$. At the node of segment $j$ (counted from the driver as $j=1,2,\\dots,N$), a memristive cell connects to its column through a small-signal conductance $G_{ij}$; the columns are held at virtual ground by a Transimpedance Amplifier (TIA), which may be treated, for small-signal analysis, as an ideal ground at the column side.\n\nAn ideal voltage source applies a direct-current (DC) input $V_i$ to the row at node $0$ (the driver end). Assume the quasi-static regime and that capacitances do not contribute to steady-state DC attenuation. Using Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL) and Ohm’s law as the only starting principles, derive a closed-form first-order approximation for the steady-state voltage $v_{iN}$ at the last row node ($j=N$) in terms of $V_i$, $R_{\\text{line}}$, $N$, and the set $\\{G_{ij}\\}_{j=1}^{N}$, in the limit that the dimensionless loading parameter $R_{\\text{line}} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} G_{ij}$ is small enough that all second and higher powers of it can be neglected.\n\nExpress your final answer for $v_{iN}$ in volts. No numerical values are provided; your answer must be a single closed-form analytic expression. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "We are asked to find the steady-state DC voltage $v_{iN}$ at the $N$-th node of a resistive line.\nIn the DC steady-state, all time derivatives are zero, and thus capacitors act as open circuits. Therefore, the shunt capacitances $c$ do not draw any current and can be removed from the circuit model for this DC analysis. The row interconnect is a purely resistive ladder network.\n\nThe model consists of $N$ series resistors, each with resistance $r$. Let $v_{ij}$ be the voltage at node $j$ of row $i$, where $j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N\\}$. The input voltage is $v_{i0} = V_i$.

Let $I_k$ be the current flowing through the series resistor between node $k-1$ and node $k$. According to Ohm's law, the voltage drop across this resistor is $r I_k$. The current $I_k$ must be equal to the sum of all currents drawn by the conductances at nodes $k, k+1, \\dots, N$, since these are the only paths to ground downstream from that resistor.\n\nThe current sunk by the conductance $G_{im}$ at node $m$ is $I_{G_{im}} = G_{im} v_{im}$.\nTherefore, the current $I_k$ through the $k$-th resistor (between node $k-1$ and $k$) is:\n$$I_k = \\sum_{m=k}^{N} I_{G_{im}} = \\sum_{m=k}^{N} G_{im} v_{im}$$\n\nThe voltage at the final node, $v_{iN}$, is the source voltage $V_i$ minus the sum of the voltage drops across all $N$ series resistors:\n$$v_{iN} = v_{i0} - \\sum_{k=1}^{N} (v_{i,k-1} - v_{ik}) = V_i - \\sum_{k=1}^{N} r I_k$$\nSubstituting the expression for $I_k$:\n$$v_{iN} = V_i - \\sum_{k=1}^{N} r \\left( \\sum_{m=k}^{N} G_{im} v_{im} \\right)$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$v_{iN} = V_i - r \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\sum_{m=k}^{N} G_{im} v_{im}$$\nThis is an exact expression for $v_{iN}$. To solve it, we would need to solve the system of linear equations for all $v_{im}$. However, the problem asks for a first-order approximation in the limit of a small loading parameter, which is proportional to $r$ and $G_{ij}$.\n\nIn this limit, the voltage drops along the line are small. We can construct a perturbative solution.\nThe zeroth-order approximation is to assume the loading is zero ($r=0$ or all $G_{ij}=0$). In this case, there is no voltage drop along the line.\n$$v_{ij}^{(0)} = V_i \\quad \\text{for all } j \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$$\nTo find the first-order approximation for $v_{iN}$, we substitute the zeroth-order approximation for the voltages $v_{im}$ into the right-hand side of the exact equation.
