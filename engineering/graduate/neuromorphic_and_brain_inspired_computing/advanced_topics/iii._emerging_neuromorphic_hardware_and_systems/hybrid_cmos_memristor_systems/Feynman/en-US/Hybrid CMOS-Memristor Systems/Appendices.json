The memristor stack thickness is approximated as a uniform active medium of length $L$ that hosts a single cylindrical conduction path of radius $r$. In the low-resistance state, a metallic filament spans the device and can be modeled as a homogeneous conductor with conductivity $\\sigma_{\\text{fil}}$ filling the cylindrical path. In the high-resistance state, the filament is ruptured at the atomic scale, but leakage is dominated by transport across the same cylindrical path through a uniformly resistive gap with effective conductivity $\\sigma_{\\text{gap}}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of electromagnetism and condensed matter physics, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and objective in its language. The model of a memristive filament is a standard simplification used in the field.\n\nThe first step is to derive the functional dependence of conductance $G$ on conductivity $\\sigma$, cross-sectional area $A$, and length $L$ for a uniform cylindrical conductor, starting from the given fundamental relations.\n\nThe problem provides the constitutive relation in its point form, Ohm's law, which connects current density $\\mathbf{J}$ to the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ via the material's conductivity $\\sigma$:\n$$ \\mathbf{J} = \\sigma \\mathbf{E} $$\nWe are given the assumption of a uniform electric field along the length $L$ of the conductor, resulting from a potential difference $V$ applied across it. The magnitude of this field is given as:\n$$ |\\mathbf{E}| = \\frac{V}{L} $$\nSince the conductor is uniform, the electric field and current density vectors will be directed along the axis of the cylinder. We can align our coordinate system such that this is the $z$-axis. Thus, $\\mathbf{E} = E_z \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ and $\\mathbf{J} = J_z \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, where $E_z = V/L$. The magnitude of the current density is then:\n$$ J_z = \\sigma E_z = \\sigma \\frac{V}{L} $$\nThe problem states that the current density is uniform across the conduction path. The total current $I$ flowing through the conductor is the integral of the current density over the cross-sectional area $A$:\n$$ I = \\iint_A \\mathbf{J} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A} $$\nThe area element $d\\mathbf{A}$ is a vector perpendicular to the cross-sectional surface, so $d\\mathbf{A} = dA \\, \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. The dot product is $\\mathbf{J} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A} = J_z dA$. Since $J_z$ is uniform over the area $A$, the integral simplifies to:\n$$ I = J_z \\iint_A dA = J_z A $$\nSubstituting the expression for $J_z$:\n$$ I = \\left(\\sigma \\frac{V}{L}\\right) A $$\nBy definition, conductance $G$ is the ratio of the current $I$ to the voltage $V$:\n$$ G = \\frac{I}{V} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $I$, we obtain the general expression for the conductance of a uniform conductor:\n$$ G = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma A}{L}\\right) V}{V} = \\frac{\\sigma A}{L} $$\nThis expression confirms the expected dependence: conductance is directly proportional to conductivity and cross-sectional area, and inversely proportional to length.\n\nThe second step is to apply this general formula to find the on-state conductance $G_{\\text{on}}$ and the off-state conductance $G_{\\text{off}}$. The conduction path is a cylinder of radius $r$, so its cross-sectional area is $A = \\pi r^2$.\n\nIn the on-state, or low-resistance state (LRS), the conduction path is a metallic filament with conductivity $\\sigma_{\\text{fil}}$. The conductance is therefore:\n$$ G_{\\text{on}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{fil}} A}{L} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{fil}} \\pi r^2}{L} $$\nIn the off-state, or high-resistance state (HRS), transport is dominated by a region with effective conductivity $\\sigma_{\\text{gap}}$ over the same geometric path. The conductance is:\n$$ G_{\\text{off}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{gap}} A}{L} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{gap}} \\pi r^2}{L} $$\n\nThe third step is to determine the on/off conductance ratio, $G_{\\text{on}}/G_{\\text{off}}$. This is found by dividing the expression for $G_{\\text{on}}$ by the expression for $G_{\\text{off}}$:\n$$ \\frac{G_{\\text{on}}}{G_{\\text{off}}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{fil}} \\pi r^2}{L}}{\\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{gap}} \\pi r^2}{L}} $$\nThe geometric factors $A = \\pi r^2$ and $L$ are identical for both states and therefore cancel out. The ratio simplifies to the ratio of the conductivities:\n$$ \\frac{G_{\\text{on}}}{G_{\\text{off}}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{fil}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{gap}}} $$\nThis shows that for the given model, the on/off ratio is independent of the filament's specific geometry ($r$ and $L$), provided the geometry is the same for both states.\n\nFinally, we evaluate this ratio numerically using the provided parameter values:\n- $\\sigma_{\\text{fil}} = 3.5 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{S}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$\n- $\\sigma_{\\text{gap}} = 1.4 \\times 10^{-2} \\, \\text{S}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$\nThe values for radius $r$ and length $L$ are not needed for the final ratio calculation.\n\n$$ \\frac{G_{\\text{on}}}{G_{\\text{off}}} = \\frac{3.5 \\times 10^6}{1.4 \\times 10^{-2}} = \\left(\\frac{3.5}{1.4}\\right) \\times 10^{(6 - (-2))} = 2.5 \\times 10^8 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

Thermal Noise Power: $\\mathbb{E}[i_{th}^2]$**\n\nThe thermal noise is specified as Johnson–Nyquist noise. For a passive conductive element with conductance $G$ at absolute temperature $T$, the mean-square thermal noise current integrated over an effective one-sided bandwidth $B$ is given by the well-established formula:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[i_{th}^2] = 4 k_B T G B\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. This arises from integrating the white noise power spectral density of the current, $S_i(f) = 4k_B T G$, over the bandwidth $B$.\n\n**b. Random Telegraph Noise (RTN) Power: $\\mathbb{E}[i_{rtn}^2]$**\n\nThe problem provides that $\\Delta I$ is the root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude of the RTN current fluctuation within the measurement bandwidth $B$. For any random variable $x$, its RMS value is defined as $\\sqrt{\\mathbb{E}[x^2]}$. Since the RTN current $i_{rtn}$ is a zero-mean process, its RMS value is also its standard deviation.\nBy definition:\n$$\n\\Delta I = \\sqrt{\\mathbb{E}[i_{rtn}^2]}\n$$\nSquaring both sides gives the mean-square value, or power, of the RTN current:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[i_{rtn}^2] = (\\Delta I)^2\n$$\n\n**3. Final SNR Expression**\n\nWe can now substitute the expressions for the signal power and the total noise power back into the SNR definition.\nThe signal power is $\\mathbb{E}[I_s^2] = G^2 V_r^2$.\nThe total noise power is $\\mathbb{E}[i_n^2] = \\mathbb{E}[i_{th}^2] + \\mathbb{E}[i_{rtn}^2] = 4 k_B T G B + (\\Delta I)^2$.\n\nTherefore, the final expression for the signal-to-noise ratio is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{SNR} = \\frac{G^2 V_r^2}{4 k_B T G B + (\\Delta I)^2}\n$$\nThis expression is a closed-form solution in terms of the given parameters $G$, $V_r$, $B$, $\\Delta I$, $k_B$, and $T$.",
