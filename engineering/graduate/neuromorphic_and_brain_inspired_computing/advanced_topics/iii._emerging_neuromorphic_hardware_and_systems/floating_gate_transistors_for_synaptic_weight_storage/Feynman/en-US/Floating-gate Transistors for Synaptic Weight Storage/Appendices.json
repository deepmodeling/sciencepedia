            "problem": "A capacitive floating-gate synapse implemented with a floating-gate metal-oxide-semiconductor transistor has a floating conductor (the floating gate) that is electrostatically coupled to three input terminals through linear capacitors of values $C_1$, $C_2$, and $C_3$, respectively. The floating gate holds a fixed trapped charge $Q_{\\mathrm{fg}}$ established by prior programming. Assume there are no other significant parasitic or substrate capacitances connected to the floating gate, and that the system is in steady state so that all currents are zero. Use only the linear capacitor relation $q = C \\,\\Delta V$ and charge conservation on the floating conductor to obtain an expression for the floating-gate potential $V_{\\mathrm{fg}}$ in terms of the input node potentials $V_1$, $V_2$, $V_3$, the capacitances $C_1$, $C_2$, $C_3$, and the trapped charge $Q_{\\mathrm{fg}}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the floating-gate potential for a capacitively-coupled multiple-input floating-gate transistor, the subsequent derivation of the input coupling ratios, and the calculation of these ratios for a specific set of capacitance values. The solution proceeds by applying the principle of charge conservation to the floating gate, which is an electrically isolated conductor.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement.\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- A floating-gate transistor with three input terminals coupled through linear capacitors $C_1$, $C_2$, and $C_3$.\n- The floating gate holds a fixed trapped charge $Q_{\\mathrm{fg}}$.\n- Assumptions: No other significant parasitic or substrate capacitances; the system is in steady state (zero current).\n- Physical laws to use: Linear capacitor relation $q = C \\,\\Delta V$ and charge conservation.\n- Objective 1: Derive an expression for the floating-gate potential $V_{\\mathrm{fg}}$ in terms of $V_1$, $V_2$, $V_3$, $C_1$, $C_2$, $C_3$, and $Q_{\\mathrm{fg}}$.\n- Definition: Coupling ratio for input $i$ is $k_i$ and sensitivity is $s_i$, both defined as $\\left.\\frac{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{fg}}}{\\partial V_i}\\right|_{Q_{\\mathrm{fg}}}$.\n- Objective 2: Derive a general expression for the coupling ratio/sensitivity.\n- Numerical values for calculation: $C_1 = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{fF}$, $C_2 = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{fF}$, $C_3 = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{fF}$.\n- Objective 3: Compute the numerical values of the three coupling ratios $k_i$ and the three sensitivities $s_i$.\n- Final formatting: Report results as a six-component row vector $(k_1, k_2, k_3, s_1, s_2, s_3)$, rounded to three significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, using the standard and fundamental model of a floating-gate device based on electrostatic principles. The problem is well-posed, providing a complete set of variables, constants, and assumptions leading to a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The phrasing \"compute the numerical values of the three coupling ratios and the three sensitivities\" is redundant, as the problem statement explicitly defines them as the same quantity. This redundancy does not create a contradiction or invalidate the problem; it merely asks for the same set of three values to be listed twice. The given capacitance values are physically realistic for integrated circuit technology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe floating gate is an isolated conductor. The total charge on this conductor is the fixed, trapped charge $Q_{\\mathrm{fg}}$. This total charge is distributed across the surfaces of the conductor, which in this model form the plates of the three capacitors $C_1$, $C_2$, and $C_3$. Applying the principle of charge conservation, the sum of the charges on these capacitor plates must equal the total charge on the floating gate.\n\nLet $V_{\\mathrm{fg}}$ be the potential of the floating gate, and let $V_1$, $V_2$, and $V_3$ be the potentials at the three input nodes. The charge stored on the floating-gate side of capacitor $C_i$ is given by $q_i = C_i (V_{\\mathrm{fg}} - V_i)$. The charge conservation equation for the floating gate is therefore:\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{fg}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} q_i = C_1 (V_{\\mathrm{fg}} - V_1) + C_2 (V_{\\mathrm{fg}} - V_2) + C_3 (V_{\\mathrm{fg}} - V_3)$$\n\nTo find the expression for $V_{\\mathrm{fg}}$, we rearrange this equation by grouping terms containing $V_{\\mathrm{fg}}$:\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{fg}} = V_{\\mathrm{fg}} C_1 - V_1 C_1 + V_{\\mathrm{fg}} C_2 - V_2 C_2 + V_{\\mathrm{fg}} C_3 - V_3 C_3$$\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{fg}} + V_1 C_1 + V_2 C_2 + V_3 C_3 = V_{\\mathrm{fg}} (C_1 + C_2 + C_3)$$\n\nLet us define the total capacitance connected to the floating gate, $C_T$, as:\n$$C_T = C_1 + C_2 + C_3$$\nSubstituting $C_T$ into the equation, we can solve for $V_{\\mathrm{fg}}$:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{fg}} = \\frac{C_1 V_1 + C_2 V_2 + C_3 V_3 + Q_{\\mathrm{fg}}}{C_T}$$\nThis can also be written as a weighted sum of the input voltages plus an offset term from the trapped charge:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{fg}} = \\frac{C_1}{C_T} V_1 + \\frac{C_2}{C_T} V_2 + \\frac{C_3}{C_T} V_3 + \\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{fg}}}{C_T}$$\nThis is the expression for the floating-gate potential and completes the first objective.\n\nNext, we derive the general expression for the coupling ratio, $k_i$, and the sensitivity, $s_i$. The problem defines both quantities as the partial derivative of the floating-gate potential with respect to an input potential, holding the trapped charge constant: $k_i = s_i = \\left.\\frac{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{fg}}}{\\partial V_i}\\right|_{Q_{\\mathrm{fg}}}$.\nWe compute this partial derivative for a general input $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$:\n$$k_i = s_i = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_i} \\left( \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{3} C_j V_j + Q_{\\mathrm{fg}}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{3} C_j} \\right)$$\nSince the capacitances $C_j$, the trapped charge $Q_{\\mathrm{fg}}$, and the other input voltages $V_j$ (for $j \\neq i$) are held constant during the differentiation with respect to $V_i$, the result is:\n$$k_i = s_i = \\frac{C_i}{\\sum_{j=1}^{3} C_j} = \\frac{C_i}{C_T}$$\nThis is the general expression for the coupling ratio and sensitivity for input $i$. It represents the fractional contribution of capacitor $C_i$ to the total capacitance $C_T$.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical values for the given device parameters: $C_1 = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{fF}$, $C_2 = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{fF}$, and $C_3 = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{fF}$. First, we calculate the total capacitance $C_T$:\n$$C_T = C_1 + C_2 + C_3 = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{fF} + 0.5\\,\\mathrm{fF} + 0.2\\,\\mathrm{fF} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{fF}$$\nNow we compute the individual coupling ratios, which are dimensionless as they are ratios of capacitances.\n\nFor input $1$:\n$$k_1 = s_1 = \\frac{C_1}{C_T} = \\frac{0.3\\,\\mathrm{fF}}{1.0\\,\\mathrm{fF}} = 0.3$$\nFor input $2$:\n$$k_2 = s_2 = \\frac{C_2}{C_T} = \\frac{0.5\\,\\mathrm{fF}}{1.0\\,\\mathrm{fF}} = 0.5$$\nFor input $3$:\n$$k_3 = s_3 = \\frac{C_3}{C_T} = \\frac{0.2\\,\\mathrm{fF}}{1.0\\,\\mathrm{fF}} = 0.2$$\nThe problem requires these values to be reported to three significant figures.\n$k_1 = s_1 = 0.300$\n$k_2 = s_2 = 0.500$\n$k_3 = s_3 = 0.200$\n\nThe final answer is to be presented in a six-component row vector $(k_1, k_2, k_3, s_1, s_2, s_3)$.\nThe vector is $(0.300, 0.500, 0.200, 0.300, 0.500, 0.200)$.",
