Replacing the specific coordinate $x_{d}$ with the general coordinate $x$, and using fractional exponents ($2.5 = 5/2$, $1.5=3/2$, $0.5=1/2$):\n$$\nN_{D}(x) = \\frac{5 C_{0}^{\\frac{5}{2}} V_{bi}}{2 q \\varepsilon^{\\frac{3}{2}}} x^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n$$\nThis is the donor density profile that produces the specified capacitance-voltage relationship.\n\nNext, we derive the fabrication-relevant constraints. The designed doping profile is implemented in a graded epitaxial layer of thickness $T$ with a maximum allowable donor concentration $N_{\\max}$. The specified $C(V)$ characteristic is valid only for the reverse bias range $0 \\leq V \\leq V_{\\max}$.\n\nConstraint 1: The depletion width must not exceed the epitaxial layer thickness.\nThe profile is only physically present for $x \\le T$. The model is valid as long as the depletion region is contained within this layer. The maximum depletion width $x_{d, \\max}$ occurs at the maximum reverse bias $V_{\\max}$, where the total junction voltage is $V_{J, \\max} = V_{bi} + V_{\\max}$.\n$$\nx_{d, \\max} = x_{d}(V_{J, \\max}) = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{C_{0}}\\left(\\frac{V_{bi}+V_{\\max}}{V_{bi}}\\right)^{0.4} = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{C_{0}}\\left(1+\\frac{V_{\\max}}{V_{bi}}\\right)^{0.4}\n$$\nThe constraint is $x_{d, \\max} \\leq T$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\varepsilon}{C_{0}}\\left(1+\\frac{V_{\\max}}{V_{bi}}\\right)^{0.4} \\leq T\n$$\n\nConstraint 2: The required donor concentration must not exceed the maximum allowable concentration.\nThe derived doping profile $N_{D}(x)$ is an increasing function of $x$. The maximum required concentration occurs at the maximum necessary depth, which is $x_{d, \\max}$.\n$$\nN_{D, \\text{peak}} = N_{D}(x_{d, \\max}) = \\left(\\frac{5 C_{0}^{\\frac{5}{2}} V_{bi}}{2 q \\varepsilon^{\\frac{3}{2}}}\\right) (x_{d, \\max})^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n$$\nThis peak concentration must be less than or equal to $N_{\\max}$.\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{5 C_{0}^{\\frac{5}{2}} V_{bi}}{2 q \\varepsilon^{\\frac{3}{2}}}\\right) \\left[\\frac{\\varepsilon}{C_{0}}\\left(1+\\frac{V_{\\max}}{V_{bi}}\\right)^{0.4}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\leq N_{\\max}\n$$\nSimplifying this expression:\n$$\n\\frac{5 C_{0}^{\\frac{5}{2}} V_{bi}}{2 q \\varepsilon^{\\frac{3}{2}}} \\cdot \\frac{\\varepsilon^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{C_{0}^{\\frac{1}{2}}} \\left(1+\\frac{V_{\\max}}{V_{bi}}\\right)^{0.2} \\leq N_{\\max}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{5 C_{0}^{2} V_{bi}}{2 q \\varepsilon} \\left(1+\\frac{V_{\\max}}{V_{bi}}\\right)^{0.2} \\leq N_{\\max}\n$$\nThese two inequalities represent the constraints on the device parameters ($C_0, V_{bi}$) imposed by the fabrication limits ($T, N_{\\max}$) and the desired operating range ($V_{\\max}$).\nThe problem asks for the single expression for $N_D(x)$ as the final answer.",
