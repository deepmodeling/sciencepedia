Under the influence of an electric field, $E$, these components are given by:\n$$J_n = q n \\mu_n E$$\n$$J_p = q p \\mu_p E$$\nwhere $q$ is the elementary charge, $n$ and $p$ are the total electron and hole concentrations, and $\\mu_n$ and $\\mu_p$ are the electron and hole mobilities, respectively.\n\nThe total drift current density is therefore:\n$$J = J_n + J_p = q n \\mu_n E + q p \\mu_p E$$\nBy factoring out the electric field, $E$, we obtain:\n$$J = (q n \\mu_n + q p \\mu_p) E$$\nThe conductivity, $\\sigma$, is defined as the proportionality coefficient linking the total current density and the electric field in a homogeneous medium, according to the point form of Ohm's law, $J = \\sigma E$.

This is a very safe assumption in wide-bandgap semiconductors like SiC, where the intrinsic carrier concentration, $n_i$, is extremely low at typical operating temperatures.

            "solution": "The problem is divided into two parts. The first part requires a critical justification for the failure of the depletion approximation in the intrinsic region of a $p$–$i$–$n$ diode under high-level injection. The second part requires the derivation of the ambipolar transport equation and the expression for the effective ambipolar diffusion coefficient, $D_a$. Both parts will be addressed sequentially, starting from the provided fundamental equations.\n\nPart 1: Justification for the breakdown of the depletion approximation.\n\nThe depletion approximation is a model used to analyze the space-charge region (or depletion region) of a semiconductor junction. Its core assumption is that the space-charge density, $\\rho(x)$, is dominated by the net concentration of fixed, ionized dopant atoms. The contribution from mobile charge carriers (electrons and holes) is assumed to be negligible. Mathematically, this is expressed by simplifying Poisson’s equation,\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dx} = \\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{q}{\\varepsilon}\\left(p - n + N_{D}^{+} - N_{A}^{-}\\right)\n$$\nto\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dx} \\approx \\frac{q}{\\varepsilon}\\left(N_{D}^{+} - N_{A}^{-}\\right)\n$$\nThis approximation is valid in regions that are depleted of mobile carriers, such as the space-charge region of a reverse-biased or zero-biased $p$-$n$ junction, where the strong electric field sweeps mobile electrons and holes out of the region.\n\nHowever, the problem considers the intrinsic base region of a $p$–$i$–$n$ diode under steady forward conduction and high-level injection. The conditions in this region are:\n1.  High-level injection: The injected excess electron and hole concentrations, $n(x)$ and $p(x)$, are much larger than the background doping concentrations, $N_D$ and $N_A$. That is, $n(x), p(x) \\gg N_{A}, N_{D}$.\n2.  The region is the 'intrinsic' base, meaning it is very lightly doped, so $N_D$ and $N_A$ are small to begin with, often close to the intrinsic carrier concentration $n_i$.\n3.  The device is in forward conduction, meaning charge is actively being injected into and transported across this region.\n\nThe breakdown of the depletion approximation can be justified as follows:\n\nFirst, the physical premise of the approximation is directly contradicted. The approximation is named for a region *depleted* of mobile carriers. The intrinsic base under high-level injection is, by contrast, *flooded* with mobile carriers. The concentrations $n(x)$ and $p(x)$ are the dominant charged species present, orders of magnitude greater than the fixed dopant concentrations. To neglect the contribution of the dominant charged species to the net space charge is a-priori invalid.\n\nSecond, we can perform a scaling analysis as requested. The depletion approximation is valid only if the net mobile charge density is negligible compared to the net fixed charge density, i.e., $q|p(x) - n(x)| \\ll q|N_{D}^{+} - N_{A}^{-}|$.\nIn the intrinsic region, the net doping $|N_{D}^{+} - N_{A}^{-}|$ is, by design, very small. Under high-level injection, the condition of quasi-neutrality, $n(x) \\approx p(x)$, holds. This means that $p(x)-n(x)$ is a small difference between two large numbers. However, this difference is not necessarily zero, nor is it negligible in comparison to the extremely small value of $|N_{D}^{+} - N_{A}^{-}|$. In fact, it is this small net mobile charge, $q(p(x)-n(x))$, that gives rise to the space charge in the quasi-neutral region, which in turn creates the electric field $E(x)$ necessary to support the drift component of the current. Since a current is flowing, a non-zero, and generally non-uniform, electric field must exist. According to Poisson's equation, a non-uniform field ($dE/dx \\neq 0$) requires a non-zero space charge $\\rho(x)$. Given that $q(N_{D}^{+} - N_{A}^{-}) \\approx 0$ in the intrinsic region, the required space charge must come from the mobile carriers: $\\rho(x) \\approx q(p(x)-n(x))$. Therefore, the term $q(p(x)-n(x))$ is not negligible; it is the primary source of the space charge. The condition for the validity of the depletion approximation, $q|p - n| \\ll q|N_{D}^{+} - N_{A}^{-}|$, is severely violated. Thus, the depletion approximation breaks down and cannot be used to model the electric field in this region.\n\nPart 2: Derivation of the effective ambipolar diffusion coefficient, $D_a$.\n\nWe are tasked to find an alternative description of charge transport under high-level injection, which is the ambipolar transport model. We begin with the one-dimensional drift-diffusion equations for electrons and holes:\n$$\nJ_{n} = q\\,n\\,\\mu_{n}\\,E + q\\,D_{n}\\,\\frac{dn}{dx} \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\nJ_{p} = q\\,p\\,\\mu_{p}\\,E - q\\,D_{p}\\,\\frac{dp}{dx} \\quad (2)\n$$\nThe problem specifies the use of the quasi-neutral condition $n(x) = p(x)$ for this derivation. This implies that the spatial gradients are also equal: $\\frac{dn}{dx} = \\frac{dp}{dx}$. We substitute $p=n$ and $dp/dx=dn/dx$ into equation $(2)$:\n$$\nJ_{p} = q\\,n\\,\\mu_{p}\\,E - q\\,D_{p}\\,\\frac{dn}{dx} \\quad (3)\n$$\nOur goal is to eliminate the electric field $E(x)$ from this pair of equations, $(1)$ and $(3)$. We can rearrange both equations to solve for $E$:\nFrom $(1)$:\n$$\nE = \\frac{J_{n}}{q\\,n\\,\\mu_{n}} - \\frac{D_{n}}{\\mu_{n}}\\frac{1}{n}\\frac{dn}{dx} \\quad (4)\n$$\nFrom $(3)$:\n$$\nE = \\frac{J_{p}}{q\\,n\\,\\mu_{p}} + \\frac{D_{p}}{\\mu_{p}}\\frac{1}{n}\\frac{dn}{dx} \\quad (5)\n$$\nEquating expressions $(4)$ and $(5)$ for $E$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{J_{n}}{q\\,n\\,\\mu_{n}} - \\frac{D_{n}}{\\mu_{n}}\\frac{1}{n}\\frac{dn}{dx} = \\frac{J_{p}}{q\\,n\\,\\mu_{p}} + \\frac{D_{p}}{\\mu_{p}}\\frac{1}{n}\\frac{dn}{dx}\n$$\nWe can collect terms involving the current densities on one side and terms involving the carrier gradient on the other:\n$$\n\\frac{J_{n}}{q\\,n\\,\\mu_{n}} - \\frac{J_{p}}{q\\,n\\,\\mu_{p}} = \\left(\\frac{D_{n}}{\\mu_{n}} + \\frac{D_{p}}{\\mu_{p}}\\right) \\frac{1}{n}\\frac{dn}{dx}\n$$\nWe now use the Einstein relations, $D_{n} = \\mu_{n} V_{T}$ and $D_{p} = \\mu_{p} V_{T}$, which implies $\\frac{D_{n}}{\\mu_{n}} = V_{T}$ and $\\frac{D_{p}}{\\mu_{p}} = V_{T}$. Substituting these into the right-hand side:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{q\\,n}\\left(\\frac{J_{n}}{\\mu_{n}} - \\frac{J_{p}}{\\mu_{p}}\\right) = (V_{T} + V_{T}) \\frac{1}{n}\\frac{dn}{dx} = 2V_{T}\\frac{1}{n}\\frac{dn}{dx}\n$$\nMultiplying by $q n$ simplifies the equation to:\n$$\n\\frac{J_{n}}{\\mu_{n}} - \\frac{J_{p}}{\\mu_{p}} = 2qV_{T}\\frac{dn}{dx}\n$$\nThe total current density $J$ is the sum of the electron and hole current densities, $J = J_{n} + J_{p}$. We can express one in terms of the other, for example, $J_{p} = J - J_{n}$. Substituting this into the equation:\n$$\n\\frac{J_{n}}{\\mu_{n}} - \\frac{J - J_{n}}{\\mu_{p}} = 2qV_{T}\\frac{dn}{dx}\n$$\n$$\nJ_{n}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\mu_{n}} + \\frac{1}{\\mu_{p}}\\right) - \\frac{J}{\\mu_{p}} = 2qV_{T}\\frac{dn}{dx}\n$$\nSolving for $J_n$:\n$$\nJ_{n}\\left(\\frac{\\mu_{p} + \\mu_{n}}{\\mu_{n}\\mu_{p}}\\right) = \\frac{J}{\\mu_{p}} + 2qV_{T}\\frac{dn}{dx}\n$$\n$$\nJ_{n} = \\frac{\\mu_{n}\\mu_{p}}{\\mu_{n} + \\mu_{p}}\\left(\\frac{J}{\\mu_{p}} + 2qV_{T}\\frac{dn}{dx}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nJ_{n} = \\frac{\\mu_{n}}{\\mu_{n} + \\mu_{p}}J + q\\left(\\frac{2\\mu_{n}\\mu_{p}V_{T}}{\\mu_{n} + \\mu_{p}}\\right)\\frac{dn}{dx}\n$$\nThis is the ambipolar transport equation for electrons. It shows that the electron current consists of a drift-like component, proportional to the total current $J$, and a diffusion-like component, proportional to the carrier gradient $\\frac{dn}{dx}$. By comparing the diffusion term to its standard form, $q D \\frac{dn}{dx}$, we can identify the effective ambipolar diffusion coefficient, $D_{a}$.\n\nThe coefficient of $q\\frac{dn}{dx}$ is the ambipolar diffusion coefficient $D_a$. From the derived equation, this coefficient is:\n$$\nD_{a} = \\frac{2\\mu_{n}\\mu_{p}V_{T}}{\\mu_{n} + \\mu_{p}}\n$$\nThis expression gives the effective diffusion coefficient for the coupled motion of electrons and holes under high-level injection and quasi-neutrality, expressed in terms of the individual carrier mobilities and the thermal voltage, as required.",

Derivation of Reverse Breakdown Voltage ($V_{\\mathrm{BR}}$)**\n\nWe begin with the one-dimensional Poisson's equation for the space-charge region. In a $p^{+}$-$n$ junction, the $p^{+}$ side is so heavily doped compared to the $n$ side that the depletion region extends almost entirely into the $n$-type drift layer. We can therefore approximate the depletion width on the $p^{+}$ side as zero ($x_p \\approx 0$). Let the metallurgical junction be at $x=0$, with the $n$-region for $x>0$. The space charge density, $\\rho(x)$, in the depletion region of the $n$-side is given by the density of ionized donor atoms, which is assumed to be uniform:\n$$ \\rho(x) = q N_{D} \\quad \\text{for } 0 < x < W $$\nwhere $q$ is the elementary charge, $N_{D}$ is the donor doping concentration, and $W$ is the depletion width.\n\nPoisson's equation relates the electric potential $V(x)$ to the space charge density:\n$$ \\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\varepsilon_s} $$\nwhere $\\varepsilon_s = \\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of the semiconductor. The electric field $E(x)$ is the negative gradient of the potential, $E = -\\frac{dV}{dx}$. Substituting this into Poisson's equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{dE}{dx} = \\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\varepsilon_s} = \\frac{q N_D}{\\varepsilon_s} $$\nTo find the electric field profile, we integrate this equation with respect to $x$. The boundary condition is that the electric field must vanish at the edge of the depletion region, i.e., $E(W) = 0$.\n$$ \\int_{E(x)}^{E(W)} dE' = \\int_{x}^{W} \\frac{q N_D}{\\varepsilon_s} dx' $$\n$$ E(W) - E(x) = \\frac{q N_D}{\\varepsilon_s} (W-x) $$\n$$ 0 - E(x) = \\frac{q N_D}{\\varepsilon_s} (W-x) \\implies E(x) = -\\frac{q N_D}{\\varepsilon_s} (W-x) $$\nThe negative sign indicates the field points in the $-x$ direction (from the positive space charge on the $n$-side to the negative space charge on the $p$-side). The magnitude of the electric field is maximum at the junction ($x=0$):\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{max}} = |E(0)| = \\frac{q N_D W}{\\varepsilon_s} $$\nAvalanche breakdown occurs when this maximum electric field reaches the material's critical electric field, $E_{\\mathrm{crit}}$. At breakdown, the depletion width is denoted $W_{\\mathrm{BR}}$:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{q N_D W_{\\mathrm{BR}}}{\\varepsilon_s} $$\nSolving for $W_{\\mathrm{BR}}$ gives the depletion width at breakdown:\n$$ W_{\\mathrm{BR}} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_s E_{\\mathrm{crit}}}{q N_D} $$\nThe reverse breakdown voltage $V_{\\mathrm{BR}}$ corresponds to the total potential drop across the depletion region at breakdown.

Numerical Calculations**\n\nThe given parameters are:\n$\\varepsilon_{r} = 9.7$\n$\\varepsilon_{0} = 8.854187817 \\times 10^{-14}\\ \\mathrm{F/cm}$\n$q = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}$\n$E_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 2.5 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{V/cm}$\n$N_{D} = 6.0 \\times 10^{15}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$\n$t = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{cm}$\n$V_{\\mathrm{BR,target}} = 1.20\\ \\mathrm{kV} = 1200\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n\nThe semiconductor permittivity is $\\varepsilon_s = \\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0 = 9.7 \\times (8.854187817 \\times 10^{-14}\\ \\mathrm{F/cm}) \\approx 8.58856 \\times 10^{-13}\\ \\mathrm{F/cm}$.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of $V_{\\mathrm{BR}}$ and Verification**\n\nUsing the derived formula for $V_{\\mathrm{BR}}$ with the given $N_{D}$:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{BR}} = \\frac{(8.58856 \\times 10^{-13}\\ \\mathrm{F/cm}) \\times (2.5 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{V/cm})^2}{2 \\times (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}) \\times (6.0 \\times 10^{15}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}})} $$\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{BR}} = \\frac{5.36785}{1.92261 \\times 10^{-3}} \\mathrm{V} \\approx 2791.9\\ \\mathrm{V} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, $V_{\\mathrm{BR}} = 2790\\ \\mathrm{V}$, or $2.79\\ \\mathrm{kV}$.\n\nNext, we verify that punch-through does not occur. This requires the depletion width at breakdown, $W_{\\mathrm{BR}}$, to be less than the physical drift thickness, $t$.\n$$ W_{\\mathrm{BR}} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_s E_{\\mathrm{crit}}}{q N_D} = \\frac{(8.58856 \\times 10^{-13}\\ \\mathrm{F/cm}) \\times (2.5 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{V/cm})}{(1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}) \\times (6.0 \\times 10^{15}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}})} $$\n$$ W_{\\mathrm{BR}} = \\frac{2.14714 \\times 10^{-6}}{9.61306 \\times 10^{-4}} \\mathrm{cm} \\approx 2.2335 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{cm} $$\nWe compare this to the physical thickness $t = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{cm}$. Since $W_{\\mathrm{BR}} \\approx 2.23 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{cm} < t = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{cm}$, the junction experiences avalanche breakdown before punch-through. The assumption of a semi-infinite drift layer is therefore valid for this calculation.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Target Donor Density $N_{D,\\mathrm{target}}$**\n\nWe rearrange the breakdown voltage formula to solve for the donor density $N_{D}$:\n$$ N_{D} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_s E_{\\mathrm{crit}}^2}{2 q V_{\\mathrm{BR}}} $$\nWe use the target breakdown voltage $V_{\\mathrm{BR,target}} = 1200\\ \\mathrm{V}$ to find the required donor density, $N_{D,\\mathrm{target}}$:\n$$ N_{D,\\mathrm{target}} = \\frac{(8.58856 \\times 10^{-13}\\ \\mathrm{F/cm}) \\times (2.5 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{V/cm})^2}{2 \\times (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}) \\times (1200\\ \\mathrm{V})} $$\n$$ N_{D,\\mathrm{target}} = \\frac{5.36785}{3.84522 \\times 10^{-16}} \\mathrm{cm^{-3}} \\approx 1.39598 \\times 10^{16}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the target donor density is $N_{D,\\mathrm{target}} = 1.40 \\times 10^{16}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.\n\nThe final results are $V_{\\mathrm{BR}} = 2.79\\ \\mathrm{kV}$ and $N_{D,\\mathrm{target}} = 1.40 \\times 10^{16}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.",
