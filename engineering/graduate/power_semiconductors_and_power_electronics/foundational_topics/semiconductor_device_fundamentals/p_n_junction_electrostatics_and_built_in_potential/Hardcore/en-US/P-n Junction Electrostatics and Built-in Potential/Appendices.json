It is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe calculation of equilibrium carrier concentrations is based on two fundamental principles for a semiconductor at thermal equilibrium: the law of mass action and the condition of charge neutrality in the quasi-neutral regions.\n\n$1$. **The Law of Mass Action**: In any semiconductor at thermal equilibrium, the product of the electron concentration, $n_0$, and the hole concentration, $p_0$, is a constant equal to the square of the intrinsic carrier concentration, $n_i$.\n$$n_0 p_0 = n_i^2$$\nThis relation holds true throughout the entire device, including both the $p$-type and $n$-type regions.\n\n$2$. **Charge Neutrality**: In the quasi-neutral regions of the semiconductor, far from the junction's space-charge region, the net charge density is effectively zero. The total positive charge (from ionized donors $N_d^+$ and holes $p_0$) must balance the total negative charge (from ionized acceptors $N_a^-$ and electrons $n_0$). The general form of the charge neutrality equation is:\n$$p_0 + N_d^+ = n_0 + N_a^-$$\nThe problem specifies complete dopant ionization, which means all donor and acceptor atoms have contributed their respective free carriers. Therefore, we can state $N_d^+ = N_d$ and $N_a^- = N_a$.\n\n**Carrier Concentrations in the n-type Region**\n\nIn the $n$-type quasi-neutral region, the material is doped with donors, so $N_d = 2.50 \\times 10^{15}\\ \\text{cm}^{-3}$, and we can assume the acceptor concentration is negligible, $N_a = 0$. Using the notation $n_{0,n}$ and $p_{0,n}$ for the equilibrium electron and hole concentrations on the $n$-side, respectively, the charge neutrality equation simplifies to:\n$$p_{0,n} + N_d = n_{0,n}$$\nElectrons are the majority carriers in the $n$-type material, so $n_{0,n} \\gg p_{0,n}$. This is because the donor concentration $N_d$ is many orders of magnitude greater than the intrinsic carrier concentration $n_i$. The charge neutrality equation can therefore be accurately approximated by neglecting the minority carrier term $p_{0,n}$:\n$$n_{0,n} \\approx N_d$$\nThis provides the concentration of majority carriers (electrons) on the $n$-side.\n\nTo find the minority carrier concentration (holes), $p_{0,n}$, we apply the law of mass action:\n$$n_{0,n} p_{0,n} = n_i^2$$\nSubstituting the expression for $n_{0,n}$:\n$$p_{0,n} = \\frac{n_i^2}{n_{0,n}} \\approx \\frac{n_i^2}{N_d}$$\n\n**Carrier Concentrations in the p-type Region**\n\nIn the $p$-type quasi-neutral region, the material is doped with acceptors, so $N_a = 4.00 \\times 10^{17}\\ \\text{cm}^{-3}$, and we assume the donor concentration is negligible, $N_d = 0$. Using the notation $p_{0,p}$ and $n_{0,p}$ for the equilibrium hole and electron concentrations on the $p$-side, respectively, the charge neutrality equation becomes:\n$$p_{0,p} = n_{0,p} + N_a$$\nHoles are the majority carriers in the $p$-type material, so $p_{0,p} \\gg n_{0,p}$. The acceptor concentration $N_a$ is much larger than $n_i$. Thus, the charge neutrality equation can be accurately approximated by neglecting the minority carrier term $n_{0,p}$:\n$$p_{0,p} \\approx N_a$$\nThis gives the concentration of majority carriers (holes) on the $p$-side.\n\nTo find the minority carrier concentration (electrons), $n_{0,p}$, we again use the law of mass action:\n$$n_{0,p} p_{0,p} = n_i^2$$\nSubstituting the expression for $p_{0,p}$:\n$$n_{0,p} = \\frac{n_i^2}{p_{0,p}} \\approx \\frac{n_i^2}{N_a}$$\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into the derived expressions.\nGiven:\n$N_d = 2.50 \\times 10^{15}\\ \\text{cm}^{-3}$\n$N_a = 4.00 \\times 10^{17}\\ \\text{cm}^{-3}$\n$n_i = 1.00 \\times 10^{10}\\ \\text{cm}^{-3}$\n\nFor the $n$-side:\nThe majority electron concentration is:\n$$n_{0,n} \\approx N_d = 2.50 \\times 10^{15}\\ \\text{cm}^{-3}$$\nThe minority hole concentration is:\n$$p_{0,n} \\approx \\frac{n_i^2}{N_d} = \\frac{(1.00 \\times 10^{10})^2}{2.50 \\times 10^{15}} = \\frac{1.00 \\times 10^{20}}{2.50 \\times 10^{15}} = 0.400 \\times 10^5 = 4.00 \\times 10^4\\ \\text{cm}^{-3}$$\n\nFor the $p$-side:\nThe majority hole concentration is:\n$$p_{0,p} \\approx N_a = 4.00 \\times 10^{17}\\ \\text{cm}^{-3}$$\nThe minority electron concentration is:\n$$n_{0,p} \\approx \\frac{n_i^2}{N_a} = \\frac{(1.00 \\times 10^{10})^2}{4.00 \\times 10^{17}} = \\frac{1.00 \\times 10^{20}}{4.00 \\times 10^{17}} = 0.250 \\times 10^3 = 2.50 \\times 10^2\\ \\text{cm}^{-3}$$\n\nThe results, rounded to three significant figures as requested, are:\n$n_{0,\\text{n-side}} = 2.50 \\times 10^{15}\\ \\text{cm}^{-3}$\n$p_{0,\\text{n-side}} = 4.00 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\text{cm}^{-3}$\n$n_{0,\\text{p-side}} = 2.50 \\times 10^{2}\\ \\text{cm}^{-3}$\n$p_{0,\\text{p-side}} = 4.00 \\times 10^{17}\\ \\text{cm}^{-3}$\nThese are to be presented in a single row vector in the order specified by the problem.",

A solution will be developed.\n\n**Derivation of the Built-in Potential ($V_{\\mathrm{bi}}$)**\n\nThe built-in potential, $V_{\\mathrm{bi}}$, arises from the diffusion of mobile charge carriers (electrons and holes) across the metallurgical junction, which leaves behind a region depleted of free carriers, known as the space-charge region or depletion region. This process continues until the electric field established in the depletion region creates a drift current that exactly counteracts the diffusion current, resulting in zero net current flow at thermal equilibrium.\n\nWe can derive the expression for $V_{\\mathrm{bi}}$ by considering the balance of drift and diffusion currents for either electrons or holes. Let's consider the hole current density, $J_p(x)$, which is given by:\n$$J_p(x) = q\\mu_p p(x) E(x) - qD_p \\frac{dp(x)}{dx}$$\nwhere $\\mu_p$ is the hole mobility, $p(x)$ is the hole concentration, $E(x)$ is the electric field, and $D_p$ is the hole diffusion coefficient.\n\nIn thermal equilibrium, there is no net current flow, so $J_p(x) = 0$.\n$$q\\mu_p p(x) E(x) - qD_p \\frac{dp(x)}{dx} = 0$$\nThis implies:\n$$E(x) = \\frac{D_p}{\\mu_p} \\frac{1}{p(x)} \\frac{dp(x)}{dx}$$\nThe ratio of the diffusion coefficient to mobility is given by the Einstein relation:\n$$\\frac{D_p}{\\mu_p} = \\frac{k_B T}{q} \\equiv V_T$$\nwhere $V_T$ is the thermal voltage. Substituting this into the expression for the electric field gives:\n$$E(x) = V_T \\frac{1}{p(x)} \\frac{dp(x)}{dx}$$\nThe built-in potential $V_{\\mathrm{bi}}$ is defined as the total potential difference across the junction. By convention, the potential of the $n$-side is higher than that of the $p$-side, so $V_{\\mathrm{bi}} = V_n - V_p$. The electric field is the negative gradient of the electrostatic potential, $E(x) = -\\frac{dV(x)}{dx}$. Therefore, we can find $V_{\\mathrm{bi}}$ by integrating the electric field from the edge of the depletion region on the $p$-side (let's say at $x=x_p$) to the edge on the $n$-side (at $x=x_n$):\n$$V_{\\mathrm{bi}} = V(x_n) - V(x_p) = -\\int_{x_p}^{x_n} E(x)dx$$\nSubstituting our expression for $E(x)$:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{bi}} = -\\int_{x_p}^{x_n} V_T \\frac{1}{p(x)} \\frac{dp(x)}{dx} dx$$\nWe change the variable of integration from position $x$ to hole concentration $p$. The limits of integration become the hole concentrations in the quasi-neutral regions outside the depletion layer. On the $p$-side, the hole concentration is $p(x_p) = p_p$, and on the $n$-side, it is $p(x_n) = p_n$.\n$$V_{\\mathrm{bi}} = -V_T \\int_{p_p}^{p_n} \\frac{1}{p} dp = -V_T \\left[ \\ln(p) \\right]_{p_p}^{p_n} = -V_T (\\ln(p_n) - \\ln(p_p))$$\n$$V_{\\mathrm{bi}} = V_T \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_p}{p_n}\\right)$$\nNow we must relate $p_p$ and $p_n$ to the given doping concentrations.\nIn the quasi-neutral $p$-type region, assuming complete ionization, the majority carrier (hole) concentration is approximately equal to the net acceptor concentration: $p_p \\approx N_A$.\nIn the quasi-neutral $n$-type region, the majority carrier (electron) concentration is $n_n \\approx N_D$. The minority carrier (hole) concentration $p_n$ is determined by the mass action law, $np = n_i^2$. Therefore, $p_n = \\frac{n_i^2}{n_n} \\approx \\frac{n_i^2}{N_D}$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions for $p_p$ and $p_n$ into our equation for $V_{\\mathrm{bi}}$:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{bi}} = V_T \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A}{n_i^2/N_D}\\right) = V_T \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A N_D}{n_i^2}\\right)$$\nReplacing $V_T$ with its definition, we arrive at the final analytical expression for the built-in potential in terms of the specified parameters:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{bi}} = \\frac{k_B T}{q} \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A N_D}{n_i^2}\\right)$$\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n$N_A = 9 \\times 10^{15}\\ \\text{cm}^{-3}$\n$N_D = 10^{16}\\ \\text{cm}^{-3}$\n$n_i = 1.0 \\times 10^{10}\\ \\text{cm}^{-3}$\n$T = 300\\ \\text{K}$\n$k_B = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\text{J/K}$\n$q = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\text{C}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the thermal voltage, $V_T$:\n$$V_T = \\frac{k_B T}{q} = \\frac{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\text{J/K})(300\\ \\text{K})}{1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\text{C}} \\approx 0.02585202\\ \\text{V}$$\nNext, we evaluate the argument of the natural logarithm.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe analysis begins from fundamental principles as requested.\n\n**1. Built-in Potential ($V_{bi}$)**\nAt thermal equilibrium, the Fermi level $E_F$ is constant throughout the device. The built-in potential, $V_{bi}$, is the potential difference across the junction required to align the Fermi levels of the isolated $p$ and $n$ regions. It is given by the difference in their work functions or, equivalently, by the carrier concentrations.\n\nThe thermal voltage is defined as $V_T = \\frac{k_B T}{q}$.\nAssuming complete ionization and non-degenerate doping, the majority carrier concentrations in the neutral regions are:\n-   Hole concentration in the $p$ region: $p_p \\approx N_a$.\n-   Electron concentration in the $n$ region: $n_n \\approx N_d$.\n\nThe built-in potential can be expressed as:\n$$ V_{bi} = V_T \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_p n_n}{n_i^2}\\right) $$\nSubstituting the majority carrier concentrations, we get:\n$$ V_{bi} = V_T \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_a N_d}{n_i^2}\\right) $$\n\n**2. Poisson's Equation and the Depletion Approximation**\nThe problem specifies using the depletion approximation. This assumes that within the space-charge region (SCR), extending from $x = -x_p$ on the $p$ side to $x = x_n$ on the $n$ side, the mobile carrier concentration is negligible compared to the ionized dopant concentration. The net space-charge density $\\rho(x)$ is therefore:\n$$ \\rho(x) = \\begin{cases} -q N_a  \\text{for } -x_p \\le x  0 \\\\ q N_d  \\text{for } 0  x \\le x_n \\\\ 0  \\text{elsewhere} \\end{cases} $$\nPoisson's equation relates the electrostatic potential $V(x)$ to the space-charge density $\\rho(x)$:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 V}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\epsilon_{Si}} $$\nwhere $\\epsilon_{Si} = \\epsilon_r \\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of silicon.\n\nThe overall device must be charge neutral, which implies the total negative charge on the $p$ side of the SCR must equal the total positive charge on the $n$ side:\n$$ q N_a x_p = q N_d x_n $$\nThis gives the relation $x_p = \\frac{N_d}{N_a} x_n$.\n\n**3. Electric Field and Potential**\nIntegrating Poisson's equation once gives the electric field $E(x) = -\\frac{dV}{dx}$. We apply the boundary condition that the electric field must be zero at the edges of the depletion region, i.e., $E(-x_p) = 0$ and $E(x_n) = 0$.\n\nFor the $n$ region ($0  x \\le x_n$):\n$$ E(x) = \\int_{x}^{x_n} \\frac{q N_d}{\\epsilon_{Si}} dx' = \\frac{q N_d}{\\epsilon_{Si}} (x_n - x) $$\nFor the $p$ region ($-x_p \\le x  0$):\n$$ E(x) = \\int_{-x_p}^{x} \\frac{-q N_a}{\\epsilon_{Si}} dx' = -\\frac{q N_a}{\\epsilon_{Si}} (x + x_p) $$\nThe electric field is continuous at $x=0$, with its peak value $E_{max} = E(0) = \\frac{q N_d x_n}{\\epsilon_{Si}} = -\\frac{q N_a (-x_p)}{\\epsilon_{Si}}$.\n\nIntegrating the electric field gives the potential profile $V(x)$, up to an arbitrary constant. We set $V(-x_p) = 0$. The potential difference across the junction is the built-in potential, $V(x_n) - V(-x_p) = V_{bi}$.\n$$ V_{bi} = -\\int_{-x_p}^{x_n} E(x) dx = -\\left( \\int_{-x_p}^{0} -\\frac{q N_a}{\\epsilon_{Si}} (x + x_p) dx + \\int_{0}^{x_n} \\frac{q N_d}{\\epsilon_{Si}} (x_n - x) dx \\right) $$\n$$ V_{bi} = \\frac{q N_a}{\\epsilon_{Si}} \\left[ \\frac{x^2}{2} + x_p x \\right]_{-x_p}^{0} - \\frac{q N_d}{\\epsilon_{Si}} \\left[ x_n x - \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right]_{0}^{x_n} $$\n$$ V_{bi} = \\frac{q N_a x_p^2}{2 \\epsilon_{Si}} + \\frac{q N_d x_n^2}{2 \\epsilon_{Si}} $$\nUsing the charge neutrality condition $N_a x_p = N_d x_n$, we can write $x_p = \\frac{N_d}{N_a} x_n$. Substituting this into the $V_{bi}$ expression:\n$$ V_{bi} = \\frac{q}{2 \\epsilon_{Si}} \\left( N_a \\left(\\frac{N_d}{N_a}\\right)^2 x_n^2 + N_d x_n^2 \\right) = \\frac{q N_d x_n^2}{2 \\epsilon_{Si}} \\left(\\frac{N_d}{N_a} + 1\\right) $$\nSolving for $x_n$:\n$$ x_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\epsilon_{Si} V_{bi}}{q N_d \\left(1 + \\frac{N_d}{N_a}\\right)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\epsilon_{Si} V_{bi}}{q} \\frac{N_a}{N_d(N_a + N_d)}} $$\nThe total depletion width is $W = x_p + x_n = x_n(1 + \\frac{N_d}{N_a})$. Substituting the expression for $x_n$:\n$$ W = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\epsilon_{Si} V_{bi}}{q N_d \\left(1 + \\frac{N_d}{N_a}\\right)}} \\left(1 + \\frac{N_d}{N_a}\\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\epsilon_{Si} V_{bi} (1 + \\frac{N_d}{N_a})}{q N_d}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\epsilon_{Si} V_{bi}}{q} \\left(\\frac{1}{N_d} + \\frac{1}{N_a}\\right)} $$\n\n**4. One-Sided Junction ($p^{+}-n$) Approximation**\nThe problem specifies a $p^{+}-n$ junction where $N_a = 10^{19}\\ \\text{cm}^{-3}}$ and $N_d = 10^{14}\\ \\text{cm}^{-3}}$. Since $N_a \\gg N_d$, we can make the one-sided approximation.\n-   From charge neutrality $N_a x_p = N_d x_n$, we see that $x_p = (\\frac{N_d}{N_a}) x_n \\ll x_n$.\n-   The total depletion width $W = x_p + x_n \\approx x_n$.\n-   In the expression for $W$, the term $\\frac{1}{N_a}$ is negligible compared to $\\frac{1}{N_d}$.\nTherefore, the expression for the total width simplifies to:\n$$ W \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\epsilon_{Si} V_{bi}}{q N_d}} $$\nAnd since $W \\approx x_n$, we have:\n$$ x_n \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\epsilon_{Si} V_{bi}}{q N_d}} $$\n\n**5. Numerical Calculation**\nFirst, we calculate the constants and intermediate values in the specified units ($\\text{cm}$, $\\text{V}$, $\\text{C}$).\n-   Thermal voltage at $T = 300\\ \\text{K}$:\n    $V_T = \\frac{k_B T}{q} = \\frac{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\text{J/K})(300\\ \\text{K})}{1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\text{C}} \\approx 0.025852\\ \\text{V}$.\n-   Built-in potential $V_{bi}$:\n    $V_{bi} = V_T \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_a N_d}{n_i^2}\\right) = (0.025852\\ \\text{V}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{(1.00 \\times 10^{19})(1.00 \\times 10^{14})}{(1.00 \\times 10^{10})^2}\\right) = (0.025852\\ \\text{V}) \\ln(10^{13}) \\approx 0.7738\\ \\text{V}$.\n-   Permittivity of silicon $\\epsilon_{Si}$:\n    $\\epsilon_{Si} = \\epsilon_r \\epsilon_0 = (11.7)(8.854187...\\times 10^{-14}\\ \\text{F/cm}) \\approx 1.03596 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\text{F/cm}$.\n\nNow we can calculate the total depletion width $W$:\n$$ W \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\epsilon_{Si} V_{bi}}{q N_d}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{2 (1.03596 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\text{F/cm}) (0.7738\\ \\text{V})}{(1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\text{C}) (1.00 \\times 10^{14}\\ \\text{cm}^{-3})}} $$\n$$ W \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{1.6033 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\text{C/cm}}{1.602177 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{C/cm^3}}} \\approx \\sqrt{1.0007 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\text{cm^2}} \\approx 3.1634 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\text{cm} $$\n\nThe depletion width on the $n$ side, $x_n$, is approximately equal to $W$. So, $x_n \\approx 3.1634 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\text{cm}$.\nThe problem requires the value of $W$ in micrometers and rounded to three significant figures.\n$1\\ \\text{cm} = 10^4\\ \\mu\\text{m}$.\n$$ W \\approx (3.1634 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\text{cm}) \\times (10^4\\ \\mu\\text{m/cm}) \\approx 3.1634\\ \\mu\\text{m} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $W = 3.16\\ \\mu\\text{m}$.\n\n**6. Comparison with PiN Diodes**\nA PiN diode used in high-voltage power electronics is designed to block large reverse voltages. This is achieved by inserting a wide, lightly doped (or intrinsic) 'i' region between the heavily doped $p^{+}$ and $n^{+}$ regions. This intrinsic layer constitutes the drift region. To support a high reverse voltage (e.g., hundreds or thousands of volts) while keeping the electric field below the material's breakdown limit, this drift region must be very wide, typically on the order of tens to hundreds of micrometers.\n\nThe calculated equilibrium depletion width $W \\approx 3.16\\ \\mu\\text{m}$ for the simple $p^{+}-n$ junction is significantly smaller than the typical drift region thickness of a high-voltage PiN power diode. The equilibrium width is merely the starting point; while it expands under reverse bias, the fundamental design of a PiN diode involves fabricating a drift region that is orders of magnitude thicker to begin with, specifically for the purpose of high-voltage blocking.",
