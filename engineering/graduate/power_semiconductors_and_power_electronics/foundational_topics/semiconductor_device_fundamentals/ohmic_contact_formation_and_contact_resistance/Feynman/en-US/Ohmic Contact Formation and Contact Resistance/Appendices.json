            "introduction": "To truly grasp the nature of an ohmic contact, we must move beyond the simple picture of uniform current flow. In reality, current crowds near the leading edge of the contact, transferring from the metal to the semiconductor over a finite distance. This practice  challenges you to derive the spatial distribution of this current injection and identify the emergent characteristic scale known as the transfer length, $L_{T}$. By calculating the portion of current transferred within this length, you will develop a deep, physical intuition for why $L_{T}$ is the most critical parameter governing contact behavior.",

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Governing Differential Equation**\n\nWe are given three fundamental relations:\n1. $j_{c}(x)=\\frac{V_{m}-V_{s}(x)}{\\rho_{c}}$\n2. $i_{s}(x)=-\\frac{W}{R_{\\text{sh}}}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{s}}{\\mathrm{d}x}$\n3. $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}i_{s}}{\\mathrm{d}x}=-W\\,j_{c}(x)$\n\nWe can combine these to obtain a single differential equation for the semiconductor potential $V_{s}(x)$. First, differentiate equation (2) with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}i_{s}}{\\mathrm{d}x} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(-\\frac{W}{R_{\\text{sh}}}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{s}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right) = -\\frac{W}{R_{\\text{sh}}}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2V_{s}}{\\mathrm{d}x^2}\n$$\nNow, substitute this expression and equation (1) into equation (3):\n$$\n-\\frac{W}{R_{\\text{sh}}}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2V_{s}}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} = -W\\,j_{c}(x) = -W\\left(\\frac{V_{m}-V_{s}(x)}{\\rho_{c}}\\right)\n$$\nDividing by $-W$ and rearranging gives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{R_{\\text{sh}}}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2V_{s}}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} = \\frac{V_{s}(x)-V_{m}}{\\rho_{c}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2V_{s}}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} = \\frac{R_{\\text{sh}}}{\\rho_{c}} (V_{s}(x)-V_{m})\n$$\nLet's define a potential difference $\\Delta V(x) = V_{s}(x) - V_{m}$. Since $V_m$ is a constant, $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2(\\Delta V)}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2V_{s}}{\\mathrm{d}x^2}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2(\\Delta V)}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} - \\frac{R_{\\text{sh}}}{\\rho_{c}} \\Delta V(x) = 0\n$$\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation. We define a characteristic length, the transfer length $L_{T}$, such that:\n$$\nL_{T}^2 = \\frac{\\rho_{c}}{R_{\\text{sh}}} \\implies L_{T} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho_{c}}{R_{\\text{sh}}}}\n$$\nThe differential equation is now:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2(\\Delta V)}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} - \\frac{1}{L_{T}^2} \\Delta V(x) = 0\n$$\nThe general solution is of the form:\n$$\n\\Delta V(x) = A \\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{L_{T}}\\right) + B \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_{T}}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants determined by boundary conditions. For a contact extending to infinity ($x \\to \\infty$), we expect all physical quantities like current and potential differences to decay to zero. As $x \\to \\infty$, $\\Delta V(x) = V_s(x) - V_m \\to 0$. The term $A \\exp(x/L_{T})$ grows infinitely, which is unphysical. Therefore, we must set $A=0$. The solution becomes:\n$$\n\\Delta V(x) = B \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_{T}}\\right)\n$$\nAt $x=0$, we have $\\Delta V(0) = B$. Thus, $B = V_{s}(0) - V_{m}$. The specific solution for the potential difference is:\n$$\nV_{s}(x) - V_{m} = (V_{s}(0)-V_{m})\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_{T}}\\right)\n$$\n\n**Spatial Form of $j_{c}(x)$ and the Transfer Length**\n\nThe interfacial current density $j_{c}(x)$ is given by:\n$$\nj_{c}(x) = \\frac{V_{m}-V_{s}(x)}{\\rho_{c}} = -\\frac{V_{s}(x)-V_{m}}{\\rho_{c}}\n$$\nSubstituting our solution for the potential difference:\n$$\nj_{c}(x) = -\\frac{(V_{s}(0)-V_{m})}{\\rho_{c}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_{T}}\\right)\n$$\nAt $x=0$, the current density is $j_{c}(0) = -\\frac{(V_{s}(0)-V_{m})}{\\rho_{c}}$. Therefore, the spatial form of $j_{c}(x)$ is:\n$$\nj_{c}(x) = j_{c}(0)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_{T}}\\right)\n$$\nThis shows that the current density decays exponentially along the contact length $x$. The characteristic decay length is the transfer length, which we have identified as $L_{T} = \\sqrt{\\rho_c/R_{\\text{sh}}}$.\n\n**Fraction of Injected Current**\n\nThe total current $I_{total}$ that enters the semiconductor from the metal is the integral of the current density $j_{c}(x)$ over the entire contact area. For a contact of width $W$, this is:\n$$\nI_{total} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} j_{c}(x) W \\,\\mathrm{d}x = W \\int_{0}^{\\infty} j_{c}(0)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_{T}}\\right) \\,\\mathrm{d}x\n$$\n$$\nI_{total} = W j_{c}(0) \\left[-L_{T} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_{T}}\\right)\\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = W j_{c}(0) \\left(0 - (-L_{T})\\right) = W j_{c}(0) L_{T}\n$$\nThe current $I(n)$ that enters the semiconductor within the first $n$ multiples of the transfer length (i.e., from $x=0$ to $x=nL_{T}$) is:\n$$\nI(n) = \\int_{0}^{nL_{T}} j_{c}(x) W \\,\\mathrm{d}x = W \\int_{0}^{nL_{T}} j_{c}(0)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_{T}}\\right) \\,\\mathrm{d}x\n$$\n$$\nI(n) = W j_{c}(0) \\left[-L_{T} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_{T}}\\right)\\right]_{0}^{nL_{T}} = W j_{c}(0) \\left(-L_{T} \\exp(-n) - (-L_{T})\\right) = W j_{c}(0) L_{T} (1 - \\exp(-n))\n$$\nThe fraction $F(n)$ is the ratio of $I(n)$ to $I_{total}$:\n$$\nF(n) = \\frac{I(n)}{I_{total}} = \\frac{W j_{c}(0) L_{T} (1 - \\exp(-n))}{W j_{c}(0) L_{T}} = 1 - \\exp(-n)\n$$\nThis is the required expression for the fraction of the cumulative injected current.\n\n**Value of $n$ for $95\\%$ Current Injection**\n\nWe need to find the value of $n$ such that $F(n)=0.95$.\n$$\n1 - \\exp(-n) = 0.95\n$$\n$$\n\\exp(-n) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05\n$$\nTo express $0.05$ as a fraction, $0.05 = \\frac{5}{100} = \\frac{1}{20}$.\n$$\n\\exp(-n) = \\frac{1}{20}\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln(\\exp(-n)) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{20}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n-n = -\\ln(20)\n$$\n$$\nn = \\ln(20)\n$$\nThis is the exact symbolic value for $n$.\nThe two required results are the function $F(n)$ and the specific value of $n$.",

            "problem": "A heavily doped source/drain ohmic contact is formed on a silicon carbide (SiC) power device. To characterize the electrical coupling between the metal contact and the semiconductor underlayer, the Transmission Line Model (TLM) test structure is used, and the sheet resistance of the semiconductor beneath the contact, denoted as $R_{s}$, along with the single-contact resistance $R_{c}$ (for a contact of finite width $W$ and length $L_{c}$) are extracted from measurements. Consider the distributed resistive coupling between the metal and the semiconductor under the contact: an in-plane sheet current density flows laterally under the contact driven by the in-plane electric field, and a vertical current density flows into the metal driven by the local potential difference across the contact interface. The interface is characterized by the specific contact resistivity $\\rho_{c}$, defined by a linear local relation between the vertical current density and the potential difference. The contact resistance is the net resistance between the metal and the semiconductor for a single contact pad of length $L_c$ and width $W$.\n\nStarting from the definitions of sheet resistance, Ohm's law for conduction in the sheet, and the local linear relation between the vertical current density and the interface potential difference, derive the governing differential equation for the potential under the contact, obtain the transfer length $L_{T}$ as the emergent length scale from this equation, and relate the single-contact resistance normalized to width, $R_{c}' \\equiv R_{c} W$, to $\\rho_c$, $R_s$, and $L_c$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. All provided information is scientifically grounded in the field of semiconductor device physics, specifically concerning the characterization of ohmic contacts using the Transmission Line Model (TLM). The premises are self-contained, factually sound, and well-posed, providing a clear path to a unique solution. The given parameters are physically realistic for silicon carbide (SiC) power devices. The problem is objective and free of ambiguities.\n\nThe derivation proceeds by modeling the distributed resistance of the metal-semiconductor contact. We consider a differential slice of the contact of length $dx$ and width $W$ at a position $x$ along the contact length $L_c$, where $x=0$ is the leading edge where current enters the semiconductor sheet under the contact.\n\nLet $V(x)$ be the potential in the resistive semiconductor sheet at position $x$, relative to the potential of the overlying metal contact, which is assumed to be an equipotential (i.e., at a potential of $0$). Let $I(x)$ be the lateral current flowing in the semiconductor sheet at position $x$.\n\nAccording to Ohm's law, the voltage drop $dV$ across the differential length $dx$ of the semiconductor sheet is given by the sheet current $I(x)$ and the sheet resistance of that element, which is $R_s \\frac{dx}{W}$. Thus,\n$$\ndV = -I(x) \\left( \\frac{R_s}{W} \\right) dx \\implies \\frac{dV(x)}{dx} = -\\frac{R_s}{W} I(x)\n$$\n\nThe change in the sheet current, $dI$, over the length $dx$ is equal to the current that flows vertically from the semiconductor into the metal contact. Let $J_v(x)$ be the vertical current density across the interface. The total vertical current in the differential slice is $J_v(x) W dx$. This vertical current reduces the lateral current in the sheet, so $dI = -J_v(x) W dx$. This gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dI(x)}{dx} = -W J_v(x)\n$$\n\nThe problem states that the specific contact resistivity, $\\rho_c$, is defined by a linear local relation between the vertical current density and the potential difference across the interface. This potential difference is $V(x)$. Therefore,\n$$\nJ_v(x) = \\frac{V(x)}{\\rho_c}\n$$\nwhere $\\rho_c$ has units of $\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^2$.\n\nWe can now combine these three equations to find the governing differential equation for the potential $V(x)$. First, we differentiate the equation for $dV/dx$ with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2V(x)}{dx^2} = -\\frac{R_s}{W} \\frac{dI(x)}{dx}\n$$\nNext, we substitute the expression for $dI/dx$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2V(x)}{dx^2} = -\\frac{R_s}{W} \\left( -W J_v(x) \\right) = R_s J_v(x)\n$$\nFinally, we substitute the expression for $J_v(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2V(x)}{dx^2} = R_s \\left( \\frac{V(x)}{\\rho_c} \\right) = \\frac{R_s}{\\rho_c} V(x)\n$$\nRearranging this gives the governing second-order linear homogeneous differential equation for the potential under the contact:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2V(x)}{dx^2} - \\frac{R_s}{\\rho_c} V(x) = 0\n$$\nThis equation is of the form $\\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} - \\frac{1}{L_T^2}V = 0$. By comparison, we identify the emergent characteristic length scale, known as the transfer length $L_T$, as:\n$$\nL_T = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho_c}{R_s}}\n$$\n\nTo find the contact resistance $R_c$, we solve the differential equation. The general solution is $V(x) = A e^{x/L_T} + B e^{-x/L_T}$. We apply boundary conditions. At the end of the contact, $x=L_c$, no more current can flow in the semiconductor sheet, so $I(L_c) = 0$. Since $I(x) = -\\frac{W}{R_s} \\frac{dV(x)}{dx}$, this implies $\\frac{dV}{dx}|_{x=L_c} = 0$. Applying this to the derivative $\\frac{dV}{dx} = \\frac{A}{L_T} e^{x/L_T} - \\frac{B}{L_T} e^{-x/L_T}$ gives $A e^{L_c/L_T} = B e^{-L_c/L_T}$. It is more convenient to write the general solution in terms of hyperbolic functions centered at $x=L_c$: $V(x) = C \\cosh(\\frac{x-L_c}{L_T}) + D \\sinh(\\frac{x-L_c}{L_T})$. The boundary condition $\\frac{dV}{dx}|_{x=L_c}=0$ immediately implies $D=0$, so $V(x) = C \\cosh(\\frac{x-L_c}{L_T})$.\n\nThe total current $I_0$ entering the contact at $x=0$ is $I(0)$. The input potential is $V_0 = V(0)$. The contact resistance is $R_c = V_0/I_0$.\n$$\nV_0 = V(0) = C \\cosh\\left(\\frac{-L_c}{L_T}\\right) = C \\cosh\\left(\\frac{L_c}{L_T}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nI(x) = -\\frac{W}{R_s} \\frac{dV}{dx} = -\\frac{W C}{R_s L_T} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x-L_c}{L_T}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nI_0 = I(0) = -\\frac{W C}{R_s L_T} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{-L_c}{L_T}\\right) = \\frac{W C}{R_s L_T} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{L_c}{L_T}\\right)\n$$\nThe contact resistance $R_c$ is therefore:\n$$\nR_c = \\frac{V_0}{I_0} = \\frac{C \\cosh(L_c/L_T)}{\\frac{W C}{R_s L_T} \\sinh(L_c/L_T)} = \\frac{R_s L_T}{W} \\coth\\left(\\frac{L_c}{L_T}\\right)\n$$\nThe contact resistance normalized to width, $R_c' = R_c W$, is:\n$$\nR_c' = R_s L_T \\coth\\left(\\frac{L_c}{L_T}\\right) = \\sqrt{\\rho_c R_s} \\coth\\left(\\frac{L_c}{L_T}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem specifies using the limit appropriate for when the contact length is much larger than the transfer length, i.e., $L_c \\gg L_T$. In this limit, the argument of the hyperbolic cotangent is large, and $\\coth(z) \\to 1$ as $z \\to \\infty$. Thus, the expression for $R_c'$ simplifies to:\n$$\nR_c' \\approx R_s L_T\n$$\n\nWe now use the given numerical values to compute $L_T$ and $\\rho_c$.\nThe givens are:\n$R_s = 1000~\\Omega/\\square$\n$R_c = 5.0~\\Omega$\n$W = 50~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n$L_c = 10~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the contact resistance normalized to width, $R_c'$:\n$$\nR_c' = R_c W = (5.0~\\Omega) \\times (50~\\mu\\mathrm{m}) = 250~\\Omega\\cdot\\mu\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nUsing the simplified relation, we find the transfer length $L_T$:\n$$\nL_T = \\frac{R_c'}{R_s} = \\frac{250~\\Omega\\cdot\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{1000~\\Omega/\\square} = 0.25~\\mu\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nAs a check, we verify the validity of the approximation $L_c \\gg L_T$.

            "solution": "We begin from the fundamental relation for Joule heating per unit area at the contact: $q'' = P/A = J^2 \\rho_c$, where $q''$ is the heat flux leaving the contact, $J$ is the current density, and $\\rho_c$ is the specific contact resistivity. The temperature rise at the contact relative to ambient is linked to the heat flux through the thermal resistance per unit area: $\\Delta T = q'' R_{\\mathrm{th,eff}}$, where $R_{\\mathrm{th,eff}}$ is the area-specific thermal resistance between the contact and the ambient.\n\nThe thermal network comprises multiple conduction paths in parallel, each path being a series of thermal resistances. For a branch $\\mathcal{B}_i$ with series resistances $R_{i,1}, R_{i,2}, \\dots$, the total branch resistance is $R_i = \\sum_j R_{i,j}$. With branches in parallel, the effective resistance to ambient is given by the reciprocal sum:\n$$\\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{th,eff}}} = \\sum_i \\frac{1}{R_i}, \\quad \\text{so} \\quad R_{\\mathrm{th,eff}} = \\left(\\sum_i \\frac{1}{R_i}\\right)^{-1}.$$\n\nThe contact resistivity varies with temperature according to a first-order expansion about a reference temperature:\n$$\\rho_c(T) = \\rho_{c,0}\\left[1 + \\alpha \\left(T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right)\\right],$$\nwhere $\\rho_{c,0}$ is the specific contact resistivity at $T_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, and $\\alpha$ is the temperature coefficient. Under steady-state, the contact temperature is $T_{\\mathrm{amb}} + \\Delta T$, so the specific contact resistivity at the operating point is\n$$\\rho_c\\left(T_{\\mathrm{amb}} + \\Delta T\\right) = \\rho_{c,0}\\left[1 + \\alpha \\left(T_{\\mathrm{amb}} + \\Delta T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right)\\right].$$\n\nThe heat flux is thus\n$$q'' = J^2 \\rho_{c,0}\\left[1 + \\alpha \\left(T_{\\mathrm{amb}} + \\Delta T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right)\\right],$$\nand the thermal relation gives\n$$\\Delta T = q'' R_{\\mathrm{th,eff}} = J^2 \\rho_{c,0} R_{\\mathrm{th,eff}} \\left[1 + \\alpha \\left(T_{\\mathrm{amb}} + \\Delta T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right)\\right].$$\n\nDefine the coupling constant\n$$C \\equiv J^2 \\rho_{c,0} R_{\\mathrm{th,eff}},$$\nwhich aggregates the electrical loading and the thermal impedance. Substituting gives\n$$\\Delta T = C \\left[1 + \\alpha \\left(T_{\\mathrm{amb}} - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right) + \\alpha \\Delta T\\right].$$\n\nRearranging to solve for $\\Delta T$ yields a linear equation:\n$$\\Delta T - C \\alpha \\Delta T = C \\left[1 + \\alpha \\left(T_{\\mathrm{amb}} - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right)\\right],$$\nso\n$$\\Delta T = \\frac{C \\left[1 + \\alpha \\left(T_{\\mathrm{amb}} - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right)\\right]}{1 - C \\alpha}.$$\n\nThis expression reveals a stability condition. If $1 - C \\alpha \\leq 0$, then the denominator is non-positive and the linearized model predicts that no finite steady-state $\\Delta T$ exists (thermal runaway in this linear model). Physically, a positive temperature coefficient $\\alpha  0$ can amplify heating with temperature, while a negative coefficient can stabilize the system.\n\nAlgorithmic steps for each test case:\n1. Compute each branch’s series sum $R_i = \\sum_j R_{i,j}$ and then compute the effective area-specific thermal resistance $R_{\\mathrm{th,eff}} = \\left(\\sum_i 1/R_i\\right)^{-1}$.\n2. Compute $C = J^2 \\rho_{c,0} R_{\\mathrm{th,eff}}$.\n3. Compute the denominator $D = 1 - C \\alpha$.\n4. If $D \\leq 0$, return a floating-point infinity. Otherwise, compute\n   $$\\Delta T = \\frac{C \\left[1 + \\alpha \\left(T_{\\mathrm{amb}} - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right)\\right]}{D}.$$\n5. Round the resulting $\\Delta T$ to six decimal places and report in Kelvin.\n\nThis approach strictly adheres to fundamental definitions: Joule heating, thermal resistance combination rules (series and parallel), and a first-order temperature dependence for contact resistivity. It produces a unique and testable numeric output for each case, and it properly flags the instability condition when the linear model cannot yield a finite steady state. The computation is universal and relies only on arithmetic and the provided parameters, making it implementable in any modern programming language. The final program aggregates the results into a single line in the specified format.",
