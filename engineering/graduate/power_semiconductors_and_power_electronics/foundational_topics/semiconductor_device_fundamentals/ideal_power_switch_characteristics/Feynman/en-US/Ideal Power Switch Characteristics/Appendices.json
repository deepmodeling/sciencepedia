            "problem": "A direct current step-down (buck) converter is supplied by an ideal direct current source of magnitude $V_{\\text{dc}}  0$. The converter comprises an ideal controlled main switch $S$, an ideal freewheel diode $D$, an ideal inductor $L$, and an ideal output capacitor such that the inductor current $i_L(t)$ is strictly positive for all time in steady-state operation (Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM)). The switching node is denoted $a$. The diode is connected from ground to node $a$ with its anode at ground and its cathode at node $a$. The main switch $S$ is connected between the source and node $a$. The control signal is a $T_s$-periodic gating function $u(t) \\in \\{0,1\\}$ that sets the main switch $S$ on when $u(t)=1$ and off when $u(t)=0$.\n\nAdopt the following polarity conventions for device variables:\n- For the main switch $S$: define the device voltage $v_S(t)$ as the potential at the source-side terminal minus the potential at node $a$, and define the device current $i_S(t)$ as positive flowing from the source-side terminal to node $a$.\n- For the diode $D$: define the device voltage $v_D(t)$ as the anode potential (ground) minus the cathode potential (node $a$), and define the device current $i_D(t)$ as positive flowing from anode to cathode (from ground to node $a$).\n\nUsing only fundamental laws (Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law and Kirchhoff’s Current Law) and ideal device constraints, construct piecewise-consistent waveform polarities for $v_S(t)$, $i_S(t)$, $v_D(t)$, and $i_D(t)$ over one switching period that satisfy the ideal switch complementarity condition $v(t)\\,i(t)=0$ for each device.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it describes a standard, albeit idealized, scenario in power electronics that is scientifically grounded and well-posed. The objective is to compute the average power dissipated in the semiconductor devices of an ideal buck converter. This will be accomplished by analyzing the circuit's operation over one switching period and applying the definitions of ideal components.\n\nThe analysis is performed over a single switching period of duration $T_s$. The period is divided into two intervals based on the state of the main switch $S$, which is controlled by the gating function $u(t)$. Let $D$ be the duty cycle, such that the switch $S$ is on for $t \\in (0, DT_s]$ and off for $t \\in (DT_s, T_s]$.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between currents at the switching node $a$. Let the inductor current $i_L(t)$ be defined as positive flowing from node $a$ to the output. The current from the source through the switch, $i_S(t)$, flows into node $a$. The current through the diode, $i_D(t)$, is defined as positive flowing from ground to node $a$, so it also flows into node $a$. Applying Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at node $a$:\n$$i_S(t) + i_D(t) = i_L(t)$$\n\nNow, we analyze the circuit in each of the two switching intervals.\n\n**Interval 1: $0  t \\leq DT_s$ (Switch $S$ is ON)**\n\nWhen the main switch $S$ is ON ($u(t)=1$), it behaves as an ideal closed switch. By definition, an ideal closed switch has zero voltage drop across it.\n$$v_S(t) = 0$$\nThe switch connects the DC source of voltage $V_{\\text{dc}}$ directly to the switching node $a$. Therefore, the potential at node $a$, denoted $V_a(t)$, is equal to the source voltage.\n$$V_a(t) = V_{\\text{dc}}$$\nThe voltage across the diode $v_D(t)$ is defined as the anode potential (ground, $0$) minus the cathode potential (node $a$).\n$$v_D(t) = 0 - V_a(t) = -V_{\\text{dc}}$$\nSince the problem states $V_{\\text{dc}}  0$, the voltage across the diode is negative, meaning the diode is reverse-biased. An ideal diode under reverse bias conducts zero current.\n$$i_D(t) = 0$$\nUsing the KCL equation at node $a$:\n$$i_S(t) + 0 = i_L(t) \\implies i_S(t) = i_L(t)$$\nThe problem specifies that the converter operates in Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM), meaning the inductor current is strictly positive for all time, $i_L(t)  0$. Consequently, $i_S(t)  0$.\n\nFor this interval, the instantaneous semiconductor power products are:\n- For switch $S$: $p_S(t) = v_S(t)\\,i_S(t) = 0 \\cdot i_L(t) = 0$.\n- For diode $D$: $p_D(t) = v_D(t)\\,i_D(t) = (-V_{\\text{dc}}) \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n\n**Interval 2: $DT_s  t \\leq T_s$ (Switch $S$ is OFF)**\n\nWhen the main switch $S$ is OFF ($u(t)=0$), it behaves as an ideal open switch. By definition, an ideal open switch conducts zero current.\n$$i_S(t) = 0$$\nThe inductor current $i_L(t)  0$ must continue to flow. Since the path through switch $S$ is blocked, the current freewheels through the diode $D$. Applying KCL at node $a$:\n$$0 + i_D(t) = i_L(t) \\implies i_D(t) = i_L(t)$$\nSince $i_L(t)  0$, the diode must be conducting a positive current, $i_D(t)  0$. An ideal diode conducting a positive current must be forward-biased and has zero voltage drop across it.\n$$v_D(t) = 0$$\nFrom the definition of the diode voltage:\n$$v_D(t) = 0 - V_a(t) \\implies 0 = 0 - V_a(t) \\implies V_a(t) = 0$$\nThe switching node $a$ is at ground potential. The voltage across the switch $v_S(t)$ is defined as the source-side potential minus the potential at node $a$.\n$$v_S(t) = V_{\\text{dc}} - V_a(t) = V_{\\text{dc}} - 0 = V_{\\text{dc}}$$\nSince $V_{\\text{dc}}  0$, the switch is blocking a positive voltage.\n\nFor this interval, the instantaneous semiconductor power products are:\n- For switch $S$: $p_S(t) = v_S(t)\\,i_S(t) = V_{\\text{dc}} \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n- For diode $D$: $p_D(t) = v_D(t)\\,i_D(t) = 0 \\cdot i_L(t) = 0$.\n\nThe constructed piecewise waveforms satisfy the ideal switch complementarity condition $v(t)i(t)=0$ for both devices over the entire switching period.\n\n**Calculation of Average Power**\n\nThe total instantaneous power dissipated in the semiconductors is the sum of the power dissipated in the switch and the diode:\n$$p_{\\Sigma}(t) = v_S(t)\\,i_S(t) + v_D(t)\\,i_D(t)$$\nFrom the analysis of both intervals, we have shown that $v_S(t)i_S(t) = 0$ for all $t$ and $v_D(t)i_D(t) = 0$ for all $t$. Therefore, the total instantaneous power dissipation is identically zero for the entire period.\n$$p_{\\Sigma}(t) = 0 + 0 = 0 \\quad \\text{for } t \\in [0, T_s]$$\nThe time-average of the total instantaneous semiconductor power, $\\bar{p}_{\\Sigma}$, is given by the integral of $p_{\\Sigma}(t)$ over one period, divided by the period duration.\n$$\\bar{p}_{\\Sigma} = \\frac{1}{T_s}\\int_{0}^{T_s} p_{\\Sigma}(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t = \\frac{1}{T_s}\\int_{0}^{T_s} 0\\,\\mathrm{d}t$$\nThe integral of zero is zero.\n$$\\bar{p}_{\\Sigma} = \\frac{1}{T_s} \\cdot 0 = 0$$\nThe total average power dissipated by the ideal semiconductor devices is $0$ watts. This result is a direct consequence of the definition of ideal switches, which are lossless components. An ideal switch has either zero voltage across it (ON state) or zero current through it (OFF state), ensuring that the instantaneous power $v(t)i(t)$ is always zero.",

The analysis involves standard circuit theory and component models. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** All necessary parameters and constraints for a unique design solution are provided. The optimization objective (minimizing $f_{s}$) is clearly stated. The problem is well-posed.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, standard terminology from electrical engineering. It is free from subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe design of the ideal buck converter requires determining the duty cycle, and then using the ripple specifications to establish constraints on the switching frequency $f_{s}$ as a function of the inductance $L$ and capacitance $C$.\n\nFirst, for an ideal buck converter, the steady-state voltage transfer ratio is given by the duty cycle $D$:\n$$V_{o} = D V_{g}$$\nSolving for $D$:\n$$D = \\frac{V_{o}}{V_{g}} = \\frac{48}{400} = 0.12$$\n\nThe problem requires operation in continuous conduction mode (CCM). The condition for CCM is that the average inductor current $I_{L}$ is greater than half the peak-to-peak ripple current $\\Delta i_{L}$. For an ideal buck converter, $I_{L}$ equals the load current $I_{o}$.\n$$I_{L}  \\frac{\\Delta i_{L}}{2}$$\n$$I_{o}  \\frac{\\Delta i_{L}}{2} \\implies 20\\ \\mathrm{A}  \\frac{\\Delta i_{L}}{2} \\implies \\Delta i_{L}  40\\ \\mathrm{A}$$\nThe design constraint is $\\Delta i_{L} \\leq \\Delta i_{L,\\max} = 0.40\\ \\mathrm{A}$. Since $0.40\\ \\mathrm{A}  40\\ \\mathrm{A}$, the CCM condition will be satisfied if the ripple constraint is met.\n\nNext, we establish two constraints on the switching frequency $f_s$ based on the ripple requirements.\n\n**1. Inductor Current Ripple Constraint:**\nDuring the switch ON-time, interval $DT_{s}$, where $T_{s} = 1/f_{s}$, the voltage across the inductor is $v_{L} = V_{g} - V_{o}$. The change in inductor current (the peak-to-peak ripple) is:\n$$\\Delta i_{L} = \\frac{V_{g} - V_{o}}{L} D T_{s} = \\frac{(V_{g} - V_{o}) D}{L f_{s}}$$\nThe design requires $\\Delta i_{L} \\leq \\Delta i_{L,\\max}$. This leads to the first inequality for $f_s$:\n$$\\frac{(V_{g} - V_{o}) D}{L f_{s}} \\leq \\Delta i_{L,\\max}$$\n$$f_{s} \\geq \\frac{(V_{g} - V_{o}) D}{L \\Delta i_{L,\\max}}$$\nLet's call the term on the right $f_{s,1}(L)$. Substituting the given values:\n$$f_{s} \\geq \\frac{(400 - 48) \\times 0.12}{L \\times 0.40} = \\frac{352 \\times 0.12}{L \\times 0.40} = \\frac{42.24}{0.40 L} = \\frac{105.6}{L}$$\nSo, our first constraint is $f_{s} \\geq \\frac{105.6}{L}$.\n\n**2. Output Voltage Ripple Constraint:**\nFor an ideal capacitor (zero ESR), the voltage ripple $\\Delta v_{o}$ is caused by the charging and discharging action of the AC component of the inductor current. The change in charge $\\Delta Q$ on the capacitor that produces the peak-to-peak voltage ripple is the area of the inductor current waveform above the DC average $I_{o}$. This area is that of a triangle with a base of $T_{s}/2$ and a height of $\\Delta i_{L}/2$.\n$$\\Delta Q = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{T_{s}}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\Delta i_{L}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{T_{s} \\Delta i_{L}}{8} = \\frac{\\Delta i_{L}}{8 f_{s}}$$\nThe voltage ripple is then $\\Delta v_{o} = \\Delta Q / C$:\n$$\\Delta v_{o} = \\frac{\\Delta i_{L}}{8 C f_{s}}$$\nThis equation links the voltage ripple to the actual current ripple $\\Delta i_L$. We can substitute the expression for $\\Delta i_L$ from the inductor analysis:\n$$\\Delta v_{o} = \\frac{1}{8 C f_{s}} \\left( \\frac{(V_{g} - V_{o}) D}{L f_{s}} \\right) = \\frac{(V_{g} - V_{o}) D}{8 L C f_{s}^{2}}$$\nThe design requires $\\Delta v_{o} \\leq \\Delta v_{o,\\max}$. This gives the second inequality for $f_s$:\n$$\\frac{(V_{g} - V_{o}) D}{8 L C f_{s}^{2}} \\leq \\Delta v_{o,\\max}$$\n$$f_{s}^{2} \\geq \\frac{(V_{g} - V_{o}) D}{8 L C \\Delta v_{o,\\max}}$$\n$$f_{s} \\geq \\sqrt{\\frac{(V_{g} - V_{o}) D}{8 L C \\Delta v_{o,\\max}}}$$\nLet's call the term on the right $f_{s,2}(L,C)$. Substituting the given values:\n$$f_{s} \\geq \\sqrt{\\frac{(400 - 48) \\times 0.12}{8 \\times L \\times C \\times 0.10}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{42.24}{0.8 L C}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{52.8}{LC}}$$\nSo, our second constraint is $f_{s} \\geq \\sqrt{\\frac{52.8}{LC}}$.\n\n**Minimizing the Switching Frequency:**\nThe switching frequency $f_{s}$ must satisfy both constraints simultaneously:\n$$f_{s} \\geq \\max\\left(\\frac{105.6}{L}, \\sqrt{\\frac{52.8}{LC}}\\right)$$\nThe objective is to minimize $f_{s}$ by choosing $L$ and $C$ subject to $L \\leq L_{\\max} = 200\\ \\mathrm{\\mu H}$ and $C \\leq C_{\\max} = 10\\ \\mathrm{\\mu F}$.\nThe expression to be minimized, $\\max\\left(\\frac{105.6}{L}, \\sqrt{\\frac{52.8}{LC}}\\right)$, is a monotonically decreasing function of both $L$ and $C$. To obtain the minimum possible value for this expression, we must select the largest possible values for $L$ and $C$ from their allowed ranges.\nTherefore, we choose:\n$$L = L_{\\max} = 200\\ \\mathrm{\\mu H} = 200 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{H}$$\n$$C = C_{\\max} = 10\\ \\mathrm{\\mu F} = 10 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{F}$$\n\nNow, we calculate the minimum frequency imposed by each constraint using these values.\nFrom the current ripple constraint:\n$$f_{s} \\geq \\frac{105.6}{200 \\times 10^{-6}} = 528000\\ \\mathrm{Hz} = 528\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$$\nFrom the voltage ripple constraint:\n$$f_{s} \\geq \\sqrt{\\frac{52.8}{(200 \\times 10^{-6})(10 \\times 10^{-6})}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{52.8}{2 \\times 10^{-9}}} = \\sqrt{2.64 \\times 10^{10}}\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$$\n$$f_{s} \\geq 162480.77\\ \\mathrm{Hz} \\approx 162.5\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$$\nTo satisfy both conditions, $f_{s}$ must be greater than or equal to the maximum of these two lower bounds:\n$$f_{s,\\min} = \\max(528\\ \\mathrm{kHz}, 162.5\\ \\mathrm{kHz}) = 528\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$$\n\nThe minimum required switching frequency is $528\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$, which is determined by the inductor current ripple constraint being the more restrictive one.\n\nThe final values, rounded to four significant figures as requested, are:\n- $L = 200.0\\ \\mathrm{\\mu H}$\n- $C = 10.00\\ \\mathrm{\\mu F}$\n- $f_{s,\\min} = 528.0\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$",
