            "problem": "A direct current step-down (buck) converter is supplied by an ideal direct current source of magnitude $V_{\\text{dc}} > 0$. The converter comprises an ideal controlled main switch $S$, an ideal freewheel diode $D$, an ideal inductor $L$, and an ideal output capacitor such that the inductor current $i_L(t)$ is strictly positive for all time in steady-state operation (Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM)). The switching node is denoted $a$. The diode is connected from ground to node $a$ with its anode at ground and its cathode at node $a$. The main switch $S$ is connected between the source and node $a$.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it describes a standard, albeit idealized, scenario in power electronics that is scientifically grounded and well-posed. The objective is to compute the average power dissipated in the semiconductor devices of an ideal buck converter. This will be accomplished by analyzing the circuit's operation over one switching period and applying the definitions of ideal components.\n\nThe analysis is performed over a single switching period of duration $T_s$. The period is divided into two intervals based on the state of the main switch $S$, which is controlled by the gating function $u(t)$. Let $D$ be the duty cycle, such that the switch $S$ is on for $t \\in (0, DT_s]$ and off for $t \\in (DT_s, T_s]$.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between currents at the switching node $a$. Let the inductor current $i_L(t)$ be defined as positive flowing from node $a$ to the output. The current from the source through the switch, $i_S(t)$, flows into node $a$. The current through the diode, $i_D(t)$, is defined as positive flowing from ground to node $a$, so it also flows into node $a$. Applying Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at node $a$:\n$$i_S(t) + i_D(t) = i_L(t)$$\n\nNow, we analyze the circuit in each of the two switching intervals.\n\n**Interval 1: $0 < t \\leq DT_s$ (Switch $S$ is ON)**\n\nWhen the main switch $S$ is ON ($u(t)=1$), it behaves as an ideal closed switch. By definition, an ideal closed switch has zero voltage drop across it.\n$$v_S(t) = 0$$\nThe switch connects the DC source of voltage $V_{\\text{dc}}$ directly to the switching node $a$. Therefore, the potential at node $a$, denoted $V_a(t)$, is equal to the source voltage.\n$$V_a(t) = V_{\\text{dc}}$$\nThe voltage across the diode $v_D(t)$ is defined as the anode potential (ground, $0$) minus the cathode potential (node $a$).\n$$v_D(t) = 0 - V_a(t) = -V_{\\text{dc}}$$\nSince the problem states $V_{\\text{dc}} > 0$, the voltage across the diode is negative, meaning the diode is reverse-biased. An ideal diode under reverse bias conducts zero current.\n$$i_D(t) = 0$$\nUsing the KCL equation at node $a$:\n$$i_S(t) + 0 = i_L(t) \\implies i_S(t) = i_L(t)$$\nThe problem specifies that the converter operates in Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM), meaning the inductor current is strictly positive for all time, $i_L(t) > 0$. Consequently, $i_S(t) > 0$.\n\nFor this interval, the instantaneous semiconductor power products are:\n- For switch $S$: $p_S(t) = v_S(t)\\,i_S(t) = 0 \\cdot i_L(t) = 0$.\n- For diode $D$: $p_D(t) = v_D(t)\\,i_D(t) = (-V_{\\text{dc}}) \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n\n**Interval 2: $DT_s < t \\leq T_s$ (Switch $S$ is OFF)**\n\nWhen the main switch $S$ is OFF ($u(t)=0$), it behaves as an ideal open switch. By definition, an ideal open switch conducts zero current.\n$$i_S(t) = 0$$\nThe inductor current $i_L(t) > 0$ must continue to flow. Since the path through switch $S$ is blocked, the current freewheels through the diode $D$. Applying KCL at node $a$:\n$$0 + i_D(t) = i_L(t) \\implies i_D(t) = i_L(t)$$\nSince $i_L(t) > 0$, the diode must be conducting a positive current, $i_D(t) > 0$. An ideal diode conducting a positive current must be forward-biased and has zero voltage drop across it.\n$$v_D(t) = 0$$\nFrom the definition of the diode voltage:\n$$v_D(t) = 0 - V_a(t) \\implies 0 = 0 - V_a(t) \\implies V_a(t) = 0$$\nThe switching node $a$ is at ground potential. The voltage across the switch $v_S(t)$ is defined as the source-side potential minus the potential at node $a$.\n$$v_S(t) = V_{\\text{dc}} - V_a(t) = V_{\\text{dc}} - 0 = V_{\\text{dc}}$$\nSince $V_{\\text{dc}} > 0$, the switch is blocking a positive voltage.\n\nFor this interval, the instantaneous semiconductor power products are:\n- For switch $S$: $p_S(t) = v_S(t)\\,i_S(t) = V_{\\text{dc}} \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n- For diode $D$: $p_D(t) = v_D(t)\\,i_D(t) = 0 \\cdot i_L(t) = 0$.\n\nThe constructed piecewise waveforms satisfy the ideal switch complementarity condition $v(t)i(t)=0$ for both devices over the entire switching period.\n\n**Calculation of Average Power**\n\nThe total instantaneous power dissipated in the semiconductors is the sum of the power dissipated in the switch and the diode:\n$$p_{\\Sigma}(t) = v_S(t)\\,i_S(t) + v_D(t)\\,i_D(t)$$\nFrom the analysis of both intervals, we have shown that $v_S(t)i_S(t) = 0$ for all $t$ and $v_D(t)i_D(t) = 0$ for all $t$. Therefore, the total instantaneous power dissipation is identically zero for the entire period.\n$$p_{\\Sigma}(t) = 0 + 0 = 0 \\quad \\text{for } t \\in [0, T_s]$$\nThe time-average of the total instantaneous semiconductor power, $\\bar{p}_{\\Sigma}$, is given by the integral of $p_{\\Sigma}(t)$ over one period, divided by the period duration.\n$$\\bar{p}_{\\Sigma} = \\frac{1}{T_s}\\int_{0}^{T_s} p_{\\Sigma}(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t = \\frac{1}{T_s}\\int_{0}^{T_s} 0\\,\\mathrm{d}t$$\nThe integral of zero is zero.\n$$\\bar{p}_{\\Sigma} = \\frac{1}{T_s} \\cdot 0 = 0$$\nThe total average power dissipated by the ideal semiconductor devices is $0$ watts. This result is a direct consequence of the definition of ideal switches, which are lossless components. An ideal switch has either zero voltage across it (ON state) or zero current through it (OFF state), ensuring that the instantaneous power $v(t)i(t)$ is always zero.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of circuit theory and power electronics, using the standard and well-defined model of an ideal full-bridge inverter. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary components, connections, and control logic specified. The givens are self-consistent and sufficient to derive a unique solution. The analysis will proceed based on the provided ideal device models and Kirchhoff's laws.\n\n**(a) Derivation of the line-to-line output voltage $v_{ab}(t)$**\n\nThe full-bridge inverter consists of two legs. Leg A comprises switches $S_1$ and $S_2$ and connects the output node $a$ to the DC bus rails. Leg B comprises switches $S_3$ and $S_4$ and connects the output node $b$ to the DC bus rails. The DC bus has a total voltage of $V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$, with rails at voltages $+V_{\\mathrm{dc}}/2$ and $-V_{\\mathrm{dc}}/2$ with respect to a defined midpoint ground.\n\nThe output voltage is defined as $v_{ab}(t) = v_a(t) - v_b(t)$, where $v_a(t)$ and $v_b(t)$ are the potentials of nodes $a$ and $b$ with respect to the DC bus midpoint.\n\nThe control scheme is bipolar Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), where the gating signals for the four switches are determined by comparing a sinusoidal modulating signal $m(t)$ with a triangular carrier signal $c(t)$. The comparator logic dictates the state of the inverter:\n\n1.  **Case 1: $m(t) > c(t)$**\n    According to the problem statement, the diagonal pair $\\{S_1, S_4\\}$ is gated ON, and the complementary pair $\\{S_2, S_3\\}$ is gated OFF.\n    -   Since $S_1$ is an ideal switch in the ON state, it creates a perfect short circuit. Thus, node $a$ is connected directly to the positive DC rail. Its potential is $v_a(t) = +\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{2}$.\n    -   Similarly, since $S_4$ is an ideal switch in the ON state, node $b$ is connected directly to the negative DC rail. Its potential is $v_b(t) = -\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{2}$.\n    -   The resulting line-to-line output voltage is:\n        $$v_{ab}(t) = v_a(t) - v_b(t) = \\left(+\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{2}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{2}\\right) = V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$$\n    This holds regardless of the direction of the load current $i(t)$, as either the switch itself or its antiparallel diode will conduct to clamp the node to the rail voltage.\n\n2.  **Case 2: $m(t) < c(t)$**\n    In this case, the diagonal pair $\\{S_2, S_3\\}$ is gated ON, and the complementary pair $\\{S_1, S_4\\}$ is gated OFF.\n    -   With $S_2$ ON, node $a$ is connected directly to the negative DC rail. Its potential is $v_a(t) = -\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{2}$.\n    -   With $S_3$ ON, node $b$ is connected directly to the positive DC rail. Its potential is $v_b(t) = +\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{2}$.\n    -   The resulting line-to-line output voltage is:\n        $$v_{ab}(t) = v_a(t) - v_b(t) = \\left(-\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{2}\\right) - \\left(+\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{2}\\right) = -V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$$\n\nTo combine these two conditions into a single closed-form expression, we can use the sign function, $\\mathrm{sgn}(x)$, which is defined as $+1$ for $x > 0$ and $-1$ for $x < 0$. We observe that the output voltage is $+V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$ when $m(t) - c(t) > 0$ and $-V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$ when $m(t) - c(t) < 0$. Therefore, we can write the output voltage as:\n$$v_{ab}(t) = V_{\\mathrm{dc}} \\cdot \\mathrm{sgn}(m(t) - c(t))$$\nAt the instants where $m(t)=c(t)$, the transition is assumed to be instantaneous, and the sign function evaluates to $0$. This represents the ideal zero-duration switching event.\n\n**(b) Verification of zero instantaneous power in each controlled switch**\n\nWe are asked to verify that the instantaneous power $p_k(t) = v_k(t) i_k(t)$ is identically zero for any controlled switch $S_k$, where $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. The terms $v_k(t)$ and $i_k(t)$ represent the voltage across and the current through the controllable switch element itself, distinct from its antiparallel diode.\n\nThe verification relies directly on the definition of an ideal controlled switch provided in the problem:\n-   In the **ON-state**, a switch has zero voltage drop ($v_k(t)=0$) while supporting any finite current.\n-   In the **OFF-state**, a switch has zero current ($i_k(t)=0$) while supporting any finite voltage.\n\nAt any instant in time $t$, any given controlled switch $S_k$ is either in the ON-state or the OFF-state, as determined by the PWM comparator logic. We examine both possibilities:\n\n1.  **If switch $S_k$ is in the ON-state (gated ON):**\n    By definition of an ideal switch, the voltage across it is zero: $v_k(t) = 0$. The current $i_k(t)$ may be non-zero (if the load current direction is appropriate for the switch to conduct). However, the instantaneous power is:\n    $$p_k(t) = v_k(t) i_k(t) = (0) \\cdot i_k(t) = 0$$\n\n2.  **If switch $S_k$ is in the OFF-state (gated OFF):**\n    By definition of an ideal switch, the current flowing through it is zero: $i_k(t) = 0$. The switch must block a non-zero voltage (typically $V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$ in this topology). However, the instantaneous power is:\n    $$p_k(t) = v_k(t) i_k(t) = v_k(t) \\cdot (0) = 0$$\n\nSince at any time $t$, every switch $S_k$ must be in either the ON-state or the OFF-state, its instantaneous power dissipation $p_k(t)$ is identically zero for all $t$. This conclusion holds for arbitrary load current $i(t)$, including both positive and negative values, because the combination of the unidirectional controlled switches and the ideal antiparallel diodes ensures that a current path always exists. If the commanded ON switch cannot carry the current due to its directionality, its associated antiparallel diode (or the diode of a complementary switch in the same leg) will conduct, but the current through the controlled switch element itself, $i_k(t)$, will be zero, upholding the condition for zero power.\n\nTherefore, the instantaneous power in any of the four controlled switches is identically zero for all time. The final value is $p_k(t) = 0$ for any $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.",

Inductor Current Ripple Constraint:**\nDuring the switch ON-time, interval $DT_{s}$, where $T_{s} = 1/f_{s}$, the voltage across the inductor is $v_{L} = V_{g} - V_{o}$. The change in inductor current (the peak-to-peak ripple) is:\n$$\\Delta i_{L} = \\frac{V_{g} - V_{o}}{L} D T_{s} = \\frac{(V_{g} - V_{o}) D}{L f_{s}}$$\nThe design requires $\\Delta i_{L} \\leq \\Delta i_{L,\\max}$.

Output Voltage Ripple Constraint:**\nFor an ideal capacitor (zero ESR), the voltage ripple $\\Delta v_{o}$ is caused by the charging and discharging action of the AC component of the inductor current. The change in charge $\\Delta Q$ on the capacitor that produces the peak-to-peak voltage ripple is the area of the inductor current waveform above the DC average $I_{o}$. This area is that of a triangle with a base of $T_{s}/2$ and a height of $\\Delta i_{L}/2$.\n$$\\Delta Q = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{T_{s}}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\Delta i_{L}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{T_{s} \\Delta i_{L}}{8} = \\frac{\\Delta i_{L}}{8 f_{s}}$$\nThe voltage ripple is then $\\Delta v_{o} = \\Delta Q / C$:\n$$\\Delta v_{o} = \\frac{\\Delta i_{L}}{8 C f_{s}}$$\nThis equation links the voltage ripple to the actual current ripple $\\Delta i_L$. We can substitute the expression for $\\Delta i_L$ from the inductor analysis:\n$$\\Delta v_{o} = \\frac{1}{8 C f_{s}} \\left( \\frac{(V_{g} - V_{o}) D}{L f_{s}} \\right) = \\frac{(V_{g} - V_{o}) D}{8 L C f_{s}^{2}}$$\nThe design requires $\\Delta v_{o} \\leq \\Delta v_{o,\\max}$. This gives the second inequality for $f_s$:\n$$\\frac{(V_{g} - V_{o}) D}{8 L C f_{s}^{2}} \\leq \\Delta v_{o,\\max}$$\n$$f_{s}^{2} \\geq \\frac{(V_{g} - V_{o}) D}{8 L C \\Delta v_{o,\\max}}$$\n$$f_{s} \\geq \\sqrt{\\frac{(V_{g} - V_{o}) D}{8 L C \\Delta v_{o,\\max}}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$f_{s} \\geq \\sqrt{\\frac{(400 - 48) \\times 0.12}{8 \\times L \\times C \\times 0.10}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{42.24}{0.8 L C}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{52.8}{LC}}$$\nSo, our second constraint is $f_{s} \\geq \\sqrt{\\frac{52.8}{LC}}$.\n\n**Minimizing the Switching Frequency:**\nThe switching frequency $f_{s}$ must satisfy both constraints simultaneously:\n$$f_{s} \\geq \\max\\left(\\frac{105.6}{L}, \\sqrt{\\frac{52.8}{LC}}\\right)$$\nThe objective is to minimize $f_{s}$ by choosing $L$ and $C$ subject to $L \\leq L_{\\max} = 200\\ \\mathrm{\\mu H}$ and $C \\leq C_{\\max} = 10\\ \\mathrm{\\mu F}$.\nThe expression to be minimized, $\\max\\left(\\frac{105.6}{L}, \\sqrt{\\frac{52.8}{LC}}\\right)$, is a monotonically decreasing function of both $L$ and $C$. To obtain the minimum possible value for this expression, we must select the largest possible values for $L$ and $C$ from their allowed ranges.\nTherefore, we choose:\n$$L = L_{\\max} = 200\\ \\mathrm{\\mu H} = 200 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{H}$$\n$$C = C_{\\max} = 10\\ \\mathrm{\\mu F} = 10 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{F}$$\n\nNow, we calculate the minimum frequency imposed by each constraint using these values.\nFrom the current ripple constraint:\n$$f_{s} \\geq \\frac{105.6}{200 \\times 10^{-6}} = 528000\\ \\mathrm{Hz} = 528\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$$\nFrom the voltage ripple constraint:\n$$f_{s} \\geq \\sqrt{\\frac{52.8}{(200 \\times 10^{-6})(10 \\times 10^{-6})}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{52.8}{2 \\times 10^{-9}}} = \\sqrt{2.64 \\times 10^{10}}\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$$\n$$f_{s} \\geq 162480.77\\ \\mathrm{Hz} \\approx 162.5\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$$\nTo satisfy both conditions, $f_{s}$ must be greater than or equal to the maximum of these two lower bounds:\n$$f_{s,\\min} = \\max(528\\ \\mathrm{kHz}, 162.5\\ \\mathrm{kHz}) = 528\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$$\n\nThe minimum required switching frequency is $528\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$, which is determined by the inductor current ripple constraint being the more restrictive one.\n\nThe final values, rounded to four significant figures as requested, are:\n- $L = 200.0\\ \\mathrm{\\mu H}$\n- $C = 10.00\\ \\mathrm{\\mu F}$\n- $f_{s,\\min} = 528.0\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$",
