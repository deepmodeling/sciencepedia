            "problem": "Consider a reverse-biased, one-sided abrupt $p^{+}$–$n$ junction used as the blocking junction of a power diode.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the breakdown voltage for a one-sided abrupt $p^{+}$–$n$ junction and its subsequent calculation for Silicon (Si) and Silicon Carbide (SiC), followed by the ratio of the two breakdown voltages.\n\nFirst, we perform the derivation starting from the one-dimensional Poisson's equation. The problem considers a $p^{+}$–$n$ junction, where the depletion region extends almost exclusively into the lightly doped $n$-type side. Let the metallurgical junction be at the position $x=0$. The depletion region on the $n$-side extends from $x=0$ to $x=W_n$. According to the depletion approximation, the space charge density $\\rho(x)$ in this region is due to the ionized donor atoms:\n$$ \\rho(x) = q N_D \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\le x \\le W_n $$\nwhere $q$ is the elementary charge and $N_D$ is the uniform donor concentration. For $x > W_n$, the region is neutral, so $\\rho(x) = 0$.\n\nPoisson's equation relates the electric field $E$ to the space charge density:\n$$ \\frac{dE}{dx} = \\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\varepsilon} $$\nwhere $\\varepsilon$ is the permittivity of the semiconductor material ($\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0$). Substituting the charge density, we get for the depletion region:\n$$ \\frac{dE}{dx} = \\frac{q N_D}{\\varepsilon} $$\nTo find the electric field profile $E(x)$, we integrate this equation from a point $x$ in the depletion region to its edge at $x=W_n$. The boundary condition is that the electric field vanishes at the edge of the depletion region, i.e., $E(W_n)=0$.\n$$ \\int_{E(x)}^{E(W_n)} dE' = \\int_{x}^{W_n} \\frac{q N_D}{\\varepsilon} dx' $$\n$$ E(W_n) - E(x) = \\frac{q N_D}{\\varepsilon} (W_n - x) $$\nWith $E(W_n)=0$, the electric field is:\n$$ E(x) = -\\frac{q N_D}{\\varepsilon} (W_n - x) $$\nThe electric field is a linear function of position. Its magnitude is maximum at the metallurgical junction ($x=0$):\n$$ E_{max} = |E(0)| = \\frac{q N_D W_n}{\\varepsilon} $$\n\nNext, we find the potential drop across the depletion region by integrating the electric field, since $E = -dV/dx$. The potential difference across the depletion region, $V_j$, is:\n$$ V_j = -\\int_{0}^{W_n} E(x) dx = -\\int_{0}^{W_n} \\left[-\\frac{q N_D}{\\varepsilon} (W_n - x)\\right] dx $$\n$$ V_j = \\frac{q N_D}{\\varepsilon} \\left[ W_n x - \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right]_0^{W_n} = \\frac{q N_D}{\\varepsilon} \\left( W_n^2 - \\frac{W_n^2}{2} \\right) = \\frac{q N_D W_n^2}{2 \\varepsilon} $$\nThis potential drop $V_j$ is the sum of the applied reverse bias $V_R$ and the built-in potential $V_{bi}$. The problem states that we can neglect the built-in potential relative to the breakdown voltage, so at breakdown, $V_j \\approx V_R = V_{BD}$.\n\nAt the point of avalanche breakdown, the maximum electric field reaches the critical field, $E_{max} = E_{crit}$, and the applied voltage is the breakdown voltage, $V_{BD}$. The depletion width at this point is $W_{BD}$. We have a system of two equations:\n1. $E_{crit} = \\frac{q N_D W_{BD}}{\\varepsilon}$\n2. $V_{BD} = \\frac{q N_D W_{BD}^2}{2 \\varepsilon}$\n\nFrom equation (1), we solve for the depletion width at breakdown, $W_{BD}$:\n$$ W_{BD} = \\frac{\\varepsilon E_{crit}}{q N_D} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $W_{BD}$ into equation (2) gives the breakdown voltage $V_{BD}$:\n$$ V_{BD} = \\frac{q N_D}{2 \\varepsilon} \\left( \\frac{\\varepsilon E_{crit}}{q N_D} \\right)^2 = \\frac{q N_D}{2 \\varepsilon} \\frac{\\varepsilon^2 E_{crit}^2}{q^2 N_D^2} $$\n$$ V_{BD} = \\frac{\\varepsilon E_{crit}^2}{2 q N_D} $$\nThis is the derived expression for the breakdown voltage of a non-punch-through, one-sided abrupt junction.\n\nNow, we evaluate the breakdown voltages for Si and SiC using the provided parameters. The problem states that the drift layer thickness $t = 200\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ is large enough to prevent reach-through.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of the minority-carrier lifetime and diffusion length in a p-type silicon region, followed by an assessment of the potential for conductivity modulation. The solution proceeds by applying the Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination theory under specified simplifying assumptions.\n\nThe net recombination rate $U$ due to a single-level trap is described by the SRH model:\n$$ U = \\frac{n p - n_{i}^{2}}{\\tau_{p0}(n+n_{1}) + \\tau_{n0}(p+p_{1})} $$\nwhere $n$ and $p$ are the total electron and hole concentrations, respectively, and $n_{i}$ is the intrinsic carrier concentration.

The terms $n_{1}$ and $p_{1}$ are carrier concentrations corresponding to the case where the Fermi level equals the trap energy level $E_{t}$:\n$$ n_{1} = n_{i} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{t} - E_{i}}{k_{B}T}\\right) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad p_{1} = n_{i} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{i} - E_{t}}{k_{B}T}\\right) $$\nwhere $E_{i}$ is the intrinsic Fermi level, $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe problem states that the traps are located at midgap, which means $E_{t} = E_{i}$. This simplifies the expressions for $n_{1}$ and $p_{1}$ to $n_{1} = p_{1} = n_{i}$.\n\nThe material is a p-type semiconductor with an acceptor concentration $N_{A} = 5.0 \\times 10^{15}~\\text{cm}^{-3}$. Assuming full ionization, the equilibrium majority carrier (hole) concentration is $p_{0} \\approx N_{A}$. The equilibrium minority carrier (electron) concentration, from the law of mass action ($n_{0}p_{0} = n_{i}^{2}$), is $n_{0} = n_{i}^{2}/p_{0}$. Given $N_{A} \\gg n_{i}$, it is confirmed that $p_{0} \\gg n_{i} \\gg n_{0}$.\n\nThe analysis is performed under low-level injection (LLI), where the excess carrier concentration, $\\delta n$, is much smaller than the majority carrier concentration, i.e., $\\delta n \\ll p_{0}$. The total carrier concentrations are $n = n_{0} + \\delta n$ and $p = p_{0} + \\delta p$. Invoking charge neutrality, $\\delta n = \\delta p$, so $p = p_{0} + \\delta n \\approx p_{0}$.\n\nThe net recombination rate can be defined in terms of the excess minority carrier concentration as $U = \\frac{\\delta n}{\\tau_{n}}$, where $\\tau_{n}$ is the effective minority carrier lifetime. In a p-type material under LLI, the lifetime for excess minority carriers (electrons) simplifies significantly to $\\tau_n \\approx \\tau_{n0}$. This is because recombination is limited by the capture of electrons at trap sites.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $\\tau_{n}$:\n$$ \\tau_{n} \\approx \\tau_{n0} = \\frac{1}{N_{t} \\sigma_{n} v_{\\text{th}}} = \\frac{1}{(1.0 \\times 10^{13}~\\text{cm}^{-3})(2.0 \\times 10^{-15}~\\text{cm}^{2})(1.0 \\times 10^{7}~\\text{cm/s})} $$\n$$ \\tau_{n} = \\frac{1}{2.0 \\times 10^{5}~\\text{s}^{-1}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-6}~\\text{s} $$\n\nNext, we determine the minority-carrier diffusion coefficient, $D_{n}$, using the Einstein relation:\n$$ D_{n} = \\mu_{n} \\frac{k_{B}T}{q} $$\nThe thermal voltage at $T = 300~\\text{K}$ is:\n$$ \\frac{k_{B}T}{q} = \\frac{(1.381 \\times 10^{-23}~\\text{J/K})(300~\\text{K})}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19}~\\text{C}} \\approx 0.02586~\\text{V} $$\nUsing the given electron mobility $\\mu_{n} = 1350~\\text{cm}^{2}/\\text{V}\\cdot\\text{s}$:\n$$ D_{n} = (1350~\\text{cm}^{2}/\\text{V}\\cdot\\text{s})(0.02586~\\text{V}) \\approx 34.91~\\text{cm}^{2}/\\text{s} $$\n\nThe minority-carrier diffusion length, $L_{n}$, is related to the diffusion coefficient and lifetime by:\n$$ L_{n} = \\sqrt{D_{n} \\tau_{n}} $$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$ L_{n} = \\sqrt{(34.91~\\text{cm}^{2}/\\text{s})(5.0 \\times 10^{-6}~\\text{s})} = \\sqrt{1.7455 \\times 10^{-4}~\\text{cm}^2} \\approx 0.01321~\\text{cm} $$\nTo express this result in micrometers and round to three significant figures, we use the conversion $1~\\text{cm} = 10^{4}~\\mu\\text{m}$:\n$$ L_{n} \\approx (0.01321) \\times 10^{4}~\\mu\\text{m} \\approx 132.1~\\mu\\text{m} $$\n$$ L_{n} \\approx 132~\\mu\\text{m} $$\n\nFinally, we assess whether significant conductivity modulation is expected. The base thickness is given as $w = 100~\\mu\\text{m}$. We compare this to the calculated minority-carrier diffusion length, $L_{n} = 132~\\mu\\text{m}$. We find that $L_{n} > w$.\nConductivity modulation is the increase in a semiconductor region's conductivity due to an injected population of excess electron-hole pairs. For this effect to be significant, the injected carrier lifetime must be long enough to allow a substantial population to build up throughout the region. The ratio of the diffusion length to the region's width is a key figure of merit. Since the diffusion length $L_{n}$ is greater than the base thickness $w$, injected minority carriers (electrons) can, on average, diffuse across the entire base region before they recombine. This condition enables a high concentration of stored charge to accumulate in the base under forward bias, which drastically increases its conductivity. Therefore, significant conductivity modulation is expected in this device structure, which is a desirable characteristic for reducing on-state losses in a power diode.",
