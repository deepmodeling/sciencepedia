A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Time-Domain Response $v_{C}(t)$**\n\nThe analysis is divided into two time intervals dictated by the behavior of the input voltage source $v_{\\text{in}}(t)$.\n\n**Interval 1: $0 \\le t  w$ (Charging Phase)**\n\nDuring this interval, the input voltage is a constant, $v_{\\text{in}}(t) = V_{p}$. The circuit consists of the voltage source $V_{p}$ in series with the resistor $R$ and capacitor $C$. We apply Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL) to the single loop:\n$$v_{\\text{in}}(t) = v_{R}(t) + v_{C}(t)$$\nwhere $v_{R}(t)$ is the voltage across the resistor and $v_{C}(t)$ is the voltage across the capacitor. For this interval, this becomes:\n$$V_{p} = v_{R}(t) + v_{C}(t)$$\nThe current $i(t)$ flowing through the series circuit is given by Ohm's law for the resistor, $v_{R}(t) = R \\, i(t)$. This same current flows through the capacitor, so $i(t) = i_{C}(t)$. Using the capacitor's constitutive relation provided, $i_{C}(t) = C \\, \\frac{d v_{C}(t)}{d t}$, we can write the current as:\n$$i(t) = C \\, \\frac{d v_{C}(t)}{d t}$$\nSubstituting $v_{R}(t) = R \\, C \\, \\frac{d v_{C}(t)}{d t}$ into the KVL equation yields the governing first-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $v_{C}(t)$:\n$$V_{p} = R C \\, \\frac{d v_{C}(t)}{d t} + v_{C}(t)$$\nUsing the definition of the time constant, $\\tau = R C$, the ODE is:\n$$\\tau \\, \\frac{d v_{C}(t)}{d t} + v_{C}(t) = V_{p}$$\nThe solution to this ODE is the sum of a particular solution ($v_{C,p}(t)$) and a homogeneous solution ($v_{C,h}(t)$). The particular solution corresponds to the steady-state response. As $t \\rightarrow \\infty$ (if the source were to remain on), the capacitor would be fully charged, acting as an open circuit, so $i(t \\rightarrow \\infty) = 0$ and $v_{C}(t \\rightarrow \\infty) = V_{p}$. Thus, the particular solution is $v_{C,p}(t) = V_{p}$. The homogeneous equation is $\\tau \\, \\frac{d v_{C,h}(t)}{d t} + v_{C,h}(t) = 0$, which has the solution $v_{C,h}(t) = A \\exp(-t/\\tau)$ for some constant $A$.\nThe complete solution is:\n$$v_{C}(t) = v_{C,p}(t) + v_{C,h}(t) = V_{p} + A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)$$\nThe constant $A$ is determined from the initial condition. The voltage across a capacitor cannot change instantaneously, so $v_{C}(0^{+}) = v_{C}(0^{-})$. The problem states $v_{C}(0^{-}) = 0$, so $v_{C}(0) = 0$. Applying this at $t=0$:\n$$v_{C}(0) = 0 = V_{p} + A \\exp(0) \\implies A = -V_{p}$$\nTherefore, the capacitor voltage for the first interval is:\n$$v_{C}(t) = V_{p} \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) \\right) \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\le t  w$$\n\n**Interval 2: $t \\ge w$ (Discharging Phase)**\n\nFor this interval, the input voltage $v_{\\text{in}}(t)$ becomes $0$. The circuit is now a source-free RC circuit. The KVL equation becomes:\n$$0 = v_{R}(t) + v_{C}(t)$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $v_R(t)$ and $i(t)$ as before, we get the homogeneous ODE:\n$$0 = R C \\, \\frac{d v_{C}(t)}{d t} + v_{C}(t) \\implies \\tau \\, \\frac{d v_{C}(t)}{d t} + v_{C}(t) = 0$$\nThe general solution is of the form:\n$$v_{C}(t) = B \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)$$\nTo find the constant $B$, we need the initial condition for this interval, which is the capacitor voltage at $t=w$. Again, due to the continuity of capacitor voltage, $v_{C}(w^{+}) = v_{C}(w^{-})$. We find $v_{C}(w^{-})$ by evaluating the solution from the first interval at $t=w$:\n$$v_{C}(w^{-}) = V_{p} \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{w}{\\tau}\\right) \\right)$$\nThis value is the residual capacitor voltage immediately after the pulse ends, $v_{C}(w^{+})$, which is the quantity requested for the final answer.\n$$v_{C}(w^{+}) = V_{p} \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{w}{\\tau}\\right) \\right)$$\nTo complete the derivation of $v_{C}(t)$ for $t \\ge w$, we apply this condition at $t=w$:\n$$v_{C}(w) = B \\exp\\left(-\\frac{w}{\\tau}\\right) = V_{p} \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{w}{\\tau}\\right) \\right)$$\nSolving for $B$:\n$$B = V_{p} \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{w}{\\tau}\\right) \\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{w}{\\tau}\\right) = V_{p} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{w}{\\tau}\\right) - 1 \\right)$$\nSubstituting $B$ back into the solution for $v_{C}(t)$:\n$$v_{C}(t) = V_{p} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{w}{\\tau}\\right) - 1 \\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) = V_{p} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{w-t}{\\tau}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) \\right) \\quad \\text{for } t \\ge w$$\nThis can also be expressed more intuitively by shifting the time origin to $t'=t-w$:\n$$v_{C}(t) = v_{C}(w^{+}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t-w}{\\tau}\\right) = V_{p} \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{w}{\\tau}\\right) \\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t-w}{\\tau}\\right) \\quad \\text{for } t \\ge w$$\nThe problem specifically asks for the expression for $v_{C}(w^{+})$. Based on the derivation above, this is the voltage at the boundary between the two intervals.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\n\nThe residual capacitor voltage immediately after the pulse ends, $v_{C}(w^{+})$, is equal to the voltage value $v_{C}(w^{-})$ at the end of the charging phase.\n$$v_{C}(w^{+}) = v_{C}(w^{-}) = V_{p} \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{w}{\\tau}\\right) \\right)$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytic expression in terms of the given parameters $V_{p}$, $w$, and $\\tau$.",

The given values are physically realistic for a modern SiC MOSFET-based power converter.\n\nThe unperturbed device-under-test (DUT) is modeled as a series RLC circuit with resistance $R$, inductance $L$, and capacitance $C_0$. The voltage ringing at the switching node corresponds to the transient response of this circuit. The behavior of a series RLC circuit is described by the second-order linear differential equation, whose characteristic equation in the Laplace domain is:\n$$s^2 + \\frac{R}{L}s + \\frac{1}{LC_0} = 0$$\nThis is of the standard form $s^2 + 2\\zeta_0 \\omega_{n,0} s + \\omega_{n,0}^2 = 0$, where $\\omega_{n,0}$ is the undamped natural frequency and $\\zeta_0$ is the damping ratio for the unperturbed circuit.\n$$ \\omega_{n,0} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{LC_0}} $$\n$$ \\zeta_0 = \\frac{R}{2L}\\frac{1}{\\omega_{n,0}} = \\frac{R}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{C_0}{L}} $$\nThe system is underdamped if $\\zeta_0  1$, which results in oscillations. The frequency of these oscillations is the damped natural frequency, $\\omega_{d,0}$:\n$$ \\omega_{d,0} = \\omega_{n,0} \\sqrt{1 - \\zeta_0^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{LC_0} - \\frac{R^2}{4L^2}} $$\nFirst, we compute the value of this unperturbed damped natural frequency using the given parameters: $L = 30~\\text{nH}$, $C_0 = 150~\\text{pF}$, and $R = 0.60~\\Omega$.\n$$ \\frac{1}{LC_0} = \\frac{1}{(30 \\times 10^{-9}~\\text{H})(150 \\times 10^{-12}~\\text{F})} = \\frac{1}{4.5 \\times 10^{-18}~\\text{s}^2} \\approx 2.222 \\times 10^{17}~\\text{rad}^2/\\text{s}^2 $$\n$$ \\frac{R^2}{4L^2} = \\frac{(0.60~\\Omega)^2}{4(30 \\times 10^{-9}~\\text{H})^2} = \\frac{0.36~\\Omega^2}{3.6 \\times 10^{-15}~\\text{H}^2} = 1.0 \\times 10^{14}~\\text{rad}^2/\\text{s}^2 $$\nThe damped natural frequency squared is:\n$$ \\omega_{d,0}^2 = \\frac{1}{LC_0} - \\frac{R^2}{4L^2} = 2.222... \\times 10^{17} - 1.0 \\times 10^{14} \\approx 2.2212 \\times 10^{17}~\\text{rad}^2/\\text{s}^2 $$\nThus, the angular frequency is:\n$$ \\omega_{d,0} = \\sqrt{2.2212 \\times 10^{17}} \\approx 4.71298 \\times 10^8~\\text{rad/s} $$\n\n**1. Derivation of Minimum Required Bandwidth ($B$)**\nThe measurement front-end is modeled as a first-order low-pass filter with a $-3~\\text{dB}$ bandwidth $B$. Its transfer function is $H(s) = \\frac{\\omega_B}{s + \\omega_B}$, where $\\omega_B = 2\\pi B$ is the angular bandwidth. The magnitude of the frequency response is:\n$$ |H(j\\omega)| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + (\\omega/\\omega_B)^2}} $$\nThe design target requires the measured amplitude at the ringing frequency $\\omega_{d,0}$ to be within $5\\%$ of the true amplitude. This means the gain of the filter at this frequency must be at least $95\\%$ of its DC gain (which is $1$). Let the maximum amplitude error be $\\epsilon_A = 0.05$. The condition is:\n$$ |H(j\\omega_{d,0})| \\ge 1 - \\epsilon_A $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + (\\omega_{d,0}/\\omega_B)^2}} \\ge 1 - \\epsilon_A $$\nTo find the minimum required bandwidth, we solve this inequality for $\\omega_B$:\n$$ 1 + \\left(\\frac{\\omega_{d,0}}{\\omega_B}\\right)^2 \\le \\frac{1}{(1 - \\epsilon_A)^2} $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\omega_{d,0}}{\\omega_B}\\right)^2 \\le \\frac{1}{(1 - \\epsilon_A)^2} - 1 $$\n$$ \\omega_B^2 \\ge \\frac{\\omega_{d,0}^2}{\\frac{1}{(1 - \\epsilon_A)^2} - 1} $$\n$$ \\omega_B \\ge \\frac{\\omega_{d,0}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{(1 - \\epsilon_A)^2} - 1}} $$\nThe minimum required bandwidth $B_{min}$ is therefore given by:\n$$ B_{min} = \\frac{\\omega_B}{2\\pi} = \\frac{\\omega_{d,0}}{2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{(1 - \\epsilon_A)^2} - 1}} $$\nUsing $\\epsilon_A = 0.05$ and the computed value of $\\omega_{d,0}$:\n$$ \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{(1 - 0.05)^2} - 1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{0.95^2} - 1} \\approx \\sqrt{1.10803 - 1} \\approx \\sqrt{0.10803} \\approx 0.32868 $$\n$$ B_{min} = \\frac{4.71298 \\times 10^8~\\text{rad/s}}{2\\pi \\times 0.32868} \\approx \\frac{4.71298 \\times 10^8}{2.0651} \\approx 2.2822 \\times 10^8~\\text{Hz} $$\nExpressed in $\\text{MHz}$ and rounded to three significant figures, the minimum bandwidth is $228~\\text{MHz}$.\n\n**2. Derivation of Maximum Allowable Probe Capacitance ($C_p$)**\nThe probe adds a shunt capacitance $C_p$ to the DUT's capacitance $C_0$. The total capacitance becomes $C_{tot} = C_0 + C_p$. This perturbs the circuit, changing the damped natural frequency to $\\omega_{d,p}$. The expression for the perturbed squared frequency is:\n$$ \\omega_{d,p}^2 = \\frac{1}{L(C_0 + C_p)} - \\frac{R^2}{4L^2} $$\nThe design target requires the measured ringing frequency to deviate by no more than $2\\%$ from the unperturbed frequency. Let the maximum frequency error be $\\epsilon_f = 0.02$. Since adding capacitance lowers the frequency ($\\omega_{d,p}  \\omega_{d,0}$), this constraint is expressed as:\n$$ \\frac{\\omega_{d,0} - \\omega_{d,p}}{\\omega_{d,0}} \\le \\epsilon_f \\implies \\omega_{d,p} \\ge (1 - \\epsilon_f)\\omega_{d,0} $$\nSquaring both sides gives:\n$$ \\omega_{d,p}^2 \\ge (1 - \\epsilon_f)^2 \\omega_{d,0}^2 $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the squared frequencies:\n$$ \\frac{1}{L(C_0 + C_p)} - \\frac{R^2}{4L^2} \\ge (1 - \\epsilon_f)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{LC_0} - \\frac{R^2}{4L^2}\\right) $$\nTo find the maximum allowable $C_p$, we solve this inequality for $C_p$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{L(C_0 + C_p)} \\ge (1 - \\epsilon_f)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{LC_0} - \\frac{R^2}{4L^2}\\right) + \\frac{R^2}{4L^2} $$\n$$ C_0 + C_p \\le \\frac{1}{L\\left[ (1 - \\epsilon_f)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{LC_0} - \\frac{R^2}{4L^2}\\right) + \\frac{R^2}{4L^2} \\right]} $$\nThe maximum allowable probe capacitance $C_{p,max}$ is therefore:\n$$ C_{p,max} = \\frac{1}{L\\left[ (1 - \\epsilon_f)^2 \\omega_{d,0}^2 + \\frac{R^2}{4L^2} \\right]} - C_0 $$\nUsing $\\epsilon_f = 0.02$ and previously calculated values:\n$$ (1 - 0.02)^2 \\omega_{d,0}^2 = (0.98)^2 \\times (2.2212 \\times 10^{17}) \\approx 0.9604 \\times 2.2212 \\times 10^{17} \\approx 2.13326 \\times 10^{17}~\\text{rad}^2/\\text{s}^2 $$\nThe term in the denominator becomes:\n$$ L\\left[ (2.13326 \\times 10^{17}) + (1.0 \\times 10^{14}) \\right] = (30 \\times 10^{-9}) \\left[ 2.13426 \\times 10^{17} \\right] \\approx 6.40278 \\times 10^9~\\text{s}^{-1} $$\n$$ C_0 + C_p \\le \\frac{1}{6.40278 \\times 10^9} \\approx 1.56181 \\times 10^{-10}~\\text{F} = 156.181~\\text{pF} $$\n$$ C_{p,max} = 156.181~\\text{pF} - C_0 = 156.181~\\text{pF} - 150~\\text{pF} = 6.181~\\text{pF} $$\nRounded to three significant figures, the maximum allowable probe capacitance is $6.18~\\text{pF}$.",
