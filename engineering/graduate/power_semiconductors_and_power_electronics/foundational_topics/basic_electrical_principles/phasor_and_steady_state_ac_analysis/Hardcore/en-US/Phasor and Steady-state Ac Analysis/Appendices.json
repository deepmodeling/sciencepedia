            "problem": "An inductor wound on a magnetic core and used in a high-frequency power electronic converter is excited by a sinusoidal terminal voltage $v(t)=\\hat{V}\\cos(\\omega t)$ at angular frequency $\\omega$, where $\\hat{V}$ is the peak amplitude. The device is operated at a fixed flux swing and frequency so that its magnetic core exhibits a repeatable, steady average power dissipation due to hysteresis and eddy currents, denoted $P_{\\text{core}}$, when the terminal voltage has root-mean-square magnitude $V_{\\text{rms}}=\\hat{V}/\\sqrt{2}$. The winding copper loss is negligible for this experiment.\n\nStarting only from first principles of sinusoidal steady-state and phasor analysis, namely (i) the definition of complex power $S$ for a two-terminal element under sinusoidal excitation, (ii) the relationship between average (real) power and the in-phase component of current, and (iii) the admittance representation of linear two-terminal networks, do the following:\n\n1. Provide a rigorous justification for modeling the core loss by a linear resistance $R_{c}$ connected in parallel with an ideal inductance $L$ under the stated operating condition.

            "solution": "This problem consists of two parts. The first part requires a rigorous justification for modeling the core loss of a physical inductor with a parallel resistor. The second part asks for the derivation of the phase angle of the resulting circuit model.\n\n### Part 1: Justification of the Parallel R-L Model\n\nWe begin from the first principles as stipulated. The physical device is a two-terminal element excited by a sinusoidal voltage $v(t) = \\hat{V}\\cos(\\omega t)$. It draws a current $i(t)$ and dissipates a constant average power $P_{\\text{core}}$.\n\nThe average power $P$ dissipated in any two-terminal device over one period $T = 2\\pi/\\omega$ is given by the integral of the instantaneous power $p(t) = v(t)i(t)$:\n$$\nP = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} v(t)i(t) \\,dt\n$$\nFor a linear system in sinusoidal steady-state, the current $i(t)$ will also be sinusoidal with the same frequency $\\omega$, but with a certain amplitude $\\hat{I}$ and phase shift $\\theta$ relative to the voltage. We can decompose this current into two orthogonal components: one component in-phase with the voltage, $i_p(t)$, and one component in quadrature (i.e., shifted by $\\pi/2$ radians) with the voltage, $i_q(t)$.\n$$\ni(t) = i_p(t) + i_q(t)\n$$\nThe in-phase component is of the form $i_p(t) = \\hat{I}_p \\cos(\\omega t)$, and the quadrature component is of the form $i_q(t) = \\hat{I}_q \\cos(\\omega t \\pm \\pi/2)$.\n\nWhen we compute the average power, the contribution from the quadrature component vanishes due to the orthogonality of sine and cosine functions over a full period:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} v(t)i_q(t) \\,dt = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} [\\hat{V}\\cos(\\omega t)][\\pm \\hat{I}_q \\sin(\\omega t)] \\,dt = \\pm \\frac{\\hat{V}\\hat{I}_q}{2T} \\int_{0}^{T} \\sin(2\\omega t) \\,dt = 0\n$$\nTherefore, the average power dissipation depends solely on the in-phase component of the current:\n$$\nP = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} v(t)i_p(t) \\,dt = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} [\\hat{V}\\cos(\\omega t)][\\hat{I}_p \\cos(\\omega t)] \\,dt = \\frac{\\hat{V}\\hat{I}_p}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} \\cos^2(\\omega t) \\,dt = \\frac{\\hat{V}\\hat{I}_p}{2}\n$$\nUsing root-mean-square (RMS) values, where $V_{\\text{rms}} = \\hat{V}/\\sqrt{2}$ and $I_{p,\\text{rms}} = \\hat{I}_p/\\sqrt{2}$, this is $P = V_{\\text{rms}}I_{p,\\text{rms}}$. We are given that the device dissipates $P_{\\text{core}}$, so $P_{\\text{core}} = V_{\\text{rms}}I_{p,\\text{rms}}$.\n\nThe problem asks us to use the admittance representation. Let the voltage and current be represented by phasors $V$ and $I$. The admittance of the device is defined as $Y = I/V$. The admittance is generally a complex quantity, $Y = G + jB$, where $G$ is the conductance and $B$ is the susceptance.\n\nThe complex power $S$ delivered to the device is defined as $S = V I^*$, where $I^*$ is the complex conjugate of the current phasor. Substituting $I=YV$, we get:\n$$\nS = V(YV)^* = V Y^* V^* = (VV^*)Y^* = |V|^2 Y^*\n$$\nHere, $|V|$ is the magnitude of the voltage phasor, which is the RMS voltage $V_{\\text{rms}}$. So, $S = V_{\\text{rms}}^2 Y^* = V_{\\text{rms}}^2 (G - jB)$.\nThe average (real) power $P$ is the real part of the complex power $S$:\n$$\nP = \\text{Re}\\{S\\} = \\text{Re}\\{V_{\\text{rms}}^2 (G - jB)\\} = V_{\\text{rms}}^2 G\n$$\nWe are given that the device dissipates an average power $P_{\\text{core}}$. Therefore, we can equate this to the expression above to find the conductance $G$ that represents this loss:\n$$\nP_{\\text{core}} = V_{\\text{rms}}^2 G \\implies G = \\frac{P_{\\text{core}}}{V_{\\text{rms}}^2}\n$$\nA pure conductance $G$ is electrically equivalent to a pure resistance $R_c = 1/G$ connected in parallel with the voltage source. The value of this resistance is determined by the core loss and the operating voltage: $R_c = V_{\\text{rms}}^2 / P_{\\text{core}}$. This resistive element perfectly models the dissipative part of the device's behavior, as it draws a current that is purely in-phase with the applied voltage and dissipates the exact amount of average power $P_{\\text{core}}$.\n\nThe physical inductor's primary function is to store energy in its magnetic field, which corresponds to reactive power exchange. This behavior is captured by the imaginary part of the admittance, the susceptance $B = \\text{Im}\\{Y\\}$. An ideal inductor with inductance $L$ has an impedance of $Z_L = j\\omega L$. Its admittance is:\n$$\nY_L = \\frac{1}{Z_L} = \\frac{1}{j\\omega L} = -j\\frac{1}{\\omega L}\n$$\nThis is a purely imaginary admittance with a susceptance $B_L = -1/(\\omega L)$. It draws a current that is purely in quadrature (lagging by $\\pi/2$ radians) with the voltage and dissipates no average power. This element models the energy storage function of the device.\n\nIn a parallel circuit, admittances add. By Kirchhoff's Current Law, the total current is the sum of the currents through the parallel branches. In the phasor domain, this means the total admittance is the sum of the admittances of the parallel components.\nTherefore, a model consisting of the derived core loss resistance $R_c$ (with conductance $G_c = 1/R_c$) connected in parallel with an ideal inductance $L$ has a total admittance:\n$$\nY_{\\text{model}} = Y_R + Y_L = \\frac{1}{R_c} + \\frac{1}{j\\omega L} = \\frac{1}{R_c} - j\\frac{1}{\\omega L}\n$$\nThis model's admittance has a real part, $G_c = 1/R_c$, which accounts for the dissipation of average power $P_{\\text{core}}$, and an imaginary part, $B_L = -1/(\\omega L)$, which accounts for the inductive energy storage. This rigorously justifies, from first principles of power and admittance, the modeling of the lossy inductor as an ideal inductor $L$ in parallel with a core loss resistance $R_c$.\n\n### Part 2: Derivation of the Phase Angle\n\nUsing the parallel model justified above, we now derive the phase angle $\\varphi$ between the total current $I$ and the terminal voltage $V$. The phase angle is explicitly defined as $\\varphi = \\angle I - \\angle V$.\n\nThe total admittance of the parallel R-L network is:\n$$\nY = \\frac{1}{R_c} - j\\frac{1}{\\omega L}\n$$\nThe relationship between the phasors for voltage, current, and admittance is given by Ohm's law:\n$$\nI = YV\n$$\nTaking the angle of both sides of this complex equation, we find the relationship between the phase angles:\n$$\n\\angle I = \\angle (YV) = \\angle Y + \\angle V\n$$\nRearranging this equation to match the definition of $\\varphi$:\n$$\n\\varphi = \\angle I - \\angle V = \\angle Y\n$$\nThus, the required phase angle $\\varphi$ is simply the angle of the total admittance $Y$. The admittance $Y$ is a complex number of the form $a+jb$, where the real part is $a = 1/R_c$ and the imaginary part is $b = -1/(\\omega L)$.\n\nThe angle of a complex number $a+jb$ is given by $\\arctan(b/a)$. Applying this to our admittance $Y$:\n$$\n\\varphi = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{-\\frac{1}{\\omega L}}{\\frac{1}{R_c}}\\right)\n$$\nSimplifying the argument of the arctan function:\n$$\n\\varphi = \\arctan\\left(-\\frac{R_c}{\\omega L}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the phase angle $\\varphi(\\omega, L, R_c)$ in radians. Since $\\omega$, $L$, and $R_c$ are positive quantities, the argument of the arctan is negative, which means $\\varphi$ is negative. This correctly indicates that the total current lags the voltage, as expected for an inductive circuit.",

The term $\\frac{\\sqrt{r_C^2 + (\\omega_0 L)^2}}{r_L + r_C}$ is a voltage scaling factor. Since the inductive reactance $\\omega_0 L$ is typically much larger than the resistances $r_L$ and $r_C$, this factor is greater than $1$, causing the voltage across the reactive components to be significantly higher than the source voltage $V_h$. The total series resistance $r_L + r_C$ in the denominator serves to limit this current and, consequently, the magnified voltage. A lower total resistance would lead to a higher resonant current and greater voltage stress on both the inductor and the capacitor.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$V_h = 20\\ \\text{V}$\n$\\omega_{0} = 2\\pi \\times 10^{4}\\ \\text{rad}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$\n$L = 1.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{H}$\n$r_{L} = 0.50\\ \\Omega$\n$r_{C} = 0.20\\ \\Omega$\n\nFirst, calculate the total series resistance:\n$$r_L + r_C = 0.50\\ \\Omega + 0.20\\ \\Omega = 0.70\\ \\Omega$$\nNext, calculate the inductive reactance at the resonant frequency:\n$$\\omega_0 L = (2\\pi \\times 10^{4}\\ \\text{rad}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}) \\times (1.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{H}) = 20\\pi\\ \\Omega$$\nNow, substitute these into the expression for $V_{C,RMS}$:\n$$V_{C,RMS} = \\frac{20}{0.70} \\sqrt{(0.20)^2 + (20\\pi)^2}$$\n$$V_{C,RMS} = \\frac{200}{7} \\sqrt{0.04 + 400\\pi^2}$$\n$$V_{C,RMS} \\approx \\frac{200}{7} \\sqrt{0.04 + 400 \\times (9.8696044)}$$\n$$V_{C,RMS} \\approx \\frac{200}{7} \\sqrt{0.04 + 3947.84176}$$\n$$V_{C,RMS} \\approx \\frac{200}{7} \\sqrt{3947.88176}$$\n$$V_{C,RMS} \\approx \\frac{200}{7} \\times 62.83217$$\n$$V_{C,RMS} \\approx 28.571428 \\times 62.83217 \\approx 1795.20486\\ \\text{V}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested:\n$$V_{C,RMS} \\approx 1795\\ \\text{V}$$\nThe final steady-state RMS magnitude of the capacitor voltage at $\\omega_0$ is $1795\\ \\text{V}$.",
