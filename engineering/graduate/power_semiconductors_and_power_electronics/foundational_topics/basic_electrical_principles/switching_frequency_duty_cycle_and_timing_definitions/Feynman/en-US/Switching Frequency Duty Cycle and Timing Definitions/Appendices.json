            "problem": "A Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) leg is gated by a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) modulator that compares a periodic carrier to a constant reference. The carrier is a sawtooth wave of switching frequency $f_{s} = 100\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$ that resets at $t = 0$ each period and increases monotonically to its peak at $t = T$, where $T = 1/f_{s}$ is the switching period.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and found to be self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. All provided definitions and data are consistent and sufficient for deriving a unique solution.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the turn-on and turn-off times for two Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) strategies, leading-edge (LE) and center-aligned (CA), based on their provided definitions.\n\nFirst, we establish the switching period, $T$, from the given switching frequency, $f_{s}$.\n$$T = \\frac{1}{f_{s}}$$\nGiven $f_{s} = 100\\,\\mathrm{kHz} = 100 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, the period is:\n$$T = \\frac{1}{100 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}} = 1 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$$\n\nThe duty cycle, $D$, is defined as $D = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} u(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t$, where $u(t) \\in \\{0,1\\}$ represents the gate signal. Since the problem specifies a single contiguous ON interval, let this interval be $[t_{\\mathrm{on}}, t_{\\mathrm{off}}]$. The integral evaluates to the duration of this interval, $t_{\\mathrm{off}} - t_{\\mathrm{on}}$.\nTherefore, the definition of the duty cycle simplifies to:\n$$D = \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{off}} - t_{\\mathrm{on}}}{T}$$\nThis fundamental relationship can be rearranged to express the total ON-time duration within a period $T$:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{on\\_duration}} = t_{\\mathrm{off}} - t_{\\mathrm{on}} = D \\cdot T$$\nWith the given duty cycle $D = 0.3$, the required ON-time duration is:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{on\\_duration}} = 0.3 \\times 10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s} = 3\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$$\n\nWe will now analyze each PWM strategy separately.\n\n**1. Leading-Edge PWM (LE-PWM)**\n\nThe problem defines the timing for LE-PWM such that the single contiguous ON interval is $[t_{\\mathrm{on,LE}}, T]$. This means the pulse is aligned to the end of the switching period.\nFrom this definition, the turn-off time is explicitly given as:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{off,LE}} = T$$\nThe duration of the ON interval is $t_{\\mathrm{off,LE}} - t_{\\mathrm{on,LE}} = T - t_{\\mathrm{on,LE}}$.\nWe equate this duration to the required ON-time duration, $D \\cdot T$:\n$$T - t_{\\mathrm{on,LE}} = D \\cdot T$$\nSolving for the turn-on time, $t_{\\mathrm{on,LE}}$:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{on,LE}} = T - D \\cdot T = T(1 - D)$$\nNumerically evaluating for $T = 10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$ and $D = 0.3$:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{on,LE}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s} \\times (1 - 0.3) = 10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s} \\times 0.7 = 7\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$$\n$$t_{\\mathrm{off,LE}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$$\n\n**2. Center-Aligned PWM (CA-PWM)**\n\nThe problem defines the timing for CA-PWM such that the single contiguous ON interval, $[t_{\\mathrm{on,CA}}, t_{\\mathrm{off,CA}}]$, is centered about the midpoint of the period, $t = T/2$.\nThe duration of this ON interval must satisfy the duty cycle requirement:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{off,CA}} - t_{\\mathrm{on,CA}} = D \\cdot T \\quad (1)$$\nThe centering constraint means that the midpoint of the interval is equal to the midpoint of the period:\n$$\\frac{t_{\\mathrm{on,CA}} + t_{\\mathrm{off,CA}}}{2} = \\frac{T}{2}$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{on,CA}} + t_{\\mathrm{off,CA}} = T \\quad (2)$$\nWe now have a system of two linear equations, $(1)$ and $(2)$, with two unknowns, $t_{\\mathrm{on,CA}}$ and $t_{\\mathrm{off,CA}}$. To solve for $t_{\\mathrm{on,CA}}$, we subtract equation $(1)$ from equation $(2)$:\n$$(t_{\\mathrm{on,CA}} + t_{\\mathrm{off,CA}}) - (t_{\\mathrm{off,CA}} - t_{\\mathrm{on,CA}}) = T - D \\cdot T$$\n$$2 \\cdot t_{\\mathrm{on,CA}} = T(1 - D)$$\n$$t_{\\mathrm{on,CA}} = \\frac{T(1 - D)}{2}$$\nTo solve for $t_{\\mathrm{off,CA}}$, we add equation $(1)$ and equation $(2)$:\n$$(t_{\\mathrm{off,CA}} - t_{\\mathrm{on,CA}}) + (t_{\\mathrm{on,CA}} + t_{\\mathrm{off,CA}}) = D \\cdot T + T$$\n$$2 \\cdot t_{\\mathrm{off,CA}} = T(1 + D)$$\n$$t_{\\mathrm{off,CA}} = \\frac{T(1 + D)}{2}$$\nNumerically evaluating for $T = 10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$ and $D = 0.3$:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{on,CA}} = \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s} \\times (1 - 0.3)}{2} = \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s} \\times 0.7}{2} = 3.5\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$$\n$$t_{\\mathrm{off,CA}} = \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s} \\times (1 + 0.3)}{2} = \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s} \\times 1.3}{2} = 6.5\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$$\n\n**Summary of Results**\n\nThe derived times are:\n- For Leading-Edge PWM: $t_{\\mathrm{on,LE}} = 7\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$, $t_{\\mathrm{off,LE}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$\n- For Center-Aligned PWM: $t_{\\mathrm{on,CA}} = 3.5\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$, $t_{\\mathrm{off,CA}} = 6.5\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be reported in microseconds to four significant figures.\n- $t_{\\mathrm{on,LE}} = 7.000\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$\n- $t_{\\mathrm{off,LE}} = 10.00\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$\n- $t_{\\mathrm{on,CA}} = 3.500\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$\n- $t_{\\mathrm{off,CA}} = 6.500\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$\n\nThe final answer should be presented in the specified order: $[t_{\\mathrm{on,LE}},\\, t_{\\mathrm{off,LE}},\\, t_{\\mathrm{on,CA}},\\, t_{\\mathrm{off,CA}}]$.",

The parameters given ($f_s$, $t_{\\mathrm{on},\\min}$, $t_{\\mathrm{off},\\min}$) are standard specifications for power converters and their gate drivers, and the values are physically realistic.

Since $t_{\\mathrm{on},\\min} + t_{\\mathrm{off},\\min} \\le T_s$, the constraints are consistent and allow for a valid range of operation. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe fundamental relationship between switching frequency $f_s$ and switching period $T_s$ is given by:\n$$T_s = \\frac{1}{f_s}$$\nUsing the provided switching frequency $f_s = 1\\,\\mathrm{MHz} = 1 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$:\n$$T_s = \\frac{1}{1 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Hz}} = 1 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{ns}$$\n\nThe duty cycle $D$ of the high-side switch is defined as the ratio of its on-time, $t_{\\mathrm{on}}$, to the total switching period, $T_s$:\n$$D = \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{on}}}{T_s}$$\nThe gate driver imposes a physical constraint on the minimum duration for which the high-side switch can be turned on. This is the minimum on-time, $t_{\\mathrm{on},\\min} = 60\\,\\mathrm{ns}$. This constraint limits the minimum achievable duty cycle of the converter. Any commanded on-time must satisfy $t_{\\mathrm{on}} \\ge t_{\\mathrm{on},\\min}$.\n\nThe minimum realizable duty cycle, which we will denote as $D_{\\min,\\mathrm{real}}$, is therefore determined by this minimum on-time:\n$$D_{\\min,\\mathrm{real}} = \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{on},\\min}}{T_s}$$\nSubstituting the known values for $t_{\\mathrm{on},\\min}$ and $T_s$:\n$$D_{\\min,\\mathrm{real}} = \\frac{60\\,\\mathrm{ns}}{1000\\,\\mathrm{ns}} = 0.06$$\nThis means that due to the driver's limitation, the converter cannot physically produce a duty cycle smaller than $0.06$, or $6\\%$.\n\nFor completeness, we can also note that the minimum off-time constraint, $t_{\\mathrm{off},\\min} = 60\\,\\mathrm{ns}$, limits the maximum realizable duty cycle, $D_{\\max,\\mathrm{real}}$. The high-side off-time is $t_{\\mathrm{off}}=T_s - t_{\\mathrm{on}}$. The constraint $t_{\\mathrm{off}} \\ge t_{\\mathrm{off},\\min}$ implies $T_s - t_{\\mathrm{on}} \\ge t_{\\mathrm{off},\\min}$, which rearranges to $t_{\\mathrm{on}} \\le T_s - t_{\\mathrm{off},\\min}$.

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in power electronics. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n## SOLUTION DERIVATION\n\nThe solution requires a multi-step process. First, we determine the steady-state operating point of the converter to find the inductor current. Second, we determine the duration of the body diode conduction. Finally, we calculate the energy dissipated during this interval.\n\n**1. Steady-State Converter Analysis**\n\nFor an ideal boost converter operating in CCM, the relationship between the input voltage $V_{\\mathrm{in}}$, output voltage $V_{\\mathrm{out}}$, and duty cycle $D$ (fraction of the period the low-side MOSFET is on) is:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{out}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{in}}}{1 - D}$$\nWe can solve for the duty cycle $D$:\n$$1 - D = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{in}}}{V_{\\mathrm{out}}}$$\n$$D = 1 - \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{in}}}{V_{\\mathrm{out}}} = 1 - \\frac{12\\,\\mathrm{V}}{48\\,\\mathrm{V}} = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$$\nThe problem states the power stage is idealized and lossless for current estimation. Therefore, input power equals output power: $P_{\\mathrm{in}} = P_{\\mathrm{out}} = 120\\,\\mathrm{W}$. The average input current $I_{\\mathrm{in}}$ is:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{in}}}{V_{\\mathrm{in}}} = \\frac{120\\,\\mathrm{W}}{12\\,\\mathrm{V}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{A}$$\nIn a boost converter, the average inductor current $I_L$ is equal to the average input current:\n$$I_L = I_{\\mathrm{in}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{A}$$\nNext, we calculate the peak-to-peak inductor current ripple, $\\Delta I_L$. During the on-time ($t_{\\mathrm{on}}$), the voltage across the inductor $L$ is $V_{\\mathrm{in}}$. The on-time is given by $t_{\\mathrm{on}} = D \\cdot T_s = D / f_s$.\n$$t_{\\mathrm{on}} = \\frac{D}{f_s} = \\frac{0.75}{300 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{Hz}} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 2.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$$\nThe inductor current ripple is calculated using the fundamental inductor equation $v_L = L di_L/dt$. Since the inductor voltage during the on-time is $V_{\\mathrm{in}}$, the ripple for a linear current rise is:\n$$\\Delta I_L = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{in}} \\cdot t_{\\mathrm{on}}}{L} = \\frac{12\\,\\mathrm{V} \\cdot 2.5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}}{10 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{H}} = 3\\,\\mathrm{A}$$\nThe inductor current at the transition from on-time to off-time is the peak inductor current, $I_{L, \\mathrm{peak}}$. This is the current that will flow through the high-side body diode at the beginning of the dead time.\n$$I_{L, \\mathrm{peak}} = I_L + \\frac{\\Delta I_L}{2} = 10\\,\\mathrm{A} + \\frac{3\\,\\mathrm{A}}{2} = 11.5\\,\\mathrm{A}$$\n\n**2. Duration of Body Diode Conduction ($t_{bd}$)**\n\nThe problem specifies a non-overlap dead time between the low-side MOSFET turning off and the high-side MOSFET turning on. When the low-side switch turns off, the inductor current ($I_{L, \\mathrm{peak}}$) is commutated to the only available path, which is the intrinsic body diode of the high-side MOSFET. This conduction continues until the channel of the high-side MOSFET itself becomes conductive.\nThe high-side MOSFET channel begins to conduct when its gate-to-source voltage reaches the threshold voltage. The time required for this is the time it takes the gate driver to supply the necessary gate charge to reach this threshold, $Q_{\\mathrm{th}}$. Given a constant gate driver current $I_{\\mathrm{drv}}$, this time, which we identify as the body diode conduction time $t_{bd}$, is found using the fundamental charge-current-time relation $Q=I \\cdot t$:\n$$t_{bd} = \\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{th}}}{I_{\\mathrm{drv}}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$t_{bd} = \\frac{8\\,\\mathrm{nC}}{0.5\\,\\mathrm{A}} = \\frac{8 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{C}}{0.5\\,\\mathrm{A}} = 16 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 16\\,\\mathrm{ns}$$\n\n**3. Energy Dissipated in the Body Diode ($E_{bd}$)**\n\nThe energy dissipated in the body diode during this interval is the product of the power dissipated and the duration of conduction. The power dissipation is the product of the diode's forward voltage $V_f$ and the current flowing through it. The problem states to assume the inductor current is constant over this very short interval. The current is therefore $I_{L, \\mathrm{peak}}$.\nThe instantaneous power dissipated in the diode is:\n$$P_{bd} = V_f \\cdot I_{L, \\mathrm{peak}} = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{V} \\cdot 11.5\\,\\mathrm{A} = 9.2\\,\\mathrm{W}$$\nThe total energy dissipated per switching cycle, $E_{bd}$, is this power multiplied by the conduction duration $t_{bd}$:\n$$E_{bd} = P_{bd} \\cdot t_{bd} = 9.2\\,\\mathrm{W} \\cdot 16 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 147.2 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{J}$$\nThe problem requests the result in microjoules ($\\mu\\mathrm{J}$).\n$$E_{bd} = 0.1472\\,\\mu\\mathrm{J}$$\n\n**4. Final Numerical Results**\n\nThe problem asks for the duration in nanoseconds and the energy per cycle in microjoules, with results rounded to three significant figures.\n- Duration: $t_{bd} = 16.0\\,\\mathrm{ns}$\n- Energy per cycle: $E_{bd} = 0.147\\,\\mu\\mathrm{J}$\nThe final answer is presented as a two-entry row matrix.",
