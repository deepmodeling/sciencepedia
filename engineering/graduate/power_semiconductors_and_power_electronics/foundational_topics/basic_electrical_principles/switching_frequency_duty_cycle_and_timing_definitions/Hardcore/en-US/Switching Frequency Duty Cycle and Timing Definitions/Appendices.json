            "problem": "A Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) leg is gated by a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) modulator that compares a periodic carrier to a constant reference. The carrier is a sawtooth wave of switching frequency $f_{s} = 100\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$ that resets at $t = 0$ each period and increases monotonically to its peak at $t = T$, where $T = 1/f_{s}$ is the switching period. The reference is a constant that sets the duty cycle to $D = 0.3$, where the duty cycle is defined as $D = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} u(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t$ with $u(t) \\in \\{0,1\\}$ denoting the idealized gate signal being $1$ when the device is ON and $0$ when it is OFF.\n\nTwo PWM timing strategies are employed:\n\n1. Leading-edge PWM: The pulse that satisfies the duty constraint occurs at the end of the period, such that the device turns OFF at $t = T$ and turns ON earlier in the same period at some time $t_{\\mathrm{on,LE}}$, generating a single contiguous ON interval $[t_{\\mathrm{on,LE}},\\,T]$.\n\n2.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and found to be self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. All provided definitions and data are consistent and sufficient for deriving a unique solution.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the turn-on and turn-off times for two Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) strategies, leading-edge (LE) and center-aligned (CA), based on their provided definitions.\n\nFirst, we establish the switching period, $T$, from the given switching frequency, $f_{s}$.\n$$T = \\frac{1}{f_{s}}$$\nGiven $f_{s} = 100\\,\\mathrm{kHz} = 100 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, the period is:\n$$T = \\frac{1}{100 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}} = 1 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$$\n\nThe duty cycle, $D$, is defined as $D = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} u(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t$, where $u(t) \\in \\{0,1\\}$ represents the gate signal. Since the problem specifies a single contiguous ON interval, let this interval be $[t_{\\mathrm{on}}, t_{\\mathrm{off}}]$. The integral evaluates to the duration of this interval, $t_{\\mathrm{off}} - t_{\\mathrm{on}}$.\nTherefore, the definition of the duty cycle simplifies to:\n$$D = \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{off}} - t_{\\mathrm{on}}}{T}$$\nThis fundamental relationship can be rearranged to express the total ON-time duration within a period $T$:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{on\\_duration}} = t_{\\mathrm{off}} - t_{\\mathrm{on}} = D \\cdot T$$\nWith the given duty cycle $D = 0.3$, the required ON-time duration is:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{on\\_duration}} = 0.3 \\times 10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s} = 3\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$$\n\nWe will now analyze each PWM strategy separately.\n\n**1. Leading-Edge PWM (LE-PWM)**\n\nThe problem defines the timing for LE-PWM such that the single contiguous ON interval is $[t_{\\mathrm{on,LE}}, T]$. This means the pulse is aligned to the end of the switching period.\nFrom this definition, the turn-off time is explicitly given as:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{off,LE}} = T$$\nThe duration of the ON interval is $t_{\\mathrm{off,LE}} - t_{\\mathrm{on,LE}} = T - t_{\\mathrm{on,LE}}$.\nWe equate this duration to the required ON-time duration, $D \\cdot T$:\n$$T - t_{\\mathrm{on,LE}} = D \\cdot T$$\nSolving for the turn-on time, $t_{\\mathrm{on,LE}}$:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{on,LE}} = T - D \\cdot T = T(1 - D)$$\nNumerically evaluating for $T = 10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$ and $D = 0.3$:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{on,LE}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s} \\times (1 - 0.3) = 10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s} \\times 0.7 = 7\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$$\n$$t_{\\mathrm{off,LE}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$$\n\n**2.

To solve for $t_{\\mathrm{on,CA}}$, we subtract equation $(1)$ from equation $(2)$:\n$$(t_{\\mathrm{on,CA}} + t_{\\mathrm{off,CA}}) - (t_{\\mathrm{off,CA}} - t_{\\mathrm{on,CA}}) = T - D \\cdot T$$\n$$2 \\cdot t_{\\mathrm{on,CA}} = T(1 - D)$$\n$$t_{\\mathrm{on,CA}} = \\frac{T(1 - D)}{2}$$\nTo solve for $t_{\\mathrm{off,CA}}$, we add equation $(1)$ and equation $(2)$:\n$$(t_{\\mathrm{off,CA}} - t_{\\mathrm{on,CA}}) + (t_{\\mathrm{on,CA}} + t_{\\mathrm{off,CA}}) = D \\cdot T + T$$\n$$2 \\cdot t_{\\mathrm{off,CA}} = T(1 + D)$$\n$$t_{\\mathrm{off,CA}} = \\frac{T(1 + D)}{2}$$\nNumerically evaluating for $T = 10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$ and $D = 0.3$:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{on,CA}} = \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s} \\times (1 - 0.3)}{2} = \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s} \\times 0.7}{2} = 3.5\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$$\n$$t_{\\mathrm{off,CA}} = \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s} \\times (1 + 0.3)}{2} = \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s} \\times 1.3}{2} = 6.5\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$$\n\n**Summary of Results**\n\nThe derived times are:\n- For Leading-Edge PWM: $t_{\\mathrm{on,LE}} = 7\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$, $t_{\\mathrm{off,LE}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$\n- For Center-Aligned PWM: $t_{\\mathrm{on,CA}} = 3.5\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$, $t_{\\mathrm{off,CA}} = 6.5\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be reported in microseconds to four significant figures.\n- $t_{\\mathrm{on,LE}} = 7.000\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$\n- $t_{\\mathrm{off,LE}} = 10.00\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$\n- $t_{\\mathrm{on,CA}} = 3.500\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$\n- $t_{\\mathrm{off,CA}} = 6.500\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$\n\nThe final answer should be presented in the specified order: $[t_{\\mathrm{on,LE}},\\, t_{\\mathrm{off,LE}},\\, t_{\\mathrm{on,CA}},\\, t_{\\mathrm{off,CA}}]$.",

The parameters given ($f_s$, $t_{\\mathrm{on},\\min}$, $t_{\\mathrm{off},\\min}$) are standard specifications for power converters and their gate drivers, and the values are physically realistic. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information and a clear objective. The terms are defined precisely, and the setup is self-contained and free of contradictions. The sum of the minimum on-time and minimum off-time is $60\\,\\mathrm{ns} + 60\\,\\mathrm{ns} = 120\\,\\mathrm{ns}$. The switching period is $T_s = 1/f_s = 1/(1\\,\\mathrm{MHz}) = 1000\\,\\mathrm{ns}$. Since $t_{\\mathrm{on},\\min} + t_{\\mathrm{off},\\min} \\le T_s$, the constraints are consistent and allow for a valid range of operation. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe fundamental relationship between switching frequency $f_s$ and switching period $T_s$ is given by:\n$$T_s = \\frac{1}{f_s}$$\nUsing the provided switching frequency $f_s = 1\\,\\mathrm{MHz} = 1 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$:\n$$T_s = \\frac{1}{1 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Hz}} = 1 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{ns}$$\n\nThe duty cycle $D$ of the high-side switch is defined as the ratio of its on-time, $t_{\\mathrm{on}}$, to the total switching period, $T_s$:\n$$D = \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{on}}}{T_s}$$\nThe gate driver imposes a physical constraint on the minimum duration for which the high-side switch can be turned on. This is the minimum on-time, $t_{\\mathrm{on},\\min} = 60\\,\\mathrm{ns}$. This constraint limits the minimum achievable duty cycle of the converter. Any commanded on-time must satisfy $t_{\\mathrm{on}} \\ge t_{\\mathrm{on},\\min}$.\n\nThe minimum realizable duty cycle, which we will denote as $D_{\\min,\\mathrm{real}}$, is therefore determined by this minimum on-time:\n$$D_{\\min,\\mathrm{real}} = \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{on},\\min}}{T_s}$$\nSubstituting the known values for $t_{\\mathrm{on},\\min}$ and $T_s$:\n$$D_{\\min,\\mathrm{real}} = \\frac{60\\,\\mathrm{ns}}{1000\\,\\mathrm{ns}} = 0.06$$\nThis means that due to the driver's limitation, the converter cannot physically produce a duty cycle smaller than $0.06$, or $6\\%$.\n\nFor completeness, we can also note that the minimum off-time constraint, $t_{\\mathrm{off},\\min} = 60\\,\\mathrm{ns}$, limits the maximum realizable duty cycle, $D_{\\max,\\mathrm{real}}$. The high-side off-time is $t_{\\mathrm{off}}=T_s - t_{\\mathrm{on}}$. The constraint $t_{\\mathrm{off}} \\ge t_{\\mathrm{off},\\min}$ implies $T_s - t_{\\mathrm{on}} \\ge t_{\\mathrm{off},\\min}$, which rearranges to $t_{\\mathrm{on}} \\le T_s - t_{\\mathrm{off},\\min}$. Thus:\n$$D_{\\max,\\mathrm{real}} = \\frac{T_s - t_{\\mathrm{off},\\min}}{T_s} = 1 - \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{off},\\min}}{T_s} = 1 - \\frac{60\\,\\mathrm{ns}}{1000\\,\\mathrm{ns}} = 0.94$$\nThe achievable duty cycle range is therefore $[0.06, 0.94]$.\n\nThe problem asks for the violation margin, $m$, which is defined as the difference between the minimum realizable duty cycle and the required minimum duty cycle, $D_{\\min,\\mathrm{req}}$. The required minimum duty cycle is given as $D_{\\min,\\mathrm{req}} = 0.02$.\nThe violation margin $m$ is calculated as:\n$$m = D_{\\min,\\mathrm{real}} - D_{\\min,\\mathrm{req}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated and given values:\n$$m = 0.06 - 0.02 = 0.04$$\nThis positive margin signifies a \"violation\" because the required minimum duty cycle ($0.02$) is smaller than the minimum duty cycle the hardware can actually produce ($0.06$). The controller would be unable to achieve the target regulation under conditions that demand a duty cycle of $0.02$. The magnitude of this violation is $0.04$.",
