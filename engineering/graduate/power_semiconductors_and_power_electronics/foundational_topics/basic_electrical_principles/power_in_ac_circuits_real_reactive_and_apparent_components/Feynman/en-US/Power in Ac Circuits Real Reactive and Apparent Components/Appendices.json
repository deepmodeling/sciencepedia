A solution will be formulated based on the requested first principles.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires the determination of real power $P$, reactive power $Q$, and apparent power magnitude $\\lvert S\\rvert$ starting from the definition of instantaneous power $p(t)$.\n\nThe instantaneous voltage and current are given by:\n$$v(t) = V_{\\text{m}}\\cos(\\omega t)$$\n$$i(t) = I_{\\text{m}}\\cos(\\omega t - \\phi)$$\nwhere $V_{\\text{m}}$ and $I_{\\text{m}}$ are the peak voltage and current, respectively, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $\\phi$ is the phase angle by which the current lags the voltage.\n\nThe instantaneous power $p(t)$ delivered to the load is the product of instantaneous voltage and current:\n$$p(t) = v(t)i(t) = [V_{\\text{m}}\\cos(\\omega t)][I_{\\text{m}}\\cos(\\omega t - \\phi)]$$\n$$p(t) = V_{\\text{m}}I_{\\text{m}}\\cos(\\omega t)\\cos(\\omega t - \\phi)$$\n\nUsing the trigonometric product-to-sum identity $\\cos(A)\\cos(B) = \\frac{1}{2}[\\cos(A-B) + \\cos(A+B)]$, with $A = \\omega t$ and $B = \\omega t - \\phi$, we get:\n$$A-B = \\omega t - (\\omega t - \\phi) = \\phi$$\n$$A+B = \\omega t + (\\omega t - \\phi) = 2\\omega t - \\phi$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $p(t)$:\n$$p(t) = \\frac{V_{\\text{m}}I_{\\text{m}}}{2}[\\cos(\\phi) + \\cos(2\\omega t - \\phi)]$$\n\nThis expression for instantaneous power has two components:\n$1$. A constant (time-invariant) component: $\\frac{V_{\\text{m}}I_{\\text{m}}}{2}\\cos(\\phi)$.\n$2$. A time-varying component oscillating at twice the fundamental frequency ($2\\omega$): $\\frac{V_{\\text{m}}I_{\\text{m}}}{2}\\cos(2\\omega t - \\phi)$.\n\nThe **real power $P$** is defined as the average of the instantaneous power over one full period $T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}$. The average of any sinusoidal function with a non-zero frequency over a full period is zero. Therefore, the average of the second component is zero.\n$$P = \\langle p(t) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} p(t) dt = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} \\frac{V_{\\text{m}}I_{\\text{m}}}{2}\\cos(\\phi) dt$$\nSince the integrand is constant with respect to time, the integral becomes:\n$$P = \\frac{V_{\\text{m}}I_{\\text{m}}}{2}\\cos(\\phi)$$\n\nThe problem provides root-mean-square (RMS) values. For sinusoidal waveforms, the relationship between peak and RMS values is $V_{\\text{m}} = \\sqrt{2}V_{\\text{rms}}$ and $I_{\\text{m}} = \\sqrt{2}I_{\\text{rms}}$.

Using the identity $\\cos(A-B) = \\cos(A)\\cos(B) + \\sin(A)\\sin(B)$ on the term $\\cos(2\\omega t - \\phi)$:\n$$p(t) = \\frac{V_{\\text{m}}I_{\\text{m}}}{2}[\\cos(\\phi) + \\cos(2\\omega t)\\cos(\\phi) + \\sin(2\\omega t)\\sin(\\phi)]$$\nRearranging the terms:\n$$p(t) = \\underbrace{\\frac{V_{\\text{m}}I_{\\text{m}}}{2}\\cos(\\phi)[1 + \\cos(2\\omega t)]}_{\\text{power dissipated}} + \\underbrace{\\frac{V_{\\text{m}}I_{\\text{m}}}{2}\\sin(\\phi)\\sin(2\\omega t)}_{\\text{power exchanged}}$$\nThe second term represents the power oscillating between the source and the load's energy storage elements (inductors and capacitors). The **reactive power $Q$** is defined as the amplitude of this oscillating term.\n$$Q = \\frac{V_{\\text{m}}I_{\\text{m}}}{2}\\sin(\\phi)$$\nSubstituting the RMS values:\n$$Q = \\frac{(\\sqrt{2}V_{\\text{rms}})(\\sqrt{2}I_{\\text{rms}})}{2}\\sin(\\phi) = V_{\\text{rms}}I_{\\text{rms}}\\sin(\\phi)$$\nThe problem specifies that $Q > 0$ for a lagging current. Since the current lags the voltage, $\\phi > 0$, and for $\\phi$ in the range $(0^{\\circ}, 180^{\\circ})$, $\\sin(\\phi) > 0$, ensuring $Q > 0$ as required.\n\nThe **apparent power magnitude $\\lvert S\\rvert$** is defined as the product of the RMS voltage and RMS current.\n$$\\lvert S\\rvert = V_{\\text{rms}}I_{\\text{rms}}$$\nIt is also the magnitude of the complex power $S = P + jQ$, such that $\\lvert S\\rvert = \\sqrt{P^2 + Q^2}$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the numerical values using the given data:\n$V_{\\text{rms}} = 240$ V\n$I_{\\text{rms}} = 15$ A\n$\\phi = 25^{\\circ}$\n\nFirst, calculate the apparent power magnitude $\\lvert S\\rvert$:\n$$\\lvert S\\rvert = (240)(15) = 3600 \\text{ VA}$$\nIn kilovolt-amperes (kVA), this is:\n$$\\lvert S\\rvert = 3.6 \\text{ kVA}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\lvert S\\rvert = 3.600 \\text{ kVA}$.\n\nNext, calculate the real power $P$:\n$$P = \\lvert S\\rvert \\cos(\\phi) = 3600 \\cos(25^{\\circ})$$\n$$P \\approx 3600 \\times 0.906307787... = 3262.708... \\text{ W}$$\nIn kilowatts (kW), this is:\n$$P \\approx 3.262708... \\text{ kW}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $P = 3.263 \\text{ kW}$.\n\nFinally, calculate the reactive power $Q$:\n$$Q = \\lvert S\\rvert \\sin(\\phi) = 3600 \\sin(25^{\\circ})$$\n$$Q \\approx 3600 \\times 0.42261826... = 1521.4257... \\text{ VAr}$$\nIn kilovolt-amperes reactive (kVAr), this is:\n$$Q \\approx 1.5214257... \\text{ kVAr}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $Q = 1.521 \\text{ kVAr}$.\n\nThe final answers for $P$ (in kW), $Q$ (in kVAr), and $\\lvert S\\rvert$ (in kVA) are $3.263$, $1.521$, and $3.600$, respectively.",

The discrepancy is attributed to distortion power, $D$. The problem provides the governing equation for this case:\n$$D = \\sqrt{\\lvert S\\rvert^2 - P^2 - Q^2}$$\n\nWe are given the following values for a three-phase system:\nLine-to-line RMS voltage, $V_{\\mathrm{LL}} = 400\\,\\mathrm{V}$\nRMS line current, $I_{\\mathrm{L}} = 145\\,\\mathrm{A}$\nTotal real power, $P = 85.0\\,\\mathrm{kW} = 85000\\,\\mathrm{W}$\nTotal reactive power, $Q = 45.0\\,\\mathrm{kVAr} = 45000\\,\\mathrm{VAr}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the magnitude of the total apparent power, $\\lvert S\\rvert$, using the provided formula for a balanced three-phase system:\n$$\\lvert S\\rvert = \\sqrt{3}\\,V_{\\mathrm{LL}} I_{\\mathrm{L}}$$\n$$\\lvert S\\rvert = \\sqrt{3} \\times 400\\,\\mathrm{V} \\times 145\\,\\mathrm{A} \\approx 100458.84\\,\\mathrm{VA}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the sum of the squares of the real and reactive powers. This quantity is the square of the fundamental apparent power, $\\lvert S_1\\rvert^2$.\n$$P^2 + Q^2 = (85000\\,\\mathrm{W})^2 + (45000\\,\\mathrm{VAr})^2$$\n$$P^2 + Q^2 = 7.225 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{W^2} + 2.025 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{VAr^2} = 9.25 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{VA^2}$$\n\nNow, we can compute the distortion power $D$.\n$$D = \\sqrt{\\lvert S\\rvert^2 - (P^2 + Q^2)}$$\n$$D = \\sqrt{(100458.84\\,\\mathrm{VA})^2 - (9.25 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{VA^2})}$$\n$$D = \\sqrt{1.0091971... \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{VA^2} - 0.925 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{VA^2}}$$\n$$D = \\sqrt{0.0841971... \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{VA^2}} = \\sqrt{8.41971... \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{VA^2}}$$\n$$D \\approx 29016.749\\,\\mathrm{VA}$$\n\nThe problem requires the result in kVA, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$D = 29.016749\\,\\mathrm{kVA}$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$D \\approx 29.02\\,\\mathrm{kVA}$$\n\n**Physical Implications of Distortion Power**\n\nA non-zero distortion power $D$ is a direct consequence of the non-sinusoidal nature of the load current drawn by the adjustable-speed drive. The problem states the source voltage is sinusoidal. Therefore, $D$ arises solely from the current harmonics.\n\nThe total RMS current $I_{\\mathrm{L}}$ is composed of a fundamental component ($I_1$) and harmonic components ($I_h = \\sqrt{I_2^2 + I_3^2 + \\dots}$), such that $I_{\\mathrm{L}}^2 = I_1^2 + I_h^2$. Since the voltage is sinusoidal, only the fundamental current component $I_1$ can contribute to real power $P$ and fundamental reactive power $Q$. The harmonic currents $I_h$, reacting against the fundamental voltage, contribute neither to $P$ nor to $Q$. However, these harmonic currents do contribute to the total RMS current $I_{\\mathrm{L}}$.\n\nThe distortion power $D$ is a measure of the power associated with these harmonic currents. Specifically, $D = \\sqrt{3} V_{\\mathrm{LL}} I_h$. A non-zero $D$ indicates that the system carries current components that do not transfer useful power. These harmonic currents cause additional resistive heating losses ($I^2R$ losses) in all series elements of the power system, such as transformers, transmission lines, and generator windings. This leads to reduced overall system efficiency, requires oversizing of equipment to handle the higher total RMS current, and can potentially distort the supply voltage and interfere with other connected equipment.",
