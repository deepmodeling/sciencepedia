The description of the capacitor current as a symmetric triangular waveform is a standard and valid approximation for a buck converter in continuous conduction mode where $i_C(t) = i_L(t) - I_{out}$. The inductor current $i_L(t)$ is approximately a triangular wave centered on the average output current $I_{out}$, making $i_C(t)$ a triangular wave centered on zero. The principles cited ($i=C\\,dv/dt$ and the definition of RMS) are fundamental to circuit theory and signal analysis.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed.

The information provided is sufficient to uniquely determine the two requested quantities, $\\Delta v_C$ and $I_\\mathrm{RMS}$, through direct application of calculus.\n3.  **Consistency**: The givens are self-consistent. The problem states that the current has a zero average. We can verify this: the integral of $i_C(t)$ over $[0, T]$ corresponds to the net area under the waveform. For the interval $[0, T/2]$, the area is that of a triangle from $0$ to $T/4$ (negative area) and a triangle from $T/4$ to $T/2$ (positive area). The areas are $-\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{T}{4})\\hat{I}$ and $+\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{T}{4})\\hat{I}$, summing to zero. By symmetry, the integral over $[T/2, T]$ is also zero. Thus, the total integral over $[0, T]$ is zero, confirming a zero average value and satisfying the principle of capacitor charge balance over a steady-state period. The function is continuous at $t=T/2$.\n4.  **Objectivity and Clarity**: The problem is stated using precise, objective mathematical and technical language. There are no ambiguities in the definitions or requirements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, self-consistent, well-posed, and an objective application of fundamental principles in power electronics. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivations\n\nThe solution will be derived in two parts, corresponding to the two quantities requested.\n\n**1. Peak-to-Peak Capacitor Voltage Ripple, $\\Delta v_{C}$**\n\nThe relationship between capacitor current $i_{C}(t)$ and capacitor voltage $v_{C}(t)$ is given by the constitutive law:\n$$\ni_{C}(t) = C\\,\\dfrac{dv_{C}(t)}{dt}\n$$\nThis implies that the change in capacitor voltage over a time interval is proportional to the integral of the capacitor current over that same interval:\n$$\nv_{C}(t_2) - v_{C}(t_1) = \\dfrac{1}{C}\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} i_{C}(\\tau)\\,d\\tau\n$$\nThe peak-to-peak voltage ripple, $\\Delta v_{C}$, is the difference between the maximum and minimum voltage values over one switching period, $\\Delta v_{C} = v_{C,max} - v_{C,min}$. The extrema of $v_{C}(t)$ occur when its derivative is zero, which means $\\dfrac{dv_{C}(t)}{dt}=0$. From the constitutive law, this happens when $i_{C}(t)=0$.\n\nWe locate the zero-crossings of $i_{C}(t)$:\n- For $t \\in [0, T/2)$, $i_{C}(t) = -\\hat{I}+\\dfrac{4\\hat{I}}{T}\\,t = 0 \\implies \\dfrac{4\\hat{I}}{T}\\,t = \\hat{I} \\implies t = \\dfrac{T}{4}$.\n- For $t \\in [T/2, T)$, $i_{C}(t) = \\hat{I}-\\dfrac{4\\hat{I}}{T}\\,\\bigl(t-\\dfrac{T}{2}\\bigr) = 0 \\implies \\hat{I} = \\dfrac{4\\hat{I}}{T}\\,\\bigl(t-\\dfrac{T}{2}\\bigr) \\implies \\dfrac{T}{4} = t-\\dfrac{T}{2} \\implies t = \\dfrac{3T}{4}$.\n\nThe current $i_{C}(t)$ is negative for $t \\in [0, T/4)$ and positive for $t \\in (T/4, 3T/4)$. Consequently, the voltage $v_{C}(t)$ decreases to a minimum at $t=T/4$ and then increases to a maximum at $t=3T/4$.\n\nThe peak-to-peak voltage ripple is therefore the total change in voltage from $t=T/4$ to $t=3T/4$:\n$$\n\\Delta v_{C} = v_{C}\\left(\\frac{3T}{4}\\right) - v_{C}\\left(\\frac{T}{4}\\right) = \\dfrac{1}{C}\\int_{T/4}^{3T/4} i_{C}(t)\\,dt\n$$\nThis integral represents the total charge accumulated by the capacitor during the interval when the current is positive. Geometrically, this is the area under the $i_{C}(t)$ curve from $t=T/4$ to $t=3T/4$. The shape is a triangle with base width $b = \\dfrac{3T}{4} - \\dfrac{T}{4} = \\dfrac{T}{2}$ and height $h = \\hat{I}$ (occurring at $t=T/2$).\n\nThe area of this triangle is:\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\dfrac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\dfrac{1}{2} \\times \\dfrac{T}{2} \\times \\hat{I} = \\dfrac{\\hat{I}T}{4}\n$$\nSubstituting this area into the expression for $\\Delta v_{C}$:\n$$\n\\Delta v_{C} = \\dfrac{1}{C} \\left( \\dfrac{\\hat{I}T}{4} \\right) = \\dfrac{\\hat{I}T}{4C}\n$$\n\n**2. RMS Ripple Current of the Capacitor, $I_{\\mathrm{RMS}}$**\n\nThe RMS value of the capacitor current is defined as:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{RMS}} = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T}i_{C}^{2}(t)\\,dt}\n$$\nWe first compute the integral of $i_{C}^{2}(t)$ over one period. Due to the symmetry of the waveform, the integral over the first half-period, $[0, T/2]$, is identical to the integral over the second half-period, $[T/2, T]$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T} i_{C}^{2}(t)\\,dt = 2 \\int_{0}^{T/2} i_{C}^{2}(t)\\,dt\n$$\nFor the interval $t \\in [0, T/2]$, we have $i_{C}(t) = -\\hat{I}+\\dfrac{4\\hat{I}}{T}\\,t$.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T/2} i_{C}^{2}(t)\\,dt = \\int_{0}^{T/2} \\left(-\\hat{I}+\\dfrac{4\\hat{I}}{T}\\,t\\right)^2 dt = \\hat{I}^2 \\int_{0}^{T/2} \\left(-1+\\dfrac{4}{T}\\,t\\right)^2 dt\n$$\nExpanding the squared term:\n$$\n\\hat{I}^2 \\int_{0}^{T/2} \\left(1 - \\dfrac{8}{T}\\,t + \\dfrac{16}{T^2}\\,t^2\\right) dt\n$$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$\n= \\hat{I}^2 \\left[ t - \\dfrac{8}{T}\\dfrac{t^2}{2} + \\dfrac{16}{T^2}\\dfrac{t^3}{3} \\right]_{0}^{T/2}\n$$\n$$\n= \\hat{I}^2 \\left[ \\left(\\dfrac{T}{2}\\right) - \\dfrac{4}{T}\\left(\\dfrac{T}{2}\\right)^2 + \\dfrac{16}{3T^2}\\left(\\dfrac{T}{2}\\right)^3 - 0 \\right]\n$$\n$$\n= \\hat{I}^2 \\left[ \\dfrac{T}{2} - \\dfrac{4}{T}\\dfrac{T^2}{4} + \\dfrac{16}{3T^2}\\dfrac{T^3}{8} \\right]\n$$\n$$\n= \\hat{I}^2 \\left[ \\dfrac{T}{2} - T + \\dfrac{2T}{3} \\right] = \\hat{I}^2 \\left[ -\\dfrac{T}{2} + \\dfrac{2T}{3} \\right] = \\hat{I}^2 \\left[ \\dfrac{-3T+4T}{6} \\right] = \\hat{I}^2 \\dfrac{T}{6}\n$$\nThe total integral over one period is:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T} i_{C}^{2}(t)\\,dt = 2 \\times \\left(\\hat{I}^2 \\dfrac{T}{6}\\right) = \\dfrac{\\hat{I}^2 T}{3}\n$$\nNow, substitute this into the definition of the RMS value:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{RMS}}^2 = \\dfrac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T}i_{C}^{2}(t)\\,dt = \\dfrac{1}{T} \\left( \\dfrac{\\hat{I}^2 T}{3} \\right) = \\dfrac{\\hat{I}^2}{3}\n$$\nTaking the square root gives the final expression for the RMS current:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{RMS}} = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\hat{I}^2}{3}} = \\dfrac{\\hat{I}}{\\sqrt{3}}\n$$\nThis is the standard result for the RMS value of a symmetric triangular waveform with zero mean and peak value $\\hat{I}$.",

Therefore, the charging begins in the constant current mode, where the current is $i(t) = I_{\\text{lim}}$.\n\nThis phase continues until the capacitor voltage $v_{C}(t)$ rises to a transition voltage, $V_{\\text{trans}}$, at which the ohmic current naturally equals the current limit:\n$$ \\frac{V_{\\text{s}} - V_{\\text{trans}}}{R} = I_{\\text{lim}} $$\nSolving for $V_{\\text{trans}}$ gives:\n$$ V_{\\text{trans}} = V_{\\text{s}} - R I_{\\text{lim}} $$\nThe duration of this phase, $t_1$, can be found using the capacitor charge balance principle. The capacitor voltage increases from $v_{C}(0)=0$ to $v_{C}(t_1)=V_{\\text{trans}}$ with a constant current $I_{\\text{lim}}$.\n$$ \\int_{0}^{t_1} i(\\tau)\\,d\\tau = C \\big( v_{C}(t_1) - v_{C}(0) \\big) $$\n$$ \\int_{0}^{t_1} I_{\\text{lim}}\\,d\\tau = C (V_{\\text{trans}} - 0) $$\n$$ I_{\\text{lim}} t_{1} = C V_{\\text{trans}} $$\n$$ t_1 = \\frac{C V_{\\text{trans}}}{I_{\\text{lim}}} = \\frac{C(V_{\\text{s}} - R I_{\\text{lim}})}{I_{\\text{lim}}} $$\nWe must verify that the target voltage $V_{\\text{dc}}$ is not reached within this phase. This requires checking if $V_{\\text{dc}} > V_{\\text{trans}}$.\nUsing the given values: $V_{\\text{trans}} = 800\\,\\text{V} - (5\\,\\Omega \\times 50\\,\\text{A}) = 800\\,\\text{V} - 250\\,\\text{V} = 550\\,\\text{V}$.\nSince $V_{\\text{dc}} = 700\\,\\text{V}$, we have $V_{\\text{dc}} > V_{\\text{trans}}$, confirming that the process must enter a second phase.\n\nPhase 2: Ohmic (RC) Charging\nThis phase starts at time $t_1$ with the capacitor voltage at $V_{\\text{trans}}$. For $t > t_1$, the condition $\\frac{V_{\\text{s}}-v_{C}(t)}{R} < I_{\\text{lim}}$ holds, and the PWM regulation becomes inactive. The charging current is then determined by Ohm's law:\n$$ i(t) = \\frac{V_{\\text{s}} - v_{C}(t)}{R} $$\nCombining this with the capacitor's constitutive law, $i(t) = C \\frac{dv_{C}}{dt}$, we get the governing differential equation for this phase:\n$$ C \\frac{dv_{C}}{dt} = \\frac{V_{\\text{s}} - v_{C}}{R} $$\nTo find the duration of this phase, $t_2$, we can separate variables and integrate. The voltage changes from $V_{\\text{trans}}$ at time $t_1$ to $V_{\\text{dc}}$ at time $t_{\\text{total}} = t_1 + t_2$.\n$$ \\frac{dv_C}{V_{\\text{s}} - v_C} = \\frac{dt}{RC} $$\nIntegrating over the phase from its start ($t=t_1, v_C=V_{\\text{trans}}$) to its end ($t=t_{\\text{total}}, v_C=V_{\\text{dc}}$):\n$$ \\int_{V_{\\text{trans}}}^{V_{\\text{dc}}} \\frac{1}{V_{\\text{s}} - v_C}\\,dv_C = \\int_{t_1}^{t_{\\text{total}}} \\frac{1}{RC}\\,dt $$\n$$ \\Big[ -\\ln(V_{\\text{s}} - v_C) \\Big]_{V_{\\text{trans}}}^{V_{\\text{dc}}} = \\frac{1}{RC} (t_{\\text{total}} - t_1) $$\n$$ -\\ln(V_{\\text{s}} - V_{\\text{dc}}) + \\ln(V_{\\text{s}} - V_{\\text{trans}}) = \\frac{t_2}{RC} $$\nwhere $t_2 = t_{\\text{total}} - t_1$.\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{\\text{s}} - V_{\\text{trans}}}{V_{\\text{s}} - V_{\\text{dc}}}\\right) = \\frac{t_2}{RC} $$\nSolving for $t_2$:\n$$ t_2 = RC \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{\\text{s}} - V_{\\text{trans}}}{V_{\\text{s}} - V_{\\text{dc}}}\\right) $$\nSubstituting $V_{\\text{trans}} = V_{\\text{s}} - R I_{\\text{lim}}$, we get $V_{\\text{s}} - V_{\\text{trans}} = R I_{\\text{lim}}$.\n$$ t_2 = RC \\ln\\left(\\frac{R I_{\\text{lim}}}{V_{\\text{s}} - V_{\\text{dc}}}\\right) $$\n\nTotal Time\nThe total time to reach $V_{\\text{dc}}$ is the sum of the durations of the two phases, $t_{\\text{total}} = t_1 + t_2$.\n$$ t_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{C(V_{\\text{s}} - R I_{\\text{lim}})}{I_{\\text{lim}}} + RC \\ln\\left(\\frac{R I_{\\text{lim}}}{V_{\\text{s}} - V_{\\text{dc}}}\\right) $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$V_{\\text{s}}=800\\,\\text{V}$, $V_{\\text{dc}}=700\\,\\text{V}$, $R=5\\,\\Omega$, $I_{\\text{lim}}=50\\,\\text{A}$, $C=8\\,\\text{mF} = 8 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{F}$.\n\nFirst, calculate $t_1$:\n$$ t_1 = \\frac{(8 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{F})(800\\,\\text{V} - 5\\,\\Omega \\times 50\\,\\text{A})}{50\\,\\text{A}} = \\frac{(8 \\times 10^{-3})(800 - 250)}{50}\\,\\text{s} $$\n$$ t_1 = \\frac{(8 \\times 10^{-3})(550)}{50}\\,\\text{s} = \\frac{4.4}{50}\\,\\text{s} = 0.088\\,\\text{s} $$\nNext, calculate $t_2$:\n$$ t_2 = (5\\,\\Omega)(8 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{F}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{5\\,\\Omega \\times 50\\,\\text{A}}{800\\,\\text{V} - 700\\,\\text{V}}\\right) $$\n$$ t_2 = 0.04\\,\\text{s} \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{250}{100}\\right) = 0.04 \\ln(2.5)\\,\\text{s} $$\nUsing the value $\\ln(2.5) \\approx 0.91629$:\n$$ t_2 \\approx 0.04 \\times 0.91629\\,\\text{s} \\approx 0.0366516\\,\\text{s} $$\nFinally, the total time is:\n$$ t_{\\text{total}} = t_1 + t_2 \\approx 0.088\\,\\text{s} + 0.0366516\\,\\text{s} \\approx 0.1246516\\,\\text{s} $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested gives $0.1247\\,\\text{s}$.",
