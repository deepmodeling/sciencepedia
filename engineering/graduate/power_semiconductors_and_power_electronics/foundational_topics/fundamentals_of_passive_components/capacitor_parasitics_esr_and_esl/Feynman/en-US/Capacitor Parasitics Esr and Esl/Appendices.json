The solution will proceed by first determining the operating parameters of the converter, then deriving the contribution of each parasitic element (capacitance, ESR, ESL) to the total output voltage ripple, and finally solving for the maximum ESR value that meets the specification.\n\nFirst, we determine the fundamental operating parameters of the buck converter.\nThe switching period $T_s$ is the inverse of the switching frequency $f_s$:\n$$T_s = \\frac{1}{f_s} = \\frac{1}{500 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{Hz}} = 2 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$$\nFor an ideal buck converter operating in continuous conduction mode (CCM), the duty ratio $D$ is the ratio of the output voltage $V_o$ to the input voltage $V_{\\mathrm{in}}$:\n$$D = \\frac{V_o}{V_{\\mathrm{in}}} = \\frac{12\\,\\mathrm{V}}{48\\,\\mathrm{V}} = 0.25$$\nThe duration for which the high-side switch is on, $T_{on}$, and the low-side switch is on, $T_{off}$, are given by:\n$$T_{on} = D \\cdot T_s = 0.25 \\cdot (2 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}) = 0.5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$$\n$$T_{off} = (1-D) \\cdot T_s = (1 - 0.25) \\cdot (2 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}) = 1.5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 1.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$$\n\nThe total output voltage ripple $V_{\\mathrm{pp,tot}}$ is specified as the arithmetic sum of the peak-to-peak contributions from the capacitance ($V_{\\mathrm{pp,C}}$), the ESR ($V_{\\mathrm{pp,ESR}}$), and the ESL ($V_{\\mathrm{pp,ESL}}$):\n$$V_{\\mathrm{pp,tot}} = V_{\\mathrm{pp,C}} + V_{\\mathrm{pp,ESR}} + V_{\\mathrm{pp,ESL}}$$\nThe problem states that the capacitor current, $i_C(t)$, can be modeled as the zero-average AC component of the inductor current.

A solution will be derived from first principles.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires determining the maximum allowable equivalent series inductance (ESL) of a DC-link capacitor bank, denoted as $L_{\\mathrm{cap,max}}$. The primary physical principle governing the transient voltage overshoot is Faraday's law of induction.\n\nDuring the turn-off transient of a power semiconductor, the current through the DC-link commutation loop changes rapidly. This loop includes the DC-link capacitor bank, the busbars, and the semiconductor module itself. The problem states that these elements possess stray inductances that are effectively in series for this fast transient. The total loop inductance, $L_{\\mathrm{loop}}$, is therefore the sum of the individual inductances:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{loop}} = L_{\\mathrm{busbar}} + L_{\\mathrm{module}} + L_{\\mathrm{cap}}$$\nwhere $L_{\\mathrm{cap}}$ is the ESL of the capacitor bank.\n\nAccording to Faraday's law, a changing current, $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}i}{\\mathrm{d}t}$, through this total inductance induces a voltage overshoot, $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{overshoot}}$, across the loop:\n$$\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{overshoot}} = L_{\\mathrm{loop}} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}i}{\\mathrm{d}t}$$\n\nThe problem imposes a constraint on this voltage overshoot: it must not exceed $2\\%$ of the nominal DC bus voltage, $V_{\\mathrm{bus}}$. We can calculate this maximum allowable overshoot, $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{max}}$:\n$$\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{max}} = 0.02 \\times V_{\\mathrm{bus}}$$\nSubstituting the given value $V_{\\mathrm{bus}} = 800\\,\\mathrm{V}$:\n$$\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{max}} = 0.02 \\times 800\\,\\mathrm{V} = 16\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n\nTo adhere to this constraint, the total loop inductance, $L_{\\mathrm{loop}}$, must not exceed a certain maximum value, $L_{\\mathrm{loop,max}}$. We can find this value by rearranging the induction equation:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{loop,max}} = \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{max}}}{\\frac{\\mathrm{d}i}{\\mathrm{d}t}}$$\n\nThe given current slew rate is $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}i}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 280\\,\\mathrm{A}/\\mu\\mathrm{s}$. For dimensional consistency in SI units, we must convert microseconds ($\\mu\\mathrm{s}$) to seconds (s):\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}i}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 280\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{A}}{1 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}} = 280 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{A/s}$$\n\nNow, we can calculate $L_{\\mathrm{loop,max}}$:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{loop,max}} = \\frac{16\\,\\mathrm{V}}{280 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{A/s}} \\approx 5.71428 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{H}$$\nSince $1\\,\\mathrm{nH} = 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{H}$, we can express this inductance in nanohenries:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{loop,max}} \\approx 57.1428\\,\\mathrm{nH}$$\n\nThis total maximum inductance is composed of contributions from the busbar, the module, and the capacitor bank. The maximum allowable ESL for the capacitor bank, $L_{\\mathrm{cap,max}}$, is the remaining portion of the total inductance budget:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{cap,max}} = L_{\\mathrm{loop,max}} - L_{\\mathrm{busbar}} - L_{\\mathrm{module}}$$\n\nSubstituting the given component inductances, $L_{\\mathrm{busbar}} = 18\\,\\mathrm{nH}$ and $L_{\\mathrm{module}} = 12\\,\\mathrm{nH}$:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{cap,max}} \\approx 57.1428\\,\\mathrm{nH} - 18\\,\\mathrm{nH} - 12\\,\\mathrm{nH}$$\n$$L_{\\mathrm{cap,max}} \\approx 57.1428\\,\\mathrm{nH} - 30\\,\\mathrm{nH}$$\n$$L_{\\mathrm{cap,max}} \\approx 27.1428\\,\\mathrm{nH}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the result to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$L_{\\mathrm{cap,max}} \\approx 27.1\\,\\mathrm{nH}$$\nThis is the maximum allowable effective ESL for the entire capacitor bank to ensure the voltage overshoot remains within the specified safety margin.",

The voltage and current are approximately:\n$$v_C(t) \\approx V_0 \\exp(-\\alpha t) \\cos(\\omega_0 t)$$\n$$i(t) = -C\\frac{dv_C}{dt} \\approx V_0 C \\omega_0 \\exp(-\\alpha t) \\sin(\\omega_0 t)$$\nSubstituting these into the energy expression:\n$$W_{\\text{stored}}(t) \\approx \\frac{1}{2}L_{\\mathrm{ESL}}(V_0 C \\omega_0 \\exp(-\\alpha t) \\sin(\\omega_0 t))^2 + \\frac{1}{2}C(V_0 \\exp(-\\alpha t) \\cos(\\omega_0 t))^2$$\nUsing $\\omega_0^2 = 1/(L_{\\mathrm{ESL}}C)$, the term $L_{\\mathrm{ESL}}(C\\omega_0)^2$ simplifies to $L_{\\mathrm{ESL}}C^2 / (L_{\\mathrm{ESL}}C) = C$.\n$$W_{\\text{stored}}(t) \\approx \\frac{1}{2}C V_0^2 \\exp(-2\\alpha t) \\sin^2(\\omega_0 t) + \\frac{1}{2}C V_0^2 \\exp(-2\\alpha t) \\cos^2(\\omega_0 t)$$\n$$W_{\\text{stored}}(t) \\approx \\frac{1}{2}C V_0^2 \\exp(-2\\alpha t) (\\sin^2(\\omega_0 t) + \\cos^2(\\omega_0 t)) = W_0 \\exp(-2\\alpha t)$$\nwhere $W_0 = \\frac{1}{2}C V_0^2$ is the initial stored energy. This is the energy envelope, which varies slowly.\n\nThe energy dissipated in one cycle of period $T = 2\\pi/\\omega_0$ is the change in stored energy over that period:\n$$W_{\\text{dissipated per cycle}} = W_{\\text{stored}}(t) - W_{\\text{stored}}(t+T) = W_0 \\exp(-2\\alpha t) - W_0 \\exp(-2\\alpha(t+T))$$\n$$W_{\\text{dissipated per cycle}} = W_{\\text{stored}}(t) \\left( 1 - \\exp(-2\\alpha T) \\right)$$\nFor weak damping, the envelope varies slowly, meaning $2\\alpha T \\ll 1$. We use the Taylor approximation $\\exp(-x) \\approx 1-x$ for small $x$.\n$$W_{\\text{dissipated per cycle}} \\approx W_{\\text{stored}}(t) (1 - (1-2\\alpha T)) = 2\\alpha T W_{\\text{stored}}(t)$$\nNow we substitute this into the definition of $Q$:\n$$Q = 2\\pi \\frac{W_{\\text{stored}}(t)}{W_{\\text{dissipated per cycle}}} \\approx \\frac{2\\pi}{2\\alpha T} = \\frac{2\\pi}{2\\alpha (2\\pi/\\omega_0)} = \\frac{\\omega_0}{2\\alpha}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\omega_0$ and $\\alpha$:\n$$Q = \\frac{1/\\sqrt{L_{\\mathrm{ESL}}C}}{R_{\\mathrm{ESR}}/L_{\\mathrm{ESL}}} = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{ESL}}}{R_{\\mathrm{ESR}}\\sqrt{L_{\\mathrm{ESL}}C}}$$\n$$Q = \\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{ESR}}}\\sqrt{\\frac{L_{\\mathrm{ESL}}}{C}}$$\n\n**2. Derivation of the Energy Decay Time $\\tau_E$**\n\nWe use the continuous-time energy balance, which states that the rate of change of stored energy is equal to the power dissipated by the resistor:\n$$\\frac{dW_{\\text{stored}}}{dt} = -P_{\\text{dissipated}} = -R_{\\mathrm{ESR}}i(t)^2$$\nTo find the decay time of the energy envelope, we average this equation over one cycle, invoking the assumption that the energy envelope changes slowly. Let $W(t)$ be the energy envelope $W_0 \\exp(-2\\alpha t)$.\n$$\\frac{dW(t)}{dt} = \\langle -R_{\\mathrm{ESR}}i(t)^2 \\rangle_T$$\nThe time average of the squared current over one cycle is:\n$$\\langle i(t)^2 \\rangle_T \\approx \\langle (V_0 C \\omega_0 \\exp(-\\alpha t))^2 \\sin^2(\\omega_0 t) \\rangle_T$$\nSince the envelope is slow, we treat $\\exp(-\\alpha t)$ as constant over the cycle:\n$$\\langle i(t)^2 \\rangle_T \\approx (V_0 C \\omega_0 \\exp(-\\alpha t))^2 \\langle \\sin^2(\\omega_0 t) \\rangle_T = \\frac{1}{2} (V_0 C \\omega_0 \\exp(-\\alpha t))^2$$\nThe total stored energy can be expressed as the peak energy, e.g., $W(t) = \\frac{1}{2}C (V_0 \\exp(-\\alpha t))^2$. The peak current is $I_{peak}(t) = V_0 C \\omega_0 \\exp(-\\alpha t)$.\nThus, $\\langle i(t)^2 \\rangle_T \\approx \\frac{1}{2} I_{peak}(t)^2$.\nThe energy balance becomes:\n$$\\frac{dW(t)}{dt} \\approx -R_{\\mathrm{ESR}} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} I_{peak}(t)^2 \\right)$$\nThe energy envelope can also be written in terms of peak current: $W(t) = \\frac{1}{2}L_{\\mathrm{ESL}}I_{peak}(t)^2$.\n$$\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}L_{\\mathrm{ESL}}I_{peak}(t)^2\\right) \\approx -\\frac{1}{2}R_{\\mathrm{ESR}}I_{peak}(t)^2$$\nLet $Y(t) = I_{peak}(t)^2$. The equation simplifies to a first-order ODE for $Y(t)$:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{ESL}}\\frac{dY}{dt} = -R_{\\mathrm{ESR}}Y \\implies \\frac{dY}{dt} = -\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{ESR}}}{L_{\\mathrm{ESL}}} Y$$\nThe solution is of the form $Y(t) = Y_0 \\exp(-t/\\tau_E)$, where the time constant $\\tau_E$ is the characteristic time for the energy to decay. By comparison, we find:\n$$\\tau_E = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{ESL}}}{R_{\\mathrm{ESR}}}$$\nThis is the characteristic time for the stored electromagnetic energy to decay to $1/\\exp(1)$ of its initial value.\n\n### Numerical Computations\n\nGiven values:\n$L_{\\mathrm{ESL}} = 20 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{H}$\n$R_{\\mathrm{ESR}} = 5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\Omega$\n$C = 10 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{F}$\n\n**Quality Factor $Q$:**\n$$Q = \\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{ESR}}}\\sqrt{\\frac{L_{\\mathrm{ESL}}}{C}} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{-3}} \\sqrt{\\frac{20 \\times 10^{-9}}{10 \\times 10^{-6}}} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{-3}} \\sqrt{2 \\times 10^{-3}}$$\n$$Q \\approx 200 \\times 0.04472136 = 8.94427...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $Q = 8.944$.\n\n**Energy Decay Time $\\tau_E$:**\n$$\\tau_E = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{ESL}}}{R_{\\mathrm{ESR}}} = \\frac{20 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{H}}{5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\Omega} = 4 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nThe problem requests the time in microseconds ($\\mu\\mathrm{s}$).\n$$\\tau_E = 4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the decay time is $4.000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nThe final answer is the ordered pair $(Q, \\tau_E)$.",
