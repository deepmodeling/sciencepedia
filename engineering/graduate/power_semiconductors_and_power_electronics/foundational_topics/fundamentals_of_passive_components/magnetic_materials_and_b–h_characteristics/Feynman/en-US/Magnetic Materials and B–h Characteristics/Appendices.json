The toroid has mean magnetic path length $l_{m}$, uniform cross-sectional area $A_{c}$, and exhibits negligible fringing and negligible interlaminar eddy currents at the test frequency. A drive winding of $N_{p}$ turns is excited by a sinusoidal current produced by a voltage source feeding the winding in series with a non-inductive shunt resistor of resistance $R_{\\text{sh}}$. A second, separate sense winding of $N_{s}$ turns is wound on the same core and left open-circuited, with its differential voltage measured by a high-impedance probe on a Digital Storage Oscilloscope (DSO). The shunt resistor voltage is also measured.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is well-posed, scientifically grounded in the principles of electromagnetism, and provides a complete and consistent set of data for analysis. We can proceed with the solution.\n\nThe task is to derive expressions for the magnetic field intensity $H(t)$ and magnetic flux density $B(t)$ from the provided measurements, calculate their peak values $H_{\\text{pk}}$ and $B_{\\text{pk}}$, and finally compute the dynamic ratio $\\mu_{\\text{dyn}} = B_{\\text{pk}} / H_{\\text{pk}}$.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the magnetic field intensity $H(t)$. We start from Ampere’s circuital law, which in its integral form is given by:\n$$\n\\oint \\mathbf{H} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = I_{\\text{enc}}\n$$\nFor the toroidal core, we take the integration path to be the mean magnetic path length $l_m$. The problem states that $H(t)$ is spatially uniform along this path. The enclosed current, $I_{\\text{enc}}$, is the total current flowing through the area bounded by the path. This is the current in the primary winding, $i_p(t)$, multiplied by the number of turns $N_p$. Therefore, $I_{\\text{enc}} = N_p i_p(t)$. Ampere's law simplifies to:\n$$\nH(t) l_m = N_p i_p(t)\n$$\nSolving for $H(t)$ gives:\n$$\nH(t) = \\frac{N_p}{l_m} i_p(t)\n$$\nThe primary current $i_p(t)$ is not measured directly but is determined from the voltage $v_{\\text{sh}}(t)$ across the non-inductive shunt resistor of resistance $R_{\\text{sh}}$. According to Ohm's law:\n$$\ni_p(t) = \\frac{v_{\\text{sh}}(t)}{R_{\\text{sh}}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $H(t)$:\n$$\nH(t) = \\frac{N_p}{l_m R_{\\text{sh}}} v_{\\text{sh}}(t)\n$$\nThe problem provides the measured shunt voltage as $v_{\\text{sh}}(t) = 0.050 \\sin(\\omega t) \\text{ V}$. Let's denote the peak shunt voltage as $V_{\\text{sh,pk}} = 0.050$ V. The expression for $H(t)$ becomes:\n$$\nH(t) = \\frac{N_p V_{\\text{sh,pk}}}{l_m R_{\\text{sh}}} \\sin(\\omega t)\n$$\nThe peak magnetic field intensity, $H_{\\text{pk}}$, is the amplitude of this sinusoidal function:\n$$\nH_{\\text{pk}} = \\frac{N_p V_{\\text{sh,pk}}}{l_m R_{\\text{sh}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values: $N_p = 100$, $V_{\\text{sh,pk}} = 0.050 \\text{ V}$, $l_m = 0.10 \\text{ m}$, and $R_{\\text{sh}} = 0.50 \\, \\Omega$.\n$$\nH_{\\text{pk}} = \\frac{100 \\cdot 0.050}{0.10 \\cdot 0.50} = \\frac{5}{0.05} = 100 \\, \\text{A/m}\n$$\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the magnetic flux density $B(t)$. We start from Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction. The voltage induced in the sense winding, $v_s(t)$, is given by the rate of change of magnetic flux $\\Phi(t)$ through the coil:\n$$\nv_s(t) = N_s \\frac{d\\Phi(t)}{dt}\n$$\nThe problem assumes the magnetic flux density $B(t)$ is spatially uniform over the core's cross-sectional area $A_c$. The total magnetic flux is thus $\\Phi(t) = B(t) A_c$. Substituting this into Faraday's law:\n$$\nv_s(t) = N_s \\frac{d(B(t)A_c)}{dt} = N_s A_c \\frac{dB(t)}{dt}\n$$\nTo find $B(t)$, we must integrate this equation with respect to time:\n$$\nB(t) = \\frac{1}{N_s A_c} \\int v_s(t) dt\n$$\nThe problem provides the measured sense voltage as $v_s(t) = 3.7699 \\cos(\\omega t) \\text{ V}$. Let's denote the peak sense voltage as $V_{\\text{s,pk}} = 3.7699$ V.\n$$\nB(t) = \\frac{1}{N_s A_c} \\int V_{\\text{s,pk}} \\cos(\\omega t) dt = \\frac{V_{\\text{s,pk}}}{N_s A_c} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\omega} \\sin(\\omega t) \\right) + C\n$$\nThe constant of integration $C$ represents a DC bias in the magnetic flux density. For a symmetric AC excitation in steady state, this DC component is zero. Thus, we set $C=0$.\n$$\nB(t) = \\frac{V_{\\text{s,pk}}}{N_s A_c \\omega} \\sin(\\omega t)\n$$\nWe observe that both $H(t)$ and $B(t)$ are sinusoidal functions of time and are in phase with each other. This indicates that, under these specific test conditions, the material behaves as a linear, lossless medium, where $B(t) = \\mu H(t)$.\n\nThe peak magnetic flux density, $B_{\\text{pk}}$, is the amplitude of this sinusoidal function:\n$$\nB_{\\text{pk}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{s,pk}}}{N_s A_c \\omega}\n$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values: $V_{\\text{s,pk}} = 3.7699 \\text{ V}$, $N_s = 50$, $A_c = 1.20 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ m}^2$, and $\\omega = 2\\pi f = 2\\pi \\cdot 1000 \\text{ rad/s}$.\n$$\nB_{\\text{pk}} = \\frac{3.7699}{50 \\cdot (1.20 \\times 10^{-4}) \\cdot (2\\pi \\cdot 1000)} = \\frac{3.7699}{50 \\cdot (1.20 \\times 10^{-4}) \\cdot 2000\\pi}\n$$\n$$\nB_{\\text{pk}} = \\frac{3.7699}{(6.0 \\times 10^{-3}) \\cdot 2000\\pi} = \\frac{3.7699}{12\\pi} \\, \\text{T}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the dynamic ratio $\\mu_{\\text{dyn}} = B_{\\text{pk}} / H_{\\text{pk}}$, which represents the amplitude permeability under these conditions.\n$$\n\\mu_{\\text{dyn}} = \\frac{B_{\\text{pk}}}{H_{\\text{pk}}} = \\frac{\\left( \\dfrac{3.7699}{12\\pi} \\right)}{100} = \\frac{3.7699}{1200\\pi} \\, \\text{H/m}\n$$\nNow we compute the numerical value:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\text{dyn}} = \\frac{3.7699}{1200\\pi} \\approx \\frac{3.7699}{3769.911...} \\approx 0.0009999974... \\, \\text{H/m}\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\mu_{\\text{dyn}} \\approx 1.000 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{H/m}\n$$",

All physical quantities and their units are correct.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined.

The parameters are physically realistic for a ferrite-core inductor. The question is directly relevant to the topic of magnetic materials in power electronics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to compute the magnetizing current $I$ that produces a peak flux density $B_{\\text{pk}} = 1.50\\ \\text{T}$ in the core.\n\nFirst, we compare the target flux density $B_{\\text{pk}}$ with the knee flux density $B_{\\text{knee}}$.\nGiven $B_{\\text{pk}} = 1.50\\ \\text{T}$ and $B_{\\text{knee}} = 1.20\\ \\text{T}$, we observe that $B_{\\text{pk}} > B_{\\text{knee}}$. This indicates that the magnetic core is operating in the saturation region. Therefore, the second part of the provided B-H characteristic model must be used:\n$$B = B_{\\text{knee}} + \\mu_{0} (H - H_{\\text{knee}})$$\nWe need to find the magnetic field intensity $H_{\\text{pk}}$ corresponding to $B_{\\text{pk}}$. We can rearrange the equation to solve for $H$:\n$$H - H_{\\text{knee}} = \\frac{B - B_{\\text{knee}}}{\\mu_{0}}$$\n$$H = H_{\\text{knee}} + \\frac{B - B_{\\text{knee}}}{\\mu_{0}}$$\nAt the peak flux density, this becomes:\n$$H_{\\text{pk}} = H_{\\text{knee}} + \\frac{B_{\\text{pk}} - B_{\\text{knee}}}{\\mu_{0}}$$\nWe first need to calculate $H_{\\text{knee}}$. Using the provided definition, which corresponds to the field intensity at the edge of the linear region:\n$$H_{\\text{knee}} = \\frac{B_{\\text{knee}}}{\\mu_{0} \\mu_{\\text{lin}}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$H_{\\text{knee}} = \\frac{1.20}{(4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}) \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{3})} = \\frac{1.20}{2\\pi \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{600}{\\pi}\\ \\text{A}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$$\nNow, we can calculate $H_{\\text{pk}}$:\n$$H_{\\text{pk}} = \\frac{600}{\\pi} + \\frac{1.50 - 1.20}{4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}} = \\frac{600}{\\pi} + \\frac{0.30}{4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}} = \\frac{600}{\\pi} + \\frac{3 \\times 10^{6}}{4\\pi}$$\nTo combine these terms, we use a common denominator of $4\\pi$:\n$$H_{\\text{pk}} = \\frac{4 \\times 600}{4\\pi} + \\frac{3 \\times 10^{6}}{4\\pi} = \\frac{2400 + 3000000}{4\\pi} = \\frac{3002400}{4\\pi} = \\frac{750600}{\\pi}\\ \\text{A}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$$\nNext, we relate the magnetic field intensity $H$ to the magnetizing current $I$ using Ampere's Law for a toroid:\n$$Hl = NI$$\nSolving for the current $I$:\n$$I = \\frac{Hl}{N}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $H_{\\text{pk}}$ to find the required current:\n$$I = \\frac{H_{\\text{pk}} l}{N} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{750600}{\\pi}\\right) \\times (1.80 \\times 10^{-1})}{120}$$\n$$I = \\frac{750600}{\\pi} \\times \\frac{0.180}{120} = \\frac{750600}{\\pi} \\times 0.0015 = \\frac{1125.9}{\\pi}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value and round to four significant figures:\n$$I \\approx 358.3693\\ \\text{A}$$\n$$I \\approx 358.4\\ \\text{A}$$\n\n### Discussion on Saturation\nThe onset of saturation is characterized by a drastic reduction in a material's magnetic permeability. In the provided model, the permeability in the linear region is $\\mu_{\\text{lin}} \\mu_{0} = (5.0 \\times 10^{3}) \\mu_{0}$, whereas the *incremental* permeability in the saturation region ($dB/dH$) is just $\\mu_0$. This is a reduction by a factor of $\\mu_{\\text{lin}} = 5000$.\n\nThis dramatic change has profound implications for the magnetizing current. Let's calculate the current $I_{\\text{knee}}$ required to reach the onset of saturation at $B = B_{\\text{knee}}$:\n$$I_{\\text{knee}} = \\frac{H_{\\text{knee}} l}{N} = \\frac{(600/\\pi) \\times (1.80 \\times 10^{-1})}{120} = \\frac{0.9}{\\pi} \\approx 0.2865\\ \\text{A}$$\nTo increase the flux density from $B=0$ to $B_{\\text{knee}}=1.20\\ \\text{T}$, a current of only approximately $0.29\\ \\text{A}$ is required.\n\nIn contrast, to increase the flux density from $B_{\\text{knee}}=1.20\\ \\text{T}$ to $B_{\\text{pk}}=1.50\\ \\text{T}$ (an increase of only $0.30\\ \\text{T}$), the additional current required is:\n$$\\Delta I = I - I_{\\text{knee}} \\approx 358.4 - 0.2865 \\approx 358.1\\ \\text{A}$$\nThis calculation starkly reveals the effect of saturation: a small increase in flux density ($0.30\\ \\text{T}$) beyond the knee point demands an enormous increase in magnetizing current (over $358\\ \\text{A}$), which is over $1200$ times the current needed to reach the knee point itself.\n\nFor a power electronic inductor, inductance $L$ is a critical parameter, defined as the ratio of flux linkage $\\lambda = N\\Phi = NBA$ to current $I$. More precisely, $L = d\\lambda/di$. Since $B$ is a function of $H$ and $H$ is directly proportional to $I$ ($H=NI/l$), the inductance is proportional to the slope of the B-H curve.\n- In the linear region, $L$ is high and relatively constant.\n- In the saturation region, the slope $dB/dH$ drops to $\\mu_0$, causing the incremental inductance to plummet by a factor of $\\mu_{\\text{lin}} = 5000$.\n\nThis collapse in inductance is highly dangerous in a switched-mode power converter. The inductor's primary function is to limit the rate of change of current ($di/dt = V/L$). If $L$ suddenly drops to a very small value, the current can rise uncontrollably to destructive levels, leading to catastrophic failure of a switching semiconductor (e.g., a MOSFET or IGBT) and other circuit components. Consequently, a fundamental principle of power inductor design is to ensure the core operates well below the knee of its B-H curve under all conditions, typically with a significant safety margin.",

Applying this condition:\n$$ E_y(0,t) = -2\\pi f \\hat{B} \\cos(2\\pi f t) \\cdot 0 + C(t) = 0 \\implies C(t) = 0 $$\nTherefore, the electric field within the slab is:\n$$ \\mathbf{E}(x,t) = -2\\pi f \\hat{B} x \\cos(2\\pi f t)\\,\\mathbf{\\hat{y}} $$\nNext, we find the eddy current density $\\mathbf{J}$ using Ohm's law, $\\mathbf{J} = \\sigma \\mathbf{E} = \\frac{1}{\\rho}\\mathbf{E}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{J}(x,t) = -\\frac{2\\pi f \\hat{B} x}{\\rho} \\cos(2\\pi f t)\\,\\mathbf{\\hat{y}} $$\nThe instantaneous power loss density due to Joule heating is $p = \\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\mathbf{E}$.\n$$ p(x,t) = \\left( -\\frac{2\\pi f \\hat{B} x}{\\rho} \\cos(2\\pi f t)\\,\\mathbf{\\hat{y}} \\right) \\cdot \\left( -2\\pi f \\hat{B} x \\cos(2\\pi f t)\\,\\mathbf{\\hat{y}} \\right) = \\frac{(2\\pi f \\hat{B} x)^2}{\\rho} \\cos^2(2\\pi f t) $$\nTo find the power loss per unit volume, we first average $p(x,t)$ over the thickness $d$ of the slab:\n$$ \\langle p(t) \\rangle_{vol} = \\frac{1}{d} \\int_{-d/2}^{d/2} p(x,t) \\,dx = \\frac{1}{d} \\int_{-d/2}^{d/2} \\frac{(2\\pi f \\hat{B})^2}{\\rho} x^2 \\cos^2(2\\pi f t) \\,dx $$\n$$ \\langle p(t) \\rangle_{vol} = \\frac{(2\\pi f \\hat{B})^2}{\\rho d} \\cos^2(2\\pi f t) \\int_{-d/2}^{d/2} x^2 \\,dx $$\nThe integral of $x^2$ is $\\int_{-d/2}^{d/2} x^2 \\,dx = \\left[\\frac{x^3}{3}\\right]_{-d/2}^{d/2} = \\frac{(d/2)^3}{3} - \\frac{(-d/2)^3}{3} = \\frac{d^3}{24} + \\frac{d^3}{24} = \\frac{d^3}{12}$.\nSubstituting this back:\n$$ \\langle p(t) \\rangle_{vol} = \\frac{(2\\pi f \\hat{B})^2}{\\rho d} \\cos^2(2\\pi f t) \\left( \\frac{d^3}{12} \\right) = \\frac{(2\\pi f \\hat{B} d)^2}{12\\rho} \\cos^2(2\\pi f t) $$\nFinally, we compute the time-average value, $\\overline{p}_{e}(d)$, by averaging over one period $T=1/f$. The time average of $\\cos^2(2\\pi f t)$ over one period is $1/2$.\n$$ \\overline{p}_{e}(d) = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^T \\langle p(t) \\rangle_{vol} \\,dt = \\frac{(2\\pi f \\hat{B} d)^2}{12\\rho} \\left( \\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^T \\cos^2(2\\pi f t) \\,dt \\right) = \\frac{(2\\pi f \\hat{B} d)^2}{12\\rho} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} $$\n$$ \\overline{p}_{e}(d) = \\frac{4\\pi^2 f^2 \\hat{B}^2 d^2}{24\\rho} = \\frac{\\pi^2 f^2 \\hat{B}^2 d^2}{6\\rho} $$\nThis expression for $\\overline{p}_{e}(d)$ verifies the classical thin-plate eddy-current loss dependence: the loss per unit volume is proportional to the square of the thickness ($d^2$), the square of the frequency ($f^2$), the square of the peak magnetic flux density ($\\hat{B}^2$), and inversely proportional to the electrical resistivity ($\\rho$).\n\nNow, we apply this formula to the two cores specified in the problem.\n- Core A is a solid slab with thickness $D$. Its average loss per unit volume is $\\overline{p}_{e}(D)$.\n- Core B is a laminated stack of sheets, each of thickness $t$. The eddy currents are confined to each individual sheet. Therefore, the average loss per unit volume for the laminated core is the same as that for a single sheet of thickness $t$, which is $\\overline{p}_{e}(t)$.\n\nThe material properties ($\\rho$), peak flux density ($\\hat{B}$), and frequency ($f$) are the same for both cores.\n$$ \\overline{p}_{e}(D) = \\frac{\\pi^2 f^2 \\hat{B}^2 D^2}{6\\rho} $$\n$$ \\overline{p}_{e}(t) = \\frac{\\pi^2 f^2 \\hat{B}^2 t^2}{6\\rho} $$\nThe reduction factor $R$ is defined as the ratio of these two quantities:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\overline{p}_{e}(t)}{\\overline{p}_{e}(D)} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi^2 f^2 \\hat{B}^2 t^2}{6\\rho}}{\\frac{\\pi^2 f^2 \\hat{B}^2 D^2}{6\\rho}} $$\nAll common terms cancel out, leaving:\n$$ R = \\frac{t^2}{D^2} = \\left(\\frac{t}{D}\\right)^2 $$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the reduction factor in terms of $t$ and $D$.",
