            "problem": "A single-phase high-frequency transformer used in an isolated power converter has a high-voltage winding with $N_{\\mathrm{HV}}$ turns and a low-voltage winding with $N_{\\mathrm{LV}}$ turns, such that the ideal turns ratio is $n = N_{\\mathrm{HV}}/N_{\\mathrm{LV}} = 10$. The device operates at an angular frequency $\\omega = 2\\pi f$ with $f = 50\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$. The magnetizing branch of the transformer equivalent circuit (referred to the high-voltage side) consists of a parallel combination of a magnetizing inductance $L_m$ and a core-loss resistance $R_c$, both defined at the operating frequency. To characterize these parameters without loading the transformer, an open-circuit test is performed on the low-voltage side at the operating frequency, using a sinusoidal excitation. \n\nDescribe, in scientifically precise terms grounded in fundamental laws and definitions (no shortcuts), how to conduct the open-circuit test to isolate and measure the magnetizing branch at the operating frequency. Your description must articulate the measurement of root-mean-square (RMS) voltage, RMS current, and real input power, and why these are sufficient to determine $L_m$ and $R_c$ at the test frequency. Then, starting from Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction and the definitions of RMS and average power for sinusoidal steady-state, derive expressions that enable computing $L_m$ and $R_c$ from the measured RMS voltage, RMS current, and real power on the low-voltage side.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of electromagnetic induction and alternating current (AC) circuit theory, well-posed with sufficient information to determine a unique solution, and objective in its formulation. The assumptions provided, such as neglecting leakage impedance, are standard for the open-circuit test and simplify the model to isolate the magnetizing branch, which is the goal of the test. All provided numerical values are physically realistic for a high-frequency power converter. Therefore, a reasoned solution can be constructed.\n\nThe open-circuit test is a standard procedure to determine the parameters of the magnetizing branch of a transformer, which consists of the parallel combination of a core-loss resistance $R_c$ and a magnetizing inductance $L_m$. The procedure and its underlying principles are as follows:\n\n1.  **Test Procedure:** One winding of the transformer is energized by a sinusoidal voltage source at the desired frequency, while the other winding is left open-circuited. In this problem, the low-voltage (LV) winding is energized at the operating frequency $f = 50\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$, and the high-voltage (HV) winding is left open. Three instruments are used to measure the input quantities at the LV terminals: a voltmeter measures the RMS voltage $V_{\\mathrm{LV}}$, an ammeter measures the RMS current $I_{\\mathrm{oc,LV}}$, and a wattmeter measures the real (average) input power $P_{\\mathrm{oc,LV}}$.\n\n2.  **Sufficiency of Measurements:** With the secondary winding open, no load current can flow. The current $I_{\\mathrm{oc,LV}}$ drawn by the primary (LV) winding is solely the excitation current needed to establish the magnetic flux in the core and to supply the core losses (hysteresis and eddy current losses). In the equivalent circuit, this current flows entirely through the parallel magnetizing branch. The winding resistance's voltage drop is typically negligible compared to the applied voltage due to the small magnitude of the excitation current, so the applied voltage is considered to be directly across the magnetizing branch. The three measurements ($V_{\\mathrm{LV}}$, $I_{\\mathrm{oc,LV}}$, $P_{\\mathrm{oc,LV}}$) are sufficient because they completely characterize the apparent power triangle of the magnetizing branch. The real power $P_{\\mathrm{oc,LV}}$ is exclusively dissipated in the resistive component $R_c$. The apparent power $S_{\\mathrm{oc,LV}} = V_{\\mathrm{LV}} I_{\\mathrm{oc,LV}}$ is the vector sum of the real power and the reactive power $Q_{\\mathrm{oc,LV}}$. The reactive power is associated with the energy stored in the magnetizing inductance $L_m$. By resolving the apparent power into its real and reactive components, one can uniquely determine the values of the resistance and reactance, and thus $R_c$ and $L_m$.\n\n3.  **Derivation from Fundamental Principles:**\nLet the applied sinusoidal voltage on the low-voltage side be represented in the time domain as $v_{\\mathrm{LV}}(t) = V_{\\mathrm{peak}} \\sin(\\omega t)$, where $V_{\\mathrm{peak}} = \\sqrt{2} V_{\\mathrm{LV}}$ and $\\omega = 2\\pi f$. In phasor representation, this is $\\mathbf{V}_{\\mathrm{LV}} = V_{\\mathrm{LV}} \\angle 0^\\circ$.\n\nThe total excitation current drawn, $\\mathbf{I}_{\\mathrm{oc,LV}}$, is the phasor sum of the current through the core-loss resistance, $\\mathbf{I}_{c,\\mathrm{LV}}$, and the current through the magnetizing inductance, $\\mathbf{I}_{m,\\mathrm{LV}}$. The components are in parallel, so they share the same voltage $\\mathbf{V}_{\\mathrm{LV}}$.\n$$ \\mathbf{I}_{\\mathrm{oc,LV}} = \\mathbf{I}_{c,\\mathrm{LV}} + \\mathbf{I}_{m,\\mathrm{LV}} $$\nThe core-loss resistance $R_{c,\\mathrm{LV}}$ is a purely resistive element. The current through it is in phase with the voltage:\n$$ \\mathbf{I}_{c,\\mathrm{LV}} = \\frac{\\mathbf{V}_{\\mathrm{LV}}}{R_{c,\\mathrm{LV}}} $$\nThe average power, $P$, for a sinusoidal voltage and current is defined as $P = V_{\\mathrm{RMS}} I_{\\mathrm{RMS}} \\cos(\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the phase angle between them. For the resistor $R_{c,\\mathrm{LV}}$, $\\theta = 0$, so the power dissipated is $P_{c,\\mathrm{LV}} = V_{\\mathrm{LV}} I_{c,\\mathrm{LV}}$. An ideal inductor stores and returns energy but dissipates no average power. Therefore, all measured real power $P_{\\mathrm{oc,LV}}$ must be dissipated in $R_{c,\\mathrm{LV}}$.\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{oc,LV}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{LV}}^2}{R_{c,\\mathrm{LV}}} $$\nFrom this, we can express the core-loss resistance on the LV side:\n$$ R_{c,\\mathrm{LV}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{LV}}^2}{P_{\\mathrm{oc,LV}}} $$\nThe magnetizing inductance $L_{m,\\mathrm{LV}}$ relates voltage and current according to Faraday's law of induction, $v(t) = L \\frac{di(t)}{dt}$. For a sinusoidal steady state, this relationship in the phasor domain is $\\mathbf{V} = j\\omega L \\mathbf{I}$. Thus, the current through the inductor lags the voltage by $90^\\circ$:\n$$ \\mathbf{I}_{m,\\mathrm{LV}} = \\frac{\\mathbf{V}_{\\mathrm{LV}}}{j\\omega L_{m,\\mathrm{LV}}} = -j \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{LV}}}{\\omega L_{m,\\mathrm{LV}}} $$\nSince $\\mathbf{I}_{c,\\mathrm{LV}}$ is real (in phase with $\\mathbf{V}_{\\mathrm{LV}}$) and $\\mathbf{I}_{m,\\mathrm{LV}}$ is purely imaginary and negative (lagging by $90^\\circ$), the two current components are orthogonal. The magnitude of the total current can be found using the Pythagorean theorem on the RMS magnitudes:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{oc,LV}}^2 = I_{c,\\mathrm{LV}}^2 + I_{m,\\mathrm{LV}}^2 $$\nWe can find the magnitude of the core-loss current $I_{c,\\mathrm{LV}}$ from the power measurement: $I_{c,\\mathrm{LV}} = P_{\\mathrm{oc,LV}} / V_{\\mathrm{LV}}$. Substituting this into the previous equation allows us to solve for the magnitude of the magnetizing current, $I_{m,\\mathrm{LV}}$:\n$$ I_{m,\\mathrm{LV}} = \\sqrt{I_{\\mathrm{oc,LV}}^2 - I_{c,\\mathrm{LV}}^2} = \\sqrt{I_{\\mathrm{oc,LV}}^2 - \\left(\\frac{P_{\\mathrm{oc,LV}}}{V_{\\mathrm{LV}}}\\right)^2} $$\nFrom the phasor relationship for the inductor, the magnitude of the magnetizing current is also $I_{m,\\mathrm{LV}} = V_{\\mathrm{LV}} / (\\omega L_{m,\\mathrm{LV}})$. This allows us to solve for $L_{m,\\mathrm{LV}}$:\n$$ L_{m,\\mathrm{LV}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{LV}}}{\\omega I_{m,\\mathrm{LV}}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{LV}}}{\\omega \\sqrt{I_{\\mathrm{oc,LV}}^2 - \\left(\\frac{P_{\\mathrm{oc,LV}}}{V_{\\mathrm{LV}}}\\right)^2}} $$\nThe problem requires the parameters $R_c$ and $L_m$ referred to the high-voltage side. Impedances are referred across an ideal transformer by the square of the turns ratio $n = N_{\\mathrm{HV}}/N_{\\mathrm{LV}}$. If $Z_{\\mathrm{LV}}$ is an impedance on the LV side, its referred value on the HV side is $Z_{\\mathrm{HV}} = n^2 Z_{\\mathrm{LV}}$.\nFor the resistive component: $R_c = n^2 R_{c,\\mathrm{LV}}$.\nFor the inductive component: The impedance is $Z_{L, \\mathrm{HV}} = j\\omega L_m$. We also have $Z_{L, \\mathrm{HV}} = n^2 Z_{L, \\mathrm{LV}} = n^2 (j\\omega L_{m,\\mathrm{LV}})$. Equating these gives $j\\omega L_m = n^2 j\\omega L_{m,\\mathrm{LV}}$, which simplifies to $L_m = n^2 L_{m,\\mathrm{LV}}$.\n\nTherefore, the final expressions for the parameters referred to the HV side are:\n$$ R_c = n^2 \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{LV}}^2}{P_{\\mathrm{oc,LV}}} $$\n$$ L_m = n^2 \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{LV}}}{\\omega \\sqrt{I_{\\mathrm{oc,LV}}^2 - \\left(\\frac{P_{\\mathrm{oc,LV}}}{V_{\\mathrm{LV}}}\\right)^2}} $$\n\n4.  **Numerical Calculation:**\nThe given values are:\n$n = 10$\n$f = 50\\,\\mathrm{kHz} = 5 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$\n$\\omega = 2\\pi f = 2\\pi(5 \\times 10^4) = 10^5 \\pi \\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$\n$V_{\\mathrm{LV}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n$I_{\\mathrm{oc,LV}} = 0.55\\,\\mathrm{A}$\n$P_{\\mathrm{oc,LV}} = 4.8\\,\\mathrm{W}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the core-loss resistance $R_c$ referred to the HV side:\n$$ R_c = (10)^2 \\times \\frac{(20\\,\\mathrm{V})^2}{4.8\\,\\mathrm{W}} = 100 \\times \\frac{400}{4.8}\\,\\Omega = 100 \\times 83.333... \\,\\Omega = 8333.333... \\,\\Omega $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $R_c = 8333\\,\\Omega$.\n\nNext, we calculate the magnetizing inductance $L_m$ referred to the HV side. First, we find the magnitude of the magnetizing current on the LV side, $I_{m,\\mathrm{LV}}$:\n$$ I_{m,\\mathrm{LV}} = \\sqrt{(0.55\\,\\mathrm{A})^2 - \\left(\\frac{4.8\\,\\mathrm{W}}{20\\,\\mathrm{V}}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{0.3025 - (0.24)^2}\\,\\mathrm{A} = \\sqrt{0.3025 - 0.0576}\\,\\mathrm{A} = \\sqrt{0.2449}\\,\\mathrm{A} \\approx 0.4948737\\,\\mathrm{A} $$\nNow we calculate $L_{m,\\mathrm{LV}}$:\n$$ L_{m,\\mathrm{LV}} = \\frac{20\\,\\mathrm{V}}{(10^5 \\pi \\,\\mathrm{rad/s}) \\times (\\sqrt{0.2449}\\,\\mathrm{A})} \\approx \\frac{20}{155469.5}\\,\\mathrm{H} \\approx 1.28642 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{H} $$\nFinally, we refer this inductance to the HV side:\n$$ L_m = n^2 L_{m,\\mathrm{LV}} = (10)^2 \\times (1.28642 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{H}) = 100 \\times 1.28642 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{H} \\approx 0.0128642\\,\\mathrm{H} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $L_m = 0.01286\\,\\mathrm{H}$.\n\nThe final computed values are $L_m = 0.01286\\,\\mathrm{H}$ and $R_c = 8333\\,\\Omega$.",

The provided data are physically plausible and consistent with the theoretical model of a transformer under a short-circuit test.

For analysis, it is conventional to refer all secondary-side quantities to the primary side using the square of the turns ratio $a = N_p / N_s$.\n\nIn a short-circuit test, the secondary terminals are connected by a very low impedance path, effectively forcing the secondary voltage $V_s$ to approximately zero. According to Faraday's law of induction, the voltage induced in a winding is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux linking it. Since the secondary voltage is near zero, the net magnetic flux in the core must be very small. Consequently, the magnetizing current required to establish this flux is negligible compared to the full load current. The current in the magnetizing branch can be ignored, which simplifies the equivalent circuit.\n\nUnder this assumption, the input impedance $Z_{\\text{in}}(j\\omega)$ measured at the primary terminals is determined solely by the series combination of the primary winding impedance and the reflected secondary winding impedance.

The square of the primary RMS current is:\n$$I_{p,\\text{rms}}^{2} = \\left(\\frac{I_{o}}{n}\\right)^{2} D = \\frac{I_{o}^{2} D}{n^{2}}$$\n\nThe total average conduction loss, $P_{\\text{loss}}$, is the sum of the Joule heating losses in the primary and secondary paths. This is given by $P = I_{\\text{rms}}^{2} R$.\n$$P_{\\text{loss}} = P_{\\text{loss},p} + P_{\\text{loss},s} = I_{p,\\text{rms}}^{2} R_{p} + I_{s,\\text{rms}}^{2} R_{s}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the RMS currents:\n$$P_{\\text{loss}} = \\left(\\frac{I_{o}^{2} D}{n^{2}}\\right) R_{p} + \\left(I_{o}^{2} D\\right) R_{s}$$\n\nThis expression for loss depends on two variables, $n$ and $D$. To perform the optimization with respect to $n$, we must express $D$ as a function of $n$. The problem provides the ideal forward converter voltage relationship, which links the duty cycle $D$ to the turns ratio $n$ for a regulated output voltage $V_{o}$ from an input voltage $V_{\\text{in}}$:\n$$V_{o} = D \\frac{V_{\\text{in}}}{n}$$\nSolving for $D$, we get:\n$$D = \\frac{n V_{o}}{V_{\\text{in}}}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $D$ into the equation for $P_{\\text{loss}}$ to obtain the loss as a function of $n$ only:\n$$P_{\\text{loss}}(n) = \\left(\\frac{I_{o}^{2}}{n^{2}} \\left(\\frac{n V_{o}}{V_{\\text{in}}}\\right)\\right) R_{p} + \\left(I_{o}^{2} \\left(\\frac{n V_{o}}{V_{\\text{in}}}\\right)\\right) R_{s}$$\nSimplifying this expression:\n$$P_{\\text{loss}}(n) = \\frac{I_{o}^{2} V_{o}}{V_{\\text{in}}} \\frac{R_{p}}{n} + \\frac{I_{o}^{2} V_{o}}{V_{\\text{in}}} n R_{s}$$\nWe can factor out the constant terms:\n$$P_{\\text{loss}}(n) = \\frac{I_{o}^{2} V_{o}}{V_{\\text{in}}} \\left(\\frac{R_{p}}{n} + n R_{s}\\right)$$\n\nTo find the turns ratio $n$ that minimizes this loss function, we compute the derivative of $P_{\\text{loss}}(n)$ with respect to $n$ and set it to zero.\n$$\\frac{d P_{\\text{loss}}}{dn} = \\frac{d}{dn} \\left[ \\frac{I_{o}^{2} V_{o}}{V_{\\text{in}}} \\left(\\frac{R_{p}}{n} + n R_{s}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{I_{o}^{2} V_{o}}{V_{\\text{in}}} \\left(-\\frac{R_{p}}{n^{2}} + R_{s}\\right)$$\nSetting the derivative to zero to find the extremum:\n$$\\frac{I_{o}^{2} V_{o}}{V_{\\text{in}}} \\left(-\\frac{R_{p}}{n^{2}} + R_{s}\\right) = 0$$\nSince the constant factor is non-zero, we must have:\n$$-\\frac{R_{p}}{n^{2}} + R_{s} = 0 \\implies R_{s} = \\frac{R_{p}}{n^{2}}$$\nSolving for $n$, we find the unconstrained optimal turns ratio, which we denote as $n_{\\text{opt}}$:\n$$n_{\\text{opt}}^{2} = \\frac{R_{p}}{R_{s}} \\implies n_{\\text{opt}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{p}}{R_{s}}}$$\nTo confirm this is a minimum, we check the second derivative:\n$$\\frac{d^{2} P_{\\text{loss}}}{dn^{2}} = \\frac{I_{o}^{2} V_{o}}{V_{\\text{in}}} \\left(\\frac{2R_{p}}{n^{3}}\\right)$$\nSince all quantities ($I_{o}$, $V_{o}$, $V_{\\text{in}}$, $R_{p}$, $n$) are positive, the second derivative is positive, confirming that $n_{\\text{opt}}$ corresponds to a local minimum.\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values for the resistances:\n$$n_{\\text{opt}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{50 \\times 10^{-3}}{7 \\times 10^{-3}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{50}{7}}$$\n$$n_{\\text{opt}} \\approx 2.67261$$\n\nBefore finalizing this value, we must verify that it respects the maximum duty cycle constraint, $D \\leq D_{\\max}$. The duty cycle corresponding to $n_{\\text{opt}}$ is:\n$$D_{\\text{opt}} = \\frac{n_{\\text{opt}} V_{o}}{V_{\\text{in}}}$$\nUsing the given numerical data: $V_{\\text{in}} = 400\\ \\text{V}$, $V_{o} = 48\\ \\text{V}$, and $D_{\\max} = 0.50$.\n$$D_{\\text{opt}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{50}{7}} \\times \\frac{48}{400} = \\sqrt{\\frac{50}{7}} \\times 0.12$$\n$$D_{\\text{opt}} \\approx 2.67261 \\times 0.12 \\approx 0.32071$$\nWe compare this to the maximum allowed duty cycle:\n$$0.32071 \\leq 0.50$$\nThe condition is satisfied. The unconstrained minimum for the loss function lies within the allowed operating region for the duty cycle. Therefore, the optimal turns ratio is indeed $n_{\\text{opt}}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the final answer rounded to four significant figures.\n$$n = 2.67261... \\approx 2.673$$\nIf the calculated $D_{\\text{opt}}$ had been greater than $D_{\\max}$, the optimal choice for $n$ under the constraint would be the maximum allowed value, $n_{\\max} = D_{\\max}V_{\\text{in}}/V_{o}$, because the loss function is convex and its minimum would lie outside the feasible region, making the boundary point the optimum. However, this is not the case here.",
