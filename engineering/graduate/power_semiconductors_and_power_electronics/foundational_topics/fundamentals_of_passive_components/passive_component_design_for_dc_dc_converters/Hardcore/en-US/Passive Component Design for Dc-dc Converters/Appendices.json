            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the minimum inductance $L_{\\min}$ and the corresponding peak inductor current for an ideal buck converter. We begin from fundamental principles as specified.\n\nAn ideal buck converter operates by modulating a switch (typically a MOSFET) with a certain duty cycle $D$. The converter is operating in steady-state continuous conduction mode (CCM), which means the inductor current $i_L(t)$ never drops to zero.\n\nFirst, we determine the duty cycle $D$. For an ideal buck converter, the output voltage $V_{out}$ is related to the input voltage $V_{in}$ by the duty cycle $D$:\n$$V_{out} = D \\cdot V_{in}$$\nGiven $V_{in} = 24\\ \\mathrm{V}$ and $V_{out} = 12\\ \\mathrm{V}$, we can solve for $D$:\n$$D = \\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} = \\frac{12\\ \\mathrm{V}}{24\\ \\mathrm{V}} = 0.5$$\n\nThe analysis proceeds by applying the principle of volt-second balance on the inductor, which states that over one complete switching period $T_s$, the net change in inductor flux (and thus the time integral of inductor voltage) must be zero for steady-state operation. The switching period is the reciprocal of the switching frequency $f_s$: $T_s = 1/f_s$.\n\nThe inductor current ripple, $\\Delta i_L$, is the change in inductor current during either the switch-on or switch-off interval. We will analyze the switch-on interval, which has a duration of $DT_s$. During this time, the switch is closed, and the voltage across the inductor $v_L(t)$ is constant and equal to:\n$$v_L = V_{in} - V_{out}$$\nWe start with the inductor's constitutive relation:\n$$v_L(t) = L \\frac{di_L(t)}{dt}$$\nAssuming $L$ is constant, we can separate variables and integrate over the switch-on interval ($0 \\le t \\le DT_s$) to find the change in current. Since the voltage $v_L$ is constant during this interval, the rate of change of current is also constant, meaning the current increases linearly.\n$$\\Delta i_L = \\int_{0}^{DT_s} \\frac{v_L}{L} dt = \\frac{V_{in} - V_{out}}{L} \\int_{0}^{DT_s} dt$$\n$$\\Delta i_L = \\frac{V_{in} - V_{out}}{L} (DT_s)$$\nSubstituting $T_s = 1/f_s$:\n$$\\Delta i_L = \\frac{(V_{in} - V_{out})D}{L f_s}$$\nThe problem states that the peak-to-peak inductor current ripple $\\Delta i_L$ must not exceed $2\\ \\mathrm{A}$.

In steady-state CCM, the average inductor current, $I_L$, is equal to the DC output current, $I_{out}$.\n$$I_L = I_{out} = 10\\ \\mathrm{A}$$\nThe inductor current waveform is triangular, varying between a minimum value $i_{L, \\text{min}}$ and a peak value $i_{L, \\text{peak}}$. The average current is the midpoint of this variation. The peak-to-peak ripple is $\\Delta i_L = i_{L, \\text{peak}} - i_{L, \\text{min}}$. The peak current is the average current plus half of the peak-to-peak ripple.\n$$i_{L, \\text{peak}} = I_L + \\frac{\\Delta i_L}{2}$$\nThe calculation is performed for the case where the inductance is $L_{\\min}$, which corresponds to the maximum allowed ripple $\\Delta i_L = 2\\ \\mathrm{A}$.\n$$i_{L, \\text{peak}} = 10\\ \\mathrm{A} + \\frac{2\\ \\mathrm{A}}{2} = 10\\ \\mathrm{A} + 1\\ \\mathrm{A} = 11\\ \\mathrm{A}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $i_{L, \\text{peak}} = 11.0\\ \\mathrm{A}$.\n\nThe minimum inductance required is $15.0\\ \\mu\\mathrm{H}$, and the corresponding peak inductor current is $11.0\\ \\mathrm{A}$.",

The output inductor and capacitor form a second-order resonant system, and without sufficient damping, this filter can exhibit undesirable ringing and voltage overshoot.

The output filter consists of an inductor and a capacitor; the capacitor has a finite Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR). Neglect parasitic resistance of the inductor and any active control action. The passive network topology is thus an inductor of inductance $L$ feeding a shunt branch composed of a series combination of ESR $R_{ESR}$ and ideal capacitor $C$ to ground.

The conclusion about sufficiency does not need to be reported in the final numerical answer; only the rounded $Q$ must be provided as your final answer.",
            "solution": "We begin by modeling the small-signal behavior of the output filter for the homogeneous response. The input voltage source to the filter is suppressed, meaning it is set to $0\\,\\text{V}$ (ground). The load is a constant-current source, which has an infinite incremental resistance, so it is modeled as an open circuit for small-signal analysis. The resulting circuit consists of the inductor $L$, the capacitor $C$, and the resistor $R_{ESR}$ forming a closed loop.\n\nLet $i_L(t)$ be the small-signal current flowing through the inductor $L$. Applying Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at the node connecting $L$, $C$, and the load, we see that the inductor current must flow entirely into the series branch of the capacitor and its ESR, as the load draws no small-signal current. Thus, the current through the capacitor, $i_C(t)$, is equal to the inductor current:\n$$i_C(t) = i_L(t)$$\n\nNow, we apply Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) to the single loop formed by the components. The sum of voltage drops across the inductor ($v_L$), the ESR ($v_{ESR}$), and the capacitor ($v_C$) must be zero:\n$$v_L(t) + v_{ESR}(t) + v_C(t) = 0$$\n\nWe substitute the constitutive relations for each component:\n- The voltage across the inductor is $v_L(t) = L \\frac{d i_L(t)}{d t}$.\n- The voltage across the ESR is $v_{ESR}(t) = i_C(t) R_{ESR}$. Since $i_C(t) = i_L(t)$, this becomes $v_{ESR}(t) = i_L(t) R_{ESR}$.\n- The relationship between capacitor current and voltage is $i_C(t) = C \\frac{d v_C(t)}{d t}$. Substituting $i_L(t)$ for $i_C(t)$ gives $i_L(t) = C \\frac{d v_C(t)}{d t}$. To express $v_C(t)$ in terms of $i_L(t)$, we integrate this relation: $v_C(t) = \\frac{1}{C} \\int i_L(t) \\, dt$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the KVL equation yields an integro-differential equation for $i_L(t)$:\n$$L \\frac{d i_L(t)}{d t} + R_{ESR} i_L(t) + \\frac{1}{C} \\int i_L(t) \\, dt = 0$$\n\nTo obtain the desired second-order ordinary differential equation, we differentiate the entire equation with respect to time $t$:\n$$\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( L \\frac{d i_L(t)}{d t} + R_{ESR} i_L(t) + \\frac{1}{C} \\int i_L(t) \\, dt \\right) = 0$$\n$$L \\frac{d^2 i_L(t)}{d t^2} + R_{ESR} \\frac{d i_L(t)}{d t} + \\frac{1}{C} i_L(t) = 0$$\n\nThis is the homogeneous second-order differential equation governing $i_L(t)$. To identify the natural frequency and damping ratio, we normalize the equation by dividing by $L$:\n$$\\frac{d^2 i_L(t)}{d t^2} + \\frac{R_{ESR}}{L} \\frac{d i_L(t)}{d t} + \\frac{1}{LC} i_L(t) = 0$$\n\nWe compare this to the canonical form of a second-order system:\n$$\\frac{d^2 x(t)}{d t^2} + 2\\zeta\\omega_o \\frac{d x(t)}{d t} + \\omega_o^2 x(t) = 0$$\n\nBy comparing coefficients, we identify the undamped natural frequency $\\omega_o$ and the damping ratio $\\zeta$:\n- From the coefficient of the $i_L(t)$ term:\n$$\\omega_o^2 = \\frac{1}{LC} \\implies \\omega_o = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{LC}}$$\n- From the coefficient of the $\\frac{d i_L(t)}{d t}$ term:\n$$2\\zeta\\omega_o = \\frac{R_{ESR}}{L} \\implies \\zeta = \\frac{R_{ESR}}{2L\\omega_o}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\omega_o$:\n$$\\zeta = \\frac{R_{ESR}}{2L} \\left( \\sqrt{LC} \\right) = \\frac{R_{ESR}}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{C}{L}}$$\n\nThe quality factor $Q$ is defined as $Q = \\frac{1}{2\\zeta}$.

From Faraday's law of induction for an inductor, $v_{L} = L \\frac{di_{L}}{dt}$. Assuming a constant voltage across the inductor during the ON-time, the change in inductor current, which is the peak-to-peak ripple $\\Delta I_{\\mathrm{pp}}$, is given by:\n$$ \\Delta I_{\\mathrm{pp}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{in}} - V_{\\mathrm{out}}}{L} t_{\\mathrm{on}} $$\nThe ON-time $t_{\\mathrm{on}}$ is the product of the duty cycle $D$ and the switching period $T_{s} = 1/f_{s}$.
