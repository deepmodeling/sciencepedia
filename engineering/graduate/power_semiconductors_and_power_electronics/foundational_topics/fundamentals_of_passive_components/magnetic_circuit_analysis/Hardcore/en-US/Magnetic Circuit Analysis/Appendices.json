            "problem": "An inductive component for a switching converter in power electronics uses a laminated E-core of uniform, linear, isotropic magnetic material with relative permeability $\\mu_{r}$ and vacuum permeability $\\mu_{0}$. A coil of $N$ turns is wound on the center limb. The core is symmetric: the center limb has average magnetic path length $l_{c}$ and constant cross-sectional area $A_{c}$, and each of the two identical outer limbs has average magnetic path length $l_{o}$ and constant cross-sectional area $A_{o}$. The back yoke and top yoke are sufficiently wide that their reluctances may be neglected compared to those of the limbs. Ignore leakage and fringing, and assume that the magnetization curve is linear over the operating range.\n\nStarting from magnetostatics fundamentals—Ampère’s law in integral form $\\oint \\mathbf{H} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = N i$, the constitutive relation $\\mathbf{B} = \\mu \\mathbf{H}$, and flux continuity $\\Phi = \\int \\mathbf{B} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A}$—establish the series-parallel magnetic reluctance network that captures the flux return from the center limb through the two outer limbs.

No rounding is required; provide the exact symbolic expression.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is found to be valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a complete and consistent set of parameters to define a standard magnetic circuit problem based on fundamental principles of magnetostatics.\n\nThe analysis begins from the fundamental laws of magnetostatics to establish a magnetic circuit model for the E-core.\n\n1.  **Magnetomotive Force (MMF) and Ampère's Law:**\n    Ampère's law in integral form is given as $\\oint \\mathbf{H} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = I_{\\mathrm{encl}}$. For a coil of $N$ turns carrying a current $i$, the total enclosed current is $N i$. This quantity is defined as the magnetomotive force (MMF), denoted by $\\mathcal{F}$.\n    $$ \\mathcal{F} = N i = \\oint \\mathbf{H} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} $$\n    Here, $\\mathbf{H}$ is the magnetic field intensity. The MMF is the driving potential in a magnetic circuit, analogous to electromotive force (voltage) in an electrical circuit.\n\n2.  **Magnetic Flux and Constitutive Relation:**\n    The magnetic flux, $\\Phi$, through a surface is the integral of the magnetic flux density, $\\mathbf{B}$, over that surface:\n    $$ \\Phi = \\int \\mathbf{B} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A} $$\n    For a linear, isotropic magnetic material, the constitutive relation connects $\\mathbf{B}$ and $\\mathbf{H}$:\n    $$ \\mathbf{B} = \\mu \\mathbf{H} $$\n    The permeability of the material is $\\mu = \\mu_r \\mu_0$, where $\\mu_r$ is the relative permeability and $\\mu_0$ is the permeability of vacuum.\n\n3.  **Definition of Magnetic Reluctance:**\n    Magnetic reluctance, $\\mathcal{R}$, is defined as the ratio of MMF to the magnetic flux it produces, analogous to Ohm's law ($V=IR$):\n    $$ \\mathcal{F} = \\mathcal{R} \\Phi $$\n    To derive an expression for the reluctance of a segment of the core, we make standard simplifying assumptions: the magnetic field is uniform across the cross-sectional area $A$ and is directed along the mean magnetic path length $l$. Under these assumptions, the integrals simplify:\n    - $\\mathcal{F} = \\oint \\mathbf{H} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} \\approx H l$\n    - $\\Phi = \\int \\mathbf{B} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A} \\approx B A$\n    Substituting these into the reluctance definition, along with the constitutive relation $B = \\mu H$:\n    $$ \\mathcal{R} = \\frac{\\mathcal{F}}{\\Phi} \\approx \\frac{H l}{B A} = \\frac{H l}{(\\mu H) A} = \\frac{l}{\\mu A} $$\n    This formula will be used to calculate the reluctance of each limb of the core.\n\n4.  **Magnetic Circuit Model of the E-Core:**\n    The problem describes a symmetric E-core with a coil on the center limb. The MMF source, $\\mathcal{F} = N i$, is located in the center limb. The flux $\\Phi_c$ produced by this MMF first traverses the center limb. The reluctance of the center limb, denoted $\\mathcal{R}_c$, is given by:\n    $$ \\mathcal{R}_c = \\frac{l_c}{\\mu A_c} = \\frac{l_c}{\\mu_r \\mu_0 A_c} $$\n    The problem states that the yokes have negligible reluctance. Thus, after passing through the center limb, the flux $\\Phi_c$ reaches a junction where it splits to return through the two outer limbs. Due to the symmetry of the core, the flux divides equally between the two identical outer paths. Each outer limb carries a flux of $\\Phi_c / 2$.\n    The reluctance of each outer limb, denoted $\\mathcal{R}_o$, is:\n    $$ \\mathcal{R}_o = \\frac{l_o}{\\mu A_o} = \\frac{l_o}{\\mu_r \\mu_0 A_o} $$\n    The two outer limbs represent parallel paths for the return flux. The magnetic circuit can therefore be modeled as the reluctance of the center limb, $\\mathcal{R}_c$, in series with the parallel combination of the two outer limb reluctances, $\\mathcal{R}_o$.\n\n5.  **Calculation of Equivalent Reluctance ($\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{eq}}$):**\n    First, we find the equivalent reluctance of the two parallel outer limbs, $\\mathcal{R}_{o,p}$:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{\\mathcal{R}_{o,p}} = \\frac{1}{\\mathcal{R}_o} + \\frac{1}{\\mathcal{R}_o} = \\frac{2}{\\mathcal{R}_o} $$\n    $$ \\mathcal{R}_{o,p} = \\frac{\\mathcal{R}_o}{2} $$\n    The total equivalent reluctance, $\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{eq}}$, seen by the MMF source is the series sum of $\\mathcal{R}_c$ and $\\mathcal{R}_{o,p}$:\n    $$ \\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\mathcal{R}_c + \\mathcal{R}_{o,p} = \\mathcal{R}_c + \\frac{\\mathcal{R}_o}{2} $$\n    Now, we substitute the expressions for $\\mathcal{R}_c$ and $\\mathcal{R}_o$ in terms of the given physical parameters:\n    $$ \\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{l_c}{\\mu_r \\mu_0 A_c} + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{l_o}{\\mu_r \\mu_0 A_o} \\right) $$\n    Factoring out the common term $\\frac{1}{\\mu_r \\mu_0}$ yields the final closed-form analytic expression for the equivalent reluctance:\n    $$ \\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_r \\mu_0} \\left( \\frac{l_c}{A_c} + \\frac{l_o}{2 A_o} \\right) $$\nThis expression represents the total opposition to the establishment of magnetic flux in the E-core, as seen by the coil on the center limb.",
