A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of Forward Current Density ($J$)**\n\nThe current transport in a Schottky diode, under the assumption of thermionic emission, is due to majority carriers (electrons in this $n$-type case) having sufficient thermal energy to surmount the potential barrier $\\Phi_{B}$ at the metal-semiconductor interface. The net current density $J$ is the difference between the electron flow from the semiconductor to the metal, $J_{S \\to M}$, and the flow from the metal to the semiconductor, $J_{M \\to S}$.\n\nThe general expression for the current density is given by:\n$$\nJ = A^{*}T^{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{q\\Phi_{B}}{k_{B}T}\\right) \\left[ \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV}{nk_{B}T}\\right) - 1 \\right]\n$$\nHere, $A^{*}$ is the effective Richardson constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $q$ is the elementary charge, $\\Phi_{B}$ is the zero-bias barrier height, $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $V$ is the applied voltage, and $n$ is the ideality factor.\n\nThe problem specifies the diode is in forward bias. We must check if the simplification for forward bias is applicable. The thermal energy is $k_{B}T$. The term in the exponential is $\\frac{qV}{nk_{B}T}$. Given $V = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{V}$, $T=350\\,\\mathrm{K}$, and $n=1.05$:\n$$\n\\frac{qV}{nk_{B}T} = \\frac{1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C} \\times 0.30\\,\\mathrm{V}}{1.05 \\times 1.381 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K} \\times 350\\,\\mathrm{K}} \\approx 9.47\n$$\nSince $\\exp(9.47) \\gg 1$, the term $-1$ in the general expression can be neglected. The forward current density is thus accurately approximated by:\n$$\nJ \\approx A^{*}T^{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{q\\Phi_{B}}{k_{B}T}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV}{nk_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nCombining the exponential terms, we get the desired expression for the forward current density:\n$$\nJ = A^{*}T^{2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV}{nk_{B}T} - \\frac{q\\Phi_{B}}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\n\n**Derivation of Logarithmic Sensitivity ($S$)**\n\nThe local logarithmic sensitivity $S$ is defined as $S \\equiv \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\Phi_{B}}\\left(\\ln J\\right)$, where $\\Phi_{B}$ is treated in units of electronvolts (eV).\n\nFirst, we take the natural logarithm of the forward current density expression derived above:\n$$\n\\ln J = \\ln\\left[ A^{*}T^{2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV}{nk_{B}T} - \\frac{q\\Phi_{B}}{k_{B}T}\\right) \\right] = \\ln(A^{*}T^{2}) + \\frac{qV}{nk_{B}T} - \\frac{q\\Phi_{B}}{k_{B}T}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the derivative is with respect to $\\Phi_B$ in units of eV. It is convenient to express the energy barrier $q\\Phi_{B}$ and thermal energy $k_B T$ in terms of eV. Let $k_{B,e} = k_B/q$ be the Boltzmann constant in $\\mathrm{eV/K}$. Then the term $\\frac{q\\Phi_B}{k_B T}$ can be re-written as $\\frac{\\Phi_{B,V}}{k_{B,e}T}$, where $\\Phi_{B,V}$ is the barrier height potential in Volts. The numerical value of $\\Phi_{B}$ in eV is identical to the numerical value of $\\Phi_{B,V}$ in Volts. Let's denote the barrier height in eV simply as $\\Phi_B$, as per the problem's convention. The expression for $\\ln J$ becomes:\n$$\n\\ln J = \\ln(A^{*}T^{2}) + \\frac{V}{nk_{B,e}T} - \\frac{\\Phi_{B}}{k_{B,e}T}\n$$\nIn this equation, $V$ is in Volts and $\\Phi_B$ is in eV. The terms in the expression are all dimensionless.\n\nNow, we compute the derivative with respect to $\\Phi_B$:\n$$\nS = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\Phi_{B}} \\left( \\ln(A^{*}T^{2}) + \\frac{V}{nk_{B,e}T} - \\frac{\\Phi_{B}}{k_{B,e}T} \\right)\n$$\nSince $A^{*}$, $T$, $V$, $n$, and $k_{B,e}$ are all independent of $\\Phi_B$, the derivative of the first two terms is zero.\n$$\nS = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\Phi_{B}} \\left( - \\frac{\\Phi_{B}}{k_{B,e}T} \\right) = -\\frac{1}{k_{B,e}T}\n$$\nThis is the analytical expression for the sensitivity $S$. The units are inverse energy, or $\\mathrm{eV^{-1}}$.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n-   $A^{*} = 112\\,\\mathrm{A\\,cm^{-2}\\,K^{-2}}$\n-   $\\Phi_{B} = 0.70\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n-   $n = 1.05$\n-   $T = 350\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n-   $V = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n\nWe use the standard values for the constants:\n-   $q = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n-   $k_{B} = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K}$\n-   $k_{B,e} = k_B/q \\approx 8.617333 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV/K}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the thermal energy in electronvolts:\n$$\nk_{B,e}T = (8.617333 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV/K}) \\times (350\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 0.03016067\\,\\mathrm{eV}\n$$\n\n**Calculation of Sensitivity $S$**:\nUsing the derived expression $S = -\\frac{1}{k_{B,e}T}$:\n$$\nS = -\\frac{1}{0.03016067\\,\\mathrm{eV}} \\approx -33.1557\\,\\mathrm{eV^{-1}}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\nS \\approx -33.16\\,\\mathrm{eV^{-1}}\n$$\n\n**Calculation of Forward Current Density $J$**:\nUsing the derived expression $J = A^{*}T^{2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V}{nk_{B,e}T} - \\frac{\\Phi_{B}}{k_{B,e}T}\\right)$:\nThe pre-exponential factor is:\n$$\nA^{*}T^{2} = (112\\,\\mathrm{A\\,cm^{-2}\\,K^{-2}}) \\times (350\\,\\mathrm{K})^{2} = 112 \\times 122500\\,\\mathrm{A\\,cm^{-2}} = 1.372 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{A\\,cm^{-2}}\n$$\nThe argument of the exponential function is:\n$$\n\\frac{V}{nk_{B,e}T} - \\frac{\\Phi_{B}}{k_{B,e}T} = \\frac{0.30\\,\\mathrm{V}}{1.05 \\times 0.03016067\\,\\mathrm{eV}} - \\frac{0.70\\,\\mathrm{eV}}{0.03016067\\,\\mathrm{eV}}\n$$\n$$\n\\approx \\frac{0.30}{0.0316687} - 23.2091 \\approx 9.47306 - 23.20914 \\approx -13.73608\n$$\nNow, we calculate $J$:\n$$\nJ \\approx (1.372 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{A\\,cm^{-2}}) \\times \\exp(-13.73608)\n$$\n$$\nJ \\approx (1.372 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{A\\,cm^{-2}}) \\times (1.08278 \\times 10^{-6}) \\approx 14.8556\\,\\mathrm{A\\,cm^{-2}}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\nJ \\approx 14.86\\,\\mathrm{A\\,cm^{-2}}\n$$\n\nThe final numerical results are $J = 14.86\\,\\mathrm{A/cm^{2}}$ and $S = -33.16\\,\\mathrm{eV^{-1}}$.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It describes a standard electrothermal stability problem in a power semiconductor device using established physical models and realistic parameter values. All necessary information for a rigorous analysis is provided. The problem is valid.\n\nThe core of the problem is to assess the stability of a thermal equilibrium point for a reverse-biased Schottky diode. An equilibrium is stable if the system returns to it after a small perturbation. In this electrothermal system, thermal runaway occurs if a small increase in junction temperature, $\\delta T_j$, leads to an increase in dissipated power, $\\delta P_{diss}$, that causes an even larger temperature increase, leading to a positive feedback loop and uncontrolled temperature rise.\n\nThe steady-state junction temperature, $T_j$, is determined by the balance between the heat generated within the device, $P_{diss}$, and the heat removed to the ambient, $P_{cool}$.\nThe power generated (dissipated) in the diode under a constant reverse voltage $V_R$ is:\n$$P_{diss}(T_j) = V_R I_R(T_j)$$\nThe heat removed from the junction to the ambient is described by the linear thermal model:\n$$P_{cool}(T_j) = \\frac{T_j - T_a}{\\theta_{JA}}$$\nAt a stable equilibrium point, not only must generation equal cooling ($P_{diss} = P_{cool}$), but any small increase in temperature must result in a greater increase in cooling than in heating. The condition for local thermal stability is therefore:\n$$\\frac{d P_{diss}}{d T_j}  \\frac{d P_{cool}}{d T_j}$$\nLet's evaluate both derivatives. The derivative of the cooling power is:\n$$\\frac{d P_{cool}}{d T_j} = \\frac{d}{d T_j} \\left( \\frac{T_j - T_a}{\\theta_{JA}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\theta_{JA}}$$\nThe derivative of the dissipated power is:\n$$\\frac{d P_{diss}}{d T_j} = \\frac{d}{d T_j} \\left( V_R I_R(T_j) \\right) = V_R \\frac{d I_R}{d T_j}$$\nSo, the stability condition is:\n$$V_R \\frac{d I_R}{d T_j}  \\frac{1}{\\theta_{JA}}$$\nThis can be rearranged to define a dimensionless small-signal electrothermal loop gain, $G$:\n$$G = \\theta_{JA} V_R \\frac{d I_R}{d T_j}$$\nThe system is locally stable if $G  1$, unstable if $G  1$, and marginally stable if $G = 1$.\n\nTo evaluate $G$ at the specified operating point, we must first find the derivative $\\frac{d I_R}{d T_j}$.

A loop gain greater than unity signifies an unstable equilibrium. The statement is therefore consistent with our first-principles derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Reducing $\\theta_{JA}$ to any value below $100\\,\\text{K/W}$, while holding $V_R$ and the leakage law fixed, guarantees local thermal stability at the same operating point.**\nThe condition for stability is $G  1$, which translates to $\\theta_{JA} V_R \\frac{d I_R}{d T_j}  1$. This means that for stability at the operating point $T_j = 400\\,\\text{K}$, the thermal resistance must satisfy:\n$$ \\theta_{JA}  \\frac{1}{V_R \\frac{d I_R}{d T_j}} $$\nUsing our previously calculated value for $V_R \\frac{d I_R}{d T_j} = (100\\,\\text{V})(8.253 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{A/K}) \\approx 0.008253\\,\\text{W/K}$:\n$$ \\theta_{JA}  \\frac{1}{0.008253\\,\\text{W/K}} \\approx 121.17\\,\\text{K/W} $$\nThe statement suggests reducing $\\theta_{JA}$ to a value below $100\\,\\text{K/W}$. Since any value of $\\theta_{JA}  100\\,\\text{K/W}$ is also less than the critical value of approximately $121.17\\,\\text{K/W}$, this action would indeed ensure that the loop gain $G$ is less than $1$, guaranteeing local thermal stability.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. Adding a resistor–capacitor (RC) snubber across the diode that leaves the direct current (DC) reverse voltage essentially unchanged will not materially affect the DC thermal runaway condition; the runaway criterion depends on the steady $V_R$ and the temperature derivative of leakage.**\nThermal runaway is a DC or quasi-static phenomenon determined by the steady-state balance of power generation and dissipation. An RC snubber is a circuit element designed to shape transient voltage and current waveforms, for instance, during switching events, to prevent device failure from high $dV/dt$ or overvoltage. In a steady-state DC condition, the capacitor in the snubber acts as an open circuit. The resistor is in parallel with the diode. If the problem states the DC reverse voltage $V_R$ is \"essentially unchanged,\" this means the snubber does not alter the DC bias conditions of the diode. The thermal runaway criterion $G = \\theta_{JA} V_R \\frac{d I_R}{d T_j}  1$ depends only on the DC voltage $V_R$, the device's thermal resistance $\\theta_{JA}$, and its leakage current characteristic $I_R(T_j)$ (specifically its derivative). Since the snubber does not affect these DC parameters, it will not materially alter the DC thermal runaway condition.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. Choosing a lower Schottky barrier height $\\Phi_B$ device (to reduce forward drop) mitigates runaway because it decreases the effective activation energy $E_a$ and thus reduces $\\frac{d I_R}{d T_j}$.**\nThis statement makes two claims: that a lower $E_a$ (resulting from a lower $\\Phi_B$) reduces $\\frac{d I_R}{d T_j}$, and that this mitigates runaway. Let's examine the first claim. The derivative is $\\frac{d I_R}{d T_j} = C \\exp(-\\frac{E_a}{k_B T_j}) ( 2T_j + \\frac{E_a}{k_B} )$. To see how this expression changes with $E_a$, let's take its derivative with respect to $E_a$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dE_a}\\left(\\frac{d I_R}{d T_j}\\right) = C \\frac{d}{dE_a}\\left[ \\left(2T_j + \\frac{E_a}{k_B}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{k_B T_j}\\right) \\right] $$\n$$ = C \\left[ \\frac{1}{k_B}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{k_B T_j}\\right) + \\left(2T_j + \\frac{E_a}{k_B}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{k_B T_j}\\right) \\left(-\\frac{1}{k_B T_j}\\right) \\right] $$\n$$ = \\frac{C}{k_B} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{k_B T_j}\\right) \\left[ 1 - \\left(2 + \\frac{E_a}{k_B T_j}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{C}{k_B} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{k_B T_j}\\right) \\left[ -1 - \\frac{E_a}{k_B T_j} \\right] $$\nSince all terms $C$, $k_B$, $T_j$, and $E_a$ are positive, the term in the brackets is negative, and thus $\\frac{d}{dE_a}(\\frac{d I_R}{d T_j})$ is negative. This means that as $E_a$ decreases, $\\frac{d I_R}{d T_j}$ *increases*. Therefore, a lower barrier height *increases* the temperature sensitivity of the leakage current. This, in turn, increases the loop gain $G$ and makes thermal runaway *more* likely, not less. The statement's central line of reasoning is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Inserting a series resistor $R_s$ in the reverse path so that the diode sees $V_D = V_{\\text{sup}} - I_R R_s$ under reverse bias introduces negative electrothermal feedback; if $R_s$ is sized so that the voltage across the diode decreases appreciably as $I_R$ rises, the electrothermal loop gain is reduced and runaway can be prevented.**\nWith a series resistor $R_s$ and a supply voltage $V_{sup}$, the voltage across the diode $V_D$ is no longer constant but depends on the current: $V_D(T_j) = V_{sup} - I_R(T_j) R_s$. The power dissipated *in the diode* is now $P_{diss}(T_j) = V_D(T_j) I_R(T_j) = (V_{sup} - I_R(T_j) R_s) I_R(T_j)$.\nThe derivative of the dissipated power becomes:\n$$ \\frac{d P_{diss}}{d T_j} = \\frac{d}{d T_j} [V_{sup} I_R - I_R^2 R_s] = V_{sup} \\frac{d I_R}{d T_j} - 2 I_R R_s \\frac{d I_R}{d T_j} = (V_{sup} - 2 I_R R_s) \\frac{d I_R}{d T_j} $$\nWe can rewrite this using $V_D = V_{sup} - I_R R_s$:\n$$ \\frac{d P_{diss}}{d T_j} = (V_D - I_R R_s) \\frac{d I_R}{d T_j} $$\nThe new loop gain is $G' = \\theta_{JA} (V_D - I_R R_s) \\frac{d I_R}{d T_j}$. Compared to the original gain $G = \\theta_{JA} V_D \\frac{d I_R}{d T_j}$ (for a fixed voltage $V_D$), the new gain $G'$ is smaller by a factor of $\\theta_{JA} I_R R_s \\frac{d I_R}{d T_j}$. This reduction is a form of negative feedback: a rise in $T_j \\rightarrow$ a rise in $I_R \\rightarrow$ a fall in $V_D$, which counteracts the power increase. If $R_s$ is sufficiently large, this negative feedback can reduce the total loop gain $G'$ below $1$, thus preventing runaway. The statement accurately describes this mechanism.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\nFinal list of correct statements: A, B, C, E.",

            "problem": "A single-phase step-down direct current to direct current converter employing Schottky rectification is analyzed under steady-state continuous inductor current. The objective is to construct a computational model that predicts efficiency by combining conduction loss in the Schottky diode, energy associated with charging its voltage-dependent junction capacitance during each switching cycle, and the thermal feedback on the diode’s forward conduction characteristics. The converter is ideal except for losses explicitly modeled.\n\nUse the following fundamental bases without invoking any shortcut expressions not derived from first principles:\n- The ideal duty ratio satisfies $D = V_{\\text{out}} / V_{\\text{in}}$ for a buck converter in steady state.\n- Average conduction power of a device equals average current times average voltage drop while the device conducts.\n- The energy stored in a capacitor up to a voltage $V$ with voltage-dependent capacitance $C(V)$ equals $\\displaystyle E(V) = \\int_{0}^{V} C(v)\\, v\\, dv$, and average power from cyclic charging equals energy per cycle multiplied by the switching frequency.\n- A linear thermal resistance model relates junction temperature $T_{\\text{j}}$ to ambient temperature $T_{\\text{a}}$ by $\\displaystyle T_{\\text{j}} = T_{\\text{a}} + R_{\\theta \\text{JA}}\\, P_{\\text{d}}$, where $P_{\\text{d}}$ is the diode’s power dissipation and $R_{\\theta \\text{JA}}$ is the junction-to-ambient thermal resistance.\n- The forward voltage of the Schottky diode is modeled as $\\displaystyle V_{\\text{f}}(I, T) = V_{d0}(T) + I\\, R_{s}(T)$, where $\\displaystyle R_{s}(T) = R_{s0}\\big(1 + \\alpha_{R}(T - T_{\\text{ref}})\\big)$ and $\\displaystyle V_{d0}(T) = V_{d0,\\text{ref}} - \\beta_{\\phi}(T - T_{\\text{ref}})$. The junction capacitance is modeled as $\\displaystyle C(V) = \\dfrac{C_{j0}}{\\big(1 + V/V_{\\text{bi}}\\big)^{m}}$ with $m \\in (0, 1]$.\n\nAssume constant output current $I_{\\text{out}}$ with negligible ripple and ignore reverse leakage and reverse recovery in the Schottky diode. The diode conducts during the fraction $1 - D$ of each cycle carrying current $I_{\\text{out}}$, and is reverse-biased to approximately $V_{\\text{in}}$ during the fraction $D$. Treat the dynamic energy associated with charging the junction capacitance from $0$ to $V_{\\text{in}}$ once per cycle as a converter loss that does not heat the diode. Thermal feedback affects conduction loss through $V_{\\text{f}}(I, T)$, and the diode junction temperature must be determined self-consistently.\n\nYour task is to write a program that, for each test case, performs the following computations:\n1. Compute the duty ratio $D$.\n2. Determine the conduction loss $P_{\\text{cond}}$ using a self-consistent solution for the junction temperature $T_{\\text{j}}$ given the thermal resistance model and temperature-dependent forward characteristics. This requires solving the fixed-point relation $\\displaystyle T_{\\text{j}} = T_{\\text{a}} + R_{\\theta \\text{JA}}\\, P_{\\text{cond}}$ with $\\displaystyle P_{\\text{cond}} = (1 - D)\\, I_{\\text{out}}\\, V_{\\text{f}}(I_{\\text{out}}, T_{\\text{j}})$.\n3.

Report the efficiency $\\displaystyle \\eta = P_{\\text{out}} / P_{\\text{in}}$ as a decimal number.\n\nAngle units are not involved. Physical quantities must be handled in coherent SI units: volt (V), ampere (A), hertz (Hz), kelvin (K), ohm ($\\Omega$), watt (W), and farad (F). Express each efficiency as a decimal number rounded to six decimal places.\n\nImplement the integral for $\\displaystyle E_{\\text{cap}}$ using a numerically stable method that is valid for the provided parameters, and solve the thermal fixed point to a tolerance specified below.\n\nConvergence criteria for the thermal fixed point: terminate when the absolute change in $\\displaystyle T_{\\text{j}}$ between successive iterations is less than $10^{-9}$ K or when the iteration count reaches $1000$; use the last iterate in the latter case.\n\nThe program must process the following test suite. Each test case is a tuple of parameters $(V_{\\text{in}}, V_{\\text{out}}, I_{\\text{out}}, f_{\\text{sw}}, T_{\\text{a}}, R_{\\theta \\text{JA}}, V_{d0,\\text{ref}}, R_{s0}, \\alpha_{R}, \\beta_{\\phi}, T_{\\text{ref}}, C_{j0}, V_{\\text{bi}}, m)$:\n- Test case $1$: $(12, 5, 3, 200000, 298.15, 30, 0.35, 0.02, 0.004, 0.0009, 298.15, 1\\times 10^{-9}, 0.7, 0.5)$.\n- Test case $2$: $(12, 5, 3, 1000000, 298.15, 30, 0.35, 0.02, 0.004, 0.0009, 298.15, 1\\times 10^{-9}, 0.7, 0.5)$.\n- Test case $3$: $(12, 5, 5, 200000, 333.15, 50, 0.35, 0.02, 0.004, 0.0009, 298.15, 1.5\\times 10^{-9}, 0.7, 0.5)$.\n- Test case $4$: $(10, 9, 1.5, 300000, 298.15, 25, 0.35, 0.02, 0.004, 0.0009, 298.15, 0.8\\times 10^{-9}, 0.7, 0.5)$.\n- Test case $5$: $(24, 2, 2, 100000, 298.15, 35, 0.35, 0.02, 0.004, 0.0009, 298.15, 1.2\\times 10^{-9}, 0.7, 0.5)$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (for example, $\\,[\\text{result}_{1},\\text{result}_{2},\\text{result}_{3}]$).

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and well-posed. The provided models for the converter and its components are standard, albeit simplified, representations used in power electronics analysis. The parameters are physically realistic, and the computational task is clearly defined. We will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute the efficiency, $\\eta$, of a step-down DC-DC converter. The efficiency is defined as the ratio of output power, $P_{\\text{out}}$, to input power, $P_{\\text{in}}$:\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{P_{\\text{out}}}{P_{\\text{in}}}\n$$\nThe output power is given by $P_{\\text{out}} = V_{\\text{out}} I_{\\text{out}}$. The input power is the sum of the output power and the total power losses, $P_{\\text{loss}}$: $P_{\\text{in}} = P_{\\text{out}} + P_{\\text{loss}}$. The problem specifies two loss mechanisms to be considered: conduction loss in the Schottky diode, $P_{\\text{cond}}$, and power loss due to charging the diode's junction capacitance, $P_{\\text{cap}}$. Therefore, $P_{\\text{loss}} = P_{\\text{cond}} + P_{\\text{cap}}$.\n\nOur computational procedure is as follows:\n1.  Calculate the ideal duty ratio, $D$.\n2.  Determine the diode conduction loss, $P_{\\text{cond}}$, which requires a self-consistent calculation of the diode junction temperature, $T_{\\text{j}}$.\n3.  Calculate the capacitive loss power, $P_{\\text{cap}}$.\n4.  Combine these components to find the total input power, $P_{\\text{in}}$, and the efficiency, $\\eta$.\n\n**1. Duty Ratio**\nFor an ideal buck converter operating in continuous conduction mode, the relationship between input voltage, $V_{\\text{in}}$, output voltage, $V_{\\text{out}}$, and the duty ratio, $D$, of the main switch is:\n$$\nD = \\frac{V_{\\text{out}}}{V_{\\text{in}}}\n$$\nThe freewheeling diode (our Schottky diode) conducts when the main switch is off, which occurs for a fraction $1 - D$ of the switching period.\n\n**2. Conduction Loss and Thermal Fixed-Point Calculation**\nThe average conduction power loss in the diode, $P_{\\text{cond}}$, is the product of the average current through it during its conduction interval and the average voltage across it during that interval, multiplied by the fraction of the period it conducts. Assuming the output current $I_{\\text{out}}$ is constant, the diode carries this current for a time fraction of $1-D$.\n$$\nP_{\\text{cond}} = (1 - D) I_{\\text{out}} V_{\\text{f}}(I_{\\text{out}}, T_{\\text{j}})\n$$\nHere, $V_{\\text{f}}(I, T)$ is the diode's forward voltage drop, which depends on both current and temperature. The problem provides a linear model for $V_{\\text{f}}$:\n$$\nV_{\\text{f}}(I, T) = V_{d0}(T) + I R_{s}(T)\n$$\nThe zero-bias voltage, $V_{d0}(T)$, and the series resistance, $R_{s}(T)$, are themselves temperature-dependent:\n$$\nV_{d0}(T) = V_{d0,\\text{ref}} - \\beta_{\\phi}(T - T_{\\text{ref}})\n$$\n$$\nR_{s}(T) = R_{s0}\\big(1 + \\alpha_{R}(T - T_{\\text{ref}})\\big)\n$$\nThe power dissipated in the diode as heat, $P_{\\text{d}}$, which we take to be solely the conduction loss $P_{\\text{cond}}$, raises the diode's junction temperature, $T_{\\text{j}}$, above the ambient temperature, $T_{\\text{a}}$. This relationship is described by the linear thermal model:\n$$\nT_{\\text{j}} = T_{\\text{a}} + R_{\\theta \\text{JA}} P_{\\text{d}} = T_{\\text{a}} + R_{\\theta \\text{JA}} P_{\\text{cond}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P_{\\text{cond}}$ into the thermal equation reveals a self-consistent relationship for $T_{\\text{j}}$:\n$$\nT_{\\text{j}} = T_{\\text{a}} + R_{\\theta \\text{JA}} (1 - D) I_{\\text{out}} V_{\\text{f}}(I_{\\text{out}}, T_{\\text{j}})\n$$\nThis is a fixed-point equation of the form $T_{\\text{j}} = g(T_{\\text{j}})$. We solve it numerically using successive substitution. Let $T_{\\text{j},k}$ be the estimate of the junction temperature at iteration $k$. The next estimate, $T_{\\text{j},k+1}$, is computed as:\n$$\nT_{\\text{j},k+1} = T_{\\text{a}} + R_{\\theta \\text{JA}} (1 - D) I_{\\text{out}} \\left[ \\left(V_{d0,\\text{ref}} - \\beta_{\\phi}(T_{\\text{j},k} - T_{\\text{ref}})\\right) + I_{\\text{out}} R_{s0}\\big(1 + \\alpha_{R}(T_{\\text{j},k} - T_{\\text{ref}})\\big) \\right]\n$$\nThe iteration begins with an initial guess, typically $T_{\\text{j},0} = T_{\\text{a}}$, and continues until the change between successive iterates, $|T_{\\text{j},k+1} - T_{\\text{j},k}|$, falls below a specified tolerance of $10^{-9}$ K, or a maximum number of iterations ($1000$) is reached. Once $T_{\\text{j}}$ converges, the final $P_{\\text{cond}}$ is calculated.\n\n**3. Capacitive Loss**\nDuring each switching cycle, the diode's junction capacitance is charged from approximately $0$ V to $V_{\\text{in}}$. The energy stored in a voltage-dependent capacitor is given by the integral:\n$$\nE_{\\text{cap}} = \\int_{0}^{V_{\\text{in}}} C(v) v \\, dv\n$$\nThe capacitance model is given by $C(v) = \\frac{C_{j0}}{(1+v/V_{\\text{bi}})^m}$. Substituting this into the energy integral:\n$$\nE_{\\text{cap}} = C_{j0} \\int_{0}^{V_{\\text{in}}} \\frac{v}{(1+v/V_{\\text{bi}})^m} \\, dv\n$$\nThis integral can be solved analytically. Let $u = 1 + v/V_{\\text{bi}}$. This implies $v = V_{\\text{bi}}(u-1)$ and $dv = V_{\\text{bi}} du$. The integration limits change from $v=0 \\implies u=1$ and $v=V_{\\text{in}} \\implies u = 1 + V_{\\text{in}}/V_{\\text{bi}}$.\n$$\nE_{\\text{cap}} = C_{j0} \\int_{1}^{1+V_{\\text{in}}/V_{\\text{bi}}} \\frac{V_{\\text{bi}}(u-1)}{u^m} V_{\\text{bi}} \\, du = C_{j0} V_{\\text{bi}}^2 \\int_{1}^{1+V_{\\text{in}}/V_{\\text{bi}}} (u^{1-m} - u^{-m}) \\, du\n$$\nFor the case where $m \\neq 1$ and $m \\neq 2$ (which covers $m=0.5$ in the test cases), the integral evaluates to:\n$$\nE_{\\text{cap}} = C_{j0} V_{\\text{bi}}^2 \\left[ \\frac{u^{2-m}}{2-m} - \\frac{u^{1-m}}{1-m} \\right]_{1}^{1+V_{\\text{in}}/V_{\\text{bi}}}\n$$\nLetting $u_{\\text{max}} = 1 + V_{\\text{in}}/V_{\\text{bi}}$, the definite integral gives:\n$$\nE_{\\text{cap}} = C_{j0} V_{\\text{bi}}^2 \\left( \\left(\\frac{u_{\\text{max}}^{2-m}}{2-m} - \\frac{u_{\\text{max}}^{1-m}}{1-m}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{2-m} - \\frac{1}{1-m}\\right) \\right)\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\nE_{\\text{cap}} = C_{j0} V_{\\text{bi}}^2 \\left( \\frac{u_{\\text{max}}^{2-m} - 1}{2-m} - \\frac{u_{\\text{max}}^{1-m} - 1}{1-m} \\right)\n$$\nThe average power loss associated with this cyclic charging is the energy per cycle multiplied by the switching frequency, $f_{\\text{sw}}$:\n$$\nP_{\\text{cap}} = f_{\\text{sw}} E_{\\text{cap}}\n$$\n\n**4. Efficiency Calculation**\nWith all components determined, the efficiency is computed by summing the powers:\n$$\nP_{\\text{out}} = V_{\\text{out}} I_{\\text{out}}\n$$\n$$\nP_{\\text{in}} = P_{\\text{out}} + P_{\\text{cond}} + P_{\\text{cap}}\n$$\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{P_{\\text{out}}}{P_{\\text{in}}}\n$$\nThe following program implements this sequence of calculations for each test case provided.",
