In this analogy, temperature difference ($\\Delta T$) is analogous to voltage drop ($V$), heat flow rate (power dissipation, $P$) is analogous to electric current ($I$), and thermal resistance ($R_{\\theta}$) is analogous to electrical resistance ($R$). The governing equation is therefore analogous to Ohm's Law:\n$$ \\Delta T = P \\cdot R_{\\theta} $$\n\nThe thermal path from the transistor junction to the ambient air is described as consisting of two segments in series: the path from the junction to the case, and the path from the case to the ambient. The corresponding thermal resistances are the junction-to-case thermal resistance, $R_{\\theta JC}$, and the case-to-ambient thermal resistance, $R_{\\theta CA}$.\n\nFor components in a series thermal network, the total thermal resistance is the sum of the individual resistances. Therefore, the total junction-to-ambient thermal resistance, $R_{\\theta JA}$, is given by:\n$$ R_{\\theta JA} = R_{\\theta JC} + R_{\\theta CA} $$\n\nThe problem provides the following numerical values for the thermal resistances:\n$$ R_{\\theta JC} = 0.42\\ \\mathrm{K/W} $$\n$$ R_{\\theta CA} = 2.58\\ \\mathrm{K/W} $$\n\nSubstituting these values, we calculate the total thermal resistance:\n$$ R_{\\theta JA} = 0.42\\ \\mathrm{K/W} + 2.58\\ \\mathrm{K/W} = 3.00\\ \\mathrm{K/W} $$\n\nThe total temperature rise from junction to ambient, $\\Delta T$, is related to the total power dissipated, $P$, and the total thermal resistance, $R_{\\theta JA}$, by the equation:\n$$ \\Delta T = P \\cdot R_{\\theta JA} $$\n\nThe problem requires determining the maximum allowable direct current power dissipation, $P_{\\mathrm{max}}$, for which the junction-to-ambient temperature rise does not exceed a specified maximum value, $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{max}}$. The given constraint is:\n$$ \\Delta T \\leq 22\\ \\mathrm{K} $$\nThus, $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{max}} = 22\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n\nTo find $P_{\\mathrm{max}}$, we rearrange the thermal equation:\n$$ P = \\frac{\\Delta T}{R_{\\theta JA}} $$\nThe maximum power, $P_{\\mathrm{max}}$, corresponds to the maximum temperature rise, $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{max}}$:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\frac{\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{max}}}{R_{\\theta JA}} $$\n\nSubstituting the known values for $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{max}}$ and $R_{\\theta JA}$:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\frac{22\\ \\mathrm{K}}{3.00\\ \\mathrm{K/W}} $$\n\nPerforming the division yields the numerical result for the maximum power dissipation:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\frac{22}{3}\\ \\mathrm{W} \\approx 7.3333...\\ \\mathrm{W} $$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{max}} \\approx 7.333\\ \\mathrm{W} $$",

They are related by the ideal (low-injection) current gain, $B_F$:\n$$I_{B,ideal} = \\frac{I_{C,ideal}}{B_F}$$\nThe problem states that the high-current roll-off is due to an increase in the effective base charge. In the Gummel-Poon model, this is captured by the normalized base charge factor, $q_b$. This factor modifies the ideal currents to give the actual terminal currents. The actual collector current $I_C$ is given by:\n$$I_C = \\frac{I_{C,ideal}}{q_b}$$\nFor the purpose of modeling the high-current gain roll-off, we can approximate the base current $I_B$ by its dominant ideal component, since other base current components are more significant at low currents.\n$$I_B \\approx I_{B,ideal} = \\frac{I_{C,ideal}}{B_F}$$\nFrom the equation for $I_C$, we can express the ideal collector current as $I_{C,ideal} = I_C \\cdot q_b$. Substituting this into the expression for $I_B$:\n$$I_B \\approx \\frac{I_C \\cdot q_b}{B_F}$$\nThe current gain $\\beta$ is the ratio of the actual terminal currents $I_C$ and $I_B$:\n$$\\beta = \\frac{I_C}{I_B} \\approx \\frac{I_C}{\\frac{I_C \\cdot q_b}{B_F}} = \\frac{B_F}{q_b}$$\nThis key result shows that the current gain at any operating point is the ideal gain $B_F$ divided by the normalized base charge factor $q_b$. The roll-off of $\\beta$ is therefore determined by the behavior of $q_b$.\n\nThe normalized base charge $q_b$ accounts for charge storage effects. For high-level injection, neglecting the Early effect (as specified), the standard Gummel-Poon formulation for $q_b$ simplifies. The derivation leads to the following expression for $q_b$ in terms of the collector current $I_C$ and the forward high-injection knee current $I_{KF}$:\n$$q_b = 1 + \\frac{I_C}{I_{KF}}$$\nThis equation shows that at low currents ($I_C \\ll I_{KF}$), $q_b \\approx 1$, and at high currents ($I_C \\gg I_{KF}$), $q_b$ increases linearly with $I_C$.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $q_b$ into our equation for $\\beta$, we obtain the required parametric dependence of $\\beta$ on $I_C$:\n$$\\beta = \\frac{B_F}{1 + \\frac{I_C}{I_{KF}}}$$\n\nTo extract the parameters `BF` and `IKF` from the given data, we must linearize this equation. We can achieve this by taking the reciprocal of $\\beta$:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\beta} = \\frac{1 + \\frac{I_C}{I_{KF}}}{B_F}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{\\beta} = \\frac{1}{B_F} + \\frac{1}{B_F \\cdot I_{KF}} I_C$$\nThis equation is in the linear form $y = c + mx$, where:\n- $y = \\frac{1}{\\beta}$\n- $x = I_C$\n- The y-intercept is $c = \\frac{1}{B_F}$\n- The slope is $m = \\frac{1}{B_F \\cdot I_{KF}}$\n\nA plot of $\\frac{1}{\\beta}$ versus $I_C$ should yield a straight line, from which we can determine `BF` and `IKF`. We are given six data points $(I_C, \\beta)$. Since the problem is likely constructed from an ideal model, we can solve for the two unknowns, $m$ and $c$, using any two data points. Let's use two points with convenient numerical values:\n- Point 4: $(I_{C4}, \\beta_4) = (1.00, 80.000)$. This gives a transformed point $(x_4, y_4) = (1.00, \\frac{1}{80.000}) = (1.00, 0.0125)$.\n- Point 6: $(I_{C6}, \\beta_6) = (4.00, 40.000)$. This gives a transformed point $(x_6, y_6) = (4.00, \\frac{1}{40.000}) = (4.00, 0.025)$.\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations:\n1) $0.0125 = c + m \\cdot (1.00)$\n2) $0.025 = c + m \\cdot (4.00)$\n\nSubtracting equation (1) from equation (2):\n$(0.025 - 0.0125) = (c - c) + m \\cdot (4.00 - 1.00)$\n$0.0125 = 3.00 \\cdot m$\n$$m = \\frac{0.0125}{3.00} = \\frac{1/80}{3} = \\frac{1}{240}$$\nNow, substitute the value of $m$ back into equation (1):\n$0.0125 = c + \\frac{1}{240} \\cdot (1.00)$\n$c = 0.0125 - \\frac{1}{240} = \\frac{1}{80} - \\frac{1}{240} = \\frac{3}{240} - \\frac{1}{240} = \\frac{2}{240} = \\frac{1}{120}$\n\nWe have found the slope $m = \\frac{1}{240}$ and the intercept $c = \\frac{1}{120}$. Now we can find the parameter values:\n$$B_F = \\frac{1}{c} = \\frac{1}{1/120} = 120$$\n$$I_{KF} = \\frac{1}{m \\cdot B_F} = \\frac{1}{(\\frac{1}{240}) \\cdot 120} = \\frac{1}{120/240} = \\frac{1}{1/2} = 2$$\nThe extracted parameters are `BF` = 120 and `IKF` = 2 A. Let's verify these parameters against all data points using the model $\\beta = \\frac{120}{1+I_C/2}$.\n- $I_C = 0.05$: $\\beta = \\frac{120}{1+0.05/2} = \\frac{120}{1.025} \\approx 117.073$. Matches.\n- $I_C = 0.10$: $\\beta = \\frac{120}{1+0.10/2} = \\frac{120}{1.05} \\approx 114.286$. Matches.\n- $I_C = 0.50$: $\\beta = \\frac{120}{1+0.50/2} = \\frac{120}{1.25} = 96.000$. Matches.\n- $I_C = 1.00$: $\\beta = \\frac{120}{1+1.00/2} = \\frac{120}{1.5} = 80.000$. Matches.\n- $I_C = 2.00$: $\\beta = \\frac{120}{1+2.00/2} = \\frac{120}{2} = 60.000$. Matches.\n- $I_C = 4.00$: $\\beta = \\frac{120}{1+4.00/2} = \\frac{120}{3} = 40.000$. Matches.\nThe data are perfectly consistent with the model and the extracted parameters.\n\nFinally, we provide the physical interpretation of the parameters and the required numerical answer.\n\n**Physical Interpretation:**\n- **BF ($B_F$)**: This parameter represents the maximum forward static current gain. It is the ideal gain of the transistor in the forward-active region at low to moderate current levels, before high-injection effects become significant. Physically, it is determined by the manufacturing process of the transistor, specifically by the ratio of minority carrier lifetime in the base to the forward transit time across the base. A high value of `BF` indicates high amplification capability, corresponding to low recombination losses in the base region.\n- **IKF ($I_{KF}$)**: This parameter is the forward high-injection knee current. It defines the collector current level at which the current gain $\\beta$ begins to decrease due to high-level injection. Physically, `IKF` corresponds to the collector current at which the concentration of injected minority carriers in the base becomes comparable to the background majority carrier concentration (i.e., the doping level). For collector currents $I_C > I_{KF}$, the device operates in high-level injection, leading to a substantial increase in the total base charge and a consequent roll-off in current gain. As per the model, when $I_C = I_{KF}$, the gain drops to half of its maximum value, i.e., $\\beta = B_F/2$.\n\nThe problem requires the results to be rounded to four significant figures.\n`BF` = 120 becomes 120.0.\n`IKF` = 2 A becomes 2.000 A.\n\nThe final answer is presented as a row matrix containing these two values.",
