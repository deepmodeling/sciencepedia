            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It presents a standard problem in semiconductor device physics, suitable for analysis using established principles. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe primary task is to determine the donor concentration $N_{D}$ in the lightly doped $n$-region of a one-sided abrupt $p^{+}\\!-\\!n$ silicon diode using its measured small-signal AC admittance at two different reverse bias voltages.\n\n\\textbf{1. Derivation of Depletion Capacitance $C_{j}(V)$}\n\nWe begin by deriving the relationship between the junction depletion capacitance $C_{j}$ and the applied reverse bias voltage $V$. The derivation is based on the following physical assumptions:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item The junction is an ideal one-sided abrupt junction, meaning the acceptor concentration $N_{A}$ in the $p^{+}$ region is much greater than the donor concentration $N_{D}$ in the $n$ region ($N_{A} \\gg N_{D}$).\n    \\item The donor concentration $N_{D}$ is uniform throughout the $n$ region.\n    \\item The depletion approximation is valid. This implies that within the space-charge region (SCR), the mobile carrier concentrations (electrons and holes) are negligible compared to the ionized dopant concentrations. It also assumes that the boundaries of the SCR are sharp.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nUnder these assumptions, the SCR extends almost entirely into the lightly doped $n$-side. Let the width of the SCR in the $n$-side be $W$. We can set the metallurgical junction at $x=0$. The SCR then occupies the region $0 < x < W$.\n\nWe start from Poisson's equation in one dimension, which is the differential form of Gauss's law:\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\varepsilon_{s}} $$\nwhere $\\psi(x)$ is the electrostatic potential, $\\rho(x)$ is the net space charge density, and $\\varepsilon_{s}$ is the permittivity of silicon.\n\nWithin the SCR on the $n$-side ($0 < x < W$), the space charge is due to the ionized donor atoms, so $\\rho(x) = q N_{D}$, where $q$ is the elementary charge. Poisson's equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} = -\\frac{qN_{D}}{\\varepsilon_{s}} $$\nWe integrate this equation once with respect to $x$ to find the electric field $E(x) = -d\\psi/dx$. The boundary condition is that the electric field must be zero at the edge of the depletion region, $E(W)=0$.\n$$ \\frac{d\\psi(x)}{dx} = -\\frac{qN_{D}}{\\varepsilon_{s}}x + C_{1} $$\nApplying $E(W)=0 \\implies -(-d\\psi/dx)|_{x=W}=0$:\n$$ \\frac{qN_{D}}{\\varepsilon_{s}}W - C_{1} = 0 \\implies C_{1} = \\frac{qN_{D}W}{\\varepsilon_{s}} $$\nSo, the electric field is:\n$$ E(x) = -\\frac{d\\psi(x)}{dx} = \\frac{qN_{D}}{\\varepsilon_{s}}(W-x) $$\nIntegrating again to find the potential $\\psi(x)$, with the boundary condition $\\psi(0)=0$:\n$$ \\psi(x) = -\\int_{0}^{x} E(x')dx' = -\\frac{qN_{D}}{\\varepsilon_{s}} \\int_{0}^{x} (W-x')dx' = -\\frac{qN_{D}}{\\varepsilon_{s}}\\left[Wx' - \\frac{x'^2}{2}\\right]_{0}^{x} = -\\frac{qN_{D}}{\\varepsilon_{s}}\\left(Wx - \\frac{x^2}{2}\\right) $$\nThe total potential drop across the junction is the sum of the built-in potential $V_{bi}$ and the magnitude of the applied reverse bias voltage $V$. Since the junction is one-sided, this potential drop occurs almost entirely across the $n$-side of the depletion region.\n$$ V_{bi} + V = \\psi(0) - \\psi(W) = 0 - \\left(-\\frac{qN_{D}}{\\varepsilon_{s}}\\left(W^2 - \\frac{W^2}{2}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{qN_{D}W^2}{2\\varepsilon_{s}} $$\nFrom this, we can express the depletion width $W$ as a function of the total voltage:\n$$ W(V) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\varepsilon_{s}(V_{bi}+V)}{qN_{D}}} $$\nThe total magnitude of the uncompensated charge in the SCR is $Q_{j} = A q N_{D} W$, where $A$ is the junction area. The junction depletion capacitance $C_{j}$ is defined as the change in this charge with respect to the applied voltage $V$:\n$$ C_{j}(V) = \\left|\\frac{dQ_{j}}{dV_{app}}\\right| = \\frac{dQ_{j}}{dV} = \\frac{d}{dV} \\left( A q N_{D} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\varepsilon_{s}(V_{bi}+V)}{qN_{D}}} \\right) $$\n$$ C_{j}(V) = A \\sqrt{qN_{D}} \\sqrt{2\\varepsilon_{s}} \\frac{d}{dV}\\left( (V_{bi}+V)^{1/2} \\right) = A \\sqrt{2qN_{D}\\varepsilon_{s}} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}(V_{bi}+V)^{-1/2} \\right) $$\n$$ C_{j}(V) = A \\sqrt{\\frac{q\\varepsilon_{s}N_{D}}{2(V_{bi}+V)}} $$\nThis is the desired expression for the depletion capacitance.\n\n\\textbf{2. Extraction of Donor Concentration $N_{D}$}\n\nTo extract $N_{D}$ from experimental data, it is convenient to rearrange the capacitance equation into a linear form. Squaring and inverting the expression for $C_{j}$ gives:\n$$ \\frac{1}{C_{j}^2} = \\frac{2(V_{bi}+V)}{A^2 q \\varepsilon_{s} N_{D}} = \\left(\\frac{2}{A^2 q \\varepsilon_{s} N_{D}}\\right)V + \\frac{2V_{bi}}{A^2 q \\varepsilon_{s} N_{D}} $$\nThis equation shows that a plot of $1/C_{j}^2$ versus $V$ yields a straight line. The slope of this line is given by:\n$$ m = \\frac{d(1/C_{j}^2)}{dV} = \\frac{2}{A^2 q \\varepsilon_{s} N_{D}} $$\nBy measuring the capacitance at two different reverse biases, we can calculate this slope and then solve for $N_{D}$:\n$$ N_{D} = \\frac{2}{m A^2 q \\varepsilon_{s}} $$\n\n\\textbf{3. Measurement Considerations and Frequency Justification}\n\nThe small-signal admittance is measured in parallel form, $\\tilde{Y} = G + jB$, where $G$ is the conductance and $B$ is the susceptance. For a simple parallel RC circuit, the admittance is $Y = 1/R_p + j\\omega C_p$. We assume the measured susceptance is dominated by the junction capacitance, such that $B = \\omega C_{j}$, where $\\omega = 2\\pi f$ is the angular frequency. This yields $C_{j} = B/\\omega$.\n\nThe choice of measurement frequency $f = 1.00 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ is appropriate for several reasons:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item It is high enough that the capacitive susceptance $B=\\omega C_j$ is much larger than the parallel conductance $G$, which arises from leakage currents and generation-recombination processes in the SCR. A high $Q$-factor ($Q = B/G$) indicates a high-fidelity capacitance measurement. For the data at $V_{1}=20\\,\\mathrm{V}$, $Q_1 = B_1/G_1 = (7.258 \\times 10^{-4})/(2.0 \\times 10^{-6}) \\approx 363$, which is very high.\n    \\item It is low enough to prevent deep-level traps within the semiconductor bandgap from responding to the AC signal. Such traps have characteristic charge emission/capture times that are typically in the millisecond range or longer. Measuring at $f=100\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$ (period $T=10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$) ensures that only the shallow dopants contribute to the capacitance, giving an accurate value for $N_{D}$.\n    \\item The frequency is also well below the dielectric relaxation frequency of the neutral $n$-region, ensuring that this region acts as a conductor and the AC voltage drop occurs primarily across the depletion layer, not in the series resistance of the quasi-neutral region.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\textbf{4. Calculation of $N_{D}$}\n\nThe measured data are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item At $V_{1} = 20\\,\\mathrm{V}$, $B_{1} = 7.258\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{S}$.\n    \\item At $V_{2} = 60\\,\\mathrm{V}$, $B_{2} = 4.246\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{S}$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe angular frequency is $\\omega = 2\\pi f = 2 \\pi (1.00 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})$. The capacitances are:\n$$ C_{j1} = \\frac{B_{1}}{\\omega} = \\frac{7.258\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{S}}{2\\pi \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}} $$\n$$ C_{j2} = \\frac{B_{2}}{\\omega} = \\frac{4.246\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{S}}{2\\pi \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}} $$\nWe calculate the slope $m$ using the two data points:\n$$ m = \\frac{(1/C_{j2}^2) - (1/C_{j1}^2)}{V_2 - V_1} = \\frac{\\omega^2/B_{2}^2 - \\omega^2/B_{1}^2}{V_2 - V_1} = \\frac{\\omega^2(B_2^{-2} - B_1^{-2})}{V_2 - V_1} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ B_1^{-2} = (7.258\\times 10^{-4})^{-2} \\approx 1.8982 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{S}^{-2} $$\n$$ B_2^{-2} = (4.246\\times 10^{-4})^{-2} \\approx 5.5493 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{S}^{-2} $$\n$$ m = \\frac{(2\\pi \\times 1.00 \\times 10^5)^2 (5.5493 \\times 10^6 - 1.8982 \\times 10^6)}{60 - 20} \\approx \\frac{(3.9478 \\times 10^{11}) (3.6511 \\times 10^6)}{40} $$\n$$ m \\approx 3.6027 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{F}^{-2}\\mathrm{V}^{-1} $$\nNow we solve for $N_{D}$ using the constants:\n$A = 5.00 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}$\n$q = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n$\\varepsilon_{s} = 11.7 \\times \\varepsilon_{0} = 11.7 \\times (8.854187817 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}) \\approx 1.0359 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}$\n$$ N_{D} = \\frac{2}{m A^2 q \\varepsilon_{s}} $$\n$$ N_{D} = \\frac{2}{(3.6027 \\times 10^{16})(5.00 \\times 10^{-5})^2 (1.60217... \\times 10^{-19})(1.0359 \\times 10^{-10})} $$\n$$ N_{D} \\approx \\frac{2}{(3.6027 \\times 10^{16})(2.5 \\times 10^{-9})(1.6617 \\times 10^{-29})} \\approx \\frac{2}{1.4962 \\times 10^{-21}} $$\n$$ N_{D} \\approx 1.3367 \\times 10^{21}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3} $$\nThe problem requests the answer in units of $\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.

The constraints are sufficient to lead to a unique solution within the framework of the specified model.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, technical language, free from any subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is assessed as **valid**. It is a scientifically sound and well-posed problem in semiconductor device physics. The solution process may now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe forward voltage drop, $V_{F}$, across the intrinsic drift region of thickness $t_{d}$ is the integral of the electric field, $E(x)$, over the length of the region:\n$$V_{F} = \\int_{0}^{t_d} E(x) dx$$\nThe problem states that transport is dominated by drift. The total current density, $J$, is the sum of the electron and hole drift current densities:\n$$J = J_{n} + J_{p} = q n(x) \\mu_{n} E(x) + q p(x) \\mu_{p} E(x)$$\nThis can be written as $J = \\sigma(x) E(x)$, where $\\sigma(x) = q(n(x)\\mu_{n} + p(x)\\mu_{p})$ is the local conductivity.\n\nThe diode is in high-level injection, which means the excess carrier concentrations, $\\delta n$ and $\\delta p$, are much greater than the background doping concentration in the lightly doped intrinsic region. Thus, we can approximate the total carrier concentrations as $n(x) \\approx \\delta n(x)$ and $p(x) \\approx \\delta p(x)$. The problem further assumes charge neutrality and spatial uniformity, so $\\delta n(x) = \\delta p(x) = \\delta n_{\\text{avg}}$, where $\\delta n_{\\text{avg}}$ is a constant.\n\nUnder these conditions, the conductivity $\\sigma$ becomes uniform throughout the drift region:\n$$\\sigma = q(\\delta n_{\\text{avg}} \\mu_{n} + \\delta n_{\\text{avg}} \\mu_{p}) = q \\delta n_{\\text{avg}} (\\mu_{n} + \\mu_{p})$$\nUsing the given definition $\\mu \\equiv \\mu_{n} + \\mu_{p}$, the conductivity is:\n$$\\sigma = q \\delta n_{\\text{avg}} \\mu$$\nSince $J$ and $\\sigma$ are constants, the electric field $E = J/\\sigma$ must also be constant throughout the drift region. The voltage drop integral simplifies to:\n$$V_{F} = E \\cdot t_{d}$$\nTo find $E$, we must first determine the average excess carrier concentration $\\delta n_{\\text{avg}}$. This is accomplished using the steady-state continuity of carrier charge. In steady state, the total current flowing through the device must supply the carriers that are lost to recombination within the drift region. The recombination rate per unit volume is given by the SRH model as $R(x) = \\frac{\\delta n(x)}{\\tau}$.\n\nThe total recombination current density is the integral of the charge recombining per unit time per unit volume over the drift region thickness:\n$$J_{\\text{recomb}} = \\int_{0}^{t_d} q R(x) dx = \\int_{0}^{t_d} q \\frac{\\delta n(x)}{\\tau} dx$$\nIn steady state, $J = J_{\\text{recomb}}$. With the assumption of uniform carrier density $\\delta n(x) = \\delta n_{\\text{avg}}$ and constant lifetime $\\tau$, the integral becomes:\n$$J = q \\frac{\\delta n_{\\text{avg}}}{\\tau} \\int_{0}^{t_d} dx = q \\frac{\\delta n_{\\text{avg}}}{\\tau} t_{d}$$\nFrom this continuity relation, we can solve for the average excess carrier concentration:\n$$\\delta n_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{J \\tau}{q t_{d}}$$\nNow we substitute this expression for $\\delta n_{\\text{avg}}$ back into the equation for conductivity:\n$$\\sigma = q \\left( \\frac{J \\tau}{q t_{d}} \\right) \\mu = \\frac{J \\tau \\mu}{t_{d}}$$\nThe electric field $E$ can now be found:\n$$E = \\frac{J}{\\sigma} = \\frac{J}{\\frac{J \\tau \\mu}{t_{d}}} = \\frac{t_{d}}{\\mu \\tau}$$\nThis result shows that within this model, the electric field in the drift region is independent of the current density $J$. This is a direct consequence of conductivity modulation, where the conductivity $\\sigma$ increases proportionally to $J$.\n\nFinally, we derive the expression for the forward voltage drop $V_{F}$:\n$$V_{F} = E \\cdot t_{d} = \\left( \\frac{t_{d}}{\\mu \\tau} \\right) t_{d}$$\n$$V_{F} = \\frac{t_{d}^{2}}{\\mu \\tau}$$\nThis is the required analytical expression. Although the derivation involved $J$, the final expression for $V_{F}$ is independent of $J$ under the given simplifying assumptions.\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\nWe are given the following numerical values:\n-   $\\mu_{n} = 800~\\mathrm{cm^{2}/(V\\cdot s)}$\n-   $\\mu_{p} = 300~\\mathrm{cm^{2}/(V\\cdot s)}$\n-   $\\tau = 3~\\mu\\mathrm{s} = 3 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{s}$\n-   $t_{d} = 150~\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 150 \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{cm} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-2}~\\mathrm{cm}$\n\nFirst, calculate the effective ambipolar mobility $\\mu$:\n$$\\mu = \\mu_{n} + \\mu_{p} = 800~\\mathrm{cm^{2}/(V\\cdot s)} + 300~\\mathrm{cm^{2}/(V\\cdot s)} = 1100~\\mathrm{cm^{2}/(V\\cdot s)}$$\nNow, substitute the values into the expression for $V_{F}$:\n$$V_{F} = \\frac{(1.5 \\times 10^{-2}~\\mathrm{cm})^{2}}{(1100~\\mathrm{cm^{2}/(V\\cdot s)}) (3 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{s})}$$\n$$V_{F} = \\frac{2.25 \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{cm^{2}}}{3300 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{cm^{2}/V}} = \\frac{2.25 \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{cm^{2}}}{3.3 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{cm^{2}/V}}$$\n$$V_{F} = \\frac{2.25}{3.3} \\times 10^{-1}~\\mathrm{V} \\approx 0.681818... \\times 10^{-1}~\\mathrm{V}$$\n$$V_{F} \\approx 0.0681818...~\\mathrm{V}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $0.06818~\\mathrm{V}$.",

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe analysis is based on the charge-control principle, which is a direct consequence of carrier continuity. The rate of change of the total excess mobile charge, $Q(t)$, stored in the intrinsic region is equal to the net current flowing into the region, $I(t)$, minus the charge lost per unit time due to recombination, $I_{\\text{recomb}}(t)$. The governing equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dQ(t)}{dt} = I(t) - I_{\\text{recomb}}(t)\n$$\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the stored charge $Q(t)$ and the recombination current $I_{\\text{recomb}}(t)$. The problem states that recombination is a volumetric sink. The volumetric recombination rate, $R$, is the excess carrier density divided by the effective carrier lifetime, $R = \\frac{\\Delta n}{\\tau}$. Given the assumption of a spatially uniform carrier distribution, $\\Delta n$ is constant throughout the intrinsic region's volume, $V = A W$.\nThe total number of carriers recombining per second is $\\int_V R \\,dV = R \\cdot V = \\frac{\\Delta n}{\\tau} A W$.\nThe recombination current is the total charge recombining per second:\n$$\nI_{\\text{recomb}} = q \\left( \\frac{\\Delta n}{\\tau} A W \\right)\n$$\nwhere $q$ is the elementary charge.\nThe total stored excess mobile charge $Q$ is the charge of the excess electrons plus the charge of the excess holes. Under high-level injection, $\\Delta n = \\Delta p$, so the total excess mobile charge density is $q(\\Delta n + \\Delta p) = 2q\\Delta n$. However, the quantity of interest for the charge-control model is the total excess charge of one carrier type, which governs the recombination and current, conventionally taken as $Q = q \\int_V \\Delta p \\,dV$ or $Q = q \\int_V \\Delta n \\,dV$. With a uniform distribution, this becomes:\n$$\nQ = q \\Delta n A W\n$$\nComparing the expressions for $I_{\\text{recomb}}$ and $Q$, we find the fundamental relationship of the charge-control model:\n$$\nI_{\\text{recomb}} = \\frac{Q}{\\tau}\n$$\n\n**Part 1: Steady-State Stored Charge, $Q_s$**\nIn steady forward-bias, the diode conducts a constant current $I_F$, so $I(t) = I_F$. The system is in equilibrium, meaning the stored charge is constant, $Q_s$. Consequently, its time derivative is zero, $\\frac{dQ_s}{dt} = 0$. The charge-control equation becomes:\n$$\n0 = I_F - I_{\\text{recomb}} = I_F - \\frac{Q_s}{\\tau}\n$$\nThis equation signifies that the forward current $I_F$ supplies exactly the charge that is lost to recombination. Solving for the steady-state stored charge $Q_s$:\n$$\nQ_s = I_F \\tau\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Charge-Control Differential Equation and Solution for Turn-Off**\nAt time $t=0$, the current is abruptly switched to a constant reverse current, $I(t) = -I_R$ for $t \\geq 0$. The general charge-control equation, $\\frac{dQ(t)}{dt} = I(t) - \\frac{Q(t)}{\\tau}$, becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dQ(t)}{dt} = -I_R - \\frac{Q(t)}{\\tau}\n$$\nThis is the charge-control differential equation governing the time evolution of the excess mobile charge $Q(t)$ during reverse recovery. We can rewrite it in the standard form for a first-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dQ(t)}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau} Q(t) = -I_R\n$$\nThe initial condition for this process is the charge stored just before the switching event, at $t=0$. This is the steady-state charge $Q_s$ we previously found:\n$$\nQ(0) = Q_s = I_F \\tau\n$$\nThe general solution to an equation of the form $y'(t) + a y(t) = b$ is $y(t) = \\frac{b}{a} + C \\exp(-at)$, where $C$ is a constant of integration. For our equation, $a = \\frac{1}{\\tau}$ and $b = -I_R$. Thus, the solution is:\n$$\nQ(t) = \\frac{-I_R}{1/\\tau} + C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) = -I_R \\tau + C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)\n$$\nWe determine the constant $C$ using the initial condition $Q(0) = I_F \\tau$:\n$$\nQ(0) = I_F \\tau = -I_R \\tau + C \\exp(0) = -I_R \\tau + C\n$$\nSolving for $C$:\n$$\nC = I_F \\tau + I_R \\tau = (I_F + I_R)\\tau\n$$\nSubstituting $C$ back into the solution for $Q(t)$, we obtain the time evolution of the stored charge:\n$$\nQ(t) = -I_R \\tau + (I_F + I_R)\\tau \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Turn-Off Time, $t_{\\text{off}}$**\nThe turn-off time, $t_{\\text{off}}$, is defined as the time at which the excess mobile charge in the drift region decays to zero, i.e., $Q(t_{\\text{off}}) = 0$. We set the expression for $Q(t)$ to zero and solve for $t = t_{\\text{off}}$:\n$$\n0 = -I_R \\tau + (I_F + I_R)\\tau \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\text{off}}}{\\tau}\\right)\n$$\nAssuming $\\tau \\neq 0$, we can divide by $\\tau$:\n$$\nI_R = (I_F + I_R) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\text{off}}}{\\tau}\\right)\n$$\nTo solve for $t_{\\text{off}}$, we first isolate the exponential term:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\text{off}}}{\\tau}\\right) = \\frac{I_R}{I_F + I_R}\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left[\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\text{off}}}{\\tau}\\right)\\right] = \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_R}{I_F + I_R}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{t_{\\text{off}}}{\\tau} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_R}{I_F + I_R}\\right)\n$$\nFinally, we solve for $t_{\\text{off}}$:\n$$\nt_{\\text{off}} = -\\tau \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_R}{I_F + I_R}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the logarithmic identity $-\\ln(x) = \\ln(1/x)$, we can write the expression in a more conventional form:\n$$\nt_{\\text{off}} = \\tau \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_F + I_R}{I_R}\\right) = \\tau \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{I_F}{I_R}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe two derived quantities are the steady-state stored charge $Q_s = I_F \\tau$ and the turn-off time $t_{\\text{off}} = \\tau \\ln(1 + \\frac{I_F}{I_R})$.",
