            "problem": "An Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) is driven by a gate driver that provides a voltage step from a low level $V_{\\text{off}}$ to a high level $V_{\\text{on}}$ through a selectable external gate resistor during turn-on, and from $V_{\\text{on}}$ to $V_{\\text{off}}$ through a separate external gate resistor during turn-off. Assume that, prior to the onset of the Miller plateau, the effective gate-emitter capacitance is a constant $C_{\\text{ge}}$, the device exhibits a transconductance $g_{m}$ in its conduction region such that the collector current $I_{C}$ is approximately linear in the gate-emitter voltage $V_{GE}$ as $I_{C} \\approx g_{m}\\left(V_{GE}-V_{\\text{th}}\\right)$ for $V_{GE} \\geq V_{\\text{th}}$, and the gate network can be modeled as a first-order resistive-capacitive charging or discharging process with negligible parasitic inductance. The driver output resistance is negligible compared to the external gate resistors, and the internal gate resistance of the IGBT is neglected.\n\nYou are required to select the external gate resistors for turn-on and turn-off, denoted $R_{g,\\text{on}}$ and $R_{g,\\text{off}}$, so that the collector current slew rate at the instant the gate-emitter voltage crosses the threshold $V_{\\text{th}}$ equals specified targets in magnitude for turn-on and turn-off. The physical parameters are:\n- High-level gate drive voltage $V_{\\text{on}} = 15$ V,\n- Low-level gate drive voltage $V_{\\text{off}} = -5$ V,\n- Threshold gate-emitter voltage $V_{\\text{th}} = 5$ V,\n- Effective pre-Miller gate-emitter capacitance $C_{\\text{ge}} = 5$ nF,\n- Transconductance $g_{m} = 10$ S.\n\nThe required collector current slew rates at the threshold crossing are:\n- Turn-on target $\\left.\\frac{dI_{C}}{dt}\\right|_{\\text{th, on}} = +2.2 \\times 10^{9}$ A/s,\n- Turn-off target $\\left.\\frac{dI_{C}}{dt}\\right|_{\\text{th, off}} = -1.3 \\times 10^{9}$ A/s.\n\nIn addition, verify that the selected resistors do not demand gate driver currents exceeding the driver capability when the voltage steps are applied. The driver’s maximum source and sink currents are:\n- Maximum source current $I_{\\text{src},\\max} = 2.3$ A,\n- Maximum sink current $I_{\\text{sink},\\max} = 1.4$ A.\n\nUse first-principles relationships among resistor current, capacitor current, and transconductance to derive the expressions needed to compute $R_{g,\\text{on}}$ and $R_{g,\\text{off}}$. Then compute their numerical values and check the driver current constraints by evaluating the initial gate current magnitude at the instant of the voltage step for each transition. Round your resistor values to four significant figures and express them in ohms. The final answer must be the pair $(R_{g,\\text{on}}, R_{g,\\text{off}})$.",
            "solution": "The core of the problem lies in relating the collector current slew rate, $\\frac{dI_{C}}{dt}$, to the parameters of the external gate drive circuit. The relationship is established through the device's transconductance, $g_{m}$, and its gate-emitter capacitance, $C_{\\text{ge}}$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the relationship between the collector current $I_{C}$ and the gate-emitter voltage $V_{GE}$. In the active region, for $V_{GE} \\ge V_{\\text{th}}$, the problem provides the linear approximation:\n$$I_{C} = g_{m}\\left(V_{GE}-V_{\\text{th}}\\right)$$\nwhere $g_{m}$ is the transconductance and $V_{\\text{th}}$ is the threshold voltage.\n\nTo find the collector current slew rate, we differentiate this expression with respect to time $t$. Since $g_{m}$ and $V_{\\text{th}}$ are constants:\n$$\\frac{dI_{C}}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left[g_{m}\\left(V_{GE}-V_{\\text{th}}\\right)\\right] = g_{m}\\frac{dV_{GE}}{dt}$$\nThis equation establishes a direct proportionality between the collector current slew rate and the rate of change of the gate-emitter voltage.\n\nNext, we analyze the gate circuit. The problem states that the gate circuit can be modeled as a first-order resistive-capacitive (RC) network. The current flowing into the gate, $I_{G}$, charges the effective gate-emitter capacitance $C_{\\text{ge}}$. The fundamental capacitor current-voltage relationship is:\n$$I_{G} = C_{\\text{ge}}\\frac{dV_{GE}}{dt}$$\nWe can rearrange this to express $\\frac{dV_{GE}}{dt}$ in terms of the gate current:\n$$\\frac{dV_{GE}}{dt} = \\frac{I_{G}}{C_{\\text{ge}}}$$\nSubstituting this into our expression for the collector current slew rate, we find a direct link between $\\frac{dI_{C}}{dt}$ and $I_{G}$:\n$$\\frac{dI_{C}}{dt} = g_{m}\\left(\\frac{I_{G}}{C_{\\text{ge}}}\\right)$$\nThis central relationship allows us to determine the required gate current $I_{G}$ at the moment of threshold crossing to achieve a target slew rate.\n\nThe gate current $I_{G}$ is driven by the potential difference across the external gate resistor $R_{g}$ (either $R_{g,\\text{on}}$ or $R_{g,\\text{off}}$). Applying Ohm's law to the gate loop:\n$$I_{G} = \\frac{V_{\\text{drive}} - V_{GE}}{R_{g}}$$\nwhere $V_{\\text{drive}}$ is the instantaneous output voltage of the gate driver.\n\nWe are interested in the specific instant when the gate-emitter voltage crosses the threshold, i.e., when $V_{GE} = V_{\\text{th}}$. At this moment, we can combine our equations to solve for the required gate resistors.\n\n**1. Calculation of the Turn-On Gate Resistor, $R_{g,\\text{on}}$**\n\nDuring turn-on, the driver voltage is $V_{\\text{drive}} = V_{\\text{on}}$. At the threshold crossing, $V_{GE} = V_{\\text{th}}$. The gate current is:\n$$I_{G,\\text{th, on}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{on}} - V_{\\text{th}}}{R_{g,\\text{on}}}$$\nThe collector current slew rate at this instant is the specified target, $\\left.\\frac{dI_{C}}{dt}\\right|_{\\text{th, on}}$. We use our central relationship:\n$$\\left.\\frac{dI_{C}}{dt}\\right|_{\\text{th, on}} = g_{m}\\frac{I_{G,\\text{th, on}}}{C_{\\text{ge}}} = \\frac{g_{m}}{C_{\\text{ge}}}\\left(\\frac{V_{\\text{on}} - V_{\\text{th}}}{R_{g,\\text{on}}}\\right)$$\nSolving for $R_{g,\\text{on}}$:\n$$R_{g,\\text{on}} = \\frac{g_{m}\\left(V_{\\text{on}} - V_{\\text{th}}\\right)}{C_{\\text{ge}}\\left.\\frac{dI_{C}}{dt}\\right|_{\\text{th, on}}}$$\nSubstituting the given values: $g_{m} = 10$ S, $V_{\\text{on}} = 15$ V, $V_{\\text{th}} = 5$ V, $C_{\\text{ge}} = 5 \\times 10^{-9}$ F, and $\\left.\\frac{dI_{C}}{dt}\\right|_{\\text{th, on}} = 2.2 \\times 10^{9}$ A/s.\n$$R_{g,\\text{on}} = \\frac{10 \\cdot (15 - 5)}{(5 \\times 10^{-9}) \\cdot (2.2 \\times 10^{9})} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 10}{5 \\cdot 2.2} = \\frac{100}{11} \\approx 9.0909... \\, \\Omega$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $R_{g,\\text{on}} = 9.091 \\, \\Omega$.\n\n**2. Calculation of the Turn-Off Gate Resistor, $R_{g,\\text{off}}$**\n\nDuring turn-off, the driver voltage is $V_{\\text{drive}} = V_{\\text{off}}$. At the threshold crossing, $V_{GE} = V_{\\text{th}}$. The gate current is:\n$$I_{G,\\text{th, off}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{off}} - V_{\\text{th}}}{R_{g,\\text{off}}}$$\nThe collector current slew rate at this instant is $\\left.\\frac{dI_{C}}{dt}\\right|_{\\text{th, off}}$. Using the central relationship again:\n$$\\left.\\frac{dI_{C}}{dt}\\right|_{\\text{th, off}} = g_{m}\\frac{I_{G,\\text{th, off}}}{C_{\\text{ge}}} = \\frac{g_{m}}{C_{\\text{ge}}}\\left(\\frac{V_{\\text{off}} - V_{\\text{th}}}{R_{g,\\text{off}}}\\right)$$\nSolving for $R_{g,\\text{off}}$:\n$$R_{g,\\text{off}} = \\frac{g_{m}\\left(V_{\\text{off}} - V_{\\text{th}}\\right)}{C_{\\text{ge}}\\left.\\frac{dI_{C}}{dt}\\right|_{\\text{th, off}}}$$\nSubstituting the given values: $g_{m} = 10$ S, $V_{\\text{off}} = -5$ V, $V_{\\text{th}} = 5$ V, $C_{\\text{ge}} = 5 \\times 10^{-9}$ F, and $\\left.\\frac{dI_{C}}{dt}\\right|_{\\text{th, off}} = -1.3 \\times 10^{9}$ A/s.\n$$R_{g,\\text{off}} = \\frac{10 \\cdot (-5 - 5)}{(5 \\times 10^{-9}) \\cdot (-1.3 \\times 10^{9})} = \\frac{10 \\cdot (-10)}{5 \\cdot (-1.3)} = \\frac{-100}{-6.5} = \\frac{200}{13} \\approx 15.3846... \\, \\Omega$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $R_{g,\\text{off}} = 15.38 \\, \\Omega$.\n\n**3. Verification of Gate Driver Current Limits**\n\nWe must verify that the peak gate currents do not exceed the driver's maximum source and sink capabilities. The peak current occurs at the very beginning of the switching transition, when the voltage across the gate resistor is maximal.\n\nFor turn-on, the transition is from $V_{\\text{off}}$ to $V_{\\text{on}}$. At the instant the driver switches, the gate-emitter voltage is still at its initial value, $V_{GE}(0^{+}) = V_{\\text{off}} = -5$ V. The peak source current is:\n$$I_{G,\\text{on,peak}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{on}} - V_{GE}(0^{+})}{R_{g,\\text{on}}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{on}} - V_{\\text{off}}}{R_{g,\\text{on}}} = \\frac{15 - (-5)}{9.091} \\approx 2.19997... \\, \\text{A}$$\nUsing the exact value for calculation: $I_{G,\\text{on,peak}} = \\frac{20}{100/11} = 2.2$ A. This current is sourced by the driver. We check against the maximum source current limit, $I_{\\text{src,max}} = 2.3$ A. Since $2.2 \\, \\text{A}  2.3 \\, \\text{A}$, the turn-on driver current constraint is satisfied.\n\nFor turn-off, the transition is from $V_{\\text{on}}$ to $V_{\\text{off}}$. Assuming the IGBT was fully on, the initial gate-emitter voltage is $V_{GE}(0^{+}) = V_{\\text{on}} = 15$ V. The peak sink current is:\n$$I_{G,\\text{off,peak}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{off}} - V_{GE}(0^{+})}{R_{g,\\text{off}}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{off}} - V_{\\text{on}}}{R_{g,\\text{off}}} = \\frac{-5 - 15}{15.38} \\approx -1.300... \\, \\text{A}$$\nUsing the exact value for calculation: $I_{G,\\text{off,peak}} = \\frac{-20}{200/13} = -1.3$ A. The magnitude of this current, $|-1.3 \\, \\text{A}| = 1.3$ A, is sunk by the driver. We check against the maximum sink current limit, $I_{\\text{sink,max}} = 1.4$ A. Since $1.3 \\, \\text{A}  1.4 \\, \\text{A}$, the turn-off driver current constraint is also satisfied.\n\nBoth calculated resistor values meet the specified slew rate requirements and respect the driver current limitations.\nThe final required values are $R_{g,\\text{on}} = 9.091 \\, \\Omega$ and $R_{g,\\text{off}} = 15.38 \\, \\Omega$.",
