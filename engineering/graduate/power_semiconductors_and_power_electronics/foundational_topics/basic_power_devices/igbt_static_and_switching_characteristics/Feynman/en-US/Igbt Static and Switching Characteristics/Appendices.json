            "problem": "An Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) is driven by a gate driver that provides a voltage step from a low level $V_{\\text{off}}$ to a high level $V_{\\text{on}}$ through a selectable external gate resistor during turn-on, and from $V_{\\text{on}}$ to $V_{\\text{off}}$ through a separate external gate resistor during turn-off. Assume that, prior to the onset of the Miller plateau, the effective gate-emitter capacitance is a constant $C_{\\text{ge}}$, the device exhibits a transconductance $g_{m}$ in its conduction region such that the collector current $I_{C}$ is approximately linear in the gate-emitter voltage $V_{GE}$ as $I_{C} \\approx g_{m}\\left(V_{GE}-V_{\\text{th}}\\right)$ for $V_{GE} \\geq V_{\\text{th}}$, and the gate network can be modeled as a first-order resistive-capacitive charging or discharging process with negligible parasitic inductance. The driver output resistance is negligible compared to the external gate resistors, and the internal gate resistance of the IGBT is neglected.\n\nYou are required to select the external gate resistors for turn-on and turn-off, denoted $R_{g,\\text{on}}$ and $R_{g,\\text{off}}$, so that the collector current slew rate at the instant the gate-emitter voltage crosses the threshold $V_{\\text{th}}$ equals specified targets in magnitude for turn-on and turn-off.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a complete and consistent set of parameters to determine the required gate resistors for an Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) based on a standard, simplified model of its switching characteristics. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in relating the collector current slew rate, $\\frac{dI_{C}}{dt}$, to the parameters of the external gate drive circuit. The relationship is established through the device's transconductance, $g_{m}$, and its gate-emitter capacitance, $C_{\\text{ge}}$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the relationship between the collector current $I_{C}$ and the gate-emitter voltage $V_{GE}$. In the active region, for $V_{GE} \\ge V_{\\text{th}}$, the problem provides the linear approximation:\n$$I_{C} = g_{m}\\left(V_{GE}-V_{\\text{th}}\\right)$$\nwhere $g_{m}$ is the transconductance and $V_{\\text{th}}$ is the threshold voltage.\n\nTo find the collector current slew rate, we differentiate this expression with respect to time $t$. Since $g_{m}$ and $V_{\\text{th}}$ are constants:\n$$\\frac{dI_{C}}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left[g_{m}\\left(V_{GE}-V_{\\text{th}}\\right)\\right] = g_{m}\\frac{dV_{GE}}{dt}$$\nThis equation establishes a direct proportionality between the collector current slew rate and the rate of change of the gate-emitter voltage.\n\nNext, we analyze the gate circuit. The problem states that the gate circuit can be modeled as a first-order resistive-capacitive (RC) network. The current flowing into the gate, $I_{G}$, charges the effective gate-emitter capacitance $C_{\\text{ge}}$. The fundamental capacitor current-voltage relationship is:\n$$I_{G} = C_{\\text{ge}}\\frac{dV_{GE}}{dt}$$\nWe can rearrange this to express $\\frac{dV_{GE}}{dt}$ in terms of the gate current:\n$$\\frac{dV_{GE}}{dt} = \\frac{I_{G}}{C_{\\text{ge}}}$$\nSubstituting this into our expression for the collector current slew rate, we find a direct link between $\\frac{dI_{C}}{dt}$ and $I_{G}$:\n$$\\frac{dI_{C}}{dt} = g_{m}\\left(\\frac{I_{G}}{C_{\\text{ge}}}\\right)$$\nThis central relationship allows us to determine the required gate current $I_{G}$ at the moment of threshold crossing to achieve a target slew rate.\n\nThe gate current $I_{G}$ is driven by the potential difference across the external gate resistor $R_{g}$ (either $R_{g,\\text{on}}$ or $R_{g,\\text{off}}$). Applying Ohm's law to the gate loop:\n$$I_{G} = \\frac{V_{\\text{drive}} - V_{GE}}{R_{g}}$$\nwhere $V_{\\text{drive}}$ is the instantaneous output voltage of the gate driver.\n\nWe are interested in the specific instant when the gate-emitter voltage crosses the threshold, i.e., when $V_{GE} = V_{\\text{th}}$. At this moment, we can combine our equations to solve for the required gate resistors.\n\n**1. Calculation of the Turn-On Gate Resistor, $R_{g,\\text{on}}$**\n\nDuring turn-on, the driver voltage is $V_{\\text{drive}} = V_{\\text{on}}$. At the threshold crossing, $V_{GE} = V_{\\text{th}}$. The gate current is:\n$$I_{G,\\text{th, on}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{on}} - V_{\\text{th}}}{R_{g,\\text{on}}}$$\nThe collector current slew rate at this instant is the specified target, $\\left.\\frac{dI_{C}}{dt}\\right|_{\\text{th, on}}$. We use our central relationship:\n$$\\left.\\frac{dI_{C}}{dt}\\right|_{\\text{th, on}} = g_{m}\\frac{I_{G,\\text{th, on}}}{C_{\\text{ge}}} = \\frac{g_{m}}{C_{\\text{ge}}}\\left(\\frac{V_{\\text{on}} - V_{\\text{th}}}{R_{g,\\text{on}}}\\right)$$\nSolving for $R_{g,\\text{on}}$:\n$$R_{g,\\text{on}} = \\frac{g_{m}\\left(V_{\\text{on}} - V_{\\text{th}}\\right)}{C_{\\text{ge}}\\left.\\frac{dI_{C}}{dt}\\right|_{\\text{th, on}}}$$\nSubstituting the given values: $g_{m} = 10$ S, $V_{\\text{on}} = 15$ V, $V_{\\text{th}} = 5$ V, $C_{\\text{ge}} = 5 \\times 10^{-9}$ F, and $\\left.\\frac{dI_{C}}{dt}\\right|_{\\text{th, on}} = 2.2 \\times 10^{9}$ A/s.\n$$R_{g,\\text{on}} = \\frac{10 \\cdot (15 - 5)}{(5 \\times 10^{-9}) \\cdot (2.2 \\times 10^{9})} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 10}{5 \\cdot 2.2} = \\frac{100}{11} \\approx 9.0909... \\, \\Omega$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $R_{g,\\text{on}} = 9.091 \\, \\Omega$.\n\n**2. Calculation of the Turn-Off Gate Resistor, $R_{g,\\text{off}}$**\n\nDuring turn-off, the driver voltage is $V_{\\text{drive}} = V_{\\text{off}}$. At the threshold crossing, $V_{GE} = V_{\\text{th}}$. The gate current is:\n$$I_{G,\\text{th, off}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{off}} - V_{\\text{th}}}{R_{g,\\text{off}}}$$\nThe collector current slew rate at this instant is $\\left.\\frac{dI_{C}}{dt}\\right|_{\\text{th, off}}$.

Verification of Gate Driver Current Limits**\n\nWe must verify that the peak gate currents do not exceed the driver's maximum source and sink capabilities. The peak current occurs at the very beginning of the switching transition, when the voltage across the gate resistor is maximal.\n\nFor turn-on, the transition is from $V_{\\text{off}}$ to $V_{\\text{on}}$. At the instant the driver switches, the gate-emitter voltage is still at its initial value, $V_{GE}(0^{+}) = V_{\\text{off}} = -5$ V. The peak source current is:\n$$I_{G,\\text{on,peak}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{on}} - V_{GE}(0^{+})}{R_{g,\\text{on}}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{on}} - V_{\\text{off}}}{R_{g,\\text{on}}} = \\frac{15 - (-5)}{9.091} = \\frac{20}{9.091} \\approx 2.19997... \\, \\text{A}$$\nUsing the exact value for calculation: $I_{G,\\text{on,peak}} = \\frac{20}{100/11} = 2.2$ A. This current is sourced by the driver. We check against the maximum source current limit, $I_{\\text{src,max}} = 2.3$ A. Since $2.2 \\, \\text{A}  2.3 \\, \\text{A}$, the turn-on driver current constraint is satisfied.\n\nFor turn-off, the transition is from $V_{\\text{on}}$ to $V_{\\text{off}}$. Assuming the IGBT was fully on, the initial gate-emitter voltage is $V_{GE}(0^{+}) = V_{\\text{on}} = 15$ V. The peak sink current is:\n$$I_{G,\\text{off,peak}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{off}} - V_{GE}(0^{+})}{R_{g,\\text{off}}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{off}} - V_{\\text{on}}}{R_{g,\\text{off}}} = \\frac{-5 - 15}{15.38} = \\frac{-20}{15.38} \\approx -1.300... \\, \\text{A}$$\nUsing the exact value for calculation: $I_{G,\\text{off,peak}} = \\frac{-20}{200/13} = -1.3$ A. The magnitude of this current, $|-1.3 \\, \\text{A}| = 1.3$ A, is sunk by the driver. We check against the maximum sink current limit, $I_{\\text{sink,max}} = 1.4$ A. Since $1.3 \\, \\text{A}  1.4 \\, \\text{A}$, the turn-off driver current constraint is also satisfied.\n\nBoth calculated resistor values meet the specified slew rate requirements and respect the driver current limitations.\nThe final required values are $R_{g,\\text{on}} = 9.091 \\, \\Omega$ and $R_{g,\\text{off}} = 15.38 \\, \\Omega$.",

The constitutive relation for the inductor gives this voltage:\n$$\n\\Delta V_{CE}(t) = -L_{\\sigma} \\frac{dI_C(t)}{dt}\n$$\nSince the current is decreasing during turn-off, $\\frac{dI_C}{dt}$ is negative, resulting in a positive voltage overshoot. To find the peak overshoot, we must determine the maximum rate of change of the collector current, $\\max|\\frac{dI_C}{dt}|$. This rate is controlled by the dynamics of the gate circuit.\n\n**1. Gate Circuit Dynamics**\nThe gate circuit during turn-off can be modeled as a capacitor $C_{g,\\text{eff}}$ discharging through a resistor $R_g$ to a voltage source of $0$ V.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the total switching energy per cycle and the average switching power for a hard-switched Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) based on piecewise linear and exponential approximations of its voltage and current waveforms during transitions.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement.\nAll given parameters, variables, and definitions are extracted:\n- DC bus voltage: $V_{\\mathrm{DC}}=600\\,\\text{V}$\n- Load current: $I_{L}=50\\,\\text{A}$\n- Collector-emitter saturation voltage: $V_{\\mathrm{CE,sat}}=2.2\\,\\text{V}$\n- Switching frequency: $f_{s}=2.0\\times 10^{4}\\,\\text{Hz}$\n- Duty cycle: $D=0.35$\n- Turn-on current-rise time: $t_{i}=120\\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{s}$\n- Turn-on voltage-fall time: $t_{v\\downarrow}=180\\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{s}$\n- Turn-off voltage-rise time: $t_{v\\uparrow}=200\\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{s}$\n- Turn-off tail-current time constant: $\\tau=0.25\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{s}$\n- Waveform definitions for turn-on and turn-off stages are provided as explicit functions of time.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of power electronics, providing a standard, simplified model for IGBT switching characteristics. It is well-posed, with all necessary information supplied to compute the required quantities. The language is objective and the parameters are physically realistic for a modern power semiconductor device. The duty cycle $D$ is extraneous to the calculation of switching losses per cycle but does not invalidate the problem. The problem is deemed valid. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe fundamental relationship for energy loss during a switching transition is the time integral of the instantaneous power, $p(t)=v_{\\mathrm{CE}}(t)i_{C}(t)$, over the duration of the transition.
