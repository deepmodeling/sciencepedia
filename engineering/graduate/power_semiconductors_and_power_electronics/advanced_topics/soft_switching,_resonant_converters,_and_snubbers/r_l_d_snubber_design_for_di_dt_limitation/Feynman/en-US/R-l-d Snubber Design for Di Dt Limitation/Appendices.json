            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of a snubber inductance $L_s$ to limit the turn-on current slew rate $(di/dt)$ in an IGBT-based half-bridge, and a subsequent discussion on the effects of a more detailed device model. We begin by analyzing the circuit under the simplified, constant voltage drop assumption.\n\n**Part 1: Snubber Inductance Calculation**\n\nFirst, we establish the governing equation for the circuit during the IGBT turn-on transient. The problem states that the snubber inductor $L_s$ is in the IGBT's current path. During the turn-on of the upper IGBT, it commutates current from the lower freewheeling diode. In this phase, the switch-node voltage is clamped by the freewheeling diode to the negative DC rail (which we can define as $0\\,\\text{V}$). Therefore, the full DC bus voltage, $V_{dc}$, is applied across the series combination of the snubber inductor $L_s$ and the turning-on IGBT.\n\nWe apply Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL) to this loop, starting from the positive DC bus rail:\n$$V_{dc} - v_L - v_{\\text{dev}} = 0$$\nwhere $v_L$ is the voltage across the snubber inductor and $v_{\\text{dev}}$ is the voltage drop across the IGBT.\n\nFrom first principles, the constitutive relation for an inductor is:\n$$v_L = L_s \\frac{di}{dt}$$\nwhere $i(t)$ is the current flowing through the inductor and the IGBT.\n\nSubstituting the inductor's voltage relation into the KVL equation gives:\n$$V_{dc} = L_s \\frac{di}{dt} + v_{\\text{dev}}$$\n\nThe problem initially provides a constant estimate for the device voltage drop, $v_{\\text{dev,est}} = 2.5\\,\\text{V}$. Using this approximation, the equation becomes:\n$$V_{dc} \\approx L_s \\frac{di}{dt} + v_{\\text{dev,est}}$$\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the current slew rate, $di/dt$:\n$$\\frac{di}{dt} \\approx \\frac{V_{dc} - v_{\\text{dev,est}}}{L_s}$$\n\nTo ensure that the current slew rate does not exceed the specified maximum value, $(\\frac{di}{dt})_{\\max}$, we must satisfy the condition:\n$$\\frac{V_{dc} - v_{\\text{dev,est}}}{L_s} \\le \\left(\\frac{di}{dt}\\right)_{\\max}$$\n\nThe minimum required inductance $L_s$ that guarantees this limit is found by setting the equality:\n$$L_s = \\frac{V_{dc} - v_{\\text{dev,est}}}{\\left(\\frac{di}{dt}\\right)_{\\max}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n- DC bus voltage: $V_{dc} = 650\\,\\text{V}$\n- Estimated device voltage drop: $v_{\\text{dev,est}} = 2.5\\,\\text{V}$\n- Maximum allowable current slew rate: $(\\frac{di}{dt})_{\\max} = 4.0\\,\\text{kA}/\\mu\\text{s}$\n\nWe must ensure consistent units for the calculation. The slew rate is converted to Amperes per second:\n$$\\left(\\frac{di}{dt}\\right)_{\\max} = 4.0\\,\\frac{\\text{kA}}{\\mu\\text{s}} = \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{A}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{s}} = 4.0 \\times 10^9\\,\\text{A/s}$$\n\nPlugging the values into the equation for $L_s$:\n$$L_s = \\frac{650\\,\\text{V} - 2.5\\,\\text{V}}{4.0 \\times 10^9\\,\\text{A/s}} = \\frac{647.5}{4.0 \\times 10^9}\\,\\text{H} = 161.875 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{H}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the result in microhenries ($\\mu\\text{H}$). We convert the result:\n$$L_s = 161.875 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{H} = 0.161875 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{H} = 0.161875\\,\\mu\\text{H}$$\n\nRounding to four significant figures as requested:\n$$L_s \\approx 0.1619\\,\\mu\\text{H}$$\n\n**Part 2: Discussion of Current-Dependent Device Drop**\n\nThe problem next introduces a more refined, current-dependent model for the device voltage drop:\n$$v_{\\text{dev}}(i) = v_{0} + r_{\\text{on}}\\,i$$\nwith $v_{0} = 1.8\\,\\text{V}$ and $r_{\\text{on}} = 1.6\\,\\text{m}\\Omega = 1.6 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\Omega$.\n\nWe substitute this more accurate model into the original KVL-derived equation:\n$$V_{dc} = L_s \\frac{di}{dt} + v_{\\text{dev}}(i) = L_s \\frac{di}{dt} + v_{0} + r_{\\text{on}}\\,i$$\n\nTo understand how this changes the instantaneous $di/dt$, we solve for this term:\n$$\\frac{di}{dt} = \\frac{V_{dc} - v_0 - r_{\\text{on}}\\,i}{L_s} = \\frac{V_{dc} - v_0}{L_s} - \\frac{r_{\\text{on}}}{L_s}i$$\n\nThis equation reveals that the current slew rate $di/dt$ is no longer constant during the current rise. It is a function of the instantaneous current $i$.\n- At the very beginning of the turn-on transient, when $t=0$ and thus $i=0$, the slew rate is at its maximum value: $\\left(\\frac{di}{dt}\\right)_{\\text{initial}} = \\frac{V_{dc} - v_0}{L_s}$.\n- As the current $i$ increases, the term $r_{\\text{on}}\\,i$ increases, causing the numerator to decrease. Consequently, the slew rate $di/dt$ decreases as the current ramps up. The current rise is not a perfect linear ramp but rather follows an exponential curve.\n\nFor design purposes, the limit $(\\frac{di}{dt})_{\\max}$ must be respected at all times. Since the slew rate is highest at the beginning of the ramp, the design must be based on this worst-case condition:\n$$\\left(\\frac{di}{dt}\\right)_{\\max} \\ge \\left(\\frac{di}{dt}\\right)_{\\text{initial}} = \\frac{V_{dc} - v_0}{L_s}$$\nA robust design would therefore calculate the required inductance as $L_s = \\frac{V_{dc} - v_0}{(\\frac{di}{dt})_{\\max}}$.\n\nNext, we analyze the sensitivity of the design to errors in the estimated device voltage, $v_{\\text{dev,est}}$. Our initial design used $L_s = \\frac{V_{dc} - v_{\\text{dev,est}}}{(\\frac{di}{dt})_{\\text{target}}}$. If the actual device voltage is $v_{\\text{dev,actual}}$, the resulting slew rate will be $(\\frac{di}{dt})_{\\text{actual}} = \\frac{V_{dc} - v_{\\text{dev,actual}}}{L_s}$. Substituting the expression for $L_s$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{di}{dt}\\right)_{\\text{actual}} = \\frac{V_{dc} - v_{\\text{dev,actual}}}{\\left(\\frac{V_{dc} - v_{\\text{dev,est}}}{(\\frac{di}{dt})_{\\text{target}}}\\right)} = \\left(\\frac{di}{dt}\\right)_{\\text{target}} \\left( \\frac{V_{dc} - v_{\\text{dev,actual}}}{V_{dc} - v_{\\text{dev,est}}} \\right)$$\nLet the error in the voltage estimation be $\\Delta v = v_{\\text{dev,actual}} - v_{\\text{dev,est}}$. The relative error in the resulting slew rate is:\n$$\\frac{(\\frac{di}{dt})_{\\text{actual}} - (\\frac{di}{dt})_{\\text{target}}}{(\\frac{di}{dt})_{\\text{target}}} = \\frac{V_{dc} - v_{\\text{dev,actual}}}{V_{dc} - v_{\\text{dev,est}}} - 1 = \\frac{(V_{dc} - v_{\\text{dev,actual}}) - (V_{dc} - v_{\\text{dev,est}})}{V_{dc} - v_{\\text{dev,est}}} = \\frac{-\\Delta v}{V_{dc} - v_{\\text{dev,est}}}$$\nThe sensitivity of the slew rate to an error in voltage estimation is determined by the factor $\\frac{1}{V_{dc} - v_{\\text{dev,est}}}$. Using the given values:\n$$\\frac{1}{V_{dc} - v_{\\text{dev,est}}} = \\frac{1}{650\\,\\text{V} - 2.5\\,\\text{V}} = \\frac{1}{647.5\\,\\text{V}} \\approx 0.001544\\,\\text{V}^{-1}$$\nThis value is very small, indicating that the design is highly insensitive to errors in $v_{\\text{dev,est}}$. This is because the device voltage drop ($v_{\\text{dev}} \\approx 2.5\\,\\text{V}$) is negligible compared to the DC bus voltage ($V_{dc} = 650\\,\\text{V}$). The inductor voltage $v_L = V_{dc} - v_{\\text{dev}}$ is dominated by $V_{dc}$, so small variations in $v_{\\text{dev}}$ have a correspondingly small impact on $v_L$ and, by extension, on $di/dt$.\n\nFor example, in our case, the constant estimate was $v_{\\text{dev,est}} = 2.5\\,\\text{V}$, while the more accurate model gives an initial voltage of $v_0 = 1.8\\,\\text{V}$. This represents an estimation error of $\\Delta v = 1.8\\,\\text{V} - 2.5\\,\\text{V} = -0.7\\,\\text{V}$. The resulting relative error in $di/dt$ is:\n$$\\text{Relative Error} = \\frac{-(-0.7\\,\\text{V})}{647.5\\,\\text{V}} \\approx 0.00108$$\nThis means the actual initial $di/dt$ will be approximately $0.108\\%$ higher than the target of $4.0\\,\\text{kA}/\\mu\\text{s}$, confirming the low sensitivity. An overestimate of the device voltage drop leads to a slightly undersized inductor and thus a slightly higher-than-target slew rate. For a conservative design, one should use the minimum expected device voltage, which is $v_0$ in this case.",

The temperature coefficient is $\\alpha_L = -1200\\ \\mathrm{ppm}/^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} = -1200 \\times 10^{-6}\\ /^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. The fractional change due to temperature is $\\alpha_L \\Delta T = (-1200 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times 100 = -0.12$. The temperature derating factor is $k_{temp} = 1 + \\alpha_L \\Delta T = 1 - 0.12 = 0.88$.\n3.  **Magnetic Bias Effect:** The inductance is reduced by $8\\%$ due to DC bias current. The bias derating factor is $k_{bias} = 1 - 0.08 = 0.92$.\n\nThe minimum effective inductance $L_{\\min}$ is the product of the nominal inductance and all derating factors:\n$$L_{\\min} = L_{s,\\mathrm{nom}} \\times k_{mfg} \\times k_{temp} \\times k_{bias}$$\nThe total derating factor, $k_{total}$, is:\n$$k_{total} = k_{mfg} \\times k_{temp} \\times k_{bias} = 0.85 \\times 0.88 \\times 0.92 = 0.68816$$\nSo, $L_{\\min} = L_{s,\\mathrm{nom}} \\times 0.68816$.\n\nWe can now substitute this expression for $L_{\\min}$ back into the worst-case design inequality to find the minimum $L_{s,\\mathrm{nom}}$:\n$$\\frac{V_{dc,\\max}}{L_{s,\\mathrm{nom}} \\times k_{total}} \\le \\left(\\frac{di}{dt}\\right)_{\\max}$$\nSolving for the minimum required $L_{s,\\mathrm{nom}}$:\n$$L_{s,\\mathrm{nom}} \\ge \\frac{V_{dc,\\max}}{k_{total} \\times \\left(\\frac{di}{dt}\\right)_{\\max}}$$\nNow we substitute the numerical values. The rate-of-rise is given as $\\left(\\frac{di}{dt}\\right)_{\\max} = 220\\ \\mathrm{A}/\\mu\\mathrm{s}$. If we solve for inductance using this unit for current slope and volts for voltage, the result will naturally be in microhenries ($\\mu\\mathrm{H}$), because $\\mathrm{V} / (\\mathrm{A}/\\mu\\mathrm{s}) = \\mathrm{V} \\cdot \\mu\\mathrm{s} / \\mathrm{A} = \\mu(\\mathrm{V}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}/\\mathrm{A}) = \\mu\\mathrm{H}$.\n$$L_{s,\\mathrm{nom}} \\ge \\frac{826}{0.68816 \\times 220}$$\n$$L_{s,\\mathrm{nom}} \\ge \\frac{826}{151.3952}$$\n$$L_{s,\\mathrm{nom}} \\ge 5.45596... \\ \\mu\\mathrm{H}$$\nThe problem asks for the minimum nominal inductance that must be specified. We must round this result to four significant figures.\n$$L_{s,\\mathrm{nom}, \\min} \\approx 5.456\\ \\mu\\mathrm{H}$$\nThis is the minimum value for the nominal inductance at $25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ that must be specified to ensure the current slope limit is not violated under the combined worst-case conditions of maximum voltage and minimum effective inductance.",
