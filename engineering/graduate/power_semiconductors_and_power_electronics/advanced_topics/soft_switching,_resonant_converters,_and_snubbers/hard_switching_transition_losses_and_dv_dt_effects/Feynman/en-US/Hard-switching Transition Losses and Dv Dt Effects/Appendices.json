Expression for $\\frac{dV}{dt}$**\n\nThe current charging the MOSFET's output capacitance, $i_C(t)$, is given as the constant load current $I_d$. The fundamental relationship for a capacitor is $i_C = dq/dt$. Using the chain rule, we can express this in terms of voltage:\n$$\ni_C(t) = \\frac{dq}{dt} = \\frac{dq}{dV} \\frac{dV}{dt}\n$$\nBy definition, the differential output capacitance is $C_{\\text{oss}}(V) = dq/dV$. Therefore,\n$$\ni_C(t) = C_{\\text{oss}}(V) \\frac{dV}{dt}\n$$\nSince $i_C(t) = I_d$, we have:\n$$\nI_d = C_{\\text{oss}}(V) \\frac{dV}{dt}\n$$\nSolving for $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ and substituting the given nonlinear model for $C_{\\text{oss}}(V)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\frac{I_d}{C_{\\text{oss}}(V)} = \\frac{I_d}{\\frac{C_0}{\\left(1 + \\frac{V}{V_s}\\right)^m}} = \\frac{I_d}{C_0} \\left(1 + \\frac{V}{V_s}\\right)^m\n$$\nThis expression shows that $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ is a function of the voltage $V$.\n\n**2. Concavity of $V(t)$**\n\nThe concavity of the function $V(t)$ is determined by its second derivative, $\\frac{d^2V}{dt^2}$. We differentiate $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ with respect to time $t$, applying the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2V}{dt^2} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left[ \\frac{I_d}{C_0} \\left(1 + \\frac{V(t)}{V_s}\\right)^m \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d^2V}{dt^2} = \\frac{I_d}{C_0} \\cdot m \\left(1 + \\frac{V(t)}{V_s}\\right)^{m-1} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{V_s}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{dV}{dt}\n$$\nDuring the voltage rise, the voltage $V(t)$ is non-negative, and $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ is positive. The parameters $I_d$, $C_0$, $m$, and $V_s$ are all given as positive. Therefore, every term on the right-hand side is positive:\n$$\n\\frac{I_d}{C_0} > 0, \\quad m > 0, \\quad \\left(1 + \\frac{V(t)}{V_s}\\right)^{m-1} > 0, \\quad \\frac{1}{V_s} > 0, \\quad \\frac{dV}{dt} > 0\n$$\nConsequently, $\\frac{d^2V}{dt^2} > 0$ for the entire duration of the voltage rise. A positive second derivative implies that the function $V(t)$ is **convex**, or **concave upward**. This also means that its slope, $\\frac{dV}{dt}$, increases monotonically as $V$ increases.\n\n**3. Rise Time $t_{\\text{rise}}$**\n\nTo find the total rise time, we separate variables in the differential equation for $\\frac{dV}{dt}$:\n$$\ndt = \\frac{C_{\\text{oss}}(V)}{I_d} dV = \\frac{C_0}{I_d} \\left(1 + \\frac{V}{V_s}\\right)^{-m} dV\n$$\nWe integrate this expression from $t=0$ to $t=t_{\\text{rise}}$ on the left side, and from $V=0$ to $V=V_{\\text{dc}}$ on the right side:\n$$\n\\int_0^{t_{\\text{rise}}} dt = \\int_0^{V_{\\text{dc}}} \\frac{C_0}{I_d} \\left(1 + \\frac{V}{V_s}\\right)^{-m} dV\n$$\n$$\nt_{\\text{rise}} = \\frac{C_0}{I_d} \\int_0^{V_{\\text{dc}}} \\left(1 + \\frac{V}{V_s}\\right)^{-m} dV\n$$\nTo solve the integral, we perform a substitution: let $u = 1 + \\frac{V}{V_s}$. Then $du = \\frac{1}{V_s} dV$, which gives $dV = V_s du$. The limits of integration for $u$ are from $u(0) = 1$ to $u(V_{\\text{dc}}) = 1 + \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{V_s}$.\n$$\nt_{\\text{rise}} = \\frac{C_0}{I_d} \\int_1^{1 + \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{V_s}} u^{-m} (V_s du) = \\frac{C_0 V_s}{I_d} \\int_1^{1 + \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{V_s}} u^{-m} du\n$$\nWe must consider two cases for the value of $m$.\n\n*   **Case 1: $m \\neq 1$**\n    The integral of $u^{-m}$ is $\\frac{u^{-m+1}}{-m+1} = \\frac{u^{1-m}}{1-m}$.\n    $$\n    t_{\\text{rise}} = \\frac{C_0 V_s}{I_d} \\left[ \\frac{u^{1-m}}{1-m} \\right]_1^{1 + \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{V_s}} = \\frac{C_0 V_s}{I_d} \\frac{1}{1-m} \\left( \\left(1 + \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{V_s}\\right)^{1-m} - 1^{1-m} \\right)\n    $$\n    $$\n    t_{\\text{rise}} = \\frac{C_0 V_s}{I_d} \\frac{\\left(1 + \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{V_s}\\right)^{1-m} - 1}{1-m}\n    $$\n*   **Case 2: $m = 1$**\n    The integral of $u^{-1}$ is $\\ln|u|$. Since $u>0$, we use $\\ln(u)$.\n    $$\n    t_{\\text{rise}} = \\frac{C_0 V_s}{I_d} \\left[ \\ln(u) \\right]_1^{1 + \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{V_s}} = \\frac{C_0 V_s}{I_d} \\left( \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{V_s}\\right) - \\ln(1) \\right)\n    $$\n    $$\n    t_{\\text{rise}} = \\frac{C_0 V_s}{I_d} \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{V_s}\\right)\n    $$\n\n**4. Comparison with Constant-Capacitance Model**\n\nThe rise time for the constant-capacitance model is $t_{\\text{const}} = \\frac{C_0 V_{\\text{dc}}}{I_d}$. We can write this as $t_{\\text{const}} = \\frac{1}{I_d} \\int_0^{V_{\\text{dc}}} C_0 dV$.\nThe rise time for the nonlinear model is $t_{\\text{rise}} = \\frac{1}{I_d} \\int_0^{V_{\\text{dc}}} C_{\\text{oss}}(V) dV$.\nThe integrand for the nonlinear case is $C_{\\text{oss}}(V) = \\frac{C_0}{\\left(1 + \\frac{V}{V_s}\\right)^m}$.\nSince $V > 0$, $V_s > 0$, and $m > 0$, the denominator $\\left(1 + \\frac{V}{V_s}\\right)^m > 1$. Therefore, for all $V \\in (0, V_{\\text{dc}}]$, we have $C_{\\text{oss}}(V) < C_0$.\nBecause the integrand for $t_{\\text{rise}}$ is strictly smaller than the integrand for $t_{\\text{const}}$ over the entire interval of integration (except at the point $V=0$), the resulting integral must also be smaller:\n$$\n\\int_0^{V_{\\text{dc}}} C_{\\text{oss}}(V) dV < \\int_0^{V_{\\text{dc}}} C_0 dV\n$$\nThis directly implies that $t_{\\text{rise}} < t_{\\text{const}}$. The nonlinear model predicts a **shorter** rise time.\n\nFurthermore, comparing the rate of voltage change:\n*   Nonlinear model: $\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\frac{I_d}{C_0}\\left(1 + \\frac{V}{V_s}\\right)^m$\n*   Constant-C model: $\\frac{dV}{dt}_{\\text{const}} = \\frac{I_d}{C_0}$\n\nFor any $V > 0$, $\\left(1 + \\frac{V}{V_s}\\right)^m > 1$, so $\\frac{dV}{dt} > \\frac{dV}{dt}_{\\text{const}}$. The nonlinear model predicts a higher $\\frac{dV}{dt}$, especially at higher voltages like near $V_{\\text{dc}}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\frac{I_d}{C_0}\\left(1 + \\frac{V}{V_s}\\right)^{-m}$, hence $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ decreases with $V$ and $V(t)$ is concave downward. The rise time is $t_{\\text{rise}} = \\frac{C_0 V_s}{I_d}\\frac{\\left(1 + \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{V_s}\\right)^{m+1} - 1}{m+1}$, which is longer than $t_{\\text{const}}$.**\n*   **Incorrect**. The expression for $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ has the incorrect exponent ($-m$ instead of $m$). Consequently, the assertions that $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ decreases and $V(t)$ is concave downward are incorrect. The formula for $t_{\\text{rise}}$ is also incorrect, as is the comparison to $t_{\\text{const}}$.\n\n**B. $\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\frac{I_d}{C_{\\text{avg}}}$ where $C_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{V_{\\text{dc}}}\\int_0^{V_{\\text{dc}}} C_{\\text{oss}}(V)\\,dV = C_0$, so $V(t)$ is exactly linear, $t_{\\text{rise}} = \\frac{C_0 V_{\\text{dc}}}{I_d}$, and the nonlinear dependence does not change the $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ profile.**\n*   **Incorrect**. This option equates the average capacitance to $C_0$, which is false; as shown, the average capacitance is less than $C_0$. Because $C_{\\text{oss}}(V)$ is not constant, $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ is not constant, and $V(t)$ is not linear. The rise time is also incorrectly stated as being identical to the constant-capacitance case.\n\n**C. $\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\frac{I_d}{C_{\\text{oss}}(V)} = \\frac{I_d}{C_0}\\left(1 + \\frac{V}{V_s}\\right)^{m}$, so $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ increases monotonically with $V$ and $V(t)$ is convex upward. The rise time is ... (correct formulas for $m \\neq 1$ and $m=1$) ... Compared to $t_{\\text{const}} = \\frac{C_0 V_{\\text{dc}}}{I_d}$, the nonlinear model yields a shorter total rise time and a larger $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ near $V_{\\text{dc}}$.**\n*   **Correct**. This option accurately provides the derived expression for $\\frac{dV}{dt}$. It correctly identifies that $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ increases with $V$, meaning $V(t)$ is convex upward (concave up). It presents the correct integral results for $t_{\\text{rise}}$ for both cases ($m \\neq 1$ and $m = 1$). Finally, its qualitative comparison is correct: the rise time is shorter than for the constant-capacitance model, and the slope $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ is larger, particularly at high voltages.\n\n**D. With $C_{\\text{oss}}(V) = C_0\\left(1 + \\frac{V}{V_s}\\right)^m$, $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ decreases with $V$ and $V(t)$ is concave downward. The rise time is $t_{\\text{rise}} = \\frac{C_0 V_s}{I_d}\\,\\ln\\!\\left(1 + \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{V_s}\\right)$ for all $m$, and the constant-capacitance model underestimates $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ at low $V$ but overestimates it at high $V$.**\n*   **Incorrect**. This option begins by misstating the capacitance model given in the problem statement, inverting the denominator term. All subsequent conclusions are based on this incorrect premise and are themselves flawed. For example, the rise time formula is only valid for $m=1$ in the correct model, not for all $m$ in this incorrect one.\n\n**E. Because $q(V) = C_0 V$ regardless of $m$, both the nonlinear and constant-capacitance models produce identical $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ and $t_{\\text{rise}}$. Any difference appears only in turn-on energy $E_{\\text{oss}} = \\frac{1}{2} C_0 V_{\\text{dc}}^2$, not in the transient shape.**\n*   **Incorrect**. The premise $q(V) = C_0 V$ is false. $q(V) = \\int_0^V C_{\\text{oss}}(v) dv$, which clearly depends on $m$ and is not a linear function of $V$. Consequently, the conclusions that $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ and $t_{\\text{rise}}$ are identical for both models are false. The transient shapes are different.",

All provided data are physically realistic for a modern Silicon Carbide (SiC) power MOSFET and the requested calculations are based on fundamental principles of power electronics. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for two quantities related to the turn-on switching transition of a SiC MOSFET: the duration of the Miller plateau, $t_M$, and the magnitude of the average drain-to-source voltage slew-rate, $\\overline{|\\mathrm{d}v_{ds}/\\mathrm{d}t|}$. Both can be determined using the fundamental relationship between charge ($Q$), current ($I$), and time ($t$). For a constant current, this relationship is given by:\n$$I = \\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta t}$$\nwhere $\\Delta Q$ is the total charge transferred by the current $I$ over the time interval $\\Delta t$.\n\n**1. Calculation of the Miller Plateau Duration ($t_M$)**\n\nDuring the Miller plateau of a MOSFET's turn-on transition, the gate-to-source voltage $v_{gs}$ is approximately constant. The gate driver current, $i_g$, is primarily used to discharge the gate-to-drain capacitance, $C_{gd}$, as the drain-to-source voltage $v_{ds}$ falls. The total charge required to facilitate this voltage swing is the gate-to-drain charge, $Q_{gd}$.\n\nThe problem states that the gate current $i_g$ is constant during this plateau and is entirely directed to supplying $Q_{gd}$. Therefore, we can directly apply the charge-current-time relationship. The time interval is the Miller plateau duration, $t_M$, the constant current is $i_g$, and the total charge transferred is $Q_{gd}$.\n\n$$i_g = \\frac{Q_{gd}}{t_M}$$\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for $t_M$:\n$$t_M = \\frac{Q_{gd}}{i_g}$$\n\nThe given values are:\n- Gate-to-drain charge, $Q_{gd} = 44\\ \\mathrm{nC} = 44 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{C}$.\n- Constant gate current, $i_g = 1.6\\ \\mathrm{A}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $t_M$:\n$$t_M = \\frac{44 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{C}}{1.6\\ \\mathrm{A}} = 27.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{s}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer in nanoseconds ($\\mathrm{ns}$), where $1\\ \\mathrm{ns} = 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{s}$.\n$$t_M = 27.5\\ \\mathrm{ns}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, as requested, gives $t_M = 27.50\\ \\mathrm{ns}$.\n\n**2.

The problem specifies that this final value is negligible compared to $V_{\\text{bus}}$.

You will learn to sum the various energy loss components in a hard-switching cycle and use this total to determine the maximum operating frequency a device can sustain without exceeding its thermal limits, illustrating a fundamental design trade-off.

The components of switching loss (overlap, capacitive discharge, reverse recovery) and their relation to power dissipation are standard analytical concepts. The thermal model ($T_j = T_{\\text{amb}} + P_{\\text{diss}} R_{\\theta JA}$) is a fundamental equation in electronics cooling. The specified values for voltage, capacitance, charge, and thermal resistance are physically realistic for a modern power MOSFET.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed.

The assumptions are clearly articulated.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained and consistent. All required data is provided, and the assumptions (e.g., neglecting conduction loss) serve to define the boundaries of the analysis without introducing contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and internally consistent. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to find the maximum switching frequency, $f_{s,\\text{max}}$, that keeps the MOSFET's junction temperature $T_j$ at or below the specified maximum, $T_{j,\\text{max}}$.\n\nFirst, we determine the maximum permissible average power dissipation, $P_{\\text{diss,max}}$, in the MOSFET. This is dictated by the steady-state thermal equilibrium equation, which relates junction temperature, ambient temperature, power dissipation, and thermal resistance:\n$$T_j = T_{\\text{amb}} + P_{\\text{diss}} R_{\\theta JA}$$\nTo ensure $T_j \\le T_{j,\\text{max}}$, the power dissipation must be limited to $P_{\\text{diss}} \\le P_{\\text{diss,max}}$. The maximum power is found by setting $T_j = T_{j,\\text{max}}$:\n$$P_{\\text{diss,max}} = \\frac{T_{j,\\text{max}} - T_{\\text{amb}}}{R_{\\theta JA}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$T_{j,\\text{max}} = 125\\,{}^{\\circ}\\text{C}$\n$T_{\\text{amb}} = 45\\,{}^{\\circ}\\text{C}$\n$R_{\\theta JA} = 18\\,\\text{K}/\\text{W}$\nNote that a temperature difference in degrees Celsius is equal to a temperature difference in Kelvin.\n$$P_{\\text{diss,max}} = \\frac{125 - 45}{18} \\, \\frac{\\text{K}}{\\text{K/W}} = \\frac{80}{18}\\,\\text{W} = \\frac{40}{9}\\,\\text{W}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total energy, $E_{\\text{total}}$, dissipated in the MOSFET during one complete switching cycle. According to the problem statement, this energy is the sum of the turn-on overlap loss, the turn-off overlap loss, the output capacitance discharge loss, and the reverse-recovery loss.\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = E_{\\text{on,meas}} + E_{\\text{off,meas}} + E_{C_{\\text{oss}}} + E_{\\text{rr}}$$\nThe problem provides models for $E_{C_{\\text{oss}}}$ and $E_{\\text{rr}}$.\nThe energy loss from the output capacitance is given as the energy required to charge it from $0$ to $V_{\\text{dc}}$. This energy stored, $W_C = \\frac{1}{2}CV^2$, is subsequently dissipated in the MOSFET channel during turn-on in a hard-switched converter.\n$$E_{C_{\\text{oss}}} = \\frac{1}{2} C_{\\text{oss}} V_{\\text{dc}}^2$$\nThe reverse-recovery energy loss is approximated as:\n$$E_{\\text{rr}} = Q_{\\text{rr}} V_{\\text{dc}}$$\nNow, we calculate these energy components using the given values:\n$C_{\\text{oss}} = 220\\,\\text{pF} = 220 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{F}$\n$V_{\\text{dc}} = 400\\,\\text{V}$\n$Q_{\\text{rr}} = 60\\,\\text{nC} = 60 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{C}$\n$$E_{C_{\\text{oss}}} = \\frac{1}{2} (220 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{F}) (400\\,\\text{V})^2 = \\frac{1}{2} (220 \\times 10^{-12}) (16 \\times 10^4)\\,\\text{J} = 1760 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\text{J} = 1.76 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{J}$$\n$$E_{\\text{rr}} = (60 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{C}) (400\\,\\text{V}) = 24000 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{J} = 2.4 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{J}$$\nThe measured overlap losses are:\n$E_{\\text{on,meas}} = 0.85\\,\\text{mJ} = 0.85 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{J} = 8.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{J}$\n$E_{\\text{off,meas}} = 0.55\\,\\text{mJ} = 0.55 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{J} = 5.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{J}$\nSumming all components for the total energy per cycle:\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = (8.5 \\times 10^{-4}) + (5.5 \\times 10^{-4}) + (1.76 \\times 10^{-5}) + (2.4 \\times 10^{-5})\\,\\text{J}$$\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = (14.0 \\times 10^{-4}) + (0.176 \\times 10^{-4}) + (0.24 \\times 10^{-4})\\,\\text{J} = (14.0 + 0.176 + 0.24) \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{J}$$\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = 14.416 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{J} = 1.4416 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{J}$$\nThe average power dissipation $P_{\\text{diss}}$ is the product of the total energy per cycle and the switching frequency $f_s$:\n$$P_{\\text{diss}} = E_{\\text{total}} \\times f_s$$\nTo find the maximum allowable switching frequency, we equate the power dissipation to the maximum permissible power dissipation:\n$$P_{\\text{diss,max}} = E_{\\text{total}} \\times f_{s,\\text{max}}$$\nSolving for $f_{s,\\text{max}}$:\n$$f_{s,\\text{max}} = \\frac{P_{\\text{diss,max}}}{E_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{(T_{j,\\text{max}} - T_{\\text{amb}})/R_{\\theta JA}}{E_{\\text{on,meas}} + E_{\\text{off,meas}} + \\frac{1}{2} C_{\\text{oss}} V_{\\text{dc}}^2 + Q_{\\text{rr}} V_{\\text{dc}}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values for power and energy:\n$$f_{s,\\text{max}} = \\frac{40/9\\,\\text{W}}{1.4416 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{J}} \\approx 3082.96335\\,\\text{Hz}$$\nThe problem requires the answer in kilohertz ($\\text{kHz}$) rounded to four significant figures.\n$$f_{s,\\text{max}} \\approx 3.08296335\\,\\text{kHz}$$\nRounding to four significant figures yields:\n$$f_{s,\\text{max}} = 3.083\\,\\text{kHz}$$",
