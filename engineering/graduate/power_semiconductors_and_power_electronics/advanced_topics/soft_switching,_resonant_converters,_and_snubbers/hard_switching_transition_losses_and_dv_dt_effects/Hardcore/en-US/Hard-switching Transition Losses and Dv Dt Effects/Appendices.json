            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All provided data are physically realistic for a modern Silicon Carbide (SiC) power MOSFET and the requested calculations are based on fundamental principles of power electronics. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for two quantities related to the turn-on switching transition of a SiC MOSFET: the duration of the Miller plateau, $t_M$, and the magnitude of the average drain-to-source voltage slew-rate, $\\overline{|\\mathrm{d}v_{ds}/\\mathrm{d}t|}$. Both can be determined using the fundamental relationship between charge ($Q$), current ($I$), and time ($t$). For a constant current, this relationship is given by:\n$$I = \\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta t}$$\nwhere $\\Delta Q$ is the total charge transferred by the current $I$ over the time interval $\\Delta t$.\n\n**1. Calculation of the Miller Plateau Duration ($t_M$)**\n\nDuring the Miller plateau of a MOSFET's turn-on transition, the gate-to-source voltage $v_{gs}$ is approximately constant. The gate driver current, $i_g$, is primarily used to discharge the gate-to-drain capacitance, $C_{gd}$, as the drain-to-source voltage $v_{ds}$ falls. The total charge required to facilitate this voltage swing is the gate-to-drain charge, $Q_{gd}$.\n\nThe problem states that the gate current $i_g$ is constant during this plateau and is entirely directed to supplying $Q_{gd}$. Therefore, we can directly apply the charge-current-time relationship. The time interval is the Miller plateau duration, $t_M$, the constant current is $i_g$, and the total charge transferred is $Q_{gd}$.\n\n$$i_g = \\frac{Q_{gd}}{t_M}$$\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for $t_M$:\n$$t_M = \\frac{Q_{gd}}{i_g}$$\n\nThe given values are:\n- Gate-to-drain charge, $Q_{gd} = 44\\ \\mathrm{nC} = 44 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{C}$.\n- Constant gate current, $i_g = 1.6\\ \\mathrm{A}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $t_M$:\n$$t_M = \\frac{44 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{C}}{1.6\\ \\mathrm{A}} = 27.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{s}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer in nanoseconds ($\\mathrm{ns}$), where $1\\ \\mathrm{ns} = 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{s}$.\n$$t_M = 27.5\\ \\mathrm{ns}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, as requested, gives $t_M = 27.50\\ \\mathrm{ns}$.\n\n**2. Calculation of the Average Drain Voltage Slew-Rate Magnitude ($\\overline{|\\mathrm{d}v_{ds}/\\mathrm{d}t|}$)**\n\nThe average slew-rate of a voltage is defined as the total change in voltage divided by the time duration over which that change occurs. In this case, we are interested in the magnitude of the average drain-to-source voltage slew-rate during the Miller plateau.\n$$\\overline{|\\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{ds}}{\\mathrm{d}t}|} = \\frac{|\\Delta v_{ds}|}{t_M}$$\n\nDuring the turn-on transition, the drain-to-source voltage $v_{ds}$ falls from the DC bus voltage, $V_{\\text{bus}}$, to a value near zero. The problem specifies that this final value is negligible compared to $V_{\\text{bus}}$. Thus, the magnitude of the voltage change is:\n$$|\\Delta v_{ds}| = |0 - V_{\\text{bus}}| = V_{\\text{bus}}$$\n\nThe given DC bus voltage is $V_{\\text{bus}} = 800\\ \\mathrm{V}$. The time duration for this voltage swing is the Miller plateau time, $t_M$, which we calculated in the previous step as $t_M = 27.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{s}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the slew-rate equation:\n$$\\overline{|\\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{ds}}{\\mathrm{d}t}|} = \\frac{V_{\\text{bus}}}{t_M} = \\frac{800\\ \\mathrm{V}}{27.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{s}}$$\n$$\\overline{|\\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{ds}}{\\mathrm{d}t}|} = \\frac{800}{27.5} \\times 10^9\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{V}}{\\mathrm{s}} \\approx 29.090909... \\times 10^9\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{V}}{\\mathrm{s}}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer in units of volts per nanosecond ($\\mathrm{V/ns}$). We use the conversion $1\\ \\mathrm{V/s} = 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{V/ns}$:\n$$\\overline{|\\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{ds}}{\\mathrm{d}t}|} \\approx (29.090909... \\times 10^9) \\times (10^{-9}\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{V/ns}}{\\mathrm{V/s}}) = 29.090909...\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{V}}{\\mathrm{ns}}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, as requested, gives $\\overline{|\\mathrm{d}v_{ds}/\\mathrm{d}t|} = 29.09\\ \\mathrm{V/ns}$.",

According to the problem statement, this energy is the sum of the turn-on overlap loss, the turn-off overlap loss, the output capacitance discharge loss, and the reverse-recovery loss.\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = E_{\\text{on,meas}} + E_{\\text{off,meas}} + E_{C_{\\text{oss}}} + E_{\\text{rr}}$$\nThe problem provides models for $E_{C_{\\text{oss}}}$ and $E_{\\text{rr}}$.\nThe energy loss from the output capacitance is given as the energy required to charge it from $0$ to $V_{\\text{dc}}$.

The datasheet rating at $25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ is $E_{\\mathrm{AS}}(25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) = 30\\,\\mathrm{mJ}$. The problem specifies that this rating is reduced by a factor of $0.70$ at $125^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n$$E_{\\mathrm{AS}}(125^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) = 0.70 \\times E_{\\mathrm{AS}}(25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{AS}}(125^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) = 0.70 \\times 30\\,\\mathrm{mJ} = 21\\,\\mathrm{mJ}$$\nIn Joules, this is $E_{\\mathrm{AS}}(125^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) = 2.1 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{J}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $M$, which quantifies the stress on the device relative to its derated capability.\n$$M = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{av}}}{E_{\\mathrm{AS}}(125^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$M = \\frac{1.764 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{J}}{2.1 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{J}} = \\frac{17.64\\,\\mathrm{mJ}}{21\\,\\mathrm{mJ}} = \\frac{17.64}{21}$$\n$$M = 0.84$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures. To express $0.84$ with four significant figures, we add trailing zeros.\n$$M = 0.8400$$\nThis value indicates that the avalanche event energy is $84\\%$ of the device's maximum rated single-pulse capability at the specified operating temperature.",
