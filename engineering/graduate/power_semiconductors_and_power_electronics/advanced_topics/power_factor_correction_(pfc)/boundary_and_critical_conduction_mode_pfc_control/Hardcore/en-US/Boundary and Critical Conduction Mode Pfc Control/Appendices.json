            "problem": "A single-phase mains Power Factor Correction (PFC) boost converter behind a full-wave diode bridge operates in Critical Conduction Mode (CrCM), also called Boundary Conduction Mode (BCM). In CrCM, the boost inductor current resets to zero each switching cycle. Assume an idealized model in which the boost inductor current in each cycle is a piecewise-linear triangular waveform that starts at zero, rises linearly to a peak, and then decays linearly back to zero, with no delays, no offsets, and no current measurement error.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It presents a standard, well-posed problem in the field of power electronics, based on established scientific principles and using clear, objective language. The assumptions provided, though ideal, are explicitly stated and form a self-contained basis for a rigorous derivation.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Ratio $R \\equiv \\frac{i_{\\text{pk}}}{i_{\\text{avg}}}$.**\n\nThe problem describes the inductor current within a single switching cycle as a piecewise-linear triangular waveform. Let the duration of one switching cycle be $T_{sw}$. Let the local time variable within this cycle be $t'$, ranging from $t'=0$ to $t'=T_{sw}$.\n\nThe current starts at zero, rises linearly to a peak value $i_{\\text{pk}}$ at time $t'=T_{on}$, and then decays linearly back to zero at time $t'=T_{sw}$. The duration of the fall time is $T_{off} = T_{sw} - T_{on}$. The problem states that no assumption should be made about the symmetry of rise and fall slopes, which means $T_{on}$ is not necessarily equal to $T_{off}$.\n\nThe inductor current waveform $i_L(t')$ can be described as:\n$$\ni_L(t') =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{i_{\\text{pk}}}{T_{on}} t' & \\text{for } 0 \\leq t' \\leq T_{on} \\\\\ni_{\\text{pk}} - \\frac{i_{\\text{pk}}}{T_{off}}(t' - T_{on}) & \\text{for } T_{on} < t' \\leq T_{sw}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe problem states that this piecewise-linear behavior results from the inductor law $v_L = L \\frac{di}{dt}$ under the application of piecewise-constant voltages during the on-time and off-time of the boost switch, which is consistent.\n\nThe switching-cycle average current, $i_{\\text{avg}}$, is defined as the average value of this triangular waveform over its period $T_{sw}$. This is calculated by finding the area under the $i_L(t')$ curve and dividing by the period $T_{sw}$.\n$$\ni_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{T_{sw}} \\int_0^{T_{sw}} i_L(t') \\, dt'\n$$\nThe integral represents the area of a triangle with base $T_{sw}$ and height $i_{\\text{pk}}$.

The area calculation does not depend on the position of the peak along the base.\n\nSubstituting this area back into the expression for $i_{\\text{avg}}$:\n$$\ni_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{T_{sw}} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} T_{sw} i_{\\text{pk}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} i_{\\text{pk}}\n$$\nThe ratio $R$ is defined as $R \\equiv \\frac{i_{\\text{pk}}}{i_{\\text{avg}}}$. Using the relationship derived above:\n$$\nR = \\frac{i_{\\text{pk}}}{\\frac{1}{2} i_{\\text{pk}}} = 2\n$$\nThus, for any triangular current waveform that starts and ends at zero, the ratio of the peak value to the cycle-average value is exactly $2$.\n\n**Part 2: Determination of the Line Current Total Harmonic Distortion (THD).**\n\nThe problem specifies a peak tracking control law where the peak inductor current in the $k$-th cycle, $i_{\\text{pk}}(t_k)$, follows the rectified source voltage magnitude:\n$$\ni_{\\text{pk}}(t_k) = \\kappa |v_{s}(t_k)|\n$$\nwhere $\\kappa$ is a constant gain.\n\nFrom Part 1, we know the relationship between the switching-cycle average current $i_{\\text{avg}}(t_k)$ and the peak current $i_{\\text{pk}}(t_k)$ for that cycle is:\n$$\ni_{\\text{avg}}(t_k) = \\frac{1}{2} i_{\\text{pk}}(t_k)\n$$\nCombining these two equations, we find the cycle-average current as a function of the source voltage:\n$$\ni_{\\text{avg}}(t_k) = \\frac{\\kappa}{2} |v_{s}(t_k)|\n$$\nThe problem assumes that the switching frequency is much greater than the line frequency $\\omega$. This allows us to approximate the discrete sequence of cycle averages $i_{\\text{avg}}(t_k)$ with a continuous-time function $i_{\\text{avg}}(t)$. This function represents the low-frequency component of the current drawn from the DC side of the rectifier.\n$$\ni_{\\text{avg}}(t) = \\frac{\\kappa}{2} |v_{s}(t)|\n$$\nThe source voltage is given as $v_{s}(t) = V_{m}\\sin(\\omega t)$. Substituting this into the expression for $i_{\\text{avg}}(t)$:\n$$\ni_{\\text{avg}}(t) = \\frac{\\kappa}{2} |V_{m}\\sin(\\omega t)| = \\frac{\\kappa V_{m}}{2} |\\sin(\\omega t)|\n$$\nThis current $i_{\\text{avg}}(t)$ is the current drawn from the output of the full-wave rectifier. The line current $i_{\\ell}(t)$ seen at the AC source is formed by the \"unfolding\" action of the diode bridge, which is mathematically described as:\n$$\ni_{\\ell}(t) = \\operatorname{sgn}(\\sin(\\omega t)) \\, i_{\\text{avg}}(t)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $i_{\\text{avg}}(t)$:\n$$\ni_{\\ell}(t) = \\operatorname{sgn}(\\sin(\\omega t)) \\left( \\frac{\\kappa V_{m}}{2} |\\sin(\\omega t)| \\right)\n$$\nUsing the mathematical identity $x = \\operatorname{sgn}(x) |x|$, we let $x = \\sin(\\omega t)$. The expression for the line current simplifies to:\n$$\ni_{\\ell}(t) = \\frac{\\kappa V_{m}}{2} \\sin(\\omega t)\n$$\nThis result shows that under the idealized assumptions of the problem, the line current $i_{\\ell}(t)$ is a perfect sinusoid, exactly in phase with the source voltage $v_s(t)$.\n\nThe Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) is defined as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{THD} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty}I_{n}^{2}}}{I_{1}}\n$$\nwhere $I_n$ is the RMS magnitude of the $n$-th harmonic of the current $i_{\\ell}(t)$.\nThe derived line current $i_{\\ell}(t) = \\frac{\\kappa V_{m}}{2} \\sin(\\omega t)$ is a pure sinusoidal waveform at the fundamental frequency $\\omega$. By definition, a pure sinusoid has no harmonic content for $n \\ge 2$. Therefore, the RMS magnitudes of all harmonics are zero:\n$$\nI_n = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } n \\geq 2\n$$\nThe RMS magnitude of the fundamental ($n=1$) is non-zero:\n$$\nI_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( \\frac{\\kappa V_m}{2} \\right) \\neq 0\n$$\nSubstituting these values into the THD formula:\n$$\n\\mathrm{THD} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty}0^{2}}}{I_1} = \\frac{0}{I_1} = 0\n$$\nThe resulting line-current THD under these idealized conditions is exactly $0$.\n\nThe final answer requires the two quantities $(R, \\mathrm{THD})$ in a row matrix.

The PFC controller shapes the switching-cycle average of the inductor current $i_{L}(t)$ to follow a sinusoid in phase with the input voltage, i.e., for each high-frequency switching period $T_{s}(t)$, the average satisfies $i_{\\text{avg}}(t)=\\hat{I}\\sin(\\omega t)$, where $\\hat{I}$ is a constant determined by the delivered power.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains sufficient information for a rigorous derivation. The problem is a standard exercise in power electronics analysis.\n\nThe objective is to derive the crest factor of the input line current for a single-phase boost PFC rectifier operating in Critical Conduction Mode (CrCM). The crest factor ($\\mathrm{CF}$) is defined as the ratio of the maximum instantaneous current $i_{\\max}$ to the root-mean-square (RMS) current $i_{\\mathrm{rms}}$.\n\nLet the instantaneous inductor current, which is the input current drawn from the source, be denoted by $i_{L}(t)$. The problem states that the switching-cycle average of this current is shaped to follow the input voltage waveform. For a rectified sinusoid, the target average current over a switching period $T_s(t)$ is given by:\n$$i_{\\text{avg}}(t) = \\hat{I}|\\sin(\\omega t)|$$\nHere, we use the absolute value $|\\sin(\\omega t)|$ because the inductor current in a boost converter is unidirectional. This formulation is consistent with the problem's statement of $i_{\\text{avg}}(t)=\\hat{I}\\sin(\\omega t)$ when analyzing a single positive half-cycle of the line voltage. All calculations for RMS and average power are identical due to symmetry.\n\nIn CrCM, the inductor current $i_{L}(t)$ for each switching cycle is a triangular waveform starting from zero, rising to a peak value $I_{\\text{pk}}(t)$, and falling back to zero. The duration of this cycle is $T_s(t)$. The average value of a triangular waveform over its period is half its peak value. Therefore, the relationship between the switching-cycle average current and the peak current within that cycle is:\n$$i_{\\text{avg}}(t) = \\frac{1}{2}I_{\\text{pk}}(t)$$\nCombining this with the target average current, we can express the peak current envelope as a function of time:\n$$I_{\\text{pk}}(t) = 2 i_{\\text{avg}}(t) = 2 \\hat{I} |\\sin(\\omega t)|$$\n\nThe maximum instantaneous current, $i_{\\max}$, is the maximum value that $i_{L}(t)$ reaches over an entire line period. This occurs at the peak of the envelope $I_{\\text{pk}}(t)$, which corresponds to times when $|\\sin(\\omega t)| = 1$.\n$$i_{\\max} = \\max_{t} [I_{\\text{pk}}(t)] = 2 \\hat{I} \\max_{t} [|\\sin(\\omega t)|] = 2\\hat{I}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the RMS value of the inductor current, $i_{\\mathrm{rms}}$. The RMS value is the square root of the mean of the square of the instantaneous current over a line period $T = 2\\pi/\\omega$.\n$$i_{\\mathrm{rms}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} i_{L}(t)^2 \\, dt}$$\nSince the switching frequency is assumed to be much higher than the line frequency, we can employ a two-step averaging process. First, we find the mean-square value of the current over a single switching cycle, $\\langle i_{L}^2 \\rangle_{T_s}$, and then we average this value over the line period $T$.\n\nFor a triangular waveform with peak height $I_{\\text{pk}}$ and zero mean, the RMS value is $I_{\\text{pk}} / \\sqrt{3}$. Consequently, its mean-square value is:\n$$\\langle i_{L}^2 \\rangle_{T_s}(t) = \\left(\\frac{I_{\\text{pk}}(t)}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{I_{\\text{pk}}(t)^2}{3}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $I_{\\text{pk}}(t)$:\n$$\\langle i_{L}^2 \\rangle_{T_s}(t) = \\frac{(2 \\hat{I} |\\sin(\\omega t)|)^2}{3} = \\frac{4\\hat{I}^2}{3}\\sin^2(\\omega t)$$\nNow, we average this quantity over one line period $T$:\n$$i_{\\mathrm{rms}}^2 = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} \\langle i_{L}^2 \\rangle_{T_s}(t) \\, dt = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} \\frac{4\\hat{I}^2}{3}\\sin^2(\\omega t) \\, dt$$\n$$i_{\\mathrm{rms}}^2 = \\frac{4\\hat{I}^2}{3} \\left( \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} \\sin^2(\\omega t) \\, dt \\right)$$\nThe time average of $\\sin^2(\\omega t)$ over a full period is $1/2$.\n$$\\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} \\sin^2(\\omega t) \\, dt = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} \\frac{1-\\cos(2\\omega t)}{2} \\, dt = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $i_{\\mathrm{rms}}^2$:\n$$i_{\\mathrm{rms}}^2 = \\frac{4\\hat{I}^2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{2\\hat{I}^2}{3}$$\nThe RMS current is therefore:\n$$i_{\\mathrm{rms}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\hat{I}^2}{3}} = \\hat{I}\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the crest factor using its definition:\n$$\\mathrm{CF} = \\frac{i_{\\max}}{i_{\\mathrm{rms}}} = \\frac{2\\hat{I}}{\\hat{I}\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}} = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}} = \\sqrt{4 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2}} = \\sqrt{6}$$\nThe exact value of the crest factor is $\\sqrt{6}$. To provide a numerical answer rounded to $4$ significant figures:\n$$\\mathrm{CF} = \\sqrt{6} \\approx 2.4494897... \\approx 2.449$$\n\nThe high crest factor of $\\sqrt{6}$ is a fundamental characteristic of ideal CrCM operation with a sinusoidal current reference. It is approximately $73\\%$ higher than the crest factor of a pure sine wave, which is $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414$. This high peak-to-RMS current ratio increases conduction losses and requires semiconductor devices with higher current ratings.\n\nTo limit this crest factor, the control strategy or mode of operation must be modified, as the CF value is intrinsic to the triangular current shape of CrCM.\n1.  **Modify Control Strategy to Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM):** Operating in CCM, where the inductor current does not return to zero in each cycle, is the most direct way to reduce the crest factor. The current waveform becomes a smaller triangular ripple superimposed on the desired sinusoidal average current. The peak instantaneous current is then closer to the peak of the average current, and the CF approaches the ideal value of $\\sqrt{2}$. The primary consequence of CCM operation is the loss of zero-voltage switching (ZVS) for the main switch, leading to significantly higher turn-on switching losses. Additionally, the hard commutation of the boost diode creates reverse-recovery losses and increased electromagnetic interference (EMI).\n\n2.  **Adjusting Inductance ($L$):** Within the constraints of ideal CrCM, the choice of inductance $L$ does not alter the crest factor of $\\sqrt{6}$. The inductance value, however, determines the switching frequency $f_s(t) = 1/T_s(t)$ for a given set of operating conditions (input/output voltages and power). A smaller inductance $L$ results in higher switching frequencies, which increases switching losses but allows for smaller magnetic components. Conversely, a larger inductance lowers the switching frequency, reducing switching losses at the cost of a physically larger and more expensive inductor. The designer must choose $L$ to manage the trade-off between component size and efficiency and to keep the variable switching frequency within an acceptable range.\n\n3.  **Multi-Mode Control:** Advanced control schemes combine modes. For instance, a controller can operate the PFC in CCM near the line voltage peak (where current is high and reducing CF is most critical) and transition to CrCM near the line zero-crossings (where current is low and the ZVS benefit of CrCM improves efficiency). This hybrid approach can optimize performance across the entire line cycle but requires a more complex control algorithm to manage the mode transitions smoothly without introducing current distortion.\n\nIn summary, the high crest factor is a major drawback of CrCM. The primary method to mitigate it involves moving to CCM or a hybrid CCM/CrCM scheme, which involves a fundamental trade-off between conduction losses (related to CF) and switching losses (related to ZVS and diode recovery).",

A detailed solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nLet the instantaneous line voltage be $v_{\\text{in}}(t) = V_p \\sin(\\omega_{\\text{line}} t)$, where $V_p$ is the peak voltage. Since the PFC rectifier operates at unity power factor, the instantaneous input current $i_{\\text{in}}(t)$ is in phase with the voltage: $i_{\\text{in}}(t) = I_p \\sin(\\omega_{\\text{line}} t)$, where $I_p$ is the peak current.\n\nThe instantaneous input power, $p_{\\text{in}}(t)$, is the product of the instantaneous input voltage and current:\n$$p_{\\text{in}}(t) = v_{\\text{in}}(t) i_{\\text{in}}(t) = (V_p \\sin(\\omega_{\\text{line}} t))(I_p \\sin(\\omega_{\\text{line}} t)) = V_p I_p \\sin^2(\\omega_{\\text{line}} t)$$\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\sin^2(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\cos(2\\theta))$, we can rewrite the instantaneous power as:\n$$p_{\\text{in}}(t) = \\frac{V_p I_p}{2}(1 - \\cos(2\\omega_{\\text{line}} t))$$\nThe average input power, $P_{\\text{in}}$, is the DC component of this expression:\n$$P_{\\text{in}} = \\frac{V_p I_p}{2}$$\nSince semiconductor losses are neglected, the system is lossless, and the average input power must equal the constant output power delivered to the load, $P_o$. Thus, $P_{\\text{in}} = P_o$. Substituting this back into the expression for instantaneous input power gives:\n$$p_{\\text{in}}(t) = P_o(1 - \\cos(2\\omega_{\\text{line}} t))$$\nThis equation shows that the instantaneous power drawn from the line consists of a constant component $P_o$ that is delivered to the load and an oscillating component $-P_o \\cos(2\\omega_{\\text{line}} t)$ that flows at twice the line frequency. By the principle of conservation of energy, this oscillating power component must be absorbed and supplied by the output capacitor, $C_o$.\n\nThe power flowing into the capacitor, $p_C(t)$, is the difference between the instantaneous input power and the constant output power:\n$$p_C(t) = p_{\\text{in}}(t) - P_o = P_o(1 - \\cos(2\\omega_{\\text{line}} t)) - P_o = -P_o \\cos(2\\omega_{\\text{line}} t)$$\nThe power absorbed by a capacitor is also given by the product of its voltage $v_o(t)$ and current $i_C(t)$:\n$$p_C(t) = v_o(t) i_C(t)$$\nThe capacitor current is related to its voltage by the constitutive relation $i_C(t) = C_o \\frac{dv_o(t)}{dt}$. Substituting this gives:\n$$p_C(t) = C_o v_o(t) \\frac{dv_o(t)}{dt}$$\nThe problem states that the output voltage ripple $\\tilde{v}(t)$ is small compared to the DC component $V_o$, so we can make the approximation $v_o(t) \\approx V_o$ in the term multiplying the derivative. This is a standard small-ripple approximation.\n$$p_C(t) \\approx C_o V_o \\frac{dv_o(t)}{dt}$$\nNow, we equate the two expressions for $p_C(t)$:\n$$C_o V_o \\frac{dv_o(t)}{dt} = -P_o \\cos(2\\omega_{\\text{line}} t)$$\nTo find the voltage variation, we can integrate this equation with respect to time. The voltage $v_o(t)$ is composed of the DC component $V_o$ and the ripple component $\\tilde{v}(t)$, so $v_o(t) = V_o + \\tilde{v}(t)$. Its derivative is $\\frac{dv_o(t)}{dt} = \\frac{d\\tilde{v}(t)}{dt}$. The equation becomes:\n$$C_o V_o \\frac{d\\tilde{v}(t)}{dt} = -P_o \\cos(2\\omega_{\\text{line}} t)$$\nIntegrating to find the ripple voltage $\\tilde{v}(t)$:\n$$\\tilde{v}(t) = \\int \\frac{-P_o}{C_o V_o} \\cos(2\\omega_{\\text{line}} t) \\, dt = -\\frac{P_o}{C_o V_o} \\frac{\\sin(2\\omega_{\\text{line}} t)}{2\\omega_{\\text{line}}} + \\text{constant}$$\nThe ripple voltage is a sinusoidal function with an amplitude (peak value) of:\n$$\\tilde{V}_{\\text{peak}} = \\frac{P_o}{2\\omega_{\\text{line}} C_o V_o}$$\nThe peak-to-peak ripple voltage, $\\Delta v_{\\text{pp}}$, is twice this amplitude:\n$$\\Delta v_{\\text{pp}} = 2 \\tilde{V}_{\\text{peak}} = \\frac{P_o}{\\omega_{\\text{line}} C_o V_o}$$\nThe problem requires that this ripple does not exceed a fraction $r$ of the DC output voltage $V_o$:\n$$\\Delta v_{\\text{pp}} \\le r V_o$$\nSubstituting our expression for $\\Delta v_{\\text{pp}}$:\n$$\\frac{P_o}{\\omega_{\\text{line}} C_o V_o} \\le r V_o$$\nTo satisfy this condition, the capacitance $C_o$ must be greater than or equal to a certain minimum value. We solve for $C_o$:\n$$C_o \\ge \\frac{P_o}{r \\omega_{\\text{line}} V_o^2}$$\nThe minimum required capacitance is therefore:\n$$C_{o, \\text{min}} = \\frac{P_o}{r \\omega_{\\text{line}} V_o^2}$$\nSubstituting $\\omega_{\\text{line}} = 2 \\pi f_{\\text{line}}$ gives the final symbolic expression:\n$$C_{o, \\text{min}} = \\frac{P_o}{2 \\pi f_{\\text{line}} r V_o^2}$$\n\n**Numerical Computation**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n$P_o = 750 \\ \\text{W}$\n$V_o = 400 \\ \\text{V}$\n$f_{\\text{line}} = 50 \\ \\text{Hz}$\n$r = 0.03$\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived expression for the minimum capacitance:\n$$C_o = \\frac{750}{2 \\pi (50) (0.03) (400)^2}$$\n$$C_o = \\frac{750}{100 \\pi (0.03) (160000)}$$\n$$C_o = \\frac{750}{3 \\pi (160000)}$$\n$$C_o = \\frac{750}{480000 \\pi} = \\frac{1}{640 \\pi} \\ \\text{F}$$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$$C_o \\approx \\frac{1}{640 \\times 3.14159265...} \\approx \\frac{1}{2010.619} \\approx 4.97359 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\text{F}$$\nThe problem asks for the result in microfarads ($\\mu\\text{F}$):\n$$C_o \\approx (4.97359 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times 10^6 \\ \\mu\\text{F} \\approx 497.359 \\ \\mu\\text{F}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$C_o \\approx 497 \\ \\mu\\text{F}$$",
