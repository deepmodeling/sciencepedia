            "problem": "A single-phase Power Factor Correction (PFC) front end is operated such that the input current is shaped to be sinusoidal and in phase with the line voltage. Consider two advanced topologies: a bridgeless boost PFC and a continuous-conduction-mode totem-pole PFC. In both cases, assume that the current through the series conduction path that includes the active devices follows an ideal sinusoid of angular frequency $\\omega$ with zero direct-current component and has a root-mean-square (RMS) value of $10\\,\\text{A}$ over one line period.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It presents a standard power electronics analysis problem with clear, simplified device models and sufficient data for a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a full solution can be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation and calculation of conduction power dissipation in three different PFC front-end conduction paths. The input current $i(t)$ is given as a pure sinusoid with a root-mean-square (RMS) value of $I_{\\mathrm{rms}} = 10\\,\\text{A}$. Let the current be described by $i(t) = I_{\\mathrm{peak}} \\sin(\\omega t)$, where $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of the AC line and $T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}$ is the period.\n\nThe relationship between the peak value $I_{\\mathrm{peak}}$ and the RMS value $I_{\\mathrm{rms}}$ for a sinusoidal waveform is given by the definition of RMS:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{rms}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} i(t)^2 \\,dt} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} (I_{\\mathrm{peak}} \\sin(\\omega t))^2 \\,dt}$$\n$$I_{\\mathrm{rms}}^2 = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{peak}}^2}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} \\sin^2(\\omega t) \\,dt = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{peak}}^2}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} \\frac{1-\\cos(2\\omega t)}{2} \\,dt$$\n$$I_{\\mathrm{rms}}^2 = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{peak}}^2}{2T} \\left[t - \\frac{\\sin(2\\omega t)}{2\\omega}\\right]_{0}^{T} = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{peak}}^2}{2T} (T - 0) = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{peak}}^2}{2}$$\nTherefore, $I_{\\mathrm{peak}} = \\sqrt{2} I_{\\mathrm{rms}}$.\n\nThe average power dissipation $P$ is defined as $P = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} v(t)i(t)\\,dt$, where $v(t)$ is the instantaneous voltage drop across the conducting device.\n\n1.  **Conduction Power of the Bridgeless MOSFET Path ($P_{\\mathrm{b}}$)**\n    For the bridgeless boost PFC, the conducting MOSFET is modeled with a constant on-state resistance $R_{\\mathrm{b}} = 40\\,\\mathrm{m}\\Omega = 0.040\\,\\Omega$. The instantaneous voltage drop is $v_{\\mathrm{b}}(t) = R_{\\mathrm{b}}i(t)$. The average conduction power dissipation, $P_{\\mathrm{b}}$, is derived as follows:\n    $$P_{\\mathrm{b}} = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} v_{\\mathrm{b}}(t)i(t) \\,dt = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} (R_{\\mathrm{b}}i(t))i(t) \\,dt = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{b}}}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} i(t)^2 \\,dt$$\n    By the definition of RMS current, $I_{\\mathrm{rms}}^2 = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} i(t)^2 \\,dt$. Substituting this into the power equation gives the expression for the conduction power:\n    $$P_{\\mathrm{b}} = R_{\\mathrm{b}}I_{\\mathrm{rms}}^2$$\n\n2.  **Conduction Power of the Totem-Pole Path ($P_{\\mathrm{tp}}$)**\n    For the totem-pole PFC, two series GaN HEMT devices conduct, each with an on-state resistance of $R_{\\mathrm{tp}} = 15\\,\\mathrm{m}\\Omega = 0.015\\,\\Omega$. The total series resistance in the conduction path is $2R_{\\mathrm{tp}}$. The instantaneous voltage drop is $v_{\\mathrm{tp}}(t) = (2R_{\\mathrm{tp}})i(t)$. The derivation for the average power, $P_{\\mathrm{tp}}$, is analogous to the bridgeless case:\n    $$P_{\\mathrm{tp}} = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} v_{\\mathrm{tp}}(t)i(t) \\,dt = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} (2R_{\\mathrm{tp}}i(t))i(t) \\,dt = \\frac{2R_{\\mathrm{tp}}}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} i(t)^2 \\,dt$$\n    Using the definition of RMS current as before:\n    $$P_{\\mathrm{tp}} = (2R_{\\mathrm{tp}})I_{\\mathrm{rms}}^2$$\n\n3.  **Conduction Power of the Diode Path ($P_{\\mathrm{d}}$)**\n    For the diode path, the forward voltage drop is a constant $V_{\\mathrm{f}} = 0.9\\,\\text{V}$. In a full-wave rectification context, current flows through a path with this voltage drop during both the positive and negative halves of the line cycle. The instantaneous power dissipation is $p_{\\mathrm{d}}(t) = v_{\\mathrm{d}}(t)i(t)$. The voltage drop opposes the current flow, so its magnitude is always $V_{\\mathrm{f}}$, and its sign is the same as the current's sign. Thus, the instantaneous power is $p_{\\mathrm{d}}(t) = V_{\\mathrm{f}}|i(t)|$.\n\n    The average power dissipation, $P_{\\mathrm{d}}$, is found by averaging this instantaneous power over one period:\n    $$P_{\\mathrm{d}} = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} V_{\\mathrm{f}}|i(t)| \\,dt = V_{\\mathrm{f}} \\left(\\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} |i(t)| \\,dt\\right)$$\n    The term in the parenthesis is the average magnitude of the rectified current, $I_{\\mathrm{avg}}$. We derive this value from the integral:\n    $$I_{\\mathrm{avg}} = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} |I_{\\mathrm{peak}}\\sin(\\omega t)| \\,dt = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{peak}}}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} |\\sin(\\omega t)| \\,dt$$\n    The integral of the rectified sine wave over one period ($0$ to $T$) is twice the integral over a half-period ($0$ to $T/2$):\n    $$\\int_{0}^{T} |\\sin(\\omega t)| \\,dt = 2 \\int_{0}^{T/2} \\sin(\\omega t) \\,dt = 2 \\left[-\\frac{\\cos(\\omega t)}{\\omega}\\right]_{0}^{T/2}$$\n    Substituting the limits, and recalling $T=2\\pi/\\omega$ implies $\\omega T/2 = \\pi$:\n    $$2 \\left(-\\frac{\\cos(\\pi)}{\\omega} - \\left(-\\frac{\\cos(0)}{\\omega}\\right)\\right) = 2 \\left(-\\frac{-1}{\\omega} + \\frac{1}{\\omega}\\right) = \\frac{4}{\\omega} = \\frac{4}{2\\pi/T} = \\frac{2T}{\\pi}$$\n    Substituting this back into the expression for $I_{\\mathrm{avg}}$:\n    $$I_{\\mathrm{avg}} = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{peak}}}{T} \\left(\\frac{2T}{\\pi}\\right) = \\frac{2}{\\pi}I_{\\mathrm{peak}}$$\n    Thus, the power dissipation is $P_{\\mathrm{d}} = V_{\\mathrm{f}} I_{\\mathrm{avg}} = \\frac{2}{\\pi}V_{\\mathrm{f}}I_{\\mathrm{peak}}$.\n    To express this in terms of $I_{\\mathrm{rms}}$, we substitute $I_{\\mathrm{peak}} = \\sqrt{2}I_{\\mathrm{rms}}$:\n    $$P_{\\mathrm{d}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi}V_{\\mathrm{f}}I_{\\mathrm{rms}}$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical values.\nGiven parameters:\n$I_{\\mathrm{rms}} = 10\\,\\text{A}$\n$R_{\\mathrm{b}} = 0.040\\,\\Omega$\n$R_{\\mathrm{tp}} = 0.015\\,\\Omega$, so $2R_{\\mathrm{tp}} = 0.030\\,\\Omega$\n$V_{\\mathrm{f}} = 0.9\\,\\text{V}$\n\nConduction power for each path:\n-   $P_{\\mathrm{tp}} = (2R_{\\mathrm{tp}})I_{\\mathrm{rms}}^2 = (0.030\\,\\Omega)(10\\,\\text{A})^2 = 0.030 \\times 100 = 3.0\\,\\text{W}$.\n-   $P_{\\mathrm{d}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi}V_{\\mathrm{f}}I_{\\mathrm{rms}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi}(0.9\\,\\text{V})(10\\,\\text{A}) = \\frac{18\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi}\\,\\text{W}$.\n    $P_{\\mathrm{d}} \\approx 8.102863\\,\\text{W}$.\n\nThe absolute conduction power advantage of the totem-pole path over the diode path is $\\Delta P = P_{\\mathrm{d}} - P_{\\mathrm{tp}}$.\n$$\\Delta P = \\left(\\frac{18\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi}\\right) - 3.0$$\n$$\\Delta P \\approx 8.102863 - 3.0 = 5.102863\\,\\text{W}$$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $5.103\\,\\text{W}$.\n(For completeness, the bridgeless power is $P_{\\mathrm{b}} = R_{\\mathrm{b}}I_{\\mathrm{rms}}^2 = (0.040\\,\\Omega)(10\\,\\text{A})^2 = 4.0\\,\\text{W}$.)",

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of power electronics, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively stated. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation from first principles. Let the AC line voltage be a pure sinusoid, given by $v(t) = \\sqrt{2} V_{\\mathrm{rms}} \\sin(\\omega t)$, where $V_{\\mathrm{rms}}$ is the root-mean-square voltage and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency. The input line current $i(t)$ is periodic and non-sinusoidal. It can be represented by its Fourier series. Given the provided root-mean-square (RMS) magnitudes of its harmonic components, the instantaneous current is:\n$$i(t) = \\sum_{n \\in \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 11\\}} i_n(t) = \\sum_{n \\in \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 11\\}} \\sqrt{2} I_n \\sin(n\\omega t + \\phi_n)$$\nwhere $I_n$ is the RMS magnitude of the $n$-th harmonic and $\\phi_n$ is its phase angle. The problem states that the input current is phase-aligned with the line voltage, which implies the displacement angle, i.e., the phase of the fundamental component, is zero. Thus, $\\phi = \\phi_1 = 0$ radians.\n\nFirst, we determine the total RMS value of the input current, $I_{\\mathrm{rms}}$. By definition, the RMS value of a periodic function composed of orthogonal sinusoidal components is the square root of the sum of the squares of the RMS values of each component.\n$$I_{\\mathrm{rms}} = \\sqrt{\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} I_n^2}$$\nGiven the harmonic content, this becomes:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{rms}} = \\sqrt{I_1^2 + I_3^2 + I_5^2 + I_7^2 + I_{11}^2}$$\nThe problem provides the magnitudes of the harmonics as fractions of the fundamental, $I_1$:\n$I_3 = 0.2 I_1$\n$I_5 = 0.1 I_1$\n$I_7 = 0.05 I_1$\n$I_{11} = 0.03 I_1$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $I_{\\mathrm{rms}}$:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{rms}} = \\sqrt{I_1^2 + (0.2 I_1)^2 + (0.1 I_1)^2 + (0.05 I_1)^2 + (0.03 I_1)^2}$$\n$$I_{\\mathrm{rms}} = I_1 \\sqrt{1^2 + 0.2^2 + 0.1^2 + 0.05^2 + 0.03^2}$$\n$$I_{\\mathrm{rms}} = I_1 \\sqrt{1 + 0.04 + 0.01 + 0.0025 + 0.0009} = I_1 \\sqrt{1.0534}$$\n\nNow we can calculate the three requested quantities.\n\n1.  **Total Harmonic Distortion ($THD$)**\n    The $THD$ of the current is defined as the ratio of the RMS value of all harmonic components (excluding the fundamental) to the RMS value of the fundamental component.\n    $$THD = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} I_n^2}}{I_1}$$\n    For this problem, the sum is over the given harmonics $n=3, 5, 7, 11$:\n    $$THD = \\frac{\\sqrt{I_3^2 + I_5^2 + I_7^2 + I_{11}^2}}{I_1}$$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$THD = \\frac{\\sqrt{(0.2 I_1)^2 + (0.1 I_1)^2 + (0.05 I_1)^2 + (0.03 I_1)^2}}{I_1}$$\n    The term $I_1$ cancels out:\n    $$THD = \\sqrt{0.2^2 + 0.1^2 + 0.05^2 + 0.03^2} = \\sqrt{0.04 + 0.01 + 0.0025 + 0.0009}$$\n    $$THD = \\sqrt{0.0534} \\approx 0.2310844$$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, $THD = 0.2311$.\n\n2.  **Distortion Factor ($D$)**\n    The distortion factor $D$ is defined as the ratio of the RMS value of the fundamental component of the current to the total RMS value of the current.\n    $$D = \\frac{I_1}{I_{\\mathrm{rms}}}$$\n    Using our derived expression for $I_{\\mathrm{rms}}$:\n    $$D = \\frac{I_1}{I_1 \\sqrt{1.0534}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1.0534}}$$\n    $$D \\approx \\frac{1}{1.0263527} \\approx 0.974325$$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, $D = 0.9743$.\n    It is useful to note the relationship $D = 1/\\sqrt{1+THD^2}$, which is consistent with our calculations.\n\n3.  **Overall Power Factor ($PF$)**\n    The power factor $PF$ is defined as the ratio of the real power $P$ to the apparent power $S$.\n    $$PF = \\frac{P}{S}$$\n    The apparent power is the product of the total RMS voltage and total RMS current:\n    $$S = V_{\\mathrm{rms}} I_{\\mathrm{rms}}$$\n    The real power $P$ is the average power consumed over one period $T = 2\\pi/\\omega$.

Therefore, only the fundamental component of the current ($n=1$) contributes to the real power.\n    $$P = \\frac{2 V_{\\mathrm{rms}} I_1}{T} \\int_0^T \\sin(\\omega t) \\sin(\\omega t + \\phi_1) dt$$\n    Using the trigonometric integral identity $\\int_0^T \\sin(\\omega t) \\sin(\\omega t + \\phi_1) dt = \\frac{T}{2} \\cos(\\phi_1)$, the real power simplifies to:\n    $$P = V_{\\mathrm{rms}} I_1 \\cos(\\phi_1)$$\n    The term $\\cos(\\phi_1)$ is the displacement factor. The problem states the current is phase-aligned with the voltage, so $\\phi_1 = 0$ radians, and $\\cos(0) = 1$.\n    Thus, $P = V_{\\mathrm{rms}} I_1$.\n    Now we can compute the power factor:\n    $$PF = \\frac{P}{S} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{rms}} I_1}{V_{\\mathrm{rms}} I_{\\mathrm{rms}}} = \\frac{I_1}{I_{\\mathrm{rms}}}$$\n    This expression is identical to the definition of the distortion factor $D$. Therefore, for a unity displacement factor, $PF = D$.\n    $$PF = D \\approx 0.974325$$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, $PF = 0.9743$.\n\nThe three requested quantities, rounded to four significant figures, are:\n- $THD = 0.2311$\n- $D = 0.9743$\n- $PF = 0.9743$",

The components are operating within their specified temperature limits, suggesting reliable operation. However, this margin may not be sufficient to accommodate significant excursions in ambient temperature, overload conditions, or component degradation over time without potentially exceeding the rating.\n\nThe problem asks for a final answer containing only the numerical values of $P_{\\text{loss}}$ and $\\eta$.\n$P_{\\text{loss}} = 30.00\\,\\text{W}$\n$\\eta = 0.9852$",
            "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 30.00  0.9852 \\end{pmatrix}}$$"
