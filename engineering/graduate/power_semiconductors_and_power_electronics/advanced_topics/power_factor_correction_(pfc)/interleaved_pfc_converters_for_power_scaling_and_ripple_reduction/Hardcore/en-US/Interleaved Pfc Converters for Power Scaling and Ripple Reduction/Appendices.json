            "problem": "An $N$-phase interleaved boost front-end used for Power Factor Correction (PFC) is fed from a single-phase sinusoidal source of line angular frequency $\\omega$ and peak voltage $V_{m}$. An ideal full-wave diode bridge precedes the interleaved boost stage so that the input to each boost phase is the rectified sinusoid $v_{g}(t)=V_{m}|\\sin(\\omega t)|$. The $N$ boost phases are identical, operate in continuous conduction mode (CCM), and are interleaved uniformly in switching phase such that their switching carriers are shifted by $2\\pi/N$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is first subjected to a rigorous validation process.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **System Description**: An $N$-phase interleaved boost front-end for Power Factor Correction (PFC).\n- **Input Source**: Single-phase sinusoidal source with line angular frequency $\\omega$ and peak voltage $V_{m}$.\n- **Rectifier**: Ideal full-wave diode bridge.\n- **Input to Boost Stage**: Rectified sinusoid $v_{g}(t)=V_{m}|\\sin(\\omega t)|$.\n- **Boost Stage Configuration**: $N$ identical boost phases, operating in continuous conduction mode (CCM), uniformly interleaved in switching phase by $2\\pi/N$.\n- **Switching Frequency**: $f_{s}$, satisfying the condition $2\\pi f_{s}\\gg \\omega$.\n- **Output**: A regulated constant DC voltage $V_{o}$ across a large output capacitor.\n- **Assumptions**:\n    1. Ideal semiconductors (zero conduction and switching losses).\n    2. Negligible parasitic elements.\n    3. Negligible output voltage ripple (i.e., output voltage is a pure DC value, $V_o$).\n    4. Since separation ($2\\pi f_s \\gg \\omega$), the input voltage $v_g(t)$ is considered constant over a single switching period $T_s = 1/f_s$.\n- **Constraints**:\n    1. $0 < v_{g}(t) < V_{o}$ for all $t$.\n    2. $0 < D(t) < 1$.\n- **Task**: Derive the ideal instantaneous duty cycle $D(t)$ from first principles: (1) inductor voltage–time balance over one switching period, and (2) conservation of energy at steady state.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is analyzed for validity.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem describes a standard power electronics circuit (an interleaved boost PFC converter) and requests a derivation based on fundamental, universally accepted principles: inductor volt-second balance and conservation of energy. The model is idealized, which is a standard and valid practice for deriving fundamental operating equations. The setup is entirely consistent with the laws of physics and circuit theory.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides sufficient information and a clear set of assumptions (CCM, ideal components, time-scale separation) to allow for the derivation of a unique, stable, and meaningful expression for the duty cycle $D(t)$. The goal is unambiguously defined. The information about the $N$-phase interleaving is descriptive of the converter architecture but, as the problem notes by specifying a common duty cycle $D(t)$, does not alter the fundamental voltage conversion relationship being derived.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, technical language, free from subjective or biased terms.\n- **Conclusion**: The problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains no internal contradictions or ambiguities. It is a standard, fundamental problem in power electronics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. The derivation of the solution will now proceed.\n\nThe objective is to derive the expression for the instantaneous duty cycle, $D(t)$, for an ideal boost converter. The problem specifies that this derivation must be based on two principles: inductor volt-second balance and conservation of energy. The analysis is performed on a single phase of the interleaved converter, as the duty cycle is stipulated to be common to all phases.\n\nThe operation of a boost converter in continuous conduction mode (CCM) over a single switching period $T_s = 1/f_s$ is characterized by two states. Let the main switch (e.g., a MOSFET) be turned on for a duration of $D(t)T_s$ and off for a duration of $(1-D(t))T_s$.\n\n**1. Derivation from Inductor Voltage–Time Balance (Volt-Second Balance)**\n\nThe principle of inductor volt-second balance states that for periodic operation, the average voltage across the inductor over one full period must be zero. Here, the period is the switching period $T_s$. The time-scale separation assumption, $f_s \\gg \\omega/(2\\pi)$, justifies treating the low-frequency input voltage $v_g(t)$ and the control variable $D(t)$ as constant within this short interval.\n\n- **State 1: Switch is ON (duration $D(t)T_s$)**: The inductor is connected directly across the input voltage source. The voltage across the inductor, $v_L$, is equal to the input voltage at that instant.\n$$v_L = v_g(t)$$\n- **State 2: Switch is OFF (duration $(1-D(t))T_s$)**: The inductor current is directed to the output through the boost diode. The voltage across the inductor is the input voltage minus the output voltage.\n$$v_L = v_g(t) - V_o$$\nApplying the volt-second balance principle, we integrate the inductor voltage over one switching period $T_s$ and set the average to zero:\n$$\\frac{1}{T_s} \\int_0^{T_s} v_L(\\tau) d\\tau = 0$$\n$$\\frac{1}{T_s} \\left[ \\int_0^{D(t)T_s} v_g(t) d\\tau + \\int_{D(t)T_s}^{T_s} (v_g(t) - V_o) d\\tau \\right] = 0$$\nSince $v_g(t)$ and $V_o$ are constant over this interval, the integration is straightforward:\n$$[v_g(t) \\cdot D(t)T_s] + [(v_g(t) - V_o) \\cdot (1-D(t))T_s] = 0$$\nDividing by $T_s$:\n$$v_g(t)D(t) + (v_g(t) - V_o)(1 - D(t)) = 0$$\n$$v_g(t)D(t) + v_g(t) - v_g(t)D(t) - V_o + V_o D(t) = 0$$\n$$v_g(t) - V_o + V_o D(t) = 0$$\nThis yields the fundamental voltage conversion ratio for a boost converter:\n$$V_o(1 - D(t)) = v_g(t)$$\n\n**2. Derivation from Conservation of Energy (Instantaneous Power Balance)**\n\nFor an ideal converter with no energy storage elements that accumulate net energy over a cycle and no loss mechanisms, the instantaneous input power must equal the instantaneous output power. This is a direct consequence of the conservation of energy. Let $i_L(t)$ be the slowly varying (line-frequency component) of the inductor current.\n\n- **Instantaneous Input Power**: The power drawn from the input source is $p_{in}(t) = v_g(t) i_{in}(t)$. In a boost converter, the input current is the inductor current, so $i_{in}(t) = i_L(t)$.\n$$p_{in}(t) = v_g(t) i_L(t)$$\n- **Instantaneous Output Power**: Power is delivered to the output only when the boost diode is conducting, which occurs during the switch OFF-time. The current delivered to the output is the inductor current $i_L(t)$ during this interval. Averaged over a switching cycle $T_s$, the output current is $i_{out}(t) = (1-D(t)) i_L(t)$. The power delivered to the constant voltage output is $p_{out}(t) = V_o i_{out}(t)$.\n$$p_{out}(t) = V_o (1-D(t)) i_L(t)$$\nBy equating instantaneous input and output power, $p_{in}(t) = p_{out}(t)$:\n$$v_g(t) i_L(t) = V_o (1-D(t)) i_L(t)$$\nSince the converter operates in CCM, the inductor current $i_L(t)$ is always positive. We can therefore divide by $i_L(t)$:\n$$v_g(t) = V_o (1-D(t))$$\nThis result is identical to the one obtained from volt-second balance. This is expected, as both principles are fundamental and must be simultaneously satisfied in a consistent, idealized physical model.\n\n**3. Final Expression for the Duty Cycle**\n\nFrom the derived relationship, we solve for the instantaneous duty cycle $D(t)$.\n$$1 - D(t) = \\frac{v_g(t)}{V_o}$$\n$$D(t) = 1 - \\frac{v_g(t)}{V_o}$$\nThe problem provides the expression for the rectified input voltage to the boost stage:\n$$v_g(t) = V_m |\\sin(\\omega t)|$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $D(t)$:\n$$D(t) = 1 - \\frac{V_m |\\sin(\\omega t)|}{V_o}$$\nThis is the final expression for the ideal instantaneous duty cycle required to shape the input current for power factor correction while maintaining a regulated output voltage $V_o$. The constraint $v_g(t) < V_o$ ensures that $D(t)$ remains positive, and $v_g(t) > 0$ ensures $D(t) < 1$, consistent with the problem's assumptions.",

            "problem": "A three-phase rectified utility interface is upgraded to an interleaved boost Power Factor Correction (PFC) front-end. Initially, the front-end uses $N \\geq 2$ identical interleaved phases operating in Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM), each with inductance $L$, identical duty ratio $D$ at any fixed point on the line cycle, and identical switching frequency $f_{s}$ per phase. The phases are uniformly interleaved with time shift $T_{s}/N$, where $T_{s} = 1/f_{s}$. The input voltage $v_{g}(t)$ varies at the line frequency, but over any switching period it is quasi-constant. The direct current (DC) bus voltage is regulated and constant.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of power electronics, well-posed with sufficient information, and objective in its formulation. It presents a standard engineering scenario involving interleaved converters, free from any of the specified invalidity criteria. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem asks for two ratios resulting from an upgrade of an interleaved boost converter from $N$ to $N+M$ phases. Let the initial (old) system be denoted by the subscript 'old' and the upgraded (new) system by 'new'.\n\n**1. Ratio of Average Current Per Phase, $I_{\\text{phase,new}}/I_{\\text{phase,old}}$**\n\nThe analysis begins with the principle of power balance. The total instantaneous input power, $P_{\\text{in}}$, is given as constant. The input power is the product of the quasi-constant input voltage, $v_g(t)$, and the total average input current, $I_{\\text{in,avg}}(t)$.\n$$P_{\\text{in}} = v_g(t) \\cdot I_{\\text{in,avg}}(t)$$\nSince $P_{\\text{in}}$ and $v_g(t)$ are unchanged by the upgrade, the total average input current $I_{\\text{in,avg}}(t)$ must also remain constant. Let us denote this constant total average current simply as $I_{\\text{in}}$.\n\nIn the initial configuration with $N$ identical phases, the total average input current is the sum of the average currents of each phase. Since all phases are identical, they share the total current equally.\n$$I_{\\text{in}} = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} I_{\\text{phase,old}} = N \\cdot I_{\\text{phase,old}}$$\n\nIn the upgraded configuration with $N+M$ identical phases, the total average input current is similarly shared among all phases.\n$$I_{\\text{in}} = \\sum_{k=1}^{N+M} I_{\\text{phase,new}} = (N+M) \\cdot I_{\\text{phase,new}}$$\n\nBy equating the expressions for the conserved total input current $I_{\\text{in}}$, we have:\n$$N \\cdot I_{\\text{phase,old}} = (N+M) \\cdot I_{\\text{phase,new}}$$\nRearranging this equation yields the desired ratio of the average current per phase:\n$$\\frac{I_{\\text{phase,new}}}{I_{\\text{phase,old}}} = \\frac{N}{N+M}$$\n\n**2. Ratio of RMS Input Switching Ripple, $I_{\\text{ripple,RMS,new}}/I_{\\text{ripple,RMS,old}}$**\n\nThis part of the analysis relies on the principle of linear superposition applied to the phase-shifted ripple currents and their Fourier series representation.\n\nLet the inductor current ripple for a single phase (say, phase $1$) be denoted by the periodic function $\\Delta i_{\\text{ph}}(t)$ with period $T_s = 1/f_s$. By definition, this ripple has a zero average value. The problem states that the peak-to-peak amplitude of this ripple, $\\Delta i$, is the same for all phases and remains unchanged after the upgrade. This is because the per-phase inductor voltage waveform is determined by $v_g$, the DC bus voltage, and the duty cycle $D$, which are all unchanged. Specifically, for a boost converter, the inductor current slope is $v_g/L$ during the on-time $DT_s$, so the peak-to-peak ripple is $\\Delta i = v_g D T_s / L$. Since $v_g$, $D$, $T_s$, and $L$ are all invariant, $\\Delta i$ is invariant. Consequently, the entire ripple waveform $\\Delta i_{\\text{ph}}(t)$ is identical before and after the upgrade.\n\nThe Fourier series of this per-phase triangular ripple waveform can be written. The problem states that the magnitude of its $m$-th harmonic, $C_m$, scales as $1/m^2$. We can thus write $C_m = K/m^2$ for some constant $K$ that depends on the specific shape and amplitude of the ripple waveform. Since the waveform $\\Delta i_{\\text{ph}}(t)$ is unchanged, the constant $K$ is the same for both the old and new systems.\n\nThe total input current ripple is the sum of the individual phase ripples. Due to interleaving, the ripple of phase $k$ is time-shifted relative to phase $1$.\nIn the initial system with $N$ phases, the phase shift is $T_s/N$, so the total input ripple is:\n$$\\Delta i_{\\text{in,old}}(t) = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\Delta i_{\\text{ph}}\\left(t - \\frac{(k-1)T_s}{N}\\right)$$\nIn the frequency domain, a time shift of $\\tau$ corresponds to a phase shift of $e^{-j m \\omega_s \\tau}$ for the $m$-th harmonic. The $m$-th harmonic of the total current ripple is the sum of the phasors from each phase. Its magnitude, $A_{m, \\text{old}}$, is given by:\n$$A_{m, \\text{old}} = C_m \\left| \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\exp\\left(-j m \\omega_s \\frac{(k-1)T_s}{N}\\right) \\right| = C_m \\left| \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\exp\\left(-j \\frac{2\\pi m k}{N}\\right) \\right|$$\nThis is a geometric series sum which evaluates to $N$ if $m$ is a multiple of $N$ (i.e., $m=qN$ for integer $q \\geq 1$) and to $0$ otherwise. This is the principle of harmonic cancellation by interleaving.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, we consider only the dominant harmonic, which is the lowest-frequency nonzero harmonic. For the $N$-phase system, this occurs at $m=N$. The magnitude of this dominant harmonic in the total input current is:\n$$A_{\\text{old}} = N \\cdot C_N = N \\cdot \\left(\\frac{K}{N^2}\\right) = \\frac{K}{N}$$\nThe root-mean-square (RMS) value of this sinusoidal harmonic is its amplitude divided by $\\sqrt{2}$:\n$$I_{\\text{ripple,RMS,old}} = \\frac{A_{\\text{old}}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{K}{N\\sqrt{2}}$$\n\nNow, we apply the same reasoning to the upgraded system with $N+M$ phases. The uniform phase shift is now $T_s/(N+M)$. The lowest-frequency nonzero harmonic now occurs at $m = N+M$. The magnitude of this dominant harmonic in the total input current is:\n$$A_{\\text{new}} = (N+M) \\cdot C_{N+M}$$\nSince the per-phase ripple waveform is unchanged, we use the same harmonic scaling law $C_m = K/m^2$:\n$$A_{\\text{new}} = (N+M) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{K}{(N+M)^2}\\right) = \\frac{K}{N+M}$$\nThe corresponding RMS value is:\n$$I_{\\text{ripple,RMS,new}} = \\frac{A_{\\text{new}}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{K}{(N+M)\\sqrt{2}}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio of the new RMS ripple to the old RMS ripple:\n$$\\frac{I_{\\text{ripple,RMS,new}}}{I_{\\text{ripple,RMS,old}}} = \\frac{\\frac{K}{(N+M)\\sqrt{2}}}{\\frac{K}{N\\sqrt{2}}} = \\frac{K}{(N+M)\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{N\\sqrt{2}}{K} = \\frac{N}{N+M}$$\n\nThe two derived ratios are identical.

First, the peak voltage $V_p$:\n$$V_p = \\sqrt{2} \\times 90\\,\\text{V}$$\n$$V_p^2 = (\\sqrt{2} \\times 90)^2 = 2 \\times 90^2 = 16200\\,\\text{V}^2$$\nNow, substitute all values into the equation for $L_{\\min}$:\n$$L_{\\min} = \\frac{4 \\times 16200}{2 \\times 0.30 \\times (1 \\times 10^5) \\times 2000} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{2} \\times 90}{400}\\right)$$\n$$L_{\\min} = \\frac{64800}{1.2 \\times 10^8} \\left(1 - \\frac{90\\sqrt{2}}{400}\\right)$$\n$$L_{\\min} = 5.4 \\times 10^{-4} \\left(1 - \\frac{9\\sqrt{2}}{40}\\right)\\,\\text{H}$$\nNumerically evaluating the expression:\n$$L_{\\min} \\approx 5.4 \\times 10^{-4} \\left(1 - \\frac{9 \\times 1.41421356}{40}\\right) \\approx 5.4 \\times 10^{-4} (1 - 0.318198)$$\n$$L_{\\min} \\approx 5.4 \\times 10^{-4} \\times 0.681802\\,\\text{H}$$\n$$L_{\\min} \\approx 3.68173 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{H}$$\nThe result must be expressed in microhenries ($\\mu\\text{H}$):\n$$L_{\\min} \\approx 368.173\\,\\mu\\text{H}$$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested:\n$$L_{\\min} \\approx 368\\,\\mu\\text{H}$$",
