            "problem": "A three-phase grid-connected voltage source converter employs synchronous reference frame current control with a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) aligned to the positive-sequence grid voltage so that the synchronous $d$-axis tracks the grid voltage phasor and the synchronous $q$-axis is in quadrature. The grid is weak, and its voltage amplitude varies by $\\pm 10$\\% around a nominal line-to-line root-mean-square (RMS) value. Assume a balanced, sinusoidal, positive-sequence grid with negligible zero-sequence and harmonics, and that the converter’s current controller commands constant direct-quadrature currents $(i_d, i_q)$ in steady state.\n\nStarting from the instantaneous three-phase active power definition $p = v_a i_a + v_b i_b + v_c i_c$, the corresponding reactive power definition based on the orthogonal decomposition of the space vectors, and the properties of the Park/Clarke transformations, derive the mapping from synchronous-frame voltages and currents to average active power $P$ and reactive power $Q$. Explicitly state the sign convention you adopt for $Q$ in the synchronous frame. Then, specialize to the case where the PLL maintains $v_q \\approx 0$, and express $P$ and $Q$ in terms of $v_d$, $i_d$, and $i_q$.\n\nFor numerical concreteness, take the nominal grid line-to-line RMS voltage to be $V_{\\text{LL,rms}} = 400~\\text{V}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of active and reactive power expressions in the synchronous reference frame ($dq$-frame), followed by an analysis of their sensitivity to grid voltage variations under constant current control. The problem is validated to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of Active and Reactive Power in the Synchronous Frame\n\nWe begin with the definition of instantaneous three-phase active power, $p(t)$, for a three-phase, three-wire system:\n$$p(t) = v_a(t) i_a(t) + v_b(t) i_b(t) + v_c(t) i_c(t)$$\nThe problem asks to use the properties of Clarke and Park transformations. We will use the amplitude-invariant form of the Clarke transformation, which maps the phase quantities $(v_a, v_b, v_c)$ to the stationary $\\alpha\\beta$ frame $(v_\\alpha, v_\\beta)$. For a balanced system (zero-sequence component is zero), this transformation preserves the amplitude of the fundamental component. The transformation for voltages is:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} v_\\alpha \\\\ v_\\beta \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{2}{3} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -\\frac{1}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2} \\\\ 0 & \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_a \\\\ v_b \\\\ v_c \\end{pmatrix} $$\nAn identical transformation applies to the currents $(i_a, i_b, i_c)$. For a balanced system, it can be shown that the instantaneous power is given by:\n$$ p(t) = \\frac{3}{2} (v_\\alpha i_\\alpha + v_\\beta i_\\beta) $$\nThis expression represents the total instantaneous power in terms of the stationary frame components. For balanced sinusoidal steady-state conditions, this value is constant and equal to the average active power, $P$.\n\nThe problem also requires defining reactive power $Q$. We define the complex power $S$ in the stationary frame using space vectors $\\vec{v}_{\\alpha\\beta} = v_\\alpha + jv_\\beta$ and $\\vec{i}_{\\alpha\\beta} = i_\\alpha + ji_\\beta$. The complex power is:\n$$ S = P + jQ = \\frac{3}{2} \\vec{v}_{\\alpha\\beta} \\vec{i}_{\\alpha\\beta}^* $$\nwhere $^*$ denotes the complex conjugate. Expanding this gives:\n$$ S = \\frac{3}{2} (v_\\alpha + jv_\\beta)(i_\\alpha - ji_\\beta) = \\frac{3}{2} [ (v_\\alpha i_\\alpha + v_\\beta i_\\beta) + j(v_\\beta i_\\alpha - v_\\alpha i_\\beta) ] $$\nBy equating the real and imaginary parts, we identify the average active power $P$ and reactive power $Q$:\n$$ P = \\frac{3}{2} (v_\\alpha i_\\alpha + v_\\beta i_\\beta) $$\n$$ Q = \\frac{3}{2} (v_\\beta i_\\alpha - v_\\alpha i_\\beta) $$\n\nNext, we apply the Park transformation, which rotates the stationary frame $(\\alpha, \\beta)$ by an angle $\\theta(t)$ to obtain the synchronous frame $(d, q)$. The angle $\\theta(t)$ is provided by the Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) and for a grid frequency $\\omega_g$, $\\theta(t) = \\omega_g t + \\theta_0$. The relationship between the space vectors is:\n$$ \\vec{v}_{dq} = v_d + jv_q = \\vec{v}_{\\alpha\\beta} e^{-j\\theta(t)} $$\n$$ \\vec{i}_{dq} = i_d + ji_q = \\vec{i}_{\\alpha\\beta} e^{-j\\theta(t)} $$\nThe complex power expression is invariant under this rotation:\n$$ S = \\frac{3}{2} \\vec{v}_{\\alpha\\beta} \\vec{i}_{\\alpha\\beta}^* = \\frac{3}{2} (\\vec{v}_{dq}e^{j\\theta}) (\\vec{i}_{dq}e^{j\\theta})^* = \\frac{3}{2} (\\vec{v}_{dq}e^{j\\theta}) (\\vec{i}_{dq}^*e^{-j\\theta}) = \\frac{3}{2} \\vec{v}_{dq} \\vec{i}_{dq}^* $$\nExpanding this in terms of $dq$ components:\n$$ S = \\frac{3}{2} (v_d + jv_q)(i_d - ji_q) = \\frac{3}{2} [ (v_d i_d + v_q i_q) + j(v_q i_d - v_d i_q) ] $$\nThus, the mapping from synchronous-frame voltages and currents to average active and reactive power is:\n$$ P = \\frac{3}{2} (v_d i_d + v_q i_q) $$\n$$ Q = \\frac{3}{2} (v_q i_d - v_d i_q) $$\n\nThe problem asks to state the sign convention for $Q$. In this formulation $S = P+jQ$, with the PLL aligning $v_d$ to the voltage vector (so $v_q = 0$), a lagging current (inductive, $i_q < 0$) results in $Q = -\\frac{3}{2}v_d i_q > 0$. Therefore, a positive $Q$ corresponds to the injection of inductive reactive power from the converter to the grid.\n\n### Part 2: Specialization for $v_q \\approx 0$\n\nThe problem specifies that the PLL maintains perfect alignment of the $d$-axis with the grid voltage phasor. Under balanced, sinusoidal conditions, the grid voltage space vector rotates at a constant magnitude and frequency. A perfect PLL tracks this rotation such that the entire voltage vector is projected onto the $d$-axis. This implies that the quadrature component of the voltage is zero. We therefore set $v_q = 0$. Note the problem states $v_q \\approx 0$, but for an ideal steady-state analysis, we take it to be exactly zero.\nSubstituting $v_q = 0$ into the power expressions yields:\n$$ P = \\frac{3}{2} v_d i_d $$\n$$ Q = -\\frac{3}{2} v_d i_q $$\n\n### Part 3: Numerical Evaluation and Fractional Deviations\n\nFirst, we compute the nominal synchronous $d$-axis voltage amplitude, $v_{d,0}$. The nominal line-to-line RMS voltage is given as $V_{\\text{LL,rms}} = 400~\\text{V}$. For a balanced wye-connected system, the line-to-neutral RMS voltage $V_{\\text{LN,rms}}$ is:\n$$ V_{\\text{LN,rms}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{LL,rms}}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{400}{\\sqrt{3}}~\\text{V} $$\nThe problem states that $v_d$ equals the line-to-neutral peak voltage. The peak voltage $V_{\\text{LN,peak}}$ is $\\sqrt{2}$ times the RMS value:\n$$ v_{d,0} = V_{\\text{LN,peak}} = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot V_{\\text{LN,rms}} = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\frac{400}{\\sqrt{3}} = 400 \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}~\\text{V} $$\n\nNext, we model the weak-grid voltage variation as $v_d = v_{d,0} (1 + \\varepsilon)$ where $\\varepsilon \\in [-0.1, 0.1]$. The currents $(i_d, i_q)$ are held constant by the controller. We can now express the active power $P(\\varepsilon)$ and reactive power $Q(\\varepsilon)$ as functions of $\\varepsilon$.\n$$ P(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{3}{2} v_d i_d = \\frac{3}{2} [v_{d,0}(1+\\varepsilon)] i_d = \\left(\\frac{3}{2} v_{d,0} i_d\\right) (1+\\varepsilon) $$\n$$ Q(\\varepsilon) = -\\frac{3}{2} v_d i_q = -\\frac{3}{2} [v_{d,0}(1+\\varepsilon)] i_q = \\left(-\\frac{3}{2} v_{d,0} i_q\\right) (1+\\varepsilon) $$\nThe nominal powers, $P_0$ and $Q_0$, correspond to $\\varepsilon = 0$:\n$$ P_0 = P(0) = \\frac{3}{2} v_{d,0} i_d $$\n$$ Q_0 = Q(0) = -\\frac{3}{2} v_{d,0} i_q $$\nTherefore, $P(\\varepsilon) = P_0 (1+\\varepsilon)$ and $Q(\\varepsilon) = Q_0 (1+\\varepsilon)$.\n\nWe are asked to find the fractional deviations $\\Delta P / P_0$ and $\\Delta Q / Q_0$. We assume that the converter is operating at a point where $i_d \\neq 0$ and $i_q \\neq 0$, such that $P_0 \\neq 0$ and $Q_0 \\neq 0$.\nThe deviation in active power is $\\Delta P = P(\\varepsilon) - P_0 = P_0(1+\\varepsilon) - P_0 = P_0 \\varepsilon$. The fractional deviation is:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta P}{P_0} = \\frac{P_0 \\varepsilon}{P_0} = \\varepsilon $$\nSimilarly, the deviation in reactive power is $\\Delta Q = Q(\\varepsilon) - Q_0 = Q_0(1+\\varepsilon) - Q_0 = Q_0 \\varepsilon$. The fractional deviation is:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta Q}{Q_0} = \\frac{Q_0 \\varepsilon}{Q_0} = \\varepsilon $$\nThe fractional deviations in both active and reactive power are equal to $\\varepsilon$.\n\nFinally, we must report the maximum fractional deviations. The range for $\\varepsilon$ is $[-0.1, 0.1]$. The term \"maximum fractional deviation\" is interpreted as the maximum absolute value of this fractional change.\nThe maximum absolute value of $\\varepsilon$ is $|\\pm 0.1| = 0.1$.\nTherefore, the maximum fractional deviation for active power is:\n$$ \\max\\left|\\frac{\\Delta P}{P_0}\\right| = \\max|\\varepsilon| = 0.1 $$\nAnd the maximum fractional deviation for reactive power is:\n$$ \\max\\left|\\frac{\\Delta Q}{Q_0}\\right| = \\max|\\varepsilon| = 0.1 $$\nThe problem asks for these two values as decimals in a single row matrix.",

KCL at the central node: $I_f(s) = I_g(s) + I_c(s)$\n\nThe voltage at the central node, $V_{node}(s)$, is the voltage across the series combination of $R_d$ and $C_f$. The current through this branch is $I_c(s)$.\n$V_{node}(s) = I_c(s) \\left(R_d + \\frac{1}{sC_f}\\right) = I_c(s) \\frac{1+sR_d C_f}{sC_f}$.\n\nTo analyze the filter's characteristics, we typically derive the transfer function from the control input (converter voltage $V_i$) to the controlled output (grid current $I_g$). We set the disturbance input $V_g(s) = 0$.\n\nFrom (2) with $V_g(s)=0$, we have $V_{node}(s) = sL_g I_g(s)$.\nThe current through the capacitor branch is $I_c(s) = \\frac{V_{node}(s)}{R_d + 1/(sC_f)} = \\frac{sL_g I_g(s) sC_f}{1+sR_d C_f} = \\frac{s^2 L_g C_f}{1+sR_d C_f} I_g(s)$.\n\nFrom (3), we express $I_f(s)$ in terms of $I_g(s)$:\n$I_f(s) = I_g(s) + I_c(s) = I_g(s) \\left(1 + \\frac{s^2 L_g C_f}{1+sR_d C_f}\\right) = I_g(s) \\frac{1+sR_d C_f + s^2 L_g C_f}{1+sR_d C_f}$.\n\nNow, substitute $V_{node}(s)$ and $I_f(s)$ into (1):\n$V_i(s) = sL_f I_f(s) + sL_g I_g(s)$\n$V_i(s) = sL_f \\left(I_g(s) \\frac{1+sR_d C_f + s^2 L_g C_f}{1+sR_d C_f}\\right) + sL_g I_g(s)$\n$V_i(s) = I_g(s) \\left[ \\frac{sL_f(1+sR_d C_f + s^2 L_g C_f)}{1+sR_d C_f} + sL_g \\right]$\n$V_i(s) = I_g(s) \\frac{sL_f(1+sR_d C_f + s^2 L_g C_f) + sL_g(1+sR_d C_f)}{1+sR_d C_f}$\n\nThe transfer function $G(s) = \\frac{I_g(s)}{V_i(s)}$ is:\n$G(s) = \\frac{1+sR_d C_f}{s^3 L_f L_g C_f + s^2 (L_f+L_g)R_d C_f + s(L_f+L_g)}$\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of the system is the denominator:\n$P(s) = s(L_f+L_g) \\left[ \\frac{s^2 L_f L_g C_f}{L_f+L_g} + \\frac{s(L_f+L_g)R_d C_f}{L_f+L_g} + 1 \\right]$\nThe poles are at $s=0$ (an integrator) and the roots of the quadratic term in the brackets. The oscillatory mode is described by this quadratic characteristic equation:\n$s^2 \\frac{L_f L_g C_f}{L_f+L_g} + s R_d C_f + 1 = 0$\nDividing by the coefficient of $s^2$ to match the standard form $s^2 + 2\\zeta\\omega_n s + \\omega_n^2 = 0$:\n$s^2 + s \\frac{R_d C_f (L_f+L_g)}{L_f L_g C_f} + \\frac{L_f+L_g}{L_f L_g C_f} = 0$\n$s^2 + s \\frac{R_d(L_f+L_g)}{L_f L_g} + \\frac{L_f+L_g}{L_f L_g C_f} = 0$\n\nFrom this standard form, we identify the squared undamped natural resonance frequency $\\omega_n^2$ and the damping term $2\\zeta\\omega_n$:\n$\\omega_n^2 = \\frac{L_f+L_g}{L_f L_g C_f} = \\frac{1}{C_f}\\left(\\frac{1}{L_f} + \\frac{1}{L_g}\\right)$\n$2\\zeta\\omega_n = \\frac{R_d(L_f+L_g)}{L_f L_g} = R_d\\left(\\frac{1}{L_f} + \\frac{1}{L_g}\\right)$\n\n**Part 1: Resonance Frequency Range Analysis**\n\nThe resonance frequency is $f_n = \\omega_n / (2\\pi)$.\n$f_n = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{C_f}\\left(\\frac{1}{L_f} + \\frac{1}{L_g}\\right)}$\nAs $L_g$ increases, the term $1/L_g$ decreases, causing the entire expression under the square root to decrease. Thus, **as $L_g$ increases, the resonance frequency $f_n$ decreases**.\n\nNow, we calculate the bounds of the frequency range using the given values:\n$L_f = 1.8 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{H}$\n$C_f = 20 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{F}$\n$L_g \\in [0.6 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{H}, 1.8 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{H}]$\n\n- **Maximum frequency $f_{n,max}$ (occurs at minimum $L_g = 0.6\\,\\mathrm{mH}$):**\n$\\omega_{n,max}^2 = \\frac{1}{20 \\times 10^{-6}}\\left(\\frac{1}{1.8 \\times 10^{-3}} + \\frac{1}{0.6 \\times 10^{-3}}\\right) = 5 \\times 10^4 \\left(555.56 + 1666.67\\right) = 5 \\times 10^4 \\times 2222.22 = 1.111 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{rad}^2/\\mathrm{s}^2$\n$\\omega_{n,max} = \\sqrt{1.111 \\times 10^8} \\approx 10541\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$\n$f_{n,max} = \\frac{10541}{2\\pi} \\approx 1677.6\\,\\mathrm{Hz} \\approx 1.68\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$\n\n- **Minimum frequency $f_{n,min}$ (occurs at maximum $L_g = 1.8\\,\\mathrm{mH}$):**\n$\\omega_{n,min}^2 = \\frac{1}{20 \\times 10^{-6}}\\left(\\frac{1}{1.8 \\times 10^{-3}} + \\frac{1}{1.8 \\times 10^{-3}}\\right) = 5 \\times 10^4 \\left(2 \\times \\frac{1}{1.8 \\times 10^{-3}}\\right) = 5 \\times 10^4 \\times 1111.11 = 5.556 \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{rad}^2/\\mathrm{s}^2$\n$\\omega_{n,min} = \\sqrt{5.556 \\times 10^7} \\approx 7453.5\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$\n$f_{n,min} = \\frac{7453.5}{2\\pi} \\approx 1186.2\\,\\mathrm{Hz} \\approx 1.19\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$\n\nThe resonance frequency lies in the interval $[1.19\\,\\mathrm{kHz}, 1.68\\,\\mathrm{kHz}]$.\n\n**Part 2: Damping Resistor Calculation**\n\nWe need to ensure $\\zeta \\ge \\zeta_{\\min} = 0.2$ for all $L_g$ in its range. The damping ratio $\\zeta$ is found by:\n$\\zeta = \\frac{2\\zeta\\omega_n}{2\\omega_n} = \\frac{R_d\\left(\\frac{1}{L_f} + \\frac{1}{L_g}\\right)}{2 \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{C_f}\\left(\\frac{1}{L_f} + \\frac{1}{L_g}\\right)}} = \\frac{R_d}{2} \\sqrt{C_f\\left(\\frac{1}{L_f} + \\frac{1}{L_g}\\right)}$\n\nTo satisfy $\\zeta \\ge \\zeta_{\\min}$, we must have:\n$R_d \\ge \\frac{2\\zeta_{\\min}}{\\sqrt{C_f\\left(\\frac{1}{L_f} + \\frac{1}{L_g}\\right)}}$\n\nTo guarantee this for all $L_g$, we must find the value of $L_g$ that maximizes the right-hand side, which corresponds to the \"worst-case\" scenario for damping. The term $\\sqrt{C_f\\left(\\frac{1}{L_f} + \\frac{1}{L_g}\\right)}$ is in the denominator. As $L_g$ increases, this term decreases. Therefore, the required minimum $R_d$ is maximized when the denominator is minimized. This occurs at the maximum value of $L_g$.\n\nThe worst-case for damping is at $L_g = L_{g,max} = 1.8\\,\\mathrm{mH}$. We must calculate the required $R_d$ for this case:\n$R_{d,min} = \\frac{2 \\times 0.2}{\\sqrt{20 \\times 10^{-6} \\left(\\frac{1}{1.8 \\times 10^{-3}} + \\frac{1}{1.8 \\times 10^{-3}}\\right)}}$\n$R_{d,min} = \\frac{0.4}{\\sqrt{20 \\times 10^{-6} \\left(\\frac{2}{1.8 \\times 10^{-3}}\\right)}} = \\frac{0.4}{\\sqrt{\\frac{40 \\times 10^{-6}}{1.8 \\times 10^{-3}}}} = \\frac{0.4}{\\sqrt{0.0222...}}$\n$R_{d,min} = \\frac{0.4}{0.14907} \\approx 2.683\\,\\Omega$\n\nTo guarantee $\\zeta \\ge 0.2$ across the entire range of $L_g$, we must choose a damping resistor $R_d \\ge 2.683\\,\\Omega$. Rounding to two significant figures, this is $R_d \\ge 2.7\\,\\Omega$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.** As $L_g$ increases, the resonance frequency decreases.
