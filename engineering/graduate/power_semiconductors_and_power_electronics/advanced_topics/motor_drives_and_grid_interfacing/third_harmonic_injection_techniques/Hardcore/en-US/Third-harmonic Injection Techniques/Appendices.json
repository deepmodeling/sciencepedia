This exercise guides you through a first-principles derivation to determine how adding a third-harmonic component to a sinusoidal reference alters its peak value, allowing for a larger fundamental amplitude without causing overmodulation .

            "problem": "Consider a three-phase Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) implementing Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM) with third-harmonic injection for phase-$a$. The normalized phase reference is given by\n$$\nv_a^{*}(t) = m \\sin(\\omega t) + k \\sin(3 \\omega t),\n$$\nwhere $m$ is the fundamental modulation amplitude, $k > 0$ is the fixed third-harmonic injection amplitude, and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency. Angles are measured in radians. The normalized direct current (DC) bus voltage is unity, and to avoid overmodulation the reference must satisfy\n$$\n|v_a^{*}(t)| \\leq 1 \\quad \\text{for all } t.\n$$\nStarting from first principles of calculus and trigonometric identities, derive closed-form expressions for\n$$\n\\max_{t} v_a^{*}(t) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\min_{t} v_a^{*}(t),\n$$\nwithout assuming any special relationship between $m$ and $k$ beyond $k > 0$.

            "solution": "The problem is to find the maximum allowable fundamental modulation amplitude $m$ for a given third-harmonic injection amplitude $k$ such that the normalized phase reference voltage $v_a^{*}(t)$ does not exceed the normalized DC bus voltage.\n\nThe normalized phase reference is given by\n$$v_a^{*}(t) = m \\sin(\\omega t) + k \\sin(3 \\omega t)$$\nwith the constraint\n$$|v_a^{*}(t)| \\leq 1 \\quad \\text{for all } t.$$\n\nThis is equivalent to ensuring that the global maximum of $|v_a^{*}(t)|$ is less than or equal to $1$. Let $V_{peak} = \\max_t |v_a^{*}(t)|$. We must find an expression for $V_{peak}$ as a function of $m$ and $k$, and then find the largest $m$, denoted $m_{max}(k)$, for which $V_{peak} \\leq 1$.\n\nFirst, we derive the expressions for the maximum and minimum of $v_a^{*}(t)$. Let $x = \\omega t$. Since $t$ spans all real numbers, $\\sin(\\omega t)$ will span its full range $[-1, 1]$. We can analyze the function by letting $s = \\sin(x) = \\sin(\\omega t)$, where $s \\in [-1, 1]$. Using the triple-angle identity for sine, $\\sin(3x) = 3\\sin(x) - 4\\sin^3(x)$, we can rewrite $v_a^{*}(t)$ as a function of $s$:\n$$g(s) = m s + k (3s - 4s^3) = (m+3k)s - 4ks^3$$\nWe need to find the extrema of $g(s)$ for $s \\in [-1, 1]$. The extrema can occur at the boundaries of the interval ($s = \\pm 1$) or at critical points within the interval where the derivative is zero.\n\nThe derivative of $g(s)$ with respect to $s$ is:\n$$g'(s) = \\frac{d}{ds} \\left( (m+3k)s - 4ks^3 \\right) = m+3k - 12ks^2$$\nSetting the derivative to zero to find critical points $s_c$:\n$$m+3k - 12ks_c^2 = 0 \\implies s_c^2 = \\frac{m+3k}{12k}$$\nFor these critical points to be real and within the interval $s \\in [-1, 1]$, we must have $0 \\leq s_c^2 \\leq 1$.\nSince $m \\geq 0$ and $k > 0$, $m+3k > 0$, so $s_c^2 > 0$ is always satisfied.\nThe condition $s_c^2 \\leq 1$ implies:\n$$\\frac{m+3k}{12k} \\leq 1 \\implies m+3k \\leq 12k \\implies m \\leq 9k$$\n\nWe must analyze two cases based on this condition.\n\nCase 1: $0 \\leq m \\leq 9k$.\nIn this case, the critical points $s_c = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{m+3k}{12k}}$ are within the interval $[-1, 1]$. The possible extrema are the values of $g(s)$ at these critical points and at the boundaries $s = \\pm 1$.\nValue at the critical points:\n$$g(s_c) = (m+3k)s_c - 4ks_c^3 = s_c \\left( (m+3k) - 4ks_c^2 \\right)$$\n$$g(s_c) = s_c \\left( (m+3k) - 4k \\frac{m+3k}{12k} \\right) = s_c \\left( (m+3k) - \\frac{m+3k}{3} \\right) = \\frac{2}{3}(m+3k)s_c$$\nSubstituting $s_c = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{m+3k}{12k}}$:\n$$g(s_c) = \\pm \\frac{2}{3}(m+3k) \\sqrt{\\frac{m+3k}{12k}} = \\pm \\frac{2(m+3k)^{3/2}}{3\\sqrt{12k}} = \\pm \\frac{2(m+3k)^{3/2}}{3 \\cdot 2\\sqrt{3k}} = \\pm \\frac{(m+3k)^{3/2}}{3\\sqrt{3k}}$$\nValue at the boundaries:\n$$g(1) = (m+3k) - 4k = m-k$$\n$$g(-1) = -(m+3k) + 4k = -m+k = -(m-k)$$\nTo determine the global maximum for this case, we compare $|m-k|$ with $\\frac{(m+3k)^{3/2}}{3\\sqrt{3k}}$. Let's compare their squares:\n$$(m-k)^2 \\quad \\text{vs.} \\quad \\left(\\frac{(m+3k)^{3/2}}{3\\sqrt{3k}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{(m+3k)^3}{27k}$$\nConsider the difference:\n$$\\frac{(m+3k)^3}{27k} - (m-k)^2 = \\frac{1}{27k} \\left[ (m+3k)^3 - 27k(m-k)^2 \\right]$$\nThe term in the bracket is:\n$$(m^3 + 9km^2 + 27k^2m + 27k^3) - 27k(m^2 - 2mk + k^2) = m^3 - 18km^2 + 81k^2m = m(m^2 - 18km + 81k^2) = m(m-9k)^2$$\nSince $m \\ge 0$ and $(m-9k)^2 \\ge 0$, this difference is non-negative. Thus, for $0 \\leq m \\leq 9k$:\n$$\\frac{(m+3k)^{3/2}}{3\\sqrt{3k}} \\geq |m-k|$$\nThe equality holds for $m=0$ and $m=9k$.\nTherefore, for $0 \\leq m \\leq 9k$, the extrema are $\\pm \\frac{(m+3k)^{3/2}}{3\\sqrt{3k}}$.\n\nCase 2: $m > 9k$.\nIn this case, $s_c^2 = \\frac{m+3k}{12k} > 1$, so the critical points lie outside the interval $[-1, 1]$. The function $g(s)$ is monotonic on $[-1, 1]$ since its derivative $g'(s) = m+3k - 12ks^2$ does not change sign on $(-1, 1)$. The extrema must therefore occur at the boundaries $s = \\pm 1$.\nThe values are $g(1) = m-k$ and $g(-1) = k-m$.\nSince $m > 9k > k$, $m-k$ is positive, so the maximum is $m-k$ and the minimum is $k-m$.\n\nCombining both cases, we obtain the closed-form expressions for the maximum and minimum of $v_a^*(t)$:\n$$\\max_{t} v_a^{*}(t) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{(m+3k)^{3/2}}{3\\sqrt{3k}} & \\text{if } 0 \\le m \\le 9k \\\\ m-k & \\text{if } m > 9k \\end{cases}$$\n$$\\min_{t} v_a^{*}(t) = -\\max_{t} v_a^{*}(t) = \\begin{cases} -\\frac{(m+3k)^{3/2}}{3\\sqrt{3k}} & \\text{if } 0 \\le m \\le 9k \\\\ k-m & \\text{if } m > 9k \\end{cases}$$\n\nNow we find the largest admissible amplitude $m_{max}(k)$ by setting the peak absolute value to $1$.\nLet $V_{peak}(m, k) = \\max_{t} |v_a^*(t)| = \\max_{t} v_a^{*}(t)$. We solve $V_{peak}(m, k) = 1$ for $m$.\n\nWe evaluate the peak voltage at the transition point $m=9k$:\n$V_{peak}(9k, k) = 9k-k = 8k$.\nWe can distinguish two scenarios based on whether this transition value is less than or greater than $1$.\n\nScenario A: The solution $m_{max}$ satisfies $m_{max} > 9k$.\nThis happens if $V_{peak}(9k, k) < 1$, which means $8k < 1$, or $k < 1/8$.\nIn this regime, we solve $m_{max} - k = 1$, which yields $m_{max} = 1+k$.\nThis solution is consistent, as $m_{max} = 1+k > 9k \\iff 1 > 8k \\iff k < 1/8$.\nSo, for $0 < k < 1/8$, the maximum amplitude is $m_{max}(k) = 1+k$.\n\nScenario B: The solution $m_{max}$ satisfies $0 \\le m_{max} \\le 9k$.\nThis happens if $V_{peak}(9k, k) \\ge 1$, which means $8k \\ge 1$, or $k \\ge 1/8$.\nIn this regime, we solve $\\frac{(m_{max}+3k)^{3/2}}{3\\sqrt{3k}} = 1$.\n$$(m_{max}+3k)^{3/2} = 3\\sqrt{3k} = (27k)^{1/2}$$\nRaising both sides to the power of $2/3$:\n$$m_{max}+3k = \\left((27k)^{1/2}\\right)^{2/3} = (27k)^{1/3} = 3k^{1/3}$$\n$$m_{max} = 3k^{1/3} - 3k$$\nThis solution is consistent if it satisfies $0 \\le m_{max} \\le 9k$.\n$m_{max} \\le 9k \\implies 3k^{1/3} - 3k \\le 9k \\implies 3k^{1/3} \\le 12k \\implies k^{1/3} \\le 4k \\implies k \\le 64k^3 \\implies 1 \\le 64k^2 \\implies k^2 \\ge 1/64 \\implies k \\ge 1/8$.\n$m_{max} \\ge 0 \\implies 3k^{1/3} - 3k \\ge 0 \\implies k^{1/3} \\ge k \\implies k \\ge k^3 \\implies 1 \\ge k^2 \\implies k \\le 1$.\nSo, for $1/8 \\le k \\le 1$, the maximum amplitude is $m_{max}(k) = 3k^{1/3} - 3k$. For $k>1$, $m_{max}$ would be negative, meaning no positive $m$ can satisfy the constraint.\n\nCombining these results, we get the final expression for $m_{max}(k)$, which is a single, piecewise-analytic function:\n$$m_{max}(k) = \\begin{cases} 1+k & \\text{if } 0 < k < \\frac{1}{8} \\\\ 3k^{1/3} - 3k & \\text{if } k \\ge \\frac{1}{8} \\end{cases}$$\nThe problem implies that a physically meaningful solution for $m>0$ exists, which requires $k \\le 1$. The expression holds for $k \\ge 1/8$.",

To prevent this, the integrator dynamics are corrected by feeding back the difference between the applied control and the unsaturated command.

Given $\\beta$ and $M_{\\text{lim}}$, compute $S(\\beta)$ via candidate evaluation described above, then $U_{\\max} = M_{\\text{lim}}/S(\\beta)$.\n2. Compute $u_k^{\\text{unsat}} = K_p e_k + i_k$.\n3. Saturate: $u_k^{\\text{sat}} = \\operatorname{clip}\\left(u_k^{\\text{unsat}}, -U_{\\max}, U_{\\max}\\right)$.\n4. Flag: $s_k = 1$ if $u_k^{\\text{unsat}} \\ne u_k^{\\text{sat}}$ else $0$.\n5. Update integrator: $i_{k+1} = i_k + K_i T_s e_k + K_{\\text{aw}}\\left(u_k^{\\text{sat}} - u_k^{\\text{unsat}}\\right)$.\n\nThis procedure is applied independently to each test case. The final program outputs a single line containing the list of results $[U_{\\max}, s_k, u_k^{\\text{sat}}, i_{k+1}]$ for all test cases in the specified format. All angles are in radians. All quantities are dimensionless and normalized, so no physical units are required in the output.",
