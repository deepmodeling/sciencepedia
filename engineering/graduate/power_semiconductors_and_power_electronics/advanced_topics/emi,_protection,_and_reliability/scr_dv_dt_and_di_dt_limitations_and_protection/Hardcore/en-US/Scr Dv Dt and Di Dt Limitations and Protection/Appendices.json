            "problem": "A Silicon-Controlled Rectifier (SCR) is in its off-state with junction $J_{2}$ reverse-biased. When the anode-to-cathode voltage $V_{AK}(t)$ experiences a rapid increase, the displacement current through the reverse-biased junction capacitance $C_{J2}$ can couple into the gate-cathode path and potentially trigger the device. Consider a device with $C_{J2} = 300\\,\\text{pF}$ measured at the relevant off-state bias and a minimum gate trigger current $I_{GT} = 50\\,\\text{mA}$ at a specified reference condition.

            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It describes the physical mechanism of dv/dt triggering in a Silicon-Controlled Rectifier (SCR) using a standard simplified model. The provided data are complete, consistent, and physically realistic. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the critical rate of rise of anode-cathode voltage, $\\left(\\mathrm{d}V_{AK}/\\mathrm{d}t\\right)_{\\text{crit}}$, that causes spurious turn-on of an SCR, a numerical evaluation of this rate, and a qualitative discussion of influencing factors.\n\nThe physical mechanism for $dv/dt$ turn-on is the displacement current flowing through the capacitance of the reverse-biased central junction, $J_2$. In the off-state, nearly the entire anode-to-cathode voltage, $V_{AK}$, is dropped across this junction. The junction capacitance is given as $C_{J2}$. A time-varying anode-cathode voltage, $V_{AK}(t)$, will thus cause a displacement current, $i_{C}(t)$, to flow through this capacitance.\n\nAccording to the constitutive relation for a capacitor, this current is given by:\n$$i_{C}(t) = C_{J2} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{J2}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}$$\nwhere $V_{J2}(t)$ is the voltage across the junction $J_2$. Since we approximate that the entire anode-cathode voltage appears across this junction, we can write $V_{J2}(t) \\approx V_{AK}(t)$. Therefore, the displacement current is:\n$$i_{C}(t) = C_{J2} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{AK}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}$$\n\nThe problem states that a fraction, $\\alpha$, of this displacement current is coupled into the gate-cathode circuit, acting as an effective gate current, $I_{G,eff}(t)$. This is consistent with the internal structure of the SCR, where the displacement current flows into the p-base region and can provide the base current for the internal npn transistor section, equivalent to an external gate current. The external gate terminal is open, which represents the worst-case scenario as no current is shunted away externally.\nThe effective gate current is thus:\n$$I_{G,eff}(t) = \\alpha \\cdot i_{C}(t)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $i_{C}(t)$, we get:\n$$I_{G,eff}(t) = \\alpha C_{J2} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{AK}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}$$\n\nSpurious turn-on occurs when this effective gate current reaches the minimum DC gate current required to trigger the device, $I_{GT}$. The critical rate of rise of voltage, denoted as $\\left(\\mathrm{d}V_{AK}/\\mathrm{d}t\\right)_{\\text{crit}}$, is the rate that produces exactly this trigger current. We set $I_{G,eff} = I_{GT}$ and $\\mathrm{d}V_{AK}/\\mathrm{d}t = \\left(\\mathrm{d}V_{AK}/\\mathrm{d}t\\right)_{\\text{crit}}$ to find this critical value:\n$$I_{GT} = \\alpha C_{J2} \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{AK}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\right)_{\\text{crit}}$$\nSolving for the critical rate of rise of voltage, we obtain the desired expression:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{AK}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\right)_{\\text{crit}} = \\frac{I_{GT}}{\\alpha C_{J2}}$$\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically using the given parameters:\n- Minimum gate trigger current, $I_{GT} = 50\\,\\text{mA} = 50 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{A}$.\n- Junction capacitance, $C_{J2} = 300\\,\\text{pF} = 300 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{F}$.\n- Effective coupling factor, $\\alpha = 0.2$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{AK}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\right)_{\\text{crit}} = \\frac{50 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{A}}{0.2 \\times (300 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{F})}$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{AK}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\right)_{\\text{crit}} = \\frac{50 \\times 10^{-3}}{60 \\times 10^{-12}}\\,\\frac{\\text{V}}{\\text{s}}$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{AK}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\right)_{\\text{crit}} = \\frac{5}{6} \\times 10^{9}\\,\\frac{\\text{V}}{\\text{s}} \\approx 0.8333... \\times 10^{9}\\,\\frac{\\text{V}}{\\text{s}}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer in units of $\\text{V}/\\mu\\text{s}$. We use the conversion $1\\,\\text{s} = 10^6\\,\\mu\\text{s}$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{AK}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\right)_{\\text{crit}} = (0.8333... \\times 10^{9}\\,\\text{V/s}) \\times (10^{-6}\\,\\text{s}/\\mu\\text{s})$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{AK}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\right)_{\\text{crit}} = 0.8333... \\times 10^{3}\\,\\frac{\\text{V}}{\\mu\\text{s}} = 833.333... \\,\\frac{\\text{V}}{\\mu\\text{s}}$$\nRounding the numerical result to three significant figures, we get $833\\,\\text{V}/\\mu\\text{s}$.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for an explanation of how other conditions affect this estimate.\n\n1.  **Junction Temperature ($T_j$):** An increase in $T_j$ significantly lowers the $dv/dt$ capability. This is primarily because the minimum gate trigger current, $I_{GT}$, decreases as temperature rises. Furthermore, leakage currents across the junctions increase with temperature, making the device more sensitive to triggering. As seen from the formula $\\left(\\mathrm{d}V_{AK}/\\mathrm{d}t\\right)_{\\text{crit}} = I_{GT}/(\\alpha C_{J2})$, a smaller $I_{GT}$ directly results in a lower critical $dv/dt$. Datasheets typically specify the $dv/dt$ rating at the maximum operating junction temperature, as this is the worst-case condition.\n\n2.  **Gate-Cathode Shunt Resistance ($R_{GK}$):** The analysis assumed the gate was open. If an external resistor, $R_{GK}$, is connected between the gate and cathode terminals, it provides an alternative path for the displacement current. The current $I_{G,eff}$ now splits between the internal gate-cathode junction and this external resistor. A smaller $R_{GK}$ shunts a larger portion of the current away from the gate-triggering mechanism, effectively requiring a larger displacement current (and thus a higher $dv/dt$) to turn the SCR on. Therefore, adding a shunt resistor $R_{GK}$ improves (increases) the $dv/dt$ rating of the device.\n\n3.  **Voltage Dependence of $C_{J2}$:** The junction capacitance $C_{J2}$ is not a constant value; it decreases as the reverse-bias voltage across the junction increases. The relationship is typically of the form $C_{J2} \\propto (V_{J2})^{-n}$, where $n$ is between $1/3$ and $1/2$. The calculation used a single, constant value for $C_{J2}$, which is a simplification. A more precise analysis would recognize that the displacement current $i_C = \\mathrm{d}Q/\\mathrm{d}t = \\mathrm{d}(C_{J2}V_{J2})/\\mathrm{d}t = C_{J2}(\\mathrm{d}V_{J2}/\\mathrm{d}t) + V_{J2}(\\mathrm{d}C_{J2}/\\mathrm{d}t)$ is more complex. Since capacitance is highest at low voltages, the initial part of the voltage rise contributes most significantly to the total charge transferred. Using a constant capacitance measured at a specific bias is an engineering approximation. The standard test method often specifies a linear voltage ramp up to $67\\%$ of the breakdown voltage $V_{DRM}$ to provide a standardized, repeatable measurement that implicitly accounts for this non-linearity.\n\n4.  **Waveform Shape of $V_{AK}(t)$:** The calculation assumes a constant $\\mathrm{d}V_{AK}/\\mathrm{d}t$, which corresponds to a linear voltage ramp. If the voltage rises exponentially, such as $V_{AK}(t) = V_f (1 - \\exp(-t/\\tau))$, the rate of rise $\\mathrm{d}V_{AK}/\\mathrm{d}t = (V_f/\\tau)\\exp(-t/\\tau)$ is maximum at $t=0$ and decreases thereafter. Triggering would depend on this peak instantaneous value. The linear ramp is a standardized test waveform because it maintains the rate of rise for the duration of the voltage swing (up to the test voltage), which is generally a more severe condition than an exponential rise with the same initial slope, especially when the voltage-dependent capacitance is considered. Therefore, datasheet ratings are typically specified for a linear ramp.",

It is a canonical problem in the analysis of power semiconductor devices.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis begins with the two-transistor model of the SCR. Let $T_p$ be the $pnp$ transistor and $T_n$ be the $npn$ transistor. The anode (A) is the emitter of $T_p$, and the cathode (K) is the emitter of $T_n$. The collector of $T_p$, $i_{Cp}$, is connected to the base of $T_n$, $i_{Bn}$. The collector of $T_n$, $i_{Cn}$, is connected to the base of $T_p$, $i_{Bp}$. The external gate terminal is at the base of $T_n$ and is open-circuited.\n\nThe junction capacitance $C_{J2}$ is connected between the anode (A) and the internal gate node, which is the base of $T_n$. A changing anode voltage $v_a(t)$ induces a displacement current $i_{J2}(t)$ through this capacitor.\n\nWe define the currents according to standard BJT notation. The problem defines the effective gate current, $i_{g,\\mathrm{eff}}(t)$, as the total base current entering the $npn$ gate region. From the model, this is $i_{Bn}(t)$.\n$$i_{g,\\mathrm{eff}}(t) = i_{Bn}(t)$$\nApplying Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at the base node of the $npn$ transistor ($T_n$), the total current entering the node is the sum of the collector current from $T_p$ and the displacement current from $C_{J2}$. This current becomes the base current for $T_n$.\n$$i_{Bn}(t) = i_{Cp}(t) + i_{J2}(t)$$\nAt the base node of the $pnp$ transistor ($T_p$), the base current is supplied by the collector of $T_n$. As the external gate is open, there are no other paths.\n$$i_{Bp}(t) = i_{Cn}(t)$$\nUsing the small-signal BJT current gain relation, $i_c = \\beta i_b$, we have:\n$$i_{Cp}(t) = \\beta_p i_{Bp}(t)$$\n$$i_{Cn}(t) = \\beta_n i_{Bn}(t)$$\nNow, we substitute these relations to find an expression for $i_{Bn}(t)$ in terms of $i_{J2}(t)$.\nFirst, substitute $i_{Cp}(t)$ into the KCL equation for the $T_n$ base:\n$$i_{Bn}(t) = \\beta_p i_{Bp}(t) + i_{J2}(t)$$\nNext, substitute $i_{Bp}(t) = i_{Cn}(t)$:\n$$i_{Bn}(t) = \\beta_p i_{Cn}(t) + i_{J2}(t)$$\nFinally, substitute $i_{Cn}(t) = \\beta_n i_{Bn}(t)$:\n$$i_{Bn}(t) = \\beta_p (\\beta_n i_{Bn}(t)) + i_{J2}(t)$$\nThis equation describes the regenerative feedback loop. We can now solve for $i_{Bn}(t)$:\n$$i_{Bn}(t) - \\beta_p \\beta_n i_{Bn}(t) = i_{J2}(t)$$\n$$i_{Bn}(t) (1 - \\beta_p \\beta_n) = i_{J2}(t)$$\n$$i_{Bn}(t) = \\frac{i_{J2}(t)}{1 - \\beta_p \\beta_n}$$\nSince we defined $i_{g,\\mathrm{eff}}(t) = i_{Bn}(t)$, we have:\n$$i_{g,\\mathrm{eff}}(t) = \\frac{i_{J2}(t)}{1 - \\beta_p \\beta_n}$$\nThe displacement current $i_{J2}(t)$ through the capacitor $C_{J2}$ is given by $i_C = C \\frac{dv}{dt}$. The voltage across the capacitor is the difference between the anode voltage $v_a(t)$ and the voltage at the base of $T_n$, $v_{Bn}(t)$.\n$$i_{J2}(t) = C_{J2} \\frac{d}{dt} (v_a(t) - v_{Bn}(t))$$\nIn the forward blocking state, the base-emitter junction of $T_n$ is barely biased, and its voltage $v_{Bn}(t)$ is very small and changes much less rapidly than the anode voltage $v_a(t)$. The problem's simplification to neglect other circuit elements allows us to assume that $\\frac{dv_a}{dt} \\gg \\frac{dv_{Bn}}{dt}$. Thus, we can approximate the capacitor current as:\n$$i_{J2}(t) \\approx C_{J2} \\frac{d v_a(t)}{dt}$$\nTo find the transfer function $H(s)$, we transform our equations to the Laplace domain, where the differentiation operator $\\frac{d}{dt}$ corresponds to multiplication by $s$ (assuming zero initial conditions).\n$$I_{J2}(s) = s C_{J2} V_a(s)$$\n$$I_{g,\\mathrm{eff}}(s) = \\frac{I_{J2}(s)}{1 - \\beta_p \\beta_n}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $I_{J2}(s)$:\n$$I_{g,\\mathrm{eff}}(s) = \\frac{s C_{J2} V_a(s)}{1 - \\beta_p \\beta_n}$$\nThe transfer function $H(s)$ is the ratio of $I_{g,\\mathrm{eff}}(s)$ to $V_a(s)$:\n$$H(s) = \\frac{I_{g,\\mathrm{eff}}(s)}{V_a(s)} = \\frac{s C_{J2}}{1 - \\beta_p \\beta_n}$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we need to find the maximum constant anode voltage slope, which we denote as $\\frac{dv_a}{dt}\\Big|_{\\text{max}}$. A constant slope means $\\frac{dv_a}{dt} = K$, where $K$ is a constant. Under this condition, the displacement current $i_{J2}$ is also a constant (DC) value:\n$$I_{J2} = C_{J2} \\frac{dv_a}{dt}$$\nConsequently, the effective gate current $I_{g,\\mathrm{eff}}$ is also a constant DC value:\n$$I_{g,\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{I_{J2}}{1 - \\beta_p \\beta_n} = \\frac{C_{J2}}{1 - \\beta_p \\beta_n} \\frac{dv_a}{dt}$$\nThe SCR will spuriously trigger if this effective gate current reaches the critical value $I_{GT}$. The $dv/dt$ immunity margin is the maximum slope $\\frac{dv_a}{dt}$ that keeps $I_{g,\\mathrm{eff}}$ just below or equal to $I_{GT}$. We set $I_{g,\\mathrm{eff}} = I_{GT}$ and solve for this maximum slope:\n$$I_{GT} = \\frac{C_{J2}}{1 - \\beta_p \\beta_n} \\frac{dv_a}{dt}\\Big|_{\\text{max}}$$\nSolving for $\\frac{dv_a}{dt}\\Big|_{\\text{max}}$:\n$$\\frac{dv_a}{dt}\\Big|_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{I_{GT} (1 - \\beta_p \\beta_n)}{C_{J2}}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n-   $I_{GT} = 19 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{A}$\n-   $\\beta_p = 0.33$\n-   $\\beta_n = 0.42$\n-   $C_{J2} = 147 \\times 10^{-12} \\mathrm{F}$\n\nFirst, calculate the regenerative factor term:\n$$1 - \\beta_p \\beta_n = 1 - (0.33)(0.42) = 1 - 0.1386 = 0.8614$$\nNow, substitute this into the expression for the maximum slope:\n$$\\frac{dv_a}{dt}\\Big|_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{(19 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{A}) (0.8614)}{147 \\times 10^{-12} \\mathrm{F}}$$\n$$\\frac{dv_a}{dt}\\Big|_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{1.63666 \\times 10^{-2}}{147 \\times 10^{-12}} \\frac{\\mathrm{A \\cdot F^{-1}}}{\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{1.63666}{147} \\times 10^{10} \\mathrm{V/s}$$\n$$\\frac{dv_a}{dt}\\Big|_{\\text{max}} \\approx 0.01113374 \\times 10^{10} \\mathrm{V/s} = 1.113374 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{V/s}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be in units of volts per microsecond ($\\mathrm{V/\\mu s}$).

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in established principles of semiconductor physics, well-posed with a complete and consistent set of definitions and parameters, and objective in its formulation. All conditions for a valid problem are met. The following is a complete and reasoned solution.\n\nThe primary objective is to compute the temperature-dependent withstand capabilities of a Silicon Controlled Rectifier (SCR) concerning the rate of rise of off-state voltage, $\\left(dv/dt\\right)$, and on-state current, $\\left(di/dt\\right)$. The analysis is performed at two distinct junction temperatures, $T_{25} = 25^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ and $T_{125} = 125^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$, which correspond to $T_{25} = 298.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$ and $T_{125} = 398.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$ in the absolute temperature scale required for physics-based calculations.\n\n**1. Formulation of Temperature-Dependent Models**\n\nThe problem provides a set of simplified, yet physically consistent, models for the parameters that govern SCR performance. All calculations will be performed in SI units. The fundamental constants used are the Boltzmann constant, $k_B = 1.380649\\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{K}$, and the elementary charge, $q = 1.602176634\\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$. The reference temperature for parameter definitions is $T_0 = 298.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\n**1.1. $dv/dt$ Capability Model**\n\nThe critical rate of rise of off-state voltage, or $dv/dt$ capability, is determined by the false triggering mechanism. A rapidly rising voltage across the SCR induces a displacement current $i_C = C(T)\\frac{dv}{dt}$ through the device's internal junction capacitance, $C(T)$. A fraction of this current, $k_c$, can act as a gate current. If this parasitic gate current reaches the gate trigger current, $I_{gt}(T)$, the device will spuriously turn on. The threshold is therefore given by:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{dv}{dt}\\right)_{\\text{cap}}(T) = \\frac{I_{gt}(T)}{k_c\\,C(T)}\n$$\nThe temperature dependencies of the constituent parameters are given as:\n- Gate Trigger Current: $I_{gt}(T) = I_{gt0}\\left(\\frac{T_0}{T}\\right)^r$. This model reflects that the internal bipolar junction transistor structures within the SCR have higher gain at elevated temperatures, thus requiring less current to trigger.\n- Effective Capacitance: $C(T) = C_0\\left(1 + \\beta_C\\,(T - T_0)\\right)$. The junction capacitance exhibits a slight positive temperature dependence.\n\nSubstituting these into the capability equation yields the full expression for $dv/dt$ capability:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{dv}{dt}\\right)_{\\text{cap}}(T) = \\frac{I_{gt0}\\left(\\frac{T_0}{T}\\right)^r}{k_c\\,C_0\\left(1 + \\beta_C\\,(T - T_0)\\right)}\n$$\nThe result from this equation is in units of $\\mathrm{V}/\\mathrm{s}$. To report it in $\\mathrm{V}/\\mu\\mathrm{s}$, the value must be divided by $10^6$.\n\n**1.2. $di/dt$ Capability Model**\n\nThe critical rate of rise of on-state current, or $di/dt$ capability, is limited by the finite velocity at which the conducting plasma spreads across the silicon die area from the initial turn-on region near the gate. If the current rises too quickly, the current density in the small, initially conducting area becomes excessive, leading to localized overheating and device failure. The $di/dt$ capability is modeled as the product of the maximum allowable current density $J_{\\lim}(T)$, the effective perimeter of the spreading front $P_0$, and the spreading velocity $v_{\\text{sp}}(T)$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{di}{dt}\\right)_{\\text{cap}}(T) = J_{\\lim}(T)\\,P_0\\,v_{\\text{sp}}(T)\n$$\nThe spreading velocity is modeled as a diffusion-limited process:\n$$\nv_{\\text{sp}}(T) = \\gamma \\sqrt{\\frac{D_a(T)}{\\tau(T)}}\n$$\nwhere $D_a(T)$ is the ambipolar diffusion coefficient and $\\tau(T)$ is the high-level carrier lifetime. The ambipolar diffusion coefficient is related to the ambipolar mobility $\\mu(T)$ and the thermal voltage $V_T(T)$ via the Einstein relation:\n$$\nD_a(T) = \\mu(T)\\,V_T(T) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad V_T(T) = \\frac{k_B\\,T}{q}\n$$\nThe temperature dependencies of the underlying parameters are:\n- Ambipolar Mobility: $\\mu(T) = \\mu_0 \\left(\\frac{T_0}{T}\\right)^m$. Mobility decreases with temperature due to increased lattice scattering.\n- Carrier Lifetime: $\\tau(T) = \\tau_0 \\left(\\frac{T}{T_0}\\right)^p$. Lifetime typically increases with temperature.\n- Maximum Current Density: $J_{\\lim}(T) = J_0 \\left(\\frac{T_0}{T}\\right)^s$. The safe operational current density decreases at higher temperatures to manage thermal stress.\n\nBy substituting these relations, we can construct the full temperature-dependent expression for the $di/dt$ capability. The calculation proceeds in the following steps for a given temperature $T$:\n1. Calculate the thermal voltage: $V_T(T) = \\frac{k_B\\,T}{q}$.\n2. Calculate the temperature-dependent mobility: $\\mu(T) = \\mu_0 \\left(\\frac{T_0}{T}\\right)^m$.\n3. Calculate the ambipolar diffusion coefficient: $D_a(T) = \\mu(T) V_T(T)$.\n4. Calculate the temperature-dependent lifetime: $\\tau(T) = \\tau_0 \\left(\\frac{T}{T_0}\\right)^p$.\n5. Calculate the spreading velocity: $v_{\\text{sp}}(T) = \\gamma \\sqrt{\\frac{D_a(T)}{\\tau(T)}}$.\n6. Calculate the temperature-dependent current density limit: $J_{\\lim}(T) = J_0 \\left(\\frac{T_0}{T}\\right)^s$.\n7. Finally, calculate the $di/dt$ capability: $\\left(\\frac{di}{dt}\\right)_{\\text{cap}}(T) = J_{\\lim}(T)\\,P_0\\,v_{\\text{sp}}(T)$.\n\nThe result from this calculation is in units of $\\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{s}$. To report it in $\\mathrm{A}/\\mu\\mathrm{s}$, the value must be divided by $10^6$.\n\n**2. Computational Procedure and Trend Analysis**\n\nFor each of the three provided test cases, the above formulas are evaluated at $T_{25} = 298.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$ and $T_{125} = 398.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$. The parameters for each test case are:\n- Case $1$: $\\left(I_{gt0}, k_c, C_0, \\beta_C, \\mu_0, m, \\tau_0, p, \\gamma, P_0, J_0, s, r\\right) = \\left(0.05, 0.04, 3\\times 10^{-9}, 0.001, 0.05, 1.5, 2\\times 10^{-7}, 0.8, 0.6, 0.1, 2\\times 10^{7}, 0.5, 0.3\\right)$.\n- Case $2$: $\\left(0.05, 0.04, 12\\times 10^{-9}, 0.0012, 0.05, 1.5, 2.5\\times 10^{-7}, 0.8, 0.6, 0.1, 2\\times 10^{7}, 0.5, 0.3\\right)$.\n- Case $3$: $\\left(0.04, 0.015, 3\\times 10^{-9}, 0.0008, 0.045, 1.6, 2\\times 10^{-7}, 0.9, 0.55, 0.06, 1.6\\times 10^{7}, 0.6, 0.25\\right)$.\n\nAfter computing the four capability values for each case ($dv/dt$ at $T_{25}, T_{125}$ and $di/dt$ at $T_{25}, T_{125}$), a trend analysis is performed. A boolean value is generated to indicate whether the capability decreases at the higher temperature, which is the behavior typically observed in practice. This is evaluated by the logical conditions:\n- $dv/dt$ trend: $\\left(\\frac{dv}{dt}\\right)_{\\text{cap}}(T_{125})  \\left(\\frac{dv}{dt}\\right)_{\\text{cap}}(T_{25})$\n- $di/dt$ trend: $\\left(\\frac{di}{dt}\\right)_{\\text{cap}}(T_{125})  \\left(\\frac{di}{dt}\\right)_{\\text{cap}}(T_{25})$\n\nThe final numerical results for the capabilities are rounded to two decimal places. The implementation of this procedure is provided in the final answer.",
