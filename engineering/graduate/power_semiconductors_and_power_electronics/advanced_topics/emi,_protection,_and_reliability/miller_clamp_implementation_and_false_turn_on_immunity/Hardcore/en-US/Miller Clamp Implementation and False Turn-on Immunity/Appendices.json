Let $v_{g}(t)$ be the gate-to-source voltage. The injected Miller current $i_{M}(t)$ splits into two paths: the current through the capacitor $C_{gs}$, denoted $i_{C}(t)$, and the current through the series RL branch, denoted $i_{RL}(t)$.\n\nApplying Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL) at the gate node:\n$$i_{M}(t) = i_{C}(t) + i_{RL}(t)$$\nThe current through the capacitor is given by:\n$$i_{C}(t) = C_{gs} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{g}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}$$\nSubstituting this into the KCL equation:\n$$i_{M}(t) = C_{gs} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{g}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} + i_{RL}(t)$$\n\nNext, applying Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL) to the series RL branch, the voltage across it is $v_{g}(t)$:\n$$v_{g}(t) = R \\, i_{RL}(t) + L_{g} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}i_{RL}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}$$\n\nTo derive a single differential equation for $v_g(t)$, we must eliminate $i_{RL}(t)$. From the KCL equation, we express $i_{RL}(t)$ in terms of $v_g(t)$ and $i_M(t)$:\n$$i_{RL}(t) = i_{M}(t) - C_{gs} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{g}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}$$\nDifferentiating this expression with respect to time gives:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}i_{RL}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}i_{M}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} - C_{gs} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2v_{g}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t^2}$$\nSubstituting these two expressions for $i_{RL}(t)$ and its derivative into the KVL equation:\n$$v_{g}(t) = R \\left( i_{M}(t) - C_{gs} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{g}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\right) + L_{g} \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{d}i_{M}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} - C_{gs} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2v_{g}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} \\right)$$\nRearranging the terms to group the derivatives of $v_g(t)$ on the left side:\n$$L_{g}C_{gs} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2v_{g}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} + R C_{gs} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{g}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} + v_{g}(t) = L_{g} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}i_{M}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} + R \\, i_{M}(t)$$\nThe problem asks for the homogeneous differential equation, which describes the source-free network ($i_{M}(t) = 0$). Setting the right-hand side to zero, we obtain:\n$$L_{g}C_{gs} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2v_{g}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} + R C_{gs} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{g}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} + v_{g}(t) = 0$$\nTo identify the natural frequency and damping ratio, we divide by $L_{g}C_{gs}$ to put the equation in the standard canonical form of a second-order linear system, $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2x}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} + 2\\zeta\\omega_{n}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\omega_{n}^2 x = 0$:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2v_{g}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} + \\frac{R}{L_{g}} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{g}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{1}{L_{g}C_{gs}} v_{g}(t) = 0$$\nBy comparing the coefficients with the canonical form, we can identify $\\omega_{n}$ and $\\zeta$:\n$$\\omega_{n}^2 = \\frac{1}{L_{g}C_{gs}} \\implies \\omega_{n} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{L_{g}C_{gs}}}$$\n$$2\\zeta\\omega_{n} = \\frac{R}{L_{g}} \\implies \\zeta = \\frac{R}{2L_{g}\\omega_{n}} = \\frac{R}{2L_{g}} \\sqrt{L_{g}C_{gs}} = \\frac{R}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{C_{gs}}{L_{g}}}$$\n\n**2) Calculation of Damped Frequency and Damping Ratio**\n\nFirst, we calculate the constant natural frequency $\\omega_{n}$:\n$$\\omega_{n} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(10 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{H})(4.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{F})}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\text{s}^2}} = 1.5811 \\times 10^8 \\,\\text{rad/s}$$\nThe damping ratio $\\zeta$ depends on $R = R_{p} + R_{c}$.

A simple quasi-static analysis might only consider the DC resistance $R$ of the gate path, predicting a voltage of $v_{g,qs} = i_{M} R$. For the unclamped case ($R = 0.50\\,\\Omega$), the injected current is $i_M = C_{gd} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{ds}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = (30 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{F})(50 \\times 10^9\\,\\text{V/s}) = 1.5\\,\\text{A}$. This would suggest a voltage of $v_{g,qs} = (1.5\\,\\text{A})(0.50\\,\\Omega) = 0.75\\,\\text{V}$, which is well below $V_{th} = 3.5\\,\\text{V}$.\n\nHowever, this quasi-static view is incomplete. The gate network is a resonant RLC circuit. A fast-rising drain voltage induces a sharp pulse of Miller current $i_M(t)$, which acts as a high-frequency stimulus. For an underdamped system ($\\zeta  1$), the response to such a stimulus is an oscillation (ringing) superimposed on the steady-state response. This ringing is due to the exchange of energy between the capacitive element ($C_{gs}$) and the inductive element ($L_g$). The initial surge of current stores energy in these reactive components. The system's response to this sudden injection of energy is to oscillate, and the first peak of this oscillation significantly overshoots the final steady-state value. The magnitude of the overshoot is a direct function of the damping ratio $\\zeta$; lower damping leads to higher overshoot. Consequently, even if the quasi-static voltage $i_M R$ is below $V_{th}$, the peak of the first voltage ring, $v_{g,\\text{peak}}$, can easily surpass $V_{th}$, causing an unintended and potentially destructive turn-on of the MOSFET.\n\n**4) Determination of Minimum Clamp Resistance $R_{c,\\min}$**\n\nTo eliminate overshoot-driven threshold crossings within this linear model, the system must be at least critically damped. An oscillatory response with overshoot is characteristic only of underdamped systems ($\\zeta  1$). The condition for critical damping is $\\zeta = 1$. For any $\\zeta \\ge 1$, the response will be non-oscillatory, and for a step-like input, there will be no overshoot. Therefore, we must find the minimum clamp resistance $R_{c,\\min}$ that results in $\\zeta = 1$.\n\nThe condition on the total resistance $R$ is:\n$$\\zeta = \\frac{R}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{C_{gs}}{L_{g}}} = 1$$\nSolving for the required total resistance, $R_{crit}$:\n$$R_{crit} = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{L_{g}}{C_{gs}}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$R_{crit} = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{10 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{H}}{4.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{F}}} = 2\\sqrt{2.5} \\approx 3.162\\,\\Omega$$\nThis is the total resistance required in the gate loop for critical damping. This total resistance is the sum of the parasitic resistance $R_p$ and the added clamp resistance $R_c$.\n$$R_{crit} = R_{p} + R_{c,\\min}$$\nSolving for the minimum clamp resistance $R_{c,\\min}$:\n$$R_{c,\\min} = R_{crit} - R_{p}$$\n$$R_{c,\\min} = 3.162\\,\\Omega - 0.50\\,\\Omega = 2.662\\,\\Omega$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get $R_{c,\\min} = 2.66\\,\\Omega$.",

The physical scenario described is a standard method for characterizing power semiconductor devices, and the numerical values are realistic for modern Silicon Carbide (SiC) technology. The problem describes a turn-on event, where the gate-source voltage is held constant at the Miller plateau while the drain-source voltage falls. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe solution is presented in two parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Extraction Method\n\nThe fundamental relationship between charge $Q$, voltage $V$, and current $i$ for a capacitor is given by $i = \\frac{dQ}{dt}$. For a non-linear capacitor, where the capacitance $C$ is a function of the voltage across it, the capacitance is defined as the differential capacitance $C(V) = \\frac{dQ}{dV}$. Using the chain rule, the current can be expressed as:\n$$i = \\frac{dQ}{dt} = \\frac{dQ}{dV} \\frac{dV}{dt} = C(V) \\frac{dV}{dt}$$\n\nWe apply this principle to the gate node of the MOSFET. By Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL), the total current flowing into the gate terminal from the driver, $i_g$, must be equal to the sum of the currents flowing into the parasitic capacitances connected to the gate. The problem states that contributions other than the gate-to-drain displacement current are negligible. However, a rigorous derivation should start from a more complete model and apply the simplifying assumptions. The primary currents are the one through the gate-to-source capacitance, $i_{C_{gs}}$, and the one through the gate-to-drain capacitance, $i_{C_{gd}}$.\n\n$$i_g = i_{C_{gs}} + i_{C_{gd}}$$\n\nThe voltages across these capacitances are $V_{gs}$ and $V_{gd} = V_{gs} - V_{ds}$, respectively. The currents are thus:\n$$i_{C_{gs}} = C_{gs}(V_{gs}) \\frac{dV_{gs}}{dt}$$\n$$i_{C_{gd}} = C_{gd}(V_{gd}) \\frac{dV_{gd}}{dt} = C_{gd}(V_{gs} - V_{ds}) \\frac{d(V_{gs} - V_{ds})}{dt}$$\n\nExpanding the derivative for $i_{C_{gd}}$ yields:\n$$i_{C_{gd}} = C_{gd}(V_{gs} - V_{ds}) \\left(\\frac{dV_{gs}}{dt} - \\frac{dV_{ds}}{dt}\\right)$$\n\nSubstituting these into the KCL equation for the gate current gives the full expression:\n$$i_g = C_{gs}(V_{gs}) \\frac{dV_{gs}}{dt} + C_{gd}(V_{gs} - V_{ds}) \\left(\\frac{dV_{gs}}{dt} - \\frac{dV_{ds}}{dt}\\right)$$\n$$i_g = \\left(C_{gs}(V_{gs}) + C_{gd}(V_{gs} - V_{ds})\\right) \\frac{dV_{gs}}{dt} - C_{gd}(V_{gs} - V_{ds}) \\frac{dV_{ds}}{dt}$$\n\nThe measurement is performed during the Miller plateau. This is the defining feature of the switching transition where the gate-to-source voltage $V_{gs}$ remains nearly constant, while the drain-to-source voltage $V_{ds}$ changes rapidly. The problem explicitly states this condition: \"$V_{GS}$ remains approximately constant\" and that the \"Miller clamp in the gate driver is active during the plateau, providing a low impedance path that prevents $V_{GS}$ from rising appreciably\". This allows us to make the critical simplification that $\\frac{dV_{gs}}{dt} \\approx 0$.\n\nApplying this condition to the gate current equation, the first term vanishes:\n$$i_g \\approx -C_{gd}(V_{gs} - V_{ds}) \\frac{dV_{ds}}{dt}$$\nSince $V_{gs}$ is constant during this interval, the voltage dependency of $C_{gd}$ is solely a function of $V_{ds}$. We can therefore write $C_{gd}(V_{ds})$.\n\nThe proposed method for extracting the instantaneous differential capacitance $C_{gd}$ as a function of $V_{ds}$ is to rearrange this simplified equation:\n$$C_{gd}(V_{ds}) = -\\frac{i_g}{\\frac{dV_{ds}}{dt}}$$\n\nThis method allows for the characterization of the $C_{gd}(V_{ds})$ curve by simultaneously measuring the gate current $i_g(t)$ and the drain-source voltage $V_{ds}(t)$ during the Miller plateau. For each point in time $t$ during the plateau, one can compute the derivative $\\frac{dV_{ds}}{dt}$ and use the corresponding values of $i_g(t)$ and $V_{ds}(t)$ to find a single point on the capacitance curve.\n\nThe accuracy of this method is directly contingent on the validity of the assumption $\\frac{dV_{gs}}{dt} \\approx 0$. The action of the gate driver (referred to as a Miller clamp in the problem statement) creating a low-impedance path to the gate is what enforces this condition. By holding $V_{gs}$ constant, it effectively decouples the dynamics of the gate-source capacitance $C_{gs}$, isolating the gate current component that is solely due to the charging/discharging of the gate-drain capacitance $C_{gd}$ in response to the changing $V_{ds}$. The explicit instruction that other parasitic contributions are negligible further ensures that the measured $i_g$ is the current required by the model.\n\nPart 2: Sample Calculation\n\nWe are given the following measured values at a specific instant during the plateau:\n- $V_{DS} = 600\\,\\text{V}$\n- $\\frac{dV_{DS}}{dt} = -26\\,\\text{kV}/\\mu\\text{s}$\n- $i_{g} = +0.52\\,\\text{A}$\n\nFirst, we must convert the given rate of change of voltage into standard SI units (V/s):\n$$\\frac{dV_{DS}}{dt} = -26\\,\\frac{\\text{kV}}{\\mu\\text{s}} = -26 \\times \\frac{10^3\\,\\text{V}}{10^{-6}\\,\\text{s}} = -26 \\times 10^9\\,\\frac{\\text{V}}{\\text{s}}$$\nThe gate current $i_g$ is already in SI units ($0.52\\,\\text{A}$).\n\nNow, we use the derived formula to calculate the capacitance at $V_{DS} = 600\\,\\text{V}$:\n$$C_{gd}(V_{DS} = 600\\,\\text{V}) = -\\frac{i_g}{\\frac{dV_{DS}}{dt}}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$C_{gd}(600\\,\\text{V}) = -\\frac{0.52\\,\\text{A}}{-26 \\times 10^9\\,\\text{V/s}}$$\n$$C_{gd}(600\\,\\text{V}) = \\frac{0.52}{26 \\times 10^9}\\,\\text{F}$$\n$$C_{gd}(600\\,\\text{V}) = \\frac{0.02}{10^9}\\,\\text{F} = 0.02 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{F} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\text{F}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in picofarads (pF), where $1\\,\\text{pF} = 10^{-12}\\,\\text{F}$.\n$$C_{gd}(600\\,\\text{V}) = 2 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\text{F} = 20 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{F} = 20\\,\\text{pF}$$\n\nFinally, we round the result to three significant figures as requested.\n$$C_{gd}(600\\,\\text{V}) = 20.0\\,\\text{pF}$$\nThe signs are physically consistent: a falling drain voltage ($\\frac{dV_{ds}}{dt}  0$) induces a displacement current from drain to gate, which must be sourced by the gate driver, resulting in a positive $i_g$. The calculation correctly yields a positive capacitance.",
