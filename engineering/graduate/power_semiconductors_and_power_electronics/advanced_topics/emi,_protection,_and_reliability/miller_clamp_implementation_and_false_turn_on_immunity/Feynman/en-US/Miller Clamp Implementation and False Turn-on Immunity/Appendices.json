A full solution will be developed.\n\n**1) Derivation of the Homogeneous Differential Equation, $\\omega_{n}$, and $\\zeta$**\n\nWe begin by applying Kirchhoff’s Laws to the specified gate network model. Let $v_{g}(t)$ be the gate-to-source voltage. The injected Miller current $i_{M}(t)$ splits into two paths: the current through the capacitor $C_{gs}$, denoted $i_{C}(t)$, and the current through the series RL branch, denoted $i_{RL}(t)$.\n\nApplying Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL) at the gate node:\n$$i_{M}(t) = i_{C}(t) + i_{RL}(t)$$\nThe current through the capacitor is given by:\n$$i_{C}(t) = C_{gs} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{g}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}$$\nSubstituting this into the KCL equation:\n$$i_{M}(t) = C_{gs} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{g}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} + i_{RL}(t)$$\n\nNext, applying Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL) to the series RL branch, the voltage across it is $v_{g}(t)$:\n$$v_{g}(t) = R \\, i_{RL}(t) + L_{g} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}i_{RL}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}$$\n\nTo derive a single differential equation for $v_g(t)$, we must eliminate $i_{RL}(t)$. From the KCL equation, we express $i_{RL}(t)$ in terms of $v_g(t)$ and $i_M(t)$:\n$$i_{RL}(t) = i_{M}(t) - C_{gs} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{g}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}$$\nDifferentiating this expression with respect to time gives:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}i_{RL}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}i_{M}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} - C_{gs} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2v_{g}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t^2}$$\nSubstituting these two expressions for $i_{RL}(t)$ and its derivative into the KVL equation:\n$$v_{g}(t) = R \\left( i_{M}(t) - C_{gs} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{g}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\right) + L_{g} \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{d}i_{M}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} - C_{gs} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2v_{g}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} \\right)$$\nRearranging the terms to group the derivatives of $v_g(t)$ on the left side:\n$$L_{g}C_{gs} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2v_{g}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} + R C_{gs} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{g}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} + v_{g}(t) = L_{g} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}i_{M}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} + R \\, i_{M}(t)$$\nThe problem asks for the homogeneous differential equation, which describes the source-free network ($i_{M}(t) = 0$). Setting the right-hand side to zero, we obtain:\n$$L_{g}C_{gs} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2v_{g}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} + R C_{gs} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{g}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} + v_{g}(t) = 0$$\nTo identify the natural frequency and damping ratio, we divide by $L_{g}C_{gs}$ to put the equation in the standard canonical form of a second-order linear system, $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2x}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} + 2\\zeta\\omega_{n}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\omega_{n}^2 x = 0$:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2v_{g}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} + \\frac{R}{L_{g}} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{g}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{1}{L_{g}C_{gs}} v_{g}(t) = 0$$\nBy comparing the coefficients with the canonical form, we can identify $\\omega_{n}$ and $\\zeta$:\n$$\\omega_{n}^2 = \\frac{1}{L_{g}C_{gs}} \\implies \\omega_{n} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{L_{g}C_{gs}}}$$\n$$2\\zeta\\omega_{n} = \\frac{R}{L_{g}} \\implies \\zeta = \\frac{R}{2L_{g}\\omega_{n}} = \\frac{R}{2L_{g}} \\sqrt{L_{g}C_{gs}} = \\frac{R}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{C_{gs}}{L_{g}}}$$\n\n**2) Calculation of Damped Frequency and Damping Ratio**\n\nFirst, we calculate the constant natural frequency $\\omega_{n}$:\n$$\\omega_{n} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(10 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{H})(4.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{F})}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\text{s}^2}} = 1.5811 \\times 10^8 \\,\\text{rad/s}$$\nThe damping ratio $\\zeta$ depends on $R = R_{p} + R_{c}$. The damped ringing frequency is given by $\\omega_{d} = \\omega_{n}\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}$, and in Hertz, $f_{d} = \\omega_{d}/(2\\pi)$.\n\n- **No clamp resistance, $R_{c} = 0\\,\\Omega$:**\nThe total resistance is $R = R_{p} = 0.50\\,\\Omega$.\n$$\\zeta = \\frac{0.50\\,\\Omega}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{F}}{10 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{H}}} = 0.25\\sqrt{0.4} \\approx 0.158$$\nSince $\\zeta < 1$, the system is underdamped.\n$$f_{d} = \\frac{\\omega_{n}}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2} = \\frac{1.5811 \\times 10^8}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{1 - (0.158)^2} \\approx 2.48 \\times 10^7\\,\\text{Hz} = 24.8\\,\\text{MHz}$$\n\n- **Finite clamp resistance, $R_{c} = 2.0\\,\\Omega$:**\nThe total resistance is $R = R_{p} + R_{c} = 0.50\\,\\Omega + 2.0\\,\\Omega = 2.5\\,\\Omega$.\n$$\\zeta = \\frac{2.5\\,\\Omega}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{F}}{10 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{H}}} = 1.25\\sqrt{0.4} \\approx 0.791$$\nThe system is still underdamped ($\\zeta < 1$), but significantly more damped.\n$$f_{d} = \\frac{\\omega_{n}}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2} = \\frac{1.5811 \\times 10^8}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{1 - (0.791)^2} \\approx 1.54 \\times 10^7\\,\\text{Hz} = 15.4\\,\\text{MHz}$$\n\n**3) Explanation of Overshoot-Driven False Turn-On**\n\nA false turn-on occurs if the gate-to-source voltage $v_g(t)$ exceeds the threshold voltage $V_{th}$. A simple quasi-static analysis might only consider the DC resistance $R$ of the gate path, predicting a voltage of $v_{g,qs} = i_{M} R$. For the unclamped case ($R = 0.50\\,\\Omega$), the injected current is $i_M = C_{gd} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{ds}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = (30 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{F})(50 \\times 10^9\\,\\text{V/s}) = 1.5\\,\\text{A}$. This would suggest a voltage of $v_{g,qs} = (1.5\\,\\text{A})(0.50\\,\\Omega) = 0.75\\,\\text{V}$, which is well below $V_{th} = 3.5\\,\\text{V}$.\n\nHowever, this quasi-static view is incomplete. The gate network is a resonant $RLC$ circuit. A fast-rising drain voltage induces a sharp pulse of Miller current $i_M(t)$, which acts as a high-frequency stimulus. For an underdamped system ($\\zeta  1$), the response to such a stimulus is an oscillation (ringing) superimposed on the steady-state response. This ringing is due to the exchange of energy between the capacitive element ($C_{gs}$) and the inductive element ($L_g$). The initial surge of current stores energy in these reactive components. The system's response to this sudden injection of energy is to oscillate, and the first peak of this oscillation significantly overshoots the final steady-state value. The magnitude of the overshoot is a direct function of the damping ratio $\\zeta$; lower damping leads to higher overshoot. Consequently, even if the quasi-static voltage $i_M R$ is below $V_{th}$, the peak of the first voltage ring, $v_{g,\\text{peak}}$, can easily surpass $V_{th}$, causing an unintended and potentially destructive turn-on of the MOSFET.\n\n**4) Determination of Minimum Clamp Resistance $R_{c,\\min}$**\n\nTo eliminate overshoot-driven threshold crossings within this linear model, the system must be at least critically damped. An oscillatory response with overshoot is characteristic only of underdamped systems ($\\zeta  1$). The condition for critical damping is $\\zeta = 1$. For any $\\zeta \\ge 1$, the response will be non-oscillatory, and for a step-like input, there will be no overshoot. Therefore, we must find the minimum clamp resistance $R_{c,\\min}$ that results in $\\zeta = 1$.\n\nThe condition on the total resistance $R$ is:\n$$\\zeta = \\frac{R}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{C_{gs}}{L_{g}}} = 1$$\nSolving for the required total resistance, $R_{crit}$:\n$$R_{crit} = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{L_{g}}{C_{gs}}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$R_{crit} = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{10 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{H}}{4.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{F}}} = 2\\sqrt{2.5} \\approx 3.162\\,\\Omega$$\nThis is the total resistance required in the gate loop for critical damping. This total resistance is the sum of the parasitic resistance $R_p$ and the added clamp resistance $R_c$.\n$$R_{crit} = R_{p} + R_{c,\\min}$$\nSolving for the minimum clamp resistance $R_{c,\\min}$:\n$$R_{c,\\min} = R_{crit} - R_{p}$$\n$$R_{c,\\min} = 3.162\\,\\Omega - 0.50\\,\\Omega = 2.662\\,\\Omega$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get $R_{c,\\min} = 2.66\\,\\Omega$.",

The immunity is provided by an Active Miller Clamp (AMC) associated with the gate driver of each MOSFET.\n\nLet us establish a clear timeline of events based on the problem statement. The origin of time, $t=0$, is defined as the instant the lower device is commanded to turn off.\n\n1.  At $t=0$, the gate of the lower MOSFET receives a command to turn off.\n2.  The AMC for the lower device does not engage instantaneously. It becomes active after an internal activation delay, $t_{c}$, measured from the off command. Therefore, the AMC for the lower device is engaged for all times $t \\ge t_{c}$. The problem states $t_{c} = 21.347\\,\\text{ns}$.\n3.  The deadtime, $t_{d}$, is the interval between the turn-off command for the lower device and the turn-on command for the upper device. Thus, the upper device is commanded to turn on at time $t=t_{d}$.\n4.  The turn-on of the upper device causes the drain-source voltage of the lower device, $V_{DS}$, to rise. This voltage transition, which is the event that can induce a false turn-on, begins at $t=t_{d}$ and lasts for a duration $t_{v}$. The interval during which the lower device is susceptible to a capacitively induced turn-on is therefore $[t_{d}, \\, t_{d}+t_{v}]$. The problem specifies $t_{v} = 52.64\\,\\text{ns}$.\n\nThe critical requirement for ensuring false turn-on immunity is that the AMC must be active throughout the entire duration of the $V_{DS}$ voltage transition. In our established timeline, this means the AMC must be active for the entire time interval $[t_{d}, \\, t_{d}+t_{v}]$.\n\nThe AMC becomes active at $t=t_{c}$ and, as stated in the problem, remains active as long as the gate is held low. In the scenario described, the lower device's gate is held low for the entire duration of interest. Therefore, for any time $t \\ge t_{c}$, the AMC is active.\n\nTo satisfy the condition that the AMC is active throughout the interval $[t_{d}, \\, t_{d}+t_{v}]$, it must be active at the very beginning of this interval, i.e., at time $t=t_{d}$. If the AMC is active at $t=t_{d}$, it will remain active until $t=t_{d}+t_{v}$ and beyond.\n\nThe condition for the AMC to be active at time $t=t_{d}$ is that the time $t_{d}$ must be greater than or equal to the time of the AMC activation, $t_{c}$. This can be expressed as the inequality:\n$$t_{d} \\ge t_{c}$$\n\nTo find the minimum possible deadtime, $t_{d,\\min}$, that satisfies this condition, we must choose the smallest value of $t_{d}$ that is valid. This corresponds to the case of equality in the inequality above.\n$$t_{d,\\min} = t_{c}$$\n\nThe duration of the voltage transition, $t_{v}$, defines the period over which the protection is needed, but it does not influence the calculation for the minimum required deadtime.
