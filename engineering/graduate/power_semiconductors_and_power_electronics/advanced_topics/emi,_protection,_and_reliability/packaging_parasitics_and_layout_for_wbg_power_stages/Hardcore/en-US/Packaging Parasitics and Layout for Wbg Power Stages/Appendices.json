The governing equation is the fundamental constitutive relation for an inductor. The provided values for bus voltage and current slew rate are realistic for modern power electronics applications. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary data provided to derive the required condition and calculate the numerical value. The terminology is precise and objective. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A detailed solution will be provided.\n\nThe voltage overshoot, $V_{\\text{os}}$, across the total commutation loop inductance, $L_{\\text{loop}}$, is caused by the rapid change in current during the device turn-off. This relationship is described by the constitutive equation for an inductor. The magnitude of the overshoot voltage is given by:\n$$V_{\\text{os}} = L_{\\text{loop}} \\left| \\frac{di}{dt} \\right|$$\nHere, $\\left| \\frac{di}{dt} \\right|$ represents the magnitude of the current slew rate. During turn-off, the current decreases, so $\\frac{di}{dt}$ is negative, but the resulting voltage overshoot adds to the bus voltage, so we consider its magnitude.\n\nThe problem specifies a constraint on this voltage overshoot. It must not exceed $10\\%$ of the DC bus voltage, $V_{\\text{dc}}$. The maximum permissible voltage overshoot, $V_{\\text{os,max}}$, is therefore:\n$$V_{\\text{os,max}} = 0.10 \\times V_{\\text{dc}}$$\nSubstituting the given value for the DC bus voltage, $V_{\\text{dc}} = 400 \\, \\text{V}$:\n$$V_{\\text{os,max}} = 0.10 \\times 400 \\, \\text{V} = 40 \\, \\text{V}$$\nThe design condition is that the actual overshoot must be less than or equal to this maximum value:\n$$V_{\\text{os}} \\le V_{\\text{os,max}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $V_{\\text{os}}$ into this inequality, we obtain the condition on the loop inductance $L_{\\text{loop}}$:\n$$L_{\\text{loop}} \\left| \\frac{di}{dt} \\right| \\le V_{\\text{os,max}}$$\nTo find the maximum allowable loop inductance, $L_{\\text{loop,max}}$, we solve the equality condition:\n$$L_{\\text{loop,max}} \\left| \\frac{di}{dt} \\right| = V_{\\text{os,max}}$$\nRearranging the equation to solve for $L_{\\text{loop,max}}$ gives:\n$$L_{\\text{loop,max}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{os,max}}}{\\left| \\frac{di}{dt} \\right|}$$\nWe are given the target current slew rate $\\left| \\frac{di}{dt} \\right| = 200 \\, \\text{A}/\\mu\\text{s}$. To maintain consistency in SI units (Volts, Amperes, Seconds, Henries), we must convert the time unit from microseconds ($\\mu\\text{s}$) to seconds ($\\text{s}$).\n$$1 \\, \\mu\\text{s} = 10^{-6} \\, \\text{s}$$\nTherefore, the current slew rate in Amperes per second is:\n$$\\left| \\frac{di}{dt} \\right| = 200 \\, \\frac{\\text{A}}{10^{-6} \\, \\text{s}} = 200 \\times 10^6 \\, \\frac{\\text{A}}{\\text{s}} = 2 \\times 10^8 \\, \\frac{\\text{A}}{\\text{s}}$$\nNow, we can substitute the numerical values for $V_{\\text{os,max}}$ and $\\left| \\frac{di}{dt} \\right|$ into the expression for $L_{\\text{loop,max}}$:\n$$L_{\\text{loop,max}} = \\frac{40 \\, \\text{V}}{2 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{A/s}}$$\n$$L_{\\text{loop,max}} = 20 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\frac{\\text{V} \\cdot \\text{s}}{\\text{A}} = 2 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{H}$$\nThe unit Henry ($\\text{H}$) is equivalent to Volt-second per Ampere ($\\text{V} \\cdot \\text{s} / \\text{A}$).\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in nanohenries ($\\text{nH}$).

This shared inductance develops a counteracting voltage, $\\Delta V_{gs} = L_{cs} \\frac{di}{dt}$, that creates a negative feedback effect, slowing the switching transition.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains sufficient information for a quantitative solution and a qualitative discussion. It describes a common and critical issue in the design of high-frequency power electronics using wide-bandgap semiconductors.\n\nThe problem describes a Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) configuration where the gate driver's return path and the main power current return path are shared. This shared path possesses a parasitic inductance, termed the common-source inductance, $L_{cs}$. We are asked to derive and quantify the voltage drop across this inductance during a turn-on event and discuss its implications.\n\nLet us model the gate drive loop. The gate driver applies a voltage, let us call it $v_{drv}$, to the external gate ($G$) and source ($S$) terminals of the MOSFET package. The internal semiconductor structure, however, responds to the effective gate-source voltage, $v_{gs,eff}$, which is the potential difference between the internal gate and source bond points. The common-source inductance $L_{cs}$ exists in the path between the internal source connection and the external source terminal $S$ to which the gate driver ground is referenced.\n\nAccording to Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL) applied to the gate driver loop, the voltage applied by the driver at the external terminals, $v_{G-S}$, is distributed among the components in the loop. For the purpose of analyzing the effect of $L_{cs}$, we can write the relationship between the externally applied voltage and the internal effective voltage as:\n$$v_{gs,drv}(t) = v_{gs,eff}(t) + v_{Lcs}(t)$$\nHere, we neglect the voltage drop across the gate resistance for simplicity, as the primary focus is on the inductive effect. $v_{Lcs}(t)$ is the voltage induced across the common-source inductance. This equation shows that the voltage induced across $L_{cs}$ directly subtracts from the driver-applied voltage, reducing the effective voltage seen by the MOSFET channel.\n\nThe voltage across an inductor is governed by Faraday's law of induction, which states that the induced electromotive force (voltage) is proportional to the rate of change of current flowing through it. The current flowing through the common-source inductance $L_{cs}$ is the source power current, $i_S(t)$. During a hard turn-on transition, the source current is approximately equal to the drain current, $i_D(t)$, which we denote as $i(t)$. Therefore, the voltage $v_{Lcs}(t)$ is given by:\n$$v_{Lcs}(t) = L_{cs} \\frac{di_S(t)}{dt} \\approx L_{cs} \\frac{di(t)}{dt}$$\n\nThe instantaneous reduction in the effective gate-to-source voltage, which we can call the droop voltage $\\Delta V_{gs}$, is equal to this induced voltage $v_{Lcs}(t)$.\nThus, the derived expression for the droop is:\n$$\\Delta V_{gs} = L_{cs} \\frac{di}{dt}$$\n\nWe are given the following values:\nCommon-source inductance, $L_{cs} = 3\\,\\text{nH} = 3 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{H}$.\nDrain current slew rate, $\\frac{di}{dt} = 250\\,\\text{A}/\\mu\\text{s}$.\n\nFirst, we must ensure consistent units. The slew rate must be converted to amperes per second:\n$$\\frac{di}{dt} = \\frac{250\\,\\text{A}}{1 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{s}} = 250 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{A/s}$$\n\nNow, we can compute the magnitude of the voltage droop:\n$$\\Delta V_{gs} = (3 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{H}) \\times (250 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{A/s})$$\n$$\\Delta V_{gs} = 3 \\times 250 \\times 10^{(-9+6)}\\,\\text{V}$$\n$$\\Delta V_{gs} = 750 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{V} = 0.75\\,\\text{V}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated magnitude is $0.750\\,\\text{V}$.\n\nFinally, we discuss the implications of this voltage droop. The calculated droop of $0.750\\,\\text{V}$ is a substantial value in the context of SiC MOSFET gate drive characteristics, where threshold voltages $V_{th}$ are typically in the range of $2\\,\\text{V}$ to $4\\,\\text{V}$. This droop introduces a potent negative feedback mechanism into the switching process. As the gate driver increases the applied gate voltage to turn the device on, the device begins to conduct, and the current $i(t)$ starts to rise. This rising current induces the voltage droop $\\Delta V_{gs}$ across $L_{cs}$, which counteracts the applied gate voltage. This opposition slows the rate of increase of the effective gate-source voltage $v_{gs,eff}$, thereby limiting the current slew rate $\\frac{di}{dt}$ that the device can achieve.\n\nThis has significant implications for the consistency of the turn-on delay. The turn-on time of a MOSFET is strongly dependent on the gate voltage exceeding the threshold voltage $V_{th}$ and then reaching the Miller plateau. The presence of the $L_{cs}\\frac{di}{dt}$ droop makes the switching characteristics, including turn-on delay and current rise time, dependent not only on the gate drive circuit ($V_{drv}$, $R_g$) but also on the instantaneous power circuit conditions ($\\frac{di}{dt}$).\n\nVariations in device transconductance ($g_m = \\frac{\\partial i_D}{\\partial v_{gs}}$) or operating conditions (e.g., DC bus voltage) lead to inconsistencies. For example, a device with a higher-than-average $g_m$ will attempt to switch with a higher intrinsic $\\frac{di}{dt}$. However, this will induce a larger voltage droop from $L_{cs}$, which in turn slows the device down, partially negating the effect of the higher $g_m$. Similarly, an increase in DC bus voltage would naturally lead to a higher $\\frac{di}{dt}$, but the resulting larger droop will lengthen the turn-on transition. Consequently, the switching behavior becomes less predictable and less controllable, as it is dynamically influenced by this negative feedback. In applications with parallel-connected devices, this effect can lead to imbalances in dynamic current sharing if the parasitic inductances are not perfectly matched.\n\nThe standard engineering solution to this problem is the use of a Kelvin source connection. A dedicated, low-power return path is provided from the internal source of the MOSFET directly to the gate driver's ground. This decouples the gate drive loop from the high-current power loop, ensuring that the large $\\frac{di}{dt}$ of the power current does not induce a voltage droop in the gate-source path. This allows for faster, more consistent, and more precisely controlled switching, fully realizing the speed advantages of SiC devices. The absence of such a connection, as specified in this problem, is a distinct layout deficiency.",
