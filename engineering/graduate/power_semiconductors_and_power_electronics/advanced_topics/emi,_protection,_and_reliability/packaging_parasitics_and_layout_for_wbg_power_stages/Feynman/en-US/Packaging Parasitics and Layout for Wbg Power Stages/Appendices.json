The problem is self-contained, with all necessary data provided to derive the required condition and calculate the numerical value. The terminology is precise and objective. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A detailed solution will be provided.\n\nThe voltage overshoot, $V_{\\text{os}}$, across the total commutation loop inductance, $L_{\\text{loop}}$, is caused by the rapid change in current during the device turn-off. This relationship is described by the constitutive equation for an inductor. The magnitude of the overshoot voltage is given by:\n$$V_{\\text{os}} = L_{\\text{loop}} \\left| \\frac{di}{dt} \\right|$$\nHere, $\\left| \\frac{di}{dt} \\right|$ represents the magnitude of the current slew rate. During turn-off, the current decreases, so $\\frac{di}{dt}$ is negative, but the resulting voltage overshoot adds to the bus voltage, so we consider its magnitude.\n\nThe problem specifies a constraint on this voltage overshoot. It must not exceed $10\\%$ of the DC bus voltage, $V_{\\text{dc}}$. The maximum permissible voltage overshoot, $V_{\\text{os,max}}$, is therefore:\n$$V_{\\text{os,max}} = 0.10 \\times V_{\\text{dc}}$$\nSubstituting the given value for the DC bus voltage, $V_{\\text{dc}} = 400 \\, \\text{V}$:\n$$V_{\\text{os,max}} = 0.10 \\times 400 \\, \\text{V} = 40 \\, \\text{V}$$\nThe design condition is that the actual overshoot must be less than or equal to this maximum value:\n$$V_{\\text{os}} \\le V_{\\text{os,max}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $V_{\\text{os}}$ into this inequality, we obtain the condition on the loop inductance $L_{\\text{loop}}$:\n$$L_{\\text{loop}} \\left| \\frac{di}{dt} \\right| \\le V_{\\text{os,max}}$$\nTo find the maximum allowable loop inductance, $L_{\\text{loop,max}}$, we solve the equality condition:\n$$L_{\\text{loop,max}} \\left| \\frac{di}{dt} \\right| = V_{\\text{os,max}}$$\nRearranging the equation to solve for $L_{\\text{loop,max}}$ gives:\n$$L_{\\text{loop,max}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{os,max}}}{\\left| \\frac{di}{dt} \\right|}$$\nWe are given the target current slew rate $\\left| \\frac{di}{dt} \\right| = 200 \\, \\text{A}/\\mu\\text{s}$.

The gate driver holds the external gate connection at $0\\,\\text{V}$ through a gate resistor $R_g$. The Miller capacitance, $C_{gd}$, connects the drain to the gate. A parasitic capacitance, $C_{par}$, exists between the gate and the source. The voltage of interest is the gate-to-source voltage, $v_{gs}(t)$. The source is the local reference, so its potential is $0\\,\\text{V}$.\n\nDuring the switching of the complementary device, the drain-to-source voltage of the off-state MOSFET, $v_{ds}(t)$, rises with a constant slope.

This unintended activation is known as false turn-on or spurious turn-on. It is a critical issue in half-bridge converters as it can lead to a shoot-through current flowing directly from the DC bus through both transistors, causing excessive power dissipation, electromagnetic interference (EMI), and potentially catastrophic device failure. Therefore, false turn-on is highly likely under these conditions.\n\nThe final answer requested is the peak induced gate-to-source voltage.",
