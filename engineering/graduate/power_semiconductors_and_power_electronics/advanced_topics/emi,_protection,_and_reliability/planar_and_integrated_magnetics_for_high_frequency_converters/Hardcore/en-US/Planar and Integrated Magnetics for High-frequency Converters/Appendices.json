The problem is objective and well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and a clear set of tasks: a derivation followed by a numerical calculation with a specific validation condition. The given values are physically plausible for a high-frequency switching converter application. The problem is free from the flaws listed in the validation criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe solution proceeds in two main parts as required: first, the derivation of the magnetizing current amplitude $I_m$, and second, the validation that the peak flux density $B_{\\text{pk}}$ does not exceed the saturation flux density $B_{\\text{sat}}$, followed by the numerical calculation of $I_m$.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Magnetizing Current Amplitude ($I_m$)**\n\nThe primary winding is modeled as a pure magnetizing inductance, $L_m$. The relationship between the voltage across an inductor, $v_L(t)$, and the current through it, $i_L(t)$, is given by the inductor's constitutive relation:\n$$v_L(t) = L \\frac{di_L(t)}{dt}$$\nIn our case, the applied voltage across the primary is $v_{p}(t)$ and the current is the magnetizing current $i_{m}(t)$. Thus, we have:\n$$v_{p}(t) = L_{m} \\frac{di_{m}(t)}{dt}$$\nThe applied voltage is sinusoidal, given by $v_{p}(t) = V_{\\text{pk}} \\sin(2\\pi f t)$. Let $\\omega = 2\\pi f$ be the angular frequency. The equation becomes:\n$$V_{\\text{pk}} \\sin(\\omega t) = L_{m} \\frac{di_{m}(t)}{dt}$$\nTo find the magnetizing current $i_{m}(t)$, we must integrate this expression with respect to time:\n$$i_{m}(t) = \\int \\frac{V_{\\text{pk}}}{L_{m}} \\sin(\\omega t) dt$$\n$$i_{m}(t) = \\frac{V_{\\text{pk}}}{L_{m}} \\int \\sin(\\omega t) dt = \\frac{V_{\\text{pk}}}{L_{m}} \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\omega} \\cos(\\omega t)\\right) + C$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. For a sinusoidal steady-state excitation of a purely inductive element, the current must have a zero time-average value, implying the integration constant $C$ is zero.\n$$i_{m}(t) = -\\frac{V_{\\text{pk}}}{\\omega L_{m}} \\cos(\\omega t)$$\nThe amplitude of the magnetizing current, denoted as $I_m$, is the peak value of this sinusoidal current waveform:\n$$I_{m} = \\left| -\\frac{V_{\\text{pk}}}{\\omega L_{m}} \\right| = \\frac{V_{\\text{pk}}}{\\omega L_{m}}$$\nSubstituting $\\omega = 2\\pi f$, we obtain the expression for the magnetizing current amplitude in terms of the given parameters:\n$$I_{m} = \\frac{V_{\\text{pk}}}{2\\pi f L_{m}}$$\n\n**Part 2: Peak Flux Density Validation and Numerical Calculation**\n\nBefore computing the numerical value of $I_m$, we must verify that the peak flux density in the core, $B_{\\text{pk}}$, does not exceed the saturation flux density, $B_{\\text{sat}}$. This is derived from Faraday's law of induction.\n\nAccording to Faraday's law, the voltage induced across the primary winding is related to the rate of change of magnetic flux, $\\Phi(t)$:\n$$v_{p}(t) = N_{p} \\frac{d\\Phi(t)}{dt}$$\nThe magnetic flux is the product of the magnetic flux density, $B(t)$, and the effective cross-sectional area of the core, $A_{e}$, assuming uniform flux distribution. So, $\\Phi(t) = B(t)A_{e}$.\n$$v_{p}(t) = N_{p} A_{e} \\frac{dB(t)}{dt}$$\nSubstituting the expression for the applied voltage:\n$$V_{\\text{pk}} \\sin(\\omega t) = N_{p} A_{e} \\frac{dB(t)}{dt}$$\nWe integrate with respect to time to find the magnetic flux density $B(t)$:\n$$B(t) = \\int \\frac{V_{\\text{pk}}}{N_{p} A_{e}} \\sin(\\omega t) dt = \\frac{V_{\\text{pk}}}{N_{p} A_{e}} \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\omega} \\cos(\\omega t)\\right) + C_{B}$$\nAssuming no DC flux offset in steady state, the integration constant $C_{B}$ is zero.\n$$B(t) = -\\frac{V_{\\text{pk}}}{\\omega N_{p} A_{e}} \\cos(\\omega t)$$\nThe peak flux density, $B_{\\text{pk}}$, is the amplitude of this waveform:\n$$B_{\\text{pk}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{pk}}}{\\omega N_{p} A_{e}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{pk}}}{2\\pi f N_{p} A_{e}}$$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values to compute $B_{\\text{pk}}$.

We check the condition:\n$$B_{\\text{pk}} \\approx 0.079577\\ \\mathrm{T} < 0.25\\ \\mathrm{T} = B_{\\text{sat}}$$\nSince the peak flux density is less than the saturation flux density, the excitation is valid and the core will not saturate. We can now proceed to calculate the magnetizing current amplitude.\n\nUsing the derived formula for $I_m$ and the given parameters:\n- $V_{\\text{pk}} = 50\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n- $f = 500\\ \\mathrm{kHz} = 500 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$\n- $L_{m} = 250\\ \\mathrm{\\mu H} = 250 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{H}$\n$$I_{m} = \\frac{V_{\\text{pk}}}{2\\pi f L_{m}} = \\frac{50}{2\\pi (500 \\times 10^{3}) (250 \\times 10^{-6})} = \\frac{50}{2\\pi (5 \\times 10^{5}) (2.5 \\times 10^{-4})} = \\frac{50}{2\\pi (12.5 \\times 10^{1})} = \\frac{50}{250\\pi} = \\frac{1}{5\\pi}\\ \\mathrm{A}$$\n$$I_{m} \\approx 0.063661977...\\ \\mathrm{A}$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures as requested, we get:\n$$I_{m} \\approx 0.06366\\ \\mathrm{A}$$",
