            "problem": "A wide bandgap (WBG) half-bridge power stage using Silicon Carbide (SiC) metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors is built on a compact laminate with an exposed heatsink tied to chassis. Due to the three-dimensional current return geometry in the package and layout, there exists a parasitic capacitance between the switching node copper island and the chassis/heatsink. During hard switching, the switching node voltage exhibits a fast transition with high slew rate, exciting displacement currents through this parasitic path that manifest as common-mode noise at the input and output ports.\n\n(a) Using first principles, define differential-mode Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) and common-mode EMI for a two-conductor power port with respect to a global reference (chassis).

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of electromagnetism and power electronics, well-posed, and objective. It addresses a real-world engineering challenge in the design of high-frequency power converters using wide bandgap semiconductors. The provided data are realistic and sufficient to obtain a unique, meaningful solution.\n\n(a) Differential-mode (DM) and common-mode (CM) quantities for a two-conductor power port can be defined with respect to a common reference ground, such as the chassis. Let the potentials of the two conductors (e.g., power and return lines) with respect to the chassis be $v_{+}(t)$ and $v_{-}(t)$, and let the currents flowing in these conductors be $i_{+}(t)$ and $i_{-}(t)$, with the convention that positive current flows from the source to the load.\n\nThe differential-mode voltage, $v_{\\mathrm{dm}}(t)$, is the potential difference between the two conductors, representing the normal operating voltage that drives the load. It is defined as:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{dm}}(t) = v_{+}(t) - v_{-}(t)$$\n\nThe common-mode voltage, $v_{\\mathrm{cm}}(t)$, is the average potential of the two conductors with respect to the reference chassis. This voltage drives currents that flow through parasitic paths to the chassis. It is defined as:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{cm}}(t) = \\frac{v_{+}(t) + v_{-}(t)}{2}$$\n\nFrom these definitions, the individual conductor potentials can be expressed in terms of DM and CM components:\n$$v_{+}(t) = v_{\\mathrm{cm}}(t) + \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{dm}}(t)}{2}$$\n$$v_{-}(t) = v_{\\mathrm{cm}}(t) - \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{dm}}(t)}{2}$$\n\nSimilarly, the currents in the conductors can be decomposed into DM and CM components. The differential-mode current, $i_{\\mathrm{dm}}(t)$, is the functional current that circulates between the source and load. It flows in opposite directions in the two conductors. The common-mode current, $i_{\\mathrm{cm}}(t)$, is the parasitic or noise current that flows in the same direction in both conductors and finds its return path through the chassis.\nThe conductor currents $i_{+}(t)$ and $i_{-}(t)$ can be defined as:\n$$i_{+}(t) = i_{\\mathrm{dm}}(t) + i_{\\mathrm{cm}}(t)$$\n$$i_{-}(t) = -i_{\\mathrm{dm}}(t) + i_{\\mathrm{cm}}(t)$$\nNote the sign convention for the differential-mode component. By solving this system of equations for $i_{\\mathrm{dm}}(t)$ and $i_{\\mathrm{cm}}(t)$, we obtain their definitions in terms of the measurable line currents:\n$$i_{\\mathrm{dm}}(t) = \\frac{i_{+}(t) - i_{-}(t)}{2}$$\n$$i_{\\mathrm{cm}}(t) = \\frac{i_{+}(t) + i_{-}(t)}{2}$$\nThe total common-mode current returning through the chassis is $i_{+}(t) + i_{-}(t) = 2i_{\\mathrm{cm}}(t)$.\n\n(b) The common-mode displacement current through the parasitic capacitance $C_{\\mathrm{par}}$ can be derived from the fundamental constitutive relation for a capacitor. A capacitor stores charge $q$ in proportion to the voltage $v$ across its terminals, given by the relation:\n$$q(t) = C v(t)$$\nIn this problem, the capacitor is the parasitic capacitance $C_{\\mathrm{par}}$ that exists between the switching node and the chassis. The voltage across this capacitance is the switching-node potential with respect to chassis, $v_{\\mathrm{sw}}(t)$. Therefore, the charge stored on the switching node 'plate' of this parasitic capacitor is:\n$$q_{\\mathrm{par}}(t) = C_{\\mathrm{par}} v_{\\mathrm{sw}}(t)$$\nBy the principle of charge conservation, electric current is the time rate of change of charge. The current flowing from the switching node into the capacitor, which then flows to the chassis as displacement current, is $i(t) = \\mathrm{d}q/\\mathrm{d}t$. Applying this to the charge $q_{\\mathrm{par}}(t)$, we find the common-mode displacement current, $i_{\\mathrm{cm,disp}}(t)$:\n$$i_{\\mathrm{cm,disp}}(t) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}q_{\\mathrm{par}}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\left( C_{\\mathrm{par}} v_{\\mathrm{sw}}(t) \\right)$$\nThe problem states that $C_{\\mathrm{par}}$ can be assumed to be voltage-independent, which means it is a constant with respect to time during the switching transition. Therefore, it can be taken out of the derivative:\n$$i_{\\mathrm{cm,disp}}(t) = C_{\\mathrm{par}} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{\\mathrm{sw}}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}$$\nThis expression shows that the common-mode current is directly proportional to both the parasitic capacitance and the slew rate of the switching node voltage. This current path is from the switching node, through the dielectric separating it from the chassis, to the chassis, and back to the source through the input power connections, thus completing a common-mode loop.\n\nPackage and layout choices significantly influence both terms in this expression, $C_{\\mathrm{par}}$ and $\\mathrm{d}v_{\\mathrm{sw}}/\\mathrm{d}t$.\nThe parasitic capacitance $C_{\\mathrm{par}}$ is determined by the physical geometry and materials. It can be approximated by the parallel-plate formula $C = \\epsilon A/d$, where $\\epsilon$ is the permittivity of the dielectric, $A$ is the overlapping area between the switching node copper and the chassis/heatsink, and $d$ is the thickness of the insulating layer. Choices to reduce $C_{\\mathrm{par}}$ include:\n1. Minimizing the area $A$ of the switching node copper plane.\n2. Maximizing the distance $d$ (insulator thickness) between the switching node and the chassis, although this often conflicts with thermal design goals which favor thin insulators for better heat transfer.\n3. Using an insulating material with a lower dielectric constant ($\\epsilon_r$).\n4. Implementing shielding techniques, such as inserting a grounded conducting layer between the switching node and the chassis to terminate the electric field lines locally.\n\nThe slew rate $\\mathrm{d}v_{\\mathrm{sw}}/\\mathrm{d}t$ is a primary characteristic of WBG devices, valued for reducing switching losses. However, it is the driver of this EMI mechanism. It is influenced by:\n1. The intrinsic properties of the WBG semiconductor device (e.g., SiC MOSFETs have very low internal capacitances, enabling fast voltage transitions).\n2. The gate driver circuit design. A lower gate resistance ($R_g$) allows for faster charging and discharging of the MOSFET's input capacitance, leading to a higher $\\mathrm{d}v/\\mathrm{d}t$. Increasing $R_g$ is a common method to slow down switching and mitigate EMI, at the expense of increased switching losses.\n3. The power loop parasitic inductance. A high-inductance layout for the high-frequency current loop in the half-bridge can cause voltage overshoot and ringing, which involves very high instantaneous $\\mathrm{d}v/\\mathrm{d}t$ values. Minimizing this loop inductance through compact layout design is critical not only for reducing EMI but also for ensuring device reliability.\n\n(c) To compute the peak common-mode current magnitude, we use the derived expression with the given values. The peak current occurs when the slew rate is at its maximum specified value.\nThe expression for the current is:\n$$i_{\\mathrm{cm,peak}} = C_{\\mathrm{par}} \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{\\mathrm{sw}}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\right)_{\\mathrm{max}}$$\nThe given values are:\nParasitic capacitance, $C_{\\mathrm{par}} = 100 \\text{ pF} = 100 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ F}$.\nSwitching-node slew rate, $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{\\mathrm{sw}}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 50 \\frac{\\text{V}}{\\text{ns}} = 50 \\frac{\\text{V}}{10^{-9} \\text{ s}} = 50 \\times 10^9 \\frac{\\text{V}}{\\text{s}}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n$$i_{\\mathrm{cm,peak}} = (100 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ F}) \\times (50 \\times 10^9 \\text{ V/s})$$\n$$i_{\\mathrm{cm,peak}} = (1 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ F}) \\times (5 \\times 10^{10} \\text{ V/s})$$\n$$i_{\\mathrm{cm,peak}} = (1 \\times 5) \\times 10^{-10+10} \\text{ A}$$\n$$i_{\\mathrm{cm,peak}} = 5 \\text{ A}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. Therefore, the peak common-mode current magnitude is $5.00$ A.",

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. I will now proceed to derive the solution.\n\n###\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe measured voltages on the Line ($L$) and Neutral ($N$) conductors, $V_L$ and $V_N$, are represented as the superposition of their common-mode and differential-mode components.\n\nLet $V_{CM}$ be the common-mode voltage phasor. By definition, this voltage appears identically on both conductors with respect to ground:\n$$V_{L,CM} = V_{N,CM} = V_{CM}$$\n\nLet $V_{DM}$ be the differential-mode voltage phasor component. By definition, this component appears with equal magnitude and opposite polarity on the two conductors with respect to ground:\n$$V_{L,DM} = V_{DM}$$\n$$V_{N,DM} = -V_{DM}$$\nThis formulation is standard, where $V_{DM}$ represents the component on the Line conductor. The voltage between the conductors due to the differential mode is $V_L - V_N = (V_{CM} + V_{DM}) - (V_{CM} - V_{DM}) = 2V_{DM}$.\n\nApplying the principle of superposition:\n$$V_L = V_{L,CM} + V_{L,DM} = V_{CM} + V_{DM} \\quad (1)$$\n$$V_N = V_{N,CM} + V_{N,DM} = V_{CM} - V_{DM} \\quad (2)$$\n\nThis system of two linear equations can be solved for the unknowns $V_{CM}$ and $V_{DM}$.\n\nTo find $V_{CM}$, we add equations $(1)$ and $(2)$:\n$$V_L + V_N = (V_{CM} + V_{DM}) + (V_{CM} - V_{DM}) = 2V_{CM}$$\n$$\\implies V_{CM} = \\frac{V_L + V_N}{2}$$\n\nTo find $V_{DM}$, we subtract equation $(2)$ from equation $(1)$:\n$$V_L - V_N = (V_{CM} + V_{DM}) - (V_{CM} - V_{DM}) = 2V_{DM}$$\n$$\\implies V_{DM} = \\frac{V_L - V_N}{2}$$\n\nThe validity of this decomposition relies fundamentally on the symmetry of the circuit, specifically that the impedance from the Line conductor to ground is equal to the impedance from the Neutral conductor to ground ($Z_{L-G} = Z_{N-G}$). The problem states this condition by specifying two \"identical\" LISNs.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nThe given phasors are $V_L = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{V}\\angle 30^\\circ$ and $V_N = 0.06\\,\\mathrm{V}\\angle -120^\\circ$. We convert these to rectangular form, $z = r(\\cos\\theta + j\\sin\\theta)$, for calculation.\n\n$$V_L = 0.10(\\cos(30^\\circ) + j\\sin(30^\\circ)) = 0.10\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} + j\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\approx 0.08660 + j0.05000\\,\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n$$V_N = 0.06(\\cos(-120^\\circ) + j\\sin(-120^\\circ)) = 0.06\\left(-\\frac{1}{2} - j\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) \\approx -0.03000 - j0.05196\\,\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n\nNow we compute the sum and difference:\n$$V_L + V_N = (0.08660 - 0.03000) + j(0.05000 - 0.05196) = 0.05660 - j0.00196\\,\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n$$V_L - V_N = (0.08660 - (-0.03000)) + j(0.05000 - (-0.05196)) = 0.11660 + j0.10196\\,\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n\nNow, we find $V_{CM}$ and $V_{DM}$:\n$$V_{CM} = \\frac{V_L + V_N}{2} = \\frac{0.05660 - j0.00196}{2} = 0.02830 - j0.00098\\,\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nTo convert $V_{CM}$ to polar form ($r\\angle\\theta$):\nMagnitude: $|V_{CM}| = \\sqrt{(0.02830)^2 + (-0.00098)^2} \\approx \\sqrt{0.00080185} \\approx 0.028317\\,\\mathrm{V} \\approx 28.3\\,\\mathrm{mV}$\nAngle: $\\angle V_{CM} = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{-0.00098}{0.02830}\\right) \\approx -1.98^\\circ \\approx -2.0^\\circ$\nThus, $V_{CM} \\approx 28.3\\,\\mathrm{mV}\\angle -2.0^\\circ$.\n\n$$V_{DM} = \\frac{V_L - V_N}{2} = \\frac{0.11660 + j0.10196}{2} = 0.05830 + j0.05098\\,\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nTo convert $V_{DM}$ to polar form:\nMagnitude: $|V_{DM}| = \\sqrt{(0.05830)^2 + (0.05098)^2} \\approx \\sqrt{0.0059979} \\approx 0.07745\\,\\mathrm{V} \\approx 77.5\\,\\mathrm{mV}$\nAngle: $\\angle V_{DM} = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{0.05098}{0.05830}\\right) \\approx 41.16^\\circ \\approx 41.2^\\circ$\nThus, $V_{DM} \\approx 77.5\\,\\mathrm{mV}\\angle 41.2^\\circ$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.

The quantity $V_L - V_N$ is the line-to-line differential voltage, not the differential-mode component voltage $V_{DM}$ as standardly defined in this decomposition. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D.

It is scientifically grounded in linear circuit theory and electromagnetic interference (EMI) analysis, well-posed with all necessary data and definitions, and objective. The problem is a standard engineering task involving the analysis and worst-case design of an EMI filter.\n\nThe first step is to derive the general attenuation expression for the described $L$-$C$-$R$ filter section. The filter consists of a series inductor with impedance $Z_L$ and a load composed of a capacitor with impedance $Z_C$ in parallel with a resistor $R$. The input voltage is $V_{\\text{in}}$ (upstream of the inductor) and the output voltage is $V_{\\text{out}}$ (across the parallel load).\n\nThe impedance of the series inductor is given by:\n$$Z_L = j\\omega L$$\nThe admittance of the parallel combination of the capacitor $C$ and the resistor $R$ is:\n$$Y_{\\text{load}} = \\frac{1}{R} + j\\omega C$$\nThe impedance of this parallel load is the reciprocal of its admittance:\n$$Z_{\\text{load}} = \\frac{1}{Y_{\\text{load}}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{R} + j\\omega C} = \\frac{R}{1 + j\\omega RC}$$\nUsing the voltage divider rule, the transfer function $H(j\\omega)$ from the input to the output is:\n$$H(j\\omega) = \\frac{V_{\\text{out}}}{V_{\\text{in}}} = \\frac{Z_{\\text{load}}}{Z_L + Z_{\\text{load}}} = \\frac{\\frac{R}{1 + j\\omega RC}}{j\\omega L + \\frac{R}{1 + j\\omega RC}}$$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $(1 + j\\omega RC)$ gives:\n$$H(j\\omega) = \\frac{R}{j\\omega L(1 + j\\omega RC) + R} = \\frac{R}{R + j\\omega L - \\omega^2 LCR}$$\nTo simplify, we can divide the numerator and denominator by $R$:\n$$H(j\\omega) = \\frac{1}{1 - \\omega^2 LC + j\\frac{\\omega L}{R}}$$\nThe \"transfer magnitude\" is the magnitude of this complex transfer function:\n$$|H(j\\omega)| = \\frac{|1|}{|(1 - \\omega^2 LC) + j(\\frac{\\omega L}{R})|} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(1 - \\omega^2 LC)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\omega L}{R}\\right)^2}}$$\nAttenuation, in decibels (dB), is defined as the negative of the gain in dB:\n$$A_{\\text{dB}} = -20 \\log_{10}(|H(j\\omega)|) = 20 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{1}{|H(j\\omega)|}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $|H(j\\omega)|$:\n$$A_{\\text{dB}} = 20 \\log_{10}\\left(\\sqrt{(1 - \\omega^2 LC)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\omega L}{R}\\right)^2}\\right)$$\nThis can also be written as:\n$$A_{\\text{dB}} = 10 \\log_{10}\\left((1 - \\omega^2 LC)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\omega L}{R}\\right)^2\\right)$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for attenuation that will be used for all subsequent calculations.\n\nThe given frequency is $f_0 = 150\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$, so the angular frequency is:\n$$\\omega_0 = 2\\pi f_0 = 2\\pi (1.5 \\times 10^5) = 3\\pi \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$$\nThe LISN resistance is $R = 50\\,\\Omega$.\n\n**1.

Worst-Case Attenuation Analysis**\n\nTo find the minimum (worst-case) attenuation, we must minimize the argument of the logarithm, $F(L, C) = (1 - \\omega_0^2 LC)^2 + (\\omega_0 L/R)^2$. The attenuation is provided by the inductor $L$ and capacitor $C$. Intuitively, lower values of $L$ and $C$ should result in lower attenuation. A formal sensitivity analysis confirms this for the given operating point, which is well above the filter's resonant frequency.\nFor both CM and DM nominal values, the term $\\omega_0^2 LC$ is greater than $1$. In this regime, the function $F(L,C)$ is monotonically increasing with both $L$ and $C$.
