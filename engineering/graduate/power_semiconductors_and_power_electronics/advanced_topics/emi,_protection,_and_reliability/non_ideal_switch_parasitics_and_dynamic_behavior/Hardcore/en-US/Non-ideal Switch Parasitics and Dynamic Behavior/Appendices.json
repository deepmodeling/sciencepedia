The MOSFET exhibits non-ideal parasitics including a gate–drain (Miller) capacitance that results in a Miller plateau during switching.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the gate displacement current and the time duration of the Miller plateau for a switching MOSFET, based on a set of given parameters and fundamental principles.\n\nFirst, we address the required gate displacement current during the Miller plateau. The Miller plateau is a phase during the MOSFET's turn-on (or turn-off) transition where the gate-source voltage, $V_{GS}$, remains approximately constant at a value known as the Miller voltage, $V_{GS(\\text{pl})}$. During this interval, the drain-source voltage, $V_{DS}$, slews between its initial and final values.\n\nThe total current flowing into the gate terminal, $I_g$, provides charge to both the gate-source capacitance, $C_{gs}$, and the gate-drain capacitance, $C_{gd}$. This is expressed as:\n$$I_g(t) = \\frac{dQ_{gs}}{dt} + \\frac{dQ_{gd}}{dt}$$\nDuring the Miller plateau, since $V_{GS}$ is constant, the charge on $C_{gs}$ is also constant. Therefore, the current component for the gate-source capacitance is zero:\n$$\\frac{dQ_{gs}}{dt} = 0$$\nConsequently, the entire gate current is diverted to charge the gate-drain (Miller) capacitance. This current is the displacement current required to sustain the change in voltage across $C_{gd}$:\n$$I_{g, \\text{Miller}} = \\frac{dQ_{gd}}{dt}$$\nThe problem asks us to start from the fundamental relations $i=dq/dt$ and $C=dq/dv$. Using the chain rule, we can express the current in terms of capacitance and the rate of voltage change:\n$$I_{g, \\text{Miller}} = \\frac{dQ_{gd}}{dV_{GD}} \\frac{dV_{GD}}{dt}$$\nwhere $V_{GD}$ is the gate-drain voltage. The term $\\frac{dQ_{gd}}{dV_{GD}}$ is, by definition, the gate-drain capacitance, $C_{gd}(V_{GD})$, which is generally voltage-dependent.\n$$I_{g, \\text{Miller}} = C_{gd}(V_{GD}) \\frac{dV_{GD}}{dt}$$\nThe gate-drain voltage is related to the gate-source and drain-source voltages by the Kirchhoff's voltage law for the device terminals: $V_{GD} = V_{GS} - V_{DS}$. Taking the time derivative:\n$$\\frac{dV_{GD}}{dt} = \\frac{dV_{GS}}{dt} - \\frac{dV_{DS}}{dt}$$\nAs established, during the Miller plateau, $\\frac{dV_{GS}}{dt} = 0$. Thus, the rate of change of the gate-drain voltage is directly related to the rate of change of the drain-source voltage:\n$$\\frac{dV_{GD}}{dt} = - \\frac{dV_{DS}}{dt}$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the current, we get:\n$$I_{g, \\text{Miller}} = - C_{gd}(V_{GD}) \\frac{dV_{DS}}{dt}$$\nThe problem specifies a slew rate of $V_{DS}$ as $dV/dt = 50\\,\\mathrm{V/ns}$. For a turn-on event, $V_{DS}$ decreases, so $\\frac{dV_{DS}}{dt}$ is negative. The negative sign in the equation ensures that the gate current $I_{g, \\text{Miller}}$ is positive, indicating current flowing into the gate. We are interested in the magnitude of this current required to sustain the given slew rate magnitude, $\\left| \\frac{dV_{DS}}{dt} \\right|$.\n$$I_{g, \\text{Miller}} = C_{gd} \\left| \\frac{dV_{DS}}{dt} \\right|$$\nThe problem provides a standard approximation for the effective gate-drain capacitance over the voltage slew, $C_{gd,\\text{eq}}$. This value is calculated from the Miller charge, $Q_{gd}$, and the total drain voltage slew, $\\Delta V$:\n$$C_{gd,\\text{eq}} = \\frac{Q_{gd}}{\\Delta V}$$\nUsing the given values $Q_{gd} = 50\\,\\mathrm{nC}$ and $\\Delta V = 400\\,\\mathrm{V}$:\n$$C_{gd,\\text{eq}} = \\frac{50 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{C}}{400\\,\\mathrm{V}} = 0.125 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{F} = 125\\,\\mathrm{pF}$$\nNow, we can calculate the magnitude of the gate current during the Miller plateau. The given slew rate is $\\left| dV/dt \\right| = 50\\,\\mathrm{V/ns}$.\n$$I_{g, \\text{Miller}} = C_{gd,\\text{eq}} \\left| \\frac{dV}{dt} \\right| = (125 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F}) \\times (50\\,\\mathrm{V/ns}) = (125 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F}) \\times \\left( \\frac{50\\,\\mathrm{V}}{10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{s}} \\right)$$\n$$I_{g, \\text{Miller}} = 125 \\times 50 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A} = 6.25\\,\\mathrm{A}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the required gate current is $6.25\\,\\mathrm{A}$. Note that the gate driver parameters ($V_{\\text{drive}} = 12\\,\\mathrm{V}$ and $R_g = 3\\,\\Omega$) are not required for this calculation, as the problem asks for the current needed to achieve the specified slew rate, not the current that the given driver would provide.\n\nNext, we compute the time to traverse the Miller plateau, $t_{\\text{Miller}}$. This is the duration over which the drain-source voltage slews by $\\Delta V = 400\\,\\mathrm{V}$. Given a constant slew rate magnitude of $|dV/dt| = 50\\,\\mathrm{V/ns}$, the time is found by direct division:\n$$t_{\\text{Miller}} = \\frac{\\Delta V}{\\left| dV/dt \\right|} = \\frac{400\\,\\mathrm{V}}{50\\,\\mathrm{V/ns}} = 8\\,\\mathrm{ns}$$\nAs a consistency check, we can also calculate this time using the relationship between charge, current, and time, $Q = I \\cdot t$. During the plateau, the total charge supplied to the gate-drain capacitance is $Q_{gd}$, and the current is the constant Miller current $I_{g, \\text{Miller}}$.\n$$t_{\\text{Miller}} = \\frac{Q_{gd}}{I_{g, \\text{Miller}}} = \\frac{50\\,\\mathrm{nC}}{6.25\\,\\mathrm{A}} = \\frac{50 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{C}}{6.25\\,\\mathrm{C/s}} = 8 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 8\\,\\mathrm{ns}$$\nBoth methods yield the same result. The time duration, expressed to three significant figures, is $8.00\\,\\mathrm{ns}$.\n\nThe computed values are:\n- Required gate displacement current: $6.25\\,\\mathrm{A}$\n- Time to traverse the Miller plateau: $8.00\\,\\mathrm{ns}$",

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. We may therefore proceed with the derivation, evaluation, and explanation.\n\nThe fundamental relationship between incremental energy $\\mathrm{d}E$, electric potential $V$, and incremental charge $\\mathrm{d}Q$ is given as $\\mathrm{d}E = V\\,\\mathrm{d}Q$. The total energy $E$ stored in a capacitor as it is charged from a voltage of $0$ to a final voltage $V_{\\text{bus}}$ is the integral of this expression:\n$$E = \\int \\mathrm{d}E = \\int V\\,\\mathrm{d}Q$$\nFor a capacitor, capacitance $C$ is defined as the rate of change of charge $Q$ with respect to voltage $V$, which is $C(V) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}Q}{\\mathrm{d}V}$. This definition is general and applies to both linear (constant-capacitance) and nonlinear (voltage-dependent capacitance) capacitors. From this definition, we can express the incremental charge as $\\mathrm{d}Q = C(V)\\,\\mathrm{d}V$.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $\\mathrm{d}Q$ into the energy integral allows us to integrate with respect to voltage. The limits of integration correspond to the charging process, from an initial voltage of $V=0$ to a final voltage of $V=V_{\\text{bus}}$.\n$$E = \\int_{0}^{V_{\\text{bus}}} V C(V)\\,\\mathrm{d}V$$\nThe problem specifies the voltage-dependent output capacitance of the HEMT as $C(V) = \\dfrac{C_{0}}{1+V/V_{0}}$, where $C_{0}$ and $V_{0}$ are positive constants. We substitute this function into the integral for energy:\n$$E = \\int_{0}^{V_{\\text{bus}}} V \\left( \\frac{C_{0}}{1+V/V_{0}} \\right) \\mathrm{d}V$$\nTo solve this integral, we can perform a substitution. Let $x = 1+V/V_{0}$. Then $V = V_{0}(x-1)$ and $\\mathrm{d}V = V_{0}\\,\\mathrm{d}x$. We must also transform the limits of integration.\nWhen $V=0$, the new lower limit is $x = 1+0/V_{0} = 1$.\nWhen $V=V_{\\text{bus}}$, the new upper limit is $x = 1+V_{\\text{bus}}/V_{0}$.\n\nThe integral in terms of $x$ becomes:\n$$E = \\int_{1}^{1+V_{\\text{bus}}/V_{0}} V_{0}(x-1) \\left( \\frac{C_{0}}{x} \\right) (V_{0}\\,\\mathrm{d}x)$$\n$$E = C_{0}V_{0}^{2} \\int_{1}^{1+V_{\\text{bus}}/V_{0}} \\frac{x-1}{x} \\mathrm{d}x$$\nThe integrand can be simplified: $\\frac{x-1}{x} = 1 - \\frac{1}{x}$.\n$$E = C_{0}V_{0}^{2} \\int_{1}^{1+V_{\\text{bus}}/V_{0}} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\mathrm{d}x$$\nNow, we can perform the integration:\n$$E = C_{0}V_{0}^{2} \\left[ x - \\ln|x| \\right]_{1}^{1+V_{\\text{bus}}/V_{0}}$$\nSince $V_{\\text{bus}}$, $V_{0}$, and $C_{0}$ are positive, the argument of the logarithm will be positive, so the absolute value is not strictly necessary.

In that case, the integral becomes $E = C \\int_{0}^{V_{\\text{bus}}} V\\,\\mathrm{d}V = \\frac{1}{2}CV_{\\text{bus}}^{2}$.\nThe approximation $E_{\\text{approx}}$ uses the value of the capacitance at the final voltage, $C(V_{\\text{bus}})$, and treats it as if it were a constant value throughout the entire charging process.\nThe true energy is given by the integral $E = \\int_{0}^{V_{\\text{bus}}} V C(V)\\,\\mathrm{d}V$.\nThe approximation can be written as $E_{\\text{approx}} = C(V_{\\text{bus}}) \\int_{0}^{V_{\\text{bus}}} V\\,\\mathrm{d}V = \\int_{0}^{V_{\\text{bus}}} V C(V_{\\text{bus}})\\,\\mathrm{d}V$.\nThe given capacitance function $C(V) = \\frac{C_{0}}{1+V/V_{0}}$ is a monotonically decreasing function of voltage $V$ (for $V \\ge 0$). This means that for any voltage $V$ in the charging interval $[0, V_{\\text{bus}})$, the capacitance $C(V)$ is greater than the capacitance at the final voltage, $C(V_{\\text{bus}})$.\n$$C(V) > C(V_{\\text{bus}}) \\quad \\text{for} \\quad 0 \\le V < V_{\\text{bus}}$$\nThe term $V$ in the integrand is non-negative. Therefore, the integrand of the true energy, $V C(V)$, is greater than the integrand of the approximated energy, $V C(V_{\\text{bus}})$, over the entire interval of integration (except at the single point $V=V_{\\text{bus}}$ where they are equal).\n$$\\int_{0}^{V_{\\text{bus}}} V C(V)\\,\\mathrm{d}V > \\int_{0}^{V_{\\text{bus}}} V C(V_{\\text{bus}})\\,\\mathrm{d}V$$\n$$E > E_{\\text{approx}}$$\nConceptually, the approximation uses the smallest value the capacitance takes during the charging process, $C(V_{\\text{bus}})$, and applies it over the entire voltage range. The actual capacitor has a higher capacitance at lower voltages, meaning it stores more charge for each incremental volt at the beginning of the charging cycle than at the end. The approximation ignores this extra charge storage at lower voltages, leading to an underestimation of the total accumulated energy.",

Substituting this into the KVL equation yields:\n$$v_{C}(t) = R_{\\mathrm{loop}} (-i_{C}(t)) + L_{\\mathrm{stray}} \\frac{d(-i_{C}(t))}{dt}$$\n$$v_{C}(t) = -R_{\\mathrm{loop}} i_{C}(t) - L_{\\mathrm{stray}} \\frac{di_{C}(t)}{dt}$$\n\nNow, we use the constitutive relation for the capacitor, $i_{C}(t) = C_{\\mathrm{par}} \\frac{dv_{C}(t)}{dt}$, to express the equation solely in terms of $v_{C}(t)$:\n$$v_{C}(t) = -R_{\\mathrm{loop}} \\left(C_{\\mathrm{par}} \\frac{dv_{C}(t)}{dt}\\right) - L_{\\mathrm{stray}} \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(C_{\\mathrm{par}} \\frac{dv_{C}(t)}{dt}\\right)$$\n\nAssuming the components $L_{\\mathrm{stray}}$, $C_{\\mathrm{par}}$, and $R_{\\mathrm{loop}}$ are linear and time-invariant, we can rearrange the equation into the standard form for a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{stray}} C_{\\mathrm{par}} \\frac{d^2v_{C}(t)}{dt^2} + R_{\\mathrm{loop}} C_{\\mathrm{par}} \\frac{dv_{C}(t)}{dt} + v_{C}(t) = 0$$\nDividing by $L_{\\mathrm{stray}} C_{\\mathrm{par}}$ gives:\n$$\\frac{d^2v_{C}(t)}{dt^2} + \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{loop}}}{L_{\\mathrm{stray}}} \\frac{dv_{C}(t)}{dt} + \\frac{1}{L_{\\mathrm{stray}}C_{\\mathrm{par}}} v_{C}(t) = 0$$\nThis is the required homogeneous differential equation.\n\nWe compare this to the canonical form of a second-order system:\n$$\\frac{d^2x(t)}{dt^2} + 2\\zeta\\omega_{n} \\frac{dx(t)}{dt} + \\omega_{n}^2 x(t) = 0$$\nBy inspection, we can identify the undamped natural frequency $\\omega_{n}$ and the damping ratio $\\zeta$:\n$$\\omega_{n}^2 = \\frac{1}{L_{\\mathrm{stray}}C_{\\mathrm{par}}} \\implies \\omega_{n} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{L_{\\mathrm{stray}}C_{\\mathrm{par}}}}$$\n$$2\\zeta\\omega_{n} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{loop}}}{L_{\\mathrm{stray}}} \\implies \\zeta = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{loop}}}{2L_{\\mathrm{stray}}\\omega_{n}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{loop}}}{2L_{\\mathrm{stray}}} \\sqrt{L_{\\mathrm{stray}}C_{\\mathrm{par}}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{loop}}}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{par}}}{L_{\\mathrm{stray}}}}$$\nThe given parameter values are $L_{\\mathrm{stray}}=20 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{H}$, $C_{\\mathrm{par}}=200 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F}$, and $R_{\\mathrm{loop}}=50 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\Omega$.\n\nFirst, we calculate $\\omega_{n}$:\n$$\\omega_{n} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(20 \\times 10^{-9}) \\cdot (200 \\times 10^{-12})}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4000 \\times 10^{-21}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-18}}} = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 10^{-9}} = 5 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$$\nTo four significant figures, $\\omega_{n} = 5.000 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$.\n\nNext, we calculate $\\zeta$:\n$$\\zeta = \\frac{50 \\times 10^{-3}}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{200 \\times 10^{-12}}{20 \\times 10^{-9}}} = 0.025 \\sqrt{10 \\times 10^{-3}} = 0.025 \\sqrt{10^{-2}} = 0.025 \\times 10^{-1} = 0.0025$$\nTo four significant figures, $\\zeta = 0.002500$, or in standard scientific notation, $2.500 \\times 10^{-3}$.\n\nThe ringing frequency is the damped natural frequency, $\\omega_{d} = \\omega_{n}\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}$, expressed in Hertz ($f_{\\mathrm{ring}} = \\omega_d / (2\\pi)$):\n$$f_{\\mathrm{ring}} = \\frac{\\omega_{n}}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2} = \\frac{5 \\times 10^8}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{1 - (0.0025)^2} \\approx \\frac{5 \\times 10^8}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{1 - 6.25 \\times 10^{-6}}$$\n$$f_{\\mathrm{ring}} \\approx (7.957747 \\times 10^7) \\cdot \\sqrt{0.99999375} \\approx 7.957722 \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $f_{\\mathrm{ring}} = 7.958 \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\nThe amplitude of the oscillation is governed by the envelope function $\\exp(-\\alpha t)$, where the damping factor $\\alpha$ is given by $\\alpha = \\zeta\\omega_{n}$.\n$$\\alpha = \\zeta\\omega_{n} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{loop}}}{2L_{\\mathrm{stray}}} = \\frac{50 \\times 10^{-3}}{2 \\times 20 \\times 10^{-9}} = \\frac{50 \\times 10^{-3}}{40 \\times 10^{-9}} = 1.25 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\nThe e-folding decay time constant $\\tau_{\\mathrm{env}}$ is the time over which the amplitude decays by a factor of $\\exp(-1)$.
