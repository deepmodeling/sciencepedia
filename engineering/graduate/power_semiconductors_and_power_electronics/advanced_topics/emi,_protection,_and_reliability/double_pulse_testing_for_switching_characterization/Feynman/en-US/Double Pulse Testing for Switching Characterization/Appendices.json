Express the final relative error as a decimal fraction and round your answer to four significant figures. No units are required for the final answer.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for an explanation of plateau-based windowing for separating switching and conduction energy, and for a calculation of the relative error in a switching energy measurement due to improperly sized integration windows.\n\nFirst, we address the physical basis of plateau-based windowing. The total energy dissipated in a switching device like a MOSFET can be categorized into two primary components: conduction energy and switching energy. Conduction energy is the energy dissipated when the device is in a stable state, either fully on or fully off. When the MOSFET is fully on, it exhibits a low on-state resistance, resulting in a small drain-to-source voltage, $V_{\\text{on}}$, while conducting the load current, $I_{\\text{L}}$. The power dissipated is $P_{\\mathrm{cond}} = V_{\\text{on}} I_{\\text{L}}$. When the device is fully off, the current is ideally zero, so the dissipated power is also zero. These stable on and off states are referred to as \"conduction plateaus.\"\n\nSwitching energy, in contrast, is the energy dissipated exclusively during the transitions between the on and off states. During these transient intervals, both the voltage across the device, $v(t)$, and the current through it, $i(t)$, are simultaneously large and non-zero. The instantaneous power, $p(t) = v(t)i(t)$, consequently reaches a high peak during these short switching events. The total energy dissipated during a transition is the time integral of this power over the duration of the event.\n\nPlateau-based windowing is a technique designed to measure only the switching energy by carefully selecting the integration interval. The core principle is to set the start and end times of the integration, $[t_{a}, t_{b}]$, to precisely coincide with the beginning and end of the switching transient. By excluding the conduction plateaus—where the device is in a steady on-state or off-state—from the integration window, the contribution of conduction energy is eliminated from the measurement. The resulting integrated energy, $E_{\\mathrm{sw}} = \\int_{t_{\\mathrm{start\\_transient}}}^{t_{\\mathrm{end\\_transient}}} v(t)i(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t$, represents the true switching energy.\n\nNow, we proceed to compute the true total switching energy, $E_{\\mathrm{sw,total}}$, and the erroneously included conduction energy, $E_{\\mathrm{err,total}}$, based on the provided linear approximations. The total switching energy is the sum of the turn-on energy, $E_{\\mathrm{on}}$, and the turn-off energy, $E_{\\mathrm{off}}$.\n\nFor the turn-on transition, the voltage $v_{\\mathrm{on}}(t)$ falls linearly from $V_{\\text{DC}}$ to $V_{\\text{on}}$ over a duration $t_f$. Let the transient start at $t=0$. The voltage at time $t$ during this interval is given by:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{on}}(t) = V_{\\text{DC}} + \\frac{V_{\\text{on}} - V_{\\text{DC}}}{t_f} t \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\le t \\le t_f$$\nThe current is constant at $i(t) = I_{\\text{L}}$. The turn-on energy $E_{\\mathrm{on}}$ is the integral of the instantaneous power $p(t) = v_{\\mathrm{on}}(t)I_{\\text{L}}$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{on}} = \\int_{0}^{t_f} v_{\\mathrm{on}}(t) I_{\\text{L}} \\, \\mathrm{d}t = I_{\\text{L}} \\int_{0}^{t_f} \\left( V_{\\text{DC}} + \\frac{V_{\\text{on}} - V_{\\text{DC}}}{t_f} t \\right) \\mathrm{d}t$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{on}} = I_{\\text{L}} \\left[ V_{\\text{DC}}t + \\frac{V_{\\text{on}} - V_{\\text{DC}}}{t_f} \\frac{t^2}{2} \\right]_{0}^{t_f}$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{on}} = I_{\\text{L}} \\left( V_{\\text{DC}}t_f + \\frac{V_{\\text{on}} - V_{\\text{DC}}}{t_f} \\frac{t_f^2}{2} \\right) = I_{\\text{L}} \\left( V_{\\text{DC}}t_f + \\frac{(V_{\\text{on}} - V_{\\text{DC}})t_f}{2} \\right)$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{on}} = I_{\\text{L}} t_f \\left( V_{\\text{DC}} + \\frac{V_{\\text{on}}}{2} - \\frac{V_{\\text{DC}}}{2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} I_{\\text{L}} t_f (V_{\\text{DC}} + V_{\\text{on}})$$\n\nFor the turn-off transition, the voltage $v_{\\mathrm{off}}(t)$ rises linearly from $V_{\\text{on}}$ to $V_{\\text{DC}}$ over a duration $t_r$. The analysis is analogous. The voltage is:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{off}}(t) = V_{\\text{on}} + \\frac{V_{\\text{DC}} - V_{\\text{on}}}{t_r} t \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\le t \\le t_r$$\nThe turn-off energy $E_{\\mathrm{off}}$ is:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{off}} = \\int_{0}^{t_r} v_{\\mathrm{off}}(t) I_{\\text{L}} \\, \\mathrm{d}t = \\frac{1}{2} I_{\\text{L}} t_r (V_{\\text{on}} + V_{\\text{DC}})$$\n\nThe true total switching energy $E_{\\mathrm{sw,total}}$ is the sum of $E_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{off}}$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{sw,total}} = E_{\\mathrm{on}} + E_{\\mathrm{off}} = \\frac{1}{2} I_{\\text{L}} t_f (V_{\\text{DC}} + V_{\\text{on}}) + \\frac{1}{2} I_{\\text{L}} t_r (V_{\\text{on}} + V_{\\text{DC}})$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{sw,total}} = \\frac{1}{2} I_{\\text{L}} (V_{\\text{DC}} + V_{\\text{on}}) (t_f + t_r)$$\n\nNext, we calculate the erroneously included energy. The integration windows are too wide. The turn-on window overshoots by $\\delta t_{\\mathrm{on}}$ into the post-transient conduction plateau. In this plateau, the device is on, so the power is constant at $P_{\\mathrm{cond}} = V_{\\text{on}}I_{\\text{L}}$.

With a $5\\,\\text{ns}$ skew relative to $20\\,\\text{ns}$ edges, the measured energy under the linear ramp model is reduced to approximately $42\\%$ of the true value (about a $58\\%$ underestimation), making de-skew critical when edges are on the nanosecond scale.\n\nB.

Probe de-skew is a noise-reduction technique that improves signal-to-noise ratio by averaging multiple acquisitions.

The product is non-zero only during the overlap interval, which is $0 \\leq t \\leq T_{\\text{sw}}$.\n$$E_{\\text{true}} = \\int_{0}^{T_{\\text{sw}}} v(t) i(t) \\,\\mathrm{d}t$$\nSubstituting the given linear models:\n$$E_{\\text{true}} = \\int_{0}^{T_{\\text{sw}}} \\left(V_{\\text{DC}}\\frac{t}{T_{\\text{sw}}}\\right) \\left(I_0\\left(1 - \\frac{t}{T_{\\text{sw}}}\\right)\\right) \\,\\mathrm{d}t$$\n$$E_{\\text{true}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{DC}}I_0}{T_{\\text{sw}}} \\int_{0}^{T_{\\text{sw}}} \\left(t - \\frac{t^2}{T_{\\text{sw}}}\\right) \\,\\mathrm{d}t$$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$E_{\\text{true}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{DC}}I_0}{T_{\\text{sw}}} \\left[\\frac{t^2}{2} - \\frac{t^3}{3T_{\\text{sw}}}\\right]_{0}^{T_{\\text{sw}}}$$\n$$E_{\\text{true}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{DC}}I_0}{T_{\\text{sw}}} \\left(\\frac{T_{\\text{sw}}^2}{2} - \\frac{T_{\\text{sw}}^3}{3T_{\\text{sw}}}\\right) = \\frac{V_{\\text{DC}}I_0}{T_{\\text{sw}}} \\left(\\frac{T_{\\text{sw}}^2}{2} - \\frac{T_{\\text{sw}}^2}{3}\\right)$$\n$$E_{\\text{true}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{DC}}I_0}{T_{\\text{sw}}} \\left(\\frac{T_{\\text{sw}}^2}{6}\\right) = \\frac{1}{6} V_{\\text{DC}}I_0 T_{\\text{sw}}$$\nThis is the well-known formula for switching energy with linear voltage and current transitions.\n\n**2. Calculation of Measured Switching Energy ($E_{\\text{meas}}$)**\n\nThe measured energy is calculated using the measured waveforms, which include the propagation delays.\n$v_{\\text{meas}}(t) = v(t - \\tau_v) = v(t - 5\\,\\text{ns})$\n$i_{\\text{meas}}(t) = i(t - \\tau_i) = i(t - 0\\,\\text{ns}) = i(t)$\nThe relative skew is $\\tau = \\tau_v - \\tau_i = 5\\,\\text{ns}$. So, $E_{\\text{meas}}$ is the integral of $v(t - \\tau)i(t)$.\n\nThe waveforms for the integral are:\n- $i_{\\text{meas}}(t) = i(t) = I_0(1-t/T_{\\text{sw}})$ for $0 \\leq t \\leq T_{\\text{sw}}$.\n- $v_{\\text{meas}}(t) = v(t-\\tau) = V_{\\text{DC}}\\frac{t-\\tau}{T_{\\text{sw}}}$ for $0 \\leq t-\\tau \\leq T_{\\text{sw}}$, which implies $\\tau \\leq t \\leq T_{\\text{sw}}+\\tau$.\n\nThe integrand $v_{\\text{meas}}(t)i_{\\text{meas}}(t)$ is non-zero only when both functions are non-zero. The overlap interval for the measured signals is therefore from $t=\\tau$ to $t=T_{\\text{sw}}$.\n$$E_{\\text{meas}} = \\int_{\\tau}^{T_{\\text{sw}}} v_{\\text{meas}}(t) i_{\\text{meas}}(t) \\,\\mathrm{d}t$$\n$$E_{\\text{meas}} = \\int_{\\tau}^{T_{\\text{sw}}} \\left(V_{\\text{DC}}\\frac{t-\\tau}{T_{\\text{sw}}}\\right) \\left(I_0\\left(1 - \\frac{t}{T_{\\text{sw}}}\\right)\\right) \\,\\mathrm{d}t$$\nTo simplify the integral, we introduce normalized variables. Let the normalized time be $u = t/T_{\\text{sw}}$ and the normalized skew be $\\alpha = \\tau/T_{\\text{sw}}$. Then $dt = T_{\\text{sw}}\\,du$. The integration limits become $u = \\alpha$ to $u=1$.\n$$E_{\\text{meas}} = V_{\\text{DC}}I_0 \\int_{\\alpha}^{1} \\left(\\frac{uT_{\\text{sw}} - \\alpha T_{\\text{sw}}}{T_{\\text{sw}}}\\right) (1-u) \\,(T_{\\text{sw}}\\,\\mathrm{d}u)$$\n$$E_{\\text{meas}} = V_{\\text{DC}}I_0 T_{\\text{sw}} \\int_{\\alpha}^{1} (u-\\alpha)(1-u) \\,\\mathrm{d}u$$\n$$E_{\\text{meas}} = V_{\\text{DC}}I_0 T_{\\text{sw}} \\int_{\\alpha}^{1} (-u^2 + (1+\\alpha)u - \\alpha) \\,\\mathrm{d}u$$\n$$E_{\\text{meas}} = V_{\\text{DC}}I_0 T_{\\text{sw}} \\left[-\\frac{u^3}{3} + \\frac{(1+\\alpha)u^2}{2} - \\alpha u \\right]_{\\alpha}^{1}$$\nEvaluating at the limits gives:\n$$E_{\\text{meas}} = V_{\\text{DC}}I_0 T_{\\text{sw}} \\left( \\left(-\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1+\\alpha}{2} - \\alpha \\right) - \\left(-\\frac{\\alpha^3}{3} + \\frac{(1+\\alpha)\\alpha^2}{2} - \\alpha^2 \\right) \\right)$$\n$$E_{\\text{meas}} = V_{\\text{DC}}I_0 T_{\\text{sw}} \\left( \\left(\\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{\\alpha^3}{3} + \\frac{\\alpha^2}{2} + \\frac{\\alpha^3}{2} - \\alpha^2 \\right) \\right)$$\n$$E_{\\text{meas}} = V_{\\text{DC}}I_0 T_{\\text{sw}} \\left( \\left(\\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{\\alpha^3}{6} - \\frac{\\alpha^2}{2}\\right) \\right)$$\n$$E_{\\text{meas}} = V_{\\text{DC}}I_0 T_{\\text{sw}} \\left( \\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{3\\alpha}{6} + \\frac{3\\alpha^2}{6} - \\frac{\\alpha^3}{6} \\right) = \\frac{V_{\\text{DC}}I_0 T_{\\text{w}}}{6} (1 - 3\\alpha + 3\\alpha^2 - \\alpha^3)$$\nRecognizing the binomial expansion $(1-\\alpha)^3 = 1 - 3\\alpha + 3\\alpha^2 - \\alpha^3$, we get:\n$$E_{\\text{meas}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{6} V_{\\text{DC}}I_0 T_{\\text{sw}}\\right) (1-\\alpha)^3 = E_{\\text{true}}(1-\\alpha)^3$$\n\n**3. Numerical Evaluation**\n\nThe parameters are $T_{\\text{sw}} = 20\\,\\text{ns}$ and $\\tau = 5\\,\\text{ns}$.\nThe normalized skew is $\\alpha = \\frac{\\tau}{T_{\\text{sw}}} = \\frac{5\\,\\text{ns}}{20\\,\\text{ns}} = 0.25$.\nThe ratio of measured to true energy is:\n$$\\frac{E_{\\text{meas}}}{E_{\\text{true}}} = (1 - 0.25)^3 = (0.75)^3 = 0.421875$$\nThis means the measured energy is approximately $42.2\\%$ of the true energy. The error is an underestimation of $100\\% - 42.1875\\% = 57.8125\\%$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Probe de-skew is the process of compensating relative channel propagation delays so that the measured $v(t)$ and $i(t)$ waveforms are time-aligned before forming the product $v(t)\\,i(t)$. With a $5\\,\\text{ns}$ skew relative to $20\\,\\text{ns}$ edges, the measured energy under the linear ramp model is reduced to approximately $42\\%$ of the true value (about a $58\\%$ underestimation), making de-skew critical when edges are on the nanosecond scale.**\n- The definition of probe de-skew is accurate. It is the procedure for time-aligning measurement channels.\n- The quantitative analysis states the measured energy is reduced to \"approximately $42\\%$ of the true value\". Our calculation yields $42.2\\%$, which is an excellent match.\n- It states this is \"about a $58\\%$ underestimation\". Our calculation yields $57.8\\%$, which is also an excellent match.\n- The conclusion that de-skew is \"critical\" is a direct and valid consequence of the massive measurement error.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Probe de-skew primarily removes DC offsets between channels. Time alignment is not required because integrating $v(t)\\,i(t)$ over the full switching event averages out any skew; therefore, the error with a $5\\,\\text{ns}$ skew on $20\\,\\text{ns}$ edges is negligible (less than $1\\%$).**\n- The definition of de-skew is incorrect. De-skew relates to time delay, not DC offset. This confuses two distinct oscilloscope functions.\n- The claim that integration averages out skew is fundamentally false. The integral of a product of two functions, $\\int f(t)g(t-\\tau)dt$, is highly dependent on the shift $\\tau$.\n- The claim of negligible error (less than $1\\%$) is grossly incorrect. The calculated error is approximately $58\\%$.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Probe de-skew is a noise-reduction technique that improves signal-to-noise ratio by averaging multiple acquisitions. It does not affect $E_{\\text{sw}}$ because energy depends only on average voltage and current magnitudes, so even with a $5\\,\\text{ns}$ skew the measured energy equals the true energy to within a few percent.**\n- The definition of de-skew is incorrect. This describes waveform averaging, not de-skew.\n- The claim that energy depends only on average magnitudes is false. Switching energy is the integral of instantaneous power, $p(t) = v(t)i(t)$, where the temporal overlap (phasing) of $v(t)$ and $i(t)$ is paramount.\n- The claim that the measured energy is close to the true energy is false, as shown by the calculation.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Probe de-skew is optional because with linear edges the overlap error scales linearly with the fraction of skew; for $\\tau = 5\\,\\text{ns}$ and $T = 20\\,\\text{ns}$ the measured energy is about $75\\%$ of the true value (approximately a $25\\%$ underestimation), which is acceptable in most cases.**\n- The claim that the error scales linearly is false. The derived ratio is $(1-\\alpha)^3$, which is a cubic relationship.\n- The stated measured energy of $75\\%$ of the true value is incorrect. The calculation yields $42.2\\%$. The value $75\\%$ likely arises from the incorrect assumption that the energy is proportional to the overlap duration, which is $T_{sw}-\\tau = 15\\,\\text{ns}$ or $75\\%$ of $T_{sw}$.\n- An error of $25\\%$ would not be considered \"acceptable\" for characterization, and the actual error of $58\\%$ is certainly unacceptable.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
