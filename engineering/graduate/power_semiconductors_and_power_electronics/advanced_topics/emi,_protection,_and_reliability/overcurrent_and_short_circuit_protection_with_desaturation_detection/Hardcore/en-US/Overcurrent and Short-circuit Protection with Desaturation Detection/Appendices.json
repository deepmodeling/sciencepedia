The DESAT comparator has threshold $V_{th}$ referenced to the sense node. At turn-on, the blanking capacitor voltage is $0$ and the sense node voltage is the sum of the diode forward drop and the capacitor voltage.

All necessary parameters and conditions are provided to derive a unique and meaningful solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation and calculation of the blanking time, $t_b$, for an IGBT desaturation detection circuit. The derivation must start from the fundamental relationships governing charge, voltage, and current for a capacitor.\n\nThe fundamental relationship between charge $Q$, capacitance $C$, and voltage $V$ across a capacitor is given by:\n$$Q = C V$$\nThe definition of electric current $I$ is the rate of change of charge with respect to time $t$:\n$$I = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}Q}{\\mathrm{d}t}$$\nBy substituting the first equation into the second, we obtain the current-voltage relationship for a capacitor. Let $V_{C_b}(t)$ be the voltage across the blanking capacitor $C_b$ at time $t$. Then the charge on the capacitor is $Q(t) = C_b V_{C_b}(t)$. Differentiating with respect to time yields:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}Q}{\\mathrm{d}t} = C_b \\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{C_b}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}$$\nIn the given circuit, the capacitor $C_b$ is charged by a constant current source of magnitude $I_{\\text{chg}}$. Therefore, the current flowing into the capacitor is $I_{\\text{chg}}$. We can write:\n$$I_{\\text{chg}} = C_b \\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{C_b}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}$$\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation for the capacitor voltage $V_{C_b}(t)$. Since $I_{\\text{chg}}$ and $C_b$ are constants, we can separate variables and integrate to find $V_{C_b}(t)$:\n$$\\mathrm{d}V_{C_b} = \\frac{I_{\\text{chg}}}{C_b} \\mathrm{d}t$$\nWe integrate from the initial time $t=0$ to a general time $t$. The initial condition is that the capacitor voltage is zero at turn-on, so $V_{C_b}(0) = 0$.\n$$\\int_{V_{C_b}(0)}^{V_{C_b}(t)} \\mathrm{d}V'_{C_b} = \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{I_{\\text{chg}}}{C_b} \\mathrm{d}t'$$\n$$V_{C_b}(t) - V_{C_b}(0) = \\frac{I_{\\text{chg}}}{C_b} (t - 0)$$\nSubstituting $V_{C_b}(0) = 0$, we find the expression for the capacitor voltage as a function of time:\n$$V_{C_b}(t) = \\frac{I_{\\text{chg}}}{C_b} t$$\nThis result shows that the voltage across the capacitor ramps up linearly with time, which is the expected behavior for a capacitor charged by a constant current source.\n\nThe problem states that the sense node voltage, which we denote as $V_{\\text{sense}}(t)$, is the sum of the forward voltage drop of the silicon diode, $V_D$, and the voltage across the blanking capacitor, $V_{C_b}(t)$.\n$$V_{\\text{sense}}(t) = V_D + V_{C_b}(t)$$\nSubstituting our derived expression for $V_{C_b}(t)$:\n$$V_{\\text{sense}}(t) = V_D + \\frac{I_{\\text{chg}}}{C_b} t$$\nThe blanking time, $t_b$, is defined as the time interval required for the sense node voltage $V_{\\text{sense}}(t)$ to reach the comparator's threshold voltage, $V_{th}$. At $t = t_b$, we have $V_{\\text{sense}}(t_b) = V_{th}$.\n$$V_{th} = V_D + \\frac{I_{\\text{chg}}}{C_b} t_b$$\nWe can now solve this algebraic equation for $t_b$:\n$$V_{th} - V_D = \\frac{I_{\\text{chg}}}{C_b} t_b$$\n$$t_b = \\frac{C_b (V_{th} - V_D)}{I_{\\text{chg}}}$$\nThis is the derived analytical expression for the blanking time.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value for $t_b$ using the provided constants:\n$I_{\\text{chg}} = 1\\ \\text{mA} = 1 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{A}$\n$C_b = 1\\ \\text{nF} = 1 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{F}$\n$V_{th} = 7\\ \\text{V}$\n$V_D = 0.7\\ \\text{V}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $t_b$:\n$$t_b = \\frac{(1 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{F}) \\times (7\\ \\text{V} - 0.7\\ \\text{V})}{1 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{A}}$$\n$$t_b = \\frac{(1 \\times 10^{-9}) \\times (6.3)}{1 \\times 10^{-3}}\\ \\text{s}$$\n$$t_b = 6.3 \\times 10^{-9+3}\\ \\text{s}$$\n$$t_b = 6.3 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{s}$$\n\nThe problem also requires an assessment of whether this blanking interval is compatible with the device's short-circuit withstand time, $t_{sc} = 5\\ \\mu\\text{s} = 5 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{s}$.\nThe calculated blanking time is $t_b = 6.3 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{s}$. The desaturation protection is inhibited during this interval. For the protection to be effective, the fault must be detected and the gate turned off before the device is damaged. This requires the total detection and turn-off time to be less than $t_{sc}$. The blanking time is a major component of this total time.\nComparing the values, we find that $t_b > t_{sc}$.\n$$6.3 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{s} > 5 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{s}$$\nThis means that the blanking time alone is longer than the maximum time the IGBT can safely handle a short-circuit. The protection circuit will not trigger in time to prevent device failure. Therefore, the blanking interval is not compatible with the specified short-circuit withstand time; it is too long. To make the circuit compatible, the parameters ($I_{\\text{chg}}$, $C_b$, $V_{th}$) would need to be adjusted to reduce $t_b$ to a value safely below $t_{sc}$.\n\nThe final answer required is the numerical value of the blanking time in seconds.",

            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of circuit theory and power electronics, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is stated objectively.\n\nThe objective is to determine the actual collector–emitter voltage across the semiconductor die, $V_{\\text{CE,die}}$, at the instant the external desaturation detection circuit trips. The circuit measures the collector–emitter voltage at the package terminals, which we will denote as $V_{\\text{CE,meas}}$. The trip occurs when this measured voltage reaches a threshold, $V_{\\text{CE,trip}}$.\n\nLet us define the relevant electrical potentials:\n- $V_C$: The potential at the collector terminal.\n- $V_{E,pin}$: The potential at the external emitter pin of the IGBT package.\n- $V_{E,die}$: The potential at the emitter connection on the surface of the semiconductor die.\n\nThe problem states that the desaturation comparator measures the collector potential relative to the external emitter pin. Therefore, the measured voltage at the trip instant is:\n$$V_{\\text{CE,meas}} = V_C - V_{E,pin} = V_{\\text{CE,trip}} = 7 \\text{ V}$$\n\nThe quantity we need to find is the effective collector–emitter voltage at the semiconductor die, which is defined as:\n$$V_{\\text{CE,die}} = V_C - V_{E,die}$$\n\nThe difference between $V_{\\text{CE,meas}}$ and $V_{\\text{CE,die}}$ arises from the voltage drop across the parasitic inductance of the emitter lead, $L_E$. This inductance is physically located between the emitter on the die and the external emitter pin. The current flowing through this inductance is the emitter current, $i_E$. During a short-circuit event in an IGBT, the gate current is negligible compared to the collector and emitter currents, so we can make the valid approximation that the emitter current $i_E$ is equal to the collector current $i_C$. The problem gives the rate of change of the collector current, $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}i}{\\mathrm{d}t}$, which we take to be $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}i_E}{\\mathrm{d}t}$.\n\nAccording to the constitutive relation for an inductor, the voltage induced across the parasitic emitter inductance $L_E$ is given by:\n$$V_{L_E} = L_E \\frac{\\mathrm{d}i_E}{\\mathrm{d}t}$$\nThis voltage represents the potential difference between the die-side of the emitter connection and the pin-side. Since the current flows from the die to the external circuit (i.e., from the internal node $V_{E,die}$ to the external node $V_{E,pin}$), a positive $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}i_E}{\\mathrm{d}t}$ implies that the potential at the die is higher than the potential at the pin. Thus:\n$$V_{E,die} - V_{E,pin} = V_{L_E} = L_E \\frac{\\mathrm{d}i_E}{\\mathrm{d}t}$$\n\nTo find the relationship between $V_{\\text{CE,die}}$ and $V_{\\text{CE,meas}}$, we can manipulate the defined voltage expressions. Let us express $V_{\\text{CE,die}}$ in terms of $V_{\\text{CE,meas}}$.\nStarting with the definition of $V_{\\text{CE,die}}$:\n$$V_{\\text{CE,die}} = V_C - V_{E,die}$$\nWe can rewrite $V_{E,die}$ using the relationship $V_{E,die} = V_{E,pin} + L_E \\frac{\\mathrm{d}i_E}{\\mathrm{d}t}$. Substituting this gives:\n$$V_{\\text{CE,die}} = V_C - \\left(V_{E,pin} + L_E \\frac{\\mathrm{d}i_E}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\right)$$\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n$$V_{\\text{CE,die}} = (V_C - V_{E,pin}) - L_E \\frac{\\mathrm{d}i_E}{\\mathrm{d}t}$$\nWe recognize the term $(V_C - V_{E,pin})$ as the measured collector-emitter voltage, $V_{\\text{CE,meas}}$, which is equal to $V_{\\text{CE,trip}}$ at the moment of interest. Therefore:\n$$V_{\\text{CE,die}} = V_{\\text{CE,trip}} - L_E \\frac{\\mathrm{d}i_E}{\\mathrm{d}t}$$\n\nThis equation shows that the actual voltage stress on the semiconductor die is lower than the measured external voltage by an amount equal to the voltage induced across the parasitic emitter inductance. The lack of a Kelvin emitter connection forces the measurement circuit to include this inductive voltage drop.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this equation.\nThe trip threshold voltage is $V_{\\text{CE,trip}} = 7 \\text{ V}$.\nThe parasitic emitter inductance is $L_E = 5 \\text{ nH} = 5 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ H}$.\nThe rate of rise of the current is $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}i}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 200 \\text{ A}/\\mu\\text{s}$. We must convert this to base SI units:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}i_E}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{200 \\text{ A}}{1 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ s}} = 200 \\times 10^6 \\text{ A/s} = 2 \\times 10^8 \\text{ A/s}$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the voltage across the inductor, $V_{L_E}$:\n$$V_{L_E} = L_E \\frac{\\mathrm{d}i_E}{\\mathrm{d}t} = (5 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ H}) \\times (2 \\times 10^8 \\text{ A/s})$$\n$$V_{L_E} = 10 \\times 10^{-1} \\text{ V} = 1.0 \\text{ V}$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the collector-emitter voltage at the die:\n$$V_{\\text{CE,die}} = V_{\\text{CE,trip}} - V_{L_E} = 7 \\text{ V} - 1.0 \\text{ V} = 6.0 \\text{ V}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.
