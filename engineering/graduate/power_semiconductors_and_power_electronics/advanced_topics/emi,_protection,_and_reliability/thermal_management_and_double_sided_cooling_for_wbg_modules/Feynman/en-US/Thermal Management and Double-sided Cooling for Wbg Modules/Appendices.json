            "problem": "A double-sided cooled Wide Bandgap (WBG) power semiconductor half-bridge module comprises two identical switches mounted between two Direct-Bonded Copper (DBC) substrates and interfaced to top and bottom cold plates through Thermal Interface Materials (TIMs).

            "solution": "The problem statement has been analyzed and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive the requested expression from fundamental principles.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the effective junction-to-ambient thermal resistance, $R_{\\theta,\\mathrm{eff}}$, for a single power semiconductor switch cooled from both top and bottom sides. The system is modeled with two parallel thermal paths from the device junction at temperature $T_{\\mathrm{j}}$ to a common ambient at temperature $T_{\\mathrm{a}}$. The total heat dissipated by the switch is $Q$.\n\nThe concept of thermal resistance, $R_{\\theta}$, is analogous to electrical resistance and is defined for a steady heat flow $Q$ as the ratio of the temperature difference, $\\Delta T$, across a thermal path to the heat flow through it:\n$$R_{\\theta} = \\frac{\\Delta T}{Q}$$\nThe unit of thermal resistance is Kelvin per Watt, $\\mathrm{K/W}$.\n\nWe will first derive the expressions for conduction and convection thermal resistances from the fundamental laws provided.\n\n**1. Conduction Thermal Resistance**\nFor steady, one-dimensional heat conduction through a solid material, Fourier's law states that the heat flux, $q'' = Q/A$, is proportional to the temperature gradient:\n$$q'' = -k \\frac{dT}{dx}$$\nwhere $Q$ is the heat flow rate, $A$ is the cross-sectional area normal to the heat flow, $k$ is the thermal conductivity of the material, and $\\frac{dT}{dx}$ is the temperature gradient. For a planar layer of thickness $d$ with constant cross-sectional area $A$ and thermal conductivity $k$, we can integrate this equation across the thickness of the layer, from $x=0$ to $x=d$, with corresponding temperatures $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$:\n$$Q \\int_0^d dx = -kA \\int_{T_1}^{T_2} dT$$\n$$Q d = -kA (T_{2} - T_{1}) = kA (T_{1} - T_{2})$$\nThe temperature difference across the layer is $\\Delta T = T_{1} - T_{2}$. Thus,\n$$Q = \\frac{kA}{d} \\Delta T$$\nThe conduction thermal resistance, $R_{\\theta,\\mathrm{cond}}$, is therefore:\n$$R_{\\theta,\\mathrm{cond}} = \\frac{\\Delta T}{Q} = \\frac{d}{kA}$$\n\n**2. Convection Thermal Resistance**\nFor heat transfer from a solid surface to a surrounding fluid, Newton's law of cooling states:\n$$Q = hA (T_{\\mathrm{s}} - T_{\\mathrm{a}})$$\nwhere $h$ is the convective heat transfer coefficient, $A$ is the surface area, $T_{\\mathrm{s}}$ is the surface temperature, and $T_{\\mathrm{a}}$ is the ambient fluid temperature. The temperature difference driving the heat flow is $\\Delta T = T_{\\mathrm{s}} - T_{\\mathrm{a}}$.\nThe convection thermal resistance, $R_{\\theta,\\mathrm{conv}}$, is therefore:\n$$R_{\\theta,\\mathrm{conv}} = \\frac{\\Delta T}{Q} = \\frac{1}{hA}$$\n\n**3. Equivalent Thermal Network Construction**\nThe system consists of two parallel paths for heat to flow from the junction to the ambient. The total thermal resistance of each path is the sum of the series resistances within that path.\n\n**Top Path Thermal Resistance ($R_{\\theta,t}$):**\nThe top path consists of three thermal resistances in series:\n1.  The resistance of the fixed solid layers, given as $R_{s,t}$.\n2.  The conduction resistance of the top Thermal Interface Material (TIM), $R_{\\theta,\\mathrm{TIM},t}$. Using the derived formula for conduction resistance, with thickness $d_{t}$ and thermal conductivity $k_{t}$ over an area $A$:\n    $$R_{\\theta,\\mathrm{TIM},t} = \\frac{d_{t}}{k_{t} A}$$\n3.  The convection resistance from the top cold plate to the ambient, $R_{\\theta,\\mathrm{conv},t}$. Using the derived formula for convection resistance, with heat transfer coefficient $h_{t}$ over an area $A$:\n    $$R_{\\theta,\\mathrm{conv},t} = \\frac{1}{h_{t} A}$$\n\nThe total thermal resistance of the top path, $R_{\\theta,t}$, is the sum of these series components:\n$$R_{\\theta,t} = R_{s,t} + R_{\\theta,\\mathrm{TIM},t} + R_{\\theta,\\mathrm{conv},t} = R_{s,t} + \\frac{d_{t}}{k_{t} A} + \\frac{1}{h_{t} A}$$\n\n**Bottom Path Thermal Resistance ($R_{\\theta,b}$):**\nSimilarly, the bottom path consists of three thermal resistances in series:\n1.  The resistance of the fixed solid layers, given as $R_{s,b}$.\n2.  The conduction resistance of the bottom TIM, $R_{\\theta,\\mathrm{TIM},b}$, with thickness $d_{b}$ and thermal conductivity $k_{b}$ over an area $A$:\n    $$R_{\\theta,\\mathrm{TIM},b} = \\frac{d_{b}}{k_{b} A}$$\n3.  The convection resistance from the bottom cold plate to the ambient, $R_{\\theta,\\mathrm{conv},b}$, with heat transfer coefficient $h_{b}$ over an area $A$:\n    $$R_{\\theta,\\mathrm{conv},b} = \\frac{1}{h_{b} A}$$\n\nThe total thermal resistance of the bottom path, $R_{\\theta,b}$, is the sum of these series components:\n$$R_{\\theta,b} = R_{s,b} + R_{\\theta,\\mathrm{TIM},b} + R_{\\theta,\\mathrm{conv},b} = R_{s,b} + \\frac{d_{b}}{k_{b} A} + \\frac{1}{h_{b} A}$$\n\n**4. Effective Junction-to-Ambient Thermal Resistance ($R_{\\theta,\\mathrm{eff}}$)**\nThe constructed thermal network shows the junction node at temperature $T_{\\mathrm{j}}$ connected to the ambient node at temperature $T_{\\mathrm{a}}$ through two parallel branches with total resistances $R_{\\theta,t}$ and $R_{\\theta,b}$. The total heat $Q$ from the junction splits into $Q_t$ and $Q_b$ such that $Q = Q_t + Q_b$.\nThe effective junction-to-ambient thermal resistance, $R_{\\theta,\\mathrm{eff}}$, is the equivalent resistance of these two parallel resistances. The formula for the equivalent resistance of two parallel resistors is:\n$$\\frac{1}{R_{\\theta,\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\frac{1}{R_{\\theta,t}} + \\frac{1}{R_{\\theta,b}}$$\nSolving for $R_{\\theta,\\mathrm{eff}}$ yields:\n$$R_{\\theta,\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{R_{\\theta,t} R_{\\theta,b}}{R_{\\theta,t} + R_{\\theta,b}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $R_{\\theta,t}$ and $R_{\\theta,b}$ derived above, we obtain the final closed-form analytical expression for the effective junction-to-ambient thermal resistance as a function of the given parameters:\n$$R_{\\theta,\\mathrm{eff}}(d_{t},d_{b}) = \\frac{\\left( R_{s,t} + \\frac{d_{t}}{k_{t} A} + \\frac{1}{h_{t} A} \\right) \\left( R_{s,b} + \\frac{d_{b}}{k_{b} A} + \\frac{1}{h_{b} A} \\right)}{\\left( R_{s,t} + \\frac{d_{t}}{k_{t} A} + \\frac{1}{h_{t} A} \\right) + \\left( R_{s,b} + \\frac{d_{b}}{k_{b} A} + \\frac{1}{h_{b} A} \\right)}$$\nThis expression can be rearranged to group terms, but it is a complete and correct single closed-form expression as requested.\n$$R_{\\theta,\\mathrm{eff}}(d_{t},d_{b}) = \\frac{\\left( R_{s,t} + \\frac{1}{A} \\left( \\frac{d_{t}}{k_{t}} + \\frac{1}{h_{t}} \\right) \\right) \\left( R_{s,b} + \\frac{1}{A} \\left( \\frac{d_{b}}{k_{b}} + \\frac{1}{h_{b}} \\right) \\right)}{R_{s,t} + R_{s,b} + \\frac{1}{A} \\left( \\frac{d_{t}}{k_{t}} + \\frac{d_{b}}{k_{b}} + \\frac{1}{h_{t}} + \\frac{1}{h_{b}} \\right)}$$\nThis is the final answer.",

The concepts of double-sided cooling, thermal resistance, and cross-coupling in power modules are standard in the field of power electronics packaging. The provided values are physically plausible.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary data (thermal resistances, power dissipations, ambient temperature) to establish a linear system of equations. The number of equations matches the number of unknowns (the three junction temperatures), leading to a unique solution.\n- **Objective:** The problem is described using precise, technical language common in engineering, with no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\nThe problem is free from the flaws listed in the instructions. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, realistic, and well-posed.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A detailed solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Thermal Model and Solution**\n\nThe analysis begins with the fundamental principles of heat transfer at steady state. Fourier's law of one-dimensional heat conduction states that the heat flow rate, $q$, is proportional to the temperature gradient $\\frac{dT}{dx}$ and the area $A$ normal to the flow: $q = -kA \\frac{dT}{dx}$, where $k$ is the thermal conductivity. For a finite thickness $L$, this can be integrated to yield $q = \\frac{\\Delta T}{L/(kA)}$. We define the thermal resistance as $R_{th} = \\frac{L}{kA}$, which simplifies the relation to an form analogous to Ohm's Law ($V=IR$):\n$$ \\Delta T = P \\cdot R_{th} $$\nHere, the temperature difference $\\Delta T$ is analogous to voltage drop, the power dissipation $P$ (heat flow rate) is analogous to current, and $R_{th}$ is the thermal resistance. This analogy allows us to model a complex thermal system as a network of thermal resistors.\n\n**Double-Sided Cooling and Self-Resistance:**\nFor each die, the power dissipated is conducted away through two primary paths: one upwards through the top-side thermal stack to the top-side coolant, and one downwards through the substrate and baseplate to the bottom-side coolant. Since both coolant paths terminate at the same reference temperature, $T_{\\mathrm{amb}}$, these two paths are thermally in parallel. The self-heating resistance of a die, which relates its own power dissipation to its temperature rise, is the equivalent resistance of these two parallel paths. For a die $j$ (where $j \\in \\{A, B, C\\}$), the effective self-resistance $R_{jj}$ is given by:\n$$ R_{jj} = \\left( \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{top},j}} + \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{bot},j}} \\right)^{-1} = \\frac{R_{\\text{top},j} R_{\\text{bot},j}}{R_{\\text{top},j} + R_{\\text{bot},j}} $$\n\n**Linearity, Superposition, and Cross-Coupling:**\nThe heat conduction equation is linear for temperature-independent material properties. This allows us to use the principle of superposition. The total temperature rise at the junction of any given die is the linear sum of the temperature rises caused by its own power dissipation (self-heating) and the power dissipated by the other dies (cross-heating). The cross-heating occurs due to lateral heat spreading in the shared substrate.\n\nThe temperature rise of die $i$ above ambient, $\\Delta T_i = T_i - T_{\\mathrm{amb}}$, can be expressed as:\n$$ \\Delta T_i = R_{iA} P_A + R_{iB} P_B + R_{iC} P_C = \\sum_{j \\in \\{A, B, C\\}} R_{ij} P_j $$\nHere, $R_{ii}$ is the effective self-resistance calculated above, and $R_{ij}$ for $i \\neq j$ is the given cross-coupling thermal resistance, which quantifies the temperature rise at die $i$ due to a unit of power dissipated at die $j$.\n\nThis system of linear equations for all three dies is most compactly expressed in matrix form:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} \\Delta T_A \\\\ \\Delta T_B \\\\ \\Delta T_C \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} R_{AA} & R_{AB} & R_{AC} \\\\ R_{BA} & R_{BB} & R_{BC} \\\\ R_{CA} & R_{CB} & R_{CC} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} P_A \\\\ P_B \\\\ P_C \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis is denoted as $\\Delta \\mathbf{T} = \\mathbf{R}_{\\mathrm{th}} \\mathbf{P}$.\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\n\nFirst, we calculate the diagonal elements of the thermal resistance matrix $\\mathbf{R}_{\\mathrm{th}}$:\n$$ R_{AA} = \\left( \\frac{1}{0.12} + \\frac{1}{0.18} \\right)^{-1} = \\frac{0.12 \\times 0.18}{0.12 + 0.18} = \\frac{0.0216}{0.30} = 0.072\\ \\mathrm{K/W} $$\n$$ R_{BB} = \\left( \\frac{1}{0.10} + \\frac{1}{0.20} \\right)^{-1} = \\frac{0.10 \\times 0.20}{0.10 + 0.20} = \\frac{0.02}{0.30} = \\frac{1}{15} \\approx 0.06667\\ \\mathrm{K/W} $$\n$$ R_{CC} = \\left( \\frac{1}{0.11} + \\frac{1}{0.19} \\right)^{-1} = \\frac{0.11 \\times 0.19}{0.11 + 0.19} = \\frac{0.0209}{0.30} \\approx 0.06967\\ \\mathrm{K/W} $$\n\nThe full thermal resistance matrix $\\mathbf{R}_{\\mathrm{th}}$ is assembled using these self-resistances and the given cross-coupling resistances:\n$$ \\mathbf{R}_{\\mathrm{th}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.072 & 0.015 & 0.012 \\\\ 0.015 & 1/15 & 0.017 \\\\ 0.012 & 0.017 & 0.0209/0.30 \\end{pmatrix}\\ \\mathrm{K/W} $$\n\nThe power dissipation vector $\\mathbf{P}$ is:\n$$ \\mathbf{P} = \\begin{pmatrix} 180 \\\\ 120 \\\\ 90 \\end{pmatrix}\\ \\mathrm{W} $$\n\nNow, we compute the temperature rise vector $\\Delta \\mathbf{T} = \\mathbf{R}_{\\mathrm{th}} \\mathbf{P}$:\n$$ \\Delta T_A = (0.072 \\times 180) + (0.015 \\times 120) + (0.012 \\times 90) = 12.96 + 1.80 + 1.08 = 15.84\\ \\mathrm{K} $$\n$$ \\Delta T_B = (0.015 \\times 180) + \\left(\\frac{1}{15} \\times 120\\right) + (0.017 \\times 90) = 2.70 + 8.00 + 1.53 = 12.23\\ \\mathrm{K} $$\n$$ \\Delta T_C = (0.012 \\times 180) + (0.017 \\times 120) + \\left(\\frac{0.0209}{0.30} \\times 90\\right) = 2.16 + 2.04 + (0.0209 \\times 300) = 2.16 + 2.04 + 6.27 = 10.47\\ \\mathrm{K} $$\n\nThe temperature rises are $\\Delta T_A = 15.84\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, $\\Delta T_B = 12.23\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, and $\\Delta T_C = 10.47\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.

We shall start from the fundamental principles of energy conservation and heat conduction as stipulated.\n\nFirst, we determine the magnitude of the steady-state heat flux flowing through the die-attach layer. The die generates heat uniformly at a volumetric rate of $\\dot{q}_{d}$ throughout its volume. The total heat generation rate per unit area of the die is the product of the volumetric generation rate and the die thickness, $t_{d}$. This gives a total heat flux of $q''_{\\text{total}} = \\dot{q}_{d} t_{d}$. The problem states that due to symmetric double-sided cooling, this heat flux is split equally upward and downward.

The problem states to assume a one-dimensional heat flow through the thickness $t_{a}$ in this region. The temperature drop across this defective layer, $\\Delta T_{\\text{defect}}$, is:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\text{defect}} = q'' \\frac{t_{a}}{k_{v}} = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\dot{q}_{d} t_{d} \\right) \\frac{t_{a}}{k_{v}}\n$$\n\nThe additional temperature rise at the die-attach interface, located at the bottom of the die, is the difference between the temperature drop across the defective region and the nominal region. Let $T_{\\text{cp}}$ be the temperature of the cold plate surface below the attach layer. The temperature at the die bottom in the defective region is $T_{\\text{die,bot,defect}} = T_{\\text{cp}} + \\Delta T_{\\text{defect}}$, and in the nominal region it is $T_{\\text{die,bot,nominal}} = T_{\\text{cp}} + \\Delta T_{\\text{nominal}}$. The additional rise is:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\text{additional, bot}} = T_{\\text{die,bot,defect}} - T_{\\text{die,bot,nominal}} = \\Delta T_{\\text{defect}} - \\Delta T_{\\text{nominal}}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\text{additional, bot}} = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\dot{q}_{d} t_{d} \\right) \\frac{t_{a}}{k_{v}} - \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\dot{q}_{d} t_{d} \\right) \\frac{t_{a}}{k_{a}}\n$$\nFactoring out the common terms, we get:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\text{additional, bot}} = \\frac{\\dot{q}_{d} t_{d} t_{a}}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{k_{v}} - \\frac{1}{k_{a}} \\right)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the peak additional temperature rise at the die *top* surface, $\\Delta T_{\\text{peak}}$. The problem specifies that the die is sufficiently laterally conductive, so the perturbation to its in-plane temperature distribution can be neglected. This crucial assumption implies that the additional temperature rise at the bottom of the die, $\\Delta T_{\\text{additional, bot}}$, propagates vertically through the die's thickness without significant lateral spreading. Furthermore, for a plate with uniform internal heat generation and symmetric boundary conditions (equal heat flux leaving top and bottom), the temperature is symmetric about the center plane. The temperatures of the top and bottom surfaces are equal, i.e., $T_{\\text{top}} = T_{\\text{bottom}}$. Therefore, any change in the bottom surface temperature, $\\Delta T_{\\text{die,bot}}$, results in an equal change in the top surface temperature, $\\Delta T_{\\text{die,top}}$.\nThus, we can state that $\\Delta T_{\\text{peak}} = \\Delta T_{\\text{additional, bot}}$.\n\nThe final expression for the peak additional temperature rise is:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\text{peak}} = \\frac{\\dot{q}_{d} t_{d} t_{a}}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{k_{v}} - \\frac{1}{k_{a}} \\right)\n$$\nIt is worth noting that the inclusion radius, $a$, is not present in this final expression. Its purpose in the problem statement is to justify the one-dimensional heat flow assumption ($a \\gg t_{a}$).\n\nNow, we will evaluate this expression numerically using the provided parameters:\n- Die thickness $t_{d} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\text{m}$\n- Volumetric heat generation $\\dot{q}_{d} = 8.0 \\times 10^{9}\\ \\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$\n- Attach thickness $t_{a} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{m}$\n- Matrix conductivity $k_{a} = 60\\ \\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$\n- Inclusion conductivity $k_{v} = 3\\ \\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\text{peak}} = \\frac{(8.0 \\times 10^{9}\\ \\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}) \\times (2.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\text{m}) \\times (3.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{m})}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{3\\ \\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}} - \\frac{1}{60\\ \\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}} \\right)\n$$\nFirst, calculate the pre-factor:\n$$\n\\frac{(8.0 \\times 10^{9}) \\times (2.5 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times (3.0 \\times 10^{-5})}{2} = \\frac{60}{2} = 30\\ \\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\n$$\nNext, calculate the term in the parenthesis:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{60} = \\frac{20}{60} - \\frac{1}{60} = \\frac{19}{60}\\ \\text{m}\\,\\text{K}\\,\\text{W}^{-1}\n$$\nFinally, multiply the two parts:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\text{peak}} = 30\\ \\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-1} \\times \\frac{19}{60}\\ \\text{m}\\,\\text{K}\\,\\text{W}^{-1} = \\frac{19}{2}\\ \\text{K} = 9.5\\ \\text{K}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\text{peak}} = 9.500\\ \\text{K}\n$$\nThis result represents the additional temperature rise at the hottest point on the die surface directly attributable to the presence of the localized void in the die-attach material, under the simplifying assumption of one-dimensional heat flow.",
