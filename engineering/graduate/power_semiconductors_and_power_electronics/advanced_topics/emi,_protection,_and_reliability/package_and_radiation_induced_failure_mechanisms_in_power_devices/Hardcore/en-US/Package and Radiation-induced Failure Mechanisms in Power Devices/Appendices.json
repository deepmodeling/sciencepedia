            "problem": "A power semiconductor die of thickness $t$ and thermal conductivity $k$ dissipates heat uniformly at its top surface ($z=t$) with areal power density $q$ (units $\\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}$). The die has a circular footprint of radius $a$ and is ideally bonded (negligible interfacial thermal resistance) to a semi-infinite substrate ($z \\ge 0$) of thermal conductivity $k_{s}$. The substrate extends to a far field at temperature $T_{\\infty}$ as $z \\to \\infty$. Assume the bottom of the die ($z=0$) can be treated as isothermal across the footprint due to its finite thickness and high in-plane thermal conductivity, and that heat spreads into the substrate in three dimensions from the circular contact region at $z=0$.

The combination of one-dimensional conduction and three-dimensional heat spreading is a classical problem.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. The geometry, material properties, and boundary conditions are specified, allowing for the existence of a unique, stable, and meaningful solution. The assumption of an isothermal die base simplifies the problem to a tractable analytical form, which is a common and valid engineering approximation.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, objective, and standard scientific terminology. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n- **Completeness:** The problem provides all necessary variables and conditions to derive the requested expression. It is self-contained.\n- **Consistency:** The provided information and assumptions are consistent with each other. The assumption of an isothermal base, while an idealization, is explicitly stated and justified within the problem context (\"due to its finite thickness and high in-plane thermal conductivity\").\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe total steady-state temperature rise $\\Delta T$ from the far-field of the substrate to the top surface of the die can be decomposed into two components using the principle of thermal resistance superposition. Let $T_{\\text{top}}$ be the temperature at the die's top surface ($z=t$), $T_{\\text{bottom}}$ be the temperature at the die's bottom surface ($z=0$), and $T_{\\infty}$ be the far-field temperature. The total temperature rise is:\n$$\n\\Delta T = T_{\\text{top}} - T_{\\infty} = (T_{\\text{top}} - T_{\\text{bottom}}) + (T_{\\text{bottom}} - T_{\\infty})\n$$\nWe define $\\Delta T_{\\text{die}} = T_{\\text{top}} - T_{\\text{bottom}}$ as the temperature drop across the die thickness, and $\\Delta T_{\\text{sub}} = T_{\\text{bottom}} - T_{\\infty}$ as the temperature rise of the die-substrate interface relative to the far-field.\n\n**1. Temperature Drop Across the Die ($\\Delta T_{\\text{die}}$)**\nThe problem states that heat is dissipated uniformly at the top surface ($z=t$) with an areal power density $q$. This heat must conduct through the thickness $t$ of the die to reach the substrate at $z=0$. The assumption that the bottom of the die is isothermal implies that the heat flow through the die can be treated as one-dimensional in the $z$-direction.\n\nUnder steady-state, one-dimensional heat conduction, Fourier's law is:\n$$\nq_z = -k \\frac{dT}{dz}\n$$\nwhere $q_z$ is the heat flux in the $z$-direction. In our coordinate system, heat is generated at $z=t$ and flows towards $z=0$, so the heat flux is in the negative $z$-direction and its magnitude is constant and equal to $q$. Thus, $q_z = -q$.\n$$\n-q = -k \\frac{dT}{dz} \\implies \\frac{dT}{dz} = \\frac{q}{k}\n$$\nTo find the temperature difference across the die, we integrate this expression from $z=0$ to $z=t$:\n$$\n\\int_{T(0)}^{T(t)} dT = \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{q}{k} dz\n$$\nSince $q$ and $k$ are constants:\n$$\nT(t) - T(0) = \\frac{q}{k} [z]_{0}^{t}\n$$\nSubstituting $T(t) = T_{\\text{top}}$ and $T(0) = T_{\\text{bottom}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\text{die}} = T_{\\text{top}} - T_{\\text{bottom}} = \\frac{qt}{k}\n$$\nThis term represents the temperature rise due to the one-dimensional conduction thermal resistance of the die itself.\n\n**2. Temperature Rise in the Substrate ($\\Delta T_{\\text{sub}}$)**\nThe total power $P$ dissipated by the die is the areal power density $q$ multiplied by the area of the die's circular footprint, $A = \\pi a^2$.\n$$\nP = qA = q \\pi a^2\n$$\nThis power flows from the circular contact area at $z=0$ into the semi-infinite substrate. The problem specifies that this interface at $z=0$ is to be treated as isothermal. The temperature rise of an isothermal circular disk of radius $a$ on the surface of a semi-infinite medium with thermal conductivity $k_s$ relative to the far-field temperature is given by $\\Delta T_{\\text{sub}} = P \\cdot R_{\\text{spread}}$, where $R_{\\text{spread}}$ is the thermal spreading resistance.\n\nFor this specific geometry and boundary condition (isothermal circular source on a semi-infinite medium), the spreading resistance is a standard result from heat transfer theory:\n$$\nR_{\\text{spread}} = \\frac{1}{4 k_s a}\n$$\nTherefore, the temperature rise at the interface is:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\text{sub}} = P \\cdot R_{\\text{spread}} = (q \\pi a^2) \\left(\\frac{1}{4 k_s a}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\text{sub}} = \\frac{q \\pi a}{4 k_s}\n$$\n\n**3. Total Temperature Rise ($\\Delta T$)**\nThe total temperature rise is the sum of the two components:\n$$\n\\Delta T = \\Delta T_{\\text{die}} + \\Delta T_{\\text{sub}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above:\n$$\n\\Delta T = \\frac{qt}{k} + \\frac{q \\pi a}{4 k_s}\n$$\nFactoring out the areal power density $q$, we obtain the final closed-form expression:\n$$\n\\Delta T = q \\left( \\frac{t}{k} + \\frac{\\pi a}{4 k_s} \\right)\n$$\nThis expression explicitly accounts for both the through-thickness conduction in the die (first term) and the thermal spreading resistance into the semi-infinite substrate (second term), as requested.",

The use of an effective medium approximation to model the thermal conductivity of a composite material (metal with voids) is a standard and scientifically valid approach in materials science. The materials, dimensions, and power levels are realistic for high-power SiC devices.\n-   **Well-Posedness:** The problem provides all necessary data to calculate the thermal resistances of the die-attach layers and subsequently the temperature difference. The instruction to use \"a well-tested effective medium approximation\" directs the solver to a class of standard models, such as the Maxwell-Eucken model, which is appropriate for the described geometry (dilute spherical inclusions). The assumptions of 1D heat flow and constant boundary conditions make the problem uniquely solvable.\n-   **Objectivity:** The problem is stated using precise, quantitative language, free from subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe analysis begins with Fourier's law of one-dimensional heat conduction, which states that heat flux, $q''$ (power per unit area), is proportional to the temperature gradient:\n$$ q'' = -k \\frac{dT}{dx} $$\nFor a constant power dissipation $P$ over a uniform area $A$, the heat flux is $q'' = P/A$. For a layer of thickness $t$ with constant thermal conductivity $k$, integrating Fourier's law across the layer gives the temperature drop $\\Delta T$ across it:\n$$ \\Delta T = q'' \\frac{t}{k} = \\frac{P t}{k A} $$\nThis relationship defines the thermal resistance of the layer, $R_{th}$, as $R_{th} = t / (kA)$, such that $\\Delta T = P \\cdot R_{th}$.\n\nThe die-attach layers are composites containing non-conducting voids. Their effective thermal conductivity, $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, must be calculated. The problem specifies spherical voids in a continuous matrix, for which the Maxwell-Eucken effective medium approximation is appropriate. For a matrix with thermal conductivity $k_m$ and a volume fraction $\\phi$ of inclusions with thermal conductivity $k_p$, the model is:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{eff}} = k_m \\frac{k_p + 2k_m - 2\\phi(k_m - k_p)}{k_p + 2k_m + \\phi(k_m - k_p)} $$\nFor non-conducting voids, we take the limit as $k_p \\to 0$, which simplifies the expression to:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(\\phi, k_m) = k_m \\frac{2k_m - 2\\phi k_m}{2k_m + \\phi k_m} = k_m \\frac{1-\\phi}{1+\\frac{\\phi}{2}} $$\nWe apply this model to both the solder and silver sinter layers.\n\nThe thermal resistance for the solder attach, $R_{th,s}$, is:\n$$ R_{th,s} = \\frac{t_s}{k_{\\mathrm{eff},s} A} = \\frac{t_s}{A \\left( k_{s,m} \\frac{1-\\phi_s}{1+\\frac{\\phi_s}{2}} \\right)} = \\frac{t_s}{A k_{s,m}} \\frac{1+\\frac{\\phi_s}{2}}{1-\\phi_s} $$\nThe thermal resistance for the silver sinter attach, $R_{th,Ag}$, is:\n$$ R_{th,Ag} = \\frac{t_{Ag}}{k_{\\mathrm{eff},Ag} A} = \\frac{t_{Ag}}{A \\left( k_{Ag,m} \\frac{1-\\phi_{Ag}}{1+\\frac{\\phi_{Ag}}{2}} \\right)} = \\frac{t_{Ag}}{A k_{Ag,m}} \\frac{1+\\frac{\\phi_{Ag}}{2}}{1-\\phi_{Ag}} $$\nThe problem states that all other layers and boundary conditions are fixed. Therefore, the peak junction temperature for the solder case, $T_{j,s}$, and the silver case, $T_{j,Ag}$, can be written as $T_{j,s} = T_{base} + \\Delta T_s$ and $T_{j,Ag} = T_{base} + \\Delta T_{Ag}$, where $T_{base}$ is the temperature at the bottom of the die-attach layer (assumed to be the same for both cases), and $\\Delta T_s = P \\cdot R_{th,s}$ and $\\Delta T_{Ag} = P \\cdot R_{th,Ag}$ are the temperature drops across the respective attach layers.\n\nThe reduction in peak junction temperature, $\\Delta T_{j,\\mathrm{red}}$, is the difference:\n$$ \\Delta T_{j,\\mathrm{red}} = T_{j,s} - T_{j,Ag} = (T_{base} + \\Delta T_s) - (T_{base} + \\Delta T_{Ag}) = \\Delta T_s - \\Delta T_{Ag} $$\n$$ \\Delta T_{j,\\mathrm{red}} = P(R_{th,s} - R_{th,Ag}) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for thermal resistance yields the desired symbolic expression:\n$$ \\Delta T_{j,\\mathrm{red}} = \\frac{P}{A} \\left[ \\frac{t_s}{k_{s,m}} \\frac{1+\\frac{\\phi_s}{2}}{1-\\phi_s} - \\frac{t_{Ag}}{k_{Ag,m}} \\frac{1+\\frac{\\phi_{Ag}}{2}}{1-\\phi_{Ag}} \\right] $$\nNext, we evaluate the local sensitivity of $\\Delta T_{j,\\mathrm{red}}$ to the silver layer void fraction, $\\phi_{Ag}$. This is given by the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial (\\Delta T_{j,\\mathrm{red}})}{\\partial \\phi_{Ag}}$. The first term in the expression for $\\Delta T_{j,\\mathrm{red}}$ is constant with respect to $\\phi_{Ag}$.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial (\\Delta T_{j,\\mathrm{red}})}{\\partial \\phi_{Ag}} = -\\frac{P t_{Ag}}{A k_{Ag,m}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi_{Ag}} \\left( \\frac{1+\\frac{\\phi_{Ag}}{2}}{1-\\phi_{Ag}} \\right) $$\nUsing the quotient rule, where $u = 1+\\phi_{Ag}/2$ and $v = 1-\\phi_{Ag}$, we have $u' = 1/2$ and $v' = -1$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi_{Ag}} \\left( \\frac{u}{v} \\right) = \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2} = \\frac{(\\frac{1}{2})(1-\\phi_{Ag}) - (1+\\frac{\\phi_{Ag}}{2})(-1)}{(1-\\phi_{Ag})^2} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\phi_{Ag} + 1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\phi_{Ag}}{(1-\\phi_{Ag})^2} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2}}{(1-\\phi_{Ag})^2} $$\nThe sensitivity is therefore:\n$$ S_{\\phi_{Ag}} = \\frac{\\partial (\\Delta T_{j,\\mathrm{red}})}{\\partial \\phi_{Ag}} = -\\frac{P t_{Ag}}{A k_{Ag,m}} \\frac{\\frac{3}{2}}{(1-\\phi_{Ag})^2} = -\\frac{3 P t_{Ag}}{2 A k_{Ag,m} (1-\\phi_{Ag})^2} $$\nNow, we evaluate this sensitivity at $\\phi_{Ag} = 0.15$, using SI units: $P=200 \\ \\mathrm{W}$, $A=25 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m}^2$, $t_{Ag}=25 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $k_{Ag,m}=250 \\ \\mathrm{W \\ m^{-1} \\ K^{-1}}$.\n$$ S_{\\phi_{Ag}} = -\\frac{3(200)(25 \\times 10^{-6})}{2(25 \\times 10^{-6})(250)(1-0.15)^2} = -\\frac{3(200)}{2(250)(0.85)^2} = -\\frac{600}{500(0.7225)} = -\\frac{1.2}{0.7225} \\approx -1.6609 \\ \\mathrm{K} $$\nThe sensitivity has units of kelvin per unit void fraction.\n**Interpretation:** The negative sign of the sensitivity indicates that as the void fraction $\\phi_{Ag}$ in the silver layer increases, the temperature reduction $\\Delta T_{j,\\mathrm{red}}$ decreases. This occurs because increased porosity degrades the thermal conductivity of the silver layer, increasing its thermal resistance and thus raising the junction temperature $T_{j,Ag}$. This brings the performance of the silver attach closer to that of the solder, thereby reducing the net benefit of the switch. The magnitude, approximately $-1.66 \\ \\mathrm{K}$ per unit fraction, quantifies this degradation. For every $0.01$ increase in porosity (e.g., from $15\\%$ to $16\\%$), the thermal benefit $\\Delta T_{j,\\mathrm{red}}$ is reduced by about $0.0166 \\ \\mathrm{K}$. In the context of radiation-induced failure, this means that damage causing porosity growth directly translates to a higher operating temperature, which in turn can accelerate other temperature-dependent failure mechanisms.\n\nFinally, we perform the numerical calculation for $\\Delta T_{j,\\mathrm{red}}$ using the provided values in SI units.\n-   $A = 25 \\ \\mathrm{mm}^2 = 25 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m}^2$\n-   $t_s = 80 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} = 80 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m}$\n-   $t_{Ag} = 25 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} = 25 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m}$\n\nThe term for the solder attach's specific thermal resistance is:\n$$ \\frac{t_s}{k_{s,m}} \\frac{1+\\frac{\\phi_s}{2}}{1-\\phi_s} = \\frac{80 \\times 10^{-6}}{58} \\frac{1+\\frac{0.03}{2}}{1-0.03} = \\frac{80 \\times 10^{-6}}{58} \\frac{1.015}{0.97} \\approx 1.44320 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m^2 K W^{-1}} $$\nThe term for the silver sinter attach's specific thermal resistance is:\n$$ \\frac{t_{Ag}}{k_{Ag,m}} \\frac{1+\\frac{\\phi_{Ag}}{2}}{1-\\phi_{Ag}} = \\frac{25 \\times 10^{-6}}{250} \\frac{1+\\frac{0.15}{2}}{1-0.15} = \\frac{25 \\times 10^{-6}}{250} \\frac{1.075}{0.85} \\approx 0.12647 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m^2 K W^{-1}} $$\nThe heat flux is $P/A = 200 / (25 \\times 10^{-6}) = 8 \\times 10^6 \\ \\mathrm{W m^{-2}}$.\n$$ \\Delta T_{j,\\mathrm{red}} = (8 \\times 10^6 \\ \\mathrm{W m^{-2}}) \\left( 1.44320 \\times 10^{-6} - 0.12647 \\times 10^{-6} \\right) \\ \\mathrm{m^2 K W^{-1}} $$\n$$ \\Delta T_{j,\\mathrm{red}} = 8 \\times 10^6 \\times (1.31673 \\times 10^{-6}) \\ \\mathrm{K} = 10.53384 \\ \\mathrm{K} $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $10.53 \\ \\mathrm{K}$.",

For a density $N_t$ of recombination centers with capture cross-section $\\sigma_d$ and carrier thermal velocity $v_{\\text{th}}$, the SRH lifetime is:\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{rad}} = \\frac{1}{N_t \\sigma_d v_{\\text{th}}} $$\nThe density of recombination centers, $N_t$, is given as being proportional to the neutron fluence, $\\Phi$, through an introduction rate, $g_d$:\n$$ N_t = g_d \\Phi $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\tau_{\\text{rad}}$ gives:\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{rad}} = \\frac{1}{g_d \\Phi \\sigma_d v_{\\text{th}}} $$\nNow we can compute the value of $\\tau_{\\text{rad}}$. The parameters are:\n- $\\Phi = 2.0 \\times 10^{12} \\ \\text{cm}^{-2}$\n- $g_d = 0.40 \\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$\n- $\\sigma_d = 1.50 \\times 10^{-14} \\ \\text{cm}^{2}$\n- $v_{\\text{th}} = 1.00 \\times 10^{7} \\ \\text{cm/s}$\n\nThe inverse of the radiation-induced lifetime is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\text{rad}}} = (0.40 \\ \\text{cm}^{-1})(2.0 \\times 10^{12} \\ \\text{cm}^{-2})(1.50 \\times 10^{-14} \\ \\text{cm}^{2})(1.00 \\times 10^{7} \\ \\text{cm/s}) $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\text{rad}}} = 1.2 \\times 10^5 \\ \\text{s}^{-1} $$\nThe pre-irradiation lifetime is $\\tau_0 = 8 \\ \\mu\\text{s} = 8 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{s}$. The corresponding recombination rate is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\tau_0} = \\frac{1}{8 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{s}} = 1.25 \\times 10^5 \\ \\text{s}^{-1} $$\nThe total post-irradiation recombination rate is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\text{eff}}} = (1.25 \\times 10^5 + 1.2 \\times 10^5) \\ \\text{s}^{-1} = 2.45 \\times 10^5 \\ \\text{s}^{-1} $$\nThe post-irradiation effective lifetime is therefore:\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{1}{2.45 \\times 10^5 \\ \\text{s}^{-1}} \\approx 4.08163 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{s} $$\n\n**2. Tail-Current Dynamics**\n\nDuring the on-state, the steady-state collector current $I_C$ sustains the stored charge $Q_0$ in the drift region against recombination. Under the assumption of high-level injection and uniform charge distribution, the relationship is:\n$$ I_C = \\frac{Q_0}{\\tau_{\\text{eff}}} $$\nDuring turn-off, after the initial rapid fall of current through the MOSFET channel, the remaining stored charge $Q(t)$ decays solely through recombination. The continuity equation for the total charge is:\n$$ \\frac{dQ(t)}{dt} = -\\frac{Q(t)}{\\tau_{\\text{eff}}} $$\nThe initial condition at the start of the current tail ($t=0$) is $Q(0) = Q_0 = I_C \\tau_{\\text{eff}}$. The solution to this differential equation is an exponential decay:\n$$ Q(t) = Q_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\text{eff}}}\\right) $$\nThe tail current, $i_{\\text{tail}}(t)$, is the recombination current, which is the rate at which charge is removed from the drift region:\n$$ i_{\\text{tail}}(t) = \\frac{Q(t)}{\\tau_{\\text{eff}}} = \\frac{Q_0}{\\tau_{\\text{eff}}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\text{eff}}}\\right) $$\nSubstituting $I_C = Q_0 / \\tau_{\\text{eff}}$, we obtain the classic expression for the tail current:\n$$ i_{\\text{tail}}(t) = I_C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\text{eff}}}\\right) $$\n\n**3. Calculation of Tail Current at $t_1 = 10 \\ \\mu\\text{s}$**\n\nWe use the derived expression for $i_{\\text{tail}}(t)$ with the given parameters:\n- $I_C = 50 \\ \\text{A}$\n- $t_1 = 10 \\ \\mu\\text{s} = 10 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{s}$\n- $\\tau_{\\text{eff}} \\approx 4.08163 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{s}$\n\nThe exponential term's argument is:\n$$ \\frac{t_1}{\\tau_{\\text{eff}}} = \\frac{10 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{s}}{1/(2.45 \\times 10^5 \\ \\text{s}^{-1})} = (10 \\times 10^{-6})(2.45 \\times 10^5) = 2.45 $$\nThe tail current at $t=t_1$ is:\n$$ i_{\\text{tail}}(t_1) = 50 \\ \\text{A} \\times \\exp(-2.45) $$\n$$ i_{\\text{tail}}(t_1) \\approx 50 \\times 0.0862933 = 4.314665 \\ \\text{A} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the tail current is $4.315 \\ \\text{A}$.\n\n**4. Calculation of Turn-Off Tail Energy**\n\nThe problem states that the device voltage recovers to a constant $V_{\\text{DC}}$ during the tail phase. The instantaneous power dissipated during this phase is $p(t) = V_{\\text{DC}} \\cdot i_{\\text{tail}}(t)$. The total energy dissipated during the tail, $E_{\\text{off,tail}}$, is the integral of this power from the start of the tail ($t=0$) until the current fully decays ($t \\to \\infty$):\n$$ E_{\\text{off,tail}} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} p(t) \\,dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} V_{\\text{DC}} \\cdot i_{\\text{tail}}(t) \\,dt $$\n$$ E_{\\text{off,tail}} = V_{\\text{DC}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} I_C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\text{eff}}}\\right) \\,dt $$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$ E_{\\text{off,tail}} = V_{\\text{DC}} I_C \\left[ -\\tau_{\\text{eff}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\text{eff}}}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} $$\n$$ E_{\\text{off,tail}} = V_{\\text{DC}} I_C \\left[ 0 - (-\\tau_{\\text{eff}} \\cdot 1) \\right] = V_{\\text{DC}} I_C \\tau_{\\text{eff}} $$\nThis result can also be interpreted as the energy required to dissipate the initial stored charge $Q_0 = I_C \\tau_{\\text{eff}}$ across the constant voltage $V_{\\text{DC}}$, i.e., $E_{\\text{off,tail}} = V_{\\text{DC}} Q_0$.\n\nUsing the given and calculated values:\n- $V_{\\text{DC}} = 600 \\ \\text{V}$\n- $I_C = 50 \\ \\text{A}$\n- $\\tau_{\\text{eff}} \\approx 4.08163 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{s}$\n\n$$ E_{\\text{off,tail}} = (600 \\ \\text{V})(50 \\ \\text{A})(4.08163 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{s}) $$\n$$ E_{\\text{off,tail}} = 30000 \\times 4.08163 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{J} = 0.1224489 \\ \\text{J} $$\nThe problem asks for the energy in millijoules (mJ):\n$$ E_{\\text{off,tail}} = 122.4489 \\ \\text{mJ} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the turn-off tail energy is $122.4 \\ \\text{mJ}$.\n\nThe final results are:\n- Post-irradiation tail current at $t_1 = 10 \\ \\mu\\text{s}$: $4.315 \\ \\text{A}$\n- Post-irradiation turn-off tail energy: $122.4 \\ \\text{mJ}$",
