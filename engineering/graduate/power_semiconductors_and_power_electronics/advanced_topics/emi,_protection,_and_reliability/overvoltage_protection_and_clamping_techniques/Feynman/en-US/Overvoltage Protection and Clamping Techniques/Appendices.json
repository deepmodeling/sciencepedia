The provided values for inductance ($L=50\\,\\mu\\text{H}$) and avalanche energy rating ($E_{\\text{AS}}=300\\,\\text{mJ}$) are realistic for commercial power devices. The problem is self-contained, with sufficient information to derive the requested condition and calculate the maximum current. The language is precise and objective. There are no scientific flaws, contradictions, or ambiguities. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe core principle governing this Unclamped Inductive Switching (UIS) event is the conservation of energy. The energy initially stored in the magnetic field of the inductor must be entirely dissipated within the MOSFET, as there are no other dissipative elements (like series resistance) and no additional energy is supplied from the source during the event. The MOSFET must be able to withstand this energy dissipation without failing.\n\nThe energy, $E_L$, stored in an inductor with inductance $L$ carrying a current $I_0$ is given by the fundamental relation:\n$$\nE_L = \\frac{1}{2} L I_0^2\n$$\nWhen the MOSFET is turned off, the inductor current cannot change instantaneously. It forces a path through the MOSFET, causing the drain-source voltage, $V_{\\text{ds}}$, to rise until it reaches the device's avalanche breakdown voltage, $V_{\\text{av}}$. At this point, the MOSFET's body diode enters avalanche breakdown and clamps the voltage at this nearly constant level, providing a path for the inductor current to flow. The current then decays as the inductor's stored energy is converted into heat within the MOSFET.\n\nThe instantaneous power, $P(t)$, dissipated by the MOSFET during the avalanche period is the product of the voltage across it and the current through it:\n$$\nP(t) = V_{\\text{ds}}(t) \\cdot i_D(t)\n$$\nUnder the problem's stated conditions, the drain-source voltage is constant at the avalanche voltage, $V_{\\text{ds}}(t) = V_{\\text{av}}$, and the drain current, $i_D(t)$, is equal to the inductor current, $i_L(t)$. Thus,\n$$\nP(t) = V_{\\text{av}} i_L(t)\n$$\nThe total energy dissipated by the MOSFET, which we denote as $E_{\\text{diss}}$, is the time integral of this power over the duration of the avalanche event, from $t=0$ to $t=t_{\\text{av}}$ (the time it takes for the current to decay to zero):\n$$\nE_{\\text{diss}} = \\int_{0}^{t_{\\text{av}}} P(t) dt = \\int_{0}^{t_{\\text{av}}} V_{\\text{av}} i_L(t) dt\n$$\nTo evaluate this integral, we must first determine the behavior of the inductor current $i_L(t)$. According to Kirchhoff's voltage law for the loop containing the inductor and the MOSFET, the voltage across the inductor, $V_L$, is equal to $-V_{\\text{av}}$ (since the supply is disconnected and resistance is negligible). The fundamental circuit law for an inductor is $V_L = L \\frac{di_L}{dt}$. Therefore:\n$$\nL \\frac{di_L}{dt} = -V_{\\text{av}}\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation. Separating variables and integrating from the initial condition $i_L(0) = I_0$:\n$$\ndi_L = -\\frac{V_{\\text{av}}}{L} dt\n$$\n$$\n\\int_{I_0}^{i_L(t)} dI = \\int_{0}^{t} -\\frac{V_{\\text{av}}}{L} d\\tau\n$$\n$$\ni_L(t) - I_0 = -\\frac{V_{\\text{av}}}{L} t\n$$\n$$\ni_L(t) = I_0 - \\frac{V_{\\text{av}}}{L} t\n$$\nThis result shows that the inductor current decays linearly to zero. The avalanche event ends when $i_L(t_{\\text{av}}) = 0$, which allows us to find the duration $t_{\\text{av}}$:\n$$\n0 = I_0 - \\frac{V_{\\text{av}}}{L} t_{\\text{av}} \\implies t_{\\text{av}} = \\frac{L I_0}{V_{\\text{av}}}\n$$\nNow, we can formally calculate the dissipated energy, $E_{\\text{diss}}$, by substituting the expression for $i_L(t)$ into the energy integral:\n$$\nE_{\\text{diss}} = \\int_{0}^{t_{\\text{av}}} V_{\\text{av}} \\left(I_0 - \\frac{V_{\\text{av}}}{L} t\\right) dt\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\text{diss}} = V_{\\text{av}} \\left[ I_0 t - \\frac{V_{\\text{av}}}{2L} t^2 \\right]_{0}^{t_{\\text{av}}} = V_{\\text{av}} \\left( I_0 t_{\\text{av}} - \\frac{V_{\\text{av}}}{2L} t_{\\text{av}}^2 \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting $t_{\\text{av}} = \\frac{L I_0}{V_{\\text{av}}}$:\n$$\nE_{\\text{diss}} = V_{\\text{av}} \\left( I_0 \\left(\\frac{L I_0}{V_{\\text{av}}}\\right) - \\frac{V_{\\text{av}}}{2L} \\left(\\frac{L I_0}{V_{\\text{av}}}\\right)^2 \\right)\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\text{diss}} = V_{\\text{av}} \\left( \\frac{L I_0^2}{V_{\\text{av}}} - \\frac{V_{\\text{av}}}{2L} \\frac{L^2 I_0^2}{V_{\\text{av}}^2} \\right) = V_{\\text{av}} \\left( \\frac{L I_0^2}{V_{\\text{av}}} - \\frac{L I_0^2}{2V_{\\text{av}}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\text{diss}} = V_{\\text{av}} \\left( \\frac{L I_0^2}{2V_{\\text{av}}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} L I_0^2\n$$\nThis derivation confirms that the total energy dissipated in the MOSFET during the avalanche event is precisely equal to the energy initially stored in the inductor.\n\nThe condition for the MOSFET to survive the UIS event is that the energy it dissipates, $E_{\\text{diss}}$, must not exceed its single-pulse avalanche energy rating, $E_{\\text{AS}}$. Therefore, the condition is:\n$$\nE_{\\text{diss}} \\le E_{\\text{AS}}\n$$\nSubstituting our derived expression for $E_{\\text{diss}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} L I_0^2 \\le E_{\\text{AS}}\n$$\nThis is the required condition.

            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard engineering problem in power electronics concerning the design of an R-C snubber. The physical model, a series RLC circuit, is a valid and fundamental representation of the turn-off transient in a hard-switched converter leg. All necessary parameters ($L_p$, $C_s$, $I_{\\text{sw}}$, $f_s$) are provided, and their values are physically realistic. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe circuit to be analyzed is a series RLC circuit formed by the leakage inductance $L_p$, the snubber resistance $R_s$, and the snubber capacitance $C_s$. At the instant of turn-off, the current $I_{\\text{sw}}$ flowing through the inductor $L_p$ is diverted into the snubber network. The behavior of the circuit is described by a second-order linear differential equation.\n\nApplying Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) to the series $L_p$-$R_s$-$C_s$ loop, we have:\n$$ v_L(t) + v_R(t) + v_C(t) = 0 $$\nwhere $v_L(t) = L_p \\frac{di(t)}{dt}$ is the inductor voltage, $v_R(t) = R_s i(t)$ is the resistor voltage, and $v_C(t)$ is the capacitor voltage. The current $i(t)$ flowing through the series elements is related to the capacitor voltage by $i(t) = C_s \\frac{dv_C(t)}{dt}$. Differentiating this relationship gives $\\frac{di(t)}{dt} = C_s \\frac{d^2v_C(t)}{dt^2}$. Substituting these expressions into the KVL equation yields the governing differential equation for the capacitor voltage:\n$$ L_p C_s \\frac{d^2v_C(t)}{dt^2} + R_s C_s \\frac{dv_C(t)}{dt} + v_C(t) = 0 $$\nThe characteristic equation of this system is obtained by assuming a solution of the form $e^{st}$ and substituting it into the differential equation:\n$$ L_p C_s s^2 + R_s C_s s + 1 = 0 $$\nTo match the canonical form of a second-order linear system, we divide by $L_p C_s$:\n$$ s^2 + \\frac{R_s}{L_p} s + \\frac{1}{L_p C_s} = 0 $$\nThe canonical form is given by:\n$$ s^2 + 2\\zeta\\omega_n s + \\omega_n^2 = 0 $$\nwhere $\\omega_n$ is the undamped natural frequency and $\\zeta$ is the damping ratio.

The energy stored in the inductor $L_p$ carrying current $I_{\\text{sw}}$ is:\n$$ E_L = \\frac{1}{2} L_p I_{\\text{sw}}^2 $$\nThis amount of energy is dissipated in the snubber resistor $R_s$ during each switching cycle.
