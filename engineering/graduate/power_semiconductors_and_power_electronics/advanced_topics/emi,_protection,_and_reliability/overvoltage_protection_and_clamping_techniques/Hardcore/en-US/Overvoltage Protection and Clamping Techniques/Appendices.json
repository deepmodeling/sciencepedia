The scenario is based on fundamental principles of electromagnetism (energy stored in an inductor) and semiconductor physics (avalanche breakdown). The provided values for inductance ($L=50\\,\\mu\\text{H}$) and avalanche energy rating ($E_{\\text{AS}}=300\\,\\text{mJ}$) are realistic for commercial power devices. The problem is self-contained, with sufficient information to derive the requested condition and calculate the maximum current. The language is precise and objective. There are no scientific flaws, contradictions, or ambiguities. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe core principle governing this Unclamped Inductive Switching (UIS) event is the conservation of energy. The energy initially stored in the magnetic field of the inductor must be entirely dissipated within the MOSFET, as there are no other dissipative elements (like series resistance) and no additional energy is supplied from the source during the event. The MOSFET must be able to withstand this energy dissipation without failing.\n\nThe energy, $E_L$, stored in an inductor with inductance $L$ carrying a current $I_0$ is given by the fundamental relation:\n$$\nE_L = \\frac{1}{2} L I_0^2\n$$\nWhen the MOSFET is turned off, the inductor current cannot change instantaneously. It forces a path through the MOSFET, causing the drain-source voltage, $V_{\\text{ds}}$, to rise until it reaches the device's avalanche breakdown voltage, $V_{\\text{av}}$. At this point, the MOSFET's body diode enters avalanche breakdown and clamps the voltage at this nearly constant level, providing a path for the inductor current to flow. The current then decays as the inductor's stored energy is converted into heat within the MOSFET.\n\nThe instantaneous power, $P(t)$, dissipated by the MOSFET during the avalanche period is the product of the voltage across it and the current through it:\n$$\nP(t) = V_{\\text{ds}}(t) \\cdot i_D(t)\n$$\nUnder the problem's stated conditions, the drain-source voltage is constant at the avalanche voltage, $V_{\\text{ds}}(t) = V_{\\text{av}}$, and the drain current, $i_D(t)$, is equal to the inductor current, $i_L(t)$. Thus,\n$$\nP(t) = V_{\\text{av}} i_L(t)\n$$\nThe total energy dissipated by the MOSFET, which we denote as $E_{\\text{diss}}$, is the time integral of this power over the duration of the avalanche event, from $t=0$ to $t=t_{\\text{av}}$ (the time it takes for the current to decay to zero):\n$$\nE_{\\text{diss}} = \\int_{0}^{t_{\\text{av}}} P(t) dt = \\int_{0}^{t_{\\text{av}}} V_{\\text{av}} i_L(t) dt\n$$\nTo evaluate this integral, we must first determine the behavior of the inductor current $i_L(t)$. According to Kirchhoff's voltage law for the loop containing the inductor and the MOSFET, the voltage across the inductor, $V_L$, is equal to $-V_{\\text{av}}$ (since the supply is disconnected and resistance is negligible). The fundamental circuit law for an inductor is $V_L = L \\frac{di_L}{dt}$. Therefore:\n$$\nL \\frac{di_L}{dt} = -V_{\\text{av}}\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation. Separating variables and integrating from the initial condition $i_L(0) = I_0$:\n$$\ndi_L = -\\frac{V_{\\text{av}}}{L} dt\n$$\n$$\n\\int_{I_0}^{i_L(t)} dI = \\int_{0}^{t} -\\frac{V_{\\text{av}}}{L} d\\tau\n$$\n$$\ni_L(t) - I_0 = -\\frac{V_{\\text{av}}}{L} t\n$$\n$$\ni_L(t) = I_0 - \\frac{V_{\\text{av}}}{L} t\n$$\nThis result shows that the inductor current decays linearly to zero. The avalanche event ends when $i_L(t_{\\text{av}}) = 0$, which allows us to find the duration $t_{\\text{av}}$:\n$$\n0 = I_0 - \\frac{V_{\\text{av}}}{L} t_{\\text{av}} \\implies t_{\\text{av}} = \\frac{L I_0}{V_{\\text{av}}}\n$$\nNow, we can formally calculate the dissipated energy, $E_{\\text{diss}}$, by substituting the expression for $i_L(t)$ into the energy integral:\n$$\nE_{\\text{diss}} = \\int_{0}^{t_{\\text{av}}} V_{\\text{av}} \\left(I_0 - \\frac{V_{\\text{av}}}{L} t\\right) dt\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\text{diss}} = V_{\\text{av}} \\left[ I_0 t - \\frac{V_{\\text{av}}}{2L} t^2 \\right]_{0}^{t_{\\text{av}}} = V_{\\text{av}} \\left( I_0 t_{\\text{av}} - \\frac{V_{\\text{av}}}{2L} t_{\\text{av}}^2 \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting $t_{\\text{av}} = \\frac{L I_0}{V_{\\text{av}}}$:\n$$\nE_{\\text{diss}} = V_{\\text{av}} \\left( I_0 \\left(\\frac{L I_0}{V_{\\text{av}}}\\right) - \\frac{V_{\\text{av}}}{2L} \\left(\\frac{L I_0}{V_{\\text{av}}}\\right)^2 \\right)\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\text{diss}} = V_{\\text{av}} \\left( \\frac{L I_0^2}{V_{\\text{av}}} - \\frac{V_{\\text{av}}}{2L} \\frac{L^2 I_0^2}{V_{\\text{av}}^2} \\right) = V_{\\text{av}} \\left( \\frac{L I_0^2}{V_{\\text{av}}} - \\frac{L I_0^2}{2V_{\\text{av}}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\text{diss}} = V_{\\text{av}} \\left( \\frac{L I_0^2}{2V_{\\text{av}}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} L I_0^2\n$$\nThis derivation confirms that the total energy dissipated in the MOSFET during the avalanche event is precisely equal to the energy initially stored in the inductor.\n\nThe condition for the MOSFET to survive the UIS event is that the energy it dissipates, $E_{\\text{diss}}$, must not exceed its single-pulse avalanche energy rating, $E_{\\text{AS}}$. Therefore, the condition is:\n$$\nE_{\\text{diss}} \\le E_{\\text{AS}}\n$$\nSubstituting our derived expression for $E_{\\text{diss}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} L I_0^2 \\le E_{\\text{AS}}\n$$\nThis is the required condition.

            "problem": "A single-phase boost converter leg consists of a Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) and a fast recovery diode in the high-frequency commutation loop. The loop exhibits a parasitic inductance $L_{p}$ due to device packaging and layout. When the MOSFET turns on, the diode transitions from forward conduction to reverse blocking. During this transition, the diode exhibits reverse recovery, characterized by a reverse recovery charge $Q_{rr}$ that must be removed before the diode fully blocks.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a standard phenomenon in power electronics—voltage overshoot due to diode reverse recovery—and provides sufficient, consistent information to derive a solution based on fundamental principles of circuit theory. The simplifying assumption of a linear current decay is explicitly stated and allows for a tractable analytical solution. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe solution will be developed in three parts as requested: a qualitative explanation, a formal derivation of the voltage spike expression, and a numerical evaluation of the spike's magnitude.\n\n**Qualitative Explanation**\n\nThe voltage overshoot originates from the interaction between the diode's non-ideal turn-off behavior and the parasitic inductance of the commutation loop. The fundamental principles are the inductor constitutive relation, $v(t) = L \\frac{di(t)}{dt}$, and the definition of electric charge as the integral of current, $Q = \\int i(t) dt$.\n\n1.  When the MOSFET in the boost leg turns on, it provides a low-impedance path for the main inductor current that was previously flowing through the diode. The diode is now expected to transition from forward conduction to a reverse-blocking state.\n\n2.  A real diode does not block reverse voltage instantaneously. It contains stored minority charge carriers from its forward conduction phase. Before the diode can support reverse voltage, this stored charge, known as the reverse recovery charge $Q_{rr}$, must be removed.\n\n3.  The removal of $Q_{rr}$ is accomplished by a transient reverse current, let us denote it $i_{rr}(t)$, flowing through the diode. This current flows in the high-frequency commutation loop, which includes the MOSFET and the parasitic inductance $L_p$. The reverse current typically ramps up to a peak value, $I_{RRM}$, and then rapidly decays to zero.\n\n4.  The voltage induced across the parasitic inductance $L_p$ is directly proportional to the rate of change of the current flowing through it, $v_{Lp}(t) = L_p \\frac{di(t)}{dt}$. During the decay phase of the reverse recovery current, the current changes rapidly from its peak value $I_{RRM}$ to zero. This results in a large and negative value for $\\frac{di_{rr}(t)}{dt}$.\n\n5.  According to the inductor equation, this large, negative $\\frac{di}{dt}$ induces a significant voltage spike, $v_{Lp}$, across the parasitic inductance. This voltage adds to the DC bus voltage and appears across the switching device (the MOSFET), potentially exceeding its voltage rating. Thus, the process of clearing the reverse recovery charge $Q_{rr}$ manifests as a current transient whose rapid cessation induces a voltage spike across $L_p$.\n\n**Analytic Derivation**\n\nWe are tasked with deriving an expression for the magnitude of this voltage spike, $V_{spike}$, under the assumption that the reverse recovery current, $i_{rr}(t)$, decays linearly from its peak value, $I_{RRM}$, to zero over a time interval $\\Delta t$.\n\nLet us set $t=0$ at the beginning of the current decay. The current during this interval, for $t \\in [0, \\Delta t]$, can be expressed as a linear function of time:\n$$i_{rr}(t) = I_{RRM} \\left( 1 - \\frac{t}{\\Delta t} \\right)$$\nThe reverse recovery charge $Q_{rr}$ is the total charge that flows during this decay interval. By definition, it is the time integral of the current:\n$$Q_{rr} = \\int_{0}^{\\Delta t} i_{rr}(t) \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{\\Delta t} I_{RRM} \\left( 1 - \\frac{t}{\\Delta t} \\right) \\, dt$$\nEvaluating the integral:\n$$Q_{rr} = I_{RRM} \\left[ t - \\frac{t^2}{2\\Delta t} \\right]_{0}^{\\Delta t} = I_{RRM} \\left( \\Delta t - \\frac{(\\Delta t)^2}{2\\Delta t} \\right) = I_{RRM} \\left( \\Delta t - \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} \\right)$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$Q_{rr} = \\frac{1}{2} I_{RRM} \\Delta t$$\nThis result is expected, as the charge is the area under the current-time graph, which is a triangle with height $I_{RRM}$ and base $\\Delta t$.\n\nThe voltage spike across the parasitic inductance $L_p$ is given by $v_{Lp}(t) = L_p \\frac{di_{rr}(t)}{dt}$. We first calculate the rate of change of current, $\\frac{di_{rr}(t)}{dt}$:\n$$\\frac{di_{rr}(t)}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left[ I_{RRM} \\left( 1 - \\frac{t}{\\Delta t} \\right) \\right] = I_{RRM} \\left( -\\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\right) = -\\frac{I_{RRM}}{\\Delta t}$$\nSince the current decay is linear, its derivative is constant throughout the interval $\\Delta t$. The induced voltage is therefore also constant during this time. The problem asks for the magnitude of this spike, which we denote as $V_{spike}$:\n$$V_{spike} = |v_{Lp}(t)| = \\left| -L_p \\frac{I_{RRM}}{\\Delta t} \\right| = L_p \\frac{I_{RRM}}{\\Delta t}$$\nThis expression depends on $I_{RRM}$, which is not a primary given. We can eliminate $I_{RRM}$ by using the relationship we derived for $Q_{rr}$. From $Q_{rr} = \\frac{1}{2} I_{RRM} \\Delta t$, we solve for the peak current:\n$$I_{RRM} = \\frac{2 Q_{rr}}{\\Delta t}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $I_{RRM}$ into the equation for $V_{spike}$:\n$$V_{spike} = L_p \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\left( \\frac{2 Q_{rr}}{\\Delta t} \\right)$$\nThis yields the final analytic expression for the voltage spike magnitude, based only on the given parameters:\n$$V_{spike} = \\frac{2 L_p Q_{rr}}{(\\Delta t)^2}$$\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n$Q_{rr} = 50 \\, \\mathrm{nC} = 50 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\mathrm{C}$\n$\\Delta t = 50 \\, \\mathrm{ns} = 50 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\mathrm{s}$\n$L_{p} = 15 \\, \\mathrm{nH} = 15 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\mathrm{H}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $V_{spike}$:\n$$V_{spike} = \\frac{2 \\times (15 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\mathrm{H}) \\times (50 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\mathrm{C})}{(50 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\mathrm{s})^2}$$\n$$V_{spike} = \\frac{2 \\times 15 \\times 50 \\times 10^{-18}}{50^2 \\times 10^{-18}} \\, \\mathrm{V}$$\nThe factor of $10^{-18}$ cancels from the numerator and denominator:\n$$V_{spike} = \\frac{2 \\times 15 \\times 50}{2500} \\, \\mathrm{V} = \\frac{1500}{2500} \\, \\mathrm{V} = \\frac{15}{25} \\, \\mathrm{V} = \\frac{3}{5} \\, \\mathrm{V}$$\n$$V_{spike} = 0.6 \\, \\mathrm{V}$$\nThe problem requires the numerical answer to be rounded to three significant figures.
