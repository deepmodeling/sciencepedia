            "problem": "A high-side isolated voltage sensing stage is required to measure up to $1200\\,\\mathrm{V}$ direct current on a bus and convey the measurement across a galvanic isolation barrier using a precision isolation amplifier whose input full-scale is $\\pm 2.5\\,\\mathrm{V}$. The measurement bandwidth is $B=10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, the operating temperature is $T=300\\,\\mathrm{K}$, and the isolation amplifier’s input-referred wideband white noise spectral density is approximately flat at $e_{n}=10\\,\\mathrm{nV}/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$ with an input current noise spectral density $i_{n}=1\\,\\mathrm{pA}/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$. The amplifier input impedance is sufficiently large that it can be neglected relative to the sensing network. The high-voltage bus must not be loaded above $1.0\\,\\mathrm{mA}$ under nominal conditions. The sensing is performed by a simple two-resistor divider referenced to the local high-side ground, whose attenuated output drives the isolation amplifier input.\n\nUsing only the following foundational bases: (i) linear circuit theory for resistive dividers, (ii) Johnson–Nyquist thermal noise of a resistor with two-sided voltage noise spectral density $4 k_{B} T R$ where $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and (iii) superposition of uncorrelated white-noise sources in bandwidth $B$, derive from first principles how the total input-referred root-mean-square noise at the amplifier input depends on the divider’s Thevenin resistance.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically validated and is deemed to be self-contained, scientifically grounded in established principles of circuit theory and noise analysis, and well-posed. All provided parameters are physically realistic and consistent. The problem is a standard, albeit non-trivial, exercise in analog circuit design and optimization. Therefore, a complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for two main results: first, a derivation of the total input-referred root-mean-square (RMS) noise dependence on the divider's Thevenin resistance, and second, the optimal values for the divider resistors, $R_{\\mathrm{top}}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{bottom}}$, that minimize this noise while satisfying the given constraints.\n\nLet the high-side voltage bus be $V_{\\mathrm{bus}}$. The sensing stage is a resistive divider composed of $R_{\\mathrm{top}}$ connected from $V_{\\mathrm{bus}}$ to the sensing node $V_{\\mathrm{out}}$, and $R_{\\mathrm{bottom}}$ connected from $V_{\\mathrm{out}}$ to the high-side ground. The voltage at the sensing node, which is the input to the isolation amplifier, is given by the voltage divider rule:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{out}} = V_{\\mathrm{bus}} \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{bottom}}}{R_{\\mathrm{top}} + R_{\\mathrm{bottom}}}$$\nThe problem specifies a mapping from a maximum bus voltage of $V_{\\mathrm{bus,max}} = 1200\\,\\mathrm{V}$ to a full-scale amplifier input of $V_{\\mathrm{in,max}} = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{V}$. Let the division ratio be $k$.\n$$k = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{in,max}}}{V_{\\mathrm{bus,max}}} = \\frac{2.5\\,\\mathrm{V}}{1200\\,\\mathrm{V}} = \\frac{1}{480}$$\nThis ratio is determined by the resistors:\n$$k = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{bottom}}}{R_{\\mathrm{top}} + R_{\\mathrm{bottom}}} = \\frac{1}{480}$$\nFrom this relationship, we can express $R_{\\mathrm{top}}$ in terms of $R_{\\mathrm{bottom}}$:\n$$480 R_{\\mathrm{bottom}} = R_{\\mathrm{top}} + R_{\\mathrm{bottom}} \\implies R_{\\mathrm{top}} = 479 R_{\\mathrm{bottom}}$$\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the total input-referred noise. The noise sources are the thermal noise of the resistive divider and the intrinsic noise of the isolation amplifier. The divider, as seen from the amplifier's input terminals, can be represented by its Thevenin equivalent: a voltage source $V_{\\mathrm{Th}} = V_{\\mathrm{out}}$ and a series resistance $R_{\\mathrm{Th}}$.\n$$R_{\\mathrm{Th}} = R_{\\mathrm{top}} \\| R_{\\mathrm{bottom}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{top}} R_{\\mathrm{bottom}}}{R_{\\mathrm{top}} + R_{\\mathrm{bottom}}}$$\nThe uncorrelated noise sources contributing to the total noise at the amplifier's input are:\n1.  **Divider Thermal Noise**: The Thevenin resistance $R_{\\mathrm{Th}}$ generates Johnson-Nyquist noise. The problem specifies a two-sided voltage noise spectral density of $4 k_{B} T R$. This is more commonly expressed as the one-sided voltage noise spectral density $S_{v,R}(f) = 4 k_{B} T R_{\\mathrm{Th}}$ in units of $\\mathrm{V}^{2}/\\mathrm{Hz}$. The mean-square noise voltage from this source in a bandwidth $B$ is $v_{n,R}^2 = (4 k_{B} T R_{\\mathrm{Th}}) B$.\n2.  **Amplifier Voltage Noise**: The amplifier has an input-referred voltage noise with spectral density $e_n$. Its mean-square contribution is $v_{n,e}^2 = e_n^2 B$.\n3.  **Amplifier Current Noise**: The amplifier has an input-referred current noise with spectral density $i_n$. This current flows through the source impedance, $R_{\\mathrmTh}$, creating a voltage noise. Its mean-square contribution is $v_{n,i}^2 = (i_n R_{\\mathrm{Th}})^2 B = i_n^2 R_{\\mathrm{Th}}^2 B$.\n\nSince these sources are uncorrelated, we can sum their mean-square values (superposition of powers) to find the total mean-square noise voltage, $v_{n,\\mathrm{total}}^2$:\n$$v_{n,\\mathrm{total}}^2 = v_{n,R}^2 + v_{n,e}^2 + v_{n,i}^2 = (4 k_{B} T R_{\\mathrm{Th}} + e_n^2 + i_n^2 R_{\\mathrm{Th}}^2) B$$\nThe total input-referred root-mean-square (RMS) noise voltage, $v_{n,\\mathrm{rms}}$, is the square root of this quantity. This expression shows how the total RMS noise depends on the divider's Thevenin resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{Th}}$, as requested:\n$$v_{n,\\mathrm{rms}} = \\sqrt{B \\left( i_n^2 R_{\\mathrm{Th}}^2 + 4 k_{B} T R_{\\mathrm{Th}} + e_n^2 \\right)}$$\nTo minimize the noise, we must minimize the term inside the parenthesis, which we define as a function of $R_{\\mathrm{Th}}$:\n$$f(R_{\\mathrm{Th}}) = i_n^2 R_{\\mathrm{Th}}^2 + 4 k_{B} T R_{\\mathrm{Th}} + e_n^2$$\nWe analyze this function's dependence on $R_{\\mathrm{Th}}$ by taking its derivative:\n$$\\frac{df}{dR_{\\mathrm{Th}}} = 2 i_n^2 R_{\\mathrm{Th}} + 4 k_{B} T$$\nSince $i_n^2 > 0$, $k_B > 0$, $T > 0$, and for any physical circuit $R_{\\mathrmTh} \\ge 0$, the derivative $\\frac{df}{dR_{\\mathrm{Th}}}$ is strictly positive. This indicates that $f(R_{\\mathrm{Th}})$ is a monotonically increasing function of $R_{\\mathrm{Th}}$ for all physically realizable values of $R_{\\mathrm{Th}}$. Therefore, to minimize the total input-referred noise, one must choose the smallest possible value for the Thevenin resistance $R_{\\mathrm{Th}}$.\n\nNow we relate $R_{\\mathrm{Th}}$ to the external constraints. Let $R_{\\mathrm{total}} = R_{\\mathrm{top}} + R_{\\mathrm{bottom}}$. We can write $R_{\\mathrm{Th}}$ in terms of $R_{\\mathrm{total}}$ and the division ratio $k$:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{Th}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{top}} R_{\\mathrm{bottom}}}{R_{\\mathrm{top}} + R_{\\mathrm{bottom}}} = \\frac{((1-k)R_{\\mathrm{total}})(kR_{\\mathrm{total}})}{R_{\\mathrm{total}}} = k(1-k)R_{\\mathrm{total}}$$\nWith $k = 1/480$, this becomes:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{Th}} = \\frac{1}{480}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{480}\\right)R_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\frac{479}{480^2}R_{\\mathrm{total}}$$\nSince $R_{\\mathrm{Th}}$ is directly proportional to $R_{\\mathrm{total}}$, minimizing $R_{\\mathrm{Th}}$ is equivalent to minimizing $R_{\\mathrm{total}}$.\n\nThe minimum value of $R_{\\mathrm{total}}$ is set by the current loading constraint. The divider current $I_{\\mathrm{div}}$ at maximum bus voltage must not exceed $1.0\\,\\mathrm{mA}$:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{div}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{bus,max}}}{R_{\\mathrm{total}}} \\le 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A}$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{total}} \\ge \\frac{1200\\,\\mathrm{V}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A}} \\implies R_{\\mathrm{total}} \\ge 1.2 \\times 10^6\\,\\Omega$$\nThe minimum allowed total resistance is $1.2 \\times 10^6\\,\\Omega$. This value minimizes $R_{\\mathrm{total}}$ and hence minimizes the noise. The problem directs us to use this boundary condition for the final calculation:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{total,opt}} = R_{\\mathrm{top}} + R_{\\mathrm{bottom}} = 1.2 \\times 10^6\\,\\Omega$$\nWe now have a system of two linear equations for $R_{\\mathrm{top}}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{bottom}}$:\n1. $R_{\\mathrm{top}} + R_{\\mathrm{bottom}} = 1.2 \\times 10^6$\n2. $R_{\\mathrm{top}} = 479 R_{\\mathrm{bottom}}$\n\nSubstitute (2) into (1):\n$$479 R_{\\mathrm{bottom}} + R_{\\mathrm{bottom}} = 1.2 \\times 10^6$$\n$$480 R_{\\mathrm{bottom}} = 1.2 \\times 10^6$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{bottom}} = \\frac{1.2 \\times 10^6}{480}\\,\\Omega = \\frac{12 \\times 10^5}{480}\\,\\Omega = \\frac{10^5}{40}\\,\\Omega = 2500\\,\\Omega$$\nNow, we find $R_{\\mathrm{top}}$ using $R_{\\mathrm{top}} = 479 R_{\\mathrm{bottom}}$:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{top}} = 479 \\times 2500\\,\\Omega = 1197500\\,\\Omega$$\n\nThe optimal resistor values that minimize the input-referred noise while satisfying the full-scale and current-loading constraints are $R_{\\mathrm{top}} = 1197500\\,\\Omega$ and $R_{\\mathrm{bottom}} = 2500\\,\\Omega$.",

It represents a standard, formalizable problem in applied physics and electrical engineering. The solution process may now proceed.\n\nThe derivation begins with the Maxwell–Ampère law in its integral form:\n$$\n\\oint_{\\partial S} \\mathbf{H} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = \\iint_S \\mathbf{J} \\cdot d\\mathbf{S} + \\iint_S \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{D}}{\\partial t} \\cdot d\\mathbf{S}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{H}$ is the magnetic field intensity, $\\mathbf{J}$ is the free current density (conduction current), and $\\mathbf{D}$ is the electric displacement field. The second term on the right-hand side represents the displacement current. The problem states that there is no ohmic conduction through the barrier, which implies that the free current density $\\mathbf{J}$ is zero within the dielectric. The total current passing through a surface $A$ within the dielectric is therefore purely a displacement current, $i_{D}(t)$, given by:\n$$\ni_{D}(t) = \\iint_A \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{D}}{\\partial t} \\cdot d\\mathbf{S}\n$$\nTo proceed, we must make two standard approximations for this geometry, which is effectively a parallel-plate capacitor.\n1.  **Lumped-Element Approximation:** We model the distributed capacitance of the barrier as a single, lumped device. This is valid as long as the physical dimensions ($d$, $\\sqrt{A}$) are much smaller than the wavelength corresponding to the highest frequencies of interest in $v(t)$.\n2.  **Uniform Field Approximation:** We assume that the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ and, consequently, the electric displacement field $\\mathbf{D}$ are uniform throughout the volume of the dielectric between the conductive regions and are directed perpendicularly to the plane of the overlap area $A$. This neglects fringing fields at the edges of the plates.\n\nUnder these approximations, the vector field $\\mathbf{D}$ is parallel to the surface normal vector $d\\mathbf{S}$ and its magnitude $D$ is constant over the area $A$. The integral simplifies to:\n$$\ni_{D}(t) = A \\frac{dD(t)}{dt}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the use of the linear dielectric constitutive relation, which connects the electric displacement field $\\mathbf{D}$ to the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{D} = \\varepsilon_{b} \\mathbf{E}\n$$\nIn scalar form, for our uniform field, this is $D(t) = \\varepsilon_{b} E(t)$. Substituting this into the expression for current yields:\n$$\ni_{D}(t) = A \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\varepsilon_{b} E(t) \\right)\n$$\nSince the permittivity $\\varepsilon_{b}$ is a constant for a linear dielectric, it can be moved outside the time derivative:\n$$\ni_{D}(t) = A \\varepsilon_{b} \\frac{dE(t)}{dt}\n$$\nThe uniform electric field $E(t)$ between two parallel plates separated by a distance $d$ is related to the potential difference (voltage) $v(t)$ across them by $E(t) = \\frac{v(t)}{d}$. Substituting this relationship into the current equation gives:\n$$\ni_{D}(t) = A \\varepsilon_{b} \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{v(t)}{d} \\right)\n$$\nAs the physical parameters $A$ and $d$ are constants, we arrive at:\n$$\ni_{D}(t) = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{b} A}{d} \\frac{dv(t)}{dt}\n$$\nThis expression gives the displacement current through the barrier. In compliance with the problem's instructions, we now introduce and define an effective barrier capacitance, $C_{b}$. The term $\\frac{\\varepsilon_{b} A}{d}$ is the well-known formula for the capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor. We thus define:\n$$\nC_b \\equiv \\frac{\\varepsilon_{b} A}{d}\n$$\nSubstituting this definition into our current expression, we obtain the displacement current solely in terms of $C_{b}$ and the rate of change of voltage, as required:\n$$\ni_{D}(t) = C_b \\frac{dv(t)}{dt}\n$$\nBy the principle of charge conservation, this displacement current flowing through the dielectric from the high side to the low side must be equal to the conduction current flowing into the low-side conductive region to supply the necessary charge. Therefore, this is the expression for the current that appears on the low side.\n\nFinally, we evaluate the magnitude of this transient current, $I_D$, for the given parameters.\nThe barrier capacitance is $C_b = 10\\,\\mathrm{pF} = 10 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F}$.\nThe rate of change of voltage is $\\frac{dv}{dt} = 100\\,\\mathrm{V/ns}$.

Thus, $v_e(0) = 0$.\n$$v_e(0) = A \\exp(0) + R_{\\mathrm{in}}I_b = A + R_{\\mathrm{in}}I_b = 0$$\nThis implies that $A = -R_{\\mathrm{in}}I_b$.\n\nSubstituting the value of $A$ back into the general solution gives the time-domain expression for the error voltage during the ramp:\n$$v_e(t) = R_{\\mathrm{in}}I_b - R_{\\mathrm{in}}I_b \\exp(-t/\\tau) = R_{\\mathrm{in}}I_b \\left(1 - \\exp(-t/\\tau)\\right)$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $I_b$ and $\\tau$, the full expression for $v_e(t)$ for $0 \\le t \\le T_r$ is:\n$$v_e(t) = R_{\\mathrm{in}} \\left(C_b \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{CM}}}{T_r}\\right) \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{R_{\\mathrm{in}}C_{\\mathrm{in}}}\\right)\\right)$$\nThe problem asks for the value of this voltage at the end of the ramp, $t = T_r$:\n$$v_e(T_r) = R_{\\mathrm{in}} C_b \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{CM}}}{T_r} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T_r}{R_{\\mathrm{in}}C_{\\mathrm{in}}}\\right)\\right)$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical parameters:\n- $C_b = 2\\,\\mathrm{pF} = 2 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F}$\n- $R_{\\mathrm{in}} = 50\\,\\mathrm{k\\Omega} = 5 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega}$\n- $C_{\\mathrm{in}} = 200\\,\\mathrm{pF} = 2 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{F}$\n- $V_{\\mathrm{CM}} = 100\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n- $T_r = 100\\,\\mathrm{ns} = 1 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the time constant $\\tau$:\n$$\\tau = R_{\\mathrm{in}}C_{\\mathrm{in}} = (5 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega}) \\times (2 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{F}) = 10 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 1 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nNext, we calculate the pre-factor term $R_{\\mathrm{in}} C_b \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{CM}}}{T_r}$:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{in}} C_b \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{CM}}}{T_r} = (5 \\times 10^4) \\times (2 \\times 10^{-12}) \\frac{100}{1 \\times 10^{-7}} = (10 \\times 10^{-8}) \\times (1 \\times 10^9) = 100\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nThen, we calculate the argument of the exponential function:\n$$-\\frac{T_r}{R_{\\mathrm{in}}C_{\\mathrm{in}}} = -\\frac{1 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{s}}{1 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{s}} = -10^{-2} = -0.01$$\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $v_e(T_r)$:\n$$v_e(T_r) = 100\\,\\mathrm{V} \\times \\left(1 - \\exp(-0.01)\\right)$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\\exp(-0.01) \\approx 0.99004983$$\n$$v_e(T_r) \\approx 100 \\times (1 - 0.99004983) = 100 \\times 0.00995017 = 0.995017\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as required gives:\n$$v_e(T_r) \\approx 0.9950\\,\\mathrm{V}$$",
