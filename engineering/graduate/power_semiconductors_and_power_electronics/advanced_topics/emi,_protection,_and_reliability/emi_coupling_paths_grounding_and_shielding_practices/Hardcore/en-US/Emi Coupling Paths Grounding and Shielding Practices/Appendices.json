It is therefore deemed **valid**. The solution will now proceed.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem consists of two parts: first, to calculate the instantaneous common-mode current injected into the chassis, and second, to identify and explain the dominant mechanism for EMI coupling to nearby cables.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the Instantaneous Displacement Current**\n\nThe relationship between current, $i(t)$, through a capacitor and the voltage, $v(t)$, across it is defined by the fundamental capacitor equation:\n$$\ni(t) = C \\frac{dv(t)}{dt}\n$$\nIn this problem, we are considering the displacement current, which is a common-mode current, $I_{cm}$, flowing through the parasitic capacitance, $C_{sh}$, due to the rapid change in voltage (slew rate), $\\frac{dv}{dt}$, of the switching node with respect to the chassis. The chassis is assumed to be at a reference potential, so the voltage across $C_{sh}$ changes at the same rate as the switching node voltage.\n\nThe given values are:\n- Parasitic capacitance, $C_{sh} = 50\\ \\mathrm{pF} = 50 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{F}$.\n- Voltage slew rate, $\\frac{dv}{dt} = 50\\ \\mathrm{kV/\\mu s}$.\n\nBefore calculating, the slew rate must be converted to standard SI units (V/s):\n$$\n\\frac{dv}{dt} = 50\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{kV}}{\\mathrm{\\mu s}} = 50 \\times \\frac{10^3\\ \\mathrm{V}}{10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{s}} = 50 \\times 10^9\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{V}}{\\mathrm{s}}\n$$\nSince the problem states that the slew rate is constant during the voltage transition, the instantaneous current will also be constant during this period. We can now calculate the magnitude of this common-mode current, $I_{cm}$:\n$$\nI_{cm} = C_{sh} \\frac{dv}{dt}\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\nI_{cm} = (50 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{F}) \\times (50 \\times 10^9\\ \\mathrm{V/s})\n$$\n$$\nI_{cm} = (50 \\times 50) \\times 10^{(-12 + 9)}\\ \\mathrm{A} = 2500 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{A}\n$$\n$$\nI_{cm} = 2.5\\ \\mathrm{A}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, the current is $2.50\\ \\mathrm{A}$.\n\n**Part 2: Explanation of the Dominant Coupling Mechanism**\n\nThe EMI problem described involves a source, a coupling path, and a victim. We must identify these components to determine the dominant coupling mechanism.\n\n1.  **Noise Source:** The primary noise source is the high, time-varying voltage ($\\frac{dv}{dt}$) at the half-bridge inverter's switching node. According to Maxwell's equations, a time-varying electric field gives rise to a displacement current. In circuit terms, any rapid change in voltage across a parasitic capacitance results in a current, as calculated in Part 1.\n\n2.  **Primary Coupling and Common-Mode Excitation:** The current $I_{cm} = 2.50\\ \\mathrm{A}$ is injected into the metallic chassis via the parasitic capacitance $C_{sh}$. Since the chassis is bonded to protective earth through a strap which has non-zero impedance (primarily inductance, $L_{strap}$), this current creates a common-mode voltage, $V_{cm}$, on the chassis with respect to the earth reference. This voltage is given by $V_{cm}(t) = Z_{strap} \\cdot I_{cm}(t)$, where $Z_{strap}$ is the impedance of the ground strap. The entire chassis is therefore raised to a non-zero, time-varying potential relative to the system's ground reference.\n\n3.  **Secondary Coupling to Victim Cables:** The chassis, now acting as a large conductive surface with a common-mode voltage $V_{cm}$, becomes a secondary aggressor or antenna. The problem states that nearby unshielded signal cables run parallel to this chassis. This geometry creates a new parasitic capacitance, $C_{coupling}$, between the chassis (aggressor) and the signal cables (victim).\n\nThe dominant coupling mechanism for noise injection into these cables is **capacitive coupling** (also known as electric field coupling). The reasoning is as follows:\n- The fundamental noise source is a high $\\frac{dv}{dt}$, which is inherently an electric field phenomenon.\n- This high $\\frac{dv}{dt}$ source creates a large potential difference ($V_{cm}$) on the chassis. A potential difference between two conductors (chassis and signal cables) separated by a dielectric (air) establishes an electric field.\n- The time-varying nature of $V_{cm}$ creates a time-varying electric field between the chassis and the cables.\n- This time-varying electric field induces a noise current, $I_{noise}$, onto the signal cables via the coupling capacitance $C_{coupling}$, according to the relation $I_{noise} = C_{coupling}\\frac{dV_{cm}}{dt}$.\n- The parallel arrangement of the cables and chassis maximizes the surface area for this capacitive coupling, making it an efficient path for noise transfer. The fact that the cables are unshielded means there is no Faraday shield to terminate the electric field lines and divert the displacement current to ground before it reaches the signal conductors.\n\nWhile inductive (magnetic field) coupling also exists, it is generated by time-varying currents ($di/dt$) flowing in loops. Although the $2.50\\ \\mathrm{A}$ common-mode current has a high-frequency spectrum and thus a non-zero $di/dt$, the problem's premise is explicitly built around a very large $\\frac{dv}{dt}$ ($50 \\times 10^9\\ \\mathrm{V/s}$). In such high-slew-rate, high-voltage systems (often called high impedance sources), electric field effects and capacitive coupling are typically the most pronounced near-field EMI mechanisms. The problem setup—a voltage source driving a parasitic capacitance to create a common-mode voltage on a large surface near a victim cable—is a classic example of dominant capacitive coupling.",

A full solution will be provided.\n\n---\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution is derived in four parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n#### 1. Initial Voltage Overshoot ($V_0$)\n\nAccording to Faraday's law of induction applied to a lumped inductor, the voltage $V$ induced across an inductance $L$ due to a time-varying current $i(t)$ is given by:\n$$V = L \\frac{di}{dt}$$\nThis induced voltage is the overshoot across the switching device during turn-off. We are given the initial loop inductance $L_{\\text{loop,0}} = 20\\ \\mathrm{nH}$ and the current slew rate $\\frac{di}{dt} = 200\\ \\mathrm{A/\\mu s}$.\n\nFirst, we convert the given values to base SI units:\n$$L_{\\text{loop,0}} = 20\\ \\mathrm{nH} = 20 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{H}$$\n$$\\frac{di}{dt} = 200\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{A}}{\\mu \\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{200\\ \\mathrm{A}}{10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{s}} = 200 \\times 10^6\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{A}}{\\mathrm{s}}$$\n\nThe initial voltage overshoot, $V_0$, is then calculated as:\n$$V_0 = L_{\\text{loop,0}} \\frac{di}{dt} = (20 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{H}) \\times (200 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{A/s})$$\n$$V_0 = 4000 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{V} = 4\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\n\n#### 2. New Voltage Overshoot ($V_1$)\n\nThe problem states that the loop area $A$ is doubled, and the loop inductance $L_{\\text{loop}}$ scales linearly with $A$. Let the initial area and inductance be $A_0$ and $L_0$, respectively, and the new area and inductance be $A_1$ and $L_1$.\nWe are given:\n$$A_1 = 2 A_0$$\nThe linear scaling implies $L_{\\text{loop}} \\propto A$, so we can write the ratio:\n$$\\frac{L_1}{L_0} = \\frac{A_1}{A_0} = \\frac{2 A_0}{A_0} = 2$$\nThe new inductance is therefore $L_1 = 2 L_0$.\n$$L_1 = 2 \\times (20 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{H}) = 40 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{H}$$\n\nThe current slew rate $\\frac{di}{dt}$ remains unchanged. The new voltage overshoot, $V_1$, is:\n$$V_1 = L_1 \\frac{di}{dt} = (2 L_0) \\frac{di}{dt} = 2 \\left( L_0 \\frac{di}{dt} \\right) = 2 V_0$$\n$$V_1 = 2 \\times (4\\ \\mathrm{V}) = 8\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\nAs derived, doubling the loop area doubles the voltage overshoot under the given scaling assumption.\n\n#### 3. Conducted Emission Amplitude Scaling ($S_{\\text{DM}}$)\n\nThe problem states that the conducted emissions are dominated by the differential-mode (DM) voltage associated with the switching node. This DM voltage is precisely the voltage overshoot generated across the commutation loop inductance.\n$$V_{\\text{DM}} = V_{\\text{overshoot}} = L_{\\text{loop}} \\frac{di}{dt}$$\nThe scaling factor for the conducted emission amplitude, $S_{\\text{DM}}$, is the ratio of the new amplitude ($V_{DM,1}$) to the original amplitude ($V_{DM,0}$).\n$$S_{\\text{DM}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{DM,1}}}{V_{\\text{DM,0}}} = \\frac{V_1}{V_0}$$\nFrom the previous part, we found that $V_1 = 2 V_0$. Therefore:\n$$S_{\\text{DM}} = \\frac{2 V_0}{V_0} = 2$$\nThe scaling factor for the conducted DM emission amplitude is $2$.\n\n#### 4. Radiated Power Scaling ($S_P$)\n\nThe loop is modeled as a magnetic dipole with moment $m = IA$, where $I$ is the amplitude of the relevant harmonic current and $A$ is the loop area. The total power, $P$, radiated by a time-harmonic magnetic dipole in free space is given by first principles as:\n$$P = \\frac{\\mu_0 \\omega^4 |m|^2}{12 \\pi c^3}$$\nwhere $\\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of the current, and $c$ is the speed of light. For the purpose of scaling, we only need the proportionality:\n$$P \\propto |m|^2$$\nSubstituting the expression for the magnetic moment, $m = IA$:\n$$P \\propto (IA)^2 = I^2 A^2$$\nWe are asked to find the scaling factor of the total radiated power, $S_P$, when the loop area is doubled. Let the initial state be $(P_0, I_0, A_0)$ and the new state be $(P_1, I_1, A_1)$. The problem specifies that the current amplitude $I$ remains unchanged, so $I_1 = I_0$. The area is doubled, so $A_1 = 2 A_0$.\n\nThe scaling factor $S_P$ is the ratio $\\frac{P_1}{P_0}$:\n$$S_P = \\frac{P_1}{P_0} = \\frac{k \\cdot I_1^2 A_1^2}{k \\cdot I_0^2 A_0^2}$$\nwhere $k$ is the constant of proportionality.\n$$S_P = \\frac{I_0^2 (2 A_0)^2}{I_0^2 A_0^2} = \\frac{I_0^2 \\cdot 4 A_0^2}{I_0^2 A_0^2} = 4$$\nThe scaling factor for the total radiated power is $4$.\n\nThe final results are:\n- $V_0 = 4\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n- $V_1 = 8\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n- $S_{\\text{DM}} = 2$\n- $S_P = 4$\nThese are to be presented in a row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} V_0 & V_1 & S_{\\text{DM}} & S_P \\end{pmatrix}$.",

The slit has length $L$ and width $w$, and is centered above the dielectric layer of thickness $h$ with relative permittivity $\\varepsilon_{r}$. The environment above the upper plate is air.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on established principles of electromagnetism, transmission line theory, and antenna theory, as applied to the practical engineering problem of electromagnetic interference (EMI) in power electronics. The data provided are consistent and sufficient for a unique solution.\n\nThe solution is presented in three parts, corresponding to the three tasks outlined in the problem.\n\n### Part 1: Electromagnetic Implications of the Slit\n\nAn ideal closed conducting surface provides perfect shielding. According to Maxwell's equations, a time-varying electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ generates a magnetic field $\\mathbf{H}$ (Faraday's Law of Induction, $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}$), and a time-varying magnetic field or a current density $\\mathbf{J}$ generates an electric field (Ampere-Maxwell Law, $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{J} + \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{D}}{\\partial t}$). For a perfect electric conductor (PEC), the boundary conditions dictate that the tangential component of the electric field $\\mathbf{E}_{\\text{tan}}$ on its surface must be zero.\n$$\n\\mathbf{\\hat{n}} \\times \\mathbf{E} = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}$ is the unit normal vector to the surface.\n\nIn the case of the continuous, unslitted bus bar, the common-mode voltage between the plates and the chassis creates an internal, time-varying electric field. This gives rise to a displacement current density $\\mathbf{J}_D = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{D}}{\\partial t} = \\varepsilon \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t}$ inside the dielectric. This current terminates on the inner surface of the upper copper plate, inducing a surface charge density. The zero-tangential-$\\mathbf{E}$ boundary condition ensures that the internal fields are completely contained. No electromagnetic field can exist on the exterior surface, and thus no energy is radiated.\n\nWhen a slit is introduced in the upper conducting plate, it creates an aperture. This aperture is a region where the PEC boundary condition is violated. The internal electric field, driven by the common-mode voltage, now exists across the narrow width of the slit. This field, $\\mathbf{E}_{\\text{ap}}$, is oriented primarily transversely to the length of the slit and is tangential to the plane of the upper plate.\n\nAccording to the field equivalence principle (a consequence of the uniqueness theorem in electromagnetics), the fields in the region external to the bus bar can be found by assuming the aperture is closed off by a PEC and placing equivalent surface currents on it. The tangential electric field in the aperture, $\\mathbf{E}_{\\text{ap}}$, is equivalent to a magnetic surface current density $\\mathbf{M}_s$ given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{M}_s = -\\mathbf{\\hat{n}} \\times \\mathbf{E}_{\\text{ap}}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}$ now points out of the bus bar structure. This time-varying magnetic current acts as a source that radiates electromagnetic waves into the external environment (air). The displacement current associated with the internal common-mode fields is effectively \"leaked\" through the aperture, driving the radiation. This radiated energy is precisely the unwanted electromagnetic interference (EMI). The slit behaves as a slot antenna, and its radiation efficiency is maximized at its resonant frequencies.\n\n### Part 2: Slotline Resonator Model and Resonance Frequency\n\nThe slit in the conducting plane can be modeled as a section of a slotline transmission line. A slotline consists of a narrow gap in a conductive plane, with the electromagnetic wave propagating along this gap. The fields are concentrated in and near the slot.\n\nThe ends of the slit are where the narrow gap terminates into the continuous conducting plane. At these points, the conducting material effectively shorts out the transverse electric field across the slot. Therefore, the ends of the slit act as short-circuits for the slotline mode. A transmission line resonator of length $L$ with short-circuits at both ends supports standing waves. Resonance occurs when the length $L$ is an integer multiple of half the guided wavelength, $\\lambda_{g}$.\n$$\nL = n \\frac{\\lambda_{g}}{2}, \\quad n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots\n$$\nThe fundamental resonance corresponds to $n=1$, where the length of the slot is exactly one-half of the guided wavelength:\n$$\nL = \\frac{\\lambda_{g}}{2}\n$$\nThe propagation constant $\\beta$ (or phase constant) is related to the guided wavelength by $\\beta = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda_{g}}$. Substituting this into the fundamental resonance condition gives:\n$$\nL = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta} \\right) \\implies \\beta L = \\pi\n$$\nThis is the resonance condition in terms of the propagation constant.\n\nTo find the resonance frequency $f_{1}$, we relate the guided wavelength to the phase velocity $v_p$ of the wave and the frequency $f$ by $\\lambda_{g} = v_p / f$. For a quasi-TEM mode in a medium with an effective relative permittivity $\\varepsilon_{\\text{eff}}$, the phase velocity is $v_p = \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{\\varepsilon_{\\text{eff}}}}$, where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum.\n\nSubstituting these relations into the fundamental resonance condition $L = \\lambda_{g}/2$:\n$$\nL = \\frac{1}{2f_{1}} \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{\\varepsilon_{\\text{eff}}}}\n$$\nSolving for the fundamental resonance frequency $f_{1}$ yields:\n$$\nf_{1} = \\frac{c}{2L\\sqrt{\\varepsilon_{\\text{eff}}}}\n$$\nThis expression gives the first resonant frequency of the slit, which is when its radiation as a slot antenna is most efficient.\n\n### Part 3: Numerical Calculation\n\nThe problem provides the necessary values for the calculation.\nGiven:\nSlit length, $L = 0.120\\,\\text{m}$.\nDielectric relative permittivity, $\\varepsilon_{r} = 3.6$.\nFraction of electric field energy in the dielectric, $p = 0.65$.\nSpeed of light in vacuum, $c = 2.99792458 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\text{m/s}$.\n\nFirst, we must compute the effective relative permittivity, $\\varepsilon_{\\text{eff}}$, using the provided energy-partition formula. The slot is a mixed-dielectric structure, with fields existing both in the air half-space (relative permittivity $\\varepsilon_{r, \\text{air}} = 1$) and the dielectric substrate half-space ($\\varepsilon_r = 3.6$).\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\text{eff}} = p\\,\\varepsilon_{r} + (1-p) \\cdot 1\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\text{eff}} = (0.65)(3.6) + (1-0.65)(1.0)\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\text{eff}} = 2.34 + (0.35)(1.0) = 2.34 + 0.35 = 2.69\n$$\nNow, we can calculate the fundamental resonant frequency $f_{1}$ using the derived formula:\n$$\nf_{1} = \\frac{c}{2L\\sqrt{\\varepsilon_{\\text{eff}}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\nf_{1} = \\frac{2.99792458 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\text{m/s}}{2(0.120\\,\\text{m})\\sqrt{2.69}}\n$$\n$$\nf_{1} = \\frac{2.99792458 \\times 10^{8}}{0.240 \\times \\sqrt{2.69}} \\approx \\frac{2.99792458 \\times 10^{8}}{0.240 \\times 1.6401219}\n$$\n$$\nf_{1} \\approx \\frac{2.99792458 \\times 10^{8}}{0.393629267} \\approx 761.60905 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{Hz}\n$$\nThe result is approximately $761.60905\\,\\text{MHz}$. The problem requires the answer in megahertz (MHz), rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nf_{1} \\approx 761.6\\,\\text{MHz}\n$$\nThe provided values for slit width $w$ and dielectric thickness $h$ were not directly used in this final calculation because their influence is implicitly captured within the given energy partition factor $p$. A full electromagnetic field simulation would require $w$ and $h$ to determine $p$.",
