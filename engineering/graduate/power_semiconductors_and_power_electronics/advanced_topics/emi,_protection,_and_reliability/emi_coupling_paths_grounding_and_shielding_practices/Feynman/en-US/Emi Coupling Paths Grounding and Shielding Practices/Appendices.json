It is therefore deemed **valid**. The solution will now proceed.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem consists of two parts: first, to calculate the instantaneous common-mode current injected into the chassis, and second, to identify and explain the dominant mechanism for EMI coupling to nearby cables.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the Instantaneous Displacement Current**\n\nThe relationship between current, $i(t)$, through a capacitor and the voltage, $v(t)$, across it is defined by the fundamental capacitor equation:\n$$\ni(t) = C \\frac{dv(t)}{dt}\n$$\nIn this problem, we are considering the displacement current, which is a common-mode current, $I_{cm}$, flowing through the parasitic capacitance, $C_{sh}$, due to the rapid change in voltage (slew rate), $\\frac{dv}{dt}$, of the switching node with respect to the chassis. The chassis is assumed to be at a reference potential, so the voltage across $C_{sh}$ changes at the same rate as the switching node voltage.\n\nThe given values are:\n- Parasitic capacitance, $C_{sh} = 50\\ \\mathrm{pF} = 50 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{F}$.\n- Voltage slew rate, $\\frac{dv}{dt} = 50\\ \\mathrm{kV/\\mu s}$.\n\nBefore calculating, the slew rate must be converted to standard SI units (V/s):\n$$\n\\frac{dv}{dt} = 50\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{kV}}{\\mathrm{\\mu s}} = 50 \\times \\frac{10^3\\ \\mathrm{V}}{10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{s}} = 50 \\times 10^9\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{V}}{\\mathrm{s}}\n$$\nSince the problem states that the slew rate is constant during the voltage transition, the instantaneous current will also be constant during this period. We can now calculate the magnitude of this common-mode current, $I_{cm}$:\n$$\nI_{cm} = C_{sh} \\frac{dv}{dt}\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\nI_{cm} = (50 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{F}) \\times (50 \\times 10^9\\ \\mathrm{V/s})\n$$\n$$\nI_{cm} = (50 \\times 50) \\times 10^{(-12 + 9)}\\ \\mathrm{A} = 2500 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{A}\n$$\n$$\nI_{cm} = 2.5\\ \\mathrm{A}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, the current is $2.50\\ \\mathrm{A}$.\n\n**Part 2: Explanation of the Dominant Coupling Mechanism**\n\nThe EMI problem described involves a source, a coupling path, and a victim. We must identify these components to determine the dominant coupling mechanism.\n\n1.  **Noise Source:** The primary noise source is the high, time-varying voltage ($\\frac{dv}{dt}$) at the half-bridge inverter's switching node. According to Maxwell's equations, a time-varying electric field gives rise to a displacement current. In circuit terms, any rapid change in voltage across a parasitic capacitance results in a current, as calculated in Part 1.\n\n2.  **Primary Coupling and Common-Mode Excitation:** The current $I_{cm} = 2.50\\ \\mathrm{A}$ is injected into the metallic chassis via the parasitic capacitance $C_{sh}$. Since the chassis is bonded to protective earth through a strap which has non-zero impedance (primarily inductance, $L_{strap}$), this current creates a common-mode voltage, $V_{cm}$, on the chassis with respect to the earth reference. This voltage is given by $V_{cm}(t) = Z_{strap} \\cdot I_{cm}(t)$, where $Z_{strap}$ is the impedance of the ground strap. The entire chassis is therefore raised to a non-zero, time-varying potential relative to the system's ground reference.\n\n3.  **Secondary Coupling to Victim Cables:** The chassis, now acting as a large conductive surface with a common-mode voltage $V_{cm}$, becomes a secondary aggressor or antenna. The problem states that nearby unshielded signal cables run parallel to this chassis. This geometry creates a new parasitic capacitance, $C_{coupling}$, between the chassis (aggressor) and the signal cables (victim).\n\nThe dominant coupling mechanism for noise injection into these cables is **capacitive coupling** (also known as electric field coupling). The reasoning is as follows:\n- The fundamental noise source is a high $\\frac{dv}{dt}$, which is inherently an electric field phenomenon.\n- This high $\\frac{dv}{dt}$ source creates a large potential difference ($V_{cm}$) on the chassis. A potential difference between two conductors (chassis and signal cables) separated by a dielectric (air) establishes an electric field.\n- The time-varying nature of $V_{cm}$ creates a time-varying electric field between the chassis and the cables.\n- This time-varying electric field induces a noise current, $I_{noise}$, onto the signal cables via the coupling capacitance $C_{coupling}$, according to the relation $I_{noise} = C_{coupling}\\frac{dV_{cm}}{dt}$.\n- The parallel arrangement of the cables and chassis maximizes the surface area for this capacitive coupling, making it an efficient path for noise transfer. The fact that the cables are unshielded means there is no Faraday shield to terminate the electric field lines and divert the displacement current to ground before it reaches the signal conductors.\n\nWhile inductive (magnetic field) coupling also exists, it is generated by time-varying currents ($di/dt$) flowing in loops. Although the $2.50\\ \\mathrm{A}$ common-mode current has a high-frequency spectrum and thus a non-zero $di/dt$, the problem's premise is explicitly built around a very large $\\frac{dv}{dt}$ ($50 \\times 10^9\\ \\mathrm{V/s}$). In such high-slew-rate, high-voltage systems (often called high impedance sources), electric field effects and capacitive coupling are typically the most pronounced near-field EMI mechanisms. The problem setup—a voltage source driving a parasitic capacitance to create a common-mode voltage on a large surface near a victim cable—is a classic example of dominant capacitive coupling.",

A full solution will be provided.\n\n---\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution is derived in four parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n#### 1. Initial Voltage Overshoot ($V_0$)\n\nAccording to Faraday's law of induction applied to a lumped inductor, the voltage $V$ induced across an inductance $L$ due to a time-varying current $i(t)$ is given by:\n$$V = L \\frac{di}{dt}$$\nThis induced voltage is the overshoot across the switching device during turn-off. We are given the initial loop inductance $L_{\\text{loop,0}} = 20\\ \\mathrm{nH}$ and the current slew rate $\\frac{di}{dt} = 200\\ \\mathrm{A/\\mu s}$.\n\nFirst, we convert the given values to base SI units:\n$$L_{\\text{loop,0}} = 20\\ \\mathrm{nH} = 20 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{H}$$\n$$\\frac{di}{dt} = 200\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{A}}{\\mu \\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{200\\ \\mathrm{A}}{10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{s}} = 200 \\times 10^6\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{A}}{\\mathrm{s}}$$\n\nThe initial voltage overshoot, $V_0$, is then calculated as:\n$$V_0 = L_{\\text{loop,0}} \\frac{di}{dt} = (20 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{H}) \\times (200 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{A/s})$$\n$$V_0 = 4000 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{V} = 4\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\n\n#### 2. New Voltage Overshoot ($V_1$)\n\nThe problem states that the loop area $A$ is doubled, and the loop inductance $L_{\\text{loop}}$ scales linearly with $A$. Let the initial area and inductance be $A_0$ and $L_0$, respectively, and the new area and inductance be $A_1$ and $L_1$.\nWe are given:\n$$A_1 = 2 A_0$$\nThe linear scaling implies $L_{\\text{loop}} \\propto A$, so we can write the ratio:\n$$\\frac{L_1}{L_0} = \\frac{A_1}{A_0} = \\frac{2 A_0}{A_0} = 2$$\nThe new inductance is therefore $L_1 = 2 L_0$.\n$$L_1 = 2 \\times (20 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{H}) = 40 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{H}$$\n\nThe current slew rate $\\frac{di}{dt}$ remains unchanged. The new voltage overshoot, $V_1$, is:\n$$V_1 = L_1 \\frac{di}{dt} = (2 L_0) \\frac{di}{dt} = 2 \\left( L_0 \\frac{di}{dt} \\right) = 2 V_0$$\n$$V_1 = 2 \\times (4\\ \\mathrm{V}) = 8\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\nAs derived, doubling the loop area doubles the voltage overshoot under the given scaling assumption.\n\n#### 3. Conducted Emission Amplitude Scaling ($S_{\\text{DM}}$)\n\nThe problem states that the conducted emissions are dominated by the differential-mode (DM) voltage associated with the switching node. This DM voltage is precisely the voltage overshoot generated across the commutation loop inductance.\n$$V_{\\text{DM}} = V_{\\text{overshoot}} = L_{\\text{loop}} \\frac{di}{dt}$$\nThe scaling factor for the conducted emission amplitude, $S_{\\text{DM}}$, is the ratio of the new amplitude ($V_{DM,1}$) to the original amplitude ($V_{DM,0}$).\n$$S_{\\text{DM}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{DM,1}}}{V_{\\text{DM,0}}} = \\frac{V_1}{V_0}$$\nFrom the previous part, we found that $V_1 = 2 V_0$. Therefore:\n$$S_{\\text{DM}} = \\frac{2 V_0}{V_0} = 2$$\nThe scaling factor for the conducted DM emission amplitude is $2$.\n\n#### 4. Radiated Power Scaling ($S_P$)\n\nThe loop is modeled as a magnetic dipole with moment $m = IA$, where $I$ is the amplitude of the relevant harmonic current and $A$ is the loop area. The total power, $P$, radiated by a time-harmonic magnetic dipole in free space is given by first principles as:\n$$P = \\frac{\\mu_0 \\omega^4 |m|^2}{12 \\pi c^3}$$\nwhere $\\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of the current, and $c$ is the speed of light. For the purpose of scaling, we only need the proportionality:\n$$P \\propto |m|^2$$\nSubstituting the expression for the magnetic moment, $m = IA$:\n$$P \\propto (IA)^2 = I^2 A^2$$\nWe are asked to find the scaling factor of the total radiated power, $S_P$, when the loop area is doubled. Let the initial state be $(P_0, I_0, A_0)$ and the new state be $(P_1, I_1, A_1)$. The problem specifies that the current amplitude $I$ remains unchanged, so $I_1 = I_0$. The area is doubled, so $A_1 = 2 A_0$.\n\nThe scaling factor $S_P$ is the ratio $\\frac{P_1}{P_0}$:\n$$S_P = \\frac{P_1}{P_0} = \\frac{k \\cdot I_1^2 A_1^2}{k \\cdot I_0^2 A_0^2}$$\nwhere $k$ is the constant of proportionality.\n$$S_P = \\frac{I_0^2 (2 A_0)^2}{I_0^2 A_0^2} = \\frac{I_0^2 \\cdot 4 A_0^2}{I_0^2 A_0^2} = 4$$\nThe scaling factor for the total radiated power is $4$.\n\nThe final results are:\n- $V_0 = 4\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n- $V_1 = 8\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n- $S_{\\text{DM}} = 2$\n- $S_P = 4$\nThese are to be presented in a row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} V_0 & V_1 & S_{\\text{DM}} & S_P \\end{pmatrix}$.",

The angular mains frequency is $\\omega_m = 2\\pi f_m = 2\\pi(50 \\,\\mathrm{Hz}) = 100\\pi \\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$.\n$$C_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{lim}}}{\\omega_m V_m} = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\,\\mathrm{A}}{(100\\pi \\,\\mathrm{rad/s})(230 \\,\\mathrm{V})} = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{-4}}{23000\\pi} \\,\\mathrm{F}$$\nNumerically, $C_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\approx 6.9196 \\times 10^{-9} \\,\\mathrm{F}$, or $6.9196 \\,\\mathrm{nF}$.\nThe value of a single Y-capacitor is half of the total:\n$$C_y = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{2} = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{-4}}{46000\\pi} \\,\\mathrm{F} \\approx 3.4598 \\times 10^{-9} \\,\\mathrm{F}$$\nRounding to $3$ significant figures, $C_y = 3.46 \\,\\mathrm{nF}$.\n\n**3. Calculation of Inductance ($L_{\\mathrm{cm}}$)**\n\nThe attenuation target is $|H(\\omega_0)| = 0.1$ at the frequency $f_0 = 150 \\,\\mathrm{kHz}$, which corresponds to an angular frequency of $\\omega_0 = 2\\pi f_0 = 2\\pi(150 \\times 10^3 \\,\\mathrm{Hz}) = 3 \\times 10^5 \\pi \\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$.\nWe set up the equation using the derived magnitude expression:\n$$0.1 = \\frac{R_L}{\\sqrt{R_L^2(1 - \\omega_0^2 L_{\\mathrm{cm}} C_{\\mathrm{tot}})^2 + \\omega_0^2 L_{\\mathrm{cm}}^2}}$$\nSquaring both sides gives:\n$$0.01 = \\frac{R_L^2}{R_L^2(1 - \\omega_0^2 L_{\\mathrm{cm}} C_{\\mathrm{tot}})^2 + \\omega_0^2 L_{\\mathrm{cm}}^2}$$\nRearranging the equation:\n$$R_L^2(1 - \\omega_0^2 L_{\\mathrm{cm}} C_{\\mathrm{tot}})^2 + \\omega_0^2 L_{\\mathrm{cm}}^2 = \\frac{R_L^2}{0.01} = 100 R_L^2$$\nLet $x = L_{\\mathrm{cm}}$ and divide by $R_L^2$:\n$$(1 - \\omega_0^2 x C_{\\mathrm{tot}})^2 + \\frac{\\omega_0^2}{R_L^2} x^2 = 100$$\nExpanding the squared term and rearranging gives a quadratic equation in the form $Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0$:\n$$1 - 2\\omega_0^2 C_{\\mathrm{tot}} x + \\omega_0^4 C_{\\mathrm{tot}}^2 x^2 + \\frac{\\omega_0^2}{R_L^2} x^2 = 100$$\n$$\\left(\\omega_0^4 C_{\\mathrm{tot}}^2 + \\frac{\\omega_0^2}{R_L^2}\\right) x^2 - \\left(2\\omega_0^2 C_{\\mathrm{tot}}\\right) x - 99 = 0$$\nWe now substitute the known values to find the coefficients:\n- $\\omega_0 = 3 \\times 10^5 \\pi \\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$\n- $C_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{-4}}{23000\\pi} \\,\\mathrm{F}$\n- $R_L = 25 \\,\\Omega$\n\nThe coefficients are:\n- $A = \\omega_0^4 C_{\\mathrm{tot}}^2 + \\frac{\\omega_0^2}{R_L^2} = \\left((3 \\times 10^5 \\pi)^2 \\frac{5 \\times 10^{-4}}{23000\\pi}\\right)^2 + \\frac{(3 \\times 10^5 \\pi)^2}{25^2} \\approx 1.4589 \\times 10^9$\n- $B = -2\\omega_0^2 C_{\\mathrm{tot}} = -2(3 \\times 10^5 \\pi)^2 \\frac{5 \\times 10^{-4}}{23000\\pi} \\approx -1.2291 \\times 10^4$\n- $C = -99$\n\nWe solve for $x = L_{\\mathrm{cm}}$ using the quadratic formula $x = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}$. Since inductance must be a positive real value, we take the positive root.\n$$L_{\\mathrm{cm}} = \\frac{1.2291 \\times 10^4 + \\sqrt{(-1.2291 \\times 10^4)^2 - 4(1.4589 \\times 10^9)(-99)}}{2(1.4589 \\times 10^9)}$$\n$$L_{\\mathrm{cm}} = \\frac{1.2291 \\times 10^4 + \\sqrt{1.5107 \\times 10^8 + 5.7773 \\times 10^{11}}}{2.9178 \\times 10^9}$$\n$$L_{\\mathrm{cm}} = \\frac{1.2291 \\times 10^4 + 7.5990 \\times 10^5}{2.9178 \\times 10^9} = \\frac{7.7219 \\times 10^5}{2.9178 \\times 10^9} \\approx 2.6465 \\times 10^{-4} \\,\\mathrm{H}$$\nConverting to millihenries ($\\mathrm{mH}$):\n$$L_{\\mathrm{cm}} \\approx 0.26465 \\,\\mathrm{mH}$$\nRounding to $3$ significant figures, $L_{\\mathrm{cm}} = 0.265 \\,\\mathrm{mH}$.\n\nThe required values are $L_{\\mathrm{cm}} = 0.265 \\,\\mathrm{mH}$ and $C_{y} = 3.46 \\,\\mathrm{nF}$.",
