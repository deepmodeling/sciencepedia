            "introduction": "One of the most critical limitations of current-mode control is its susceptibility to subharmonic oscillation, a classic instability in sampled-data systems. This practice delves into the stability analysis for a boost converter, where the condition for stability is notably more complex than in a buck converter due to the duty-cycle dependence of the inductor current's down-slope. By deriving the necessary slope compensation from first principles, you will gain a deep, analytical understanding of why this instability occurs and how the corrective ramp restores stable operation .",

            "problem": "An ideal boost converter operating in Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM) is controlled by peak current-mode control (CMC) using trailing-edge Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). The inductor current is sensed perfectly and an artificial compensation ramp of slope $m_{a}$ (in $\\mathrm{A/s}$) is added to the sensed current for subharmonic stabilization. The switching period is $T_{s}$, the inductance is $L$, and the input voltage is $V_{g}$. Assume the standard ideal boost relation $V_{o} = V_{g}/(1 - D)$, where $V_{o}$ is the steady-state output voltage and $D \\in (0,1)$ is the duty cycle. Over one switching cycle, the inductor current increases during the on-time with slope $m_{1} = V_{g}/L$ and decreases during the off-time with slope magnitude $m_{2} = (V_{o} - V_{g})/L = V_{g}D/\\big(L(1 - D)\\big)$.\n\nStarting from first principles of sampled-data dynamics in current-mode control—namely, the piecewise-linear evolution of the inductor current within a cycle and the comparator timing set by the intersection of the compensated current signal with a fixed control reference—derive the one-cycle perturbation map for the valley current and impose the discrete-time stability requirement necessary to eliminate subharmonic oscillation. From this derivation, obtain the minimum required artificial ramp slope $m_{a,\\min}(D)$ as an explicit analytic function of $D$, $V_{g}$, and $L$, and justify why the requirement is duty-dependent for the boost converter. Express your final answer for $m_{a,\\min}(D)$ in $\\mathrm{A/s}$ as a single closed-form expression. No numerical evaluation is required, and no rounding is needed. Use only the given ideal relations and definitions; do not assume any additional compensation beyond the single linear ramp of slope $m_{a}$ added to the sensed current.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the minimum required compensation ramp slope, $m_{a,\\min}(D)$, for a boost converter under peak current-mode control to ensure stability against subharmonic oscillations. The derivation must start from the first principles of sampled-data dynamics.\n\nLet us model the system's behavior over one switching cycle, denoted by index $k$. The switching period is $T_s$. The inductor current at the beginning of the cycle (the valley current) is $i_v[k]$, and the duty cycle for this cycle is $d[k]$. The control variable is the duty cycle, which is determined by the control circuit. In trailing-edge PWM, the power switch is turned on at the beginning of the cycle and turned off at time $t = d[k]T_s$.\n\nThe inductor current $i_L(t)$ during the on-time ($0 \\le t \\le d[k]T_s$) increases with a slope $m_1 = V_g/L$. Thus, the current at time $t$ is:\n$$i_L(t) = i_v[k] + m_1 t$$\nThe control scheme is peak current-mode control with an added compensation ramp. The compensation signal is an artificial current ramp $i_a(t) = m_a t$. The PWM comparator terminates the on-time when the sum of the sensed inductor current and the compensation ramp reaches a fixed reference level, $I_{ref}$.\nThe turn-off condition at time $t_k = d[k]T_s$ is:\n$$i_L(t_k) + i_a(t_k) = I_{ref}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $i_L(t)$ and $i_a(t)$:\n$$(i_v[k] + m_1 d[k]T_s) + m_a d[k]T_s = I_{ref}$$\n$$i_v[k] + (m_1 + m_a)d[k]T_s = I_{ref}$$\nThis equation defines the relationship between the initial current $i_v[k]$ and the resulting duty cycle $d[k]$.\n\nTo analyze stability, we linearize this system around a steady-state operating point defined by a constant duty cycle $D$ and a constant valley current $I_v$. Let $i_v[k] = I_v + \\hat{i}_v[k]$ and $d[k] = D + \\hat{d}[k]$, where $\\hat{i}_v[k]$ and $\\hat{d}[k]$ are small perturbations.\nThe steady-state condition is:\n$$I_v + (m_1 + m_a)DT_s = I_{ref}$$\nSubstituting the perturbed variables into the turn-off condition equation:\n$$(I_v + \\hat{i}_v[k]) + (m_1 + m_a)(D + \\hat{d}[k])T_s = I_{ref}$$\nExpanding this and subtracting the steady-state equation yields the small-signal relationship:\n$$\\hat{i}_v[k] + (m_1 + m_a)\\hat{d}[k]T_s = 0$$\nFrom this, we can express the duty cycle perturbation in terms of the valley current perturbation:\n$$\\hat{d}[k]T_s = -\\frac{\\hat{i}_v[k]}{m_1 + m_a}$$\n\nNext, we establish the evolution of the valley current from one cycle to the next. The valley current of the next cycle, $i_v[k+1]$, is equal to the inductor current at the end of the current cycle, $t=T_s$.\nDuring the off-time ($d[k]T_s \\le t \\le T_s$), the inductor current decreases with a slope of magnitude $m_2 = (V_o - V_g)/L$.\nThe peak current at $t_k=d[k]T_s$ is $i_{pk}[k] = i_v[k] + m_1 d[k]T_s$.\nThe current at the end of the cycle is:\n$$i_v[k+1] = i_{pk}[k] - m_2(T_s - d[k]T_s) = (i_v[k] + m_1 d[k]T_s) - m_2 T_s(1 - d[k])$$\n$$i_v[k+1] = i_v[k] + (m_1 + m_2)d[k]T_s - m_2 T_s$$\nWe now linearize this equation. The steady-state condition is $I_v = I_v + (m_1+m_2)DT_s - m_2T_s$, which simplifies to $m_1 D = m_2(1-D)$. This is the correct volt-second balance for the inductor in an ideal converter.\nSubstituting the perturbed variables $i_v[k+1]=I_v+\\hat{i}_v[k+1]$, $i_v[k]=I_v+\\hat{i}_v[k]$, and $d[k]=D+\\hat{d}[k]$:\n$$I_v + \\hat{i}_v[k+1] = (I_v + \\hat{i}_v[k]) + (m_1+m_2)(D+\\hat{d}[k])T_s - m_2 T_s$$\nSubtracting the steady-state equation gives the small-signal model for the valley current propagation:\n$$\\hat{i}_v[k+1] = \\hat{i}_v[k] + (m_1+m_2)\\hat{d}[k]T_s$$\nThis equation describes how the valley current perturbation evolves from cycle $k$ to cycle $k+1$.\n\nNow, we combine the two derived small-signal equations. Substitute the expression for $\\hat{d}[k]T_s$ into the valley current propagation equation:\n$$\\hat{i}_v[k+1] = \\hat{i}_v[k] + (m_1+m_2)\\left(-\\frac{\\hat{i}_v[k]}{m_1 + m_a}\\right)$$\n$$\\hat{i}_v[k+1] = \\left(1 - \\frac{m_1 + m_2}{m_1 + m_a}\\right) \\hat{i}_v[k]$$\nThis is a first-order linear discrete-time system of the form $\\hat{i}_v[k+1] = A \\cdot \\hat{i}_v[k]$, where the characteristic multiplier (eigenvalue) is $A = 1 - \\frac{m_1 + m_2}{m_1 + m_a}$.\nFor the system to be stable, the magnitude of this eigenvalue must be less than $1$, i.e., $|A|  1$, which is equivalent to $-1  A  1$.\n\nLet's analyze the inequality $-1  A  1$:\n$$-1  1 - \\frac{m_1 + m_2}{m_1 + m_a}  1$$\nThe right-hand side of the inequality is $1 - \\frac{m_1 + m_2}{m_1 + m_a}  1$, which simplifies to $-\\frac{m_1 + m_2}{m_1 + m_a}  0$. Since the slopes $m_1$, $m_2$, and $m_a$ are all non-negative (with $m_1 > 0$), this condition is always satisfied.\nThe critical condition for stability is the left-hand side of the inequality, which prevents period-doubling bifurcation (subharmonic oscillation):\n$$-1  1 - \\frac{m_1 + m_2}{m_1 + m_a}$$\n$$\\frac{m_1 + m_2}{m_1 + m_a}  2$$\n$$m_1 + m_2  2(m_1 + m_a)$$\n$$m_1 + m_2  2m_1 + 2m_a$$\n$$m_2 - m_1  2m_a$$\n$$m_a > \\frac{m_2 - m_1}{2}$$\nThis is the condition that the artificial ramp slope $m_a$ must satisfy to ensure stability. The minimum required slope is therefore the boundary of this condition. However, we must consider the case where the system is inherently stable.\nThe quantity $m_2 - m_1$ determines the natural stability. If $m_2 - m_1  0$, the condition $m_a > \\text{(negative value)}$ is satisfied even for $m_a = 0$. In this case, no compensation is needed, and the minimum required slope is $m_{a,\\min} = 0$.\nIf $m_2 - m_1 > 0$, an external ramp is necessary, and the minimum slope is $m_{a,\\min} = (m_2-m_1)/2$.\nWe can combine these two cases using the maximum function:\n$$m_{a,\\min} = \\max\\left(0, \\frac{m_2 - m_1}{2}\\right)$$\nNow, we express this in terms of the given parameters $D$, $V_g$, and $L$.\nWe are given $m_1 = \\frac{V_g}{L}$ and $m_2 = \\frac{V_g D}{L(1-D)}$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $m_{a,\\min}$:\n$$\\frac{m_2 - m_1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{V_g D}{L(1-D)} - \\frac{V_g}{L}\\right) = \\frac{V_g}{2L}\\left(\\frac{D}{1-D} - 1\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{m_2 - m_1}{2} = \\frac{V_g}{2L}\\left(\\frac{D - (1-D)}{1-D}\\right) = \\frac{V_g}{2L}\\frac{2D-1}{1-D}$$\nThus, the minimum required artificial ramp slope is:\n$$m_{a,\\min}(D) = \\max\\left(0, \\frac{V_g(2D-1)}{2L(1-D)}\\right)$$\n\nThe requirement for the compensation ramp is duty-dependent because one of the fundamental dynamic characteristics of the converter, the inductor current down-slope $m_2$, is a function of the duty cycle $D$. Specifically, $m_2 = (V_o - V_g)/L$. For an ideal boost converter, the output voltage is $V_o = V_g/(1-D)$, which makes $m_2 = (V_g/(1-D) - V_g)/L = V_g D / (L(1-D))$. This slope increases non-linearly as $D$ increases. The stability of the current loop depends on the relative magnitudes of the up-slope $m_1$ (which is constant for a given $V_g$) and the down-slope $m_2$.\nFor duty cycles $D  0.5$, we find that $m_2  m_1$, and the term $(m_2-m_1)/2$ is negative. The system is inherently stable, and no compensation is required ($m_{a,\\min}=0$).\nFor duty cycles $D > 0.5$, we find that $m_2 > m_1$. This condition leads to an amplification of perturbations from one cycle to the next, causing subharmonic oscillation. An external compensation ramp is required to counteract this amplification. The magnitude of the required compensation, $m_{a,\\min}$, depends directly on the difference $m_2 - m_1$, which itself is a direct function of the duty cycle $D$. Consequently, the stability requirement is fundamentally duty-dependent.",

Consequently, the true peak inductor current $i_{L}(t_{\\text{trip}})$ will be less than the target peak current $I_{\\text{pk}}$. This phenomenon is an **undershoot** of the inductor current peak relative to the reference.\nThe measurement error, $\\Delta I_{\\text{error}}$, which is the magnitude of this undershoot, is equal to the residual spike amplitude at the moment of tripping:\n$$\\Delta I_{\\text{error}} = I_{\\text{pk}} - i_{L}(t_{\\text{trip}}) = i_{\\text{sp}}(t_{\\text{trip}})$$\nThe function $i_{\\text{sp}}(t)$ is monotonically decreasing for $t>0$. The blanking time $t_{b,\\min}$ sets the earliest possible trip time. Therefore, the worst-case (maximum) error occurs for the smallest possible trip time, i.e., if the controller were to trip exactly at $t_{\\text{trip}} = t_{b,\\min}$.\nThe worst-case peak error is thus:\n$$\\Delta I_{\\text{error, max}} = i_{\\text{sp}}(t_{b,\\min})$$\nFrom the design requirement for $t_{b,\\min}$, we have:\n$$\\Delta I_{\\text{error, max}} = \\epsilon I_{\\text{pk}} = 0.01 \\times 20\\,\\mathrm{A} = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{A}$$\nSo, the chosen blanking window introduces an undershoot in the peak inductor current. The worst-case magnitude of this undershoot is $0.2\\,\\mathrm{A}$, occurring if the trip point coincides with the end of the blanking interval. This corresponds to an actual peak inductor current of $19.8\\,\\mathrm{A}$ instead of the desired $20\\,\\mathrm{A}$. For any trip that occurs after $t_{b,min}$, the error will be smaller than $0.2\\,\\mathrm{A}$.\n\nThe question asks for the minimum blanking time $t_{b,\\min}$ as the final answer, rounded to three significant figures.\n$$t_{b,\\min} = 100\\,\\mathrm{ns}$$",
