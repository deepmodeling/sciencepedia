            "solution": "The problem statement is a standard exercise in the analysis of DC-DC converters, specifically the boost converter. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of circuit theory and power electronics, well-posed, and uses precise, objective language. All necessary parameters for an ideal model are provided. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe solution is approached in two parts as requested by the problem: first, the derivation of the boundary condition between Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM) and Discontinuous Conduction Mode (DCM), and second, the analysis of the duty-to-output transfer function's zero in both modes.\n\n**Part 1: CCM/DCM Boundary Condition**\n\nThe boost converter operates at the boundary between CCM and DCM when the minimum value of the inductor current over a switching cycle, $I_{L,min}$, is exactly zero.\n\nIn steady-state CCM, the average voltage across the inductor over one switching period $T_s$ is zero. This leads to the ideal voltage gain relationship:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{out}} = \\dfrac{V_{\\mathrm{in}}}{1-D}$$\nwhere $V_{\\mathrm{in}}$ is the input voltage, $V_{\\mathrm{out}}$ is the output voltage, and $D$ is the duty ratio.\n\nThe average inductor current, $I_L$, for an ideal converter can be found through power balance, $P_{\\mathrm{in}} = P_{\\mathrm{out}}$.\n$$V_{\\mathrm{in}} I_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\dfrac{V_{\\mathrm{out}}^2}{R}$$\nSince the average input current $I_{\\mathrm{in}}$ is equal to the average inductor current $I_L$, we have:\n$$I_L = I_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\dfrac{V_{\\mathrm{out}}^2}{V_{\\mathrm{in}} R} = \\dfrac{1}{V_{\\mathrm{in}} R} \\left( \\dfrac{V_{\\mathrm{in}}}{1-D} \\right)^2 = \\dfrac{V_{\\mathrm{in}}}{R(1-D)^2}$$\n\nThe inductor current ripple, $\\Delta i_{L,pp}$, is the change in current during the switch-on period ($DT_s$).\n$$v_L = L \\dfrac{di_L}{dt} = V_{\\mathrm{in}} \\quad \\text{for } 0  t \\le DT_s$$\n$$\\Delta i_{L,pp} = \\dfrac{V_{\\mathrm{in}}}{L} DT_s$$\nThe inductor current waveform is triangular, centered around the average current $I_L$. The minimum inductor current is:\n$$I_{L,min} = I_L - \\dfrac{\\Delta i_{L,pp}}{2}$$\nThe CCM/DCM boundary condition is $I_{L,min} = 0$, which implies:\n$$I_L = \\dfrac{\\Delta i_{L,pp}}{2}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $I_L$ and $\\Delta i_{L,pp}$:\n$$\\dfrac{V_{\\mathrm{in}}}{R(1-D)^2} = \\dfrac{1}{2} \\left( \\dfrac{V_{\\mathrm{in}}DT_s}{L} \\right)$$\nThe resistance $R$ at which this boundary condition occurs is the critical resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{crit}}(D)$. Solving for $R_{\\mathrm{crit}}(D)$:\n$$\\dfrac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{crit}}(D)(1-D)^2} = \\dfrac{DT_s}{2L}$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{crit}}(D) = \\dfrac{2L}{DT_s (1-D)^2}$$\n\n**Part 2: Zero Location in CCM and its Behavior in DCM**\n\nTo find the zero of the duty-to-output transfer function, $G_{vd}(s) = \\hat{v}_{\\mathrm{out}}(s) / \\hat{d}(s)$, we use the state-space averaged model for the converter in CCM. The state vector is $x = [i_L, v_C]^T$. The averaged state equations for small-signal perturbations around a steady-state operating point $(I_L, V_C)$ are given by:\n$$\\dot{\\hat{x}} = A \\hat{x} + B_d \\hat{d}$$\nwhere the system matrix $A$ and the control input matrix $B_d$ are:\n$$A = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  -\\frac{1-D}{L} \\\\ \\frac{1-D}{C}  -\\frac{1}{RC} \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad B_d = \\begin{bmatrix} V_C/L \\\\ -I_L/C \\end{bmatrix}$$\nThe output equation is $\\hat{y} = \\hat{v}_C = C_{\\text{ss}}\\hat{x}$, with $C_{\\text{ss}} = [0, 1]$.\n\nThe transfer function from duty cycle to output voltage is $G_{vd}(s) = C_{\\text{ss}} (sI - A)^{-1} B_d$. The zeros of this transfer function are the roots of the numerator polynomial, which is given by $\\det \\begin{bmatrix} sI-A  B_d \\\\ -C_{\\text{ss}}  0 \\end{bmatrix}$. A more direct method is to compute the numerator of $C_{\\text{ss}} \\cdot \\mathrm{adj}(sI-A) \\cdot B_d$.\n$$sI - A = \\begin{bmatrix} s  \\frac{1-D}{L} \\\\ -\\frac{1-D}{C}  s+\\frac{1}{RC} \\end{bmatrix}$$\n$$\\mathrm{adj}(sI - A) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+\\frac{1}{RC}  -\\frac{1-D}{L} \\\\ \\frac{1-D}{C}  s \\end{bmatrix}$$\nThe numerator of $G_{vd}(s)$ is proportional to:\n$N(s) = C_{\\text{ss}} \\cdot \\mathrm{adj}(sI-A) \\cdot B_d = [0, 1] \\begin{bmatrix} s+\\frac{1}{RC}  -\\frac{1-D}{L} \\\\ \\frac{1-D}{C}  s \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} V_C/L \\\\ -I_L/C \\end{bmatrix}$\n$$N(s) = \\left[\\frac{1-D}{C}, s\\right] \\begin{bmatrix} V_C/L \\\\ -I_L/C \\end{bmatrix} = \\dfrac{(1-D)V_C}{LC} - s\\dfrac{I_L}{C}$$\nThe zero $s_z$ is found by setting $N(s_z) = 0$:\n$$s_z \\dfrac{I_L}{C} = \\dfrac{(1-D)V_C}{LC} \\implies s_z = \\dfrac{(1-D)V_C}{L I_L}$$\nSubstituting the steady-state (DC) values $V_C = V_{\\mathrm{out}} = V_{\\mathrm{in}}/(1-D)$ and $I_L = V_{\\mathrm{in}}/(R(1-D)^2)$:\n$$s_z = \\dfrac{(1-D)}{L} \\dfrac{V_{\\mathrm{in}}/(1-D)}{V_{\\mathrm{in}}/(R(1-D)^2)} = \\dfrac{(1-D)}{L} \\dfrac{V_{\\mathrm{in}}}{1-D} \\dfrac{R(1-D)^2}{V_{\\mathrm{in}}} = \\dfrac{R(1-D)^2}{L}$$\nSince $R0$, $L0$, and $D \\in (0,1)$, the zero $s_z$ is a positive real number. This corresponds to a zero in the right-half-plane (RHP), located at an angular frequency of $\\omega_z = s_z = \\dfrac{R(1-D)^2}{L}$. The presence of this RHP zero makes the system non-minimum phase.\n\nWhen the converter crosses into DCM (for loads $R  R_{\\mathrm{crit}}$), the dynamics change fundamentally. In DCM, the inductor current is zero for a portion of the switching cycle. The inductor's energy is completely transferred to the output capacitor and load before the next cycle begins. The state of the inductor \"resets\" to zero in every cycle. This eliminates the dynamic coupling that causes the non-minimum phase behavior. An increase in the duty cycle $D$ leads to a larger packet of energy being transferred to the output in that same cycle, resulting in a monotonic increase in the output voltage. The initial voltage dip characteristic of the RHP zero in CCM does not occur. Therefore, in DCM, the boost converter becomes a minimum-phase system, and the RHP zero disappears under ideal assumptions.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n*   **A. $R_{\\mathrm{crit}}(D) = \\dfrac{2L}{D T_s (1-D)^2}$; in CCM the duty-to-output transfer has a RHP zero at $\\omega_z = \\dfrac{R(1-D)^2}{L}$; in DCM this zero disappears and the converter becomes minimum phase under ideal assumptions.**\n    -   The formula for $R_{\\mathrm{crit}}(D)$ is correct as derived.\n    -   The location of the RHP zero in CCM is correct as derived.\n    -   The statement that the zero disappears in DCM, making the system minimum phase, is also correct.\n    -   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. $R_{\\mathrm{crit}}(D) = \\dfrac{L}{T_s(1-D)}$; in CCM the duty-to-output transfer has a left-half-plane zero at $\\omega_z = \\dfrac{L}{R(1-D)^2}$; crossing to DCM flips the zero to the right half-plane.**\n    -   The formula for $R_{\\mathrm{crit}}(D)$ is incorrect.\n    -   The zero in a boost converter in CCM is in the RHP, not the LHP. The formula provided for $\\omega_z$ is also incorrect (it is inverted and missing a factor of $R^2$).\n    -   Crossing to DCM removes the RHP zero; it does not introduce one or flip one from the LHP to the RHP.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. $R_{\\mathrm{crit}}(D) = \\dfrac{2L}{T_s}$ (independent of $D$); in CCM the duty-to-output zero is at $\\omega_z = \\dfrac{1}{RL}$ (independent of $D$); crossing into DCM does not affect zero location.**\n    -   $R_{\\mathrm{crit}}(D)$ is strongly dependent on $D$, so this formula is incorrect.\n    -   The zero location $\\omega_z$ is dependent on $D$, so this formula is incorrect.\n    -   Crossing into DCM fundamentally changes the system dynamics and removes the RHP zero, so the claim that the location is unaffected is incorrect.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. For a buck converter, $R_{\\mathrm{crit}}(D) = \\dfrac{2L}{(1-D)T_s}$; crossing into DCM introduces a RHP zero that is absent in CCM.**\n    -   This option addresses a buck converter, not the boost converter specified in the problem statement. Therefore, it does not answer the question.\n    -   Furthermore, the claims made about the buck converter are only partially correct. The formula for $R_{\\mathrm{crit}}(D)$ is correct for a buck converter. However, a buck converter is minimum-phase in both CCM and DCM; it does not gain a RHP zero when crossing into DCM.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

There are no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a standard exercise in applying control theory principles to a power electronics system. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe solution is presented in three parts as requested: derivation of the inequality, interpretation, and numerical calculation.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Inequality**\n\nLet $r(t)$ be the reference signal and $y(t)$ be the normalized output. The tracking error is $e(t) = r(t) - y(t)$. The input is a unit step, so $r(t)=1$ for $t \\geq 0$. Thus, $e(t) = 1 - y(t)$. We work in the Laplace domain, where the Laplace transforms of the signals are denoted by the corresponding capital letters: $R(s)$, $Y(s)$, and $E(s)$.\n\nThe Laplace transform of the unit step reference is $R(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{1\\} = \\frac{1}{s}$.\nThe closed-loop transfer function from the reference to the output is the complementary sensitivity function, $T(s)$. In the Laplace domain, the output is given by $Y(s) = T(s)R(s) = T(s) \\frac{1}{s}$.\n\nThe Laplace transform of the tracking error $e(t)$ is:\n$$\nE(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{e(t)\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\{1 - y(t)\\} = R(s) - Y(s) = \\frac{1}{s} - \\frac{T(s)}{s} = \\frac{1-T(s)}{s}\n$$\nThe problem states that the duty-to-output plant, let's call it $P(s)$, has a right-half-plane (RHP) zero at $s=z_{RHP}$, where $z_{RHP} > 0$. This means $P(z_{RHP}) = 0$.\n\nThe complementary sensitivity function is related to the plant $P(s)$ and the compensator $C(s)$ by $T(s) = \\frac{P(s)C(s)}{1+P(s)C(s)}$. We evaluate $T(s)$ at the RHP zero, $s=z_{RHP}$:\n$$\nT(z_{RHP}) = \\frac{P(z_{RHP})C(z_{RHP})}{1+P(z_{RHP})C(z_{RHP})}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the closed-loop system is internally stable. A key requirement for internal stability is the absence of pole-zero cancellations in the RHP. Since the plant has a zero at $z_{RHP}$, the compensator $C(s)$ cannot have a pole at $s=z_{RHP}$. Therefore, $C(z_{RHP})$ must be a finite complex number. With $P(z_{RHP})=0$ and $C(z_{RHP})$ being finite, the expression for $T(z_{RHP})$ becomes:\n$$\nT(z_{RHP}) = \\frac{0 \\cdot C(z_{RHP})}{1+0 \\cdot C(z_{RHP})} = \\frac{0}{1} = 0\n$$\nThis is a fundamental interpolation constraint imposed by the RHP zero on any stabilizing controller for this plant.\n\nThe integral to be evaluated is $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e(t)\\,\\exp(-z_{RHP} t)\\,dt$. By the definition of the Laplace transform, this integral is precisely the Laplace transform of the error, $E(s)$, evaluated at $s=z_{RHP}$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e(t)\\,\\exp(-z_{RHP} t)\\,dt = E(z_{RHP})\n$$\nThe stability of the closed-loop system ensures that $e(t) \\to 0$ as $t \\to \\infty$, which guarantees that the region of convergence for $E(s)$ includes the entire right-half plane, so $E(z_{RHP})$ is well-defined.\n\nWe now substitute $s=z_{RHP}$ into the expression for $E(s)$:\n$$\nE(z_{RHP}) = \\frac{1-T(z_{RHP})}{z_{RHP}}\n$$\nUsing the result $T(z_{RHP})=0$, we find:\n$$\nE(z_{RHP}) = \\frac{1-0}{z_{RHP}} = \\frac{1}{z_{RHP}}\n$$\nThis establishes the equality:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e(t)\\,\\exp(-z_{RHP} t)\\,dt = \\frac{1}{z_{RHP}}\n$$\nSince for any two real numbers $A$ and $B$, the statement $A=B$ implies $A \\geq B$, proving the equality is sufficient to show the requested inequality. Thus, we have shown that:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e(t)\\,\\exp(-z_{RHP} t)\\,dt \\geq \\frac{1}{z_{RHP}}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Interpretation of the Result**\n\nThe derived identity, $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} (1-y(t))\\,\\exp(-z_{RHP} t)\\,dt = \\frac{1}{z_{RHP}}$, represents a fundamental performance limitation. The term $\\exp(-z_{RHP}t)$ is a positive, decaying weighting function. The integral represents the exponentially weighted net area of the tracking error.\n\nTo understand its implication for undershoot, we can rewrite the identity by splitting the integral:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-z_{RHP} t)\\,dt - \\int_{0}^{\\infty} y(t)\\,\\exp(-z_{RHP} t)\\,dt = \\frac{1}{z_{RHP}}\n$$\nThe first term evaluates to $\\frac{1}{z_{RHP}}$. This implies that the second term must be zero:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} y(t)\\,\\exp(-z_{RHP} t)\\,dt = 0\n$$\nThis powerful result states that the exponentially weighted integral of the output response $y(t)$ must be zero. The step response starts at $y(0)=0$ (as the controller is strictly proper and the plant has a relative degree of at least 1) and must end at $y(\\infty)=1$. For the weighted integral to be zero, the function $y(t)$ cannot be positive for all $t0$. It must assume negative values for some duration to balance the positive area it amasses as it approaches the final value of $1$. This necessary phase of negative output, $y(t)0$, is the undershoot.\n\nThe quantity $\\frac{1}{z_{RHP}}$ therefore provides a quantitative measure of this trade-off. A smaller value of $z_{RHP}$ (a zero closer to the origin) implies a larger value for the integral constraint, signifying a more severe performance limitation and a more pronounced undershoot characteristic in the step response.\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Calculation**\n\nGiven the parameters for the boost converter:\n-   Inductance, $L = 250\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{H}$\n-   Load resistance, $R = 20\\ \\Omega$\n-   Nominal duty ratio, $D = 0.6$\n\nFirst, we compute the location of the RHP zero, $z_{RHP}$:\n$$\nz_{RHP} = \\frac{R(1-D)^{2}}{L} = \\frac{(20\\ \\Omega)(1-0.6)^{2}}{250\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{H}}\n$$\n$$\nz_{RHP} = \\frac{20 \\cdot (0.4)^{2}}{250 \\times 10^{-6}} = \\frac{20 \\cdot 0.16}{250 \\times 10^{-6}} = \\frac{3.2}{250 \\times 10^{-6}}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nz_{RHP} = 12800\\ \\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe lower bound on the exponentially weighted integral of the tracking error is given by $U_{\\exp,\\min}=\\frac{1}{z_{RHP}}$.\n$$\nU_{\\exp,\\min} = \\frac{1}{12800}\\ \\text{s}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\nU_{\\exp,\\min} = 0.000078125\\ \\text{s}\n$$\nExpressing this in scientific notation and rounding to four significant figures:\n$$\nU_{\\exp,\\min} = 7.8125 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{s} \\approx 7.813 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{s}\n$$",

Second, we design the lead compensator to recover this lost phase and determine the required lead ratio, $\\alpha$.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Phase Margin Lost**\n\nThe problem provides the parameters for a boost converter operating in continuous conduction mode (CCM):\nOutput resistance, $R = 20\\,\\Omega$\nInductor, $L = 200\\,\\mu\\mathrm{H} = 200 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{H}$\nDuty ratio, $D = 0.40$\n\nThe angular frequency of the RHP zero, $\\omega_{z,\\mathrm{RHP}}$, is given by the formula:\n$$ \\omega_{z,\\mathrm{RHP}} = \\frac{R(1 - D)^{2}}{L} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\omega_{z,\\mathrm{RHP}} = \\frac{(20\\,\\Omega)(1 - 0.40)^{2}}{200 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{H}} = \\frac{20 \\cdot (0.60)^{2}}{2 \\times 10^{-4}} = \\frac{20 \\cdot 0.36}{2 \\times 10^{-4}} = \\frac{7.2}{2 \\times 10^{-4}}\\,\\mathrm{rad/s} = 3.6 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{rad/s} $$\n\nThe transfer function of this RHP zero is of the form $G_z(s) = 1 - \\frac{s}{\\omega_{z,\\mathrm{RHP}}}$. The presence of a minus sign, instead of a plus sign as in a left-half-plane (LHP) zero, is what defines it as an RHP zero.\n\nTo find the phase contribution of this zero, we evaluate its frequency response by setting $s = j\\omega$:\n$$ G_z(j\\omega) = 1 - j\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{z,\\mathrm{RHP}}} $$\nThis is a complex number with a real part of $1$ and a negative imaginary part of $-\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{z,\\mathrm{RHP}}}$. From the fundamental geometric interpretation of phase as the argument of a complex number, the phase angle $\\phi_z(\\omega)$ is the angle of the vector from the origin to the point $(1, -\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{z,\\mathrm{RHP}}})$ in the complex plane. This is given by:\n$$ \\phi_z(\\omega) = \\arg\\left(1 - j\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{z,\\mathrm{RHP}}}\\right) = -\\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{z,\\mathrm{RHP}}}\\right) $$\nThis negative phase contribution is a phase lag, which reduces the system's phase margin. The phase margin is measured at the gain crossover frequency, given as $\\omega_c = 1.2 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$. The phase margin lost, $\\Delta\\phi_{\\text{lost}}$, is the magnitude of the phase lag at this frequency.\n$$ \\Delta\\phi_{\\text{lost}} = \\left| \\phi_z(\\omega_c) \\right| = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\omega_c}{\\omega_{z,\\mathrm{RHP}}}\\right) $$\nSubstituting the values for $\\omega_c$ and $\\omega_{z,\\mathrm{RHP}}$:\n$$ \\Delta\\phi_{\\text{lost}} = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{1.2 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}}{3.6 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}}\\right) = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) $$\nTo express this in degrees, we perform the conversion:\n$$ \\Delta\\phi_{\\text{lost, deg}} = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\times \\frac{180^{\\circ}}{\\pi} \\approx 18.435^{\\circ} $$\n\n**Part 2: Design of the Phase-Lead Compensator**\n\nThe objective is to design a phase-lead compensator that adds a phase lead equal to the lost phase margin, $\\Delta\\phi_{\\text{lost}}$, at the crossover frequency $\\omega_c$. The required maximum phase lead, $\\phi_m$, from the compensator must therefore be:\n$$ \\phi_m = \\Delta\\phi_{\\text{lost}} = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) $$\nThe problem specifies that the compensator's maximum phase lead should be centered at $\\omega_c$, meaning the compensator's center frequency $\\omega_m$ is equal to $\\omega_c$.\n\nThe transfer function of the lead compensator is given as $C(s) = K \\frac{1 + sT}{1 + sT/\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha  1$.\nThe phase contribution of this compensator is $\\phi_{\\text{comp}}(\\omega) = \\arctan(\\omega T) - \\arctan(\\omega T/\\alpha)$. This function has a maximum value, $\\phi_m$, which is related to the parameter $\\alpha$ by the standard formula:\n$$ \\sin(\\phi_m) = \\frac{\\alpha - 1}{\\alpha + 1} $$\nWe can algebraically solve for $\\alpha$:\n$$ \\sin(\\phi_m) (\\alpha + 1) = \\alpha - 1 $$\n$$ \\sin(\\phi_m)\\alpha + \\sin(\\phi_m) = \\alpha - 1 $$\n$$ 1 + \\sin(\\phi_m) = \\alpha(1 - \\sin(\\phi_m)) $$\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{1 + \\sin(\\phi_m)}{1 - \\sin(\\phi_m)} $$\nWe need to find the value of $\\sin(\\phi_m)$ where $\\phi_m = \\arctan(1/3)$. We can use the trigonometric identity $\\sin(\\arctan(x)) = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1+x^2}}$.\nLetting $x = 1/3$:\n$$ \\sin(\\phi_m) = \\sin\\left(\\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{1/3}{\\sqrt{1 + (1/3)^2}} = \\frac{1/3}{\\sqrt{1 + 1/9}} = \\frac{1/3}{\\sqrt{10/9}} = \\frac{1/3}{\\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{3}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}} $$\nNow, we substitute this value back into the expression for $\\alpha$:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{1 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}}}{1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{10}+1}{\\sqrt{10}}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{10}-1}{\\sqrt{10}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{10} + 1}{\\sqrt{10} - 1} $$\nTo obtain a numerical value, we can rationalize the denominator:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{\\sqrt{10} + 1}{\\sqrt{10} - 1} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{10} + 1}{\\sqrt{10} + 1} = \\frac{(\\sqrt{10} + 1)^2}{(\\sqrt{10})^2 - 1^2} = \\frac{10 + 2\\sqrt{10} + 1}{10 - 1} = \\frac{11 + 2\\sqrt{10}}{9} $$\nUsing the numerical value for $\\sqrt{10} \\approx 3.162277...$:\n$$ \\alpha \\approx \\frac{11 + 2(3.162277)}{9} = \\frac{11 + 6.324554}{9} = \\frac{17.324554}{9} \\approx 1.92495... $$\n\nFinally, we must check the constraint on the compensator's magnitude boost. The magnitude of the lead compensator at its center frequency $\\omega_m = \\omega_c$ is $|C(j\\omega_m)|/K = \\sqrt{\\alpha}$. The boost in decibels is:\n$$ \\text{Boost}_{\\text{dB}} = 20 \\log_{10}(\\sqrt{\\alpha}) = 10 \\log_{10}(\\alpha) $$\nUsing our calculated value of $\\alpha$:\n$$ \\text{Boost}_{\\text{dB}} \\approx 10 \\log_{10}(1.92495) \\approx 2.844\\,\\mathrm{dB} $$\nSince $2.844\\,\\mathrm{dB}  3\\,\\mathrm{dB}$, the design constraint is satisfied.\n\nThe problem asks for the dimensionless lead ratio $\\alpha$ rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\alpha \\approx 1.92495... \\approx 1.925 $$",
            "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1.925} $$"
