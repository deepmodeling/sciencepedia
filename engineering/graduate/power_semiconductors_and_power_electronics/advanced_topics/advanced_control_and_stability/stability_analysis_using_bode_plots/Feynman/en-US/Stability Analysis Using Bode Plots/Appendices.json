The response is measured and approximated by a series of straight-line asymptotes on a Bode magnitude plot. The plot uses a logarithmic frequency scale for angular frequency $\\omega$ (in rad/s) and magnitude in decibels (dB).\n\nThe characteristics of the asymptotic magnitude plot $|G(j\\omega)|$ are as follows:\n1.  For angular frequencies $\\omega  2$ rad/s, the magnitude is a constant 20 dB.\n2.  At $\\omega = 2$ rad/s, the slope changes from 0 dB/decade to -20 dB/decade.\n3.

The output network is modeled by an inductance-capacitance-resistance network with parameters $L$, $C$, and $R$, and the capacitor has an equivalent series resistance $R_{\\mathrm{ESR}}$. The switching frequency is $f_{s}$, and the pulse-width modulation ramp amplitude is such that the modulator gain is real and positive. The control loop employs a Type III compensator, consisting of an integrator, two identical lead sections, and a high-frequency pole placed well above the crossover frequency to limit noise gain. The control-to-output plant of a voltage-mode buck converter may be modeled, for small-signal analysis around a steady operating point with duty ratio in the linear region, as a second-order low-pass with a numerator zero due to $R_{\\mathrm{ESR}}$. Specifically, the duty-to-output gain has the standard second-order form with natural frequency $\\omega_{o}$ and quality factor $Q$, along with a numerator term from $R_{\\mathrm{ESR}}$. For this design, assume that the ESR zero frequency is sufficiently higher than the desired crossover so that its phase contribution is negligible at the crossover.\n\nYou are given the following component and design specifications, which are physically consistent with a state-of-the-art VRM:\n- Inductance: $L = 3.00 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{H}$.\n- Capacitance: $C = 1.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{F}$.\n- Load resistance at the operating point: $R = 2.00 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\Omega$.\n- Capacitor equivalent series resistance: $R_{\\mathrm{ESR}} = 5.00 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\Omega$.\n- Switching frequency: $f_{s} = 6.00 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$.\n- Desired loop crossover frequency (unity-gain frequency): $f_{c} = 5.00 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$.\n- Desired phase margin: $\\phi_{m}^{\\star} = \\pi/3\\ \\mathrm{rad}$.\n\nDefine the natural frequency and quality factor of the second-order denominator of the control-to-output plant as $\\omega_{o} = 1/\\sqrt{L C}$ and $Q = R \\sqrt{C/L}$.
