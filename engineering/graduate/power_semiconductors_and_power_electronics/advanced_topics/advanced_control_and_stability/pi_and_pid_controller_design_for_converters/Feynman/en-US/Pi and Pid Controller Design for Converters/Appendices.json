Different converter topologies, while all managing power flow, can have vastly different dynamic responses. This practice challenges you to compare the step response of a buck (minimum-phase) and a boost (non-minimum-phase) converter, prompting you to reason from first principles about why one exhibits a direct response while the other shows an initial \"inverse\" response .",

            "problem": "A direct current to direct current conversion system implements two topologies in continuous conduction mode: a step-down (buck) converter and a step-up (boost) converter. Both converters operate with a switching frequency sufficiently high to justify state-space averaging and linear small-signal modeling (assume switching frequency is much higher than the dominant plant poles). Each converter uses the same Proportional-Integral (PI) controller with proportional gain $K_{p}$ and integral gain $K_{i}$, and both are commanded by a small positive step in the reference output voltage.\n\nBuck plant parameters: input voltage $V_{g,\\mathrm{buck}} = 24\\,\\mathrm{V}$, inductor $L_{\\mathrm{buck}} = 200\\,\\mu\\mathrm{H}$, capacitor $C_{\\mathrm{buck}} = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{F}$ with equivalent series resistance $r_{c,\\mathrm{buck}} = 50\\,\\mathrm{m}\\Omega$, load $R_{\\mathrm{buck}} = 12\\,\\Omega$, nominal duty $D_{\\mathrm{buck}} = 0.5$.\n\nBoost plant parameters: input voltage $V_{g,\\mathrm{boost}} = 12\\,\\mathrm{V}$, inductor $L_{\\mathrm{boost}} = 200\\,\\mu\\mathrm{H}$, capacitor $C_{\\mathrm{boost}} = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{F}$ with equivalent series resistance $r_{c,\\mathrm{boost}} = 50\\,\\mathrm{m}\\Omega$, load $R_{\\mathrm{boost}} = 24\\,\\Omega$, nominal duty $D_{\\mathrm{boost}} = 0.5$.\n\nThe PI controller is identical in both loops: $K_{p} = 0.25$ and $K_{i} = 1500\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, implemented in a standard voltage-mode configuration around the duty-to-output small-signal plant.\n\nStarting from first principles, use the inductor law $v_{L} = L\\,di_{L}/dt$, the capacitor law $i_{C} = C\\,dv_{o}/dt$, and the averaged switch network behavior for each topology to reason about the sign and qualitative shape of the closed-loop output voltage step response in each case under the same PI parameters. In particular, consider the instantaneous redistribution of currents between the inductor, diode/switch, and capacitor when the duty cycle $D$ increases.\n\nWhich of the following statements are correct about the resulting step responses and the fundamental cause for any observed undershoot or inverse response?\n\nA. With the same PI controller, the buck converter exhibits a monotonic rise (no inverse response) to a small positive reference step, whereas the boost converter exhibits an initial dip (undershoot) before rising, because the boost plant is non-minimum-phase due to a right-half-plane zero in its control-to-output transfer function that reflects its energy-transfer mechanism.\n\nB. If the proportional and integral gains are identical, both buck and boost closed-loop step responses are identical because the controller dynamics dominate the plant and eliminate topology-specific effects.\n\nC. The undershoot observed in the boost converter under a positive duty or reference step is caused solely by the capacitor equivalent series resistance; if $r_{c} \\to 0$, the inverse response disappears irrespective of duty cycle and load.\n\nD. The inverse response in the boost converter is fundamentally due to the fact that increasing the duty cycle initially reduces instantaneous power delivery to the output node (the output is momentarily fed by the capacitor while the diode is reverse-biased), producing a non-minimum-phase zero on the right-half-plane and causing the output voltage to first move opposite to the commanded direction.\n\nE. Exact cancellation of the boost converter’s right-half-plane zero by placing a controller zero at the same location is feasible and will eliminate the inverse response without compromising stability or robustness.\n\nSelect all that apply.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed sound. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of power electronics and control theory, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively formulated. The provided parameters for both the buck and boost converters correspond to stable, continuous conduction mode operation under the given conditions, confirming the setup's physical realism.\n\nWe will now proceed with a first-principles derivation and analysis of the system behavior. The core of the problem is to compare the transient response of a buck and a boost converter under identical Proportional-Integral (PI) control, following a small positive step in the voltage reference. This requires analyzing the control-to-output transfer function, $G_{vd}(s) = \\hat{v}_o(s)/\\hat{d}(s)$, for each topology.\n\n### I. Fundamental Analysis of Converter Dynamics\n\nThe question asks for reasoning based on the fundamental laws: $v_{L} = L\\,di_{L}/dt$ and $i_{C} = C\\,dv_{o}/dt$. We will use the state-space averaging method to derive small-signal models.\n\n**1. Buck (Step-Down) Converter Analysis**\n\nIn a buck converter operating in Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM), the inductor is either connected to the input source $V_g$ (when the switch is on for interval $DT_s$) or to ground through the diode (when the switch is off for interval $(1-D)T_s$). The inductor current $i_L$ continuously flows to the output filter (capacitor and load).\n\nTo increase the output voltage $v_o$, the controller must increase the duty cycle $D$. Let's consider the effect of a small positive step in duty cycle, $\\hat{d}$.\n- An increased $D$ means the inductor is connected to the higher voltage $V_g$ for a longer duration.\n- The average voltage across the inductor is $\\langle v_L \\rangle = D(V_g - V_o) + (1-D)(-V_o) = D V_g - V_o$. In steady-state, $\\langle v_L \\rangle = 0$, so $V_o = D V_g$.\n- When $D$ is stepped up, the term $D V_g$ immediately increases, making $\\langle v_L \\rangle$ positive.\n- According to $di_L/dt = v_L/L$, a positive average voltage across the inductor causes the average inductor current $\\langle i_L \\rangle$ to rise.\n- This increased current flows directly to the output node. The current available to charge the capacitor is $i_C = i_L - v_o/R$. As $i_L$ increases, $i_C$ becomes more positive.\n- According to $dv_o/dt = i_C/C$, a positive capacitor current causes the output voltage $v_o$ to rise.\n\nThe response is direct: an increase in the control input ($D$) causes a monotonic increase in the output ($v_o$). There is no initial \"wrong-way\" or inverse response. This behavior is characteristic of a **minimum-phase system**. The small-signal control-to-output transfer function for the buck converter is:\n$$ G_{vd,\\mathrm{buck}}(s) = \\frac{\\hat{v}_o(s)}{\\hat{d}(s)} = \\frac{V_g(1+sC_{\\mathrm{buck}}r_{c,\\mathrm{buck}})}{s^2 L_{\\mathrm{buck}}C_{\\mathrm{buck}} + s(\\frac{L_{\\mathrm{buck}}}{R_{\\mathrm{buck}}}+C_{\\mathrm{buck}}r_{c,\\mathrm{buck}}) + 1} $$\nThis transfer function has two poles and one zero. The zero is located at $s = -1/(C_{\\mathrm{buck}}r_{c,\\mathrm{buck}})$. Since $C_{\\mathrm{buck}} > 0$ and $r_{c,\\mathrm{buck}} > 0$, this zero is in the Left-Half Plane (LHP). A system with all its poles and zeros in the LHP is minimum-phase. Its step response does not exhibit an initial undershoot.\n\n**2. Boost (Step-Up) Converter Analysis**\n\nIn a boost converter operating in CCM, the power delivery mechanism is indirect.\n- When the switch is ON (interval $DT_s$), the inductor is charged directly by the input source $V_g$. The output stage is isolated from the input and is supplied solely by the energy stored in the output capacitor $C$.\n- When the switch is OFF (interval $(1-D)T_s$), the inductor, now in series with $V_g$, delivers its stored energy to the output capacitor and load.\n\nLet's consider the effect of a small positive step in duty cycle, $\\hat{d}$. To achieve a higher steady-state output voltage ($V_o = V_g / (1-D)$), the controller increases $D$.\n- **Instantaneous Effect**: An increase in $D$ means the switch stays ON for a longer duration. During this extended ON-time, the diode remains reverse-biased, and no current flows from the input/inductor to the output. The load continues to draw current from the capacitor, causing the output voltage $v_o$ to drop further than it would have with the original duty cycle. This is an initial \"wrong-way\" response or undershoot.\n- **Averaged Effect**: Over a longer time scale, the increased duty cycle leads to a higher average inductor current $\\langle i_L \\rangle$. When the switch eventually turns off, this larger current charges the output capacitor to a new, higher voltage level.\n\nThis sequence—an initial dip in voltage followed by a rise to the final higher value—is the classic definition of an inverse response. This behavior is mathematically captured by a zero in the Right-Half Plane (RHP). A system with an RHP zero is called **non-minimum-phase**. The small-signal control-to-output transfer function for the boost converter (including ESR) is:\n$$ G_{vd,\\mathrm{boost}}(s) = \\frac{\\hat{v}_o(s)}{\\hat{d}(s)} = \\frac{V_g}{(1-D)^2} \\frac{(1 - s\\frac{L_{\\mathrm{boost}}}{R_{\\mathrm{boost}}(1-D)^2})(1+sC_{\\mathrm{boost}}r_{c,\\mathrm{boost}})}{\\text{denominator}(s)} $$\nThe denominator is a second-order polynomial similar to the buck case. The crucial part is the numerator, which has two zeros:\n1. A Left-Half-Plane (LHP) zero from the ESR: $s_{z,LHP} = -1/(C_{\\mathrm{boost}}r_{c,\\mathrm{boost}})$.\n2. A Right-Half-Plane (RHP) zero inherent to the topology: $s_{z,RHP} = + \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{boost}}(1-D)^2}{L_{\\mathrm{boost}}}$.\n\nWith the given parameters: $R_{\\mathrm{boost}} = 24\\,\\Omega$, $L_{\\mathrm{boost}} = 200\\,\\mu\\mathrm{H}$, and $D_{\\mathrm{boost}} = 0.5$.\n$$ s_{z,RHP} = \\frac{24\\,\\Omega \\times (1-0.5)^2}{200 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{H}} = \\frac{24 \\times 0.25}{200 \\times 10^{-6}} = \\frac{6}{200 \\times 10^{-6}} = 30000\\,\\mathrm{rad/s} $$\nThe existence of this positive real zero confirms the non-minimum-phase nature and predicts the inverse response.\n\n### II. Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. With the same PI controller, the buck converter exhibits a monotonic rise (no inverse response) to a small positive reference step, whereas the boost converter exhibits an initial dip (undershoot) before rising, because the boost plant is non-minimum-phase due to a right-half-plane zero in its control-to-output transfer function that reflects its energy-transfer mechanism.**\n\n- **Analysis**: This statement is perfectly aligned with our first-principles analysis. The buck converter is a minimum-phase system, and a well-tuned PI controller will result in a response that may have overshoot but will not have an initial undershoot (inverse response). The boost converter is a non-minimum-phase system due to the inherent RHP zero in its transfer function, which is a direct mathematical consequence of its two-stage energy transfer process. An RHP zero guarantees an inverse response to a step input.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. If the proportional and integral gains are identical, both buck and boost closed-loop step responses are identical because the controller dynamics dominate the plant and eliminate topology-specific effects.**\n\n- **Analysis**: This statement is incorrect. The closed-loop response of a system is given by $T(s) = \\frac{C(s)G(s)}{1+C(s)G(s)}$, where $C(s)$ is the controller and $G(s)$ is the plant. Even if $C(s)$ is identical in both cases, the plant transfer functions $G_{vd,\\mathrm{buck}}(s)$ and $G_{vd,\\mathrm{boost}}(s)$ are fundamentally different. Most notably, $G_{vd,\\mathrm{boost}}(s)$ contains an RHP zero. This RHP zero cannot be \"eliminated\" by the controller and will always be present as a zero of the closed-loop transfer function $T(s)$. The presence of this RHP zero in the boost system guarantees its step response will be fundamentally different from the buck system's response, irrespective of the controller gains.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The undershoot observed in the boost converter under a positive duty or reference step is caused solely by the capacitor equivalent series resistance; if $r_{c} \\to 0$, the inverse response disappears irrespective of duty cycle and load.**\n\n- **Analysis**: This statement incorrectly identifies the cause of the inverse response. As derived earlier, the RHP zero responsible for the undershoot is at $s_{z,RHP} = R(1-D)^2/L$. This term is independent of the capacitor's ESR, $r_c$. The ESR actually introduces a separate LHP zero at $s = -1/(Cr_c)$. If $r_c \\to 0$, this LHP zero moves to infinity, but the fundamental RHP zero, and therefore the inverse response, remains. The inverse response is an intrinsic characteristic of the boost topology's power flow, not a parasitic effect.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The inverse response in the boost converter is fundamentally due to the fact that increasing the duty cycle initially reduces instantaneous power delivery to the output node (the output is momentarily fed by the capacitor while the diode is reverse-biased), producing a non-minimum-phase zero on the right-half-plane and causing the output voltage to first move opposite to the commanded direction.**\n\n- **Analysis**: This statement provides an accurate and insightful physical explanation for the non-minimum-phase behavior of the boost converter. It correctly links the control action (increasing $D$), the physical mechanism (longer inductor charging time during which the output is isolated and supplied by the discharging capacitor), the mathematical model (an RHP zero), and the resulting observed behavior (initial undershoot). This is the correct first-principles reasoning for the inverse response.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**E. Exact cancellation of the boost converter’s right-half-plane zero by placing a controller zero at the same location is feasible and will eliminate the inverse response without compromising stability or robustness.**\n\n- **Analysis**: This statement is critically flawed from a control theory perspective. Attempting to cancel an RHP zero of a plant requires placing a pole in the controller at the same RHP location. For example, to cancel the plant zero at $s=s_z$ (where $s_z>0$), the controller would need a factor of $1/(s-s_z)$. This makes the controller itself unstable. While in a perfect mathematical world the unstable pole and zero would cancel in the overall transfer function, in any real system, minute parameter drifts or modeling inaccuracies would prevent perfect cancellation. The result is a closed-loop system containing an unstable pole, leading to internal instability. This practice is strictly forbidden in robust control system design.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a discrete-time difference equation for a Proportional-Integral (PI) controller from its continuous-time representation using the bilinear transformation. The goal is to determine the coefficients $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$ for the specified affine form of the difference equation.\n\nThe continuous-time transfer function of the PI controller is given as:\n$$\nC(s) = K_{p} + \\frac{K_{i}}{s}\n$$\nwhere $K_{p}$ is the proportional gain, $K_{i}$ is the integral gain, and $s$ is the Laplace variable. For algebraic manipulation, it is convenient to express this as a single rational function:\n$$\nC(s) = \\frac{K_{p}s + K_{i}}{s}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the use of the bilinear transformation, also known as the Tustin transformation, to convert the continuous-time transfer function $C(s)$ into a discrete-time transfer function $C(z)$. This transformation provides a mapping from the s-plane to the z-plane and is equivalent to approximating the continuous-time integration operator $1/s$ using the trapezoidal rule for numerical integration. The transformation is given by the substitution:\n$$\ns \\rightarrow \\frac{2}{T_{s}} \\frac{z-1}{z+1}\n$$\nwhere $T_s$ is the sampling period and $z$ is the discrete-time complex variable.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $s$ into the controller's transfer function $C(s)$ yields the discrete-time transfer function $C(z)$:\n$$\nC(z) = C(s) \\bigg|_{s = \\frac{2}{T_{s}} \\frac{z-1}{z+1}} = \\frac{K_{p} \\left( \\frac{2}{T_{s}} \\frac{z-1}{z+1} \\right) + K_{i}}{\\frac{2}{T_{s}} \\frac{z-1}{z+1}}\n$$\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the term $T_{s}(z+1)$:\n$$\nC(z) = \\frac{\\left[K_{p} \\left( \\frac{2}{T_{s}} \\frac{z-1}{z+1} \\right) + K_{i}\\right] T_{s}(z+1)}{\\left[ \\frac{2}{T_{s}} \\frac{z-1}{z+1} \\right] T_{s}(z+1)}\n$$\n$$\nC(z) = \\frac{K_{p} \\cdot 2(z-1) + K_{i} T_{s}(z+1)}{2(z-1)}\n$$\nExpanding the terms in the numerator:\n$$\nC(z) = \\frac{2K_{p}z - 2K_{p} + K_{i}T_{s}z + K_{i}T_{s}}{2z-2}\n$$\nGrouping terms by powers of $z$:\n$$\nC(z) = \\frac{(2K_{p} + K_{i}T_{s})z + (K_{i}T_{s} - 2K_{p})}{2z-2}\n$$\nThe discrete-time transfer function $C(z)$ relates the Z-transform of the control sequence, $U(z)$, to the Z-transform of the error sequence, $E(z)$, by the relation $C(z) = \\frac{U(z)}{E(z)}$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{U(z)}{E(z)} = \\frac{(2K_{p} + K_{i}T_{s})z + (K_{i}T_{s} - 2K_{p})}{2z-2}\n$$\nTo find the difference equation, we cross-multiply:\n$$\nU(z)(2z - 2) = E(z) \\left[ (2K_{p} + K_{i}T_{s})z + (K_{i}T_{s} - 2K_{p}) \\right]\n$$\nTo obtain a causal difference equation involving current and past values ($k$ and $k-1$), we divide the entire equation by the highest power of $z$, which is $z^1$:\n$$\nU(z)(2 - 2z^{-1}) = E(z) \\left[ (2K_{p} + K_{i}T_{s}) + (K_{i}T_{s} - 2K_{p})z^{-1} \\right]\n$$\nThis equation can be converted back to the time domain by applying the inverse Z-transform. The time-shift property of the Z-transform states that multiplication by $z^{-1}$ in the z-domain corresponds to a one-step time delay in the time domain. Thus, $z^{-1}X(z)$ corresponds to the sequence $x[k-1]$. Applying this yields the difference equation:\n$$\n2u[k] - 2u[k-1] = (2K_{p} + K_{i}T_{s})e[k] + (K_{i}T_{s} - 2K_{p})e[k-1]\n$$\nThe problem requires this equation to be in the affine form $u[k]=\\alpha\\,e[k]+\\beta\\,e[k-1]+\\gamma\\,u[k-1]$. We can achieve this by isolating the $u[k]$ term:\n$$\n2u[k] = (2K_{p} + K_{i}T_{s})e[k] + (K_{i}T_{s} - 2K_{p})e[k-1] + 2u[k-1]\n$$\nDividing the entire equation by $2$:\n$$\nu[k] = \\frac{2K_{p} + K_{i}T_{s}}{2} e[k] + \\frac{K_{i}T_{s} - 2K_{p}}{2} e[k-1] + \\frac{2}{2} u[k-1]\n$$\nSimplifying the coefficients gives:\n$$\nu[k] = \\left(K_{p} + \\frac{K_{i}T_{s}}{2}\\right) e[k] + \\left(\\frac{K_{i}T_{s}}{2} - K_{p}\\right) e[k-1] + (1) u[k-1]\n$$\nBy comparing this result with the target form $u[k]=\\alpha\\,e[k]+\\beta\\,e[k-1]+\\gamma\\,u[k-1]$, we can identify the coefficients $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$:\n$$\n\\alpha = K_{p} + \\frac{K_{i}T_{s}}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\beta = \\frac{K_{i}T_{s}}{2} - K_{p}\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma = 1\n$$\nThese are the closed-form expressions for the coefficients of the first-order difference equation that implements the PI controller using the bilinear transformation.",
