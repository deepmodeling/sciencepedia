            "problem": "A water-cooled valve arm in a High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) Modular Multilevel Converter uses Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) half-bridge submodules. For a single IGBT module, the one-dimensional thermal path from the silicon junction to the ambient air is represented by a Cauer-type thermal resistor-capacitor (RC) ladder. The thermal path includes a junction-to-case resistance and a case-to-cold-plate interface resistance. The cold-plate is aggressively water-cooled such that the cold-plate-to-ambient thermal resistance is negligible compared to the other elements, and the cold-plate temperature is effectively equal to ambient.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of heat transfer, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data for a unique solution, and expressed in objective, precise language.\n\nThe analysis begins with the thermal-electrical analogy, which provides an intuitive framework for understanding heat transfer phenomena. In this analogy, temperature, $T$, is analogous to electric potential (voltage), $V$. The heat flow rate, $\\dot{Q}$, is analogous to electric current, $I$. Thermal resistance, $R_{\\theta}$, is analogous to electrical resistance, $R$, and thermal capacitance, $C_{\\theta}$, is analogous to electrical capacitance, $C$.\n\nThe foundation of thermal resistance is Fourier's law of one-dimensional heat conduction:\n$$\n\\dot{Q} = -kA \\frac{dT}{dx}\n$$\nwhere $\\dot{Q}$ is the rate of heat transfer, $k$ is the thermal conductivity of the material, $A$ is the cross-sectional area perpendicular to the heat flow, and $\\frac{dT}{dx}$ is the temperature gradient. For a finite slab of material with thickness $L$ and constant cross-sectional area $A$, under steady-state conditions, this equation can be integrated to yield:\n$$\n\\dot{Q} = \\frac{kA}{L} (T_1 - T_2)\n$$\nwhere $T_1 - T_2 = \\Delta T$ is the temperature difference across the slab. Thermal resistance is defined as the ratio of the temperature difference to the heat flow rate:\n$$\nR_{\\theta} = \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\dot{Q}} = \\frac{L}{kA}\n$$\nThis relationship, $\\Delta T = \\dot{Q} R_{\\theta}$, is analogous to Ohm's Law, $\\Delta V = I R$.\n\nThe problem states that the thermal path is represented by a Cauer-type thermal resistor-capacitor (RC) ladder. This model is used for transient thermal analysis. In such a model, each node $i$ is associated with a thermal capacitance $C_{\\theta,i}$ and is connected to adjacent nodes by thermal resistances $R_{\\theta,i}$. The heat balance equation for a generic node $i$ in the ladder is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{T_{i-1}(t) - T_i(t)}{R_{\\theta, i-1, i}} - \\frac{T_i(t) - T_{i+1}(t)}{R_{\\theta, i, i+1}} = C_{\\theta, i} \\frac{dT_i(t)}{dt}\n$$\nThe term on the left represents the net heat flowing into node $i$, and the term on the right represents the rate of thermal energy stored at node $i$.\n\nThe problem asks for the *steady-state* junction temperature. By definition, steady-state implies that all system properties are constant with respect to time. Therefore, for all nodes $i$ in the thermal model, the temperature is constant, which means its time derivative is zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dT_i}{dt} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting this condition into the heat balance equation for each node yields:\n$$\n\\frac{T_{i-1} - T_i}{R_{\\theta, i-1, i}} - \\frac{T_i - T_{i+1}}{R_{\\theta, i, i+1}} = 0 \\implies \\frac{T_{i-1} - T_i}{R_{\\theta, i-1, i}} = \\frac{T_i - T_{i+1}}{R_{\\theta, i, i+1}}\n$$\nLetting $\\dot{Q}_{i-1,i}$ be the heat flow from node $i-1$ to $i$, we see that $\\dot{Q}_{i-1, i} = \\dot{Q}_{i, i+1}$. This demonstrates that in steady-state, the heat flow rate is constant through all the resistive elements in the series path. The thermal capacitors, which store energy only when temperature changes, have no effect on the steady-state temperature distribution. They are analogous to open circuits in a DC electrical analysis. Consequently, the complex RC ladder model simplifies to a circuit of purely series-connected thermal resistances.\n\nThe total temperature drop across a series of thermal resistances is the sum of the individual temperature drops. If a constant heat flow $\\dot{Q}$ passes through the series chain, the total temperature drop $\\Delta T_{\\text{total}}$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_i \\Delta T_i = \\sum_i (\\dot{Q} R_{\\theta,i}) = \\dot{Q} \\left( \\sum_i R_{\\theta,i} \\right) = \\dot{Q} R_{\\theta,\\text{total}}\n$$\nThis justifies why the steady-state behavior of the thermal RC ladder reduces to a series sum of thermal resistances.\n\nNext, we must establish why the steady-state heat flow rate, $\\dot{Q}$, equals the dissipated power, $P$. The First Law of Thermodynamics for the semiconductor junction (the control volume where heat is generated) states that the rate of change of internal energy, $\\frac{dE}{dt}$, equals the rate of energy generation, $\\dot{E}_{\\text{gen}}$, minus the net rate of energy leaving the control volume, $\\dot{E}_{\\text{out}}$. Here, $\\dot{E}_{\\text{gen}}$ is the power dissipated as heat in the junction, $P$. The energy leaving is the heat flow rate $\\dot{Q}$. The rate of change of internal energy is related to the junction's thermal capacitance $C_{\\theta,j}$ and temperature $T_j$ by $\\frac{dE}{dt} = C_{\\theta,j} \\frac{dT_j}{dt}$.\nThus, the energy balance is:\n$$\nC_{\\theta,j} \\frac{dT_j}{dt} = P - \\dot{Q}\n$$\nIn steady-state, $\\frac{dT_j}{dt}=0$, which leads to $P = \\dot{Q}$. The entire power dissipated in the junction must be transported away as heat.\n\nNow, we can compute the junction temperature, $T_j$. The thermal path consists of the junction-to-case resistance, $R_{\\theta jc}$, and the case-to-sink resistance, $R_{\\theta cs}$, connected in series. The sink is the cold-plate, which is at the ambient temperature $T_{\\text{amb}}$ since its own thermal resistance is negligible.\nThe total thermal resistance from the junction to the ambient is:\n$$\nR_{\\theta ja} = R_{\\theta jc} + R_{\\theta cs}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nR_{\\theta ja} = 0.05\\,\\text{K/W} + 0.10\\,\\text{K/W} = 0.15\\,\\text{K/W}\n$$\nThe temperature difference between the junction and the ambient environment is given by:\n$$\nT_j - T_{\\text{amb}} = \\dot{Q} \\cdot R_{\\theta ja}\n$$\nAs established, in steady-state, $\\dot{Q} = P$. The dissipated power is given as $P=1\\,\\text{kW} = 1000\\,\\text{W}$.\n$$\nT_j - T_{\\text{amb}} = P \\cdot R_{\\theta ja}\n$$\nThe junction temperature $T_j$ can be calculated by rearranging the equation:\n$$\nT_j = T_{\\text{amb}} + P \\cdot R_{\\theta ja}\n$$\nWe are given $T_{\\text{amb}} = 40^\\circ\\text{C}$. Note that a temperature difference of $1\\,\\text{K}$ is equal to a temperature difference of $1^\\circ\\text{C}$, so the units of thermal resistance $\\text{K/W}$ are numerically equivalent to $^\\circ\\text{C/W}$ when calculating temperature differences.\n$$\nT_j = 40^\\circ\\text{C} + (1000\\,\\text{W}) \\cdot (0.15\\,^\\circ\\text{C}/\\text{W})\n$$\n$$\nT_j = 40^\\circ\\text{C} + 150^\\circ\\text{C}\n$$\n$$\nT_j = 190^\\circ\\text{C}\n$$\nThe steady-state junction temperature of the IGBT module is $190^\\circ\\text{C}$.",

This means the magnitude of the actual voltage deviation must satisfy $|\\Delta V_{\\text{dev}}| \\le \\Delta V$.

The magnitude of the power mismatch is $|\\Delta P| = \\Delta P$.\n$$\\Delta P = C V_{\\text{dc}} \\frac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta t}$$\nWe can now solve for the minimum capacitance, $C_{\\text{min}}$, which we will denote as $C$:\n$$C = \\frac{\\Delta P \\cdot \\Delta t}{V_{\\text{dc}} \\cdot \\Delta V}$$\nThe problem provides the maximum ripple as a fraction of the nominal voltage, $\\Delta V = 0.02 V_{\\text{dc}}$.

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nLet $x$ be the distance of the fault from the measuring terminal. Let $v$ be the propagation speed of the traveling wave. The fault is assumed to occur at time $t=0$.\n\nThe first wave generated by the fault travels a distance $x$ to reach the measuring terminal. The time of this first arrival, $t_1$, is given by the fundamental relation between distance, speed, and time:\n$$t_1 = \\frac{x}{v}$$\n\nUpon reaching the measuring terminal, the wave is partially reflected due to an impedance mismatch. This reflected wave travels back along the cable towards the fault point. The distance traveled is $x$. At the fault location, the wave encounters another impedance discontinuity (the fault itself), causing it to reflect again. This re-reflected wave then travels back towards the measuring terminal, covering the distance $x$ once more.\n\nThe total path length traveled by the wave between the first arrival event and the second arrival event is the round trip from the terminal to the fault and back again. This distance is $x + x = 2x$.\n\nThe time duration for this round trip, $\\Delta t$, is:\n$$\\Delta t = \\frac{2x}{v}$$\nThis time $\\Delta t$ is the measured time difference between the first arrival and the second arrival at the terminal. That is, if the second arrival occurs at time $t_2$, then $\\Delta t = t_2 - t_1$.\n\nThe problem requires an estimator for the fault distance $x$ as a function of this measured time difference $\\Delta t$. We can rearrange the equation above to solve for $x$:\n$$x = \\frac{v \\cdot \\Delta t}{2}$$\nThis is the single-ended estimator for the fault distance.\n\nNext, we must determine the location accuracy limited by the sampling quantization. The measurement system samples the incoming signal at a frequency $f_s$. The time resolution of the measurement system is limited by its sampling period, $T_s$, where:\n$$T_s = \\frac{1}{f_s}$$\nAny measured time interval, such as $\\Delta t$, is quantized in integer multiples of $T_s$. The smallest possible change in the measured time difference, $\\delta(\\Delta t)$, is therefore one sampling period:\n$$\\delta(\\Delta t) = T_s = \\frac{1}{f_s}$$\nThe location accuracy, $\\Delta x_{acc}$, is defined as the minimum change in the estimated location, $\\delta x$, that results from this minimum change in the measured time difference. Using the estimator for $x$, we can find the relationship between a small change in $x$ and a small change in $\\Delta t$:\n$$\\delta x = \\frac{v}{2} \\delta(\\Delta t)$$\nSubstituting $\\delta(\\Delta t) = T_s$, we find the location accuracy:\n$$\\Delta x_{acc} = \\frac{v \\cdot T_s}{2} = \\frac{v}{2 f_s}$$\nNow we can substitute the given numerical values to compute the accuracy.\nThe given values are:\n- $v = 160\\,\\text{m/\\mu s} = 160 \\times \\frac{1\\,\\text{m}}{10^{-6}\\,\\text{s}} = 1.6 \\times 10^8\\,\\text{m/s}$\n- $f_s = 100\\,\\text{kHz} = 100 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{Hz} = 1 \\times 10^5\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\Delta x_{acc}$:\n$$\\Delta x_{acc} = \\frac{1.6 \\times 10^8\\,\\text{m/s}}{2 \\times (1 \\times 10^5\\,\\text{s}^{-1})} = \\frac{1.6}{2} \\times 10^{8-5}\\,\\text{m} = 0.8 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{m} = 800\\,\\text{m}$$\nThe problem asks for the final answer to be expressed in kilometers and rounded to $3$ significant figures.\n$$800\\,\\text{m} = 0.800\\,\\text{km}$$\n\nThe location accuracy limited by sampling quantization is $0.800\\,\\text{km}$.",
