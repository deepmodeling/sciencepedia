            "problem": "A Solid-State Transformer (SST) stage employs a Medium-Frequency Transformer (MFT) with a primary winding of $N$ turns on a magnetic core of uniform cross-sectional area $A_{c}$. The primary is driven by an ideal full-bridge inverter that applies a symmetric square-wave voltage of amplitude $V$ at fundamental frequency $f$ across the primary. Assume a high-permeability core with negligible leakage, uniform flux distribution across $A_{c}$, negligible magnetizing current waveform distortion, and no direct-current bias in the core; core loss and parasitic effects are neglected for the purpose of this derivation.\n\nStarting only from Maxwell–Faraday law and the definition of magnetic flux density, derive a relationship linking $A_{c}$, $N$, the peak flux density $B_{\\mathrm{pk}}$, and the half-cycle volt–second product $\\mathcal{W} \\equiv \\int_{0}^{T/2} v(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t$, where $T = 1/f$.

Your answer must be a single algebraic expression.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an expression for the peak magnetic flux density, $B_{\\mathrm{pk}}$, in the core of a Medium-Frequency Transformer (MFT) driven by a symmetric square-wave voltage. The derivation must start from fundamental principles as specified.\n\nThe relationship between the voltage applied across a winding and the magnetic flux it generates is described by the Maxwell–Faraday law of induction. For a winding of $N$ turns, the induced electromotive force (emf), $e(t)$, is equal to the rate of change of the total magnetic flux, $\\Phi_B(t)$, linking the turns. The standard formulation is $e(t) = -N \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\Phi_B(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}$. The applied voltage, $v(t)$, must overcome this back-emf to drive the flux change. Neglecting resistive and other parasitic voltage drops, as stipulated by the problem's idealizations, we have $v(t) = -e(t)$. Therefore, the governing equation for the transformer primary is:\n$$v(t) = N \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\Phi_B(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}$$\nThe magnetic flux $\\Phi_B(t)$ is defined as the integral of the magnetic flux density, $B(t)$, over the core's cross-sectional area, $A_c$. The problem states that the flux distribution is uniform, which simplifies this relationship to a direct product:\n$$\\Phi_B(t) = B(t) A_c$$\nSubstituting this definition of flux into the voltage equation yields:\n$$v(t) = N \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t} [B(t) A_c]$$\nSince the cross-sectional area $A_c$ is constant, it can be moved outside the derivative:\n$$v(t) = N A_c \\frac{\\mathrm{d}B(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}$$\nTo relate this to the half-cycle volt-second product, $\\mathcal{W}$, we integrate both sides of the equation over the first half of the period, from $t=0$ to $t=T/2$, where $T$ is the period of the waveform.\n$$\\int_{0}^{T/2} v(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t = \\int_{0}^{T/2} N A_c \\frac{\\mathrm{d}B(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\mathrm{d}t$$\nThe left side of the equation is the definition of $\\mathcal{W}$. The right side can be simplified as $N$ and $A_c$ are constants:\n$$\\mathcal{W} = N A_c \\int_{0}^{T/2} \\mathrm{d}B(t)$$\nEvaluating the integral on the right side gives the total change in magnetic flux density over the interval $[0, T/2]$:\n$$\\mathcal{W} = N A_c [B(T/2) - B(0)]$$\nFor a symmetric AC excitation with no DC bias, the magnetic flux density $B(t)$ must oscillate symmetrically about zero. This means that over one half-cycle, the flux density will swing from its negative peak value, $-B_{\\mathrm{pk}}$, to its positive peak value, $+B_{\\mathrm{pk}}$ (or vice-versa). Let us set $B(0) = -B_{\\mathrm{pk}}$ and consequently $B(T/2) = +B_{\\mathrm{pk}}$. The total change in flux density, or the flux swing, over this half-cycle is:\n$$B(T/2) - B(0) = B_{\\mathrm{pk}} - (-B_{\\mathrm{pk}}) = 2 B_{\\mathrm{pk}}$$\nSubstituting this result into the equation for $\\mathcal{W}$ provides the first required relationship:\n$$\\mathcal{W} = N A_c (2 B_{\\mathrm{pk}})$$\nThis is often referred to as the transformer's volt-second capability.\n\nNext, we must determine the specific value of $\\mathcal{W}$ for the given excitation waveform. The primary is driven by a symmetric square-wave voltage of amplitude $V$. Over the first half-cycle, from $t=0$ to $t=T/2$, the voltage is constant at $v(t) = V$. We can now compute the integral for $\\mathcal{W}$:\n$$\\mathcal{W} = \\int_{0}^{T/2} v(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t = \\int_{0}^{T/2} V\\,\\mathrm{d}t$$\nSince $V$ is a constant amplitude:\n$$\\mathcal{W} = V [t]_{0}^{T/2} = V \\left(\\frac{T}{2} - 0\\right) = \\frac{VT}{2}$$\nThe problem gives the relationship between period $T$ and frequency $f$ as $T = 1/f$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\mathcal{W}$:\n$$\\mathcal{W} = \\frac{V}{2f}$$\nNow we have two expressions for the half-cycle volt-second product $\\mathcal{W}$. The final step is to equate these two expressions to eliminate $\\mathcal{W}$ and solve for the peak flux density $B_{\\mathrm{pk}}$.\n$$N A_c (2 B_{\\mathrm{pk}}) = \\frac{V}{2f}$$\nRearranging the equation to solve for $B_{\\mathrm{pk}}$:\n$$B_{\\mathrm{pk}} = \\frac{V}{2f \\cdot 2 N A_c}$$\nThis simplifies to the final closed-form expression:\n$$B_{\\mathrm{pk}} = \\frac{V}{4 f N A_c}$$\nThis formula provides the peak magnetic flux density in the transformer core as a function of the applied square-wave voltage amplitude, frequency, number of primary turns, and core cross-sectional area.",

The transformer has turns ratio $n = N_{p}/N_{s}$, such that the secondary DC voltage referred to the primary side is $V_{s}' = n V_{s}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It describes a standard design calculation for a Dual Active Bridge (DAB) DC-DC converter, a fundamental component in solid-state transformer architectures. The provided data are physically realistic and sufficient for a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem asks for the required leakage inductance $L$ of a DAB converter operating under specific conditions. We begin by deriving the fundamental equations for power transfer and peak inductor current from first principles.\n\nFirst, we verify the operating condition. The primary DC link voltage is $V_{p} = 800\\,\\mathrm{V}$. The secondary DC link voltage is $V_{s} = 3200\\,\\mathrm{V}$ with a transformer turns ratio $n = N_{p}/N_{s} = 0.25$. The secondary voltage referred to the primary side is $V_{s}' = n V_{s} = 0.25 \\times 3200\\,\\mathrm{V} = 800\\,\\mathrm{V}$. Thus, we have the matched voltage condition, $V_{p} = V_{s}'$. Let us denote this matched voltage as $V = V_{p} = V_{s}' = 800\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nThe DAB operates by generating two square-wave voltages, $v_p(t)$ and $v_s'(t)$, with amplitudes $V$ and a relative phase shift $\\delta$. Power flows from the leading voltage to the lagging voltage. We assume $v_p(t)$ leads $v_s'(t)$ by $\\delta$. The voltage across the leakage inductor $L$ is given by Kirchhoff's Voltage Law: $v_L(t) = v_p(t) - v_s'(t)$.\n\nWe analyze the system over one half of a switching period, $T = 1/f$. Let the interval be $t \\in [0, T/2]$, which corresponds to an angular interval of $\\theta = \\omega t \\in [0, \\pi]$, where $\\omega = 2\\pi f$. In this interval, the primary bridge output is constant, $v_p(t) = V$. The secondary bridge voltage $v_s'(t)$ is phase-shifted by $\\delta$, meaning it switches from $-V$ to $+V$ at $\\theta = \\delta$.\nThe waveforms over the interval $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$ are:\n- $v_p(\\theta) = V$\n- $v_s'(\\theta) = -V$ for $0 \\le \\theta < \\delta$\n- $v_s'(\\theta) = +V$ for $\\delta \\le \\theta \\le \\pi$\n\nThe inductor voltage $v_L(\\theta)$ is therefore:\n- For $0 \\le \\theta < \\delta$: $v_L(\\theta) = v_p(\\theta) - v_s'(\\theta) = V - (-V) = 2V$.\n- For $\\delta \\le \\theta \\le \\pi$: $v_L(\\theta) = v_p(\\theta) - v_s'(\\theta) = V - V = 0$.\n\nThe inductor current $i_L(t)$ is related to the voltage by $v_L(t) = L \\frac{\\mathrm{d}i_L}{\\mathrm{d}t}$. In terms of angle $\\theta = \\omega t$, this is $v_L(\\theta) = \\omega L \\frac{\\mathrm{d}i_L}{\\mathrm{d}\\theta}$. The change in inductor current is found by integrating the voltage:\n$\\Delta i_L = \\frac{1}{\\omega L} \\int v_L(\\theta) \\mathrm{d}\\theta$.\n\nThe inductor current waveform is piecewise linear. Due to steady-state waveform symmetry, the current must be anti-periodic, i.e., $i_L(\\pi) = -i_L(0)$. We can use this to find the initial current $i_L(0)$.\nThe current at angle $\\theta$ is $i_L(\\theta) = i_L(0) + \\frac{1}{\\omega L} \\int_0^\\theta v_L(\\alpha) \\mathrm{d}\\alpha$.\nThe current at $\\theta = \\pi$ is:\n$i_L(\\pi) = i_L(0) + \\frac{1}{\\omega L} \\left( \\int_0^\\delta 2V \\, \\mathrm{d}\\alpha + \\int_\\delta^\\pi 0 \\, \\mathrm{d}\\alpha \\right) = i_L(0) + \\frac{2V\\delta}{\\omega L}$.\nUsing the anti-periodicity condition $i_L(\\pi) = -i_L(0)$:\n$-i_L(0) = i_L(0) + \\frac{2V\\delta}{\\omega L} \\implies -2i_L(0) = \\frac{2V\\delta}{\\omega L} \\implies i_L(0) = -\\frac{V\\delta}{\\omega L}$.\n\nNow we can define the inductor current over the half-period:\n- For $0 \\le \\theta < \\delta$: $i_L(\\theta) = i_L(0) + \\frac{1}{\\omega L} \\int_0^\\theta 2V \\mathrm{d}\\alpha = -\\frac{V\\delta}{\\omega L} + \\frac{2V\\theta}{\\omega L} = \\frac{V}{\\omega L}(2\\theta - \\delta)$.\n- For $\\delta \\le \\theta \\le \\pi$: $i_L(\\theta)$ is constant since $v_L=0$. The value is $i_L(\\delta) = \\frac{V}{\\omega L}(2\\delta - \\delta) = \\frac{V\\delta}{\\omega L}$.\n\nThe peak value of the inductor current, $I_{\\mathrm{pk}}$, occurs at the boundaries of the linear ramp. The absolute value of the current at $\\theta=0$ is $|i_L(0)| = \\frac{V\\delta}{\\omega L}$, and the current from $\\theta=\\delta$ to $\\theta=\\pi$ is $i_L(\\theta) = \\frac{V\\delta}{\\omega L}$. Thus, the peak inductor current amplitude is:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{pk}} = \\frac{V \\delta}{\\omega L}$$\n\nNext, we derive the average power transferred, $P$. The instantaneous power from the primary source is $p(t) = v_p(t) i_L(t)$. The average power is the average of $p(t)$ over one period $T$. Due to symmetry, we can average over a half-period:\n$P = \\frac{1}{T/2} \\int_0^{T/2} v_p(t) i_L(t) \\mathrm{d}t$.\nSince $v_p(t) = V$ for $t \\in [0, T/2]$, and converting to an integral over $\\theta$:\n$P = \\frac{\\omega}{\\pi} \\int_0^{\\pi/\\omega} V i_L(\\omega t) \\mathrm{d}t = \\frac{V}{\\pi} \\int_0^\\pi i_L(\\theta) \\mathrm{d}\\theta$.\nWe evaluate the integral:\n$\\int_0^\\pi i_L(\\theta) \\mathrm{d}\\theta = \\int_0^\\delta \\frac{V}{\\omega L}(2\\theta - \\delta) \\mathrm{d}\\theta + \\int_\\delta^\\pi \\frac{V\\delta}{\\omega L} \\mathrm{d}\\theta$\n$= \\frac{V}{\\omega L} \\left[ \\theta^2 - \\delta\\theta \\right]_0^\\delta + \\frac{V\\delta}{\\omega L} [\\theta]_\\delta^\\pi$\n$= \\frac{V}{\\omega L} (\\delta^2 - \\delta^2) + \\frac{V\\delta}{\\omega L}(\\pi - \\delta)$\n$= \\frac{V\\delta(\\pi - \\delta)}{\\omega L}$.\n\nSubstituting this back into the power equation:\n$P = \\frac{V}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{V\\delta(\\pi - \\delta)}{\\omega L} \\right) = \\frac{V^2 \\delta(\\pi - \\delta)}{\\pi \\omega L}$.\nThis is the symbolic expression for the transferred power.\n$$P = \\frac{V^2 \\delta(\\pi - \\delta)}{\\pi \\omega L}$$\n\nThe problem requires determining $L$ such that at the maximum phase shift $\\delta_{\\max} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, the converter delivers its rated power $P_{\\mathrm{rated}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{kW}$. We substitute these values into the power equation:\n$P_{\\mathrm{rated}} = \\frac{V^2 (\\pi/2)(\\pi - \\pi/2)}{\\pi \\omega L} = \\frac{V^2 (\\pi/2)^2}{\\pi \\omega L} = \\frac{V^2 \\pi^2 / 4}{\\pi \\omega L} = \\frac{V^2 \\pi}{4 \\omega L}$.\n\nWe solve for the inductance $L$:\n$L = \\frac{V^2 \\pi}{4 \\omega P_{\\mathrm{rated}}}$.\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values:\n- $V = 800\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n- $f = 50\\,\\mathrm{kHz} = 50 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$\n- $\\omega = 2\\pi f = 2\\pi (50 \\times 10^3) = 10^5 \\pi\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$\n- $P_{\\mathrm{rated}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{kW} = 20 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{W}$\n\n$L = \\frac{(800)^2 \\pi}{4 (10^5 \\pi) (20 \\times 10^3)} = \\frac{640000 \\pi}{80 \\times 10^3 \\times 10^5 \\pi} = \\frac{64 \\times 10^4}{80 \\times 10^8} = \\frac{64}{80} \\times 10^{-4} = 0.8 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{H}$.\n$L = 8 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{H} = 80 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{H} = 80\\,\\mathrm{\\mu H}$.\n\nFinally, we must verify that this value of $L$ does not lead to a peak current exceeding the specified limit $I_{\\mathrm{pk,lim}} = 50\\,\\mathrm{A}$ when operating at rated power (i.e., at $\\delta = \\delta_{\\max} = \\pi/2$).\nUsing the peak current formula:\n$I_{\\mathrm{pk}} = \\frac{V \\delta_{\\max}}{\\omega L} = \\frac{800 \\cdot (\\pi/2)}{(10^5 \\pi) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-5})}$.\n$I_{\\mathrm{pk}} = \\frac{400 \\pi}{10^5 \\pi \\cdot 8 \\cdot 10^{-5}} = \\frac{400 \\pi}{8\\pi} = \\frac{400}{8} = 50\\,\\mathrm{A}$.\n\nThe calculated peak current is $50\\,\\mathrm{A}$, which is equal to the limit $I_{\\mathrm{pk,lim}} = 50\\,\\mathrm{A}$. The condition \"without exceeding the peak current limit\" is satisfied, as the peak current is exactly at the limit.\n\nThe required inductance value is $80\\,\\mathrm{\\mu H}$.

The phase of the loop transfer function at the crossover frequency is:\n$$\\arg(L(j\\omega_c)) = \\arg\\left(\\frac{K_{p}}{j\\omega_c L_{total}} \\exp(-j\\omega_c T_{d})\\right)$$\nSince $K_p$, $\\omega_c$, and $L_{total}$ are positive real constants, the phase is determined by the term $1/j$ and the delay term:\n$$\\arg(L(j\\omega_c)) = \\arg\\left(\\frac{1}{j}\\right) + \\arg\\left(\\exp(-j\\omega_c T_{d})\\right) = -90^\\circ - \\omega_c T_d \\left(\\frac{180^\\circ}{\\pi}\\right)$$\nWe calculate the phase lag from the delay, $\\omega_c T_d$:\n$$\\omega_c T_d = (4000\\pi \\,\\mathrm{rad/s}) \\times (75 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\mathrm{s}) = 0.3\\pi \\,\\mathrm{rad}$$\nConverting this phase lag to degrees:\n$$\\Delta\\phi = 0.3\\pi \\,\\mathrm{rad} \\times \\frac{180^\\circ}{\\pi \\,\\mathrm{rad}} = 54^\\circ$$\nThe total phase of the loop at $\\omega_c$ is:\n$$\\arg(L(j\\omega_c)) = -90^\\circ - 54^\\circ = -144^\\circ$$\nThe phase margin is therefore:\n$$PM = 180^\\circ + (-144^\\circ) = 36^\\circ$$\nRounding to three significant figures, $PM = 36.0^\\circ$.\n\nThe requested values are the bandwidth in hertz and the phase margin in degrees.\nBandwidth: $2.00 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$\nPhase Margin: $36.0^\\circ$",
