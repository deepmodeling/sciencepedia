            "problem": "A two-coil near-field inductive Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) link operates at a fixed angular frequency $\\omega$ in sinusoidal steady-state. The primary coil has inductance $L_1$ and is driven by a Thevenin source with open-circuit phasor voltage $V_s$ and internal series resistance $R_s$. A series capacitor $C_1$ is inserted with the primary coil such that the net primary reactance is tuned out at $\\omega$, that is, $\\omega^2 L_1 C_1 = 1$. The secondary coil has inductance $L_2$, is magnetically coupled to the primary with mutual inductance $M$, and directly feeds a purely resistive load $R_L$ (no compensation on the secondary). All coils are ideal and lossless, and radiation is negligible. The coupling is weak to moderate, and the magnetically coupled system is linear.\n\nStarting from Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL) in the phasor domain for the two coupled inductors, and using the definition of mutual inductance and linear circuit theory, derive an expression for the real input resistance seen by the source due solely to the secondary-load branch. Then, using the sinusoidal steady-state power expression for a Thevenin source feeding a load with real input resistance, show that the real power delivered by the source to the coupled network is maximized when the real part of the reflected impedance equals $R_s$. Finally, for given $M$, $L_2$, and $\\omega$, derive the closed-form expression(s) for the load resistance $R_L$ that achieve this matching condition. Assume matching is achievable at the given $\\omega$ and coupling $M$. Express your final answer(s) for $R_L$ in ohms. No numerical evaluation is required, and no rounding is needed; provide exact symbolic expressions.",
            "solution": "Let all voltages and currents be represented by their phasors. The KVL equations for the primary and secondary loops are written in the phasor domain.\n\nPrimary loop:\n$$V_s = I_1 \\left(R_s + j\\omega L_1 + \\frac{1}{j\\omega C_1}\\right) - j\\omega M I_2$$\nSecondary loop:\n$$0 = I_2 (R_L + j\\omega L_2) - j\\omega M I_1$$\n\nThe problem states that the primary circuit is tuned to resonance, such that $\\omega^2 L_1 C_1 = 1$. This implies $\\omega L_1 = \\frac{1}{\\omega C_1}$, so the reactive part of the primary self-impedance is zero. The primary KVL equation simplifies to:\n$$V_s = I_1 R_s - j\\omega M I_2$$\n\nFrom the secondary loop KVL, we solve for the secondary current $I_2$ in terms of the primary current $I_1$:\n$$I_2 = \\frac{j\\omega M}{R_L + j\\omega L_2} I_1$$\n\nWe substitute this expression for $I_2$ back into the simplified primary KVL equation:\n$$V_s = I_1 R_s - j\\omega M \\left(\\frac{j\\omega M}{R_L + j\\omega L_2} I_1\\right)$$\n$$V_s = I_1 \\left(R_s + \\frac{(\\omega M)^2}{R_L + j\\omega L_2}\\right)$$\n\nThe total impedance seen by the voltage source $V_s$ is $Z_{total} = R_s + Z_{in}$, where $Z_{in}$ is the impedance of the coupled network as seen from the terminals of the source resistance $R_s$:\n$$Z_{in} = \\frac{(\\omega M)^2}{R_L + j\\omega L_2}$$\nThis impedance is what is \"reflected\" from the secondary circuit to the primary. To find the real input resistance due to the secondary branch, we find the real part of $Z_{in}$, denoted $R_{ref}$:\n$$Z_{in} = \\frac{(\\omega M)^2}{R_L + j\\omega L_2} \\cdot \\frac{R_L - j\\omega L_2}{R_L - j\\omega L_2} = \\frac{(\\omega M)^2(R_L - j\\omega L_2)}{R_L^2 + (\\omega L_2)^2}$$\n$$R_{ref} = \\text{Re}(Z_{in}) = \\frac{(\\omega M)^2 R_L}{R_L^2 + (\\omega L_2)^2}$$\n\nAccording to the maximum power transfer theorem, a Thevenin source with resistance $R_s$ delivers maximum power to a load when the load resistance equals the source resistance. In this problem, the \"load\" seen by the source resistance $R_s$ is the coupled network. The problem simplifies the matching condition to only consider the real part of the reflected impedance. Thus, power transfer is maximized when:\n$$R_{ref} = R_s$$\n\nFinally, we derive the expression(s) for the load resistance $R_L$ that satisfy this matching condition:\n$$R_s = \\frac{(\\omega M)^2 R_L}{R_L^2 + (\\omega L_2)^2}$$\nRearranging this to solve for $R_L$:\n$$R_s (R_L^2 + (\\omega L_2)^2) = (\\omega M)^2 R_L$$\n$$R_s R_L^2 - (\\omega M)^2 R_L + R_s (\\omega L_2)^2 = 0$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $R_L$.

The two values of $R_L$ that achieve the matching condition are therefore:\n$$R_L = \\frac{\\omega^2 M^2 \\pm \\sqrt{\\omega^4 M^4 - 4 R_s^2 \\omega^2 L_2^2}}{2R_s}$$\nThese are the final closed-form expressions for the load resistance.",
