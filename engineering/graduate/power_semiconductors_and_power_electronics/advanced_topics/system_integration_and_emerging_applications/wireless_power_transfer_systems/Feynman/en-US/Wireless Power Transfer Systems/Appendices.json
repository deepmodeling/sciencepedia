            "problem": "A two-coil near-field inductive Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) link operates at a fixed angular frequency $\\omega$ in sinusoidal steady-state. The primary coil has inductance $L_1$ and is driven by a Thevenin source with open-circuit phasor voltage $V_s$ and internal series resistance $R_s$. A series capacitor $C_1$ is inserted with the primary coil such that the net primary reactance is tuned out at $\\omega$, that is, $\\omega^2 L_1 C_1 = 1$. The secondary coil has inductance $L_2$, is magnetically coupled to the primary with mutual inductance $M$, and directly feeds a purely resistive load $R_L$ (no compensation on the secondary). All coils are ideal and lossless, and radiation is negligible. The coupling is weak to moderate, and the magnetically coupled system is linear.\n\nStarting from Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL) in the phasor domain for the two coupled inductors, and using the definition of mutual inductance and linear circuit theory, derive an expression for the real input resistance seen by the source due solely to the secondary-load branch.

Verdict:**\nThe problem is valid. It is a standard, solvable problem in the analysis of WPT systems.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Solution\n\nLet all voltages and currents be represented by their phasors. The KVL equations for the primary and secondary loops are written in the phasor domain.\n\nThe impedance of the primary coil is $j\\omega L_1$. The impedance of the series capacitor is $\\frac{1}{j\\omega C_1} = -j\\frac{1}{\\omega C_1}$. The total self-impedance of the primary RLC network is $Z_{p,self} = R_s + j\\omega L_1 + \\frac{1}{j\\omega C_1}$.\nThe impedance of the secondary circuit is $Z_{s,self} = R_L + j\\omega L_2$.\n\nThe KVL equations for the two-coil system are:\nPrimary loop:\n$$V_s = I_1 \\left(R_s + j\\omega L_1 + \\frac{1}{j\\omega C_1}\\right) - j\\omega M I_2$$\nSecondary loop:\n$$0 = I_2 (R_L + j\\omega L_2) - j\\omega M I_1$$\n\nThe problem states that the primary circuit is tuned to resonance, such that $\\omega^2 L_1 C_1 = 1$. This implies $\\omega L_1 = \\frac{1}{\\omega C_1}$. The reactive part of the primary self-impedance is therefore zero:\n$$j\\omega L_1 + \\frac{1}{j\\omega C_1} = j\\omega L_1 - j\\frac{1}{\\omega C_1} = 0$$\nThe primary KVL equation simplifies to:\n$$V_s = I_1 R_s - j\\omega M I_2$$\n\nFrom the secondary loop KVL, we solve for the secondary current $I_2$ in terms of the primary current $I_1$:\n$$I_2 = \\frac{j\\omega M}{R_L + j\\omega L_2} I_1$$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $I_2$ back into the simplified primary KVL equation:\n$$V_s = I_1 R_s - j\\omega M \\left(\\frac{j\\omega M}{R_L + j\\omega L_2} I_1\\right)$$\n$$V_s = I_1 R_s + \\frac{(\\omega M)^2}{R_L + j\\omega L_2} I_1$$\n$$V_s = I_1 \\left(R_s + \\frac{(\\omega M)^2}{R_L + j\\omega L_2}\\right)$$\n\nThe total impedance seen by the voltage source $V_s$ is $Z_{total} = \\frac{V_s}{I_1}$:\n$$Z_{total} = R_s + \\frac{(\\omega M)^2}{R_L + j\\omega L_2}$$\nThe impedance of the coupled network, as seen from the terminals of the source resistance $R_s$, is the reflected impedance $Z_{in}$ (also denoted as $Z_{ref}$), which is the second term:\n$$Z_{in} = \\frac{(\\omega M)^2}{R_L + j\\omega L_2}$$\nThis impedance is what is \"reflected\" from the secondary circuit to the primary circuit due to the mutual coupling. The problem asks for the \"real input resistance seen by the source due solely to the secondary-load branch,\" which is the real part of this reflected impedance, $\\text{Re}(Z_{in})$.\n\nTo find the real part, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:\n$$Z_{in} = \\frac{(\\omega M)^2}{R_L + j\\omega L_2} \\cdot \\frac{R_L - j\\omega L_2}{R_L - j\\omega L_2} = \\frac{(\\omega M)^2(R_L - j\\omega L_2)}{R_L^2 + (\\omega L_2)^2}$$\n$$Z_{in} = \\frac{(\\omega M)^2 R_L}{R_L^2 + (\\omega L_2)^2} - j \\frac{(\\omega M)^2 \\omega L_2}{R_L^2 + (\\omega L_2)^2}$$\nThe real part of the reflected impedance, which we denote as $R_{ref}$, is:\n$$R_{ref} = \\text{Re}(Z_{in}) = \\frac{(\\omega M)^2 R_L}{R_L^2 + (\\omega L_2)^2}$$\nThis is the first required expression.\n\nNext, we are asked to show that the real power delivered by the source to the coupled network is maximized when $R_{ref} = R_s$. The problem specifies to use \"the sinusoidal steady-state power expression for a Thevenin source feeding a load with real input resistance\". A Thevenin source with voltage $V_s$ and internal resistance $R_s$ delivers power to a resistive load $R_{load}$. The power delivered to the load is given by:\n$$P_{load} = |I|^2 R_{load} = \\left|\\frac{V_s}{R_s + R_{load}}\\right|^2 R_{load}$$\nAssuming $V_s$ is the RMS value, $P_{load} = \\frac{V_s^2 R_{load}}{(R_s + R_{load})^2}$. To find the maximum power, we differentiate $P_{load}$ with respect to $R_{load}$ and set the derivative to zero:\n$$\\frac{dP_{load}}{dR_{load}} = V_s^2 \\frac{(R_s + R_{load})^2 \\cdot 1 - R_{load} \\cdot 2(R_s + R_{load})}{ (R_s + R_{load})^4 } = 0$$\nFor the numerator to be zero (and $R_s+R_{load} \\neq 0$):\n$$(R_s + R_{load}) - 2R_{load} = 0$$\n$$R_s - R_{load} = 0 \\implies R_{load} = R_s$$\nThis is the well-known maximum power transfer theorem for resistive circuits.\nThe problem statement instructs us to apply this model by identifying the \"real input resistance\" of the coupled network with $R_{ref}$. Thus, by this analogy, the power delivered to the network is maximized when its effective real input resistance equals the source resistance.\n$$R_{ref} = R_s$$\nThis simplified approach, as specified, ignores the effect of the reactive part of the reflected impedance, $\\text{Im}(Z_{in})$.\n\nFinally, we must derive the expression(s) for the load resistance $R_L$ that satisfy this matching condition. We set the expression for $R_{ref}$ equal to $R_s$:\n$$R_s = \\frac{(\\omega M)^2 R_L}{R_L^2 + (\\omega L_2)^2}$$\nWe rearrange this equation to solve for $R_L$:\n$$R_s (R_L^2 + (\\omega L_2)^2) = (\\omega M)^2 R_L$$\n$$R_s R_L^2 + R_s (\\omega L_2)^2 - (\\omega M)^2 R_L = 0$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $R_L$ of the form $a R_L^2 + b R_L + c = 0$, with:\n$a = R_s$\n$b = -(\\omega M)^2$\n$c = R_s (\\omega L_2)^2$\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, $R_L = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$R_L = \\frac{(\\omega M)^2 \\pm \\sqrt{( -(\\omega M)^2 )^2 - 4(R_s)(R_s (\\omega L_2)^2)}}{2R_s}$$\n$$R_L = \\frac{(\\omega M)^2 \\pm \\sqrt{(\\omega M)^4 - 4 R_s^2 (\\omega L_2)^2}}{2R_s}$$\nThe problem states that matching is achievable, which implies the discriminant is non-negative, $(\\omega M)^4 - 4 R_s^2 (\\omega L_2)^2 \\ge 0$, guaranteeing real solutions for $R_L$. As the square root term is less than or equal to $(\\omega M)^2$, both solutions for $R_L$ are non-negative, representing physically valid resistances.\nThe two values of $R_L$ that achieve the matching condition $R_{ref} = R_s$ are:\n$$R_{L,1} = \\frac{(\\omega M)^2 + \\sqrt{(\\omega M)^4 - 4 R_s^2 (\\omega L_2)^2}}{2R_s}$$\n$$R_{L,2} = \\frac{(\\omega M)^2 - \\sqrt{(\\omega M)^4 - 4 R_s^2 (\\omega L_2)^2}}{2R_s}$$\nThese can be written more cleanly as:\n$$R_L = \\frac{\\omega^2 M^2 \\pm \\sqrt{\\omega^4 M^4 - 4 R_s^2 \\omega^2 L_2^2}}{2R_s}$$\nThese are the final closed-form expressions for the load resistance.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the maximum allowable peak magnetizing current, $I_{\\max}$, for a gapped ferrite core inductor such that the core material does not exceed a specified saturation-onset criterion. The derivation must start from fundamental principles.\n\nThe analysis begins with Ampère’s circuital law applied to the magnetic circuit, which consists of the ferrite core and an air gap. The magnetic circuit is driven by the magnetomotive force (MMF) produced by the $N$-turn winding carrying a current $I$. Assuming the magnetic field is uniform within the core ($H_c$) and the gap ($H_g$), Ampère's law is expressed as:\n$$NI = H_{c}l_{c} + H_{g}g$$\nwhere $l_c$ is the mean magnetic path length of the core and $g$ is the length of the air gap. $I$ represents the peak amplitude of the sinusoidal current.\n\nThe problem states that fringing effects are negligible, which implies that the magnetic flux $\\Phi$ is continuous throughout the magnetic circuit. As the cross-sectional area $A_c$ is uniform, the magnetic flux density $B$ is also continuous across the core-gap interface:\n$$B_{c} = B_{g}$$\n\nThe constitutive relations for the magnetic flux density in the core ($B_c$) and in the air gap ($B_g$) are given.

The peak current is $I_0 = I_{\\mathrm{rms}} \\sqrt{2} = 12\\sqrt{2}\\,\\mathrm{A}$, so $I_0^2 = 288\\,\\mathrm{A}^2$.\nSubstituting the given parameters ($L=8.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{H}$, $C=132\\,\\mathrm{nF}$, $V_{\\mathrm{lim}}=90\\,\\mathrm{V}$):\n$$C_{\\mathrm{add,min}} = \\frac{(8.5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{H}) (288\\,\\mathrm{A}^2)}{(90\\,\\mathrm{V})^2} - (132 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{F})$$\n$$C_{\\mathrm{add,min}} = \\frac{2.448 \\times 10^{-3}}{8100} - 132 \\times 10^{-9}$$\n$$C_{\\mathrm{add,min}} = 3.02222... \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{F} - 1.32 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{F}$$\n$$C_{\\mathrm{add,min}} = 1.70222... \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{F} = 0.170222...\\,\\mu\\mathrm{F}$$\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures gives $0.1702\\,\\mu\\mathrm{F}$.",
