This can be achieved by modeling the power-voltage ($P$-$V$) characteristic of the PV array around its Maximum Power Point (MPP).\n\nThe problem specifies that the $P$-$V$ characteristic, denoted by the function $P(V)$, is smooth and twice differentiable near the MPP voltage, $V^{*}$.

The incremental conductance method estimates the instantaneous slope of the power–voltage characteristic using finite differences between two samples separated by a fixed sampling time. The controller uses a fixed voltage perturbation and a decision deadband on the estimated slope to avoid dithering at the maximum power point (MPP).\n\nAssume the following physically realistic conditions and parameters:\n- The instantaneous string voltage around the MPP is approximately constant at the operating point within each sampling interval and equal to $V^{\\star} = 320 \\ \\mathrm{V}$.\n- The standard test condition (STC) irradiance is $G_{\\mathrm{STC}} = 1000 \\ \\mathrm{W} \\mathrm{m}^{-2}$, and the string short-circuit current at STC is $I_{\\mathrm{sc,STC}} = 8.0 \\ \\mathrm{A}$.\n- The photocurrent is linear in irradiance and temperature is constant over the interval, so that $\\partial I / \\partial G \\approx I_{\\mathrm{sc,STC}} / G_{\\mathrm{STC}}$ at fixed terminal voltage.\n- The MPPT controller applies a fixed voltage step of $\\Delta V = 4.0 \\ \\mathrm{V}$ between two current samples separated by the sampling period.

Let the sampling period be $T_s$. The state at time $t_k$ is $(V_k, I_k)$ and at time $t_{k+1} = t_k + T_s$ is $(V_{k+1}, I_{k+1})$. The controller imposes a voltage change $\\Delta V = V_{k+1} - V_k$ and measures the resulting current change $\\Delta I = I_{k+1} - I_k$. The estimated slope, as defined in the problem, is:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{est}} = I_k + V_k \\frac{\\Delta I}{\\Delta V}$$\nThe string current $I$ is a function of both voltage $V$ and irradiance $G$, so we write $I = I(V, G)$. A change in current $\\Delta I$ over a sampling interval is due to both the change in voltage $\\Delta V$ and the change in irradiance $\\Delta G = G_{k+1} - G_k$. Using a first-order Taylor series expansion (total differential approximation), the change in current can be expressed as:\n$$\\Delta I \\approx \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial V} \\Delta V + \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial G} \\Delta G$$\nwhere the partial derivatives are evaluated at the operating point $(V_k, G_k)$.
