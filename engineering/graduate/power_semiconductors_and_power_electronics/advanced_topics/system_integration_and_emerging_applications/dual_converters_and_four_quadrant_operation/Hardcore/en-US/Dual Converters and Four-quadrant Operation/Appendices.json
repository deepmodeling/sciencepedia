The output voltage of a phase-controlled dual converter is not a perfect DC signal; it contains harmonic ripple related to the AC line frequency.

            "problem": "A separately excited direct current (DC) motor is supplied by a dual converter composed of two fully controlled three-phase bridges connected back-to-back to enable four-quadrant operation. In circulating-current-free operation, only one bridge conducts at a time, and the motor armature is subjected to a rectified DC voltage that contains a dominant six-pulse ripple component at angular frequency $\\omega_6$ induced by the converter. Assume the supply frequency is $f_s$, so that $\\omega_s = 2\\pi f_s$ and $\\omega_6 = 6 \\omega_s = 12\\pi f_s$. The six-pulse ripple component at the armature terminals is modeled as a small-signal sinusoid $v_6(t) = V_6 \\cos(\\omega_6 t)$ superimposed on the average DC level, where $V_6$ is the peak amplitude of the ripple at frequency $\\omega_6$.\n\nThe motor armature circuit is modeled by an armature resistance $R_a$ in series with an armature inductance $L_a$. The motor back electromotive force (back-EMF) is $e_b(t) = K_e \\omega_m(t)$, where $K_e$ is the voltage constant and $\\omega_m(t)$ is the mechanical angular speed. The electromagnetic torque is $T(t) = K_t i_a(t)$, where $K_t$ is the torque constant and $i_a(t)$ is the armature current. Assume the mechanical time constant is much larger than $1/\\omega_6$, so that $\\omega_m(t)$ is effectively constant over a six-pulse cycle and the small-signal back-EMF variation at $\\omega_6$ can be neglected. The operating point average armature current is $I_{a0}$ (which may be positive or negative depending on quadrant), and the small-signal current ripple at $\\omega_6$ is $i_6(t)$.\n\nStarting from the fundamental armature voltage equation and these definitions and assumptions, derive from first principles a closed-form expression for the ratio $R$ of the peak torque ripple amplitude at $\\omega_6$ to the magnitude of the average torque, expressed as a function of the given parameters $V_6$, $R_a$, $L_a$, $f_s$, and $I_{a0}$.

The ratio $R$ is dimensionless; do not include any units in the final answer. No numerical evaluation is required.",
            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and well-posed. It describes a standard model in power electronics and electromechanical systems, free of any contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe derivation of the ratio $R$ begins with the fundamental voltage equation for the armature circuit of the separately excited DC motor. Applying Kirchhoff's voltage law to the armature loop yields:\n$$\nv_a(t) = R_a i_a(t) + L_a \\frac{di_a(t)}{dt} + e_b(t)\n$$\nwhere $v_a(t)$ is the terminal armature voltage, $i_a(t)$ is the armature current, $e_b(t)$ is the back-EMF, $R_a$ is the armature resistance, and $L_a$ is the armature inductance.\n\nThe total terminal voltage $v_a(t)$ is composed of an average DC component, $V_{a0}$, and a superimposed ripple component, which is dominated by the six-pulse harmonic. The problem models this ripple component as $v_6(t) = V_6 \\cos(\\omega_6 t)$. Thus, the armature voltage is:\n$$\nv_a(t) = V_{a0} + v_6(t)\n$$\nSimilarly, the armature current $i_a(t)$ can be decomposed into an average DC component, $I_{a0}$, and a ripple component, $i_6(t)$:\n$$\ni_a(t) = I_{a0} + i_6(t)\n$$\nThe problem states that due to the large mechanical time constant, the motor speed $\\omega_m(t)$ can be considered constant over the short period of a ripple cycle. Consequently, the back-EMF $e_b(t) = K_e \\omega_m(t)$ is treated as a constant DC value, $E_{b0}$, and its AC variation is negligible.\n\nSubstituting these decomposed forms into the armature voltage equation:\n$$\nV_{a0} + v_6(t) = R_a(I_{a0} + i_6(t)) + L_a \\frac{d}{dt}(I_{a0} + i_6(t)) + E_{b0}\n$$\nSince $I_{a0}$ and $E_{b0}$ are constants, the equation becomes:\n$$\nV_{a0} + v_6(t) = R_a I_{a0} + R_a i_6(t) + L_a \\frac{di_6(t)}{dt} + E_{b0}\n$$\nThe principle of superposition allows us to separate this into a DC (average) equation and an AC (ripple) equation.\nThe DC equation is:\n$$\nV_{a0} = R_a I_{a0} + E_{b0}\n$$\nThe AC equation, which governs the ripple components, is:\n$$\nv_6(t) = R_a i_6(t) + L_a \\frac{di_6(t)}{dt}\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation describing the response of the armature R-L circuit to the ripple voltage $v_6(t)$. To find the steady-state ripple current $i_6(t)$, we can use AC circuit analysis with phasors. The voltage ripple is $v_6(t) = V_6 \\cos(\\omega_6 t)$. The corresponding phasor is $\\mathbf{V}_6 = V_6$.\nThe impedance of the armature circuit at the ripple angular frequency $\\omega_6$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{Z}_a(\\omega_6) = R_a + j\\omega_6 L_a\n$$\nThe phasor for the ripple current, $\\mathbf{I}_6$, is found by Ohm's law in the frequency domain:\n$$\n\\mathbf{I}_6 = \\frac{\\mathbf{V}_6}{\\mathbf{Z}_a(\\omega_6)} = \\frac{V_6}{R_a + j\\omega_6 L_a}\n$$\nThe peak amplitude of the sinusoidal ripple current, denoted $I_{6,peak}$, is the magnitude of the phasor $\\mathbf{I}_6$:\n$$\nI_{6,peak} = |\\mathbf{I}_6| = \\left| \\frac{V_6}{R_a + j\\omega_6 L_a} \\right| = \\frac{|V_6|}{|R_a + j\\omega_6 L_a|}\n$$\nSince $V_6$ is defined as the peak amplitude, it is a non-negative real number. The magnitude of the complex impedance is $\\sqrt{R_a^2 + (\\omega_6 L_a)^2}$. Therefore:\n$$\nI_{6,peak} = \\frac{V_6}{\\sqrt{R_a^2 + (\\omega_6 L_a)^2}}\n$$\nThe electromagnetic torque is given by $T(t) = K_t i_a(t)$. Substituting the decomposed current:\n$$\nT(t) = K_t(I_{a0} + i_6(t)) = K_t I_{a0} + K_t i_6(t)\n$$\nThe average torque is $T_{avg} = K_t I_{a0}$.\nThe torque ripple component is $T_6(t) = K_t i_6(t)$. The peak amplitude of the torque ripple, $T_{6,peak}$, is:\n$$\nT_{6,peak} = K_t \\times (\\text{peak amplitude of } i_6(t)) = K_t I_{6,peak}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $I_{6,peak}$:\n$$\nT_{6,peak} = \\frac{K_t V_6}{\\sqrt{R_a^2 + (\\omega_6 L_a)^2}}\n$$\nThe problem defines the ratio $R$ as the peak amplitude of the torque ripple at $\\omega_6$ divided by the magnitude of the average torque:\n$$\nR \\equiv \\frac{T_{6,peak}}{|T_{avg}|} = \\frac{\\frac{K_t V_6}{\\sqrt{R_a^2 + (\\omega_6 L_a)^2}}}{|K_t I_{a0}|}\n$$\nThe torque constant $K_t$ is a positive physical constant, so $|K_t I_{a0}| = K_t|I_{a0}|$.

Assume the following device-level conduction model for each SCR: the instantaneous forward voltage drop is approximated by $v_{T}(i) = V_{T} + r_{T} i$, where $V_{T}$ is a constant threshold and $r_{T}$ is the dynamic resistance.

It contains a complete and consistent set of data and definitions required for a unique solution. The scenario is a standard problem in power electronics concerning the analysis of losses in a dual converter DC drive.\n\nThe core of the problem is to compute the total energy dissipated in the converter for two different operating strategies, non-circulating and circulating current mode, over a specified time interval $T$. The total energy dissipation $E$ is the time integral of the instantaneous power dissipation $p(t)$:\n$$E = \\int_{0}^{T} p(t) \\, dt$$\nThe instantaneous power dissipation in a component is the product of the voltage across it and the current through it, $p(t) = v(t)i(t)$.\n\nThe problem provides a linear model for the forward voltage drop across a single Silicon Controlled Rectifier (SCR): $v_{T}(i) = V_{T} + r_{T} i$, for a forward current $i  0$.

The voltage-driven limit on the ramp rate is thus determined by the condition $V_{\\mathrm{req}}(I_{d,2}) \\geq -V_{d,\\max}$.\n$$\ne_b + R_a I_{d,2} + L_a s \\geq -V_{d,\\max}\n$$\nSince we are looking for a negative ramp ($s0$), solving for the maximum magnitude gives:\n$$\n|s|_{\\mathrm{volt}} = \\frac{V_{d,\\max} + e_b + R_a I_{d,2}}{L_a}.\n$$\n\nIndependently, the Silicon Controlled Rectifier (SCR) imposes a device current rate of rise limit $s_{\\mathrm{thy}}$ that must not be exceeded:\n$$\n|s| \\leq s_{\\mathrm{thy}}.\n$$\n\nTherefore, the designed maximum constant-magnitude ramp that simultaneously respects both constraints is\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{dI_d}{dt}\\right|_{\\max} = \\min\\!\\left( |s|_{\\mathrm{volt}},\\ s_{\\mathrm{thy}} \\right).\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given parameters,\n$$\n|s|_{\\mathrm{volt}} = \\frac{600 + 220 + 0.2 \\times (-150)}{0.02} = \\frac{600 + 220 - 30}{0.02} = \\frac{790}{0.02} = 39{,}500\\ \\mathrm{A/s}.\n$$\nComparing to the SCR limit,\n$$\ns_{\\mathrm{thy}} = 3.6 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{A/s} = 36{,}000\\ \\mathrm{A/s}.\n$$\nHence,\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{dI_d}{dt}\\right|_{\\max} = \\min\\!\\left(39{,}500,\\ 36{,}000\\right) = 36{,}000\\ \\mathrm{A/s}.\n$$\nTaking the negative direction for the commanded decrease, the designed ramp is\n$$\n\\frac{dI_d}{dt}_{\\max} = -36{,}000\\ \\mathrm{A/s}.\n$$\n\nWith a constant-magnitude ramp, the transition time is simply the current excursion divided by the ramp magnitude:\n$$\n\\Delta I = I_{d,1} - I_{d,2} = 150 - (-150) = 300\\ \\mathrm{A},\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta t = \\frac{\\Delta I}{\\left|\\dfrac{dI_d}{dt}\\right|_{\\max}} = \\frac{300}{36{,}000} = \\frac{1}{120}\\ \\mathrm{s} \\approx 8.333 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}.\n$$\n\nRounded to four significant figures:\n- Maximum allowable current ramp magnitude: $3.600 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{A/s}$,\n- Minimum transition time: $8.333 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}$.\n\nThese selections prevent converter voltage saturation at the worst-case point in the reversal and ensure the SCR current rate of rise constraint is not violated, thereby avoiding overshoot during polarity reversal while achieving the shortest feasible transition time under the imposed limits.",
