The analysis begins with the fundamental principles of circuit theory applied to the specific topology of a Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC).\n\nIn a single phase-leg of an MMC, the common-mode circulating current path is driven by the internal common-mode voltage, $v_{\\text{int}}(t)$, and flows through the series combination of the upper and lower arm inductors.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of power electronics, specifically the operation of a Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC). The formulation is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. The provided parameters are within a realistic range for high-power applications.\n\nThe objective is to compute the gain in efficiency, $\\Delta \\eta$, resulting from the reduction of circulating currents in a three-phase MMC.\n\nFirst, we must derive the expression for the root-mean-square (RMS) current in a converter arm, $I_{\\text{arm,rms}}$. In an MMC, the current in the upper arm, $i_u(t)$, and the lower arm, $i_l(t)$, of a single phase leg are composed of two components: half of the alternating current (AC) phase current, $i_{\\text{ph}}(t)$, and the circulating current, $i_{\\text{circ}}(t)$.\n\nAccording to Kirchhoff's Current Law at the AC output node, the phase current is the difference between the upper and lower arm currents:\n$$i_{\\text{ph}}(t) = i_u(t) - i_l(t)$$\nThe circulating current is defined as the common-mode current flowing through the phase leg:\n$$i_{\\text{circ}}(t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(i_u(t) + i_l(t)\\right)$$\nSolving this system of equations for the arm currents yields:\n$$i_u(t) = i_{\\text{circ}}(t) + \\frac{1}{2} i_{\\text{ph}}(t)$$\n$$i_l(t) = i_{\\text{circ}}(t) - \\frac{1}{2} i_{\\text{ph}}(t)$$\nSince the RMS values for $i_u(t)$ and $i_l(t)$ are identical, we can denote a generic arm current as $i_{\\text{arm}}(t) = i_{\\text{circ}}(t) \\pm \\frac{1}{2}i_{\\text{ph}}(t)$.\n\nThe mean square value of the arm current, $I_{\\text{arm,rms}}^2$, is the time average of its square:\n$$I_{\\text{arm,rms}}^2 = \\left\\langle \\left( i_{\\text{circ}}(t) \\pm \\frac{1}{2}i_{\\text{ph}}(t) \\right)^2 \\right\\rangle$$\nExpanding the squared term gives:\n$$I_{\\text{arm,rms}}^2 = \\left\\langle i_{\\text{circ}}(t)^2 \\right\\rangle + \\left\\langle \\left(\\frac{1}{2}i_{\\text{ph}}(t)\\right)^2 \\right\\rangle \\pm \\left\\langle i_{\\text{circ}}(t) i_{\\text{ph}}(t) \\right\\rangle$$\nThe problem states that the phase current is a pure sinusoid at frequency $f$, and the circulating current is a pure sinusoid at frequency $2f$. For sinusoidal signals of different frequencies, the time average of their product over a period that is an integer multiple of both fundamental periods is zero. They are uncorrelated. Thus, the cross-term $\\left\\langle i_{\\text{circ}}(t) i_{\\text{ph}}(t) \\right\\rangle = 0$.\nThe expression simplifies to the sum of the mean square values of the components:\n$$I_{\\text{arm,rms}}^2 = \\left\\langle i_{\\text{circ}}(t)^2 \\right\\rangle + \\frac{1}{4} \\left\\langle i_{\\text{ph}}(t)^2 \\right\\rangle$$\nBy definition, $\\langle x(t)^2 \\rangle = X_{\\text{rms}}^2$.

The solution will proceed by calculating the power flowing into the SM capacitors, identifying the component that causes the ripple, determining the residual ripple power under saturated control, and finally relating this power ripple to the voltage ripple on the SM capacitors.\n\nThe total instantaneous power flowing into the capacitors of the entire leg, $p_{leg}(t)$, is the net power entering the leg from the DC side minus the power exiting to the AC side. This is given by the fundamental power balance equation for the leg:\n$$p_{leg}(t) = v_{dc} i_{z}(t) - v_{a}(t) i_{a}(t)$$\nHere, $v_{dc} i_{z}(t)$ is the power drawn from the DC source via the circulating current, and $v_{a}(t) i_{a}(t)$ is the instantaneous power delivered to the AC side.
