The derivation starts from fundamental principles of charge transport.\n\nFirst, we begin with the provided drift current density relation for electrons:\n$$\nJ = q n \\mu_{n} E\n$$\nwhere $J$ is the current density, $q$ is the elementary charge, $n$ is the electron concentration, $\\mu_{n}$ is the electron mobility, and $E$ is the electric field magnitude.\n\nOhm's law in its point form relates current density to the electric field via the material's electrical conductivity, $\\sigma$:\n$$\nJ = \\sigma E\n$$\nBy comparing these two expressions for $J$, we can express the conductivity in terms of the microscopic charge transport parameters:\n$$\n\\sigma = q n \\mu_{n}\n$$\nThe problem specifies a uniformly doped $n$-type drift region and assumes low-level injection.

The derivation will be based on the first principles of electrical power dissipation and steady-state thermal transport.\n\nFirst, we address the electrical aspect. The instantaneous electrical power, $P$, dissipated in any two-terminal component is the product of the voltage, $V$, across its terminals and the current, $I$, flowing through it.\n$$P = V \\cdot I$$\nFor the MOSFET in this problem, the relevant quantities are the drain-to-source voltage, $V_{\\mathrm{DS}}$, and the drain current, $I$. The problem states that resistive (conduction) losses dominate. Therefore, the total power dissipated as heat in the device, $P_D$, can be approximated by the conduction power, $P_{\\mathrm{cond}}$.\n$$P_D \\approx P_{\\mathrm{cond}} = V_{\\mathrm{DS}} \\cdot I$$\nThe problem specifies that the device is in steady-state conduction under strong inversion, where its channel behaves ohmically. This corresponds to the linear (or triode) region of operation for a MOSFET. In this regime, the drain-to-source path can be modeled as a simple resistor with resistance $R_{\\mathrm{DS(on)}}$.

The problem states that the device is in steady-state and has a linear thermal path from the junction to the ambient, characterized by a thermal resistance $R_{\\theta \\mathrm{JA}}$. The fundamental principle of linear, steady-state heat conduction states that the temperature difference (temperature rise), $\\Delta T$, across a thermal path is directly proportional to the constant heat flow, $P$, through it. The constant of proportionality is the thermal resistance, $R_{\\theta}$.\n$$\\Delta T = P \\cdot R_{\\theta}$$\nIn our case, the heat flow is the power dissipated in the device, $P_D$. The temperature rise is from the junction to the ambient, $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{JA}} = T_J - T_A$, where $T_J$ is the junction temperature and $T_A$ is the ambient temperature. The corresponding thermal resistance is $R_{\\theta \\mathrm{JA}}$.
