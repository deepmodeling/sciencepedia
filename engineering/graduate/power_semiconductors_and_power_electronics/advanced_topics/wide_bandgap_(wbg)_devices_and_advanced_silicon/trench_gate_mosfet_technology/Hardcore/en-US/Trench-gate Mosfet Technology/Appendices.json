The derivation starts from fundamental principles of charge transport.\n\nFirst, we begin with the provided drift current density relation for electrons:\n$$\nJ = q n \\mu_{n} E\n$$\nwhere $J$ is the current density, $q$ is the elementary charge, $n$ is the electron concentration, $\\mu_{n}$ is the electron mobility, and $E$ is the electric field magnitude.\n\nOhm's law in its point form relates current density to the electric field via the material's electrical conductivity, $\\sigma$:\n$$\nJ = \\sigma E\n$$\nBy comparing these two expressions for $J$, we can express the conductivity in terms of the microscopic charge transport parameters:\n$$\n\\sigma = q n \\mu_{n}\n$$\nThe problem specifies a uniformly doped $n$-type drift region and assumes low-level injection. Under these conditions, the majority carrier (electron) concentration $n$ is approximately equal to the net concentration of ionized donor atoms, $N_{D}$. Thus, we can write:\n$$\nn \\approx N_{D}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for conductivity yields:\n$$\n\\sigma \\approx q N_{D} \\mu_{n}\n$$\nNext, we consider the macroscopic resistance, $R$, of a uniform slab of material. The resistance is defined in terms of the material's resistivity, $\\rho$, its length, $L$, and its cross-sectional area, $A$, as:\n$$\nR = \\rho \\frac{L}{A}\n$$\nResistivity $\\rho$ is the reciprocal of conductivity $\\sigma$, so $\\rho = 1/\\sigma$. Substituting this into the resistance formula gives:\n$$\nR = \\frac{1}{\\sigma} \\frac{L}{A}\n$$\nFinally, substituting our derived expression for conductivity results in the desired formula for the drift-region resistance:\n$$\nR = \\frac{L}{q N_{D} \\mu_{n} A}\n$$\nThis expression gives the resistance in terms of fundamental constants and the specified material and geometric properties.\n\nNow, we proceed to the numerical evaluation.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the shift in the threshold voltage, $\\Delta V_{th}$, of an $n$-channel trench-gate MOSFET caused by a uniform fixed positive oxide charge located at the silicon-oxide interface. This problem is rooted in the fundamental electrostatic principles of the Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) structure.\n\nThe threshold voltage, $V_{th}$, is the gate voltage required to induce a state of strong inversion at the semiconductor surface, thereby forming a conducting channel. Any fixed charge present in the gate oxide or at its interface with the semiconductor will alter the electric field distribution within the MOS structure. This, in turn, changes the gate voltage required to achieve inversion, resulting in a shift in the threshold voltage.\n\nThe fixed oxide charge, with an areal density $Q_{ox}$ (in units of charge per area), is specified to be located at the oxide-silicon interface. This charge induces an equal and opposite charge in the gate and the semiconductor. The portion of this induced charge on the gate gives rise to a voltage shift across the oxide. The shift in the threshold voltage, $\\Delta V_{th}$, due to this charge is equal to the negative of the voltage drop that the fixed charge itself would create across the oxide capacitance. This relationship is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta V_{th} = -\\frac{Q_{ox}}{C_{ox}}\n$$\nwhere $C_{ox}$ is the gate oxide capacitance per unit area. A positive fixed charge ($Q_{ox} > 0$) for an $n$-channel device (on a $p$-type substrate) helps to attract electrons to the interface, thus reducing the magnitude of the positive gate voltage needed to form the channel. This results in a negative shift, $\\Delta V_{th} < 0$, which corresponds to a reduction in the threshold voltage.\n\nThe problem provides all the necessary parameters to calculate $Q_{ox}$ and $C_{ox}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the oxide capacitance per unit area, $C_{ox}$. The problem states that the local sidewall oxide can be modeled as a parallel-plate capacitor. The capacitance per unit area for a parallel-plate capacitor is given by:\n$$\nC_{ox} = \\frac{\\epsilon_{ox}}{t_{ox}}\n$$\nWe are given the oxide permittivity, $\\epsilon_{ox} = 3.45 \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\text{F/cm}$, and the oxide thickness, $t_{ox} = 35\\,\\text{nm}$.

This is the product of the elementary charge, $q$, and the given areal density of fixed charges, $N_{ox}$.\nWe are given:\n- Elementary charge, $q = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{C}$\n- Areal density of fixed charges, $N_{ox} = 5 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\text{cm}^{-2}$\n\nSo, $Q_{ox}$ is calculated as:\n$$\nQ_{ox} = q \\cdot N_{ox} = (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{C}) \\cdot (5 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\text{cm}^{-2})\n$$\n$$\nQ_{ox} = 8.01088317 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\text{C/cm}^2\n$$\n\nFinally, we can calculate the threshold voltage shift, $\\Delta V_{th}$, by substituting the values of $Q_{ox}$ and $C_{ox}$ into the primary equation.
