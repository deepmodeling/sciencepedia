            "problem": "A designer must select an appropriate device technology for paralleling in a high-current, low-voltage converter. Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFETs), Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs), and Insulated-Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs) exhibit different temperature coefficients of conduction. Start from the following fundamental bases: Ohm's law $V = I R$; the definition of a temperature coefficient as the proportional change of a parameter per unit temperature; and the approximation that junction temperature rise is proportional to dissipated power with proportionality $\\Theta_{\\mathrm{JA}}$ (junction-to-ambient thermal resistance). Using these, first argue why a positive temperature coefficient of MOSFET on-state resistance $R_{\\text{DS(on)}}$ promotes stable current sharing when devices are paralleled, in contrast to BJTs whose collector current obeys $I_{\\mathrm{C}} \\approx I_{\\mathrm{S}} \\exp(V_{\\mathrm{BE}}/(n V_{\\mathrm{T}}))$ with $V_{\\mathrm{T}} = k_{B} T / q$, leading to a negative temperature coefficient of the required base-emitter voltage for a given current and a tendency for current hogging.

Express the final answer as a pure number (no units) and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "**Part 1: Qualitative Argument**\n\nThe stability of paralleled power semiconductor devices depends critically on the temperature coefficient of their on-state voltage drop.\n\nFor a Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET), the on-state resistance, $R_{\\text{DS(on)}}$, has a positive temperature coefficient. Consider two MOSFETs in parallel, sharing a total current. If one device, say MOSFET $1$, begins to conduct slightly more current ($I_1$), its power dissipation, $P_1 = I_1^2 R_{\\text{DS(on),1}}$, increases. This leads to a rise in its junction temperature, $T_1$. Due to the positive temperature coefficient, $R_{\\text{DS(on),1}}$ increases. Since both devices are in parallel, they must have the same voltage drop, $V_{\\mathrm{DS}}$. From Ohm's law, $V_{\\mathrm{DS}} = I_1 R_{\\text{DS(on),1}}$. The increase in $R_{\\text{DS(on),1}}$ forces its current $I_1$ to decrease, thereby counteracting the initial perturbation and diverting current to the other, cooler device. This inherent negative feedback mechanism promotes stable, self-balancing current sharing.\n\nFor a Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT), the behavior is dictated by the exponential relationship between collector current $I_{\\mathrm{C}}$ and base-emitter voltage $V_{\\mathrm{BE}}$, given by $I_{\\mathrm{C}} \\approx I_{\\mathrm{S}} \\exp(V_{\\mathrm{BE}}/(n V_{\\mathrm{T}}))$. The thermal voltage is $V_{\\mathrm{T}} = k_{B} T / q$, and the saturation current $I_{\\mathrm{S}}$ is itself strongly dependent on temperature, increasing rapidly as temperature rises. The dominant effect is the change in $I_{\\mathrm{S}}$. For a fixed $V_{\\mathrm{BE}}$ (as would be the case for paralleled devices), an increase in temperature causes a significant increase in $I_{\\mathrm{C}}$. This is equivalent to saying that for a fixed $I_{\\mathrm{C}}$, the required $V_{\\mathrm{BE}}$ decreases with temperature (a negative temperature coefficient). If one BJT begins to conduct more current, it heats up, which in turn causes it to conduct even more current for the same $V_{\\mathrm{BE}}$. This positive feedback loop leads to \"current hogging,\" where the hotter device draws progressively more of the total current, potentially leading to thermal runaway and device destruction.\n\nAn Insulated-Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) is a composite device, exhibiting characteristics of both a MOSFET (at its input gate) and a BJT (at its output). Its on-state voltage drop, $V_{\\text{CE(sat)}}$, is the sum of a diode-like drop and a resistive drop. At low currents, the diode-like behavior dominates, resulting in a negative temperature coefficient similar to a BJT. At high currents, the resistive component becomes more significant, introducing a positive temperature coefficient. Consequently, an IGBT's overall temperature coefficient can be negative, positive, or transition between the two depending on the operating current. For stable paralleling, IGBTs are typically operated at sufficiently high currents to ensure they are in the positive temperature coefficient region.\n\n**Part 2: Quantitative Calculation**\n\nThe problem provides the following system of equations for two parallel MOSFETs:\n1. Current sharing: $I_{1} + I_{2} = I_{\\mathrm{tot}}$\n2. Parallel voltage equality: $I_{1} R_{1}(T_{1}) = I_{2} R_{2}(T_{2})$\n3. Approximated resistance: $R_{i}(T_{i}) \\approx R_{i0} \\left[1 + \\alpha \\Theta_{\\mathrm{JA}} I_{i}^{2} R_{i0}\\right]$ for $i=1,2$.\n\nLet's define the thermal feedback factor $\\beta = \\alpha \\Theta_{\\mathrm{JA}}$. The voltage equality becomes:\n$$I_{1} R_{10} \\left(1 + \\beta R_{10} I_{1}^{2}\\right) = I_{2} R_{20} \\left(1 + \\beta R_{20} I_{2}^{2}\\right)$$\nExpanding this gives a non-linear equation:\n$$I_{1} R_{10} + \\beta R_{10}^{2} I_{1}^{3} = I_{2} R_{20} + \\beta R_{20}^{2} I_{2}^{3}$$\nThis system is difficult to solve directly. We can use a perturbation approach. First, we find the zeroth-order (\"cold\") solution where there is no thermal feedback ($\\beta=0$):\n$$I_{1c} R_{10} = I_{2c} R_{20}$$\nCombined with $I_{1c} + I_{2c} = I_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, we solve for the cold currents:\n$$I_{1c} = I_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\frac{R_{20}}{R_{10} + R_{20}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad I_{2c} = I_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\frac{R_{10}}{R_{10} + R_{20}}$$\nNext, we approximate the full non-linear equation by substituting these cold currents into the small cubic terms:\n$$I_{1} R_{10} + \\beta R_{10}^{2} I_{1c}^{3} \\approx I_{2} R_{20} + \\beta R_{20}^{2} I_{2c}^{3}$$\nThis yields a linear system for the thermally-corrected currents $I_1$ and $I_2$:\n$$I_{1} + I_{2} = I_{\\mathrm{tot}}$$\n$$I_{1} R_{10} - I_{2} R_{20} = C$$\nwhere the constant $C$ is defined as $C = \\beta \\left( R_{20}^{2} I_{2c}^{3} - R_{10}^{2} I_{1c}^{3} \\right)$.\nWe solve this system by substituting $I_1 = I_{\\mathrm{tot}} - I_2$ into the second equation:\n$$(I_{\\mathrm{tot}} - I_2) R_{10} - I_2 R_{20} = C$$\n$$I_{\\mathrm{tot}} R_{10} - I_2 (R_{10} + R_{20}) = C$$\n$$I_2 = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{tot}} R_{10} - C}{R_{10} + R_{20}}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$R_{10} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\Omega$, $R_{20} = 2.2 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\Omega$, $\\alpha = 0.006 \\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, $\\Theta_{\\mathrm{JA}} = 0.30 \\ \\mathrm{K/W}$, $I_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 100 \\ \\mathrm{A}$.\n\nFirst, calculate the thermal factor $\\beta$:\n$$\\beta = \\alpha \\Theta_{\\mathrm{JA}} = (0.006 \\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}) (0.30 \\ \\mathrm{K/W}) = 0.0018 \\ \\mathrm{W}^{-1}$$\nNext, calculate the cold currents $I_{1c}$ and $I_{2c}$:\n$$R_{10} + R_{20} = 4.2 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\Omega$$\n$$I_{1c} = 100 \\ \\mathrm{A} \\times \\frac{2.2 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\Omega}{4.2 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\Omega} = \\frac{1100}{21} \\ \\mathrm{A} \\approx 52.38095 \\ \\mathrm{A}$$\n$$I_{2c} = 100 \\ \\mathrm{A} \\times \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\Omega}{4.2 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\Omega} = \\frac{1000}{21} \\ \\mathrm{A} \\approx 47.61905 \\ \\mathrm{A}$$\nNow, calculate the constant $C$:\n$$R_{10}^{2} = (2.0 \\times 10^{-3})^2 = 4.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\Omega^2$$\n$$R_{20}^{2} = (2.2 \\times 10^{-3})^2 = 4.84 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\Omega^2$$\n$$I_{1c}^{3} \\approx (52.38095)^3 \\approx 143717.46 \\ \\mathrm{A}^3$$\n$$I_{2c}^{3} \\approx (47.61905)^3 \\approx 107958.05 \\ \\mathrm{A}^3$$\n$C = 0.0018 \\ \\mathrm{W}^{-1} \\left( (4.84 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\Omega^2)(107958.05 \\ \\mathrm{A}^3) - (4.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\Omega^2)(143717.46 \\ \\mathrm{A}^3) \\right)$\n$C = 0.0018 \\left( 0.522417 - 0.574870 \\right) \\ \\mathrm{V} = 0.0018(-0.052453) \\ \\mathrm{V} \\approx -9.4415 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{V}$\nNow, solve for $I_2$:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{tot}} R_{10} = (100 \\ \\mathrm{A})(2.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\Omega) = 0.2 \\ \\mathrm{V}$$\n$$I_2 = \\frac{0.2 \\ \\mathrm{V} - (-9.4415 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{V})}{4.2 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\Omega} = \\frac{0.200094415}{4.2 \\times 10^{-3}} \\ \\mathrm{A} \\approx 47.64153 \\ \\mathrm{A}$$\nThen, solve for $I_1$:\n$$I_1 = I_{\\mathrm{tot}} - I_2 = 100 \\ \\mathrm{A} - 47.64153 \\ \\mathrm{A} = 52.35847 \\ \\mathrm{A}$$\nFinally, compute the required ratio $I_1/I_2$:\n$$\\frac{I_1}{I_2} = \\frac{52.35847}{47.64153} \\approx 1.099009$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $1.099$.",

            "solution": "**Part 1: Derivation of the Maximum Permissible Slew Rate $\\left(\\frac{dV_{CE}}{dt}\\right)_{\\max}$**\n\nWe begin by modeling the IGBT's gate circuit during the off-state collector-emitter voltage slew. The gate node is subject to currents from the gate driver and from capacitive coupling. We apply Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at the gate terminal. The emitter is the reference node, so the gate-emitter voltage is denoted as $v_{GE}(t)$.\n\nThe circuit consists of:\n1.  The gate drive impedance, modeled as a Thevenin equivalent: a voltage source $V_b$ in series with a resistor $R_g$.\n2.  The gate-emitter capacitance, $C_{ge}$, connecting the gate to the emitter.\n3.  The gate-collector (Miller) capacitance, $C_{gc}$, connecting the gate to the collector.\n\nAccording to KCL, the sum of currents leaving the gate node is zero.\n$$\ni_{R_g}(t) + i_{C_{ge}}(t) + i_{C_{gc}}(t) = 0\n$$\nThe individual currents are expressed as follows:\n- The current through the gate resistor $R_g$ is given by Ohm's law:\n$$\ni_{R_g}(t) = \\frac{v_{GE}(t) - V_b}{R_g}\n$$\n- The current through the gate-emitter capacitor $C_{ge}$ is:\n$$\ni_{C_{ge}}(t) = C_{ge} \\frac{dv_{GE}(t)}{dt}\n$$\n- The current through the gate-collector capacitor $C_{gc}$ depends on the voltage across it, $v_{GC}(t) = v_{GE}(t) - v_{CE}(t)$. Its current is:\n$$\ni_{C_{gc}}(t) = C_{gc} \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( v_{GE}(t) - v_{CE}(t) \\right) = C_{gc} \\left( \\frac{dv_{GE}(t)}{dt} - \\frac{dv_{CE}(t)}{dt} \\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that the collector-emitter voltage slews at a constant rate $\\alpha = \\frac{dV_{CE}}{dt}$. Substituting this into the expression for $i_{C_{gc}}$ gives:\n$$\ni_{C_{gc}}(t) = C_{gc} \\left( \\frac{dv_{GE}(t)}{dt} - \\alpha \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting these current expressions back into the KCL equation:\n$$\n\\frac{v_{GE}(t) - V_b}{R_g} + C_{ge} \\frac{dv_{GE}(t)}{dt} + C_{gc} \\left( \\frac{dv_{GE}(t)}{dt} - \\alpha \\right) = 0\n$$\nWe now rearrange this equation to form a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for $v_{GE}(t)$.\n$$\n\\left( C_{ge} + C_{gc} \\right) \\frac{dv_{GE}(t)}{dt} + \\frac{1}{R_g} v_{GE}(t) = \\frac{V_b}{R_g} + C_{gc} \\alpha\n$$\nThis is an equation of the form $\\tau \\frac{dy}{dt} + y = K$, where $y = v_{GE}(t)$. The solution for $v_{GE}(t)$ with the initial condition $v_{GE}(0) = V_b$ (the steady-state voltage before the transient begins at $t=0$) is:\n$$\nv_{GE}(t) = v_{GE,ss} + \\left( v_{GE}(0) - v_{GE,ss} \\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)\n$$\nHere, the time constant is $\\tau = R_g (C_{ge} + C_{gc})$, and the final steady-state value (as $t \\to \\infty$) is found by setting $\\frac{dv_{GE}}{dt} = 0$:\n$$\nv_{GE,ss} = R_g \\left( \\frac{V_b}{R_g} + C_{gc} \\alpha \\right) = V_b + R_g C_{gc} \\alpha\n$$\nSubstituting the initial condition $v_{GE}(0) = V_b$ and the steady-state value $v_{GE,ss}$ into the general solution:\n$$\nv_{GE}(t) = (V_b + R_g C_{gc} \\alpha) + (V_b - (V_b + R_g C_{gc} \\alpha)) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{R_g(C_{ge} + C_{gc})}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nv_{GE}(t) = V_b + R_g C_{gc} \\alpha \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{R_g(C_{ge} + C_{gc})}\\right) \\right)\n$$\nTo prevent unintended turn-on, the instantaneous gate-emitter voltage $v_{GE}(t)$ must remain below the allowable bound $V_{\\mathrm{allow}}$ for all time $t \\ge 0$. We must find the maximum value of $v_{GE}(t)$. The term $1 - \\exp(-\\frac{t}{\\tau})$ is a monotonically increasing function starting from $0$ at $t=0$ and approaching $1$ as $t \\to \\infty$. Therefore, the maximum value of $v_{GE}(t)$ occurs at $t \\to \\infty$:\n$$\nv_{GE,\\max} = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} v_{GE}(t) = V_b + R_g C_{gc} \\alpha\n$$\nThe condition to avoid unintended turn-on is $v_{GE,\\max} \\le V_{\\mathrm{allow}}$.\n$$\nV_b + R_g C_{gc} \\alpha \\le V_{\\mathrm{allow}}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\alpha = \\frac{dV_{CE}}{dt}$:\n$$\nV_b + R_g C_{gc} \\frac{dV_{CE}}{dt} \\le V_{\\mathrm{allow}}\n$$\nSolving for the slew rate $\\frac{dV_{CE}}{dt}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dV_{CE}}{dt} \\le \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{allow}} - V_b}{R_g C_{gc}}\n$$\nThe maximum permissible collector-emitter slew rate is the upper limit of this inequality:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{dV_{CE}}{dt}\\right)_{\\max} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{allow}} - V_b}{R_g C_{gc}}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Minimum Negative Gate Bias $|V_b|$**\n\nWe use the inequality derived above, $V_b + R_g C_{gc} \\alpha \\le V_{\\mathrm{allow}}$, and solve for the required bias voltage $V_b$.\n$$\nV_b \\le V_{\\mathrm{allow}} - R_g C_{gc} \\alpha\n$$\nTo ensure the condition is met, $V_b$ must be less than or equal to the value on the right-hand side. Since $V_b$ is a negative bias, this inequality sets a maximum (least negative) value for $V_b$. To find the minimum *magnitude* $|V_b|$, we evaluate this boundary condition.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- $V_{\\mathrm{allow}} = 2.0\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n- $R_{g} = 5.0\\ \\Omega$\n- $C_{gc} = 120\\ \\mathrm{pF} = 120 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{F}$\n- $\\alpha = 8.0\\ \\mathrm{kV}/\\mu\\mathrm{s} = 8.0 \\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{V} / 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{s} = 8.0 \\times 10^9\\ \\mathrm{V/s}$\n\nFirst, calculate the term $R_g C_{gc} \\alpha$:\n$$\nR_g C_{gc} \\alpha = (5.0\\ \\Omega) \\times (120 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{F}) \\times (8.0 \\times 10^9\\ \\mathrm{V/s})\n$$\n$$\nR_g C_{gc} \\alpha = 5.0 \\times 120 \\times 8.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{V} = 4800 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{V} = 4.8\\ \\mathrm{V}\n$$\nNow, substitute this into the inequality for $V_b$:\n$$\nV_b \\le 2.0\\ \\mathrm{V} - 4.8\\ \\mathrm{V} = -2.8\\ \\mathrm{V}\n$$\nThis means that any negative bias voltage $V_b$ equal to or more negative than $-2.8\\ \\mathrm{V}$ (e.g., $-3.0\\ \\mathrm{V}$, $-5.0\\ \\mathrm{V}$) will prevent unintended turn-on. The minimum required negative bias is thus $V_b = -2.8\\ \\mathrm{V}$. The problem asks for the minimum *magnitude* of this negative bias, which is:\n$$\n|V_b|_{\\min} = |-2.8\\ \\mathrm{V}| = 2.8\\ \\mathrm{V}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested gives $2.80\\ \\mathrm{V}$.\n\n**Part 3: Qualitative Comparison of IGBT, MOSFET, and BJT**\n\nThe susceptibility to unintended turn-on via Miller capacitance coupling for a given slew rate $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ is fundamentally determined by two factors: the magnitude of the Miller capacitance itself ($C_{gc}$ for IGBT/MOSFET, $C_{bc}$ for BJT) and the off-state input impedance of the control terminal (gate or base).\n\n- **MOSFET and IGBT**: Both are voltage-controlled devices with a Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) gate structure. This gate is electrically isolated from the channel/drift region by a thin-film insulator (e.g., $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$), resulting in a very high DC input impedance. In the off-state, the input looks like a capacitor. The current $i_c = C_{gc} \\frac{dV_{CE}}{dt}$ injected by the Miller effect must flow through the gate drive circuit impedance, which consists of $R_g$ and $C_{ge}$. This current develops a voltage $v_{GE}$ primarily across this external impedance. Because the intrinsic input impedance is so high, even a small injected current can cause a significant voltage rise, potentially exceeding the threshold voltage $V_{th}$ and causing unintended turn-on. Therefore, both MOSFETs and IGBTs are highly susceptible to this phenomenon. Their robustness is almost entirely dependent on the external gate drive circuit (low $R_g$, negative bias $V_b$).\n\n- **BJT (Bipolar Junction Transistor)**: The BJT is a current-controlled device. Its control terminal is the base. In the off-state, the base-emitter junction is typically held at zero or negative bias (reverse-biased) through a low-impedance path, such as a base-emitter resistor $R_{BE}$. The off-state input impedance looking into the base is dominated by this external low resistance, which is orders of magnitude smaller than the gate drive resistance $R_g$ used for a typical MOSFET or IGBT. Although a Miller capacitance ($C_{bc}$) exists and injects a current $i_c = C_{bc} \\frac{dV_{CB}}{dt}$ into the base, this current is shunted to the emitter through the very low impedance path. The resulting base-emitter voltage spike $v_{BE} = i_c \\times Z_{in}$ is consequently much smaller than the gate voltage spike in a comparable MOS-gated device. To turn a BJT on, a significant base current must be supplied to forward bias the B-E junction, not just a voltage spike.\n\n- **Comparison and Conclusion**: The BJT is inherently far less susceptible to $\\frac{dV}{dt}$-induced turn-on than MOSFETs or IGBTs. This is not because its Miller capacitance is necessarily smaller, but because its control terminal is low-impedance and current-driven, whereas MOS-gated devices have high-impedance, voltage-driven gates. For high $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ applications, while a BJT might seem more robust in this specific regard, its other performance limitations (e.g., slower switching speed, DC current draw for the driver) often make MOSFETs and IGBTs the preferred choice. The selection of a MOSFET or IGBT for such an application mandates careful gate driver design, specifically incorporating a low-impedance path and a negative off-state bias voltage to actively pull down the gate and counteract the Miller-injected current, as demonstrated in the preceding calculation.",
