The solution proceeds in three stages: first, validating the provided baseline static model against the long-time measurement; second, deriving an analytical model for the time-dependent on-resistance $R_{on}(t)$; and third, using the derived model and the measured data to calculate $\\tau$.\n\n**1. Verification of the Baseline Static Model**\n\nThe problem states that the static on-resistance $R_{on,0}$ is the sum of the drift-region resistance $R_{drift}$ and the steady-state channel resistance $R_{ch,0}$. The channel resistance in the linear region is given by $R_{ch} = 1/(k V_{ov})$, where $V_{ov}$ is the channel overdrive voltage.\n\nGiven the steady-state channel parameter $k = 10\\ \\mathrm{S}/\\mathrm{V}$ and the steady-state overdrive $V_{ov,0} = 12\\ \\mathrm{V}$, the static channel resistance $R_{ch,0}$ is:\n$$R_{ch,0} = \\frac{1}{k V_{ov,0}} = \\frac{1}{(10\\ \\mathrm{S}/\\mathrm{V}) \\times (12\\ \\mathrm{V})} = \\frac{1}{120\\ \\mathrm{S}} = \\frac{1}{120}\\ \\Omega$$\nNumerically, this is $R_{ch,0} \\approx 8.333\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega$.\n\nThe total static on-resistance $R_{on,0}$ is then calculated by adding the given drift-region resistance $R_{drift} = 31.7\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega$:\n$$R_{on,0} = R_{drift} + R_{ch,0} = 31.7\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega + \\frac{1000}{120}\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega \\approx 31.7\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega + 8.333\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega \\approx 40.033\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega$$\nThe measured on-resistance at a long time $t = 5\\ \\mathrm{ms}$ is $R_{on}(5\\ \\mathrm{ms}) = 40\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega$. The calculated value of $R_{on,0} \\approx 40.033\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega$ is in excellent agreement with this measurement.

Henceforth, we use the measured value $R_{on,0} = 40\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega$ as the steady-state resistance.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Time-Dependent On-Resistance Model**\n\nThe total on-resistance at any time $t$ is the sum of the constant drift resistance and the time-dependent channel resistance:\n$$R_{on}(t) = R_{drift} + R_{ch}(t)$$\nThe dynamic behavior is due to trapped electrons near the interface, which cause a transient shift in the threshold voltage, $\\Delta V_{th}(t)$. This shift reduces the channel overdrive voltage:\n$$V_{ov}(t) = V_{GS} - V_{th}(t) = V_{GS} - (V_{th,0} + \\Delta V_{th}(t)) = (V_{GS} - V_{th,0}) - \\Delta V_{th}(t) = V_{ov,0} - \\Delta V_{th}(t)$$\nThe time-dependent channel resistance is therefore:\n$$R_{ch}(t) = \\frac{1}{k V_{ov}(t)} = \\frac{1}{k (V_{ov,0} - \\Delta V_{th}(t))}$$\nTo simplify this expression, we factor out the steady-state term $k V_{ov,0}$:\n$$R_{ch}(t) = \\frac{1}{k V_{ov,0} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\Delta V_{th}(t)}{V_{ov,0}}\\right)} = R_{ch,0} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\Delta V_{th}(t)}{V_{ov,0}}\\right)^{-1}$$\nThe problem asks for an expression to leading order in the small quantity $x = \\Delta V_{th}(t)/V_{ov,0}$. Using the Taylor series expansion $(1-x)^{-1} \\approx 1 + x$ for $|x| \\ll 1$, we get:\n$$R_{ch}(t) \\approx R_{ch,0} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta V_{th}(t)}{V_{ov,0}}\\right)$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the total on-resistance:\n$$R_{on}(t) = R_{drift} + R_{ch}(t) \\approx R_{drift} + R_{ch,0} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta V_{th}(t)}{V_{ov,0}}\\right)$$\n$$R_{on}(t) \\approx (R_{drift} + R_{ch,0}) + R_{ch,0} \\frac{\\Delta V_{th}(t)}{V_{ov,0}}$$\nRecognizing that $R_{on,0} = R_{drift} + R_{ch,0}$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$R_{on}(t) \\approx R_{on,0} + R_{ch,0} \\frac{\\Delta V_{th}(t)}{V_{ov,0}}$$\nThe detrapping of charge follows first-order kinetics, $dN_{it}/dt = - N_{it}/\\tau$, which has the solution $N_{it}(t) = N_{it}(0) \\exp(-t/\\tau)$. Since the threshold voltage shift is proportional to the trapped charge density, $\\Delta V_{th}(t) = \\gamma N_{it}(t)$, it also follows an exponential decay:\n$$\\Delta V_{th}(t) = \\Delta V_{th}(0) \\exp(-t/\\tau)$$\nwhere $\\Delta V_{th}(0)$ is the initial threshold voltage shift at $t=0^{+}$. Substituting this into the $R_{on}(t)$ expression, we obtain the final analytical model:\n$$R_{on}(t) \\approx R_{on,0} + \\left( R_{ch,0} \\frac{\\Delta V_{th}(0)}{V_{ov,0}} \\right) \\exp(-t/\\tau)$$\nThis equation can be written as $R_{on}(t) = R_{on,0} + \\Delta R_{on}(0) \\exp(-t/\\tau)$, where $\\Delta R_{on}(0) = R_{on}(0) - R_{on,0}$ is the initial excess on-resistance. This implies that the excess resistance $\\Delta R_{on}(t) = R_{on}(t) - R_{on,0}$ decays exponentially with time constant $\\tau$.\n\n**3. Calculation of the Time Constant $\\tau$**\n\nWe use the measured data to determine $\\tau$. The excess resistance is $\\Delta R_{on}(t) = R_{on}(t) - R_{on,0}$.\nUsing $R_{on,0} = 40\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega$:\n- At $t_1 = 0.5\\ \\mu\\mathrm{s}$, $R_{on}(t_1) = 60\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega$. The excess resistance is $\\Delta R_{on}(t_1) = 60\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega - 40\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega = 20\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega$.\n- At $t_2 = 5\\ \\mu\\mathrm{s}$, $R_{on}(t_2) = 48\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega$. The excess resistance is $\\Delta R_{on}(t_2) = 48\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega - 40\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega = 8\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega$.\n\nWe have the following system of equations from the model $\\Delta R_{on}(t) = \\Delta R_{on}(0) \\exp(-t/\\tau)$, where $t$ is in microseconds ($\\mu\\mathrm{s}$):\n$$20\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega = \\Delta R_{on}(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0.5}{\\tau}\\right)$$\n$$8\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega = \\Delta R_{on}(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{5}{\\tau}\\right)$$\nTo solve for $\\tau$, we divide the first equation by the second:\n$$\\frac{20}{8} = \\frac{\\Delta R_{on}(0) \\exp(-0.5/\\tau)}{\\Delta R_{on}(0) \\exp(-5/\\tau)}$$\n$$2.5 = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0.5}{\\tau} - \\left(-\\frac{5}{\\tau}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$2.5 = \\exp\\left(\\frac{4.5}{\\tau}\\right)$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln(2.5) = \\frac{4.5}{\\tau}$$\nSolving for $\\tau$:\n$$\\tau = \\frac{4.5}{\\ln(2.5)}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\\tau \\approx \\frac{4.5}{0.91629} \\approx 4.91114\\ \\mu\\mathrm{s}$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures as required, we get:\n$$\\tau \\approx 4.91\\ \\mu\\mathrm{s}$$\nThe time constant is expressed in microseconds.

During on-time, with input $P_{p}$, the state evolves to\n$$\n\\theta_{n}^{(+)} = s_{n} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{on}}}{\\tau_{i}}\\right) + P_{p} R_{i}\\left(1 - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{on}}}{\\tau_{i}}\\right)\\right).\n$$\nDuring off-time (input $0$), it decays to the start of the next cycle:\n$$\ns_{n+1} = \\theta_{n}^{(+)} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{T - T_{\\mathrm{on}}}{\\tau_{i}}\\right).\n$$\nIn steady-state, $s_{n+1} = s_{n} = s^{*}$, so\n$$\ns^{*} = \\left[s^{*} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{on}}}{\\tau_{i}}\\right) + P_{p} R_{i}\\left(1 - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{on}}}{\\tau_{i}}\\right)\\right)\\right] \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{T - T_{\\mathrm{on}}}{\\tau_{i}}\\right).\n$$\nSolving for $s^{*}$ and substituting into $\\theta^{(+)}$ yields the steady-state peak for element $i$ at the end of the on-time:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{peak},i} = P_{p} R_{i} \\frac{1 - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{on}}}{\\tau_{i}}\\right)}{1 - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{T}{\\tau_{i}}\\right)}.\n$$\nTherefore, the total periodic-pulse contribution at junction-to-case is\n$$\n\\Delta T_{jc}^{(\\mathrm{pulse})} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} P_{p} R_{i} \\frac{1 - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{on}}}{\\tau_{i}}\\right)}{1 - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{T}{\\tau_{i}}\\right)}.\n$$\n\nThird, for the case-to-sink and sink-to-ambient path, we adopt the stated approximation that their temperature rise follows the average power over one period, due to dominant large thermal capacitances. The average power is\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{avg}} = P_{b} + P_{p} D = 10 + 200 \\times 0.10 = 30 \\ \\mathrm{W}.\n$$\nThus the temperature rise across these resistances is\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{cs+sa}} = (R_{\\mathrm{cs}} + R_{\\mathrm{sa}}) P_{\\mathrm{avg}} = (0.05 + 0.30) \\times 30 = 0.35 \\times 30 = 10.5 \\ \\mathrm{K}.\n$$\n\nThe steady-state peak junction temperature at the end of the on-pulse is the sum of ambient plus all rises:\n$$\nT_{j,\\mathrm{peak}} = T_{a} + \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{cs+sa}} + \\Delta T_{jc}^{(b)} + \\Delta T_{jc}^{(\\mathrm{pulse})}.\n$$\n\nWe now compute $\\Delta T_{jc}^{(\\mathrm{pulse})}$ numerically for each $\\{R_{i}, \\tau_{i}\\}$:\n\n- For $i=1$: $\\tau_{1} = 0.01 \\ \\mathrm{s}$,\n$$\n\\frac{1 - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{on}}}{\\tau_{1}}\\right)}{1 - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{T}{\\tau_{1}}\\right)} = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-2)}{1 - \\exp(-20)} \\approx \\frac{0.8646647168}{0.9999999980} \\approx 0.864664718,\n$$\nso\n$$\n\\Delta T_{jc,1}^{(\\mathrm{pulse})} = P_{p} R_{1} \\times 0.864664718 = 200 \\times 0.02 \\times 0.864664718 \\approx 3.458658872 \\ \\mathrm{K}.\n$$\n\n- For $i=2$: $\\tau_{2} = 0.10 \\ \\mathrm{s}$,\n$$\n\\frac{1 - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{on}}}{\\tau_{2}}\\right)}{1 - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{T}{\\tau_{2}}\\right)} = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-0.2)}{1 - \\exp(-2)} \\approx \\frac{0.1812692469}{0.8646647168} \\approx 0.20964,\n$$\nso\n$$\n\\Delta T_{jc,2}^{(\\mathrm{pulse})} = 200 \\times 0.05 \\times 0.20964 \\approx 2.0964 \\ \\mathrm{K}.\n$$\n\n- For $i=3$: $\\tau_{3} = 1.20 \\ \\mathrm{s}$,\n$$\n\\frac{1 - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{on}}}{\\tau_{3}}\\right)}{1 - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{T}{\\tau_{3}}\\right)} = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-0.0166666667)}{1 - \\exp(-0.1666666667)} \\approx \\frac{0.0165285462}{0.1535182751} \\approx 0.107665,\n$$\nso\n$$\n\\Delta T_{jc,3}^{(\\mathrm{pulse})} = 200 \\times 0.08 \\times 0.107665 \\approx 1.72264 \\ \\mathrm{K}.\n$$\n\nSumming,\n$$\n\\Delta T_{jc}^{(\\mathrm{pulse})} \\approx 3.458658872 + 2.0964 + 1.72264 \\approx 7.27770 \\ \\mathrm{K}.\n$$\n\nCollecting all terms,\n$$\nT_{j,\\mathrm{peak}} = T_{a} + \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{cs+sa}} + \\Delta T_{jc}^{(b)} + \\Delta T_{jc}^{(\\mathrm{pulse})}\n= 40 + 10.5 + 1.5 + 7.27770 \\approx 59.27770^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}.\n$$\n\nRounded to four significant figures, the peak junction temperature is $59.28^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n\nAssessment against maximum rating:\n$$\nT_{j,\\mathrm{peak}} \\approx 59.28^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad T_{j,\\max} = 175^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C},\n$$\nso the condition complies with the maximum junction temperature rating, with a substantial thermal margin.",
