It presents a standard characterization scenario for a Silicon Carbide (SiC) MOSFET body diode, providing a mathematical model for the reverse recovery current and asking for the calculation of derivative parameters. The information provided is self-contained and sufficient for a unique solution. The presence of the commutating current slew rate, while not used in the final calculation, provides context for the measurement conditions and does not contradict the provided current model.\n\nThe problem asks for the computation of two quantities related to the reverse recovery of a SiC MOSFET's body diode: the total reverse recovery charge, $Q_{rr}$, and the peak reverse current, $I_{\\text{peak}}$. The reverse current, $i_{R}(t)$, for time $t \\ge 0$ is given by the function:\n$$\ni_{R}(t) = I_{0}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)\n$$\nThe parameters for this model are provided as $I_{0} = 22.5\\,\\text{A}$ and $\\tau = 60\\,\\text{ns}$. The time $t=0$ corresponds to the moment the reverse current reaches its peak value.\n\nFirst, we determine the peak reverse current, $I_{\\text{peak}}$. The peak reverse current is defined as the maximum value of the reverse current magnitude. The given function $i_{R}(t)$ is a monotonically decreasing function for $t \\ge 0$, as both $I_{0}$ and $\\tau$ are positive constants. The maximum value of a monotonically decreasing function on an interval $[0, \\infty)$ occurs at the beginning of the interval, i.e., at $t=0$.\n\nTherefore, the peak reverse current is:\n$$\nI_{\\text{peak}} = \\max_{t \\ge 0} \\{i_{R}(t)\\} = i_{R}(0)\n$$\nSubstituting $t=0$ into the equation for $i_{R}(t)$:\n$$\nI_{\\text{peak}} = I_{0}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{0}{\\tau}\\right) = I_{0}\\exp(0) = I_{0} \\times 1 = I_{0}\n$$\nUsing the given value $I_{0} = 22.5\\,\\text{A}$:\n$$\nI_{\\text{peak}} = 22.5\\,\\text{A}\n$$\nThis value is already given to three significant figures.\n\nNext, we compute the total reverse recovery charge, $Q_{rr}$. The fundamental relationship between charge, $Q$, and current, $i(t)$, is given by the integral of the current over time:\n$$\nQ = \\int i(t) \\,dt\n$$\nThe total reverse recovery charge, $Q_{rr}$, is the total charge that flows during the reverse recovery event. Based on the provided model, this corresponds to integrating the reverse current $i_{R}(t)$ from $t=0$ until the current decays to zero, which mathematically corresponds to the limit $t \\to \\infty$.\n\nThus, the integral for $Q_{rr}$ is:\n$$\nQ_{rr} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} i_{R}(t) \\,dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} I_{0}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) \\,dt\n$$\nWe can factor out the constant $I_{0}$ and perform the integration:\n$$\nQ_{rr} = I_{0} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) \\,dt\n$$\nThe antiderivative of $\\exp(-t/\\tau)$ with respect to $t$ is $-\\tau\\exp(-t/\\tau)$. Evaluating the definite integral:\n$$\nQ_{rr} = I_{0} \\left[ -\\tau\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty}\n$$\nNow, we evaluate the expression at the limits of integration:\n$$\nQ_{rr} = I_{0} \\left( \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\left[-\\tau\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)\\right] - \\left[-\\tau\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{0}{\\tau}\\right)\\right] \\right)\n$$\nAs $t \\to \\infty$, the term $\\exp(-t/\\tau)$ approaches $0$.
