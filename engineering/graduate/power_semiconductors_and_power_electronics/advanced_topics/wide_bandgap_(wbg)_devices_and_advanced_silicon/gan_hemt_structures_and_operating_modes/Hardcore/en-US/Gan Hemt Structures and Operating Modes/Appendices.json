It provides a clear, self-contained set of assumptions and data sufficient for a unique solution based on fundamental principles of electrostatics as applied to semiconductor devices. The problem is a standard exercise in solid-state device physics and is free of any invalidating flaws.\n\nThe goal is to determine the gate voltage relative to the Two-Dimensional Electron Gas (2DEG) potential, $V_{GS}$, required to fully deplete the 2DEG in a Gallium Nitride High Electron Mobility Transistor (GaN HEMT). We begin the derivation from Maxwell's equations, specifically Gauss's law for electrostatics.\n\nLet's model the gate-AlGaN-2DEG structure as a one-dimensional parallel-plate capacitor. We define a coordinate system with the $z$-axis perpendicular to the device layers, where $z=0$ is the metal gate/AlGaN interface and $z=t$ is the AlGaN/GaN interface where the 2DEG is located. The AlGaN barrier has a thickness $t$ and a relative permittivity $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{AlGaN}}$. The gate is at potential $V_G$ and the 2DEG is at potential $V_{2DEG}$. The gate voltage relative to the 2DEG is $V_{GS} = V_G - V_{2DEG}$.\n\nAccording to the problem, we assume a uniform electric field $E_z$ within the AlGaN barrier ($0  z  t$). The relationship between the potential difference and this uniform electric field is given by:\n$$ V_G - V_{2DEG} = - \\int_{t}^{0} E_z \\, dz $$\n$$ V_{GS} = -E_z (0 - t) = E_z t $$\nThus, the electric field in the barrier is directly proportional to the gate-to-channel voltage:\n$$ E_z = \\frac{V_{GS}}{t} $$\n\nNext, we establish the charge control model for the HEMT. The sheet density of electrons under the gate, $n_{s,g}$, is modulated by the gate voltage $V_{GS}$. The total sheet charge density in the semiconductor under the gate is the sum of the charge from the 2DEG electrons and any other charges. Since the problem instructs us to neglect all other charges, the semiconductor sheet charge density is $q_{s,g} = -e n_{s,g}$, where $e$ is the elementary charge.\n\nThe change in the semiconductor sheet charge, $\\Delta q_{s,g}$, is induced by the gate voltage and is equal and opposite to the charge accumulated on the gate metal, $\\sigma_G$.\n$$ \\Delta q_{s,g} = -\\sigma_G $$\nThe charge on the gate is given by the capacitor relation $\\sigma_G = C_{ox} V_{GS}$, where $C_{ox}$ is the capacitance per unit area of the AlGaN barrier.\n$$ C_{ox} = \\frac{\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{AlGaN}} \\epsilon_0}{t} $$\nwhere $\\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity.\nTherefore, the change in the 2DEG sheet charge density is:\n$$ \\Delta q_{s,g} = -C_{ox} V_{GS} = -\\frac{\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{AlGaN}} \\epsilon_0}{t} V_{GS} $$\nThe total 2DEG sheet charge density under the gate is the sum of its value at zero gate bias and the change induced by the gate voltage:\n$$ q_{s,g}(V_{GS}) = q_{s,g}(0) + \\Delta q_{s,g} $$\nThe problem states to neglect built-in potentials. Under this simplifying assumption, the 2DEG sheet density at zero bias, $n_{s,g}(0)$, is the equilibrium density, $n_s$. Thus, the sheet charge density at zero bias is $q_{s,g}(0) = -e n_s$.\nSubstituting this into the equation for $q_{s,g}(V_{GS})$, we obtain the required relation between the gate voltage and the 2DEG sheet charge:\n$$ q_{s,g}(V_{GS}) = -e n_s - \\frac{\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{AlGaN}} \\epsilon_0}{t} V_{GS} $$\nThis linear equation is the charge control model for the HEMT under the specified approximations.\n\nFull depletion of the 2DEG under the gate occurs when the electron sheet density $n_{s,g}$ becomes zero. This is equivalent to the sheet charge density $q_{s,g}$ becoming zero. The gate voltage at which this occurs is defined as the threshold voltage, $V_{th}$. We set $q_{s,g}(V_{th}) = 0$:\n$$ 0 = -e n_s - \\frac{\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{AlGaN}} \\epsilon_0}{t} V_{th} $$\nSolving for $V_{th}$, we get:\n$$ \\frac{\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{AlGaN}} \\epsilon_0}{t} V_{th} = -e n_s $$\n$$ V_{th} = -\\frac{e n_s t}{\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{AlGaN}} \\epsilon_0} $$\nThis expression gives the gate bias relative to the 2DEG potential required to fully deplete the channel. The negative sign indicates that a negative gate voltage is required to repel the electrons, which is physically correct for a normally-on n-channel device.\n\nWe can now substitute the given numerical values to estimate the threshold voltage.\nThe provided data are:\n- AlGaN barrier thickness: $t = 22\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 22 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- 2DEG sheet density: $n_s = 1.1 \\times 10^{13}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2} = 1.1 \\times 10^{17}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$\n- Relative permittivity of AlGaN: $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{AlGaN}} = 8.5$\n\nThe physical constants are:\n- Elementary charge: $e \\approx 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n- Vacuum permittivity: $\\epsilon_0 \\approx 8.854 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}$\n\nNow, we calculate $V_{th}$:\n$$ V_{th} = -\\frac{(1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}) (1.1 \\times 10^{17}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}) (22 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m})}{(8.5) (8.854 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F/m})} $$\n$$ V_{th} = -\\frac{1.602 \\times 1.1 \\times 22 \\times 10^{-19+17-9}}{8.5 \\times 8.854 \\times 10^{-12}} \\, \\mathrm{V} $$\n$$ V_{th} = -\\frac{38.7684 \\times 10^{-11}}{75.259 \\times 10^{-12}} \\, \\mathrm{V} $$\n$$ V_{th} = -\\frac{3.87684 \\times 10^{-10}}{7.5259 \\times 10^{-11}} \\, \\mathrm{V} $$\n$$ V_{th} \\approx -5.15119\\,\\mathrm{V} $$\nRounding the result to three significant figures as requested, we get:\n$$ V_{th} \\approx -5.15\\,\\mathrm{V} $$",

Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to determine the fractional increase in the channel on-resistance, $R_{on}$, of a GaN HEMT when the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) sheet density, $n_s$, is reduced.\n\nWe begin with the fundamental drift-current relationship. In a three-dimensional conductor, the current density $J$ is given by $J = \\sigma E$, where $\\sigma$ is the conductivity and $E$ is the electric field. The conductivity can be expressed as $\\sigma = q n \\mu$, where $q$ is the elementary charge, $n$ is the free carrier volume density, and $\\mu$ is the carrier mobility.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis begins with the fundamental definition of electric current. The drift current is the net flow of charge carriers under the influence of an electric field. In a three-dimensional conductor of cross-sectional area $A$, the current $I$ is given by $I = n \\cdot q \\cdot v_d \\cdot A$, where $n$ is the volume carrier density, $q$ is the elementary charge, and $v_d$ is the carrier drift velocity.\n\nIn a High Electron Mobility Transistor (HEMT), the charge carriers (electrons) are confined to a very thin layer at the heterointerface, forming a Two-Dimensional Electron Gas (2DEG). It is more appropriate to work with quantities defined per unit width of the device channel.\n\nLet $W$ be the width of the HEMT channel. The total charge in the 2DEG is characterized by the sheet electron density, $n_s$, which has units of electrons per unit area (e.g., $\\text{cm}^{-2}$).\n\nThe total number of electrons in a channel segment of length $L$ and width $W$ is $N_{e} = n_s \\cdot L \\cdot W$.\nThe total charge in this segment is $Q = N_{e} \\cdot q = n_s \\cdot q \\cdot L \\cdot W$.\n\nThe time $\\Delta t$ required for these electrons to transit the length $L$ at a drift velocity $v_d$ is $\\Delta t = \\frac{L}{v_d}$.\n\nThe total current $I$ flowing through the channel is the total charge $Q$ passing through a cross-section per unit time. Using the transit time, this can be expressed as:\n$$I = \\frac{Q}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{n_s \\cdot q \\cdot L \\cdot W}{L / v_d} = n_s \\cdot q \\cdot v_d \\cdot W$$\n\nThe problem asks for the current per unit width, which we denote as $I_W$. This is obtained by dividing the total current $I$ by the device width $W$:\n$$I_W = \\frac{I}{W} = n_s \\cdot q \\cdot v_d$$\n\nCurrent saturation occurs when the current ceases to increase significantly with a further increase in the longitudinal electric field (i.e., drain-source voltage). In short-channel or high-mobility devices like GaN HEMTs, this is primarily caused by the electron drift velocity reaching its physical limit, the saturation velocity $v_{\\text{sat}}$. This limit arises from strong scattering with optical phonons at high electric fields.\n\nBy substituting $v_d = v_{\\text{sat}}$ into the expression for $I_W$, we obtain the expression for the saturation current per unit width, $I_{W, \\text{sat}}$:\n$$I_{W, \\text{sat}} = n_s \\cdot q \\cdot v_{\\text{sat}}$$\nThis is the required derived expression.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the provided data:\n$n_{s} = 1.0 \\times 10^{13} \\ \\text{cm}^{-2}$\n$q = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\text{C}$\n$v_{\\text{sat}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{7} \\ \\text{cm/s}$\n\n$$I_{W, \\text{sat}} = (1.0 \\times 10^{13} \\ \\text{cm}^{-2}) \\times (1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\text{C}) \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{7} \\ \\text{cm/s})$$\n$$I_{W, \\text{sat}} = (1.0 \\times 1.602 \\times 2.0) \\times 10^{(13 - 19 + 7)} \\ \\frac{\\text{C}}{\\text{cm} \\cdot \\text{s}}$$\n$$I_{W, \\text{sat}} = 3.204 \\times 10^{1} \\ \\frac{\\text{A}}{\\text{cm}}$$\nSince $1 \\ \\text{A} = 1 \\ \\text{C/s}$. The result is in units of Amperes per centimeter.\n\nThe problem requires the answer in Amperes per millimeter ($\\text{A/mm}$). We perform the unit conversion:\n$$1 \\ \\text{cm} = 10 \\ \\text{mm}$$\n$$I_{W, \\text{sat}} = 3.204 \\times 10^1 \\ \\frac{\\text{A}}{\\text{cm}} \\times \\frac{1 \\ \\text{cm}}{10 \\ \\text{mm}} = 3.204 \\ \\frac{\\text{A}}{\\text{mm}}$$\n\nRounding to three significant figures, the value is $3.20 \\ \\text{A/mm}$.\n\n### Assessment of Saturation Mechanism\n\nThe question requires an assessment of whether velocity saturation or channel pinch-off is expected to dominate current saturation in a GaN HEMT.\n\nIn the classical model of a long-channel MOSFET, current saturation is described by channel \"pinch-off\". As the drain-source voltage $V_{DS}$ increases, the potential along the channel $V(x)$ increases from $0$ at the source to $V_{DS}$ at the drain. The gate-to-channel voltage, $V_{GC}(x) = V_{GS} - V(x)$, which controls the channel charge density, therefore decreases towards the drain. Pinch-off occurs when $V_{GC}(x)$ at the drain end drops to the threshold voltage $V_{th}$, causing the inversion charge density to approach zero. Further increases in $V_{DS}$ are dropped across this depleted pinch-off region, and the current remains largely constant. This model implicitly assumes that the carrier velocity remains proportional to the local electric field ($v_d = \\mu E$).\n\nHowever, in devices with high carrier mobility and short channel lengths, such as modern GaN HEMTs, the longitudinal electric field can become very large even at moderate values of $V_{DS}$. For GaN, the critical electric field for the onset of velocity saturation is on the order of $10^4 - 10^5 \\ \\text{V/cm}$. With typical gate lengths $L_g$ less than a micrometer, this field can be reached at a $V_{DS}$ of only a few volts.\n\nThe calculation above, based on the assumption of velocity saturation, yields an ideal saturation current per unit width of $I_{W, \\text{sat}} \\approx 3.20 \\ \\text{A/mm}$. This is an extremely high value and is a direct consequence of the large product of sheet charge density and saturation velocity ($n_s \\cdot v_{\\text{sat}}$) characteristic of the AlGaN/GaN system.\n\nWhen a GaN HEMT operates at high $V_{DS}$, the following occurs:\n1. Electrons are accelerated by the high longitudinal electric field and quickly reach the saturation velocity $v_{\\text{sat}}$ near the drain side of the channel.\n2. Simultaneously, the increasing channel potential $V(x)$ reduces the local gate-to-channel voltage, which in turn reduces the 2DEG sheet density $n_s(x)$ below its equilibrium value.\n\nThe crucial point is which mechanism becomes the bottleneck first. In GaN HEMTs, the electric field necessary to cause velocity saturation is reached well before the local gate-to-channel voltage is sufficient to completely deplete the 2DEG (i.e., cause classical pinch-off). The charge density at the drain end is reduced, but it does not go to zero. The current becomes limited by the flux of a reduced number of carriers moving at the maximum possible speed ($v_{\\text{sat}}$). The current is then described by $I \\approx W \\cdot q \\cdot n_s(\\text{drain}) \\cdot v_{\\text{sat}}$.\n\nTherefore, **velocity saturation is the dominant physical mechanism that initiates current saturation in GaN HEMTs**. The traditional pinch-off model is insufficient because it neglects high-field effects on carrier velocity. The saturation characteristic of a GaN HEMT is more accurately a combination of velocity saturation and charge modulation (a \"soft\" pinch-off), but the onset of saturation is dictated by carriers reaching $v_{\\text{sat}}$. The computed high current density reinforces this point, as it shows the immense current-carrying potential that is ultimately limited by the finite drift velocity of electrons.",
