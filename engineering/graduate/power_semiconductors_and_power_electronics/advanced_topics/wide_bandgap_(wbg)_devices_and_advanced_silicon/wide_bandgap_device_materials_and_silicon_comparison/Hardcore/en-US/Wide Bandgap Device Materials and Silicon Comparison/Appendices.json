This exercise explores this fundamental benefit by tasking you with calculating the required drift region thickness for a specified high-voltage rating in both Silicon (Si) and Silicon Carbide (SiC) . By working through an idealized parallel-plate model, you will quantify the significant reduction in device thickness afforded by SiC's superior critical electric field, $E_{c}$, a cornerstone of its low on-resistance performance.",

Assume electrostatic conditions with full depletion in the drift region at breakdown and negligible space charge density so that the internal electric field is spatially uniform at the onset of avalanche breakdown.

This practice  asks you to calculate the minimal carrier transit time across a fixed-length drift region for Si, SiC, and Gallium Nitride (GaN), based on their respective saturated drift velocities, $v_{sat}$.

            "problem": "In high-field unipolar power devices such as Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFETs) and High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMT), carrier transport in the drift region is ultimately limited by the saturated drift velocity. Starting from the definition of drift velocity as kinematics, $v=dx/dt$, and the physical notion of saturated drift velocity $v_{\\mathrm{sat}}$ at high electric field, derive the minimal transit time for a carrier to traverse a uniform drift region of length $L$ when the local electric field is sufficiently high everywhere in the region to maintain velocity saturation.

            "solution": "The transit time, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{tr}}$, of a charge carrier across a region is the total time it takes for the carrier to traverse the length of that region. We begin with the fundamental kinematic definition of velocity, $v$, as the rate of change of position, $x$, with respect to time, $t$:\n$$\nv = \\frac{dx}{dt}\n$$\nThe problem states that the electric field is sufficiently high everywhere within the drift region to ensure that the carriers move at their saturated drift velocity, $v_{\\mathrm{sat}}$.

The carrier transit time across the drift region represents a fundamental delay in the operation of a unipolar power device. This delay is a major component of the total time required for the device to switch from its on-state to its off-state (or vice versa). A shorter transit time enables a faster switching action. The ultimate switching frequency of a device, often characterized by its cutoff frequency $f_T$, is inversely proportional to the total transit delay. A common approximation is $f_T \\approx (2\\pi\\tau_{\\mathrm{tr}})^{-1}$.\n\nOur calculations show that for the same drift region length $L=5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, the minimal transit time in SiC ($2.50 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\mathrm{s}$) is half that of Si ($5.00 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\mathrm{s}$), and the transit time in GaN ($2.00 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\mathrm{s}$) is even smaller, at $40\\%$ of the Si value. This is a direct consequence of the higher saturated drift velocities in SiC and GaN. Therefore, wide-bandgap semiconductor devices made from SiC and GaN possess a fundamental, material-based advantage over Si devices, allowing them to operate at significantly higher switching frequencies. This superior high-frequency performance is a primary reason for their adoption in advanced power electronics applications, such as high-frequency power converters and radio-frequency power amplifiers.",
