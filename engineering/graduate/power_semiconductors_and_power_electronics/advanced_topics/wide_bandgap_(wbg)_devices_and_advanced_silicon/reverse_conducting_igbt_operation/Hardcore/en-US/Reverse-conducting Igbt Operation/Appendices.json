In steady conduction at a target magnitude of current density $J$ (same magnitude in forward and reverse), the drift region is conductivity modulated by an approximately uniform excess carrier plasma.

            "solution": "### Physical Explanation of the Tail Current\nAn RC-IGBT integrates a freewheeling diode anti-parallel to the IGBT switch. During the diode's forward conduction phase (reverse current through the IGBT terminals), the lightly doped n-type drift region is flooded with a high density of electron-hole pairs, forming a charge-neutral plasma. This process, known as conductivity modulation, drastically reduces the on-state resistance and voltage drop of the diode.\n\nWhen the external circuit forces the current to commutate (i.e., turn off), the device must transition to a reverse-blocking state. This requires the removal of the vast amount of stored charge (the plasma) from the drift region. This removal occurs via two primary mechanisms:\n$1$. Carrier extraction by the reverse-biased junctions at the boundaries of the drift region.\n$2$. Carrier recombination within the bulk of the drift region.\n\nThe extraction process is relatively fast but cannot remove all the charge, especially from the center of the wide drift region. The remaining excess carriers must be removed by the slower process of recombination. As these carriers persist, they can still support a small, decaying current flow. This lingering current, which decays over a characteristic time, is observed as the \"tail current.\" Its duration is determined by the interplay between recombination lifetime and the time it takes for carriers to diffuse to the recombination-heavy boundaries, which is the subject of the following quantitative analysis.\n\n### Mathematical Derivation and Solution\n\nThe dynamics of excess carriers are governed by the continuity equations for electrons ($n$) and holes ($p$). For the excess carrier densities $\\Delta n = n - n_0$ and $\\Delta p = p - p_0$, these equations are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Delta n}{\\partial t} = \\frac{1}{q} \\nabla \\cdot \\vec{J}_n - R_{net}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Delta p}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{1}{q} \\nabla \\cdot \\vec{J}_p - R_{net}\n$$\nwhere $\\vec{J}_n$ and $\\vec{J}_p$ are the electron and hole current densities, $q$ is the elementary charge, and $R_{net}$ is the net recombination rate. Under the specified SRH recombination and high-level injection conditions, $R_{net} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta n}{\\tau}$, assuming $\\Delta n \\approx \\Delta p$.\n\nThe problem states to model this in one dimension, so $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{J}$ becomes $\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x}$. Since $\\Delta n(x,t) \\approx \\Delta p(x,t)$, their time derivatives are also equal. This implies $\\frac{1}{q} \\frac{\\partial J_n}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{1}{q} \\frac{\\partial J_p}{\\partial x}$, which means $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(J_n + J_p) = 0$. The total current density $J_{tot} = J_n + J_p$ is therefore constant in space. During the tail current phase, after the main current has been commutated, the total terminal current is negligible, so we can assume $J_{tot} \\approx 0$. This leads to the standard ambipolar diffusion model.\n\nIn this regime, the particle flow is driven by diffusion, and the governing equation for the excess carrier density $\\Delta n(x,t)$ reduces to the ambipolar diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Delta n}{\\partial t} = D_a \\frac{\\partial^2 \\Delta n}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{\\Delta n}{\\tau}\n$$\nHere, $D_a$ is the ambipolar diffusion coefficient. For high-level injection ($n \\approx p$), it is given by:\n$$\nD_a = \\frac{2 D_n D_p}{D_n + D_p}\n$$\nwhere $D_n$ and $D_p$ are the individual diffusion coefficients for electrons and holes. These are related to the mobilities $\\mu_n$ and $\\mu_p$ via the Einstein relation:\n$$\nD_n = \\frac{k_B T}{q} \\mu_n \\quad \\text{and} \\quad D_p = \\frac{k_B T}{q} \\mu_p\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{k_B T}{q}$ is the thermal voltage, denoted as $V_T$.\n\nWe solve the PDE using the method of separation of variables. Let $\\Delta n(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the PDE yields:\n$$\nX(x)\\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = D_a T(t)\\frac{d^2X(x)}{dx^2} - \\frac{X(x)T(t)}{\\tau}\n$$\nDividing by $X(x)T(t)$ separates the variables:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T(t)}\\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = \\frac{D_a}{X(x)}\\frac{d^2X(x)}{dx^2} - \\frac{1}{\\tau} = -\n\\lambda\n$$\nwhere $-\\lambda$ is the separation constant. The temporal part is $\\frac{dT}{dt} = -\\lambda T$, which has the solution $T(t) = C \\exp(-\\lambda t)$. The spatial part is:\n$$\nD_a \\frac{d^2X}{dx^2} + \\left(\\lambda - \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\right) X = 0\n$$\nThe boundary conditions are $\\Delta n(0, t) = 0$ and $\\Delta n(W, t) = 0$, which implies $X(0) = 0$ and $X(W) = 0$. The solutions to this spatial Sturm-Liouville problem are sinusoidal:\n$$\nX_m(x) = A_m \\sin(k_m x), \\quad \\text{where} \\quad k_m = \\frac{m\\pi}{W} \\quad \\text{for integer } m = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the spatial differential equation gives the allowed values for the separation constant $\\lambda_m$:\n$$\n-D_a k_m^2 + \\left(\\lambda_m - \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\right) = 0 \\implies \\lambda_m = \\frac{1}{\\tau} + D_a k_m^2 = \\frac{1}{\\tau} + D_a \\left(\\frac{m\\pi}{W}\\right)^2\n$$\nThe full solution is a superposition of all modes:\n$$\n\\Delta n(x,t) = \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} A_m \\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{W}\\right) \\exp(-\\lambda_m t)\n$$\nAt long times ($t \\to \\infty$), the sum is dominated by the term with the smallest decay rate $\\lambda_m$. The smallest $\\lambda_m$ corresponds to the smallest value of $m$, which is $m=1$. This is the fundamental or slowest decay mode. The time constant $\\tau_d$ of the tail current is the reciprocal of this slowest decay rate, $\\lambda_1$.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau_d} = \\lambda_1 = \\frac{1}{\\tau} + D_a \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{W}\\right)^2\n$$\nThus, the time constant is:\n$$\n\\tau_d = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\tau} + \\frac{D_a \\pi^2}{W^2} \\right)^{-1}\n$$\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nFirst, we calculate the thermal voltage $V_T$:\n$$\nV_T = \\frac{k_B T}{q} = \\frac{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{K})(300\\,\\mathrm{K})}{1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}} \\approx 0.025852\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the ambipolar diffusion coefficient $D_a$. It is more direct to use the mobility expression:\n$$\nD_a = V_T \\left( \\frac{2 \\mu_n \\mu_p}{\\mu_n + \\mu_p} \\right)\n= (0.025852\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\left( \\frac{2 (1350\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2/(\\mathrm{V}\\cdot\\mathrm{s})) (480\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2/(\\mathrm{V}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}))}{1350\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2/(\\mathrm{V}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}) + 480\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2/(\\mathrm{V}\\cdot\\mathrm{s})} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nD_a = (0.025852\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\left( \\frac{1296000}{1830} \\frac{\\mathrm{cm}^2}{\\mathrm{V}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}} \\right) \\approx (0.025852)(708.1967) \\,\\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{s} \\approx 18.3074\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the two components of the decay rate:\nThe recombination component is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau} = \\frac{1}{6.00 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}} = 166666.\\overline{6}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe diffusion component for the fundamental mode is:\n$$\n\\frac{D_a \\pi^2}{W^2} = \\frac{(18.3074\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{s}) \\pi^2}{(2.00 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{cm})^2} = \\frac{18.3074 \\times \\pi^2}{4.00 \\times 10^{-4}}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\approx 451734\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe total decay rate is the sum of these two rates:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau_d} = 166666.\\overline{6}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} + 451734\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\approx 618401\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nFinally, the time constant $\\tau_d$ is the reciprocal of this rate:\n$$\n\\tau_d = \\frac{1}{618401\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \\approx 1.61707 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the answer in microseconds, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\tau_d \\approx 1.617\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}\n$$",
