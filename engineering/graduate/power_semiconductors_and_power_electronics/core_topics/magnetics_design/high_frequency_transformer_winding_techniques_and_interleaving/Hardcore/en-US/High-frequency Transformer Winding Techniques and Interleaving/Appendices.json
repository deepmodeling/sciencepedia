The final numeric answer must be only the frequency $f^{\\star}$.",
            "solution": "**Part 1: Calculation of Frequency $f^{\\star}$**\n\nThe skin depth, $\\delta$, is the characteristic depth at which the current density in a conductor, due to an alternating current, decays to $1/e$ of its value at the surface. This phenomenon arises from induced eddy currents that oppose the primary current flow in the conductor's interior. The standard expression for skin depth as a function of angular frequency $\\omega = 2\\pi f$, electrical resistivity $\\rho$, and magnetic permeability $\\mu$ is derived from the diffusion equation for electromagnetic fields in a good conductor:\n$$\n\\delta = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\rho}{\\omega\\mu}}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\omega = 2\\pi f$, the expression in terms of frequency $f$ is:\n$$\n\\delta = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\rho}{2\\pi f \\mu}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho}{\\pi f \\mu}}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the criterion for determining the frequency of interest, $f^{\\star}$, as the point where the foil thickness $t$ is equal to twice the skin depth:\n$$\nt = 2\\delta\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\delta$ into this criterion gives:\n$$\nt = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho}{\\pi f^{\\star} \\mu}}\n$$\nTo solve for $f^{\\star}$, we first isolate the square root term and then square both sides of the equation:\n$$\n\\frac{t}{2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho}{\\pi f^{\\star} \\mu}}\n$$\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{t}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\rho}{\\pi f^{\\star} \\mu}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{t^2}{4} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\pi f^{\\star} \\mu}\n$$\nFinally, we rearrange the equation to express $f^{\\star}$ in terms of the given parameters $t$, $\\rho$, and $\\mu$:\n$$\nf^{\\star} = \\frac{4\\rho}{\\pi \\mu t^2}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values.

Rounding to three significant figures, we get $f^{\\star} = 4.55\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$.\n\n**Part 2: Practical Significance of the Criterion $t = 2\\delta$**\n\nThe criterion $t = 2\\delta$ is a fundamental rule of thumb in the design of high-frequency transformers and inductors. Its significance is rooted in the trade-off between conductor utilization and AC power loss, which is dominated by two phenomena derived from Faraday's Law of Induction: the skin effect and the proximity effect.\n\n1.  **Skin Effect and Proximity Effect**:\n    - **Skin Effect**: This is an intra-conductor phenomenon. An alternating current flowing through a conductor generates a time-varying magnetic field within it. This field, by Faraday's law, induces eddy currents that flow in opposition to the main current at the conductor's center and in sympathy with it at the surface. The net result is that current density is highest at the surface and decays exponentially toward the center. The skin depth, $\\delta$, quantifies this decay. For a conductor thickness $t > \\delta$, the central copper is underutilized, increasing the effective AC resistance ($R_{AC}$) compared to its DC resistance ($R_{DC}$).\n    - **Proximity Effect**: This is an inter-conductor phenomenon. In a transformer winding, the magnetic field from adjacent conductors (or layers) also induces eddy currents. In a typical layered winding, the magnetomotive force (MMF) distribution creates a strong magnetic field perpendicular to the flat face of the foil conductors. These externally generated fields induce large circulating eddy currents that dramatically increase power loss. Proximity effect losses are often far more severe than skin effect losses in multi-layer windings.\n\n2.  **Significance of $t = 2\\delta$ and Winding Selection**:\n    The ratio of AC resistance to DC resistance, $F_R = R_{AC}/R_{DC}$, for a foil winding can be calculated using Dowell's equations. These equations show that $F_R$ is a strong function of the normalized thickness $\\xi = t/\\delta$ and the number of winding layers, $p$.\n    - For $\\xi \\ll 1$ (very thin conductor), $R_{AC} \\approx R_{DC}$.\n    - As $\\xi$ increases, $R_{AC}$ increases. The criterion $t = 2\\delta$, which corresponds to $\\xi = 2$, marks a practical \"knee\" in the loss curve. Beyond this point, $R_{AC}$ escalates rapidly, especially for multi-layer windings where proximity effects dominate. Making a conductor thicker than $2\\delta$ adds copper that not only fails to carry significant current but also actively generates substantial additional eddy current loss.\n    - **Winding Technique Selection**:\n        - **Single Foil ($t \\le 2\\delta$)**: If the required cross-section for the winding can be achieved with a foil thickness $t$ that is near or below $2\\delta$ at the operating frequency, a single foil is often optimal. It offers a superior copper-area fill factor and is simple to manufacture.\n        - **Parallel Thin Foils ($t > 2\\delta$)**: If the design requires a total conductor thickness greater than $2\\delta$, using a single thick foil is highly inefficient. The solution is to divide the conductor into multiple, parallel-connected thin foils, each with a thickness $t_{foil}  \\delta$. This keeps the internal skin effect for each foil low.\n        - **Litz Wire ($t \\gg 2\\delta$)**: For very high frequencies where even thin foils are problematic, or for non-planar geometries, Litz wire is used. It comprises many individually insulated strands, each with a diameter less than $2\\delta$, woven together. The weave ensures each strand transposes through every position in the bundle, equalizing flux linkage and forcing equal current sharing, thereby defeating both skin and proximity effects.\n\n3.  **Role of Interleaving: Leakage Inductance and AC Loss Trade-off**:\n    Interleaving is a winding arrangement technique where primary (P) and secondary (S) layers are alternated (e.g., a simple PPSS winding is changed to PSPS).\n    - **Effect on Leakage Inductance**: Leakage inductance is proportional to the magnetic energy stored in the winding window that does not link both primary and secondary. In a non-interleaved winding, the primary and secondary current centroids are far apart, resulting in a large volume of high MMF and thus high stored energy and high leakage inductance. Interleaving brings the primary and secondary currents into close proximity, which drastically reduces the net MMF in the window, reduces the stored energy, and therefore **significantly reduces leakage inductance**.\n    - **Effect on AC Losses (Proximity Effect)**: Proximity effect losses are proportional to the square of the magnetic field amplitude perpendicular to the conductor surface. The MMF profile of a non-interleaved winding is a single large triangle, meaning layers in the center experience a very high magnetic field. Interleaving breaks this large MMF triangle into multiple, smaller triangles. This **lowers the peak magnetic field** that any winding layer is exposed to. As losses scale with the field squared, this leads to a dramatic **reduction in proximity effect losses**.\n    - **The \"Trade-off\"**: Interleaving provides a dual benefit: it concurrently reduces both leakage inductance and AC winding losses. The primary trade-off is not an electromagnetic one but one of manufacturing complexity and cost. Increased interleaving (e.g., from PSPS to PSPspS, where 'p' and 's' are half-windings) further improves performance but adds more connections and winding steps. An additional consideration is the increased inter-winding capacitance, which can be a concern for EMI and common-mode noise. The choice of foil thickness based on the $t=2\\delta$ criterion remains a prerequisite for an efficient design, even when interleaving is employed. Interleaving manages the external field environment, while keeping $t \\le 2\\delta$ manages the conductor's internal response to that field.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of snubber power dissipation in a flyback converter under two different transformer winding configurations.

Given $\\delta = 0.05 > 0$, the difference is positive, so $|2 \\delta C_b| = 2 \\delta C_b$.\n\nNow, we form the ratio $R$:\n$$ R = \\frac{2 \\delta C_b}{C_0(1-\\beta)} $$\nWe are given the following values:\n$C_0 = 140 \\text{ pF}$\n$\\beta = 0.3$\n$C_b = 60 \\text{ pF}$\n$\\delta = 0.05$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $R$:\n$$ R = \\frac{2 \\times 0.05 \\times 60}{140 \\times (1 - 0.3)} $$\n$$ R = \\frac{0.1 \\times 60}{140 \\times 0.7} = \\frac{6}{98} = \\frac{3}{49} $$\nTo provide the answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures, we compute the value of the fraction:\n$$ R = \\frac{3}{49} \\approx 0.061224489... $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$ R \\approx 0.06122 $$\nThis result signifies that the balanced winding arrangement reduces the amplitude of the common-mode noise source by a factor of approximately $0.06122$, which corresponds to a reduction of over $93\\%$.",
