Faraday's Law of Induction: $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}$\n2. Ampere-Maxwell Law: $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{J} + \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{D}}{\\partial t}$\n\nUsing the constitutive relations $\\mathbf{D} = \\epsilon \\mathbf{E}$, $\\mathbf{B} = \\mu \\mathbf{H}$, and $\\mathbf{J} = \\sigma \\mathbf{E}$, Ampere's law becomes:\n$\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu \\sigma \\mathbf{E} + \\mu \\epsilon \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t}$\n\nFor a time-harmonic field with angular frequency $\\omega = 2\\pi f$, we use phasor notation where $\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r}, t) = \\text{Re}\\{\\tilde{\\mathbf{E}}(\\mathbf{r}) e^{j\\omega t}\\}$ and the time derivative $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ is replaced by $j\\omega$. The phasor forms of the equations are:\n$\\nabla \\times \\tilde{\\mathbf{E}} = -j\\omega \\tilde{\\mathbf{B}}$\n$\\nabla \\times \\tilde{\\mathbf{B}} = (\\mu \\sigma + j\\omega \\mu \\epsilon) \\tilde{\\mathbf{E}}$\n\nTo obtain a wave equation for the electric field, we take the curl of Faraday's law:\n$\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\tilde{\\mathbf{E}}) = -j\\omega (\\nabla \\times \\tilde{\\mathbf{B}})$\nUsing the vector identity $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{V}) = \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{V}) - \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{V}$ and noting that from Gauss's Law $\\nabla \\cdot \\tilde{\\mathbf{D}} = 0$, we have $\\nabla \\cdot \\tilde{\\mathbf{E}} = 0$, the identity simplifies to $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\tilde{\\mathbf{E}}) = -\\nabla^2 \\tilde{\\mathbf{E}}$.\nSubstituting this and the phasor form of Ampere's law gives:\n$-\\nabla^2 \\tilde{\\mathbf{E}} = -j\\omega (\\mu \\sigma + j\\omega \\mu \\epsilon) \\tilde{\\mathbf{E}}$\n$\\nabla^2 \\tilde{\\mathbf{E}} = (j\\omega \\mu \\sigma - \\omega^2 \\mu \\epsilon) \\tilde{\\mathbf{E}}$\n\nThis is the vector Helmholtz equation, $\\nabla^2 \\tilde{\\mathbf{E}} - \\gamma^2 \\tilde{\\mathbf{E}} = 0$, where $\\gamma^2 = j\\omega \\mu \\sigma - \\omega^2 \\mu \\epsilon = j\\omega \\mu (\\sigma + j\\omega \\epsilon)$. The term $\\gamma$ is the complex propagation constant.\n\nFor a good conductor, the conduction current density is much greater than the displacement current density, i.e., $|\\sigma \\tilde{\\mathbf{E}}| \\gg |\\omega \\epsilon \\tilde{\\mathbf{E}}|$, or $\\sigma \\gg \\omega \\epsilon$. Let us verify this condition.\n$\\omega = 2\\pi f = 2\\pi (1 \\times 10^5\\,\\text{Hz}) \\approx 6.283 \\times 10^5\\,\\text{rad/s}$.\nThe permittivity of copper is approximately that of free space, $\\epsilon \\approx \\epsilon_0 = 8.854 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{F/m}$.\n$\\omega \\epsilon \\approx (6.283 \\times 10^5) (8.854 \\times 10^{-12}) \\approx 5.56 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{S/m}$.\nSince $\\sigma = 5.8 \\times 10^7\\,\\text{S/m}$, the condition $\\sigma \\gg \\omega \\epsilon$ is satisfied by many orders of magnitude. The good conductor approximation is therefore highly accurate.\n\nUnder this approximation, $\\gamma^2 \\approx j\\omega \\mu \\sigma$.\nThe propagation constant is $\\gamma = \\sqrt{j\\omega\\mu\\sigma}$. We express the complex number $j$ in polar form as $e^{j\\pi/2}$.\n$\\sqrt{j} = (e^{j\\pi/2})^{1/2} = e^{j\\pi/4} = \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{4}) + j\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + j\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1+j}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\nThus, $\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\omega\\mu\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{1+j}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega\\mu\\sigma}{2}} + j\\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega\\mu\\sigma}{2}}$.\nThe propagation constant has the form $\\gamma = \\alpha + j\\beta$, where $\\alpha$ is the attenuation constant and $\\beta$ is the phase constant.\n$\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega\\mu\\sigma}{2}}$.\nA plane wave propagating in the $z$-direction has its amplitude decay as $e^{-\\alpha z}$. The skin depth, $\\delta$, is defined as the distance over which the field amplitude decays to $1/e$ of its value at the surface. This implies $\\alpha \\delta = 1$.\n$\\delta = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\omega\\mu\\sigma}}$.\nSubstituting $\\omega = 2\\pi f$, we obtain the final expression for the skin depth:\n$\\delta = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{2\\pi f \\mu \\sigma}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\pi f \\mu \\sigma}}$.\n\n**Numerical Calculation of $\\delta$**\n\nUsing the given parameter values:\n$f = 1 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\text{Hz}$\n$\\mu = \\mu_0 = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{H/m}$\n$\\sigma = 5.8 \\times 10^7\\,\\text{S/m}$\n\n$\\delta = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\pi (1 \\times 10^5) (4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}) (5.8 \\times 10^7)}}$\n$\\delta = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4\\pi^2 \\times 5.8 \\times 10^5}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4(9.8696)(5.8 \\times 10^5)}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2.2893 \\times 10^7}}$\n$\\delta \\approx \\sqrt{4.368 \\times 10^{-8}}\\,\\text{m} \\approx 2.090 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{m}$.\nTo express this in millimeters, we multiply by $10^3$:\n$\\delta \\approx 0.2090\\,\\text{mm}$.\n\n**Calculation of Skin-Effect Parameter $p$ and Regime Analysis**\n\nThe dimensionless skin-effect parameter $p$ is the ratio of the conductor radius $a$ to the skin depth $\\delta$:\n$p = \\frac{a}{\\delta}$\nUsing the given radius $a = 0.4\\,\\text{mm}$ and our calculated skin depth $\\delta \\approx 0.2090\\,\\text{mm}$:\n$p = \\frac{0.4}{0.2090} \\approx 1.91387\\dots$\nRounding to three significant figures, $p \\approx 1.91$.\n\nThe parameter $p = a/\\delta$ characterizes the current distribution within the conductor.\n- **Weak skin effect regime ($p \\ll 1$):** If the radius $a$ is much smaller than the skin depth $\\delta$, the current density is nearly uniform across the conductor's cross-section. The AC resistance is approximately equal to the DC resistance.\n- **Strong skin effect regime ($p \\gg 1$):** If the radius $a$ is much larger than the skin depth $\\delta$, the current is confined to a thin layer near the surface of the conductor. The central part of the conductor carries negligible current, leading to a significant increase in the AC resistance.\n\nIn this problem, we found $p \\approx 1.91$. This value is greater than $1$, indicating that the conductor radius is larger than the skin depth ($a \\approx 1.91\\delta$). The field amplitude at the center of the conductor is reduced by a factor of approximately $e^{-p} = e^{-1.91} \\approx 0.148$ relative to its surface value. This is a substantial reduction, meaning the current density is highly non-uniform and concentrated near the surface. While the condition $p \\gg 1$ is not strictly met, the effect is significant and cannot be ignored for engineering design. Therefore, based on a first-principles analysis of current distribution, the conductor is operating in the strong skin effect regime, not the weak one. The justification is that the current-carrying cross-section is substantially reduced, which is the defining characteristic of the strong skin effect. This justifies considering mitigation strategies such as using Litz wire.\n\nThe final required value is $p$, rounded to three significant figures.",

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of electromagnetism and circuit theory, well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient information, and free of contradictions or ambiguities. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires finding the minimum integer number of Litz wire strands, $N$, that satisfy two constraints: one related to maximum current density and the other to maximum power dissipation. We will first determine the physical parameters of a single strand, verify the simplifying assumption about current distribution, and then derive and solve the constraints on $N$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the copper diameter, $d_{cu}$, and the copper cross-sectional area, $A_{cu,s}$, of a single strand. The strand outer diameter is given as $d_{s} = 0.10\\,\\text{mm} = 1 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{m}$, and the enamel insulation thickness is $t_{e} = 5\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}$.

This is valid if the copper diameter $d_{cu}$ is significantly smaller than the skin depth, $\\delta$. To calculate the skin depth, we first need the copper resistivity, $\\rho_{T}$, at the operating temperature $T = 120\\,\\text{°C}$.

All three loss components are present.\n$$R_{\\mathrm{AC,solid}} = R_{\\mathrm{DC,solid}} + \\Delta R_{\\mathrm{skin,solid}} + \\Delta R_{\\mathrm{prox,solid}}$$\nThe total excess AC resistance for the solid wire, $\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{AC,solid}}$, can be calculated from the given data:\n$$\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{AC,solid}} = R_{\\mathrm{AC,solid}} - R_{\\mathrm{DC,solid}} = 0.860\\,\\Omega - 0.180\\,\\Omega = 0.680\\,\\Omega$$\nThis excess resistance is the sum of the skin and proximity effect contributions for the solid wire:\n$$\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{AC,solid}} = \\Delta R_{\\mathrm{skin,solid}} + \\Delta R_{\\mathrm{prox,solid}} = 0.680\\,\\Omega$$\n\nNext, we apply the model to the Litz-wire inductor. The problem provides crucial simplifying assumptions for this case:\n1.  Because the individual strand diameter $d_{s}$ is much smaller than the skin depth $\\delta$, the skin effect within the conductor bundle is negligible. Thus, we can set $\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{skin,litz}} \\approx 0$.\n2.  Because the winding geometry and external magnetic field environment are identical, the resistance increase due to the proximity effect is the same for the Litz bundle as it is for the solid wire. Thus, $\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{prox,litz}} = \\Delta R_{\\mathrm{prox,solid}}$.\n\nApplying the general model to the Litz wire with these assumptions yields:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{AC,litz}} = R_{\\mathrm{DC,litz}} + \\Delta R_{\\mathrm{skin,litz}} + \\Delta R_{\\mathrm{prox,litz}}$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{AC,litz}} = R_{\\mathrm{DC,litz}} + 0 + \\Delta R_{\\mathrm{prox,solid}}$$\nThis equation allows us to isolate the proximity-effect contribution, which is common to both inductor variants. We can solve for $\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{prox,solid}}$ using the Litz-wire measurement data:\n$$\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{prox,solid}} = R_{\\mathrm{AC,litz}} - R_{\\mathrm{DC,litz}}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{prox,solid}} = 0.520\\,\\Omega - 0.192\\,\\Omega = 0.328\\,\\Omega$$\n\nNow that the proximity-effect contribution is known, we can determine the skin-effect contribution for the solid wire by returning to the equation for the solid wire's excess resistance:\n$$\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{AC,solid}} = \\Delta R_{\\mathrm{skin,solid}} + \\Delta R_{\\mathrm{prox,solid}}$$\nSolving for $\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{skin,solid}}$:\n$$\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{skin,solid}} = \\Delta R_{\\mathrm{AC,solid}} - \\Delta R_{\\mathrm{prox,solid}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{skin,solid}} = 0.680\\,\\Omega - 0.328\\,\\Omega = 0.352\\,\\Omega$$\n\nThe problem asks for the fraction of the solid-wire inductor's excess AC resistance that is attributable to the skin effect. Let this fraction be denoted by $F_{\\mathrm{skin}}$. This is the ratio of the skin-effect resistance increase to the total excess AC resistance for the solid wire.\n$$F_{\\mathrm{skin}} = \\frac{\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{skin,solid}}}{\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{AC,solid}}}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values we have determined:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{skin}} = \\frac{0.352\\,\\Omega}{0.680\\,\\Omega}$$\n$$F_{\\mathrm{skin}} \\approx 0.517647\\dots$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$F_{\\mathrm{skin}} = 0.5176$$",
