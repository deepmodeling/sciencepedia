The device dissipates a constant power $P$, which must be equal to the total heat transferred away from the surface at steady state. The total heat transfer is the sum of heat loss due to convection, $Q_{\\text{conv}}$, and radiation, $Q_{\\text{rad}}$.\n\nThe convective heat loss is governed by Newton's law of cooling. The convective heat flux is $q''_{\\text{conv}} = h(T_s - T_{\\infty})$. The total convective heat loss from the surface of area $A$ is:\n$$Q_{\\text{conv}} = h A (T_s - T_{\\infty})$$\n\nThe radiative heat loss is governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann law for a diffuse-gray surface with emissivity $\\epsilon$ in large surroundings at temperature $T_{\\infty}$.

            "problem": "A monolithic silicon power metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) die of uniform temperature is mounted face-up inside a compact power electronics module. The exposed top surface of the die, which is approximately diffuse-gray with emissivity $\\epsilon_{s}$, exchanges radiation with a cluttered environment composed of three isothermal, large, diffuse-black surfaces: a surrounding Printed Circuit Board (PCB) region at temperature $T_{A}$, a nearby heat-sink fin at temperature $T_{B}$, and an upper opening that effectively sees the far-field surroundings (approximated as a diffuse-black “sky”) at temperature $T_{\\mathrm{sky}}$.

The concepts of diffuse-gray surfaces, blackbody radiation, view factors, Newton's law of cooling, and the Stefan-Boltzmann law are standard in thermal engineering. The scenario represents a classic thermal analysis problem in power electronics. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and conditions for a unique solution. The given values are physically realistic for a power semiconductor device in operation. The provided view factors sum to unity ($0.4 + 0.3 + 0.3 = 1$), satisfying the summation rule for an enclosure, which confirms the internal consistency of the geometric setup. The problem is objective and free of ambiguity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A detailed solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of Net Radiative Heat Flux, $q''_{\\mathrm{rad}}$\n\nThe net radiative heat flux, $q''_{\\mathrm{rad}}$, from the die surface is the difference between the radiation emitted by the surface and the radiation absorbed by it.\n\nThe flux emitted by the die surface ($s$), which is a diffuse-gray surface at temperature $T_s$ with emissivity $\\epsilon_s$, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n$$q''_{\\mathrm{emitted}} = E_s = \\epsilon_s \\sigma T_s^4$$\nwhere $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nThe radiation incident on the die surface, known as irradiation ($G_s$), comes from the three surrounding surfaces: the PCB ($A$), the fin ($B$), and the sky. The rate at which energy leaves a surrounding surface $j$ and strikes the die surface $s$ is proportional to the radiosity of surface $j$, $J_j$, and the view factor from surface $s$ to surface $j$, $F_{sj}$. The total irradiation on surface $s$ is the sum of contributions from all surrounding surfaces:\n$$G_s = \\sum_{j} F_{sj} J_j = F_{sA}J_A + F_{sB}J_B + F_{s\\mathrm{sky}}J_{\\mathrm{sky}}$$\n\nThe problem states that the surrounding surfaces are large and diffuse-black. For a black surface, the emissivity is $\\epsilon_j = 1$, and thus the absorptivity is $\\alpha_j = 1$ and the reflectivity is $\\rho_j = 0$. The radiosity of a black surface is therefore equal to its blackbody emissive power:\n$$J_j = E_{b,j} = \\sigma T_j^4$$\nApplying this to our three surrounding surfaces:\n-   $J_A = \\sigma T_A^4$\n-   $J_B = \\sigma T_B^4$\n-   $J_{\\mathrm{sky}} = \\sigma T_{\\mathrm{sky}}^4$\n\nSubstituting these expressions back into the equation for irradiation $G_s$:\n$$G_s = F_{sA}(\\sigma T_A^4) + F_{sB}(\\sigma T_B^4) + F_{s\\mathrm{sky}}(\\sigma T_{\\mathrm{sky}}^4)$$\n$$G_s = \\sigma (F_{sA}T_A^4 + F_{sB}T_B^4 + F_{s\\mathrm{sky}}T_{\\mathrm{sky}}^4) = \\sigma \\sum_{j} F_{sj} T_j^4$$\n\nThe flux absorbed by the die surface is the product of its absorptivity, $\\alpha_s$, and the irradiation, $G_s$. For a gray surface, the absorptivity is equal to the emissivity, $\\alpha_s = \\epsilon_s$.\n$$q''_{\\mathrm{absorbed}} = \\alpha_s G_s = \\epsilon_s G_s = \\epsilon_s \\sigma \\sum_{j} F_{sj}T_j^4$$\n\nThe net radiative heat flux leaving the die surface is then:\n$$q''_{\\mathrm{rad}} = q''_{\\mathrm{emitted}} - q''_{\\mathrm{absorbed}}$$\n$$q''_{\\mathrm{rad}} = \\epsilon_s \\sigma T_s^4 - \\epsilon_s \\sigma \\sum_{j} F_{sj}T_j^4$$\nFactoring out $\\epsilon_s \\sigma$, we obtain the general expression for the net radiative heat flux:\n$$q''_{\\mathrm{rad}} = \\epsilon_s \\sigma \\left( T_s^4 - \\sum_{j} F_{sj}T_j^4 \\right)$$\nExplicitly written for the three surfaces:\n$$q''_{\\mathrm{rad}} = \\epsilon_s \\sigma \\left( T_s^4 - (F_{sA}T_A^4 + F_{sB}T_B^4 + F_{s\\mathrm{sky}}T_{\\mathrm{sky}}^4) \\right)$$\nThis expression shows that the cluttered environment acts as an effective radiative sink. The term $\\sum_{j} F_{sj}T_j^4$ represents a view-factor-weighted average of the fourth power of the surrounding temperatures. This term defines an effective blackbody temperature of the surroundings as seen by the die surface.\n\n### Calculation of Total Cooling Heat Flux, $q''_{\\mathrm{tot}}$\n\nThe total heat flux removed from the die surface, $q''_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, is the sum of the convective heat flux, $q''_{\\mathrm{conv}}$, and the net radiative heat flux, $q''_{\\mathrm{rad}}$:\n$$q''_{\\mathrm{tot}} = q''_{\\mathrm{conv}} + q''_{\\mathrm{rad}}$$\n\nFirst, we compute the convective heat flux using Newton's law of cooling:\n$$q''_{\\mathrm{conv}} = h (T_s - T_{\\infty})$$\nUsing the given values $h = 10\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, $T_s = 370\\,\\mathrm{K}$, and $T_{\\infty} = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$:\n$$q''_{\\mathrm{conv}} = 10 \\, (370 - 300) = 10 \\, (70) = 700\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$$\n\nNext, we compute the net radiative heat flux using the derived expression and the given parameters.\nLet's first evaluate the temperature terms raised to the fourth power:\n-   $T_s^4 = (370)^4 = 18,741,610,000\\,\\mathrm{K}^4$\n-   $T_A^4 = (350)^4 = 15,006,250,000\\,\\mathrm{K}^4$\n-   $T_B^4 = (330)^4 = 11,859,210,000\\,\\mathrm{K}^4$\n-   $T_{\\mathrm{sky}}^4 = (300)^4 = 8,100,000,000\\,\\mathrm{K}^4$\n\nNow, compute the view-factor-weighted sum of the surrounding temperatures to the fourth power:\n$$\\sum_{j} F_{sj}T_j^4 = F_{sA}T_A^4 + F_{sB}T_B^4 + F_{s\\mathrm{sky}}T_{\\mathrm{sky}}^4$$\n$$\\sum_{j} F_{sj}T_j^4 = (0.4)(15,006,250,000) + (0.3)(11,859,210,000) + (0.3)(8,100,000,000)$$\n$$\\sum_{j} F_{sj}T_j^4 = 6,002,500,000 + 3,557,763,000 + 2,430,000,000 = 11,990,263,000\\,\\mathrm{K}^4$$\n\nNow, substitute these values into the expression for $q''_{\\mathrm{rad}}$:\n$$q''_{\\mathrm{rad}} = \\epsilon_s \\sigma \\left( T_s^4 - \\sum_{j} F_{sj}T_j^4 \\right)$$\n$$q''_{\\mathrm{rad}} = (0.85) (5.670374419 \\times 10^{-8}) (18,741,610,000 - 11,990,263,000)$$\n$$q''_{\\mathrm{rad}} = (0.85) (5.670374419 \\times 10^{-8}) (6,751,347,000)$$\n$$q''_{\\mathrm{rad}} \\approx 325.3983\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the total heat flux:\n$$q''_{\\mathrm{tot}} = q''_{\\mathrm{conv}} + q''_{\\mathrm{rad}}$$\n$$q''_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 700 + 325.3983 = 1025.3983\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$$\n\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures, we get:\n$$q''_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\approx 1025\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$$",

The physical scenario is entirely feasible.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a standard problem in transient heat transfer analysis, grounded in sound physical principles and mathematical methods. The solution process may now proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Governing ODE\nThe analysis begins with the principle of energy conservation applied to the lumped thermal node. For $t>0$, there is no internal heat generation. The rate of change of internal energy of the node must equal the rate of heat loss to the surroundings.\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dt} = -q_{\\text{out}}\n$$\nThe internal energy of the lumped node is $E = C_{\\text{th}}T$, so its rate of change is $\\frac{dE}{dt} = C_{\\text{th}}\\frac{dT}{dt}$. The total heat output, $q_{\\text{out}}$, is the sum of heat loss due to convection, $q_{\\text{conv}}$, and radiation, $q_{\\text{rad}}$.\n\nAccording to Newton's law of cooling, the convective heat flux is:\n$$\nq_{\\text{conv}} = hA(T - T_{a})\n$$\nFor a diffuse-gray surface radiating to a large enclosure at temperature $T_{a}$, the radiative heat flux is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n$$\nq_{\\text{rad}} = \\epsilon \\sigma A (T^4 - T_{a}^4)\n$$\nCombining these terms, the energy balance equation becomes:\n$$\nC_{\\text{th}}\\frac{dT}{dt} = - \\left[ hA(T - T_{a}) + \\epsilon \\sigma A (T^4 - T_{a}^4) \\right]\n$$\nThis is the governing nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) for the node temperature $T(t)$.\n\n### Convection-Only Case\nFor the convection-only case, the radiation term is neglected ($\\epsilon=0$). The ODE simplifies to a linear equation:\n$$\nC_{\\text{th}}\\frac{dT}{dt} = -hA(T - T_{a})\n$$\nTo solve this, let $\\theta(t) = T(t) - T_{a}$. Then $\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = \\frac{dT}{dt}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\nC_{\\text{th}}\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = -hA\\theta\n$$\nThis is a first-order separable ODE: $\\frac{d\\theta}{\\theta} = -\\frac{hA}{C_{\\text{th}}}dt$. Integrating both sides yields $\\ln(\\theta) = -\\frac{hA}{C_{\\text{th}}}t + K$, where $K$ is the integration constant. The solution is $\\theta(t) = \\exp(K)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{hA}{C_{\\text{th}}}t\\right)$.\nUsing the initial condition $T(0) = T_{i}$, we have $\\theta(0) = T_{i} - T_{a}$. This gives $\\exp(K) = T_{i} - T_{a}$.\nThe exact solution for the temperature difference is $\\theta(t) = (T_{i} - T_{a})\\exp\\left(-\\frac{hA}{C_{\\text{th}}}t\\right)$, and for the temperature itself:\n$$\nT(t) = T_{a} + (T_{i} - T_{a})\\exp\\left(-\\frac{hA}{C_{\\text{th}}}t\\right)\n$$\nThe instantaneous decay rate for the convection-only case, $\\gamma_{\\text{conv}}$, is evaluated using its definition:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\text{conv}} \\equiv -\\left.\\frac{d}{dt}\\ln(T(t)-T_{a})\\right|_{t=0} = -\\left.\\frac{d}{dt}\\ln(\\theta(t))\\right|_{t=0}\n$$\nFrom the solution, $\\ln(\\theta(t)) = \\ln(T_{i}-T_{a}) - \\frac{hA}{C_{\\text{th}}}t$. Differentiating with respect to $t$ gives $-\\frac{hA}{C_{\\text{th}}}$.\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\text{conv}} = - \\left(-\\frac{hA}{C_{\\text{th}}}\\right) = \\frac{hA}{C_{\\text{th}}}\n$$\n\n### Combined Case with Linearization\nFor the combined convection and radiation case, we linearize the radiative heat flux term, $q_{\\text{rad}} = \\epsilon \\sigma A (T^4 - T_{a}^4)$. The problem specifies a \"frozen-secant linearization,\" which approximates the net radiative heat flow as $q_{\\text{rad,lin}} = h_{\\text{rad,eff}} A (T - T_a)$. The effective radiative heat transfer coefficient, $h_{\\text{rad,eff}}$, is defined such that the total effective radiative conductance, $h_{\\text{rad,eff}} A$, equals the secant slope of the radiative heat flow function $q_{\\text{rad}}(T)$ between $T_i$ and $T_a$.\nThe total radiative heat flow at $T$ is $q_{\\text{rad}}(T) = \\epsilon \\sigma A T^4$. The net flow from the object to the ambient at $T$ is $q_{\\text{rad}}(T) - q_{\\text{rad}}(T_a)$. The secant slope conductance between $T_i$ and $T_a$ is:\n$$\n\\text{Conductance} = \\frac{q_{\\text{rad}}(T_i) - q_{\\text{rad}}(T_a)}{T_i - T_a} = \\frac{\\epsilon \\sigma A (T_i^4 - T_a^4)}{T_i - T_a}\n$$\nThis conductance is modeled as $h_{\\text{rad,eff}} A$. Thus,\n$$\nh_{\\text{rad,eff}} A = \\frac{\\epsilon \\sigma A (T_i^4 - T_a^4)}{T_i - T_a}\n$$\nDividing by $A$ and using the identity $a^4-b^4 = (a-b)(a+b)(a^2+b^2)$, we find $h_{\\text{rad,eff}}$:\n$$\nh_{\\text{rad,eff}} = \\epsilon \\sigma (T_i + T_a)(T_i^2 + T_a^2)\n$$\nThe total linearized heat flux is $q_{\\text{out,lin}} = q_{\\text{conv}} + q_{\\text{rad,lin}} = hA(T-T_a) + h_{\\text{rad,eff}}A(T-T_a) = (h+h_{\\text{rad,eff}})A(T-T_a)$.\nThe linearized governing ODE is:\n$$\nC_{\\text{th}}\\frac{dT}{dt} = -(h+h_{\\text{rad,eff}})A(T-T_a)\n$$\nThis equation has the same form as the convection-only case, with $h$ replaced by an effective total coefficient $h_{\\text{total}} = h + h_{\\text{rad,eff}}$. By analogy, the instantaneous decay rate $\\gamma_{\\text{combined}}$ is:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\text{combined}} = \\frac{(h+h_{\\text{rad,eff}})A}{C_{\\text{th}}}\n$$\n\n### Calculation of the Ratio $R$\nThe ratio $R$ is defined as $R \\equiv \\frac{\\gamma_{\\text{combined}}}{\\gamma_{\\text{conv}}}$. Substituting the derived expressions:\n$$\nR = \\frac{(h+h_{\\text{rad,eff}})A/C_{\\text{th}}}{hA/C_{\\text{th}}} = \\frac{h+h_{\\text{rad,eff}}}{h} = 1 + \\frac{h_{\\text{rad,eff}}}{h}\n$$\nWe now substitute the numerical values to calculate $R$. First, we compute $h_{\\text{rad,eff}}$:\n$h=12$, $\\epsilon=0.85$, $\\sigma=5.670374419\\times 10^{-8}$, $T_{a}=300$, $T_{i}=360$.\n$$\nh_{\\text{rad,eff}} = (0.85)(5.670374419\\times 10^{-8})((360)+(300))((360)^2+(300)^2)\n$$\n$$\nh_{\\text{rad,eff}} = (0.85)(5.670374419\\times 10^{-8})(660)(129600+90000)\n$$\n$$\nh_{\\text{rad,eff}} = (0.85)(5.670374419\\times 10^{-8})(660)(219600)\n$$\n$$\nh_{\\text{rad,eff}} \\approx 6.9856417\\,\\text{W m}^{-2}\\text{K}^{-1}\n$$\nNow, we can compute the ratio $R$:\n$$\nR = 1 + \\frac{6.9856417}{12} = 1 + 0.5821368\n$$\n$$\nR \\approx 1.5821368\n$$\nRounding the final result to four significant figures as requested gives $R = 1.582$.",
