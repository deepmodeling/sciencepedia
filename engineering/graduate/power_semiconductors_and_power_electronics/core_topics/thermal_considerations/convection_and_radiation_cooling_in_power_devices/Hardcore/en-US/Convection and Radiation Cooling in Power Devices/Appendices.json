For advected quantities like temperature and turbulence variables, a zero-normal-gradient (Neumann) condition is applied to prevent unphysical upstream influence.\n        $$ p = p_{\\text{out}} \\quad \\text{on} \\ \\Gamma_{\\text{out}} $$\n        $$ \\frac{\\partial T_f}{\\partial n} = 0 \\quad \\text{on} \\ \\Gamma_{\\text{out}} $$\n        Here, $\\partial/\\partial n$ denotes the derivative along the outward normal to the boundary.\n    -   **Impermeable Solid Walls ($\\Gamma_{sf}$):** At the wetted solid-fluid interface, the no-slip condition is applied for velocity.\n        $$ \\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{0} \\quad \\text{on} \\ \\Gamma_{sf} $$\n        The thermal condition is a coupling condition derived from energy conservation, which will be detailed in Part B. It establishes continuity of temperature and heat flux. At the interface, the fluid temperature equals the solid wall temperature, $T_f = T_s = T_w$.\n\n2.  **Solid Subdomain ($\\Omega_s$):** The heat transfer within the solid is governed by the steady-state heat conduction equation, $\\nabla \\cdot (k_s \\nabla T_s) = 0$, assuming no internal heat generation.\n    -   **Solid–Fluid Interface ($\\Gamma_{sf}$):** This is an internal boundary where the solid and fluid domains are coupled. The condition requires continuity of temperature and heat flux. The heat conducted from the solid to the interface must equal the heat transported away from the interface by convection and radiation. This is expressed as:\n        $$ -k_s \\frac{\\partial T_s}{\\partial n} = q^{\\prime\\prime}_{\\text{conv}} + q^{\\prime\\prime}_{\\text{rad}} \\quad \\text{on} \\ \\Gamma_{sf} $$\n        where $\\mathbf{n}$ is the unit normal pointing from the solid into the fluid. The right-hand side terms are functions of the interface temperature $T_w$ and fluid properties. This equation will be derived in Part B.\n    -   **External Radiating Surfaces ($\\Gamma_{\\text{rad}}$):** These are surfaces of the heat sink not in contact with the forced airflow (e.g., the baseplate underside). Assuming they are perfectly insulated against conduction and convection, the only heat transfer mechanism is surface radiation to the surroundings. The boundary condition is given by the Stefan–Boltzmann law:\n        $$ -k_s \\frac{\\partial T_s}{\\partial n} = q^{\\prime\\prime}_{\\text{rad}} = \\varepsilon \\sigma (T_s^4 - T_{\\text{sur}}^4) \\quad \\text{on} \\ \\Gamma_{\\text{rad}} $$\n        Here, $\\mathbf{n}$ is the outward-pointing normal from the solid surface.\n\nPart B. Derivation of the Coupled Interface Energy Balance\n\nThe core principle for deriving the boundary condition at the solid-fluid interface $\\Gamma_{sf}$ is the conservation of energy. For any infinitesimally small control surface area $dA$ on the interface, the rate of energy arriving at the surface from the solid side must equal the rate of energy leaving the surface to the fluid and surroundings. This enforces the continuity of heat flux.\n\nLet $\\mathbf{n}$ be the unit normal vector on the interface $\\Gamma_{sf}$, pointing from the solid domain $\\Omega_s$ into the fluid domain $\\Omega_f$.\n\n1.  **Conductive Heat Flux from the Solid:** According to Fourier's law of heat conduction, the heat flux vector in the solid is $\\mathbf{q}^{\\prime\\prime}_{\\text{cond},s} = -k_s \\nabla T_s$. The component of this flux leaving the solid and crossing the interface is the projection onto the normal vector $\\mathbf{n}$.\n    $$ q^{\\prime\\prime}_{\\text{cond}} = \\mathbf{q}^{\\prime\\prime}_{\\text{cond},s} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = (-k_s \\nabla T_s) \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = -k_s \\frac{\\partial T_s}{\\partial n} $$\n    This expression, $q^{\\prime\\prime}_{\\text{cond}}$, represents the heat flux leaving the solid surface, with a positive sign indicating heat flow from solid to fluid.\n\n2.  **Convective Heat Flux to the Fluid:** Newton's law of cooling describes the heat transferred from the solid wall to the adjacent fluid. Let $T_w$ be the temperature of the wall (interface) and $T_{\\infty}$ be a characteristic local temperature of the fluid near the wall (e.g., the bulk mean temperature or the temperature in the first fluid cell). The convective heat flux is:\n    $$ q^{\\prime\\prime}_{\\text{conv}} = h (T_w - T_{\\infty}) $$\n    Here, $h$ is the local heat transfer coefficient. This flux is defined as positive when heat flows from the wall to the fluid ($T_w > T_{\\infty}$).\n\n3.  **Radiative Heat Flux to the Surroundings:** The solid surface also exchanges heat via radiation with its large surroundings, which are at a uniform temperature $T_{\\text{sur}}$. According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law for a diffuse-gray surface:\n    $$ q^{\\prime\\prime}_{\\text{rad}} = \\varepsilon \\sigma (T_w^4 - T_{\\text{sur}}^4) $$\n    where $\\varepsilon$ is the surface emissivity and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. This net flux is positive when heat radiates away from the wall ($T_w > T_{\\text{sur}}$).\n\n4.  **Energy Balance:** At steady state, with no energy storage or generation at the infinitesimally thin interface, the heat flux leaving the solid must equal the sum of the heat fluxes entering the fluid and the surroundings.\n    $$ (\\text{Flux leaving solid}) = (\\text{Flux entering fluid by convection}) + (\\text{Flux leaving by radiation}) $$\n    $$ q^{\\prime\\prime}_{\\text{cond}} = q^{\\prime\\prime}_{\\text{conv}} + q^{\\prime\\prime}_{\\text{rad}} $$\n    Substituting the expressions from the fundamental laws yields the complete, coupled, nonlinear energy balance at the solid-fluid interface:\n    $$ -k_s \\frac{\\partial T_s}{\\partial n} = h (T_w - T_{\\infty}) + \\varepsilon \\sigma (T_w^4 - T_{\\text{sur}}^4) $$\n    At the interface, we also have temperature continuity, $T_s = T_f = T_w$. This equation serves as the boundary condition for the heat equation in the solid and couples it to the energy equation in the fluid (which determines $h$ and $T_{\\infty}$) and the radiation environment (which determines $T_{\\text{sur}}$).\n\nPart C. Computational Solution for Interface Temperature\n\nFor this part, we analyze a simplified scenario where the conductive heat flux leaving a small patch of the solid surface, $q^{\\prime\\prime}_{\\text{cond}}$, is a known, constant value. This uncouples the problem from the full solid-domain conduction solution and reduces the energy balance equation to a scalar algebraic equation for the unknown interface temperature, $T_w$.\n\nThe equation to be solved is:\n$$ q^{\\prime\\prime}_{\\text{cond}} = h (T_w - T_{\\infty}) + \\varepsilon \\sigma (T_w^4 - T_{\\text{sur}}^4) $$\nThis is a nonlinear equation for $T_w$. To solve it numerically, we can define a function $f(T_w)$ and find its root:\n$$ f(T_w) = h (T_w - T_{\\infty}) + \\varepsilon \\sigma (T_w^4 - T_{\\text{sur}}^4) - q^{\\prime\\prime}_{\\text{cond}} = 0 $$\nRearranging the terms, we can see this is a quartic equation of the form:\n$$ \\varepsilon \\sigma T_w^4 + h T_w - (h T_{\\infty} + \\varepsilon \\sigma T_{\\text{sur}}^4 + q^{\\prime\\prime}_{\\text{cond}}) = 0 $$\nSince physical temperatures must be positive ($T_w > 0$), and all parameters ($h$, $\\varepsilon$, $\\sigma$) are non-negative, the derivative of $f(T_w)$ with respect to $T_w$ is:\n$$ f'(T_w) = h + 4 \\varepsilon \\sigma T_w^3 $$\nThis derivative is strictly positive for $T_w > 0$ (unless both $h=0$ and $\\varepsilon=0$, a trivial case). A strictly positive derivative guarantees that $f(T_w)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $T_w$. Therefore, a unique positive real root for $T_w$ exists and can be found efficiently using numerical root-finding algorithms, such as Newton-Raphson or Brent's method.\n\nThe computational task is to implement a solver for this equation for each of the five provided test cases. The solver will be implemented in Python using the `scipy.optimize.root_scalar` function, which provides robust and efficient methods for finding roots of scalar functions. An initial guess or a bracketing interval is required. Given the physical context, temperatures are expected to be in the range of hundreds of Kelvin. A reasonable bracket for a solver like `brentq` would be from a low temperature (e.g., $1\\ \\text{K}$) to a high temperature (e.g., $10000\\ \\text{K}$), as the solution is guaranteed to lie within such a wide physical range.\n\n```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import root_scalar\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the interface temperature Tw for a set of heat transfer cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Stefan-Boltzmann constant in W m^-2 K^-4\n    SIGMA = 5.670374419e-8\n    \n    # Test suite: (q_cond, h, epsilon, T_inf, T_sur)\n    # q_cond: W/m^2\n    # h: W/m^2/K\n    # epsilon: dimensionless\n    # T_inf: K\n    # T_sur: K\n    test_cases = [\n        (2.0e4, 50.0, 0.9, 300.0, 300.0),\n        (1.0e3, 5.0, 0.9, 300.0, 300.0),\n        (5.0e2, 0.0, 1.0, 300.0, 290.0),\n        (-5.0e3, 30.0, 0.8, 320.0, 300.0),\n        (2.0e4, 200.0, 0.05, 310.0, 295.0),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        q_cond, h, epsilon, t_inf, t_sur = case\n\n        # Define the function f(Tw) whose root we want to find.\n        # f(Tw) = h * (Tw - T_inf) + epsilon * sigma * (Tw^4 - T_sur^4) - q_cond = 0\n        def energy_balance_equation(tw):\n            # The temperature tw must be positive.\n            if tw = 0:\n                # Return a large number for non-physical inputs to guide the solver\n                return np.inf\n            \n            conv_flux = h * (tw - t_inf)\n            rad_flux = epsilon * SIGMA * (tw**4 - t_sur**4)\n            \n            return conv_flux + rad_flux - q_cond\n\n        # The function is monotonic for Tw > 0.
