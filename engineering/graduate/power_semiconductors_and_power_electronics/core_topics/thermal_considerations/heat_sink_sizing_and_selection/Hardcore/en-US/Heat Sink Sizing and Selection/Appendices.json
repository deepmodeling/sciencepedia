It is self-contained, scientifically grounded in the principles of steady-state heat transfer, and well-posed, admitting a unique solution. All provided parameters are physically realistic and consistent.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the minimum attainable junction temperature of a power semiconductor for a set of candidate heat sinks. The analysis is based on the one-dimensional, steady-state thermal resistance model, which is an analogue to Ohm's law for electrical circuits. In this model, temperature difference ($\\Delta T$) is analogous to voltage drop, power dissipation ($P_{loss}$) is analogous to current, and thermal resistance ($\\theta$) is analogous to electrical resistance. The governing equation is:\n$$ \\Delta T = P_{loss} \\cdot \\theta $$\n\nThe thermal path from the semiconductor junction to the ambient air is described as a series network of three thermal resistances:\n1.

Applying the thermal resistance model:\n$$ T_j - T_a = P_{loss} \\cdot \\theta_{ja} $$\nThis equation can be rearranged to solve for the junction temperature:\n$$ T_j = T_a + P_{loss} \\cdot (\\theta_{jc} + R_{th,\\mathrm{TIM}} + \\theta_{sa}) $$\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Power dissipation: $P_{loss} = 20\\,\\mathrm{W}$.\n- Ambient temperature: $T_a = 30\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n- Fixed thermal resistances: $\\theta_{jc} = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{K/W}$ and $R_{th,\\mathrm{TIM}} = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{K/W}$.\n- Candidate heat sink resistances: $\\theta_{sa} \\in \\{1.0,\\,0.6,\\,0.4\\}\\,\\mathrm{K/W}$.\n\nA key point of unit consistency must be addressed. The thermal resistances are given in units of $\\mathrm{K/W}$ (Kelvin per Watt), which implies that the calculated temperature rise, $P_{loss} \\cdot \\theta_{ja}$, will be in Kelvin. However, the ambient temperature is given in degrees Celsius. Since a temperature difference has the same numerical value in Kelvin and degrees Celsius ($\\Delta T$ in $\\mathrm{K} = \\Delta T$ in $^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$), the calculated temperature rise can be directly added to the ambient temperature in degrees Celsius to obtain the final junction temperature in degrees Celsius.\n\nTo find the minimum attainable junction temperature, we must minimize the total thermal resistance, $\\theta_{ja}$. Since $P_{loss}$, $T_a$, $\\theta_{jc}$, and $R_{th,\\mathrm{TIM}}$ are all constant, $T_j$ is minimized by selecting the candidate heat sink with the lowest thermal resistance, $\\theta_{sa}$. From the set of candidates, the minimum value is:\n$$ \\theta_{sa, \\mathrm{min}} = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{K/W} $$\n\nNow, we calculate the minimum total junction-to-ambient thermal resistance, $\\theta_{ja, \\mathrm{min}}$:\n$$ \\theta_{ja, \\mathrm{min}} = \\theta_{jc} + R_{th,\\mathrm{TIM}} + \\theta_{sa, \\mathrm{min}} $$\n$$ \\theta_{ja, \\mathrm{min}} = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{K/W} + 0.1\\,\\mathrm{K/W} + 0.4\\,\\mathrm{K/W} = 0.7\\,\\mathrm{K/W} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the minimum junction temperature, $T_{j, \\mathrm{min}}$, using this value:\n$$ T_{j, \\mathrm{min}} = T_a + P_{loss} \\cdot \\theta_{ja, \\mathrm{min}} $$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$ T_{j, \\mathrm{min}} = 30\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} + (20\\,\\mathrm{W}) \\cdot (0.7\\,\\mathrm{K/W}) $$\n$$ T_{j, \\mathrm{min}} = 30\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} + 14\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} $$\n$$ T_{j, \\mathrm{min}} = 44\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} $$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be reported to four significant figures.

It presents a standard engineering calculation based on fundamental principles of heat transfer. All necessary data are provided, and the assumptions are clearly stated and physically reasonable for a first-order analysis. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation from first principles. The two governing principles are Fourier's law of heat conduction and the definition of thermal resistance.\n\nFor steady-state, one-dimensional heat conduction, Fourier's law is expressed as:\n$$q = -k A \\frac{dT}{dx}$$\nwhere $q$ is the rate of heat transfer, $k$ is the thermal conductivity of the material, $A$ is the cross-sectional area normal to the direction of heat flow, and $\\frac{dT}{dx}$ is the temperature gradient along the direction of heat flow, $x$.\n\nThe problem states that the heat flow is uniform and the material properties are constant.
