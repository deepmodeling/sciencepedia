The instantaneous power is the product of the device voltage, $v_{ds}(t)$, and the device current, $i_d(t)$.\n$$E_{sw} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} p(t) dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} v_{ds}(t) i_d(t) dt$$\nWe must first define the expressions for $v_{ds}(t)$ and $i_d(t)$ based on the problem statement. The entire switching event, where either voltage or current is changing, spans from $t=0$ to $t = \\Delta + t_i = 50\\ \\mathrm{ns}$.\n\nThe voltage across the MOSFET, $v_{ds}(t)$, falls linearly from $V_{dc}$ at $t=0$ to $0$ at $t=t_v$.
