            "problem": "A junction-to-ambient thermal path of a power semiconductor device is modeled as a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. Let the applied power be the time-dependent input $P(t)$ and the resulting junction temperature rise be the output $\\Theta(t)$ (in Kelvin). The LTI property implies superposition and time-shift invariance, so that the input-output relationship is a convolution of the input with the system’s impulse response. The thermal step response $Z_{\\mathrm{th,step}}(t)$ is the junction temperature rise produced by a unit power step input, and its time derivative is the impulse response $h(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} Z_{\\mathrm{th,step}}(t)$. In practice, the Foster thermal network representation models $Z_{\\mathrm{th,step}}(t)$ as a finite sum of decaying exponentials with positive coefficients and time constants, parameterized by $\\{R_{i},\\tau_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{N}$, where $R_{i} > 0$ and $\\tau_{i} > 0$ for all $i$. Consider a single rectangular power pulse of amplitude $P_{0} > 0$ and width $t_{p} > 0$, starting at $t=0$, namely\n$$\nP(t) = P_{0} \\,\\big(u(t) - u(t - t_{p})\\big),\n$$\nwhere $u(t)$ is the Heaviside unit step function, defined by $u(t)=0$ for $t<0$ and $u(t)=1$ for $t\\ge 0$. Starting from the convolution definition and the LTI principles above (without assuming any shortcut formulas), derive a closed-form analytic expression for the junction temperature rise $\\Theta(t)$ for all $t \\ge 0$ in terms of $P_{0}$, $t_{p}$, and the Foster parameters $\\{R_{i},\\tau_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{N}$.

            "solution": "The thermal impedance $Z_{th}(s)$ is given by a Foster-II representation of a passive RC network, which is a series connection of parallel RC branches. The impedance of the $i$-th branch, consisting of a resistor $r_i$ in parallel with a capacitor $c_i$, is $\\frac{r_i \\cdot (1/sc_i)}{r_i + 1/sc_i} = \\frac{r_i}{1+sr_ic_i}$.

Let $s = \\sigma + j\\omega$ with $\\sigma = \\Re\\{s\\} > 0$.\n    $$Z_{th}(s) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{r_i}{1 + (\\sigma + j\\omega)\\tau_i} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{r_i}{(1 + \\sigma\\tau_i) + j\\omega\\tau_i}$$\n    Taking the real part:\n    $$\\Re\\{Z_{th}(s)\\} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\Re\\left\\{\\frac{r_i ((1 + \\sigma\\tau_i) - j\\omega\\tau_i)}{(1 + \\sigma\\tau_i)^2 + (\\omega\\tau_i)^2}\\right\\} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{r_i(1 + \\sigma\\tau_i)}{(1 + \\sigma\\tau_i)^2 + (\\omega\\tau_i)^2}$$\n    Given that $r_i > 0$, $\\tau_i > 0$, and we assume $\\sigma > 0$, every term in the summation is strictly positive. Therefore, $\\Re\\{Z_{th}(s)\\} > 0$ for $\\Re\\{s\\} > 0$, and the function is positive-real.\n\n2.  **Stieltjes Function**: A Stieltjes function is analytic everywhere except for a cut on the negative real axis, is real for positive real arguments, and has a positive imaginary part in the upper half-plane. The poles of $Z_{th}(s)$ are at $s = -1/\\tau_i$, which are all on the negative real axis. Since the coefficients $r_i$ are real, $Z_{th}(s)$ is real for real $s$. The function is a sum of individual terms, each of which is a Stieltjes function, so $Z_{th}(s)$ itself is a Stieltjes function.\n\n3.  **Strictly Proper Function**: A rational function is strictly proper if the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator. As $|s| \\to \\infty$, each term behaves as $\\frac{r_i}{s\\tau_i}$, so $Z_{th}(s) \\to 0$. This confirms the function is strictly proper.\n\nNext, we derive the Cauer-II ladder representation using continued fraction expansion about $s = \\infty$. This expansion synthesizes a ladder network with shunt capacitors and series resistors.\nThe thermal admittance is $Y(s) = 1/Z_{th}(s)$. Since $Z_{th}(s) \\to 0$ as $s \\to \\infty$, $Y(s)$ must tend to infinity. For an RC network, the admittance can at most grow linearly with $s$.

The next element is a series resistance $R_1$, which is the high-frequency limit of the impedance $Z_1(s) = 1/Y_1(s)$.\n$$R_1 = \\lim_{s\\to\\infty} Z_1(s) = \\lim_{s\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{Y(s) - sC_0}$$\nTo find this limit, we expand $Y(s)$ for large $s$:\n$$Y(s) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{h_1}{s} + \\frac{h_2}{s^2} + O(s^{-3})} = \\frac{s}{h_1} \\left(1 + \\frac{h_2}{h_1 s} + O(s^{-2})\\right)^{-1}$$\nUsing the binomial approximation $(1+x)^{-1} \\approx 1-x$:\n$$Y(s) \\approx \\frac{s}{h_1}\\left(1 - \\frac{h_2}{h_1 s}\\right) = \\frac{s}{h_1} - \\frac{h_2}{h_1^2}$$\nThe remainder admittance is $Y_1(s) \\approx \\left(\\frac{s}{h_1} - \\frac{h_2}{h_1^2}\\right) - s C_0 = \\left(\\frac{s}{h_1} - \\frac{h_2}{h_1^2}\\right) - \\frac{s}{h_1} = -\\frac{h_2}{h_1^2}$.\nThus, the next series resistance is:\n$$R_1 = \\frac{1}{\\lim_{s\\to\\infty} Y_1(s)} = \\frac{1}{-h_2/h_1^2} = -\\frac{h_1^2}{h_2} = \\frac{\\left(\\sum_i r_i/\\tau_i\\right)^2}{\\sum_i r_i/\\tau_i^2}$$\nWe prove the positivity of these elements using the moment-based argument. The impulse response is $z(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{Z_{th}(s)\\} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{r_i}{\\tau_i} \\exp(-t/\\tau_i)$.

With initial condition $T_i(0)=0$, the solution is $T_i(t) = P_0 R_i (1 - e^{-t/(R_iC_i)})$.\nBy linearity, the total step response of the two-branch Foster network is the sum of the individual responses:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{step}}(t) = P_0 R_1 \\left(1 - e^{-t/(R_1 C_1)}\\right) + P_0 R_2 \\left(1 - e^{-t/(R_2 C_2)}\\right)$$\nA rectangular power pulse of amplitude $P_0$ and duration $t_p$ is applied. Since the power input is positive for $t \\in [0, t_p]$ and the system's impulse response is non-negative (for a passive RC network), the temperature rise $T(t)$ is a monotonically increasing function during the pulse.

Using a more accurate expansion $e^{-x} \\approx 1-x+x^2/2$, the sensitivity is $\\approx P_0 \\frac{1}{2} (\\frac{t_p}{\\tau_1})^2$, which is second-order small.\n$\\frac{\\partial T_{\\mathrm{peak}}}{\\partial C_1} = -P_0 \\frac{t_p}{C_1^2} e^{-t_p/\\tau_1} \\approx -P_0 \\frac{t_p}{C_1^2}$. This is a first-order term.\nConclusion for short pulses: The peak temperature is most sensitive to the thermal capacitances ($C_1, C_2$). These represent the immediate heat storage capacity of the layers near the junction.\n\n**Long pulse limit ($t_p \\gg \\tau_i$):**\nIn this limit, $e^{-t_p/\\tau_i} \\to 0$.\n$T_{\\mathrm{peak}} \\to P_0 (R_1 + R_2)$. This is the steady-state temperature rise for a constant power $P_0$.\nSensitivities:\n$\\frac{\\partial T_{\\mathrm{peak}}}{\\partial R_1} \\to P_0 (1 - 0 - 0) = P_0$.\n$\\frac{\\partial T_{\\mathrm{peak}}}{\\partial C_1} = -P_0 \\frac{t_p}{C_1^2} e^{-t_p/\\tau_1} \\to 0$, as the exponential term decays much faster than $t_p$ grows.\nConclusion for long pulses: The peak temperature is most sensitive to the thermal resistances ($R_1, R_2$). These represent the total opposition to heat flow to the ambient.\nThus, early-time behavior is dominated by capacitances, while late-time behavior is dominated by resistances.",
