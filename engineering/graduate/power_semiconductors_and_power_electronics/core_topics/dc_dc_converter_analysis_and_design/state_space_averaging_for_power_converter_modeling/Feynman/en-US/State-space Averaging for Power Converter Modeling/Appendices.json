            "problem": "An ideal boost direct current to direct current converter operates in continuous conduction mode. The topology consists of an input voltage source with voltage $v_g$, series inductor with inductance $L$, a controllable ideal switch to ground, an ideal diode to the output node, an output capacitor with capacitance $C$, and a resistive load with resistance $R$ connected in parallel with the capacitor. Let the inductor current be $i_L$ oriented from the source toward the switching node and let the capacitor voltage be $v_C$ across the output capacitor and load, with the output voltage defined as $v_o = v_C$. Assume ideal components, no parasitic resistances, and ideal diode and switch behavior.\n\nUsing Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL), Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL), and the constitutive relations of the inductor and capacitor, derive the piecewise-linear state-space models during the two switching subintervals in one switching period:\n- Subinterval $1$ (switch ON, diode OFF),\n- Subinterval $2$ (switch OFF, diode ON).\n\nUse the state vector $x = [\\, i_L \\;\\; v_C \\,]^{T}$ and the input $u = v_g$, and write each subinterval model in the form $\\dot{x} = A_k x + B_k u$ for $k \\in \\{1,2\\}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the piecewise-linear state-space models for an ideal boost converter operating in continuous conduction mode (CCM). The state vector is defined as $x = [\\, i_L \\;\\; v_C \\,]^{T}$, where $i_L$ is the inductor current and $v_C$ is the capacitor voltage. The input is $u = v_g$. The models must be in the form $\\dot{x} = A_k x + B_k u$ for the two switching subintervals, $k \\in \\{1, 2\\}$.\n\nThe fundamental state equations for the inductor and capacitor are derived from their constitutive relations:\nFor the inductor with inductance $L$, the voltage across it, $v_L$, is given by $v_L = L \\frac{di_L}{dt}$. This gives the first state equation:\n$$\n\\frac{di_L}{dt} = \\frac{1}{L} v_L\n$$\nFor the capacitor with capacitance $C$, the current through it, $i_C$, is given by $i_C = C \\frac{dv_C}{dt}$. This gives the second state equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dv_C}{dt} = \\frac{1}{C} i_C\n$$\nWe will now analyze the circuit during each of the two subintervals to find expressions for $v_L$ and $i_C$ in terms of the state variables $i_L$, $v_C$, and the input $v_g$.\n\n**Subinterval 1: Switch ON, Diode OFF**\n\nDuring this interval, the controllable switch is closed (ON), providing a direct path to ground. The diode is reverse-biased (OFF) because the output voltage $v_C$ (assumed positive) is higher than the switch voltage ($0$).\n\n1.  **Inductor Voltage ($v_L$) Analysis:** We apply Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) to the loop containing the input source $v_g$ and the inductor $L$. The switch shorts the right side of the inductor to ground.\n    $$\n    -v_g + v_L = 0 \\implies v_L = v_g\n    $$\n    Substituting this into the inductor state equation gives:\n    $$\n    \\frac{di_L}{dt} = \\frac{1}{L} v_g\n    $$\n\n2.  **Capacitor Current ($i_C$) Analysis:** Since the diode is OFF, the inductor is disconnected from the output stage. We apply Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at the output node (the top terminal of the capacitor). The capacitor current $i_C$ and the load current $i_R$ flow out of this node.\n    $$\n    i_C + i_R = 0\n    $$\n    The load is resistive with resistance $R$, so by Ohm's law, $i_R = \\frac{v_C}{R}$.\n    $$\n    i_C = -i_R = -\\frac{1}{R} v_C\n    $$\n    Substituting this into the capacitor state equation gives:\n    $$\n    \\frac{dv_C}{dt} = \\frac{1}{C} \\left( -\\frac{1}{R} v_C \\right) = -\\frac{1}{RC} v_C\n    $$\n\n3.  **State-Space Model for Subinterval 1:**\n    We arrange the two derived differential equations in the matrix form $\\dot{x} = A_1 x + B_1 u$:\n    $$\n    \\begin{pmatrix} \\dot{i_L} \\\\ \\dot{v_C} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\frac{1}{RC} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} i_L \\\\ v_C \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{L} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} v_g\n    $$\n    From this, we identify the matrices $A_1$ and $B_1$:\n    $$\n    A_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\frac{1}{RC} \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad B_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{L} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n\n**Subinterval 2: Switch OFF, Diode ON**\n\nDuring this interval, the switch is open (OFF). The inductor current $i_L$ now flows through the diode, which becomes forward-biased (ON). We assume the ideal diode has zero forward voltage drop.\n\n1.  **Inductor Voltage ($v_L$) Analysis:** We apply KVL to the loop containing the input source $v_g$, the inductor $L$, and the output stage (capacitor and load). Since the diode is treated as a short circuit, the voltage across the output stage, $v_C$, appears in this loop.\n    $$\n    -v_g + v_L + v_C = 0 \\implies v_L = v_g - v_C\n    $$\n    Substituting this into the inductor state equation gives:\n    $$\n    \\frac{di_L}{dt} = \\frac{1}{L} (v_g - v_C) = -\\frac{1}{L} v_C + \\frac{1}{L} v_g\n    $$\n\n2.  **Capacitor Current ($i_C$) Analysis:** We apply KCL at the output node. The inductor current $i_L$ flows into the node and splits between the capacitor current $i_C$ and the load current $i_R$.\n    $$\n    i_L = i_C + i_R\n    $$\n    Again, $i_R = \\frac{v_C}{R}$.\n    $$\n    i_C = i_L - i_R = i_L - \\frac{1}{R} v_C\n    $$\n    Substituting this into the capacitor state equation gives:\n    $$\n    \\frac{dv_C}{dt} = \\frac{1}{C} \\left( i_L - \\frac{1}{R} v_C \\right) = \\frac{1}{C} i_L - \\frac{1}{RC} v_C\n    $$\n\n3.  **State-Space Model for Subinterval 2:**\n    We arrange these equations in the matrix form $\\dot{x} = A_2 x + B_2 u$:\n    $$\n    \\begin{pmatrix} \\dot{i_L} \\\\ \\dot{v_C} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -\\frac{1}{L} \\\\ \\frac{1}{C} & -\\frac{1}{RC} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} i_L \\\\ v_C \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{L} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} v_g\n    $$\n    From this, we identify the matrices $A_2$ and $B_2$:\n    $$\n    A_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -\\frac{1}{L} \\\\ \\frac{1}{C} & -\\frac{1}{RC} \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad B_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{L} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n\n**Construction of the Block Matrix M**\n\nThe final task is to construct the $4 \\times 3$ block matrix $M$ as defined in the problem statement:\n$$\nM = \\begin{pmatrix} A_1 & B_1 \\\\ A_2 & B_2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe first two rows of $M$ are formed by concatenating $A_1$ ($2 \\times 2$) and $B_1$ ($2 \\times 1$).

Averaged Nonlinear Model and Linearization**\n\nThe averaged state-space model is obtained by weighting the matrices of the two states by their respective duty intervals, $d(t)$ and $1-d(t)$.\n$$ \\dot{x}(t) = (A_1 d(t) + A_2(1-d(t)))x(t) + (B_1 d(t) + B_2(1-d(t)))u(t) $$\nSince $B_1=B_2$, the input matrix is simply $B = B_1 = B_2$.\nThe averaged state-space matrices are:\n$$ A_{avg} = d A_1 + (1-d) A_2 = d \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\frac{1}{RC} \\end{pmatrix} + (1-d) \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -\\frac{1}{L} \\\\ \\frac{1}{C} & -\\frac{1}{RC} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -\\frac{1-d}{L} \\\\ \\frac{1-d}{C} & -\\frac{1}{RC} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ B_{avg} = B = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{L} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe averaged nonlinear model is:\n$$ \\dot{x}(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -\\frac{1-d(t)}{L} \\\\ \\frac{1-d(t)}{C} & -\\frac{1}{RC} \\end{pmatrix} x(t) + \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{L} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} u(t) $$\nTo linearize, we consider small perturbations about the steady-state operating point $(X, U, D) = \\left(\\begin{pmatrix} I \\\\ V \\end{pmatrix}, V_{g}, D \\right)$. The linearized model is $\\hat{\\dot{x}} = A \\hat{x} + B \\hat{u} + E \\hat{d}$.\n- The system matrix $A$ is the averaged matrix evaluated at the operating point:\n$$ A = A_{avg}|_{d=D} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -\\frac{1-D}{L} \\\\ \\frac{1-D}{C} & -\\frac{1}{RC} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n- The input matrix $B$ is the averaged input matrix evaluated at the operating point, which is constant:\n$$ B = B_{avg}|_{d=D} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{L} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n- The control matrix $E$ is given by $E = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial d} (A_{avg}x + B_{avg}u)|_{X, U, D} = ((A_1 - A_2)X + (B_1 - B_2)U)$:\n$$ A_1 - A_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\frac{1}{L} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{C} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\quad , \\quad B_1 - B_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ E = (A_1 - A_2)X = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\frac{1}{L} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{C} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} I \\\\ V \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{V}{L} \\\\ -\\frac{I}{C} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n- The output is $y(t) = \\hat{v}_{o}(t)$. The output matrix $C_{out}$ is:\n$$ y = C_{out}\\hat{x} \\implies C_{out} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n**3. Small-Signal Control-to-Output Transfer Function and High-Frequency Limit**\n\nThe control-to-output transfer function $G_{vd}(s) = \\hat{V}_{o}(s) / \\hat{D}(s)$ is derived with $\\hat{u}(t)=0$. The general form is $G_{vd}(s) = C_{out} (sI_{matrix} - A)^{-1} E$, where $I_{matrix}$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix.\nFirst, we find $(sI_{matrix} - A)^{-1}$:\n$$ sI_{matrix} - A = \\begin{pmatrix} s & \\frac{1-D}{L} \\\\ -\\frac{1-D}{C} & s + \\frac{1}{RC} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe determinant is $\\det(sI_{matrix} - A) = s(s + \\frac{1}{RC}) + \\frac{(1-D)^2}{LC} = s^2 + \\frac{s}{RC} + \\frac{(1-D)^2}{LC}$.\nThe inverse is:\n$$ (sI_{matrix} - A)^{-1} = \\frac{1}{s^2 + \\frac{s}{RC} + \\frac{(1-D)^2}{LC}} \\begin{pmatrix} s + \\frac{1}{RC} & -\\frac{1-D}{L} \\\\ \\frac{1-D}{C} & s \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow we compute $G_{vd}(s)$:\n$$ G_{vd}(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\det(sI_{matrix} - A)} \\begin{pmatrix} s + \\frac{1}{RC} & -\\frac{1-D}{L} \\\\ \\frac{1-D}{C} & s \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{V}{L} \\\\ -\\frac{I}{C} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ G_{vd}(s) = \\frac{1}{\\det(sI_{matrix} - A)} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} (s + \\frac{1}{RC})\\frac{V}{L} + \\frac{I(1-D)}{LC} \\\\ \\frac{V(1-D)}{LC} - \\frac{sI}{C} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ G_{vd}(s) = \\frac{\\frac{V(1-D)}{LC} - \\frac{sI}{C}}{s^2 + \\frac{s}{RC} + \\frac{(1-D)^2}{LC}} $$\nWe are asked to compute the limit $\\lim_{s \\to \\infty} s \\, G_{vd}(s)$.\n$$ s \\, G_{vd}(s) = \\frac{s \\left( \\frac{V(1-D)}{LC} - \\frac{sI}{C} \\right) }{s^2 + \\frac{s}{RC} + \\frac{(1-D)^2}{LC}} = \\frac{-\\frac{s^2 I}{C} + \\frac{s V(1-D)}{LC}}{s^2 + \\frac{s}{RC} + \\frac{(1-D)^2}{LC}} $$\nTo evaluate the limit as $s \\to \\infty$, we divide the numerator and denominator by the highest power of $s$, which is $s^2$:\n$$ \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} s \\, G_{vd}(s) = \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} \\frac{-\\frac{I}{C} + \\frac{V(1-D)}{sLC}}{1 + \\frac{1}{sRC} + \\frac{(1-D)^2}{s^2LC}} $$\nAs $s \\to \\infty$, terms with $s$ in the denominator go to zero.\n$$ \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} s \\, G_{vd}(s) = \\frac{-\\frac{I}{C} + 0}{1 + 0 + 0} = -\\frac{I}{C} $$\nThis result can be physically interpreted as the initial rate of change of the output voltage perturbation, $\\dot{\\hat{v}}_o(0^+)$, in response to a unit step change in the duty ratio $\\hat{d}(t)$. From the linearized state equations, $\\dot{\\hat{v}}_o = \\frac{1-D}{C}\\hat{i}_L - \\frac{1}{RC}\\hat{v}_o - \\frac{I}{C}\\hat{d}$. At $t=0^+$, the state variables $\\hat{i}_L$ and $\\hat{v}_o$ are still zero, so $\\dot{\\hat{v}}_o(0^+) = -\\frac{I}{C}\\hat{d}(0^+)$, which confirms the result for a unit step $\\hat{d}(0^+)=1$.\n\n**4. Normalized Scalar Sign**\n\nThe problem asks for the normalized scalar $\\Lambda$:\n$$ \\Lambda = \\frac{1}{I/C} \\,\\lim_{s \\to \\infty} s \\, G_{vd}(s) $$\nSubstituting the value of the limit we found:\n$$ \\Lambda = \\frac{1}{I/C} \\left( -\\frac{I}{C} \\right) = -1 $$\nThe sign of the high-frequency limit is negative. The normalized scalar value is $-1$.",
