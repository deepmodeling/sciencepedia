            "problem": "Consider an ideal, isolated push-pull direct current to direct current converter with a center-tapped secondary feeding a single inductor-capacitor output filter and a resistive load. The two primary switches are driven complementarily with zero overlap and equal duty cycle $D$ per switch over a switching period $T_s$, so the total fraction of the period during which either primary switch conducts is $2D$. The converter operates in Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM), meaning the output inductor current $i_L(t)$ is strictly positive and does not reach zero. Assume the transformer is ideal with negligible copper and core losses, negligible magnetizing current compared to the reflected load current, and negligible leakage inductance. Let the primary be excited from a constant input source $V_{in}$. Define the effective per-half turns ratio $n$ as $n = N_{s,\\text{half}} / N_p$, so the magnitude of the rectified secondary voltage delivered to the output filter during a conduction interval is $n V_{in}$. The two secondary diodes form a full-wave rectifier such that both conduction intervals deliver positive voltage of equal magnitude to the same output node. Assume all semiconductor forward drops are negligible, the filter capacitor is large enough that the output voltage ripple is small, and there is finite but sufficiently small dead time such that $2D \\leq 1$.\n\nStarting from the fundamental relation for an inductor $v_L(t) = L \\, \\frac{d i_L(t)}{dt}$ and the steady-state volt-second balance condition $\\int_{0}^{T_s} v_L(t) \\, dt = 0$ for periodic operation, derive a closed-form expression for the steady output voltage $V_o$ as a function of the duty cycle $D$, the effective per-half turns ratio $n$, and the input voltage $V_{in}$.\n\nExpress your final answer as a single analytic expression.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of power electronics, is well-posed, and uses objective, unambiguous language. It presents a standard, ideal model of a push-pull converter, providing all necessary parameters and assumptions to derive the requested voltage transfer function. The problem is a formalizable exercise in applying fundamental circuit theory, specifically the principle of inductor volt-second balance in a periodic steady-state system.\n\nWe begin the derivation from the fundamental principles as requested. The converter is in steady-state operation, which implies that the net change in the inductor's stored energy over one full switching period, $T_s$, is zero. For an inductor, this is equivalent to the volt-second balance condition, which states that the time integral of the voltage across the inductor over one period must be zero.\n$$ \\int_{0}^{T_s} v_L(t) \\, dt = 0 $$\nThe voltage across the output inductor, $v_L(t)$, is the difference between the voltage at the input of the filter, which we denote as the rectified voltage $v_{rect}(t)$, and the output voltage $V_o$. The problem assumes the output capacitor is large, so the output voltage can be treated as a constant DC value, $V_o$.\n$$ v_L(t) = v_{rect}(t) - V_o $$\nThe operation of the push-pull converter over one switching period $T_s$ determines the waveform of $v_{rect}(t)$. The two primary switches, $S_1$ and $S_2$, are driven for a duration of $D T_s$ each, in separate half-periods. Let $S_1$ be active for $t \\in [0, D T_s]$ and $S_2$ be active for $t \\in [T_s/2, T_s/2 + D T_s]$.\n\nWhen a primary switch is on (e.g., $S_1$ for $t \\in [0, D T_s]$), the input voltage $V_{in}$ is applied across one half of the primary winding. Due to the ideal transformer action with an effective turns ratio $n$, a voltage of magnitude $n V_{in}$ is induced in the corresponding secondary half-winding. This voltage forward-biases one of the secondary diodes, applying $n V_{in}$ to the input of the LC filter. Thus, $v_{rect}(t) = n V_{in}$.\n\nWhen both primary switches are off (e.g., for $t \\in [D T_s, T_s/2]$), no voltage is induced in the secondary. The inductor current, being continuous (CCM operation), freewheels through both secondary diodes and the center-tapped secondary winding, effectively shorting the input of the LC filter. Therefore, assuming ideal diodes, $v_{rect}(t) = 0$.\n\nThe waveform of $v_{rect}(t)$ is periodic with a fundamental period of $T_s/2$. Due to this symmetry, it is sufficient to apply the volt-second balance over one half-period, from $t=0$ to $t=T_s/2$.\n$$ \\int_{0}^{T_s/2} v_L(t) \\, dt = 0 $$\n$$ \\int_{0}^{T_s/2} (v_{rect}(t) - V_o) \\, dt = 0 $$\nWe can separate this integral into two parts corresponding to the two intervals within the half-period:\n1.  For $t \\in [0, D T_s]$: A primary switch is ON. $v_{rect}(t) = n V_{in}$. The inductor voltage is $v_L(t) = n V_{in} - V_o$.\n2.  For $t \\in (D T_s, T_s/2]$: Both primary switches are OFF. $v_{rect}(t) = 0$. The inductor voltage is $v_L(t) = 0 - V_o = -V_o$.\n\nWe can now write the volt-second balance equation for the half-period:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{D T_s} (n V_{in} - V_o) \\, dt + \\int_{D T_s}^{T_s/2} (-V_o) \\, dt = 0 $$\nSince the integrands are constant over their respective intervals, we can evaluate the integrals by multiplying the constant value by the duration of the interval.\nThe first integral is:\n$$ (n V_{in} - V_o) \\cdot (D T_s - 0) = (n V_{in} - V_o) D T_s $$\nThe second integral is:\n$$ (-V_o) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{T_s}{2} - D T_s\\right) = -V_o \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - D\\right) T_s $$\nSubstituting these back into the balance equation:\n$$ (n V_{in} - V_o) D T_s - V_o \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - D\\right) T_s = 0 $$\nThe switching period $T_s$ is a non-zero common factor and can be cancelled from the equation:\n$$ (n V_{in} - V_o) D - V_o \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - D\\right) = 0 $$\nWe now solve for $V_o$ by expanding the terms:\n$$ n D V_{in} - D V_o - \\frac{1}{2} V_o + D V_o = 0 $$\nThe terms $-D V_o$ and $+D V_o$ cancel each other, simplifying the expression significantly:\n$$ n D V_{in} - \\frac{1}{2} V_o = 0 $$\nRearranging the equation to isolate $V_o$ yields the final closed-form expression:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} V_o = n D V_{in} $$\n$$ V_o = 2 D n V_{in} $$\nThis expression gives the steady-state output voltage $V_o$ as a function of the per-switch duty cycle $D$, the effective per-half turns ratio $n$, and the input voltage $V_{in}$, as required.",

Consider the portion of the magnetic field external to the high-permeability core that is localized in the dielectric spaces between windings, and approximate each winding layer as an infinitely wide current sheet of width $w$ and negligible thickness. The mean overlap length of the windings along the core window is $l_{m}$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the reduction factor in primary-referred leakage inductance when changing a transformer's winding from a non-interleaved to a one-fold interleaved configuration. The derivation must be based on fundamental principles of magnetostatics.\n\nThe leakage inductance $L_{\\ell}$ is related to the magnetic energy $U_{m}$ stored in the leakage field by the expression $U_{m} = \\frac{1}{2} L_{\\ell} I^{2}$, where $I$ is the current to which the inductance is referred. In this problem, we need the primary-referred leakage inductance, so we use the primary current $I_{p}$.

The problem states that the leakage field is confined to the insulation regions between windings. The insulation material has permeability $\\mu \\approx \\mu_{0}$. The windings are modeled as infinitely wide current sheets of negligible thickness.\n\nWe will analyze the two configurations separately. Let the windings be parallel to the $yz$-plane, with width $w$ in the $z$-direction and mean magnetic path length $l_{m}$ in the $y$-direction. The separation between windings is along the $x$-axis.\n\nFirst, we must determine the magnetic field strength $H$ in the insulation gap(s) for each configuration using Ampère’s circuital law, $\\oint \\mathbf{H} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = I_{\\mathrm{enc}}$. An infinitely wide sheet with uniform surface current density $\\mathbf{K}$ (in units of A/m) produces a magnetic field of magnitude $H = |\\mathbf{K}|/2$ on either side, with the direction given by the right-hand rule.\n\nThe problem states the ampere-turn balance $N_{p} I_{p} = N_{s} I_{s}$. The total current in the primary winding is $N_{p}I_{p}$ and in the secondary is $N_{s}I_{s}$. These currents are distributed over a width $w$. The equivalent surface current density magnitude for the full primary winding is $K_{p} = \\frac{N_{p}I_{p}}{w}$, and for the full secondary winding is $K_{s} = \\frac{N_{s}I_{s}}{w}$. Due to the ampere-turn balance, $K_{p} = K_{s}$. Let's denote this magnitude as $K = \\frac{N_{p}I_{p}}{w}$. The currents flow in opposite directions.\n\n**1. Non-Interleaved Configuration (P–S)**\n\nIn this configuration, we have a single primary block and a single secondary block separated by one insulation gap of thickness $t_{\\mathrm{ins}}$. We model this as two parallel current sheets. Let the primary sheet be at $x=0$ with current density $\\mathbf{K}_{p} = K\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, and the secondary sheet at $x=t_{\\mathrm{ins}}$ with $\\mathbf{K}_{s} = -K\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$.\n\nApplying the principle of superposition for two parallel sheets with opposite currents:\n- The field from the primary sheet ($x=0$) is $\\mathbf{H}_{p} = -\\frac{K}{2}\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ for $x>0$ and $\\mathbf{H}_{p} = \\frac{K}{2}\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ for $x<0$.\n- The field from the secondary sheet ($x=t_{\\mathrm{ins}}$) is $\\mathbf{H}_{s} = \\frac{-K}{2}(-\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) = \\frac{K}{2}\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ for $x>t_{\\mathrm{ins}}$ and $\\mathbf{H}_{s} = -\\frac{-K}{2}(-\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) = -\\frac{K}{2}\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ for $x<t_{\\mathrm{ins}}$.\n\nThe total field $\\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{H}_{p} + \\mathbf{H}_{s}$ is:\n- For $x<0$: $\\mathbf{H} = \\frac{K}{2}\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} - \\frac{K}{2}\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} = 0$.\n- For $0 < x < t_{\\mathrm{ins}}$: $\\mathbf{H} = -\\frac{K}{2}\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} - \\frac{K}{2}\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} = -K\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$.\n- For $x>t_{\\mathrm{ins}}$: $\\mathbf{H} = -\\frac{K}{2}\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + \\frac{K}{2}\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} = 0$.\n\nThe magnetic field is confined to the insulation gap and has a uniform magnitude:\n$$H_{\\mathrm{non\\text{-}interleaved}} = K = \\frac{N_{p}I_{p}}{w}$$\nThe magnetic energy density in this gap is:\n$$u_{\\mathrm{non\\text{-}interleaved}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_{0}H_{\\mathrm{non\\text{-}interleaved}}^{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_{0}\\left(\\frac{N_{p}I_{p}}{w}\\right)^{2}$$\nThe volume of the insulation gap is $V_{\\mathrm{gap}} = l_{m} w t_{\\mathrm{ins}}$. The total stored magnetic energy is:\n$$U_{m, \\mathrm{non\\text{-}interleaved}} = u_{\\mathrm{non\\text{-}interleaved}} \\cdot V_{\\mathrm{gap}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_{0}\\left(\\frac{N_{p}I_{p}}{w}\\right)^{2} (l_{m} w t_{\\mathrm{ins}}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_{0}\\frac{N_{p}^{2}I_{p}^{2}l_{m}t_{\\mathrm{ins}}}{w}$$\nThe primary-referred leakage inductance is therefore:\n$$L_{\\ell, \\mathrm{non\\text{-}interleaved}} = \\frac{2U_{m, \\mathrm{non\\text{-}interleaved}}}{I_{p}^{2}} = \\mu_{0}\\frac{N_{p}^{2}l_{m}t_{\\mathrm{ins}}}{w}$$\n\n**2. One-Fold Interleaved Configuration (P/2–S–P/2)**\n\nHere, the primary winding is split into two halves, each with $N_{p}/2$ turns, placed on either side of the secondary winding. This creates two insulation gaps, each of thickness $t_{\\mathrm{ins}}$. We model this as three current sheets:\n- P/2 sheet at $x=0$: current density $\\mathbf{K}_{1} = \\frac{(N_{p}/2)I_{p}}{w}\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} = \\frac{K}{2}\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$.\n- S sheet at $x=t_{\\mathrm{ins}}$: current density $\\mathbf{K}_{2} = -\\frac{N_{p}I_{p}}{w}\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} = -K\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$.\n- P/2 sheet at $x=2t_{\\mathrm{ins}}$: current density $\\mathbf{K}_{3} = \\frac{(N_{p}/2)I_{p}}{w}\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} = \\frac{K}{2}\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$.\n\nWe apply Ampère's law to find the field in each gap. The total enclosed current for a loop surrounding all three sheets is zero, so the field is zero for $x<0$ and $x>2t_{\\mathrm{ins}}$.\n\nFor the first gap ($0 < x < t_{\\mathrm{ins}}$), an Amperian loop enclosing only the first sheet gives:\n$$H_{1} = |\\mathbf{K}_{1}| = \\frac{K}{2} = \\frac{N_{p}I_{p}}{2w}$$\nFor the second gap ($t_{\\mathrm{ins}} < x < 2t_{\\mathrm{ins}}$), an Amperian loop enclosing the first two sheets gives an enclosed current density of $\\mathbf{K}_{1}+\\mathbf{K}_{2} = \\frac{K}{2}\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} - K\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} = -\\frac{K}{2}\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. The magnitude of the field is:\n$$H_{2} = |\\mathbf{K}_{1}+\\mathbf{K}_{2}| = \\frac{K}{2} = \\frac{N_{p}I_{p}}{2w}$$\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field is the same in both gaps:\n$$H_{\\mathrm{interleaved}} = \\frac{N_{p}I_{p}}{2w}$$\nThis field is half the magnitude of the field in the non-interleaved case. The energy density in each gap is:\n$$u_{\\mathrm{interleaved}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_{0}H_{\\mathrm{interleaved}}^{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_{0}\\left(\\frac{N_{p}I_{p}}{2w}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{1}{8}\\mu_{0}\\left(\\frac{N_{p}I_{p}}{w}\\right)^{2}$$\nThere are two such gaps, each with volume $V_{\\mathrm{gap}} = l_{m} w t_{\\mathrm{ins}}$. The total stored energy is the sum of the energies in the two gaps:\n$$U_{m, \\mathrm{interleaved}} = 2 \\cdot (u_{\\mathrm{interleaved}} \\cdot V_{\\mathrm{gap}}) = 2 \\cdot \\left[ \\frac{1}{8}\\mu_{0}\\left(\\frac{N_{p}I_{p}}{w}\\right)^{2} (l_{m} w t_{\\mathrm{ins}}) \\right] = \\frac{1}{4}\\mu_{0}\\frac{N_{p}^{2}I_{p}^{2}l_{m}t_{\\mathrm{ins}}}{w}$$\nThe primary-referred leakage inductance for the interleaved configuration is:\n$$L_{\\ell, \\mathrm{interleaved}} = \\frac{2U_{m, \\mathrm{interleaved}}}{I_{p}^{2}} = \\frac{2}{I_{p}^{2}} \\left( \\frac{1}{4}\\mu_{0}\\frac{N_{p}^{2}I_{p}^{2}l_{m}t_{\\mathrm{ins}}}{w} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_{0}\\frac{N_{p}^{2}l_{m}t_{\\mathrm{ins}}}{w}$$\n\n**3. Reduction Factor**\n\nThe reduction factor $r$ is the ratio of the interleaved leakage inductance to the non-interleaved leakage inductance:\n$$r = \\frac{L_{\\ell, \\mathrm{interleaved}}}{L_{\\ell, \\mathrm{non\\text{-}interleaved}}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}\\mu_{0}\\frac{N_{p}^{2}l_{m}t_{\\mathrm{ins}}}{w}}{\\mu_{0}\\frac{N_{p}^{2}l_{m}t_{\\mathrm{ins}}}{w}}$$\nAll physical and geometric parameters cancel out, leaving:\n$$r = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThis result is based on the key physical changes: interleaving halves the magnetomotive force (MMF) across each leakage gap, which reduces the energy density by a factor of four ($H^{2}$). However, it doubles the volume of the region containing the leakage field. The net effect is a reduction in total stored energy, and thus leakage inductance, by a factor of two.",

Its transfer function is of the form $G_c(s) = K \\frac{1+s/\\omega_z}{s(1+s/\\omega_p')}$.\n\nA standard strategy to achieve a wide bandwidth and good phase margin is as follows:\n1.  **Place the compensator zero $\\omega_z$ to cancel the plant pole $\\omega_p$**: Set $\\omega_z = \\omega_p = 1/(R_{\\min}C)$. This cancellation turns the plant-compensator combination into an integrator followed by a high-frequency pole, simplifying the dynamics around crossover.\n2.  **Place the compensator pole $\\omega_p'$ to set the phase margin**: After the zero-pole cancellation, the loop gain behaves as $T(s) \\propto \\frac{1}{s(1+s/\\omega_p')}$. The phase of this system at an angular frequency $\\omega$ is $\\phi(\\omega) = -90^\\circ - \\arctan(\\omega/\\omega_p')$. To achieve a phase margin of $PM = 60^\\circ$ at the crossover frequency $\\omega_c$, the phase must be $\\phi(\\omega_c) = -180^\\circ + 60^\\circ = -120^\\circ$.\n    $$\n    -120^\\circ = -90^\\circ - \\arctan(\\omega_c/\\omega_p') \\implies \\arctan(\\omega_c/\\omega_p') = 30^\\circ\n    $$\n    This gives the required placement for the compensator pole:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\omega_c}{\\omega_p'} = \\tan(30^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\implies \\omega_p' = \\omega_c \\sqrt{3}\n    $$\n3.  **Determine the required compensator gain at crossover**: The overall loop gain magnitude must be unity at the crossover frequency: $|T(j\\omega_c)| = 1$. Let the required compensator gain magnitude at $\\omega_c$ be denoted $K_c = |G_c(j\\omega_c)|$.\n    $$\n    |T(j\\omega_c)| = \\beta \\cdot |G_c(j\\omega_c)| \\cdot |G_{vc}(j\\omega_c)| = 1\n    $$\n    Solving for $K_c$:\n    $$\n    K_c = \\frac{1}{\\beta \\cdot |G_{vc}(j\\omega_c)|} = \\frac{1}{\\beta \\left| g_m \\frac{R_{\\min}}{1+j\\omega_c R_{\\min}C} \\right|} = \\frac{|1+j\\omega_c R_{\\min}C|}{\\beta g_m R_{\\min}}\n    $$\n    This expression shows how the compensator gain $K_c$ required at crossover is determined by the parameters of the plant and the feedback network to satisfy the magnitude condition $|T(j\\omega_c)|=1$. It can be written in terms of the plant pole $\\omega_p$:\n    $$\n    K_c = \\frac{\\sqrt{1+(\\omega_c/\\omega_p)^2}}{\\beta g_m R_{\\min}}\n    $$\nThis completes the outline of the compensator design logic. The primary answer required by the problem is the numerical value for $C_{\\min}$.",
