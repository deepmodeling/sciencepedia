These are well-established principles in electrical engineering. The setup is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary parameters ($V_o, D, f_s, L_o$) and idealizations to derive a unique analytical expression for the current ripple. It is self-contained and unambiguous.\n- **Objective:** The language is formal and technical. It is free of subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the validation checklist. It is a standard, well-defined problem in power electronics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation\nThe objective is to determine the peak-to-peak ripple of the current in the output inductor, $\\Delta i_{L_o}$. This ripple is a direct consequence of the voltage applied across the inductor during the switching cycle. The fundamental constitutive relation for an inductor is $v_L(t) = L \\frac{di_L}{dt}$. By integrating this over a time interval $\\Delta t$ during which the voltage $v_L$ is constant, the change in inductor current $\\Delta i_L$ is given by:\n$$ \\Delta i_L = \\frac{v_L \\Delta t}{L} $$\nWe will analyze the voltage across the output inductor, $v_{L_o}(t)$, during the two distinct sub-intervals of a switching period $T_s$. The converter operates in steady state, which implies that the net change in inductor current over a full period is zero. This is the principle of volt-second balance, stating that the time-integral of the voltage across an inductor over one period is zero:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{T_s} v_{L_o}(t) dt = 0 $$\n\nLet the controlled switch be ON for a time interval $DT_s$ and OFF for $(1-D)T_s$.\n\n**1. Switch is ON (Interval $0 < t \\leq DT_s$)**\n\nWhen the main switch is ON (closed), it provides a path to ground. The diode in the circuit is reverse-biased and does not conduct. The energy transfer capacitor, $C_c$, which holds a constant DC voltage $V_{C_c}$ (due to the ideal assumption of infinite capacitance), is connected in series with the output inductor $L_o$ and the load, which has a constant voltage $V_o$. Applying Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) to the output loop, we have:\n$$ V_{C_c} - v_{L_o}(t) - V_o = 0 $$\nTherefore, the voltage across the output inductor during this interval is:\n$$ v_{L_o}(t) = V_{C_c} - V_o $$\n\n**2. Switch is OFF (Interval $DT_s < t \\leq T_s$)**\n\nWhen the main switch is OFF (open), the inductor currents find alternative paths. The diode becomes forward-biased and conducts, providing a path to ground for the node between capacitor $C_c$ and inductor $L_o$. Assuming an ideal diode with zero forward voltage drop, this node is held at ground potential ($0$ V). The output inductor $L_o$ is connected between this node (at $0$ V) and the output node (at $V_o$). The voltage across the output inductor is therefore:\n$$ v_{L_o}(t) = 0 - V_o = -V_o $$\n\n**3. Application of Volt-Second Balance**\n\nNow, we apply the volt-second balance principle to the output inductor $L_o$ over one full switching period $T_s$:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{T_s} v_{L_o}(t) dt = \\int_{0}^{DT_s} (V_{C_c} - V_o) dt + \\int_{DT_s}^{T_s} (-V_o) dt = 0 $$\nSince $V_{C_c}$ and $V_o$ are constant DC values over the period, the integration is straightforward:\n$$ (V_{C_c} - V_o) (DT_s) + (-V_o) ((1-D)T_s) = 0 $$\nWe can divide by $T_s$ (since $T_s \\neq 0$):\n$$ D(V_{C_c} - V_o) - V_o(1-D) = 0 $$\n$$ DV_{C_c} - DV_o - V_o + DV_o = 0 $$\n$$ DV_{C_c} = V_o $$\nThis gives us a crucial relationship for the voltage across the energy transfer capacitor:\n$$ V_{C_c} = \\frac{V_o}{D} $$\n\n**4. Calculation of the Current Ripple**\n\nThe peak-to-peak ripple of the inductor current, $\\Delta i_{L_o}$, is the magnitude of the change in current during either the ON or OFF sub-interval. Let's calculate it using the OFF interval, as the expression for the voltage is simpler.\nDuring the OFF interval (duration $\\Delta t = (1-D)T_s$), the voltage across the inductor is $v_{L_o} = -V_o$. The change in current is:\n$$ \\Delta i_{L_o, \\text{off}} = \\frac{v_{L_o} \\Delta t}{L_o} = \\frac{(-V_o)(1-D)T_s}{L_o} $$\nThe peak-to-peak ripple is the absolute value of this change:\n$$ \\Delta i_{L_o} = \\left| \\frac{-V_o(1-D)T_s}{L_o} \\right| = \\frac{V_o(1-D)T_s}{L_o} $$\nTo verify, let's calculate the ripple during the ON interval (duration $\\Delta t = DT_s$), where $v_{L_o} = V_{C_c} - V_o$. Substituting $V_{C_c} = V_o/D$:\n$$ v_{L_o} = \\frac{V_o}{D} - V_o = V_o \\left(\\frac{1}{D} - 1\\right) = V_o \\frac{1-D}{D} $$\nThe change in current during this interval is:\n$$ \\Delta i_{L_o, \\text{on}} = \\frac{v_{L_o} \\Delta t}{L_o} = \\frac{\\left( V_o \\frac{1-D}{D} \\right)(DT_s)}{L_o} = \\frac{V_o(1-D)T_s}{L_o} $$\nThe results match, as expected from the volt-second balance principle. The inductor current increases by this amount during the ON-time and decreases by the same amount during the OFF-time.\n\nThe final step is to express the result in terms of the switching frequency $f_s$, by substituting $T_s = \\frac{1}{f_s}$:\n$$ \\Delta i_{L_o} = \\frac{V_o(1-D)}{L_o f_s} $$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the peak-to-peak ripple of the output inductor current for an ideal non-inverting Zeta converter in CCM.",

The derivation starts from the fundamental capacitor constitutive relation:\n$$i_C(t) = C \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_C(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}$$\nFor the energy transfer capacitor $C_T$, this is:\n$$i_{C_T}(t) = C_T \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{C_T}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}$$\nThe change in voltage across the capacitor over a time interval $[t_1, t_2]$ is found by integrating this relation:\n$$\\Delta v_{C_T} = v_{C_T}(t_2) - v_{C_T}(t_1) = \\frac{1}{C_T} \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} i_{C_T}(t) \\mathrm{d}t$$\nWe analyze the current $i_{C_T}(t)$ in an ideal Ćuk converter operating in CCM over one switching period $T_s$. The period is divided into two intervals:\n1.  Interval 1 (Switch ON): For a duration $DT_s$, the power switch is closed and the diode is open (reverse-biased). During this time, the capacitor $C_T$ is connected to the output stage and discharges. The current flowing out of its positive terminal is the output inductor current. Under the small ripple approximation, this current is constant and equal to its average value, $I_{L2}$. Therefore, the current flowing into the capacitor is:\n    $$i_{C_T}(t) = -I_{L2} \\quad \\text{for } 0 < t \\le DT_s$$\n2.  Interval 2 (Switch OFF): For a duration $(1-D)T_s$, the power switch is open and the diode is closed (forward-biased). The input inductor current $I_{L1}$ flows through the diode to charge the capacitor $C_T$. Under the small ripple approximation, this current is constant and equal to its average value, $I_{L1}$. Therefore, the current flowing into the capacitor is:\n    $$i_{C_T}(t) = I_{L1} \\quad \\text{for } DT_s < t \\le T_s$$\n\nThe peak-to-peak voltage ripple, which we denote as $\\Delta V_{C_T}$, is the magnitude of the voltage change during either of these intervals. Let us calculate this change during the first interval, from $t=0$ to $t=DT_s$, where the capacitor voltage decreases from its peak value to its minimum value.\n$$\\Delta V_{C_T} = |v_{C_T}(DT_s) - v_{C_T}(0)| = \\left| \\frac{1}{C_T} \\int_{0}^{DT_s} (-I_{L2}) \\mathrm{d}t \\right|$$\nSince $I_{L2}$ is treated as constant, the integration is straightforward:\n$$\\Delta V_{C_T} = \\left| -\\frac{I_{L2}}{C_T} [t]_0^{DT_s} \\right| = \\left| -\\frac{I_{L2} D T_s}{C_T} \\right| = \\frac{I_{L2} D T_s}{C_T}$$\nThe switching period $T_s$ is the inverse of the switching frequency $f_s$, so $T_s = 1/f_s$. Substituting this into the expression gives:\n$$\\Delta V_{C_T} = \\frac{I_{L2} D}{C_T f_s}$$\nThe problem states an allowable peak-to-peak voltage ripple, $\\Delta V_C$. To satisfy this constraint, the actual ripple $\\Delta V_{C_T}$ must be less than or equal to the allowable ripple:\n$$\\frac{I_{L2} D}{C_T f_s} \\le \\Delta V_C$$\nTo find the minimum required capacitance, $C_{\\min}$, we set the ripple equal to the maximum allowable value:\n$$C_T \\ge \\frac{I_{L2} D}{\\Delta V_C f_s}$$\nThus, the minimum capacitance is:\n$$C_{\\min} = \\frac{I_{L2} D}{\\Delta V_C f_s}$$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $I_{L2} = 10\\,\\text{A}$\n- $D = 0.2$\n- $\\Delta V_C = 0.25\\,\\text{V}$\n- $f_s = 200 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\text{Hz}$\n\n$$C_{\\min} = \\frac{(10) \\times (0.2)}{(0.25) \\times (200 \\times 10^{3})}$$\n$$C_{\\min} = \\frac{2}{50 \\times 10^{3}} = \\frac{2}{5 \\times 10^{4}}$$\n$$C_{\\min} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{F} = 4 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{F}$$\nThe problem requires the answer in farads, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$C_{\\min} = 4.000 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{F}$$",
