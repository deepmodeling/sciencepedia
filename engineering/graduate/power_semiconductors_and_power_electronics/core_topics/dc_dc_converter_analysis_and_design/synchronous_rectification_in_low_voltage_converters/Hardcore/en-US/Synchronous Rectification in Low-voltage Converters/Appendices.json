It is a well-formed problem in the field of power electronics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution will now be derived.\n\n## SOLUTION DERIVATION\n\nThe task is to determine the correct method for measuring the body diode conduction interval during the turn-on transition of the low-side synchronous rectifier (SR) MOSFET and to compute its duration. This interval is also known as the effective dead-time. We must analyze the sequence of events based on the provided physical principles and waveform data.\n\n**Sequence of Events during SR Turn-On:**\n\n1.  **Start of the Transition**: The high-side MOSFET turns off. To maintain continuity, the inductor current $i_L$ (which is flowing out of the switching node into the inductor) requires a new path to ground.\n2.  **Dead-Time and Body Diode Conduction (Start)**: The control signals for both high-side and low-side MOSFETs are low. The inductor current $i_L$, which cannot change instantaneously, forces its way through the only available path: the body diode of the low-side MOSFET, in the forward-biased direction (from ground to the switching node/drain). This clamps the drain-source voltage of the low-side FET, $V_{\\text{DS,LS}}$, to approximately the negative of the diode's forward voltage drop, i.e., $V_{\\text{DS,LS}} \\approx -V_{F}$. The problem states this clamping to $-0.65\\,\\mathrm{V}$ occurs at $t = t_1 = 18\\,\\mathrm{ns}$. This moment marks the **start** of body diode conduction.\n3.  **Gate Drive Activation**: After a programmed delay (the dead-time), the gate driver begins to apply voltage to the gate of the low-side MOSFET. The problem states that the gate-source voltage, $V_{\\text{GS,LS}}$, begins to rise from $0\\,\\mathrm{V}$ at $t = t_2 = 35\\,\\mathrm{ns}$. Between $t_1$ and $t_2$, the body diode is conducting, but the MOSFET channel is still off.\n4.  **MOSFET Channel Enhancement**: As $V_{\\text{GS,LS}}$ rises past the MOSFET's threshold voltage ($V_{\\text{th}}$), a conductive channel begins to form between the drain and source. The current $i_L$ starts to share its path between the body diode and the nascent channel.\n5.  **Miller Plateau and End of Body Diode Conduction**: For the inductor current to fully commutate from the high-resistance body diode path to the low-resistance channel path, the drain-source voltage $V_{\\text{DS,LS}}$ must transition from the diode drop ($\\approx -V_{F}$) to the much smaller ohmic drop ($\\approx -i_L R_{\\text{DS(on)}}$). This rapid change in $V_{\\text{DS}}$ causes a large current to flow through the gate-drain capacitance ($C_{GD}$), which momentarily pins the gate voltage at the Miller plateau. The problem states that at $t = t_3 = 68\\,\\mathrm{ns}$, $V_{\\text{GS,LS}}$ reaches its Miller plateau and, concurrently, $V_{\\text{DS,LS}}$ transitions from $\\approx -0.65\\,\\mathrm{V}$ to $\\approx -0.02\\,\\mathrm{V}$. This transition of $V_{\\text{DS,LS}}$ to the low ohmic drop signifies that the MOSFET channel has successfully taken over the entire inductor current. At this point, the voltage across the body diode becomes $\\approx -0.02\\,\\mathrm{V}$, which is far below its forward turn-on voltage, so the diode ceases to conduct. Therefore, $t = t_3$ marks the **end** of body diode conduction.\n\n**Calculation of the Interval:**\n\nThe body diode conduction interval is the time duration from its start to its end.\n- Start of conduction: $t_{\\text{start}} = t_1 = 18\\,\\mathrm{ns}$.\n- End of conduction: $t_{\\text{end}} = t_3 = 68\\,\\mathrm{ns}$.\n\nThe duration of body diode conduction is:\n$$ \\Delta t_{\\text{diode}} = t_{\\text{end}} - t_{\\text{start}} = t_3 - t_1 = 68\\,\\mathrm{ns} - 18\\,\\mathrm{ns} = 50\\,\\mathrm{ns} $$\nThis interval is the \"effective dead-time\" because it is the period where the circuit relies on the lossy body diode conduction ($P_{\\text{loss}} \\approx I_L V_F$) before the efficient MOSFET channel takes over ($P_{\\text{loss}} = I_L^2 R_{\\text{DS(on)}}$). Minimizing this time is a primary goal in SR control.\n\n## OPTION-BY-OPTION ANALYSIS\n\n- **Option A**: This option defines the start of body diode conduction at $t=t_1$ (when $V_{\\text{DS,LS}}$ clamps to $\\approx -V_{F}$) and the end at $t=t_3$ (when $V_{\\text{DS,LS}}$ transitions to the ohmic drop). It calculates the interval as $t_3 - t_1 = 50\\,\\mathrm{ns}$ and correctly identifies this as the effective SR dead-time. This aligns perfectly with our physics-based derivation.\n    - **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **Option B**: This option defines the start correctly at $t_1$, but defines the end at $t_2$, the moment the gate voltage begins to rise. At $t_2$, the MOSFET channel has not yet formed, and the body diode is still carrying the full inductor current. Conduction through the body diode does not end at this point. The calculation $t_2 - t_1 = 17\\,\\mathrm{ns}$ represents only the initial portion of the dead-time, not the full duration of body diode conduction.\n    - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **Option C**: This option incorrectly defines the start of body diode conduction as the time when $V_{\\text{GS,LS}}$ crosses its threshold. Body diode conduction is initiated by the inductor current immediately after the high-side switch turns off, which occurs at $t_1$, well before the gate voltage starts to rise at $t_2$. The proposed start time is physically incorrect. The numerical value of $33\\,\\mathrm{ns}$ seems to be derived from $t_3 - t_2 = 68\\,\\mathrm{ns} - 35\\,\\mathrm{ns} = 33\\,\\mathrm{ns}$, which represents the gate voltage rise time to the Miller plateau, not the body diode conduction interval.\n    - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **Option D**: This option incorrectly defines the start of body diode conduction as the time when $V_{\\text{GS,LS}}$ starts rising ($t_2$). As explained for Option C, conduction begins earlier at $t_1$. It correctly identifies the end of the *gate-rise-to-Miller* interval at $t_3$, but mislabels this interval ($t_3 - t_2 = 33\\,\\mathrm{ns}$) as the body diode conduction interval.\n    - **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

It accurately models a common design challenge in synchronous power converters. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution can be undertaken.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Inequality for $V_{th}$\n\nThe objective is to ensure that the true inductor current, $I_L(t_{\\mathrm{SR\\_on}})$, is strictly positive at the instant the Synchronous Rectifier (SR) MOSFET turns on. This instant is denoted by $t_{\\mathrm{SR\\_on}}$.\n\nLet $t=0$ be the time at which the comparator's input crosses its threshold voltage, $V_{th}$. The comparator input is the sum of the sensed voltage, $V_{\\mathrm{sense}}$, and the positive sensing error, $\\varepsilon$. At the trigger point, we have:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{sense}}(0) + \\varepsilon = V_{th}$$\nThe sensed voltage is related to the true inductor current, $I_L(0)$, by the sense resistor $R_s$:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{sense}}(0) = I_L(0) R_s$$\nSubstituting this into the comparator equation gives:\n$$I_L(0) R_s + \\varepsilon = V_{th}$$\nWe can solve for the true inductor current at the moment the comparator triggers:\n$$I_L(0) = \\frac{V_{th} - \\varepsilon}{R_s}$$\nDue to the propagation delay, $t_{pd}$, the SR MOSFET gate is not driven high until $t_{\\mathrm{SR\\_on}} = t_{pd}$. During the interval from $t=0$ to $t=t_{pd}$, the inductor current continues to freewheel through the body diode of the SR MOSFET. According to the problem statement, the voltage across the inductor, $v_L$, during this phase is approximately constant:\n$$v_L \\approx -V_F - V_o = -(V_o + V_F)$$\nUsing the fundamental inductor constitutive relation, $v_L = L \\frac{d I_L}{d t}$, we can determine the rate of change of the inductor current:\n$$\\frac{d I_L}{d t} = \\frac{v_L}{L} = -\\frac{V_o + V_F}{L}$$\nSince the rate of change is constant, the inductor current decreases linearly with time. The change in inductor current, $\\Delta I_L$, over the propagation delay interval $t_{pd}$ is:\n$$\\Delta I_L = \\int_0^{t_{pd}} \\frac{d I_L}{d t} dt = -\\frac{V_o + V_F}{L} t_{pd}$$\nThe inductor current at the instant of SR turn-on, $I_L(t_{\\mathrm{SR\\_on}})$ or $I_L(t_{pd})$, is the initial current $I_L(0)$ plus this change:\n$$I_L(t_{pd}) = I_L(0) + \\Delta I_L = I_L(0) - \\frac{V_o + V_F}{L} t_{pd}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $I_L(0)$:\n$$I_L(t_{pd}) = \\frac{V_{th} - \\varepsilon}{R_s} - \\frac{V_o + V_F}{L} t_{pd}$$\nWe must guarantee that $I_L(t_{pd})  0$ under the worst-case conditions. The worst case occurs when $I_L(t_{pd})$ is at its minimum value. This happens when the initial current $I_L(0)$ is at its minimum for a given $V_{th}$. Looking at the expression $I_L(0) = (V_{th} - \\varepsilon)/R_s$, the initial current is minimized when the positive error $\\varepsilon$ is maximized. The maximum positive error is given as $\\varepsilon_{\\max}$. Therefore, the worst-case condition corresponds to setting $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_{\\max}$.\n\nThe inequality we must satisfy becomes:\n$$\\frac{V_{th} - \\varepsilon_{\\max}}{R_s} - \\frac{V_o + V_F}{L} t_{pd}  0$$\nTo ensure this condition is always met, $V_{th}$ must be chosen appropriately. We can rearrange the inequality to solve for $V_{th}$:\n$$\\frac{V_{th} - \\varepsilon_{\\max}}{R_s}  \\frac{V_o + V_F}{L} t_{pd}$$\n$$V_{th} - \\varepsilon_{\\max}  R_s t_{pd} \\frac{V_o + V_F}{L}$$\nFinally, we arrive at the inequality for the threshold voltage $V_{th}$:\n$$V_{th}  \\varepsilon_{\\max} + R_s t_{pd} \\frac{V_o + V_F}{L}$$\nThis inequality guarantees that even with the maximum positive sensing error and accounting for the propagation delay, the SR MOSFET will turn on only when the inductor current is still positive.\n\n### Part 2: Evaluation of the Minimum Threshold Voltage $V_{th,\\min}$\n\nThe minimum threshold voltage, $V_{th,\\min}$, is the value that makes the two sides of the derived inequality equal:\n$$V_{th,\\min} = \\varepsilon_{\\max} + R_s t_{pd} \\frac{V_o + V_F}{L}$$\nWe are given the following parameter values:\n$V_o = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n$V_F = 0.7\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n$L = 220\\,\\mathrm{nH} = 220 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{H}$\n$R_s = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{m}\\Omega = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\Omega$\n$t_{pd} = 60\\,\\mathrm{ns} = 60 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n$\\varepsilon_{\\max} = 2.2\\,\\mathrm{mV} = 2.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the term related to the current decay during the propagation delay:\n$$R_s t_{pd} \\frac{V_o + V_F}{L} = (1.5 \\times 10^{-3}) (60 \\times 10^{-9}) \\frac{1.2 + 0.7}{220 \\times 10^{-9}}$$\n$$= (1.5 \\times 10^{-3}) (60) \\frac{1.9}{220}$$\n$$= (90 \\times 10^{-3}) \\frac{1.9}{220}$$\n$$= (90 \\times 10^{-3}) (0.00863636...)$$\n$$= 0.0007772727...\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nThis corresponds to $0.7772727...\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n\nNow, we add the maximum error term $\\varepsilon_{\\max}$:\n$$V_{th,\\min} = (2.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}) + (0.0007772727...\\,\\mathrm{V})$$\n$$V_{th,\\min} = 0.0029772727...\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nConverting this to millivolts gives:\n$$V_{th,\\min} = 2.9772727...\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$V_{th,\\min} \\approx 2.977\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\n\n### Part 3: Physical Consequences of Violated Condition\n\nThe condition to be satisfied is $I_L(t_{\\mathrm{SR\\_on}})  0$. If this condition is violated, it means the synchronous rectifier (SR) MOSFET is turned on when the inductor current is zero or has already reversed direction ($I_L \\le 0$). This occurs in Discontinuous Conduction Mode (DCM) at light loads, where the inductor current naturally decays to zero during the freewheeling phase.\n\nThe physical consequences arise from the bidirectional nature of a MOSFET when its channel is enhanced. When the SR MOSFET turns on, it connects the switching node to ground through its low on-resistance, $R_{\\text{DS(on)}}$.\n\n1.  **Reverse Current Flow:** With the SR MOSFET on, the voltage at the switching node is approximately $0\\,\\mathrm{V}$. The voltage across the inductor is $v_L = V_{sw} - V_o \\approx 0 - V_o = -V_o$. This large negative voltage, according to $L \\frac{dI_L}{dt} = v_L$, causes a current to ramp up in the negative direction. This current flows from the output capacitor and/or the load, back through the inductor, through the SR MOSFET, and into ground.\n\n2.  **Efficiency Degradation:** Instead of delivering power to the load, the converter starts drawing power *from* the output. This reverse current represents a significant power loss, as energy stored in the output capacitor is dissipated as heat, primarily in the SR MOSFET's $R_{\\text{DS(on)}}$ and the inductor's winding resistance. At light loads, this loss mechanism can be substantial and severely degrade the converter's efficiency. Correctly timing the SR turn-off (zero-current detection) is critical for achieving high efficiency at light loads.\n\n3.  **Output Voltage Regulation:** The reverse current drains charge from the output capacitor, causing the output voltage $V_o$ to droop. This compromises the DC voltage regulation, especially under light or no-load conditions. The main control loop will have to compensate, but the transient effect is a degradation of output quality.\n\nIn essence, mistiming the SR turn-on to occur when $I_L \\le 0$ forces the buck converter to momentarily operate as a boost converter in reverse, pulling energy from the output, which is antithetical to its purpose and detrimental to its performance.",

Assume ideal behavior for the high-side switch and inductor, negligible current ripple relative to the direct current, and negligible reverse-recovery effects.\n\nTwo MOSFET candidates are being considered for the synchronous rectifier:\n- Device A: $R_{\\mathrm{DS(on)}} = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{m}\\Omega$, total gate charge $Q_{g} = 80\\,\\mathrm{nC}$ at $V_{\\mathrm{GS}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{V}$, output capacitance $C_{oss} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{nF}$, unit price $\\$1.40$.\n- Device B: $R_{\\mathrm{DS(on)}} = 3.5\\,\\mathrm{m}\\Omega$, total gate charge $Q_{g} = 45\\,\\mathrm{nC}$ at $V_{\\mathrm{GS}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{V}$, output capacitance $C_{oss} = 0.7\\,\\mathrm{nF}$, unit price $\\$0.85$.\n\nLet the steady duty ratio be $D \\approx V_{\\mathrm{out}}/V_{\\mathrm{in}}$, and let the output current be a constant $I$. The low-side MOSFET conducts during the fraction $(1-D)$ of each period. Using only fundamental definitions (power as energy per cycle times frequency, conduction loss as $I^{2}R$, energy to charge a capacitor as $\\frac{1}{2} C V^{2}$, and gate-drive energy per cycle as $Q_{g} V_{\\mathrm{GS}}$), derive a weighted selection criterion in the form of a scalar score $S$ that combines conduction and switching losses and price:\n$$S = w_{c} P_{\\mathrm{cond}} + w_{s} P_{\\mathrm{sw}} + w_{p}\\,\\mathrm{Price},$$\nwhere $w_{c}$ and $w_{s}$ weight conduction and switching losses, respectively, and $w_{p}$ is a penalty coefficient in units of $\\mathrm{W}/\\mathrm{\\$}$ that maps device price to an equivalent performance penalty.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. The parameters and operating conditions are realistic for a low-voltage synchronous buck converter. The requested derivation is based on fundamental principles of power electronics. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe task is to find the threshold output current $I^{\\star}$ at which two different MOSFETs, A and B, are considered equivalent when used as the synchronous rectifier in a buck converter. The equivalence is defined by equating a weighted score $S$ that incorporates conduction losses, switching losses, and device price.\n\nFirst, we must derive the expressions for the power losses for a generic low-side MOSFET based on the provided definitions. The converter operates at a switching frequency $f_{\\mathrm{sw}}$ and a duty ratio $D$. The low-side MOSFET conducts for a fraction of the period given by $(1-D)$.\n\n1.  **Conduction Loss ($P_{\\mathrm{cond}}$)**\n    The problem specifies that the output current is a constant $I$, a consequence of the assumption of negligible current ripple. The low-side MOSFET conducts this current $I$ for a time duration of $(1-D)T_{\\mathrm{sw}}$ in each switching period $T_{\\mathrm{sw}} = 1/f_{\\mathrm{sw}}$. The instantaneous power dissipated during this conduction interval is $I^{2}R_{\\mathrm{DS(on)}}$. The energy loss per cycle due to conduction, $E_{\\mathrm{cond}}$, is this power multiplied by the conduction time:\n    $$E_{\\mathrm{cond}} = (I^{2}R_{\\mathrm{DS(on)}}) \\times (1-D)T_{\\mathrm{sw}}$$\n    The average conduction power loss, $P_{\\mathrm{cond}}$, is the energy loss per cycle multiplied by the switching frequency:\n    $$P_{\\mathrm{cond}} = E_{\\mathrm{cond}} \\cdot f_{\\mathrm{sw}} = (I^{2}R_{\\mathrm{DS(on)}})(1-D)T_{\\mathrm{sw}}f_{\\mathrm{sw}} = I^{2}R_{\\mathrm{DS(on)}}(1-D)$$\n\n2.  **Switching Loss ($P_{\\mathrm{sw}}$)**\n    The problem directs us to consider two components for switching loss, based on the provided fundamental definitions.\n    \n    a) **Gate-Drive Loss:** The energy required to charge the gate for turn-on is given as $E_{\\mathrm{gate}} = Q_{g}V_{\\mathrm{GS}}$. This energy is dissipated in the gate driver circuitry during each switching cycle. The corresponding average power loss is:\n    $$P_{\\mathrm{gate}} = E_{\\mathrm{gate}}f_{\\mathrm{sw}} = Q_{g}V_{\\mathrm{GS}}f_{\\mathrm{sw}}$$\n\n    b) **Output Capacitance Loss:** When the low-side MOSFET is off, the switch node is connected to $V_{\\mathrm{in}}$, so the voltage across the MOSFET's drain-source is $V_{\\mathrm{ds}} \\approx V_{\\mathrm{in}}$. The energy stored in its output capacitance $C_{oss}$ is $E_{oss} = \\frac{1}{2}C_{oss}V_{\\mathrm{ds}}^{2}$. When the MOSFET turns on, this stored energy is dissipated within the device's channel. The energy dissipated per cycle is:\n    $$E_{oss} = \\frac{1}{2} C_{oss}V_{\\mathrm{in}}^{2}$$\n    The corresponding average power loss is:\n    $$P_{oss} = E_{oss}f_{\\mathrm{sw}} = \\frac{1}{2} C_{oss}V_{\\mathrm{in}}^{2}f_{\\mathrm{sw}}$$\n\n    The total switching loss, $P_{\\mathrm{sw}}$, is the sum of these frequency-dependent losses:\n    $$P_{\\mathrm{sw}} = P_{\\mathrm{gate}} + P_{oss} = Q_{g}V_{\\mathrm{GS}}f_{\\mathrm{sw}} + \\frac{1}{2}C_{oss}V_{\\mathrm{in}}^{2}f_{\\mathrm{sw}} = \\left( Q_{g}V_{\\mathrm{GS}} + \\frac{1}{2}C_{oss}V_{\\mathrm{in}}^{2} \\right) f_{\\mathrm{sw}}$$\n\n3.  **Overall Score ($S$)**\n    The weighted selection criterion is given by:\n    $$S = w_{c} P_{\\mathrm{cond}} + w_{s} P_{\\mathrm{sw}} + w_{p}\\,\\mathrm{Price}$$\n    Substituting the derived power loss expressions, we get the full expression for the score of a single device:\n    $$S = w_{c} \\left( I^{2}R_{\\mathrm{DS(on)}}(1-D) \\right) + w_{s} \\left( Q_{g}V_{\\mathrm{GS}} + \\frac{1}{2}C_{oss}V_{\\mathrm{in}}^{2} \\right)f_{\\mathrm{sw}} + w_{p}\\,\\mathrm{Price}$$\n\n4.  **Indifference Current ($I^{\\star}$)**\n    The indifference current $I^{\\star}$ is the current at which the scores for Device A and Device B are equal, i.e., $S_{\\mathrm{A}} = S_{\\mathrm{B}}$.\n    $$w_{c} (I^{\\star})^{2}R_{\\mathrm{DS(on),A}}(1-D) + w_{s} P_{\\mathrm{sw,A}} + w_{p}\\,\\mathrm{Price}_{\\mathrm{A}} = w_{c} (I^{\\star})^{2}R_{\\mathrm{DS(on),B}}(1-D) + w_{s} P_{\\mathrm{sw,B}} + w_{p}\\,\\mathrm{Price}_{\\mathrm{B}}$$\n    where $P_{\\mathrm{sw,A}}$ and $P_{\\mathrm{sw,B}}$ are the respective switching losses for devices A and B.\n\n    We now rearrange the equation to solve for $(I^{\\star})^{2}$. We group the terms containing $(I^{\\star})^{2}$ on the left side and all other terms on the right side.\n    $$w_{c} (I^{\\star})^{2}(1-D) \\left( R_{\\mathrm{DS(on),A}} - R_{\\mathrm{DS(on),B}} \\right) = w_{s} \\left( P_{\\mathrm{sw,B}} - P_{\\mathrm{sw,A}} \\right) + w_{p} \\left( \\mathrm{Price}_{\\mathrm{B}} - \\mathrm{Price}_{\\mathrm{A}} \\right)$$\n    To avoid negative differences, it is algebraically cleaner to rearrange as:\n    $$w_{c} (I^{\\star})^{2}(1-D) \\left( R_{\\mathrm{DS(on),B}} - R_{\\mathrm{DS(on),A}} \\right) = w_{s} \\left( P_{\\mathrm{sw,A}} - P_{\\mathrm{sw,B}} \\right) + w_{p} \\left( \\mathrm{Price}_{\\mathrm{A}} - \\mathrm{Price}_{\\mathrm{B}} \\right)$$\n    Substituting the expression for switching power:\n    $$P_{\\mathrm{sw,A}} - P_{\\mathrm{sw,B}} = \\left( (Q_{g,A} - Q_{g,B})V_{\\mathrm{GS}} + \\frac{1}{2}(C_{oss,A}-C_{oss,B})V_{\\mathrm{in}}^{2} \\right) f_{\\mathrm{sw}}$$\n    Thus, the equation for $(I^{\\star})^{2}$ becomes:\n    $$(I^{\\star})^{2} = \\frac{w_{s}f_{\\mathrm{sw}} \\left[ (Q_{g,A} - Q_{g,B})V_{\\mathrm{GS}} + \\frac{1}{2}(C_{oss,A}-C_{oss,B})V_{\\mathrm{in}}^{2} \\right] + w_{p}(\\mathrm{Price}_{\\mathrm{A}} - \\mathrm{Price}_{\\mathrm{B}})}{w_{c}(1-D)(R_{\\mathrm{DS(on),B}} - R_{\\mathrm{DS(on),A}})}$$\n    Taking the square root gives the symbolic solution for $I^{\\star}$:\n    $$I^{\\star} = \\sqrt{\\frac{w_{s}f_{\\mathrm{sw}} \\left[ (Q_{g,A} - Q_{g,B})V_{\\mathrm{GS}} + \\frac{1}{2}(C_{oss,A}-C_{oss,B})V_{\\mathrm{in}}^{2} \\right] + w_{p}(\\mathrm{Price}_{\\mathrm{A}} - \\mathrm{Price}_{\\mathrm{B}})}{w_{c}(1-D)(R_{\\mathrm{DS(on),B}} - R_{\\mathrm{DS(on),A}})}}$$\n\n5.  **Numerical Calculation**\n    We substitute the given values in SI units:\n    - $w_c = 0.6$, $w_s = 0.4$, $w_p = 0.1\\ \\mathrm{W}/\\$$\n    - $f_{\\mathrm{sw}} = 500 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$\n    - $D = 0.1$, so $1-D=0.9$\n    - $V_{\\mathrm{GS}} = 5\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n    - $V_{\\mathrm{in}} = 12\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n    - $R_{\\mathrm{DS(on),A}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\Omega$, $R_{\\mathrm{DS(on),B}} = 3.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\Omega$\n    - $Q_{g,A} = 80 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{C}$, $Q_{g,B} = 45 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{C}$\n    - $C_{oss,A} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{F}$, $C_{oss,B} = 0.7 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{F}$\n    - $\\mathrm{Price}_{\\mathrm{A}} = 1.40\\ \\$$, $\\mathrm{Price}_{\\mathrm{B}} = 0.85\\ \\$$\n\n    Calculate the difference terms:\n    - $\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{DS(on)}} = R_{\\mathrm{DS(on),B}} - R_{\\mathrm{DS(on),A}} = (3.5 - 2.0) \\times 10^{-3} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\Omega$\n    - $\\Delta Q_g = Q_{g,A} - Q_{g,B} = (80 - 45) \\times 10^{-9} = 35 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{C}$\n    - $\\Delta C_{oss} = C_{oss,A} - C_{oss,B} = (1.2 - 0.7) \\times 10^{-9} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{F}$\n    - $\\Delta \\mathrm{Price} = \\mathrm{Price}_{\\mathrm{A}} - \\mathrm{Price}_{\\mathrm{B}} = 1.40 - 0.85 = 0.55\\ \\$$\n    \n    Now, calculate the numerator of the fraction under the square root:\n    - Term 1 (switching difference): $w_{s}f_{\\mathrm{sw}} [ \\Delta Q_g V_{\\mathrm{GS}} + \\frac{1}{2} \\Delta C_{oss}V_{\\mathrm{in}}^{2} ]$\n      - $\\Delta Q_g V_{\\mathrm{GS}} = (35 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{C})(5\\ \\mathrm{V}) = 175 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{J}$\n      - $\\frac{1}{2} \\Delta C_{oss}V_{\\mathrm{in}}^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} (0.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{F})(12\\ \\mathrm{V})^{2} = (0.25 \\times 10^{-9})(144)\\ \\mathrm{J} = 36 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{J}$\n      - Bracket term: $(175 + 36) \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{J} = 211 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{J}$\n      - Term 1 value: $(0.4)(500 \\times 10^{3})(211 \\times 10^{-9}) = (2 \\times 10^{5})(211 \\times 10^{-9}) = 0.0422\\ \\mathrm{W}$\n    - Term 2 (price difference): $w_{p} \\Delta \\mathrm{Price} = (0.1\\ \\mathrm{W}/\\$) (0.55\\ \\$) = 0.055\\ \\mathrm{W}$\n    - Numerator = $0.0422\\ \\mathrm{W} + 0.055\\ \\mathrm{W} = 0.0972\\ \\mathrm{W}$\n\n    Calculate the denominator:\n    - Denominator = $w_{c}(1-D)\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{DS(on)}} = (0.6)(0.9)(1.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\Omega) = 0.81 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\Omega$\n\n    Finally, calculate $(I^{\\star})^{2}$:\n    $$(I^{\\star})^{2} = \\frac{0.0972\\ \\mathrm{W}}{0.81 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\Omega} = 120\\ \\mathrm{A}^{2}$$\n    \n    Solve for $I^{\\star}$:\n    $$I^{\\star} = \\sqrt{120}\\ \\mathrm{A} \\approx 10.95445\\ \\mathrm{A}$$\n    Rounding to four significant figures gives $10.95\\ \\mathrm{A}$. This is the current at which the higher cost and higher switching loss of Device A are exactly offset by its lower conduction loss compared to Device B, according to the specified selection criterion.",
