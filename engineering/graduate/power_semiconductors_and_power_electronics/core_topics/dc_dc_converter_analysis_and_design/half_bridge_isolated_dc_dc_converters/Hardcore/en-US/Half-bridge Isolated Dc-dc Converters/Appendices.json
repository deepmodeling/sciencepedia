However, the inherent switching nature of these circuits means the output is never perfectly flat; it contains a small, high-frequency AC component known as ripple.

            "problem": "A voltage-fed half-bridge isolated direct current to direct current converter comprises a primary half-bridge that applies a bipolar square-wave voltage to an ideal transformer with primary-to-secondary turns ratio $N_p : N_s$, followed by an ideal full-wave rectifier and an $LC$ output filter feeding a resistive load $R_o$. Assume ideal switches, an ideal transformer, negligible leakage and magnetizing effects in the ripple calculation, and a continuous conduction mode of the output inductor current. The half-bridge produces a primary square wave of amplitude $V_{\\mathrm{in}}/2$; the secondary delivers a rectified pulse train whose fundamental repetition is twice the primary switching frequency.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and self-consistent. The provided parameters are physically realistic for a switched-mode power supply, and the topology described is standard in power electronics. The assumption of continuous conduction mode is explicitly stated and can be verified to be consistent with the given parameters post-calculation. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from fundamental principles as requested.\n\n**1. Ripple Frequency and Rectified Voltage**\nThe primary side of the half-bridge converter creates a bipolar square-wave voltage across the transformer primary. This waveform has a frequency equal to the switching frequency, $f_s = 100\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$. The full-wave rectifier on the secondary side inverts the negative portions of the secondary AC voltage. Consequently, the output of the rectifier is a unipolar pulse train with two pulses for every one cycle of the primary waveform. Therefore, the fundamental frequency of the ripple voltage and current seen by the output $LC$ filter is twice the switching frequency.\nThe ripple frequency, $f_{ripple}$, is:\n$$f_{ripple} = 2 f_s = 2 \\times (100 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{Hz}) = 200\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$$\nThe period of this ripple, which the problem denotes as $T_p$, is:\n$$T_p = \\frac{1}{f_{ripple}} = \\frac{1}{2 f_s} = \\frac{1}{200 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{Hz}} = 5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\n\nThe half-bridge produces a primary voltage amplitude of $V_{\\mathrm{in}}/2$. Given $V_{\\mathrm{in}} = 400\\,\\mathrm{V}$, the primary voltage amplitude is $V_{p,amp} = 400\\,\\mathrm{V} / 2 = 200\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\nThe transformer has a turns ratio $n = N_p/N_s = 8/1 = 8$. The secondary voltage amplitude is $V_{s,amp} = V_{p,amp} / n = 200\\,\\mathrm{V} / 8 = 25\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\nSince the rectifier is ideal, the amplitude of the rectified voltage pulses applied to the input of the $LC$ filter, $V_{rect}$, is equal to the secondary voltage amplitude:\n$$V_{rect} = 25\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n\n**2. DC Output Voltage and Current**\nThe $LC$ filter averages the pulsating input voltage $V_{rect}$. With a duty ratio $D = 0.40$, the DC component of the output voltage, $V_o$, is:\n$$V_o = D \\cdot V_{rect} = 0.40 \\times 25\\,\\mathrm{V} = 10\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nThe DC output current, $I_o$, flowing through the load resistance $R_o = 2.0\\,\\Omega$ is determined by Ohm's law:\n$$I_o = \\frac{V_o}{R_o} = \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{V}}{2.0\\,\\Omega} = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{A}$$\n\n**3. Peak-to-Peak Output Current Ripple ($\\Delta I_o$)**\nIn this context, the \"output current ripple\" refers to the peak-to-peak ripple in the inductor current, $\\Delta I_L$, as this is the current supplied by the converter's output stage. We are given the circuit operates in Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM).\nThe voltage across the inductor is given by $v_L(t) = L \\frac{di_L}{dt}$. We can find the change in inductor current, $\\Delta I_L$, by integrating the voltage across it over a portion of the switching period.\nWe assume the output voltage ripple is small, so $v_o(t) \\approx V_o$.\nDuring the interval when the switch is effectively 'on' (duration $DT_p$), the voltage across the inductor is $v_L = V_{rect} - V_o$.\nDuring the interval when the switch is effectively 'off' (duration $(1-D)T_p$), the voltage across the inductor is $v_L = 0 - V_o = -V_o$ (assuming an ideal freewheeling diode in the rectifier).\nFor steady-state operation, the net change in inductor current over one period $T_p$ must be zero. The peak-to-peak ripple $\\Delta I_L$ is the magnitude of the change during either the 'on' or 'off' interval. Using the 'off' interval is simpler:\n$$\\Delta I_L = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{DT_p}^{T_p} |v_L(t)| dt = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{DT_p}^{T_p} V_o dt = \\frac{V_o}{L} (T_p - DT_p) = \\frac{V_o(1-D)T_p}{L}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$L = 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{H} = 50 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{H}$$\n$$D = 0.40$$\n$$T_p = 5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\n$$\\Delta I_L = \\frac{(10\\,\\mathrm{V})(1 - 0.40)(5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s})}{50 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{H}} = \\frac{10 \\times 0.60 \\times 5}{50}\\,\\mathrm{A} = \\frac{30}{50}\\,\\mathrm{A} = 0.6\\,\\mathrm{A}$$\nThus, the peak-to-peak output current ripple is $\\Delta I_o = \\Delta I_L = 0.6\\,\\mathrm{A}$.\nWe check the CCM assumption: the average inductor current is $I_L = I_o = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{A}$. The minimum inductor current is $I_{L,min} = I_L - \\frac{\\Delta I_L}{2}$ (for symmetric ripple, more generally $I_{L,min} > 0$). Here, $I_{L,min}$ will be well above zero since $5.0\\,\\mathrm{A} \\gg 0.6\\,\\mathrm{A}/2$, so the CCM assumption is valid.\n\n**4. Peak-to-Peak Output Voltage Ripple ($\\Delta V_o$)**\nThe output voltage ripple, $\\Delta V_o$, is caused by the inductor's ripple current, $\\Delta I_L$, flowing through the output capacitor and its Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR). We make the standard approximation that the impedance of the capacitor branch is much smaller than the load resistance $R_o$ at the ripple frequency, so nearly all the ripple current flows through the capacitor.\nThe total voltage ripple is the sum of the ripple across the ESR ($R_{esr}$) and the ripple across the ideal capacitance ($C$).\n$$\\Delta V_o = \\Delta V_{esr} + \\Delta V_{C}$$\nThe voltage drop across the ESR is in phase with the current flowing through it. Its peak-to-peak value is:\n$$\\Delta V_{esr} = \\Delta I_L \\cdot R_{esr}$$ With $R_{esr} = 30\\,\\mathrm{m}\\Omega = 0.030\\,\\Omega$:\n$$\\Delta V_{esr} = (0.6\\,\\mathrm{A})(0.030\\,\\Omega) = 0.018\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nThe voltage ripple across the capacitance itself, $\\Delta V_C$, is due to the charging and discharging by the ripple current. The change in voltage is $\\Delta V_C = \\Delta Q / C$, where $\\Delta Q$ is the charge accumulated.\nThe capacitor current, $i_C(t)$, is the inductor current minus its DC component, $i_C(t) = i_L(t) - I_o$. The charge $\\Delta Q$ that leads to the peak-to-peak voltage ripple is the area under the $i_C(t)$ curve over the time it is positive. For a triangular ripple current, a widely used and accurate approximation for this charge is:\n$$\\Delta Q = \\frac{1}{8} \\Delta I_L T_p$$\nThis approximation assumes a symmetric triangular ripple current but is reasonably accurate even for the asymmetric case ($D \\neq 0.5$).\nSo, the capacitive voltage ripple component is:\n$$\\Delta V_C = \\frac{\\Delta I_L T_p}{8 C}$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$C = 470\\,\\mu\\mathrm{F} = 470 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{F}$$\n$$\\Delta V_C = \\frac{(0.6\\,\\mathrm{A})(5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s})}{8 \\times (470 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{F})} = \\frac{3 \\times 10^{-6}}{3760 \\times 10^{-6}}\\,\\mathrm{V} \\approx 0.00079787\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nThe total peak-to-peak voltage ripple, $\\Delta V_o$, is approximated by the linear sum of the ESR and capacitive components. This is a common and conservative engineering estimate, as the two components are not perfectly in phase.\n$$\\Delta V_o \\approx \\Delta V_{esr} + \\Delta V_C = 0.018\\,\\mathrm{V} + 0.00079787\\,\\mathrm{V} = 0.01879787\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n\n**5. Final Numerical Results**\nThe problem requests answers rounded to four significant figures.\nPeak-to-peak output current ripple:\n$$\\Delta I_o = 0.6000\\,\\mathrm{A}$$\nPeak-to-peak output voltage ripple:\n$$\\Delta V_o = 0.01880\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nThe results are presented as a row matrix $(\\Delta I_o, \\Delta V_o)$.",

The commutation of the leg node is governed by the capacitor charge relation $q = C v$ and the current-charge relation $i = \\mathrm{d}q/\\mathrm{d}t$, together with the capacitor energy relation $E = \\frac{1}{2} C v^2$.\n\nTwo competing loss mechanisms arise from dead time choice:\n\n- If $t_d$ is shorter than the time required to fully move the leg voltage from one rail to the other, the MOSFET channel must turn on while a residual voltage remains across $C_{\\mathrm{eq}}$, and the energy $\\frac{1}{2} C_{\\mathrm{eq}} v_{\\mathrm{res}}^2$ is dissipated per transition in overlap conduction.\n- If $t_d$ is longer than that required commutation time, the incoming device’s body diode conducts for the excess interval, incurring conduction loss $V_D |I_m| \\Delta t$ and reverse-recovery energy when the MOSFET channel turns on.\n\nUse the following scientifically consistent parameters:\n- Input voltage $V_{\\mathrm{in}} = 380$ $\\mathrm{V}$.\n- Effective leg capacitance $C_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 600 \\times 10^{-12}$ $\\mathrm{F}$.\n- Magnetizing current magnitude at commutation $|I_m| = 1.5$ $\\mathrm{A}$.\n- Fixed dead time $t_d = 90 \\times 10^{-9}$ $\\mathrm{s}$.\n- Body diode forward drop $V_D = 0.9$ $\\mathrm{V}$.\n- Reverse-recovery charge at $|I_m|$ (only applicable if the diode conducts) $Q_{\\mathrm{rr}} = 35 \\times 10^{-9}$ $\\mathrm{C}$.\n- Switching frequency $f_s = 250 \\times 10^{3}$ $\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n- Output power $P_{\\mathrm{out}} = 800$ $\\mathrm{W}$.\n\nStarting from the fundamental relations stated above, derive the leg commutation time required for zero-voltage switching (ZVS) in terms of $C_{\\mathrm{eq}}$, $V_{\\mathrm{in}}$, and $I_m$, then identify which regime applies for the specified $t_d$. For the applicable regime, compute the dead-time-induced switching loss per transition, the average power loss due to dead-time commutation over time, and finally the converter efficiency defined as $\\eta = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{out}}}{P_{\\mathrm{out}} + P_{\\mathrm{dead}}}$, where $P_{\\mathrm{dead}}$ is the average dead-time-induced loss power. Ignore all other loss mechanisms (conduction, core, copper, and control losses). Express the final efficiency as a decimal number, and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All parameters required for a unique solution are provided, and the physical model, while simplified, is consistent and standard for a first-order analysis in power electronics.\n\nThe task is to determine the efficiency of a half-bridge converter, accounting only for losses incurred during the dead-time commutation. This requires a multi-step analysis beginning with the derivation of the characteristic commutation time.\n\nFirst, we derive the time required to achieve zero-voltage switching (ZVS), denoted as $t_{\\mathrm{ZVS}}$. The problem states that during the dead time, the constant magnetizing current $I_m$ charges or discharges the effective leg capacitance $C_{\\mathrm{eq}}$. The relationship between current, charge, and voltage is given by the fundamental relations $i(t) = \\mathrm{d}q(t)/\\mathrm{d}t$ and $q(t) = C v(t)$. Combining these for the leg capacitance yields:\n$$i(t) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t} (C_{\\mathrm{eq}} v_{\\mathrm{leg}}(t))$$\nSince $C_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ is a constant, we have:\n$$i(t) = C_{\\mathrm{eq}} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{\\mathrm{leg}}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}$$\nThe current driving the commutation is the magnetizing current, which is assumed constant with magnitude $|I_m|$. Therefore, the rate of voltage change across the leg is constant:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{\\mathrm{leg}}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{|I_m|}{C_{\\mathrm{eq}}}$$\nFor a full commutation to achieve ZVS, the leg voltage must slew between the DC rails, from $0$ to $V_{\\mathrm{in}}$ or vice-versa. The total voltage swing required is $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{leg}}$:\n$$\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{leg}} = V_{\\mathrm{in}}$$\nThe time required to complete this full voltage swing, $t_{\\mathrm{ZVS}}$, is found by integrating the rate of voltage change over this interval:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{ZVS}} = \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{leg}}}{|I_m| / C_{\\mathrm{eq}}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{eq}} V_{\\mathrm{in}}}{|I_m|}$$\nThis is the minimum dead time required to ensure ZVS.\n\nNext, we substitute the given parameter values to calculate $t_{\\mathrm{ZVS}}$:\n- Input voltage $V_{\\mathrm{in}} = 380$ $\\mathrm{V}$\n- Effective leg capacitance $C_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 600 \\times 10^{-12}$ $\\mathrm{F}$\n- Magnetizing current magnitude $|I_m| = 1.5$ $\\mathrm{A}$\n\n$$t_{\\mathrm{ZVS}} = \\frac{(600 \\times 10^{-12}) \\times 380}{1.5} = \\frac{2.28 \\times 10^{-7}}{1.5} = 1.52 \\times 10^{-7} \\ \\mathrm{s} = 152 \\ \\mathrm{ns}$$\nThe specified fixed dead time is $t_d = 90 \\times 10^{-9}$ $\\mathrm{s} = 90$ $\\mathrm{ns}$. We must now compare $t_d$ with $t_{\\mathrm{ZVS}}$.\nSince $t_d = 90 \\ \\mathrm{ns} < t_{\\mathrm{ZVS}} = 152 \\ \\mathrm{ns}$, the dead time is insufficient for the leg voltage to fully commutate. This condition is known as hard switching, as the incoming MOSFET must turn on while a non-zero voltage remains across it.\n\nWe now calculate the energy loss per transition for this hard-switching regime. The voltage slew that occurs during the dead time $t_d$ is:\n$$\\Delta v_{\\mathrm{slew}} = \\frac{|I_m| t_d}{C_{\\mathrm{eq}}} = \\frac{1.5 \\times (90 \\times 10^{-9})}{600 \\times 10^{-12}} = \\frac{1.35 \\times 10^{-7}}{6 \\times 10^{-10}} = 225 \\ \\mathrm{V}$$\nThe total required swing is $V_{\\mathrm{in}} = 380$ $\\mathrm{V}$. The residual voltage across the leg that has not been commutated is the difference between the full required swing and the swing accomplished during the dead time. This voltage, $v_{\\mathrm{res}}$, will appear across the turning-on MOSFET.\n$$v_{\\mathrm{res}} = V_{\\mathrm{in}} - \\Delta v_{\\mathrm{slew}} = 380 \\ \\mathrm{V} - 225 \\ \\mathrm{V} = 155 \\ \\mathrm{V}$$\nAccording to the problem statement, the energy dissipated per transition due to this hard turn-on event is $E_{\\mathrm{sw}} = \\frac{1}{2} C_{\\mathrm{eq}} v_{\\mathrm{res}}^2$.\n$$E_{\\mathrm{sw}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (600 \\times 10^{-12}) \\times (155)^2 = (300 \\times 10^{-12}) \\times 24025 = 7.2075 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{J}$$\n\nThis loss occurs at each commutation, and there are two commutations per switching cycle (one for leg rising, one for leg falling). The average power loss, $P_{\\mathrm{dead}}$, is therefore:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{dead}} = 2 \\times E_{\\mathrm{sw}} \\times f_s$$\nUsing the given switching frequency $f_s = 250 \\times 10^{3}$ $\\mathrm{Hz}$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{dead}} = 2 \\times (7.2075 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times (250 \\times 10^{3}) = 3.60375 \\ \\mathrm{W}$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the converter efficiency, $\\eta$. The problem specifies to ignore all other losses, so the input power $P_{\\mathrm{in}}$ is the sum of the output power $P_{\\mathrm{out}}$ and the dead-time loss $P_{\\mathrm{dead}}$.\n$$P_{\\mathrm{in}} = P_{\\mathrm{out}} + P_{\\mathrm{dead}}$$\nGiven $P_{\\mathrm{out}} = 800$ $\\mathrm{W}$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{in}} = 800 \\ \\mathrm{W} + 3.60375 \\ \\mathrm{W} = 803.60375 \\ \\mathrm{W}$$\nThe efficiency is defined as $\\eta = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{out}}}{P_{\\mathrm{in}}}$.\n$$\\eta = \\frac{800}{803.60375} \\approx 0.9955150$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\eta \\approx 0.9955$$",
