            "problem": "Consider a synchronous half-bridge using a high-side gate driver that is supplied by a bootstrap capacitor referenced to the switching node. The driver includes an undervoltage lockout (UVLO) mechanism with hysteresis on the bootstrap supply voltage. Specifically, the UVLO enables the high-side output only when the bootstrap voltage $V_{\\text{BS}}$ rises above $V_{\\text{BS,UVLO,rise}}=8\\,\\text{V}$ and disables it when $V_{\\text{BS}}$ falls below $V_{\\text{BS,UVLO,fall}}=7\\,\\text{V}$. The nominal regulated bootstrap voltage is $V_{\\text{BS,nom}}=12\\,\\text{V}$, and the converter switches at $f_s=300\\,\\text{kHz}$.\n\nThe bootstrap capacitor is periodically charged and then partially discharged during each switching cycle, resulting in a ripple on $V_{\\text{BS}}$.

The concepts of a bootstrap supply, undervoltage lockout (UVLO) with hysteresis, and voltage ripple are fundamental to the operation of high-side gate drivers. The provided numerical values for voltages and frequency are physically realistic and consistent with component datasheets for such devices. The problem is well-posed, as it requests the calculation of a limiting value based on a clear operational constraint (no UVLO tripping). The language is objective and precise. The statement that the voltage is refreshed \"near $V_{\\text{BS,nom}}$\" is a standard idealization, reasonably interpreted as the peak voltage of the ripple waveform being equal to $V_{\\text{BS,nom}}$. The problem is self-contained and does not violate any scientific principles or contain logical contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum allowable peak-to-peak ripple on the bootstrap supply voltage, $\\Delta V_{\\text{BS,pp}}$, that ensures the high-side gate driver does not shut down during operation. The driver's state is controlled by an undervoltage lockout (UVLO) circuit with hysteresis.\n\nLet $V_{\\text{BS}}(t)$ be the instantaneous bootstrap voltage. The UVLO mechanism works as follows:\n-   To become enabled, $V_{\\text{BS}}(t)$ must rise above the turn-on threshold, $V_{\\text{BS,UVLO,rise}} = 8\\,\\text{V}$.\n-   Once enabled, the driver will shut down (become disabled) if $V_{\\text{BS}}(t)$ falls below the turn-off threshold, $V_{\\text{BS,UVLO,fall}} = 7\\,\\text{V}$.\n\nThe problem describes the behavior of $V_{\\text{BS}}(t)$ over a switching cycle. It is charged to a peak value and then droops as it supplies charge to the high-side MOSFET gate and internal driver circuitry. We are given that the capacitor is refreshed to a level near the nominal regulated voltage, $V_{\\text{BS,nom}} = 12\\,\\text{V}$. We make the standard assumption that the peak voltage of the ripple waveform, $V_{\\text{BS,peak}}$, is equal to this nominal voltage.\n$$V_{\\text{BS,peak}} = V_{\\text{BS,nom}} = 12\\,\\text{V}$$\n\nThe peak-to-peak ripple voltage, $\\Delta V_{\\text{BS,pp}}$, is the difference between the peak voltage and the minimum voltage, $V_{\\text{BS,min}}$, during a cycle.\n$$\\Delta V_{\\text{BS,pp}} = V_{\\text{BS,peak}} - V_{\\text{BS,min}}$$\n\nTo ensure continuous, uninterrupted operation (i.e., to prevent \"chatter\" or shutdown), the bootstrap voltage must never fall below the UVLO falling threshold. This imposes a strict condition on the minimum voltage of the waveform:\n$$V_{\\text{BS,min}} > V_{\\text{BS,UVLO,fall}}$$\n\nTo find the largest *allowable* ripple, we consider the limiting case where the minimum voltage approaches the falling threshold from above.\n$$V_{\\text{BS,min,limit}} = V_{\\text{BS,UVLO,fall}} = 7\\,\\text{V}$$\nAny ripple larger than the one corresponding to this limit would cause $V_{\\text{BS,min}}$ to drop below $7\\,\\text{V}$, triggering the UVLO.\n\nThe largest allowable peak-to-peak ripple, which we denote as $\\Delta V_{\\text{BS,pp,max}}$, is therefore the difference between the peak voltage and this minimum allowed voltage.\n$$\\Delta V_{\\text{BS,pp,max}} = V_{\\text{BS,peak}} - V_{\\text{BS,min,limit}}$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$\\Delta V_{\\text{BS,pp,max}} = V_{\\text{BS,nom}} - V_{\\text{BS,UVLO,fall}}$$\n$$\\Delta V_{\\text{BS,pp,max}} = 12\\,\\text{V} - 7\\,\\text{V} = 5\\,\\text{V}$$\n\nNow, we consider the role of the UVLO rising threshold, $V_{\\text{BS,UVLO,rise}} = 8\\,\\text{V}$. This threshold is relevant for turning the driver *on*, either at initial startup or after a UVLO fault has occurred. During normal steady-state operation, the bootstrap voltage peaks at $V_{\\text{BS,peak}} = 12\\,\\text{V}$ in each cycle. Since $12\\,\\text{V} > 8\\,\\text{V}$, the condition to remain enabled is met at the start of each high-side conduction interval. The operational constraint is not on turning on, but on not turning off. Therefore, the ripple magnitude is constrained by how far the voltage can droop from its peak before hitting the *falling* threshold, $V_{\\text{BS,UVLO,fall}}$. The rising threshold, $V_{\\text{BS,UVLO,rise}}$, provides a hysteresis window of $V_{\\text{BS,UVLO,rise}} - V_{\\text{BS,UVLO,fall}} = 8\\,\\text{V} - 7\\,\\text{V} = 1\\,\\text{V}$, which prevents oscillations if the voltage hovers exactly at the threshold due to noise. However, it does not determine the maximum allowable ripple in this scenario, as the peak voltage is well above both thresholds.\n\nThe switching frequency, $f_s = 300\\,\\text{kHz}$, is provided but is not necessary for calculating the maximum allowable voltage ripple. This parameter would be essential if one were asked to calculate the required bootstrap capacitance $C_{\\text{BS}}$ to keep the ripple below this determined maximum value, as the ripple is a function of load current, on-time (related to $f_s$), and capacitance. Since the question asks only for the voltage limit, $f_s$ is extraneous information.\n\nThe largest allowable peak-to-peak ripple is $5\\,\\text{V}$.",

At $t=0$, this voltage is $10.2\\,\\text{V}$, which is above the rising UVLO threshold of $V_{\\text{UVLO,rise}} = 9.5\\,\\text{V}$, so the driver is active and ready. As the driver sources charge to the MOSFET gate, this charge is drawn from $C_{\\text{B}}$. According to the law of charge conservation and the definition of capacitance ($Q = C V$), the removal of charge $\\Delta Q$ from $C_{\\text{B}}$ causes its voltage to drop by $\\Delta V_{\\text{BS}} = \\Delta Q / C_{\\text{B}}$.\n2.  **Correlate Events in Time**: The provided measurements allow for a direct temporal correlation between the bootstrap supply voltage and the gate voltage behavior.\n    - **From $t=0$ to $t \\approx 60\\,\\text{ns}$**: The driver successfully charges the gate, causing $V_{\\text{GS}}$ to rise to $9.2\\,\\text{V}$. In this period, $V_{\\text{BS}}$ droops from $10.2\\,\\text{V}$ to $9.1\\,\\text{V}$. This is normal operation.\n    - **At $t \\approx 95\\,\\text{ns}$**: The measured data explicitly states that $V_{\\text{BS}}$ crosses $8.5\\,\\text{V}$.\n    - **The UVLO Threshold**: The problem specifies the driver's undervoltage lockout falling threshold is $V_{\\text{UVLO,fall}} = 8.5\\,\\text{V}$.\n    - **UVLO Protection Mechanism**: When a gate driver's supply voltage falls below its UVLO threshold, a built-in protection circuit is triggered. This circuit's function is to prevent damage to the MOSFET that could result from insufficient gate drive (e.g., operating in the linear region with high conduction losses). The standard protective action is to disable the driver's output and actively pull the gate to its source reference potential, forcing the MOSFET off.\n3.  **Synthesize the Explanation**: At $t \\approx 95\\,\\text{ns}$, the bootstrap supply voltage $V_{\\text{BS}}$ sags to the UVLO falling threshold $V_{\\text{UVLO,fall}}$. This triggers the driver's UVLO protection. The driver immediately stops trying to turn the MOSFET on and instead enables its internal pull-down transistor, which begins to discharge the gate capacitance. This action directly causes the observed collapse of $V_{\\text{GS}}$ towards $0\\,\\text{V}$, which is observed to be complete by $t \\approx 120\\,\\text{ns}$. The event at $t \\approx 95\\,\\text{ns}$ falls exactly within the observed timeframe of the $V_{\\text{GS}}$ collapse.\n\nThis chain of events provides a complete and self-consistent physical explanation for the observed failure, based directly on the provided data and fundamental operating principles of bootstrap gate drivers.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. High-side undervoltage lockout (UVLO) due to bootstrap-supply sag below $V_{\\text{UVLO,fall}}$ during the gate-charge transient.**\n- **Justification**: As derived above, the timeline of events perfectly matches this explanation. The measured bootstrap voltage $V_{\\text{BS}}$ is explicitly shown to cross the specified UVLO falling threshold $V_{\\text{UVLO,fall}} = 8.5\\,\\text{V}$ at $t \\approx 95\\,\\text{ns}$. This event provides a direct and sufficient cause for the gate driver to shut down and pull $V_{\\text{GS}}$ low, which is exactly what was measured. The sag itself is a predictable consequence of charging the gate from the bootstrap capacitor.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Miller injection through $C_{\\text{GD}}$ due to the switch-node slew $\\frac{dV_{\\text{SW}}}{dt}$ pulling $V_{\\text{GS}}$ down at the moment of attempted turn-on.**\n- **Justification**: This option proposes that a current induced by a fast-changing switch-node voltage is responsible for pulling the gate down. The current through the gate-drain capacitance is given by $i_{\\text{GD}} = C_{\\text{GD}} \\frac{dV_{\\text{DG}}}{dt}$. For the high-side MOSFET, the voltage across this capacitor is $V_{\\text{DG}} = V_{\\text{D}} - V_{\\text{G}} = V_{\\text{DC}} - (V_{\\text{HS}} + V_{\\text{GS}})$. A change in the switch-node voltage $V_{\\text{HS}}$ (or $V_{\\text{SW}}$) induces a current. However, the problem explicitly states that the switch-node voltage $V_{\\text{SW}}$ remains at $0\\,\\text{V}$ from $t=0$ until $t \\approx 140\\,\\text{ns}$. The collapse of $V_{\\text{GS}}$ occurs between $t \\approx 60\\,\\text{ns}$ and $t \\approx 120\\,\\text{ns}$. During this entire interval, $\\frac{dV_{\\text{SW}}}{dt} = 0$. Therefore, there is no Miller injection current caused by switch-node slewing at the time of the event. The high slew rate event occurs *after* the gate has already collapsed.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Simultaneous UVLO and Miller injection together are required to explain the collapse of $V_{\\text{GS}}$.**\n- **Justification**: This option claims that both phenomena are necessary. As established in the analysis of option B, Miller injection due to switch-node slew is not occurring at the time of the gate voltage collapse. Since one of the supposedly required conditions is absent, this option is false. The UVLO event alone is sufficient to explain the observation.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Neither UVLO nor Miller injection; the collapse is due to propagation-delay jitter alone in the level-shift path of the driver.**\n- **Justification**: Propagation delay jitter is the random, small variation in the turn-on and turn-off delay of a driver. It might cause the rising edge of $V_{\\text{GS}}$ to be shifted by a few nanoseconds from one cycle to the next. It does not provide a physical mechanism for the driver to begin charging the gate, reach a voltage of $9.2\\,\\text{V}$, and then abruptly reverse course and discharge the gate. The observed behavior is a functional shutdown, not a timing artifact. The direct measurement of the supply voltage hitting the UVLO threshold provides a much more compelling and physically grounded explanation.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.",
