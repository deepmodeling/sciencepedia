The low-side reference (common) is ground. The gate driver has a ground-referenced supply $V_{\\text{DD}}$ that charges $C_{\\text{boot}}$ through a diode when $V_{\\text{S}}$ is near ground.

The phenomenon of negative voltage transients at the switching node due to parasitic inductance and reverse recovery of the low-side body diode is a well-documented and real effect in power electronics. The principles involved (Kirchhoff's laws, component voltage stress) are fundamental to circuit analysis. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posedness:** The problem provides all necessary numerical values ($V_{\\text{DD}}$, transient voltage) and a clear set of assumptions (ideal diode clamping, timing of worst-case event, safety margin) to calculate a unique, deterministic answer. The objective is unambiguous.\n-   **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, technical language, free from subjective or biased terms.\n-   **Consistency and Completeness:** The assumptions provided are self-consistent and sufficient for solving the problem. The simplification to ignore the diode drop is explicitly stated for conservatism, which is a common practice in worst-case analysis.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and internally consistent. A solution will be derived based on the provided information and fundamental circuit principles.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to find the minimum required voltage rating for the bootstrap capacitor, $C_{\\text{boot}}$. This rating is determined by the maximum instantaneous voltage the capacitor will experience in operation, plus a specified safety margin.\n\nThe voltage across the bootstrap capacitor, $V_{C_{\\text{boot}}}$, is defined as the potential difference between its terminals, which are connected to the high-side floating supply node $V_{\\text{B}}$ and the switching node $V_{\\text{S}}$.\n$$V_{C_{\\text{boot}}} = V_{\\text{B}} - V_{\\text{S}}$$\n\nThe problem directs us to analyze the worst-case stress on $C_{\\text{boot}}$. This occurs when the magnitude of $V_{C_{\\text{boot}}}$ is maximized. According to the expression above, this will happen when $V_{\\text{B}}$ is at its maximum possible value while $V_{\\text{S}}$ is at its minimum possible value.\n\nThe problem specifies the conditions for this worst-case scenario:\n1.  The switching node $V_{\\text{S}}$ experiences a negative transient, reaching a minimum potential of $V_{\\text{S,min}} = -3\\,\\text{V}$ with respect to ground.\n2.  Simultaneously, the bootstrap diode is assumed to be conducting, connecting the ground-referenced driver supply $V_{\\text{DD}}$ to the floating supply node $V_{\\text{B}}$. The problem states to ignore the forward voltage drop of the diode for a conservative analysis. This idealization means the diode acts as a perfect short circuit when forward biased. Therefore, the potential at node $V_{\\text{B}}$ is clamped to the potential of the driver supply.\n    $$V_{\\text{B,max}} = V_{\\text{DD}} = 12\\,\\text{V}$$\n\nWe can formalize this using Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) for the loop consisting of the $V_{\\text{DD}}$ supply, the bootstrap diode, the bootstrap capacitor $C_{\\text{boot}}$, and the switch node potential $V_{\\text{S}}$ relative to ground. Starting from ground and traversing the loop:\n$$+V_{\\text{DD}} - V_{\\text{diode}} - V_{C_{\\text{boot}}} - V_{\\text{S}} = 0$$\nUnder the provided assumption that the diode forward drop is zero ($V_{\\text{diode}} = 0$), the equation simplifies to:\n$$V_{\\text{DD}} - V_{C_{\\text{boot}}} - V_{\\text{S}} = 0$$\nSolving for the capacitor voltage:\n$$V_{C_{\\text{boot}}} = V_{\\text{DD}} - V_{\\text{S}}$$\n\nTo find the maximum capacitor voltage, $V_{C_{\\text{boot,max}}}$, we use the minimum value of $V_{\\text{S}}$:\n$$V_{C_{\\text{boot,max}}} = V_{\\text{DD}} - V_{\\text{S,min}}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$V_{\\text{DD}} = 12\\,\\text{V}$$\n$$V_{\\text{S,min}} = -3\\,\\text{V}$$\n$$V_{C_{\\text{boot,max}}} = 12\\,\\text{V} - (-3\\,\\text{V}) = 12\\,\\text{V} + 3\\,\\text{V} = 15\\,\\text{V}$$\nThis is the peak instantaneous voltage stress experienced by the capacitor.\n\nFinally, the problem requires that the capacitor's voltage rating include a safety margin of 50%. A 50% margin means the rating must be at least $1 + 0.50 = 1.5$ times the maximum expected operating voltage. Let $V_{\\text{rating}}$ be the minimum required voltage rating.\n$$V_{\\text{rating}} = V_{C_{\\text{boot,max}}} \\times (1 + \\frac{50}{100})$$\n$$V_{\\text{rating}} = 15\\,\\text{V} \\times (1 + 0.5)$$\n$$V_{\\text{rating}} = 15\\,\\text{V} \\times 1.5$$\n$$V_{\\text{rating}} = 22.5\\,\\text{V}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value of $22.5$ already has three significant figures.\nThus, the minimum required voltage rating for $C_{\\text{boot}}$ is $22.5\\,\\text{V}$.",

At $t=0$, this voltage is $10.2\\,\\text{V}$, which is above the rising UVLO threshold of $V_{\\text{UVLO,rise}} = 9.5\\,\\text{V}$, so the driver is active and ready. As the driver sources charge to the MOSFET gate, this charge is drawn from $C_{\\text{B}}$. According to the law of charge conservation and the definition of capacitance ($Q = C V$), the removal of charge $\\Delta Q$ from $C_{\\text{B}}$ causes its voltage to drop by $\\Delta V_{\\text{BS}} = \\Delta Q / C_{\\text{B}}$.\n2.  **Correlate Events in Time**: The provided measurements allow for a direct temporal correlation between the bootstrap supply voltage and the gate voltage behavior.\n    - **From $t=0$ to $t \\approx 60\\,\\text{ns}$**: The driver successfully charges the gate, causing $V_{\\text{GS}}$ to rise to $9.2\\,\\text{V}$. In this period, $V_{\\text{BS}}$ droops from $10.2\\,\\text{V}$ to $9.1\\,\\text{V}$. This is normal operation.\n    - **At $t \\approx 95\\,\\text{ns}$**: The measured data explicitly states that $V_{\\text{BS}}$ crosses $8.5\\,\\text{V}$.\n    - **The UVLO Threshold**: The problem specifies the driver's undervoltage lockout falling threshold is $V_{\\text{UVLO,fall}} = 8.5\\,\\text{V}$.\n    - **UVLO Protection Mechanism**: When a gate driver's supply voltage falls below its UVLO threshold, a built-in protection circuit is triggered. This circuit's function is to prevent damage to the MOSFET that could result from insufficient gate drive (e.g., operating in the linear region with high conduction losses). The standard protective action is to disable the driver's output and actively pull the gate to its source reference potential, forcing the MOSFET off.\n3.  **Synthesize the Explanation**: At $t \\approx 95\\,\\text{ns}$, the bootstrap supply voltage $V_{\\text{BS}}$ sags to the UVLO falling threshold $V_{\\text{UVLO,fall}}$. This triggers the driver's UVLO protection. The driver immediately stops trying to turn the MOSFET on and instead enables its internal pull-down transistor, which begins to discharge the gate capacitance. This action directly causes the observed collapse of $V_{\\text{GS}}$ towards $0\\,\\text{V}$, which is observed to be complete by $t \\approx 120\\,\\text{ns}$. The event at $t \\approx 95\\,\\text{ns}$ falls exactly within the observed timeframe of the $V_{\\text{GS}}$ collapse.\n\nThis chain of events provides a complete and self-consistent physical explanation for the observed failure, based directly on the provided data and fundamental operating principles of bootstrap gate drivers.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. High-side undervoltage lockout (UVLO) due to bootstrap-supply sag below $V_{\\text{UVLO,fall}}$ during the gate-charge transient.**\n- **Justification**: As derived above, the timeline of events perfectly matches this explanation. The measured bootstrap voltage $V_{\\text{BS}}$ is explicitly shown to cross the specified UVLO falling threshold $V_{\\text{UVLO,fall}} = 8.5\\,\\text{V}$ at $t \\approx 95\\,\\text{ns}$. This event provides a direct and sufficient cause for the gate driver to shut down and pull $V_{\\text{GS}}$ low, which is exactly what was measured. The sag itself is a predictable consequence of charging the gate from the bootstrap capacitor.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Miller injection through $C_{\\text{GD}}$ due to the switch-node slew $\\frac{dV_{\\text{SW}}}{dt}$ pulling $V_{\\text{GS}}$ down at the moment of attempted turn-on.**\n- **Justification**: This option proposes that a current induced by a fast-changing switch-node voltage is responsible for pulling the gate down. The current through the gate-drain capacitance is given by $i_{\\text{GD}} = C_{\\text{GD}} \\frac{dV_{\\text{DG}}}{dt}$. For the high-side MOSFET, the voltage across this capacitor is $V_{\\text{DG}} = V_{\\text{D}} - V_{\\text{G}} = V_{\\text{DC}} - (V_{\\text{HS}} + V_{\\text{GS}})$. A change in the switch-node voltage $V_{\\text{HS}}$ (or $V_{\\text{SW}}$) induces a current. However, the problem explicitly states that the switch-node voltage $V_{\\text{SW}}$ remains at $0\\,\\text{V}$ from $t=0$ until $t \\approx 140\\,\\text{ns}$. The collapse of $V_{\\text{GS}}$ occurs between $t \\approx 60\\,\\text{ns}$ and $t \\approx 120\\,\\text{ns}$. During this entire interval, $\\frac{dV_{\\text{SW}}}{dt} = 0$. Therefore, there is no Miller injection current caused by switch-node slewing at the time of the event. The high slew rate event occurs *after* the gate has already collapsed.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Simultaneous UVLO and Miller injection together are required to explain the collapse of $V_{\\text{GS}}$.**\n- **Justification**: This option claims that both phenomena are necessary. As established in the analysis of option B, Miller injection due to switch-node slew is not occurring at the time of the gate voltage collapse. Since one of the supposedly required conditions is absent, this option is false. The UVLO event alone is sufficient to explain the observation.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Neither UVLO nor Miller injection; the collapse is due to propagation-delay jitter alone in the level-shift path of the driver.**\n- **Justification**: Propagation delay jitter is the random, small variation in the turn-on and turn-off delay of a driver. It might cause the rising edge of $V_{\\text{GS}}$ to be shifted by a few nanoseconds from one cycle to the next. It does not provide a physical mechanism for the driver to begin charging the gate, reach a voltage of $9.2\\,\\text{V}$, and then abruptly reverse course and discharge the gate. The observed behavior is a functional shutdown, not a timing artifact. The direct measurement of the supply voltage hitting the UVLO threshold provides a much more compelling and physically grounded explanation.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.",
