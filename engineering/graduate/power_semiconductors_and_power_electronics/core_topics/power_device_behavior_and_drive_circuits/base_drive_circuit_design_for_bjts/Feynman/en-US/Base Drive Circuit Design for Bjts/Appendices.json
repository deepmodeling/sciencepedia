It is scientifically sound, well-posed, complete, and describes a realistic engineering task. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution\nThe objective is to determine the base current, $I_{B}$, required to drive a power BJT with a collector current of $I_{C} = 50\\,\\text{A}$. The design specifies a forced current gain, $\\beta_{\\text{forced}}$, which is defined as the ratio of the collector current to the base current that the drive circuit will enforce:\n$$I_{B} = \\frac{I_{C}}{\\beta_{\\text{forced}}}$$\nFor the BJT to operate correctly as a switch in the 'on' state, it must be driven into saturation. Saturation is guaranteed if and only if the forced gain is less than the transistor's actual current gain, $\\beta$. To ensure saturation under all circumstances, the design must be based on the worst-case (minimum) current gain, $\\beta_{\\min}$, that the device will exhibit under the specified operating conditions and manufacturing tolerances. The condition for guaranteed saturation is:\n$$\\beta_{\\text{forced}} \\le \\beta_{\\min}(I_{C}, T_{j})$$\nThe problem explicitly requires verification of this condition before calculating $I_{B}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the nominal current gain, $\\beta_{\\text{nom}}$, at the specified collector current $I_{C} = 50\\,\\text{A}$ and junction temperature $T_{j} = 398\\,\\text{K}$.\nWe are given the model:\n$$\\beta_{\\text{nom}}(I_{C},T_{j})=\\beta_{0}\\left(\\frac{I_{C}}{I_{\\text{ref}}}\\right)^{-m}\\left[1-\\eta\\left(T_{j}-T_{\\text{ref}}\\right)\\right]$$\nSubstituting the given parameter values:\n- $\\beta_{0}=80$\n- $I_{C}=50\\,\\text{A}$\n- $I_{\\text{ref}}=10\\,\\text{A}$\n- $m=0.15$\n- $\\eta=2.0\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$\n- $T_{j}=398\\,\\text{K}$\n- $T_{\\text{ref}}=298\\,\\text{K}$\n\nThe current ratio is:\n$$\\frac{I_{C}}{I_{\\text{ref}}} = \\frac{50\\,\\text{A}}{10\\,\\text{A}} = 5$$\nThe temperature difference is:\n$$T_{j}-T_{\\text{ref}} = 398\\,\\text{K} - 298\\,\\text{K} = 100\\,\\text{K}$$\nNow, we can substitute these intermediate values into the equation for $\\beta_{\\text{nom}}$:\n$$\\beta_{\\text{nom}} = 80 \\times (5)^{-0.15} \\times \\left[1 - (2.0\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{K}^{-1})(100\\,\\text{K})\\right]$$\n$$\\beta_{\\text{nom}} = 80 \\times (5)^{-0.15} \\times \\left[1 - 0.2\\right]$$\n$$\\beta_{\\text{nom}} = 80 \\times (5)^{-0.15} \\times 0.8$$\nLet's evaluate the term $(5)^{-0.15}$:\n$$(5)^{-0.15} \\approx 0.785523$$\nThus, the nominal gain is:\n$$\\beta_{\\text{nom}} \\approx 80 \\times 0.785523 \\times 0.8 \\approx 50.2735$$\n\nNext, we calculate the worst-case minimum gain, $\\beta_{\\min}$, which accounts for manufacturing variations, using the factor $\\Delta = 0.25$:\n$$\\beta_{\\min}(I_{C},T_{j})=(1-\\Delta)\\,\\beta_{\\text{nom}}(I_{C},T_{j})$$\n$$\\beta_{\\min} = (1 - 0.25) \\times \\beta_{\\text{nom}} = 0.75 \\times \\beta_{\\text{nom}}$$\n$$\\beta_{\\min} \\approx 0.75 \\times 50.2735 \\approx 37.7051$$\n\nNow, we verify the saturation condition. The specified forced gain is $\\beta_{\\text{forced}}=10$.\nWe must check if $\\beta_{\\text{forced}} \\le \\beta_{\\min}$:\n$$10 \\le 37.7051$$\nThis inequality is true. Therefore, a forced gain of $10$ is achievable and will drive the transistor into deep saturation even under worst-case conditions, as intended by the design.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the required base current $I_{B}$ using the specified forced gain $\\beta_{\\text{forced}}$:\n$$I_{B} = \\frac{I_{C}}{\\beta_{\\text{forced}}} = \\frac{50\\,\\text{A}}{10} = 5\\,\\text{A}$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

We may proceed to the solution.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\nThe total stored charge, $Q_s$, in a saturated BJT is the excess charge that must be removed from the base and collector regions to turn the device off. The reverse base current, $i_B(t)$, is the physical mechanism for this charge removal (carrier sweep-out). By definition, the total charge extracted is the time integral of the magnitude of the reverse base current from the start of the turn-off process ($t=0$) until the current decays to zero.\n\n$$ Q_s = \\int_0^\\infty |i_B(t)| \\, dt $$\n\nUsing the given piecewise expression for $i_B(t)$, we can calculate $Q_s$. The magnitude of the current is:\n$$\n|i_B(t)| = \n\\begin{cases}\nI_0 & \\text{for } 0 \\le t < t_1,\\\\\nI_0\\,e^{-\\frac{t - t_1}{\\tau}} & \\text{for } t \\ge t_1,\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe integral is separated into two parts corresponding to the piecewise definition:\n$$ Q_s = \\int_0^{t_1} I_0 \\, dt + \\int_{t_1}^\\infty I_0\\,e^{-\\frac{t - t_1}{\\tau}} \\, dt $$\n\nWe evaluate each integral:\nThe first integral is the charge removed during the constant-current phase (storage time):\n$$ \\int_0^{t_1} I_0 \\, dt = I_0 [t]_0^{t_1} = I_0 t_1 $$\nThe second integral is the charge removed during the exponential decay phase (fall time):\n$$ \\int_{t_1}^\\infty I_0\\,e^{-\\frac{t - t_1}{\\tau}} \\, dt = I_0 \\int_{t_1}^\\infty e^{-\\frac{t - t_1}{\\tau}} \\, dt $$\nLet $u = t - t_1$, so $du = dt$. The limits of integration become $u=0$ to $u=\\infty$.\n$$ I_0 \\int_0^\\infty e^{-\\frac{u}{\\tau}} \\, du = I_0 \\left[ -\\tau e^{-\\frac{u}{\\tau}} \\right]_0^\\infty = I_0 \\left( 0 - (-\\tau e^0) \\right) = I_0 \\tau $$\nThe total stored charge is the sum of these two components:\n$$ Q_s = I_0 t_1 + I_0 \\tau = I_0 (t_1 + \\tau) $$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$I_0 = 5\\,\\text{A}$, $t_1 = 0.6\\,\\mu\\text{s}$, and $\\tau = 0.4\\,\\mu\\text{s}$.\n$$ Q_s = (5\\,\\text{A}) \\times (0.6 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{s} + 0.4 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{s}) = (5\\,\\text{A}) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{s}) = 5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{C} = 5\\,\\mu\\text{C} $$\nThe measured stored charge is $5\\,\\mu\\text{C}$.\n\nFor the design requirement, we need to remove this total charge $Q_s$ within a time $t_{\\text{clear}} = 0.8\\,\\mu\\text{s}$. Assuming an ideal constant reverse base current $I_{B,\\text{rev}}$ is used, the charge removed is $Q_{\\text{extracted}} = I_{B,\\text{rev}} \\times t_{\\text{clear}}$. To guarantee turn-off, we must have $Q_{\\text{extracted}} \\ge Q_s$. Therefore, the minimum required reverse current is:\n$$ I_{B,\\text{rev}} \\ge \\frac{Q_s}{t_{\\text{clear}}} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ I_{B,\\text{rev}} \\ge \\frac{5\\,\\mu\\text{C}}{0.8\\,\\mu\\text{s}} = \\frac{5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{C}}{0.8 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{s}} = \\frac{5}{0.8}\\,\\text{A} = 6.25\\,\\text{A} $$\nThus, a reverse base current of at least $6.25\\,\\text{A}$ is required to clear the stored charge within $0.8\\,\\mu\\text{s}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.** Drive the BJT into saturation, then abruptly reverse-bias the base-emitter junction with a stiff source; measure $i_B(t)$ during the recovery and compute $Q_s$ as the time integral of the measured reverse base current until it decays to negligible. For the given waveform, $Q_s = 5\\,\\mu\\text{C}$, and to guarantee removal within $t_{\\text{clear}} = 0.8\\,\\mu\\text{s}$ by a constant reverse current, one needs $I_{B,\\text{rev}} \\ge \\frac{Q_s}{t_{\\text{clear}}} = 6.25\\,\\text{A}$, subject to base-emitter reverse-voltage and driver dissipation constraints.\n\n- The description of the measurement procedure is correct.\n- The calculation of $Q_s = 5\\,\\mu\\text{C}$ is correct, as derived above.\n- The calculation of the required reverse current $I_{B,\\text{rev}} \\ge 6.25\\,\\text{A}$ is also correct.\n- The mention of practical constraints is appropriate and shows a complete understanding.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B.** Estimate $Q_s$ from the base-emitter junction capacitance as $Q_s \\approx C_{BE}\\,\\Delta V_{BE}$ using $C_{BE} = 200\\,\\text{pF}$ and $\\Delta V_{BE} = 5\\,\\text{V}$, which gives $Q_s = 1\\,\\text{nC}$, and thus choose $I_{B,\\text{rev}} \\approx \\frac{Q_s}{t_{\\text{clear}}} = 1.25\\,\\text{mA}$.\n\n- This option fundamentally misunderstands the origin of stored charge in a saturated BJT. The stored charge is minority carrier diffusion charge, not depletion layer charge associated with a small-signal capacitance. The problem explicitly states to neglect displacement currents from such capacitances. The calculated charge of $1\\,\\text{nC}$ is three orders of magnitude smaller than the actual charge of $5\\,\\mu\\text{C}$.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C.** Use the same reverse-bias procedure but compute $Q_s$ only from the exponential tail of $i_B(t)$, giving $Q_s = I_0\\,\\tau = 2\\,\\mu\\text{C}$, and set $I_{B,\\text{rev}} \\approx \\frac{Q_s}{t_{\\text{clear}}} = 2.5\\,\\text{A}$.\n\n- This method for computing $Q_s$ is flawed. It calculates only the charge removed after the storage time, $Q_{\\text{tail}} = I_0 \\tau = (5\\,\\text{A})(0.4\\,\\mu\\text{s}) = 2\\,\\mu\\text{C}$. It incorrectly ignores the charge removed during the constant-current phase, $Q_{\\text{storage}} = I_0 t_1 = (5\\,\\text{A})(0.6\\,\\mu\\text{s}) = 3\\,\\mu\\text{C}$. The total charge is the sum, $5\\,\\mu\\text{C}$. By underestimating the charge, it leads to an insufficient reverse drive recommendation.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D.** Infer $Q_s$ from the collector-current fall as $Q_s \\approx I_C\\,t_{\\text{clear}} = 16\\,\\mu\\text{C}$ and dimension the reverse base drive to match the collector current, choosing $I_{B,\\text{rev}} \\approx I_C = 20\\,\\text{A}$ so that the base drive mirrors the collector current during turn-off.\n\n- This option suggests an ad-hoc and physically baseless method for estimating $Q_s$. The stored charge is a property of the device and its operating point ($I_C, I_B$ in saturation), not a product of the on-state current and a target clearing time. The subsequent suggestion to set the reverse base current equal to the collector current is a rule of thumb at best, not a\nprincipled design approach derived from the physics of charge control. The estimation of $Q_s$ is incorrect.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
