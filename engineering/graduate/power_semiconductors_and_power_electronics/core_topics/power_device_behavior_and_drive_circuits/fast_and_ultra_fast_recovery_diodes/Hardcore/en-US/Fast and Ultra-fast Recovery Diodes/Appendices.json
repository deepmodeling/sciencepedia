This first practice uses a simplified 'hard-recovery' model, a common starting point for analysis, to calculate the peak reverse current ($I_{RM}$) and peak instantaneous power dissipation. Mastering this calculation helps build intuition for how stored charge ($Q_{rr}$) and commutation speed ($di/dt$) directly translate into peak electrical stress on the device.",

During diode turn-off, the external circuit imposes a constant current slew rate $d i / d t$ while a clamp holds the diode at an approximately constant reverse voltage $V_{R}$. The device datasheet characterizes the reverse recovery charge $Q_{\\mathrm{rr}}$ under the same current slew. Assume the hard-recovery limit in which the reverse current rises linearly from zero to the peak reverse recovery current $I_{RM}$ with slope $d i / d t$, and then drops to zero abruptly.

Reverse recovery charge $Q_{rr}$ is defined as the time integral of the magnitude of the reverse current during the recovery event. If the reverse current is represented as a signed quantity $i_{RR}(t)$ that is negative during the recovery pulse, then $Q_{rr}$ can be written as\n$$\nQ_{rr} = \\int_{t_s}^{t_e} \\left|i_{RR}(t)\\right|\\,dt = \\int_{t_s}^{t_e} \\max\\left(0, -i_{RR}(t)\\right)\\,dt,\n$$\nwhere $[t_s,t_e]$ is the recovery interval. In the provided data, the sampling times $t_n$ are known and the measurements are $i_n = i_{RR}(t_n) + \\epsilon_n$ with zero-mean noise $\\epsilon_n$.\n\nTo compute the integral from discrete samples, we adopt a composite numerical integration method grounded in Riemann sums. A principled estimator for integrals on discrete data is the composite trapezoidal rule. For nonuniform sampling times $t_0  t_1  \\dots  t_N$ and corresponding magnitudes $j_n = \\max(0, -i_n)$, the trapezoidal estimator is\n$$\n\\hat{Q}_{rr} = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\frac{j_k + j_{k+1}}{2}\\,\\Delta t_k, \\quad \\Delta t_k = t_{k+1} - t_k.\n$$\nThis is derived directly from approximating $j(t)$ as piecewise linear between samples, which preserves the integral’s consistency with the definition $i(t)=\\frac{dQ}{dt}$ and avoids shortcut formulas. The estimator $\\hat{Q}_{rr}$ is a linear functional of the samples $\\{j_n\\}$, which enables principled uncertainty propagation.\n\nUncertainty from discretization (sampling) arises because the integral of a continuous function is approximated using discrete samples. For sufficiently smooth waveforms, the error of the trapezoidal rule on a uniform grid scales as $\\mathcal{O}(h^2)$, where $h$ is the grid spacing. A first-principles approach to estimate the discretization uncertainty without knowing higher derivatives is to compare integral estimates computed on two nested grids: a fine grid and a coarser grid created by decimating every other sample, both using the same trapezoidal estimator. Denote by $\\hat{Q}_h$ the estimate using the fine grid and by $\\hat{Q}_{2h}$ the estimate using the decimated grid. Richardson extrapolation for the trapezoidal rule on uniform grids motivates the use of the difference to quantify discretization bias. A conservative one-standard-deviation-equivalent discretization uncertainty can be taken as\n$$\nu_{\\text{samp}} \\approx \\frac{\\left|\\hat{Q}_h - \\hat{Q}_{2h}\\right|}{3},\n$$\nnoting that for nonuniform grids this provides an empirical bound that respects the same principle: the coarser grid suppresses high-frequency content and reveals sensitivity of the integral to the sampling density.\n\nMeasurement noise uncertainty is derived by modeling $i_n = i_{RR}(t_n) + \\epsilon_n$ with independent, zero-mean noise $\\epsilon_n$ of variance $\\sigma^2$.

A robust, first-principles approach is to estimate the underlying smooth magnitude $j(t)$ via a moving-average smoother and then estimate the noise level from the residuals. Define $j_n = \\max(0, -i_n)$ and let $\\tilde{j}_n$ be a locally averaged version of $j_n$ computed with a window small compared to the waveform’s timescale. The residuals $r_n = j_n - \\tilde{j}_n$ capture the high-frequency fluctuations attributable to noise. A robust estimate of $\\sigma$ is then\n$$\n\\hat{\\sigma} = 1.4826 \\cdot \\operatorname{median}\\left(\\left|r_n\\right|\\right),\n$$\nwhich uses the median absolute deviation scaling for Gaussian noise and is grounded in statistical principles. If $\\hat{\\sigma} = 0$ due to very low noise or extremely smooth data, one may fallback to the sample standard deviation of $r_n$.\n\nAssuming the discretization error and the measurement noise are independent uncertainty sources, the combined one-standard-deviation uncertainty can be reported via quadrature:\n$$\nu = \\sqrt{u_{\\text{noise}}^2 + u_{\\text{samp}}^2}.\n$$\nThis combination is consistent with the propagation of independent uncertainties in linear estimators and avoids shortcut formulas.\n\nAlgorithmic steps implemented in the program:\n1. For each test case, generate the sampling times $\\{t_n\\}$ and the measured current samples $\\{i_n\\}$ with the prescribed random seed. For the exponential decay cases, use $i_{RR}(t) = -I_0 \\exp(-t/\\tau)$. For the triangular case, construct the piecewise linear magnitude $j_{\\text{true}}(t)$ and set $i_{RR}(t) = -j_{\\text{true}}(t)$.

Estimate $\\hat{\\sigma}$ from residuals of a moving-average smoothing of $j_n$, and compute the weights $w_n$ for the trapezoidal estimator on a nonuniform grid. Compute $u_{\\text{noise}} = \\sqrt{\\hat{\\sigma}^2 \\sum w_n^2}$.\n6. Combine uncertainties by $u = \\sqrt{u_{\\text{noise}}^2 + u_{\\text{samp}}^2}$.\n7.
