Let the reverse-recovery current attain its maximum magnitude $I_{RM}>0$ at time $t=t_{p}$, with $0<t_{p}<t_{rr}$.

            "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. The givens are:\n- The reverse-recovery charge $Q_{rr}=\\int_{0}^{t_{rr}} \\left|I_{R}(t)\\right|\\,dt$.\n- The reverse-recovery current is modeled as $I_{R}(t)=-\\,I_{RM}\\,g\\!\\left(\\tfrac{t}{t_{rr}};\\mu\\right)$ for $0\\le t\\le t_{rr}$.\n- The parameters $I_{RM}$ and $t_{rr}$ represent the peak reverse current magnitude and total recovery time, respectively.\n- $g(\\tau;\\mu)$ is a normalized shape function with $0 \\le g \\le 1$ and $g(\\tau_p;\\mu) = 1$ at the time of peak current, $\\tau_p=t_p/t_{rr}$.\n- For the specific case, a triangular model is used where $t_{rr}=t_s+t_f$ and the softness factor is $\\sigma=t_f/t_s$. The time intervals $t_s$ and $t_f$ correspond to the rising and falling edges of the current magnitude.\n\nThe problem is valid as it deals with standard, formalizable concepts in power electronics and provides sufficient information for a unique solution.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in two parts as requested.\n\nFirst, we derive the general expression for the reverse-recovery charge $Q_{rr}$. We begin with the definition:\n$$\nQ_{rr} = \\int_{0}^{t_{rr}} |I_{R}(t)| \\, dt\n$$\nThe problem states that the reverse current is given by $I_{R}(t) = -I_{RM} g(t/t_{rr}; \\mu)$. The magnitude of the current is therefore:\n$$\n|I_{R}(t)| = |-I_{RM} g(t/t_{rr}; \\mu)|\n$$\nGiven that $I_{RM} > 0$ and the normalized function $g$ satisfies $0 \\le g(\\tau;\\mu) \\le 1$, the magnitude simplifies to:\n$$\n|I_{R}(t)| = I_{RM} g(t/t_{rr}; \\mu)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the integral for $Q_{rr}$:\n$$\nQ_{rr} = \\int_{0}^{t_{rr}} I_{RM} g(t/t_{rr}; \\mu) \\, dt\n$$\nSince $I_{RM}$ is the peak value and thus a constant with respect to the integration variable $t$, it can be factored out of the integral:\n$$\nQ_{rr} = I_{RM} \\int_{0}^{t_{rr}} g(t/t_{rr}; \\mu) \\, dt\n$$\nTo simplify the integral, we perform a change of variables using the normalized time $\\tau = t/t_{rr}$. This implies $t = \\tau t_{rr}$ and the differential $dt = t_{rr} d\\tau$. The limits of integration for $\\tau$ are from $\\tau(0) = 0/t_{rr} = 0$ to $\\tau(t_{rr}) = t_{rr}/t_{rr} = 1$. The expression for $Q_{rr}$ becomes:\n$$\nQ_{rr} = I_{RM} \\int_{0}^{1} g(\\tau; \\mu) \\, (t_{rr} d\\tau)\n$$\nFactoring out the constant $t_{rr}$, we arrive at the general expression for $Q_{rr}$:\n$$\nQ_{rr} = I_{RM} t_{rr} \\int_{0}^{1} g(\\tau; \\mu) \\, d\\tau\n$$\nThis equation relates $Q_{rr}$ to $I_{RM}$, $t_{rr}$, and the definite integral of the normalized current-shape function $g(\\tau;\\mu)$, which depends on the shape parameter $\\mu$. This completes the first part of the derivation.\n\nSecond, we specialize this result to the piecewise-linear triangular reverse current approximation. The magnitude of the current, $|I_R(t)|$, increases linearly from $0$ to $I_{RM}$ over the storage interval $t_s = t_p$, and then decreases linearly from $I_{RM}$ to $0$ over the fall interval $t_f = t_{rr} - t_s$.\n\nThe total charge $Q_{rr}$ is the area under the $|I_R(t)|$ versus $t$ curve. For a triangular waveform, this area is simply the area of a triangle with base $t_{rr}$ and height $I_{RM}$. The formula for the area of a triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$.\n$$\nQ_{rr} = \\frac{1}{2} t_{rr} I_{RM}\n$$\nNotably, this result is independent of the individual values of $t_s$ and $t_f$, and thus independent of the softness factor $\\sigma = t_f/t_s$.\n\nTo formally demonstrate this by specializing the general result, we must first find the function $g(\\tau)$ for the triangular case and evaluate its integral. The dimensionless time of the peak is $\\tau_p = t_p/t_{rr} = t_s/t_{rr}$. The normalized shape function $g(\\tau) = |I_R(t)|/I_{RM}$ is:\n$$\ng(\\tau) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_p} & \\text{for } 0 \\le \\tau \\le \\tau_p \\\\ \\frac{1-\\tau}{1-\\tau_p} & \\text{for } \\tau_p < \\tau \\le 1 \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe softness factor $\\sigma = t_f/t_s$ relates to $\\tau_p$ as $\\tau_p = t_s/(t_s+t_f) = 1/(1+t_f/t_s) = 1/(1+\\sigma)$. Thus, the shape parameter $\\mu$ for this family is $\\tau_p$ (or equivalently, $\\sigma$).\n\nNow, we evaluate the integral of $g(\\tau)$ from $0$ to $1$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{1} g(\\tau) \\, d\\tau = \\int_{0}^{\\tau_p} \\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_p} \\, d\\tau + \\int_{\\tau_p}^{1} \\frac{1-\\tau}{1-\\tau_p} \\, d\\tau\n$$\nEvaluating the first integral:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\tau_p} \\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_p} \\, d\\tau = \\frac{1}{\\tau_p} \\left[ \\frac{\\tau^2}{2} \\right]_{0}^{\\tau_p} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_p} \\frac{\\tau_p^2}{2} = \\frac{\\tau_p}{2}\n$$\nEvaluating the second integral:\n$$\n\\int_{\\tau_p}^{1} \\frac{1-\\tau}{1-\\tau_p} \\, d\\tau = \\frac{1}{1-\\tau_p} \\left[ \\tau - \\frac{\\tau^2}{2} \\right]_{\\tau_p}^{1} = \\frac{1}{1-\\tau_p} \\left( \\left(1-\\frac{1^2}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\tau_p - \\frac{\\tau_p^2}{2}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{1}{1-\\tau_p} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\tau_p + \\frac{\\tau_p^2}{2} \\right) = \\frac{1-2\\tau_p+\\tau_p^2}{2(1-\\tau_p)} = \\frac{(1-\\tau_p)^2}{2(1-\\tau_p)} = \\frac{1-\\tau_p}{2}\n$$\nThe sum of the two integrals is:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{1} g(\\tau) \\, d\\tau = \\frac{\\tau_p}{2} + \\frac{1-\\tau_p}{2} = \\frac{\\tau_p + 1 - \\tau_p}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that for any triangular shape (i.e., for any value of $\\tau_p$ between $0$ and $1$, or any softness factor $\\sigma>0$), the area under the normalized current curve is exactly $1/2$.\n\nSubstituting this value back into the general expression for $Q_{rr}$:\n$$\nQ_{rr} = I_{RM} t_{rr} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} I_{RM} t_{rr}\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the reverse-recovery charge for the triangular current model, expressed solely in terms of the peak reverse current $I_{RM}$ and the total reverse-recovery time $t_{rr}$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the reverse recovery charge, $Q_{rr}$, which is associated with the extraction of stored minority carriers from the diode's drift region during reverse bias commutation. The total measured reverse charge, $Q_{\\text{meas}}$, is the time integral of the measured terminal current, $i_{\\text{meas}}(t)$. This total charge is composed of two components: the reverse recovery charge $Q_{rr}$ and the charge supplied to the voltage-dependent junction capacitance, $Q_c$. The relationship between these quantities is:\n$$Q_{\\text{meas}} = Q_{rr} + Q_c$$\nTo find $Q_{rr}$, we must first calculate $Q_{\\text{meas}}$ and $Q_c$ and then find their difference:\n$$Q_{rr} = Q_{\\text{meas}} - Q_c$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the total measured reverse charge, $Q_{\\text{meas}}$.

This charge corresponds to the change in stored electrostatic charge in the depletion region as the reverse voltage across the junction changes. The displacement current is $i_c(t) = dQ_j/dt$, where $Q_j$ is the charge stored on the junction capacitance. The total capacitive charge is the time integral of this current, which is equivalent to the total change in stored charge, $\\Delta Q_j = Q_j(V_f) - Q_j(V_i)$, where $V_i$ and $V_f$ are the initial and final junction voltages, respectively.\nBy definition, the junction capacitance is $C_j(V) = dQ_j/dV$. Therefore, the change in stored charge can be found by integrating the capacitance with respect to voltage:\n$$Q_c = \\int_{V_i}^{V_f} C_j(V)\\,dV$$\nThe applied reverse voltage is given by $v(t)=V_{R}(1-\\exp(-t/\\tau_{v}))$.
