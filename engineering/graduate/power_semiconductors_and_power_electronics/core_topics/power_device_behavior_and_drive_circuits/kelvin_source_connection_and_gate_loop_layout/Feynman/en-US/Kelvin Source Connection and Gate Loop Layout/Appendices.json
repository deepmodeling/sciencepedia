            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the effective gate-to-source voltage, $v_{GS,eff}$, for a MOSFET under two different gate drive return configurations: conventional and Kelvin source. Subsequently, the improvement in this voltage afforded by the Kelvin connection must be computed for the given parameters. The analysis will be based on fundamental circuit laws, namely Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) and the constitutive relation for an inductor.\n\nLet us define the relevant potentials and quantities:\n- $V_{\\text{drv}}$ is the command voltage supplied by the gate driver.\n- $v_{GS,eff}$ is the effective gate-to-source voltage at the semiconductor die.\n- $L_{\\text{CSI}}$ is the common source inductance, given as $5\\,\\text{nH}$.\n- $\\frac{di_{D}}{dt}$ is the rate of change of the drain current, given as $400\\,\\text{A}/\\mu\\text{s}$.\n- $v_{G}$ is the potential at the MOSFET gate terminal.\n- $v_{S}$ is the potential at the MOSFET source terminal (at the die/pad).\n- $v_{GND}$ is the potential of the power circuit ground, which we set to $0\\,\\text{V}$ as the reference potential.\n\nThe voltage induced across the common source inductance is given by the formula $v_{L} = L \\frac{di}{dt}$. During the turn-on transient, the current flowing through $L_{\\text{CSI}}$ is the source current, $i_S$, which is approximately equal to the drain current, $i_D$. Thus, the voltage drop across the common source inductance is:\n$$v_{L_{\\text{CSI}}} = L_{\\text{CSI}} \\frac{di_S}{dt} \\approx L_{\\text{CSI}} \\frac{di_D}{dt}$$\n\nThis induced voltage raises the potential of the source terminal, $v_S$, relative to the power ground, $v_{GND}$.\n$$v_S = v_{GND} + v_{L_{\\text{CSI}}} = 0 + L_{\\text{CSI}} \\frac{di_D}{dt} = L_{\\text{CSI}} \\frac{di_D}{dt}$$\n\nThe effective gate-to-source voltage at the die is defined as $v_{GS,eff} = v_G - v_S$. We now analyze the two connection schemes.\n\n**1. Conventional Source Connection**\n\nIn the conventional connection, the gate driver's return path is connected to the power ground, $v_{GND}$. The driver applies the voltage $V_{\\text{drv}}$ between the gate terminal and this ground. Assuming negligible impedance in the gate lead, the potential at the gate, $v_G$, is equal to the driver voltage relative to ground.\n$$v_G = V_{\\text{drv}}$$\nThe effective gate-to-source voltage is then:\n$$v_{GS,eff,conv} = v_G - v_S = V_{\\text{drv}} - L_{\\text{CSI}} \\frac{di_D}{dt}$$\nThis expression shows that the induced voltage across the common source inductance directly subtracts from the applied driver voltage, creating a negative feedback effect that can slow down switching or even prevent full turn-on under high $\\frac{di}{dt}$ conditions.\n\n**2. Kelvin Source Connection**\n\nIn the Kelvin source connection, the gate driver has a dedicated return sense line connected directly to the source bond pad of the MOSFET. The driver applies its command voltage, $V_{\\text{drv}}$, between the gate terminal and this source sense point. Therefore, the driver actively maintains the potential difference between the gate and source terminals.\n$$v_G - v_S = V_{\\text{drv}}$$\nBy definition, this potential difference is the effective gate-to-source voltage.\n$$v_{GS,eff,Kelvin} = v_G - v_S = V_{\\text{drv}}$$\nIn this configuration, the voltage drop across the common source inductance, $v_{L_{\\text{CSI}}}$, is outside of the gate drive loop. The driver compensates for the rise in source potential by raising the gate potential accordingly, ensuring that the voltage *across* the gate-source terminals of the die remains at the commanded value, $V_{\\text{drv}}$.\n\n**3. Improvement in Effective Gate-to-Source Voltage**\n\nThe improvement is defined as the difference between the effective gate-to-source voltage in the Kelvin configuration and that in the conventional configuration.\n$$\\Delta v_{GS,eff} = v_{GS,eff,Kelvin} - v_{GS,eff,conv}$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions:\n$$\\Delta v_{GS,eff} = (V_{\\text{drv}}) - \\left(V_{\\text{drv}} - L_{\\text{CSI}} \\frac{di_D}{dt}\\right)$$\n$$\\Delta v_{GS,eff} = V_{\\text{drv}} - V_{\\text{drv}} + L_{\\text{CSI}} \\frac{di_D}{dt}$$\n$$\\Delta v_{GS,eff} = L_{\\text{CSI}} \\frac{di_D}{dt}$$\nThe improvement is precisely the magnitude of the inductive voltage drop that is circumvented by the Kelvin connection.\n\n**4. Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- $L_{\\text{CSI}} = 5\\,\\text{nH} = 5 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{H}$\n- $\\frac{di_{D}}{dt} = 400\\,\\text{A}/\\mu\\text{s}$\n\nFirst, we convert the current slew rate to SI units:\n$$\\frac{di_{D}}{dt} = \\frac{400\\,\\text{A}}{1\\,\\mu\\text{s}} = \\frac{400\\,\\text{A}}{10^{-6}\\,\\text{s}} = 4 \\times 10^8\\,\\text{A/s}$$\nNow, we compute the improvement $\\Delta v_{GS,eff}$:\n$$\\Delta v_{GS,eff} = (5 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{H}) \\times (4 \\times 10^8\\,\\text{A/s})$$\n$$\\Delta v_{GS,eff} = 20 \\times 10^{-1}\\,\\text{V}$$\n$$\\Delta v_{GS,eff} = 2.0\\,\\text{V}$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.
