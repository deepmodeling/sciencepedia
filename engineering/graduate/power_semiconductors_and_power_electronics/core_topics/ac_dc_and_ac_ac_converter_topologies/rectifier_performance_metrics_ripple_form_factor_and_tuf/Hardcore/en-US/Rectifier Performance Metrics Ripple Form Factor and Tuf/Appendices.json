Let the filter's transfer function be $H(j\\omega)$. The ripple voltage at the output is $V_{\\mathrm{ac,rms,out}} \\approx |H(j\\omega_{\\mathrm{ripple}})| V_{\\mathrm{ac,rms,in}}$. The DC output voltage is reduced by the voltage drop across the total filter resistance $R_\\Sigma = NR$, where $R$ is the per-section resistance. $V_{\\mathrm{dc,out}} = V_{\\mathrm{dc},0} \\frac{R_L}{R_\\Sigma + R_L}$.\nThe ripple factor at the load is $r_{\\mathrm{out}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{ac,rms,out}}}{V_{\\mathrm{dc,out}}} \\approx \\frac{|H(j\\omega_{\\mathrm{ripple}})| V_{\\mathrm{ac,rms,in}}}{V_{\\mathrm{dc},0} \\frac{R_L}{R_\\Sigma+R_L}} = |H(j\\omega_{\\mathrm{ripple}})| \\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{ac,rms,in}}}{V_{\\mathrm{dc},0}}\\right) \\frac{R_\\Sigma+R_L}{R_L} = |H(j\\omega_{\\mathrm{ripple}})| r_0 \\frac{R_\\Sigma+R_L}{R_L}$.\nWe require $r_{\\mathrm{out}} \\le r_{\\mathrm{req}}$, which gives the attenuation requirement:\n$$|H(j\\omega_{\\mathrm{ripple}})| \\le \\frac{r_{\\mathrm{req}}}{r_0} \\frac{R_L}{R_\\Sigma + R_L}$$\n\n**Part 3: Filter Model and Attenuation Dependence**\nThe DC drop constraint is that the drop across $R_\\Sigma$, which is $I_{\\mathrm{dc,out}}R_\\Sigma$, must not exceed $5\\%$ of $V_{\\mathrm{dc},0}$.\n$$I_{\\mathrm{dc,out}}R_\\Sigma = \\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc},0}}{R_\\Sigma+R_L}\\right)R_\\Sigma \\le 0.05 V_{\\mathrm{dc},0}$$\n$$\\frac{R_\\Sigma}{R_\\Sigma+R_L} \\le 0.05 \\implies R_\\Sigma \\le 0.05R_\\Sigma + 0.05R_L \\implies 0.95R_\\Sigma \\le 0.05R_L \\implies R_\\Sigma \\le \\frac{0.05}{0.95}R_L = \\frac{1}{19}R_L$$\nNow we derive an approximate expression for the filter's transfer function magnitude, $|H(j\\omega)|$. An $N$-section RC filter is a cascade of $N$ identical stages. At frequencies well above the filter's corner frequencies, the impedance of the capacitors is small. The transfer function of a cascade of $N$ identical, well-decoupled low-pass RC sections is approximately the product of individual transfer functions. At high frequencies, $|H_1(j\\omega)| \\approx 1/(\\omega RC)$. This leads to the approximation:\n$$|H(j\\omega)| \\approx \\left(\\frac{1}{\\omega RC}\\right)^N = \\left(\\frac{N}{\\omega R_\\Sigma C}\\right)^N$$\nThis approximation is physically justified when each capacitor's impedance is much smaller than its series resistor's impedance, i.e., $\\omega RC \\gg 1$. More accurately, for the approximation to be valid for a cascade, a stricter condition such as $\\omega RC \\gg 2$ is needed to neglect interaction terms. The constraint $\\omega R_L C \\gg 1$ ensures the load $R_L$ is effectively shunted by the final capacitor, making the last section behave similarly to the preceding ones.\n\n**Part 4: Minimal Filter Order $N$ and Component Verification**\nWe seek the smallest integer $N \\ge 1$ for which there exist component values $R$ and $C$ satisfying all constraints. The constraints for a given $N$ are:\n1.  DC Drop: $R_\\Sigma = NR \\le \\frac{1}{19}R_L$.\n2.  Attenuation: $|H_N(j\\omega_{\\mathrm{ripple}})| \\le \\frac{r_{\\mathrm{req}}}{r_0} \\frac{R_L}{R_\\Sigma + R_L}$. We use the exact transfer function for the specific $N$ to perform the design calculation.\n3.  Self-Consistency: The chosen $(R, C)$ must be consistent with the approximation used in Part 3. We take this to mean the validity condition $\\omega RC \\gg 2$ must hold. Let's use a factor of $5$, i.e., $\\omega RC \\ge 10$.\n\nLet's test $N=1$:\nThe exact transfer function for a single RC section with load $R_L$ in parallel with $C$ is $H_1(j\\omega) = \\frac{R_L || (1/j\\omega C)}{R + (R_L || 1/j\\omega C)} = \\frac{R_L}{R+R_L+j\\omega CRR_L}$.\nThe magnitude is $|H_1(j\\omega)| = \\frac{R_L}{\\sqrt{(R+R_L)^2 + (\\omega CRR_L)^2}}$.\nThe attenuation requirement (Constraint 2) is:\n$$\\frac{R_L}{\\sqrt{(R+R_L)^2 + (\\omega CRR_L)^2}} \\le \\frac{r_{\\mathrm{req}}}{r_0} \\frac{R_L}{R + R_L}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{\\omega CRR_L}{R+R_L}\\right)^2}} \\le \\frac{r_{\\mathrm{req}}}{r_0} \\approx 0.6622$$\nLet $K = r_{\\mathrm{req}}/r_0$. The inequality becomes $1+x^2 \\ge 1/K^2$, where $x = \\frac{\\omega CRR_L}{R+R_L}$.\n$$x \\ge \\sqrt{K^{-2} - 1} = \\sqrt{(1/0.6622)^2 - 1} = \\sqrt{2.2798-1} = \\sqrt{1.2798} \\approx 1.131$$\nSo, for $N=1$, we need to find $R$ and $C$ such that:\n(a) $R \\le R_L/19$.\n(b) $\\frac{\\omega CRR_L}{R+R_L} \\ge 1.131$.\n(c) $\\omega RC \\ge 10$.\n\nLet's check for feasibility. From (c), we can write $\\omega C \\ge 10/R$. Substituting this minimum value into (b):\n$$\\frac{(10/R)RR_L}{R+R_L} \\ge 1.131 \\implies \\frac{10R_L}{R+R_L} \\ge 1.131 \\implies 10 \\ge 1.131\\left(1+\\frac{R}{R_L}\\right)$$\n$$1 + \\frac{R}{R_L} \\le \\frac{10}{1.131} \\approx 8.841 \\implies \\frac{R}{R_L} \\le 7.841$$\nConstraint (a) requires $R/R_L \\le 1/19 \\approx 0.0526$.\nSince $0.0526 \\le 7.841$, there is a valid range for $R$. For example, we can choose the maximum allowed resistance $R = R_L/19 = 20/19 \\approx 1.053\\,\\Omega$ to minimize the required capacitance. With this $R$, we then choose $C$ to satisfy $\\omega RC \\ge 10$.\n$$C \\ge \\frac{10}{\\omega R} = \\frac{10}{200\\pi \\times (20/19)} \\approx \\frac{10}{661.4} \\approx 0.01512\\,\\mathrm{F} = 15120\\,\\mathrm{\\mu F}$$\nSuch a design exists for $N=1$. Since the problem asks for the smallest integer $N$, and we have found a valid design for $N=1$, this is the minimal order.\n\nTo confirm, the selected component values $R=R_L/19$ and a $C$ such that $\\omega RC \\ge 10$ satisfy:\n1. DC Drop: $R=R_L/19$, so $R_\\Sigma$ is at its maximum allowable limit.\n2. Attenuation: The condition $\\frac{R}{R_L} \\le 7.841$ is met, so a large enough $C$ will provide sufficient attenuation.\n3. Self-Consistency: The design is based on choosing a $C$ large enough to ensure the approximation condition $\\omega RC \\ge 10$ is met.\n\nTherefore, the smallest integer filter order is $N=1$.",
