            "solution": "The bridge is supplied by a balanced three-phase sinusoidal source with phase voltages $v_{a}(t)=V_{m}\\sin(\\omega_{s}t)$, $v_{b}(t)=V_{m}\\sin(\\omega_{s}t-\\frac{2\\pi}{3})$, and $v_{c}(t)=V_{m}\\sin(\\omega_{s}t+\\frac{2\\pi}{3})$, where $\\omega_{s}=2\\pi f_{s}$. In a three-phase six-pulse line-commutated bridge feeding a strictly continuous current load with negligible source inductance (hence negligible commutation overlap), the following well-tested facts govern conduction:\n\n1. At any instant, exactly two SCRs conduct: one from the upper group (connected to a phase anode toward the positive terminal) and one from the lower group (connected to a phase cathode toward the negative terminal), establishing a current path between two phases through the load.\n\n2. With continuous current, once an SCR is turned on (gated when its anode-to-cathode is forward biased and the gate is applied), it remains conducting until current is naturally transferred (line commutated) to the next SCR on the same group when that next device is gated and its phase becomes the appropriate polarity to take over conduction.\n\n3. In a balanced sinusoidal system, the pair of conducting devices that produces the maximum instantaneous line-to-line voltage on the output changes at regular intervals of $60^{\\circ}$ (i.e., $\\pi/3$ radians). This is because the three line-to-line voltages are sinusoidal, phase-shifted by $60^{\\circ}$ relative to each other, and their equality/ordering crossings occur every $60^{\\circ}$.\n\nTo apply these principles, consider the standard numbering of devices in a six-pulse bridge: three upper devices $T_{1}$, $T_{2}$, $T_{3}$ associated with phases $a$, $b$, $c$, and three lower devices $T_{4}$, $T_{5}$, $T_{6}$ associated similarly with phases $a$, $b$, $c$ but connected in the return leg. The gating sequence is uniformly spaced by $\\pi/3$ radians over the electrical period. Let the firing angle for each device be $\\alpha$ (in radians), measured from the instant at which its phase-to-neutral voltage would begin to forward-bias it.\n\nBecause the load current is strictly continuous, when a device $T_{k}$ in the upper group is turned on at some electrical angle, it continues to conduct until the subsequent upper device in the sequence is turned on and takes over the current path. The upper devices are gated sequentially every $\\pi/3$ radians. However, each upper device supplies current for two such $60^{\\circ}$ intervals before being turned off, which yields a total conduction angle of $2\\times\\frac{\\pi}{3}=\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ radians, i.e., $120^{\\circ}$. An identical argument applies to the lower devices.\n\nThis $120^{\\circ}$ conduction per device is a direct consequence of:\n- continuous current (no extinction prior to natural commutation),\n- ideal line commutation (commutation occurs at the next gating event without overlap due to negligible source inductance),\n- the periodicity of the three-phase sinusoidal system, where conduction state transitions occur every $\\pi/3$ radians.\n\nIt is important to note that the firing angle $\\alpha$ shifts the instant when each device begins conduction but does not alter the duration of conduction under these ideal conditions. The duration remains fixed at $120^{\\circ}$ per device because the next two gating events on the same group occur at $\\pi/3$ and $2\\pi/3$ radians later, and the second of these terminates conduction of the original device.\n\nTo convert conduction angle to time, use the relationship between angle and time for a sinusoid:\n$$\n\\theta=\\omega_{s} t, \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\omega_{s}=2\\pi f_{s}.\n$$\nA conduction angle of $\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ radians corresponds to a time duration\n$$\n\\Delta t=\\frac{\\frac{2\\pi}{3}}{\\omega_{s}}=\\frac{\\frac{2\\pi}{3}}{2\\pi f_{s}}=\\frac{1}{3 f_{s}}.\n$$\nThis result is independent of $\\alpha$ under the stated assumptions.\n\nTherefore, each of the six SCRs conducts for the same duration $\\Delta t=\\frac{1}{3 f_{s}}$ in seconds over each supply period.

The cycloconverter is commanded to produce a low-frequency output reference $v_{o}^{\\star}(t) = V_{o} \\sin(\\omega_{o} t)$ with angular frequency $\\omega_{o}$ and amplitude $V_{o}$, using cosine-wave crossing modulation: during each half-cycle of the source, the firing angle $\\alpha(t)$ of the active bridge is varied so that the average over that half-cycle equals the instantaneous reference $v_{o}^{\\star}(t)$ at the center of the half-cycle.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of power electronics and circuit theory, well-posed with sufficient information and clear objectives, and framed using objective, formal language. The assumptions provided are standard idealizations for analyzing the fundamental behavior of such a system.\n\nThe problem asks for an analysis of a single-phase, circulating-current-free cycloconverter under two different load conditions. A cycloconverter synthesizes a low-frequency alternating voltage from a higher-frequency source by using phase-controlled rectifiers. In this configuration, two antiparallel full-wave bridges, a positive converter (P-converter) and a negative converter (N-converter), are used. The P-converter produces a controllable positive voltage, and the N-converter produces a controllable negative voltage. The core principle of control is to modulate the firing angle $\\alpha$ of the thyristors in the active bridge to make the low-frequency component of the output voltage, $v_{o}(t)$, track a sinusoidal reference, $v_{o}^{\\star}(t) = V_{o} \\sin(\\omega_{o} t)$. We are given that the high-frequency components are filtered, so we can assume the observable output voltage is $v_{o}(t) = v_{o}^{\\star}(t)$.\n\n1. Case 1: Purely Resistive Load\n\nFor a purely resistive load with resistance $R$, the output current $i_{o}(t)$ is directly proportional to the output voltage $v_{o}(t)$ according to Ohm's law, $v_{o}(t) = R i_{o}(t)$. Consequently, the output current is always in phase with the output voltage.\n\nQualitative Explanation of Gating Strategy:\nIn a circulating-current-free cycloconverter, only one of the two converter bridges (P or N) is active at any given time to prevent a short circuit across the source. The selection of which bridge to activate depends on the required direction of current flow.\n- When the reference voltage $v_{o}^{\\star}(t)$ is positive, for $0 < \\omega_{o} t < \\pi$, the output voltage $v_{o}(t)$ must be positive. For a resistive load, a positive voltage implies a positive current, $i_{o}(t) > 0$. The P-converter is capable of sourcing positive current, so it is gated on, while the N-converter is blocked. The firing angle $\\alpha(t)$ of the P-converter is modulated, typically in the range $0 \\le \\alpha \\le \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, to produce the desired instantaneous average voltage.\n- When the reference voltage $v_{o}^{\\star}(t)$ is negative, for $\\pi < \\omega_{o} t < 2\\pi$, the output voltage $v_{o}(t)$ must be negative. This requires a negative current, $i_{o}(t) < 0$, in the resistive load. The N-converter is designed to source negative current (or sink positive current), so it is gated on, and the P-converter is blocked. The firing angle of the N-converter is modulated to track the negative voltage reference.\nBecause the current and voltage are in phase, they cross zero simultaneously. At each zero-crossing of $v_{o}(t)$, the load current naturally falls to zero, allowing for a safe and natural commutation from one bridge to the other without the risk of circulating currents. The gating logic can therefore be simplified to depend only on the polarity of the voltage reference $v_{o}^{\\star}(t)$.\n\nDerivation of Low-Frequency Waveforms:\nGiven the assumption that the observable low-frequency output voltage perfectly tracks the reference:\n$$ v_{o}(t) = V_{o} \\sin(\\omega_{o} t) $$\nUsing the constitutive relation for a resistor (Ohm's Law), $v_{o}(t) = R i_{o}(t)$, we can derive the output current $i_{o}(t)$:\n$$ i_{o}(t) = \\frac{v_{o}(t)}{R} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $v_{o}(t)$:\n$$ i_{o}(t) = \\frac{V_{o}}{R} \\sin(\\omega_{o} t) $$\nThe waveforms $v_{o}(t)$ and $i_{o}(t)$ are sinusoidal and in phase.\n\n2. Case 2: Series Resistive-Inductive (RL) Load\n\nFor a series RL load with resistance $R$ and inductance $L$, the relationship between voltage and current is described by a differential equation. The inductor causes the current to lag the voltage.\n\nQualitative Explanation of Adapted Gating Strategy:\nThe phase lag between current and voltage introduces a significant complication. The simple gating strategy based on the voltage reference polarity is no longer viable. For example, when the output voltage $v_{o}(t)$ crosses from positive to negative (at $\\omega_{o} t = \\pi$), the energy stored in the inductor will cause the current $i_{o}(t)$ to remain positive for a period of time.\n- If the P-converter were disabled and the N-converter enabled at the voltage zero-crossing, there would be no path for the persistent positive load current, leading to a hazardous voltage spike. Alternatively, if both were gated, a line-to-line short circuit would occur.\n- Therefore, the gating logic must be adapted to select the active bridge based on the direction of the output current $i_{o}(t)$, not the polarity of the output voltage $v_{o}(t)$. The rule is:\n    - If $i_{o}(t) > 0$, the P-converter must be gated.\n    - If $i_{o}(t) < 0$, the N-converter must be gated.\n- Consider the interval where $v_{o}(t) < 0$ but $i_{o}(t) > 0$ (just after the voltage zero-crossing). The P-converter remains active to conduct the positive current. However, to produce a negative voltage, the converter must operate in *inversion mode*. This is achieved by setting its firing angle $\\alpha(t)$ to be greater than $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. In this mode, the converter transfers power from the load back to the AC source, which is necessary to force the inductor current to decrease towards zero.\n- Symmetrically, when $v_{o}(t) > 0$ but $i_{o}(t) < 0$, the N-converter remains active and operates in its inversion mode to produce a positive voltage while conducting negative current.\nThis strategy ensures current continuity and prevents circulating currents, allowing the cycloconverter to supply a load with an arbitrary power factor.\n\nDerivation of Low-Frequency Waveforms and Displacement Angle:\nWe again start with the idealized output voltage:\n$$ v_{o}(t) = V_{o} \\sin(\\omega_{o} t) $$\nAccording to Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) applied to the series RL load, the output voltage is the sum of the voltage drops across the resistor and the inductor:\n$$ v_{o}(t) = R i_{o}(t) + L \\frac{d i_{o}(t)}{dt} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $v_{o}(t)$, we obtain the first-order linear ordinary differential equation for the steady-state current $i_{o}(t)$:\n$$ V_{o} \\sin(\\omega_{o} t) = R i_{o}(t) + L \\frac{d i_{o}(t)}{dt} $$\nTo find the steady-state solution, we use the phasor method. In the frequency domain, a time-domain function $A \\sin(\\omega t + \\theta)$ is represented by a phasor $\\mathbf{A} = A e^{j\\theta}$. The derivative operation $\\frac{d}{dt}$ corresponds to multiplication by $j\\omega_{o}$. The differential equation becomes an algebraic equation in terms of phasors:\n$$ \\mathbf{V_{o}} = R \\mathbf{I_{o}} + j\\omega_{o} L \\mathbf{I_{o}} $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{V_{o}}$ and $\\mathbf{I_{o}}$ are the phasors for the voltage and current, respectively. Factoring out $\\mathbf{I_{o}}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{V_{o}} = (R + j\\omega_{o} L) \\mathbf{I_{o}} $$\nThe term $Z = R + j\\omega_{o} L$ is the complex impedance of the load. The relationship between the current and voltage phasors is $\\mathbf{I_{o}} = \\frac{\\mathbf{V_{o}}}{Z}$.\nThe displacement angle $\\varphi$ is the phase difference between the voltage and current. It is given by the angle of the impedance $Z$:\n$$ \\varphi = \\arg(Z) = \\arg(R + j\\omega_{o} L) $$\nThe argument of a complex number $x + jy$ is $\\arctan(\\frac{y}{x})$. Therefore, the displacement angle is:\n$$ \\varphi = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\omega_{o} L}{R}\\right) $$\nThis angle $\\varphi$ represents the amount by which the current $i_{o}(t)$ lags the voltage $v_{o}(t)$. The steady-state output current waveform is:\n$$ i_{o}(t) = I_{o} \\sin(\\omega_{o} t - \\varphi) $$\nwhere the amplitude is $I_{o} = \\frac{V_{o}}{|Z|} = \\frac{V_{o}}{\\sqrt{R^2 + (\\omega_{o} L)^2}}$ and the phase lag is $\\varphi = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\omega_{o} L}{R}\\right)$.\n\nThe problem asks for the displacement angle $\\varphi$ for the resistive-inductive load. Based on the derivation above, this is the final expression to be provided.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is a valid, well-posed problem in the field of power electronics. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of AC-AC conversion using line-commutated cycloconverters and is free of any invalidating flaws. We may therefore proceed with a formal derivation and solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive and implement an algorithm to compute the firing delay angles, $\\alpha$, for the thyristors of a three-phase to single-phase cycloconverter operating under cosine-wave crossing control.\n\n### Step 1: Fundamental Relationships of the Three-Phase System\n\nA balanced three-phase AC supply with line-to-line RMS voltage $V_{LL,\\mathrm{rms}}$ and angular frequency $\\omega_i$ is provided. The peak line-to-line voltage, $V_{LL,peak}$, is given by:\n$$ V_{LL,peak} = \\sqrt{2} V_{LL,\\mathrm{rms}} $$\n\n### Step 2: Ideal Six-Pulse Bridge Output Voltage\n\nThe cycloconverter consists of two antiparallel three-phase, six-pulse thyristor bridges. Each bridge functions as a controlled rectifier. For a six-pulse bridge operating with continuous load current and negligible commutation overlap, the average DC output voltage, $V_d$, as a function of the firing delay angle $\\alpha$ is given by the well-established formula:\n$$ V_d(\\alpha) = V_{d0} \\cos(\\alpha) $$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the delay angle measured from the natural commutation point of each thyristor. The theoretical maximum average DC voltage, $V_{d0}$, (obtained at $\\alpha=0$) is:\n$$ V_{d0} = \\frac{3 V_{LL,peak}}{\\pi} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{2} V_{LL,\\mathrm{rms}}}{\\pi} $$\nThis voltage $V_{d0}$ represents the maximum average voltage magnitude the converter can produce. The firing angle $\\alpha$ can vary from $0$ (full rectification) to $\\pi$ (full inversion).\n\n### Step 3: Cosine-Wave Crossing Control Principle\n\nThe cycloconverter synthesizes a low-frequency AC output voltage, $v_o(t)$, by rapidly modulating the firing angles of the thyristor bridges. The desired output is a sinusoid:\n$$ v_o(t) = V_o \\sin(\\omega_o t + \\phi) $$\nwhere $V_o$ is the desired output amplitude, $\\omega_o = 2\\pi f_o$ is the output angular frequency, and $\\phi$ is a phase offset.\n\nCosine-wave crossing control aims to make the average voltage produced by the active bridge over a short interval equal to the desired instantaneous voltage $v_o(t)$. The two bridges, positive group (P) and negative group (N), are enabled based on the sign of the desired voltage $v_o(t)$.\n- If $v_o(t) \\ge 0$, the positive group is active. Its output voltage is positive. We must set its firing angle $\\alpha_p$ such that its average output matches the reference:\n  $$ v_o(t) = V_d(\\alpha_p) = V_{d0} \\cos(\\alpha_p) $$\n- If $v_o(t) < 0$, the negative group is active. This bridge is connected in antiparallel, so its natural output voltage is negative with respect to the load. We set its firing angle $\\alpha_n$ such that its average output matches the reference:\n  $$ v_o(t) = -V_d(\\alpha_n) = -V_{d0} \\cos(\\alpha_n) $$\n\nFrom these two conditions, we can derive a single control law for the magnitude of the firing angle.\nFor the positive group ($v_o(t) \\ge 0$):\n$$ \\cos(\\alpha_p) = \\frac{v_o(t)}{V_{d0}} \\implies \\alpha_p = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{v_o(t)}{V_{d0}}\\right) $$\nFor the negative group ($v_o(t) < 0$):\n$$ \\cos(\\alpha_n) = -\\frac{v_o(t)}{V_{d0}} = \\frac{|v_o(t)|}{V_{d0}} \\implies \\alpha_n = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{|v_o(t)|}{V_{d0}}\\right) $$\nCombining these, the firing angle for the active group at any time $t$ is given by:\n$$ \\alpha(t) = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{|v_o(t)|}{V_{d0}}\\right) $$\nThe argument of the arccosine function, $|v_o(t)|/V_{d0}$, cannot exceed $1$. If the desired voltage magnitude $|v_o(t)|$ exceeds the converter's capability $V_{d0}$, saturation occurs. The control law must be modified to handle this by clipping the argument to $1$. Let $u(t) = |v_o(t)|/V_{d0}$.\n$$ \\alpha(t) = \\arccos(\\min(u(t), 1.0)) $$\nIf saturation occurs (i.e., $u(t) \\ge 1$), the firing angle becomes $\\alpha = \\arccos(1) = 0$, which correctly commands the converter to produce its maximum possible output magnitude.\n\n### Step 4: Discretization and Algorithmic Implementation\n\nThe control law is applied at discrete time instants corresponding to the firing opportunities for the thyristors. For a six-pulse bridge, there are $6$ such opportunities per input cycle of frequency $f_i$. These occur at intervals of $\\pi/3$ radians of the input frequency. The discrete sampling instants $t_n$ are given as:\n$$ t_n = n \\frac{\\pi/3}{\\omega_i} = n \\frac{\\pi/3}{2\\pi f_i} = \\frac{n}{6f_i} $$\nThe computation is performed over one full low-frequency cycle, $T_o = 1/f_o$. The total number of sampling instants, $N$, is the number of input pulses per output cycle:\n$$ N = 6 \\times \\frac{T_o}{T_i} = 6 \\frac{f_i}{f_o} $$\nThe problem statement guarantees that the ratio $f_i/f_o$ is an integer, so $N$ is an integer. The loop runs for $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, N-1$.\n\nThe specific thyristor to be fired at instant $t_n$ is determined by a cyclic sequence. The device index $d$ (from $1$ to $6$) is given by:\n$$ d = 1 + (n \\pmod 6) $$\n\nThe complete algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Given $V_{LL,\\mathrm{rms}}$, $f_i$, $f_o$, $V_o$, $\\phi$.\n2.  Calculate constants:\n    -   $\\omega_o = 2\\pi f_o$\n    -   $V_{d0} = (3\\sqrt{2} V_{LL,\\mathrm{rms}})/\\pi$\n    -   $N = 6 (f_i/f_o)$\n3.  Initialize empty lists for the firing angles of each of the $6$ thyristors in the positive group and $6$ in the negative group. `positive_group_angles = [[] for _ in range(6)]`, `negative_group_angles = [[] for _ in range(6)]`.\n4.  Loop for $n$ from $0$ to $N-1$:\n    a.  Calculate the sampling time: $t_n = n / (6f_i)$.\n    b.  Calculate the instantaneous reference voltage: $v_{ref} = V_o \\sin(\\omega_o t_n + \\phi)$.\n    c.  Determine the active bridge group:\n        -   If $v_{ref} \\ge 0$, the positive group is active.\n        -   If $v_{ref} < 0$, the negative group is active.\n    d.  Calculate the normalized voltage magnitude for the control law: $u = |v_{ref}| / V_{d0}$.\n    e.  Saturate the control signal: $u_{sat} = \\min(u, 1.0)$.\n    f.  Calculate the firing delay angle: $\\alpha_n = \\arccos(u_{sat})$.\n    g.  Determine the thyristor device index: $d = 1 + (n \\pmod 6)$. The list index is $d-1$.\n    h.  Store the computed angle:\n        -   If the positive group is active, append $\\alpha_n$ to `positive_group_angles[d-1]`.\n        -   If the negative group is active, append $\\alpha_n$ to `negative_group_angles[d-1]`.\n5.  After the loop, the lists contain the sequences of firing angles for each device. Each angle is rounded to $6$ decimal places as required. The final result is a nested list containing the populated angle lists for both groups.",
