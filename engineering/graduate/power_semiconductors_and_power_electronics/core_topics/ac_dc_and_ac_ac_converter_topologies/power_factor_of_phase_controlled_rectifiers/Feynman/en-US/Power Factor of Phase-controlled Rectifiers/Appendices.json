            "problem": "A single-phase, full-controlled bridge rectifier (Graetz bridge) with ideal Silicon Controlled Rectifiers (SCRs) feeds a highly inductive direct current (DC) load such that the DC current is effectively ripple-free and equal to a specified constant $I_{d}$. The alternating current (AC) source is a stiff sinusoid with root mean square (RMS) voltage $V_{\\mathrm{rms}}$. Assume ideal conditions: zero device voltage drop, negligible source inductance, negligible commutation overlap, and perfectly continuous conduction.\n\nLet the source voltage be $v_{s}(t)=V_{m}\\sin(\\omega t)$, with $V_{m}=\\sqrt{2}\\,V_{\\mathrm{rms}}$, and the firing angle be $\\alpha$ (angles must be treated in radians).

It describes a standard, albeit idealized, model of a single-phase full-controlled rectifier, providing all necessary information for a unique and meaningful solution.

At $\\theta = \\pi+\\alpha$, the other pair of SCRs is triggered, reversing the connection of the load to the source. The source current becomes negative, $i_{s}(\\theta) = -I_{d}$, for the interval $\\pi+\\alpha \\le \\theta  2\\pi+\\alpha$.

Derivation of Power Factor ($\\mathrm{PF}$)**\n\nThe Power Factor (PF) is defined as the ratio of the active power $P$ to the apparent power $S = V_{\\mathrm{rms}}I_{\\mathrm{rms}}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PF} = \\frac{P}{V_{\\mathrm{rms}}I_{\\mathrm{rms}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for $P$ and $I_{\\mathrm{rms}}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PF} = \\frac{\\frac{2\\sqrt{2}\\,V_{\\mathrm{rms}}I_{d}}{\\pi}\\cos\\alpha}{V_{\\mathrm{rms}} \\cdot I_{d}}\n$$\nThe terms $V_{\\mathrm{rms}}$ and $I_{d}$ cancel, yielding the analytical expression for the Power Factor:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PF} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi}\\cos\\alpha\n$$\nThis expression shows that the power factor is composed of two parts: a constant distortion factor of $2\\sqrt{2}/\\pi$ due to the non-sinusoidal current waveform, and a displacement factor $\\cos\\alpha$ due to the phase shift between the fundamental components of voltage and current.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\n\nThe problem provides the following numerical values:\n- $V_{\\mathrm{rms}} = 230~\\mathrm{V}$\n- $I_{d} = 50.00~\\mathrm{A}$\n- $\\alpha = \\pi/4~\\mathrm{rad}$\n\nWe evaluate the derived expressions using these parameters.\n\n- **Active Power ($P$)**:\nSince $\\cos(\\pi/4) = \\sqrt{2}/2$, the expression for power simplifies:\n$$\nP = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}\\,(230)\\,(50.00)}{\\pi}\\cos(\\pi/4) = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}\\,(230)\\,(50.00)}{\\pi} \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2 \\cdot (230) \\cdot (50.00)}{\\pi} = \\frac{23000}{\\pi} \\, \\mathrm{W}\n$$\n$$\nP \\approx 7320.556~\\mathrm{W} \\approx 7.320556~\\mathrm{kW}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $P = 7.321~\\mathrm{kW}$.\n\n- **RMS Current ($I_{\\mathrm{rms}}$)**:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{rms}} = I_{d} = 50.00~\\mathrm{A}\n$$\nThe value is already provided with four significant figures.\n\n- **Power Factor ($\\mathrm{PF}$)**:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PF} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi}\\cos(\\pi/4) = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi} \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{PF} \\approx 0.63661977\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\mathrm{PF} = 0.6366$.",

A solution will be derived based on fundamental principles as instructed.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe input power factor ($PF$) on the alternating current (AC) side is defined as the ratio of the total real power ($P$) to the total apparent power ($S$).\n$$PF = \\frac{P}{S}$$\n\nFirst, we determine the real power, $P$. Assuming negligible losses in the rectifier, the real power drawn from the AC source is equal to the power delivered to the direct current (DC) load.\n$$P = P_{dc} = V_d I_d$$\nwhere $V_d$ is the average DC output voltage and $I_d$ is the average DC current. For a three-phase, six-pulse fully controlled bridge rectifier, the average DC voltage is given by the formula:\n$$V_d = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{2} V_{LL,\\mathrm{rms}}}{\\pi} \\cos(\\alpha)$$\nwhere $V_{LL,\\mathrm{rms}}$ is the line-to-line RMS voltage of the AC source and $\\alpha$ is the firing angle.\nSubstituting this expression for $V_d$ into the power equation yields:\n$$P = \\left( \\frac{3 \\sqrt{2} V_{LL,\\mathrm{rms}}}{\\pi} \\cos(\\alpha) \\right) I_d$$\n\nNext, we determine the apparent power, $S$. For a balanced three-phase system, the apparent power is given by:\n$$S = \\sqrt{3} V_{LL,\\mathrm{rms}} I_{L,\\mathrm{rms}}$$\nwhere $I_{L,\\mathrm{rms}}$ is the RMS value of the AC line current. For a six-pulse rectifier with a highly inductive load, the input line current waveform is a quasi-square wave. Each phase conducts for two $120^\\circ$ blocks per cycle, with an amplitude equal to the constant DC current $I_d$. The current is $+I_d$ for $120^\\circ$ ($2\\pi/3$ radians), $-I_d$ for $120^\\circ$ ($2\\pi/3$ radians), and zero for the remaining $120^\\circ$. The RMS value of this waveform is calculated as:\n$$I_{L,\\mathrm{rms}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} i_a^2(\\omega t) d(\\omega t)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left[ I_d^2 \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) + (-I_d)^2 \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) \\right]}$$\n$$I_{L,\\mathrm{rms}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{I_d^2}{2\\pi} \\left( \\frac{4\\pi}{3} \\right)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3} I_d^2} = I_d \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $I_{L,\\mathrm{rms}}$ into the apparent power equation gives:\n$$S = \\sqrt{3} V_{LL,\\mathrm{rms}} \\left( I_d \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}} \\right) = \\sqrt{2} V_{LL,\\mathrm{rms}} I_d$$\n\nNow, we can compute the power factor by taking the ratio of $P$ to $S$:\n$$PF = \\frac{P}{S} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{3 \\sqrt{2} V_{LL,\\mathrm{rms}}}{\\pi} \\cos(\\alpha) \\right) I_d}{\\sqrt{2} V_{LL,\\mathrm{rms}} I_d}$$\nThe terms $V_{LL,\\mathrm{rms}}$, $I_d$, and $\\sqrt{2}$ cancel, yielding a simplified expression for the power factor that depends only on the firing angle:\n$$PF = \\frac{3}{\\pi} \\cos(\\alpha)$$\n\nThis formula can also be understood as the product of the distortion factor ($DF$) and the displacement power factor ($DPF$). For this rectifier, $DPF = \\cos(\\alpha)$ (the cosine of the angle between fundamental voltage and current) and the theoretical distortion factor is $DF = 3/\\pi$. The problem provides $DF \\approx 0.955$, which is the numerical approximation of $3/\\pi$. Our derived formula is therefore consistent with this decomposition.\n\nWe are given the firing angle $\\alpha = 20^\\circ$. We use degrees for the trigonometric function as specified.\n$$PF = \\frac{3}{\\pi} \\cos(20^\\circ)$$\nUsing a calculator, $\\cos(20^\\circ) \\approx 0.93969262$.\n$$PF \\approx \\frac{3}{3.14159265} \\times 0.93969262 \\approx 0.95492966 \\times 0.93969262$$\n$$PF \\approx 0.8973398$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get:\n$$PF \\approx 0.8973$$\n\n**Physical Interpretation**\nThe computed power factor of approximately $0.8973$ is significantly less than unity. This signifies that the AC source must supply an apparent power ($S$) that is larger than the real power ($P$) consumed by the DC load. The ratio $S/P = 1/PF \\approx 1.114$, meaning the source and distribution network must be rated for about $11.4\\%$ more current-carrying capacity than if the load were purely resistive with a unity power factor.\n\nThis reduction from unity is attributable to two independent factors:\n$1$. **Displacement**: The firing angle $\\alpha = 20^\\circ$ causes the fundamental component of the input current to lag the phase voltage by $20^\\circ$. This creates a reactive power demand. The effect is quantified by the displacement power factor, $DPF = \\cos(\\alpha) = \\cos(20^\\circ) \\approx 0.9397$.\n$2$. **Distortion**: The input current waveform is not sinusoidal but a quasi-square wave. This non-sinusoidal shape implies the presence of current harmonics (at frequencies $6k \\pm 1$ times the fundamental, for $k=1, 2, 3, ...$). These harmonics contribute to the total RMS current and thus to the apparent power, but they do not transfer any average real power. This effect is quantified by the distortion factor, $DF$. For an ideal six-pulse rectifier, $DF = 3/\\pi \\approx 0.955$, which matches the value given in the problem.\n\nThe total power factor is the product of these two factors: $PF = DPF \\times DF \\approx 0.9397 \\times 0.955 \\approx 0.8974$. The minor difference from the more precise calculation is due to rounding the $DF$ value. The power quality is thus degraded by both a phase shift and harmonic distortion inherent to the operation of the phase-controlled rectifier.",

The voltage is $v_{s}(\\theta) = V_{m}\\sin(\\theta) = \\sqrt{2}V_{\\mathrm{rms}}\\sin(\\theta)$.\nFor a single-phase full-controlled rectifier with continuous conduction, the AC-side current $i_{s}(\\theta)$ is a square wave phase-shifted by $\\alpha$:\n$$ i_s(\\theta) = \\begin{cases} +I_d  \\text{for } \\alpha \\le \\theta  \\pi+\\alpha \\\\ -I_d  \\text{for } \\pi+\\alpha \\le \\theta  2\\pi+\\alpha \\end{cases} $$\nThe integral for $P$ can now be computed:\n$$P = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left[ \\int_{\\alpha}^{\\pi+\\alpha} (\\sqrt{2}V_{\\mathrm{rms}}\\sin\\theta)(I_{d}) d\\theta + \\int_{\\pi+\\alpha}^{2\\pi+\\alpha} (\\sqrt{2}V_{\\mathrm{rms}}\\sin\\theta)(-I_{d}) d\\theta \\right]$$\n$$P = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}V_{\\mathrm{rms}}I_{d}}{2\\pi} \\left[ \\int_{\\alpha}^{\\pi+\\alpha} \\sin\\theta \\,d\\theta - \\int_{\\pi+\\alpha}^{2\\pi+\\alpha} \\sin\\theta \\,d\\theta \\right]$$\nEvaluating the integrals:\n$$P = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}V_{\\mathrm{rms}}I_{d}}{2\\pi} \\left[ [-\\cos\\theta]_{\\alpha}^{\\pi+\\alpha} - [-\\cos\\theta]_{\\pi+\\alpha}^{2\\pi+\\alpha} \\right]$$\n$$P = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}V_{\\mathrm{rms}}I_{d}}{2\\pi} \\left[ (-\\cos(\\pi+\\alpha) - (-\\cos\\alpha)) - (-\\cos(2\\pi+\\alpha) - (-\\cos(\\pi+\\alpha))) \\right]$$\nUsing trigonometric identities $\\cos(\\pi+\\alpha) = -\\cos\\alpha$ and $\\cos(2\\pi+\\alpha) = \\cos\\alpha$:\n$$P = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}V_{\\mathrm{rms}}I_{d}}{2\\pi} \\left[ (\\cos\\alpha + \\cos\\alpha) - (-\\cos\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha) \\right]$$\n$$P = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}V_{\\mathrm{rms}}I_{d}}{2\\pi} \\left[ 2\\cos\\alpha - (-2\\cos\\alpha) \\right] = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}V_{\\mathrm{rms}}I_{d}}{2\\pi} [4\\cos\\alpha]$$\n$$P = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi}V_{\\mathrm{rms}}I_{d}\\cos\\alpha$$\n\n**3. Power Factor, $PF$**\nNow we can compute the power factor:\n$$PF = \\frac{P}{S} = \\frac{\\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi}V_{\\mathrm{rms}}I_{d}\\cos\\alpha}{V_{\\mathrm{rms}}I_{d}}$$\n$$PF = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi}\\cos\\alpha$$\nThis expression relates the power factor to the firing angle $\\alpha$. Note that the term $\\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi}$ is the Distortion Factor ($DF$) given in the problem, and $\\cos\\alpha$ is the Displacement Power Factor ($DPF$). So, $PF = DF \\times DPF$. The given value of $DF$ is consistent with our derivation.\n\n**4. Allowable Range for $\\alpha$**\nThe problem requires us to find the allowable range of $\\alpha$ that satisfies two conditions:\n1. Rectifier operation.\n2. $PF \\ge 0.9$.\n\nFor rectifier operation, the average power must flow from the AC source to the DC load, meaning $P \\ge 0$. From the expression for $P$, this implies $\\cos\\alpha \\ge 0$. For the typical control range $0 \\le \\alpha \\le \\pi$, this restricts the firing angle to $0 \\le \\alpha \\le \\pi/2$.\n\nThe second condition is $PF \\ge 0.9$. Using our derived expression for $PF$:\n$$\\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi}\\cos\\alpha \\ge 0.9$$\nSolving for $\\cos\\alpha$:\n$$\\cos\\alpha \\ge 0.9 \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2\\sqrt{2}}\\right)$$\nWe must find the range of $\\alpha$ that satisfies both $0 \\le \\alpha \\le \\pi/2$ and this inequality. Since $0.9 \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2\\sqrt{2}}\\right)$ is positive, any $\\alpha$ satisfying the second condition will automatically have $\\cos\\alpha  0$, thus satisfying the rectifier operation condition.\nThe function $\\cos\\alpha$ is a decreasing function of $\\alpha$ in the interval $[0, \\pi/2]$. Therefore, the inequality for $\\cos\\alpha$ sets an upper bound on $\\alpha$. The lower bound is $\\alpha=0$, which corresponds to the maximum power factor.\n\nThe range for $\\alpha$ is therefore:\n$$0 \\le \\alpha \\le \\arccos\\left(0.9 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{2\\sqrt{2}}\\right)$$\nThe minimum value is $\\alpha_{\\min} = 0$.\nThe maximum value is $\\alpha_{\\max} = \\arccos\\left(0.9 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{2\\sqrt{2}}\\right)$.\nWe now compute the numerical value of $\\alpha_{\\max}$:\n$$\\alpha_{\\max} = \\arccos\\left(0.9 \\times \\frac{3.14159265...}{2 \\times 1.41421356...}\\right)$$\n$$\\alpha_{\\max} = \\arccos(0.9 \\times 1.11072073...) = \\arccos(0.99964866...)$$\n$$\\alpha_{\\max} \\approx 0.02650505... \\text{ radians}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\\alpha_{\\max} \\approx 0.02651 \\text{ radians}$$\n\nThe allowable range for $\\alpha$ is $[0, 0.02651]$. This is expressed as a two-entry row vector $[\\alpha_{\\min}\\ \\alpha_{\\max}]$.",
