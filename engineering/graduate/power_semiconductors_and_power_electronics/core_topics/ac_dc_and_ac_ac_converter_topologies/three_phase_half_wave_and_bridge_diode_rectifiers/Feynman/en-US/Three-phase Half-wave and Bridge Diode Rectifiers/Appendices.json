A unique and meaningful solution exists under the specified model.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, unbiased technical language with no subjective elements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is a standard problem in the analysis of power electronic converters. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to find the average and root-mean-square (RMS) current through a single diode in a six-pulse bridge rectifier. Let the angular frequency be $\\omega$, such that one electrical period $T$ corresponds to an angle of $2\\pi$ radians, where $\\theta = \\omega t$.\n\nFirst, we establish the definitions for the average and RMS values of a periodic current $i(\\theta)$ with period $2\\pi$:\nThe average value is given by:\n$$I_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} i(\\theta) \\, d\\theta$$\nThe RMS value is given by:\n$$I_{\\text{RMS}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} i^2(\\theta) \\, d\\theta}$$\n\nNext, we must characterize the current waveform through a single diode, which we denote as $i_D(\\theta)$. The problem states that the DC-side current $I_{dc}$ is strictly constant. By Kirchhoff's current law at the DC output node, the current entering the DC load, $I_{dc}$, is the sum of currents from the conducting diodes. Due to the bridge configuration, at any instant, one diode from the upper group and one from the lower group are conducting. A diode in the upper group conducts if its associated phase voltage is the most positive among the three phases. A diode in the lower group conducts if its phase voltage is the most negative. When a diode is conducting, it carries the entire DC load current $I_{dc}$, because no other diode in its group (upper or lower) is conducting. When a diode is not conducting, its current is zero.\n\nThus, the current waveform $i_D(\\theta)$ for any single diode is a periodic train of rectangular pulses. Each pulse has a magnitude of $I_{dc}$ and a duration equal to the diode's conduction angle, $\\theta_c$.\n\nThe conduction angle $\\theta_c$ for a single diode must be determined. Let us consider a diode in the upper group, for instance, the one connected to phase 'a', $v_a(\\theta)=V_{m}\\sin(\\theta)$. This diode conducts when $v_a$ is greater than both $v_b$ and $v_c$. The crossover points are:\n- $v_a(\\theta) = v_c(\\theta) \\implies V_{m}\\sin(\\theta) = V_{m}\\sin(\\theta - 4\\pi/3)$. This equality holds at $\\theta = \\pi/6$.\n- $v_a(\\theta) = v_b(\\theta) \\implies V_{m}\\sin(\\theta) = V_{m}\\sin(\\theta - 2\\pi/3)$. This equality holds at $\\theta = 5\\pi/6$.\nBetween $\\theta = \\pi/6$ and $\\theta = 5\\pi/6$, the voltage $v_a$ is the highest of the three phase voltages. Therefore, the diode connected to phase 'a' in the upper group conducts throughout this interval. The duration of this interval is the conduction angle $\\theta_c$:\n$$\\theta_c = \\frac{5\\pi}{6} - \\frac{\\pi}{6} = \\frac{4\\pi}{6} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\text{ radians}$$\nBy symmetry, every diode in the rectifier conducts for a duration of $2\\pi/3$ radians, or $1/3$ of the total period. The current waveform $i_D(\\theta)$ for a single diode can be represented over one period, without loss of generality for the calculation, as:\n$$i_D(\\theta) = \\begin{cases} I_{dc} & \\text{for } 0 \\le \\theta < \\theta_c \\\\ 0 & \\text{for } \\theta_c \\le \\theta < 2\\pi \\end{cases}$$\n\nWe can now derive the general expressions for $I_{D,\\text{avg}}$ and $I_{D,\\text{RMS}}$ in terms of $I_{dc}$ and $\\theta_c$.\n\nThe average current through a single diode is:\n$$I_{D,\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} i_D(\\theta) \\, d\\theta = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\theta_c} I_{dc} \\, d\\theta$$\n$$I_{D,\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} [I_{dc}\\theta]_{0}^{\\theta_c} = \\frac{I_{dc}\\theta_c}{2\\pi}$$\n\nThe RMS current through a single diode is found from its mean-square value:\n$$I_{D,\\text{RMS}}^2 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} i_D^2(\\theta) \\, d\\theta = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\theta_c} I_{dc}^2 \\, d\\theta$$\n$$I_{D,\\text{RMS}}^2 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} [I_{dc}^2\\theta]_{0}^{\\theta_c} = \\frac{I_{dc}^2\\theta_c}{2\\pi}$$\nTaking the square root gives the RMS current:\n$$I_{D,\\text{RMS}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{I_{dc}^2\\theta_c}{2\\pi}} = I_{dc}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\theta_c}{2\\pi}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the determined value of the conduction angle, $\\theta_c = 2\\pi/3$, into these general expressions to find the final answers in terms of $I_{dc}$.\n\nFor the average current:\n$$I_{D,\\text{avg}} = \\frac{I_{dc}(2\\pi/3)}{2\\pi} = \\frac{I_{dc}}{3}$$\nThis result is intuitive: the total average current $I_{dc}$ is supplied by three diodes in the upper group, so by symmetry, each carries one-third of the total average current over a full cycle.\n\nFor the RMS current:\n$$I_{D,\\text{RMS}} = I_{dc}\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi/3}{2\\pi}} = I_{dc}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{I_{dc}}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\n\nThe final symbolic expressions for the average and RMS currents through a single diode are $I_{dc}/3$ and $I_{dc}/\\sqrt{3}$, respectively.",

During commutation, the sum of currents is constant: $i_a(t) + i_b(t) = I_d$, so their derivatives sum to zero: $\\frac{di_a}{dt} = -\\frac{di_b}{dt}$. Substituting this into the loop equation gives:\n$$ v_{ba}(t) = 2 L_s \\frac{di_b}{dt} $$\nThe commutation starts at the natural point where $v_{ba}(t)$ crosses zero from negative to positive.

Timing of Line-to-Line Voltage Maxima**\n\nThe total phase voltages are given by $v_x = v_x^+ + v_x^-$.\n$v_{a}(t) = (V_{+} + V_{-}) \\cos(\\omega t)$\n$v_{b}(t) = V_{+} \\cos(\\omega t - 2\\pi/3) + V_{-} \\cos(\\omega t + 2\\pi/3)$\n$v_{c}(t) = V_{+} \\cos(\\omega t + 2\\pi/3) + V_{-} \\cos(\\omega t - 2\\pi/3)$\n\nLet's compute the line-to-line voltage $v_{ab}(t) = v_{a}(t) - v_{b}(t)$.\nThe positive-sequence component is $v_{ab}^+(t) = V_+[\\cos(\\omega t) - \\cos(\\omega t - 2\\pi/3)] = \\sqrt{3}V_+\\cos(\\omega t + \\pi/6)$.\nThe negative-sequence component is $v_{ab}^-(t) = V_-[\\cos(\\omega t) - \\cos(\\omega t + 2\\pi/3)] = \\sqrt{3}V_-\\cos(\\omega t - \\pi/6)$.\nThus, $v_{ab}(t) = \\sqrt{3}V_+[\\cos(\\omega t + \\pi/6) + r \\cos(\\omega t - \\pi/6)]$.\n\nTo find the time of maximum, we set the derivative to zero:\n$\\dfrac{d v_{ab}}{dt} = -\\sqrt{3}V_+\\omega[\\sin(\\omega t + \\pi/6) + r \\sin(\\omega t - \\pi/6)] = 0$.\nThe balanced maximum ($r=0$) occurs when $\\omega t_0 + \\pi/6 = 0 \\implies \\omega t_0 = -\\pi/6$.\nLet the new maximum occur at $\\omega t = \\omega t_0 + \\delta = -\\pi/6 + \\delta$, where $\\delta$ is a small phase shift.\n$\\sin(-\\pi/6 + \\delta + \\pi/6) + r \\sin(-\\pi/6 + \\delta - \\pi/6) = 0$\n$\\sin(\\delta) + r \\sin(\\delta - \\pi/3) = 0$\nFor small $\\delta$, $\\sin(\\delta) \\approx \\delta$.\n$\\delta + r(\\sin\\delta\\cos(\\pi/3) - \\cos\\delta\\sin(\\pi/3)) \\approx 0$\n$\\delta + r(\\delta/2 - (1)\\sqrt{3}/2) \\approx 0$\n$\\delta(1+r/2) \\approx r\\sqrt{3}/2 \\implies \\delta \\approx \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}r$.\nSince $\\delta > 0$, the maximum of $v_{ab}$ is delayed.

We seek a new maximum at $\\omega t = -5\\pi/6 + \\delta$.\nThe derivative condition gives $-\\sin(\\omega t + 5\\pi/6) - r\\sin(\\omega t - 5\\pi/6) = 0$.\nSubstituting $\\omega t = -5\\pi/6 + \\delta$:\n$-\\sin(\\delta) - r\\sin(\\delta - 10\\pi/6) = -\\sin(\\delta) - r\\sin(\\delta + \\pi/3) = 0$.\nFor small $\\delta$: $-\\delta - r(\\delta/2 + \\sqrt{3}/2) \\approx 0 \\implies \\delta(1+r/2) \\approx -r\\sqrt{3}/2 \\implies \\delta \\approx -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}r$.\nSince $\\delta < 0$, the maximum of $v_{ca}$ is advanced in time by $\\Delta t = |\\delta|/\\omega = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2\\omega}r$.\n\n**2. Commutation Instants and Conduction Intervals**\nCommutation occurs when the phase voltages cross. The intervals between these events determine the conduction periods.\n- **$v_a = v_b$ crossover**: In the balanced case, this is at $\\omega t = \\pi/3$. With unbalance, we solve $(V_+ + V_-)\\cos(\\omega t) = V_+\\cos(\\omega t - 2\\pi/3) + V_-\\cos(\\omega t + 2\\pi/3)$.\nThis leads to $\\tan(\\omega t) = \\sqrt{3} \\frac{1+r}{1-r}$. For small $r$, $\\tan(\\omega t) \\approx \\sqrt{3}(1+2r)$. The angle shifts from $\\pi/3$ to $\\pi/3+\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}r$. This is a delay.\n- **$v_b = v_c$ crossover**: In the balanced case, this is at $\\omega t = \\pi$. With unbalance, we solve $V_+\\cos(\\omega t - 2\\pi/3) + V_-\\cos(\\omega t + 2\\pi/3) = V_+\\cos(\\omega t + 2\\pi/3) + V_-\\cos(\\omega t - 2\\pi/3)$. This gives $(V_+-V_-)[\\cos(\\omega t - 2\\pi/3) - \\cos(\\omega t + 2\\pi/3)] = 0$, leading to $\\sin(\\omega t)=0$. The crossover points at $\\omega t = k\\pi$ are unshifted.\n- **$v_c = v_a$ crossover**: In the balanced case, this is at $\\omega t = 5\\pi/3$. With unbalance, an analogous calculation leads to $\\tan(\\omega t) = -\\sqrt{3} \\frac{1+r}{1-r}$. The angle shifts from $5\\pi/3$ to $5\\pi/3-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}r$. This is an advance.\n\nThe sequence of angular durations for the six conduction intervals (normally all $\\pi/3$ or $60^\\circ$) becomes uneven.\n\n**3. Impact on DC Ripple**\nThe DC output voltage is composed of segments of the line-to-line voltages. We have shown that the durations of these segments (conduction intervals) are no longer uniform. Furthermore, the amplitudes of the line-to-line voltage waveforms also change. For example, the peak of $v_{bc}$ is scaled by $(1-r)$, while the peaks of $v_{ab}$ and $v_{ca}$ are scaled by approximately $(1+r/2)$. This modulation of pulse amplitude and width creates a pattern of non-uniformity that repeats every half-cycle of the line frequency (period $\\pi/\\omega$). A periodic distortion with period $T/2$ on a signal of period $T/6$ will introduce even harmonics of the fundamental line frequency. Therefore, the unbalanced source will introduce a second harmonic ($2\\omega$) component into the DC output voltage ripple, which is not present in the balanced case (where ripple frequencies are $6k\\omega$).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The line-to-line maxima remain at angles separated by exactly $60^\\circ$ with no timing shift; all six conduction intervals remain exactly $60^\\circ$, and the direct-current ripple spectrum is unchanged.**\n**Incorrect.** Our derivation shows that the maxima timings are shifted, the conduction intervals are no longer $60^\\circ$, and the ripple spectrum is altered.\n\n**B. For $v_{ab}$, the time of its maxima is delayed by approximately $\\Delta t \\approx \\dfrac{3}{2\\sqrt{3}\\,\\omega}\\,r$ for small $r$, while $v_{bc}$ and $v_{ca}$ retain their original maxima timings; the diode conduction intervals deviate slightly from $60^\\circ$ in an alternating advance/delay pattern over a line cycle, and an additional second-harmonic ($2\\omega$) component appears in the direct-current ripple due to the uneven pulse spacing and amplitudes.**\n**Partially Correct/Best Fit.** This option is the most accurate description, despite a minor flaw.\n- The delay for $v_{ab}$ is correctly stated: $\\Delta t = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2\\omega}r = \\frac{3}{2\\sqrt{3}\\omega}r$.\n- The statement that $v_{bc}$ timing is retained is correct.\n- The statement that $v_{ca}$ timing is retained is incorrect (it is advanced). However, this is one detail among several correct statements.\n- The statement that conduction intervals deviate from $60^\\circ$ is correct.\n- The statement that a second-harmonic ($2\\omega$) ripple appears due to uneven pulses is correct and a key consequence of the unbalance.\nGiven that all other options contain fundamental errors, this is the intended correct answer.\n\n**C. The negative-sequence component advances all six commutations by the same angle so that each conduction interval remains $60^\\circ$; the only effect is an increase in the $6\\omega$ ripple amplitude without introducing lower-order ripple components.**\n**Incorrect.** Commutations are a mix of delayed, advanced, and unshifted. Conduction intervals do not remain $60^\\circ$. Lower-order ($2\\omega$) ripple is introduced.\n\n**D. The maxima of $v_{ab}$ are shifted earlier in time by $\\Delta t \\approx \\dfrac{r}{\\omega}$ independent of sequence sign; each conduction interval shrinks to less than $60^\\circ$ by the same constant offset, and the total commutation frequency increases.**\n**Incorrect.** The maximum of $v_{ab}$ is delayed, not advanced. The shift magnitude is incorrect. The conduction intervals do not all shrink. The commutation frequency ($6$ per cycle) does not change.\n\n**E. The negative-sequence produces a beat term at $2\\omega$ directly in $v_{ab}(t)$, causing pairs of diodes to cease conduction intermittently within a half-cycle even with continuous direct-current load, fundamentally altering the six-pulse pattern.**\n**Incorrect.** The sum of two sinusoids of the same frequency, $\\omega$, results in a single sinusoid at frequency $\\omega$, not a beat term. The assumption of a large DC inductance guarantees continuous conduction, so no diodes cease conduction intermittently.",
