            "problem": "A single-phase fully-controlled bridge rectifier feeds a highly inductive direct current load, resulting in continuous direct current. The alternating current source voltage is $v_s(t) = V_m \\sin(\\omega t)$, where $V_m$ and $\\omega$ are strictly positive constants. The bridge is ideal: semiconductor devices are lossless, switching is instantaneous, and commutation overlap due to source inductance is negligible. The direct current is modeled as a constant $I_d  0$ over the entire operating cycle. The firing angle is specified as $\\alpha \\in (0, \\pi)$, in radians, measured from the zero crossing of $v_s(t)$ at which $v_s(t)$ increases.\n\nUnder these conditions, the alternating current source current $i_s(t)$ is a periodic function of angular position $\\theta = \\omega t$ with period $2\\pi$, and is piecewise constant with magnitude $I_d$ and alternating sign. Specifically, the positive device pair conducts for an interval of $\\pi$ radians starting at $\\theta = \\alpha$, yielding $i_s(\\theta) = +I_d$ for $\\theta \\in (\\alpha, \\alpha+\\pi)$, and the negative device pair conducts for the next $\\pi$ radians, yielding $i_s(\\theta) = -I_d$ for $\\theta \\in (\\alpha+\\pi, \\alpha+2\\pi)$, repeating every $2\\pi$.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definitions of the Fourier series for a $2\\pi$-periodic function and the above conduction model, derive the complete Fourier series of the alternating current source current $i_s(\\theta)$ in the canonical cosine–sine form\n$$\ni_s(\\theta) = \\frac{a_0}{2} + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left[a_n \\cos(n\\theta) + b_n \\sin(n\\theta)\\right],\n$$\nwhere each coefficient must be expressed explicitly as an integral over one period and then evaluated in closed form in terms of $I_d$ and $\\alpha$.\n\nThen, define $I_1$ as the root-mean-square (RMS) magnitude of the fundamental (first harmonic) component of $i_s(\\theta)$ at angular frequency $\\omega$.

According to Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL), the voltage supplied to the load, $v_o(t)$, must equal the sum of the voltage drops across the resistor $R$ and the inductor $L$. For a fully-controlled bridge rectifier, during the conduction interval of a pair of Silicon Controlled Rectifiers (SCRs), the load is connected to the source. This interval begins at the firing angle $\\alpha$ and ends at the extinction angle $\\beta$. Thus, for the duration of conduction, the voltage across the load is the source voltage, $v_o(t) = v_s(t) = V_m \\sin(\\omega t)$. The KVL equation is:\n$$L \\frac{d i_o(t)}{dt} + R i_o(t) = V_m \\sin(\\omega t)$$\nwhere $i_o(t)$ is the load current. This is a first-order linear non-homogeneous ordinary differential equation.\n\nTo facilitate the analysis, we change the independent variable from time $t$ to angle $\\theta = \\omega t$.

The firing occurs at $\\theta = \\alpha$. In a fully-controlled bridge, the next pair of SCRs is fired at $\\theta = \\alpha + \\pi$. Therefore, the boundary condition implies that the current starts at zero at $\\theta = \\alpha$ and goes back to zero at $\\theta = \\alpha + \\pi$.\nThe two boundary conditions for $i_o(\\theta)$ at $L=L_{crit}$ are:\n1. $i_o(\\alpha) = 0$\n2. $i_o(\\alpha + \\pi) = 0$\n\nApplying the first boundary condition, $i_o(\\alpha) = 0$:\n$$0 = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{R\\alpha}{\\omega L_{crit}}\\right) + \\frac{V_m}{\\sqrt{R^2 + (\\omega L_{crit})^2}} \\sin(\\alpha - \\phi_{crit})$$\nwhere $\\phi_{crit} = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\omega L_{crit}}{R}\\right)$.\nSolving for the constant $A$:\n$$A = -\\frac{V_m}{\\sqrt{R^2 + (\\omega L_{crit})^2}} \\sin(\\alpha - \\phi_{crit}) \\exp\\left(\\frac{R\\alpha}{\\omega L_{crit}}\\right)$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $A$ back into the general solution for $i_o(\\theta)$:\n$$i_o(\\theta) = \\left[-\\frac{V_m}{|Z_{crit}|} \\sin(\\alpha - \\phi_{crit}) \\exp\\left(\\frac{R\\alpha}{\\omega L_{crit}}\\right)\\right] \\exp\\left(-\\frac{R\\theta}{\\omega L_{crit}}\\right) + \\frac{V_m}{|Z_{crit}|} \\sin(\\theta - \\phi_{crit})$$\n$$i_o(\\theta) = \\frac{V_m}{|Z_{crit}|} \\left[ \\sin(\\theta - \\phi_{crit}) - \\sin(\\alpha - \\phi_{crit}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{R(\\theta - \\alpha)}{\\omega L_{crit}}\\right) \\right]$$\nwhere $|Z_{crit}| = \\sqrt{R^2 + (\\omega L_{crit})^2}$.\n\nNow, we apply the second boundary condition, $i_o(\\alpha + \\pi) = 0$:\n$$0 = \\frac{V_m}{|Z_{crit}|} \\left[ \\sin(\\alpha + \\pi - \\phi_{crit}) - \\sin(\\alpha - \\phi_{crit}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{R(\\alpha + \\pi - \\alpha)}{\\omega L_{crit}}\\right) \\right]$$\nSince $V_m  0$ and $|Z_{crit}|0$, the term in the brackets must be zero:\n$$\\sin(\\alpha + \\pi - \\phi_{crit}) = \\sin(\\alpha - \\phi_{crit}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi R}{\\omega L_{crit}}\\right)$$\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\sin(x + \\pi) = -\\sin(x)$, we have $\\sin(\\alpha + \\pi - \\phi_{crit}) = -\\sin(\\alpha - \\phi_{crit})$. The equation becomes:\n$$-\\sin(\\alpha - \\phi_{crit}) = \\sin(\\alpha - \\phi_{crit}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi R}{\\omega L_{crit}}\\right)$$\nRearranging the terms:\n$$\\sin(\\alpha - \\phi_{crit}) \\left[ 1 + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi R}{\\omega L_{crit}}\\right) \\right] = 0$$\nThe term in the square brackets, $\\left[ 1 + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi R}{\\omega L_{crit}}\\right) \\right]$, is strictly positive because $R0$, $\\omega0$, $L_{crit}0$, which makes the exponential term positive. Therefore, for the product to be zero, the other factor must be zero:\n$$\\sin(\\alpha - \\phi_{crit}) = 0$$\nThis implies that $\\alpha - \\phi_{crit} = n\\pi$ for some integer $n$.\nFrom the problem statement, the firing angle $\\alpha$ is in the range $0  \\alpha  \\pi/2$. The impedance angle $\\phi_{crit} = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\omega L_{crit}}{R}\\right)$ is also in the range $0  \\phi_{crit}  \\pi/2$ because $R0$, $\\omega0$, and $L_{crit}0$.\nThe difference $\\alpha - \\phi_{crit}$ must therefore be in the range $-\\pi/2  \\alpha - \\phi_{crit}  \\pi/2$. The only integer multiple of $\\pi$ in this interval is $0$.\nThus, we must have:\n$$\\alpha - \\phi_{crit} = 0 \\implies \\alpha = \\phi_{crit}$$\n\nUsing the definition of the impedance angle $\\phi_{crit}$:\n$$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\omega L_{crit}}{R}\\right)$$\nTo solve for $L_{crit}$, we take the tangent of both sides:\n$$\\tan\\alpha = \\frac{\\omega L_{crit}}{R}$$\nFinally, isolating $L_{crit}$ gives the desired expression:\n$$L_{crit} = \\frac{R}{\\omega} \\tan\\alpha$$\nThis expression represents the minimum inductance required to ensure the load current does not become zero before the next pair of SCRs is fired, for the given firing angle $\\alpha$.",
