All semiconductor devices are ideal with zero forward voltage drop and instantaneous switching; source inductance and commutation overlap are negligible. The firing angle of the converter is $\\alpha$, with $0 \\leq \\alpha \\leq \\pi$, measured in radians.\n\nBecause the load is purely resistive, the output current and voltage are discontinuous: in each half cycle, the conducting thyristor pair ceases conduction when the source voltage crosses zero. Thus, in the normalized angle variable $\\theta = \\omega t$, the output voltage $v_{o}(\\theta)$ is applied only over the intervals $\\theta \\in [\\alpha, \\pi]$ in the positive half-cycle and $\\theta \\in [\\pi+\\alpha, 2\\pi]$ in the negative half-cycle.

However, the waveform of the full-wave rectified voltage repeats every half-cycle of the source voltage. The shape of the voltage pulse from $\\theta = \\alpha$ to $\\theta = \\pi$ is identical to the shape of the voltage pulse from $\\theta = \\pi + \\alpha$ to $\\theta = 2\\pi$. Thus, the fundamental period of the output voltage $v_{o}(\\theta)$ is $T_{o} = \\pi$ radians. We can therefore calculate the average value by integrating over this shorter period, $\\pi$.\n\nThe average DC output voltage, $V_{dc}$, is:\n$$V_{dc} = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} v_{o}(\\theta) d\\theta$$\nAccording to the problem statement, in the interval $[0, \\pi]$, the output voltage $v_{o}(\\theta)$ is zero for $\\theta \\in [0, \\alpha)$ and is equal to $v_{s}(\\theta) = V_{m} \\sin(\\theta)$ for $\\theta \\in [\\alpha, \\pi]$.

We evaluate this definite integral as follows:\n$$V_{dc} = \\frac{V_{m}}{\\pi} [-\\cos(\\theta)]_{\\alpha}^{\\pi}$$\nSubstituting the limits of integration:\n$$V_{dc} = \\frac{V_{m}}{\\pi} (-\\cos(\\pi) - (-\\cos(\\alpha)))$$\nWe know that $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$. Substituting this value yields:\n$$V_{dc} = \\frac{V_{m}}{\\pi} (-(-1) + \\cos(\\alpha))$$\n$$V_{dc} = \\frac{V_{m}}{\\pi} (1 + \\cos(\\alpha))$$\nThis expression gives the average DC output voltage as a function of the peak input voltage $V_{m}$ and the firing angle $\\alpha$.",

It represents a standard, analyzable problem in the study of controlled rectifiers.\n\nThe ripple factor, $r_v$, for a periodic output voltage waveform $v_d(t)$ is defined as the ratio of the root-mean-square (RMS) value of the AC (ripple) component to the average (DC) value of the waveform. The total waveform can be decomposed as $v_d(t) = V_{d, \\text{avg}} + v_r(t)$, where $V_{d, \\text{avg}}$ is the average value and $v_r(t)$ is the AC ripple component. The RMS value of the total waveform, $V_{d, \\text{rms}}$, is related to the average value and the RMS value of the ripple, $V_{r, \\text{rms}}$, by the equation $V_{d, \\text{rms}}^{2} = V_{d, \\text{avg}}^{2} + V_{r, \\text{rms}}^{2}$.

In a single-phase fully-controlled bridge rectifier operating in continuous conduction mode (guaranteed by the large inductance $L_d$), the output voltage $v_d(t)$ is composed of segments of the input voltage. The SCRs are triggered in pairs. One pair is triggered at $\\omega t = \\alpha$, and the other pair is triggered at $\\omega t = \\pi + \\alpha$. The constant load current $I_d$ forces each pair to conduct for an interval of $\\pi$ radians.\nThe output voltage $v_d(t)$ is given by:\n- $v_d(t) = v_s(t) = V_m \\sin(\\omega t)$ for the interval where the first pair conducts, from $\\omega t = \\alpha$ to $\\omega t = \\pi + \\alpha$.\n- $v_d(t) = -v_s(t) = -V_m \\sin(\\omega t)$ for the interval where the second pair conducts, from $\\omega t = \\pi + \\alpha$ to $\\omega t = 2\\pi + \\alpha$.\n\nThe output voltage waveform $v_d(t)$ is periodic with a fundamental angular frequency of $2\\omega$, which corresponds to a period of $\\pi$ radians in the $\\omega t$ domain.\n\nFirst, we calculate the average output voltage, $V_{d, \\text{avg}}$.
