            "solution": "The problem asks for the average total conduction power loss of the six thyristors in a three-phase fully-controlled bridge rectifier. We are instructed to use the definitions of instantaneous power and averaging over a period.\n\nThe average power, $P_{avg}$, dissipated in a system over one period $T$ is defined as the time integral of the instantaneous power, $p(t)$, over that period, divided by the period itself:\n$$P_{avg} = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} p(t) dt$$\n\nIn this problem, we need to find the total average conduction power loss, $P_{loss,total}$, for all six thyristors combined. The total instantaneous power loss, $p_{loss,total}(t)$, is the sum of the instantaneous power losses in each of the six devices.\n\nThe problem states that at any instant, exactly two thyristors are conducting. The remaining four thyristors are in the off-state and are assumed to have zero conduction loss. Therefore, the total instantaneous power loss is the sum of the losses in the two conducting devices.\n$$p_{loss,total}(t) = p_{T,on,1}(t) + p_{T,on,2}(t)$$\nwhere $p_{T,on,1}(t)$ and $p_{T,on,2}(t)$ are the instantaneous power losses of the two conducting thyristors.\n\nThe instantaneous power loss in a single conducting thyristor is given by the product of the voltage across it, $v_T(t)$, and the current through it, $i_T(t)$.\n$$p_T(t) = v_T(t)i_T(t)$$\n\nThe problem specifies that the rectifier feeds a highly inductive load, resulting in a constant DC output current $I_d = 100\\ \\text{A}$. In a three-phase bridge rectifier operating in continuous conduction, the current flows from the AC source, through one thyristor in the positive group, through the load, and back to the source through one thyristor in the negative group. Thus, the current passing through each of the two conducting devices is equal to the constant load current, $I_d$.\n$$i_T(t) = I_d = 100\\ \\text{A}$$\n\nThe on-state voltage drop across a conducting thyristor is modeled by the piecewise-linear relation $v_{T}(i) = V_{T} + r_{T}i$. Substituting the constant current $I_d$ for $i$, we find the voltage drop across each conducting thyristor is also constant:\n$$v_T = V_T + r_T I_d$$\nThe given parameters are $V_T = 1.5\\ \\text{V}$ and $r_T = 10\\ \\text{m}\\Omega = 0.01\\ \\Omega$.\n\nThe instantaneous power loss in a single conducting thyristor is therefore constant during its conduction interval:\n$$p_{T,on} = v_T \\cdot I_d = (V_T + r_T I_d) I_d = V_T I_d + r_T I_d^2$$\n\nSince exactly two identical thyristors are conducting at any given time and each carries the same current $I_d$, the total instantaneous power loss for the entire rectifier is:\n$$p_{loss,total}(t) = p_{T,on} + p_{T,on} = 2(V_T I_d + r_T I_d^2)$$\nCrucially, because $V_T$, $r_T$, and $I_d$ are all constants, the total instantaneous power loss $p_{loss,total}(t)$ is a constant value over the entire electrical cycle. Let's denote this constant power as $P_{const}$.\n$$P_{const} = 2(V_T I_d + r_T I_d^2)$$\n\nNow, we can find the average total power loss by integrating this constant instantaneous power over one period $T$:\n$$P_{loss,total} = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} P_{const} dt = \\frac{P_{const}}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} dt = \\frac{P_{const}}{T} [t]_0^T = \\frac{P_{const} \\cdot T}{T} = P_{const}$$\nThe average power loss is simply equal to the constant instantaneous power loss.\n$$P_{loss,total} = 2(V_T I_d + r_T I_d^2)$$\n\nWe substitute the given numerical values:\n$$I_d = 100\\ \\text{A}$$\n$$V_T = 1.5\\ \\text{V}$$\n$$r_T = 0.01\\ \\Omega$$\n\nThe total average power loss is:\n$$P_{loss,total} = 2 \\left( (1.5\\ \\text{V})(100\\ \\text{A}) + (0.01\\ \\Omega)(100\\ \\text{A})^2 \\right)$$\n$$P_{loss,total} = 2 \\left( 150\\ \\text{W} + (0.01\\ \\Omega)(10000\\ \\text{A}^2) \\right)$$\n$$P_{loss,total} = 2 \\left( 150\\ \\text{W} + 100\\ \\text{W} \\right)$$\n$$P_{loss,total} = 2 (250\\ \\text{W})$$\n$$P_{loss,total} = 500\\ \\text{W}$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.

The device models are standard piecewise linear approximations. The assumption of continuous current is a common and valid simplification for highly inductive loads. The problem is well-posed, with sufficient information and clear tasks. It is objectively stated. The given \"Fundamental Facts\" are correct for a six-pulse bridge operating in continuous conduction mode and form a valid basis for the derivation. The problem is internally consistent and does not violate any physical or mathematical principles. The presence of the firing angle $\\alpha$ is noted; however, for the calculation of conduction losses in continuous conduction mode, its specific value is not necessary, as the conduction *duration* is determined by the bridge topology and symmetry, not the firing delay.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution is warranted.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\n**Task 1: Conduction Interval Derivation**\n\nThe problem states that the converter is a balanced, three-phase, six-pulse bridge. A full electrical cycle corresponds to an angle of $2\\pi$ radians ($360^{\\circ}$). The system comprises a positive group of $3$ SCRs and a negative group of $3$ diodes.\n\nA key premise provided is that in steady state, each individual device conducts for an equal interval. This is due to the symmetry of the balanced three-phase system. The total conduction duty for the positive side of the DC link must be shared equally among the $3$ SCRs. Therefore, over one full cycle of $2\\pi$ radians, each of the $3$ SCRs must conduct for one-third of the cycle.\n\nThe conduction interval for a single SCR, $\\theta_{\\mathrm{cond,SCR}}$, is:\n$$ \\theta_{\\mathrm{cond,SCR}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\text{ radians} $$\nThis corresponds to $120^{\\circ}$.\n\nSimilarly, the conduction duty for the negative side of the DC link is shared equally among the $3$ diodes. Thus, the conduction interval for a single diode, $\\theta_{\\mathrm{cond,D}}$, is also one-third of a full cycle:\n$$ \\theta_{\\mathrm{cond,D}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\text{ radians} $$\n\nThis result is consistent with the second given fact that the conducting device pair changes every $60^{\\circ}$ ($\\pi/3$ radians). There are $6$ such intervals in a full $360^{\\circ}$ cycle. Each device conducts for two consecutive intervals, resulting in a total conduction angle of $2 \\times 60^{\\circ} = 120^{\\circ}$.\n\n**Task 2: Conduction Loss Expressions**\n\nThe DC load current, $I_{\\mathrm{d}}$, is constant. When a semiconductor device (SCR or diode) is conducting, the current through it is $I_{\\mathrm{d}}$.\n\nThe instantaneous power dissipated in a device during its conduction phase is given by the product of the on-state voltage drop and the current.\nFor an SCR, the on-state voltage is $v_{\\mathrm{SCR}} = V_{T0} + r_{T} I_{\\mathrm{d}}$. The instantaneous conduction power loss is:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{cond,SCR}} = v_{\\mathrm{SCR}} \\cdot I_{\\mathrm{d}} = (V_{T0} + r_{T} I_{\\mathrm{d}}) I_{\\mathrm{d}} = V_{T0} I_{\\mathrm{d}} + r_{T} I_{\\mathrm{d}}^{2} $$\nFor a diode, the on-state voltage is $v_{\\mathrm{D}} = V_{D0} + r_{D} I_{\\mathrm{d}}$. The instantaneous conduction power loss is:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{cond,D}} = v_{\\mathrm{D}} \\cdot I_{\\mathrm{d}} = (V_{D0} + r_{D} I_{\\mathrm{d}}) I_{\\mathrm{d}} = V_{D0} I_{\\mathrm{d}} + r_{D} I_{\\mathrm{d}}^{2} $$\nThe average power loss in a single device over a full AC cycle is the instantaneous power loss during conduction multiplied by the device's duty cycle, $D$. The duty cycle is the fraction of the total period for which the device conducts.\nThe duty cycle for both SCRs and diodes is:\n$$ D = \\frac{\\text{Conduction Angle}}{\\text{Full Cycle Angle}} = \\frac{2\\pi/3}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\nThe average conduction loss per individual SCR is:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{avg,SCR}} = D \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{cond,SCR}} = \\frac{1}{3} (V_{T0} I_{\\mathrm{d}} + r_{T} I_{\\mathrm{d}}^{2}) $$\nThe average conduction loss per individual diode is:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{avg,D}} = D \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{cond,D}} = \\frac{1}{3} (V_{D0} I_{\\mathrm{d}} + r_{D} I_{\\mathrm{d}}^{2}) $$\nThe total conduction loss in the SCR bank, which contains $3$ SCRs, is:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{loss,SCR\\_bank}} = 3 \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{avg,SCR}} = 3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} (V_{T0} I_{\\mathrm{d}} + r_{T} I_{\\mathrm{d}}^{2}) = V_{T0} I_{\\mathrm{d}} + r_{T} I_{\\mathrm{d}}^{2} $$\nThe total conduction loss in the diode bank, which contains $3$ diodes, is:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{loss,D\\_bank}} = 3 \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{avg,D}} = 3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} (V_{D0} I_{\\mathrm{d}} + r_{D} I_{\\mathrm{d}}^{2}) = V_{D0} I_{\\mathrm{d}} + r_{D} I_{\\mathrm{d}}^{2} $$\nNote that the firing angle $\\alpha$ determines the phase of the output voltage waveform and its average value, but does not affect the conduction duration or current magnitude in continuous conduction mode, and thus does not enter into the conduction loss calculation.\n\n**Task 3: Numerical Evaluation**\n\nGiven values are $I_{\\mathrm{d}} = 150\\,\\mathrm{A}$, $V_{T0} = 1.8\\,\\mathrm{V}$, $r_{T} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\Omega$, $V_{D0} = 1.1\\,\\mathrm{V}$, and $r_{D} = 0.8 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\Omega$.

The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, providing all necessary information to determine a unique solution for the junction temperature. No scientific laws are violated, and the setup is physically plausible.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A detailed solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Junction Temperature Expression\n\nThe steady-state junction temperature $T_{\\mathrm{j}}$ of a semiconductor device is determined by the ambient temperature $T_{\\mathrm{a}}$, the average power dissipated by the device $P_{\\mathrm{D}}$, and the thermal resistance path from the device junction to the ambient.\n\nThe thermal model can be represented by an equivalent electrical circuit where temperature difference is analogous to voltage, power (heat flow) is analogous to current, and thermal resistance is analogous to electrical resistance. For a single SCR, the heat flows from the junction to the case, then from the case to the shared heat sink, and finally from the heat sink to the ambient.\n\nThe temperature rise from junction to case is $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{jc}} = P_{\\mathrm{D}} R_{\\theta \\mathrm{jc}}$.\nThe temperature rise from case to sink is $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{cs}} = P_{\\mathrm{D}} R_{\\theta \\mathrm{cs}}$.\n\nAll $6$ SCRs dissipate power into the common heat sink.

Turn-off losses are stated to be negligible.\n$$P_{\\mathrm{D}} = P_{\\mathrm{cond}} + P_{\\mathrm{sw}}$$\nThe switching losses are composed of turn-on and turn-off losses.

The duty cycle of conduction for one SCR is $D = \\frac{120}{360} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nDuring conduction, the current is the constant DC load current, $I_{\\mathrm{dc}}$. The on-state voltage drop across the SCR is $v_{T} = V_{T0} + r_{T} I_{\\mathrm{dc}}$.\nThe instantaneous power dissipated during conduction is $p(t) = v_{T} i(t) = (V_{T0} + r_{T} I_{\\mathrm{dc}}) I_{\\mathrm{dc}}$.\nThe average conduction power loss is this instantaneous power multiplied by the duty cycle:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{cond}} = D \\times (V_{T0} + r_{T} I_{\\mathrm{dc}}) I_{\\mathrm{dc}} = \\frac{1}{3} I_{\\mathrm{dc}} (V_{T0} + r_{T} I_{\\mathrm{dc}})$$\n\n**Switching Loss ($P_{\\mathrm{on}}$):**\nEach SCR in a three-phase bridge rectifier turns on once per cycle of the AC supply. The frequency of turn-on events for a single SCR is equal to the supply frequency, $f$. The turn-on energy is given as $E_{\\mathrm{on}}$ per event. The average power loss due to turn-on is the energy per event multiplied by the frequency of events:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{on}} = E_{\\mathrm{on}} f$$\n\n**Total Power Dissipation ($P_{\\mathrm{D}}$):**\nThe total average power dissipated by one SCR is:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{D}} = P_{\\mathrm{cond}} + P_{\\mathrm{on}} = \\frac{1}{3} I_{\\mathrm{dc}} (V_{T0} + r_{T} I_{\\mathrm{dc}}) + E_{\\mathrm{on}} f$$\n\n**Final Symbolic Expression for $T_{\\mathrm{j}}$:**\nSubstituting the expression for $P_{\\mathrm{D}}$ into the equation for $T_{\\mathrm{j}}$:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{j}} = T_{\\mathrm{a}} + \\left[ \\frac{1}{3} I_{\\mathrm{dc}}(V_{T0} + r_{T} I_{\\mathrm{dc}}) + E_{\\mathrm{on}} f \\right] (R_{\\theta \\mathrm{jc}} + R_{\\theta \\mathrm{cs}} + 6 R_{\\theta \\mathrm{sa}})$$\n\n### Numerical Calculation\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into the derived expression. We can work with temperatures in degrees Celsius ($^{\\circ}$C) since thermal resistance is given in K/W, and a temperature difference of $1$ K is equivalent to a temperature difference of $1$ $^{\\circ}$C.\n\n**$1$. Calculate the power dissipation per SCR ($P_{\\mathrm{D}}$):**\n- Conduction Loss ($P_{\\mathrm{cond}}$):\n$$P_{\\mathrm{cond}} = \\frac{1}{3} (180 \\text{ A}) \\left( 1.2 \\text{ V} + (1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ }\\Omega)(180 \\text{ A}) \\right)$$\n$$P_{\\mathrm{cond}} = 60 \\left( 1.2 + 0.18 \\right) \\text{ W} = 60(1.38) \\text{ W} = 82.8 \\text{ W}$$\n- Switching Loss ($P_{\\mathrm{on}}$):\n$$P_{\\mathrm{on}} = (2.5 \\text{ J})(50 \\text{ Hz}) = 125 \\text{ W}$$\n- Total Power Loss ($P_{\\mathrm{D}}$):\n$$P_{\\mathrm{D}} = P_{\\mathrm{cond}} + P_{\\mathrm{on}} = 82.8 \\text{ W} + 125 \\text{ W} = 207.8 \\text{ W}$$\n\n**$2$. Calculate the effective thermal resistance term for a single SCR:**\nThe term multiplying $P_{\\mathrm{D}}$ is the effective thermal resistance from junction to ambient for one device considering the shared heat sink.\n$$R_{\\theta, \\mathrm{eff}} = R_{\\theta \\mathrm{jc}} + R_{\\theta \\mathrm{cs}} + 6 R_{\\theta \\mathrm{sa}}$$\n$$R_{\\theta, \\mathrm{eff}} = 0.10 \\text{ K/W} + 0.020 \\text{ K/W} + 6(0.040 \\text{ K/W})$$\n$$R_{\\theta, \\mathrm{eff}} = 0.120 \\text{ K/W} + 0.240 \\text{ K/W} = 0.360 \\text{ K/W}$$\n\n**$3$. Calculate the junction temperature ($T_{\\mathrm{j}}$):**\n$$T_{\\mathrm{j}} = T_{\\mathrm{a}} + P_{\\mathrm{D}} R_{\\theta, \\mathrm{eff}}$$\n$$T_{\\mathrm{j}} = 35\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C} + (207.8 \\text{ W})(0.360 \\text{ K/W})$$\n$$T_{\\mathrm{j}} = 35\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C} + 74.808\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$$\n$$T_{\\mathrm{j}} = 109.808\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final temperature to four significant figures.\n$$T_{\\mathrm{j}} \\approx 109.8\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$$",
