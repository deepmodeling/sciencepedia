            "problem": "Consider a direct current (DC) link converter implementing Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM) with a triangular carrier of peak amplitude $V_{c}$ and angular frequency $\\omega_{c}$ and a sinusoidal modulating signal of angular frequency $\\omega_{1}$ and peak amplitude $V_{m}$. Define the modulation index as $m_{a} = V_{m}/V_{c}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of power electronics, specifically Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM), and is well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It provides a clear directive for deriving the fundamental voltage amplitudes for two standard inverter configurations using a specified first-principles approach. Therefore, a solution can be derived.\n\nThe core principle for this derivation is the method of local averaging. Given the condition that the carrier frequency is much higher than the modulating frequency ($\\omega_{c} \\gg \\omega_{1}$), the modulating signal $v_{m}(t)$ can be treated as approximately constant over a single carrier period, $T_{c} = 2\\pi/\\omega_{c}$. The low-frequency component of the high-frequency switched PWM voltage waveform is, therefore, equal to its average value computed over one carrier period. This local average, denoted $\\langle v(t) \\rangle_{T_{c}}$, will track the modulating signal.\n\nAn additional assumption is required regarding the carrier signal. The problem defines a triangular carrier of peak amplitude $V_{c}$. We assume this is a symmetric triangular wave, centered about zero volts, oscillating linearly between $-V_{c}$ and $+V_{c}$. This is the standard convention that aligns with the definition of the modulation index $m_{a} = V_{m}/V_{c}$ for linear modulation without requiring a DC offset in the modulating signal.\n\nLet us determine the relationship between the modulating signal $v_{m}(t)$ and the duty cycle $d(t)$ of the upper switch in a converter leg. The upper switch is ON, and the pole voltage is high, when the modulating signal $v_{m}(t)$ is greater than the carrier signal $v_{c}(t)$. Due to the linear nature of the symmetric triangular carrier, the proportion of the period for which $v_{m}(t) > v_{c}(t)$ is linearly related to the value of $v_{m}(t)$.\nWhen $v_{m}(t) = V_{c}$, the upper switch is on for the entire period, so $d(t) = 1$.\nWhen $v_{m}(t) = -V_{c}$, the upper switch is off for the entire period, so $d(t) = 0$.\nWhen $v_{m}(t) = 0$, the duty cycle is $d(t) = 0.5$.\nThis linear relationship is given by:\n$$d(t) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{v_{m}(t)}{2V_{c}}$$\n\nWith this foundation, we can proceed to derive the output voltage amplitudes for both specified cases.\n\n**1. Half-Bridge with Bipolar SPWM**\n\nIn this configuration, a single converter leg produces a pole voltage $v_{p}(t)$ that switches between two levels, $+V_{dc}/2$ and $-V_{dc}/2$. The modulating signal is $v_{m}(t) = V_{m}\\sin(\\omega_{1} t)$.\n\nThe instantaneous pole voltage is given by:\n$$v_{p}(t) = \n\\begin{cases} \n+V_{dc}/2  \\text{if } v_{m}(t) > v_{c}(t) \\\\\n-V_{dc}/2  \\text{if } v_{m}(t)  v_{c}(t) \n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThe local average of this pole voltage, $\\langle v_{p}(t) \\rangle_{T_{c}}$, is the sum of the voltage levels weighted by their respective duty cycles. The duty cycle for the $+V_{dc}/2$ state is $d(t)$, and for the $-V_{dc}/2$ state, it is $(1 - d(t))$.\n$$\\langle v_{p}(t) \\rangle_{T_{c}} = d(t) \\left( \\frac{+V_{dc}}{2} \\right) + (1 - d(t)) \\left( \\frac{-V_{dc}}{2} \\right)$$\n$$\\langle v_{p}(t) \\rangle_{T_{c}} = d(t) V_{dc} - \\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for the duty cycle $d(t)$:\n$$\\langle v_{p}(t) \\rangle_{T_{c}} = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{v_{m}(t)}{2V_{c}} \\right) V_{dc} - \\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$$\n$$\\langle v_{p}(t) \\rangle_{T_{c}} = \\frac{V_{dc}}{2} + \\frac{V_{dc}}{2V_{c}} v_{m}(t) - \\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$$\n$$\\langle v_{p}(t) \\rangle_{T_{c}} = \\frac{V_{dc}}{2V_{c}} v_{m}(t)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the sinusoidal modulating signal $v_{m}(t) = V_{m}\\sin(\\omega_{1} t)$ and the definition of the modulation index $m_{a} = V_{m}/V_{c}$.\n$$\\langle v_{p}(t) \\rangle_{T_{c}} = \\frac{V_{dc}}{2V_{c}} (V_{m}\\sin(\\omega_{1} t)) = \\frac{V_{dc}}{2} \\left( \\frac{V_{m}}{V_{c}} \\right) \\sin(\\omega_{1} t)$$\n$$\\langle v_{p}(t) \\rangle_{T_{c}} = \\frac{1}{2} m_{a} V_{dc} \\sin(\\omega_{1} t)$$\n\nThis locally averaged voltage represents the fundamental component of the pole voltage $v_{p}(t)$. The amplitude of this fundamental component, $\\hat{V}_{1}^{\\mathrm{bip}}$, is therefore:\n$$\\hat{V}_{1}^{\\mathrm{bip}} = \\frac{1}{2} m_{a} V_{dc}$$\n\n**2. Single-Phase Full-Bridge with Unipolar SPWM**\n\nIn this configuration, two converter legs (leg A and leg B) are used. The desired line-to-line output voltage is $v_{o}(t) = v_{aN}(t) - v_{bN}(t)$. Leg A is controlled by the modulating signal $v_{m,a}(t) = V_{m}\\sin(\\omega_{1} t)$, and leg B is controlled by $v_{m,b}(t) = -V_{m}\\sin(\\omega_{1} t)$. Both modulating signals are compared against the same triangular carrier $v_{c}(t)$. Each pole voltage, $v_{aN}(t)$ and $v_{bN}(t)$, switches between $+V_{dc}/2$ and $-V_{dc}/2$.\n\nThe low-frequency component of the output voltage is the difference between the local averages of the two pole voltages:\n$$\\langle v_{o}(t) \\rangle_{T_{c}} = \\langle v_{aN}(t) \\rangle_{T_{c}} - \\langle v_{bN}(t) \\rangle_{T_{c}}$$\n\nWe can apply the result derived for the half-bridge to each leg individually.\nFor leg A, with modulating signal $v_{m,a}(t)$:\n$$\\langle v_{aN}(t) \\rangle_{T_{c}} = \\frac{V_{dc}}{2V_{c}} v_{m,a}(t) = \\frac{V_{dc}}{2V_{c}} V_{m}\\sin(\\omega_{1} t)$$\n\nFor leg B, with modulating signal $v_{m,b}(t)$:\n$$\\langle v_{bN}(t) \\rangle_{T_{c}} = \\frac{V_{dc}}{2V_{c}} v_{m,b}(t) = \\frac{V_{dc}}{2V_{c}} (-V_{m}\\sin(\\omega_{1} t)) = -\\frac{V_{dc}}{2V_{c}} V_{m}\\sin(\\omega_{1} t)$$\n\nNow, we compute the difference to find the average output voltage:\n$$\\langle v_{o}(t) \\rangle_{T_{c}} = \\left( \\frac{V_{dc}}{2V_{c}} V_{m}\\sin(\\omega_{1} t) \\right) - \\left( -\\frac{V_{dc}}{2V_{c}} V_{m}\\sin(\\omega_{1} t) \\right)$$\n$$\\langle v_{o}(t) \\rangle_{T_{c}} = 2 \\left( \\frac{V_{dc}}{2V_{c}} V_{m}\\sin(\\omega_{1} t) \\right) = \\frac{V_{dc}}{V_{c}} V_{m}\\sin(\\omega_{1} t)$$\n\nSubstituting the modulation index $m_{a} = V_{m}/V_{c}$:\n$$\\langle v_{o}(t) \\rangle_{T_{c}} = m_{a} V_{dc} \\sin(\\omega_{1} t)$$\n\nThis is the fundamental component of the full-bridge output voltage $v_{o}(t)$. The amplitude of this fundamental component, $\\hat{V}_{1}^{\\mathrm{uni}}$, is:\n$$\\hat{V}_{1}^{\\mathrm{uni}} = m_{a} V_{dc}$$\n\nIn summary, the fundamental amplitude for the half-bridge bipolar SPWM is $\\hat{V}_{1}^{\\mathrm{bip}} = \\frac{1}{2} m_{a} V_{dc}$, and for the full-bridge unipolar SPWM is $\\hat{V}_{1}^{\\mathrm{uni}} = m_{a} V_{dc}$.",

The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires us to calculate the RMS value of a voltage ripple, which is modeled as a symmetric triangle wave within an effective ripple period $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. The RMS value of a symmetric triangle wave with peak amplitude $A$ (and thus peak-to-peak amplitude $2A$) is given by:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{ripple, RMS}} = \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{3}} $$\nThe core of the problem is to determine the peak amplitude $A$ for both bipolar and unipolar modulation schemes.\n\nThe problem defines the ripple as the deviation between the time-varying reference voltage, $v_{\\mathrm{ref}}(t)$, and its piecewise-constant approximation, which results from a zero-order hold of the period-averaged value. Let us consider an effective ripple period $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ centered at a time $t_0$. The piecewise-constant approximation of the output over this interval is the average value of the reference at the center of the interval, $V_{\\mathrm{avg}} = v_{\\mathrm{ref}}(t_0)$.\n\nUnder the given assumption that $v_{\\mathrm{ref}}(t)$ is linear over this short interval, we can write:\n$$ v_{\\mathrm{ref}}(t) \\approx v_{\\mathrm{ref}}(t_0) + \\left. \\frac{dv_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{dt} \\right|_{t=t_0} (t-t_0) $$\nThe ripple voltage is the difference:\n$$ v_{\\mathrm{ripple}}(t) = v_{\\mathrm{ref}}(t) - V_{\\mathrm{avg}} \\approx \\left. \\frac{dv_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{dt} \\right|_{t=t_0} (t-t_0) $$\nfor $t \\in [t_0 - T_{\\mathrm{eff}}/2, t_0 + T_{\\mathrm{eff}}/2]$. This describes a sawtooth waveform varying from a minimum to a maximum value. The peak deviation from zero (the peak amplitude $A$) occurs at the ends of the interval, $t = t_0 \\pm T_{\\mathrm{eff}}/2$:\n$$ A = \\left| \\left. \\frac{dv_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{dt} \\right|_{t=t_0} \\times \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{2} \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| \\frac{dv_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{dt} \\right|_{t=t_0} T_{\\mathrm{eff}} $$\nThe problem specifies that the calculation must be performed at the fundamental zero-crossing of $v_{\\mathrm{ref}}(t)$. At this point, the sine function is zero and its rate of change is maximal. The reference voltage is $v_{\\mathrm{ref}}(t) = m_{a} V_{\\mathrm{dc}} \\sin(\\omega_{m} t)$, where $\\omega_{m} = 2\\pi f_{m}$. The derivative is:\n$$ \\frac{dv_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{dt} = m_{a} V_{\\mathrm{dc}} \\omega_{m} \\cos(\\omega_{m} t) $$\nAt the zero-crossing, $\\omega_m t = k\\pi$ for integer $k$, so $|\\cos(\\omega_m t)| = 1$. The maximum magnitude of the slope is:\n$$ \\left| \\frac{dv_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{dt} \\right|_{\\max} = m_{a} V_{\\mathrm{dc}} \\omega_{m} = m_{a} V_{\\mathrm{dc}} (2\\pi f_{m}) $$\nUsing the frequency ratio $m_{f} = f_{c}/f_{m}$ and the carrier period $T_{c} = 1/f_{c}$, we can write $f_{m} = f_{c}/m_{f} = 1/(m_{f}T_{c})$.\n$$ \\left| \\frac{dv_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{dt} \\right|_{\\max} = \\frac{2\\pi m_{a} V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{m_{f} T_{c}} $$\nNow we can establish the RMS ripple expressions for the two modulation schemes by determining their respective effective ripple periods, $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n\n**1. Bipolar SPWM**\nIn bipolar SPWM, the inverter output voltage switches at the carrier frequency, $f_{c}$. Therefore, the effective period of the ripple is the carrier period.\n$$ T_{\\mathrm{eff, bipolar}} = T_{c} $$\nThe peak amplitude of the ripple is:\n$$ A_{\\mathrm{bipolar}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| \\frac{dv_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{dt} \\right|_{\\max} T_{\\mathrm{eff, bipolar}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi m_{a} V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{m_{f} T_{c}} \\right) T_{c} = \\frac{\\pi m_{a} V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{m_{f}} $$\nThe RMS value of the ripple is:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{ripple, RMS, bipolar}} = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{bipolar}}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\pi m_{a} V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{\\sqrt{3} m_{f}} $$\n\n**2. Unipolar SPWM**\nIn unipolar SPWM, the two legs of the full-bridge are modulated out of phase, which causes the output line voltage ripple to have a fundamental frequency of $2f_{c}$. This is a well-known advantage of unipolar modulation. The effective period of the ripple is therefore halved.\n$$ T_{\\mathrm{eff, unipolar}} = \\frac{T_{c}}{2} $$\nThe peak amplitude of the ripple is:\n$$ A_{\\mathrm{unipolar}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| \\frac{dv_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{dt} \\right|_{\\max} T_{\\mathrm{eff, unipolar}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi m_{a} V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{m_{f} T_{c}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{T_{c}}{2} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi m_{a} V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{2m_{f}} $$\nThe RMS value of the ripple is:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{ripple, RMS, unipolar}} = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{unipolar}}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\pi m_{a} V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{2\\sqrt{3} m_{f}} $$\nThis is exactly half the value obtained for bipolar SPWM.\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\nWe are given $V_{\\mathrm{dc}} = 700\\,\\mathrm{V}$, $m_{a} = 0.92$, and $m_{f} = 75$.\n\nFor bipolar SPWM:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{ripple, RMS, bipolar}} = \\frac{\\pi \\times 0.92 \\times 700}{\\sqrt{3} \\times 75} \\approx \\frac{2023.1856}{129.9038} \\approx 15.5744\\,\\mathrm{V} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $15.57\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nFor unipolar SPWM:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{ripple, RMS, unipolar}} = \\frac{1}{2} V_{\\mathrm{ripple, RMS, bipolar}} \\approx \\frac{15.5744}{2} \\approx 7.7872\\,\\mathrm{V} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $7.787\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nThe final answer is to be provided as a row vector $[\\text{bipolar value},\\, \\text{unipolar value}]$.",

Definition of Subharmonics in PWM Spectra**\nA periodic signal $g(t)$ with fundamental period $T_{0}$ and fundamental frequency $f_{0} = 1/T_{0}$ has a Fourier series representation consisting of spectral components at discrete frequencies $n f_{0}$ for integers $n \\ge 0$.\nIn the context of an inverter controlled by SPWM, the objective is to generate an output voltage with a fundamental component at a specific frequency, $f_{1}$. Ideally, the output voltage spectrum, $V_{o}(f)$, would contain a component at $f_{1}$ and its integer harmonics ($n f_{1}$ for $n \\ge 2$), plus high-frequency components related to the carrier frequency $f_{c}$.\n**Subharmonics** are defined as discrete spectral components in the output voltage spectrum that appear at frequencies below the desired fundamental frequency $f_{1}$. Their presence indicates that the fundamental period of the complete switching waveform, $T_{pattern}$, is longer than the period of the reference signal, $T_{1}=1/f_{1}$.\n\n**2. Waveform Periodicity with Rational Frequency Ratio**\nThe problem specifies a frequency modulation ratio $m_{f} = P/Q$, where $P$ and $Q$ are coprime integers and $Q > 1$. Let us determine the periodicity of the resulting output voltage waveform $v_{o}(t)$.\n\nThe reference signal is $v_{r}(t)$, which is periodic with period $T_{1} = 1/f_{1}$.\nThe carrier signal is $v_{c}(t)$, which is periodic with period $T_{c} = 1/f_{c}$.\nUsing the definition of $m_{f}$, we can express $T_{c}$ in terms of $T_{1}$:\n$$T_{c} = \\frac{1}{f_{c}} = \\frac{1}{m_{f} f_{1}} = \\frac{1}{(P/Q) f_{1}} = \\frac{Q}{P} T_{1}$$\nThe output waveform $v_{o}(t)$ is generated by the comparison of $v_{r}(t)$ and $v_{c}(t)$. The overall switching pattern repeats only when both the reference and carrier signals return to their initial phase relationship simultaneously. The period of this repeating pattern, $T_{pattern}$, is the least common multiple (LCM) of the individual periods $T_{1}$ and $T_{c}$:\n$$T_{pattern} = \\text{lcm}(T_{1}, T_{c}) = \\text{lcm}\\left(T_{1}, \\frac{Q}{P} T_{1}\\right)$$\nSince $P$ and $Q$ are coprime, the LCM is given by:\n$$T_{pattern} = Q \\cdot T_{1}$$\nThis means the complete switching waveform is periodic, but its period is $Q$ times longer than the period of the fundamental reference signal.\n\nThe fundamental frequency of the Fourier series for $v_{o}(t)$ is therefore:\n$$f_{0} = \\frac{1}{T_{pattern}} = \\frac{1}{Q T_{1}} = \\frac{f_{1}}{Q}$$\nConsequently, the Fourier spectrum of $v_{o}(t)$ consists of discrete spectral lines at integer multiples of this new, lower fundamental frequency:\n$$f_{n} = n f_{0} = n \\frac{f_{1}}{Q}, \\quad \\text{for integer } n \\geq 1$$\nFor any $n  Q$, the corresponding frequency component $n f_{1}/Q$ is less than $f_{1}$, thus constituting a subharmonic. The lowest possible frequency in the spectrum (the fundamental) is at $n=1$, which is $f_{1}/Q$.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Specific Case**\nThe problem provides the following parameters: $f_{1} = 50\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, $m_{a} = 0.8$, and $m_{f} = 77/2$.\nHere, $m_{f}$ is a rational number with $P=77$ and $Q=2$. $P$ and $Q$ are coprime.\n-   Since $Q=2$, the period of the output voltage waveform is $T_{pattern} = Q T_{1} = 2T_{1}$.\n-   The fundamental frequency of the output voltage spectrum is $f_{0} = f_{1}/Q = f_{1}/2$.\n-   With $f_{1} = 50\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, this fundamental frequency is $f_{0} = 50/2 = 25\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n-   The spectrum of $v_{o}(t)$ will contain discrete frequency components at integer multiples of $25\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. That is, the spectral lines are located at frequencies $n \\cdot (f_{1}/2)$ for $n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\n-   The lowest frequency component is the fundamental of the pattern, $f_0 = f_{1}/2 = 25\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. Since this is below the desired fundamental of $f_{1}=50\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, it is a subharmonic.\n-   The high-frequency content of the spectrum is clustered around multiples of the carrier frequency, $k f_{c}$. These groups of frequencies are known as carrier sidebands. The frequencies of these sidebands must also be integer multiples of the true fundamental frequency, $f_{0} = f_{1}/2$. A general expression for the location of these sidebands that is consistent with the overall periodicity is $k f_{c} \\pm n f_{0}$, which is $k f_{c} \\pm n (f_{1}/2)$.\n\nThe condition $m_{a} = 0.8$ ($m_{a} \\le 1$) ensures the inverter operates in the linear modulation region, without overmodulation. The generation of subharmonics in this context is purely a consequence of the rational, non-integer frequency ratio $m_{f}$ and is not related to overmodulation.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The switching waveform is periodic with period $2T_{1}$, and the spectrum contains discrete lines at $n f_{1}/2$ and carrier sidebands at $k f_{c} \\pm n f_{1}/2$ for integers $n, k \\geq 0$. The lowest subharmonic appears at $f_{1}/2$.**\n-   **Periodicity:** Our derivation shows $T_{pattern} = Q T_{1}$ and with $Q=2$, the period is indeed $2T_{1}$. This is correct.\n-   **Spectral Lines:** The fundamental frequency is $f_{1}/2$, so the spectrum consists of discrete lines at $n f_{1}/2$. This is correct.\n-   **Sidebands:** The description of carrier sidebands having components at $k f_{c} \\pm n f_{1}/2$ is consistent with the fact that all spectral components must be integer multiples of $f_{1}/2$. A combination of $f_c = (77/2)f_1$ and $f_1/2$ will always yield a multiple of $f_1/2$. This description is accurate.\n-   **Lowest Subharmonic:** The lowest frequency component is the fundamental of the pattern, $f_{1}/2$. This is correct.\nThis statement is fully consistent with our derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The switching waveform is periodic with period $T_{1}$, and the spectrum contains only integer harmonics of $f_{1}$ and sidebands clustered at $k f_{c} \\pm n f_{1}$; no components below $f_{1}$ exist when $m_{a} \\leq 1$.**\n-   The period is not $T_{1}$; it is $2T_{1}$ because $m_{f}$ is not an integer. The spectrum contains subharmonics, with the lowest component being $f_{1}/2$. The claim that no components below $f_{1}$ exist is false. This scenario (period $T_1$, no subharmonics) is characteristic of integer $m_f$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Subharmonics only occur when the amplitude modulation index satisfies $m_{a} > 1$ (overmodulation). With $m_{a} = 0.8$ no low-frequency components appear irrespective of $m_{f}$.**\n-   This statement incorrectly attributes subharmonics to overmodulation. While overmodulation ($m_a > 1$) does introduce low-order harmonics, it is not the cause of subharmonics in the sense of frequencies below $f_1$. Subharmonics of this type are a direct result of a rational, non-integer frequency ratio $m_{f} = P/Q$ with $Q1$. Since $m_f = 77/2$ and $m_a=0.8$, subharmonics will exist.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. When $m_{f}$ is noninteger, the switching waveform becomes aperiodic and produces continuous low-frequency noise instead of discrete spectral lines; discrete lines are recovered only when $m_{f}$ is integer.**\n-   This statement is imprecise. A noninteger $m_{f}$ can be rational or irrational. For a *rational* noninteger $m_{f} = 77/2$, the waveform is periodic, and the spectrum is discrete. An aperiodic (quasi-periodic) waveform with a non-discrete spectrum occurs for *irrational* $m_{f}$. Therefore, the premise is false for the given conditions.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. For $m_{f} = 77/2$, the lowest subharmonic is at $f_{c}/77$, and carrier sidebands appear at $k f_{c} \\pm n f_{c}/77$, independent of $f_{1}$.**\n-   The frequency of the lowest subharmonic is $f_{c}/77 = (m_f f_1)/77 = ((77/2)f_1)/77 = f_1/2$. This part of the statement is mathematically correct. However, the final clause \"independent of $f_1$\" is false. The subharmonic frequency $f_{1}/2$ is clearly dependent on $f_{1}$. The same applies to the carrier sidebands whose locations are functions of $f_c$ and thus $f_1$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
