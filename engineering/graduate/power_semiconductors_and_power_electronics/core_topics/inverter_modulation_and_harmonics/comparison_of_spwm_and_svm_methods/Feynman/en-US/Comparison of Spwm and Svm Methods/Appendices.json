Derivation of Active Vector Magnitude and Hexagon Circumradius\n\nA three-phase, two-level inverter has $2^3 = 8$ possible switching states, defined by which switch in each phase leg is on. Let the switching function for phase $k \\in \\{a, b, c\\}$ be $S_k$, where $S_k = 1$ if the upper switch is on (connected to $+V_{\\mathrm{dc}}/2$) and $S_k = 0$ if the lower switch is on (connected to $-V_{\\mathrm{dc}}/2$). The actual pole voltage with respect to the DC link midpoint is not directly used; instead, we derive the phase-to-neutral voltages assuming a balanced, star-connected load with an isolated neutral. The voltage of phase $k$ with respect to the negative DC rail is $v_{k0} = S_k V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$. The neutral point voltage with respect to the negative DC rail is $v_{n0} = \\frac{1}{3}(v_{a0} + v_{b0} + v_{c0})$. The phase-to-neutral voltage for phase $a$ is then:\n$$\nv_a(t) = v_{an} = v_{a0} - v_{n0} = S_a V_{\\mathrm{dc}} - \\frac{1}{3}(S_a+S_b+S_c)V_{\\mathrm{dc}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{3}(2S_a - S_b - S_c)\n$$\nBy cyclic permutation, similar expressions are found for $v_b$ and $v_c$.\n\nThe eight switching states $(S_a, S_b, S_c)$ result in eight discrete voltage vectors. The states $(0,0,0)$ and $(1,1,1)$ produce zero phase-to-neutral voltages, corresponding to two zero vectors at the origin of the $\\alpha\\beta$-plane. The remaining six states are the active vectors, which form the vertices of a hexagon.\n\nLet us compute the space vector for the state $(1,0,0)$:\n$S_a = 1$, $S_b = 0$, $S_c = 0$.\nThe phase voltages are:\n$v_a = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{3}(2(1) - 0 - 0) = \\frac{2}{3}V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$\n$v_b = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{3}(2(0) - 1 - 0) = -\\frac{1}{3}V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$\n$v_c = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{3}(2(0) - 1 - 0) = -\\frac{1}{3}V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$\n\nApplying the Clarke transformation:\n$v_{\\alpha} = \\frac{2}{3}\\left(v_a - \\frac{1}{2}v_b - \\frac{1}{2}v_c\\right) = \\frac{2}{3}\\left[\\frac{2}{3}V_{\\mathrm{dc}} - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(-\\frac{1}{3}V_{\\mathrm{dc}}\\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(-\\frac{1}{3}V_{\\mathrm{dc}}\\right)\\right] = \\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6}\\right)V_{\\mathrm{dc}} = \\frac{2}{3}(1)V_{\\mathrm{dc}} = \\frac{2}{3}V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$\n$v_{\\beta} = \\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}v_b - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}v_c\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\left[-\\frac{1}{3}V_{\\mathrm{dc}} - \\left(-\\frac{1}{3}V_{\\mathrm{dc}}\\right)\\right] = 0$\n\nThe space vector for state $(1,0,0)$ is $V_1 = \\frac{2}{3}V_{\\mathrm{dc}} + j0$. Its magnitude is $\\frac{2}{3}V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$.\nDue to the symmetry of the three-phase system, all six active vectors will have the same magnitude. For example, for state $(1,1,0)$, the vector is $V_2 = \\frac{1}{3}V_{\\mathrm{dc}} + j\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$, with magnitude $\\sqrt{(\\frac{1}{3}V_{\\mathrm{dc}})^2 + (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}V_{\\mathrm{dc}})^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{3}{9}}V_{\\mathrm{dc}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{9}}V_{\\mathrm{dc}} = \\frac{2}{3}V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$.\n\nThe magnitude of the active switching space vectors is thus $\\frac{2}{3}V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$. These vectors are the vertices of the hexagon of achievable states. The distance from the origin to any vertex of a regular hexagon is its circumradius, $R_{\\mathrm{circ}}$.\nTherefore, $R_{\\mathrm{circ}} = \\frac{2}{3}V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$, which is directly proportional to $V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$.\n\n2.  Determination of Hexagon Inradius\n\nFor a regular hexagon, the inradius $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$ (the radius of the largest inscribed circle, tangent to the midpoints of the sides) is related to the circumradius $R_{\\mathrm{circ}}$ by the geometric relation:\n$R_{\\mathrm{in}} = R_{\\mathrm{circ}} \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{6})$\nSubstituting the value of $R_{\\mathrm{circ}}$:\n$R_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}V_{\\mathrm{dc}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}V_{\\mathrm{dc}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$\n\n3.  SVPWM Overmodulation Onset\n\nThe reference space vector is generated from the balanced sinusoidal reference phase voltages. Applying the Clarke transform to the reference voltages:\n$v_{a}^*(t) = V_{m}\\cos(\\omega t)$\n$v_{b}^*(t) = V_{m}\\cos(\\omega t - 2\\pi/3)$\n$v_{c}^*(t) = V_{m}\\cos(\\omega t - 4\\pi/3)$\n\n$v_{\\alpha}^*(t) = \\frac{2}{3}\\left[V_{m}\\cos(\\omega t) - \\frac{1}{2}V_{m}\\cos(\\omega t - \\frac{2\\pi}{3}) - \\frac{1}{2}V_{m}\\cos(\\omega t - \\frac{4\\pi}{3})\\right]$\nUsing the identity $v_a + v_b + v_c = 0$ for balanced three-phase systems, we can simplify $v_b+v_c = -v_a$.\n$v_{\\alpha}^*(t) = \\frac{2}{3}\\left[V_{m}\\cos(\\omega t) - \\frac{1}{2}(-V_{m}\\cos(\\omega t))\\right] = \\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\frac{3}{2}V_{m}\\cos(\\omega t)\\right) = V_{m}\\cos(\\omega t)$\n$v_{\\beta}^*(t) = \\frac{2}{3}\\left[\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}V_{m}\\cos(\\omega t - \\frac{2\\pi}{3}) - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}V_{m}\\cos(\\omega t - \\frac{4\\pi}{3})\\right] = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}V_{m}\\left[\\cos(\\omega t - \\frac{2\\pi}{3}) - \\cos(\\omega t + \\frac{2\\pi}{3})\\right]$\nUsing the identity $\\cos(A-B) - \\cos(A+B) = 2\\sin A \\sin B$:\n$v_{\\beta}^*(t) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}V_{m}[2\\sin(\\omega t)\\sin(\\frac{2\\pi}{3})] = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}V_{m}[2\\sin(\\omega t)\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}] = V_{m}\\sin(\\omega t)$\nThe reference space vector is $v_{\\alpha\\beta}^*(t) = V_{m}\\cos(\\omega t) + jV_{m}\\sin(\\omega t)$, which describes a circle of radius $V_m$.\n\nIn SVPWM, the reference vector is synthesized by averaging the adjacent inverter state vectors over a switching period. This is possible as long as the reference vector lies within the hexagon formed by the active vectors. Linear modulation is maintained as long as the circular trajectory of the reference vector is contained within this hexagon. The onset of overmodulation occurs when the trajectory first touches the hexagon boundary. The largest circle that can be inscribed in the hexagon has a radius equal to the hexagon's inradius, $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$.\nThus, for the maximum linear modulation, the radius of the reference circle must equal the inradius:\n$V_{m, \\mathrm{max}} = R_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$\n\nThe modulation index at the onset of overmodulation for SVPWM is found using the definition $m \\equiv \\frac{2V_{m}}{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}$, with $V_m = V_{m, \\mathrm{max}}$:\n$m_{\\mathrm{SVPWM}} = \\frac{2 V_{m, \\mathrm{max}}}{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}} = \\frac{2 (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}V_{\\mathrm{dc}})}{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n\n4.  SPWM Overmodulation Onset and Comparison\n\nThe problem states that for Sinusoidal PWM (SPWM), the linear region is defined by the constraint $m \\leq 1$. This implies that the onset of overmodulation occurs precisely at $m_{\\mathrm{SPWM}} = 1$. This condition arises from the fundamental principle of SPWM, where the sinusoidal reference voltage for a phase, $v_k^*(t)$, must not exceed the peak amplitude of the triangular carrier wave, $V_{\\mathrm{carrier}}$. In a typical setup, the carrier wave amplitude is set to $V_{\\mathrm{dc}}/2$. The condition for linear operation is $V_m \\leq V_{\\mathrm{carrier}} = V_{\\mathrm{dc}}/2$. Substituting $V_m = V_{\\mathrm{dc}}/2$ into the definition of $m$:\n$m_{\\mathrm{SPWM}} = \\frac{2(V_{\\mathrm{dc}}/2)}{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}} = 1$\n\nComparing the two onsets:\n$m_{\\mathrm{SPWM}} = 1$\n$m_{\\mathrm{SVPWM}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 1.1547$\n\nThe modulation index for the onset of overmodulation is higher for SVPWM than for SPWM. This indicates that SVPWM allows for the synthesis of a higher fundamental output voltage (by approximately $15.5\\%$) before entering the non-linear region, which is a key advantage of the SVPWM technique.\n\nThe final answer is the pair of onset modulation indices $(m_{\\mathrm{SPWM}}, m_{\\mathrm{SVPWM}})$.",

            "problem": "A $3$-phase, $2$-level voltage-source inverter feeding a balanced wye-connected load with isolated neutral is supplied by a direct current (DC) link of total voltage $V_{dc}$, realized as two equal capacitors in series so that the midpoint node $n$ is at $+V_{dc}/2$ relative to the negative rail and $-V_{dc}/2$ relative to the positive rail, under ideal conditions. Each inverter leg employs ideal switches that connect the corresponding phase pole to either the positive rail or the negative rail. Let the leg switching functions be $S_{a}, S_{b}, S_{c} \\in \\{0,1\\}$, where $S_{x}=1$ denotes connection of phase pole $x \\in \\{a,b,c\\}$ to $+V_{dc}/2$ and $S_{x}=0$ denotes connection to $-V_{dc}/2$. Denote the instantaneous pole (leg) voltages to the DC-link midpoint by $v_{an}, v_{bn}, v_{cn}$, so that $v_{xn} = +V_{dc}/2$ when $S_{x}=1$ and $v_{xn} = -V_{dc}/2$ when $S_{x}=0$. Define the instantaneous common-mode voltage as $v_{cm} = \\left(v_{an} + v_{bn} + v_{cn}\\right)/3$.\n\nAt an instant representative of a Space Vector Modulation (SVM) active-vector interval, the switching state is $S_{a}=1$, $S_{b}=0$, $S_{c}=1$.

Express the final answer in volts. No numerical rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. It describes a standard configuration in power electronics and asks for a derivation and justification based on fundamental principles. All necessary information is provided.\n\nThe first step is to determine the instantaneous common-mode voltage $v_{cm}$ for the specified switching state. The problem defines the system and the relevant variables.\nThe total DC link voltage is $V_{dc}$. The DC link is center-tapped at point $n$, so the positive rail is at a potential of $+V_{dc}/2$ with respect to $n$, and the negative rail is at $-V_{dc}/2$ with respect to $n$.\nThe switching function $S_x$ for phase $x \\in \\{a,b,c\\}$ determines the connection of the phase pole to the DC rails.\nIf $S_x = 1$, the pole is connected to the positive rail, and the pole voltage with respect to the midpoint $n$ is $v_{xn} = +V_{dc}/2$.\nIf $S_x = 0$, the pole is connected to the negative rail, and the pole voltage is $v_{xn} = -V_{dc}/2$.\nThis relationship can be expressed compactly as $v_{xn} = V_{dc}(S_x - 1/2)$.\n\nThe problem specifies the switching state at a particular instant as $S_a=1$, $S_b=0$, and $S_c=1$. This corresponds to the active voltage vector $V_5$ in standard space vector notation.\nFor this state, the individual pole voltages are:\n$v_{an} = V_{dc}(S_a - 1/2) = V_{dc}(1 - 1/2) = +\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$\n$v_{bn} = V_{dc}(S_b - 1/2) = V_{dc}(0 - 1/2) = -\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$\n$v_{cn} = V_{dc}(S_c - 1/2) = V_{dc}(1 - 1/2) = +\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$\n\nThe instantaneous common-mode voltage $v_{cm}$ is defined as the average of the three pole voltages:\n$v_{cm} = \\frac{v_{an} + v_{bn} + v_{cn}}{3}$\nSubstituting the calculated values for the given state:\n$v_{cm} = \\frac{(+V_{dc}/2) + (-V_{dc}/2) + (+V_{dc}/2)}{3} = \\frac{V_{dc}/2}{3} = \\frac{V_{dc}}{6}$\n\nNext, we must justify, using first principles, the role of this common-mode voltage.\nThe system consists of the inverter and a balanced, wye-connected load with an isolated neutral point, denoted as $o$.\nThe instantaneous phase voltage across the load for phase $x$ is $v_{xo}$, where $x \\in \\{a,b,c\\}$. Applying Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) to a loop from the DC link midpoint $n$, through the inverter leg $x$, through the load phase $x$, to the load neutral $o$, and back to $n$, we obtain:\n$v_{xn} - v_{xo} - v_{on} = 0$\nwhere $v_{on}$ is the voltage of the load neutral point $o$ with respect to the DC link midpoint $n$.\nThis can be rearranged to express the load phase voltage as:\n$v_{xo} = v_{xn} - v_{on}$\n\nSince the load neutral is isolated, there is no path for zero-sequence current to flow. The sum of the instantaneous phase currents must be zero:\n$i_a + i_b + i_c = 0$\nThe load is balanced, meaning the impedance of each phase is identical. Let this be represented by an operator $Z_{load}$ (which could be a simple resistance $R$ or a more complex impedance $R+L\\frac{d}{dt}$). The phase voltages are related to the phase currents by $v_{xo} = Z_{load}[i_x]$.\nSumming the phase voltages across the load:\n$v_{ao} + v_{bo} + v_{co} = Z_{load}[i_a] + Z_{load}[i_b] + Z_{load}[i_c] = Z_{load}[i_a + i_b + i_c]$\nSince the sum of currents is zero, the sum of the instantaneous load phase voltages must also be zero:\n$v_{ao} + v_{bo} + v_{co} = 0$\n\nNow, we sum the KVL equations for all three phases:\n$\\sum_{x=a,b,c} v_{xo} = \\sum_{x=a,b,c} (v_{xn} - v_{on})$\n$(v_{ao} + v_{bo} + v_{co}) = (v_{an} + v_{bn} + v_{cn}) - 3v_{on}$\nSubstituting the previous result that the sum of load phase voltages is zero:\n$0 = (v_{an} + v_{bn} + v_{cn}) - 3v_{on}$\nSolving for $v_{on}$:\n$v_{on} = \\frac{v_{an} + v_{bn} + v_{cn}}{3}$\nThis expression is precisely the definition of the common-mode voltage $v_{cm}$. Therefore, $v_{on} = v_{cm}$.\n\nThis demonstrates how the common-mode voltage participates in forming the load phase voltages. The voltage of the load's floating neutral with respect to the DC link's midpoint is equal to the inverter's common-mode voltage. The instantaneous load phase voltage $v_{xo}$ is the difference between the inverter pole voltage $v_{xn}$ and this common-mode voltage:\n$v_{xo} = v_{xn} - v_{cm}$\nThe common-mode voltage is thus subtracted from each pole voltage to yield the voltage that actually appears across the load terminals.\n\nNext, we examine why the common-mode voltage cancels in the instantaneous line-to-line voltages. The line-to-line voltage, for example $v_{ab}$, is defined as the potential difference between phase pole $a$ and phase pole $b$. This is equivalent to the difference in load phase voltages.\n$v_{ab} = v_{ao} - v_{bo}$\nUsing the expression for phase voltage derived above:\n$v_{ab} = (v_{an} - v_{on}) - (v_{bn} - v_{on})$\n$v_{ab} = v_{an} - v_{on} - v_{bn} + v_{on}$\n$v_{ab} = v_{an} - v_{bn}$\nSimilarly for the other line-to-line voltages:\n$v_{bc} = v_{bn} - v_{cn}$\n$v_{ca} = v_{cn} - v_{an}$\nThe term $v_{on} = v_{cm}$ is eliminated in the subtraction. This shows that the line-to-line voltages are determined solely by the differences between the inverter pole voltages and are independent of the common-mode voltage.\n\nFinally, we connect these observations to the structural differences between Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM) and Space Vector Modulation (SVM).\nThe fundamental goal of modulation is to produce a desired set of fundamental-frequency sinusoidal output voltages. The difference between SPWM and SVM lies in how the instantaneous pole voltages $v_{an}, v_{bn}, v_{cn}$ are generated to achieve this goal.\n\nIn conventional SPWM, each inverter leg is modulated independently by comparing a sinusoidal reference waveform with a high-frequency triangular carrier wave. This method implicitly defines the pole voltages. The resulting common-mode voltage $v_{cm}$ is an artifact of this process; it is not deliberately shaped. The instantaneous phase-to-neutral load voltages $v_{xo}$ have a waveform that appears sinusoidal, overlaid with high-frequency switching ripple, because the common-mode voltage in SPWM is primarily high-frequency content.\n\nIn SVM, the three phase legs are treated as a single entity. The inverter is seen as generating one of eight discrete voltage vectors in the complex plane. A desired reference voltage vector is synthesized by time-averaging adjacent vectors (typically two active vectors and one or both zero vectors) over a switching period. SVM has a degree of freedom in choosing the zero vectors ($[000]$ or $[111]$), which produce different common-mode voltages ($v_{cm} = -V_{dc}/2$ and $v_{cm} = +V_{dc}/2$, respectively) but identical (zero) line-to-line voltages. SVM exploits this freedom to inject a specific low-frequency common-mode signal into the pole voltage references. A common approach is to add a zero-sequence signal that centers the three-phase reference waveforms, thereby maximizing the use of the available DC link voltage. This injected common-mode signal makes the instantaneous pole voltage waveforms $v_{xn}$ non-sinusoidal. Consequently, the instantaneous load phase voltages $v_{xo} = v_{xn} - v_{cm}$ also become non-sinusoidal (they contain harmonics, primarily the third harmonic and its multiples).\n\nHowever, as we have proven, this injected common-mode voltage cancels out completely in the line-to-line voltages. The line-to-line voltages $v_{ab}, v_{bc}, v_{ca}$ remain functions only of the differences between the pole voltages, which are controlled to produce pure sinusoidal fundamental components. By deliberately \"distorting\" the phase voltages with a common-mode signal, SVM can achieve a larger fundamental amplitude for the line-to-line voltages compared to SPWM for the same DC link voltage $V_{dc}$ (approximately a $15.5\\%$ increase in the linear modulation range). This is the primary advantage of SVM over SPWM in terms of DC bus utilization. Although the instantaneous load phase voltage waveforms differ significantly between the two methods due to the different $v_{cm}$ profiles, the resulting fundamental line-to-line voltages are what matters for most three-phase AC loads, and SVM generates them more effectively.",

Define the sector index $k \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$ as $k = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\theta \\bmod 360^\\circ}{60^\\circ} \\right\\rfloor + 1$, and define the in-sector angle $\\beta$ (in radians) as $\\beta = \\left(\\theta \\bmod 60^\\circ\\right) \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{180}$.\n- In linear modulation with normalized index $m \\in [0,1]$, the dwell times for the adjacent active vectors in sector $k$ are defined by\n$$\nT_1 = T_s \\, m \\, \\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3} - \\beta\\right), \\quad\nT_2 = T_s \\, m \\, \\sin(\\beta), \\quad\nT_0 = T_s - T_1 - T_2,\n$$\nwhich ensures $T_1, T_2, T_0 \\ge 0$ for $m \\in [0,1]$ and $\\beta \\in [0,\\pi/3]$.\n- A computation meets its deadline if and only if\n$$\n\\tau + t_{\\mathrm{isr}} + t_{\\mathrm{write}} + t_{\\mathrm{guard}} \\le T_s,\n$$\nso the maximum allowable computation latency is\n$$\n\\tau_{\\max} = T_s - \\left(t_{\\mathrm{isr}} + t_{\\mathrm{write}} + t_{\\mathrm{guard}}\\right).\n$$\n\nTasks:\n1. For each test case, compute the SVPWM sector index $k$, the dwell times $T_1$, $T_2$, and $T_0$ (expressed in seconds), using the definitions above. Angles provided in degrees must be converted to radians for trigonometric functions. All final dwell times must be reported in seconds.\n2. Compute the maximum allowable computation latency $\\tau_{\\max,\\mathrm{svm}}$ for SVPWM, using its specific $t_{\\mathrm{write}}$ and $t_{\\mathrm{guard}}$, and determine if the given computation latency $\\tau_{\\mathrm{svm}}$ meets the deadline.
