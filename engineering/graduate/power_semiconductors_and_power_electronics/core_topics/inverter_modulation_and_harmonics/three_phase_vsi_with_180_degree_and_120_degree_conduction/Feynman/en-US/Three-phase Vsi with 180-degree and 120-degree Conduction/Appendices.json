            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of phase-to-neutral load voltages for a three-phase Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) feeding a balanced, star-connected resistive load under two different conduction modes: $180^{\\circ}$ and $120^{\\circ}$. The load neutral point $O$ is floating.\n\nThe fundamental relationship between the inverter pole voltages relative to the DC bus midpoint $N$, $v_{xN}$, the load phase-to-neutral voltages, $v_{xO}$, and the voltage of the load neutral point relative to the DC bus midpoint, $v_{NO}$, is given by:\n$$ v_{xO} = v_{xN} - v_{NO} \\quad \\text{for } x \\in \\{a,b,c\\} $$\nThe key to solving this problem is to determine $v_{NO}$ for each case and each sector. This is achieved by applying Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at the floating load neutral node $O$. The KCL equation is:\n$$ i_a + i_b + i_c = 0 $$\nFor the balanced resistive load with equal phase resistances $R$, the phase currents are given by Ohm's law: $i_x = v_{xO}/R$. Substituting this into the KCL equation yields:\n$$ \\frac{v_{aO}}{R} + \\frac{v_{bO}}{R} + \\frac{v_{cO}}{R} = 0 \\implies v_{aO} + v_{bO} + v_{cO} = 0 $$\nThis relation holds as long as a current path exists for all three phases.\n\nLet's denote the DC voltage levels as $V \\equiv V_{\\mathrm{dc}}/2$.

Thus, the condition $v_{aO} + v_{bO} + v_{cO} = 0$ is always applicable. We can express the load neutral voltage $v_{NO}$ by substituting $v_{xO} = v_{xN} - v_{NO}$ into this sum:\n$$ (v_{aN} - v_{NO}) + (v_{bN} - v_{NO}) + (v_{cN} - v_{NO}) = 0 $$\n$$ v_{aN} + v_{bN} + v_{cN} - 3 v_{NO} = 0 $$\n$$ v_{NO} = \\frac{v_{aN} + v_{bN} + v_{cN}}{3} $$\nWe now compute the phase voltage $v_{aO} = v_{aN} - v_{NO}$ for each of the six sectors.\n\n- **Sector $I$**: $v_{aN}=+V$, $v_{bN}=-V$, $v_{cN}=-V$.\n  $v_{NO} = \\frac{V - V - V}{3} = -\\frac{V}{3} = -\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{6}$.\n  $v_{aO} = v_{aN} - v_{NO} = V - (-\\frac{V}{3}) = \\frac{4V}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}\\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{3}$.\n\n- **Sector $II$**: $v_{aN}=+V$, $v_{bN}=+V$, $v_{cN}=-V$.\n  $v_{NO} = \\frac{V + V - V}{3} = \\frac{V}{3} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{6}$.\n  $v_{aO} = v_{aN} - v_{NO} = V - \\frac{V}{3} = \\frac{2V}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{3}$.\n\n- **Sector $III$**: $v_{aN}=-V$, $v_{bN}=+V$, $v_{cN}=-V$.\n  $v_{NO} = \\frac{-V + V - V}{3} = -\\frac{V}{3} = -\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{6}$.\n  $v_{aO} = v_{aN} - v_{NO} = -V - (-\\frac{V}{3}) = -\\frac{2V}{3} = -\\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{3}$.\n\n- **Sector $IV$**: $v_{aN}=-V$, $v_{bN}=+V$, $v_{cN}=+V$.\n  $v_{NO} = \\frac{-V + V + V}{3} = \\frac{V}{3} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{6}$.\n  $v_{aO} = v_{aN} - v_{NO} = -V - \\frac{V}{3} = -\\frac{4V}{3} = -\\frac{4}{3}\\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{2V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{3}$.\n\n- **Sector $V$**: $v_{aN}=-V$, $v_{bN}=-V$, $v_{cN}=+V$.\n  $v_{NO} = \\frac{-V - V + V}{3} = -\\frac{V}{3} = -\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{6}$.\n  $v_{aO} = v_{aN} - v_{NO} = -V - (-\\frac{V}{3}) = -\\frac{2V}{3} = -\\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{3}$.\n\n- **Sector $VI$**: $v_{aN}=+V$, $v_{bN}=-V$, $v_{cN}=+V$.\n  $v_{NO} = \\frac{V - V + V}{3} = \\frac{V}{3} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{6}$.\n  $v_{aO} = v_{aN} - v_{NO} = V - \\frac{V}{3} = \\frac{2V}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{3}$.\n\nThe six values for $v_{aO}$ in $180^{\\circ}$ conduction mode are: $\\{\\frac{2V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{3}, \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{3}, -\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{3}, -\\frac{2V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{3}, -\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{3}, \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{3}\\}$.\n\n**Case B: $120^{\\circ}$ Conduction Mode**\n\nIn this mode, one phase leg is always off (floating) at any given time. Let phase $x$ be the floating phase. This means the inverter terminal $x$ is not connected to either the positive or negative DC rail, so no current flows from the inverter into this phase. Consequently, the phase current $i_x$ is zero.\n$$ i_x = 0 $$\nThe phase-to-neutral load voltage $v_{xO}$ is given by Ohm's law:\n$$ v_{xO} = i_x R $$\nSince $i_x = 0$, it follows directly that:\n$$ v_{xO} = 0 $$\nThis result holds for the floating phase in any sector.\n\nThe problem statement asks to derive an expression for $v_{xO}$ via the constraint $v_{aO}+v_{bO}+v_{cO}=0$. As established, this constraint is a consequence of KCL at the isolated neutral node $O$ when all phases conduct. If phase $x$ is floating, its current $i_x=0$, which implies $v_{xO}=0$ for a resistive load. Substituting $v_{xO}=0$ into the sum of currents yields $i_y+i_z=0$ for the two conducting phases. For a resistive load, this implies $v_{yO}+v_{zO}=0$. So, if we were to use the voltage sum constraint, we could write $v_{xO} = -(v_{yO}+v_{zO})$. Since for the conducting phases $v_{yO}+v_{zO}=0$, it follows that $v_{xO}=-(0)=0$. Both lines of reasoning lead to the same conclusion.\n\nThe problem asks for the phase-to-neutral voltage of the floating phase in each sector. Based on the above derivation, this voltage is always zero.\n\n- **Sector $I$**: Phase $c$ is floating. $v_{cO} = 0$.\n- **Sector $II$**: Phase $b$ is floating. $v_{bO} = 0$.\n- **Sector $III$**: Phase $a$ is floating. $v_{aO} = 0$.\n- **Sector $IV$**: Phase $c$ is floating. $v_{cO} = 0$.\n- **Sector $V$**: Phase $b$ is floating. $v_{bO} = 0$.\n- **Sector $VI$**: Phase $a$ is floating. $v_{aO} = 0$.\n\nThe six values for the floating phase voltage $v_{xO}$ in $120^{\\circ}$ conduction mode are: $\\{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0\\}$.\n\nCombining both cases, the final ordered sequence of twelve values is:\n$\\{v_{aO}^{I},v_{aO}^{II},v_{aO}^{III},v_{aO}^{IV},v_{aO}^{V},v_{aO}^{VI}\\}$ from Case A, followed by $\\{v_{xO}^{I},v_{xO}^{II},v_{xO}^{III},v_{xO}^{IV},v_{xO}^{V},v_{xO}^{VI}\\}$ from Case B.\n- Case A results: $\\frac{2V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{3}, \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{3}, -\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{3}, -\\frac{2V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{3}, -\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{3}, \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{3}$\n- Case B results: $0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0$",

Let us calculate the number of transitions for this sequence.\n\n1.  $V_1 \\to V_2$: $(1,0,0) \\to (1,1,0)$. Only $S_b$ changes ($0 \\to 1$). Number of transitions = $1$.\n2.  $V_2 \\to V_3$: $(1,1,0) \\to (0,1,0)$. Only $S_a$ changes ($1 \\to 0$). Number of transitions = $1$.\n3.  $V_3 \\to V_4$: $(0,1,0) \\to (0,1,1)$. Only $S_c$ changes ($0 \\to 1$). Number of transitions = $1$.\n4.  $V_4 \\to V_5$: $(0,1,1) \\to (0,0,1)$. Only $S_b$ changes ($1 \\to 0$). Number of transitions = $1$.\n5.  $V_5 \\to V_6$: $(0,0,1) \\to (1,0,1)$. Only $S_a$ changes ($0 \\to 1$). Number of transitions = $1$.\n6.  $V_6 \\to V_1$: $(1,0,1) \\to (1,0,0)$. Only $S_c$ changes ($1 \\to 0$). Number of transitions = $1$.\n\nThe total number of transitions for one full cycle is the sum of transitions at each step: $1+1+1+1+1+1 = 6$.\n\nTo confirm this is the minimum, we note that a transition between any two distinct states requires at least one switch to change state, so the minimum number of transitions per step is $1$. Since the cycle consists of $6$ distinct states, there are $6$ steps. Thus, the theoretical minimum total number of transitions is $6 \\times 1 = 6$. The sequence $V_1 \\to V_2 \\to V_3 \\to V_4 \\to V_5 \\to V_6 \\to V_1$ achieves this minimum. Any sequence that \"skips\" an adjacent vector on the hexagon, for example $V_1 \\to V_3$, would involve a Hamming distance of $2$ or more, leading to a higher total transition count.\n\nTherefore, for $180^\\circ$ conduction, the minimal sequence is the adjacent-vector traversal, with a minimal total of $6$ transitions per cycle.\n\n### Part 2: $120^\\circ$ Conduction Mode\n\nIn this mode, at any instant, one leg is floating while the other two are connected to opposite DC rails. The leg status is represented by a ternary triplet $T = (T_a, T_b, T_c)$, where $T_x \\in \\{1, 0, \\chi\\}$, with $\\chi$ denoting the floating state. To produce torque in a motor, the six necessary states over a cycle involve current flowing between two phases. Let's denote the state where current flows from phase $x$ to phase $y$ as $S_{xy}$.\n\nThe six states are:\n-   $S_{ab}: T = (1, 0, \\chi)$ (Leg $a$ positive, $b$ negative, $c$ floating)\n-   $S_{ac}: T = (1, \\chi, 0)$ (Leg $a$ positive, $c$ negative, $b$ floating)\n-   $S_{bc}: T = (\\chi, 1, 0)$ (Leg $b$ positive, $c$ negative, $a$ floating)\n-   $S_{ba}: T = (0, 1, \\chi)$ (Leg $b$ positive, $a$ negative, $c$ floating)\n-   $S_{ca}: T = (0, \\chi, 1)$ (Leg $c$ positive, $a$ negative, $b$ floating)\n-   $S_{cb}: T = (\\chi, 0, 1)$ (Leg $c$ positive, $b$ negative, $a$ floating)\n\nA \"switching transition\" is any change in $T_x$ between consecutive states. A standard sequence to generate a fundamental AC voltage is $S_{ab} \\to S_{ac} \\to S_{bc} \\to S_{ba} \\to S_{ca} \\to S_{cb} \\to S_{ab}$. Let's count the transitions.\n\n1.  $S_{ab} \\to S_{ac}$: $(1, 0, \\chi) \\to (1, \\chi, 0)$.\n    -   $T_a$: $1 \\to 1$ (no change)\n    -   $T_b$: $0 \\to \\chi$ ($1$ transition)\n    -   $T_c$: $\\chi \\to 0$ ($1$ transition)\n    -   Total transitions = $2$.\n\n2.  $S_{ac} \\to S_{bc}$: $(1, \\chi, 0) \\to (\\chi, 1, 0)$.\n    -   $T_a$: $1 \\to \\chi$ ($1$ transition)\n    -   $T_b$: $\\chi \\to 1$ ($1$ transition)\n    -   $T_c$: $0 \\to 0$ (no change)\n    -   Total transitions = $2$.\n\nBy symmetry, every step in this sequence involves keeping one leg's connection unchanged while the other two change: one from active to floating, and one from floating to active. This results in exactly $2$ transitions at each of the $6$ steps.\n\n-   $S_{bc} \\to S_{ba}$: $d((\\chi, 1, 0), (0, 1, \\chi)) = 2$.\n-   $S_{ba} \\to S_{ca}$: $d((0, 1, \\chi), (0, \\chi, 1)) = 2$.\n-   $S_{ca} \\to S_{cb}$: $d((0, \\chi, 1), (\\chi, 0, 1)) = 2$.\n-   $S_{cb} \\to S_{ab}$: $d((\\chi, 0, 1), (1, 0, \\chi)) = 2$.\n\nThe total number of transitions for this sequence is $6 \\times 2 = 12$.\n\nTo confirm this is the minimum, we observe that the problem specifies that \"the conduction pair must change at every sector boundary\". This means the floating leg must change at each step. If leg $x$ was floating ($T_x=\\chi$) and leg $y$ becomes floating ($T_y=\\chi$), then $T_x$ must change from $\\chi$ to either $0$ or $1$, and $T_y$ must change from either $0$ or $1$ to $\\chi$. This guarantees at least two transitions at every step. Therefore, the minimum number of transitions per step is $2$, and the minimum total over a $6$-step cycle is $6 \\times 2 = 12$. The sequence analyzed above achieves this minimum.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. For $180^\\circ$ conduction, the minimal sequence is $V_1 \\to V_2 \\to V_3 \\to V_4 \\to V_5 \\to V_6 \\to V_1$, with exactly $6$ transitions per cycle; for $120^\\circ$ conduction, a minimal conduction-pair ordering such as $\\{ab\\}\\to\\{ac\\}\\to\\{cb\\}\\to\\{ca\\}\\to\\{ba\\}\\to\\{bc\\}\\to\\{ab\\}$ yields exactly $12$ transitions per cycle.**\n-   The statement for $180^\\circ$ conduction is entirely correct. The sequence is minimal, and the count is $6$.\n-   The statement for $120^\\circ$ conduction correctly identifies the minimal transition count as $12$. Although the specific example sequence provided is not a minimal-transition sequence, the main claim about the minimal count being $12$ is correct. Of the given choices, this is the most accurate.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. For $180^\\circ$ conduction, the minimal sequence must skip adjacent vectors, e.g., $V_1 \\to V_3 \\to V_5 \\to V_2 \\to V_4 \\to V_6 \\to V_1$, causing $12$ transitions per cycle; for $120^\\circ$ conduction, clamping one leg reduces transitions to $6$ per cycle.**\n-   The statement for $180^\\circ$ conduction is incorrect. Skipping vectors increases the transition count. The minimal count is $6$, not $12$.\n-   The statement for $120^\\circ$ conduction is incorrect. The minimal transition count is $12$, not $6$.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. For $180^\\circ$ conduction, the minimal adjacent sequence $V_1 \\to V_2 \\to \\cdots \\to V_6 \\to V_1$ has $6$ transitions per cycle; for $120^\\circ$ conduction, the minimal conduction-pair ordering also has $6$ transitions per cycle because the leg that remains energized does not switch.**\n-   The statement for $180^\\circ$ conduction is correct.\n-   The statement for $120^\\circ$ conduction is incorrect. The minimal count is $12$, not $6$. The reasoning is flawed; while one leg does not switch, two others must, resulting in $2$ transitions per step.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. For $180^\\circ$ conduction, a minimal sequence must include zero vectors, resulting in $8$ transitions per cycle; for $120^\\circ$ conduction, the floating leg increases the count to $16$ transitions per cycle.**\n-   The statement for $180^\\circ$ conduction is incorrect. The problem defines the sequence as a permutation of the six non-zero vectors. The six-step mode does not use zero vectors. The minimal count is $6$.\n-   The statement for $120^\\circ$ conduction is incorrect. The minimal transition count is $12$, not $16$.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the analysis, Option A is the only one that correctly identifies the minimal transition counts for both operating modes.",
