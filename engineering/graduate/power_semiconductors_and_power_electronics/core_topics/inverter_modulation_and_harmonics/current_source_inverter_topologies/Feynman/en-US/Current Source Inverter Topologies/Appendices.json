            "problem": "A three-phase, six-step Current Source Inverter (CSI) feeds a balanced three-phase load with sufficiently large inductance such that the direct current in the link is essentially constant at $I_{\\text{dc}}$. Each of the six identical reverse-blocking switches in the bridge has an on-state voltage-current characteristic given by $V_{\\text{on}}(I) = V_0 + r I$, where $V_0$ and $r$ are positive constants. The inverter transitions between line-current states every $\\pi/3$ electrical radians. At each transition, there is a symmetric commutation overlap of electrical angle $\\mu$ (in radians), during which the outgoing and incoming devices in the upper group both conduct and share the link current, and simultaneously the outgoing and incoming devices in the lower group both conduct and share the link current. Assume that during every commutation overlap, the current transfer in each group is linear with electrical angle: if $i(\\theta)$ denotes the current in the incoming device of the upper group, then over the overlap interval $i(\\theta)$ ramps linearly from $0$ to $I_{\\text{dc}}$, and the outgoing device carries $I_{\\text{dc}} - i(\\theta)$. The lower group behaves identically and synchronously, so that two parallel current paths exist during overlap, carrying $i(\\theta)$ and $I_{\\text{dc}} - i(\\theta)$, each path comprising exactly one upper and one lower switch in series. Outside the commutation overlaps, exactly one upper and one lower device conduct, each carrying the full link current $I_{\\text{dc}}$.\n\nStarting only from the definitions $p(t) = v(t) i(t)$ and the given $V_{\\text{on}}(I)$, and using the described conduction pattern, derive a closed-form expression for the average total conduction loss of the inverter over one electrical cycle, explicitly accounting for both the non-overlap conduction intervals and the commutation overlap intervals. Express your final answer as a single analytic expression in terms of $V_0$, $r$, $I_{\\text{dc}}$, and $\\mu$. Treat angles in radians and take the electrical cycle to be $2\\pi$. Express the final power in watts. Do not use any pre-tabulated or shortcut formulas. The final answer must be a single closed-form expression; no numerical rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and well-posed. The physical model, including the switch on-state characteristic and the description of the commutation process, is clearly defined and allows for a rigorous analytical solution. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the average total conduction loss, $P_{\\text{avg}}$, over one full electrical cycle of duration $2\\pi$ radians. The average power is the total energy dissipated during one cycle, $E_{\\text{total}}$, divided by the period of the cycle. In the angular domain, this is given by:\n$$P_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} p(\\theta) d\\theta$$\nwhere $p(\\theta)$ is the instantaneous total conduction loss of the inverter as a function of the electrical angle $\\theta$.\n\nThe instantaneous power loss in a single switch is $p_{\\text{switch}}(t) = V_{\\text{on}}(i(t)) \\cdot i(t)$. The switch on-state voltage is given as a linear function of the current $I$ through it:\n$$V_{\\text{on}}(I) = V_0 + rI$$\nwhere $V_0$ and $r$ are positive constants. Therefore, the instantaneous power loss in a single switch carrying current $I$ is:\n$$p_{\\text{switch}}(I) = (V_0 + rI)I = V_0 I + r I^2$$\n\nAn electrical cycle of $2\\pi$ radians consists of six steps. Transitions occur every $\\pi/3$ radians, leading to six commutation events per cycle. Each commutation involves an overlap period of electrical angle $\\mu$. The cycle can be divided into two types of intervals: non-overlap conduction intervals and commutation overlap intervals.\n\n1.  **Conduction Loss During Non-Overlap Intervals**\n\nDuring the non-overlap intervals, exactly two switches conduct: one in the upper group and one in the lower group. Each carries the full DC link current, $I_{\\text{dc}}$. The total instantaneous power loss during these intervals, $P_{\\text{no}}$, is the sum of the losses in these two switches:\n$$P_{\\text{no}} = 2 \\cdot p_{\\text{switch}}(I_{\\text{dc}}) = 2(V_0 I_{\\text{dc}} + r I_{\\text{dc}}^2)$$\nThere are six commutation intervals of duration $\\mu$ each in a full cycle of $2\\pi$. The total angle occupied by commutation is $6\\mu$. The total angle for non-overlap conduction is therefore $2\\pi - 6\\mu$.\n\nThe total energy dissipated during all non-overlap intervals, $E_{\\text{no}}$, is the instantaneous power multiplied by the total non-overlap angle:\n$$E_{\\text{no}} = P_{\\text{no}} \\cdot (2\\pi - 6\\mu) = (2V_0 I_{\\text{dc}} + 2r I_{\\text{dc}}^2)(2\\pi - 6\\mu)$$\n\n2.  **Conduction Loss During Commutation Overlap Intervals**\n\nDuring each commutation overlap of duration $\\mu$, four switches conduct. The problem states that two parallel current paths are formed. One path carries a current $i_1(\\phi)$ and the other carries a current $i_2(\\phi)$, where $\\phi$ is the electrical angle within the overlap interval, $0 \\le \\phi \\le \\mu$. Each path consists of one upper and one lower switch in series.\n\nThe current transfer is linear with angle. The incoming device current, which we denote as $i_1(\\phi)$, ramps from $0$ to $I_{\\text{dc}}$ over the angle $\\mu$:\n$$i_1(\\phi) = I_{\\text{dc}} \\frac{\\phi}{\\mu}$$\nThe outgoing device current, $i_2(\\phi)$, is given by $I_{\\text{dc}} - i_1(\\phi)$:\n$$i_2(\\phi) = I_{\\text{dc}} - I_{\\text{dc}} \\frac{\\phi}{\\mu} = I_{\\text{dc}}\\left(1 - \\frac{\\phi}{\\mu}\\right)$$\nNote that the total current from the DC source is $i_1(\\phi) + i_2(\\phi) = I_{\\text{dc}}$, consistent with the problem statement.\n\nThe instantaneous power loss during the overlap, $P_{\\text{o}}(\\phi)$, is the sum of losses in the four conducting switches. Path 1 has two series switches carrying $i_1(\\phi)$, and Path 2 has two series switches carrying $i_2(\\phi)$.\n$$P_{\\text{o}}(\\phi) = 2 \\cdot p_{\\text{switch}}(i_1(\\phi)) + 2 \\cdot p_{\\text{switch}}(i_2(\\phi))$$\n$$P_{\\text{o}}(\\phi) = 2(V_0 i_1(\\phi) + r i_1(\\phi)^2) + 2(V_0 i_2(\\phi) + r i_2(\\phi)^2)$$\n$$P_{\\text{o}}(\\phi) = 2V_0 (i_1(\\phi) + i_2(\\phi)) + 2r (i_1(\\phi)^2 + i_2(\\phi)^2)$$\nSubstituting $i_1(\\phi) + i_2(\\phi) = I_{\\text{dc}}$:\n$$P_{\\text{o}}(\\phi) = 2V_0 I_{\\text{dc}} + 2r \\left[ \\left(I_{\\text{dc}} \\frac{\\phi}{\\mu}\\right)^2 + \\left(I_{\\text{dc}}\\left(1 - \\frac{\\phi}{\\mu}\\right)\\right)^2 \\right]$$\n$$P_{\\text{o}}(\\phi) = 2V_0 I_{\\text{dc}} + 2r I_{\\text{dc}}^2 \\left[ \\frac{\\phi^2}{\\mu^2} + \\left(1 - \\frac{2\\phi}{\\mu} + \\frac{\\phi^2}{\\mu^2}\\right) \\right]$$\n$$P_{\\text{o}}(\\phi) = 2V_0 I_{\\text{dc}} + 2r I_{\\text{dc}}^2 \\left( 1 - \\frac{2\\phi}{\\mu} + \\frac{2\\phi^2}{\\mu^2} \\right)$$\nThe energy dissipated during one commutation interval, $E_{\\text{1o}}$, is the integral of $P_{\\text{o}}(\\phi)$ over the interval from $0$ to $\\mu$:\n$$E_{\\text{1o}} = \\int_{0}^{\\mu} P_{\\text{o}}(\\phi) d\\phi = \\int_{0}^{\\mu} \\left[ 2V_0 I_{\\text{dc}} + 2r I_{\\text{dc}}^2 \\left( 1 - \\frac{2\\phi}{\\mu} + \\frac{2\\phi^2}{\\mu^2} \\right) \\right] d\\phi$$\n$$E_{\\text{1o}} = \\left[ 2V_0 I_{\\text{dc}} \\phi \\right]_{0}^{\\mu} + 2r I_{\\text{dc}}^2 \\left[ \\phi - \\frac{\\phi^2}{\\mu} + \\frac{2\\phi^3}{3\\mu^2} \\right]_{0}^{\\mu}$$\n$$E_{\\text{1o}} = 2V_0 I_{\\text{dc}} \\mu + 2r I_{\\text{dc}}^2 \\left( \\mu - \\frac{\\mu^2}{\\mu} + \\frac{2\\mu^3}{3\\mu^2} \\right)$$\n$$E_{\\text{1o}} = 2V_0 I_{\\text{dc}} \\mu + 2r I_{\\text{dc}}^2 \\left( \\mu - \\mu + \\frac{2\\mu}{3} \\right) = 2V_0 I_{\\text{dc}} \\mu + \\frac{4}{3} r I_{\\text{dc}}^2 \\mu$$\nThere are six such commutation events in a cycle.

This provides the condition on $R_d$:\n\n$$\\frac{R_d}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{C_L}{L_s}} \\ge 1$$\n\nSolving for $R_d$, we obtain the required condition for a non-oscillatory response:\n\n$$R_d \\ge 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{L_s}{C_L}}$$\n\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we must compute the minimum value of $R_d$ that ensures a non-oscillatory response. This minimum occurs at the boundary between the underdamped (oscillatory) and overdamped (non-oscillatory) regimes, which is the critically damped case where $\\zeta = 1$.\n\n$$R_{d, \\text{min}} = R_{d, \\text{crit}} = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{L_s}{C_L}}$$\n\nWe are given the following parameter values:\n-   $L_s = 150\\,\\mu\\text{H} = 150 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{H}$\n-   $C_L = 2.0\\,\\text{nF} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{F}$\n\nThe value of $\\Delta I = 40\\,\\text{A}$ describes the magnitude of the excitation but is not needed to determine the condition for critical damping.\n\nFirst, we calculate the ratio $L_s/C_L$:\n\n$$\\frac{L_s}{C_L} = \\frac{150 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{H}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{F}} = 75 \\times 10^3\\,\\Omega^2 = 75000\\,\\Omega^2$$\n\nNext, we take the square root of this value. This quantity is known as the characteristic impedance of the LC circuit.\n\n$$\\sqrt{\\frac{L_s}{C_L}} = \\sqrt{75000}\\,\\Omega \\approx 273.861\\,\\Omega$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the minimum required damping resistance:\n\n$$R_{d, \\text{min}} = 2 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{L_s}{C_L}} \\approx 2 \\times 273.861\\,\\Omega \\approx 547.722\\,\\Omega$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the answer to three significant figures.\n\n$$R_{d, \\text{min}} \\approx 548\\,\\Omega$$",
