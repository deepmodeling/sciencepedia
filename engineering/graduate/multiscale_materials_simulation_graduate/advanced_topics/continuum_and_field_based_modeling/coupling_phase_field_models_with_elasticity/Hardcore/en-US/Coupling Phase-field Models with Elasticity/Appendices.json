A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to find the stress field $\\sigma(x)$ and the total elastic energy $\\Psi[\\epsilon^{0}]$.\n\nThe mechanical equilibrium equation in one dimension without body forces is given as:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{dx} = 0\n$$\nIntegrating this equation with respect to $x$ shows that the stress field $\\sigma(x)$ must be spatially uniform, i.e., constant. Let us denote this constant stress by $\\sigma_c$:\n$$\n\\sigma(x) = \\sigma_c\n$$\nTo determine the value of this constant $\\sigma_c$, we must use the constitutive relations and the displacement boundary conditions. The one-dimensional Hooke's law is given by:\n$$\n\\sigma(x) = E \\, \\epsilon^{e}(x)\n$$\nSince $\\sigma(x)$ is constant, the elastic strain $\\epsilon^{e}(x)$ must also be constant:\n$$\n\\epsilon^{e}(x) = \\frac{\\sigma_c}{E}\n$$\nThe elastic strain is defined in terms of the total strain $\\epsilon(x)$ and the eigenstrain $\\epsilon^{0}(x)$:\n$$\n\\epsilon^{e}(x) = \\epsilon(x) - \\epsilon^{0}(x)\n$$\nBy rearranging, we express the total strain in terms of the constant stress and the prescribed eigenstrain field:\n$$\n\\epsilon(x) = \\epsilon^{e}(x) + \\epsilon^{0}(x) = \\frac{\\sigma_c}{E} + \\epsilon^{0}(x)\n$$\nThe total strain is the spatial derivative of the displacement field, $\\epsilon(x) = \\frac{du}{dx}$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dx} = \\frac{\\sigma_c}{E} + \\epsilon^{0}(x)\n$$\nWe can find the displacement field $u(x)$ by integrating this expression from $0$ to $x$. Let $z$ be the dummy variable of integration.\n$$\nu(x) - u(0) = \\int_{0}^{x} \\frac{du}{dz} \\, dz = \\int_{0}^{x} \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_c}{E} + \\epsilon^{0}(z) \\right) \\, dz\n$$\nUsing the first boundary condition, $u(0) = 0$, we have:\n$$\nu(x) = \\frac{\\sigma_c}{E} x + \\int_{0}^{x} \\epsilon^{0}(z) \\, dz\n$$\nNow, we apply the second boundary condition, $u(L) = \\Delta$:\n$$\nu(L) = \\Delta = \\frac{\\sigma_c}{E} L + \\int_{0}^{L} \\epsilon^{0}(z) \\, dz\n$$\nThis equation allows us to solve for the unknown constant stress $\\sigma_c$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sigma_c L}{E} = \\Delta - \\int_{0}^{L} \\epsilon^{0}(z) \\, dz\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_c = \\frac{E}{L} \\left( \\Delta - \\int_{0}^{L} \\epsilon^{0}(z) \\, dz \\right)\n$$\nSince $\\sigma(x) = \\sigma_c$, this is the expression for the stress field.\n\nNext, we compute the total elastic energy $\\Psi[\\epsilon^{0}]$.

The integrand is therefore also constant.\n$$\n\\Psi[\\epsilon^{0}] = \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{1}{2} E A \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_c}{E} \\right)^{2} \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{A \\sigma_c^2}{2 E} \\, dx\n$$\nEvaluating the integral of a constant over the interval $[0, L]$ yields:\n$$\n\\Psi[\\epsilon^{0}] = \\frac{A \\sigma_c^2}{2 E} \\int_{0}^{L} dx = \\frac{A L \\sigma_c^2}{2 E}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute the derived expression for $\\sigma_c$ into the energy equation:\n$$\n\\Psi[\\epsilon^{0}] = \\frac{A L}{2 E} \\left[ \\frac{E}{L} \\left( \\Delta - \\int_{0}^{L} \\epsilon^{0}(z) \\, dz \\right) \\right]^2\n$$\n$$\n\\Psi[\\epsilon^{0}] = \\frac{A L}{2 E} \\frac{E^2}{L^2} \\left( \\Delta - \\int_{0}^{L} \\epsilon^{0}(z) \\, dz \\right)^2\n$$\nSimplifying the prefactors gives the final closed-form expression for the total elastic energy:\n$$\n\\Psi[\\epsilon^{0}] = \\frac{A E}{2 L} \\left( \\Delta - \\int_{0}^{L} \\epsilon^{0}(z) \\, dz \\right)^2\n$$\nThe problem requires the derivation of both the stress field $\\sigma(x)$ and the energy functional $\\Psi[\\epsilon^{0}]$.

The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\n\nThe problem concerns solving the equations of linear elasticity for a heterogeneous eigenstrain field $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0(\\mathbf{x})$ in a domain with periodic boundary conditions. The material has a homogeneous elastic stiffness tensor $\\mathsf{C}$.\n\nThe governing equations in real space are:\n1.  **Mechanical Equilibrium**: $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{0}$ (for zero body forces). In index notation, $\\sigma_{ij,j}(\\mathbf{x}) = 0$.\n2.  **Constitutive Law (Hooke's Law)**: $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathsf{C} : (\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}(\\mathbf{x}) - \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0(\\mathbf{x}))$. In index notation, $\\sigma_{ij}(\\mathbf{x}) = C_{ijkl}(\\epsilon_{kl}(\\mathbf{x}) - \\epsilon^0_{kl}(\\mathbf{x}))$.\n3.  **Kinematic Compatibility**: The total strain $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}(\\mathbf{x})$ must be derivable from a displacement field $\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x})$, i.e., $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}) + (\\nabla\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}))^T)$. In index notation, $\\epsilon_{ij}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{1}{2}(u_{i,j}(\\mathbf{x}) + u_{j,i}(\\mathbf{x}))$.\n\nIn real space, this is a system of coupled partial differential equations (PDEs). Solving it with mesh-based methods like the Finite Element Method (FEM) involves discretizing the domain and solving a large system of linear equations of the form $\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{d}=\\mathbf{F}$, where $\\mathbf{K}$ is the global stiffness matrix.\n\nThe FFT-based spectral method offers a significant computational advantage for periodic domains with homogeneous $\\mathsf{C}$. The method transforms the equations into Fourier space. Let $\\hat{f}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\mathcal{F}[f(\\mathbf{x})]$ denote the Fourier transform. The spatial derivative operator $\\nabla$ becomes multiplication by $i\\mathbf{k}$, where $\\mathbf{k}$ is the wavevector.\n\nThe governing equations in Fourier space for each wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$ are:\n1.  **Equilibrium**: $i k_j \\hat{\\sigma}_{ij}(\\mathbf{k}) = 0$.\n2.  **Constitutive Law**: $\\hat{\\sigma}_{ij}(\\mathbf{k}) = C_{ijkl}(\\hat{\\epsilon}_{kl}(\\mathbf{k}) - \\hat{\\epsilon}^0_{kl}(\\mathbf{k}))$. This is a direct transform because $\\mathsf{C}$ is homogeneous (constant in space).\n3.  **Compatibility**: $\\hat{\\epsilon}_{ij}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{i}{2}(k_j \\hat{u}_i(\\mathbf{k}) + k_i \\hat{u}_j(\\mathbf{k}))$.\n\nFor any non-zero wavevector, $\\mathbf{k} \\neq \\mathbf{0}$, we can combine these equations to solve for the unknown fields. Substituting the constitutive and compatibility relations into the equilibrium equation yields:\n$k_j C_{ijkl} \\left( \\frac{i}{2}(k_l \\hat{u}_k(\\mathbf{k}) + k_k \\hat{u}_l(\\mathbf{k})) \\right) = k_j C_{ijkl} \\hat{\\epsilon}^0_{kl}(\\mathbf{k})$.\n$- (C_{ikjl} k_j k_l) \\hat{u}_k(\\mathbf{k}) = i k_j C_{ijkl} \\hat{\\epsilon}^0_{kl}(\\mathbf{k})$.\nThe term in parentheses on the left is the acoustic or Christoffel tensor, $N_{ik}(\\mathbf{k}) = C_{iljk} k_j k_l$. Thus, we have a small (e.g., $3 \\times 3$ in 3D) linear algebraic system for the displacement amplitudes $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}(\\mathbf{k})$ for each $\\mathbf{k}$:\n$N_{ik}(\\mathbf{k}) \\hat{u}_k(\\mathbf{k}) = -i k_j C_{ijkl} \\hat{\\epsilon}^0_{kl}(\\mathbf{k})$.\n\nBy inverting $\\mathsf{N}(\\mathbf{k})$, one can solve for $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}(\\mathbf{k})$, then find $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}(\\mathbf{k})$ and $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}(\\mathbf{k})$. More directly, this procedure establishes a linear relationship between the compatible strain $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}(\\mathbf{k})$ and the given eigenstrain $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}^0(\\mathbf{k})$, which can be expressed via a pre-computable fourth-rank tensor Green's operator $\\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{k})$ such that $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{k}):\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}^0(\\mathbf{k})$. The stress is then $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\mathsf{C}:(\\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{k})-\\mathbf{I}):\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}^0(\\mathbf{k})$, where $\\mathbf{I}$ is the fourth-rank identity tensor. This must be done for each $\\mathbf{k} \\neq \\mathbf{0}$.\n\nThe $\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{0}$ mode corresponds to the volume average of the fields: $\\hat{f}(\\mathbf{0}) = \\langle f \\rangle$. The equilibrium equation $i k_j \\hat{\\sigma}_{ij} = 0$ is trivially satisfied for $\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{0}$. The constitutive relation becomes $\\langle\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\rangle = \\mathsf{C}:(\\langle\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\\rangle - \\langle\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0\\rangle)$. This equation is handled by imposing a macroscopic constraint, such as fixed average strain ($\\langle\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\\rangle = \\text{constant}$) or fixed average stress ($\\langle\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\rangle = \\text{constant}$, often $\\mathbf{0}$).\n\n**Computational Advantage**: The main computational cost is performing FFTs on the gridded fields (e.g., $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0(\\mathbf{x})$) to get their Fourier representations ($\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}^0(\\mathbf{k})$) and inverse FFTs to get the solution fields ($\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{x})$, $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}(\\mathbf{x})$) back in real space. For a grid with $N$ points, the FFT algorithm has a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$. The operations in Fourier space are pointwise multiplications for each $\\mathbf{k}$, which is an $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ operation overall. Therefore, the total complexity of the elastic solve per iteration is $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$. This is significantly more efficient than standard real-space solvers.\n\n**Computation of `F_el` and `μ_el`**:\n- **Elastic Energy, $F_{\\text{el}}$**: The total elastic energy is the integral of the elastic energy density:\n$$F_{\\text{el}} = \\int_{\\Omega} W_{\\text{el}}(\\mathbf{x}) \\, \\mathrm{d}V = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\Omega} (\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}(\\mathbf{x}) - \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0(\\mathbf{x})) : \\mathsf{C} : (\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}(\\mathbf{x}) - \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0(\\mathbf{x})) \\, \\mathrm{d}V$$\nUsing Parseval's theorem, this can be efficiently computed in Fourier space, often using a form like:\n$$F_{\\text{el}} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\Omega} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{x}) : \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0(\\mathbf{x}) \\, \\mathrm{d}V + \\text{boundary terms}$$\nFor periodic systems under zero average stress, this simplifies to a summation over Fourier modes:\n$$F_{\\text{el}} = -\\frac{V_{cell}}{2} \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} \\hat{\\sigma}_{ij}^*(\\mathbf{k}) \\hat{\\epsilon}^0_{ij}(\\mathbf{k})$$\n- **Elastic Chemical Potential, $\\mu_{\\text{el}}$**: The total free energy functional is $F[\\phi] = \\int_{\\Omega} [f_{\\text{chem}}(\\phi) + \\frac{\\kappa}{2}|\\nabla\\phi|^2 + W_{\\text{el}}(\\phi)] \\, \\mathrm{d}V$. The chemical potential is its variational derivative, $\\mu = \\delta F / \\delta \\phi$. The elastic contribution is $\\mu_{\\text{el}} = \\delta F_{\\text{el}} / \\delta \\phi$.\n$$\\delta F_{\\text{el}} = \\delta \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\Omega} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}:(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}-\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0) \\, \\mathrm{d}V \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\Omega} \\left[ \\delta\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}:(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}-\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0) + \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}:(\\delta\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}-\\delta\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0) \\right] \\, \\mathrm{d}V$$\nSince $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathsf{C}:(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}-\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0)$, the two terms in the integrand are identical. Using integration by parts and the equilibrium condition $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathbf{0}$, the term $\\int \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}:\\delta\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} \\, \\mathrm{d}V = 0$. The variation $\\delta \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0$ comes from the change in $\\phi$: $\\delta\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0 = (\\partial\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0 / \\partial\\phi) \\delta\\phi$. This leads to:\n$$\\delta F_{\\text{el}} = \\int_{\\Omega} \\left( -\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\frac{\\partial\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0}{\\partial\\phi} \\right) \\delta\\phi \\, \\mathrm{d}V$$\nBy definition of the variational derivative, we identify the term in the parenthesis as $\\mu_{\\text{el}}(\\mathbf{x})$. This holds provided $\\mathsf{C}$ is independent of $\\phi$.\n$$\\mu_{\\text{el}}(\\mathbf{x}) = -\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{x}) : \\frac{\\partial\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0(\\phi)}{\\partial\\phi}$$\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In a periodic domain with homogeneous $\\mathsf{C}$, the FFT-based approach reduces the per-iteration complexity of the elastic solve to $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$ by diagonalizing convolutions; the Fourier modes $\\mathbf{k}\\neq \\mathbf{0}$ decouple and are solved via small algebraic systems, enabling efficient updates of $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{k})$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}(\\mathbf{k})$.**\nThis statement accurately summarizes the key features and advantages of the FFT-based method. The transformation to Fourier space turns the convolution inherent in solving the elastic PDEs into simple pointwise multiplication, effectively \"diagonalizing\" the operator in the Fourier basis. This leads to the decoupling of Fourier modes, where each mode can be solved independently. The resulting computational complexity is dominated by the FFTs, which is $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$ for $N$ grid points.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. For homogeneous $\\mathsf{C}$, one computes $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{k})$ for $\\mathbf{k}\\neq \\mathbf{0}$ by applying a precomputed elastic Green operator $\\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{k})$ to $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0(\\mathbf{k})$, i.e., $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{k})=-\\mathsf{C}:\\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{k}):\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0(\\mathbf{k})$, handles the $\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{0}$ mode according to the imposed macroscopic constraint (e.g., fixed average strain or zero average stress), and obtains real-space fields by inverse FFT; the elastic energy is then computed as $F_{\\text{el}}=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\int_{\\Omega}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}-\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0):\\mathsf{C}:(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}-\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0)\\,\\mathrm{d}V$.**\nThis statement describes the procedure correctly. The relationship between stress and eigenstrain in Fourier space is linear and can be expressed via an operator, as shown. The form $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{k}) \\propto -\\mathsf{C}:\\mathbf{G}:\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0(\\mathbf{k})$ is a valid representation (though different conventions for $\\mathbf{G}$ exist). The handling of the $\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{0}$ mode and the use of inverse FFT are also described correctly. Finally, the expression for $F_{\\text{el}}$ is the fundamental, correct definition of elastic strain energy. While more efficient Fourier-space formulas exist for its computation, this definition is undeniably correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. The elastic contribution to the chemical potential is $\\mu_{\\text{el}}(\\mathbf{x})=-\\nabla\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{x})$, because mechanical equilibrium implies $\\nabla\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}=\\mathbf{0}$ and thus the divergence directly determines $\\mu_{\\text{el}}$.**\nThis statement is incorrect and contains a logical fallacy. The premise states that mechanical equilibrium implies $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathbf{0}$. The statement then claims $\\mu_{\\text{el}}(\\mathbf{x}) = -\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{x})$, which would mean $\\mu_{\\text{el}}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{0}$ everywhere. This is physically wrong; the elastic chemical potential is a primary driving force for microstructure evolution and is generally non-zero.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. If the coupling to elasticity enters only through $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0(\\phi)$ and $\\mathsf{C}$ is independent of $\\phi$, then the elastic contribution to the chemical potential is given by $\\mu_{\\text{el}}(\\mathbf{x})=-\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{x}):\\partial\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0/\\partial\\phi$.**\nThis is the correct formula for the elastic part of the chemical potential under the specified assumptions. As derived above from the variational derivative of the elastic free energy, $\\mu_{\\text{el}} = \\delta F_{\\text{el}} / \\delta\\phi$. The conditions mentioned in the option are precisely those used in the derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**E. The principal computational advantage of the FFT-based microelasticity method arises from assembling and inverting a dense finite element stiffness matrix at every iteration, which is particularly efficient for periodic boundary conditions.**\nThis statement fundamentally misrepresents the method. The FFT-based method's advantage lies in *avoiding* the assembly and inversion of any large stiffness matrix, be it sparse (as in FEM) or dense. It bypasses this expensive step entirely by working in Fourier space.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**F. In Fourier space, for each $\\mathbf{k}\\neq \\mathbf{0}$ one solves an algebraic system involving the acoustic (Christoffel) tensor $\\mathsf{N}(\\mathbf{k})$ with components $N_{lp}(\\mathbf{k})=C_{lpmn}k_m k_n$ to obtain a projection operator that maps $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0(\\mathbf{k})$ onto the compatible elastic strain $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}(\\mathbf{k})$; this mode-wise decoupling turns the convolution into pointwise multiplication in $\\mathbf{k}$-space.**\nThis statement provides a correct and detailed description of the mathematical underpinnings of the FFT method. The equilibrium equation in Fourier space leads to a system involving the Christoffel tensor $\\mathsf{N}(\\mathbf{k})$. Inverting this tensor (for each $\\mathbf{k}$) allows one to construct the operator that relates the compatible strain $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}(\\mathbf{k})$ to the source eigenstrain $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}^0(\\mathbf{k})$. This mode-wise operation is the essence of why the method is efficient, transforming a real-space convolution into a real-space multiplication.\n**Verdict: Correct**",

In particular, consider the case where $\\mathbb{C}(\\phi)$ varies sharply but smoothly across diffuse interfaces of characteristic width $\\ell$, and note that multiplication by spatially varying coefficients in physical space corresponds to convolution in spectral space.\n\nWhich of the following statements about accuracy trade-offs are correct?\n\nA. On a periodic rectangular domain with constant stiffness $\\mathbb{C}(\\phi)\\equiv \\mathbb{C}_0$, the Fourier spectral approach diagonalizes the linear elastic operator in the frequency domain, leading to spectrally accurate solutions and rapid convergence of the computed elastic energy for smooth loads, whereas FEM converges algebraically with mesh refinement; thus, for the same number of degrees of freedom, the spectral method typically achieves higher accuracy in energy in this constant-coefficient periodic setting.\n\nB. When $\\mathbb{C}(\\phi)$ has sharp spatial variation across diffuse interfaces of width $\\ell$, truncated Fourier representations can exhibit Gibbs phenomena and aliasing in $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{u})$ unless the grid spacing $h$ satisfies $h \\ll \\ell$ and appropriate dealiasing is used; FEM can reduce such oscillations by aligning the mesh with regions of large gradients and using suitable quadrature, improving accuracy of the elastic energy near interfaces.\n\nC. For complex non-periodic mixed boundary conditions on non-rectangular domains, embedding the domain into a periodic box and enforcing boundary conditions via penalization or masking in the spectral method preserves the accuracy of the elastic energy more robustly than FEM, which suffers from a “variational crime” that significantly degrades energy accuracy relative to spectral embedding.\n\nD. In a coupled phase-field evolution, the elastic driving force $\\delta E/\\delta \\phi = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{u}) : \\left(\\tfrac{\\partial \\mathbb{C}}{\\partial \\phi}\\right) : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{u})$ depends sensitively on $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{u})$; for heterogeneous stiffness, errors in $\\mathbf{u}$ due to non-diagonal operators in Fourier space can introduce spurious oscillations in $\\delta E/\\delta \\phi$, whereas FEM with consistent linearization of the $\\phi$-dependence and appropriate quadrature can yield more accurate driving forces.\n\nE. In pseudo-spectral implementations, treating the spatially varying stiffness by multiplying in physical space and transforming strains via FFT keeps the elastic operator effectively diagonal in Fourier space, so the accuracy of energy computations remains essentially the same as in the constant-coefficient case even for strongly heterogeneous $\\mathbb{C}(\\phi)$.",

A solution will be derived by analyzing each option based on the principles of numerical analysis for partial differential equations.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe core of the problem lies in comparing a global method (spectral) with a local one (FEM) for solving the linear elasticity equation $\\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbb{C}(\\phi) : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{u})) = \\mathbf{0}$ where the coefficient tensor $\\mathbb{C}$ is spatially heterogeneous.\n\n**Option A Evaluation:**\nThis option considers the idealized case of a periodic rectangular domain and a constant stiffness tensor, $\\mathbb{C}(\\phi) \\equiv \\mathbb{C}_0$. The governing equation becomes $\\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbb{C}_0 : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{u})) = \\mathbf{0}$. In a Fourier spectral method, differentiation in physical space becomes multiplication by $i\\mathbf{k}$ in Fourier space, where $\\mathbf{k}$ is the wavevector. Because $\\mathbb{C}_0$ is constant, the entire linear differential operator becomes a simple algebraic tensor multiplication in the Fourier domain for each wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$. This diagonalizes the operator in the basis of Fourier modes. For smooth solutions (e.g., resulting from smooth loading), the Fourier coefficients decay rapidly, leading to \"spectral accuracy,\" meaning the error decreases faster than any polynomial in the number of degrees of freedom. In contrast, the Finite Element Method uses local polynomial basis functions, leading to an algebraic rate of convergence, where the error is proportional to $h^p$ for mesh size $h$ and polynomial order $p$. For a given number of degrees of freedom, the spectral method will achieve far higher accuracy than FEM in this specific, idealized scenario. The statement accurately reflects these well-known properties.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option B Evaluation:**\nThis option addresses the more realistic case where $\\mathbb{C}(\\phi)$ varies sharply across interfaces. A sharp but smooth variation in $\\mathbb{C}(\\phi)$ over a length scale $\\ell$ means its representation in Fourier space has significant high-frequency content. When solving the elasticity equation, the solution $\\mathbf{u}$ will also exhibit variations on a similar length scale. A truncated Fourier series for such a function will exhibit Gibbs oscillations near the sharp features. Furthermore, in a pseudo-spectral method, the product $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathbb{C}(\\phi) : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{u})$ is computed in physical space. If the Fourier series for $\\mathbb{C}(\\phi)$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{u})$ are truncated at a maximum wave number $N$, their product can contain frequencies up to $2N$. If the grid cannot resolve these higher frequencies, they are incorrectly represented as lower frequencies, an error known as aliasing. To mitigate this, the grid spacing $h$ must be small enough to resolve the interface ($h \\ll \\ell$) and techniques like padding and cropping (the \"2/3 rule\") must be used for dealiasing. FEM, by contrast, handles spatial heterogeneity naturally. A finite element mesh can be refined locally in the regions of high gradients (i.e., near the interface where $\\phi$ changes) to accurately capture the solution's behavior without global oscillations. This local adaptivity is a principal advantage of FEM for such problems. The statement correctly identifies these phenomena.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option C Evaluation:**\nThis option claims that for complex, non-rectangular domains and non-periodic boundary conditions, spectral methods are more robust than FEM. This is factually incorrect. The primary strength of FEM is its geometric flexibility. It can naturally handle arbitrarily complex domains and boundary conditions (both essential/Dirichlet and natural/Neumann) through the variational formulation on a body-fitted mesh. Conversely, Fourier spectral methods are fundamentally designed for periodic boundary conditions on rectangular domains. Applying them to non-periodic, complex domains requires techniques like embedding the domain in a larger periodic box and enforcing the boundary conditions artificially, for instance, via a penalty method or a Lagrange multiplier field. These techniques are often complex to implement, can be computationally expensive, and frequently degrade the method's accuracy, particularly near the boundary, thereby failing to preserve the high accuracy of the underlying spectral approximation. The claim that FEM suffers from a \"variational crime\" that makes it *less* accurate than spectral embedding in this context is a reversal of the known strengths and weaknesses of the two methods.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option D Evaluation:**\nThis option focuses on the accuracy of the phase-field driving force, $\\delta E/\\delta \\phi$, which includes the term $\\tfrac{1}{2}\\,\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{u}) : (\\tfrac{\\partial \\mathbb{C}}{\\partial \\phi}) : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{u})$. This term is non-zero only within the diffuse interface where $\\partial \\mathbb{C}/\\partial \\phi$ is non-zero. Its accuracy depends critically on the local accuracy of the strain field $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{u})$. As discussed for Option B, when $\\mathbb{C}(\\phi)$ is heterogeneous, solving for $\\mathbf{u}$ with a spectral method can introduce spurious Gibbs oscillations into the solution and its gradient, $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{u})$. These errors are particularly pronounced near the interface. Since the driving force term depends quadratically on the strain, these oscillations can be amplified, resulting in a highly inaccurate and oscillatory driving force. This can lead to unphysical simulation artifacts, such as the artificial pinning of the interface. FEM, especially with mesh refinement near the interface, can compute a much smoother and more accurate local strain field. When the discrete energy functional is differentiated consistently to obtain the discrete driving forces, FEM provides a more robust and physically meaningful result for the phase-field evolution. The statement correctly identifies this critical issue.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option E Evaluation:**\nThis option describes a pseudo-spectral method, where multiplications are done in physical space and derivatives (via FFT) in Fourier space. It incorrectly claims that this procedure keeps the elastic operator \"effectively diagonal\" and maintains the accuracy of the constant-coefficient case. The operator for heterogeneous elasticity is $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{u}) = \\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbb{C}(\\mathbf{x}) : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{u}))$. In Fourier space, this becomes a convolution. Let $\\widehat{\\cdot}$ denote the Fourier transform. Then $\\widehat{\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{u})} \\neq \\mathbf{L}(\\mathbf{k}) \\widehat{\\mathbf{u}}(\\mathbf{k})$ for some simple tensor $\\mathbf{L}(\\mathbf{k})$. Instead, $\\widehat{\\mathbb{C} : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}} = \\widehat{\\mathbb{C}} * \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}$, where $*$ denotes convolution. This convolution couples all Fourier modes, meaning the operator matrix in the Fourier basis is dense, not diagonal. This coupling is the mathematical origin of the loss of simple efficiency and accuracy compared to the constant-coefficient case. The accuracy of the solution degrades from spectral to algebraic, depending on the smoothness of the coefficients. The statement that the operator remains \"effectively diagonal\" is a fundamental misunderstanding of pseudo-spectral methods for variable-coefficient problems.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",
