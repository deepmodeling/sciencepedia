The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\n\nThe problem concerns solving the equations of linear elasticity for a heterogeneous eigenstrain field $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0(\\mathbf{x})$ in a domain with periodic boundary conditions. The material has a homogeneous elastic stiffness tensor $\\mathsf{C}$.\n\nThe governing equations in real space are:\n1.  **Mechanical Equilibrium**: $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{0}$ (for zero body forces). In index notation, $\\sigma_{ij,j}(\\mathbf{x}) = 0$.\n2.  **Constitutive Law (Hooke's Law)**: $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathsf{C} : (\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}(\\mathbf{x}) - \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0(\\mathbf{x}))$. In index notation, $\\sigma_{ij}(\\mathbf{x}) = C_{ijkl}(\\epsilon_{kl}(\\mathbf{x}) - \\epsilon^0_{kl}(\\mathbf{x}))$.\n3.  **Kinematic Compatibility**: The total strain $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}(\\mathbf{x})$ must be derivable from a displacement field $\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x})$, i.e., $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}) + (\\nabla\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}))^T)$. In index notation, $\\epsilon_{ij}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{1}{2}(u_{i,j}(\\mathbf{x}) + u_{j,i}(\\mathbf{x}))$.\n\nIn real space, this is a system of coupled partial differential equations (PDEs). Solving it with mesh-based methods like the Finite Element Method (FEM) involves discretizing the domain and solving a large system of linear equations of the form $\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{d}=\\mathbf{F}$, where $\\mathbf{K}$ is the global stiffness matrix.\n\nThe FFT-based spectral method offers a significant computational advantage for periodic domains with homogeneous $\\mathsf{C}$. The method transforms the equations into Fourier space. Let $\\hat{f}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\mathcal{F}[f(\\mathbf{x})]$ denote the Fourier transform. The spatial derivative operator $\\nabla$ becomes multiplication by $i\\mathbf{k}$, where $\\mathbf{k}$ is the wavevector.\n\nThe governing equations in Fourier space for each wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$ are:\n1.  **Equilibrium**: $i k_j \\hat{\\sigma}_{ij}(\\mathbf{k}) = 0$.\n2.  **Constitutive Law**: $\\hat{\\sigma}_{ij}(\\mathbf{k}) = C_{ijkl}(\\hat{\\epsilon}_{kl}(\\mathbf{k}) - \\hat{\\epsilon}^0_{kl}(\\mathbf{k}))$. This is a direct transform because $\\mathsf{C}$ is homogeneous (constant in space).\n3.  **Compatibility**: $\\hat{\\epsilon}_{ij}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{i}{2}(k_j \\hat{u}_i(\\mathbf{k}) + k_i \\hat{u}_j(\\mathbf{k}))$.\n\nFor any non-zero wavevector, $\\mathbf{k} \\neq \\mathbf{0}$, we can combine these equations to solve for the unknown fields. Substituting the constitutive and compatibility relations into the equilibrium equation yields:\n$k_j C_{ijkl} \\left( \\frac{i}{2}(k_l \\hat{u}_k(\\mathbf{k}) + k_k \\hat{u}_l(\\mathbf{k})) \\right) = k_j C_{ijkl} \\hat{\\epsilon}^0_{kl}(\\mathbf{k})$.\n$- (C_{ikjl} k_j k_l) \\hat{u}_k(\\mathbf{k}) = i k_j C_{ijkl} \\hat{\\epsilon}^0_{kl}(\\mathbf{k})$.\nThe term in parentheses on the left is the acoustic or Christoffel tensor, $N_{ik}(\\mathbf{k}) = C_{iljk} k_j k_l$. Thus, we have a small (e.g., $3 \\times 3$ in 3D) linear algebraic system for the displacement amplitudes $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}(\\mathbf{k})$ for each $\\mathbf{k}$:\n$N_{ik}(\\mathbf{k}) \\hat{u}_k(\\mathbf{k}) = -i k_j C_{ijkl} \\hat{\\epsilon}^0_{kl}(\\mathbf{k})$.\n\nBy inverting $\\mathsf{N}(\\mathbf{k})$, one can solve for $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}(\\mathbf{k})$, then find $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}(\\mathbf{k})$ and $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}(\\mathbf{k})$. More directly, this procedure establishes a linear relationship between the compatible strain $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}(\\mathbf{k})$ and the given eigenstrain $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}^0(\\mathbf{k})$, which can be expressed via a pre-computable fourth-rank tensor Green's operator $\\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{k})$ such that $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{k}):\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}^0(\\mathbf{k})$. The stress is then $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\mathsf{C}:(\\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{k})-\\mathbf{I}):\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}^0(\\mathbf{k})$, where $\\mathbf{I}$ is the fourth-rank identity tensor. This must be done for each $\\mathbf{k} \\neq \\mathbf{0}$.\n\nThe $\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{0}$ mode corresponds to the volume average of the fields: $\\hat{f}(\\mathbf{0}) = \\langle f \\rangle$. The equilibrium equation $i k_j \\hat{\\sigma}_{ij} = 0$ is trivially satisfied for $\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{0}$. The constitutive relation becomes $\\langle\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\rangle = \\mathsf{C}:(\\langle\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\\rangle - \\langle\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0\\rangle)$. This equation is handled by imposing a macroscopic constraint, such as fixed average strain ($\\langle\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\\rangle = \\text{constant}$) or fixed average stress ($\\langle\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\rangle = \\text{constant}$, often $\\mathbf{0}$).\n\n**Computational Advantage**: The main computational cost is performing FFTs on the gridded fields (e.g., $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0(\\mathbf{x})$) to get their Fourier representations ($\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}^0(\\mathbf{k})$) and inverse FFTs to get the solution fields ($\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{x})$, $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}(\\mathbf{x})$) back in real space. For a grid with $N$ points, the FFT algorithm has a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$. The operations in Fourier space are pointwise multiplications for each $\\mathbf{k}$, which is an $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ operation overall. Therefore, the total complexity of the elastic solve per iteration is $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$. This is significantly more efficient than standard real-space solvers.\n\n**Computation of `F_el` and `μ_el`**:\n- **Elastic Energy, $F_{\\text{el}}$**: The total elastic energy is the integral of the elastic energy density:\n$$F_{\\text{el}} = \\int_{\\Omega} W_{\\text{el}}(\\mathbf{x}) \\, \\mathrm{d}V = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\Omega} (\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}(\\mathbf{x}) - \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0(\\mathbf{x})) : \\mathsf{C} : (\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}(\\mathbf{x}) - \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0(\\mathbf{x})) \\, \\mathrm{d}V$$\nUsing Parseval's theorem, this can be efficiently computed in Fourier space, often using a form like:\n$$F_{\\text{el}} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\Omega} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{x}) : \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0(\\mathbf{x}) \\, \\mathrm{d}V + \\text{boundary terms}$$\nFor periodic systems under zero average stress, this simplifies to a summation over Fourier modes:\n$$F_{\\text{el}} = -\\frac{V_{cell}}{2} \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} \\hat{\\sigma}_{ij}^*(\\mathbf{k}) \\hat{\\epsilon}^0_{ij}(\\mathbf{k})$$\n- **Elastic Chemical Potential, $\\mu_{\\text{el}}$**: The total free energy functional is $F[\\phi] = \\int_{\\Omega} [f_{\\text{chem}}(\\phi) + \\frac{\\kappa}{2}|\\nabla\\phi|^2 + W_{\\text{el}}(\\phi)] \\, \\mathrm{d}V$. The chemical potential is its variational derivative, $\\mu = \\delta F / \\delta \\phi$. The elastic contribution is $\\mu_{\\text{el}} = \\delta F_{\\text{el}} / \\delta \\phi$.\n$$\\delta F_{\\text{el}} = \\delta \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\Omega} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}:(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}-\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0) \\, \\mathrm{d}V \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\Omega} \\left[ \\delta\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}:(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}-\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0) + \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}:(\\delta\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}-\\delta\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0) \\right] \\, \\mathrm{d}V$$\nSince $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathsf{C}:(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}-\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0)$, the two terms in the integrand are identical. Using integration by parts and the equilibrium condition $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathbf{0}$, the term $\\int \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}:\\delta\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} \\, \\mathrm{d}V = 0$. The variation $\\delta \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0$ comes from the change in $\\phi$: $\\delta\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0 = (\\partial\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0 / \\partial\\phi) \\delta\\phi$. This leads to:\n$$\\delta F_{\\text{el}} = \\int_{\\Omega} \\left( -\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\frac{\\partial\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0}{\\partial\\phi} \\right) \\delta\\phi \\, \\mathrm{d}V$$\nBy definition of the variational derivative, we identify the term in the parenthesis as $\\mu_{\\text{el}}(\\mathbf{x})$. This holds provided $\\mathsf{C}$ is independent of $\\phi$.\n$$\\mu_{\\text{el}}(\\mathbf{x}) = -\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{x}) : \\frac{\\partial\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0(\\phi)}{\\partial\\phi}$$\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In a periodic domain with homogeneous $\\mathsf{C}$, the FFT-based approach reduces the per-iteration complexity of the elastic solve to $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$ by diagonalizing convolutions; the Fourier modes $\\mathbf{k}\\neq \\mathbf{0}$ decouple and are solved via small algebraic systems, enabling efficient updates of $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{k})$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}(\\mathbf{k})$.**\nThis statement accurately summarizes the key features and advantages of the FFT-based method. The transformation to Fourier space turns the convolution inherent in solving the elastic PDEs into simple pointwise multiplication, effectively \"diagonalizing\" the operator in the Fourier basis. This leads to the decoupling of Fourier modes, where each mode can be solved independently. The resulting computational complexity is dominated by the FFTs, which is $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$ for $N$ grid points.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. For homogeneous $\\mathsf{C}$, one computes $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{k})$ for $\\mathbf{k}\\neq \\mathbf{0}$ by applying a precomputed elastic Green operator $\\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{k})$ to $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0(\\mathbf{k})$, i.e., $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{k})=-\\mathsf{C}:\\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{k}):\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0(\\mathbf{k})$, handles the $\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{0}$ mode according to the imposed macroscopic constraint (e.g., fixed average strain or zero average stress), and obtains real-space fields by inverse FFT; the elastic energy is then computed as $F_{\\text{el}}=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\int_{\\Omega}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}-\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0):\\mathsf{C}:(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}-\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0)\\,\\mathrm{d}V$.**\nThis statement describes the procedure correctly. The relationship between stress and eigenstrain in Fourier space is linear and can be expressed via an operator, as shown. The form $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{k}) \\propto -\\mathsf{C}:\\mathbf{G}:\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0(\\mathbf{k})$ is a valid representation (though different conventions for $\\mathbf{G}$ exist). The handling of the $\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{0}$ mode and the use of inverse FFT are also described correctly. Finally, the expression for $F_{\\text{el}}$ is the fundamental, correct definition of elastic strain energy. While more efficient Fourier-space formulas exist for its computation, this definition is undeniably correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. The elastic contribution to the chemical potential is $\\mu_{\\text{el}}(\\mathbf{x})=-\\nabla\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{x})$, because mechanical equilibrium implies $\\nabla\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}=\\mathbf{0}$ and thus the divergence directly determines $\\mu_{\\text{el}}$.**\nThis statement is incorrect and contains a logical fallacy. The premise states that mechanical equilibrium implies $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathbf{0}$. The statement then claims $\\mu_{\\text{el}}(\\mathbf{x}) = -\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{x})$, which would mean $\\mu_{\\text{el}}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{0}$ everywhere. This is physically wrong; the elastic chemical potential is a primary driving force for microstructure evolution and is generally non-zero.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. If the coupling to elasticity enters only through $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0(\\phi)$ and $\\mathsf{C}$ is independent of $\\phi$, then the elastic contribution to the chemical potential is given by $\\mu_{\\text{el}}(\\mathbf{x})=-\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{x}):\\partial\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0/\\partial\\phi$.**\nThis is the correct formula for the elastic part of the chemical potential under the specified assumptions. As derived above from the variational derivative of the elastic free energy, $\\mu_{\\text{el}} = \\delta F_{\\text{el}} / \\delta\\phi$. The conditions mentioned in the option are precisely those used in the derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**E. The principal computational advantage of the FFT-based microelasticity method arises from assembling and inverting a dense finite element stiffness matrix at every iteration, which is particularly efficient for periodic boundary conditions.**\nThis statement fundamentally misrepresents the method. The FFT-based method's advantage lies in *avoiding* the assembly and inversion of any large stiffness matrix, be it sparse (as in FEM) or dense. It bypasses this expensive step entirely by working in Fourier space.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**F. In Fourier space, for each $\\mathbf{k}\\neq \\mathbf{0}$ one solves an algebraic system involving the acoustic (Christoffel) tensor $\\mathsf{N}(\\mathbf{k})$ with components $N_{lp}(\\mathbf{k})=C_{lpmn}k_m k_n$ to obtain a projection operator that maps $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0(\\mathbf{k})$ onto the compatible elastic strain $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}(\\mathbf{k})$; this mode-wise decoupling turns the convolution into pointwise multiplication in $\\mathbf{k}$-space.**\nThis statement provides a correct and detailed description of the mathematical underpinnings of the FFT method. The equilibrium equation in Fourier space leads to a system involving the Christoffel tensor $\\mathsf{N}(\\mathbf{k})$. Inverting this tensor (for each $\\mathbf{k}$) allows one to construct the operator that relates the compatible strain $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}(\\mathbf{k})$ to the source eigenstrain $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}^0(\\mathbf{k})$. This mode-wise operation is the essence of why the method is efficient, transforming a real-space convolution into a Fourier-space multiplication.\n**Verdict: Correct**",

You are to construct a semi-implicit Fourier spectral time-integration scheme that treats the linear terms implicitly and the nonlinear chemical potential explicitly, and then analyze the numerical stiffness introduced by the elastic coupling.\n\nAssume the field $c$ is discretized on $N$ uniformly spaced collocation points in the one-dimensional periodic domain $[0,L]$, and the spatial discretization uses a Fourier spectral method evaluated by the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The resolvable wavenumbers are $k_{m} = \\frac{2\\pi m}{L}$ with $m = -\\frac{N}{2}, \\ldots, \\frac{N}{2}$, and define the maximum resolved wavenumber $k_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\frac{\\pi N}{L}$.

Let the concentration at time step $n$ be a small perturbation $\\delta c^n$ around this base state: $c^n(x) = c^* + \\delta c^n(x)$.\nIn Fourier space, this is $\\widehat{c}^n(k) = \\widehat{c^*}(k) + \\widehat{\\delta c^n}(k)$.

For any non-zero wavenumber $k \\neq 0$, we have $\\widehat{c}^n(k) = \\widehat{\\delta c^n}(k)$.\n\nWe linearize the nonlinear term $\\widehat{(c^n)^3}(k)$:\n$$\n(c^n)^3 = (c^* + \\delta c^n)^3 = (c^*)^3 + 3(c^*)^2 \\delta c^n + \\mathcal{O}((\\delta c^n)^2)\n$$\nTaking the Fourier transform for $k \\neq 0$:\n$$\n\\widehat{(c^n)^3}(k) \\approx 3(c^*)^2 \\widehat{\\delta c^n}(k)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the scheme and considering only the perturbation terms $\\widehat{\\delta c}$:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\delta c}^{n+1}(k) = \\frac{\\widehat{\\delta c}^{n}(k) - \\Delta t M k^2 u \\left(3(c^*)^2 \\widehat{\\delta c}^{n}(k)\\right)}{1 + \\Delta t M k^2 \\left( r + B(k) + \\kappa k^2 \\right)}\n$$\nThe amplification factor $G(k)$ is the ratio $\\widehat{\\delta c}^{n+1}(k) / \\widehat{\\delta c}^{n}(k)$:\n$$\nG(k) = \\frac{1 - 3u(c^*)^2 \\Delta t M k^2}{1 + \\Delta t M k^2 \\left( r + B(k) + \\kappa k^2 \\right)}\n$$\nFor numerical stability, the magnitude of the amplification factor must be less than or equal to one for all resolvable wavenumbers $k$: $|G(k)| \\le 1$, which is equivalent to $-1 \\le G(k) \\le 1$.\n\nLet's analyze the denominator $D(k) = 1 + \\Delta t M k^2 \\left( r + B(k) + \\kappa k^2 \\right)$. Given $\\Delta t>0$, $M>0$, $k^2 \\ge 0$, $\\kappa>0$, and the assumption $r+B(k) \\ge 0$, it follows that $r+B(k)+\\kappa k^2 \\ge 0$. Thus, the denominator $D(k) \\ge 1$.\n\n1.  **Condition $G(k) \\le 1$**:\n    $$\n    \\frac{1 - 3u(c^*)^2 \\Delta t M k^2}{1 + \\Delta t M k^2 \\left( r + B(k) + \\kappa k^2 \\right)} \\le 1\n    $$\n    Since $D(k) \\ge 1$, we can multiply both sides by $D(k)$:\n    $$\n    1 - 3u(c^*)^2 \\Delta t M k^2 \\le 1 + \\Delta t M k^2 \\left( r + B(k) + \\kappa k^2 \\right)\n    $$\n    $$\n    0 \\le \\Delta t M k^2 \\left[ 3u(c^*)^2 + r + B(k) + \\kappa k^2 \\right]\n    $$\n    Given $u>0$, $(c^*)^2 \\ge 0$, $r+B(k) \\ge 0$, and $\\kappa k^2 \\ge 0$, this inequality is always satisfied.\n\n2.  **Condition $G(k) \\ge -1$**:\n    $$\n    \\frac{1 - 3u(c^*)^2 \\Delta t M k^2}{1 + \\Delta t M k^2 \\left( r + B(k) + \\kappa k^2 \\right)} \\ge -1\n    $$\n    $$\n    1 - 3u(c^*)^2 \\Delta t M k^2 \\ge -1 - \\Delta t M k^2 \\left( r + B(k) + \\kappa k^2 \\right)\n    $$\n    $$\n    2 \\ge 3u(c^*)^2 \\Delta t M k^2 - \\Delta t M k^2 \\left( r + B(k) + \\kappa k^2 \\right)\n    $$\n    $$\n    2 \\ge \\Delta t M k^2 \\left[ 3u(c^*)^2 - (r+B(k)) - \\kappa k^2 \\right]\n    $$\n    This inequality provides the sufficient stability condition on the timestep $\\Delta t$. If the term in brackets is non-positive, the inequality is trivial. If it is positive, we must have:\n    $$\n    \\Delta t \\le \\frac{2}{M k^2 \\left[ 3u(c^*)^2 - (r+B(k)) - \\kappa k^2 \\right]}\n    $$\n\n### Task 3: Derivation of the Maximum Timestep $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{max}}$\n\nThe stability condition must hold for all resolvable wavenumbers $k$ and for all valid choices of the parameters $c^*, r, B(k), \\kappa$ subject to the problem's constraints. To find a single timestep $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{max}}$ that guarantees stability, we must satisfy the most restrictive condition. This is found by maximizing the expression in the denominator over all variables and parameters:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{max}}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sup_{k, c^*, r, B, \\kappa} \\left\\{ M k^2 \\left[ 3u(c^*)^2 - (r+B(k)) - \\kappa k^2 \\right] \\right\\}\n$$\nThe supremum is taken over the allowed ranges:\n-   Wavenumbers $k \\in \\{ k_m = 2\\pi m/L \\mid |m| \\le N/2 \\}$, so $k^2 \\le k_{\\mathrm{max}}^2 = (\\pi N/L)^2$.\n-   Base state $|c^*| \\le 1$.\n-   Parameters $r, B(k)$ such that $r+B(k) \\ge 0$ for all $k$, and $B(k) \\ge 0$.\n-   Gradient energy coefficient $\\kappa > 0$.\n\nWe maximize the term $f(k, c^*, r, B, \\kappa) = k^2 \\left[ 3u(c^*)^2 - (r+B(k)) - \\kappa k^2 \\right]$ by finding the worst-case (most restrictive) choice for each parameter:\n1.  **Maximization over $\\kappa$**: The term $-\\kappa k^4$ is always non-positive. To maximize the expression, we must consider the limit where this stabilizing term is minimal, which is $\\kappa \\to 0^+$. The supremum is thus taken with $\\kappa = 0$.\n2.  **Maximization over $c^*$**: The term $3u(c^*)^2$ is maximized when $(c^*)^2$ is maximized. Given $|c^*| \\le 1$, the maximum value is $1$, occurring at $c^*=\\pm 1$.\n3.  **Maximization over $r$ and $B(k)$**: The term $-(r+B(k))$ is maximized when $r+B(k)$ is minimized. The constraint is $r+B(k) \\ge 0$, so its minimum value is $0$. This case is physically achievable, for example, with $r=0$ and $B(k)=0$ for all $k$.\n\nCombining these worst-case choices, the expression to maximize simplifies to:\n$$\n\\sup_k \\left\\{ k^2 \\left[ 3u(1)^2 - 0 - 0 \\right] \\right\\} = \\sup_k \\left\\{ 3u k^2 \\right\\}\n$$\nThis function, $3uk^2$, is monotonically increasing with $k^2$. Therefore, its maximum occurs at the largest possible value of $k^2$, which is $k_{\\mathrm{max}}^2$.\n$$\n\\sup_{k, c^*, r, B, \\kappa} f = 3u k_{\\mathrm{max}}^2 = 3u \\left( \\frac{\\pi N}{L} \\right)^2\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{max}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{max}}} = \\frac{1}{2} M \\left[ 3u \\left( \\frac{\\pi N}{L} \\right)^2 \\right]\n$$\nSolving for $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{max}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\frac{2}{3 M u \\left( \\frac{\\pi N}{L} \\right)^2} = \\frac{2L^2}{3 M u \\pi^2 N^2}\n$$\nThis expression gives the largest timestep that guarantees linear stability under the specified assumptions. The units are consistent, yielding seconds if the input parameters are in a consistent SI-based system.",
