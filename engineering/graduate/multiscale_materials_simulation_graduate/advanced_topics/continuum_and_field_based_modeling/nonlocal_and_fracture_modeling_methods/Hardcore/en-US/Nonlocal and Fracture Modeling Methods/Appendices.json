Derive a closed-form expression for the critical half-crack length, $a_c$, at which a given stress $\\sigma$ causes crack initiation.

State how $E'$ specializes under plane stress and plane strain conditions.\n    4. Provide the final expression for $a_c$ in terms of $E'$, $G_c$, and $\\sigma$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is a classic exercise in Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM).\n- **Scientifically Grounded (Critical)**: The problem is fundamentally sound. It is based on the Griffith theory of brittle fracture, a cornerstone of solid mechanics and materials science. All concepts, including energy release rate ($G$), fracture toughness ($G_c$), and effective modulus ($E'$), are well-established scientific principles.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. The setup (infinite plate with a central crack under remote tension) has a known, unique solution within the framework of LEFM. The givens are sufficient to derive the requested relationship.\n- **Objective (Critical)**: The language is precise, technical, and devoid of subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\nThe problem exhibits no flaws; it is a standard, formalizable problem in continuum mechanics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution begins from the first principle of energy balance as formulated by Griffith. The core idea is that a crack will extend if the mechanical energy released from the strained elastic body is sufficient to provide the energy required to create the new crack surfaces.\n\nThe energy release rate, $G$, is defined as the rate of decrease of the total potential energy, $\\Pi$, of the system with respect to an infinitesimal increase in crack area, $A$.\n$$\nG = -\\frac{d\\Pi}{dA}\n$$\nThe total potential energy $\\Pi$ is the sum of the stored elastic strain energy, $U$, and the potential of the external forces, which is the negative of the work done by them, $-W$. Thus, $\\Pi = U - W$.\n\nFor a through-thickness crack of length $2a$ in a plate of unit thickness, the crack area is $A = 2a$. The derivative with respect to area can be written in terms of the derivative with respect to the half-crack length $a$:\n$$\ndA = d(2a) = 2da\n$$\nTherefore, the energy release rate per unit thickness is:\n$$\nG = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d\\Pi}{da}\n$$\nA fundamental result from elasticity theory for a linear elastic body is that the expression for $G$ is identical for both fixed-load and fixed-displacement boundary conditions. We can derive $G$ by considering the change in the system's strain energy.\n\nFor an infinite plate under a remote tensile stress $\\sigma$, the introduction of a crack of length $2a$ relieves strain energy. The amount of elastic strain energy released from the body, per unit thickness, is given by the classic result:\n$$\nU_{released} = \\frac{\\pi \\sigma^2 a^2}{E'}\n$$\nThe potential energy of the cracked plate, $\\Pi(a)$, can be expressed relative to the potential energy of the uncracked plate, $\\Pi_0$. The introduction of the crack decreases the potential energy by $U_{released}$.\n$$\n\\Pi(a) = \\Pi_0 - U_{released} = \\Pi_0 - \\frac{\\pi \\sigma^2 a^2}{E'}\n$$\nNow, we can compute the energy release rate $G$ by substituting this expression for $\\Pi(a)$ into the definition of $G$:\n$$\nG = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d}{da} \\left( \\Pi_0 - \\frac{\\pi \\sigma^2 a^2}{E'} \\right)\n$$\nSince $\\Pi_0$ is a constant with respect to $a$, its derivative is zero.\n$$\nG = -\\frac{1}{2} \\left( -\\frac{d}{da} \\left(\\frac{\\pi \\sigma^2 a^2}{E'}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\sigma^2 a}{E'} \\right)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the well-known expression for the energy release rate for a mode I crack in an infinite plate:\n$$\nG = \\frac{\\pi \\sigma^2 a}{E'}\n$$\nThis quantity $G$ represents the \"driving force\" for crack propagation, i.e., the amount of energy available per unit area of crack extension.\n\nThe Griffith fracture criterion states that crack initiation occurs when this driving force, $G$, equals the material's resistance to fracture. This resistance is the critical energy release rate, $G_c$, which is a material property also known as fracture toughness. The criterion is:\n$$\nG = G_c\n$$\nSubstituting our derived expression for $G$ into the criterion gives the condition for fracture:\n$$\n\\frac{\\pi \\sigma^2 a}{E'} = G_c\n$$\nThe problem asks for the critical half-crack length, $a_c$, for which a given applied stress $\\sigma$ causes fracture. We solve the above equation for $a$, which we designate as $a_c$.\n$$\n\\pi \\sigma^2 a_c = G_c E'\n$$\n$$\na_c = \\frac{G_c E'}{\\pi \\sigma^2}\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the critical half-crack length.\n\n### Interpretation of Parameters\n\n1.  **Critical Energy Release Rate ($G_c$)**: $G_c$ is a measure of a material's fracture toughness. It represents the critical amount of energy that must be absorbed per unit area of newly created crack surface to cause fracture. For ideally brittle materials, this corresponds to the surface energy required to break atomic bonds ($G_c = 2\\gamma_s$, where $\\gamma_s$ is the surface energy per unit area). For real engineering materials, $G_c$ is dominated by the energy dissipated through plastic deformation in a small region at the crack tip and is therefore many orders of magnitude larger than the true surface energy. It is a fundamental material property determined experimentally.\n\n2.  **Effective Elastic Modulus ($E'$)**: $E'$ is the elastic modulus that is appropriate for the state of stress and strain within the plate. It is not an independent material constant but is derived from Young's modulus, $E$, and Poisson's ratio, $\\nu$. It accounts for the kinematic constraints imposed by the plate's thickness. Its presence in the equation indicates that the energy storage capacity (i.e., stiffness) of the material directly influences the energy balance that governs fracture.\n\nThe specialization of $E'$ depends on the plate thickness relative to the plastic zone size at the crack tip:\n\n-   **Plane Stress**: This condition prevails in thin plates where stresses perpendicular to the plate faces are negligible ($\\sigma_{zz} = 0$). The material is free to contract in the thickness direction. In this case, the effective modulus is the Young's modulus:\n    $$\n    E' = E\n    $$\n-   **Plane Strain**: This condition prevails in thick plates where strain in the thickness direction is constrained to be zero ($\\epsilon_{zz} = 0$) due to the bulk of the surrounding material. This constraint makes the material effectively stiffer in the plane of loading. In this case, the effective modulus is:\n    $$\n    E' = \\frac{E}{1 - \\nu^2}\n    $$\nwhere $\\nu$ is the Poisson's ratio of the material.",

It is not trivial or contrived.\n7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability**: The derivation and its result are verifiable within the mathematical and physical framework of peridynamic mechanics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in the field of computational mechanics. A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe fracture energy, $G_c$, is defined as the total energy released (which was stored in the bonds) per unit area of the newly created crack surface. The problem specifies we should calculate this by summing the energy of all bonds that cross a flat crack plane.\n\nLet the crack lie on the $xy$-plane, defined by $z=0$. The material exists in all of $\\mathbb{R}^3$. A bond between a material point $x$ and another point $x'$ crosses this plane if the points are on opposite sides of the plane. The energy of these broken bonds is what contributes to $G_c$.\n\nThe strain energy density $W$ at a material point $x$ in a peridynamic solid is defined as the energy per unit volume, which is half the sum of energies of all bonds connected to it:\n$$W(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\mathcal{H}_x} w(|\\xi|, s) dV_{x'}$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{H}_x$ is the spherical horizon of radius $\\delta$ centered at $x$, and $w(|\\xi|, s)$ is the pairwise bond energy density. The problem states that the pairwise force density is proportional to stretch, which for a linear microelastic material implies $t = c s$. The work conjugate, representing the potential energy stored in a bond per pair of unit volumes, is $\\int c s' |\\xi| ds' = \\frac{1}{2}c s^2 |\\xi|$. However, the standard definition of the bond energy potential is such that the strain energy density $W(x)$ at point $x$ is:\n$$W(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\mathcal{H}_x} c s^2 |\\xi| dV_{x'}$$\nThis formulation ensures that the micro-modulus $c$ has units of energy per length to the sixth power (e.g., Joules/meter$^6$), making $W(x)$ a proper energy density (Joules/meter$^3$).\n\nWe calculate $G_c$ by integrating the energy contributions of all broken bonds over a column of unit area perpendicular to the crack plane. By symmetry, we can consider the energy stored in bonds originating from the upper half-space ($z>0$) that cross into the lower half-space ($z0$) and integrate this contribution along the positive $z$-axis.\n$$G_c = \\int_{z=0}^{\\infty} W_{\\text{broken}}(z) dz$$\nHere, $W_{\\text{broken}}(z)$ is the portion of the strain energy density at height $z$ that is due to bonds crossing the $z=0$ plane. A point at $x=(0,0,z)$ for $z>0$ will have bonds crossing the plane only if its neighbors $x'$ are in the lower half-plane ($z'0$). Since bonds only exist for separation $|\\xi|  \\delta$, a point at $x$ can only have bonds crossing the plane if $z  \\delta$. Therefore, the integration limit is $\\delta$.\n\nFor a point $x$ at height $z$ above the plane, a bond to a point $x'$ at a relative position $\\xi = x' - x$ crosses the plane if the $z$-coordinate of $x'$, which is $z + \\xi_z$, is less than $0$. This implies $\\xi_z  -z$. According to the problem statement, all such bonds fail at the critical stretch $s_c$. The energy density contribution from these broken bonds at height $z$ is:\n$$W_{\\text{broken}}(z) = \\frac{1}{2} c s_c^2 \\int_{\\substack{\\xi \\in \\mathcal{H} \\\\ \\xi_z  -z}} |\\xi| dV_{\\xi}$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{H}$ is a sphere of radius $\\delta$ centered at the origin of the $\\xi$ coordinate system.\n\nThe total fracture energy per unit area is then:\n$$G_c = \\int_{0}^{\\delta} W_{\\text{broken}}(z) dz = \\frac{1}{2} c s_c^2 \\int_{0}^{\\delta} \\left( \\int_{\\substack{|\\xi|\\delta \\\\ \\xi_z  -z}} |\\xi| dV_{\\xi} \\right) dz$$\nLet's evaluate the inner integral, $I(z) = \\int_{\\substack{|\\xi|\\delta \\\\ \\xi_z  -z}} |\\xi| dV_{\\xi}$. We use spherical coordinates for $\\xi$, where $\\xi = (\\rho\\sin\\phi\\cos\\theta, \\rho\\sin\\phi\\sin\\theta, \\rho\\cos\\phi)$. In these coordinates, $|\\xi|=\\rho$ and $dV_{\\xi} = \\rho^2 \\sin\\phi \\, d\\rho \\, d\\phi \\, d\\theta$.\nThe conditions on the integration domain are:\n1.  $0 \\le \\rho \\le \\delta$\n2.  $\\xi_z = \\rho\\cos\\phi  -z \\implies \\cos\\phi  -z/\\rho$\n\nFor the condition on $\\phi$ to be possible, we must have $-z/\\rho \\ge -1$, which implies $\\rho \\ge z$. Thus, the integral over $\\rho$ runs from $z$ to $\\delta$. The range for $\\phi$ is from $\\arccos(-z/\\rho)$ to $\\pi$. The integral over $\\theta$ is from $0$ to $2\\pi$.\n\n$$I(z) = \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\theta \\int_{z}^{\\delta} d\\rho \\int_{\\arccos(-z/\\rho)}^{\\pi} d\\phi \\, (\\rho) (\\rho^2 \\sin\\phi)$$\n$$I(z) = 2\\pi \\int_{z}^{\\delta} \\rho^3 \\left( \\int_{\\arccos(-z/\\rho)}^{\\pi} \\sin\\phi \\, d\\phi \\right) d\\rho$$\nThe integral over $\\phi$ is:\n$$\\int_{\\arccos(-z/\\rho)}^{\\pi} \\sin\\phi \\, d\\phi = [-\\cos\\phi]_{\\arccos(-z/\\rho)}^{\\pi} = -(-1) - (-\\cos(\\arccos(-z/\\rho))) = 1 - \\frac{z}{\\rho}$$\nSubstituting this back:\n$$I(z) = 2\\pi \\int_{z}^{\\delta} \\rho^3 \\left(1 - \\frac{z}{\\rho}\\right) d\\rho = 2\\pi \\int_{z}^{\\delta} (\\rho^3 - z\\rho^2) d\\rho$$\n$$I(z) = 2\\pi \\left[\\frac{\\rho^4}{4} - \\frac{z\\rho^3}{3}\\right]_{z}^{\\delta} = 2\\pi \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\delta^4}{4} - \\frac{z\\delta^3}{3}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{z^4}{4} - \\frac{z^4}{3}\\right) \\right]$$\n$$I(z) = 2\\pi \\left( \\frac{\\delta^4}{4} - \\frac{z\\delta^3}{3} + \\frac{z^4}{12} \\right)$$\nNow, we perform the outer integral over $z$ from $0$ to $\\delta$:\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\delta} I(z) dz = 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{\\delta} \\left( \\frac{\\delta^4}{4} - \\frac{z\\delta^3}{3} + \\frac{z^4}{12} \\right) dz$$\n$$= 2\\pi \\left[ \\frac{\\delta^4 z}{4} - \\frac{\\delta^3 z^2}{6} + \\frac{z^5}{60} \\right]_{0}^{\\delta}$$\n$$= 2\\pi \\left( \\frac{\\delta^5}{4} - \\frac{\\delta^5}{6} + \\frac{\\delta^5}{60} \\right) = 2\\pi \\delta^5 \\left( \\frac{15-10+1}{60} \\right) = 2\\pi \\delta^5 \\left( \\frac{6}{60} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi\\delta^5}{5}$$\nFinally, we substitute this result back into the expression for $G_c$:\n$$G_c = \\frac{1}{2} c s_c^2 \\left( \\frac{\\pi\\delta^5}{5} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi c s_c^2 \\delta^5}{10}$$\nThe problem asks for an expression for the critical stretch $s_c$.

Damage can initiate only when the driving force $2\\psi_e$ is sufficient to overcome the resistance $\\frac{G_c}{l}$. The threshold is met when $2\\psi_e = \\frac{G_c}{l}$. Let the corresponding critical elastic energy density be $\\psi_{ec}$.\n$2\\psi_{ec} = \\frac{G_c}{l} \\implies \\psi_{ec} = \\frac{G_c}{2l}$.\nSubstituting $\\psi_e = \\frac{1}{2} E \\varepsilon^2$, the critical strain $\\varepsilon_c$ is found from $E \\varepsilon_c^2 = \\frac{G_c}{l}$.\nFor $\\psi_e  \\psi_{ec}$, we have $d_0=0$, and the stress is $\\sigma = g(0) E \\varepsilon = E \\varepsilon = E \\frac{U}{L}$.\nFor $\\psi_e \\ge \\psi_{ec}$, damage evolves according to the equilibrium equation:\n$1-d_0 = \\frac{G_c}{2l\\psi_e}$. We can write $d_0 = 1 - \\frac{G_c}{2l\\psi_e} = 1 - \\frac{G_c L^2}{l E U^2}$.\nThe stress is $\\sigma = g(d_0) E \\varepsilon = (1-d_0)^2 E \\frac{U}{L}$.\nSubstituting the expression for $(1-d_0)$:\n$$\n\\sigma(U) = \\left( \\frac{G_c}{2l\\psi_e} \\right)^2 E \\frac{U}{L} = \\left( \\frac{G_c}{l E (U/L)^2} \\right)^2 E \\frac{U}{L} = \\frac{G_c^2 L^3}{l^2 E U^3}\n$$\nSo, for AT1, the response is linear elastic up to a critical displacement, followed by softening.\n\n**For the AT2 model ($w(d)=d^2$, $w'(d)=2d$):**\nThe stationarity condition is $-2(1-d_0)\\psi_e + \\frac{G_c}{l} (2d_0) = 0$, which gives $(1-d_0)\\psi_e = \\frac{G_c}{l} d_0$.\nSolving for $d_0$:\n$\\psi_e - d_0 \\psi_e = \\frac{G_c}{l} d_0 \\implies \\psi_e = d_0 \\left( \\psi_e + \\frac{G_c}{l} \\right)$.\n$$\nd_0 = \\frac{\\psi_e}{\\psi_e + G_c/l} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} E (U/L)^2}{\\frac{1}{2} E (U/L)^2 + G_c/l}\n$$\nIn this case, for any displacement $U0$, we have $\\psi_e  0$ and thus $d_0  0$.

Condition for Crack Nucleation**\n\nCrack nucleation can be understood as the instability of the undamaged state $d(x)=0$. We examine the conditions under which it is energetically favorable for damage to increase from $0$. Let's consider the local energy density part of the functional, $\\Psi_v(d) = g(d) \\psi_e + G_c \\frac{w(d)}{l}$. Damage will initiate from $d=0$ if the potential energy can be decreased by an infinitesimal increase in $d$, i.e., if $\\frac{\\partial \\Psi_v}{\\partial d}|_{d=0}  0$. (The gradient term $l(d')^2$ penalizes spatial variations and is non-negative, and for homogeneous nucleation $d'=0$.)\nThe derivative is $\\frac{\\partial \\Psi_v}{\\partial d} = g'(d)\\psi_e + \\frac{G_c}{l}w'(d)$.\nAt $d=0$, this becomes $g'(0)\\psi_e + \\frac{G_c}{l}w'(0)$.\nWe use $g'(d) = -2(1-d)$, so $g'(0)=-2$.\n\n**For AT1 ($w(d)=d$, $w'(d)=1$, $w'(0)=1$):**\nThe derivative at $d=0$ is $-2\\psi_e + \\frac{G_c}{l}$.\nThe undamaged state $d=0$ is stable as long as this quantity is positive (increasing $d$ increases energy), i.e., $-2\\psi_e + \\frac{G_c}{l}  0 \\implies 2\\psi_e  \\frac{G_c}{l}$.\nThe threshold for instability (nucleation) is met when the derivative is zero:\n$$\n-2\\psi_e + \\frac{G_c}{l} = 0 \\implies 2\\psi_e = \\frac{G_c}{l}\n$$\nThis defines the critical condition for crack nucleation. Substituting $\\psi_e = \\frac{1}{2} E (\\frac{U}{L})^2$:\n$2 \\left( \\frac{1}{2} E \\left(\\frac{U_c}{L}\\right)^2 \\right) = \\frac{G_c}{l} \\implies E \\frac{U_c^2}{L^2} = \\frac{G_c}{l}$.\nSolving for the critical displacement $U_c$:\n$$\nU_c = L \\sqrt{\\frac{G_c}{El}}\n$$\n\n**For AT2 ($w(d)=d^2$, $w'(d)=2d$, $w'(0)=0$):**\nThe derivative at $d=0$ is $-2\\psi_e + \\frac{G_c}{l}(0) = -2\\psi_e$.\nFor any loading $U0$, we have $\\psi_e  0$, so the derivative $-2\\psi_e$ is strictly negative. This means that for any non-zero strain, it is always energetically favorable for damage to increase from $d=0$.\nThus, for the AT2 model, there is no finite energy barrier to nucleation. Damage begins to accumulate as soon as the bar is loaded ($U0$). This is a qualitatively different behavior, often referred to as \"barrierless nucleation.\"\n\n**3. Interpretation of the role of $w(d)$**\n\nThe choice of the crack surface density function $w(d)$ fundamentally controls the damage initiation criterion and the subsequent softening behavior.\n\n-   **AT1 model ($w(d)=d$):** The linear dependence on $d$ results in a non-zero derivative at the origin, $w'(0)=1$. This term, $G_c w'(0)/l = G_c/l$, acts as a constant energy barrier or threshold that must be overcome by the elastic energy release rate ($2\\psi_e$) to initiate damage. This behavior is analogous to a strength criterion in classical material models. It leads to a distinct linear elastic regime followed by the onset of failure at a critical stress/strain, resulting in a sharp \"knee\" in the load-displacement curve. This model is often favored when a clear material strength value is to be represented.\n\n-   **AT2 model ($w(d)=d^2$):** The quadratic dependence on $d$ results in a zero derivative at the origin, $w'(0)=0$. This implies that there is no initial energy barrier to overcome. The resistance to damage, proportional to $w'(d)=2d$, is initially zero and grows with the damage itself. Consequently, damage starts to accumulate from the very beginning of the loading process. This results in a load-displacement curve that is nonlinear from the start, with a smooth, rounded peak rather than a sharp yield point. Mathematically, the AT2 functional is preferred for its property of $\\Gamma$-convergence to the Griffith sharp-crack model as the length scale $l \\to 0$, providing a more rigorous regularization of brittle fracture.\n\nIn summary, $w(d)=d$ models a material with a finite strength, exhibiting a distinct failure initiation point. In contrast, $w(d)=d^2$ models a material where damage initiation is barrierless, and degradation occurs progressively from the onset of loading, representing a toughness-controlled process.",
