            "solution": "### Solution Derivation\n\nThe fracture energy, $G_c$, is defined as the total energy released (which was stored in the bonds) per unit area of the newly created crack surface. The problem specifies we should calculate this by summing the energy of all bonds that cross a flat crack plane.\n\nLet the crack lie on the $xy$-plane, defined by $z=0$. The material exists in all of $\\mathbb{R}^3$. A bond between a material point $x$ and another point $x'$ crosses this plane if the points are on opposite sides of the plane. The energy of these broken bonds is what contributes to $G_c$.\n\nThe strain energy density $W$ at a material point $x$ in a peridynamic solid is defined as the energy per unit volume, which is half the sum of energies of all bonds connected to it:\n$$W(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\mathcal{H}_x} w(|\\xi|, s) dV_{x'}$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{H}_x$ is the spherical horizon of radius $\\delta$ centered at $x$, and $w(|\\xi|, s)$ is the pairwise bond energy density. For a linear microelastic material, the pairwise energy density is $w(|\\xi|, s) = c s^2 |\\xi|$.\nThis formulation ensures that the micro-modulus $c$ has units of energy per length to the sixth power (e.g., Joules/meter$^6$), making $W(x)$ a proper energy density (Joules/meter$^3$).\n\nWe calculate $G_c$ by integrating the energy contributions of all broken bonds over a column of unit area perpendicular to the crack plane. By symmetry, we can consider the energy stored in bonds originating from the upper half-space ($z>0$) that cross into the lower half-space ($z<0$) and integrate this contribution along the positive $z$-axis.\n$$G_c = \\int_{z=0}^{\\infty} W_{\\text{broken}}(z) dz$$\nHere, $W_{\\text{broken}}(z)$ is the portion of the strain energy density at height $z$ that is due to bonds crossing the $z=0$ plane. A point at $x=(0,0,z)$ for $z>0$ will have bonds crossing the plane only if its neighbors $x'$ are in the lower half-plane ($z'<0$). Since bonds only exist for separation $|\\xi| < \\delta$, a point at $x$ can only have bonds crossing the plane if $z < \\delta$. Therefore, the integration limit is $\\delta$.\n\nFor a point $x$ at height $z$ above the plane, a bond to a point $x'$ at a relative position $\\xi = x' - x$ crosses the plane if the $z$-coordinate of $x'$, which is $z + \\xi_z$, is less than $0$. This implies $\\xi_z < -z$. According to the problem statement, all such bonds fail at the critical stretch $s_c$. The energy density contribution from these broken bonds at height $z$ is:\n$$W_{\\text{broken}}(z) = \\frac{1}{2} c s_c^2 \\int_{\\substack{\\xi \\in \\mathcal{H} \\\\ \\xi_z < -z}} |\\xi| dV_{\\xi}$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{H}$ is a sphere of radius $\\delta$ centered at the origin of the $\\xi$ coordinate system.\n\nThe total fracture energy per unit area is then:\n$$G_c = \\int_{0}^{\\delta} W_{\\text{broken}}(z) dz = \\frac{1}{2} c s_c^2 \\int_{0}^{\\delta} \\left( \\int_{\\substack{|\\xi|<\\delta \\\\ \\xi_z < -z}} |\\xi| dV_{\\xi} \\right) dz$$\nLet's evaluate the inner integral, $I(z) = \\int_{\\substack{|\\xi|<\\delta \\\\ \\xi_z < -z}} |\\xi| dV_{\\xi}$. We use spherical coordinates for $\\xi$, where $\\xi = (\\rho\\sin\\phi\\cos\\theta, \\rho\\sin\\phi\\sin\\theta, \\rho\\cos\\phi)$. In these coordinates, $|\\xi|=\\rho$ and $dV_{\\xi} = \\rho^2 \\sin\\phi \\, d\\rho \\, d\\phi \\, d\\theta$.\nThe conditions on the integration domain are:\n1.  $0 \\le \\rho \\le \\delta$\n2.  $\\xi_z = \\rho\\cos\\phi < -z \\implies \\cos\\phi < -z/\\rho$\n\nFor the condition on $\\phi$ to be possible, we must have $-z/\\rho \\ge -1$, which implies $\\rho \\ge z$. Thus, the integral over $\\rho$ runs from $z$ to $\\delta$. The range for $\\phi$ is from $\\arccos(-z/\\rho)$ to $\\pi$. The integral over $\\theta$ is from $0$ to $2\\pi$.\n\n$$I(z) = \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\theta \\int_{z}^{\\delta} d\\rho \\int_{\\arccos(-z/\\rho)}^{\\pi} d\\phi \\, (\\rho) (\\rho^2 \\sin\\phi)$$\n$$I(z) = 2\\pi \\int_{z}^{\\delta} \\rho^3 \\left( \\int_{\\arccos(-z/\\rho)}^{\\pi} \\sin\\phi \\, d\\phi \\right) d\\rho$$\nThe integral over $\\phi$ is:\n$$\\int_{\\arccos(-z/\\rho)}^{\\pi} \\sin\\phi \\, d\\phi = [-\\cos\\phi]_{\\arccos(-z/\\rho)}^{\\pi} = -(-1) - (-\\cos(\\arccos(-z/\\rho))) = 1 - \\frac{z}{\\rho}$$\nSubstituting this back:\n$$I(z) = 2\\pi \\int_{z}^{\\delta} \\rho^3 \\left(1 - \\frac{z}{\\rho}\\right) d\\rho = 2\\pi \\int_{z}^{\\delta} (\\rho^3 - z\\rho^2) d\\rho$$\n$$I(z) = 2\\pi \\left[\\frac{\\rho^4}{4} - \\frac{z\\rho^3}{3}\\right]_{z}^{\\delta} = 2\\pi \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\delta^4}{4} - \\frac{z\\delta^3}{3}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{z^4}{4} - \\frac{z^4}{3}\\right) \\right]$$\n$$I(z) = 2\\pi \\left( \\frac{\\delta^4}{4} - \\frac{z\\delta^3}{3} + \\frac{z^4}{12} \\right)$$\nNow, we perform the outer integral over $z$ from $0$ to $\\delta$:\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\delta} I(z) dz = 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{\\delta} \\left( \\frac{\\delta^4}{4} - \\frac{z\\delta^3}{3} + \\frac{z^4}{12} \\right) dz$$\n$$= 2\\pi \\left[ \\frac{\\delta^4 z}{4} - \\frac{\\delta^3 z^2}{6} + \\frac{z^5}{60} \\right]_{0}^{\\delta}$$\n$$= 2\\pi \\left( \\frac{\\delta^5}{4} - \\frac{\\delta^5}{6} + \\frac{\\delta^5}{60} \\right) = 2\\pi \\delta^5 \\left( \\frac{15-10+1}{60} \\right) = 2\\pi \\delta^5 \\left( \\frac{6}{60} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi\\delta^5}{5}$$\nFinally, we substitute this result back into the expression for $G_c$:\n$$G_c = \\frac{1}{2} c s_c^2 \\left( \\frac{\\pi\\delta^5}{5} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi c s_c^2 \\delta^5}{10}$$\nThe problem asks for an expression for the critical stretch $s_c$.

Homogeneous Damage Analysis and Load-Displacement Response**\n\nWe consider the simplifying assumption of a spatially homogeneous damage field, $d(x) = d_0$. This is consistent with the uniform tension state and satisfies the specified Neumann boundary conditions for the phase field, $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}d}{\\mathrm{d}x}(0)=\\frac{\\mathrm{d}d}{\\mathrm{d}x}(L)=0$, as $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}d_0}{\\mathrm{d}x} = 0$.

For a given displacement $U$ (and thus fixed $\\psi_e$), the equilibrium value of $d_0$ is found from the stationarity condition $\\frac{\\partial \\Psi(d_0)}{\\partial d_0} = 0$, constrained by $d_0 \\in [0,1]$ and the irreversibility condition that damage can only increase.\n\nThe stationarity condition is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Psi}{\\partial d_0} = L \\left( g'(d_0) \\, \\psi_e + \\frac{G_c}{l} w'(d_0) \\right) = 0\n$$\nwhere $g'(d_0) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}d_0}(1-d_0)^2 = -2(1-d_0)$.\nSo, the condition becomes $ -2(1-d_0)\\psi_e + \\frac{G_c}{l} w'(d_0) = 0 $.\n\n**For the AT1 model ($w(d)=d$, $w'(d)=1$):**\nThe stationarity condition is $-2(1-d_0)\\psi_e + \\frac{G_c}{l} = 0$, which gives $2(1-d_0)\\psi_e = \\frac{G_c}{l}$.\nInitially, the bar is undamaged, $d_0=0$. Damage can initiate only when the driving force $2\\psi_e$ is sufficient to overcome the resistance $\\frac{G_c}{l}$. The threshold is met when $2\\psi_e = \\frac{G_c}{l}$. Let the corresponding critical elastic energy density be $\\psi_{ec}$.\n$2\\psi_{ec} = \\frac{G_c}{l} \\implies \\psi_{ec} = \\frac{G_c}{2l}$.\nSubstituting $\\psi_e = \\frac{1}{2} E \\varepsilon^2$, the critical strain $\\varepsilon_c$ is found from $E \\varepsilon_c^2 = \\frac{G_c}{l}$.\nFor $\\psi_e < \\psi_{ec}$, we have $d_0=0$, and the stress is $\\sigma = g(0) E \\varepsilon = E \\varepsilon = E \\frac{U}{L}$.\nFor $\\psi_e \\ge \\psi_{ec}$, damage evolves according to the equilibrium equation:\n$1-d_0 = \\frac{G_c}{2l\\psi_e}$.

Condition for Crack Nucleation**\n\nCrack nucleation can be understood as the instability of the undamaged state $d(x)=0$. We examine the conditions under which it is energetically favorable for damage to increase from $0$. Let's consider the local energy density part of the functional, $\\Psi_v(d) = g(d) \\psi_e + G_c \\frac{w(d)}{l}$. Damage will initiate from $d=0$ if the potential energy can be decreased by an infinitesimal increase in $d$, i.e., if $\\frac{\\partial \\Psi_v}{\\partial d}|_{d=0} < 0$. (The gradient term $l(d')^2$ penalizes spatial variations and is non-negative, and for homogeneous nucleation $d'=0$.)\nThe derivative is $\\frac{\\partial \\Psi_v}{\\partial d} = g'(d)\\psi_e + \\frac{G_c}{l}w'(d)$.\nAt $d=0$, this becomes $g'(0)\\psi_e + \\frac{G_c}{l}w'(0)$.\nWe use $g'(d) = -2(1-d)$, so $g'(0)=-2$.\n\n**For AT1 ($w(d)=d$, $w'(d)=1$, $w'(0)=1$):**\nThe derivative at $d=0$ is $-2\\psi_e + \\frac{G_c}{l}$.\nThe undamaged state $d=0$ is stable as long as this quantity is positive (increasing $d$ increases energy), i.e., $-2\\psi_e + \\frac{G_c}{l} > 0 \\implies 2\\psi_e < \\frac{G_c}{l}$.\nThe threshold for instability (nucleation) is met when the derivative is zero:\n$$\n-2\\psi_e + \\frac{G_c}{l} = 0 \\implies 2\\psi_e = \\frac{G_c}{l}\n$$\nThis defines the critical condition for crack nucleation. Substituting $\\psi_e = \\frac{1}{2} E (\\frac{U}{L})^2$:\n$2 \\left( \\frac{1}{2} E \\left(\\frac{U_c}{L}\\right)^2 \\right) = \\frac{G_c}{l} \\implies E \\frac{U_c^2}{L^2} = \\frac{G_c}{l}$.\nSolving for the critical displacement $U_c$:\n$$\nU_c = L \\sqrt{\\frac{G_c}{El}}\n$$\n\n**For AT2 ($w(d)=d^2$, $w'(d)=2d$, $w'(0)=0$):**\nThe derivative at $d=0$ is $-2\\psi_e + \\frac{G_c}{l}(0) = -2\\psi_e$.\nFor any loading $U>0$, we have $\\psi_e > 0$, so the derivative $-2\\psi_e$ is strictly negative. This means that for any non-zero strain, it is always energetically favorable for damage to increase from $d=0$.\nThus, for the AT2 model, there is no finite energy barrier to nucleation. Damage begins to accumulate as soon as the bar is loaded ($U>0$). This is a qualitatively different behavior, often referred to as \"barrierless nucleation.\"\n\n**3. Interpretation of the role of $w(d)$**\n\nThe choice of the crack surface density function $w(d)$ fundamentally controls the damage initiation criterion and the subsequent softening behavior.\n\n-   **AT1 model ($w(d)=d$):** The linear dependence on $d$ results in a non-zero derivative at the origin, $w'(0)=1$. This term, $G_c w'(0)/l = G_c/l$, acts as a constant energy barrier or threshold that must be overcome by the elastic energy release rate ($2\\psi_e$) to initiate damage. This behavior is analogous to a strength criterion in classical material models. It leads to a distinct linear elastic regime followed by the onset of failure at a critical stress/strain, resulting in a sharp \"knee\" in the load-displacement curve. This model is often favored when a clear material strength value is to be represented.\n\n-   **AT2 model ($w(d)=d^2$):** The quadratic dependence on $d$ results in a zero derivative at the origin, $w'(0)=0$. This implies that there is no initial energy barrier to overcome. The resistance to damage, proportional to $w'(d)=2d$, is initially zero and grows with the damage itself. Consequently, damage starts to accumulate from the very beginning of the loading process. This results in a load-displacement curve that is nonlinear from the start, with a smooth, rounded peak rather than a sharp yield point. Mathematically, the AT2 functional is preferred for its property of $\\Gamma$-convergence to the Griffith sharp-crack model as the length scale $l \\to 0$, providing a more rigorous regularization of brittle fracture.\n\nIn summary, $w(d)=d$ models a material with a finite strength, exhibiting a distinct failure initiation point. In contrast, $w(d)=d^2$ models a material where damage initiation is barrierless, and degradation occurs progressively from the onset of loading, representing a toughness-controlled process.",

We assume $L$ is sufficiently large such that the boundary at $\\xi=L$ does not truncate the kernel's support for $x \\in [0, \\delta]$, i.e., $x+\\delta \\le L$.\nThe integration for $V(x)$ is thus from $0$ to $x+\\delta$.\n$$\nV(x) = \\int_{0}^{x+\\delta} \\frac{1}{2\\delta} \\, d\\xi = \\frac{1}{2\\delta} [\\xi]_{0}^{x+\\delta} = \\frac{x+\\delta-0}{2\\delta} = \\frac{x+\\delta}{2\\delta}\n$$\nSo, for $x \\in [0, \\delta]$, the normalization factor is $V(x) = \\frac{x+\\delta}{2\\delta}$. The renormalized kernel is $\\tilde{\\alpha}(x,\\xi) = \\frac{1}{x+\\delta}\\chi_{|\\xi-x|\\le\\delta}$ for $\\xi \\in \\Omega$.\n\nNext, we compute the nonlocal strain estimators for the uniform strain displacement field $u(\\xi) = E\\,\\xi$. The fraction inside the integral becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{u(\\xi)-u(x)}{\\xi-x} = \\frac{E\\,\\xi - E\\,x}{\\xi-x} = \\frac{E(\\xi-x)}{\\xi-x} = E\n$$\nThis holds for $\\xi \\neq x$. The integral is well-defined.\n\nThe unrenormalized nonlocal strain, $\\varepsilon_{\\alpha}(x)$, is:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\alpha}(x) = \\int_{\\Omega} \\alpha(x,\\xi) \\cdot E \\,d\\xi = E \\int_{\\Omega} \\alpha(x,\\xi) \\,d\\xi = E \\cdot V(x)\n$$\nFor $x \\in [0, \\delta]$, we substitute the expression for $V(x)$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\alpha}(x) = E \\left( \\frac{x+\\delta}{2\\delta} \\right)\n$$\n\nThe renormalized nonlocal strain, $\\varepsilon_{\\tilde{\\alpha}}(x)$, is:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\tilde{\\alpha}}(x) = \\int_{\\Omega} \\tilde{\\alpha}(x,\\xi) \\cdot E \\,d\\xi = E \\int_{\\Omega} \\tilde{\\alpha}(x,\\xi) \\,d\\xi\n$$\nBy construction of the renormalized kernel, the integral $\\int_{\\Omega}\\tilde{\\alpha}(x,\\xi)\\,d\\xi$ is equal to $1$ for all $x \\in \\Omega$. Thus:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\tilde{\\alpha}}(x) = E \\cdot 1 = E\n$$\nThis confirms the affine invariance property: the nonlocal model with the renormalized kernel correctly reproduces a constant strain field.\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R(x) = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\tilde{\\alpha}}(x)}{\\varepsilon_{\\alpha}(x)}$ for $x \\in [0, \\delta]$.\n$$\nR(x) = \\frac{E}{E \\left( \\frac{x+\\delta}{2\\delta} \\right)}\n$$\nAssuming a non-trivial strain state, $E \\neq 0$, we can cancel $E$ from the numerator and denominator. The denominator is non-zero for $x \\ge 0$ and $\\delta > 0$.\n$$\nR(x) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{x+\\delta}{2\\delta}} = \\frac{2\\delta}{x+\\delta}\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the ratio $R(x)$ in terms of $x$ and $\\delta$ for the region $x \\in [0, \\delta]$. This ratio acts as a correction factor that multiplies the unrenormalized strain to obtain the correct strain value near the boundary.",
