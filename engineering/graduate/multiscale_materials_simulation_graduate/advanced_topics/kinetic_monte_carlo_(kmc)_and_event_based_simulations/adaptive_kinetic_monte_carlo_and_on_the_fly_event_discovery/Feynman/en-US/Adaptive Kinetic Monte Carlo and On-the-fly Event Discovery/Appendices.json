            "problem": "Consider a crystalline surface diffusion process encountered during adaptive kinetic Monte Carlo (Kinetic Monte Carlo, KMC) with on-the-fly event discovery. Let a local minimum state $A$ on a potential energy surface be connected to a neighboring minimum state $B$ by a single-index saddle $S$ of the potential energy $U(\\mathbf{r})$. Define the activation barrier $E^\\ddagger_{A\\to B} = U(S) - U(A)$ and the reaction energy $\\Delta E = U(B) - U(A)$. Assume a canonical ensemble at temperature $T$ with rare events separated from fast vibrational equilibration, so that the separation of time scales underlying Transition State Theory (Transition State Theory, TST) applies. Assume that adaptive event discovery locates transition pathways and saddles as needed to populate the KMC event catalog during simulation.\n\nUsing only first-principles reasoning based on (i) the Boltzmann distribution for state populations, (ii) the definition of the TST kinetic flux as the probability per unit time of crossing a dividing surface from $A$ to $B$, and (iii) microscopic reversibility (detailed balance) for thermally activated transitions, determine which of the following statements are correct about the roles of $E^\\ddagger$ and $\\Delta E$ in KMC and thermodynamics:\n\nA. In rare-event dynamics described by Transition State Theory, $E^\\ddagger$ governs the magnitude of the rate constants for $A \\to B$ and $B \\to A$ via the barrier to reaching the dividing surface, while $\\Delta E$ sets the equilibrium population ratio between $A$ and $B$; therefore Kinetic Monte Carlo uses $E^\\ddagger$ to construct event rates and employs $\\Delta E$ only insofar as it constrains forward/backward rates through detailed balance.\n\nB. Replacing $E^\\ddagger$ with $\\Delta E$ in a rate expression is acceptable provided one adjusts the attempt frequency (prefactor) to a sufficiently large value to reproduce observed timescales; thus the exponential sensitivity to barriers can be compensated by appropriate prefactor choices for each event.\n\nC. In on-the-fly event discovery, knowing $\\Delta E$ is sufficient to assign rates to newly discovered events because detailed balance uniquely determines $E^\\ddagger$ from $\\Delta E$ without explicitly locating a saddle; hence saddle searches are not necessary once $\\Delta E$ is known.\n\nD.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe problem requires an analysis based on three principles: Boltzmann statistics, TST, and detailed balance.\n\n1.  **Boltzmann Distribution and Thermodynamics:** At thermodynamic equilibrium, the probability $P(i)$ of a system occupying a state $i$ is related to its free energy $G_i$. The ratio of populations of two states $A$ and $B$ is given by\n    $$ \\frac{P(B)}{P(A)} = e^{-(G_B - G_A) / (k_B T)} = e^{-\\Delta G / (k_B T)} $$\n    where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the temperature. The free energy $G_i = U_i - TS_i$ (approximating enthalpy with potential energy $U_i$) includes entropic contributions $S_i$. The reaction energy $\\Delta E = U(B) - U(A)$ is the potential energy component of the free energy difference $\\Delta G$. Thus, $\\Delta E$ is the primary determinant of the thermodynamic equilibrium ratio, with entropy modifying this through pre-exponential factors in partition functions.\n\n2.  **Transition State Theory and Kinetics:** TST provides an expression for the rate constant $k_{A \\to B}$ of an elementary reaction. The rate is the flux of systems crossing a dividing surface at the saddle point $S$.\n    $$ k_{A \\to B} = \\nu_{A \\to B} e^{-E^\\ddagger_{A\\to B} / (k_B T)} $$\n    Here, $E^\\ddagger_{A\\to B} = U(S) - U(A)$ is the potential energy barrier. The pre-exponential factor, or attempt frequency, $\\nu_{A \\to B}$, accounts for the vibrational dynamics at the minimum $A$ and the saddle $S$. The rate of a reaction is exponentially dependent on the activation barrier $E^\\ddagger$. A high barrier implies a slow (rare) event, irrespective of the overall thermodynamic driving force $\\Delta E$.\n\n3.  **Detailed Balance (Microscopic Reversibility):** At equilibrium, the rate of forward transitions must equal the rate of reverse transitions between any two states:\n    $$ P(A) k_{A \\to B} = P(B) k_{B \\to A} $$\n    This provides a crucial link between thermodynamics (population ratios) and kinetics (rate constants):\n    $$ \\frac{k_{A \\to B}}{k_{B \\to A}} = \\frac{P(B)}{P(A)} $$\n    Substituting the TST and Boltzmann expressions, we get:\n    $$ \\frac{\\nu_{A \\to B} e^{-E^\\ddagger_{A\\to B} / (k_B T)}}{\\nu_{B \\to A} e^{-E^\\ddagger_{B\\to A} / (k_B T)}} = e^{-\\Delta G / (k_B T)} $$\n    Using the potential energy definitions $E^\\ddagger_{A\\to B} = U(S) - U(A)$ and $E^\\ddagger_{B\\to A} = U(S) - U(B)$, we note that $E^\\ddagger_{A\\to B} - E^\\ddagger_{B\\to A} = U(B) - U(A) = \\Delta E$. The rate ratio becomes:\n    $$ \\frac{k_{A \\to B}}{k_{B \\to A}} = \\frac{\\nu_{A \\to B}}{\\nu_{B \\to A}} e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T)} $$\n    Detailed balance thus enforces a strict relationship between the thermodynamics ($\\Delta E$ and entropic terms in the prefactors) and the kinetics ($E^\\ddagger_{A\\to B}$ and $E^\\ddagger_{B\\to A}$). It shows that $\\Delta E$ constrains the *ratio* of forward and backward rates, but does not determine their absolute magnitudes.\n\nWith these principles established, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. In rare-event dynamics described by Transition State Theory, $E^\\ddagger$ governs the magnitude of the rate constants for $A \\to B$ and $B \\to A$ via the barrier to reaching the dividing surface, while $\\Delta E$ sets the equilibrium population ratio between $A$ and $B$; therefore Kinetic Monte Carlo uses $E^\\ddagger$ to construct event rates and employs $\\Delta E$ only insofar as it constrains forward/backward rates through detailed balance.**\n\nThis statement accurately summarizes the distinct roles of $E^\\ddagger$ and $\\Delta E$. The rate of an event in KMC is determined by its activation barrier $E^\\ddagger$. The energy difference $\\Delta E$ relates the forward and backward barriers ($E^\\ddagger_{B\\to A} = E^\\ddagger_{A\\to B} - \\Delta E$) and thus, via detailed balance, the ratio of their rates. This is precisely how these quantities are used in practice: one calculates $E^\\ddagger_{A\\to B}$ via a saddle search, obtains $\\Delta E$ from the minimum energies, and then determines $E^\\ddagger_{B\\to A}$ without a second independent calculation. The statement correctly identifies that KMC is a kinetic simulation method where rates, governed by $E^\\ddagger$, are paramount. **Correct**.\n\n**B. Replacing $E^\\ddagger$ with $\\Delta E$ in a rate expression is acceptable provided one adjusts the attempt frequency (prefactor) to a sufficiently large value to reproduce observed timescales; thus the exponential sensitivity to barriers can be compensated by appropriate prefactor choices for each event.**\n\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. The attempt frequency $\\nu$ in TST is a physically determined quantity related to vibrational frequencies, not an arbitrary fitting parameter. While one could mathematically write $k = \\nu' e^{-\\Delta E/(k_B T)}$, the required prefactor would be $\\nu' = \\nu e^{(E^\\ddagger - \\Delta E)/(k_B T)}$. Since $E^\\ddagger$ can be much larger than $|\\Delta E|$, this would require a prefactor $\\nu'$ that is many orders of magnitude different from the physically meaningful range of $10^{12}-10^{14}$ s$^{-1}$, rendering it unphysical. The exponential dependence on the activation barrier $E^\\ddagger$ is the dominant and most sensitive part of the rate constant and cannot be \"compensated\" away. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. In on-the-fly event discovery, knowing $\\Delta E$ is sufficient to assign rates to newly discovered events because detailed balance uniquely determines $E^\\ddagger$ from $\\Delta E$ without explicitly locating a saddle; hence saddle searches are not necessary once $\\Delta E$ is known.**\n\nThis statement misinterprets detailed balance. Detailed balance provides the constraint $E^\\ddagger_{B\\to A} = E^\\ddagger_{A\\to B} - \\Delta E$. This is one equation with two unknowns ($E^\\ddagger_{A\\to B}$ and $E^\\ddagger_{B\\to A}$). It is impossible to solve for either barrier knowing only $\\Delta E$. The energy of the saddle point, $U(S)$, is an independent feature of the potential energy surface. To find $E^\\ddagger_{A\\to B} = U(S) - U(A)$, one must explicitly locate the saddle point $S$. The entire purpose of computationally expensive saddle search algorithms used in on-the-fly KMC is to find $U(S)$, which is necessary to calculate the rate. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. If $\\Delta E < 0$ (i.e., $B$ is energetically lower than $A$), the transition $A \\to B$ will be fast regardless of the magnitude of $E^\\ddagger$, and Kinetic Monte Carlo should prioritize events based on $\\Delta E$ rather than $E^\\ddagger$.**\n\nThis confuses thermodynamic driving force with kinetic facility. A reaction being thermodynamically favorable ($\\Delta E < 0$) does not imply it is fast. The reaction rate is governed by the activation barrier $E^\\ddagger$. An exothermic reaction can have a very large barrier and thus be extremely slow (e.g., diamond turning into graphite is favorable, but has a huge barrier). KMC is designed to simulate the system's time evolution correctly, which requires selecting events based on their actual rates. Since rates are exponentially dependent on $E^\\ddagger$, KMC must prioritize events with low barriers ($E^\\ddagger$), not those with large negative $\\Delta E$. **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. At finite temperature, the kinetic barrier relevant to rates is the free energy barrier $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$ and the thermodynamic driving force is the free energy difference $\\Delta G$, with both incorporating vibrational entropic contributions; in the harmonic limit often used for solids, these contributions appear in prefactors and partition-function ratios, so using $E^\\ddagger$ in the exponential together with physically computed prefactors yields rate constants consistent with thermodynamic constraints.**\n\nThis statement presents a more rigorous, statistical-mechanical view. The fundamental quantities governing rates and equilibria are indeed free energies ($\\Delta G^\\ddagger$ and $\\Delta G$). The free energy $G = U - TS$ separates the potential energy part ($U$) from the entropic part ($S$). In the harmonic approximation to TST, the rate constant is $k = (\\frac{k_B T}{h} \\frac{Z_S^\\ddagger}{Z_A})$, where $Z$ are partition functions. This can be expressed as $k = \\nu e^{-E^\\ddagger/(k_B T)}$, where the prefactor $\\nu$ contains all the entropic contributions arising from the ratios of vibrational partition functions. This formulation, using the potential energy barrier $E^\\ddagger$ in the exponent and a physically derived prefactor $\\nu$ that includes entropy, is the standard and correct way to apply TST in simulations. It is fully consistent with the thermodynamic constraints imposed by detailed balance. **Correct**.",

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard problem in computational materials science involving Adaptive Kinetic Monte Carlo (AKMC), Transition State Theory (TST), and group theory. All necessary data and definitions are provided. We proceed with the solution in three parts as requested.\n\n### Part 1: Multiplicity Factor $g_{i}$\n\nThe multiplicity factor, denoted by $g_{i}$ for an event type $i$, is the number of distinct microscopic physical events that are considered equivalent by symmetry and are therefore grouped into a single event class in the kinetic Monte Carlo catalog.\n\nTo determine $g_{i}$ for the nearest-neighbor hop along the $x$-direction, we use the orbit-stabilizer theorem. The theorem states that for a group $G$ acting on a set $X$, the size of the orbit of an element $x \\in X$, denoted $|G(x)|$, is given by the ratio of the order of the group to the order of the stabilizer subgroup of $x$: $|G(x)| = |G| / |G_x|$.\n\nThe relevant symmetry group is the residual site-symmetry group $G = C_{2v}$. The problem states this group consists of four elements: the identity $E$, a two-fold rotation $C_{2}$ about the origin, and reflections $\\sigma_{x}$ and $\\sigma_{y}$ across the $x$- and $y$-axes, respectively. The order of the group is $|C_{2v}| = 4$.\n\nThe group action is on the set of possible nearest-neighbor hop events. We can represent the representative event, a hop from the origin $(0,0)$ to the adjacent site at $(a,0)$, by the displacement vector $\\mathbf{v} = (a,0)$. We must find the orbit of this vector under the action of the $C_{2v}$ group. The action of each group element on a point $(x,y)$ is as follows:\n- $E(x,y) = (x,y)$\n- $C_{2}(x,y) = (-x,-y)$\n- $\\sigma_{x}(x,y) = (x,-y)$ (reflection across the $x$-axis)\n- $\\sigma_{y}(x,y) = (-x,y)$ (reflection across the $y$-axis)\n\nApplying these transformations to our representative vector $\\mathbf{v} = (a,0)$:\n- $E(\\mathbf{v}) = (a,0)$\n- $C_{2}(\\mathbf{v}) = (-a,0)$\n- $\\sigma_{x}(\\mathbf{v}) = (a,-0) = (a,0)$\n- $\\sigma_{y}(\\mathbf{v}) = (-a,0)$\n\nThe orbit of $\\mathbf{v}$, $G(\\mathbf{v})$, is the set of all distinct vectors generated by this action:\n$$\nG(\\mathbf{v}) = \\{(a,0), (-a,0)\\}\n$$\nThe size of the orbit is the number of distinct elements, which is $2$. This is the multiplicity factor $g_{i}$.\n$$\ng_{i} = |G(\\mathbf{v})| = 2\n$$\nThe two microscopic events are the hop to the right (displacement $(a,0)$) and the hop to the left (displacement $(-a,0)$).\n\nAlternatively, using the orbit-stabilizer theorem formally, we first identify the stabilizer subgroup $G_{\\mathbf{v}}$, which consists of all elements $g \\in G$ that leave $\\mathbf{v}$ unchanged ($g(\\mathbf{v})=\\mathbf{v}$). From our analysis above, these elements are $E$ and $\\sigma_{x}$.\n$$\nG_{\\mathbf{v}} = \\{E, \\sigma_{x}\\}\n$$\nThe order of the stabilizer is $|G_{\\mathbf{v}}| = 2$.\nApplying the theorem:\n$$\ng_{i} = |G(\\mathbf{v})| = \\frac{|C_{2v}|}{|G_{\\mathbf{v}}|} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n$$\nThis confirms the result. The multiplicity factor for the event type \"hop along the $x$-direction\" is $2$.\n\n### Part 2: Effective Selection Rate\n\nThe simulation framework is a continuous-time Markov jump process. In such a process, the system resides in a state until a stochastic event causes it to transition to a new state. Each possible microscopic event $j$ has an associated rate (or hazard) $k_{j}$. The total rate of exiting the current state is the sum of all individual microscopic rates, $K_{total} = \\sum_{j} k_{j}$. The time to the next event is drawn from an exponential distribution with parameter $K_{total}$.\n\nHarmonic Transition State Theory (TST) provides an expression for the rate of a single microscopic activated event $i$:\n$$\nk_{i} = \\nu_{i} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{i}}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\nu_{i}$ is the attempt frequency, $E_{i}$ is the activation energy barrier, $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nIn an AKMC simulation, symmetry-equivalent microscopic events are grouped into a single event type or class. The effective selection rate of an event type, which we can denote $K_{\\text{type}}$, is the total contribution of all microscopic events within that class to the total rate of escape. This is simply the sum of the rates of all the constituent microscopic events.\n\nFor the event type \"hop along the $x$-direction\", we found in Part 1 that it comprises $g_{i}=2$ microscopic events: hop right and hop left. The problem states that these are symmetry-equivalent, meaning they share the same activation barrier $E_{i}$ and prefactor $\\nu_{i}$. Therefore, their individual rates are identical:\n$$\nk_{\\text{right}} = k_{\\text{left}} = k_{i} = \\nu_{i} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{i}}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nThe effective selection rate for this event type, let's call it $K_{x}$, is the sum of these individual rates:\n$$\nK_{x} = k_{\\text{right}} + k_{\\text{left}} = k_{i} + k_{i} = 2k_{i}\n$$\nMore generally, for an event type composed of $g_{i}$ symmetry-equivalent microscopic events each with rate $k_{i}$, the effective rate is:\n$$\nK_{\\text{type}} = g_{i} k_{i}\n$$\nSubstituting the TST expression, the effective selection rate for the $x$-direction hop event type is:\n$$\nK_{x} = g_{i} \\nu_{i} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{i}}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\n\n### Part 3: Numerical Computation\n\nWe are asked to compute the numerical value of the effective rate $K_{x}$ using the derived formula and the given parameters.\nThe formula is:\n$$\nK_{x} = g_{i} \\nu_{i} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{i}}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nThe given values are:\n- Multiplicity $g_{i} = 2$ (from Part 1)\n- Attempt frequency $\\nu_{i} = 1.0 \\times 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- Activation energy $E_{i} = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n- Absolute temperature $T = 350\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- Boltzmann constant $k_{B} = 8.617333262145 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV\\,K^{-1}}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the product of the Boltzmann constant and temperature, which represents the thermal energy:\n$$\nk_{B}T = (8.617333262145 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (350\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 0.030160666\\,\\mathrm{eV}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the argument of the exponential function. This is a dimensionless quantity as the units of energy cancel:\n$$\n\\frac{E_{i}}{k_{B}T} = \\frac{0.25\\,\\mathrm{eV}}{0.030160666\\,\\mathrm{eV}} \\approx 8.28890\n$$\nNow we can compute the exponential term:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{i}}{k_{B}T}\\right) = \\exp(-8.28890) \\approx 2.51283 \\times 10^{-4}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute all the values back into the expression for the effective rate $K_{x}$:\n$$\nK_{x} = (2) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (2.51283 \\times 10^{-4})\n$$\n$$\nK_{x} \\approx 5.02566 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nK_{x} \\approx 5.03 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$",

            "solution": "The problem asks for an analysis of the error incurred when reusing a cataloged transition rate in an adaptive kinetic Monte Carlo (AKMC) simulation. The problem is divided into two parts: (a) deriving a worst-case error bound and an acceptance criterion, and (b) calculating the expected error under a statistical model.\n\nFirst, we formalize the relative rate error, $r(\\boldsymbol{\\phi})$. The true rate is given by Harmonic Transition State Theory (HTST) as $k(\\boldsymbol{\\phi}) = \\nu(\\boldsymbol{\\phi})\\exp(-\\beta E_{b}(\\boldsymbol{\\phi}))$, where $\\beta = 1/(k_{B}T)$. The cataloged rate, which is an approximation, is $k^{\\mathrm{cat}}(\\boldsymbol{\\phi}) = \\nu^{\\star}\\exp(-\\beta E_{b}^{\\star})$. The problem states that for the local neighborhood of interest, the prefactor can be considered constant, i.e., $\\nu(\\boldsymbol{\\phi}) \\approx \\nu^{\\star}$.\n\nUsing this approximation, the relative rate error $r(\\boldsymbol{\\phi})$ is:\n$$\nr(\\boldsymbol{\\phi}) = \\frac{|k(\\boldsymbol{\\phi}) - k^{\\mathrm{cat}}(\\boldsymbol{\\phi})|}{k(\\boldsymbol{\\phi})} \\approx \\frac{|\\nu^{\\star}\\exp(-\\beta E_{b}(\\boldsymbol{\\phi})) - \\nu^{\\star}\\exp(-\\beta E_{b}^{\\star})|}{\\nu^{\\star}\\exp(-\\beta E_{b}(\\boldsymbol{\\phi}))}\n$$\nThe prefactor $\\nu^{\\star}$ cancels out:\n$$\nr(\\boldsymbol{\\phi}) \\approx \\frac{|\\exp(-\\beta E_{b}(\\boldsymbol{\\phi})) - \\exp(-\\beta E_{b}^{\\star})|}{\\exp(-\\beta E_{b}(\\boldsymbol{\\phi}))} = |1 - \\exp(-\\beta (E_{b}^{\\star} - E_{b}(\\boldsymbol{\\phi})))|\n$$\nLet us define the barrier mismatch as $\\Delta E_{b}(\\boldsymbol{\\phi}) \\equiv E_{b}^{\\star} - E_{b}(\\boldsymbol{\\phi})$. The relative error is then succinctly expressed as:\n$$\nr(\\boldsymbol{\\phi}) \\approx |1 - \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta E_{b}(\\boldsymbol{\\phi}))|\n$$\n\n(a) Derivation of the worst-case error bound and acceptance rule.\n\nThe problem states that the activation barrier is Lipschitz in the metric $d \\equiv d(\\boldsymbol{\\phi}, \\boldsymbol{\\phi}^{\\star})$, which implies:\n$$\n|E_{b}(\\boldsymbol{\\phi}) - E_{b}^{\\star}| \\leq L d\n$$\nIn terms of our defined mismatch $\\Delta E_{b}(\\boldsymbol{\\phi})$, this is equivalent to $|\\Delta E_{b}(\\boldsymbol{\\phi})| \\leq L d$, or $-L d \\leq \\Delta E_{b}(\\boldsymbol{\\phi}) \\leq L d$.\n\nTo find the worst-case error $r_{\\max}(d)$, we must maximize the function $f(x) = |1 - \\exp(-\\beta x)|$ over the interval $x \\in [-L d, L d]$. The behavior of this function depends on the sign of $x$.\n- If $x > 0$, $f(x) = 1 - \\exp(-\\beta x)$. Since $\\beta > 0$, $f(x)$ is an increasing function of $x$.\n- If $x < 0$, $f(x) = \\exp(-\\beta x) - 1$. Since $\\beta > 0$, $f(x)$ is a decreasing function of $x$.\nThe function $f(x)$ is an even function of $x$ at first glance, but it's not. Let's check the endpoints of the interval $[-L d, L d]$.\nAt $x = L d$: $r = |1 - \\exp(-\\beta L d)| = 1 - \\exp(-\\beta L d)$ (since $\\beta L d \\ge 0$).\nAt $x = -L d$: $r = |1 - \\exp(-\\beta (-L d))| = |1 - \\exp(\\beta L d)| = \\exp(\\beta L d) - 1$ (since $\\beta L d \\ge 0$).\n\nTo determine which value is larger, we compare $\\exp(y) - 1$ and $1 - \\exp(-y)$ for $y = \\beta L d > 0$. Consider the function $g(y) = (\\exp(y) - 1) - (1 - \\exp(-y)) = \\exp(y) + \\exp(-y) - 2$. The derivative is $g'(y) = \\exp(y) - \\exp(-y) > 0$ for $y > 0$. Since $g(0) = 0$, we have $g(y) > 0$ for all $y > 0$. Thus, $\\exp(\\beta L d) - 1 > 1 - \\exp(-\\beta L d)$ for $d > 0$.\n\nThe maximum error occurs when $\\Delta E_{b} = -L d$, which corresponds to the true barrier $E_{b}(\\boldsymbol{\\phi}) = E_{b}^{\\star} + L d$ being maximally higher than the cataloged one. This makes the true rate $k(\\boldsymbol{\\phi})$ very small, leading to a large relative error. The worst-case error bound is:\n$$\nr_{\\max}(d) = \\exp(\\beta L d) - 1\n$$\nTo guarantee that the relative error $r(\\boldsymbol{\\phi})$ is no more than a prescribed tolerance $\\tau \\in (0,1)$, we must enforce the condition on the worst-case error:\n$$\nr_{\\max}(d) \\leq \\tau\n$$\n$$\n\\exp(\\beta L d) - 1 \\leq \\tau\n$$\n$$\n\\exp(\\beta L d) \\leq 1 + \\tau\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n$$\n\\beta L d \\leq \\ln(1 + \\tau)\n$$\n$$\nd \\leq \\frac{\\ln(1 + \\tau)}{\\beta L}\n$$\nThis defines the acceptance rule $d < d_{\\mathrm{thr}}$ with the threshold $d_{\\mathrm{thr}} = \\frac{\\ln(1 + \\tau)}{\\beta L}$.\n\n(b) Computation of the expected relative rate error.\n\nWe are given a statistical model where the barrier mismatch $\\Delta E_{b}$, conditional on the distance $d$, is a random variable uniformly distributed on the interval $[-L d, L d]$. Let $X = \\Delta E_{b}$. The probability density function (PDF) of $X$ is:\n$$\np(x) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{2Ld} & \\text{if } x \\in [-L d, L d] \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe expected relative rate error, $\\mathbb{E}[r \\mid d]$, is the expectation of the function $r(X) = |1 - \\exp(-\\beta X)|$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[r \\mid d] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} r(x) p(x) dx = \\frac{1}{2Ld} \\int_{-Ld}^{Ld} |1 - \\exp(-\\beta x)| dx\n$$\nWe split the integral at $x=0$, as the form of the integrand changes:\n$$\n\\int_{-Ld}^{Ld} |1 - \\exp(-\\beta x)| dx = \\int_{-Ld}^{0} (\\exp(-\\beta x) - 1) dx + \\int_{0}^{Ld} (1 - \\exp(-\\beta x)) dx\n$$\nWe evaluate each integral separately.\nFirst integral:\n$$\n\\int_{-Ld}^{0} (\\exp(-\\beta x) - 1) dx = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\beta}\\exp(-\\beta x) - x \\right]_{-Ld}^{0}\n$$\n$$\n= \\left( -\\frac{1}{\\beta}\\exp(0) - 0 \\right) - \\left( -\\frac{1}{\\beta}\\exp(-\\beta(-Ld)) - (-Ld) \\right) = -\\frac{1}{\\beta} + \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\exp(\\beta L d) - Ld\n$$\nSecond integral:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{Ld} (1 - \\exp(-\\beta x)) dx = \\left[ x + \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\exp(-\\beta x) \\right]_{0}^{Ld}\n$$\n$$\n= \\left( Ld + \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\exp(-\\beta Ld) \\right) - \\left( 0 + \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\exp(0) \\right) = Ld + \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\exp(-\\beta Ld) - \\frac{1}{\\beta}\n$$\nSumming the results of the two integrals:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\exp(\\beta L d) - \\frac{1}{\\beta} - Ld \\right) + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\exp(-\\beta Ld) - \\frac{1}{\\beta} + Ld \\right)\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{\\beta}(\\exp(\\beta L d) + \\exp(-\\beta L d)) - \\frac{2}{\\beta}\n$$\nUsing the definition of the hyperbolic cosine function, $\\cosh(y) = \\frac{\\exp(y) + \\exp(-y)}{2}$, the sum becomes:\n$$\n= \\frac{2}{\\beta}\\cosh(\\beta L d) - \\frac{2}{\\beta} = \\frac{2}{\\beta}(\\cosh(\\beta L d) - 1)\n$$\nFinally, we multiply by the normalization factor $\\frac{1}{2Ld}$ to get the expectation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[r \\mid d] = \\frac{1}{2Ld} \\cdot \\frac{2}{\\beta}(\\cosh(\\beta L d) - 1)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[r \\mid d] = \\frac{\\cosh(\\beta L d) - 1}{\\beta L d}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the expected relative rate error as a function of $d$, $L$, and $\\beta$.",
