In highly symmetric systems like a perfect crystal, many potential atomic movements are physically indistinguishable.

            "problem": "In a monatomic, defect-free bulk Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) crystal with lattice parameter $a$, consider vacancy-mediated diffusion modeled by on-lattice Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC). An elementary event is a nearest-neighbor vacancy-atom exchange. Assume thermally activated dynamics with attempt frequency $\\nu$ and activation barrier $E_{\\mathrm{m}}$, and no external fields or elastic inhomogeneities. Two events are considered symmetry-equivalent if a site-centered point-group operation of the crystal maps one event into the other without changing the local environment. In this ideal bulk setting, this equivalence implies that symmetry-equivalent events share the same rate, $r=\\nu \\exp(-E_{\\mathrm{m}}/k_{B}T)$, and are grouped into a single event type whose multiplicity is the number of symmetry-related realizations at a site. The site symmetry of an FCC bulk site is the full octahedral point group $O_{h}$.\n\nStarting from the fundamental facts that (i) the FCC lattice has coordination number $z=12$ with nearest neighbors along the $\\langle 110\\rangle$ directions, and (ii) energy barriers and attempt frequencies are invariant under the point-group operations of $O_{h}$ in an ideal monatomic crystal, determine the number of distinct nearest-neighbor vacancy hop event types per lattice site and the multiplicity of each type by classifying the nearest-neighbor hop directions into orbits under the action of the site symmetry group. Treat directed hops to different nearest neighbors from the same site as distinct unless related by a site-centered point-group operation.\n\nExpress your final answer as a row matrix containing first the number of distinct event types $N_{\\mathrm{types}}$, followed by the multiplicity $m_{i}$ of each type in any order as $\\left(N_{\\mathrm{types}}, m_{1}, \\ldots, m_{N_{\\mathrm{types}}}\\right)$. No rounding is required. Do not include units in your final answer.",
            "solution": "The problem requires us to determine the number of distinct types of nearest-neighbor vacancy hops in a perfect Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) crystal and the multiplicity of each type. This is to be achieved by classifying the nearest-neighbor displacement vectors into orbits under the action of the site symmetry group.\n\nFirst, we identify the key components of the problem as specified.\nThe crystal is a monatomic, defect-free bulk FCC lattice.\nThe elementary event is a vacancy hop to a nearest-neighbor site.\nThe site symmetry for any atom in this ideal lattice is the full octahedral point group, denoted as $O_h$. This group contains $48$ symmetry operations (rotations, reflections, and inversions) that leave a cube centered at the site invariant.\nThe FCC lattice has a coordination number $z=12$. The vectors pointing from a central atom to its twelve nearest neighbors are along the $\\langle 110 \\rangle$ crystallographic directions.\n\nLet's place a central atom at the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system, $(0,0,0)$. The positions of its $12$ nearest neighbors are given by the set of vectors $S$. For a lattice parameter $a$, these vectors are:\n$$ S = \\left\\{ \\frac{a}{2}[1,1,0], \\frac{a}{2}[-1,-1,0], \\frac{a}{2}[1,-1,0], \\frac{a}{2}[-1,1,0], \\right. $$\n$$ \\left. \\frac{a}{2}[1,0,1], \\frac{a}{2}[-1,0,-1], \\frac{a}{2}[1,0,-1], \\frac{a}{2}[-1,0,1], \\right. $$\n$$ \\left. \\frac{a}{2}[0,1,1], \\frac{a}{2}[0,-1,-1], \\frac{a}{2}[0,1,-1], \\frac{a}{2}[0,-1,1] \\right\\} $$\nEach of these $12$ vectors represents a possible hop direction for a vacancy located at the origin.\n\nThe problem states that two hop events are considered symmetry-equivalent if a site-centered point-group operation maps one to the other. In the context of this problem, this means two hop vectors $v_i$ and $v_j$ from the set $S$ correspond to the same event type if there exists a symmetry operation $g \\in O_h$ such that $g(v_i) = v_j$. The set of all vectors that can be transformed into each other forms an orbit. The number of distinct event types, $N_{\\mathrm{types}}$, is therefore the number of orbits of the set $S$ under the action of the group $O_h$. The multiplicity of each event type, $m_i$, is the size (cardinality) of the corresponding orbit.\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine if the action of the group $O_h$ on the set $S$ is transitive. A group action is transitive if for any two elements $v_i, v_j \\in S$, there is a group element $g \\in O_h$ such that $g(v_i) = v_j$. If the action is transitive, there is only one orbit, which contains all $12$ vectors.\n\nThe problem statement provides the crucial physical insight: \"in this ideal bulk setting, this equivalence implies that symmetry-equivalent events share the same rate\". In a perfect, monatomic FCC crystal, the local atomic and electronic environment is identical for all $12$ nearest neighbors. There is no physical distinction between a hop to one nearest-neighbor site versus another. This physical indistinguishability implies that they must all be related by symmetry.\n\nMathematically, we can verify this. The group $O_h$ includes all symmetry operations of a cube. Let's consider a reference vector, for instance, $v_1 = \\frac{a}{2}[1,1,0]$. We need to show that any other vector in $S$ can be obtained by applying an operation from $O_h$ to $v_1$. The common scaling factor $\\frac{a}{2}$ is unaffected by the rotational and reflectional operations of a point group, so we can work with the direction vectors $[1,1,0]$, etc.\n\n1.  To transform $[1,1,0]$ into $[1,0,1]$: We can apply a rotation that permutes the coordinate axes. For example, the operation that maps $(x,y,z) \\to (x,z,y)$ is a reflection through the plane $y=z$, which is a symmetry operation in $O_h$. Applying this to $[1,1,0]$ yields $[1,0,1]$.\n\n2.  To transform $[1,1,0]$ into $[-1,1,0]$: We can apply a $180^\\circ$ rotation about the $y$-axis, which maps $(x,y,z) \\to (-x,y,-z)$, followed by a $180^\\circ$ rotation about the $z$-axis, which maps $(x,y,z) \\to (-x, -y, z)$. A simpler operation is a reflection through the $yz$-plane, which maps $(x,y,z) \\to (-x,y,z)$. This maps $[1,1,0]$ to $[-1,1,0]$ and is an element of $O_h$.\n\n3.  To transform $[1,1,0]$ into $[1,-1,0]$: We can use a reflection through the $xz$-plane, which maps $(x,y,z) \\to (x,-y,z)$. This transforms $[1,1,0]$ to $[1,-1,0]$.\n\nSince the group $O_h$ contains all permutations of the coordinates and all possible sign changes (e.g., $(x,y,z) \\to (\\pm x, \\pm y, \\pm z)$ and their permutations) that preserve a cube, it is possible to transform any vector of the form $(\\pm 1, \\pm 1, 0)$ into any other vector of the same form or any of its permutations, such as $(\\pm 1, 0, \\pm 1)$ or $(0, \\pm 1, \\pm 1)$. All vectors in $S$ have the same squared magnitude, $1^2 + 1^2 + 0^2 = 2$ (in units of $(a/2)^2$), and are thus geometrically equivalent under the full rotational symmetry of the cube.\n\nTherefore, the action of the group $O_h$ on the set $S$ of $12$ nearest-neighbor vectors is transitive. This means that all $12$ hop directions belong to a single-family of symmetry-equivalent events.\n\nConsequently, there is only one orbit.\nThe number of distinct event types is a number of orbits, so $N_{\\mathrm{types}} = 1$.\nThe multiplicity of this single event type is the size of the orbit, which is the total number of elements in the set $S$. Thus, the multiplicity is $m_1 = 12$.\n\nThe total number of nearest neighbor hops from a site is $z=12$. The sum of the multiplicities of all event types must equal this total. In our case, $\\sum_i m_i = m_1 = 12$, which is consistent.\n\nThe final answer is to be expressed as a row matrix $(N_{\\mathrm{types}}, m_1, \\dots, m_{N_{\\mathrm{types}}})$. With $N_{\\mathrm{types}}=1$ and $m_1=12$, this becomes $(1, 12)$.",

This occurs when $(-1)^n = -1$ and $(-1)^m = -1$, which requires both $n$ and $m$ to be odd integers. The coordinates of the minima are $\\left( \\frac{(2k+1)a}{2}, \\frac{(2l+1)a}{2} \\right)$ for $k,l \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. These are the \"on-lattice\" sites.

The potential energy at these maxima is:\n    $$\n    V_{\\text{max}} = V_0\\left[\\cos(2k\\pi) + \\cos(2l\\pi)\\right] = V_0[1 + 1] = 2V_0\n    $$\n\n3.  **Saddle Points (Transition States):** The eigenvalues must have opposite signs ($\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2  0$). This occurs when one integer from $\\{n, m\\}$ is even and the other is odd. These are index-$1$ saddle points. The coordinates are of the form $\\left( ka, \\frac{(2l+1)a}{2} \\right)$ or $\\left( \\frac{(2k+1)a}{2}, la \\right)$ for $k,l \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.

For example, the point $\\left( ka, \\frac{(2l+1)a}{2} \\right)$ shares a $y$-coordinate with a row of minima but its $x$-coordinate, $ka$, does not match the $x$-coordinate of any minimum, $\\frac{(2k'+1)a}{2}$. Thus, the saddle points are not part of the discrete set of adsorption sites and are correctly described as \"off-lattice\" points.\n\nThe lowest activation barrier, $\\Delta E_{\\text{act}}$, for a hop between nearest-neighbor adsorption sites is given by the difference between the saddle point energy and the minimum energy. Consider a hop from a minimum at $\\left(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}\\right)$ to an adjacent minimum at $\\left(\\frac{3a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}\\right)$. The transition state for this hop is the saddle point located geometrically between them at $\\left(a, \\frac{a}{2}\\right)$.
