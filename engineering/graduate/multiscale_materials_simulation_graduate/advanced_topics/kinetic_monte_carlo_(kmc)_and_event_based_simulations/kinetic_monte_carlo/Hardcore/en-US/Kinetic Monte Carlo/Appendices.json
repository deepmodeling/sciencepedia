All provided data are physically plausible and the problem is well-posed, with a clear objective and sufficient information to reach a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe principle of detailed balance requires that at thermodynamic equilibrium, the rate of forward transitions between any two states is equal to the rate of backward transitions. For our two-state system, this is expressed as:\n$$ \\pi_1 r_{12} = \\pi_2 r_{21} $$\nThe equilibrium occupancies $\\pi_1$ and $\\pi_2$ are given by the Boltzmann distribution:\n$$ \\pi_1 = \\frac{\\exp(-E_1 / (k_B T))}{Z} $$\n$$ \\pi_2 = \\frac{\\exp(-E_2 / (k_B T))}{Z} $$\nwhere $Z$ is the partition function $Z = \\exp(-E_1 / (k_B T)) + \\exp(-E_2 / (k_B T))$.

Note that this condition is independent of temperature $T$.\n\nNow, we check if the given parameters satisfy this condition.\nThe difference in activation barriers is:\n$$ E^{\\ddagger}_{12} - E^{\\ddagger}_{21} = 0.6\\ \\mathrm{eV} - 0.5\\ \\mathrm{eV} = 0.1\\ \\mathrm{eV} $$\nThe difference in site energies is:\n$$ E_2 - E_1 = 0.1\\ \\mathrm{eV} - 0\\ \\mathrm{eV} = 0.1\\ \\mathrm{eV} $$\nSince $0.1\\ \\mathrm{eV} = 0.1\\ \\mathrm{eV}$, the given kinetic parameters are already consistent with the thermodynamics, and the system satisfies detailed balance.\n\nThe problem requires us to proceed with the specified enforcement procedure regardless. We must find the new barriers, denoted as $E^{\\ddagger\\prime}_{12}$ and $E^{\\ddagger\\prime}_{21}$, that satisfy two conditions.\nCondition 1: The new barriers must satisfy detailed balance.\n$$ E^{\\ddagger\\prime}_{12} - E^{\\ddagger\\prime}_{21} = E_2 - E_1 = 0.1\\ \\mathrm{eV} $$\nCondition 2: The arithmetic mean of the new barriers must be preserved.\n$$ \\frac{E^{\\ddagger\\prime}_{12} + E^{\\ddagger\\prime}_{21}}{2} = \\frac{E^{\\ddagger}_{12} + E^{\\ddagger}_{21}}{2} $$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$ E^{\\ddagger\\prime}_{12} + E^{\\ddagger\\prime}_{21} = E^{\\ddagger}_{12} + E^{\\ddagger}_{21} = 0.6\\ \\mathrm{eV} + 0.5\\ \\mathrm{eV} = 1.1\\ \\mathrm{eV} $$\nWe now have a system of two linear equations for the two unknowns $E^{\\ddagger\\prime}_{12}$ and $E^{\\ddagger\\prime}_{21}$:\n1. $E^{\\ddagger\\prime}_{12} - E^{\\ddagger\\prime}_{21} = 0.1$\n2. $E^{\\ddagger\\prime}_{12} + E^{\\ddagger\\prime}_{21} = 1.1$\n\nTo solve for $E^{\\ddagger\\prime}_{12}$, we add the two equations:\n$$ (E^{\\ddagger\\prime}_{12} - E^{\\ddagger\\prime}_{21}) + (E^{\\ddagger\\prime}_{12} + E^{\\ddagger\\prime}_{21}) = 0.1 + 1.1 $$\n$$ 2E^{\\ddagger\\prime}_{12} = 1.2 $$\n$$ E^{\\ddagger\\prime}_{12} = 0.6\\ \\mathrm{eV} $$\nTo solve for $E^{\\ddagger\\prime}_{21}$, we substitute the value of $E^{\\ddagger\\prime}_{12}$ back into the second equation:\n$$ 0.6 + E^{\\ddagger\\prime}_{21} = 1.1 $$\n$$ E^{\\ddagger\\prime}_{21} = 1.1 - 0.6 = 0.5\\ \\mathrm{eV} $$\nThe adjusted barriers are $(E^{\\ddagger\\prime}_{12}, E^{\\ddagger\\prime}_{21}) = (0.6\\ \\mathrm{eV}, 0.5\\ \\mathrm{eV})$. As expected, since the original barriers already satisfied detailed balance, the enforcement procedure yields the original barriers.\nThe final answer is the ordered pair of the adjusted barriers.",

A detailed solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe core of a Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulation for a CTMC involves two steps: determining the time increment and selecting which event occurs. This problem focuses on the second step: event selection. The probability $p_i$ of selecting event $i$ is proportional to its rate $k_i$. Specifically, $p_i = k_i / R$, where $R$ is the total rate of all possible events.\n\nThe selection can be performed by generating a single uniform random number $u \\in (0,1)$ and choosing the event $j$ for which the scaled random number $r = u \\cdot R$ falls into the $j$-th interval of a partitioned axis, where the intervals have lengths equal to the rates $k_i$. That is, one finds the index $j$ satisfying:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{j-1} k_i < r \\le \\sum_{i=1}^{j} k_i\n$$\nA linear search to find $j$ takes $O(N)$ time, where $N$ is the number of events. The problem requires an $O(\\log N)$ procedure, which can be achieved with a binary tree of partial sums.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total rate $R$:\n$$\nR = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} k_i = k_1 + k_2 + k_3 + k_4 = 0.1 + 0.4 + 0.2 + 0.3 = 1.0\n$$\n\nNext, we construct the binary tree of partial sums. The leaves of the tree are the individual rates $k_i$. Each parent node stores the sum of the rates of its children.\n-   **Level 0 (Leaves):** The rates are arranged in the specified order:\n    $L_1 = k_1 = 0.1$\n    $L_2 = k_2 = 0.4$\n    $L_3 = k_3 = 0.2$\n    $L_4 = k_4 = 0.3$\n\n-   **Level 1 (Internal Nodes):** We sum adjacent pairs of leaves. Let's call these nodes $N_{12}$ and $N_{34}$.\n    $N_{12} = L_1 + L_2 = k_1 + k_2 = 0.1 + 0.4 = 0.5$\n    $N_{34} = L_3 + L_4 = k_3 + k_4 = 0.2 + 0.3 = 0.5$\n\n-   **Level 2 (Root Node):** The root node is the sum of the Level 1 nodes.\n    $N_{root} = N_{12} + N_{34} = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.0$. As expected, this is the total rate $R$.\n\nThe structure of the resulting tree is as follows:\n-   Root Node: stores the value $1.0$.\n    -   Left Child ($N_{12}$): stores the value $0.5$.\n        -   Left Child ($L_1$): stores the rate $k_1 = 0.1$.\n        -   Right Child ($L_2$): stores the rate $k_2 = 0.4$.\n    -   Right Child ($N_{34}$): stores the value $0.5$.\n        -   Left Child ($L_3$): stores the rate $k_3 = 0.2$.\n        -   Right Child ($L_4$): stores the rate $k_4 = 0.3$.\n\nNow we demonstrate the selection procedure for the given uniform random number $u = 0.73$.\nThe target value for the search is $r = u \\cdot R = 0.73 \\cdot 1.0 = 0.73$.\n\nThe search algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1.  **Start at the Root Node (value $1.0$).**\n    -   Compare the target value $r = 0.73$ with the value of the left child, $N_{12}$, which is $0.5$.\n    -   Since $r > 0.5$, we traverse to the right child, $N_{34}$.\n    -   Before traversing, we must update the target value by subtracting the value of the left branch we skipped: $r' = r - 0.5 = 0.73 - 0.5 = 0.23$.\n\n2.  **At Node $N_{34}$ (value $0.5$).**\n    -   The current target value is $r' = 0.23$.\n    -   Compare $r'$ with the value of this node's left child, $L_3$, which is $k_3 = 0.2$.\n    -   Since $r' > 0.2$, we traverse to the right child, $L_4$.\n    -   Again, we update the target value by subtracting the value of the left branch: $r'' = r' - 0.2 = 0.23 - 0.2 = 0.03$.\n\n3.  **At Leaf Node $L_4$.**\n    -   We have reached a leaf node. The search terminates. The index of this leaf corresponds to the selected event.\n    -   The leaf is $L_4$, which corresponds to the rate $k_4$. Therefore, the selected event is event $4$.\n\nThe final chosen event has the index $i=4$. This result is consistent with a linear search. The cumulative rates are $C_1 = 0.1$, $C_2 = 0.5$, $C_3 = 0.7$, and $C_4 = 1.0$. The target value $r = 0.73$ falls in the interval $(C_3, C_4]$, which corresponds to event $4$. The binary tree search has correctly and efficiently identified the event.",

It presents a standard, well-posed problem in statistical physics, grounded in the fundamental principles of continuous-time Markov processes and diffusion theory. All data and definitions required for a unique solution are provided, and there are no scientific or logical inconsistencies. We shall therefore proceed with a rigorous derivation.\n\nThe objective is to derive the diffusion coefficient, $D$, for a tracer on a two-dimensional square lattice. The dynamics are governed by a continuous-time kinetic Monte Carlo process. We are instructed to use the master-equation generator formalism and the definition of $D$ from the mean-squared displacement (MSD).\n\nThe position of the tracer at time $t$ is denoted by the vector $\\vec{r}(t) = (x(t), y(t))$. The tracer is confined to a square lattice of spacing $a$, so its position can be written as $\\vec{r}_{\\vec{n}} = a\\vec{n}$, where $\\vec{n} = (n_x, n_y)$ is a vector of integers. The tracer starts at the origin at $t=0$, so $\\vec{r}(0) = \\vec{0}$, which implies $x(0)=0$ and $y(0)=0$.\n\nThe diffusion coefficient $D$ in $d=2$ dimensions is defined by the long-time behavior of the MSD:\n$$ \\langle |\\vec{r}(t)|^2 \\rangle \\underset{t \\to \\infty}{\\longrightarrow} 4Dt $$\nThe MSD is given by $\\langle |\\vec{r}(t)|^2 \\rangle = \\langle x(t)^2 + y(t)^2 \\rangle$. Due to the symmetry of the square lattice and the uniform hopping probabilities, the motion in the $x$ and $y$ directions are statistically equivalent. Thus, $\\langle x(t)^2 \\rangle = \\langle y(t)^2 \\rangle$. The MSD can therefore be expressed as:\n$$ \\langle |\\vec{r}(t)|^2 \\rangle = 2\\langle x(t)^2 \\rangle $$\nOur task reduces to calculating the time evolution of $\\langle x(t)^2 \\rangle$.\n\nFor a continuous-time Markov process, the time evolution of the expectation value of any observable $A$ that is a function of the system's state (here, the tracer's position $\\vec{n}$) is governed by the master equation generator, $\\mathcal{L}$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}\\langle A \\rangle = \\langle \\mathcal{L}A \\rangle $$\nThe generator $\\mathcal{L}$ acting on a function $f(\\vec{n})$ is defined by the transition rates $k_{\\vec{n} \\to \\vec{n}'}$:\n$$ (\\mathcal{L}f)(\\vec{n}) = \\sum_{\\vec{n}'} k_{\\vec{n} \\to \\vec{n}'} [f(\\vec{n}') - f(\\vec{n})] $$\nIn this problem, the total escape rate from any site $\\vec{n}$ is $k$. The tracer hops to one of its four nearest neighbors with uniform probability. The four nearest neighbors of $\\vec{n}=(n_x, n_y)$ are $\\vec{n}_{x+} = (n_x+1, n_y)$, $\\vec{n}_{x-} = (n_x-1, n_y)$, $\\vec{n}_{y+} = (n_x, n_y+1)$, and $\\vec{n}_{y-} = (n_x, n_y-1)$. The rate for each specific hop is therefore $k/4$.\n\nLet us choose the observable to be the square of the $x$-coordinate, $A = x^2$. As a function on the lattice, this is $f(\\vec{n}) = (an_x)^2$. We now compute the action of the generator $\\mathcal{L}$ on this function.\n$$ (\\mathcal{L}x^2)(\\vec{n}) = \\frac{k}{4} \\left[ (a(n_x+1))^2 - (an_x)^2 \\right] + \\frac{k}{4} \\left[ (a(n_x-1))^2 - (an_x)^2 \\right] + \\frac{k}{4} \\left[ (an_x)^2 - (an_x)^2 \\right] + \\frac{k}{4} \\left[ (an_x)^2 - (an_x)^2 \\right] $$\nThe last two terms, corresponding to hops in the $y$-direction, are zero because the $x$-coordinate does not change. We are left with:\n$$ (\\mathcal{L}x^2)(\\vec{n}) = \\frac{ka^2}{4} \\left[ (n_x+1)^2 - n_x^2 \\right] + \\frac{ka^2}{4} \\left[ (n_x-1)^2 - n_x^2 \\right] $$\nExpanding the squared terms:\n$$ (n_x+1)^2 - n_x^2 = (n_x^2 + 2n_x + 1) - n_x^2 = 2n_x + 1 $$\n$$ (n_x-1)^2 - n_x^2 = (n_x^2 - 2n_x + 1) - n_x^2 = -2n_x + 1 $$\nSubstituting these back into the expression for $(\\mathcal{L}x^2)(\\vec{n})$:\n$$ (\\mathcal{L}x^2)(\\vec{n}) = \\frac{ka^2}{4} \\left[ (2n_x + 1) + (-2n_x + 1) \\right] = \\frac{ka^2}{4} [2] = \\frac{ka^2}{2} $$\nThe result, $\\mathcal{L}x^2 = \\frac{ka^2}{2}$, is a constant, independent of the position $\\vec{n}$. This is a crucial simplification.\n\nNow we can write the differential equation for the evolution of $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}\\langle x^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\mathcal{L}x^2 \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\frac{ka^2}{2} \\right\\rangle $$\nSince $\\frac{ka^2}{2}$ is a constant, its expectation value is simply itself.\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}\\langle x^2 \\rangle = \\frac{ka^2}{2} $$\nWe integrate this equation from time $t=0$ to a general time $t$:\n$$ \\int_0^t \\frac{d}{dt'} \\langle x^2 \\rangle dt' = \\int_0^t \\frac{ka^2}{2} dt' $$\n$$ \\langle x^2(t) \\rangle - \\langle x^2(0) \\rangle = \\frac{ka^2}{2} t $$\nThe initial condition is that the tracer starts at the origin, so $x(0)=0$ and consequently $\\langle x^2(0) \\rangle = 0$. This gives:\n$$ \\langle x^2(t) \\rangle = \\frac{ka^2}{2} t $$\nUsing the symmetry argument $\\langle y^2(t) \\rangle = \\langle x^2(t) \\rangle$, the total MSD is:\n$$ \\langle |\\vec{r}(t)|^2 \\rangle = \\langle x^2(t) \\rangle + \\langle y^2(t) \\rangle = \\frac{ka^2}{2} t + \\frac{ka^2}{2} t = ka^2 t $$\nFinally, we equate this result with the definition of the diffusion coefficient $D$ in two dimensions:\n$$ 4Dt = ka^2 t $$\nSolving for $D$, we obtain the final result:\n$$ D = \\frac{ka^2}{4} $$\nThis derivation is complete and relies only on the first principles stipulated in the problem statement.",
