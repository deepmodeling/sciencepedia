            "solution": "The problem requires the construction of minimal sets of symmetry-adapted homogeneous strain vectors to determine the full set of independent elastic constants for cubic, hexagonal, and orthorhombic crystal classes from first-principles energy calculations.

Hexagonal Crystals\n\nHexagonal symmetry results in $5$ independent elastic constants: $C_{11}$, $C_{12}$, $C_{13}$, $C_{33}$, and $C_{44}$. Additionally, the in-plane shear constant $C_{66}$ is related to the normal constants by $C_{66} = \\frac{1}{2}(C_{11}-C_{12})$.

This determines $C_{44}$.\n\n4.  **Strain 4: In-plane shear strain on the (001) plane.**\n    Let $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^{(4)} = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, \\delta)$.\n    Energy: $\\frac{\\Delta E}{V} = \\frac{1}{2} C_{66} \\delta^2$.\n    The second derivative yields $C_{66}$. Using the hexagonal symmetry relation $C_{66} = \\frac{1}{2}(C_{11} - C_{12})$, and with $C_{11}$ known from Strain 1, $C_{12}$ can be determined.\n\n5.  **Strain 5: Combined uniaxial strain.**\n    Let $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^{(5)} = (\\delta, 0, \\delta, 0, 0, 0)$.\n    Energy: $\\frac{\\Delta E}{V} = \\frac{1}{2}(C_{11}\\delta^2 + C_{33}\\delta^2 + 2C_{13}\\delta^2)$.\n    The second derivative gives $C_{11} + C_{33} + 2C_{13}$. Since $C_{11}$ and $C_{33}$ are known from Strains 1 and 2, this equation determines $C_{13}$.\n\nThis set of $5$ strains is minimal and sufficient for all $5$ independent constants.\n\n### 3. Orthorhombic Crystals\n\nOrthorhombic crystals have three orthogonal two-fold rotation axes, resulting in $9$ independent elastic constants: $C_{11}$, $C_{22}$, $C_{33}$, $C_{12}$, $C_{13}$, $C_{23}$, $C_{44}$, $C_{55}$, and $C_{66}$. The stiffness matrix is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{C}_{\\text{orthorhombic}} = \\begin{pmatrix}\nC_{11} & C_{12} & C_{13} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\nC_{12} & C_{22} & C_{23} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\nC_{13} & C_{23} & C_{33} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & C_{44} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & C_{55} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & C_{66}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nA minimal set of $9$ strains is needed. We can construct this set by systematically isolating each constant or a simple combination.\n\n**Strains for diagonal terms ($C_{11}, C_{22}, C_{33}, C_{44}, C_{55}, C_{66}$):**\n\n1.  $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^{(1)} = (\\delta, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) \\implies \\frac{1}{V}\\frac{\\partial^2 (\\Delta E)}{\\partial \\delta^2} = C_{11}$\n2.  $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^{(2)} = (0, \\delta, 0, 0, 0, 0) \\implies \\frac{1}{V}\\frac{\\partial^2 (\\Delta E)}{\\partial \\delta^2} = C_{22}$\n3.  $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^{(3)} = (0, 0, \\delta, 0, 0, 0) \\implies \\frac{1}{V}\\frac{\\partial^2 (\\Delta E)}{\\partial \\delta^2} = C_{33}$\n4.  $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^{(4)} = (0, 0, 0, \\delta, 0, 0) \\implies \\frac{1}{V}\\frac{\\partial^2 (\\Delta E)}{\\partial \\delta^2} = C_{44}$\n5.  $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^{(5)} = (0, 0, 0, 0, \\delta, 0) \\implies \\frac{1}{V}\\frac{\\partial^2 (\\Delta E)}{\\partial \\delta^2} = C_{55}$\n6.  $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^{(6)} = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, \\delta) \\implies \\frac{1}{V}\\frac{\\partial^2 (\\Delta E)}{\\partial \\delta^2} = C_{66}$\n\nThese $6$ simple uniaxial and shear strains directly determine the 6 diagonal components of the stiffness matrix.\n\n**Strains for off-diagonal normal terms ($C_{12}, C_{13}, C_{23}$):**\n\n7.  $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^{(7)} = (\\delta, \\delta, 0, 0, 0, 0) \\implies \\frac{1}{V}\\frac{\\partial^2 (\\Delta E)}{\\partial \\delta^2} = C_{11} + C_{22} + 2C_{12}$.

            "solution": "This problem requires a three-part derivation concerning a pure shear deformation in a cubic crystal. We will first construct the strain tensor, then analyze the effect on volume, and finally derive the energy change.\n\nFirst, we construct the small-strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ for the specified shear. A shear in the $y$-$z$ plane with an engineering shear amplitude $\\gamma$ can be described by a displacement field where the displacement in the $y$ direction is a linear function of the $z$ coordinate. We can represent this by the displacement vector field $\\mathbf{u} = (0, \\gamma z, 0)$. The displacement gradient tensor, $\\mathbf{J}$, has components $J_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x_j}$. For this displacement field, the only non-zero component is $J_{yz} = \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial z} = \\gamma$. The small, symmetric strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ is defined as $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{J} + \\mathbf{J}^T)$. The components are therefore:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x_j} + \\frac{\\partial u_j}{\\partial x_i} \\right)\n$$\nThe only non-zero components are $\\varepsilon_{yz} = \\varepsilon_{zy} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\gamma + 0) = \\frac{\\gamma}{2}$. In matrix form, the strain tensor is:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\frac{\\gamma}{2} \\\\ 0 & \\frac{\\gamma}{2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nSecond, we analyze volume conservation. The fractional volume change is given by $\\det(\\mathbf{F}) - 1$, where the deformation gradient $\\mathbf{F}$ is approximated as $\\mathbf{F} \\approx \\mathbf{I} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ for small strains. We use the identity for the determinant:\n$$\n\\det(\\mathbf{I} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) \\approx 1 + \\mathrm{Tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) + \\frac{1}{2}\\left[ (\\mathrm{Tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}))^2 - \\mathrm{Tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^2) \\right] + O(\\gamma^3)\n$$\nFor our strain tensor, the trace is $\\mathrm{Tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) = 0$.

To enforce volume conservation, one must add correcting strain components of order $\\gamma^2$. For example, one could add a normal strain $\\varepsilon_{xx} = \\frac{\\gamma^2}{4}$. However, such corrections only affect the total energy at order $\\gamma^4$ or higher, because their leading energy contribution is proportional to $(\\varepsilon_{xx})^2 \\propto (\\gamma^2)^2 = \\gamma^4$, and cross-terms with the shear strain (e.g., $C_{14}\\varepsilon_{xx}\\varepsilon_{yz}$) are zero by cubic symmetry. Therefore, for calculating the energy change to second order in $\\gamma$, this volume change can be neglected.\n\nThird, we derive the energy change $\\Delta E(\\gamma)$ to second order in $\\gamma$.

Bulk Modulus from the Elastic Stiffness Tensor ($B_{\\text{tensor}}$)**\n\nFor a cubic crystal, the relationship between the stress tensor $\\sigma$ and the strain tensor $\\epsilon$ (in Voigt notation where indices run from $1$ to $6$) is given by Hooke's law:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_1 \\\\ \\sigma_2 \\\\ \\sigma_3 \\\\ \\sigma_4 \\\\ \\sigma_5 \\\\ \\sigma_6 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} C_{11} & C_{12} & C_{12} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ C_{12} & C_{11} & C_{12} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ C_{12} & C_{12} & C_{11} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & C_{44} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & C_{44} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & C_{44} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon_1 \\\\ \\epsilon_2 \\\\ \\epsilon_3 \\\\ \\epsilon_4 \\\\ \\epsilon_5 \\\\ \\epsilon_6 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nHydrostatic pressure $P$ corresponds to a stress state where the normal stresses are equal and the shear stresses are zero: $\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 = \\sigma_3 = -P$, and $\\sigma_4 = \\sigma_5 = \\sigma_6 = 0$. Due to the cubic symmetry, this stress state induces a uniform strain state where the normal strains are equal and the shear strains are zero: $\\epsilon_1 = \\epsilon_2 = \\epsilon_3 = \\epsilon$, and $\\epsilon_4 = \\epsilon_5 = \\epsilon_6 = 0$.\n\nSubstituting this strain state into Hooke's law for any of the normal stress components (e.g., $\\sigma_1$):\n$$\n\\sigma_1 = C_{11}\\epsilon_1 + C_{12}\\epsilon_2 + C_{12}\\epsilon_3 = C_{11}\\epsilon + C_{12}\\epsilon + C_{12}\\epsilon = (C_{11} + 2C_{12})\\epsilon\n$$\nSince $\\sigma_1 = -P$, we have:\n$$\n-P = (C_{11} + 2C_{12})\\epsilon\n$$\nThe bulk modulus is defined by the change in pressure with respect to the fractional volume change, $\\epsilon_V = \\Delta V / V_0$. For small strains, the volumetric strain is the sum of the normal strains: $\\epsilon_V = \\epsilon_1 + \\epsilon_2 + \\epsilon_3 = 3\\epsilon$. Thus, we can write:\n$$\nB = -\\frac{dP}{d\\epsilon_V} = -\\frac{dP}{d(3\\epsilon)} = -\\frac{1}{3}\\frac{dP}{d\\epsilon}\n$$\nFrom the relation $-P = (C_{11} + 2C_{12})\\epsilon$, we find the derivative $\\frac{dP}{d\\epsilon}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{d\\epsilon} = -(C_{11} + 2C_{12})\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the bulk modulus, we obtain the formula for $B_{\\text{tensor}}$:\n$$\nB_{\\text{tensor}} = -\\frac{1}{3} \\left[-(C_{11} + 2C_{12})\\right] = \\frac{C_{11} + 2C_{12}}{3}\n$$\nUsing the provided elastic constants, $C_{11} = 240.0\\,\\text{GPa}$ and $C_{12} = 140.0\\,\\text{GPa}$:\n$$\nB_{\\text{tensor}} = \\frac{240.0\\,\\text{GPa} + 2 \\times 140.0\\,\\text{GPa}}{3} = \\frac{240.0 + 280.0}{3}\\,\\text{GPa} = \\frac{520.0}{3}\\,\\text{GPa}\n$$\nNumerically, this is $B_{\\text{tensor}} \\approx 173.33333333\\,\\text{GPa}$.\n\n**3. Fractional Discrepancy ($\\Delta$)**\n\nThe fractional discrepancy is defined as:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\frac{B_{\\text{energy}} - B_{\\text{tensor}}}{B_{\\text{tensor}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\nB_{\\text{energy}} \\approx 173.83616336\\,\\text{GPa}\n$$\n$$\nB_{\\text{tensor}} = \\frac{520.0}{3}\\,\\text{GPa} \\approx 173.33333333\\,\\text{GPa}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta = \\frac{173.83616336 - \\frac{520.0}{3}}{\\frac{520.0}{3}} = \\frac{173.83616336 - 173.33333333}{173.33333333}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\approx \\frac{0.50283003}{173.33333333} \\approx 0.00290094248\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\n\\Delta \\approx 0.002901\n$$\nThis small discrepancy is expected in practice, as the two computational routes involve different types of calculations (total energy vs. stress response) and may be subject to different numerical approximations (e.g., k-point sampling, basis set choice) or physical approximations (e.g., choice of exchange-correlation functional).",
