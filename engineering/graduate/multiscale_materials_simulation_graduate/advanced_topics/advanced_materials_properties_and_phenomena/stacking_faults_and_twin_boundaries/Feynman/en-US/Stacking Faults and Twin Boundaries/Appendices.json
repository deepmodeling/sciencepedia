The energy contribution from this line segment of length $L_{ij}$ inside the cube is:\n$$E_{\\text{line}, ij} = \\gamma_{\\ell} L_{ij}$$\nwhere $\\gamma_{\\ell}$ is the specific line energy in units of $\\mathrm{J/m}$.\n\nThe total interfacial energy is the sum over all $N_p$ planes and all unique pairs of planes:\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_p} \\gamma_{\\mathrm{tb}} A_i + \\sum_{i=1}^{N_p} \\sum_{j=i+1}^{N_p} \\gamma_{\\ell} L_{ij}$$\nThe interfacial energy density $e$ is this total energy normalized by the volume of the cube, $V=L^3$:\n$$e = \\frac{E_{\\text{total}}}{V} = \\frac{1}{L^3} \\left( \\gamma_{\\mathrm{tb}} \\sum_{i=1}^{N_p} A_i + \\gamma_{\\ell} \\sum_{i<j} L_{ij} \\right)$$\nThe units of $e$ are correctly $\\mathrm{J/m^3}$.\n\n#### 2. Mechanical Strength Increment ($\\Delta \\tau$)\n\nThe strength increment $\\Delta \\tau$ arises from the resistance that the network of twin intersection lines poses to the motion of dislocations. We derive an estimator for $\\Delta \\tau$ based on the principles of dislocation line tension.\n\nConsider a dislocation line moving on its slip plane and encountering a forest of obstacles. Here, the obstacles are the intersection lines of twin boundaries where they pierce the dislocation's slip plane. The average spacing between these pinning points along the dislocation line is denoted by $\\ell_{\\text{obs}}$.\n\nUnder an applied shear stress $\\tau$, a resolved shear force acts on the dislocation. For a segment of length $\\ell_{\\text{obs}}$, this force is:\n$$F_{\\text{app}} = \\tau b \\ell_{\\text{obs}}$$\nwhere $b$ is the magnitude of the Burgers vector.\n\nThis applied force is counteracted by the dislocation's line tension, $T$ (units of $\\mathrm{N}$ or $\\mathrm{J/m}$), which resists the bowing of the dislocation line between the pinning points. The maximum restoring force an obstacle pair can provide occurs when the dislocation bows out into a semicircle, at which point the restoring force is $2T$. The critical condition for the dislocation to break away from the obstacles (the Orowan mechanism) is when the applied force equals this maximum restoring force:\n$$\\Delta\\tau b \\ell_{\\text{obs}} = 2T$$\nThe line tension $T$ is proportional to the shear modulus $\\mu$ and the square of the Burgers vector magnitude, $T \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\mu b^2$. The problem provides a dimensionless factor $\\alpha$ to encapsulate the geometric and interaction-specific details, so we can write the resisting force as $\\alpha' \\mu b^2$. A common and direct model for the strength increment, which incorporates all prefactors into a single parameter $\\alpha$, relates $\\Delta\\tau$ to the obstacle density.\n\nThe density of line defects is given by $\\lambda = L_{\\text{total}}/V$, where $L_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{i<j} L_{ij}$ is the total length of intersection lines per unit volume (units $\\mathrm{m/m^3} = \\mathrm{m^{-2}}$). For a random forest of such lines, the mean spacing $\\ell_{\\text{obs}}$ a dislocation encounters on its slip plane is inversely proportional to the square root of the line density, $\\ell_{\\text{obs}} \\sim 1/\\sqrt{\\lambda}$.\n\nSubstituting this into the force balance equation leads to the widely used Taylor-like hardening relationship:\n$$\\Delta\\tau \\propto \\frac{T}{b \\ell_{\\text{obs}}} \\propto \\frac{\\mu b^2}{b} \\sqrt{\\lambda} = \\mu b \\sqrt{\\lambda}$$\nThe problem provides a dimensionless factor $\\alpha$ which accounts for the constant of proportionality, representing the strength of the obstacles and geometric factors. The resulting estimator for the shear strength increment is:\n$$\\Delta \\tau = \\alpha \\mu b \\sqrt{\\lambda} = \\alpha \\mu b \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i<j} L_{ij}}{V}}$$\nThis formula is dimensionally consistent and grounded in established dislocation theory.\n\n### Algorithmic Design\n\nThe core of the problem involves robust geometric computations: finding the area of a plane clipped by a cube and the length of a line clipped by a cube.\n\n#### 1. Calculation of Plane-Cube Intersection Area ($A_i$)\n\nFor each plane $i$, defined by $\\mathbf{n}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{x} = d_i$, the area of its intersection with the cube $[0,L]^3$ is calculated as follows:\n1.  **Intersection Check**: A plane intersects the cube if and only if the value $d_i$ lies between the minimum and maximum values of the linear function $f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{n}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{x}$ over the cube's vertices. The extrema are $d_{\\min} = \\sum_{k=x,y,z} L \\cdot \\min(n_{ik}, 0)$ and $d_{\\max} = \\sum_{k=x,y,z} L \\cdot \\max(n_{ik}, 0)$. If $d_i < d_{\\min}$ or $d_i > d_{\\max}$ (with a small numerical tolerance), the plane does not intersect the cube, and its area contribution $A_i$ is $0$.\n2.  **Vertex Finding**: If the plane intersects the cube, the intersection is a convex polygon. Its vertices are the points where the plane intersects the $12$ edges of the cube. Each edge can be parameterized. For example, the edge from $\\mathbf{p}_1=(0,0,0)$ to $\\mathbf{p}_2=(L,0,0)$ is $\\mathbf{p}(t) = \\mathbf{p}_1 + t(\\mathbf{p}_2-\\mathbf{p}_1)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$. The intersection with the plane occurs at a parameter value $t = (d_i - \\mathbf{n}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{p}_1) / (\\mathbf{n}_i \\cdot (\\mathbf{p}_2-\\mathbf{p}_1))$. If $t$ is within $[0,1]$, the point $\\mathbf{p}(t)$ is a vertex of the polygon. All such vertices are collected.\n3.  **Area Calculation**: After collecting the unique intersection vertices (typically $3$ to $6$ points), they must be sorted in angular order to define the polygon. This is done by:\n    a.  Computing the centroid $\\mathbf{C}$ of the vertices.\n    b.  Choosing a reference vector in the plane, e.g., $\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{v}_1 - \\mathbf{C}$, where $\\mathbf{v}_1$ is the first vertex.\n    c.  Sorting the other vertices $\\mathbf{v}_k$ based on the angle their vector $\\mathbf{v}_k - \\mathbf{C}$ makes with $\\mathbf{u}$ around the axis $\\mathbf{n}_i$. This angle can be computed using `atan2` on the projections of the vectors onto a 2D basis in the plane.\n4.  Once the vertices $\\mathbf{v}_1, \\dots, \\mathbf{v}_M$ are sorted, the area of the polygon can be calculated by summing the areas of the triangles formed by one vertex (e.g., $\\mathbf{v}_1$), and every two adjacent vertices ($\\mathbf{v}_k, \\mathbf{v}_{k+1}$). The area of a triangle with vertices $A, B, C$ is given by $\\frac{1}{2} \\|(\\mathbf{B}-\\mathbf{A}) \\times (\\mathbf{C}-\\mathbf{A})\\|$. The total area is the sum of these triangle areas.\n\n#### 2. Calculation of Line-Cube Intersection Length ($L_{ij}$)\n\nFor each pair of non-parallel planes $(i, j)$, their intersection is a line. The length of the segment of this line inside the cube is found as follows:\n1.  **Parallelism Check**: The planes are parallel if their normal vectors $\\mathbf{n}_i$ and $\\mathbf{n}_j$ are collinear. This is checked by computing the cross product $\\mathbf{t} = \\mathbf{n}_i \\times \\mathbf{n}_j$. If $\\|\\mathbf{t}\\|$ is smaller than a numerical tolerance, the planes are considered parallel, and their intersection length $L_{ij}$ is $0$.\n2.  **Line Definition**: If not parallel, the normalized cross product $\\hat{\\mathbf{t}} = \\mathbf{t}/\\|\\mathbf{t}\\|$ gives the direction of the intersection line. A point $\\mathbf{p}_0$ on this line must satisfy both plane equations, $\\mathbf{n}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{p}_0 = d_i$ and $\\mathbf{n}_j \\cdot \\mathbf{p}_0 = d_j$. A robust method to find such a point is given by the formula:\n    $$\\mathbf{p}_0 = \\frac{d_i(\\mathbf{n}_j \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{t}}) + d_j(\\hat{\\mathbf{t}} \\times \\mathbf{n}_i)}{\\|\\mathbf{t}\\|}$$\n    The line is then parameterized as $\\mathbf{p}(s) = \\mathbf{p}_0 + s \\hat{\\mathbf{t}}$.\n3.  **Line Clipping (Slab Method)**: The length of the line segment inside the cube is found by intersecting the parametric line with the six planes defining the cube faces ($x=0, x=L$, etc.). For each axis-aligned slab (e.g., $x \\in [0,L]$), we find the interval of the parameter $s$ for which the line is inside the slab. For the $x$-axis, this is found by solving $p_{0x} + s \\hat{t}_x = 0$ and $p_{0x} + s \\hat{t}_x = L$ for $s$. This gives an interval $[s_{x, \\min}, s_{x, \\max}]$. The intersection of these intervals for $x, y, z$, i.e., $[s_{\\text{enter}}, s_{\\text{exit}}] = [\\max(s_{x,\\min}, s_{y,\\min}, s_{z,\\min}), \\min(s_{x,\\max}, s_{y,\\max}, s_{z,\\max})]$, gives the parameter range for the segment inside the cube. The length is $L_{ij} = \\max(0, s_{\\text{exit}} - s_{\\text{enter}})$.\n\n#### 3. Twin Intersection Classification\n\nAs required internally, each pairwise intersection is classified based on the angle $\\theta = \\arccos(\\mathbf{n}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_j)$ between the plane normals, with a small tolerance $\\varepsilon$:\n-   **Parallel**: $\\theta < \\varepsilon$ or $\\theta > \\pi - \\varepsilon$.\n-   **Right**: $|\\theta - \\pi/2| \\le \\varepsilon$.\n-   **Acute**: $0 < \\theta < \\pi/2 - \\varepsilon$.\n-   **Obtuse**: $\\pi/2 + \\varepsilon < \\theta \\le \\pi - \\varepsilon$.\n\nThis classification is performed but does not alter the calculation of $e$ and $\\Delta\\tau$.\n\nBy implementing these algorithms, the total surface area and total intersection line length within the specified cubic volume can be determined, from which the final physical quantities $e$ and $\\Delta\\tau$ are computed for each test case.",
