            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard problem in computational materials science that can be solved using first principles. All necessary data are provided, and the conditions are physically consistent and clearly defined.\n\nThe surface energy, $\\gamma$, at temperature $T=0$, is defined as the excess Gibbs free energy per unit area associated with the creation of a surface. At $T=0$, entropic contributions vanish, and the Gibbs free energy becomes equal to the internal energy, $E$. Therefore, the surface energy is the excess internal energy per unit area of a surface relative to the bulk material.\n$$\n\\gamma = \\frac{E_{\\text{surface}}}{A}\n$$\nwhere $E_{\\text{surface}}$ is the total excess energy and $A$ is the surface area.\n\nFor a slab model as described, the total energy, $E_{\\text{slab}}$, is the sum of the energy of the atoms as if they were in the bulk and the excess energy due to the presence of the two surfaces. The energy of the atoms in the bulk reference state is the number of atoms, $N$, multiplied by the bulk energy per atom, $E_{\\text{bulk}}$.\nThe total excess energy for the entire slab is thus:\n$$\nE_{\\text{excess}} = E_{\\text{slab}} - N E_{\\text{bulk}}\n$$\nThe problem states that the slab is symmetric and thick enough that the two surfaces do not interact. This means the slab has two identical surfaces, each with area $A$. The total surface area created is $2A$. The excess energy is distributed equally between these two surfaces. Therefore, the surface energy $\\gamma$ for one surface is given by:\n$$\n\\gamma = \\frac{E_{\\text{slab}} - N E_{\\text{bulk}}}{2A}\n$$\nBefore calculating the numerical value, we consider the expected sign and magnitude of $\\gamma$. Creating a surface requires breaking the cohesive bonds that hold the atoms together in the bulk crystal. In a metal, these are strong metallic bonds. Breaking bonds is an endoergic process, meaning it requires an input of energy. Consequently, a system with a surface is at a higher energy state than the same number of atoms in the bulk. This implies that $E_{\\text{slab}}$ must be greater (less negative) than $N E_{\\text{bulk}}$, making the numerator $E_{\\text{slab}} - N E_{\\text{bulk}}$ a positive quantity. As the area $A$ is also positive, the surface energy $\\gamma$ must be positive. A negative surface energy would imply that a material could lower its energy by spontaneously increasing its surface area, which is unphysical. The magnitude of $\\gamma$ is related to the cohesive energy of the material (approximately $-E_{\\text{bulk}}$). For metals with cohesive energies of a few eV per atom, typical surface energies are on the order of $1\\,\\text{J m}^{-2}$.\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- Number of atoms, $N = 200$.\n- Total energy of the slab, $E_{\\text{slab}} = -685.000\\,\\text{eV}$.\n- Bulk energy per atom, $E_{\\text{bulk}} = -3.500\\,\\text{eV}$.\n- Area of one surface, $A = 100.00\\,\\AA^2$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the excess energy, $E_{\\text{excess}}$:\n$$\nE_{\\text{excess}} = (-685.000\\,\\text{eV}) - (200 \\times -3.500\\,\\text{eV})\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\text{excess}} = -685.000\\,\\text{eV} - (-700.000\\,\\text{eV})\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\text{excess}} = 15.000\\,\\text{eV}\n$$\nThe total surface area is $2A$:\n$$\n2A = 2 \\times 100.00\\,\\AA^2 = 200.00\\,\\AA^2\n$$\nNow we compute the surface energy $\\gamma$ in units of $\\text{eV}/\\AA^2$:\n$$\n\\gamma = \\frac{15.000\\,\\text{eV}}{200.00\\,\\AA^2} = 0.075000\\,\\frac{\\text{eV}}{\\AA^2}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be in units of $\\text{J m}^{-2}$.

The droplet radius is much smaller than the capillary length, so gravity can be neglected and the droplet assumes a spherical-cap shape. Line tension effects are negligible, and the three-phase contact line is pinned only by the thermodynamic balance of interfacial energies. The total interfacial free energy of the system is the sum of pairwise interfacial energies, written as\n$$\n\\mathcal{F} = \\gamma_{sl} A_{sl} + \\gamma_{sv} A_{sv} + \\gamma_{lv} A_{lv},\n$$\nwhere $A_{sl}$, $A_{sv}$, and $A_{lv}$ are the areas of the solid–liquid, solid–vapor, and liquid–vapor interfaces, respectively, and $\\gamma_{sl}$, $\\gamma_{sv}$, and $\\gamma_{lv}$ are the corresponding interfacial energies per unit area.

            "solution": "The problem statement is critically validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of thermodynamics and surface physics, is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to derive a unique, meaningful solution.\n\nThe system consists of a liquid droplet on a solid surface, surrounded by its vapor. The total interfacial free energy $\\mathcal{F}$ of the system is given by the sum of the energies of the three interfaces:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F} = \\gamma_{sl} A_{sl} + \\gamma_{sv} A_{sv} + \\gamma_{lv} A_{lv}\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma_{ij}$ is the interfacial energy per unit area (or surface tension) and $A_{ij}$ is the area of the solid-liquid ($sl$), solid-vapor ($sv$), and liquid-vapor ($lv$) interface. The system is at equilibrium, and according to the principles of thermodynamics, its free energy must be at a minimum for a given constant droplet volume $V$.\n\nWe are asked to find the equilibrium condition by considering a virtual displacement of the three-phase contact line. Let the droplet have the shape of a spherical cap. The circular contact line has a radius $r$. Let's consider a small, radially outward displacement $dr$ of this contact line. This virtual displacement changes the interfacial areas.\n\nThe change in the solid-liquid area, $A_{sl} = \\pi r^2$, is:\n$$\ndA_{sl} = d(\\pi r^2) = 2\\pi r dr\n$$\nThe total area of the solid surface under consideration is $A_{solid} = A_{sl} + A_{sv}$, which is assumed to be a fixed domain. Therefore, as the solid-liquid interface expands, the solid-vapor interface must contract by the same amount:\n$$\ndA_{sv} = -dA_{sl} = -2\\pi r dr\n$$\nThe change in the liquid-vapor area, $A_{lv}$, is more subtle. The edge of this surface, which is the contact line of circumference $2\\pi r$, moves outward by $dr$. This adds a new strip of area to the liquid-vapor surface. This strip's projection onto the solid plane is an annulus of area $2\\pi r dr$. Since the liquid surface makes a contact angle $\\theta$ with the solid, the actual area of the new liquid-vapor surface created is this projected area divided by $\\sin(\\pi/2 - \\theta) = \\cos\\theta$. Therefore, the change in the liquid-vapor area is:\n$$\ndA_{lv} = (2\\pi r dr) \\cos\\theta\n$$\nThis derivation assumes the virtual displacement is small enough that the overall curvature and contact angle do not change, which is the essence of a variational approach.\n\nThe total change in free energy $d\\mathcal{F}$ resulting from this virtual displacement is:\n$$\nd\\mathcal{F} = \\gamma_{sl} dA_{sl} + \\gamma_{sv} dA_{sv} + \\gamma_{lv} dA_{lv}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the differential areas:\n$$\nd\\mathcal{F} = \\gamma_{sl} (2\\pi r dr) + \\gamma_{sv} (-2\\pi r dr) + \\gamma_{lv} (2\\pi r dr \\cos\\theta)\n$$\nWe can factor out the common term $2\\pi r dr$:\n$$\nd\\mathcal{F} = ( \\gamma_{sl} - \\gamma_{sv} + \\gamma_{lv} \\cos\\theta ) (2\\pi r dr)\n$$\nAt equilibrium, the free energy is at an extremum, so $d\\mathcal{F}$ must be zero for any arbitrary (non-zero) virtual displacement $dr$. This requires the term in the parenthesis to be zero:\n$$\n\\gamma_{sl} - \\gamma_{sv} + \\gamma_{lv} \\cos\\theta = 0\n$$\nRearranging this equation gives the celebrated Young's equation for the equilibrium contact angle:\n$$\n\\gamma_{sv} - \\gamma_{sl} = \\gamma_{lv} \\cos\\theta\n$$\nThis leads to the expression for the cosine of the contact angle:\n$$\n\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\gamma_{sv} - \\gamma_{sl}}{\\gamma_{lv}}\n$$\nThis is the general equilibrium condition determining the contact angle $\\theta$.\n\nNext, we compute the value of $\\theta$ using the provided interfacial energies: $\\gamma_{sv} = 0.50\\,\\text{J/m}^2$, $\\gamma_{sl} = 0.10\\,\\text{J/m}^2$, and $\\gamma_{lv} = 0.072\\,\\text{J/m}^2$. Substituting these values into Young's equation:\n$$\n\\cos\\theta = \\frac{0.50 - 0.10}{0.072} = \\frac{0.40}{0.072}\n$$\n$$\n\\cos\\theta \\approx 5.556\n$$\nThe cosine of a real angle cannot exceed $1$. The result $\\cos\\theta > 1$ indicates that there is no solution for a stable, finite contact angle $\\theta$ in the range $[0, \\pi]$. This represents a limiting case, as mentioned in the problem statement.\n\nThe physical interpretation of this result is tied to the concept of the spreading parameter, $S$, defined as:\n$$\nS = \\gamma_{sv} - \\gamma_{sl} - \\gamma_{lv}\n$$\nThis parameter represents the net free energy change per unit area when a solid surface is covered by a liquid film. If $S > 0$, the free energy of the system is continuously lowered as the liquid spreads.\nIn our case:\n$$\nS = 0.50 - 0.10 - 0.072 = 0.328 \\text{ J/m}^2\n$$\nSince $S > 0$, dropping the liquid onto the surface is thermodynamically highly favorable, and the liquid will spontaneously spread out to cover the solid surface, forming a thin film. This phenomenon is known as **complete wetting**.\n\nIn the regime of complete wetting, there is no equilibrium state with a finite contact angle. The droplet does not form a stable spherical cap. Instead, it spreads until it forms a microscopic or macroscopic film. The macroscopic, observable contact angle in this situation is taken to be zero. Thus, the equilibrium angle is $\\theta = 0^\\circ$.\nThe problem requests the answer in degrees, rounded to three significant figures. The exact answer is $0$, which is an integer. The concept of rounding to a number of significant figures is typically applied to non-terminating decimals or measurements. For an exact value of $0$, it can be considered to have infinite precision. The most scientifically accurate way to state this result is as exactly $0$.",

When the slab has a net dipole moment normal to the surface, the repeated-image vacuum region in PBC can host a uniform electric field. By Gauss’s law and the field energy density, the spurious electrostatic contribution scales with vacuum thickness, which can hinder convergence unless an explicit dipole correction is applied to cancel the field.\n\nStarting from these core principles:\n- The per-surface energy for a slab with two surfaces is obtained by normalizing the slab excess energy by $2A$.\n- The energy of an electric field is given by $U = \\dfrac{\\varepsilon_0}{2} \\int E^2 \\, dV$, so a uniform field in a vacuum region of thickness $L_{\\mathrm{vac}}$ adds a term that grows with $L_{\\mathrm{vac}}$.\n\nImplement a program that, for each provided test case, computes:\n1.
