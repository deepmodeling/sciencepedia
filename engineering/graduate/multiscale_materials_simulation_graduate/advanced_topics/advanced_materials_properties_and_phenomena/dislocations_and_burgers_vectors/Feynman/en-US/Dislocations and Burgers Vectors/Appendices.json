To understand plastic deformation, we must first determine the preferred slip systems—the combination of slip planes and directions—which are dictated by atomic packing and energy minimization. This first-principles exercise  challenges you to identify the most common slip directions in a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) lattice and calculate the magnitude of the corresponding shortest, and therefore most energetically favorable, Burgers vector.",

            "problem": "A crystalline metal with a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) lattice has a conventional cubic cell of lattice parameter $a$, with lattice points at fractional coordinates $(0,0,0)$ and $\\left(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ in the conventional basis. Starting only from the following foundational principles: (i) a slip system consists of a slip plane and a slip direction within that plane, (ii) in a Bravais lattice, a perfect dislocation has a Burgers vector $b$ that is a lattice translation vector and equals the closure failure of a Burgers circuit, and (iii) slip preferentially occurs along crystallographic directions and on planes with high linear and planar atomic densities, do the following. First, identify the common low-resistance slip plane families and slip direction families in a BCC crystal by reasoning from atomic packing arguments applied to the BCC geometry. Denote families using Miller indices, for example ${110}$, ${112}$, ${123}$ for planes and $\\langle 111 \\rangle$ for directions, as appropriate. Second, compute the magnitude of the shortest perfect Burgers vector $b$ permitted by the BCC lattice, relative to $a$, consistent with your identified slip directions. Express your final answer as the dimensionless ratio $b/a$. Do not assume any empirical shortcuts beyond the stated principles. Your final answer must be a single closed-form expression for $b/a$; do not include units and do not use numerical approximations.",
            "solution": "The Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) lattice is a Bravais lattice whose conventional cell contains lattice points at $(0,0,0)$ and $\\left(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ in fractional coordinates relative to the conventional cubic basis vectors of length $a$. By definition, a perfect dislocation has a Burgers vector $b$ that is a lattice translation vector connecting two lattice points.\n\nWe first identify the families of slip directions and planes using atomic packing arguments. Slip is favored along crystallographic directions with high linear atomic density and on planes with high planar atomic density.\n\nFor a BCC lattice, consider the nearest-neighbor geometry. From the lattice point at $(0,0,0)$, the nearest lattice points are at positions displaced by vectors of the form $\\left(\\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\right)a$, which lie along the body diagonals of the cube. The distance to these nearest neighbors is\n$$\n\\left\\| \\left(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}\\right)a \\right\\| \\;=\\; a \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}} \\;=\\; a \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}.\n$$\nThese directions are of the $\\langle 111 \\rangle$ type. Because these connect nearest neighbors and therefore have the highest linear atomic density, the common slip direction family in BCC is $\\langle 111 \\rangle$.\n\nNext, we identify the common low-resistance slip planes by considering planar atomic density. In BCC, the densest planes are not of the ${111}$ type (as in Face-Centered Cubic), because the ${111}$ plane in BCC contains relatively few atoms due to the absence of a lattice point at the face center. Instead, the planes with high planar density include the ${110}$ family, followed by ${112}$ and ${123}$. This can be reasoned by examining the intersection of these planes with the BCC lattice:\n- The ${110}$ plane intersects the conventional cell in a rectangular net that contains a relatively high count of lattice points per unit area, and it contains $\\langle 111 \\rangle$ directions within the plane.\n- The ${112}$ and ${123}$ families also have relatively high planar densities in BCC and likewise contain $\\langle 111 \\rangle$ directions.\n\nTherefore, the commonly observed slip systems in BCC are planes of the ${110}$, ${112}$, and ${123}$ families with directions in the $\\langle 111 \\rangle$ family.\n\nWe now compute the magnitude of the shortest perfect Burgers vector $b$ in BCC. By the definition of a perfect dislocation in a Bravais lattice, $b$ must be a lattice translation vector. The shortest nonzero lattice translation vector in BCC is the vector connecting $(0,0,0)$ to $\\left(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$, which is along a $\\langle 111 \\rangle$ direction and has length\n$$\nb \\;=\\; \\left\\| \\left(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}\\right)a \\right\\| \\;=\\; a \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}.\n$$\nThis is consistent with the notion that perfect dislocations in BCC have Burgers vectors of the $a \\langle 111 \\rangle / 2$ type. Expressed relative to $a$, the dimensionless ratio is\n$$\n\\frac{b}{a} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}.\n$$\nThis ratio is the requested final expression. Note that while other lattice translation vectors exist, such as $a \\langle 100 \\rangle$ of length $a$, they are longer than $a \\langle 111 \\rangle / 2$ because $a > a\\sqrt{3}/2$ for positive $a$. Therefore, $\\langle 111 \\rangle$ with the half-integer components provides the shortest perfect Burgers vector in BCC, and it lies along the same directions identified as the common slip directions, in accordance with the requirement that the Burgers vector be consistent with the slip direction.",

            "problem": "In the context of multiscale materials simulation of dislocation networks, recall that a Burgers vector is defined by the closure failure of a circuit around a dislocation, and that at a node where dislocations meet the vector sum of Burgers vectors is conserved. State this conservation principle, commonly known as Frank’s rule, and apply it to assess an energy-lowering reaction between two face-centered cubic (FCC) perfect dislocations with Burgers vectors $\\mathbf{b}_{1} = \\frac{a}{2}[1\\bar{1}0]$ and $\\mathbf{b}_{2} = \\frac{a}{2}[0\\,1\\bar{1}]$, where $a$ is the lattice parameter.

            "solution": "The problem requires the statement of Frank's rule for Burgers vector conservation and its application to a specific dislocation reaction. Frank's rule states that if a set of dislocations meets at a single point (a node), the vector sum of their Burgers vectors must be zero, provided all vectors are defined as pointing either into the node or out of the node. In this reaction, two dislocations with Burgers vectors $\\mathbf{b}_{1}$ and $\\mathbf{b}_{2}$ combine to form a third dislocation with Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}_{3}$.
