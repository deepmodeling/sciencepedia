            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard application of dimensional analysis within the field of continuum mechanics and materials science. No flaws were identified.\n\nThe objective is to derive the minimal set of independent dimensionless groups governing the relationship between the phase speed $c$ of a compressional wave and the properties of a porous solid: mass density $\\rho$, elastic modulus $E$, porosity $\\phi$, and characteristic length $L$. We will use the Buckingham Pi theorem.\n\nFirst, we identify the relevant variables and their fundamental dimensions in terms of mass ($M$), length ($L$), and time ($T$). There are $n=5$ variables in total.\n1.  Phase speed, $c$: $[c] = L T^{-1}$\n2.  Mass density, $\\rho$: $[\\rho] = M L^{-3}$\n3.  Effective elastic modulus, $E$: $[E] = M L^{-1} T^{-2}$ (since modulus has units of stress, which is force/area)\n4.  Porosity, $\\phi$: $[\\phi] = 1$ (dimensionless, as it is a ratio of volumes)\n5.  Characteristic length, $L$: $[L] = L$\n\nNext, we determine the number of fundamental dimensions, which is $k=3$ (mass $M$, length $L$, and time $T$). According to the Buckingham Pi theorem, the number of independent dimensionless groups, denoted as $\\Pi$ groups, is given by $p = n - r$, where $r$ is the rank of the dimensional matrix. The dimensional matrix for the variables $\\{c, \\rho, E, L, \\phi\\}$ is:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|ccccc}\n & c & \\rho & E & L & \\phi \\\\\n\\hline\nM & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\nL & 1 & -3 & -1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\nT & -1 & 0 & -2 & 0 & 0\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe rank $r$ of this matrix is the number of linearly independent rows or columns. We can find the rank by selecting a submatrix and checking its determinant. The submatrix for $\\{\\rho, E, c\\}$ is:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -3 & -1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & -2 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant is $1((-1)(-1) - (1)(-2)) - 1((-3)(-1) - (1)(0)) + 0 = 1(1+2) - 1(3) = 3 - 3 = 0$. This set is dimensionally dependent. Let's try the set $\\{\\rho, E, L\\}$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -3 & -1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & -2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant is $1(0 - (-2)) - 1(0 - 0) + 0 = 2 \\neq 0$. Therefore, the rank of the dimensional matrix is $r=3$. The number of independent dimensionless groups is $p = n-r = 5-3=2$.\n\nTo construct these two groups, we select $r=3$ repeating variables. The chosen set of repeating variables must be dimensionally independent (i.e., their dimensional submatrix must have rank $3$). Based on the calculation above, the set $\\{\\rho, E, L\\}$ is a valid choice. These variables represent the fundamental physical aspects of the system: mass, stiffness, and geometry. The remaining variables are $c$ and $\\phi$. We will form one $\\Pi$ group for each of these.\n\nThe first dimensionless group, $\\Pi_1$, is formed with the phase speed $c$. The problem specifies that this group should be a dimensionless wave speed.\n$$\n\\Pi_1 = c^1 \\rho^a E^b L^d\n$$\nFor $\\Pi_1$ to be dimensionless, the dimensions on the right-hand side must cancel out. We write the dimensional equation:\n$$\n[ \\Pi_1 ] = M^0 L^0 T^0 = (L T^{-1})^1 (M L^{-3})^a (M L^{-1} T^{-2})^b (L)^d\n$$\nWe equate the exponents for each fundamental dimension:\n- Exponents of $M$: $0 = a + b$\n- Exponents of $L$: $0 = 1 - 3a - b + d$\n- Exponents of $T$: $0 = -1 - 2b$\n\nSolving this system of linear equations:\nFrom the $T$ equation, $2b = -1 \\implies b = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\nFrom the $M$ equation, $a = -b \\implies a = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nFrom the $L$ equation, $d = 3a + b - 1 = 3(\\frac{1}{2}) + (-\\frac{1}{2}) - 1 = \\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0$.\nSubstituting these exponents back into the expression for $\\Pi_1$:\n$$\n\\Pi_1 = c^1 \\rho^{1/2} E^{-1/2} L^0 = c \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho}{E}}\n$$\nThis group represents the ratio of the wave speed $c$ to the characteristic speed of elastic waves in the medium, $\\sqrt{E/\\rho}$. This fulfills the requirement for a dimensionless wave speed.\n\nThe second dimensionless group, $\\Pi_2$, is formed with the remaining variable, $\\phi$ (porosity).\n$$\n\\Pi_2 = \\phi^1 \\rho^a E^b L^d\n$$\nSince $\\phi$ is already dimensionless ($[\\phi]=1$), for $\\Pi_2$ to be dimensionless, the product of the repeating variables must also be dimensionless. Since $\\{\\rho, E, L\\}$ are dimensionally independent, this is only possible if their exponents are all zero.\n$$\n[\\Pi_2] = 1 = (1)^1 (M L^{-3})^a (M L^{-1} T^{-2})^b (L)^d\n$$\nThis requires $a=0$, $b=0$, and $d=0$. Therefore, the second dimensionless group is simply the porosity itself:\n$$\n\\Pi_2 = \\phi\n$$\n\nThe minimal set of independent dimensionless groups governing the system is $\\{\\Pi_1, \\Pi_2\\}$. The functional relationship can be expressed as $f(\\Pi_1, \\Pi_2) = 0$ or $\\Pi_1 = g(\\Pi_2)$, which implies $c \\sqrt{\\rho/E} = g(\\phi)$. This is a physically meaningful result, indicating that the normalized wave speed is a function of the material's porosity. The two derived groups, $\\Pi_1 = c \\sqrt{\\rho/E}$ and $\\Pi_2 = \\phi$, are clearly independent, as one cannot be formed from the other.\n\nThe final minimal set of independent dimensionless groups is $\\{ c \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho}{E}}, \\phi \\}$.",

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe goal is to determine the coefficient $C(\\mu_m, \\mu_i)$ in the expansion of the effective modulus $\\mu^{\\ast}$ for small inclusion area fraction $\\phi$. The problem specifies using the dilute limit approximation, which involves solving for the field around a single inclusion in an infinite domain.\n\nLet the domain be $\\mathbb{R}^2$, with a circular inclusion of radius $a$ centered at the origin. The modulus is $\\mu_i$ for $r<a$ and $\\mu_m$ for $r>a$. The applied far-field condition corresponds to a uniform gradient $e=e_1=(1,0)$, meaning the potential $u(x)$ behaves as $u(x) \\to x_1$ for $|x| \\to \\infty$. In polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, this is $u(r, \\theta) \\to r \\cos(\\theta)$ as $r \\to \\infty$.\n\nSince the material properties are piecewise constant, the governing equation $\\nabla \\cdot (\\mu \\nabla u) = 0$ simplifies to Laplace's equation $\\nabla^2 u = 0$ in both the inclusion ($D_i$) and the matrix ($D_m$). We denote the potential in the matrix as $u_m$ and in the inclusion as $u_i$.\n\nThe general solution to Laplace's equation in polar coordinates, consistent with the far-field condition $u \\to r \\cos(\\theta)$, takes the form:\nFor the matrix ($r > a$):\n$$u_m(r, \\theta) = r \\cos(\\theta) + A r^{-1} \\cos(\\theta)$$\nwhere the first term represents the uniform far-field and the second term is the disturbance due to the inclusion, which must decay as $r \\to \\infty$. We only consider terms with $\\cos(\\theta)$ dependence due to the form of the far-field loading. $A$ is an unknown constant.\n\nFor the inclusion ($r < a$):\n$$u_i(r, \\theta) = B r \\cos(\\theta)$$\nwhere the solution must be regular (finite) at the origin $r=0$. $B$ is another unknown constant.\n\nThe constants $A$ and $B$ are determined by the interface conditions at $r=a$:\n1.  Continuity of displacement (potential): $u_m(a, \\theta) = u_i(a, \\theta)$.\n2.  Continuity of traction (normal component of the flux): $\\mu_m \\frac{\\partial u_m}{\\partial r}(a, \\theta) = \\mu_i \\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial r}(a, \\theta)$.\n\nApplying the first condition:\n$$(a + A a^{-1}) \\cos(\\theta) = B a \\cos(\\theta) \\implies a + \\frac{A}{a} = Ba$$\n(1) $$1 + \\frac{A}{a^2} = B$$\n\nApplying the second condition requires the radial derivatives:\n$\\frac{\\partial u_m}{\\partial r} = (1 - A r^{-2}) \\cos(\\theta)$\n$\\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial r} = B \\cos(\\theta)$\nAt $r=a$:\n$$\\mu_m \\left(1 - \\frac{A}{a^2}\\right) \\cos(\\theta) = \\mu_i B \\cos(\\theta) \\implies \\mu_m \\left(1 - \\frac{A}{a^2}\\right) = \\mu_i B$$\n(2) $$\\mu_m - \\mu_m \\frac{A}{a^2} = \\mu_i B$$\n\nWe now solve the system of two linear equations for $A$ and $B$. Substituting (1) into (2):\n$$\\mu_m - \\mu_m \\frac{A}{a^2} = \\mu_i \\left(1 + \\frac{A}{a^2}\\right)$$\n$$\\mu_m - \\mu_i = \\mu_i \\frac{A}{a^2} + \\mu_m \\frac{A}{a^2} = (\\mu_i + \\mu_m) \\frac{A}{a^2}$$\nSolving for $A$:\n$$A = a^2 \\frac{\\mu_m - \\mu_i}{\\mu_m + \\mu_i}$$\nNow, we find $B$ using equation (1):\n$$B = 1 + \\frac{1}{a^2} \\left(a^2 \\frac{\\mu_m - \\mu_i}{\\mu_m + \\mu_i}\\right) = 1 + \\frac{\\mu_m - \\mu_i}{\\mu_m + \\mu_i} = \\frac{(\\mu_m + \\mu_i) + (\\mu_m - \\mu_i)}{\\mu_m + \\mu_i} = \\frac{2\\mu_m}{\\mu_m + \\mu_i}$$\n\nNext, we relate this microscopic solution to the macroscopic effective modulus $\\mu^*$. The definition of $\\mu^*$ is $\\mu^* e = \\langle \\mu (e + \\nabla w) \\rangle$, where $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle$ denotes the volume average over the unit cell $Y$, and $w$ is the corrector field. In our single inclusion problem, $e+\\nabla w$ corresponds to the total gradient $\\nabla u$.\n$$\\mu^* e = \\frac{1}{|Y|} \\int_Y \\mu(y) \\nabla u(y) \\, \\mathrm{d}y$$\nSince the unit cell has area $|Y|=1$:\n$$\\mu^* e = \\int_Y \\mu(y) \\nabla u(y) \\, \\mathrm{d}y$$\nWe can split the integral over the matrix and the inclusion (denoted by $D_a$):\n$$\\mu^* e = \\int_{Y \\setminus D_a} \\mu_m \\nabla u_m \\, \\mathrm{d}y + \\int_{D_a} \\mu_i \\nabla u_i \\, \\mathrm{d}y$$\nA more standard approach is:\n$$\\mu^* e = \\int_Y \\mu_m \\nabla u \\, \\mathrm{d}y + \\int_{D_a} (\\mu_i - \\mu_m) \\nabla u_i \\, \\mathrm{d}y$$\nFor a large representative volume, the average of the gradient of the total field is the imposed macroscopic gradient, i.e., $\\langle \\nabla u \\rangle = e$. Thus, $\\int_Y \\nabla u \\, \\mathrm{d}y = e |Y| = e$.\nThe first term becomes $\\int_Y \\mu_m \\nabla u \\, \\mathrm{d}y = \\mu_m \\int_Y \\nabla u \\, \\mathrm{d}y = \\mu_m e$.\nSo, we have the approximation:\n$$\\mu^* e \\approx \\mu_m e + \\int_{D_a} (\\mu_i - \\mu_m) \\nabla u_i \\, \\mathrm{d}y$$\nInside the inclusion, the potential is $u_i(x_1, x_2) = B x_1$. The gradient is constant: $\\nabla u_i = (B, 0) = B e_1 = B e$.\nThe integral is then:\n$$\\int_{D_a} (\\mu_i - \\mu_m) (B e) \\, \\mathrm{d}y = (\\mu_i - \\mu_m) B e \\int_{D_a} \\mathrm{d}y = (\\mu_i - \\mu_m) B e |D_a|$$\nThe area of the inclusion is $|D_a| = \\pi a^2 = \\phi$, since $|Y|=1$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\mu^* e$:\n$$\\mu^* e \\approx \\mu_m e + (\\mu_i - \\mu_m) \\phi B e$$\nAs $\\mu^*$ is a scalar, we can factor out the vector $e$:\n$$\\mu^* \\approx \\mu_m + (\\mu_i - \\mu_m) \\phi B$$\nThis gives the first-order approximation in $\\phi$. Now, we substitute the value of $B$ we found:\n$$\\mu^* = \\mu_m + (\\mu_i - \\mu_m) \\phi \\left( \\frac{2\\mu_m}{\\mu_m + \\mu_i} \\right) + o(\\phi)$$\nComparing this with the requested form $\\mu^*(\\phi) = \\mu_m + C(\\mu_m, \\mu_i) \\phi + o(\\phi)$, we can identify the coefficient $C(\\mu_m, \\mu_i)$:\n$$C(\\mu_m, \\mu_i) = (\\mu_i - \\mu_m) \\frac{2\\mu_m}{\\mu_m + \\mu_i}$$\nThis expression can be rearranged as:\n$$C(\\mu_m, \\mu_i) = \\frac{2\\mu_m(\\mu_i - \\mu_m)}{\\mu_i + \\mu_m}$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression for the coefficient.",

The general form of the linear model is:\n$$ y_i = \\beta_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^{p-1} \\beta_j x_{ij} + \\epsilon_i $$\nHere, $\\beta_0$ represents the desired bulk property $y_{\\infty}$, the $\\{x_{ij}\\}$ are the values of the $p-1$ scaling variables for the $i$-th measurement, $\\{\\beta_j\\}_{j=1}^{p-1}$ are the corresponding scaling coefficients, and $\\epsilon_i$ is the random error for the $i$-th measurement. The problem states that $\\epsilon_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_i^2)$, where $\\mathcal{N}$ denotes the normal distribution.\n\nIn matrix notation, for $n$ observations, the model is expressed as:\n$$ \\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{y} = [y_1, \\dots, y_n]^T$ is the $n \\times 1$ vector of observations, $\\mathbf{X}$ is the $n \\times p$ design matrix whose rows are $[1, x_{i1}, \\dots, x_{i,p-1}]$, $\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = [\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_{p-1}]^T$ is the $p \\times 1$ vector of parameters to be estimated, and $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} = [\\epsilon_1, \\dots, \\epsilon_n]^T$ is the vector of independent random errors. The covariance matrix of the errors, $\\text{Cov}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon})$, is a diagonal matrix with entries $\\text{Cov}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon})_{ii} = \\sigma_i^2$.\n\nTo derive a statistically optimal estimator from first principles, we employ the method of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). The probability density function (PDF) for a single observation $y_i$, given the parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$, is:\n$$ f(y_i|\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\sigma_i) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma_i^2}} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{(y_i - (\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta})_i)^2}{2\\sigma_i^2} \\right) $$\nDue to the independence of the observations, the joint likelihood function for the entire dataset $\\mathbf{y}$ is the product of the individual PDFs:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}|\\mathbf{y}) = \\prod_{i=1}^n f(y_i|\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\sigma_i) = \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma_i^2}} \\right) \\exp\\left( -\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{(y_i - (\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta})_i)^2}{\\sigma_i^2} \\right) $$\nMaximizing the likelihood $\\mathcal{L}(\\boldsymbol{\\beta})$ is equivalent to maximizing its logarithm, the log-likelihood $\\ln \\mathcal{L}(\\boldsymbol{\\beta})$:\n$$ \\ln \\mathcal{L}(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = \\text{const} - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( \\frac{y_i - (\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta})_i}{\\sigma_i} \\right)^2 $$\nTo maximize $\\ln \\mathcal{L}(\\boldsymbol{\\beta})$, we must minimize the sum of squared weighted residuals, $\\chi^2$:\n$$ \\chi^2(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i (y_i - (\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta})_i)^2 $$\nwhere the weights are $w_i = 1/\\sigma_i^2$. This is the principle of Weighted Least Squares (WLS). In matrix form, defining a diagonal weight matrix $\\mathbf{W}$ with $W_{ii} = w_i$, the expression becomes:\n$$ \\chi^2(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = (\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T \\mathbf{W} (\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) $$\nTo find the parameter vector $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ that minimizes $\\chi^2$, we differentiate with respect to $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ and set the gradient to zero:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\chi^2}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = -2 \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{y} + 2 \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\mathbf{0} $$\nThis yields the WLS normal equations:\n$$ (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{X}) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{y} $$\nThe solution for the estimated parameters is:\n$$ \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{y} $$\nThis $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ is the maximum-likelihood estimator. The first component, $\\hat{\\beta}_0$, is our estimate for $y_{\\infty}$.\n\nNext, we derive the uncertainty of this estimator. The uncertainty is given by the standard deviations of the parameters, which are the square roots of the diagonal elements of the parameter covariance matrix, $\\text{Cov}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}})$.\n$$ \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{y} = (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} (\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}) = \\boldsymbol{\\beta} + (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} $$\nThe covariance matrix of $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ is $\\text{Cov}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}) = \\mathbb{E}[(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}-\\boldsymbol{\\beta})(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}-\\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T]$. Substituting the expression for $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}-\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$:\n$$ \\text{Cov}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}) = \\mathbb{E}[ ( (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} ) ( ( \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} )^T ] $$\n$$ \\text{Cov}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}) = (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\mathbb{E}[\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^T] \\mathbf{W}^T \\mathbf{X} ((\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{X})^{-1})^T $$\nThe covariance matrix of the errors, $\\mathbb{E}[\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^T]$, is $\\mathbf{W}^{-1}$ by definition. Since $\\mathbf{W}$ is diagonal, $\\mathbf{W}^T = \\mathbf{W}$, and $\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{X}$ is symmetric, so its inverse is also symmetric.\n$$ \\text{Cov}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}) = (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} (\\mathbf{W}^{-1}) \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{X} (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{X})^{-1} $$\n$$ \\text{Cov}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}) = (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{X})^{-1} (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{X}) (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{X})^{-1} $$\n$$ \\text{Cov}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}) = (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{X})^{-1} $$\nThis fundamental result provides the covariance matrix of the estimated parameters. The estimate for the bulk property is $y_{\\infty} = \\hat{\\beta}_0$, and its standard uncertainty is $u(y_{\\infty}) = \\sqrt{\\text{Cov}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}})_{00}}$.\n\nThe algorithm to be implemented is as follows:\n1. For each case, construct the vector of observations $\\mathbf{y}$, the vector of standard errors $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, and the design matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ based on the specified scaling variables.\n2. Construct the diagonal weight matrix $\\mathbf{W}$ with elements $W_{ii} = 1/\\sigma_i^2$.\n3. Compute the matrix $\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{X}$ and the vector $\\mathbf{b} = \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{y}$.\n4. Compute the inverse of $\\mathbf{A}$, which is the covariance matrix: $\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{A}^{-1} = (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{X})^{-1}$.\n5. Calculate the parameter vector estimate: $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = \\mathbf{C} \\mathbf{b}$.\n6. The estimate for the bulk property is the first element of $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$, $y_{\\infty} = \\hat{\\beta}_0$.\n7. The uncertainty in this estimate is the square root of the first diagonal element of $\\mathbf{C}$, $u(y_{\\infty}) = \\sqrt{C_{00}}$.\nThis procedure will be applied to all five test cases.",
