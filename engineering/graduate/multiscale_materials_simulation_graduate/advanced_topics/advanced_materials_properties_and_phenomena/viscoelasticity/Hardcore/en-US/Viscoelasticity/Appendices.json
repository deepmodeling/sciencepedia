This practice begins with the generalized Maxwell model, which represents a material as an elastic spring in parallel with multiple spring-and-dashpot (Maxwell) branches. By solving the governing differential equations for a step-strain input, you will derive the material's overall stress relaxation modulus, $G(t)$. This exercise is fundamental as it demonstrates how to translate a micro-mechanically inspired model into a continuum-level function that is essential for predicting material response and interpreting experimental data.
