The left side simplifies to $s_i(t)\\exp(t/\\tau_i)$.\n\nEvaluating the right side using the sifting property of the Dirac delta function, which states $\\int f(t')\\delta(t')dt' = f(0)$:\n$$\n\\int_{0^-}^{t} G_{i} \\,\\varepsilon_{0}\\,\\delta(t')\\exp\\left(\\frac{t'}{\\tau_i}\\right) dt' = G_{i} \\,\\varepsilon_{0}\\,\\exp\\left(\\frac{0}{\\tau_i}\\right) = G_{i} \\,\\varepsilon_{0}\n$$\nEquating the two sides, we have for $t>0$:\n$$\ns_i(t)\\exp\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau_i}\\right) = G_{i} \\,\\varepsilon_{0}\n$$\nSolving for $s_i(t)$:\n$$\ns_i(t) = G_{i} \\,\\varepsilon_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_i}\\right) \\quad \\text{for } t > 0\n$$\nSince $s_i(t) = 0$ for $t<0$, we can express the solution for all time using the Heaviside function $H(t)$. For $t \\ge 0$, the solution is $s_i(t) = G_{i} \\,\\varepsilon_{0} \\exp(-t/\\tau_i)$.\n\nNow, we can find the total Cauchy stress $\\sigma(t)$ by substituting the expressions for $\\varepsilon(t)$ and $s_i(t)$ into the given formula for $t \\ge 0$:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = G_{\\infty}\\,\\varepsilon(t) + \\sum_{i=1}^{N} s_{i}(t)\n$$\nFor $t \\ge 0$, $\\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_0$.\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = G_{\\infty}\\,\\varepsilon_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^{N} G_{i} \\,\\varepsilon_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_i}\\right)\n$$\nFactoring out $\\varepsilon_0$:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = \\varepsilon_0 \\left( G_{\\infty} + \\sum_{i=1}^{N} G_{i} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_i}\\right) \\right) \\quad \\text{for } t \\ge 0\n$$\nThis expression can be written for all time by multiplying by $H(t)$, yielding the final closed-form expression for $\\sigma(t)$.\n\nThe problem requests a connection to the Boltzmann superposition principle. For a step strain $\\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_0 H(t)$, the linear viscoelastic stress response is given by $\\sigma(t) = G(t) \\varepsilon_0$, where $G(t)$ is the stress relaxation modulus. By comparing this definition with our derived result, we can identify the relaxation modulus for the generalized Maxwell model:\n$$\nG(t) = \\left( G_{\\infty} + \\sum_{i=1}^{N} G_{i} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_i}\\right) \\right) H(t)\n$$\nThis shows the consistency between the internal variable formulation and the integral representation based on the Boltzmann superposition principle.\n\nFor a three-mode spectrum ($N=3$), the formula for stress $\\sigma(t)$ for $t \\ge 0$ is obtained by explicitly writing out the sum:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = \\varepsilon_0 \\left( G_{\\infty} + G_{1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{1}}\\right) + G_{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{2}}\\right) + G_{3} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{3}}\\right) \\right)\n$$\n\nRegarding the units, the formula relates physical quantities. If the moduli ($G_{\\infty}$, $G_i$) are expressed in Pascals ($Pa$) and the strain $\\varepsilon_0$ is dimensionless (as is standard), then the stress $\\sigma(t)$ will be in Pascals.\n\nAn experimental stress relaxation test is the physical realization of the idealized process described. To measure the relaxation modulus $G(t)$, a specimen is subjected to a rapid, near-step uniaxial or shear strain of magnitude $\\varepsilon_0$, which is then held constant. The force $F(t)$ required to maintain this deformation is recorded as a function of time. This force is converted into engineering stress $\\sigma(t)$ by dividing by the initial cross-sectional area of the sample, $\\sigma(t) = F(t)/A_0$. The relaxation modulus is then calculated directly from its definition:\n$$\nG(t) = \\frac{\\sigma(t)}{\\varepsilon_0}\n$$\nThe resulting $G(t)$ vs. $t$ data can be fitted to the model expression $G(t) = G_{\\infty} + \\sum_{i=1}^{N} G_{i} \\exp(-t/\\tau_i)$ to determine the material parameters $\\{G_i, \\tau_i\\}$ and $G_\\infty$.\n\nPractical considerations introduce deviations from this ideal picture:\n1.  **Finite Rise Time**: An infinitely fast step in strain is physically impossible. Any real test has a finite rise time, $t_r$. The strain is applied as a ramp $\\dot{\\varepsilon} = \\varepsilon_0/ t_r$ for $0 < t < t_r$, and is then held constant. This \"smears\" the stress response at short times. The true step-response modulus $G(t)$ cannot be reliably measured for times $t$ on the order of or less than $t_r$. The initial jump in stress predicted by the model, $\\sigma(0^+) = \\varepsilon_0 (G_\\infty + \\sum_i G_i)$, is not observed; instead, the stress ramps up.\n2.  **Instrument Compliance**: The testing apparatus, including load cells and grips, is not infinitely stiff. It deforms elastically under load. This deformation is in series with the sample deformation. As the sample relaxes and the force drops, the instrument's elastic deformation also recovers, which in turn imposes a small, unwanted additional strain on the sample. Thus, the strain on the sample is not perfectly constant, violating the core assumption of the test. This effect is more pronounced for stiff samples and can be corrected for if the machine's compliance is known, but it remains a source of error.\n\nThe final requested answer is the general closed-form expression for $\\sigma(t)$. Using the Heaviside function to ensure $\\sigma(t)=0$ for $t<0$:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = \\varepsilon_{0} \\left( G_{\\infty} + \\sum_{i=1}^{N} G_{i} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{i}}\\right) \\right) H(t)\n$$\nThis expression is the complete solution to the posed problem.",

Since $\\mathbf{W} = \\mathbf{0}$ for this flow, the Jaumann rate simplifies to the material time derivative: $\\overset{\\mathrm{J}}{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}$.\n    The constitutive equation becomes:\n    $$\n    \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{r}}}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = 2G \\mathbf{D}\n    $$\n    The $(1,1)$ component of this tensor equation gives the ODE for $\\sigma_{11}(t)$:\n    $$\n    \\dot{\\sigma}_{11} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{r}}}\\sigma_{11} = 2G D_{11} = 2G\\dot{\\varepsilon}\n    $$\n    This is a linear first-order ODE with constant coefficients. With the initial condition $\\sigma_{11}(0) = 0$, the solution is:\n    $$\n    \\sigma_{11}^{\\mathrm{J}}(t) = 2G\\tau_{\\mathrm{r}}\\dot{\\varepsilon}\\left(1 - e^{-t/\\tau_{\\mathrm{r}}}\\right)\n    $$\n\n2.  **Upper-Convected Rate** ($\\overset{\\nabla}{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}$)\n    The upper-convected rate is defined as $\\overset{\\nabla}{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} - \\mathbf{L}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\mathbf{L}^{\\mathsf{T}}$.\n    The constitutive equation is:\n    $$\n    \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} - \\mathbf{L}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\mathbf{L}^{\\mathsf{T}} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{r}}}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = 2G \\mathbf{D}\n    $$\n    Since $\\mathbf{L}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ are diagonal, their products are simple. The $(1,1)$ component of the term $\\mathbf{L}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} + \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\mathbf{L}^{\\mathsf{T}}$ is $L_{11}\\sigma_{11} + \\sigma_{11}L_{11}^{\\mathsf{T}} = 2L_{11}\\sigma_{11} = 2\\dot{\\varepsilon}\\sigma_{11}$.\n    The ODE for $\\sigma_{11}(t)$ is:\n    $$\n    \\dot{\\sigma}_{11} - 2\\dot{\\varepsilon}\\sigma_{11} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{r}}}\\sigma_{11} = 2G\\dot{\\varepsilon} \\implies \\dot{\\sigma}_{11} + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{r}}} - 2\\dot{\\varepsilon}\\right)\\sigma_{11} = 2G\\dot{\\varepsilon}\n    $$\n    This is also a linear first-order ODE. The solution depends on the term $1 - 2\\tau_{\\mathrm{r}}\\dot{\\varepsilon}$:\n    - If $1 - 2\\tau_{\\mathrm{r}}\\dot{\\varepsilon} \\neq 0$, the solution with $\\sigma_{11}(0)=0$ is:\n      $$\n      \\sigma_{11}^{\\nabla}(t) = \\frac{2G\\dot{\\varepsilon}}{\\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{r}}} - 2\\dot{\\varepsilon}}\\left(1 - e^{-\\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{r}}} - 2\\dot{\\varepsilon}\\right)t}\\right) = \\frac{2G\\tau_{\\mathrm{r}}\\dot{\\varepsilon}}{1 - 2\\tau_{\\mathrm{r}}\\dot{\\varepsilon}}\\left(1 - e^{-(1 - 2\\tau_{\\mathrm{r}}\\dot{\\varepsilon})t/\\tau_{\\mathrm{r}}}\\right)\n      $$\n    - If $1 - 2\\tau_{\\mathrm{r}}\\dot{\\varepsilon} = 0$ (the critical rate $\\dot{\\varepsilon} = 1/(2\\tau_{\\mathrm{r}})$), the ODE simplifies to $\\dot{\\sigma}_{11} = 2G\\dot{\\varepsilon}$. The solution is $\\sigma_{11}(t) = 2G\\dot{\\varepsilon}t$.\n    - The general formula correctly handles the case $\\dot{\\varepsilon} = 0$, yielding $\\sigma_{11}(t)=0$.\n\n3.  **Logarithmic Corotational Rate** ($\\overset{\\log}{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}$)\n    The logarithmic corotational rate is defined as $\\overset{\\log}{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} + \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}^{\\log} - \\boldsymbol{\\Omega}^{\\log}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}^{\\log}$ is the logarithmic spin. This spin tensor represents the rate of rotation of the principal axes of the rate of deformation tensor $\\mathbf{D}$.\n    For the given flow, the tensor $\\mathbf{D}$ is diagonal and constant in time.\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{D} = \\mathrm{diag}(\\dot{\\varepsilon}, -\\dot{\\varepsilon}/2, -\\dot{\\varepsilon}/2)\n    $$\n    The principal axes of $\\mathbf{D}$ are therefore the fixed coordinate axes $x_1, x_2, x_3$. As these axes do not rotate, the logarithmic spin is zero: $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}^{\\log} = \\mathbf{0}$.\n    Consequently, for this specific flow, the logarithmic rate becomes identical to the material derivative: $\\overset{\\log}{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}$. This is the same form as the Jaumann rate for this flow.\n    Therefore, the governing ODE and its solution are identical to those for the Jaumann rate:\n    $$\n    \\sigma_{11}^{\\log}(t) = \\sigma_{11}^{\\mathrm{J}}(t) = 2G\\tau_{\\mathrm{r}}\\dot{\\varepsilon}\\left(1 - e^{-t/\\tau_{\\mathrm{r}}}\\right)\n    $$\nThe derived analytical solutions are implemented for each test case to compute the required values of $\\sigma_{11}(T)$.\n```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the axial Cauchy stress sigma_11(T) for a Maxwell-type\n    viscoelastic solid under uniaxial extension for three different\n    objective stress rates: Jaumann, Upper-Convected, and Logarithmic.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each tuple is (G, tau_r, eps_dot, T)\n    test_cases = [\n        (1.0, 1.0, 0.1, 10.0),  # Case A: subcritical extension\n        (0.5, 2.0, 0.0, 5.0),   # Case B: zero stretch rate\n        (1.0, 1.0, 0.6, 5.0),   # Case C: supercritical for upper-convected\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for G, tau_r, eps_dot, T in test_cases:\n        # 1.
