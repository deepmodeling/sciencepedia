This is due to crack closure, where asperities on the crack faces make contact before the minimum load is reached. This exercise provides a practical method to determine the effective stress intensity factor range, $ \\Delta K_{\\text{eff}} $, by analyzing compliance data from a simulated experiment. By identifying the point where the crack fully opens from a change in the load-displacement response, you will calculate the portion of the loading cycle that actually contributes to crack propagation .",

            "problem": "An edge-cracked metallic plate is being evaluated under cyclic tension within a multiscale framework where microstructural roughness-induced crack closure is inferred from load-line compliance changes. The specimen is a single-edge cracked tension configuration with crack length $a$, width $W$, thickness $B$, and a constant geometry factor $Y$ over the operating range. A clip-gauge measurement of crack-mouth opening displacement (inferred by Digital Image Correlation (DIC)) provides the load-dependent compliance data needed to estimate the opening load.\n\nYou are given:\n- Geometry: $a = 10\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, $W = 50\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, $B = 5\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, $Y = 1.12$.\n- Loading: maximum remote stress $ \\sigma_{\\max} = 120\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$, load ratio $R = \\sigma_{\\min}/\\sigma_{\\max} = 0.10$.\n- Measured crack-mouth opening displacement $\\delta$ as a function of applied tensile load $P$ during the loading portion of the cycle (machine compliance already corrected):\n  - $P = 2\\ \\mathrm{kN}$, $\\delta = 20\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n  - $P = 4\\ \\mathrm{kN}$, $\\delta = 40\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n  - $P = 6\\ \\mathrm{kN}$, $\\delta = 60\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n  - $P = 8\\ \\mathrm{kN}$, $\\delta = 80\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n  - $P = 10\\ \\mathrm{kN}$, $\\delta = 150\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n  - $P = 12\\ \\mathrm{kN}$, $\\delta = 220\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n- Measured fatigue thresholds for the same alloy and environment:\n  - Long-crack threshold $\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{th,L}} = 6.0\\ \\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$.\n  - Small-crack threshold $\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{th,S}} = 4.0\\ \\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$.\n\nUsing linear elastic fracture mechanics, infer the crack opening load $P_{\\mathrm{open}}$ from the compliance change in the $\\delta(P)$ data, convert it to an opening stress $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{open}}$, and then compute the effective stress intensity range $\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ for the given load ratio $R$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM), specifically concerning crack closure phenomena. The problem is well-posed, providing a complete and consistent set of data and a clear objective. The language is objective and unambiguous. The provided numerical values for geometry, loading, and material response are physically realistic for a metallic alloy. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution can be formulated.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three main steps: 1) determine the crack opening load $P_{\\mathrm{open}}$ from the provided load-displacement data, 2) calculate the corresponding opening stress $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{open}}$, and 3) compute the effective stress intensity factor range $\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n\nStep 1: Determine the crack opening load $P_{\\mathrm{open}}$.\nThe crack opening load is identified by a change in the specimen's compliance, $C$, which is the slope of the displacement-load curve, $C = d\\delta/dP$. When the crack is partially closed due to asperity contact, the specimen is stiffer, resulting in a lower compliance. When the crack becomes fully open, the specimen is less stiff, and the compliance increases to a constant higher value. We calculate the incremental compliance from the provided data.\n\nFor loads $P \\le 8~\\text{kN}$:\nThe displacement data points are $(P, \\delta) = (2, 20)$, $(4, 40)$, $(6, 60)$, and $(8, 80)$. The units are kN for $P$ and $\\mu\\text{m}$ for $\\delta$.\nThe slope of this segment is constant:\n$$ \\frac{d\\delta}{dP} = \\frac{(80 - 60)~\\mu\\text{m}}{(8 - 6)~\\text{kN}} = \\frac{20~\\mu\\text{m}}{2~\\text{kN}} = 10~\\mu\\text{m}/\\text{kN} $$\nThis value is consistent for all points from $P=0$ to $P=8~\\text{kN}$.\n\nFor loads $P \\ge 8~\\text{kN}$:\nThe displacement data points are $(P, \\delta) = (8, 80)$, $(10, 150)$, and $(12, 220)$.\nThe slope of this segment is also constant:\n$$ \\frac{d\\delta}{dP} = \\frac{(150 - 80)~\\mu\\text{m}}{(10 - 8)~\\text{kN}} = \\frac{70~\\mu\\text{m}}{2~\\text{kN}} = 35~\\mu\\text{m}/\\text{kN} $$\nChecking with the next interval:\n$$ \\frac{d\\delta}{dP} = \\frac{(220 - 150)~\\mu\\text{m}}{(12 - 10)~\\text{kN}} = \\frac{70~\\mu\\text{m}}{2~\\text{kN}} = 35~\\mu\\text{m}/\\text{kN} $$\nThe compliance changes from a lower value of $10~\\mu\\text{m}/\\text{kN}$ to a higher value of $35~\\mu\\text{m}/\\text{kN}$. The transition point defines the crack opening load. This change occurs precisely at $P = 8~\\text{kN}$. Thus, the crack opening load is:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{open}} = 8~\\text{kN} $$\n\nStep 2: Calculate the crack opening stress $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{open}}$.\nThe remote stress $\\sigma$ is calculated as the applied load $P$ divided by the gross cross-sectional area of the plate, $A = W \\times B$.\nThe area is:\n$$ A = W \\times B = (50~\\text{mm}) \\times (5~\\text{mm}) = 250~\\text{mm}^2 $$\nThe opening stress $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{open}}$ is the stress corresponding to $P_{\\mathrm{open}}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{open}} = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{open}}}{A} = \\frac{8~\\text{kN}}{250~\\text{mm}^2} = \\frac{8000~\\text{N}}{250~\\text{mm}^2} = 32~\\text{N}/\\text{mm}^2 = 32~\\text{MPa} $$\n\nStep 3: Compute the effective stress intensity range $\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\nThe stress intensity factor $K$ is given by the formula $K = \\sigma Y \\sqrt{\\pi a}$. The effective stress intensity range $\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is the part of the loading cycle for which the crack is fully open. It is defined as $\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{eff}} = K_{\\max} - K_{\\mathrm{open}}$. This is applicable because the minimum stress of the cycle, $\\sigma_{\\min}$, is lower than the opening stress $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{open}}$.\nFirst, we find $\\sigma_{\\min}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\min} = R \\times \\sigma_{\\max} = 0.10 \\times 120~\\text{MPa} = 12~\\text{MPa} $$\nSince $\\sigma_{\\min} = 12~\\text{MPa}  \\sigma_{\\mathrm{open}} = 32~\\text{MPa}$, the crack is indeed closed at the minimum load. The effective stress range that drives crack growth is therefore $\\Delta\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\sigma_{\\max} - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{open}}$.\nThe effective stress intensity range is:\n$$ \\Delta K_{\\mathrm{eff}} = (\\sigma_{\\max} - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{open}}) Y \\sqrt{\\pi a} $$\nWe must use consistent units. We will use $\\sigma$ in MPa and $a$ in meters.\n$a = 10~\\text{mm} = 0.01~\\text{m}$.\n$$ \\sigma_{\\max} = 120~\\text{MPa} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{open}} = 32~\\text{MPa} $$\n$$ Y = 1.12 $$\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$ \\Delta K_{\\mathrm{eff}} = (120~\\text{MPa} - 32~\\text{MPa}) \\times 1.12 \\times \\sqrt{\\pi \\times 0.01~\\text{m}} $$\n$$ \\Delta K_{\\mathrm{eff}} = (88~\\text{MPa}) \\times 1.12 \\times \\sqrt{0.01\\pi}~\\text{m}^{1/2} $$\n$$ \\Delta K_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 98.56 \\times \\sqrt{0.0314159...}~\\text{MPa}\\sqrt{\\text{m}} $$\n$$ \\Delta K_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 98.56 \\times 0.177245...~\\text{MPa}\\sqrt{\\text{m}} $$\n$$ \\Delta K_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 17.4728...~\\text{MPa}\\sqrt{\\text{m}} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\Delta K_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx 17.47~\\text{MPa}\\sqrt{\\text{m}} $$",

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) and addresses the well-documented phenomenon of short-crack behavior in fatigue.

The model must smoothly transition between two regimes:\n$1$. The short-crack regime (as crack length $a \\to 0$), where growth is governed by the material's fatigue limit, $\\Delta\\sigma_e$. Growth occurs if the applied stress amplitude $\\Delta\\sigma$ exceeds this limit: $\\Delta\\sigma \\ge \\Delta\\sigma_e$.\n$2$. The long-crack regime (as $a \\to \\infty$), where growth is governed by the long-crack stress intensity factor threshold, $\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{th,long}}$. Growth occurs if the applied stress intensity factor range, $\\Delta K$, exceeds this threshold: $\\Delta K \\ge \\Delta K_{\\mathrm{th,long}}$.\n\nA well-established method to bridge these regimes is the El Haddad-Smith-Topper (EHST) model, which introduces an intrinsic material length scale, $a_0$. This length scale represents the characteristic size of microstructural features that act as inherent flaws. The model postulates that the effective crack length is the sum of the physical crack length $a$ and this intrinsic length $a_0$.\n\nThe driving force for crack growth is then expressed using this effective length, $a+a_0$, and growth is assumed to occur when this modified stress intensity factor reaches the long-crack threshold $\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{th,long}}$. The criterion is:\n$$\nY\\,\\Delta\\sigma\\,\\sqrt{\\pi(a+a_0)} \\ge \\Delta K_{\\mathrm{th,long}}\n$$\nThis single equation must be consistent with both limiting cases. We can determine the intrinsic length $a_0$ by enforcing the short-crack limit.

            "introduction": "Environmentally assisted cracking, such as hydrogen embrittlement, is a critical failure mode where mechanical loads and chemical species act in concert to degrade material toughness. This advanced practice challenges you to construct a fully-coupled chemomechanical model to predict this degradation. You will link the macroscopic stress field near a crack tip to the localized accumulation of hydrogen and then quantify its weakening effect on the material's cohesive strength, ultimately predicting the reduced fracture toughness . This exercise exemplifies the power of multiscale modeling in tackling complex, multiphysics failure phenomena.",

            "problem": "An isotropic elastic steel plate contains a straight through-thickness crack of length much larger than any internal material length. The crack is loaded under Mode I conditions in plane strain, and the environment provides hydrogen at a constant far-field concentration. The goal is to determine the steady-state hydrogen concentration at the crack tip under chemomechanical equilibrium and then predict the reduction in the critical Mode I fracture toughness from a hydrogen-degraded cohesive response.\n\nStart from the following fundamentals:\n- The local chemical potential of interstitial hydrogen in a stressed solid, following the Larché–Cahn framework, is given by $\\mu = \\mu^{0} + R T \\ln c - \\bar{V}_{H} \\sigma_{h}$, where $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $c$ is the local hydrogen atomic fraction (dimensionless), $\\bar{V}_{H}$ is the partial molar volume of hydrogen, and $\\sigma_{h}$ is the hydrostatic stress (positive in tension).\n- At steady state and under isothermal conditions, local equilibrium implies a spatially uniform chemical potential $\\mu$. Hence $c$ must adjust to mechanical fields such that $R T \\ln c - \\bar{V}_{H} \\sigma_{h} = \\text{constant}$.\n- In Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM), the near-tip stress field for Mode I ahead of the crack along $\\theta = 0$ has a tensile normal stress $\\sigma_{yy}(r,0) = \\dfrac{K_{I}}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi r}}$. Under plane strain, the out-of-plane stress is $\\sigma_{zz} = \\nu(\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy})$, so the hydrostatic stress ahead of the tip is $\\sigma_{h}(r) = \\dfrac{1 + \\nu}{3}\\, \\dfrac{K_{I}}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi r}}$, where $\\nu$ is Poisson’s ratio and $K_{I}$ is the Mode I stress intensity factor.\n- In cohesive-zone modeling with a linear softening traction–separation law, the area under the traction–separation curve equals the fracture energy $G_{c} = \\dfrac{1}{2} T_{\\max} \\delta_{f}$, where $T_{\\max}$ is the cohesive strength and $\\delta_{f}$ is the critical separation at which complete decohesion occurs.\n- The plane strain modulus is $E' = \\dfrac{E}{1 - \\nu^{2}}$, where $E$ is Young’s modulus. The Mode I toughness satisfies $K_{Ic}^{2} = E' G_{c}$.\n\nAssume the following scientifically realistic material parameters and boundary conditions:\n- Young’s modulus $E = 210 \\times 10^{9}$, Poisson’s ratio $\\nu = 0.30$, and temperature $T = 300$.\n- Universal gas constant $R = 8.314$.\n- Partial molar volume of hydrogen $\\bar{V}_{H} = 2.00 \\times 10^{-6}$.\n- Far-field hydrogen concentration $c_{\\infty} = 1.50 \\times 10^{-6}$ (dimensionless atomic fraction).\n- Hydrogen-free cohesive parameters: maximum cohesive traction $T_{\\max}^{0} = 3.00 \\times 10^{9}$ and critical separation $\\delta_{f} = 1.33 \\times 10^{-6}$, giving a hydrogen-free fracture energy $G_{c}^{0} = \\dfrac{1}{2} T_{\\max}^{0} \\delta_{f}$ and hydrogen-free toughness $K_{Ic}^{0} = \\sqrt{E' G_{c}^{0}}$.\n- The crack-tip hydrogen concentration is controlled by the near-tip hydrostatic stress evaluated at a physically meaningful inner cutoff position $r_{c} = 3.50 \\times 10^{-6}$, representing the size of the process zone where the elastic singularity is regularized.\n- During environmental exposure, the mechanical field reaches $K_{I} = K_{Ic}^{0}$ before hydrogen-induced decohesion occurs.\n- Hydrogen reduces the cohesive strength locally according to $T_{\\max}(c) = T_{\\max}^{0} \\exp(-\\gamma c)$, with sensitivity parameter $\\gamma = 5.00 \\times 10^{4}$, while $\\delta_{f}$ is unaffected.\n\nTasks:\n1. Using the chemomechanical equilibrium condition, compute the steady-state hydrogen concentration at the crack tip $c_{\\text{tip}} = c(r = r_{c})$.\n2. Using the hydrogen-degraded cohesive strength at the tip, $T_{\\max}(c_{\\text{tip}})$, compute the reduced fracture energy $G_{c}(c_{\\text{tip}}) = \\dfrac{1}{2} T_{\\max}(c_{\\text{tip}}) \\delta_{f}$ and the corresponding reduced Mode I toughness $K_{Ic}(c_{\\text{tip}}) = \\sqrt{E' G_{c}(c_{\\text{tip}})}$.\n\nAnswer specification:\n- Express $c_{\\text{tip}}$ as a dimensionless atomic fraction.\n- Express the toughness in $\\text{MPa}\\sqrt{\\text{m}}$.\n- Round both $c_{\\text{tip}}$ and $K_{Ic}(c_{\\text{tip}})$ to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The user wants to analyze hydrogen-induced degradation of fracture toughness in a steel plate using a chemomechanical model. The problem is approached by combining Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM), a cohesive zone model for fracture, and the Larché–Cahn theory for hydrogen transport in stressed solids.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\nThe following data and models are provided in the problem statement:\n-   **Chemical Potential**: $\\mu = \\mu^{0} + R T \\ln c - \\bar{V}_{H} \\sigma_{h}$\n-   **Equilibrium Condition**: $R T \\ln c - \\bar{V}_{H} \\sigma_{h} = \\text{constant}$\n-   **LEFM Hydrostatic Stress (plane strain, $\\theta=0$)**: $\\sigma_{h}(r) = \\dfrac{1 + \\nu}{3}\\, \\dfrac{K_{I}}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi r}}$\n-   **Cohesive Law and Fracture Energy**: $G_{c} = \\dfrac{1}{2} T_{\\max} \\delta_{f}$\n-   **Toughness-Energy Relation (plane strain)**: $K_{Ic}^{2} = E' G_{c}$, with $E' = \\dfrac{E}{1 - \\nu^{2}}$\n-   **Material Properties**:\n    -   Young's modulus, $E = 210 \\times 10^{9}$ Pa\n    -   Poisson's ratio, $\\nu = 0.30$\n    -   Temperature, $T = 300$ K\n    -   Universal gas constant, $R = 8.314$ J/(mol·K)\n    -   Partial molar volume of hydrogen, $\\bar{V}_{H} = 2.00 \\times 10^{-6}$ m³/mol\n-   **Boundary Conditions**:\n    -   Far-field hydrogen concentration, $c_{\\infty} = 1.50 \\times 10^{-6}$\n    -   Stress intensity factor for equilibrium, $K_{I} = K_{Ic}^{0}$\n-   **Fracture Parameters (Hydrogen-Free)**:\n    -   Cohesive strength, $T_{\\max}^{0} = 3.00 \\times 10^{9}$ Pa\n    -   Critical separation, $\\delta_{f} = 1.33 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n-   **Local Fracture Model Parameters**:\n    -   Process zone cutoff radius, $r_{c} = 3.50 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n-   **Hydrogen Degradation Model**:\n    -   Degraded cohesive strength, $T_{\\max}(c) = T_{\\max}^{0} \\exp(-\\gamma c)$\n    -   Sensitivity parameter, $\\gamma = 5.00 \\times 10^{4}$\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem is based on standard, well-established theories in solid mechanics and materials science: LEFM for stress analysis, cohesive zone modeling for the fracture process, and the Larché–Cahn theory for stress-assisted diffusion. All equations provided are standard representations of these theories. The material parameters and boundary conditions are physically realistic for high-strength steel under typical environmental conditions. The problem is self-contained, providing all necessary information to proceed with a unique solution. The language is objective and technical. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all data are dimensionally consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is **valid**. A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution proceeds in two main parts as requested: first, determining the steady-state hydrogen concentration at the crack tip, and second, calculating the resulting reduction in fracture toughness.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Crack-Tip Hydrogen Concentration, $c_{\\text{tip}}$**\n\nThe calculation requires the hydrostatic stress at the crack tip, which in turn depends on the hydrogen-free fracture toughness, $K_{Ic}^{0}$. We must first compute this value.\n\n1.  **Calculate Hydrogen-Free Properties ($G_{c}^{0}$ and $K_{Ic}^{0}$)**\n    The plane strain modulus, $E'$, is:\n    $$E' = \\frac{E}{1 - \\nu^{2}} = \\frac{210 \\times 10^{9} \\, \\text{Pa}}{1 - (0.30)^{2}} = \\frac{210 \\times 10^{9} \\, \\text{Pa}}{0.91} \\approx 2.3077 \\times 10^{11} \\, \\text{Pa}$$\n    The hydrogen-free fracture energy, $G_{c}^{0}$, is:\n    $$G_{c}^{0} = \\frac{1}{2} T_{\\max}^{0} \\delta_{f} = \\frac{1}{2} (3.00 \\times 10^{9} \\, \\text{Pa}) (1.33 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}) = 1995 \\, \\text{J/m}^2$$\n    The hydrogen-free fracture toughness, $K_{Ic}^{0}$, is then:\n    $$K_{Ic}^{0} = \\sqrt{E' G_{c}^{0}} = \\sqrt{(2.3077 \\times 10^{11} \\, \\text{Pa}) \\times (1995 \\, \\text{J/m}^2)} \\approx 2.1457 \\times 10^{7} \\, \\text{Pa}\\sqrt{\\text{m}}$$\n\n2.  **Calculate Hydrostatic Stress at the Cutoff Radius**\n    The problem states that hydrogen accumulation is driven by the stress field corresponding to $K_{I} = K_{Ic}^{0}$. The hydrostatic stress is evaluated at the process zone boundary $r = r_{c}$:\n    $$\\sigma_{h}(r_{c}) = \\frac{1 + \\nu}{3} \\frac{K_{Ic}^{0}}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi r_{c}}} = \\frac{1 + 0.30}{3} \\frac{2.1457 \\times 10^{7} \\, \\text{Pa}\\sqrt{\\text{m}}}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi (3.50 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m})}}$$\n    $$\\sigma_{h}(r_{c}) \\approx \\frac{1.3}{3} \\frac{2.1457 \\times 10^{7}}{4.6895 \\times 10^{-3}} \\, \\text{Pa} \\approx 1.9827 \\times 10^{9} \\, \\text{Pa}$$\n\n3.  **Calculate Crack-Tip Hydrogen Concentration, $c_{\\text{tip}}$**\n    At chemomechanical equilibrium, the chemical potential $\\mu$ is uniform. We equate the potential at the crack tip ($r = r_{c}$) with the potential in the far-field ($r \\to \\infty$, where $\\sigma_h = 0$):\n    $$\\mu^{0} + R T \\ln c_{\\text{tip}} - \\bar{V}_{H} \\sigma_{h}(r_{c}) = \\mu^{0} + R T \\ln c_{\\infty}$$\n    Rearranging gives the relationship for hydrogen accumulation, often called the stress-driven segregation law:\n    $$c_{\\text{tip}} = c_{\\infty} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\bar{V}_{H} \\sigma_{h}(r_{c})}{R T}\\right)$$\n    We now substitute the known values. The term $RT$ is:\n    $$RT = (8.314 \\, \\text{J/(mol}\\cdot\\text{K)}) \\times (300 \\, \\text{K}) = 2494.2 \\, \\text{J/mol}$$\n    The exponential argument is:\n    $$\\frac{\\bar{V}_{H} \\sigma_{h}(r_{c})}{R T} = \\frac{(2.00 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}^3\\text{/mol}) \\times (1.9827 \\times 10^{9} \\, \\text{Pa})}{2494.2 \\, \\text{J/mol}} \\approx 1.5898$$\n    The crack-tip hydrogen concentration is:\n    $$c_{\\text{tip}} = (1.50 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times \\exp(1.5898) \\approx (1.50 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times 4.9031 \\approx 7.3547 \\times 10^{-6}$$\n    Rounding to three significant figures, we get:\n    $$c_{\\text{tip}} \\approx 7.35 \\times 10^{-6}$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Reduced Fracture Toughness, $K_{Ic}(c_{\\text{tip}})$**\n\n1.  **Calculate Hydrogen-Degraded Cohesive Strength**\n    Using the calculated $c_{\\text{tip}}$ and the given degradation law:\n    $$T_{\\max}(c_{\\text{tip}}) = T_{\\max}^{0} \\exp(-\\gamma c_{\\text{tip}}) = (3.00 \\times 10^{9} \\, \\text{Pa}) \\exp(-(5.00 \\times 10^{4}) \\times (7.3547 \\times 10^{-6}))$$\n    $$T_{\\max}(c_{\\text{tip}}) = (3.00 \\times 10^{9} \\, \\text{Pa}) \\exp(-0.3677) \\approx (3.00 \\times 10^{9} \\, \\text{Pa}) \\times 0.6923 \\approx 2.0769 \\times 10^{9} \\, \\text{Pa}$$\n\n2.  **Calculate Reduced Fracture Energy and Toughness**\n    Since $\\delta_{f}$ is unaffected, the hydrogen-degraded fracture energy $G_{c}(c_{\\text{tip}})$ is:\n    $$G_{c}(c_{\\text{tip}}) = \\frac{1}{2} T_{\\max}(c_{\\text{tip}}) \\delta_{f} = \\frac{1}{2} (2.0769 \\times 10^{9} \\, \\text{Pa}) (1.33 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}) \\approx 1381.1 \\, \\text{J/m}^2$$\n    The corresponding reduced fracture toughness, $K_{Ic}(c_{\\text{tip}})$, is:\n    $$K_{Ic}(c_{\\text{tip}}) = \\sqrt{E' G_{c}(c_{\\text{tip}})} = \\sqrt{(2.3077 \\times 10^{11} \\, \\text{Pa}) \\times (1381.1 \\, \\text{J/m}^2)}$$\n    $$K_{Ic}(c_{\\text{tip}}) \\approx \\sqrt{3.1873 \\times 10^{14}} \\, \\text{Pa}\\sqrt{\\text{m}} \\approx 1.7853 \\times 10^{7} \\, \\text{Pa}\\sqrt{\\text{m}}$$\n    To express the result in units of $\\text{MPa}\\sqrt{\\text{m}}$, we divide by $10^{6}$:\n    $$K_{Ic}(c_{\\text{tip}}) \\approx 17.853 \\, \\text{MPa}\\sqrt{\\text{m}}$$\n    Rounding to three significant figures, we obtain:\n    $$K_{Ic}(c_{\\text{tip}}) \\approx 17.9 \\, \\text{MPa}\\sqrt{\\text{m}}$$\n\nThe final answers are $c_{\\text{tip}} \\approx 7.35 \\times 10^{-6}$ and $K_{Ic}(c_{\\text{tip}}) \\approx 17.9 \\, \\text{MPa}\\sqrt{\\text{m}}$.",
