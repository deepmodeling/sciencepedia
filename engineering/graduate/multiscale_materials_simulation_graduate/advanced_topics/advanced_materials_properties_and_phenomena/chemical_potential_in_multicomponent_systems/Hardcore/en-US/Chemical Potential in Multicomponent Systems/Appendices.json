The alloy’s composition changes isothermally and isobarically from mole fraction $x_{A}=0.2$ to $x_{A}=0.5$, with the system remaining in the ideal solution regime throughout.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definition of chemical potential as a derivative of $G$ and from the ideal solution description of mixing, derive the change in the chemical potential of component $A$ attributable solely to the composition change under these conditions. Assume that any contributions to $G$ that are independent of composition at fixed $T$ and $P$ are identical in the initial and final states.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the change in chemical potential, $\\Delta\\mu_A$, for component $A$ in a binary ideal solution when its mole fraction changes from an initial value $x_{A,1}$ to a final value $x_{A,2}$ at constant temperature $T$ and pressure $P$.\n\nThe starting point is the total Gibbs free energy, $G$, of a binary ideal solution. It is composed of the Gibbs free energies of the pure components and the Gibbs free energy of mixing, $\\Delta G_{\\text{mix}}$.\n$$G(T, P, n_A, n_B) = n_A G_A^0 + n_B G_B^0 + \\Delta G_{\\text{mix}}$$\nHere, $n_A$ and $n_B$ are the number of moles of components $A$ and $B$, respectively. $G_A^0$ and $G_B^0$ are the molar Gibbs free energies of pure liquid or solid $A$ and $B$ at the specified temperature $T$ and pressure $P$. These are the standard state chemical potentials, $\\mu_A^0$ and $\\mu_B^0$.\n\nFor an ideal solution, the enthalpy of mixing is zero ($\\Delta H_{\\text{mix}} = 0$), so the Gibbs free energy of mixing is purely entropic:\n$$\\Delta G_{\\text{mix}} = -T \\Delta S_{\\text{mix}}$$\nThe molar entropy of mixing for a multicomponent ideal solution is given by $\\Delta S_{\\text{mix}} = -R \\sum_i n_i \\ln x_i$, where $R$ is the universal gas constant and $x_i$ is the mole fraction of component $i$. For our binary system, this becomes:\n$$\\Delta S_{\\text{mix}} = -R (n_A \\ln x_A + n_B \\ln x_B)$$\nThus, the Gibbs free energy of mixing is:\n$$\\Delta G_{\\text{mix}} = RT(n_A \\ln x_A + n_B \\ln x_B)$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the total Gibbs free energy gives:\n$$G = n_A G_A^0 + n_B G_B^0 + RT(n_A \\ln x_A + n_B \\ln x_B)$$\nTo compute the chemical potential, we must express $G$ as a function of $n_A$ and $n_B$. The mole fractions are $x_A = \\frac{n_A}{n_A + n_B}$ and $x_B = \\frac{n_B}{n_A + n_B}$. Substituting these into the expression for $G$:\n$$G = n_A G_A^0 + n_B G_B^0 + RT \\left( n_A \\ln\\left(\\frac{n_A}{n_A+n_B}\\right) + n_B \\ln\\left(\\frac{n_B}{n_A+n_B}\\right) \\right)$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can rewrite this as:\n$$G = n_A G_A^0 + n_B G_B^0 + RT \\left( n_A \\ln n_A - n_A \\ln(n_A+n_B) + n_B \\ln n_B - n_B \\ln(n_A+n_B) \\right)$$\n$$G = n_A G_A^0 + n_B G_B^0 + RT \\left( n_A \\ln n_A + n_B \\ln n_B - (n_A+n_B)\\ln(n_A+n_B) \\right)$$\nThe chemical potential of component $A$, $\\mu_A$, is defined as the partial derivative of the total Gibbs free energy with respect to the number of moles of $A$, while holding temperature $T$, pressure $P$, and the number of moles of all other components (here, $n_B$) constant:\n$$\\mu_A = \\left(\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial n_A}\\right)_{T,P,n_B}$$\nWe now differentiate the expression for $G$ with respect to $n_A$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial n_A} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n_A}(n_A G_A^0) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n_A}(n_B G_B^0) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n_A} \\left[ RT \\left( n_A \\ln n_A + n_B \\ln n_B - (n_A+n_B)\\ln(n_A+n_B) \\right) \\right]$$\nLet's evaluate each term:\n1.  $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n_A}(n_A G_A^0) = G_A^0$\n2.  $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n_A}(n_B G_B^0) = 0$ (since $n_B$ is held constant)\n3.

For a system composed of a set of species $\\{N_i\\}$, its value is a function of a set of variables, including temperature $T$, pressure $P$, and the number of particles $N_i$ for each species. The property of extensivity implies that $G$ is a first-order homogeneous function of the variables $N_i$:\n$$\nG(T, P, \\lambda N_A, \\lambda N_B) = \\lambda G(T, P, N_A, N_B)\n$$\nfor any scaling factor $\\lambda$. Applying Euler's theorem for homogeneous functions to $G$ with respect to the extensive variables $N_i$ yields:\n$$\nG = \\sum_{i=A,B} N_i \\left( \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial N_i} \\right)_{T, P, N_{j \\neq i}}\n$$\nThe chemical potential $\\mu_i$ of species $i$ is defined as this partial molar Gibbs free energy:\n$$\n\\mu_i \\equiv \\left( \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial N_i} \\right)_{T, P, N_{j \\neq i}}\n$$\nSubstituting this definition into the expression for $G$ gives:\n$$\nG = \\mu_A N_A + \\mu_B N_B\n$$\nThe total differential of this expression is found using the product rule:\n$$\ndG = (\\mu_A dN_A + N_A d\\mu_A) + (\\mu_B dN_B + N_B d\\mu_B) = \\sum_{i=A,B} \\mu_i dN_i + \\sum_{i=A,B} N_i d\\mu_i\n$$\nThe fundamental thermodynamic relation for $dG$ is:\n$$\ndG = -SdT + VdP + \\sum_{i=A,B} \\mu_i dN_i\n$$\nBy equating these two expressions for $dG$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=A,B} \\mu_i dN_i + \\sum_{i=A,B} N_i d\\mu_i = -SdT + VdP + \\sum_{i=A,B} \\mu_i dN_i\n$$\nThe term $\\sum_{i} \\mu_i dN_i$ appears on both sides and can be cancelled, which leaves the Gibbs-Duhem relation in its general form:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=A,B} N_i d\\mu_i = -SdT + VdP\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the system is isothermal and isobaric, meaning temperature $T$ and pressure $P$ are held constant. Consequently, their differentials are zero ($dT=0$ and $dP=0$). The relation thus simplifies to:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=A,B} N_i d\\mu_i = 0\n$$\nTo express this in terms of mole fractions, we divide by the total number of particles, $N = N_A + N_B$. The mole fraction of species $i$ is $x_i = N_i/N$.\n$$\n\\sum_{i=A,B} \\frac{N_i}{N} d\\mu_i = \\sum_{i=A,B} x_i d\\mu_i = 0\n$$\nFor the binary system in question, this is $x_A d\\mu_A + x_B d\\mu_B = 0$, which is the form required.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Verification of the Relation**\n\nWe are tasked with computing the discrete residual $R$:\n$$\nR \\equiv \\sum_{k=1}^{8} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{x_{A}^{(k)} + x_{A}^{(k+1)}}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\mu_{A}^{(k+1)} - \\mu_{A}^{(k)}}{k_{B}T}\\right) + \\left(1 - \\frac{x_{A}^{(k)} + x_{A}^{(k+1)}}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\mu_{B}^{(k+1)} - \\mu_{B}^{(k)}}{k_{B}T}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nThe given data for the ideal solution corresponds to the functional form $\\mu_i / (k_B T) = \\ln(x_i)$.

The total sum is $R = \\sum_{k=1}^{8} R_k$. The compositions $x_A^{(k)}$ are uniformly spaced: $x_A^{(k)} = 0.1 \\times k$ for $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 9\\}$. This leads to a crucial symmetry in the composition data.\nLet's analyze the relationship between $x_A$ and $x_B$ across the data points. We have $x_B^{(k)} = 1 - x_A^{(k)} = 1 - 0.1k = 0.1(10 - k)$. This reveals the symmetry $x_B^{(k)} = x_A^{(10-k)}$.\n\nWe will examine the sum by pairing terms symmetrically around the center of the composition range: $(R_1, R_8)$, $(R_2, R_7)$, $(R_3, R_6)$, and $(R_4, R_5)$.\nLet's consider a generic pair of terms, $R_k$ and $R_{9-k}$, for $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\nThe term $R_k$ is:\n$$\nR_k = \\left(\\frac{x_{A}^{(k)} + x_{A}^{(k+1)}}{2}\\right) \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_{A}^{(k+1)}}{x_{A}^{(k)}}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{x_{B}^{(k)} + x_{B}^{(k+1)}}{2}\\right) \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_{B}^{(k+1)}}{x_{B}^{(k)}}\\right)\n$$\nThe term $R_{9-k}$ corresponds to the interval from $x_A^{(9-k)}$ to $x_A^{(10-k)}$. Its expression is:\n$$\nR_{9-k} = \\left(\\frac{x_{A}^{(9-k)} + x_{A}^{(10-k)}}{2}\\right) \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_{A}^{(10-k)}}{x_{A}^{(9-k)}}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{x_{B}^{(9-k)} + x_{B}^{(10-k)}}{2}\\right) \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_{B}^{(10-k)}}{x_{B}^{(9-k)}}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the symmetry $x_B^{(j)} = x_A^{(10-j)}$, we can rewrite the components of $R_{9-k}$:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $x_{A}^{(9-k)} = x_{B}^{(10-(9-k))} = x_{B}^{(k+1)}$\n    \\item $x_{A}^{(10-k)} = x_{B}^{(10-(10-k))} = x_{B}^{(k)}$\n    \\item $x_{B}^{(9-k)} = x_{A}^{(10-(9-k))} = x_{A}^{(k+1)}$\n    \\item $x_{B}^{(10-k)} = x_{A}^{(10-(10-k))} = x_{A}^{(k)}$\n\\end{itemize}\nSubstituting these into the expression for $R_{9-k}$:\n$$\nR_{9-k} = \\left(\\frac{x_{B}^{(k+1)} + x_{B}^{(k)}}{2}\\right) \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_{B}^{(k)}}{x_{B}^{(k+1)}}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{x_{A}^{(k+1)} + x_{A}^{(k)}}{2}\\right) \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_{A}^{(k)}}{x_{A}^{(k+1)}}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the property $\\ln(a/b) = -\\ln(b/a)$:\n$$\nR_{9-k} = -\\left(\\frac{x_{B}^{(k)} + x_{B}^{(k+1)}}{2}\\right) \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_{B}^{(k+1)}}{x_{B}^{(k)}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{x_{A}^{(k)} + x_{A}^{(k+1)}}{2}\\right) \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_{A}^{(k+1)}}{x_{A}^{(k)}}\\right)\n$$\nComparing this with the expression for $R_k$, we see that:\n$$\nR_{9-k} = -R_k\n$$\nTherefore, each symmetric pair of terms in the summation cancels out: $R_k + R_{9-k} = 0$.\nThe total sum $R$ is composed of four such pairs:\n$$\nR = \\sum_{k=1}^8 R_k = (R_1 + R_8) + (R_2 + R_7) + (R_3 + R_6) + (R_4 + R_5)\n$$\nSince $R_1+R_8=0$, $R_2+R_7=0$, $R_3+R_6=0$, and $R_4+R_5=0$, the total sum is:\n$$\nR = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0\n$$\nThe residual $R$ is exactly zero. This result is a direct consequence of the symmetric distribution of data points and the specific functional form for the chemical potentials of an ideal solution, for which the continuous Gibbs-Duhem relation holds perfectly.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and computation of reduced chemical potentials, $\\tilde{\\mu}_A = \\mu_A - \\mu_C$ and $\\tilde{\\mu}_B = \\mu_B - \\mu_C$, for a ternary system ($A, B, C$) described by a Cahn-Hilliard-type free energy functional. The derivation must start from the provided functional and the definition of the variational derivative.\n\nThe total Helmholtz free energy $F$ of the one-dimensional system is given by the functional:\n$$\nF[\\mathbf{c}] \\;=\\; \\int_0^L f(\\mathbf{c}, \\nabla\\mathbf{c}, T) \\, \\mathrm{d}x \\;=\\; \\int_0^L \\left( f_0(\\mathbf{c},T) \\;+\\; \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{3}\\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\kappa_{ij} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} c_i}{\\mathrm{d}x} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} c_j}{\\mathrm{d}x} \\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{c} = (c_A, c_B, c_C)$ represents the molar fractions subject to the constraint $\\sum_i c_i = 1$, $f_0(\\mathbf{c}, T)$ is the bulk free energy density, and the second term is the gradient energy density, $f_{\\text{grad}}$. The indices $i, j$ run over the components $\\{A, B, C\\}$.\n\nThe chemical potential of species $k$, denoted $\\mu_k$, is defined as the variational derivative of the total free energy $F$ with respect to the concentration profile $c_k(x)$:\n$$\n\\mu_k \\;=\\; \\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta c_k}\n$$\nUsing the Euler-Lagrange equation, the variational derivative of a functional of the form $\\int L(c_k, c_k', x) \\mathrm{d}x$ is given by $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial c_k} - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial c_k'}\\right)$. In our context, the Lagrangian is the free energy density $f = f_0 + f_{\\text{grad}}$, and the derivatives are with respect to $c_k$ and $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}c_k}{\\mathrm{d}x}$.\nThus, the chemical potential is:\n$$\n\\mu_k \\;=\\; \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial c_k} - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial (\\mathrm{d}c_k/\\mathrm{d}x)}\\right)\n$$\nWe evaluate the two terms on the right-hand side. The partial derivatives are taken treating the concentrations $c_A$, $c_B$, and $c_C$ as formally independent variables, as is standard practice when setting up the Euler-Lagrange equations. The constraint is handled subsequently.\n\nFirst, we compute the derivative with respect to $c_k$. Since the gradient energy term $f_{\\text{grad}}$ does not explicitly depend on $c_k$ (only on its derivative), this partial derivative acts only on the bulk free energy density $f_0$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial c_k} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial c_k} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial c_k} \\left( \\sum_{i} c_i G_i^0 \\;+\\; RT\\sum_{i} c_i \\ln c_i \\;+\\; \\sum_{ij} c_i c_j L_{ij} \\right)\n$$\nEvaluating this for component $k$ yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial c_k} \\;=\\; G_k^0 + RT( \\ln c_k + 1) + \\sum_{j \\neq k} c_j L_{kj} \\quad (\\text{where } L_{kj} = L_{jk})\n$$\n\nSecond, we compute the derivative with respect to the concentration gradient $\\mathrm{d}c_k/\\mathrm{d}x$. This derivative acts only on the gradient energy term $f_{\\text{grad}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial (\\mathrm{d}c_k/\\mathrm{d}x)} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial (\\mathrm{d}c_k/\\mathrm{d}x)} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i}\\sum_{j} \\kappa_{ij} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} c_i}{\\mathrm{d}x} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} c_j}{\\mathrm{d}x} \\right)\n$$\nUsing the product rule and properties of the Kronecker delta $\\delta_{ik}$, and exploiting the symmetry of the coefficient matrix ($\\kappa_{ij} = \\kappa_{ji}$), this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial (\\mathrm{d}c_k/\\mathrm{d}x)} \\;=\\; \\sum_{j} \\kappa_{kj} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} c_j}{\\mathrm{d}x}\n$$\nTaking the total derivative with respect to the spatial coordinate $x$ and assuming the coefficients $\\kappa_{kj}$ are constant, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial (\\mathrm{d}c_k/\\mathrm{d}x)}\\right) \\;=\\; \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left( \\sum_{j} \\kappa_{kj} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} c_j}{\\mathrm{d}x} \\right) \\;=\\; \\sum_{j} \\kappa_{kj} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 c_j}{\\mathrm{d}x^2}\n$$\nCombining these results gives the full expression for the chemical potential of component $k$:\n$$\n\\mu_k \\;=\\; G_k^0 + RT(1 + \\ln c_k) + \\sum_{j \\neq k} c_j L_{kj} - \\sum_{j} \\kappa_{kj} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 c_j}{\\mathrm{d}x^2}\n$$\nThe constraint $\\sum_i c_i = 1$ implies that the variations $\\delta c_i$ are not independent, as $\\sum_i \\delta c_i = 0$. The condition for thermodynamic equilibrium, $\\delta F = \\int \\sum_i \\mu_i \\delta c_i \\mathrm{d}x = 0$, then requires that the diffusion driving forces, which are the differences between chemical potentials, must vanish. For example, $\\mu_A - \\mu_C = 0$ and $\\mu_B - \\mu_C = 0$. The problem asks for these reduced chemical potentials, $\\tilde{\\mu}_A = \\mu_A - \\mu_C$ and $\\tilde{\\mu}_B = \\mu_B - \\mu_C$, which are the relevant quantities in diffusion models where one component is treated as dependent.\n\nWe now derive the explicit expression for $\\tilde{\\mu}_A = \\mu_A - \\mu_C$:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mu}_A \\;=\\; (\\mu_{A,\\text{bulk}} - \\mu_{C,\\text{bulk}}) - (\\mu_{A,\\text{grad}} - \\mu_{C,\\text{grad}})\n$$\nwhere we have split the potential into a bulk part and a gradient part.\n$\\mu_{A} = G_A^0 + RT(1+\\ln c_A) + c_B L_{AB} + c_C L_{AC} - \\sum_j \\kappa_{Aj}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2c_j}{\\mathrm{d}x^2}$\n$\\mu_{C} = G_C^0 + RT(1+\\ln c_C) + c_A L_{AC} + c_B L_{BC} - \\sum_j \\kappa_{Cj}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2c_j}{\\mathrm{d}x^2}$\n\nSubtracting the two expressions:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mu}_A = (G_A^0 - G_C^0) + RT(\\ln c_A - \\ln c_C) + (c_B L_{AB} + c_C L_{AC}) - (c_A L_{AC} + c_B L_{BC}) - \\sum_{j} (\\kappa_{Aj} - \\kappa_{Cj}) \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 c_j}{\\mathrm{d}x^2}\n$$\nRearranging the interaction terms gives the bulk part:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mu}_{A,\\text{bulk}} = (G_A^0 - G_C^0) + RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{c_A}{c_C}\\right) + c_B(L_{AB} - L_{BC}) + (c_C - c_A)L_{AC}\n$$\nUsing the constraint $c_C = 1 - c_A - c_B$, we can write $c_C - c_A = 1 - 2c_A - c_B$.\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mu}_{A,\\text{bulk}} = G_A^0 - G_C^0 + RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{c_A}{c_C}\\right) + c_B(L_{AB} - L_{BC}) + (1-2c_A-c_B)L_{AC}\n$$\nThe gradient part is:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mu}_{A,\\text{grad}} = - \\left[ (\\kappa_{AA}-\\kappa_{CA})\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2c_A}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} + (\\kappa_{AB}-\\kappa_{CB})\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2c_B}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} + (\\kappa_{AC}-\\kappa_{CC})\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2c_C}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} \\right]\n$$\nThus, the final expression for $\\tilde{\\mu}_A$ is $\\tilde{\\mu}_A = \\tilde{\\mu}_{A,\\text{bulk}} + \\tilde{\\mu}_{A,\\text{grad}}$.\n\nBy symmetry, swapping component $A$ with $B$, we obtain the expression for $\\tilde{\\mu}_B = \\mu_B - \\mu_C$:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mu}_{B,\\text{bulk}} = G_B^0 - G_C^0 + RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{c_B}{c_C}\\right) + c_A(L_{AB} - L_{AC}) + (1-c_A-2c_B)L_{BC}\n$$\nAnd the gradient part:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mu}_{B,\\text{grad}} = - \\left[ (\\kappa_{BA}-\\kappa_{CA})\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2c_A}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} + (\\kappa_{BB}-\\kappa_{CB})\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2c_B}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} + (\\kappa_{BC}-\\kappa_{CC})\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2c_C}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} \\right]\n$$\nThese derived formulas are implemented in the following program to evaluate the reduced chemical potentials for the given test cases. We use the symmetry of the gradient energy coefficient matrix, $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}$, where $\\kappa_{ij}=\\kappa_{ji}$.",
