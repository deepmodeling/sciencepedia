In a multiscale coupling using the Bridging Domain Method (BDM), an atomistic description (A) and a continuum description (C) overlap over a subinterval (the bridging domain) of length $\\ell$, with $\\ell \\leq L$. In the bridging domain, the coupled energy is formed by blending the atomistic and continuum energies using spatially varying weights $w_{A}(x)$ and $w_{C}(x)$. In a consistent BDM formulation, the weights should satisfy $w_{A}(x)+w_{C}(x)=1$ for all $x$ in the overlap in order to avoid bias.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the total energy error introduced in a Bridging Domain Method (BDM) formulation due to an improper normalization of the blending weights. The physical system is a uniform linear elastic bar under constant axial tension. To solve this, we first establish the benchmark, which is the true strain energy of the bar. Then, we formulate the energy within the BDM-blended model and find the difference.\n\nFirst, let us define the state of the bar under the given load. The bar has a Young's modulus $E$, a cross-sectional area $A$, and is subjected to a constant axial force $F$. According to linear elasticity, the axial stress $\\sigma$ is uniform and given by:\n$$ \\sigma = \\frac{F}{A} $$\nThe axial strain $\\epsilon$ is also uniform and is related to the stress by Hooke's law:\n$$ \\epsilon = \\frac{\\sigma}{E} = \\frac{F}{EA} $$\nThe strain energy density $u$, which is the strain energy per unit volume, for a linear elastic material is:\n$$ u = \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma \\epsilon $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\sigma$ and $\\epsilon$, we obtain the strain energy density in terms of the given parameters:\n$$ u = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{F}{A}\\right) \\left(\\frac{F}{EA}\\right) = \\frac{F^2}{2EA^2} $$\nSince the bar is uniform and the loading is constant, this energy density $u$ is constant throughout the entire volume of the bar. The total true strain energy $U_{true}$ is the integral of this density over the total volume $V = A L$.\n$$ U_{true} = \\int_V u \\, dV = u \\cdot V = \\left(\\frac{F^2}{2EA^2}\\right) (A L) = \\frac{F^2 L}{2EA} $$\nThis expression represents the correct, single-model strain energy of the system.\n\nNext, we formulate the total energy within the BDM framework with the specified improper normalization. The bar is divided into regions. A portion of the bar, of length $\\ell$, is the bridging domain where atomistic (A) and continuum (C) models are blended. The remainder of the bar, of length $L-\\ell$, is modeled using a single description (e.g., continuum).\n\nThe problem states that the atomistic and continuum descriptions produce identical energy densities for this problem. This means $u_A(x) = u_C(x) = u$, where $u$ is the constant energy density derived previously.\n\nOutside the bridging domain (a region of total length $L-\\ell$), the energy density is simply $u$. The energy stored in this part of the bar, $U_{out}$, is:\n$$ U_{out} = u \\cdot A (L-\\ell) $$\nInside the bridging domain (length $\\ell$), the energy density is blended using the weights $w_A(x)$ and $w_C(x)$. The blended energy density, $u_{BDM}(x)$, is:\n$$ u_{BDM}(x) = w_A(x) u_A(x) + w_C(x) u_C(x) = (w_A(x) + w_C(x)) u $$\nWe are given that the weights are improperly normalized, such that $w_A(x) + w_C(x) = 1 + \\delta(x)$. Thus, the energy density in the bridging domain is:\n$$ u_{BDM}(x) = (1 + \\delta(x)) u $$\nThe total energy stored in the bridging domain, $U_{bridge}$, is the integral of this blended energy density over the volume of the bridging domain.

The integral becomes:\n$$ \\int_{overlap} \\delta(x) \\, dx = \\int_{x_0}^{x_0+\\ell} \\delta \\, dx = \\delta \\int_{x_0}^{x_0+\\ell} dx = \\delta \\ell $$\nSubstituting this into the general error expression gives the specialized expression for the error:\n$$ \\Delta U = \\frac{F^2 \\delta \\ell}{2EA} $$\n\nFinally, we evaluate this expression using the provided numerical data:\n$E = 200 \\times 10^{9}$ Pa\n$A = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}$ m$^2$\n$\\ell = 0.10$ m\n$F = 1.0 \\times 10^{4}$ N\n$\\delta = 0.050$\n\nWe substitute these values into the specialized error formula:\n$$ \\Delta U = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{4} \\, \\text{N})^2 (0.050) (0.10 \\, \\text{m})}{2 (200 \\times 10^{9} \\, \\text{Pa}) (1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{m}^2)} $$\n$$ \\Delta U = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{8} \\, \\text{N}^2) (0.0050 \\, \\text{m})}{2 (2.0 \\times 10^{11} \\, \\text{N/m}^2) (1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{m}^2)} $$\n$$ \\Delta U = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{5} \\, \\text{N}^2 \\cdot \\text{m}}{4.0 \\times 10^{7} \\, \\text{N}} = 1.25 \\times 10^{-2} \\, \\text{N} \\cdot \\text{m} $$\nSince $1$ Joule ($J$) is equal to $1$ Newton-meter ($N \\cdot m$), the energy error is:\n$$ \\Delta U = 0.0125 \\, \\text{J} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the final answer is $0.01250$ J.",

The hybrid strain field contains terms proportional to $w'(x)$, such as $w'(x)(u_a-u_c)$. A large gradient $w'(x)$ implies a rapid change in the \"effective material properties\" across the overlap region. In dynamics, a rapid change in properties constitutes an impedance mismatch. When a wave (e.g., a phonon packet) propagates from the atomistic to the continuum region, it encounters this impedance mismatch, which causes non-physical (spurious) wave reflection. To minimize these artifacts and ensure smooth transmission of waves, it is desirable to have the maximum gradient, $\\max |w'(x)|$, be as small as possible.\n\n2.  **Global Smoothness**: In elastodynamics, the force on a material particle is related to the second spatial derivative of the displacement field, $u''(x)$. For the hybrid field, the force calculation will involve second derivatives of $w(x)$.\n    - If $w(x)$ is only $C^0$ (like the linear profile), its first derivative $w'(x)$ is discontinuous. This leads to a jump in the strain field. Its second derivative $w''(x)$ contains Dirac delta functions at the interfaces. This manifests as spurious \"ghost forces\" concentrated at the boundaries of the overlap region, which severely contaminates the dynamics.\n    - If $w(x)$ is $C^1$ (like the cosine and cubic-spline profiles), its first derivative $w'(x)$ is continuous, ensuring a continuous strain field. However, its second derivative $w''(x)$ is discontinuous. This results in a jump (a step discontinuity) in the force field at the interfaces. While much better than infinite ghost forces, this can still excite spurious high-frequency oscillations and potentially lead to numerical instability in explicit time integration schemes unless the time step is severely restricted.\n    - Higher smoothness ($C^2$ or greater) is ideal as it ensures a continuous force field, leading to better stability and reduced high-frequency noise.\n\nIn summary, a low maximum gradient and high smoothness class (at least $C^1$) are crucial for a high-quality blending function.\n\n**Computation of the Figure-of-Merit $J$**\n\nThe figure-of-merit $J$ is defined as the product of the maximum normalized gradients for the three profiles.\n$$\nJ \\equiv \\prod_{\\hat{w} \\in \\{\\hat{w}_{\\mathrm{L}},\\,\\hat{w}_{\\mathrm{C}},\\,\\hat{w}_{\\mathrm{S}}\\}} \\left( \\max_{s \\in [0,1]} \\left| \\frac{d\\hat{w}}{ds}(s) \\right| \\right).\n$$\nUsing the results from Task 1:\n- $\\max |\\frac{d\\hat{w}_{\\mathrm{L}}}{ds}| = 1$\n- $\\max |\\frac{d\\hat{w}_{\\mathrm{C}}}{ds}| = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$\n- $\\max |\\frac{d\\hat{w}_{\\mathrm{S}}}{ds}| = \\frac{3}{2}$\n\nThe product is:\n$$\nJ = (1) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) = \\frac{3\\pi}{4}.\n$$",

The blended energy functional becomes:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}[u] = \\int_{0}^{L} \\left( w_{\\mathrm{A}}(x)\\,\\Psi(\\alpha) + w_{\\mathrm{C}}(x)\\,\\Psi(\\alpha) \\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nUsing the partition-of-unity property $w_{\\mathrm{A}}(x) + w_{\\mathrm{C}}(x) = 1$, we get:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}[u] = \\int_{0}^{L} \\left( w_{\\mathrm{A}}(x) + w_{\\mathrm{C}}(x) \\right)\\,\\Psi(\\alpha)\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{0}^{L} \\Psi(\\alpha)\\,\\mathrm{d}x = L\\,\\Psi(\\alpha)\n$$\nThis is the correct energy for a uniform bar of length $L$ under a constant strain $\\alpha$. This result holds for any functions $w_{\\mathrm{A}}(x)$ and $w_{\\mathrm{C}}(x)$ that form a partition of unity. Therefore, this criterion is fundamental to the BDM formulation and does not impose any additional constraints on the specific functional form of $w(x)$ beyond what is already stated. The core task is to solve the variational problem defined by the second criterion.\n\nThe second criterion requires us to find a function $w(x)$ that minimizes the functional:\n$$\nJ[w] = \\int_{0}^{L} \\left( w^{(3)}(x) \\right)^{2} \\,\\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nsubject to the six boundary conditions:\n$$\nw(0) = 1, \\quad w(L) = 0 \\\\\nw'(0) = 0, \\quad w'(L) = 0 \\\\\nw''(0) = 0, \\quad w''(L) = 0\n$$\nThis is a standard problem in the calculus of variations. The Lagrangian is $F(x, w, w', w'', w^{(3)}) = (w^{(3)})^2$. The Euler-Lagrange equation for a functional depending on derivatives up to order $n$ is given by $\\sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^k \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^k}{\\mathrm{d}x^k} \\left( \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial w^{(k)}} \\right) = 0$. In our case, $n=3$ and $F$ only depends on $w^{(3)}$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\n(-1)^3 \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^3}{\\mathrm{d}x^3} \\left( \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial w^{(3)}} \\right) = 0\n$$\nCalculating the partial derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial w^{(3)}} = 2w^{(3)}(x)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the Euler-Lagrange equation yields:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^3}{\\mathrm{d}x^3} \\left( 2w^{(3)}(x) \\right) = -2w^{(6)}(x) = 0 \\implies w^{(6)}(x) = 0\n$$\nThe general solution to this sixth-order ordinary differential equation is a polynomial of degree five:\n$$\nw(x) = c_5 x^5 + c_4 x^4 + c_3 x^3 + c_2 x^2 + c_1 x + c_0\n$$\nThe six coefficients $c_0, c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, c_5$ are determined by the six boundary conditions. First, we compute the first and second derivatives of $w(x)$:\n$$\nw'(x) = 5c_5 x^4 + 4c_4 x^3 + 3c_3 x^2 + 2c_2 x + c_1\n$$\n$$\nw''(x) = 20c_5 x^3 + 12c_4 x^2 + 6c_3 x + 2c_2\n$$\nApplying the boundary conditions at $x=0$:\n- $w(0) = 1 \\implies c_0 = 1$\n- $w'(0) = 0 \\implies c_1 = 0$\n- $w''(0) = 0 \\implies 2c_2 = 0 \\implies c_2 = 0$\n\nThus, the polynomial is of the form $w(x) = c_5 x^5 + c_4 x^4 + c_3 x^3 + 1$.\nNow, applying the boundary conditions at $x=L$:\n- $w(L) = 0 \\implies c_5 L^5 + c_4 L^4 + c_3 L^3 + 1 = 0$\n- $w'(L) = 0 \\implies 5c_5 L^4 + 4c_4 L^3 + 3c_3 L^2 = 0$\n- $w''(L) = 0 \\implies 20c_5 L^3 + 12c_4 L^2 + 6c_3 L = 0$\n\nAssuming $L \\neq 0$, we can simplify this system of three linear equations for the coefficients $c_3, c_4, c_5$:\n1. $c_5 L^5 + c_4 L^4 + c_3 L^3 = -1$\n2. $5c_5 L^2 + 4c_4 L + 3c_3 = 0$\n3. $10c_5 L^2 + 6c_4 L + 3c_3 = 0$\n\nSubtracting equation (2) from equation (3):\n$$\n(10-5)c_5 L^2 + (6-4)c_4 L + (3-3)c_3 = 0\n$$\n$$\n5c_5 L^2 + 2c_4 L = 0 \\implies 2c_4 = -5c_5 L \\implies c_4 = -\\frac{5}{2}c_5 L\n$$\nSubstitute this expression for $c_4$ into equation (2):\n$$\n5c_5 L^2 + 4\\left(-\\frac{5}{2}c_5 L\\right)L + 3c_3 = 0\n$$\n$$\n5c_5 L^2 - 10c_5 L^2 + 3c_3 = 0 \\implies -5c_5 L^2 + 3c_3 = 0 \\implies c_3 = \\frac{5}{3}c_5 L^2\n$$\nFinally, substitute the expressions for $c_3$ and $c_4$ into equation (1):\n$$\nc_5 L^5 + \\left(-\\frac{5}{2}c_5 L\\right) L^4 + \\left(\\frac{5}{3}c_5 L^2\\right) L^3 = -1\n$$\n$$\nc_5 L^5 \\left(1 - \\frac{5}{2} + \\frac{5}{3}\\right) = -1\n$$\n$$\nc_5 L^5 \\left(\\frac{6 - 15 + 10}{6}\\right) = -1\n$$\n$$\nc_5 L^5 \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) = -1 \\implies c_5 = -\\frac{6}{L^5}\n$$\nNow back-substitute to find $c_4$ and $c_3$:\n$$\nc_4 = -\\frac{5}{2} \\left(-\\frac{6}{L^5}\\right) L = \\frac{15}{L^4}\n$$\n$$\nc_3 = \\frac{5}{3} \\left(-\\frac{6}{L^5}\\right) L^2 = -\\frac{10}{L^3}\n$$\nThe determined coefficients are $c_0=1$, $c_1=0$, $c_2=0$, $c_3=-10/L^3$, $c_4=15/L^4$, and $c_5=-6/L^5$.\nSubstituting these into the polynomial form for $w(x)$ gives the solution for $w_{\\mathrm{A}}(x)$:\n$$\nw_{\\mathrm{A}}(x) = 1 - \\frac{10}{L^3}x^3 + \\frac{15}{L^4}x^4 - \\frac{6}{L^5}x^5\n$$\nThis can be written more compactly using the normalized coordinate $\\xi = x/L$:\n$$\nw_{\\mathrm{A}}(x) = 1 - 10\\left(\\frac{x}{L}\\right)^3 + 15\\left(\\frac{x}{L}\\right)^4 - 6\\left(\\frac{x}{L}\\right)^5\n$$\nAs a final check, we verify the monotonicity. The first derivative is:\n$$\nw'_{\\mathrm{A}}(x) = -\\frac{30}{L^3}x^2 + \\frac{60}{L^4}x^3 - \\frac{30}{L^5}x^4 = -\\frac{30x^2}{L^5}(L^2 - 2Lx + x^2) = -\\frac{30x^2(L-x)^2}{L^5}\n$$\nFor $x \\in (0,L)$ and $L>0$, we have $x^2 > 0$, $(L-x)^2 > 0$, and $L^5 > 0$. Thus, $w'_{\\mathrm{A}}(x) < 0$ for $x \\in (0,L)$. Since $w'_{\\mathrm{A}}(0)=0$ and $w'_{\\mathrm{A}}(L)=0$, the function $w_{\\mathrm{A}}(x)$ is monotonically decreasing on the interval $[0,L]$, satisfying the stated requirement.",
