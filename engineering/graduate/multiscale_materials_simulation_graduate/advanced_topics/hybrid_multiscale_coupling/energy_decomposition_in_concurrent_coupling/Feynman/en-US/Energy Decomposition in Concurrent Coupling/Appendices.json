The continuum subsystem is a linearly elastic rod characterized by an effective axial modulus per unit length $M_c$ (for a continuum with Young's modulus $Y_c$ and cross-sectional area $A$, one may identify $M_c = Y_c A$), so that its strain energy density per unit length is $\\frac{1}{2} M_c \\varepsilon^2$.\n\nThe two models are concurrently coupled over a finite overlap region of length $L_o$, flanked by a purely atomistic region of length $L_a$ and a purely continuum region of length $L_c$, with $L_{\\text{tot}} = L_a + L_o + L_c$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the ghost force magnitude, $F_{\\text{ghost}}$, for five test cases using the provided formula:\n$$\nF_{\\text{ghost}} = \\left| \\left(w_1^{\\text{left}} - w_1^{\\text{right}} \\right) k_1 a \\varepsilon + \\left(w_2^{\\text{left}} - w_2^{\\text{right}} \\right) k_2 \\cdot 2 a \\varepsilon \\right|\n$$\nGiven that the atomistic-side weights are $w_1^{\\text{left}} = 1$ and $w_2^{\\text{left}} = 1$, the formula simplifies to:\n$$\nF_{\\text{ghost}} = \\left|a \\varepsilon \\left[ \\left(1 - w_1^{\\text{right}} \\right) k_1 + 2\\left(1 - w_2^{\\text{right}} \\right) k_2 \\right]\\right|\n$$\nWe calculate the pre-correction and post-correction forces for each test case.\n\n**Part 1: Pre-Correction Ghost Force Calculation**\nThe common parameters for tests 1-4 are $k_1 = 1.0$, $k_2 = 0.4$, $a = 1.0$, and $\\varepsilon = 0.01$. The quadrature rules provide the values for $w_1^{\\text{right}}$ and $w_2^{\\text{right}}$.\n\n- **Test 1 (Midpoint rule):** $w_1^{\\text{right}} = 0.5$, $w_2^{\\text{right}} = 0.5$.\n  $F_{\\text{ghost}} = |1.0 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot [(1 - 0.5) \\cdot 1.0 + 2(1 - 0.5) \\cdot 0.4]| = 0.01 \\cdot |0.5 + 0.4| = 0.009$.\n\n- **Test 2 (Trapezoid rule):** $w_1^{\\text{right}} = 1$, $w_2^{\\text{right}} = 1$.\n  $F_{\\text{ghost}} = |1.0 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot [(1 - 1) \\cdot 1.0 + 2(1 - 1) \\cdot 0.4]| = 0$.\n\n- **Test 3 (Node-lumped rule):** $w_1^{\\text{right}} = 0$, $w_2^{\\text{right}} = 0$.\n  $F_{\\text{ghost}} = |1.0 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot [(1 - 0) \\cdot 1.0 + 2(1 - 0) \\cdot 0.4]| = 0.01 \\cdot |1.0 + 0.8| = 0.018$.\n\n- **Test 4 (Atomistic rule):** $w_1^{\\text{right}} = 1$, $w_2^{\\text{right}} = 1$.\n  $F_{\\text{ghost}} = 0$, identical to the trapezoid rule.\n\n- **Test 5 (Edge case):** $\\varepsilon = 0.0$.\n  $F_{\\text{ghost}} = |1.0 \\cdot 0.0 \\cdot [\\dots]| = 0$.\n\nThe list of pre-correction ghost force magnitudes is: `[0.009, 0.0, 0.018, 0.0, 0.0]`.\n\n**Part 2: Post-Correction Ghost Force Calculation**\nThe patch test correction sets the continuum-side weights to match the atomistic-side weights, i.e., $w_1^{\\text{right}} = 1$ and $w_2^{\\text{right}} = 1$. Applying these to the formula for all test cases yields:\n$$\nF_{\\text{ghost, corr}} = \\left|a \\varepsilon \\left[ (1 - 1) k_1 + 2(1 - 1) k_2 \\right]\\right| = 0\n$$\nTherefore, the post-correction ghost force is zero for all five tests. The list of post-correction magnitudes is: `[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]`.",
