The bar axis is taken as the $x$-direction, and all kinematic and force quantities are colinear with this axis. Three atoms in the overlap have positions $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$ measured from the left node and experience atomistic forces $f_1$, $f_2$, and $f_3$ along the $x$-direction due to interatomic interactions and applied loads.\n\nAssume the following data: the element length is $L=2$ nm, the atomic positions are $x_1=0.2$ nm, $x_2=0.8$ nm, and $x_3=1.5$ nm, and the corresponding atomistic forces are $f_1=0.5$ nN, $f_2=-1.2$ nN, and $f_3=0.9$ nN.\n\nStarting from the principle of virtual work and the standard $C^0$ linear Lagrange interpolation of the virtual displacement field within the element, derive the expression that maps the atomistic forces $\\{f_i\\}$ to the coarse-grained FE nodal force at the left node, and then compute its numerical value for the data above.

The derivation must start from the principle of virtual work.\n\nThe principle of virtual work, when applied to a coupled atomistic-continuum system, establishes an energy and force consistency between the two scales. It states that the virtual work done by the coarse-grained FE nodal forces, $\\delta W_{\\text{FE}}$, must be equal to the virtual work done by the fine-scale atomistic forces, $\\delta W_{\\text{at}}$, for any kinematically admissible virtual displacement field.\n$$ \\delta W_{\\text{FE}} = \\delta W_{\\text{at}} $$\n\nThe virtual work done by the FE nodal forces $F_1$ and $F_2$ at the left ($x=0$) and right ($x=L$) nodes, respectively, is given by:\n$$ \\delta W_{\\text{FE}} = F_1 \\delta U_1 + F_2 \\delta U_2 $$\nwhere $\\delta U_1$ and $\\delta U_2$ are the virtual displacements of the left and right nodes, respectively.\n\nThe virtual work done by the discrete atomistic forces $\\{f_i\\}$ acting on the atoms at positions $\\{x_i\\}$ is:\n$$ \\delta W_{\\text{at}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} f_i \\delta u_i $$\nwhere $\\delta u_i$ is the virtual displacement of the $i$-th atom.\n\nThe connection between the continuum and atomistic scales is made through the FE interpolation of the displacement field. The problem specifies a two-node linear element with standard $C^0$ Lagrange interpolation functions (or shape functions), $N_1(x)$ and $N_2(x)$.

Collecting these contributions, the total energy associated with bond $(i, i+1)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\left[ w_i E^{\\text{MD}}(r_{i+1,i}) + (1-w_i) E^{\\text{FEM}}(r_{i+1,i}) \\right] + \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ w_{i+1} E^{\\text{MD}}(r_{i+1,i}) + (1-w_{i+1}) E^{\\text{FEM}}(r_{i+1,i}) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n= \\left(\\frac{w_i+w_{i+1}}{2}\\right) E^{\\text{MD}}(r_{i+1,i}) + \\left(1 - \\frac{w_i+w_{i+1}}{2}\\right) E^{\\text{FEM}}(r_{i+1,i})\n$$\nLet's define a bond-based blending weight $\\bar{w}_{i+1/2} = \\frac{w_i + w_{i+1}}{2}$. The total energy can be rewritten as a sum over bonds:\n$$\nE^{\\text{tot}} = \\sum_i \\left[ \\bar{w}_{i+1/2} E^{\\text{MD}}(r_{i+1,i}) + (1-\\bar{w}_{i+1/2}) E^{\\text{FEM}}(r_{i+1,i}) \\right]\n$$\nThe force on atom $j$, which we term the ghost force $F_j^{\\text{ghost}}$, is $F_j^{\\text{ghost}} = -\\frac{\\partial E^{\\text{tot}}}{\\partial x_j}$. The position $x_j$ influences only the bonds $(j-1,j)$ and $(j,j+1)$.\n$$\nF_j^{\\text{ghost}} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} \\left[ \\left(\\bar{w}_{j-1/2} E^{\\text{MD}}(r_{j,j-1}) + (1-\\bar{w}_{j-1/2}) E^{\\text{FEM}}(r_{j,j-1})\\right) + \\left(\\bar{w}_{j+1/2} E^{\\text{MD}}(r_{j+1,j}) + (1-\\bar{w}_{j+1/2}) E^{\\text{FEM}}(r_{j+1,j})\\right) \\right]\n$$\nApplying the chain rule, we obtain:\n$$\nF_j^{\\text{ghost}} = \\left[ \\bar{w}_{j+1/2} \\frac{dE^{\\text{MD}}(r_{j+1,j})}{dr} + (1-\\bar{w}_{j+1/2}) \\frac{dE^{\\text{FEM}}(r_{j+1,j})}{dr} \\right] - \\left[ \\bar{w}_{j-1/2} \\frac{dE^{\\text{MD}}(r_{j,j-1})}{dr} + (1-\\bar{w}_{j-1/2}) \\frac{dE^{\\text{FEM}}(r_{j,j-1})}{dr} \\right]\n$$\nUnder homogeneous deformation, $r_{j,j-1} = r_{j+1,j} = r = a(1+\\epsilon)$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\nF_j^{\\text{ghost}} = \\left( \\bar{w}_{j+1/2}-\\bar{w}_{j-1/2} \\right) \\frac{dE^{\\text{MD}}(r)}{dr} + \\left( (1-\\bar{w}_{j+1/2}) - (1-\\bar{w}_{j-1/2}) \\right) \\frac{dE^{\\text{FEM}}(r)}{dr}\n$$\n$$\nF_j^{\\text{ghost}} = \\left( \\bar{w}_{j+1/2}-\\bar{w}_{j-1/2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{dE^{\\text{MD}}(r)}{dr} - \\frac{dE^{\\text{FEM}}(r)}{dr} \\right)\n$$\nNow we evaluate the two terms in this product. First, the difference in bond weights:\n$$\n\\bar{w}_{j+1/2}-\\bar{w}_{j-1/2} = \\frac{w_j + w_{j+1}}{2} - \\frac{w_{j-1} + w_j}{2} = \\frac{w_{j+1} - w_{j-1}}{2}\n$$\nGiven the linear variation of weights, $w_{i+1} - w_i = s$. This implies $w_{j+1} = w_j + s$ and $w_{j-1} = w_j - s$. Therefore, $w_{j+1} - w_{j-1} = (w_j+s) - (w_j-s) = 2s$.\n$$\n\\bar{w}_{j+1/2}-\\bar{w}_{j-1/2} = \\frac{2s}{2} = s\n$$\nNext, the difference in the energy derivatives (which represent the Cauchy stress in the bond):\n$$\n\\frac{dE^{\\text{MD}}(r)}{dr} = \\frac{d}{dr} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} k (r-a)^2 + \\frac{1}{3} \\alpha (r-a)^3 \\right] = k(r-a) + \\alpha(r-a)^2\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dE^{\\text{FEM}}(r)}{dr} = \\frac{d}{dr} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} k (r-a)^2 \\right] = k(r-a)\n$$\nThe difference is:\n$$\n\\frac{dE^{\\text{MD}}(r)}{dr} - \\frac{dE^{\\text{FEM}}(r)}{dr} = \\alpha(r-a)^2\n$$\nSubstituting $r = a(1+\\epsilon)$, we get $r-a = a\\epsilon$. The difference becomes $\\alpha(a\\epsilon)^2 = \\alpha a^2 \\epsilon^2$.\nFinally, combining all parts, the ghost force on atom $j$ is:\n$$\nF_j^{\\text{ghost}} = (s) \\times (\\alpha a^2 \\epsilon^2) = s \\alpha a^2 \\epsilon^2\n$$\nThis expression is independent of the atom index $j$, meaning the ghost force is constant for all atoms within the blending region where the weight function has a constant slope $s$. The force depends on the gradient of the blending function $s$, the non-linearity mismatch $\\alpha$, the lattice parameter $a$, and the strain $\\epsilon$. It is independent of the harmonic stiffness $k$.",
