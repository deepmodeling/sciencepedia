Using fundamental thermodynamics consistent with Transition State Theory (TST), define the energy barrier for a pathway as the standard Gibbs free energy of the highest transition state along that pathway, measured relative to the standard Gibbs free energy of the reactant state at the specified absolute temperature. For the concerted pathway, the barrier is the standard Gibbs free energy of activation relative to the reactant. For the stepwise pathway, the barrier is the largest standard Gibbs free energy of any transition state encountered along the path, each measured relative to the reactant; in particular, if the second transition state is provided relative to the intermediate, its value relative to the reactant is the sum of the intermediate’s standard Gibbs free energy (relative to the reactant) and the second standard Gibbs free energy of activation (relative to the intermediate).

According to Transition State Theory, the rate of a reaction is exponentially dependent on this barrier. A lower barrier corresponds to a faster reaction rate. Consequently, when comparing two competing reaction pathways, the one with the lower overall energy barrier is kinetically favored.\n\nThe problem requires a comparison between a concerted and a stepwise pathway for a unimolecular isomerization. The energy barrier for each pathway is defined as the standard Gibbs free energy of the highest-energy transition state along that pathway, relative to the initial reactant state. All calculations must be performed with consistent units. Given that enthalpies ($\\Delta H$) are in $\\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$ and entropies ($\\Delta S$) are in $\\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}$, the term $T \\Delta S^{\\ddagger}$ must be divided by $1000$ to convert it from $\\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}}$ to $\\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$.

This pathway involves a single transition state. The barrier, which we denote as $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{conc, barrier}}$, is therefore the standard Gibbs free energy of activation for this single step.\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{conc, barrier}} = \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{conc}} = \\Delta H^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{conc}} - T \\frac{\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{conc}}}{1000}\n$$\nHere, $\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{conc}}$ and $\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{conc}}$ are the standard activation enthalpy and entropy for the concerted reaction, respectively.\n\nSecond, we determine the energy barrier for the stepwise pathway. This pathway involves two transition states, $TS_1$ and $TS_2$, and one intermediate, $I$. The overall barrier for this pathway, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{step, barrier}}$, is the maximum of the standard Gibbs free energies of $TS_1$ and $TS_2$, both measured relative to the reactant state, $R$.\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{step, barrier}} = \\max(\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{TS_1, \\text{rel R}}, \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{TS_2, \\text{rel R}})\n$$\nLet us compute each of these terms.\nThe Gibbs free energy of the first transition state relative to the reactant, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{TS_1, \\text{rel R}}$, is the activation barrier for the first step:\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{TS_1, \\text{rel R}} = \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_1 = \\Delta H^{\\ddagger}_1 - T \\frac{\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}_1}{1000}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}_1$ and $\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}_1$ are the thermodynamic parameters for the first activation step.\n\nThe Gibbs free energy of the second transition state relative to the reactant, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{TS_2, \\text{rel R}}$, must be calculated by first establishing the energy of the intermediate, $I$, relative to the reactant, $R$. The standard Gibbs free energy of the intermediate relative to the reactant is:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{int}} = \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{int}} - T \\frac{\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{int}}}{1000}\n$$\nThe second activation barrier, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_2$, is given for the step from the intermediate $I$ to the second transition state $TS_2$:\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_2 = \\Delta H^{\\ddagger}_2 - T \\frac{\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}_2}{1000}\n$$\nTherefore, the total Gibbs free energy of $TS_2$ relative to the initial reactant $R$ is the sum of the energy of the intermediate (relative to $R$) and the activation energy of the second step (relative to $I$):\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{TS_2, \\text{rel R}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{int}} + \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_2 = (\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{int}} + \\Delta H^{\\ddagger}_2) - T \\frac{(\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{int}} + \\Delta S^{\\ddagger}_2)}{1000}\n$$\nThe stepwise pathway barrier is then the greater of these two values, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{TS_1, \\text{rel R}}$ and $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{TS_2, \\text{rel R}}$.\n\nFinally, after computing both $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{conc, barrier}}$ and $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{step, barrier}}$, we round each value to two decimal places. We then compare these rounded values to determine the favored pathway.\n- If $\\text{round}(\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{conc, barrier}})$ is less than $\\text{round}(\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{step, barrier}})$, the concerted pathway is favored (code $0$).\n- If $\\text{round}(\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{step, barrier}})$ is less than $\\text{round}(\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{conc, barrier}})$, the stepwise pathway is favored (code $1$).\n- If the rounded values are equal, it is a tie (code $2$).\n\nThese steps are implemented algorithmically for each test case provided.",
