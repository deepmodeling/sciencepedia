This exercise  uses the classic double-well potential, $V(x)=\\frac{1}{4}(x^2-1)^2$, a fundamental model for transitions between two stable states. By directly applying calculus to find and classify the stationary points, you will develop a concrete understanding of how a saddle point serves as an energy maximum along the transition path and is characterized by its negative curvature, the very feature the dimer method is designed to find.",

            "problem": "Consider a symmetric double-well potential energy surface in one spatial dimension given by $V(x)=\\frac{1}{4}\\left(x^{2}-1\\right)^{2}$ in dimensionless units. In the context of transition events in multiscale materials simulation, the reaction proceeds along a minimal energy path (MEP), and a first-order saddle point governs the activation barrier. The dimer method for saddle-point searches exploits the fact that a saddle point is a stationary point with exactly one direction of negative curvature, aligning a short “dimer” along the direction of lowest curvature and climbing uphill along that direction while relaxing in all orthogonal directions.\n\nStarting only from fundamental definitions—namely, that stationary points satisfy $dV/dx=0$ and that the sign of the second derivative $d^{2}V/dx^{2}$ classifies the nature of the stationary point—carry out the following:\n\n- Determine all stationary points of $V(x)$ and classify each using the second derivative test.\n- Identify the saddle point that connects the two symmetry-related minima via the MEP.\n- Compute the barrier height along the MEP between the minimum at $x=-1$ and the saddle point, expressed as the energy difference $V(x_{\\mathrm{s}})-V(-1)$, where $x_{\\mathrm{s}}$ is the saddle coordinate.\n\nBriefly relate your findings to how the dimer method would operate in this one-dimensional setting by discussing the curvature sign at the saddle and the unique directionality of the dimer orientation. Your final numerical answer must be provided as a row matrix containing the saddle coordinate and the barrier height, $\\left(x_{\\mathrm{s}},V_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)$. Express the barrier height as a pure number (dimensionless). Do not include any units in your final answer.",
            "solution": "The potential energy surface is given by the one-dimensional function $V(x)=\\frac{1}{4}\\left(x^{2}-1\\right)^{2}$. We will analyze this function based on the fundamental definitions provided.\n\nFirst, we determine the stationary points by finding the roots of the first derivative, $\\frac{dV}{dx} = V'(x)$. Using the chain rule:\n$$V'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ \\frac{1}{4}\\left(x^{2}-1\\right)^{2} \\right] = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 2\\left(x^{2}-1\\right) \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(x^{2}-1\\right)$$\n$$V'(x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(x^{2}-1\\right)(2x) = x\\left(x^{2}-1\\right) = x^{3}-x$$\nSetting the first derivative to zero, $V'(x)=0$, yields the stationary points:\n$$x(x^{2}-1) = 0$$\nThis equation has three solutions: $x=0$, $x=1$, and $x=-1$. These are the coordinates of the stationary points.\n\nNext, we classify these stationary points using the second derivative test. The second derivative, $\\frac{d^{2}V}{dx^{2}} = V''(x)$, is:\n$$V''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( x^{3}-x \\right) = 3x^{2}-1$$\nWe evaluate the sign of $V''(x)$ at each stationary point:\n- For $x=-1$:\n$$V''(-1) = 3(-1)^{2}-1 = 3-1 = 2$$\nSince $V''(-1) > 0$, the point at $x=-1$ is a local minimum.\n\n- For $x=0$:\n$$V''(0) = 3(0)^{2}-1 = -1$$\nSince $V''(0)  0$, the point at $x=0$ is a local maximum.\n\n- For $x=1$:\n$$V''(1) = 3(1)^{2}-1 = 3-1 = 2$$\nSince $V''(1) > 0$, the point at $x=1$ is a local minimum.\n\nThe potential $V(x)$ has two minima at $x=-1$ and $x=1$, and a local maximum at $x=0$ that separates them. In the context of transition paths on a potential energy surface, a first-order saddle point is a stationary point that is a maximum along the minimal energy path (MEP) and a minimum in all orthogonal directions. In a one-dimensional system, the local maximum between two minima is the analogue of a saddle point. Therefore, the saddle point that connects the two symmetry-related minima is located at $x_{\\mathrm{s}}=0$.\n\nNow, we compute the barrier height along the MEP between the minimum at $x=-1$ and the saddle point. The barrier height, $V_{\\mathrm{b}}$, is the difference in potential energy between the saddle point and the initial minimum.\nThe potential energy at the minimum $x=-1$ is:\n$$V(-1) = \\frac{1}{4}\\left((-1)^{2}-1\\right)^{2} = \\frac{1}{4}\\left(1-1\\right)^{2} = 0$$\nThe potential energy at the saddle point $x_{\\mathrm{s}}=0$ is:\n$$V(x_{\\mathrm{s}}) = V(0) = \\frac{1}{4}\\left((0)^{2}-1\\right)^{2} = \\frac{1}{4}\\left(-1\\right)^{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\nThe barrier height is then:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{b}} = V(x_{\\mathrm{s}}) - V(-1) = \\frac{1}{4} - 0 = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nFinally, we relate these findings to the dimer method. The dimer method is an algorithm for finding first-order saddle points. It works by orienting a \"dimer\" (two close images of the system) along the direction of lowest curvature of the potential energy surface. The curvature is determined by the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix. At a saddle point, there is exactly one negative eigenvalue, which corresponds to an unstable direction. The method then involves moving the dimer uphill along this unstable direction while minimizing the energy in all orthogonal directions.\n\nIn our one-dimensional case, the \"Hessian\" is simply the scalar second derivative $V''(x)$. The \"curvature\" is $V''(x)$. At the saddle point $x_{\\mathrm{s}}=0$, the curvature is $V''(0) = -1$. The negative sign signifies that this is a direction of negative curvature, i.e., an unstable mode. For a 1D system, there is only one direction, so the task of finding the direction of lowest curvature is trivial. The dimer would be aligned along the $x$-axis, and since the curvature is negative, the method would correctly identify this as the direction along which to ascend to find the saddle point. There are no orthogonal directions, so the relaxation step of the dimer method is absent. The procedure simplifies to finding a local maximum along the single coordinate, which is precisely what the saddle point at $x=0$ represents. The calculation confirms the fundamental feature that the dimer method exploits: a saddle point is characterized by the presence of a unique direction of negative curvature.\n\nThe saddle coordinate is $x_{\\mathrm{s}}=0$, and the barrier height is $V_{\\mathrm{b}}=\\frac{1}{4}$.",

The Hessian simplifies to:\n$$\nH(\\mathbf{0}) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha  0 \\\\ 0  \\beta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe exact curvature is:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{exact}} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{3}{5}  \\frac{4}{5} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha  0 \\\\ 0  \\beta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{3}{5} \\\\ \\frac{4}{5} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{3}{5}  \\frac{4}{5} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{3}{5}\\alpha \\\\ \\frac{4}{5}\\beta \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{9}{25}\\alpha + \\frac{16}{25}\\beta\n$$\nUsing the numerical values:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{exact}} = \\frac{9}{25}(2.6) + \\frac{16}{25}(0.9) = \\frac{23.4 + 14.4}{25} = \\frac{37.8}{25} = 1.512 \\, \\text{eV}/\\mathrm{\\AA}^{2}\n$$\n\n### Accuracy Assessment\nWe calculate the ratio of the absolute errors, $r = \\frac{|k_{d_{2}}-k_{\\mathrm{exact}}|}{|k_{d_{1}}-k_{\\mathrm{exact}}|}$.\nThe absolute error for $d_1 = 0.2$ is:\n$$\n|k_{d_{1}} - k_{\\mathrm{exact}}| = |1.526 - 1.512| = 0.014\n$$\nThe absolute error for $d_2 = 0.1$ is:\n$$\n|k_{d_{2}} - k_{\\mathrm{exact}}| = |1.5155 - 1.512| = 0.0035\n$$\nThe ratio $r$ is:\n$$\nr = \\frac{0.0035}{0.014} = \\frac{35}{140} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25\n$$\nAlternatively, using the analytical error expression derived earlier, $|k_d - k_{\\mathrm{exact}}| = \\gamma d^2$:\n$$\nr = \\frac{\\gamma d_{2}^{2}}{\\gamma d_{1}^{2}} = \\left(\\frac{d_{2}}{d_{1}}\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{0.1}{0.2}\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25\n$$\nThe problem asks for the ratio to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nr = 0.2500\n$$\nThis result is consistent with the second-order accuracy ($O(d^2)$) of the central finite difference scheme used to estimate the curvature, where halving the step size reduces the error by a factor of four.",
