            "problem": "In multiscale materials simulation, continuum-level thermodynamic and transport properties are often computed from the electronic density of states (DOS) and the projected density of states (PDOS) that connect atomistic quantum states to coarse-grained descriptors. Consider a three-dimensional free electron gas in a macroscopically large cubic box of volume $V$ with periodic boundary conditions. The single-particle dispersion relation is $\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k})=\\hbar^{2}|\\mathbf{k}|^{2}/(2m)$, where $m$ is the electron mass and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant. Assume a spin degeneracy factor of $g_{s}=2$.\n\nStarting from first principles suitable for this setting, use the following foundational elements:\n- The DOS is defined as $g(E)=\\frac{dN}{dE}$, where $N(E)$ is the total number of single-particle states with energy less than or equal to $E$.\n- The set of allowed wave vectors $\\mathbf{k}$ forms a uniform grid in $\\mathbf{k}$-space with state density $V/(2\\pi)^{3}$.\n- The volume of a differential spherical shell in $\\mathbf{k}$-space between radius $k$ and $k+dk$ is $4\\pi k^{2}\\,dk$.\n\nDerive the total DOS per unit volume $g(E)/V$ as a function of $E$.\n\nNext, define a projection operator $\\hat{P}$ onto a localized subspace (for example, atomic-orbital-like functions used to construct coarse-grained descriptors).

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the projected density of states (PDOS) per unit volume, $g_{\\mathrm{proj}}(E)/V$, for a three-dimensional free electron gas. The derivation will be conducted from first principles, beginning with the calculation of the total density of states (DOS) and subsequently applying the concept of a projection weight.\n\nFirst, we derive the total density of states per unit volume, $g(E)/V$. The number of single-particle states, $dN$, within a small interval of energy $dE$ is related to the volume of a shell in $\\mathbf{k}$-space. The problem states that the dispersion relation is isotropic, $\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k})=\\hbar^{2}|\\mathbf{k}|^{2}/(2m)$, so surfaces of constant energy are spheres in $\\mathbf{k}$-space.\n\nLet $k$ be the magnitude of the wave vector $\\mathbf{k}$. The number of orbital states in a spherical shell of radius $k$ and thickness $dk$ in $\\mathbf{k}$-space is given by the product of the state density in $\\mathbf{k}$-space and the volume of the shell.\nThe state density in $\\mathbf{k}$-space is given as $V/(2\\pi)^{3}$. The volume of the spherical shell is $4\\pi k^{2}\\,dk$.\nThe number of orbital states in this shell is therefore $\\frac{V}{(2\\pi)^{3}} (4\\pi k^{2}\\,dk)$.\nEach orbital state can be occupied by two electrons with opposite spins, so we must include the spin degeneracy factor $g_s=2$. The total number of single-particle states, $dN$, in this shell is:\n$$dN = g_s \\frac{V}{(2\\pi)^{3}} (4\\pi k^{2}\\,dk) = 2 \\frac{V}{8\\pi^{3}} (4\\pi k^{2}\\,dk) = \\frac{V}{\\pi^{2}} k^{2}\\,dk$$\nThe density of states, $g(E)$, is defined as $g(E) = dN/dE$. We can write this relation as $g(E) = \\frac{dN}{dk}\\frac{dk}{dE}$. From the expression for $dN$, we have $\\frac{dN}{dk} = \\frac{V}{\\pi^{2}} k^{2}$.\n\nTo find $\\frac{dk}{dE}$, we use the dispersion relation $E = \\epsilon(k) = \\frac{\\hbar^{2}k^{2}}{2m}$. Differentiating $E$ with respect to $k$ yields:\n$$\\frac{dE}{dk} = \\frac{d}{dk}\\left(\\frac{\\hbar^{2}k^{2}}{2m}\\right) = \\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}(2k) = \\frac{\\hbar^{2}k}{m}$$\nTherefore, $\\frac{dk}{dE} = \\left(\\frac{dE}{dk}\\right)^{-1} = \\frac{m}{\\hbar^{2}k}$.\n\nNow we can express $g(E)$ as:\n$$g(E) = \\frac{dN}{dE} = \\left(\\frac{V}{\\pi^{2}} k^{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{m}{\\hbar^{2}k}\\right) = \\frac{Vm}{\\pi^{2}\\hbar^{2}} k$$\nTo express the DOS as a function of energy $E$, we must substitute for $k$. From the dispersion relation, $k^{2} = \\frac{2mE}{\\hbar^{2}}$, which gives $k = \\left(\\frac{2mE}{\\hbar^{2}}\\right)^{1/2}$ for $E \\geq 0$. Substituting this into the expression for $g(E)$:\n$$g(E) = \\frac{Vm}{\\pi^{2}\\hbar^{2}} \\left(\\frac{2mE}{\\hbar^{2}}\\right)^{1/2} = \\frac{Vm}{\\pi^{2}\\hbar^{2}} \\frac{\\sqrt{2m}}{\\hbar} E^{1/2} = \\frac{V(2m)^{3/2}}{2\\pi^{2}\\hbar^{3}} E^{1/2}$$\nThe total DOS per unit volume, $g(E)/V$, is then:\n$$\\frac{g(E)}{V} = \\frac{(2m)^{3/2}}{2\\pi^{2}\\hbar^{3}} E^{1/2} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi^{2}} \\left(\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^{2}}\\right)^{3/2} E^{1/2}$$\n\nNext, we derive the projected density of states, $g_{\\mathrm{proj}}(E)$. The PDOS is a weighted measure of the density of states. For each state $|\\psi_{\\mathbf{k}}\\rangle$, its contribution to the PDOS is weighted by $w(\\mathbf{k}) = \\langle \\psi_{\\mathbf{k}}|\\hat{P}|\\psi_{\\mathbf{k}}\\rangle$. The PDOS can be formally defined as:\n$$g_{\\mathrm{proj}}(E) = \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}, s} w(\\mathbf{k}) \\delta(E - \\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}))$$\nwhere the sum is over all states (wave vector $\\mathbf{k}$ and spin $s$). Converting the sum to an integral over $\\mathbf{k}$-space:\n$$g_{\\mathrm{proj}}(E) = \\int g_s \\frac{V}{(2\\pi)^{3}} w(\\mathbf{k}) \\delta(E - \\epsilon(\\mathbf{k})) d^{3}k$$\nThe problem states that the projection weight $w(\\mathbf{k})$ is a constant, $w$, for the energy range of interest. Since $w$ does not depend on $\\mathbf{k}$, it can be factored out of the integral:\n$$g_{\\mathrm{proj}}(E) = w \\left( \\int g_s \\frac{V}{(2\\pi)^{3}} \\delta(E - \\epsilon(\\mathbf{k})) d^{3}k \\right)$$\nThe expression inside the parentheses is precisely the definition of the total density of states, $g(E)$.\nTherefore, the projected density of states is simply the total density of states scaled by the constant projection weight $w$:\n$$g_{\\mathrm{proj}}(E) = w \\cdot g(E)$$\nTo find the projected density of states per unit volume, we divide by $V$:\n$$\\frac{g_{\\mathrm{proj}}(E)}{V} = w \\cdot \\frac{g(E)}{V}$$\nSubstituting the previously derived expression for the total DOS per unit volume gives the final answer:\n$$\\frac{g_{\\mathrm{proj}}(E)}{V} = w \\frac{1}{2\\pi^{2}} \\left(\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^{2}}\\right)^{3/2} E^{1/2}$$\nThis expression represents the contribution of the states to the density of states within the subspace defined by the projection operator $\\hat{P}$, as a function of energy $E$, for the given free electron gas model.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the total number of occupied valence states per primitive cell, $N_v$, for a model of crystalline silicon. This quantity is defined by the integral of the valence density of states (DOS), $G_v(E)$, from negative infinity up to the Fermi level, $E_F$. The calculation is performed at zero temperature, where the occupation function is a step function, meaning all states with energy $E \\le E_F$ are occupied and all states with $E  E_F$ are empty.\n\nThe problem provides the following expression for the number of valence states:\n$$\nN_{v}=\\int_{-\\infty}^{E_{F}}G_{v}(E)\\,dE\n$$\nThe Fermi level is given as $E_F = 0\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.

Each integral involves the triangular shape function $T(E; E_0, w)$, which is non-zero only on the finite interval $[E_0 - w, E_0 + w]$. The integral of this function over its entire support represents the area of a triangle with base $2w$ and height $1$, which is $\\frac{1}{2}(2w)(1) = w$.\n\nLet's first evaluate the integral for the $s$-like component:\n$$\nI_s = \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} T\\!\\left(E;E_{s},w_{s}\\right)\\,dE\n$$\nThe parameters for the $s$-like component are $E_s = -8\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and $w_s = 2\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.

The upper boundary of the support coincides with the Fermi level. The integral therefore covers the full triangular function. Its value is the area of the triangle, equal to the half-width $w_p$.\n$$\nI_p = \\int_{-6}^{0} T\\!\\left(E;-3,3\\right)\\,dE = w_p = 3\\,\\mathrm{eV}\n$$\nSimilar to the $s$-component, the value of the integral is a dimensionless number, $I_p = 3$.\n\nNow we can substitute these results back into the expression for $N_v$.

Crystalline silicon has a core-valence partitioning of $[Ne]3s^23p^2$, meaning each silicon atom contributes $4$ valence electrons. The primitive cell of the diamond structure contains $2$ atoms. Therefore, the nominal valence electron count per primitive cell is $2 \\text{ atoms} \\times 4 \\text{ electrons/atom} = 8 \\text{ electrons}$.\nAt zero temperature, the number of occupied states must equal the number of electrons. Our calculated value $N_v = 8$ is perfectly consistent with the nominal valence electron count of $8$ for the primitive cell. This confirms the self-consistency of the provided DOS model. The parameters $C_s$ and $C_p$ have been defined such that integrating the respective projected DOS components yields the correct number of states for the $s$-like and $p$-like bands in this simplified model.\nNumber of $s$-like states: $2 C_s w_s = 2 \\times 0.5 \\times 2 = 2$.\nNumber of $p$-like states: $2 C_p w_p = 2 \\times 1.0 \\times 3 = 6$.\nTotal states = $2+6=8$.",

The Brillouin-zone is sampled by a uniform $\\Gamma$-centered grid with $N \\times N \\times N$ points. The density of states (DOS) and projected density of states (PDOS) are computed by replacing the Dirac delta distribution $\\delta(E - E_{n\\mathbf{k}})$ with a Lorentzian $L_{\\eta}(E - E_{n\\mathbf{k}})$ of half-width at half-maximum (HWHM) $\\eta$, where the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) is $2\\eta$.

The choice of the broadening parameter $\\eta$ involves a critical trade-off between two competing sources of error.\n\n**(i) Resolution Loss:** The Lorentzian broadening smears out the energy spectrum. Any sharp features in the true DOS will be convoluted with the Lorentzian profile. The finest detail that can be resolved is limited by the FWHM of the broadening function, $2\\eta$. To achieve a target resolution of $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{target}}$, $\\eta$ must be sufficiently small. An error arises from the broadening-induced loss of resolution, which can be quantified relative to the target resolution. The problem defines this error component as $(\\frac{2\\eta}{\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{target}}})^2$. A smaller $\\eta$ reduces this error.\n\n**(ii) k-point Sampling Aliasing:** The Brillouin zone is sampled with a finite grid, leading to a discrete set of energy eigenvalues $E(\\mathbf{k}_i)$. The energy dispersion between adjacent $\\mathbf{k}$-points is not captured. The characteristic energy spacing due to this discretization can be estimated. For a $k$-point spacing of $\\Delta k$, the maximum energy variation is approximately $\\Delta E \\approx |\\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} E(\\mathbf{k})| \\Delta k$.

If the broadening FWHM $2\\eta$ is much smaller than $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{disp}}$, the calculated DOS will exhibit spurious, sharp peaks corresponding to the discrete energy levels, rather than a smooth continuum.

The $k$-point spacing is $\\Delta k = \\frac{2\\pi}{a N}$.\nGiven values are:\n-   $a = 3.2 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\text{m}$\n-   $N = 128$\n-   $v_{\\max} = 3.0 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n-   $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{target}} = 0.030\\,\\text{eV}$\n-   $\\hbar = 6.582119569 \\times 10^{-16}\\,\\text{eV}\\,\\text{s}$\n\nThe $k$-point spacing $\\Delta k$ is:\n$$\\Delta k = \\frac{2\\pi}{a N} = \\frac{2\\pi}{(3.2 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\text{m}) \\times 128} = \\frac{2\\pi}{4.096 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\text{m}} \\approx 1.53398 \\times 10^8\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$$\nNext, we calculate the dispersion energy scale $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{disp}}$:\n$$\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{disp}} = \\hbar v_{\\max} \\Delta k = (6.582119569 \\times 10^{-16}\\,\\text{eV}\\,\\text{s}) \\times (3.0 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}) \\times \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{4.096 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\text{m}}\\right)$$\n$$\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{disp}} = \\frac{(6.582119569 \\times 3.0 \\times 2\\pi) \\times 10^{-11}}{4.096 \\times 10^{-8}}\\,\\text{eV} \\approx \\frac{1.24057 \\times 10^{-10}}{4.096 \\times 10^{-8}}\\,\\text{eV} \\approx 0.0302874\\,\\text{eV}$$\nFinally, we calculate the optimal broadening parameter $\\eta_{\\text{opt}}$:\n$$\\eta_{\\text{opt}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{target}} \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{disp}}}$$\n$$\\eta_{\\text{opt}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{(0.030\\,\\text{eV}) \\times (0.0302874\\,\\text{eV})} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{0.000908622}\\,\\text{eV}^2$$\n$$\\eta_{\\text{opt}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{9.08622 \\times 10^{-4}}\\,\\text{eV} \\approx \\frac{1}{2} (0.03014336)\\,\\text{eV} \\approx 0.01507168\\,\\text{eV}$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, as requested:\n$$\\eta_{\\text{opt}} \\approx 0.0151\\,\\text{eV}$$",
