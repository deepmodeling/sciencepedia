This exercise provides hands-on practice in translating this parameter into a finite set of plane waves for a given crystal geometry, a fundamental skill for understanding and controlling the accuracy of electronic structure simulations. You will implement the procedure for generating and ordering the reciprocal lattice vectors that constitute the basis, providing a concrete understanding of how the basis is constructed in practice.

The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary physical constants, mathematical definitions, and numerical tolerances to determine a unique, verifiable solution. The language is objective and the requirements are unambiguous.\n\nThe primary objective is to identify the set of plane-wave basis functions, indexed by integer triplets $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$, that satisfy a given kinetic energy cutoff, $E_{\\mathrm{cut}}$. The basis functions are considered at the $\\Gamma$-point of the Brillouin zone, corresponding to a crystal wavevector $\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{0}$.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the kinetic energy of a plane wave and its corresponding integer triplet. The time-independent Schrödinger equation for a free electron of mass $m$ is governed by the kinetic-energy operator $\\hat{T} = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2$.

To handle floating-point precision at the boundary, this condition is implemented using a tolerance:\n$$\nE_{n_x,n_y,n_z} \\le E_{\\mathrm{cut,eff}} \\quad \\text{where} \\quad E_{\\mathrm{cut,eff}} = E_{\\mathrm{cut}}(1 + \\delta_{\\mathrm{rel}}) + \\delta_{\\mathrm{abs}}\n$$\nwith $\\delta_{\\mathrm{rel}}=10^{-12}$ and $\\delta_{\\mathrm{abs}}=10^{-32}$ J.\n\nThe algorithmic procedure to solve the problem for each test case is as follows:\n$1$. **Initialization**: For a given test case $(L_x, L_y, L_z, E_{\\mathrm{cut}})$, the effective energy cutoff $E_{\\mathrm{cut,eff}}$ is computed. The constant prefactor $C_{\\text{factor}} = \\frac{2\\pi^2\\hbar^2}{m}$ is also calculated.

This avoids searching a much larger rectangular volume.\n- The maximum possible value for $|n_x|$ is found by setting $n_y=0$ and $n_z=0$: $n_{x,\\max} = \\lfloor L_x \\sqrt{E_{\\mathrm{cut,eff}} / C_{\\text{factor}}} \\rfloor$. We iterate $n_x$ from $-n_{x,\\max}$ to $n_{x,\\max}$.\n- For each $n_x$, the maximum possible value for $|n_y|$ is found by setting $n_z=0$: $n_{y,\\max}(n_x) = \\lfloor L_y \\sqrt{E_{\\mathrm{cut,eff}}/C_{\\text{factor}} - n_x^2/L_x^2} \\rfloor$. We iterate $n_y$ from $-n_{y,\\max}(n_x)$ to $n_{y,\\max}(n_x)$.\n- For each pair $(n_x, n_y)$, the maximum possible value for $|n_z|$ is: $n_{z,\\max}(n_x, n_y) = \\lfloor L_z \\sqrt{E_{\\mathrm{cut,eff}}/C_{\\text{factor}} - n_x^2/L_x^2 - n_y^2/L_y^2} \\rfloor$. We iterate $n_z$ from $-n_{z,\\max}(n_x, n_y)$ to $n_{z,\\max}(n_x, n_y)$.\nEvery triplet $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ generated by this procedure is guaranteed to satisfy the energy cutoff condition. These valid triplets are collected.\n\n$3$. **Sorting**: The collected triplets must be sorted according to the specified criteria.\n- **Primary key**: The exact kinetic energy $E_{n_x,n_y,n_z}$ (calculated without the tolerance factors), in ascending order.\n- **Secondary key**: For triplets with degenerate (identical) energies, a tie is broken by sorting them in ascending lexicographical order of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$.\nThis is achieved by creating a list of tuples of the form $(E_{n_x,n_y,n_z}, n_x, n_y, n_z)$ for each valid triplet and then performing a standard sort on this list.\n\n$4$. **Finalization**: After sorting, the ordered list of triplets is extracted. The final result for the test case consists of the total count of the valid triplets and the ordered list of these triplets. This process is repeated for all test cases provided.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the energy band gap at the first Brillouin zone boundary for a one-dimensional nearly-free electron model with a specific periodic potential.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Electron mass: $m$\n- Spatial dimension: $1$\n- Periodic potential: $V(x) = 2V_{G}\\cos(Gx)$\n- Reciprocal lattice vector magnitude: $G$\n- Lattice spacing: $a=2\\pi/G$\n- Potential Fourier amplitude: $V_{G}$ is a real constant\n- Time-independent Schrödinger equation (TISE): $-\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}}\\psi(x)+V(x)\\psi(x)=E\\psi(x)$\n- Basis set for truncation: $\\{|k-G\\rangle, |k\\rangle, |k+G\\rangle\\}$, which corresponds to plane waves $\\{\\exp(\\mathrm{i}(k-G)x), \\exp(\\mathrm{i}kx), \\exp(\\mathrm{i}(k+G)x)\\}$\n- Point of interest: boundary of the first Brillouin zone, $k=G/2$\n- Method: degenerate perturbation theory\n- Assumption: $|V_{G}|$ is small compared to free-electron kinetic energies away from the degeneracy.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem describes the nearly-free electron model, a fundamental concept in solid-state physics used to explain electronic band structures. It utilizes the Schrödinger equation, Fourier analysis, and perturbation theory, all of which are standard, well-established theoretical tools. The potential $V(x) = 2V_{G}\\cos(Gx)$ is a canonical example of a simple periodic potential. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** All necessary information is provided. The potential, the basis set, the Hamiltonian, the specific point in k-space ($k=G/2$), and the theoretical framework (degenerate perturbation theory) are explicitly defined. This allows for the derivation of a unique, meaningful solution for the band gap.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, formal, and unbiased language, free from any subjective or speculative content.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe Hamiltonian operator is $H = T + V$, where $T = -\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}}$ is the kinetic energy operator and $V(x)$ is the potential energy operator. We need to find the matrix representation of $H$ in the given basis $\\{|k-G\\rangle, |k\\rangle, |k+G\\rangle\\}$. Let's denote the basis states as $|1\\rangle = |k-G\\rangle$, $|2\\rangle = |k\\rangle$, and $|3\\rangle = |k+G\\rangle$. The matrix elements are $H_{ij} = \\langle i | H | j \\rangle$.\n\nThe kinetic energy operator $T$ is diagonal in the plane-wave basis. A plane wave $|\\kappa\\rangle = \\exp(\\mathrm{i}\\kappa x)$ is an eigenstate of $T$ with eigenvalue $E_{\\kappa}^{0} = \\frac{\\hbar^{2}\\kappa^{2}}{2m}$. Therefore, the kinetic part of the Hamiltonian matrix is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{T} = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\hbar^{2}(k-G)^{2}}{2m} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\frac{\\hbar^{2}k^{2}}{2m} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\frac{\\hbar^{2}(k+G)^{2}}{2m}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nNext, we evaluate the matrix elements of the potential $V(x)$. The potential is given by $V(x) = 2V_{G}\\cos(Gx)$. We can express this using complex exponentials:\n$$\nV(x) = 2V_{G} \\left(\\frac{\\exp(\\mathrm{i}Gx) + \\exp(-\\mathrm{i}Gx)}{2}\\right) = V_{G}\\exp(\\mathrm{i}Gx) + V_{G}\\exp(-\\mathrm{i}Gx)\n$$\nThe matrix element $V_{ij} = \\langle k_i | V(x) | k_j \\rangle$ is given by the integral (ignoring normalization factors which cancel):\n$$\nV_{ij} \\propto \\int V(x) \\exp(-\\mathrm{i}k_i x) \\exp(\\mathrm{i}k_j x) dx = \\int V(x) \\exp(\\mathrm{i}(k_j - k_i)x) dx\n$$\nThis integral is proportional to the Fourier coefficient of $V(x)$ at the wavevector $q = k_i - k_j$. From the form of $V(x)$, the only non-zero Fourier coefficients correspond to $q = G$ and $q = -G$, and both are equal to $V_{G}$ (since $V_G$ is real).\nLet's compute the elements of the potential matrix $\\mathbf{V}$:\n- Diagonal elements: $V_{11}$, $V_{22}$, $V_{33}$ correspond to $q = 0$. Since the $q=0$ Fourier component of $V(x)$ is zero, these elements are zero.\n- Off-diagonal elements:\n    - $V_{12} = \\langle k-G | V | k \\rangle$: The wavevector difference is $k - (k-G) = G$. The Fourier coefficient is $V_G$.\n    - $V_{21} = \\langle k | V | k-G \\rangle$: The wavevector difference is $(k-G) - k = -G$. The Fourier coefficient is $V_{-G} = V_G$.\n    - $V_{23} = \\langle k | V | k+G \\rangle$: The wavevector difference is $(k+G) - k = G$. The Fourier coefficient is $V_G$.\n    - $V_{32} = \\langle k+G | V | k \\rangle$: The wavevector difference is $k - (k+G) = -G$. The Fourier coefficient is $V_{-G} = V_G$.\n    - $V_{13} = \\langle k-G | V | k+G \\rangle$: The wavevector difference is $(k+G) - (k-G) = 2G$. The corresponding Fourier coefficient is zero.\n    - $V_{31} = \\langle k+G | V | k-G \\rangle$: The wavevector difference is $(k-G) - (k+G) = -2G$. The corresponding Fourier coefficient is zero.\n\nSo, the potential matrix is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{V} = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & V_{G} & 0 \\\\\nV_{G} & 0 & V_{G} \\\\\n0 & V_{G} & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe full Hamiltonian matrix $\\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{T} + \\mathbf{V}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{H} = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\hbar^{2}(k-G)^{2}}{2m} & V_{G} & 0 \\\\\nV_{G} & \\frac{\\hbar^{2}k^{2}}{2m} & V_{G} \\\\\n0 & V_{G} & \\frac{\\hbar^{2}(k+G)^{2}}{2m}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the band gap at the boundary of the first Brillouin zone, which occurs at $k=G/2$. At this point, the unperturbed free-electron energies (the diagonal elements of $\\mathbf{H}$) are:\n- $E_{k-G}^{0} = \\frac{\\hbar^{2}(G/2-G)^{2}}{2m} = \\frac{\\hbar^{2}(-G/2)^{2}}{2m} = \\frac{\\hbar^{2}G^{2}}{8m}$\n- $E_{k}^{0} = \\frac{\\hbar^{2}(G/2)^{2}}{2m} = \\frac{\\hbar^{2}G^{2}}{8m}$\n- $E_{k+G}^{0} = \\frac{\\hbar^{2}(G/2+G)^{2}}{2m} = \\frac{\\hbar^{2}(3G/2)^{2}}{2m} = \\frac{9\\hbar^{2}G^{2}}{8m}$\n\nWe observe that the unperturbed states $|k-G\\rangle = |-G/2\\rangle$ and $|k\\rangle = |G/2\\rangle$ are degenerate in energy: $E_{-G/2}^{0} = E_{G/2}^{0} = \\frac{\\hbar^{2}G^{2}}{8m}$. The state $|k+G\\rangle = |3G/2\\rangle$ has a much higher energy and is not part of this degeneracy.\n\nAccording to degenerate perturbation theory, we must diagonalize the Hamiltonian within the degenerate subspace spanned by $\\{|k-G\\rangle, |k\\rangle\\}$. The relevant $2\\times2$ submatrix of $\\mathbf{H}$ at $k=G/2$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{H}_{\\text{deg}} = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\hbar^{2}G^{2}}{8m} & V_{G} \\\\\nV_{G} & \\frac{\\hbar^{2}G^{2}}{8m}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTo find the energy eigenvalues $E$, we solve the characteristic equation $\\det(\\mathbf{H}_{\\text{deg}} - E\\mathbf{I}) = 0$:\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\hbar^{2}G^{2}}{8m} - E & V_{G} \\\\\nV_{G} & \\frac{\\hbar^{2}G^{2}}{8m} - E\n\\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\hbar^{2}G^{2}}{8m} - E\\right)^{2} - V_{G}^{2} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\hbar^{2}G^{2}}{8m} - E = \\pm \\sqrt{V_G^2} = \\pm |V_{G}|\n$$\nThis gives two energy eigenvalues, which are the energies of the states at the Brillouin zone boundary after the perturbation has been applied:\n$$\nE_{\\pm} = \\frac{\\hbar^{2}G^{2}}{8m} \\pm |V_{G}|\n$$\nThe perturbation lifts the degeneracy, splitting the single energy level into two. The lower energy, $E_{-} = \\frac{\\hbar^{2}G^{2}}{8m} - |V_{G}|$, corresponds to the top of the first (lowest) energy band. The higher energy, $E_{+} = \\frac{\\hbar^{2}G^{2}}{8m} + |V_{G}|$, corresponds to the bottom of the second energy band.\n\nThe energy band gap, $E_g$, is the difference between these two energy levels:\n$$\nE_g = E_{+} - E_{-} = \\left(\\frac{\\hbar^{2}G^{2}}{8m} + |V_{G}|\\right) - \\left(\\frac{\\hbar^{2}G^{2}}{8m} - |V_{G}|\\right)\n$$\n$$\nE_g = |V_{G}| - (-|V_{G}|) = 2|V_{G}|\n$$\nThe final answer is expressed solely in terms of the given parameter $V_G$. The absolute value is necessary because an energy gap is a non-negative quantity, and $V_G$ is defined only as a real constant, which could be negative.",

            "problem": "You are asked to study the convergence of the indirect band gap of crystalline silicon with respect to the plane-wave kinetic energy cutoff and the density of the crystal momentum sampling mesh. For computational tractability while retaining key physics of a plane-wave basis and Bragg scattering, use a simplified three-dimensional nearly-free-electron model with a cosine periodic potential on a simple cubic Bravais lattice, which captures an indirect gap via coupling at the Brillouin zone boundary. The task is to implement a complete program that constructs the single-electron Hamiltonian in a plane-wave basis at each crystal momentum point, diagonalizes it to obtain the lowest two energy bands, and estimates the indirect band gap as the difference between the minimum of the second band and the maximum of the first band across sampled crystal momentum points. All energies must be reported in electronvolts, and all lengths in angstroms.\n\nDefinitions and model:\n- Let the lattice parameter be $a = 5.43\\,\\text{\\AA}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been subjected to rigorous validation and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to proceed with a unique and verifiable solution. It represents a standard, albeit simplified, problem in computational solid-state physics, suitable for illustrating the principles of electronic band structure calculation using a plane-wave basis set. We shall now proceed to the solution.\n\nThe fundamental task is to solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a single electron in a periodic potential, $\\hat{H}\\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = E\\psi(\\mathbf{r})$, where the Hamiltonian is $\\hat{H} = \\hat{T} + \\hat{V} = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_e}\\nabla^2 + V(\\mathbf{r})$. The periodicity of the potential, $V(\\mathbf{r}) = V(\\mathbf{r}+\\mathbf{R})$ for any direct lattice vector $\\mathbf{R}$, imposes a specific structure on the eigenstates. According to Bloch's theorem, the solutions can be written in the form $\\psi_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{r}) = e^{i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}}u_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{r})$, where $\\mathbf{k}$ is a crystal momentum vector in the first Brillouin zone and $u_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{r})$ is a cell-periodic function, $u_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{r}) = u_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{r}+\\mathbf{R})$.\n\nGiven that $u_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{r})$ is periodic, it can be expanded in a Fourier series over the reciprocal lattice vectors $\\mathbf{G}$: $u_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_{\\mathbf{G}} c_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{G}) e^{i\\mathbf{G}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}}$. Substituting this into the Bloch form for the wavefunction gives the plane-wave expansion:\n$$\n\\psi_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_{\\mathbf{G}} c_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{G}) e^{i(\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{G})\\cdot\\mathbf{r}}\n$$\nInserting this expansion into the Schrödinger equation transforms it into an infinite-dimensional matrix eigenvalue problem for the coefficients $c_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{G})$ for each $\\mathbf{k}$. The matrix elements of the Hamiltonian in this plane-wave basis $|\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{G}\\rangle$ are given by $H_{\\mathbf{G},\\mathbf{G}'}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\langle \\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{G} | \\hat{H} | \\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{G}' \\rangle$.\n\nThe kinetic energy operator $\\hat{T}$ is diagonal in this basis:\n$$\n\\langle \\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{G} | \\hat{T} | \\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{G}' \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar^2 |\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{G}|^2}{2m_e} \\delta_{\\mathbf{G},\\mathbf{G}'}\n$$\nThe potential energy operator $\\hat{V}$ has matrix elements determined by the Fourier coefficients of the potential, $V(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_{\\mathbf{G}} V_{\\mathbf{G}} e^{i\\mathbf{G}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}}$:\n$$\n\\langle \\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{G} | \\hat{V} | \\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{G}' \\rangle = V_{\\mathbf{G}-\\mathbf{G}'}\n$$\nCombining these, the full Hamiltonian matrix elements are:\n$$\nH_{\\mathbf{G},\\mathbf{G}'}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 |\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{G}|^2}{2m_e} \\delta_{\\mathbf{G},\\mathbf{G}'} + V_{\\mathbf{G}-\\mathbf{G}'}\n$$\nThe problem specifies a simple cubic Bravais lattice with lattice parameter $a = 5.43\\,\\text{\\AA}$. The reciprocal lattice is also simple cubic, with primitive vectors $\\mathbf{b}_1 = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$, $\\mathbf{b}_2 = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$, and $\\mathbf{b}_3 = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. A general reciprocal lattice vector is $\\mathbf{G}_{\\mathbf{n}} = n_x \\mathbf{b}_1 + n_y \\mathbf{b}_2 + n_z \\mathbf{b}_3$ for an integer vector $\\mathbf{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$.\n\nThe periodic potential is $V(\\mathbf{r}) = 2 V_c \\left[\\cos\\left(\\mathbf{b}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{r}\\right) + \\cos\\left(\\mathbf{b}_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{r}\\right) + \\cos\\left(\\mathbf{b}_3 \\cdot \\mathbf{r}\\right)\\right]$. Using Euler's formula, $\\cos(x) = (e^{ix}+e^{-ix})/2$, we identify its non-zero Fourier coefficients as $V_{\\mathbf{G}} = V_c$ for $\\mathbf{G} \\in \\{\\pm\\mathbf{b}_1, \\pm\\mathbf{b}_2, \\pm\\mathbf{b}_3\\}$ and $V_{\\mathbf{G}} = 0$ for all other $\\mathbf{G} \\ne 0$. The average potential $V_{\\mathbf{G}=0}$ is zero. This implies that the potential couples a plane wave $|\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{G}_{\\mathbf{n}}\\rangle$ only to plane waves $|\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{G}_{\\mathbf{m}}\\rangle$ where the difference $\\mathbf{G}_{\\mathbf{n}}-\\mathbf{G}_{\\mathbf{m}}$ is one of the six shortest non-zero reciprocal lattice vectors. This corresponds to the condition that $\\mathbf{n}-\\mathbf{m}$ is one of $\\pm(1,0,0)$, $\\pm(0,1,0)$, or $\\pm(0,0,1)$.\n\nIn a practical computation, the infinite basis must be truncated. This is achieved via a kinetic energy cutoff, $E_{\\text{cut}}$. For each crystal momentum $\\mathbf{k}$, we include in our basis only those plane waves $|\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{G}_{\\mathbf{n}}\\rangle$ for which the kinetic energy is below the cutoff:\n$$\nT(\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{G}_{\\mathbf{n}}) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 |\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{G}_{\\mathbf{n}}|^2}{2m_e} \\le E_{\\text{cut}}\n$$\nThis results in a finite-dimensional, $\\mathbf{k}$-dependent Hamiltonian matrix $H(\\mathbf{k})$, whose elements are precisely those specified in the problem statement. The eigenvalues of this matrix, $E_1(\\mathbf{k}) \\le E_2(\\mathbf{k}) \\le \\dots$, constitute the electronic band structure.\n\nThe computational algorithm is as follows:\n1.  For each given pair of parameters $(E_{\\text{cut}}, N_k)$, initialize the calculation. The required physical constants are $a = 5.43\\,\\text{\\AA}$, $\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_e} = 3.8099819442818976\\,\\text{eV}\\cdot\\text{\\AA}^2$, and $V_c = -1.25\\,\\text{eV}$.\n2.  Generate the uniform grid of $N_k^3$ crystal momentum vectors $\\mathbf{k}$ sampling the first Brillouin zone according to the rule $k_i(j) = -\\frac{\\pi}{a} + \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\,\\frac{j}{N_k}$ for $j=0, \\dots, N_k-1$.\n3.  For each $\\mathbf{k}$ vector in the grid:\n    a. Determine the finite set of integer vectors $\\mathbf{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that satisfy the kinetic energy cutoff condition. This is done by searching a sufficiently large cubic range of integers $\\mathbf{n}$ and retaining those that satisfy $T(\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{G}_{\\mathbf{n}}) \\le E_{\\text{cut}}$.\n    b. If the basis set is empty, no eigenvalues can be computed for this $\\mathbf{k}$. Proceed to the next $\\mathbf{k}$.\n    c. If the basis is non-empty, construct the Hamiltonian matrix $H(\\mathbf{k})$ of size $N_{basis} \\times N_{basis}$. The diagonal elements are $H_{\\mathbf{n},\\mathbf{n}}(\\mathbf{k}) = T(\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{G}_{\\mathbf{n}})$. The off-diagonal element $H_{\\mathbf{n},\\mathbf{m}}(\\mathbf{k})$ is $V_c$ if $\\mathbf{n}-\\mathbf{m}$ is a unit vector in one of the six Cartesian directions, and $0$ otherwise.\n    d. The resulting matrix is Hermitian. Diagonalize it to find its real eigenvalues. The eigenvalues are sorted in ascending order: $E_1(\\mathbf{k}) \\le E_2(\\mathbf{k}) \\le \\dots \\le E_{N_{basis}}(\\mathbf{k})$.\n    e. Collect the first eigenvalue $E_1(\\mathbf{k})$ and, if it exists, the second eigenvalue $E_2(\\mathbf{k})$.\n4.  After iterating through all $\\mathbf{k}$ points, determine the valence band maximum, $E_v = \\max_{\\mathbf{k}} E_1(\\mathbf{k})$, where the maximum is taken over all $\\mathbf{k}$ points that yielded at least one eigenvalue.\n5.  Similarly, determine the conduction band minimum, $E_c = \\min_{\\mathbf{k}} E_2(\\mathbf{k})$, where the minimum is taken over all $\\mathbf{k}$ points that yielded at least two eigenvalues.\n6.  If $E_c$ could not be determined (i.e., no $\\mathbf{k}$ point produced a basis of size two or greater), the band gap $E_g$ is undefined. Otherwise, calculate the indirect band gap as $E_g = E_c - E_v$.\n7.  This procedure is repeated for all five test cases, and the results are reported in the specified format. This systematic process ensures a correct and reproducible numerical solution to the problem as stated.",
