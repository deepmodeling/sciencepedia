            "problem": "Consider a three-dimensional Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation of a coarse-grained fluid in which each molecule is treated as a rigid body. Let there be $N$ molecules in total, and suppose $M$ of them are linear rigid bodies (for which rotations around the molecular axis carry no kinetic energy due to a vanishing principal moment of inertia), while the remaining $N - M$ are non-linear rigid bodies. The rigid-body kinetic energy of molecule $i$ is the sum of a translational quadratic form and a rotational quadratic form, each defined by a positive semi-definite mass matrix; for a linear rigid body the rotational inertia tensor has rank $2$, whereas for a non-linear rigid body it has rank $3$. The numerical integrator removes the total linear momentum at every step so that the center-of-mass velocity of the entire system is identically zero. The system is coupled to a Nosé–Hoover thermostat to sample the canonical ensemble at temperature $T$, where $T$ is the thermodynamic temperature and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant ($k_B$).\n\nStarting only from the equipartition principle for quadratic degrees of freedom in the canonical ensemble and from the rigid-body structure of the kinetic energy, determine the effective number of quadratic degrees of freedom that contribute to kinetic energy in this system. Then use this number to write, in closed form, the target kinetic energy that appears in the thermostat’s energy-matching condition required to enforce the canonical temperature.

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the target kinetic energy for a system of $N$ rigid molecules coupled to a Nosé–Hoover thermostat, which is designed to maintain a constant average temperature $T$. This target kinetic energy is the ensemble average of the system's kinetic energy, $\\langle K \\rangle$, in the canonical ensemble. The equipartition principle of classical statistical mechanics states that, for a system in thermal equilibrium, every quadratic degree of freedom in the Hamiltonian contributes an average energy of $\\frac{1}{2} k_B T$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. Therefore, the task reduces to finding the total number of effective quadratic degrees of freedom, $N_{dof}$, that contribute to the kinetic energy of the system. The target kinetic energy will then be given by the expression:\n$$ \\langle K \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} N_{dof} k_B T $$\n\nThe total kinetic energy $K$ of the system is the sum of the kinetic energies of all $N$ molecules. Each molecule's kinetic energy is a sum of its translational and rotational kinetic energies. We must determine the number of independent quadratic terms in this total sum.\n\nFirst, we consider the translational degrees of freedom. Each of the $N$ molecules is a point mass with respect to its translational motion in a $3$-dimensional space. The translational kinetic energy of a single molecule $i$ with mass $m_i$ and velocity $\\mathbf{v}_i = (v_{ix}, v_{iy}, v_{iz})$ is given by:\n$$ K_{i, \\text{trans}} = \\frac{1}{2} m_i |\\mathbf{v}_i|^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m_i (v_{ix}^2 + v_{iy}^2 + v_{iz}^2) $$\nThis expression contains $3$ quadratic terms in the velocity components. For a system of $N$ molecules, there would nominally be $3N$ translational degrees of freedom. However, the problem states a constraint: the total linear momentum of the system is held at zero. This corresponds to setting the velocity of the center-of-mass to zero. The total linear momentum $\\mathbf{P}$ is:\n$$ \\mathbf{P} = \\sum_{i=1}^N m_i \\mathbf{v}_i = \\mathbf{0} $$\nThis is a vector equation, which implies three scalar constraints on the velocity components of the particles:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^N m_i v_{ix} = 0 $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^N m_i v_{iy} = 0 $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^N m_i v_{iz} = 0 $$\nEach of these linear constraints removes one degree of freedom from the system. Therefore, the total number of independent translational degrees of freedom, $N_{dof, \\text{trans}}$, is not $3N$, but rather:\n$$ N_{dof, \\text{trans}} = 3N - 3 $$\n\nNext, we consider the rotational degrees of freedom. The system contains $M$ linear rigid bodies and $N-M$ non-linear rigid bodies.\nFor a linear rigid body in $3$-dimensional space, the rotational kinetic energy can be described by rotations about two principal axes perpendicular to the molecular axis. The moment of inertia about the molecular axis itself is taken to be zero for a classical linear rigid body, so rotation about this axis carries no kinetic energy. Thus, each of the $M$ linear molecules contributes $2$ rotational degrees of freedom. The total from this group is:\n$$ N_{dof, \\text{rot, linear}} = 2M $$\nFor a non-linear rigid body in $3$-dimensional space, the moments of inertia about all three principal axes are non-zero. Therefore, it has $3$ rotational degrees of freedom. The system contains $N-M$ such molecules. The total from this group is:\n$$ N_{dof, \\text{rot, non-linear}} = 3(N - M) $$\nThe total number of rotational degrees of freedom, $N_{dof, \\text{rot}}$, is the sum of the contributions from both types of molecules:\n$$ N_{dof, \\text{rot}} = 2M + 3(N - M) = 2M + 3N - 3M = 3N - M $$\nThere are no constraints specified for the total angular momentum, so all these rotational degrees of freedom are independent and contribute to the kinetic energy.\n\nThe total number of effective quadratic degrees of freedom for the entire system, $N_{dof}$, is the sum of the translational and rotational degrees of freedom:\n$$ N_{dof} = N_{dof, \\text{trans}} + N_{dof, \\text{rot}} $$\n$$ N_{dof} = (3N - 3) + (3N - M) = 6N - M - 3 $$\n\nFinally, we apply the equipartition principle to find the target kinetic energy, $\\langle K \\rangle$. With $N_{dof} = 6N - M - 3$ quadratic degrees of freedom, each contributing an average energy of $\\frac{1}{2} k_B T$, the total average kinetic energy is:\n$$ \\langle K \\rangle = N_{dof} \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2} k_B T\\right) = (6N - M - 3) \\frac{1}{2} k_B T $$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the target kinetic energy required by the thermostat.",

The conservative internal forces do no net work on the total mechanical energy. The power transferred *to* the subsystem is thus $\\frac{dE_{\\text{sys}}}{dt}$.\n\nThe problem defines $P(T)$ as the power transferred *from* the subsystem *to* the thermostat. Therefore, based on the sign convention, this is the negative of the rate of change of the subsystem's energy:\n$$\nP(T) = -\\frac{dE_{\\text{sys}}}{dt} = -\\left( \\frac{dK}{dt} + \\frac{dU}{dt} \\right)\n$$\nWe shall now calculate the time derivatives of the kinetic and potential energies.\n\nFirst, we find the time derivative of the kinetic energy, $K(t)$, using the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{dK}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{p_i^2}{2 m_i} \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{1}{2 m_i} (2 p_i \\dot{p}_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{p_i \\dot{p}_i}{m_i}\n$$\nWe substitute the given equation of motion for the momenta, $\\dot{p}_i = F_i - \\xi p_i$:\n$$\n\\frac{dK}{dt} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{p_i}{m_i} (F_i - \\xi p_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{p_i F_i}{m_i} - \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{\\xi p_i^2}{m_i}\n$$\nThe second term can be rewritten by factoring out the thermostat variable $\\xi$ and recognizing the relationship to the kinetic energy $K(t)$:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{\\xi p_i^2}{m_i} = \\xi \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{p_i^2}{m_i} = \\xi \\left( 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{p_i^2}{2 m_i} \\right) = 2 \\xi K(t)\n$$\nThus, the rate of change of kinetic energy is:\n$$\n\\frac{dK}{dt} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{p_i F_i}{m_i} - 2 \\xi K(t)\n$$\n\nNext, we find the time derivative of the potential energy, $U(t)$, which depends on the particle positions $q_i(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dU}{dt} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial q_i} \\dot{q}_i\n$$\nUsing the provided relations $F_i = -\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial q_i}$ and $\\dot{q}_i = \\frac{p_i}{m_i}$, we substitute them into the expression for $\\frac{dU}{dt}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dU}{dt} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (-F_i) \\left( \\frac{p_i}{m_i} \\right) = - \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{F_i p_i}{m_i}\n$$\nThis term represents the rate of work done by the conservative internal forces, which converts kinetic energy into potential energy.\n\nNow, we can compute the total rate of change of the subsystem's energy, $\\frac{dE_{\\text{sys}}}{dt}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dE_{\\text{sys}}}{dt} = \\frac{dK}{dt} + \\frac{dU}{dt} = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{p_i F_i}{m_i} - 2 \\xi K(t) \\right) + \\left( - \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{F_i p_i}{m_i} \\right)\n$$\nThe terms involving the conservative forces $F_i$ cancel each other out, as expected. This cancellation reflects the fact that conservative forces only transfer energy between kinetic and potential forms within the system and do not change the total mechanical energy.\n$$\n\\frac{dE_{\\text{sys}}}{dt} = -2 \\xi K(t)\n$$\nThis expression shows that the rate of change of the subsystem's mechanical energy is solely due to the non-conservative thermostatting force.\n\nThe problem asks for the power $P(T)$ transferred *from* the subsystem to the thermostat, which is $P(T) = -\\frac{dE_{\\text{sys}}}{dt}$.\n$$\nP(T) = -(-2 \\xi K(t)) = 2 \\xi K(t)\n$$\nTo express this power in terms of the instantaneous temperature $T(t)$, we use the provided equipartition relation:\n$$\nK(t) = \\frac{g}{2} k_B T(t)\n$$\nwhere $g$ is the number of degrees of freedom and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.

Second, we linearize the Nosé-Hoover equations of motion to find the characteristic frequency of energy exchange, $\\omega_{Q}$.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Variance of Kinetic Energy, $\\mathrm{Var}(K)$\n\nWe begin from the principles of the canonical ensemble. For a classical system with $f$ independent quadratic degrees of freedom, the total kinetic energy is given by $K = \\sum_{j=1}^{f} \\epsilon_j$, where each $\\epsilon_j$ is the kinetic energy associated with one degree of freedom (e.g., $\\frac{p_x^2}{2m}$).\n\nIn the canonical ensemble at temperature $T$, the probability distribution of momentum for a single degree of freedom is given by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, which is a Gaussian distribution. The corresponding kinetic energy $\\epsilon$ for that degree of freedom has a probability distribution that can be derived from it. This distribution is a Gamma distribution, $\\Gamma(k, \\theta)$, with shape parameter $k = 1/2$ and scale parameter $\\theta = k_B T$. The probability density function for $\\epsilon$ is:\n$$\nP(\\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1/2)(k_B T)^{1/2}} \\epsilon^{1/2 - 1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\epsilon}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\Gamma(1/2) = \\sqrt{\\pi}$.\n\nThe total kinetic energy $K$ is the sum of $f$ such independent and identically distributed random variables. A key property of the Gamma distribution is that the sum of independent Gamma-distributed variables with the same scale parameter $\\theta$ is also a Gamma-distributed variable. The new shape parameter is the sum of the individual shape parameters. Therefore, $K$ follows a Gamma distribution with shape parameter $k_K = \\sum_{j=1}^{f} (1/2) = f/2$ and scale parameter $\\theta_K = k_B T$. The probability density function for $K$ is:\n$$\nP(K) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(f/2)(k_B T)^{f/2}} K^{f/2 - 1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{K}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nFor a Gamma distribution $\\Gamma(k, \\theta)$, the mean is $\\langle X \\rangle = k\\theta$ and the variance is $\\mathrm{Var}(X) = k\\theta^2$. Applying this to the distribution of $K$, we find the mean kinetic energy:\n$$\n\\langle K \\rangle = k_K \\theta_K = \\left(\\frac{f}{2}\\right)(k_B T) = \\frac{f}{2}k_B T\n$$\nThis result is the well-known equipartition theorem.

For the $\\dot{(\\delta K)}$ equation, we linearize by neglecting second-order terms in the fluctuations, i.e., the term $-2(\\delta\\xi)(\\delta K)$. The problem also states to treat the reversible virial term $\\sum_{i} v_{i}F_{i}$ as a fast fluctuating term that can be neglected when analyzing the slow dynamics of the thermostat.

By comparison, the square of the characteristic angular frequency is:\n$$\n\\omega_{Q}^2 = \\frac{2f k_B T}{Q}\n$$\nTherefore, the characteristic angular frequency is:\n$$\n\\omega_{Q} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2f k_B T}{Q}}\n$$\nThe parameter $Q$, often called the thermostat \"mass,\" controls the timescale of energy exchange. A large value of $Q$ results in a small $\\omega_{Q}$ and a long period of oscillation, meaning the energy exchange between the system and the thermostat is slow. The thermostat is \"heavy\" and does not closely follow rapid fluctuations in the system's kinetic energy. Conversely, a small $Q$ leads to a large $\\omega_{Q}$ and a fast response, tightly coupling the system to the thermostat. In a multiscale simulation, $Q$ is chosen to set the thermostat's response timescale $\\tau_Q \\sim 1/\\omega_Q$ to be slower than the fastest physical motions in the system but faster than the timescale of the phenomena under investigation, effectively filtering the kinetic energy fluctuations at a desired frequency.\n\nCombining the two results into the requested matrix form provides the final answer.",
