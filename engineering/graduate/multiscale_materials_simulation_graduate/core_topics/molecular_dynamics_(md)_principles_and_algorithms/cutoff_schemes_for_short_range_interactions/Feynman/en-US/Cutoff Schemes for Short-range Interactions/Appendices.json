While computationally efficient, this introduces a systematic error in physical observables like the potential energy. This practice guides you through a first-principles derivation to quantify this \"tail\" error and understand how it scales with the cutoff distance for a general potential, before applying it to the ubiquitous Lennard-Jones model .",

It contains no invalidating flaws. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe total potential energy $U$ of a system of $N$ particles in a volume $\\mathcal{V}$ described by a pair potential $V(r)$ can be expressed in terms of the number density $\\rho = N/\\mathcal{V}$ and the pair correlation function $g(r)$. For a homogeneous and isotropic fluid, the potential energy per particle, $u = U/N$, is given by:\n$$\nu = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho \\int_0^{\\infty} V(r) g(r) 4 \\pi r^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}r = 2 \\pi \\rho \\int_0^{\\infty} V(r) g(r) r^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}r\n$$\nThe factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$ corrects for the double counting of pairs. When the potential is truncated at a cutoff radius $r_c$, an error $\\Delta u$ is introduced, which corresponds to the contribution from the tail of the integral for $r \\ge r_c$.\n$$\n\\Delta u = 2 \\pi \\rho \\int_{r_c}^{\\infty} V(r) g(r) r^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}r\n$$\n\n**Part 1: General Bound and Scaling**\n\nWe are asked to find a bound on the magnitude of the truncation error, $|\\Delta u|$. Using the triangle inequality for integrals:\n$$\n|\\Delta u| = \\left| 2 \\pi \\rho \\int_{r_c}^{\\infty} V(r) g(r) r^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}r \\right| \\le 2 \\pi \\rho \\int_{r_c}^{\\infty} |V(r)| |g(r)| r^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}r\n$$\nThe problem states that for large separations, the pair correlations are bounded by a finite value $g_{\\infty} \\ge 0$. We assume $r_c$ is large enough so that $|g(r)| \\le g_{\\infty}$ for all $r \\ge r_c$. The problem also states that there exist constants $A  0$, $p  3$, and $r_0  0$ such that $|V(r)| \\le A r^{-p}$ for all $r \\ge r_0$. We assume $r_c \\ge r_0$. Applying these bounds:\n$$\n|\\Delta u| \\le 2 \\pi \\rho g_{\\infty} \\int_{r_c}^{\\infty} (A r^{-p}) r^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}r = 2 \\pi \\rho g_{\\infty} A \\int_{r_c}^{\\infty} r^{2-p} \\,\\mathrm{d}r\n$$\nThe integral can be evaluated directly. Since $p  3$, the exponent $2-p$ is less than $-1$, ensuring convergence.\n$$\n\\int_{r_c}^{\\infty} r^{2-p} \\,\\mathrm{d}r = \\left[ \\frac{r^{3-p}}{3-p} \\right]_{r_c}^{\\infty}\n$$\nBecause $p  3$, the exponent $3-p$ is negative, so $\\lim_{r\\to\\infty} r^{3-p} = 0$. The integral evaluates to:\n$$\n0 - \\frac{r_c^{3-p}}{3-p} = \\frac{r_c^{3-p}}{p-3}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the inequality gives the bound on $|\\Delta u|$:\n$$\n|\\Delta u| \\le \\frac{2 \\pi \\rho g_{\\infty} A}{p-3} r_c^{3-p}\n$$\nThis shows that the bound on the magnitude of the truncation error scales with the cutoff radius as $|\\Delta u| \\propto r_c^{3-p}$.\n\n**Part 2: Lennard-Jones Potential**\n\nNow we consider the specific case of the Lennard-Jones potential:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r) = 4 \\epsilon \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^{12} - \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^{6} \\right]\n$$\nThe truncation error is:\n$$\n\\Delta u = 2 \\pi \\rho \\int_{r_c}^{\\infty} V_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r) g(r) r^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}r\n$$\nThe problem specifies using the \"standard large-distance tail approximation\" for $g(r)$ in the limit $r_c/\\sigma \\to \\infty$.

We must compare the two terms. The first term scales as $(r_c/\\sigma)^{-9}$, while the second term scales as $(r_c/\\sigma)^{-3}$. As $r_c/\\sigma \\to \\infty$, the term with the smaller negative power, $(r_c/\\sigma)^{-3}$, decays much more slowly and is therefore the dominant, leading-order term.

The boundary conditions for $S_{\\mathrm{cub}}(r)$ are $S(r_{s})=1$, $S(r_{c})=0$, $S'(r_{s})=0$, and $S'(r_{c})=0$. In terms of $g_{\\mathrm{cub}}(x)$, these conditions are:\n$1.$ $g_{\\mathrm{cub}}(0) = 1$\n$2.$ $g_{\\mathrm{cub}}(1) = 0$\n$3.$ $g'_{\\mathrm{cub}}(0) = 0$ (since $S'(r_s) = g'_{\\mathrm{cub}}(0)/w = 0$)\n$4.$ $g'_{\\mathrm{cub}}(1) = 0$ (since $S'(r_c) = g'_{\\mathrm{cub}}(1)/w = 0$)\n\nApplying these conditions to $g_{\\mathrm{cub}}(x)$ and its derivative $g'_{\\mathrm{cub}}(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c$:\nFrom condition $1$: $g_{\\mathrm{cub}}(0) = d = 1$.\nFrom condition $3$: $g'_{\\mathrm{cub}}(0) = c = 0$.\nThe polynomial simplifies to $g_{\\mathrm{cub}}(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + 1$.\nApplying the remaining conditions:\nFrom condition $2$: $g_{\\mathrm{cub}}(1) = a + b + 1 = 0$.\nFrom condition $4$: $g'_{\\mathrm{cub}}(1) = 3a + 2b = 0$.\n\nWe solve the system of two linear equations for $a$ and $b$:\n$$a + b = -1$$\n$$3a + 2b = 0$$\nFrom the second equation, $b = -\\frac{3}{2}a$.

The six boundary conditions for $S_{\\mathrm{qui}}(r)$ are $S(r_{s})=1$, $S(r_{c})=0$, $S'(r_{s})=0$, $S'(r_{c})=0$, $S''(r_{s})=0$, and $S''(r_{c})=0$.

The bound is:\n$$|\\Delta f(r)| \\le |S'(r)||\\phi(r)| + (1 - S(r))|\\phi'(r)|$$\n\n**4. Comparison of the Supremum of $|S'(r)|$**\n\nThe problem asks for a comparison of the $|S'(r)||\\phi(r)|$ term, which requires finding the supremum of $|S'(r)|$ for both functions over the interval $[r_{s}, r_{c}]$.\n\nFor the cubic function:\n$S'_{\\mathrm{cub}}(r) = \\frac{1}{w} g'_{\\mathrm{cub}}(x) = \\frac{1}{w}(6x^2 - 6x) = \\frac{6}{w}x(x-1)$.\nSince $x \\in [0, 1]$, the term $x(x-1)$ is non-positive.\n$|S'_{\\mathrm{cub}}(r)| = \\frac{6}{w}|x(x-1)| = \\frac{6}{w}(x - x^2)$.\nTo find the maximum of this expression on $[0,1]$, we find the vertex of the parabola $p(x) = x - x^2$. The maximum occurs at $x = -1/(2(-1)) = 1/2$.\nThe maximum value of $|g'_{\\mathrm{cub}}(x)| = 6(x-x^2)$ is at $x=1/2$:\n$|g'_{\\mathrm{cub}}(1/2)| = 6(\\frac{1}{2} - (\\frac{1}{2})^2) = 6(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}) = 6(\\frac{1}{4}) = \\frac{3}{2}$.\nTherefore, $\\sup_{r \\in [r_{s}, r_{c}]} |S'_{\\mathrm{cub}}(r)| = \\frac{1}{w} \\sup_{x \\in [0, 1]} |g'_{\\mathrm{cub}}(x)| = \\frac{3}{2w}$.\n\nFor the quintic function:\n$S'_{\\mathrm{qui}}(r) = \\frac{1}{w} g'_{\\mathrm{qui}}(x) = \\frac{1}{w}(-30x^4 + 60x^3 - 30x^2) = -\\frac{30}{w}x^2(x^2 - 2x + 1) = -\\frac{30}{w}x^2(x-1)^2$.\nThe term $x^2(x-1)^2$ is non-negative for all $x$. Thus, $S'_{\\mathrm{qui}}(r)$ is non-positive on the interval.\n$|S'_{\\mathrm{qui}}(r)| = \\frac{30}{w}x^2(x-1)^2 = \\frac{30}{w}[x(1-x)]^2$.\nThe maximum of this expression occurs where $x(1-x)$ is maximum, which is at $x=1/2$. At this point, $x(1-x) = 1/4$.\nThe maximum value of $|g'_{\\mathrm{qui}}(x)| = 30[x(1-x)]^2$ is at $x=1/2$:\n$|g'_{\\mathrm{qui}}(1/2)| = 30[(\\frac{1}{2})(1-\\frac{1}{2})]^2 = 30(\\frac{1}{4})^2 = \\frac{30}{16} = \\frac{15}{8}$.\nTherefore, $\\sup_{r \\in [r_{s}, r_{c}]} |S'_{\\mathrm{qui}}(r)| = \\frac{1}{w} \\sup_{x \\in [0, 1]} |g'_{\\mathrm{qui}}(x)| = \\frac{15}{8w}$.\n\n**5. Final Ratio Calculation**\n\nThe required ratio is:\n$$\\frac{\\sup_{r \\in [r_{s}, r_{c}]} |S_{\\mathrm{cub}}'(r)|}{\\sup_{r \\in [r_{s}, r_{c}]} |S_{\\mathrm{qui}}'(r)|} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2w}}{\\frac{15}{8w}} = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{8}{15} = \\frac{24}{30} = \\frac{4}{5}$$\nThe ratio is a dimensionless constant, indicating that for a given switching width $w$, the maximum magnitude of the derivative of the cubic switching function is $4/5$ that of the quintic switching function. This is counter-intuitive as higher-order smoothing is generally expected to reduce derivatives, but here we see the opposite for the first derivative's peak magnitude. The quintic function's additional constraints force its slope to be steeper in the middle of the interval to satisfy the zero-derivative conditions at both ends.",
