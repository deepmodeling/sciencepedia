A solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution is developed in two parts as requested.\n\nFirst, we derive the scaling of the ratio of gradient energy density to classical energy density. The classical strain energy density, let's denote it $W_{classical}$, is a function of the strain tensor $\\varepsilon$. For a linear elastic isotropic material, it takes the form $W_{classical} = \\frac{1}{2} \\lambda (\\mathrm{tr}(\\varepsilon))^2 + \\mu \\mathrm{tr}(\\varepsilon^2)$, where $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$ are the Lamé parameters. For scaling purposes, we can state that the energy density scales with the square of a characteristic strain magnitude, $|\\varepsilon|$, multiplied by a characteristic elastic modulus, which we can denote by a generic stiffness constant $C$.\n$$\nW_{classical} \\sim C |\\varepsilon|^2\n$$\nThe physical units of energy density are energy per volume, or force per area (stress), which is consistent with the units of $C$ (stress) since strain $|\\varepsilon|$ is dimensionless.\n\nNext, we consider the strain gradient energy density, $W_{gradient}$. This term is introduced to account for size effects and depends on the gradient of the strain tensor, $\\nabla \\varepsilon$. The problem states that a material length scale is introduced to ensure $W_{gradient}$ has the same physical units as $W_{classical}$. The units of strain gradient are inverse length, since $[\\nabla \\varepsilon] = [\\varepsilon]/[\\text{Length}] = 1/[\\text{Length}]$. To construct an energy density term, we must combine $|\\nabla \\varepsilon|$ with material parameters to obtain units of stress. A common formulation for the gradient energy term involves the square of the strain gradient magnitude, $|\\nabla \\varepsilon|^2$, which has units of $1/[\\text{Length}]^2$. To give this term units of stress, it must be multiplied by a factor with units of [Stress] $\\times$ [Length]$^2$. This factor is typically constructed from a material stiffness, say $C'$, and the square of an intrinsic material length scale, which we will denote as $l_m$. This length scale represents the influence of the underlying microstructure.\n$$\nW_{gradient} \\sim C' l_m^2 |\\nabla \\varepsilon|^2\n$$\nIt is physically sound to assume that the intrinsic length scale $l_m$ is related to the characteristic dimension of the microstructure, which in this problem is the average grain size $\\ell$. We therefore make the assumption that $l_m \\sim \\ell$. Furthermore, for scaling analysis, we can assume the higher-order stiffness $C'$ is of the same order of magnitude as the classical stiffness $C$. With these assumptions, the scaling for the gradient energy density becomes:\n$$\nW_{gradient} \\sim C \\ell^2 |\\nabla \\varepsilon|^2\n$$\nNow, we can find the ratio of the gradient energy density to the classical energy density:\n$$\n\\frac{W_{gradient}}{W_{classical}} \\sim \\frac{C \\ell^2 |\\nabla \\varepsilon|^2}{C |\\varepsilon|^2} = \\ell^2 \\left(\\frac{|\\nabla \\varepsilon|}{|\\varepsilon|}\\right)^2\n$$\nThe problem provides a key assumption for smooth loading conditions over the structural dimension $L$: the characteristic strain gradient magnitude is related to the characteristic strain magnitude by $|\\nabla \\varepsilon| \\sim |\\varepsilon|/L$. Substituting this into our ratio gives the desired scaling in terms of $\\ell$ and $L$:\n$$\n\\frac{W_{gradient}}{W_{classical}} \\sim \\ell^2 \\left(\\frac{|\\varepsilon|/L}{|\\varepsilon|}\\right)^2 = \\ell^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{L}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\ell}{L}\\right)^2\n$$\nThis derivation shows that the relative importance of gradient energy terms scales as the square of the ratio of the microstructural length scale to the macroscopic structural length scale.\n\nSecond, we compute the ratio $L/\\ell$ using the given values and assess the significance of strain gradient effects.\nThe given values are $\\ell = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and $L = 10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. First, we convert them to a consistent unit, for instance, meters ($m$).\n$$\n\\ell = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 10 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\n$$\nL = 10\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 10 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe ratio $L/\\ell$ is then:\n$$\n\\frac{L}{\\ell} = \\frac{10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m}}{10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}} = 10^{(-2 - (-5))} = 10^3 = 1000\n$$\nThe ratio $L/\\ell = 1000$ is much greater than $1$, which satisfies the condition for the RVE assumption ($L/\\ell \\gg 1$). This indicates that, for many purposes, a classical local constitutive model would be sufficient.\n\nTo assess the significance of strain gradient effects, we use the scaling derived previously:\n$$\n\\frac{W_{gradient}}{W_{classical}} \\sim \\left(\\frac{\\ell}{L}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{1000}\\right)^2 = (10^{-3})^2 = 10^{-6}\n$$\nThis result indicates that the energy contribution from strain gradients is approximately one-millionth of the contribution from the classical strain energy. Based on this, we can argue that strain gradient effects are expected to be entirely negligible for this component under the stated assumption of a smooth strain field (i.e., smooth loading without significant strain localization). If the loading were to induce sharp features like shear bands or plasticity near a crack tip, the local strain gradients could become very large, and the assumption $|\\nabla \\varepsilon| \\sim |\\varepsilon|/L$ would break down, potentially making gradient effects locally significant. However, for the case of smooth fields, their contribution is insignificant.\n\nThe question asks to report $L/\\ell$ as the final answer.\n$$\n\\frac{L}{\\ell} = 1000\n$$",

The governing equation is:\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{F}}_{p} = \\mathbf{L}_{p}\\mathbf{F}_{p}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the plastic velocity gradient, $\\mathbf{L}_{p}$, we obtain a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for $\\mathbf{F}_{p}(t)$:\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{F}}_{p}(t) = \\left( \\dot{\\gamma}(t)\\,\\mathbf{s}\\otimes\\mathbf{m} \\right) \\mathbf{F}_{p}(t)\n$$\nLet us define the Schmid tensor $\\mathbf{N} = \\mathbf{s}\\otimes\\mathbf{m}$. Since the slip system orientation, defined by the vectors $\\mathbf{s}$ and $\\mathbf{m}$, is constant in the specimen frame, the tensor $\\mathbf{N}$ is also constant with respect to time. The differential equation becomes:\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{F}}_{p}(t) = \\dot{\\gamma}(t)\\mathbf{N}\\mathbf{F}_{p}(t)\n$$\nThis is a linear ODE with a time-dependent coefficient $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$. The solution can be found by direct integration. For an equation of the form $\\dot{\\mathbf{X}} = f(t)\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{X}$ with constant matrix $\\mathbf{A}$, the solution is $\\mathbf{X}(t) = \\exp\\left(\\mathbf{A}\\int_{0}^{t}f(t')\\,dt'\\right)\\mathbf{X}(0)$.

For a static problem, this implies the equality of work densities: $\\langle \\sigma \\varepsilon \\rangle = \\Sigma E$. The residual $r$ quantifies the extent to which the given microscopic fields violate this condition.\n\nTo compute $r$, we must first compute the two terms: $\\Sigma E$ and $\\langle \\sigma \\varepsilon \\rangle$.\n\n**1. Compute the macroscopic stress $\\Sigma$ and the macroscopic work density $\\Sigma E$.**\n\nThe macroscopic stress $\\Sigma$ is defined as the volume average of the microscopic stress $\\sigma(x)$:\n$$\n\\Sigma = \\langle \\sigma(x) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} \\sigma(x) \\,dx\n$$\nSubstituting the given expression for $\\sigma(x)$:\n$$\n\\Sigma = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} \\left[ \\Sigma_{0} + c \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) + d \\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\right] dx\n$$\nWe evaluate the integral term by term:\n$$\n\\Sigma = \\frac{1}{L} \\left[ \\int_{0}^{L} \\Sigma_{0} \\,dx + c \\int_{0}^{L} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\,dx + d \\int_{0}^{L} \\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\,dx \\right]\n$$\nThe integrals of the sinusoidal functions over their periods are zero:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\,dx = \\left[ -\\frac{L}{2\\pi} \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{L} = -\\frac{L}{2\\pi}(\\cos(2\\pi) - \\cos(0)) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L} \\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\,dx = \\left[ \\frac{L}{4\\pi} \\sin\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{L} = \\frac{L}{4\\pi}(\\sin(4\\pi) - \\sin(0)) = 0\n$$\nTherefore, the expression for $\\Sigma$ simplifies to:\n$$\n\\Sigma = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} \\Sigma_{0} \\,dx = \\frac{1}{L} (\\Sigma_{0} L) = \\Sigma_{0}\n$$\nThe macroscopic work density is then:\n$$\n\\Sigma E = \\Sigma_{0} E\n$$\n\n**2. Compute the volume-averaged microscopic work density $\\langle \\sigma(x)\\,\\varepsilon(x) \\rangle$.**\n\nThis quantity is defined as:\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma \\varepsilon \\rangle = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} \\sigma(x) \\varepsilon(x) \\,dx\n$$\nSubstitute the expressions for $\\sigma(x)$ and $\\varepsilon(x)$:\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma \\varepsilon \\rangle = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} \\left[ \\Sigma_{0} + c \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) + d \\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\right] \\left[ E + a \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) + b \\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\right] dx\n$$\nThe calculation is simplified by noting the orthogonality of the basis functions $\\{1, \\sin(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}), \\cos(\\frac{4\\pi x}{L})\\}$. The average of the product of any two distinct basis functions over the interval $[0, L]$ is zero. We need the following standard integral results:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{L} \\int_0^L \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi k x}{L}\\right) dx = \\frac{1}{2} \\quad \\text{for integer } k \\ge 1\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{L} \\int_0^L \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi k x}{L}\\right) dx = \\frac{1}{2} \\quad \\text{for integer } k \\ge 1\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{L} \\int_0^L \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi n x}{L}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi m x}{L}\\right) dx = 0 \\quad \\text{for integers } n, m \\ge 1\n$$\nWhen expanding the product $\\sigma(x)\\varepsilon(x)$, only terms whose spatial functions are identical (or constant) will have a non-zero average. The non-zero terms in the average are:\n1. The product of the constant terms: $\\langle \\Sigma_{0} E \\rangle = \\Sigma_{0} E$.\n2. The product of the $\\sin(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L})$ terms: $\\langle ca \\sin^2(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}) \\rangle = ca \\langle \\sin^2(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}) \\rangle = \\frac{ac}{2}$.\n3. The product of the $\\cos(\\frac{4\\pi x}{L})$ terms: $\\langle db \\cos^2(\\frac{4\\pi x}{L}) \\rangle = db \\langle \\cos^2(\\frac{4\\pi x}{L}) \\rangle = \\frac{bd}{2}$.\n\nAll other cross-product terms, such as $\\Sigma_0 a \\sin(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L})$ or $cb \\sin(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L})\\cos(\\frac{4\\pi x}{L})$, will average to zero.\nSumming the non-zero contributions:\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma \\varepsilon \\rangle = \\Sigma_{0} E + \\frac{ac}{2} + \\frac{bd}{2} = \\Sigma_{0} E + \\frac{ac+bd}{2}\n$$\n\n**3. Compute the residual $r$.**\n\nNow we can compute the residual $r$:\n$$\nr = \\langle \\sigma \\varepsilon \\rangle - \\Sigma E\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions we derived:\n$$\nr = \\left( \\Sigma_{0} E + \\frac{ac+bd}{2} \\right) - (\\Sigma_{0} E)\n$$\n$$\nr = \\frac{ac+bd}{2}\n$$\n\n**4.
