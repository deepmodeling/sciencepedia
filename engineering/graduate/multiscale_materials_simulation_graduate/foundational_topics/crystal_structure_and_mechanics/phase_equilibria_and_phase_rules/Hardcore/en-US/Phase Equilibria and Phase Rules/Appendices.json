The context of CALPHAD and phase-field modeling is a mainstream, well-established methodology in computational materials science.

It requests a derivation from first principles, followed by an application to a specific, well-defined case ($C=3$, $P=1,2,3$), and an interpretation of the results. All necessary conditions (fixed $T$ and $p$, non-reacting system) are provided, leading to a unique and meaningful solution.\n- **Objective**: The language is technical, precise, and devoid of subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Phase Rule at Fixed T and p**\n\nThe state of a single phase is described by its temperature $T$, pressure $p$, and the chemical potentials $\\mu_i$ of its $C$ components. These variables are not all independent. For any phase, they are related by the Gibbs–Duhem equation:\n$$S dT - V dp + \\sum_{i=1}^{C} n_i d\\mu_i = 0$$\nwhere $S$, $V$, and $n_i$ are the entropy, volume, and number of moles of component $i$ in that phase, respectively. Dividing by the total number of moles in the phase, $N = \\sum_i n_i$, we obtain the relation in terms of molar quantities and mole fractions, $x_i = n_i/N$:\n$$s dT - v dp + \\sum_{i=1}^{C} x_i d\\mu_i = 0$$\nThe problem specifies that the system is held at a fixed temperature $T$ and fixed pressure $p$. Therefore, any variations in the state of the system must occur with $dT=0$ and $dp=0$. Under these constraints, the Gibbs-Duhem equation for a single phase simplifies to:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{C} x_i d\\mu_i = 0$$\nNow, consider a system with $C$ components coexisting in $P$ distinct phases at equilibrium. A fundamental condition for multiphase equilibrium is that the chemical potential of each component $i$, $\\mu_i$, must be uniform throughout the system. That is, for each component $i \\in \\{1, 2, ..., C\\}$:\n$$\\mu_i^{(1)} = \\mu_i^{(2)} = \\dots = \\mu_i^{(P)}$$\nwhere the superscript $(\\alpha)$ denotes the phase, $\\alpha \\in \\{1, 2, ..., P\\}$. Because the chemical potential for each component is the same across all phases, we can drop the phase superscript and refer simply to $\\mu_1, \\mu_2, \\dots, \\mu_C$.\n\nFor this system of $P$ phases, there is a Gibbs-Duhem relation for each phase. Applying the fixed $T$ and $p$ condition, we obtain a set of $P$ simultaneous linear equations for the differentials of the chemical potentials, $\\{d\\mu_1, d\\mu_2, \\dots, d\\mu_C\\}$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx_1^{(1)} d\\mu_1 + x_2^{(1)} d\\mu_2 + \\dots + x_C^{(1)} d\\mu_C = 0 \\\\\nx_1^{(2)} d\\mu_1 + x_2^{(2)} d\\mu_2 + \\dots + x_C^{(2)} d\\mu_C = 0 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nx_1^{(P)} d\\mu_1 + x_2^{(P)} d\\mu_2 + \\dots + x_C^{(P)} d\\mu_C = 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe number of thermodynamic degrees of freedom, $F$, is the number of intensive variables that can be independently varied without changing the number of phases in equilibrium. At fixed $T$ and $p$, these variables are the compositions. The number of independent variations of composition is equal to the number of ways we can independently vary the set of chemical potentials, $\\{d\\mu_1, \\dots, d\\mu_C\\}$, while satisfying the $P$ equilibrium constraints imposed by the Gibbs-Duhem relations.\n\nThere are $C$ variables in this system ($d\\mu_1, \\dots, d\\mu_C$). The number of independent linear equations (constraints) is given by the rank of the $P \\times C$ coefficient matrix of mole fractions, $[x_i^{(\\alpha)}]$. Assuming the $P$ phases have distinct compositions that are not linearly dependent (a condition for distinct phases), the rank of this matrix is $P$. Thus, there are $P$ independent constraints on the $C$ variables.\n\nThe number of degrees of freedom $F$ is the total number of variables minus the number of independent constraints:\n$$F = C - P$$\nThis is the condensed phase rule, also known as the Gibbs phase rule for an isothermal, isobaric system. It is important to note that $F$ cannot be negative, which implies that the number of coexisting phases $P$ cannot exceed the number of components $C$ under these conditions.\n\n**Application to the Ternary Alloy System**\n\nFor the specified ternary alloy, the number of components is $C=3$. The expression for the degrees of freedom becomes:\n$$F = 3 - P$$\n\nWe can now compute $F$ for different numbers of coexisting phases $P$:\n1.  **Single-phase region ($P=1$)**:\n    $$F = 3 - 1 = 2$$\n2.  **Two-phase region ($P=2$)**:\n    $$F = 3 - 2 = 1$$\n3.  **Three-phase region ($P=3$)**:\n    $$F = 3 - 3 = 0$$\n\n**Geometric Interpretation and Implications for Simulation**\n\nThe composition space for a ternary system at fixed $T$ and $p$ is represented by an equilateral triangle known as the Gibbs composition triangle. The vertices represent the pure components A, B, and C.\n\n-   For $P=1$, $F=2$. A system with two degrees of freedom corresponds to an **area** in the composition triangle. Within a single-phase field (e.g., liquid, or a solid solution like FCC), we can independently vary two composition variables (e.g., the mole fractions of A and B, which then determines the mole fraction of C since they must sum to $1$) while remaining in that single-phase state.\n\n-   For $P=2$, $F=1$. A system with one degree of freedom corresponds to a **line** or **curve**. In a two-phase region, the compositions of the two phases in equilibrium are not independent. They are fixed at the endpoints of a **tie-line**. The overall composition of the alloy can lie anywhere on this tie-line, but the compositions of the coexisting phases themselves are constrained. As we vary the one available degree of freedom (e.g., by changing the composition of one phase along its boundary curve, the solvus or solidus), the composition of the other phase also changes in a determined way, sweeping out another boundary curve, and the tie-line moves with them.\n\n-   For $P=3$, $F=0$. A system with zero degrees of freedom is called invariant (at fixed $T, p$). This corresponds to a **point** or, more accurately, a set of three specific points. When three phases coexist in equilibrium, their compositions are all fixed and unchangeable. These three compositions form the vertices of a **tie-triangle** on the Gibbs triangle. Any overall alloy composition falling inside this triangle will decompose into these three phases with these exact compositions.\n\nIn the context of a CALPHAD-informed phase-field simulation at fixed $T$ and $p$, these constraints are critical. The CALPHAD database provides the Gibbs free energy functions for each phase, from which the equilibrium phase diagram (including tie-lines and tie-triangles) is computed. This information is passed to the phase-field model to enforce local thermodynamic equilibrium at interfaces.\n-   When simulating a two-phase microstructure, the model must ensure that the compositions on either side of a moving interface always correspond to the endpoints of a valid tie-line for the given temperature. The problem is reduced to finding which tie-line is selected by the kinetics of diffusion.\n-   When simulating a three-phase microstructure, any triple junction where three phases meet must have compositions pinned to the three fixed vertex compositions of the corresponding tie-triangle.\nTherefore, the phase rule, as calculated from the CALPHAD database, provides the fundamental thermodynamic constraints on the composition fields, ensuring the physical realism of the simulation.",

Let $f_{\\gamma}$ be the mole fraction of the $\\gamma$ phase and $f_{\\beta}$ be the mole fraction of the $\\beta$ phase in the bulk alloy. The fundamental principle governing the system is the conservation of moles for the total system and for each individual component.\n\nThe conservation of total moles requires that the sum of the phase fractions equals unity:\n$$f_{\\gamma} + f_{\\beta} = 1$$\n\nThe conservation of moles for each component $i \\in \\{\\mathrm{Ni}, \\mathrm{Co}, \\mathrm{Al}\\}$ is expressed by the lever rule, which states that the overall bulk composition is the weighted average of the compositions of the individual phases:\n$$x_{i}^{\\mathrm{bulk}} = f_{\\gamma} x_{i}^{\\gamma} + f_{\\beta} x_{i}^{\\beta}$$\n\nWe can solve for the phase fractions using the data for any one of the components. We have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, $f_{\\gamma}$ and $f_{\\beta}$.

We have used the $\\mathrm{Ni}$ data to find the phase fractions, so we will now use the $\\mathrm{Co}$ and $\\mathrm{Al}$ data to verify this result.\n\nVerification using Cobalt ($\\mathrm{Co}$) data:\nWe check if $x_{\\mathrm{Co}}^{\\mathrm{bulk}} = f_{\\gamma} x_{\\mathrm{Co}}^{\\gamma} + f_{\\beta} x_{\\mathrm{Co}}^{\\beta}$.\nThe given data are $x_{\\mathrm{Co}}^{\\mathrm{bulk}}=0.16$, $x_{\\mathrm{Co}}^{\\gamma}=0.20$, and $x_{\\mathrm{Co}}^{\\beta}=0.10$.\n$$f_{\\gamma} x_{\\mathrm{Co}}^{\\gamma} + f_{\\beta} x_{\\mathrm{Co}}^{\\beta} = (0.60)(0.20) + (0.40)(0.10) = 0.12 + 0.04 = 0.16$$\nThis matches the bulk composition $x_{\\mathrm{Co}}^{\\mathrm{bulk}}=0.16$.

The balance for Aluminum is also satisfied. The consistency of the results across all three components validates the calculation.\n\nFinally, we consider the Gibbs phase rule, which relates the number of degrees of freedom ($F$) to the number of components ($C$), the number of phases ($P$), and the number of non-compositional intensive variables ($N$, typically temperature and pressure). The rule is:\n$$F = C - P + N$$\nFor this system, we have $C=3$ components ($\\mathrm{Ni}$, $\\mathrm{Co}$, $\\mathrm{Al}$), $P=2$ phases ($\\gamma$, $\\beta$), and $N=2$ variables (temperature $T$ and pressure $P$).\n$$F = 3 - 2 + 2 = 3$$\nThe system has $3$ degrees of freedom. This means that three intensive variables can be independently changed while maintaining the two-phase equilibrium. The problem specifies that temperature and pressure are fixed ($T=1200\\,\\mathrm{K}$ and $P=1\\,\\mathrm{bar}$). By fixing two degrees of freedom, the number of remaining degrees of freedom is reduced to $F' = 3 - 2 = 1$.\n\nIn a ternary system at constant $T$ and $P$, this single degree of freedom corresponds to the ability to vary the compositions of the equilibrium phases along a continuous set of tie-lines that span the two-phase region on the Gibbs triangle. However, the problem provides the specific compositions of the $\\gamma$ and $\\beta$ phases for a single, fixed tie-line. This implies that this last degree of freedom has also been constrained, for instance, by specifying the composition of one component in one of the phases.\nTherefore, for the given fixed tie-line at constant $T$ and $P$, the system has zero remaining degrees of freedom ($F''=0$). This means all intensive properties of the individual phases are fixed.\n\nIn this context:\n- The **fixed variables** are the temperature ($T$), the pressure ($P$), and consequently the compositions of the equilibrium phases ($x_{\\mathrm{Ni}}^{\\gamma}$, $x_{\\mathrm{Co}}^{\\gamma}$, $x_{\\mathrm{Al}}^{\\gamma}$, and $x_{\\mathrm{Ni}}^{\\beta}$, $x_{\\mathrm{Co}}^{\\beta}$, $x_{\\mathrm{Al}}^{\\beta}$).\n- The variables that **adjust** are the mole fractions of the phases, $f_{\\gamma}$ and $f_{\\beta}$. These fractions are not intensive properties of the equilibrium phases themselves but describe the overall state of the bulk mixture. Their values are determined by the position of the overall bulk composition ($x_{i}^{\\mathrm{bulk}}$) along the fixed tie-line, according to the lever rule.\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n$f_{\\gamma} = 0.6000$\n$f_{\\beta} = 0.4000$",

Since the number of lattice sites is conserved, this also equals the molar phase fraction $f_\\alpha$ *if the impurity concentration is uniform* ($x_I^\\alpha = x_I^\\beta = x_I^0$). Here, it's not uniform, which introduces a correction.\n\nLet's proceed by substituting all numerical values into the equation for $f_{\\alpha}$ and solving.\n$a = (K - 1)(c_{A}^{\\alpha, \\mathrm{host}} - c_{A}^{\\beta, \\mathrm{host}}) = (4 - 1)(0.20 - 0.80) = 3(-0.60) = -1.80$\nFor the other coefficients, it is algebraically intensive. A different but equivalent approach is to rearrange the A-balance equation:\n$x_{A}^{0} = f_{\\alpha} c_{A}^{\\alpha, \\mathrm{host}} - f_{\\alpha} c_{A}^{\\alpha, \\mathrm{host}} x_{I}^{\\alpha} + (1-f_{\\alpha})c_{A}^{\\beta, \\mathrm{host}} - (1-f_{\\alpha})c_{A}^{\\beta, \\mathrm{host}}x_{I}^{\\beta}$\n$x_{A}^{0} - c_{A}^{\\beta, \\mathrm{host}} = f_{\\alpha}(c_{A}^{\\alpha, \\mathrm{host}} - c_{A}^{\\beta, \\mathrm{host}}) - f_{\\alpha} c_{A}^{\\alpha, \\mathrm{host}} x_{I}^{\\alpha} + (f_{\\alpha}-1) c_{A}^{\\beta, \\mathrm{host}} x_{I}^{\\beta}$\nSubstitute expressions for $x_I^\\alpha$ and $x_I^\\beta$:\n$x_{A}^{0} - c_{A}^{\\beta, \\mathrm{host}} = f_{\\alpha}(c_{A}^{\\alpha, \\mathrm{host}} - c_{A}^{\\beta, \\mathrm{host}}) - \\frac{x_I^0}{1+f_{\\alpha}(K-1)} [ f_{\\alpha}c_{A}^{\\alpha, \\mathrm{host}} K + (1-f_{\\alpha})c_{A}^{\\beta, \\mathrm{host}} ]$\nThis becomes a quadratic equation. Using the given values:\n$c_{A}^{\\alpha, \\mathrm{host}} = 0.20$, $c_{A}^{\\beta, \\mathrm{host}} = 0.80$, $x_{A}^{0} = 0.50$, $x_{I}^{0} = 0.01$, $K=4$.\nThe equation is $1.80 f_{\\alpha}^2 - 0.30 f_{\\alpha} - 0.292 = 0$.\n\nWe solve this equation for $f_{\\alpha}$ using the quadratic formula, $f_{\\alpha} = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$f_{\\alpha} = \\frac{-(-0.30) \\pm \\sqrt{(-0.30)^2 - 4(1.80)(-0.292)}}{2(1.80)}$\n$f_{\\alpha} = \\frac{0.30 \\pm \\sqrt{0.09 + 2.1024}}{3.6}$\n$f_{\\alpha} = \\frac{0.30 \\pm \\sqrt{2.1924}}{3.6}$\n$f_{\\alpha} = \\frac{0.30 \\pm 1.48067552...}{3.6}$\n\nThis yields two possible mathematical solutions:\n$f_{\\alpha,1} = \\frac{0.30 + 1.48067552}{3.6} = \\frac{1.78067552}{3.6} \\approx 0.494632088...$\n$f_{\\alpha,2} = \\frac{0.30 - 1.48067552}{3.6} = \\frac{-1.18067552}{3.6}  0$\n\nSince the phase fraction $f_{\\alpha}$ must be a physical quantity, it must lie in the range $0 \\leq f_{\\alpha} \\leq 1$. Therefore, the only valid solution is $f_{\\alpha,1}$.\nRounding the result to six significant figures as requested:\n$f_{\\alpha} \\approx 0.494632$",
