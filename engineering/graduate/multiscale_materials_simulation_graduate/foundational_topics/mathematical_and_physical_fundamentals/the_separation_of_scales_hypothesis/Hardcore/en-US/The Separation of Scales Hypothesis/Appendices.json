            "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The problem describes one-dimensional Fickian diffusion in a medium with periodically varying microscopic diffusivity. This is a classic problem in homogenization theory, a well-established subfield of applied mathematics and physics. The method of two-scale asymptotic expansion is the standard technique for this class of problems. The given information is complete and self-consistent, with clear definitions of all variables, functions, and the small parameter $\\epsilon$. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three main parts: nondimensionalization, application of the two-scale asymptotic expansion, and derivation of the homogenized equation and the effective diffusivity.\n\n**Part 1: Nondimensionalization**\nThe governing partial differential equation (PDE) is:\n$$\n\\partial_t u(x,t) - \\partial_x \\left( D(x/l) \\, \\partial_x u(x,t) \\right) = 0\n$$\nThe givens are the macroscopic length scale $L$, the microscopic length scale $l$, and the diffusivity $D(x/l) = D_0 \\, d(x/l)$. We introduce dimensionless variables $\\hat{x}$ and $\\hat{t}$ such that $x = L\\hat{x}$ and $t=T\\hat{t}$, where $T$ is a characteristic time scale. The derivatives transform as:\n$$\n\\partial_t = \\frac{\\partial \\hat{t}}{\\partial t} \\partial_{\\hat{t}} = \\frac{1}{T} \\partial_{\\hat{t}}\n$$\n$$\n\\partial_x = \\frac{\\partial \\hat{x}}{\\partial x} \\partial_{\\hat{x}} = \\frac{1}{L} \\partial_{\\hat{x}}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the PDE gives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T} \\partial_{\\hat{t}} u - \\frac{1}{L} \\partial_{\\hat{x}} \\left( D_0 \\, d\\left(\\frac{L\\hat{x}}{l}\\right) \\frac{1}{L} \\partial_{\\hat{x}} u \\right) = 0\n$$\nLet $\\epsilon = l/L$ be the dimensionless scale-separation parameter. The argument of the function $d$ becomes $L\\hat{x}/l = \\hat{x}/\\epsilon$. The equation can be rearranged to:\n$$\n\\partial_{\\hat{t}} u = \\frac{T D_0}{L^2} \\partial_{\\hat{x}} \\left( d(\\hat{x}/\\epsilon) \\, \\partial_{\\hat{x}} u \\right)\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the diffusive time scale $T$ is chosen to remove explicit prefactors. This requires setting the coefficient group to unity:\n$$\n\\frac{T D_0}{L^2} = 1 \\implies T = \\frac{L^2}{D_0}\n$$\nThis is the characteristic time for diffusion over the macroscopic length scale $L$. Letting $u^{\\epsilon}(\\hat{x},\\hat{t})$ denote the solution in these dimensionless variables, the nondimensional PDE is:\n$$\n\\partial_{\\hat{t}} u^{\\epsilon} - \\partial_{\\hat{x}} \\left( d(\\hat{x}/\\epsilon) \\, \\partial_{\\hat{x}} u^{\\epsilon} \\right) = 0\n$$\nFor notational clarity, we hereafter drop the hats and the superscript $\\epsilon$, writing the nondimensional variables as $x$ and $t$.\n\n**Part 2: Two-Scale Asymptotic Expansion**\nWe seek a solution in the form of a formal two-scale expansion in powers of $\\epsilon \\ll 1$:\n$$\nu(x,t) = u_0(x,t) + \\epsilon u_1(x,t,y) + \\epsilon^2 u_2(x,t,y) + \\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^3)\n$$\nwhere $y=x/\\epsilon$ is the fast variable capturing the microscopic oscillations. The functions $u_i(x,t,y)$ for $i \\ge 1$ are assumed to be $1$-periodic in $y$. The leading term $u_0$ is assumed to be independent of the fast scale $y$. The spatial derivative operator must be transformed using the chain rule, treating $x$ and $y$ as independent variables:\n$$\n\\partial_x \\rightarrow \\partial_x + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\partial_y\n$$\nSubstituting the expansion and the transformed derivative into the nondimensional PDE gives:\n$$\n\\partial_t \\left( u_0 + \\epsilon u_1 + \\dots \\right) - \\left( \\partial_x + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\partial_y \\right) \\left[ d(y) \\left( \\partial_x + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\partial_y \\right) \\left( u_0 + \\epsilon u_1 + \\dots \\right) \\right] = 0\n$$\nWe expand the differential operator and collect terms based on powers of $\\epsilon$.\n$$\n\\partial_t u_0 + \\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon) - \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2}\\mathcal{L}_{yy} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\mathcal{L}_{xy} + \\mathcal{L}_{xx} \\right] (u_0 + \\epsilon u_1 + \\dots) = 0\n$$\nwhere the operators are defined as:\n$\\mathcal{L}_{yy} = \\partial_y (d(y) \\partial_y)$\n$\\mathcal{L}_{xy} = \\partial_y (d(y) \\partial_x) + \\partial_x (d(y) \\partial_y)$\n$\\mathcal{L}_{xx} = \\partial_x (d(y) \\partial_x)$\n\nFor the asymptotic expansion to be valid, the collection of terms at each order of $\\epsilon$ must vanish independently. The terms that \"vanish in the limit $\\epsilon \\to 0$\" are precisely those that constitute the equations at each order in the asymptotic hierarchy. The most singular terms (with negative powers of $\\epsilon$) must be set to zero first.\n\nOrder $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2})$:\nThe leading-order term in the expansion is $\\mathcal{L}_{yy} u_0 = \\partial_y(d(y)\\partial_y u_0)$. This term vanishes identically because $u_0(x,t)$ is independent of the fast variable $y$, so $\\partial_y u_0 = 0$.\n\nOrder $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-1})$:\nThe terms at this order must sum to zero: $\\mathcal{L}_{yy} u_1 + \\mathcal{L}_{xy} u_0 = 0$.\nLet's evaluate the operators:\n$\\mathcal{L}_{yy} u_1 = \\partial_y(d(y)\\partial_y u_1)$.\n$\\mathcal{L}_{xy} u_0 = \\partial_y(d(y)\\partial_x u_0) + \\partial_x(d(y)\\partial_y u_0) = \\partial_y(d(y)\\partial_x u_0)$ since $\\partial_y u_0=0$.\nBecause $\\partial_x u_0$ is independent of $y$, this simplifies to $(\\partial_y d(y)) \\partial_x u_0$.\nThe equation is $\\partial_y(d(y)\\partial_y u_1) + (\\partial_y d(y))\\partial_x u_0 = 0$. This can be written as:\n$$\n\\partial_y \\left( d(y)\\partial_y u_1 + d(y)\\partial_x u_0 \\right) = 0\n$$\nIntegrating this equation with respect to $y$ gives:\n$$\nd(y)\\partial_y u_1 + d(y)\\partial_x u_0 = C_1(x,t)\n$$\nwhere $C_1(x,t)$ is an integration \"constant\" with respect to $y$. To determine $C_1$, we impose the condition that $u_1$ must be periodic in $y$. We rearrange for $\\partial_y u_1$:\n$$\n\\partial_y u_1 = \\frac{C_1(x,t)}{d(y)} - \\partial_x u_0\n$$\nFor $u_1$ to be periodic in $y$, the integral of $\\partial_y u_1$ over one period must be zero. Let $\\langle f \\rangle = \\int_0^1 f(y)dy$ denote the average over a unit cell in $y$.\n$$\n\\langle \\partial_y u_1 \\rangle = \\int_0^1 \\left(\\frac{C_1}{d(y)} - \\partial_x u_0\\right) dy = 0\n$$\n$C_1 \\langle d^{-1} \\rangle - \\partial_x u_0 = 0 \\implies C_1(x,t) = \\frac{\\partial_x u_0}{\\langle d^{-1} \\rangle}$.\nThis relates $C_1$ to the macroscopic gradient of $u_0$.\n\n**Part 3: Derivation of the Homogenized Equation**\nWe now proceed to the $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^0)$ equation:\n$$\n\\partial_t u_0 - \\left( \\mathcal{L}_{yy} u_2 + \\mathcal{L}_{xy} u_1 + \\mathcal{L}_{xx} u_0 \\right) = 0\n$$\nThis equation involves the unknown second-order correction $u_2$. To obtain a closed equation for $u_0$, we apply a solvability condition, which consists of averaging the entire equation over one period of the fast variable $y$.\n$$\n\\langle \\partial_t u_0 \\rangle - \\langle \\mathcal{L}_{yy} u_2 \\rangle - \\langle \\mathcal{L}_{xy} u_1 \\rangle - \\langle \\mathcal{L}_{xx} u_0 \\rangle = 0\n$$\nWe evaluate the average of each term:\n1. $\\langle \\partial_t u_0 \\rangle = \\partial_t u_0$, since $u_0$ is independent of $y$.\n2. $\\langle \\mathcal{L}_{yy} u_2 \\rangle = \\langle \\partial_y(d(y)\\partial_y u_2) \\rangle = \\int_0^1 \\partial_y(d(y)\\partial_y u_2) dy = [d(y)\\partial_y u_2]_0^1 = 0$. This vanishes due to the periodicity of $d(y)$ and $u_2(y)$. This is the crucial step that eliminates the unknown $u_2$.\n3. $\\langle \\mathcal{L}_{xy} u_1 \\rangle = \\langle \\partial_y(d\\partial_x u_1) + \\partial_x(d\\partial_y u_1) \\rangle = \\langle \\partial_y(d\\partial_x u_1) \\rangle + \\langle \\partial_x(d\\partial_y u_1) \\rangle$. The first part vanishes, $\\langle \\partial_y(d\\partial_x u_1) \\rangle = 0$, by periodicity. The second part becomes $\\partial_x \\langle d\\partial_y u_1 \\rangle$.\n4. $\\langle \\mathcal{L}_{xx} u_0 \\rangle = \\langle \\partial_x(d\\partial_x u_0) \\rangle = \\partial_x \\langle d\\partial_x u_0 \\rangle = \\partial_x (\\langle d \\rangle \\partial_x u_0)$.\n\nCombining these results, the averaged equation for $u_0$ is:\n$$\n\\partial_t u_0 - \\partial_x \\langle d\\partial_y u_1 \\rangle - \\partial_x (\\langle d \\rangle \\partial_x u_0) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\partial_t u_0 - \\partial_x \\left( \\langle d\\partial_y u_1 + d\\partial_x u_0 \\rangle \\right) = 0\n$$\nWe recognize the term inside the average, $d(y)\\partial_y u_1 + d(y)\\partial_x u_0$, as the quantity we previously found to be equal to $C_1(x,t)$.\n$$\n\\partial_t u_0 - \\partial_x \\langle C_1(x,t) \\rangle = 0\n$$\nSince $C_1(x,t)$ does not depend on $y$, its average is just itself: $\\langle C_1(x,t) \\rangle = C_1(x,t)$.\n$$\n\\partial_t u_0 - \\partial_x (C_1(x,t)) = 0\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_1$:\n$$\n\\partial_t u_0 - \\partial_x \\left( \\frac{\\partial_x u_0}{\\langle d^{-1} \\rangle} \\right) = 0\n$$\nSince $\\langle d^{-1} \\rangle = \\int_0^1 1/d(y) dy$ is a constant, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\partial_t u_0 - \\frac{1}{\\langle d^{-1} \\rangle} \\partial_x^2 u_0 = 0\n$$\nThis is the homogenized macroscopic diffusion equation for the leading-order concentration field $u_0(x,t)$. It has the standard form of a diffusion equation with a constant effective diffusion coefficient. By comparing this to the general form $\\partial_t u_0 - d_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\partial_x^2 u_0 = 0$, we identify the effective nondimensional diffusion coefficient $d_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n\nThe effective coefficient is the harmonic average of the microscopic diffusivity profile:\n$$\nd_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{1}{\\langle d(y)^{-1} \\rangle} = \\frac{1}{\\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{d(y)} dy}\n$$\nThis result is physically intuitive for a one-dimensional series system, where conductances (diffusivities) combine via their reciprocals (resistances).",

It represents a standard, non-trivial calculation in the field.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe variance of the effective modulus estimator, $\\widehat{E}_{R}$, is defined as:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\widehat{E}_{R}) = \\operatorname{Var}\\left( \\frac{1}{V_{d}(R)} \\int_{V} E(\\mathbf{x}) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $V$ is the RVE domain, a $d$-ball of radius $R$. Using the properties of the variance operator, this becomes:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\widehat{E}_{R}) = \\frac{1}{V_{d}(R)^2} \\operatorname{Var}\\left( \\int_{V} E(\\mathbf{x}) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x} \\right) = \\frac{1}{V_{d}(R)^2} \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\left( \\int_{V} (E(\\mathbf{x})-\\mu) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x} \\right)^2 \\right]\n$$\nThis can be written as a double integral of the covariance function:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\widehat{E}_{R}) = \\frac{1}{V_{d}(R)^2} \\int_{V} \\int_{V} \\operatorname{Cov}(E(\\mathbf{x}), E(\\mathbf{y})) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{y}\n$$\nSubstituting the given covariance function $C(|\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{y}|)$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\widehat{E}_{R}) = \\frac{1}{V_{d}(R)^2} \\int_{V} \\int_{V} C(|\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{y}|) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{y}\n$$\nThe problem requires an asymptotic expression for this variance in the limit $R \\gg \\ell_{c}$. In this limit, the domain size $R$ is much larger than the correlation length $\\ell_{c}$ of the random field. The covariance function $C(|\\mathbf{z}|)$ decays to zero rapidly for $|\\mathbf{z}| > \\ell_{c}$. This implies that the double integral is dominated by contributions where $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$ are close to each other.\nThe double integral can be simplified as follows. We introduce a change of variables $\\mathbf{z} = \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{y}$. The integral becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{V} \\int_{V} C(|\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{y}|) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{y} = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^d} C(|\\mathbf{z}|) \\left( \\int_{V \\cap (V+\\mathbf{z})} \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x} \\right) \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{z}\n$$\nThe inner integral is the volume of the intersection of the domain $V$ with a translated version of itself, which is a function of the translation vector $\\mathbf{z}$. Since $C(|\\mathbf{z}|)$ is negligible for $|\\mathbf{z}| \\gg \\ell_{c}$ and we are in the regime $R \\gg \\ell_{c}$, the intersection volume for relevant values of $\\mathbf{z}$ is approximately the full volume of the domain, $V_d(R)$.

Let $\\rho = |\\mathbf{z}|$. The volume element is $\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{z} = \\rho^{d-1} \\mathrm{d}\\rho \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega_{d-1}$, where $\\mathrm{d}\\Omega_{d-1}$ is the solid angle element. The integral over the solid angle yields the surface area of the unit $(d-1)$-sphere, $S_{d-1} = \\frac{2\\pi^{d/2}}{\\Gamma(d/2)}$.\n$$\nI_C = \\sigma^2 \\int_{S_{d-1}} \\mathrm{d}\\Omega_{d-1} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\rho}{\\ell_c}\\right) \\rho^{d-1} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\rho = \\sigma^2 S_{d-1} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\rho^{d-1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\rho}{\\ell_c}\\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\rho\n$$\nThe remaining radial integral can be evaluated using a substitution $u = \\rho/\\ell_c$, so $\\rho = u\\ell_c$ and $\\mathrm{d}\\rho = \\ell_c \\mathrm{d}u$.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} (u\\ell_c)^{d-1} \\exp(-u) \\, (\\ell_c \\mathrm{d}u) = \\ell_c^d \\int_{0}^{\\infty} u^{d-1} \\exp(-u) \\, \\mathrm{d}u = \\ell_c^d \\Gamma(d)\n$$\nwhere $\\Gamma(d)$ is the Gamma function.\nThus, the integral of the covariance is:\n$$\nI_C = \\sigma^2 S_{d-1} \\ell_c^d \\Gamma(d)\n$$\nThe volume of a $d$-ball of radius $R$ is $V_d(R) = \\frac{\\pi^{d/2} R^d}{\\Gamma(d/2+1)}$. We can also relate the volume to the surface area of the unit sphere: $V_d(R) = \\frac{S_{d-1}}{d}R^d$.\nSubstituting these into the asymptotic variance expression:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\widehat{E}_{R}) \\approx \\frac{I_C}{V_d(R)} = \\frac{\\sigma^2 S_{d-1} \\ell_c^d \\Gamma(d)}{\\frac{S_{d-1}}{d}R^d} = \\sigma^2 d \\Gamma(d) \\left(\\frac{\\ell_c}{R}\\right)^d\n$$\nThis is the required asymptotic expression for the variance of the estimator.\n\nNext, we impose the tolerance constraint $\\operatorname{Var}(\\widehat{E}_{R}) \\le \\theta$:\n$$\n\\sigma^2 d \\Gamma(d) \\left(\\frac{\\ell_c}{R}\\right)^d \\le \\theta\n$$\nWe need to solve for the minimal size ratio $r = R/\\ell_c$.

It presents a standard, solvable problem in the field of mechanical metamaterials and wave physics. All required parameters are defined, and the tasks are clear and logically sequenced. The problem is valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested.\n\n**1. Equations of Motion and Dispersion Relation**\n\nWe begin by applying Newton's Second Law to the masses in the $n$-th unit cell. The displacement of the host mass $m_{h}$ in cell $n$ is $u_{n}(t)$, and the displacement of the resonator mass $m_{r}$ is $v_{n}(t)$.\n\nFor the host mass $m_{h}$ in cell $n$, the forces are:\n-   Force from the spring connecting to the host mass in cell $n-1$: $F_{n-1} = k_{h}(u_{n-1} - u_{n})$.\n-   Force from the spring connecting to the host mass in cell $n+1$: $F_{n+1} = k_{h}(u_{n+1} - u_{n})$.\n-   Force from the internal resonator spring: $F_{r} = k_{r}(v_{n} - u_{n})$.\n\nNewton's Second Law, $F=ma$, for the host mass $m_{h}$ is:\n$$m_{h} \\frac{d^{2}u_{n}}{dt^{2}} = k_{h}(u_{n+1} - u_{n}) + k_{h}(u_{n-1} - u_{n}) + k_{r}(v_{n} - u_{n})$$\n$$m_{h} \\ddot{u}_{n} = k_{h}(u_{n+1} + u_{n-1} - 2u_{n}) + k_{r}(v_{n} - u_{n})$$\n\nFor the resonator mass $m_{r}$ in cell $n$, the only force is from its connecting spring to the host mass $m_{h}$:\n-   Force from the host mass spring: $F_{h} = k_{r}(u_{n} - v_{n})$.\n\nNewton's Second Law for the resonator mass $m_{r}$ is:\n$$m_{r} \\frac{d^{2}v_{n}}{dt^{2}} = k_{r}(u_{n} - v_{n})$$\n$$m_{r} \\ddot{v}_{n} = k_{r}(u_{n} - v_{n})$$\n\nNext, we apply the Bloch-Floquet ansatz for traveling wave solutions in a periodic medium:\n$$u_{n}(t) = U\\exp\\!\\big(i(n a k - \\omega t)\\big)$$\n$$v_{n}(t) = V\\exp\\!\\big(i(n a k - \\omega t)\\big)$$\nwhere $U$ and $V$ are the complex amplitudes, $k$ is the Bloch wavenumber, and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency.\nThe second time derivatives are $\\ddot{u}_{n} = -\\omega^{2} u_{n}$ and $\\ddot{v}_{n} = -\\omega^{2} v_{n}$. The displacements in adjacent cells are related by $u_{n\\pm 1} = u_{n}\\exp(\\pm i a k)$.\n\nSubstituting these into the equations of motion and cancelling the common factor $\\exp\\!\\big(i(n a k - \\omega t)\\big)$:\nFor the host mass:\n$$-\\omega^{2} m_{h} U = k_{h}(U\\exp(i a k) + U\\exp(-i a k) - 2U) + k_{r}(V - U)$$\n$$-\\omega^{2} m_{h} U = k_{h}U(2\\cos(a k) - 2) + k_{r}(V - U)$$\nRearranging terms, we get the first algebraic equation:\n$$\\big(\\omega^{2} m_{h} - 2k_{h}(1 - \\cos(a k)) - k_{r}\\big)U + k_{r}V = 0$$\n\nFor the resonator mass:\n$$-\\omega^{2} m_{r} V = k_{r}(U - V)$$\nRearranging terms, we get the second algebraic equation:\n$$-k_{r}U + (k_{r} - \\omega^{2} m_{r})V = 0$$\n\nThese two homogeneous linear equations for $U$ and $V$ have a non-trivial solution if and only if the determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero:\n$$\n\\det\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\omega^{2} m_{h} - 2k_{h}(1 - \\cos(a k)) - k_{r} & k_{r} \\\\\n-k_{r} & k_{r} - \\omega^{2} m_{r}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= 0\n$$\nExpanding the determinant gives the dispersion relation:\n$$\\big(\\omega^{2} m_{h} - 2k_{h}(1 - \\cos(a k)) - k_{r}\\big)\\big(k_{r} - \\omega^{2} m_{r}\\big) - (k_{r})(-k_{r}) = 0$$\n$$\\big(\\omega^{2} m_{h} - k_{r} - 2k_{h}(1 - \\cos(a k))\\big)\\big(k_{r} - \\omega^{2} m_{r}\\big) + k_{r}^{2} = 0$$\n\n**2. Dynamic Effective Mass and Negative Mass Regime**\n\nTo find the dynamic effective mass $m_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega)$, we rearrange the dispersion relation into the form $\\omega^{2} m_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega)=2 k_{h}\\big(1-\\cos(k a)\\big)$.\nFrom the second algebraic equation, we can express the amplitude ratio $V/U$:\n$$V = \\frac{k_{r}}{k_{r} - \\omega^{2} m_{r}} U$$\nSubstitute this into the first algebraic equation:\n$$\\big(\\omega^{2} m_{h} - k_{r} - 2k_{h}(1 - \\cos(a k))\\big)U + k_{r}\\left(\\frac{k_{r}}{k_{r} - \\omega^{2} m_{r}}\\right)U = 0$$\nSince $U \\neq 0$ for a non-trivial solution, we can divide by $U$:\n$$\\omega^{2} m_{h} - k_{r} - 2k_{h}(1 - \\cos(a k)) + \\frac{k_{r}^{2}}{k_{r} - \\omega^{2} m_{r}} = 0$$\nIsolating the term with $k$:\n$$2k_{h}(1 - \\cos(a k)) = \\omega^{2} m_{h} - k_{r} + \\frac{k_{r}^{2}}{k_{r} - \\omega^{2} m_{r}}$$\n$$2k_{h}(1 - \\cos(a k)) = \\omega^{2} m_{h} + \\frac{-k_{r}(k_{r} - \\omega^{2} m_{r}) + k_{r}^{2}}{k_{r} - \\omega^{2} m_{r}}$$\n$$2k_{h}(1 - \\cos(a k)) = \\omega^{2} m_{h} + \\frac{-\\cancel{k_{r}^{2}} + \\omega^{2} m_{r}k_{r} + \\cancel{k_{r}^{2}}}{k_{r} - \\omega^{2} m_{r}}$$\n$$2k_{h}(1 - \\cos(a k)) = \\omega^{2} m_{h} + \\frac{\\omega^{2} m_{r}k_{r}}{k_{r} - \\omega^{2} m_{r}}$$\nWe are given the form $\\omega^{2} m_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega)=2 k_{h}\\big(1-\\cos(k a)\\big)$. By comparison,\n$$\\omega^{2} m_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega) = \\omega^{2} m_{h} + \\frac{\\omega^{2} m_{r}k_{r}}{k_{r} - \\omega^{2} m_{r}}$$\nFor $\\omega \\neq 0$, we can divide by $\\omega^2$ to find the dynamic effective mass:\n$$m_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega) = m_{h} + \\frac{m_{r}k_{r}}{k_{r} - \\omega^{2} m_{r}}$$\nThe effective mass is negative when $m_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega) < 0$:\n$$m_{h} + \\frac{m_{r}k_{r}}{k_{r} - \\omega^{2} m_{r}} < 0$$\n$$\\frac{m_{h}(k_{r} - \\omega^{2} m_{r}) + m_{r}k_{r}}{k_{r} - \\omega^{2} m_{r}} < 0$$\n$$\\frac{k_{r}(m_{h} + m_{r}) - \\omega^{2} m_{h} m_{r}}{k_{r} - \\omega^{2} m_{r}} < 0$$\nThis inequality holds if the numerator and denominator have opposite signs. Let's find the roots of the numerator and denominator with respect to $\\omega^{2}$.\nThe root of the denominator is $\\omega^{2} = k_{r}/m_{r}$. Let's call this $\\omega_{-}^{2}$.\nThe root of the numerator is $\\omega^{2} = k_{r}(m_{h} + m_{r})/(m_{h} m_{r})$. Let's call this $\\omega_{+}^{2}$.\nNote that $\\omega_{+}^{2} = \\frac{k_{r}}{m_{r}}(1 + \\frac{m_{r}}{m_{h}}) > \\frac{k_{r}}{m_{r}} = \\omega_{-}^{2}$ since all mass and stiffness values are positive.\nLet's analyze the sign of the fraction in different frequency intervals:\n-   For $\\omega^{2} < \\omega_{-}^{2}$: The numerator is positive and the denominator is positive, so $m_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega) > 0$.\n-   For $\\omega_{-}^{2} < \\omega^{2} < \\omega_{+}^{2}$: The numerator is positive and the denominator is negative, so $m_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega) < 0$. This is the desired interval.\n-   For $\\omega^{2} > \\omega_{+}^{2}$: The numerator is negative and the denominator is negative, so $m_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega) > 0$.\n\nThe frequency interval $(\\omega_{-}, \\omega_{+})$ where $m_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega)$ is negative is therefore given by:\n$$\\omega_{-} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{r}}{m_{r}}}$$\n$$\\omega_{+} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{r}(m_{h} + m_{r})}{m_{h} m_{r}}}$$\nThese frequencies are in radians per second.\n\n**3. Assessment of the Separation-of-Scales Hypothesis**\n\nThe separation-of-scales hypothesis, $a \\ll \\lambda(\\omega)$, is a condition for the validity of homogenization, where a discrete lattice is approximated by a continuous effective medium. The wavelength $\\lambda$ is related to the wavenumber $k$ by $\\lambda = 2\\pi/|k|$. The hypothesis is thus equivalent to $|ka| \\ll 2\\pi$. In practice, a more stringent condition, $|ka| \\ll 1$, is often used.\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio $a/\\lambda(\\omega)$ at the \"upper edge of the acoustic branch\". In Bloch-Floquet theory, the dispersion relation is periodic in $k$-space. We consider the first Brillouin zone, which for this one-dimensional lattice spans $k \\in [-\\pi/a, \\pi/a]$. The acoustic branch is the lowest-frequency branch of the dispersion relation $\\omega(k)$. It starts at $(\\omega, k) = (0, 0)$ and ends at the edge of the Brillouin zone. The \"upper edge\" of this branch corresponds to the point with the maximum wavenumber magnitude, $|k| = \\pi/a$.\n\nAt this edge, the wavenumber is $k = \\pi/a$.\nThe corresponding wavelength is:\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{2\\pi}{k} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\pi/a} = 2a$$\nThe ratio $a/\\lambda$ is therefore:\n$$\\frac{a}{\\lambda} = \\frac{a}{2a} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThis result is independent of the specific mass and stiffness parameters of the model.\n\nThe separation-of-scales hypothesis requires $a/\\lambda \\ll 1$. Our calculated value is $a/\\lambda = 1/2$, which is not much smaller than $1$. This demonstrates that at the upper edge of the acoustic branch, which lies just below the band gap, the wavelength is only twice the lattice constant. The discrete nature of the material is dominant, and any continuum model based on the separation-of-scales hypothesis is invalid for describing wave phenomena in this regime. This is a fundamental characteristic of wave physics in periodic media near Brillouin zone boundaries, where band gaps typically form.\n\nThe final answer is composed of the expressions for $\\omega_{-}$, $\\omega_{+}$, and the ratio $a/\\lambda$.\n$\\omega_{-} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{r}}{m_{r}}}$\n$\\omega_{+} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{r}(m_{h} + m_{r})}{m_{h} m_{r}}}$\n$a/\\lambda = 1/2$",
