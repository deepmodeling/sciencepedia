Let the generalized coordinate be the angle $\\theta$, measured from the bottom of the hoop.\n\nIn Hamiltonian mechanics, the time evolution of a system's state $(q_i, p_i)$ in phase space is governed by Hamilton's equations:\n$$\n\\dot{q_i} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_i}, \\quad \\dot{p_i} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q_i}\n$$\nThese equations define a vector field $\\mathbf{v} = (\\dot{q_1}, \\dots, \\dot{q_n}, \\dot{p_1}, \\dots, \\dot{p_n})$ that describes the flow of phase space points.

            "solution": "### Solution Derivation\nThe state of the system is described by a point $z(t)$ in a $6$-dimensional phase space. The coordinates of $z(t)$ are $z = (r_1, r_2, r_3, p_1, p_2, p_3)$. The time evolution of $z(t)$ is governed by the system of first-order ordinary differential equations $\\dot{z} = \\mathbf{v}(z, t)$, where $\\mathbf{v}(z, t)$ is the phase-space velocity vector field. This vector field is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}(z, t) = (\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}, \\dot{\\mathbf{p}}) = \\left( \\frac{\\mathbf{p}}{m}, \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{r}) - \\gamma(t)\\mathbf{p} \\right)\n$$\nAn infinitesimal volume element $\\delta V$ in phase space evolves in time. The rate of change of this volume element is related to the divergence of the phase-space velocity field. Specifically, the Jacobian determinant $J(t) = \\det(\\partial z(t) / \\partial z(0))$ of the flow map $\\Phi_t: z(0) \\mapsto z(t)$ satisfies Liouville's formula:\n$$\n\\frac{dJ(t)}{dt} = J(t) \\left( \\nabla_z \\cdot \\mathbf{v}(z(t), t) \\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\nabla_z \\cdot \\mathbf{v}$ is the divergence of the velocity field with respect to the phase-space coordinates $z$.\n\nWe must compute this divergence. Let the components of $\\mathbf{r}$ be $(r_1, r_2, r_3)$ and the components of $\\mathbf{p}$ be $(p_1, p_2, p_3)$. The phase-space coordinates are $(r_1, r_2, r_3, p_1, p_2, p_3)$. The components of the phase-space velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ are:\n$$\nv_{r_i} = \\frac{p_i}{m} \\quad \\text{for } i=1,2,3\n$$\n$$\nv_{p_i} = F_i(\\mathbf{r}) - \\gamma(t)p_i \\quad \\text{for } i=1,2,3\n$$\nThe divergence $\\nabla_z \\cdot \\mathbf{v}$ is the sum of the partial derivatives of each component of $\\mathbf{v}$ with respect to its corresponding coordinate:\n$$\n\\nabla_z \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left( \\frac{\\partial v_{r_i}}{\\partial r_i} + \\frac{\\partial v_{p_i}}{\\partial p_i} \\right)\n$$\nLet's compute the individual terms:\n1.  Derivatives with respect to position $\\mathbf{r}$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial v_{r_i}}{\\partial r_i} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r_i} \\left( \\frac{p_i}{m} \\right) = 0\n    $$\n    This is because $p_i$ and $r_i$ are independent coordinates in phase space.\n\n2.  Derivatives with respect to momentum $\\mathbf{p}$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial v_{p_i}}{\\partial p_i} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_i} \\left( F_i(\\mathbf{r}) - \\gamma(t)p_i \\right)\n    $$\n    Since $\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{r}) = -\\nabla U(\\mathbf{r})$ depends only on $\\mathbf{r}$, we have $\\frac{\\partial F_i(\\mathbf{r})}{\\partial p_i} = 0$. The remaining term is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_i} \\left( - \\gamma(t)p_i \\right) = -\\gamma(t)\n    $$\n    This holds for each component $i=1, 2, 3$.\n\nSumming all the contributions, we get the divergence:\n$$\n\\nabla_z \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left( 0 - \\gamma(t) \\right) = -3\\gamma(t)\n$$\nNotably, the divergence is a function of time $t$ only and is independent of the phase-space position $z$. This means that the fractional rate of volume change is uniform throughout the entire phase space.\n\nSubstituting this result into the evolution equation for $J(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dJ(t)}{dt} = J(t) \\left( -3\\gamma(t) \\right) = -3\\gamma(t) J(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear homogeneous differential equation. We can solve it by separation of variables:\n$$\n\\frac{dJ}{J} = -3\\gamma(t) dt\n$$\nWe integrate both sides from the initial time $t=0$ to an arbitrary final time $T$. The initial condition for the Jacobian is $J(0) = \\det(\\partial z(0) / \\partial z(0)) = \\det(I) = 1$, where $I$ is the $6 \\times 6$ identity matrix.\n$$\n\\int_{J(0)}^{J(T)} \\frac{dJ}{J} = \\int_{0}^{T} -3\\gamma(t) dt\n$$\n$$\n\\left[ \\ln|J| \\right]_{1}^{J(T)} = -3 \\int_{0}^{T} \\gamma(t) dt\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(J(T)) - \\ln(1) = -3 \\int_{0}^{T} \\gamma(t) dt\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(J(T)) = -3 \\int_{0}^{T} \\frac{\\gamma_{0}}{1+(t/\\tau)^{2}} dt\n$$\nNow we must evaluate the integral. Let $I_{int} = \\int_{0}^{T} \\frac{\\gamma_{0}}{1+(t/\\tau)^{2}} dt$.\nWe perform a change of variables. Let $u = t/\\tau$. Then $du = (1/\\tau) dt$, so $dt = \\tau du$. The limits of integration change from $t=0$ to $u=0$ and from $t=T$ to $u=T/\\tau$.\n$$\nI_{int} = \\int_{0}^{T/\\tau} \\frac{\\gamma_{0}}{1+u^2} (\\tau du) = \\gamma_{0}\\tau \\int_{0}^{T/\\tau} \\frac{1}{1+u^2} du\n$$\nThe integral of $\\frac{1}{1+u^2}$ is $\\arctan(u)$.\n$$\nI_{int} = \\gamma_{0}\\tau \\left[ \\arctan(u) \\right]_{0}^{T/\\tau} = \\gamma_{0}\\tau \\left( \\arctan\\left(\\frac{T}{\\tau}\\right) - \\arctan(0) \\right)\n$$\nSince $\\arctan(0) = 0$, the integral is:\n$$\nI_{int} = \\gamma_{0}\\tau \\arctan\\left(\\frac{T}{\\tau}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\ln(J(T))$:\n$$\n\\ln(J(T)) = -3 \\gamma_{0}\\tau \\arctan\\left(\\frac{T}{\\tau}\\right)\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the solution for $J(T)$:\n$$\nJ(T) = \\exp\\left(-3 \\gamma_{0}\\tau \\arctan\\left(\\frac{T}{\\tau}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the phase-space volume ratio $V(T)/V(0)$. The volume of a region $\\Omega$ in phase space at time $t$ is $V(t) = \\int_{\\Omega(t)} d^3\\mathbf{r} d^3\\mathbf{p}$. By changing variables to the initial configuration $\\Omega(0)$, the volume element transforms as $d^3\\mathbf{r} d^3\\mathbf{p} = J(t) d^3\\mathbf{r}_0 d^3\\mathbf{p}_0$. Because $J(t)$ is independent of the phase-space coordinate $z$, it can be taken out of the integral:\n$$\nV(T) = \\int_{\\Omega(0)} J(T) d^3\\mathbf{r}_0 d^3\\mathbf{p}_0 = J(T) \\int_{\\Omega(0)} d^3\\mathbf{r}_0 d^3\\mathbf{p}_0 = J(T) V(0)\n$$\nTherefore, the ratio is:\n$$\n\\frac{V(T)}{V(0)} = J(T) = \\exp\\left(-3 \\gamma_{0}\\tau \\arctan\\left(\\frac{T}{\\tau}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThis expression is the final answer. It is dimensionless, as expected for a volume ratio. The presence of the dissipative term $-\\gamma(t)\\mathbf{p}$ leads to the contraction of phase-space volume, as indicated by the negative sign in the exponent.",
