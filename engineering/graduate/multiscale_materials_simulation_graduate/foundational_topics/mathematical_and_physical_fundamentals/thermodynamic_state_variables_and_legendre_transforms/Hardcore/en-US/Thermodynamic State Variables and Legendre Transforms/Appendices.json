This exercise provides a clean, analytical sandbox to do just that, using a simple quadratic potential that is analogous to the energy of a linear spring. By explicitly calculating the transform of $f(x)=x^2/2$, you will directly see how information is transferred from a potential dependent on a variable $x$ (e.g., strain) to its dual potential dependent on the conjugate variable $p = df/dx$ (e.g., stress), laying the groundwork for switching between thermodynamic ensembles .",

Consider a one-dimensional coarse-grained energy function $f(x)$ for a linear elastic micro-element, where the control variable $x$ is a generalized strain-like state variable and its conjugate $p$ is a generalized stress-like variable. Assume $f(x)$ is strictly convex and differentiable, and specifically let $f(x)=\\frac{x^{2}}{2}$.\n\nUsing the core definition of the Legendre transform grounded in convex duality and the principle that conjugate variables are related by gradients of the potential, compute the complementary potential $g(p)$ obtained by transforming from the $x$-controlled ensemble to the $p$-controlled ensemble.

            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the Legendre transform of a given potential function and the verification of the reciprocal relationship between the conjugate variables. The problem is well-posed, scientifically sound, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nThe fundamental principles governing this problem are the definition of the Legendre transform and the relationship between conjugate thermodynamic variables. For a potential $f(x)$ that is a function of a state variable $x$, its conjugate variable $p$ is defined as the derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$.\n$$p = \\frac{df(x)}{dx}$$\nThe Legendre transform of $f(x)$ is a new potential, $g(p)$, which is a function of the conjugate variable $p$. It is defined as:\n$$g(p) = \\sup_{x} (px - f(x))$$\nFor a strictly convex and differentiable function $f(x)$, as specified in the problem, the supremum is achieved at the point where the derivative of the expression $(px - f(x))$ with respect to $x$ is zero.\n$$\\frac{d}{dx}(px - f(x)) = p - \\frac{df(x)}{dx} = 0$$\nThis condition simplifies to the definition of the conjugate variable, $p = \\frac{df}{dx}$. Therefore, to compute the transform, we first establish the relationship between $p$ and $x$, express $x$ as a function of $p$, and then substitute both into the expression for $g(p)$, which becomes $g(p) = px(p) - f(x(p))$.\n\nThe given potential is a one-dimensional coarse-grained energy function:\n$$f(x) = \\frac{x^2}{2}$$\nwhere $x$ is a generalized strain-like variable.\n\nFirst, we find the conjugate stress-like variable, $p$, by taking the derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$p = \\frac{df}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{x^2}{2}\\right) = x$$\nThis simple relationship, $p = x$, directly links the strain-like and stress-like variables for this linear elastic model. To express $g$ as a function of $p$, we need to express $x$ in terms of $p$. From the relationship above, we have:\n$$x = p$$\n\nNow, we substitute $x=p$ and the original function $f(x) = \\frac{x^2}{2}$ into the definition of the Legendre transform, $g(p) = px - f(x)$.\n$$g(p) = p(p) - f(p) = p^2 - \\frac{p^2}{2}$$\nSimplifying this expression gives the complementary potential $g(p)$:\n$$g(p) = \\frac{p^2}{2}$$\n\nThe second part of the task is to verify the reciprocal mapping. The Legendre transform is an involution, meaning that applying it a second time returns the original function. The relationship between the variables is also reciprocal. Just as $p$ is the gradient of $f$ with respect to $x$, $x$ must be the gradient of $g$ with respect to $p$.\n$$x = \\frac{dg(p)}{dp}$$\nWe can verify this using the expression for $g(p)$ that we just derived:\n$$x = \\frac{d}{dp}\\left(\\frac{p^2}{2}\\right) = p$$\nThis result, $x=p$, is identical to the relationship we derived from $p = \\frac{df}{dx}$. The reciprocal mapping is thus verified, confirming the internal consistency of the transformation. The transformation from the $x$-controlled ensemble with potential $f(x)$ to the $p$-controlled ensemble with potential $g(p)$ is self-consistent and yields the complementary potential $g(p) = \\frac{p^2}{2}$. This result is characteristic of quadratic potentials, which are self-dual under the Legendre transformation.",

This gives rise to a double-well potential, which is the characteristic feature of a system that undergoes phase separation.\n\n1) Determination of the spinodal compositions $\\phi_{\\mathrm{s}}^{\\pm}(T)$:\nThe spinodal curve encloses the region of local instability of the homogeneous state. A state is locally unstable if the free energy is a concave function of the order parameter, meaning any small fluctuation will lower the free energy and grow. The boundary of this region, the spinodal, is therefore defined by the condition that the second derivative of the free energy density with respect to the order parameter is zero. This corresponds to the loss of local convexity.\nThe stability criterion from the second variation of $f$ dictates that for a stable or metastable homogeneous state, $\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial \\phi^2} \\ge 0$.

For a non-convex free energy function $f(\\phi)$, the equilibrium state for an average composition lying between the two minima is a phase-separated mixture described by the convex hull of $f(\\phi)$. The convex hull is constructed via a common tangent to the free energy curve. The points of tangency, $\\phi_{\\mathrm{b}}^{-}$ and $\\phi_{\\mathrm{b}}^{+}$, are the binodal compositions.\n\nThe conditions for two compositions, say $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$, to be in equilibrium are that they share the same chemical potential and the same grand potential density:\n(i) $\\mu(\\phi_1) = \\mu(\\phi_2)$\n(ii) $f(\\phi_1) - \\mu(\\phi_1)\\phi_1 = f(\\phi_2) - \\mu(\\phi_2)\\phi_2$\n\nThe given free energy density $f(\\phi;T)$ is an even function of $\\phi$, since it only contains even powers of $\\phi$. That is, $f(\\phi;T) = f(-\\phi;T)$. This symmetry implies that the two coexisting phases must have opposite compositions: $\\phi_{\\mathrm{b}}^{-} = -\\phi_{\\mathrm{b}}^{+}$. Let us denote $\\phi_{\\mathrm{b}}^{+}$ simply as $\\phi_b$. Then $\\phi_{\\mathrm{b}}^{-} = -\\phi_b$.\n\nThe chemical potential $\\mu(\\phi) = a(T - T_c)\\phi + b\\phi^3$ is an odd function of $\\phi$, i.e., $\\mu(\\phi) = -\\mu(-\\phi)$.\nApplying the first equilibrium condition, $\\mu(\\phi_b) = \\mu(-\\phi_b)$:\n$$\n\\mu(\\phi_b) = -\\mu(\\phi_b) \\implies 2\\mu(\\phi_b) = 0 \\implies \\mu(\\phi_b) = 0\n$$\nThe common tangent for this symmetric potential must therefore have a slope of zero. The coexistence chemical potential is $\\mu_{coex} = 0$.\n\nWith $\\mu(\\phi_b) = \\mu(-\\phi_b) = 0$, the second equilibrium condition becomes $f(\\phi_b) = f(-\\phi_b)$, which is already satisfied due to the even symmetry of $f(\\phi)$. Thus, we only need to find the non-trivial roots of $\\mu(\\phi)=0$.\n$$\n\\mu(\\phi) = \\phi \\left( a(T - T_c) + b\\phi^2 \\right) = 0\n$$\nThis equation has three roots. One is the trivial root $\\phi=0$, which corresponds to the locally unstable (for $TT_c$) high-temperature symmetric phase. The other two roots are the binodal compositions, found by setting the term in the parenthesis to zero:\n$$\na(T - T_c) + b\\phi_{\\mathrm{b}}^2 = 0\n$$\nSolving for $\\phi_{\\mathrm{b}}^2$:\n$$\nb\\phi_{\\mathrm{b}}^2 = -a(T - T_c) = a(T_c - T)\n$$\n$$\n\\phi_{\\mathrm{b}}^2 = \\frac{a(T_c - T)}{b}\n$$\nThe two binodal compositions are therefore:\n$$\n\\phi_{\\mathrm{b}}^{\\pm}(T) = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{a(T_c - T)}{b}}\n$$\n\nJustification via Legendre Transform:\nThe Legendre transform of $f(\\phi;T)$ defines the thermodynamic potential $g(\\mu;T)$ whose natural variable is the chemical potential $\\mu$:\n$$\ng(\\mu;T) = \\sup_{\\phi} \\{ \\mu \\phi - f(\\phi;T) \\}\n$$\nThe supremum condition $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\phi}(\\mu \\phi - f) = 0$ yields $\\mu = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial\\phi}$, which is the definition of the chemical potential. Because $f(\\phi)$ is non-convex for $T  T_c$, its derivative $\\mu(\\phi)$ is non-monotonic. Inverting this relation to express $\\phi$ as a function of $\\mu$ results in a multi-valued function over a certain range of $\\mu$. This multi-valuedness signifies instability. The true, physically meaningful thermodynamic potential $g(\\mu)$ must be a single-valued, convex function. This is obtained by replacing the multi-valued part with a function corresponding to the common tangent on $f(\\phi)$, a procedure known as the Maxwell construction.\n\nThe boundary of the non-convex region of $f(\\phi)$ is where $\\partial^2 f/\\partial \\phi^2 = 0$, defining the spinodal points $\\phi_s^\\pm$. The range of $\\mu$ for which $\\phi(\\mu)$ is multi-valued is $[\\mu_{min}, \\mu_{max}]$, where the extrema correspond to the chemical potentials at the spinodal points. The binodal points $\\phi_b^\\pm$ are the specific compositions that coexist at a single chemical potential $\\mu_{coex}$. At this potential, the two phases have equal grand potential $g(\\mu_{coex})$. For the symmetric potential given, this occurs at $\\mu_{coex}=0$, and the binodal points are simply the non-zero solutions to $\\mu(\\phi)=0$. The Legendre transform naturally convexifies the potential, with the straight-line common-tangent segment in the $f(\\phi)$ plot mapping to a single point of coexistence in the $g(\\mu)$ plot, thereby eliminating the unstable region from the thermodynamic description in the $\\mu$ ensemble.\n\nIn summary, the four requested compositions are:\n$\\phi_{\\mathrm{b}}^{-}(T) = -\\sqrt{\\frac{a(T_c - T)}{b}}$\n$\\phi_{\\mathrm{b}}^{+}(T) = \\sqrt{\\frac{a(T_c - T)}{b}}$\n$\\phi_{\\mathrm{s}}^{-}(T) = -\\sqrt{\\frac{a(T_c - T)}{3b}}$\n$\\phi_{\\mathrm{s}}^{+}(T) = \\sqrt{\\frac{a(T_c - T)}{3b}}$",

Differential Form of Gibbs Free Energy and Phase Coexistence**\n\nThe fundamental thermodynamic relation for the internal energy $U$ as a function of its natural variables, entropy $S$, volume $V$, and number of particles $N$, is given by:\n$$dU = TdS - PdV + \\mu dN$$\nwhere $T$ is temperature, $P$ is pressure, and $\\mu$ is the chemical potential.\n\nThe Gibbs free energy $G$ is obtained from the internal energy $U$ via a double Legendre transform, which changes the natural variables from $(S,V,N)$ to $(T,P,N)$. The transformation is defined as:\n$$G(T,P,N) = U - TS + PV$$\nTo find the differential form of $G$, we take its total differential:\n$$dG = dU - d(TS) + d(PV)$$\nUsing the product rule for differentiation, $d(TS) = TdS + SdT$ and $d(PV) = PdV + VdP$.

For a system with two possible phases, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, the stable phase will be the one with the lower molar Gibbs free energy, $g \\equiv G/N$. Phase $\\alpha$ is stable if $g_{\\alpha}(T,P)  g_{\\beta}(T,P)$, and phase $\\beta$ is stable if $g_{\\beta}(T,P)  g_{\\alpha}(T,P)$. The two phases can coexist in equilibrium only when their molar Gibbs free energies are equal:\n$$g_{\\alpha}(T,P) = g_{\\beta}(T,P)$$\n\n**2. Stability Analysis near the Equilibrium Point**\n\nWe assess which phase is favored for small perturbations away from the equilibrium state $(T_0, P_0)$, where $g_{\\alpha}(T_0,P_0) = g_{\\beta}(T_0,P_0)$. For this analysis, we consider the change in the difference of molar Gibbs energies, $\\Delta g = g_{\\beta} - g_{\\alpha}$.

Since $s_{\\alpha} - s_{\\beta}  0$ and $dT  0$, we have $d(\\Delta g)  0$. This implies that $g_{\\beta}$ becomes greater than $g_{\\alpha}$.

Derivation and Evaluation of the Coexistence Line Slope**\n\nAlong the coexistence curve, the condition $g_{\\alpha}(T,P) = g_{\\beta}(T,P)$ must hold for all points $(T,P)$ on the curve. Therefore, for any infinitesimal displacement $(dT, dP)$ along this curve, the change in $g_{\\alpha}$ must equal the change in $g_{\\beta}$:\n$$dg_{\\alpha} = dg_{\\beta}$$\nSubstituting the differential expression $dg = -s dT + v dP$:\n$$-s_{\\alpha}dT + v_{\\alpha}dP = -s_{\\beta}dT + v_{\\beta}dP$$\nRearranging to group terms with $dT$ and $dP$:\n$$(s_{\\beta} - s_{\\alpha})dT = (v_{\\beta} - v_{\\alpha})dP$$\nSolving for the slope of the coexistence line, $\\frac{dP}{dT}$, gives the Clapeyron equation:\n$$\\frac{dP}{dT} = \\frac{s_{\\beta} - s_{\\alpha}}{v_{\\beta} - v_{\\alpha}} = \\frac{\\Delta s}{\\Delta v}$$\nWe now evaluate this slope at the point $(T_0, P_0)$ using the provided data. The molar quantities are denoted as $S^{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $V^{\\mathrm{m}}$ in the problem.\nThe change in molar entropy is:\n$$\\Delta S^{\\mathrm{m}} = S_{\\beta}^{\\mathrm{m}} - S_{\\alpha}^{\\mathrm{m}} = 36.0\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}} - 38.5\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}} = -2.5\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$$\nThe change in molar volume is:\n$$\\Delta V^{\\mathrm{m}} = V_{\\beta}^{\\mathrm{m}} - V_{\\alpha}^{\\mathrm{m}} = 9.80\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,mol^{-1}} - 1.05\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,mol^{-1}}$$\n$$\\Delta V^{\\mathrm{m}} = (9.80 - 10.5) \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,mol^{-1}} = -0.70 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,mol^{-1}}$$\nNow, we compute the slope:\n$$\\frac{dP}{dT} = \\frac{\\Delta S^{\\mathrm{m}}}{\\Delta V^{\\mathrm{m}}} = \\frac{-2.5\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}}{-0.70 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,mol^{-1}}}$$\nThe units of the result are $\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}\\,m^{-3}}$. Since $1\\,\\mathrm{J} = 1\\,\\mathrm{Pa} \\cdot \\mathrm{m^3}$, the units are equivalent to $\\mathrm{Pa\\,K^{-1}}$.\n$$\\frac{dP}{dT} = \\frac{2.5}{0.70 \\times 10^{-6}}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\,K^{-1}} \\approx 3.5714...\\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\,K^{-1}}$$\nThe problem requires the answer in units of $\\mathrm{MPa\\,K^{-1}}$. Since $1\\,\\mathrm{MPa} = 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, we convert the result:\n$$\\frac{dP}{dT} = 3.5714...\\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\,K^{-1}} \\times \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{MPa}}{10^6\\,\\mathrm{Pa}} = 3.5714...\\,\\mathrm{MPa\\,K^{-1}}$$\nRounding to three significant figures as specified:\n$$\\frac{dP}{dT} \\approx 3.57\\,\\mathrm{MPa\\,K^{-1}}$$",
            "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.57}$$"
