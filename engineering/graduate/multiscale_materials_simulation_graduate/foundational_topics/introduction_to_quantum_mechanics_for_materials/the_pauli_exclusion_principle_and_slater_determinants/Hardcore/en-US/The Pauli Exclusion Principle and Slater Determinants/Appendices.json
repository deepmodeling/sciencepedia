            "introduction": "The Pauli exclusion principle is not just an abstract rule, but has a direct and crucial consequence on the spatial structure of the many-fermion wavefunction. This first practice guides you to prove that for two identical fermions, the wavefunction must vanish when their coordinates coincide, forming what is known as a \"Pauli node.\" Understanding this nodal structure is fundamental to grasping fermionic behavior and is critically important in advanced computational methods like fixed-node Quantum Monte Carlo, where the nodes of a trial wavefunction determine the accuracy of the entire simulation.",

Let $\\Psi(x_{1},x_{2})$ be an antisymmetric spatial wavefunction corresponding to a spin configuration that enforces the Pauli exclusion principle, i.e., $\\Psi(x_{1},x_{2})=-\\Psi(x_{2},x_{1})$, and assume $\\Psi$ is continuous in $(x_{1},x_{2})$.\n\nPart A: Starting from the exchange antisymmetry and continuity, derive the necessary condition on $\\Psi$ at the coincidence line $x_{1}=x_{2}$. Your derivation must begin from the definition of exchange antisymmetry and use only well-tested facts about continuous functions and the properties of determinants.\n\nPart B: In electronic structure methods for materials, Slater determinants are used to enforce antisymmetry at the electronic scale.

No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem is analyzed in three parts as requested.\n\nPart A: Derivation of the condition on the wavefunction at the coincidence line.\n\nThe problem states that the system consists of two identical fermions, and the spatial wavefunction $\\Psi(x_{1},x_{2})$ must be antisymmetric with respect to particle exchange. This is expressed by the relation:\n$$\n\\Psi(x_{1},x_{2}) = -\\Psi(x_{2},x_{1})\n$$\nThis relation must hold for all possible positions $(x_{1}, x_{2})$ of the two particles.\n\nWe are asked to find the necessary condition on $\\Psi$ at the coincidence line, which is defined by the set of points where the particle positions are the same, i.e., $x_{1} = x_{2}$. Let us denote an arbitrary point on this line by $(x, x)$, where $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nTo find the value of the wavefunction on this line, we can evaluate the antisymmetry relation at any such point. Substituting $x_{1} = x$ and $x_{2} = x$ into the equation gives:\n$$\n\\Psi(x, x) = -\\Psi(x, x)\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged by adding $\\Psi(x, x)$ to both sides:\n$$\n2\\Psi(x, x) = 0\n$$\nDividing by the scalar $2$, we arrive at the necessary condition:\n$$\n\\Psi(x, x) = 0\n$$\nThis result must hold for any value of $x$. Therefore, the necessary condition is that the wavefunction $\\Psi$ must be identically zero along the entire coincidence line $x_{1} = x_{2}$. The problem statement specifies that $\\Psi(x_{1},x_{2})$ is a continuous function. This continuity ensures that the value of the function on the line $x_{1}=x_{2}$ is well-defined and can be obtained by taking the limit as $x_{1} \\to x$ and $x_{2} \\to x$, validating the direct substitution performed above. This zero-valued line is often referred to as the Pauli or exchange node.\n\nPart B: Verification that the Slater determinant satisfies the condition.\n\nWe are given a two-particle trial wavefunction in the form of a Slater determinant:\n$$\n\\Psi_{\\text{T}}(x_{1},x_{2}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\big[\\phi_{a}(x_{1})\\phi_{b}(x_{2}) - \\phi_{b}(x_{1})\\phi_{a}(x_{2})\\big]\n$$\nwhere $\\phi_{a}(x)$ and $\\phi_{b}(x)$ are continuous single-particle orbitals. We need to prove that this trial state satisfies the condition derived in Part A, namely that it is zero on the coincidence line $x_{1}=x_{2}$.\n\nTo do this, we evaluate $\\Psi_{\\text{T}}(x_{1},x_{2})$ at an arbitrary point $(x, x)$ on the coincidence line by setting $x_{1} = x$ and $x_{2} = x$:\n$$\n\\Psi_{\\text{T}}(x, x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\big[\\phi_{a}(x)\\phi_{b}(x) - \\phi_{b}(x)\\phi_{a}(x)\\big]\n$$\nThe evaluation of the orbitals $\\phi_{a}(x)$ and $\\phi_{b}(x)$ at a point $x$ yields scalar values. Since scalar multiplication is commutative, we have:\n$$\n\\phi_{a}(x)\\phi_{b}(x) = \\phi_{b}(x)\\phi_{a}(x)\n$$\nSubstituting this identity into the expression for $\\Psi_{\\text{T}}(x, x)$:\n$$\n\\Psi_{\\text{T}}(x, x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\big[\\phi_{a}(x)\\phi_{b}(x) - \\phi_{a}(x)\\phi_{b}(x)\\big] = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(0) = 0\n$$\nThis holds for any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Thus, $\\Psi_{\\text{T}}(x_{1},x_{2})$ is identically zero for all points where $x_{1} = x_{2}$. This proves that the Slater determinant trial wavefunction satisfies the same necessary condition as the exact antisymmetric state. This property is a direct consequence of the determinantal structure, where a determinant with two identical rows (or columns) is always zero. In our case, setting $x_{1}=x_{2}$ makes the two columns of the underlying determinant matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} \\phi_a(x_1) & \\phi_a(x_2) \\\\ \\phi_b(x_1) & \\phi_b(x_2) \\end{pmatrix}$ identical.\n\nPart C: Computation of the nodal error $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{node}}$.\n\nThe nodal error is defined as:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\mathrm{node}} \\equiv \\sup_{X\\in\\mathbb{R}}\\, \\big|s_{*}(X)\\big|\n$$\nwhere $s_{*}(X)$ is the smallest value of the relative coordinate $s=x_{2}-x_{1}$ such that $\\Psi_{\\text{T}}\\big(X-\\tfrac{s}{2},\\,X+\\tfrac{s}{2}\\big)=0$ in a neighborhood of $s=0$. Here, $X=(x_{1}+x_{2})/2$ is the center-of-mass coordinate. The coordinates are related by $x_{1} = X - \\frac{s}{2}$ and $x_{2} = X + \\frac{s}{2}$.\n\nThe condition $\\Psi_{\\text{T}}=0$ defines the nodal set of the trial wavefunction. We are looking for the value of $s$ that satisfies this condition. From Part B, we have rigorously proven that any Slater determinant of the given form is zero whenever its arguments are equal. That is:\n$$\n\\Psi_{\\text{T}}(x_{1}, x_{2}) = 0 \\quad \\text{if} \\quad x_{1} = x_{2}\n$$\nLet us express the condition $x_{1} = x_{2}$ in terms of the relative coordinate $s$:\n$$\ns = x_{2} - x_{1} = 0\n$$\nThis means that for any value of the center-of-mass coordinate $X$, the wavefunction $\\Psi_{\\text{T}}\\big(X-\\tfrac{s}{2},\\,X+\\tfrac{s}{2}\\big)$ is equal to zero when $s=0$.\n\nThe definition of $s_{*}(X)$ is the smallest value of $s$ in a neighborhood of $s=0$ for which the wavefunction vanishes. Since the wavefunction is guaranteed to be zero at $s=0$ for any $X$, and assuming the orbitals $\\phi_a$ and $\\phi_b$ are linearly independent (which is required for a physically meaningful two-fermion state), the node at $s=0$ is isolated. In other words, for a given $X$, there is a neighborhood of $s=0$ where $s=0$ is the *only* solution to $\\Psi_{\\text{T}}=0$. Therefore, the smallest value of $s$ in a neighborhood of $s=0$ where the wavefunction is zero is $s=0$ itself.\n\nSo, for any $X \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have:\n$$\ns_{*}(X) = 0\n$$\nNow we can compute the nodal error $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{node}}$ by taking the supremum over all possible values of $X$:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\mathrm{node}} = \\sup_{X\\in\\mathbb{R}}\\, |s_{*}(X)| = \\sup_{X\\in\\mathbb{R}}\\, |0|\n$$\nThe set of values $\\{|s_*(X)| : X \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$ contains only the single element $0$. The supremum of a set containing only the number $0$ is $0$.\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\mathrm{node}} = 0\n$$\nThis result signifies that the nodal surface of the Slater determinant trial wavefunction *exactly* coincides with the exact Pauli node at $x_{1}=x_{2}$ (or $s=0$). There is no displacement error for this particular part of the nodal surface.",

            "problem": "In multiscale materials simulation, coarse-grained lattice models for correlated electrons are constructed from first-principles inputs to capture low-energy physics. Consider a single-band lattice model in which electrons are created and annihilated at lattice site $i$ with spin $\\sigma \\in \\{\\uparrow,\\downarrow\\}$ by fermionic operators $c_{i\\sigma}^{\\dagger}$ and $c_{i\\sigma}$. The operators obey the canonical anticommutation relations (CAR): $\\{c_{i\\sigma},c_{j\\tau}^{\\dagger}\\}=\\delta_{ij}\\delta_{\\sigma\\tau}$ and $\\{c_{i\\sigma},c_{j\\tau}\\}=\\{c_{i\\sigma}^{\\dagger},c_{j\\tau}^{\\dagger}\\}=0$.

            "solution": "The solution is divided into two parts as requested by the problem statement. First, we will derive the eigenvalues of the number operator $n_{i\\sigma}$. Second, we will use this result to determine the dimension of the local Hilbert space.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Eigenvalues for the Number Operator**\n\nLet us consider a single mode, corresponding to a fixed site $i$ and a fixed spin $\\sigma$. For conciseness, we will temporarily drop the indices and let $c \\equiv c_{i\\sigma}$ and $c^{\\dagger} \\equiv c_{i\\sigma}^{\\dagger}$. The number operator for this mode is $n = c^{\\dagger}c$. The CAR for this single mode are derived from the general relations by setting $i=j$ and $\\sigma=\\tau$:\n$\\{c, c^{\\dagger}\\} = cc^{\\dagger} + c^{\\dagger}c = 1$\n$\\{c, c\\} = cc+cc = 2c^2 = 0 \\implies c^2 = 0$\n$\\{c^{\\dagger}, c^{\\dagger}\\} = c^{\\dagger}c^{\\dagger}+c^{\\dagger}c^{\\dagger} = 2(c^{\\dagger})^2 = 0 \\implies (c^{\\dagger})^2 = 0$\n\nThe properties $c^2=0$ and $(c^{\\dagger})^2=0$ are the mathematical embodiment of the Pauli exclusion principle: it is impossible to annihilate or create two identical fermions in the same quantum state.\n\nOur goal is to find the eigenvalues of the operator $n$. A powerful method is to first determine the algebraic properties of $n$. Let us compute $n^2$:\n$$n^2 = (c^{\\dagger}c)(c^{\\dagger}c) = c^{\\dagger}cc^{\\dagger}c$$\nWe can use the anticommutation relation $\\{c, c^{\\dagger}\\} = 1$ to reorder the operators in the middle. Specifically, $cc^{\\dagger} = 1 - c^{\\dagger}c$. Substituting this into the expression for $n^2$:\n$$n^2 = c^{\\dagger}(cc^{\\dagger})c = c^{\\dagger}(1 - c^{\\dagger}c)c$$\nDistributing the operators, we get:\n$$n^2 = c^{\\dagger}(1)c - c^{\\dagger}(c^{\\dagger}c)c = c^{\\dagger}c - c^{\\dagger}c^{\\dagger}cc$$\nBy associativity of operator products, the second term can be written as $(c^{\\dagger}c^{\\dagger})(cc) = (c^{\\dagger})^2c^2$. As we established from the CAR, $(c^{\\dagger})^2 = 0$ and $c^2=0$. Therefore, this term is zero:\n$$c^{\\dagger}c^{\\dagger}cc = 0$$\nThis simplifies the expression for $n^2$:\n$$n^2 = c^{\\dagger}c - 0 = c^{\\dagger}c = n$$\nThe property $n^2 = n$ indicates that the number operator $n$ is a projection operator. Let $\\lambda$ be an eigenvalue of $n$ and let $|\\psi\\rangle$ be the corresponding non-zero eigenstate, such that $n|\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda|\\psi\\rangle$. Applying the operator $n$ a second time yields:\n$$n(n|\\psi\\rangle) = n(\\lambda|\\psi\\rangle) = \\lambda(n|\\psi\\rangle) = \\lambda(\\lambda|\\psi\\rangle) = \\lambda^2|\\psi\\rangle$$\nHowever, since $n^2=n$, we also have:\n$$n^2|\\psi\\rangle = n|\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda|\\psi\\rangle$$\nEquating the two expressions for $n^2|\\psi\\rangle$, we find:\n$$\\lambda^2|\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda|\\psi\\rangle$$\n$$(\\lambda^2 - \\lambda)|\\psi\\rangle = 0$$\nSince $|\\psi\\rangle$ is an eigenstate, it is non-null ($|\\psi\\rangle \\neq 0$). Thus, the scalar coefficient must be zero:\n$$\\lambda^2 - \\lambda = 0 \\implies \\lambda(\\lambda-1) = 0$$\nThe only possible solutions are $\\lambda=0$ and $\\lambda=1$. Therefore, the allowed eigenvalues of the number operator $n_{i\\sigma}$ are $0$ and $1$. This signifies that a given state (site $i$, spin $\\sigma$) is either unoccupied (occupation number $0$) or occupied by a single electron (occupation number $1$).\n\n**Part 2: Dimension of the Local Hilbert Space**\n\nWe now consider the local Hilbert space (or Fock space) at a single lattice site $i$. This space must account for all possible electron occupations. At this site, there are two distinct spin degrees of freedom, spin-up ($\\sigma=\\uparrow$) and spin-down ($\\sigma=\\downarrow$). Each of these corresponds to an independent fermionic mode, described by operators $c_{i\\uparrow}, c_{i\\uparrow}^{\\dagger}$ and $c_{i\\downarrow}, c_{i\\downarrow}^{\\dagger}$.\n\nThe state of the system at site $i$ is described by the occupation numbers of these two modes. Let $n_{i\\uparrow}$ be the number operator for the spin-up mode and $n_{i\\downarrow}$ be the number operator for the spin-down mode. From Part 1, we know that the eigenvalues of $n_{i\\uparrow}$ can only be $0$ or $1$, and likewise for $n_{i\\downarrow}$.\n\nThe basis states for the local Hilbert space at site $i$ can be labeled by the pair of eigenvalues $(n_{\\uparrow}, n_{\\downarrow})$, where $n_{\\uparrow}$ and $n_{\\downarrow}$ are the occupation numbers for the spin-up and spin-down states, respectively. We can list all possible combinations:\n1.  $(n_{\\uparrow}=0, n_{\\downarrow}=0)$: This state, denoted $|0,0\\rangle_i$, represents an empty site.\n2.  $(n_{\\uparrow}=1, n_{\\downarrow}=0)$: This state, denoted $|1,0\\rangle_i = c_{i\\uparrow}^{\\dagger}|0,0\\rangle_i$, represents a site occupied by a single spin-up electron.\n3.  $(n_{\\uparrow}=0, n_{\\downarrow}=1)$: This state, denoted $|0,1\\rangle_i = c_{i\\downarrow}^{\\dagger}|0,0\\rangle_i$, represents a site occupied by a single spin-down electron.\n4.  $(n_{\\uparrow}=1, n_{\\downarrow}=1)$: This state, denoted $|1,1\\rangle_i = c_{i\\downarrow}^{\\dagger}c_{i\\uparrow}^{\\dagger}|0,0\\rangle_i$, represents a site that is doubly occupied, containing one spin-up and one spin-down electron. The problem explicitly allows for this possibility.\n\nThese four states are mutually orthogonal and form a complete basis for the local on-site Hilbert space. The dimension of a Hilbert space is defined as the number of vectors in a complete orthonormal basis. Since we have identified four such basis states, the dimension of the local Hilbert space is $4$.",

Thus, $S^\\psi = I_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe determinant is $\\det(S^\\psi) = 1$.\n\nThe inter-set overlap matrix is given as:\n$$ S^{\\phi\\psi} = \\begin{pmatrix} c_{1} & 0 \\\\ 0 & c_{2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nIts determinant is $\\det(S^{\\phi\\psi}) = c_1 c_2 - 0 \\times 0 = c_1 c_2$.\n\nSubstituting these determinants into the general formula for the overlap:\n$$ \\langle\\Phi|\\Psi\\rangle = \\frac{c_1 c_2}{\\sqrt{1 \\times 1}} = c_1 c_2 $$\nThe problem provides the numerical values $c_1 = \\frac{3}{5}$ and $c_2 = \\frac{4}{5}$.\nTherefore, the numerical value of the overlap is:\n$$ \\langle\\Phi|\\Psi\\rangle = \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right) \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right) = \\frac{12}{25} $$\nThis is a dimensionless real number, as required.",
