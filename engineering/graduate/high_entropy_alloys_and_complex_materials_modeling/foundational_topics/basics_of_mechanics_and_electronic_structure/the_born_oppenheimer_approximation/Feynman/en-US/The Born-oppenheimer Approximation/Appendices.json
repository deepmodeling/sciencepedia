The problem is well-posed, as all necessary parameters, definitions, and conditions are provided to find a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The parameters are physically reasonable. No flaws related to scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, or ambiguity are found.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is valid.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation separates the electronic and nuclear motion. First, we solve the time-independent electronic Schrödinger equation for fixed nuclear coordinates $Q$:\n$$\nH_e(Q) |\\Psi_n(Q)\\rangle = E_n(Q) |\\Psi_n(Q)\\rangle\n$$\nHere, $E_n(Q)$ are the adiabatic potential energy surfaces (PES) and $|\\Psi_n(Q)\\rangle$ are the corresponding adiabatic electronic eigenstates. For the given Hamiltonian, let $D(Q) = \\Delta + \\kappa Q$. The matrix is:\n$$\nH_{e}(Q) = \\begin{pmatrix} D(Q)  V \\\\ V  -D(Q) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(H_e(Q) - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$\n(D(Q) - \\lambda)(-D(Q) - \\lambda) - V^2 = 0 \\implies \\lambda^2 - D(Q)^2 - V^2 = 0\n$$\nThis gives the two adiabatic surfaces:\n$$\nE_{\\pm}(Q) = \\pm \\sqrt{D(Q)^2 + V^2} = \\pm \\sqrt{(\\Delta + \\kappa Q)^2 + V^2}\n$$\nThe problem concerns the lower adiabatic surface, $E_{-}(Q) = - \\sqrt{(\\Delta + \\kappa Q)^2 + V^2}$.\n\nTo find the corresponding eigenvector $|\\Psi_{-}(Q)\\rangle$, we can parameterize the Hamiltonian using a mixing angle $\\theta(Q)$ such that $\\tan(2\\theta(Q)) = V/D(Q)$. The normalized eigenvector for the lower surface $E_{-}(Q)$ is:\n$$\n|\\Psi_{-}(Q)\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\sin(\\theta(Q)) \\\\ \\cos(\\theta(Q)) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe problem defines the leading BO error as the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction (DBOC), which adds a correction to the BO potential. Within the framework of atomic units ($\\hbar=1$, $m_e=1$), the DBOC for the state $|\\Psi_n(Q)\\rangle$ is given by:\n$$\n\\delta E_n^{\\mathrm{DBOC}}(Q) = \\left\\langle \\Psi_n(Q) \\left| T_N \\right| \\Psi_n(Q) \\right\\rangle_{\\mathrm{el}} = \\left\\langle \\Psi_n(Q) \\left| -\\frac{1}{2M}\\frac{d^2}{dQ^2} \\right| \\Psi_n(Q) \\right\\rangle_{\\mathrm{el}}\n$$\nwhere the subscript 'el' denotes integration over electronic coordinates only.\nFor real and normalized electronic wavefunctions, this expression can be simplified. Using the identity $\\langle \\Psi_n | \\frac{d^2 \\Psi_n}{dQ^2} \\rangle = - \\langle \\frac{d\\Psi_n}{dQ} | \\frac{d\\Psi_n}{dQ} \\rangle$, the DBOC becomes a positive-definite quantity:\n$$\n\\delta E_n^{\\mathrm{DBOC}}(Q) = \\frac{1}{2M} \\left\\langle \\frac{d\\Psi_n}{dQ} \\middle| \\frac{d\\Psi_n}{dQ} \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2M} \\left\\| \\frac{d\\Psi_n(Q)}{dQ} \\right\\|^2\n$$\nWe need to compute this for the lower surface, $|\\Psi_{-}(Q)\\rangle$. First, we find the derivative of the eigenvector with respect to $Q$:\n$$\n\\frac{d|\\Psi_{-}(Q)\\rangle}{dQ} = \\frac{d}{dQ} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\sin(\\theta(Q)) \\\\ \\cos(\\theta(Q)) \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{d\\theta}{dQ} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\cos(\\theta(Q)) \\\\ -\\sin(\\theta(Q)) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe squared norm of this vector is:\n$$\n\\left\\| \\frac{d|\\Psi_{-}(Q)\\rangle}{dQ} \\right\\|^2 = \\left(\\frac{d\\theta}{dQ}\\right)^2 \\left( (-\\cos\\theta)^2 + (-\\sin\\theta)^2 \\right) = \\left(\\frac{d\\theta}{dQ}\\right)^2\n$$\nThe DBOC is therefore $\\delta E_{-}^{\\mathrm{DBOC}}(Q) = \\frac{1}{2M} \\left(\\frac{d\\theta}{dQ}\\right)^2$.\nNext, we determine $\\frac{d\\theta}{dQ}$ from the relation $\\tan(2\\theta) = V/(\\Delta + \\kappa Q)$. Differentiating with respect to $Q$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dQ} \\tan(2\\theta) = 2 \\sec^2(2\\theta) \\frac{d\\theta}{dQ}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dQ} \\left( \\frac{V}{\\Delta + \\kappa Q} \\right) = -\\frac{V \\kappa}{(\\Delta + \\kappa Q)^2}\n$$\nEquating these and using $\\sec^2(2\\theta) = 1 + \\tan^2(2\\theta) = 1 + \\frac{V^2}{(\\Delta+\\kappa Q)^2} = \\frac{(\\Delta+\\kappa Q)^2 + V^2}{(\\Delta+\\kappa Q)^2}$:\n$$\n2 \\left(\\frac{(\\Delta+\\kappa Q)^2 + V^2}{(\\Delta+\\kappa Q)^2}\\right) \\frac{d\\theta}{dQ} = -\\frac{V \\kappa}{(\\Delta+\\kappa Q)^2}\n$$\nSolving for $\\frac{d\\theta}{dQ}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta}{dQ} = -\\frac{V \\kappa}{2 \\left( (\\Delta + \\kappa Q)^2 + V^2 \\right)}\n$$\nThe problem requires this to be evaluated at the avoided crossing coordinate $Q_c$, defined by the condition $\\Delta + \\kappa Q_c = 0$. At this specific point, the derivative simplifies significantly:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{d\\theta}{dQ} \\right|_{Q=Q_c} = -\\frac{V \\kappa}{2 (0^2 + V^2)} = -\\frac{V \\kappa}{2 V^2} = -\\frac{\\kappa}{2V}\n$$\nNow we can compute the DBOC at $Q_c$:\n$$\n\\delta E_{-}^{\\mathrm{DBOC}}(Q_c) = \\frac{1}{2M} \\left( \\left. \\frac{d\\theta}{dQ} \\right|_{Q=Q_c} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2M} \\left( -\\frac{\\kappa}{2V} \\right)^2 = \\frac{\\kappa^2}{8 M V^2}\n$$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the leading BO error.

The potential energy is given by the harmonic Born-Oppenheimer potential, $V_{0}(R) = \\tfrac{1}{2} k_{0} (R - R_{e})^{2}$. This describes a simple harmonic oscillator. The vibrational motion of a diatomic molecule is described by the relative coordinate $R$, and the associated mass is the reduced mass $\\mu$.

The average energy (trace):\n$$\n\\frac{V_{11}(Q_x, Q_y) + V_{22}(Q_x, Q_y)}{2} = E_{0}\n$$\n2. The energy splitting:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{V_{11}(Q_x, Q_y) - V_{22}(Q_x, Q_y)}{2}\\right)^{2} + V_{12}(Q_x, Q_y)^{2} = (\\lambda_{x} Q_{x})^{2} + (\\lambda_{y} Q_{y})^{2}\n$$\nThe problem states that the electronic states couple linearly to the nuclear coordinates. This guides us to seek a solution where the matrix elements of $\\mathbf{V}^{\\mathrm{dia}}$ are linear functions of $Q_x$ and $Q_y$.\nFrom condition 1, we can define a function $W(Q_x, Q_y)$ such that $V_{11} = E_0 + W(Q_x, Q_y)$ and $V_{22} = E_0 - W(Q_x, Q_y)$. With this, the term $\\frac{V_{11} - V_{22}}{2}$ becomes simply $W(Q_x, Q_y)$. Condition 2 then becomes:\n$$\nW(Q_x, Q_y)^{2} + V_{12}(Q_x, Q_y)^{2} = (\\lambda_{x} Q_{x})^{2} + (\\lambda_{y} Q_{y})^{2}\n$$\nWe assume linear forms for $W$ and $V_{12}$:\n$$\nW(Q_x, Q_y) = A Q_x + B Q_y\n$$\n$$\nV_{12}(Q_x, Q_y) = C Q_x + D Q_y\n$$\nwhere $A, B, C, D$ are real constants. Substituting these into the condition gives:\n$$\n(A Q_x + B Q_y)^2 + (C Q_x + D Q_y)^2 = (\\lambda_x Q_x)^2 + (\\lambda_y Q_y)^2\n$$\nExpanding the left side yields:\n$$\n(A^2 + C^2)Q_x^2 + (B^2 + D^2)Q_y^2 + 2(AB+CD)Q_x Q_y = \\lambda_x^2 Q_x^2 + \\lambda_y^2 Q_y^2\n$$\nFor this identity to hold for all values of $Q_x$ and $Q_y$, the coefficients of the polynomial terms must match. This yields a system of three equations for the four unknown coefficients:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nA^2 + C^2 = \\lambda_x^2 \\\\\nB^2 + D^2 = \\lambda_y^2 \\\\\nAB + CD = 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis system is underdetermined, which reflects the rotational freedom in the choice of the diabatic basis. However, the problem's notation with \"symmetry-adapted\" coordinates $Q_x, Q_y$ and corresponding coupling constants $\\lambda_x, \\lambda_y$ suggests a canonical choice. The standard physical model for such a system (a linear vibronic coupling or Jahn-Teller model) assigns one coordinate to tune the diagonal energy difference and the other to provide the off-diagonal coupling. The most natural assignment based on the notation is to associate the terms involving $Q_x$ with one another, and similarly for $Q_y$. This corresponds to setting the cross-term coefficients to zero: $B=0$ and $C=0$.\n\nWith this choice, the system simplifies significantly:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nA^2 = \\lambda_x^2 \\implies A = \\pm \\lambda_x \\\\\nD^2 = \\lambda_y^2 \\implies D = \\pm \\lambda_y \\\\\nA \\cdot 0 + 0 \\cdot D = 0 \\text{(satisfied)}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nWe can choose the positive roots, $A = \\lambda_x$ and $D = \\lambda_y$, without loss of generality, as the signs can be absorbed into the redefinition of the diabatic basis states. This leads to:\n$$\nW(Q_x, Q_y) = \\lambda_x Q_x\n$$\n$$\nV_{12}(Q_x, Q_y) = \\lambda_y Q_y\n$$\nThis defines the diabatic potential matrix elements:\n$$\nV_{11}(Q_x, Q_y) = E_0 + \\lambda_x Q_x\n$$\n$$\nV_{22}(Q_x, Q_y) = E_0 - \\lambda_x Q_x\n$$\n$$\nV_{12}(Q_x, Q_y) = \\lambda_y Q_y\n$$\nThe transformed nuclear Hamiltonian in the diabatic basis, $\\hat{H}_{n}^{\\mathrm{dia}}$, is then given by $\\hat{H}_{n}^{\\mathrm{dia}} = \\hat{T}_n \\mathbf{I} + \\mathbf{V}^{\\mathrm{dia}}$, where $\\mathbf{I}$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix and the derivative couplings are absent:\n$$\n\\hat{H}_{n}^{\\mathrm{dia}} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2M}\\nabla^2 + E_0 + \\lambda_x Q_x  \\lambda_y Q_y \\\\ \\lambda_y Q_y  -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2M}\\nabla^2 + E_0 - \\lambda_x Q_x \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe potential-energy matrix in this Hamiltonian, $\\mathbf{V}^{\\mathrm{dia}}$, is explicitly off-diagonal due to the term $V_{12}^{\\mathrm{dia}} = \\lambda_y Q_y$.\n\nThe problem asks for the closed-form analytic expression for this single off-diagonal potential-energy matrix element, $V_{12}^{\\mathrm{dia}}(Q_{x},Q_{y})$. Based on our derivation, this is $\\lambda_y Q_y$.",
