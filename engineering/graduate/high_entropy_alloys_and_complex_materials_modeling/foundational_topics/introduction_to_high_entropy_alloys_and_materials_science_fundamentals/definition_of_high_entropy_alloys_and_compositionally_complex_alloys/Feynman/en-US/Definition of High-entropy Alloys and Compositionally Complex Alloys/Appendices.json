For one mole of atoms, $N$ is Avogadro's number, $N_A$. The molar configurational entropy, which we denote by the same symbol $S_{\\mathrm{config}}$ for simplicity in this context, is:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{config}} = N_{A} k_{B} \\ln n$$\nUsing the given relation for the molar gas constant, $R = N_{A} k_{B}$, we arrive at the final expression for the ideal molar configurational entropy of mixing for an $n$-component equiatomic alloy:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{config}} = R \\ln n$$\nThe dimensionless quantity to be evaluated is $S_{\\mathrm{config}}/R$.

The calculated molar configurational entropies are:\n- $n=4$ alloy: $S_{\\mathrm{config}} \\approx 1.386R$\n- $n=5$ alloy: $S_{\\mathrm{config}} \\approx 1.609R$\n- $n=6$ alloy: $S_{\\mathrm{config}} \\approx 1.792R$\n\nWe compare these values to the proposed thresholds:\n1.  **Threshold $1.0R$**: All three alloys ($n=4$, $n=5$, $n=6$) have configurational entropies greater than $1.0R$. Under this lenient criterion, all would be considered \"high entropy.\"\n2.  **Threshold $1.5R$**: The $n=5$ and $n=6$ alloys exceed this threshold ($1.609R > 1.5R$ and $1.792R > 1.5R$). The $n=4$ alloy does not ($1.386R  1.5R$). This threshold is significant as it is widely, though informally, used in the materials science literature to define a High-Entropy Alloy (HEA). The basis for this value is that it is surpassed by an equiatomic quinary ($n=5$) alloy, which is the archetypal system for HEAs. Alloys with entropy between $1.0R$ and $1.5R$, like the $n=4$ case, are often termed \"medium-entropy alloys.\"\n3.  **Threshold $2.0R$**: None of the three alloys meet this stringent criterion. An equiatomic alloy would need $n > e^{2.0} \\approx 7.39$ components, meaning $n=8$ or more, to exceed this entropy value.\n\nIn the literature, the term Compositionally Complex Alloy (CCA) serves as a broader category that includes HEAs. CCAs are generally defined as solid solutions containing multiple principal elements in significant concentrations, without a strict entropy requirement. HEAs are a subset of CCAs for which the high configurational entropy (often implying $S_{\\mathrm{config}} \\ge 1.5R$) is considered a defining characteristic that thermodynamically favors the formation of simple solid-solution phases over intermetallic compounds. Based on the common $1.5R$ threshold, the $n=5$ and $n=6$ alloys are classified as HEAs, while the $n=4$ alloy is a CCA (or medium-entropy alloy) but not strictly an HEA.\n\nThe three requested numerical values, expressed as a single row vector, are presented in the final answer.",

The formation of an ordered phase, such as B$2$, is predominantly driven by a negative enthalpy of mixing ($\\Delta H_{mix}  0$), which indicates a strong energetic preference for bonds between unlike atoms. In contrast, the formation of a disordered solid solution is favored by a high configurational entropy of mixing ($\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{config}}$). The Gibbs free energy of mixing, $\\Delta G_{mix} = \\Delta H_{mix} - T\\Delta S_{mix}$, determines the equilibrium phase, where a more negative $\\Delta G_{mix}$ indicates greater stability.\n\n**1. B2 Structure in a 4-Component Equiatomic Alloy**\nThe B$2$ structure consists of two interpenetrating simple cubic sublattices, designated $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. For an equiatomic $4$-component alloy $A_{0.25}B_{0.25}C_{0.25}D_{0.25}$ to form a B$2$ phase, the elements must partition into two groups of two, one for each sublattice. For example, $(A, B)$ on sublattice $\\alpha$ and $(C, D)$ on sublattice $\\beta$, resulting in the formula $(A_{0.5}B_{0.5})_{\\alpha}(C_{0.5}D_{0.5})_{\\beta}$. This partitioning is driven by a strong chemical affinity (large negative $\\Delta H_{mix}$) between the elements in the set $\\{A, B\\}$ and those in the set $\\{C, D\\}$. The principle of \"early–late transition-metal combinations\" points to this exact phenomenon, as these pairs typically exhibit large negative $\\Delta H_{mix}$.\n\n**2. HEA and CCA Definitions**\n-   **Configurational Entropy ($\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{config}}$):** For a random $N$-component equiatomic alloy, the ideal configurational entropy is given by $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{config}} = R \\ln N$, where $R$ is the gas constant.\n-   **HEA Threshold:** A common, albeit not universal, convention classifies an alloy as \"high-entropy\" if the configurational entropy of its random solid solution state is $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{config}} \\ge 1.5R$.\n-   **Compositionally Complex Alloy (CCA):** This is a broader term for alloys containing multiple principal elements (typically $3$ or more), and it encompasses HEAs. Any HEA is also a CCA, but not all CCAs meet the entropy threshold to be considered HEAs.\n\nFor a $4$-component equiatomic alloy, the entropy of the random state is $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{config}, \\mathrm{random}} = R \\ln 4 \\approx 1.386R$. Since $1.386R  1.5R$, such an alloy is generally classified as a CCA, but not strictly as an HEA under this definition.\n\nFor the ordered B$2$ phase $(A_{0.5}B_{0.5})_{\\alpha}(C_{0.5}D_{0.5})_{\\beta}$, the configurational entropy arises from random mixing within each sublattice. The total entropy per mole of atoms is the weighted average of the entropy contributions from each sublattice:\n$$ \\Delta S_{\\mathrm{config}, \\mathrm{ordered}} = 0.5 \\times (-R[0.5 \\ln 0.5 + 0.5 \\ln 0.5]) + 0.5 \\times (-R[0.5 \\ln 0.5 + 0.5 \\ln 0.5]) $$\n$$ \\Delta S_{\\mathrm{config}, \\mathrm{ordered}} = 0.5 (R \\ln 2) + 0.5 (R \\ln 2) = R \\ln 2 \\approx 0.693R $$\nThis value is substantially lower than both the random-state entropy and the $1.5R$ HEA threshold.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. Propose $\\mathrm{Ti}_{0.25}\\mathrm{Zr}_{0.25}\\mathrm{Fe}_{0.25}\\mathrm{Co}_{0.25}$, anticipating B$2$ ordering with the $\\{\\mathrm{Ti},\\mathrm{Zr}\\}$ set on one sublattice and the $\\{\\mathrm{Fe},\\mathrm{Co}\\}$ set on the other due to strong unlike-pair attractions. Its ideal configurational entropy in the ordered state is below typical HEA thresholds; thus it is not an HEA but is a CCA.**\n\n-   **Phase Formation:** The proposed alloy consists of two early transition metals ($\\mathrm{Ti}$, $\\mathrm{Zr}$) and two late transition metals ($\\mathrm{Fe}$, $\\mathrm{Co}$). The heats of mixing between early-late pairs (e.g., $\\mathrm{Ti}-\\mathrm{Fe}$, $\\mathrm{Zr}-\\mathrm{Co}$) are known to be strongly negative. This provides a powerful thermodynamic driving force for ordering. The proposed partitioning of $\\{\\mathrm{Ti}, \\mathrm{Zr}\\}$ onto one sublattice and $\\{\\mathrm{Fe}, \\mathrm{Co}\\}$ onto the other is chemically sound, as it maximizes the number of highly favorable early-late bonds. This proposal is highly consistent with the formation of a B$2$ ordered phase.\n-   **HEA/CCA Classification:** The statement asserts that the configurational entropy in the ordered state is below HEA thresholds. As calculated, $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{config}, \\mathrm{ordered}} \\approx 0.693R$, which is indeed well below the $1.5R$ threshold. The conclusion that the alloy is a CCA (as it is a $4$-component multi-principal-element alloy) but not an HEA (due to its low entropy, especially in the ordered state) is perfectly correct according to common definitions.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**. This option provides a sound chemical basis for the desired structure and a correct classification based on established definitions.\n\n**B. Propose $\\mathrm{Fe}_{0.25}\\mathrm{Co}_{0.25}\\mathrm{Ni}_{0.25}\\mathrm{Al}_{0.25}$, anticipating a single-phase B$2$ because aluminides commonly form B$2$. As an equiatomic $4$-component alloy, it is an HEA and not a CCA.**\n\n-   **Phase Formation:** It is true that aluminides like $\\mathrm{NiAl}$ and $\\mathrm{FeAl}$ are strong B$2$ formers. The driving force is the strong attraction between $\\mathrm{Al}$ and the transition metals. This would favor an ordering where $\\mathrm{Al}$ occupies one sublattice and $\\{\\mathrm{Fe}, \\mathrm{Co}, \\mathrm{Ni}\\}$ occupy the other. However, this would result in a composition of $\\mathrm{Al}_{0.5}(\\mathrm{Fe}_{1/3}\\mathrm{Co}_{1/3}\\mathrm{Ni}_{1/3})_{0.5}$, which is not equiatomic in all four elements ($50\\%$ $\\mathrm{Al}$, $16.7\\%$ each for $\\mathrm{Fe, Co, Ni}$). This contradicts the problem's premise of an equiatomic $A_{0.25}B_{0.25}C_{0.25}D_{0.25}$ alloy. While a B$2$ phase might form, its existence as an equiatomic quaternary is not straightforwardly predicted by this simple analogy.\n-   **HEA/CCA Classification:** The statement \"it is an HEA and not a CCA\" is logically false. The set of HEAs is a subset of the set of CCAs. An alloy cannot be an HEA *without* also being a CCA. Furthermore, as established, a $4$-component equiatomic alloy, with $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{config}, \\mathrm{random}} \\approx 1.386R$, does not meet the common $1.5R$ entropy threshold for an HEA.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The HEA/CCA classification is logically and factually incorrect.\n\n**C. Propose $\\mathrm{Fe}_{0.25}\\mathrm{Ni}_{0.25}\\mathrm{Co}_{0.25}\\mathrm{Cr}_{0.25}$, anticipating a disordered single-phase body-centered cubic solution driven by high configurational entropy; as a multi-principal equiatomic alloy it is a CCA but not an HEA.**\n\n-   **Phase Formation:** This alloy (often called the Cantor alloy, though that is typically FCC and contains Mn) is composed of neighboring $3d$ transition metals. The heats of mixing among these elements are small, providing no significant driving force for chemical ordering. The prediction that it would form a *disordered* solid solution is therefore correct. However, this directly contradicts the problem's goal of designing an *ordered* B$2$ structure. Therefore, this proposal fails to meet the primary design requirement.\n-   **HEA/CCA Classification:** The classification as \"a CCA but not an HEA\" is consistent with the analysis that $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{config}, \\mathrm{random}} \\approx 1.386R  1.5R$. This part of the statement is reasonable.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. Although the analysis of this specific alloy system is plausible, it is proposed as an unsuitable candidate for the stated goal of achieving a B$2$ ordered phase.\n\n**D. Propose $\\mathrm{Ti}_{0.25}\\mathrm{Zr}_{0.25}\\mathrm{Fe}_{0.25}\\mathrm{Co}_{0.25}$, anticipating single-phase B$2$ ordering, and classify it as both an HEA and a CCA because its equiatomic $4$-component ideal configurational entropy meets or exceeds common HEA thresholds.**\n\n-   **Phase Formation:** As with option A, the proposed alloy is an excellent candidate for forming an ordered B$2$ phase. This part of the statement is correct.\n-   **HEA/CCA Classification:** The statement claims the alloy is an HEA because its entropy \"meets or exceeds common HEA thresholds.\" This is factually incorrect. The ideal configurational entropy for a random $4$-component equiatomic alloy is $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{config}} = R \\ln 4 \\approx 1.386R$, which is *below* the common threshold of $1.5R$. The argument for its HEA classification is based on a false premise. If one considers the entropy of the final ordered state ($\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{config}} = R \\ln 2 \\approx 0.693R$), the claim is even more incorrect.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The justification for the HEA classification is factually wrong.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption A is the only choice that presents a chemically sound proposal for achieving the target B$2$ structure and provides a correct and nuanced classification of the resulting alloy according to common modern definitions. The reasoning correctly identifies the low entropy of the ordered state as a key factor in its classification.",
