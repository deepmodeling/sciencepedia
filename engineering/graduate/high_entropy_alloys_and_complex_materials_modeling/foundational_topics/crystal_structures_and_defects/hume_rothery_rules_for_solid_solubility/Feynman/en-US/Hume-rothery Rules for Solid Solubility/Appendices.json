            "problem": "A binary alloy of species $A$ and $B$ is considered within the framework of the Hume-Rothery rules for substitutional solid solubility in complex, multi-principal systems such as high-entropy alloys (HEAs). Assume that both species adopt the same crystal structure (e.g., Face-Centered Cubic (FCC)) in the relevant composition range, and that the metallic radii $r_A$ and $r_B$ are measured in the same coordination environment. Starting from the notion that the elastic strain energy associated with inserting a solute atom of radius $r_B$ into a host lattice of radius $r_A$ scales with the square of the fractional size misfit, and that the sign of the misfit does not affect the magnitude of the strain penalty, define an atomic size mismatch parameter $\\delta_{AB}$ as a dimensionless measure of the absolute fractional difference between $r_B$ and $r_A$. Then, based on widely reported empirical observations underlying the Hume-Rothery criteria, state the commonly adopted threshold magnitude for $\\delta_{AB}$ that correlates with extensive substitutional solid solubility in binary alloys. Finally, for $r_A = 128$ pm and $r_B = 140$ pm, evaluate $\\delta_{AB}$ and provide a brief interpretation of whether extensive solubility is expected on the basis of the size mismatch criterion alone. Express the final numerical value for $\\delta_{AB}$ as a pure number (dimensionless) and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires a three-part response: a formal definition of the atomic size mismatch parameter $\\delta_{AB}$, a statement of the empirical Hume-Rothery threshold for this parameter, and a calculation and interpretation for a specific binary system.\n\nFirst, we define the atomic size mismatch parameter, $\\delta_{AB}$. The problem states that a solute atom of radius $r_B$ is being inserted into a host lattice of radius $r_A$. The fractional size misfit is the difference in radii relative to the host atom's radius. The problem also specifies that the strain energy is insensitive to the sign of the misfit, which implies we should use the absolute value. Therefore, the dimensionless atomic size mismatch parameter $\\delta_{AB}$ is defined as the absolute fractional difference between the solute radius $r_B$ and the host radius $r_A$:\n$$\n\\delta_{AB} = \\left| \\frac{r_B - r_A}{r_A} \\right|\n$$\n\nSecond, we state the commonly accepted empirical criterion for extensive solid solubility based on the atomic size factor, as formulated by Hume-Rothery. This rule posits that for two elements to exhibit a high degree of mutual solid solubility, their atomic radii must be similar. The quantitative threshold for this \"similarity\" is established from extensive empirical observations on binary alloys. Extensive substitutional solid solubility is generally observed when the percentage difference in atomic radii, $100\\% \\times \\delta_{AB}$, is less than approximately $15\\%$. Expressed in terms of the dimensionless parameter $\\delta_{AB}$, the size factor is considered favorable for forming an extensive solid solution if:\n$$\n\\delta_{AB} < 0.15\n$$\nIf $\\delta_{AB}$ exceeds this threshold, solid solubility is expected to be limited or restricted.\n\nThird, we evaluate $\\delta_{AB}$ for the given atomic radii and interpret the result. The problem provides the host atom radius $r_A = 128 \\text{ pm}$ and the solute atom radius $r_B = 140 \\text{ pm}$. We substitute these values into the defined formula for $\\delta_{AB}$:\n$$\n\\delta_{AB} = \\left| \\frac{140 \\text{ pm} - 128 \\text{ pm}}{128 \\text{ pm}} \\right|\n$$\nThe units of picometers ($\\text{pm}$) in the numerator and denominator cancel, yielding a dimensionless quantity as required.\n$$\n\\delta_{AB} = \\left| \\frac{12}{128} \\right| = \\frac{12}{128}\n$$\nSimplifying the fraction gives:\n$$\n\\delta_{AB} = \\frac{3}{32}\n$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal value gives:\n$$\n\\delta_{AB} = 0.09375\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The number $0.09375$ has exactly four significant figures (the digits $9$, $3$, $7$, and $5$), so no further rounding is necessary.\n\nFinally, we provide an interpretation. The calculated value is $\\delta_{AB} = 0.09375$. We compare this to the empirical threshold:\n$$\n0.09375 < 0.15\n$$\nSince the calculated atomic size mismatch is less than the $15\\%$ threshold, the size factor is favorable for forming an extensive substitutional solid solution. Based on this criterion alone, the alloy system composed of species $A$ and $B$ is expected to exhibit a high degree of solid solubility. It is important to acknowledge that this prediction is based solely on the size factor; a complete analysis would also require satisfying the other Hume-Rothery rules regarding crystal structure (which is given as satisfied), electronegativity, and valence.",

Your discussion will be graded qualitatively; the graded numerical answer is only $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}}$ as specified above.",
            "solution": "The first task is to compute the molar enthalpy of mixing, $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}}$, for the equiatomic quaternary alloy. The governing equation is the regular solution model's expression for a multicomponent system:\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}} = \\sum_{i<j} \\Omega_{ij}\\, x_i x_j\n$$\nThe system consists of four components, $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$. The summation over $i<j$ includes all unique pairs of these components. The number of such pairs is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2} = 6$. The pairs are $(A,B)$, $(A,C)$, $(A,D)$, $(B,C)$, $(B,D)$, and $(C,D)$.\n\nThe molar compositions are given as equiatomic: $x_A = x_B = x_C = x_D = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nSince all mole fractions $x_i$ are equal to $\\frac{1}{4}$, the product $x_i x_j$ is constant for all pairs:\n$$\nx_i x_j = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{16}\n$$\nThe expression for $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}}$ can thus be written as:\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}} = \\frac{1}{16} \\sum_{i<j} \\Omega_{ij} = \\frac{1}{16} (\\Omega_{AB} + \\Omega_{AC} + \\Omega_{AD} + \\Omega_{BC} + \\Omega_{BD} + \\Omega_{CD})\n$$\nThe interaction parameters are given in units of $\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$:\n$\\Omega_{AB} = -5$\n$\\Omega_{AC} = +8$\n$\\Omega_{AD} = -2$\n$\\Omega_{BC} = +6$\n$\\Omega_{BD} = -3$\n$\\Omega_{CD} = +4$\n\nWe sum these parameters:\n$$\n\\sum_{i<j} \\Omega_{ij} = (-5) + 8 + (-2) + 6 + (-3) + 4 = 3 - 2 + 6 - 3 + 4 = 1 + 6 - 3 + 4 = 7 - 3 + 4 = 8\n$$\nThe total sum of the interaction parameters is $+8 \\, \\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n\nNow, we can calculate $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}} = \\frac{1}{16} \\times (8 \\, \\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}) = \\frac{8}{16} \\, \\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\, \\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} = 0.5 \\, \\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\n$$\n\nFor the second part of the question, we analyze the implications of this result for solid solubility. The thermodynamic criterion for the spontaneous formation of a single-phase solution is that the Gibbs free energy of mixing, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{mix}}$, is negative and represents the global minimum free energy state for the system at a given temperature $T$ and pressure. The Gibbs free energy of mixing is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{mix}} = \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}} - T\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}\n$$\nThe stability of the random solid solution depends on the interplay between the enthalpy of mixing, $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}}$, and the entropy of mixing, $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}$.\n\nThe ideal configurational entropy of mixing is given by $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}} = -R \\sum_i x_i \\ln x_i$, where $R$ is the ideal gas constant. For the equiatomic quaternary alloy:\n$$\n\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}} = -R \\left( x_A \\ln x_A + x_B \\ln x_B + x_C \\ln x_C + x_D \\ln x_D \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}} = -R \\left( 4 \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\ln\\frac{1}{4} \\right) = -R \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = -R (-\\ln 4) = R \\ln 4\n$$\nSince $R > 0$ and $\\ln 4 > 0$, the entropy of mixing $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}$ is always positive. A positive $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}$ reflects the increase in disorder upon random mixing of the components. Consequently, the entropic contribution to the Gibbs free energy, $-T\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}} = -T R \\ln 4$, is always negative for any temperature $T > 0$ and strongly favors mixing.\n\nThe enthalpy of mixing, $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}}$, which we calculated to be $+0.5 \\, \\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, is positive. A positive enthalpy of mixing signifies that, on average, the formation of unlike-atom bonds is energetically less favorable than the persistence of like-atom bonds. This term energetically disfavors mixing and promotes phase separation (demixing or clustering).\n\nThe Hume-Rothery rules provide empirical guidelines for predicting high solid solubility. One key principle, related to chemical affinity, suggests that elements with very different electronegativities (leading to a large negative $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}}$) tend to form ordered intermetallic compounds, while elements with very large positive $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}}$ are immiscible and will phase separate. Extensive formation of a random solid solution is therefore favored when $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}}$ is close to zero (either slightly negative or slightly positive).\n\nIn this case, $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}} = +0.5 \\, \\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$ is a very small positive value. This indicates that the energetic penalty for mixing is minimal. The overall tendency is a weak repulsion between unlike atoms when averaged over all pairs.\nThe Gibbs free energy of mixing is:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{mix}} = 0.5 \\, \\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} - T (R \\ln 4)\n$$\nAt any non-zero temperature, the entropic term $-T \\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}$ will work to make $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{mix}}$ negative. Because the enthalpic penalty ($+0.5 \\, \\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$) is very small, the entropy term will dominate even at relatively low temperatures, leading to a negative $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{mix}}$ and the stabilization of the single-phase random solid solution. While a miscibility gap (a temperature range where phase separation occurs) technically exists for any system with $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}} > 0$, the small magnitude of $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}}$ implies that the critical temperature for this gap would be very low, and the solid solution is likely to be stable over a wide range of practical temperatures.\n\nIn summary, the calculated small positive value of $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}}$ is highly conducive to the formation of a single-phase random solid solution, a condition central to the design of high-entropy alloys and consistent with the spirit of the Hume-Rothery rules for extensive solubility. It avoids the two extremes: strong ordering tendency (large negative $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}}$) and strong phase separation tendency (large positive $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}}$).\n\nAssumptions invoked in this discussion include:\n1. The regular solution model accurately describes the alloy's enthalpy.\n2. The entropy of mixing is purely configurational and ideal, neglecting vibrational, electronic, or magnetic contributions.\n3. The pairwise interaction parameters $\\Omega_{ij}$ are constant, independent of temperature and composition.\n4. The analysis considers only the competition between a random solid solution and a phase-separated state, not the formation of other more complex ordered or intermetallic phases that are not captured by this model.\n5. The system is able to achieve its thermodynamic equilibrium state.",

Using the universal gas constant $R \\approx 8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$:\n    $$ \\Delta S_{\\text{mix}} \\approx 8.314 \\times \\ln(5) \\approx 8.314 \\times 1.6094 \\approx 13.382\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}} $$\n    $$ \\Omega = \\frac{(1769\\,\\mathrm{K}) (13.382\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}})}{|2400\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}|} = \\frac{23672.6}{2400} \\approx 9.864 $$\n\n**Decision based on Combined Criteria**\nWe now compare the calculated values with the given empirical thresholds for single-phase solid solution formation.\n- **$\\delta$ criterion**: $\\delta \\leq 6.6 \\times 10^{-2}$. Our calculation gives $\\delta \\approx 1.033 \\times 10^{-2}$. Since $1.033 \\times 10^{-2} \\leq 6.6 \\times 10^{-2}$, this criterion is **satisfied**.\n- **$\\Delta H_{\\text{mix}}$ criterion**: $-15 \\leq \\Delta H_{\\text{mix}} \\leq 5$ in $\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$. Our calculation gives $\\Delta H_{\\text{mix}} = 2.4\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$. Since $-15 \\leq 2.4 \\leq 5$, this criterion is **satisfied**.\n- **$\\Delta \\chi$ criterion**: $\\Delta \\chi \\leq 0.1$. Our calculation gives $\\Delta \\chi \\approx 0.09222$. Since $0.09222 \\leq 0.1$, this criterion is **satisfied**.\n- **$VEC$ criterion**: $VEC \\geq 8$. Our calculation gives $VEC = 8.8$. Since $8.8 \\geq 8$, this criterion is **satisfied**.\n- **$\\Omega$ criterion**: $\\Omega \\geq 1.1$. Our calculation gives $\\Omega \\approx 9.864$. Since $9.864 \\geq 1.1$, this criterion is **satisfied**.\n\nSince all five criteria are satisfied, the combined set of parameters supports the candidacy of the equiatomic CoCrFeNiCu alloy for forming a single-phase solid solution. Therefore, the binary indicator $b$ is $1$.",
