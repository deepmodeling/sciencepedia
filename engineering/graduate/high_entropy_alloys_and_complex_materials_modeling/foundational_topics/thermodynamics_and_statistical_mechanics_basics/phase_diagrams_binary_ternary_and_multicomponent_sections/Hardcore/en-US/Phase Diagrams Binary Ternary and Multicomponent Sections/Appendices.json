This corresponds to the limit of local stability of the solution against infinitesimal composition fluctuations. First, we compute the first derivative, $\\frac{dG}{dx}$:\n$$\\frac{dG}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\Omega(x-x^2) + RT\\big[x\\ln(x) + (1-x)\\ln(1-x)\\big] \\right)$$\nApplying the product rule and chain rule for the entropy term:\n$$\\frac{d}{dx}\\big[x\\ln(x)\\big] = (1)\\ln(x) + x(\\frac{1}{x}) = \\ln(x) + 1$$\n$$\\frac{d}{dx}\\big[(1-x)\\ln(1-x)\\big] = (-1)\\ln(1-x) + (1-x)\\left(\\frac{1}{1-x}\\right)(-1) = -\\ln(1-x) - 1$$\nSubstituting these back into the expression for $\\frac{dG}{dx}$:\n$$\\frac{dG}{dx} = \\Omega(1-2x) + RT\\big[(\\ln(x)+1) + (-\\ln(1-x)-1)\\big]$$\n$$\\frac{dG}{dx} = \\Omega(1-2x) + RT\\big[\\ln(x) - \\ln(1-x)\\big] = \\Omega(1-2x) + RT\\ln\\left(\\frac{x}{1-x}\\right)$$\nNext, we compute the second derivative, $\\frac{d^{2}G}{dx^{2}}$:\n$$\\frac{d^{2}G}{dx^{2}} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\Omega(1-2x) + RT\\big[\\ln(x) - \\ln(1-x)\\big] \\right)$$\n$$\\frac{d^{2}G}{dx^{2}} = \\Omega(-2) + RT\\left(\\frac{1}{x} - \\frac{1}{1-x}(-1)\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{d^{2}G}{dx^{2}} = -2\\Omega + RT\\left(\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{1-x}\\right)$$\nCombining the terms in the parenthesis:\n$$\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{1-x} = \\frac{(1-x) + x}{x(1-x)} = \\frac{1}{x(1-x)}$$\nThus, the second derivative is:\n$$\\frac{d^{2}G}{dx^{2}} = \\frac{RT}{x(1-x)} - 2\\Omega$$\nThe spinodal condition is $\\frac{d^{2}G}{dx^{2}} = 0$.

For a real solution to exist, the discriminant of the quadratic equation, which is the term under the square root, must be non-negative:\n$$1 - \\frac{2RT}{\\Omega} \\ge 0$$\nFirst, we ensure unit consistency. The interaction parameter is given as $\\Omega = 8\\,\\mathrm{kJ/mol}$, which must be converted to Joules per mole:\n$$\\Omega = 8\\,\\mathrm{kJ/mol} = 8000\\,\\mathrm{J/mol}$$\nNow, we compute the dimensionless term $\\frac{2RT}{\\Omega}$:\n$$\\frac{2RT}{\\Omega} = \\frac{2 \\times (8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (900\\,\\mathrm{K})}{8000\\,\\mathrm{J/mol}}$$\n$$\\frac{2RT}{\\Omega} = \\frac{14965.2}{8000} = 1.87065$$\nNow we evaluate the discriminant:\n$$1 - \\frac{2RT}{\\Omega} = 1 - 1.87065 = -0.87065$$\nSince the discriminant is negative ($-0.87065  0$), the square root is an imaginary number. Consequently, there are no real-valued solutions for the spinodal composition $x_{\\mathrm{s}}$ at $T = 900\\,\\mathrm{K}$. This indicates that the temperature is above the critical temperature of mixing, $T_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\frac{\\Omega}{2R}$, and the system forms a stable single-phase solid solution across the entire composition range.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, if no real-valued spinodal compositions exist, the answer must be the general closed-form analytic expression for $x_{\\mathrm{s}}$.

The total Gibbs free energy for a system containing $n$ total moles is $G = n G_m(x)$.

The boundary is thus defined by the condition $\\Delta G(x,T) = G_{\\mathrm{dis}}(x,T) - G_{\\mathrm{ord}}(x,T) = 0$.\n\nThe molar Gibbs free energy is defined as $G = H - TS$. Therefore, the difference is:\n$$\n\\Delta G(x,T) = (H_{\\mathrm{dis}} - H_{\\mathrm{ord}}) - T(S_{\\mathrm{dis}} - S_{\\mathrm{ord}}) = \\Delta H(x) - T \\Delta S(x)\n$$\nAccording to the problem statement, the disordered phase has a composition-independent molar enthalpy penalty $\\Delta H_0$.\n$$\n\\Delta H(x) = H_{\\mathrm{dis}} - H_{\\mathrm{ord}} = \\Delta H_{0}\n$$\nThe problem also states that the ordered compound has negligible configurational entropy ($S_{\\mathrm{ord,config}} \\approx 0$) and that the only entropic contribution to the difference comes from the ideal configurational entropy of the disordered phase ($S_{\\mathrm{dis}} = S_{\\mathrm{config, ideal}}$).\n$$\n\\Delta S(x) = S_{\\mathrm{dis}}(x) - S_{\\mathrm{ord}}(x) \\approx S_{\\mathrm{config, ideal}}(x) - 0 = S_{\\mathrm{config, ideal}}(x)\n$$\nThe ideal molar configurational entropy of mixing for a multicomponent system is derived from the Boltzmann entropy formula, $S = k_B \\ln \\Omega$, applied to one mole of atoms ($N_A$ atoms) and using Stirling's approximation. For a ternary system with mole fractions $x_{\\mathrm{A}}$, $x_{\\mathrm{B}}$, and $x_{\\mathrm{C}}$, the result is the well-known formula:\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{config, ideal}}(x) = -R \\sum_{i=\\mathrm{A,B,C}} x_i \\ln x_i = -R (x_{\\mathrm{A}} \\ln x_{\\mathrm{A}} + x_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln x_{\\mathrm{B}} + x_{\\mathrm{C}} \\ln x_{\\mathrm{C}})\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant.\n\nAt the order–disorder transition temperature, $T_{\\mathrm{od}}$, we set $\\Delta G = 0$:\n$$\n\\Delta H_0 - T_{\\mathrm{od}}(x) \\Delta S(x) = 0\n$$\nSolving for the transition temperature, $T_{\\mathrm{od}}(x)$:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{od}}(x) = \\frac{\\Delta H_0}{\\Delta S(x)} = \\frac{\\Delta H_0}{-R (x_{\\mathrm{A}} \\ln x_{\\mathrm{A}} + x_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln x_{\\mathrm{B}} + x_{\\mathrm{C}} \\ln x_{\\mathrm{C}})}\n$$\nWe now apply this formula to the two specified compositions using the given values: $\\Delta H_{0}=3.00\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}} = 3000\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}}$ and $R=8.314\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}$.\n\nFirst, for the equiatomic composition, $\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\mathrm{eq}}=\\left(\\frac{1}{3},\\frac{1}{3},\\frac{1}{3}\\right)$:\nThe entropy term is:\n$$\n\\sum x_i \\ln x_i = \\frac{1}{3}\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) + \\frac{1}{3}\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) + \\frac{1}{3}\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = 3 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = -\\ln(3)\n$$\nThe transition temperature is:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{od}}(\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\mathrm{eq}}) = \\frac{\\Delta H_0}{-R(-\\ln(3))} = \\frac{\\Delta H_0}{R \\ln(3)}\n$$\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{od}}(\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\mathrm{eq}}) = \\frac{3000\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}}}{8.314\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}} \\times \\ln(3)} \\approx 328.4199\\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$\nNext, for the skewed composition, $\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\mathrm{sk}}=\\left(0.8,0.1,0.1\\right)$:\nThe entropy term is:\n$$\n\\sum x_i \\ln x_i = 0.8 \\ln(0.8) + 0.1 \\ln(0.1) + 0.1 \\ln(0.1) = 0.8 \\ln(0.8) + 0.2 \\ln(0.1)\n$$\n$$\n\\sum x_i \\ln x_i \\approx 0.8(-0.223144) + 0.2(-2.302585) \\approx -0.178515 - 0.460517 \\approx -0.639032\n$$\nThe transition temperature is:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{od}}(\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\mathrm{sk}}) = \\frac{\\Delta H_0}{-R (0.8 \\ln(0.8) + 0.2 \\ln(0.1))}\n$$\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{od}}(\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\mathrm{sk}}) = \\frac{3000\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}}}{-8.314\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}} \\times (-0.639032)} \\approx \\frac{3000}{5.313506}\\ \\mathrm{K} \\approx 564.5778\\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the shift in temperature, $\\Delta T$:\n$$\n\\Delta T = T_{\\mathrm{od}}(\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\mathrm{sk}}) - T_{\\mathrm{od}}(\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\mathrm{eq}})\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta T \\approx 564.5778\\ \\mathrm{K} - 328.4199\\ \\mathrm{K} = 236.1579\\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$\nThe positive value of $\\Delta T$ signifies that the skewed composition becomes disordered at a much higher temperature than the equiatomic composition. This is because the configurational entropy, which stabilizes the disordered phase, is maximized at the equiatomic composition. Consequently, the equiatomic alloy can remain disordered down to a lower temperature before the enthalpy advantage of the ordered phase dominates. This entropy-driven stabilization of the solid solution phase is a central tenet of the high-entropy alloy design philosophy.\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures:\n$$\n\\Delta T \\approx 236.2\\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$",
