            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically-grounded exercise in fundamental statistical mechanics, using a standard ideal solution model which is a common starting point for the study of complex alloys. The problem statement is objective, self-contained, and free of contradictions. The assumptions and objectives are clearly articulated, allowing for a rigorous and unambiguous mathematical derivation.\n\nThe first task is to compute the canonical partition function $Z(\\beta,V,\\mathbf{n})$. By definition, the canonical partition function is the sum of Boltzmann factors over all distinct microstates $\\nu$ of the system:\n$$ Z(\\beta,V,\\mathbf{n}) = \\sum_{\\nu} \\exp(-\\beta E_{\\nu}) $$\nwhere $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse temperature and $E_{\\nu}$ is the energy of microstate $\\nu$.\n\nFor the given system, a microstate is a specific arrangement of a fixed number of atoms of each species, $\\mathbf{n} = (n_1, \\dots, n_K)$, on $N$ distinguishable lattice sites. The problem specifies a rigid-lattice ideal solution model, where the interaction energy between species is zero. This crucial assumption means that the total configurational energy of the system is independent of the specific arrangement of atoms. Consequently, the energy $E_{\\nu}$ is the same for all microstates consistent with the composition $\\mathbf{n}$ and volume $V$. We denote this constant energy as $E_0(\\mathbf{n},V)$.\n\nThe partition function expression can thus be simplified. Since the term $\\exp(-\\beta E_0(\\mathbf{n},V))$ is constant for all microstates, it can be factored out of the summation:\n$$ Z(\\beta,V,\\mathbf{n}) = \\sum_{\\nu} \\exp(-\\beta E_0(\\mathbf{n},V)) = \\exp(-\\beta E_0(\\mathbf{n},V)) \\sum_{\\nu} 1 $$\nThe sum $\\sum_{\\nu} 1$ represents the total number of distinct microstates, or configurational degeneracy, which we denote as $\\Omega(\\mathbf{n})$. This is a combinatorial problem: to find the number of ways to arrange $n_1$ indistinguishable atoms of species $1$, $n_2$ of species $2$, ..., and $n_K$ of species $K$ on $N$ distinguishable lattice sites, subject to the constraint $\\sum_{i=1}^{K} n_i = N$.\n\nThis number is given by the multinomial coefficient. We can determine it by considering the sequential placement of atoms. There are $\\binom{N}{n_1}$ ways to choose the sites for the $n_1$ atoms of species $1$. After this, there are $N-n_1$ sites left, so there are $\\binom{N-n_1}{n_2}$ ways to place the $n_2$ atoms of species $2$. This continues for all species. The total number of ways is the product:\n$$ \\Omega(\\mathbf{n}) = \\binom{N}{n_1} \\binom{N-n_1}{n_2} \\cdots \\binom{N - \\sum_{j=1}^{K-1} n_j}{n_K} = \\frac{N!}{n_1!(N-n_1)!} \\frac{(N-n_1)!}{n_2!(N-n_1-n_2)!} \\cdots \\frac{n_K!}{n_K!(0)!} $$\nAfter canceling terms, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\Omega(\\mathbf{n}) = \\frac{N!}{n_1! n_2! \\cdots n_K!} = \\frac{N!}{\\prod_{i=1}^{K} n_i!} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $Z$, we obtain the canonical partition function:\n$$ Z(\\beta,V,\\mathbf{n}) = \\frac{N!}{\\prod_{i=1}^{K} n_i!} \\exp(-\\beta E_0(\\mathbf{n},V)) $$\nThis is the answer to the first part of the problem.\n\nThe second task is to derive the ideal configurational Helmholtz free energy, $F_{\\mathrm{conf}}$, from $Z$ using the relation $F = -k_B T \\ln Z$.\n$$ F(\\beta,V,\\mathbf{n}) = -k_B T \\ln \\left( \\frac{N!}{\\prod_{i=1}^{K} n_i!} \\exp(-\\beta E_0) \\right) = -k_B T \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{N!}{\\prod_{i=1}^{K} n_i!}\\right) - \\beta E_0 \\right] $$\n$$ F = -k_B T \\left( \\ln(N!) - \\sum_{i=1}^{K} \\ln(n_i!) \\right) + E_0(\\mathbf{n},V) $$\nThe free energy is composed of an energetic part, $E_0$, and a configurational part, $F_{\\mathrm{conf}}$, which arises from the entropy of mixing.\n$$ F_{\\mathrm{conf}} = -k_B T \\left( \\ln(N!) - \\sum_{i=1}^{K} \\ln(n_i!) \\right) $$\nIn the thermodynamic limit ($N, n_i \\to \\infty$ with fixed ratios $n_i/N$), we can apply Stirling's approximation, $\\ln(m!) \\approx m \\ln(m) - m$.

In the perfectly ordered state, species $A$ occupies sublattice $\\alpha$ and species $B$ occupies sublattice $\\beta$. In a high-entropy alloy (HEA) or complex alloy exhibiting B2 order, antisite defects can be present: an antisite defect is a site occupied by the \"wrong\" species relative to the ideal order (i.e., a $B$ atom on an $\\alpha$ site or an $A$ atom on a $\\beta$ site).

            "solution": "The problem asks for the configurational entropy per lattice site, $s(c) \\equiv S/N$, for an equiatomic B2-ordered binary alloy as a function of the antisite defect concentration, $c$. We will use the microcanonical ensemble definition of entropy, $S = k_B \\ln W$, where $W$ is the total number of accessible microstates (configurations) for a given macrostate defined by $c$. The thermodynamic limit ($N \\to \\infty$) is assumed.\n\nFirst, let us formalize the number of atoms of each species on each sublattice. The system has a total of $N$ lattice sites, divided into two interpenetrating sublattices, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, each with $N/2$ sites.

The total number of sites with antisite defects is therefore $cN$. Due to the equiatomic stoichiometry and the requirement that antisite defects occur in pairs (one $A$ on $\\beta$ and one $B$ on $\\alpha$), the number of $B$ atoms on the $\\alpha$ sublattice, $N_{B}^{\\alpha}$, must equal the number of $A$ atoms on the $\\beta$ sublattice, $N_{A}^{\\beta}$.\nThe total number of wrong atoms is $N_{B}^{\\alpha} + N_{A}^{\\beta} = cN$.\nFrom this, we deduce:\n$N_{B}^{\\alpha} = N_{A}^{\\beta} = \\frac{cN}{2}$.\n\nNow we can determine the number of \"right\" atoms on each sublattice.\nOn sublattice $\\alpha$, the total number of sites is $N/2$.

Moreover, $\\Omega(\\{N_{s\\alpha}\\})$ is purely combinatorial and does not depend on $T$, so\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{conf}}(\\{N_{s\\alpha}\\}) = k_B \\ln \\Omega(\\{N_{s\\alpha}\\}) = k_B \\sum_{s=1}^{M} \\left[\\ln(N_s!) - \\sum_{\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{S}_s} \\ln(N_{s\\alpha}!)\\right].\n$$\n\nTo obtain a closed-form expression in the thermodynamic limit $N_s \\to \\infty$ for all $s$, we apply Stirling’s approximation to the factorials. Using $\\ln(n!) = n \\ln n - n + \\mathcal{O}(\\ln n)$, the leading-order expression for the entropy becomes\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{conf}} \\approx k_B \\sum_{s=1}^{M} \\left[N_s \\ln N_s - N_s - \\sum_{\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{S}_s} \\left(N_{s\\alpha} \\ln N_{s\\alpha} - N_{s\\alpha}\\right)\\right].\n$$\nWithin each sublattice $s$, the linear terms in $N$ cancel because $\\sum_{\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{S}_s} N_{s\\alpha} = N_s$, yielding\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{conf}} \\approx k_B \\sum_{s=1}^{M} \\left[N_s \\ln N_s - \\sum_{\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{S}_s} N_{s\\alpha} \\ln N_{s\\alpha}\\right].\n$$\nIntroduce site fractions $y_{s\\alpha} \\equiv N_{s\\alpha}/N_s$ so that $N_{s\\alpha} = y_{s\\alpha} N_s$ and $\\sum_{\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{S}_s} y_{s\\alpha} = 1$. Substituting and simplifying gives\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nS_{\\mathrm{conf}} \\approx k_B \\sum_{s=1}^{M} \\left[N_s \\ln N_s - \\sum_{\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{S}_s} \\left(y_{s\\alpha} N_s\\right) \\left(\\ln y_{s\\alpha} + \\ln N_s\\right)\\right] \\\\\n= k_B \\sum_{s=1}^{M} \\left[N_s \\ln N_s - N_s \\sum_{\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{S}_s} y_{s\\alpha} \\ln y_{s\\alpha} - \\left(\\ln N_s\\right) \\sum_{\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{S}_s} y_{s\\alpha} N_s \\right] \\\\\n= k_B \\sum_{s=1}^{M} \\left[N_s \\ln N_s - N_s \\sum_{\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{S}_s} y_{s\\alpha} \\ln y_{s\\alpha} - N_s \\ln N_s \\right] \\\\\n= - k_B \\sum_{s=1}^{M} N_s \\sum_{\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{S}_s} y_{s\\alpha} \\ln y_{s\\alpha}.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThe thermodynamic-limit expression (which becomes exact in the limit $N_s \\to \\infty$) for the ideal configurational entropy on a multi-sublattice lattice is thus\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{conf}} = - k_B \\sum_{s=1}^{M} N_s \\sum_{\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{S}_s} y_{s\\alpha} \\ln y_{s\\alpha}.\n$$\nThis expression is in joules per kelvin when $k_B$ is taken as the Boltzmann constant in joules per kelvin and the $y_{s\\alpha}$ are dimensionless site fractions.",
