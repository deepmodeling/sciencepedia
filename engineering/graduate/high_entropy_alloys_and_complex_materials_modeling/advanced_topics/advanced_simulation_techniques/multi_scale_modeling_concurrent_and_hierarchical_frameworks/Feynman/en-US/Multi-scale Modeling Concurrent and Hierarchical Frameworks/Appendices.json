It is a standard thermodynamic calculation applied to materials science, specifically high-entropy alloys, and all necessary data and conditions are provided without contradiction.\n\nThe primary task is to calculate the molar Gibbs free energy of mixing, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{mix}}$, for a quinary high-entropy alloy at a given state. The fundamental thermodynamic relationship defining this quantity is:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{mix}} = \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}} - T \\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}}$ is the molar enthalpy of mixing, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}$ is the molar entropy of mixing.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\nThe molar enthalpy of mixing, $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}} = -5.0\\,\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\nThe temperature, $T = 1200\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nThe molar entropy of mixing, $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}$, must be calculated.

A negative value for $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{mix}}$, as calculated here, indicates that the formation of the random solid solution from its pure constituent elements is a thermodynamically spontaneous process. The large magnitude of the negative value ($|\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{mix}}| \\gg 0$) suggests a high driving force for mixing and, consequently, a high stability of the disordered, single-phase solid solution at this temperature. This stability arises from both an energetically favorable (negative) enthalpy of mixing and a large, positive configurational entropy of mixing, which is characteristic of high-entropy alloys. In a concurrent atomistic-continuum model, this result from continuum-level thermodynamics implies that the system has a strong tendency to remain a disordered solid solution. It would resist phenomena such as chemical ordering (formation of intermetallic compounds) or phase separation into multiple phases, which would correspond to less negative, or even positive, changes in Gibbs free energy. An atomistic simulation coupled with this continuum model would be expected to show atomic configurations that are consistent with a random distribution, thereby validating the assumption of a high-entropy state.",

The overlap region is further discretized into $N = \\lfloor L_{\\mathrm{o}}/\\Delta x \\rfloor$ homogeneous cells of width $\\Delta x$.\n\nThe solution involves two types of operators:\n1.  **Interface Transfer Matrix $\\mathbf{T}$**: This matrix relates the wave amplitudes across an interface between two different media.\n2.  **Propagation Matrix $\\mathbf{P}$**: This matrix describes the phase evolution of the wave amplitudes as they travel across a homogeneous cell.\n\nBy composing these matrices in the correct order, we construct a total transfer matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ that relates the wave amplitudes in the MD region, $\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{MD}}$, to those in the FE region, $\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{FE}}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{FE}} = \\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{MD}}\n$$\n\n**Step 1: Derivation of the Interface Transfer Matrix**\nAt an interface between a \"left\" medium (L) and a \"right\" medium (R), we enforce the continuity of displacement $U(x)$ and traction. The problem defines traction as $\\sigma(x) = E(x)\\frac{dU}{dx}$. Let the interface be at $x_i$.\nContinuity of displacement: $U_L(x_i) = U_R(x_i)$\n$$\nA_L + B_L = A_R + B_R\n$$\nContinuity of traction: $E_L U_L'(x_i) = E_R U_R'(x_i)$\n$$\nE_L (\\mathrm{i}k_L A_L - \\mathrm{i}k_L B_L) = E_R (\\mathrm{i}k_R A_R - \\mathrm{i}k_R B_R)\n$$\nUsing the 'traction coefficient' $r = E k = E (\\omega/c) = \\omega\\sqrt{E\\rho}$, this simplifies to:\n$$\nr_L (A_L - B_L) = r_R (A_R - B_R)\n$$\nSolving these two linear equations for $A_R$ and $B_R$ in terms of $A_L$ and $B_L$ yields the interface transfer matrix $\\mathbf{T}_{L\\to R}$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} A_R \\\\ B_R \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 + r_L/r_R & 1 - r_L/r_R \\\\ 1 - r_L/r_R & 1 + r_L/r_R \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} A_L \\\\ B_L \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThus, $\\mathbf{T}_{L\\to R} = \\frac{1}{2r_R} \\begin{pmatrix} r_R+r_L & r_R-r_L \\\\ r_R-r_L & r_R+r_L \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**Step 2: Derivation of the Propagation Matrix**\nWithin a homogeneous cell $j$ of width $\\Delta x$ and wavenumber $k_j$, the wave propagates from its entrance at $x_{in}$ to its exit at $x_{out} = x_{in} + \\Delta x$. The amplitudes at the exit ($A_{out}, B_{out}$) are related to the amplitudes at the entrance ($A_{in}, B_{in}$) by a simple phase shift:\n$$\nA_{out} = A_{in} e^{\\mathrm{i}k_j \\Delta x} \\quad , \\quad B_{out} = B_{in} e^{-\\mathrm{i}k_j \\Delta x}\n$$\nThis defines the propagation matrix $\\mathbf{P}_j$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{P}_j = \\begin{pmatrix} e^{\\mathrm{i}k_j \\Delta x} & 0 \\\\ 0 & e^{-\\mathrm{i}k_j \\Delta x} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Construction of the Total Transfer Matrix**\nThe overlap region consists of $N$ cells, indexed $j=0, \\dots, N-1$. The material properties for cell $j$ are calculated using a linear blending rule with the normalized coordinate $s_j = j/N$:\n$E_j = E_{\\mathrm{MD}} + (E_{\\mathrm{FE}} - E_{\\mathrm{MD}})s_j$\n$\\rho_j = \\rho_{\\mathrm{MD}} + (\\rho_{\\mathrm{FE}} - \\rho_{\\mathrm{MD}})s_j$\nFrom these, we compute $k_j = \\omega/\\sqrt{E_j/\\rho_j}$ and $r_j = \\omega\\sqrt{E_j\\rho_j}$.\n\nNote that for cell $j=0$, $s_0=0$, which implies $E_0=E_{\\mathrm{MD}}$ and $\\rho_0=\\rho_{\\mathrm{MD}}$. Consequently, the interface between the MD region and cell $0$ is non-reflecting, and its transfer matrix $\\mathbf{T}_{\\mathrm{MD}\\to 0}$ is the identity matrix.\n\nThe total transfer matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ is the ordered product of all propagation and interface matrices from the beginning of the overlap region to the FE region:\n$$\n\\mathbf{M} = \\mathbf{T}_{N-1 \\to \\mathrm{FE}} \\cdot \\mathbf{P}_{N-1} \\cdot \\mathbf{T}_{N-2 \\to N-1} \\cdots \\mathbf{T}_{0 \\to 1} \\cdot \\mathbf{P}_0\n$$\nwhere the matrix for the first interface $\\mathbf{T}_{\\mathrm{MD}\\to 0}$ is omitted as it is the identity.\n\n**Step 4: Calculation of the Reflection Coefficient**\nThe incident wave comes from the MD side, so we can normalize its amplitude to $A_{\\mathrm{MD}}=1$. The reflected amplitude is $B_{\\mathrm{MD}} = R$, where $R$ is the reflection coefficient. Thus, $\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{MD}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ R \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe outgoing-only condition on the FE side means there is no wave coming from $x=+\\infty$, so $B_{\\mathrm{FE}} = 0$. Hence, $\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{FE}} = \\begin{pmatrix} A_{\\mathrm{FE}} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the global relation $\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{FE}} = \\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{MD}}$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} A_{\\mathrm{FE}} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} M_{11} & M_{12} \\\\ M_{21} & M_{22} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ R \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe second row gives the equation $0 = M_{21} \\cdot 1 + M_{22} \\cdot R$, from which we solve for $R$:\n$$\nR = - \\frac{M_{21}}{M_{22}}\n$$\n\n**Step 5: Optimization**\nFor each candidate overlap length $L_{\\mathrm{o}}$, we perform the above calculation to find the reflection coefficient $R(L_{\\mathrm{o}})$. Then, we evaluate the objective function:\n$$\nJ(L_{\\mathrm{o}}) = |R(L_{\\mathrm{o}})| + \\alpha L_{\\mathrm{o}}\n$$\nWe compute $J(L_{\\mathrm{o}})$ for every $L_{\\mathrm{o}}$ in the provided candidate set and select the one that yields the minimum value of $J$. This $L_{\\mathrm{o}}$ is the optimal overlap length, $L_{\\mathrm{o}}^{\\star}$. This entire procedure is repeated for each test case.\n\nThe algorithm to be implemented is as follows:\nFor each test case:\n1. Initialize a list to store results $(J, L_{\\mathrm{o}})$.\n2. For each candidate $L_{\\mathrm{o}}$:\n    a. Calculate $N = \\lfloor L_{\\mathrm{o}}/\\Delta x \\rfloor$.\n    b. Compute material properties ($r_j$, $k_j$) for all $N$ cells, as well as for the FE region ($r_{\\mathrm{FE}}$).\n    c. Sequentially construct the total transfer matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ by pre-multiplying the constituent matrices in reverse order of propagation, starting from $\\mathbf{P}_0$ up to $\\mathbf{T}_{N-1 \\to \\mathrm{FE}}$.\n    d. Calculate $R = -M_{21}/M_{22}$.\n    e. Calculate $J(L_{\\mathrm{o}}) = |R| + \\alpha L_{\\mathrm{o}}$.\n    f. Store the pair $(J(L_{\\mathrm{o}}), L_{\\mathrm{o}})$.\n3. Find the pair with the minimum $J$ value. The corresponding $L_{\\mathrm{o}}$ is the optimal length $L_{\\mathrm{o}}^{\\star}$ for this test case.\n4. After processing all test cases, the final results are formatted and printed.",
