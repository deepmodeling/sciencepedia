            "solution": "The problem is to determine the Peach–Koehler force per unit length on a straight screw dislocation in a specified stress field. The solution involves applying the Peach–Koehler formula, which defines the force density $\\mathbf{f}$ (force per unit length) on a dislocation with line sense vector $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$ and Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}$ subjected to a Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$.\n\nThe Peach–Koehler formula is given by:\n$$ \\mathbf{f} = (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}) \\times \\boldsymbol{\\xi} $$\nIn index notation, using the Einstein summation convention, this is expressed as:\n$$ f_i = \\epsilon_{ijk} (\\sigma_{jl} b_l) \\xi_k $$\nwhere $\\epsilon_{ijk}$ is the Levi-Civita permutation symbol. We will use the direct vector formalism.\n\nFirst, we define the relevant vectors and the tensor from the problem statement. The coordinate system is a right-handed orthonormal basis $\\{\\hat{x}, \\hat{y}, \\hat{z}\\}$.\n\nThe dislocation line is oriented along the Cartesian axis $\\hat{z}$. We choose the line sense vector $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$ to be parallel to this axis.\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\xi} = \\hat{z} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThe Burgers vector is given as $\\mathbf{b} = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{nm}\\,\\hat{z}$.

The only specified non-zero component is the shear stress $\\sigma_{xz} = 150\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$. Since the Cauchy stress tensor is symmetric, we must have $\\sigma_{zx} = \\sigma_{xz}$.

The direction of the force is along the negative $y$-axis ($-\\hat{y}$).\n\nFor a screw dislocation, the glide plane is any plane containing the line direction. The force vector $\\mathbf{f}$ lies in the plane perpendicular to the dislocation line and drives the motion of the line. The direction of this force, $-\\hat{y}$, is therefore the direction of dislocation glide. The dislocation line moves in the direction of the force, so the implied glide direction is along the negative $y$-axis. The plane of glide is the one containing both the line direction ($\\hat{z}$) and the velocity direction ($-\\hat{y}$), which is the $yz$-plane.\n\nThe problem asks for the signed $y$-component of the Peach–Koehler force per unit length, which we denote as $f_y$. From the vector expression $\\mathbf{f} = -b \\sigma_{xz} \\hat{y}$, we can directly identify this component:\n$$ f_y = -b \\sigma_{xz} $$\nThe negative sign indicates the force component is directed along the negative $y$-axis, consistent with the convention that the positive direction is along $+\\hat{y}$.\n\nFinally, we substitute the numerical values to compute the result.\nThe magnitude of the Burgers vector is $b = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 0.25 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\nThe shear stress is $\\sigma_{xz} = 150\\,\\mathrm{MPa} = 150 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{N/m^2}$.\n$$ f_y = - (0.25 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}) \\times (150 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{N/m^2}) $$\n$$ f_y = - (0.25 \\times 150) \\times 10^{-9+6}\\,\\mathrm{N/m} $$\n$$ f_y = -37.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{N/m} $$\n$$ f_y = -0.0375\\,\\mathrm{N/m} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The number $-0.0375$ has exactly three significant figures ($3$, $7$, and $5$). Thus, no further rounding is needed. The final numerical value for the signed $y$-component of the force per unit length is $-0.0375\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$.",
