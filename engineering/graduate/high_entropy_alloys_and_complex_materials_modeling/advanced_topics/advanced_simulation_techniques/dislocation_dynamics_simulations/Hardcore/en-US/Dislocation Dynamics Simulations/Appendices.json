            "solution": "The problem is to determine the Peach–Koehler force per unit length on a straight screw dislocation in a specified stress field. The solution involves applying the Peach–Koehler formula, which defines the force density $\\mathbf{f}$ (force per unit length) on a dislocation with line sense vector $\\mathbf{t}$ and Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}$ subjected to a Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$.\n\nConsistent with the main text, the Peach–Koehler formula is given by:\n$$ \\mathbf{f} = (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}) \\times \\mathbf{t} $$\nIn index notation, using the Einstein summation convention, this is expressed as:\n$$ f_k = \\epsilon_{k i j} (\\sigma_{i l} b_l) t_j $$\nwhere $\\epsilon_{kij}$ is the Levi-Civita permutation symbol. We will use the direct vector formalism, which is more straightforward for this problem.\n\nFirst, we must define the relevant vectors and the tensor from the given problem statement. The coordinate system is a right-handed orthonormal basis $\\{\\hat{x}, \\hat{y}, \\hat{z}\\}$.\n\nThe dislocation line is oriented along the Cartesian axis $\\hat{z}$. We choose the line sense vector $\\mathbf{t}$ to be parallel to this axis.\n$$ \\mathbf{t} = \\hat{z} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThe Burgers vector is given as $\\mathbf{b} = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{nm}\\,\\hat{z}$.

The only specified non-zero component is the shear stress $\\sigma_{xz} = 150\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$. Since the Cauchy stress tensor is symmetric, we must have $\\sigma_{zx} = \\sigma_{xz}$. All other components are stated to be zero, including $\\sigma_{yz}=0$. The stress tensor in matrix form is therefore:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{xx}  \\sigma_{xy}  \\sigma_{xz} \\\\ \\sigma_{yx}  \\sigma_{yy}  \\sigma_{yz} \\\\ \\sigma_{zx}  \\sigma_{zy}  \\sigma_{zz} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  \\sigma_{xz} \\\\ 0  0  0 \\\\ \\sigma_{xz}  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nwhere $\\sigma_{xz} = 150\\,\\mathrm{MPa} = 150 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{N/m^2}$.\n\nThe first step in calculating the force is to compute the vector resulting from the operation $(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{b})$.

The direction of the force is along the negative $y$-axis ($-\\hat{y}$).\n\nFor a screw dislocation, the glide plane is any plane containing the line direction. The force vector $\\mathbf{f}$ lies in the plane perpendicular to the dislocation line and drives the motion of the line. The direction of this force, $-\\hat{y}$, is therefore the direction of dislocation glide. The dislocation line moves in the direction of the force, so the implied glide direction is along the negative $y$-axis. The plane of glide is the one containing both the line direction ($\\hat{z}$) and the velocity direction ($-\\hat{y}$), which is the $yz$-plane.\n\nThe problem asks for the signed $y$-component of the Peach–Koehler force per unit length, which we denote as $f_y$. From the vector expression $\\mathbf{f} = -b \\sigma_{xz} \\hat{y}$, we can directly identify this component:\n$$ f_y = -b \\sigma_{xz} $$\nThe negative sign indicates the force component is directed along the negative $y$-axis, consistent with the convention that the positive direction is along $+\\hat{y}$.\n\nFinally, we substitute the numerical values to compute the result.\nThe magnitude of the Burgers vector is $b = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 0.25 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\nThe shear stress is $\\sigma_{xz} = 150\\,\\mathrm{MPa} = 150 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{N/m^2}$.\n$$ f_y = - (0.25 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}) \\times (150 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{N/m^2}) $$\n$$ f_y = - (0.25 \\times 150) \\times 10^{-9+6}\\,\\mathrm{N/m} $$\n$$ f_y = -37.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{N/m} $$\n$$ f_y = -0.0375\\,\\mathrm{N/m} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The number $-0.0375$ has exactly three significant figures ($3$, $7$, and $5$). Thus, no further rounding is needed. The final numerical value for the signed $y$-component of the force per unit length is $-0.0375\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$.",
