High-entropy oxides (HEOs) of the fluorite structure are a current and widely studied class of materials. The use of charge neutrality to determine vacancy concentration is a fundamental principle in defect chemistry. The elements and structure are physically realistic.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined.

It is a valid problem.\n\n## SOLUTION\n\nThe total molar configurational entropy, $S_{m, \\text{config}}$, of the disordered ceramic is the sum of the molar configurational entropies of the cation sublattice, $S_{m, \\text{cat}}$, and the anion sublattice, $S_{m, \\text{an}}$. This is based on the assumption that the arrangements on the two sublattices are independent.\n$$ S_{m, \\text{config}} = S_{m, \\text{cat}} + S_{m, \\text{an}} $$\nThe configurational entropy for a sublattice is derived from the Boltzmann relation $S = k_B \\ln W$, where $W$ is the number of ways to arrange the species on the lattice sites. For an ideal random solution (ideal mixing), the molar entropy of mixing is given by:\n$$ S_m = -R \\sum_{i} x_i \\ln(x_i) $$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $x_i$ is the site fraction of species $i$ on the sublattice. A scaling factor must be applied based on the number of sites per formula unit.\n\nFirst, we calculate the molar configurational entropy of the cation sublattice, $S_{m, \\text{cat}}$. The fluorite structure has $1$ cation site per formula unit. Thus, for $1$ mole of formula units, there is $1$ mole of cation sites. The cation site fractions, $y_i$, are given.\n$$ S_{m, \\text{cat}} = - (1) \\cdot R \\sum_{i=1}^{5} y_i \\ln(y_i) $$\nThe given cation site fractions are $y_{\\mathrm{Zr}^{4+}} = 0.25$, $y_{\\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}} = 0.15$, $y_{\\mathrm{Y}^{3+}} = 0.20$, $y_{\\mathrm{Gd}^{3+}} = 0.20$, and $y_{\\mathrm{Sm}^{3+}} = 0.20$.\n$$ S_{m, \\text{cat}} = -R [0.25 \\ln(0.25) + 0.15 \\ln(0.15) + 0.20 \\ln(0.20) + 0.20 \\ln(0.20) + 0.20 \\ln(0.20)] $$\n$$ S_{m, \\text{cat}} = -R [0.25 \\ln(0.25) + 0.15 \\ln(0.15) + 3 \\times 0.20 \\ln(0.20)] $$\n\nNext, we calculate the molar configurational entropy of the anion sublattice, $S_{m, \\text{an}}$. We must first determine the site fractions of oxide ions ($x_{\\mathrm{O}}$) and vacancies ($x_{\\mathrm{Va}}$) on this sublattice using the principle of charge neutrality.\nThe average cation charge, $\\langle q_{\\text{cat}} \\rangle$, is calculated as the sum of the products of each cation's site fraction and its charge:\n$$ \\langle q_{\\text{cat}} \\rangle = \\sum_{i} y_i q_i $$\n$$ \\langle q_{\\text{cat}} \\rangle = (0.25 \\times 4) + (0.15 \\times 4) + (0.20 \\times 3) + (0.20 \\times 3) + (0.20 \\times 3) $$\n$$ \\langle q_{\\text{cat}} \\rangle = 1.00 + 0.60 + 0.60 + 0.60 + 0.60 = 3.40 $$\nFor each formula unit, which contains one cation, the total positive charge is $+3.40$. To maintain neutrality, the total negative charge must be $-3.40$. This charge is provided by oxide ions, $\\mathrm{O}^{2-}$. Let $N_{\\mathrm{O}}$ be the number of oxide ions per formula unit.\n$$ N_{\\mathrm{O}} \\times (-2) = -3.40 \\implies N_{\\mathrm{O}} = \\frac{3.40}{2} = 1.70 $$\nThe fluorite structure has $2$ anion sites per formula unit. The number of oxygen vacancies, $N_{\\mathrm{Va}}$, per formula unit is the difference between the total number of anion sites and the number of occupied sites:\n$$ N_{\\mathrm{Va}} = 2 - N_{\\mathrm{O}} = 2 - 1.70 = 0.30 $$\nThe site fractions on the anion sublattice are then:\n$$ x_{\\mathrm{O}} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{O}}}{2} = \\frac{1.70}{2} = 0.85 $$\n$$ x_{\\mathrm{Va}} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{Va}}}{2} = \\frac{0.30}{2} = 0.15 $$\nNote that $x_{\\mathrm{O}} + x_{\\mathrm{Va}} = 0.85 + 0.15 = 1.00$.\nSince there are $2$ moles of anion sites per mole of formula units, the molar configurational entropy of the anion sublattice is:\n$$ S_{m, \\text{an}} = - (2) \\cdot R \\sum_{j=1}^{2} x_j \\ln(x_j) $$\n$$ S_{m, \\text{an}} = -2R [x_{\\mathrm{O}} \\ln(x_{\\mathrm{O}}) + x_{\\mathrm{Va}} \\ln(x_{\\mathrm{Va}})] $$\n$$ S_{m, \\text{an}} = -2R [0.85 \\ln(0.85) + 0.15 \\ln(0.15)] $$\n\nThe total molar configurational entropy is the sum of the two contributions:\n$$ S_{m, \\text{config}} = S_{m, \\text{cat}} + S_{m, \\text{an}} $$\n$$ S_{m, \\text{config}} = -R \\left( [0.25 \\ln(0.25) + 0.15 \\ln(0.15) + 3 \\times 0.20 \\ln(0.20)] + 2[0.85 \\ln(0.85) + 0.15 \\ln(0.15)] \\right) $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value using $R = 8.31446261815324\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$.\nFirst, calculate the dimensionless entropy terms:\nFor the cation sublattice:\n$$ \\sum y_i \\ln(y_i) = 0.25 \\ln(0.25) + 0.15 \\ln(0.15) + 0.60 \\ln(0.20) $$\n$$ \\sum y_i \\ln(y_i) \\approx 0.25(-1.38629) + 0.15(-1.89712) + 0.60(-1.60944) $$\n$$ \\sum y_i \\ln(y_i) \\approx -0.34657 - 0.28457 - 0.96566 = -1.59680 $$\nFor the anion sublattice:\n$$ \\sum x_j \\ln(x_j) = 0.85 \\ln(0.85) + 0.15 \\ln(0.15) $$\n$$ \\sum x_j \\ln(x_j) \\approx 0.85(-0.16252) + 0.15(-1.89712) $$\n$$ \\sum x_j \\ln(x_j) \\approx -0.13814 - 0.28457 = -0.42271 $$\nNow combine them into the full expression for $S_{m, \\text{config}}$:\n$$ S_{m, \\text{config}} = -R \\left( (-1.59680) + 2(-0.42271) \\right) $$\n$$ S_{m, \\text{config}} = -R (-1.59680 - 0.84542) $$\n$$ S_{m, \\text{config}} = -R (-2.44222) = 2.44222 \\times R $$\n$$ S_{m, \\text{config}} = 2.44222 \\times 8.31446261815324\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}} $$\n$$ S_{m, \\text{config}} \\approx 20.30556\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}} $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $20.31\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$.",

The use of standard characterization techniques (TGA, XPS) and established data (Shannon ionic radii) is appropriate. The provided experimental data are self-consistent. The TGA result ($O/M = 1.00$) and XPS data (all cations are $M^{2+}$) combine to suggest a charge-neutral formula of $M^{2+}O^{2-}$. This is a logical and physically plausible scenario. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a deductive analysis of the candidate crystal structures. All terms are standard and well-defined in materials science. No scientific flaws, contradictions, or ambiguities are present.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe solution requires identifying the crystal structure archetype that is most consistent with the experimentally determined stoichiometry, charge states, and principles of crystal chemistry.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Stoichiometry and Charge Neutrality**:\n    The system is an equimolar mixture of five cations: $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Co}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$, and $\\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$.\n    The XPS data confirms that these cations are predominantly in the $+2$ oxidation state. Therefore, the average charge of a cation, denoted by $M$, is $+2$.\n    The TGA data establishes the oxygen-to-total-cation ratio as $O/M = 1.00 \\pm 0.02$. This implies that for every one mole of total cations, there is one mole of oxygen atoms. The empirical formula of the oxide is therefore $MO$.\n    We must verify this against the principle of charge neutrality. The anion is oxygen, which typically forms the $O^{2-}$ ion. For the formula $MO$, we have one cation $M$ with an average charge of $+2$ and one anion $O$ with a charge of $-2$. The net charge is $(+2) + (-2) = 0$. The stoichiometry and charge states are thus perfectly self-consistent for a compound with the general formula $MO$.\n\n2.  **Evaluation of Crystal Structure Options**:\n    We will now evaluate each proposed crystal structure archetype based on its characteristic formula and stoichiometry.\n\n    *   **A. Rocksalt $AO$**:\n        The rocksalt structure has a general formula of $AO$, representing a $1:1$ ratio of cations to anions. In this structure, a single cation site ($A$) and a single anion site ($O$) exist. The five divalent cations ($M^{2+}$) would randomly occupy the $A$ site, forming a high-entropy solid solution. The anions ($O^{2-}$) would occupy the $O$ site. The stoichiometry $O/M = 1/1 = 1.00$ exactly matches the TGA data. This is a very strong candidate.\n\n    *   **B. Fluorite $AO_2$**:\n        The fluorite structure has a general formula of $AO_2$. The oxygen-to-cation ratio is $O/A = 2/1 = 2.00$. This is in stark contradiction to the experimental value of $O/M = 1.00 \\pm 0.02$. Furthermore, for charge neutrality with $O^{2-}$ anions, the cation must be $A^{4+}$. The given cations are all $M^{2+}$. This option is inconsistent.\n\n    *   **C. Spinel $AB_2O_4$**:\n        The spinel structure has a general formula of $AB_2O_4$. There are two distinct cation sites, $A$ and $B$. The total number of cations is $3$ ($1$ $A$ and $2$ $B$), and the number of oxygen anions is $4$. The oxygen-to-total-cation ratio is $O/M_{total} = 4/3 \\approx 1.33$. This value is significantly different from the experimental $O/M = 1.00$. This option is inconsistent.\n\n    *   **D. Perovskite $ABO_3$**:\n        The perovskite structure has a general formula of $ABO_3$. There are two distinct cation sites, $A$ and $B$. The total number of cations is $2$, and the number of oxygen anions is $3$. The oxygen-to-total-cation ratio is $O/M_{total} = 3/2 = 1.50$. This is inconsistent with the experimental $O/M = 1.00$. This option is inconsistent.\n\n    *   **E. Ruddlesden–Popper $A_2BO_4$**:\n        The Ruddlesden–Popper (n=1) structure has a general formula of $A_2BO_4$. There are two distinct cation sites, $A$ and $B$. The total number of cations is $3$, and the number of oxygen anions is $4$. The oxygen-to-total-cation ratio is $O/M_{total} = 4/3 \\approx 1.33$. This is inconsistent with the experimental $O/M = 1.00$. This option is inconsistent.\n\n3.  **Confirmation using Ionic Radii and Pauling's Rules**:\n    The analysis of stoichiometry definitively points to the rocksalt structure. We can further check for consistency using the provided ionic radii and Pauling's first rule (the radius ratio rule).\n    The rocksalt structure features both cations and anions in $6$-fold (octahedral) coordination. The stability of this coordination is often assessed by the radius ratio, $r_{cation}/r_{anion}$.\n    The anion is $O^{2-}$ with $r(\\mathrm{O}^{2-},6) \\approx 1.38\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$.\n    For the cation site, which is occupied by an equimolar mixture of five cations, we calculate the average cation radius, $\\bar{r}_{cat}$:\n    $$ \\bar{r}_{cat}(6) = \\frac{1}{5} \\left[ r(\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+},6) + r(\\mathrm{Ni}^{2+},6) + r(\\mathrm{Co}^{2+},6) + r(\\mathrm{Cu}^{2+},6) + r(\\mathrm{Zn}^{2+},6) \\right] $$\n    $$ \\bar{r}_{cat}(6) = \\frac{1}{5} \\left[ (0.72) + (0.69) + (0.745) + (0.73) + (0.74) \\right]\\,\\mathrm{\\AA} = \\frac{3.625}{5}\\,\\mathrm{\\AA} = 0.725\\,\\mathrm{\\AA} $$\n    The radius ratio is:\n    $$ \\frac{\\bar{r}_{cat}(6)}{r(\\mathrm{O}^{2-},6)} = \\frac{0.725\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}}{1.38\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}} \\approx 0.525 $$\n    For stable octahedral ($6$-fold) coordination, the ideal radius ratio is expected to be in the range $[0.414, 0.732]$. The calculated value of $\\approx 0.525$ falls comfortably within this range, indicating that the octahedral coordination of cations in the rocksalt structure is geometrically stable for this system.\n    Finally, the formation of a high-entropy oxide is driven by the large configurational entropy gain at high temperature, which favors a simple crystal structure with a single cation sublattice where the different cation species can be randomly distributed. The rocksalt structure, with its single cation site, is the ideal candidate for maximizing this entropy.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A. Rocksalt $AO$**: This structure has a $1:1$ cation-to-anion stoichiometry, which perfectly matches the experimental $O/M = 1.00$ ratio. The requirement for cations to be $A^{2+}$ to balance $O^{2-}$ is met. The calculated average cation radius leads to a radius ratio that predicts stable $6$-fold coordination, as found in the rocksalt structure. This option is fully consistent with all provided data and principles.\n    **Verdict: Correct**\n\n*   **B. Fluorite $AO_2$**: This structure has an incorrect stoichiometry ($O/A=2$) and would require $A^{4+}$ cations for charge balance.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n*   **C. Spinel $AB_2O_4$**: This structure has an incorrect stoichiometry ($O/M_{total}=4/3 \\approx 1.33$).\n    **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n*   **D. Perovskite $ABO_3$**: This structure has an incorrect stoichiometry ($O/M_{total}=3/2 = 1.5$).\n    **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n*   **E. Ruddlesden–Popper $A_2BO_4$**: This structure has an incorrect stoichiometry ($O/M_{total}=4/3 \\approx 1.33$).\n    **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nThe only structure compatible with the fundamental constraints of stoichiometry and charge neutrality derived from the experimental data is the rocksalt structure.",

To construct an SQS, start from the following fundamental base:\n\n- Probability theory for random mixing: under ideal random mixing at composition $\\{p_i\\}$, the probability that a randomly drawn ordered pair of sites (separated by a fixed shell) contains species $\\alpha$ on one site and species $\\beta$ on the other is $p_{\\alpha} p_{\\beta}$.

Use the weights $\\{w_1,w_2,w_3\\}$ to prioritize shells, and define the objective so that smaller values indicate better agreement with random mixing. Implement the objective precisely according to your derivation.\n\nYour program must:\n\n1. Use the $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ simple cubic supercell with $N=8$ periodic sites and the three shells defined by $d^2 \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$ using the minimal-image convention with supercell length $L=2$ along each axis.\n2. For each test case, produce integer site counts $\\{n_i\\}_{i=1}^{K}$ from the provided composition fractions $\\{p_i\\}$ by the largest remainder method applied to $N$: set $n_i = \\lfloor N p_i \\rfloor$, compute the residual $r_i = N p_i - \\lfloor N p_i \\rfloor$, and allocate the remaining $N - \\sum_i n_i$ sites by incrementing $n_i$ for the indices with largest $r_i$ until the total reaches $N$. Use the resulting supercell composition fractions $q_i = n_i / N$ in your random-mixing comparison.\n3. Enumerate all distinct assignments of cation species to the $N$ sites consistent with $\\{n_i\\}$ (i.e., all unique permutations of a multiset with counts $\\{n_i\\}$ under site labeling). For each assignment, compute the shell-resolved unordered pair fractions for all unordered species pairs, derive the quantitative objective described above from first principles, and keep the minimum objective value over all assignments as the SQS score for the test case.\n4.

            "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all necessary information for a unique solution is provided. It represents a standard, albeit simplified, computational problem in materials science. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution is presented below.\n\nThe core of the problem is to find a Special Quasirandom Structure (SQS), which is a specific atomic arrangement in a small supercell that best mimics the structural correlations of a perfectly random alloy. The quality of this mimicry is quantified by an objective function, which measures the deviation of the pair correlation functions in the candidate structure from their target values in an ideal random solution. The SQS for a given composition is the configuration that minimizes this objective function.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the SQS Objective Function\n\nThe objective function, which we seek to minimize, is a quantitative measure of the \"randomness\" of a given atomic configuration. It is constructed by comparing the pair statistics of the configuration to those of an ideal random alloy.\n\nLet there be $K$ species of cations. The composition of the alloy within the supercell is given by the set of fractions $\\{q_1, q_2, \\dots, q_K\\}$, where $q_\\alpha$ is the fraction of sites occupied by species $\\alpha$, and $\\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{K} q_\\alpha = 1$.\n\nIn an ideal random alloy of this composition, the probability of finding a specific species $\\alpha$ at any given site is $q_\\alpha$. The probability of finding an ordered pair of species $(\\alpha, \\beta)$ at two distinct sites is $q_\\alpha q_\\beta$. For an unordered pair, we must distinguish between two cases:\n1.  Homogeneous pair $(\\alpha, \\alpha)$: The probability is $\\Pi_{\\alpha\\alpha}^{\\text{random}} = q_\\alpha^2$.\n2.  Heterogeneous pair $(\\alpha, \\beta)$ with $\\alpha \\neq \\beta$: The probability is $\\Pi_{\\alpha\\beta}^{\\text{random}} = 2 q_\\alpha q_\\beta$, accounting for both $(\\alpha, \\beta)$ and $(\\beta, \\alpha)$ orderings.\nThis can be written compactly using the Kronecker delta, $\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}$, as $\\Pi_{\\alpha\\beta}^{\\text{random}} = (2-\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}) q_\\alpha q_\\beta$.\n\nFor any given configuration $\\sigma$ of the $N$ cations on the supercell lattice, we can measure the actual fraction of such pairs. The problem defines three neighbor shells, indexed by $m \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, corresponding to squared distances $d^2 \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. Let $N_m$ be the total number of site pairs in shell $m$. For a configuration $\\sigma$, let $N_{m, \\alpha\\beta}(\\sigma)$ be the count of an unordered pair of species $(\\alpha, \\beta)$ in shell $m$. The shell-resolved pair fraction is then:\n$$ \\Pi_{m, \\alpha\\beta}(\\sigma) = \\frac{N_{m, \\alpha\\beta}(\\sigma)}{N_m} $$\n\nThe mismatch between the configuration and the ideal random alloy for a specific shell $m$ and pair type $(\\alpha, \\beta)$ is the difference $\\Pi_{m, \\alpha\\beta}(\\sigma) - \\Pi_{\\alpha\\beta}^{\\text{random}}$. A robust objective function is formed by summing the squares of these differences over all distinct pair types and all shells, with each shell's contribution weighted by $w_m$. The objective function $\\mathcal{O}(\\sigma)$ for a configuration $\\sigma$ is thus:\n$$ \\mathcal{O}(\\sigma) = \\sum_{m=1}^{3} w_m \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{K} \\sum_{\\beta=\\alpha}^{K} \\left( \\Pi_{m, \\alpha\\beta}(\\sigma) - \\Pi_{\\alpha\\beta}^{\\text{random}} \\right)^2 $$\nThe goal is to find the configuration $\\sigma_{\\text{SQS}}$ that minimizes this value: $\\mathcal{O}_{\\text{SQS}} = \\min_{\\sigma} \\mathcal{O}(\\sigma)$.\n\n### Part 2: Supercell Geometry and Shell Structure\n\nThe system is a $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ simple cubic supercell containing $N=8$ sites. We can place these sites at coordinates $(x,y,z)$ where $x,y,z \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. The supercell has a lattice parameter of $a=1$ and periodic boundaries are applied with a supercell length of $L=2$. The squared distance $d^2$ between two sites $\\vec{r}_i$ and $\\vec{r}_j$ under the minimal image convention is calculated from the vector components $\\Delta x, \\Delta y, \\Delta z$, where each component distance is $\\min(|\\Delta x_k|, L - |\\Delta x_k|)$. For the chosen coordinates, site-to-site vector components are in $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, so the minimal image distance simplifies to the standard Euclidean distance.\n\nWe enumerate all $\\binom{8}{2} = 28$ unique pairs of sites to determine the shell structure:\n1.  **Shell 1 ($d^2 = 1$):** These are pairs of sites separated by a vector like $(1,0,0)$. These correspond to the edges of the cube. There are $12$ edges, so the total number of first-neighbor pairs is $N_1 = 12$.\n2.  **Shell 2 ($d^2 = 2$):** These are pairs of sites separated by a vector like $(1,1,0)$. These correspond to the face diagonals of the cube. There are $6$ faces, each with $2$ diagonals, so the total number of second-neighbor pairs is $N_2 = 12$.\n3.  **Shell 3 ($d^2 = 3$):** These are pairs of sites separated by a vector like $(1,1,1)$. These correspond to the $4$ space diagonals of the cube, so the total number of third-neighbor pairs is $N_3 = 4$.\n\nThe total number of pairs is $N_1 + N_2 + N_3 = 12 + 12 + 4 = 28$, which correctly accounts for all pairs in the supercell.\n\n### Part 3: Computational Algorithm\n\nThe SQS score for each test case is found by an exhaustive search over all possible unique configurations.\n\n**Step 1: Supercell Stoichiometry**\nThe problem requires deriving the integer counts $\\{n_1, \\dots, n_K\\}$ of each species in the $N=8$ site supercell from the given bulk compositions $\\{p_1, \\dots, p_K\\}$. This is done using the largest remainder method:\n- First, an initial allocation is made: $n'_\\alpha = \\lfloor N p_\\alpha \\rfloor$.\n- The number of remaining sites to be allocated is $N_{\\text{rem}} = N - \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{K} n'_\\alpha$.\n- The remainders are calculated: $r_\\alpha = N p_\\alpha - n'_\\alpha$.\n- The $N_{\\text{rem}}$ sites are assigned one by one to the species with the largest remainders. In case of ties in $r_\\alpha$, the site is assigned to the species with the lower index $\\alpha$.\n- The final counts are $\\{n_\\alpha\\}$, and the supercell composition used for the random-alloy target is $q_\\alpha = n_\\alpha / N$.\n\n**Step 2: Configuration Space Enumeration**\nGiven the species counts $\\{n_\\alpha\\}$, a base configuration is a multiset of $N=8$ species labels, e.g., `{A, A, B, ...}`. The set of all possible distinct structures is the set of unique permutations of this multiset. The size of this set is given by the multinomial coefficient $N! / (n_1! n_2! \\dots n_K!)$. For the small system size of $N=8$, this number is computationally manageable, allowing for a brute-force search.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluation and Minimization**\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1.  Pre-calculate the lists of site pairs $(i, j)$ for each of the three shells.\n2.  For a given test case, determine the species counts $\\{n_\\alpha\\}$ and supercell fractions $\\{q_\\alpha\\}$.\n3.  Calculate the target random-pair probabilities $\\Pi_{\\alpha\\beta}^{\\text{random}}$ for all unique unordered pairs $(\\alpha, \\beta)$.\n4.  Generate all unique permutations of the species multiset.\n5.  Initialize a minimum objective score to a large value.\n6.  For each unique permutation (configuration $\\sigma$):\n    a. Calculate the pair fractions $\\Pi_{m, \\alpha\\beta}(\\sigma)$ by iterating through the pre-calculated shell pair lists and counting the occurrences of each species pair type.\n    b. Compute the objective function $\\mathcal{O}(\\sigma)$ using the derived formula.\n    c. Update the minimum objective score if the current configuration's score is lower.\n7.  The final result for the test case is the minimum score found, rounded to six decimal places. For the trivial case of $K=1$, the configuration is fixed, all pair fractions are $1$, the target probability is $1$, and the objective is exactly $0.0$.",
