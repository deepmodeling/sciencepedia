            "problem": "Consider a high-entropy alloy grain boundary interface modeled as a two-dimensional lattice of $N_s$ independent adsorption sites per unit area that can be occupied by atoms of a single segregating species $i$. Each site can hold at most one atom of species $i$ (site blocking), and sites not occupied by species $i$ are effectively occupied by matrix atoms whose thermodynamic role is to define the empty reference state. The system is in equilibrium at temperature $T$ with a bulk reservoir of species $i$ characterized by chemical potential $\\mu_i$. The free energy change to occupy a boundary site with species $i$ (relative to the same atom remaining in the bulk and the boundary site remaining in its reference state) is $\\Delta g_i$, which is independent of coverage and temperature over the range of interest.

It is well-posed, providing sufficient information to derive a unique solution. The language is objective and precise.\n\nA point of potential ambiguity arises from the definition of $\\Delta g_i$. The phrase \"free energy change to occupy a boundary site with species $i$ (relative to the same atom remaining in the bulk...)\" could be interpreted as $\\epsilon_i - \\mu_i$, where $\\epsilon_i$ is the site energy. However, the problem also states that $\\Delta g_i$ is independent of coverage and temperature, whereas $\\mu_i$ is intrinsically dependent on the bulk state (composition) and temperature. This presents a seeming contradiction.\n\nThis ambiguity can be resolved by interpreting $\\Delta g_i$ not as the full driving force for segregation at a given $\\mu_i$, but as the intrinsic free energy of the site itself, relative to a zero-energy reference state for an empty site. In this framework, $\\Delta g_i$ represents the local, non-configurational free energy of an atom occupying an interface site. This quantity would be a material property, independent of the bulk reservoir's state, fitting the problem's description. The chemical potential of the bulk, $\\mu_i$, is the separate thermodynamic potential of the reservoir. The competition between these two quantities, $\\Delta g_i$ and $\\mu_i$, governs the site occupancy. This interpretation renders the problem self-consistent and solvable.\n\nThus, the problem is deemed valid under this physically sound interpretation.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A detailed solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the segregation isotherm for a single species $i$ adsorbing onto a lattice of independent sites. The system is open with respect to the number of adsorbed atoms, which are exchanged with a bulk reservoir at constant chemical potential $\\mu_i$ and temperature $T$. The grand canonical ensemble is the appropriate statistical framework.\n\nWe begin by considering a single adsorption site. This site can exist in two possible states:\n1.  Unoccupied (empty): In this state, the number of adsorbed $i$ atoms is $N = 0$. We define the energy of this reference state as $E_0 = 0$.\n2.  Occupied by an atom of species $i$: In this state, the number of adsorbed atoms is $N = 1$. The non-configurational free energy of an atom on this site is given as $\\Delta g_i$. We interpret this as the energy of the occupied state, $E_1 = \\Delta g_i$.\n\nThe grand partition function for this single site, $\\mathcal{Z}_1$, is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for each possible state:\n$$\n\\mathcal{Z}_1 = \\sum_{\\text{states } j} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_j - N_j \\mu_i}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the properties of our two states:\n$$\n\\mathcal{Z}_1 = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0 - 0 \\cdot \\mu_i}{k_B T}\\right) + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta g_i - 1 \\cdot \\mu_i}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mathcal{Z}_1 = 1 + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta g_i - \\mu_i}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nThe probability that the site is occupied by an atom of species $i$, which is equivalent to the fractional occupancy $\\theta_i$, is given by the ratio of the Boltzmann factor for the occupied state to the grand partition function of the site:\n$$\n\\theta_i = P(\\text{occupied}) = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta g_i - \\mu_i}{k_B T}\\right)}{\\mathcal{Z}_1} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta g_i - \\mu_i}{k_B T}\\right)}{1 + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta g_i - \\mu_i}{k_B T}\\right)}\n$$\nThis expression can be algebraically simplified by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta g_i - \\mu_i}{k_B T}\\right)$:\n$$\n\\theta_i = \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta g_i - \\mu_i}{k_B T}\\right) + 1}\n$$\nThis is the familiar form of the Fermi-Dirac distribution, which arises naturally for particles obeying an exclusion principle (site blocking).\n\nThe total number of adsorption sites per unit area is given as $N_s$. Since the sites are independent, the total number of occupied sites per unit area is the product of the total site density and the probability that any given site is occupied. The problem defines this quantity as the interfacial excess, $\\Gamma_i$.\n$$\n\\Gamma_i = N_s \\cdot \\theta_i\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $\\theta_i$:\n$$\n\\Gamma_i(\\mu_i) = N_s \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta g_i - \\mu_i}{k_B T}\\right)}\n$$\nThis expression gives the interfacial excess $\\Gamma_i$ as a function of the reservoir chemical potential $\\mu_i$, the segregation free energy $\\Delta g_i$, the temperature $T$, and the total site density $N_s$.\n\nWe verify the physical limits of this expression:\n1.  **High-activity limit (Saturation):** As the concentration of species $i$ in the bulk increases, its chemical potential $\\mu_i$ becomes very large ($\\mu_i \\to \\infty$). In this limit, the term $\\frac{\\Delta g_i - \\mu_i}{k_B T} \\to -\\infty$. Consequently, $\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta g_i - \\mu_i}{k_B T}\\right) \\to 0$. The expression for $\\Gamma_i$ becomes:\n    $$\n    \\Gamma_i \\to N_s \\frac{1}{1 + 0} = N_s\n    $$\n    The interface saturates, with all available sites being occupied, so $\\Gamma_i = N_s$. This matches the site blocking constraint.\n\n2.  **Low-activity limit (Henry's Law):** As the concentration of species $i$ in the bulk becomes very dilute, its chemical potential $\\mu_i$ becomes very small ($\\mu_i \\to -\\infty$). In this limit, the term $\\frac{\\Delta g_i - \\mu_i}{k_B T} \\to +\\infty$. Consequently, $\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta g_i - \\mu_i}{k_B T}\\right) \\gg 1$. The expression for $\\Gamma_i$ can be approximated as:\n    $$\n    \\Gamma_i \\approx N_s \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta g_i - \\mu_i}{k_B T}\\right)} = N_s \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta g_i - \\mu_i}{k_B T}\\right) = N_s \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta g_i}{k_B T}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\mu_i}{k_B T}\\right)\n    $$\n    For a dilute bulk solution, $\\mu_i \\approx \\mu_i^{\\circ} + k_B T \\ln X_i$, where $X_i$ is the mole fraction of $i$. Thus, $\\exp(\\mu_i/(k_B T)) \\propto X_i$. This shows that $\\Gamma_i$ is directly proportional to the bulk concentration $X_i$, which is the form of Henry's Law for adsorption.\n\nThe derived expression is consistent with all problem constraints and exhibits the correct physical behavior in both high- and low-activity limits.",

The thermodynamic relationship between interfacial free energy and interfacial excess entropy is a fundamental principle. The provided functional form for $\\gamma(T)$ is a physically plausible phenomenological model, combining a linear temperature dependence (a common approximation) with a hyperbolic tangent function to smoothly model a transition, which is standard practice in mean-field theories of phase transformations.\n-   **Well-Posed:** All necessary constants, parameters, and the explicit functional form of $\\gamma(T)$ are provided. The question asks for a specific, calculable quantity at a specific temperature. A unique and meaningful solution can be determined.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative terms without ambiguity or subjective content.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\n**Justification of the Thermodynamic Identity**\nIn interfacial thermodynamics, the interfacial free energy per unit area, $\\gamma$, is an excess Gibbs free energy. For a system with an interface of area $A$, the total Gibbs free energy $G$ contains a contribution from the interface, $G_{int} = \\gamma A$. The fundamental thermodynamic relation for the Gibbs free energy of the entire system (bulk phases $+$ interface) is:\n$$\ndG = -SdT + VdP + \\gamma dA + \\sum_{i} \\mu_i dn_i\n$$\nHere, $S$, $V$, $n_i$, and $\\mu_i$ represent the total entropy, volume, mole number of component $i$, and chemical potential of component $i$, respectively.\n\nThe Gibbs adsorption isotherm describes the change in interfacial free energy, $d\\gamma$. It can be derived from the Gibbs-Duhem equation applied to the interface. The result is:\n$$\nd\\gamma = -s_{int}dT + v_{int}dP - \\sum_{i} \\Gamma_i d\\mu_i\n$$\nwhere $s_{int}$ is the interfacial excess entropy per unit area, $v_{int}$ is the interfacial excess volume per unit area, and $\\Gamma_i$ is the interfacial excess concentration (adsorption) of species $i$ per unit area.\n\nThe problem specifies that the calculation is to be performed under conditions of fixed pressure ($dP = 0$) and fixed bulk composition. In a multi-component system at equilibrium, fixing the bulk composition and temperature at constant pressure also fixes the chemical potentials of all components, thus $d\\mu_i = 0$. Under these constraints, the Gibbs adsorption isotherm simplifies to:\n$$\nd\\gamma = -s_{int}dT\n$$\nFrom this, we directly obtain the thermodynamic identity for the interfacial excess entropy per unit area, which we will denote as $s_{GB}$ for the grain boundary:\n$$\ns_{GB} = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\gamma}{\\partial T}\\right)_{P, \\{\\mu_i\\}}\n$$\nThis is the identity that will be used for the calculation.\n\n**Calculation of Interfacial Excess Entropy**\nWe are given the function for the interfacial free energy:\n$$\n\\gamma(T) = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{ref}} - \\alpha T - \\frac{\\Delta\\gamma}{2}\\left[1 + \\tanh\\left(\\frac{T - T_{c}}{w}\\right)\\right]\n$$\nTo find the interfacial excess entropy, $s_{GB}(T)$, we must compute the negative derivative of $\\gamma(T)$ with respect to temperature $T$:\n$$\ns_{GB}(T) = -\\frac{d\\gamma}{dT} = -\\frac{d}{dT}\\left[ \\gamma_{\\mathrm{ref}} - \\alpha T - \\frac{\\Delta\\gamma}{2} - \\frac{\\Delta\\gamma}{2}\\tanh\\left(\\frac{T - T_{c}}{w}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nThe derivative of each term is computed. The derivatives of the constants $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ and $\\frac{\\Delta\\gamma}{2}$ are zero.\n$$\ns_{GB}(T) = - \\left( -\\alpha - \\frac{\\Delta\\gamma}{2} \\frac{d}{dT}\\left[\\tanh\\left(\\frac{T - T_{c}}{w}\\right)\\right] \\right)\n$$\nUsing the chain rule, and recalling that the derivative of $\\tanh(u)$ is $\\mathrm{sech}^2(u)$, where $u = \\frac{T - T_c}{w}$ and $\\frac{du}{dT} = \\frac{1}{w}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dT}\\left[\\tanh\\left(\\frac{T - T_{c}}{w}\\right)\\right] = \\mathrm{sech}^2\\left(\\frac{T - T_{c}}{w}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{w}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $s_{GB}(T)$:\n$$\ns_{GB}(T) = \\alpha + \\frac{\\Delta\\gamma}{2w} \\mathrm{sech}^2\\left(\\frac{T - T_{c}}{w}\\right)\n$$\nWe need to evaluate this expression at the complexion transition temperature, $T = T_c = 1150\\,\\mathrm{K}$. At this temperature, the argument of the hyperbolic secant function becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{T_c - T_c}{w} = \\frac{0}{w} = 0\n$$\nSince $\\cosh(0) = 1$, it follows that $\\mathrm{sech}(0) = 1/\\cosh(0) = 1$, and thus $\\mathrm{sech}^2(0) = 1^2 = 1$.\nThe expression for the entropy at $T = T_c$ simplifies to:\n$$\ns_{GB}(T_c) = \\alpha + \\frac{\\Delta\\gamma}{2w}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$\\alpha = 4.0\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n$\\Delta\\gamma = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$\n$w = 35\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n\n$$\ns_{GB}(1150\\,\\mathrm{K}) = (4.0 \\times 10^{-4}) + \\frac{0.10}{2 \\times 35}\n$$\n$$\ns_{GB}(1150\\,\\mathrm{K}) = 4.0 \\times 10^{-4} + \\frac{0.10}{70}\n$$\n$$\ns_{GB}(1150\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 0.0004 + 0.00142857...\n$$\n$$\ns_{GB}(1150\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 0.00182857... \\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.001829\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.\n\n**Discussion of Errors and Influence of the Parameter $w$**\n\n**Sources of Error:** The inferred value of $s_{GB}$ is subject to several sources of error.\n1.  **Experimental Errors:** The underlying data come from grain growth experiments. Errors in measuring average grain size via microscopy, statistical uncertainties, and imprecise temperature control can propagate into the fitted parameters of the $\\gamma(T)$ model. Furthermore, the kinetic model used to extract $\\gamma$ from grain size data often relies on idealizations (e.g., isotropic boundary properties, absence of solute drag or triple junction pinning) that are not perfectly met in complex alloys like HEAs.\n2.  **Modeling Errors:** The provided equation for $\\gamma(T)$ is a phenomenological model. The actual physical process may not conform exactly to a hyperbolic tangent profile. Most significantly, calculating entropy requires taking a derivative. Numerical differentiation of experimental data is an inherently noise-amplifying process. Even small amounts of scatter in the data for $\\gamma$ versus $T$ can lead to large uncertainties in its slope, $\\frac{d\\gamma}{dT}$, and thus in the derived entropy $s_{GB}$.\n\n**Influence of the Smoothening Parameter $w$:** The parameter $w$ defines the temperature width of the complexion transition. Its value has a critical influence on the calculated interfacial excess entropy, particularly at the transition temperature $T_c$. The entropy expression, $s_{GB}(T) = \\alpha + \\frac{\\Delta\\gamma}{2w} \\mathrm{sech}^2\\left(\\frac{T - T_{c}}{w}\\right)$, contains $w$ in the denominator of the transition-related term. This means the magnitude of the entropy *peak* at $T=T_c$ is inversely proportional to $w$: $s_{GB}(T_c) = \\alpha + \\frac{\\Delta\\gamma}{2w}$.\n-   A small value of $w$ corresponds to a very sharp, abrupt change in interfacial structure, approaching a first-order phase transition. This would produce a very large, sharp peak in the excess entropy at $T_c$. Consequently, the calculated value of $s_{GB}(T_c)$ becomes extremely sensitive to the fitted value of $w$. A small error in determining $w$ from noisy data would lead to a very large error in the peak entropy.\n-   A larger value of $w$, as used in this problem, represents a broad, gradual transition. This \"smoothening\" makes the derivative $\\frac{d\\gamma}{dT}$ smaller and less sharply peaked. As a result, the calculation of $s_{GB}$ is more robust against experimental noise and minor inaccuracies in locating the exact transition temperature $T_c$. The model with a finite $w$ effectively regularizes the problem, preventing the physically unrealistic scenario of an infinitely sharp entropy spike that would be implied by a true step-function discontinuity in $\\gamma(T)$.",
