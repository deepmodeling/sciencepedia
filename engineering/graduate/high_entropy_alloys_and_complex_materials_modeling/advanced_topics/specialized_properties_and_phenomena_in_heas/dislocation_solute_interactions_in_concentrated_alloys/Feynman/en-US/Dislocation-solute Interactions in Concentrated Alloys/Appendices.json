            "solution": "The problem as stated constitutes a valid, well-posed problem in the field of continuum mechanics applied to materials science, specifically dislocation theory. It is scientifically grounded, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the hydrostatic stress $\\sigma_{h}$ in the vicinity of a straight edge dislocation. The hydrostatic stress is defined as the arithmetic mean of the three normal stress components:\n$$\n\\sigma_{h} = \\frac{\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy} + \\sigma_{zz}}{3}\n$$\nThe analysis begins from the established stress field of a straight edge dislocation in an infinite, homogeneous, isotropic, linear-elastic solid. For a dislocation lying along the $z$-axis with a Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b} = b\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ and slip plane at $y=0$, the non-zero stress components in the $xy$-plane are given by the standard elasticity solution. These expressions are derived from an Airy stress function that satisfies the governing biharmonic equation of two-dimensional elasticity.\nThe Cartesian components of stress at a field point $(x, y)$ are:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx} = -\\frac{\\mu b}{2\\pi(1-\\nu)} \\frac{y(3x^2 + y^2)}{(x^2+y^2)^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{yy} = +\\frac{\\mu b}{2\\pi(1-\\nu)} \\frac{y(x^2 - y^2)}{(x^2+y^2)^2}\n$$\nHere, $\\mu$ is the shear modulus and $\\nu$ is the Poisson's ratio. The sign convention used here places the extra half-plane of atoms in the $y0$ region, resulting in compression ($\\sigma_{xx}  0$, and $\\sigma_{yy}  0$ near the $y$-axis) above the slip plane, which is consistent with the problem's specification.\n\nThe problem specifies a state of plane strain, characteristic of a long, straight defect. In plane strain, the strain component along the dislocation line, $\\epsilon_{zz}$, is zero. The constitutive relation (Hooke's Law) for an isotropic elastic material connects this strain to the stress components:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{zz} = \\frac{1}{E} \\left[ \\sigma_{zz} - \\nu (\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy}) \\right]\n$$\nwhere $E$ is the Young's modulus. By setting $\\epsilon_{zz} = 0$, we solve for the stress component $\\sigma_{zz}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{zz} = \\nu (\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy})\n$$\nThis demonstrates that even in a state of plane strain, a non-zero stress must exist in the out-of-plane direction to prevent any change in length along that axis.\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\sigma_{zz}$ into the definition of hydrostatic stress:\n$$\n\\sigma_h = \\frac{\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy} + \\nu(\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy})}{3} = \\frac{(1+\\nu)}{3} (\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy})\n$$\nThe next step is to calculate the sum of the in-plane normal stresses, $\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy} = \\frac{\\mu b}{2\\pi(1-\\nu)} \\left[ -\\frac{y(3x^2 + y^2)}{(x^2+y^2)^2} + \\frac{y(x^2 - y^2)}{(x^2+y^2)^2} \\right]\n$$\nCombining the terms over a common denominator:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy} = \\frac{\\mu b y}{2\\pi(1-\\nu)(x^2+y^2)^2} \\left[ -(3x^2 + y^2) + (x^2 - y^2) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy} = \\frac{\\mu b y}{2\\pi(1-\\nu)(x^2+y^2)^2} [-3x^2 - y^2 + x^2 - y^2]\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy} = \\frac{\\mu b y}{2\\pi(1-\\nu)(x^2+y^2)^2} [-2x^2 - 2y^2] = \\frac{\\mu b y}{2\\pi(1-\\nu)(x^2+y^2)^2} [-2(x^2 + y^2)]\n$$\nSimplifying the expression yields:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy} = -\\frac{2\\mu b y}{2\\pi(1-\\nu)(x^2+y^2)} = -\\frac{\\mu b y}{\\pi(1-\\nu)(x^2+y^2)}\n$$\nWe can now substitute this sum back into the expression for the hydrostatic stress $\\sigma_h$:\n$$\n\\sigma_h = \\frac{(1+\\nu)}{3} \\left( -\\frac{\\mu b y}{\\pi(1-\\nu)(x^2+y^2)} \\right) = - \\frac{\\mu b (1+\\nu) y}{3\\pi(1-\\nu)(x^2+y^2)}\n$$\nThe final step is to convert this expression from Cartesian coordinates $(x,y)$ to polar coordinates $(r,\\theta)$ using the standard transformations: $x = r \\cos\\theta$ and $y = r \\sin\\theta$, which gives $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$.\n$$\n\\sigma_h(r, \\theta) = - \\frac{\\mu b (1+\\nu) (r\\sin\\theta)}{3\\pi(1-\\nu)r^2}\n$$\nCanceling one factor of $r$ from the numerator and denominator gives the final result for the hydrostatic stress field around an edge dislocation:\n$$\n\\sigma_h(r, \\theta) = - \\frac{\\mu b (1+\\nu) \\sin\\theta}{3\\pi(1-\\nu) r}\n$$\nThis expression is fundamental to the study of dislocation-solute interactions.

This creates a compressive stress field in the region $\\theta \\in (0, \\pi)$ and a tensile stress field in the region $\\theta \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$ below the glide plane. An oversized solute atom ($\\Delta\\Omega  0$) introduces its own compressive strain. To minimize the total strain energy of the crystal, the solute atom is attracted to regions of tension (where there is more available volume) and repelled from regions of compression.\n- The strongest tension is directly below the dislocation core at $\\theta = 3\\pi/2$, hence this is the position of strongest attraction.\n- The strongest compression is directly above the dislocation core at $\\theta = \\pi/2$, hence this is the position of strongest repulsion.\nThis physical reasoning is perfectly consistent with our mathematical findings.\nThe final answer requested is only the analytic expression for $E(r,\\theta)$.",

The elastic restoring force, $F_e(L)$, of the dislocation line with tension $T$ and displacement $u$ scales as $F_e(L) \\sim T u / L$.\n\nThe derivation of the key length scale, the Larkin length $L_c$, proceeds by first determining the scaling of the dislocation's displacement $u(L)$ with length $L$. This is found by balancing a typical elastic restoring force with the pinning force causing the displacement: $F_e(L) \\sim F_p(L)$. However, the problem specifies a slightly different, but equivalent, path. It defines the Larkin length $L_c$ as the scale at which the typical displacement $u(L_c)$ becomes comparable to the transverse correlation length of the disorder, here taken as $\\xi$. This condition is expressed as $u(L_c) \\sim \\xi$. To find $L_c$, we start with the force balance $T u(L_c) / L_c \\sim F_p(L_c) \\sim \\sigma_f \\sqrt{L_c \\xi}$. Substituting $u(L_c) \\sim \\xi$ into this balance gives:\n$$\n\\frac{T \\xi}{L_c} \\sim \\sigma_f \\sqrt{L_c \\xi}\n$$\nRearranging to solve for $L_c$:\n$$\nT \\xi \\sim \\sigma_f L_c^{3/2} \\sqrt{\\xi}\n$$\n$$\nT \\sqrt{\\xi} \\sim \\sigma_f L_c^{3/2}\n$$\n$$\nL_c^{3/2} \\sim \\frac{T \\sqrt{\\xi}}{\\sigma_f}\n$$\nSquaring both sides yields $L_c^3 \\sim \\frac{T^2 \\xi}{\\sigma_f^2}$, which leads to the expression for the Larkin length:\n$$\nL_c = \\left( \\frac{T^2 \\xi}{\\sigma_f^2} \\right)^{1/3}\n$$\nThis is the characteristic length of a collectively pinned dislocation segment.\n\nNext, we derive the theoretical critical resolved shear stress, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{theory}}$, denoted as $\\tau_c$ in the derivation. The onset of motion (depinning) occurs when the driving force from an applied stress $\\tau_c$ balances the maximum pinning force. The driving force on a segment of length $L_c$ is the Peach-Koehler force, $F_{app} = \\tau_c b L_c$. The maximum pinning force on this scale is $F_p(L_c) \\sim \\sigma_f \\sqrt{L_c \\xi}$. Equating these forces gives the condition for the CRSS:\n$$\n\\tau_c b L_c \\sim \\sigma_f \\sqrt{L_c \\xi}\n$$\nSolving for $\\tau_c$:\n$$\n\\tau_c \\sim \\frac{\\sigma_f}{b L_c} \\sqrt{L_c \\xi} = \\frac{\\sigma_f}{b} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\xi}{L_c}}\n$$\nTo convert this scaling relation into an equation, we introduce a dimensionless prefactor $A$ that accounts for the geometric factors and numerical constants omitted in the scaling analysis. Thus, the theoretical CRSS is:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{theory}} = A \\cdot \\frac{\\sigma_f}{b} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\xi}{L_c}}\n$$\nThe task is to find a calibrated value of $A$ for each test case by setting $\\tau_{\\mathrm{theory}} = \\tau_{\\mathrm{meas}}$:\n$$\nA = \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{meas}}}{\\frac{\\sigma_f}{b} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\xi}{L_c}}}\n$$\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n1.  Determine the dislocation geometry factor $\\alpha$. For an edge dislocation, $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2(1-\\nu)}$. For a screw dislocation, $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n2.  Calculate the line tension $T$ using $T = \\alpha G b^2$.\n3.  Calculate the Larkin length $L_c = \\left( \\frac{T^2 \\xi}{\\sigma_f^2} \\right)^{1/3}$.\n4.  Substitute all values into the expression for $A$ to find the calibrated prefactor.\n\nWe now apply this procedure to each test case.\n\n**Case 1: General case, edge character**\n-   Given: $G = 80 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, $\\nu = 0.30$, $b = 2.5 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\sigma_f = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$, $\\xi = 3.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{meas}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.\n-   Step 1: $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2(1-0.30)} = \\frac{1}{1.4} \\approx 0.714286$.\n-   Step 2: $T = (\\frac{1}{1.4}) \\cdot (80 \\times 10^9) \\cdot (2.5 \\times 10^{-10})^2 \\approx 3.5714 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n-   Step 3: $L_c = \\left( \\frac{(3.5714 \\times 10^{-9})^2 \\cdot (3.0 \\times 10^{-9})}{(1.0 \\times 10^{-3})^2} \\right)^{1/3} \\approx 3.3695 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n-   Step 4: $A = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{6}}{(\\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}}{2.5 \\times 10^{-10}}) \\sqrt{\\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{-9}}{3.3695 \\times 10^{-7}}}} \\approx 2.649516$.\n\n**Case 2: Screw character, stronger disorder**\n-   Given: $G = 80 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, $\\nu = 0.30$, $b = 2.5 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\sigma_f = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$, $\\xi = 1.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{meas}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.\n-   Step 1: $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$.\n-   Step 2: $T = 0.5 \\cdot (80 \\times 10^9) \\cdot (2.5 \\times 10^{-10})^2 = 2.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n-   Step 3: $L_c = \\left( \\frac{(2.5 \\times 10^{-9})^2 \\cdot (1.0 \\times 10^{-9})}{(5.0 \\times 10^{-3})^2} \\right)^{1/3} \\approx 6.2996 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n-   Step 4: $A = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{7}}{(\\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{-3}}{2.5 \\times 10^{-10}}) \\sqrt{\\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-9}}{6.2996 \\times 10^{-8}}}} \\approx 3.968502$.\n\n**Case 3: Weak disorder limit, edge character**\n-   Given: $G = 80 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, $\\nu = 0.30$, $b = 2.5 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\sigma_f = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$, $\\xi = 1.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{meas}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.\n-   Step 1: $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2(1-0.30)} \\approx 0.714286$.\n-   Step 2: $T = (\\frac{1}{1.4}) \\cdot (80 \\times 10^9) \\cdot (2.5 \\times 10^{-10})^2 \\approx 3.5714 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n-   Step 3: $L_c = \\left( \\frac{(3.5714 \\times 10^{-9})^2 \\cdot (1.0 \\times 10^{-9})}{(1.0 \\times 10^{-6})^2} \\right)^{1/3} \\approx 2.3364 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n-   Step 4: $A = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{3}}{(\\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-6}}{2.5 \\times 10^{-10}}) \\sqrt{\\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-9}}{2.3364 \\times 10^{-5}}}} \\approx 38.214800$.\n\n**Case 4: Long correlation length, edge character**\n-   Given: $G = 80 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, $\\nu = 0.30$, $b = 2.5 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\sigma_f = 2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$, $\\xi = 3.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{meas}} = 4.0 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.\n-   Step 1: $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2(1-0.30)} \\approx 0.714286$.\n-   Step 2: $T = (\\frac{1}{1.4}) \\cdot (80 \\times 10^9) \\cdot (2.5 \\times 10^{-10})^2 \\approx 3.5714 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n-   Step 3: $L_c = \\left( \\frac{(3.5714 \\times 10^{-9})^2 \\cdot (3.0 \\times 10^{-8})}{(2.0 \\times 10^{-3})^2} \\right)^{1/3} \\approx 4.5735 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n-   Step 4: $A = \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{6}}{(\\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-3}}{2.5 \\times 10^{-10}}) \\sqrt{\\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{-8}}{4.5735 \\times 10^{-7}}}} \\approx 1.952173$.\n\nThese calculations are implemented in the following program to produce the final results.",
