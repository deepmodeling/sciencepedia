            "problem": "A High-Entropy Alloy (HEA) is a multicomponent metallic system with near-equiatomic concentrations of five or more principal elements; consider an equiatomic $\\text{CoCrFeNiAl}$ HEA. At high temperature, elements such as aluminum and chromium preferentially oxidize, forming scales like $\\text{Al}_2\\text{O}_3$ and $\\text{Cr}_2\\text{O}_3$. The Pilling–Bedworth ratio (PBR) is conceptually defined as the ratio of oxide volume formed to the volume of metal consumed to form that oxide. Starting from mass conservation and the core definition of molar volume $V = M/\\rho$ (where $M$ is molar mass and $\\rho$ is mass density), derive an analytical expression for the PBR for a general oxide $\\text{M}_a\\text{O}_b$ forming on its parent metal $\\text{M}$, and explain—based on mechanical compatibility and local stress generation—how the PBR magnitude predicts the likelihood of scale porosity or spallation versus adherence.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of materials science and corrosion, is well-posed with all necessary data and constraints provided, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We will proceed with the derivation, explanation, and calculation as requested.\n\nThe Pilling–Bedworth Ratio (PBR) is defined as the ratio of the volume of oxide formed ($V_{\\text{oxide}}$) to the volume of metal consumed ($V_{\\text{metal}}$) in the oxidation reaction:\n$$\n\\text{PBR} = \\frac{V_{\\text{oxide}}}{V_{\\text{metal}}}\n$$\nLet us derive a general analytical expression for an oxide of the form $\\text{M}_a\\text{O}_b$ forming on a pure metal $\\text{M}$. The balanced chemical reaction for the formation of the oxide can be written as:\n$$\na\\text{M} + \\frac{b}{2}\\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow \\text{M}_a\\text{O}_b\n$$\nThis stoichiometry indicates that to form $1$ mole of the oxide $\\text{M}_a\\text{O}_b$, $a$ moles of the metal $\\text{M}$ are consumed.\n\nThe volume of $1$ mole of oxide formed is its molar volume, $V_{m, \\text{oxide}}$. The volume of metal consumed to produce this amount of oxide is $a$ times the molar volume of the metal, $a \\cdot V_{m, \\text{metal}}$. Substituting these into the definition of PBR gives:\n$$\n\\text{PBR} = \\frac{V_{m, \\text{oxide}}}{a \\cdot V_{m, \\text{metal}}}\n$$\nMolar volume ($V_m$) is related to molar mass ($M$) and mass density ($\\rho$) by the equation $V_m = M/\\rho$. We can express the molar volumes of the oxide and the metal as:\n$$\nV_{m, \\text{oxide}} = \\frac{M_{\\text{M}_a\\text{O}_b}}{\\rho_{\\text{M}_a\\text{O}_b}}\n\\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad\nV_{m, \\text{metal}} = \\frac{M_{\\text{M}}}{\\rho_{\\text{M}}}\n$$\nHere, $M_{\\text{M}_a\\text{O}_b}$ and $\\rho_{\\text{M}_a\\text{O}_b}$ are the molar mass and density of the oxide, respectively, and $M_{\\text{M}}$ and $\\rho_{\\text{M}}$ are the molar mass and density of the metal.\n\nSubstituting these expressions back into the equation for the PBR, we obtain the general analytical expression:\n$$\n\\text{PBR} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{M_{\\text{M}_a\\text{O}_b}}{\\rho_{\\text{M}_a\\text{O}_b}} \\right)}{a \\cdot \\left( \\frac{M_{\\text{M}}}{\\rho_{\\text{M}}} \\right)} = \\frac{M_{\\text{M}_a\\text{O}_b} \\cdot \\rho_{\\text{M}}}{a \\cdot M_{\\text{M}} \\cdot \\rho_{\\text{M}_a\\text{O}_b}}\n$$\nwhere the molar mass of the oxide is $M_{\\text{M}_a\\text{O}_b} = a \\cdot M_{\\text{M}} + b \\cdot M_{\\text{O}}$, with $M_{\\text{O}}$ being the molar mass of oxygen.\n\nThe magnitude of the PBR is a critical indicator of the mechanical integrity and protective quality of the oxide scale.\n- If $\\text{PBR}  1$, the volume of the oxide is insufficient to cover the surface of the metal from which it formed. This creates tensile stresses in the oxide layer, leading to a porous, cracked, and non-protective scale that offers poor resistance to further oxidation.\n- If $\\text{PBR}  1$, the oxide volume is greater than the consumed metal volume, leading to the development of compressive stresses within the scale.\n    - For values moderately above unity, typically in the range $1  \\text{PBR}  2$, the compressive stresses are generally manageable. They can be accommodated by plastic deformation in the oxide or the substrate, resulting in a dense, adherent, and protective layer that effectively passivates the metal surface.\n    - For large values, typically $\\text{PBR}  2$ or $2.5$, the induced compressive stresses are severe. These high stresses can lead to mechanical failure of the oxide layer through buckling, cracking, and spallation (flaking off), exposing the underlying metal to the corrosive environment and compromising its protective function.\n\nNow, we compute the PBR for the formation of $\\text{Al}_2\\text{O}_3$ and $\\text{Cr}_2\\text{O}_3$ on the $\\text{CoCrFeNiAl}$ alloy. The problem specifies using the ideal solution approximation, which means the partial molar volume of an element in the alloy is approximated by the molar volume of the pure element. Therefore, for the 'metal consumed' term, we use the density of pure $\\text{Al}$ or pure $\\text{Cr}$.\n\nFor the formation of $\\text{Al}_2\\text{O}_3$:\nThe oxide is $\\text{Al}_2\\text{O}_3$, so the parent metal $\\text{M}$ is $\\text{Al}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the acceptor density $N_{A}$ in a p-type semiconductor passive film from the measured slope of a $C^{-2}$ versus $E$ plot. The derivation must begin from fundamental electrostatic principles.\n\nFirst, we model the passive film as a p-type semiconductor. During anodic polarization into the passive region, a depletion layer is formed at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. In the depletion approximation for a p-type material, mobile positive charge carriers (holes) are driven away from the interface, leaving behind a space-charge region of width $W$. This region contains a fixed negative charge density due to ionized acceptors. The charge density $\\rho$ as a function of distance $x$ from the interface is given by:\n$$ \\rho(x) = \\begin{cases} -q N_{A}  \\text{for } 0 \\le x \\le W \\\\ 0  \\text{for } x  W \\end{cases} $$\nwhere $q$ is the elementary charge and $N_{A}$ is the acceptor density.\n\nThe relationship between the electric potential $\\phi(x)$ and the charge density $\\rho(x)$ is governed by Poisson's equation in one dimension:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^{2}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}x^{2}} = -\\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\varepsilon} $$\nwhere $\\varepsilon$ is the absolute permittivity of the semiconductor material.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\rho(x)$ into Poisson's equation for the depletion region ($0 \\le x \\le W$):\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^{2}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}x^{2}} = -\\frac{-q N_{A}}{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{q N_{A}}{\\varepsilon} $$\nTo find the electric field, $\\mathcal{E}(x) = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}x}$, we integrate once with respect to $x$:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}x} = \\int \\frac{q N_{A}}{\\varepsilon} \\mathrm{d}x = \\frac{q N_{A}}{\\varepsilon} x + C_1 $$\nWe apply the boundary condition that the electric field is zero at the edge of the depletion region, i.e., $\\mathcal{E}(W) = 0$.\n$$ \\mathcal{E}(W) = -\\left( \\frac{q N_{A}}{\\varepsilon} W + C_1 \\right) = 0 \\implies C_1 = -\\frac{q N_{A}}{\\varepsilon} W $$\nSo the electric field within the depletion region is:\n$$ \\mathcal{E}(x) = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}x} = -\\frac{q N_{A}}{\\varepsilon}(x - W) = \\frac{q N_{A}}{\\varepsilon}(W - x) $$\nTo find the potential $\\phi(x)$, we integrate again:\n$$ \\phi(x) = -\\int \\frac{q N_{A}}{\\varepsilon}(x-W) \\mathrm{d}x = -\\frac{q N_{A}}{\\varepsilon}\\left(\\frac{x^2}{2} - Wx\\right) + C_2 $$\nLet's set the reference potential in the neutral bulk of the semiconductor ($x \\ge W$) to zero, i.e., $\\phi(W) = 0$.\n$$ \\phi(W) = -\\frac{q N_{A}}{\\varepsilon}\\left(\\frac{W^2}{2} - W^2\\right) + C_2 = \\frac{q N_{A} W^2}{2\\varepsilon} + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2 = -\\frac{q N_{A} W^2}{2\\varepsilon} $$\nThus, the potential profile within the depletion region is:\n$$ \\phi(x) = -\\frac{q N_{A}}{\\varepsilon}\\left(\\frac{x^2}{2} - Wx - \\frac{W^2}{2}\\right) = \\frac{q N_{A}}{2\\varepsilon}(2Wx - x^2 - W^2) = -\\frac{q N_{A}}{2\\varepsilon}(W-x)^2 $$\nThe total potential drop across the space-charge region, $V_{sc}$, is the difference between the potential at the interface ($x=0$) and in the bulk ($x=W$):\n$$ V_{sc} = \\phi(0) - \\phi(W) = -\\frac{q N_{A} W^2}{2\\varepsilon} - 0 = -\\frac{q N_{A} W^2}{2\\varepsilon} $$\nThis potential drop $V_{sc}$ is related to the applied electrode potential $E$ and the flat-band potential $E_{fb}$. For a p-type semiconductor, depletion occurs at potentials negative to $E_{fb}$ (upward band bending). The potential drop across the space charge region is $V_{sc} = E - E_{fb}$, assuming changes in applied potential are dropped entirely across this region.\n$$ E - E_{fb} = -\\frac{q N_{A} W^2}{2\\varepsilon} $$\nFrom this, we can express the depletion width $W$ as:\n$$ W = \\sqrt{-\\frac{2\\varepsilon(E - E_{fb})}{q N_{A}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\varepsilon(E_{fb} - E)}{q N_{A}}} $$\nThe space-charge region acts like a parallel-plate capacitor where the depletion width $W$ is the distance between the \"plates\".

A plot of $(C'_{sc})^{-2}$ versus $E$ is linear. The slope, which we call $m'$, is:\n$$ m' = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}E}\\left(\\frac{1}{(C'_{sc})^2}\\right) = -\\frac{2}{\\varepsilon q N_{A}} $$\nThe problem provides the experimentally measured total capacitance $C$ for an electrode of finite area $A$. The relationship between the total capacitance and the capacitance per unit area is $C = C'_{sc} \\cdot A$. Therefore, $C'_{sc} = C/A$. Substituting this into the Mott-Schottky equation:\n$$ \\frac{1}{(C/A)^2} = \\frac{A^2}{C^2} = -\\frac{2}{\\varepsilon q N_{A}} E + \\frac{2 E_{fb}}{\\varepsilon q N_{A}} $$\n$$ C^{-2} = \\left(-\\frac{2}{A^2 \\varepsilon q N_{A}}\\right) E + \\frac{2 E_{fb}}{A^2 \\varepsilon q N_{A}} $$\nThe slope of the experimental plot of $C^{-2}$ versus $E$, denoted as $m_{exp}$, is therefore:\n$$ m_{exp} = -\\frac{2}{A^2 \\varepsilon q N_{A}} $$\nAs stated in the problem, the slope is negative, which is the signature of a p-type semiconductor.

            "solution": "The solution requires the implementation of a computational framework to perform a multi-objective optimization for HEA compositions based on the provided physical models and constraints. The overall algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Candidate Composition Generation:** First, the program must enumerate all valid candidate compositions that adhere to the problem's constraints. The rules specify a quinary system (Al-Cr-Ni-Co-Fe) with concentrations in increments of 0.25, summing to 1. Furthermore, only HEA-like candidates with at least four non-zero components and a maximum single-element concentration of 0.5 are considered. A systematic search reveals that the only compositions satisfying all these criteria are the five possible quaternary equiatomic alloys, each having four components at 0.25 and one at 0.\n\n2.  **Physical Property Calculation:** For each candidate composition and a given temperature, a set of functions calculates the key performance metrics:\n    *   **Pilling-Bedworth Ratio ($\\mathrm{PBR}^{\\mathrm{eff}}$):** The individual PBR for each element is pre-calculated as a constant. The effective PBR for an alloy composition is then computed as a simple weighted average based on the elemental mole fractions.\n    *   **Parabolic Rate Constant ($k_p^{\\mathrm{eff}}$):** The species-specific rate constants ($k_i$) are calculated using the Arrhenius equation for the given temperature. The effective rate constant for the alloy is then determined using the specified harmonic mean of the individual constants, weighted by composition.\n    *   **Yield Strength ($\\sigma_y$):** The yield strength is estimated by first calculating the temperature-dependent shear modulus and baseline strength. Then, the average atomic radius and elemental size misfits are computed for the specific composition. These are used to calculate the solid-solution strengthening contribution, which is added to the baseline strength to obtain the final $\\sigma_y$.\n\n3.  **Optimization and Analysis:** For each test case (a specific temperature $T$ and weight vector $\\mathbf{w}$):\n    *   **Scalar Cost Minimization:** The scalar cost function $J$ is evaluated for all five candidate compositions. This involves computing the normalized parabolic constant, the PBR penalty term, and the normalized inverse yield strength, and then combining them using the given weights. The composition that results in the minimum $J$ value is identified as the optimal one for that test case.\n    *   **Pareto-Optimality:** Separately, a three-component objective vector $\\mathbf{f}(T,\\mathbf{c}) = ( k_p^{\\mathrm{eff}}, |\\mathrm{PBR}^{\\mathrm{eff}} - 1.5|, -\\sigma_y )$ is computed for each composition. The set of all five compositions is then analyzed to find the Pareto front. A composition is part of this set if no other candidate is better in at least one objective without being worse in any of the others. The number of compositions on the Pareto front is counted.\n\n4.  **Output Generation:** The final step involves formatting the results for each test case—the minimum scalar cost, the count of Pareto-optimal compositions, and the best composition vector from the scalar cost minimization—into the specified nested list format for output.",
