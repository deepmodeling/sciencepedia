The change in the Gibbs free energy, $\\Delta G$, upon introducing $n_v$ vacancies into a crystal with $N$ lattice sites can be expressed as the sum of the energy required to form the vacancies and the change in the entropy of the system.\n\nThe total change in Gibbs free energy, $\\Delta G_{total}$, has two components:\n$1$. The free energy of formation for $n_v$ non-interacting vacancies. The formation free energy of a single vacancy is $g_f = E_f - TS_f$, where $E_f$ is the vacancy formation energy and $S_f$ is the non-configurational (e.g., vibrational) vacancy formation entropy. For $n_v$ vacancies, this contribution is $n_v g_f = n_v (E_f - TS_f)$.\n$2$. The configurational entropy contribution. The number of ways to arrange $n_v$ vacancies on $N$ lattice sites is given by the binomial coefficient $\\Omega = \\binom{N}{n_v} = \\frac{N!}{n_v!(N-n_v)!}$. According to Boltzmann's principle, the configurational entropy is $S_{config} = k_B \\ln \\Omega$. The corresponding free energy term is $-T S_{config} = -k_B T \\ln \\Omega$.\n\nCombining these terms, the total change in Gibbs free energy is:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{total}(n_v, T) = n_v(E_f - TS_f) - k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{N!}{n_v!(N-n_v)!}\\right)\n$$\nTo find the equilibrium number of vacancies, we minimize $\\Delta G_{total}$ with respect to $n_v$ by setting the derivative to zero: $\\frac{\\partial (\\Delta G_{total})}{\\partial n_v} = 0$.\n\nWe use Stirling's approximation for the factorial terms, $\\ln(x!) \\approx x \\ln x - x$, which is valid for large $x$:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{N!}{n_v!(N-n_v)!}\\right) \\approx (N\\ln N - N) - (n_v\\ln n_v - n_v) - ((N-n_v)\\ln(N-n_v) - (N-n_v))\n$$\n$$\n\\ln \\Omega \\approx N\\ln N - n_v\\ln n_v - (N-n_v)\\ln(N-n_v)\n$$\nNow, we differentiate $\\Delta G_{total}$ with respect to $n_v$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial (\\Delta G_{total})}{\\partial n_v} = (E_f - TS_f) - k_B T \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n_v} \\left[ N\\ln N - n_v\\ln n_v - (N-n_v)\\ln(N-n_v) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial (\\Delta G_{total})}{\\partial n_v} = (E_f - TS_f) - k_B T \\left[ -(\\ln n_v + 1) - \\left( (-1)\\ln(N-n_v) + (N-n_v)\\frac{-1}{N-n_v} \\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial (\\Delta G_{total})}{\\partial n_v} = (E_f - TS_f) - k_B T \\left[ -\\ln n_v - 1 + \\ln(N-n_v) + 1 \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial (\\Delta G_{total})}{\\partial n_v} = (E_f - TS_f) + k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{n_v}{N-n_v}\\right)\n$$\nSetting this derivative to zero for equilibrium:\n$$\nE_f - TS_f + k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{n_v}{N-n_v}\\right) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{n_v}{N-n_v}\\right) = -\\frac{E_f - TS_f}{k_B T}\n$$\nThe fraction of vacancies is $c_v = \\frac{n_v}{N}$.

The problem states that creep is dominated by dislocation climb, which is rate-limited by vacancy availability. Dislocation climb is a process of mass transport to or from the dislocation line, which occurs via vacancy diffusion. The rate of such processes is typically proportional to the concentration of vacancies, $c_v$, and a vacancy diffusion term. Since the creep rate, $\\dot{\\epsilon}$, is limited by climb, it must be proportional to the climb velocity, which in turn is proportional to $c_v$. Therefore, $\\dot{\\epsilon} \\propto c_v$. The calculated ratio $R \\approx 125.9$ means that the equilibrium vacancy concentration is approximately $126$ times greater at $T_2 = 1200\\ \\text{K}$ than at $T_1 = 900\\ \\text{K}$. This dramatic increase in the concentration of available vacancies will lead to a correspondingly large increase in the rate of dislocation climb, and thus a substantial acceleration of the overall creep rate at the higher temperature. This highlights the strong, non-linear temperature dependence of high-temperature creep.",

Mechanism maps are constructed from steady-state creep rates predicted by two dominant high-temperature mechanisms: grain-boundary diffusion creep (Coble creep) and climb-controlled dislocation power-law creep. The boundary between these two mechanisms on the stress axis at fixed $T$ and $d$ is defined by the condition that their steady-state strain rates are equal. Assume that climb-controlled dislocation creep has a stress exponent $n=4$ at the given conditions and that its kinetics are controlled by lattice diffusion with coefficient $D_{L}$, while Coble creep is controlled by grain-boundary diffusion with coefficient $D_{gb}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires a derivation of the parametric dependence of the Coble creep / power-law creep mechanism boundary stress on the lattice diffusion coefficient, $D_L$, and the subsequent calculation of the change in this boundary stress due to a specified reduction in $D_L$. The validation process confirms that the problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\nThe starting point is the definition of the mechanism boundary: the stress, $\\sigma$, at which the steady-state strain rates of the two competing mechanisms are equal. The two mechanisms are climb-controlled dislocation power-law creep ($\\dot{\\epsilon}_{PLC}$) and grain-boundary diffusion creep, known as Coble creep ($\\dot{\\epsilon}_{Coble}$).\n\nThe first-principles origin of these creep equations lies in fundamental transport and force-balance relations.\n\nFor climb-controlled dislocation creep, the macroscopic strain rate is given by the Orowan equation, $\\dot{\\epsilon} = \\rho_m b v_d$, where $\\rho_m$ is the mobile dislocation density, $b$ is the magnitude of the Burgers vector, and $v_d$ is the average dislocation velocity. In climb-controlled creep, the dislocation velocity is limited by the rate at which dislocations can climb over obstacles. This climb process is mediated by the diffusion of vacancies to or from the dislocation line. The driving force for this diffusion is the stress-induced chemical potential gradient for vacancies. From Fick's first law, the vacancy flux is proportional to the lattice diffusion coefficient, $D_L$. Consequently, the climb velocity and thus the strain rate are directly proportional to $D_L$. The stress dependence arises from the influence of stress on both the dislocation density and the driving force for climb. The resulting expression for the steady-state strain rate is:\n$$\n\\dot{\\epsilon}_{PLC} = A_{PLC} \\frac{D_L G b}{k_B T} \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{G}\\right)^n\n$$\nwhere $A_{PLC}$ is a dimensionless material constant, $G$ is the shear modulus, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The problem specifies a stress exponent $n=4$.\n\nFor Coble creep, the strain is accommodated by the stress-directed diffusional flow of atoms along grain boundaries. The applied stress, $\\sigma$, creates a difference in chemical potential of vacancies between grain boundaries under tension and those under compression, on the order of $\\sigma \\Omega$, where $\\Omega$ is the atomic volume. This gradient drives a vacancy flux, described by Fick's law, with a diffusion path length related to the grain size, $d$. The relevant diffusion coefficient is that of the grain boundaries, $D_{gb}$. The resulting steady-state strain rate is given by:\n$$\n\\dot{\\epsilon}_{Coble} = A_{Coble} \\frac{D_{gb} \\delta \\Omega}{d^3 k_B T} \\sigma\n$$\nwhere $A_{Coble}$ is a dimensionless geometric constant and $\\delta$ is the effective width of the grain boundary for diffusion.\n\nThe boundary stress, which we denote as $\\sigma_{b}$, is found by equating the two strain rates, $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{PLC} = \\dot{\\epsilon}_{Coble}$:\n$$\nA_{PLC} \\frac{D_L G b}{k_B T} \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_b}{G}\\right)^4 = A_{Coble} \\frac{D_{gb} \\delta \\Omega}{d^3 k_B T} \\sigma_b\n$$\n\nThe term $k_B T$ cancels from both sides.

Nabarro-Herring creep is a process of stress-directed diffusion of vacancies (or, equivalently, atoms) through the crystal lattice.\n\n$1$. **Stress-Induced Chemical Potential Gradient**: Under an applied uniaxial tensile stress $\\sigma$, grain boundaries oriented perpendicular to the stress axis are placed in tension, while those parallel to the axis are in compression. The chemical potential of a vacancy, $\\mu_{v}$, is altered by the local normal stress, $\\sigma_{n}$, according to $\\mu_{v} = \\mu_{v,0} - \\sigma_{n}\\Omega$, where $\\mu_{v,0}$ is the reference chemical potential in a stress-free state and $\\Omega$ is the atomic volume. This creates a chemical potential difference for vacancies between boundaries under tension (high $\\mu_{v}$) and those under compression (low $\\mu_{v}$). The maximum difference in chemical potential across a grain of size $d(t)$ is approximately $\\Delta\\mu_{v} \\approx \\sigma\\Omega$. This difference establishes a chemical potential gradient, $\\nabla\\mu_{v}$, which drives the diffusion of vacancies. The magnitude of this gradient is approximated as:\n$$ |\\nabla\\mu_{v}| \\approx \\frac{\\Delta\\mu_{v}}{d(t)} \\approx \\frac{\\sigma\\Omega}{d(t)} $$\n\n$2$. **Diffusive Flux**: The flux of vacancies, $J_{v}$, is linearly related to the chemical potential gradient via the Nernst-Einstein relation:\n$$ J_{v} = -M_{v} \\nabla\\mu_{v} $$\nwhere $M_{v}$ is the vacancy mobility. The mobility is related to the vacancy diffusivity, $D_{v}$, and thermal energy, $k_{B}T$, by $M_{v}=C_{v}D_{v}/(k_{B}T)$, where $C_{v}$ is the vacancy concentration. In the context of self-diffusion, the lattice self-diffusivity, $D_{L}$, is given by $D_{L} \\approx C_{v,\\mathrm{eq}}\\Omega D_{v}$, where $C_{v,\\mathrm{eq}}$ is the equilibrium vacancy concentration per unit volume. The mobility can thus be expressed in terms of the directly measurable lattice self-diffusivity $D_{L}$ as $M_{v} \\approx D_{L}/(k_{B}T\\Omega)$. Substituting this and the gradient into the flux equation, the magnitude of the vacancy flux is:\n$$ |J_{v}| \\approx \\frac{D_{L}}{k_{B}T\\Omega} |\\nabla\\mu_{v}| \\approx \\frac{D_{L}}{k_{B}T\\Omega} \\frac{\\sigma\\Omega}{d(t)} = \\frac{D_{L}\\sigma}{k_{B}Td(t)} $$\n\n$3$. **Conservation of Matter and Strain Rate**: The net flux of vacancies away from boundaries in tension and towards boundaries in compression results in a flux of atoms in the opposite direction, causing the grain to elongate along the tensile axis. The volumetric rate of material added to a tensile grain boundary is the number of atoms arriving per second multiplied by the atomic volume. The number of atoms arriving at a boundary of area $\\sim d(t)^{2}$ is $|J_{a}|d(t)^{2}$, where $|J_{a}|=|J_{v}|$. The rate of volume addition to the grain along the tensile direction is $\\dot{V} = |J_{a}|d(t)^{2}\\Omega = |J_{v}|d(t)^{2}\\Omega$.\nThe elongation rate of the grain, $\\dot{\\delta}$, is this volume rate divided by the area over which it is deposited, $d(t)^{2}$:\n$$ \\dot{\\delta} = \\frac{\\dot{V}}{d(t)^{2}} = |J_{v}|\\Omega = \\left(\\frac{D_{L}\\sigma}{k_{B}Td(t)}\\right)\\Omega = \\frac{D_{L}\\sigma\\Omega}{k_{B}Td(t)} $$\nThe macroscopic engineering strain rate, $\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{diff}}$, is the average elongation rate of a grain divided by its length, $d(t)$:\n$$ \\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{diff}}(t) = \\frac{\\dot{\\delta}}{d(t)} = \\frac{1}{d(t)}\\left(\\frac{D_{L}\\sigma\\Omega}{k_{B}Td(t)}\\right) = \\frac{D_{L}\\sigma\\Omega}{k_{B}T d(t)^{2}} $$\nIntroducing a dimensionless geometric constant $A$ (typically $\\approx 10$) to account for the detailed polycrystal geometry, the full Nabarro-Herring creep equation is:\n$$ \\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{diff}}(t) = A\\frac{D_{L}\\sigma\\Omega}{k_{B}T}\\frac{1}{d(t)^{2}} $$\nSince $\\sigma$, $T$, $D_{L}$, $\\Omega$, $k_B$, and $A$ are all constants for a given test, we can define a composite constant $C = A D_{L}\\sigma\\Omega / (k_{B}T)$. The strain rate is then:\n$$ \\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{diff}}(t) = \\frac{C}{d(t)^{2}} $$\nThis derivation demonstrates that for Nabarro-Herring creep, the instantaneous strain rate is inversely proportional to the square of the instantaneous grain size, $\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{diff}}(t) \\propto d(t)^{-2}$. The time dependence arises solely through $d(t)$.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Strain Ratio $\\mathcal{R}$**\n\nGiven the grain growth law $d(t)^{m}-d_{0}^{m}=K\\,t$ with the exponent $m=2$, we have:\n$$ d(t)^{2} - d_{0}^{2} = K\\,t \\implies d(t)^{2} = d_{0}^{2} + K\\,t $$\nSubstituting this expression for $d(t)^{2}$ into the strain rate equation from Part 1 gives the time-dependent strain rate:\n$$ \\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{diff}}(t) = \\frac{C}{d_{0}^{2} + K\\,t} $$\nNow we can compute the total accumulated strains, $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{evo}}$ and $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{fix}}$.\n\nFor the case with evolving grain size, $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{evo}}$ is the time integral of $\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{diff}}(t)$ from $t=0$ to $t=t_{f}$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{evo}} = \\int_{0}^{t_{f}} \\frac{C}{d_{0}^{2} + K\\,t} \\,\\mathrm{d}t $$\nThis integral evaluates to:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{evo}} = C \\left[ \\frac{1}{K}\\ln(d_{0}^{2} + K\\,t) \\right]_{0}^{t_{f}} = \\frac{C}{K} \\left( \\ln(d_{0}^{2} + K\\,t_{f}) - \\ln(d_{0}^{2}) \\right) $$\nUsing logarithm properties, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{evo}} = \\frac{C}{K} \\ln\\left(\\frac{d_{0}^{2} + K\\,t_{f}}{d_{0}^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{C}{K} \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{K\\,t_{f}}{d_{0}^{2}}\\right) $$\nFor the comparative case with a fixed grain size $d=d_{0}$, the strain rate is constant:\n$$ \\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{diff}}(d=d_{0}) = \\frac{C}{d_{0}^{2}} $$\nThe total accumulated strain, $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{fix}}$, is this constant rate multiplied by the test duration $t_{f}$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{fix}} = \\int_{0}^{t_{f}} \\frac{C}{d_{0}^{2}} \\,\\mathrm{d}t = \\frac{C}{d_{0}^{2}} t_{f} $$\nThe ratio $\\mathcal{R}$ is $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{evo}}/\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{fix}}$:\n$$ \\mathcal{R} = \\frac{\\frac{C}{K} \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{K\\,t_{f}}{d_{0}^{2}}\\right)}{\\frac{C\\,t_{f}}{d_{0}^{2}}} $$\nThe constant $C$ cancels, yielding the final closed-form expression for $\\mathcal{R}$:\n$$ \\mathcal{R} = \\frac{d_{0}^{2}}{K\\,t_{f}} \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{K\\,t_{f}}{d_{0}^{2}}\\right) $$\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Evaluation of $\\mathcal{R}$**\n\nWe are given the following parameters:\n- $d_{0} = 2.0~\\mu\\text{m} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-6}~\\text{m}$\n- $K = 1.0 \\times 10^{-17}~\\text{m}^{2}\\text{/s}$\n- $t_{f} = 100~\\text{h}$\n\nFirst, convert the test duration $t_{f}$ to seconds:\n$$ t_{f} = 100~\\text{h} \\times 3600~\\text{s/h} = 3.6 \\times 10^{5}~\\text{s} $$\nNext, calculate the dimensionless parameter $\\chi = \\frac{K\\,t_{f}}{d_{0}^{2}}$:\n$$ d_{0}^{2} = (2.0 \\times 10^{-6}~\\text{m})^{2} = 4.0 \\times 10^{-12}~\\text{m}^{2} $$\n$$ K\\,t_{f} = (1.0 \\times 10^{-17}~\\text{m}^{2}\\text{/s}) \\times (3.6 \\times 10^{5}~\\text{s}) = 3.6 \\times 10^{-12}~\\text{m}^{2} $$\n$$ \\chi = \\frac{3.6 \\times 10^{-12}~\\text{m}^{2}}{4.0 \\times 10^{-12}~\\text{m}^{2}} = 0.9 $$\nThe expression for $\\mathcal{R}$ can be written in terms of $\\chi$ as $\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{1}{\\chi}\\ln(1+\\chi)$. Substituting the value of $\\chi$:\n$$ \\mathcal{R} = \\frac{1}{0.9} \\ln(1 + 0.9) = \\frac{1}{0.9} \\ln(1.9) $$\nUsing a calculator for the natural logarithm:\n$$ \\ln(1.9) \\approx 0.641853886 $$\n$$ \\mathcal{R} \\approx \\frac{0.641853886}{0.9} \\approx 0.713170984 $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as required:\n$$ \\mathcal{R} \\approx 0.7132 $$\nThe result, being less than $1$, is physically sensible, as grain growth reduces the creep rate over time, leading to a smaller total strain compared to the case where the grain size remains fixed at its smaller initial value.",
