We denote this average value as $\\bar{K}$:\n$$\n\\bar{K} = \\langle K_i \\rangle = \\exp\\left(\\mu + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)\n$$\nThe second term involves the orientational average $\\left\\langle 1 - (\\mathbf{m} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_i)^2 \\right\\rangle_{\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_i} = 1 - \\left\\langle (\\mathbf{m} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_i)^2 \\right\\rangle_{\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_i}$. To evaluate this, we define a coordinate system. Let the sample's primary symmetry axis be the $z$-axis, with a corresponding unit vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_z$. The uniform magnetization vector $\\mathbf{m}$ is a unit vector that makes a polar angle $\\alpha$ with $\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_z$. Due to the specified axial symmetry of the easy-axis distribution, we can, without loss of generality, place $\\mathbf{m}$ in the $xz$-plane. Thus, its Cartesian components are $\\mathbf{m} = (\\sin\\alpha, 0, \\cos\\alpha)$.\n\nThe local easy-axis unit vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_i$ is described in spherical coordinates by its polar angle $\\theta$ (relative to $\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_z$) and azimuthal angle $\\phi$. Its components are $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_i = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\nThe dot product $\\mathbf{m} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_i$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{m} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_i = \\sin\\alpha \\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi + \\cos\\alpha \\cos\\theta\n$$\nSquaring this expression yields:\n$$\n(\\mathbf{m} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_i)^2 = \\sin^2\\alpha \\sin^2\\theta \\cos^2\\phi + \\cos^2\\alpha \\cos^2\\theta + 2\\sin\\alpha \\cos\\alpha \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta \\cos\\phi\n$$\nWe now average this quantity over the distribution of $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_i$. The distribution is given as $f(\\theta) \\propto \\exp(\\eta \\cos^2\\theta)$ and is uniform in the azimuthal angle $\\phi \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. The average of a function $G(\\theta, \\phi)$ is performed over the unit sphere solid angle element $d\\Omega = \\sin\\theta d\\theta d\\phi$. Due to the uniformity in $\\phi$, the averaging over $\\phi$ can be done first: $\\langle g(\\phi) \\rangle_\\phi = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} g(\\phi) d\\phi$. We find $\\langle \\cos\\phi \\rangle_\\phi = 0$ and $\\langle \\cos^2\\phi \\rangle_\\phi = 1/2$. Applying these to the terms in $(\\mathbf{m} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_i)^2$:\n- The average of the cross-term containing $\\cos\\phi$ is zero.\n- The average of the first term is $\\sin^2\\alpha \\langle \\sin^2\\theta \\cos^2\\phi \\rangle = \\sin^2\\alpha \\langle \\sin^2\\theta \\rangle_\\eta \\langle \\cos^2\\phi \\rangle_\\phi = \\frac{1}{2}\\sin^2\\alpha \\langle 1-\\cos^2\\theta \\rangle_\\eta$.\n- The average of the second term is $\\cos^2\\alpha \\langle \\cos^2\\theta \\rangle_\\eta$.\n\nHere, $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle_\\eta$ denotes the average over the polar angle $\\theta$ with the weighting factor $\\exp(\\eta \\cos^2\\theta)$, as defined in the problem. Let's denote the second moment $\\langle \\cos^2\\theta \\rangle_\\eta$ by the shorthand $c_2$.\n$$\n\\left\\langle (\\mathbf{m} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_i)^2 \\right\\rangle_{\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_i} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sin^2\\alpha (1 - c_2) + \\cos^2\\alpha \\, c_2\n$$\nUsing the identity $\\cos^2\\alpha = 1 - \\sin^2\\alpha$, we can express this entirely in terms of $\\sin^2\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\left\\langle (\\mathbf{m} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_i)^2 \\right\\rangle_{\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_i} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sin^2\\alpha - \\frac{1}{2}\\sin^2\\alpha \\, c_2 + (1-\\sin^2\\alpha)c_2 = c_2 + \\sin^2\\alpha \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{3}{2}c_2\\right)\n$$\nThis expression can be simplified by introducing the standard nematic order parameter, $S$, which is the average of the second Legendre polynomial $P_2(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2-1)$:\n$$\nS = \\langle P_2(\\cos\\theta) \\rangle_\\eta = \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{2}(3\\cos^2\\theta - 1) \\right\\rangle_\\eta = \\frac{1}{2}(3\\langle \\cos^2\\theta \\rangle_\\eta - 1) = \\frac{1}{2}(3c_2 - 1)\n$$\nFrom this, we have $3c_2-1 = 2S$, or equivalently $\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{3}{2}c_2 = -S$. Substituting this into the expression for the averaged dot product squared:\n$$\n\\left\\langle (\\mathbf{m} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_i)^2 \\right\\rangle_{\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_i} = c_2 - S \\sin^2\\alpha\n$$\nNow, we substitute this back into the formula for the macroscopic energy density $F(\\alpha)$:\n$$\nF(\\alpha) = \\bar{K} \\left(1 - [c_2 - S \\sin^2\\alpha]\\right) = \\bar{K}(1 - c_2) + \\bar{K}S\\sin^2\\alpha\n$$\nThis expression is precisely in the requested second-order uniaxial form $F(\\alpha) = K_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\sin^2 \\alpha + \\text{const}$. By comparing the terms, we identify the effective anisotropy constant $K_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and the constant offset:\n$$\nK_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\bar{K} S = \\bar{K} \\langle P_2(\\cos\\theta) \\rangle_\\eta\n$$\n$$\n\\text{const} = \\bar{K}(1 - c_2) = \\bar{K}(1 - \\langle \\cos^2\\theta \\rangle_\\eta)\n$$\nOur goal is to find $K_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. Substituting the expressions for $\\bar{K}$ and $S$:\n$$\nK_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\exp\\left(\\mu + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right) \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{2}(3\\cos^2\\theta - 1) \\right\\rangle_\\eta\n$$\nUsing the integral definition provided, with $u=\\cos\\theta$:\n$$\nK_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\exp\\left(\\mu + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right) \\frac{\\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{1}{2}(3u^2 - 1) \\exp(\\eta u^2) \\, \\mathrm{d}u}{\\int_{-1}^{1} \\exp(\\eta u^2) \\, \\mathrm{d}u}\n$$\nThis is the final expression for $K_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ that we will implement numerically.\nFor the special case $\\eta=0$, the distribution is isotropic. The integrals become $ \\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{1}{2}(3u^2-1) \\mathrm{d}u = \\frac{1}{2}[u^3 - u]_{-1}^1 = 0 $, so $S = 0$ and $K_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 0$. This reflects the physical reality that a macroscopically isotropic system has no net anisotropy.\nFor $\\eta > 0$, the axes prefer to align with the $z$-axis, so $S>0$ and $K_{\\mathrm{eff}}>0$ (easy-axis anisotropy).\nFor $\\eta < 0$, the axes prefer the $xy$-plane, so $S<0$ and $K_{\\mathrm{eff}}<0$ (easy-plane anisotropy).\n\nThe provided Python code implements this formula. It defines a function to calculate $K_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ for a given set of parameters $(\\mu, \\sigma, \\eta)$. It numerically evaluates the required integrals using `scipy.integrate.quad`. The code then iterates through the specified test cases, computes $K_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ for each, formats the results to six decimal places, and prints them in the required list format.",
