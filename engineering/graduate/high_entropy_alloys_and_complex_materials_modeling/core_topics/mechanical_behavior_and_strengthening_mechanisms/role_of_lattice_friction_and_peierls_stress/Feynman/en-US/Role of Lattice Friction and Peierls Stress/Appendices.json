            "problem": "A key resistance to dislocation motion in crystalline solids is the lattice friction arising from the Peierls barrier. In high-entropy alloys (HEAs), local lattice distortions and chemical disorder modify the barrier amplitude but the fundamental mechanism of thermally activated glide remains governed by transition-state theory. Consider a straight screw dislocation segment of unit line length with Burgers vector magnitude $b$ in a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) high-entropy alloy. Model the enthalpy landscape for glide along the reaction coordinate $x$ by a periodic Peierls potential and an external tilt due to the resolved shear stress $\\tau$, such that the enthalpy per unit line length is\n$$\nH(x) = U_{0}\\left[1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{b}\\right)\\right] - \\tau\\, b\\, x,\n$$\nwhere $U_{0} > 0$ is the amplitude of the Peierls potential per period $b$.

            "solution": "The problem provides the enthalpy per unit line length, $H(x)$, for a screw dislocation segment as a function of its position $x$ along the glide direction. The enthalpy landscape is a superposition of a periodic Peierls potential and a linear tilt due to an external resolved shear stress $\\tau$. The expression is:\n$$\nH(x) = U_{0}\\left[1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{b}\\right)\\right] - \\tau\\, b\\, x\n$$\nwhere $U_0 > 0$ is the potential amplitude, and $b$ is the Burgers vector magnitude, which corresponds to the period of the potential.\n\nThe activation enthalpy for dislocation glide, $\\Delta H(\\tau)$, is the energy barrier that must be overcome for the dislocation to move from a stable equilibrium position (a local minimum of $H(x)$) to an unstable one (a saddle point of $H(x)$). To find these positions, we must first find the stationary points of $H(x)$ by setting its first derivative with respect to $x$ to zero.\n\nThe first derivative of $H(x)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dH}{dx} = U_{0}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{b}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{b}\\right) - \\tau b\n$$\nSetting $\\frac{dH}{dx} = 0$ gives the condition for stationary points:\n$$\n\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{b}\\right) = \\frac{\\tau b^2}{2\\pi U_0}\n$$\n\nTo classify these stationary points as minima or saddle points (maxima in this 1D case), we examine the sign of the second derivative, $\\frac{d^2H}{dx^2}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2H}{dx^2} = U_{0}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{b}\\right)^2\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{b}\\right)\n$$\nA local minimum corresponds to $\\frac{d^2H}{dx^2} > 0$, which implies $\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{b}\\right) > 0$.\nA saddle point corresponds to $\\frac{d^2H}{dx^2} < 0$, which implies $\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{b}\\right) < 0$.\n\nFirst, we determine the zero-stress activation barrier, $\\Delta H_0$. This is the barrier when $\\tau = 0$. For $\\tau=0$, the condition for stationary points becomes $\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{b}\\right) = 0$. This occurs when $\\frac{2\\pi x}{b} = n\\pi$ for any integer $n$, or $x = n\\frac{b}{2}$.\n-   For even $n$ (e.g., $x=0, b, ...$), $\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{b}\\right) = 1$, so $\\frac{d^2H}{dx^2} > 0$. These are the energy minima. The enthalpy is $H_{min} = U_0(1-1) - 0 = 0$.\n-   For odd $n$ (e.g., $x=b/2, 3b/2, ...$), $\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{b}\\right) = -1$, so $\\frac{d^2H}{dx^2} < 0$. These are the saddle points. The enthalpy is $H_{sad} = U_0(1-(-1)) - 0 = 2U_0$.\nThe zero-stress barrier is therefore:\n$$\n\\Delta H_0 = H_{sad} - H_{min} = 2U_0 - 0 = 2U_0\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the Peierls stress, $\\tau_P$, which is the stress at which the activation barrier vanishes. This occurs when a minimum and a saddle point coalesce into an inflection point, where both $\\frac{dH}{dx} = 0$ and $\\frac{d^2H}{dx^2} = 0$ are satisfied simultaneously.\nFrom $\\frac{d^2H}{dx^2} = 0$, we have $\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{b}\\right) = 0$. For such positions, $\\left|\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{b}\\right)\\right|=1$. Substituting this into the stationary point condition gives the maximum possible stress that the lattice resistance can balance:\n$$\n1 = \\frac{\\tau_P b^2}{2\\pi U_0} \\implies \\tau_P = \\frac{2\\pi U_0}{b^2}\n$$\n\nNow, we derive the activation enthalpy $\\Delta H(\\tau)$ for an arbitrary stress $0 \\le \\tau \\le \\tau_P$. We can define a normalized stress $\\sigma = \\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_P}$. Using the expressions for $\\tau_P$ and $U_0$:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_P} = \\frac{\\tau}{2\\pi U_0 / b^2} = \\frac{\\tau b^2}{2\\pi U_0}\n$$\nThe stationary point condition becomes $\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{b}\\right) = \\sigma$. Since $0 \\le \\tau \\le \\tau_P$, we have $0 \\le \\sigma \\le 1$.\nIn the interval $[0, \\pi]$, there are two solutions for $\\theta = \\frac{2\\pi x}{b}$:\n1.  $\\theta_{min} = \\arcsin(\\sigma)$. Here, $\\cos(\\theta_{min}) = \\sqrt{1-\\sigma^2} > 0$, so this is a local minimum, $x_{min} = \\frac{b}{2\\pi}\\arcsin(\\sigma)$.\n2.  $\\theta_{sad} = \\pi - \\arcsin(\\sigma)$. Here, $\\cos(\\theta_{sad}) = -\\sqrt{1-\\sigma^2} < 0$, so this is a saddle point, $x_{sad} = \\frac{b}{2\\pi}(\\pi - \\arcsin(\\sigma))$.\n\nThe activation enthalpy is $\\Delta H(\\tau) = H(x_{sad}) - H(x_{min})$:\n$$\n\\Delta H(\\tau) = \\left( U_0\\left(1-\\cos\\theta_{sad}\\right) - \\tau b x_{sad} \\right) - \\left( U_0\\left(1-\\cos\\theta_{min}\\right) - \\tau b x_{min} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta H(\\tau) = U_0 \\left(\\cos\\theta_{min} - \\cos\\theta_{sad}\\right) - \\tau b \\left(x_{sad} - x_{min}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the terms:\n- $\\cos\\theta_{min} - \\cos\\theta_{sad} = \\sqrt{1-\\sigma^2} - (-\\sqrt{1-\\sigma^2}) = 2\\sqrt{1-\\sigma^2}$.\n- $x_{sad} - x_{min} = \\frac{b}{2\\pi}[(\\pi - \\arcsin\\sigma) - \\arcsin\\sigma] = \\frac{b}{2\\pi}(\\pi - 2\\arcsin\\sigma)$.\n- $\\tau b = \\sigma \\tau_P b = \\sigma \\frac{2\\pi U_0}{b^2} b = \\sigma \\frac{2\\pi U_0}{b}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\Delta H(\\tau)$:\n$$\n\\Delta H(\\tau) = U_0 \\left(2\\sqrt{1-\\sigma^2}\\right) - \\left(\\sigma \\frac{2\\pi U_0}{b}\\right) \\left(\\frac{b}{2\\pi}(\\pi - 2\\arcsin\\sigma)\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta H(\\tau) = 2U_0\\sqrt{1-\\sigma^2} - \\sigma U_0 (\\pi - 2\\arcsin\\sigma)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta H(\\tau) = 2U_0\\left[\\sqrt{1-\\sigma^2} - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\sigma + \\sigma\\arcsin\\sigma\\right]\n$$\nNow, we express this in terms of $\\Delta H_0 = 2U_0$ and $\\sigma = \\tau/\\tau_P$:\n$$\n\\Delta H(\\tau) = \\Delta H_0 \\left[\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_P}\\right)^2} - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_P} + \\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_P}\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_P}\\right)\\right]\n$$\nTo obtain a more compact form, we use the identity $\\arcsin(z) + \\arccos(z) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, which gives $\\arcsin(z) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\arccos(z)$.\n$$\n\\Delta H(\\tau) = \\Delta H_0 \\left[\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_P}\\right)^2} - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_P} + \\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_P}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_P}\\right)\\right)\\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta H(\\tau) = \\Delta H_0 \\left[\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_P}\\right)^2} - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_P} + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_P} - \\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_P}\\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_P}\\right)\\right]\n$$\nThe terms involving $\\pi$ cancel, yielding the final expression:\n$$\n\\Delta H(\\tau) = \\Delta H_0 \\left[\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_P}\\right)^2} - \\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_P}\\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_P}\\right)\\right]\n$$\nThis is the closed-form functional dependence of the activation enthalpy $\\Delta H(\\tau)$ on the applied stress $\\tau$ in terms of the zero-stress barrier $\\Delta H_0$ and the Peierls stress $\\tau_P$.",

The solution proceeds by first validating the problem and then executing the required derivations and calculations.\n\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in the established theory of dislocation mechanics in BCC crystals, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is expressed objectively.\n\nThe fundamental condition for dislocation motion at low temperatures (where thermal activation is negligible) is that the effective driving stress, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, must overcome the intrinsic lattice resistance, known as the Peierls stress, $\\tau_{P}$. This is a force-balance condition.\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\tau_{P}\n$$\nThe problem provides a model for the effective driving stress that accounts for non-Schmid effects, where non-glide components of the stress tensor influence dislocation motion. The model is given as:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\tau + \\alpha \\,\\sigma_{n} + \\beta \\,\\tau_{\\perp}\n$$\nHere, $\\tau$ is the resolved shear stress on the slip system $\\{110\\}\\langle 111\\rangle$, $\\sigma_{n}$ is the normal stress on the slip plane, and $\\tau_{\\perp}$ is the shear stress on the slip plane but perpendicular to the slip direction. The coefficients $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ quantify the coupling of these non-glide stresses to the dislocation core.\n\nThe critical resolved shear stress, $\\tau_c$, is the specific value of $\\tau$ at which dislocation motion initiates. By substituting the expression for $\\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ into the force-balance condition, we can solve for $\\tau_c$:\n$$\n\\tau_{c} + \\alpha \\,\\sigma_{n} + \\beta \\,\\tau_{\\perp} = \\tau_{P}\n$$\nRearranging for $\\tau_c$ gives the general symbolic expression for the CRSS:\n$$\n\\tau_{c} = \\tau_{P} - \\alpha \\,\\sigma_{n} - \\beta \\,\\tau_{\\perp}\n$$\nThis equation shows that the CRSS is not a constant material property but depends on the full stress state via the non-glide components $\\sigma_n$ and $\\tau_{\\perp}$.\n\nWe now apply this general expression to the specific cases of forward and reverse slip. The problem states that the perpendicular shear stress $\\tau_{\\perp}$ has opposite signs for these two cases.\n\nFor forward slip, denoted by the superscript `+`, the stress components are applied as given.

Let $\\tau_{\\perp, \\text{rev}}$ be the value for reverse slip, where $\\tau_{\\perp, \\text{rev}} = -\\tau_{\\perp, \\text{fwd}}$. The CRSS for reverse slip, $\\tau_c^{-}$, is:\n$$\n\\tau_{c}^{-} = \\tau_{P} - \\alpha \\,\\sigma_{n} - \\beta \\,\\tau_{\\perp, \\text{rev}} = \\tau_{P} - \\alpha \\,\\sigma_{n} - \\beta \\,(-\\tau_{\\perp, \\text{fwd}})\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_{c}^{-} = \\tau_{P} - \\alpha \\,\\sigma_{n} + \\beta \\,\\tau_{\\perp, \\text{fwd}}\n$$\nThe asymmetry in CRSS, $\\Delta$, is defined as the difference between the reverse and forward slip stresses:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\tau_{c}^{-} - \\tau_{c}^{+}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived symbolic expressions for $\\tau_c^{-}$ and $\\tau_c^{+}$:\n$$\n\\Delta = (\\tau_{P} - \\alpha \\,\\sigma_{n} + \\beta \\,\\tau_{\\perp, \\text{fwd}}) - (\\tau_{P} - \\alpha \\,\\sigma_{n} - \\beta \\,\\tau_{\\perp, \\text{fwd}})\n$$\nThe terms $\\tau_{P}$ and $\\alpha \\,\\sigma_{n}$ cancel out upon subtraction:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\beta \\,\\tau_{\\perp, \\text{fwd}} - (-\\beta \\,\\tau_{\\perp, \\text{fwd}}) = 2 \\beta \\,\\tau_{\\perp, \\text{fwd}}\n$$\nThis is the symbolic expression for the asymmetry $\\Delta$.\n\nThe physical reason for this asymmetry ($\\Delta \\neq 0$) lies in the structure of the screw dislocation core in BCC materials. The core is non-planar, spreading across several intersecting $\\{110\\}$ planes. This complex, three-dimensional structure makes it sensitive to stress components other than the main driving shear stress $\\tau$. The coefficient $\\beta$ quantifies this sensitivity to the perpendicular shear stress $\\tau_{\\perp}$. A non-zero $\\beta$ means that $\\tau_{\\perp}$ can distort the core, either making it easier or harder to transform into a mobile configuration. When the sense of slip is reversed (from forward to reverse), the sign of $\\tau_{\\perp}$ also reverses. This changes its effect on the core from, for example, assisting motion to resisting it. The result is that a different magnitude of the primary driving stress $\\tau$ is required to initiate motion in the forward and reverse directions. This difference, $\\Delta$, is a direct manifestation of the non-Schmid behavior and the core's structural response to the full stress tensor. The term $\\alpha \\sigma_n$ also contributes to the non-Schmid effect by making the CRSS dependent on the normal stress, but it does not contribute to the asymmetry $\\Delta$ as defined here because $\\sigma_n$ is assumed to be the same for both slip directions.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $\\Delta$ using the given parameters:\n- $\\beta = 0.35$\n- $\\tau_{\\perp, \\text{fwd}} = +0.18 \\,\\text{GPa}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\Delta$:\n$$\n\\Delta = 2 \\times 0.35 \\times (0.18 \\,\\text{GPa})\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta = 0.70 \\times 0.18 \\,\\text{GPa} = 0.126 \\,\\text{GPa}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in megapascals (MPa).

It is valid for solution.\n\nTask 1: Derivation of the lattice-friction stress $\\tau_{\\mathrm{L}}(T)$\nThe lattice friction stress, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{L}}$, is the stress component that assists thermal energy in overcoming the Peierls barrier. Thus, the generic stress $\\tau$ in the velocity equation corresponds to $\\tau_{\\mathrm{L}}$.\nWe begin with the Orowan relation for plastic strain rate:\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon} = \\rho_{\\mathrm{m}} b v $$\nThe mobile dislocation density $\\rho_{\\mathrm{m}}$ is a fraction $f$ of the total statistically stored dislocation density $\\rho$:\n$$ \\rho_{\\mathrm{m}} = f \\rho $$\nSubstituting this and the expression for the average dislocation velocity $v$ gives:\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon} = (f \\rho) b \\left[ v_{0} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta F - \\tau_{\\mathrm{L}} V}{k_{B} T}\\right) \\right] $$\nWe rearrange this equation to solve for $\\tau_{\\mathrm{L}}$. First, isolate the exponential term:\n$$ \\frac{\\dot{\\epsilon}}{f \\rho b v_{0}} = \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta F - \\tau_{\\mathrm{L}} V}{k_{B} T}\\right) $$\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\dot{\\epsilon}}{f \\rho b v_{0}}\\right) = -\\frac{\\Delta F - \\tau_{\\mathrm{L}} V}{k_{B} T} $$\nMultiplying by $-k_{B}T$ and using the property $\\ln(1/x) = -\\ln(x)$:\n$$ -k_{B} T \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\dot{\\epsilon}}{f \\rho b v_{0}}\\right) = k_{B} T \\ln\\left(\\frac{f \\rho b v_{0}}{\\dot{\\epsilon}}\\right) = \\Delta F - \\tau_{\\mathrm{L}} V $$\nNow, we solve for $\\tau_{\\mathrm{L}}$:\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{L}} V = \\Delta F - k_{B} T \\ln\\left(\\frac{f \\rho b v_{0}}{\\dot{\\epsilon}}\\right) $$\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{L}}(T, \\rho) = \\frac{\\Delta F}{V} - \\frac{k_{B} T}{V} \\ln\\left(\\frac{f \\rho b v_{0}}{\\dot{\\epsilon}}\\right) $$\nThis is the explicit expression for the lattice-friction stress. It depends on temperature $T$ and dislocation density $\\rho$.\n\nTask 2: Expression for the total flow stress $\\tau_{\\mathrm{total}}(T;\\rho,d)$\nThe total resolved shear flow stress is the sum of the athermal and thermal contributions:\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{total}}(T;\\rho,d) = \\tau_{\\mathrm{ath}}(\\rho,d) + \\tau_{\\mathrm{L}}(T, \\rho) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for each component:\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{total}}(T;\\rho,d) = \\left( \\alpha G b \\sqrt{\\rho} + k_{\\tau} d^{-1/2} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{\\Delta F}{V} - \\frac{k_{B} T}{V} \\ln\\left(\\frac{f \\rho b v_{0}}{\\dot{\\epsilon}}\\right) \\right) $$\nThis general expression applies to both microstructures A and B by substituting their respective values for $\\rho$ and $d$.\n\nTask 3: Calculation of the slope ratio $\\frac{S(\\rho_{\\mathrm{A}})}{S(\\rho_{\\mathrm{B}})}$\nThe temperature-derivative slope $S(\\rho)$ is defined as:\n$$ S(\\rho) \\equiv -\\frac{d \\tau_{\\mathrm{total}}}{d T} $$\nWe compute the derivative of $\\tau_{\\mathrm{total}}$ with respect to temperature $T$, holding all other parameters constant:\n$$ \\frac{d \\tau_{\\mathrm{total}}}{d T} = \\frac{d}{dT} \\left[ \\left( \\alpha G b \\sqrt{\\rho} + k_{\\tau} d^{-1/2} \\right) + \\frac{\\Delta F}{V} - \\frac{k_{B} T}{V} \\ln\\left(\\frac{f \\rho b v_{0}}{\\dot{\\epsilon}}\\right) \\right] $$\nThe athermal term $(\\alpha G b \\sqrt{\\rho} + k_{\\tau} d^{-1/2})$ and the term $\\frac{\\Delta F}{V}$ are, by definition, independent of temperature. Their derivatives with respect to $T$ are zero.\n$$ \\frac{d \\tau_{\\mathrm{total}}}{d T} = \\frac{d}{dT} \\left[ - \\frac{k_{B} T}{V} \\ln\\left(\\frac{f \\rho b v_{0}}{\\dot{\\epsilon}}\\right) \\right] $$\nThe term $\\ln\\left(\\frac{f \\rho b v_{0}}{\\dot{\\epsilon}}\\right)$ is constant with respect to $T$. The derivative is:\n$$ \\frac{d \\tau_{\\mathrm{total}}}{d T} = - \\frac{k_{B}}{V} \\ln\\left(\\frac{f \\rho b v_{0}}{\\dot{\\epsilon}}\\right) $$\nTherefore, the slope $S(\\rho)$ is:\n$$ S(\\rho) = - \\left( - \\frac{k_{B}}{V} \\ln\\left(\\frac{f \\rho b v_{0}}{\\dot{\\epsilon}}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{k_{B}}{V} \\ln\\left(\\frac{f \\rho b v_{0}}{\\dot{\\epsilon}}\\right) $$\nNow we form the ratio for microstructures A and B:\n$$ \\frac{S(\\rho_{\\mathrm{A}})}{S(\\rho_{\\mathrm{B}})} = \\frac{\\frac{k_{B}}{V} \\ln\\left(\\frac{f \\rho_{\\mathrm{A}} b v_{0}}{\\dot{\\epsilon}}\\right)}{\\frac{k_{B}}{V} \\ln\\left(\\frac{f \\rho_{\\mathrm{B}} b v_{0}}{\\dot{\\epsilon}}\\right)} = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{f \\rho_{\\mathrm{A}} b v_{0}}{\\dot{\\epsilon}}\\right)}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{f \\rho_{\\mathrm{B}} b v_{0}}{\\dot{\\epsilon}}\\right)} $$\nWe now substitute the numerical values to compute the ratio.\nLet's compute the argument of the logarithm for each case.\nFor microstructure A:\n$$ \\frac{f \\rho_{\\mathrm{A}} b v_{0}}{\\dot{\\epsilon}} = \\frac{(0.05) \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{14} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2}) \\times (2.55 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\mathrm{m}) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{3} \\ \\mathrm{m/s})}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} $$\n$$ = \\frac{0.05 \\times 5.0 \\times 2.55 \\times 1.0}{1.0} \\times 10^{14-10+3-(-3)} = 0.6375 \\times 10^{10} = 6.375 \\times 10^{9} $$\nFor microstructure B:\n$$ \\frac{f \\rho_{\\mathrm{B}} b v_{0}}{\\dot{\\epsilon}} = \\frac{(0.05) \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{14} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2}) \\times (2.55 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\mathrm{m}) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{3} \\ \\mathrm{m/s})}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} $$\n$$ = \\frac{0.05 \\times 2.0 \\times 2.55 \\times 1.0}{1.0} \\times 10^{14-10+3-(-3)} = 0.255 \\times 10^{10} = 2.55 \\times 10^{9} $$\nThe ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{S(\\rho_{\\mathrm{A}})}{S(\\rho_{\\mathrm{B}})} = \\frac{\\ln(6.375 \\times 10^{9})}{\\ln(2.55 \\times 10^{9})} $$\nCalculating the values of the logarithms:\n$$ \\ln(6.375 \\times 10^{9}) \\approx 22.575567 $$\n$$ \\ln(2.55 \\times 10^{9}) \\approx 21.659395 $$\nThe ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{S(\\rho_{\\mathrm{A}})}{S(\\rho_{\\mathrm{B}})} \\approx \\frac{22.575567}{21.659395} \\approx 1.042298 $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested gives $1.042$.",
