This exercise explores the fundamental mechanics of dislocation bowing under an applied stress, governed by a balance between the Peach-Koehler force and the dislocation's own line tension .

            "problem": "Consider a single straight dislocation segment pinned at two immobile, strong obstacles separated by a fixed distance $L$ along the $x$-axis. This represents the foundational Orowan bowing mechanism. The dislocation lies in its glide plane. An externally applied, uniform resolved shear stress $\\tau$ acts to bow the dislocation between the pins. The segment is treated as an elastic line with a constant line tension $T$ and Burgers vector magnitude $b$. Assume isotropic elastic behavior.\n\nStarting from local mechanical equilibrium of a one-dimensional line under a uniform transverse force per unit length and using geometric relations for a plane curve, derive the equilibrium bowing profile $y(x)$ of the dislocation between the pins located at $\\left(x,y\\right)=\\left(\\pm L/2,0\\right)$ as a function of $\\tau$, $T$, and $b$, under the assumption of symmetry about $x=0$. Then, identify the critical stress $\\tau_{c}$ at which the pinned configuration ceases to have a static solution and the dislocation depins (i.e., emits a loop) under continued loading. Provide the closed-form expression for $\\tau_{c}$ in terms of $T$, $b$, and $L$, and state the corresponding limiting shape at the threshold.\n\nFinally, evaluate $\\tau_{c}$ numerically for the parameter values $T = 2.50 \\times 10^{-10} \\,\\text{N}$, $b = 0.255 \\,\\text{nm}$, and $L = 200 \\,\\text{nm}$. Round your numerical answer to four significant figures and express the final stress in megapascal (MPa). Provide only the numerical value of $\\tau_{c}$ as your final answer.",
            "solution": "The equilibrium configuration of the dislocation line is determined by the balance of forces acting upon it. An externally applied resolved shear stress $\\tau$ exerts a force per unit length on the dislocation, given by $f_s = \\tau b$, where $b$ is the magnitude of the Burgers vector. This force acts in the glide plane and is perpendicular to the dislocation line. The line tension $T$ of the dislocation gives rise to a restoring force that opposes the bowing. For a curved line, this restoring force per unit length is $f_T = T \\kappa$, where $\\kappa$ is the local curvature of the line. This force is directed towards the center of curvature.\n\nIn mechanical equilibrium, these two forces must balance at every point along the dislocation line:\n$$\n\\tau b = T \\kappa\n$$\nThis equilibrium condition implies that the curvature $\\kappa$ must be constant along the entire length of the bowed segment:\n$$\n\\kappa = \\frac{\\tau b}{T}\n$$\nA plane curve with constant curvature is an arc of a circle. The radius of curvature $R$ is the reciprocal of the curvature:\n$$\nR = \\frac{1}{\\kappa} = \\frac{T}{\\tau b}\n$$\nThe problem states that the dislocation is pinned between two points located at $(x,y) = (\\pm L/2, 0)$ and that the equilibrium profile $y(x)$ is symmetric about $x=0$. Due to this symmetry, the center of the circular arc must lie on the $y$-axis. Let the center of the circle be at $(0, k_c)$. The equation of the circle is then:\n$$\nx^2 + (y - k_c)^2 = R^2\n$$\nTo find the coordinate $k_c$, we use the boundary condition that the dislocation passes through the pinning points, for example, $(L/2, 0)$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right)^2 + (0 - k_c)^2 = R^2\n$$\n$$\nk_c^2 = R^2 - \\frac{L^2}{4} \\implies k_c = \\pm \\sqrt{R^2 - \\frac{L^2}{4}}\n$$\nLet us assume the dislocation bows into the positive $y$ region, so $y(x) \\ge 0$. For this to occur, the center of curvature must be in the negative $y$ region, so we choose $k_c = - \\sqrt{R^2 - L^2/4}$. The equation for the dislocation profile is obtained by solving for $y(x)$ from the circle equation, taking the appropriate branch that passes through the pins and lies in the upper half-plane:\n$$\ny(x) = k_c + \\sqrt{R^2 - x^2} = \\sqrt{R^2 - x^2} - \\sqrt{R^2 - \\frac{L^2}{4}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the radius $R = T/(\\tau b)$, we obtain the equilibrium bowing profile $y(x)$ as a function of the given parameters:\n$$\ny(x) = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{T}{\\tau b}\\right)^2 - x^2} - \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{T}{\\tau b}\\right)^2 - \\frac{L^2}{4}}\n$$\nThis equation describes the shape of the dislocation line for a given applied stress $\\tau$. A static solution exists only if the term under the square root is real, which requires $R^2 \\ge L^2/4$, or $R \\ge L/2$.\n\nThe critical stress $\\tau_c$ for depinning is reached when the configuration becomes unstable. This occurs at the physical limit of the bowing geometry, which corresponds to the minimum possible radius of curvature, $R_{min}$. From the condition $R \\ge L/2$, the minimum radius is:\n$$\nR_{min} = \\frac{L}{2}\n$$\nAt this critical radius, the dislocation forms a perfect semicircle with diameter $L$ connecting the two pinning points. The center of the circle is at the origin $(0,0)$. The tangents to the semicircle at the pinning points $(\\pm L/2, 0)$ are vertical, meaning the dislocation segments approach each other at an angle of $180^\\circ$. Any further increase in stress (which would require $R < L/2$) is not possible for a static pinned configuration, leading to breakaway and the emission of a dislocation loop.\n\nThe critical stress $\\tau_c$ is the stress corresponding to $R_{min}$:\n$$\nR_{min} = \\frac{T}{\\tau_c b}\n$$\nSubstituting $R_{min} = L/2$:\n$$\n\\frac{L}{2} = \\frac{T}{\\tau_c b}\n$$\nSolving for the critical stress $\\tau_c$, we find:\n$$\n\\tau_c = \\frac{2T}{bL}\n$$\nThe corresponding limiting shape at this threshold is a semicircle of radius $L/2$ centered at the origin, given by the equation $x^2 + y^2 = (L/2)^2$ for $y \\ge 0$.\n\nFinally, we evaluate $\\tau_c$ numerically using the provided parameter values:\n$T = 2.50 \\times 10^{-10} \\,\\text{N}$\n$b = 0.255 \\,\\text{nm} = 0.255 \\times 10^{-9} \\,\\text{m}$\n$L = 200 \\,\\text{nm} = 200 \\times 10^{-9} \\,\\text{m}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\tau_c$:\n$$\n\\tau_c = \\frac{2 \\times (2.50 \\times 10^{-10} \\,\\text{N})}{(0.255 \\times 10^{-9} \\,\\text{m}) \\times (200 \\times 10^{-9} \\,\\text{m})}\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_c = \\frac{5.00 \\times 10^{-10} \\,\\text{N}}{51.0 \\times 10^{-18} \\,\\text{m}^2} = \\frac{5.00}{51.0} \\times 10^8 \\,\\text{Pa}\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_c \\approx 0.0980392... \\times 10^8 \\,\\text{Pa} = 9.80392... \\times 10^6 \\,\\text{Pa}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in megapascals (MPa), where $1 \\,\\text{MPa} = 10^6 \\,\\text{Pa}$.\n$$\n\\tau_c \\approx 9.80392... \\,\\text{MPa}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\n\\tau_c \\approx 9.804 \\,\\text{MPa}\n$$\nThe numerical value for the final answer is $9.804$.",
