Over a short interval of deformation, the true flow stress is approximately constant at $\\sigma=1.0\\times 10^{9}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$ while the true plastic strain accumulates from $\\epsilon=0$ to $\\epsilon=0.10$. Assume that the deformation is spatially homogeneous over the gage volume and that the process is adiabatic over the deformation timescale.

            "solution": "The derivation begins with the first law of thermodynamics for a closed system, which states that the change in internal energy, $dU$, is equal to the heat added to the system, $dQ$, plus the work done on the system, $dW$:\n$$dU = dQ + dW$$\nThe problem states the process is adiabatic, which means there is no heat exchange with the surroundings, so $dQ=0$. Therefore, the change in internal energy is solely due to the work done on the material:\n$$dU = dW$$\nThe work done on the material, $dW$, consists of both elastic and plastic work. The temperature rise is associated with the inelastic (dissipative) part of the deformation. The problem provides that a fraction $\\beta$ of the plastic work density is converted into heat. The mechanical power density (work rate per unit volume) under uniaxial loading is given by the product of true stress $\\sigma$ and true strain rate $\\dot{\\epsilon}$. For plastic deformation, this is $\\dot{w}_p = \\sigma \\dot{\\epsilon}_p$.\nThe rate of heat generation per unit volume, $\\dot{q}_{gen}$, is therefore:\n$$\\dot{q}_{gen} = \\beta \\dot{w}_p = \\beta \\sigma \\dot{\\epsilon}_p$$\nThis generated heat increases the thermal energy of the material, causing its temperature $T$ to rise. The rate of increase of thermal energy per unit volume is given by $\\rho c_p \\dot{T}$, where $\\dot{T}$ is the rate of temperature change. Equating the rate of heat generation with the rate of thermal energy storage gives:\n$$\\rho c_p \\dot{T} = \\beta \\sigma \\dot{\\epsilon}_p$$\nFrom this, we can express the rate of temperature change:\n$$\\dot{T} = \\frac{dT}{dt} = \\frac{\\beta \\sigma}{\\rho c_p} \\dot{\\epsilon}_p = \\frac{\\beta \\sigma}{\\rho c_p} \\frac{d\\epsilon_p}{dt}$$\nTo find the total temperature rise, $\\Delta T$, over a finite interval of plastic strain from $\\epsilon_{p,i}$ to $\\epsilon_{p,f}$, we must integrate this expression. We can rearrange the differential equation to integrate with respect to plastic strain $\\epsilon_p$:\n$$d T = \\frac{\\beta \\sigma(\\epsilon_p)}{\\rho c_p} d\\epsilon_p$$\nIntegrating both sides yields the general expression for the adiabatic temperature rise:\n$$\\Delta T = T_f - T_i = \\int_{\\epsilon_{p,i}}^{\\epsilon_{p,f}} \\frac{\\beta \\sigma(\\epsilon_p)}{\\rho c_p} d\\epsilon_p$$\nThe problem specifies that the flow stress $\\sigma$ can be considered constant over the strain interval. The parameters $\\beta$, $\\rho$, and $c_p$ are also given as constants. Therefore, the term $\\frac{\\beta \\sigma}{\\rho c_p}$ can be moved outside the integral:\n$$\\Delta T = \\frac{\\beta \\sigma}{\\rho c_p} \\int_{\\epsilon_{p,i}}^{\\epsilon_{p,f}} d\\epsilon_p$$\nThe integral of $d\\epsilon_p$ is simply the total accumulated plastic strain, $\\Delta \\epsilon_p = \\epsilon_{p,f} - \\epsilon_{p,i}$. This leads to the final expression to be evaluated:\n$$\\Delta T = \\frac{\\beta \\sigma \\Delta \\epsilon_p}{\\rho c_p}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression.

The plastic deformation of a material is governed by a constitutive relation, often expressed as $\\sigma = f(\\epsilon_p, \\dot{\\epsilon}_p, T)$. The flow stress depends on strain (strain hardening), strain rate (strain-rate sensitivity), and temperature (thermal softening). The derivation shows that deformation itself generates a temperature rise, $\\Delta T$. This heating, in turn, influences the flow stress required for further deformation. Specifically, an increase in temperature generally causes thermal softening, i.e., a decrease in flow stress. At high strain rates, the competition between strain hardening (which increases $\\sigma$) and thermal softening (which decreases $\\sigma$) dictates the overall stress-strain response. The significant temperature increase of $\\Delta T \\approx 24.8\\ \\mathrm{K}$ over a small strain of $0.10$ highlights that thermal softening is a critical effect in high-rate deformation. If this effect becomes dominant, it can lead to flow localization and catastrophic failure, for instance, through the formation of adiabatic shear bands. The assumption of a constant flow stress in the problem is a first-order approximation; a more accurate model would solve the coupled equations for stress and temperature evolution simultaneously.",

The flow stress $\\sigma$ is inversely proportional to $\\alpha$ via the pre-factor $1/\\alpha$, while the argument of the $\\mathrm{arcsinh}$ function is independent of $\\alpha$. Physically, $\\alpha$ determines the stress scale at which deformation transitions from a power-law to an exponential-law regime. A larger $\\alpha$ implies this transition occurs at a lower stress, thus reducing the overall stress required for a given strain rate.\nThe sensitivity to the stress exponent $n$ is more complex and non-linear. The parameter $n$ appears as an inverse power, $1/n$, within the argument of the $\\mathrm{arcsinh}$ function. For the given conditions, the base of the power, $Z/A$, is less than $1$. Consequently, an increase in $n$ leads to a decrease in the exponent $1/n$, which in turn increases the value of $(Z/A)^{1/n}$ toward $1$. Since $\\mathrm{arcsinh}$ is a monotonically increasing function, a larger value of $n$ results in a higher calculated stress $\\sigma$. Physically, a larger stress exponent implies that the material's strain rate is more sensitive to stress. Conversely, to maintain a constant strain rate, the stress must be adjusted more significantly in response to changes in material parameters or other conditions, which manifests here as a higher required stress for a larger $n$.",

Define the grid of $N=9$ operating points $(T_j, \\dot{\\varepsilon}_j)$ from $T \\in \\{900, 1100, 1300\\}\\,\\mathrm{K}$ and $\\dot{\\varepsilon} \\in \\{10^{-4}, 10^{-2}, 1.0\\}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The grain size is fixed at $d = 1.0\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n2.  For each point $(T_j, \\dot{\\varepsilon}_j)$, calculate the stress $\\sigma$ using the given model and parameter values.\n3.  For the same point, calculate the six partial derivatives $\\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial \\theta_i}$ using the expressions derived above.\n4.  Compute the dimensionless local sensitivity for each parameter $\\theta_i$: $s_i(T_j, \\dot{\\varepsilon}_j) = \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial \\theta_i} \\cdot \\frac{\\theta_i}{\\sigma}$.\n5.  After computing $s_i$ over all $N$ grid points, calculate the global influence of each parameter $\\theta_i$ by taking the mean of the absolute values of the local sensitivities:\n    $$\n    \\bar{S}_i = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\left| s_i(T_j, \\dot{\\varepsilon}_j) \\right|\n    $$\n6.  Finally, sort the parameter indices $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$ in descending order of their corresponding global influence values $\\bar{S}_i$. This provides the ranking of parameters from most to least influential. This process is repeated for each of the three provided parameter sets.",
