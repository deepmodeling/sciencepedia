            "problem": "A multicomponent high-entropy alloy is considered on a body-centered cubic lattice. In the disordered state it forms a random solid solution on a single sublattice, while in the ordered state it forms an ordered B2 intermetallic with two interpenetrating simple-cubic sublattices of equal site fraction. Ignore vacancies and antisite defects and neglect vibrational, electronic, and magnetic contributions to the entropy. Begin from the Boltzmann relation $S = k_{B} \\ln W$ and count configurations using lattice-site combinatorics with Stirling’s approximation to obtain the configurational entropy for each state.\n\nConsider an equiatomic quinary alloy composed of Al, Ni, Co, Fe, and Cr, with overall atomic fractions $x_{\\mathrm{Al}} = x_{\\mathrm{Ni}} = x_{\\mathrm{Co}} = x_{\\mathrm{Fe}} = x_{\\mathrm{Cr}} = 0.2$. In the ordered B2 state, let the A-sublattice site fractions be $y_{\\mathrm{Al}}^{(\\mathrm{A})} = 0.35$, $y_{\\mathrm{Ni}}^{(\\mathrm{A})} = 0.15$, $y_{\\mathrm{Co}}^{(\\mathrm{A})} = 0.15$, $y_{\\mathrm{Fe}}^{(\\mathrm{A})} = 0.20$, and $y_{\\mathrm{Cr}}^{(\\mathrm{A})} = 0.15$.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in statistical thermodynamics, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and objectively stated.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first deriving a general expression for the molar configurational entropy of a multicomponent solid solution. This expression is then applied to the two states of the high-entropy alloy: the disordered random solid solution and the ordered B2 intermetallic phase. Finally, the entropy loss upon ordering is calculated by taking the difference between the entropies of these two states.\n\n**1. General Formulation of Molar Configurational Entropy**\n\nThe configurational entropy, $S$, is defined by the Boltzmann relation, $S = k_{B} \\ln W$, where $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant and $W$ is the number of accessible microstates. For a system of $N$ lattice sites occupied by $k$ different atomic species, with $N_i$ atoms of species $i$ (where $\\sum_{i=1}^k N_i = N$), the number of ways to arrange the atoms is given by the multinomial coefficient:\n$$W = \\frac{N!}{N_1! N_2! \\dots N_k!} = \\frac{N!}{\\prod_{i=1}^k N_i!}$$\nThe entropy is thus:\n$$S = k_B \\ln\\left(\\frac{N!}{\\prod_{i=1}^k N_i!}\\right) = k_B \\left( \\ln(N!) - \\sum_{i=1}^k \\ln(N_i!) \\right)$$\nFor a macroscopic system, $N$ and each $N_i$ are very large, so we can use Stirling's approximation, $\\ln(M!) \\approx M \\ln M - M$:\n$$S \\approx k_B \\left( (N \\ln N - N) - \\sum_{i=1}^k (N_i \\ln N_i - N_i) \\right)$$\nRecognizing that $N = \\sum_{i=1}^k N_i$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$S \\approx k_B \\left( N \\ln N - \\sum_{i=1}^k N_i \\ln N_i \\right)$$\nIntroducing the atomic fraction of species $i$, $x_i = N_i/N$, we have $N_i = x_i N$. Substituting this gives:\n$$S \\approx k_B \\left( N \\ln N - \\sum_{i=1}^k (x_i N) \\ln(x_i N) \\right) = -k_B N \\sum_{i=1}^k x_i \\ln x_i$$\nThe molar configurational entropy, $S_m$, is the entropy per mole of atoms. For one mole, $N$ is Avogadro's number, $N_A$. Using the ideal-gas constant $R = N_A k_B$, the molar entropy is:\n$$S_m = -R \\sum_{i=1}^k x_i \\ln x_i$$\n\n**2. Molar Configurational Entropy of the Disordered State ($S_{\\mathrm{random}}$)**\n\nThe disordered state is modeled as a random solid solution on a single lattice. The alloy is an equiatomic quinary mixture of Al, Ni, Co, Fe, and Cr. Thus, there are $k=5$ components, each with an atomic fraction $x_i = 0.2$.\nApplying the general formula:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{random}} = -R \\sum_{i=1}^5 x_i \\ln x_i = -R \\sum_{i=1}^5 (0.2 \\ln 0.2)$$\n$$S_{\\mathrm{random}} = -R \\cdot 5 \\cdot (0.2 \\ln 0.2) = -R \\ln(0.2)$$\n\n**3. Molar Configurational Entropy of the Ordered B2 State ($S_{\\mathrm{B2}}$)**\n\nThe ordered B2 state has two interpenetrating simple-cubic sublattices, A and B, of equal size. For one mole of atoms, each sublattice contains $N_A/2$ sites. The total entropy is the sum of the entropies of the individual sublattices, $S_{\\mathrm{B2}} = S_{\\mathrm{A}} + S_{\\mathrm{B}}$.\nLet $y_i^{(\\mathrm{A})}$ and $y_i^{(\\mathrm{B})}$ be the site fractions of component $i$ on the A and B sublattices, respectively. The molar entropy of the B2 phase is:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{B2}} = -\\frac{R}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^5 y_i^{(\\mathrm{A})} \\ln y_i^{(\\mathrm{A})} - \\frac{R}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^5 y_i^{(\\mathrm{B})} \\ln y_i^{(\\mathrm{B})}$$\n$$S_{\\mathrm{B2}} = -\\frac{R}{2} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^5 y_i^{(\\mathrm{A})} \\ln y_i^{(\\mathrm{A})} + \\sum_{i=1}^5 y_i^{(\\mathrm{B})} \\ln y_i^{(\\mathrm{B})} \\right)$$\nThe overall atomic fraction $x_i$ is related to the sublattice site fractions via the relation $x_i = \\frac{1}{2}y_i^{(\\mathrm{A})} + \\frac{1}{2}y_i^{(\\mathrm{B})}$. This allows us to find the site fractions on sublattice B: $y_i^{(\\mathrm{B})} = 2x_i - y_i^{(\\mathrm{A})}$.\nGiven $x_i = 0.2$ for all $i$ and the A-sublattice fractions $y_i^{(\\mathrm{A})}$, we compute the B-sublattice fractions $y_i^{(\\mathrm{B})}$:\n$y_{\\mathrm{Al}}^{(\\mathrm{B})} = 2(0.2) - 0.35 = 0.05$\n$y_{\\mathrm{Ni}}^{(\\mathrm{B})} = 2(0.2) - 0.15 = 0.25$\n$y_{\\mathrm{Co}}^{(\\mathrm{B})} = 2(0.2) - 0.15 = 0.25$\n$y_{\\mathrm{Fe}}^{(\\mathrm{B})} = 2(0.2) - 0.20 = 0.20$\n$y_{\\mathrm{Cr}}^{(\\mathrm{B})} = 2(0.2) - 0.15 = 0.25$\n\nWe now compute the two sums inside the brackets.\nFor sublattice A:\n$\\sum_A = \\sum y_i^{(\\mathrm{A})} \\ln y_i^{(\\mathrm{A})} = 0.35 \\ln(0.35) + 0.15 \\ln(0.15) + 0.15 \\ln(0.15) + 0.20 \\ln(0.20) + 0.15 \\ln(0.15)$\n$\\sum_A = 0.35 \\ln(0.35) + 3 \\cdot (0.15 \\ln(0.15)) + 0.20 \\ln(0.20) \\approx -1.54303$\nFor sublattice B:\n$\\sum_B = \\sum y_i^{(\\mathrm{B})} \\ln y_i^{(\\mathrm{B})} = 0.05 \\ln(0.05) + 0.25 \\ln(0.25) + 0.25 \\ln(0.25) + 0.20 \\ln(0.20) + 0.25 \\ln(0.25)$\n$\\sum_B = 0.05 \\ln(0.05) + 3 \\cdot (0.25 \\ln(0.25)) + 0.20 \\ln(0.20) \\approx -1.51139$\n\n**4. Calculation of the Molar Configurational Entropy Loss ($\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{loss}}$)**\n\nThe entropy loss is $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{loss}} = S_{\\mathrm{random}} - S_{\\mathrm{B2}}$.\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{loss}} = -R \\ln(0.2) - \\left[ -\\frac{R}{2} \\left( \\sum_A + \\sum_B \\right) \\right]$$\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{loss}} = R \\left[ -\\ln(0.2) + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\sum_A + \\sum_B \\right) \\right]$$\nSubstituting the numerical values and $R = 8.314462618 \\text{ J mol}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1}$:\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{loss}} = 8.314462618 \\left[ -\\ln(0.2) + \\frac{1}{2} (-1.54303 - 1.51139) \\right]$$\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{loss}} = 8.314462618 \\left[ 1.609438 + \\frac{1}{2} (-3.05442) \\right]$$\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{loss}} = 8.314462618 \\left[ 1.609438 - 1.52721 \\right]$$\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{loss}} = 8.314462618 \\times 0.082228 \\approx 0.683728 \\text{ J mol}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the molar configurational entropy loss is $0.6837 \\text{ J mol}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1}$.",

The overall composition $\\boldsymbol{c}^0$ must lie on the tie-line segment connecting $\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha}$ and $\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\beta}$. This means the three points are collinear, and the vector $\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{c}^0$ must be parallel to the tie-line vector $\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\beta} = \\boldsymbol{\\Delta m}$. Thus, we can write:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{c}^{0} = k \\boldsymbol{\\Delta m} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha} = \\boldsymbol{c}^0 + k \\boldsymbol{\\Delta m} $$\nfor some scalar $k$. We can now substitute this expression for $\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha}$ into the simplified intercept equation to find $k$.\n\nFirst, we compute the necessary vectors and products with the given data:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\Delta m} = \\boldsymbol{m}_{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{m}_{\\beta} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.36 \\\\ 0.34 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 0.24 \\\\ 0.58 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.12 \\\\ -0.24 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\mathbf{H} \\boldsymbol{\\Delta m} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0.5 \\\\ 0.5 & 1.5 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.12 \\\\ -0.24 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2(0.12) + 0.5(-0.24) \\\\ 0.5(0.12) + 1.5(-0.24) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.24 - 0.12 \\\\ 0.06 - 0.36 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.12 \\\\ -0.30 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe intercept equation $g_{0}^{\\alpha} - g_{0}^{\\beta} = (\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{m}_{\\alpha})^{\\mathrm{T}} (\\mathbf{H} \\boldsymbol{\\Delta m})$ becomes:\n$$ 0.02 - 0.00 = ((\\boldsymbol{c}^0 + k \\boldsymbol{\\Delta m}) - \\boldsymbol{m}_{\\alpha})^{\\mathrm{T}} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.12 \\\\ -0.30 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ 0.02 = (\\boldsymbol{c}^0 - \\boldsymbol{m}_{\\alpha} + k \\boldsymbol{\\Delta m})^{\\mathrm{T}} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.12 \\\\ -0.30 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nLet's compute the vectors inside the parenthesis:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{c}^0 - \\boldsymbol{m}_{\\alpha} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.30 \\\\ 0.45 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 0.36 \\\\ 0.34 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -0.06 \\\\ 0.11 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe equation becomes:\n$$ 0.02 = \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} -0.06 \\\\ 0.11 \\end{pmatrix} + k \\begin{pmatrix} 0.12 \\\\ -0.24 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)^{\\mathrm{T}} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.12 \\\\ -0.30 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ 0.02 = (-0.06 + 0.12k)(0.12) + (0.11 - 0.24k)(-0.30) $$\n$$ 0.02 = -0.0072 + 0.0144k - 0.033 + 0.072k $$\n$$ 0.02 = -0.0402 + 0.0864k $$\n$$ 0.0602 = 0.0864k $$\n$$ k = \\frac{0.0602}{0.0864} = \\frac{301}{432} \\approx 0.696759 $$\n\nWith $k$, we can find the equilibrium compositions:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha} = \\boldsymbol{c}^0 + k \\boldsymbol{\\Delta m} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.30 \\\\ 0.45 \\end{pmatrix} + \\frac{301}{432} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.12 \\\\ -0.24 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.30 + 0.083611... \\\\ 0.45 - 0.167222... \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.383611... \\\\ 0.282777... \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\beta} = \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{\\Delta m} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.383611... \\\\ 0.282777... \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 0.12 \\\\ -0.24 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.263611... \\\\ 0.522777... \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nFinally, we find the phase fractions using the lever rule, $\\boldsymbol{c}^0 = f_{\\alpha} \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha} + f_{\\beta} \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\beta}$.\nFrom $\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{c}^0 = k\\boldsymbol{\\Delta m}$ and the lever rule $\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{c}^0 = f_{\\beta}(\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\beta}) = f_{\\beta} \\boldsymbol{\\Delta m}$, it is evident that $f_{\\beta} = k$.\n$$ f_{\\beta} = k = \\frac{301}{432} \\approx 0.696759 $$\nAnd $f_{\\alpha} = 1 - f_{\\beta}$:\n$$ f_{\\alpha} = 1 - \\frac{301}{432} = \\frac{131}{432} \\approx 0.303241 $$\n\nRounding the results to four significant figures:\n$c_A^{\\alpha} \\approx 0.3836$\n$c_B^{\\alpha} \\approx 0.2828$\n$c_A^{\\beta} \\approx 0.2636$\n$c_B^{\\beta} \\approx 0.5228$\n$f_{\\alpha} \\approx 0.3032$\n$f_{\\beta} \\approx 0.6968$\n\nThe final result is the row vector $(c_A^{\\alpha},\\,c_B^{\\alpha},\\,c_A^{\\beta},\\,c_B^{\\beta},\\,f_{\\alpha},\\,f_{\\beta})$.",
