The regular solution model and ideal entropy of mixing are standard approximations used in the CALPHAD (Calculation of Phase Diagrams) approach for multicomponent alloys. The components and crystal structures mentioned are common in the study of high-entropy alloys. The numerical values are physically plausible.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined. It requests the calculation of two specific quantities, $G_{\\text{mix}}$ and $T^{\\star}$, and provides all the necessary data, constants, and theoretical frameworks to arrive at a unique solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language.\n- **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup**: The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions. All required interaction parameters and thermodynamic data are provided.\n- **Unrealistic or Infeasible**: The conditions and values are realistic for metallurgical systems. The temperature $T=1200\\ \\text{K}$ is a typical temperature for processing or analysis of such alloys.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a standard thermodynamics calculation representative of problems in physical metallurgy and materials science. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe molar Gibbs free energy of mixing, $G_{\\text{mix}}$, is defined by the relation:\n$$G_{\\text{mix}} = H_{\\text{mix}} - T S_{\\text{mix}}$$\nwhere $H_{\\text{mix}}$ is the molar enthalpy of mixing and $S_{\\text{mix}}$ is the molar entropy of mixing.\n\nFirst, we calculate the molar enthalpy of mixing, $H_{\\text{mix}}$, for the quaternary alloy using the symmetric regular solution model. The formula for a multicomponent system is:\n$$H_{\\text{mix}} = \\sum_{ij} \\Omega_{ij} c_i c_j$$\nThe system has $4$ components, so there are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ unique pairwise interactions. Given the equiatomic composition, the mole fraction for each of the $4$ components is $c_i = 0.25$. Thus, the product of mole fractions for any pair is $c_i c_j = (0.25)^2 = 0.0625$.\nThe expression for $H_{\\text{mix}}$ is:\n$$H_{\\text{mix}} = c_{\\text{Ni}}c_{\\text{Co}}\\Omega_{\\text{Ni-Co}} + c_{\\text{Ni}}c_{\\text{Fe}}\\Omega_{\\text{Ni-Fe}} + c_{\\text{Ni}}c_{\\text{Al}}\\Omega_{\\text{Ni-Al}} + c_{\\text{Co}}c_{\\text{Fe}}\\Omega_{\\text{Co-Fe}} + c_{\\text{Co}}c_{\\text{Al}}\\Omega_{\\text{Co-Al}} + c_{\\text{Fe}}c_{\\text{Al}}\\Omega_{\\text{Fe-Al}}$$\n$$H_{\\text{mix}} = (0.25)^2 (\\Omega_{\\text{Ni-Co}} + \\Omega_{\\text{Ni-Fe}} + \\Omega_{\\text{Ni-Al}} + \\Omega_{\\text{Co-Fe}} + \\Omega_{\\text{Co-Al}} + \\Omega_{\\text{Fe-Al}})$$\nSubstituting the given values for the interaction parameters:\n$$\\sum_{ij} \\Omega_{ij} = (1.0 + 2.0 - 10.0 + 1.5 - 8.0 - 7.0)\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1} = -20.5\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$$\n$$H_{\\text{mix}} = 0.0625 \\times (-20.5\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}) = -1.28125\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the molar entropy of mixing, $S_{\\text{mix}}$. The problem specifies to use the ideal configurational entropy model. For a multicomponent system, this is given by:\n$$S_{\\text{mix}} = -R \\sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i \\ln(c_i)$$\nFor the $4$-component equiatomic alloy, where $c_i = 0.25$ for all $i$:\n$$S_{\\text{mix}} = -R \\left( 4 \\times 0.25 \\ln(0.25) \\right) = -R \\ln(0.25) = R \\ln(4)$$\nUsing the provided value $R = 8.314\\ \\text{J mol}^{-1}\\text{K}^{-1}$:\n$$S_{\\text{mix}} = (8.314\\ \\text{J mol}^{-1}\\text{K}^{-1}) \\times \\ln(4) \\approx 11.52553\\ \\text{J mol}^{-1}\\text{K}^{-1}$$\n\nWe can now compute $G_{\\text{mix}}$ at $T=1200\\ \\text{K}$. To ensure consistent units, we will work in $\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$.\n$$S_{\\text{mix}} \\approx 0.01152553\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}\\text{K}^{-1}$$\n$$G_{\\text{mix}} = H_{\\text{mix}} - T S_{\\text{mix}}$$\n$$G_{\\text{mix}} \\approx -1.28125\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1} - (1200\\ \\text{K}) \\times (0.01152553\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}\\text{K}^{-1})$$\n$$G_{\\text{mix}} \\approx -1.28125 - 13.830636\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$$\n$$G_{\\text{mix}} \\approx -15.111886\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required:\n$$G_{\\text{mix}} = -15.11\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$$\n\nFor the second part, we determine the ordering temperature $T^{\\star}$. This is the temperature at which the Gibbs free energy change for the ordering process, $\\Delta G_{\\text{ord}}$, is zero. The ordering reaction is: disordered fcc $\\rightarrow$ ordered $L1_2$.\nThe Gibbs free energy change for this process is:\n$$\\Delta G_{\\text{ord}} = \\Delta H_{\\text{ord}} - T \\Delta S_{\\text{ord}}$$\nThe problem provides the molar enthalpy change $\\Delta H_{\\text{ord}} = -2.500 \\times 10^3\\ \\text{J mol}^{-1}$ and molar entropy change $\\Delta S_{\\text{ord}} = -2.50\\ \\text{J mol}^{-1}\\text{K}^{-1}$.\nThe ordering is thermodynamically favorable when $\\Delta G_{\\text{ord}}  0$. The transition temperature $T^{\\star}$ is found by setting $\\Delta G_{\\text{ord}} = 0$:\n$$0 = \\Delta H_{\\text{ord}} - T^{\\star} \\Delta S_{\\text{ord}}$$\nSolving for $T^{\\star}$:\n$$T^{\\star} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{ord}}}{\\Delta S_{\\text{ord}}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$T^{\\star} = \\frac{-2.500 \\times 10^3\\ \\text{J mol}^{-1}}{-2.50\\ \\text{J mol}^{-1}\\text{K}^{-1}} = 1000\\ \\text{K}$$\nThe problem requires this answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The exact result is $1000$. To express this value with four significant figures of precision, it is written in scientific notation as $1.000 \\times 10^3$.\n$$T^{\\star} = 1.000 \\times 10^3\\ \\text{K}$$",

The atomic fractions of Co, Cr, Fe, Ni, and Mo are reduced proportionally so that the total atomic fraction remains $1$. The goal is to quantify the change in the Valence Electron Concentration (VEC) due to this boron addition, and then interpret whether this change in electronic concentration, by itself, would be expected to favor or disfavor the emergence of Topologically Close-Packed (TCP) phases.\n\nUse the following fundamental definitions and data:\n- The Valence Electron Concentration (VEC) of a multicomponent alloy is defined by the rule of mixtures,\n$$\\mathrm{VEC} = \\sum_{i} c_{i} z_{i},$$\nwhere $c_{i}$ is the atomic fraction of component $i$ and $z_{i}$ is the number of valence electrons assigned to component $i$ by its group number in the periodic table (for the $d$-block transition metals and $p$-block main group elements considered here).\n- Take the valence electron counts to be $z_{\\mathrm{Co}} = 9$, $z_{\\mathrm{Cr}} = 6$, $z_{\\mathrm{Fe}} = 8$, $z_{\\mathrm{Ni}} = 10$, $z_{\\mathrm{Mo}} = 6$, and $z_{\\mathrm{B}} = 3$.\n- Initially, the quinary Co-Cr-Fe-Ni-Mo HEA is equiatomic, with $c_{\\mathrm{Co}} = c_{\\mathrm{Cr}} = c_{\\mathrm{Fe}} = c_{\\mathrm{Ni}} = c_{\\mathrm{Mo}} = 0.2$.\n- After adding $0.5$ at.% boron, the new atomic fractions satisfy $c_{\\mathrm{B}} = 0.005$ and $c_{\\mathrm{Co}} = c_{\\mathrm{Cr}} = c_{\\mathrm{Fe}} = c_{\\mathrm{Ni}} = c_{\\mathrm{Mo}} = \\frac{1 - c_{\\mathrm{B}}}{5}$.\n\nStarting from the definition of VEC, compute the change in VEC defined as\n$$\\Delta \\mathrm{VEC} = \\mathrm{VEC}_{\\text{after B}} - \\mathrm{VEC}_{\\text{before B}}.$$\nThen, based on well-tested empirical observations that in late transition metal-rich HEAs the face-centered cubic phase stability increases with increasing VEC (with a frequently cited empirical threshold near $\\mathrm{VEC} \\approx 8$) and that the propensity for forming Topologically Close-Packed (TCP) phases generally correlates more strongly with refractory content and chemical partitioning than with small changes in average VEC alone, state whether the sign and magnitude of $\\Delta \\mathrm{VEC}$ would, by electronic concentration alone, favor or disfavor TCP formation.\n\nReport only the numerical value of $\\Delta \\mathrm{VEC}$ as the final answer.

The concept of VEC is a standard and widely used empirical parameter for predicting phase stability in multi-principal-element alloys. The given valence electron counts are the standard values for these elements ($s+d$ electrons for transition metals, outer shell electrons for main group elements). The compositions and modification are realistic.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly stated and provides all necessary information—definitions, compositions, and data—to compute a unique solution for $\\Delta \\mathrm{VEC}$.

It is scientifically sound, formally structured, complete, and feasible.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution proceeds by first calculating the initial VEC, then the final VEC after boron addition, and finally their difference. A symbolic approach is employed for clarity and rigor.\n\nLet the set of the original $N=5$ metallic components be $M = \\{\\mathrm{Co, Cr, Fe, Ni, Mo}\\}$.\n\n**1. Initial Valence Electron Concentration ($\\mathrm{VEC}_{\\text{before B}}$)**\n\nInitially, the alloy is equiatomic, so the atomic fraction of each metallic component is $c_{M} = \\frac{1}{N} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2$.\nThe VEC is calculated as:\n$$ \\mathrm{VEC}_{\\text{before B}} = \\sum_{i \\in M} c_{M} z_{i} = c_{M} \\sum_{i \\in M} z_{i} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i \\in M} z_{i} $$\nLet's define the average valence electron count of the metallic components, $\\bar{z}_{M}$:\n$$ \\bar{z}_{M} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i \\in M} z_{i} = \\frac{z_{\\mathrm{Co}} + z_{\\mathrm{Cr}} + z_{\\mathrm{Fe}} + z_{\\mathrm{Ni}} + z_{\\mathrm{Mo}}}{5} $$\nSubstituting the given values for $z_i$:\n$$ \\bar{z}_{M} = \\frac{9 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 6}{5} = \\frac{39}{5} = 7.8 $$\nThus, the initial VEC is simply the average valence electron count of the metallic base:\n$$ \\mathrm{VEC}_{\\text{before B}} = \\bar{z}_{M} = 7.8 $$\n\n**2. Final Valence Electron Concentration ($\\mathrm{VEC}_{\\text{after B}}$)**\n\nAfter adding boron, the atomic fraction of boron is $c_{\\mathrm{B}} = 0.005$. The new atomic fraction for each of the $N=5$ metallic components is $c'_{M} = \\frac{1 - c_{\\mathrm{B}}}{N}$.\nThe VEC of the modified alloy is:\n$$ \\mathrm{VEC}_{\\text{after B}} = \\left(\\sum_{i \\in M} c'_{M} z_{i}\\right) + c_{\\mathrm{B}} z_{\\mathrm{B}} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{VEC}_{\\text{after B}} = c'_{M} \\left(\\sum_{i \\in M} z_{i}\\right) + c_{\\mathrm{B}} z_{\\mathrm{B}} = \\left(\\frac{1 - c_{\\mathrm{B}}}{N}\\right) \\left(\\sum_{i \\in M} z_{i}\\right) + c_{\\mathrm{B}} z_{\\mathrm{B}} $$\nUsing the definition $\\bar{z}_{M} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i \\in M} z_{i}$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$ \\mathrm{VEC}_{\\text{after B}} = (1 - c_{\\mathrm{B}}) \\bar{z}_{M} + c_{\\mathrm{B}} z_{\\mathrm{B}} $$\n\n**3. Change in Valence Electron Concentration ($\\Delta \\mathrm{VEC}$)**\n\nThe change in VEC is the difference between the final and initial values:\n$$ \\Delta \\mathrm{VEC} = \\mathrm{VEC}_{\\text{after B}} - \\mathrm{VEC}_{\\text{before B}} $$\n$$ \\Delta \\mathrm{VEC} = \\left[ (1 - c_{\\mathrm{B}}) \\bar{z}_{M} + c_{\\mathrm{B}} z_{\\mathrm{B}} \\right] - \\bar{z}_{M} $$\n$$ \\Delta \\mathrm{VEC} = \\bar{z}_{M} - c_{\\mathrm{B}}\\bar{z}_{M} + c_{\\mathrm{B}} z_{\\mathrm{B}} - \\bar{z}_{M} $$\nThis simplifies to a concise expression for the change in VEC:\n$$ \\Delta \\mathrm{VEC} = c_{\\mathrm{B}} (z_{\\mathrm{B}} - \\bar{z}_{M}) $$\nThis result shows that the change in VEC is governed by the amount of the added element ($c_{\\mathrm{B}}$) and the difference between its valence ($z_{\\mathrm{B}}$) and the average valence of the original alloy ($\\bar{z}_{M}$).\n\n**4. Numerical Calculation**\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values into the derived formula:\n- $c_{\\mathrm{B}} = 0.005$\n- $z_{\\mathrm{B}} = 3$\n- $\\bar{z}_{M} = 7.8$\n$$ \\Delta \\mathrm{VEC} = 0.005 \\times (3 - 7.8) = 0.005 \\times (-4.8) = -0.024 $$\n\n**5. Interpretation**\n\nThe calculated change, $\\Delta \\mathrm{VEC} = -0.024$, is negative. The problem states that higher VEC tends to stabilize the face-centered cubic (FCC) solid-solution phase in such alloys. A decrease in VEC, therefore, suggests a decrease in the stability of the FCC phase. Topologically Close-Packed (TCP) phases are intermetallic compounds that are known to compete with, and often form at the expense of, simple solid-solution phases like FCC. Therefore, based on the change in electronic concentration alone, the reduction in VEC would be expected to *favor* the formation of TCP phases by destabilizing the competing FCC matrix.\n\nThe final answer required is the numerical value of $\\Delta \\mathrm{VEC}$, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\Delta \\mathrm{VEC} = -0.02400 $$",

The use of quadratic approximations for free energy surfaces is a standard and valid approach in the context of CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams) modeling, particularly near energy minima. The phases mentioned (FCC solid solution, C14 Laves TCP phase) are common in metallic alloys.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is mathematically well-posed. It involves minimizing a convex function (for a two-phase mixture) subject to linear constraints. The Hessian matrix $\\mathbf{H}$ is symmetric and its determinant is $\\det(\\mathbf{H}) = (2)(1.5) - (0.5)(0.5) = 3 - 0.25 = 2.75  0$, and its trace is $2+1.5 = 3.5  0$, so it is positive-definite. This ensures that the free energy surfaces are convex parabolas with unique minima, guaranteeing a unique solution for the equilibrium state.\n3.  **Objective**:  The problem is stated using precise mathematical language and objective, verifiable data. There are no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n4.  **Self-Contained and Consistent**: All necessary constants, functional forms, and conditions are provided. There are no internal contradictions.\n5.  **Relevant**: The problem is squarely within the specified topic of intermetallic and TCP phase formation in complex alloys.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous solution will be developed.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing multiphase equilibrium at constant temperature and pressure is the minimization of the total Gibbs free energy of the system. For a two-phase mixture of phases $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ with an overall composition $\\boldsymbol{c}^{0}$, the total free energy per mole is given by $g_{total} = f_{\\alpha} g^{\\alpha}(\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha}) + f_{\\beta} g^{\\beta}(\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\beta})$, where $f_{\\alpha}$ and $f_{\\beta}$ are the molar fractions of the phases, and $\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha}$ and $\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\beta}$ are their respective compositions.\n\nThe equilibrium state is found by minimizing $g_{total}$ with respect to $f_{\\alpha}$, $\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha}$, and $\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\beta}$ subject to the constraints of mass balance:\n$1.$ Mole fraction conservation: $f_{\\alpha} + f_{\\beta} = 1$\n$2.$ Component conservation (lever rule): $f_{\\alpha} \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha} + f_{\\beta} \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\beta} = \\boldsymbol{c}^{0}$\n\nUsing $f_{\\beta} = 1 - f_{\\alpha}$, the objective function and the lever rule become:\n$g_{total}(f_{\\alpha}, \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha}, \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\beta}) = f_{\\alpha} g^{\\alpha}(\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha}) + (1 - f_{\\alpha}) g^{\\beta}(\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\beta})$\n$\\boldsymbol{c}^{0} - \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\beta} = f_{\\alpha} (\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\beta})$\n\nThe conditions for equilibrium are derived from the geometric interpretation of this minimization, known as the common tangent plane construction. This requires that the tangent planes to the free energy surfaces $g^{\\alpha}$ and $g^{\\beta}$ at the equilibrium compositions $\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha}$ and $\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\beta}$ must be identical. This implies two conditions:\n$1.$ The gradients of the free energy functions must be equal. This gradient vector is related to the chemical potentials.\n$$ \\nabla g^{\\alpha}(\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha}) = \\nabla g^{\\beta}(\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\beta}) $$\n$2.$ The tangent planes must have the same intercept. This can be written as:\n$$ g^{\\alpha}(\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha}) - \\nabla g^{\\alpha}(\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha}) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha} = g^{\\beta}(\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\beta}) - \\nabla g^{\\beta}(\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\beta}) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\beta} $$\nThis second condition can be rearranged, using the first, to $g^{\\alpha}(\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha}) - g^{\\beta}(\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\beta}) = \\nabla g^{\\alpha}(\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha}) \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\beta})$.\n\nFor the given quadratic free energy forms, the gradient is $\\nabla g^{\\phi}(\\boldsymbol{c}) = \\mathbf{H}(\\boldsymbol{c} - \\boldsymbol{m}_{\\phi})$, since $\\mathbf{H}$ is symmetric.\n\nApplying the first equilibrium condition:\n$$ \\mathbf{H}(\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{m}_{\\alpha}) = \\mathbf{H}(\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\beta} - \\boldsymbol{m}_{\\beta}) $$\nSince $\\mathbf{H}$ is positive-definite, it is invertible. Multiplying by $\\mathbf{H}^{-1}$ gives:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{m}_{\\alpha} = \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\beta} - \\boldsymbol{m}_{\\beta} $$\nRearranging this equation reveals a crucial property for this specific model:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\beta} = \\boldsymbol{m}_{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{m}_{\\beta} $$\nThis result shows that the equilibrium tie-line vector, $\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\beta}$, is equal to the vector connecting the minima of the two free energy surfaces, $\\boldsymbol{m}_{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{m}_{\\beta}$. This is a direct consequence of the assumption that both phases have the same Hessian matrix $\\mathbf{H}$.\n\nNow, we apply the second equilibrium condition. Let $\\boldsymbol{\\Delta m} = \\boldsymbol{m}_{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{m}_{\\beta}$.\n$g^{\\alpha}(\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha}) - g^{\\beta}(\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\beta}) = (\\mathbf{H}(\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{m}_{\\alpha}))^{\\mathrm{T}} (\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\beta})$.\nThe left-hand side is:\n$g_{0}^{\\alpha} + \\frac{1}{2}(\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{m}_{\\alpha})^{\\mathrm{T}} \\mathbf{H} (\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{m}_{\\alpha}) - g_{0}^{\\beta} - \\frac{1}{2}(\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\beta} - \\boldsymbol{m}_{\\beta})^{\\mathrm{T}} \\mathbf{H} (\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\beta} - \\boldsymbol{m}_{\\beta})$\nFrom $\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{m}_{\\alpha} = \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\beta} - \\boldsymbol{m}_{\\beta}$, the two quadratic terms are identical and cancel out. The left-hand side simplifies to $g_{0}^{\\alpha} - g_{0}^{\\beta}$.\nThe right-hand side is $(\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{m}_{\\alpha})^{\\mathrm{T}} \\mathbf{H} (\\boldsymbol{m}_{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{m}_{\\beta})$.\nEquating the simplified sides gives a linear equation for $\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha}$:\n$$ g_{0}^{\\alpha} - g_{0}^{\\beta} = (\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{m}_{\\alpha})^{\\mathrm{T}} \\mathbf{H} (\\boldsymbol{m}_{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{m}_{\\beta}) $$\n\nTo solve for $\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha}$, we need a second relationship. The overall composition $\\boldsymbol{c}^0$ must lie on the tie-line segment connecting $\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha}$ and $\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\beta}$. This means the three points are collinear, and the vector $\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{c}^0$ must be parallel to the tie-line vector $\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\beta} = \\boldsymbol{\\Delta m}$. Thus, we can write:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{c}^{0} = k \\boldsymbol{\\Delta m} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha} = \\boldsymbol{c}^0 + k \\boldsymbol{\\Delta m} $$\nfor some scalar $k$. We can now substitute this expression for $\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha}$ into the simplified intercept equation to find $k$.\n\nFirst, we compute the necessary vectors and products with the given data:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\Delta m} = \\boldsymbol{m}_{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{m}_{\\beta} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.36 \\\\ 0.34 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 0.24 \\\\ 0.58 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.12 \\\\ -0.24 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\mathbf{H} \\boldsymbol{\\Delta m} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2  0.5 \\\\ 0.5  1.5 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.12 \\\\ -0.24 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2(0.12) + 0.5(-0.24) \\\\ 0.5(0.12) + 1.5(-0.24) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.24 - 0.12 \\\\ 0.06 - 0.36 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.12 \\\\ -0.30 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe intercept equation $g_{0}^{\\alpha} - g_{0}^{\\beta} = (\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{m}_{\\alpha})^{\\mathrm{T}} (\\mathbf{H} \\boldsymbol{\\Delta m})$ becomes:\n$$ 0.02 - 0.00 = ((\\boldsymbol{c}^0 + k \\boldsymbol{\\Delta m}) - \\boldsymbol{m}_{\\alpha})^{\\mathrm{T}} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.12 \\\\ -0.30 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ 0.02 = (\\boldsymbol{c}^0 - \\boldsymbol{m}_{\\alpha} + k \\boldsymbol{\\Delta m})^{\\mathrm{T}} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.12 \\\\ -0.30 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nLet's compute the vectors inside the parenthesis:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{c}^0 - \\boldsymbol{m}_{\\alpha} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.30 \\\\ 0.45 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 0.36 \\\\ 0.34 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -0.06 \\\\ 0.11 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe equation becomes:\n$$ 0.02 = \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} -0.06 \\\\ 0.11 \\end{pmatrix} + k \\begin{pmatrix} 0.12 \\\\ -0.24 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)^{\\mathrm{T}} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.12 \\\\ -0.30 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ 0.02 = (-0.06 + 0.12k)(0.12) + (0.11 - 0.24k)(-0.30) $$\n$$ 0.02 = -0.0072 + 0.0144k - 0.033 + 0.072k $$\n$$ 0.02 = -0.0402 + 0.0864k $$\n$$ 0.0602 = 0.0864k $$\n$$ k = \\frac{0.0602}{0.0864} = \\frac{301}{432} \\approx 0.696759 $$\n\nWith $k$, we can find the equilibrium compositions:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha} = \\boldsymbol{c}^0 + k \\boldsymbol{\\Delta m} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.30 \\\\ 0.45 \\end{pmatrix} + \\frac{301}{432} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.12 \\\\ -0.24 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.30 + 0.083611... \\\\ 0.45 - 0.167222... \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.383611... \\\\ 0.282777... \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\beta} = \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{\\Delta m} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.383611... \\\\ 0.282777... \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 0.12 \\\\ -0.24 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.263611... \\\\ 0.522777... \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nFinally, we find the phase fractions using the lever rule, $\\boldsymbol{c}^0 = f_{\\alpha} \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha} + f_{\\beta} \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\beta}$.\nFrom $\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{c}^0 = k\\boldsymbol{\\Delta m}$ and the lever rule $\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{c}^0 = f_{\\beta}(\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\beta}) = f_{\\beta} \\boldsymbol{\\Delta m}$, it is evident that $f_{\\beta} = k$.\n$$ f_{\\beta} = k = \\frac{301}{432} \\approx 0.696759 $$\nAnd $f_{\\alpha} = 1 - f_{\\beta}$:\n$$ f_{\\alpha} = 1 - \\frac{301}{432} = \\frac{131}{432} \\approx 0.303241 $$\n\nRounding the results to four significant figures:\n$c_A^{\\alpha} \\approx 0.3836$\n$c_B^{\\alpha} \\approx 0.2828$\n$c_A^{\\beta} \\approx 0.2636$\n$c_B^{\\beta} \\approx 0.5228$\n$f_{\\alpha} \\approx 0.3032$\n$f_{\\beta} \\approx 0.6968$\n\nThe final result is the row vector $(c_A^{\\alpha},\\,c_B^{\\alpha},\\,c_A^{\\beta},\\,c_B^{\\beta},\\,f_{\\alpha},\\,f_{\\beta})$.",
