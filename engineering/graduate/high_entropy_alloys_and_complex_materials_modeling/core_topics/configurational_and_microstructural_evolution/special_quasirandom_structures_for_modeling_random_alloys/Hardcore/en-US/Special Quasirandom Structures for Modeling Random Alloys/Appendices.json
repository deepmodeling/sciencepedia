            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It addresses core concepts from the theory of cluster expansion in materials science.\n\nThe problem asks for two tasks: first, to construct a set of basis functions with specific properties, and second, to compute a two-site correlation expectation using these functions.\n\nFirst, let us clarify the notation. The problem uses angle brackets for two distinct purposes. The notation $\\langle f, g \\rangle$ represents a composition-weighted inner product between two single-site functions $f(s)$ and $g(s)$, defined as:\n$$\n\\langle f, g \\rangle = \\sum_{s=1}^{5} p_{s} f(s) g(s)\n$$\nwhere $p_{s} = \\frac{1}{5}$ for $s \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. The notation $\\left\\langle \\dots \\right\\rangle$ in the context of $\\left\\langle \\gamma^{(a)}(s_{i}) \\, \\gamma^{(b)}(s_{j}) \\right\\rangle$ denotes a statistical expectation value (configurational average) over the distribution of atomic species on the lattice sites.\n\n**Part 1: Construction of Orthonormal Basis Functions**\n\nWe need to construct a set of four real-valued functions $\\{\\gamma^{(a)}(s)\\}_{a=1}^{4}$ that are orthonormal with respect to the given inner product and have a zero composition-weighted mean. The space of all functions on the set of five species is a $5$-dimensional vector space. The constant function, $\\gamma^{(0)}(s) = 1$, is one basis vector. Its norm is $\\langle 1, 1 \\rangle = \\sum_{s=1}^5 p_s (1)^2 = \\sum_{s=1}^5 \\frac{1}{5} = 1$. The remaining four basis functions must be orthogonal to $\\gamma^{(0)}(s)$. This orthogonality condition is precisely the condition of having a zero composition-weighted mean:\n$$\n\\langle \\gamma^{(a)}, 1 \\rangle = \\sum_{s=1}^{5} p_{s} \\gamma^{(a)}(s) (1) = \\frac{1}{5} \\sum_{s=1}^{5} \\gamma^{(a)}(s) = 0 \\quad \\text{for } a \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}\n$$\nThe orthonormality condition for the set $\\{\\gamma^{(a)}(s)\\}_{a=1}^{4}$ is:\n$$\n\\langle \\gamma^{(a)}, \\gamma^{(b)} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{5} \\sum_{s=1}^{5} \\gamma^{(a)}(s) \\gamma^{(b)}(s) = \\delta_{ab} \\quad \\text{for } a,b \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}\n$$\nwhere $\\delta_{ab}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nWe can construct such a set using a procedure analogous to the Gram-Schmidt process, starting with functions involving Kronecker deltas $\\delta_{sk}$. A systematic and common construction is as follows:\nDefine a sequence of unnormalized functions $f^{(k)}(s)$ for $k=1, 2, 3, 4$:\n$$\nf^{(k)}(s) = \\sum_{j=1}^{k} \\delta_{sj} - k \\delta_{s, k+1}\n$$\nBy construction, each $f^{(k)}(s)$ has a zero mean: $\\sum_{s=1}^{5} f^{(k)}(s) = k \\cdot 1 - k \\cdot 1 = 0$. These functions are mutually orthogonal. For example, consider $f^{(1)}(s) = \\delta_{s1} - \\delta_{s2}$ and $f^{(2)}(s) = \\delta_{s1} + \\delta_{s2} - 2\\delta_{s3}$. Their inner product is:\n$$\n\\langle f^{(1)}, f^{(2)} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{5} \\sum_s (\\delta_{s1} - \\delta_{s2})(\\delta_{s1} + \\delta_{s2} - 2\\delta_{s3}) = \\frac{1}{5} \\left( (1)(1) + (-1)(1) \\right) = 0\n$$\nTo obtain the final orthonormal basis functions $\\gamma^{(a)}(s)$, we normalize each $f^{(a)}(s)$. The squared norm is $\\langle f^{(k)}, f^{(k)} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{5}\\sum_s (f^{(k)}(s))^2$.\nFor $f^{(1)}(s) = \\delta_{s1} - \\delta_{s2}$, $\\langle f^{(1)}, f^{(1)} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{5} (1^2 + (-1)^2) = \\frac{2}{5}$.\nFor $f^{(2)}(s) = \\delta_{s1} + \\delta_{s2} - 2\\delta_{s3}$, $\\langle f^{(2)}, f^{(2)} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{5} (1^2 + 1^2 + (-2)^2) = \\frac{6}{5}$.\nIn general, for a quinary system ($N=5$), the squared norm is $\\langle f^{(k)}, f^{(k)} \\rangle = \\frac{k(k+1)}{5}$.\nThe normalization constant is $C_k = 1 / \\sqrt{\\langle f^{(k)}, f^{(k)} \\rangle} = \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{k(k+1)}}$.\nThis yields the explicit orthonormal set:\n$$\n\\gamma^{(1)}(s) = \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}} (\\delta_{s1} - \\delta_{s2})\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma^{(2)}(s) = \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{6}} (\\delta_{s1} + \\delta_{s2} - 2\\delta_{s3})\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma^{(3)}(s) = \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{12}} (\\delta_{s1} + \\delta_{s2} + \\delta_{s3} - 3\\delta_{s4})\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma^{(4)}(s) = \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{20}} (\\delta_{s1} + \\delta_{s2} + \\delta_{s3} + \\delta_{s4} - 4\\delta_{s5}) = \\frac{1}{2} (\\delta_{s1} + \\delta_{s2} + \\delta_{s3} + \\delta_{s4} - 4\\delta_{s5})\n$$\nThis set satisfies all the required properties.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Two-Site Correlation Expectation**\n\nWe are asked to compute the two-site correlation expectation $\\left\\langle \\gamma^{(a)}(s_{i}) \\, \\gamma^{(b)}(s_{j}) \\right\\rangle$ for two distinct sites $i \\neq j$. The problem states that the alloy is random with uniform probabilities and that occupations of distinct sites are independent.\n\nThe expectation value is calculated by averaging over all possible configurations of species on sites $i$ and $j$. Due to independence, the joint probability distribution for species $s_i$ on site $i$ and $s_j$ on site $j$ is the product of the individual probabilities: $p(s_i, s_j) = p(s_i) p(s_j)$.\nThe expectation value is therefore:\n$$\n\\left\\langle \\gamma^{(a)}(s_{i}) \\, \\gamma^{(b)}(s_{j}) \\right\\rangle = \\sum_{s_i=1}^{5} \\sum_{s_j=1}^{5} p(s_i) p(s_j) \\gamma^{(a)}(s_{i}) \\gamma^{(b)}(s_{j})\n$$\nBecause the summand is a product of a function of $s_i$ and a function of $s_j$, the double summation can be factored into a product of two single summations:\n$$\n\\left\\langle \\gamma^{(a)}(s_{i}) \\, \\gamma^{(b)}(s_{j}) \\right\\rangle = \\left( \\sum_{s_i=1}^{5} p(s_i) \\gamma^{(a)}(s_{i}) \\right) \\left( \\sum_{s_j=1}^{5} p(s_j) \\gamma^{(b)}(s_{j}) \\right)\n$$\nEach factor in this product is the single-site expectation value of a basis function. Let's examine one such factor:\n$$\n\\sum_{s=1}^{5} p(s) \\gamma^{(a)}(s)\n$$\nThis expression is exactly the composition-weighted mean of the function $\\gamma^{(a)}(s)$. The problem statement explicitly requires the basis functions $\\{\\gamma^{(a)}(s)\\}_{a=1}^4$ to have a \"zero composition-weighted mean\". As shown earlier, this is equivalent to the basis functions being orthogonal to the constant function $\\gamma^{(0)}(s)=1$:\n$$\n\\sum_{s=1}^{5} p(s) \\gamma^{(a)}(s) = \\langle \\gamma^{(a)}, 1 \\rangle = 0 \\quad \\text{for } a \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}\n$$\nSimilarly, for the function $\\gamma^{(b)}(s)$, its composition-weighted mean is also zero:\n$$\n\\sum_{s=1}^{5} p(s) \\gamma^{(b)}(s) = \\langle \\gamma^{(b)}, 1 \\rangle = 0 \\quad \\text{for } b \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}\n$$\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for the two-site correlation:\n$$\n\\left\\langle \\gamma^{(a)}(s_{i}) \\, \\gamma^{(b)}(s_{j}) \\right\\rangle = (0) \\cdot (0) = 0\n$$\nThis result holds for any choice of $a, b \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ and for any pair of distinct sites $i \\neq j$. The result is a direct consequence of the defining properties of the cluster expansion basis functions for a random alloy and does not depend on the specific explicit construction of these functions, only that they are orthogonal to the constant function.",

            "problem": "You are given a one-dimensional periodic lattice (a ring) of $L$ sites populated by a quinary equiatomic alloy, meaning there are $5$ distinct species and the composition is $1/5$ for each species. In Special Quasirandom Structures (SQS), one represents species by pseudospin vectors so that correlation functions in finite cells match those of an ideal, completely random alloy. The purpose of this problem is to compute pair and triplet pseudospin correlations for concrete SQS configurations and verify, via a numerical check, their agreement with the random equiatomic targets.\n\nFundamental base and definitions:\n- Special Quasirandom Structures (SQS) are finite periodic arrangements designed to reproduce, as closely as possible, the correlation functions of a random alloy. A quinary alloy has $5$ species with equal probability $1/5$ at each site.\n- Let the species set be $\\{\\sigma=0,1,2,3,4\\}$. Define the pseudospin vector for species $\\sigma$ by placing the $5$ standard basis vectors $\\mathbf{e}_\\sigma$ in $\\mathbb{R}^5$ and subtracting the centroid $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}=\\frac{1}{5}\\sum_{\\sigma=0}^{4}\\mathbf{e}_\\sigma$.

Each parameter set is a tuple $(L, \\text{config}, \\varepsilon_{\\text{pair},1}, \\varepsilon_{\\text{pair},2}, \\varepsilon_{\\text{triplet}})$, where the configuration is a list of species labels $\\sigma_i\\in\\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$ of length $L$.\n1.

            "solution": "The user-provided problem is a well-defined computational task in the field of computational materials science, specifically concerning the validation of Special Quasirandom Structures (SQS). The problem is scientifically grounded, mathematically consistent, and all necessary parameters and definitions are provided. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution can be formulated.\n\nThe core of the problem is to compute pair and triplet correlation functions for given atomic configurations on a one-dimensional periodic lattice and to compare them against the theoretical values for a perfectly random alloy.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the representation of the atomic species. A quinary alloy consists of $N=5$ distinct species, which we can label with integers $\\sigma \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. In the SQS formalism, each species $\\sigma$ is mapped to a pseudospin vector $\\mathbf{s}(\\sigma)$ in an $N$-dimensional space ($\\mathbb{R}^5$). These vectors are constructed to have specific orthogonality properties that mimic statistical independence. The construction begins with the standard basis vectors $\\mathbf{e}_\\sigma \\in \\mathbb{R}^5$, where $\\mathbf{e}_\\sigma$ is a vector with $1$ in the $\\sigma$-th position and $0$ elsewhere. For an equiatomic alloy, the probability of finding any species at a site is $p_\\sigma=1/N = 1/5$. The pseudospin vectors are centered by subtracting the centroid of the basis vectors, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\mu} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{\\sigma=0}^{N-1} \\mathbf{e}_\\sigma = \\left(\\frac{1}{5}, \\frac{1}{5}, \\frac{1}{5}, \\frac{1}{5}, \\frac{1}{5}\\right)^T\n$$\nThe pseudospin vector for species $\\sigma$ is then:\n$$\n\\mathbf{s}(\\sigma) = \\mathbf{e}_\\sigma - \\boldsymbol{\\mu}\n$$\nFor a given lattice configuration, specified by a sequence of species labels $(\\sigma_0, \\sigma_1, \\dots, \\sigma_{L-1})$, each site $i$ is assigned the corresponding pseudospin vector $\\mathbf{s}_i = \\mathbf{s}(\\sigma_i)$.\n\nThe properties of these vectors are crucial. The dot product between two such vectors is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{s}(\\sigma) \\cdot \\mathbf{s}(\\tau) = (\\mathbf{e}_\\sigma - \\boldsymbol{\\mu}) \\cdot (\\mathbf{e}_\\tau - \\boldsymbol{\\mu}) = \\mathbf{e}_\\sigma \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_\\tau - \\mathbf{e}_\\sigma \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\mu} - \\mathbf{e}_\\tau \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\mu} + \\boldsymbol{\\mu} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\mu}\n$$\nUsing $\\mathbf{e}_\\sigma \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_\\tau = \\delta_{\\sigma\\tau}$ (the Kronecker delta), $\\mathbf{e}_\\sigma \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\mu} = 1/N$, and $\\boldsymbol{\\mu} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\mu} = N(1/N^2) = 1/N$, we get:\n$$\n\\mathbf{s}(\\sigma) \\cdot \\mathbf{s}(\\tau) = \\delta_{\\sigma\\tau} - \\frac{1}{N} - \\frac{1}{N} + \\frac{1}{N} = \\delta_{\\sigma\\tau} - \\frac{1}{N}\n$$\nFor our case, $N=5$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{s}(\\sigma) \\cdot \\mathbf{s}(\\tau) =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 - 1/5 = 4/5  \\text{if } \\sigma = \\tau \\\\\n-1/5  \\text{if } \\sigma \\neq \\tau\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThese values are the foundation for calculating the pair correlation functions.\n\nThe problem asks for two types of correlation functions to be computed for a lattice of length $L$ with periodic boundary conditions.\n\n1.  **Pair Correlation Function, $C_2(R)$**: This measures the average correlation between pairs of sites separated by a distance $R$ along the ring.\n    $$\n    C_2(R) = \\frac{1}{L} \\sum_{i=0}^{L-1} \\mathbf{s}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{s}_{(i+R) \\bmod L}\n    $$\n    We need to compute this for first ($R=1$) and second ($R=2$) nearest neighbors. For a given configuration, we map the species list to a sequence of pseudospin vectors. Then, for each $R$, we compute the dot product for each pair $(i, (i+R)\\bmod L)$, sum these products, and divide by $L$.\n\n2.  **Triplet Correlation Function, $C_3$**: This measures the average correlation among triplets of adjacent sites.\n    $$\n    C_3 = \\frac{1}{L} \\sum_{i=0}^{L-1} \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{5} s_i^{\\alpha}\\,s_{(i+1)\\bmod L}^{\\alpha}\\,s_{(i+2)\\bmod L}^{\\alpha}\n    $$\n    Here, $s_i^{\\alpha}$ is the $\\alpha$-th component of the vector $\\mathbf{s}_i$. The calculation involves, for each starting site $i$, taking the three consecutive pseudospin vectors $\\mathbf{s}_i$, $\\mathbf{s}_{(i+1)\\bmod L}$, and $\\mathbf{s}_{(i+2)\\bmod L}$, computing their element-wise product, summing the components of the resulting vector, and finally averaging these sums over all possible starting sites $i$.\n\nThe target for a perfectly random alloy is $C_2(R)=0$ and $C_3=0$. The numerical verification protocol involves checking if the absolute value of the computed correlations falls within specified tolerances: $|C_2(R)| \\le \\varepsilon_{\\text{pair},R}$ and $|C_3| \\le \\varepsilon_{\\text{triplet}}$.\n\nThe overall algorithm proceeds as follows for each test case:\n1.  Define the number of species $N=5$. Construct the $5 \\times 5$ matrix of pseudospin vectors, where the $\\sigma$-th row is the vector $\\mathbf{s}(\\sigma)$.\n2.  Given a configuration of length $L$, create an $L \\times 5$ matrix representing the sequence of pseudospin vectors on the lattice.\n3.  To compute $C_2(R)$, create a copy of the lattice spin matrix and roll it cylindrically by $-R$ sites. Element-wise multiply the original and rolled matrices and sum all elements of the resulting matrix. Divide by $L$.\n4.  To compute $C_3$, create two rolled copies of the lattice spin matrix, one rolled by $-1$ and the other by $-2$. Element-wise multiply the original and the two rolled matrices. Sum all elements of the final product and divide by $L$.\n5.  Compare the absolute values of the computed $C_2(1)$, $C_2(2)$, and $C_3$ with their respective tolerances to produce three boolean results.\n6.  Concatenate the boolean results from all test cases into a single list for the final output.\n\nThis process will be implemented in Python using the `numpy` library for efficient array operations.",

The exact composition constraint is enforced in the cell: $N_{A}=1$ and $N_{B}=1$, which implies $\\sigma_{A} \\in \\{+1,-1\\}$ and $\\sigma_{B}=-\\sigma_{A}$.\n\nDefine the first-shell and second-shell pair correlation averages as\n$$\\Pi^{(1)}=\\frac{1}{M_{1}}\\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle_{1}}\\sigma_{i}\\sigma_{j},\\qquad \\Pi^{(2)}=\\frac{1}{M_{2}}\\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle_{2}}\\sigma_{i}\\sigma_{j},$$\nwhere $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ are the numbers of first-shell and second-shell pairs in the periodic cell, and $\\langle i,j \\rangle_{s}$ denotes pairs at shell $s$.\n\nThe SQS target for the random alloy at equiatomic composition is $\\Pi_{\\text{rand}}^{(1)}=0$ and $\\Pi_{\\text{rand}}^{(2)}=0$. Using only the exact composition counts and the lattice connectivity of the honeycomb primitive cell, demonstrate whether it is possible to simultaneously achieve $\\Pi^{(1)}=0$ and $\\Pi^{(2)}=0$ in this $N=2$ supercell. Then, define the two-shell objective\n$$F\\equiv\\left(\\Pi^{(1)}-\\Pi_{\\text{rand}}^{(1)}\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\Pi^{(2)}-\\Pi_{\\text{rand}}^{(2)}\\right)^{2},$$\nand compute the minimal achievable value $F_{\\min}$ under the exact composition constraint. Express your final answer as an exact number. No units are required. No rounding is necessary.",
            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of the pair correlation functions in a specific structural model for a binary alloy and the calculation of an objective function. The first step is to validate the problem statement, which is found to be scientifically sound, well-posed, and free of contradictions. The problem provides a clear description of the lattice, the supercell, the composition, and the definitions required for the calculation.\n\nWe begin by establishing the properties of the system. The model consists of a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice described by a periodic supercell containing $N=2$ sites. These two sites, which we label $1$ and $2$, form the basis of the primitive cell and belong to the two distinct sublattices of the honeycomb structure. Each site $i$ is occupied by an atom of type A or B, represented by an occupational variable $\\sigma_i \\in \\{+1, -1\\}$.\n\nA critical constraint is the exact equiatomic composition within the cell, meaning $N_A=1$ and $N_B=1$. This dictates that one site must have $\\sigma_i = +1$ and the other must have $\\sigma_j = -1$. Let us assign, without loss of generality, $\\sigma_1 = +1$ and $\\sigma_2 = -1$. This choice uniquely determines the configuration of the cell up to a trivial global sign flip which does not affect the pair products. From this assignment, it follows that the product of the occupational variables for the two sites in the basis is $\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 = (1)(-1) = -1$. Furthermore, the square of any occupational variable is $\\sigma_i^2 = (\\pm 1)^2 = 1$.\n\nThe problem defines the pair correlation averages for the first ($s=1$) and second ($s=2$) neighbor shells as:\n$$ \\Pi^{(s)} = \\frac{1}{M_s} \\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle_s} \\sigma_i \\sigma_j $$\nHere, $M_s$ is the number of neighbor pairs of shell $s$ within the periodic cell. Given $N=2$ sites per cell and coordination numbers $z_1=3$ and $z_2=6$, the number of pairs are $M_1 = \\frac{N z_1}{2} = \\frac{2 \\times 3}{2} = 3$ and $M_2 = \\frac{N z_2}{2} = \\frac{2 \\times 6}{2} = 6$.\n\nLet us now compute $\\Pi^{(1)}$. In the honeycomb lattice, first neighbors are always on different sublattices. Since site $1$ and site $2$ are on different sublattices, all $M_1=3$ first-neighbor pairs in the periodic cell are of the type $(1, 2)$. The product of occupational variables for each such pair is $\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2$. Therefore, the sum is:\n$$ \\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle_1} \\sigma_i \\sigma_j = M_1 \\cdot (\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2) = 3 \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 $$\nThe first-shell correlation function is:\n$$ \\Pi^{(1)} = \\frac{3 \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2}{3} = \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 $$\nUsing our assignment, $\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 = -1$, we get:\n$$ \\Pi^{(1)} = -1 $$\n\nNext, we compute $\\Pi^{(2)}$. Second neighbors in the honeycomb lattice are always on the same sublattice. Thus, all second neighbors of site $1$ are equivalent to site $1$ in the periodic lattice, and all second neighbors of site $2$ are equivalent to site $2$. The $M_2=6$ second-neighbor pairs are composed of $M_2/2=3$ pairs of type $(1, 1)$ and $3$ pairs of type $(2, 2)$. The sum becomes:\n$$ \\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle_2} \\sigma_i \\sigma_j = 3 \\cdot (\\sigma_1 \\sigma_1) + 3 \\cdot (\\sigma_2 \\sigma_2) = 3\\sigma_1^2 + 3\\sigma_2^2 $$\nThe second-shell correlation function is:\n$$ \\Pi^{(2)} = \\frac{3\\sigma_1^2 + 3\\sigma_2^2}{6} = \\frac{\\sigma_1^2 + \\sigma_2^2}{2} $$\nUsing the fact that $\\sigma_i^2 = 1$ for all $i$:\n$$ \\Pi^{(2)} = \\frac{1^2 + (-1)^2}{2} = \\frac{1+1}{2} = 1 $$\n\nThe problem asks whether it is possible to simultaneously achieve the SQS target for a random alloy, which is $\\Pi_{\\text{rand}}^{(1)} = 0$ and $\\Pi_{\\text{rand}}^{(2)} = 0$. Our derived values for the given cell are $\\Pi^{(1)} = -1$ and $\\Pi^{(2)} = 1$. Since neither value is zero, it is demonstrably impossible to satisfy the SQS condition for a perfectly random alloy with this small $N=2$ cell. The strict composition constraint on such a small cell forces a state of perfect order, which is maximally different from the target random state.\n\nFinally, we must compute the minimal achievable value $F_{\\min}$ of the objective function:\n$$ F \\equiv \\left(\\Pi^{(1)}-\\Pi_{\\text{rand}}^{(1)}\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\Pi^{(2)}-\\Pi_{\\text{rand}}^{(2)}\\right)^{2} $$\nSubstituting the computed correlation values and the target random-state values:\n$$ F = (-1 - 0)^2 + (1 - 0)^2 $$\n$$ F = (-1)^2 + (1)^2 $$\n$$ F = 1 + 1 = 2 $$\nBecause the problem constraints (cell size, lattice type, composition) lead to a single, unique atomic configuration (up to symmetry), there is only one possible set of correlation values. Consequently, the value of $F$ is fixed. The minimal value $F_{\\min}$ is therefore this single achievable value.\n$$ F_{\\min} = 2 $$",
