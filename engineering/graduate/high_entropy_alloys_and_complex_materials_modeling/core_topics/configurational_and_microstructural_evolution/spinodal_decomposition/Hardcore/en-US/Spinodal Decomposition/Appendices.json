The solution process may proceed.\n\n---\n\nThe spinodal boundary is defined as the set of compositions and temperatures for which the free energy surface has zero curvature with respect to composition. This indicates the limit of stability of a homogeneous phase against infinitesimal composition fluctuations. Mathematically, this condition is expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2f}{dc^2} = 0\n$$\nWe begin with the given expression for the free energy per lattice site:\n$$\nf(c) = \\Omega c(1-c) + k_B T [c \\ln c + (1-c) \\ln(1-c)]\n$$\nTo find the spinodal compositions, we must compute the second derivative of $f(c)$ with respect to $c$. First, we compute the first derivative, $\\frac{df}{dc}$:\n$$\n\\frac{df}{dc} = \\frac{d}{dc} \\left( \\Omega c - \\Omega c^2 \\right) + k_B T \\frac{d}{dc} \\left[ c \\ln c + (1-c) \\ln(1-c) \\right]\n$$\nThe derivative of the enthalpic term is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dc} \\left( \\Omega c - \\Omega c^2 \\right) = \\Omega - 2\\Omega c = \\Omega(1-2c)\n$$\nThe derivative of the entropic term is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dc} \\left[ c \\ln c + (1-c) \\ln(1-c) \\right] = \\left( 1 \\cdot \\ln c + c \\cdot \\frac{1}{c} \\right) + \\left( -1 \\cdot \\ln(1-c) + (1-c) \\cdot \\frac{-1}{1-c} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n= (\\ln c + 1) + (-\\ln(1-c) - 1) = \\ln c - \\ln(1-c) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{c}{1-c}\\right)\n$$\nCombining these results, the first derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{df}{dc} = \\Omega(1-2c) + k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{c}{1-c}\\right)\n$$\nNext, we compute the second derivative, $\\frac{d^2f}{dc^2}$, by differentiating $\\frac{df}{dc}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2f}{dc^2} = \\frac{d}{dc} \\left[ \\Omega(1-2c) \\right] + k_B T \\frac{d}{dc} \\left[ \\ln c - \\ln(1-c) \\right]\n$$\nThe derivative of the first term is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dc} \\left[ \\Omega(1-2c) \\right] = -2\\Omega\n$$\nThe derivative of the second term is:\n$$\nk_B T \\left( \\frac{1}{c} - \\frac{-1}{1-c} \\right) = k_B T \\left( \\frac{1}{c} + \\frac{1}{1-c} \\right) = k_B T \\left( \\frac{1-c+c}{c(1-c)} \\right) = \\frac{k_B T}{c(1-c)}\n$$\nThus, the second derivative of the free energy is:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2f}{dc^2} = -2\\Omega + \\frac{k_B T}{c(1-c)}\n$$\nTo find the spinodal compositions, we set this expression to zero:\n$$\n-2\\Omega + \\frac{k_B T}{c(1-c)} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{k_B T}{c(1-c)} = 2\\Omega\n$$\nRearranging this equation gives a quadratic equation for the composition $c$:\n$$\nc(1-c) = \\frac{k_B T}{2\\Omega}\n$$\n$$\nc - c^2 = \\frac{k_B T}{2\\Omega}\n$$\n$$\nc^2 - c + \\frac{k_B T}{2\\Omega} = 0\n$$\nWe solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, $c = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac_{q}}}{2a}$, where $a=1$, $b=-1$, and $c_{q}=\\frac{k_B T}{2\\Omega}$:\n$$\nc = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(1)\\left(\\frac{k_B T}{2\\Omega}\\right)}}{2(1)}\n$$\n$$\nc = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{2k_B T}{\\Omega}}}{2}\n$$\nThese two solutions represent the boundaries of the spinodal region, $c_{-}(T)$ and $c_{+}(T)$:\n$$\nc_{-}(T) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 - \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{2k_B T}{\\Omega}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nc_{+}(T) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 + \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{2k_B T}{\\Omega}}\\right)\n$$\nThe width of the unstable composition interval is $\\Delta c(T) = c_{+}(T) - c_{-}(T)$:\n$$\n\\Delta c(T) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 + \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{2k_B T}{\\Omega}}\\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 - \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{2k_B T}{\\Omega}}\\right) = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{2k_B T}{\\Omega}}\n$$\nAs temperature $T$ increases, the term $\\frac{2k_B T}{\\Omega}$ increases, causing the term under the square root, $1 - \\frac{2k_B T}{\\Omega}$, to decrease. Consequently, the width of the unstable interval, $\\Delta c(T)$, decreases as temperature increases.\n\nThe unstable compositions exist only when the solutions for $c$ are real and distinct. This requires the discriminant of the quadratic equation to be positive:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{2k_B T}{\\Omega}  0 \\implies 1  \\frac{2k_B T}{\\Omega} \\implies T  \\frac{\\Omega}{2k_B}\n$$\nThe upper limit for the existence of an unstable region is the critical temperature, $T_c$, at which the discriminant is zero. Above this temperature, the discriminant is negative, resulting in no real solutions for $c$, which means $\\frac{d^2f}{dc^2}  0$ for all compositions and the system is stable/miscible everywhere. We find $T_c$ by setting the discriminant to zero:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{2k_B T_c}{\\Omega} = 0 \\implies T_c = \\frac{\\Omega}{2k_B}\n$$\nTherefore, no unstable compositions exist for any temperature $T  \\frac{\\Omega}{2k_B}$. At $T=T_c$, the two spinodal compositions merge at $c=\\frac{1}{2}$.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the established Cahn-Hilliard theory of spinodal decomposition, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution via linear stability analysis, and formulated with objective, precise language. All provided parameters are physically consistent within the theoretical framework. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe evolution of the concentration field $c(\\mathbf{x},t)$ is governed by the Cahn-Hilliard equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\cdot (M \\nabla \\mu)\n$$\nwhere $M  0$ is the constant atomic mobility and $\\mu$ is the chemical potential. The chemical potential is derived from the variational derivative of the total free energy functional $F[c]$:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta c} = \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta c} \\int_{\\Omega} \\left( f(c,T) + \\frac{\\kappa}{2} |\\nabla c|^2 \\right)\\, \\mathrm{d}V\n$$\nUsing the Euler-Lagrange equation, this derivative is found to be:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial c} - \\kappa \\nabla^2 c\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\mu$ into the Cahn-Hilliard equation, assuming constant mobility $M$, yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = M \\nabla^2 \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial c} - \\kappa \\nabla^2 c \\right) = M \\left( \\nabla^2 \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial c}\\right) - \\kappa \\nabla^4 c \\right)\n$$\nTo analyze the early stages of phase separation, we perform a linear stability analysis around the homogeneous state $c(\\mathbf{x}, t) = c_0$. Let the concentration be a small perturbation $\\delta c(\\mathbf{x},t)$ away from the average composition $c_0$:\n$$\nc(\\mathbf{x},t) = c_0 + \\delta c(\\mathbf{x},t)\n$$\nWe linearize the $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial c}$ term by expanding it in a Taylor series around $c_0$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial c}(c) \\approx \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial c}\\bigg|_{c_0} + \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial c^2}\\bigg|_{c_0} (c - c_0)\n$$\nFrom the given homogeneous free energy density, $f(c,T) = f_0 + \\frac{a(T)}{2}(c-c_0)^2 + \\frac{b}{4}(c-c_0)^4$, we find the derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial c} = a(T)(c-c_0) + b(c-c_0)^3 \\implies \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial c}\\bigg|_{c_0} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial c^2} = a(T) + 3b(c-c_0)^2 \\implies \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial c^2}\\bigg|_{c_0} \\equiv f''(c_0, T) = a(T)\n$$\nThus, the linearized term is $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial c} \\approx a(T) \\delta c$. Substituting this into the Cahn-Hilliard equation and noting that derivatives of constants are zero ($\\partial c_0 / \\partial t = 0$, $\\nabla^n c_0 = 0$), we obtain the linearized Cahn-Hilliard equation for the perturbation $\\delta c$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial (\\delta c)}{\\partial t} = M \\left( a(T) \\nabla^2(\\delta c) - \\kappa \\nabla^4(\\delta c) \\right)\n$$\nWe now analyze the evolution of a single Fourier mode of the perturbation, $\\delta c(\\mathbf{x},t) = \\hat{c}_k(t) e^{i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}}$, where $\\mathbf{k}$ is the wavevector and $k = |\\mathbf{k}|$ is the wavenumber. Applying the spatial derivatives:\n$\\nabla^2 (\\delta c) = -k^2 \\delta c$ and $\\nabla^4 (\\delta c) = k^4 \\delta c$. The linearized equation becomes an ordinary differential equation for the Fourier amplitude $\\hat{c}_k(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\hat{c}_k}{dt} e^{i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}} = M \\left( a(T) (-k^2 \\hat{c}_k) - \\kappa (k^4 \\hat{c}_k) \\right) e^{i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d\\hat{c}_k}{dt} = \\left[ -Mk^2(a(T) + \\kappa k^2) \\right] \\hat{c}_k\n$$\nThis has the solution $\\hat{c}_k(t) = \\hat{c}_k(0) e^{R(k)t}$, where $R(k)$ is the amplification factor:\n$$\nR(k) = -Mk^2(a(T) + \\kappa k^2) = -Mk^2(f''(c_0, T) + \\kappa k^2)\n$$\nSpontaneous phase separation (spinodal decomposition) occurs if fluctuations grow, which requires $R(k)  0$ for some range of $k$. Since $M  0$ and $k^2 \\ge 0$, this condition becomes:\n$$\nf''(c_0, T) + \\kappa k^2  0\n$$\nFor instability to exist, it is necessary that $f''(c_0, T)  0$. This defines the spinodal region. Given $f''(c_0, T) = a(T) = A(T-T_s)$, the condition is $A(T-T_s)  0$. With $A  0$, this means $T  T_s$.\n\nLet's evaluate $f''(c_0, T)$ for the two quench temperatures using the given parameters $A=1$ (in consistent units) and $T_s=1000\\,\\mathrm{K}$:\n- Shallow quench ($T_1 = 980\\,\\mathrm{K}$): $f''(c_0, T_1) = 1 \\cdot (980 - 1000) = -20$.\n- Deep quench ($T_2 = 900\\,\\mathrm{K}$): $f''(c_0, T_2) = 1 \\cdot (900 - 1000) = -100$.\nSince both values are negative, both quenches are within the spinodal region, and instability will occur. The second derivative $f''(c_0,T)$ is indeed more negative for the deeper quench at $T_2$.\n\nNow, we analyze the characteristics of the instability for each case.\n\n1.  **Unstable Wavenumber Band**: The instability condition $f''(c_0, T) + \\kappa k^2  0$ implies $k^2  -f''(c_0, T)/\\kappa$. The unstable wavenumbers lie in the band $0  k  k_c$, where $k_c$ is the cutoff wavenumber:\n    $$\n    k_c = \\sqrt{-\\frac{f''(c_0, T)}{\\kappa}}\n    $$\n    For $T_1=980\\,\\mathrm{K}$: $k_{c,1} = \\sqrt{-(-20)/\\kappa} = \\sqrt{20/\\kappa}$.\n    For $T_2=900\\,\\mathrm{K}$: $k_{c,2} = \\sqrt{-(-100)/\\kappa} = \\sqrt{100/\\kappa}$.\n    Since $100  20$, $k_{c,2}  k_{c,1}$. The unstable band for the deeper quench ($T_2$) extends to larger wavenumbers (shorter wavelengths).\n\n2.  **Fastest-Growing Wavelength**: The early-stage morphology is dominated by the fastest-growing Fourier mode, found by maximizing $R(k)$. We set $\\frac{dR(k)}{dk} = 0$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d}{dk} \\left[-Mk^2(f''(c_0, T) + \\kappa k^2)\\right] = -M[2k f''(c_0, T) + 4\\kappa k^3] = 0\n    $$\n    For $k \\neq 0$, we have $2f''(c_0, T) + 4\\kappa k^2 = 0$, which gives the wavenumber of the fastest-growing mode, $k_{max}$:\n    $$\n    k_{max} = \\sqrt{-\\frac{f''(c_0, T)}{2\\kappa}}\n    $$\n    For $T_1=980\\,\\mathrm{K}$: $k_{max,1} = \\sqrt{-(-20)/(2\\kappa)} = \\sqrt{10/\\kappa}$.\n    For $T_2=900\\,\\mathrm{K}$: $k_{max,2} = \\sqrt{-(-100)/(2\\kappa)} = \\sqrt{50/\\kappa}$.\n    Since $50  10$, $k_{max,2}  k_{max,1}$. The characteristic wavelength is $\\lambda_{max} = 2\\pi/k_{max}$. Since $k_{max,2}  k_{max,1}$, it follows that $\\lambda_{max,2}  \\lambda_{max,1}$. The fastest-growing wavelength decreases for the deeper quench, leading to a finer morphology.\n\n3.  **Growth Rate**: The maximum amplification factor $R_{max}$ is found by evaluating $R(k)$ at $k_{max}$:\n    $$\n    R_{max} = R(k_{max}) = -M(k_{max}^2)(f''(c_0, T) + \\kappa k_{max}^2) = -M\\left(-\\frac{f''(c_0, T)}{2\\kappa}\\right)\\left(f''(c_0, T) + \\kappa \\left(-\\frac{f''(c_0, T)}{2\\kappa}\\right)\\right)\n    $$\n    $$\n    R_{max} = M\\frac{f''(c_0, T)}{2\\kappa}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}f''(c_0, T)\\right) = \\frac{M}{4\\kappa} (f''(c_0, T))^2\n    $$\n    For $T_1=980\\,\\mathrm{K}$: $R_{max,1} = \\frac{M}{4\\kappa} (-20)^2 = \\frac{400M}{4\\kappa}$.\n    For $T_2=900\\,\\mathrm{K}$: $R_{max,2} = \\frac{M}{4\\kappa} (-100)^2 = \\frac{10000M}{4\\kappa}$.\n    Clearly, $R_{max,2} \\gg R_{max,1}$. The composition fluctuations amplify much more rapidly for the deeper quench.\n\nSummary for the deeper quench ($T_2$ vs $T_1$):\n- $f''(c_0,T)$ is more negative.\n- The unstable wavenumber band $(0, k_c)$ is wider, extending to larger $k$.\n- The fastest-growing wavenumber $k_{max}$ is larger.\n- The fastest-growing wavelength $\\lambda_{max}$ is smaller, implying a finer morphology.\n- The maximum growth rate $R_{max}$ is significantly larger, meaning the structure amplifies more rapidly.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\n\n**A. For the deeper quench at $T_2$, the second derivative $f''(c_0,T)$ is more negative, the unstable band extends to larger wave numbers (shorter wavelengths), the fastest-growing wavelength decreases, and the early-stage morphology is finer and amplifies more rapidly than at $T_1$.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with all points derived from the linear stability analysis.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. For the deeper quench at $T_2$, the instability range shifts to smaller wave numbers (longer wavelengths), the fastest-growing wavelength increases, and the early-stage morphology is coarser than at $T_1$.**\nThis statement makes claims opposite to our derivation. The unstable band extends to larger, not smaller, wavenumbers. The fastest-growing wavelength decreases, not increases, leading to a finer, not coarser, morphology.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Quench depth changes only the growth rate amplitude but does not change the unstable band or characteristic wavelength; $T_1$ and $T_2$ produce identical initial length scales.**\nThis is fundamentally incorrect. The temperature $T$ directly controls $f''(c_0,T)$, which in turn determines both the unstable band via $k_c$ and the characteristic wavelength via $\\lambda_{max}$. The length scales are strongly temperature-dependent.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The shallow quench at $T_1$ remains outside the spinodal and suppresses all instabilities, whereas only the deep quench at $T_2$ yields any unstable wavelengths.**\nThis is factually incorrect. The spinodal temperature is $T_s = 1000\\,\\mathrm{K}$. The shallow quench is at $T_1 = 980\\,\\mathrm{K}$. Since $T_1  T_s$, the system is inside the spinodal region and is unstable.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

            "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all necessary data and conditions are provided for a unique solution. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\nThe solution requires the derivation of a semi-implicit Fourier spectral method for the Cahn-Hilliard equation and its implementation to solve for specific test cases. The derivation and implementation steps are outlined below.\n\n### Step 1: Derivation of the Semi-Implicit Numerical Scheme\n\n**1.1. Chemical Potential and Governing Equation**\n\nThe Cahn-Hilliard dynamics are governed by the equation $\\partial_t c = M \\nabla^2 \\mu$, where $M$ is a constant mobility and $\\mu$ is the chemical potential. The chemical potential is the variational derivative of the Ginzburg-Landau free-energy functional $F[c]$:\n$$\nF[c] = \\int \\left( f(c) + \\frac{\\kappa}{2} |\\nabla c|^2 \\right) \\, d\\mathbf{x}\n$$\nThe free-energy density is given by $f(c) = \\frac{\\lambda}{4} (c^2 - 1)^2$. The variational derivative $\\mu = \\delta F / \\delta c$ is found using the Euler-Lagrange equation:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial c} - \\nabla \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial(\\nabla c)}\\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{2} |\\nabla c|^2\\right)\n$$\nThe derivative of the bulk free-energy density is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial c} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial c} \\left( \\frac{\\lambda}{4} (c^4 - 2c^2 + 1) \\right) = \\frac{\\lambda}{4} (4c^3 - 4c) = \\lambda(c^3 - c)\n$$\nThe derivative with respect to the gradient is:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial(\\nabla c)}\\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{2} |\\nabla c|^2\\right) = \\nabla \\cdot (\\kappa \\nabla c) = \\kappa \\nabla^2 c\n$$\nCombining these, the chemical potential is:\n$$\n\\mu(c) = \\lambda(c^3 - c) - \\kappa \\nabla^2 c\n$$\nSubstituting this into the Cahn-Hilliard equation gives the full governing partial differential equation:\n$$\n\\partial_t c = M \\nabla^2 \\left( \\lambda c^3 - \\lambda c - \\kappa \\nabla^2 c \\right)\n$$\n\n**1.2. Formulation in Fourier Space**\n\nOn a one-dimensional periodic domain of length $L$, we can represent the concentration field $c(x,t)$ and its derivatives using a Fourier series. Let $\\hat{c}(k,t) = \\mathcal{F}\\{c(x,t)\\}$ denote the Fourier transform of $c(x,t)$, where $k = 2\\pi m / L$ for integer $m$ is the wavenumber. The spatial derivative operator in Fourier space becomes multiplication by $(ik)$, where $i$ is the imaginary unit. Thus, $\\mathcal{F}\\{\\nabla c\\} = ik\\hat{c}$ and $\\mathcal{F}\\{\\nabla^2 c\\} = (ik)^2\\hat{c} = -k^2\\hat{c}$. Applying the Fourier transform to the governing equation yields:\n$$\n\\partial_t \\hat{c}(k,t) = M(-k^2) \\mathcal{F}\\{\\lambda c^3 - \\lambda c - \\kappa \\nabla^2 c\\}\n$$\n$$\n\\partial_t \\hat{c} = -M k^2 \\left( \\lambda \\widehat{c^3} - \\lambda \\hat{c} - \\kappa(-k^2)\\hat{c} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\partial_t \\hat{c} = -M k^2 \\left( \\lambda \\widehat{c^3} - (\\lambda - \\kappa k^2)\\hat{c} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\partial_t \\hat{c} = -M \\lambda k^2 \\widehat{c^3} + M k^2 (\\lambda - \\kappa k^2)\\hat{c}\n$$\nThis is an ordinary differential equation in time for each Fourier mode $\\hat{c}(k,t)$. The term $-M\\kappa \\nabla^4 c$, which becomes $-M\\kappa k^4 \\hat{c}$ in Fourier space, is highly stiff for large wavenumbers $k$, necessitating an implicit or semi-implicit time integration scheme for numerical stability with large time steps $\\Delta t$.\n\n**1.3. Stabilized Semi-Implicit Scheme Design**\n\nTo construct a stable semi-implicit scheme, we split the right-hand side of the evolution equation into terms that will be treated explicitly and terms that will be treated implicitly. The stiff linear terms are treated implicitly, while the nonlinear term is treated explicitly. To improve stability, we add and subtract a linear stabilization term $S c$, where $S$ is a positive constant.\n\nThe governing equation is rewritten by adding and subtracting $M \\nabla^2 (S c)$:\n$$\n\\partial_t c = M \\nabla^2 (\\lambda c^3 - \\lambda c - \\kappa \\nabla^2 c + Sc - Sc)\n$$\nWe group the terms as follows for a semi-implicit (IMEX) time discretization from $t^n$ to $t^{n+1}=t^n+\\Delta t$:\n$$\n\\frac{c^{n+1} - c^n}{\\Delta t} = \\underbrace{M \\nabla^2 (\\lambda (c^n)^3 - (\\lambda+S)c^n)}_{\\text{Explicit part}} + \\underbrace{M \\nabla^2 (S c^{n+1} - \\kappa \\nabla^2 c^{n+1})}_{\\text{Implicit part}}\n$$\nTransforming this discretized equation into Fourier space:\n$$\n\\frac{\\hat{c}^{n+1} - \\hat{c}^n}{\\Delta t} = M(-k^2)[\\lambda \\widehat{(c^n)^3} - (\\lambda+S)\\hat{c}^n] + M(-k^2)[S\\hat{c}^{n+1} - \\kappa(-k^2)\\hat{c}^{n+1}]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\hat{c}^{n+1} - \\hat{c}^n}{\\Delta t} = -M k^2(\\lambda \\widehat{(c^n)^3} - (\\lambda+S)\\hat{c}^n) - M k^2(S\\hat{c}^{n+1} + \\kappa k^2\\hat{c}^{n+1})\n$$\nNow, we rearrange to solve for $\\hat{c}^{n+1}$:\n$$\n\\hat{c}^{n+1} - \\hat{c}^n = -\\Delta t M k^2(\\lambda \\widehat{(c^n)^3} - (\\lambda+S)\\hat{c}^n) - \\Delta t M k^2(S + \\kappa k^2)\\hat{c}^{n+1}\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{c}^{n+1} (1 + \\Delta t M k^2(S + \\kappa k^2)) = \\hat{c}^n - \\Delta t M k^2 \\lambda \\widehat{(c^n)^3} + \\Delta t M k^2 (\\lambda+S)\\hat{c}^n\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{c}^{n+1} (1 + \\Delta t M k^2(S + \\kappa k^2)) = \\hat{c}^n (1 + \\Delta t M k^2(\\lambda+S)) - \\Delta t M k^2 \\lambda \\widehat{(c^n)^3}\n$$\n\n**1.4. Final Update Formula and Properties**\n\nThis gives the final update formula for the Fourier coefficient of each mode $k$:\n$$\n\\hat{c}^{n+1}(k) = \\frac{\\hat{c}^n(k)(1 + \\Delta t \\, M \\, k^2(\\lambda+S)) - \\Delta t \\, M \\, k^2 \\, \\lambda \\, \\mathcal{F}((c^n)^3)(k)}{1 + \\Delta t \\, M \\, k^2 \\, (S + \\kappa k^2)}\n$$\n- **Stabilization constant $S$**: The stability of this scheme is related to the convexity of the energy functional. The curvature of the bulk energy density is $f''(c) = \\lambda(3c^2-1)$. The term $-f(c)$ can be made convex by adding a quadratic term $\\frac{S}{2}c^2$ with $S \\ge \\max(-f''(c))$. The minimum of $f''(c)$ is $-\\lambda$ (at $c=0$), so a choice of $S \\ge \\lambda$ is appropriate. The problem specifies $S=\\lambda$, which fulfills this stability requirement.\n\n- **Positive Denominator**: The denominator of the update formula is $D(k) = 1 + \\Delta t \\, M \\, k^2 \\, (S + \\kappa k^2)$. Given that $\\Delta t  0$, $M  0$, $\\kappa  0$, and we choose $S = \\lambda  0$, all terms in the product are non-negative. Thus, $D(k) \\ge 1$ for all wavenumbers $k$, ensuring the denominator is strictly positive and the scheme is well-defined for any $\\Delta t  0$.\n\n- **Mass Conservation (Zero Mode)**: For the zero mode ($k=0$), the update formula simplifies significantly. The numerator becomes $\\hat{c}^n(0)(1+0) - 0 = \\hat{c}^n(0)$. The denominator becomes $1+0=1$. Therefore, $\\hat{c}^{n+1}(0) = \\hat{c}^n(0)$. Since the spatial mean $\\overline{c}$ is proportional to $\\hat{c}(0)$, this directly implies $\\overline{c}^{\\, n+1} = \\overline{c}^{\\, n}$, so the total mass (or mean concentration) is conserved by the scheme.\n\n### Step 2: Implementation of the Solver\n\nThe implementation will use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on a discrete grid.\n\n- **Discretization**: The domain $[0,L)$ is discretized with $N$ points $x_j = j(L/N)$ for $j=0, \\dots, N-1$.\n- **Wavenumbers**: The discrete wavenumbers corresponding to the FFT are computed using `numpy.fft.fftfreq(N, d=L/N)` and multiplied by $2\\pi$ to convert from frequency to angular wavenumber.\n- **Algorithm**:\n  1. Initialize the concentration field $c^n(x_j)$ on the grid.\n  2. Compute the cubic term $(c^n)^3$.\n  3. Compute the FFTs $\\hat{c}^n = \\mathcal{F}\\{c^n\\}$ and $\\widehat{(c^n)^3} = \\mathcal{F}\\{(c^n)^3\\}$.\n  4. For each discrete wavenumber $k$, calculate the numerator and denominator of the derived update formula.\n  5. Compute the updated Fourier coefficients $\\hat{c}^{n+1}$.\n  6. Compute the new concentration field $c^{n+1}$ by applying the inverse FFT to $\\hat{c}^{n+1}$ and taking the real part.\n- **Quantities to Compute**:\n  - $q_1$: Check if all values of the denominator array are greater than $0$.\n  - $q_2$: Check if the absolute difference between the mean of $c^{n+1}$ and $c^n$ is below a small tolerance ($10^{-12}$).\n  - $q_3$: Calculate the linear amplification factor $g(k)$ for all non-zero $k$, and find the maximum of its absolute value.\n  - $q_4$: Compute the change in total free energy, $\\Delta F = F[c^{n+1}] - F[c^{n}]$. The free energy $F[c]$ is calculated as a discrete sum over the grid:\n    $F[c] \\approx \\frac{L}{N} \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \\left( \\frac{\\lambda}{4}(c_j^2 - 1)^2 + \\frac{\\kappa}{2} (\\nabla c)_j^2 \\right)$.\n    The gradient term $(\\nabla c)_j$ is computed spectrally by taking the inverse FFT of $(ik\\hat{c}_k)$.",
