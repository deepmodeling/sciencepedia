            "introduction": "An order-disorder transition is driven by the fundamental competition between internal energy and configurational entropy. At high temperatures, entropy favors a random arrangement of atoms, but as the temperature is lowered, the energetic benefit of forming specific chemical bonds can stabilize an ordered structure. This exercise () provides a foundational look at this process by asking you to derive the critical ordering temperature, $T_c$, from first principles within the Bragg-Williams mean-field approximation. By analyzing the curvature of the free energy function, you will directly probe the stability of the disordered state and see how the interplay between an energetic driving force and configurational entropy determines the onset of the B2 ordered phase.",

The derivation will be based on the provided Bragg-Williams mean-field model.\n\nThe free energy per lattice site is given by the fundamental relation:\n$$\nF(\\eta) = E(\\eta) - T S(\\eta)\n$$\nwhere $E(\\eta)$ is the internal energy per site, $S(\\eta)$ is the entropy per site, and $T$ is the temperature. We will analyze the energy and entropy contributions separately.\n\nFirst, we consider the internal energy per site, $E(\\eta)$. The problem provides its expansion to second order in $\\eta$:\n$$\nE(\\eta) = E_0 - \\frac{z}{2}\\,\\lambda\\,\\eta^2 + \\mathcal{O}(\\eta^4)\n$$\nwhere $E_0$ is the energy of the disordered state, $z$ is the nearest-neighbor coordination number, and $\\lambda$ is an effective interaction parameter driving the ordering.

The system consists of two equally-sized sublattices, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. The total entropy is the sum of the entropies of each sublattice. Assuming ideal mixing on each sublattice, the entropy per site is given by:\n$$\nS(\\eta) = -\\frac{k_B}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\left[ p_i^{\\alpha} \\ln(p_i^{\\alpha}) + p_i^{\\beta} \\ln(p_i^{\\beta}) \\right]\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $p_i^{\\alpha}$ and $p_i^{\\beta}$ are the occupation probabilities of species $i$ on the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ sublattices, respectively. These are given as:\n$$\np_i^{\\alpha} = c_i + s_i \\,\\eta\n$$\n$$\np_i^{\\beta} = c_i - s_i \\,\\eta\n$$\nSubstituting these into the entropy expression:\n$$\nS(\\eta) = -\\frac{k_B}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\left[ (c_i + s_i \\eta) \\ln(c_i + s_i \\eta) + (c_i - s_i \\eta) \\ln(c_i - s_i \\eta) \\right]\n$$\nTo find the entropy's contribution to the curvature of the free energy, we calculate the second derivative of $S(\\eta)$ with respect to $\\eta$.

In this mean-field (Landau-type) framework, this occurs when the curvature of the free energy at $\\eta=0$ changes sign from positive (stable minimum) to negative (unstable maximum). The transition point is where the curvature is exactly zero.\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial \\eta^2}\\right|_{\\eta=0, T=T_c} = 0\n$$\nSetting our expression for the curvature to zero at $T=T_c$:\n$$\n-z\\,\\lambda + T_c\\,k_B \\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\frac{s_i^2}{c_i} = 0\n$$\nSolving this equation for $T_c$:\n$$\nT_c\\,k_B \\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\frac{s_i^2}{c_i} = z\\,\\lambda\n$$\n$$\nT_c = \\frac{z\\,\\lambda}{k_B \\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\frac{s_i^2}{c_i}}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the coordination number for the BCC lattice is $z=8$.

The condition $\\lambda  0$ ensures $T_c  0$, as physically required for an ordering transition. The denominator term $\\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\frac{s_i^2}{c_i}$ is strictly positive because all $c_i  0$ and at least one $s_i$ must be non-zero for ordering to be possible, making $T_c$ well-defined and positive.",

Assume the APB profile takes the stationary solution\n$$\n\\eta(x)=\\tanh\\!\\left(\\frac{x}{\\delta}\\right),\n$$\nwith the interfacial thickness\n$$\n\\delta=\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\,K(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})}{\\Delta f}}.\n$$\nModel the gradient anisotropy with the lowest-order cubic invariant in the direction cosines,\n$$\nK(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})=K_0\\left[1+\\alpha\\left(n_x^{4}+n_y^{4}+n_z^{4}-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\right],\n$$\nwhere $K_00$ and $|\\alpha|1$ so that $K(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})0$ for all orientations, and the direction cosines satisfy $n_x^{2}+n_y^{2}+n_z^{2}=1$.\n\nStarting from this continuum description and without invoking any result not derivable from the stated free-energy density and profile, derive the antiphase boundary energy per unit area $\\gamma(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})$ by integrating the excess free-energy density across the interface. Express your final answer as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of $\\Delta f$, $K_0$, $\\alpha$, and $(n_x,n_y,n_z)$. You do not need to evaluate any numerical values. If this quantity were to be reported numerically, it should be given in Joules per square meter. Provide your final expression for $\\gamma(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})$ only. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The antiphase boundary (APB) energy per unit area, denoted by $\\gamma(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})$, is defined as the integral of the excess free-energy density across the interface. The free energy of the bulk equilibrium phases, where the order parameter $\\eta = \\pm 1$, is $f_{bulk} = \\frac{\\Delta f}{2}(1 - (\\pm 1)^2)^2 = 0$. Therefore, the given free-energy density functional $f$ represents the excess free-energy density relative to the bulk. The APB energy is thus given by the integral:\n$$\n\\gamma(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(\\eta(x)) \\,dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left[ K(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})\\left(\\frac{d\\eta}{dx}\\right)^{2} + \\frac{\\Delta f}{2}\\left(1-\\eta^{2}\\right)^{2} \\right] dx\n$$\nThe problem states that the profile $\\eta(x)$ is a stationary solution, which means it minimizes the free energy functional $F[\\eta] = \\int f(\\eta, \\frac{d\\eta}{dx}) dx$. Such a profile must satisfy the Euler-Lagrange equation, $\\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta \\eta} = 0$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\eta} - \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial(d\\eta/dx)}\\right) = 0\n$$\nFrom the given expression for $f$, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\eta} = \\frac{\\Delta f}{2} \\cdot 2(1-\\eta^2) \\cdot (-2\\eta) = -2\\Delta f \\eta (1-\\eta^2)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial(d\\eta/dx)} = 2K(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})\\frac{d\\eta}{dx}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the Euler-Lagrange equation gives the governing differential equation for the stationary profile:\n$$\n-2\\Delta f \\eta (1-\\eta^2) - 2K(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})\\frac{d^2\\eta}{dx^2} = 0\n$$\n$$\nK(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})\\frac{d^2\\eta}{dx^2} + \\Delta f \\eta (1-\\eta^2) = 0\n$$\nAs required by the problem statement not to invoke external results, we derive a first integral of this equation by multiplying by $\\frac{d\\eta}{dx}$:\n$$\nK(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})\\frac{d^2\\eta}{dx^2}\\frac{d\\eta}{dx} + \\Delta f \\eta (1-\\eta^2)\\frac{d\\eta}{dx} = 0\n$$\nRecognizing that $\\frac{d^2\\eta}{dx^2}\\frac{d\\eta}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{d\\eta}{dx}\\right)^2$ and $\\eta(1-\\eta^2)\\frac{d\\eta}{dx} = -\\frac{1}{4}\\frac{d}{dx}(1-\\eta^2)^2$, we can rewrite the equation as:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left[ \\frac{1}{2}K(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})\\left(\\frac{d\\eta}{dx}\\right)^{2} - \\frac{\\Delta f}{4}(1-\\eta^2)^2 \\right] = 0\n$$\nThis implies that the quantity in the brackets is a constant along the profile. We evaluate this constant using the boundary conditions at $x \\to \\pm\\infty$, where the system is in the bulk state. For the APB, $\\eta \\to \\pm 1$ and its derivative $\\frac{d\\eta}{dx} \\to 0$. In this limit, both terms inside the bracket are zero. Therefore, the constant is zero. This gives us the following key relation, valid for any point $x$ within the stationary interface profile:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}K(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})\\left(\\frac{d\\eta}{dx}\\right)^{2} - \\frac{\\Delta f}{4}(1-\\eta^2)^2 = 0 \\implies K(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})\\left(\\frac{d\\eta}{dx}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{\\Delta f}{2}(1-\\eta^2)^2\n$$\nThis result demonstrates the equipartition of energy for the stationary solution: the gradient energy density is equal to the potential energy density at every point across the interface.\n\nUsing this equipartition relation, the integrand for the APB energy can be simplified. We substitute the potential energy term with the gradient energy term:\n$$\n\\gamma(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left[ K(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})\\left(\\frac{d\\eta}{dx}\\right)^{2} + K(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})\\left(\\frac{d\\eta}{dx}\\right)^{2} \\right] dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} 2K(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})\\left(\\frac{d\\eta}{dx}\\right)^{2} dx\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given profile $\\eta(x) = \\tanh\\left(\\frac{x}{\\delta}\\right)$. The derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\eta}{dx} = \\frac{1}{\\delta} \\text{sech}^2\\left(\\frac{x}{\\delta}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\gamma(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})$:\n$$\n\\gamma(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} 2K(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}) \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\delta} \\text{sech}^2\\left(\\frac{x}{\\delta}\\right) \\right]^2 dx = \\frac{2K(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})}{\\delta^2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\text{sech}^4\\left(\\frac{x}{\\delta}\\right) dx\n$$\nThe problem provides the expression for the interfacial thickness $\\delta = \\sqrt{\\frac{2K(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})}{\\Delta f}}$, from which we get $\\delta^2 = \\frac{2K(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})}{\\Delta f}$. Substituting this into the pre-factor of the integral simplifies it to:\n$$\n\\frac{2K(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})}{\\delta^2} = \\frac{2K(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})}{2K(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})/\\Delta f} = \\Delta f\n$$\nThe expression for the APB energy becomes:\n$$\n\\gamma(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}) = \\Delta f \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\text{sech}^4\\left(\\frac{x}{\\delta}\\right) dx\n$$\nTo evaluate the integral, we perform a change of variables with $u = \\frac{x}{\\delta}$, so $dx = \\delta \\,du$. The limits of integration remain $(-\\infty, \\infty)$.\n$$\n\\gamma(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}) = \\Delta f \\cdot \\delta \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\text{sech}^4(u) \\,du\n$$\nThe definite integral of $\\text{sech}^4(u)$ can be calculated as follows:\n$$\n\\int \\text{sech}^4(u) \\,du = \\int \\text{sech}^2(u) \\text{sech}^2(u) \\,du = \\int (1-\\tanh^2(u)) \\text{sech}^2(u) \\,du\n$$\nLet $v = \\tanh(u)$, then $dv = \\text{sech}^2(u) \\,du$. The indefinite integral becomes:\n$$\n\\int (1-v^2) \\,dv = v - \\frac{1}{3}v^3 = \\tanh(u) - \\frac{1}{3}\\tanh^3(u)\n$$\nEvaluating the definite integral from $-\\infty$ to $\\infty$:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\text{sech}^4(u) \\,du = \\left[ \\tanh(u) - \\frac{1}{3}\\tanh^3(u) \\right]_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\n$$\nAs $u \\to \\infty$, $\\tanh(u) \\to 1$, and the expression evaluates to $1 - \\frac{1}{3}(1)^3 = \\frac{2}{3}$.\nAs $u \\to -\\infty$, $\\tanh(u) \\to -1$, and the expression evaluates to $-1 - \\frac{1}{3}(-1)^3 = -1 + \\frac{1}{3} = -\\frac{2}{3}$.\nThe value of the definite integral is the difference: $\\frac{2}{3} - \\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = \\frac{4}{3}$.\nNow we substitute this result back into the expression for $\\gamma(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})$:\n$$\n\\gamma(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}) = \\Delta f \\cdot \\delta \\cdot \\frac{4}{3}\n$$\nNext, we substitute the expression for $\\delta$:\n$$\n\\gamma(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}) = \\frac{4}{3} \\Delta f \\sqrt{\\frac{2K(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})}{\\Delta f}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\sqrt{(\\Delta f)^2 \\frac{2K(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})}{\\Delta f}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\sqrt{2 \\Delta f K(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute the given anisotropic form of the gradient coefficient $K(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})$:\n$$\nK(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}) = K_0\\left[1+\\alpha\\left(n_x^{4}+n_y^{4}+n_z^{4}-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\right]\n$$\nThis yields the final closed-form expression for the antiphase boundary energy per unit area:\n$$\n\\gamma(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}) = \\frac{4}{3} \\sqrt{2 \\Delta f K_0\\left[1+\\alpha\\left(n_x^{4}+n_y^{4}+n_z^{4}-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\right]}\n$$\nThis expression gives the APB energy as a function of the material parameters $\\Delta f$, $K_0$, and $\\alpha$, and its orientation dependence through the direction cosines $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ of the boundary normal.",
