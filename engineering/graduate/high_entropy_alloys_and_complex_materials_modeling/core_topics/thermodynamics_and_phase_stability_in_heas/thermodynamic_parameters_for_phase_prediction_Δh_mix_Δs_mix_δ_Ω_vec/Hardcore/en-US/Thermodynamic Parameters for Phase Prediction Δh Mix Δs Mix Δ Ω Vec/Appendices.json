            "problem": "A crystalline High-Entropy Alloy (HEA) candidate is formed by $5$ metallic elements in equiatomic proportions, occupying substitutional lattice sites in a random manner above any ordering transition. In thermodynamic phase-prediction frameworks that weigh configurational entropy against enthalpic driving forces (for example, the parameter $\\Omega$ alongside enthalpy of mixing $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}}$, atomic size mismatch $\\delta$, and Valence Electron Concentration (VEC)), the configurational entropy of mixing $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}$ is a central quantity. Assuming an ideal substitutional solid solution with random site occupancy, negligible short-range order, and no interaction-induced bias among species, derive the molar configurational entropy of mixing $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}$ starting explicitly from Boltzmann’s entropy postulate $S = k_{B} \\ln W$, where $W$ is the number of distinct atomic arrangements on $N_{A}$ lattice sites (one mole, with $N_{A}$ denoting Avogadro’s number), and the large-$N_{A}$ limit.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the molar configurational entropy of mixing, $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}$, for an ideal multicomponent substitutional alloy, and its subsequent numerical evaluation for a specific high-entropy alloy. The derivation begins with the fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics, Boltzmann's entropy formula.\n\nAccording to Boltzmann's postulate, the entropy $S$ of a system is related to the number of accessible microstates $W$ by the equation:\n$$S = k_{B} \\ln W$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nFor a crystalline solid solution with $n$ components distributed over a total of $N$ lattice sites, we define $N_i$ as the number of atoms of component $i$, such that the total number of atoms is $N = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} N_i$. The mole fraction of component $i$ is $x_i = N_i/N$. Under the assumption of a random distribution with no short-range order, the number of distinct ways to arrange these atoms on the lattice, $W$, is given by the multinomial coefficient:\n$$W = \\frac{N!}{N_1! N_2! \\cdots N_n!} = \\frac{N!}{\\prod_{i=1}^{n} N_i!}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $W$ into Boltzmann's entropy formula gives the configurational entropy, $S_{\\mathrm{conf}}$:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{conf}} = k_{B} \\ln \\left( \\frac{N!}{\\prod_{i=1}^{n} N_i!} \\right) = k_{B} \\left( \\ln(N!) - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln(N_i!) \\right)$$\nTo proceed, we use Stirling's approximation for the natural logarithm of a factorial, which is highly accurate for large numbers of particles, such as Avogadro's number ($N_A$) as specified in the problem. The approximation is:\n$$\\ln(M!) \\approx M \\ln M - M$$\nApplying this to $\\ln(N!)$ and each $\\ln(N_i!)$ term:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{conf}} \\approx k_{B} \\left[ (N \\ln N - N) - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (N_i \\ln N_i - N_i) \\right]$$\nDistributing the summation:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{conf}} \\approx k_{B} \\left[ N \\ln N - N - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} N_i \\ln N_i + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} N_i \\right]$$\nSince the sum of the atoms of all components is the total number of atoms, $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} N_i = N$, the terms $-N$ and $+\\sum_{i=1}^{n} N_i$ cancel each other out:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{conf}} \\approx k_{B} \\left[ N \\ln N - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} N_i \\ln N_i \\right]$$\nNow, we express the number of atoms of each component, $N_i$, in terms of its mole fraction, $x_i$, and the total number of atoms, $N$: $N_i = x_i N$. Substituting this into the entropy expression:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{conf}} \\approx k_{B} \\left[ N \\ln N - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i N) \\ln(x_i N) \\right]$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(ab) = \\ln(a) + \\ln(b)$:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{conf}} \\approx k_{B} \\left[ N \\ln N - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i N (\\ln x_i + \\ln N) \\right]$$\n$$S_{\\mathrm{conf}} \\approx k_{B} \\left[ N \\ln N - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i N \\ln x_i - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i N \\ln N \\right]$$\nWe can factor out $N$ and $N \\ln N$ from the summations:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{conf}} \\approx k_{B} \\left[ N \\ln N - N \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \\ln x_i - N \\ln N \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \\right]$$\nBy definition, the sum of all mole fractions is unity: $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = 1$. Substituting this into the last term:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{conf}} \\approx k_{B} \\left[ N \\ln N - N \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \\ln x_i - N \\ln N (1) \\right]$$\nThe terms $N \\ln N$ and $-N \\ln N$ cancel, leaving:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{conf}} \\approx -k_{B} N \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \\ln x_i$$\nThe configurational entropy of mixing, $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}$, is the change in entropy upon mixing the pure components to form the solution. The configurational entropy of the unmixed, perfectly ordered pure components is zero (as for each pure component $i$, $W = N_i!/N_i! = 1$, so $S_i = k_B \\ln 1 = 0$). Therefore, $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}} = S_{\\mathrm{conf}} - S_{\\mathrm{unmixed}} = S_{\\mathrm{conf}} - 0 = S_{\\mathrm{conf}}$.\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}} = -k_{B} N \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \\ln x_i$$\nThe problem requests the molar entropy of mixing. This corresponds to the case where the total number of atoms is Avogadro's number, $N = N_A$. The molar entropy, which we continue to denote as $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}$, is thus:\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}} = -k_{B} N_A \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \\ln x_i$$\nRecognizing that the product of the Boltzmann constant and Avogadro's number is the Universal Gas Constant, $R = k_B N_A$, we arrive at the final expression for the molar configurational entropy of mixing:\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}} = -R \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \\ln x_i$$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression for the specific case of a $5$-component equiatomic alloy.\nThe number of components is $n=5$.\nThe term \"equiatomic proportions\" means that the mole fraction is the same for all components:\n$$x_i = \\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{1}{5} \\quad \\text{for } i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$$\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}} = -R \\sum_{i=1}^{5} \\frac{1}{5} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)$$\nSince the term inside the summation is constant for all $i$:\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}} = -R \\cdot 5 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{5} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}} = -R \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(1/a) = -\\ln(a)$:\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}} = -R (-\\ln 5) = R \\ln 5$$\nNow we substitute the given numerical value for the Universal Gas Constant, $R = 8.314462618\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$:\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}} = (8.314462618\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times \\ln(5)$$\nThe natural logarithm of $5$ is approximately $\\ln(5) \\approx 1.6094379124$.\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}} \\approx 8.314462618 \\times 1.6094379124\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$$\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}} \\approx 13.3831502\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1$, $3$, $3$, and $8$. The fifth significant digit is $3$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}} \\approx 13.38\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$$\nThis is the final numerical value for the molar configurational entropy of mixing for the specified alloy.",
