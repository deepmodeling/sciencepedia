            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the molar configurational entropy for a B2-ordered binary alloy and the determination of its extrema under equiatomic composition, based on the Compound Energy Formalism (CEF).\n\nFirst, we derive the general expression for the molar configurational entropy.

The number of $A$ atoms is $N_A^{(1)} = N y_A^{(1)}$ and the number of $B$ atoms is $N_B^{(1)} = N y_B^{(1)}$.

The number of moles of formula units is $n = N/N_{A}$, where $N_A$ is the Avogadro constant.\n$$\nS_m = \\frac{S}{n} = \\frac{S N_A}{N} \\approx -N_A k_B \\left[ (y_A^{(1)} \\ln y_A^{(1)} + y_B^{(1)} \\ln y_B^{(1)}) + (y_A^{(2)} \\ln y_A^{(2)} + y_B^{(2)} \\ln y_B^{(2)}) \\right]\n$$\nUsing the definition of the molar gas constant, $R = N_A k_B$, we obtain the molar entropy:\n$$\nS_m = -R \\left[ (y_A^{(1)} \\ln y_A^{(1)} + y_B^{(1)} \\ln y_B^{(1)}) + (y_A^{(2)} \\ln y_A^{(2)} + y_B^{(2)} \\ln y_B^{(2)}) \\right]\n$$\nThe problem asks for the dimensionless entropy $S/R$, which we identify with $S_m/R$:\n$$\n\\frac{S_m}{R} = -(y_A^{(1)} \\ln y_A^{(1)} + y_B^{(1)} \\ln y_B^{(1)} + y_A^{(2)} \\ln y_A^{(2)} + y_B^{(2)} \\ln y_B^{(2)})\n$$\nThis is the first part of the required answer.\n\nNext, we find the extrema of this entropy for an equiatomic composition, $x_A=x_B=\\frac{1}{2}$. The overall mole fraction of component $A$ is related to the site fractions by $x_A = \\frac{a^{(1)}y_A^{(1)} + a^{(2)}y_A^{(2)}}{a^{(1)}+a^{(2)}}$. With $a^{(1)}=a^{(2)}=1$, we have $x_A = \\frac{y_A^{(1)}+y_A^{(2)}}{2}$. For $x_A=\\frac{1}{2}$, this implies the constraint $y_A^{(1)}+y_A^{(2)}=1$.\nCombined with the sublattice constraints $y_A^{(1)}+y_B^{(1)}=1$ and $y_A^{(2)}+y_B^{(2)}=1$, we can express all site fractions in terms of a single variable, let $y = y_A^{(1)}$.\n$y_B^{(1)} = 1 - y_A^{(1)} = 1-y$\n$y_A^{(2)} = 1 - y_A^{(1)} = 1-y$\n$y_B^{(2)} = 1 - y_A^{(2)} = 1 - (1-y) = y$\nThe site fractions are $(y_A^{(1)}, y_B^{(1)}) = (y, 1-y)$ and $(y_A^{(2)}, y_B^{(2)}) = (1-y, y)$. The variable $y$ ranges from $0$ to $1$.\nSubstituting these into the entropy expression:\n$$\n\\frac{S_m(y)}{R} = -[y \\ln y + (1-y)\\ln(1-y) + (1-y)\\ln(1-y) + y\\ln y]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{S_m(y)}{R} = -2[y \\ln y + (1-y)\\ln(1-y)]\n$$\nTo find the extrema, we differentiate with respect to $y$ and set the result to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dy}\\left(\\frac{S_m}{R}\\right) = -2 \\frac{d}{dy}[y \\ln y + (1-y)\\ln(1-y)] = -2[(\\ln y + 1) + (-\\ln(1-y)-1)] = -2\\ln\\left(\\frac{y}{1-y}\\right)\n$$\nSetting the derivative to zero: $-2\\ln\\left(\\frac{y}{1-y}\\right) = 0 \\implies \\frac{y}{1-y}=1 \\implies y=\\frac{1}{2}$.\nTo classify this extremum, we examine the second derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2}{dy^2}\\left(\\frac{S_m}{R}\\right) = \\frac{d}{dy}\\left[-2\\ln\\left(\\frac{y}{1-y}\\right)\\right] = -2\\left(\\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{1-y}\\right) = \\frac{-2}{y(1-y)}\n$$\nFor $y \\in (0,1)$, the second derivative is always negative, indicating that the function is concave. Thus, $y=\\frac{1}{2}$ corresponds to a global maximum.\nThe maximum value of the molar configurational entropy is:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{S_m}{R}\\right)_{\\text{max}} = -2\\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\left(1-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\ln\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right] = -2\\left[\\frac{1}{2}(-\\ln 2) + \\frac{1}{2}(-\\ln 2)\\right] = -2(-\\ln 2) = 2\\ln 2\n$$\nThis maximum occurs for the configuration $y_A^{(1)}=y_A^{(2)}=y_B^{(1)}=y_B^{(2)}=\\frac{1}{2}$, which represents a completely disordered state where both sublattices are randomly occupied.\n\nThe minimum value must occur at the boundaries of the domain $y \\in [0,1]$. We evaluate the function at $y=0$ and $y=1$. Using the fact that $\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} x\\ln x = 0$:\n$$\n\\lim_{y\\to 0^+} \\frac{S_m(y)}{R} = -2[\\lim_{y\\to 0^+}(y\\ln y) + (1-0)\\ln(1-0)] = -2[0+0] = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\lim_{y\\to 1^-} \\frac{S_m(y)}{R} = -2[(1)\\ln(1) + \\lim_{y\\to 1^-}((1-y)\\ln(1-y))] = -2[0+0] = 0\n$$\nThe minimum value of the molar configurational entropy is $0$.

In the perfectly ordered state, $y_{A}^{(\\alpha)} = 1$ and $y_{B}^{(\\beta)} = 1$. In the fully disordered state, atoms are randomly distributed, so for an equiatomic alloy, all site fractions are $0.5$, i.e., $y_{A}^{(\\alpha)} = y_{A}^{(\\beta)} = y_{B}^{(\\alpha)} = y_{B}^{(\\beta)} = 0.5$.\n\nWe need to express the four site fractions in terms of a single variable. The given constraints are:\n$1.$ $y_{A}^{(\\alpha)} + y_{B}^{(\\alpha)} = 1$\n$2.$ $y_{A}^{(\\beta)} + y_{B}^{(\\beta)} = 1$\n$3.$ $y_{A}^{(\\alpha)} + y_{A}^{(\\beta)} = 1$ (from equiatomic composition $x_A=0.5$)\n\nFrom ($3$), we have $y_{A}^{(\\beta)} = 1 - y_{A}^{(\\alpha)}$.\nFrom ($1$), we have $y_{B}^{(\\alpha)} = 1 - y_{A}^{(\\alpha)}$.\nThus, $y_{A}^{(\\beta)} = y_{B}^{(\\alpha)}$.\nFrom ($2$), $y_{B}^{(\\beta)} = 1 - y_{A}^{(\\beta)} = 1 - (1 - y_{A}^{(\\alpha)}) = y_{A}^{(\\alpha)}$.\n\nAll site fractions can be expressed in terms of $y_{A}^{(\\alpha)}$.

Express Gibbs Energy in Terms of $\\eta$**\nThe Gibbs energy $G$ is composed of an energy of mixing term, $G_{mix}$, and a configurational free energy term, $G_{conf}$.\n$G = G_{mix} + G_{conf}$\n\nThe mixing energy term is:\n$G_{mix} = \\sum_{i,j} y_{i}^{(\\alpha)} y_{j}^{(\\beta)} G^{0}_{ij} = y_{A}^{(\\alpha)}y_{A}^{(\\beta)}G^{0}_{AA} + y_{A}^{(\\alpha)}y_{B}^{(\\beta)}G^{0}_{AB} + y_{B}^{(\\alpha)}y_{A}^{(\\beta)}G^{0}_{BA} + y_{B}^{(\\alpha)}y_{B}^{(\\beta)}G^{0}_{BB}$\nSubstituting the site fractions and using $G^{0}_{AB} = G^{0}_{BA}$:\n$G_{mix} = \\left(\\frac{1+\\eta}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1-\\eta}{2}\\right) G^{0}_{AA} + \\left(\\frac{1+\\eta}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1+\\eta}{2}\\right) G^{0}_{AB} + \\left(\\frac{1-\\eta}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1-\\eta}{2}\\right) G^{0}_{BA} + \\left(\\frac{1-\\eta}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1+\\eta}{2}\\right) G^{0}_{BB}$\n$G_{mix} = \\frac{1-\\eta^2}{4}(G^{0}_{AA} + G^{0}_{BB}) + \\frac{(1+\\eta)^2 + (1-\\eta)^2}{4} G^{0}_{AB}$\nSince $(1+\\eta)^2 + (1-\\eta)^2 = 2(1+\\eta^2)$,\n$G_{mix} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left[ (1-\\eta^2)(G^{0}_{AA} + G^{0}_{BB}) + 2(1+\\eta^2)G^{0}_{AB} \\right]$\n$G_{mix} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left[ (G^{0}_{AA} + G^{0}_{BB} + 2G^{0}_{AB}) + \\eta^2(2G^{0}_{AB} - G^{0}_{AA} - G^{0}_{BB}) \\right]$\nUsing the definition $\\Delta E = G^{0}_{AB} + G^{0}_{BA} - G^{0}_{AA} - G^{0}_{BB} = 2G^{0}_{AB} - G^{0}_{AA} - G^{0}_{BB}$:\n$G_{mix} = \\frac{1}{4}(G^{0}_{AA} + G^{0}_{BB} + 2G^{0}_{AB}) + \\frac{1}{4}\\Delta E \\eta^2$\n\nThe configurational free energy term is:\n$G_{conf} = R T \\left[ y_{A}^{(\\alpha)} \\ln y_{A}^{(\\alpha)} + y_{B}^{(\\alpha)} \\ln y_{B}^{(\\alpha)} + y_{A}^{(\\beta)} \\ln y_{A}^{(\\beta)} + y_{B}^{(\\beta)} \\ln y_{B}^{(\\beta)} \\right]$\nDue to the symmetries $y_A^{(\\alpha)} = y_B^{(\\beta)}$ and $y_B^{(\\alpha)} = y_A^{(\\beta)}$, this simplifies to:\n$G_{conf} = 2 R T \\left[ y_{A}^{(\\alpha)} \\ln y_{A}^{(\\alpha)} + y_{B}^{(\\alpha)} \\ln y_{B}^{(\\alpha)} \\right]$\n$G_{conf} = 2 R T \\left[ \\left(\\frac{1+\\eta}{2}\\right)\\ln\\left(\\frac{1+\\eta}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1-\\eta}{2}\\right)\\ln\\left(\\frac{1-\\eta}{2}\\right) \\right]$\n$G_{conf} = RT \\left[ (1+\\eta)\\ln(1+\\eta) + (1-\\eta)\\ln(1-\\eta) - 2\\ln(2) \\right]$\n\n**3. Landau-like Expansion of Gibbs Energy**\nWe expand $G(\\eta) = G_{mix}(\\eta) + G_{conf}(\\eta)$ as a Taylor series around the disordered state $\\eta=0$ up to the second order in $\\eta$.\n$G(\\eta) \\approx G(0) + \\eta \\left.\\frac{dG}{d\\eta}\\right|_{\\eta=0} + \\frac{\\eta^2}{2} \\left.\\frac{d^2G}{d\\eta^2}\\right|_{\\eta=0}$\n\nThe $G_{mix}$ term is already a polynomial in $\\eta^2$. Its expansion is trivial.\nThe $G_{conf}$ term must be expanded. Let $f(\\eta) = (1+\\eta)\\ln(1+\\eta) + (1-\\eta)\\ln(1-\\eta) - 2\\ln(2)$.\n$f(0) = 1\\ln(1) + 1\\ln(1) - 2\\ln(2) = -2\\ln(2)$.\n$f'(\\eta) = \\ln(1+\\eta) + 1 - \\ln(1-\\eta) - 1 = \\ln(1+\\eta) - \\ln(1-\\eta)$. So, $f'(0)=0$.\n$f''(\\eta) = \\frac{1}{1+\\eta} + \\frac{1}{1-\\eta} = \\frac{2}{1-\\eta^2}$. So, $f''(0)=2$.\nThe expansion of $f(\\eta)$ is $f(\\eta) \\approx f(0) + \\frac{f''(0)}{2}\\eta^2 = -2\\ln(2) + \\eta^2$.\nSo, $G_{conf}(\\eta) \\approx RT(-2\\ln(2) + \\eta^2)$.\n\nCombining the expansions:\n$G(\\eta) \\approx \\left[ \\frac{1}{4}(G^{0}_{AA} + G^{0}_{BB} + 2G^{0}_{AB}) + \\frac{1}{4}\\Delta E \\eta^2 \\right] + \\left[ RT(-2\\ln(2) + \\eta^2) \\right]$\n$G(\\eta) \\approx \\left[ \\frac{1}{4}(G^{0}_{AA} + G^{0}_{BB} + 2G^{0}_{AB}) - 2RT\\ln(2) \\right] + \\left( \\frac{1}{4}\\Delta E + RT \\right)\\eta^2$\nThis is the Landau-like expansion of the Gibbs energy, $G(\\eta) \\approx G_0(T) + A(T)\\eta^2$, where $A(T) = \\frac{1}{4}\\Delta E + RT$.\n\n**4. Determine the Order-Disorder Transition Temperature ($T_c$)**\nThe disordered state ($\\eta=0$) is stable when it corresponds to a local minimum of the Gibbs energy, which requires the coefficient of the $\\eta^2$ term in the expansion to be positive, i.e., $A(T) > 0$. The order-disorder transition occurs when the disordered state loses its stability. The critical temperature $T_c$ corresponds to the point where this coefficient becomes zero.\n$A(T_c) = \\frac{1}{4}\\Delta E + RT_c = 0$\nSolving for $T_c$:\n$RT_c = -\\frac{1}{4}\\Delta E$\n$$T_c = -\\frac{\\Delta E}{4R}$$\n\n**5. Numerical Calculation of $T_c$**\nFirst, we calculate the site preference energy $\\Delta E$ using the provided numerical values:\n$\\Delta E = G^{0}_{AB} + G^{0}_{BA} - G^{0}_{AA} - G^{0}_{BB}$\n$\\Delta E = (-24.1 \\times 10^3) + (-24.1 \\times 10^3) - (-13.6 \\times 10^3) - (-12.9 \\times 10^3) \\, \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$\n$\\Delta E = (-48.2 + 13.6 + 12.9) \\times 10^3 \\, \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$\n$\\Delta E = (-48.2 + 26.5) \\times 10^3 \\, \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$\n$\\Delta E = -21.7 \\times 10^3 \\, \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$\n\nNext, we substitute this value into the expression for $T_c$:\n$T_c = -\\frac{-21.7 \\times 10^3 \\, \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}}{4 \\times 8.314 \\, \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}}$\n$T_c = \\frac{21700}{33.256} \\, \\mathrm{K}$\n$T_c \\approx 652.5138... \\, \\mathrm{K}$\n\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the transition temperature is:\n$T_c = 652.5 \\, \\mathrm{K}$",
