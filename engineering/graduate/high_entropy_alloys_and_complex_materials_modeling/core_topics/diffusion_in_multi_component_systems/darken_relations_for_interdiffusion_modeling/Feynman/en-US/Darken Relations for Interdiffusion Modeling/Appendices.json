It is based on established principles of solid-state diffusion, specifically the Darken model applied to a pseudo-binary system within a multi-component alloy, which is a standard approach in materials science. All necessary data are provided, and the task is to derive a relationship and perform a calculation, which is a valid scientific problem. Therefore, a solution is provided below.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the intrinsic diffusivity, $D_i$, and the calculation of the chemical interdiffusion coefficient, $\\tilde{D}$, in a pseudo-binary diffusion system.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the intrinsic diffusivity, $D_i$. The problem states that the flux of a component $i$ is described by linear irreversible thermodynamics as:\n$$J_{i} = - M_{i} N_{i} \\nabla \\mu_{i}$$\nwhere $M_i$ is the mobility, $N_i$ is the molar fraction, and $\\mu_i$ is the chemical potential of component $i$.\n\nThe chemical potential is given in terms of activity, $a_i$, as:\n$$\\mu_{i} = \\mu_{i}^{0}(T) + R T \\ln a_{i}$$\nHere, $\\mu_i^0(T)$ is the standard state chemical potential, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The gradient of the chemical potential is:\n$$\\nabla \\mu_{i} = \\nabla(\\mu_{i}^{0}(T) + R T \\ln a_{i}) = R T \\nabla(\\ln a_{i})$$\nsince $\\mu_i^0(T)$ is constant at a given temperature and has no spatial gradient.\n\nSubstituting this into the flux equation yields:\n$$J_{i} = - M_{i} N_{i} (R T \\nabla(\\ln a_{i})) = - (M_{i} R T) N_{i} \\nabla(\\ln a_{i})$$\nThe problem provides the Einstein relation connecting the tracer diffusivity, $D_i^*$, to the mobility:\n$$D_{i}^{*} = M_{i} R T$$\nSubstituting this into the flux expression gives:\n$$J_{i} = - D_{i}^{*} N_{i} \\nabla(\\ln a_{i})$$\nTo relate this to Fick's first law, we express the gradient of the logarithm of activity in terms of the gradient of the molar fraction. Using the chain rule, we can write $\\nabla(\\ln a_i)$ in terms of the mole fraction $N_i$. In the context of the pseudo-binary diffusion couple, the relevant compositional variable is the normalized fraction, $\\bar{N}_i$.\n$$\\nabla(\\ln a_{i}) = \\frac{d \\ln a_i}{d \\bar{N}_i} \\nabla \\bar{N}_i$$\nThe flux equation becomes:\n$$J_{i} = - D_{i}^{*} N_{i} \\frac{d \\ln a_i}{d \\bar{N}_i} \\nabla \\bar{N}_i$$\nFick's first law for the intrinsic flux of species $i$ (in a lattice reference frame, assuming constant molar volume such that the gradient of mole fraction is proportional to the gradient of concentration) is given by:\n$$J_{i} = - D_i \\nabla \\bar{N}_i$$\nNote that the flux $J_i$ in the initial equation is based on the chemical potential gradient and corresponds to the intrinsic flux. Comparing our derived expression for the flux with Fick's law, we can identify the intrinsic diffusivity, $D_i$.\nHowever, the standard definition of intrinsic diffusivity involves a thermodynamic factor that is a derivative with respect to $\\ln \\bar{N}_i$. We can rewrite the term $N_i \\frac{d \\ln a_i}{d \\bar{N}_i}$ as a derivative with respect to $\\ln \\bar{N}_i$. For the interacting pseudo-binary pair Ni and Co, $N_i \\approx \\bar{N}_i (\\sum N_k)$, where the sum is over the active species. A more direct formulation is to use the chain rule again:\n$$ \\frac{d \\ln a_i}{d \\bar{N}_i} = \\frac{d \\ln a_i}{d \\ln \\bar{N}_i} \\frac{d \\ln \\bar{N}_i}{d \\bar{N}_i} = \\frac{1}{\\bar{N}_i} \\frac{d \\ln a_i}{d \\ln \\bar{N}_i} $$\nThe flux is with respect to the overall composition space, and for a substitutional alloy $J_i$ is typically written with respect to $C_i$ or $N_i$. In the pseudo-binary framework, the flux divergence that drives interdiffusion is related to $\\nabla \\bar{N}_i$. The standard expression for intrinsic diffusivity is:\n$$D_i = D_i^* \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\ln a_i}{\\partial \\ln N_i} \\right)$$\nFor the pseudo-binary subspace, the relevant compositional variable is $\\bar{N}_i$, so the intrinsic diffusivity for component $i$ is correctly given by:\n$$D_i = D_{i}^{*} \\left( \\frac{d \\ln a_{i}}{d \\ln \\bar{N}_{i}} \\right)$$\nThe term $\\frac{d \\ln a_{i}}{d \\ln \\bar{N}_{i}}$ is the thermodynamic factor, which accounts for non-ideal thermodynamic interactions.\n\nThe second part of the problem is to compute the chemical interdiffusion coefficient, $\\tilde{D}$, using the Darken framework. For a binary system (or a pseudo-binary system like this one), the Darken equation relates the interdiffusion coefficient to the intrinsic diffusivities and the mole fractions of the components:\n$$\\tilde{D} = \\bar{N}_{\\mathrm{Co}} D_{\\mathrm{Ni}} + \\bar{N}_{\\mathrm{Ni}} D_{\\mathrm{Co}}$$\nwhere $\\bar{N}_{\\mathrm{Ni}}$ and $\\bar{N}_{\\mathrm{Co}}$ are the normalized mole fractions in the pseudo-binary subspace.\n\nNow, we proceed with the calculations.\nThe given molar fractions are $N_{\\mathrm{Ni}} = 0.22$ and $N_{\\mathrm{Co}} = 0.18$.\nFirst, we calculate the normalized pseudo-binary molar fractions:\n$$ \\bar{N}_{\\mathrm{Ni}} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{Ni}}}{N_{\\mathrm{Ni}} + N_{\\mathrm{Co}}} = \\frac{0.22}{0.22 + 0.18} = \\frac{0.22}{0.40} = 0.55 $$\n$$ \\bar{N}_{\\mathrm{Co}} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{Co}}}{N_{\\mathrm{Ni}} + N_{\\mathrm{Co}}} = \\frac{0.18}{0.22 + 0.18} = \\frac{0.18}{0.40} = 0.45 $$\nAs a check, $\\bar{N}_{\\mathrm{Ni}} + \\bar{N}_{\\mathrm{Co}} = 0.55 + 0.45 = 1.00$.\n\nNext, we calculate the intrinsic diffusivities for nickel ($ \\mathrm{Ni} $) and cobalt ($ \\mathrm{Co} $) using the provided tracer diffusivities and thermodynamic factors.\nFor Nickel:\n$$ D_{\\mathrm{Ni}} = D_{\\mathrm{Ni}}^{*} \\left( \\frac{d \\ln a_{\\mathrm{Ni}}}{d \\ln \\bar{N}_{\\mathrm{Ni}}} \\right) = (3.00 \\times 10^{-15} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}) \\times 1.30 = 3.90 \\times 10^{-15} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s} $$\nFor Cobalt:\n$$ D_{\\mathrm{Co}} = D_{\\mathrm{Co}}^{*} \\left( \\frac{d \\ln a_{\\mathrm{Co}}}{d \\ln \\bar{N}_{\\mathrm{Co}}} \\right) = (2.20 \\times 10^{-15} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}) \\times 1.38 = 3.036 \\times 10^{-15} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s} $$\n\nFinally, we use the Darken equation to compute the interdiffusion coefficient $\\tilde{D}$:\n$$ \\tilde{D} = \\bar{N}_{\\mathrm{Co}} D_{\\mathrm{Ni}} + \\bar{N}_{\\mathrm{Ni}} D_{\\mathrm{Co}} $$\n$$ \\tilde{D} = (0.45) \\times (3.90 \\times 10^{-15} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}) + (0.55) \\times (3.036 \\times 10^{-15} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}) $$\n$$ \\tilde{D} = (1.755 \\times 10^{-15} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}) + (1.6698 \\times 10^{-15} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}) $$\n$$ \\tilde{D} = 3.4248 \\times 10^{-15} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ \\tilde{D} \\approx 3.42 \\times 10^{-15} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s} $$",

Since $\\sum_i N_i = 1$, the compositional space can be reduced to three independent variables, $\\mathbf{x} = (N_A, N_B, N_C)$, with $N_D = 1 - N_A - N_B - N_C$.\n\nThe solution involves the following principal steps:\n1.  **Gibbs Free Energy Model**: The molar Gibbs free energy, $G(\\mathbf{N})$, is the sum of an ideal mixing term and a binary interaction (excess) term based on a Redlich-Kister-Muggianu model.\n    $$\n    G(\\mathbf{N}) = RT \\sum_{i} N_i \\ln N_i + \\sum_{i<j} N_i N_j \\left(L_{0,ij} + L_{1,ij} (N_i - N_j)\\right)\n    $$\n    All parameters ($L_{0,ij}$, $L_{1,ij}$, $R$, $T$) are provided.\n\n2.  **Tracer Diffusivity Model**: The tracer diffusivity of each component, $D_i^*$, is given as a composition-dependent function:\n    $$\n    D_i^*(\\mathbf{N}) = D_{0,i}\\,\\exp\\left(\\beta_i (N_i - 0.25) + \\sum_{j \\neq i} \\gamma_{ij} (N_j - 0.25)\\right)\n    $$\n    All parameters ($D_{0,i}$, $\\beta_i$, $\\gamma_{ij}$) are provided.\n\n3.  **Thermodynamic Factor Matrix ($B$)**: The thermodynamic factor matrix, $B(\\mathbf{x})$, quantifies how chemical potentials change with composition. It is defined as the Hessian of the Gibbs free energy in the reduced compositional space:\n    $$\n    B_{ij}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{\\partial^2 G}{\\partial x_i \\partial x_j}, \\quad i,j \\in \\{A,B,C\\}\n    $$\n    As specified, this $3 \\times 3$ matrix will be computed numerically using a central finite-difference scheme with a step size $h = 10^{-6}$. For any evaluation of $G$, the mole fractions must be kept positive and normalized. This is achieved by clipping any $N_k < 10^{-12}$ to $10^{-12}$ and renormalizing the vector $\\mathbf{N}$ to sum to $1$. The formulas for the second derivatives are:\n    -   Diagonal elements: $\\frac{\\partial^2 G}{\\partial x_i^2} \\approx \\frac{G(\\mathbf{x} + h\\mathbf{e}_i) - 2G(\\mathbf{x}) + G(\\mathbf{x} - h\\mathbf{e}_i)}{h^2}$\n    -   Off-diagonal elements: $\\frac{\\partial^2 G}{\\partial x_i \\partial x_j} \\approx \\frac{G(\\mathbf{x} + h\\mathbf{e}_i + h\\mathbf{e}_j) - G(\\mathbf{x} + h\\mathbf{e}_i - h\\mathbf{e}_j) - G(\\mathbf{x} - h\\mathbf{e}_i + h\\mathbf{e}_j) + G(\\mathbf{x} - h\\mathbf{e}_i - h\\mathbf{e}_j)}{4h^2}$\n\n4.  **Kinetic Factor Matrix ($M_0$)**: A diagonal matrix $M_0(\\mathbf{x})$ is constructed from the mobilities of the first three components:\n    $$\n    M_0(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathrm{diag}\\left(N_A D_A^*(\\mathbf{N}),\\ N_B D_B^*(\\mathbf{N}),\\ N_C D_C^*(\\mathbf{N})\\right)\n    $$\n\n5.  **Reduced Interdiffusion Matrix ($\\tilde{D}$)**: The interdiffusion matrix relates diffusion fluxes to composition gradients. It is calculated by combining the kinetic and thermodynamic factors:\n    $$\n    \\tilde{D}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{1}{RT}\\, M_0(\\mathbf{x})\\, B(\\mathbf{x})\n    $$\n\n6.  **Effective Interdiffusion Coefficient ($\\tilde{D}_{\\text{eff}}$)**: For a given compositional path $\\mathbf{x}(s) = \\mathbf{x}_0 + s(\\mathbf{x}_1 - \\mathbf{x}_0)$ with tangent vector $\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{x}_1 - \\mathbf{x}_0$, the effective interdiffusion coefficient along this direction is the projection of the diffusion tensor onto the path, calculated via a Rayleigh quotient:\n    $$\n    \\tilde{D}_{\\text{eff}}(\\mathbf{x}(s),\\mathbf{v}) = \\frac{\\mathbf{v}^\\top \\tilde{D}(\\mathbf{x}(s))\\, \\mathbf{v}}{\\mathbf{v}^\\top \\mathbf{v}}\n    $$\n    This value is computed for $s \\in \\{0, 0.5, 1\\}$ for each test case and rounded to six significant digits.\n\n7.  **Sensitivity Analysis**: To determine whether kinetics or thermodynamics dominate the diffusion process, sensitivities $S_k$ and $S_t$ are computed. These are defined as finite-difference approximations to the logarithmic derivatives of $\\tilde{D}_{\\text{eff}}$ with respect to uniform scaling of the $M_0$ and $B$ matrices, respectively.\n    $$\n    S_k = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\tilde{D}_{\\text{eff}}((1+\\varepsilon)M_0, B)\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\tilde{D}_{\\text{eff}}(M_0,B)\\right)}{\\ln(1+\\varepsilon)}\n    $$\n    $$\n    S_t = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\tilde{D}_{\\text{eff}}(M_0, (1+\\varepsilon)B)\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\tilde{D}_{\\text{eff}}(M_0,B)\\right)}{\\ln(1+\\varepsilon)}\n    $$\n    Analytically, since $\\tilde{D}_{\\text{eff}}$ is linearly proportional to both $M_0$ and $B$, both sensitivities $S_k$ and $S_t$ are exactly equal to $1$. This is because for a function $f(\\lambda M_0) = \\lambda f(M_0)$, the logarithmic derivative is $\\frac{\\ln(f(\\lambda M_0)) - \\ln(f(M_0))}{\\ln(\\lambda)} = \\frac{\\ln(\\lambda f(M_0)) - \\ln(f(M_0))}{\\ln(\\lambda)} = \\frac{\\ln \\lambda + \\ln f - \\ln f}{\\ln \\lambda} = 1$. The same logic applies to scaling $B$. Consequently, the condition $S_k > S_t$ will always evaluate to `False`. The boolean flag $\\text{kinetic\\_dominant}(s)$ is set based on this comparison.\n\nThe implementation will consist of separate functions for each physical quantity, a numerical differentiation routine for the Hessian, and a main loop to process the specified test cases and path points.",
