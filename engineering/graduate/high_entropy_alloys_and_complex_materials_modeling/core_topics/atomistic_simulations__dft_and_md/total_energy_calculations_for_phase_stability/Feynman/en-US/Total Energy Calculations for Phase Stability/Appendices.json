This first practice provides a direct application of this principle by tasking you with determining the relative stability of two common crystal structures, Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) and Body-Centered Cubic (BCC). By fitting discrete energy-versus-volume data to a continuous model, you will gain hands-on experience in a fundamental workflow: locating the equilibrium volume and minimum energy for competing phases to identify the ground state structure .",

            "problem": "You are given discrete total-energy versus volume data for Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) and Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) crystal structures of a single equiatomic high-entropy alloy. Assume the Born–Oppenheimer approximation holds and the total electronic energy at fixed atomic positions defines a well-behaved equation of state near equilibrium. In the vicinity of the minimum, approximate the total energy as a cubic polynomial in volume, and determine the minimum-energy volume by calculus principles.\n\nStarting from the following foundational bases:\n- The Born–Oppenheimer approximation asserts that the total electronic energy at fixed nuclei positions defines a potential energy surface for the atoms.\n- Near a stable equilibrium volume, the total energy as a function of volume can be approximated by a low-order Taylor series. For practical fitting over a finite volume window, model the energy by a cubic polynomial in volume, i.e., fit $$E(V) = a_3 V^3 + a_2 V^2 + a_1 V + a_0$$ using linear least squares, where $$E$$ is energy and $$V$$ is volume.\n- The equilibrium volume is given by the stationarity condition $$\\frac{dE}{dV} = 0$$ with the positive curvature condition $$\\frac{d^2E}{dV^2} > 0$$ for a minimum. If the computed stationary point lies outside the sampled interval, or does not satisfy the curvature condition in the sampled interval, select the minimum energy among the interval endpoints.\n\nImplement a program that, for each test case below:\n1. Fits a cubic polynomial $$E(V)$$ independently to the FCC and BCC datasets by minimizing the sum of squared residuals.\n2. Finds the minimizing volume $$V^\\star$$ within the sampled interval by solving $$\\frac{dE}{dV} = 0$$ and testing $$\\frac{d^2E}{dV^2} > 0$$, else uses the endpoint with the lowest energy.\n3.

            "solution": "The posed problem requires the determination of the relative phase stability between the Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) and Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) crystal structures of a high-entropy alloy. This is accomplished by calculating the difference in their minimum total energies, $\\Delta E = E^\\text{FCC}_\\text{min} - E^\\text{BCC}_\\text{min}$. The foundation of this analysis rests on the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, which allows the total energy to be expressed as a function of atomic volume, $E(V)$. The provided discrete energy-volume data for each phase must be fitted to a continuous model to accurately locate the energy minimum.\n\nThe procedure for each crystal structure involves two principal stages: fitting the discrete data to a cubic polynomial and subsequently finding the minimum of this polynomial function under the specified constraints.\n\nStep 1: Cubic Polynomial Fitting via Linear Least Squares\nGiven a set of $N$ discrete data points representing volume and energy, $(V_i, E_i)$ for $i = 1, \\dots, N$, we are tasked with modeling the energy-volume relationship using a cubic polynomial of the form:\n$$\nE(V) = a_3 V^3 + a_2 V^2 + a_1 V + a_0\n$$\nThe coefficients $\\mathbf{c} = [a_3, a_2, a_1, a_0]^T$ are determined by minimizing the sum of the squared residuals, $S$, which is the difference between the observed energies $E_i$ and the energies predicted by the polynomial $E(V_i)$:\n$$\nS = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} [E_i - (a_3 V_i^3 + a_2 V_i^2 + a_1 V_i + a_0)]^2\n$$\nThis minimization is a standard linear least-squares problem. It can be expressed in matrix algebra as minimizing the Euclidean norm of the residual vector, $\\|\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{c} - \\mathbf{E}\\|_2^2$. Here, $\\mathbf{E}$ is the vector of the given energy values, and $\\mathbf{A}$ is the Vandermonde matrix constructed from the volume data:\n$$\n\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix}\nV_1^3 & V_1^2 & V_1 & 1 \\\\\nV_2^3 & V_2^2 & V_2 & 1 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\nV_N^3 & V_N^2 & V_N & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n\\mathbf{E} = \\begin{pmatrix}\nE_1 \\\\\nE_2 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nE_N\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis system is robustly solved using standard numerical linear algebra routines, such as those provided by the `numpy` library in Python, which compute the coefficient vector $\\mathbf{c}$.\n\nStep 2: Locating the Minimum Energy\nWith the continuous function $E(V)$ established, the next step is to find the volume $V^\\star$ at which the energy is minimized. The principles of differential calculus dictate that a minimum must occur at a stationary point, where the first derivative of the function with respect to volume is zero. The stability of this point (i.e., whether it is a minimum, maximum, or inflection point) is determined by the sign of the second derivative.\n\nThe first derivative of the energy polynomial is:\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dV} = 3a_3 V^2 + 2a_2 V + a_1\n$$\nEquating this to zero, $\\frac{dE}{dV} = 0$, yields a quadratic equation for the volume $V$. The roots of this equation, representing the stationary points, are found using the quadratic formula:\n$$\nV_\\text{stationary} = \\frac{-2a_2 \\pm \\sqrt{(2a_2)^2 - 4(3a_3)(a_1)}}{2(3a_3)} = \\frac{-a_2 \\pm \\sqrt{a_2^2 - 3a_1 a_3}}{3a_3}\n$$\nA physically valid minimum must satisfy several conditions:\n1.  The root $V_\\text{stationary}$ must be a real number, which requires the discriminant $a_2^2 - 3a_1 a_3 \\ge 0$.\n2.  The stationary point must correspond to a local minimum, which is confirmed by a positive second derivative:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d^2E}{dV^2} = 6a_3 V + 2a_2 > 0\n    $$\n3.  The volume $V^\\star$ that minimizes the energy must lie within the closed interval defined by the minimum and maximum sampled volumes, $V^\\star \\in [V_\\text{min\\_data}, V_\\text{max\\_data}]$.\n\nOur algorithm will find all real roots of $\\frac{dE}{dV} = 0$. For each root that falls within the data interval, we test the second derivative condition. If one or more such minima are found, we select the volume that corresponds to the absolute lowest energy value.\n\nAs per the problem statement, if no stationary point satisfying these conditions exists within the sampled interval, the minimum energy over this interval must occur at one of its boundaries. In such a scenario, we evaluate the fitted polynomial $E(V)$ at the endpoints, $V_\\text{min\\_data}$ and $V_\\text{max\\_data}$, and the minimum energy is taken as the smaller of these two values:\n$$\nE_\\text{min} = \\min(E(V_\\text{min\\_data}), E(V_\\text{max\\_data}))\n$$\nThis procedure correctly identifies the global minimum of the fitted polynomial over the specified closed interval.\n\nFinal Calculation\nThis entire process is executed independently for both the FCC and BCC datasets for each test case, yielding their respective minimum energies, $E^\\text{FCC}_\\text{min}$ and $E^\\text{BCC}_\\text{min}$. The final value to be reported is their difference:\n$$\n\\Delta E = E^\\text{FCC}_\\text{min} - E^\\text{BCC}_\\text{min}\n$$\nThe sign of $\\Delta E$ indicates the relative stability: if $\\Delta E  0$, the FCC phase is more stable; if $\\Delta E > 0$, the BCC phase is more stable.",

The algorithm must start from the harmonic approximation of the total energy and the definition of the dynamical matrix. You must not rely on pre-derived dispersion formulas; instead, you must construct the dynamical matrix by Fourier transforming real-space harmonic force constants and then diagonalize it to obtain phonon frequencies from first principles.\n\nFundamental base:\n- Under the harmonic approximation, the total energy $E$ of small displacements about a reference structure is expanded as\n$$\nE \\approx E_0 + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i\\alpha,j\\beta} \\Phi_{i\\alpha,j\\beta} \\, u_{i\\alpha} \\, u_{j\\beta},\n$$\nwhere $u_{i\\alpha}$ is the displacement of atom $i$ in Cartesian direction $\\alpha$, and $\\Phi_{i\\alpha,j\\beta}$ is the force-constant (second derivative of the total energy).\n- The dynamical matrix $D(\\mathbf{q})$ at wave vector $\\mathbf{q}$ is defined by the lattice Fourier transform of the mass-weighted force constants,\n$$\nD_{i\\alpha,j\\beta}(\\mathbf{q}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m_i m_j}} \\sum_{\\mathbf{R}} \\Phi_{i\\alpha,j\\beta}(\\mathbf{R}) \\, e^{i \\mathbf{q}\\cdot \\mathbf{R}},\n$$\nwhere $m_i$ is the mass of atom $i$ and $\\Phi_{i\\alpha,j\\beta}(\\mathbf{R})$ couples the reference cell to a cell displaced by lattice vector $\\mathbf{R}$.

            "solution": "The problem of determining the stability of a crystal lattice is fundamental to condensed matter physics and materials science. A given atomic arrangement is structurally stable only if it corresponds to a local minimum of the total potential energy. Small displacements of atoms from their equilibrium positions must lead to an increase in energy. In the harmonic approximation, the potential energy surface is expanded to second order around the equilibrium configuration, providing a quadratic energy landscape. The stability is then determined by the signs of the curvatures of this landscape.\n\nThe total energy $E$ for small atomic displacements $u_{i\\alpha}$ (displacement of atom $i$ in direction $\\alpha$) is given by:\n$$\nE \\approx E_0 + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i\\alpha,j\\beta} \\Phi_{i\\alpha,j\\beta} u_{i\\alpha} u_{j\\beta}\n$$\nHere, $E_0$ is the energy of the static reference lattice, and $\\Phi_{i\\alpha,j\\beta} = \\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial u_{i\\alpha} \\partial u_{j\\beta}}$ is the Hessian matrix, or the matrix of harmonic force constants. For a stable structure, this quadratic form must be positive definite, meaning all its eigenvalues are positive.\n\nThe collective vibrations of the atoms in a periodic lattice are described by phonons. The equations of motion for the atoms, derived from the harmonic potential, are best solved by transforming into reciprocal space. This procedure block-diagonalizes the problem by wave vector $\\mathbf{q}$. For each $\\mathbf{q}$, we solve an eigenvalue problem for a small matrix known as the dynamical matrix, $D(\\mathbf{q})$. Its elements are the mass-weighted Fourier transform of the real-space force constants:\n$$\nD_{s\\alpha,s'\\beta}(\\mathbf{q}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m_s m_{s'}}} \\sum_{\\mathbf{R}} \\Phi_{s\\alpha,s'\\beta}(\\mathbf{R}) e^{i \\mathbf{q}\\cdot \\mathbf{R}}\n$$\nwhere $s$ and $s'$ index atoms within a unit cell, $m_s$ is the mass of atom $s$, and the sum is over all lattice vectors $\\mathbf{R}$. The eigenvalues of $D(\\mathbf{q})$ are the squared phonon frequencies, $\\omega^2(\\mathbf{q})$.\n$$\nD(\\mathbf{q}) \\mathbf{e}(\\mathbf{q}) = \\omega^2(\\mathbf{q}) \\mathbf{e}(\\mathbf{q})\n$$\nThe physical significance of the eigenvalues determines stability:\n- If $\\omega^2(\\mathbf{q}) > 0$, the frequency $\\omega(\\mathbf{q})$ is real, corresponding to a stable, propagating vibrational mode (a phonon).\n- If $\\omega^2(\\mathbf{q})  0$, the frequency $\\omega(\\mathbf{q})$ is imaginary. This indicates that a small displacement will grow exponentially in time, rather than oscillate. This is a dynamic instability known as a \"soft mode\", and it signals that the initial atomic structure is unstable and will spontaneously distort.\n\nThe problem requires us to apply this formalism to a one-dimensional diatomic chain with atoms of mass $m_0$ and $m_1$ in each unit cell. The lattice constant is $a$. We consider only nearest-neighbor interactions with an intracell spring constant $k_0$ and an intercell spring constant $k_1$. Following the rules for constructing force constants from pair potentials, the non-zero force constants $\\Phi_{ss'}(n)$ (coupling atom $s$ in the reference cell $0$ to atom $s'$ in cell $n$) are provided.\n\nThe dynamical matrix for this 1D model is a $2 \\times 2$ Hermitian matrix, whose components are given as:\n$$\nD_{00}(q) = \\frac{k_0 + k_1}{m_0}\n$$\n$$\nD_{11}(q) = \\frac{k_0 + k_1}{m_1}\n$$\n$$\nD_{01}(q) = \\frac{-k_0 - k_1 e^{-i q a}}{\\sqrt{m_0 m_1}}\n$$\n$$\nD_{10}(q) = \\frac{-k_0 - k_1 e^{+i q a}}{\\sqrt{m_0 m_1}}\n$$\nNote that $D_{10}(q) = D_{01}^*(q)$, confirming the Hermitian property.\n\nThe computational procedure is to implement the calculation for the given test cases. For each case, we will:\n1. Define the physical constants and model parameters $(m_0, m_1, a, k_0, k_1)$. Masses, given in atomic mass units ($\\text{u}$), must be converted to kilograms ($\\text{kg}$) using the provided conversion factor.\n2. Generate a uniform grid of $N_q$ wave vectors $q$ in the interval $[0, \\pi/a]$, which covers the irreducible part of the first Brillouin zone.\n3. Iterate through each value of $q$ in the grid.\n4. At each $q$, construct the complex-valued $2 \\times 2$ dynamical matrix $D(q)$ using the formulas above.\n5. Compute the two eigenvalues of $D(q)$. Since $D(q)$ is Hermitian, its eigenvalues ($\\omega^2$) are guaranteed to be real.\n6. Check if either eigenvalue is negative, specifically less than a small negative threshold $-\\epsilon$ (where $\\epsilon = 10^{-12}$) to robustly detect instabilities while avoiding false positives from floating-point inaccuracies around zero.\n7. If a negative eigenvalue is found for any $q$, we conclude that a soft mode exists for the given set of parameters. We can then stop checking further $q$ values for that case and record the result as `True`.\n8. If the loop completes without finding any negative eigenvalues, the system is stable, and the result is `False`.\n9. The final output aggregates the boolean results for all test cases.\n\nThis process directly simulates the physical principles of lattice dynamics to assess structural stability, as required.",
