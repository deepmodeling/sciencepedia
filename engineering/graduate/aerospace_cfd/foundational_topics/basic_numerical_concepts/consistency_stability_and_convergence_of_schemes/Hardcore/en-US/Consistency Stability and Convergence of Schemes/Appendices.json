This exercise introduces the powerful technique of modified equation analysis, which uses Taylor series expansions to reveal the equation a scheme *actually* solves. By deriving the modified equation for the first-order upwind scheme, you will uncover the \"hidden\" physics of numerical dissipation and gain a deeper understanding of how discretization errors manifest as physical-like terms .",

On a uniform spatial grid with spacing $\\Delta x$, define the semi-discrete first-order upwind finite-difference approximation to the spatial derivative at grid point $x_{i}$ by replacing $u_{x}(x_{i},t)$ with $\\left(u_{i}(t) - u_{i-1}(t)\\right)/\\Delta x$, where $u_{i}(t) = u(x_{i},t)$ and $x_{i} = i\\,\\Delta x$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the modified partial differential equation for a semi-discrete, first-order upwind scheme applied to the one-dimensional linear advection equation. From this modified equation, we must identify the leading-order artificial diffusion term.\n\nThe given partial differential equation (PDE) is the linear advection equation:\n$$u_{t} + a\\,u_{x} = 0$$\nwhere $u=u(x,t)$, $u_t = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}$, $u_x = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$, and the advection speed $a$ is a positive constant ($a  0$).\n\nThe problem defines a semi-discrete numerical scheme on a uniform grid with spacing $\\Delta x$. At each grid point $x_i$, the spatial derivative $u_x$ is approximated by the first-order upwind finite difference formula. Since $a  0$, the \"upwind\" direction is the negative $x$ direction, involving grid points $i$ and $i-1$. The scheme is given as:\n$$\\frac{d u_{i}(t)}{dt} + a\\,\\frac{u_{i}(t) - u_{i-1}(t)}{\\Delta x} = 0$$\nHere, $u_i(t)$ represents the numerical solution at grid point $x_i$ as a function of continuous time $t$, so $\\frac{d u_{i}(t)}{dt}$ is equivalent to evaluating the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}$ at $x_i$. We can write the scheme using partial derivative notation at the point $(x_i, t)$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + a\\,\\left(\\frac{u(x_i, t) - u(x_i - \\Delta x, t)}{\\Delta x}\\right) = 0$$\n\nTo find the modified equation that this scheme actually solves, we analyze the truncation error of the finite difference approximation. We perform a Taylor series expansion of the term $u(x_i - \\Delta x, t)$ about the point $x_i$:\n$$u(x_i - \\Delta x, t) = u(x_i, t) - (\\Delta x)\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x_i} + \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{2!}\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\\bigg|_{x_i} - \\frac{(\\Delta x)^3}{3!}\\frac{\\partial^3 u}{\\partial x^3}\\bigg|_{x_i} + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta x^4)$$\nFor clarity, we adopt the subscript notation for partial derivatives evaluated at $(x_i, t)$, e.g., $u_x = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\\big|_{x_i}$, $u_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\\big|_{x_i}$, and so on. The expansion becomes:\n$$u(x_i - \\Delta x, t) = u(x_i, t) - \\Delta x \\, u_x + \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{2} u_{xx} - \\frac{(\\Delta x)^3}{6} u_{xxx} + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta x^4)$$\n\nNow, we substitute this expansion into the finite difference operator from the scheme:\n$$\\frac{u(x_i, t) - u(x_i - \\Delta x, t)}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta x} \\left[ u(x_i, t) - \\left( u(x_i, t) - \\Delta x \\, u_x + \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{2} u_{xx} - \\frac{(\\Delta x)^3}{6} u_{xxx} + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta x^4) \\right) \\right]$$\nSimplifying the expression inside the brackets:\n$$\\frac{u(x_i, t) - u(x_i - \\Delta x, t)}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta x} \\left[ \\Delta x \\, u_x - \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{2} u_{xx} + \\frac{(\\Delta x)^3}{6} u_{xxx} - \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta x^4) \\right]$$\nDividing by $\\Delta x$, we obtain the continuous representation of the discrete spatial derivative operator:\n$$\\frac{u(x_i, t) - u(x_i - \\Delta x, t)}{\\Delta x} = u_x - \\frac{\\Delta x}{2} u_{xx} + \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{6} u_{xxx} + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta x^3)$$\n\nNext, we substitute this result back into the semi-discrete scheme. Dropping the explicit evaluation at $x_i$ for notational convenience, we are now describing the behavior of the solution on a continuous domain:\n$$u_t + a \\left( u_x - \\frac{\\Delta x}{2} u_{xx} + \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{6} u_{xxx} + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta x^3) \\right) = 0$$\nDistributing the constant $a$:\n$$u_t + a u_x - a \\frac{\\Delta x}{2} u_{xx} + a \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{6} u_{xxx} + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta x^3) = 0$$\n\nThis is the modified partial differential equation solved by the scheme, including terms up to order $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta x^2)$. To better see the relationship with the original PDE, we rearrange the equation:\n$$u_t + a u_x = a \\frac{\\Delta x}{2} u_{xx} - a \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{6} u_{xxx} - \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta x^3)$$\n\nThe left side, $u_t + a u_x$, is the original PDE, which should be equal to $0$. The right side represents the truncation error of the scheme. The modified equation shows that the numerical solution does not satisfy the original PDE exactly, but rather satisfies a different PDE that includes these error terms.\n\nThe leading term of the truncation error is the term with the lowest power of $\\Delta x$, which is $a \\frac{\\Delta x}{2} u_{xx}$. This term is of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta x)$. It involves a second-order spatial derivative, $u_{xx}$, which is characteristic of physical diffusion or viscous dissipation phenomena (e.g., the heat equation, $u_t = \\nu u_{xx}$). Because this term is an artifact of the numerical method and not part of the original physical model, it is referred to as \"artificial diffusion\" or \"numerical diffusion\". The coefficient $a \\frac{\\Delta x}{2}$ is the artificial diffusion coefficient. Since $a  0$ and $\\Delta x  0$, this coefficient is positive, indicating that the scheme introduces a dissipative effect that tends to smooth out sharp gradients in the solution.\n\nThe problem asks to identify this \"leading-order artificial diffusion term\". Based on our analysis, this term is precisely the leading term of the truncation error.\n\nThe artificial diffusion term is therefore $a \\frac{\\Delta x}{2} u_{xx}$.",

A general linear $k$-step method is given by $\\sum_{j=0}^{k} \\alpha_j y_{n+j} = \\Delta t \\sum_{j=0}^{k} \\beta_j f_{n+j}$.

The coefficients for the first characteristic polynomial, $\\rho(\\zeta)$, are $\\alpha_2=1$, $\\alpha_1=-1$, and $\\alpha_0=0$. The polynomial is\n$$\\rho(\\zeta) = \\sum_{j=0}^{2} \\alpha_j \\zeta^j = \\alpha_2 \\zeta^2 + \\alpha_1 \\zeta^1 + \\alpha_0 \\zeta^0 = \\zeta^2 - \\zeta$$\nZero-stability requires that all roots of $\\rho(\\zeta) = 0$ must satisfy the root condition: they must lie within or on the unit circle in the complex plane, and any roots on the unit circle must be simple (i.e., have multiplicity one). The roots of $\\rho(\\zeta) = \\zeta(\\zeta-1) = 0$ are $\\zeta_1=1$ and $\\zeta_2=0$. The root $\\zeta_1=1$ lies on the unit circle ($|\\zeta_1|=1$) and is simple. The root $\\zeta_2=0$ lies strictly inside the unit circle ($|\\zeta_2|1$). Therefore, the root condition is satisfied, and the AB2 method is zero-stable.\n\nNext, we determine the stability constraint imposed by the method-of-lines approach. This requires analyzing the absolute stability of the AB2 method when applied to the test equation $y' = \\lambda y$, for which $f = \\lambda y$. The eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of the spatial operator $\\mathbf{L}$ are real and non-positive. We substitute $f_n = \\lambda y_n$ into the AB2 formula:\n$$y_{n+1} = y_{n} + \\Delta t \\left(\\frac{3}{2} \\lambda y_{n} - \\frac{1}{2} \\lambda y_{n-1}\\right)$$\nLet $z = \\lambda \\Delta t$.

The region of absolute stability is the set of complex numbers $z$ for which this condition holds.\n\nNow we determine the spectrum of the spatial discretization operator $\\mathbf{L}$. The semi-discrete system is $\\frac{dy_j}{dt} = \\nu \\frac{y_{j+1} - 2y_j + y_{j-1}}{h^2}$. We use a von Neumann (Fourier) analysis, substituting a single mode $y_j(t) = \\hat{y}(t) e^{i \\kappa x_j}$ where $x_j=jh$ and $\\kappa$ is the wavenumber.\n$$\\frac{d\\hat{y}}{dt} e^{i \\kappa j h} = \\frac{\\nu}{h^2} \\hat{y}(t) \\left(e^{i \\kappa (j+1)h} - 2e^{i \\kappa j h} + e^{i \\kappa (j-1)h}\\right)$$\nDividing by $\\hat{y}(t)e^{i\\kappa jh}$ gives the ODE for the modal amplitude $\\hat{y}(t)$:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\hat{y}}\\frac{d\\hat{y}}{dt} = \\frac{\\nu}{h^2} \\left(e^{i \\kappa h} - 2 + e^{-i \\kappa h}\\right)$$\nThe term on the right is the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ associated with the wavenumber $\\kappa$. Using $e^{i\\theta}+e^{-i\\theta} = 2\\cos\\theta$, we get:\n$$\\lambda(\\kappa) = \\frac{2\\nu}{h^2} (\\cos(\\kappa h) - 1)$$\nUsing the identity $1-\\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$, this becomes:\n$$\\lambda(\\kappa) = -\\frac{4\\nu}{h^2} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\kappa h}{2}\\right)$$\nThese eigenvalues are all real and non-positive. The most restrictive stability condition arises from the eigenvalue with the largest magnitude, which corresponds to the highest frequency mode the grid can resolve. This occurs when $\\sin^2(\\kappa h/2)$ is maximized, i.e., $\\sin^2(\\kappa h / 2) = 1$. This corresponds to the Nyquist frequency, where $\\kappa h = \\pi$. The most negative eigenvalue is thus:\n$$\\lambda_{\\min} = -\\frac{4\\nu}{h^2}$$\n\nFinally, we combine these results. For stability of the fully-discrete scheme, the quantity $z = \\lambda \\Delta t$ must lie in the absolute stability region of the AB2 method for all eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $\\mathbf{L}$. Since all $\\lambda$ are real and negative, we only need to find the interval of stability on the negative real axis. The stability boundary is where a root of the stability polynomial $\\xi^2 - (1 + \\frac{3}{2}z)\\xi + \\frac{1}{2}z = 0$ satisfies $|\\xi|=1$. The interval on the negative real axis terminates when one of the roots is $\\xi = -1$. Substituting this into the polynomial:\n$$(-1)^2 - \\left(1 + \\frac{3}{2}z\\right)(-1) + \\frac{1}{2}z = 0$$\n$$1 + \\left(1 + \\frac{3}{2}z\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}z = 0$$\n$$2 + 2z = 0 \\implies z = -1$$\nThus, the region of absolute stability for AB2 along the negative real axis is the interval $[-1, 0]$.\nThe stability requirement is that the scaled eigenvalues, $z = \\lambda \\Delta t$, must all lie in this interval. The most restrictive condition comes from $\\lambda_{\\min}$:\n$$z_{\\min} = \\lambda_{\\min} \\Delta t \\ge -1$$\n$$\\left(-\\frac{4\\nu}{h^2}\\right)\\Delta t \\ge -1$$\nMultiplying by $-1$ and reversing the inequality sign:\n$$\\frac{4\\nu \\Delta t}{h^2} \\le 1$$\nThe problem defines the non-dimensional time-step factor as $C = \\nu \\Delta t / h^2$. Substituting this into the inequality gives:\n$$4C \\le 1$$\n$$C \\le \\frac{1}{4}$$\nThe maximal admissible value for this non-dimensional time-step factor is therefore $C_{\\max} = 1/4$.",
