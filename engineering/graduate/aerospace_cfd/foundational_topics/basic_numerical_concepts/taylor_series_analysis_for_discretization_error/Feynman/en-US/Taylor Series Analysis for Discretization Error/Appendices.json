Derivation of the Leading Error Constant, $C$**\n\nUsing the equation for the difference between the two finest mesh solutions, we can express $C$:\n$$\nJ_2 - J_3 = C(h_{2}^{p} - h_{3}^{p})\n$$\n$$\nC = \\frac{J_2 - J_3}{h_{2}^{p} - h_{3}^{p}}\n$$\nSubstituting $h_2 = r h_3$ and the estimated value $p=2$:\n$$\nC = \\frac{J_2 - J_3}{(r h_3)^{2} - h_{3}^{2}} = \\frac{J_2 - J_3}{h_{3}^{2}(r^2 - 1)}\n$$\nSince the value of $h_3$ is not specified, $C$ is expressed in terms of $h_3$. This constitutes the method requested. Its units would be $[L^{-p}]$, where $L$ is length, which is consistent with the model where $J$ is dimensionless.\n\n**3. Richardson Extrapolation $J_R(p)$ and its Sensitivity $\\partial J_R/\\partial p$**\n\nRichardson extrapolation provides an estimate of the continuum value $J^{*}$ by canceling the leading-order error term. Using the two finest meshes ($h_2, h_3$):\n$J_2 = J^{*} + C h_{2}^{p}$\n$J_3 = J^{*} + C h_{3}^{p}$\nSubstitute $h_2 = r h_3$, which gives $h_2^p = r^p h_3^p$. The system becomes:\n$J_2 = J^{*} + C r^p h_{3}^{p}$\n$J_3 = J^{*} + C h_{3}^{p}$\nTo eliminate the term with $C$, multiply the second equation by $r^p$ and subtract the first equation from the result:\n$r^p J_3 - J_2 = (r^p J^{*} + r^p C h_3^p) - (J^{*} + C r^p h_3^p) = r^p J^{*} - J^{*} = J^{*}(r^p - 1)$\nThe extrapolated value, denoted $J_R(p)$, is the resulting estimate for $J^{*}$:\n$$\nJ_R(p) = \\frac{r^p J_3 - J_2}{r^p - 1}\n$$\nThis expression can be conveniently rewritten as:\n$$\nJ_R(p) = \\frac{(r^p - 1)J_3 + J_3 - J_2}{r^p - 1} = J_3 + \\frac{J_3 - J_2}{r^p - 1}\n$$\nThis form is preferable for differentiation with respect to $p$. The quantities $J_2$, $J_3$, and $r$ are constants in this context.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial J_R}{\\partial p} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p} \\left( J_3 + \\frac{J_3 - J_2}{r^p - 1} \\right) = (J_3 - J_2) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p} (r^p - 1)^{-1}\n$$\nUsing the chain rule, where $\\frac{d}{dp}(r^p) = r^p \\ln(r)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial J_R}{\\partial p} = (J_3 - J_2) \\left[ -1 \\cdot (r^p - 1)^{-2} \\cdot (r^p \\ln(r)) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial J_R}{\\partial p} = - (J_3 - J_2) \\frac{r^p \\ln(r)}{(r^p - 1)^2} = (J_2 - J_3) \\frac{r^p \\ln(r)}{(r^p - 1)^2}\n$$\n\n**4. Evaluation of the Relative Condition Number, $\\kappa_p$**\n\nThe relative condition number is defined as $\\kappa_{p} = \\left|\\frac{\\partial J_{R}}{\\partial p}\\frac{p}{J_{R}}\\right|$. We now evaluate the components at the estimated value $p=2$, using $r=2$, $J_2=0.2330$, and $J_3=0.23225$.\n\nFirst, calculate the extrapolated value $J_R(2)$:\n$$\nJ_R(2) = J_3 + \\frac{J_3 - J_2}{r^2 - 1} = 0.23225 + \\frac{0.23225 - 0.2330}{2^2 - 1} = 0.23225 + \\frac{-0.00075}{3}\n$$\n$$\nJ_R(2) = 0.23225 - 0.00025 = 0.23200\n$$\nNext, calculate the sensitivity $\\frac{\\partial J_R}{\\partial p}$ at $p=2$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial J_R}{\\partial p}\\bigg|_{p=2} = (J_2 - J_3) \\frac{r^p \\ln(r)}{(r^p - 1)^2} \\bigg|_{p=2} = (0.2330 - 0.23225) \\frac{2^2 \\ln(2)}{(2^2 - 1)^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial J_R}{\\partial p}\\bigg|_{p=2} = (0.00075) \\frac{4 \\ln(2)}{3^2} = \\frac{0.003 \\ln(2)}{9} = \\frac{0.001 \\ln(2)}{3}\n$$\nFinally, compute the condition number $\\kappa_p$:\n$$\n\\kappa_p = \\left| \\left( \\frac{0.001 \\ln(2)}{3} \\right) \\frac{2}{0.23200} \\right|\n$$\nSince all terms are positive, the absolute value is redundant.\n$$\n\\kappa_p = \\frac{0.002 \\ln(2)}{3 \\times 0.23200} = \\frac{0.002 \\ln(2)}{0.696}\n$$\nUsing the value $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147$:\n$$\n\\kappa_p \\approx \\frac{0.002 \\times 0.693147}{0.696} = \\frac{0.001386294}{0.696} \\approx 0.0019918017...\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $0.001992$. In standard scientific notation, this is $1.992 \\times 10^{-3}$.\nThis low value for the condition number indicates that the Richardson extrapolation result $J_R$ is not highly sensitive to small uncertainties in the estimated order of accuracy $p$.",
