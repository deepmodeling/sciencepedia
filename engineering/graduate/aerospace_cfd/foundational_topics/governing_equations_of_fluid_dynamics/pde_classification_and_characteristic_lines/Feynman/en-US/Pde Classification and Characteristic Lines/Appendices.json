This exercise provides foundational practice in classifying a second-order linear PDE with variable coefficients, a scenario frequently encountered in potential flow models.

            "problem": "Consider a two-dimensional, steady, inviscid, small-disturbance potential flow model in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), in which the governing equation for the disturbance potential $u(x,y)$ is represented locally by a second-order linear partial differential equation of the form $a(x,y)\\,u_{xx} + 2\\,b(x,y)\\,u_{xy} + c(x,y)\\,u_{yy} + \\text{lower-order terms} = 0$, where $a(x,y)$, $b(x,y)$, and $c(x,y)$ are smooth coefficient functions that encode local anisotropy and compressibility effects. The classification of the equation (elliptic, parabolic, or hyperbolic) is determined by the sign of the discriminant constructed from the second-order part, and characteristic directions (if they exist) coincide with the null directions of the quadratic form associated with the principal part.\n\nSuppose the coefficient fields are $a(x,y) = 1 + y$, $b(x,y) = x$, and $c(x,y) = 1 - x^{2}$. Starting from the general definition of classification for second-order linear partial differential equations and the geometric meaning of characteristic lines, carry out the following:\n\n1. At the point $(x_{0},y_{0}) = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}, -\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$, determine the type of the equation and the characteristic directions there, by evaluating the appropriate invariants and solving the characteristic-direction condition implied by the principal symbol.\n\n2. Determine the locus in the $(x,y)$-plane on which the equation changes type by setting the discriminant of the principal part to zero and solving explicitly for $y$ as a function of $x$. Provide the final locus in closed form as a single analytic expression $y(x)$.\n\nReport your final answer as the expression $y(x)$ for the type-change locus. No numerical rounding is required, and no physical units are involved in this expression.",
            "solution": "The governing partial differential equation (PDE) is a second-order linear equation of the form:\n$$a(x,y)\\,u_{xx} + 2\\,b(x,y)\\,u_{xy} + c(x,y)\\,u_{yy} + \\text{lower-order terms} = 0$$\nThe classification of such an equation at any point $(x,y)$ depends on the sign of the discriminant of the principal part, $\\Delta(x,y) = b(x,y)^{2} - a(x,y)c(x,y)$.\nThe equation is classified as:\n- Hyperbolic, if $\\Delta > 0$ (two real and distinct characteristic directions exist).\n- Parabolic, if $\\Delta = 0$ (one real characteristic direction exists).\n- Elliptic, if $\\Delta  0$ (no real characteristic directions exist).\n\nThe problem specifies the following coefficient functions:\n$a(x,y) = 1 + y$\n$b(x,y) = x$\n$c(x,y) = 1 - x^{2}$\n\nUsing these, we construct the discriminant function:\n$$\\Delta(x,y) = b(x,y)^{2} - a(x,y)c(x,y) = x^{2} - (1 + y)(1 - x^{2})$$\n\nThe first task is to determine the type of the equation and its characteristic directions at the point $(x_{0},y_{0}) = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}, -\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$.\nFirst, we evaluate the coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$ at this point:\n$a_{0} = a\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, -\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 1 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n$b_{0} = b\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, -\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3}$\n$c_{0} = c\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, -\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{2} = 1 - \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{5}{9}$\n\nNext, we evaluate the discriminant at this point:\n$$\\Delta_{0} = \\Delta\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, -\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = b_{0}^{2} - a_{0}c_{0} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{2} - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{5}{9}\\right) = \\frac{4}{9} - \\frac{5}{18} = \\frac{8}{18} - \\frac{5}{18} = \\frac{3}{18} = \\frac{1}{6}$$\nSince $\\Delta_{0} = \\frac{1}{6} > 0$, the equation is hyperbolic at the point $\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, -\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$.\n\nFor a hyperbolic equation, there are two real characteristic directions. The slopes of the characteristic curves, $m = \\frac{dy}{dx}$, are given by the roots of the quadratic equation:\n$$a\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^{2} - 2b\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right) + c = 0$$\nwhich is $a m^{2} - 2b m + c = 0$. The roots are given by $m = \\frac{2b \\pm \\sqrt{(2b)^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-ac}}{a}$.\nAt the point $(x_{0}, y_{0})$, the equation for the slopes is:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}m^{2} - 2\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)m + \\frac{5}{9} = 0$$\nSolving for $m$:\n$$m = \\frac{b_{0} \\pm \\sqrt{\\Delta_{0}}}{a_{0}} = \\frac{\\frac{2}{3} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{6}}}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2\\left(\\frac{2}{3} \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}\\right) = 2\\left(\\frac{2}{3} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{6}\\right) = \\frac{4}{3} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}$$\nThe two characteristic directions are $m_{1} = \\frac{4 + \\sqrt{6}}{3}$ and $m_{2} = \\frac{4 - \\sqrt{6}}{3}$.\n\nThe second task is to determine the locus in the $(x,y)$-plane where the equation changes type. This occurs where the discriminant is zero, i.e., the equation becomes parabolic. We set the discriminant function $\\Delta(x,y)$ to zero and solve for $y$ as a function of $x$.\n$$\\Delta(x,y) = x^{2} - (1 + y)(1 - x^{2}) = 0$$\nWe solve this equation for $y(x)$:\n$$x^{2} = (1 + y)(1 - x^{2})$$\nTo isolate the term $(1+y)$, we may divide by $(1 - x^2)$. This is permissible provided that $1 - x^{2} \\neq 0$, which means $x \\neq \\pm 1$. If $x = \\pm 1$, the equation becomes $(\\pm 1)^{2} - (1+y)(1-(\\pm 1)^2) = 0$, which simplifies to $1 - (1+y)(0) = 0$, or $1=0$, a contradiction. Thus, the locus does not exist at $x = \\pm 1$.\nProceeding with the division for $x \\neq \\pm 1$:\n$$1 + y = \\frac{x^{2}}{1 - x^{2}}$$\nNow, we solve for $y$:\n$$y = \\frac{x^{2}}{1 - x^{2}} - 1$$\nTo combine into a single rational expression, we find a common denominator:\n$$y = \\frac{x^{2}}{1 - x^{2}} - \\frac{1 - x^{2}}{1 - x^{2}} = \\frac{x^{2} - (1 - x^{2})}{1 - x^{2}}$$\n$$y = \\frac{x^{2} - 1 + x^{2}}{1 - x^{2}}$$\n$$y(x) = \\frac{2x^{2} - 1}{1 - x^{2}}$$\nThis is the expression for the locus of points where the PDE is parabolic, separating the regions of the plane where it is hyperbolic from those where it is elliptic.",

Classification and Characteristic Equations**\nThe equation is a first-order, quasilinear PDE and is therefore classified as hyperbolic.
