            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard exercise in the classification of second-order linear partial differential equations, a fundamental topic in mathematical physics and engineering, including computational fluid dynamics. All necessary data and definitions are provided.\n\nThe governing partial differential equation (PDE) is a second-order linear equation of the form:\n$$a(x,y)\\,u_{xx} + 2\\,b(x,y)\\,u_{xy} + c(x,y)\\,u_{yy} + \\text{lower-order terms} = 0$$\nThe classification of such an equation at any point $(x,y)$ depends on the sign of the discriminant of the principal part, $\\Delta(x,y) = b(x,y)^{2} - a(x,y)c(x,y)$.\nThe equation is classified as:\n- Hyperbolic, if $\\Delta > 0$ (two real and distinct characteristic directions exist).\n- Parabolic, if $\\Delta = 0$ (one real characteristic direction exists).\n- Elliptic, if $\\Delta < 0$ (no real characteristic directions exist).\n\nThe problem specifies the following coefficient functions:\n$a(x,y) = 1 + y$\n$b(x,y) = x$\n$c(x,y) = 1 - x^{2}$\n\nUsing these, we construct the discriminant function:\n$$\\Delta(x,y) = b(x,y)^{2} - a(x,y)c(x,y) = x^{2} - (1 + y)(1 - x^{2})$$\n\nThe first task is to determine the type of the equation and its characteristic directions at the point $(x_{0},y_{0}) = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}, -\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$.\nFirst, we evaluate the coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$ at this point:\n$a_{0} = a\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, -\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 1 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n$b_{0} = b\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, -\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3}$\n$c_{0} = c\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, -\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{2} = 1 - \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{5}{9}$\n\nNext, we evaluate the discriminant at this point:\n$$\\Delta_{0} = \\Delta\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, -\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = b_{0}^{2} - a_{0}c_{0} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{2} - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{5}{9}\\right) = \\frac{4}{9} - \\frac{5}{18} = \\frac{8}{18} - \\frac{5}{18} = \\frac{3}{18} = \\frac{1}{6}$$\nSince $\\Delta_{0} = \\frac{1}{6} > 0$, the equation is hyperbolic at the point $\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, -\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$.\n\nFor a hyperbolic equation, there are two real characteristic directions. The slopes of the characteristic curves, $m = \\frac{dy}{dx}$, are given by the roots of the quadratic equation:\n$$a\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^{2} - 2b\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right) + c = 0$$\nwhich is $a m^{2} - 2b m + c = 0$. Note that the standard characteristic equation is often written as $A(dy)^2 - 2B(dx)(dy) + C(dx)^2 = 0$. With the coefficients from the problem, $A, 2B, C$ are replaced with $a, 2b, c$, so the equation for the characteristic slopes $m=dy/dx$ is indeed $a m^2 - 2b m + c = 0$. The roots are given by $m = \\frac{2b \\pm \\sqrt{(2b)^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-ac}}{a}$.\nAt the point $(x_{0}, y_{0})$, the equation for the slopes is:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}m^{2} - 2\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)m + \\frac{5}{9} = 0$$\nSolving for $m$:\n$$m = \\frac{b_{0} \\pm \\sqrt{\\Delta_{0}}}{a_{0}} = \\frac{\\frac{2}{3} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{6}}}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2\\left(\\frac{2}{3} \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}\\right) = 2\\left(\\frac{2}{3} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{6}\\right) = \\frac{4}{3} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}$$\nThe two characteristic directions are $m_{1} = \\frac{4 + \\sqrt{6}}{3}$ and $m_{2} = \\frac{4 - \\sqrt{6}}{3}$.\n\nThe second task is to determine the locus in the $(x,y)$-plane where the equation changes type. This occurs where the discriminant is zero, i.e., the equation becomes parabolic. We set the discriminant function $\\Delta(x,y)$ to zero and solve for $y$ as a function of $x$.\n$$\\Delta(x,y) = x^{2} - (1 + y)(1 - x^{2}) = 0$$\nWe solve this equation for $y(x)$:\n$$x^{2} = (1 + y)(1 - x^{2})$$\nTo isolate the term $(1+y)$, we may divide by $(1 - x^2)$. This is permissible provided that $1 - x^{2} \\neq 0$, which means $x \\neq \\pm 1$. If $x = \\pm 1$, the equation becomes $(\\pm 1)^{2} - (1+y)(1-(\\pm 1)^2) = 0$, which simplifies to $1 - (1+y)(0) = 0$, or $1=0$, a contradiction. Thus, the locus does not exist at $x = \\pm 1$.\nProceeding with the division for $x \\neq \\pm 1$:\n$$1 + y = \\frac{x^{2}}{1 - x^{2}}$$\nNow, we solve for $y$:\n$$y = \\frac{x^{2}}{1 - x^{2}} - 1$$\nTo combine into a single rational expression, we find a common denominator:\n$$y = \\frac{x^{2}}{1 - x^{2}} - \\frac{1 - x^{2}}{1 - x^{2}} = \\frac{x^{2} - (1 - x^{2})}{1 - x^{2}}$$\n$$y = \\frac{x^{2} - 1 + x^{2}}{1 - x^{2}}$$\n$$y(x) = \\frac{2x^{2} - 1}{1 - x^{2}}$$\nThis is the expression for the locus of points where the PDE is parabolic, separating the regions of the plane where it is hyperbolic from those where it is elliptic.",

We may proceed with the solution.\n\n**Step 2: Derivation of the Stability Restriction**\n\nThe derivation follows the sequence of principles outlined in the problem statement.\n\n**1. PDE Classification and Characteristic Lines**\nThe given partial differential equation is the linear advection equation:\n$$\nu_{t} + a\\,u_{x} = 0\n$$\nTo classify this first-order PDE, we analyze its characteristic curves in the $(x,t)$ plane. A characteristic curve $x(t)$ is a path along which the PDE reduces to an ordinary differential equation (ODE). The total derivative of $u(x(t), t)$ with respect to $t$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\frac{dx}{dt}\n$$\nComparing this to the PDE, rewritten as $u_t = -a u_x$, we see that if we choose the path such that $\\frac{dx}{dt} = a$, the total derivative becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dt} = u_{t} + a u_{x} = 0\n$$\nThis means that the solution $u$ is constant along the characteristic lines defined by $\\frac{dx}{dt} = a$. The solution to this ODE is $x(t) = at + x_0$, where $x_0$ is the position at $t=0$. Because the characteristic speed $a$ is real and finite, the equation is classified as **hyperbolic**. This confirms that information propagates at a finite speed $a$ along these straight characteristic lines.\n\n**2. Integral Conservation Statement**\nThe finite volume method is based on the integral form of the conservation law. We integrate the PDE over a control volume, which is cell $i$ extending from $x_{i-1/2}$ to $x_{i+1/2}$, where $\\Delta x = x_{i+1/2} - x_{i-1/2}$.\n$$\n\\int_{x_{i-1/2}}^{x_{i+1/2}} (u_{t} + a\\,u_{x}) \\, dx = 0\n$$\nUsing the Leibniz integral rule, this becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{x_{i-1/2}}^{x_{i+1/2}} u \\, dx + \\int_{x_{i-1/2}}^{x_{i+1/2}} (a u)_{x} \\, dx = 0\n$$\nDefining the cell-average of $u$ in cell $i$ as $\\bar{u}_i(t) = \\frac{1}{\\Delta x} \\int_{x_{i-1/2}}^{x_{i+1/2}} u(x,t) \\, dx$, and applying the fundamental theorem of calculus to the flux term $F(u)=au$, we get the semi-discrete conservation law:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\bar{u}_i}{dt} \\Delta x + [F(u(x_{i+1/2},t)) - F(u(x_{i-1/2},t))] = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d\\bar{u}_i}{dt} = - \\frac{1}{\\Delta x} [F_{i+1/2} - F_{i-1/2}]\n$$\nwhere $F_{i \\pm 1/2}$ are the fluxes at the cell interfaces.\n\n**3. Numerical Discretization**\nThe problem specifies an explicit forward Euler method for time integration and a first-order upwind Godunov flux for spatial discretization.\nApplying forward Euler to the semi-discrete form gives the fully discrete update formula:\n$$\n\\frac{\\bar{u}_i^{n+1} - \\bar{u}_i^n}{\\Delta t} = - \\frac{1}{\\Delta x} [F_{i+1/2}^n - F_{i-1/2}^n]\n$$\nThe first-order upwind Godunov flux $F_{i+1/2}^n$ is determined by the direction of information propagation (the sign of $a$). For a piecewise-constant data reconstruction (first-order), the state at the interface is the cell-average value from the upwind cell:\n*   If $a > 0$, information propagates from left to right. The flux is $F_{i+1/2}^n = a \\bar{u}_i^n$.\n*   If $a < 0$, information propagates from right to left. The flux is $F_{i+1/2}^n = a \\bar{u}_{i+1}^n$.\n\n**4. Domain of Dependence and the CFL Condition**\nThe Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition is a necessary condition for the stability of explicit numerical methods for hyperbolic PDEs. It states that the numerical domain of dependence of the scheme must contain the physical domain of dependence of the PDE.\n\n*   **Physical Domain of Dependence:** The value of the solution $u$ at any point $(x, t^{n+1})$ is determined by the initial data at time $t^n$ at the point from which the characteristic originates, i.e., $(x - a \\Delta t, t^n)$. Thus, for the cell average $\\bar{u}_i^{n+1}$, which represents the solution in the interval $[x_{i-1/2}, x_{i+1/2}]$ at time $t^{n+1}$, the physical domain of dependence is the interval $[x_{i-1/2} - a\\Delta t, x_{i+1/2} - a\\Delta t]$ at time $t^n$.\n\n*   **Numerical Domain of Dependence:** This is the set of cells at time $t^n$ that are used to compute $\\bar{u}_i^{n+1}$. For the first-order upwind scheme:\n    *   If $a>0$, the update for cell $i$ uses $\\bar{u}_i^n$ and $\\bar{u}_{i-1}^n$. The numerical domain of dependence is the union of cell $i-1$ and cell $i$, which is the interval $[x_{i-1/2} - \\Delta x, x_{i+1/2}]$.\n    *   If $a<0$, the update uses $\\bar{u}_i^n$ and $\\bar{u}_{i+1}^n$. The numerical domain of dependence is the union of cell $i$ and cell $i+1$, which is the interval $[x_{i-1/2}, x_{i+1/2} + \\Delta x]$.\n\n*   **Applying the CFL Condition:**\n    *   Case $1$: $a > 0$. The physical domain must be a subset of the numerical domain:\n    $[x_{i-1/2} - a\\Delta t, x_{i+1/2} - a\\Delta t] \\subseteq [x_{i-1/2} - \\Delta x, x_{i+1/2}]$.\n    This leads to two conditions:\n    $x_{i-1/2} - a\\Delta t \\ge x_{i-1/2} - \\Delta x \\implies a\\Delta t \\le \\Delta x$.\n    $x_{i+1/2} - a\\Delta t \\le x_{i+1/2} \\implies a\\Delta t \\ge 0$.\n    Since $a>0$, the second condition is met. The stability restriction is $a\\Delta t \\le \\Delta x$.\n\n    *   Case $2$: $a < 0$. The physical domain must be a subset of the numerical domain:\n    $[x_{i-1/2} - a\\Delta t, x_{i+1/2} - a\\Delta t] \\subseteq [x_{i-1/2}, x_{i+1/2} + \\Delta x]$.\n    This also leads to two conditions:\n    $x_{i-1/2} - a\\Delta t \\ge x_{i-1/2} \\implies -a\\Delta t \\ge 0$.\n    $x_{i+1/2} - a\\Delta t \\le x_{i+1/2} + \\Delta x \\implies -a\\Delta t \\le \\Delta x$.\n    Since $a<0$, we have $-a = |a|$, so the first condition is met. The stability restriction is $|a|\\Delta t \\le \\Delta x$.\n\nCombining both cases, the quantitative stability restriction is:\n$$\n\\frac{|a|\\Delta t}{\\Delta x} \\le 1\n$$\nThis dimensionless quantity is known as the Courant number, $C$. The stability condition is $C \\le 1$. From this, we derive the restriction on the time step $\\Delta t$:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\le \\frac{\\Delta x}{|a|}\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Evaluation of the Maximum Stable Time Step**\n\nWe now calculate the maximum stable time step, $\\Delta t_{\\text{max}}$, for the given parameters.\nThe stability limit is $\\Delta t_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{\\Delta x}{|a|}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the cell width $\\Delta x$:\n*   Domain length $L = 5\\,\\text{m}$.\n*   Number of cells $N = 200$.\n$$\n\\Delta x = \\frac{L}{N} = \\frac{5\\,\\text{m}}{200} = 0.025\\,\\text{m}\n$$\n\nNext, we use the given transport speed $a$:\n*   Transport speed $a = -320\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.\n*   The magnitude of the speed is $|a| = |-320|\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1} = 320\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.\n\nNow, we calculate the maximum stable time step:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{\\Delta x}{|a|} = \\frac{0.025\\,\\text{m}}{320\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}} = 0.000078125\\,\\text{s}\n$$\n\nFinally, we round the result to four significant figures as requested:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\text{max}} = 7.8125 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{s} \\approx 7.813 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{s}\n$$\nIn decimal form, this is $0.00007813\\,\\text{s}$.",

Classification and Characteristic Equations**\n\nThe equation is a first-order, quasilinear PDE of the form $a(x,t,u)u_t + b(x,t,u)u_x = c(x,t,u)$. Here, $a=1$, $b=u$, and $c=0$. All first-order PDEs are classified as hyperbolic because they possess a single family of real characteristic curves along which information propagates.\n\nThe method of characteristics transforms the PDE into a system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). The characteristic curves in the $x$-$t$ plane are defined by the relation:\n$$\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{b}{a} = u$$\nAlong these curves, the evolution of the solution $u$ is described by the total derivative of $u(x(t), t)$:\n$$\\frac{du}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} \\frac{dt}{dt} + \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\frac{dx}{dt} = u_{t} + u_{x} \\frac{dx}{dt}$$\nSubstituting $\\frac{dx}{dt} = u$, we get:\n$$\\frac{du}{dt} = u_{t} + u\\,u_{x}$$\nFrom the original PDE, we know that $u_{t} + u\\,u_{x} = 0$. Therefore, along the characteristics:\n$$\\frac{du}{dt} = 0$$\nThe characteristic ODEs are thus:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = u \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{du}{dt} = 0 $$\n\n**2. Evolution of the Solution**\n\nWe solve this system of ODEs. Let a characteristic curve start at position $x_0$ at time $t=0$, so $x(0) = x_0$.\nThe second ODE, $\\frac{du}{dt} = 0$, implies that $u$ is constant along each characteristic curve. The value of this constant is determined by the initial condition at the starting point of the characteristic.\n$$u(x(t), t) = u(x(0), 0) = u(x_0, 0) = A \\sin(k x_0)$$\nLet us denote this constant value of $u$ along a specific characteristic as $u_0 = A \\sin(k x_0)$.\n\nNow, we substitute this constant value of $u$ into the first ODE:\n$$\\frac{dx}{dt} = u_0 = A \\sin(k x_0)$$\nThis is a simple ODE for the characteristic path $x(t)$. Integrating with respect to $t$ from $0$ to $t$:\n$$\\int_{x(0)}^{x(t)} dx' = \\int_{0}^{t} (A \\sin(k x_0)) dt'$$\n$$x(t) - x(0) = (A \\sin(k x_0)) t$$\nSince $x(0) = x_0$, we obtain the equation for the characteristic lines, which are straight lines in the $x$-$t$ plane:\n$$x(t) = x_0 + (A \\sin(k x_0)) t$$\nThe solution $u(x,t)$ is given implicitly by this characteristic mapping. For any point $(x,t)$, we find the starting point $x_0$ of the characteristic that passes through it, and the value of the solution is $u(x,t) = u(x_0,0)$. The system of equations defining the solution is:\n$$u(x,t) = A \\sin(k x_0)$$\n$$x = x_0 + (A \\sin(k x_0)) t$$\nThis result shows how the initial sinusoidal wave $u(x,0)$ deforms over time. Each point on the wave profile travels at a constant speed equal to its initial amplitude, leading to a steepening of the wave fronts.\n\n**3.

At this point, the solution gradient $u_x = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$ becomes infinite. We can find this condition by differentiating the implicit solution. We treat $x_0$ as a function of $x$ and $t$.\nWe need to find $u_x = (\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x})_{t}$. We use the chain rule:\n$$u_x = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x_0} \\frac{\\partial x_0}{\\partial x}$$\nFrom $u = A \\sin(k x_0)$, we have:\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x_0} = A k \\cos(k x_0)$$\nFrom $x = x_0 + (A \\sin(k x_0)) t$, we differentiate with respect to $x$ at constant $t$:\n$$1 = \\frac{\\partial x_0}{\\partial x} + t \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_0}(A \\sin(k x_0)) \\frac{\\partial x_0}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial x_0}{\\partial x} (1 + A k t \\cos(k x_0))$$\nSolving for $\\frac{\\partial x_0}{\\partial x}$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial x_0}{\\partial x} = \\frac{1}{1 + A k t \\cos(k x_0)}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $u_x$:\n$$u_x(x,t) = \\frac{A k \\cos(k x_0)}{1 + A k t \\cos(k x_0)}$$\nThe gradient $u_x$ becomes infinite when the denominator is zero:\n$$1 + A k t \\cos(k x_0) = 0$$\nThis gives the time $t$ at which a singularity forms for the characteristic originating at $x_0$:\n$$t = -\\frac{1}{A k \\cos(k x_0)}$$\nWe are looking for the earliest time $t_s > 0$ at which this occurs. This requires $\\cos(k x_0)$ to be negative. To find the minimum positive time, we must maximize the magnitude of the denominator, which means we must find the minimum (most negative) value of $\\cos(k x_0)$. The minimum value of the cosine function is $-1$.\n$$ \\min(t) = t_s \\quad \\text{when} \\quad \\cos(k x_0) = -1 $$\nSubstituting this value, we find the time of the first singularity, often called the breaking time:\n$$t_s = -\\frac{1}{A k (-1)} = \\frac{1}{Ak}$$\n\nTo find the location $x_s$ of this singularity, we first identify the initial position(s) $x_0$ where the gradient blow-up first occurs. The condition $\\cos(k x_0) = -1$ implies that:\n$$k x_0 = (2n+1)\\pi, \\quad \\text{for any integer } n$$\nChoosing the simplest case with $n=0$, we get $k x_0 = \\pi$, or $x_0 = \\frac{\\pi}{k}$. Due to the periodicity of the domain, all such points are equivalent.\n\nThe spatial coordinate $x_s$ of the singularity is the position of this characteristic at time $t_s$. We use the characteristic equation $x_s = x_0 + u(x_0, 0) t_s$.\nFirst, we evaluate $u$ at this specific $x_0$:\n$$u(x_0, 0) = A \\sin(k x_0) = A \\sin(\\pi) = 0$$\nNow we find the location $x_s$:\n$$x_s = \\frac{\\pi}{k} + (0) \\cdot t_s = \\frac{\\pi}{k}$$\nThe singularity first forms at time $t_s = \\frac{1}{Ak}$ at the spatial location $x_s = \\frac{\\pi}{k}$. This physical location corresponds to the point on the initial wave that had zero velocity but the steepest negative velocity gradient. The characteristics on either side of this point converge onto it, causing the gradient to become infinite.\n\nThe coordinates of the first singularity in the $x$-$t$ plane are $(x_s, t_s) = \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{k}, \\frac{1}{Ak}\\right)$.",
