            "problem": "Consider a steady, two-dimensional (2D), incompressible, Newtonian viscous flow in a flat-plate boundary layer relevant to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The flow field is given by a streamwise velocity $u=u(y)$ that depends only on the wall-normal coordinate $y$, with negligible wall-normal velocity $v \\approx 0$. The dynamic viscosity $\\mu$ is constant, and the density $\\rho$ is constant. Using only fundamental continuum assumptions for a Newtonian fluid with the Stokes hypothesis, compute the viscous stress components in the stress tensor for this 2D flow and determine, based on boundary-layer scaling at high Reynolds number $\\mathrm{Re}=\\frac{\\rho U_{\\infty} L}{\\mu}$ for laminar flow over a characteristic length $L$ and free-stream speed $U_{\\infty}$, which viscous stress component is of leading order as $\\mathrm{Re} \\to \\infty$.

For a Newtonian fluid, the viscous stress tensor $\\tau_{ij}$ is linearly related to the rate of strain tensor. The constitutive relation, incorporating the Stokes hypothesis and the given condition of incompressibility ($\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{v} = 0$), simplifies to:\n$$\n\\tau_{ij} = \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial v_i}{\\partial x_j} + \\frac{\\partial v_j}{\\partial x_i} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, $v_i$ are the velocity components, and $x_j$ are the spatial coordinates.\n\nFor a two-dimensional flow in the $(x,y)$ plane, the velocity vector is $\\vec{v} = (u,v)$, and the viscous stress tensor is a $2 \\times 2$ symmetric matrix:\n$$\n\\tau = \\begin{pmatrix} \\tau_{xx} & \\tau_{xy} \\\\ \\tau_{yx} & \\tau_{yy} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe components are given by:\n$$\n\\tau_{xx} = 2\\mu \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_{yy} = 2\\mu \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_{xy} = \\tau_{yx} = \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} \\right)\n$$\n\nThe problem asks to determine the leading-order viscous stress component based on boundary-layer scaling at high Reynolds number $\\mathrm{Re} \\to \\infty$. Let us perform this scaling analysis. Let $L$ be the characteristic length in the streamwise ($x$) direction and $U_{\\infty}$ be the characteristic velocity (the free-stream speed). The boundary layer thickness, $\\delta$, is the characteristic length scale in the wall-normal ($y$) direction. For a laminar boundary layer, scaling analysis shows that $\\delta \\sim L / \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Re}}$.\n\nThe orders of magnitude of the coordinates and velocity components are:\n$x \\sim O(L)$, $y \\sim O(\\delta)$, $u \\sim O(U_{\\infty})$.\nThe wall-normal velocity scale, $V$, can be determined from the continuity equation for incompressible flow, $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = 0$.

Therefore, $\\tau_{xy}$ is the leading-order viscous stress component.\n\nIn the limit $\\mathrm{Re} \\to \\infty$, the normal stresses become negligible compared to the shear stress.

The direction of propagation is determined by the sign of the eigenvalue.\nFor a well-posed initial-boundary-value problem, the number of boundary conditions that must be supplied at a boundary is equal to the number of characteristics entering the computational domain at that boundary.\n\nThe problem specifies a mean flow to the right ($u>0$) and subsonic conditions, meaning the Mach number $M = u/a < 1$. This implies $0 < u < a$. We analyze the sign of each eigenvalue under this condition:\n- $\\lambda_1 = u$: Since $u > 0$, this characteristic propagates to the right.\n- $\\lambda_2 = u-a$: Since $u < a$, $u-a < 0$. This characteristic propagates to the left.\n- $\\lambda_3 = u+a$: Since $u > 0$ and $a > 0$, $u+a > 0$. This characteristic propagates to the right.\n\nWe now classify characteristics as incoming or outgoing at each boundary of the domain $x \\in (0,L)$.\n\nAt the inflow boundary ($x=0$):\n- A characteristic is 'incoming' if information propagates into the domain, i.e., in the positive $x$-direction ($\\lambda > 0$).\n- The incoming characteristics are associated with $\\lambda_1 = u$ and $\\lambda_3 = u+a$.\n- A characteristic is 'outgoing' if information propagates out of the domain, i.e., in the negative $x$-direction ($\\lambda < 0$).\n- The outgoing characteristic is associated with $\\lambda_2 = u-a$.\n- There are two incoming characteristics. Therefore, the number of boundary conditions required at the inflow boundary is $n_{\\text{in}} = 2$. These conditions constrain the physical quantities carried by the incoming waves. The characteristic traveling at speed $u$ is associated with entropy and vorticity (in multiple dimensions); in this 1D adiabatic case, it represents the advection of entropy. The characteristic traveling at $u+a$ is a forward-propagating acoustic (pressure/velocity) wave. Physically, this means two flow quantities must be specified, such as total pressure and total temperature, or density and velocity. The third quantity, typically pressure, is determined by the outgoing acoustic wave information propagating from inside the domain.\n\nAt the outflow boundary ($x=L$):\n- A characteristic is 'incoming' if information propagates into the domain from the outside, i.e., in the negative $x$-direction ($\\lambda < 0$).\n- The incoming characteristic is associated with $\\lambda_2 = u-a$.\n- A characteristic is 'outgoing' if information propagates out of the domain, i.e., in the positive $x$-direction ($\\lambda > 0$).\n- The outgoing characteristics are associated with $\\lambda_1 = u$ and $\\lambda_3 = u+a$.\n- There is one incoming characteristic. Therefore, the number of boundary conditions required at the outflow boundary is $n_{\\text{out}} = 1$. This condition constrains the information carried by the backward-propagating acoustic wave. A physically consistent boundary condition is to specify the static pressure, $p$, at the outflow, which represents the influence of the downstream environment on the flow field. The other two quantities, $\\rho$ and $u$, are determined by the information propagating out of the domain and are typically extrapolated from the interior.\n\nIn summary, for one-dimensional subsonic flow, two boundary conditions are needed at the inflow and one is needed at the outflow. The ordered pair of counts $(n_{\\text{in}}, n_{\\text{out}})$ is therefore $(2, 1)$.",
