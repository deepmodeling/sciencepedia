The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\n**1) Derivation of the General Solution Operator**\n\nThe governing partial differential equation (PDE) is the one-dimensional linear advection equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial t} + U \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial x} = 0\n$$\nWe employ the method of characteristics. The goal is to find curves in the $(x,t)$ plane, called characteristic curves, along which the PDE simplifies. Let a characteristic curve be defined by $x(t)$. The total derivative of $\\phi(x(t), t)$ with respect to time $t$ along this curve is given by the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\phi}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial t} + \\frac{dx}{dt} \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial x}\n$$\nBy comparing this expression with the governing PDE, we can see that if we choose the characteristic curves such that their slope in the $(x,t)$ plane is $\\frac{dx}{dt} = U$, then along these curves, the total derivative of $\\phi$ is zero:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\phi}{dt} = 0\n$$\nWe now have a system of two ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that define the characteristics and the solution along them:\n1. $\\frac{dx}{dt} = U$ (The characteristic equation)\n2. $\\frac{d\\phi}{dt} = 0$ (The equation for $\\phi$ along the characteristics)\n\nWe solve the first ODE by direct integration:\n$$\n\\int dx = \\int U dt \\implies x(t) = Ut + x_0\n$$\nHere, $x_0$ is the constant of integration, which represents the position of the characteristic curve at time $t=0$. This equation describes a family of parallel straight lines in the $(x,t)$ plane, each with a constant slope of $\\frac{1}{U}$.\n\nNext, we solve the second ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\phi}{dt} = 0 \\implies \\phi(x(t), t) = \\text{constant}\n$$\nThis result states that the value of the scalar field $\\phi$ is constant along any given characteristic curve. The value of this constant is determined by the initial condition. At $t=0$, the characteristic curve passes through the point $(x_0, 0)$. The value of $\\phi$ at this point is given by the initial profile:\n$$\n\\phi(x_0, 0) = \\phi_0(x_0)\n$$\nSince $\\phi$ is constant along the characteristic starting at $x_0$, its value at any point $(x,t)$ on this same characteristic must be equal to its initial value:\n$$\n\\phi(x,t) = \\phi_0(x_0)\n$$\nTo obtain the solution in terms of the independent variables $x$ and $t$, we express $x_0$ as a function of $x$ and $t$ using the characteristic equation $x = Ut + x_0$. This gives $x_0 = x - Ut$. Substituting this into our expression for $\\phi(x,t)$, we arrive at the general solution:\n$$\n\\phi(x,t) = \\phi_0(x - Ut)\n$$\nThe solution operator, which maps the initial state $\\phi_0(x)$ to the state at time $t$, $\\phi(x,t)$, is a translation operator. The solution at $(x,t)$ is simply the value of the initial profile at the point $x-Ut$.\n\n**2) Analysis of Profile Deformation**\n\nThe solution derived in part 1 is $\\phi(x,t) = \\phi_0(x - Ut)$. This functional form provides a clear answer regarding shape deformation. A function of the form $f(z)$ has a specific shape defined by the function $f$ itself. A function of the form $f(z - c)$ has the exact same shape as $f(z)$, but it is translated along the $z$-axis by a distance $c$.\n\nIn our case, the argument of the function $\\phi_0$ is $x-Ut$. For any fixed time $t  0$, the quantity $Ut$ is a positive constant. Therefore, the profile of $\\phi(x,t)$ as a function of $x$ is identical to the initial profile $\\phi_0(x)$, simply translated (shifted) in the positive $x$-direction by a distance of $Ut$.\n\nFrom first principles, the governing equation $\\partial_{t}\\phi + U\\,\\partial_{x}\\phi = 0$ states that the substantial derivative of $\\phi$ is zero, $D\\phi/Dt = 0$. This means that an observer moving with the flow at the constant speed $U$ would see no change in the value of $\\phi$. Consequently, the entire scalar field is transported or advected with the flow at speed $U$ without any change in its spatial distribution relative to a frame moving with the flow. This corresponds to a pure translation in the fixed Eulerian frame, with a speed $U$. There are no mechanisms in the governing equation, such as diffusion (e.g., a $\\partial_{xx}\\phi$ term) or a non-uniform velocity field (i.e., $U(x)$), that would cause the shape of the profile to change.\n\nTherefore, the initial profile undergoes **no deformation** in shape as it evolves in time.\n\n**3) Evaluation of the Scalar at $(L, t^{\\star})$**\n\nWe need to compute $\\phi(L, t^{\\star})$ using the derived solution operator and the given values:\n$L = 12.30$, $t^{\\star} = 0.035$, and $U = 210$. The specific units are consistent, so we proceed with the numerical values.\n\nThe solution is $\\phi(x,t) = \\phi_0(x - Ut)$. We evaluate this at $x=L$ and $t=t^{\\star}$:\n$$\n\\phi(L, t^{\\star}) = \\phi_0(L - Ut^{\\star})\n$$\nFirst, we compute the argument of $\\phi_0$:\n$$\nx_{\\text{eval}} = L - Ut^{\\star} = 12.30 - (210)(0.035)\n$$\n$$\nx_{\\text{eval}} = 12.30 - 7.35 = 4.95\n$$\nNow, we must evaluate the initial profile function $\\phi_0(x)$ at $x=4.95$:\n$$\n\\phi_0(4.95) = 0.7\\,\\exp\\!\\Big(-\\frac{(4.95-5.1)^{2}}{2\\cdot 0.8^{2}}\\Big)+0.3\\,\\cos\\!\\Big(2\\pi\\,\\frac{4.95-4.2}{3}\\Big)\\,\\exp\\!\\Big(-\\frac{(4.95-4.2)^{2}}{2\\cdot 1.2^{2}}\\Big)\n$$\nLet's evaluate each of the two terms separately.\n\nFor the second term:\nThe argument of the cosine function is:\n$$\n2\\pi\\,\\frac{4.95-4.2}{3} = 2\\pi\\,\\frac{0.75}{3} = 2\\pi\\,\\frac{3/4}{3} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\n$$\nSince $\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = 0$, the entire second term evaluates to zero:\n$$\n0.3 \\times \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) \\times \\exp(\\dots) = 0.3 \\times 0 \\times \\exp(\\dots) = 0\n$$\n\nFor the first term:\nWe calculate the argument of the exponential function:\n$$\n-\\frac{(4.95-5.1)^{2}}{2\\cdot 0.8^{2}} = -\\frac{(-0.15)^{2}}{2\\cdot 0.64} = -\\frac{0.0225}{1.28} = -0.017578125\n$$\nThe first term is therefore:\n$$\n0.7\\,\\exp(-0.017578125)\n$$\nUsing a calculator, $\\exp(-0.017578125) \\approx 0.98257600$.\nSo the value of the first term is:\n$$\n0.7 \\times 0.98257600 \\approx 0.6878032\n$$\n\nThe total value is the sum of the two terms:\n$$\n\\phi(L, t^{\\star}) = \\phi_0(4.95) \\approx 0.6878032 + 0 = 0.6878032\n$$\nThe problem asks for the result to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $6$, $8$, $7$, $8$. The fifth significant figure is $0$, so we round down.\n$$\n\\phi(L, t^{\\star}) \\approx 0.6878\n$$",

Since $\\mathrm{Pe} \\gg 1$, the argument $\\mathrm{Pe}(\\hat{x}-1)$ is a large negative number, causing $\\hat{\\phi}(\\hat{x})$ to be exponentially close to $0$. This defines the \"outer solution\", $\\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathrm{outer}} \\approx 0$, which corresponds to $\\phi(x) \\approx \\phi_{\\mathrm{in}}$. Physically, high-speed convection transports the inlet concentration $\\phi_{\\mathrm{in}}$ across most of the domain.\n\n- **Inner Region (Boundary Layer)**: The outer solution $\\phi(x) \\approx \\phi_{\\mathrm{in}}$ fails to satisfy the boundary condition at $x=L$, where $\\phi(L) = \\phi_{\\mathrm{out}}$. A thin region, or boundary layer, must exist near $x=L$ where the solution rapidly transitions from $\\phi_{\\mathrm{in}}$ to $\\phi_{\\mathrm{out}}$. Since $U  0$, the flow is from $x=0$ to $x=L$, so the boundary layer forms at the **downstream boundary, $x=L$**.\n\nTo analyze this layer, we introduce a boundary layer coordinate $\\delta_x = L - x$, which is the distance from the downstream wall. In dimensionless terms, $1-\\hat{x} = \\delta_x/L$. The argument of the exponential in our approximate solution becomes $\\mathrm{Pe}(\\hat{x}-1) = -\\mathrm{Pe}(1-\\hat{x}) = -(\\frac{UL}{\\alpha})(\\frac{\\delta_x}{L}) = -\\frac{U \\delta_x}{\\alpha}$. The solution profile within the boundary layer is thus:\n$$\\hat{\\phi} = \\frac{\\phi(x) - \\phi_{\\mathrm{in}}}{\\phi_{\\mathrm{out}} - \\phi_{\\mathrm{in}}} \\approx \\exp\\left(-\\frac{U \\delta_x}{\\alpha}\\right)$$\nThis expression shows that the normalized scalar decays exponentially from $\\hat{\\phi}=1$ at the wall ($\\delta_x=0$) to $\\hat{\\phi} \\approx 0$ outside the layer. The problem defines the boundary layer thickness, $\\delta$, as the characteristic length scale of this transition. For an exponential function of the form $\\exp(-z/\\lambda)$, the characteristic length is $\\lambda$. In our case, the variable is $\\delta_x$ and the argument is $-\\delta_x / (\\alpha/U)$. The characteristic length of this decay is therefore:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{\\alpha}{U}$$\nThis result confirms the scaling obtained by balancing the convective and diffusive terms in the governing ODE. The boundary layer thickness is determined by the local balance of diffusion and convection and is independent of the domain length $L$, provided $L \\gg \\delta$.",

It is a standard, well-posed problem in the analysis of numerical methods for partial differential equations. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to compute the dissipation and dispersion errors for the given numerical scheme and parameters. This is accomplished by first deriving the complex amplification factor $G$.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Amplification Factor ($G$)**\n\nThe von Neumann analysis proceeds by substituting the assumed Fourier mode solution, $\\phi_{j}^{n} = A^{n} \\exp(i j \\theta)$, into the discrete equation. The term $\\phi_{j-1}^{n}$ is expressed as:\n$$ \\phi_{j-1}^{n} = A^{n} \\exp(i (j-1) \\theta) = A^{n} \\exp(i j \\theta) \\exp(-i \\theta) $$\nThe term at the next time step, $\\phi_{j}^{n+1}$, is:\n$$ \\phi_{j}^{n+1} = A^{n+1} \\exp(i j \\theta) $$\nSubstituting these forms into the first-order upwind scheme:\n$$ A^{n+1} \\exp(i j \\theta) = A^{n} \\exp(i j \\theta) - C \\left( A^{n} \\exp(i j \\theta) - A^{n} \\exp(i j \\theta) \\exp(-i \\theta) \\right) $$\nThe amplification factor is defined as $G = A^{n+1} / A^{n}$. Dividing the equation by $A^{n} \\exp(i j \\theta)$, which is non-zero, yields the expression for $G$:\n$$ G = 1 - C \\left( 1 - \\exp(-i \\theta) \\right) $$\nUsing Euler's formula, $\\exp(-i \\theta) = \\cos(\\theta) - i \\sin(\\theta)$, we can write $G$ in Cartesian form:\n$$ G = 1 - C(1 - (\\cos(\\theta) - i \\sin(\\theta))) $$\n$$ G = 1 - C + C\\cos(\\theta) - i C\\sin(\\theta) $$\n$$ G = (1 - C + C\\cos(\\theta)) - i (C\\sin(\\theta)) $$\n\n**2. Calculation of Numerical Parameters**\n\nFirst, we calculate the wave number $k$ and the dimensionless wave number $\\theta$:\n$$ k = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} = \\frac{2\\pi}{0.04 \\ \\text{m}} = 50\\pi \\ \\text{m}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\theta = k \\Delta x = (50\\pi \\ \\text{m}^{-1}) (0.01 \\ \\text{m}) = 0.5\\pi \\ \\text{rad} $$\nWith $\\theta = 0.5\\pi$, we have $\\cos(\\theta) = \\cos(0.5\\pi) = 0$ and $\\sin(\\theta) = \\sin(0.5\\pi) = 1$.\nNow, substitute the values of $C=0.6$ and $\\theta=0.5\\pi$ into the expression for $G$:\n$$ G = (1 - 0.6 + 0.6 \\times 0) - i (0.6 \\times 1) $$\n$$ G = 0.4 - 0.6i $$\n\n**3. Calculation of Dissipation Error ($E_{\\mathrm{diss}}$)**\n\nThe dissipation error is defined as $E_{\\mathrm{diss}} = |G| - 1$. The magnitude of the amplification factor, $|G|$, is:\n$$ |G| = \\sqrt{(\\text{Re}(G))^2 + (\\text{Im}(G))^2} = \\sqrt{(0.4)^2 + (-0.6)^2} = \\sqrt{0.16 + 0.36} = \\sqrt{0.52} $$\nThe dissipation error is therefore:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{diss}} = \\sqrt{0.52} - 1 \\approx 0.721110255 - 1 = -0.278889745 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{diss}} \\approx -0.2789 $$\nA negative dissipation error signifies that the numerical scheme is dissipative, damping the amplitude of the wave.\n\n**4. Calculation of Dispersion Error ($E_{\\mathrm{disp}}$)**\n\nThe dispersion error is defined as $E_{\\mathrm{disp}} = \\psi - \\psi_{\\text{exact}}$, where $\\psi = \\arg(G)$ is the numerical phase and $\\psi_{\\text{exact}} = -ak\\Delta t$ is the exact phase change over one time step.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the numerical phase $\\psi$:\n$$ \\psi = \\arg(G) = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\text{Im}(G)}{\\text{Re}(G)}\\right) = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{-0.6}{0.4}\\right) = \\arctan(-1.5) $$\n$$ \\psi \\approx -0.982793723 \\ \\text{rad} $$\n\nNext, let's calculate the exact phase $\\psi_{\\text{exact}}$. We can simplify the expression $-ak\\Delta t$ using the definition of the CFL number, $C = a\\Delta t / \\Delta x$, which implies $a\\Delta t = C\\Delta x$.\n$$ \\psi_{\\text{exact}} = -ak\\Delta t = -(C\\Delta x)k = -C(k\\Delta x) = -C\\theta $$\nSubstituting the values for $C$ and $\\theta$:\n$$ \\psi_{\\text{exact}} = -0.6 \\times (0.5\\pi) = -0.3\\pi \\ \\text{rad} $$\n$$ \\psi_{\\text{exact}} \\approx -0.942477796 \\ \\text{rad} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the dispersion error:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{disp}} = \\psi - \\psi_{\\text{exact}} = \\arctan(-1.5) - (-0.3\\pi) = \\arctan(-1.5) + 0.3\\pi $$\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{disp}} \\approx -0.982793723 - (-0.942477796) = -0.040315927 \\ \\text{rad} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{disp}} \\approx -0.04032 \\ \\text{rad} $$\nThe non-zero dispersion error indicates that the numerical wave speed differs from the exact wave speed, causing phase errors that accumulate over time. A negative dispersion error means the numerical wave lags behind the exact wave.\n\nThe final result is the ordered pair $(E_{\\mathrm{diss}}, E_{\\mathrm{disp}})$.",
