The derivation and solution are presented below.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Linearized Expression for Interfacial Pressure $\\,p^{\\*}$.**\n\nThe one-dimensional, inviscid, compressible flow is governed by the Euler equations. For the analysis of wave propagation, it is convenient to consider the characteristic form of these equations. For simple isentropic waves, the changes in pressure $dp$ and velocity $du$ are related along the paths of acoustic disturbances (the characteristics), which propagate at speeds $u \\pm c$ relative to a fixed observer. The relationship is given by the compatibility equations:\n$$ dp \\pm \\rho c \\, du = 0 $$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density, $c$ is the speed of sound given by $c^2 = (\\partial p / \\partial \\rho)_s$ for an isentropic process, and $u$ is the fluid velocity. The '$+$' sign corresponds to a left-traveling wave (in the sense of information propagation relative to the fluid, along characteristic $dx/dt = u-c$), and the '$-$' sign corresponds to a right-traveling wave (along characteristic $dx/dt = u+c$).\n\nThe solution to a Riemann problem involves a left-traveling wave, a right-traveling wave, and a contact discontinuity separating them. The state between the two waves is known as the \"star\" region. Across the contact discontinuity, pressure and velocity are continuous. Let these values be $p^*$ and $u^*$.\n\nThe left-traveling wave separates the initial left state $(\\rho_L, u_L, p_L)$ from the left star state $(\\rho_L^*, u^*, p^*)$. The right-traveling wave separates the initial right state $(\\rho_R, u_R, p_R)$ from the right star state $(\\rho_R^*, u^*, p^*)$.\n\nWe assume a linearized acoustic model, which is valid for weak waves where the changes in state variables are small. This allows us to integrate the differential characteristic relations by treating the acoustic impedance, $A = \\rho c$, as a constant across each wave ($A_L = \\rho_L c_L$ for the left wave and $A_R = \\rho_R c_R$ for the right wave).\n\n1.  **Relation across the left-traveling wave:**\n    This wave connects state $L$ to the star region. For a wave traveling to the left, an increase in pressure corresponds to a decrease in velocity. The integrated characteristic relation is:\n    $$ \\Delta p \\approx -A_L \\Delta u $$\n    $$ p^* - p_L = -A_L (u^* - u_L) $$\n    Solving for $u^*$, we obtain the locus of states accessible from state $L$:\n    $$ u^* = u_L - \\frac{p^* - p_L}{A_L} $$\n\n2.  **Relation across the right-traveling wave:**\n    This wave connects state $R$ to the star region. For a wave traveling to the right, an increase in pressure corresponds to an increase in velocity. The integrated characteristic relation is:\n    $$ \\Delta p \\approx A_R \\Delta u $$\n    $$ p^* - p_R = A_R (u^* - u_R) $$\n    Solving for $u^*$, we obtain the locus of states accessible from state $R$:\n    $$ u^* = u_R + \\frac{p^* - p_R}{A_R} $$\n\n3.  **Solving for the interfacial pressure $\\,p^{\\*}$:**\n    The interfacial velocity $u^*$ must be the same in both expressions.

Then\n$$\nr_\\pm\\cdot\\nabla\\lambda_\\pm = \\begin{pmatrix}\\rho\\\\ \\pm c\\end{pmatrix}\\cdot\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix} = \\pm c\\neq 0,\n$$\nso both characteristic fields are genuinely nonlinear. Consequently, each family admits both rarefactions and shocks depending on the left/right states, and there is no linearly degenerate family generating a contact wave. Therefore, the isothermal Riemann solution consists of exactly $2$ elementary waves (each either a shock or a centered rarefaction) separated by a single constant intermediate state.\n\nRarefaction integral curves and Riemann invariants. For genuinely nonlinear fields, the centered rarefactions follow integral curves determined by Riemann invariants. A standard calculation for isentropic/isothermal Euler yields the invariants\n$$\nw_\\pm = u \\pm \\int \\frac{c^2}{\\rho}\\,\\frac{d\\rho}{c} = u \\pm c\\,\\ln\\rho,\n$$\nso centered rarefactions in the $\\pm$ family satisfy $u\\pm c\\ln\\rho=\\text{const}$.\n\nShock curves and admissibility. The Rankine–Hugoniot jump conditions across a discontinuity moving at speed $s$ are\n$$\ns\\,[\\rho]=[\\rho u],\\qquad s\\,[\\rho u]=[\\rho u^2 + c^2\\rho],\n$$\nwhere $[\\,\\cdot\\,]$ denotes the jump from left to right states. In the shock-attached frame, letting $w=u-s$, the jump conditions become\n$$\n\\rho_L w_L = \\rho_R w_R,\\qquad \\rho_L w_L^2 + c^2\\rho_L = \\rho_R w_R^2 + c^2\\rho_R.\n$$\nEliminating $w_R$ gives\n$$\nw_L^2\\,\\frac{\\rho_L}{\\rho_R} = c^2,\\qquad w_R^2\\,\\frac{\\rho_R}{\\rho_L} = c^2,\n$$\nso the shock relations are consistent and compressive shocks satisfy Lax admissibility $\\lambda_i(U_R)<s<\\lambda_i(U_L)$ for the $i$th family.\n\nEntropy and admissibility without an energy equation. In the adiabatic Euler system, the energy equation couples to the second law of thermodynamics so that the physical thermodynamic entropy $s$ is transported and increases across shocks; admissibility can be enforced by the entropy inequality $s_t+u\\,s_x\\ge 0$ or, in weak form, by a convex entropy pair associated with the thermodynamics. In the isothermal system, physical entropy is not dynamically carried because the energy equation is absent; instead, admissibility must be enforced by a mathematical entropy pair $(\\eta,q)$ satisfying the compatibility relations with the flux. A canonical convex entropy for the isentropic/isothermal class is\n$$\n\\eta(\\rho,u)=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\rho u^2 + \\Pi(\\rho),\\qquad \\Pi''(\\rho)=\\frac{p'(\\rho)}{\\rho}=\\frac{c^2}{\\rho},\n$$\nwhich integrates to\n$$\n\\Pi'(\\rho)=c^2\\ln\\rho + C,\\qquad \\Pi(\\rho)=c^2\\rho\\ln\\rho - c^2\\rho + C\\rho,\n$$\nso one may take\n$$\n\\eta(\\rho,u)=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\rho u^2 + c^2\\rho\\ln\\rho - c^2\\rho,\n$$\nwith associated entropy flux $q(\\rho,u)=u\\big(\\eta(\\rho,u)+p(\\rho)\\big)$ for this class. The admissibility condition is the entropy inequality $\\eta_t+q_x\\le 0$ in the distributional sense, which selects compressive shocks consistent with Lax conditions and rules out nonphysical expansion shocks.\n\nComparison to the adiabatic case. The adiabatic Euler Riemann problem has $3$ waves: two acoustic waves (genuinely nonlinear) with speeds $u\\pm a$ where $a=\\sqrt{\\gamma p/\\rho}$ varies with the state, and a linearly degenerate contact discontinuity with speed $u$. The presence of the energy equation provides a physical entropy variable whose increase across shocks is a hallmark of admissibility. In contrast, the isothermal system has only $2$ waves (no contact, because there is no independent energy/entropy field), constant sound speed $c$ so characteristic speeds are $u\\pm c$, rarefactions satisfy $u\\pm c\\ln\\rho=\\text{const}$, and admissibility is enforced by a convex mathematical entropy inequality rather than by the transport of physical thermodynamic entropy.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n- Option A. This states strict hyperbolicity with characteristic speeds $u\\pm c$, genuine nonlinearity and the correct rarefaction invariants $u\\pm c\\ln\\rho=\\text{const}$, the absence of a contact wave (hence exactly $2$ waves), and the use of a convex mathematical entropy (e.g., $\\eta(\\rho,u)=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\rho u^2 + c^2\\rho\\ln\\rho - c^2\\rho$) to enforce shock admissibility. It correctly contrasts with the adiabatic case having $3$ waves and a physical entropy from the energy equation. Verdict: Correct.\n\n- Option B. Claims the isothermal system is not hyperbolic because $c$ is constant. This is false; the eigenvalues $u\\pm c$ are distinct and the system is strictly hyperbolic. It also asserts a contact discontinuity and a $3$-wave pattern, which do not occur in the isothermal $(\\rho,u)$ system. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\n- Option C. Claims shocks are inadmissible due to the absence of the energy equation and that solutions must be pairs of rarefactions. This ignores mathematical entropy pairs and Lax admissibility for compressive shocks, which are valid for isothermal Euler. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\n- Option D. Claims identity with the adiabatic $3$-wave pattern, uses acoustic speeds $u\\pm\\sqrt{\\gamma p/\\rho}$ inappropriate for isothermal closure (where the speeds are $u\\pm c$), and asserts entropy is constant across shocks, which is not an admissibility principle; in the adiabatic case physical entropy increases across shocks, and in the isothermal case a mathematical entropy inequality is used. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\n- Option E. Asserts linear degeneracy ($r_i\\cdot\\nabla\\lambda_i=0$) of the isothermal fields, which is false since $r_\\pm\\cdot\\nabla\\lambda_\\pm=\\pm c\\neq 0$. It also incorrectly concludes all waves are contacts and that the intermediate state is non-unique. Verdict: Incorrect.",
