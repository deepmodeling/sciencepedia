            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, providing all necessary information for a unique solution without any internal contradictions or reliance on unsound principles.\n\nThe task is to derive expressions for the temperatures on the left ($T_L$) and right ($T_R$) of a contact discontinuity, as well as the change in specific entropy ($\\Delta s = s_R - s_L$) across it. We are given the constant pressure $p$ and the densities on both sides, $\\rho_L$ and $\\rho_R$. The gas is assumed to be calorically perfect with a given ratio of specific heats $\\gamma$ and specific gas constant $R$.\n\nFirst, we derive the expressions for the temperatures. The problem provides the ideal gas equation of state:\n$$p = \\rho R T$$\nwhere $p$ is the pressure, $\\rho$ is the density, $R$ is the specific gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. This relation holds on both sides of the contact discontinuity. We can solve for temperature $T$:\n$$T = \\frac{p}{\\rho R}$$\nApplying this to the left (State $L$) and right (State $R$) sides of the discontinuity, and noting that pressure $p$ is continuous across the interface ($p_L = p_R = p$), we obtain the expressions for $T_L$ and $T_R$:\n$$T_L = \\frac{p}{\\rho_L R}$$\n$$T_R = \\frac{p}{\\rho_R R}$$\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the specific entropy difference, $\\Delta s = s_R - s_L$. The problem states we should start from the Gibbs relation in the form $T\\,\\mathrm{d}s = \\mathrm{d}u + p\\,\\mathrm{d}v$. A more convenient form for this problem, where pressure is constant, is the second Gibbs relation (or T-ds relation), which can be derived from the first.\nThe specific enthalpy is defined as $h = u + pv$, where $v = 1/\\rho$ is the specific volume. The differential is $\\mathrm{d}h = \\mathrm{d}u + p\\,\\mathrm{d}v + v\\,\\mathrm{d}p$.\nSubstituting $\\mathrm{d}u + p\\,\\mathrm{d}v$ from the first Gibbs relation gives $\\mathrm{d}h = T\\,\\mathrm{d}s + v\\,\\mathrm{d}p$.\nRearranging for $\\mathrm{d}s$:\n$$T\\,\\mathrm{d}s = \\mathrm{d}h - v\\,\\mathrm{d}p$$\nDividing by $T$:\n$$\\mathrm{d}s = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}h}{T} - \\frac{v}{T}\\,\\mathrm{d}p$$\nFor a calorically perfect gas, the change in specific enthalpy is $\\mathrm{d}h = C_p\\,\\mathrm{d}T$, where $C_p$ is the constant specific heat at constant pressure. From the ideal gas law $p = \\rho R T$, we have $v/T = (1/\\rho)/T = 1/(\\rho T) = R/p$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\mathrm{d}s$:\n$$\\mathrm{d}s = C_p \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{T} - R \\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{p}$$\nTo find the total change in entropy from State $L$ to State $R$, we integrate this expression:\n$$\\Delta s = s_R - s_L = \\int_{L}^{R} \\mathrm{d}s = \\int_{T_L}^{T_R} C_p \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{T} - \\int_{p_L}^{p_R} R \\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{p}$$\nSince $C_p$ and $R$ are constants, the integration yields:\n$$\\Delta s = C_p \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_R}{T_L}\\right) - R \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_R}{p_L}\\right)$$\nAcross a contact discontinuity, pressure is continuous, so $p_L = p_R = p$. This means $\\frac{p_R}{p_L} = 1$, and the second term vanishes because $\\ln(1) = 0$.\n$$\\Delta s = C_p \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_R}{T_L}\\right)$$\nWe can express the temperature ratio in terms of the given densities. Using the temperature expressions derived earlier:\n$$\\frac{T_R}{T_L} = \\frac{p/(\\rho_R R)}{p/(\\rho_L R)} = \\frac{\\rho_L}{\\rho_R}$$\nSubstituting this into the entropy equation:\n$$\\Delta s = C_p \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\rho_L}{\\rho_R}\\right) = -C_p \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\rho_R}{\\rho_L}\\right)$$\nThe final step is to express $C_p$ in terms of the given constants $\\gamma$ and $R$. The ratio of specific heats is $\\gamma = C_p/C_v$, and Mayer's relation is $C_p - C_v = R$. From the first relation, $C_v = C_p/\\gamma$. Substituting this into the second:\n$$C_p\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma}\\right) = R \\implies C_p\\left(\\frac{\\gamma - 1}{\\gamma}\\right) = R \\implies C_p = \\frac{\\gamma R}{\\gamma - 1}$$\nSubstituting this into our expression for $\\Delta s$:\n$$\\Delta s = -\\frac{\\gamma R}{\\gamma - 1} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\rho_R}{\\rho_L}\\right)$$\nNow we evaluate these expressions numerically with the provided data:\n$p = 1.80 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$\n$\\rho_L = 1.50\\ \\mathrm{kg}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n$\\rho_R = 2.40\\ \\mathrm{kg}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n$\\gamma = 1.4$\n$R = 287\\ \\mathrm{J}\\ \\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n\nCalculation of $T_L$:\n$$T_L = \\frac{1.80 \\times 10^5}{1.50 \\times 287} = \\frac{180000}{430.5} \\approx 418.118466... \\ \\mathrm{K}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $T_L = 418.1\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n\nCalculation of $T_R$:\n$$T_R = \\frac{1.80 \\times 10^5}{2.40 \\times 287} = \\frac{180000}{688.8} \\approx 261.324041... \\ \\mathrm{K}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $T_R = 261.3\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n\nCalculation of $\\Delta s$:\nFirst, we calculate the density ratio:\n$$\\frac{\\rho_R}{\\rho_L} = \\frac{2.40}{1.50} = 1.6$$\nNext, we calculate $C_p$:\n$$C_p = \\frac{1.4 \\times 287}{1.4 - 1} = \\frac{401.8}{0.4} = 1004.5\\ \\mathrm{J}\\ \\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$$\nNow we compute $\\Delta s$:\n$$\\Delta s = -1004.5 \\times \\ln(1.6) \\approx -1004.5 \\times 0.4700036... \\approx -472.1386... \\ \\mathrm{J}\\ \\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\Delta s = -472.1\\ \\mathrm{J}\\ \\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.\n\nThe final requested values are $T_L = 418.1\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $T_R = 261.3\\ \\mathrm{K}$, and $\\Delta s = -472.1\\ \\mathrm{J}\\ \\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.",

Substituting this into the definition of specific total energy, $E = e + \\frac{1}{2}u^2$, we get:\n$$E = \\frac{p}{(\\gamma - 1)\\rho} + \\frac{1}{2}u^2$$\nUsing this relationship, we find the specific total energies for the left and right cell-averaged states, subject to the given contact conditions $u_{L} = u_{R} = u_{0}$ and $p_{L} = p_{R} = p_{0}$:\n$$E_{L} = \\frac{p_{L}}{(\\gamma - 1)\\rho_{L}} + \\frac{1}{2}u_{L}^{2} = \\frac{p_{0}}{(\\gamma - 1)\\rho_{L}} + \\frac{1}{2}u_{0}^{2}$$\n$$E_{R} = \\frac{p_{R}}{(\\gamma - 1)\\rho_{R}} + \\frac{1}{2}u_{R}^{2} = \\frac{p_{0}}{(\\gamma - 1)\\rho_{R}} + \\frac{1}{2}u_{0}^{2}$$\nNext, we determine the reconstructed values at the cell face. The density $\\rho_{f}$ is given as:\n$$\\rho_{f} = \\alpha \\rho_{L} + (1 - \\alpha) \\rho_{R}$$\nThe face velocity $u_{f}$ is:\n$$u_{f} = \\alpha u_{L} + (1 - \\alpha) u_{R} = \\alpha u_{0} + (1 - \\alpha) u_{0} = u_{0}$$\nThe face specific total energy $E_{f}$ is obtained by interpolating $E_{L}$ and $E_{R}$:\n$$E_{f} = \\alpha E_{L} + (1 - \\alpha) E_{R}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $E_{L}$ and $E_{R}$:\n$$E_{f} = \\alpha \\left( \\frac{p_{0}}{(\\gamma - 1)\\rho_{L}} + \\frac{1}{2}u_{0}^{2} \\right) + (1 - \\alpha) \\left( \\frac{p_{0}}{(\\gamma - 1)\\rho_{R}} + \\frac{1}{2}u_{0}^{2} \\right)$$\n$$E_{f} = \\frac{p_{0}}{\\gamma - 1} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha}{\\rho_{L}} + \\frac{1 - \\alpha}{\\rho_{R}} \\right) + \\left( \\alpha + 1 - \\alpha \\right) \\frac{1}{2}u_{0}^{2}$$\n$$E_{f} = \\frac{p_{0}}{\\gamma - 1} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha}{\\rho_{L}} + \\frac{1 - \\alpha}{\\rho_{R}} \\right) + \\frac{1}{2}u_{0}^{2}$$\nNow, we recover the face pressure $p_{f}$ from these reconstructed quantities using the formula $p_f = (\\gamma - 1)\\rho_f (E_f - \\frac{1}{2}u_f^2)$. We have $u_f = u_0$, so the specific kinetic energy term is $\\frac{1}{2}u_0^2$. The specific internal energy at the face is:\n$$e_{f} = E_{f} - \\frac{1}{2}u_{f}^{2} = E_{f} - \\frac{1}{2}u_{0}^{2} = \\frac{p_{0}}{\\gamma - 1} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha}{\\rho_{L}} + \\frac{1 - \\alpha}{\\rho_{R}} \\right)$$\nThe recovered face pressure $p_{f}$ is then:\n$$p_{f} = (\\gamma - 1)\\rho_{f} e_{f} = (\\gamma - 1) (\\alpha \\rho_{L} + (1 - \\alpha) \\rho_{R}) \\left[ \\frac{p_{0}}{\\gamma - 1} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha}{\\rho_{L}} + \\frac{1 - \\alpha}{\\rho_{R}} \\right) \\right]$$\nThe factor of $(\\gamma - 1)$ cancels, yielding the simplified closed-form expression for $p_{f}$:\n$$p_{f} = p_{0} \\left( \\alpha \\rho_{L} + (1 - \\alpha) \\rho_{R} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\alpha}{\\rho_{L}} + \\frac{1 - \\alpha}{\\rho_{R}} \\right)$$\nTo show that $p_{f}$ generally differs from $p_{0}$, consider the term multiplying $p_{0}$. Let $x = \\rho_{L}$ and $y = \\rho_{R}$. For positive $x, y$ and weights $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in Sedrakyan's form states that $(\\alpha x + (1-\\alpha)y)(\\frac{\\alpha}{x} + \\frac{1-\\alpha}{y}) \\ge 1$. Equality holds if and only if $x=y$. Since the problem states $\\rho_{L} \\neq \\rho_{R}$, the inequality is strict:\n$$\\left( \\alpha \\rho_{L} + (1 - \\alpha) \\rho_{R} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\alpha}{\\rho_{L}} + \\frac{1 - \\alpha}{\\rho_{R}} \\right) > 1$$\nTherefore, $p_{f} > p_{0}$ whenever $\\rho_{L} \\neq \\rho_{R}$. This demonstrates that linearly interpolating the specific total energy generates a spurious pressure increase at the contact discontinuity, violating the physical invariant $p = constant$.\n\n**Part 2: Pressure-Based Correction**\n\nThe source of the error is the non-linear relationship between pressure and the interpolated quantities. To eliminate the spurious pressure, we must enforce the pressure-constancy condition at the face. We propose a correction where we define a new face specific total energy, $E_{f}^{\\mathrm{corr}}$, such that recovering the pressure from the set $(\\rho_f, u_f, E_f^{\\mathrm{corr}})$ yields exactly $p_0$.\n\nThe desired condition is:\n$$p_{0} = (\\gamma - 1) \\rho_{f} \\left( E_{f}^{\\mathrm{corr}} - \\frac{1}{2} u_{f}^{2} \\right)$$\nWe use the previously calculated values for $\\rho_{f}$ and $u_{f} = u_{0}$:\n$$p_{0} = (\\gamma - 1) (\\alpha \\rho_{L} + (1 - \\alpha) \\rho_{R}) \\left( E_{f}^{\\mathrm{corr}} - \\frac{1}{2} u_{0}^{2} \\right)$$\nWe can now algebraically solve for $E_{f}^{\\mathrm{corr}}$:\n$$E_{f}^{\\mathrm{corr}} - \\frac{1}{2} u_{0}^{2} = \\frac{p_{0}}{(\\gamma - 1) (\\alpha \\rho_{L} + (1 - \\alpha) \\rho_{R})}$$\nThis gives the explicit expression for the corrected face specific total energy:\n$$E_{f}^{\\mathrm{corr}} = \\frac{p_{0}}{(\\gamma - 1) (\\alpha \\rho_{L} + (1 - \\alpha) \\rho_{R})} + \\frac{1}{2} u_{0}^{2}$$\nBy using this $E_{f}^{\\mathrm{corr}}$ instead of the directly interpolated $E_{f}$, a numerical scheme can reconstruct the face state in a way that correctly preserves the constant pressure across the stationary contact discontinuity, thus avoiding the generation of spurious oscillations. This is conceptually equivalent to interpolating primitive variables like $(\\rho, u, p)$ and then reconstructing the conservative variables if needed.",
