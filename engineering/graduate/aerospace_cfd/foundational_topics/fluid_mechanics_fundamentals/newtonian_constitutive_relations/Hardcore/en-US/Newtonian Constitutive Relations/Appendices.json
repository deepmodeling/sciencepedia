            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the component form of the viscous stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$, for a compressible Newtonian fluid in three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates, starting from fundamental principles.\n\n**Step 1: Problem Validation**\n\nThe problem statement has been validated and is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. It is a standard derivation in continuum fluid dynamics. All necessary assumptions are provided:\n1.  The fluid is a three-dimensional compressible Newtonian gas.\n2.  The coordinate system is orthonormal Cartesian $(x,y,z)$ with velocity components $(u,v,w)$.\n3.  The viscous stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ is defined as $\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} + p\\mathbf{I}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is the Cauchy stress tensor and $p$ is the thermodynamic pressure.\n4.  The mapping from the local velocity gradient, $\\nabla \\mathbf{v}$, to $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ is linear, frame-indifferent, and isotropic.\n5.  The dynamic viscosity, $\\mu$, is constant.\n6.  Stokes’ hypothesis for a simple gas applies.\n\nThe problem is valid and a solution will be derived.\n\n**Step 2: Derivation from First Principles**\n\nThe derivation proceeds by systematically applying the given assumptions.\n\n**1. Linearity and Frame Indifference**\nThe most general linear relationship between the viscous stress tensor $\\tau_{ij}$ and the velocity gradient tensor $L_{kl} = \\frac{\\partial v_k}{\\partial x_l}$ would be $\\tau_{ij} = C_{ijkl} L_{kl}$, where $\\mathbf{C}$ is a fourth-order tensor of material properties.\n\nThe principle of frame indifference (or material objectivity) requires that the constitutive law be independent of rigid body motions of the reference frame. The velocity gradient tensor $\\mathbf{L}$ can be decomposed into a symmetric part, the rate-of-strain tensor $\\mathbf{D}$, and an anti-symmetric part, the rate-of-rotation (or vorticity) tensor $\\mathbf{W}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{L} = \\mathbf{D} + \\mathbf{W} $$\nwhere\n$$ D_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial v_i}{\\partial x_j} + \\frac{\\partial v_j}{\\partial x_i} \\right) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad W_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial v_i}{\\partial x_j} - \\frac{\\partial v_j}{\\partial x_i} \\right) $$\nThe rate-of-rotation tensor $\\mathbf{W}$ represents local rigid body rotation, which should not induce stress in a simple fluid. Therefore, the viscous stress must depend only on the rate-of-strain tensor $\\mathbf{D}$. The linear relationship thus simplifies to a mapping from $\\mathbf{D}$ to $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$:\n$$ \\tau_{ij} = K_{ijkl} D_{kl} $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{K}$ is another fourth-order tensor.\n\n**2. Isotropy**\nThe fluid is assumed to be isotropic, meaning its material properties are independent of direction. This imposes constraints on the tensor $\\mathbf{K}$. For an isotropic material, the most general fourth-order tensor that maps a symmetric second-order tensor ($\\mathbf{D}$) to another symmetric second-order tensor ($\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$) has the form:\n$$ K_{ijkl} = \\lambda \\delta_{ij} \\delta_{kl} + \\mu (\\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl} + \\delta_{il}\\delta_{jk}) $$\nwhere $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$ are scalar material constants, and $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. Substituting this into the stress-strain relation gives:\n$$ \\tau_{ij} = \\lambda \\delta_{ij} \\delta_{kl} D_{kl} + \\mu (\\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl} + \\delta_{il}\\delta_{jk}) D_{kl} $$\nUsing the properties of the Kronecker delta, $\\delta_{kl}D_{kl} = D_{kk} = \\text{tr}(\\mathbf{D})$, and $(\\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl} + \\delta_{il}\\delta_{jk})D_{kl} = D_{ij} + D_{ji}$. Since $\\mathbf{D}$ is symmetric ($D_{ij} = D_{ji}$), this term becomes $2D_{ij}$. The relation thus simplifies to:\n$$ \\tau_{ij} = \\lambda (\\text{tr}(\\mathbf{D})) \\delta_{ij} + 2\\mu D_{ij} $$\nHere, $\\mu$ is identified as the dynamic (or shear) viscosity, and $\\lambda$ is the second coefficient of viscosity. The term $\\text{tr}(\\mathbf{D}) = D_{kk} = \\frac{\\partial v_k}{\\partial x_k} = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}$ represents the rate of volumetric dilatation.\n\n**3. Stokes' Hypothesis**\nThis hypothesis provides a relationship between the two viscosity coefficients, $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$. It arises from considering the mechanical pressure, $p_m$, which is the negative of the mean normal stress: $p_m = -\\frac{1}{3}\\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})$. The Cauchy stress tensor is $\\sigma_{ij} = -p\\delta_{ij} + \\tau_{ij}$.\nSubstituting the expression for $\\tau_{ij}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{ij} = -p\\delta_{ij} + \\lambda (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) \\delta_{ij} + 2\\mu D_{ij} $$\nThe trace of the Cauchy stress tensor is:\n$$ \\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = \\sigma_{kk} = \\sum_{k=1}^{3} \\left( -p\\delta_{kk} + \\lambda (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) \\delta_{kk} + 2\\mu D_{kk} \\right) $$\n$$ \\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = -3p + 3\\lambda (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) + 2\\mu (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) = -3p + (3\\lambda + 2\\mu)(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) $$\nThe mean normal stress is $\\frac{1}{3}\\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = -p + \\left(\\lambda + \\frac{2}{3}\\mu\\right)(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v})$. The quantity $\\zeta = \\lambda + \\frac{2}{3}\\mu$ is the bulk viscosity, which relates the difference between mechanical and thermodynamic pressure to the rate of expansion. Stokes' hypothesis posits that for a simple monatomic gas (and it is often applied more generally), the bulk viscosity $\\zeta$ is zero.\n$$ \\zeta = \\lambda + \\frac{2}{3}\\mu = 0 \\implies \\lambda = -\\frac{2}{3}\\mu $$\nSubstituting this result back into the constitutive relation for $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$:\n$$ \\tau_{ij} = -\\frac{2}{3}\\mu (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) \\delta_{ij} + 2\\mu D_{ij} $$\nThis is the constitutive relation for a compressible Newtonian fluid satisfying Stokes' hypothesis.\n\n**4. Component Form in Cartesian Coordinates**\nWe now write out the components of this tensor equation using the velocity field $\\mathbf{v} = (u,v,w)$ and coordinates $(x,y,z)$. The shorthand notation $u_x = \\partial u/\\partial x$, etc., is used.\nThe divergence of velocity is:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} = u_x + v_y + w_z $$\nThe components of the rate-of-strain tensor $\\mathbf{D}$ are:\n$$ D_{xx} = u_x, \\quad D_{yy} = v_y, \\quad D_{zz} = w_z $$\n$$ D_{xy} = \\frac{1}{2}(u_y + v_x), \\quad D_{xz} = \\frac{1}{2}(u_z + w_x), \\quad D_{yz} = \\frac{1}{2}(v_z + w_y) $$\n\nThe components of $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ are derived as follows:\n\n**Normal Stresses ($\\delta_{ij} = 1$):**\n- For $\\tau_{xx}$ ($i=j=1$):\n  $$ \\tau_{xx} = 2\\mu D_{xx} - \\frac{2}{3}\\mu (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) \\delta_{11} = 2\\mu u_x - \\frac{2}{3}\\mu (u_x + v_y + w_z) $$\n- For $\\tau_{yy}$ ($i=j=2$):\n  $$ \\tau_{yy} = 2\\mu D_{yy} - \\frac{2}{3}\\mu (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) \\delta_{22} = 2\\mu v_y - \\frac{2}{3}\\mu (u_x + v_y + w_z) $$\n- For $\\tau_{zz}$ ($i=j=3$):\n  $$ \\tau_{zz} = 2\\mu D_{zz} - \\frac{2}{3}\\mu (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) \\delta_{33} = 2\\mu w_z - \\frac{2}{3}\\mu (u_x + v_y + w_z) $$\n\n**Shear Stresses ($\\delta_{ij} = 0$ for $i \\neq j$):**\n- For $\\tau_{xy}$ ($i=1, j=2$):\n  $$ \\tau_{xy} = 2\\mu D_{xy} - \\frac{2}{3}\\mu (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) \\delta_{12} = 2\\mu \\left( \\frac{1}{2}(u_y + v_x) \\right) = \\mu(u_y + v_x) $$\n- For $\\tau_{xz}$ ($i=1, j=3$):\n  $$ \\tau_{xz} = 2\\mu D_{xz} - \\frac{2}{3}\\mu (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) \\delta_{13} = 2\\mu \\left( \\frac{1}{2}(u_z + w_x) \\right) = \\mu(u_z + w_x) $$\n- For $\\tau_{yz}$ ($i=2, j=3$):\n  $$ \\tau_{yz} = 2\\mu D_{yz} - \\frac{2}{3}\\mu (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) \\delta_{23} = 2\\mu \\left( \\frac{1}{2}(v_z + w_y) \\right) = \\mu(v_z + w_y) $$\n\nThese six components are assembled into a single row matrix as requested.",

The bulk viscosity $\\zeta = \\lambda + \\frac{2}{3}\\mu$ quantifies the fluid's resistance to this volumetric deformation.\n\nWithout Stokes' hypothesis, the stresses $\\tau_{yy} = \\lambda\\alpha$ and $\\tau_{zz} = \\lambda\\alpha$ exist despite there being no strain rate in the $y$ and $z$ directions ($D_{yy}=D_{zz}=0$). These stresses are a direct consequence of the fluid's volumetric expansion rate $\\alpha = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}$. They represent the intrinsic resistance of the fluid to being expanded or compressed, a phenomenon characterized by the second viscosity coefficient $\\lambda$.\n\nInvoking Stokes' hypothesis is equivalent to assuming the bulk viscosity $\\zeta = 0$. This implies that the fluid offers no viscous resistance to pure volumetric change. Under this assumption, the trace of the viscous stress tensor is always zero: $\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\tau}) = \\tau_{xx}+\\tau_{yy}+\\tau_{zz} = \\frac{4}{3}\\mu\\alpha - \\frac{2}{3}\\mu\\alpha - \\frac{2}{3}\\mu\\alpha = 0$, which is consistent with the theoretical result $\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\tau}) = (3\\lambda + 2\\mu)\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{D})$. The non-zero stresses $\\tau_{yy} = -\\frac{2}{3}\\mu\\alpha$ and $\\tau_{zz} = -\\frac{2}{3}\\mu\\alpha$ no longer represent an intrinsic resistance to expansion. Instead, they manifest as reaction stresses, coupled to the shear viscosity $\\mu$, that must arise in the transverse directions to ensure the mean viscous normal stress is zero, a condition artificially imposed by the hypothesis. This assumption can lead to significant errors in modeling flows with strong compressibility effects, such as those involving shock waves, where the bulk viscosity is known to be physically significant.\n\nThe final results are collected as a single row matrix containing the six derived expressions in the specified order.",

In cylindrical coordinates, its components are given by:\n$$\n\\nabla\\mathbf{u} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial r}  \\frac{1}{r}\\left(\\frac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial \\theta} - u_\\theta\\right)  \\frac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial z} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial u_\\theta}{\\partial r}  \\frac{1}{r}\\left(\\frac{\\partial u_\\theta}{\\partial \\theta} + u_r\\right)  \\frac{\\partial u_\\theta}{\\partial z} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial r}  \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial \\theta}  \\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial z}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe calculate the required partial derivatives from the given velocity field:\n-   $\\frac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial r} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(-\\alpha r) = -\\alpha$\n-   $\\frac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$, $\\frac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial z} = 0$\n-   $\\frac{\\partial u_\\theta}{\\partial r} = 0$, $\\frac{\\partial u_\\theta}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$, $\\frac{\\partial u_\\theta}{\\partial z} = 0$\n-   $\\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial r} = 0$, $\\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$\n-   $\\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial z} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(2\\alpha z) = 2\\alpha$\n\nSubstituting these derivatives and the velocity components into the matrix for $\\nabla\\mathbf{u}$:\n$$\n\\nabla\\mathbf{u} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-\\alpha  \\frac{1}{r}(0 - 0)  0 \\\\\n0  \\frac{1}{r}(0 - \\alpha r)  0 \\\\\n0  0  2\\alpha\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-\\alpha  0  0 \\\\\n0  -\\alpha  0 \\\\\n0  0  2\\alpha\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe rate-of-deformation tensor $\\mathbf{D}$ is the symmetric part of the velocity gradient tensor:\n$$\n\\mathbf{D} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\nabla\\mathbf{u} + (\\nabla\\mathbf{u})^T \\right)\n$$\nSince the calculated $\\nabla\\mathbf{u}$ is a diagonal matrix, it is symmetric, meaning $(\\nabla\\mathbf{u})^T = \\nabla\\mathbf{u}$. Therefore, $\\mathbf{D} = \\nabla\\mathbf{u}$.\n$$\n\\mathbf{D} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nD_{rr}  D_{r\\theta}  D_{rz} \\\\\nD_{\\theta r}  D_{\\theta\\theta}  D_{\\theta z} \\\\\nD_{zr}  D_{z\\theta}  D_{zz}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-\\alpha  0  0 \\\\\n0  -\\alpha  0 \\\\\n0  0  2\\alpha\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe trace of the rate-of-deformation tensor, $\\operatorname{tr}(\\mathbf{D})$, is the sum of its diagonal components. This is also equal to the divergence of the velocity field, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}$.\n$$\n\\operatorname{tr}(\\mathbf{D}) = D_{rr} + D_{\\theta\\theta} + D_{zz} = (-\\alpha) + (-\\alpha) + (2\\alpha) = 0\n$$\nSo, the first required quantity is $\\operatorname{tr}(\\mathbf{D}) = 0$. This indicates that the flow field is incompressible (isochoric), even though the fluid itself is treated as compressible.\n\nNext, we use the constitutive relation for a compressible Newtonian fluid to find the Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$. It is given by:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = -p\\mathbf{I} + \\boldsymbol{\\tau}\n$$\nwhere $p$ is the thermodynamic pressure, $\\mathbf{I}$ is the identity tensor, and $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ is the viscous stress tensor. For a compressible Newtonian fluid, $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = 2\\mu\\mathbf{D} + \\lambda(\\operatorname{tr}(\\mathbf{D}))\\mathbf{I}\n$$\nHere, $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity and $\\lambda$ is the second (or bulk) viscosity. Combining these gives the full expression for the Cauchy stress tensor:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = -p\\mathbf{I} + 2\\mu\\mathbf{D} + \\lambda(\\operatorname{tr}(\\mathbf{D}))\\mathbf{I}\n$$\nWe have already found that $\\operatorname{tr}(\\mathbf{D}) = 0$. Substituting this into the equation simplifies it:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = -p\\mathbf{I} + 2\\mu\\mathbf{D} + \\lambda(0)\\mathbf{I} = -p\\mathbf{I} + 2\\mu\\mathbf{D}\n$$\nThis simplified form is identical to the constitutive relation for an incompressible fluid, which is expected since the flow field has zero divergence. The bulk viscosity $\\lambda$ has no effect on the stress for this particular flow.\n\nThe components of the Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ can be written in matrix form:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\sigma_{rr}  \\sigma_{r\\theta}  \\sigma_{rz} \\\\\n\\sigma_{\\theta r}  \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}  \\sigma_{\\theta z} \\\\\n\\sigma_{zr}  \\sigma_{z\\theta}  \\sigma_{zz}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= -p\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1  0  0 \\\\\n0  1  0 \\\\\n0  0  1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n+ 2\\mu\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nD_{rr}  D_{r\\theta}  D_{rz} \\\\\nD_{\\theta r}  D_{\\theta\\theta}  D_{\\theta z} \\\\\nD_{zr}  D_{z\\theta}  D_{zz}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe are asked for the normal stress components: $\\sigma_{rr}$, $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}$, and $\\sigma_{zz}$. These are the diagonal elements of the $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ tensor.\n$$\n\\sigma_{rr} = -p + 2\\mu D_{rr}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = -p + 2\\mu D_{\\theta\\theta}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{zz} = -p + 2\\mu D_{zz}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated components of $\\mathbf{D}$ ($D_{rr} = -\\alpha$, $D_{\\theta\\theta} = -\\alpha$, $D_{zz} = 2\\alpha$):\n$$\n\\sigma_{rr} = -p + 2\\mu(-\\alpha) = -p - 2\\mu\\alpha\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = -p + 2\\mu(-\\alpha) = -p - 2\\mu\\alpha\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{zz} = -p + 2\\mu(2\\alpha) = -p + 4\\mu\\alpha\n$$\nThe four required quantities are:\n1.  $\\operatorname{tr}(\\mathbf{D}) = 0$\n2.  $\\sigma_{rr} = -p - 2\\mu\\alpha$\n3.  $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = -p - 2\\mu\\alpha$\n4.  $\\sigma_{zz} = -p + 4\\mu\\alpha$\n\nThe problem asks for these to be reported as a single row vector.",
