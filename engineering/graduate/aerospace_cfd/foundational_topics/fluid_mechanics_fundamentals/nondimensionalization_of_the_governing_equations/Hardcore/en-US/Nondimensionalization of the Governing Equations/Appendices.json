A detailed solution will be developed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nFor dynamic similarity in a viscous, compressible flow of a calorically perfect gas, the governing Navier-Stokes equations must be made equivalent in their nondimensional form for both the full-scale flight (subscript $f$) and the wind-tunnel model (subscript $m$). Nondimensionalizing the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, along with the ideal gas law, reveals the following required conditions:\n1.  **Geometric Similarity:** The model must be a scaled replica of the flight vehicle. (This is satisfied, as both are wings of the same geometry).\n2.  **Similarity of Nondimensional Parameters:** The key parameters must be matched:\n    - Mach Number: $M_f = M_m$\n    - Reynolds Number: $Re_f = Re_m$\n    - Ratio of Specific Heats: $\\gamma_f = \\gamma_m$\n    - Prandtl Number: $Pr_f = Pr_m$\n\nSince both flight and test use air, the conditions $\\gamma_f = \\gamma_m \\approx 1.4$ and $Pr_f \\approx Pr_m \\approx 0.72$ are satisfied. The primary challenge is to simultaneously match the Mach and Reynolds numbers.\n\nFirst, we calculate the flight parameters:\n- Flight Mach Number: $M_f = \\frac{U_f}{a_f} = \\frac{230\\,\\mathrm{m/s}}{316\\,\\mathrm{m/s}} \\approx 0.7278$\n- Flight Reynolds Number: $Re_f = \\frac{\\rho_f U_f c_f}{\\mu_f} = \\frac{(0.38\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^3})(230\\,\\mathrm{m/s})(2.0\\,\\mathrm{m})}{1.5\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s}} \\approx 1.165 \\times 10^7$\n\nThe flight condition is transonic. In this regime, flow characteristics such as pressure distribution, shock wave formation and position, lift, and wave drag are highly sensitive to the Mach number.\n\nNow, we assess the feasibility of matching these parameters in the wind tunnel under the given constraints.\n\n**Can we match the Mach number? ($M_m = M_f \\approx 0.7278$)**\nTo match the Mach number, the required tunnel speed $U_m$ would be:\n$U_m = M_f \\cdot a_m = M_f \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_m} \\approx 0.7278 \\sqrt{1.4 \\times 287 \\times T_m} \\approx 14.58\\sqrt{T_m}$\nThe tunnel temperature $T_m$ is in the range $[250\\,\\mathrm{K}, 300\\,\\mathrm{K}]$.\n- For the lowest temperature $T_m = 250\\,\\mathrm{K}$, the required speed is $U_m \\approx 14.58\\sqrt{250} \\approx 230.5\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$.\n- For the highest temperature $T_m = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$, the required speed is $U_m \\approx 14.58\\sqrt{300} \\approx 252.5\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$.\nThe facility's maximum speed is $U_m \\le 180\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$. Since the minimum required speed ($230.5\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$) to match $M_f$ is well above the facility's limit, **it is impossible to match the flight Mach number.**\n\nThe maximum achievable Mach number in the tunnel is at maximum speed ($U_m = 180\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$) and minimum temperature (which minimizes the speed of sound $a_m$).\n- At $T_m = 250\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $a_m = \\sqrt{1.4 \\times 287 \\times 250} \\approx 316.9\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$.\n- $M_{m,max} = \\frac{180\\,\\mathrm{m/s}}{316.9\\,\\mathrm{m/s}} \\approx 0.568$.\nThe tunnel can only achieve a subsonic Mach number significantly lower than the flight's transonic Mach number.\n\n**Can we match the Reynolds number? ($Re_m = Re_f \\approx 1.17 \\times 10^7$)**\nSince Mach number matching is impossible, a common alternative strategy is to prioritize Reynolds number matching to study viscous phenomena. This requires setting $U_m$ and tuning the density $\\rho_m$ (via pressure) to achieve the target $Re_f$. We should attempt this at the maximum possible speed, $U_m = 180\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, to minimize the required density.\n$Re_m = \\frac{\\rho_m U_m c_m}{\\mu_m} \\implies \\rho_m = \\frac{Re_f \\mu_m(T_m)}{U_m c_m} = \\frac{1.165 \\times 10^7 \\cdot \\mu_m(T_m)}{(180\\,\\mathrm{m/s}) (0.4\\,\\mathrm{m})} \\approx 1.618 \\times 10^5 \\cdot \\mu_m(T_m)$\n\nThe density $\\rho_m$ depends on the total pressure $P_{0,m}$ and static temperature $T_m$.\n$\\rho_m = \\frac{P_m}{R T_m} = \\frac{P_{0,m}}{R T_m} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_m^2\\right)^{-\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}}$\nTo check feasibility, we must calculate the required total pressure $P_{0,m}$ and see if it is within the $2\\,\\mathrm{atm}$ limit ($202650\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$). We should check the condition at the boundaries of the temperature range, as this is where the optimum (lowest required pressure) will likely be found.\nLet's analyze the case at $T_m=250\\,\\mathrm{K}$ (which gives the highest achievable $Re_m$ for a fixed pressure, as shown below).\n- At $T_m = 250\\,\\mathrm{K}$, using Sutherland's law, $\\mu_m \\approx 1.60 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s}$.\n- $a_m \\approx 316.9\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$ and $M_m \\approx 0.568$.\n- The required density is $\\rho_m \\approx 1.618 \\times 10^5 \\times (1.60 \\times 10^{-5}) \\approx 2.59\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^3}$.\n- The required static pressure is $P_m = \\rho_m R T_m = 2.59 \\times 287 \\times 250 \\approx 185800\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.\n- The required total pressure is $P_{0,m} = P_m \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_m^2\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}} = 185800 \\times (1 + 0.2 \\times 0.568^2)^{3.5} \\approx 185800 \\times 1.243 \\approx 230950\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.\nThis required total pressure ($2.31 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, or $\\approx 2.28\\,\\mathrm{atm}$) exceeds the facility limit of $2\\,\\mathrm{atm}$.\nLet's calculate the maximum achievable Reynolds number with the facility limits ($P_{0,m}=2\\,\\mathrm{atm}$, $U_m=180\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, $T_m=250\\,\\mathrm{K}$).\n$P_{m} = P_{0,m} / 1.243 = 202650 / 1.243 \\approx 163033\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.\n$\\rho_{m} = P_{m} / (R T_m) = 163033 / (287 \\times 250) \\approx 2.272\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^3}$.\n$Re_{m,max} = \\frac{\\rho_m U_m c_m}{\\mu_m} = \\frac{2.272 \\times 180 \\times 0.4}{1.60 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx 1.02 \\times 10^7$.\nThe maximum achievable Reynolds number is $1.02 \\times 10^7$, which is less than the target flight Reynolds number of $1.17 \\times 10^7$.\nThus, **it is also impossible to exactly match the flight Reynolds number.**\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Dynamic similarity for viscous, compressible airflows with negligible heat transfer requires geometric similarity, identical boundary conditions, and equality of the Mach number M, Reynolds number Re, and gas thermodynamic character (same $\\gamma$; the Prandtl number Pr is not rate-controlling for isothermal walls). When facility limits preclude matching both M and Re, one must prioritize the parameter controlling the phenomena of interest: M for compressibility-driven pressure distributions and shocks, Re for viscous boundary-layer transition, separation, and skin-friction drag. For the given constraints, matching $M_f = U_f/a_f \\approx 0.73$ is infeasible because $U_m \\le 180\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$ and $a_m = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_m}$ lies in $[317, 347]\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$ for $T_m \\in [250,300]\\,\\mathrm{K}$, so $M_m \\in [180/347, 180/317] \\approx [0.52, 0.57]$. However, $Re_f = \\rho_f U_f c_f/\\mu_f \\approx 1.17\\times 10^7$ can be matched at $U_m = 180\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$ by increasing density via pressure at $T_m \\in [250,300]\\,\\mathrm{K}$, yielding credible viscous metrics if the boundary-layer state is made similar (e.g., tripping to control transition), while accepting errors in shock position and lift due to M mismatch.**\n\nThis option correctly states the principles of dynamic similarity and the engineering trade-offs. The numerical calculation that matching $M_f$ is infeasible is correct, as is the calculation of the achievable $M_m$ range at maximum speed.\nThe statement that $Re_f$ \"can be matched\" is, by exacting calculation, incorrect. The maximum achievable $Re_m$ is approximately $1.02 \\times 10^7$, while the target is $1.17 \\times 10^7$. However, the ability to reach a Reynolds number that is fairly close (approximately $87\\%$ of the target) makes the subsequent analysis meaningful. In the context of the available choices, this inaccuracy is minor compared to the fundamental errors in other options. The analysis of the trade-off is perfectly sound: since matching $M_f$ is impossible, one could choose to get as close as possible to $Re_f$ to study viscous effects, while acknowledging the data will be incorrect for compressibility-dependent phenomena like shock position and lift. Among the given choices, this option presents the most physically correct and comprehensive analysis of the situation.\n**Verdict: Correct** (The best and most complete description, despite a minor numerical overstatement).\n\n**B. Matching dynamic pressure $q = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\rho U^2$ and geometric similarity is sufficient to guarantee dynamic similarity of aerodynamic coefficients for compressible, viscous flows; explicit matching of $M$ and $Re$ is unnecessary if $q$ is identical.**\n\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. Dynamic pressure $q$ is a reference quantity used to define aerodynamic coefficients, not a similarity parameter itself. Nondimensionalization of the governing equations proves that $M$ and $Re$ (along with $\\gamma$ and $Pr$) are the required parameters. Two flows with the same dynamic pressure but vastly different Mach numbers (e.g., incompressible vs. supersonic) will have completely different physics and thus different aerodynamic coefficients.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. If both $M$ and $Re$ cannot be matched in air, switching to a heavy gas such as sulfur hexafluoride to simultaneously lower the speed of sound and raise density guarantees exact similarity, even though the gas has different ratio of specific heats $\\gamma$ and Prandtl number $Pr$ than air.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because it ignores a critical similarity parameter. While using a heavy gas is a valid technique to help match $M$ and $Re$ simultaneously, it is only valid if the new gas has the same $\\gamma$ and $Pr$ as air. Sulfur hexafluoride ($SF_6$) is a polyatomic gas with $\\gamma \\approx 1.09$, which is significantly different from air's $\\gamma \\approx 1.4$. This difference in $\\gamma$ would fundamentally alter the compressible flow physics (e.g., isentropic relations, shock properties), invalidating the test for predicting flight in air. The claim that this \"guarantees exact similarity\" is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. For slender wings at $M_f \\lesssim 0.8$, matching only $Re$ while accepting a mismatch in $M$ still yields accurate pressure distributions and lift because compressibility corrections such as the Prandtl–Glauert relation can recover the effect of Mach number over the entire transonic-subsonic range; therefore, priority should always be given to $Re$ when both cannot be matched.**\n\nThis statement contains multiple errors. Firstly, the Prandtl–Glauert relation is a linearized theory correction valid only for subcritical, attached subsonic flows, not for the \"entire transonic-subsonic range.\" It cannot account for the highly nonlinear effects of shock waves present in transonic flow ($M_f \\approx 0.73$ is transonic). Secondly, the assertion that priority should \"always\" be given to $Re$ is wrong. For transonic flight, where compressibility effects are dominant, Mach number is the most critical parameter for pressure distribution, lift, and wave drag. Prioritizing $Re$ while having a large $M$ mismatch (e.g., testing at $M_m \\approx 0.57$ for flight at $M_f \\approx 0.73$) would lead to grossly inaccurate predictions for these key aerodynamic quantities.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",

For large $r$, $(\\mathbf{U}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{u}'$ decays as $r^{-2}$, while $(\\mathbf{u}'\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{u}'$ decays as $r^{-3}$; hence the leading inertial contribution is\n$$\n\\text{inertia} \\sim \\rho\\,|(\\mathbf{U}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{u}'|\\sim \\rho\\,U\\,|\\nabla\\mathbf{u}'|.\n$$\nUsing $|\\mathbf{u}'|\\sim U L/r$ and the far-field derivative scaling $|\\nabla \\mathbf{u}'|\\sim |\\mathbf{u}'|/r \\sim U L/r^{2}$, we obtain\n$$\n\\text{inertia} \\sim \\rho\\,U^{2}\\,\\frac{L}{r^{2}}.\n$$\n\nFor the viscous term, away from the object $|\\nabla^{2}\\mathbf{u}'|\\sim |\\mathbf{u}'|/r^{2}\\sim U L/r^{3}$, so\n$$\n\\text{viscous} \\sim \\mu\\,|\\nabla^{2}\\mathbf{u}'|\\sim \\mu\\,U\\,\\frac{L}{r^{3}}.\n$$\n\nThe Stokes approximation fails where the neglected inertial term becomes comparable to the viscous term.

Both forms are identical; the former is expressed directly using $\\rho$, $\\mu$, $U$, and is independent of the object size $L$.",
