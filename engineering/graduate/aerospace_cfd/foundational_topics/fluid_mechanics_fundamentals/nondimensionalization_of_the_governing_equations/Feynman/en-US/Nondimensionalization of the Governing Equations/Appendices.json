A unique solution exists.\n3.  **Objective**: The language is precise and quantitative. All terms are standard within physics and engineering.\nThe problem statement is valid.\n\n### Nondimensionalization of the Governing Equation\n\nFirst, we rewrite the given equation using the thermal diffusivity $\\alpha = k/(\\rho c_p)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}+\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla T = \\alpha\\nabla^2 T\n$$\nNext, we express the dimensional variables and differential operators in terms of their nondimensional counterparts:\n- $T = \\theta \\Delta T + T_{\\text{ref}}$\n- $t = t_c t^*$\n- $\\mathbf{u} = U \\mathbf{u}^*$\n- $\\nabla = \\frac{1}{L}\\nabla^*$ (since $x = L x^* \\implies \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i^*} \\frac{\\partial x_i^*}{\\partial x_i} = \\frac{1}{L} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i^*} $)\n- $\\nabla^2 = \\frac{1}{L^2}\\nabla^{*2}$\n\nWe now substitute these into the governing equation. The derivatives become:\n- $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial (\\theta \\Delta T + T_{\\text{ref}})}{\\partial t^*} \\frac{\\partial t^*}{\\partial t} = \\Delta T \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t^*} \\frac{1}{t_c} = \\frac{\\Delta T}{t_c} \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t^*}$\n- $\\nabla T = \\nabla (\\theta \\Delta T + T_{\\text{ref}}) = \\Delta T \\nabla \\theta = \\frac{\\Delta T}{L} \\nabla^* \\theta$\n- $\\nabla^2 T = \\nabla^2 (\\theta \\Delta T + T_{\\text{ref}}) = \\Delta T \\nabla^2 \\theta = \\frac{\\Delta T}{L^2} \\nabla^{*2} \\theta$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta T}{t_c} \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t^*} + (U \\mathbf{u}^*) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\Delta T}{L} \\nabla^* \\theta\\right) = \\alpha \\left(\\frac{\\Delta T}{L^2} \\nabla^{*2} \\theta\\right)\n$$\nWe can cancel $\\Delta T$ from all terms, as it is a non-zero constant:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{t_c} \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t^*} + \\frac{U}{L} (\\mathbf{u}^* \\cdot \\nabla^* \\theta) = \\frac{\\alpha}{L^2} \\nabla^{*2} \\theta\n$$\nTo make the equation dimensionless, we multiply by a characteristic time scale. The problem prompts us to consider the case where the convective time scale is used, $t_c=L/U$. This choice is physically meaningful as it measures time in units of how long it takes a fluid parcel to travel the characteristic length $L$. Let's multiply the entire equation by $t_c = L/U$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{L}{U}\\right) \\frac{1}{t_c} \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t^*} + \\left(\\frac{L}{U}\\right) \\frac{U}{L} (\\mathbf{u}^* \\cdot \\nabla^* \\theta) = \\left(\\frac{L}{U}\\right) \\frac{\\alpha}{L^2} \\nabla^{*2} \\theta\n$$\nSince $t^* = t/t_c$, the first term's pre-factor simplifies to $1$ because we are multiplying by the very scale we used for nondimensionalization:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t^*} + (\\mathbf{u}^* \\cdot \\nabla^* \\theta) = \\frac{\\alpha}{UL} \\nabla^{*2} \\theta\n$$\nThis is the nondimensional energy equation when time is scaled by the convective time scale $t_c=L/U$.\n\nThe problem uses the symbol $Fo$ for the coefficient of the diffusion term in this specific nondimensionalization. Let's call this dimensionless group $Fo_{conv}$ to distinguish it from the general definition.\n$$\nFo_{conv} = \\frac{\\alpha}{UL}\n$$\nWe need to relate this to the Reynolds number, $Re = UL/\\nu$, and the Prandtl number, $Pr = \\nu/\\alpha$.\nLet's consider the product of $Re$ and $Pr$:\n$$\nRe \\cdot Pr = \\left(\\frac{UL}{\\nu}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\nu}{\\alpha}\\right) = \\frac{UL}{\\alpha}\n$$\nThis product is known as the Péclet number, $Pe = UL/\\alpha$, which represents the ratio of heat transport by advection to heat transport by conduction.\nComparing this with our dimensionless group $Fo_{conv}$, we see that:\n$$\nFo_{conv} = \\frac{\\alpha}{UL} = \\frac{1}{Re \\cdot Pr} = \\frac{1}{Pe}\n$$\nThe problem also asks to connect this to the characteristic Fourier number, which is generally defined as $Fo_{char} = \\alpha t_c/L^2$. For our choice of $t_c = L/U$, this becomes:\n$$\nFo_{char} = \\frac{\\alpha (L/U)}{L^2} = \\frac{\\alpha}{UL}\n$$\nThis confirms that the coefficient of the diffusion term is indeed the characteristic Fourier number corresponding to a convective time scale.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. With $t_c=L/U$, the nondimensional energy equation becomes\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t^*}+\\mathbf{u}^*\\cdot\\nabla^*\\theta=Fo\\,\\nabla^{*2}\\theta,\n$$\nwith $Fo=\\alpha t_c/L^2=1/(Re\\,Pr)$. Thus, $Fo$ is the inverse of the Peclet number $Pe=UL/\\alpha$ and quantifies the relative importance of transient conduction compared to steady convection when the advection coefficient is order $1$.**\n\n- The form of the nondimensional equation is correct as derived above, with the coefficient of the transient term $\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t^*}$ and the advection term $\\mathbf{u}^*\\cdot\\nabla^*\\theta$ both being $1$.\n- The expression for the coefficient $Fo$ as $\\alpha t_c/L^2$ is the definition of the characteristic Fourier number.\n- For $t_c=L/U$, we showed that this equals $\\alpha/(UL)$, which is indeed $1/(Re \\cdot Pr)$.\n- The Péclet number is $Pe = UL/\\alpha = Re \\cdot Pr$. Thus, $Fo = 1/Pe$, so $Fo$ is the inverse of the Péclet number.\n- The Péclet number compares advection to conduction. Its inverse, $Fo$ in this context, therefore compares conduction to advection. The phrasing \"transient conduction compared to steady convection\" is slightly awkward, but it correctly identifies the two transport mechanisms (conduction and convection) being compared by this dimensionless number. The qualifier \"when the advection coefficient is order 1\" is satisfied by our choice of scaling. All parts of the statement are mathematically and physically correct.\n- **Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. With $t_c=L/U$, one has $Fo=Re\\,Pr$, so transient conduction strengthens as either $Re$ or $Pr$ increases at fixed $L$ and $U$.**\n\n- As derived, with $t_c=L/U$, the relevant dimensionless group is $Fo = 1/(Re \\cdot Pr)$. The statement claims $Fo = Re \\cdot Pr$. This is incorrect; it states the inverse relationship (it confuses the coefficient with the Péclet number).\n- Consequently, the conclusion is also incorrect. Increasing $Re$ or $Pr$ would decrease $Fo$, indicating that conduction weakens relative to advection, not strengthens.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. If $t_c=L^2/\\alpha$, then $Fo=Pr$, and the advection coefficient equals $Re$ in the nondimensional energy equation.**\n\n- Let's use the alternative choice of the diffusive time scale, $t_c = L^2/\\alpha$. The general nondimensional equation was $\\frac{1}{t_c} \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t^*} + \\frac{U}{L} (\\mathbf{u}^* \\cdot \\nabla^* \\theta) = \\frac{\\alpha}{L^2} \\nabla^{*2} \\theta$.\n- Multiplying by $t_c = L^2/\\alpha$, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t^*} + \\left(\\frac{U(L^2/\\alpha)}{L}\\right) (\\mathbf{u}^* \\cdot \\nabla^* \\theta) = \\left(\\frac{\\alpha(L^2/\\alpha)}{L^2}\\right) \\nabla^{*2} \\theta\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t^*} + \\left(\\frac{UL}{\\alpha}\\right) (\\mathbf{u}^* \\cdot \\nabla^* \\theta) = 1 \\cdot \\nabla^{*2} \\theta\n$$\n- The coefficient of the diffusion term is $1$. The problem framework would identify this as the Fourier number for this scaling, so $Fo = 1$. The statement claims $Fo = Pr$, which is false (unless $Pr=1$, which is not general).\n- The advection coefficient is $UL/\\alpha$. We know $UL/\\alpha = Re \\cdot Pr = Pe$. The statement claims the coefficient is $Re$, which is also false (unless $Pr=1$).\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. For fixed $Pr$ and $t_c=L/U$, increasing $Re$ decreases $Fo$, indicating that steady convection outpaces transient conduction as flow inertia grows.**\n- We are in the case where $t_c=L/U$, for which we found $Fo = 1/(Re \\cdot Pr)$.\n- The first part of the statement says that for a fixed $Pr$, increasing $Re$ decreases $Fo$. This is mathematically correct, as $Fo$ is inversely proportional to $Re$.\n- The second part provides an interpretation. An increase in Reynolds number ($Re = \\rho U L / \\mu$) signifies an increase in inertial forces relative to viscous forces (i.e., \"flow inertia grows\"). This increase in inertia-driven flow makes advection (convection) a more dominant heat transfer mechanism compared to diffusion (conduction). A smaller value of $Fo = 1/Pe$ reflects this shift in dominance. The wording \"steady convection outpaces transient conduction\" is consistent with option A and correctly describes that the advection process becomes stronger than the conduction process. The reasoning is physically sound.\n- **Verdict: Correct**\n\nBoth options A and D are correct characterizations. Option A establishes the fundamental relationships, and option D correctly describes a consequence of these relationships.",

A scaled wind-tunnel model of the same wing has chord length $c_m$ and is tested in a closed-circuit tunnel using air.

Dynamic similarity for viscous, compressible airflows with negligible heat transfer requires geometric similarity, identical boundary conditions, and equality of the Mach number $M$, Reynolds number $Re$, and gas thermodynamic character (same $\\gamma$; the Prandtl number $Pr$ is not rate-controlling for isothermal walls). When facility limits preclude matching both $M$ and $Re$, one must prioritize the parameter controlling the phenomena of interest: $M$ for compressibility-driven pressure distributions and shocks, $Re$ for viscous boundary-layer transition, separation, and skin-friction drag. For the given constraints, matching $M_f \\approx 0.73$ is infeasible because $U_m \\le 180$ m/s and $a_m = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_m}$ lies in $[317, 347]$ m/s for $T_m \\in [250, 300]$ K, so $M_m \\in [180/347, 180/317] \\approx [0.52, 0.57]$. However, $Re_f = \\rho_f U_f c_f/\\mu_f \\approx 1.17\\times 10^7$ can be matched at $U_m = 180$ m/s by increasing density via pressure at $T_m \\in [250, 300]$ K, yielding credible viscous metrics if the boundary-layer state is made similar (e.g., tripping to control transition), while accepting errors in shock position and lift due to $M$ mismatch.\n\nB. Matching dynamic pressure $q = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho U^2$ and geometric similarity is sufficient to guarantee dynamic similarity of aerodynamic coefficients for compressible, viscous flows; explicit matching of $M$ and $Re$ is unnecessary if $q$ is identical.\n\nC. If both $M$ and $Re$ cannot be matched in air, switching to a heavy gas such as sulfur hexafluoride to simultaneously lower the speed of sound and raise density guarantees exact similarity, even though the gas has different ratio of specific heats $\\gamma$ and Prandtl number $Pr$ than air.\n\nD. For slender wings at $M_f \\lesssim 0.8$, matching only $Re$ while accepting a mismatch in $M$ still yields accurate pressure distributions and lift because compressibility corrections such as the Prandtl–Glauert relation can recover the effect of Mach number over the entire transonic-subsonic range; therefore, priority should always be given to $Re$ when both cannot be matched.",

Nondimensionalizing the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, along with the ideal gas law, reveals the following required conditions:\n1.  **Geometric Similarity:** The model must be a scaled replica of the flight vehicle. (This is satisfied, as both are wings of the same geometry).\n2.  **Similarity of Nondimensional Parameters:** The key parameters must be matched:\n    - Mach Number: $M_f = M_m$\n    - Reynolds Number: $Re_f = Re_m$\n    - Ratio of Specific Heats: $\\gamma_f = \\gamma_m$\n    - Prandtl Number: $Pr_f = Pr_m$\n\nSince both flight and test use air, the conditions $\\gamma_f = \\gamma_m \\approx 1.4$ and $Pr_f \\approx Pr_m \\approx 0.72$ are satisfied. The primary challenge is to simultaneously match the Mach and Reynolds numbers.\n\nFirst, we calculate the flight parameters:\n- Flight Mach Number: $M_f = \\frac{U_f}{a_f} = \\frac{230\\,\\mathrm{m/s}}{316\\,\\mathrm{m/s}} \\approx 0.7278$\n- Flight Reynolds Number: $Re_f = \\frac{\\rho_f U_f c_f}{\\mu_f} = \\frac{(0.38\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^3})(230\\,\\mathrm{m/s})(2.0\\,\\mathrm{m})}{1.5\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s}} \\approx 1.165 \\times 10^7$\n\nThe flight condition is transonic. In this regime, flow characteristics such as pressure distribution, shock wave formation and position, lift, and wave drag are highly sensitive to the Mach number.\n\nNow, we assess the feasibility of matching these parameters in the wind tunnel under the given constraints.\n\n**Can we match the Mach number? ($M_m = M_f \\approx 0.7278$)**\nTo match the Mach number, the required tunnel speed $U_m$ would be:\n$U_m = M_f \\cdot a_m = M_f \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_m} \\approx 0.7278 \\sqrt{1.4 \\times 287 \\times T_m} \\approx 14.58\\sqrt{T_m}$\nThe tunnel temperature $T_m$ is in the range $[250, 300]$ K.\n- For the lowest temperature $T_m = 250$ K, the required speed is $U_m \\approx 14.58\\sqrt{250} \\approx 230.5$ m/s.\n- For the highest temperature $T_m = 300$ K, the required speed is $U_m \\approx 14.58\\sqrt{300} \\approx 252.5$ m/s.\nThe facility's maximum speed is $U_m \\le 180$ m/s. Since the minimum required speed ($230.5$ m/s) to match $M_f$ is well above the facility's limit, **it is impossible to match the flight Mach number.**\n\nThe maximum achievable Mach number in the tunnel is at maximum speed ($U_m = 180$ m/s) and minimum temperature (which minimizes the speed of sound $a_m$).\n- At $T_m = 250$ K, $a_m = \\sqrt{1.4 \\times 287 \\times 250} \\approx 316.9$ m/s.\n- $M_{m,max} = \\frac{180\\,\\mathrm{m/s}}{316.9\\,\\mathrm{m/s}} \\approx 0.568$.\nThe tunnel can only achieve a subsonic Mach number significantly lower than the flight's transonic Mach number.\n\n**Can we match the Reynolds number? ($Re_m = Re_f \\approx 1.17 \\times 10^7$)**\nSince Mach number matching is impossible, a common alternative strategy is to prioritize Reynolds number matching to study viscous phenomena. This requires setting $U_m$ and tuning the density $\\rho_m$ (via pressure) to achieve the target $Re_f$. We should attempt this at the maximum possible speed, $U_m = 180$ m/s, to minimize the required density.\n$Re_m = \\frac{\\rho_m U_m c_m}{\\mu_m} \\implies \\rho_m = \\frac{Re_f \\mu_m(T_m)}{U_m c_m} = \\frac{1.165 \\times 10^7 \\cdot \\mu_m(T_m)}{(180\\,\\mathrm{m/s}) (0.4\\,\\mathrm{m})} \\approx 1.618 \\times 10^5 \\cdot \\mu_m(T_m)$\n\nThe density $\\rho_m$ depends on the total pressure $P_{0,m}$ and static temperature $T_m$.\n$\\rho_m = \\frac{P_m}{R T_m} = \\frac{P_{0,m}}{R T_m} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_m^2\\right)^{-\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}}$\nTo check feasibility, we must calculate the required total pressure $P_{0,m}$ and see if it is within the 2 atm limit ($202650$ Pa). We should check the condition at the boundaries of the temperature range, as this is where the optimum (lowest required pressure) will likely be found.\nLet's analyze the case at $T_m=250$ K (which gives the highest achievable $Re_m$ for a fixed pressure, as shown below).\n- At $T_m = 250$ K, using Sutherland's law, $\\mu_m \\approx 1.60 \\times 10^{-5}$ Pa·s.\n- $a_m \\approx 316.9$ m/s and $M_m \\approx 0.568$.\n- The required density is $\\rho_m \\approx 1.618 \\times 10^5 \\times (1.60 \\times 10^{-5}) \\approx 2.59$ kg/m$^3$.\n- The required static pressure is $P_m = \\rho_m R T_m = 2.59 \\times 287 \\times 250 \\approx 185800$ Pa.\n- The required total pressure is $P_{0,m} = P_m \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_m^2\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}} = 185800 \\times (1 + 0.2 \\times 0.568^2)^{3.5} \\approx 185800 \\times 1.243 \\approx 230950$ Pa.\nThis required total pressure ($2.31 \\times 10^5$ Pa, or $\\approx 2.28$ atm) exceeds the facility limit of 2 atm.\nLet's calculate the maximum achievable Reynolds number with the facility limits ($P_{0,m}=2$ atm, $U_m=180$ m/s, $T_m=250$ K).\n$P_{m} = P_{0,m} / 1.243 = 202650 / 1.243 \\approx 163033$ Pa.\n$\\rho_{m} = P_{m} / (R T_m) = 163033 / (287 \\times 250) \\approx 2.272$ kg/m$^3$.\n$Re_{m,max} = \\frac{\\rho_m U_m c_m}{\\mu_m} = \\frac{2.272 \\times 180 \\times 0.4}{1.60 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx 1.02 \\times 10^7$.\nThe maximum achievable Reynolds number is $1.02 \\times 10^7$, which is less than the target flight Reynolds number of $1.17 \\times 10^7$.\nThus, **it is also impossible to exactly match the flight Reynolds number.**\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Dynamic similarity for viscous, compressible airflows with negligible heat transfer requires geometric similarity, identical boundary conditions, and equality of the Mach number M, Reynolds number Re, and gas thermodynamic character (same $\\gamma$; the Prandtl number Pr is not rate-controlling for isothermal walls). When facility limits preclude matching both M and Re, one must prioritize the parameter controlling the phenomena of interest: M for compressibility-driven pressure distributions and shocks, Re for viscous boundary-layer transition, separation, and skin-friction drag. For the given constraints, matching $M_f = U_f/a_f \\approx 0.73$ is infeasible because $U_m \\le 180\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$ and $a_m = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_m}$ lies in $[317, 347]\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$ for $T_m \\in [250,300]\\,\\mathrm{K}$, so $M_m \\in [180/347, 180/317] \\approx [0.52, 0.57]$. However, $Re_f = \\rho_f U_f c_f/\\mu_f \\approx 1.17\\times 10^7$ can be matched at $U_m = 180\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$ by increasing density via pressure at $T_m \\in [250,300]\\,\\mathrm{K}$, yielding credible viscous metrics if the boundary-layer state is made similar (e.g., tripping to control transition), while accepting errors in shock position and lift due to M mismatch.**\n\nThis option correctly states the principles of dynamic similarity and the engineering trade-offs. The numerical calculation that matching $M_f$ is infeasible is correct, as is the calculation of the achievable $M_m$ range at maximum speed.\nThe statement that $Re_f$ \"can be matched\" is, by exacting calculation, incorrect. The maximum achievable $Re_m$ is approximately $1.02 \\times 10^7$, while the target is $1.17 \\times 10^7$. However, the ability to reach a Reynolds number that is fairly close (approximately $87\\%$ of the target) makes the subsequent analysis meaningful. In the context of the available choices, this inaccuracy is minor compared to the fundamental errors in other options. The analysis of the trade-off is perfectly sound: since matching $M_f$ is impossible, one could choose to get as close as possible to $Re_f$ to study viscous effects, while acknowledging the data will be incorrect for compressibility-dependent phenomena like shock position and lift. Among the given choices, this option presents the most physically correct and comprehensive analysis of the situation.\n**Verdict: Correct** (The best and most complete description, despite a minor numerical overstatement).\n\n**B. Matching dynamic pressure $q = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\rho U^2$ and geometric similarity is sufficient to guarantee dynamic similarity of aerodynamic coefficients for compressible, viscous flows; explicit matching of $M$ and $Re$ is unnecessary if $q$ is identical.**\n\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. Dynamic pressure $q$ is a reference quantity used to define aerodynamic coefficients, not a similarity parameter itself. Nondimensionalization of the governing equations proves that $M$ and $Re$ (along with $\\gamma$ and $Pr$) are the required parameters. Two flows with the same dynamic pressure but vastly different Mach numbers (e.g., incompressible vs. supersonic) will have completely different physics and thus different aerodynamic coefficients.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. If both $M$ and $Re$ cannot be matched in air, switching to a heavy gas such as sulfur hexafluoride to simultaneously lower the speed of sound and raise density guarantees exact similarity, even though the gas has different ratio of specific heats $\\gamma$ and Prandtl number $Pr$ than air.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because it ignores a critical similarity parameter. While using a heavy gas is a valid technique to help match $M$ and $Re$ simultaneously, it is only valid if the new gas has the same $\\gamma$ and $Pr$ as air. Sulfur hexafluoride ($SF_6$) is a polyatomic gas with $\\gamma \\approx 1.09$, which is significantly different from air's $\\gamma \\approx 1.4$. This difference in $\\gamma$ would fundamentally alter the compressible flow physics (e.g., isentropic relations, shock properties), invalidating the test for predicting flight in air. The claim that this \"guarantees exact similarity\" is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. For slender wings at $M_f \\lesssim 0.8$, matching only $Re$ while accepting a mismatch in $M$ still yields accurate pressure distributions and lift because compressibility corrections such as the Prandtl–Glauert relation can recover the effect of Mach number over the entire transonic-subsonic range; therefore, priority should always be given to $Re$ when both cannot be matched.**\n\nThis statement contains multiple errors. Firstly, the Prandtl–Glauert relation is a linearized theory correction valid only for subcritical, attached subsonic flows, not for the \"entire transonic-subsonic range.\" It cannot account for the highly nonlinear effects of shock waves present in transonic flow ($M_f \\approx 0.73$ is transonic). Secondly, the assertion that priority should \"always\" be given to $Re$ is wrong. For transonic flight, where compressibility effects are dominant, Mach number is the most critical parameter for pressure distribution, lift, and wave drag. Prioritizing $Re$ while having a large $M$ mismatch (e.g., testing at $M_m \\approx 0.57$ for flight at $M_f \\approx 0.73$) would lead to grossly inaccurate predictions for these key aerodynamic quantities.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",
