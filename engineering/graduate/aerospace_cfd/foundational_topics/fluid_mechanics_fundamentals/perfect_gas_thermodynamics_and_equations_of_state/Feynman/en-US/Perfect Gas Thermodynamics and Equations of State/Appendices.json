Density is defined as mass per unit volume, $\\rho = \\frac{m}{V}$.

Dry air is composed primarily of diatomic molecules ($N_2$ and $O_2$). According to the kinetic theory of gases, the molar internal energy of an ideal gas is related to its active degrees of freedom, $f$. At a temperature of $300\\,\\mathrm{K}$ (room temperature), the translational ($f_{trans}=3$) and rotational ($f_{rot}=2$) energy modes are fully excited, while the vibrational modes are effectively \"frozen\" and do not contribute significantly to the internal energy.\nThus, the total number of active degrees of freedom is $f = f_{trans} + f_{rot} = 3 + 2 = 5$.\n\nThe molar specific heat at constant volume is given by $C_v = \\frac{f}{2} \\mathcal{R}_u$, where $\\mathcal{R}_u$ is the universal gas constant. For $f=5$, this gives $C_v = \\frac{5}{2} \\mathcal{R}_u$. The molar specific heat at constant pressure is $C_p = C_v + \\mathcal{R}_u = \\frac{7}{2} \\mathcal{R}_u$.\nThe theoretical ratio of specific heats for a diatomic gas with frozen vibrational modes is therefore:\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{C_p}{C_v} = \\frac{\\frac{7}{2}\\mathcal{R}_u}{\\frac{5}{2}\\mathcal{R}_u} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$$\nOur calculated value of $\\gamma \\approx 1.3997$ is extremely close to the theoretical value of $1.4$. This excellent agreement confirms that at $300\\,\\mathrm{K}$, the vibrational modes of $N_2$ and $O_2$ are not significantly excited. Since the specific heats only change when additional energy modes (like vibration) become active at higher temperatures (typically above $T \\approx 800\\,\\mathrm{K}$ for air), the assumption that $c_p$ and $c_v$ are constant is highly valid at and around $300\\,\\mathrm{K}$. Therefore, modeling air as a calorically perfect gas is a very accurate approximation in typical compressible CFD applications where temperatures remain moderate, such as in subsonic and low-supersonic flight regimes.\n\nThe required numerical results are $c_v=718\\,\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$ and $\\gamma=1.3997$.",
