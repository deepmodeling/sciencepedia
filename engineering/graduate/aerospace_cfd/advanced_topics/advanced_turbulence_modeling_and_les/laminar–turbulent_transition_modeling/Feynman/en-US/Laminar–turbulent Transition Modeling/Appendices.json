It is scientifically grounded in the principles of boundary layer theory, specifically the Blasius solution for a laminar boundary layer over a flat plate. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution without any internal contradictions or reliance on implausible assumptions.\n\nThe objective is to determine the streamwise location $x$ at which the momentum-thickness Reynolds number, $Re_{\\theta}$, reaches a specified threshold value. We are given the definitions for the Reynolds numbers and the expression for the momentum thickness, $\\theta$, for a Blasius boundary layer.\n\nThe momentum-thickness Reynolds number is defined as:\n$$Re_{\\theta} \\equiv \\frac{U_{\\infty}\\,\\theta}{\\nu}$$\nwhere $U_{\\infty}$ is the free-stream velocity and $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid.\n\nFor a Blasius laminar boundary layer, the momentum thickness $\\theta$ at a streamwise distance $x$ from the leading edge is given by:\n$$\\theta(x) = 0.664\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu\\,x}{U_{\\infty}}}$$\n\nTo find a relationship between $Re_{\\theta}$ and $x$, we substitute the expression for $\\theta(x)$ into the definition of $Re_{\\theta}$:\n$$Re_{\\theta} = \\frac{U_{\\infty}}{\\nu} \\left( 0.664\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu\\,x}{U_{\\infty}}} \\right)$$\n\nWe can simplify this expression by rearranging the terms:\n$$Re_{\\theta} = 0.664 \\cdot \\frac{U_{\\infty}}{\\nu} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\nu} \\cdot \\sqrt{x} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{U_{\\infty}}}$$\n$$Re_{\\theta} = 0.664 \\cdot \\frac{U_{\\infty}}{\\sqrt{U_{\\infty}}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{\\nu}}{\\nu} \\cdot \\sqrt{x}$$\n$$Re_{\\theta} = 0.664 \\cdot \\sqrt{U_{\\infty}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\nu}} \\cdot \\sqrt{x}$$\n$$Re_{\\theta} = 0.664 \\sqrt{\\frac{U_{\\infty}\\,x}{\\nu}}$$\n\nThe term under the square root is the definition of the local Reynolds number based on the streamwise distance, $Re_{x} \\equiv \\dfrac{U_{\\infty}\\,x}{\\nu}$.
