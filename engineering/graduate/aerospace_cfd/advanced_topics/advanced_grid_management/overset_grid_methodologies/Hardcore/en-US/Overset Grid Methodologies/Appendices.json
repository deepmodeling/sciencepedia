            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of numerical methods for computational fluid dynamics, is well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient information, and uses objective, formal language. We may proceed with a solution.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the derivation and application of trilinear interpolation weights for a hexahedral element. We begin from the first principle of one-dimensional linear interpolation.\n\nConsider a one-dimensional line segment defined by two nodes, indexed $i=0$ and $i=1$. We can define a local \"fractional\" coordinate $\\phi \\in [0,1]$ that spans this segment, such that $\\phi=0$ at node $0$ and $\\phi=1$ at node $1$. A value $f(\\phi)$ at any point along this segment can be interpolated from the nodal values $f_0$ and $f_1$ using a weighted average:\n$$ f(\\phi) = N_0(\\phi) f_0 + N_1(\\phi) f_1 $$\nwhere $N_0(\\phi)$ and $N_1(\\phi)$ are the linear basis functions, also known as shape functions. For the interpolation to be exact at the nodes, we must have $N_0(0)=1$, $N_0(1)=0$, $N_1(0)=0$, and $N_1(1)=1$. The unique linear polynomials satisfying these conditions are:\n$$ N_0(\\phi) = 1 - \\phi $$\n$$ N_1(\\phi) = \\phi $$\nA compact expression for these two shape functions, using the index $i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, is:\n$$ N_i(\\phi) = \\phi^i (1-\\phi)^{1-i} $$\n\nTo extend this to three dimensions for a hexahedral element, we employ the principle of tensor products. The hexahedron can be viewed as the tensor product of three one-dimensional line segments along three orthogonal logical axes. We define a set of fractional coordinates $(\\phi_x, \\phi_y, \\phi_z)$, each in the range $[0,1]$, corresponding to the logical directions. A vertex in this logical cube is identified by the triplet of indices $(i,j,k)$, where each index can be $0$ or $1$.\n\nThe interpolation weight $w_{ijk}$ assigned to the vertex $(i,j,k)$ for a target point at $(\\phi_x, \\phi_y, \\phi_z)$ is the product of the one-dimensional shape functions for each corresponding coordinate and index:\n$$ w_{ijk}(\\phi_x, \\phi_y, \\phi_z) = N_i(\\phi_x) N_j(\\phi_y) N_k(\\phi_z) $$\nSubstituting the compact expression for the 1D shape functions, we derive the general form of the vertex weight:\n$$ w_{ijk}(\\phi_x, \\phi_y, \\phi_z) = \\left( \\phi_x^i (1-\\phi_x)^{1-i} \\right) \\left( \\phi_y^j (1-\\phi_y)^{1-j} \\right) \\left( \\phi_z^k (1-\\phi_z)^{1-k} \\right) $$\nThis is the general expression for the interpolation weight at vertex $(i,j,k) \\in \\{0,1\\}^3$ as a function of the fractional coordinates $(\\phi_x, \\phi_y, \\phi_z)$.\n\nThe problem provides the local coordinates of the target point in the standard isoparametric coordinate system $(\\xi, \\eta, \\zeta)$, where each coordinate ranges from $-1$ to $1$. The fractional coordinates $\\phi_{\\alpha} \\in [0,1]$ (where $\\alpha \\in \\{x,y,z\\}$ corresponds to the logical directions associated with $\\xi, \\eta, \\zeta$ respectively) are obtained through a simple linear mapping. For a coordinate $\\chi \\in [-1,1]$, the corresponding fractional coordinate $\\phi \\in [0,1]$ is given by:\n$$ \\phi = \\frac{\\chi - (-1)}{1 - (-1)} = \\frac{\\chi+1}{2} $$\nTherefore, the relationships are:\n$$ \\phi_x = \\frac{\\xi+1}{2} $$\n$$ \\phi_y = \\frac{\\eta+1}{2} $$\n$$ \\phi_z = \\frac{\\zeta+1}{2} $$\n\nNow, we proceed to the specific calculation. The target point is given by $(\\xi, \\eta, \\zeta) = (0.3, -0.5, 0.8)$. First, we compute the corresponding fractional coordinates:\n$$ \\phi_x = \\frac{0.3 + 1}{2} = \\frac{1.3}{2} = 0.65 $$\n$$ \\phi_y = \\frac{-0.5 + 1}{2} = \\frac{0.5}{2} = 0.25 $$\n$$ \\phi_z = \\frac{0.8 + 1}{2} = \\frac{1.8}{2} = 0.9 $$\nThe target point in fractional coordinates is $(\\phi_x, \\phi_y, \\phi_z) = (0.65, 0.25, 0.9)$.\n\nWe need to compute the specific weight $w_{101}$ for the vertex indexed by $(i,j,k)=(1,0,1)$. Using the general formula for $w_{ijk}$ with these indices:\n$$ w_{101}(\\phi_x, \\phi_y, \\phi_z) = \\left( \\phi_x^1 (1-\\phi_x)^{1-1} \\right) \\left( \\phi_y^0 (1-\\phi_y)^{1-0} \\right) \\left( \\phi_z^1 (1-\\phi_z)^{1-1} \\right) $$\n$$ w_{101}(\\phi_x, \\phi_y, \\phi_z) = (\\phi_x) (1-\\phi_y) (\\phi_z) $$\nSubstituting the calculated fractional coordinates:\n$$ w_{101} = (0.65) \\times (1 - 0.25) \\times (0.9) $$\n$$ w_{101} = 0.65 \\times 0.75 \\times 0.9 $$\n$$ w_{101} = 0.4875 \\times 0.9 $$\n$$ w_{101} = 0.43875 $$\nThis value already has exactly five significant figures, so no further rounding is required.",

Consider a single smooth surface patch with local principal curvature magnitude $\\kappa$ at a point of interest. The CAD geometry provides pointwise evaluation with a certified geometric tolerance $\\epsilon$, meaning the returned surface points deviate from the true analytic surface by at most $\\epsilon$ in the Hausdorff sense.

            "solution": "The provided problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a standard geometric challenge in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) grid generation, specifically for overset (Chimera) grids. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe objective is to derive a minimal safety margin, $\\delta$, for hole cutting that robustly prevents the formation of \"sliver\" cells. These slivers arise from discrepancies between the true geometric surface and the simplified representation used for classifying grid cells. The problem identifies two primary sources of this discrepancy:\n1.  The inherent geometric tolerance of the Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model, denoted by $\\epsilon$.\n2.  The error introduced by approximating the curved surface with planar facets over a characteristic length scale $h$ of a background grid cell.\n\nA robust safety margin must account for the worst-case scenario where these two errors additively combine to cause a misclassification. The total discrepancy is a sum of the maximum possible deviations from each source. Let $\\delta_{\\epsilon}$ be the deviation from CAD tolerance and $\\delta_{\\text{curv}}$ be the deviation from the curvature-induced approximation. The total required margin is:\n$$\n\\delta = \\delta_{\\epsilon} + \\delta_{\\text{curv}}\n$$\n\nFirst, we consider the contribution from the CAD tolerance, $\\delta_{\\epsilon}$. The problem states that the CAD surface deviates from the true analytic surface by at most $\\epsilon$. In the worst case, the true surface can be shifted by a normal distance $\\epsilon$ from the CAD surface. Therefore, the margin required to account for this uncertainty is simply $\\epsilon$.\n$$\n\\delta_{\\epsilon} = \\epsilon\n$$\n\nNext, we quantify the curvature-induced deviation, $\\delta_{\\text{curv}}$. The problem instructs us to model the surface locally as its osculating circle, whose radius $R$ is the reciprocal of the local maximum principal curvature magnitude, $\\kappa$, so $R = 1/\\kappa$. The planar approximation is a chord of this circle with a length at most $h$. The maximum deviation between a circular arc and its chord is the sagitta of the circular segment. This deviation represents $\\delta_{\\text{curv}}$.\n\nTo calculate the sagitta, we use geometry. A right-angled triangle is formed by the radius $R$ (the hypotenuse), half the chord length $\\frac{h}{2}$ (one leg), and the distance from the circle's center to the chord, which is $R - \\delta_{\\text{curv}}$ (the other leg).
