## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The preceding chapters have established the fundamental principles and mechanisms of utilizing machine learning (ML) for turbulence and closure modeling. We have seen how ML can represent complex, nonlinear relationships and how physical constraints can be embedded to create robust models. This chapter transitions from principles to practice, exploring how these concepts are applied in diverse, real-world scientific and engineering domains. The objective is not to re-teach the core concepts but to demonstrate their utility, extension, and integration in a variety of interdisciplinary contexts. We will examine how ML-based turbulence modeling addresses specific challenges in fields ranging from aerospace engineering and combustion to Earth system science and fusion energy, highlighting the versatility and growing importance of this approach.

### Paradigms for Learning Turbulence Closures

Before delving into specific disciplines, it is instructive to survey the primary strategies, or paradigms, through which machine learning is integrated into turbulence modeling workflows. These paradigms represent different philosophical and practical approaches to leveraging data and computation.

#### Physics-Informed Data Generation

A foundational challenge in [supervised learning](@entry_id:161081) is the acquisition of high-fidelity training data. For turbulence [closures](@entry_id:747387), the "ground truth" is often the unclosed term itself, such as the Reynolds stress tensor. While Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) or Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) can provide this data, they are computationally expensive. A powerful alternative, and a cornerstone of physics-informed machine learning, is to use the governing equations to generate or constrain the training labels.

For instance, in many [canonical flows](@entry_id:188303), the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations simplify to a point where an exact analytical expression for the required Reynolds stress can be derived. In a statistically steady, fully developed plane channel flow, the mean streamwise momentum equation reduces to a simple balance between the pressure gradient and the divergence of the total shear stress (viscous plus turbulent). By integrating this equation and applying boundary conditions (no-slip at the wall and symmetry at the centerline), one can derive the exact Reynolds shear stress profile that the fluid must sustain to support the given pressure gradient. This provides a perfect, noise-free, and physically consistent target for training an ML model, ensuring that the learned closure respects the fundamental [momentum balance](@entry_id:1128118) of the system. This methodology allows for the generation of high-quality training data without necessarily running a full high-fidelity simulation for every case. 

#### Augmenting and Correcting Existing Models

Machine learning models do not need to replace entire physics-based [closures](@entry_id:747387). A highly effective and common strategy is to use ML to learn a *correction* or augmentation to an existing, well-established model. This hybrid approach leverages the robustness and known physical behavior of the baseline model while using the ML component to capture missing physics or correct for known deficiencies.

A prime example is the modeling of turbulent [scalar transport](@entry_id:150360), which is often based on the [gradient diffusion hypothesis](@entry_id:1125716). In this framework, the [turbulent scalar flux](@entry_id:1133523) is modeled as proportional to the mean scalar gradient, with the constant of proportionality being the turbulent diffusivity, $k_t$. This diffusivity is related to the eddy viscosity $\nu_t$ via the turbulent Prandtl number, $\mathrm{Pr}_t = \nu_t / k_t$. While often assumed to be a constant (e.g., $0.85$), $\mathrm{Pr}_t$ is known to vary with flow conditions. An ML model can be trained to predict a spatially varying, state-dependent correction to the baseline $\mathrm{Pr}_t$. The inputs to such a model are typically local, nondimensional flow features, such as the ratio of molecular to turbulent viscosity ($\nu/\nu_t$) or the dimensionless wall distance. The ML model learns a correction factor that modulates the baseline $\mathrm{Pr}_t$, leading to a more accurate prediction of the [turbulent scalar flux](@entry_id:1133523) while retaining the stable and physically intuitive structure of the original gradient diffusion model. 

#### Architectural Choices: Locality versus Non-locality

A critical decision in designing an ML closure is the choice of model architecture, which implicitly determines the physical assumptions of the model. The Reynolds stress at a point $\boldsymbol{x}$ is, in principle, a functional of the entire mean flow field, reflecting the non-local and history-dependent nature of turbulence.

A common approach, **pointwise regression**, learns a mapping from a vector of local features (e.g., invariants of the mean strain-rate and rotation-rate tensors at $\boldsymbol{x}$) to the Reynolds stress at that same point $\boldsymbol{x}$. This approach, while computationally efficient and easy to implement, imposes a strict locality assumption, analogous to classical algebraic eddy viscosity models.

A more powerful and physically general approach is **[operator learning](@entry_id:752958)**. This paradigm seeks to learn an operator that maps [entire functions](@entry_id:176232) to other functions—for example, mapping the entire [mean velocity](@entry_id:150038) field $\overline{\boldsymbol{u}}(\cdot)$ to the entire Reynolds stress field $\boldsymbol{\tau}(\cdot)$. Architectures such as Neural Operators are designed to capture these non-local dependencies, allowing the predicted stress at a point to be influenced by the flow state in a wider neighborhood, including far upstream. This is more faithful to the underlying physics, especially in flows with limited scale separation where the influence of large-scale structures is felt throughout the domain. While [operator learning](@entry_id:752958) is more complex, it offers a more powerful framework for capturing the true functional dependence of turbulent closures. Conversely, in the limit of large scale separation and local [isotropy](@entry_id:159159), the physics may become effectively local, making a pointwise approach a valid and efficient choice.  

### Interdisciplinary Applications and Connections

The principles of ML-based closure modeling find application across a vast array of scientific and engineering disciplines. We now explore several key areas, demonstrating the adaptability of these techniques to different physical regimes and challenges.

#### Aerospace Engineering and Compressible Flows

The design of aircraft and spacecraft relies heavily on the accurate prediction of turbulent flows, often in the compressible regime where density variations, shock waves, and high speeds are significant.

A fundamental consideration in compressible turbulence is the choice of averaging procedure. Standard Reynolds averaging leads to complex correlation terms involving density fluctuations (e.g., the turbulent mass flux, $\overline{\rho' u_i'}$). To simplify the structure of the mean-flow equations and maintain a form analogous to the incompressible equations, **Favre (density-weighted) averaging** is almost universally employed. For a quantity $\phi$, the Favre average is $\tilde{\phi} = \overline{\rho \phi} / \overline{\rho}$. This choice elegantly absorbs the turbulent mass flux into the definition of the mean velocity, resulting in a mean continuity equation, $\partial_t \overline{\rho} + \partial_i (\overline{\rho} \tilde{u_i}) = 0$, that retains a simple [conservative form](@entry_id:747710). This has direct implications for ML [closures](@entry_id:747387): to be consistent with the governing equations used in most compressible CFD solvers, ML models should be trained to predict Favre-averaged closure quantities (e.g., the Favre-averaged stress tensor $\overline{\rho u_i''u_j''}$) from inputs based on Favre-averaged mean fields. 

The concept of data-driven adaptation in turbulence models is not entirely new. The **dynamic Smagorinsky model** in LES, for instance, provides a historical precedent. It uses the Germano identity to dynamically compute the model coefficient from the resolved flow field at runtime, based on scale-similarity arguments. This allows the model to adapt to different [flow regimes](@entry_id:152820) and automatically switch off in laminar regions. This principle of using resolved flow information to determine closure parameters is a direct precursor to modern ML approaches, which can be seen as a significant generalization of this concept, learning much more complex and flexible adaptive functions. 

#### Combustion and Reacting Flows

Turbulent combustion is a multi-physics problem of immense complexity, where turbulence interacts strongly with chemical reactions. The extreme nonlinearity of chemical reaction rates, which depend exponentially on temperature, presents a formidable closure problem.

One key challenge is the closure for the **filtered or averaged chemical source terms**. Due to the nonlinearity, the averaged reaction rate is not equal to the reaction rate evaluated at the averaged temperature and species concentrations: $\tilde{\dot{\omega}}_\alpha \neq \dot{\omega}_\alpha(\tilde{Y}_\alpha, \tilde{T})$. This discrepancy arises from subgrid-scale fluctuations and their correlations. Advanced closure strategies, such as presumed Probability Density Function (PDF) methods, address this by integrating the instantaneous chemical rates over a presumed distribution of subgrid scalar values. Machine learning models offer a powerful way to implement or emulate these computationally expensive methods. For example, an ML model can be trained to learn the mapping from resolved moments of controlling scalars (like mixture fraction and its variance) directly to the filtered reaction rate, while being constrained to enforce physical laws like mass and element conservation. 

Even in the context of more traditional RANS modeling for [reacting flows](@entry_id:1130631), physical reasoning remains paramount. When modeling the turbulent heat flux, a decision must be made about the turbulent Prandtl number, $\mathrm{Pr}_t$. While one could attempt to learn a complex, state-dependent function for $\mathrm{Pr}_t$, a wealth of DNS evidence and modeling experience suggests that for many high-Reynolds-number flows, $\mathrm{Pr}_t$ is remarkably constant (e.g., $\approx 0.9$). A robust modeling strategy often involves using a constant $\mathrm{Pr}_t$ and modeling other complex physics, such as compressibility and heat release effects, through separate, explicit source terms in the governing equations. This avoids "double-counting" physical effects and leads to more generalizable models. This serves as a cautionary tale for ML applications: a judicious choice of what to learn and what to prescribe based on physical understanding is crucial. 

#### Earth System Science: Oceanography and Atmospheric Modeling

General Circulation Models (GCMs) for the atmosphere and ocean operate at resolutions far too coarse to resolve turbulent eddies, which play a critical role in transporting heat, salt, momentum, and other tracers. The representation of these unresolved processes, known as **[subgrid-scale parameterization](@entry_id:1132593)**, is a primary source of uncertainty in weather forecasts and climate projections.

Machine learning is emerging as a transformative tool for developing new parameterizations from high-resolution data. A sound strategy for developing such **hybrid physics-ML models** involves a careful partitioning of the system. The resolved-scale dynamics, which directly encode fundamental conservation laws, should be retained in their traditional, physics-based form. This ensures that the model rigorously conserves mass, momentum, and energy. The machine learning component is then tasked with learning the uncertain and complex subgrid tendencies. This approach leverages the strengths of both paradigms: the guaranteed physical consistency of the resolved solver and the [expressive power](@entry_id:149863) of ML to represent unresolved processes. The learned parameterization itself should still be constrained to respect known physical properties of the subgrid processes, such as conserving column-integrated budgets of certain quantities.  

Furthermore, any subgrid model, whether ML-based or not, must adhere to fundamental physical principles. In ocean modeling using the primitive equations, this includes ensuring that the closure model is **Galilean invariant** (its predictions do not depend on the observer's [constant velocity](@entry_id:170682)) and that it is **dissipative**. The net effect of subgrid turbulence is to cascade energy from larger, resolved scales to smaller, unresolved scales where it is dissipated. A closure model must reflect this by acting as a sink for resolved kinetic energy and scalar variance. This translates to mathematical constraints on the model, such as requiring eddy viscosity and eddy diffusivity coefficients to be non-negative. These constraints are essential for the numerical stability and physical realism of any learned closure. 

#### Fusion Science and Plasma Physics

The confinement of high-temperature plasma in fusion devices like tokamaks is governed by complex turbulent [transport processes](@entry_id:177992). Simulating these processes from first principles with [gyrokinetic codes](@entry_id:1125855) is extraordinarily expensive, making them unsuitable for routine design and analysis. Machine learning offers a path toward creating fast and accurate **reduced-order models** for these transport phenomena.

In this context, ML models, typically neural networks, are trained to emulate the results of high-fidelity [gyrokinetic simulations](@entry_id:1125863). The model learns the mapping from local, dimensionless plasma parameters (such as normalized temperature and density gradients, magnetic safety factor, and collisionality) to the resulting turbulent heat and particle fluxes. A key aspect of this approach is its grounding in physics. The input features are dimensionless parameters derived from plasma theory, which ensures the model respects fundamental scaling symmetries. The output is often structured to predict a dimensionless coefficient for a physics-based scaling law, such as the **gyro-Bohm scaling** for [turbulent diffusivity](@entry_id:196515), $\chi_i \propto v_{th,i} \rho_i^2 / L_T$. By building the model around a physically motivated structure and training it on first-principles data, one creates a physics-based surrogate that is far more reliable and generalizable than a purely empirical, black-box model. 

### Practical Implementation and Deployment

Beyond demonstrating efficacy in different domains, the successful application of ML [closures](@entry_id:747387) in critical engineering and scientific simulations requires robust implementation strategies, addressing training, integration, and safety.

#### Training and Optimization: Differentiable CFD

To train an ML closure that is deeply embedded within a CFD solver, it is often desirable to optimize it based on a system-level objective, such as minimizing the error in the predicted aerodynamic drag on an airfoil. This requires computing the gradient of the objective function with respect to the ML model's parameters (e.g., neural network weights). Since the flow solution itself depends on these parameters, this involves a complex chain of dependencies.

**Differentiable CFD** provides the tools for this task. The **adjoint method** is a highly efficient technique for computing these gradients. For a steady-state problem governed by a discrete residual system $F(U,\theta)=0$, the adjoint method allows for the computation of the gradient of an objective $J(U,\theta)$ with respect to a large number of parameters $\theta$ at a computational cost comparable to a single additional flow solve. This cost is independent of the number of parameters, making it ideal for training neural networks with thousands or millions of weights. A practical challenge is that many components of traditional CFD solvers (e.g., flux limiters) are non-differentiable. Making solvers fully differentiable often requires replacing these components with smooth approximations, enabling the stable backpropagation of gradients. 

#### Hybrid Modeling and Operational Safety

In many practical scenarios, ML models are not used in isolation but as part of a hybrid system that also includes traditional physics-based models. This is particularly true for [near-wall turbulence](@entry_id:194167), where the physics is well-understood and can be described by universal laws. A common hybrid strategy is **wall-modeled LES (WMLES)**, where the region near the wall is handled by a RANS model, and the region away from the wall is resolved by LES. An ML classifier can be used to create a smooth and intelligent blending function between these two regions, based on its assessment of the local flow's resolvability. This allows the model to dynamically allocate resources, relying on the robust RANS model where needed and leveraging the higher fidelity of LES elsewhere. 

Finally, the deployment of any ML model in a safety-critical application demands a policy for handling situations where the model is forced to extrapolate beyond the data on which it was trained. An ML closure is only reliable within its training distribution. An essential safety mechanism is **out-of-distribution (OOD) detection**. By modeling the distribution of the training data's feature vectors (e.g., as a multivariate Gaussian), one can compute a statistical measure of novelty for any new [feature vector](@entry_id:920515) encountered during a simulation. The **Mahalanobis distance** is one such metric. If this distance exceeds a predefined threshold, it indicates that the model is operating in an unfamiliar regime. In such cases, a safety protocol should be triggered, which typically involves reverting to a trusted, robust baseline closure model (e.g., a standard RANS model). This ensures that the overall simulation remains stable and physically plausible, even when the ML component encounters unforeseen conditions. 

### Conclusion

This chapter has journeyed through a wide landscape of applications for machine learning in turbulence and closure modeling. From the foundational paradigms of data generation and model architecture to specific challenges in aerospace, combustion, earth science, and fusion, a clear picture emerges. Machine learning is not a replacement for physical understanding, but rather a powerful amplifier for it.

The most successful applications are those that are deeply "physics-informed"—where ML models are constrained by fundamental laws, trained on physically consistent data, and integrated into hybrid frameworks that respect the well-established principles of fluid dynamics. As we have seen, the recurring themes are the enforcement of conservation laws and symmetries, the judicious partitioning of what to learn versus what to prescribe, and the critical importance of safety and robustness in deployment. By embracing this synergy between data-driven methods and first-principles physics, researchers and engineers are poised to overcome long-standing challenges in turbulence modeling and unlock new frontiers of scientific discovery and technological innovation.
