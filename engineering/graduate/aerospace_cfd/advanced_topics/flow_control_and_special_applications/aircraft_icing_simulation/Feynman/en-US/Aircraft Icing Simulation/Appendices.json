            "problem": "You are to implement a two-dimensional particle tracking simulation consistent with aircraft icing analysis at advanced graduate level, beginning from first principles of mechanics and potential flow. The objective is to compute the surface mass flux $m''(s)$ along the leading edge of a NACA $0012$ airfoil approximated locally as a circular cylinder, for an inlet particle size distribution following a lognormal law and a freestream speed $U_\\infty = 70\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$. The output must be expressed in $\\mathrm{kg/(m^2\\,s)}$ and angles must be treated in radians.\n\nModel and assumptions:\n\n- Geometry: Consider a NACA $0012$ with chord $c = 1\\,\\mathrm{m}$ and thickness ratio $t = 0.12$. Approximate the leading edge by a circular cylinder of radius $R = r_{\\mathrm{LE}}$, where $r_{\\mathrm{LE}} = 1.1019\\,t^2\\,c$. Place the cylinder center at the origin in the $xy$-plane. The surface arc length coordinate $s$ is measured from the stagnation point at $\\theta = 0$ (front center) along either upper or lower surface, using $s = R\\,|\\theta|$ for $|\\theta| \\le \\pi/2$.\n\n- Flow field: Assume steady, incompressible, inviscid potential flow around a circular cylinder in uniform freestream. Using complex analysis, the complex potential derivative is $dw/dz = U_\\infty\\left(1 - \\frac{R^2}{z^2}\\right)$ with $z = x + i y$. Interpreting $dw/dz = u - i v$, the local flow velocity is $u(x,y) = \\Re\\left(U_\\infty\\left(1 - \\frac{R^2}{(x+i y)^2}\\right)\\right)$, $v(x,y) = -\\Im\\left(U_\\infty\\left(1 - \\frac{R^2}{(x+i y)^2}\\right)\\right)$.\n\n- Particle dynamics: Model droplets as point particles obeying Newton’s second law with Stokes drag in the air, neglecting gravity, buoyancy, and added mass. For a droplet of diameter $d$, density $\\rho_w$, and dynamic viscosity of air $\\mu$, the relaxation time is $\\tau_p = \\frac{\\rho_w\\,d^2}{18\\,\\mu}$. With local flow velocity components $u(x,y)$ and $v(x,y)$, the particle equations of motion are\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = v_x,\\quad \\frac{dy}{dt} = v_y,\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dv_x}{dt} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_p}\\left(u(x,y) - v_x\\right),\\quad \\frac{dv_y}{dt} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_p}\\left(v(x,y) - v_y\\right).\n$$\nA particle is considered to impact the surface when its radial distance $r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ satisfies $r \\le R$. The impact location on the cylinder is characterized by $\\theta = \\mathrm{atan2}(y,x)$ and $s = R\\,|\\theta|$. Only impacts on the front half $|\\theta| \\le \\pi/2$ are accumulated.\n\n- Inlet particle size distribution: Assume an inlet lognormal distribution of diameters $d$ with median diameter $d_m$ and geometric standard deviation $\\sigma_g$. That is, $\\ln d \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\ln d_m,\\, \\ln^2 \\sigma_g\\right)$. Use Monte Carlo sampling to draw $N_p$ independent droplets per case.\n\n- Liquid water content and mass flux normalization: Let the Liquid Water Content (LWC) be $\\mathrm{kg/m^3}$. Consider an inlet plane at $x = -5R$ spanning $y \\in [-3R, 3R]$ per unit span in the $z$-direction. The physical area of this inlet plane is $A_{\\text{in}} = 6R \\times 1\\,\\mathrm{m^2}$. The total water mass flux crossing the inlet per unit span is $F_{\\text{in}} = \\mathrm{LWC}\\times U_\\infty \\times A_{\\text{in}}$ in $\\mathrm{kg/s}$. For each sampled droplet of diameter $d_i$, assign its physical mass $m_i = \\rho_w \\frac{\\pi}{6} d_i^3$ and define its contribution weight $w_i = m_i\\left/F_{\\text{tot}}\\right.\\times F_{\\text{in}}$ where $F_{\\text{tot}} = \\sum_{j=1}^{N_p} m_j$. This makes $\\sum_i w_i = F_{\\text{in}}$ and interprets the simulation as representing a unit time.\n\n- Surface mass flux accumulation: Discretize the front half arc length $s \\in [0, R\\,\\pi/2]$ into $M$ equal bins. For each impacting particle, compute the bin index from its $s$ and add its weight $w_i$ to that bin’s tally. The surface mass flux density in bin $k$ is then $m''_k = \\frac{W_k}{\\Delta s}$ where $W_k$ is the sum of weights that impacted in bin $k$ and $\\Delta s = \\frac{R\\,\\pi/2}{M}$ is the bin width. The units are $\\mathrm{kg/(m^2\\,s)}$.\n\nAlgorithmic requirements:\n\n- Use an explicit time-marching scheme with fixed time step for integrating the particle ordinary differential equations above. Initialize each particle at $x_0 = -5R$ with $y_0$ uniformly sampled from $[-3R, 3R]$ and initial velocity $(v_{x0}, v_{y0}) = (U_\\infty, 0)$. Terminate integration for a particle when it impacts ($r \\le R$), exits the computational box ($x \\ge 5R$ or $|y| \\ge 5R$), or exceeds a maximum integration time. Use a robust interpolation if a step crosses the surface to estimate the impact location.\n\n- Angles must be in radians. The final output surface mass flux density must be expressed in $\\mathrm{kg/(m^2\\,s)}$.\n\nTest suite:\n\nImplement your program to run the following three scientifically distinct cases that explore typical aircraft icing regimes:\n\n- Case $1$ (general mixed droplets): $U_\\infty = 70\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, $c = 1\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $t = 0.12$, $\\rho_w = 1000\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^3}$, $\\mu = 1.8\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{kg/(m\\,s)}$, $\\mathrm{LWC} = 5.0\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^3}$, $d_m = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, $\\sigma_g = 1.5$, $N_p = 2000$, $M = 12$, time step $\\Delta t = 2.0\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{s}$, maximum integration time $t_{\\max} = 5.0\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\n- Case $2$ (small droplets near Stokes regime): $U_\\infty = 70\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, $c = 1\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $t = 0.12$, $\\rho_w = 1000\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^3}$, $\\mu = 1.8\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{kg/(m\\,s)}$, $\\mathrm{LWC} = 2.0\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^3}$, $d_m = 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, $\\sigma_g = 1.3$, $N_p = 2000$, $M = 12$, time step $\\Delta t = 2.0\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{s}$, maximum integration time $t_{\\max} = 5.0\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\n- Case $3$ (large droplets with higher inertia): $U_\\infty = 70\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, $c = 1\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $t = 0.12$, $\\rho_w = 1000\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^3}$, $\\mu = 1.8\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{kg/(m\\,s)}$, $\\mathrm{LWC} = 1.2\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^3}$, $d_m = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, $\\sigma_g = 1.8$, $N_p = 2000$, $M = 12$, time step $\\Delta t = 2.0\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{s}$, maximum integration time $t_{\\max} = 5.0\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nFinal output format:\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each test case result is itself a list of $M$ floats representing $m''(s)$ bin values from $s = 0$ to $s = R\\,\\pi/2$ in $\\mathrm{kg/(m^2\\,s)}$. For example, the printed line must look like $[[m''_1,\\dots,m''_{12}],[m''_1,\\dots,m''_{12}],[m''_1,\\dots,m''_{12}]]$ with no additional text.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the implementation of a two-dimensional Lagrangian particle tracking simulation to compute the surface mass flux of supercooled water droplets impinging on the leading edge of a NACA 0012 airfoil. The airfoil's leading edge is approximated as a circular cylinder. The solution involves a synthesis of potential flow theory, classical mechanics, statistical methods, and numerical integration.\n\n### 1. Geometric and Fluid Dynamic Model\n\nThe initial step is to define the geometry and the surrounding flow field.\n\n**Geometry:** The leading edge of a NACA 0012 airfoil with chord $c = 1\\,\\mathrm{m}$ and thickness ratio $t = 0.12$ is modeled as a circular cylinder. The radius of this cylinder, $R$, is given by the standard empirical relation for the leading edge radius of curvature, $r_{\\mathrm{LE}}$:\n$$\nR = r_{\\mathrm{LE}} = 1.1019\\,t^2\\,c\n$$\nFor $t = 0.12$ and $c = 1\\,\\mathrm{m}$, the radius is:\n$$\nR = 1.1019 \\times (0.12)^2 \\times 1 = 1.1019 \\times 0.0144 \\approx 0.015867\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe cylinder is centered at the origin $(0,0)$ of a Cartesian coordinate system. The surface arc length, $s$, is measured from the forward stagnation point $(\\theta=0)$ along the cylinder's surface, defined as $s = R\\,|\\theta|$ for the front-facing portion $|\\theta| \\le \\pi/2$.\n\n**Flow Field:** The airflow around the cylinder is modeled as steady, incompressible, and inviscid potential flow. The velocity field is derived from the complex potential, $w(z)$, where $z = x + iy$. The derivative of the complex potential for uniform flow with speed $U_\\infty$ past a cylinder of radius $R$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dw}{dz} = U_\\infty\\left(1 - \\frac{R^2}{z^2}\\right)\n$$\nThe local fluid velocity vector $(u, v)$ is related to the complex velocity by $dw/dz = u - iv$. Therefore, we can extract the velocity components:\n$$\nu(x,y) = \\Re\\left(\\frac{dw}{dz}\\right) = \\Re\\left( U_\\infty\\left(1 - \\frac{R^2}{(x+iy)^2}\\right) \\right)\n$$\n$$\nv(x,y) = -\\Im\\left(\\frac{dw}{dz}\\right) = -\\Im\\left( U_\\infty\\left(1 - \\frac{R^2}{(x+iy)^2}\\right) \\right)\n$$\nExpanding the complex term $\\frac{R^2}{z^2} = \\frac{R^2(x-iy)^2}{(x^2+y^2)^2} = \\frac{R^2(x^2 - y^2 - 2ixy)}{(x^2+y^2)^2}$, we obtain the explicit expressions for the velocity components:\n$$\nu(x,y) = U_\\infty \\left(1 - \\frac{R^2(x^2 - y^2)}{(x^2+y^2)^2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nv(x,y) = -U_\\infty \\frac{2R^2xy}{(x^2+y^2)^2}\n$$\nThese equations define the velocity of the air at any point $(x,y)$ outside the cylinder.\n\n### 2. Particle Dynamics and Statistical Model\n\nThe motion of water droplets within this flow field is governed by Newton's second law, assuming the dominant force is Stokes drag.\n\n**Equation of Motion:** A droplet is treated as a point mass. Forces such as gravity, buoyancy, and added mass are neglected. The equation of motion for a particle with velocity $(v_x, v_y)$ in a fluid with velocity $(u, v)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\vec{v}_p}{dt} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_p}(\\vec{u}_{\\text{fluid}} - \\vec{v}_p)\n$$\nHere, $\\tau_p$ is the particle relaxation time, which characterizes the particle's inertial response to changes in the fluid velocity. For a spherical particle of diameter $d$ and density $\\rho_w$ in a fluid with dynamic viscosity $\\mu$, it is defined as:\n$$\n\\tau_p = \\frac{\\rho_w\\,d^2}{18\\,\\mu}\n$$\nThe complete system of first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the particle's position $(x, y)$ and velocity $(v_x, v_y)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = v_x, \\quad \\frac{dy}{dt} = v_y\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dv_x}{dt} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_p}\\left(u(x,y) - v_x\\right), \\quad \\frac{dv_y}{dt} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_p}\\left(v(x,y) - v_y\\right)\n$$\nThe behavior of a particle is largely determined by its inertia, encapsulated by $\\tau_p$. Small droplets (small $\\tau_p$) tend to follow the fluid streamlines, while large droplets (large $\\tau_p$) are less affected by streamline curvature and tend to travel in straighter lines.\n\n**Particle Size Distribution:** The simulation employs a Monte Carlo method where $N_p$ individual particles are tracked. The diameters of these particles are not uniform but are sampled from a lognormal distribution. This distribution is defined by a median diameter $d_m$ and a geometric standard deviation $\\sigma_g$. Specifically, the natural logarithm of the diameter, $\\ln d$, follows a normal distribution with mean $\\mu = \\ln d_m$ and standard deviation $\\sigma = \\ln \\sigma_g$:\n$$\n\\ln d \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\ln d_m, (\\ln \\sigma_g)^2\\right)\n$$\nFor each of the $N_p$ computational particles, a diameter $d_i$ is drawn from this distribution.\n\n### 3. Numerical Algorithm and Mass Flux Calculation\n\nThe continuous physics model is discretized to enable a numerical solution.\n\n**Particle Trajectory Integration:** The system of ODEs is solved numerically using an explicit time-marching scheme with a fixed time step $\\Delta t$. We use the Explicit Euler method. For a particle at state $(x_n, y_n, v_{x,n}, v_{y,n})$ at time $t_n$:\n1.  Evaluate fluid velocity $u_n = u(x_n, y_n)$ and $v_n = v(x_n, y_n)$.\n2.  Update particle velocity:\n    $v_{x,n+1} = v_{x,n} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_p}(u_n - v_{x,n})\\Delta t$\n    $v_{y,n+1} = v_{y,n} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_p}(v_n - v_{y,n})\\Delta t$\n3.  Update particle position:\n    $x_{n+1} = x_n + v_{x,n}\\Delta t$\n    $y_{n+1} = y_n + v_{y,n}\\Delta t$\nEach particle is initialized at $x_0 = -5R$ with a vertical position $y_0$ sampled uniformly from $[-3R, 3R]$. The initial velocity is set to the freestream velocity, $(v_{x0}, v_{y0}) = (U_\\infty, 0)$. Integration for a particle terminates if it impacts the cylinder, exits the computational domain ($x \\ge 5R$ or $|y| \\ge 5R$), or exceeds the maximum integration time $t_{\\max}$.\n\n**Impact Detection:** An impact occurs when the particle's radial position $r = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ becomes less than or equal to $R$. Since the discrete time step $\\Delta t$ is finite, a particle can jump from a position outside the cylinder, $\\vec{p}_n$, to one inside, $\\vec{p}_{n+1}$. To find the precise impact location, we interpolate along the straight line segment between these two points. We solve for the parameter $s_{int} \\in [0,1]$ such that the point $\\vec{p}_{impact} = \\vec{p}_n + s_{int}(\\vec{p}_{n+1} - \\vec{p}_n)$ satisfies $|\\vec{p}_{impact}|^2 = R^2$. This leads to a quadratic equation for $s_{int}$, from which the correct root is chosen to find the impact coordinates $(x_{impact}, y_{impact})$. The impact angle is then $\\theta_{impact} = \\mathrm{atan2}(y_{impact}, x_{impact})$.\n\n**Mass Flux Calculation:** The simulation with a finite number of particles $N_p$ must be scaled to represent the continuous physical mass flux.\n1.  The physical mass flux entering the domain per unit span is $F_{\\text{in}} = \\mathrm{LWC} \\times U_\\infty \\times A_{\\text{in}}$, where $A_{\\text{in}} = (6R \\times 1\\,\\mathrm{m})$ is the inlet area. Its units are $\\mathrm{kg/s}$.\n2.  For each sampled particle $i$ with diameter $d_i$, its physical mass is $m_i = \\rho_w \\frac{\\pi}{6} d_i^3$.\n3.  The total mass of all $N_p$ sampled particles is $M_{sampled} = \\sum_{j=1}^{N_p} m_j$.\n4.  Each computational particle $i$ is assigned a weight, $w_i$, which represents the mass flow rate it carries:\n    $$\n    w_i = \\frac{m_i}{M_{sampled}} \\times F_{\\text{in}}\n    $$\n    The sum of all weights $\\sum_i w_i$ is equal to the total incoming mass flux $F_{\\text{in}}$.\n5.  The front surface of the cylinder, corresponding to the arc length from $s=0$ to $s=R\\pi/2$, is divided into $M$ equal-sized bins. The width of each bin is $\\Delta s = \\frac{R\\pi/2}{M}$.\n6.  When a particle impacts the front surface ($|\\theta_{impact}| \\le \\pi/2$), its arc length $s_{impact} = R|\\theta_{impact}|$ is calculated. The corresponding bin index is $k = \\lfloor s_{impact} / \\Delta s \\rfloor$. The particle's weight $w_i$ is added to the total weight collected in that bin, $W_k$.\n7.  Finally, the surface mass flux density for each bin $k$ is computed by dividing the collected mass rate by the bin's surface area (per unit span). The area is $\\Delta A_k = \\Delta s \\times 1\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n    $$\n    m''_k = \\frac{W_k}{\\Delta s} \\quad [\\mathrm{kg/(m^2s)}]\n    $$\nThis procedure yields a histogram of the mass flux distribution along the airfoil's leading edge. The three test cases explore how this distribution changes with different droplet statistics (median diameter and spread), which directly affects particle inertia and therefore the impingement pattern.",

Let $s$ denote the surface arc-length coordinate (in $\\mathrm{m}$) measured from the leading-edge stagnation point along the upper surface. The impinging water field is described by a known impingement efficiency distribution $\\beta(s)$ that maps the free-stream volumetric liquid water into local surface mass flux. The free-stream liquid water content (LWC) is uniform in space and constant in time. The free-stream speed is $U_{\\infty}$ (in $\\mathrm{m/s}$), the accretion duration is $t$ (in $\\mathrm{s}$), the ice density is $\\rho_{i}$ (in $\\mathrm{kg/m^3}$), and the glaze growth is taken to be normal to the surface. A local runoff fraction $r(s)$ (dimensionless) removes a portion of the impinging water immediately; the remaining portion may freeze with a position-dependent freezing propensity $\\phi(s)$ (dimensionless). Assume that the aerodynamic impingement efficiency $\\beta(s)$, the freezing propensity $\\phi(s)$, and the runoff fraction $r(s)$ are time-independent and do not change with the evolving ice shape over the specified duration. Neglect all heat transfer feedbacks, curvature effects, and film advection; specifically, treat the freezing as an instantaneous local sink on the retained liquid water fraction and assume the accretion is dilute enough that $\\beta(s)$ remains fixed.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. A solution can be derived and implemented.\n\n### Derivation and Solution Methodology\n\nThe derivation begins from the principle of conservation of mass for the liquid water accreting on the airfoil surface.\n\n1.  **Mass Flux of Water in the Freestream:** The Liquid Water Content, $\\text{LWC}$, is defined as the mass of water per unit volume of air. An air parcel moving at the freestream velocity $U_{\\infty}$ transports water. The mass of water crossing a unit area ($1\\,\\mathrm{m^2}$) normal to the flow per unit time is the freestream mass flux, $\\dot{m}''_{\\text{stream}}$:\n    $$\n    \\dot{m}''_{\\text{stream}} = \\text{LWC} \\cdot U_{\\infty}\n    $$\n    The units are $(\\mathrm{kg/m^3}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{m/s}) = \\mathrm{kg/(s \\cdot m^2)}$, which is correctly a mass flux.\n\n2.  **Impinging Mass Flux:** The local impingement efficiency, $\\beta(s)$, is the fraction of the freestream water that strikes the surface at arc-length coordinate $s$. The local mass flux of impinging water, $\\dot{m}''_{\\text{impinge}}(s)$, is therefore:\n    $$\n    \\dot{m}''_{\\text{impinge}}(s) = \\beta(s) \\cdot \\dot{m}''_{\\text{stream}} = \\beta(s) \\cdot \\text{LWC} \\cdot U_{\\infty}\n    $$\n\n3.  **Retained Mass Flux:** A portion of the impinging water, given by the runoff fraction $r(s)$, is immediately removed and does not participate in the freezing process. The fraction of water that remains on the surface is $(1 - r(s))$. The mass flux of this retained water, $\\dot{m}''_{\\text{retained}}(s)$, is:\n    $$\n    \\dot{m}''_{\\text{retained}}(s) = (1 - r(s)) \\cdot \\dot{m}''_{\\text{impinge}}(s) = (1 - r(s)) \\cdot \\beta(s) \\cdot \\text{LWC} \\cdot U_{\\infty}\n    $$\n\n4.  **Freezing Mass Flux:** The freezing propensity, $\\phi(s)$, is the fraction of the *retained* water that freezes into ice. The mass flux of water turning into solid ice, $\\dot{m}''_{\\text{ice}}(s)$, is:\n    $$\n    \\dot{m}''_{\\text{ice}}(s) = \\phi(s) \\cdot \\dot{m}''_{\\text{retained}}(s) = \\phi(s) \\cdot (1 - r(s)) \\cdot \\beta(s) \\cdot \\text{LWC} \\cdot U_{\\infty}\n    $$\n\n5.  **Ice Thickness Growth Rate:** The problem states that ice grows normal to the surface with a thickness $h(s)$ and constant density $\\rho_i$. The accumulation of ice mass per unit area per unit time must equal the freezing mass flux. For a differential thickness $dh$ added over a time $dt$, the mass added per unit area is $\\rho_i \\cdot dh$. The rate of mass addition per unit area is thus $\\rho_i \\cdot (dh/dt)$. Equating this with the freezing mass flux gives the local ice thickness growth rate:\n    $$\n    \\rho_i \\frac{dh}{dt}(s) = \\dot{m}''_{\\text{ice}}(s)\n    $$\n    Solving for the growth rate $\\frac{dh}{dt}(s)$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{dh}{dt}(s) = \\frac{1}{\\rho_i} \\dot{m}''_{\\text{ice}}(s) = \\frac{\\text{LWC} \\cdot U_{\\infty}}{\\rho_i} \\cdot \\beta(s) \\cdot (1 - r(s)) \\cdot \\phi(s)\n    $$\n\n6.  **Total Ice Thickness:** The problem specifies that all coefficients are constant over the accretion duration $t$. To find the total ice thickness $h(s)$ after time $t$, we integrate the growth rate from time $0$ to $t$:\n    $$\n    h(s) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{dh}{dt}(s) \\,d\\tau = \\frac{dh}{dt}(s) \\cdot t\n    $$\n    Substituting the expression for the growth rate, we obtain the final expression for the local ice thickness:\n    $$\n    h(s) = \\frac{\\text{LWC} \\cdot U_{\\infty} \\cdot t}{\\rho_i} \\cdot \\beta(s) \\cdot (1 - r(s)) \\cdot \\phi(s)\n    $$\n\n7.  **Numerical Implementation:**\n    -   The surface arc-length domain $s \\in [0, S_{\\max}]$ is discretized into $N=1001$ equally spaced points.\n    -   For each point $s_j$ in the discretized domain, the functions $\\beta(s_j)$, $\\phi(s_j)$, and $r(s_j)$ are calculated using the given parametric formulas.\n    -   As per the problem statement, the computed values of these three functions are clamped to the physical range $[0, 1]$.\n    -   The ice thickness $h(s_j)$ is computed for all points using the derived formula.\n    -   The \"horn height\" is the maximum value in the resulting $h(s)$ array. This value, originally in meters, is converted to millimeters by multiplying by $1000$.\n    -   The \"horn location\" is the smallest value of $s$ where this maximum occurs. This is found by determining the index of the first occurrence of the maximum value in the $h(s)$ array and retrieving the corresponding value from the $s$ array.\n    -   For the case where $h(s) \\equiv 0$ (e.g., if $\\text{LWC}=0$), the horn height and location are both defined as $0.0$.\n    -   Both the final horn height (in $\\mathrm{mm}$) and horn location (in $\\mathrm{m}$) are rounded to $6$ decimal places.",
