            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. The definitions and context are consistent with established principles in computational fluid dynamics and Fourier analysis. No flaws were detected during the validation process. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe objective is to determine the total number of real-valued degrees of freedom in a computational model that uses the Harmonic Balance (HB) method to represent a time-periodic flow.\n\nLet $u(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ represent one of the $m$ conserved variables at a specific spatial location $\\mathbf{x}$. Since the flow is time-periodic with a fundamental angular frequency $\\omega$, the function $u(t)$ (for a fixed $\\mathbf{x}$) can be represented by a Fourier series. The problem specifies that the variables are real-valued, so we use the real form of the Fourier series. For a period $T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}$, the full series is:\n$$\nu(t) = a_0 + \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\left[ a_k \\cos(k\\omega t) + b_k \\sin(k\\omega t) \\right]\n$$\nHere, $a_0$, $a_k$, and $b_k$ are the real-valued Fourier coefficients.\n\nThe HB method employs a truncated version of this series. The problem states that the truncation retains $N$ harmonics beyond the zero-frequency component.\nThe zero-frequency component is the time-averaged or mean value, represented by the single coefficient $a_0$. This constitutes $1$ degree of freedom.\nThe harmonics correspond to frequencies $k\\omega$ for $k=1, 2, 3, \\dots$. Retaining $N$ harmonics means we consider the terms for $k=1, 2, \\dots, N$.\nFor each harmonic index $k$, where $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$, the representation requires two real coefficients: $a_k$ for the cosine basis function $\\cos(k\\omega t)$ and $b_k$ for the sine basis function $\\sin(k\\omega t)$. The set of basis functions $\\{1, \\cos(\\omega t), \\sin(\\omega t), \\cos(2\\omega t), \\sin(2\\omega t), \\dots\\}$ is orthogonal and therefore linearly independent over the interval $[0, T]$. Thus, the coefficients are unique and independent.\n\nLet us count the number of real-valued coefficients for a single conserved variable at a single spatial location.\n1.  The zero-frequency (mean) component requires $1$ coefficient ($a_0$).\n2.  There are $N$ harmonics, with the index $k$ running from $1$ to $N$.\n3.  Each of these $N$ harmonics requires $2$ coefficients ($a_k$ and $b_k$).\n4.  The total number of coefficients for the $N$ harmonics is therefore $2 \\times N = 2N$.\n\nThe total number of degrees of freedom (DoF) for a single real-valued, time-periodic variable at a single spatial location, which we denote as $D_{\\text{var}}$, is the sum of the degrees of freedom from the mean component and the harmonic components: $D_{\\text{var}} = 1 + 2N$. This expression represents the number of independent real values needed to define the temporal behavior of one conserved variable at one point in the discretized space.\n\nThe problem specifies that the physical system is described by $m$ conserved variables at each spatial location. These variables (e.g., density, momentum components, energy) are, in general, independent of each other. Therefore, the total number of degrees of freedom per spatial location is the product of the number of variables and the degrees of freedom per variable: $D_{\\text{spatial}} = m \\times D_{\\text{var}} = m(2N+1)$.\n\nFinally, the spatial domain is discretized, resulting in $N_s$ independent spatial unknowns. These unknowns could be values at nodes of a grid, a cell-averaged value in a control volume, or coefficients of spatial basis functions. The temporal Fourier expansion is applied to each of these $N_s$ spatial degrees of freedom. The total number of real-valued degrees of freedom for the entire system, which we denote as $D_{\\text{total}}$, is the product of the degrees of freedom per spatial unknown and the total number of spatial unknowns: $D_{\\text{total}} = N_s \\times D_{\\text{spatial}} = N_s \\times m(2N+1)$.\nRearranging for convention, the final expression for the total number of real-valued degrees of freedom is $D_{\\text{total}} = m N_s (2N+1)$. This expression is a closed-form analytic expression in terms of the given parameters $N$, $m$, and $N_s$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the fundamental angular frequency, $\\omega_0$, for a Harmonic Balance (HB) simulation of a single-stage turbomachine, and its subsequent numerical calculation for a specific case. The derivation must be based on first principles of periodicity in a rotor-stator system.\n\nThe core principle for a consistent HB formulation is that the flow field must be temporally periodic. In a turbomachine with a rotor and a stator having unequal blade/vane counts, this periodicity is not determined by a single blade-passing event, but by the time it takes for the entire geometric configuration of the rotor relative to the stator to repeat.\n\nLet the rotor have $Z_r$ identical and equally spaced blades, and the stator have $Z_s$ identical and equally spaced vanes. The angular pitch of the rotor blades is $\\Delta\\theta_r = \\frac{2\\pi}{Z_r}$, and the angular pitch of the stator vanes is $\\Delta\\theta_s = \\frac{2\\pi}{Z_s}$. The rotor spins at a constant angular speed $\\Omega$, so its angular position at time $t$ is given by $\\theta(t) = \\Omega t$, assuming $\\theta(0)=0$.\n\nThe combined rotor-stator system is said to have returned to a geometrically equivalent configuration after a time $T$ if, after rotating by an angle $\\theta(T) = \\Omega T$, the rotor blades are positioned relative to the stator vanes in a manner physically indistinguishable from the initial state at $t=0$. This is the condition of integer pitch invariance. This occurs when the angle of rotation, $\\theta(T)$, is simultaneously an integer multiple of the rotor's pitch and an integer multiple of the stator's pitch.\n\nMathematically, we seek the smallest positive time $T$, which we denote $T_{\\mathrm{LCM}}$, such that the angle of rotation $\\theta(T_{\\mathrm{LCM}}) = \\Omega T_{\\mathrm{LCM}}$ satisfies:\n$$ \\Omega T_{\\mathrm{LCM}} = k_r \\Delta\\theta_r = k_s \\Delta\\theta_s $$\nfor some positive integers $k_r$ and $k_s$. Substituting the expressions for the pitch angles, we have:\n$$ \\Omega T_{\\mathrm{LCM}} = k_r \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{Z_r}\\right) = k_s \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{Z_s}\\right) $$\nWe can simplify this by dividing by $2\\pi$:\n$$ \\frac{k_r}{Z_r} = \\frac{k_s}{Z_s} $$\nWe are looking for the smallest positive integers $k_r$ and $k_s$ that satisfy this relation. Let $g = \\text{gcd}(Z_r, Z_s)$ be the greatest common divisor of the blade and vane counts. We can write $Z_r = g \\cdot z'_r$ and $Z_s = g \\cdot z'_s$, where $z'_r$ and $z'_s$ are coprime integers. Substituting these into the relation gives:\n$$ \\frac{k_r}{g \\cdot z'_r} = \\frac{k_s}{g \\cdot z'_s} \\implies k_r z'_s = k_s z'_r $$\nSince $z'_r$ and $z'_s$ are coprime, the smallest positive integer solution for this equation is $k_r = z'_r$ and $k_s = z'_s$. Substituting back the definitions of $z'_r$ and $z'_s$:\n$$ k_r = \\frac{Z_r}{\\text{gcd}(Z_r, Z_s)} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad k_s = \\frac{Z_s}{\\text{gcd}(Z_r, Z_s)} $$\nThese are the minimum integer numbers of rotor and stator pitches, respectively, that must be traversed to regain geometric congruency.\n\nThe minimum angle of rotation, $\\theta_{\\text{min}}$, required for this periodicity is found by substituting $k_r$ back into the angle equation:\n$$ \\theta_{\\text{min}} = k_r \\Delta\\theta_r = \\left( \\frac{Z_r}{\\text{gcd}(Z_r, Z_s)} \\right) \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{Z_r} \\right) = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\text{gcd}(Z_r, Z_s)} $$\nThe smallest positive common period, $T_{\\mathrm{LCM}}$, is the time required for the rotor to turn by this angle $\\theta_{\\text{min}}$ at speed $\\Omega$:\n$$ \\Omega T_{\\mathrm{LCM}} = \\theta_{\\text{min}} \\implies T_{\\mathrm{LCM}} = \\frac{\\theta_{\\text{min}}}{\\Omega} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\Omega \\cdot \\text{gcd}(Z_r, Z_s)} $$\nThis period $T_{\\mathrm{LCM}}$ is the fundamental period of the coupled aero-acoustic field. The Harmonic Balance method expands the flow solution in a Fourier series in time. For this series to represent all physical interactions, its fundamental angular frequency, $\\omega_0$, must correspond to this longest period $T_{\\mathrm{LCM}}$. The relationship between angular frequency and period is $\\omega_0 = \\frac{2\\pi}{T}$.\nTherefore, the HB fundamental angular frequency is:\n$$ \\omega_0 = \\frac{2\\pi}{T_{\\mathrm{LCM}}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{\\Omega \\cdot \\text{gcd}(Z_r, Z_s)} \\right)} = \\Omega \\cdot \\text{gcd}(Z_r, Z_s) $$\nThis result is consistent, as the primary frequencies of interaction, the rotor and stator blade passing frequencies (from a stationary and rotating frame, respectively), $\\omega_{BPF,r} = Z_r \\Omega$ and $\\omega_{BPF,s} = Z_s \\Omega$, are both integer multiples of this fundamental frequency $\\omega_0$.\n\nWe now apply this derived formula to the specific case provided.\nThe given values are:\n- Rotor blade count, $Z_r = 24$.\n- Stator vane count, $Z_s = 30$.\n- Rotor angular speed, $\\Omega = 250\\pi\\,\\text{rad/s}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the greatest common divisor of $Z_r$ and $Z_s$:\n$$ \\text{gcd}(24, 30) $$\nWe can use the Euclidean algorithm:\n$30 = 1 \\cdot 24 + 6$\n$24 = 4 \\cdot 6 + 0$\nThe last non-zero remainder is $6$. Thus, $\\text{gcd}(24, 30) = 6$.\n\nNext, we compute the fundamental angular frequency $\\omega_0$ using the derived formula:\n$$ \\omega_0 = \\Omega \\cdot \\text{gcd}(Z_r, Z_s) = (250\\pi) \\cdot 6 = 1500\\pi \\, \\text{rad/s} $$\nThe problem requires a numerical value rounded to five significant figures.

The first five significant digits are $4$, $7$, $1$, $2$, and $3$. The sixth digit is $8$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fifth digit.\n$$ \\omega_0 \\approx 4712.4 \\, \\text{rad/s} $$\nThis is the required numerical value for the HB fundamental angular frequency.",

A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe starting point is the set of incompressible Navier–Stokes equations for a fluid with constant density $\\rho$ and kinematic viscosity $\\nu = \\mu/\\rho$.\nThe continuity equation is:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0\n$$\nThe momentum equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}\n$$\nThe velocity field is given as $\\mathbf{u} = (u(y,t), 0, 0)$. Substituting this into the continuity equation, $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} = 0$, yields $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0$, as $v=0$ and $w=0$. This confirms that the streamwise velocity $u$ is a function of only $y$ and $t$, i.e., $u=u(y,t)$.\n\nNext, we simplify the momentum equation. The nonlinear advection term is $(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = u \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial x}$. Since $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial x} = (\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}, 0, 0) = (0, 0, 0)$, the advection term is identically zero: $(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = 0$.\n\nThe momentum equation in the $x$-direction reduces to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} + \\nu \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2} \\right)\n$$\nUsing the facts that there is no imposed streamwise pressure gradient ($\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}=0$) and that $u$ depends only on $y$ and $t$, this equation simplifies dramatically to the one-dimensional diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}\n$$\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1.  No-slip at the wall: $u(0, t) = U_{w} \\cos(\\omega t)$.\n2.  Quiescent fluid in the far field: $u(y, t) \\to 0$ as $y \\to \\infty$.\n\nThe governing equation is linear, and the boundary condition at the wall provides forcing at a single angular frequency $\\omega$. For a linear system, a sinusoidal input at frequency $\\omega$ will result in a sinusoidal output at the same frequency $\\omega$ in the periodic steady state. Therefore, the solution $u(y,t)$ is guaranteed to be temporally monochromatic, containing only the fundamental frequency $\\omega$. This demonstrates the first part of the problem's request. Higher harmonics are not generated because the nonlinear advection term, which couples different frequencies, is zero.\n\nTo solve this problem, we employ the complex variable method. We define a complex velocity $\\tilde{u}(y,t)$ that satisfies the same PDE, but with a complex boundary condition:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{u}}{\\partial t} = \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 \\tilde{u}}{\\partial y^2}\n$$\nwith boundary conditions $\\tilde{u}(0, t) = U_{w} \\exp(\\mathrm{i}\\,\\omega t)$ and $\\tilde{u}(y, t) \\to 0$ as $y \\to \\infty$. The physical velocity $u(y,t)$ is then the real part of the complex solution, $u(y,t) = \\mathrm{Re}[\\tilde{u}(y,t)]$.\n\nWe seek a periodic steady-state solution of the form $\\tilde{u}(y,t) = \\widehat{u}_{1}(y) \\exp(\\mathrm{i}\\,\\omega t)$, where $\\widehat{u}_{1}(y)$ is the complex amplitude, which corresponds to the complex Fourier coefficient requested. Substituting this ansatz into the PDE gives:\n$$\n\\mathrm{i}\\,\\omega \\widehat{u}_{1}(y) \\exp(\\mathrm{i}\\,\\omega t) = \\nu \\frac{d^2 \\widehat{u}_{1}}{dy^2} \\exp(\\mathrm{i}\\,\\omega t)\n$$\nThis simplifies to a second-order ordinary differential equation for $\\widehat{u}_{1}(y)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 \\widehat{u}_{1}}{dy^2} - \\frac{\\mathrm{i}\\,\\omega}{\\nu} \\widehat{u}_{1}(y) = 0\n$$\nThe boundary conditions for $\\widehat{u}_{1}(y)$ are derived from those for $\\tilde{u}(y,t)$:\n1.  At $y=0$: $\\tilde{u}(0,t) = \\widehat{u}_{1}(0) \\exp(\\mathrm{i}\\,\\omega t) = U_{w} \\exp(\\mathrm{i}\\,\\omega t) \\implies \\widehat{u}_{1}(0) = U_{w}$.\n2.  As $y \\to \\infty$: $\\tilde{u}(y,t) \\to 0 \\implies \\widehat{u}_{1}(y) \\to 0$.\n\nThe characteristic equation for the ODE is $r^2 - \\frac{\\mathrm{i}\\,\\omega}{\\nu} = 0$, which has roots $r = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mathrm{i}\\,\\omega}{\\nu}}$.\nWe simplify the term $\\sqrt{\\mathrm{i}}$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\mathrm{i}} = \\sqrt{\\exp(\\mathrm{i}\\,\\frac{\\pi}{2})} = \\exp(\\mathrm{i}\\,\\frac{\\pi}{4}) = \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{4}) + \\mathrm{i}\\,\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\mathrm{i}\\,\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1+\\mathrm{i}}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nSo the roots are:\n$$\nr = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{\\nu}} \\frac{1+\\mathrm{i}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\pm (1+\\mathrm{i})\\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2\\nu}}\n$$\nThe general solution for $\\widehat{u}_{1}(y)$ is:\n$$\n\\widehat{u}_{1}(y) = C_{1} \\exp\\left( (1+\\mathrm{i}) y \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2\\nu}} \\right) + C_{2} \\exp\\left( -(1+\\mathrm{i}) y \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2\\nu}} \\right)\n$$\nTo satisfy the far-field boundary condition $\\widehat{u}_{1}(y) \\to 0$ as $y \\to \\infty$, the coefficient of the exponentially growing term must be zero, so $C_{1}=0$. The solution becomes:\n$$\n\\widehat{u}_{1}(y) = C_{2} \\exp\\left( -(1+\\mathrm{i}) y \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2\\nu}} \\right)\n$$\nApplying the wall boundary condition $\\widehat{u}_{1}(0) = U_{w}$:\n$$\n\\widehat{u}_{1}(0) = C_{2} \\exp(0) = C_{2} = U_{w}\n$$\nThus, the complex Fourier coefficient as a function of $y$ is:\n$$\n\\widehat{u}_{1}(y) = U_{w} \\exp\\left( -(1+\\mathrm{i}) y \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2\\nu}} \\right)\n$$\nThe question asks for this expression evaluated at a specific location $y=y_{0}$. Substituting $y=y_{0}$ gives the final expression. This analytical result serves as an exact solution for verifying a Harmonic Balance code. The code, if correctly implemented and free of numerical error for this linear problem, should return this complex value for the first harmonic amplitude at $y_0$ and zero for all higher harmonic amplitudes ($k>1$).",
