            "problem": "In supersonic combustor simulations within Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), elementary reactions are modeled by the law of mass action. Consider an elementary consumption step with overall molecularity $n$, written generically as a sum of $n$ reactant molecules transforming into products. Let $c_i$ denote the molar concentration of species $i$ in $\\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$, and let the scalar reaction progress rate $r$ for the elementary step be defined as the rate of consumption of an arbitrary reactant, with $r$ required to have units $\\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$. Assume the elementary step obeys the mass-action form $r = k \\prod_{i \\in \\mathcal{R}} c_i^{\\nu_i}$, where the product is over reactants, the stoichiometric orders $\\nu_i$ are positive integers that sum to $n$, and $k$ is the forward rate constant.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It is grounded in the fundamental principles of chemical kinetics and dimensional analysis, providing all necessary definitions and constraints to determine a unique, meaningful solution. The problem is therefore deemed valid and will be solved as stated.\n\nThe task is to determine the physical units of the forward rate constant, $k$, for an elementary reaction of overall molecularity $n$. The final result must be expressed as a set of exponents for the base units of meters ($\\text{m}$), moles ($\\text{mol}$), and seconds ($\\text{s}$). The analysis will proceed in three parts as requested: justifying the units of the reaction rate $r$, performing a dimensional analysis to find the units of $k$ for a general $n$, and verifying the result for specific cases.\n\nFirst, we justify the units of the reaction progress rate, $r$. The problem defines $c_i$ as the molar concentration of species $i$, with units of $\\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$. Molar concentration is defined as the amount of substance (in moles) per unit volume. The reaction rate for a species is fundamentally defined as the change in its concentration over time. As stated in the problem, we consider $r$ to be the rate of consumption of a reactant. Let us denote the concentration of an arbitrary reactant as $c$. Its rate of change with respect to time $t$ is the derivative $\\frac{dc}{dt}$. The rate of consumption is therefore $-\\frac{dc}{dt}$. The units of this quantity are derived from the units of concentration and time. Let $[X]$ denote the units of a physical quantity $X$.\nThe units of concentration are given as $[c] = \\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$.\nThe unit of time is the second, $[t] = \\text{s}$.\nThe units of the reaction rate $r$ are therefore:\n$$\n[r] = \\left[\\frac{dc}{dt}\\right] = \\frac{[c]}{[t]} = \\frac{\\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}}{\\text{s}} = \\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThis confirms from first principles that the required units of $r$ are $\\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, consistent with the problem statement.\n\nSecond, we perform a dimensional analysis on the given mass-action rate law to find the units of the rate constant $k$. The rate law for an elementary step is given as:\n$$\nr = k \\prod_{i \\in \\mathcal{R}} c_i^{\\nu_i}\n$$\nHere, $\\mathcal{R}$ is the set of reactant species, and $\\nu_i$ are the respective stoichiometric orders, which are positive integers. The overall molecularity of the reaction is $n = \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{R}} \\nu_i$.\n\nFor this equation to be dimensionally consistent, the units on the left-hand side must equal the units on the right-hand side.\n$$\n[r] = [k] \\left[\\prod_{i \\in \\mathcal{R}} c_i^{\\nu_i}\\right]\n$$\nThe units of the product term can be determined by raising the units of concentration to the power of each order $\\nu_i$ and multiplying.\n$$\n\\left[\\prod_{i \\in \\mathcal{R}} c_i^{\\nu_i}\\right] = \\prod_{i \\in \\mathcal{R}} [c_i]^{\\nu_i} = \\prod_{i \\in \\mathcal{R}} (\\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-3})^{\\nu_i}\n$$\nUsing the property of exponents $(a^b)^c = a^{bc}$ and $a^b a^c = a^{b+c}$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\left[\\prod_{i \\in \\mathcal{R}} c_i^{\\nu_i}\\right] = (\\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-3})^{\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{R}} \\nu_i}\n$$\nSince the overall molecularity is $n = \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{R}} \\nu_i$, the units of the product of concentrations are:\n$$\n\\left[\\prod_{i \\in \\mathcal{R}} c_i^{\\nu_i}\\right] = (\\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-3})^{n} = \\text{mol}^{n}\\,\\text{m}^{-3n}\n$$\nNow, we can solve for the units of $k$:\n$$\n[k] = \\frac{[r]}{\\left[\\prod_{i \\in \\mathcal{R}} c_i^{\\nu_i}\\right]}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived units for $[r]$ and the concentration product term:\n$$\n[k] = \\frac{\\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}}{\\text{mol}^{n}\\,\\text{m}^{-3n}}\n$$\nTo simplify this expression, we combine the exponents for each base unit (m, mol, s):\n$$\n[k] = (\\text{m}^{-3}) \\cdot (\\text{m}^{-(-3n)}) \\cdot (\\text{mol}^{1}) \\cdot (\\text{mol}^{-n}) \\cdot (\\text{s}^{-1})\n$$\n$$\n[k] = \\text{m}^{-3 + 3n} \\cdot \\text{mol}^{1 - n} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n[k] = \\text{m}^{3(n-1)} \\cdot \\text{mol}^{1-n} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the answer in the form of an ordered triple of exponents $(\\alpha(n), \\beta(n), \\gamma)$ corresponding to the units $\\text{m}^{\\alpha(n)}\\,\\text{mol}^{\\beta(n)}\\,\\text{s}^{\\gamma}$. By inspection of our derived unit for $k$, we identify these exponents:\n$\\alpha(n) = 3(n-1)$\n$\\beta(n) = 1-n$\n$\\gamma = -1$\n\nThird, we verify this general result for unimolecular ($n=1$), bimolecular ($n=2$), and termolecular ($n=3$) reactions.\n\nCase 1: Unimolecular reaction ($n=1$)\nThe rate law is of the form $r = k c_A$.\nUsing our general formula for the units of $k$:\n$[k] = \\text{m}^{3(1-1)} \\cdot \\text{mol}^{1-1} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1} = \\text{m}^{0} \\cdot \\text{mol}^{0} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1} = \\text{s}^{-1}$.\nThis is the well-known unit for a first-order rate constant. The exponents are $(\\alpha(1), \\beta(1), \\gamma) = (0, 0, -1)$.\n\nCase 2: Bimolecular reaction ($n=2$)\nThe rate law is of the form $r = k c_A c_B$ or $r = k c_A^2$.\nUsing our general formula:\n$[k] = \\text{m}^{3(2-1)} \\cdot \\text{mol}^{1-2} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1} = \\text{m}^{3} \\cdot \\text{mol}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}$.\nThis is the standard unit for a second-order rate constant when concentration is in $\\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$. The exponents are $(\\alpha(2), \\beta(2), \\gamma) = (3, -1, -1)$.\n\nCase 3: Termolecular reaction ($n=3$)\nThe rate law is of the form $r = k c_A c_B c_C$ (or other combinations of order $3$).\nUsing our general formula:\n$[k] = \\text{m}^{3(3-1)} \\cdot \\text{mol}^{1-3} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1} = \\text{m}^{6} \\cdot \\text{mol}^{-2} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}$.\nThis is the correct unit for a third-order rate constant with the given concentration units. The exponents are $(\\alpha(3), \\beta(3), \\gamma) = (6, -2, -1)$.\n\nThe verifications confirm the correctness of our general derivation. The requested triple of exponents for the units of $k$ as a function of the overall molecularity $n$ is $(3(n-1), 1-n, -1)$.",

By computing its spectral radius, you will learn to diagnose the stiffness of a system and make informed decisions about the necessity of using implicit integration schemes to maintain numerical stability in a CFD simulation .",

            "problem": "You are given a simplified global-kinetics description of hydrogen–oxygen chemistry, intended for use in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The mechanism aggregates elementary steps into a single irreversible overall reaction, written in terms of molar concentrations. The goal is to compute the spectral radius of the source-term Jacobian for the species ordinary differential equations at a given thermodynamic state and composition, and then assess the need for implicit integration based on a stability criterion involving the spectral radius.\n\nStart from the following fundamental bases:\n- The ideal-gas law for a mixture, stating that the total molar concentration is $c_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\dfrac{p}{R\\,T}$, where $p$ is the pressure, $T$ is the temperature, and $R$ is the universal gas constant.\n- The mass-action law for an irreversible reaction rate with Arrhenius kinetics, where the rate of progress is $\\omega = k(T)\\,c_{\\mathrm{H_2}}^{a}\\,c_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^{b}$, $k(T) = A\\,T^{n}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\dfrac{E_{a}}{R\\,T}\\right)$, and $a$, $b$ are reaction orders with respect to $\\mathrm{H_2}$ and $\\mathrm{O_2}$, respectively.\n- Definitions of source terms for species concentrations based on stoichiometry.\n\nConsider the global reaction $\\mathrm{H_2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\mathrm{O_2} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{H_2O}$ with stoichiometric coefficients $\\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2}} = 1$, $\\nu_{\\mathrm{O_2}} = 0.5$, and $\\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} = 1$. Let the reaction orders be $a = 1$ and $b = 1$. Let the Arrhenius parameters be $A = 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{m^{3}\\,mol^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}$, $n = 0$, and $E_{a} = 1.6\\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$. Use $R = 8.314462618\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$.\n\nDefine the species molar concentrations by $c_{i} = y_{i}\\,c_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ for $i \\in \\{\\mathrm{H_2}, \\mathrm{O_2}, \\mathrm{H_2O}\\}$, where $y_{\\mathrm{H_2}}$ and $y_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$ are given mole fractions, and $y_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} = 1 - y_{\\mathrm{H_2}} - y_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$. Assume $y_{\\mathrm{H_2}} \\ge 0$, $y_{\\mathrm{O_2}} \\ge 0$, and $y_{\\mathrm{H_2}} + y_{\\mathrm{O_2}} \\le 1$.\n\nThe source terms for the species ordinary differential equations are defined as\n$$\n\\frac{d c_{\\mathrm{H_2}}}{dt} = -\\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2}}\\,\\omega,\\quad\n\\frac{d c_{\\mathrm{O_2}}}{dt} = -\\nu_{\\mathrm{O_2}}\\,\\omega,\\quad\n\\frac{d c_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}}{dt} = +\\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}\\,\\omega.\n$$\nLet $\\mathbf{c} = \\begin{bmatrix} c_{\\mathrm{H_2}} \\\\ c_{\\mathrm{O_2}} \\\\ c_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} \\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{c}) = \\begin{bmatrix} f_{\\mathrm{H_2}} \\\\ f_{\\mathrm{O_2}} \\\\ f_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} \\end{bmatrix}$ be the source terms as above.

The spectral radius is $\\rho(\\mathbf{J}) = \\max_{i} |\\lambda_{i}|$, where $\\lambda_{i}$ are the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{J}$.\n\nAssessment criterion for implicit integration: given a time step $\\Delta t$ representative of the explicit CFD integration, declare that implicit integration is needed if $\\,\\Delta t \\cdot \\rho(\\mathbf{J}) \\ge 1\\,$, and not needed otherwise.\n\nImplement a complete program that, for each test case, computes:\n- The spectral radius $\\rho(\\mathbf{J})$ in $\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n- A boolean indicating whether implicit integration is needed by the above criterion.\n\nExpress the spectral radius in $\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the spectral radius of the chemical source-term Jacobian for a simplified hydrogen-oxygen reaction mechanism and an assessment of the numerical stability for explicit time integration. The analysis proceeds from first principles as laid out in the problem statement.\n\nThe fundamental governing equations are:\n1.  **Ideal Gas Law**: The total molar concentration $c_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ is related to pressure $p$ and temperature $T$ by $c_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\dfrac{p}{R\\,T}$, where $R$ is the universal gas constant.\n2.  **Molar Concentrations**: For a species $i$, its molar concentration is $c_i = y_i c_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, where $y_i$ is its mole fraction.\n3.  **Reaction Rate**: The single global reaction $\\mathrm{H_2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\mathrm{O_2} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{H_2O}$ proceeds at a rate of progress $\\omega$ given by the law of mass action:\n    $$\n    \\omega = k(T)\\,c_{\\mathrm{H_2}}^{a}\\,c_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^{b}\n    $$\n    The problem specifies the reaction orders as $a=1$ and $b=1$.\n4.  **Rate Constant**: The temperature-dependent rate constant $k(T)$ follows the Arrhenius law:\n    $$\n    k(T) = A\\,T^{n}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_{a}}{R\\,T}\\right)\n    $$\n    The problem provides the parameters $A = 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{m^{3}\\,mol^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}$, $n = 0$, and $E_{a} = 1.6\\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n5.  **Species Source Terms**: The rates of change of species concentrations are given by:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d c_{\\mathrm{H_2}}}{dt} = -\\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2}}\\,\\omega \\quad;\\quad\n    \\frac{d c_{\\mathrm{O_2}}}{dt} = -\\nu_{\\mathrm{O_2}}\\,\\omega \\quad;\\quad\n    \\frac{d c_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}}{dt} = +\\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}\\,\\omega\n    $$\n    with stoichiometric coefficients $\\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2}} = 1$, $\\nu_{\\mathrm{O_2}} = 0.5$, and $\\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} = 1$.\n\nThe system of ordinary differential equations can be written in vector form as $\\dfrac{d\\mathbf{c}}{dt} = \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{c})$, where the state vector is $\\mathbf{c} = \\begin{bmatrix} c_{\\mathrm{H_2}} & c_{\\mathrm{O_2}} & c_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} \\end{bmatrix}^T$ and the source term vector is $\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{c}) = \\omega(\\mathbf{c}) \\mathbf{s}$, with $\\mathbf{s} = \\begin{bmatrix} -\\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2}} & -\\nu_{\\mathrm{O_2}} & \\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} \\end{bmatrix}^T = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & -0.5 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}^T$.\n\nThe primary task is to compute the spectral radius $\\rho(\\mathbf{J})$ of the Jacobian matrix $\\mathbf{J} = \\dfrac{\\partial \\mathbf{f}}{\\partial \\mathbf{c}}$.

The components of this gradient are the partial derivatives of $\\omega$ with respect to each species concentration. With $\\omega = k(T) c_{\\mathrm{H_2}} c_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial c_{\\mathrm{H_2}}} = k(T) c_{\\mathrm{O_2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial c_{\\mathrm{O_2}}} = k(T) c_{\\mathrm{H_2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial c_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}} = 0\n$$\nThe gradient transpose is $(\\nabla_{\\mathbf{c}} \\omega)^T = \\begin{bmatrix} k(T) c_{\\mathrm{O_2}} & k(T) c_{\\mathrm{H_2}} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nThe Jacobian matrix $\\mathbf{J}$ is thus the outer product:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J} = \\begin{bmatrix} -\\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2}} \\\\ -\\nu_{\\mathrm{O_2}} \\\\ \\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} k(T) c_{\\mathrm{O_2}} & k(T) c_{\\mathrm{H_2}} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = k(T) \\begin{bmatrix}\n-\\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2}} c_{\\mathrm{O_2}} & -\\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2}} c_{\\mathrm{H_2}} & 0 \\\\\n-\\nu_{\\mathrm{O_2}} c_{\\mathrm{O_2}} & -\\nu_{\\mathrm{O_2}} c_{\\mathrm{H_2}} & 0 \\\\\n\\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} c_{\\mathrm{O_2}} & \\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} c_{\\mathrm{H_2}} & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nA matrix formed by an outer product of two non-zero vectors is a rank-1 matrix. An $m \\times m$ rank-1 matrix has at most one non-zero eigenvalue. For a matrix $\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{u}\\mathbf{v}^T$, the non-zero eigenvalue is $\\lambda = \\mathbf{v}^T \\mathbf{u}$, and this eigenvalue is also equal to the trace of the matrix, $Tr(\\mathbf{A})$. In our case, the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{J}$ are $\\lambda_1 = Tr(\\mathbf{J})$ and $\\lambda_2 = \\lambda_3 = 0$.\n\nThe trace of the Jacobian is the sum of its diagonal elements:\n$$\nTr(\\mathbf{J}) = J_{11} + J_{22} + J_{33} = (-k(T)\\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2}} c_{\\mathrm{O_2}}) + (-k(T)\\nu_{\\mathrm{O_2}} c_{\\mathrm{H_2}}) + 0\n$$\n$$\nTr(\\mathbf{J}) = -k(T)(\\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2}} c_{\\mathrm{O_2}} + \\nu_{\\mathrm{O_2}} c_{\\mathrm{H_2}})\n$$\nThe eigenvalues are therefore $\\lambda_1 = -k(T)(\\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2}} c_{\\mathrm{O_2}} + \\nu_{\\mathrm{O_2}} c_{\\mathrm{H_2}})$, $\\lambda_2 = 0$, $\\lambda_3 = 0$.\nThe spectral radius is defined as $\\rho(\\mathbf{J}) = \\max_i |\\lambda_i|$. Since $k(T)$, all concentrations $c_i$, and all stoichiometric coefficients $\\nu_i$ are non-negative, the non-zero eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$ is always non-positive. Thus, the spectral radius is:\n$$\n\\rho(\\mathbf{J}) = |\\lambda_1| = k(T)(\\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2}} c_{\\mathrm{O_2}} + \\nu_{\\mathrm{O_2}} c_{\\mathrm{H_2}})\n$$\nThis analytical expression allows for the direct calculation of the spectral radius without numerically computing eigenvalues.\n\nThe computational procedure for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Given $T$, $p$, $y_{\\mathrm{H_2}}$, $y_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$, and $\\Delta t$.\n2.  Calculate the total molar concentration: $c_{\\mathrm{tot}} = p/(R T)$.\n3.  Calculate the species molar concentrations: $c_{\\mathrm{H_2}} = y_{\\mathrm{H_2}} c_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ and $c_{\\mathrm{O_2}} = y_{\\mathrm{O_2}} c_{\\mathrm{tot}}$.\n4.  Calculate the rate constant: $k(T) = A\\,\\exp(-E_a/(R T))$, since $n=0$.\n5.  Calculate the spectral radius using the derived formula: $\\rho(\\mathbf{J}) = k(T)(\\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2}} c_{\\mathrm{O_2}} + \\nu_{\\mathrm{O_2}} c_{\\mathrm{H_2}})$.\n6.  Assess the stability criterion: evaluate if $\\Delta t \\cdot \\rho(\\mathbf{J}) \\ge 1$. The result is a boolean value (`True` if the condition is met, `False` otherwise).\n\nThis algorithm is implemented for each provided test case.",
