            "solution": "### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- A rigid, horizontal, straight cylinder.\n- Constant cross-sectional area: $A$.\n- Length: $L$.\n- The cylinder is filled with an inviscid, incompressible fluid.\n- Fluid density: $\\rho$.\n- Right end at $x=L$ is open to a plenum with constant pressure $p_{\\infty}$.\n- Left end at $x=0$ is sealed by a piston.\n- Piston mass: $m_p$.\n- The piston is attached to a linear spring of stiffness $k_s$.\n- Piston undergoes small-amplitude axial motion $x(t)$ about its equilibrium position.\n- $x(t)$ is the piston displacement into the cylinder (positive $x$-direction).\n- Neglect gravity, viscous effects, and thermal effects.\n- One-dimensional plug flow is assumed: $u(x,t) \\equiv \\dot{x}(t)$ for $0 \\le x \\le L$.\n- The plenum pressure remains $p_{\\infty}$ at $x=L$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. It describes a classical mechanical oscillator (mass-spring system) coupled with a fluid column. The governing principles are Newton's second law and the conservation of mass and momentum for a fluid, which are fundamental to physics and engineering.\n\nThe problem is well-posed. The assumptions provided (inviscid, incompressible, 1D plug flow, small oscillations) are standard simplifying assumptions used to reduce a complex fluid-structure interaction problem to a linear ordinary differential equation, for which a unique solution for the natural frequency exists.\n\nThe problem is objective. The language is precise, and the parameters are clearly defined. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\nThe problem setup is self-contained and consistent. All necessary parameters ($A$, $L$, $\\rho$, $p_{\\infty}$, $m_p$, $k_s$) are provided to derive the equation of motion and the natural frequency. The kinematic constraint $u(x,t) = \\dot{x}(t)$ is consistent with the incompressibility of the fluid in a constant-area duct with one moving boundary and one open boundary.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Equation of Motion\n\nThe objective is to derive the linear equation of motion for the piston displacement $x(t)$ and find the natural frequency $\\omega_n$ of the system. This requires applying Newton's second law to the piston and the conservation of linear momentum to the fluid column.\n\n**1. Fluid Dynamics: Conservation of Linear Momentum**\n\nWe apply the integral form of the linear momentum equation in the $x$-direction to a fixed control volume (CV) encompassing the fluid within the cylinder, from $x=0$ to $x=L$. The momentum equation for a fixed CV is:\n$$\n\\sum F_x = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\int_{\\text{CV}} \\rho u \\, dV + \\int_{\\text{CS}} (\\rho u) (\\vec{v} \\cdot d\\vec{A})\n$$\nwhere $\\sum F_x$ is the sum of external surface forces on the fluid in the $x$-direction, $u$ is the $x$-component of the fluid velocity $\\vec{v}$, and the integrals are over the control volume (CV) and control surface (CS).\n\n- **Surface Forces ($\\sum F_x$):**\nThe external forces acting on the fluid in the control volume are due to pressure at the boundaries $x=0$ and $x=L$. The force at $x=0$ is $p(0, t)A$ acting in the positive $x$-direction. The force at $x=L$ is $p(L, t)A = p_{\\infty}A$ acting in the negative $x$-direction. Viscous forces are neglected.\n$$\n\\sum F_x = p(0, t) A - p_{\\infty} A\n$$\n\n- **Rate of Change of Momentum in CV:**\nThe fluid velocity is spatially uniform (plug flow), $u(t) = \\dot{x}(t)$. The volume element is $dV = A \\, dx$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\int_{\\text{CV}} \\rho u \\, dV = \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{0}^{L} \\rho \\dot{x}(t) A \\, dx = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left[ \\rho \\dot{x}(t) A L \\right]\n$$\nSince $\\rho$, $A$, and $L$ are constants, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left[ \\rho A L \\dot{x}(t) \\right] = \\rho A L \\ddot{x}(t)\n$$\n\n- **Momentum Flux across CS:**\nThe momentum flux is calculated at the inlet ($x=0$) and outlet ($x=L$). The velocity vector is $\\vec{v} = u(t)\\hat{i} = \\dot{x}(t)\\hat{i}$.\nAt the inlet ($x=0$): $d\\vec{A} = -A\\hat{i}$. The flux is $\\int_{A} (\\rho u) (\\vec{v} \\cdot d\\vec{A}) = \\rho \\dot{x}(t) (\\dot{x}(t)\\hat{i} \\cdot (-A\\hat{i})) = -\\rho A (\\dot{x}(t))^2$.\nAt the outlet ($x=L$): $d\\vec{A} = A\\hat{i}$. The flux is $\\int_{A} (\\rho u) (\\vec{v} \\cdot d\\vec{A}) = \\rho \\dot{x}(t) (\\dot{x}(t)\\hat{i} \\cdot (A\\hat{i})) = \\rho A (\\dot{x}(t))^2$.\nThe net momentum flux across the control surface is the sum of these two terms:\n$$\n\\int_{\\text{CS}} (\\rho u) (\\vec{v} \\cdot d\\vec{A}) = \\rho A (\\dot{x}(t))^2 - \\rho A (\\dot{x}(t))^2 = 0\n$$\n\n- **Assembling the Fluid Momentum Equation:**\nSubstituting all terms back into the momentum equation:\n$$\np(0, t) A - p_{\\infty} A = \\rho A L \\ddot{x}(t) + 0\n$$\nThis gives a relationship between the pressure at $x=0$ and the fluid acceleration:\n$$\np(0, t) - p_{\\infty} = \\rho L \\ddot{x}(t)\n$$\n\n**2. Piston Dynamics: Newton's Second Law**\n\nWe apply Newton's second law, $\\sum F_x = m_p \\ddot{x}(t)$, to the piston of mass $m_p$. The piston is located at position $x(t)$. The forces acting on the piston in the $x$-direction are:\n- **Spring Force:** The spring opposes the displacement from equilibrium. Force is $-k_s x(t)$.\n- **Pressure Force from Fluid:** The fluid pressure $p(x(t), t)$ acts on the face of the piston, creating a force $-p(x(t), t)A$.\n- **Pressure Force on Back of Piston:** It is implicit that the back of the piston is exposed to the same large plenum pressure $p_{\\infty}$. This creates a force $p_{\\infty}A$.\n\nThe equation of motion for the piston is:\n$$\nm_p \\ddot{x}(t) = -k_s x(t) - p(x(t), t)A + p_{\\infty}A\n$$\n$$\nm_p \\ddot{x}(t) = -k_s x(t) - (p(x(t), t) - p_{\\infty})A\n$$\nFor small-amplitude oscillations, the piston displacement $x(t)$ is small. The pressure difference between the piston's instantaneous position $x(t)$ and the fixed reference $x=0$ is negligible. That is, $p(x(t), t) \\approx p(0, t)$, because any pressure gradient term multiplied by the small displacement $x(t)$ would be a second-order effect, which we neglect in a linear analysis. Thus, we can write:\n$$\nm_p \\ddot{x}(t) \\approx -k_s x(t) - (p(0, t) - p_{\\infty})A\n$$\n\n**3. Coupling the Equations and Finding the Natural Frequency**\n\nWe now substitute the result from the fluid momentum equation into the piston's equation of motion.\n$$\np(0, t) - p_{\\infty} = \\rho L \\ddot{x}(t)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the piston equation:\n$$\nm_p \\ddot{x}(t) = -k_s x(t) - (\\rho L \\ddot{x}(t))A\n$$\nRearranging the terms to the standard form of a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation:\n$$\nm_p \\ddot{x}(t) + \\rho A L \\ddot{x}(t) + k_s x(t) = 0\n$$\n$$\n(m_p + \\rho A L) \\ddot{x}(t) + k_s x(t) = 0\n$$\nThis is the linear equation of motion for the coupled system. It is in the form $M_{\\text{eff}} \\ddot{x}(t) + K_{\\text{eff}} x(t) = 0$.\n\n- **Effective Mass and Added Mass:**\nThe effective mass of the oscillating system is $M_{\\text{eff}} = m_p + \\rho A L$. The term $\\rho A L$ is the mass of the entire fluid column in the cylinder. This is the **added mass**, $m_{\\text{added}}$, contributed by the fluid that must be accelerated along with the piston.\n$$\nm_{\\text{added}} = \\rho A L\n$$\n\n- **Natural Angular Frequency:**\nThe natural angular frequency, $\\omega_n$, of a simple harmonic oscillator described by $M \\ddot{x} + K x = 0$ is given by $\\omega_n = \\sqrt{K/M}$. For our system:\n- Effective stiffness $K_{\\text{eff}} = k_s$.\n- Effective mass $M_{\\text{eff}} = m_p + \\rho A L$.\n\nTherefore, the natural angular frequency of the small free oscillations is:\n$$\n\\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{K_{\\text{eff}}}{M_{\\text{eff}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_s}{m_p + \\rho A L}}\n$$\nThis expression provides the natural frequency in radians per second in terms of the given system parameters.",

            "solution": "The problem presents a simplified one-dimensional model of Fluid–Structure Interaction (FSI), a topic of significant interest in aerospace Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The model consists of a piston-spring system coupled with a fluid column. The fluid's inertial effect is modeled as an added mass. The task is to analyze the numerical stability of two different time-integration schemes for this system: a monolithic implicit scheme and a loosely coupled partitioned scheme.\n\nThe problem statement has been validated and is deemed sound. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of classical mechanics and numerical analysis, well-posed with clear objectives, and uses precise, objective language. All necessary data and definitions are provided. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe governing equation for the coupled system is given as:\n$$\n(m_s + m_f) \\ddot{x}(t) + k x(t) = 0\n$$\nwhere $m_s$ is the structural mass of the piston, $m_f = \\rho_f A L$ is the added mass of the fluid, $k$ is the spring stiffness, and $x(t)$ is the piston displacement. This is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator with total mass $M = m_s + m_f$ and natural frequency $\\omega_n = \\sqrt{k/M}$.\n\n(a) Monolithic Implicit Scheme\n\nFor the monolithic scheme, the entire system of equations is solved simultaneously at each time step. We use the backward Euler method for time discretization. Let us first represent the second-order Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) as a system of two first-order ODEs. Let the state vector be $\\mathbf{y}(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} x(t) \\\\ v(t) \\end{pmatrix}$, where $v(t) = \\dot{x}(t)$ is the velocity.\n\nThe system is:\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{y}}(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\dot{x}(t) \\\\ \\dot{v}(t) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -\\frac{k}{m_s + m_f} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x(t) \\\\ v(t) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe backward Euler discretization with a time step $\\Delta t$ is defined by $\\mathbf{y}^{n+1} = \\mathbf{y}^n + \\Delta t \\dot{\\mathbf{y}}^{n+1}$. Applying this to our system:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} x^{n+1} \\\\ v^{n+1} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x^n \\\\ v^n \\end{pmatrix} + \\Delta t \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -\\frac{k}{m_s + m_f} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x^{n+1} \\\\ v^{n+1} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis can be rearranged to solve for the state at time step $n+1$:\n$$\n\\left( \\mathbf{I} - \\Delta t \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -\\frac{k}{m_s + m_f} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\begin{pmatrix} x^{n+1} \\\\ v^{n+1} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x^n \\\\ v^n \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -\\Delta t \\\\ \\frac{k \\Delta t}{m_s + m_f} & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x^{n+1} \\\\ v^{n+1} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x^n \\\\ v^n \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe update from step $n$ to $n+1$ is thus governed by the inverse of the matrix on the left, which is the amplification matrix $\\mathbf{G}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{G} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -\\Delta t \\\\ \\frac{k \\Delta t}{m_s + m_f} & 1 \\end{pmatrix}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{k (\\Delta t)^2}{m_s + m_f}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\Delta t \\\\ -\\frac{k \\Delta t}{m_s + m_f} & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor linear stability, the spectral radius of the amplification matrix, $\\rho(\\mathbf{G})$, must be less than or equal to $1$. The eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $\\mathbf{G}$ are found from the characteristic equation $\\det(\\mathbf{G} - \\lambda \\mathbf{I}) = 0$. Using the form of $\\mathbf{G}$ before taking the inverse, the eigenvalues of the matrix on the left are $\\lambda_L = 1 \\pm i \\Delta t \\sqrt{k/(m_s+m_f)}$, so the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{G}$ are $\\lambda = 1/\\lambda_L$.\nThe magnitude of the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{G}$ is:\n$$\n|\\lambda| = \\frac{1}{|1 \\pm i \\Delta t \\sqrt{k/(m_s+m_f)}|} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1^2 + \\left( \\Delta t \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m_s+m_f}} \\right)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{k (\\Delta t)^2}{m_s+m_f}}}\n$$\nFor the scheme to be stable, we require $|\\lambda| \\le 1$. This condition is satisfied provided $1 + \\frac{k (\\Delta t)^2}{m_s+m_f} \\ge 1$. Since $k \\ge 0$, $(\\Delta t)^2 > 0$, and for any physical system $m_s+m_f > 0$, this inequality always holds. The numerical scheme is therefore unconditionally stable for any physically meaningful and non-negative values of $m_s$, $m_f$, and $k$.\n\nThe stability of the monolithic scheme depends only on the total mass $m_s+m_f$, not on the individual values of $m_s$ or $m_f$ or their ratio. As long as the total mass is positive, the scheme is stable. The physical constraint on mass is $m_s \\ge 0$. The numerical scheme imposes no additional lower bound. Therefore, the minimum structural mass for stability is zero.\n$$\nm_{s,\\text{min}}^{\\text{mono}} = 0\n$$\n\n(b) Loosely Coupled Partitioned Scheme\n\nIn this scheme, the fluid and structure equations are solved sequentially. The fluid force on the structure at step $n+1$ is calculated using the structural acceleration from the previous step, $n$. The total force on the piston is from the spring and the fluid. Newton's second law for the structure's mass $m_s$ is:\n$$\nm_s \\ddot{x}(t) + k x(t) = F_f(t)\n$$\nwhere the fluid force is $F_f(t) = -m_f \\ddot{x}(t)$. The partitioned scheme discretizes this as:\n$$\nm_s \\ddot{x}^{n+1} + k x^{n+1} = -m_f \\ddot{x}^n\n$$\nThe problem directs us to consider the case where the spring stiffness is zero, $k=0$, to isolate the instability arising from the fluid-structure coupling itself (the \"artificial added mass\" instability). Setting $k=0$, the equation becomes:\n$$\nm_s \\ddot{x}^{n+1} = -m_f \\ddot{x}^n\n$$\nLet $a^n = \\ddot{x}^n$ be the acceleration at time step $n$. The update rule for acceleration from one step to the next is:\n$$\na^{n+1} = \\left(-\\frac{m_f}{m_s}\\right) a^n\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear recurrence relation. For the sequence of accelerations $\\{a^n\\}$ to be stable (i.e., not grow without bound), the magnitude of the amplification factor must be less than or equal to $1$.\n$$\n\\left| -\\frac{m_f}{m_s} \\right| \\le 1\n$$\nSince masses $m_s$ and $m_f$ are non-negative, and $m_s$ must be positive to avoid division by zero, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{m_f}{m_s} \\le 1\n$$\nThis implies a necessary condition for the stability of the loosely coupled partitioned scheme:\n$$\nm_s \\ge m_f\n$$\nThe structural mass must be greater than or equal to the added mass of the fluid. This dictates a non-zero lower bound on $m_s$ for stability. The minimal structural mass required is equal to the fluid added mass.\n$$\nm_{s,\\text{min}}^{\\text{part}} = m_f\n$$\n\n(c) Difference in Stability Bounds\n\nWe are asked to compute the difference $\\Delta m = m_{s,\\text{min}}^{\\text{part}} - m_{s,\\text{min}}^{\\text{mono}}$.\nUsing the results from parts (a) and (b):\n$$\n\\Delta m = m_f - 0 = m_f\n$$\nThe added mass $m_f$ is defined as $m_f = \\rho_f A L$.

It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, and mathematically verifiable.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core of the problem is to analyze the convergence of the sub-iterative fixed-point scheme. The scheme is defined by the fluid and structural update equations within a time step.\n\nFirst, let's combine the two sub-iterative equations into a single recurrence relation for the displacement $u^{(k+1)}$ in terms of $u^{(k)}$.\nThe structural update is:\n$$\\frac{m_s}{\\Delta t}\\left(u^{(k+1)}-u^n\\right)+k_s\\,u^{(k+1)}=-t^{(k)}$$\nSubstitute the fluid traction evaluation, $t^{(k)}=\\frac{m_a}{\\Delta t}\\left(u^{(k)}-u^n\\right)$:\n$$\\frac{m_s}{\\Delta t}\\left(u^{(k+1)}-u^n\\right)+k_s\\,u^{(k+1)}=-\\frac{m_a}{\\Delta t}\\left(u^{(k)}-u^n\\right)$$\nWe want to solve for $u^{(k+1)}$. Grouping terms with $u^{(k+1)}$:\n$$u^{(k+1)}\\left(\\frac{m_s}{\\Delta t} + k_s\\right) = \\frac{m_s}{\\Delta t}u^n - \\frac{m_a}{\\Delta t}u^{(k)} + \\frac{m_a}{\\Delta t}u^n$$\n$$u^{(k+1)}\\left(\\frac{m_s + k_s\\Delta t}{\\Delta t}\\right) = u^n\\left(\\frac{m_s+m_a}{\\Delta t}\\right) - u^{(k)}\\left(\\frac{m_a}{\\Delta t}\\right)$$\nIsolating $u^{(k+1)}$ gives the fixed-point iteration map:\n$$u^{(k+1)} = \\frac{m_s+m_a}{m_s + k_s\\Delta t} u^n - \\frac{m_a}{m_s + k_s\\Delta t} u^{(k)}$$\nThis is a linear fixed-point iteration of the form $u^{(k+1)} = G(u^{(k)})$. The exact monolithic solution $u^*$ is the fixed point of this iteration, meaning $u^* = G(u^*)$:\n$$u^* = \\frac{m_s+m_a}{m_s + k_s\\Delta t} u^n - \\frac{m_a}{m_s + k_s\\Delta t} u^*$$\nTo analyze convergence, we define the error at sub-iteration $k$ as $e^{(k)} = u^{(k)} - u^*$.\nSubtracting the fixed-point equation from the iteration map equation:\n$$u^{(k+1)} - u^* = \\left(\\frac{m_s+m_a}{m_s + k_s\\Delta t} u^n - \\frac{m_a}{m_s + k_s\\Delta t} u^{(k)}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{m_s+m_a}{m_s + k_s\\Delta t} u^n - \\frac{m_a}{m_s + k_s\\Delta t} u^*\\right)$$\n$$u^{(k+1)} - u^* = - \\frac{m_a}{m_s + k_s\\Delta t} \\left(u^{(k)} - u^*\\right)$$\nThis gives the error propagation formula:\n$$e^{(k+1)} = r \\cdot e^{(k)}, \\quad \\text{where } r = - \\frac{m_a}{m_s + k_s\\Delta t}$$\nThe term $r$ is the geometric factor or the amplification factor of the error. After $N$ sub-iterations, the error is $e^{(N)} = r^N e^{(0)}$.\n\n**Stability and Accuracy Analysis:**\n*   **Stability**: The fixed-point iteration is stable (converges) if and only if the magnitude of the geometric factor is less than one: $|r| < 1$.\n    $$|r| = \\left|- \\frac{m_a}{m_s + k_s\\Delta t}\\right| = \\frac{m_a}{m_s + k_s\\Delta t}$$\n    (since $m_s, m_a, k_s, \\Delta t$ are all non-negative and the denominator is positive). The condition for convergence is $\\frac{m_a}{m_s + k_s\\Delta t} < 1$. This is not unconditional; it depends on the physical and numerical parameters. This is the well-known \"added-mass instability\" issue in partitioned FSI: if the added mass $m_a$ is too large relative to the structural mass and stiffness-time-step term, the explicit Dirichlet-Neumann coupling becomes unstable.\n*   **Accuracy**: The error decreases geometrically with each sub-iteration. The magnitude of the error is reduced by a factor of $|r|$ at each step. Thus, the accuracy improves as $\\mathcal{O}(|r|^N)$.\n\n**Calculation for Practical Equivalence:**\nWe are given the criterion for practical equivalence:\n$$\\frac{\\left|u^{(N)}-u^{*}\\right|}{\\left|u^{*}-u^n\\right|}\\le 0.01$$\nThe error after $N$ iterations is $|u^{(N)} - u^*| = |r|^N |u^{(0)} - u^*|$.\nThe initial guess is $u^{(0)} = u^n$, so the initial error is $|u^n - u^*|$.\nSubstituting this into the criterion:\n$$\\frac{|r|^N \\left|u^{n}-u^{*}\\right|}{\\left|u^{*}-u^n\\right|} = |r|^N \\le 0.01$$\nNow, we substitute the given parameters: $m_s=1$, $m_a=0.5$, $k_s=100$, and $\\Delta t=0.01$.\nFirst, calculate the magnitude of the geometric factor $|r|$:\n$$|r| = \\frac{m_a}{m_s + k_s\\Delta t} = \\frac{0.5}{1 + (100)(0.01)} = \\frac{0.5}{1 + 1} = \\frac{0.5}{2} = 0.25$$\nSince $|r| = 0.25 < 1$, the scheme is stable for these parameters.\nWe now need to find the smallest integer $N$ such that:\n$$(0.25)^N \\le 0.01$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left((0.25)^N\\right) \\le \\ln(0.01)$$\n$$N \\ln(0.25) \\le \\ln(0.01)$$\nSince $\\ln(0.25)$ is a negative number, dividing by it reverses the inequality sign:\n$$N \\ge \\frac{\\ln(0.01)}{\\ln(0.25)}$$\nUsing $\\ln(0.01) = \\ln(10^{-2}) = -2\\ln(10) \\approx -4.60517$ and $\\ln(0.25) = \\ln(4^{-1}) = -\\ln(4) = -2\\ln(2) \\approx -1.38629$:\n$$N \\ge \\frac{-4.60517}{-1.38629} \\approx 3.3219$$\nSince the number of sub-iterations $N$ must be an integer, the smallest integer $N$ that satisfies this condition is $N=4$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A. The sub-iterative Dirichlet–Neumann scheme is unconditionally stable regardless of the number of sub-iterations and added mass; accuracy improves linearly with the number of sub-iterations; for the given parameters, $N=2$ sub-iterations achieve practical equivalence.**\n    *   The scheme is not unconditionally stable; its stability depends on $|r| = \\frac{m_a}{m_s + k_s\\Delta t} < 1$. This statement is incorrect.\n    *   Accuracy improves geometrically ($\\mathcal{O}(|r|^N)$), not linearly. This statement is incorrect.\n    *   Our calculation shows $N=4$ is required, not $N=2$. For $N=2$, the error reduction is $(0.25)^2=0.0625$, which is not $\\le 0.01$. This statement is incorrect.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B. The fixed-point error reduction per sub-iteration has a geometric factor $r=\\dfrac{m_a}{m_s+k_s\\,\\Delta t}$, so stability requires $\\left|r\\right|<1$ and accuracy improves geometrically as $\\mathcal{O}\\!\\left(\\left|r\\right|^N\\right)$; for the given parameters, $r=0.25$ and $N=4$ sub-iterations are sufficient to reach practical equivalence.**\n    *   The \"error reduction\" factor is $r = - \\frac{m_a}{m_s + k_s\\Delta t}$. The option omits the negative sign. However, the magnitude of this factor, which governs the rate of convergence and stability, is $|r| = \\frac{m_a}{m_s+k_s\\,\\Delta t}$. It is common in literature to refer to $|r|$ as the convergence factor or rate. The stability condition $|r|<1$ and geometric convergence $\\mathcal{O}(|r|^N)$ are stated correctly.\n    *   For the given parameters, the option states $r=0.25$, which is our calculated value for $|r|$.\n    *   The option states $N=4$ sub-iterations are sufficient, which matches our calculation for the smallest integer $N$.\n    *   Despite the slight imprecision in defining $r$ (omitting the sign), all other technical points and the final numerical result are correct. This is the best description among the choices.\n    *   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **C. Convergence of the sub-iterations requires $\\left|r\\right|>1$ due to the added-mass effect; accuracy improves only algebraically with $N$; for the given parameters, a single sub-iteration ($N=1$) is sufficient to reach practical equivalence.**\n    *   Convergence of any fixed-point scheme requires the amplification factor's magnitude to be less than $1$ (i.e., $|r|<1$). The statement $|r|>1$ is the condition for divergence. This is incorrect.\n    *   Accuracy improves geometrically, not algebraically. This statement is incorrect.\n    *   For $N=1$, the error reduction is $(0.25)^1 = 0.25$, which is not $\\le 0.01$. This statement is incorrect.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. The number of sub-iterations affects accuracy but not stability; the geometric factor for the given parameters is $r=0.9$, so $N=10$ sub-iterations are needed to reach practical equivalence.**\n    *   The first clause is partially true: for a given set of parameters, the system is either stable or unstable, independent of $N$. However, stability itself is not guaranteed. The main point is that the claim about the geometric factor is incorrect.\n    *   The geometric factor's magnitude is $|r|=0.25$, not $0.9$. This is a calculation error.\n    *   The required number of iterations is $N=4$, not $N=10$. If $|r|$ were $0.9$, then we would need $N \\ge \\ln(0.01)/\\ln(0.9) \\approx 43.7$, so $N=44$. The value $N=10$ is inconsistent with both the correct and the incorrect geometric factor.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
