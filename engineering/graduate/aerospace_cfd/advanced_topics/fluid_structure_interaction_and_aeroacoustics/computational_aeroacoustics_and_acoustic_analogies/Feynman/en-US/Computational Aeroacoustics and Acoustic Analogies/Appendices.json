This practice delves into the heart of Lighthill's acoustic analogy by focusing on the quadrupole source term, which represents the turbulent stress fluctuations that dominate noise generation in free-shear flows like jets. By applying dimensional analysis to this source term, you will derive the celebrated eighth-power law for jet noise, building a physical intuition for how fundamental flow parameters like velocity and length scale dictate the radiated acoustic power .",

            "problem": "Consider a high Reynolds number, subsonic turbulent jet in a quiescent medium of ambient density $\\rho_{0}$ and sound speed $c_{0}$. The jet has a characteristic mean flow speed $U$ and an energy-containing length scale $L$. Assume the compact-source limit for the energy-containing turbulence, in the sense that the acoustic wavelength associated with the dominant source frequencies is large compared with $L$, with a Strouhal number $\\mathrm{St} \\equiv \\omega L/U$ of order unity. Using the Lighthill Acoustic Analogy (LAA), model the dominant acoustic source as the quadrupole arising from the divergence of the Reynolds stress, represented by the source term $\\partial_{ij}(\\rho u_{i} u_{j})$ in the inhomogeneous acoustic wave equation. By dimensional analysis grounded in this framework, derive the far-field scaling of the total radiated acoustic power $W$ in terms of $\\rho_{0}$, $c_{0}$, $U$, and $L$, and then express your final result explicitly in terms of Mach number $M \\equiv U/c_{0}$. You may neglect dimensionless constants of order unity and assume statistical isotropy of the turbulence. Report the power scaling in Watts (SI units). The final answer must be a single closed-form analytic expression in $\\rho_{0}$, $c_{0}$, $L$, and $M$; do not provide intermediate equations as the final answer.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the scaling law for the total radiated acoustic power, $W$, from a high Reynolds number, subsonic turbulent jet. The derivation will be based on a dimensional analysis of the Lighthill Acoustic Analogy (LAA).\n\nThe Lighthill Acoustic Analogy recasts the exact Navier-Stokes equations into an inhomogeneous wave equation for the acoustic pressure perturbation, $p' = p - p_0$. In an unbounded quiescent medium, this equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{c_0^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 p'}{\\partial t^2} - \\nabla^2 p' = \\frac{\\partial^2 T_{ij}}{\\partial x_i \\partial x_j}\n$$\nwhere $c_0$ is the ambient speed of sound, and $T_{ij}$ is the Lighthill stress tensor. For a high Reynolds number flow with no external body forces or heat sources, this tensor is well approximated by the Reynolds stress term, $T_{ij} \\approx \\rho u_i u_j$. The problem statement directs us to model the dominant source using this term, specifically $\\partial_{ij}(\\rho u_i u_j)$. For a subsonic jet, density fluctuations within the turbulent flow are small compared to the ambient density $\\rho_0$, so we can further approximate $T_{ij} \\approx \\rho_0 u_i u_j$. The source term on the right-hand side is thus a quadrupole source.\n\nThe solution to the inhomogeneous wave equation in the far field (where the distance to the observer, $r = |\\mathbf{x}|$, is much larger than the source dimension $L$) can be found using a Green's function approach. For a compact source, which is assumed in the problem statement (acoustic wavelength $\\lambda \\gg L$), the far-field pressure perturbation is given by:\n$$\np'(\\mathbf{x}, t) \\approx \\frac{1}{4\\pi c_0^2 r} \\frac{x_i x_j}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2} \\int_V T_{ij}(\\mathbf{y}, t - r/c_0) dV(\\mathbf{y})\n$$\nwhere the integral is over the source volume $V$.\n\nWe now perform a dimensional analysis to determine the scaling of $p'$.\nThe characteristic velocity fluctuations in the turbulent jet scale with the mean flow speed, $U$. Therefore, the Lighthill stress tensor scales as:\n$$\nT_{ij} \\sim \\rho_0 U^2\n$$\nThe source volume, characterized by the energy-containing length scale $L$, scales as $V \\sim L^3$. The integral of the stress tensor over this volume thus scales as:\n$$\n\\int_V T_{ij} dV \\sim (\\rho_0 U^2) L^3\n$$\nThe characteristic frequency of the energy-containing turbulent eddies, $\\omega$, is related to the velocity $U$ and length scale $L$. The problem states that the Strouhal number, $\\mathrm{St} \\equiv \\omega L/U$, is of order unity. This implies that the characteristic frequency scales as $\\omega \\sim U/L$. The second time derivative in the pressure expression, therefore, scales as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2} \\sim \\omega^2 \\sim \\left(\\frac{U}{L}\\right)^2\n$$\nSubstituting these scalings into the expression for the far-field pressure perturbation $p'$ (and neglecting dimensionless constants like $4\\pi$ and geometric factors like $x_i x_j/r^2$, which are of order unity when averaged over all directions), we obtain:\n$$\np' \\sim \\frac{1}{c_0^2 r} \\left(\\frac{U}{L}\\right)^2 (\\rho_0 U^2 L^3) = \\frac{\\rho_0 U^4 L}{c_0^2 r}\n$$\nThe acoustic intensity, $I$, is the time-averaged acoustic energy flux per unit area. It is given by $I = \\frac{\\overline{p'^2}}{\\rho_0 c_0}$. The time average of the squared pressure perturbation, $\\overline{p'^2}$, scales as the square of the characteristic pressure perturbation amplitude, $(p')^2$:\n$$\nI \\sim \\frac{(p')^2}{\\rho_0 c_0} \\sim \\frac{1}{\\rho_0 c_0} \\left( \\frac{\\rho_0 U^4 L}{c_0^2 r} \\right)^2 = \\frac{\\rho_0^2 U^8 L^2}{\\rho_0 c_0 c_0^4 r^2} = \\frac{\\rho_0 U^8 L^2}{c_0^5 r^2}\n$$\nThe total radiated acoustic power, $W$, is found by integrating the intensity $I$ over the surface of a large sphere of radius $r$. The surface area of this sphere is $4\\pi r^2$. The integration accounts for the directional dependence of the radiation, but for scaling purposes, we can simply multiply the characteristic intensity by the surface area, which scales as $r^2$.\n$$\nW = \\int_{S} I dS \\sim I \\times r^2 \\sim \\left(\\frac{\\rho_0 U^8 L^2}{c_0^5 r^2}\\right) r^2 = \\frac{\\rho_0 U^8 L^2}{c_0^5}\n$$\nThis is the celebrated Lighthill's eighth-power law, which states that the acoustic power radiated by a turbulent jet scales with the eighth power of the jet velocity.\n\nThe final step is to express this scaling in terms of the jet Mach number, $M \\equiv U/c_0$. We substitute $U = M c_0$ into the expression for $W$:\n$$\nW \\sim \\frac{\\rho_0 (M c_0)^8 L^2}{c_0^5} = \\frac{\\rho_0 M^8 c_0^8 L^2}{c_0^5} = \\rho_0 c_0^3 L^2 M^8\n$$\nAs the problem requires us to neglect dimensionless constants of order unity, this scaling relation represents the final expression for the total radiated acoustic power. The units are consistent with power (Watts in the SI system), as can be verified by dimensional analysis: $[\\rho_0 c_0^3 L^2] = (\\frac{M_{mass}}{L_{len}^3}) (\\frac{L_{len}}{T_{time}})^3 (L_{len}^2) = \\frac{M_{mass} L_{len}^2}{T_{time}^3}$, which are the dimensions of power (Energy/Time).",

Continuity Source Term, $q_{\\rho}$:**\n$q_{\\rho} = \\partial_{t} \\rho' + \\rho_{0} \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}'$\n$q_{\\rho} = -\\frac{\\omega P}{c_{0}^{2}} \\cos(\\alpha x) \\cos(\\beta y) \\sin(\\omega t) + \\rho_{0} (\\alpha U + \\beta V) \\cos(\\alpha x) \\cos(\\beta y) \\sin(\\omega t)$\n$q_{\\rho}(x,y,t) = \\left( \\rho_{0}(\\alpha U + \\beta V) - \\frac{\\omega P}{c_{0}^{2}} \\right) \\cos(\\alpha x) \\cos(\\beta y) \\sin(\\omega t)$\n\n**2. $x$-Momentum Source Term, $q_{u_x}$:**\n$q_{u_x} = \\partial_{t} u' + \\frac{1}{\\rho_{0}} \\partial_{x} p'$\n$q_{u_x} = \\omega U \\sin(\\alpha x) \\cos(\\beta y) \\cos(\\omega t) + \\frac{1}{\\rho_{0}} (-\\alpha P \\sin(\\alpha x) \\cos(\\beta y) \\cos(\\omega t))$\n$q_{u_x}(x,y,t) = \\left( \\omega U - \\frac{\\alpha P}{\\rho_{0}} \\right) \\sin(\\alpha x) \\cos(\\beta y) \\cos(\\omega t)$\n\n**3. $y$-Momentum Source Term, $q_{u_y}$:**\n$q_{u_y} = \\partial_{t} v' + \\frac{1}{\\rho_{0}} \\partial_{y} p'$\n$q_{u_y} = \\omega V \\cos(\\alpha x) \\sin(\\beta y) \\cos(\\omega t) + \\frac{1}{\\rho_{0}} (-\\beta P \\cos(\\alpha x) \\sin(\\beta y) \\cos(\\omega t))$\n$q_{u_y}(x,y,t) = \\left( \\omega V - \\frac{\\beta P}{\\rho_{0}} \\right) \\cos(\\alpha x) \\sin(\\beta y) \\cos(\\omega t)$\n\n**4. Pressure Source Term, $q_{p}$:**\n$q_{p} = \\partial_{t} p' + \\gamma p_{0} \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}'$\n$q_{p} = -\\omega P \\cos(\\alpha x) \\cos(\\beta y) \\sin(\\omega t) + \\gamma p_{0} (\\alpha U + \\beta V) \\cos(\\alpha x) \\cos(\\beta y) \\sin(\\omega t)$\n$q_{p}(x,y,t) = \\left( \\gamma p_{0}(\\alpha U + \\beta V) - \\omega P \\right) \\cos(\\alpha x) \\cos(\\beta y) \\sin(\\omega t)$\n\nUsing the relation $c_{0}^{2} = \\gamma p_{0} / \\rho_{0}$, we can write $\\gamma p_{0} = \\rho_{0} c_{0}^{2}$. Substituting this into the expression for $q_p$ yields:\n$q_{p}(x,y,t) = \\left( \\rho_{0} c_{0}^{2}(\\alpha U + \\beta V) - \\omega P \\right) \\cos(\\alpha x) \\cos(\\beta y) \\sin(\\omega t)$\nWe can observe that $q_{p} = c_{0}^{2} q_{\\rho}$, which provides a consistency check on our derivation, as expected from the structure of the LEE and the isentropic assumption.\n\nThe final source term vector $\\boldsymbol{S}(x,y,t)$ is formed by assembling these individual components.\n$\\boldsymbol{S}(x,y,t) = (q_{\\rho}, q_{u_x}, q_{u_y}, q_{p})$\n$\\boldsymbol{S}(x,y,t) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\left( \\rho_{0}(\\alpha U + \\beta V) - \\frac{\\omega P}{c_{0}^{2}} \\right) \\cos(\\alpha x) \\cos(\\beta y) \\sin(\\omega t) \\\\ \\left( \\omega U - \\frac{\\alpha P}{\\rho_{0}} \\right) \\sin(\\alpha x) \\cos(\\beta y) \\cos(\\omega t) \\\\ \\left( \\omega V - \\frac{\\beta P}{\\rho_{0}} \\right) \\cos(\\alpha x) \\sin(\\beta y) \\cos(\\omega t) \\\\ \\left( \\gamma p_{0}(\\alpha U + \\beta V) - \\omega P \\right) \\cos(\\alpha x) \\cos(\\beta y) \\sin(\\omega t) \\end{pmatrix}^{T}$\nThe problem asks for the answer as a single expression, which will be formatted as a row matrix in the final answer box.",
