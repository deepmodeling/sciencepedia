            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It presents a standard exercise in numerical linear algebra, specifically the application of Gaussian elimination to perform an $LU$ decomposition on a given matrix. The context provided, relating the matrix to a finite difference discretization in CFD, is accurate and adds relevant physical motivation. There are no flaws that would invalidate the problem. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe task is to find the $LU$ factorization of the matrix $A$ such that $A=LU$, where $L$ is a unit-lower-triangular matrix and $U$ is an upper-triangular matrix. This factorization is achieved through the process of Gaussian elimination. The matrix $A$ is given by:\n$$\nA \\;=\\; \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n0 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe process of Gaussian elimination aims to transform $A$ into an upper-triangular matrix $U$ by applying a sequence of elementary row operations.\n\n**Step 1: Elimination in the first column**\n\nWe seek to eliminate the non-zero entry below the first pivot, $a_{11} = 2$. The entry to be eliminated is $a_{21} = -1$. The multiplier for this step, denoted $m_{21}$, is the ratio of the element to be eliminated to the pivot element:\n$$\nm_{21} = \\frac{a_{21}}{a_{11}} = \\frac{-1}{2}\n$$\nThe corresponding row operation is $R_2 \\leftarrow R_2 - m_{21} R_1$. Applying this to the matrix $A$:\n$$\nR_2 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) R_1 = [-1, 2, -1] - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) [2, -1, 0] = [-1, 2, -1] + [1, -\\frac{1}{2}, 0] = [0, \\frac{3}{2}, -1]\n$$\nThe entry $a_{31}$ is already $0$, so no operation is needed for the third row in this column. The multiplier is $m_{31}=0$. The matrix after this step is:\n$$\nA^{(1)} \\;=\\; \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\frac{3}{2} & -1 \\\\\n0 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Elimination in the second column**\n\nNow we proceed to the second column. The pivot is the new diagonal entry $a'_{22} = \\frac{3}{2}$. We must eliminate the entry below it, which is $a'_{32} = -1$. The multiplier for this step, $m_{32}$, is:\n$$\nm_{32} = \\frac{a'_{32}}{a'_{22}} = \\frac{-1}{3/2} = -\\frac{2}{3}\n$$\nThe corresponding row operation is $R_3 \\leftarrow R_3 - m_{32} R_2$. Applying this to the current state of the matrix, $A^{(1)}$:\n$$\nR_3 - \\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\right) R_2 = [0, -1, 2] - \\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\right) [0, \\frac{3}{2}, -1] = [0, -1, 2] + [0, 1, -\\frac{2}{3}] = [0, 0, 2 - \\frac{2}{3}] = [0, 0, \\frac{4}{3}]\n$$\nThe elimination process is now complete. The resulting upper-triangular matrix is $U$:\n$$\nU \\;=\\; \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\frac{3}{2} & -1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\frac{4}{3}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\n**Construction of the L and U matrices**\n\nThe upper-triangular matrix $U$ is the result of the forward elimination. The unit-lower-triangular matrix $L$ is constructed by placing the multipliers $m_{ij}$ in the corresponding lower-triangular positions:\n$$\nL \\;=\\; \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\nm_{21} & 1 & 0 \\\\\nm_{31} & m_{32} & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values for the multipliers:\n$$\nL \\;=\\; \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{2} & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -\\frac{2}{3} & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe elimination multipliers are $m_{21} = -\\frac{1}{2}$ and $m_{32} = -\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\n**Determinant Calculation**\n\nThe determinant of $A$ can be calculated from the factorization $A = LU$. Using the property that the determinant of a product of matrices is the product of their determinants, we have $\\det(A) = \\det(L)\\det(U)$.\nThe determinant of a triangular matrix is the product of its diagonal entries.\nFor the unit-lower-triangular matrix $L$, the diagonal entries are all $1$, so its determinant is:\n$$\n\\det(L) = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = 1\n$$\nFor the upper-triangular matrix $U$, the determinant is:\n$$\n\\det(U) = u_{11} \\cdot u_{22} \\cdot u_{33} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{3}\n$$\nPerforming the multiplication:\n$$\n\\det(U) = (2 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2}) \\cdot \\frac{4}{3} = 3 \\cdot \\frac{4}{3} = 4\n$$\nTherefore, the determinant of $A$ is:\n$$\n\\det(A) = \\det(L)\\det(U) = 1 \\cdot 4 = 4\n$$\nThe determinant of $A$ is exactly $4$.",

Substituting:\n$-(\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{3}{4}x_4) + 2x_4 = 1$\n$-\\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{3}{4}x_4 + 2x_4 = 1$\n$\\frac{5}{4}x_4 = \\frac{5}{4}$\nDividing by $\\frac{5}{4}$:\n$x_4 = 1$.\nSo, $d'_4 = 1$.\n\nThe forward elimination yields the upper triangular system:\n$x_1 - \\frac{1}{2}x_2 = \\frac{1}{2}$\n$x_2 - \\frac{2}{3}x_3 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n$x_3 - \\frac{3}{4}x_4 = \\frac{1}{4}$\n$x_4 = 1$\n\n**Stage 2: Backward Substitution**\nNow we solve for $x_i$ starting from the last equation and moving backward.\nFrom the last equation, we have:\n$x_4 = 1$\n\nSubstitute $x_4=1$ into the third equation:\n$x_3 = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{3}{4}x_4 = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{3}{4}(1) = \\frac{4}{4} = 1$\n\nSubstitute $x_3=1$ into the second equation:\n$x_2 = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{3}x_3 = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{3}(1) = \\frac{3}{3} = 1$\n\nSubstitute $x_2=1$ into the first equation:\n$x_1 = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}x_2 = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}(1) = \\frac{2}{2} = 1$\n\nThe solution vector is $x = [x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4]^T = [1, 1, 1, 1]^T$.\n\n**Verification**\nWe can verify the solution by substituting it back into the original equation $Ax=b$:\n$$\nA x = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n1 \\\\\n1 \\\\\n1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2(1) - 1(1) \\\\\n-1(1) + 2(1) - 1(1) \\\\\n-1(1) + 2(1) - 1(1) \\\\\n-1(1) + 2(1)\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n1\n\\end{bmatrix} = b\n$$\nThe result is correct. This solution corresponds to a constant scalar field $\\phi(x)=1$, which is the exact analytical solution to the continuous problem $-\\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^2}=0$ with boundary conditions $\\phi(\\text{left})=1$ and $\\phi(\\text{right})=1$.",
