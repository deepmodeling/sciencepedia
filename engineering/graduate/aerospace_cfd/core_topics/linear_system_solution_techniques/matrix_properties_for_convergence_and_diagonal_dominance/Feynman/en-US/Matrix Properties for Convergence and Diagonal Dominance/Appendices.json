            "problem": "In an implicit steady-state Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver for a one-dimensional duct segment in an aerospace application, consider the transport of a passive scalar governed by steady advection–diffusion with constant properties. The density is $\\rho$, the uniform axial speed is $u0$, the effective diffusion coefficient is $\\Gamma$, the cross-sectional area is $A$, and the uniform grid spacing is $\\Delta x$. The Finite Volume Method (FVM) is used on a uniform grid with control volume $i$ bounded by west and east faces. Let the face mass fluxes be $F_{w}=\\rho u A$ and $F_{e}=\\rho u A$, and the diffusive conductances be $D_{w}=\\Gamma A/\\Delta x$ and $D_{e}=\\Gamma A/\\Delta x$. Adopt first-order upwind interpolation for the convective fluxes and central differencing for the diffusive fluxes. Assume no physical volumetric source in the control volume interior and constant face mass fluxes.\n\n1) Starting from the steady integral conservation law for a control volume, discretize the advection and diffusion fluxes to obtain the linear equation at an interior node in the coefficient form $a_{P}\\,\\phi_{i}=a_{W}\\,\\phi_{i-1}+a_{E}\\,\\phi_{i+1}+b_{i}$, and express $a_{W}$, $a_{E}$, and $a_{P}$ in terms of $F_{w}$, $F_{e}$, $D_{w}$, and $D_{e}$ under the above assumptions.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), specifically the Finite Volume Method (FVM) for the advection-diffusion equation. It is well-posed, with a complete and consistent set of data and constraints that allow for a unique, step-by-step derivation and a final numerical answer. The language is objective and the problem is a standard, non-trivial exercise in a numerical methods course for engineering or physics.\n\n**Part 1: Discretization and Coefficient Derivation**\n\nThe integral form of the steady-state conservation law for a passive scalar $\\phi$ over a control volume $V$ is given by the balance of convection and diffusion fluxes across its boundary $\\partial V$:\n$$ \\oint_{\\partial V} \\rho \\phi \\vec{u} \\cdot d\\vec{S} - \\oint_{\\partial V} \\Gamma \\nabla\\phi \\cdot d\\vec{S} = 0 $$\nFor a one-dimensional control volume $i$ with faces at west ($w$) and east ($e$), this simplifies to:\n$$ \\left( (\\rho u A) \\phi \\right)_e - \\left( (\\rho u A) \\phi \\right)_w - \\left( (\\Gamma A) \\frac{d\\phi}{dx} \\right)_e + \\left( (\\Gamma A) \\frac{d\\phi}{dx} \\right)_w = 0 $$\nUsing the given definitions for face mass flux, $F = \\rho u A$, and diffusive conductance, $D = \\frac{\\Gamma A}{\\Delta x}$, the equation becomes:\n$$ F_e \\phi_e - F_w \\phi_w - D_e (\\phi_{i+1} - \\phi_i) + D_w (\\phi_i - \\phi_{i-1}) = 0 $$\nHere, we have applied central differencing for the diffusive flux gradients. For the convective fluxes, we use first-order upwind interpolation. Since the axial speed $u0$, the flow is from west to east. Therefore, the scalar value at a face is taken from the upwind (west) cell:\n- At the east face $e$, the upwind node is $i$, so $\\phi_e = \\phi_i$.\n- At the west face $w$, the upwind node is $i-1$, so $\\phi_w = \\phi_{i-1}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the flux balance equation:\n$$ F_e \\phi_i - F_w \\phi_{i-1} - D_e(\\phi_{i+1} - \\phi_i) + D_w(\\phi_i - \\phi_{i-1}) = 0 $$\nWe now rearrange the terms to match the specified form $a_{P}\\,\\phi_{i}=a_{W}\\,\\phi_{i-1}+a_{E}\\,\\phi_{i+1}+b_{i}$. Grouping terms by their nodal index:\n$$ (F_e + D_e + D_w)\\phi_i = (F_w + D_w)\\phi_{i-1} + D_e\\phi_{i+1} $$\nBy comparing this with the required form, we identify the coefficients for an interior node:\n- $a_W = F_w + D_w$\n- $a_E = D_e$\n- $a_P = F_e + D_e + D_w$\n- $b_i = 0$, as there is no physical source term.\n\nTo show that $a_P = a_W + a_E$, we sum the derived off-diagonal coefficients:\n$$ a_W + a_E = (F_w + D_w) + D_e = F_w + D_w + D_e $$\nThe problem states that \"face mass fluxes be $F_{w}=\\rho u A$ and $F_{e}=\\rho u A$\". This implies $F_w = F_e$. Substituting $F_w = F_e$ into the expression for $a_W + a_E$:\n$$ a_W + a_E = F_e + D_w + D_e $$\nThis is identical to our derived expression for $a_P$. Thus, for an interior node under the given assumptions, $a_P = a_W + a_E$.\n\n**Part 2: Pseudo-Time Term and Diagonal Enhancement**\n\nThe steady-state residual for node $i$ is $R_i = a_{W}\\,\\phi_{i-1}+a_{E}\\,\\phi_{i+1} - a_{P}\\,\\phi_{i}$. For an iterative solution, the equation $R_i=0$ is modified by adding a pseudo-transient term:\n$$ \\frac{\\rho V}{\\Delta t} (\\phi_i^{n+1} - \\phi_i^n) = R_i^{n+1} = a_{W}\\,\\phi_{i-1}^{n+1}+a_{E}\\,\\phi_{i+1}^{n+1} - a_{P}\\,\\phi_{i}^{n+1} $$\nwhere $n$ and $n+1$ are pseudo-time indices. Let $\\alpha = \\frac{\\rho V}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{\\rho A \\Delta x}{\\Delta t}$. The equation is rearranged to form the linear system for the unknowns at level $n+1$:\n$$ \\alpha \\phi_i^{n+1} - \\alpha \\phi_i^n = a_W \\phi_{i-1}^{n+1} + a_E \\phi_{i+1}^{n+1} - a_P \\phi_i^{n+1} $$\nMoving all terms with superscript $n+1$ to the left-hand side and the known term from level $n$ to the right-hand side gives:\n$$ a_P \\phi_i^{n+1} + \\alpha \\phi_i^{n+1} - a_W \\phi_{i-1}^{n+1} - a_E \\phi_{i+1}^{n+1} = \\alpha \\phi_i^n $$\n$$ (a_P + \\alpha) \\phi_i^{n+1} = a_W \\phi_{i-1}^{n+1} + a_E \\phi_{i+1}^{n+1} + \\alpha \\phi_i^n $$\nThis equation is of the form $a'_P \\phi_i^{n+1} = a'_W \\phi_{i-1}^{n+1} + a'_E \\phi_{i+1}^{n+1} + S_i^n$. The coefficients of the matrix for the linear system in $\\phi^{n+1}$ are:\n- Diagonal coefficient: $a'_P = a_P + \\alpha$.\n- Off-diagonal coefficients: $a'_W = a_W$ and $a'_E = a_E$.\nThis demonstrates that adding the pseudo-time term and linearizing for $\\phi^{n+1}$ results in the addition of the quantity $\\alpha$ to the main diagonal coefficient $a_P$, while the off-diagonal coefficients remain unchanged.\n\n**Part 3: Scaled Matrix Properties**\n\nThe linear system for $\\phi^{n+1}$ can be written as $A\\phi^{n+1}=b$. For an interior row $i$, the non-zero entries of the matrix $A$ are:\n$$ A_{i,i-1} = -a_W, \\quad A_{i,i} = a_P+\\alpha, \\quad A_{i,i+1} = -a_E $$\nThe diagonal matrix $D$ is defined by $D_{ii} = A_{ii} = a_P+\\alpha$. The left-scaled matrix is $\\tilde{A} = D^{-1}A$. The entries of row $i$ of $\\tilde{A}$ are:\n- Diagonal entry: $\\tilde{A}_{ii} = \\frac{A_{ii}}{D_{ii}} = \\frac{a_P+\\alpha}{a_P+\\alpha} = 1$. The diagonal entries of $\\tilde{A}$ are indeed unity.\n- Off-diagonal entries: $\\tilde{A}_{i,i-1} = \\frac{A_{i,i-1}}{D_{ii}} = \\frac{-a_W}{a_P+\\alpha}$ and $\\tilde{A}_{i,i+1} = \\frac{A_{i,i+1}}{D_{ii}} = \\frac{-a_E}{a_P+\\alpha}$.\n\nThe sum of the absolute values of the off-diagonal entries in row $i$ is $s_i = \\sum_{j\\neq i}|\\tilde{A}_{ij}|$.\n$$ s_i = |\\tilde{A}_{i,i-1}| + |\\tilde{A}_{i,i+1}| = \\left|\\frac{-a_W}{a_P+\\alpha}\\right| + \\left|\\frac{-a_E}{a_P+\\alpha}\\right| $$\nFrom Part $1$, $a_W = F_w + D_w$ and $a_E = D_e$. Since $\\rho, u, A, \\Gamma, \\Delta x$ are all positive, $F_w, D_w, D_e$ are positive, making $a_W0$ and $a_E0$. Also, $a_P = a_W+a_E  0$ and $\\alpha  0$. Therefore, the absolute value signs can be removed:\n$$ s_i = \\frac{a_W}{a_P+\\alpha} + \\frac{a_E}{a_P+\\alpha} = \\frac{a_W+a_E}{a_P+\\alpha} $$\nUsing the result from Part $1$ that $a_P = a_W+a_E$ for interior nodes, we can express $s_i$ solely in terms of $a_P$ and $\\alpha$:\n$$ s_i = \\frac{a_P}{a_P+\\alpha} $$\n\n**Part 4: Calculation of Maximum Pseudo-Time Step**\n\nThe condition for strict diagonal dominance with margin $\\eta$ is $s_i \\leq 1-\\eta$.\n$$ \\frac{a_P}{a_P+\\alpha} \\leq 1-\\eta $$\nSince $a_P  0$ and $a_P+\\alpha  0$, we can rearrange without changing the inequality direction:\n$$ a_P \\leq (1-\\eta)(a_P+\\alpha) \\implies a_P \\leq a_P + \\alpha - \\eta a_P - \\eta\\alpha \\implies \\eta a_P \\leq \\alpha(1-\\eta) $$\nSince $0  \\eta  1$, we have $1-\\eta  0$, so we can divide by it:\n$$ \\alpha \\geq \\frac{\\eta}{1-\\eta} a_P $$\nSubstituting $\\alpha = \\frac{\\rho A \\Delta x}{\\Delta t}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\rho A \\Delta x}{\\Delta t} \\geq \\frac{\\eta}{1-\\eta} a_P $$\nSolving for $\\Delta t$, we find an upper bound:\n$$ \\Delta t \\leq \\frac{\\rho A \\Delta x (1-\\eta)}{\\eta a_P} $$\nThe maximum pseudo-time step $\\Delta t_{\\max}$ corresponds to the equality:\n$$ \\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{\\rho A \\Delta x (1-\\eta)}{\\eta a_P} $$\nWe now compute the numerical values. The givens are $\\rho=1.225\\,\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{m}^{3}$, $u=200\\,\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s}$, $\\Gamma=0.5\\,\\mathrm{kg}/(\\mathrm{m}\\cdot\\mathrm{s})$, $A=1\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}$, $\\Delta x=0.01\\,\\mathrm{m}$, and $\\eta=0.2$.\nFirst, calculate $F$ and $D$:\n$$ F = \\rho u A = (1.225\\,\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{m}^{3})(200\\,\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s})(1\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}) = 245\\,\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{s} $$\n$$ D = \\frac{\\Gamma A}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{(0.5\\,\\mathrm{kg}/(\\mathrm{m}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}))(1\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2})}{0.01\\,\\mathrm{m}} = 50\\,\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{s} $$\nNext, calculate $a_P = a_W+a_E$. For the upwind scheme used ($u0$):\n$$ a_W = F_w + D_w = F+D = 245 + 50 = 295\\,\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{s} $$\n$$ a_E = D_e = D = 50\\,\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{s} $$\nThus, $a_P = a_W + a_E = 295 + 50 = 345\\,\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{s}$.\nThe term $\\rho A \\Delta x$ is:\n$$ \\rho A \\Delta x = (1.225\\,\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{m}^{3})(1\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2})(0.01\\,\\mathrm{m}) = 0.01225\\,\\mathrm{kg} $$\nThe margin is $\\eta=0.2$, so $1-\\eta=0.8$.\nNow, substitute these values into the expression for $\\Delta t_{\\max}$:\n$$ \\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{(0.01225\\,\\mathrm{kg})(0.8)}{(0.2)(345\\,\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{s})} = \\frac{0.0098}{69}\\,\\mathrm{s} \\approx 0.0001420289... \\,\\mathrm{s} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\Delta t_{\\max} = 0.0001420\\,\\mathrm{s}$. In scientific notation, this is $1.420 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s}$.",

A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the System Matrix $A$**\n\nThe finite volume method is based on the conservation principle applied to each control volume (CV). For a steady-state problem with no sources, the conservation of a scalar quantity $u$ in a control volume $i$ states that the sum of the fluxes across its faces is zero. The flux is due to convection only.\n\nThe net flux for CV $i$ is the sum of fluxes through its faces. Let's adopt the convention that outflow is positive and inflow is negative. The convective flux across a face is given by the product of the mass flux $F$ and the scalar value at the face, $u_{\\text{face}}$.\n$$ \\sum_{\\text{faces}} F_{\\text{face}} u_{\\text{face}} = 0 $$\nWith a constant mass flux $F$ and flow direction $1 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 1$, the equation for CV $i$ is:\n$$ F u_{\\text{east face}} - F u_{\\text{west face}} = 0 $$\nThe first-order upwind scheme dictates that the scalar value at a face, $u_{\\text{face}}$, is taken from the cell center of the upstream control volume. The flow is from $i \\to i+1$.\n\nFor CV $i$, the \"east\" face is between $i$ and $i+1$, and the \"west\" face is between $i-1$ and $i$.\n- The upstream cell for the east face is cell $i$. So, $u_{\\text{east face}} = u_i$.\n- The upstream cell for the west face is cell $i-1$. So, $u_{\\text{west face}} = u_{i-1}$.\n\nThe general discrete equation for CV $i$ is:\n$$ F u_i - F u_{i-1} = 0 $$\n\nApplying this to each of the $3$ control volumes with periodic boundary conditions:\n- **CV 1 ($i=1$)**: The upstream cell is CV 3. Thus, $u_{i-1} = u_3$. The equation is $F u_1 - F u_3 = 0$.\n- **CV 2 ($i=2$)**: The upstream cell is CV 1. Thus, $u_{i-1} = u_1$. The equation is $F u_2 - F u_1 = 0$.\n- **CV 3 ($i=3$)**: The upstream cell is CV 2. Thus, $u_{i-1} = u_2$. The equation is $F u_3 - F u_2 = 0$.\n\nThis system of linear equations can be written in matrix form $A \\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{0}$:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} F  0  -F \\\\ -F  F  0 \\\\ 0  -F  F \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\\\ u_2 \\\\ u_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThus, the system matrix $A$ is:\n$$ A = \\begin{pmatrix} F  0  -F \\\\ -F  F  0 \\\\ 0  -F  F \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n**Task 1: Diagonal Dominance and Gershgorin Disks**\n\nA matrix $A$ is weakly diagonally dominant by rows if $|a_{ii}| \\ge \\sum_{j \\ne i} |a_{ij}|$ for all rows $i$.\nLet's examine matrix $A$, assuming $F  0$:\n- **Row 1**: $|a_{11}| = |F| = F$. The sum of magnitudes of off-diagonal elements is $\\sum_{j \\ne 1} |a_{1j}| = |0| + |-F| = F$. Thus, $|a_{11}| = \\sum_{j \\ne 1} |a_{1j}|$.\n- **Row 2**: $|a_{22}| = |F| = F$. The sum of magnitudes of off-diagonal elements is $\\sum_{j \\ne 2} |a_{2j}| = |-F| + |0| = F$. Thus, $|a_{22}| = \\sum_{j \\ne 2} |a_{2j}|$.\n- **Row 3**: $|a_{33}| = |F| = F$. The sum of magnitudes of off-diagonal elements is $\\sum_{j \\ne 3} |a_{3j}| = |0| + |-F| = F$. Thus, $|a_{33}| = \\sum_{j \\ne 3} |a_{3j}|$.\n\nSince the equality $|a_{ii}| = \\sum_{j \\ne i} |a_{ij}|$ holds for all rows, the matrix $A$ is weakly diagonally dominant.\n\nAccording to Gershgorin's circle theorem, every eigenvalue of $A$ lies within the union of its Gershgorin disks. The $i$-th disk, $D_i$, is centered at $a_{ii}$ with radius $R_i = \\sum_{j \\ne i} |a_{ij}|$.\n- **Disk 1 ($i=1$)**: Center $C_1 = a_{11} = F$. Radius $R_1 = |a_{12}| + |a_{13}| = |0| + |-F| = F$. The disk is defined by $|z - F| \\le F$ in the complex plane.\n- **Disk 2 ($i=2$)**: Center $C_2 = a_{22} = F$. Radius $R_2 = |a_{21}| + |a_{23}| = |-F| + |0| = F$. The disk is defined by $|z - F| \\le F$.\n- **Disk 3 ($i=3$)**: Center $C_3 = a_{33} = F$. Radius $R_3 = |a_{31}| + |a_{32}| = |0| + |-F| = F$. The disk is defined by $|z - F| \\le F$.\n\nAll three disks are identical. The union of the disks is the single disk centered at $F$ on the real axis with radius $F$. To show this disk overlaps the origin, we check if $z=0$ is in the disk:\n$$ |0 - F| \\le F \\implies |-F| \\le F \\implies F \\le F $$\nThis inequality is true. The origin $z=0$ lies on the boundary of the disk. This is consistent with the fact that $A$ is singular (sum of each row is $0$, so $\\lambda=0$ is an eigenvalue), and all eigenvalues must lie in the union of the Gershgorin disks.\n\n**Task 2: Jacobi Iteration and Spectral Radius**\n\nThe Jacobi method for solving $A\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{b}$ is an iterative scheme. We decompose $A$ as $A = D + L + U$, where $D$ is the diagonal part of $A$, and $L$ and $U$ are the strictly lower and upper triangular parts, respectively. The iteration is given by:\n$$ \\mathbf{u}^{(k+1)} = -D^{-1}(L+U) \\mathbf{u}^{(k)} + D^{-1}\\mathbf{b} $$\nThe Jacobi iteration matrix is $T_J = -D^{-1}(L+U)$.\n\nFrom our matrix $A$:\n$$ D = \\begin{pmatrix} F  0  0 \\\\ 0  F  0 \\\\ 0  0  F \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad L+U = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  -F \\\\ -F  0  0 \\\\ 0  -F  0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe inverse of the diagonal matrix $D$ is:\n$$ D^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/F  0  0 \\\\ 0  1/F  0 \\\\ 0  0  1/F \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{F}I $$\nNow, we compute the Jacobi matrix $T_J$:\n$$ T_J = -D^{-1}(L+U) = -\\left( \\frac{1}{F}I \\right) \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  -F \\\\ -F  0  0 \\\\ 0  -F  0 \\end{pmatrix} = -\\frac{1}{F} \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  -F \\\\ -F  0  0 \\\\ 0  -F  0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  1 \\\\ 1  0  0 \\\\ 0  1  0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe spectral radius, $\\rho(T_J)$, is the maximum absolute value of the eigenvalues of $T_J$. To find the eigenvalues $\\lambda$, we solve the characteristic equation $\\det(T_J - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$ \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -\\lambda  0  1 \\\\ 1  -\\lambda  0 \\\\ 0  1  -\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0 $$\n$$ (-\\lambda) ((-\\lambda)(-\\lambda) - (0)(1)) - (0) + (1) ((1)(1) - (-\\lambda)(0)) = 0 $$\n$$ -\\lambda(\\lambda^2) + 1 = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda^3 = 1 $$\nThe eigenvalues of $T_J$ are the three cube roots of unity:\n$$ \\lambda_1 = 1 $$\n$$ \\lambda_2 = \\exp\\left(\\frac{i2\\pi}{3}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} $$\n$$ \\lambda_3 = \\exp\\left(\\frac{i4\\pi}{3}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2} - i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} $$\nThe absolute value of each eigenvalue is $1$:\n$$ |\\lambda_1| = 1, \\quad |\\lambda_2| = \\sqrt{\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2} = 1, \\quad |\\lambda_3| = \\sqrt{\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2} = 1 $$\nThe spectral radius is the maximum of these values:\n$$ \\rho(T_J) = \\max\\{1, 1, 1\\} = 1 $$\n\nThe Jacobi method is guaranteed to converge for any initial guess if and only if the spectral radius of its iteration matrix is strictly less than $1$ (i.e., $\\rho(T_J)  1$). Since $\\rho(T_J) = 1$, the method is not guaranteed to converge and, in general, will fail. This failure is a direct consequence of the physical and mathematical nature of the problem. The matrix $A$ is singular because the underlying physical problem (pure convection on a closed loop) conserves the scalar, meaning there is no unique solution. If $\\mathbf{u}$ is a solution, so is $\\mathbf{u} + c(1, 1, 1)^{\\mathsf{T}}$ for any constant $c$. The singularity of $A$ and the fact that $\\rho(T_J) = 1$ are intrinsically linked. Specifically, the eigenvalue $\\lambda=1$ of $T_J$ corresponds to a stationary error mode, preventing convergence to a unique solution.",
