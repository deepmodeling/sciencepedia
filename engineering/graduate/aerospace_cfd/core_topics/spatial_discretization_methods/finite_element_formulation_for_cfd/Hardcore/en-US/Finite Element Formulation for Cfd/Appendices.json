Computation of the $L^2$ norm of the error function by integration over the element area.\n\nThe triangular element, denoted as $T$, is defined by the three vertices $\\mathbf{P}_{1}=(0,0)$, $\\mathbf{P}_{2}=(1,0)$, and $\\mathbf{P}_{3}=(0,1)$.\n\nFirst, we determine the degree-$1$ Lagrange shape functions, $N_1(x,y)$, $N_2(x,y)$, and $N_3(x,y)$. These are linear polynomials of the form $N_i(x,y) = a_i + b_i x + c_i y$, which must satisfy the Kronecker delta property at the nodal points, i.e., $N_i(\\mathbf{P}_j) = \\delta_{ij}$.\n\nFor shape function $N_1(x,y)$:\n$N_1(0,0) = a_1 = 1$; $N_1(1,0) = a_1 + b_1 = 0 \\implies b_1 = -1$; $N_1(0,1) = a_1 + c_1 = 0 \\implies c_1 = -1$.\nThus, $N_1(x,y) = 1 - x - y$.\n\nFor shape function $N_2(x,y)$:\n$N_2(0,0) = a_2 = 0$; $N_2(1,0) = a_2 + b_2 = 1 \\implies b_2 = 1$; $N_2(0,1) = a_2 + c_2 = 0 \\implies c_2 = 0$.\nThus, $N_2(x,y) = x$.\n\nFor shape function $N_3(x,y)$:\n$N_3(0,0) = a_3 = 0$; $N_3(1,0) = a_3 + b_3 = 0 \\implies b_3 = 0$; $N_3(0,1) = a_3 + c_3 = 1 \\implies c_3 = 1$.\nThus, $N_3(x,y) = y$.\n\nNext, we construct the nodal interpolation $I_h u$ of the scalar field $u(x,y)=x^2+xy$. The interpolant is defined by:\n$$I_h u(x,y) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} u(\\mathbf{P}_i) N_i(x,y)$$\nWe evaluate $u(x,y)$ at the vertices:\n$u_1 = u(\\mathbf{P}_1) = u(0,0) = 0^2 + (0)(0) = 0$\n$u_2 = u(\\mathbf{P}_2) = u(1,0) = 1^2 + (1)(0) = 1$\n$u_3 = u(\\mathbf{P}_3) = u(0,1) = 0^2 + (0)(1) = 0$\n\nSubstituting these nodal values into the interpolation formula:\n$I_h u(x,y) = u_1 N_1(x,y) + u_2 N_2(x,y) + u_3 N_3(x,y) = (0)N_1(x,y) + (1)N_2(x,y) + (0)N_3(x,y) = N_2(x,y) = x$.\n\nThe interpolation error $e(x,y)$ is the difference between the original function and its interpolant:\n$e(x,y) = u(x,y) - I_h u(x,y) = (x^2 + xy) - x = x^2 + xy - x$.\n\nFinally, we compute the $L^2$ norm of the error, $\\|e\\|_{L^2(T)}$, which requires integrating the square of the error function over the triangular domain $T$.\n$$\\|e\\|_{L^2(T)}^2 = \\int_T e(x,y)^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}A = \\int_T (x^2 + xy - x)^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}A$$\nThe domain $T$ is described by the inequalities $x \\ge 0$, $y \\ge 0$, and $x+y \\le 1$.

This makes explicit time stepping extremely fast and computationally inexpensive, which is a major benefit for large-scale CFD.\n    -   **Disadvantage (Accuracy)**: Mass lumping is an approximation that degrades the spatial accuracy of the scheme. For convection-dominated problems, it significantly increases numerical dispersion error, causing waves to travel at incorrect speeds and smearing sharp flow features.\n\n-   **Consistent Mass Matrix ($M^{\\text{cons}}$)**:\n    -   **Advantage (Accuracy)**: This matrix is the direct result of the Galerkin projection and preserves the optimal accuracy of the finite element space. It has superior dispersion properties, which is critical for accurately simulating wave propagation in convection-dominated flows.\n    -   **Disadvantage (Efficiency)**: The matrix is sparse but not diagonal. Computing $M^{-1}\\mathbf{r}$ requires solving a linear system at every time step. Even with efficient iterative solvers, this is vastly more expensive than the simple scaling operation required for a lumped matrix, often making explicit schemes computationally prohibitive.\n\nIn summary, the choice is between the high computational efficiency of mass lumping and the superior accuracy (especially lower dispersion error) of the consistent mass matrix. For most large-scale explicit CFD codes, the efficiency gains of mass lumping are considered decisive.",

The quadrature weight $w$ is the area of the reference triangle, $w=1/2$. The approximation is:\n$$\nI \\approx w \\cdot \\left( N_1(\\tfrac{1}{3},\\tfrac{1}{3})^2 \\cdot |J(\\tfrac{1}{3},\\tfrac{1}{3})| \\right)\n$$\nAt the centroid, $L_1=1/3$, so $N_1(\\frac{1}{3},\\frac{1}{3}) = \\frac{1}{3}(2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} - 1) = -\\frac{1}{9}$. We already computed $|J(\\frac{1}{3},\\frac{1}{3})| = \\frac{676}{225}$.\n$$\nI \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^{2} \\cdot \\frac{676}{225} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{81} \\cdot \\frac{676}{225} = \\frac{676}{36450}\n$$\nSimplifying the fraction gives the final answer:\n$$\nI \\approx \\frac{338}{18225}\n$$",
            "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{338}{18225}}$$"
