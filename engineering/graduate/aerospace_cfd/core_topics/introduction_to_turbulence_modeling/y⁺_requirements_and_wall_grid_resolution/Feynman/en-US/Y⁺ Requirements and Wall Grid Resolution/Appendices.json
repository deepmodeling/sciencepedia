It is scientifically grounded in the principles of computational fluid dynamics for turbulent boundary layers, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is expressed in objective, formal language. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the smallest total number of grid layers required to ensure that there are grid interfaces located at or beyond three specified non-dimensional wall distances: $y^+ = 5$, $y^+ = 30$, and $y^+ = 300$.\n\nThe locations of the grid interfaces, denoted by $y_k^+$ for the $k$-th interface from the wall, are given by a geometric progression:\n$$y_k^+ = y_1^+ r^{k-1}$$\nwhere $k$ is an integer with $k \\ge 1$.

Therefore, the problem simplifies to finding the smallest integer $K$ that satisfies the most stringent condition:\n$$y_K^+ \\ge 300$$\n\nSubstituting the formula for $y_K^+$, we have:\n$$y_1^+ r^{K-1} \\ge 300$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values for $y_1^+$ and $r$:\n$$0.8 \\cdot (1.2)^{K-1} \\ge 300$$\n\nTo solve for $K$, we first isolate the term containing the exponent:\n$$(1.2)^{K-1} \\ge \\frac{300}{0.8}$$\n$$(1.2)^{K-1} \\ge 375$$\n\nNext, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the inequality.

The smallest integer $K$ that satisfies the condition $K \\ge 33.51$ is $34$.
