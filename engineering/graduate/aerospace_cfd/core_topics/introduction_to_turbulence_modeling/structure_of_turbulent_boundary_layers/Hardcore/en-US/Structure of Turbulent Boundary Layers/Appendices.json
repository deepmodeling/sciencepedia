Substituting this into the $C_f$ definition gives $C_f = \\frac{\\tau_w}{\\frac{1}{2}\\rho U_\\infty^2} = \\frac{\\rho u_\\tau^2}{\\frac{1}{2}\\rho U_\\infty^2} = 2\\left(\\frac{u_\\tau}{U_\\infty}\\right)^2$. We apply this formula to the Clauser-fit estimates of $u_{\\tau}$ for each grid. The free-stream speed is $U_{\\infty} = 30 \\ \\text{m/s}$.\n-   Coarse grid: $u_{\\tau,\\text{c}} = 1.00 \\ \\text{m/s}$.\n    $C_{f,\\text{c,Clauser}} = 2 \\left(\\frac{1.00}{30}\\right)^2 = \\frac{2 \\times 1.00^2}{900} = \\frac{2.00}{900}$.\n-   Medium grid: $u_{\\tau,\\text{m}} = 0.95 \\ \\text{m/s}$.\n    $C_{f,\\text{m,Clauser}} = 2 \\left(\\frac{0.95}{30}\\right)^2 = \\frac{2 \\times 0.95^2}{900} = \\frac{2 \\times 0.9025}{900} = \\frac{1.805}{900}$.\n-   Fine grid: $u_{\\tau,\\text{f}} = 0.92 \\ \\text{m/s}$.\n    $C_{f,\\text{f,Clauser}} = 2 \\left(\\frac{0.92}{30}\\right)^2 = \\frac{2 \\times 0.92^2}{900} = \\frac{2 \\times 0.8464}{900} = \\frac{1.6928}{900}$.\n\n3.  **Richardson Extrapolation to find the asymptotic value $C_f^{\\ast}$:**\nThe problem states that the discretization error is of order $p=2$. The grid dependence of a quantity $\\phi$ (in this case, $\\phi = C_f$) is modeled as $\\phi(h) = \\phi^{\\ast} + K h^{p}$, where $h$ is the characteristic grid spacing, $\\phi^{\\ast}$ is the exact, grid-independent value, and $K$ is a constant. We use the results from the fine grid (grid 1, spacing $h_1$) and the medium grid (grid 2, spacing $h_2$). The refinement ratio is $r = h_2/h_1 = 2$.\n\nThe solutions on the two grids are:\n$C_{f,1} = C_{f}^{\\ast} + K h_{1}^{p}$\n$C_{f,2} = C_{f}^{\\ast} + K h_{2}^{p} = C_{f}^{\\ast} + K (rh_1)^{p} = C_{f}^{\\ast} + r^{p} K h_{1}^{p}$\n\nTo find $C_f^{\\ast}$, we eliminate the unknown term $K h_1^p$. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives:\n$C_{f,2} - C_{f,1} = (r^p - 1) K h_1^p$\nThe error term in the fine grid solution is $E_1 = C_{f,1} - C_{f}^{\\ast} = K h_1^p$. Thus, we can write:\n$E_1 = \\frac{C_{f,2} - C_{f,1}}{r^p - 1}$\nThe extrapolated value $C_f^{\\ast}$ is the fine-grid solution minus its estimated error:\n$C_{f}^{\\ast} = C_{f,1} - E_1 = C_{f,1} - \\frac{C_{f,2} - C_{f,1}}{r^p - 1} = C_{f,1} + \\frac{C_{f,1} - C_{f,2}}{r^p - 1}$\nUsing the given values $p=2$ and $r=2$, the denominator is $r^p - 1 = 2^2 - 1 = 3$. The extrapolation formula becomes:\n$C_{f}^{\\ast} = C_{f,1} + \\frac{C_{f,1} - C_{f,2}}{3} = \\frac{3C_{f,1} + C_{f,1} - C_{f,2}}{3} = \\frac{4C_{f,1} - C_{f,2}}{3}$\nwhere $C_{f,1}$ is the fine grid value ($C_{f,\\text{f}}$) and $C_{f,2}$ is the medium grid value ($C_{f,\\text{m}}$).\n\nNow we apply this formula to both the direct and Clauser estimates.\n-   **Direct method extrapolation:**\n    $C_{f,\\text{Direct}}^{\\ast} = \\frac{4 C_{f,\\text{f,Direct}} - C_{f,\\text{m,Direct}}}{3} = \\frac{4 \\left(\\frac{1.960}{1080}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1.990}{1080}\\right)}{3} = \\frac{7.840 - 1.990}{3 \\times 1080} = \\frac{5.850}{3240}$\n    $C_{f,\\text{Direct}}^{\\ast} \\approx 0.00180555...$\n\n-   **Clauser method extrapolation:**\n    $C_{f,\\text{Clauser}}^{\\ast} = \\frac{4 C_{f,\\text{f,Clauser}} - C_{f,\\text{m,Clauser}}}{3} = \\frac{4 \\left(\\frac{1.6928}{900}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1.805}{900}\\right)}{3} = \\frac{6.7712 - 1.805}{3 \\times 900} = \\frac{4.9662}{2700}$\n    $C_{f,\\text{Clauser}}^{\\ast} \\approx 0.00183933...$\n\n4.  **Difference between extrapolated values:**\nThe final step is to compute the difference $\\Delta C_{f} = C_{f,\\text{Clauser}}^{\\ast} - C_{f,\\text{Direct}}^{\\ast}$.\n$\\Delta C_{f} = \\frac{4.9662}{2700} - \\frac{5.850}{3240}$\n$\\Delta C_{f} \\approx 0.001839333... - 0.001805555...$\n$\\Delta C_{f} \\approx 0.000033777...$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n$\\Delta C_{f} = 0.000033777... \\approx 0.00003378$.\nIn scientific notation, this is $3.378 \\times 10^{-5}$.",
