It is scientifically grounded in fluid dynamics and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The problem is well-posed, with sufficient information and clear constraints to derive a unique expression for the constant $c_{w1}$. The language is objective and precise. The problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. The solution will proceed.\n\nThe transport equation for the working variable $\\tilde{\\nu}$ in the Spalart–Allmaras model can be written as:\n$$\n\\frac{D\\tilde{\\nu}}{Dt} = c_{b1} \\tilde{S} \\tilde{\\nu} - c_{w1} f_w \\left(\\frac{\\tilde{\\nu}}{d}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{\\sigma} \\left[ \\nabla \\cdot ((\\nu+\\tilde{\\nu})\\nabla\\tilde{\\nu}) + c_{b2} |\\nabla\\tilde{\\nu}|^2 \\right]\n$$\nwhere $\\frac{D\\tilde{\\nu}}{Dt}$ is the material derivative, the first term on the right is production, the second is destruction, and the third is diffusion.\n\nWe analyze this equation in a steady, two-dimensional turbulent boundary layer along a flat plate with zero pressure gradient. For this flow, the material derivative simplifies. In the equilibrium part of the boundary layer, the state of the turbulence is self-similar when scaled by local variables, and the advection term $\\vec{u} \\cdot \\nabla\\tilde{\\nu}$ is considered negligible compared to the source and sink terms. Thus, a local equilibrium balance is assumed, which implies $\\frac{D\\tilde{\\nu}}{Dt} \\approx 0$.\n\nThe problem states we are in the logarithmic region, where high-Reynolds-number conditions apply. The simplifications are:\n1.  **Wall distance**: $d = y$.\n2.  **Model functions**: $f_w \\to 1$. Also, in the log-layer, the turbulent viscosity $\\nu_t$ is given by $\\nu_t = \\tilde{\\nu}f_{v1}$. Since $f_{v1} \\to 1$, we have $\\nu_t = \\tilde{\\nu}$.\n3.  **Production variable $\\tilde{S}$**: $\\tilde{S}$ is related to the magnitude of vorticity $S$. In the log-layer, we can approximate $\\tilde{S} \\approx S$. For a 2D boundary layer, $S = |\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}| = \\frac{dU}{dy}$. The problem gives this as $S = \\frac{u_{\\tau}}{\\kappa y}$.\n4.  **Viscosity**: The turbulent viscosity $\\nu_t$ is much larger than the molecular viscosity $\\nu$, so $\\nu+\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx \\tilde{\\nu}$.\n\nWith these assumptions, the transport equation for $\\tilde{\\nu}$ in the one-dimensional boundary layer (variations only in the $y$-direction) becomes:\n$$\n0 \\approx c_{b1} S \\tilde{\\nu} - c_{w1} \\left(\\frac{\\tilde{\\nu}}{y}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{\\sigma} \\left[ \\frac{d}{dy}\\left(\\tilde{\\nu}\\frac{d\\tilde{\\nu}}{dy}\\right) + c_{b2} \\left(\\frac{d\\tilde{\\nu}}{dy}\\right)^2 \\right]\n$$\nWe expand the diffusion term $\\frac{d}{dy}(\\tilde{\\nu}\\frac{d\\tilde{\\nu}}{dy}) = \\tilde{\\nu}\\frac{d^2\\tilde{\\nu}}{dy^2} + (\\frac{d\\tilde{\\nu}}{dy})^2$. The equation is now:\n$$\n0 \\approx c_{b1} S \\tilde{\\nu} - c_{w1} \\frac{\\tilde{\\nu}^2}{y^2} + \\frac{1}{\\sigma} \\left[ \\tilde{\\nu}\\frac{d^2\\tilde{\\nu}}{dy^2} + (1+c_{b2}) \\left(\\frac{d\\tilde{\\nu}}{dy}\\right)^2 \\right]\n$$\nTo make the model consistent with the logarithmic law of the wall, the eddy viscosity profile in this region must be $\\nu_t = \\kappa u_{\\tau} y$. Since $\\nu_t = \\tilde{\\nu}$ in the high-Re limit, we must enforce:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nu} = \\kappa u_{\\tau} y\n$$\nWe compute the derivatives of this expression with respect to $y$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\tilde{\\nu}}{dy} = \\kappa u_{\\tau}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\tilde{\\nu}}{dy^2} = 0\n$$\nNow we substitute these expressions, along with $S = u_{\\tau}/(\\kappa y)$, into the simplified transport equation:\n$$\n0 = c_{b1} \\left(\\frac{u_{\\tau}}{\\kappa y}\\right) (\\kappa u_{\\tau} y) - c_{w1} \\frac{(\\kappa u_{\\tau} y)^2}{y^2} + \\frac{1}{\\sigma} \\left[ (\\kappa u_{\\tau} y)(0) + (1+c_{b2}) (\\kappa u_{\\tau})^2 \\right]\n$$\nSimplifying the terms:\n$$\n0 = c_{b1} u_{\\tau}^2 - c_{w1} \\frac{\\kappa^2 u_{\\tau}^2 y^2}{y^2} + \\frac{1}{\\sigma} (1+c_{b2}) \\kappa^2 u_{\\tau}^2\n$$\n$$\n0 = c_{b1} u_{\\tau}^2 - c_{w1} \\kappa^2 u_{\\tau}^2 + \\frac{\\kappa^2 (1+c_{b2})}{\\sigma} u_{\\tau}^2\n$$\nSince $u_{\\tau} \\neq 0$, we can divide the entire equation by $u_{\\tau}^2$:\n$$\n0 = c_{b1} - c_{w1} \\kappa^2 + \\frac{\\kappa^2 (1+c_{b2})}{\\sigma}\n$$\nSolving for $c_{w1}$:\n$$\nc_{w1} \\kappa^2 = c_{b1} + \\frac{\\kappa^2 (1+c_{b2})}{\\sigma}\n$$\n$$\nc_{w1} = \\frac{c_{b1}}{\\kappa^2} + \\frac{1+c_{b2}}{\\sigma}\n$$\nThis is the derived expression for $c_{w1}$ that ensures consistency with the logarithmic law of the wall.\n\nThe problem then asks for the standard values for the constants in the original SA model. These are empirically determined and are given as:\n- $\\kappa = 0.41$\n- $\\sigma = 2/3$\n- $c_{b1} = 0.1355$\n- $c_{b2} = 0.622$\n- $c_{v1} = 7.1$\n- $c_{w2} = 0.3$\n- $c_{w3} = 2.0$\n\nFinally, we evaluate $c_{w1}$ using the provided values: $\\kappa=0.41$, $\\sigma=2/3$, $c_{b1}=0.1355$, and $c_{b2}=0.622$.\n$$\nc_{w1} = \\frac{0.1355}{(0.41)^2} + \\frac{1+0.622}{2/3}\n$$\n$$\nc_{w1} = \\frac{0.1355}{0.1681} + \\frac{1.622}{2/3}\n$$\n$$\nc_{w1} = 0.80606781677... + 1.622 \\times \\frac{3}{2}\n$$\n$$\nc_{w1} = 0.80606781677... + 2.433\n$$\n$$\nc_{w1} = 3.23906781677...\n$$\nRounding the result to $4$ significant figures, we get $3.239$.",

The transport equation for the modified eddy viscosity, $\\tilde{\\nu}$, under the specified assumptions of homogeneous turbulence (negligible spatial gradients of turbulence quantities), negligible diffusion, and negligible destruction, simplifies significantly. The general SA equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{D\\tilde{\\nu}}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial\\tilde{\\nu}}{\\partial t} + U_j \\frac{\\partial\\tilde{\\nu}}{\\partial x_j} = P - D + T\n$$\nFor homogeneous turbulence, the convective term $U_j \\frac{\\partial\\tilde{\\nu}}{\\partial x_j}$ is zero.

The initial turbulent kinetic energy is $k_0 = \\frac{1}{2}(\\overline{u_1'(0)^2} + \\overline{u_2'(0)^2} + \\overline{u_3'(0)^2}) = \\frac{3}{2}\\overline{u_1'(0)^2}$.

Thus, the initial Reynolds stress tensor is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{R}(0) = \\frac{2}{3} k_0 \\mathbf{I}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix.\nThe evolution of the Reynolds stress tensor under RDT for a constant mean velocity gradient $\\mathbf{A}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{R}(t) = e^{\\mathbf{A} t} \\mathbf{R}(0) e^{\\mathbf{A}^\\top t}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\mathbf{R}(0)$ and noting that the given $\\mathbf{A}$ is symmetric ($\\mathbf{A}^\\top = \\mathbf{A}$), we have:\n$$\n\\mathbf{R}(t) = e^{\\mathbf{A} t} \\left(\\frac{2}{3} k_0 \\mathbf{I}\\right) e^{\\mathbf{A} t} = \\frac{2}{3} k_0 e^{\\mathbf{A} t} e^{\\mathbf{A} t} = \\frac{2}{3} k_0 e^{2\\mathbf{A} t}\n$$\nThe tensor $\\mathbf{A}$ is $\\mathbf{A} = \\mathrm{diag}(a, -a, 0)$. Therefore, $2\\mathbf{A}t = \\mathrm{diag}(2at, -2at, 0)$. The matrix exponential of a diagonal matrix is the diagonal matrix of the exponentials of its elements:\n$$\ne^{2\\mathbf{A} t} = \\begin{pmatrix} e^{2at} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & e^{-2at} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & e^{0} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} e^{2at} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & e^{-2at} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe Reynolds stress tensor at time $t$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{R}(t) = \\frac{2}{3} k_0 \\begin{pmatrix} e^{2at} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & e^{-2at} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe turbulent kinetic energy at time $t$ is the trace of $\\mathbf{R}(t)$ divided by $2$:\n$$\nk(t) = \\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{R}(t)) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{2}{3} k_0 (e^{2at} + e^{-2at} + 1) \\right] = \\frac{k_0}{3} (e^{2at} + e^{-2at} + 1)\n$$\nThe RDT amplification factor is the ratio $k(t)/k_0$:\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{RDT}}(t) = \\frac{k(t)}{k_0} = \\frac{1}{3} (e^{2at} + e^{-2at} + 1)\n$$\nUsing the definition of the hyperbolic cosine, $\\cosh(x) = \\frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2}$, we can write this as:\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{RDT}}(t) = \\frac{1}{3} (2\\cosh(2at) + 1)\n$$\nFinally, we compute the deviation $\\Delta(a,t)$:\n$$\n\\Delta(a,t) = A_{\\mathrm{SA}}(t) - A_{\\mathrm{RDT}}(t) = 1 - \\frac{1}{3} (2\\cosh(2at) + 1)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta(a,t) = 1 - \\frac{2}{3}\\cosh(2at) - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3} - \\frac{2}{3}\\cosh(2at)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta(a,t) = \\frac{2}{3} (1 - \\cosh(2at))\n$$",
