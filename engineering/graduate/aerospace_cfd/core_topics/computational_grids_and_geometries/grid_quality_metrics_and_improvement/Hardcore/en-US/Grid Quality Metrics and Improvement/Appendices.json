The derived expression $y = y^{+}_{\\mathrm{t}} \\nu_{w} \\sqrt{\\rho_{w} / \\tau_{w}}$ shows that $y$ is inversely proportional to the square root of the wall shear stress, i.e., $y \\propto \\tau_{w}^{-1/2}$. This inverse relationship has significant implications for grid generation in transonic wing simulations. Transonic flows are characterized by regions of rapid acceleration and deceleration, often involving shock waves. The wall shear stress, $\\tau_{w}$, varies dramatically along the wing chord. It is typically high near the leading edge and in regions of strong flow acceleration, and it drops sharply across a shock wave, especially in a shock-induced boundary-layer interaction, potentially leading to separation where $\\tau_{w}$ approaches zero. Due to the $y \\propto \\tau_{w}^{-1/2}$ dependency, regions of high $\\tau_{w}$ require a much smaller first cell height $y$ to maintain a target $y^{+}$ (e.g., $y^{+} \\approx 1$ for a wall-resolved simulation) compared to regions of low $\\tau_{w}$. Therefore, an accurate a priori estimation of the maximum $\\tau_{w}$ on the surface is critical for designing a suitable grid. Underestimating $\\tau_{w}$ would lead to a grid that is too coarse ($y$ too large), resulting in $y^{+}$ values that are too high and a failure to resolve the viscous sublayer. Overestimating $\\tau_{w}$ leads to an unnecessarily fine grid ($y$ too small), which significantly increases computational cost.",

The provided values are physically realistic for typical CFD applications in aerospace. The problem is not trivial, as it requires a derivation and a logical argument about the solution's properties.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Algebraic Equation for $r$\n\nThe total thickness $\\delta$ of the boundary-layer mesh is the sum of the heights of the $N$ individual layers.\n$$ \\delta = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} y_k $$\nSubstituting the given definition for the height of the $k$-th layer, $y_k = y_1 r^{k-1}$, we get:\n$$ \\delta = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} y_1 r^{k-1} $$\nWe can factor out the constant first-layer height $y_1$:\n$$ \\delta = y_1 \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{N} r^{k-1} \\right) $$\nThe sum is a finite geometric series:\n$$ S_N = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} r^{k-1} = r^0 + r^1 + r^2 + \\dots + r^{N-1} = 1 + r + r^2 + \\dots + r^{N-1} $$\nAs required, we derive the closed-form expression for this sum from first principles. Multiply the series $S_N$ by $r$:\n$$ r S_N = r(1 + r + r^2 + \\dots + r^{N-1}) = r + r^2 + r^3 + \\dots + r^N $$\nSubtract the original series $S_N$ from $r S_N$:\n$$ r S_N - S_N = (r + r^2 + r^3 + \\dots + r^N) - (1 + r + r^2 + \\dots + r^{N-1}) $$\nMost terms on the right-hand side cancel, leaving:\n$$ S_N (r - 1) = r^N - 1 $$\nThe problem states that $r  1$, which implies $r \\neq 1$. Therefore, we can divide by $(r-1)$:\n$$ S_N = \\frac{r^N - 1}{r - 1} $$\nSubstituting this closed-form sum back into the equation for $\\delta$:\n$$ \\delta = y_1 \\left( \\frac{r^N - 1}{r - 1} \\right) $$\nThis is the algebraic equation that the growth ratio $r$ must satisfy for given values of $N$, $y_1$, and $\\delta$. It can be rearranged as:\n$$ \\frac{\\delta}{y_1} = \\frac{r^N - 1}{r - 1} $$\n\n### Existence and Uniqueness of a Physically Acceptable Solution\n\nA physically acceptable solution must satisfy the constraint $r  1$. We need to show that for any valid set of physical parameters, there exists a unique solution for $r$ in the interval $(1, \\infty)$.\n\nLet's define a function $f(r)$ for $r  1$:\n$$ f(r) = \\frac{r^N - 1}{r - 1} = 1 + r + r^2 + \\dots + r^{N-1} $$\nThe equation to be solved for $r$ is $f(r) = \\frac{\\delta}{y_1}$.\n\nFor the physical problem to be meaningful, the total thickness $\\delta$ must be greater than the thickness of $N$ layers all having the minimum height $y_1$. That is, $\\delta  N y_1$, which implies the target value $\\frac{\\delta}{y_1}  N$.\n\n**Existence:**\nThe function $f(r)$ is a polynomial in $r$, so it is continuous for all real $r$.\nLet's evaluate $f(r)$ at the lower bound of our interval of interest, $r=1$. Using the polynomial form, $f(1) = 1 + 1^1 + \\dots + 1^{N-1} = N$.\nThe derivative of $f(r)$ with respect to $r$ is:\n$$ f'(r) = \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( 1 + r + r^2 + \\dots + r^{N-1} \\right) = 0 + 1 + 2r + \\dots + (N-1)r^{N-2} $$\nFor $r  1$, all terms in the sum for $f'(r)$ are positive (for $N1$), so $f'(r)  0$. This means $f(r)$ is a strictly monotonically increasing function on the interval $(1, \\infty)$.\nAs $r \\to \\infty$, the term $r^{N-1}$ dominates, and $f(r) \\to \\infty$.\nWe have a continuous function $f(r)$ that starts at $f(1)=N$ and increases without bound. The target value for our equation is $\\frac{\\delta}{y_1}$, which we established must be greater than $N$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, for any value $C  N$, there must exist at least one $r \\in (1, \\infty)$ such that $f(r) = C$. Since $\\frac{\\delta}{y_1}  N$, a solution for $r1$ is guaranteed to exist.\n\n**Uniqueness:**\nAs established, the derivative $f'(r)  0$ for all $r  1$. A function that is strictly increasing on an interval can take on any specific value at most once within that interval. Therefore, the solution $r$ to the equation $f(r) = \\frac{\\delta}{y_1}$ is unique for $r  1$.\n\n### Calculation of $r$ for the Specific Design\n\nWe are given the following parameters:\n- Number of layers: $N = 4$\n- First-layer height: $y_1 = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n- Total thickness: $\\delta = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n\nFirst, we compute the ratio $\\frac{\\delta}{y_1}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\delta}{y_1} = \\frac{1.5}{0.1} = 15 $$\nNow, we substitute $N=4$ and $\\frac{\\delta}{y_1}=15$ into the derived algebraic equation:\n$$ \\frac{r^4 - 1}{r - 1} = 15 $$\nUsing the polynomial expansion of the left side:\n$$ 1 + r + r^2 + r^3 = 15 $$\nRearranging this into a standard cubic polynomial form gives:\n$$ r^3 + r^2 + r - 14 = 0 $$\nTo find the roots of this cubic equation, we test for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. Potential rational roots must be divisors of the constant term $-14$. Since we seek a physical solution with $r1$, we only need to test the positive divisors of $14$, which are $1$, $2$, $7$, and $14$.\nLet $P(r) = r^3 + r^2 + r - 14$.\n- Test $r=1$: $P(1) = 1^3 + 1^2 + 1 - 14 = 1+1+1-14 = -11 \\neq 0$.\n- Test $r=2$: $P(2) = 2^3 + 2^2 + 2 - 14 = 8+4+2-14 = 14-14 = 0$.\nThus, $r=2$ is a root of the polynomial.\nBased on our uniqueness argument, this must be the only physically acceptable solution. To confirm this, we can factor the polynomial. Since $r=2$ is a root, $(r-2)$ is a factor. We perform polynomial division:\n$$ \\frac{r^3 + r^2 + r - 14}{r - 2} = r^2 + 3r + 7 $$\nSo, the polynomial is factored as:\n$$ (r-2)(r^2 + 3r + 7) = 0 $$\nThe other potential roots come from the quadratic factor $r^2 + 3r + 7 = 0$. The discriminant $\\Delta$ of this quadratic equation is:\n$$ \\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 3^2 - 4(1)(7) = 9 - 28 = -19 $$\nSince the discriminant is negative ($\\Delta  0$), the roots of the quadratic factor are a complex conjugate pair, not real numbers. Therefore, the only real root of the cubic equation is $r=2$. This solution satisfies the condition $r1$ and is the unique, exact, physically acceptable growth ratio.",

The derivation of $p$ assumes that the discretization error is dominated by a single leading term, i.e., $E(h) = Q(h) - Q_{\\infty} \\approx C h^p$. This is only true when the grid is sufficiently refined such that the solution is in the \"asymptotic range\" of convergence. The calculated value $p \\approx 1.485$, which is substantially less than $2$, indicates that the solutions are not yet in the asymptotic range. The error is contaminated by higher-order terms from the truncation error series, $E(h) = C_1 h^{p_1} + C_2 h^{p_2} + \\dots$, where $p_1$ is the formal order. When grids are not sufficiently fine, the contributions from terms like $C_2 h^{p_2}$ are not negligible, and the three-point formula calculates an \"apparent\" order that is some combination of the effects of multiple terms, which will generally not be an integer. This can be caused by two main factors:\n1. Overall insufficient grid resolution: The coarsest grid, $h_1$, may be too coarse to resolve the basic flow physics, rendering the asymptotic assumption invalid.\n2. Localized grid quality issues: Even on a globally fine grid, local deficiencies can contaminate the solution. Poor grid quality metrics, such as high cell skewness, large aspect ratios, or abrupt changes in cell volume, can degrade the actual order of accuracy of the scheme. Furthermore, for a transonic flow problem, physical phenomena such as shock waves or stagnation points create sharp gradients or singularities. If the grid is not adequately refined or aligned to resolve these features, the local truncation error can be very large and not conform to the simple power-law decay, thus polluting the global convergence behavior.\n\nOne concrete grid improvement strategy to increase the observed order toward the formal order of $p=2$ is **solution-adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)**. This strategy focuses on improving grid quality locally and efficiently, rather than through expensive uniform refinement. The procedure is as follows:\n1. An initial solution is obtained on a relatively coarse grid.\n2. An error indicator is computed throughout the domain. This indicator is a heuristic designed to estimate regions of high discretization error. For transonic aerodynamics, a common and effective indicator is the gradient of a key flow variable, such as pressure ($\\nabla p$) or Mach number ($\\nabla M$), as these gradients are largest at shock waves and other critical features.\n3. Cells where the error indicator exceeds a specified threshold are flagged for refinement.\n4. The flagged cells are subdivided, creating a new, locally denser grid. The solution can then be recomputed on this adapted grid.\nBy selectively adding grid points in regions of high error, such as the vicinity of the shock wave, the leading-edge stagnation point, and the boundary layer, AMR effectively reduces the dominant, localized error sources that were preventing the solution from entering the asymptotic range. With these features better resolved, the remaining global error is more likely to be dominated by the designed $O(h^2)$ truncation error of the solver, leading to an observed order of accuracy $p$ that approaches the theoretical value of $2$ in a subsequent grid convergence study.",
