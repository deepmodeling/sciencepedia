The final answer must be a row matrix $(\\kappa_{\\text{eff}},\\,R_{s})$.\n\n#### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on fundamental principles of electrochemistry and transport phenomena in porous media. The use of Ohm's law for ionic conduction, the concept of effective medium theory, and the parameters of porosity and tortuosity (encapsulated in $\\beta$) are all standard and well-established in the modeling of batteries and other electrochemical systems. The given value $\\beta=1.5$ corresponds to the classical Bruggeman model, which is widely used. The problem is firmly grounded in established science.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly stated.

The calculations are straightforward and feasible.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. A full solution will now be developed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution will be developed in three parts as requested: derivation of the effective conductivity scaling, derivation of the sheet resistance, and numerical computation.\n\n#### Part 1: Derivation of effective conductivity $\\kappa_{\\text{eff}}$\nIn a porous medium saturated with an ion-conducting electrolyte, the effective conductivity $\\kappa_{\\text{eff}}$ is lower than the bulk electrolyte conductivity $\\kappa$. This reduction is attributable to two primary geometric effects:\n1.  **Reduced Conductive Volume:** The solid matrix of the separator is non-conductive. The ionic current is confined to the pore space occupied by the electrolyte. The fraction of the total volume available for conduction is the porosity, $\\varepsilon$. This effect, in a simple approximation, reduces the effective cross-sectional area for conduction by a factor of $\\varepsilon$.\n2.  **Increased Path Length (Tortuosity):** The ions cannot travel in a straight line through the separator; they must follow the tortuous, winding paths of the interconnected pores. This increases the effective path length compared to the macroscopic thickness of the medium.\n\nA general and widely accepted scaling law that combines these effects is the Bruggeman relation. It follows from volume-averaging theories for transport in random heterogeneous media. The relation connects the effective property to the bulk property and the volume fraction of the conducting phase, $\\varepsilon$, via a scaling exponent, $\\beta$. The exponent $\\beta$ is a phenomenological parameter that encapsulates the complex geometric-topological features of the pore structure, such as tortuosity and constrictivity. The relationship is given by:\n$$\n\\kappa_{\\text{eff}} = \\kappa \\varepsilon^{\\beta}\n$$\nThis is the physically justified scaling relationship requested. The value $\\beta=1.5$ given in the problem is the classical value derived by Bruggeman for a medium containing a random dispersion of insulating spherical particles.\n\n#### Part 2: Derivation of sheet resistance $R_s$\nThe resistance of the separator sheet, denoted $R_s$, can be derived from the macroscopic form of Ohm's law. The effective current density $\\mathbf{i}_{\\text{eff}}$ is related to the macroscopic potential field $\\Phi$ by the constitutive relation:\n$$\n\\mathbf{i}_{\\text{eff}} = -\\kappa_{\\text{eff}} \\nabla\\Phi\n$$\nWe consider a separator sheet of uniform thickness $L$ and cross-sectional area $A$, positioned between two parallel equipotential faces. The potential difference between these faces is $\\Delta\\Phi$. Assuming a uniform current flow perpendicular to the faces (along the $z$-axis, for instance), the potential gradient is constant and its magnitude is given by $|\\nabla\\Phi| = \\frac{\\Delta\\Phi}{L}$. The current density is also uniform, with magnitude $i_{\\text{eff}} = \\kappa_{\\text{eff}} \\frac{\\Delta\\Phi}{L}$.\n\nThe total ionic current $I$ passing through the separator is the product of the current density and the cross-sectional area $A$:\n$$\nI = i_{\\text{eff}} A = \\left(\\kappa_{\\text{eff}} \\frac{\\Delta\\Phi}{L}\\right) A\n$$\nBy definition, electrical resistance $R$ is the ratio of the potential difference to the total current, $R = \\frac{\\Delta\\Phi}{I}$. Using this definition for the sheet resistance $R_s$:\n$$\nR_s = \\frac{\\Delta\\Phi}{I} = \\frac{\\Delta\\Phi}{\\left(\\kappa_{\\text{eff}} \\frac{\\Delta\\Phi}{L}\\right) A}\n$$\nSimplifying this expression yields the desired formula for the resistance of the separator sheet:\n$$\nR_s = \\frac{L}{\\kappa_{\\text{eff}} A}\n$$\nThis expression is analogous to the standard formula for the resistance of a conductor with resistivity $\\rho = 1/\\kappa_{\\text{eff}}$. The term \"sheet resistance\" in this context refers to the total DC ionic resistance of the specified component, not the material property typically quoted in units of $\\Omega/\\text{square}$.\n\n#### Part 3: Numerical Computation\nWe are given the following values:\n$\\varepsilon=0.35$ (dimensionless)\n$\\beta=1.5$ (dimensionless)\n$\\kappa=1.2\\,\\text{S}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$\n$L=25\\,\\mu\\text{m}$\n$A=10\\,\\text{cm}^{2}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the effective conductivity $\\kappa_{\\text{eff}}$:\n$$\n\\kappa_{\\text{eff}} = \\kappa \\varepsilon^{\\beta} = (1.2\\,\\text{S}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}) \\times (0.35)^{1.5}\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\n(0.35)^{1.5} \\approx 0.20706279\n$$\n$$\n\\kappa_{\\text{eff}} \\approx 1.2 \\times 0.20706279 \\approx 0.24847535\\,\\text{S}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\n\\kappa_{\\text{eff}} \\approx 0.2485\\,\\text{S}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the sheet resistance $R_s$. It is imperative to first convert all geometric parameters to SI units (meters).\nThe thickness $L$ is:\n$$\nL = 25\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 25 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}\n$$\nThe area $A$ is:\n$$\nA = 10\\,\\text{cm}^{2} = 10 \\times (10^{-2}\\,\\text{m})^{2} = 10 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{m}^{2} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}^{2}\n$$\nNow we compute $R_s$ using the unrounded value of $\\kappa_{\\text{eff}}$ for accuracy:\n$$\nR_s = \\frac{L}{\\kappa_{\\text{eff}} A} = \\frac{25 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}}{(0.24847535\\,\\text{S}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}^{2})}\n$$\nThe units are $\\frac{\\text{m}}{(\\text{S}\\,\\text{m}^{-1})\\,\\text{m}^2} = \\frac{1}{\\text{S}} = \\Omega$, which is correct for resistance.\n$$\nR_s = \\frac{25 \\times 10^{-6}}{0.24847535 \\times 10^{-3}}\\,\\Omega = \\frac{25}{0.24847535} \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\Omega \\approx 100.6136 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\Omega\n$$\n$$\nR_s \\approx 0.1006136\\,\\Omega\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we obtain:\n$$\nR_s \\approx 0.1006\\,\\Omega\n$$\nThe final results are $\\kappa_{\\text{eff}} \\approx 0.2485\\,\\text{S}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$ and $R_s \\approx 0.1006\\,\\Omega$.",
