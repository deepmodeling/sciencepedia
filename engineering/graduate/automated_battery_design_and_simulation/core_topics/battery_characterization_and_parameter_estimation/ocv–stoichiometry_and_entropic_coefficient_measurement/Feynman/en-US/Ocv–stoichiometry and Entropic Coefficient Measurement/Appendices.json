            "problem": "A lithium-ion half-cell is prepared to measure the Open-Circuit Voltage (OCV)–stoichiometry relation and the entropic coefficient, defined as the temperature derivative of OCV, $\\partial U/\\partial T$, at a fixed stoichiometry. To ensure that both the OCV reading and its temperature dependence reflect thermodynamic equilibrium, the electrode is allowed to rest after stopping a small conditioning current and after applying a small temperature step, under open-circuit conditions. The composite electrode is modeled as an ensemble of spherical active material particles of radius $L$, each governed by Fickian solid-state diffusion with a constant diffusivity $D$ at the target stoichiometry.

The parameters provided are physically realistic for lithium-ion battery materials.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides sufficient information to determine a unique solution. The governing equations, boundary conditions, and relaxation criteria are clearly specified. The assumption to use the slowest eigenmode resolves potential ambiguity in defining the \"residual deviation from uniform concentration\".\n- **Objective:** The problem statement is expressed in precise, objective language without subjective or opinion-based claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe minimum rest time, $t_{\\mathrm{rest}}$, must be sufficient for both concentration and thermal relaxation to meet the specified criterion. This means $t_{\\mathrm{rest}}$ must be the greater of the two individual relaxation times, $t_{\\mathrm{conc}}$ and $t_{\\mathrm{therm}}$.\n$t_{\\mathrm{rest}} = \\max(t_{\\mathrm{conc}}, t_{\\mathrm{therm}})$.\n\n**1. Concentration Relaxation Time ($t_{\\mathrm{conc}}$)**\n\nThe relaxation of the concentration field, $c(r, t)$, inside a spherical particle of radius $L$ is governed by Fick's second law in spherical coordinates:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = D \\nabla^2 c = D \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r^2 \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial r} \\right) $$\nThe boundary conditions are zero flux at the center (due to symmetry) and at the surface (due to open-circuit conditions):\n$$ \\left. \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial r} \\right|_{r=0} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\left. \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial r} \\right|_{r=L} = 0 $$\nThe solution to this partial differential equation can be found by separation of variables. The concentration deviation from the final uniform equilibrium concentration, $\\Delta c(r, t) = c(r, t) - c_{\\infty}$, can be expressed as an infinite series of decaying eigenmodes. The problem states that relaxation is dominated by the slowest non-zero eigenmode.\n\nThe spatial part of the solution involves solving for the eigenvalues $\\lambda_n$ that satisfy the boundary conditions. For the given boundary conditions, the eigenvalues are the roots of the transcendental equation:\n$$ \\tan(\\lambda_n L) = \\lambda_n L $$\nLet $\\mu_n = \\lambda_n L$. The equation is $\\tan(\\mu_n) = \\mu_n$. The $n=0$ solution, $\\mu_0=0$, corresponds to the uniform steady-state concentration. The slowest non-zero decay mode corresponds to the smallest positive root, $\\mu_1$. Numerically, $\\mu_1 \\approx 4.4934$.\n\nThe time-dependent part of this slowest mode decays exponentially with a characteristic time constant $\\tau_{\\mathrm{diff}}$:\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{diff}} = \\frac{1}{D \\lambda_1^2} = \\frac{L^2}{D \\mu_1^2} $$\nThe deviation from equilibrium, which is proportional to this mode, decays as $\\exp(-t/\\tau_{\\mathrm{diff}})$. The condition is that the residual deviation at time $t_{\\mathrm{conc}}$ is a fraction $(1-f)$ of the initial deviation:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta c(t_{\\mathrm{conc}})}{\\Delta c(0)} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\mathrm{conc}}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{diff}}}\\right) = 1 - f $$\nSolving for $t_{\\mathrm{conc}}$:\n$$ -\\frac{t_{\\mathrm{conc}}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{diff}}} = \\ln(1-f) $$\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{conc}} = - \\tau_{\\mathrm{diff}} \\ln(1-f) = -\\frac{L^2}{D \\mu_1^2} \\ln(1-f) $$\n\n**2. Thermal Relaxation Time ($t_{\\mathrm{therm}}$)**\n\nThe temperature of the cell, $T(t)$, is modeled as a lumped system relaxing according to Newton's law of cooling, which is a first-order process with a given time constant $\\tau_{\\mathrm{th}}$. The deviation from the final temperature, $\\Delta T(t) = T(t) - T_{f}$, follows the equation:\n$$ \\frac{d(\\Delta T)}{dt} = -\\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{th}}} \\Delta T $$\nThe solution is $\\Delta T(t) = \\Delta T(0) \\exp(-t/\\tau_{\\mathrm{th}})$. The condition for thermal relaxation is analogous to the concentration case:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta T(t_{\\mathrm{therm}})}{\\Delta T(0)} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\mathrm{therm}}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{th}}}\\right) = 1-f $$\nSolving for $t_{\\mathrm{therm}}$:\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{therm}} = -\\tau_{\\mathrm{th}} \\ln(1-f) $$\n\n**3. Calculation of Minimum Rest Time ($t_{\\mathrm{rest}}$)**\n\nFirst, we compare the characteristic time constants $\\tau_{\\mathrm{diff}}$ and $\\tau_{\\mathrm{th}}$.\nGiven values:\n$L = 4.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n$D = 5.0 \\times 10^{-15}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}}$\n$\\tau_{\\mathrm{th}} = 600\\ \\mathrm{s}$\n$\\mu_1^2 \\approx (4.4934)^2 \\approx 20.1907$\n\nThe diffusion time constant is:\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{diff}} = \\frac{L^2}{D \\mu_1^2} = \\frac{(4.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m})^2}{(5.0 \\times 10^{-15}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}})(20.1907)} = \\frac{1.6 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{m^2}}{1.0095 \\times 10^{-13}\\ \\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}} \\approx 158.5\\ \\mathrm{s} $$\nComparing the time constants:\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{diff}} \\approx 158.5\\ \\mathrm{s} \\quad  \\quad \\tau_{\\mathrm{th}} = 600\\ \\mathrm{s} $$\nSince $\\tau_{\\mathrm{th}} > \\tau_{\\mathrm{diff}}$, the thermal relaxation is the slower process and thus dictates the minimum rest time.\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{rest}} = t_{\\mathrm{therm}} = -\\tau_{\\mathrm{th}} \\ln(1-f) $$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values for $\\tau_{\\mathrm{th}}$ and $f$:\n$f = 0.995$, so $1-f = 0.005$.\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{rest}} = - (600\\ \\mathrm{s}) \\ln(0.005) \\approx - (600\\ \\mathrm{s})(-5.298317) \\approx 3178.99\\ \\mathrm{s} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $3180\\ \\mathrm{s}$.\n\n### Justification\nThe calculation shows that the characteristic time for thermal relaxation ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{th}} = 600\\ \\mathrm{s}$) is significantly longer than the characteristic time for intra-particle concentration relaxation ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{diff}} \\approx 158.5\\ \\mathrm{s}$). Therefore, the overall equilibration of the half-cell is rate-limited by heat transfer, not mass transfer within the active material particles. The measurement of the entropic coefficient, $\\partial U/\\partial T$, involves measuring the change in OCV ($U$) in response to a small, controlled change in temperature ($T$). For this measurement to reflect a true thermodynamic property, the cell must be at thermal equilibrium at each temperature setpoint. Since the thermal relaxation is the dominant (slowest) process, the minimum rest time must be determined by the time required for the cell's temperature to stabilize. The concentration gradients will have relaxed to the required degree well within this timeframe. Consequently, the thermal dynamics of the experimental setup are the dominant constraint for this measurement.",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains all necessary information and consistent constraints to determine the required design parameters.\n\nThe solution is partitioned into two tasks as specified in the problem statement.\n\n### Part 1: Sensor Resolution Specification\n\nThe first task is to determine the minimum required resolution for the voltage and temperature sensors. The problem defines \"minimum resolution\" as the largest acceptable quantization step size ($\\delta_U$ for voltage, $\\delta_T$ for temperature) that ensures the quantization error is negligible. The provided criteria are:\n1. Voltage quantization step: $\\delta_U \\leq 0.01 \\times \\alpha_{\\text{true}} \\Delta T$\n2. Temperature quantization step: $\\delta_T \\leq 0.01 \\times \\Delta T$\n\nWe will calculate the boundary values for these inequalities.\n\nFor the voltage sensor resolution, $\\delta_U$:\nThe signal increment for voltage is the expected change in Open-Circuit Voltage (OCV), $\\Delta U_{\\text{expected}} \\approx \\alpha_{\\text{true}} \\Delta T$.\nThe required constraint on the voltage quantization step is:\n$$ \\delta_U \\leq 0.01 \\times \\alpha_{\\text{true}} \\Delta T $$\nSubstituting the given values $\\alpha_{\\text{true}} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{V/K}$ and $\\Delta T = 0.500 \\, \\mathrm{K}$:\n$$ \\delta_U \\leq 0.01 \\times (1.00 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{V/K}) \\times (0.500 \\, \\mathrm{K}) $$\n$$ \\delta_U \\leq 5.00 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\mathrm{V} $$\nTo report this value in microvolts ($\\mathrm{\\mu V}$), we convert units:\n$$ \\delta_U \\leq (5.00 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\mathrm{V}) \\times \\left(\\frac{10^6 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{V}}{1 \\, \\mathrm{V}}\\right) = 5.00 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{V} $$\nThus, the maximum permissible quantization step for the voltage sensor is $5.00 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nFor the temperature sensor resolution, $\\delta_T$:\nThe signal increment for temperature is simply the temperature step, $\\Delta T$.\nThe required constraint on the temperature quantization step is:\n$$ \\delta_T \\leq 0.01 \\times \\Delta T $$\nSubstituting the given value $\\Delta T = 0.500 \\, \\mathrm{K}$:\n$$ \\delta_T \\leq 0.01 \\times (0.500 \\, \\mathrm{K}) = 5.00 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{K} $$\nTo report this value in millikelvins ($\\mathrm{mK}$), we convert units:\n$$ \\delta_T \\leq (5.00 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{K}) \\times \\left(\\frac{10^3 \\, \\mathrm{mK}}{1 \\, \\mathrm{K}}\\right) = 5.00 \\, \\mathrm{mK} $$\nThus, the maximum permissible quantization step for the temperature sensor is $5.00 \\, \\mathrm{mK}$.\n\n### Part 2: Averaging Time Calculation\n\nThe second task is to compute the minimum averaging time $\\tau$ required to meet the confidence interval specification for the entropic coefficient estimator, $\\hat{\\alpha}$.\n\nFirst, we determine the variance of a single voltage or temperature measurement after averaging over time $\\tau$. For a white noise source with amplitude spectral density $N$ and an ideal rectangular averaging filter of duration $\\tau$, the equivalent noise bandwidth is $B = \\frac{1}{2\\tau}$. The variance $\\sigma^2$ of the measurement is given by $\\sigma^2 = N^2 B$.\n\nThe variance of a single voltage measurement $U_i$ is:\n$$ \\sigma_U^2 = N_v^2 B = \\frac{N_v^2}{2\\tau} $$\nThe variance of a single temperature measurement $T_i$ is:\n$$ \\sigma_T^2 = N_T^2 B = \\frac{N_T^2}{2\\tau} $$\n\nThe entropic coefficient estimator $\\hat{\\alpha}$ is a ratio of differences: $\\hat{\\alpha} = \\frac{\\Delta U}{\\Delta T} = \\frac{U_2 - U_1}{T_2 - T_1}$. The four measurements ($U_1$, $U_2$, $T_1$, $T_2$) are independent. The variance of the difference $\\Delta U = U_2 - U_1$ is the sum of the variances of $U_1$ and $U_2$:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\Delta U}^2 = \\mathrm{Var}(U_2 - U_1) = \\mathrm{Var}(U_2) + \\mathrm{Var}(U_1) = \\sigma_U^2 + \\sigma_U^2 = 2\\sigma_U^2 = \\frac{N_v^2}{\\tau} $$\nSimilarly, the variance of the difference $\\Delta T = T_2 - T_1$ is:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\Delta T}^2 = \\mathrm{Var}(T_2 - T_1) = \\mathrm{Var}(T_2) + \\mathrm{Var}(T_1) = \\sigma_T^2 + \\sigma_T^2 = 2\\sigma_T^2 = \\frac{N_T^2}{\\tau} $$\n\nNext, we use first-order propagation of uncertainty to find the variance of the estimator $\\hat{\\alpha}$.

For a Gaussian-distributed estimator, the half-width is $W = z \\sigma_{\\hat{\\alpha}}$, where $z$ is the z-score corresponding to the confidence level. For a $95\\%$ two-sided CI, the cumulative probability is $1 - (1-0.95)/2 = 0.975$, for which the z-score is $z \\approx 1.96$.\nThe requirement is:\n$$ W = 1.96 \\, \\sigma_{\\hat{\\alpha}} \\leq 0.10 \\, \\alpha_{\\text{true}} $$\nThis implies an upper bound on the standard deviation:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\hat{\\alpha}} \\leq \\frac{0.10 \\, \\alpha_{\\text{true}}}{1.96} $$\nSquaring both sides gives the condition for the variance:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\hat{\\alpha}}^2 \\leq \\left(\\frac{0.10 \\, \\alpha_{\\text{true}}}{1.96}\\right)^2 $$\nSubstituting our expression for $\\sigma_{\\hat{\\alpha}}^2$:\n$$ \\frac{N_v^2 + \\alpha_{\\text{true}}^2 N_T^2}{\\tau (\\Delta T)^2} \\leq \\left(\\frac{0.10 \\, \\alpha_{\\text{true}}}{1.96}\\right)^2 $$\nTo satisfy this inequality, the averaging time $\\tau$ must be greater than or equal to a minimum value.

The entropic coefficient is the temperature derivative of the OCV at fixed stoichiometry, $(\\partial U/\\partial T)_{x}$.\n\nTo stabilize the measurement near open-circuit without full relaxation, the platform employs a microcurrent control of magnitude $I_{m}$ (a constant, nonzero current so small that internal polarization is negligible to first order) while recording the apparent voltage at the instrument binding posts, $V_{\\mathrm{meas}}(x,T)$. The instrument-to-cell connection uses two current-carrying leads with finite lead resistance $R_{l}(T)$ each and a finite contact resistance $R_{c}(T)$ at the cell terminal. The leads are dissimilar from the cell tab metals, so there is a thermoelectric (Seebeck) offset $V_{S}(T)$ associated with the metal junctions and temperature gradients.\n\nStarting only from fundamental laws and core definitions:\n- Ohm’s law ($V=IR$) for series resistive drops,\n- The Seebeck effect ($V_{S}=\\int S\\,\\mathrm{d}T$ for a thermocouple path, where $S$ is the Seebeck coefficient),\n- The definition of OCV $U(x,T)$ and the entropic coefficient $(\\partial U/\\partial T)_{x}$,\n\nperform the following:\n\n1. Derive, to first order in $I_{m}$, a symbolic expression for the apparent two-terminal measured voltage $V_{\\mathrm{meas}}(x,T)$ in terms of $U(x,T)$, $I_{m}$, $R_{c}(T)$, $R_{l}(T)$, and $V_{S}(T)$. Clearly state the sign convention for $I_{m}$ and the resulting sign of the resistive contribution.\n\n2. Propose a four-terminal (Kelvin) measurement scheme and use it to derive the relationship between the experimentally observed temperature slope $\\mathrm{d}V_{\\mathrm{meas}}/\\mathrm{d}T$ and the true entropic coefficient $(\\partial U/\\partial T)_{x}$. Your derivation should isolate $(\\partial U/\\partial T)_{x}$ in terms of measurable quantities and temperature derivatives of the parasitics, allowing a nonzero $\\mathrm{d}V_{S}/\\mathrm{d}T$.\n\n3. Using the derived relationship, compute the corrected entropic coefficient $(\\partial U/\\partial T)_{x}$ at $x \\approx 0.5$ from the following data obtained under two-terminal microcurrent control:\n- Measured slope $\\mathrm{d}V_{\\mathrm{meas}}/\\mathrm{d}T = -0.35 \\ \\mathrm{mV/K}$,\n- Microcurrent magnitude $I_{m} = 100 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{A}$ (take positive $I_{m}$ as discharge, reducing the terminal voltage through resistive drops),\n- Contact resistance modeled as $R_{c}(T) = R_{c0}\\left[1+\\alpha_{c}\\left(T-298 \\ \\mathrm{K}\\right)\\right]$ with $R_{c0} = 20 \\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega$ and temperature coefficient $\\alpha_{c} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$,\n- Per-lead resistance modeled as $R_{l}(T) = R_{l0}\\left[1+\\alpha_{l}\\left(T-298 \\ \\mathrm{K}\\right)\\right]$ with $R_{l0} = 50 \\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega$ and $\\alpha_{l} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$,\n- Net thermoelectric slope $\\mathrm{d}V_{S}/\\mathrm{d}T = +2.0 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{V/K}$ due to unavoidable asymmetry.\n\nAssume the total parasitic path is one contact in series with two identical leads, neglect internal cell polarization and any non-ohmic kinetics under the microcurrent, and work to first order in temperature changes around $298 \\ \\mathrm{K}$. Express your final numerical answer for $(\\partial U/\\partial T)_{x}$ in $\\mathrm{mV/K}$, rounding to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "We begin by formalizing the physical model. The Open-Circuit Voltage (OCV) $U(x,T)$ is the equilibrium potential at a given stoichiometric fraction $x$ and temperature $T$. When a small current $I_{m}$ is imposed, the instrument measures a voltage at its binding posts that differs from $U(x,T)$ due to series ohmic drops along the connection and thermoelectric offsets. By Ohm’s law, the series drop across a resistance $R(T)$ carrying current $I_{m}$ is $I_{m} R(T)$. By the Seebeck effect, a thermoelectric path with Seebeck coefficient $S$ contributes an offset $V_{S}(T)=\\int S\\,\\mathrm{d}T$, so that locally $\\mathrm{d}V_{S}/\\mathrm{d}T=S_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ for the effective thermocouple.\n\nWe adopt the sign convention that $I_{m}0$ corresponds to discharge (current leaving the positive terminal), which reduces the terminal voltage across any series resistance. Let $R_{\\mathrm{path}}(T)$ be the total parasitic path resistance, modeled as\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{path}}(T)=R_{c}(T)+2\\,R_{l}(T),\n$$\nwith one contact resistance and two identical lead resistances in series. To first order in $I_{m}$, the apparent two-terminal measured voltage is\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{meas}}(x,T)=U(x,T)-I_{m}R_{\\mathrm{path}}(T)+V_{S}(T).\n$$\nThe minus sign in the resistive term arises because under discharge the ohmic drop lowers the measured terminal voltage.\n\nA four-terminal (Kelvin) measurement scheme uses two separate sense leads that connect directly to the cell terminals and draw negligible current, while the current is carried by separate force leads. In the Kelvin arrangement, the sense leads measure the potential at the cell terminals free from the ohmic drops along the force leads and their force-contact resistances, because the sense lead current is approximately zero and thus produces negligible $I R$ drop along the sense path. Residual thermoelectric offsets $V_{S}(T)$ can remain if the sense wiring metals and junctions produce a net Seebeck path; these are minimized by using identical metals and symmetric routing but are included here as a nonzero $\\mathrm{d}V_{S}/\\mathrm{d}T$.\n\nDifferentiating the two-terminal expression with respect to temperature at fixed stoichiometry $x$ gives\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{\\mathrm{meas}}}{\\mathrm{d}T}=\\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial T}\\right)_{x}-I_{m}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}R_{\\mathrm{path}}}{\\mathrm{d}T}+\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{S}}{\\mathrm{d}T}.\n$$\nSolving for the true entropic coefficient yields\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial T}\\right)_{x}=\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{\\mathrm{meas}}}{\\mathrm{d}T}+I_{m}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}R_{\\mathrm{path}}}{\\mathrm{d}T}-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{S}}{\\mathrm{d}T}.\n$$\nUnder the Kelvin arrangement, $R_{\\mathrm{path}}(T)$ refers to the force path only; since the sense path carries negligible current, the ohmic term does not appear in the sensed voltage, but when two-terminal data are used, the above correction applies.\n\nWe now evaluate the correction using the provided linear Temperature Coefficient of Resistance (TCR) models:\n$$\nR_{c}(T)=R_{c0}\\left[1+\\alpha_{c}\\left(T-298\\ \\mathrm{K}\\right)\\right],\\quad R_{l}(T)=R_{l0}\\left[1+\\alpha_{l}\\left(T-298\\ \\mathrm{K}\\right)\\right].\n$$\nDifferentiating gives\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}R_{c}}{\\mathrm{d}T}=R_{c0}\\alpha_{c},\\quad \\frac{\\mathrm{d}R_{l}}{\\mathrm{d}T}=R_{l0}\\alpha_{l},\n$$\nand therefore\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}R_{\\mathrm{path}}}{\\mathrm{d}T}=R_{c0}\\alpha_{c}+2\\,R_{l0}\\alpha_{l}.\n$$\nConvert the given quantities to base units (Ohms, Amperes, Volts):\n- $R_{c0}=20\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega=2.0\\times 10^{-2}\\ \\Omega$,\n- $R_{l0}=50\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega=5.0\\times 10^{-2}\\ \\Omega$,\n- $\\alpha_{c}=3.0\\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$,\n- $\\alpha_{l}=2.0\\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$,\n- $I_{m}=100\\ \\mu\\mathrm{A}=1.0\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{A}$,\n- $\\mathrm{d}V_{S}/\\mathrm{d}T=+2.0\\ \\mu\\mathrm{V/K}=2.0\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{V/K}$,\n- $\\mathrm{d}V_{\\mathrm{meas}}/\\mathrm{d}T=-0.35\\ \\mathrm{mV/K}=-3.5\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{V/K}$.\n\nCompute the resistance derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}R_{\\mathrm{path}}}{\\mathrm{d}T}=\\left(2.0\\times 10^{-2}\\right)\\left(3.0\\times 10^{-3}\\right)+2\\left(5.0\\times 10^{-2}\\right)\\left(2.0\\times 10^{-3}\\right).\n$$\nNumerically,\n$$\n\\left(2.0\\times 10^{-2}\\right)\\left(3.0\\times 10^{-3}\\right)=6.0\\times 10^{-5}\\ \\Omega/\\mathrm{K},\n$$\n$$\n2\\left(5.0\\times 10^{-2}\\right)\\left(2.0\\times 10^{-3}\\right)=2.0\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\Omega/\\mathrm{K},\n$$\nso\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}R_{\\mathrm{path}}}{\\mathrm{d}T}=2.6\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\Omega/\\mathrm{K}.\n$$\nThen\n$$\nI_{m}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}R_{\\mathrm{path}}}{\\mathrm{d}T}=\\left(1.0\\times 10^{-4}\\right)\\left(2.6\\times 10^{-4}\\right)=2.6\\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{V/K}.\n$$\nSubstitute into the entropic coefficient expression:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial T}\\right)_{x}=-3.5\\times 10^{-4}+2.6\\times 10^{-8}-2.0\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\ \\mathrm{V/K}.\n$$\nCombine the terms:\n$$\n-3.5\\times 10^{-4}-2.0\\times 10^{-6}=-3.52\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{V/K},\n$$\n$$\n-3.52\\times 10^{-4}+2.6\\times 10^{-8}=-3.51974\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{V/K}.\n$$\nConvert to $\\mathrm{mV/K}$ by multiplying by $10^{3}$:\n$$\n-3.51974\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{V/K}=-0.351974\\ \\mathrm{mV/K}.\n$$\nRound to three significant figures:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial T}\\right)_{x}\\approx -0.352\\ \\mathrm{mV/K}.\n$$\nThis value represents the corrected entropic coefficient at $x\\approx 0.5$, accounting for the parasitic ohmic temperature dependence and the thermoelectric slope under the stated two-terminal microcurrent measurement, and is the target quantity that a properly implemented four-terminal Kelvin sense would directly approach when $\\mathrm{d}V_{S}/\\mathrm{d}T$ is minimized.",
