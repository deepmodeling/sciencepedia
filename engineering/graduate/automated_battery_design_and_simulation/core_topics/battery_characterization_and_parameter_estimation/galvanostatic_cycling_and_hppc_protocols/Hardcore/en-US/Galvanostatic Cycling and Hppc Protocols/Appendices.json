            "problem": "An automated battery cycler implements a Constant-Current–Constant-Voltage (CC–CV) charge protocol for a single lithium-ion cell under test within a Hybrid Pulse Power Characterization (HPPC) workflow. The controller enforces a galvanostatic step at a prescribed constant current $I_{\\mathrm{CC}}$ until the cell reaches a specified terminal voltage limit $V_{\\max}$, after which it enforces a constant-voltage step at $V(t)=V_{\\max}$ and allows the current to decay. The transition and termination logic are executed by threshold tests on the measured terminal voltage and current.\n\nStarting from fundamental definitions of galvanostatic control (fixed current) and constant-voltage control (fixed terminal voltage), and the standard observation that the terminal voltage of a rechargeable cell increases monotonically during a CC charge at fixed $I_{\\mathrm{CC}}$ due to rising state of charge and ohmic/polarization contributions, do the following:\n\n1. Derive a mathematically precise condition, expressed as a first-passage condition on the measured terminal voltage $V(t)$ under the CC step at $I(t)=I_{\\mathrm{CC}}$, that triggers the controller’s switch from the CC step to the CV step. State the condition in terms of $V_{\\max}$ and $V(t)$ without assuming any particular internal model beyond monotonicity of $V(t)$ during the CC step.\n\n2. After the switch, define $t=0$ at the instant the CV step begins with $V(t)=V_{\\max}$. In many batteries and equivalent-circuit models, the current under a constant-voltage hold decays approximately as a first-order response.

The mathematical model and parameter constraints ($I_00, \\tau0, I_\\infty \\ge 0, I_{\\mathrm{end}}  I_\\infty$) are physically meaningful.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and complete. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\n**Part 1: CC-to-CV Transition Condition**\nThe galvanostatic (Constant-Current or CC) charging step is characterized by a constant applied current, $I(t) = I_{\\mathrm{CC}}$. During this phase, the problem states that the cell's terminal voltage, $V(t)$, is a monotonically increasing function of time $t$.\n\nThe controller's task is to switch from the CC step to the Constant-Voltage (CV) step as soon as the terminal voltage reaches the predefined maximum value, $V_{\\max}$. This is a \"first-passage\" problem, where we identify the first instant in time that the system's state (the voltage $V(t)$) crosses a certain boundary.\n\nLet the CC step begin at time $t_{0}$, with an initial voltage $V(t_{0})  V_{\\max}$. Since $V(t)$ is continuous and monotonically increasing for $t \\ge t_{0}$, it is guaranteed to reach the value $V_{\\max}$ at some future time. The controller, which monitors $V(t)$, must trigger the mode switch when this event occurs.\n\nIn a continuous-time idealization, the switch occurs at the precise instant $t_{\\mathrm{switch}}$ such that $V(t_{\\mathrm{switch}}) = V_{\\max}$. However, a real-world digital controller evaluates a condition at discrete time steps. The condition for remaining in the CC mode is $V(t)  V_{\\max}$. The transition is triggered at the first moment this condition is violated.\n\nTherefore, the mathematically precise condition, evaluated at any time $t$ during the CC step, that triggers the controller's switch to the CV step is the voltage reaching or exceeding the threshold:\n$$\nV(t) \\ge V_{\\max}\n$$\nThis inequality represents the formal trigger condition for the state transition. Given the monotonic nature of $V(t)$, the first time this condition is met defines the end of the CC phase and the beginning of the CV phase.\n\n**Part 2: CV Hold Duration ($t_{\\mathrm{CV}}$)**\nFollowing the transition, the time is reset so that the CV step begins at $t=0$. During this step, the voltage is held constant at $V(t) = V_{\\max}$. The current $I(t)$ decays according to the given first-order model:\n$$\nI(t) = I_{0}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) + I_{\\infty}\n$$\nwhere $I_0  0$, $\\tau  0$, and $I_\\infty \\ge 0$.\n\nThe CV step terminates when the current $I(t)$ first falls to or below a specified cut-off current, $I_{\\mathrm{end}}$. The duration of the CV step, denoted $t_{\\mathrm{CV}}$, is the time required for the current to decay from its initial value at $t=0$ to the value $I_{\\mathrm{end}}$. Thus, we must solve for $t_{\\mathrm{CV}}$ in the equation:\n$$\nI(t_{\\mathrm{CV}}) = I_{\\mathrm{end}}\n$$\nSubstituting the model for $I(t)$:\n$$\nI_{0}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\mathrm{CV}}}{\\tau}\\right) + I_{\\infty} = I_{\\mathrm{end}}\n$$\nTo solve for $t_{\\mathrm{CV}}$, we first isolate the exponential term.\n$$\nI_{0}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\mathrm{CV}}}{\\tau}\\right) = I_{\\mathrm{end}} - I_{\\infty}\n$$\nSince $I_0  0$, we can divide by $I_0$:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\mathrm{CV}}}{\\tau}\\right) = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{end}} - I_{\\infty}}{I_{0}}\n$$\nNext, we take the natural logarithm of both sides to solve for the exponent.\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\mathrm{CV}}}{\\tau}\\right)\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{end}} - I_{\\infty}}{I_{0}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{t_{\\mathrm{CV}}}{\\tau} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{end}} - I_{\\infty}}{I_{0}}\\right)\n$$\nThe argument of the logarithm must be positive for the result to be a real number. From the problem statement, $I_{\\mathrm{end}}  I_{\\infty}$, so the numerator $I_{\\mathrm{end}} - I_{\\infty}$ is positive. Also, $I_{0}  0$. Therefore, the argument is positive, and the logarithm is well-defined.\n\nFinally, we solve for $t_{\\mathrm{CV}}$ by multiplying by $-\\tau$:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{CV}} = -\\tau \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{end}} - I_{\\infty}}{I_{0}}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms, $-\\ln(x) = \\ln(1/x)$, we can write the expression in a more intuitive form:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{CV}} = \\tau \\ln\\left(\\left(\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{end}} - I_{\\infty}}{I_{0}}\\right)^{-1}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{CV}} = \\tau \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_{0}}{I_{\\mathrm{end}} - I_{\\infty}}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the CV hold duration. For this duration to be positive ($t_{\\mathrm{CV}}  0$), the argument of the logarithm must be greater than $1$, which implies $I_0  I_{\\mathrm{end}} - I_\\infty$, or $I_0 + I_\\infty  I_{\\mathrm{end}}$. Since $I(0) = I_0 + I_\\infty$, this condition corresponds to the physically necessary requirement that the initial current at the start of the CV phase must be greater than the termination current.",

The resistance is:\n$$\nR(T) = R_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\,[1 + \\alpha\\,(T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}})] = R_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\,[1 + \\alpha\\,\\delta T]\n$$\nThe true current step includes a fractional overshoot $\\beta$ on top of the setpoint $\\Delta I_{\\mathrm{sp}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta I_{\\mathrm{true}} = (1+\\beta)\\,\\Delta I_{\\mathrm{sp}}\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions back into the equation for $\\hat{R}$:\n$$\n\\hat{R} = \\frac{R(T) \\Delta I_{\\mathrm{true}} + n_V}{\\Delta I_{\\mathrm{sp}}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{ref}}(1 + \\alpha\\,\\delta T) (1+\\beta)\\,\\Delta I_{\\mathrm{sp}} + n_V}{\\Delta I_{\\mathrm{sp}}}\n$$\nSimplifying this expression yields $\\hat{R}$ as a function of the random variables $n_V$, $\\beta$, and $\\delta T$:\n$$\n\\hat{R}(n_V, \\beta, \\delta T) = R_{\\mathrm{ref}}(1 + \\alpha\\,\\delta T)(1+\\beta) + \\frac{n_V}{\\Delta I_{\\mathrm{sp}}}\n$$\nExpanding the product:\n$$\n\\hat{R} = R_{\\mathrm{ref}}(1 + \\beta + \\alpha\\,\\delta T + \\alpha\\,\\beta\\,\\delta T) + \\frac{n_V}{\\Delta I_{\\mathrm{sp}}}\n$$\nThe problem requires a first-order (linearized) approximation, neglecting products of small deviations. The term $\\alpha\\,\\beta\\,\\delta T$ is a product of two small quantities, $\\beta$ and $\\delta T$, and is thus neglected. The linearized expression for the estimator is:\n$$\n\\hat{R}_{\\mathrm{lin}} = R_{\\mathrm{ref}}(1 + \\beta + \\alpha\\,\\delta T) + \\frac{n_V}{\\Delta I_{\\mathrm{sp}}} = R_{\\mathrm{ref}} + R_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\beta + R_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\alpha\\,\\delta T + \\frac{n_V}{\\Delta I_{\\mathrm{sp}}}\n$$\nThis is the linearized model of the estimator, showing its dependence on the zero-mean random variables $n_V$, $\\beta$, and $\\delta T$. The nominal value of the estimator, when all deviations are zero, is $R_{\\mathrm{ref}}$.\n\n### Step 2: Combined Standard Uncertainty of $\\hat{R}$\n\nThe combined standard uncertainty, $u_{\\hat{R}}$, is the standard deviation of the estimator $\\hat{R}$. For a function $Y = f(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_N)$ of independent random variables $X_i$, the variance $\\sigma_Y^2$ can be approximated to first order by the law of propagation of uncertainty:\n$$\n\\sigma_Y^2 = u_Y^2 \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial X_i} \\right)^2 \\sigma_{X_i}^2\n$$\nIn our case, the function is $\\hat{R}_{\\mathrm{lin}}$ and the independent random variables are $n_V$, $\\beta$, and $\\delta T$, with standard deviations $\\sigma_V$, $\\sigma_{\\beta}$, and $\\sigma_T$, respectively. We compute the partial derivatives (sensitivity coefficients) of $\\hat{R}$ with respect to each variable, evaluated at the nominal point ($n_V=0$, $\\beta=0$, $\\delta T=0$):\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\hat{R}}{\\partial n_V} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta I_{\\mathrm{sp}}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\hat{R}}{\\partial \\beta} = R_{\\mathrm{ref}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\hat{R}}{\\partial (\\delta T)} = R_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\alpha\n$$\nThe variance of the estimator, $u_{\\hat{R}}^2$, is the sum of the squared sensitivity coefficients multiplied by the variances of the respective input variables:\n$$\nu_{\\hat{R}}^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\hat{R}}{\\partial n_V}\\right)^2 \\sigma_V^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\hat{R}}{\\partial \\beta}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{\\beta}^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\hat-R}{\\partial (\\delta T)}\\right)^2 \\sigma_T^2\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the partial derivatives:\n$$\nu_{\\hat{R}}^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\Delta I_{\\mathrm{sp}}}\\right)^2 \\sigma_V^2 + (R_{\\mathrm{ref}})^2 \\sigma_{\\beta}^2 + (R_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\alpha)^2 \\sigma_T^2\n$$\nThe combined standard uncertainty $u_{\\hat{R}}$ is the square root of this variance:\n$$\nu_{\\hat{R}} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{\\sigma_V^2}{(\\Delta I_{\\mathrm{sp}})^2} + R_{\\mathrm{ref}}^2 \\sigma_{\\beta}^2 + R_{\\mathrm{ref}}^2 \\alpha^2 \\sigma_T^2 }\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Numerical Evaluation of $u_{\\hat{R}}$\n\nThe problem provides the following numerical values:\n- $R_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 7.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega}$\n- $\\alpha = 3.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n- $\\sigma_T = 0.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- $\\sigma_{\\beta} = 0.015$\n- $\\sigma_V = 4.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n- $\\Delta I_{\\mathrm{sp}} = 40\\,\\mathrm{A}$\n\nWe calculate the contribution of each term to the total variance $u_{\\hat{R}}^2$:\n1.
