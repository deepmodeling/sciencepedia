            "problem": "In automated battery design and simulation for Lithium-ion battery (Li-ion) systems, the electrochemical reaction rate at an electrode is commonly modeled by the Butler–Volmer equation, which captures the dependence of the current density $i$ on the overpotential $\\eta$, temperature $T$, and the charge-transfer coefficient $\\alpha$. Consider a single-step charge-transfer reaction whose kinetics in the Tafel regime are described by the Butler–Volmer relation for large-magnitude overpotentials, and define the Tafel slope magnitude $b(T)$ by the relation between the overpotential and the base-$10$ logarithm of the current density, $b(T) \\equiv \\mathrm{d}\\eta / \\mathrm{d}\\log_{10} i$, evaluated in the appropriate Tafel limit. Assume that the charge-transfer coefficient $\\alpha$ is temperature-independent over the temperature range of interest and that the exchange current density $i_{0}$ may be treated as a prefactor that does not enter the slope expression after differentiation.\n\nStarting from first principles and widely accepted laws, namely:\n- the Butler–Volmer equation for a single-step electron transfer,\n- the definition of the Tafel region as the limit where one exponential term dominates,\n- and the change-of-base formula between $\\ln$ and $\\log_{10}$,\n\nderive the functional dependence of $b(T)$ on temperature $T$ and the charge-transfer coefficient $\\alpha$ in the cathodic Tafel regime.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the temperature dependence of the cathodic Tafel slope magnitude from the Butler-Volmer equation and a subsequent calculation of its change over a specified temperature interval.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Tafel Slope Magnitude**\n\nThe Butler–Volmer equation for a single-step, one-electron transfer ($n=1$) reaction is given by:\n$$i = i_{0} \\left[ \\exp\\left(\\frac{(1-\\alpha) F \\eta}{R T}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha F \\eta}{R T}\\right) \\right]$$\nwhere $i$ is the net current density, $i_{0}$ is the exchange current density, $\\alpha$ is the charge-transfer coefficient, $\\eta$ is the overpotential, $F$ is the Faraday constant, $R$ is the molar gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe problem specifies the cathodic Tafel regime, which corresponds to large negative overpotentials ($\\eta \\ll 0$). In this limit, the term $\\exp\\left(\\frac{(1-\\alpha) F \\eta}{R T}\\right)$ approaches zero much faster than the term $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha F \\eta}{R T}\\right)$ grows. Therefore, the first exponential term becomes negligible compared to the second. The Butler–Volmer equation simplifies to:\n$$i \\approx -i_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha F \\eta}{R T}\\right)$$\nHere, the net current density $i$ is negative, indicating a cathodic current. Let us define the magnitude of the cathodic current density as $i_c = -i$, which is a positive quantity. The equation becomes:\n$$i_c = i_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha F \\eta}{R T}\\right)$$\nTo find the overpotential $\\eta$ as a function of $i_c$, we rearrange the equation. First, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{i_c}{i_0}\\right) = -\\frac{\\alpha F \\eta}{R T}$$\nSolving for $\\eta$:\n$$\\eta = -\\frac{R T}{\\alpha F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{i_c}{i_0}\\right) = -\\frac{R T}{\\alpha F} (\\ln(i_c) - \\ln(i_0))$$\n\nThe problem defines the Tafel slope magnitude using the base-$10$ logarithm, $\\log_{10}$. We use the change-of-base formula, $\\ln(x) = \\ln(10) \\log_{10}(x)$, to convert the expression for $\\eta$:\n$$\\eta = -\\frac{R T \\ln(10)}{\\alpha F} (\\log_{10}(i_c) - \\log_{10}(i_0))$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$\\eta = -\\frac{R T \\ln(10)}{\\alpha F} \\log_{10}(i_c) + \\frac{R T \\ln(10)}{\\alpha F} \\log_{10}(i_0)$$\nThe problem defines the Tafel slope as $b(T) \\equiv \\mathrm{d}\\eta / \\mathrm{d}\\log_{10} i$. For the cathodic branch, we differentiate $\\eta$ with respect to $\\log_{10}(i_c)$. The exchange current density $i_0$ is treated as a constant with respect to $i_c$ during differentiation, as per the problem statement.\n$$b_c(T) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\eta}{\\mathrm{d}\\log_{10}(i_c)} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\log_{10}(i_c)} \\left( -\\frac{R T \\ln(10)}{\\alpha F} \\log_{10}(i_c) + \\text{constant} \\right)$$\n$$b_c(T) = -\\frac{R T \\ln(10)}{\\alpha F}$$\nThis is the cathodic Tafel slope. The problem asks for the Tafel slope magnitude, which we will denote as $B(T)$. Since $R$, $T$, $\\alpha$, $F$, and $\\ln(10)$ are all positive quantities, the slope $b_c(T)$ is negative. The magnitude is:\n$$B(T) = |b_c(T)| = \\frac{R T \\ln(10)}{\\alpha F}$$\nThis expression shows that the Tafel slope magnitude is directly proportional to the absolute temperature $T$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Change in Tafel Slope Magnitude**\n\nWe are asked to compute the change in the Tafel slope magnitude, $\\Delta B$, when the temperature increases from $T_1 = 298\\ \\mathrm{K}$ to $T_2 = 333\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n$$\\Delta B = B(T_2) - B(T_1)$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $B(T)$:\n$$\\Delta B = \\frac{R T_2 \\ln(10)}{\\alpha F} - \\frac{R T_1 \\ln(10)}{\\alpha F}$$\nFactoring out the common terms:\n$$\\Delta B = \\frac{R \\ln(10)}{\\alpha F} (T_2 - T_1)$$\nNow, we substitute the given values:\n- $R = 8.314462618\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n- $F = 96485.33212\\ \\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}}$\n- $\\alpha = 0.42$\n- $T_1 = 298\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n- $T_2 = 333\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n\nThe temperature difference is $\\Delta T = T_2 - T_1 = 333\\ \\mathrm{K} - 298\\ \\mathrm{K} = 35\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\nThe value of the natural logarithm of $10$ is $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.302585$.\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $\\Delta B$:\n$$\\Delta B = \\frac{(8.314462618\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times \\ln(10) \\times (35\\ \\mathrm{K})}{(0.42) \\times (96485.33212\\ \\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}})}$$\nThe units of the calculation are $\\frac{\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}} \\cdot \\mathrm{K}}{\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{J}}{\\mathrm{C}} = \\mathrm{V}$. The result will be in Volts (per decade).\nLet's compute the numerical value:\n$$\\Delta B = \\frac{8.314462618 \\times 2.302585093 \\times 35}{0.42 \\times 96485.33212}$$\n$$\\Delta B = \\frac{670.0678278...}{40523.83949...} \\approx 0.01653528\\ \\mathrm{V\\,decade^{-1}}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in millivolts per decade (mV per decade). To convert from Volts to millivolts, we multiply by $1000$:\n$$\\Delta B \\approx 0.01653528 \\times 1000\\ \\mathrm{mV\\,decade^{-1}} \\approx 16.53528\\ \\mathrm{mV\\,decade^{-1}}$$\nFinally, we round the result to four significant figures:\n$$\\Delta B \\approx 16.54\\ \\mathrm{mV\\,decade^{-1}}$$",

Applying this to the denominator, $T \\, T_{n+1} \\approx T^2$, we get:\n$$\\frac{E_a}{R} \\left( \\frac{\\Delta t \\, f(T)}{T^2} \\right) \\le \\ln(2)$$\nSolving for $\\Delta t$:\n$$\\Delta t \\le (\\ln 2) \\, \\frac{R\\,T^2}{E_a\\,f(T)}$$\nThis is the required local, state-dependent explicit time-step restriction.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Switching Criterion**\n\nThe problem defines a characteristic \"reactive timescale\" as $\\tau_r \\equiv T/f(T)$ and proposes that an implicit method should be used when the maximum admissible explicit time step, $\\Delta t_{\\text{max}}$, becomes smaller than a fraction $\\beta$ of this timescale. The condition to switch is thus $\\Delta t_{\\text{max}}  \\beta \\, \\tau_r$. Consequently, the forward Euler method is considered practical if the opposite holds:\n$$\\Delta t_{\\text{max}} \\ge \\beta \\, \\tau_r$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\Delta t_{\\text{max}}$ from Part 1 and for $\\tau_r$:\n$$(\\ln 2)\\,\\frac{R\\,T^2}{E_a\\,f(T)} \\ge \\beta\\,\\frac{T}{f(T)}$$\nWe cancel the positive term $f(T)$ from both sides and divide by $T$:\n$$(\\ln 2)\\,\\frac{R\\,T}{E_a} \\ge \\beta$$\nTo express this as a condition on the dimensionless sensitivity $\\theta = E_a/(R\\,T)$, we rearrange the inequality:\n$$\\frac{\\ln 2}{\\beta} \\ge \\frac{E_a}{R\\,T} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\frac{E_a}{R\\,T} \\le \\frac{\\ln 2}{\\beta}$$\nThis inequality provides a threshold for stiffness: if the dimensionless sensitivity $\\theta$ is too high, the explicit step size required for accuracy becomes impractically small relative to the characteristic timescale of the problem.\n\n**Combined Decision Rule and Option Evaluation**\n\nThe complete decision rule is to use forward Euler if and only if both the chosen time step $\\Delta t$ respects the accuracy limit and the problem is not excessively stiff. The full condition is:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\le (\\ln 2)\\,\\frac{R\\,T^2}{E_a\\,f(T)} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{E_a}{R\\,T} \\le \\frac{\\ln 2}{\\beta}\n$$\n\n*   **Option A**: This option states the rule is to use forward Euler if $\\Delta t \\le (\\ln 2)\\,\\frac{R\\,T^2}{E_a\\,f(T)}$ and $\\frac{E_a}{R\\,T} \\le \\frac{\\ln 2}{\\beta}$. This exactly matches our derived result. **Correct.**\n\n*   **Option B**: This option presents $\\Delta t \\le \\frac{2}{\\big|f'(T)\\big|}$, which is a standard linear stability limit, violating the \"no pre-packaged formulas\" rule. The second condition is also inconsistent with the first. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C**: This option gives $\\Delta t \\le \\frac{R\\,T^2}{E_a\\,f(T)}$, which is missing the factor of $\\ln 2$. The second condition is also inconsistent with the first. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D**: The time-step restriction $\\Delta t \\le \\frac{\\ln 2}{\\,f'(T)/f(T)\\,}$ is dimensionally and factually incorrect as it is missing a factor of $1/f(T)$. **Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the derivation, only Option A is correct.",
