            "problem": "A lithium-ion battery design platform calibrates the temperature dependence of a parasitic Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) formation rate constant, denoted by $k(T)$ with units $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, for automated simulation of degradation and lifetime. The physical expectation is that the rate constant obeys the Arrhenius law, which relates $k(T)$, a pre-exponential factor $A$, and an activation energy $E_{a}$ through a temperature dependence in $T$ based on fundamental thermally activated kinetics. In the experimental data pipeline, a linear regression was performed on a base-$10$ logarithmic Arrhenius plot, with the dependent variable $\\log_{10} k$ and the independent variable $1/T$ (with $T$ in $\\mathrm{K}$).

The problem considers two cases: the natural logarithm ($\\ln$) and the base-$10$ logarithm ($\\log_{10}$).\n\n**1. Natural Logarithm Form**\nTaking the natural logarithm of the Arrhenius equation gives:\n$$\n\\ln(k) = \\ln\\left(A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{RT}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, $\\ln(ab) = \\ln(a) + \\ln(b)$ and $\\ln(e^x) = x$, we get:\n$$\n\\ln(k) = \\ln(A) - \\frac{E_a}{RT} = \\left(-\\frac{E_a}{R}\\right) \\frac{1}{T} + \\ln(A)\n$$\nThis equation is in the form of a line, $y = mx + c$, where the dependent variable is $y = \\ln(k)$ and the independent variable is $x = 1/T$. The slope $s_{\\ln}$ and intercept $b_{\\ln}$ are therefore:\n$$\ns_{\\ln} = -\\frac{E_a}{R}\n$$\n$$\nb_{\\ln} = \\ln(A)\n$$\n\n**2. Base-10 Logarithm Form**\nTaking the base-$10$ logarithm of the Arrhenius equation gives:\n$$\n\\log_{10}(k) = \\log_{10}\\left(A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{RT}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, $\\log_{10}(ab) = \\log_{10}(a) + \\log_{10}(b)$ and $\\log_{10}(x^y) = y\\log_{10}(x)$:\n$$\n\\log_{10}(k) = \\log_{10}(A) - \\frac{E_a}{RT} \\log_{10}(e)\n$$\nTo relate this to the natural logarithm, we use the change of base formula: $\\log_b(a) = \\frac{\\ln(a)}{\\ln(b)}$. Applying this to $\\log_{10}(e)$:\n$$\n\\log_{10}(e) = \\frac{\\ln(e)}{\\ln(10)} = \\frac{1}{\\ln(10)}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the equation for $\\log_{10}(k)$:\n$$\n\\log_{10}(k) = \\left(-\\frac{E_a}{R\\ln(10)}\\right) \\frac{1}{T} + \\log_{10}(A)\n$$\nThis is also in the form of a line, $y = mx + c$, where the dependent variable is $y = \\log_{10}(k)$ and the independent variable is $x = 1/T$. The slope $s_{10}$ and intercept $b_{10}$ are:\n$$\ns_{10} = -\\frac{E_a}{R\\ln(10)}\n$$\n$$\nb_{10} = \\log_{10}(A)\n$$\n\n**3. Conversion Between Parameters**\nWe can now derive the relationships between $(s_{\\ln}, b_{\\ln})$ and $(s_{10}, b_{10})$.\n\nFor the slopes:\n$$\ns_{\\ln} = -\\frac{E_a}{R} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad s_{10} = \\frac{s_{\\ln}}{\\ln(10)}\n$$\nThus, the conversion for the slope is:\n$$\ns_{\\ln} = s_{10} \\ln(10)\n$$\n\nFor the intercepts:\n$$\nb_{\\ln} = \\ln(A) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b_{10} = \\log_{10}(A)\n$$\nUsing the change of base formula $\\ln(A) = \\ln(10) \\cdot \\log_{10}(A)$:\n$$\nb_{\\ln} = b_{10} \\ln(10)\n$$\n\n**4. Expression for Activation Energy ($E_a$)**\nAs requested, we express $E_a$ in terms of $s_{10}$, $R$, and $\\ln(10)$. Starting from the expression for $s_{10}$:\n$$\ns_{10} = -\\frac{E_a}{R\\ln(10)}\n$$\nRearranging to solve for $E_a$:\n$$\nE_a = -s_{10} R \\ln(10)\n$$\n\n**5. Numerical Evaluation**\nWe are given:\n$s_{10} = -2.150 \\times 10^{3} \\ \\mathrm{K}$\n$b_{10} = -3.200$\n$R = 8.314462618 \\ \\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, calculate $s_{\\ln}$:\n$$\ns_{\\ln} = s_{10} \\ln(10) = (-2.150 \\times 10^{3} \\ \\mathrm{K}) \\times \\ln(10) \\approx -4950.55795... \\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$\ns_{\\ln} = -4.951 \\times 10^{3} \\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$\n\nNext, calculate $b_{\\ln}$:\n$$\nb_{\\ln} = b_{10} \\ln(10) = (-3.200) \\times \\ln(10) \\approx -7.3682722...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$\nb_{\\ln} = -7.368\n$$\n\nFinally, calculate $E_a$:\n$$\nE_a = -s_{10} R \\ln(10) = -(-2.150 \\times 10^{3} \\ \\mathrm{K}) \\times (8.314462618 \\ \\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}) \\times \\ln(10)\n$$\n$$\nE_a \\approx (2.150 \\times 10^{3}) \\times (8.314462618) \\times (2.302585093) \\ \\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nE_a \\approx 41162.535... \\ \\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in $\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the activation energy for ionic conductivity, $E_{a,\\sigma}$, from experimental temperature-dependent resistance data. This is a standard analysis procedure in materials science and electrochemistry, relying on the Arrhenius relationship for thermally activated processes. The solution is developed by first principles as follows.\n\nThe core relationship governing the temperature dependence of conductivity, $\\sigma$, is the Arrhenius equation:\n$$ \\sigma(T) = \\sigma_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{a,\\sigma}}{R_g T}\\right) $$\nHere, $\\sigma_0$ is the pre-exponential factor, $E_{a,\\sigma}$ is the activation energy in $\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, $R_g$ is the universal gas constant with the value $8.314462618\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, and $T$ is the absolute temperature in Kelvin. Our objective is to determine $E_{a,\\sigma}$ from the provided experimental data.\n\nThe experimental data for each test case consist of measured high-frequency intercepts, $R_{\\mathrm{meas}}$, at various temperatures, $T$. The problem states that $R_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ is the sum of the bulk electrolyte resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{elec}}$, and any constant series resistance offset, $R_{\\mathrm{series}}$. Thus, for each measurement, we first isolate the electrolyte's contribution:\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{elec}} = R_{\\mathrm{meas}} - R_{\\mathrm{series}} $$\n\nNext, we relate the electrolyte resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{elec}}$, to its intrinsic conductivity, $\\sigma$. Based on the fundamental definition of electrical resistance for a homogeneous material with uniform cross-sectional area $A$ and length $L$, we have:\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{elec}} = \\rho \\frac{L}{A} $$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the resistivity. Since conductivity is the reciprocal of resistivity, $\\sigma = 1/\\rho$, we can substitute this into the equation:\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{elec}} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma} \\frac{L}{A} $$\nRearranging this equation allows us to calculate the conductivity at each temperature from the corresponding electrolyte resistance:\n$$ \\sigma = \\frac{L}{A \\cdot R_{\\mathrm{elec}}} $$\nAll quantities must be in consistent SI units. The problem specifies $L$ in $\\mathrm{m}$, $A$ in $\\mathrm{m}^2$, and $R_{\\mathrm{elec}}$ in $\\Omega$, which correctly yields $\\sigma$ in $\\mathrm{S}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$. This calculation is performed for every data point $(T_i, R_{\\mathrm{meas}, i})$ to generate a set of conductivity-temperature pairs $(\\sigma_i, T_i)$.\n\nTo extract the activation energy $E_{a,\\sigma}$ from the Arrhenius equation, we must linearize it. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of the Arrhenius equation yields:\n$$ \\ln(\\sigma) = \\ln\\left(\\sigma_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{a,\\sigma}}{R_g T}\\right)\\right) $$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\ln(\\sigma) = \\ln(\\sigma_0) - \\frac{E_{a,\\sigma}}{R_g T} $$\nThis equation is in the form of a straight line, $y = c + mx$, where:\n- The dependent variable is $y = \\ln(\\sigma)$.\n- The independent variable is $x = 1/T$.\n- The y-intercept is $c = \\ln(\\sigma_0)$.\n- The slope is $m = - \\frac{E_{a,\\sigma}}{R_g}$.\n\nBy performing an ordinary least-squares linear regression on the transformed data points $(x_i, y_i) = (1/T_i, \\ln(\\sigma_i))$, we can determine the slope $m$ of the best-fit line. Once the slope $m$ is known, the activation energy $E_{a,\\sigma}$ can be calculated by rearranging the slope equation:\n$$ E_{a,\\sigma} = -m \\cdot R_g $$\n\nThis procedure is applied to each of the four test cases. The calculated activation energy for each case is then rounded to the nearest integer to provide the final result in $\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.

            "introduction": "The ultimate goal of characterizing material properties is to inform engineering design. This capstone exercise demonstrates how Arrhenius relationships for different physical phenomena are integrated into a systems-level optimization problem for battery electrode design. You will develop a program that determines the optimal electrode thickness by balancing two competing, temperature-dependent limitations: solid-state diffusion and charge-transfer kinetics. This practice bridges the gap between fundamental materials science and applied electrochemical engineering, showing how temperature-dependent parameters directly drive critical design trade-offs to meet performance targets .",

            "problem": "You are tasked with designing and implementing a complete, runnable program that computes the optimal positive-electrode thickness in meters for a lithium-ion battery electrode at a given ambient temperature by accounting for temperature-dependent solid-state diffusion in the active material and temperature-dependent charge-transfer kinetics at the particle surface. The design must be based on first principles and well-tested formulas, and it must treat the solid diffusion coefficient $D_s(T)$ and the exchange current density $i_0(T)$ as limiting mechanisms across operating regimes. The electrode is modeled as a porous composite of spherical active-material particles embedded in a matrix, with the required areal current density specified. The goal is to determine the minimal electrode thickness that satisfies both diffusion and kinetics constraints for a specified ambient temperature. The optimal thickness is defined as the smallest thickness that can sustain the specified areal current density without exceeding a prescribed reaction overpotential at the particle surface and without exceeding the diffusion-limited flux inside the particle; this choice minimizes material usage while still meeting the imposed operating current.\n\nFundamental base:\n- Fick’s first law for quasi-steady diffusion in spherical geometry: the surface molar flux $J$ in the particle scales as $J \\approx D_s(T)\\,\\Delta c_s / R_p$, where $D_s(T)$ is the solid diffusion coefficient, $\\Delta c_s$ is the concentration swing, and $R_p$ is the particle radius. This scaling follows from the diffusion equation and the boundary-layer approximation near the particle surface in steady or quasi-steady operation.\n- Butler–Volmer equation (full name: Butler–Volmer) for charge-transfer kinetics, for symmetric charge-transfer coefficient $\\alpha = 0.5$, relates the current density at the particle surface to the overpotential $\\eta$ via $i_{\\mathrm{surf}} = 2\\,i_0(T)\\,\\sinh\\!\\left(\\frac{F\\,\\eta}{2\\,R\\,T}\\right)$, where $i_0(T)$ is the exchange current density, $F$ is the Faraday constant, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n- Arrhenius temperature dependence for reaction-activated processes: $k(T) = k_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\dfrac{E_a}{R}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{T} - \\dfrac{1}{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)\\right)$, where $k(T)$ is the temperature-dependent kinetic coefficient, $k_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ is its value at the reference temperature $T_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, and $E_a$ is the activation energy. Apply this to both $D_s(T)$ and $i_0(T)$ with their respective activation energies.\n\nDefinitions and constants:\n- Areal current density requirement $i_{\\mathrm{req}}$ in $\\mathrm{A/m^2}$ must be delivered by the electrode.\n- The specific surface area of active material per unit electrode volume for spherical particles is $a_s = \\dfrac{3\\,\\epsilon_s}{R_p}$, where $\\epsilon_s$ is the volume fraction of active material and $R_p$ is the particle radius.\n- The total active-material surface area per unit electrode area is $a_s\\,L$, where $L$ is the electrode thickness.\n- The maximum diffusion-limited molar flux per unit particle surface area is $J_{\\mathrm{lim}}(T) \\approx \\dfrac{D_s(T)\\,c_{s,\\max}\\,\\Delta x}{R_p}$, where $c_{s,\\max}$ is the maximum solid-phase lithium concentration and $\\Delta x$ is the dimensionless stoichiometric swing.\n- The corresponding diffusion-limited current density per particle surface is $i_{\\mathrm{diff,surf}}(T) = n\\,F\\,J_{\\mathrm{lim}}(T)$, where $n$ is the number of electrons per lithium-ion ($n=1$).\n- The maximum reaction-limited current density per particle surface at a prescribed overpotential bound $\\eta_{\\max}$ is $i_{\\mathrm{rxn,surf}}(T,\\eta_{\\max}) = 2\\,i_0(T)\\,\\sinh\\!\\left(\\dfrac{F\\,\\eta_{\\max}}{2\\,R\\,T}\\right)$ for symmetric charge transfer.\n\nOptimization objective and constraints:\n- The areal current density delivered by the electrode is $i_{\\mathrm{deliverable}} = (a_s\\,L)\\,\\min\\!\\left(i_{\\mathrm{diff,surf}}(T),\\,i_{\\mathrm{rxn,surf}}(T,\\eta_{\\max})\\right)$ under limiting mechanisms. To meet $i_{\\mathrm{req}}$, the minimal thickness must satisfy\n$$\nL \\ge \\max\\!\\Bigg(\\dfrac{i_{\\mathrm{req}}}{a_s\\,i_{\\mathrm{rxn,surf}}(T,\\eta_{\\max})},\\;\\dfrac{i_{\\mathrm{req}}}{a_s\\,i_{\\mathrm{diff,surf}}(T)}\\Bigg).\n$$\n- The optimal thickness $L_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ is the minimum $L$ that satisfies the above inequality.

For example: $[[0.0000157,0,True],[...],...]$.\n- All computed thicknesses must be expressed in $\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nImplement the program according to the fundamental base, definitions, and test suite above.

            "solution": "The problem requires finding the optimal electrode thickness, $L_{\\mathrm{opt}}$, that satisfies a given areal current density requirement, $i_{\\mathrm{req}}$, while respecting constraints from both solid-state diffusion and charge-transfer kinetics at a specific operating temperature, $T$. The optimal thickness is the minimum thickness that meets the performance target.\n\nThe overall areal current density delivered by the electrode, $i_{\\mathrm{deliverable}}$, is the product of the total active surface area per unit electrode area ($a_s L$) and the limiting current density at the particle surface, $i_{\\mathrm{surf}}$. The particle surface current is limited by the slower of two processes: diffusion of lithium ions within the particle, and the charge-transfer reaction at the surface. Thus, $i_{\\mathrm{surf}} = \\min(i_{\\mathrm{diff,surf}}, i_{\\mathrm{rxn,surf}})$.\n$$ i_{\\mathrm{deliverable}} = (a_s L) \\cdot \\min(i_{\\mathrm{diff,surf}}(T), i_{\\mathrm{rxn,surf}}(T, \\eta_{\\max})) $$\nTo meet the requirement $i_{\\mathrm{deliverable}} \\ge i_{\\mathrm{req}}$, the thickness $L$ must satisfy:\n$$ L \\ge \\frac{i_{\\mathrm{req}}}{a_s \\cdot \\min(i_{\\mathrm{diff,surf}}(T), i_{\\mathrm{rxn,surf}}(T, \\eta_{\\max}))} $$\nThis inequality is equivalent to requiring $L$ to be greater than or equal to the thickness needed for each limit individually. This leads to the core optimization formula:\n$$ L_{\\mathrm{opt}} = \\max\\left( \\frac{i_{\\mathrm{req}}}{a_s \\cdot i_{\\mathrm{diff,surf}}(T)}, \\frac{i_{\\mathrm{req}}}{a_s \\cdot i_{\\mathrm{rxn,surf}}(T, \\eta_{\\max})} \\right) $$\nThe two limiting surface current densities, $i_{\\mathrm{diff,surf}}$ and $i_{\\mathrm{rxn,surf}}$, are temperature-dependent and must be calculated first.\n\n1.  **Temperature-Dependent Parameters:** Both the solid diffusion coefficient, $D_s(T)$, and the exchange current density, $i_0(T)$, follow the Arrhenius law. For a given temperature $T$, they are calculated as:\n    $$ D_s(T) = D_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_D}{R}\\left(\\frac{1}{T} - \\frac{1}{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)\\right) $$\n    $$ i_0(T) = i_{0,\\mathrm{ref}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{R}\\left(\\frac{1}{T} - \\frac{1}{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)\\right) $$\n\n2.  **Limiting Current Densities:**\n    - The diffusion-limited surface current, $i_{\\mathrm{diff,surf}}$, is derived from Fick's law. The maximum molar flux is $J_{\\mathrm{lim}} = D_s(T) c_{s,\\max} \\Delta x / R_p$. Converting flux to current density (with $n=1$ electron per ion) gives:\n      $$ i_{\\mathrm{diff,surf}}(T) = F \\cdot \\frac{D_s(T) c_{s,\\max} \\Delta x}{R_p} $$\n    - The reaction-limited surface current, $i_{\\mathrm{rxn,surf}}$, is given by the Butler-Volmer equation for a maximum allowed overpotential $\\eta_{\\max}$:\n      $$ i_{\\mathrm{rxn,surf}}(T, \\eta_{\\max}) = 2 i_0(T) \\sinh\\left(\\frac{F \\eta_{\\max}}{2 R T}\\right) $$\n\n3.  **Specific Surface Area:** The available reaction area is quantified by the specific surface area, $a_s$, calculated for spherical particles:\n    $$ a_s = \\frac{3 \\epsilon_s}{R_p} $$\n\nThe program implements this sequence: calculate $a_s$, then for each test case, calculate the temperature-dependent $D_s(T)$ and $i_0(T)$, use them to find the limiting surface currents $i_{\\mathrm{diff,surf}}$ and $i_{\\mathrm{rxn,surf}}$, and finally compute the two potential required thicknesses. The maximum of these two is the optimal thickness, $L_{\\mathrm{opt}}$. The dominant regime is identified by which of the two required thicknesses is larger, and feasibility is checked against $L_{\\max}$.",
