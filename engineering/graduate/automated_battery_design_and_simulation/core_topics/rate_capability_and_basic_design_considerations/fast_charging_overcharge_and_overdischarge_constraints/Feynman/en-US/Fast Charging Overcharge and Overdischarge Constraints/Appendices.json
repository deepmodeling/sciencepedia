            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an adjusted voltage cap for an automated battery charging optimizer. The optimizer's model for terminal voltage is based on an incorrect Open-Circuit Voltage (OCV), leading to a systematic error, or bias, in its voltage prediction. To ensure the true terminal voltage does not exceed the absolute hardware limit, this bias must be accounted for.\n\nLet us define the relevant physical quantities with their symbols.\nThe true terminal voltage during charging at a State of Charge (SOC) $z$ is denoted by $V_{\\text{true}, \\text{chg}}(z)$.\nThe optimizer's predicted terminal voltage is $V_{\\text{pred}, \\text{chg}}(z)$.\nThe charge-direction OCV is $U_{\\text{chg}}(z)$, and the discharge-direction OCV is $U_{\\text{dchg}}(z)$.\nThe internal resistance is $R$, and the constant charging current is $I_{\\text{chg}}$.\nThe absolute hardware voltage cap is $V_{\\text{cap}}$.\n\nThe problem states that the terminal voltage is the sum of the OCV and the ohmic drop. For charging, the current flows into the positive terminal, so the ohmic drop adds to the OCV.\n\nThe true terminal voltage during charging is determined by the charge-direction OCV, $U_{\\text{chg}}(z)$. The governing equation is:\n$$\nV_{\\text{true}, \\text{chg}}(z) = U_{\\text{chg}}(z) + I_{\\text{chg}} R\n$$\n\nThe optimizer, however, erroneously uses the discharge-direction OCV, $U_{\\text{dchg}}(z)$, to predict the terminal voltage during a charging event. Its prediction is therefore:\n$$\nV_{\\text{pred}, \\text{chg}}(z) = U_{\\text{dchg}}(z) + I_{\\text{chg}} R\n$$\n\nThe problem defines the relationship between the charge and discharge OCVs through the hysteresis gap, $\\Delta U_{\\text{hys}}(z)$. The charge OCV is higher than the discharge OCV at the same SOC $z$:\n$$\nU_{\\text{chg}}(z) = U_{\\text{dchg}}(z) + \\Delta U_{\\text{hys}}(z)\n$$\n\nNow, we can derive the bias in the optimizer's prediction.
