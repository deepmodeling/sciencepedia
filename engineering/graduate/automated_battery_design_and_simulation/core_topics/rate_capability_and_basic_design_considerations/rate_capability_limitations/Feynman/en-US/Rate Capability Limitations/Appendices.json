            "solution": "The problem requires a first-principles derivation of the relationship between kinetic overpotential, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{kin}}$, and applied current density, $i$, for a symmetric electrochemical reaction. This relationship is a specific form of the Butler-Volmer equation. The net current density, $i$, across the electrode-electrolyte interface is the difference between the anodic (oxidation) current density, $i_a$, and the cathodic (reduction) current density, $i_c$.\n\n$$i = i_a - i_c$$\n\nThe rates of the anodic and cathodic reactions depend exponentially on the overpotential, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{kin}}$, which is the deviation of the electrode potential from its equilibrium value. These dependencies are described as follows:\n\n$$i_a = i_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{(1-\\alpha) n F \\eta_{\\mathrm{kin}}}{RT}\\right)$$\n$$i_c = i_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha n F \\eta_{\\mathrm{kin}}}{RT}\\right)$$\n\nHere, $i_0$ is the exchange current density, $n$ is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction, $F$ is the Faraday constant ($96485\\,\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}}$), $R$ is the ideal gas constant ($8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$), $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $\\alpha$ is the charge-transfer coefficient.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the equation for the net current density yields the full Butler-Volmer equation:\n\n$$i = i_0 \\left[ \\exp\\left(\\frac{(1-\\alpha) n F \\eta_{\\mathrm{kin}}}{RT}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha n F \\eta_{\\mathrm{kin}}}{RT}\\right) \\right]$$\n\nThe problem specifies a symmetric reaction, which implies that the energy barrier is symmetric with respect to potential. This is mathematically represented by a charge-transfer coefficient $\\alpha = 0.5$. Substituting $\\alpha = 0.5$ into the Butler-Volmer equation simplifies it considerably:\n\n$$i = i_0 \\left[ \\exp\\left(\\frac{(1-0.5) n F \\eta_{\\mathrm{kin}}}{RT}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0.5 n F \\eta_{\\mathrm{kin}}}{RT}\\right) \\right]$$\n$$i = i_0 \\left[ \\exp\\left(\\frac{0.5 n F \\eta_{\\mathrm{kin}}}{RT}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0.5 n F \\eta_{\\mathrm{kin}}}{RT}\\right) \\right]$$\n\nThis expression is directly related to the definition of the hyperbolic sine function, $\\sinh(x) = \\frac{\\exp(x) - \\exp(-x)}{2}$. We can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$$i = 2 i_0 \\left[ \\frac{\\exp\\left(\\frac{n F \\eta_{\\mathrm{kin}}}{2RT}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{n F \\eta_{\\mathrm{kin}}}{2RT}\\right)}{2} \\right]$$\n$$i = 2 i_0 \\sinh\\left(\\frac{n F \\eta_{\\mathrm{kin}}}{2RT}\\right)$$\n\nThis is the derived relationship between current density and kinetic overpotential for a symmetric reaction.

The kinetic overpotential is $\\eta_{\\mathrm{kin}} \\approx 118.8\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an expression for the effective macroscopic resistivity of a composite cathode and a subsequent calculation of the electronic voltage drop across it under specified conditions.\n\nThe total voltage drop is due to the electronic resistance of the carbon additive network. This resistance arises from two sources in series: the intrinsic resistance of the carbon material itself and the contact resistance at the junctions between carbon particles.\n\nLet the total geometric cross-sectional area of the electrode be $A$. The carbon additive has a volume fraction $\\phi_{c}$. Assuming a uniform distribution, the cross-sectional area available for electron conduction through the carbon network is $A_{c} = \\phi_{c} A$. The externally applied current density is $i$, so the total current flowing through the electrode is $I = i A$.
