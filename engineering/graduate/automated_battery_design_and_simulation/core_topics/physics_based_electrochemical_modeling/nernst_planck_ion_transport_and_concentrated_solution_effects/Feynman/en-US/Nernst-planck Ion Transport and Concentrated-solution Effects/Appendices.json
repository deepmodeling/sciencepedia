This polarization leads to performance losses (overpotential) and can limit the battery's power density. The extent of this polarization is critically dependent on the transport properties of the electrolyte, which are significantly affected by ion association in concentrated solutions.\n\nThe foundational framework is migration-dominated Nernst–Planck transport. In a simple binary electrolyte, the key parameter governing concentration polarization is the cation transference number, $t_{+}$, which represents the fraction of current carried by the cation. A value of $t_{+}$ far from $0.5$ (e.g., $t_{+} \\to 1$ or $t_{+} \\to 0$) indicates that one ion is much more mobile than the other, leading to a rapid buildup of salt concentration gradients to maintain charge neutrality.\n\nWhen significant ion pairing and charged associations occur, the situation becomes more complex.\n\n1.  **Effect of Neutral Ion Pairs:** The formation of neutral ion pairs (e.g., $\\mathrm{LiA}$) removes charge carriers from the solution. These neutral species do not migrate in an electric field and thus do not contribute directly to the ionic current. However, they do contribute to the total salt concentration. When galvanostatic operation creates a gradient in the concentration of charged species, it also creates a gradient in the total salt concentration. This gradient drives the diffusion of neutral ion pairs from regions of high concentration to low concentration. This diffusive flux provides an additional, non-migratory pathway for salt transport, which acts to relax or mitigate the concentration polarization established by the electric field. In essence, the diffusion of neutral pairs enhances the effective salt diffusion coefficient, helping to maintain a more uniform concentration profile and reduce polarization losses.\n\n2.  **Effect of Charged Associations (Triple Ions):** The formation of charged clusters, such as positive ($\\mathrm{Li}_2\\mathrm{A}^{+}$) and negative ($\\mathrm{Li}\\mathrm{A}_2^{-}$) triple-ions, fundamentally alters the partitioning of ionic current. While positive triple-ions behave like larger, slower cations, negative triple-ions introduce a more dramatic effect. A negative triple-ion like $\\mathrm{Li}\\mathrm{A}_2^{-}$ contains a cation ($\\mathrm{Li}^{+}$) but has a net negative charge. Consequently, it migrates toward the anode (positive electrode) and away from the cathode (negative electrode) in a process often termed \"wrong-way\" transport. This migration opposes the desired flux of free cations toward the cathode.\n\nThis \"wrong-way\" transport can drastically alter the apparent cation transference number ($t_{+}^{\\mathrm{app}}$ as calculated above, or more formally, the transference number with respect to the solvent velocity, $t_{+}^0$). If the flux of cations within negatively charged clusters moving toward the anode is substantial, it can significantly reduce the net flux of cations toward the cathode. In extreme cases of high association and high mobility of negative clusters, the apparent transference number can even become negative. A negative transference number implies that for every unit of charge passed, there is a net accumulation of salt at the negative electrode, leading to severe concentration polarization, rapid voltage drops, and potential salt precipitation, which severely limits battery performance and life. Therefore, while neutral pair formation can be beneficial, the formation of negatively charged clusters is generally detrimental to minimizing concentration polarization.",
