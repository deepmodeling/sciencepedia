            "problem": "In the Doyle–Fuller–Newman (DFN) model of porous electrodes, interfacial electrochemical reaction kinetics at the solid–electrolyte interface are described by the Butler–Volmer relation, which couples the overpotential to the interfacial current density. Consider a single-electron transfer reaction ($n=1$) with symmetric charge-transfer coefficients $\\alpha_{a}=\\alpha_{c}=0.5$ at uniform temperature $T$. Starting from first principles of electron transfer kinetics and the Butler–Volmer relation, derive the Tafel approximation for the anodic branch under the large positive overpotential assumption.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the anodic Tafel approximation from the Butler-Volmer equation and the subsequent calculation of the relative error of this approximation at a specified overpotential. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nThe analysis begins with the general form of the Butler-Volmer equation, which describes the current density $i_{\\text{BV}}$ as a function of the overpotential $\\eta$ at the solid-electrolyte interface:\n$$\ni_{\\text{BV}}(\\eta) = i_{0} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{a} n F \\eta}{RT}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha_{c} n F \\eta}{RT}\\right) \\right)\n$$\nHere, $i_{0}$ is the exchange current density, $\\alpha_{a}$ and $\\alpha_{c}$ are the anodic and cathodic charge-transfer coefficients, respectively, $n$ is the number of electrons transferred in the elementary reaction step, $F$ is the Faraday constant, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe problem provides specific values for the parameters: a single-electron transfer reaction, so $n=1$, and symmetric charge-transfer coefficients, $\\alpha_{a} = \\alpha_{c} = 0.5$. Substituting these values into the general equation yields the specific form for this system:\n$$\ni_{\\text{BV}}(\\eta) = i_{0} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{0.5 F \\eta}{RT}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0.5 F \\eta}{RT}\\right) \\right)\n$$\n\nThe Tafel approximation is derived under the assumption of a large overpotential. For the anodic branch, this corresponds to a large positive overpotential, $\\eta \\gg 0$. In this regime, the argument of the first exponential term, $\\frac{0.5 F \\eta}{RT}$, is large and positive, while the argument of the second exponential term, $-\\frac{0.5 F \\eta}{RT}$, is large and negative. Consequently, the second term becomes negligible compared to the first:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(\\frac{0.5 F \\eta}{RT}\\right) \\gg \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0.5 F \\eta}{RT}\\right)\n$$\nBy neglecting the second (cathodic) term, we obtain the anodic Tafel approximation for the current density, $i_{\\text{Tafel}}(\\eta)$:\n$$\ni_{\\text{Tafel}}(\\eta) = i_{0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{0.5 F \\eta}{RT}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe next step is to quantify the dimensionless relative error, $E(\\eta)$, of this approximation. The error is defined as:\n$$\nE(\\eta) \\equiv \\frac{\\left|i_{\\text{Tafel}}(\\eta)-i_{\\text{BV}}(\\eta)\\right|}{i_{\\text{BV}}(\\eta)}\n$$\nFor a positive overpotential $\\eta > 0$, the anodic current is larger than the cathodic current, so $i_{\\text{BV}}(\\eta) > 0$. The Tafel approximation $i_{\\text{Tafel}}(\\eta)$ is derived by omitting a positive term (the magnitude of the cathodic current), so $i_{\\text{Tafel}}(\\eta)$ is always greater than $i_{\\text{BV}}(\\eta)$. Therefore, the absolute value can be removed:\n$$\nE(\\eta) = \\frac{i_{\\text{Tafel}}(\\eta)-i_{\\text{BV}}(\\eta)}{i_{\\text{BV}}(\\eta)} = \\frac{i_{\\text{Tafel}}(\\eta)}{i_{\\text{BV}}(\\eta)} - 1\n$$\nWe substitute the derived expressions for $i_{\\text{Tafel}}(\\eta)$ and $i_{\\text{BV}}(\\eta)$:\n$$\nE(\\eta) = \\frac{i_{0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{0.5 F \\eta}{RT}\\right)}{i_{0} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{0.5 F \\eta}{RT}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0.5 F \\eta}{RT}\\right) \\right)} - 1\n$$\nThe exchange current density $i_{0}$ cancels out, as stated in the problem:\n$$\nE(\\eta) = \\frac{\\exp\\left(\\frac{0.5 F \\eta}{RT}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{0.5 F \\eta}{RT}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0.5 F \\eta}{RT}\\right)} - 1\n$$\nTo simplify this expression, we can multiply the numerator and denominator of the fraction by $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{0.5 F \\eta}{RT}\\right)$:\n$$\nE(\\eta) = \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{F \\eta}{RT}\\right)} - 1\n$$\nCombining the terms over a common denominator gives the final analytical expression for the relative error:\n$$\nE(\\eta) = \\frac{1 - \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{F \\eta}{RT}\\right)\\right)}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{F \\eta}{RT}\\right)} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{F \\eta}{RT}\\right)}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{F \\eta}{RT}\\right)}\n$$\nNow, we must evaluate this expression numerically for the given conditions:\n$\\eta = 100\\ \\text{mV} = 0.1\\ \\text{V}$\n$T = 298\\ \\text{K}$\n$R = 8.314462618\\ \\text{J mol}^{-1}\\ \\text{K}^{-1}$\n$F = 96485.33212\\ \\text{C mol}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we compute the dimensionless exponent $\\frac{F \\eta}{RT}$:\n$$\n\\frac{F \\eta}{RT} = \\frac{(96485.33212\\ \\text{C mol}^{-1}) \\times (0.1\\ \\text{V})}{(8.314462618\\ \\text{J mol}^{-1}\\ \\text{K}^{-1}) \\times (298\\ \\text{K})} \\approx \\frac{9648.533212}{2477.57086} \\approx 3.894376\n$$\nLet $x = \\frac{F \\eta}{RT}$. The error is $E = \\frac{\\exp(-x)}{1 - \\exp(-x)}$.\nUsing the calculated value of $x$:\n$$\n\\exp(-x) \\approx \\exp(-3.894376) \\approx 0.0203565\n$$\nNow, we substitute this into the error expression:\n$$\nE \\approx \\frac{0.0203565}{1 - 0.0203565} = \\frac{0.0203565}{0.9796435} \\approx 0.02077958\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $2$, $0$, $7$, $7$. The fifth significant figure is $9$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth significant figure.\n$$\nE \\approx 0.02078\n$$",

Your program must derive and compute quantities starting from fundamental transport laws and widely accepted porous-media scalings, and must strictly avoid relying on uninterpreted heuristic shortcuts.\n\nAssume a one-dimensional, isothermal separator under the following DFN model assumptions: electroneutrality holds, the electrolyte is a binary dilute solution with constant cation transference number, and the porous separator is homogeneous and isotropic.

            "solution": "The problem statement is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in established principles of electrochemical transport and porous media theory, is well-posed with all necessary parameters provided, and is objective and formalizable. We proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe analysis focuses on quantifying transport limitations in a lithium-ion battery separator, specifically the impact of changing porosity $\\varepsilon$. The separator is treated as a one-dimensional, homogeneous porous medium of thickness $L_s$. All calculations are performed under the assumptions of the Doyle-Fuller-Newman (DFN) model for a dilute, binary electrolyte.\n\n**1. Derivation of Effective Transport Properties**\n\nIn a porous medium, the effective transport properties are reduced compared to their bulk values due to the reduced volume fraction available for transport and the increased path length (tortuosity) that ions and molecules must travel. A common and physically justified model relating an effective property $X_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ to its bulk value $X$ and the porosity $\\varepsilon$ is the Bruggeman relation, which takes the form of a power law:\n$$X_{\\mathrm{eff}} = X \\varepsilon^b$$\nwhere $b$ is a structural or tortuosity exponent. This exponent is an empirical parameter that depends on the geometry of the porous structure, with a classical value of $b=1.5$ for a packing of uniform spheres.\n\nApplying this relation to the electrolyte salt diffusivity $D$ and ionic conductivity $\\kappa$:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{eff}} = D \\varepsilon^b$$\n$$\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\kappa \\varepsilon^b$$\n\nThe ratio of an effective property at porosity $\\varepsilon_2 = 0.3$ to that at porosity $\\varepsilon_1 = 0.4$ is therefore:\n$$\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{eff}}(\\varepsilon_2)}{D_{\\mathrm{eff}}(\\varepsilon_1)} = \\frac{D \\varepsilon_2^b}{D \\varepsilon_1^b} = \\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon_2}{\\varepsilon_1}\\right)^b = \\left(\\frac{0.3}{0.4}\\right)^b = 0.75^b$$\n$$\\frac{\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}}(\\varepsilon_2)}{\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}}(\\varepsilon_1)} = \\frac{\\kappa \\varepsilon_2^b}{\\kappa \\varepsilon_1^b} = \\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon_2}{\\varepsilon_1}\\right)^b = \\left(\\frac{0.3}{0.4}\\right)^b = 0.75^b$$\nThese expressions will be used to compute the first two required outputs.\n\n**2. Derivation of Concentration Polarization**\n\nUnder steady-state current flow $i$ through the separator, where no reactions occur, mass conservation combined with transport physics dictates the concentration profile. In dilute solution theory, the steady-state concentration gradient is established to balance diffusion and migration. The standard expression derived from Nernst-Planck equations under these conditions is:\n$$\\frac{dc}{dx} = -\\frac{i(1-t_+^0)}{F D_{\\mathrm{eff}}}$$\nIntegrating this expression across the separator thickness $L_s$ from the anode side ($x=0$) to the cathode side ($x=L_s$) yields the total concentration change $\\Delta c$:\n$$\\Delta c = c(L_s) - c(0) = \\int_0^{L_s} \\left( -\\frac{i(1-t_+^0)}{F D_{\\mathrm{eff}}} \\right) dx = -\\frac{i(1-t_+^0)L_s}{F D_{\\mathrm{eff}}}$$\nThe magnitude of this concentration change, known as concentration polarization, is divided by the bulk concentration $c_0$ to obtain the required dimensionless fraction, $f_c$:\n$$f_c = \\frac{|\\Delta c|}{c_0} = \\frac{i(1-t_+^0)L_s}{c_0 F D_{\\mathrm{eff}}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$f_c(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{i(1-t_+^0)L_s}{c_0 F D \\varepsilon^b}$$\nThis equation is used to compute the third and fourth required outputs.\n\n**3. Derivation of Ohmic Potential Drop**\n\nThe ionic Ohm's law in a porous medium relates the ionic current density $i$ to the gradient of the electrolyte potential $\\phi_e$. Ignoring the diffusional potential for the definition of \"ohmic drop\", we have:\n$$i = -\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\frac{d\\phi_e}{dx}$$\nThe potential drop across the separator, $V_{\\mathrm{ohmic}}$, is the magnitude of the change in $\\phi_e$ across the thickness $L_s$:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{ohmic}} = |\\Delta \\phi_e| = \\left| \\int_0^{L_s} d\\phi_e \\right| = \\left| \\int_0^{L_s} \\left(-\\frac{i}{\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}}}\\right) dx \\right| = \\frac{i L_s}{\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{ohmic}}(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{i L_s}{\\kappa \\varepsilon^b}$$\n\n**4. Derivation of Rate Capability Metric, $i_{\\max}$**\n\nThe maximum allowable current density, $i_{\\max}$, is defined by two constraints:\n1. The concentration polarization fraction $f_c$ must not exceed a limit $f_{\\lim}$:\n$$f_c = \\frac{i(1-t_+^0)L_s}{c_0 F D \\varepsilon^b} \\le f_{\\lim} \\implies i \\le \\frac{f_{\\lim} c_0 F D \\varepsilon^b}{(1-t_+^0)L_s} \\equiv i_{c, \\mathrm{lim}}$$\n2. The ohmic potential drop $V_{\\mathrm{ohmic}}$ must not exceed a limit $V_{\\lim}$:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{ohmic}} = \\frac{i L_s}{\\kappa \\varepsilon^b} \\le V_{\\lim} \\implies i \\le \\frac{V_{\\lim} \\kappa \\varepsilon^b}{L_s} \\equiv i_{V, \\mathrm{lim}}$$\nThe rate capability $i_{\\max}$ is the largest current density satisfying both conditions, which is the minimum of the two individual limits:\n$$i_{\\max}(\\varepsilon) = \\min(i_{c, \\mathrm{lim}}, i_{V, \\mathrm{lim}}) = \\min\\left( \\frac{f_{\\lim} c_0 F D \\varepsilon^b}{(1-t_+^0)L_s}, \\frac{V_{\\lim} \\kappa \\varepsilon^b}{L_s} \\right)$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$i_{\\max}(\\varepsilon) = \\varepsilon^b \\cdot \\min\\left( \\frac{f_{\\lim} c_0 F D}{(1-t_+^0)L_s}, \\frac{V_{\\lim} \\kappa}{L_s} \\right)$$\nThese expressions will be used to compute outputs five and six. The seventh output, the ratio $i_{\\max}(0.3)/i_{\\max}(0.4)$, is then:\n$$\\frac{i_{\\max}(0.3)}{i_{\\max}(0.4)} = \\frac{0.3^b}{0.4^b} = 0.75^b$$\n\nThese derived formulae provide a complete basis for the required computations.",

Use the following foundational bases without invoking any shortcut formulas:\n- Charge neutrality in the electrolyte, constant-valence transport, and the one-dimensional form of Ohm’s law for ionic conduction in porous media, together with the migration contribution from the Nernst–Planck equation, which collectively imply that the electrolyte current density $i_e$ depends on $\\partial \\phi_e / \\partial x$ and $\\partial \\ln c_e / \\partial x$.\n- The definition of overpotential $\\eta = \\phi_s - \\phi_e - U$ and the principle that changes in $\\phi_e$ at the reaction interface directly modify $\\eta$ when $\\phi_s$ and $U$ are held fixed.\n- A Bruggeman-type scaling for effective electrolyte conductivity $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\kappa(c_e)\\,\\varepsilon^{b}$, with $\\kappa(c_e)$ a concentration-dependent bulk conductivity.\n\nAssume the following scenario and modeling assumptions, consistent with DFN model practice at high-rate operation:\n- The cell is driven at a constant C-rate equal to $3$ C, so the applied areal current density is determined entirely by the electrode areal capacity.\n- Near the separator–positive electrode interface, the electrolyte experiences a thin depletion boundary layer of thickness $\\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}}$, across which the electrolyte concentration decreases monotonically from $c_0$ at the separator side to $c_0 - \\Delta c$ at the positive-electrode entrance. Outside this layer, the electrolyte concentration is uniform and equal to $c_0$.\n- Within this boundary layer, assume the electrolyte current density $i_e$ is approximately constant and equal to the applied areal current density.\n- The bulk electrolyte conductivity scales as $\\kappa(c_e) = \\kappa_0 \\left( \\dfrac{c_e}{c_0} \\right)^s$, with exponent $s$ reflecting nonideal concentration dependence, and the effective conductivity in the porous medium is $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}}(x) = \\kappa(c_e(x))\\,\\varepsilon^b$.\n- The migration contribution uses the thermodynamic factor equal to unity (activity coefficient variation neglected), and the cation transference number in the electrolyte is $t_+$.\n- The contribution of electrolyte depletion to the cell overpotential at the interface is defined as the incremental increase in $\\eta$ at the reaction surface due solely to the change in $\\phi_e$ caused by the boundary-layer depletion, compared with the baseline case with uniform concentration $c_e(x) = c_0$ over the same thickness $\\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}}$.\n\nStarting from the foundational bases listed above, derive a computable expression for the incremental contribution of electrolyte depletion to the interfacial overpotential at $3$ C in terms of the parameters $(\\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}}, c_0, \\Delta c, \\varepsilon, b, \\kappa_0, s, t_+, T)$ and the applied areal current density determined from the areal capacity. Implement this expression as a program and evaluate it for the following test suite. All physical quantities must be expressed in coherent International System of Units (SI), and the outputs must be expressed in volts (V), rounded to $6$ decimal places.\n\nLet the applied areal current density at $3$ C be calculated from the areal capacity $Q_{\\mathrm{areal}}$ in $\\mathrm{mAh}/\\mathrm{cm}^2$ via\n$$\ni_{\\mathrm{app}} = 30\\,Q_{\\mathrm{areal}} \\quad \\text{in} \\quad \\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{m}^2,\n$$\nusing the conversion $1\\,\\mathrm{mA}/\\mathrm{cm}^2 = 10\\,\\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{m}^2$ and the factor $3$ for $3$ C.\n\nUse the universal constants $R = 8.314\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$ and $F = 96485\\,\\mathrm{C}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n\nTest suite parameters:\n- Case A (happy path): $Q_{\\mathrm{areal}} = 4.0\\,\\mathrm{mAh}/\\mathrm{cm}^2$, $c_0 = 1000.0\\,\\mathrm{mol}/\\mathrm{m}^3$, $\\Delta c = 200.0\\,\\mathrm{mol}/\\mathrm{m}^3$, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}} = 2.0\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\varepsilon = 0.40$, $b = 1.5$, $\\kappa_0 = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{S}/\\mathrm{m}$, $s = 1.0$, $t_+ = 0.38$, $T = 298.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n- Case B (near-uniform concentration boundary): $Q_{\\mathrm{areal}} = 4.0\\,\\mathrm{mAh}/\\mathrm{cm}^2$, $c_0 = 1000.0\\,\\mathrm{mol}/\\mathrm{m}^3$, $\\Delta c = 20.0\\,\\mathrm{mol}/\\mathrm{m}^3$, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}} = 2.0\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\varepsilon = 0.40$, $b = 1.5$, $\\kappa_0 = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{S}/\\mathrm{m}$, $s = 1.0$, $t_+ = 0.38$, $T = 298.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n- Case C (severe depletion and lower conductivity): $Q_{\\mathrm{areal}} = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{mAh}/\\mathrm{cm}^2$, $c_0 = 1000.0\\,\\mathrm{mol}/\\mathrm{m}^3$, $\\Delta c = 400.0\\,\\mathrm{mol}/\\mathrm{m}^3$, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}} = 5.0\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\varepsilon = 0.35$, $b = 1.5$, $\\kappa_0 = 0.9\\,\\mathrm{S}/\\mathrm{m}$, $s = 1.0$, $t_+ = 0.38$, $T = 298.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n- Case D (nonlinear conductivity exponent and higher transference number): $Q_{\\mathrm{areal}} = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{mAh}/\\mathrm{cm}^2$, $c_0 = 1200.0\\,\\mathrm{mol}/\\mathrm{m}^3$, $\\Delta c = 300.0\\,\\mathrm{mol}/\\mathrm{m}^3$, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}} = 1.0\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\varepsilon = 0.45$, $b = 1.5$, $\\kappa_0 = 1.1\\,\\mathrm{S}/\\mathrm{m}$, $s = 0.8$, $t_+ = 0.50$, $T = 308.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the depletion-induced incremental overpotential for the four cases as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets in volts, rounded to $6$ decimal places, for example, $\\left[\\eta_A,\\eta_B,\\eta_C,\\eta_D\\right]$ printed as $\\left[\\text{value}_A,\\text{value}_B,\\text{value}_C,\\text{value}_D\\right]$.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of electrochemical transport phenomena, specifically the Doyle-Fuller-Newman (DFN) model, and is well-posed, objective, and complete, assuming a linear concentration profile as the most reasonable interpretation of a monotonic decrease across a thin boundary layer.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the incremental contribution of electrolyte depletion to the interfacial overpotential, denoted as $\\Delta\\eta_{\\mathrm{dep}}$. This quantity is defined as the increase in overpotential $\\eta$ at the reaction surface (positive-electrode entrance, $x=\\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}}$) due to electrolyte concentration depletion, compared to a baseline case with a uniform concentration $c_e(x) = c_0$.\n\nThe overpotential is given by $\\eta = \\phi_s - \\phi_e - U$. Since the solid-phase potential $\\phi_s$ and the open-circuit potential $U$ are considered fixed, the change in overpotential is due solely to the change in electrolyte potential $\\phi_e$ at the reaction surface ($x=\\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}}$):\n$$\n\\Delta\\eta_{\\mathrm{dep}} = \\eta_{\\mathrm{dep}} - \\eta_{\\mathrm{base}} = (\\phi_s - \\phi_{e, \\mathrm{dep}}(\\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}}) - U) - (\\phi_s - \\phi_{e, \\mathrm{base}}(\\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}}) - U) = -(\\phi_{e, \\mathrm{dep}}(\\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}}) - \\phi_{e, \\mathrm{base}}(\\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}}))\n$$\nWe can set a reference potential at the separator side of the boundary layer, $\\phi_e(0) = 0$, for both cases. The potential at the electrode interface is then found by integrating the potential gradient across the boundary layer of thickness $\\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}}$.\n\nThe governing equation for the electrolyte current density $i_e$ in a concentrated binary electrolyte, as per the foundations provided (concentrated-solution theory simplified for a thermodynamic factor of 1), is:\n$$\ni_e = -\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}}(x) \\frac{\\partial \\phi_e}{\\partial x} + \\frac{2 R T \\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}}(x)}{F}(1 - t_+) \\frac{\\partial \\ln c_e}{\\partial x}\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the temperature, $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $t_+$ is the cation transference number. We rearrange this to solve for the electrolyte potential gradient:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\phi_e}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{i_e}{\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}}(x)} + \\frac{2 R T}{F}(1 - t_+) \\frac{\\partial \\ln c_e}{\\partial x}\n$$\nWithin the boundary layer, we assume $i_e$ is constant and equal to the applied areal current density, $i_e = i_{\\mathrm{app}}$. The applied current density $i_{\\mathrm{app}}$ is calculated from the areal capacity $Q_{\\mathrm{areal}}$ according to the formula provided in the problem statement: $i_{\\mathrm{app}} = 30\\,Q_{\\mathrm{areal}}$, where $Q_{\\mathrm{areal}}$ is the numerical value in $\\mathrm{mAh}/\\mathrm{cm}^2$ and $i_{\\mathrm{app}}$ is in $\\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{m}^2$. Integrating from $x=0$ to $x=\\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}}$ gives the potential drop across the layer:\n$$\n\\phi_e(\\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}}) = \\int_0^{\\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}}} \\frac{\\partial \\phi_e}{\\partial x} dx = \\int_0^{\\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}}} \\left( -\\frac{i_{\\mathrm{app}}}{\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}}(x)} \\right) dx + \\int_0^{\\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}}} \\left( \\frac{2 R T}{F}(1 - t_+) \\frac{\\partial \\ln c_e}{\\partial x} \\right) dx\n$$\nThe first term is the ohmic potential drop, $\\Delta\\phi_{\\mathrm{ohm}}$, and the second is the diffusional potential drop, $\\Delta\\phi_{\\mathrm{diff}}$.\n$$\n\\Delta\\phi_{\\mathrm{diff}} = \\frac{2 R T}{F}(1 - t_+) \\int_{c_e(0)}^{c_e(\\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}})} d(\\ln c_e) = \\frac{2 R T}{F}(1 - t_+) \\ln\\left(\\frac{c_e(\\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}})}{c_e(0)}\\right)\n$$\nIn the depletion case, $c_e(0) = c_0$ and $c_e(\\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}}) = c_0 - \\Delta c$.\nIn the baseline case, $c_e(x)=c_0$, so $\\frac{\\partial \\ln c_e}{\\partial x} = 0$, and $\\Delta\\phi_{\\mathrm{diff, base}} = 0$.\n\nThe incremental overpotential can be decomposed as:\n$$\n\\Delta\\eta_{\\mathrm{dep}} = -[(\\Delta\\phi_{\\mathrm{ohm, dep}} + \\Delta\\phi_{\\mathrm{diff, dep}}) - (\\Delta\\phi_{\\mathrm{ohm, base}} + \\Delta\\phi_{\\mathrm{diff, base}})] = -(\\Delta\\phi_{\\mathrm{ohm, dep}} - \\Delta\\phi_{\\mathrm{ohm, base}}) - \\Delta\\phi_{\\mathrm{diff, dep}}\n$$\nLet's define the ohmic and diffusional contributions to the incremental overpotential:\n$\\Delta\\eta_{\\mathrm{ohm}} = -(\\Delta\\phi_{\\mathrm{ohm, dep}} - \\Delta\\phi_{\\mathrm{ohm, base}})$\n$\\Delta\\eta_{\\mathrm{diff}} = - \\Delta\\phi_{\\mathrm{diff, dep}}$\nSo, $\\Delta\\eta_{\\mathrm{dep}} = \\Delta\\eta_{\\mathrm{ohm}} + \\Delta\\eta_{\\mathrm{diff}}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the diffusional contribution:\n$$\n\\Delta\\eta_{\\mathrm{diff}} = - \\frac{2 R T}{F}(1 - t_+) \\ln\\left(\\frac{c_0 - \\Delta c}{c_0}\\right) = - \\frac{2 R T}{F}(1 - t_+) \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{\\Delta c}{c_0}\\right)\n$$\nThis term is positive since $\\Delta c > 0$, causing the logarithmic term to be negative.\n\nNext, we calculate the ohmic contribution. We assume a linear concentration profile across the boundary layer, $c_e(x) = c_0 - \\frac{\\Delta c}{\\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}}}x$. The effective conductivity is $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}}(x) = \\kappa_0 \\varepsilon^b \\left(\\frac{c_e(x)}{c_0}\\right)^s = \\kappa_0 \\varepsilon^b \\left(1 - \\frac{\\Delta c}{c_0} \\frac{x}{\\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}}}\\right)^s$.\nThe ohmic potential drop in the depletion case is:\n$$\n\\Delta\\phi_{\\mathrm{ohm, dep}} = -i_{\\mathrm{app}} \\int_0^{\\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}}} \\frac{dx}{\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}}(x)} = -\\frac{i_{\\mathrm{app}}}{\\kappa_0 \\varepsilon^b} \\int_0^{\\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}}} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\Delta c}{c_0} \\frac{x}{\\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}}}\\right)^{-s} dx\n$$\nIn the baseline case, $c_e(x) = c_0$, so $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff, base}} = \\kappa_0 \\varepsilon^b$.\n$$\n\\Delta\\phi_{\\mathrm{ohm, base}} = -i_{\\mathrm{app}} \\int_0^{\\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}}} \\frac{dx}{\\kappa_0 \\varepsilon^b} = -\\frac{i_{\\mathrm{app}} \\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}}}{\\kappa_0 \\varepsilon^b}\n$$\nThe ohmic contribution to the incremental overpotential is:\n$$\n\\Delta\\eta_{\\mathrm{ohm}} = -(\\Delta\\phi_{\\mathrm{ohm, dep}} - \\Delta\\phi_{\\mathrm{ohm, base}}) = i_{\\mathrm{app}} \\left( \\int_0^{\\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}}} \\frac{dx}{\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}}(x)} - \\frac{\\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}}}{\\kappa_0 \\varepsilon^b} \\right) = \\frac{i_{\\mathrm{app}}}{\\kappa_0 \\varepsilon^b} \\left( \\int_0^{\\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}}} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\Delta c}{c_0} \\frac{x}{\\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}}}\\right)^{-s} dx - \\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}} \\right)\n$$\nWe evaluate the integral. Let $A = \\frac{\\Delta c}{c_0}$ and $y = \\frac{x}{\\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}}}$, so $dx = \\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}} dy$.\n$$\n\\int_0^{\\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}}} (1 - A \\frac{x}{\\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}}})^{-s} dx = \\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}} \\int_0^1 (1 - Ay)^{-s} dy\n$$\nFor the case $s=1$:\n$$\n\\int_0^1 (1 - Ay)^{-1} dy = \\left[ \\frac{\\ln(1 - Ay)}{-A} \\right]_0^1 = -\\frac{\\ln(1 - A)}{A}\n$$\nFor the case $s \\neq 1$:\n$$\n\\int_0^1 (1 - Ay)^{-s} dy = \\left[ \\frac{(1 - Ay)^{-s+1}}{(-s+1)(-A)} \\right]_0^1 = \\frac{(1-A)^{1-s} - 1}{A(s-1)}\n$$\nSubstituting these back into the expression for $\\Delta\\eta_{\\mathrm{ohm}}$:\nFor $s=1$, let $A = \\Delta c / c_0$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\eta_{\\mathrm{ohm}} = \\frac{i_{\\mathrm{app}} \\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}}}{\\kappa_0 \\varepsilon^b} \\left( -\\frac{1}{A} \\ln(1 - A) - 1 \\right)\n$$\nFor $s \\neq 1$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\eta_{\\mathrm{ohm}} = \\frac{i_{\\mathrm{app}} \\delta_{\\mathrm{bl}}}{\\kappa_0 \\varepsilon^b} \\left( \\frac{(1 - A)^{1-s} - 1}{A(s-1)} - 1 \\right)\n$$\nThe total incremental overpotential $\\Delta\\eta_{\\mathrm{dep}}$ is the sum $\\Delta\\eta_{\\mathrm{ohm}} + \\Delta\\eta_{\\mathrm{diff}}$.
