The film undergoes small, isotropic chemical expansion upon insertion of guest species with concentration $c$ (dimensionless mole fraction), which is uniform throughout the film thickness at any fixed time. The material parameters of the film (Young’s modulus $E$ and Poisson’s ratio $\\nu$) are independent of $c$ and time.

This involves examining the amplification of a single Fourier mode, $c_j^n = \\hat{c}^n(k) e^{I j k h}$ and $u_j^n = \\hat{u}^n(k) e^{I j k h}$, where $I = \\sqrt{-1}$ and $k$ is the wave number.\n\nFor the diffusion equation, substituting the Fourier mode into the discrete equation yields:\n$$\n\\hat{c}^{n+1} = \\hat{c}^n + \\frac{D \\Delta t}{h^2} \\hat{c}^n (e^{I k h} - 2 + e^{-I k h}) = \\hat{c}^n \\left( 1 + \\frac{2 D \\Delta t}{h^2} (\\cos(k h) - 1) \\right)\n$$\nUsing the half-angle identity $1 - \\cos(\\theta) = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$, the amplification factor $G_c(k) = \\hat{c}^{n+1}/\\hat{c}^n$ is:\n$$\nG_c(k) = 1 - \\frac{4D \\Delta t}{h^2} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k h}{2}\\right)\n$$\nFor stability, we require $|G_c(k)| \\le 1$ for all $k$. This is equivalent to $-1 \\le G_c(k) \\le 1$. The condition $G_c(k) \\le 1$ is always satisfied. The condition $G_c(k) \\ge -1$ implies:\n$$\n-1 \\le 1 - \\frac{4D \\Delta t}{h^2} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k h}{2}\\right) \\implies \\frac{4D \\Delta t}{h^2} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k h}{2}\\right) \\le 2\n$$\nThe most restrictive case occurs when $\\sin^2(k h/2) = 1$. This leads to the stability constraint for the diffusion update:\n$$\n\\frac{2D \\Delta t}{h^2} \\le 1 \\implies \\Delta t \\le \\frac{h^2}{2D}\n$$\n\nFor the wave equation, the stability of the explicit scheme is determined by its homogeneous part. The forcing term involving $c$ is evaluated at time level $n$ and does not influence the amplification factor of the homogeneous solution from step $n$ to $n+1$. Substituting the Fourier mode $u_j^n = (G_u)^n e^{I j k h}$ into the homogeneous part of the discretized wave equation gives a quadratic equation for the amplification factor $G_u$:\n$$\n(G_u)^2 - \\left( 2 - \\frac{4 E (\\Delta t)^2}{\\rho h^2} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k h}{2}\\right) \\right) G_u + 1 = 0\n$$\nFor the magnitude of the roots to be at most $1$, the coefficient of the linear term must have a magnitude less than or equal to $2$.\n$$\n\\left| 2 - \\frac{4 E (\\Delta t)^2}{\\rho h^2} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k h}{2}\\right) \\right| \\le 2\n$$\nThis implies:\n$$\n-2 \\le 2 - \\frac{4 E (\\Delta t)^2}{\\rho h^2} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k h}{2}\\right) \\le 2\n$$\nThe right-hand inequality is always satisfied. The left-hand inequality gives:\n$$\n\\frac{4 E (\\Delta t)^2}{\\rho h^2} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k h}{2}\\right) \\le 4\n$$\nDefining the speed of sound in the material as $v_s = \\sqrt{E/\\rho}$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{v_s \\Delta t}{h}\\right)^2 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k h}{2}\\right) \\le 1\n$$\nThe most restrictive case occurs when $\\sin^2(k h/2) = 1$. This yields the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) stability condition for the wave equation update:\n$$\n\\frac{v_s \\Delta t}{h} \\le 1 \\implies \\Delta t \\le \\frac{h}{v_s} = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{E/\\rho}}\n$$\n\nNow we introduce the accuracy constraints. The problem requires that the non-dimensional parameters for each process be at most a tolerance $\\delta$.\nFor the diffusion process, the dimensionless diffusive step size is $\\alpha = \\frac{D \\Delta t}{h^2}$. The accuracy constraint is:\n$$\n\\frac{D \\Delta t}{h^2} \\le \\delta \\implies \\Delta t \\le \\frac{\\delta h^2}{D}\n$$\nFor the elastic wave process, the Courant number is $CFL_u = \\frac{v_s \\Delta t}{h}$. The accuracy constraint is:\n$$\n\\frac{v_s \\Delta t}{h} \\le \\delta \\implies \\Delta t \\le \\frac{\\delta h}{v_s} = \\frac{\\delta h}{\\sqrt{E/\\rho}}\n$$\n\nIn summary, we have four constraints on the time step $\\Delta t$:\n1.  Diffusion Stability: $\\Delta t \\le \\frac{h^2}{2D}$\n2.  Elasticity Stability (CFL): $\\Delta t \\le \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{E/\\rho}}$\n3.  Diffusion Accuracy: $\\Delta t \\le \\frac{\\delta h^2}{D}$\n4.  Elasticity Accuracy: $\\Delta t \\le \\frac{\\delta h}{\\sqrt{E/\\rho}}$\n\nThe largest allowable global time step $\\Delta t_{max}$ must satisfy all four conditions. Thus, $\\Delta t_{max}$ is the minimum of these four upper bounds.\nGiven $\\delta = 5.0 \\times 10^{-2} = 0.05$, we note that $0.05  0.5$ and $0.05  1$. Therefore, the accuracy constraints (3 and 4) are stricter than their corresponding stability counterparts (1 and 2). We only need to consider the accuracy constraints:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{max} = \\min\\left( \\frac{\\delta h^2}{D}, \\frac{\\delta h}{\\sqrt{E/\\rho}} \\right)\n$$\nWe now substitute the given parameter values:\n$h = 5.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{m}$\n$D = 1.0 \\times 10^{-14}\\ \\text{m}^{2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n$E = 1.0 \\times 10^{11}\\ \\text{Pa}$\n$\\rho = 5.0 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$\n$\\delta = 5.0 \\times 10^{-2}$\n\nThe limit from the diffusion accuracy constraint is:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{limit, D} = \\frac{\\delta h^2}{D} = \\frac{(5.0 \\times 10^{-2})(5.0 \\times 10^{-6})^2}{1.0 \\times 10^{-14}} = \\frac{(5.0 \\times 10^{-2})(25.0 \\times 10^{-12})}{1.0 \\times 10^{-14}} = \\frac{1.25 \\times 10^{-12}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-14}} = 125\\ \\text{s}\n$$\nThe limit from the elasticity accuracy constraint requires the wave speed $v_s$:\n$$\nv_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{E}{\\rho}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{11}\\ \\text{Pa}}{5.0 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}}} = \\sqrt{2.0 \\times 10^7}\\ \\text{m/s} \\approx 4472.136\\ \\text{m/s}\n$$\nThe limit is then:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{limit, E} = \\frac{\\delta h}{\\sqrt{E/\\rho}} = \\frac{(5.0 \\times 10^{-2})(5.0 \\times 10^{-6})}{\\sqrt{2.0 \\times 10^7}} = \\frac{2.5 \\times 10^{-7}}{\\sqrt{20} \\times 10^3} = \\frac{2.5 \\times 10^{-10}}{\\sqrt{20}}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta t_{limit, E} \\approx \\frac{2.5 \\times 10^{-10}}{4.472136} \\approx 0.559017 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\text{s} = 5.59017 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\text{s}\n$$\nComparing the two limits:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{max} = \\min(125\\ \\text{s}, 5.59017 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\text{s}) = 5.59017 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\text{s}\n$$\nRounding the final result to four significant figures gives $5.590 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\text{s}$.",
