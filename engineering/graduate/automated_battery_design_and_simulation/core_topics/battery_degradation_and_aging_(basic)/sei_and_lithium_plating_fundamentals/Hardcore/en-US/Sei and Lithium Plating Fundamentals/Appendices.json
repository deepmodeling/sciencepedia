Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\nThe derivation begins with the provided constitutive relation for steady-state ionic conduction, which is the differential form of Ohm's law for an ionic conductor:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J} = -\\kappa_{\\mathrm{SEI}}\\nabla\\phi\n$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{J}$ is the ionic current density vector (in $\\mathrm{A/m^2}$), $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{SEI}}$ is the ionic conductivity (in $\\mathrm{S/m}$), and $\\nabla\\phi$ is the gradient of the electric potential (in $\\mathrm{V/m}$).\n\nThe problem assumes one-dimensional transport through a uniform SEI layer of thickness $L$ and area $A$. Let the transport direction be the $x$-axis. The potential gradient simplifies to $\\nabla\\phi = \\frac{d\\phi}{dx}\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}$. The current density vector is then $\\mathbf{J} = J_x\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}$.

The problem states that the measured total resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{SEI,tot}}$, comes from two identical SEI layers in series, one on each electrode. For resistors in series, the total resistance is the sum of the individual resistances.\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{SEI,tot}} = R_{\\mathrm{SEI,1}} + R_{\\mathrm{SEI,2}}\n$$\nSince the layers are identical, their thicknesses are both $L_{\\mathrm{per}}$, their conductivities are $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{SEI}}$, and their areas are $A$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the potential drop across a bilayer Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) and the subsequent calculation of the interfacial charge-transfer overpotential. The process begins with the fundamental principles of ion transport.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the SEI Potential Drop\n\nThe transport of ions in an electrolyte is described by the Nernst-Planck equation, which gives the flux $\\mathbf{N}_i$ of an ionic species $i$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{N}_i = -D_i \\nabla c_i - \\frac{z_i F}{R T} D_i c_i \\nabla \\phi + c_i \\mathbf{v}\n$$\nwhere $D_i$ is the diffusion coefficient, $c_i$ is the concentration, $z_i$ is the charge number, $F$ is the Faraday constant, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $\\phi$ is the electric potential, and $\\mathbf{v}$ is the bulk fluid velocity.\n\nThe problem statement provides several assumptions to simplify this general equation:\n1.  The transport is one-dimensional, along an axis $x$.\n2.  The medium is stationary, so there is no convection ($ \\mathbf{v} = 0 $).\n3.  The concentration gradient within each layer is negligible ($\\nabla c_i = 0$). This is the key assumption that justifies neglecting concentration polarization. The absence of a concentration gradient means there is no diffusive flux, and the potential contribution from differing concentrations at the boundaries (concentration overpotential) is zero.\n4.  The current is carried exclusively by lithium ions ($Li^+$), for which $z_{Li^+} = +1$.\n5.  There is no electronic conduction through the SEI.\n\nApplying these assumptions, the Nernst-Planck equation for lithium ion flux, $N_{Li^+}$, in the $x$-direction simplifies to:\n$$\nN_{Li^+} = - \\frac{F D_{Li^+} c_{Li^+}}{R T} \\frac{d\\phi}{dx}\n$$\nThe ionic current density, $j$, is related to the ionic flux by $j = z_{Li^+} F N_{Li^+}$. With $z_{Li^+} = 1$, we have $j = F N_{Li^+}$. Substituting this into the flux equation gives:\n$$\nj = - \\frac{F^2 D_{Li^+} c_{Li^+}}{R T} \\frac{d\\phi}{dx}\n$$\nThe term multiplying the potential gradient is the definition of ionic conductivity, $\\kappa$:\n$$\n\\kappa = \\frac{z_{Li^+}^2 F^2 D_{Li^+} c_{Li^+}}{R T} = \\frac{F^2 D_{Li^+} c_{Li^+}}{R T}\n$$\nwhere $c_{Li^+}$ is the concentration of mobile lithium ions within the SEI material, assumed to be constant within each layer. This substitution yields the differential form of Ohm's law for an ionic conductor:\n$$\nj = -\\kappa \\frac{d\\phi}{dx}\n$$\nFor a steady-state process ($ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0 $), the principle of charge conservation ($ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{j} = 0 $) requires the current density $j$ to be constant at every point $x$ through the SEI.\n\nWe now apply this to the bilayer system. Let the lithium metal/SEI interface be at $x=0$. The inner layer (layer $1$) occupies the region $0 \\le x \\le L_1$, and the outer layer (layer $2$) occupies $L_1  x \\le L_1+L_2$. Each layer has its own constant conductivity, $\\kappa_1$ and $\\kappa_2$, respectively.\n\nTo find the potential drop across each layer, we rearrange and integrate Ohm's law.\nFor the inner layer (layer $1$):\n$$\nd\\phi = -\\frac{j}{\\kappa_1} dx\n$$\n$$\n\\int_{\\phi(0)}^{\\phi(L_1)} d\\phi = \\int_{0}^{L_1} -\\frac{j}{\\kappa_1} dx\n$$\nThe potential drop across layer $1$ is $\\Delta \\phi_1 = \\phi(L_1) - \\phi(0) = -\\frac{j L_1}{\\kappa_1}$.\n\nFor the outer layer (layer $2$):\n$$\nd\\phi = -\\frac{j}{\\kappa_2} dx\n$$\n$$\n\\int_{\\phi(L_1)}^{\\phi(L_1+L_2)} d\\phi = \\int_{L_1}^{L_1+L_2} -\\frac{j}{\\kappa_2} dx\n$$\nThe potential drop across layer $2$ is $\\Delta \\phi_2 = \\phi(L_1+L_2) - \\phi(L_1) = -\\frac{j L_2}{\\kappa_2}$.\n\nThe total potential drop across the entire bilayer SEI, $\\Delta \\phi_{\\text{SEI}}$, is the sum of the potential drops across the individual layers. This demonstrates the series nature of the two layers; their resistances to ion flow add up, just as with electrical resistors in series.\n$$\n\\Delta \\phi_{\\text{SEI}} = \\Delta \\phi_1 + \\Delta \\phi_2 = \\left( \\phi(L_1) - \\phi(0) \\right) + \\left( \\phi(L_1+L_2) - \\phi(L_1) \\right) = \\phi(L_1+L_2) - \\phi(0)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\Delta \\phi_1$ and $\\Delta \\phi_2$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\phi_{\\text{SEI}} = -\\frac{j L_1}{\\kappa_1} - \\frac{j L_2}{\\kappa_2} = -j \\left( \\frac{L_1}{\\kappa_1} + \\frac{L_2}{\\kappa_2} \\right)\n$$\nThis is the desired expression for the one-dimensional steady-state potential drop across the bilayer SEI. The term in the parentheses is the total area-specific ionic resistance of the SEI, $R_{\\text{SEI}} = R_1 + R_2$, where $R_1=L_1/\\kappa_1$ and $R_2=L_2/\\kappa_2$.\n\n### Part 2: Calculation of the Charge-Transfer Overpotential\n\nThe problem defines the total electrode overpotential, $\\eta_{\\text{tot}}$, as being composed of the ohmic drop across the SEI and the interfacial charge-transfer overpotential, $\\eta_{\\text{ct}}$. Working with magnitudes, this relationship is:\n$$\n|\\eta_{\\text{tot}}| = |\\Delta \\phi_{\\text{SEI}}| + |\\eta_{\\text{ct}}|\n$$\nwhere $|\\Delta \\phi_{\\text{SEI}}|$ is the magnitude of the ohmic potential drop across the SEI. We are asked to compute $|\\eta_{\\text{ct}}|$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the area-specific resistances of the two layers using the provided data:\n$L_1 = 10 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\kappa_1 = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{S\\,m^{-1}}$\n$L_2 = 40 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\kappa_2 = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{S\\,m^{-1}}$\n\nResistance of the inner layer, $R_1$:\n$$\nR_1 = \\frac{L_1}{\\kappa_1} = \\frac{10 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}}{5.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{S\\,m^{-1}}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega \\cdot m^2}\n$$\nResistance of the outer layer, $R_2$:\n$$\nR_2 = \\frac{L_2}{\\kappa_2} = \\frac{40 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{S\\,m^{-1}}} = 4.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega \\cdot m^2}\n$$\nThe total area-specific resistance of the SEI is the sum of the two:\n$$\nR_{\\text{SEI}} = R_1 + R_2 = 2.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega \\cdot m^2} + 4.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega \\cdot m^2} = 0.0002 + 0.0040 = 0.0042\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega \\cdot m^2}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the magnitude of the ohmic potential drop across the SEI using the given current density magnitude $|j| = 25\\,\\mathrm{A\\,m^{-2}}$:\n$$\n|\\Delta \\phi_{\\text{SEI}}| = |j| \\cdot R_{\\text{SEI}} = (25\\,\\mathrm{A\\,m^{-2}}) \\cdot (0.0042\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega \\cdot m^2}) = 0.105\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\nThe interfacial charge-transfer overpotential is defined as the portion of the total measured overpotential, $|\\eta_{\\text{tot}}| = 0.160\\,\\mathrm{V}$, not consumed by this ohmic drop:\n$$\n|\\eta_{\\text{ct}}| = |\\eta_{\\text{tot}}| - |\\Delta \\phi_{\\text{SEI}}| = 0.160\\,\\mathrm{V} - 0.105\\,\\mathrm{V} = 0.055\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n|\\eta_{\\text{ct}}| = 0.05500\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\n\n### Part 3: Interpretation\n\nThe total overpotential of $|\\eta_{\\text{tot}}| = 160\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ represents the total electrochemical driving force required to sustain a current density of $25\\,\\mathrm{A\\,m^{-2}}$. Our calculation shows that this total is partitioned into two main contributions: a $105\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ drop due to the ohmic resistance of the SEI, and a $55\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ drop associated with the charge-transfer kinetics at the lithium metal/SEI interface.\n\nThe ohmic drop across the SEI constitutes $\\frac{0.105\\,\\mathrm{V}}{0.160\\,\\mathrm{V}} \\approx 65.6\\%$ of the total overpotential. This demonstrates that the SEI's resistance to ion migration is the dominant source of potential loss under these conditions. A large ohmic drop means a substantial fraction of the applied potential is dissipated as heat within the SEI, rather than driving the desired electrochemical reaction at the interface. This significantly constrains the fraction of the total overpotential available to overcome the activation energy barrier for charge transfer, which is only $34.4\\%$ in this case. For high-performance batteries, especially at high charge/discharge rates, a thick or low-conductivity SEI like the one described would severely limit efficiency and power capability. Therefore, engineering thin, highly conductive SEI layers is a critical goal in advanced battery design.",

We must convert this to Coulombs using the provided conversion factor $1\\,\\mathrm{mAh} = 3.6\\,\\mathrm{C}$.\n$$ \\Delta Q_{loss} = 0.010\\,\\mathrm{mAh} \\cdot \\frac{3.6\\,\\mathrm{C}}{1\\,\\mathrm{mAh}} = 0.036\\,\\mathrm{C} $$\nUsing Faraday's constant $F = 96485\\,\\mathrm{C/mol}$:\n$$ \\Delta n_{Li} = \\frac{0.036\\,\\mathrm{C}}{96485\\,\\mathrm{C/mol}} \\approx 3.73115 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{mol} $$\nTherefore, the moles of $\\mathrm{Li_2CO_3}$ formed are:\n$$ \\Delta n_{\\mathrm{Li_2CO_3}} = \\frac{3.73115 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{mol}}{2} \\approx 1.86558 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{mol} $$\n\nNow we can calculate the volume of SEI formed per cycle, using $M_{\\mathrm{Li_2CO_3}} = 73.89\\,\\mathrm{g/mol}$ and $\\rho_{\\mathrm{Li_2CO_3}} = 2.11\\,\\mathrm{g/cm}^3$.\n$$ \\Delta V_{SEI} = \\frac{(1.86558 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{mol}) \\cdot (73.89\\,\\mathrm{g/mol})}{2.11\\,\\mathrm{g/cm}^3} \\approx 6.5333 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^3 $$\n\nFinally, we calculate the SEI thickness increase per cycle:\n$$ \\Delta \\tau_{SEI} = \\frac{\\Delta V_{SEI}}{A_{total}} = \\frac{6.5333 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^3}{1200\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2} \\approx 5.4444 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{cm} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer in nanometers ($\\mathrm{nm}$). We use the conversion $1\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 10^7\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n$$ \\Delta \\tau_{SEI} = (5.4444 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{cm}) \\cdot (10^7\\,\\mathrm{nm/cm}) = 0.054444\\,\\mathrm{nm} $$\n\nTo combine all steps into a single symbolic expression for clarity:\n$$ \\Delta \\tau_{SEI} = \\frac{\\Delta V_{SEI}}{A_{total}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{\\Delta n_{\\mathrm{Li_2CO_3}} \\cdot M_{\\mathrm{Li_2CO_3}}}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{Li_2CO_3}}} \\right)}{m_{graphite} \\cdot S_{BET}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{(\\Delta Q_{loss}/(2F)) \\cdot M_{\\mathrm{Li_2CO_3}}}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{Li_2CO_3}}} \\right)}{(L_m \\cdot A_{footprint}) \\cdot S_{BET}} $$\n$$ \\Delta \\tau_{SEI} = \\frac{\\Delta Q_{loss} \\cdot M_{\\mathrm{Li_2CO_3}}}{2 \\cdot F \\cdot \\rho_{\\mathrm{Li_2CO_3}} \\cdot L_m \\cdot A_{footprint} \\cdot S_{BET}} $$\nSubstituting all values with consistent units (grams, centimeters, seconds):\n$$ \\Delta \\tau_{SEI} = \\frac{(0.036\\,\\mathrm{C}) \\cdot (73.89\\,\\mathrm{g/mol})}{2 \\cdot (96485\\,\\mathrm{C/mol}) \\cdot (2.11\\,\\mathrm{g/cm}^3) \\cdot (6.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{g/cm}^2) \\cdot (10.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2) \\cdot (2.00 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{g})} $$\n$$ \\Delta \\tau_{SEI} = \\frac{2.66004}{488552400}\\,\\mathrm{cm} \\approx 5.4444 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{cm} $$\nThis confirms the previous step-by-step calculation. Converting units and rounding to four significant figures as requested:\n$$ \\Delta \\tau_{SEI} \\approx 0.05444\\,\\mathrm{nm/cycle} $$",
