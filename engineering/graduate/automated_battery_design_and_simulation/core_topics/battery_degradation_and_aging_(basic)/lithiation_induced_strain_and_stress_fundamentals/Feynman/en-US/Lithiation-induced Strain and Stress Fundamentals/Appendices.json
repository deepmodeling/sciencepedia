A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the volumetric chemical strain, $\\epsilon_{V}^{\\text{chem}}$, as a function of the lithium partial molar volume, $\\Omega$, and the lithium concentration, $c$.\n\nWe begin with the fundamental thermodynamic definition of the partial molar volume of lithium, $\\Omega$:\n$$\n\\Omega = \\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial n_{\\text{Li}}}\\right)_{T,p,n_{\\text{host}}}\n$$\nThis equation describes the differential change in the total volume $V$ of the system with respect to a differential change in the number of moles of lithium $n_{\\text{Li}}$, while holding temperature $T$, pressure $p$, and the amount of host material $n_{\\text{host}}$ constant. The problem specifies an isothermal and isobaric process, which matches these constraints.\n\nThis partial differential relationship can be written as a total differential for the change in volume due to lithiation:\n$$\ndV = \\Omega \\, dn_{\\text{Li}}\n$$\nTo find the total change in volume when the system transitions from its unlithiated reference state ($n_{\\text{Li}} = 0$, $V = V_0$) to a lithiated state ($n_{\\text{Li}}$, $V$), we must integrate this expression. The problem provides a single numerical value for $\\Omega$, which implies that $\\Omega$ is assumed to be constant over the concentration range of interest. This is a common and valid simplification in the small-strain regime, where the properties of the host material do not change significantly with composition.\n\nIntegrating from the initial state to the final state:\n$$\n\\int_{V_0}^{V} dV' = \\int_{0}^{n_{\\text{Li}}} \\Omega \\, dn'_{\\text{Li}}\n$$\nSince $\\Omega$ is treated as a constant, it can be moved outside the integral:\n$$\n\\int_{V_0}^{V} dV' = \\Omega \\int_{0}^{n_{\\text{Li}}} dn'_{\\text{Li}}\n$$\nPerforming the integration yields:\n$$\n[V']_{V_0}^{V} = \\Omega [n'_{\\text{Li}}]_{0}^{n_{\\text{Li}}}\n$$\n$$\nV - V_0 = \\Omega (n_{\\text{Li}} - 0)\n$$\nThus, the total volume change, $\\Delta V = V - V_0$, is given by:\n$$\nV - V_0 = \\Omega \\, n_{\\text{Li}}\n$$\nThe problem defines the volumetric chemical strain as $\\epsilon_{V}^{\\text{chem}} = \\frac{V - V_0}{V_0}$. Substituting our expression for the volume change $V - V_0$:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{V}^{\\text{chem}} = \\frac{\\Omega \\, n_{\\text{Li}}}{V_0}\n$$\nFinally, we use the given definition for the lithium concentration, $c = \\frac{n_{\\text{Li}}}{V_0}$. Substituting this into the equation for strain, we arrive at the desired relationship:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{V}^{\\text{chem}} = \\Omega \\, c\n$$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nWe are asked to compute the value of $\\epsilon_{V}^{\\text{chem}}$ using the derived formula and the provided data:\n- $\\Omega = 3.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}/\\mathrm{mol}$\n- $c = 2.0 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{mol}/\\mathrm{m}^{3}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression $\\epsilon_{V}^{\\text{chem}} = \\Omega \\, c$:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{V}^{\\text{chem}} = (3.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}/\\mathrm{mol}) \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{mol}/\\mathrm{m}^{3})\n$$\nThe units correctly cancel out ($\\frac{\\mathrm{m}^{3}}{\\mathrm{mol}} \\times \\frac{\\mathrm{mol}}{\\mathrm{m}^{3}}$), resulting in a dimensionless quantity, as is proper for strain.\n\nMultiplying the numerical values:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{V}^{\\text{chem}} = (3.0 \\times 2.0) \\times (10^{-6} \\times 10^{4})\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon_{V}^{\\text{chem}} = 6.0 \\times 10^{-2}\n$$\nExpressed as a decimal fraction, this is:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{V}^{\\text{chem}} = 0.060\n$$\nThe input values, $3.0$ and $2.0$, each have two significant figures.

It is a standard problem in chemo-mechanics, a subfield of solid mechanics. The provided information is complete and consistent, leading to a unique and meaningful solution. The problem is not trivial and requires a careful application of $3\\mathrm{D}$ elasticity theory.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe solution proceeds by first determining the state of stress and strain from the boundary conditions and problem symmetry, and then using the constitutive relations to find the unknown stress component.\n\n1.  **Governing Equations**\n\n    The total strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ is the linear superposition of the mechanical (elastic) strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^{\\text{mech}}$ and the chemical eigenstrain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^{\\text{chem}}$:\n    $$ \\epsilon_{ij} = \\epsilon^{\\text{mech}}_{ij} + \\epsilon^{\\text{chem}}_{ij} $$\n    The chemical strain is given as isotropic and uniform:\n    $$ \\epsilon^{\\text{chem}}_{ij} = \\beta c \\delta_{ij} $$\n    where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\n    The mechanical strain is related to the Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ by the constitutive law for an isotropic, linear elastic solid. In component form, this is:\n    $$ \\epsilon^{\\text{mech}}_{ij} = \\frac{1}{E} \\left[ (1+\\nu)\\sigma_{ij} - \\nu \\sigma_{kk} \\delta_{ij} \\right] $$\n    where $\\sigma_{kk} = \\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy} + \\sigma_{zz}$ is the trace of the stress tensor.\n\n2.  **Application of Boundary Conditions and Symmetry**\n\n    -   **Static Boundary Conditions**: The lateral surfaces of the bar are traction-free. For a prismatic bar with uniform loading, we assume a uniform stress state across any cross-section (neglecting end effects, per Saint-Venant's principle). A traction-free surface with its normal in the $y$ or $z$ direction implies that the stress components $\\sigma_{yy}$ and $\\sigma_{zz}$ are zero on those surfaces, and thus throughout the bar.\n    $$ \\sigma_{yy} = 0 $$\n    $$ \\sigma_{zz} = 0 $$\n    Furthermore, with no applied torsional or shear loads, the shear components of stress are also zero:\n    $$ \\sigma_{xy} = \\sigma_{yz} = \\sigma_{zx} = 0 $$\n    Therefore, the stress state is uniaxial, with $\\sigma_{xx}$ being the only potentially non-zero component. The trace of the stress tensor simplifies to $\\sigma_{kk} = \\sigma_{xx}$.\n\n    -   **Kinematic Boundary Conditions**: The bar is fixed at both ends, meaning the axial displacement $u_x$ is zero at $x=0$ and $x=L$.\n    $$ u_x(0) = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad u_x(L) = 0 $$\n    The total elongation of the bar is the integral of the axial strain $\\epsilon_{xx}$ along its length:\n    $$ \\Delta L = \\int_{0}^{L} \\epsilon_{xx} \\, dx = u_x(L) - u_x(0) = 0 - 0 = 0 $$\n    Since the loading (uniform $c$) and geometry (uniform cross-section) are constant along the length $x$, the resulting strain state must also be uniform with respect to $x$. Thus, $\\epsilon_{xx}$ is a constant. For its integral over the length $L$ to be zero, the constant itself must be zero.\n    $$ \\epsilon_{xx} = 0 $$\n\n3.  **Solving for Axial Stress $\\sigma_{xx}$**\n\n    We now combine the kinematic result ($\\epsilon_{xx}=0$) with the strain decomposition and constitutive law.\n\n    First, consider the axial component ($i=j=x$) of the strain decomposition equation:\n    $$ \\epsilon_{xx} = \\epsilon^{\\text{mech}}_{xx} + \\epsilon^{\\text{chem}}_{xx} $$\n    Substituting the known values $\\epsilon_{xx}=0$ and $\\epsilon^{\\text{chem}}_{xx}=\\beta c$:\n    $$ 0 = \\epsilon^{\\text{mech}}_{xx} + \\beta c $$\n    This implies that the mechanical strain must exactly counteract the chemical strain:\n    $$ \\epsilon^{\\text{mech}}_{xx} = -\\beta c $$\n\n    Next, we use the constitutive relation for the axial mechanical strain, $\\epsilon^{\\text{mech}}_{xx}$:\n    $$ \\epsilon^{\\text{mech}}_{xx} = \\frac{1}{E} \\left[ \\sigma_{xx} - \\nu(\\sigma_{yy} + \\sigma_{zz}) \\right] $$\n    Substitute the stress conditions $\\sigma_{yy}=0$ and $\\sigma_{zz}=0$:\n    $$ \\epsilon^{\\text{mech}}_{xx} = \\frac{1}{E} \\left[ \\sigma_{xx} - \\nu(0 + 0) \\right] = \\frac{\\sigma_{xx}}{E} $$\n    This is the expected uniaxial stress-strain relationship.\n\n    Finally, we equate the two expressions derived for $\\epsilon^{\\text{mech}}_{xx}$:\n    $$ \\frac{\\sigma_{xx}}{E} = -\\beta c $$\n    Solving for the axial stress $\\sigma_{xx}$ yields the final result:\n    $$ \\sigma_{xx} = -E \\beta c $$\n\n    The negative sign indicates that for a positive expansion coefficient $\\beta$ and positive concentration $c$ (lithiation), the resulting stress is compressive, as expected from the mechanical constraint preventing axial expansion. The result is independent of Poisson's ratio $\\nu$ because the lateral directions are free to deform, preventing the buildup of lateral stresses that would otherwise couple into the axial direction via the Poisson effect.",

Let's re-verify that.\n$\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(r) = \\frac{EA}{1-2\\nu} + \\frac{E B (1+2\\nu) r}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)} - \\frac{E\\beta c_s r}{(1-2\\nu)R}$.\nWith $A = \\frac{\\beta c_s (1-2\\nu)}{2(1-\\nu)}$ and $B = \\frac{\\beta(1+\\nu)c_s}{4(1-\\nu)R}$.\n$\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(r) = \\frac{E}{1-2\\nu} \\frac{\\beta c_s (1-2\\nu)}{2(1-\\nu)} + \\frac{E}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)}\\frac{\\beta(1+\\nu)c_s}{4(1-\\nu)R}(1+2\\nu)r - \\frac{E\\beta c_s r}{(1-2\\nu)R}$.\n$\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(r) = \\frac{E\\beta c_s}{2(1-\\nu)} + \\frac{E\\beta c_s r}{(1-2\\nu)R} \\left( \\frac{1+2\\nu}{4(1-\\nu)} - 1 \\right)$.\nThe term in the parenthesis is $\\frac{1+2\\nu - 4(1-\\nu)}{4(1-\\nu)} = \\frac{1+2\\nu-4+4\\nu}{4(1-\\nu)} = \\frac{6\\nu-3}{4(1-\\nu)} = -\\frac{3(1-2\\nu)}{4(1-\\nu)}$.\nSo the $r$ term is $\\frac{E\\beta c_s r}{(1-2\\nu)R} \\left( -\\frac{3(1-2\\nu)}{4(1-\\nu)} \\right) = -\\frac{3E\\beta c_s r}{4R(1-\\nu)}$.\nThe hoop stress is: $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(r) = \\frac{E\\beta c_s}{2(1-\\nu)} - \\frac{3E\\beta c_s r}{4R(1-\\nu)} = \\frac{E\\beta c_s}{4(1-\\nu)}\\left(2 - \\frac{3r}{R}\\right)$.\nThis matches my first derivation and differs from the textbook general solution, which I must have misremembered or mis-transcribed. I will trust the step-by-step derivation from the displacement field.\n\nTo find the maximum value of $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(r)$ in the domain $0 \\le r \\le R$, we inspect its dependence on $r$. The expression is a linear function of $r$. Its derivative with respect to $r$ is:\n$\\frac{d\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}}{dr} = -\\frac{3E\\beta c_s}{4R(1-\\nu)}$.\nGiven that $E>0$, $\\beta>0$ (expansion), $c_s>0$, $R>0$, and $0 < \\nu < 1/2$ (so $1-\\nu>0$), the derivative is negative for all $r$. This means $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(r)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $r$.\nThe maximum value of a monotonically decreasing function on a closed interval occurs at the left endpoint. Therefore, the maximum hoop stress occurs at the center of the sphere, $r=0$.\n\nSubstituting $r=0$ into the expression for $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(r)$:\n$\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}^{\\max} = \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(0) = \\frac{E\\beta c_s}{4(1-\\nu)}(2 - 0)$.\n$\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}^{\\max} = \\frac{2E\\beta c_s}{4(1-\\nu)} = \\frac{E\\beta c_s}{2(1-\\nu)}$.\nThis is the maximum value of the hoop stress. It is tensile, which is physically expected at the center, as the outer regions expand more (due to higher concentration) and pull the inner core outward.",
