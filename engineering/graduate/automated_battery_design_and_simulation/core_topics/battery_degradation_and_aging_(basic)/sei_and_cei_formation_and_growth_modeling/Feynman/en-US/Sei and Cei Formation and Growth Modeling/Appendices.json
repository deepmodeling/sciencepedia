            "problem": "In an automated battery design-and-simulation workflow for a lithium-ion cell, the negative electrode is modeled as graphite forming a Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI), and the positive electrode forms a Cathode Electrolyte Interphase (CEI). Under the stated operating and potential conditions, CEI-related parasitic current is negligible compared to SEI. The cell is cycled under a constant-current, constant-duration protocol designed for algorithmic repeatability: charge at current magnitude $I_{\\mathrm{main}}$ for duration $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ch}}$, then discharge at the same current magnitude for duration $\\tau_{\\mathrm{dis}}$, repeated for $N$ cycles. The reversible capacity at the start of life is $Q_0$. The parasitic SEI current follows a diffusion-limited kinetics commonly observed in long-time SEI growth, modeled as $i_{\\mathrm{SEI}}(t) = k\\,(\\,t+t_0\\,)^{-1/2}$, where $t$ is the elapsed time since the start of cycling. Because the SEI reaction is most active when the negative electrode potential is low, it is only active for a fraction $\\alpha$ of the time in each cycle, with $\\alpha$ assumed constant under the fixed protocol.\n\nAt the beginning of life at $t = 0^{+}$ during the charge step, the measured main-reaction current and side-reaction current are $I_{\\mathrm{main}}$ and $i_{\\mathrm{SEI}}(0)$, respectively. Define the instantaneous Coulombic efficiency as $\\mathrm{CE} = I_{\\mathrm{main}}/\\big(I_{\\mathrm{main}} + i_{\\mathrm{SEI}}\\big)$. Using the fundamental definition of Coulombic efficiency and conservation of lithium inventory, derive an expression for the remaining capacity after $N$ cycles, $Q(N)$, in terms of $Q_0$, $k$, $t_0$, $\\alpha$, and the total elapsed time, and then evaluate it numerically under the following scientifically consistent operating conditions:\n- Initial reversible capacity $Q_0 = 3.000$ Ah.\n- Main-reaction current magnitude $I_{\\mathrm{main}} = 1.500$ A on both charge and discharge.\n- Charge and discharge durations $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ch}} = 1.000$ h and $\\tau_{\\mathrm{dis}} = 1.000$ h (held constant by protocol, independent of capacity loss).\n- Number of cycles $N = 1000$.\n- SEI side-reaction kinetic parameter $k = 1.000 \\times 10^{-2}$ A h$^{1/2}$ and time-offset $t_0 = 10.00$ h.\n- SEI duty fraction $\\alpha = 0.500$.\n\nAssume that all parasitic charge consumed by the SEI irreversibly removes cyclable lithium and therefore directly reduces reversible capacity, and that the CEI contribution is negligible under these conditions. Compute the instantaneous Coulombic efficiency at $t=0^{+}$ during the first charge using the given measured currents, then predict the long-term capacity fade under the constant cycling protocol. What is the predicted remaining capacity $Q(N)$ after $N=1000$ cycles? Round your final answer to four significant figures and express it in Ah.",

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe capacity fade of the cell is due to the irreversible loss of cyclable lithium to the formation of the Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI). The remaining reversible capacity after $N$ cycles, $Q(N)$, is the initial capacity, $Q_0$, minus the total charge lost to the SEI parasitic reaction, $Q_{\\mathrm{loss}}$.\n$$Q(N) = Q_0 - Q_{\\mathrm{loss}}(N)$$\nThe total charge lost is the integral of the parasitic current over time. The problem states that the SEI reaction is active for a fraction $\\alpha$ of the time in each cycle and that the instantaneous current follows $i_{\\mathrm{SEI}}(t) = k(t+t_0)^{-1/2}$, where $t$ is the total elapsed time. The most direct and standard interpretation for modeling this is to consider an effective parasitic current, averaged over the full cycle duration, which is $\\alpha \\cdot i_{\\mathrm{SEI}}(t)$. The total charge lost over a total time period $t_f$ is the integral of this effective current.\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{loss}}(t_f) = \\int_0^{t_f} \\alpha \\cdot i_{\\mathrm{SEI}}(t) \\, dt$$\nSubstituting the expression for $i_{\\mathrm{SEI}}(t)$:\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{loss}}(t_f) = \\int_0^{t_f} \\alpha k (t+t_0)^{-1/2} \\, dt$$\nWe can solve this integral analytically.\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{loss}}(t_f) = \\alpha k \\int_0^{t_f} (t+t_0)^{-1/2} \\, dt = \\alpha k \\left[ 2(t+t_0)^{1/2} \\right]_0^{t_f}$$\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{loss}}(t_f) = 2 \\alpha k \\left( (t_f+t_0)^{1/2} - (0+t_0)^{1/2} \\right) = 2 \\alpha k \\left( \\sqrt{t_f+t_0} - \\sqrt{t_0} \\right)$$\nThe total elapsed time after $N$ cycles, $t_N$, is determined by the constant cycle duration, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{cycle}} = \\tau_{\\mathrm{ch}} + \\tau_{\\mathrm{dis}}$.\n$$t_N = N \\cdot \\tau_{\\mathrm{cycle}} = N (\\tau_{\\mathrm{ch}} + \\tau_{\\mathrm{dis}})$$\nSubstituting $t_f = t_N$ into the expression for $Q_{\\mathrm{loss}}$, we obtain the total capacity loss after $N$ cycles.\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{loss}}(N) = 2 \\alpha k \\left( \\sqrt{N (\\tau_{\\mathrm{ch}} + \\tau_{\\mathrm{dis}}) + t_0} - \\sqrt{t_0} \\right)$$\nTherefore, the remaining capacity $Q(N)$ is given by the expression:\n$$Q(N) = Q_0 - 2 \\alpha k \\left( \\sqrt{N (\\tau_{\\mathrm{ch}} + \\tau_{\\mathrm{dis}}) + t_0} - \\sqrt{t_0} \\right)$$\nBefore calculating the long-term capacity, we first compute the instantaneous Coulombic efficiency at the start of cycling, $t=0^{+}$.

This indicates that under the specified conditions, the SEI growth rate during the lithiation of the negative electrode is nearly four times higher than during delithiation. Therefore, SEI growth predominantly occurs on lithiation. This asymmetry arises because both the charge transfer overpotential and the ohmic drop across the SEI contribute to a more negative electrode potential during lithiation, which more strongly drives the parasitic electrolyte reduction reaction responsible for SEI formation.",

            "problem": "You are given three synthetic Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) datasets representing a lithium-ion cell with a Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) layer, modeled by an equivalent circuit. The objective is to fit each dataset to extract the SEI resistance, convert it to SEI thickness via an area-scaled conductivity, and propagate uncertainty from the conductivity to the thickness. Derive and implement the relevant relationships from first principles and produce a single line of output containing the results for the three test cases.\n\nStart from the following fundamental base:\n\n- Ohm's law: $V = I R$.\n- For a homogeneous slab of thickness $\\delta$ conducting ionic current, the resistance is $R = \\rho \\, \\delta / A$, where $\\rho$ is the resistivity and $A$ is the geometric area. Using $\\kappa$ for conductivity, $\\rho = 1/\\kappa$, so $R = \\delta / (\\kappa A)$. Define the area-scaled effective conductivity $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\equiv \\kappa A$ with units of $\\mathrm{S \\cdot m}$ so that the SEI resistance satisfies $R_{\\mathrm{SEI}} = \\delta / \\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, and thus $\\delta = R_{\\mathrm{SEI}} \\, \\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n- The impedance of a capacitor is $Z_C(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{j \\, \\omega \\, C}$, where $j = \\sqrt{-1}$, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency in radians per second, and $C$ is the capacitance.\n- A resistor $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$ in parallel with a capacitor $C_{\\mathrm{dl}}$ has an equivalent impedance\n  $$Z_{\\parallel}(\\omega) = \\left(\\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{ct}}} + j \\, \\omega \\, C_{\\mathrm{dl}}\\right)^{-1} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{ct}}}{1 + j \\, \\omega \\, R_{\\mathrm{ct}} \\, C_{\\mathrm{dl}}}.$$\n- For the simplified SEI-inclusive Randles-type equivalent circuit used here, the total impedance is\n  $$Z(\\omega) = R_{\\mathrm{s}} + R_{\\mathrm{SEI}} + Z_{\\parallel}(\\omega),$$\n  where $R_{\\mathrm{s}}$ is the known series electrolyte/lead resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{SEI}}$ is the SEI resistance to be estimated, $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$ is the charge-transfer resistance, and $C_{\\mathrm{dl}}$ is the double-layer capacitance.\n\nYour program must:\n\n1. For each test case, generate the synthetic \"measured\" impedance data $\\{(\\omega_i, Z_i)\\}$ by evaluating $Z(\\omega)$ at the specified parameters and adding deterministic small complex perturbations to simulate measurement noise. Do not use any randomness; use the exact noise prescription given below.\n2. Fit the parameters $R_{\\mathrm{SEI}}$, $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$, and $C_{\\mathrm{dl}}$ by nonlinear least squares to minimize the sum of squared residuals between the real and imaginary parts of $Z(\\omega)$ and the measured data, while keeping $R_{\\mathrm{s}}$ fixed to its known value. Constrain all fitted parameters to be nonnegative.\n3. Using the fitted $R_{\\mathrm{SEI}}$, compute the SEI thickness mean and standard deviation from the relationship $\\delta = R_{\\mathrm{SEI}} \\, \\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ assuming that uncertainty arises only from $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. If $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ has mean $\\mu_{\\kappa}$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_{\\kappa}$, then the mean thickness is $\\mu_{\\delta} = R_{\\mathrm{SEI}} \\, \\mu_{\\kappa}$ and the standard deviation is $\\sigma_{\\delta} = R_{\\mathrm{SEI}} \\, \\sigma_{\\kappa}$. Express the thickness in meters.\n\nAll physical quantities must be used in consistent units: angular frequency in radians per second, resistance in ohms, capacitance in farads, and $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ in siemens meters ($\\mathrm{S \\cdot m}$). Thickness $\\delta$ must be reported in meters. Angles do not appear in this problem. Report all numerical results as floating-point values without any unit strings.\n\nTest suite specification:\n\nFor each test case, define a set of angular frequencies $\\{\\omega_i\\}$, the known series resistance $R_{\\mathrm{s}}$, the true parameter values used to generate the synthetic measured data, the deterministic noise parameters, and the statistics of $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. The synthetic measured impedance is\n$$Z_i^{\\mathrm{meas}} = Z(\\omega_i; R_{\\mathrm{s}}, R_{\\mathrm{SEI}}^{\\mathrm{true}}, R_{\\mathrm{ct}}^{\\mathrm{true}}, C_{\\mathrm{dl}}^{\\mathrm{true}}) + \\left(\\alpha \\, \\frac{\\omega_i}{\\omega_{\\max}}\\right) + j \\left(\\beta \\, \\left(\\frac{\\omega_i}{\\omega_{\\max}}\\right)^2\\right),$$\nwhere $\\omega_{\\max} = \\max_i \\omega_i$, and $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are real constants with units of ohms controlling the deterministic measurement perturbations.\n\n- Test Case A (general, \"happy path\"):\n  - Frequencies: $\\omega_i = 2 \\pi f_i$ with $f_i \\in \\{10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000\\}$ in hertz.\n  - Known series resistance: $R_{\\mathrm{s}} = 0.5$.\n  - True parameters: $R_{\\mathrm{SEI}}^{\\mathrm{true}} = 3.0$, $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}^{\\mathrm{true}} = 5.0$, $C_{\\mathrm{dl}}^{\\mathrm{true}} = 200 \\times 10^{-6}$.\n  - Noise parameters: $\\alpha = 0.02$, $\\beta = -0.01$.\n  - Conductivity statistics: $\\mu_{\\kappa} = 1.8 \\times 10^{-8}$, $\\sigma_{\\kappa} = 0.3 \\times 10^{-8}$.\n- Test Case B (boundary case: noiseless and very thin SEI):\n  - Frequencies: same as Test Case A.\n  - Known series resistance: $R_{\\mathrm{s}} = 0.2$.\n  - True parameters: $R_{\\mathrm{SEI}}^{\\mathrm{true}} = 0.1$, $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}^{\\mathrm{true}} = 10.0$, $C_{\\mathrm{dl}}^{\\mathrm{true}} = 150 \\times 10^{-6}$.\n  - Noise parameters: $\\alpha = 0.0$, $\\beta = 0.0$.\n  - Conductivity statistics: $\\mu_{\\kappa} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-8}$, $\\sigma_{\\kappa} = 0.1 \\times 10^{-8}$.\n- Test Case C (edge case: fewer points and larger SEI resistance):\n  - Frequencies: $\\omega_i = 2 \\pi f_i$ with $f_i \\in \\{50, 100, 500, 5000\\}$ in hertz.\n  - Known series resistance: $R_{\\mathrm{s}} = 0.8$.\n  - True parameters: $R_{\\mathrm{SEI}}^{\\mathrm{true}} = 15.0$, $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}^{\\mathrm{true}} = 2.0$, $C_{\\mathrm{dl}}^{\\mathrm{true}} = 100 \\times 10^{-6}$.\n  - Noise parameters: $\\alpha = 0.05$, $\\beta = 0.02$.\n  - Conductivity statistics: $\\mu_{\\kappa} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-9}$, $\\sigma_{\\kappa} = 0.2 \\times 10^{-9}$.\n\nAlgorithmic and output requirements:\n\n- Implement a nonlinear least squares fit of $R_{\\mathrm{SEI}}$, $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$, and $C_{\\mathrm{dl}}$ by minimizing the sum of squared residuals between the model and the synthetic measured data, using bounds $R_{\\mathrm{SEI}} \\ge 0$, $R_{\\mathrm{ct}} \\ge 0$, and $C_{\\mathrm{dl}} \\ge 0$. Use the same initial guess $(R_{\\mathrm{SEI}}, R_{\\mathrm{ct}}, C_{\\mathrm{dl}}) = (1.0, 1.0, 1.0 \\times 10^{-4})$ for all test cases.\n- Compute the thickness mean $\\mu_{\\delta}$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_{\\delta}$ in meters using $\\mu_{\\delta} = R_{\\mathrm{SEI}}^{\\mathrm{fit}} \\, \\mu_{\\kappa}$ and $\\sigma_{\\delta} = R_{\\mathrm{SEI}}^{\\mathrm{fit}} \\, \\sigma_{\\kappa}$.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, with each test case yielding a two-element list $[\\mu_{\\delta}, \\sigma_{\\delta}]$ expressed in meters. For example: $[[x_1,y_1],[x_2,y_2],[x_3,y_3]]$.\n\nEnsure scientific realism by maintaining physically plausible parameter values and units throughout. The program must be self-contained and must not read any external input.",
            "solution": "We begin from Ohm's law, $V = I R$, which defines resistance $R$ as the ratio of voltage to current. For a uniform ionic conductor of thickness $\\delta$ and area $A$, the resistance is $R = \\rho \\, \\delta / A$, where $\\rho$ is the resistivity. Using the conductivity $\\kappa$ with $\\rho = 1/\\kappa$, we get $R = \\delta / (\\kappa A)$. To simplify the mapping from resistance to thickness for the Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI), we define the area-scaled effective conductivity as $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\equiv \\kappa A$ with units $\\mathrm{S \\cdot m}$. This gives the SEI resistance-thickness relationship\n$$R_{\\mathrm{SEI}} = \\frac{\\delta}{\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}}}, \\quad \\text{so} \\quad \\delta = R_{\\mathrm{SEI}} \\, \\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}}.$$\n\nElectrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measures the complex impedance $Z(\\omega)$ across frequencies. A common equivalent circuit for a lithium-ion interface includes a series resistance $R_{\\mathrm{s}}$ (electrolyte and leads), an SEI resistance $R_{\\mathrm{SEI}}$, and a parallel combination of a charge-transfer resistance $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$ with a double-layer capacitance $C_{\\mathrm{dl}}$. The impedance of a capacitor is $Z_C(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{j \\, \\omega \\, C}$, and a parallel of $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{dl}}$ yields\n$$Z_{\\parallel}(\\omega) = \\left(\\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{ct}}} + j \\, \\omega \\, C_{\\mathrm{dl}}\\right)^{-1}.$$\nWe can rewrite $Z_{\\parallel}(\\omega)$ into a more convenient form using algebra. Let $a = 1/R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$ and $b = \\omega C_{\\mathrm{dl}}$. Then\n$$Z_{\\parallel}(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{a + j b} = \\frac{a - j b}{a^2 + b^2} = \\frac{1/R_{\\mathrm{ct}}}{(1/R_{\\mathrm{ct}})^2 + (\\omega C_{\\mathrm{dl}})^2} - j \\, \\frac{\\omega C_{\\mathrm{dl}}}{(1/R_{\\mathrm{ct}})^2 + (\\omega C_{\\mathrm{dl}})^2}.$$\nMultiplying numerator and denominator by $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}^2$ gives\n$$Z_{\\parallel}(\\omega) = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{ct}}}{1 + j \\, \\omega \\, R_{\\mathrm{ct}} \\, C_{\\mathrm{dl}}}.$$\nTherefore, the total impedance is\n$$Z(\\omega) = R_{\\mathrm{s}} + R_{\\mathrm{SEI}} + \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{ct}}}{1 + j \\, \\omega \\, R_{\\mathrm{ct}} \\, C_{\\mathrm{dl}}}.$$\n\nFor parameter estimation, we are given $R_{\\mathrm{s}}$ and measured complex impedance values at several angular frequencies $\\omega_i$. The measured data are generated synthetically by evaluating $Z(\\omega)$ at specified \"true\" parameters and adding deterministic small real and imaginary perturbations\n$$Z_i^{\\mathrm{meas}} = Z(\\omega_i; R_{\\mathrm{s}}, R_{\\mathrm{SEI}}^{\\mathrm{true}}, R_{\\mathrm{ct}}^{\\mathrm{true}}, C_{\\mathrm{dl}}^{\\mathrm{true}}) + \\left(\\alpha \\, \\frac{\\omega_i}{\\omega_{\\max}}\\right) + j \\left(\\beta \\, \\left(\\frac{\\omega_i}{\\omega_{\\max}}\\right)^2\\right),$$\nwhere $\\omega_{\\max} = \\max_i \\omega_i$ and $\\alpha$, $\\beta$ are fixed per test case. This construction ensures reproducible data that stress the fitting routine without relying on randomness.\n\nWe fit the parameters $R_{\\mathrm{SEI}}$, $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$, and $C_{\\mathrm{dl}}$ by nonlinear least squares. The residual vector stacks the real and imaginary parts across frequencies:\n$$\\mathbf{r} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\mathrm{Re}(Z(\\omega_1) - Z_1^{\\mathrm{meas}}) \\\\\n\\mathrm{Im}(Z(\\omega_1) - Z_1^{\\mathrm{meas}}) \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n\\mathrm{Re}(Z(\\omega_n) - Z_n^{\\mathrm{meas}}) \\\\\n\\mathrm{Im}(Z(\\omega_n) - Z_n^{\\mathrm{meas}})\n\\end{bmatrix},$$\nand the objective is to minimize $\\|\\mathbf{r}\\|_2^2$ subject to bounds $R_{\\mathrm{SEI}} \\ge 0$, $R_{\\mathrm{ct}} \\ge 0$, $C_{\\mathrm{dl}} \\ge 0$. A common and robust approach is to use the Levenberg–Marquardt–like trust-region method or bound-constrained trust-region reflective algorithms, implemented in numerical libraries. We use a fixed initial guess $(R_{\\mathrm{SEI}}, R_{\\mathrm{ct}}, C_{\\mathrm{dl}}) = (1.0, 1.0, 1.0 \\times 10^{-4})$ and impose nonnegativity via bounds.\n\nOnce the fit produces $\\widehat{R}_{\\mathrm{SEI}}$, we convert to thickness using the area-scaled conductivity. Let $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ be modeled as a random variable with mean $\\mu_{\\kappa}$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_{\\kappa}$, independent of the fitting process. With $\\delta = \\widehat{R}_{\\mathrm{SEI}} \\, \\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and treating $\\widehat{R}_{\\mathrm{SEI}}$ as a deterministic scalar, linear propagation of uncertainty gives\n$$\\mu_{\\delta} = \\widehat{R}_{\\mathrm{SEI}} \\, \\mu_{\\kappa}, \\quad \\sigma_{\\delta} = \\widehat{R}_{\\mathrm{SEI}} \\, \\sigma_{\\kappa}.$$\nNo additional uncertainty sources are propagated here by design of the problem thumbnail, focusing solely on conductivity.\n\nWe apply the above to three test cases:\n\n- Test Case A: $\\omega_i = 2 \\pi f_i$ for $f_i \\in \\{10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000\\}$, $R_{\\mathrm{s}} = 0.5$, $R_{\\mathrm{SEI}}^{\\mathrm{true}} = 3.0$, $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}^{\\mathrm{true}} = 5.0$, $C_{\\mathrm{dl}}^{\\mathrm{true}} = 200 \\times 10^{-6}$, deterministic noise $\\alpha = 0.02$, $\\beta = -0.01$, and $\\mu_{\\kappa} = 1.8 \\times 10^{-8}$, $\\sigma_{\\kappa} = 0.3 \\times 10^{-8}$.\n- Test Case B: same $\\omega_i$ as A, $R_{\\mathrm{s}} = 0.2$, $R_{\\mathrm{SEI}}^{\\mathrm{true}} = 0.1$, $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}^{\\mathrm{true}} = 10.0$, $C_{\\mathrm{dl}}^{\\mathrm{true}} = 150 \\times 10^{-6}$, noise $\\alpha = 0.0$, $\\beta = 0.0$, and $\\mu_{\\kappa} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-8}$, $\\sigma_{\\kappa} = 0.1 \\times 10^{-8}$.\n- Test Case C: $\\omega_i = 2 \\pi f_i$ for $f_i \\in \\{50, 100, 500, 5000\\}$, $R_{\\mathrm{s}} = 0.8$, $R_{\\mathrm{SEI}}^{\\mathrm{true}} = 15.0$, $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}^{\\mathrm{true}} = 2.0$, $C_{\\mathrm{dl}}^{\\mathrm{true}} = 100 \\times 10^{-6}$, deterministic noise $\\alpha = 0.05$, $\\beta = 0.02$, and $\\mu_{\\kappa} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-9}$, $\\sigma_{\\kappa} = 0.2 \\times 10^{-9}$.\n\nThe program generates the synthetic measured data using the stated model and noise prescription, fits the parameters with nonnegativity constraints, and computes $(\\mu_{\\delta}, \\sigma_{\\delta})$ for each case. The final output, in meters, is a single line in the format $[[\\mu_{\\delta}^{(A)}, \\sigma_{\\delta}^{(A)}],[\\mu_{\\delta}^{(B)}, \\sigma_{\\delta}^{(B)}],[\\mu_{\\delta}^{(C)}, \\sigma_{\\delta}^{(C)}]]$, with decimal representations.\n\nScientific realism is maintained by:\n- Using standard Randles-type elements appropriate for lithium-ion interfaces.\n- Constraining parameters to nonnegative values.\n- Using physically plausible magnitudes for resistances, capacitances, and conductivities.\n\nThis procedure directly operationalizes SEI growth modeling by connecting EIS-derived resistance to physical thickness and systematically propagating uncertainties from the material property $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.",
