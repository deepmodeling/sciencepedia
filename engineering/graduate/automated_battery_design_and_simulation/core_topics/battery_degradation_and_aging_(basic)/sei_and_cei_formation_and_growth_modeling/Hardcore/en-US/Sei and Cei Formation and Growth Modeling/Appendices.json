In automated multiphysics battery design workflows, such a layer is homogenized to a continuum with an effective ionic conductivity that depends on microstructure. Consider a statistically isotropic, electrolyte-saturated, steady-state regime with negligible concentration gradients in a binary electrolyte so that Ohm’s law at the pore scale applies.

            "solution": "### Derivation of Effective Ionic Conductivity\nLet $\\mathbf{j}$ and $\\phi$ be the local (microscopic) current density and electric potential within a representative elementary volume (REV) of the porous SEI. At the pore scale, Ohm's law applies:\n$$\n\\mathbf{j}(\\mathbf{r}) = -\\kappa(\\mathbf{r}) \\nabla \\phi(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nwhere $\\kappa(\\mathbf{r})$ is the local ionic conductivity. Since only the electrolyte-filled pore phase conducts and the solid phase is insulating, $\\kappa(\\mathbf{r}) = \\kappa_{0}$ in the pore phase and $\\kappa(\\mathbf{r}) = 0$ in the solid phase.\n\nThe macroscopic current density, $\\langle \\mathbf{j} \\rangle$, is the volume average of the microscopic current density over the REV, denoted by volume $V$:\n$$\n\\langle \\mathbf{j} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{V} \\int_V \\mathbf{j}(\\mathbf{r}) \\, dV\n$$\nAs the solid phase does not conduct ($\\mathbf{j}=\\mathbf{0}$), the integral is non-zero only over the pore volume, $V_p$:\n$$\n\\langle \\mathbf{j} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{V} \\int_{V_p} \\mathbf{j}(\\mathbf{r}) \\, dV = \\frac{V_p}{V} \\left( \\frac{1}{V_p} \\int_{V_p} \\mathbf{j}(\\mathbf{r}) \\, dV \\right)\n$$\nBy definition, the porosity is $\\varepsilon = V_p/V$. The term in the parenthesis is the intrinsic average current density within the pore phase, $\\langle \\mathbf{j} \\rangle_p$. Thus, we have:\n$$\n\\langle \\mathbf{j} \\rangle = \\varepsilon \\langle \\mathbf{j} \\rangle_p\n$$\nNow, we relate the current densities to the potential gradients. For simplicity, consider a one-dimensional transport problem across a layer of thickness $L$ subject to a potential difference $\\Delta\\Phi$. The macroscopic potential gradient is uniform, and its magnitude is $|\\nabla \\Phi| = \\Delta\\Phi/L$. The effective Ohm's law is written in terms of magnitude as $|\\langle\\mathbf{j}\\rangle| = \\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}} |\\nabla \\Phi|$.\n\nThe ions, however, travel through winding paths of average length $L_{\\mathrm{path}}$. The geometric tortuosity $\\tau$ is defined as $\\tau = L_{\\mathrm{path}}/L$. The magnitude of the average microscopic potential gradient along these paths is:\n$$\n|\\langle\\nabla\\phi\\rangle_p| \\approx \\frac{\\Delta\\Phi}{L_{\\mathrm{path}}} = \\frac{\\Delta\\Phi}{\\tau L} = \\frac{1}{\\tau} |\\nabla \\Phi|\n$$\nThe magnitude of the intrinsic average current density in the pores, following Ohm's law, is:\n$$\n|\\langle\\mathbf{j}\\rangle_p| \\approx \\kappa_{0} |\\langle\\nabla\\phi\\rangle_p| = \\kappa_{0} \\frac{1}{\\tau} |\\nabla \\Phi|\n$$\nSubstituting this into the relation $|\\langle\\mathbf{j}\\rangle| = \\varepsilon |\\langle\\mathbf{j}\\rangle_p|$:\n$$\n|\\langle\\mathbf{j}\\rangle| = \\varepsilon \\left( \\frac{\\kappa_{0}}{\\tau} |\\nabla \\Phi| \\right) = \\frac{\\varepsilon \\kappa_{0}}{\\tau} |\\nabla \\Phi|\n$$\nComparing this with the definition of the effective conductivity, $|\\langle\\mathbf{j}\\rangle| = \\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}} |\\nabla \\Phi|$, we identify:\n$$\n\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\tau} \\kappa_{0}\n$$\nThis relationship correctly accounts for the reduction in conductive volume (factor of $\\varepsilon$) and the increased path length for ion transport (factor of $1/\\tau$).\n\n### Reduction to a Power Law in Porosity\nThe problem provides a power-law relationship between tortuosity and porosity, $\\tau = \\varepsilon^{1-\\beta}$, which is consistent with effective-medium theories for isotropic media. Substituting this into our derived expression for $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$\n\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\varepsilon^{1-\\beta}} \\kappa_{0}\n$$\nUsing the rules of exponents ($x^a / x^b = x^{a-b}$):\n$$\n\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\kappa_{0} \\, \\varepsilon^{1 - (1-\\beta)} = \\kappa_{0} \\, \\varepsilon^{1 - 1 + \\beta}\n$$\nThis simplifies to the required power-law form:\n$$\n\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\kappa_{0} \\, \\varepsilon^{\\beta}\n$$\nThis result is a variation of the Bruggeman relation, and it correctly shows that the effective conductivity reduces to a power law in $\\varepsilon$ with an exponent of $\\beta$.\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\nFinally, we evaluate $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ using the given numerical values:\n-   Bulk conductivity: $\\kappa_{0} = 1.25\\,\\mathrm{S}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$\n-   Porosity: $\\varepsilon = 0.08$\n-   Exponent: $\\beta = 1.5$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$\n\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 1.25 \\times (0.08)^{1.5}\n$$\nLet's compute the value of $(0.08)^{1.5}$:\n$$\n(0.08)^{1.5} = (0.08)^1 \\times (0.08)^{0.5} = 0.08 \\times \\sqrt{0.08}\n$$\n$$\n\\sqrt{0.08} = \\sqrt{\\frac{8}{100}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{8}}{10} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{10} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{5} \\approx \\frac{1.41421356}{5} \\approx 0.28284271\n$$\n$$\n(0.08)^{1.5} \\approx 0.08 \\times 0.28284271 \\approx 0.022627417\n$$\nNow, multiply by $\\kappa_{0}$:\n$$\n\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx 1.25 \\times 0.022627417 \\approx 0.02828427\\,\\mathrm{S}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

Exponential Term**\n\nThis term depends on the difference in the SEI reaction overpotential, $\\Delta\\eta_{\\mathrm{SEI}} = \\eta_{\\mathrm{SEI}}^{\\mathrm{lith}} - \\eta_{\\mathrm{SEI}}^{\\mathrm{delith}}$.\nUsing the given relation $\\eta_{\\mathrm{SEI}} = \\eta_{\\mathrm{base}} + \\eta_{\\mathrm{ct}} - \\Delta \\phi_{e}$:\n$$\\Delta\\eta_{\\mathrm{SEI}} = (\\eta_{\\mathrm{base}} + \\eta_{\\mathrm{ct}}^{\\mathrm{lith}} - \\Delta \\phi_{e}^{\\mathrm{lith}}) - (\\eta_{\\mathrm{base}} + \\eta_{\\mathrm{ct}}^{\\mathrm{delith}} - \\Delta \\phi_{e}^{\\mathrm{delith}})$$\n$$\\Delta\\eta_{\\mathrm{SEI}} = (\\eta_{\\mathrm{ct}}^{\\mathrm{lith}} - \\eta_{\\mathrm{ct}}^{\\mathrm{delith}}) - (\\Delta \\phi_{e}^{\\mathrm{lith}} - \\Delta \\phi_{e}^{\\mathrm{delith}})$$\nWe evaluate each difference term.\nThe difference in charge-transfer overpotentials is:\n$$\\eta_{\\mathrm{ct}}^{\\mathrm{lith}} - \\eta_{\\mathrm{ct}}^{\\mathrm{delith}} = (-0.050\\,\\mathrm{V}) - (0.050\\,\\mathrm{V}) = -0.100\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nThe ionic potential drop across the SEI is given by $\\Delta \\phi_{e} = -\\dfrac{i L}{\\kappa_{\\mathrm{SEI}}}$.\nFor lithiation, $i=+|i|$:\n$$\\Delta \\phi_{e}^{\\mathrm{lith}} = -\\frac{|i|L}{\\kappa_{\\mathrm{SEI}}} = -\\frac{(5.0\\,\\mathrm{A\\,m^{-2}})(30 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m})}{1.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{S\\,m^{-1}}} = -0.015\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nFor delithiation, $i=-|i|$:\n$$\\Delta \\phi_{e}^{\\mathrm{delith}} = -\\frac{-|i|L}{\\kappa_{\\mathrm{SEI}}} = \\frac{|i|L}{\\kappa_{\\mathrm{SEI}}} = +0.015\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nThe difference in potential drops is:\n$$\\Delta \\phi_{e}^{\\mathrm{lith}} - \\Delta \\phi_{e}^{\\mathrm{delith}} = (-0.015\\,\\mathrm{V}) - (0.015\\,\\mathrm{V}) = -0.030\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\Delta\\eta_{\\mathrm{SEI}}$:\n$$\\Delta\\eta_{\\mathrm{SEI}} = (-0.100\\,\\mathrm{V}) - (-0.030\\,\\mathrm{V}) = -0.070\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nNow we can compute the argument of the exponential:\n$$\\frac{-\\alpha F \\Delta\\eta_{\\mathrm{SEI}}}{RT} = \\frac{- (0.50) (96485\\,\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}}) (-0.070\\,\\mathrm{V})}{(8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}})(298\\,\\mathrm{K})} = \\frac{3376.975}{2477.572} \\approx 1.3630$$\nThe exponential term is $\\exp(1.3630) \\approx 3.9079$.\n\n**3. Final Ratio and Assessment**\n\nCombining the two parts, the ratio of growth rates is:\n$$\\frac{v_{\\mathrm{SEI}}^{\\mathrm{lith}}}{v_{\\mathrm{SEI}}^{\\mathrm{delith}}} = \\left(\\frac{j_{0}^{\\mathrm{lith}}}{j_{0}^{\\mathrm{delith}}}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{-\\alpha F \\Delta\\eta_{\\mathrm{SEI}}}{RT}\\right) \\approx (0.99896) \\times (3.9079) \\approx 3.9039$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $3.904$.\n\nThe computed ratio is approximately $3.904$, which is significantly greater than $1$. This indicates that under the specified conditions, the SEI growth rate during the lithiation of the negative electrode is nearly four times higher than during delithiation. Therefore, SEI growth predominantly occurs on lithiation. This asymmetry arises because both the charge transfer overpotential and the ohmic drop across the SEI contribute to a more negative electrode potential during lithiation, which more strongly drives the parasitic electrolyte reduction reaction responsible for SEI formation.",
