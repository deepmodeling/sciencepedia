            "problem": "In a continuous slot-die coating line for Lithium-ion (Li-ion) cathode fabrication, a slurry comprising active material particles, polymer binder, and organic solvent is metered to achieve a target wet film thickness. Accurate slurry density is required to convert volumetric flow rate to mass flow and to predict hydrodynamic pressure in the die. Consider a well-dispersed ternary slurry with mass fractions $w_{\\text{active}}$, $w_{\\text{binder}}$, and $w_{\\text{solvent}}$ that sum to $1$, and component densities $\\rho_{\\text{active}}$, $\\rho_{\\text{binder}}$, and $\\rho_{\\text{solvent}}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution.\n\nThe task is to derive an expression for the density of a ternary slurry, $\\rho_{\\text{slurry}}$, and then to calculate its value for a specific composition. The derivation will be based on fundamental principles of mass conservation and the assumption of ideal volumetric additivity.\n\nLet $M_{\\text{slurry}}$ and $V_{\\text{slurry}}$ be the total mass and total volume of a sample of the slurry, respectively. The density of the slurry is defined as the ratio of its mass to its volume:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\text{slurry}} = \\frac{M_{\\text{slurry}}}{V_{\\text{slurry}}}\n$$\nThe specific volume, $v_{\\text{slurry}}$, is the reciprocal of the density:\n$$\nv_{\\text{slurry}} = \\frac{1}{\\rho_{\\text{slurry}}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{slurry}}}{M_{\\text{slurry}}}\n$$\nThe slurry is a mixture of three components: active material, binder, and solvent. Let the subscripts 'active', 'binder', and 'solvent' denote the respective components.\n\nAccording to the principle of conservation of mass, the total mass of the slurry is the sum of the masses of its individual components:\n$$\nM_{\\text{slurry}} = M_{\\text{active}} + M_{\\text{binder}} + M_{\\text{solvent}}\n$$\nThe mass fraction, $w_i$, of a component $i$ is defined as the ratio of the mass of that component, $M_i$, to the total mass of the mixture, $M_{\\text{slurry}}$:\n$$\nw_i = \\frac{M_i}{M_{\\text{slurry}}}\n$$\nTherefore, the mass of each component can be expressed as $M_i = w_i M_{\\text{slurry}}$.\n\nThe problem states to assume ideal volumetric additivity. This means that the total volume of the mixture is the sum of the volumes of its individual components. This is a direct consequence of assuming no excess volume of mixing ($V^{\\text{E}} = 0$) and no entrained gas.\n$$\nV_{\\text{slurry}} = V_{\\text{active}} + V_{\\text{binder}} + V_{\\text{solvent}}\n$$\nThe volume of each component, $V_i$, can be expressed in terms of its mass, $M_i$, and density, $\\rho_i$, as $V_i = M_i / \\rho_i$.
