## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

Having established the fundamental principles and mechanisms of constructing physics-informed neural surrogates for Pseudo-Two-Dimensional (P2D) models, we now turn to their application. The true value of this framework lies not merely in creating faster approximations of complex simulations, but in enabling new scientific and engineering workflows that would be computationally prohibitive or conceptually intractable with traditional methods alone. This chapter explores a range of such applications, demonstrating how these surrogates serve as powerful tools for [parameter estimation](@entry_id:139349), design optimization, lifetime prediction, uncertainty quantification, and advanced control. We will see that by embedding physical laws into the structure of machine learning models, we forge a potent link between electrochemistry, materials science, control theory, statistics, and other engineering disciplines.

### Parameter Estimation and Model Calibration

A primary challenge in battery modeling is the determination of the numerous physical parameters within the P2D framework, many of which are difficult or impossible to measure directly. Physics-informed surrogates offer a powerful paradigm for parameter estimation by inverting experimental data. Instead of being fixed constants, physical parameters such as diffusion coefficients, [reaction rate constants](@entry_id:187887), or transport properties can be defined as trainable variables within the learning framework. The optimization process, driven by a composite loss function, then simultaneously adjusts the neural network weights to approximate the system's state and tunes the physical parameters to best align the model's predictions with measurement data.

A typical loss function for this task comprises three essential components: a data-fidelity term, a physics-residual term, and a parameter-prior term. For instance, in estimating a kinetic parameter $k$ from experimental data, the optimization objective would penalize deviations from observed data, enforce compliance with the underlying physical laws (e.g., the Butler-Volmer equation), and regularize the parameter value based on prior knowledge. The gradient of this total loss with respect to the parameter $k$ provides the direction for its update via [gradient descent](@entry_id:145942). The inclusion of a prior, often in the form of a Bayesian prior like a Gaussian distribution, is crucial. This regularization term helps to constrain the parameter search to physically plausible ranges and, critically, improves the [identifiability](@entry_id:194150) of parameters, preventing the optimization from converging to non-physical solutions, especially when the available data provides only weak constraints on certain parameters .

### Accelerating Design and Optimization

The computational cost of high-fidelity P2D simulations is a major bottleneck in battery design, where vast design spaces must be explored. Physics-informed surrogates, once trained, can provide predictions orders of magnitude faster than conventional solvers. More importantly, because they are typically constructed from differentiable components, they provide analytical gradients of performance metrics with respect to design parameters at virtually no extra cost via automatic differentiation. This capability unlocks powerful gradient-based optimization and sensitivity analysis workflows.

#### Sensitivity Analysis for Material and Structural Design

In battery engineering, a key objective is to understand how microstructural properties of the electrodes—such as porosity, tortuosity, and particle size—impact cell-level performance metrics like power capability and energy efficiency. Surrogates that embed [constitutive relations](@entry_id:186508), such as the Bruggeman relation for effective [ionic conductivity](@entry_id:156401), can be used to perform rapid sensitivity analyses. For example, by differentiating the surrogate's prediction of ohmic potential drop with respect to the Bruggeman tortuosity exponent, an engineer can quantify how sensitive the cell's internal resistance is to the tortuosity of the electrode's porous structure. This information is invaluable for guiding the development of new electrode materials and manufacturing processes, as it pinpoints which physical attributes offer the most leverage for performance improvement .

#### Optimal Experimental Design

Physics-informed surrogates can not only learn from data but also guide the acquisition of new, more informative data. This concept, known as Optimal Experimental Design (OED), aims to answer the question: "What experiment should I run next to learn the most about my system?" The sensitivities of observable outputs (like voltage) with respect to uncertain model parameters, which are readily available from the surrogate, are the key ingredient. These sensitivities form the Jacobian of the model, which can be used to compute the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). The FIM quantifies the amount of information a given experiment provides about the unknown parameters.

By evaluating the FIM for a set of candidate experimental protocols—for instance, different current profiles—one can select the protocol that maximizes an information-theoretic criterion (e.g., the determinant of the FIM, known as D-optimality). This [active learning](@entry_id:157812) loop, where the surrogate model is used to design maximally informative experiments that, in turn, generate data to refine the surrogate and its embedded parameters, represents a highly efficient cycle of discovery and model improvement .

#### Reinforcement Learning for Control Protocols

Finding optimal strategies for operating a battery, such as fast-charging protocols that minimize time without inducing degradation, is a complex control problem. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful framework for discovering such strategies. However, RL algorithms require a simulated environment in which to "practice" and learn, and this environment presents a classic dilemma. A full P2D model is too computationally expensive for the thousands of rollouts required in RL training. Conversely, a simple Equivalent Circuit Model (ECM) is fast but lacks the physical fidelity to predict critical degradation phenomena like lithium plating, which is driven by local interfacial potentials and electrolyte concentrations that ECMs do not resolve.

The physics-informed surrogate provides an [ideal solution](@entry_id:147504), serving as a computationally efficient yet physically realistic environment for the RL agent. By accurately capturing the essential nonlinearities of the P2D model—including [electrolyte transport](@entry_id:1124302), [solid-state diffusion](@entry_id:161559), and Butler-Volmer kinetics—the surrogate can predict plating risk and voltage constraints with sufficient fidelity to allow the RL agent to learn a safe and effective charging policy. This application positions the surrogate as a key enabler for deploying advanced, [model-based control](@entry_id:276825) strategies in real-world [battery management systems](@entry_id:1121418) .

### Lifetime Prediction and Health Management

Beyond performance, predicting the degradation and lifetime of a battery is of paramount importance. The physics-informed surrogate framework is naturally extensible to include the governing equations of common aging mechanisms.

By incorporating differential equations that describe phenomena like the growth of the Solid-Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) layer into the physics-informed loss function, the surrogate can learn to predict [capacity fade](@entry_id:1122046) and resistance increase over time. The model can capture how the SEI layer's thickness evolves and how its growing ionic resistance impacts the effective overpotential seen by the [charge-transfer](@entry_id:155270) reaction, thereby degrading cell performance .

Furthermore, to ensure that these aging predictions are physically plausible, one can enforce known mechanistic priors directly into the neural network architecture. For example, it is known that SEI growth rates increase monotonically with temperature and are dependent on the electrode's state of charge (as a proxy for potential). These monotonic relationships can be built into the surrogate by constraining the signs of certain weights and using non-decreasing [activation functions](@entry_id:141784). This use of architectural inductive biases ensures that the model respects fundamental thermodynamics and kinetics, leading to more robust and generalizable predictions of [battery health](@entry_id:267183) and lifetime .

### Uncertainty Quantification and Model Diagnostics

For engineering applications where safety and reliability are critical, a deterministic prediction is insufficient. One must also quantify the uncertainty in that prediction. Physics-informed surrogates can be extended into a probabilistic framework to provide this crucial information.

#### Probabilistic Surrogates and Bayesian Inference

By adopting a Bayesian perspective, we can place prior distributions on the neural network weights and on the unknown physical parameters. The data-fidelity and physics-residual terms of the loss function are re-interpreted as likelihoods. Bayes' rule is then used to combine these likelihoods with the priors to obtain a posterior distribution over all model parameters. This formulation, known as a Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Network (Bayesian PINN), yields not just a single predicted value for voltage or concentration, but a full probability distribution. From this posterior, one can derive [credible intervals](@entry_id:176433), providing a principled measure of confidence in the model's predictions .

#### Propagation of Input Uncertainty

Another crucial UQ task is understanding how uncertainty in the model's inputs propagates to its outputs. For example, if the applied current profile is subject to random fluctuations, what is the resulting uncertainty in the final state of charge or polarization voltage? A physics-informed operator surrogate provides a direct mapping from the input function (the current profile) to the output scalars or functions. If the input uncertainty can be characterized (e.g., as a Gaussian process), this mapping can be used to compute the statistics (mean and variance) of the outputs, providing a clear picture of how operational variability affects performance .

#### Model Validation and Interpretability

The trustworthiness of a surrogate model hinges on a rigorous validation protocol. For [physics-informed models](@entry_id:753434), this protocol must extend beyond simply comparing the surrogate's output to data. A comprehensive validation should include metrics for:
1.  **Behavioral Fidelity**: Low error (e.g., Root Mean Square Error) between the surrogate's observable outputs (like terminal voltage) and reference data from experiments or high-fidelity simulations.
2.  **Global Conservation**: Verification that the surrogate's predictions satisfy [integral conservation laws](@entry_id:202878), such as conservation of total lithium inventory and conservation of charge at the system boundaries.
3.  **Local Physics Compliance**: Small norms for the PDE residuals across the entire spatio-temporal domain, confirming that the surrogate solution adheres to the governing physical laws locally.

Only a model that performs well across all three categories can be accepted for use in critical design and control applications . This layered validation also enhances interpretability. When a surrogate fails, the internal fields it predicts can be inspected to diagnose the source of the error. For example, one can decompose the total voltage error into distinct physical contributions—ohmic, kinetic, and [concentration polarization](@entry_id:266906)—to identify which aspect of the physics the surrogate is struggling to capture, guiding further [model refinement](@entry_id:163834) . This ability to "look inside" the model is a distinct advantage over purely data-driven, black-box approaches and is a central theme when situating these methods within the broader landscape of [model order reduction](@entry_id:167302) .

### Interdisciplinary Connections: Beyond Batteries

The methodology of embedding physical laws described by differential equations into neural network surrogates is not limited to [battery modeling](@entry_id:746700). It represents a general computational paradigm applicable across numerous scientific and engineering fields. A powerful example of this interdisciplinary transfer can be found in semiconductor manufacturing.

The process of Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP), which is used to flatten silicon wafers, is governed by physical laws that can be modeled with partial differential equations. Preston's law, for instance, relates the material removal rate to local pressure and velocity. Similar to the battery problem, engineers seek to optimize the process and the layout design (e.g., the local density of features on the wafer) to achieve a desired outcome, in this case, a uniformly flat surface. A physics-informed surrogate can be constructed to model the evolution of the wafer's surface topography under the CMP process. This surrogate can then be used in an optimization loop for generative process–layout co-synthesis, finding the optimal [pattern density](@entry_id:1129445) that minimizes final thickness non-uniformity. This application mirrors the battery design workflow, demonstrating the unifying power of the physics-informed surrogate framework to accelerate simulation and enable design optimization in disparate physical systems .

### Conclusion

And by embracing probabilistic formulations, they deliver not just predictions but also a principled quantification of uncertainty. These capabilities, demonstrated here in the context of battery science, highlight a generalizable and powerful approach to modeling complex physical systems across a multitude of disciplines.
