            "problem": "Consider a Solid-State Battery (SSB) interface modeled as a mechanically patterned contact between two nominally flat, semi-infinite, homogeneous, isotropic ionic conductors of bulk ionic conductivity $\\kappa$. Assume steady-state, isothermal, linear transport, and negligible electrode kinetics so that the dominant resistance arises from geometric constriction (spreading) of ionic current lines at microcontacts. Let a single circular microcontact of radius $a$ connect the two half-spaces. The governing relations are the local form of Ohm’s law for ionic conduction, $\\mathbf{J}=-\\kappa\\nabla\\phi$, and the continuity equation, $\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{J}=0$, which together imply the Laplace equation $\\nabla^{2}\\phi=0$ in each half-space. Treat the interface plane at $z=0$ with cylindrical coordinates $(r,\\theta,z)$ and impose axisymmetry. Far from the contact, the potentials in the two half-spaces approach constant values differing by an applied potential drop $\\Delta\\phi$, and the interface outside the circular contact region is insulating with zero normal flux.\n\nStarting from these fundamentals and appropriate boundary conditions, derive a closed-form expression for the total constriction resistance $R_{c}$ of the single circular microcontact in terms of $\\kappa$ and $a$. Then, consider an interface containing many, non-overlapping circular microcontacts with radii $\\{a_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{N}$ such that the microcontacts do not hydrodynamically or electrostatically interact (i.e., the superposed fields do not significantly perturb each other). If a chemo-mechanical process removes a fraction $1-f$ of microcontacts from conduction (with $f\\in(0,1]$ the active fraction), and if the set of radii of the remaining active contacts has mean $\\bar{a}$, show how the many-contact interface behaves as a parallel network of constriction resistances. Finally, consider a full cell in which the ionic conduction must pass through two such interfaces in series, indexed by $k\\in\\{1,2\\}$, with bulk ionic conductivities $\\kappa_{k}$, planar areas $A_{k}$, number densities of geometric microcontacts $n_{k}$, active fractions $f_{k}$, and active-contact mean radii $\\bar{a}_{k}$. Under the stated assumptions, provide a single closed-form symbolic expression for the total series contact resistance $R_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ across both interfaces in terms of $\\kappa_{k}$, $A_{k}$, $n_{k}$, $f_{k}$, and $\\bar{a}_{k}$.\n\nExpress your final result symbolically. If interpreted numerically, report resistance in Ohms (SI units).",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It consists of three parts: deriving the constriction resistance for a single circular microcontact, extending this to a non-interacting array of microcontacts, and finally combining two such interfaces in series.\n\nPart 1: Constriction Resistance of a Single Circular Microcontact\n\nWe begin by considering a single circular microcontact of radius $a$ at the interface $z=0$ between two semi-infinite ionic conductors. The problem can be solved by calculating the resistance of one half-space and then, by symmetry, doubling it for the total resistance.\n\nLet's analyze the upper half-space ($z \\ge 0$). We model this as a circular electrode of radius $a$ on the surface of a semi-infinite medium with conductivity $\\kappa$. If the electrode is held at a potential $\\phi_0$ relative to a ground at infinity, the setup is governed by the Laplace equation $\\nabla^2\\phi=0$ with the mixed boundary conditions on the $z=0$ plane:\n1.  $\\phi(r, z=0) = \\phi_0$ for $r \\le a$ (equipotential contact).\n2.  The normal current is zero on the insulator: $J_z = -\\kappa \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial z} = 0$ for $r > a$ (insulating boundary).\n\nThis is a classic problem in potential theory. The total current $I_{1/2}$ flowing from the electrode into the half-space is given by the well-known result:\n$$ I_{1/2} = 4 \\kappa a \\phi_0 $$\nThe resistance of this single half-space, known as the Maxwell spreading resistance, is the ratio of the potential drop to the current:\n$$ R_{1/2} = \\frac{\\phi_0}{I_{1/2}} = \\frac{\\phi_0}{4 \\kappa a \\phi_0} = \\frac{1}{4\\kappa a} $$\nThe total constriction resistance $R_c$ for the contact between the two identical semi-infinite bodies is the sum of the resistances of the two half-spaces connected in series.\n$$ R_c = R_{\\text{upper}} + R_{\\text{lower}} = \\frac{1}{4\\kappa a} + \\frac{1}{4\\kappa a} = \\frac{1}{2\\kappa a} $$\n\nPart 2: Resistance of a Many-Contact Interface\n\nThe problem states that the interface contains many non-overlapping microcontacts that do not interact electrostatically. This means that each microcontact provides an independent, parallel pathway for ion conduction. For a set of parallel resistors, the total conductance is the sum of the individual conductances. The total resistance $R_{\\text{interface}}$ is the reciprocal of the total conductance.\nLet the set of active microcontacts have radii $\\{a_i\\}$. The resistance of a single contact $i$ is $R_i = \\frac{1}{2\\kappa a_i}$. Its conductance is $G_i = 1/R_i = 2\\kappa a_i$.\nThe total conductance of the interface is $G_{\\text{interface}} = \\sum_i G_i = \\sum_i 2\\kappa a_i = 2\\kappa \\sum_i a_i$.\nThe total resistance of the interface is therefore:\n$$ R_{\\text{interface}} = \\frac{1}{G_{\\text{interface}}} = \\frac{1}{2\\kappa \\sum_i a_i} $$\nThe problem specifies that for an interface $k$, there is a planar area $A_k$ with a number density of geometric microcontacts $n_k$. The total number of geometric contacts is $N_{g,k} = n_k A_k$. A fraction $f_k$ of these contacts are active. So, the number of active contacts is $N_{\\text{active},k} = f_k N_{g,k} = f_k n_k A_k$.\nThe mean radius of these active contacts is $\\bar{a}_k$. By definition of the mean, the sum of the radii of the active contacts is $\\sum_{i \\in \\text{active}} a_i = N_{\\text{active},k} \\bar{a}_k$.\nSubstituting these quantities into the expression for the interface resistance $R_k$:\n$$ R_k = \\frac{1}{2\\kappa_k (N_{\\text{active},k} \\bar{a}_k)} = \\frac{1}{2\\kappa_k (f_k n_k A_k) \\bar{a}_k} $$\n\nPart 3: Total Series Resistance of Two Interfaces\n\nThe full cell consists of two such interfaces, indexed by $k \\in \\{1, 2\\}$, connected in series. The total resistance of components in series is the sum of their individual resistances.\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{tot}} = R_1 + R_2 $$\nUsing the expression for the resistance of a single interface derived in Part 2 for each of the two interfaces:\n$$ R_1 = \\frac{1}{2\\kappa_1 f_1 n_1 A_1 \\bar{a}_1} $$\n$$ R_2 = \\frac{1}{2\\kappa_2 f_2 n_2 A_2 \\bar{a}_2} $$\nThe total series contact resistance across both interfaces is the sum of these two terms.\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\frac{1}{2\\kappa_1 f_1 n_1 A_1 \\bar{a}_1} + \\frac{1}{2\\kappa_2 f_2 n_2 A_2 \\bar{a}_2} $$\nThis expression represents the final closed-form symbolic result for the total resistance in terms of all the given parameters.",

            "introduction": "In solid-state batteries, the integrity of interfaces is not static; the very process of charging and discharging can generate mechanical stresses that threaten to pull the interface apart. This practice guides you to build a one-dimensional model that captures the competition between an externally applied stack pressure, which holds the interface together, and the internal tensile stress generated by lithium stripping. By implementing this model, you will gain hands-on experience in multiphysics coupling, linking electrochemistry to mechanics to predict a critical failure mode—interfacial decohesion .",

            "problem": "You are tasked with constructing and analyzing a one-dimensional mechanical-chemical model of contact loss at a solid-solid interface in a Solid-State Battery (SSB). The interface is between a Solid-State Electrolyte (SSE) and a lithium metal anode. External stack pressure is applied normal to the interface, while interfacial electrochemical reactions under a prescribed current density generate a volumetric eigenstrain that can produce tensile stress at the interface. The goal is to determine, for given parameter sets, whether the interface remains in contact or separates. You must implement a complete, runnable program that, for the provided test suite, outputs the contact state and a critical external pressure in a specified format.\n\nModeling assumptions and sign conventions must be as follows:\n- External stack pressure is taken as compressive when positive. Let the externally applied pressure be $P_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ in $\\mathrm{Pa}$.\n- Current density $j$ in $\\mathrm{A/m^2}$ is positive for net stripping (lithium removal) at the interface, and negative for net plating (lithium deposition).\n- The electrochemical molar flux is $J = j / F$, where $F$ is the Faraday constant in $\\mathrm{C/mol}$.\n- A thin interfacial reaction-affected layer of thickness $h$ in $\\mathrm{m}$ develops a volumetric eigenstrain due to mass removal or addition. In a one-dimensional approximation, mass conservation combined with Faraday’s law implies an eigenstrain rate proportional to the flux divergence, which is approximated by $J / h$ over the affected layer. Over a time $t$ in $\\mathrm{s}$, the accumulated volumetric eigenstrain is proportional to $J t / h$ with proportionality factor given by the partial molar volume $\\Omega$ in $\\mathrm{m^3/mol}$. Use the sign convention that stripping ($j > 0$) induces a negative eigenstrain (shrinkage) in the reaction layer adjacent to the interface, and plating ($j < 0$) induces a positive eigenstrain (expansion).\n- The layer behaves as a linearly elastic solid with Young’s modulus $E$ in $\\mathrm{Pa}$. Tensile chemical stress at the interface arises when negative eigenstrain is mechanically opposed. A physically motivated cap $\\sigma_{y}$ in $\\mathrm{Pa}$ represents the maximum attainable tensile chemical stress due to inelastic mechanisms (e.g., microcracking or viscoplastic relaxation), beyond which the stress does not increase.\n\nContact criteria:\n- Let the tensile chemical stress magnitude generated by the eigenstrain be denoted by $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{chem}}$ in $\\mathrm{Pa}$, bounded above by $\\sigma_{y}$. The net normal traction at the interface is then $T_{n} = P_{\\mathrm{ext}} - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{chem}}$. The interface remains in contact if $T_{n} \\ge 0$ and separates otherwise.\n- Define the critical external pressure required to just maintain contact as $P_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{chem}}$. You must output $P_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ in $\\mathrm{Pa}$ for each test case, along with the corresponding boolean contact decision.\n\nFundamental bases to use in your derivation and algorithm design:\n- Faraday’s law linking current density and molar flux: $J = j / F$.\n- Linear elasticity through Hooke’s law in one dimension relating stress to mechanical strain opposing eigenstrain.\n- Mass conservation within the reaction-affected layer linking flux divergence to eigenstrain accumulation via the partial molar volume.\n\nRequired outputs for each test case:\n- A boolean indicating contact (use the literal values True or False) evaluated via $T_{n} \\ge 0$.\n- The critical external pressure $P_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ in $\\mathrm{Pa}$ as a floating-point value.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each test case contributes a two-element list of the form $[ \\text{boolean}, \\text{float} ]$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of continuum mechanics and electrochemistry, including Faraday's law and linear elasticity. The model, while simplified to one dimension, is a plausible representation of chemo-mechanical coupling at a solid-solid interface in a battery. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters, constants, and unambiguous definitions for a unique solution to be calculated. The language is objective and precise, and the given numerical values are physically reasonable. No contradictions, ambiguities, or logical flaws are present.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first deriving the analytical expression for the tensile chemical stress, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{chem}}$, which is then used to determine the contact state and the critical pressure, $P_{\\mathrm{crit}}$.\n\nFirst, we determine the molar flux, $J$, of lithium at the interface. According to Faraday's law, this is directly proportional to the current density, $j$, and inversely proportional to the Faraday constant, $F = 96485.33212 \\, \\mathrm{C/mol}$.\n$$J = \\frac{j}{F}$$\nThe sign convention is that $j > 0$ corresponds to stripping (lithium removal), and $j < 0$ corresponds to plating (lithium deposition).\n\nNext, we calculate the accumulated volumetric eigenstrain, $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{v}}^{\\star}$, in the reaction-affected layer of thickness $h$ over a time $t$. This eigenstrain results from the addition or removal of mass. The rate of volumetric change is proportional to the molar flux, $J$, and the partial molar volume of lithium, $\\Omega$. Over the thickness $h$, the rate of eigenstrain accumulation is approximated as a function of the flux divergence, $J/h$. The accumulated volumetric eigenstrain is therefore given by:\n$$\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{v}}^{\\star} = \\frac{\\Omega J t}{h}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $J$:\n$$\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{v}}^{\\star} = \\frac{\\Omega j t}{F h}$$\nThe problem specifies that stripping ($j>0$) induces a negative eigenstrain (shrinkage). Therefore, we must introduce a negative sign to align with this convention. In a one-dimensional model, it is assumed that this volumetric change is primarily expressed as a strain, $\\epsilon^{\\star}$, normal to the interface.\n$$\\epsilon^{\\star} = - \\frac{\\Omega j t}{F h}$$\n\nThis eigenstrain, $\\epsilon^{\\star}$, represents the strain the material would experience if unconstrained. However, the surrounding material mechanically opposes this strain, inducing an equal and opposite mechanical strain, $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{mech}}$, to maintain compatibility (assuming rigid constraints).\n$$\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{mech}} = - \\epsilon^{\\star} = \\frac{\\Omega j t}{F h}$$\n\nThis mechanical strain generates a stress, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{raw}}$, within the layer, as described by Hooke's Law in one dimension, where $E$ is the Young's modulus.\n$$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{raw}} = E \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{mech}} = E \\left(\\frac{\\Omega j t}{F h}\\right)$$\nIf $j > 0$ (stripping), $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{raw}}$ is positive, indicating a tensile stress. If $j \\le 0$ (plating or zero current), $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{raw}}$ is non-positive, indicating a compressive or zero stress. The problem defines $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{chem}}$ as the magnitude of the *tensile* chemical stress that tends to cause separation. Therefore, any compressive stress from plating does not contribute to decohesion and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{chem}}$ should be zero in such cases. We can express this by taking the maximum of $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{raw}}$ and $0$.\n$$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{chem, uncapped}} = \\max\\left(0, E \\frac{\\Omega j t}{F h}\\right)$$\n\nThe problem further states that this tensile chemical stress is capped by a maximum value, $\\sigma_{y}$, due to inelastic mechanisms. This leads to the final expression for the effective tensile chemical stress, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{chem}}$:\n$$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{chem}} = \\min(\\sigma_{\\mathrm{chem, uncapped}}, \\sigma_{y}) = \\min\\left( \\max\\left(0, E \\frac{\\Omega j t}{F h}\\right), \\sigma_{y} \\right)$$\n\nThe critical external pressure, $P_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, is defined as the pressure required to just maintain contact. This occurs when the external pressure exactly balances the tensile chemical stress.\n$$P_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{chem}}$$\n\nFinally, the contact criterion is evaluated. The net normal traction at the interface, $T_{n}$, is the difference between the externally applied compressive pressure, $P_{\\mathrm{ext}}$, and the tensile chemical stress, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{chem}}$.\n$$T_{n} = P_{\\mathrm{ext}} - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{chem}}$$\nThe interface remains in contact if this net traction is non-negative ($T_{n} \\ge 0$), and separates otherwise ($T_{n} < 0$). The contact status is therefore a boolean value evaluated from the condition $P_{\\mathrm{ext}} \\ge \\sigma_{\\mathrm{chem}}$.\n\nThe algorithm for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Given the parameters $E$, $h$, $\\Omega$, $j$, $t$, $P_{\\mathrm{ext}}$, and $\\sigma_{y}$.\n2.  Calculate the uncapped tensile chemical stress: $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{chem, uncapped}} = \\max\\left(0, E \\frac{\\Omega j t}{F h}\\right)$.\n3.  Apply the yield cap to find the final tensile chemical stress and critical pressure: $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{chem}} = P_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\min(\\sigma_{\\mathrm{chem, uncapped}}, \\sigma_{y})$.\n4.  Determine the contact state by evaluating the boolean expression $P_{\\mathrm{ext}} \\ge \\sigma_{\\mathrm{chem}}$.\n5.  Return the pair $[\\text{contact state}, P_{\\mathrm{crit}}]$.",

This implies that the sum of their probabilities is at most $1$:\n$$P(\\mathcal{H}_{occ}(f)) + P(\\mathcal{V}_{vac}(f)) \\leq 1$$\nA deeper result of percolation theory, established by Russo, Seymour, and Welsh (RSW theory), states that in the limit of an infinitely large domain ($D \\to L$), it is almost sure that one of these two crossings must occur. Thus, the inequality becomes an equality in the thermodynamic limit:\n$$P(\\mathcal{H}_{occ}(f)) + P(\\mathcal{V}_{vac}(f)) = 1$$\nLet us formally define the crossing probability. Let $\\pi_H(f, D)$ be the probability of a horizontal (Left-to-Right) crossing by occupied sites for a given probability $f$ and domain $D$. Similarly, let $\\pi_V(f, D)$ be the probability of a vertical (Top-to-Bottom) crossing by occupied sites.\nThe probability of the event $\\mathcal{H}_{occ}(f)$ is thus $P(\\mathcal{H}_{occ}(f)) = \\pi_H(f, D)$.\n\nThe event $\\mathcal{V}_{vac}(f)$ involves a crossing of vacant sites. The probability of any individual site being vacant is $1-f$. Therefore, the problem of finding a vacant path is identical to the problem of finding an occupied path if the occupation probability were $1-f$. So, the probability of the event $\\mathcal{V}_{vac}(f)$ is equal to the probability of a vertical crossing of occupied sites with an occupation probability of $1-f$:\n$$P(\\mathcal{V}_{vac}(f)) = \\pi_V(1-f, D)$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the equality from RSW theory, we obtain a general relation valid for any planar lattice:\n$$\\pi_H(f, D) + \\pi_V(1-f, D) = 1$$\nNow, we must invoke the specific properties of the triangular lattice. The regular triangular lattice possesses 6-fold rotational symmetry. Due to this high degree of symmetry, we can choose the rhombus-shaped domain $D$ such that the problem of finding a horizontal crossing is geometrically identical to finding a vertical crossing. A rotation of the lattice and domain by $60$ degrees (or $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ radians) transforms the horizontal crossing problem into the vertical crossing problem. Consequently, their probabilities must be equal:\n$$\\pi_H(f, D) = \\pi_V(f, D) \\quad \\text{for all } f$$\nThis symmetry allows us to simplify the general crossing relation for the specific case of the triangular lattice:\n$$\\pi_H(f, D) + \\pi_H(1-f, D) = 1$$\nThis equation holds for any domain size. The percolation threshold $f_c$ is defined in the infinite-lattice limit ($D \\to L$). In this limit, the crossing probability $\\pi_H(f) = \\lim_{D \\to L} \\pi_H(f, D)$ exhibits a sharp transition:\n$$\n\\pi_H(f) =\n\\begin{cases}\n0  \\text{if } f  f_c \\\\\n1  \\text{if } f  f_c\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nAt the critical point $f = f_c$, the system is scale-invariant, and the crossing probability takes a non-trivial value between $0$ and $1$. Let's analyze the equation $\\pi_H(f) + \\pi_H(1-f) = 1$ at the threshold $f=f_c$.\n\nSuppose $f_c \\neq \\frac{1}{2}$. For instance, let's assume $f_c  \\frac{1}{2}$. This would imply $1-f_c  f_c$. In the infinite-limit, because $1-f_c$ is below the threshold, $\\pi_H(1-f_c) = 0$. The equation would then become $\\pi_H(f_c) + 0 = 1$, which means $\\pi_H(f_c) = 1$. This contradicts the fact that the crossing probability at criticality must be strictly between $0$ and $1$.\n\nSimilarly, if we assume $f_c  \\frac{1}{2}$, this would imply $1-f_c  f_c$. Because $1-f_c$ is above the threshold, $\\pi_H(1-f_c) = 1$. The equation would become $\\pi_H(f_c) + 1 = 1$, which means $\\pi_H(f_c) = 0$. This also contradicts the nature of the critical point.\n\nThe only self-consistent solution that avoids these contradictions is if the arguments of the two terms are equal at the critical point:\n$$f_c = 1 - f_c$$\nSolving this equation for $f_c$ yields:\n$$2f_c = 1$$\n$$f_c = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nWhen $f = f_c = \\frac{1}{2}$, the crossing relation becomes $\\pi_H(\\frac{1}{2}) + \\pi_H(\\frac{1}{2}) = 1$, which gives $\\pi_H(\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}$. This result—a crossing probability of exactly $\\frac{1}{2}$ at the critical point—is a hallmark of criticality in such symmetric systems and confirms the consistency of the solution.\n\nThus, the exact percolation threshold for site percolation on a regular triangular lattice is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Below this value, an ionically conducting path almost surely does not span the battery's cathode in the limit of a large number of contact patches.",
