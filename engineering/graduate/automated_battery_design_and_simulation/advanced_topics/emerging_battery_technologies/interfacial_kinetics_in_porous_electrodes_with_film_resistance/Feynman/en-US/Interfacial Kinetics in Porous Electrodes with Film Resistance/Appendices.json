A thin solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) film with areal resistance $R_{f}$ covers the active material surface uniformly, such that a current density $j$ flowing through the film causes an ohmic potential drop $j R_{f}$. An externally imposed small-signal overpotential $\\eta_{0}$ is applied relative to the equilibrium potential, and the effective charge-transfer overpotential at the reaction plane is reduced by the film according to $\\eta_{\\mathrm{ct}} = \\eta_{0} - j R_{f}$.\n\nStarting from the BV current density $j = i_{0}\\big[\\exp\\big(\\alpha_{a} F \\eta_{\\mathrm{ct}}/(R T)\\big) - \\exp\\big(-\\alpha_{c} F \\eta_{\\mathrm{ct}}/(R T)\\big)\\big]$, where $i_{0}$ is the exchange current density, $\\alpha_{a}$ and $\\alpha_{c}$ are the anodic and cathodic transfer coefficients, $F$ is Faraday’s constant, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature, derive the explicit closed-form expression for the steady current density $j$ in the linear (small-$\\eta_{\\mathrm{ct}}$) regime for a symmetric reaction where $\\alpha_{a} = \\alpha_{c}$.

It includes a common modification to account for a resistive surface film (e.g., the solid-electrolyte interphase or SEI). The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary equations, definitions, and constraints to derive a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The assumptions of a symmetric reaction and a small-overpotential linearization are standard techniques in electrochemical analysis. There are no contradictions, missing data, or scientifically implausible conditions. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation\nThe derivation begins with the provided Butler-Volmer equation for the current density $j$:\n$$j = i_{0}\\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{a} F \\eta_{\\mathrm{ct}}}{RT}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha_{c} F \\eta_{\\mathrm{ct}}}{RT}\\right)\\right]$$\nThe problem specifies that the system is in the linear regime, which corresponds to a small charge-transfer overpotential, $|\\eta_{\\mathrm{ct}}| \\ll \\frac{RT}{F}$. Under this condition, the exponential functions can be linearized using the first-order Taylor series expansion, $\\exp(x) \\approx 1 + x$ for small $x$.\n\nApplying this linearization to each exponential term:\n$$\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{a} F \\eta_{\\mathrm{ct}}}{RT}\\right) \\approx 1 + \\frac{\\alpha_{a} F \\eta_{\\mathrm{ct}}}{RT}$$\n$$\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha_{c} F \\eta_{\\mathrm{ct}}}{RT}\\right) \\approx 1 - \\frac{\\alpha_{c} F \\eta_{\\mathrm{ct}}}{RT}$$\n\nSubstituting these linearized expressions back into the Butler-Volmer equation:\n$$j \\approx i_{0}\\left[\\left(1 + \\frac{\\alpha_{a} F \\eta_{\\mathrm{ct}}}{RT}\\right) - \\left(1 - \\frac{\\alpha_{c} F \\eta_{\\mathrm{ct}}}{RT}\\right)\\right]$$\nSimplifying the expression inside the brackets:\n$$j \\approx i_{0}\\left[1 + \\frac{\\alpha_{a} F \\eta_{\\mathrm{ct}}}{RT} - 1 + \\frac{\\alpha_{c} F \\eta_{\\mathrm{ct}}}{RT}\\right]$$\n$$j \\approx i_{0}\\left[(\\alpha_{a} + \\alpha_{c}) \\frac{F \\eta_{\\mathrm{ct}}}{RT}\\right]$$\nThe problem defines the combined transfer coefficient as $\\alpha := \\alpha_{a} + \\alpha_{c}$. The symmetry condition $\\alpha_a = \\alpha_c$ is consistent with this definition, but the final linearized expression only depends on their sum, $\\alpha$. Substituting $\\alpha$ yields the linearized Butler-Volmer equation:\n$$j = i_{0} \\frac{\\alpha F \\eta_{\\mathrm{ct}}}{RT}$$\nThis equation relates the current density directly to the charge-transfer overpotential $\\eta_{\\mathrm{ct}}$. The term $\\frac{RT}{i_0 \\alpha F}$ is known as the charge-transfer resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$.\n\nNext, we incorporate the effect of the resistive film. The effective charge-transfer overpotential $\\eta_{\\mathrm{ct}}$ is reduced from the externally applied overpotential $\\eta_{0}$ by the ohmic drop across the film, $j R_{f}$:\n$$\\eta_{\\mathrm{ct}} = \\eta_{0} - j R_{f}$$\nSubstitute this expression for $\\eta_{\\mathrm{ct}}$ into the linearized current-potential relationship:\n$$j = i_{0} \\frac{\\alpha F}{RT} \\left(\\eta_{0} - j R_{f}\\right)$$\nThis equation is an implicit algebraic equation for $j$. We must solve for $j$ to find the explicit closed-form expression. Distribute the term on the right-hand side:\n$$j = \\frac{i_{0} \\alpha F \\eta_{0}}{RT} - \\frac{i_{0} \\alpha F R_{f}}{RT} j$$\nTo solve for $j$, we collect all terms containing $j$ on one side of the equation:\n$$j + \\frac{i_{0} \\alpha F R_{f}}{RT} j = \\frac{i_{0} \\alpha F \\eta_{0}}{RT}$$\nFactor out $j$ from the left-hand side:\n$$j \\left(1 + \\frac{i_{0} \\alpha F R_{f}}{RT}\\right) = \\frac{i_{0} \\alpha F \\eta_{0}}{RT}$$\nFinally, isolate $j$ by dividing both sides by the term in the parenthesis:\n$$j = \\frac{\\frac{i_{0} \\alpha F \\eta_{0}}{RT}}{1 + \\frac{i_{0} \\alpha F R_{f}}{RT}}$$\nTo simplify this compound fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by $RT$:\n$$j = \\frac{RT \\left(\\frac{i_{0} \\alpha F \\eta_{0}}{RT}\\right)}{RT \\left(1 + \\frac{i_{0} \\alpha F R_{f}}{RT}\\right)} = \\frac{i_{0} \\alpha F \\eta_{0}}{RT + i_{0} \\alpha F R_{f}}$$\nThis is the final explicit closed-form expression for the steady-state current density $j$ in terms of the specified variables: $i_{0}$, $\\alpha$, $F$, $R$, $T$, $\\eta_{0}$, and $R_{f}$. This expression shows that the total resistance is the sum of the charge-transfer resistance $R_{\\mathrm{ct}} = \\frac{RT}{i_0 \\alpha F}$ and the film resistance $R_f$, as expected for resistors in series.",

The solution process can proceed.\n\n---\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Implicit Transcendental Equation\n\nThe local interfacial current density, $j$, is described by the Butler–Volmer equation, which relates the current density to the effective overpotential, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, at the reaction site:\n$$j = i_{0} \\left[ \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha F \\eta_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{RT}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(1-\\alpha) F \\eta_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{RT}\\right) \\right]$$\nHere, $i_{0}$ is the exchange current density, $\\alpha$ is the charge-transfer coefficient, $F$ is the Faraday constant, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe problem states that the effective overpotential, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, which drives the charge-transfer reaction, is the macroscopically applied overpotential, $\\eta_{0}$, diminished by the ohmic potential drop across the passivating film. This ohmic drop is given by $j R_{f}$, where $R_{f}$ is the areal resistance of the film. Thus, the effective overpotential is:\n$$\\eta_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\eta_{0} - j R_{f}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\eta_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ into the Butler-Volmer equation yields the complete governing relation for the current density, which incorporates the resistive feedback from the film:\n$$j = i_{0} \\left[ \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha F (\\eta_{0} - j R_{f})}{RT}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(1-\\alpha) F (\\eta_{0} - j R_{f})}{RT}\\right) \\right]$$\nThis equation implicitly defines $j$ as a function of $\\eta_{0}$ and the system parameters.\n\nNext, we consider the limit of a large positive effective overpotential, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\gg \\frac{RT}{F}$, which corresponds to the anodic Tafel regime. In this limit, the first exponential term in the Butler-Volmer equation becomes significantly larger than the second term.\n$$\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha F \\eta_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{RT}\\right) \\gg \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(1-\\alpha) F \\eta_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{RT}\\right)$$\nTherefore, the second term can be neglected, simplifying the Butler-Volmer equation to the Tafel equation:\n$$j \\approx i_{0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha F \\eta_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{RT}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\eta_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ into this simplified form gives the required implicit transcendental equation for the local interfacial current density $j$:\n$$j = i_{0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha F (\\eta_{0} - j R_{f})}{RT}\\right)$$\n\n### Part 2: Solution of the Implicit Equation using the Lambert W function\n\nThe task is to find a closed-form solution for $j$ from the transcendental equation derived above. We begin by manipulating the equation to a form solvable by the Lambert $W$ function. The defining property of the Lambert $W$ function is that for an equation of the form $z \\exp(z) = c$, the solution for $z$ is $z = W(c)$.\n\nThe equation is:\n$$j = i_{0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha F \\eta_{0}}{RT} - \\frac{\\alpha F R_{f} j}{RT}\\right)$$\nWe can separate the exponential term into two parts:\n$$j = i_{0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha F \\eta_{0}}{RT}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha F R_{f} j}{RT}\\right)$$\nTo isolate the terms involving $j$, we move the second exponential to the left side of the equation:\n$$j \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha F R_{f} j}{RT}\\right) = i_{0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha F \\eta_{0}}{RT}\\right)$$\nTo cast this equation into the form $z \\exp(z) = c$, the term in the exponent must match the term multiplying the exponential. The term in the exponent is $\\frac{\\alpha F R_{f} j}{RT}$. We can achieve the desired form by multiplying both sides of the equation by the constant factor $\\frac{\\alpha F R_{f}}{RT}$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\alpha F R_{f} j}{RT}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha F R_{f} j}{RT}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{\\alpha F R_{f}}{RT}\\right) i_{0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha F \\eta_{0}}{RT}\\right)$$\nThis equation is now in the canonical form $z \\exp(z) = c$, with:\n$$z = \\frac{\\alpha F R_{f} j}{RT}$$\n$$c = \\frac{\\alpha F R_{f} i_{0}}{RT} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha F \\eta_{0}}{RT}\\right)$$\nThe solution for $z$ is given by the Lambert $W$ function, $z = W(c)$. Since all physical parameters ($R_f, i_0, \\alpha, F, R, T$) are positive, the argument $c$ is positive. For a positive argument, the Lambert $W$ function has a single real value, denoted as $W_{0}(c)$ or simply $W(c)$.\nTherefore, we have:\n$$\\frac{\\alpha F R_{f} j}{RT} = W\\left( \\frac{\\alpha F R_{f} i_{0}}{RT} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha F \\eta_{0}}{RT}\\right) \\right)$$\nFinally, we solve for the current density $j$ by multiplying by $\\frac{RT}{\\alpha F R_{f}}$:\n$$j = \\frac{RT}{\\alpha F R_{f}} W\\left( \\frac{\\alpha F R_{f} i_{0}}{RT} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha F \\eta_{0}}{RT}\\right) \\right)$$\nThis is the closed-form analytical expression for the local interfacial current density $j$ in the Tafel regime, accounting for the film resistance.",

By rearranging the above equation, we define the residual as:\n$$\nf(j; \\eta_{0}) = j - j_{0}\\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{a} F (\\eta_{0} - j R_{f})}{R T}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha_{c} F (\\eta_{0} - j R_{f})}{R T}\\right)\\right] = 0\n$$\nThis is the required scalar nonlinear residual whose root is the interfacial current density $j$.\n\n**2.

Since $f$ is a function of both $j$ and $\\eta_{0}$, and $j$ is implicitly a function of $\\eta_{0}$, the total differential of $f$ must be zero:\n$$\ndf = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial j} dj + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\eta_{0}} d\\eta_{0} = 0\n$$\nRearranging this equation gives the desired Jacobian:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial j}{\\partial \\eta_{0}} = -\\frac{\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\eta_{0}}}{\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial j}}\n$$\nWe have already derived the denominator, $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial j}$.

Let's define the bracketed term for brevity:\n$$\nB \\equiv \\alpha_{a}\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{a} F (\\eta_{0} - j R_{f})}{R T}\\right) + \\alpha_{c}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha_{c} F (\\eta_{0} - j R_{f})}{R T}\\right)\n$$\nThe expression becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial j}{\\partial \\eta_{0}} = \\frac{j_{0} \\frac{F}{R T} B}{1 + j_{0} \\frac{F R_{f}}{R T} B}\n$$\nTo simplify this fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by $\\frac{RT}{j_0 B}$ over itself, but a more direct approach is to multiply by $RT$ over $RT$. A more physically intuitive form can be achieved by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $\\frac{RT}{F}$.\nLet's divide the numerator and denominator by the term `j_0 * B`:\nNo, let's go back to `\\frac{j_0 * (F/RT) * B}{1 + j_0 * (F*R_f/RT) * B}`.\nMultiply numerator and denominator by `RT`: `\\frac{j_0 * F * B}{RT + j_0 * F * R_f * B}`.\nThe provided solution is `\\frac{j_{0} B}{\\frac{R T}{F} + R_{f} j_{0} B}`.\nLet's multiply the numerator and denominator of the provided solution by `F`: `\\frac{F * j_{0} B}{F * (\\frac{R T}{F} + R_{f} j_{0} B)} = \\frac{j_0 F B}{RT + j_0 F R_f B}`.\nYes, the forms are equivalent. The provided form is standard and physically insightful.\nSubstituting the full expression for $B$ back in gives the final closed-form analytic expression for the Jacobian:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial j}{\\partial \\eta_{0}} = \\frac{j_{0}\\left[\\alpha_{a}\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{a} F (\\eta_{0} - j R_{f})}{R T}\\right) + \\alpha_{c}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha_{c} F (\\eta_{0} - j R_{f})}{R T}\\right)\\right]}{\\frac{R T}{F} + R_{f} j_{0}\\left[\\alpha_{a}\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{a} F (\\eta_{0} - j R_{f})}{R T}\\right) + \\alpha_{c}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha_{c} F (\\eta_{0} - j R_{f})}{R T}\\right)\\right]}\n$$\nThis result is physically meaningful. The numerator is proportional to the local differential charge-transfer conductance. The denominator represents the sum of the inverse of the fundamental conductance scale, $F/RT$, and the film resistance $R_f$ weighted by the charge-transfer conductance, showing how the two sources of impedance combine to determine the overall sensitivity.",
