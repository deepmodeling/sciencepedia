## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The preceding chapters have established the theoretical and algorithmic foundations of Polynomial Chaos Expansions (PCE). We now pivot from principles to practice, exploring how PCE is leveraged as a powerful and versatile tool for Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) across a multitude of scientific and engineering disciplines. The objective of this chapter is not to reteach the core mechanics of PCE, but to demonstrate its profound utility in solving complex, real-world problems. We will examine how the abstract framework of orthogonal polynomial expansions translates into concrete methodologies for characterizing uncertainty, performing sensitivity analysis, enabling robust design, and handling high-dimensional, dynamic, and multi-physics systems. Through a series of application-oriented contexts, we will see that PCE is not merely a mathematical technique but a cornerstone of modern computational science, enabling deeper insight and more reliable predictions in the face of uncertainty.

### The Foundation of Application: Characterizing Input Uncertainty

Every [uncertainty quantification](@entry_id:138597) workflow begins with a critical first step: the characterization of the uncertain inputs. The validity and usefulness of any propagated uncertainty are contingent upon a realistic and mathematically sound representation of the sources of that uncertainty. PCE provides a rigorous framework that links the probabilistic description of inputs to the choice of computational basis, a principle embodied in the Wiener-Askey scheme.

Physical parameters are often constrained by their nature. For instance, quantities representing fractions or proportions, such as the porosity $\varepsilon$ of a battery electrode, are physically bounded, typically within the interval $(0, 1)$. For such variables, the Beta distribution is an exceptionally suitable model. Its support is naturally confined to $(0, 1)$, and its two [shape parameters](@entry_id:270600), $\alpha$ and $\beta$, afford great flexibility to capture a wide variety of distributional shapes—from symmetric and bell-shaped to skewed or U-shaped—that may arise from different manufacturing processes. The parameters $(\alpha, \beta)$ can be systematically determined from empirical data, for example, by matching the distribution's theoretical mean and variance to the sample mean $\hat{\mu}$ and variance $\hat{\sigma}^2$ obtained from measurements. This direct link between empirical statistics and a well-defined probability distribution is a crucial step in building a defensible UQ model. Furthermore, the selection of a Beta distribution directly informs the PCE construction, prescribing the use of Jacobi polynomials, which are orthogonal with respect to the Beta probability measure. This synergy simplifies the computation of PCE coefficients, particularly for non-intrusive [projection methods](@entry_id:147401) .

Similarly, many physical parameters, such as kinetic [rate constants](@entry_id:196199) or material diffusion coefficients, must be strictly positive. The Lognormal distribution is a common and effective model for such quantities, as it is defined only for positive values and often reflects underlying multiplicative error processes. A lognormal random variable $D_s$ can be represented as an exponential function of a Gaussian random variable $\xi \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$, i.e., $D_s = \exp(\mu + \sigma\xi)$. This transformation is central to PCE applications. It maps the uncertainty from the physical parameter $D_s$ to a canonical random variable $\xi$ with a [standard normal distribution](@entry_id:184509). According to the Wiener-Askey scheme, the appropriate orthogonal polynomial basis for a standard normal variable is the Hermite polynomial family. Therefore, by performing this transformation, a complex, physically-constrained uncertainty can be represented using a standard and computationally convenient polynomial basis, allowing for a straightforward PCE construction for any model output that depends on $D_s$ .

### Core Application: Surrogate Modeling for Propagation and Analysis

Perhaps the most prevalent application of PCE is the construction of computationally inexpensive surrogate models. For complex, high-fidelity simulations that may take hours or days to run, a PCE surrogate, once constructed, can be evaluated virtually instantaneously. This enables comprehensive UQ analyses that would otherwise be computationally prohibitive.

#### Global Sensitivity Analysis

A key output of a PCE-based UQ analysis is Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA). Because a PCE surrogate decomposes the model output variance into contributions from individual input parameters and their interactions, variance-based sensitivity indices (Sobol indices) can be computed analytically and at negligible cost directly from the PCE coefficients. The first-order Sobol index $S_i$ for an input $\xi_i$ is the sum of squares of all coefficients corresponding to basis functions that depend only on $\xi_i$, divided by the total variance. The [total-order index](@entry_id:166452) $S_{T,i}$ includes all terms involving $\xi_i$, including its interactions with other parameters.

This capability is particularly powerful for dynamic systems, where sensitivities can evolve over time. Consider the voltage of a battery during a constant-current discharge, which depends on uncertain parameters like contact resistance ($R_c$), solid-phase diffusivity ($D_s$), and [exchange current density](@entry_id:159311) ($i_0$). By constructing a time-resolved PCE, where the coefficients are functions of time, one can track the evolution of Sobol indices throughout the discharge process. An analysis might reveal that at the beginning of discharge ($t \approx 0$), the voltage drop is dominated by ohmic effects, making the model output highly sensitive to uncertainty in $R_c$. As the discharge proceeds and concentration gradients build up within the electrode particles, [mass transport](@entry_id:151908) limitations become more significant, and the sensitivity to $D_s$ may grow to dominate by mid-discharge. Near the end of discharge, as reactants are depleted, kinetic and transport limitations may become strongly coupled, leading to a rise in interaction effects, for instance, between $D_s$ and $i_0$. Such an analysis provides invaluable physical insight, identifying which physical processes and corresponding parameters control the system's performance at different operational stages .

Furthermore, PCE allows for a deep dive into these interaction effects. Higher-order Sobol indices, which quantify the fraction of output variance due to the synergistic interaction of two or more parameters, are also readily available from the PCE coefficients. For example, in modeling electrode overpotential, a significant interaction index between the diffusion coefficient $D_s$ and the kinetic rate constant $k$ indicates that the effect of one parameter is conditional on the value of the other. If diffusion is the primary bottleneck (low $D_s$), variations in kinetics (uncertainty in $k$) may have a muted effect on the total overpotential. The PCE-derived interaction index quantifies this non-additive behavior, highlighting which parameter uncertainties must be considered jointly for robust design and analysis .

#### Reliability Analysis and Risk Assessment

PCE surrogates are also instrumental in [reliability analysis](@entry_id:192790), where the goal is to compute the probability of a system failure. Failure is typically defined by a limit-state function $g(\boldsymbol{\xi})$ being less than zero. Computing the probability of failure, $P_f = P(g  0)$, often involves integrating a complex function over a small region of a high-dimensional space, a task for which standard Monte Carlo methods can be inefficient.

By replacing the computationally expensive model within the limit-[state function](@entry_id:141111) with its PCE surrogate, this calculation becomes tractable. For instance, in biomechanics, the risk of an atherosclerotic plaque rupturing can be assessed by comparing the peak stress in the plaque's fibrous cap, $\sigma_{\max}(\boldsymbol{\xi})$, to its [material strength](@entry_id:136917), $S$. The limit-state function is $g(\boldsymbol{\xi}, S) = S - \sigma_{\max}(\boldsymbol{\xi})$. With a PCE surrogate for $\sigma_{\max}$, the mean and variance of the limit-[state function](@entry_id:141111) can be computed analytically from the PCE coefficients and the moments of $S$. A common and effective approach, known as a first-order reliability method (FORM) or moment-matching, is to approximate the distribution of $g$ as Gaussian. The probability of failure is then estimated by evaluating the standard normal [cumulative distribution function](@entry_id:143135) (CDF), a trivial calculation once the mean and variance of $g$ are known. This PCE-based approach provides a rapid and robust estimate of rupture risk, enabling patient-specific [risk stratification](@entry_id:261752) with far fewer simulations than would be required for a full Monte Carlo analysis . This same framework extends to Reliability-Based Design Optimization (RBDO), where the goal is to find an optimal design that satisfies a probabilistic constraint, such as keeping the probability of failure below a target threshold. The PCE surrogate enables the efficient evaluation of this probabilistic constraint and its gradients within an optimization loop .

### Advanced PCE Techniques for Complex Systems

The versatility of PCE extends far beyond its basic application to scalar outputs. Advanced formulations have been developed to tackle the challenges posed by high-dimensional, dynamic, and multi-physics systems, and to maximize [computational efficiency](@entry_id:270255).

#### Handling Spatially and Temporally Distributed Uncertainty

Many physical systems involve uncertainty that is distributed in space or time, such as a spatially varying material property or a stochastic time-series load. These represent infinite-dimensional sources of uncertainty, which must be discretized into a finite number of random variables before PCE can be applied.

A cornerstone technique for this is the **Karhunen-Loève (KL) Expansion**. The KL expansion is a [spectral decomposition](@entry_id:148809) of a [random field](@entry_id:268702) or process, analogous to a Fourier series for a deterministic function. It represents a random field, such as the wind speed $Z(x)$ over a spatial domain, as a series of deterministic [orthonormal basis functions](@entry_id:193867) $\phi_k(x)$ (the eigenfunctions) multiplied by uncorrelated random coefficients $\xi_k$. The eigenfunctions and their corresponding eigenvalues $\lambda_k$ are found by solving an integral eigenproblem where the kernel is the [covariance function](@entry_id:265031) of the random field. For a Gaussian [random field](@entry_id:268702), the resulting coefficients $\xi_k$ are independent standard normal variables. By truncating the KL expansion, the infinite-dimensional random field is approximated by a finite sum, $Z(x) \approx \bar{Z}(x) + \sum_{k=1}^m \sqrt{\lambda_k} \phi_k(x) \xi_k$. The set of $m$ random variables $\{\xi_k\}_{k=1}^m$ now serves as the input for a standard PCE, allowing the propagation of [spatial uncertainty](@entry_id:755145) through a subsequent model .

For outputs that are themselves time-series or fields, a similar dimensionality reduction strategy can be employed. **Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)**, also known as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used to extract a set of optimal, deterministic basis functions (or modes) from an ensemble of simulation snapshots. For a time-dependent output $V(t, \boldsymbol{\xi})$, this allows for a representation $V(t, \boldsymbol{\xi}) \approx \bar{V}(t) + \sum_{m=1}^M a_m(\boldsymbol{\xi}) \psi_m(t)$, where $\psi_m(t)$ are the deterministic temporal POD modes and $a_m(\boldsymbol{\xi})$ are random [modal coefficients](@entry_id:752057). The problem is thus transformed from modeling an entire [random process](@entry_id:269605) to modeling a small set of random variables. Each of these random coefficients $a_m(\boldsymbol{\xi})$ can then be expanded using PCE. This powerful POD-PCE combination enables the efficient construction of [surrogate models](@entry_id:145436) for entire dynamic system responses, capturing both the temporal structure and the stochastic dependence on input parameters  .

#### Enhancing Computational Efficiency

Even with a surrogate, constructing the PCE itself can be expensive if it requires many evaluations of a high-fidelity model. Several advanced strategies aim to mitigate this cost.

**Multi-fidelity methods** leverage information from cheaper, lower-fidelity models to reduce the number of expensive high-fidelity simulations needed. For instance, in battery modeling, a full Pseudo-Two-Dimensional (P2D) model can be very slow, while a Single-Particle Model with electrolyte effects (SPMe) is much faster but less accurate. An autoregressive [co-kriging](@entry_id:747413) scheme can formally link the outputs of these two models via a relation like $Y_H(\boldsymbol{\xi}) = \rho Y_L(\boldsymbol{\xi}) + \Delta(\boldsymbol{\xi})$, where $Y_H$ and $Y_L$ are the high- and low-fidelity outputs, $\rho$ is a correlation factor, and $\Delta(\boldsymbol{\xi})$ is a discrepancy function. By constructing a PCE for the cheap model $Y_L$ and a separate PCE for the discrepancy $\Delta$, which can be built with very few high-fidelity runs, one can construct an accurate PCE for the high-fidelity output $Y_H$. This approach intelligently fuses information from different sources to build a high-quality surrogate at a fraction of the standard cost .

The applicability of PCE to **high-dimensional problems** (e.g., $d  10$ inputs) is another critical consideration. While the number of terms in a total-order PCE basis grows polynomially with dimension (the "curse of dimensionality"), the method can remain highly effective if the underlying model exhibits sufficient regularity. For many physical models described by partial differential equations, the solution's dependence on the input parameters is analytic. This regularity leads to [spectral convergence](@entry_id:142546) of the PCE, meaning the coefficients decay faster than any algebraic rate. This rapid decay often implies that most of the output variance is captured by low-order polynomials and interactions, allowing for accurate approximations with low-degree, sparse, or dimension-adaptive PCEs. The mean-square truncation error, which is the sum of the squares of the omitted coefficients, can be estimated and used to guide the choice of truncation, ensuring sufficient accuracy is achieved .

#### Intrusive vs. Non-Intrusive Methods

The majority of modern PCE applications use a **non-intrusive** approach, where the simulation code is treated as a "black box" that is simply executed for different input samples. However, the original formulation of PCE was **intrusive**. In the intrusive Galerkin method, the PCE representations for the inputs and outputs are substituted directly into the governing equations (e.g., a system of ODEs or PDEs). The resulting equations are then projected onto the polynomial basis functions. This process transforms the [stochastic differential equations](@entry_id:146618) into a larger, coupled system of deterministic equations for the time-dependent PCE coefficients. For a coupled [electro-thermal model](@entry_id:1124256), for example, this projection results in a block-structured system of ODEs. Nonlinear terms or parametric products in the original equations (like a Joule heating term $\beta(\xi)V(\xi)$) manifest as coupling terms between different coefficient equations. The structure of this coupling is determined by triple-product tensors, which are the inner products of three basis polynomials. While intrusive methods require modification of the source code and can be complex to implement, they can be highly efficient for certain classes of problems .

#### Embedding Physical Constraints

A hallmark of a high-quality surrogate model is its adherence to the fundamental physical laws governing the system. Advanced PCE formulations allow for the direct embedding of such constraints. A prime example comes from Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). The [complex impedance](@entry_id:273113) $Z(\omega)$ of any linear, time-invariant, [causal system](@entry_id:267557) must obey the Kramers-Kronig (KK) relations, which are Hilbert transform pairs linking its real and imaginary parts. A naive PCE that expands the real and imaginary parts of impedance independently would likely violate this fundamental constraint. A more elegant approach is to construct the surrogate such that it is KK-consistent by design. This can be achieved by expanding the frequency-dependent PCE coefficients themselves onto a basis of functions that are individually KK-consistent (e.g., single-relaxation Debye models). By forcing the real and imaginary coefficient parts to share the same weights on this basis, KK-consistency is guaranteed for the entire surrogate. This "physics-informed" approach leads to more robust and accurate surrogates that respect the underlying structure of the problem .
