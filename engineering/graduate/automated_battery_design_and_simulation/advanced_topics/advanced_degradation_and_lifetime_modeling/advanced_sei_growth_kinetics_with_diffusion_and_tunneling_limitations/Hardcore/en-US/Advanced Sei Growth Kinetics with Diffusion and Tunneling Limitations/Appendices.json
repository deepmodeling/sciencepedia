In an automated battery design workflow, a scaling estimate for the time to reach a passivation thickness is needed to set model time horizons and convergence criteria for parametric simulations. Assume the following physically motivated base, consistent with quantum tunneling and Faraday’s law:\n\n1. The electron transmission probability through a rectangular barrier of thickness $L$ and effective barrier height $\\phi$ obeys $T(L) \\sim \\exp(-2 \\kappa L)$, where $\\kappa = \\sqrt{2 m_{e} \\phi}/\\hbar$, $m_e$ is the electron mass, and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n2. The electron current density available at the electrolyte/SEI interface for SEI-forming reactions scales as $J_{e}(L) = J_{0} \\exp(-\\alpha L)$, where $J_{0}$ is a constant prefactor capturing the interfacial electronic density of states and bias conditions, and $\\alpha$ is the effective tunneling decay constant (take $\\alpha = 2 \\kappa$ for a rectangular barrier, but do not substitute this into the final expression; carry $\\alpha$ symbolically).\n3.

The growth mechanism is based on two fundamental principles: quantum mechanical tunneling for electron transport across the insulating SEI layer (described by a Gamow-type exponential decay) and Faraday's law of electrolysis for the conversion of electron current into material growth. This model is a standard representation of tunneling-limited kinetics, often referred to in the context of thin film oxidation and passivation phenomena (e.g., Mott-Cabrera theory). The assumptions are clearly stated.

We can therefore evaluate the integrals.\n\nFor the left-hand side:\n$$\n\\int_{L_{0}}^{L_{p}} \\exp(\\alpha L) dL = \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\exp(\\alpha L) \\right]_{L_{0}}^{L_{p}} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\left( \\exp(\\alpha L_{p}) - \\exp(\\alpha L_{0}) \\right)\n$$\nFor the right-hand side:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t_{p}} \\frac{\\bar{V} J_{0}}{n F} dt = \\frac{\\bar{V} J_{0}}{n F} \\int_{0}^{t_{p}} dt = \\frac{\\bar{V} J_{0}}{n F} [t]_{0}^{t_{p}} = \\frac{\\bar{V} J_{0}}{n F} t_{p}\n$$\nEquating the results from the left-hand side and right-hand side gives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\left( \\exp(\\alpha L_{p}) - \\exp(\\alpha L_{0}) \\right) = \\frac{\\bar{V} J_{0}}{n F} t_{p}\n$$\nTo find the expression for the passivation time $t_{p}$, we rearrange the equation to solve for $t_{p}$:\n$$\nt_{p} = \\frac{n F}{\\alpha \\bar{V} J_{0}} \\left( \\exp(\\alpha L_{p}) - \\exp(\\alpha L_{0}) \\right)\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the time required to reach the passivation thickness $L_{p}$ starting from an initial thickness $L_{0}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on standard physical models for diffusion, reaction kinetics, and quantum tunneling, and it is structured to admit a unique and meaningful solution. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe transport of $\\text{Li}^+$ ions through the Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) is described by one-dimensional steady-state diffusion. The governing equation arises from the species conservation principle, which states that in the absence of sources or sinks within the bulk medium, the divergence of the flux is zero. In one dimension, this is expressed as $\\frac{dJ}{dx} = 0$. This implies that the molar flux $J$ is constant throughout the SEI film, i.e., $J(x) = J$.\n\nAccording to Fick's first law, the diffusive flux is related to the concentration gradient by $J = -D \\frac{dc}{dx}$, where $D$ is the constant diffusivity. Combining these two statements, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(-D \\frac{dc}{dx}\\right) = 0\n$$\nSince $D$ is a constant, this simplifies to the steady-state diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2c}{dx^2} = 0\n$$\nThis is a second-order ordinary differential equation for the concentration profile $c(x)$.\n\nTo solve this equation, we need two boundary conditions.\n1.  At the interface with the electrolyte, $x=0$, the concentration is fixed:\n    $$\n    c(0) = c_{0}\n    $$\n2.  At the inner SEI interface, $x=L$, lithium ions are consumed by a reaction. The principle of flux continuity requires that the diffusive flux arriving at this interface must be equal to the rate of consumption per unit area, $R$. The diffusive flux at $x=L$ is $J(L) = -D \\left.\\frac{dc}{dx}\\right|_{x=L}$. The reaction rate is given as $R = k(L)c(L)$. Equating these provides the boundary condition at $x=L$:\n    $$\n    -D \\left.\\frac{dc}{dx}\\right|_{x=L} = k(L)c(L)\n    $$\n    This is the required mixed (or Robin) boundary condition that couples diffusion and reaction kinetics.\n\nNow, we solve the governing equation. Integrating $\\frac{d^2c}{dx^2} = 0$ twice with respect to $x$ yields the general solution for the concentration profile:\n$$\nc(x) = A x + B\n$$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are integration constants. We determine these constants using the boundary conditions.\n\nApplying the boundary condition at $x=0$:\n$$\nc(0) = A(0) + B = c_{0} \\implies B = c_{0}\n$$\nThe concentration profile thus becomes:\n$$\nc(x) = A x + c_{0}\n$$\nThe concentration gradient is $\\frac{dc}{dx} = A$.\n\nNext, we apply the boundary condition at $x=L$:\n$$\n-D (A) = k(L) c(L)\n$$\nSubstituting $c(L) = AL + c_{0}$ into this equation gives:\n$$\n-DA = k(L)(AL + c_{0})\n$$\nWe solve this equation for the constant $A$:\n$$\n-DA = A k(L) L + c_{0} k(L)\n$$\n$$\n-c_{0} k(L) = A(D + k(L)L)\n$$\n$$\nA = -\\frac{c_{0} k(L)}{D + k(L)L}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $A$ back into the equation for $c(x)$, we obtain the full concentration profile:\n$$\nc(x) = c_{0} - \\frac{c_{0} k(L) x}{D + k(L)L} = c_{0} \\left(1 - \\frac{k(L)x}{D + k(L)L}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem also asks for the constant molar flux $J$. The flux is given by $J = -D \\frac{dc}{dx} = -DA$.
