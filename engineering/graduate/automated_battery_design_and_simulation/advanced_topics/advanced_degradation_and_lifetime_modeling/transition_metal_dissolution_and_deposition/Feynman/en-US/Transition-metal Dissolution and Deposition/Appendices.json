            "solution": "The problem requires a two-part analysis based on electrochemical thermodynamics and chemical equilibrium principles. First, we must determine whether the transition metal $M$ will dissolve from or deposit onto the current collector under the specified conditions. Second, we must calculate the threshold free-ion activity, $a_{M^{2+}}^{*}$, at which the system is at equilibrium (i.e., the net rate of dissolution/deposition is zero).\n\nThe electrochemical half-reaction for the metal $M$ is given as:\n$$M^{2+} + 2 e^{-} \\rightleftharpoons M(s)$$\nThe equilibrium potential, $E_{\\mathrm{eq}}$, for this reaction is described by the Nernst equation. For a solid metal phase, its activity is taken as unity, $a_{M(s)}=1$. The Nernst equation is:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{eq}} = E^{0}_{M^{2+}/M} - \\frac{RT}{nF} \\ln\\left(\\frac{a_{M(s)}}{a_{M^{2+}}}\\right)$$\nwhere $E^{0}_{M^{2+}/M}$ is the standard electrode potential, $R$ is the molar gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $n$ is the number of electrons transferred in the half-reaction (here, $n=2$), $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $a_{M^{2+}}$ is the activity of the free metal ion in the electrolyte. With $n=2$ and $a_{M(s)}=1$, the equation simplifies to:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{eq}} = E^{0}_{M^{2+}/M} + \\frac{RT}{2F} \\ln(a_{M^{2+}})$$\n\nThe direction of the reaction at an applied potential $E_{\\mathrm{app}}$ is determined by comparing $E_{\\mathrm{app}}$ to $E_{\\mathrm{eq}}$:\n- If $E_{\\mathrm{app}} > E_{\\mathrm{eq}}$, the applied potential is more positive (oxidizing) than the equilibrium potential, driving the oxidation reaction $M(s) \\rightarrow M^{2+} + 2 e^{-}$.

This occurs when $E_{\\mathrm{eq}} = E_{\\mathrm{app}}$.\n$$E_{\\mathrm{app}} = E^{0}_{M^{2+}/M} + \\frac{RT}{2F} \\ln(a_{M^{2+}}^{*})$$\nSolving for $\\ln(a_{M^{2+}}^{*})$:\n$$\\ln(a_{M^{2+}}^{*}) = (E_{\\mathrm{app}} - E^{0}_{M^{2+}/M}) \\frac{2F}{RT}$$\nAnd for $a_{M^{2+}}^{*}$:\n$$a_{M^{2+}}^{*} = \\exp\\left( (E_{\\mathrm{app}} - E^{0}_{M^{2+}/M}) \\frac{2F}{RT} \\right)$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{app}} = -0.300 \\ \\mathrm{V}$$\n$$E^{0}_{M^{2+}/M} = -0.250 \\ \\mathrm{V}$$\nThe term $\\frac{RT}{F}$ at $T = 298.15$ $\\mathrm{K}$ is approximately $0.025693$ $\\mathrm{V}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the operating cathodic current density for the deposition of a transition-metal ion $\\mathrm{M}^{z+}$ onto a negative electrode. This process involves two sequential steps: the mass transport of ions to the electrode surface via diffusion and the charge transfer reaction (kinetics) at the surface. The overall rate of the process, represented by the operating current density magnitude $|j_{op}|$, is governed by the slower of these two steps. Therefore, the operating current density is the minimum of the diffusion-limited current density, $|j_{lim}|$, and the kinetic current density, $|j_{kin}|$.\n$$|j_{op}| = \\min(|j_{lim}|, |j_{kin}|)$$\nWe will calculate each of these quantities separately and then compare them.\n\nFirst, we determine the diffusion-limited current density, $|j_{lim}|$. This is the maximum rate at which the reaction can occur if it is limited solely by the transport of reactants to the electrode surface. The molar flux, $J$, of the species $\\mathrm{M}^{z+}$ in a one-dimensional system under steady-state conditions is described by Fick's first law of diffusion:\n$$J(x) = -D \\frac{dc}{dx}$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient and $\\frac{dc}{dx}$ is the concentration gradient. Under steady-state conditions with no homogeneous reactions, the flux must be constant across the boundary layer. This implies that the concentration profile, $c(x)$, is linear within the diffusion boundary layer of thickness $\\delta$.\nWe apply the boundary conditions specified for the diffusion-limited case:\n1.  At the outer edge of the boundary layer ($x=\\delta$), the concentration is the bulk concentration: $c(\\delta) = c_{\\infty}$.\n2.  At the electrode surface ($x=0$), the reaction is assumed to be infinitely fast, consuming all ions as they arrive, so the surface concentration is zero: $c(0) = 0$.\n\nFor a linear profile $c(x) = mx + b$, these conditions give $b=0$ and $m\\delta = c_{\\infty}$, so $m = \\frac{c_{\\infty}}{\\delta}$. The concentration profile is thus $c(x) = \\frac{c_{\\infty}}{\\delta}x$.\nThe concentration gradient is constant throughout the layer:\n$$\\frac{dc}{dx} = \\frac{c_{\\infty}}{\\delta}$$\nThe magnitude of the molar flux is $|J| = D \\left| \\frac{dc}{dx} \\right| = D \\frac{c_{\\infty}}{\\delta}$.\nAccording to Faraday's law of electrolysis, the current density, $j$, is proportional to the molar flux of the electroactive species.

The kinetics are described by the Butler-Volmer equation. For a cathodic process, the overpotential $\\eta$ is negative. The problem gives its magnitude $|\\eta|$, so $\\eta = -|\\eta|$.

The open-circuit condition is therefore expressed as the equality of the magnitudes of these partial current densities:\n$$i_{a}(E_{\\mathrm{mix}}) = i_{c}(E_{\\mathrm{mix}})$$\n\nThe problem provides the Tafel expressions for these partial current densities:\n$$i_{a}(E) = i_{0,a}\\,10^{\\frac{E - E_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{b_{a}}}$$\n$$i_{c}(E) = i_{0,c}\\,10^{-\\frac{E - E_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{b_{c}}}$$\nHere, $E$ is the electrode potential, $E_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ is the equilibrium potential, $i_{0,a}$ and $i_{0,c}$ are the exchange current densities for the anodic and cathodic branches, and $b_{a}$ and $b_{c}$ are the respective Tafel slopes.\n\nTo find $E_{\\mathrm{mix}}$, we substitute the Tafel expressions into the open-circuit condition:\n$$i_{0,a}\\,10^{\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{mix}} - E_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{b_{a}}} = i_{0,c}\\,10^{-\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{mix}} - E_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{b_{c}}}$$\nTo solve for $E_{\\mathrm{mix}}$, we take the base-$10$ logarithm of both sides of the equation:\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(i_{0,a}\\,10^{\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{mix}} - E_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{b_{a}}}\\right) = \\log_{10}\\left(i_{0,c}\\,10^{-\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{mix}} - E_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{b_{c}}}\\right)$$\nUsing the logarithm properties $\\log(xy) = \\log(x) + \\log(y)$ and $\\log_{10}(10^z) = z$, we get:\n$$\\log_{10}(i_{0,a}) + \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{mix}} - E_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{b_{a}} = \\log_{10}(i_{0,c}) - \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{mix}} - E_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{b_{c}}$$\nNow, we rearrange the equation to isolate the terms containing $E_{\\mathrm{mix}}$:\n$$\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{mix}}}{b_{a}} + \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{mix}}}{b_{c}} = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{b_{a}} + \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{b_{c}} + \\log_{10}(i_{0,c}) - \\log_{10}(i_{0,a})$$\nFactoring out $E_{\\mathrm{mix}}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{eq}}$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{mix}}\\left(\\frac{1}{b_{a}} + \\frac{1}{b_{c}}\\right) = E_{\\mathrm{eq}}\\left(\\frac{1}{b_{a}} + \\frac{1}{b_{c}}\\right) + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{i_{0,c}}{i_{0,a}}\\right)$$\n$$(E_{\\mathrm{mix}} - E_{\\mathrm{eq}})\\left(\\frac{b_{c} + b_{a}}{b_{a}b_{c}}\\right) = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{i_{0,c}}{i_{0,a}}\\right)$$\nSolving for $(E_{\\mathrm{mix}} - E_{\\mathrm{eq}})$ yields:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{mix}} - E_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{b_{a}b_{c}}{b_{a} + b_{c}} \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{i_{0,c}}{i_{0,a}}\\right)$$\nFinally, the symbolic expression for the mixed potential is:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{mix}} = E_{\\mathrm{eq}} + \\frac{b_{a}b_{c}}{b_{a} + b_{c}} \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{i_{0,c}}{i_{0,a}}\\right)$$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values: $E_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 0.150\\ \\mathrm{V}$, $b_{a} = 0.050\\ \\mathrm{V/decade}$, $b_{c} = 0.100\\ \\mathrm{V/decade}$, $i_{0,a} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{A/cm^{2}}$, and $i_{0,c} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{A/cm^{2}}$.\nThe ratio of the exchange current densities is:\n$$\\frac{i_{0,c}}{i_{0,a}} = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{-8}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-7}} = 0.25$$\nThe logarithmic term is:\n$$\\log_{10}(0.25) \\approx -0.60206$$\nThe combination of Tafel slopes is:\n$$\\frac{b_{a}b_{c}}{b_{a} + b_{c}} = \\frac{(0.050)(0.100)}{0.050 + 0.100} = \\frac{0.005}{0.150} = \\frac{1}{30}\\ \\mathrm{V} \\approx 0.033333\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $E_{\\mathrm{mix}}$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{mix}} \\approx 0.150 + \\left(\\frac{1}{30}\\right)(-0.60206) = 0.150 - 0.0200687\\ \\mathrm{V} = 0.1299313\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the mixed potential is $E_{\\mathrm{mix}} = 0.1299\\ \\mathrm{V}$.\n\nNext, we compute the TM dissolution flux, $j_{\\mathrm{TM}}$. This requires calculating the common current density at the mixed potential, often called the corrosion current density, $i_{\\mathrm{corr}} = i_{a}(E_{\\mathrm{mix}})$.\n$$i_{\\mathrm{corr}} = i_{0,a}\\,10^{\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{mix}} - E_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{b_{a}}}$$\nUsing the previously calculated values:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{mix}} - E_{\\mathrm{eq}} \\approx -0.0200687\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\n$$i_{\\mathrm{corr}} \\approx (2.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{A/cm^{2}}) \\times 10^{\\frac{-0.0200687}{0.050}} = (2.0 \\times 10^{-7}) \\times 10^{-0.401374}$$\n$$i_{\\mathrm{corr}} \\approx (2.0 \\times 10^{-7}) \\times 0.39685 = 7.937 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{A/cm^{2}}$$\nThe dissolution flux is given by Faraday's law:\n$$j_{\\mathrm{TM}} = \\frac{i_{a}(E_{\\mathrm{mix}})}{nF} = \\frac{i_{\\mathrm{corr}}}{nF}$$\nwhere $n=2$ is the number of electrons transferred, and $F=96485\\ \\mathrm{C/mol}$ is the Faraday constant. The current density must be in SI units, i.e., $\\mathrm{A/m^{2}}$. We perform the unit conversion:\n$$1\\ \\mathrm{m^2} = (100\\ \\mathrm{cm})^2 = 10^4\\ \\mathrm{cm^2}$$\n$$i_{\\mathrm{corr}} \\approx (7.937 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{A/cm^{2}}) \\times (10^4\\ \\mathrm{cm^{2}/m^{2}}) = 7.937 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{A/m^{2}}$$\nNow, we calculate the flux:\n$$j_{\\mathrm{TM}} = \\frac{7.937 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{A/m^{2}}}{2 \\times 96485\\ \\mathrm{C/mol}} = \\frac{7.937 \\times 10^{-4}}{192970}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$$\n$$j_{\\mathrm{TM}} \\approx 4.1130 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the dissolution flux is $j_{\\mathrm{TM}} = 4.113 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$.\n\nThe final results are the mixed potential $E_{\\mathrm{mix}} \\approx 0.1299\\ \\mathrm{V}$ and the dissolution flux $j_{\\mathrm{TM}} \\approx 4.113 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$.",
