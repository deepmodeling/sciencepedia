The behavior of the flow—whether it is smooth and orderly (laminar) or chaotic and mixing (turbulent)—dictates the pressure drop and the effectiveness of heat transfer. This practice  guides you through the calculation of two essential dimensionless parameters, the Reynolds number ($Re$) and the Prandtl number ($Pr$), which allow you to quantitatively determine the flow regime and the relative thickness of the thermal boundary layer.",

The total volumetric flow rate supplied to the plate is $Q_{\\text{tot}}$, and it is distributed evenly among the $N$ channels. Each channel has width $w$, height $h$, and length $L$. The coolant is an approximately $50\\%$ ethylene glycol and $50\\%$ water mixture at a uniform bulk temperature, with the following thermophysical properties at that temperature: mass density $\\rho$, dynamic viscosity $\\mu$, thermal conductivity $k$, and constant-pressure specific heat $c_{p}$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of fluid mechanics and heat transfer, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively stated. All provided values are physically realistic for the specified engineering context of a battery cooling system. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe solution requires the determination of the flow regime and thermal characteristics within microchannels of a liquid cooling plate. This involves calculating the mean velocity, a characteristic length, the Reynolds number, and the Prandtl number.\n\nFirst, we must standardize all units to the International System of Units (SI). The given parameters are:\nNumber of channels, $N = 24$.\nTotal volumetric flow rate, $Q_{\\text{tot}} = 1.2~\\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{min}$.\nChannel width, $w = 1.5~\\mathrm{mm}$.\nChannel height, $h = 0.8~\\mathrm{mm}$.\nChannel length, $L = 0.25~\\mathrm{m}$.\nFluid density, $\\rho = 1060~\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{m}^{3}$.\nFluid dynamic viscosity, $\\mu = 2.5 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{Pa}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}$.\nFluid thermal conductivity, $k = 0.38~\\mathrm{W}/(\\mathrm{m}\\cdot\\mathrm{K})$.\nFluid specific heat capacity, $c_{p} = 3700~\\mathrm{J}/(\\mathrm{kg}\\cdot\\mathrm{K})$.\n\nThe necessary conversions to SI units are:\n$Q_{\\text{tot}} = 1.2 \\frac{\\mathrm{L}}{\\mathrm{min}} \\times \\frac{10^{-3}~\\mathrm{m}^3}{1~\\mathrm{L}} \\times \\frac{1~\\mathrm{min}}{60~\\mathrm{s}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{m}^3/\\mathrm{s}$.\n$w = 1.5~\\mathrm{mm} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{m}$.\n$h = 0.8~\\mathrm{mm} = 0.8 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{m}$.\n\n**1. Mean Velocity in a Single Channel**\nThe total flow rate $Q_{\\text{tot}}$ is distributed evenly among $N$ channels. The volumetric flow rate per channel, $Q_c$, is:\n$$Q_c = \\frac{Q_{\\text{tot}}}{N} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{m}^3/\\mathrm{s}}{24} = \\frac{1}{1.2 \\times 10^{6}}~\\mathrm{m}^3/\\mathrm{s} \\approx 8.333 \\times 10^{-7}~\\mathrm{m}^3/\\mathrm{s}$$\nThe cross-sectional area of a single rectangular channel, $A_c$, is:\n$$A_c = w \\times h = (1.5 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{m}) \\times (0.8 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{m}) = 1.2 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{m}^2$$\nThe mean velocity, $u_m$, in a single channel is defined as the flow rate per channel divided by the cross-sectional area:\n$$u_m = \\frac{Q_c}{A_c} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{m}^3/\\mathrm{s}}{24 \\times (1.2 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{m}^2)} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-5}}{2.88 \\times 10^{-5}}~\\mathrm{m/s} = \\frac{20}{28.8}~\\mathrm{m/s} = \\frac{25}{36}~\\mathrm{m/s} \\approx 0.694~\\mathrm{m/s}$$\n\n**2. Characteristic Length for the Channel**\nFor flow in non-circular ducts, the appropriate characteristic length is the hydraulic diameter, $D_h$. It is defined as four times the cross-sectional area divided by the wetted perimeter, $P_w$.\n$$D_h = \\frac{4 A_c}{P_w}$$\nFor a rectangular channel, the wetted perimeter is $P_w = 2(w+h)$.\n$$D_h = \\frac{4 (w h)}{2 (w+h)} = \\frac{2 w h}{w+h}$$\nSubstituting the channel dimensions:\n$$D_h = \\frac{2 (1.5 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{m}) (0.8 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{m})}{(1.5 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{m}) + (0.8 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{m})} = \\frac{2.4 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{m}^2}{2.3 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 1.043 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{m}$$\n\n**3. Reynolds Number ($\\mathrm{Re}$) and Prandtl Number ($\\mathrm{Pr}$)**\nThe Reynolds number is a dimensionless quantity that represents the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces. It is calculated using the mean velocity and hydraulic diameter.\n$$\\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{\\rho u_m D_h}{\\mu}$$\nSubstituting the known and calculated values:\n$$\\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{(1060~\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{m}^{3}) \\times (\\frac{25}{36}~\\mathrm{m/s}) \\times (\\frac{2.4 \\times 10^{-6}}{2.3 \\times 10^{-3}}~\\mathrm{m})}{2.5 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{Pa}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{1060 \\times (25/36) \\times (2.4/2.3)}{2.5} \\approx 307.246$$\nThe Prandtl number is a dimensionless quantity representing the ratio of momentum diffusivity (kinematic viscosity) to thermal diffusivity.\n$$\\mathrm{Pr} = \\frac{c_p \\mu}{k}$$\nSubstituting the fluid properties:\n$$\\mathrm{Pr} = \\frac{(3700~\\mathrm{J}/(\\mathrm{kg}\\cdot\\mathrm{K})) \\times (2.5 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{Pa}\\cdot\\mathrm{s})}{0.38~\\mathrm{W}/(\\mathrm{m}\\cdot\\mathrm{K})} = \\frac{9.25}{0.38} \\approx 24.342$$\n\n**4. Flow Regime and Boundary Layer Analysis**\nThe calculated Reynolds number is $\\mathrm{Re} \\approx 307$. For internal flow, the transition from laminar to turbulent flow is typically considered to occur at a critical Reynolds number of approximately $\\mathrm{Re}_{\\text{crit}} \\approx 2300$. Since our calculated $\\mathrm{Re}$ is substantially less than this critical value ($\\mathrm{Re} \\ll 2300$), the flow regime in each channel is definitively **laminar**.\n\nThe calculated Prandtl number is $\\mathrm{Pr} \\approx 24.3$. The ratio of the velocity boundary layer thickness, $\\delta$, to the thermal boundary layer thickness, $\\delta_T$, is related to the Prandtl number by approximately $\\delta / \\delta_T \\propto \\mathrm{Pr}^{n}$, where $n$ is a positive exponent (typically $1/3$). Since $\\mathrm{Pr} \\gg 1$, it follows that $\\delta \\gg \\delta_T$. This signifies that the **velocity boundary layer is much thicker than the thermal boundary layer**. Physically, this means that momentum diffuses into the fluid much more readily than thermal energy, which is characteristic of viscous liquids like the given ethylene glycol-water mixture.\n\nRounding the dimensionless numbers to three significant figures as required for the final answer yields:\n$\\mathrm{Re} = 307$\n$\\mathrm{Pr} = 24.3$",

            "solution": "The problem is solved in two parts as requested: first, a derivation of the total boundary heat loss, and second, the derivation and calculation of the required coolant mass flow rate.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of Total Boundary Heat Loss $Q_{\\mathrm{edge}}$\n\nWe begin from first principles, considering the heat loss from the perimeter of the cooling plate. The total heat loss, $Q_{\\mathrm{edge}}$, is the sum of the heat loss through the continuous insulation and the heat loss through the discrete mounting bolts. The problem specifies how to model these two phenomena.\n\nThe heat loss rate per unit length of the perimeter, which we denote as $q'_{\\mathrm{edge}}(s)$ where $s$ is the coordinate along the perimeter $\\Gamma$, is given by the sum of two contributions:\n1.  A continuous heat loss to the ambient at temperature $T_{\\mathrm{amb}}$ through the imperfect insulation, characterized by a lineal conductance $h_{\\ell,\\mathrm{ins}}$.\n2.  A series of concentrated heat losses to the chassis at temperature $T_{\\mathrm{ch}}$ through $N$ bolts, each modeled as a point conductance $H_b$.\n\nThe problem states to use a Dirac delta distribution, $\\delta(s)$, to represent the concentrated nature of the bolt conductance. The lineal heat loss rate can thus be formally written as:\n$$\nq'_{\\mathrm{edge}}(s) = h_{\\ell,\\mathrm{ins}} (T(s) - T_{\\mathrm{amb}}) + \\sum_{i=1}^{N} H_b (T(s_i) - T_{\\mathrm{ch}}) \\delta(s - s_i)\n$$\nHere, $T(s)$ is the temperature of the plate at position $s$ along the perimeter. A critical modeling assumption provided in the problem is that the plate temperature is nearly uniform, i.e., $T(\\mathbf{x}) \\approx \\bar{T}$. This implies that the temperature along the perimeter is also uniform, $T(s) \\approx \\bar{T}$ for all $s \\in \\Gamma$.\n\nApplying this assumption, the expression for the lineal heat loss rate simplifies to:\n$$\nq'_{\\mathrm{edge}}(s) = h_{\\ell,\\mathrm{ins}} (\\bar{T} - T_{\\mathrm{amb}}) + \\sum_{i=1}^{N} H_b (\\bar{T} - T_{\\mathrm{ch}}) \\delta(s - s_i)\n$$\nThe total boundary heat loss, $Q_{\\mathrm{edge}}$, is the integral of this lineal heat loss rate over the entire perimeter $\\Gamma$:\n$$\nQ_{\\mathrm{edge}} = \\int_{\\Gamma} q'_{\\mathrm{edge}}(s) \\, ds = \\int_{\\Gamma} \\left[ h_{\\ell,\\mathrm{ins}} (\\bar{T} - T_{\\mathrm{amb}}) + \\sum_{i=1}^{N} H_b (\\bar{T} - T_{\\mathrm{ch}}) \\delta(s - s_i) \\right] ds\n$$\nWe can evaluate the integral of each term separately:\n$$\nQ_{\\mathrm{edge}} = \\int_{\\Gamma} h_{\\ell,\\mathrm{ins}} (\\bar{T} - T_{\\mathrm{amb}}) \\, ds + \\int_{\\Gamma} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} H_b (\\bar{T} - T_{\\mathrm{ch}}) \\delta(s - s_i) \\, ds\n$$\nThe first term is the integral of a constant over the perimeter. The length of the perimeter is $P = 2(L+W)$.\n$$\n\\int_{\\Gamma} h_{\\ell,\\mathrm{ins}} (\\bar{T} - T_{\\mathrm{amb}}) \\, ds = h_{\\ell,\\mathrm{ins}} (\\bar{T} - T_{\\mathrm{amb}}) \\int_{\\Gamma} ds = h_{\\ell,\\mathrm{ins}} P (\\bar{T} - T_{\\mathrm{amb}})\n$$\nThe second term is an integral involving a sum of Dirac delta functions. Using the sifting property of the Dirac delta function, which states $\\int f(x) \\delta(x-x_0) \\, dx = f(x_0)$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Gamma} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} H_b (\\bar{T} - T_{\\mathrm{ch}}) \\delta(s - s_i) \\, ds = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} H_b (\\bar{T} - T_{\\mathrm{ch}}) = N H_b (\\bar{T} - T_{\\mathrm{ch}})\n$$\nCombining the two results, the expression for the total boundary heat loss $Q_{\\mathrm{edge}}$ is:\n$$\nQ_{\\mathrm{edge}} = h_{\\ell,\\mathrm{ins}} P (\\bar{T} - T_{\\mathrm{amb}}) + N H_b (\\bar{T} - T_{\\mathrm{ch}})\n$$\nThis expression represents $Q_{\\mathrm{edge}}$ as a functional of the plate temperature $\\bar{T}$ and the other system parameters, as required. An additional modeling assumption made here is that the continuous insulation loss and the discrete bolt losses are additive, representing parallel thermal pathways.\n\n### Part 2: Derivation and Calculation of Coolant Mass Flow Rate $\\dot{m}$\n\nTo find the required coolant mass flow rate $\\dot{m}$, we apply the principle of conservation of energy to the entire cooling plate as a control volume. At steady state, the rate of energy entering the control volume must equal the rate of energy leaving it.\n\nThe energy inputs and outputs are:\n-   **Energy Input ($Q_{\\mathrm{in}}$)**: Heat supplied by the battery cells, given by the uniform areal heat flux $q''$ over the plate's planform area $A = LW$.\n    $$Q_{\\mathrm{in}} = q'' A = q'' LW$$\n-   **Energy Output ($Q_{\\mathrm{out}}$)**: This consists of two components: the heat removed by the coolant, $Q_{\\mathrm{coolant}}$, and the heat lost to the surroundings from the edges, $Q_{\\mathrm{edge}}$.\n    $$Q_{\\mathrm{out}} = Q_{\\mathrm{coolant}} + Q_{\\mathrm{edge}}$$\n\nThe heat removed by the coolant is related to its mass flow rate $\\dot{m}$, specific heat capacity $c_p$, and the specified temperature rise from inlet to outlet, $\\Delta T_c$.\n$$\nQ_{\\mathrm{coolant}} = \\dot{m} c_p \\Delta T_c\n$$\nThe steady-state energy balance is $Q_{\\mathrm{in}} = Q_{\\mathrm{out}}$:\n$$\nq'' LW = \\dot{m} c_p \\Delta T_c + Q_{\\mathrm{edge}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $Q_{\\mathrm{edge}}$ derived in Part 1:\n$$\nq'' LW = \\dot{m} c_p \\Delta T_c + \\left[ h_{\\ell,\\mathrm{ins}} P (\\bar{T} - T_{\\mathrm{amb}}) + N H_b (\\bar{T} - T_{\\mathrm{ch}}) \\right]\n$$\nWe can now solve for the mass flow rate $\\dot{m}$:\n$$\n\\dot{m} c_p \\Delta T_c = q'' LW - \\left[ h_{\\ell,\\mathrm{ins}} P (\\bar{T} - T_{\\mathrm{amb}}) + N H_b (\\bar{T} - T_{\\mathrm{ch}}) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{m} = \\frac{1}{c_p \\Delta T_c} \\left[ q'' LW - \\left( h_{\\ell,\\mathrm{ins}} (2(L+W)) (\\bar{T} - T_{\\mathrm{amb}}) + N H_b (\\bar{T} - T_{\\mathrm{ch}}) \\right) \\right]\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for $\\dot{m}$.\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into the derived expressions.\n-   $L=0.80\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n-   $W=0.30\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n-   $q''=4.0\\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{W/m^2}$\n-   $N=8$\n-   $H_b=1.5\\,\\mathrm{W/K}$\n-   $h_{\\ell,\\mathrm{ins}}=2.0\\,\\mathrm{W/(m\\cdot K)}$\n-   $T_{\\mathrm{amb}}=25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\n-   $T_{\\mathrm{ch}}=25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\n-   $\\bar{T}=35^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\n-   $c_p=3.80\\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{J/(kg\\cdot K)}$\n-   $\\Delta T_c=5.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n\nFirst, calculate intermediate geometric and thermal quantities:\n-   Planform area: $A = LW = (0.80\\,\\mathrm{m})(0.30\\,\\mathrm{m}) = 0.24\\,\\mathrm{m^2}$.\n-   Perimeter: $P = 2(L+W) = 2(0.80\\,\\mathrm{m} + 0.30\\,\\mathrm{m}) = 2(1.10\\,\\mathrm{m}) = 2.20\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n-   Temperature differences (note that a difference in Celsius is equal to a difference in Kelvin):\n    -   $\\bar{T} - T_{\\mathrm{amb}} = 35^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} - 25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} = 10\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n    -   $\\bar{T} - T_{\\mathrm{ch}} = 35^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} - 25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} = 10\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nNext, calculate the total heat input and total edge heat loss:\n-   Total heat input:\n    $Q_{\\mathrm{in}} = q'' A = (4.0\\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{W/m^2}) (0.24\\,\\mathrm{m^2}) = 960\\,\\mathrm{W}$.\n-   Total edge heat loss:\n    $Q_{\\mathrm{edge}} = h_{\\ell,\\mathrm{ins}} P (\\bar{T} - T_{\\mathrm{amb}}) + N H_b (\\bar{T} - T_{\\mathrm{ch}})$\n    $Q_{\\mathrm{edge}} = (2.0\\,\\mathrm{W/(m\\cdot K)}) (2.20\\,\\mathrm{m}) (10\\,\\mathrm{K}) + (8) (1.5\\,\\mathrm{W/K}) (10\\,\\mathrm{K})$\n    $Q_{\\mathrm{edge}} = 44\\,\\mathrm{W} + 120\\,\\mathrm{W} = 164\\,\\mathrm{W}$.\n\nThe heat that must be removed by the coolant, $Q_{\\mathrm{coolant}}$, is the difference between the heat input and the edge loss:\n$Q_{\\mathrm{coolant}} = Q_{\\mathrm{in}} - Q_{\\mathrm{edge}} = 960\\,\\mathrm{W} - 164\\,\\mathrm{W} = 796\\,\\mathrm{W}$.\n\nFinally, calculate the required mass flow rate $\\dot{m}$:\n$\\dot{m} = \\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{coolant}}}{c_p \\Delta T_c} = \\frac{796\\,\\mathrm{W}}{(3.80\\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{J/(kg\\cdot K)}) (5.0\\,\\mathrm{K})}$\n$\\dot{m} = \\frac{796}{19000}\\,\\mathrm{kg/s} \\approx 0.0418947\\,\\mathrm{kg/s}$.\n\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get:\n$\\dot{m} \\approx 0.0419\\,\\mathrm{kg/s}$.",
