It is scientifically grounded in the principles of fluid mechanics and heat transfer, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively stated. All provided values are physically realistic for the specified engineering context of a battery cooling system. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe solution requires the determination of the flow regime and thermal characteristics within microchannels of a liquid cooling plate. This involves calculating the mean velocity, a characteristic length, the Reynolds number, and the Prandtl number.\n\nFirst, we must standardize all units to the International System of Units (SI). The given parameters are:\nNumber of channels, $N = 24$.\nTotal volumetric flow rate, $Q_{\\text{tot}} = 1.2~\\text{L}/\\text{min}$.\nChannel width, $w = 1.5~\\text{mm}$.\nChannel height, $h = 0.8~\\text{mm}$.\nChannel length, $L = 0.25~\\text{m}$.\nFluid density, $\\rho = 1060~\\text{kg}/\\text{m}^{3}$.\nFluid dynamic viscosity, $\\mu = 2.5 \\times 10^{-3}~\\text{Pa}\\cdot\\text{s}$.\nFluid thermal conductivity, $k = 0.38~\\text{W}/(\\text{m}\\cdot\\text{K})$.\nFluid specific heat capacity, $c_{p} = 3700~\\text{J}/(\\text{kg}\\cdot\\text{K})$.\n\nThe necessary conversions to SI units are:\n$Q_{\\text{tot}} = 1.2 \\frac{\\text{L}}{\\text{min}} \\times \\frac{10^{-3}~\\mathrm{m}^3}{1~\\text{L}} \\times \\frac{1~\\text{min}}{60~\\text{s}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{m}^3/\\mathrm{s}$.\n$w = 1.5~\\text{mm} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3}~\\text{m}$.\n$h = 0.8~\\text{mm} = 0.8 \\times 10^{-3}~\\text{m}$.\n\n**1. Mean Velocity in a Single Channel**\nThe total flow rate $Q_{\\text{tot}}$ is distributed evenly among $N$ channels. The volumetric flow rate per channel, $Q_c$, is:\n$$Q_c = \\frac{Q_{\\text{tot}}}{N} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{m}^3/\\mathrm{s}}{24} = \\frac{1}{1.2 \\times 10^{6}}~\\mathrm{m}^3/\\mathrm{s} \\approx 8.333 \\times 10^{-7}~\\mathrm{m}^3/\\mathrm{s}$$\nThe cross-sectional area of a single rectangular channel, $A_c$, is:\n$$A_c = w \\times h = (1.5 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{m}) \\times (0.8 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{m}) = 1.2 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{m}^2$$\nThe mean velocity, $u_m$, in a single channel is defined as the flow rate per channel divided by the cross-sectional area:\n$$u_m = \\frac{Q_c}{A_c} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{m}^3/\\mathrm{s}}{24 \\times (1.2 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{m}^2)} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-5}}{2.88 \\times 10^{-5}}~\\mathrm{m/s} = \\frac{20}{28.8}~\\mathrm{m/s} = \\frac{25}{36}~\\mathrm{m/s} \\approx 0.694~\\mathrm{m/s}$$\n\n**2. Characteristic Length for the Channel**\nFor flow in non-circular ducts, the appropriate characteristic length is the hydraulic diameter, $D_h$. It is defined as four times the cross-sectional area divided by the wetted perimeter, $P_w$.\n$$D_h = \\frac{4 A_c}{P_w}$$\nFor a rectangular channel, the wetted perimeter is $P_w = 2(w+h)$.\n$$D_h = \\frac{4 (w h)}{2 (w+h)} = \\frac{2 w h}{w+h}$$\nSubstituting the channel dimensions:\n$$D_h = \\frac{2 (1.5 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{m}) (0.8 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{m})}{(1.5 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{m}) + (0.8 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{m})} = \\frac{2.4 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{m}^2}{2.3 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 1.043 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{m}$$\n\n**3. Reynolds Number ($\\mathrm{Re}$) and Prandtl Number ($\\mathrm{Pr}$)**\nThe Reynolds number is a dimensionless quantity that represents the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces. It is calculated using the mean velocity and hydraulic diameter.\n$$\\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{\\rho u_m D_h}{\\mu}$$\nSubstituting the known and calculated values:\n$$\\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{(1060~\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{m}^{3}) \\times (\\frac{25}{36}~\\mathrm{m/s}) \\times (\\frac{2.4 \\times 10^{-6}}{2.3 \\times 10^{-3}}~\\mathrm{m})}{2.5 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{Pa}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{1060 \\times (25/36) \\times (2.4/2.3)}{2.5} \\approx 307.246$$\nThe Prandtl number is a dimensionless quantity representing the ratio of momentum diffusivity (kinematic viscosity) to thermal diffusivity.\n$$\\mathrm{Pr} = \\frac{c_p \\mu}{k}$$\nSubstituting the fluid properties:\n$$\\mathrm{Pr} = \\frac{(3700~\\mathrm{J}/(\\mathrm{kg}\\cdot\\mathrm{K})) \\times (2.5 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{Pa}\\cdot\\mathrm{s})}{0.38~\\mathrm{W}/(\\mathrm{m}\\cdot\\mathrm{K})} = \\frac{9.25}{0.38} \\approx 24.342$$\n\n**4. Flow Regime and Boundary Layer Analysis**\nThe calculated Reynolds number is $\\mathrm{Re} \\approx 307$. For internal flow, the transition from laminar to turbulent flow is typically considered to occur at a critical Reynolds number of approximately $\\mathrm{Re}_{\\text{crit}} \\approx 2300$. Since our calculated $\\mathrm{Re}$ is substantially less than this critical value ($\\mathrm{Re} \\ll 2300$), the flow regime in each channel is definitively **laminar**.\n\nThe calculated Prandtl number is $\\mathrm{Pr} \\approx 24.3$. The ratio of the velocity boundary layer thickness, $\\delta$, to the thermal boundary layer thickness, $\\delta_T$, is related to the Prandtl number by approximately $\\delta / \\delta_T \\propto \\mathrm{Pr}^{n}$, where $n$ is a positive exponent (typically $1/3$). Since $\\mathrm{Pr} \\gg 1$, it follows that $\\delta \\gg \\delta_T$. This signifies that the **velocity boundary layer is much thicker than the thermal boundary layer**. Physically, this means that momentum diffuses into the fluid much more readily than thermal energy, which is characteristic of viscous liquids like the given ethylene glycol-water mixture.\n\nRounding the dimensionless numbers to three significant figures as required for the final answer yields:\n$\\mathrm{Re} = 307$\n$\\mathrm{Pr} = 24.3$",

The task is to derive one-dimensional network equations from conservation of mass and conservation of momentum and then compute channel flow rates for specified manifold pressure profiles.\n\nStart from fundamental principles.

Substituting this into the force balance yields:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta p}{L_c} = \\frac{2\\tau_w}{R} $$\n\nNext, we use the constitutive relation for a Newtonian fluid, which states that shear stress $\\tau$ is proportional to the rate of strain. In cylindrical coordinates, for flow in the $z$-direction, this is $\\tau = -\\mu \\frac{du}{dr}$, where $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity and $u(r)$ is the axial velocity as a function of the radial coordinate $r$. The velocity gradient is negative, so the shear stress is positive. Therefore, at the wall ($r=R$), the shear stress is $\\tau_w = -\\mu \\left. \\frac{du}{dr} \\right|_{r=R}$.\n\nThe velocity profile for laminar, fully developed (Poiseuille) flow in a circular pipe is parabolic:\n$$ u(r) = u_{max} \\left(1 - \\frac{r^2}{R^2}\\right) $$\nwhere $u_{max}$ is the centerline velocity. To find the wall shear stress, we first find the velocity gradient:\n$$ \\frac{du}{dr} = u_{max} \\left(-\\frac{2r}{R^2}\\right) $$\nEvaluating this at the wall, $r=R$:\n$$ \\left. \\frac{du}{dr} \\right|_{r=R} = -\\frac{2u_{max}}{R} $$\nSubstituting this into the constitutive relation for $\\tau_w$:\n$$ \\tau_w = -\\mu \\left(-\\frac{2u_{max}}{R}\\right) = \\frac{2\\mu u_{max}}{R} $$\nNow we equate the two expressions for $\\tau_w$ by substituting this into the pressure gradient equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta p}{L_c} = \\frac{2}{R} \\left(\\frac{2\\mu u_{max}}{R}\\right) = \\frac{4\\mu u_{max}}{R^2} $$\nThis relates the maximum velocity $u_{max}$ to the pressure drop $\\Delta p$:\n$$ u_{max} = \\frac{\\Delta p R^2}{4\\mu L_c} $$\n\nThe volumetric flow rate $Q$ is obtained by integrating the velocity profile over the cross-sectional area of the pipe:\n$$ Q = \\int_{0}^{R} u(r) \\, 2\\pi r \\, dr = \\int_{0}^{R} u_{max} \\left(1 - \\frac{r^2}{R^2}\\right) 2\\pi r \\, dr $$\n$$ Q = 2\\pi u_{max} \\int_{0}^{R} \\left(r - \\frac{r^3}{R^2}\\right) dr = 2\\pi u_{max} \\left[ \\frac{r^2}{2} - \\frac{r^4}{4R^2} \\right]_{0}^{R} $$\n$$ Q = 2\\pi u_{max} \\left( \\frac{R^2}{2} - \\frac{R^4}{4R^2} \\right) = 2\\pi u_{max} \\left( \\frac{R^2}{4} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi R^2 u_{max}}{2} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $u_{max}$ into the equation for $Q$:\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi R^2}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\Delta p R^2}{4\\mu L_c} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi R^4 \\Delta p}{8\\mu L_c} $$\nThe problem specifies the channel diameter $d_c$, where $R = d_c/2$. Substituting this gives the final Hagen-Poiseuille equation for flow rate:\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi (d_c/2)^4 \\Delta p}{8\\mu L_c} = \\frac{\\pi d_c^4 \\Delta p}{128\\mu L_c} $$\nThis equation shows that the flow rate $Q$ is linearly proportional to the pressure drop $\\Delta p$. This relationship can be expressed as $Q = \\Delta p / R_h$, where $R_h$ is the hydraulic resistance of the channel. From the derived equation, the hydraulic resistance for a circular pipe in laminar flow is:\n$$ R_h = \\frac{128\\mu L_c}{\\pi d_c^4} $$\n\nTo solve the problem, for each channel $i$ located at axial position $x_i$, we first calculate the local pressure drop $\\Delta p_i$:\n$$ \\Delta p_i = p_s(x_i) - p_r(x_i) $$\nwhere $p_s(x)$ and $p_r(x)$ are the given pressure profiles for the supply and return manifolds, respectively. Then, we calculate the hydraulic resistance $R_{h,i}$ for channel $i$ with its specific length $L_{c,i}$ (and diameter $d_c$, which is constant across all channels in a given test case but could vary). Finally, we compute the volumetric flow rate $Q_i$:\n$$ Q_i = \\frac{\\Delta p_i}{R_{h,i}} = \\frac{p_s(x_i) - p_r(x_i)}{\\frac{128\\mu L_{c,i}}{\\pi d_c^4}} $$\nThis procedure is applied to all three test cases, using the specified fluid viscosity $\\mu$, channel dimensions $d_c$ and $L_{c,i}$, manifold pressure profiles $p_s(x)$ and $p_r(x)$, and branch locations $x_i$. The results are then aggregated and formatted as required.",
