            "problem": "A prismatic lithium-ion battery pack employs forced air cooling through parallel rectangular flow passages formed between module rows, each passage having width $w$ and height $h$, with smooth walls and constant cross-section along the streamwise direction. The engineering team needs a geometry-dependent characteristic length to be used inside Reynolds number ($\\mathrm{Re}$) and Nusselt number ($\\mathrm{Nu}$) correlations for non-circular ducts when estimating convective heat transfer and pressure drop at the pack level.\n\nStarting from conservation of linear momentum for a steady, fully developed, single-phase, incompressible flow of a Newtonian fluid with uniform wall shear stress around the wetted perimeter, formulate the force balance on a differential control volume to connect the streamwise pressure gradient to the integrated wall shear. From that balance, define the characteristic length that recovers the canonical circular-pipe form of the pressure–shear relationship, expressed in terms of the cross-sectional area and the wetted perimeter of a general duct. Then, specialize to the rectangular passage described above and compute this characteristic length as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $w$ and $h$.\n\nFinally, state the explicit physical and modeling assumptions under which employing this characteristic length inside single-phase convective heat-transfer correlations for non-circular ducts is justified in pack-level airflow and heat transfer modeling of battery systems.\n\nExpress your final answer for the characteristic length as a symbolic expression in terms of $w$ and $h$. The lengths $w$ and $h$ are measured in meters, so the characteristic length has units of meters; you do not need to assign numerical values. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of a characteristic length for a non-circular duct, its specialization for a rectangular cross-section, and a discussion of the assumptions underlying its use in convective heat transfer correlations.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the streamwise pressure gradient and the wall shear stress for a general duct. We consider a differential control volume of fluid of length $d x$ along the streamwise direction, which we denote as the $x$-axis. The duct has a constant cross-sectional area $A_c$ and a constant wetted perimeter $P_w$. The flow is assumed to be steady, incompressible, and fully developed. For fully developed flow, the velocity profile is invariant with $x$, and thus the net momentum flow out of the control volume is zero. The conservation of linear momentum in the $x$-direction reduces to a balance of forces.\n\nThe forces acting on the fluid within the control volume in the $x$-direction are:\n1.  Pressure force on the face at $x$: $F_{p,x} = p A_c$\n2.  Pressure force on the face at $x+dx$: $F_{p,x+dx} = -(p + \\frac{dp}{dx}dx) A_c$\n3.  Shear force exerted by the duct walls on the fluid: $F_{\\tau} = -\\tau_w P_w dx$, where $\\tau_w$ is the average wall shear stress acting over the wetted perimeter $P_w$ and length $dx$. The negative sign indicates that the force opposes the direction of flow.\n\nSince the flow is fully developed, there is no acceleration of the fluid within the control volume, and the sum of forces in the $x$-direction must be zero:\n$$ \\sum F_x = p A_c - \\left(p + \\frac{dp}{dx}dx\\right) A_c - \\tau_w P_w dx = 0 $$\nSimplifying this expression yields:\n$$ - \\frac{dp}{dx} dx A_c - \\tau_w P_w dx = 0 $$\nWe can rearrange the force balance to directly relate the pressure gradient to the wall shear:\n$$ - \\frac{dp}{dx} A_c = \\tau_w P_w $$\nThis equation shows that the pressure force driving the flow is exactly balanced by the frictional shear force resisting it. Rearranging for the wall shear stress gives:\n$$ \\tau_w = \\left(-\\frac{dp}{dx}\\right) \\frac{A_c}{P_w} $$\n\nNext, we seek a characteristic length, let us call it $L_c$, that allows this general relationship to take the \"canonical circular-pipe form\". For a circular pipe of diameter $D$, the cross-sectional area is $A_c = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}$ and the wetted perimeter is $P_w = \\pi D$. The geometric ratio for a circular pipe is:\n$$ \\frac{A_c}{P_w} = \\frac{\\pi D^2 / 4}{\\pi D} = \\frac{D}{4} $$\nSubstituting this into the general shear stress equation gives the specific form for a circular pipe:\n$$ \\tau_w = \\left(-\\frac{dp}{dx}\\right) \\frac{D}{4} $$\nTo recover this canonical form for a general duct, we must define a characteristic length $L_c$ such that the geometry of the general duct is represented in the same way as the diameter $D$ is for the circular pipe. We equate the geometric terms:\n$$ \\frac{L_c}{4} = \\frac{A_c}{P_w} $$\nSolving for $L_c$ gives the definition of the characteristic length, which is known as the hydraulic diameter, denoted $D_h$:\n$$ L_c = D_h = 4 \\frac{A_c}{P_w} $$\nBy using this definition, the pressure-shear relationship for any duct, $\\tau_w = (-\\frac{dp}{dx}) \\frac{A_c}{P_w}$, can be rewritten as $\\tau_w = (-\\frac{dp}{dx}) \\frac{D_h}{4}$, which is formally identical to the expression for a circular pipe with diameter $D$ replaced by the hydraulic diameter $D_h$. This allows the use of correlations for friction factor ($\\mathrm{Re}$) and heat transfer ($\\mathrm{Nu}$) developed for circular pipes to be applied to non-circular ducts by simply substituting $D$ with $D_h$.\n\nNow, we specialize this result for the specified rectangular passage with width $w$ and height $h$. The flow is bounded by four walls.\nThe cross-sectional area is:\n$$ A_c = w h $$\nThe wetted perimeter is the sum of the lengths of the four sides in contact with the fluid:\n$$ P_w = w + h + w + h = 2(w+h) $$\nSubstituting these expressions into the formula for the hydraulic diameter gives:\n$$ D_h = 4 \\frac{A_c}{P_w} = 4 \\frac{wh}{2(w+h)} = \\frac{2wh}{w+h} $$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression for the characteristic length.\n\nFinally, we must state the physical and modeling assumptions under which employing this characteristic length, the hydraulic diameter $D_h$, is justified for single-phase convective heat-transfer correlations (e.g., for the Nusselt number, $\\mathrm{Nu}$) in the context of pack-level battery modeling. The use of $D_h$ in heat transfer is an extension of the Reynolds analogy, which relates momentum transfer and heat transfer. The validity of this extension rests on several key assumptions:\n\n1.  **Fully Developed Flow and Thermal Profiles**: The derivation is for hydrodynamically fully developed flow. For heat transfer correlations, it is also assumed that the thermal profile is fully developed. This implies that the shape of the dimensionless temperature profile is constant in the streamwise direction, a condition approached far downstream from the duct entrance under specific thermal boundary conditions.\n\n2.  **Turbulent Flow Regime**: The hydraulic diameter concept is most accurate for turbulent flow. In turbulent flow, intense mixing in the core region makes the velocity and temperature profiles flatter and concentrates the gradients in the sublayers near the walls. This diminishes the geometric effects of the non-circular shape, making the average shear stress and heat flux more uniform around the perimeter compared to laminar flow. For laminar flow, both the friction factor and the Nusselt number are strong functions of the duct's aspect ratio, and the simple hydraulic diameter analogy is often inaccurate.\n\n3.  **Uniform Thermal Boundary Condition**: Standard heat transfer correlations using $D_h$ are typically based on the assumption of a uniform thermal boundary condition around the entire wetted perimeter, i.e., either uniform wall temperature (UWT) or uniform wall heat flux (UHF). This is a critical and often invalid assumption for battery pack modeling. In reality, heat is generated within the battery cells, meaning only a portion of the wetted perimeter (the surfaces of the battery modules) is heated. Other parts of the perimeter may be adjacent to spacers or insulators and are effectively adiabatic. This non-uniform heating can lead to significant deviations from the predictions of standard correlations.\n\n4.  **Prandtl Number near Unity**: The theoretical analogy between momentum and heat transfer (Reynolds analogy) is exact only for a Prandtl number, $Pr = \\frac{\\nu}{\\alpha}$, equal to $1$. For air, $Pr \\approx 0.7$, which is generally considered close enough for many engineering applications, but deviations from unity will introduce some error.\n\n5.  **Small to Moderate Aspect Ratio**: The accuracy of the hydraulic diameter approximation can decrease for ducts with extreme aspect ratios (e.g., $w \\gg h$ or $h \\gg w$), even in turbulent flow. Specialized correlations are often required for such geometries.\n\nIn summary, the hydraulic diameter provides a useful first-order approximation for pack-level modeling, particularly in turbulent flow, but its application to heat transfer must be done with caution, primarily due to the ubiquitous presence of non-uniform thermal boundary conditions in battery systems.",

            "introduction": "The ultimate goal of cooling is to manage the internal temperature of the battery cells. A critical decision in pack-level simulation is whether to model each cell with a single, uniform temperature (a lumped-capacitance model) or to resolve internal temperature gradients.

            "problem": "A rectangular prismatic lithium-ion cell in an air-cooled battery pack is modeled as a homogeneous solid of thermal conductivity $k$ and density $\\rho$, with only its two large faces directly exposed to forced airflow. Air at temperature $T_{\\infty}$ flows uniformly across those faces, producing a spatially uniform convective heat transfer coefficient $h$.

A lumped-capacitance model, which assumes a uniform internal temperature, is a valid approximation when the resistance to heat conduction within the body is much smaller than the resistance to heat convection from the surface of the body to the surroundings.\n\n1.  **External Convection Resistance ($R_{conv}$)**: Heat is transferred from a surface of area $A_s$ to the surrounding fluid according to Newton's law of cooling: $q_{conv} = h A_s (T_s - T_{\\infty})$. The convection resistance is therefore:\n    $$R_{conv} = \\frac{1}{h A_s}$$\n    For this problem, with symmetrical cooling from the two large faces ($A_s = L \\times W$), the convection resistance associated with one face is $R_{conv} = \\frac{1}{h (L W)}$.\n\n2.  **Internal Conduction Resistance ($R_{cond}$)**: Given that heat transfer is primarily one-dimensional through the cell's thickness ($t$), the heat path for conduction from the cell's central plane to the surface is $\\Delta x = t/2$. The area normal to this heat flow is $A_c = L \\times W$.
