            "problem": "A prismatic lithium-ion battery cell is analyzed along its through-plane direction as a one-dimensional slab of half-thickness, representing symmetry about the mid-plane. The slab occupies $x \\in [0, L]$, where $x = 0$ is the symmetry plane inside the cell and $x = L$ is the cooled exterior surface in contact with a coolant channel. Based on a prior Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis of the coolant flow, the cooled surface at $x=L$ is modeled by a convective boundary condition with heat transfer coefficient $h$ to a coolant at bulk temperature $T_{\\infty}$. Within the cell, volumetric heat generation $\\dot{q}$ arises from electrochemical and ohmic sources and is assumed spatially uniform. The solid has constant thermal conductivity $k$, and steady-state conditions prevail.\n\nStarting from first principles of energy conservation in a solid, Fourier’s law of heat conduction, and Newton’s law of cooling, derive the steady-state temperature distribution $T(x)$ for $x \\in [0, L]$ subject to symmetry at $x=0$ and convection at $x=L$.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is formally validated and found to be a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in one-dimensional heat transfer. It is self-contained, with consistent physical parameters and boundary conditions, allowing for the derivation of a unique and meaningful solution.\n\nWe begin from the first principles of energy conservation. For a one-dimensional solid at steady state, with constant thermal conductivity $k$ and uniform volumetric heat generation $\\dot{q}$, an energy balance on a differential control volume leads to the heat diffusion equation:\n$$ k\\frac{d^2T}{dx^2} + \\dot{q} = 0 $$\nwhere $T(x)$ is the temperature as a function of the spatial coordinate $x$. This second-order ordinary differential equation can be rearranged as:\n$$ \\frac{d^2T}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\dot{q}}{k} $$\nTo solve for $T(x)$, two boundary conditions are required. The first condition is at the cell's mid-plane, $x=0$, which is described as a plane of symmetry. In heat transfer, a symmetry plane is an adiabatic surface, meaning there is no heat flux across it. Mathematically, this is a zero-gradient (Neumann) boundary condition:\n$$ \\text{BC1: } \\frac{dT}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0} = 0 $$\nThe second boundary condition is at the cooled outer surface, $x=L$. Heat is conducted to this surface from the interior and then transferred to the coolant via convection. The rate of heat conduction must equal the rate of heat convection. This is expressed by equating Fourier's law of conduction and Newton's law of cooling, which yields a convective (Robin) boundary condition:\n$$ \\text{BC2: } -k\\frac{dT}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=L} = h[T(L) - T_{\\infty}] $$\nwhere $h$ is the heat transfer coefficient and $T_{\\infty}$ is the bulk coolant temperature.\n\nWe proceed by integrating the governing differential equation twice. The first integration with respect to $x$ gives the temperature gradient:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dx} = -\\frac{\\dot{q}}{k}x + C_1 $$\nThe integration constant $C_1$ is determined by applying the first boundary condition at $x=0$:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0} = -\\frac{\\dot{q}}{k}(0) + C_1 = 0 \\implies C_1 = 0 $$\nTherefore, the temperature gradient profile is:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dx} = -\\frac{\\dot{q}}{k}x $$\nThis result shows that the temperature gradient is zero at the center and becomes increasingly negative as $x$ increases, indicating that heat flows from the center towards the outer surface.\n\nIntegrating a second time yields the general form of the temperature distribution:\n$$ T(x) = \\int \\left(-\\frac{\\dot{q}}{k}x\\right) dx = -\\frac{\\dot{q}}{2k}x^2 + C_2 $$\nThe second integration constant, $C_2$, is found by applying the boundary condition at $x=L$. We evaluate $T(L)$ and $\\frac{dT}{dx}\\big|_{x=L}$ from our derived expressions:\n$$ T(L) = -\\frac{\\dot{q}}{2k}L^2 + C_2 $$\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=L} = -\\frac{\\dot{q}}{k}L $$\nSubstituting these into the BC2 equation:\n$$ -k\\left(-\\frac{\\dot{q}}{k}L\\right) = h\\left[\\left(-\\frac{\\dot{q}}{2k}L^2 + C_2\\right) - T_{\\infty}\\right] $$\n$$ \\dot{q}L = h\\left(-\\frac{\\dot{q}}{2k}L^2 + C_2 - T_{\\infty}\\right) $$\nWe now solve for $C_2$:\n$$ \\frac{\\dot{q}L}{h} = -\\frac{\\dot{q}L^2}{2k} + C_2 - T_{\\infty} $$\n$$ C_2 = T_{\\infty} + \\frac{\\dot{q}L}{h} + \\frac{\\dot{q}L^2}{2k} $$\nThe constant $C_2$ represents the maximum temperature, which occurs at the center of the slab, $T(0)$.\n\nBy substituting the expression for $C_2$ back into the equation for $T(x)$, we obtain the final symbolic solution for the temperature distribution:\n$$ T(x) = \\left(T_{\\infty} + \\frac{\\dot{q}L}{h} + \\frac{\\dot{q}L^2}{2k}\\right) - \\frac{\\dot{q}}{2k}x^2 $$\nThis equation can be usefully rewritten as:\n$$ T(x) = T_{\\infty} + \\frac{\\dot{q}L}{h} + \\frac{\\dot{q}}{2k}(L^2 - x^2) $$\n\nNext, we substitute the provided numerical parameters to obtain the specific expression for $T(x)$:\n- $L = 0.005~\\mathrm{m}$\n- $k = 0.8~\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n- $\\dot{q} = 1.2 \\times 10^{5}~\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-3}}$\n- $h = 250~\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}}$\n- $T_{\\infty} = 298~\\mathrm{K}$\n\nThe temperature profile takes the quadratic form $T(x) = T(0) - Bx^2$.

            "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation against the established criteria.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Governing Equation**: The one-dimensional transient energy equation for a homogeneous isotropic solid with uniform volumetric heat generation is given as:\n  $$ \\rho c_p \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\\right) + \\dot{q}(t) $$\n  where $\\rho$ is density, $c_p$ is specific heat capacity, $k$ is thermal conductivity, $T(x,t)$ is temperature, and $\\dot{q}(t)$ is the volumetric heat generation rate.\n- **Domain**: A one-dimensional slab of thickness $L$ along the coordinate $x \\in [0,L]$.\n- **Discretization**: The domain is discretized uniformly into $N$ control volumes of width $\\Delta x = L / N$. The time domain is discretized with a constant time step $\\Delta t$ using a fully implicit (backward Euler) scheme.\n- **Heat Generation**: The uniform volumetric heat generation is:\n  $$ \\dot{q}(t) = \\frac{I(t)^2 R(T)}{V} $$\n  where $V = L A_{\\mathrm{cs}}$, $A_{\\mathrm{cs}}$ is the cross-sectional area, and $I(t)$ is the prescribed current.\n- **Internal Resistance**: The temperature-dependent internal resistance $R(T)$ is modeled as:\n  $$ R(T) = R_0 \\left(1 + \\alpha \\left(\\bar{T} - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right)\\right) $$\n  where $R_0$ is the reference resistance at temperature $T_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, $\\alpha$ is the linear temperature coefficient, and $\\bar{T}$ is the instantaneous spatial average temperature. For numerical solution, $R(T)$ is evaluated using the spatial average temperature from the previous time step.\n- **Boundary Conditions**: Robin boundary conditions are applied at both faces, $x=0$ and $x=L$:\n  $$ -k \\left.\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\\right|_{x=0} = h \\left(T(0,t) - T_{\\infty}\\right) $$\n  $$ -k \\left.\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\\right|_{x=L} = h \\left(T(L,t) - T_{\\infty}\\right) $$\n  where $h$ is the convective heat transfer coefficient and $T_{\\infty}$ is the coolant temperature.\n- **Initial Condition**: The temperature is uniform at $t=0$: $T(x,0) = T_0$.\n- **Finite-Volume Formulation Guidelines**:\n    - Interior control volumes: Conductive fluxes are $k A_{\\mathrm{cs}} (T_{\\mathrm{W}} - T_{\\mathrm{P}})/\\delta$ and $k A_{\\mathrm{cs}} (T_{\\mathrm{E}} - T_{\\mathrm{P}})/\\delta$ with $\\delta = \\Delta x$.\n    - Boundary control volumes: Convective boundary conditions are incorporated as a sink term with coefficient $h A_{\\mathrm{cs}}$ and a source term $h A_{\\mathrm{cs}} T_{\\infty}$.\n- **Required Outputs**:\n    1.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, self-contained, and directly pertinent to the specified field. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe solution requires discretizing the governing partial differential equation using the finite-volume method and solving the resulting system of algebraic equations at each time step.\n\n**1. Finite-Volume Discretization**\nWe use a cell-centered grid with $N$ control volumes (CVs), indexed $i=0, \\dots, N-1$. Each CV has a width of $\\Delta x = L/N$. The node $P_i$ is at the center of the $i$-th CV. The temperature at node $P_i$ at time step $n$ is denoted by $T_i^n$.\n\nThe governing equation is integrated over a control volume $V_P = A_{\\mathrm{cs}}\\Delta x$ and a time interval from $t^n$ to $t^{n+1}$. Using a fully implicit scheme, we obtain:\n$$ \\rho c_p \\frac{T_P^{n+1} - T_P^n}{\\Delta t} (A_{\\mathrm{cs}}\\Delta x) = \\left. \\left( k A_{\\mathrm{cs}} \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} \\right) \\right|_e - \\left. \\left( k A_{\\mathrm{cs}} \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} \\right) \\right|_w + \\dot{q}^{n+1} (A_{\\mathrm{cs}}\\Delta x) $$\nwhere the superscripts $n$ and $n+1$ denote the previous and current time levels, respectively. The subscripts $w$ and $e$ refer to the west and east faces of the control volume. The heat generation term $\\dot{q}^{n+1}$ is evaluated using the current $I(t^{n+1})$ and the resistance $R(\\bar{T}^n)$ calculated from the previous time step's average temperature $\\bar{T}^n$.\n\n**2. Discretized Equations**\n\n**Interior Control Volume ($i = 1, \\dots, N-2$)**:\nFor an interior CV, the fluxes at the west and east faces are diffusive. The discretized equation for node $i$ is:\n$$ \\rho c_p \\frac{T_i^{n+1} - T_i^n}{\\Delta t} A_{\\mathrm{cs}}\\Delta x = k A_{\\mathrm{cs}} \\frac{T_{i+1}^{n+1} - T_i^{n+1}}{\\Delta x} + k A_{\\mathrm{cs}} \\frac{T_{i-1}^{n+1} - T_i^{n+1}}{\\Delta x} + \\dot{q}^{n+1} A_{\\mathrm{cs}}\\Delta x $$\nRearranging to group terms for the unknown temperature $T^{n+1}$ gives the algebraic equation:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\rho c_p \\Delta x}{\\Delta t} + \\frac{2k}{\\Delta x} \\right)T_i^{n+1} - \\frac{k}{\\Delta x} T_{i-1}^{n+1} - \\frac{k}{\\Delta x} T_{i+1}^{n+1} = \\frac{\\rho c_p \\Delta x}{\\Delta t} T_i^n + \\dot{q}^{n+1} \\Delta x $$\n\n**Boundary Control Volume at $x=0$ ($i=0$)**:\nThe west face of this CV is the physical boundary at $x=0$. The heat loss is due to convection, $q_{conv} = h A_{\\mathrm{cs}}(T(0,t) - T_{\\infty})$. Following the problem's instruction, this is treated as a source term. The flux through the west face is incorporated as $S = S_u + S_p T_0^{n+1}$, where $S_u = h A_{\\mathrm{cs}} T_{\\infty}$ and $S_p = -h A_{\\mathrm{cs}}$. The energy balance becomes:\n$$ \\rho c_p \\frac{T_0^{n+1} - T_0^n}{\\Delta t} A_{\\mathrm{cs}}\\Delta x = k A_{\\mathrm{cs}} \\frac{T_1^{n+1} - T_0^{n+1}}{\\Delta x} + (\\dot{q}^{n+1} A_{\\mathrm{cs}}\\Delta x + hA_{\\mathrm{cs}}T_{\\infty} - hA_{\\mathrm{cs}}T_0^{n+1}) $$\nRearranging gives:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\rho c_p \\Delta x}{\\Delta t} + \\frac{k}{\\Delta x} + h \\right) T_0^{n+1} - \\frac{k}{\\Delta x} T_1^{n+1} = \\frac{\\rho c_p \\Delta x}{\\Delta t} T_0^n + \\dot{q}^{n+1} \\Delta x + h T_{\\infty} $$\n\n**Boundary Control Volume at $x=L$ ($i=N-1$)**:\nSymmetrically, for the CV at the east boundary, the convective heat loss is incorporated as a source term. The energy balance is:\n$$ \\rho c_p \\frac{T_{N-1}^{n+1} - T_{N-1}^n}{\\Delta t} A_{\\mathrm{cs}}\\Delta x = k A_{\\mathrm{cs}} \\frac{T_{N-2}^{n+1} - T_{N-1}^{n+1}}{\\Delta x} + (\\dot{q}^{n+1} A_{\\mathrm{cs}}\\Delta x + hA_{\\mathrm{cs}}T_{\\infty} - hA_{\\mathrm{cs}}T_{N-1}^{n+1}) $$\nRearranging gives:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\rho c_p \\Delta x}{\\Delta t} + \\frac{k}{\\Delta x} + h \\right) T_{N-1}^{n+1} - \\frac{k}{\\Delta x} T_{N-2}^{n+1} = \\frac{\\rho c_p \\Delta x}{\\Delta t} T_{N-1}^n + \\dot{q}^{n+1} \\Delta x + h T_{\\infty} $$\n\n**3. Linear System and Solution**\nThe set of $N$ linear algebraic equations forms a tridiagonal system $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{T}^{n+1} = \\mathbf{b}$, where $\\mathbf{T}^{n+1}$ is the vector of unknown temperatures $[T_0^{n+1}, T_1^{n+1}, \\dots, T_{N-1}^{n+1}]^T$. The matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ and vector $\\mathbf{b}$ are constructed as follows:\n\nLet $C_{trans} = \\frac{\\rho c_p \\Delta x}{\\Delta t}$ and $C_{cond} = \\frac{k}{\\Delta x}$.\n\nThe non-zero entries of matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ are:\n- Main diagonal ($d_i$):\n  - $d_0 = d_{N-1} = C_{trans} + C_{cond} + h$\n  - $d_i = C_{trans} + 2C_{cond}$ for $i=1, \\dots, N-2$\n- Lower diagonal ($l_i$):\n  - $l_i = -C_{cond}$ for $i=1, \\dots, N-1$\n- Upper diagonal ($u_i$):\n  - $u_i = -C_{cond}$ for $i=0, \\dots, N-2$\n\nThe right-hand side vector $\\mathbf{b}$ has elements:\n- $b_0 = C_{trans} T_0^n + \\dot{q}^{n+1}\\Delta x + h T_{\\infty}$\n- $b_i = C_{trans} T_i^n + \\dot{q}^{n+1}\\Delta x$ for $i=1, \\dots, N-2$\n- $b_{N-1} = C_{trans} T_{N-1}^n + \\dot{q}^{n+1}\\Delta x + h T_{\\infty}$\n\nSince the matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is constant for the entire simulation, it needs to be assembled only once. At each time step, the vector $\\mathbf{b}$ is updated, and the system is solved for $\\mathbf{T}^{n+1}$ using an efficient tridiagonal solver, such as the Thomas algorithm, available in `scipy.linalg.solve_banded`.\n\n**4. Algorithmic Procedure**\nFor each test case:\n1.  Initialize parameters, compute $\\Delta x$, and set the initial temperature field $T^0_i = T_0$ for all $i$.\n2.  Initialize `peak_temp = T_0` and a list to store spatially averaged temperatures at each time step.\n3.  Assemble the constant tridiagonal matrix $\\mathbf{A}$.\n4.  Iterate through time steps from $n=0$ to $N_{steps}-1$:\n    a. Determine the current $I(t^{n+1})$ from the drive cycle profile.\n    b. Compute the spatial average temperature from the previous step: $\\bar{T}^n = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} T_i^n$.\n    c. Calculate the heat generation rate: $\\dot{q}^{n+1} = \\frac{I(t^{n+1})^2 R_0(1+\\alpha(\\bar{T}^n - T_{ref}))}{L A_{cs}}$.\n    d. Assemble the right-hand side vector $\\mathbf{b}$ using $T^n$ and $\\dot{q}^{n+1}$.\n    e. Solve the system $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{T}^{n+1} = \\mathbf{b}$ for $\\mathbf{T}^{n+1}$.\n    f. Update the peak temperature: `peak_temp = max(peak_temp, max(T^{n+1}))`.\n    g. Compute the new spatial average temperature $\\bar{T}^{n+1}$ and store it.\n    h. Update the temperature field for the next iteration: $T^n \\leftarrow T^{n+1}$.\n5.  After the loop, calculate the time-averaged spatially averaged temperature as the arithmetic mean of all stored $\\bar{T}$ values from $t_1$ to $t_{final}$.\n6.
