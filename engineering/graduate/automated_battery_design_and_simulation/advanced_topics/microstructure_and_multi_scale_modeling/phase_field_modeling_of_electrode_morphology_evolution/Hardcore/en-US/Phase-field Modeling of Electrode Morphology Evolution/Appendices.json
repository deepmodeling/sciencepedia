            "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional electrolyte layer occupying the spatial domain $x \\in [0, L]$, where $L  0$ is the layer thickness. The electrolyte contains an electroactive cation with valence $z  0$, concentration field $c(x)$, and constant tracer diffusion coefficient $D  0$. The temperature is uniform and constant. The electrode at $x=0$ consumes the cation via a fast interfacial reduction reaction, and the distant reservoir at $x=L$ maintains a fixed concentration $c_L$. The interfacial concentration at $x=0$ is $c_0$, imposed by fast reaction kinetics and strong coupling to the evolving electrode morphology described by a phase-field model.\n\nAssume (i) isothermal conditions, (ii) no convection, (iii) a very high concentration of inert supporting salt that suppresses migration so that transport of the electroactive cation is governed by diffusion alone, and (iv) bulk electroneutrality holds so that the electric potential gradient is negligible in the transport of the electroactive species. Under steady state, the cation molar flux is uniform in space. The electrical current density associated with cation consumption at the electrode is defined as positive when the net ionic charge transfer is from the electrolyte into the electrode at $x=0$.\n\nStarting from first principles—mass conservation and Fick’s first law for diffusion—derive the steady-state diffusion-limited electrical current density at the electrode, expressed in terms of $z$, the Faraday constant $F$, the diffusion coefficient $D$, the layer thickness $L$, and the imposed boundary concentrations $c_0$ and $c_L$.

            "solution": "The problem is evaluated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It represents a standard, formalizable problem in electrochemical transport phenomena. All required information is provided, and the premises are consistent with established physical principles. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe derivation of the steady-state diffusion-limited electrical current density begins from first principles: mass conservation and a constitutive law for mass flux.\n\n1.  **Mass Conservation in One Dimension**\n    The continuity equation for a species with concentration $c(x, t)$ and molar flux $J(x, t)$ in one dimension is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x}\n    $$\n    This equation assumes there are no homogeneous chemical reactions in the bulk of the electrolyte. The problem states that the system is at steady state, which means that all time derivatives are zero. Therefore, $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = 0$. The continuity equation simplifies to:\n    $$\n    \\frac{dJ}{dx} = 0\n    $$\n    This implies that the molar flux $J$ is constant throughout the electrolyte layer, i.e., $J(x) = J_{ss}$, where $J_{ss}$ is a constant representing the steady-state flux.\n\n2.  **Constitutive Law for Molar Flux (Fick's First Law)**\n    The problem specifies several assumptions: isothermal conditions, no convection, and a high concentration of supporting electrolyte. The athermal assumption means material properties like the diffusion coefficient $D$ are constant. The absence of convection means the flux is due only to diffusion and migration. The high concentration of supporting salt effectively screens the electric field, meaning the transport number of the electroactive cation is close to zero. Consequently, the effect of the electric field on the cation's motion (migration) is negligible. The transport is thus governed purely by diffusion.\n\n    Fick's first law of diffusion in one dimension relates the molar flux $J$ to the concentration gradient $\\frac{dc}{dx}$:\n    $$\n    J(x) = -D \\frac{dc}{dx}\n    $$\n    where $D$ is the constant diffusion coefficient.\n\n3.  **Solving for the Concentration Profile and Flux**\n    Combining the results from mass conservation ($J(x) = J_{ss}$) and Fick's law, we obtain a first-order ordinary differential equation for the concentration $c(x)$:\n    $$\n    J_{ss} = -D \\frac{dc}{dx}\n    $$\n    This equation can be solved by separation of variables:\n    $$\n    dc = -\\frac{J_{ss}}{D} dx\n    $$\n    We integrate this equation across the domain from the electrode interface at $x=0$ to the reservoir boundary at $x=L$. The corresponding concentrations are $c(0) = c_0$ and $c(L) = c_L$, respectively.\n    $$\n    \\int_{c(0)}^{c(L)} dc' = \\int_{0}^{L} -\\frac{J_{ss}}{D} dx'\n    $$\n    $$\n    c(L) - c(0) = -\\frac{J_{ss}}{D} (L - 0)\n    $$\n    Substituting the given boundary concentrations:\n    $$\n    c_L - c_0 = -\\frac{J_{ss} L}{D}\n    $$\n    Now, we solve for the steady-state molar flux, $J_{ss}$:\n    $$\n    J_{ss} = -\\frac{D(c_L - c_0)}{L} = \\frac{D(c_0 - c_L)}{L}\n    $$\n    This expression gives the molar flux of the cation in the positive $x$-direction (from the electrode towards the reservoir).\n\n4.  **Relating Molar Flux to Electrical Current Density**\n    The electrical current density, denoted by $i$, is the rate of charge transfer per unit area. The charge is carried by the electroactive cations. Each mole of cations has a valence $z$ and thus carries a total charge of $zF$, where $F$ is the Faraday constant.\n\n    The problem defines the current density $i$ as positive for a net ionic charge transfer *from* the electrolyte *into* the electrode at $x=0$.\n    The electrode is at $x=0$ and the electrolyte is in the domain $x0$. Therefore, a transfer of positive cations into the electrode corresponds to a flux in the negative $x$-direction.\n\n    The calculated flux $J_{ss}$ is the component of the flux vector in the positive $x$-direction. A flux of cations in the negative $x$-direction is described by a negative value of $J_{ss}$. The current density $i$ is related to the molar flux $J_{ss}$ by:\n    $$\n    i = -z F J_{ss}\n    $$\n    The negative sign is crucial: a positive current (charge flow into the electrode, in the $-x$ direction) requires a molar flux $J_{ss}$ that is negative.\n\n    Substituting the expression for $J_{ss}$ into the equation for $i$:\n    $$\n    i = -zF \\left( \\frac{D(c_0 - c_L)}{L} \\right)\n    $$\n    Simplifying this expression yields the final result for the steady-state diffusion-limited current density:\n    $$\n    i = \\frac{zFD(c_L - c_0)}{L}\n    $$\n    This result shows that consumption at the electrode (typically $c_0  c_L$) leads to a positive current density $i  0$, which is consistent with the problem's sign convention for a reduction reaction.",
