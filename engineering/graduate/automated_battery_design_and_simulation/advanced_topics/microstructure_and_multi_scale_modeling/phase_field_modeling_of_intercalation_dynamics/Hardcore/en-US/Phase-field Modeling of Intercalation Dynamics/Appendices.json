Round the final numerical answer to three significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated based on the established criteria.\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is firmly rooted in the standard theoretical framework of transport phenomena and materials science, specifically the modeling of electrochemical systems like batteries.

The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe process of lithium intercalation into the electrode particle involves two sequential steps: ($1$) an interfacial reaction at the surface ($x=0$) where lithium transfers into the solid phase, and ($2$) bulk diffusion of lithium from the surface into the interior of the particle. The overall rate of the intercalation process is governed by the slower of these two steps. To distinguish between the regimes, we define a characteristic timescale for each process.\n\n**1. Characteristic Timescales**\n\n**Characteristic Diffusion Time ($\\tau_D$):**\nThe transport of lithium within the particle is governed by the diffusion equation, which in one dimension is $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2}$. We can estimate the characteristic time it takes for a concentration change to propagate across the entire particle thickness $L$ by dimensional analysis. Replacing the derivatives with characteristic scales ($\\partial t \\sim \\tau_D$, $\\partial x \\sim L$), the equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta c}{\\tau_D} \\sim D \\frac{\\Delta c}{L^2}\n$$\nSolving for the diffusion timescale, $\\tau_D$, we get:\n$$\n\\tau_D = \\frac{L^2}{D}\n$$\nThis is the characteristic time required for lithium to diffuse across the particle.\n\n**Characteristic Reaction Time ($\\tau_R$):**\nThe interfacial reaction is described by the flux condition at the boundary, $J_R = k(c_s - c^*) = k \\Delta c_{surf}$. This flux represents the rate at which lithium enters the particle per unit area. To find a characteristic time, we consider how long it would take for this surface reaction to fill the entire particle volume (per unit area) of thickness $L$. The rate of change of the average concentration, $\\bar{c}$, within the particle due to this influx is given by $L \\frac{d\\bar{c}}{dt} = J_R$. Using characteristic scales, this becomes:\n$$\nL \\frac{\\Delta c}{\\tau_R} \\sim k \\Delta c\n$$\nSolving for the reaction timescale, $\\tau_R$, gives:\n$$\n\\tau_R = \\frac{L}{k}\n$$\nThis is the characteristic time associated with the interfacial transfer process.\n\n**2. Reaction-Limited vs. Diffusion-Limited Regimes**\n\nThe physical distinction between the two limiting regimes is determined by the ratio of these two timescales.\n\n- **Reaction-Limited Regime:** This occurs when the interfacial reaction is the bottleneck. This means the reaction is much slower than diffusion, so the characteristic time for reaction is much greater than for diffusion: $\\tau_R \\gg \\tau_D$. In this case, any lithium that successfully enters the particle via reaction can diffuse away into the bulk almost instantaneously. As a result, the concentration profile inside the particle remains nearly uniform, and the overall rate of intercalation is dictated by the kinetic rate constant $k$.\n\n- **Diffusion-Limited Regime:** This occurs when bulk diffusion is the bottleneck. This means diffusion is much slower than the reaction: $\\tau_D \\gg \\tau_R$. The interfacial reaction is so fast that lithium rapidly enters the surface, but its transport into the particle interior is sluggish. This leads to a buildup of lithium concentration near the surface ($x=0$) and the formation of a steep concentration gradient. The overall rate of intercalation is limited by the diffusive transport coefficient $D$.\n\n**3. Derivation of the Damköhler Number ($Da$)**\n\nThe Damköhler number is a dimensionless quantity that compares the characteristic rate of reaction to the characteristic rate of transport. By convention in this context, it is defined as the ratio of the characteristic diffusion time to the characteristic reaction time.\n$$\nDa = \\frac{\\text{characteristic transport timescale}}{\\text{characteristic reaction timescale}} = \\frac{\\tau_D}{\\tau_R}\n$$\nA large Damköhler number ($Da \\gg 1$) implies that the diffusion time is much longer than the reaction time, corresponding to the diffusion-limited regime. A small Damköhler number ($Da \\ll 1$) implies that the reaction time is much longer, corresponding to the reaction-limited regime.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\tau_D$ and $\\tau_R$:\n$$\nDa = \\frac{L^2 / D}{L / k}\n$$\nSimplifying this expression yields the Damköhler number for this system:\n$$\nDa = \\frac{kL}{D}\n$$\n\n**4. Calculation of the Damköhler Number**\n\nThe problem provides the following numerical values:\n- $L = 4.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}$\n- $D = 2.5 \\times 10^{-14} \\, \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}$\n- $k = 5.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{m}/\\text{s}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula for the Damköhler number:\n$$\nDa = \\frac{(5.0 \\times 10^{-9}) (4.0 \\times 10^{-6})}{2.5 \\times 10^{-14}}\n$$\nFirst, we compute the numerator:\n$$\n(5.0 \\times 10^{-9}) \\times (4.0 \\times 10^{-6}) = 20.0 \\times 10^{-15} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-14}\n$$\nNow, we perform the division:\n$$\nDa = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-14}}{2.5 \\times 10^{-14}} = \\frac{2.0}{2.5} = 0.8\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nDa = 0.800\n$$\nSince $Da$ is close to $1$, this value indicates that the system operates in a mixed-control regime, where the rates of reaction and diffusion are comparable.",

The physically relevant modes for instability are those with $n \\ge 1$.\n\nPseudo-solid-solution behavior occurs if and only if all admissible modes are stable, meaning $\\omega(k_n) \\le 0$ for all $n \\ge 1$. This is equivalent to requiring $f''_{hom}(c_0) + \\kappa k_n^2 \\ge 0$ for all $n \\ge 1$. The term $\\kappa k_n^2 = \\kappa (\\frac{n\\pi}{L})^2$ is a monotonically increasing function of $n$. Therefore, the stability of the entire system is determined by the most susceptible mode, which is the one with the smallest non-zero wave number, $k_1 = \\pi/L$. If this mode is stable, all other modes with larger $n$ (and thus larger $k_n$) will also be stable.\n\nThe criterion for pseudo-solid-solution behavior is thus:\n$$\nf''_{hom}(c_0) + \\kappa k_1^2 \\ge 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad f''_{hom}(c_0) + \\kappa \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\ge 0\n$$\nTo evaluate this, we compute the second derivative of the homogeneous free energy density:\n$$\nf'_{hom}(c) = \\frac{d}{dc} \\left( \\Omega c(1-c) + c \\ln c + (1-c) \\ln(1-c) \\right) = \\Omega(1-2c) + \\ln c - \\ln(1-c)\n$$\n$$\nf''_{hom}(c) = \\frac{d^2}{dc^2} f_{hom}(c) = -2\\Omega + \\frac{1}{c} + \\frac{1}{1-c} = \\frac{1}{c(1-c)} - 2\\Omega\n$$\nThe final condition to be algorithmically tested for each parameter set $(L, c_0, \\kappa, \\Omega)$ is whether the following inequality holds:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{1}{c_0(1-c_0)} - 2\\Omega \\right) + \\kappa \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{L} \\right)^2 \\ge 0\n$$\nIf the inequality is true, the system exhibits pseudo-solid-solution behavior; otherwise, it is unstable to spinodal decomposition.",
