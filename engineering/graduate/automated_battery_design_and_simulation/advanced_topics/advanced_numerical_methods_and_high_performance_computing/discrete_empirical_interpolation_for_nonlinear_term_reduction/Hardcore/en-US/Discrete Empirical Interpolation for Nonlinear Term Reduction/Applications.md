## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

### Introduction

The preceding chapters have detailed the foundational principles and mechanisms of the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM). We have established that for [projection-based reduced-order models](@entry_id:1130226) (ROMs) of [nonlinear systems](@entry_id:168347), a standard Galerkin projection alone is insufficient for [computational efficiency](@entry_id:270255). The evaluation of the nonlinear term, even on the reduced state, requires a "lift" back to the high-dimensional state space, thereby reintroducing a computational cost that scales with the full model size, $N$. This so-called "curse of nonlinearity" negates the primary advantage of [model order reduction](@entry_id:167302) for a vast class of problems.

This chapter bridges theory and practice by exploring how DEIM and related [hyper-reduction](@entry_id:163369) techniques resolve this fundamental challenge. We will move beyond the abstract formulation to demonstrate the utility, extension, and integration of DEIM in diverse, real-world scientific and engineering disciplines. Our focus will not be on re-teaching the core algorithm, but on showcasing its role as an enabling technology for complex, many-query, and large-scale simulations that would otherwise be computationally intractable. We will begin by examining DEIM's central role in automated engineering design, then delve into a detailed case study in electrochemical systems, broaden our scope to other interdisciplinary applications, and conclude by addressing advanced theoretical considerations that are critical for its robust and physically consistent implementation.

### Accelerating Many-Query Simulations in Engineering Design

A primary driver for [model order reduction](@entry_id:167302) is the need for rapid, repeated simulations in "many-query" contexts such as design optimization, [uncertainty quantification](@entry_id:138597), [inverse problems](@entry_id:143129), and control. In an [automated battery design](@entry_id:1121262) workflow, for instance, engineers may need to evaluate thousands of candidate designs, each defined by a different parameter vector $\mu$ (e.g., electrode porosity, particle size, material conductivities). Solving the full-order, physics-based model for each candidate is computationally prohibitive.

This is where the [offline-online decomposition](@entry_id:177117), made possible by [hyper-reduction](@entry_id:163369), becomes indispensable. The strategy involves two distinct stages:

1.  **Offline Stage (Expensive, Performed Once):** A significant upfront computational investment is made to "learn" the behavior of the system. This involves running a set of high-fidelity simulations for a representative training set of parameters to generate state and nonlinear-term snapshots. From these snapshots, both the state-reduction basis (e.g., via Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, POD) and the DEIM basis for the nonlinearity are constructed. All parameter-independent reduced operators and DEIM-related matrices are precomputed and stored.

2.  **Online Stage (Fast, Performed for each Query):** For any new parameter vector $\mu$, the precomputed components are loaded. The simulation is then performed entirely in the reduced-dimensional space. Thanks to DEIM, the evaluation of the nonlinear term at each time step no longer depends on the full dimension $n$. Instead, its cost scales with the much smaller reduced basis dimension, $r$, and the number of DEIM interpolation points, $m$. For a Newton-based solver, the online cost per iteration can be shown to scale polynomially with $r$ and $m$ (e.g., as $\mathcal{O}(r^3 + r m)$), completely independent of the original dimension $n$.

This decomposition enables the rapid, batched evaluation of numerous designs and operating profiles, transforming the simulation from a forensic analysis tool into a predictive design instrument . The strategic selection of a modeling approach is itself a design choice. For systems where the solution manifold has a low-dimensional structure (i.e., a rapidly decaying Kolmogorov $n$-width), a global basis may suffice. However, for large parameter spaces or systems with bifurcations, the parameter domain may need to be partitioned, with localized bases constructed for each region. If the primary goal is high fidelity for a specific scalar output (e.g., battery lifetime), goal-oriented reduction strategies may be preferred to steer the [model reduction](@entry_id:171175) process toward accuracy in that specific quantity .

### Applications in Electrochemical Systems: The Case of Lithium-Ion Batteries

Physics-based models of [lithium-ion batteries](@entry_id:150991), such as the Pseudo-two-Dimensional (P2D) Doyle-Fuller-Newman model, are a prime application area for DEIM. These models are described by a coupled system of nonlinear partial differential equations that capture transport and reaction phenomena within the electrodes and electrolyte. The nonlinearities in these models present a significant computational bottleneck.

A critical question for the practitioner is where to apply [hyper-reduction](@entry_id:163369) for maximal computational gain. A P2D model typically involves multiple nonlinearities. For example, transport properties like electrolyte diffusivity $D_e(c_e)$ and conductivity $\kappa(c_e)$ depend nonlinearly on the local salt concentration $c_e$. These are *volumetric* nonlinearities, as they must be evaluated at every node in the discretized electrode and separator domains. In contrast, the [electrochemical reaction rate](@entry_id:264009), typically modeled by the highly nonlinear Butler-Volmer equation, is an *interfacial* nonlinearity, evaluated only at the interface between the active material particles and the electrolyte.

While the Butler-Volmer kinetics may be "more nonlinear" in a functional sense, the dominant computational cost often arises from the volumetric terms. This is a matter of scale: the cost of evaluating a nonlinear term is proportional to the number of degrees of freedom over which it is defined. In a typical discretization, the number of volumetric nodes ($N_v \approx 10^5$) can be orders of magnitude larger than the number of interfacial nodes ($N_{\Gamma} \approx 10^3$). DEIM reduces the evaluation cost of any nonlinearity from its native dimension to one proportional to the number of interpolation points, $m$. Therefore, the absolute and relative computational savings are far greater when DEIM is applied to the volumetric nonlinearities, yielding speedups of several orders of magnitude, compared to the more modest gains from approximating the already less expensive interfacial term .

The computational mechanism of DEIM is particularly elegant for component-wise nonlinearities like the Butler-Volmer equation, $j = f(\eta)$. The DEIM approximation of the full nonlinear vector $f(x)$ is given by the expression $\widehat{f}(x) = U (P^T U)^{-1} P^T f(x)$ . The key to its efficiency is that the term $P^T f(x)$ can be computed without first forming the full vector $f(x)$. Since $f$ is component-wise, evaluating the function at the $m$ selected indices is equivalent to selecting the indices and then evaluating the function. This means only $m$ evaluations of the expensive exponential terms in the Butler-Volmer equation are needed at each time step. The full $N$-dimensional approximate vector is then reconstructed via multiplication with the precomputed $N \times m$ matrix $U (P^T U)^{-1}$, an operation far cheaper than evaluating the nonlinearity everywhere .

This acceleration is a key enabler for performing large-scale, high-fidelity battery simulations in High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments. In simulations with millions of degrees of freedom running on parallel clusters, the cost of evaluating the full nonlinear residual at every time step is prohibitive. By applying DEIM, the evaluation cost for the nonlinear term is reduced by a factor proportional to $N/m$. This drastically reduces the computational workload, while the main limitations on overall speedup become the cost of the reduced-dimensional linear solves and the communication overhead for gathering the necessary information at the $m$ sample points across MPI ranks .

### Interdisciplinary Connections: DEIM Across Scientific Domains

The power of DEIM lies in its mathematical generality. While we have focused on battery models, the method is broadly applicable to any system where nonlinearities pose a computational bottleneck.

*   **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD):** In the simulation of [incompressible fluid](@entry_id:262924) flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, the quadratic convective term $(u \cdot \nabla) u$ is a key nonlinearity. For parametrized problems, ROMs are essential for exploring the design space. However, the convective term couples all velocity components, and its evaluation in a standard Galerkin-ROM framework scales with the full model size. Hyper-reduction with DEIM or related methods is necessary to achieve true online efficiency. The success of such a ROM depends on fundamental properties of the system: the solution manifold must be approximable by a low-dimensional subspace (a rapidly decaying Kolmogorov $n$-width), and the reduced discretization must be stable (e.g., satisfy a reduced basis [inf-sup condition](@entry_id:174538)) . For complex, [convection-dominated flows](@entry_id:169432), the slow decay of the Kolmogorov width can pose a fundamental challenge to any linear subspace reduction method .

*   **Geosciences and Poroelasticity:** In modeling fluid flow through [porous media](@entry_id:154591), such as in [geological carbon sequestration](@entry_id:749837) or [hydrogeology](@entry_id:750462), the material properties themselves can be nonlinear. For instance, in Biot's theory of poroelasticity, the permeability of the rock matrix can depend nonlinearly on the local strain. This introduces a [nonlinear diffusion](@entry_id:177801) term into the governing equations. DEIM can be applied to approximate this term, but as we will discuss later, standard DEIM can fail to preserve critical mathematical structures like the symmetry and [positive-definiteness](@entry_id:149643) of the [diffusion operator](@entry_id:136699), motivating the development of more advanced, structure-preserving techniques .

*   **Nuclear Reactor Physics:** Coupled neutronics and thermal-hydraulics simulations are essential for [nuclear reactor design](@entry_id:1128940) and safety analysis. A key nonlinearity arises from thermal feedback: the [neutron cross sections](@entry_id:1128688) of materials are temperature-dependent. The temperature, in turn, depends on the local power density, which is a function of the neutron flux. DEIM can be used to efficiently approximate this nonlinear feedback loop, requiring the full thermal calculation to be performed only at a small set of "hotspot" locations determined by the DEIM algorithm .

*   **Biomedical Engineering:** DEIM finds application in the modeling of biological systems. For example, in simulating blood flow in the cardiovascular system (hemodynamics), nonlinearities arise from the convective terms in the fluid momentum equations and from the pressure-dependent mechanical properties of artery walls. For real-time, patient-specific simulations, which could be used for surgical planning or medical device testing, ROMs with [hyper-reduction](@entry_id:163369) are a critical enabling technology .

*   **Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) Methods:** The utility of DEIM is not limited to a specific [spatial discretization](@entry_id:172158). For advanced methods like DG, which are popular for [hyperbolic conservation laws](@entry_id:147752), the assembly of the nonlinear residual involves integrals over element interiors and faces. Even with a reduced basis, evaluating the nonlinear flux at all necessary quadrature points remains an $\mathcal{O}(N)$ operation. DEIM provides an effective way to reduce this cost by computing the flux contributions only for the elements containing the $m$ interpolation points .

### Advanced Topics and Theoretical Considerations

The successful application of DEIM requires more than a simple substitution of the nonlinear term with its approximation. One must consider its interaction with the broader numerical framework and its effect on the physical and mathematical structure of the model.

#### Interaction with Numerical Solvers

When integrating a DEIM-reduced model in time, care must be taken to ensure consistency with the chosen time-stepping scheme. For [coupled multiphysics](@entry_id:747969) problems, such as a thermal-electrochemical battery model, one might choose between a fully implicit [monolithic scheme](@entry_id:178657) or a partitioned operator-splitting (OS) scheme.

*   In a **[monolithic scheme](@entry_id:178657)**, where all state variables are solved for simultaneously using a Newton-type method, it is crucial to use a **consistent Jacobian**. This means the Jacobian matrix used in the Newton iterations must be the exact derivative of the DEIM-approximated residual. Using the Jacobian of the original, un-approximated nonlinearity leads to an inexact Newton method, which destroys the [quadratic convergence](@entry_id:142552) rate. Preserving the [unconditional stability](@entry_id:145631) of the implicit scheme also relies on the DEIM approximation not destroying the dissipative structure of the original system .

*   In an **OS scheme**, where different physics are solved sequentially, DEIM's impact is different. For example, if the thermal part is updated explicitly, the scheme is subject to a stability constraint on the time step $\Delta t$ determined by the linear thermal operator. Applying DEIM to the nonlinear heat source term does not change this linear stability bound. However, the splitting itself introduces an error, and the additional [approximation error](@entry_id:138265) from DEIM can increase the total error of the scheme .

Many physics-based models, including those for batteries, are naturally formulated as systems of Differential-Algebraic Equations (DAEs) rather than ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This arises from physical constraints that must hold instantaneously, such as [charge conservation](@entry_id:151839). For a semi-explicit index-1 DAE, the index is determined by the invertibility of the Jacobian of the algebraic constraints with respect to the algebraic variables. If DEIM is applied only to the nonlinear terms in the differential equations, the DAE index is preserved. If, however, DEIM is also used to approximate nonlinearities within the algebraic constraints, one must ensure that the approximation does not render the algebraic Jacobian singular, as this would increase the DAE index and make the problem significantly harder to solve .

#### Structure Preservation and Physical Consistency

Perhaps the most significant challenge in applying standard DEIM is its potential to violate fundamental physical laws and mathematical structures. Discretized conservation laws often lead to matrices with specific properties (e.g., symmetry, [positive-definiteness](@entry_id:149643), or M-matrix structure) that guarantee physical consistency (e.g., conservation, [dissipativity](@entry_id:162959), or non-negativity of concentrations).

DEIM, as a form of interpolatory or collocative projection, is generally not structure-preserving. The DEIM [projection operator](@entry_id:143175) is not symmetric, and when applied to a [symmetric positive-definite](@entry_id:145886) operator, the resulting reduced operator is typically not symmetric. For diffusion-reaction problems, this can lead to a loss of the M-matrix property in the system Jacobian. The consequence can be disastrous: the numerical solution may develop unphysical oscillations and negative concentrations, rendering the simulation meaningless .

This has motivated a vibrant area of research into **structure-preserving [hyper-reduction](@entry_id:163369)** techniques. Several remedies exist:
1.  **Constrained Interpolation:** The DEIM coefficients can be solved for using a non-negative [least-squares method](@entry_id:149056), which enforces that the approximation is a positive combination of snapshots.
2.  **Structure-Preserving Formulations:** Methods like Energy-Conserving Sampling and Weighting (ECSW) reformulate the problem to find a set of positive [quadrature weights](@entry_id:753910) for the sampled points, which can explicitly preserve symmetry and [positive-definiteness](@entry_id:149643) .
3.  **State Transformation:** One can reformulate the equations in terms of a transformed variable, for instance, solving for the logarithm of the concentration, $y = \ln(c)$. The state $c = \exp(y)$ is then guaranteed to be positive. This enforces the physical bound by construction .

#### Error Analysis and Certification

A rigorous engineering workflow requires not just a fast answer, but an answer with known and controllable accuracy. The error of the DEIM approximation, $\|f - \widehat{f}\|$, can be bounded by the product of two terms: the error of the [best approximation](@entry_id:268380) in the DEIM subspace, $\|(I - UU^T)f\|$, and a stability constant, $C_{\mathrm{int}} = \|(P^T U)^{-1}\|$, which depends on the conditioning of the DEIM interpolation. This highlights that the accuracy depends on both having a good basis $U$ and making a good choice of interpolation points $P$ .

This [approximation error](@entry_id:138265) in the nonlinear term then acts as a perturbation source in the [system dynamics](@entry_id:136288). For stable systems, its effect on the state error can be bounded using Duhamel's principle. This allows one to propagate the DEIM [approximation error](@entry_id:138265) to a provable bound on the error in a final quantity of interest, such as the effluent concentration from a reactive transport column . This provides a path toward certified ROMs, where the speedup from DEIM does not come at the cost of unknown or uncontrolled accuracy.

### Conclusion

The Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method is far more than a mathematical curiosity; it is a powerful computational tool that unlocks the potential of [projection-based model reduction](@entry_id:753807) for a vast array of nonlinear problems in science and engineering. By breaking the curse of nonlinearity, DEIM enables the use of high-fidelity models in many-query applications like optimization and [uncertainty quantification](@entry_id:138597), transforming them from descriptive to predictive tools.

As we have seen, its successful application is a nuanced task. It requires a strategic understanding of where to apply it for maximum impact, careful integration with the chosen numerical methods for [time integration](@entry_id:170891), and an awareness of its limitations, particularly regarding the preservation of physical structures. The ongoing development of structure-preserving [hyper-reduction](@entry_id:163369) methods and rigorous a posteriori [error bounds](@entry_id:139888) continues to expand the domain of problems that can be tackled reliably and efficiently. In doing so, DEIM and its successors are paving the way for the next generation of predictive, multi-scale, and multi-[physics simulation](@entry_id:139862) technologies.
