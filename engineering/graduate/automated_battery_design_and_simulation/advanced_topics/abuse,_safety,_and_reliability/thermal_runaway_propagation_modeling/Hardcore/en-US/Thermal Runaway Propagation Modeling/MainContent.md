## Introduction
The widespread adoption of lithium-ion batteries in everything from electric vehicles to [grid-scale energy storage](@entry_id:276991) has made their safety a paramount concern. The most catastrophic failure mode is thermal runaway, a rapid, self-sustaining exothermic reaction that can lead to fire, explosion, and the release of toxic gases. Preventing a single cell failure from cascading into a full pack-level event—a phenomenon known as thermal runaway propagation—is one of the most critical challenges in battery engineering. Addressing this challenge requires moving beyond empirical testing to develop predictive, physics-based models that can guide the design of safer and more reliable battery systems.

This article provides a comprehensive exploration of thermal runaway propagation modeling, designed for graduate-level engineers and scientists. Over the next three chapters, you will gain a deep understanding of this complex phenomenon. The first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, delves into the fundamental physics, from the self-accelerating Arrhenius kinetics that drive the event to the governing equations of [heat transport](@entry_id:199637) and the key criteria that define the onset of instability. The second chapter, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, demonstrates how these models are applied in practice to engineer passive and active safety systems, optimize [battery pack design](@entry_id:1121431), and draws parallels to similar thermal stability problems in other scientific fields. Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** section provides practical exercises to solidify your understanding of key modeling concepts, from [parameter estimation](@entry_id:139349) to stability analysis.

## Principles and Mechanisms

### The Physics of Self-Accelerating Reactions

At its core, **thermal runaway** in a lithium-ion cell is not merely a state of being hot; it is a dynamic, self-sustaining process of [thermal instability](@entry_id:151762). The defining characteristic that separates thermal runaway from simple overheating is the presence of an internal positive feedback loop. This occurs when the heat generated by internal exothermic chemical reactions, $Q_{\mathrm{int}}(T)$, exceeds the rate at which the cell can dissipate heat to its surroundings, $H_{\mathrm{loss}}(T)$. The governing energy balance for a simplified, lumped-mass cell illustrates this fundamental principle :

$$ \rho c V \frac{dT}{dt} = Q_{\mathrm{int}}(T) + Q_{\mathrm{ext}}(t) - H_{\mathrm{loss}}(T) $$

Here, $\rho$ is the average density, $c$ is the specific heat, $V$ is the volume, and $T$ is the temperature of the cell. The term $Q_{\mathrm{ext}}(t)$ represents any external heat source, such as heat from an adjacent failing cell. While an external source may act as a trigger, initiating the temperature rise, it is not a requisite for sustaining the event. Thermal runaway is the regime where, even after the external trigger is removed ($Q_{\mathrm{ext}}(t) = 0$), the temperature continues to rise because the [internal heat generation](@entry_id:1126624) outpaces heat loss, i.e., $Q_{\mathrm{int}}(T) > H_{\mathrm{loss}}(T)$.

The source of this critical internal feedback lies in the temperature dependence of the reaction kinetics. The rate of heat generation, $Q_{\mathrm{int}}(T)$, is the sum of contributions from several parallel and sequential exothermic decomposition reactions. Each reaction rate, $r_i$, typically follows an **Arrhenius-type** law:

$$ r_i(T) \propto A_i \exp\left(-\frac{E_i}{RT}\right) $$

where $A_i$ is a pre-exponential factor, $E_i$ is the activation energy, and $R$ is the universal gas constant. The exponential dependence on temperature means that a small increase in $T$ can lead to a dramatic increase in the reaction rate, and thus a dramatic increase in $Q_{\mathrm{int}}$. This creates a powerful positive feedback: higher temperature leads to faster reactions, which release more heat, leading to an even higher temperature.

The primary chemical pathways that enable this self-accelerating behavior in typical lithium-ion cells include, in approximate order of increasing [onset temperature](@entry_id:197328) :

1.  **Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) Decomposition:** The protective SEI layer on the anode (negative electrode) is metastable and begins to decompose exothermically at moderately elevated temperatures (typically 80-120°C). Its breakdown exposes the highly reactive lithiated graphite to the electrolyte.

2.  **Anode-Electrolyte Reactions:** Once the SEI is compromised, the intercalated lithium in the anode reacts directly with the electrolyte solvents, generating significant heat and flammable hydrocarbon gases.

3.  **Cathode Decomposition and Oxygen Release:** At higher temperatures (typically >180-200°C), the cathode material (e.g., LiCoO₂, NMC, NCA) becomes unstable and decomposes. This process is itself exothermic and, critically, can release gaseous oxygen.

4.  **Electrolyte Oxidation:** The released oxygen acts as a powerful oxidizer that vigorously combusts the flammable organic electrolyte. This final stage is often the most energetic and violent, responsible for the most rapid temperature and pressure increases observed in thermal runaway.

### Governing Equations of Heat Generation and Transport

To move beyond a lumped-mass approximation and capture the development of internal hotspots, we must model the spatial and temporal evolution of the temperature field, $T(x,t)$. This is described by the general [energy balance equation](@entry_id:191484), a partial differential equation (PDE) that applies the first law of thermodynamics to a differential control volume  :

$$ \rho c_p(T) \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \nabla \cdot \left( k(T) \nabla T \right) + \dot{q}(T) $$

Let us deconstruct this fundamental equation. The term on the left, $\rho c_p(T) \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}$, represents the rate of change of thermal energy stored per unit volume, where $\rho$ is the density and $c_p(T)$ is the temperature-dependent specific heat capacity. The first term on the right, $\nabla \cdot \left( k(T) \nabla T \right)$, describes the net rate of heat conducted into the volume according to **Fourier's Law**, where $k(T)$ is the temperature-dependent thermal conductivity. The final term, $\dot{q}(T)$, is the [volumetric heat generation](@entry_id:1133893) rate from all [exothermic reactions](@entry_id:199674).

In practice, the [thermophysical properties](@entry_id:1133078) $k(T)$ and $c_p(T)$ are often not constant over the wide temperature range of thermal runaway. Typically, for lithium-ion cell materials, $c_p$ increases with temperature, while $k$ (especially the through-plane conductivity) tends to decrease. Neglecting these dependencies by using constant values (e.g., evaluated at room temperature) can introduce significant bias into simulation results .
*   Assuming a constant, lower thermal inertia ($c_p$) leads to a **pessimistic** prediction of transient risk; the model will predict a faster temperature rise and a shorter time-to-runaway than what would occur in reality.
*   Assuming a constant, higher thermal conductivity ($k$) is **optimistic** about stability; the model overestimates the cell's ability to dissipate internal heat, making it seem less prone to runaway than it truly is. This is particularly critical in conduction-limited scenarios where internal heat removal is the bottleneck.

Furthermore, [heat transport](@entry_id:199637) is not monolithic. At interfaces between different materials within the cell (e.g., electrode and current collector), microscopic imperfections create an **interfacial thermal contact resistance**, $R_c$. This resistance impedes heat flow, causing a distinct temperature jump, $\Delta T = q R_c$, where $q$ is the heat flux across the interface. In a scenario with high internal heat generation, a large $R_c$ can significantly elevate the temperature of the heat-generating layers relative to the heat-dissipating components. For a fixed heat flux determined by the reaction rate, increasing $R_c$ directly increases the internal temperature, which can exacerbate the reaction rates and intensify internal hotspots, accelerating the onset of runaway .

### Onset Criteria and Modeling Regimes

The complexity of the governing PDE often necessitates simplified models to analyze the critical conditions for runaway onset. The choice of an appropriate model is dictated by the relative importance of internal heat conduction versus external heat transfer. This relationship is captured by a dimensionless parameter, the **Biot number**, $Bi$:

$$ Bi = \frac{hL}{k} $$

Physically, the Biot number represents the ratio of the internal thermal resistance of the cell (or a layer) to the external thermal resistance at its surface: $Bi = R_{\text{internal}} / R_{\text{external}}$ . Here, $L$ is a characteristic length (e.g., half-thickness of the cell), $k$ is the internal thermal conductivity, and $h$ is the convective or contact heat [transfer coefficient](@entry_id:264443) at the surface. The magnitude of $Bi$ determines the nature of the temperature profile within the cell and, consequently, the appropriate modeling approach.

#### The Lumped Regime ($Bi \ll 1$): Semenov Theory

When the Biot number is small ($Bi \ll 1$, typically less than 0.1), the internal thermal resistance is negligible compared to the external resistance. Heat diffuses so quickly within the cell that its temperature remains spatially uniform, $T(x,t) \approx T(t)$. This is the **lumped capacitance** approximation. In this regime, the system's thermal stability is governed by the competition between the total heat generated within the volume and the heat lost from the surface. This leads to the **Semenov model** of [thermal explosion](@entry_id:166460) . The steady-state condition ($\frac{dT}{dt}=0$) requires a balance between heat generation, $\dot{Q}_{\text{gen}}(T)$, and heat loss, $\dot{Q}_{\text{loss}}(T)$:

$$ \dot{Q}_{\text{gen}}(T) = \dot{Q}_{\text{loss}}(T) \approx hA_s(T-T_a) $$

where $A_s$ is the surface area and $T_a$ is the ambient temperature. Graphically, [steady-state solutions](@entry_id:200351) are the intersection points of the S-shaped Arrhenius generation curve and the linear heat loss line. As conditions change (e.g., ambient temperature rises or cooling deteriorates), the system can reach a critical point where the heat loss line becomes tangent to the generation curve. Beyond this point, no stable, low-temperature steady state exists, and the temperature will rise uncontrollably. This tangency point defines the onset of thermal runaway.

This condition can be analyzed more formally through a **[saddle-node bifurcation](@entry_id:269823)** analysis . The critical point occurs when the heat generation rate and the heat loss rate are equal, *and* their sensitivities to temperature are also equal:

$$ \dot{Q}_{\text{gen}}(T_c) = \dot{Q}_{\text{loss}}(T_c) \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{d\dot{Q}_{\text{gen}}}{dT}\bigg|_{T_c} = \frac{d\dot{Q}_{\text{loss}}}{dT}\bigg|_{T_c} $$

Solving this system of equations yields the critical parameters (e.g., a critical heat [transfer coefficient](@entry_id:264443), $h_c$) below which the system is unconditionally unstable. For $h > h_c$, two equilibria exist: a stable low-temperature state and an unstable high-temperature state that represents the "point of no return."

#### The Distributed Regime ($Bi \gtrsim 1$): Frank-Kamenetskii Theory

When the Biot number is large ($Bi \gtrsim 1$), internal conduction resistance is significant or dominant. This means that heat is removed from the surface much more easily than it can be transported from the cell's core. Consequently, substantial temperature gradients develop, with a pronounced hotspot forming in the cell's interior. A lumped model is no longer valid.

This regime is described by the **Frank-Kamenetskii model**, which analyzes the [steady-state heat conduction](@entry_id:177666) equation, resolving the internal temperature profile :

$$ \nabla \cdot (k \nabla T) + \dot{q}(T) = 0 $$

The core assumption is that the thermal profile establishes itself much faster than the reactants are consumed (a [quasi-steady-state approximation](@entry_id:163315)). The onset of runaway is identified as the critical condition beyond which no [steady-state solution](@entry_id:276115) to this [boundary value problem](@entry_id:138753) exists. The analysis leads to a critical value of a dimensionless group, the **Frank-Kamenetskii parameter**, $\delta$, which relates reaction kinetics to [heat transport](@entry_id:199637).

### Scaling Effects and Numerical Challenges

#### The Effect of Cell Size

A crucial principle in [battery safety](@entry_id:160758) design is that **larger cells are inherently less thermally stable**. This can be understood through a simple [scaling analysis](@entry_id:153681) . For a family of geometrically similar cells of characteristic size $L$, the volume $V$ (and thus the total mass of reactants) scales with $L^3$, while the surface area $A$ available for heat dissipation scales with $L^2$.

The total heat generation rate, $\dot{Q}_{\text{gen}}$, being a volumetric phenomenon, is proportional to the volume: $\dot{Q}_{\text{gen}} \propto V \propto L^3$. In contrast, the heat loss rate, $\dot{Q}_{\text{loss}}$, is a surface phenomenon and is proportional to the area: $\dot{Q}_{\text{loss}} \propto A \propto L^2$.

The condition for thermal stability requires that heat loss can overcome heat generation. The ratio of these two quantities dictates stability:

$$ \frac{\text{Heat Loss}}{\text{Heat Generation}} \propto \frac{A}{V} \propto \frac{L^2}{L^3} = \frac{1}{L} $$

This simple relationship reveals a profound consequence: as the cell size $L$ increases, the [surface-area-to-volume ratio](@entry_id:141558) decreases. This means the cell's ability to dissipate heat diminishes relative to its capacity for heat generation. Consequently, for a given chemistry and cooling environment, there exists a critical size $L_c$ beyond which the cell becomes unstable. This principle is a primary driver for the modular design of large battery packs, which use many smaller cells rather than a single massive one.

#### Numerical Stiffness

The accurate simulation of thermal runaway presents a significant numerical challenge known as **stiffness**. This issue arises from the coupling of physical processes that occur on vastly different time scales .
*   **Heat conduction** is a relatively slow, diffusive process. The characteristic time for heat to diffuse across a cell of thickness $L$ is $\tau_{\text{diff}} \sim L^2/\alpha$, where $\alpha=k/(\rho c_p)$ is the [thermal diffusivity](@entry_id:144337). This is typically on the order of seconds to minutes.
*   **Chemical reaction kinetics**, governed by the Arrhenius law, are highly non-linear. At low temperatures, reaction rates are negligible and the characteristic reaction time is very long. However, as temperature rises into the runaway regime, the reaction rate explodes, and the characteristic time can collapse to microseconds or less.

A simulation that couples these phenomena must resolve the fastest process to remain stable if an [explicit time-stepping](@entry_id:168157) scheme is used. This would require prohibitively small time steps, on the order of microseconds, for the entire duration of the simulation, even when the overall system temperature is changing slowly. To overcome this, thermal runaway models almost universally require **[implicit time integration](@entry_id:171761) methods**. These numerical schemes are stable even with much larger time steps, allowing the step size to be dictated by the accuracy needed to capture the evolution of the slower process (conduction), making the simulation computationally feasible.

### Mechanisms of Cell-to-Cell Propagation

When a single cell in a battery module enters thermal runaway, it releases a tremendous amount of thermal energy, which can heat adjacent cells and trigger them into runaway as well. This cascading failure is known as **thermal runaway propagation**. The propagation is mediated by several parallel heat transfer pathways connecting the failing cell to its neighbors .

1.  **Solid Conduction:** Heat can conduct through any solid materials in direct contact with the cells, such as module structural frames, busbars, and spacer materials between cells. In tightly packed modules, this is often the most significant pathway, especially if thermally conductive materials are used.

2.  **Radiation:** The surface of a cell in runaway can reach extremely high temperatures (e.g., 800 K or more). At these temperatures, thermal radiation becomes a very effective heat transfer mechanism. The rate of heat transfer is proportional to $T^4$, making it highly significant in the high-temperature regime. It transfers heat across any gas gaps or vacuum between cells.

3.  **Convection:** If the failing cell vents hot gases and ejecta, these can flow over neighboring cells, transferring heat via forced convection. This can be a dominant mechanism, especially in modules with significant open space, and is responsible for rapid, long-range propagation. Before venting, natural convection in the gas gaps between cells provides a minor heat transfer path.

4.  **Electrical Cross-Talk:** If the failure involves an internal short circuit, it can cause large fault currents to flow through shared electrical interconnects. The resulting **Joule heating** ($P = I^2R$) in the busbars can conduct heat into neighboring cells. However, in well-designed systems with fuses and current interrupt devices (CIDs), this pathway is typically a minor contributor compared to direct thermal transfer.

A quantitative comparison for a typical module with closely spaced cylindrical cells might show solid conduction through spacers as the dominant pre-venting pathway, followed by radiation, with [natural convection](@entry_id:140507) and electrical cross-talk being of lesser importance . Understanding the relative importance of these pathways is critical for designing effective thermal barriers and mitigation strategies.

### A Hierarchical Approach to Model Validation

Given the complexity of the physics involved, creating a credible and predictive model of thermal runaway propagation is a challenging task. The most robust approach is a **hierarchical, multi-scale validation strategy** that builds confidence from the bottom up, ensuring that the model is physically grounded at every level .

The hierarchy typically involves three scales:

1.  **Unit-Reaction Scale:** The process begins at the most fundamental level. Small samples of individual [battery materials](@entry_id:1121422) (anode, cathode, electrolyte) are tested using techniques like Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). These experiments isolate the chemical reactions from complex transport effects, allowing for the direct measurement of intrinsic kinetic parameters: reaction enthalpies ($\Delta H_i$), activation energies ($E_i$), and pre-exponential factors ($A_i$).

2.  **Single-Cell Scale:** The kinetic parameter set identified at the unit-reaction scale is then used as a fixed input to a spatially resolved PDE model of a single cell. This model introduces the physics of [heat transport](@entry_id:199637) ($k, c_p$) and geometry. The model's predictions (e.g., surface temperature during a nail penetration or overcharge test) are validated against experimental data from corresponding single-cell abuse tests. The key principle here is **parameter invariance**: the fundamental kinetics are not re-tuned. Instead, [transport properties](@entry_id:203130) like $k$ and the surface heat [transfer coefficient](@entry_id:264443) $h$ are determined at this scale.

3.  **Module/Pack Scale:** Finally, the validated single-cell model is used to inform a larger-scale, often simplified (e.g., lumped-parameter network) model of a multi-cell module. The heat generation behavior of each cell in the network is taken directly from the previously validated model. New parameters introduced at this scale, such as the thermal conductances ($G_{jk}$) between cells, represent the cell-to-cell heat transfer pathways. The model is then validated against full-scale propagation tests.

The credibility of the final model stems directly from this hierarchical process. A single, physically identified set of kinetic parameters, when combined with appropriate transport parameters at each respective scale, is shown to explain behavior across all scales of observation. This ensures the model is not merely a "curve fit" to a specific experiment but a true representation of the underlying physics, giving it genuine predictive power for designing safer battery systems.
