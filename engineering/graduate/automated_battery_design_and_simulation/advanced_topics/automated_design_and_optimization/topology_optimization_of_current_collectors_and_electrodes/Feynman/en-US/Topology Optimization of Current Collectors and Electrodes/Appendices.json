            "problem": "Consider a rectangular metallic current collector (CC) of length $L$, width $W$, and thickness $t$, having uniform electrical conductivity $\\sigma_{c}$. The CC is bonded over its entire width $W$ to a porous electrode that draws a uniform areal reaction current density $j$ from the CC along the $x$-direction over $0 \\le x \\le L$. A tab is attached along the entire width at $x=0$ and is the sole point of external current extraction. Assume the lateral electric field and current density in the CC are uniform across its thickness and width so that lateral transport can be modeled as one-dimensional along $x$. Using only conservation of charge and Ohm’s law as the starting point, derive the voltage drop $\\Delta V$ between the tab at $x=0$ and the far edge at $x=L$ as a function of $j$, $L$, $t$, and $\\sigma_{c}$. Then, express the result in terms of the sheet resistance (SR) defined for a thin conductor as $R_{s} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{c} t}$. Finally, discuss how the derived expression mathematically encodes the design trade-off between CC mass and ohmic loss when $t$ is varied, assuming the CC material density is $\\rho_{m}$ and the CC mass is $M = \\rho_{m} W L t$. Provide your final answer as a single closed-form analytic expression for the voltage drop $\\Delta V$, expressed in volts. No numerical rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The derivation proceeds by first establishing the current profile within the current collector and then using Ohm's law to determine the resulting voltage profile.\n\nLet $x$ be the spatial coordinate along the length of the current collector, with the tab at $x=0$ and the far end at $x=L$. The current is generated within the electrode and flows through the collector towards the tab at $x=0$. Let $I(x)$ represent the magnitude of the electrical current in the collector at position $x$. This current flows in the negative $x$-direction. The current at a point $x$ is the accumulation of all the current drawn from the electrode over the region from $x$ to $L$.\n\nThe current drawn from a differential strip of length $dx$ and width $W$ is $dI = j \\cdot (W dx)$. Applying the principle of conservation of charge, the change in current $dI$ over a segment $dx$ is equal to the current drawn from the electrode in that segment.\nConsidering the flow towards $x=0$, the current's magnitude increases as $x$ decreases. The current magnitude at position $x$ is the integral of the current contributions from $x$ to $L$:\n$$ I(x) = \\int_{x}^{L} jW \\, d\\xi = jW[\\xi]_{x}^{L} = jW(L-x) $$\nThis expression correctly shows that the total current extracted at the tab ($x=0$) is $I(0) = jWL$, which is the total areal current density integrated over the entire surface area of the electrode. At the far end ($x=L$), the current is $I(L) = 0$, as expected.\n\nNext, we apply Ohm's law in its differential form. The electric field $E_x$ along the collector is related to the voltage gradient by $E_x = -\\frac{dV}{dx}$. The current density within the collector material, $j_{cc}$, is related to the electric field by $j_{cc} = \\sigma_c E_x$. The total current $I_x$ is the product of the current density and the cross-sectional area $A = Wt$. The current $I_x$ is a vector component; since the physical current flows in the negative $x$-direction, its component is $I_x = -I(x) = -jW(L-x)$.\nSo, we have:\n$$ I_x = A \\cdot j_{cc} = (Wt) \\cdot (\\sigma_c E_x) = Wt\\sigma_c \\left(-\\frac{dV}{dx}\\right) $$\nSubstituting the expression for the current component $I_x$:\n$$ -jW(L-x) = -Wt\\sigma_c \\frac{dV}{dx} $$\nThe terms $-W$ cancel on both sides, yielding the differential equation for the voltage $V(x)$:\n$$ \\frac{dV}{dx} = \\frac{j(L-x)}{\\sigma_c t} $$\nTo find the voltage drop $\\Delta V$ between the far end ($x=L$) and the tab ($x=0$), we integrate this expression. Since current flows from $x=L$ to $x=0$, the potential at $x=L$ will be higher than at $x=0$. The voltage drop is therefore $\\Delta V = V(L) - V(0)$.\n$$ \\Delta V = V(L) - V(0) = \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{dV}{dx} \\, dx $$\n$$ \\Delta V = \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{j(L-x)}{\\sigma_c t} \\, dx $$\nThe terms $\\frac{j}{\\sigma_c t}$ are constant with respect to the integration variable $x$:\n$$ \\Delta V = \\frac{j}{\\sigma_c t} \\int_{0}^{L} (L-x) \\, dx $$\n$$ \\Delta V = \\frac{j}{\\sigma_c t} \\left[ Lx - \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right]_{0}^{L} $$\n$$ \\Delta V = \\frac{j}{\\sigma_c t} \\left( \\left( L(L) - \\frac{L^2}{2} \\right) - \\left( L(0) - \\frac{0^2}{2} \\right) \\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta V = \\frac{j}{\\sigma_c t} \\left( L^2 - \\frac{L^2}{2} \\right) = \\frac{j}{\\sigma_c t} \\left( \\frac{L^2}{2} \\right) $$\nThe final expression for the voltage drop is:\n$$ \\Delta V = \\frac{jL^2}{2\\sigma_c t} $$\nThe problem asks to express this result in terms of the sheet resistance, $R_s = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_c t}$. Substituting this definition into our result yields:\n$$ \\Delta V = \\frac{1}{2} j L^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sigma_c t}\\right) = \\frac{jL^2 R_s}{2} $$\nThis expression shows that the voltage drop is independent of the collector width $W$, a consequence of the current magnitude being proportional to $W$ while the collector's line resistance (resistance per unit length) is proportional to $W^{-1}$, causing $W$ to cancel in the voltage gradient calculation.\n\nFinally, we discuss the design trade-off between mass and ohmic loss. The ohmic voltage drop is given by $\\Delta V = \\frac{jL^2}{2\\sigma_c t}$. The mass of the current collector is given by $M = \\rho_m W L t$.\nWe observe the following dependencies on the thickness, $t$:\n1. The voltage drop $\\Delta V$ is inversely proportional to thickness: $\\Delta V \\propto \\frac{1}{t}$. Increasing the collector thickness reduces its resistance, thus lowering the ohmic voltage penalty.\n2. The mass $M$ is directly proportional to thickness: $M \\propto t$. Increasing the collector thickness adds mass, which is detrimental to the battery's specific energy (energy per unit mass).\n\nThis represents a classic engineering trade-off. To make it mathematically explicit, we can examine the product of the two key performance metrics, $\\Delta V$ and $M$:\n$$ \\Delta V \\cdot M = \\left( \\frac{jL^2}{2\\sigma_c t} \\right) \\cdot (\\rho_m W L t) $$\nThe thickness $t$ cancels in the product:\n$$ \\Delta V \\cdot M = \\frac{jL^3 W \\rho_m}{2\\sigma_c} $$\nThis product is a constant for a given material selection ($\\rho_m, \\sigma_c$), cell geometry ($L, W$), and operating condition ($j$). This constant product mathematically encodes the trade-off: any attempt to reduce mass by decreasing $t$ will result in a proportional increase in the voltage drop $\\Delta V$, and vice-versa. For example, halving the collector thickness (and thus its mass) will double the ohmic voltage drop. The designer must choose a thickness $t$ that optimally balances the competing requirements of low mass and low ohmic loss for a specific application.",

The boundary at $x=L$ is symmetry-equivalent to a no-flux condition for the in-plane current.\n- Case B (periodic tabs): Tabs are periodically placed at $x=0$ and $x=s$, both held at the same reference potential.

The principal-basis conductivity tensor is diagonal:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_p = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{\\parallel}  0 \\\\ 0  \\sigma_{\\perp} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe change-of-basis matrix and its transpose are:\n$$ Q = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta  \\sin\\theta \\\\ -\\sin\\theta  \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad Q^{\\mathsf{T}} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta  -\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta  \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe now compute the matrix product $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_d = Q^{\\mathsf{T}} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_p Q$:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_d = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta  -\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta  \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{\\parallel}  0 \\\\ 0  \\sigma_{\\perp} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta  \\sin\\theta \\\\ -\\sin\\theta  \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} $$\nFirst, we multiply the first two matrices:\n$$ Q^{\\mathsf{T}} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_p = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{\\parallel}\\cos\\theta  -\\sigma_{\\perp}\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sigma_{\\parallel}\\sin\\theta  \\sigma_{\\perp}\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNext, we multiply this result by $Q$:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_d = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{\\parallel}\\cos\\theta  -\\sigma_{\\perp}\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sigma_{\\parallel}\\sin\\theta  \\sigma_{\\perp}\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta  \\sin\\theta \\\\ -\\sin\\theta  \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} $$\nPerforming the final matrix multiplication gives the components of $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_d$:\n$$ \\sigma_{xx}^{(d)} = (\\sigma_{\\parallel}\\cos\\theta)(\\cos\\theta) + (-\\sigma_{\\perp}\\sin\\theta)(-\\sin\\theta) = \\sigma_{\\parallel}\\cos^2\\theta + \\sigma_{\\perp}\\sin^2\\theta $$\n$$ \\sigma_{xy}^{(d)} = (\\sigma_{\\parallel}\\cos\\theta)(\\sin\\theta) + (-\\sigma_{\\perp}\\sin\\theta)(\\cos\\theta) = (\\sigma_{\\parallel} - \\sigma_{\\perp})\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta $$\n$$ \\sigma_{yx}^{(d)} = (\\sigma_{\\parallel}\\sin\\theta)(\\cos\\theta) + (\\sigma_{\\perp}\\cos\\theta)(-\\sin\\theta) = (\\sigma_{\\parallel} - \\sigma_{\\perp})\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta $$\n$$ \\sigma_{yy}^{(d)} = (\\sigma_{\\parallel}\\sin\\theta)(\\sin\\theta) + (\\sigma_{\\perp}\\cos\\theta)(\\cos\\theta) = \\sigma_{\\parallel}\\sin^2\\theta + \\sigma_{\\perp}\\cos^2\\theta $$\nAs expected for a physical property tensor derived from a symmetric tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_d$ is symmetric ($\\sigma_{xy}^{(d)} = \\sigma_{yx}^{(d)}$).\n\nThe explicit expressions are:\n$$ \\sigma_{xx}^{(d)} = \\sigma_{\\parallel}\\cos^2\\theta + \\sigma_{\\perp}\\sin^2\\theta $$\n$$ \\sigma_{xy}^{(d)} = (\\sigma_{\\parallel} - \\sigma_{\\perp})\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta $$\n$$ \\sigma_{yy}^{(d)} = \\sigma_{\\parallel}\\sin^2\\theta + \\sigma_{\\perp}\\cos^2\\theta $$\n\n### Task 3: Numerical Computation of $\\sigma_{xy}^{(d)}$\n\nWe are given the following values:\nPrincipal conductivities: $\\sigma_{\\parallel} = 3.5 \\times 10^{7} \\, \\mathrm{S/m}$ and $\\sigma_{\\perp} = 2.0 \\times 10^{7} \\, \\mathrm{S/m}$.\nTab orientation angle: $\\theta = 30^{\\circ}$.\n\nWe use the derived expression for the off-diagonal component $\\sigma_{xy}^{(d)}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{xy}^{(d)} = (\\sigma_{\\parallel} - \\sigma_{\\perp})\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta $$\nFor $\\theta = 30^{\\circ}$, we have the exact trigonometric values:\n$$ \\sin(30^{\\circ}) = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n$$ \\cos(30^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} $$\nSubstituting all the values into the expression:\n$$ \\sigma_{xy}^{(d)} = (3.5 \\times 10^{7} - 2.0 \\times 10^{7}) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{xy}^{(d)} = (1.5 \\times 10^{7}) \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right) $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$ \\sigma_{xy}^{(d)} = \\frac{1.5 \\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times 10^{7} \\approx \\frac{1.5 \\times 1.7320508}{4} \\times 10^{7} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{xy}^{(d)} \\approx 0.64951905 \\times 10^{7} \\, \\mathrm{S/m} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{xy}^{(d)} \\approx 6.4951905 \\times 10^{6} \\, \\mathrm{S/m} $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ \\sigma_{xy}^{(d)} \\approx 6.495 \\times 10^{6} \\, \\mathrm{S/m} $$",
