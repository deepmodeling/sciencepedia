The critical scaling law is a central tenet of this theory. Ohm's law is a fundamental principle of electromagnetism.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It contains no contradictions, missing information, or fallacious premises. Therefore, I will proceed with formulating a solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\n**Task 1: Constitutive Model for Effective Conductivity $\\sigma_{\\text{eff}}(x)$**\n\nThe problem states that the macroscopic conductivity near a percolation threshold obeys a critical scaling law. This law specifies that the conductivity is proportional to the difference between the volume fraction $\\phi$ and the critical threshold $\\phi_c$, raised to the power of a critical exponent $t$. This relationship is valid for volume fractions above the threshold, i.e., $\\phi > \\phi_c$. The pre-factor $\\sigma_{0}$ incorporates the constant microstructural details. Combining these elements, the constitutive relation for the effective conductivity $\\sigma_{\\text{eff}}$ as a function of the volume fraction $\\phi$ is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{eff}}(\\phi) = \\sigma_{0} (\\phi - \\phi_{c})^{t}\n$$\nUnder the local homogenization assumption, this macroscopic law can be applied locally at each position $x$. Thus, we substitute the spatially varying volume fraction $\\phi(x)$ into the relation:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{eff}}(x) = \\sigma_{0} (\\phi(x) - \\phi_{c})^{t} \\quad \\text{for} \\quad \\phi(x) > \\phi_{c}\n$$\nThis is the required local constitutive model.\n\n**Task 2: Logarithmic Sensitivity $\\kappa(x)$**\n\nThe logarithmic sensitivity is defined as:\n$$\n\\kappa(x) \\equiv \\frac{\\left|\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{\\text{eff}}(x)}{\\partial \\phi(x)}\\right|}{\\sigma_{\\text{eff}}(x)}\n$$\nThe notation $\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{\\text{eff}}(x)}{\\partial \\phi(x)}$ indicates the derivative of the function $\\sigma_{\\text{eff}}(\\phi)$ with respect to its argument $\\phi$, evaluated at $\\phi=\\phi(x)$. We first calculate this derivative using the expression for $\\sigma_{\\text{eff}}(x)$ from Task 1. Applying the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{\\text{eff}}(x)}{\\partial \\phi(x)} = \\frac{d}{d\\phi} \\left[ \\sigma_{0} (\\phi - \\phi_c)^t \\right]_{\\phi=\\phi(x)} = \\sigma_{0} \\cdot t \\cdot (\\phi(x) - \\phi_c)^{t-1} \\cdot \\frac{d}{d\\phi}(\\phi - \\phi_c)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{\\text{eff}}(x)}{\\partial \\phi(x)} = t\\,\\sigma_{0}\\,(\\phi(x) - \\phi_c)^{t-1}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that $t > 0$, $\\sigma_{0}$ is a positive pre-factor, and we are in the region where $\\phi(x) > \\phi_c$. Therefore, the derivative is strictly positive, and the absolute value in the definition of $\\kappa(x)$ can be omitted.\nNow, we substitute the derivative and the expression for $\\sigma_{\\text{eff}}(x)$ into the definition of $\\kappa(x)$:\n$$\n\\kappa(x) = \\frac{t\\,\\sigma_{0}\\,(\\phi(x) - \\phi_c)^{t-1}}{\\sigma_{0}\\,(\\phi(x) - \\phi_c)^{t}}\n$$\nSimplifying the expression by canceling the common factor $\\sigma_0$ and combining the powers of $(\\phi(x) - \\phi_c)$:\n$$\n\\kappa(x) = \\frac{t}{\\phi(x) - \\phi_c}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytical expression for $\\kappa(x)$.\n\nTo analyze the behavior as $\\phi(x) \\to \\phi_{c}^{+}$, we examine the limit of the derived expression for $\\kappa(x)$:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\phi(x) \\to \\phi_{c}^{+}} \\kappa(x) = \\lim_{\\phi(x) \\to \\phi_{c}^{+}} \\frac{t}{\\phi(x) - \\phi_c}\n$$\nSince $t > 0$ and the denominator $(\\phi(x) - \\phi_c)$ approaches $0$ from the positive side, the limit diverges to positive infinity:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\phi(x) \\to \\phi_{c}^{+}} \\kappa(x) = +\\infty\n$$\nThis result signifies that the conductivity becomes infinitely sensitive to infinitesimal changes in the conductive additive volume fraction as the system approaches the critical percolation threshold, a hallmark of critical phenomena.\n\n**Task 3: Specialization for the Graded Profile $\\phi(x) = \\phi_c + a\\,x^{\\beta}$**\n\nWe are given the specific graded profile $\\phi(x) = \\phi_c + a\\,x^{\\beta}$ with $a > 0$ and $\\beta > 0$. We substitute this into our general expression for $\\kappa(x)$:\n$$\n\\kappa(x) = \\frac{t}{\\phi(x) - \\phi_c} = \\frac{t}{(\\phi_c + a\\,x^{\\beta}) - \\phi_c}\n$$\nThe $\\phi_c$ terms in the denominator cancel, leading to the simplified expression:\n$$\n\\kappa(x) = \\frac{t}{a\\,x^{\\beta}}\n$$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the logarithmic sensitivity for the given graded profile. We must confirm it is dimensionless as requested. The volume fraction $\\phi(x)$ is dimensionless. In the relation $\\phi(x) - \\phi_c = a\\,x^{\\beta}$, the left side is dimensionless. Therefore, the term $a\\,x^{\\beta}$ must be dimensionless. Since $x$ has dimensions of length, the constant $a$ must have dimensions of inverse length to the power of $\\beta$. The exponent $t$ is dimensionless. Consequently, the expression for $\\kappa(x)$ has dimensions of $[\\text{dimensionless}] / ([\\text{length}]^{-\\beta} \\cdot [\\text{length}]^{\\beta}) = [\\text{dimensionless}]$. The expression is dimensionally consistent.",

The derivation will proceed by first establishing a relationship for the specific surface area, $a(x)$, based on the provided particle size distribution, and then using the given definition $\\kappa(x) = a(x)k^{\\mathrm{surf}}$.\n\nLet us consider a differential volume element of the electrode, $dV_{\\mathrm{el}}$, at position $x$. The specific surface area $a(x)$ is the total surface area of the solid particles within this volume, $dA_{\\mathrm{part}}$, divided by the volume element itself: $a(x) = dA_{\\mathrm{part}} / dV_{\\mathrm{el}}$. Similarly, the solid volume fraction, $\\phi_s$, is the total volume of the solid particles, $dV_{\\mathrm{part}}$, divided by the electrode volume element: $\\phi_s = dV_{\\mathrm{part}} / dV_{\\mathrm{el}}$.\n\nWe introduce the function $n(r,x)dr$, which represents the number of spherical particles with radii in the interval $[r, r+dr]$ per unit volume of the electrode at position $x$. The volume of a single spherical particle of radius $r$ is $V_p(r) = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, and its surface area is $A_p(r) = 4\\pi r^2$.\n\nUsing these definitions, we can express $\\phi_s$ and $a(x)$ as integrals over the particle size distribution:\n$$\n\\phi_s = \\int_0^\\infty n(r,x) V_p(r) dr = \\int_0^\\infty n(r,x) \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\\right) dr\n$$\n$$\na(x) = \\int_0^\\infty n(r,x) A_p(r) dr = \\int_0^\\infty n(r,x) \\left(4\\pi r^2\\right) dr\n$$\nThe problem provides the number-based probability density function $f_N(r|x)$, which describes the probability of a randomly selected particle at position $x$ having a radius $r$. This PDF is related to $n(r,x)$ by a normalization constant, $N_V(x)$, which is the total number of particles per unit electrode volume at position $x$.

The problem specifies this constant current density is $I$, so $j_{e}(x) = I$.\n\nCombining these two equations, we have:\n$$ I = -\\kappa_{\\text{eff}}(x) \\frac{d\\phi_e}{dx} $$\nWe are given the expression for the effective conductivity:\n$$ \\kappa_{\\text{eff}}(x) = \\kappa_{0}\\left(1 + \\alpha \\frac{x}{L}\\right) $$\nSubstituting this into the equation gives:\n$$ I = -\\kappa_{0}\\left(1 + \\alpha \\frac{x}{L}\\right) \\frac{d\\phi_e}{dx} $$\nTo find the potential drop across the electrode, we first solve for the potential gradient, $\\frac{d\\phi_e}{dx}$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\phi_e}{dx} = -\\frac{I}{\\kappa_{0}\\left(1 + \\alpha \\frac{x}{L}\\right)} $$\nThe total change in potential from $x=0$ to $x=L$ is found by integrating this expression over the domain:\n$$ \\phi_e(L) - \\phi_e(0) = \\int_0^L \\frac{d\\phi_e}{dx} dx = \\int_0^L -\\frac{I}{\\kappa_{0}\\left(1 + \\alpha \\frac{x}{L}\\right)} dx $$\n$$ \\phi_e(L) - \\phi_e(0) = -\\frac{I}{\\kappa_{0}} \\int_0^L \\frac{1}{1 + \\alpha \\frac{x}{L}} dx $$\nTo solve the integral, we perform a substitution. Let $u = 1 + \\alpha \\frac{x}{L}$. Then $du = \\frac{\\alpha}{L} dx$, which gives $dx = \\frac{L}{\\alpha} du$. The limits of integration become $u(0) = 1$ and $u(L) = 1 + \\alpha$. This substitution is valid for $\\alpha \\neq 0$.\nThe integral becomes:\n$$ \\int_1^{1+\\alpha} \\frac{1}{u} \\left(\\frac{L}{\\alpha}\\right) du = \\frac{L}{\\alpha} \\left[ \\ln|u| \\right]_1^{1+\\alpha} = \\frac{L}{\\alpha} (\\ln|1+\\alpha| - \\ln(1)) $$\nSince the problem states $\\alpha > -1$, the term $1+\\alpha$ is always positive, so we can remove the absolute value. As $\\ln(1)=0$, the integral evaluates to $\\frac{L}{\\alpha}\\ln(1+\\alpha)$.\n\nSubstituting this result back:\n$$ \\phi_e(L) - \\phi_e(0) = -\\frac{I}{\\kappa_{0}} \\left( \\frac{L}{\\alpha} \\ln(1+\\alpha) \\right) $$\nThe problem defines the potential drop $\\Delta \\phi_{e}$ as the magnitude of the potential decrease from $x=0$ to $x=L$. Since $I>0$, $\\kappa_0>0$ and $\\frac{\\ln(1+\\alpha)}{\\alpha} > 0$ for $\\alpha > -1$ and $\\alpha \\neq 0$, the right-hand side is negative, meaning $\\phi_e(L) < \\phi_e(0)$. The potential decrease is $\\phi_e(0) - \\phi_e(L)$, which is a positive quantity.\n$$ \\Delta \\phi_{e} = \\phi_e(0) - \\phi_e(L) = -(\\phi_e(L) - \\phi_e(0)) = \\frac{IL}{\\kappa_{0}} \\frac{\\ln(1+\\alpha)}{\\alpha} $$\nFor the special case of a homogeneous electrode where $\\alpha=0$, the integral is $\\int_0^L 1 dx = L$. The potential drop is $\\Delta\\phi_e = \\frac{IL}{\\kappa_0}$. We can verify that our derived expression approaches this limit as $\\alpha \\to 0$ using L'Hôpital's rule:\n$$ \\lim_{\\alpha \\to 0} \\frac{\\ln(1+\\alpha)}{\\alpha} = \\lim_{\\alpha \\to 0} \\frac{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha}}{1} = 1 $$\nThus, the expression is valid for all $\\alpha > -1$.\n\n### Discussion on the Role of the Grading Parameter $\\alpha$\n\nThe problem asks for a discussion of how $\\alpha$ modifies the spatial distributions of $j_{e}(x)$ and the electric field $E_{e}(x) = -\\frac{d\\phi_e}{dx}$.\n\n**Case (a): Prescribed Uniform Current Density $I$**\n\nThis is the scenario analyzed in the derivation above.\n-   **Current Density $j_{e}(x)$:** Based on the steady-state charge conservation law in one dimension with no sources/sinks ($\\frac{dj_{e}}{dx} = 0$), the current density $j_{e}(x)$ must be spatially uniform. In this galvanostatic case, $j_{e}(x) = I$. The distribution of current density is therefore **uniform and independent of the grading parameter $\\alpha$**.\n-   **Electric Field $E_{e}(x)$:** The electric field is related to the current density by Ohm's law: $j_{e}(x) = \\kappa_{\\text{eff}}(x) E_{e}(x)$. Solving for the field gives:\n    $$ E_{e}(x) = \\frac{j_{e}(x)}{\\kappa_{\\text{eff}}(x)} = \\frac{I}{\\kappa_{0}\\left(1 + \\alpha \\frac{x}{L}\\right)} $$\n    The spatial distribution of the electric field is strongly dependent on $\\alpha$:\n    -   If $\\alpha = 0$ (uniform electrode), $E_{e}(x) = \\frac{I}{\\kappa_{0}}$, which is a **uniform electric field**.\n    -   If $\\alpha > 0$ (conductivity increases towards $x=L$), the denominator increases with $x$, causing the electric field $E_{e}(x)$ to **decrease** across the electrode from the separator to the current collector.\n    -   If $-1  \\alpha  0$ (conductivity decreases towards $x=L$), the denominator decreases with $x$, causing the electric field $E_{e}(x)$ to **increase** across the electrode.\n    In summary, for a given constant current, a non-zero $\\alpha$ creates a non-uniform electric field that is inversely proportional to the local conductivity.\n\n**Case (b): Prescribed Uniform Potential Gradient**\n\nThis represents a different physical constraint. A uniform potential gradient, $\\frac{d\\phi_e}{dx} = -E_0$ (where $E_0$ is a constant), implies a uniform electric field $E_e(x) = E_0$.\n-   **Electric Field $E_{e}(x)$:** By the definition of this scenario, the electric field is **uniform and independent of $\\alpha$**.\n-   **Current Density $j_{e}(x)$:** The current density is now position-dependent, as given by Ohm's law:\n    $$ j_{e}(x) = \\kappa_{\\text{eff}}(x) E_{e}(x) = \\kappa_{0}\\left(1 + \\alpha \\frac{x}{L}\\right) E_0 $$\n    The behavior of $j_{e}(x)$ now mirrors that of the conductivity profile:\n    -   If $\\alpha = 0$, $j_{e}(x) = \\kappa_0 E_0$, which is uniform.\n    -   If $\\alpha \\neq 0$, $j_{e}(x)$ is **linearly dependent on position $x$**. It increases linearly for $\\alpha > 0$ and decreases linearly for $\\alpha  0$.\n\n**Differences in Behavior:**\nThe crucial difference between these two scenarios lies in their consistency with the initial physical assumptions.\n-   Scenario (a) (prescribed $I$) is physically self-consistent with the assumption of no local current sources or sinks, as it satisfies $\\frac{dj_{e}}{dx} = 0$.\n-   Scenario (b) (prescribed uniform $E_e$), however, leads to a non-uniform current density $j_e(x)$ whenever $\\alpha \\neq 0$. The derivative is $\\frac{dj_{e}}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left[\\kappa_{0} E_0 \\left(1 + \\alpha \\frac{x}{L}\\right)\\right] = \\frac{\\kappa_{0} E_0 \\alpha}{L}$. Since this is non-zero, it violates the charge conservation condition $\\frac{dj_{e}}{dx} = 0$ for a system with no sources or sinks. This scenario is only physically possible if there is a distributed source/sink of current, $Q(x) = \\frac{dj_e}{dx}$, such as from an electrochemical reaction, which contradicts a core premise of the first part of the problem.\n\nTherefore, under the initial problem's assumptions, only a uniform current density is possible, which in turn necessitates a non-uniform electric field in a graded-conductivity medium.",
