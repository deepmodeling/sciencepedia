The physical quantities are energy density $\\rho_{E}$ in $\\mathrm{Wh\\,kg^{-1}}$ and cycle life $L$ in cycles. Because the canonical NSGA-II formulation treats objectives as minimization, the group uses the objective mapping $f_{1}=-\\rho_{E}$ and $f_{2}=-L$. Five candidate designs produce the following objective vectors $(f_{1},f_{2})$:\n- $x^{(1)}: ( -240 , -1500 )$\n- $x^{(2)}: ( -220 , -2000 )$\n- $x^{(3)}: ( -260 , -1200 )$\n- $x^{(4)}: ( -230 , -1600 )$\n- $x^{(5)}: ( -240 , -2100 )$\n\nUsing the formal definition of Pareto dominance for minimization in multi-objective optimization, determine all pairwise dominance relations among $\\{x^{(i)}\\}_{i=1}^{5}$ and identify the non-dominated set (the first Pareto front).

            "solution": "The problem requires the identification of pairwise dominance relations and the determination of the non-dominated set (the first Pareto front) for a given set of five candidate solutions in a multi-objective optimization problem. The final goal is to report the cardinality of this non-dominated set.\n\nThe optimization problem involves maximizing energy density, $\\rho_{E}$, and cycle life, $L$. Within the NSGA-II framework, which is formulated for minimization, this is correctly transformed by defining the objective functions as $f_{1}=-\\rho_{E}$ and $f_{2}=-L$. Minimizing $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$ is equivalent to maximizing $\\rho_{E}$ and $L$.\n\nThe core of the analysis rests on the concept of Pareto dominance for minimization. A solution $x^{(a)}$ with an objective vector $f^{(a)} = (f_{1}^{(a)}, f_{2}^{(a)})$ is said to dominate another solution $x^{(b)}$ with an objective vector $f^{(b)} = (f_{1}^{(b)}, f_{2}^{(b)})$, denoted as $x^{(a)} \\prec x^{(b)}$, if and only if two conditions are met:\n1.  The objective vector of $x^{(a)}$ is no worse than that of $x^{(b)}$ in all objectives: $f_{i}^{(a)} \\le f_{i}^{(b)}$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$.\n2.  The objective vector of $x^{(a)}$ is strictly better than that of $x^{(b)}$ in at least one objective: $f_{j}^{(a)}  f_{j}^{(b)}$ for at least one $j \\in \\{1, 2\\}$.\n\nThe five candidate designs and their corresponding objective vectors $(f_{1}, f_{2})$ are given as:\n- $x^{(1)}: f^{(1)} = ( -240 , -1500 )$\n- $x^{(2)}: f^{(2)} = ( -220 , -2000 )$\n- $x^{(3)}: f^{(3)} = ( -260 , -1200 )$\n- $x^{(4)}: f^{(4)} = ( -230 , -1600 )$\n- $x^{(5)}: f^{(5)} = ( -240 , -2100 )$\n\nA solution is part of the non-dominated set if no other solution in the population dominates it. We will now systematically analyze each solution to determine if it is dominated.\n\n1.  **Analysis of $x^{(1)}$ with $f^{(1)} = ( -240 , -1500 )$**:\n    We search for any solution $x^{(i)}$ that dominates $x^{(1)}$. Let us compare $x^{(1)}$ with $x^{(5)}$.\n    - For $x^{(5)}$, $f^{(5)} = ( -240 , -2100 )$.\n    - We check the conditions for $x^{(5)} \\prec x^{(1)}$:\n        - $f_{1}^{(5)} \\le f_{1}^{(1)} \\implies -240 \\le -240$ (True).\n        - $f_{2}^{(5)} \\le f_{2}^{(1)} \\implies -2100 \\le -1500$ (True).\n        - At least one inequality must be strict: $f_{2}^{(5)}  f_{2}^{(1)}$ is true.\n    - Since both conditions are satisfied, $x^{(5)}$ dominates $x^{(1)}$. Therefore, $x^{(1)}$ is a dominated solution.\n\n2.  **Analysis of $x^{(2)}$ with $f^{(2)} = ( -220 , -2000 )$**:\n    We compare $x^{(2)}$ with $x^{(5)}$.\n    - For $x^{(5)}$, $f^{(5)} = ( -240 , -2100 )$.\n    - We check the conditions for $x^{(5)} \\prec x^{(2)}$:\n        - $f_{1}^{(5)} \\le f_{1}^{(2)} \\implies -240 \\le -220$ (True).\n        - $f_{2}^{(5)} \\le f_{2}^{(2)} \\implies -2100 \\le -2000$ (True).\n        - Both inequalities are strict.\n    - Thus, $x^{(5)}$ dominates $x^{(2)}$. Therefore, $x^{(2)}$ is a dominated solution.\n\n3.  **Analysis of $x^{(3)}$ with $f^{(3)} = ( -260 , -1200 )$**:\n    For another solution $x^{(i)}$ to dominate $x^{(3)}$, its objective vector $f^{(i)}$ must satisfy $f_{1}^{(i)} \\le -260$ and $f_{2}^{(i)} \\le -1200$, with at least one strict inequality.\n    - We inspect the $f_{1}$ values of all other solutions: $f_{1}^{(1)}=-240$, $f_{1}^{(2)}=-220$, $f_{1}^{(4)}=-230$, $f_{1}^{(5)}=-240$.\n    - None of these values are less than or equal to $-260$. Since the condition $f_{1}^{(i)} \\le f_{1}^{(3)}$ is not met for any $i \\neq 3$, no other solution can dominate $x^{(3)}$. Therefore, $x^{(3)}$ is a non-dominated solution.\n\n4.  **Analysis of $x^{(4)}$ with $f^{(4)} = ( -230 , -1600 )$**:\n    We compare $x^{(4)}$ with $x^{(5)}$.\n    - For $x^{(5)}$, $f^{(5)} = ( -240 , -2100 )$.\n    - We check the conditions for $x^{(5)} \\prec x^{(4)}$:\n        - $f_{1}^{(5)} \\le f_{1}^{(4)} \\implies -240 \\le -230$ (True).\n        - $f_{2}^{(5)} \\le f_{2}^{(4)} \\implies -2100 \\le -1600$ (True).\n        - Both inequalities are strict.\n    - Thus, $x^{(5)}$ dominates $x^{(4)}$. Therefore, $x^{(4)}$ is a dominated solution.\n\n5.  **Analysis of $x^{(5)}$ with $f^{(5)} = ( -240 , -2100 )$**:\n    For another solution $x^{(i)}$ to dominate $x^{(5)}$, its objective vector $f^{(i)}$ must satisfy $f_{1}^{(i)} \\le -240$ and $f_{2}^{(i)} \\le -2100$, with at least one strict inequality.\n    - We inspect solutions that satisfy $f_{1}^{(i)} \\le -240$: $x^{(1)}$ (with $f_1 = -240$) and $x^{(3)}$ (with $f_1 = -260$).\n    - Comparing with $x^{(1)}$: $f^{(1)} = (-240, -1500)$. The condition $f_{2}^{(1)} \\le f_{2}^{(5)}$ is $-1500 \\le -2100$, which is false.\n    - Comparing with $x^{(3)}$: $f^{(3)} = (-260, -1200)$. The condition $f_{2}^{(3)} \\le f_{2}^{(5)}$ is $-1200 \\le -2100$, which is false.\n    - Since no other solution $x^{(i)}$ satisfies both components of the dominance condition, $x^{(5)}$ is not dominated. Therefore, $x^{(5)}$ is a non-dominated solution.\n\nSummary of pairwise dominance relations:\n- $x^{(5)} \\prec x^{(1)}$\n- $x^{(5)} \\prec x^{(2)}$\n- $x^{(5)} \\prec x^{(4)}$\nNo other dominance relations exist among the pairs.\n\nThe non-dominated set, also known as the first Pareto front, consists of all solutions that are not dominated by any other solution. Based on the analysis above, the dominated solutions are $\\{x^{(1)}, x^{(2)}, x^{(4)}\\}$ and the non-dominated solutions are $\\{x^{(3)}, x^{(5)}\\}$.\n\nThe non-dominated set is $\\{x^{(3)}, x^{(5)}\\}$.\n\nThe cardinality of a set is the number of elements in the set. The non-dominated set has two elements. Therefore, its cardinality is $2$.",

The initial value was $n_{x_1}=1$, so it becomes $n_{x_1} = 1-1 = 0$. Since $n_{x_1}$ is now $0$, we add $x_{1}$ to $F_{2}$.\n- For $p = x_{8} \\in F_{1}$, its dominated set is $S_{x_8} = \\{x_3\\}$. We decrement $n_{x_3}$. The initial value was $n_{x_3}=1$, so it becomes $n_{x_3} = 1-1 = 0$. Since $n_{x_3}$ is now $0$, we add $x_{3}$ to $F_{2}$.\n- The other solutions in $F_{1}$ ($x_{2}, x_{4}, x_{5}, x_{7}$) have empty dominated sets, so they do not affect the counts of other solutions.\n\nThe second front is therefore $F_{2} = \\{x_1, x_3\\}$.\nFor each solution $x_{i} \\in F_{2}$, we assign the rank $r(x_{i}) = 2$.\nSo, $r(x_1)=2$ and $r(x_3)=2$.\n\n**Subsequent Fronts:**\nWe would now form $F_{3}$ by iterating through solutions in $F_{2}$.
