It is a network of particles where interfacial contact resistance at particle-particle junctions, induced by the binder, must be considered. The problem specifies that this contact resistance adds in series to the bulk resistance of the additive material. The total effective resistivity of the conductive additive phase, $\\rho_c$, is therefore the sum of the bulk resistivity, $\\rho_p$, and an effective resistivity arising from the contacts, $\\rho_{contacts}$.\n\n$$ \\rho_c = \\rho_p + \\rho_{contacts} $$\n\nThe bulk resistivity $\\rho_p$ is the reciprocal of the bulk conductivity $\\sigma_p$.\n$$ \\rho_p = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_p} $$\n\nThe contribution from contact resistance, $\\rho_{contacts}$, is modeled based on the provided parameters. The binder-induced interfacial contact resistivity, $r_c$, has units of $\\Omega\\cdot\\text{m}^2$. To convert this into a macroscopic resistivity contribution (units of $\\Omega\\cdot\\text{m}$), we must consider the density of contacts along the path of current flow. The problem states that the parameter $\\alpha$ \"quantifies, in a homogenized sense, the number of effective contacts per unit transport length,\" and specifies that the contact resistance should be treated as a series addition. The number of contacts per unit length is thus modeled as $\\frac{\\alpha}{d}$, where $d$ is the particle diameter. This implies that the added resistivity from contacts is the product of the resistance per contact and the number of contacts per unit length, normalized correctly. A dimensionally consistent model derived from this concept is $\\rho_{contacts} = \\alpha \\frac{r_c}{d}$. Although a more complex model for a 3D network might suggest that a higher coordination number decreases resistivity by providing parallel pathways, the problem explicitly directs a series addition model where $\\alpha$ scales the number of series resistances per unit length.

If $n$ is the number density of rods and $v_{\\mathrm{rod}}$ is the volume of a single rod, then the volume fraction is given by their product:\n$$\n\\phi = n v_{\\mathrm{rod}}\n$$\nAt the percolation threshold, the number density is the critical number density, $n_{\\mathrm{c}}$, and the volume fraction is the critical volume fraction, $\\phi_{\\mathrm{c}}$. Thus, we can express the critical number density as:\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\frac{\\phi_{\\mathrm{c}}}{v_{\\mathrm{rod}}}\n$$\nThe problem states the percolation condition is $n \\langle V_{\\mathrm{ex}}^{\\mathrm{conn}} \\rangle = 1$. At the threshold, this becomes:\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{c}} \\langle V_{\\mathrm{ex}}^{\\mathrm{conn}} \\rangle = 1\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $n_{\\mathrm{c}}$ into the percolation condition gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\phi_{\\mathrm{c}}}{v_{\\mathrm{rod}}} \\langle V_{\\mathrm{ex}}^{\\mathrm{conn}} \\rangle = 1\n$$\nSolving for $\\phi_{\\mathrm{c}}$ yields:\n$$\n\\phi_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{rod}}}{\\langle V_{\\mathrm{ex}}^{\\mathrm{conn}} \\rangle}\n$$\nThe next step is to determine the expressions for the numerator, $v_{\\mathrm{rod}}$, and the denominator, $\\langle V_{\\mathrm{ex}}^{\\mathrm{conn}} \\rangle$, using the information provided.\n\nThe volume of a single rod is given as:\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{rod}} \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{4} D^{2} L\n$$\nThe orientationally averaged connectedness excluded volume, $\\langle V_{\\mathrm{ex}}^{\\mathrm{conn}} \\rangle$, is the average of $V_{\\mathrm{ex}}^{\\mathrm{conn}}(\\gamma)$ over all possible relative orientations of two rods. The problem provides the expression for $V_{\\mathrm{ex}}^{\\mathrm{conn}}(\\gamma)$:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{ex}}^{\\mathrm{conn}}(\\gamma) \\approx 2 L^{2} D_{\\mathrm{c}} \\sin \\gamma\n$$\nAveraging this expression, and noting that $L$ and $D_{\\mathrm{c}}$ are constants for the rod population, we get:\n$$\n\\langle V_{\\mathrm{ex}}^{\\mathrm{conn}} \\rangle = \\langle 2 L^{2} D_{\\mathrm{c}} \\sin \\gamma \\rangle = 2 L^{2} D_{\\mathrm{c}} \\langle \\sin \\gamma \\rangle\n$$\nThe problem provides a second-moment closure approximation for $\\langle \\sin \\gamma \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\langle \\sin \\gamma \\rangle \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\langle \\cos^{2} \\gamma \\rangle}\n$$\nAnd an expression for $\\langle \\cos^{2} \\gamma \\rangle$ in terms of the nematic order parameter $S$:\n$$\n\\langle \\cos^{2} \\gamma \\rangle = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{3} S^{2}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the approximation for $\\langle \\sin \\gamma \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\langle \\sin \\gamma \\rangle \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{3} S^{2}\\right)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3} - \\frac{2}{3} S^{2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}(1 - S^{2})}\n$$\nNow, substitute this result back into the expression for $\\langle V_{\\mathrm{ex}}^{\\mathrm{conn}} \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\langle V_{\\mathrm{ex}}^{\\mathrm{conn}} \\rangle \\approx 2 L^{2} D_{\\mathrm{c}} \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}(1 - S^{2})}\n$$\nWe now have expressions for both $v_{\\mathrm{rod}}$ and $\\langle V_{\\mathrm{ex}}^{\\mathrm{conn}} \\rangle$. We can substitute them into the equation for $\\phi_{\\mathrm{c}}$:\n$$\n\\phi_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{4} D^{2} L}{2 L^{2} D_{\\mathrm{c}} \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}(1 - S^{2})}}\n$$\nWe proceed to simplify this expression.\n$$\n\\phi_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\frac{\\pi D^{2} L}{8 L^{2} D_{\\mathrm{c}} \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}(1 - S^{2})}} = \\frac{\\pi D^{2}}{8 L D_{\\mathrm{c}} \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}(1 - S^{2})}}\n$$\nThe final answer must be in terms of $\\alpha$, $D$, $\\chi$, and $S$. We use the given definitions $\\alpha = L/D$ (which implies $L = \\alpha D$) and $D_{\\mathrm{c}} = D + 2\\chi$. Substituting these into the expression for $\\phi_{\\mathrm{c}}$:\n$$\n\\phi_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\frac{\\pi D^{2}}{8 (\\alpha D) (D + 2\\chi) \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}(1 - S^{2})}}\n$$\nSimplifying by canceling a factor of $D$:\n$$\n\\phi_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\frac{\\pi D}{8 \\alpha (D + 2\\chi) \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}(1 - S^{2})}}\n$$\nTo obtain a more refined final form, we can simplify the constant coefficients:\n$$\n\\phi_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\frac{\\pi D}{8 \\alpha (D + 2\\chi) \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{3}} \\sqrt{1 - S^{2}}} = \\frac{\\pi \\sqrt{3} D}{8 \\sqrt{2} \\alpha (D + 2\\chi) \\sqrt{1 - S^{2}}}\n$$\nRationalizing the denominator by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{2}$:\n$$\n\\phi_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\frac{\\pi \\sqrt{3} \\sqrt{2} D}{8 \\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{2} \\alpha (D + 2\\chi) \\sqrt{1 - S^{2}}} = \\frac{\\pi \\sqrt{6} D}{16 \\alpha (D + 2\\chi) \\sqrt{1 - S^{2}}}\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytic expression for the percolation threshold solid volume fraction $\\phi_{\\mathrm{c}}$ in terms of the specified variables $\\alpha$, $D$, $\\chi$, and $S$.",
