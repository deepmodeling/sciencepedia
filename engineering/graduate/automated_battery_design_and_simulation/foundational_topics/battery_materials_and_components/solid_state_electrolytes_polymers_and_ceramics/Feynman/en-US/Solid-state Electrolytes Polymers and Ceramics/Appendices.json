It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, presenting a standard problem in the analysis of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data for a solid-state electrolyte. All necessary parameters and conditions are provided, and no contradictions or ambiguities are present.\n\nThe problem describes the impedance response of a sintered ceramic electrolyte, which can be modeled by an equivalent circuit consisting of several elements in series. The description fits a model where a series resistance ($R_s$) is followed by two parallel resistor-capacitor ($RC$) circuits. The first $RC$ circuit represents the bulk material properties ($R_{\\mathrm{bulk}}$, $C_{\\mathrm{bulk}}$), and the second represents the grain boundary properties ($R_{\\mathrm{gb}}$, $C_{\\mathrm{gb}}$). The total impedance $Z$ is thus given by $Z = R_s + Z_{\\mathrm{bulk}} + Z_{\\mathrm{gb}}$.\n\nIn a Nyquist plot ($Z''$ vs $Z'$), such a circuit produces a series of semicircles. The real-axis ($Z'$) intercepts correspond to cumulative resistances.\n1. The high-frequency intercept corresponds to the series resistance, $R_s$, which includes contact and lead resistance. This is given as $Z'_{\\omega \\to \\infty} = R_s = 12.0$ $\\Omega$.\n2. The end of the first semicircle (representing the bulk response) intercepts the real axis at $R_s + R_{\\mathrm{bulk}}$.

This is given as the point before any low-frequency diffusional tail, $332.0$ $\\Omega$.\n\nUsing these intercepts, we can calculate the bulk resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{bulk}}$, and the grain boundary resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{gb}}$.\n\nThe bulk resistance is the difference between the end of the first semicircle and the high-frequency intercept:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{bulk}} = (R_s + R_{\\mathrm{bulk}}) - R_s = 92.0\\ \\Omega - 12.0\\ \\Omega = 80.0\\ \\Omega$$\n\nThe grain boundary resistance is the difference between the end of the second semicircle and the end of the first semicircle:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{gb}} = (R_s + R_{\\mathrm{bulk}} + R_{\\mathrm{gb}}) - (R_s + R_{\\mathrm{bulk}}) = 332.0\\ \\Omega - 92.0\\ \\Omega = 240.0\\ \\Omega$$\n\nNext, we convert these resistances into conductivities ($\\sigma$).
