The physical constants and material properties are realistic. No flaws, ambiguities, or contradictions are present. We may therefore proceed with a formal derivation and solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the change in the molar Born solvation free energy, $\\Delta \\Delta G$, for a monovalent cation $\\text{Li}^{+}$ when moved from a solvent of ethylene carbonate (EC) to 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME). We begin by deriving the expression for the Born solvation free energy from first principles.\n\nThe Born model treats the ion as a rigid, spherical conductor of radius $r_{\\mathrm{B}}$ and charge $q$, and the solvent as a structureless continuum with relative permittivity $\\varepsilon_r$. The electrostatic self-energy of the ion is the work required to charge the sphere from an uncharged state to its final charge $q$.\n\nFirst, consider charging the sphere in a vacuum, where the permittivity is $\\varepsilon_0$. The electrostatic potential $\\phi(q')$ on the surface of a sphere of radius $r_{\\mathrm{B}}$ carrying a charge $q'$ is given by Gauss's law:\n$$ \\phi(q') = \\frac{q'}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r_{\\mathrm{B}}} $$\nThe incremental work, $dW$, required to bring an infinitesimal charge $dq'$ from infinity to the surface of this sphere is:\n$$ dW = \\phi(q') dq' = \\frac{q'}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r_{\\mathrm{B}}} dq' $$\nThe total work to charge the sphere from $q' = 0$ to $q' = q$, which represents the electrostatic self-energy in vacuum, $W_{\\mathrm{vac}}$, is the integral of this expression:\n$$ W_{\\mathrm{vac}} = \\int_0^q \\frac{q'}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r_{\\mathrm{B}}} dq' = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r_{\\mathrm{B}}} \\int_0^q q' dq' = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r_{\\mathrm{B}}} \\left[ \\frac{q'^2}{2} \\right]_0^q = \\frac{q^2}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r_{\\mathrm{B}}} $$\nNext, we perform the same charging process, but with the sphere immersed in a dielectric medium of relative permittivity $\\varepsilon_r$. The absolute permittivity of the medium is $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0$. The derivation is identical, with $\\varepsilon_0$ replaced by $\\varepsilon$:\n$$ W_{\\mathrm{med}} = \\frac{q^2}{8\\pi\\varepsilon r_{\\mathrm{B}}} = \\frac{q^2}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0 r_{\\mathrm{B}}} $$\nThe Born solvation free energy, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{Born}}$, is defined as the work of transferring the ion from vacuum to the solvent. This corresponds to the difference between the electrostatic self-energy in the medium and in vacuum:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{Born}} = W_{\\mathrm{med}} - W_{\\mathrm{vac}} = \\frac{q^2}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0 r_{\\mathrm{B}}} - \\frac{q^2}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r_{\\mathrm{B}}} $$\nFactoring out the common terms yields the Born equation for a single ion:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{Born}} = \\frac{q^2}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r_{\\mathrm{B}}} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_r} - 1 \\right) $$\nSince $\\varepsilon_r > 1$ for any material medium, the solvation free energy is always negative, indicating a spontaneous process.\n\nThe problem asks for the *molar* change in energy.

It is objective.\n-   **No other flaws detected**: The problem is complete, consistent, realistic, and formally structured.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation begins from the fundamental principles as requested. The constitutive relation for ionic conduction in an isotropic medium is the local form of Ohm's law, which states that the current density vector $\\vec{J}$ is proportional to the electric field vector $\\vec{E}$:\n$$\n\\vec{J} = \\kappa \\vec{E}\n$$\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the ionic conductivity of the medium.\n\nFor a parallel-plate cell with a uniform electric field directed along the axis connecting the electrodes (let's call this the $x$-axis), the vector relation simplifies to a scalar one: $J = \\kappa E$. The problem assumes negligible fringing fields, justifying this one-dimensional approximation.\n\nThe electric field $E$ is related to the potential difference $\\Delta V$ across the electrolyte of thickness $L$ by $E = \\frac{\\Delta V}{L}$, assuming a uniform field. The total current $I$ flowing through the electrolyte is the product of the current density $J$ and the electrode area $A$: $I = J A$.\n\nThe resistance of the electrolyte, $R_{el}$, is defined by Ohm's law as the ratio of the potential difference across it to the current flowing through it:\n$$\nR_{el} = \\frac{\\Delta V}{I}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\Delta V$ and $I$ in terms of $E$ and $J$:\n$$\nR_{el} = \\frac{E L}{J A}\n$$\nUsing the constitutive relation $J = \\kappa E$, we can write $\\frac{E}{J} = \\frac{1}{\\kappa}$. Substituting this into the expression for $R_{el}$ yields the well-known formula for the resistance of a uniform conductor:\n$$\nR_{el} = \\frac{L}{\\kappa A}\n$$\nThe problem states that in an EIS measurement, the high-frequency real-axis intercept, $Z'_{hf}$, represents the sum of all ohmic resistances in series. In this symmetric cell, these resistances are the bulk electrolyte resistance $R_{el}$ and the frequency-independent contact and wiring resistance $R_c$. The impedance of the interfacial parallel RC/CPE elements approaches zero at infinite frequency, justifying their exclusion from $Z'_{hf}$.\nThus, the total measured high-frequency resistance is:\n$$\nZ'_{hf} = R_{el} + R_c = \\frac{L}{\\kappa A} + R_c\n$$\nTwo measurements are performed with different spacer thicknesses, $L_1$ and $L_2$. The corresponding measured high-frequency resistances are $Z'_{hf,1}$ and $Z'_{hf,2}$. The conductivity $\\kappa$, area $A$, and contact resistance $R_c$ are constant for both experiments. This gives a system of two linear equations:\n1.  For thickness $L_1$: $Z'_{hf,1} = \\frac{L_1}{\\kappa A} + R_c$\n2.  For thickness $L_2$: $Z'_{hf,2} = \\frac{L_2}{\\kappa A} + R_c$\n\nTo eliminate the unknown contact resistance $R_c$, we subtract the first equation from the second:\n$$\nZ'_{hf,2} - Z'_{hf,1} = \\left(\\frac{L_2}{\\kappa A} + R_c\\right) - \\left(\\frac{L_1}{\\kappa A} + R_c\\right)\n$$\n$$\nZ'_{hf,2} - Z'_{hf,1} = \\frac{L_2}{\\kappa A} - \\frac{L_1}{\\kappa A} = \\frac{L_2 - L_1}{\\kappa A}\n$$\nThis equation can now be rearranged to solve for the ionic conductivity $\\kappa$:\n$$\n\\kappa = \\frac{L_2 - L_1}{A (Z'_{hf,2} - Z'_{hf,1})}\n$$\nThis is the required analytical expression for $\\kappa$ that is independent of $R_c$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the provided data:\n-   $A = 1.000 \\times 10^{-4}$ m$^2$\n-   $L_1 = 1.00 \\times 10^{-4}$ m\n-   $L_2 = 2.50 \\times 10^{-4}$ m\n-   $Z'_{hf,1} = 1.1333$ $\\Omega$\n-   $Z'_{hf,2} = 2.3833$ $\\Omega$\n\nFirst, calculate the differences:\n$$\n\\Delta L = L_2 - L_1 = (2.50 \\times 10^{-4} - 1.00 \\times 10^{-4}) \\, \\text{m} = 1.50 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{m}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta Z' = Z'_{hf,2} - Z'_{hf,1} = (2.3833 - 1.1333) \\, \\Omega = 1.2500 \\, \\Omega\n$$\nSubstitute these values into the expression for $\\kappa$:\n$$\n\\kappa = \\frac{1.50 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{m}}{(1.000 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{m}^2)(1.2500 \\, \\Omega)}\n$$\n$$\n\\kappa = \\frac{1.50}{1.000 \\times 1.2500} \\, \\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{m}^2 \\cdot \\Omega} = \\frac{1.50}{1.2500} \\, \\Omega^{-1} \\text{m}^{-1}\n$$\nThe unit $\\Omega^{-1}$ is the siemens ($S$).\n$$\n\\kappa = 1.2 \\, \\text{S m}^{-1}\n$$\nThe calculated value is exactly $1.2$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of key electrolyte properties as a function of cosolvent mole fraction, an explanation of the underlying physical trade-offs, and a computational implementation to quantify these effects. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and provides all necessary information for a complete solution.\n\n### Part 1: Derivations and Physical Mechanism\n\nThe objective is to derive expressions for the diffusion coefficients $D_+(x)$ and $D_-(x)$, the free-ion fraction $\\alpha(x)$, the ionic conductivity $\\kappa(x)$, and the cation transference number $t_+(x)$ based on the provided physical models.\n\nFirst, we establish the expressions for the mixture properties that depend on the cosolvent mole fraction $x$.\nThe mixture viscosity, $\\eta_{\\text{mix}}(x)$, is given by the Grunberg–Nissan equation:\n$$ \\ln \\eta_{\\text{mix}}(x) = x \\ln \\eta_1 + (1-x) \\ln \\eta_0 + G x (1-x) $$\n$$ \\eta_{\\text{mix}}(x) = \\exp\\left( x \\ln \\eta_1 + (1-x) \\ln \\eta_0 + G x (1-x) \\right) = \\eta_0^{1-x} \\eta_1^x e^{G x (1-x)} $$\nThe mixture relative permittivity, $\\varepsilon_r(x)$, follows a linear mixing rule:\n$$ \\varepsilon_r(x) = x \\varepsilon_{r1} + (1-x) \\varepsilon_{r0} $$\n\n**1. Ion Diffusion Coefficients $D_+(x)$ and $D_-(x)$**\n\nThe diffusion coefficient for ion species $i$ is given by a modified Stokes–Einstein relation, which incorporates both the bulk viscosity of the mixture and a first-order correction for specific solvation effects:\n$$ D_i(x) = \\dfrac{k_B T}{6 \\pi \\eta_{\\text{mix}}(x) r_i} \\left( 1 + \\beta_i x \\right) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\eta_{\\text{mix}}(x)$, we obtain the explicit dependence for the cation ($+$) and anion ($-$):\n$$ D_+(x) = \\dfrac{k_B T (1 + \\beta_+ x)}{6 \\pi r_+ \\exp\\left( x \\ln \\eta_1 + (1-x) \\ln \\eta_0 + G x (1-x) \\right)} $$\n$$ D_-(x) = \\dfrac{k_B T (1 + \\beta_- x)}{6 \\pi r_- \\exp\\left( x \\ln \\eta_1 + (1-x) \\ln \\eta_0 + G x (1-x) \\right)} $$\n\n**2. Free-Ion Fraction $\\alpha(x)$**\n\nThe free-ion fraction, $\\alpha(x)$, is determined by the equilibrium between free ions and ion pairs, governed by the association constant $K_{\\text{ip}}$. First, we find the dependence of $K_{\\text{ip}}$ on $x$ through the mixture's dielectric constant $\\varepsilon_r(x)$.\n$$ K_{\\text{ip}}(x) = K_{\\text{ref}} \\exp\\left( B \\left( \\dfrac{1}{\\varepsilon_r(x)} - \\dfrac{1}{\\varepsilon_{\\text{ref}}} \\right) \\right) $$\nSubstituting the linear mixing rule for $\\varepsilon_r(x)$:\n$$ K_{\\text{ip}}(x) = K_{\\text{ref}} \\exp\\left( B \\left( \\dfrac{1}{x \\varepsilon_{r1} + (1-x) \\varepsilon_{r0}} - \\dfrac{1}{\\varepsilon_{\\text{ref}}} \\right) \\right) $$\nThe free-ion fraction $\\alpha$ for a formal salt concentration $c_s$ is given by:\n$$ \\alpha(x) = \\dfrac{1}{1 + K_{\\text{ip}}(x) c_s} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $K_{\\text{ip}}(x)$:\n$$ \\alpha(x) = \\left( 1 + c_s K_{\\text{ref}} \\exp\\left( B \\left( \\dfrac{1}{x \\varepsilon_{r1} + (1-x) \\varepsilon_{r0}} - \\dfrac{1}{\\varepsilon_{\\text{ref}}} \\right) \\right) \\right)^{-1} $$\n\n**3. Ionic Conductivity $\\kappa(x)$**\n\nThe ionic conductivity for a $1:1$ electrolyte is given as $\\kappa(x) = \\dfrac{F^2}{R T} \\alpha(x) c_s \\left( D_+(x) + D_-(x) \\right)$. Substituting the derived expressions for $\\alpha(x)$, $D_+(x)$, and $D_-(x)$ yields the full expression for $\\kappa(x)$:\n$$ \\kappa(x) = \\dfrac{F^2 c_s}{R T} \\alpha(x) \\left( D_+(x) + D_-(x) \\right) $$\n$$ \\kappa(x) = \\dfrac{F^2 c_s}{R T} \\alpha(x) \\left( \\dfrac{k_B T (1 + \\beta_+ x)}{6 \\pi \\eta_{\\text{mix}}(x) r_+} + \\dfrac{k_B T (1 + \\beta_- x)}{6 \\pi \\eta_{\\text{mix}}(x) r_-} \\right) $$\nUsing the relation $R = N_A k_B$, where $N_A$ is the Avogadro constant, we can simplify the prefactor $\\frac{F^2 c_s k_B T}{R T} = \\frac{F^2 c_s k_B}{R} = \\frac{F^2 c_s}{N_A}$.\n$$ \\kappa(x) = \\dfrac{F^2 c_s}{N_A} \\dfrac{\\alpha(x)}{6 \\pi \\eta_{\\text{mix}}(x)} \\left( \\dfrac{1 + \\beta_+ x}{r_+} + \\dfrac{1 + \\beta_- x}{r_-} \\right) $$\nwhere $\\alpha(x)$ and $\\eta_{\\text{mix}}(x)$ are the functions of $x$ derived previously.\n\n**4. Cation Transference Number $t_+(x)$**\n\nFor a $1:1$ salt where free cation and anion concentrations are equal ($c_+ = c_- = \\alpha c_s$), the cation transference number simplifies to a ratio of diffusion coefficients:\n$$ t_+(x) = \\dfrac{D_+(x)}{D_+(x) + D_-(x)} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $D_+(x)$ and $D_-(x)$, the common factor $\\dfrac{k_B T}{6 \\pi \\eta_{\\text{mix}}(x)}$ cancels out:\n$$ t_+(x) = \\dfrac{\\dfrac{1 + \\beta_+ x}{r_+}}{\\dfrac{1 + \\beta_+ x}{r_+} + \\dfrac{1 + \\beta_- x}{r_-}} $$\n\n**5. Physical Mechanism of the Trade-off**\n\nThe simultaneous increase in conductivity $\\kappa$ and decrease in cation transference number $t_+$ upon adding a cosolvent arises from competing physical effects:\n- **Conductivity Increase:** The addition of the cosolvent, which has a significantly lower viscosity ($\\eta_1 < \\eta_0$), reduces the overall mixture viscosity $\\eta_{\\text{mix}}(x)$. According to the Stokes-Einstein relation, lower viscosity leads to higher ionic mobility ($D_i \\propto 1/\\eta_{\\text{mix}}$). This effect tends to increase conductivity. Conversely, the cosolvent also has a lower dielectric constant ($\\varepsilon_{r1} < \\varepsilon_{r0}$), which reduces the mixture's permittivity $\\varepsilon_r(x)$. A lower permittivity enhances electrostatic attraction between cations and anions, thereby increasing the ion-pairing association constant $K_{\\text{ip}}(x)$ and reducing the fraction of free charge carriers, $\\alpha(x)$. This effect tends to decrease conductivity. For the parameters given, the viscosity reduction is the dominant effect, causing a net increase in the product $\\alpha(x) (D_+(x) + D_-(x))$, leading to $\\kappa(x) > \\kappa(0)$ over a range of $x$.\n\n- **Transference Number Decrease:** The transference number $t_+(x)$ depends on the *ratio* of cation mobility to total ionic mobility. The parameters $\\beta_+$ and $\\beta_-$ model changes in the effective hydrodynamic radius due to preferential solvation. With $\\beta_- > \\beta_+$, the addition of the cosolvent enhances the mobility of the anion more significantly than that of the cation. This is reflected in the term $(1+\\beta_i x)$, which grows more rapidly for the anion. Consequently, the ratio $D_-(x)/D_+(x) = \\frac{r_+(1+\\beta_- x)}{r_-(1+\\beta_+ x)}$ increases as $x$ increases. As the anion becomes relatively more mobile, its contribution to charge transport grows, and the fraction of current carried by the cation, $t_+$, necessarily decreases.\n\n### Part 2: Trade-off Metric $\\Xi(x)$\n\nThe trade-off metric $\\Xi(x)$ is defined as:\n$$ \\Xi(x) = \\dfrac{\\kappa(x)/\\kappa(0) - 1}{1 - t_+(x)/t_+(0)} $$\nThis metric quantifies the efficiency of the cosolvent addition. The numerator, $\\kappa(x)/\\kappa(0) - 1$, represents the fractional gain in ionic conductivity relative to the base solvent. The denominator, $1 - t_+(x)/t_+(0)$, represents the fractional loss in cation transference number. A higher value of $\\Xi(x)$ indicates a more favorable trade-off, where a large conductivity enhancement is achieved for a small penalty in transference number. By convention, $\\Xi(0) = 0$, as there is no gain or loss at $x=0$.\n\n### Part 3: Computational Implementation\n\nThe problem is solved computationally by first defining Python functions corresponding to the derived equations for $\\eta_{\\text{mix}}(x)$, $\\varepsilon_r(x)$, $K_{\\text{ip}}(x)$, $\\alpha(x)$, $D_i(x)$, $\\kappa(x)$, and $t_+(x)$. All physical constants and parameters are defined in SI units. The baseline values $\\kappa(0)$ and $t_+(0)$ are calculated first. Then, for each specified mole fraction $x$ in the test suite, the program calculates the tuple $[\\kappa(x), t_+(x), \\Xi(x), \\text{improved}(x)]$. The boolean $\\text{improved}(x)$ is determined by the conditions $\\kappa(x) > \\kappa(0)$ and $t_+(x) < t_+(0)$. The results are then formatted into the required string output. The full implementation is provided in the final answer.",
