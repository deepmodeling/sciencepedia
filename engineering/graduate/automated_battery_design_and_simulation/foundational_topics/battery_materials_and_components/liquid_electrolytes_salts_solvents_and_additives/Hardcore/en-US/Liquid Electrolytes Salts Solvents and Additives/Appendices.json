            "solution": "The problem statement is critically validated and deemed to be self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. All data required for a unique solution are provided, and the problem is based on fundamental principles of classical electrostatics, specifically the Born model of ionic solvation. The physical constants and material properties are realistic. No flaws, ambiguities, or contradictions are present. We may therefore proceed with a formal derivation and solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the change in the molar Born solvation free energy, $\\Delta \\Delta G$, for a monovalent cation $\\mathrm{Li}^{+}$ when moved from a solvent of ethylene carbonate (EC) to 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME). We begin by deriving the expression for the Born solvation free energy from first principles.\n\nThe Born model treats the ion as a rigid, spherical conductor of radius $r_{\\mathrm{B}}$ and charge $q$, and the solvent as a structureless continuum with relative permittivity $\\varepsilon_r$. The electrostatic self-energy of the ion is the work required to charge the sphere from an uncharged state to its final charge $q$.\n\nFirst, consider charging the sphere in a vacuum, where the permittivity is $\\varepsilon_0$. The electrostatic potential $\\phi(q')$ on the surface of a sphere of radius $r_{\\mathrm{B}}$ carrying a charge $q'$ is given by Gauss's law:\n$$ \\phi(q') = \\frac{q'}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r_{\\mathrm{B}}} $$\nThe incremental work, $dW$, required to bring an infinitesimal charge $dq'$ from infinity to the surface of this sphere is:\n$$ dW = \\phi(q') dq' = \\frac{q'}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r_{\\mathrm{B}}} dq' $$\nThe total work to charge the sphere from $q' = 0$ to $q' = q$, which represents the electrostatic self-energy in vacuum, $W_{\\mathrm{vac}}$, is the integral of this expression:\n$$ W_{\\mathrm{vac}} = \\int_0^q \\frac{q'}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r_{\\mathrm{B}}} dq' = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r_{\\mathrm{B}}} \\int_0^q q' dq' = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r_{\\mathrm{B}}} \\left[ \\frac{q'^2}{2} \\right]_0^q = \\frac{q^2}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r_{\\mathrm{B}}} $$\nNext, we perform the same charging process, but with the sphere immersed in a dielectric medium of relative permittivity $\\varepsilon_r$. The absolute permittivity of the medium is $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0$. The derivation is identical, with $\\varepsilon_0$ replaced by $\\varepsilon$:\n$$ W_{\\mathrm{med}} = \\frac{q^2}{8\\pi\\varepsilon r_{\\mathrm{B}}} = \\frac{q^2}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0 r_{\\mathrm{B}}} $$\nThe Born solvation free energy, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{Born}}$, is defined as the work of transferring the ion from vacuum to the solvent. This corresponds to the difference between the electrostatic self-energy in the medium and in vacuum:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{Born}} = W_{\\mathrm{med}} - W_{\\mathrm{vac}} = \\frac{q^2}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0 r_{\\mathrm{B}}} - \\frac{q^2}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r_{\\mathrm{B}}} $$\nFactoring out the common terms yields the Born equation for a single ion:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{Born}} = \\frac{q^2}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r_{\\mathrm{B}}} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_r} - 1 \\right) $$\nSince $\\varepsilon_r > 1$ for any material medium, the solvation free energy is always negative, indicating a spontaneous process.\n\nThe problem asks for the *molar* change in energy. The molar Born solvation free energy, which we denote with a capital $\\Delta G$, is obtained by multiplying the single-ion energy by the Avogadro constant, $N_{\\mathrm{A}}$:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{Born,molar}}(\\varepsilon_r) = N_{\\mathrm{A}} \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{Born}} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{A}} q^2}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r_{\\mathrm{B}}} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_r} - 1 \\right) $$\nWe are interested in the difference in this quantity when changing the solvent from EC to DME, denoted as $\\Delta \\Delta G$:\n$$ \\Delta \\Delta G = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{Born,molar}}(\\mathrm{DME}) - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{Born,molar}}(\\mathrm{EC}) $$\nSubstituting the expression for the molar energy:\n$$ \\Delta \\Delta G = \\left[ \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{A}} q^2}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r_{\\mathrm{B}}} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{r,\\mathrm{DME}}} - 1 \\right) \\right] - \\left[ \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{A}} q^2}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r_{\\mathrm{B}}} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{r,\\mathrm{EC}}} - 1 \\right) \\right] $$\nThe constant prefactor and the '$-1$' term cancel upon subtraction, simplifying the expression to:\n$$ \\Delta \\Delta G = \\frac{N_{\\mathrmA} q^2}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r_{\\mathrmB}} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{r,\\mathrm{DME}}} - \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{r,\\mathrm{EC}}} \\right) $$\nThis is the final analytical expression we need to evaluate. The ion is $\\mathrm{Li}^{+}$, so its charge is $q = +e$.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values, ensuring all are in SI units:\n- $N_{\\mathrm{A}} = 6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}$\n- $e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n- $\\varepsilon_0 = 8.8541878128 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F\\,m^{-1}}$ (or $\\mathrm{C^2\\,J^{-1}\\,m^{-1}}$)\n- $r_{\\mathrm{B}} = 0.090\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 0.090 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $\\varepsilon_{r,\\mathrm{DME}} = 7$\n- $\\varepsilon_{r,\\mathrm{EC}} = 90$\n\nLet's calculate the prefactor $\\frac{N_{\\mathrmA} e^2}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r_{\\mathrmB}}$:\n$$ \\frac{N_{\\mathrmA} e^2}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r_{\\mathrmB}} = \\frac{(6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol^{-1}})(1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C})^2}{8\\pi (8.8541878128 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{C^2\\,J^{-1}\\,m^{-1}}) (0.090 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m})} $$\n$$ \\frac{N_{\\mathrmA} e^2}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r_{\\mathrmB}} \\approx \\frac{1.5459306 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,m\\,mol^{-1}}}{2.0020606 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,m}} \\approx 7.721708 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} $$\nNow, we calculate the term involving the relative permittivities:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{r,\\mathrm{DME}}} - \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{r,\\mathrm{EC}}} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{1}{7} - \\frac{1}{90} \\right) \\approx 0.14285714 - 0.01111111 = 0.13174603 $$\nCombining these results:\n$$ \\Delta \\Delta G \\approx (7.721708 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}) \\times (0.13174603) $$\n$$ \\Delta \\Delta G \\approx 101740.16\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in $\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$.

It is objective.\n-   **No other flaws detected**: The problem is complete, consistent, realistic, and formally structured.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation begins from the fundamental principles as requested. The constitutive relation for ionic conduction in an isotropic medium is the local form of Ohm's law, which states that the current density vector $\\vec{J}$ is proportional to the electric field vector $\\vec{E}$:\n$$\n\\vec{J} = \\kappa \\vec{E}\n$$\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the ionic conductivity of the medium.\n\nFor a parallel-plate cell with a uniform electric field directed along the axis connecting the electrodes (let's call this the $x$-axis), the vector relation simplifies to a scalar one: $J = \\kappa E$. The problem assumes negligible fringing fields, justifying this one-dimensional approximation.\n\nThe electric field $E$ is related to the potential difference $\\Delta V$ across the electrolyte of thickness $L$ by $E = \\frac{\\Delta V}{L}$, assuming a uniform field. The total current $I$ flowing through the electrolyte is the product of the current density $J$ and the electrode area $A$: $I = J A$.\n\nThe resistance of the electrolyte, $R_{el}$, is defined by Ohm's law as the ratio of the potential difference across it to the current flowing through it:\n$$\nR_{el} = \\frac{\\Delta V}{I}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\Delta V$ and $I$ in terms of $E$ and $J$:\n$$\nR_{el} = \\frac{E L}{J A}\n$$\nUsing the constitutive relation $J = \\kappa E$, we can write $\\frac{E}{J} = \\frac{1}{\\kappa}$. Substituting this into the expression for $R_{el}$ yields the well-known formula for the resistance of a uniform conductor:\n$$\nR_{el} = \\frac{L}{\\kappa A}\n$$\nThe problem states that in an EIS measurement, the high-frequency real-axis intercept, $Z'_{hf}$, represents the sum of all ohmic resistances in series. In this symmetric cell, these resistances are the bulk electrolyte resistance $R_{el}$ and the frequency-independent contact and wiring resistance $R_c$. The impedance of the interfacial parallel RC/CPE elements approaches zero at infinite frequency, justifying their exclusion from $Z'_{hf}$.\nThus, the total measured high-frequency resistance is:\n$$\nZ'_{hf} = R_{el} + R_c = \\frac{L}{\\kappa A} + R_c\n$$\nTwo measurements are performed with different spacer thicknesses, $L_1$ and $L_2$. The corresponding measured high-frequency resistances are $Z'_{hf,1}$ and $Z'_{hf,2}$. The conductivity $\\kappa$, area $A$, and contact resistance $R_c$ are constant for both experiments. This gives a system of two linear equations:\n1.  For thickness $L_1$: $Z'_{hf,1} = \\frac{L_1}{\\kappa A} + R_c$\n2.  For thickness $L_2$: $Z'_{hf,2} = \\frac{L_2}{\\kappa A} + R_c$\n\nTo eliminate the unknown contact resistance $R_c$, we subtract the first equation from the second:\n$$\nZ'_{hf,2} - Z'_{hf,1} = \\left(\\frac{L_2}{\\kappa A} + R_c\\right) - \\left(\\frac{L_1}{\\kappa A} + R_c\\right)\n$$\n$$\nZ'_{hf,2} - Z'_{hf,1} = \\frac{L_2}{\\kappa A} - \\frac{L_1}{\\kappa A} = \\frac{L_2 - L_1}{\\kappa A}\n$$\nThis equation can now be rearranged to solve for the ionic conductivity $\\kappa$:\n$$\n\\kappa = \\frac{L_2 - L_1}{A (Z'_{hf,2} - Z'_{hf,1})}\n$$\nThis is the required analytical expression for $\\kappa$ that is independent of $R_c$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the provided data:\n-   $A = 1.000 \\times 10^{-4}$ m$^2$\n-   $L_1 = 1.00 \\times 10^{-4}$ m\n-   $L_2 = 2.50 \\times 10^{-4}$ m\n-   $Z'_{hf,1} = 1.1333$ $\\Omega$\n-   $Z'_{hf,2} = 2.3833$ $\\Omega$\n\nFirst, calculate the differences:\n$$\n\\Delta L = L_2 - L_1 = (2.50 \\times 10^{-4} - 1.00 \\times 10^{-4}) \\, \\text{m} = 1.50 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{m}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta Z' = Z'_{hf,2} - Z'_{hf,1} = (2.3833 - 1.1333) \\, \\Omega = 1.2500 \\, \\Omega\n$$\nSubstitute these values into the expression for $\\kappa$:\n$$\n\\kappa = \\frac{1.50 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{m}}{(1.000 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{m}^2)(1.2500 \\, \\Omega)}\n$$\n$$\n\\kappa = \\frac{1.50}{1.000 \\times 1.2500} \\, \\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{m}^2 \\cdot \\Omega} = \\frac{1.50}{1.2500} \\, \\Omega^{-1} \\text{m}^{-1}\n$$\nThe unit $\\Omega^{-1}$ is the siemens ($S$).\n$$\n\\kappa = 1.2 \\, \\text{S m}^{-1}\n$$\nThe calculated value is exactly $1.2$.

Using the provided variable definitions, $x = [S\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{HF}]$:\n$$ K_{S} = \\frac{[S\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{HF}]}{[S][\\mathrm{HF}]} = \\frac{x}{[S]h_f} $$\n\nMass balance equations are required to relate the concentrations of species.\n$1$. **Fluorine Mass Balance**: The total initial analytical concentration of HF, $C_0$, must equal the sum of the equilibrium concentrations of all fluorine-containing species derived from it: undissociated HF, fluoride ion $\\mathrm{F}^{-}$, and the scavenger complex $S\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{HF}$.\n$$ C_0 = [\\mathrm{HF}] + [\\mathrm{F}^{-}] + [S\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{HF}] = h_f + y + x $$\n$2$. **Scavenger Mass Balance**: The total added scavenger concentration, $C_S$, is the sum of the free scavenger $[S]$ and the complexed scavenger $[S\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{HF}]$.\n$$ C_S = [S] + [S\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{HF}] = [S] + x $$\n\nThe objective is to find the minimum dose $C_S$ required to meet the design target $h_f = T = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$.\n\nFirst, we determine the residual acidity, $y = [\\mathrm{H}^{+}]$, when the free HF concentration is at its target value, $h_f = T$. From the $K_a$ expression:\n$$ y^2 = K_a h_f = K_a T $$\n$$ y = \\sqrt{K_a T} $$\nThis value is independent of the scavenger used, as it depends only on the properties of HF in the solvent and the target free HF concentration. Substituting the given values:\n$$ y = \\sqrt{(1.0 \\times 10^{-6}) \\cdot (1.0 \\times 10^{-5})} = \\sqrt{1.0 \\times 10^{-11}} = \\sqrt{10 \\times 10^{-12}} = \\sqrt{10} \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}} $$\nNumerically, $y \\approx 3.162277... \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$.\n\nNext, we determine the concentration of the neutralized complex, $x$, from the fluorine mass balance equation by setting $h_f = T$:\n$$ x = C_0 - h_f - y = C_0 - T - \\sqrt{K_a T} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ x = (2.0 \\times 10^{-3}) - (1.0 \\times 10^{-5}) - (3.162277... \\times 10^{-6}) = 1.9868377... \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}} $$\n\nNow, we derive the general expression for the required scavenger dose, $C_S$. From the scavenger mass balance, $C_S = [S] + x$. The concentration of free scavenger, $[S]$, can be found by rearranging the $K_S$ expression:\n$$ [S] = \\frac{x}{K_S h_f} = \\frac{x}{K_S T} $$\nSubstituting this into the scavenger mass balance equation:\n$$ C_S = \\frac{x}{K_S T} + x = x \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{K_S T} \\right) $$\nFinally, we substitute the expression for $x$:\n$$ C_S = (C_0 - T - \\sqrt{K_a T}) \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{K_S T} \\right) $$\nThis is the general formula for the required scavenger dose. We now compute the specific values for TMSP and LiPO$_2$F$_2$.\n\n**Case 1: TMSP**\nGiven $K_{S,\\mathrm{TMSP}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{8}~\\mathrm{L\\,mol^{-1}}$.\nThe dimensionless product $K_{S,\\mathrm{TMSP}} T$ is:\n$$ K_{S,\\mathrm{TMSP}} T = (1.0 \\times 10^{8}) \\cdot (1.0 \\times 10^{-5}) = 1000 $$\nThe required dose $C_{S,\\mathrm{TMSP}}$ is:\n$$ C_{S,\\mathrm{TMSP}} = x \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{1000} \\right) = (1.9868377... \\times 10^{-3}) \\cdot (1.001) $$\n$$ C_{S,\\mathrm{TMSP}} = 1.9888245... \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}} $$\nConverting to $\\mathrm{mmol\\,L^{-1}}$ and rounding to four significant figures:\n$$ C_{S,\\mathrm{TMSP}} \\approx 1.989~\\mathrm{mmol\\,L^{-1}} $$\n\n**Case 2: LiPO$_2$F$_2$**\nGiven $K_{S,\\mathrm{LiPO_{2}F_{2}}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{5}~\\mathrm{L\\,mol^{-1}}$.\nThe dimensionless product $K_{S,\\mathrm{LiPO_{2}F_{2}}} T$ is:\n$$ K_{S,\\mathrm{LiPO_{2}F_{2}}} T = (1.0 \\times 10^{5}) \\cdot (1.0 \\times 10^{-5}) = 1.0 $$\nThe required dose $C_{S,\\mathrm{LiPO_{2}F_{2}}}$ is:\n$$ C_{S,\\mathrm{LiPO_{2}F_{2}}} = x \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{1.0} \\right) = (1.9868377... \\times 10^{-3}) \\cdot (2) $$\n$$ C_{S,\\mathrm{LiPO_{2}F_{2}}} = 3.9736754... \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}} $$\nConverting to $\\mathrm{mmol\\,L^{-1}}$ and rounding to four significant figures:\n$$ C_{S,\\mathrm{LiPO_{2}F_{2}}} \\approx 3.974~\\mathrm{mmol\\,L^{-1}} $$\n\nFinally, the residual acidity $y$ for both cases is the same value calculated earlier, rounded to four significant figures:\n$$ y = 3.162277... \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}} \\approx 3.162 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}} $$\n\nThe results are compiled in the requested order: $\\big[C_{S,\\mathrm{TMSP}}~(\\mathrm{mmol~L^{-1}}),~y_{\\mathrm{TMSP}}~(\\mathrm{mol~L^{-1}}),~C_{S,\\mathrm{LiPO_{2}F_{2}}}~(\\mathrm{mmol~L^{-1}}),~y_{\\mathrm{LiPO_{2}F_{2}}}~(\\mathrm{mol~L^{-1}})\\big]$.",
