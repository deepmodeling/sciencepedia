A solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\n\nThe objective is to find the relationship between the areal mass loading of active material, $m_{\\text{areal}}$, and the electrode parameters.\n\nThe total volume of an electrode with thickness $L$ and unit area $A = 1$ is $V_{\\text{total}} = L \\times A = L$. For a general area $A$, $V_{\\text{total}} = L \\cdot A$.\n\nThe porosity, $\\varepsilon$, is the fraction of the total volume that is void (filled with electrolyte). Therefore, the volume fraction of the solid material (the electrode skeleton) is $(1 - \\varepsilon)$. The total volume occupied by solid material is $V_{\\text{solid}} = (1 - \\varepsilon) V_{\\text{total}}$.\n\nThe active material constitutes a fraction $\\phi_a$ of this solid skeleton. Thus, the volume of the active material, $V_{\\text{active}}$, is:\n$$V_{\\text{active}} = \\phi_a V_{\\text{solid}} = \\phi_a (1 - \\varepsilon) V_{\\text{total}}$$\n\nThe problem defines the active solid volume fraction, $\\varepsilon_{s,\\text{active}}$, as the fraction of the total electrode volume occupied by the active material. This can be expressed as:\n$$\\varepsilon_{s,\\text{active}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{active}}}{V_{\\text{total}}}$$\nSubstituting the previous expression for $V_{\\text{active}}$ confirms the definition provided in the problem statement:\n$$\\varepsilon_{s,\\text{active}} = \\frac{\\phi_a (1 - \\varepsilon) V_{\\text{total}}}{V_{\\text{total}}} = \\phi_a (1 - \\varepsilon)$$\n\nThe mass of the active material, $M_{\\text{active}}$, is the product of its volume, $V_{\\text{active}}$, and its true (intrinsic) density, $\\rho_s$.\n$$M_{\\text{active}} = V_{\\text{active}} \\cdot \\rho_s$$\nSubstituting the expression for $V_{\\text{active}}$ in terms of $\\varepsilon_{s,\\text{active}}$ and $V_{\\text{total}}$:\n$$M_{\\text{active}} = (\\varepsilon_{s,\\text{active}} \\cdot V_{\\text{total}}) \\cdot \\rho_s$$\nSince $V_{\\text{total}} = L \\cdot A$ for an electrode of area $A$:\n$$M_{\\text{active}} = \\varepsilon_{s,\\text{active}} \\cdot L \\cdot A \\cdot \\rho_s$$\n\nThe areal mass loading, $m_{\\text{areal}}$, is defined as the total mass of active material per unit area.\n$$m_{\\text{areal}} = \\frac{M_{\\text{active}}}{A}$$\nThis derivation is consistent with the integral definition provided. Because all properties are uniform through the thickness, the local mass density of active material (mass of active material per total electrode volume) is a constant, $\\rho_{v,\\text{active}} = \\varepsilon_{s,\\text{active}} \\cdot \\rho_s$. The integral of this density over the thickness $L$ gives the mass per unit area:\n$$m_{\\text{areal}} = \\int_0^L \\rho_{v,\\text{active}} \\, dz = \\int_0^L (\\varepsilon_{s,\\text{active}} \\cdot \\rho_s) \\, dz = (\\varepsilon_{s,\\text{active}} \\cdot \\rho_s) \\int_0^L dz = \\varepsilon_{s,\\text{active}} \\cdot \\rho_s \\cdot L$$\nThis is the desired relationship between $m_{\\text{areal}}$, $L$, $\\rho_s$, and $\\varepsilon_{s,\\text{active}}$.\n\nTo compute the required $\\varepsilon_{s,\\text{active}}$, we rearrange this equation:\n$$\\varepsilon_{s,\\text{active}} = \\frac{m_{\\text{areal}}}{\\rho_s \\cdot L}$$\n\nNext, we substitute the given numerical values, ensuring consistent units. We will convert all units to grams ($\\text{g}$) and centimeters ($\\text{cm}$).\nGiven values:\n- $m_{\\text{areal}} = 12\\,\\text{mg/cm}^2 = 12 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{g/cm}^2 = 0.012\\,\\text{g/cm}^2$\n- $L = 70\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 70 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{cm} = 0.0070\\,\\text{cm}$\n- $\\rho_s = 2.3\\,\\text{g/cm}^3$\n\nNow, we compute $\\varepsilon_{s,\\text{active}}$:\n$$\\varepsilon_{s,\\text{active}} = \\frac{0.012\\,\\text{g/cm}^2}{(2.3\\,\\text{g/cm}^3) \\cdot (0.0070\\,\\text{cm})}$$\nThe denominator is:\n$$ (2.3\\,\\text{g/cm}^3) \\cdot (0.0070\\,\\text{cm}) = 0.0161\\,\\text{g/cm}^2 $$\nThe calculation for $\\varepsilon_{s,\\text{active}}$ is:\n$$\\varepsilon_{s,\\text{active}} = \\frac{0.012}{0.0161} \\approx 0.7453416149$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\varepsilon_{s,\\text{active}} \\approx 0.7453$$\nThis value is dimensionless, as expected for a volume fraction.\n\nAs an optional task, we can express the porosity $\\varepsilon$ as a function of the active fraction $\\phi_a$. Starting from the definition:\n$$\\varepsilon_{s,\\text{active}} = \\phi_a (1 - \\varepsilon)$$\nWe rearrange to solve for $\\varepsilon$:\n$$1 - \\varepsilon = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{s,\\text{active}}}{\\phi_a}$$\n$$\\varepsilon(\\phi_a) = 1 - \\frac{\\varepsilon_{s,\\text{active}}}{\\phi_a}$$\nHere, $\\varepsilon_{s,\\text{active}}$ is the constant value we have just determined. This expression shows the trade-off between porosity and the active fraction of the solid phase required to achieve a fixed active solid volume fraction. For this relation to be physically meaningful, we must have $\\phi_a \\ge \\varepsilon_{s,\\text{active}}$ to ensure $\\varepsilon \\ge 0$.",
