This exercise  explores the foundational concept of electrode balancing, demonstrating how the interplay between individual electrode stoichiometry limits, such as $x_p$ and $x_n$, and the total lithium inventory determines a cell's final Open-Circuit Voltage (OCV) versus State of Charge (SOC) characteristic. Mastering this principle is a critical first step in battery design, as it dictates the cell's ultimate operational limits and performance.",

            "problem": "A lithium-ion full cell couples a positive intercalation host with lithium site stoichiometry $x_p \\in [x_p^{\\min}, x_p^{\\max}]$ and a negative intercalation host with lithium site stoichiometry $x_n \\in [x_n^{\\min}, x_n^{\\max}]$. Let $N_p$ and $N_n$ denote the total moles of lattice sites in the positive and negative active materials, respectively, so that $N_p x_p$ and $N_n x_n$ are the moles of lithium resident in each host. Let $L_0$ be the total cyclable lithium inventory in the active materials, so that lithium conservation imposes $N_p x_p + N_n x_n = L_0$ at equilibrium. Define the electrode balancing ratio $b \\equiv N_n/N_p$. The Open-Circuit Voltage (OCV) of the full cell is $U_{\\mathrm{cell}}(x_p,x_n) = U_p(x_p) - U_n(x_n)$, where $U_p(\\cdot)$ and $U_n(\\cdot)$ are the half-cell equilibrium potentials against a lithium reference for the positive and negative hosts, respectively. Assume $U_p(\\cdot)$ and $U_n(\\cdot)$ are well-defined single-valued functions on the above stoichiometry intervals. Under galvanostatic charge, lithium moves from the positive to the negative host, so $dx_p < 0$ and $dx_n > 0$; under discharge, $dx_p > 0$ and $dx_n < 0$.\n\nThe cell State of Charge (SOC) is defined to increase monotonically with $x_n$ (equivalently decrease with $x_p$) along the feasible set determined by lithium conservation and the partial lithiation bounds.

            "solution": "The problem statement is a valid exercise in determining the operational range of a lithium-ion cell based on a standard zero-dimensional equilibrium model. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary parameters and constraints are provided to derive a unique solution.\n\nThe state of the cell is described by the stoichiometry of the positive electrode, $x_p$, and the negative electrode, $x_n$. The feasible states are determined by three simultaneous constraints:\n1.  The stoichiometry of the positive electrode is bounded: $x_p \\in [x_p^{\\min}, x_p^{\\max}]$.\n2.  The stoichiometry of the negative electrode is bounded: $x_n \\in [x_n^{\\min}, x_n^{\\max}]$.\n3.  The total amount of cyclable lithium is conserved: $N_p x_p + N_n x_n = L_0$.\n\nThe third constraint, the lithium conservation law, can be rearranged to express one stoichiometry in terms of the other. For instance, expressing $x_p$ as a function of $x_n$:\n$$x_p = \\frac{L_0 - N_n x_n}{N_p}$$\nSimilarly,\n$$x_n = \\frac{L_0 - N_p x_p}{N_n}$$\nThis linear relationship means that the set of all possible equilibrium states $(x_p, x_n)$ forms a line segment. The endpoints of this segment are determined by the intersection of the line with the rectangular boundary defined by the stoichiometry limits $[x_p^{\\min}, x_p^{\\max}] \\times [x_n^{\\min}, x_n^{\\max}]$.\n\nThe problem defines the State of Charge (SOC) to be monotonically increasing with $x_n$. Consequently, the charge-end of the cell's operating window corresponds to the maximum achievable value of $x_n$, while the discharge-end corresponds to the minimum achievable value of $x_n$.\n\nLet's derive the stoichiometries at the charge-end, denoted by $(x_p^{\\mathrm{ch}}, x_n^{\\mathrm{ch}})$. This state corresponds to the highest SOC, which means $x_n$ is maximized and $x_p$ is minimized. Let's find the minimum possible value for $x_p$.\nThe value of $x_p$ must satisfy its intrinsic lower bound:\n$$x_p \\ge x_p^{\\min}$$\nAdditionally, the corresponding value of $x_n = (L_0 - N_p x_p)/N_n$ must not exceed its upper bound, $x_n^{\\max}$:\n$$\\frac{L_0 - N_p x_p}{N_n} \\le x_n^{\\max}$$\n$$L_0 - N_p x_p \\le N_n x_n^{\\max}$$\n$$L_0 - N_n x_n^{\\max} \\le N_p x_p$$\n$$x_p \\ge \\frac{L_0 - N_n x_n^{\\max}}{N_p}$$\nFor a state to be valid, $x_p$ must satisfy both lower bounds.

This state corresponds to the lowest SOC, which means $x_n$ is minimized and $x_p$ is maximized. Let's find the maximum possible value for $x_p$.\nThe value of $x_p$ must satisfy its intrinsic upper bound:\n$$x_p \\le x_p^{\\max}$$\nAdditionally, the corresponding value of $x_n = (L_0 - N_p x_p)/N_n$ must not go below its lower bound, $x_n^{\\min}$:\n$$\\frac{L_0 - N_p x_p}{N_n} \\ge x_n^{\\min}$$\n$$L_0 - N_p x_p \\ge N_n x_n^{\\min}$$\n$$N_p x_p \\le L_0 - N_n x_n^{\\min}$$\n$$x_p \\le \\frac{L_0 - N_n x_n^{\\min}}{N_p}$$\nFor a state to be valid, $x_p$ must satisfy both upper bounds. Therefore, the maximum possible value of $x_p$ is the minimum of these two bounds:\n$$x_p^{\\mathrm{dis}} = \\min\\left(x_p^{\\max},\\,\\frac{L_0 - N_n x_n^{\\min}}{N_p}\\right)$$\nThe corresponding negative electrode stoichiometry is found from the conservation law:\n$$x_n^{\\mathrm{dis}} = \\frac{L_0 - N_p x_p^{\\mathrm{dis}}}{N_n}$$\n\nThe maximum OCV window is defined as the OCV at the discharge-end minus the OCV at the charge-end. The OCV of the cell is $U_{\\mathrm{cell}} = U_p(x_p) - U_n(x_n)$.\nSo, the OCV window is:\n$$ \\Delta U_{\\max} = U_{\\mathrm{cell}}(x_p^{\\mathrm{dis}}, x_n^{\\mathrm{dis}}) - U_{\\mathrm{cell}}(x_p^{\\mathrm{ch}}, x_n^{\\mathrm{ch}}) $$\n$$ \\Delta U_{\\max} = \\Big[U_p(x_p^{\\mathrm{dis}}) - U_n(x_n^{\\mathrm{dis}})\\Big] - \\Big[U_p(x_p^{\\mathrm{ch}}) - U_n(x_n^{\\mathrm{ch}})\\Big] $$\n\nNow we evaluate each option.\n\nA.

This is incorrect. As derived, the maximum value for $x_p$ must be the minimum of the two upper bounds, not the maximum. The use of $\\min$ and $\\max$ is reversed.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC.

This is a special case that occurs only when the lithium inventory $L_0$ is perfectly matched to the electrode capacities (i.e., $L_0 = N_p x_p^{\\min} + N_n x_n^{\\max}$ and $L_0 = N_p x_p^{\\max} + N_n x_n^{\\min}$, which is generally not possible unless the cyclable capacity is identical for both electrodes). In general, the operating window is limited by only one electrode's stoichiometry limit at each end. This option oversimplifies the general case. It also incorrectly claims the result is independent of $L_0$ and the balancing ratio $b = N_n/N_p$, whereas our derivation clearly shows the endpoints depend on these parameters.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. This option states the endpoints in terms of $x_n$:\n$x_n^{\\mathrm{ch}}=\\max\\!\\left(x_n^{\\max},\\,\\frac{L_0-N_p x_p^{\\min}}{N_n}\\right)$. The charge-end is the maximum achievable $x_n$.

Therefore, the maximum value of $x_n$ is the minimum of these two upper bounds: $x_n^{\\mathrm{ch}} = \\min(x_n^{\\max}, (L_0 - N_p x_p^{\\min})/N_n)$. The option incorrectly uses $\\max$.\n$x_n^{\\mathrm{dis}}=\\min\\!\\left(x_n^{\\min},\\,\\frac{L_0-N_p x_p^{\\max}}{N_n}\\right)$.

            "problem": "A two-phase intercalation electrode operating near a plateau exhibits open-circuit voltage (OCV) hysteresis between lithiation and delithiation due to elastic coherency stresses and phase-boundary curvature. Consider an ensemble of identical spherical active particles of radius $R$ undergoing a coherent $\\alpha \\leftrightarrow \\beta$ transformation over a plateau. Let the stress-free, curvature-free plateau be characterized by a baseline open-circuit voltage $U_0$ with respect to the reference electrode. Assume isothermal conditions and negligible electronic and ionic transport overpotentials so that the measured OCV is governed by equilibrium thermodynamics. The partial molar volume of intercalated lithium in the solid is $\\Omega$, the hydrostatic coherency stress magnitude in the transforming phase during the plateau is $\\sigma$ (compressive during lithiation and tensile during delithiation, with equal magnitude), and the interphase energy per unit area is $\\gamma$. The moving phase boundary is locally spherical with a curvature set by the particle geometry; use the mean curvature of a sphere. The Faraday constant is $F$. The ensemble passes a total plateau charge $Q_{\\mathrm{pl}}$ during both lithiation and delithiation over the same state-of-charge (SOC) interval.\n\nStarting from the definition that the equilibrium cell open-circuit voltage equals the difference in electrochemical potentials per unit charge and from the fundamental thermodynamic coupling of hydrostatic stress and curvature-induced Laplace pressure to chemical potential in solids, perform the following:\n\n1.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. It is grounded in the established thermodynamic principles governing chemo-mechanical coupling in phase-transforming battery electrodes. The provided parameters are physically realistic for such systems. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be furnished.\n\nThe solution is structured in two parts as requested: first, the derivation of the lithiation and delithiation plateau voltages and the resulting hysteresis width, and second, the calculation of the dissipated energy over a full cycle.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of Plateau Voltages and Hysteresis\n\nThe open-circuit voltage (OCV), $U$, of an electrode is fundamentally related to the chemical potential, $\\mu$, of the intercalating species (in this case, lithium) within the active material. The relationship is given by:\n$$F U = \\mu_{\\mathrm{ref}} - \\mu$$\nwhere $F$ is the Faraday constant and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ is the chemical potential of the reference electrode. Any change in the chemical potential of the electrode material, $d\\mu$, will cause a change in the OCV, $dU$, according to:\n$$F \\, dU = -d\\mu$$\nLet $U_0$ be the baseline plateau voltage corresponding to a stress-free and curvature-free phase transformation, where the chemical potentials of the lithium-poor phase ($\\alpha$) and lithium-rich phase ($\\beta$) are equal, $\\mu_{\\alpha} = \\mu_{\\beta} = \\mu_0$. The deviation of the voltage from this baseline, $\\Delta U = U-U_0$, is caused by a shift in chemical potential, $\\Delta\\mu = \\mu - \\mu_0$, such that $\\Delta U = - \\Delta\\mu / F$.\n\nThis shift in chemical potential, $\\Delta\\mu$, arises from two physical effects described in the problem: hydrostatic coherency stress and phase-boundary curvature. The contribution of a hydrostatic pressure, $P$, to the chemical potential is given by $\\Delta\\mu = \\Omega P$, where $\\Omega$ is the partial molar volume.\n\n1.  **Lithiation Process ($U_{\\mathrm{L}}$)**\n    During lithiation, the $\\beta$ phase grows at the expense of the $\\alpha$ phase. The voltage is determined by the chemical potential of lithium in the newly forming $\\beta$ phase.\n    -   **Stress Effect**: The $\\beta$ phase is under a compressive hydrostatic stress of magnitude $\\sigma$. This corresponds to a positive pressure, $P_{\\mathrm{stress}} = +\\sigma$. The chemical potential is raised by this stress: $\\Delta\\mu_{\\mathrm{stress}} = +\\Omega\\sigma$.\n    -   **Curvature Effect**: The formation of a new phase with a curved interface incurs an energy penalty, described by the Laplace pressure, $P_{\\mathrm{L}}$. For a spherical interface of effective radius $R$, the Laplace pressure is $P_{\\mathrm{L}} = 2\\gamma/R$, where $\\gamma$ is the interfacial energy. This pressure acts on the new phase, raising its chemical potential: $\\Delta\\mu_{\\mathrm{curvature}} = +\\Omega(2\\gamma/R)$.\n    -   **Total Potential Shift**: The total shift in chemical potential during lithiation is the sum of these two effects:\n        $$\\Delta\\mu_{\\mathrm{L}} = \\Delta\\mu_{\\mathrm{stress}} + \\Delta\\mu_{\\mathrm{curvature}} = \\Omega\\sigma + \\frac{2\\Omega\\gamma}{R} = \\Omega\\left(\\sigma + \\frac{2\\gamma}{R}\\right)$$\n    -   **Lithiation Voltage**: A higher chemical potential for lithium in the electrode makes intercalation energetically less favorable, thus lowering the equilibrium voltage.\n        $$U_{\\mathrm{L}} = U_0 + \\Delta U_{\\mathrm{L}} = U_0 - \\frac{\\Delta\\mu_{\\mathrm{L}}}{F} = U_0 - \\frac{\\Omega}{F}\\left(\\sigma + \\frac{2\\gamma}{R}\\right)$$\n\n2.  **Delithiation Process ($U_{\\mathrm{D}}$)**\n    During delithiation, the $\\alpha$ phase grows at the expense of the $\\beta$ phase. The voltage is determined by the chemical potential of lithium being extracted from the $\\beta$ phase.\n    -   **Stress Effect**: The host $\\beta$ phase is now under a tensile stress of magnitude $\\sigma$. This corresponds to a negative pressure, $P_{\\mathrm{stress}} = -\\sigma$. The chemical potential is lowered by this stress: $\\Delta\\mu_{\\mathrm{stress}} = -\\Omega\\sigma$.\n    -   **Curvature Effect**: The interfacial energy resists the shrinking of the $\\beta$ phase (which is equivalent to creating more $\\alpha$-$\\beta$ interface area). This makes it more difficult to extract lithium. The energy barrier to be overcome is the same magnitude as in the lithiation case, but it now acts to increase the delithiation voltage. The required work to extract one mole of Li against this barrier is $\\Omega(2\\gamma/R)$. This corresponds to an effective increase in the Li chemical potential driving the delithiation reaction, or more directly, an increase in the cell voltage.\n    -   **Sign Reversal Logic**: For both stress and curvature, the effect opposes the direction of transformation. Lithiation is opposed by compression and interface creation, lowering the voltage. Delithiation is opposed by tension and interface persistence, raising the voltage. Therefore, the signs of both contributions to the voltage deviation must reverse.\n    -   **Delithiation Voltage**: The voltage is raised relative to the baseline $U_0$.\n        $$U_{\\mathrm{D}} = U_0 + \\frac{\\Omega}{F}\\left(\\sigma + \\frac{2\\gamma}{R}\\right)$$\n\n3.  **Hysteresis Width ($\\Delta U$)**\n    The hysteresis width is defined as the difference between the delithiation and lithiation plateau voltages.\n    $$\\Delta U \\equiv U_{\\mathrm{D}} - U_{\\mathrm{L}}$$\n    $$\\Delta U = \\left(U_0 + \\frac{\\Omega}{F}\\left(\\sigma + \\frac{2\\gamma}{R}\\right)\\right) - \\left(U_0 - \\frac{\\Omega}{F}\\left(\\sigma + \\frac{2\\gamma}{R}\\right)\\right)$$\n    $$\\Delta U = \\frac{2\\Omega}{F}\\left(\\sigma + \\frac{2\\gamma}{R}\\right)$$\n\n### Part 2: Calculation of Dissipated Energy\n\nThe energy dissipated in a thermodynamic cycle is the net work done on the system, which is equivalent to the area enclosed by the cycle on a voltage-charge ($U$-$Q$) diagram.\nThe problem specifies a full lithiation–delithiation cycle over the same plateau charge interval $Q_{\\mathrm{pl}}$. The process is:\n1.  Charging (delithiation): A charge of $Q_{\\mathrm{pl}}$ is passed at a constant voltage $U_{\\mathrm{D}}$.

This exercise  translates the physical concept of OCV hysteresis into a tangible engineering problem: state-of-charge ($SOC$) estimation error in a Battery Management System (BMS). By quantifying the error that arises when a simplified BMS model ignores the path-dependent nature of the OCV, you will appreciate why high-fidelity models are essential for accurate battery monitoring and control.",

            "problem": "A lithium-ion intercalation cell exhibits an Open Circuit Voltage–State of Charge (OCV–SOC) relationship with measurable path dependence (hysteresis) in the mid–State of Charge region. Consider a hypothetical cell whose equilibrium Open Circuit Voltage (OCV) as a function of the lithium fraction in the active material (taken here as State of Charge, so $x \\in (0,1)$) is approximated by a Nernst-like form,\n$$U_{\\mathrm{eq}}(x) = U^{\\circ} + \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{x}{1-x}\\right),$$\nwhere $U^{\\circ}$ is a reference potential, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $F$ is the Faraday constant. In the mid–State of Charge region $x \\in [0.4,0.7]$ the cell exhibits hysteresis such that the measured Open Circuit Voltage after approaching the State of Charge by charging (insertion path) is elevated by a constant offset relative to the equilibrium curve, while after approaching by discharging (extraction path) it is lowered by the same offset:\n$$U_{\\mathrm{in}}(x) = U_{\\mathrm{eq}}(x) + H,\\qquad U_{\\mathrm{out}}(x) = U_{\\mathrm{eq}}(x) - H,$$\nfor $x \\in [0.4,0.7]$, with a constant hysteresis magnitude $H$.\n\nA Battery Management System (BMS) that ignores hysteresis uses the single-valued equilibrium function $U_{\\mathrm{eq}}(x)$ to estimate State of Charge from an OCV measurement by inversion of $U_{\\mathrm{eq}}(x)$. Assume a rest measurement is taken after the cell was charged into the mid–State of Charge region, so the measured OCV is $U_{\\mathrm{meas}} = U_{\\mathrm{in}}(x_{\\mathrm{true}})$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the State of Charge (SOC) estimation error that arises when a Battery Management System (BMS) ignores OCV hysteresis. The validation of the problem statement confirms that it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and internally consistent. We may therefore proceed with a rigorous solution.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the discrepancy between the cell's actual voltage and the model used by the BMS. The cell's true SOC is $x_{\\mathrm{true}}$, and it has been brought to this state by charging. Therefore, its measured Open Circuit Voltage (OCV) is on the insertion (charging) branch of the hysteresis loop, given by $U_{\\mathrm{in}}(x)$. According to the problem statement, this voltage is:\n$$U_{\\mathrm{meas}} = U_{\\mathrm{in}}(x_{\\mathrm{true}}) = U_{\\mathrm{eq}}(x_{\\mathrm{true}}) + H$$\nHere, $U_{\\mathrm{eq}}(x)$ is the equilibrium OCV, and $H$ is the constant hysteresis offset.\n\nThe BMS, however, is unaware of hysteresis and operates under the assumption that the measured voltage corresponds to the equilibrium curve. It estimates the SOC, denoted as $x_{\\mathrm{hat}}$, by inverting the equilibrium function $U_{\\mathrm{eq}}(x)$. Thus, the BMS solves the following equation for $x_{\\mathrm{hat}}$:\n$$U_{\\mathrm{meas}} = U_{\\mathrm{eq}}(x_{\\mathrm{hat}})$$\n\nBy equating the two expressions for $U_{\\mathrm{meas}}$, we establish the central relationship between the true SOC $x_{\\mathrm{true}}$ and the estimated SOC $x_{\\mathrm{hat}}$:\n$$U_{\\mathrm{eq}}(x_{\\mathrm{hat}}) = U_{\\mathrm{eq}}(x_{\\mathrm{true}}) + H$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given Nernst-like form for the equilibrium voltage, $U_{\\mathrm{eq}}(x) = U^{\\circ} + \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{x}{1-x}\\right)$:\n$$U^{\\circ} + \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_{\\mathrm{hat}}}{1-x_{\\mathrm{hat}}}\\right) = \\left(U^{\\circ} + \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_{\\mathrm{true}}}{1-x_{\\mathrm{true}}}\\right)\\right) + H$$\n\nThe reference potential $U^{\\circ}$ cancels from both sides, yielding:\n$$\\frac{RT}{F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_{\\mathrm{hat}}}{1-x_{\\mathrm{hat}}}\\right) = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_{\\mathrm{true}}}{1-x_{\\mathrm{true}}}\\right) + H$$\n\nTo solve for $x_{\\mathrm{hat}}$, we first isolate the logarithmic term:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{x_{\\mathrm{hat}}}{1-x_{\\mathrm{hat}}}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_{\\mathrm{true}}}{1-x_{\\mathrm{true}}}\\right) + \\frac{H F}{RT}$$\n\nThis equation shows that the hysteresis voltage $H$ introduces an additive error in the logit-transformed SOC, where the logit function is $\\mathrm{logit}(p) = \\ln(p/(1-p))$. To find $x_{\\mathrm{hat}}$, we exponentiate both sides:\n$$\\frac{x_{\\mathrm{hat}}}{1-x_{\\mathrm{hat}}} = \\exp\\left(\\ln\\left(\\frac{x_{\\mathrm{true}}}{1-x_{\\mathrm{true}}}\\right) + \\frac{H F}{RT}\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{x_{\\mathrm{hat}}}{1-x_{\\mathrm{hat}}} = \\exp\\left(\\ln\\left(\\frac{x_{\\mathrm{true}}}{1-x_{\\mathrm{true}}}\\right)\\right) \\cdot \\exp\\left(\\frac{H F}{RT}\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{x_{\\mathrm{hat}}}{1-x_{\\mathrm{hat}}} = \\left(\\frac{x_{\\mathrm{true}}}{1-x_{\\mathrm{true}}}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{H F}{RT}\\right)$$\n\nLet us define a quantity $A \\equiv \\left(\\frac{x_{\\mathrm{true}}}{1-x_{\\mathrm{true}}}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{H F}{RT}\\right)$. The equation becomes $\\frac{x_{\\mathrm{hat}}}{1-x_{\\mathrm{hat}}} = A$. We can solve for $x_{\\mathrm{hat}}$:\n$$x_{\\mathrm{hat}} = A(1-x_{\\mathrm{hat}}) = A - A x_{\\mathrm{hat}}$$\n$$x_{\\mathrm{hat}}(1+A) = A$$\n$$x_{\\mathrm{hat}} = \\frac{A}{1+A}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$x_{\\mathrm{true}} = 0.55$\n$H = 0.012\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n$T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n$R = 8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n$F = 96485\\,\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}}$\n\nFirst, we compute the thermal voltage term, $\\frac{RT}{F}$:\n$$\\frac{RT}{F} = \\frac{(8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}})(298\\,\\mathrm{K})}{96485\\,\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}}} \\approx 0.025679\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the exponent in the expression for $A$:\n$$\\frac{H F}{RT} = \\frac{H}{RT/F} \\approx \\frac{0.012\\,\\mathrm{V}}{0.025679\\,\\mathrm{V}} \\approx 0.46730$$\n\nNow we can compute A:\n$$A = \\left(\\frac{0.55}{1-0.55}\\right) \\exp(0.46730) = \\left(\\frac{0.55}{0.45}\\right) \\exp(0.46730)$$\n$$A \\approx (1.2222\\ldots) \\cdot (1.59567\\ldots) \\approx 1.95013$$\n\nUsing this value of $A$, we find the estimated SOC, $x_{\\mathrm{hat}}$:\n$$x_{\\mathrm{hat}} = \\frac{A}{1+A} \\approx \\frac{1.95013}{1+1.95013} = \\frac{1.95013}{2.95013} \\approx 0.66103$$\n\nThe SOC estimation error, $e$, is defined as $e \\equiv x_{\\mathrm{hat}} - x_{\\mathrm{true}}$.\n$$e \\approx 0.66103 - 0.55 = 0.11103$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The fifth significant figure is $3$, so we round down.\n$$e \\approx 0.1110$$\n\nThis positive error indicates that because the measured voltage was elevated by hysteresis on the charging path, the BMS overestimated the State of Charge.",
