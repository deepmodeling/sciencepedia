It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Calculation\n\nThe solution proceeds in three stages as requested: derivation of the diffuse layer capacitance, formulation of the total capacitance, and computation of the specified ratio.\n\n**Stage 1: Derivation of Diffuse-Layer Capacitance at PZC**\n\nWe begin with the one-dimensional Poisson equation for the electrostatic potential $\\psi(x)$ in the electrolyte, where $x$ is the distance normal to the planar electrode surface:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\epsilon}\n$$\nHere, $\\rho(x)$ is the local space charge density and $\\epsilon$ is the absolute permittivity of the electrolyte. For a symmetric $z:z$ electrolyte (e.g., $\\mathrm{NaCl}$, where $z=1$), the charge density is given by the sum of ionic charges:\n$$\n\\rho(x) = ze(n_{+}(x) - n_{-}(x))\n$$\nwhere $z$ is the valence number of the ions, $e$ is the elementary charge, and $n_{+}(x)$ and $n_{-}(x)$ are the local number concentrations of cations and anions, respectively.\n\nAccording to Boltzmann statistics, the ion concentrations are related to the local potential $\\psi(x)$ and the bulk concentration $n_{0}$ by:\n$$\nn_{+}(x) = n_{0}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{ze\\psi(x)}{k_{B}T}\\right) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad n_{-}(x) = n_{0}\\exp\\left(\\frac{ze\\psi(x)}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\rho(x)$ gives:\n$$\n\\rho(x) = zen_{0}\\left[\\exp\\left(-\\frac{ze\\psi(x)}{k_{B}T}\\right) - \\exp\\left(\\frac{ze\\psi(x)}{k_{B}T}\\right)\\right] = -2zen_{0}\\sinh\\left(\\frac{ze\\psi(x)}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nThis leads to the full Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} = \\frac{2zen_{0}}{\\epsilon}\\sinh\\left(\\frac{ze\\psi(x)}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states to use the linearized framework, which is valid for small potentials, i.e., $|\\frac{ze\\psi}{k_{B}T}| \\ll 1$. In this limit, $\\sinh(u) \\approx u$, so the PB equation linearizes to:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} = \\frac{2z^2e^2n_{0}}{\\epsilon k_{B}T}\\psi(x)\n$$\nThe Debye screening length, $\\lambda_{D}$, is defined as $\\lambda_{D}^{-2} = \\frac{2z^2e^2n_{0}}{\\epsilon k_{B}T}$. Using this definition, the linearized PB equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{D}^2}\\psi(x)\n$$\nThe general solution to this second-order ordinary differential equation is:\n$$\n\\psi(x) = A\\exp(-x/\\lambda_{D}) + B\\exp(x/\\lambda_{D})\n$$\nWe apply two boundary conditions. First, far from the electrode ($x \\to \\infty$), the potential must decay to the bulk potential, which is defined as zero: $\\psi(\\infty) = 0$. This requires $B=0$. Second, at the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP), which we define as $x=0$, the potential is the diffuse layer potential, $\\psi_d$. Thus, $\\psi(0) = \\psi_d$, which gives $A=\\psi_d$. The potential profile in the diffuse layer is therefore:\n$$\n\\psi(x) = \\psi_d \\exp(-x/\\lambda_{D})\n$$\nThe total charge per unit area in the diffuse layer, $\\sigma_d$, must balance the charge on the electrode, $\\sigma_m$, such that $\\sigma_m = -\\sigma_d$. The diffuse layer charge is found by integrating the charge density from the OHP to infinity:\n$$\n\\sigma_d = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\rho(x) \\,dx = -\\epsilon \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} \\,dx = -\\epsilon \\left[\\frac{d\\psi}{dx}\\right]_{0}^{\\infty}\n$$\nThe derivative of the potential is $\\frac{d\\psi}{dx} = -\\frac{\\psi_d}{\\lambda_{D}}\\exp(-x/\\lambda_{D})$. Evaluating this at the limits:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\psi}{dx}\\bigg|_{x\\to\\infty} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{d\\psi}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0} = -\\frac{\\psi_d}{\\lambda_{D}}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the integral for $\\sigma_d$:\n$$\n\\sigma_d = -\\epsilon \\left(0 - \\left(-\\frac{\\psi_d}{\\lambda_D}\\right)\\right) = -\\frac{\\epsilon \\psi_d}{\\lambda_D}\n$$\nThe charge on the metal electrode is $\\sigma_m = -\\sigma_d = \\frac{\\epsilon \\psi_d}{\\lambda_D}$. The differential capacitance of the diffuse layer, $C_D$, is defined as the rate of change of electrode charge with respect to the potential drop across the diffuse layer, $\\psi_d$:\n$$\nC_D = \\frac{d\\sigma_m}{d\\psi_d} = \\frac{d}{d\\psi_d}\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon \\psi_d}{\\lambda_D}\\right) = \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\lambda_D}\n$$\nWithin the linearized approximation, the capacitance is independent of potential. Thus, the diffuse-layer differential capacitance per unit area at PZC is $C_{D}(\\mathrm{PZC}) = \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\lambda_{D}}$.\n\n**Stage 2: Total Interfacial Capacitance**\n\nThe total interfacial capacitance, $C_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, is modeled as the series combination of the compact (Helmholtz) layer capacitance, $C_H$, and the diffuse layer capacitance, $C_D$. The relationship for capacitors in series is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{C_{\\mathrm{tot}}} = \\frac{1}{C_H} + \\frac{1}{C_D(\\mathrm{PZC})}\n$$\nSolving for $C_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ yields:\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\left( \\frac{C_D(\\mathrm{PZC}) + C_H}{C_H C_D(\\mathrm{PZC})} \\right)^{-1} = \\frac{C_H C_D(\\mathrm{PZC})}{C_H + C_D(\\mathrm{PZC})}\n$$\n\n**Stage 3: Calculation of the Dimensionless Ratio $R$**\n\nThe dimensionless ratio $R$ is defined as:\n$$\nR \\equiv \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{C_{D}(\\mathrm{PZC})}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_{\\mathrm{tot}}$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{1}{C_{D}(\\mathrm{PZC})} \\left( \\frac{C_H C_D(\\mathrm{PZC})}{C_H + C_D(\\mathrm{PZC})} \\right) = \\frac{C_H}{C_H + C_D(\\mathrm{PZC})}\n$$\nTo compute the numerical value of $R$, we first convert all given quantities to a coherent system of SI units ($\\mathrm{m}$, $\\mathrm{F}$).\n\nThe compact layer capacitance is given as $C_{H} = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{F/cm^2}$.\n$$\nC_H = 20 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{F} \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m}}\\right)^2 = 20 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{F} \\times \\frac{1}{10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2} = 20 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{F/m^2} = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{F/m^2}\n$$\nThe Debye length is $\\lambda_{D} = 1\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 1 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nThe absolute permittivity of the electrolyte is $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_r \\epsilon_0$:\n$$\n\\epsilon = 78.4 \\times (8.8541878128\\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}) \\approx 6.941683245 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}\n$$\nNow we calculate the diffuse layer capacitance, $C_{D}(\\mathrm{PZC})$:\n$$\nC_{D}(\\mathrm{PZC}) = \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\lambda_{D}} = \\frac{6.941683245 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}}{1 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 0.6941683245\\,\\mathrm{F/m^2}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{C_H}{C_H + C_D(\\mathrm{PZC})} = \\frac{0.2\\,\\mathrm{F/m^2}}{0.2\\,\\mathrm{F/m^2} + 0.6941683245\\,\\mathrm{F/m^2}} = \\frac{0.2}{0.8941683245} \\approx 0.22367139\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested gives $0.2237$.",

Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will now proceed with a detailed solution.\n\nThe solution is developed in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n### Part 1: Governing Equation, Potential Profile, Surface Charge, and Capacitance\n\nThe starting point is the one-dimensional Poisson equation, which relates the electrostatic potential $\\psi(x)$ to the local space charge density $\\rho_e(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\rho_e}{\\varepsilon}\n$$\nThe charge density $\\rho_e$ arises from the imbalance in the concentrations of cations ($c_+$) and anions ($c_-$) of a symmetric $z{:}z$ electrolyte:\n$$\n\\rho_e = z e c_+ - z e c_- = z e (c_+ - c_-)\n$$\nIn thermal equilibrium, the local ion concentrations are related to the local potential via the Boltzmann distribution:\n$$\nc_+(x) = c_{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{ze\\psi(x)}{k_B T}\\right) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad c_-(x) = c_{\\infty} \\exp\\left(+\\frac{ze\\psi(x)}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\rho_e$ yields:\n$$\n\\rho_e(x) = ze c_{\\infty} \\left[\\exp\\left(-\\frac{ze\\psi}{k_B T}\\right) - \\exp\\left(\\frac{ze\\psi}{k_B T}\\right)\\right] = -2 z e c_{\\infty} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{ze\\psi}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nCombining this with the Poisson equation gives the full Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} = \\frac{2 z e c_{\\infty}}{\\varepsilon} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{ze\\psi}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that we are in the small-potential (Debye-Hückel) regime, where $|\\psi_s| \\ll k_B T / (ze)$. This implies that the argument of the sinh function, $ze\\psi/(k_B T)$, is much smaller than $1$ everywhere within the pore. We can therefore linearize the sinh function: $\\sinh(u) \\approx u$ for small $u$. This gives the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann (LPB) equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} = \\frac{2 z e c_{\\infty}}{\\varepsilon} \\left(\\frac{ze\\psi}{k_B T}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2 z^2 e^2 c_{\\infty}}{\\varepsilon k_B T}\\right) \\psi\n$$\nThe term in parentheses is the square of the inverse Debye screening length, $\\kappa^2$:\n$$\n\\kappa^2 = \\frac{2 z^2 e^2 c_{\\infty}}{\\varepsilon k_B T}\n$$\nwhere $\\kappa = 1/\\lambda_D$. The governing equation for the potential is thus:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} = \\kappa^2 \\psi\n$$\nWe solve this equation in a coordinate system where $x=0$ is the midplane of the slit and the walls are located at $x = \\pm r/2$. The general solution to this second-order ODE is:\n$$\n\\psi(x) = A \\cosh(\\kappa x) + B \\sinh(\\kappa x)\n$$\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1.  Symmetry at the midplane ($x=0$): The electric field must be zero due to symmetry, so $(d\\psi/dx)|_{x=0} = 0$. Differentiating the general solution gives $d\\psi/dx = A\\kappa\\sinh(\\kappa x) + B\\kappa\\cosh(\\kappa x)$. At $x=0$, this becomes $B\\kappa = 0$, which implies $B=0$. The solution must be an even function of $x$: $\\psi(x) = A \\cosh(\\kappa x)$.\n2.  Potential at the walls ($x=\\pm r/2$): The potential is fixed at $\\psi_s$: $\\psi(\\pm r/2) = \\psi_s$. Applying this condition: $\\psi_s = A \\cosh(\\kappa r/2)$. We solve for the constant $A$: $A = \\psi_s / \\cosh(\\kappa r/2)$.\n\nSubstituting $A$ back, the final expression for the potential profile is:\n$$\n\\psi(x) = \\psi_s \\frac{\\cosh(\\kappa x)}{\\cosh(\\kappa r/2)}\n$$\nNext, we determine the surface charge density $\\sigma$ on the inner wall surface (e.g., at $x=r/2$). From Gauss's law at the conductor-electrolyte interface, $\\sigma$ is given by the jump in the electric displacement field. This leads to $\\sigma = \\varepsilon (d\\psi/dx)|_{x=r/2}$. We first compute the derivative of the potential:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\psi}{dx} = \\psi_s \\frac{\\kappa \\sinh(\\kappa x)}{\\cosh(\\kappa r/2)}\n$$\nEvaluating this at the wall $x=r/2$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{d\\psi}{dx}\\right)_{x=r/2} = \\psi_s \\frac{\\kappa \\sinh(\\kappa r/2)}{\\cosh(\\kappa r/2)} = \\psi_s \\kappa \\tanh(\\kappa r/2)\n$$\nThe surface charge density is therefore:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\varepsilon \\kappa \\psi_s \\tanh(\\kappa r/2)\n$$\nThe differential capacitance per internal wall area, $C_{\\mathrm{wall}}$, is defined as the derivative of the surface charge with respect to the surface potential:\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{wall}} = \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial \\psi_s} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\psi_s} \\left[ \\varepsilon \\kappa \\psi_s \\tanh(\\kappa r/2) \\right]\n$$\nSince $\\sigma$ is linear in $\\psi_s$ in this model, this simplifies to:\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{wall}}(r, \\lambda_D) = \\varepsilon \\kappa \\tanh(\\kappa r/2) = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\lambda_D} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{r}{2\\lambda_D}\\right)\n$$\n\n### Part 2: Criterion for Significant Double Layer Overlap\n\nFor a single, isolated planar electrode, the potential decays exponentially away from the surface as $\\psi(x) = \\psi_s \\exp(-\\kappa x) = \\psi_s \\exp(-x/\\lambda_D)$. The Debye length $\\lambda_D$ is the characteristic length scale over which the potential decays, and it represents the effective thickness of the electric double layer (EDL).\n\nIn a slit pore of width $r$, two EDLs form, one at each wall. These two EDLs \"overlap\" when the separation between the walls is not large enough for the potential from each wall to decay to the bulk value (zero) in the intervening space. The interaction is most pronounced at the pore's midplane, a distance $r/2$ from each wall.\n\nSignificant overlap occurs when this distance, $r/2$, is comparable to or smaller than the characteristic decay length $\\lambda_D$. This physical reasoning leads to a quantitative criterion for significant overlap:\n$$\n\\frac{r}{2}  \\lambda_D \\quad \\text{or} \\quad r  2\\lambda_D\n$$\nThis inequality indicates that the pore width is less than twice the Debye length, a condition under which the two EDLs cannot be considered independent and their interaction significantly alters the potential distribution and capacitance.\n\n### Part 3: Normalized Capacitance\n\nThe non-overlapping reference capacitance per internal wall area is defined in the limit of infinite pore width, $r \\to \\infty$. In this limit, the walls are infinitely far apart, and the capacitance per unit area of each wall should approach that of an isolated electrode.\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{wall}}(r\\to \\infty,\\lambda_{D}) = \\lim_{r\\to\\infty} C_{\\mathrm{wall}}(r, \\lambda_D) = \\lim_{r\\to\\infty} \\left[ \\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\lambda_D} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{r}{2\\lambda_D}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nAs $r \\to \\infty$, the argument of the hyperbolic tangent $r/(2\\lambda_D) \\to \\infty$. Since $\\lim_{u\\to\\infty} \\tanh(u) = 1$, the reference capacitance is:\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{wall}}(r\\to\\infty, \\lambda_D) = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\lambda_D}\n$$\nThis is the well-known result for the capacitance of a planar electrode in the Debye-Hückel limit.\n\nTo quantify the effect of overlap, we derive the normalized capacitance, which is the ratio of the capacitance in the slit pore to the reference capacitance:\n$$\n\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{wall}}(r, \\lambda_D)}{C_{\\mathrm{wall}}(r\\to\\infty, \\lambda_D)} = \\frac{\\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\lambda_D} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{r}{2\\lambda_D}\\right)}{\\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\lambda_D}}\n$$\nCanceling the common factor $\\varepsilon/\\lambda_D$, we obtain the final closed-form expression exclusively in terms of $r$ and $\\lambda_D$:\n$$\n\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{wall}}(r, \\lambda_D)}{C_{\\mathrm{wall}}(r\\to\\infty, \\lambda_D)} = \\tanh\\left(\\frac{r}{2\\lambda_D}\\right)\n$$\nThis expression captures the confinement effect on capacitance. For wide pores ($r \\gg \\lambda_D$), the ratio approaches $1$, indicating no overlap. For narrow pores ($r \\ll \\lambda_D$), the capacitance is significantly reduced compared to the non-overlapping case.",

At thermodynamic equilibrium, $\\bar{\\mu}_i$ must be constant throughout the system. The electrochemical potential is composed of a chemical part, $\\mu_i$, and an electrical part, $z_i e \\psi(x)$, where $z_i$ is the valency of the ion ($z_+=+1, z_-=-1$), $e$ is the elementary charge, and $\\psi(x)$ is the local electrostatic potential.\n$$ \\bar{\\mu}_i(x) = \\mu_i(x) + z_i e \\psi(x) = \\text{constant} $$\nThe chemical potential for a species in a lattice gas mixture is derived from the configurational entropy. For a three-component system of cations, anions, and vacant sites (solvent), occupying site fractions $X_+ = a^3 n_+$, $X_- = a^3 n_-$, and $X_v = 1 - (X_+ + X_-)$, the chemical potential of species $i$ is given by $\\mu_i = \\mu_i^{\\ominus} + k_B T \\ln(X_i / X_v)$. The local volume fraction is $\\phi(x) = X_+(x) + X_-(x) = a^3(n_+(x)+n_-(x))$.\nThus, for cations and anions:\n$$ \\bar{\\mu}_+(x) = \\mu_+^{\\ominus} + k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{a^3 n_+(x)}{1 - \\phi(x)}\\right) + e \\psi(x) $$\n$$ \\bar{\\mu}_-(x) = \\mu_-^{\\ominus} + k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{a^3 n_-(x)}{1 - \\phi(x)}\\right) - e \\psi(x) $$\nwhere $\\mu_+^{\\ominus}$ and $\\mu_-^{\\ominus}$ are standard chemical potentials.\n\nWe equate the electrochemical potential at any position $x$ to its value in the bulk reservoir (denoted by $x \\to \\infty$), where $\\psi(\\infty) = 0$, $n_+(\\infty) = n_-(\\infty) = n_{\\infty}$, and the volume fraction is $\\phi_{\\infty} = 2 a^3 n_{\\infty}$.\n\nFor cations ($z_+=+1$):\n$$ \\mu_+^{\\ominus} + k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{a^3 n_+(x)}{1 - \\phi(x)}\\right) + e \\psi(x) = \\mu_+^{\\ominus} + k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{a^3 n_{\\infty}}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty}}\\right) $$\nRearranging gives:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{a^3 n_+(x)}{1 - \\phi(x)}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{a^3 n_{\\infty}}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty}}\\right) - \\frac{e\\psi(x)}{k_B T} $$\nExponentiating both sides yields the implicit relation for $n_+(x)$:\n$$ n_+(\\psi) = \\frac{n_{\\infty}}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty}} (1 - \\phi(\\psi)) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{e\\psi}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nSimilarly for anions ($z_-=-1$):\n$$ n_-(\\psi) = \\frac{n_{\\infty}}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty}} (1 - \\phi(\\psi)) \\exp\\left(\\frac{e\\psi}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nTo find explicit relations, we first solve for $\\phi(\\psi) = a^3(n_+(\\psi) + n_-(\\psi))$:\n$$ \\phi(\\psi) = a^3 \\left[ \\frac{n_{\\infty}}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty}} (1 - \\phi(\\psi)) \\left( \\exp\\left(-\\frac{e\\psi}{k_B T}\\right) + \\exp\\left(\\frac{e\\psi}{k_B T}\\right) \\right) \\right] $$\nUsing the definitions $\\phi_{\\infty} = 2 a^3 n_{\\infty}$ and $\\cosh(y) = (\\exp(y) + \\exp(-y))/2$:\n$$ \\phi(\\psi) = \\frac{2 a^3 n_{\\infty}}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty}} (1 - \\phi(\\psi)) \\cosh\\left(\\frac{e\\psi}{k_B T}\\right) = \\frac{\\phi_{\\infty}}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty}} (1 - \\phi(\\psi)) \\cosh\\left(\\frac{e\\psi}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nSolving for $\\phi(\\psi)$:\n$$ \\phi(\\psi)\\left[1 + \\frac{\\phi_{\\infty}}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty}}\\cosh\\left(\\frac{e\\psi}{k_B T}\\right)\\right] = \\frac{\\phi_{\\infty}}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty}}\\cosh\\left(\\frac{e\\psi}{k_B T}\\right) $$\n$$ \\phi(\\psi) = \\frac{\\phi_{\\infty}\\cosh(e\\psi/k_B T)}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty} + \\phi_{\\infty}\\cosh(e\\psi/k_B T)} $$\nWe can find an expression for the term $(1 - \\phi(\\psi))$:\n$$ 1 - \\phi(\\psi) = 1 - \\frac{\\phi_{\\infty}\\cosh(e\\psi/k_B T)}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty} + \\phi_{\\infty}\\cosh(e\\psi/k_B T)} = \\frac{1 - \\phi_{\\infty}}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty} + \\phi_{\\infty}\\cosh(e\\psi/k_B T)} $$\nSubstituting this back into the expressions for $n_+(\\psi)$ and $n_-(\\psi)$:\n$$ n_+(\\psi) = \\frac{n_{\\infty}}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty}} \\left( \\frac{1 - \\phi_{\\infty}}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty} + \\phi_{\\infty}\\cosh\\left(\\frac{e\\psi}{k_B T}\\right)} \\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{e\\psi}{k_B T}\\right) $$\n$$ n_+(\\psi) = \\frac{n_{\\infty} \\exp(-e\\psi/k_B T)}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty} + \\phi_{\\infty}\\cosh(e\\psi/k_B T)} $$\n$$ n_-(\\psi) = \\frac{n_{\\infty} \\exp(e\\psi/k_B T)}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty} + \\phi_{\\infty}\\cosh(e\\psi/k_B T)} $$\nThese equations can be rewritten using $\\phi_{\\infty} = 2a^3 n_{\\infty}$ and $\\cosh(y)-1 = 2\\sinh^2(y/2)$:\n$$ n_{\\pm}(\\psi) = \\frac{n_{\\infty} \\exp(\\mp e\\psi/k_B T)}{1 + 2a^3 n_{\\infty} (\\cosh(e\\psi/k_B T) - 1)} = \\frac{n_{\\infty} \\exp(\\mp e\\psi/k_B T)}{1 + 4a^3 n_{\\infty} \\sinh^2(e\\psi/2k_B T)} $$\n\n### Upper Bound of Counterion Density\n\nThe electrode is negatively polarized, so $\\psi  0$. The counterions are the cations (positive charge). We must examine the behavior of $n_+(\\psi)$ as the potential becomes very large and negative, i.e., $\\psi \\to -\\infty$.\nLet $u = e\\psi / k_B T$. As $\\psi \\to -\\infty$, $u \\to -\\infty$.\nIn this limit, $\\exp(-u) \\to \\infty$ and $\\cosh(u) = (\\exp(u) + \\exp(-u))/2 \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\exp(-u)$.\nSubstituting this asymptotic behavior into the expression for $n_+(\\psi)$:\n$$ \\lim_{\\psi \\to -\\infty} n_+(\\psi) = \\lim_{u \\to -\\infty} \\frac{n_{\\infty} \\exp(-u)}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty} + \\phi_{\\infty}\\cosh(u)} $$\n$$ \\approx \\lim_{u \\to -\\infty} \\frac{n_{\\infty} \\exp(-u)}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty} + \\phi_{\\infty} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\exp(-u)} $$\nAs $\\exp(-u) \\to \\infty$, the constant terms in the denominator become negligible compared to the exponential term:\n$$ \\lim_{\\psi \\to -\\infty} n_+(\\psi) \\approx \\lim_{u \\to -\\infty} \\frac{n_{\\infty} \\exp(-u)}{\\frac{\\phi_{\\infty}}{2}\\exp(-u)} = \\frac{2n_{\\infty}}{\\phi_{\\infty}} $$\nUsing the definition $\\phi_{\\infty} = 2 a^3 n_{\\infty}$:\n$$ \\lim_{\\psi \\to -\\infty} n_+(\\psi) = \\frac{2n_{\\infty}}{2 a^3 n_{\\infty}} = \\frac{1}{a^3} $$\nThis demonstrates that steric exclusion imposes a finite upper bound on the counterion concentration, which is the maximum possible packing density of one ion per lattice site. This contrasts sharply with the standard Poisson-Boltzmann model where the concentration would grow exponentially without bound. The condition $\\phi(x) \\to 1$ is met in this limit, as $\\lim_{\\psi \\to -\\infty} \\phi(\\psi) = \\lim_{u \\to -\\infty} \\frac{\\phi_{\\infty}\\cosh(u)}{1-\\phi_{\\infty}+\\phi_{\\infty}\\cosh(u)} = 1$.\n\n### Saturation Potential\n\nSaturation is defined by the condition that the local volume fraction at the surface reaches $\\phi(\\psi_{\\mathrm{sat}}) = \\phi^{\\star} = 0.95$. We use the derived expression for $\\phi(\\psi)$ to solve for the corresponding potential $\\psi_{\\mathrm{sat}}$.\n$$ \\phi^{\\star} = \\frac{\\phi_{\\infty}\\cosh(e\\psi_{\\mathrm{sat}}/k_B T)}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty} + \\phi_{\\infty}\\cosh(e\\psi_{\\mathrm{sat}}/k_B T)} $$\nLet $u_{\\mathrm{sat}} = e\\psi_{\\mathrm{sat}}/k_B T$. We solve for $\\cosh(u_{\\mathrm{sat}})$:\n$$ \\phi^{\\star}(1 - \\phi_{\\infty}) + \\phi^{\\star}\\phi_{\\infty}\\cosh(u_{\\mathrm{sat}}) = \\phi_{\\infty}\\cosh(u_{\\mathrm{sat}}) $$\n$$ \\phi^{\\star}(1 - \\phi_{\\infty}) = \\cosh(u_{\\mathrm{sat}})(\\phi_{\\infty} - \\phi^{\\star}\\phi_{\\infty}) = \\cosh(u_{\\mathrm{sat}})\\phi_{\\infty}(1 - \\phi^{\\star}) $$\n$$ \\cosh(u_{\\mathrm{sat}}) = \\frac{\\phi^{\\star}(1 - \\phi_{\\infty})}{\\phi_{\\infty}(1 - \\phi^{\\star})} $$\nSince the electrode is negatively polarized, $\\psi_{\\mathrm{sat}}  0$, which implies $u_{\\mathrm{sat}}  0$. We therefore take the negative solution of the inverse hyperbolic cosine:\n$$ u_{\\mathrm{sat}} = \\frac{e\\psi_{\\mathrm{sat}}}{k_B T} = -\\arccosh\\left(\\frac{\\phi^{\\star}(1 - \\phi_{\\infty})}{\\phi_{\\infty}(1 - \\phi^{\\star})}\\right) $$\nThe magnitude of the surface potential is $|\\psi_{\\mathrm{sat}}| = -\\psi_{\\mathrm{sat}}$.\n$$ |\\psi_{\\mathrm{sat}}| = -\\frac{k_B T}{e} u_{\\mathrm{sat}} = \\frac{k_B T}{e} \\arccosh\\left(\\frac{\\phi^{\\star}(1 - \\phi_{\\infty})}{\\phi_{\\infty}(1 - \\phi^{\\star})}\\right) $$\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\n\nFirst, we calculate the bulk volume fraction $\\phi_{\\infty} = 2 a^3 n_{\\infty}$ using the provided parameters in SI units.\n- $a = 0.5 \\,\\mathrm{nm} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-9} \\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $n_{\\infty} = 1 \\,\\mathrm{mol/L} = 1 \\frac{\\mathrm{mol}}{\\mathrm{L}} \\times \\frac{N_A \\,\\mathrm{ions}}{1 \\,\\mathrm{mol}} \\times \\frac{1 \\,\\mathrm{L}}{10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{m}^3} = 1000 N_A \\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n- $n_{\\infty} = 1000 \\times (6.022\\,140\\,76 \\times 10^{23}) \\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3} = 6.022\\,140\\,76 \\times 10^{26} \\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n$$ \\phi_{\\infty} = 2 \\times (0.5 \\times 10^{-9})^3 \\times (6.022\\,140\\,76 \\times 10^{26}) = 2 \\times (1.25 \\times 10^{-28}) \\times (6.022\\,140\\,76 \\times 10^{26}) $$\n$$ \\phi_{\\infty} = 0.150\\,553\\,519 $$\nNext, we calculate the argument of the $\\arccosh$ function:\n$$ X = \\frac{\\phi^{\\star}(1 - \\phi_{\\infty})}{\\phi_{\\infty}(1 - \\phi^{\\star})} = \\frac{0.95 \\times (1 - 0.150\\,553\\,519)}{0.150\\,553\\,519 \\times (1 - 0.95)} = \\frac{0.95 \\times 0.849\\,446\\,481}{0.150\\,553\\,519 \\times 0.05} $$\n$$ X = \\frac{0.806\\,974\\,157}{0.007\\,527\\,675\\,95} \\approx 107.199\\,929 $$\nNow, we find the value of $\\arccosh(X)$:\n$$ \\arccosh(X) = \\ln(X + \\sqrt{X^2 - 1}) \\approx \\ln(107.199\\,929 + \\sqrt{107.199\\,929^2 - 1}) \\approx 5.367\\,831\\,6 $$\nThe thermal voltage $V_T = k_B T / e$ is:\n$$ V_T = \\frac{(1.380\\,649 \\times 10^{-23} \\,\\mathrm{J/K}) \\times (298 \\,\\mathrm{K})}{1.602\\,176\\,634 \\times 10^{-19} \\,\\mathrm{C}} \\approx 0.025\\,692\\,569 \\,\\mathrm{V} $$\nFinally, we compute the magnitude of the saturation potential:\n$$ |\\psi_{\\mathrm{sat}}| = V_T \\times \\arccosh(X) \\approx (0.025\\,692\\,569) \\times (5.367\\,831\\,6) \\approx 0.137916\\,\\mathrm{V} $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $0.1379 \\,\\mathrm{V}$.",
