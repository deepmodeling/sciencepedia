It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Calculation\n\nThe solution proceeds in three stages as requested: derivation of the diffuse layer capacitance, formulation of the total capacitance, and computation of the specified ratio.\n\n**Stage 1: Derivation of Diffuse-Layer Capacitance at PZC**\n\nWe begin with the one-dimensional Poisson equation for the electrostatic potential $\\psi(x)$ in the electrolyte, where $x$ is the distance normal to the planar electrode surface:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\epsilon}\n$$\nHere, $\\rho(x)$ is the local space charge density and $\\epsilon$ is the absolute permittivity of the electrolyte. For a symmetric $z:z$ electrolyte (e.g., $\\mathrm{NaCl}$, where $z=1$), the charge density is given by the sum of ionic charges:\n$$\n\\rho(x) = ze(n_{+}(x) - n_{-}(x))\n$$\nwhere $z$ is the valence number of the ions, $e$ is the elementary charge, and $n_{+}(x)$ and $n_{-}(x)$ are the local number concentrations of cations and anions, respectively.\n\nAccording to Boltzmann statistics, the ion concentrations are related to the local potential $\\psi(x)$ and the bulk concentration $n_{0}$ by:\n$$\nn_{+}(x) = n_{0}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{ze\\psi(x)}{k_{B}T}\\right) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad n_{-}(x) = n_{0}\\exp\\left(\\frac{ze\\psi(x)}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\rho(x)$ gives:\n$$\n\\rho(x) = zen_{0}\\left[\\exp\\left(-\\frac{ze\\psi(x)}{k_{B}T}\\right) - \\exp\\left(\\frac{ze\\psi(x)}{k_{B}T}\\right)\\right] = -2zen_{0}\\sinh\\left(\\frac{ze\\psi(x)}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nThis leads to the full Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} = \\frac{2zen_{0}}{\\epsilon}\\sinh\\left(\\frac{ze\\psi(x)}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states to use the linearized framework, which is valid for small potentials, i.e., $|\\frac{ze\\psi}{k_{B}T}| \\ll 1$. In this limit, $\\sinh(u) \\approx u$, so the PB equation linearizes to:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} = \\frac{2z^2e^2n_{0}}{\\epsilon k_{B}T}\\psi(x)\n$$\nThe Debye screening length, $\\lambda_{D}$, is defined as $\\lambda_{D}^{-2} = \\frac{2z^2e^2n_{0}}{\\epsilon k_{B}T}$. Using this definition, the linearized PB equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{D}^2}\\psi(x)\n$$\nThe general solution to this second-order ordinary differential equation is:\n$$\n\\psi(x) = A\\exp(-x/\\lambda_{D}) + B\\exp(x/\\lambda_{D})\n$$\nWe apply two boundary conditions. First, far from the electrode ($x \\to \\infty$), the potential must decay to the bulk potential, which is defined as zero: $\\psi(\\infty) = 0$. This requires $B=0$. Second, at the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP), which we define as $x=0$, the potential is the diffuse layer potential, $\\psi_d$. Thus, $\\psi(0) = \\psi_d$, which gives $A=\\psi_d$. The potential profile in the diffuse layer is therefore:\n$$\n\\psi(x) = \\psi_d \\exp(-x/\\lambda_{D})\n$$\nThe total charge per unit area in the diffuse layer, $\\sigma_d$, must balance the charge on the electrode, $\\sigma_m$, such that $\\sigma_m = -\\sigma_d$. The diffuse layer charge is found by integrating the charge density from the OHP to infinity:\n$$\n\\sigma_d = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\rho(x) \\,dx = -\\epsilon \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} \\,dx = -\\epsilon \\left[\\frac{d\\psi}{dx}\\right]_{0}^{\\infty}\n$$\nThe derivative of the potential is $\\frac{d\\psi}{dx} = -\\frac{\\psi_d}{\\lambda_{D}}\\exp(-x/\\lambda_{D})$. Evaluating this at the limits:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\psi}{dx}\\bigg|_{x\\to\\infty} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{d\\psi}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0} = -\\frac{\\psi_d}{\\lambda_{D}}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the integral for $\\sigma_d$:\n$$\n\\sigma_d = -\\epsilon \\left(0 - \\left(-\\frac{\\psi_d}{\\lambda_D}\\right)\\right) = -\\frac{\\epsilon \\psi_d}{\\lambda_D}\n$$\nThe charge on the metal electrode is $\\sigma_m = -\\sigma_d = \\frac{\\epsilon \\psi_d}{\\lambda_D}$. The differential capacitance of the diffuse layer, $C_D$, is defined as the rate of change of electrode charge with respect to the potential drop across the diffuse layer, $\\psi_d$:\n$$\nC_D = \\frac{d\\sigma_m}{d\\psi_d} = \\frac{d}{d\\psi_d}\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon \\psi_d}{\\lambda_D}\\right) = \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\lambda_D}\n$$\nWithin the linearized approximation, the capacitance is independent of potential. Thus, the diffuse-layer differential capacitance per unit area at PZC is $C_{D}(\\mathrm{PZC}) = \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\lambda_{D}}$.\n\n**Stage 2: Total Interfacial Capacitance**\n\nThe total interfacial capacitance, $C_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, is modeled as the series combination of the compact (Helmholtz) layer capacitance, $C_H$, and the diffuse layer capacitance, $C_D$. The relationship for capacitors in series is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{C_{\\mathrm{tot}}} = \\frac{1}{C_H} + \\frac{1}{C_D(\\mathrm{PZC})}\n$$\nSolving for $C_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ yields:\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\left( \\frac{C_D(\\mathrm{PZC}) + C_H}{C_H C_D(\\mathrm{PZC})} \\right)^{-1} = \\frac{C_H C_D(\\mathrm{PZC})}{C_H + C_D(\\mathrm{PZC})}\n$$\n\n**Stage 3: Calculation of the Dimensionless Ratio $R$**\n\nThe dimensionless ratio $R$ is defined as:\n$$\nR \\equiv \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{C_{D}(\\mathrm{PZC})}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_{\\mathrm{tot}}$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{1}{C_{D}(\\mathrm{PZC})} \\left( \\frac{C_H C_D(\\mathrm{PZC})}{C_H + C_D(\\mathrm{PZC})} \\right) = \\frac{C_H}{C_H + C_D(\\mathrm{PZC})}\n$$\nTo compute the numerical value of $R$, we first convert all given quantities to a coherent system of SI units ($\\mathrm{m}$, $\\mathrm{F}$).\n\nThe compact layer capacitance is given as $C_{H} = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{F/cm^2}$.\n$$\nC_H = 20 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{F} \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m}}\\right)^2 = 20 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{F} \\times \\frac{1}{10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2} = 20 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{F/m^2} = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{F/m^2}\n$$\nThe Debye length is $\\lambda_{D} = 1\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 1 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nThe absolute permittivity of the electrolyte is $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_r \\epsilon_0$:\n$$\n\\epsilon = 78.4 \\times (8.8541878128\\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}) \\approx 6.941683245 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}\n$$\nNow we calculate the diffuse layer capacitance, $C_{D}(\\mathrm{PZC})$:\n$$\nC_{D}(\\mathrm{PZC}) = \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\lambda_{D}} = \\frac{6.941683245 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}}{1 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 0.6941683245\\,\\mathrm{F/m^2}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{C_H}{C_H + C_D(\\mathrm{PZC})} = \\frac{0.2\\,\\mathrm{F/m^2}}{0.2\\,\\mathrm{F/m^2} + 0.6941683245\\,\\mathrm{F/m^2}} = \\frac{0.2}{0.8941683245} \\approx 0.22367139\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested gives $0.2237$.",

The local volume fraction is $\\phi(x) = X_+(x) + X_-(x) = a^3(n_+(x)+n_-(x))$.\nThus, for cations and anions:\n$$ \\bar{\\mu}_+(x) = \\mu_+^{\\ominus} + k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{a^3 n_+(x)}{1 - \\phi(x)}\\right) + e \\psi(x) $$\n$$ \\bar{\\mu}_-(x) = \\mu_-^{\\ominus} + k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{a^3 n_-(x)}{1 - \\phi(x)}\\right) - e \\psi(x) $$\nwhere $\\mu_+^{\\ominus}$ and $\\mu_-^{\\ominus}$ are standard chemical potentials.\n\nWe equate the electrochemical potential at any position $x$ to its value in the bulk reservoir (denoted by $x \\to \\infty$), where $\\psi(\\infty) = 0$, $n_+(\\infty) = n_-(\\infty) = n_{\\infty}$, and the volume fraction is $\\phi_{\\infty} = 2 a^3 n_{\\infty}$.\n\nFor cations ($z_+=+1$):\n$$ \\mu_+^{\\ominus} + k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{a^3 n_+(x)}{1 - \\phi(x)}\\right) + e \\psi(x) = \\mu_+^{\\ominus} + k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{a^3 n_{\\infty}}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty}}\\right) $$\nRearranging gives:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{a^3 n_+(x)}{1 - \\phi(x)}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{a^3 n_{\\infty}}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty}}\\right) - \\frac{e\\psi(x)}{k_B T} $$\nExponentiating both sides yields the implicit relation for $n_+(x)$:\n$$ n_+(\\psi) = \\frac{n_{\\infty}}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty}} (1 - \\phi(\\psi)) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{e\\psi}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nSimilarly for anions ($z_-=-1$):\n$$ n_-(\\psi) = \\frac{n_{\\infty}}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty}} (1 - \\phi(\\psi)) \\exp\\left(\\frac{e\\psi}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nTo find explicit relations, we first solve for $\\phi(\\psi) = a^3(n_+(\\psi) + n_-(\\psi))$:\n$$ \\phi(\\psi) = a^3 \\left[ \\frac{n_{\\infty}}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty}} (1 - \\phi(\\psi)) \\left( \\exp\\left(-\\frac{e\\psi}{k_B T}\\right) + \\exp\\left(\\frac{e\\psi}{k_B T}\\right) \\right) \\right] $$\nUsing the definitions $\\phi_{\\infty} = 2 a^3 n_{\\infty}$ and $\\cosh(y) = (\\exp(y) + \\exp(-y))/2$:\n$$ \\phi(\\psi) = \\frac{2 a^3 n_{\\infty}}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty}} (1 - \\phi(\\psi)) \\cosh\\left(\\frac{e\\psi}{k_B T}\\right) = \\frac{\\phi_{\\infty}}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty}} (1 - \\phi(\\psi)) \\cosh\\left(\\frac{e\\psi}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nSolving for $\\phi(\\psi)$:\n$$ \\phi(\\psi)\\left[1 + \\frac{\\phi_{\\infty}}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty}}\\cosh\\left(\\frac{e\\psi}{k_B T}\\right)\\right] = \\frac{\\phi_{\\infty}}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty}}\\cosh\\left(\\frac{e\\psi}{k_B T}\\right) $$\n$$ \\phi(\\psi) = \\frac{\\phi_{\\infty}\\cosh(e\\psi/k_B T)}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty} + \\phi_{\\infty}\\cosh(e\\psi/k_B T)} $$\nWe can find an expression for the term $(1 - \\phi(\\psi))$:\n$$ 1 - \\phi(\\psi) = 1 - \\frac{\\phi_{\\infty}\\cosh(e\\psi/k_B T)}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty} + \\phi_{\\infty}\\cosh(e\\psi/k_B T)} = \\frac{1 - \\phi_{\\infty}}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty} + \\phi_{\\infty}\\cosh(e\\psi/k_B T)} $$\nSubstituting this back into the expressions for $n_+(\\psi)$ and $n_-(\\psi)$:\n$$ n_+(\\psi) = \\frac{n_{\\infty}}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty}} \\left( \\frac{1 - \\phi_{\\infty}}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty} + \\phi_{\\infty}\\cosh\\left(\\frac{e\\psi}{k_B T}\\right)} \\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{e\\psi}{k_B T}\\right) $$\n$$ n_+(\\psi) = \\frac{n_{\\infty} \\exp(-e\\psi/k_B T)}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty} + \\phi_{\\infty}\\cosh(e\\psi/k_B T)} $$\n$$ n_-(\\psi) = \\frac{n_{\\infty} \\exp(e\\psi/k_B T)}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty} + \\phi_{\\infty}\\cosh(e\\psi/k_B T)} $$\nThese equations can be rewritten using $\\phi_{\\infty} = 2a^3 n_{\\infty}$ and $\\cosh(y)-1 = 2\\sinh^2(y/2)$:\n$$ n_{\\pm}(\\psi) = \\frac{n_{\\infty} \\exp(\\mp e\\psi/k_B T)}{1 + 2a^3 n_{\\infty} (\\cosh(e\\psi/k_B T) - 1)} = \\frac{n_{\\infty} \\exp(\\mp e\\psi/k_B T)}{1 + 4a^3 n_{\\infty} \\sinh^2(e\\psi/2k_B T)} $$\n\n### Upper Bound of Counterion Density\n\nThe electrode is negatively polarized, so $\\psi < 0$. The counterions are the cations (positive charge). We must examine the behavior of $n_+(\\psi)$ as the potential becomes very large and negative, i.e., $\\psi \\to -\\infty$.\nLet $u = e\\psi / k_B T$. As $\\psi \\to -\\infty$, $u \\to -\\infty$.\nIn this limit, $\\exp(-u) \\to \\infty$ and $\\cosh(u) = (\\exp(u) + \\exp(-u))/2 \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\exp(-u)$.\nSubstituting this asymptotic behavior into the expression for $n_+(\\psi)$:\n$$ \\lim_{\\psi \\to -\\infty} n_+(\\psi) = \\lim_{u \\to -\\infty} \\frac{n_{\\infty} \\exp(-u)}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty} + \\phi_{\\infty}\\cosh(u)} $$\n$$ \\approx \\lim_{u \\to -\\infty} \\frac{n_{\\infty} \\exp(-u)}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty} + \\phi_{\\infty} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\exp(-u)} $$\nAs $\\exp(-u) \\to \\infty$, the constant terms in the denominator become negligible compared to the exponential term:\n$$ \\lim_{\\psi \\to -\\infty} n_+(\\psi) \\approx \\lim_{u \\to -\\infty} \\frac{n_{\\infty} \\exp(-u)}{\\frac{\\phi_{\\infty}}{2}\\exp(-u)} = \\frac{2n_{\\infty}}{\\phi_{\\infty}} $$\nUsing the definition $\\phi_{\\infty} = 2 a^3 n_{\\infty}$:\n$$ \\lim_{\\psi \\to -\\infty} n_+(\\psi) = \\frac{2n_{\\infty}}{2 a^3 n_{\\infty}} = \\frac{1}{a^3} $$\nThis demonstrates that steric exclusion imposes a finite upper bound on the counterion concentration, which is the maximum possible packing density of one ion per lattice site. This contrasts sharply with the standard Poisson-Boltzmann model where the concentration would grow exponentially without bound. The condition $\\phi(x) \\to 1$ is met in this limit, as $\\lim_{\\psi \\to -\\infty} \\phi(\\psi) = \\lim_{u \\to -\\infty} \\frac{\\phi_{\\infty}\\cosh(u)}{1-\\phi_{\\infty}+\\phi_{\\infty}\\cosh(u)} = 1$.\n\n### Saturation Potential\n\nSaturation is defined by the condition that the local volume fraction at the surface reaches $\\phi(\\psi_{\\mathrm{sat}}) = \\phi^{\\star} = 0.95$. We use the derived expression for $\\phi(\\psi)$ to solve for the corresponding potential $\\psi_{\\mathrm{sat}}$.\n$$ \\phi^{\\star} = \\frac{\\phi_{\\infty}\\cosh(e\\psi_{\\mathrm{sat}}/k_B T)}{1 - \\phi_{\\infty} + \\phi_{\\infty}\\cosh(e\\psi_{\\mathrm{sat}}/k_B T)} $$\nLet $u_{\\mathrm{sat}} = e\\psi_{\\mathrm{sat}}/k_B T$. We solve for $\\cosh(u_{\\mathrm{sat}})$:\n$$ \\phi^{\\star}(1 - \\phi_{\\infty}) + \\phi^{\\star}\\phi_{\\infty}\\cosh(u_{\\mathrm{sat}}) = \\phi_{\\infty}\\cosh(u_{\\mathrm{sat}}) $$\n$$ \\phi^{\\star}(1 - \\phi_{\\infty}) = \\cosh(u_{\\mathrm{sat}})(\\phi_{\\infty} - \\phi^{\\star}\\phi_{\\infty}) = \\cosh(u_{\\mathrm{sat}})\\phi_{\\infty}(1 - \\phi^{\\star}) $$\n$$ \\cosh(u_{\\mathrm{sat}}) = \\frac{\\phi^{\\star}(1 - \\phi_{\\infty})}{\\phi_{\\infty}(1 - \\phi^{\\star})} $$\nSince the electrode is negatively polarized, $\\psi_{\\mathrm{sat}} < 0$, which implies $u_{\\mathrm{sat}} < 0$. We therefore take the negative solution of the inverse hyperbolic cosine:\n$$ u_{\\mathrm{sat}} = \\frac{e\\psi_{\\mathrm{sat}}}{k_B T} = -\\arccosh\\left(\\frac{\\phi^{\\star}(1 - \\phi_{\\infty})}{\\phi_{\\infty}(1 - \\phi^{\\star})}\\right) $$\nThe magnitude of the surface potential is $|\\psi_{\\mathrm{sat}}| = -\\psi_{\\mathrm{sat}}$.\n$$ |\\psi_{\\mathrm{sat}}| = -\\frac{k_B T}{e} u_{\\mathrm{sat}} = \\frac{k_B T}{e} \\arccosh\\left(\\frac{\\phi^{\\star}(1 - \\phi_{\\infty})}{\\phi_{\\infty}(1 - \\phi^{\\star})}\\right) $$\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\n\nFirst, we calculate the bulk volume fraction $\\phi_{\\infty} = 2 a^3 n_{\\infty}$ using the provided parameters in SI units.\n- $a = 0.5 \\,\\mathrm{nm} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-9} \\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $n_{\\infty} = 1 \\,\\mathrm{mol/L} = 1 \\frac{\\mathrm{mol}}{\\mathrm{L}} \\times \\frac{N_A \\,\\mathrm{ions}}{1 \\,\\mathrm{mol}} \\times \\frac{1 \\,\\mathrm{L}}{10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{m}^3} = 1000 N_A \\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n- $n_{\\infty} = 1000 \\times (6.022\\,140\\,76 \\times 10^{23}) \\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3} = 6.022\\,140\\,76 \\times 10^{26} \\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n$$ \\phi_{\\infty} = 2 \\times (0.5 \\times 10^{-9})^3 \\times (6.022\\,140\\,76 \\times 10^{26}) = 2 \\times (1.25 \\times 10^{-28}) \\times (6.022\\,140\\,76 \\times 10^{26}) $$\n$$ \\phi_{\\infty} = 0.150\\,553\\,519 $$\nNext, we calculate the argument of the $\\arccosh$ function:\n$$ X = \\frac{\\phi^{\\star}(1 - \\phi_{\\infty})}{\\phi_{\\infty}(1 - \\phi^{\\star})} = \\frac{0.95 \\times (1 - 0.150\\,553\\,519)}{0.150\\,553\\,519 \\times (1 - 0.95)} = \\frac{0.95 \\times 0.849\\,446\\,481}{0.150\\,553\\,519 \\times 0.05} $$\n$$ X = \\frac{0.806\\,974\\,157}{0.007\\,527\\,675\\,95} \\approx 107.199\\,929 $$\nNow, we find the value of $\\arccosh(X)$:\n$$ \\arccosh(X) = \\ln(X + \\sqrt{X^2 - 1}) \\approx \\ln(107.199\\,929 + \\sqrt{107.199\\,929^2 - 1}) \\approx 5.367\\,831\\,6 $$\nThe thermal voltage $V_T = k_B T / e$ is:\n$$ V_T = \\frac{(1.380\\,649 \\times 10^{-23} \\,\\mathrm{J/K}) \\times (298 \\,\\mathrm{K})}{1.602\\,176\\,634 \\times 10^{-19} \\,\\mathrm{C}} \\approx 0.025\\,692\\,569 \\,\\mathrm{V} $$\nFinally, we compute the magnitude of the saturation potential:\n$$ |\\psi_{\\mathrm{sat}}| = V_T \\times \\arccosh(X) \\approx (0.025\\,692\\,569) \\times (5.367\\,831\\,6) \\approx 0.137916\\,\\mathrm{V} $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $0.1379 \\,\\mathrm{V}$.",
