The cell's impedance, $Z_{\\text{cell}}$, is the sum of the series resistance (primarily from the electrolyte and separator), $R_{\\text{s,cell}}$, and the impedances of the two electrode-electrolyte interfaces, $Z_{\\text{el,1}}$ and $Z_{\\text{el,2}}$.\n$$\nZ_{\\text{cell}} = R_{\\text{s,cell}} + Z_{\\text{el,1}} + Z_{\\text{el,2}}\n$$\nSince the cell is symmetric with identical electrodes, their impedances are equal: $Z_{\\text{el,1}} = Z_{\\text{el,2}} = Z_{\\text{el}}$. The impedance of a single electrode interface, under conditions where mass transport is negligible, is typically modeled as a parallel combination of the charge-transfer resistance, $R_{\\text{ct,single}}$, and the double-layer capacitance, $C_{\\text{dl}}$.\n$$\nZ_{\\text{el}} = \\left( \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{ct,single}}} + j\\omega C_{\\text{dl}} \\right)^{-1}\n$$\nwhere $j = \\sqrt{-1}$ and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency.\n\nThe Nyquist plot represents the imaginary part of the impedance versus its real part. The intercepts on the real axis correspond to the limits of the impedance at infinite and zero frequency.\n\nAt very high frequency ($\\omega \\rightarrow \\infty$), the capacitor acts as a short circuit ($1/(j\\omega C_{\\text{dl}}) \\rightarrow 0$), so the impedance of each electrode interface, $Z_{\\text{el}}$, tends to zero. The total impedance becomes purely resistive and is the sum of all series resistances.

The expression simplifies to:\n$$\ni \\approx i_0 \\frac{n F \\eta}{R T}\n$$\nThe charge-transfer resistance is defined as the partial derivative of the overpotential with respect to the total current, $I$, at equilibrium ($\\eta=0, I=0$). The total current is the current density multiplied by the electrode area, $A$, so $I = iA$.\n$$\nR_{\\text{ct,single}} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial I} \\right)_{I=0}\n$$\nFrom the linearized equation, we have $\\eta \\approx \\frac{R T}{n F i_0} i = \\frac{R T}{n F i_0} \\frac{I}{A}$.
