Starting from the definition of Gibbs free energy as the maximum non-expansion work deliverable in an isothermal, isobaric process, and the identification of electrical work as the non-expansion work pathway in an electrochemical system, derive the standard electrode potential $E^{\\circ}$ on the Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE) scale corresponding to this half-reaction.

Use the Faraday constant $F=96485\\ \\text{C mol}^{-1}$ and $n=1$. Express the final electrode potential in volts ($V$) and round your numerical answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the standard electrode potential, $E^{\\circ}$, from the standard Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$, for a half-reaction and an analysis of its spontaneity when coupled with a Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE).\n\nThe fundamental relationship between the Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta G$, and the maximum non-expansion work, $w_{\\text{non-exp, max}}$, for a process occurring at constant temperature and pressure is given by:\n$$ \\Delta G = w_{\\text{non-exp, max}} $$\nIn an electrochemical cell, the non-expansion work is the electrical work, $w_{\\text{elec}}$, performed by the system. The electrical work is the product of the total charge transferred and the electric potential difference (voltage) of the cell. For a spontaneous process, the system performs work on the surroundings, so $w_{\\text{elec}}$ is negative by convention. The total charge passed for one mole of a reaction involving the transfer of $n$ moles of electrons is given by the product of $n$ and the Faraday constant, $F$. The potential of the cell is denoted by $E$. Thus, the electrical work is:\n$$ w_{\\text{elec}} = -nFE $$\nEquating the Gibbs free energy change with the electrical work gives the fundamental equation of electrochemistry:\n$$ \\Delta G = -nFE $$\nUnder standard conditions (all species at unit activity or fugacity, at a specified temperature, typically $298\\ \\text{K}$), this relationship is written in terms of standard state quantities:\n$$ \\Delta G^{\\circ} = -nFE^{\\circ} $$\nHere, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ is the standard Gibbs free energy change for the reaction, and $E^{\\circ}$ is the standard cell potential. For a half-reaction, $E^{\\circ}$ represents the standard electrode potential relative to the SHE, for which $E^{\\circ}_{\\text{SHE}}$ is defined as exactly $0\\ \\text{V}$.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n-   Standard Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta G^{\\circ} = -23.1\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$\n-   Number of electrons transferred, $n = 1$\n-   Faraday constant, $F = 96485\\ \\text{C mol}^{-1}$\n\nTo solve for the standard electrode potential, $E^{\\circ}$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$ E^{\\circ} = -\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\circ}}{nF} $$\nBefore substituting the values, we must ensure unit consistency. The Gibbs free energy is given in kilojoules per mole ($\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$), while the Faraday constant uses coulombs ($\\text{C}$), and the potential is desired in volts ($\\text{V}$). Since $1\\ \\text{V} = 1\\ \\text{J C}^{-1}$, we must convert $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ from $\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$ to $\\text{J mol}^{-1}$.\n$$ \\Delta G^{\\circ} = -23.1\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1} \\times \\frac{1000\\ \\text{J}}{1\\ \\text{kJ}} = -23100\\ \\text{J mol}^{-1} $$\nNow we can substitute the numerical values into the expression for $E^{\\circ}$:\n$$ E^{\\circ} = -\\frac{-23100\\ \\text{J mol}^{-1}}{(1) \\cdot (96485\\ \\text{C mol}^{-1})} $$\nThe negative signs cancel, yielding a positive value for $E^{\\circ}$:\n$$ E^{\\circ} = \\frac{23100}{96485}\\ \\frac{\\text{J}}{\\text{C}} $$\n$$ E^{\\circ} \\approx 0.2394206\\ \\text{V} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ E^{\\circ} \\approx 0.2394\\ \\text{V} $$\n\nNext, we must determine the direction of spontaneous electron flow when this half-reaction is coupled with the SHE. The overall cell potential, $E^{\\circ}_{\\text{cell}}$, for a galvanic cell is given by the difference between the standard potential of the cathode (where reduction occurs) and the standard potential of the anode (where oxidation occurs):\n$$ E^{\\circ}_{\\text{cell}} = E^{\\circ}_{\\text{cathode}} - E^{\\circ}_{\\text{anode}} $$\nA reaction is spontaneous in the forward direction if $E^{\\circ}_{\\text{cell}} > 0$. The Standard Hydrogen Electrode has a potential defined as $E^{\\circ}_{\\text{SHE}} = 0\\ \\text{V}$.\n\nWe have calculated the standard potential for our half-reaction (written as a reduction) to be $E^{\\circ}_{\\text{couple}} = +0.2394\\ \\text{V}$. Let's test the configuration where our couple acts as the cathode and SHE acts as the anode.\nIn this case, $E^{\\circ}_{\\text{cathode}} = E^{\\circ}_{\\text{couple}} = +0.2394\\ \\text{V}$ and $E^{\\circ}_{\\text{anode}} = E^{\\circ}_{\\text{SHE}} = 0\\ \\text{V}$.\n$$ E^{\\circ}_{\\text{cell}} = (+0.2394\\ \\text{V}) - (0\\ \\text{V}) = +0.2394\\ \\text{V} $$\nSince $E^{\\circ}_{\\text{cell}} > 0$, this configuration corresponds to a spontaneous process. In this setup, reduction occurs at our electrode (the cathode), and oxidation occurs at the SHE (the anode).\nTherefore, based on the positive sign of its calculated standard electrode potential, the half-reaction proceeds spontaneously as a reduction at its own electrode when coupled with the SHE. This is consistent with the fact that its standard Gibbs free energy of reduction is negative, $\\Delta G^{\\circ} < 0$, which indicates a spontaneous process.",

Assume all activity corrections and transference effects are matched so that reported values can be treated as true potential differences. Express your final answer in volts and round to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the conversion of an electrode potential measured against a Silver/Silver Chloride ($\\text{Ag/AgCl}$) reference electrode to the scale of the Standard Hydrogen Electrode ($\\text{SHE}$). The problem statement provides the necessary framework for this conversion, which relies on the additive property of electrostatic potential differences. This property is applicable under the stated ideal conditions where effects like liquid junction potentials are negligible.\n\nLet $E_{\\text{Fc/Fc}^{+}}$ denote the absolute potential of the ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple. Let $E_{\\text{Ag/AgCl}}$ denote the absolute potential of the $\\text{Ag/AgCl}$ reference electrode. Let $E_{\\text{SHE}}$ denote the absolute potential of the Standard Hydrogen Electrode. Although the potential of the $\\text{SHE}$ is defined as $0$ by convention on its own scale, treating these as distinct absolute potentials is a valid formal approach for relating different reference scales.\n\nThe problem provides two pieces of information:\n\n$1$. The potential of the $\\text{Fc/Fc}^{+}$ couple measured \"versus\" the $\\text{Ag/AgCl}$ electrode is $0.400 \\ \\text{V}$. The problem defines the potential \"$x$ versus $y$\" as the difference $E_{x}-E_{y}$. Applying this definition, we can write the first given as an equation:\n$$E_{\\text{Fc/Fc}^{+}} - E_{\\text{Ag/AgCl}} = 0.400 \\ \\text{V}$$\n\n$2$. The potential of the $\\text{Ag/AgCl}$ electrode measured versus the $\\text{SHE}$ is $0.197 \\ \\text{V}$. This gives us a second equation:\n$$E_{\\text{Ag/AgCl}} - E_{\\text{SHE}} = 0.197 \\ \\text{V}$$\n\nThe objective is to determine the potential of the $\\text{Fc/Fc}^{+}$ couple versus the $\\text{SHE}$. This corresponds to the potential difference $E_{\\text{Fc/Fc}^{+}} - E_{\\text{SHE}}$.\n\nThe problem explicitly provides the physical principle for combining these potentials: $E_{x}-E_{z}=\\left(E_{x}-E_{y}\\right)+\\left(E_{y}-E_{z}\\right)$. This is a direct consequence of potential being a state function, meaning the potential difference between two points is independent of the path taken.\n\nWe can directly apply this principle by making the following substitutions:\n- Let the species of interest, $x$, be the $\\text{Fc/Fc}^{+}$ couple.\n- Let the intermediate reference electrode, $y$, be the $\\text{Ag/AgCl}$ electrode.\n- Let the final reference electrode, $z$, be the $\\text{SHE}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the general formula yields the specific relationship for this problem:\n$$E_{\\text{Fc/Fc}^{+}} - E_{\\text{SHE}} = (E_{\\text{Fc/Fc}^{+}} - E_{\\text{Ag/AgCl}}) + (E_{\\text{Ag/AgCl}} - E_{\\text{SHE}})$$\n\nThis equation demonstrates that the potential of $\\text{Fc/Fc}^{+}$ relative to $\\text{SHE}$ can be found by adding the potential of $\\text{Fc/Fc}^{+}$ relative to $\\text{Ag/AgCl}$ and the potential of $\\text{Ag/AgCl}$ relative to $\\text{SHE}$.\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into this equation:\n$$E_{\\text{Fc/Fc}^{+}} - E_{\\text{SHE}} = 0.400 \\ \\text{V} + 0.197 \\ \\text{V}$$\n\nPerforming the addition:\n$$E_{\\text{Fc/Fc}^{+}} - E_{\\text{SHE}} = 0.597 \\ \\text{V}$$\n\nThe final step is to adhere to the specified formatting for the answer. The problem asks for the answer to be expressed in volts and rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value, $0.597$, contains three significant figures ($5$, $9$, and $7$), thereby satisfying the requirement. It is also consistent with the rules of addition for significant figures, as both input values ($0.400$ and $0.197$) have three decimal places, and thus the sum must be reported to three decimal places.\n\nTherefore, the potential of the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple versus the Standard Hydrogen Electrode is $0.597 \\ \\text{V}$.",
