The Butler-Volmer and Tafel equations are cornerstone models in interfacial electrochemistry and electrode kinetics. All parameters ($i_0$, $\\alpha$, $F$, $R$, $T$, $\\eta$) are standard quantities in this field. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions and a clear objective. The language is precise and objective. There are no contradictions, missing pieces of information, or scientifically unsound premises. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe first step is to express the current densities $i(\\eta)$ and $i_{\\text{T}}(\\eta)$ in terms of the dimensionless overpotential $x = F \\eta/(R T)$.\n\nSubstituting $x$ into the Butler-Volmer equation:\n$$i(x) = i_{0}\\left[\\exp(\\alpha x) - \\exp\\left(-(1-\\alpha) x\\right)\\right]$$\nSubstituting $x$ into the Tafel approximation:\n$$i_{\\text{T}}(x) = i_{0}\\exp(\\alpha x)$$\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the relative error $\\varepsilon(x;\\alpha)$. The numerator of the error expression is the absolute difference between the BV current and the Tafel approximation:\n$$|i(x) - i_{\\text{T}}(x)| = \\left| i_{0}\\left[\\exp(\\alpha x) - \\exp\\left(-(1-\\alpha) x\\right)\\right] - i_{0}\\exp(\\alpha x) \\right|$$\n$$= \\left| -i_{0}\\exp\\left(-(1-\\alpha) x\\right) \\right|$$\nSince the exchange current density $i_0$ is positive, and the exponential function yields a positive value, we have:\n$$|i(x) - i_{\\text{T}}(x)| = i_{0}\\exp\\left(-(1-\\alpha) x\\right)$$\n\nThe denominator of the error expression is the absolute value of the BV current, $|i(x)|$. For $x \\ge 0$ and $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$, we have $\\alpha x \\ge 0$ and $-(1-\\alpha)x \\le 0$. This implies $\\alpha x \\ge -(1-\\alpha)x$. Because the exponential function is strictly increasing, $\\exp(\\alpha x) \\ge \\exp(-(1-\\alpha)x)$. The equality holds only for $x=0$. For $x0$, we have $\\exp(\\alpha x)  \\exp(-(1-\\alpha)x)$. Thus, the term in the brackets of the BV equation is non-negative for $x \\ge 0$. As $i_0  0$, the current $i(x)$ is also non-negative, so $|i(x)| = i(x)$ for $x  0$. At $x=0$, $i(0)=0$, and the error is undefined. We therefore consider the domain $x0$.\n\nThe relative error is:\n$$\\varepsilon(x;\\alpha) = \\frac{i_{0}\\exp\\left(-(1-\\alpha) x\\right)}{i_{0}\\left[\\exp(\\alpha x) - \\exp\\left(-(1-\\alpha) x\\right)\\right]}$$\nThe $i_0$ terms cancel out:\n$$\\varepsilon(x;\\alpha) = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-(1-\\alpha) x\\right)}{\\exp(\\alpha x) - \\exp\\left(-(1-\\alpha) x\\right)}$$\n\nTo simplify this expression, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $\\exp\\left((1-\\alpha) x\\right)$:\n$$\\varepsilon(x;\\alpha) = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-(1-\\alpha) x\\right) \\cdot \\exp\\left((1-\\alpha) x\\right)}{\\left[\\exp(\\alpha x) - \\exp\\left(-(1-\\alpha) x\\right)\\right] \\cdot \\exp\\left((1-\\alpha) x\\right)}$$\nThe numerator becomes $\\exp(0) = 1$. The denominator becomes:\n$$\\exp(\\alpha x)\\exp\\left((1-\\alpha) x\\right) - \\exp\\left(-(1-\\alpha) x\\right)\\exp\\left((1-\\alpha) x\\right)$$\n$$= \\exp\\left(\\alpha x + (1-\\alpha) x\\right) - \\exp(0)$$\n$$= \\exp(x) - 1$$\nThus, the relative error simplifies to an expression that is independent of the symmetry factor $\\alpha$:\n$$\\varepsilon(x) = \\frac{1}{\\exp(x) - 1}$$\n\nThe problem requires finding the minimal $x \\ge 0$ such that $\\varepsilon(x) \\le \\delta$, where $\\delta = 0.05$.\n$$\\frac{1}{\\exp(x) - 1} \\le \\delta$$\nThe function $\\varepsilon(x)$ is a monotonically decreasing function for $x  0$. This means that the inequality will hold for all $x$ greater than or equal to a certain minimum value. This minimum value is found by solving the equality:\n$$\\varepsilon(x) = \\delta$$\n$$\\frac{1}{\\exp(x) - 1} = \\delta$$\nSolving for $x$:\n$$\\exp(x) - 1 = \\frac{1}{\\delta}$$\n$$\\exp(x) = 1 + \\frac{1}{\\delta}$$\n$$x = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\delta}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given value $\\delta = 0.05$:\n$$x = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{0.05}\\right)$$\n$$x = \\ln\\left(1 + 20\\right)$$\n$$x = \\ln(21)$$\n\nTo find the numerical value, we compute the natural logarithm of $21$:\n$$x \\approx 3.0445224377$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $3$, $0$, $4$, $4$. The fifth digit is $5$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$x \\approx 3.045$$\nThis is the minimal dimensionless overpotential $x = F\\eta/(RT)$ required for the anodic Tafel approximation to have a relative error of no more than $5\\%$.",

It presents a standard problem in fundamental electrode kinetics. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for a multi-step derivation starting from the conservation of charge at an electrochemical interface and culminating in an expression for the charge-transfer resistance, $R_{ct}$.\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE)**\n\nAt the electrode-electrolyte interface, the total applied current density, $i_{\\mathrm{app}}(t)$, is partitioned into two components: the capacitive current density, $i_{c}(t)$, which charges the electrical double-layer, and the faradaic current density, $i_{\\mathrm{far}}(\\eta)$, which drives the electrochemical reaction. Conservation of charge dictates that:\n$$i_{\\mathrm{app}}(t) = i_{c}(t) + i_{\\mathrm{far}}(\\eta(t))$$\nThe electrical double-layer is modeled as a capacitor with a constant capacitance per unit area, $C_{dl}$. The charge stored in this capacitor per unit area, $q_{dl}$, is related to the overpotential $\\eta(t)$ by $q_{dl} = C_{dl} \\eta(t)$. The capacitive current density is the rate of change of this charge:\n$$i_{c}(t) = \\frac{dq_{dl}}{dt} = C_{dl} \\frac{d\\eta(t)}{dt}$$\nSubstituting this expression into the charge conservation equation yields the governing ODE for the interface:\n$$i_{\\mathrm{app}}(t) = C_{dl} \\frac{d\\eta(t)}{dt} + i_{\\mathrm{far}}(\\eta(t))$$\n\n**Step 2: Linearize the kinetics and the ODE**\n\nThe faradaic current density is described by the Butler-Volmer equation for a single-step, $n$-electron reaction:\n$$i_{\\mathrm{far}}(\\eta) = i_{0} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{a} n F \\eta}{R T}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha_{c} n F \\eta}{R T}\\right) \\right)$$\nwhere $i_{0}$ is the exchange current density, $\\alpha_{a}$ and $\\alpha_{c}$ are the anodic and cathodic charge-transfer coefficients, respectively, $n$ is the number of electrons transferred, $F$ is the Faraday constant, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe problem states that the applied current density step $\\Delta i$ is small, which implies that the resulting overpotential $\\eta$ is also small (i.e., $|\\eta| \\ll \\frac{RT}{nF}$). We can therefore linearize the Butler-Volmer equation by performing a first-order Taylor series expansion of $i_{\\mathrm{far}}(\\eta)$ around the equilibrium point $\\eta=0$:\n$$i_{\\mathrm{far}}(\\eta) \\approx i_{\\mathrm{far}}(0) + \\left. \\frac{di_{\\mathrm{far}}}{d\\eta} \\right|_{\\eta=0} \\eta$$\nAt equilibrium ($\\eta=0$), the net faradaic current is zero: $i_{\\mathrm{far}}(0) = i_{0} (\\exp(0) - \\exp(0)) = 0$.\nNext, we compute the derivative of $i_{\\mathrm{far}}(\\eta)$ with respect to $\\eta$:\n$$\\frac{di_{\\mathrm{far}}}{d\\eta} = i_{0} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha_{a} n F}{R T} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{a} n F \\eta}{R T}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{\\alpha_{c} n F}{R T}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha_{c} n F \\eta}{R T}\\right) \\right)$$\n$$= \\frac{i_{0} n F}{R T} \\left( \\alpha_{a} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{a} n F \\eta}{R T}\\right) + \\alpha_{c} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha_{c} n F \\eta}{R T}\\right) \\right)$$\nEvaluating this derivative at $\\eta=0$:\n$$\\left. \\frac{di_{\\mathrm{far}}}{d\\eta} \\right|_{\\eta=0} = \\frac{i_{0} n F (\\alpha_{a} + \\alpha_{c})}{R T}$$\nThis derivative represents the conductance of the faradaic reaction at equilibrium.

The system is at equilibrium for $t  0$, so $\\eta(0^{-})=0$. Since the overpotential is the voltage across the double-layer capacitor, it cannot change instantaneously. Thus, the initial condition is $\\eta(0^{+}) = \\eta(0^{-}) = 0$.\nThe ODE can be written in standard form:\n$$\\frac{d\\eta}{dt} + \\frac{1}{R_{ct} C_{dl}} \\eta(t) = \\frac{\\Delta i}{C_{dl}}$$\nThis is a first-order linear non-homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients.

Substituting into the ODE gives $0 + \\frac{B}{R_{ct} C_{dl}} = \\frac{\\Delta i}{C_{dl}}$, which yields $B = \\Delta i R_{ct}$.\nThe general solution is $\\eta(t) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{R_{ct} C_{dl}}\\right) + \\Delta i R_{ct}$.\nApplying the initial condition $\\eta(0)=0$:\n$$0 = A \\exp(0) + \\Delta i R_{ct} \\implies A = -\\Delta i R_{ct}$$\nThe complete solution for the overpotential for $t \\ge 0^{+}$ is:\n$$\\eta(t) = \\Delta i R_{ct} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{R_{ct} C_{dl}}\\right)\\right)$$\nThis solution describes the exponential rise of the overpotential to a steady-state value. The time constant of this process, $\\tau$, is the coefficient in the exponential term:\n$$\\tau = R_{ct} C_{dl}$$\nThe steady-state overpotential, $\\eta_{ss}$, is the value of $\\eta(t)$ as $t \\to \\infty$:\n$$\\eta_{ss} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\eta(t) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\left[ \\Delta i R_{ct} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)\\right) \\right] = \\Delta i R_{ct}$$\n\n**Step 4: Provide the expression for charge-transfer resistance, $R_{ct}$**\n\nThe problem defines the charge-transfer resistance $R_{ct}$ as the ratio of the steady-state overpotential to the small DC current density $\\Delta i$. Using our result from Step 3:\n$$R_{ct} = \\frac{\\eta_{ss}}{\\Delta i} = \\frac{\\Delta i R_{ct}}{\\Delta i} = R_{ct}$$\nThis confirms the consistency of the definition with our derived parameter. The analytical expression for $R_{ct}$ was derived in Step 2 from the linearization of the Butler-Volmer equation:\n$$R_{ct} = \\frac{R T}{i_{0} n F (\\alpha_{a} + \\alpha_{c})}$$\nThis is the final required expression, given in terms of the fundamental kinetic parameters and physical constants.",

It presents a standard electrochemical analysis task based on fundamental principles and realistic data.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Series Ohmic Resistance ($R_{\\mathrm{ohm}}$)**\n\nThe series ohmic resistance, often termed uncompensated resistance ($R_u$ or $R_{\\Omega}$), is a critical parameter in electrochemical measurements. In an Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) experiment, the impedance of the system is measured as a function of the AC frequency ($\\omega$). A Nyquist plot ($Z''$ vs $Z'$) is commonly used for visualization.\n\nAt very high frequencies ($\\omega \\rightarrow \\infty$), all capacitive elements in the equivalent circuit of the electrode-electrolyte interface behave as short circuits. This includes the double-layer capacitance ($C_{dl}$) which becomes a perfect conductor. Consequently, the only impedance remaining at this limit is the purely resistive component that is in series with the interfacial impedance. This resistance is physically attributed to the ionic resistance of the electrolyte between the working electrode and the reference electrode tip, as well as any electronic resistance from the electrode material itself, current collectors, and external wiring.\n\nThe problem states that the high-frequency real-axis intercept of the Nyquist spectrum is $Z'(\\omega \\rightarrow \\infty) = 0.280~\\Omega$. This value directly corresponds to the series ohmic resistance.\n\nTherefore, the series ohmic resistance is:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{ohm}} = 0.280~\\Omega$$\nThe low-frequency intercept, $Z'(\\omega \\rightarrow 0) = 0.830~\\Omega$, represents the sum of the series ohmic resistance and the charge-transfer resistance ($R_{ct}$), i.e., $Z'(\\omega \\rightarrow 0) = R_{\\mathrm{ohm}} + R_{ct}$. While this information is not required for the present tasks, it is consistent with a standard Randles circuit model for an electrode.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Current–Overpotential Relation**\n\nThe net current density ($j$) across an electrode interface is the difference between the anodic ($j_a$) and cathodic ($j_c$) partial current densities. By convention, anodic current is positive and cathodic current is negative.\n$$j = j_a - j_c$$\nThe rates of these partial reactions, and thus the partial current densities, are described by transition state theory, leading to an Arrhenius-type dependence on the activation energy. The activation energy barriers for the anodic ($\\Delta G_a^\\ddagger$) and cathodic ($\\Delta G_c^\\ddagger$) reactions are themselves functions of the electrode potential, $E$.\nThe relationship between the activation barriers and potential is modeled by introducing the kinetic overpotential, $\\eta_k = E - E_{eq}$, and a charge transfer coefficient, $\\alpha$, which represents the fraction of the electrical energy that promotes the cathodic reaction. For a single-step reaction:\n$$\\Delta G_c^\\ddagger = \\Delta G_{c,eq}^\\ddagger + \\alpha nF\\eta_k$$\n$$\\Delta G_a^\\ddagger = \\Delta G_{a,eq}^\\ddagger - (1-\\alpha) nF\\eta_k$$\nwhere $n$ is the number of electrons transferred, $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $E_{eq}$ is the equilibrium potential.\n\nThe partial current densities can then be expressed as:\n$$j_c = j_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha nF\\eta_k}{RT}\\right)$$\n$$j_a = j_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{(1-\\alpha) nF\\eta_k}{RT}\\right)$$\nHere, $j_0$ is the exchange current density, which is the magnitude of the equal and opposite partial currents at equilibrium ($\\eta_k = 0$).\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for the net current density yields the Butler–Volmer equation:\n$$j = j_0 \\left[ \\exp\\left(\\frac{(1-\\alpha) nF\\eta_k}{RT}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha nF\\eta_k}{RT}\\right) \\right]$$\n\nUnder conditions of strong cathodic polarization, the overpotential is large and negative ($\\eta_k \\ll 0$). In this regime, the first exponential term, corresponding to the anodic reaction, becomes negligible compared to the second term.\n$$\\exp\\left(\\frac{(1-\\alpha) nF\\eta_k}{RT}\\right) \\rightarrow 0$$\nThe Butler–Volmer equation simplifies to:\n$$j \\approx -j_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha nF\\eta_k}{RT}\\right)$$\nThe problem provides current densities as positive values for the cathodic branch, which means we are considering the magnitude of the current density, $|j|$. For a net cathodic process, $|j| \\approx j_c$.\n$$|j| \\approx j_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha nF\\eta_k}{RT}\\right)$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives the limiting logarithmic relation, known as the Tafel equation:\n$$\\ln|j| = \\ln(j_0) - \\frac{\\alpha nF\\eta_k}{RT}$$\nRearranging to express the kinetic overpotential as a function of current density:\n$$\\eta_k = \\frac{RT}{\\alpha nF}\\ln(j_0) - \\frac{RT}{\\alpha nF}\\ln|j|$$\nThis equation is of the form $\\eta_k = a + b \\log|j|$, predictin a linear relationship between the kinetic overpotential $\\eta_k$ and the logarithm of the current density magnitude $\\ln|j|$. The slope of this \"Tafel plot\" is:\n$$\\text{Slope} = \\frac{d\\eta_k}{d(\\ln|j|)} = -\\frac{RT}{\\alpha nF}$$\n\n**Part 3: Ohmic Correction and Determination of $\\alpha$**\n\nFirst, the measured overpotential, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{meas}}$, must be corrected for the ohmic potential drop across the series resistance $R_{\\mathrm{ohm}}$. The true kinetic overpotential, $\\eta_k$, is related to the measured overpotential by:\n$$\\eta_k = \\eta_{\\mathrm{meas}} - I R_{\\mathrm{ohm}}$$\nFor a cathodic process, the current $I$ flows into the working electrode and is negative by convention ($I  0$). The problem gives current density $j$ as a positive magnitude. Thus, $I = -|I| = -jA$, where $A$ is the electrode area.\n$$\\eta_k = \\eta_{\\mathrm{meas}} - (-jA)R_{\\mathrm{ohm}} = \\eta_{\\mathrm{meas}} + jAR_{\\mathrm{ohm}}$$\n\nThe electrode area is $A = 4.00~\\mathrm{cm}^2 = 4.00 \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{m}^2$. The ohmic resistance is $R_{\\mathrm{ohm}} = 0.280~\\Omega$. We calculate the corrected kinetic overpotential $\\eta_k$ for each data point:\n\n1.  For $j_1 = 150~\\mathrm{A/m}^2$ and $\\eta_{\\mathrm{meas},1} = -0.1668~\\mathrm{V}$:\n    Ohmic drop: $j_1 A R_{\\mathrm{ohm}} = (150~\\mathrm{A/m^2}) \\times (4.00 \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{m^2}) \\times (0.280~\\Omega) = 0.0168~\\mathrm{V}$.\n    $\\eta_{k,1} = -0.1668~\\mathrm{V} + 0.0168~\\mathrm{V} = -0.1500~\\mathrm{V}$.\n\n2.  For $j_2 = 300~\\mathrm{A/m}^2$ and $\\eta_{\\mathrm{meas},2} = -0.2192~\\mathrm{V}$:\n    Ohmic drop: $j_2 A R_{\\mathrm{ohm}} = (300~\\mathrm{A/m^2}) \\times (4.00 \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{m^2}) \\times (0.280~\\Omega) = 0.0336~\\mathrm{V}$.\n    $\\eta_{k,2} = -0.2192~\\mathrm{V} + 0.0336~\\mathrm{V} = -0.1856~\\mathrm{V}$.\n\n3.  For $j_3 = 900~\\mathrm{A/m}^2$ and $\\eta_{\\mathrm{meas},3} = -0.3428~\\mathrm{V}$:\n    Ohmic drop: $j_3 A R_{\\mathrm{ohm}} = (900~\\mathrm{A/m^2}) \\times (4.00 \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{m^2}) \\times (0.280~\\Omega) = 0.1008~\\mathrm{V}$.\n    $\\eta_{k,3} = -0.3428~\\mathrm{V} + 0.1008~\\mathrm{V} = -0.2420~\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nNow we determine the slope of the Tafel plot, $\\eta_k$ versus $\\ln|j|$. The data points are:\n$(\\ln(150), -0.1500~\\mathrm{V})$, $(\\ln(300), -0.1856~\\mathrm{V})$, $(\\ln(900), -0.2420~\\mathrm{V})$.\nNumerically, these are:\n$(5.0106, -0.1500~\\mathrm{V})$, $(5.7038, -0.1856~\\mathrm{V})$, $(6.8024, -0.2420~\\mathrm{V})$.\n\nTo find the slope, $b$, we can perform a linear regression on these three points. The slope calculation is $b = \\frac{\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}$. A precise calculation yields a slope $b \\approx -0.05135~\\mathrm{V}$. This is consistent with pairwise slope calculations, e.g., between points $2$ and $3$:\n$$b = \\frac{\\eta_{k,3} - \\eta_{k,2}}{\\ln(j_3) - \\ln(j_2)} = \\frac{-0.2420 - (-0.1856)}{\\ln(900) - \\ln(300)} = \\frac{-0.0564}{\\ln(3)} \\approx -0.05134~\\mathrm{V}$$\nWe will use the more robust linear regression value, $b = -0.05135~\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nFrom Part 2, we have the relation for the slope: $b = -\\frac{RT}{\\alpha nF}$. We can now solve for the cathodic transfer coefficient, $\\alpha$:\n$$\\alpha = -\\frac{RT}{nFb}$$\nUsing the given values and physical constants:\n$R = 8.314~\\mathrm{J \\cdot mol^{-1} \\cdot K^{-1}}$\n$T = 298.15~\\mathrm{K}$\n$n = 1$\n$F = 96485~\\mathrm{C \\cdot mol^{-1}}$\n$b = -0.05135~\\mathrm{V} = -0.05135~\\mathrm{J \\cdot C^{-1}}$\n\n$$\\alpha = - \\frac{(8.314~\\mathrm{J \\cdot mol^{-1} \\cdot K^{-1}}) \\times (298.15~\\mathrm{K})}{(1) \\times (96485~\\mathrm{C \\cdot mol^{-1}}) \\times (-0.05135~\\mathrm{J \\cdot C^{-1}})}$$\n$$\\alpha = - \\frac{2478.96~\\mathrm{J \\cdot mol^{-1}}}{-4954.0~\\mathrm{J \\cdot mol^{-1}}} \\approx 0.50039$$\n\nRounding the result to three significant figures gives:\n$$\\alpha \\approx 0.500$$\nThis value indicates that the transition state for the electron transfer reaction is located symmetrically along the reaction coordinate with respect to the electric field.",
