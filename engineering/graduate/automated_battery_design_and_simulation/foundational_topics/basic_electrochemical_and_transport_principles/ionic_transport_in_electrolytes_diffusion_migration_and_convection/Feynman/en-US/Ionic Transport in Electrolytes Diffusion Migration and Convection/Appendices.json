            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the steady-state molar flux of a neutral salt pair in a binary liquid electrolyte under specific conditions. To solve this, we begin with the general Nernst-Planck equation, which describes the flux of an ionic species $i$ in an electrolyte. The total flux $\\vec{J}_i$ is the sum of contributions from diffusion, migration (due to an electric field), and convection (due to bulk fluid motion).\n\nThe Nernst-Planck equation for an ionic species $i$ is:\n$$ \\vec{J}_i = -D_i \\nabla c_i - \\frac{z_i F}{RT} D_i c_i \\nabla \\phi + c_i \\vec{v} $$\nwhere $D_i$ is the diffusivity of species $i$, $c_i$ is its molar concentration, $z_i$ is its charge number, $F$ is the Faraday constant, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $\\phi$ is the electrostatic potential, and $\\vec{v}$ is the mass-averaged fluid velocity. The problem specifies a one-dimensional system along the $x$-axis, from $x=0$ to $x=L$.\n\nWe apply the conditions stated in the problem:\n1.  **No convection**: The mass-averaged fluid velocity is zero, so $\\vec{v} = 0$. The convective term $c_i \\vec{v}$ vanishes.\n2.  **Isothermal system**: The temperature $T$ is constant.\n3.  **Ideal electrolyte**: Activity coefficients are unity, so concentration can be used directly.\n4.  **One-dimensional slab**: The gradient operator $\\nabla$ becomes the derivative $\\frac{d}{dx}$.\n\nThe Nernst-Planck equations for the cation (subscript $+$) and anion (subscript $-$) simplify to:\n$$ J_+(x) = -D_+ \\frac{dc_+(x)}{dx} - \\frac{z_+ F}{RT} D_+ c_+(x) \\frac{d\\phi(x)}{dx} $$\n$$ J_-(x) = -D_- \\frac{dc_-(x)}{dx} - \\frac{z_- F}{RT} D_- c_-(x) \\frac{d\\phi(x)}{dx} $$\n\nThe electrolyte is a binary salt, which we assume to be of the form $A_{\\nu_+} B_{\\nu_-}$. For simplicity and without loss of generality for the given conditions, let's consider a symmetric $1:1$ salt (e.g., $\\text{LiCl}$), so $z_+ = 1$ and $z_- = -1$. The principle of electroneutrality in the electrolyte bulk requires that the local concentrations of positive and negative charges balance. Therefore, $z_+ c_+ + z_- c_- = 0$, which for a $1:1$ salt implies $c_+ = c_-$. We denote this common concentration as the salt concentration, $c(x)$. Consequently, their concentration gradients are also equal: $\\frac{dc_+}{dx} = \\frac{dc_-}{dx} = \\frac{dc}{dx}$.\n\nThe problem states there is no externally applied current. The total electric current density, $i$, is related to the ionic fluxes by $i = F \\sum_i z_i J_i$. For our binary system, this is:\n$$ i = F(z_+ J_+ + z_- J_-) = F(J_+ - J_-) = 0 $$\nThis implies that the molar fluxes of the cation and anion must be equal at every point in the slab: $J_+(x) = J_-(x)$.\n\nThe problem also states that the cation and anion have identical diffusivities, so $D_+ = D_-$. We denote this common ionic diffusivity by $D_{ion}$. Under these symmetric conditions, let's examine the fluxes:\n$$ J_+ = -D_{ion} \\frac{dc}{dx} - \\frac{z_+ F}{RT} D_{ion} c \\frac{d\\phi}{dx} $$\n$$ J_- = -D_{ion} \\frac{dc}{dx} - \\frac{z_- F}{RT} D_{ion} c \\frac{d\\phi}{dx} $$\nSetting $J_+ = J_-$ and substituting $z_+ = -z_-$, we obtain:\n$$ -D_{ion} \\frac{dc}{dx} - \\frac{z_+ F}{RT} D_{ion} c \\frac{d\\phi}{dx} = -D_{ion} \\frac{dc}{dx} + \\frac{z_+ F}{RT} D_{ion} c \\frac{d\\phi}{dx} $$\n$$ -2 \\frac{z_+ F}{RT} D_{ion} c \\frac{d\\phi}{dx} = 0 $$\nSince $z_+$, $F$, $R$, $T$, $D_{ion}$, and $c$ are all non-zero, this equation requires that the electric field must be zero everywhere within the slab:\n$$ \\frac{d\\phi}{dx} = 0 $$\nThis confirms the problem's statement that the diffusion potential vanishes under these symmetry conditions. With a zero electric field, the migration term in the Nernst-Planck equation disappears. The flux is purely diffusive.\n\nThe flux of each ion is now given by:\n$$ J_+ = J_- = -D_{ion} \\frac{dc}{dx} $$\nThe flux of the neutral salt pair, $J$, is equal to the flux of the individual ions, $J = J_+ = J_-$. The problem provides the \"ambipolar salt diffusivity\", $D$. In the specific case where ionic diffusivities are equal ($D_+ = D_- = D_{ion}$), the ambipolar diffusivity is simply the ionic diffusivity, so $D = D_{ion}$. Thus, the governing equation for the salt flux is:\n$$ J = -D \\frac{dc}{dx} $$\n\nThe system is at steady state, which means that all time derivatives are zero ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0$). The foundational statement of species conservation (the continuity equation) is $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\vec{J} = 0$. In one dimension and at steady state, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{dJ}{dx} = 0 $$\nThis implies that the molar flux $J$ is constant throughout the slab, from $x=0$ to $x=L$.\n\nSince both $J$ and $D$ are constants, we can integrate the flux equation with respect to position across the slab:\n$$ \\int_{c(0)}^{c(L)} dc = \\int_{0}^{L} -\\frac{J}{D} dx $$\nUsing the given boundary conditions, $c(0) = c_0$ and $c(L) = c_L$:\n$$ c(L) - c(0) = -\\frac{J}{D} (L - 0) $$\n$$ c_L - c_0 = -\\frac{J L}{D} $$\nWe can now solve for the steady-state molar flux, $J$:\n$$ J = -D \\frac{c_L - c_0}{L} = D \\frac{c_0 - c_L}{L} $$\nThis expression is Fick's first law of diffusion for a steady-state process.\n\nNow we substitute the provided numerical values:\n-   Slab thickness: $L = 1.00 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n-   Ambipolar salt diffusivity: $D = 1.80 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}\\ s^{-1}}$.\n-   Left boundary concentration: $c_{0} = 1.20 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-3}}$.\n-   Right boundary concentration: $c_{L} = 9.00 \\times 10^{2}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-3}}$.\n\nThe concentration difference is:\n$$ c_0 - c_L = (1.20 \\times 10^{3}) - (9.00 \\times 10^{2}) = 1200 - 900 = 300\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-3}} $$\nThis can be written as $3.00 \\times 10^2 \\ \\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-3}}$.\n\nSubstituting the values into the expression for the flux $J$:\n$$ J = (1.80 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}\\ s^{-1}}) \\times \\frac{3.00 \\times 10^{2}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-3}}}{1.00 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}} $$\nFirst, we calculate the term $\\frac{c_0 - c_L}{L}$:\n$$ \\frac{3.00 \\times 10^{2}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-3}}}{1.00 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}} = 3.00 \\times 10^{(2 - (-4))}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-4}} = 3.00 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-4}} $$\nNow, we multiply by the diffusivity $D$:\n$$ J = (1.80 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}\\ s^{-1}}) \\times (3.00 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-4}}) $$\n$$ J = (1.80 \\times 3.00) \\times 10^{(-10 + 6)}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-2}\\ s^{-1}} $$\n$$ J = 5.40 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-2}\\ s^{-1}} $$\nThe problem requires rounding the answer to three significant figures.

The analysis is grounded in the physical model of thermally activated transport.\n\nFirst, we establish the theoretical relationship between the diffusion coefficient, $D$, and temperature, $T$. The problem statement alludes to a mechanistic picture of thermally activated 'cage-escape' events, which can be described by an Arrhenius-type relationship. In this model, the diffusion coefficient is proportional to the frequency of successful ionic jumps, which is governed by the Boltzmann probability of surmounting an energy barrier $E_a$.

This barrier arises from the need for the ion to break free from its coordinating solvent shell (the \"solvent cage\") and for the surrounding solvent molecules to rearrange locally to create a vacant site for the ion to jump into. A higher $E_a$ indicates stronger ion-solvent interactions or a more rigid solvent structure, both of which hinder ionic mobility.\n\nFor automated battery design and simulation, this parameter is critical. Ionic transport in comprehensive battery models is described by the Nernst-Planck equation, where the diffusion coefficient $D$ is a key input parameter that governs the concentration gradients that build up during operation. The activation energy $E_a$ provides a physically meaningful and computationally efficient way to model the strong temperature dependence of $D$. In automated materials discovery, $E_a$ serves as a crucial metric for screening and ranking new electrolyte formulations; electrolytes with lower activation energies are generally preferred as they promise better performance, particularly at low temperatures where ionic transport can become a limiting factor. In simulation, the $E_a$-based Arrhenius model allows for accurate prediction of battery performance (e.g., power capability, charging time) across a range of operating temperatures, which is essential for designing effective thermal management systems and ensuring safety.",
