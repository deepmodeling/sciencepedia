            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on fundamental principles of physics and electrical engineering, provides all necessary information for a unique solution, and is free of ambiguity. The solution proceeds in three parts as requested.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of SEI Resistance\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the additional series resistance, $R_{\\text{SEI}}$, contributed by the Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) layer. We are given the constitutive relation for an ionic conductor, the definition of current, and the definition of resistance.\n\nThe problem states that current conduction through the SEI is quasi-steady, one-dimensional, and uniform. The constitutive relation is given as $\\mathbf{J} = k \\mathbf{E}$, where $\\mathbf{J}$ is the current density, $k$ is the ionic conductivity, and $\\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field. For the SEI layer, this becomes $\\mathbf{J} = k_{\\text{SEI}} \\mathbf{E}$.\n\nUnder the assumption of one-dimensional, uniform conduction normal to the SEI surface, the vector quantities $\\mathbf{J}$ and $\\mathbf{E}$ can be treated as scalars, $J$ and $E$, representing their magnitudes. Thus, $J = k_{\\text{SEI}} E$.\n\nFor a uniform material of thickness $L_{\\text{SEI}}$ under steady conduction, the electric field $E$ is constant throughout the material and is related to the potential difference $\\Delta V_{\\text{SEI}}$ across it by:\n$$E = \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\text{SEI}}}{L_{\\text{SEI}}}$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $E$ into the constitutive relation yields:\n$$J = k_{\\text{SEI}} \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\text{SEI}}}{L_{\\text{SEI}}}$$\n\nThe total current $I$ flowing through the SEI is defined as the integral of the current density over the active area $A$: $I = \\int_A \\mathbf{J} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A}$. Since the current density $J$ is uniform and normal to the area $A$, this integral simplifies to $I = J A$. We can express the current density as $J = I/A$.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $J$ back into our working equation gives:\n$$\\frac{I}{A} = k_{\\text{SEI}} \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\text{SEI}}}{L_{\\text{SEI}}}$$\n\nThe problem defines resistance as $R = \\Delta V / I$. We seek the resistance of the SEI, $R_{\\text{SEI}}$, which is the ratio of the potential drop across the SEI, $\\Delta V_{\\text{SEI}}$, to the current flowing through it, $I$. We rearrange the equation above to solve for the ratio $\\Delta V_{\\text{SEI}}/I$:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta V_{\\text{SEI}}}{I} = \\frac{L_{\\text{SEI}}}{k_{\\text{SEI}} A}$$\n\nTherefore, the expression for the additional series resistance contributed by the SEI is:\n$$R_{\\text{SEI}} = \\frac{L_{\\text{SEI}}}{k_{\\text{SEI}} A}$$\n\n### Part 2: Derivation of Maximum Power Transfer\n\nThe cell is modeled as a Thevenin equivalent circuit comprising an ideal voltage source $V_{\\text{oc}}$ in series with a total internal resistance, $R_{\\text{int}}$. This total resistance is the sum of the initial internal resistance $R_0$ and the resistance of the newly formed SEI layer $R_{\\text{SEI}}$:\n$$R_{\\text{int}} = R_0 + R_{\\text{SEI}}$$\n\nThis source drives an external resistive load with resistance $R_L$. According to Kirchhoff's voltage law applied to this simple series circuit, the sum of voltage drops equals the source voltage:\n$$V_{\\text{oc}} = I R_{\\text{int}} + I R_L$$\n\nThe current $I$ flowing through the circuit is therefore:\n$$I = \\frac{V_{\\text{oc}}}{R_{\\text{int}} + R_L}$$\n\nThe power $P_L$ delivered to the external load is given by $P_L = I^2 R_L$. Substituting the expression for $I$ gives the power as a function of the load resistance $R_L$:\n$$P_L(R_L) = \\left( \\frac{V_{\\text{oc}}}{R_{\\text{int}} + R_L} \\right)^2 R_L = \\frac{V_{\\text{oc}}^2 R_L}{(R_{\\text{int}} + R_L)^2}$$\n\nTo find the value of $R_L$ that maximizes this power, we must find the derivative of $P_L$ with respect to $R_L$ and set it to zero. Using the quotient rule for differentiation, $[f/g]' = (f'g - fg')/g^2$, with $f(R_L) = V_{\\text{oc}}^2 R_L$ and $g(R_L) = (R_{\\text{int}} + R_L)^2$:\n$$\\frac{d P_L}{d R_L} = \\frac{V_{\\text{oc}}^2 (R_{\\text{int}} + R_L)^2 - V_{\\text{oc}}^2 R_L [2(R_{\\text{int}} + R_L)]}{(R_{\\text{int}} + R_L)^4}$$\n\nSetting the derivative to zero for a maximum (we can ignore the denominator as long as it is non-zero, which it is for any physical resistor):\n$$V_{\\text{oc}}^2 (R_{\\text{int}} + R_L)^2 - 2 V_{\\text{oc}}^2 R_L (R_{\\text{int}} + R_L) = 0$$\nFactoring out the common terms $V_{\\text{oc}}^2(R_{\\text{int}} + R_L)$:\n$$V_{\\text{oc}}^2 (R_{\\text{int}} + R_L) [ (R_{\\text{int}} + R_L) - 2 R_L ] = 0$$\nSince $V_{\\text{oc}} > 0$ and $R_{\\text{int}} + R_L > 0$, the term in the square brackets must be zero:\n$$R_{\\text{int}} + R_L - 2 R_L = 0$$\n$$R_{\\text{int}} - R_L = 0 \\implies R_L = R_{\\text{int}}$$\nThis is the well-known maximum power transfer theorem: maximal power is delivered to a load when the load resistance equals the source's internal resistance.\n\nThe corresponding maximum deliverable power, $P_{\\text{max}}$, is found by substituting $R_L = R_{\\text{int}}$ back into the power expression:\n$$P_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{oc}}^2 R_{\\text{int}}}{(R_{\\text{int}} + R_{\\text{int}})^2} = \\frac{V_{\\text{oc}}^2 R_{\\text{int}}}{(2 R_{\\text{int}})^2} = \\frac{V_{\\text{oc}}^2 R_{\\text{int}}}{4 R_{\\text{int}}^2}$$\nThe maximum deliverable power is thus:\n$$P_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{oc}}^2}{4 R_{\\text{int}}}$$\nwhere $R_{\\text{int}}$ is the total internal series resistance of the cell.\n\n### Part 3: Numerical Computation\n\nWe are asked to compute the numerical value of the maximum deliverable power, $P_{\\text{max}}$, using the provided parameters. First, we calculate the total internal resistance $R_{\\text{int}} = R_0 + R_{\\text{SEI}}$.\n\nThe SEI resistance, $R_{\\text{SEI}}$, is calculated using the formula derived in Part 1. We must ensure all units are consistent (SI units).\nGiven parameters:\n$L_{\\text{SEI}} = 40\\,\\text{nm} = 40 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m} = 4.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\text{m}$\n$k_{\\text{SEI}} = 4.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{S}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$\n$A = 0.10\\,\\text{m}^{2}$\n\n$$R_{\\text{SEI}} = \\frac{L_{\\text{SEI}}}{k_{\\text{SEI}} A} = \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\text{m}}{(4.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{S}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}) (0.10\\,\\text{m}^{2})}$$\n$$R_{\\text{SEI}} = \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{-8}}{4.0 \\times 10^{-5}}\\,\\Omega = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\Omega$$\n\nThe initial internal resistance is given as $R_0 = 4.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\Omega$. The total internal resistance is:\n$$R_{\\text{int}} = R_0 + R_{\\text{SEI}} = (4.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\Omega) + (1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\Omega) = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\Omega$$\n\nNow we can compute the maximum deliverable power using the formula from Part 2 and the given open-circuit voltage $V_{\\text{oc}} = 3.6\\,\\text{V}$:\n$$P_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{oc}}^2}{4 R_{\\text{int}}} = \\frac{(3.6\\,\\text{V})^2}{4 \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\Omega)}$$\n$$P_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{12.96\\,\\text{V}^2}{20.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\Omega} = \\frac{12.96}{0.020}\\,\\text{W}$$\n$$P_{\\text{max}} = 648\\,\\text{W}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

The problem is formalizable and directly relevant to the stated topic.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A detailed solution is provided below.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe effective ionic conductivity, $k_{eff}$, in a porous medium is related to the intrinsic ionic conductivity of the electrolyte, $k$, by the formation factor, $F$. The formation factor accounts for the increased path length (tortuosity) and reduced cross-sectional area (constrictivity) of the pore network.\n$$k_{eff} = \\frac{k}{F}$$\nThe problem provides a specific scaling relationship for disordered media that connects the permeability, $K$, the critical throat size, $r_c$, and the formation factor, $F$, via a dimensionless microstructural prefactor, $c$.\n$$K = c \\frac{r_c^2}{F}$$\nWe can rearrange this scaling law to solve for the formation factor:\n$$F = c \\frac{r_c^2}{K}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $F$ into the equation for $k_{eff}$ yields:\n$$k_{eff} = \\frac{k}{c \\frac{r_c^2}{K}} = \\frac{kK}{c \\cdot r_c^2}$$\nThe critical throat size, $r_c$, corresponds to the percolation threshold observed in Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry (MIP). This radius is related to the breakthrough capillary pressure, $P_c$, by the Washburn equation:\n$$P_c = -\\frac{2 \\gamma \\cos(\\theta)}{r_c}$$\nHere, $\\gamma$ is the surface tension of mercury and $\\theta$ is the contact angle. The negative sign is a consequence of $\\theta > 90^\\circ$ for a non-wetting fluid like mercury, ensuring that $P_c$ is a positive pressure. Solving for $r_c$:\n$$r_c = -\\frac{2 \\gamma \\cos(\\theta)}{P_c}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $r_c$ into our equation for $k_{eff}$:\n$$k_{eff} = \\frac{kK}{c \\left( -\\frac{2 \\gamma \\cos(\\theta)}{P_c} \\right)^2} = \\frac{kK P_c^2}{c (2 \\gamma \\cos(\\theta))^2}$$\nThis expression relates the effective conductivity to the known experimental parameters. The problem provides ranges for both the critical pressure, $P_c \\in [P_{c,\\min}, P_{c,\\max}]$, and the prefactor, $c \\in [c_{\\min}, c_{\\max}]$, where $c_{\\min} = 1/250$ and $c_{\\max} = 1/200$.\n\nTo find the lower and upper bounds for $k_{eff}$, we examine the dependencies. $k_{eff}$ is proportional to $P_c^2$ and inversely proportional to $c$.\nThe lower bound, $k_{eff, \\min}$, is obtained by using the minimum value of $P_c$ and the maximum value of $c$:\n$$k_{eff, \\min} = \\frac{kK P_{c, \\min}^2}{c_{\\max} (2 \\gamma \\cos(\\theta))^2}$$\nThe upper bound, $k_{eff, \\max}$, is obtained by using the maximum value of $P_c$ and the minimum value of $c$:\n$$k_{eff, \\max} = \\frac{kK P_{c, \\max}^2}{c_{\\min} (2 \\gamma \\cos(\\theta))^2}$$\nThe problem asks for the geometric mean of this bounded range, which we denote as $k_{eff, geo}$:\n$$k_{eff, geo} = \\sqrt{k_{eff, \\min} \\cdot k_{eff, \\max}} = \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{kK P_{c, \\min}^2}{c_{\\max} (2 \\gamma \\cos(\\theta))^2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{kK P_{c, \\max}^2}{c_{\\min} (2 \\gamma \\cos(\\theta))^2} \\right)}$$\nSimplifying this expression:\n$$k_{eff, geo} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(kK)^2 (P_{c, \\min} P_{c, \\max})^2}{c_{\\min} c_{\\max} \\left((2 \\gamma \\cos(\\theta))^2\\right)^2}} = \\frac{kK P_{c, \\min} P_{c, \\max}}{\\sqrt{c_{\\min} c_{\\max}} (2 \\gamma \\cos(\\theta))^2}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n-   $k = 1.2 \\,\\mathrm{S/m}$\n-   $K = 2.0 \\times 10^{-19} \\,\\mathrm{m}^2$\n-   $P_{c,\\min} = 30 \\times 10^6 \\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n-   $P_{c,\\max} = 60 \\times 10^6 \\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n-   $\\gamma = 0.485 \\,\\mathrm{N/m}$\n-   $\\theta = 140^\\circ$\n-   $c_{\\min} = 1/250$\n-   $c_{\\max} = 1/200$\n\nFirst, let's compute the term in the denominator involving the MIP parameters:\n$$(2 \\gamma \\cos(\\theta))^2 = (2 \\times 0.485 \\,\\mathrm{N/m} \\times \\cos(140^\\circ))^2 \\approx (0.97 \\times (-0.766044))^2 \\approx (-0.743063)^2 \\,\\mathrm{Pa}^2\\mathrm{m}^2 \\approx 0.552142 \\,\\mathrm{Pa}^2\\mathrm{m}^2$$\nNext, let's compute the geometric mean of the prefactor $c$:\n$$\\sqrt{c_{\\min} c_{\\max}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{250} \\times \\frac{1}{200}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{50000}} = \\frac{1}{100\\sqrt{5}} \\approx 0.0044721$$\nNow, substitute these intermediate results into the expression for $k_{eff, geo}$:\n$$k_{eff, geo} = \\frac{(1.2 \\,\\mathrm{S/m}) \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{-19} \\,\\mathrm{m}^2) \\times (30 \\times 10^6 \\,\\mathrm{Pa}) \\times (60 \\times 10^6 \\,\\mathrm{Pa})}{(0.0044721) \\times (0.552142 \\,\\mathrm{Pa}^2\\mathrm{m}^2)}$$\n$$k_{eff, geo} = \\frac{1.2 \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{-19}) \\times (1800 \\times 10^{12})}{0.00246914} \\,\\mathrm{S/m}$$\n$$k_{eff, geo} = \\frac{4.32 \\times 10^{-4}}{0.00246914} \\,\\mathrm{S/m} \\approx 0.174956 \\,\\mathrm{S/m}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested gives $0.1750 \\,\\mathrm{S/m}$.\n\nNote that the porosity value, $\\epsilon = 0.33$, was not used in the derivation.

Consider a polymeric separator modeled as a thin elastic plate that bridges individual pores, with a pore size distribution specified as a set of pore radii.

The risk of dendrite penetration is evaluated by comparing the maximum bending-induced surface stress around each pore under the applied stack pressure to a critical stress derived from Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM), with the characteristic flaw size taken to scale with the pore radius. Starting from classical Kirchhoff–Love thin plate theory for a clamped circular plate under uniform transverse pressure and from LEFM for a brittle crack of characteristic size related to the pore radius, derive an expression for the bending stress at the plate surface over the pore and an expression for the critical stress for crack initiation at the pore rim.

The ratio of these two quantities defines a vulnerability metric, which is used to assess the risk of mechanical failure and to determine a minimum safe separator thickness.\n\nThe following assumptions are made to formalize the model as per the problem statement:\n1.  Each pore in the separator is modeled as a clamped circular elastic plate of radius $r_i$ and thickness $t$. The plate is subjected to a uniform transverse pressure $P$, which is the stack pressure.\n2.  The maximum bending stress is calculated using Kirchhoff-Love thin plate theory, which is valid for small deflections (deflection is much smaller than the plate thickness). While this assumption may be violated under extreme conditions (as may occur in test case C), the theory is used as mandated by the problem.\n3.  The critical stress for fracture is determined using Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM). The separator is assumed to be under plane stress conditions, which is appropriate for a thin film.\n4.  The problem states that the characteristic flaw size, $a$, \"is taken to scale with the pore radius, $r_i$\". For a conservative and well-defined model, we assume the flaw size is equal to the pore radius, $a = r_i$. This represents a crack-like defect at the pore rim, of a size comparable to the pore itself.\n5.  In the LEFM critical stress formula, the dimensionless geometry factor, $Y$, which depends on crack shape and location, is taken to be unity ($Y=1$). This is a common simplification for an initial estimate of fracture behavior.\n\n**1. Derivation of Bending-Induced Stress ($\\sigma_{\\text{bend}}$)**\n\nAccording to Kirchhoff-Love plate theory, a circular plate of radius $r$ and thickness $t$, clamped at its edges and subjected to a uniform pressure $P$, experiences its maximum stress at the surface ($z = \\pm t/2$) of the clamped edge ($\\rho=r$). The stress components at the edge are the radial stress, $\\sigma_r$, and the tangential (hoop) stress, $\\sigma_\\theta$. The maximum principal stress at this location is given by:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{bend, max}} = \\frac{3}{4} \\frac{P r^2}{t^2}\n$$\nThis formula is derived from the plate's bending moments and is notably independent of the material's Poisson's ratio. Applying this to a single pore of radius $r_i$, the maximum bending-induced stress at its rim is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{bend}}(r_i) = \\frac{3}{4} \\frac{P r_i^2}{t^2}\n$$\n\n**2. Derivation of Critical Stress for Fracture ($\\sigma_{\\text{crit}}$)**\n\nLEFM provides the criterion for the propagation of a crack. For a mode I (opening mode) crack, fracture occurs when the stress intensity factor $K_I$ reaches the material's fracture toughness, $K_{Ic}$. The critical applied stress $\\sigma_{\\text{crit}}$ that causes this is given by:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{crit}} = \\frac{K_{Ic}}{Y\\sqrt{\\pi a}}\n$$\nwhere $a$ is the characteristic flaw (crack) size and $Y$ is the geometry factor. As stated in the assumptions, we take $Y=1$ and $a=r_i$.\n\nThe fracture toughness $K_{Ic}$ is related to the fracture energy $G_c$ and Young's modulus $E$. For the specified plane stress condition, this relationship is:\n$$\nK_{Ic} = \\sqrt{E G_c}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the critical stress equation, we obtain the expression for the critical stress for a flaw at a pore of radius $r_i$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{crit}}(r_i) = \\frac{\\sqrt{E G_c}}{\\sqrt{\\pi r_i}}\n$$\n\n**3. Vulnerability Metric and Risk Assessment**\n\nThe vulnerability metric $V_i$ for a pore of radius $r_i$ is the ratio of the applied bending stress to the critical stress:\n$$\nV_i = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{bend}}(r_i)}{\\sigma_{\\text{crit}}(r_i)} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{4} \\frac{P r_i^2}{t^2}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{E G_c}}{\\sqrt{\\pi r_i}}}\n$$\nSimplifying this expression yields:\n$$\nV_i = \\frac{3\\sqrt{\\pi}}{4} \\frac{P}{\\sqrt{E G_c}} \\frac{r_i^{2.5}}{t^2}\n$$\nThe problem states that a risk of breakthrough exists if the maximum vulnerability across all pores is greater than or equal to $1$. Since $V_i$ is a monotonically increasing function of $r_i$ (proportional to $r_i^{2.5}$), the maximum vulnerability will occur at the largest pore radius, $r_{\\max} = \\max_i(r_i)$.\n$$\nV_{\\max} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{\\pi}}{4} \\frac{P}{\\sqrt{E G_c}} \\frac{r_{\\max}^{2.5}}{t^2}\n$$\nThe risk condition is therefore:\n$$\n\\text{Risk} = (V_{\\max} \\ge 1)\n$$\n\n**4. Derivation of Minimum Separator Thickness ($t_{\\min}$)**\n\nTo guarantee no breakthrough, the vulnerability must be strictly less than $1$ for all pores, which is equivalent to ensuring $V_{\\max} < 1$. This provides the \"explicit inequality\" requested:\n$$\n\\frac{3\\sqrt{\\pi}}{4} \\frac{P}{\\sqrt{E G_c}} \\frac{r_{\\max}^{2.5}}{t^2} < 1\n$$\nTo find the minimum thickness $t_{\\min}$ that satisfies this condition, we can set the vulnerability to the limit of $1$ and solve for $t$:\n$$\n1 = \\frac{3\\sqrt{\\pi}}{4} \\frac{P}{\\sqrt{E G_c}} \\frac{r_{\\max}^{2.5}}{t_{\\min}^2}\n$$\nRearranging to solve for $t_{\\min}$ gives the closed-form expression:\n$$\nt_{\\min}^2 = \\frac{3\\sqrt{\\pi}}{4} \\frac{P}{\\sqrt{E G_c}} r_{\\max}^{2.5}\n$$\n$$\nt_{\\min} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3\\sqrt{\\pi}}{4} \\frac{P r_{\\max}^{2.5}}{\\sqrt{E G_c}}}\n$$\nThis expression allows for the calculation of the minimum required separator thickness to prevent mechanical failure for a given set of material properties, stack pressure, and pore size distribution. Note for Case C, the calculated bending stress, $3.375\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, exceeds the material's Young's modulus, $0.5\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, indicating that the small deflection assumption of the mandated theory is violated. The material would exhibit large, non-linear deformation. However, the calculation proceeds per the problem's strict adherence to the specified linear elastic model. The resulting high vulnerability correctly identifies this as a high-risk scenario, even if the quantitative value is a model-based extrapolation.",
