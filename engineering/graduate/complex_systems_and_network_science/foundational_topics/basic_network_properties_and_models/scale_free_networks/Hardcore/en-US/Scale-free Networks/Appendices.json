            "problem": "In the study of network theory, the growth of many real-world networks, such as citation networks or the World Wide Web, can be modeled by a process of preferential attachment. Consider a small, isolated citation network consisting of five foundational papers. The importance of each paper is quantified by its degree, which represents the number of connections it has within this network. The degrees of these five papers are $4, 3, 2, 2,$ and $1$.\n\nA new research paper is being written and will cite exactly one of these five foundational papers. The model for this citation process states that the probability of the new paper connecting to any given foundational paper is directly proportional to the degree of that foundational paper.\n\nCalculate the probability that the new paper will cite the most influential paper in the existing network, which is the one with a degree of 4. Express your answer as a simplified fraction.",
            "solution": "Under preferential attachment, the probability that the new paper cites a given foundational paper is proportional to that paper's degree. Let the degrees be $k_{1}=4$, $k_{2}=3$, $k_{3}=2$, $k_{4}=2$, and $k_{5}=1$. The total degree is the sum\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{5} k_{i} = 4+3+2+2+1 = 12.\n$$\nThe probability of citing the paper with degree $4$ is\n$$\nP = \\frac{k_{1}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{5} k_{i}} = \\frac{4}{12} = \\frac{1}{3}.\n$$\nThus, the desired probability is the simplified fraction $\\frac{1}{3}$.",

            "introduction": "A key feature of scale-free networks is their vulnerability to targeted attacks on high-centrality nodes, a property with profound implications for everything from infrastructure security to drug targeting in biological networks. This problem challenges you to compare two attack strategies, one based on degree and the other on eigenvector centrality, using a defined 'Disintegration Score' to quantify network damage. This exercise will sharpen your understanding of different centrality measures and their strategic importance in analyzing network robustness. ",

            "problem": "A systems biologist is modeling the robustness of a simplified protein-protein interaction network in a cancer cell, which consists of $N=10000$ proteins. The goal is to compare two potential drug targeting strategies that aim to disrupt the network by inactivating a fraction $f=0.05$ (or 5%) of the most central proteins. The disruption is measured by the impact on the network's Largest Connected Component (LCC).\n\nThe first strategy, 'Degree Attack', targets the top 5% of proteins ranked by their degree centrality (number of connections). The second strategy, 'Eigenvector Attack', targets the top 5% of proteins ranked by their eigenvector centrality. Eigenvector centrality is a measure of a node's influence, which is high if a node is connected to other influential nodes.\n\nTo quantify the damage caused by removing a set of proteins $R$, the biologist proposes a 'Disintegration Score' model, $\\Delta(R)$, defined as:\n$$ \\Delta(R) = \\sum_{i \\in R} \\left( \\alpha k_i + \\beta v_i^* \\right) $$\nwhere $k_i$ is the degree of protein $i$, and $v_i^*$ is its normalized eigenvector centrality (such that the sum of $v_i^*$ over all $N$ proteins in the network is 1). For this specific network model, the weighting parameters that relate these properties to network integrity are $\\alpha = 0.1$ and $\\beta = 50000$.\n\nLet $R_D$ be the set of proteins targeted by the Degree Attack, and $R_E$ be the set of proteins targeted by the Eigenvector Attack. The number of proteins in each set is $f \\times N$. Analysis of the network reveals the following average properties for these two sets of targeted proteins:\n\n- For the set $R_D$: The average degree is $\\langle k \\rangle_{R_D} = 150$, and the average normalized eigenvector centrality is $\\langle v^* \\rangle_{R_D} = 4.0 \\times 10^{-4}$.\n- For the set $R_E$: The average degree is $\\langle k \\rangle_{R_E} = 120$, and the average normalized eigenvector centrality is $\\langle v^* \\rangle_{R_E} = 6.0 \\times 10^{-4}$.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the Disintegration Score from the Eigenvector Attack to that from the Degree Attack, which is $\\frac{\\Delta(R_E)}{\\Delta(R_D)}$.
