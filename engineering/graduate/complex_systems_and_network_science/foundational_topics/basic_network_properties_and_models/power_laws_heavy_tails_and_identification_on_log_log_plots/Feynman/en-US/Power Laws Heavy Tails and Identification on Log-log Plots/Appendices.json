            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the ratio of the mean to the median for a Pareto (Type I) distribution, starting from first principles. The problem is well-posed, scientifically sound, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nFirst, we derive the cumulative distribution function (CDF), $F(x)$, from the given probability density function (PDF), $f(x) = \\alpha x_{\\min}^{\\alpha} x^{-(\\alpha+1)}$ for $x \\ge x_{\\min}$. The CDF is defined as $F(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{x} f(t) dt$. Since the support of the distribution is $[x_{\\min}, \\infty)$, the PDF is zero for $t < x_{\\min}$. Therefore, for any $x \\ge x_{\\min}$, the CDF is given by the integral:\n$$F(x) = \\int_{x_{\\min}}^{x} f(t) dt = \\int_{x_{\\min}}^{x} \\alpha x_{\\min}^{\\alpha} t^{-(\\alpha+1)} dt$$\nWe can factor out the constants with respect to the integration variable $t$:\n$$F(x) = \\alpha x_{\\min}^{\\alpha} \\int_{x_{\\min}}^{x} t^{-(\\alpha+1)} dt$$\nThe integral of $t^n$ is $\\frac{t^{n+1}}{n+1}$. Here, the exponent is $-(\\alpha+1)$, so the integral evaluates to:\n$$F(x) = \\alpha x_{\\min}^{\\alpha} \\left[ \\frac{t^{-(\\alpha+1)+1}}{-(\\alpha+1)+1} \\right]_{x_{\\min}}^{x} = \\alpha x_{\\min}^{\\alpha} \\left[ \\frac{t^{-\\alpha}}{-\\alpha} \\right]_{x_{\\min}}^{x}$$\nEvaluating the expression at the limits of integration:\n$$F(x) = \\alpha x_{\\min}^{\\alpha} \\left( \\frac{x^{-\\alpha}}{-\\alpha} - \\frac{x_{\\min}^{-\\alpha}}{-\\alpha} \\right) = -x_{\\min}^{\\alpha} (x^{-\\alpha} - x_{\\min}^{-\\alpha})$$\n$$F(x) = -x_{\\min}^{\\alpha} x^{-\\alpha} + x_{\\min}^{\\alpha} x_{\\min}^{-\\alpha} = - \\left(\\frac{x_{\\min}}{x}\\right)^{\\alpha} + 1$$\nSo, the cumulative distribution function for $x \\ge x_{\\min}$ is:\n$$F(x) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{x_{\\min}}{x}\\right)^{\\alpha}$$\nFor $x < x_{\\min}$, $F(x) = 0$.\n\nNext, we find the median, $m$. By definition, the median is the value of $x$ for which $F(x) = \\frac{1}{2}$. Since $\\alpha > 0$ and $x_{\\min} > 0$, the CDF is strictly increasing from $F(x_{\\min}) = 0$ to $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} F(x) = 1$, so a unique median exists and is greater than $x_{\\min}$. We set $F(m) = \\frac{1}{2}$:\n$$1 - \\left(\\frac{x_{\\min}}{m}\\right)^{\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nRearranging the terms to solve for $m$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{x_{\\min}}{m}\\right)^{\\alpha} = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nTaking the $\\alpha$-th root of both sides:\n$$\\frac{x_{\\min}}{m} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{1/\\alpha} = 2^{-1/\\alpha}$$\nSolving for $m$:\n$$m = \\frac{x_{\\min}}{2^{-1/\\alpha}} = x_{\\min} 2^{1/\\alpha}$$\n\nNow, we compute the mean, $\\mu$, of the distribution. The mean is the expected value of the random variable $X$, defined by $\\mu = E[X] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x f(x) dx$. The problem states that we assume $\\alpha > 1$, which is the condition required for the mean to be finite.\n$$\\mu = \\int_{x_{\\min}}^{\\infty} x \\left( \\alpha x_{\\min}^{\\alpha} x^{-(\\alpha+1)} \\right) dx$$\nCombining the terms involving $x$:\n$$\\mu = \\alpha x_{\\min}^{\\alpha} \\int_{x_{\\min}}^{\\infty} x \\cdot x^{-(\\alpha+1)} dx = \\alpha x_{\\min}^{\\alpha} \\int_{x_{\\min}}^{\\infty} x^{-\\alpha} dx$$\nWe integrate $x^{-\\alpha}$:\n$$\\mu = \\alpha x_{\\min}^{\\alpha} \\left[ \\frac{x^{-\\alpha+1}}{-\\alpha+1} \\right]_{x_{\\min}}^{\\infty}$$\nThe upper limit requires evaluating $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} x^{1-\\alpha}$. Since we assumed $\\alpha > 1$, the exponent $(1-\\alpha)$ is negative, so this limit is $0$.\n$$\\mu = \\frac{\\alpha x_{\\min}^{\\alpha}}{1-\\alpha} \\left( 0 - x_{\\min}^{1-\\alpha} \\right) = \\frac{\\alpha x_{\\min}^{\\alpha}}{-(\\alpha-1)} (-x_{\\min}^{1-\\alpha})$$\n$$\\mu = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha-1} x_{\\min}^{\\alpha} x_{\\min}^{1-\\alpha} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha-1} x_{\\min}^{\\alpha+1-\\alpha}$$\nThis simplifies to the expression for the mean:\n$$\\mu = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha-1} x_{\\min}$$\n\nFinally, we find the ratio of the mean to the median, $\\mu/m$.\n$$\\frac{\\mu}{m} = \\frac{\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha-1} x_{\\min}}{x_{\\min} 2^{1/\\alpha}}$$\nThe parameter $x_{\\min}$ cancels out, yielding the final expression as a function of $\\alpha$ only:\n$$\\frac{\\mu}{m} = \\frac{\\alpha}{(\\alpha-1) 2^{1/\\alpha}}$$\n\nFor $\\alpha > 1$, the ratio $\\mu/m$ is always greater than $1$, confirming the right-skewness of the distribution where the mean is pulled above the median by the heavy right tail.",

The Pareto distribution is a canonical model for heavy-tailed phenomena, and maximum likelihood estimation is a fundamental principle of statistical inference. The entire problem is a standard exercise in mathematical statistics.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed.

It asks for well-defined statistical quantities: the estimator and its asymptotic variance.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective mathematical language, free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. A rigorous derivation can be performed.\n\n### Derivation of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE)\n\nThe derivation proceeds by first finding the probability density function (PDF) from the given survival function, then constructing the log-likelihood function for the sample, and finally maximizing this function with respect to the parameter $\\alpha$.\n\n1.  **Probability Density Function (PDF):**\n    The cumulative distribution function (CDF) is $F(x) = P(X \\leq x) = 1 - P(X > x)$. Since the distribution is continuous, $P(X>x) = P(X\\geq x)$. Thus, for $x \\geq x_{\\min}$, the CDF is:\n    $$F(x; \\alpha) = 1 - S(x) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{x_{\\min}}{x}\\right)^{\\alpha}$$\n    The PDF, $p(x; \\alpha)$, is the derivative of the CDF with respect to $x$:\n    $$p(x; \\alpha) = \\frac{d}{dx} F(x; \\alpha) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left(1 - x_{\\min}^{\\alpha}x^{-\\alpha}\\right) = -x_{\\min}^{\\alpha} (-\\alpha) x^{-\\alpha-1}$$\n    This simplifies to the PDF for the Pareto Type I distribution:\n    $$p(x; \\alpha) = \\frac{\\alpha x_{\\min}^{\\alpha}}{x^{\\alpha+1}} \\quad \\text{for } x \\geq x_{\\min}$$\n\n2.  **Likelihood and Log-Likelihood Functions:**\n    Given an i.i.d. sample $\\{x_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{n}$, the likelihood function $L(\\alpha; \\{x_i\\})$ is the joint probability of observing the data:\n    $$L(\\alpha; \\{x_i\\}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} p(x_i; \\alpha) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\alpha x_{\\min}^{\\alpha}}{x_i^{\\alpha+1}}$$\n    To simplify maximization, we work with the log-likelihood function, $\\ell(\\alpha) = \\ln(L(\\alpha))$:\n    $$\\ell(\\alpha; \\{x_i\\}) = \\ln\\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\alpha x_{\\min}^{\\alpha}}{x_i^{\\alpha+1}} \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln\\left( \\frac{\\alpha x_{\\min}^{\\alpha}}{x_i^{\\alpha+1}} \\right)$$\n    $$\\ell(\\alpha) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left[ \\ln(\\alpha) + \\alpha \\ln(x_{\\min}) - (\\alpha+1) \\ln(x_i) \\right]$$\n    $$\\ell(\\alpha) = n \\ln(\\alpha) + n\\alpha \\ln(x_{\\min}) - (\\alpha+1) \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln(x_i)$$\n\n3.  **Maximization:**\n    To find the MLE, $\\hat{\\alpha}_{ML}$, we differentiate $\\ell(\\alpha)$ with respect to $\\alpha$ and set the result to zero (the first-order condition):\n    $$\\frac{d\\ell}{d\\alpha} = \\frac{n}{\\alpha} + n \\ln(x_{\\min}) - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln(x_i) = 0$$\n    Solving for $\\alpha$ gives the estimator $\\hat{\\alpha}_{ML}$:\n    $$\\frac{n}{\\hat{\\alpha}_{ML}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln(x_i) - n \\ln(x_{\\min}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\ln(x_i) - \\ln(x_{\\min}) \\right)$$\n    $$\\frac{n}{\\hat{\\alpha}_{ML}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_i}{x_{\\min}}\\right)$$\n    Thus, the closed-form MLE for $\\alpha$ is:\n    $$\\hat{\\alpha}_{ML} = \\frac{n}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_i}{x_{\\min}}\\right)}$$\n    To confirm this is a maximum, we check the second derivative:\n    $$\\frac{d^2\\ell}{d\\alpha^2} = -\\frac{n}{\\alpha^2}$$\n    Since $n>0$ and $\\alpha^2>0$, the second derivative is always negative, confirming the log-likelihood function is concave and the stationary point is a global maximum.\n\n### Derivation of the Asymptotic Variance\n\nThe asymptotic variance of an MLE is given by the inverse of the Fisher information.\n\n1.  **Fisher Information:**\n    The Fisher information $I(\\alpha)$ for a sample of size $n$ is $n$ times the Fisher information for a single observation, $I_1(\\alpha)$. For a single parameter, $I_1(\\alpha)$ can be calculated as:\n    $$I_1(\\alpha) = -E\\left[ \\frac{d^2}{d\\alpha^2} \\ln(p(x; \\alpha)) \\right]$$\n    From our earlier work, the log-PDF for a single observation is $\\ln(p(x; \\alpha)) = \\ln(\\alpha) + \\alpha \\ln(x_{\\min}) - (\\alpha+1) \\ln(x)$.\n    The second derivative with respect to $\\alpha$ is:\n    $$\\frac{d^2}{d\\alpha^2} \\ln(p(x; \\alpha)) = \\frac{d}{d\\alpha} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha} + \\ln(x_{\\min}) - \\ln(x)\\right) = -\\frac{1}{\\alpha^2}$$\n    Since this expression does not depend on the random variable $x$, its expectation is the expression itself:\n    $$E\\left[ \\frac{d^2}{d\\alpha^2} \\ln(p(x; \\alpha)) \\right] = -\\frac{1}{\\alpha^2}$$\n    Therefore, the Fisher information for a single observation is:\n    $$I_1(\\alpha) = - \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\alpha^2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha^2}$$\n    The total Fisher information for the sample of size $n$ is:\n    $$I(\\alpha) = n I_1(\\alpha) = \\frac{n}{\\alpha^2}$$\n\n2.  **Asymptotic Variance:**\n    Under standard regularity conditions, the MLE $\\hat{\\alpha}_{ML}$ is asymptotically normally distributed with a variance equal to the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound, which is the inverse of the Fisher information.\n    $$\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\alpha}_{ML}) \\approx [I(\\alpha)]^{-1} = \\frac{\\alpha^2}{n}$$\n    This is the theoretical asymptotic variance of the estimator, which depends on the true unknown parameter $\\alpha$. The problem requires the final result to be expressed in terms of the sample data. A consistent estimator for the asymptotic variance is obtained by substituting the MLE $\\hat{\\alpha}_{ML}$ for the true parameter $\\alpha$:\n    $$\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\hat{\\alpha}_{ML}) = \\frac{\\hat{\\alpha}_{ML}^2}{n} = \\frac{1}{n} \\left( \\frac{n}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_i}{x_{\\min}}\\right)} \\right)^2 = \\frac{n}{\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_i}{x_{\\min}}\\right) \\right)^2}$$\n    This expression provides the estimated asymptotic variance based on the sample data.\n\nThe two required expressions are the estimator $\\hat{\\alpha}_{ML}$ and its estimated asymptotic variance.",

            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of the effects of network subsampling on a heavy-tailed degree distribution. The analysis is divided into three parts: first, deriving the asymptotic relationship between the true degree Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF), $\\bar{F}(k)$, and the observed degree CCDF, $\\bar{F}_f(k)$; second, quantifying the effect of this relationship on a log-log plot; and third, deriving a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the tail exponent $\\alpha$ that corrects for the subsampling fraction $f$.\n\nLet $K$ be the true degree of a node, a random variable with CCDF $\\bar{F}(k) = \\mathbb{P}(K \\ge k)$. For large $k$, the tail is regularly varying: $\\bar{F}(k) \\sim L(k)\\,k^{1-\\alpha}$ for some $\\alpha > 1$ and a slowly varying function $L(\\cdot)$. Let $D$ be the observed degree after subsampling. Conditional on $K=k$, the observed degree $D$ follows a binomial distribution, $D \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(k,f)$, where $f \\in (0,1)$ is the sampling probability.\n\nThe CCDF of the observed degree $D$, denoted $\\bar{F}_f(k) = \\mathbb{P}(D \\ge k)$, can be expressed using the law of total probability, by averaging over all possible values of the true degree $K$:\n$$ \\bar{F}_f(k) = \\mathbb{P}(D \\ge k) = \\mathbb{E}_K\\left[ \\mathbb{P}(D \\ge k | K) \\right] = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\mathbb{P}(D \\ge k | K=j) \\mathbb{P}(K=j) $$\nSince a node with observed degree $D \\ge k$ must have a true degree of at least $k$, the sum starts at $j=k$:\n$$ \\bar{F}_f(k) = \\sum_{j=k}^{\\infty} \\mathbb{P}(\\mathrm{Binomial}(j,f) \\ge k) \\mathbb{P}(K=j) $$\n\nThe first part of the problem asks to derive the asymptotic behavior of $\\bar{F}_f(k)$ for large $k$. The key insight comes from the concentration of the binomial distribution. For a large number of trials $j$, the binomial random variable $\\mathrm{Binomial}(j,f)$ is sharply concentrated around its mean $jf$. Concentration inequalities, such as the Chernoff bound, formally state that the probability of significant deviation from the mean is exponentially small in $j$.\nThis implies that the function $g(j) = \\mathbb{P}(\\mathrm{Binomial}(j,f) \\ge k)$ behaves essentially as a step function for large $k$.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item If $j$ is substantially smaller than $k/f$, then $jf \\ll k$. The probability of observing $k$ or more successes is negligible, so $g(j) \\approx 0$.\n    \\item If $j$ is substantially larger than $k/f$, then $jf \\gg k$. The probability of observing at least $k$ successes is very close to $1$, so $g(j) \\approx 1$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe transition between these two regimes occurs in a narrow region around $j \\approx k/f$. Because the true degree distribution $\\mathbb{P}(K=j)$ is heavy-tailed and decays slowly (as a power law), the sum for $\\bar{F}_f(k)$ is dominated by the behavior of the terms where $\\mathbb{P}(K=j)$ is largest and $g(j)$ is non-negligible. This occurs for the smallest values of $j$ where $g(j) \\approx 1$, i.e., for $j \\ge k/f$.\nTherefore, we can approximate the sum by taking $g(j)$ to be a step function that is $0$ for $j < k/f$ and $1$ for $j \\ge k/f$:\n$$ \\bar{F}_f(k) \\approx \\sum_{j=\\lceil k/f \\rceil}^{\\infty} \\mathbb{P}(K=j) = \\mathbb{P}(K \\ge \\lceil k/f \\rceil) $$\nFor large $k$, we can ignore the ceiling function and treat $k/f$ as continuous. This gives the asymptotic relationship:\n$$ \\bar{F}_f(k) \\sim \\bar{F}(k/f) $$\nThis expression reveals how subsampling biases the tail: the probability of observing a degree of at least $k$ is approximately equal to the probability that the true degree was at least $k/f$.\n\nFor the second part, we use the specific Pareto Type I form for the true degree tail, $\\bar{F}(k) = \\left(\\frac{k}{k_{\\min}}\\right)^{1-\\alpha}$ for $k \\ge k_{\\min}$. We apply the derived asymptotic relationship. This is valid for observed degrees $k$ such that the argument of $\\bar{F}$ is above its threshold, i.e., $k/f \\ge k_{\\min}$, or $k \\ge f k_{\\min}$.\n$$ \\bar{F}_f(k) \\sim \\bar{F}(k/f) = \\left(\\frac{k/f}{k_{\\min}}\\right)^{1-\\alpha} = (f^{-1})^{1-\\alpha} \\left(\\frac{k}{k_{\\min}}\\right)^{1-\\alpha} = f^{\\alpha-1} \\left(\\frac{k}{k_{\\min}}\\right)^{1-\\alpha} $$\nTo analyze the scaling on a log-log plot, we take the natural logarithm of both the true and observed CCDFs.\nFor the true distribution:\n$$ \\ln(\\bar{F}(k)) = (1-\\alpha) \\ln\\left(\\frac{k}{k_{\\min}}\\right) = (1-\\alpha)\\ln(k) - (1-\\alpha)\\ln(k_{\\min}) $$\nFor the observed distribution:\n$$ \\ln(\\bar{F}_f(k)) \\approx \\ln\\left(f^{\\alpha-1} \\left(\\frac{k}{k_{\\min}}\\right)^{1-\\alpha}\\right) = (\\alpha-1)\\ln(f) + (1-\\alpha)\\ln(k) - (1-\\alpha)\\ln(k_{\\min}) $$\nComparing the two expressions, we can identify the slope and the vertical shift on a log-log plot (where the y-axis is $\\ln(\\bar{F})$ and the x-axis is $\\ln(k)$).\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item **Slope**: The coefficient of $\\ln(k)$ is $(1-\\alpha)$ for both distributions. Thus, the power-law exponent is preserved under subsampling, and the slope of the tail on a log-log plot remains unchanged.\n    \\item **Vertical Shift**: The difference in the vertical position of the two curves is $\\ln(\\bar{F}_f(k)) - \\ln(\\bar{F}(k)) = (\\alpha-1)\\ln(f)$. Since $f \\in (0,1)$, $\\ln(f)$ is negative. Since $\\alpha > 1$, the vertical shift $(\\alpha-1)\\ln(f)$ is negative. This means the observed tail is shifted downwards on the log-log plot relative to the true tail.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nFor the final part, we derive the MLE for $\\alpha$. The problem specifies using a continuous Pareto Type I approximation for the observed tail, based on the data $d_1, d_2, \\dots, d_n$, where each $d_i \\ge f k_{\\min}$. From our previous analysis, the CCDF of the observed degrees $D$ for $d \\ge f k_{\\min}$ is modeled by:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(D \\ge d) = \\left(\\frac{d}{f k_{\\min}}\\right)^{1-\\alpha} $$\nThis is the CCDF of a continuous Pareto Type I distribution with tail exponent $\\alpha$ and a lower cutoff (minimum value) of $d_{\\min}' = f k_{\\min}$. The corresponding probability density function (PDF) $p_f(d)$ for $d \\ge f k_{\\min}$ is:\n$$ p_f(d) = -\\frac{d}{dd} \\left(\\frac{d}{f k_{\\min}}\\right)^{1-\\alpha} = - (f k_{\\min})^{\\alpha-1} (1-\\alpha) d^{-\\alpha} = (\\alpha-1) (f k_{\\min})^{\\alpha-1} d^{-\\alpha} $$\nThe likelihood function $L(\\alpha)$ for an i.i.d. sample $d_1, \\dots, d_n$ is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$ L(\\alpha | \\{d_i\\}, f, k_{\\min}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} p_f(d_i) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\left[ (\\alpha-1) (f k_{\\min})^{\\alpha-1} d_i^{-\\alpha} \\right] $$\n$$ L(\\alpha) = \\left( (\\alpha-1) (f k_{\\min})^{\\alpha-1} \\right)^n \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{n} d_i \\right)^{-\\alpha} $$\nTo simplify maximization, we use the log-likelihood function, $\\ell(\\alpha) = \\ln(L(\\alpha))$:\n$$ \\ell(\\alpha) = n \\ln(\\alpha-1) + n(\\alpha-1)\\ln(f k_{\\min}) - \\alpha \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln(d_i) $$\nWe find the MLE, $\\hat{\\alpha}$, by differentiating $\\ell(\\alpha)$ with respect to $\\alpha$ and setting the result to zero:\n$$ \\frac{d\\ell}{d\\alpha} = \\frac{n}{\\alpha-1} + n\\ln(f k_{\\min}) - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln(d_i) = 0 $$\nNow, we solve for $\\alpha$:\n$$ \\frac{n}{\\alpha-1} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln(d_i) - n\\ln(f k_{\\min}) $$\n$$ \\frac{n}{\\alpha-1} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\\ln(d_i) - \\ln(f k_{\\min})) $$\n$$ \\frac{n}{\\alpha-1} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln\\left(\\frac{d_i}{f k_{\\min}}\\right) $$\nInverting this expression gives $\\alpha-1$:\n$$ \\alpha-1 = \\frac{n}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln\\left(\\frac{d_i}{f k_{\\min}}\\right)} $$\nFinally, the corrected estimator for the tail exponent $\\alpha$ is:\n$$ \\hat{\\alpha} = 1 + \\frac{n}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln\\left(\\frac{d_i}{f k_{\\min}}\\right)} $$\nThis estimator correctly accounts for the subsampling fraction $f$ by effectively treating the observed data as being drawn from a Pareto distribution with a shifted minimum value of $f k_{\\min}$.",
