The formation of a link between any one pair of neurons is statistically independent of the formation of all other links. The total number of such links in the network is a key measure of its overall connectivity.\n\nBased on this model, what is the expected total number of bidirectional synaptic links in the network?

While the edges in a $G(n,p)$ model are formed independently, it does not imply that all node-level properties are independent.

The connectivity of this network is modeled using the Erdős-Rényi random graph framework, denoted as $G(n,p)$. In this model, the $n$ nodes are represented as vertices, and a direct communication link (an edge) is established between any pair of distinct nodes independently with a probability $p$.\n\nA fundamental requirement for the network's operation is that no node is completely cut off from the system. This property corresponds to the graph having no isolated vertices. An isolated vertex is a vertex with a degree of zero.\n\nThe emergence of this property in the network is known to exhibit a sharp threshold phenomenon. A function $t(n)$ is called a threshold probability function for a given graph property if, for a link probability $p(n)$:\n- if $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{p(n)}{t(n)} = 0$, then the property almost surely does not occur (the probability of it occurring tends to 0 as $n \\to \\infty$).\n- if $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{p(n)}{t(n)} = \\infty$, then the property almost surely does occur (the probability of it occurring tends to 1 as $n \\to \\infty$).\n\nDetermine the threshold probability function $t(n)$ for the property that the graph $G(n,p)$ has no isolated vertices.

A vertex is isolated if none of its $n-1$ incident edges are present, so $\\Pr(I_{v}=1)=(1-p)^{n-1}$. Let $X=\\sum_{v=1}^{n} I_{v}$ denote the number of isolated vertices.
