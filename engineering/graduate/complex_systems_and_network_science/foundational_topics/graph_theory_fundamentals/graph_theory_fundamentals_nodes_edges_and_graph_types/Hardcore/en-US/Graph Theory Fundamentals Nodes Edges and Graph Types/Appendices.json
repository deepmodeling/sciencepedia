For a simple undirected graph, each edge $(i, j)$ corresponds to two entries in the adjacency matrix, $M_{ij}=1$ and $M_{ji}=1$. Therefore, the total number of edges $m$ is half the sum of all entries in the matrix.\n$$\nm = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{8} \\sum_{j=1}^{8} M_{ij}\n$$\nThe sum of all entries is also equal to the sum of all degrees:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{8} \\sum_{j=1}^{8} M_{ij} = \\sum_{i=1}^{8} \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{8} M_{ij} \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{8} d_i = 26\n$$\nTherefore, the number of edges is:\n$$\nm = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 26 = 13\n$$\nAlternatively, we can count the number of $1$s in the upper triangle of the matrix $M$ (where $ji$):\n$m = \\sum_{i=1}^{8} \\sum_{j=i+1}^{8} M_{ij} = (M_{12}+M_{14}+M_{17}) + (M_{23}+M_{25}+M_{26}) + (M_{34}+M_{37}) + M_{48} + (M_{56}+M_{58}) + M_{67} + M_{78}$\n$m = (1+1+1) + (1+1+1) + (1+1) + 1 + (1+1) + 1 + 1 = 3+3+2+1+2+1+1 = 13$.\nBoth methods confirm that $m=13$.\n\nFinally, we compute the discrepancy $\\Delta$. The problem asks for the numerical verification of the handshaking lemma, which states that $\\sum d_i = 2m$. The discrepancy $\\Delta$ is defined to measure any deviation from this identity.\n$$\n\\Delta \\equiv \\sum_{i=1}^{8} d_i - 2m\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$\\sum_{i=1}^{8} d_i = 26$\n$m = 13$, which gives $2m = 2 \\times 13 = 26$.\n$$\n\\Delta = 26 - 26 = 0\n$$\nThe result is $0$, which numerically verifies the handshaking lemma for the given graph.",

Finally, report the total number of directed edges in the condensation graph. Express your final answer as a single integer with no units. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "We begin from the core definitions. The adjacency matrix $A$ of a directed graph on nodes $\\{1,2,\\dots,n\\}$ satisfies $a_{ij}=1$ if and only if there is a directed edge from node $i$ to node $j$, and $a_{ij}=0$ otherwise. In the boolean semiring, the $(i,j)$ entry of the boolean product $A^{k}$ equals $1$ if and only if there exists a directed walk of length exactly $k$ from node $i$ to node $j$. The reachability relation can be captured by the boolean transitive closure\n$$\nR \\;=\\; I \\,\\vee\\, A \\,\\vee\\, A^{2} \\,\\vee\\, \\cdots \\,\\vee\\, A^{n-1},\n$$\nwhere $I$ is the identity matrix, and $\\vee$ denotes entrywise logical disjunction. Nodes $i$ and $j$ are in the same strongly connected component if and only if $R_{ij}=1$ and $R_{ji}=1$, that is, each can reach the other via some directed path.\n\nRather than enumerating all boolean powers explicitly, we use the structure encoded by $A$ to establish mutual reachability.\n\nFrom the given $A$, we read the edges:\n- Within the subset $\\{1,2,3\\}$ there are edges $1\\to 2$, $2\\to 3$, and $3\\to 1$, forming a directed cycle. Hence $1$ reaches $2$, $2$ reaches $3$, and $3$ reaches $1$, and by concatenation each of $1$, $2$, $3$ reach each other. Therefore $\\{1,2,3\\}$ is a strongly connected component.\n- Within the subset $\\{4,5\\}$ there are edges $4\\to 5$ and $5\\to 4$, yielding mutual reachability between $4$ and $5$. Therefore $\\{4,5\\}$ is a strongly connected component.\n- Within the subset $\\{7,8,9\\}$ there are edges $7\\to 8$, $8\\to 9$, and $9\\to 7$, again forming a directed cycle, so $\\{7,8,9\\}$ is a strongly connected component.\n- Node $6$ has an outgoing edge $6\\to 7$ but there is no directed path from any of $7$, $8$, $9$ back to $6$ (no edges in $A$ lead into $6$ from $\\{7,8,9\\}$ or their descendants). There is no self-loop $6\\to 6$. Thus $6$ is not mutually reachable with any other node and forms a singleton strongly connected component $\\{6\\}$.\n\nIt remains to verify that no edges create mutual reachability across these identified components. We examine inter-component edges read from $A$:\n- From $\\{1,2,3\\}$ to $\\{4,5\\}$ there are edges $2\\to 4$ and $3\\to 5$.\n- From $\\{1,2,3\\}$ to $\\{6\\}$ there is edge $1\\to 6$.\n- From $\\{1,2,3\\}$ to $\\{7,8,9\\}$ there is edge $3\\to 9$.\n- From $\\{4,5\\}$ to $\\{6\\}$ there is edge $4\\to 6$.\n- From $\\{4,5\\}$ to $\\{7,8,9\\}$ there is edge $5\\to 7$.\n- From $\\{6\\}$ to $\\{7,8,9\\}$ there is edge $6\\to 7$.\n\nThere are no edges from any of $\\{4,5\\}$, $\\{6\\}$, or $\\{7,8,9\\}$ back to any node in $\\{1,2,3\\}$; no edges from $\\{6\\}$ or $\\{7,8,9\\}$ back to $\\{4,5\\}$; and no edges from $\\{7,8,9\\}$ back to $\\{6\\}$. Therefore, no additional mutual reachability arises across these components, confirming that the strongly connected components are exactly\n$$\nC_{1}=\\{1,2,3\\},\\quad C_{2}=\\{4,5\\},\\quad C_{3}=\\{6\\},\\quad C_{4}=\\{7,8,9\\}.\n$$\n\nWe now construct the condensation graph $G^{\\ast}$ whose nodes are the components $C_{1},C_{2},C_{3},C_{4}$. There is a directed edge $C_{i}\\to C_{j}$ in $G^{\\ast}$ if and only if there exists at least one edge in the original graph from a node in $C_{i}$ to a node in $C_{j}$. Using the inter-component edges identified above, we obtain:\n- $C_{1}\\to C_{2}$ (since $2\\to 4$ and $3\\to 5$),\n- $C_{1}\\to C_{3}$ (since $1\\to 6$),\n- $C_{1}\\to C_{4}$ (since $3\\to 9$),\n- $C_{2}\\to C_{3}$ (since $4\\to 6$),\n- $C_{2}\\to C_{4}$ (since $5\\to 7$),\n- $C_{3}\\to C_{4}$ (since $6\\to 7$).\n\nNo other inter-component edges exist.

            "solution": "We begin from first principles. A bipartite graph $G=(L \\cup R,E)$ has its vertex set partitioned into two disjoint parts $L$ and $R$, and every edge has one endpoint in $L$ and the other in $R$. A matching $M \\subseteq E$ is a set of edges no two of which share a common endpoint. A matching is maximum if it has the largest possible cardinality among all matchings. A vertex cover $C \\subseteq L \\cup R$ is a set of vertices such that every edge in $E$ has at least one endpoint in $C$. A vertex cover is minimum if it has the smallest possible cardinality among all vertex covers.\n\nA fundamental lower bound relates matchings and vertex covers: if $M$ is a matching with $|M|=k$, then any vertex cover $C$ must have $|C| \\geq k$. The reason is that edges in a matching are pairwise disjoint, so to cover each edge in $M$, the cover must include at least one endpoint of each of the $k$ edges, and no single vertex can cover two distinct matched edges since those edges share no endpoints.\n\nWe now construct a large matching by explicit selection and verify that it is maximum by bounding reasons. Consider\n$$\nM=\\{(\\ell_2,r_1),(\\ell_1,r_2),(\\ell_4,r_3),(\\ell_3,r_4),(\\ell_7,r_5),(\\ell_5,r_6),(\\ell_6,r_7)\\}.\n$$\nEach of these pairs is in $E$ by inspection of the given edge list. We verify that $M$ is a matching: the left endpoints are $\\ell_2,\\ell_1,\\ell_4,\\ell_3,\\ell_7,\\ell_5,\\ell_6$, all distinct, and the right endpoints are $r_1,r_2,r_3,r_4,r_5,r_6,r_7$, also all distinct. Therefore, no two edges in $M$ share a vertex, and $M$ is indeed a matching. Its size is $|M|=7$.\n\nThe size of any matching cannot exceed $\\min(|L|,|R|)$. Here, $|L|=7$ and $|R|=7$, so any matching has size at most $7$. Since we have exhibited a matching of size $7$, it follows that $M$ is a maximum matching and the matching number (the size of a maximum matching) is $7$.\n\nNext, we construct a minimum vertex cover and justify its minimality. A standard constructive relationship between maximum matchings and minimum vertex covers in bipartite graphs proceeds via alternating paths, but we can reason directly here. Since we have a perfect matching on $L$ (every $\\ell_i$ is matched in $M$), any vertex cover must have size at least $7$ by the lower bound above. On the other hand, the set $L$ itself is a vertex cover: for every edge $(\\ell_i,r_j) \\in E$, the left endpoint $\\ell_i$ is in $L$, so the edge is covered. Therefore, $C=L$ is a vertex cover with $|C|=7$.\n\nCombining these facts, the minimum vertex cover size is at most $7$ because $L$ is a cover of size $7$, and at least $7$ because any cover must cover the $7$ disjoint edges of $M$. Hence, the minimum vertex cover size is exactly $7$.\n\nThus, the size of a maximum matching and the size of a minimum vertex cover are equal and equal to $7$, as required by the relationship between matchings and vertex covers in bipartite graphs. The requested common size is $7$.",
