This first exercise  provides essential practice in translating this matrix representation into fundamental graph properties, specifically the degree of each node. By calculating the degree sequence, you will then numerically verify the handshaking lemma, a cornerstone theorem that establishes a simple yet powerful relationship between the local property of node degrees ($d_i$) and the global property of the total number of edges ($m$).",

            "problem": "Consider a simple undirected graph with $n=8$ nodes representing symmetric pairwise interactions among $8$ identical components in a complex system. The graph is represented by its adjacency matrix $M \\in \\{0,1\\}^{8 \\times 8}$, where $M_{ij}=1$ if there is an edge between node $i$ and node $j$, and $M_{ij}=0$ otherwise. The matrix $M$ is symmetric and has zeros on its diagonal, consistent with the definition of a simple undirected graph. The matrix $M$ is given by\n$$\nM=\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nUsing the fundamental definitions of degree and adjacency in graph theory, compute the degree sequence by $d_i=\\sum_{j=1}^{8} M_{ij}$ for $i=1,2,\\dots,8$, and verify the handshaking lemma numerically by computing the discrepancy\n$$\n\\Delta \\equiv \\sum_{i=1}^{8} d_i - 2m,\n$$\nwhere $m$ is the number of edges in the graph computed directly from $M$.

For a simple undirected graph, each edge $(i, j)$ corresponds to two entries in the adjacency matrix, $M_{ij}=1$ and $M_{ji}=1$. Therefore, the total number of edges $m$ is half the sum of all entries in the matrix.\n$$\nm = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{8} \\sum_{j=1}^{8} M_{ij}\n$$\nThe sum of all entries is also equal to the sum of all degrees:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{8} \\sum_{j=1}^{8} M_{ij} = \\sum_{i=1}^{8} \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{8} M_{ij} \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{8} d_i = 26\n$$\nTherefore, the number of edges is:\n$$\nm = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 26 = 13\n$$\nAlternatively, we can count the number of $1$s in the upper triangle of the matrix $M$ (where $j>i$):\n$m = \\sum_{i=1}^{8} \\sum_{j=i+1}^{8} M_{ij} = (M_{12}+M_{14}+M_{17}) + (M_{23}+M_{25}+M_{26}) + (M_{34}+M_{37}) + M_{48} + (M_{56}+M_{58}) + M_{67} + M_{78}$\n$m = (1+1+1) + (1+1+1) + (1+1) + 1 + (1+1) + 1 + 1 = 3+3+2+1+2+1+1 = 13$.\nBoth methods confirm that $m=13$.\n\nFinally, we compute the discrepancy $\\Delta$. The problem asks for the numerical verification of the handshaking lemma, which states that $\\sum d_i = 2m$. The discrepancy $\\Delta$ is defined to measure any deviation from this identity.\n$$\n\\Delta \\equiv \\sum_{i=1}^{8} d_i - 2m\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$\\sum_{i=1}^{8} d_i = 26$\n$m = 13$, which gives $2m = 2 \\times 13 = 26$.\n$$\n\\Delta = 26 - 26 = 0\n$$\nThe result is $0$, which numerically verifies the handshaking lemma for the given graph.",

Finally, report the total number of directed edges in the condensation graph. Express your final answer as a single integer with no units. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "We begin from the core definitions. Two nodes $i$ and $j$ are in the same strongly connected component (SCC) if and only if there is a directed path from $i$ to $j$ and a directed path from $j$ to $i$. We can find these components by identifying cycles in the graph.\n\nFrom the given adjacency matrix $A$, we identify the directed edges and look for cycles:\n- **Cycle 1**: We observe the edges $1\\to 2$, $2\\to 3$, and $3\\to 1$. This forms a directed cycle, meaning all nodes in $\\{1,2,3\\}$ are mutually reachable. Thus, $\\{1,2,3\\}$ is an SCC.\n- **Cycle 2**: We observe the edges $4\\to 5$ and $5\\to 4$. This forms a directed 2-cycle, so $\\{4,5\\}$ is an SCC.\n- **Cycle 3**: We observe the edges $7\\to 8$, $8\\to 9$, and $9\\to 7$. This forms another 3-cycle, so $\\{7,8,9\\}$ is an SCC.\n- **Node 6**: There is no edge starting from node 6 that leads back to it via any path (e.g., no edges enter node 6 at all). Therefore, node 6 forms a singleton SCC, $\\{6\\}$.\n\nThis partitions the set of all 9 nodes. To confirm these are the maximal such sets, we check that there is no mutual reachability between these components. We list the edges that run between the identified components:\n- From $C_1=\\{1,2,3\\}$: $1\\to 6$, $2\\to 4$, $3\\to 5$, $3\\to 9$.\n- From $C_2=\\{4,5\\}$: $4\\to 6$, $5\\to 7$.\n- From $C_3=\\{6\\}$: $6\\to 7$.\n- From $C_4=\\{7,8,9\\}$: No edges leave this component to go to another.\n\nSince there are no paths leading back from a later component to an earlier one in the sequence $(C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4)$, our partition is correct. The SCCs are:\n$$\nC_{1}=\\{1,2,3\\},\\quad C_{2}=\\{4,5\\},\\quad C_{3}=\\{6\\},\\quad C_{4}=\\{7,8,9\\}.\n$$\nNext, we construct the condensation graph $G^{\\ast}$, where each node represents an SCC. An edge exists from $C_i$ to $C_j$ in $G^{\\ast}$ if there is at least one edge in the original graph from a node in $C_i$ to a node in $C_j$.\n\nBased on the inter-component edges listed above:\n- $C_{1}\\to C_{2}$ (due to $2\\to 4$)\n- $C_{1}\\to C_{3}$ (due to $1\\to 6$)\n- $C_{1}\\to C_{4}$ (due to $3\\to 9$)\n- $C_{2}\\to C_{3}$ (due to $4\\to 6$)\n- $C_{2}\\to C_{4}$ (due to $5\\to 7$)\n- $C_{3}\\to C_{4}$ (due to $6\\to 7$)\n\nWe count these unique directed edges in the condensation graph.

In graph $G$, the vertices $\\{u_1, u_2, u_3\\}$ form a 3-cycle (triangle), the vertices $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$ form another 3-cycle, and these two triangles are connected by the edges $\\{u_1v_1, u_2v_2, u_3v_3\\}$, which form a perfect matching. This is the graph of a triangular prism. Graph $H$ has an identical structure: vertices $\\{a, b, c\\}$ form a triangle, vertices $\\{d, e, f\\}$ form a triangle, and they are connected by the matching $\\{ad, be, cf\\}$.\nSince both graphs have the same structure, they are isomorphic. A valid isomorphism $\\varphi: V(G) \\to V(H)$ is $\\varphi(u_i)=a_i$ and $\\varphi(v_i)=b_i$, where $(a_1,a_2,a_3)=(a,b,c)$ and $(b_1,b_2,b_3)=(d,e,f)$.\n\nTo find the number of automorphisms of $G$, $|\\mathrm{Aut}(G)|$, we use the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem: $|\\mathrm{Aut}(G)| = |\\mathrm{Orb}(x)| \\cdot |\\mathrm{Stab}(x)|$ for any vertex $x \\in V(G)$.\n\n1.  **Find the size of the orbit of a vertex.** An orbit of a vertex $x$ is the set of all vertices to which $x$ can be mapped by some automorphism. We check if $G$ is vertex-transitive.\n    *   Consider the permutation that rotates the vertices within each triangle: $(u_1 u_2 u_3)(v_1 v_2 v_3)$. This is an automorphism. It can map $u_1$ to $u_2$ or $u_3$.\n    *   Consider the permutation that swaps the two triangles: $(u_1 v_1)(u_2 v_2)(u_3 v_3)$. This is also an automorphism. It can map $u_1$ to $v_1$.\n    *   By combining these automorphisms, any vertex can be mapped to any other vertex. For example, to map $u_1$ to $v_2$, we can first swap triangles (map $u_1 \\to v_1$) and then rotate (map $v_1 \\to v_2$).\n    *   Thus, the graph is vertex-transitive. All 6 vertices belong to a single orbit. So, for any vertex $x$, $|\\mathrm{Orb}(x)| = 6$.\n\n2.  **Find the size of the stabilizer of a vertex.** The stabilizer of a vertex $x$, $\\mathrm{Stab}(x)$, is the set of automorphisms that fix $x$. Let's choose $x = u_1$.\n    *   Any automorphism $\\sigma$ that fixes $u_1$ must map the set of its neighbors, $N(u_1) = \\{u_2, u_3, v_1\\}$, to itself.\n    *   In the subgraph induced by $N(u_1)$, there is only one edge: $\\{u_2, u_3\\}$. Since automorphisms preserve adjacency, this edge must be mapped to itself. This implies that the vertex $v_1$ (which is not part of the edge) must also be fixed by $\\sigma$. So, $\\sigma(v_1) = v_1$.\n    *   The mapping of the edge $\\{u_2, u_3\\}$ to itself allows two possibilities:\n        *   **Identity**: $\\sigma(u_2) = u_2$ and $\\sigma(u_3) = u_3$. This mapping, combined with $\\sigma(u_1)=u_1$ and $\\sigma(v_1)=v_1$, uniquely extends to the identity automorphism on all of $V(G)$.\n        *   **Reflection**: $\\sigma(u_2) = u_3$ and $\\sigma(u_3) = u_2$. This mapping extends to a unique automorphism: we must have $\\sigma(v_2) = v_3$ and $\\sigma(v_3) = v_2$ to preserve the matching edges $\\{u_2, v_2\\}$ and $\\{u_3, v_3\\}$. This corresponds to the permutation $(u_2 u_3)(v_2 v_3)$, which is a valid automorphism.\n    *   Therefore, the stabilizer of $u_1$ contains exactly two automorphisms. So, $|\\mathrm{Stab}(u_1)| = 2$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the order of the automorphism group.**\n    Using the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem:\n    $$|\\mathrm{Aut}(G)| = |\\mathrm{Orb}(u_1)| \\cdot |\\mathrm{Stab}(u_1)| = 6 \\cdot 2 = 12.$$\nThe total number of automorphisms of $G$ is 12.",
