Suppose the network dynamics in the small-signal regime are approximated by the linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) $\\dot{x} = W x$, where $W = (w_{ij})$ is the signed weighted adjacency matrix and $x$ is the vector of node states.

A simple cycle is a directed closed walk that does not repeat nodes except for the starting/ending node, and its length is the number of edges it traverses. The polarity of a simple cycle is defined as the product of the signs of the edge weights along the cycle. The loop gain of a simple cycle is defined as the product of the absolute values of the edge weights along the cycle.\n\nFrom first principles of linearized network interactions, identify all simple cycles of length less than or equal to $3$, compute the polarity and loop gain of each such cycle, and qualitatively interpret how each cycle’s polarity would affect small perturbation growth or attenuation in the immediate neighborhood of the equilibrium.

We have shown that a Hopf bifurcation occurs at $\\mu_H = \\lambda$ provided that $\\Delta(\\mu_H) = -\\lambda^2 - ab  0$, and that the crossing is transverse.\n\nFor the second part, we must compute the angular oscillation frequency at the onset of the Hopf bifurcation.
