This exercise introduces one of the most powerful and classic techniques for doing so: mean-field theory. By analyzing the Ising model—a foundational model of interacting agents—you will derive a self-consistency equation that connects the macroscopic order parameter (magnetization, $m$) to the underlying microscopic interaction parameters. This practice  demonstrates how a complex web of local interactions can be approximated by a single, holistic \"effective field,\" allowing for the analytical prediction of emergent phenomena like phase transitions.",

No contradictions are present.\n- **Unrealistic or Infeasible**: The Ising model is an idealized physical model, but it is a standard and scientifically invaluable tool. The problem does not contain unrealistic data or impossible conditions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n- **Verdict**: The problem is valid.\n- **Action**: Proceed with a full, reasoned solution.\n\n### Solution\n\n**Justification of Magnetization as an Order Parameter**\n\nAn order parameter is a quantity that is zero in one phase (typically the more symmetric, high-temperature, disordered phase) and non-zero in another (the less symmetric, low-temperature, ordered phase). The Hamiltonian $H(s) = -J \\sum_{\\langle ij \\rangle} s_i s_j$ possesses a global $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry: if every spin in the system is flipped, $s_i \\to -s_i$ for all $i$, the product of any pair of spins is unchanged, $s_i s_j \\to (-s_i)(-s_j) = s_i s_j$. Therefore, the energy $H(s)$ is invariant under a global spin flip. Consequently, the Boltzmann probability distribution $\\mathbb{P}(s)$ is also invariant.\n\nAt high temperatures (small $\\beta$), thermal fluctuations are dominant. The system explores its configuration space extensively, and no particular spin orientation is globally preferred. Due to the spin-flip symmetry, the thermal average of the magnetization, $\\langle m \\rangle = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_i \\langle s_i \\rangle$, must be zero. Any configuration with a net positive magnetization is just as probable as its flipped counterpart with a net negative magnetization. This corresponds to the paramagnetic (disordered) phase.\n\nAt low temperatures (large $\\beta$), the system seeks to minimize its energy. For a ferromagnetic coupling $J>0$, the energy is minimized when adjacent spins are aligned. This leads to two degenerate ground states: all spins up ($s_i = +1$ for all $i$), or all spins down ($s_i = -1$ for all $i$). In the thermodynamic limit ($N \\to \\infty$), the system will spontaneously select one of these two states, thereby breaking the global spin-flip symmetry. If the system chooses the all-up state, the magnetization $m$ will approach $+1$. If it chooses the all-down state, $m$ will approach $-1$. In either case, the magnitude of the magnetization is non-zero. This corresponds to the ferromagnetic (ordered) phase.\n\nSince the magnetization $m$ is zero in the symmetric, high-temperature phase and non-zero in the symmetry-broken, low-temperature phase, it serves as a valid order parameter for the ferromagnetic phase transition.\n\n**Derivation of the Mean-Field Self-Consistency Relation**\n\nWe apply the single-site mean-field approximation. The central idea is to analyze a single, representative spin, say $s_i$, and replace the instantaneous values of its neighboring spins with their thermal average. The Hamiltonian can be partitioned to isolate the terms involving $s_i$:\n$$\nH(s) = -s_i J \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}(i)} s_j + \\text{terms not involving } s_i\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{N}(i)$ is the set of neighbors of node $i$. In a $z$-regular network, the size of this set is $|\\mathcal{N}(i)| = z$.\n\nThe mean-field approximation consists of replacing the fluctuating neighbor spins $s_j$ with their average value, $s_j \\to \\langle s_j \\rangle$. The \"homogeneous closure assumption\" implies that we assume a translationally invariant system, so the average spin value is the same for all sites, i.e., $\\langle s_j \\rangle = m$ for all $j$. Here, we identify the ensemble average of a single spin with the macroscopic average magnetization per spin.\n\nApplying this approximation to the part of the Hamiltonian involving $s_i$, we obtain a single-site effective Hamiltonian, $H_i^{MF}$:\n$$\nH_i^{MF}(s_i) = -s_i J \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}(i)} m = -s_i J (z m)\n$$\nThis is equivalent to the Hamiltonian of a single spin $s_i$ in an effective magnetic field $h_{eff} = J z m$.\n\nThe thermal average of the spin $s_i$ can now be calculated using this effective Hamiltonian:\n$$\n\\langle s_i \\rangle = \\frac{\\sum_{s_i \\in \\{-1, +1\\}} s_i \\exp(-\\beta H_i^{MF}(s_i))}{\\sum_{s_i \\in \\{-1, +1\\}} \\exp(-\\beta H_i^{MF}(s_i))}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $H_i^{MF}$:\n$$\n\\langle s_i \\rangle = \\frac{(+1)\\exp(\\beta J z m) + (-1)\\exp(-\\beta J z m)}{\\exp(\\beta J z m) + \\exp(-\\beta J z m)}\n$$\nThis expression is the definition of the hyperbolic tangent function:\n$$\n\\langle s_i \\rangle = \\frac{\\sinh(\\beta J z m)}{\\cosh(\\beta J z m)} = \\tanh(\\beta J z m)\n$$\nThe self-consistency condition requires that the average spin value we calculated, $\\langle s_i \\rangle$, must be equal to the average value $m$ that we assumed in the first place. This yields the self-consistency relation:\n$$\nm = \\tanh(\\beta J z m)\n$$\n\n**Determination of the Critical Inverse Temperature $\\beta_c$**\n\nThe self-consistency equation $m = \\tanh(\\beta J z m)$ always has a trivial solution $m=0$, since $\\tanh(0)=0$. This solution corresponds to the disordered phase. A phase transition to an ordered state occurs when non-trivial solutions ($m \\ne 0$) first become possible.\n\nTo find the onset of these non-trivial solutions, we can analyze the behavior of the equation for infinitesimally small $m$. We Taylor expand the $\\tanh$ function around $0$: $\\tanh(x) \\approx x - \\frac{x^3}{3} + \\mathcal{O}(x^5)$.\nLet $x = \\beta J z m$. The self-consistency relation becomes:\n$$\nm \\approx (\\beta J z m) - \\frac{(\\beta J z m)^3}{3}\n$$\nRearranging the terms:\n$$\nm(1 - \\beta J z) \\approx -\\frac{1}{3}(\\beta J z)^3 m^3\n$$\nOne solution is $m=0$. For a non-zero solution, we can divide by $m$:\n$$\n1 - \\beta J z \\approx -\\frac{1}{3}(\\beta J z)^3 m^2\n$$\nSolving for $m^2$:\n$$\nm^2 \\approx \\frac{3(1 - \\beta J z)}{-(\\beta J z)^3} = \\frac{3(\\beta J z - 1)}{(\\beta J z)^3}\n$$\nFor a real, non-zero solution for $m$ to exist, we must have $m^2 > 0$. Since the denominator is positive (as $J>0, z>0, \\beta>0$), this requires the numerator to be positive:\n$$\n\\beta J z - 1 > 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\beta J z > 1\n$$\nThe critical point is the boundary of this condition, where the non-trivial solution emerges from $m=0$. This occurs precisely when $\\beta J z = 1$. Let $\\beta_c$ be the inverse temperature at this critical point.\n$$\n\\beta_c J z = 1\n$$\nThis can be seen graphically by plotting $y=m$ and $y=f(m)=\\tanh(\\beta J z m)$. A non-trivial solution exists if the slope of $f(m)$ at the origin is greater than the slope of $y=m$, which is $1$. The slope of $f(m)$ at $m=0$ is:\n$$\nf'(m) = \\frac{d}{dm}\\tanh(\\beta J z m) = \\beta J z \\cdot \\text{sech}^2(\\beta J z m)\n$$\n$$\nf'(0) = \\beta J z \\cdot \\text{sech}^2(0) = \\beta J z\n$$\nThe critical condition is $f'(0)=1$, which gives $\\beta_c J z = 1$.\n\nSolving for the critical inverse temperature $\\beta_c$:\n$$\n\\beta_c = \\frac{1}{J z}\n$$\nThis expression gives the critical inverse temperature in the mean-field approximation for the Ising model on a $z$-regular graph.",

Your correction must be derived from first principles of CTMC probability conservation and physically interpretable flux aggregation, not from ad hoc renormalization.\n\nWhich option correctly constructs a counterexample that exhibits violation of probability conservation under the naive averaging and provides a correct aggregation that fixes the violation?\n\nA. The macro row sums under $Q^{\\text{naive}}$ are $s_X := q^{\\text{naive}}_{XX} + q^{\\text{naive}}_{XY} = -5.25 + 0.75 = -4.5$ and $s_Y := q^{\\text{naive}}_{YY} + q^{\\text{naive}}_{YX} = -0.4 + 0.2 = -0.2$, so\n$$\\frac{d}{dt}\\big(p_X + p_Y\\big) = p_X s_X + p_Y s_Y = -4.5\\, p_X - 0.2\\, p_Y \\neq 0,$$\nviolating probability conservation unless $p_X = p_Y = 0$. A correct aggregation respects fluxes at the block boundary: the outflux from $X$ to $Y$ is $F_{X \\to Y}(t) = p_1(t) q_{13} + p_2(t) q_{23}$ and the influx from $Y$ to $X$ is $F_{Y \\to X}(t) = p_3(t)\\big(q_{31} + q_{32}\\big)$.

Because each micro row of $Q$ sums to $0$, any arithmetic averaging across micro rows produces a macro-generator with rows summing to $0$. Therefore $Q^{\\text{naive}}$ conserves probability. The correction is unnecessary; if desired, one may set $q^{\\text{corr}}_{XX} = q^{\\text{naive}}_{XX}$, $q^{\\text{corr}}_{XY} = q^{\\text{naive}}_{XY}$, etc., and probability conservation is guaranteed.\n\nC. The violation arises only because diagonals were not renormalized. Fix it by keeping $q^{\\text{naive}}_{XY} = 0.75$ and $q^{\\text{naive}}_{YX} = 0.2$, but set $q^{\\text{corr}}_{XX} = -q^{\\text{naive}}_{XY} = -0.75$ and $q^{\\text{corr}}_{YY} = -q^{\\text{naive}}_{YX} = -0.2$. This renormalization forces row sums to be zero and thus conserves probability, regardless of $p_1(t)$ and $p_2(t)$.\n\nD. Strong lumpability guarantees that the macro-dynamics is Markovian for all $t$. Since $Q$ is finite, use the stationary distribution weights $\\pi$ to define\n$$q^{\\pi}_{XY} := \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in X} \\pi_i \\sum_{j \\in Y} q_{ij}}{\\sum_{i \\in X} \\pi_i},\\quad q^{\\pi}_{YX} := \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in Y} \\pi_i \\sum_{j \\in X} q_{ij}}{\\sum_{i \\in Y} \\pi_i},$$\nand set $q^{\\pi}_{XX} = -q^{\\pi}_{XY}$, $q^{\\pi}_{YY} = -q^{\\pi}_{YX}$.

This requires the row sums of the generator matrix $Q^{\\text{naive}}$ to be zero. Let's compute these sums using the given values:\n-   Row $X$ sum: $s_X = q^{\\text{naive}}_{XX} + q^{\\text{naive}}_{XY} = -5.25 + 0.75 = -4.5$.\n-   Row $Y$ sum: $s_Y = q^{\\text{naive}}_{YX} + q^{\\text{naive}}_{YY} = 0.2 + (-0.4) = -0.2$.\nSince $s_X \\neq 0$ and $s_Y \\neq 0$, the time derivative of the total probability is:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\big(p_X(t) + p_Y(t)\\big) = -4.5 \\, p_X(t) - 0.2 \\, p_Y(t) $$\nThis expression is not identically zero. Therefore, the naive reductionist model does not conserve total probability and is inconsistent with the properties of a valid CTMC.\n\n**2. Principled Correction via Flux Aggregation**\n\nA principled derivation must start from the exact micro-dynamics and aggregate them correctly. The time evolution of the macrostate probability $p_X(t) = p_1(t) + p_2(t)$ is given by $\\frac{dp_X}{dt} = \\frac{dp_1}{dt} + \\frac{dp_2}{dt}$. Using the master equation $\\frac{dp}{dt} = pQ$:\n$$ \\frac{dp_1}{dt} = p_1 q_{11} + p_2 q_{21} + p_3 q_{31} $$\n$$ \\frac{dp_2}{dt} = p_1 q_{12} + p_2 q_{22} + p_3 q_{32} $$\nSumming these gives:\n$$ \\frac{dp_X}{dt} = p_1(q_{11} + q_{12}) + p_2(q_{21} + q_{22}) + p_3(q_{31} + q_{32}) $$\nUsing the property $q_{ii} = -\\sum_{j\\neq i} q_{ij}$, we have $q_{11} + q_{12} = -q_{13}$ and $q_{21} + q_{22} = -q_{23}$. Substituting these into the equation for $\\frac{dp_X}{dt}$:\n$$ \\frac{dp_X}{dt} = p_1(-q_{13}) + p_2(-q_{23}) + p_3(q_{31} + q_{32}) $$\n$$ \\frac{dp_X}{dt} = - \\big( p_1(t) q_{13} + p_2(t) q_{23} \\big) + p_3(t) \\big( q_{31} + q_{32} \\big) $$\nThe term $F_{X \\to Y}(t) = p_1(t) q_{13} + p_2(t) q_{23}$ represents the total probability flux from macrostate $X$ to macrostate $Y$. The term $F_{Y \\to X}(t) = p_3(t) (q_{31} + q_{32})$ is the total flux from $Y$ to $X$. So, $\\frac{dp_X}{dt} = -F_{X \\to Y}(t) + F_{Y \\to X}(t)$.\n\nFor $p_Y(t) = p_3(t)$, the dynamics are:\n$$ \\frac{dp_Y}{dt} = \\frac{dp_3}{dt} = p_1 q_{13} + p_2 q_{23} + p_3 q_{33} $$\nUsing $q_{33} = -(q_{31} + q_{32})$:\n$$ \\frac{dp_Y}{dt} = \\big(p_1 q_{13} + p_2 q_{23}\\big) - p_3(q_{31} + q_{32}) = F_{X \\to Y}(t) - F_{Y \\to X}(t) $$\nSumming the derivatives, $\\frac{dp_X}{dt} + \\frac{dp_Y}{dt} = 0$, confirms that this exact aggregation conserves probability.\n\nTo express this in the form of a macro-generator $Q^{\\text{agg}}$, we define effective transition rates $\\hat{q}_{XY}(t)$ and $\\hat{q}_{YX}(t)$ such that:\n$$ \\frac{dp_X}{dt} = -p_X(t) \\hat{q}_{XY}(t) + p_Y(t) \\hat{q}_{YX}(t) $$\nComparing this with our derived equation for $\\frac{dp_X}{dt}$:\n-   $p_Y(t) \\hat{q}_{YX}(t) = F_{Y \\to X}(t) = p_Y(t) (q_{31} + q_{32})$. This implies $\\hat{q}_{YX}(t) = q_{31} + q_{32} = 0.2 + 0.2 = 0.4$. This rate is constant because macrostate $Y$ contains only a single microstate.\n-   $-p_X(t) \\hat{q}_{XY}(t) = -F_{X \\to Y}(t) = -(p_1(t) q_{13} + p_2(t) q_{23})$. This implies $\\hat{q}_{XY}(t) = \\frac{p_1(t) q_{13} + p_2(t) q_{23}}{p_X(t)} = \\frac{1 \\cdot p_1(t) + 0.5 \\cdot p_2(t)}{p_1(t) + p_2(t)}$.\n\nThis effective rate $\\hat{q}_{XY}(t)$ is an occupancy-weighted average of the underlying micro-rates. It depends on the internal distribution of probability within macrostate $X$, and is therefore generally time-dependent. The aggregated process is not a time-homogeneous CTMC unless the condition for strong lumpability is met (i.e., $\\sum_{j \\in Y} q_{ij}$ is constant for all $i \\in X$). Here, $q_{13}=1$ and $q_{23}=0.5$, so the condition is not met.\n\nThe corrected macro-generator $Q^{\\text{agg}}(t)$ would have entries:\n$q^{\\text{agg}}_{XY}(t) = \\hat{q}_{XY}(t)$, $q^{\\text{agg}}_{YX}(t) = \\hat{q}_{YX}(t) = 0.4$, and to ensure zero row sums, $q^{\\text{agg}}_{XX}(t) = -\\hat{q}_{XY}(t)$ and $q^{\\text{agg}}_{YY}(t) = -\\hat{q}_{YX}(t) = -0.4$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.** This option correctly calculates the row sums of $Q^{\\text{naive}}$ as $s_X = -4.5$ and $s_Y = -0.2$, and correctly deduces that the dynamics $\\frac{d}{dt}(p_X + p_Y) = -4.5 p_X - 0.2 p_Y$ violates probability conservation. It then correctly identifies the fluxes $F_{X \\to Y}(t)$ and $F_{Y \\to X}(t)$ and derives the instantaneous, occupancy-weighted rates $\\hat{q}_{XY}(t)$ and $\\hat{q}_{YX}(t)$. The derived expression for $\\hat{q}_{XY}(t) = \\frac{p_1(t) \\cdot 1 + p_2(t) \\cdot 0.5}{p_X(t)}$ and the value $\\hat{q}_{YX}(t) = 0.4$ are accurate. Finally, it constructs a valid, probability-conserving (though time-dependent) macro-dynamic based on these correctly derived rates. Every part of this option is consistent with our derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B.** This option claims that arithmetic averaging of rows that sum to zero must produce rows that sum to zero. This is mathematically false, as demonstrated by the calculation $s_X = -4.5 \\neq 0$ and $s_Y = -0.2 \\neq 0$. The reasoning fails because the averaging procedure mixes rates for transitions within a macrostate with rates for transitions between macrostates in a way that breaks the balance required for probability conservation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C.** This option proposes an *ad hoc* renormalization. It keeps the incorrectly calculated off-diagonal rates from the naive method ($q^{\\text{naive}}_{XY}=0.75$, $q^{\\text{naive}}_{YX}=0.2$) and forces the diagonal entries to make the row sums zero. While this does create a mathematically valid generator matrix, it is not derived from first principles of flux aggregation. The problem explicitly forbids such a repair. The rates themselves do not represent the true aggregated fluxes; for instance, the correct rate from $Y$ to $X$ is $0.4$, not $0.2$, and the rate from $X$ to $Y$ is time-dependent, not a constant $0.75$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D.** This option proposes an aggregation based on weighting by the stationary distribution $\\pi$. This is a known approximation technique that yields a time-homogeneous Markovian approximation of the macro-dynamics, which is exact only at stationarity or under a quasi-stationary assumption. The option's claim that this construction \"exactly reproduces the micro fluxes for all $t$\" is false. The exact flux depends on the instantaneous probabilities $p_i(t)$, which are generally not proportional to the stationary probabilities $\\pi_i$ during the transient phase of the dynamics.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",

            "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation and found to be valid as it represents a standard, well-posed problem in statistical mechanics that is scientifically grounded and internally consistent.\n\nWe begin by deriving the Renormalization Group (RG) transformation for the one-dimensional Ising model under decimation. The partition function is given by\n$$\nZ = \\sum_{\\{s_{i}\\}} \\exp\\left(K \\sum_{i=1}^{N} s_{i} s_{i+1}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $K = \\beta J$ is the dimensionless coupling, and $s_{N+1} \\equiv s_{1}$ due to periodic boundary conditions. We assume $N$ is an even integer, $N=2M$, so that the decimation procedure is well-defined on a periodic chain. Decimation involves summing over the odd-indexed spins ($s_1, s_3, \\dots, s_{2M-1}$) to find an effective theory for the even-indexed spins ($s_2, s_4, \\dots, s_{2M}$). Let us denote the even-indexed spins as a new set of spins $s'_j \\equiv s_{2j}$ for $j=1, \\dots, M$.\n\nWe can separate the sum over all spins into a sum over the even spins followed by a sum over the odd spins:\n$$\nZ = \\sum_{\\{s'_{\\text{even}}\\}} \\sum_{\\{s_{\\text{odd}}\\}} \\exp\\left(K \\sum_{i=1}^{N} s_{i} s_{i+1}\\right)\n$$\nThe term in the exponent involves interaction terms. Each odd-indexed spin $s_{2j-1}$ interacts only with its two even-indexed neighbors, $s_{2j-2}$ and $s_{2j}$. Thus, the total sum in the exponent can be regrouped as:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{N} s_{i} s_{i+1} = \\sum_{j=1}^{M} (s_{2j-1}s_{2j} + s_{2j}s_{2j+1}) \\quad \\text{This is incorrect, let's be more careful.}\n$$\nThe sum is $\\sum_{i=1}^{2M} s_i s_{i+1}$. A spin $s_k$ is connected to $s_{k-1}$ and $s_{k+1}$. The odd spin $s_{2j-1}$ is connected to $s_{2j-2}$ and $s_{2j}$. The partition function's exponential term can be factorized according to the odd spins:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(K \\sum_{i=1}^{N} s_{i} s_{i+1}\\right) = \\exp\\left(K \\sum_{j=1}^{M} (s_{2j-2}s_{2j-1} + s_{2j-1}s_{2j})\\right) = \\prod_{j=1}^{M} \\exp\\left(K s_{2j-1}(s_{2j-2} + s_{2j})\\right)\n$$\nwhere we have used the periodic boundary condition $s_0 \\equiv s_N = s_{2M}$.\nThe partition function becomes:\n$$\nZ = \\sum_{\\{s'_{j}\\}} \\sum_{\\{s_{2j-1}\\}} \\prod_{j=1}^{M} \\exp\\left(K s_{2j-1}(s'_{j-1} + s'_{j})\\right)\n$$\nwhere $s'_j = s_{2j}$ and $s'_0 \\equiv s'_{M}$. The sum over the odd spins can now be performed independently for each odd spin:\n$$\nZ = \\sum_{\\{s'_{j}\\}} \\prod_{j=1}^{M} \\left[ \\sum_{s_{2j-1} \\in \\{-1,1\\}} \\exp\\left(K s_{2j-1}(s'_{j-1} + s'_{j})\\right) \\right]\n$$\nLet's evaluate the inner sum for a generic odd spin $s_{\\text{odd}}$ between two generic even spins $s'_a$ and $s'_b$:\n$$\n\\sum_{s_{\\text{odd}} \\in \\{-1,1\\}} \\exp\\left(K s_{\\text{odd}}(s'_a + s'_b)\\right) = \\exp\\left(K(s'_a + s'_b)\\right) + \\exp\\left(-K(s'_a + s'_b)\\right) = 2 \\cosh\\left(K(s'_a + s'_b)\\right)\n$$\nTo obtain an effective Ising model, we need to express this result in the form $C \\exp(K' s'_a s'_b)$ for some new coupling $K'$ and a spin-configuration-independent constant $C$. We can determine $C$ and $K'$ by considering the two possible cases for the product $s'_a s'_b$:\nCase 1: $s'_a s'_b = 1$. This occurs when $s'_a=s'_b=1$ or $s'_a=s'_b=-1$. Then $s'_a+s'_b = \\pm 2$.\nThe sum is $2 \\cosh(K(\\pm 2)) = 2 \\cosh(2K)$. This must be equal to $C \\exp(K' \\cdot 1) = C \\exp(K')$.\nCase 2: $s'_a s'_b = -1$. This occurs when $s'_a = -s'_b$. Then $s'_a+s'_b = 0$.\nThe sum is $2 \\cosh(K \\cdot 0) = 2 \\cosh(0) = 2$. This must be equal to $C \\exp(K' \\cdot (-1)) = C \\exp(-K')$.\nWe have a system of two equations:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nC \\exp(K') = 2 \\cosh(2K) \\\\\nC \\exp(-K') = 2\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nDividing the first equation by the second gives:\n$$\n\\frac{C \\exp(K')}{C \\exp(-K')} = \\frac{2 \\cosh(2K)}{2} \\implies \\exp(2K') = \\cosh(2K)\n$$\nSolving for $K'$ yields the RG transformation:\n$$\nK' = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln(\\cosh(2K))\n$$\nThe constant $C$ can be found by multiplying the two equations: $C^2 = 4 \\cosh(2K)$, so $C = 2\\sqrt{\\cosh(2K)}$. The partition function for the new system of $M$ spins is:\n$$\nZ = \\sum_{\\{s'_{j}\\}} \\prod_{j=1}^{M} C \\exp(K' s'_{j-1}s'_j) = C^M \\sum_{\\{s'_{j}\\}} \\exp\\left(K' \\sum_{j=1}^{M} s'_{j-1}s'_j\\right)\n$$\nThis is the partition function for an Ising model of $M=N/2$ spins with coupling $K'$, multiplied by a configuration-independent constant $C^M$.\n\nNext, we analyze the fixed points of this transformation, $f(K) = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(\\cosh(2K))$. A fixed point $K^*$ satisfies $K^* = f(K^*)$:\n$$\nK^* = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(\\cosh(2K^*)) \\implies 2K^* = \\ln(\\cosh(2K^*)) \\implies \\exp(2K^*) = \\cosh(2K^*)\n$$\nUsing the definition $\\cosh(x) = (\\exp(x) + \\exp(-x))/2$, we get:\n$$\n\\exp(2K^*) = \\frac{\\exp(2K^*) + \\exp(-2K^*)}{2} \\implies 2\\exp(2K^*) = \\exp(2K^*) + \\exp(-2K^*)\n$$\n$$\n\\exp(2K^*) = \\exp(-2K^*) \\implies \\exp(4K^*) = 1\n$$\nFor a real coupling $K$, the only solution is $4K^*=0$, so $K^*=0$. This is the high-temperature (or disordered) fixed point ($T \\to \\infty$). Another fixed point exists at $K^* \\to \\infty$, the zero-temperature (or ordered) fixed point.\nTo analyze stability, we compute the derivative of the transformation:\n$$\n\\frac{dK'}{dK} = \\frac{d}{dK}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\ln(\\cosh(2K))\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{1}{\\cosh(2K)} (2\\sinh(2K)) = \\tanh(2K)\n$$\nAt the fixed point $K^*=0$, the stability is given by $\\lambda = \\frac{dK'}{dK}|_{K^*=0} = \\tanh(0) = 0$. Since $|\\lambda| < 1$, the fixed point $K^*=0$ is stable (attractive).\nFor any initial coupling $K > 0$, we have $K' = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(\\cosh(2K)) < \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(\\exp(2K))=K$. Thus, under iteration, any finite $K$ flows towards the stable fixed point $K^*=0$. This means that at large length scales, the system always appears to be at infinite temperature (completely disordered).\nA finite-temperature phase transition would require an unstable fixed point $K^*_c \\in (0, \\infty)$, which does not exist for this transformation. The absence of such a fixed point indicates that there is no finite-temperature phase transition in the one-dimensional Ising model.\n\nWe now relate this to the scaling of the correlation length $\\xi$. The given correlation function is $\\langle s_0 s_r \\rangle = (\\tanh K)^r$. The standard form is $\\langle s_0 s_r \\rangle \\propto \\exp(-r/\\xi)$. By comparison, we can write $(\\tanh K)^r = \\exp(r \\ln(\\tanh K)) = \\exp(-r/(-1/\\ln(\\tanh K)))$. Thus, the correlation length is:\n$$\n\\xi(K) = -\\frac{1}{\\ln(\\tanh K)}\n$$\nSince $K>0$, we have $0 < \\tanh K < 1$, so $\\ln(\\tanh K) < 0$, and $\\xi(K) > 0$.\nUnder the RG decimation, the length scale is rescaled by a factor of $b=2$. A physical length must be invariant, so $\\xi_{\\text{phys}} = \\xi(K) a = \\xi'(K') a'$, where $a$ is the old lattice spacing and $a'=2a$ is the new one. This implies the scaling relation $\\xi'(K') = \\xi(K)/2$. Let's verify this. We need to show that\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{\\ln(\\tanh(K'))} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\ln(\\tanh K)}\\right) \\iff \\ln(\\tanh(K')) = 2\\ln(\\tanh K) \\iff \\tanh(K') = (\\tanh K)^2\n$$\nWe use the identity $\\tanh(x/2) = (\\cosh x - 1)/\\sinh x$. With $K' = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(\\cosh(2K))$, we have:\n$$\n\\tanh(K') = \\tanh\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\ln(\\cosh(2K))\\right) = \\frac{\\cosh(\\ln(\\cosh(2K))) - 1}{\\sinh(\\ln(\\cosh(2K)))}\n$$\nUsing $\\cosh(\\ln y) = (y+1/y)/2$ and $\\sinh(\\ln y) = (y-1/y)/2$ with $y=\\cosh(2K)$:\n$$\n\\tanh(K') = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}(\\cosh(2K)+\\frac{1}{\\cosh(2K)})-1}{\\frac{1}{2}(\\cosh(2K)-\\frac{1}{\\cosh(2K)})} = \\frac{\\cosh^2(2K)+1-2\\cosh(2K)}{\\cosh^2(2K)-1} = \\frac{(\\cosh(2K)-1)^2}{\\sinh^2(2K)} = \\left(\\frac{\\cosh(2K)-1}{\\sinh(2K)}\\right)^2\n$$\nUsing the half-angle identity $\\tanh K = (\\cosh(2K)-1)/\\sinh(2K)$, we find $\\tanh(K') = (\\tanh K)^2$. The scaling relation is thus verified. The RG flow toward $K=0$ implies that the system becomes progressively more disordered at larger scales. This is consistent with the correlation length $\\xi$ decreasing upon rescaling, meaning correlations decay faster relative to the new, larger lattice spacing. Macroscopic order corresponds to an infinite correlation length, $\\xi \\to \\infty$, which occurs only as $\\tanh K \\to 1$, i.e., at $K \\to \\infty$ ($T=0$). At any finite temperature, $\\xi$ is finite, confirming the absence of long-range order.\n\nFinally, we interpret these findings in the context of reductionism versus holism. A purely reductionist view would focus on the microscopic constituents and their pairwise interactions. The RG procedure represents a holistic approach. By coarse-graining—systematically removing degrees of freedom (the odd spins)—we examine the system at a larger scale. The crucial insight is that the physics is not lost but is captured in a renormalized parameter, the effective coupling $K'$. The transformation $K \\mapsto K'$ shows how the influence of the microscopic details propagates to macroscopic scales. The form of the interactions remains the same (an Ising model), but their effective strength changes. The RG flow diagram is an emergent property of the system as a whole. It holistically demonstrates that fluctuations at all scales in one dimension are sufficient to destroy any potential long-range order at any temperature $T>0$. The absence of a finite-temperature phase transition is a macroscopic feature revealed by this holistic, scale-dependent analysis, a conclusion that is not immediately obvious from a purely reductionist inspection of the Hamiltonian.",
