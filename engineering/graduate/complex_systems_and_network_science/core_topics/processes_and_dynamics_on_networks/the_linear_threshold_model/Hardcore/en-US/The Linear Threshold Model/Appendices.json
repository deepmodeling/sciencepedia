Seeding node $d$ produces a global cascade that activates all nodes, while seeding node $h$ does not, even though $k_d = k_h$, so degree centrality fails to predict single-seed influence under the heterogeneous thresholds.**\n    Our simulation shows $S(d)=8$ (global) and $S(h)=3$ (not global). Both nodes have the same degree, $k_d = k_h = 5$. This statement is correct.\n\n*   **B. The final cascade size $S(i)$ from any single-node seed $i$ is strictly increasing in $k_i$ (higher degree always implies a larger cascade).**\n    This is false. For example, $k_h=5 > k_d=5$ is not true. Let's find another counterexample. $k_f=2 > k_a=1$. A quick simulation shows that seeding $a$ activates only itself, so $S(a)=1$. Seeding $f$ also activates only itself (its neighbors $c$ and $d$ have thresholds $0.5$ and $0.6$, needing more than one active neighbor), so $S(f)=1$. Since $S(f)$ is not strictly greater than $S(a)$, the statement is false.\n\n*   **C. Seeding node $h$ yields the largest cascade among all single-node seeds because $k_h$ is maximal.**\n    This is false. $S(h)=3$, while $S(d)=8$, which is larger.\n\n*   **D. Under the specified thresholds, nodes with identical degree centrality always produce identical cascade sizes when seeded.**\n    This is false. A direct counterexample is nodes $h$ and $d$. They have identical degree ($k_h=k_d=5$) but produce different cascade sizes ($S(h)=3$ vs. $S(d)=8$).\n\nThe only correct statement is A.",

The total influence it receives is $y_{0,0} + y_{1,0} = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1$.\n-   The activation constraint for node 2 is $y_{0,0} + y_{1,0} \\ge k_2 z_{2,1} \\implies 1 \\ge 2z_{2,1}$, which means $z_{2,1} \\le 0.5$. To maximize the objective, the solver will set $z_{2,1}=0.5$.\n-   The activity of node 2 at $t=1$ is $y_{2,1} \\approx y_{2,0} + z_{2,1} = 0 + 0.5 = 0.5$.\n-   By symmetry, nodes 3 and 4 also achieve a final activity of $0.5$.\n-   The final activity of the seeded nodes will be at least their initial activity: $y_{0,1} \\ge 0.5$ and $y_{1,1} \\ge 0.5$.\n-   The total objective value is $\\sum y_{v,1} = y_{0,1} + y_{1,1} + y_{2,1} + y_{3,1} + y_{4,1} \\approx 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 2.5$.\n**LP Optimum = 2.5**\n\n**Integrality Gap**: $\\text{gap} = \\frac{2.5}{1.0} = 2.5$\n\n---\n\n### **Test Case B**\n-   Same as A, but thresholds are $k_2=1, k_3=1, k_4=1$.\n-   Budget: $B=1$.\n\n**ILP Solution:**\n-   If we seed node 0, it becomes active. Nodes $\\{2,3,4\\}$ each receive influence from 1 active node. Since their threshold is now $k=1$, they all activate. The final active set is $\\{0,2,3,4\\}$. Total active nodes: 4.\n-   Seeding node 1 gives the same result. Total active nodes: 4.\n-   Seeding node 2, 3, or 4 results in 1 active node.\nThe maximum number of active nodes is 4.\n**ILP Optimum = 4.0**\n\n**LP Relaxation Solution:**\nThe integer solution of seeding node 0 (setting $x_0=1$) results in an objective value of 4. Since the total number of nodes that can possibly be activated by seeding 0 or 1 is 4, the LP relaxation cannot find a better solution. The optimal value is achieved by the integer solution.\n**LP Optimum = 4.0**\n\n**Integrality Gap**: $\\text{gap} = \\frac{4.0}{4.0} = 1.0$\n\n---\n\n### **Test Case C**\n-   Nodes: $\\{0,1,2\\}$ in a complete directed graph.\n-   Thresholds: $k_0=2, k_1=2, k_2=2$.\n-   Budget: $B=1$.\n\n**ILP Solution:**\n-   If we seed node 0, it is active. Its neighbors are 1 and 2.\n    -   Node 1's in-neighbors are $\\{0,2\\}$. Only one (node 0) is active. Since $1  k_1=2$, node 1 does not activate.\n    -   Node 2's in-neighbors are $\\{0,1\\}$. Only one (node 0) is active. Since $1  k_2=2$, node 2 does not activate.\n-   The cascade stops immediately. Total active nodes: 1. By symmetry, seeding any single node gives a total of 1 active node.\n**ILP Optimum = 1.0**\n\n**LP Relaxation Solution:**\nLet's try a fractional seeding: $x_0=0.5, x_1=0.5, x_2=0$. This satisfies the budget $0.5+0.5 \\le 1$.\n-   Initial activities: $y_{0,0}=0.5, y_{1,0}=0.5, y_{2,0}=0$.\n-   For node 0 (in-neighbors $\\{1,2\\}$): influence is $y_{1,0}+y_{2,0}=0.5$. Constraint: $0.5 \\ge 2z_{0,1} \\implies z_{0,1} \\le 0.25$.\n-   For node 1 (in-neighbors $\\{0,2\\}$): influence is $y_{0,0}+y_{2,0}=0.5$. Constraint: $0.5 \\ge 2z_{1,1} \\implies z_{1,1} \\le 0.25$.\n-   For node 2 (in-neighbors $\\{0,1\\}$): influence is $y_{0,0}+y_{1,0}=1.0$. Constraint: $1.0 \\ge 2z_{2,1} \\implies z_{2,1} \\le 0.5$.\n-   The objective is to maximize $\\sum y_{v,1} \\approx (y_{0,0}+z_{0,1}) + (y_{1,0}+z_{1,1}) + (y_{2,0}+z_{2,1})$.\n-   Plugging in max values for $z$: $(0.5+0.25) + (0.5+0.25) + (0+0.5) = 0.75 + 0.75 + 0.5 = 2.0$.\nThis is the optimal fractional solution.\n**LP Optimum = 2.0**\n\n**Integrality Gap**: $\\text{gap} = \\frac{2.0}{1.0} = 2.0$\n\n### **Final Results**\n-   **Case A**: ILP=1.0, LP=2.5, Gap=2.5\n-   **Case B**: ILP=4.0, LP=4.0, Gap=1.0\n-   **Case C**: ILP=1.0, LP=2.0, Gap=2.0",
