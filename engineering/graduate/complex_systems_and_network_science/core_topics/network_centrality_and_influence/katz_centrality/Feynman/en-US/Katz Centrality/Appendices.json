Since the problem requires $\\alpha^{\\star}  0$, the unique solution is $\\alpha^{\\star} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n\n**4. Structural Explanation for Ranking Difference**\nThe ranking of nodes $1$ and $5$ by degree centrality is determined by the number of length-$1$ walks terminating at each node. As shown by $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{1}$, node $5$ receives three length-$1$ walks (from nodes $2$, $3$, $4$) while node $1$ receives only one (from node $5$). This gives node $5$ a higher degree centrality.\n\nThe attenuated walk-based centrality accounts for longer paths. The crucial difference arises from the second-order walk contributions, which are captured by the term $\\alpha^{2}\\mathbf{A}^{2}\\mathbf{1}$. From our calculation, the vector of total length-$2$ walks is $\\mathbf{A}^{2}\\mathbf{1}=(3, 0, 0, 0, 0)^{T}$. This shows that there are three walks of length $2$ that terminate at node $1$, but there are zero walks of length $2$ that terminate at node $5$.\n\nStructurally, node $1$ acts as a \"second-order\" destination for the nodes that feed into node $5$. The three distinct walks of length $2$ ending at node $1$ are $2 \\to 5 \\to 1$, $3 \\to 5 \\to 1$, and $4 \\to 5 \\to 1$. These walks contribute a term $3\\alpha^{2}$ to the centrality of node $1$. In contrast, node $5$ receives its a high number of length-$1$ walks from nodes $2, 3, 4$, which are source nodes (in-degree of $0$). Consequently, there are no paths of length $2$ leading into node $5$.\n\nWhile node $5$ is a more important local hub (higher in-degree), node $1$ aggregates influence from two-step neighbors. The walk-based centrality captures this non-local influence. The term $3\\alpha^2$ boosts the centrality of node $1$, while the centrality of node $5$ gets no such second-order bonus. For a sufficiently large value of $\\alpha$ (specifically, for $\\alpha  \\frac{2}{3}$), this second-order effect for node $1$ is strong enough to overcome the first-order advantage of node $5$, leading to a reversal in their centrality ranking compared to simple in-degree.",

In a directed network, one may quantify two distinct notions of importance:\n- receiver importance, associated with the accumulation of attenuated incoming walks terminating at a node, and\n- sender importance, associated with the accumulation of attenuated outgoing walks originating from a node.\nStarting from the walk-counting interpretation of attenuated path contributions and linear superposition, and without relying on any pre-given shortcut formulas, derive the linear systems that uniquely determine the receiver and sender importance vectors for this network as functions of $A$ and $\\alpha$. Then, solve these systems exactly for $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{5}$ to obtain both the receiver and sender importance vectors. Finally, rank the nodes from highest to lowest under each notion, and explain why the rankings differ due to the asymmetric orientation of edges in $A$. For the final numerical submission, provide the eight-tuple comprising, in order, the four receiver importance scores $(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, x_{4})$ followed by the four sender importance scores $(y_{1}, y_{2}, y_{3}, y_{4})$, expressed exactly.",
            "solution": "We are asked to derive and solve the linear systems for receiver and sender Katz centrality. The problem statement uses the convention that $A_{ij}=1$ for an edge from $i$ to $j$. Each node has a baseline exogenous score of $1$.\n\nFirst, we derive the linear system for the receiver importance vector, $\\mathbf{x}$. The receiver importance of a node $i$, $x_i$, is its baseline score plus the attenuated contributions of all incoming walks. A walk of length $\\ell$ from any node $j$ ending at node $i$ contributes $\\alpha^\\ell$. The total number of walks of length $\\ell$ ending at node $i$ from all possible starting nodes is the $i$-th component of $(A^\\ell)^T \\mathbf{1}$.\nThus, the score vector for all nodes is:\n$$\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{1} + \\sum_{\\ell=1}^{\\infty} \\alpha^{\\ell} (A^T)^{\\ell} \\mathbf{1} = \\left(\\sum_{\\ell=0}^{\\infty} (\\alpha A^T)^{\\ell}\\right) \\mathbf{1}$$\nThis is a geometric series of matrices, so $\\mathbf{x} = (I - \\alpha A^T)^{-1} \\mathbf{1}$. This corresponds to the linear system that determines the receiver importance vector $\\mathbf{x}$:\n$$(I - \\alpha A^T) \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{1}$$\n\nSecond, we derive the linear system for the sender importance vector, $\\mathbf{y}$. The sender importance of a node $i$, $y_i$, is its baseline score plus the attenuated contributions of all outgoing walks. The total number of walks of length $\\ell$ starting from node $i$ to all possible ending nodes is the $i$-th component of $A^\\ell \\mathbf{1}$.\nThe score vector is:\n$$\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{1} + \\sum_{\\ell=1}^{\\infty} \\alpha^{\\ell} A^{\\ell} \\mathbf{1} = \\left(\\sum_{\\ell=0}^{\\infty} (\\alpha A)^{\\ell}\\right) \\mathbf{1}$$\nThis gives $\\mathbf{y} = (I - \\alpha A)^{-1} \\mathbf{1}$, which corresponds to the linear system:\n$$(I - \\alpha A) \\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{1}$$\n\nNow, we solve these systems for the given network with $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  1  1 \\\\ 0  0  0  1 \\\\ 0  1  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\alpha = 1/5$.\n\nFor the receiver importance vector $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)^T$:\nThe system is $(I - \\frac{1}{5} A^T) \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{1}$.\n$$A^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  0  0 \\\\ 1  0  0  1 \\\\ 1  1  0  0 \\\\ 0  1  1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$I - \\frac{1}{5}A^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0  0 \\\\ -1/5  1  0  -1/5 \\\\ -1/5  -1/5  1  0 \\\\ 0  -1/5  -1/5  1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe system of equations is:\n$x_1 = 1$\n$-\\frac{1}{5}x_1 + x_2 - \\frac{1}{5}x_4 = 1$\n$-\\frac{1}{5}x_1 - \\frac{1}{5}x_2 + x_3 = 1$\n$-\\frac{1}{5}x_2 - \\frac{1}{5}x_3 + x_4 = 1$\nFrom the first equation, $x_1 = 1$.\nSubstituting $x_1=1$ into the third equation: $-\\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{1}{5}x_2 + x_3 = 1 \\implies x_3 = \\frac{6}{5} + \\frac{1}{5}x_2$.\nSubstituting $x_1=1$ into the second equation: $-\\frac{1}{5} + x_2 - \\frac{1}{5}x_4 = 1 \\implies x_2 - \\frac{1}{5}x_4 = \\frac{6}{5}$.\nFrom the fourth equation, we have $x_4 = 1 + \\frac{1}{5}x_2 + \\frac{1}{5}x_3$.\nSubstituting the expression for $x_3$ into this equation for $x_4$:\n$x_4 = 1 + \\frac{1}{5}x_2 + \\frac{1}{5}(\\frac{6}{5} + \\frac{1}{5}x_2) = 1 + \\frac{1}{5}x_2 + \\frac{6}{25} + \\frac{1}{25}x_2 = \\frac{31}{25} + \\frac{6}{25}x_2$.\nNow substitute this back into the equation for $x_2$:\n$x_2 - \\frac{1}{5}(\\frac{31}{25} + \\frac{6}{25}x_2) = \\frac{6}{5} \\implies x_2 - \\frac{31}{125} - \\frac{6}{125}x_2 = \\frac{6}{5}$\n$x_2(1 - \\frac{6}{125}) = \\frac{6}{5} + \\frac{31}{125} \\implies \\frac{119}{125}x_2 = \\frac{150+31}{125} = \\frac{181}{125} \\implies x_2 = \\frac{181}{119}$.\nNow we find the other components:\n$x_1 = 1 = \\frac{119}{119}$.\n$x_3 = \\frac{6}{5} + \\frac{1}{5}x_2 = \\frac{6}{5} + \\frac{1}{5}\\left(\\frac{181}{119}\\right) = \\frac{6 \\cdot 119 + 181}{5 \\cdot 119} = \\frac{714+181}{595} = \\frac{895}{595} = \\frac{179}{119}$.\n$x_4 = \\frac{31}{25} + \\frac{6}{25}x_2 = \\frac{31}{25} + \\frac{6}{25}\\left(\\frac{181}{119}\\right) = \\frac{31 \\cdot 119 + 6 \\cdot 181}{25 \\cdot 119} = \\frac{3689+1086}{2975} = \\frac{4775}{2975} = \\frac{191}{119}$.\nSo, $\\mathbf{x} = \\frac{1}{119} \\begin{pmatrix} 119 \\\\ 181 \\\\ 179 \\\\ 191 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nFor the sender importance vector $\\mathbf{y} = (y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4)^T$:\nThe system is $(I - \\frac{1}{5} A) \\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{1}$.\n$$I - \\frac{1}{5}A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -1/5  -1/5  0 \\\\ 0  1  -1/5  -1/5 \\\\ 0  0  1  -1/5 \\\\ 0  -1/5  0  1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe system of equations is:\n$y_1 - \\frac{1}{5}y_2 - \\frac{1}{5}y_3 = 1$\n$y_2 - \\frac{1}{5}y_3 - \\frac{1}{5}y_4 = 1$\n$y_3 - \\frac{1}{5}y_4 = 1$\n$-\\frac{1}{5}y_2 + y_4 = 1$\nFrom the third equation, $y_3 = 1 + \\frac{1}{5}y_4$.\nFrom the fourth equation, $y_2 = 5(y_4 - 1)$.\nSubstitute $y_2$ and $y_3$ into the second equation:\n$5(y_4-1) - \\frac{1}{5}(1+\\frac{1}{5}y_4) - \\frac{1}{5}y_4 = 1$\n$5y_4 - 5 - \\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{1}{25}y_4 - \\frac{1}{5}y_4 = 1$\n$y_4(5 - \\frac{1}{25} - \\frac{5}{25}) = 1 + 5 + \\frac{1}{5} \\implies \\frac{119}{25}y_4 = \\frac{31}{5}$\n$y_4 = \\frac{31}{5} \\frac{25}{119} = \\frac{155}{119}$.\nNow we find the other components:\n$y_3 = 1 + \\frac{1}{5}y_4 = 1 + \\frac{1}{5}\\left(\\frac{155}{119}\\right) = 1 + \\frac{31}{119} = \\frac{150}{119}$.\n$y_2 = 5(y_4-1) = 5\\left(\\frac{155}{119}-1\\right) = 5\\left(\\frac{36}{119}\\right) = \\frac{180}{119}$.\n$y_1 = 1 + \\frac{1}{5}y_2 + \\frac{1}{5}y_3 = 1 + \\frac{1}{5}\\left(\\frac{180}{119}\\right) + \\frac{1}{5}\\left(\\frac{150}{119}\\right) = 1 + \\frac{36}{119} + \\frac{30}{119} = \\frac{119+36+30}{119} = \\frac{185}{119}$.\nSo, $\\mathbf{y} = \\frac{1}{119} \\begin{pmatrix} 185 \\\\ 180 \\\\ 150 \\\\ 155 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nFinally, we rank the nodes and explain the differences.\nReceiver importance ranking (from highest to lowest):\nNode 4 ($191/119$), Node 2 ($181/119$), Node 3 ($179/119$), Node 1 ($119/119$).\nThis ranking reflects a node's ability to accumulate influence. Node 1 has an in-degree of $0$, so its score is just its baseline value of $1$. Node 4 is the most important receiver because it is targeted by nodes 2 and 3, both of which are themselves significant receivers of influence. The recursive equations $x_i = 1 + \\alpha \\sum_j A_{ji} x_j$ show that a node's score is boosted by having important nodes linking to it. Node 4 is pointed to by nodes 2 and 3. Node 2 is pointed to by nodes 1 and 4. Node 3 is pointed to by nodes 1 and 2. Since node 4 benefits from multiple incoming links from influential nodes, it becomes the top receiver.\n\nSender importance ranking (from highest to lowest):\nNode 1 ($185/119$), Node 2 ($180/119$), Node 4 ($155/119$), Node 3 ($150/119$).\nThis ranking reflects a node's ability to broadcast influence. The recursive equations are $y_i = 1 + \\alpha \\sum_j A_{ij} y_j$. Node 1 is the top sender. It is a pure source with an out-degree of $2$, initiating influence that can reach all other nodes in the network. Node 2 is also a strong sender with out-degree $2$. However, Node 1 points to more influential senders (nodes 2 and 3) than Node 2 does (nodes 3 and 4), as $y_2+y_3  y_3+y_4$. Node 3 is the worst sender; it has an out-degree of only $1$. Node 4 has a higher score than Node 3 because it points to Node 2, which is a highly influential sender, and participates in the $2 \\to 4 \\to 2$ influence loop.\n\nThe rankings differ because the network is directed ($A \\neq A^T$). Receiver scores depend on the incoming link structure (governed by $A^T$), while sender scores depend on the outgoing link structure (governed by $A$). Node 1, with no incoming links, is the worst receiver but the best sender. Conversely, nodes like 4 accumulate influence well but are less effective at initiating it compared to nodes 1 and 2.",
