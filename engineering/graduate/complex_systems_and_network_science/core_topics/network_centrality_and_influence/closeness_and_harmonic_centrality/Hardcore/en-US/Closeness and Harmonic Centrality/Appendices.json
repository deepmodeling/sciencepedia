            "solution": "The problem requires the analysis of closeness and harmonic centrality for a specific tree graph. The validation of the problem statement has confirmed its scientific soundness, consistency, and well-posed nature. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nFirst, let's formally describe the graph $G=(V, E)$. The set of vertices is $V = \\{v_0, v_1, \\dots, v_9\\} \\cup \\{w_1, w_2, w_3\\}$. The total number of vertices is $n = 13$. The edges are $E = \\{\\{v_i, v_{i+1}\\} | i = 0, \\dots, 8\\} \\cup \\{\\{v_0, w_j\\} | j=1, 2, 3\\}$. This is a tree, as it is connected and has $12 = n-1$ edges. The distance $d(u,v)$ between two vertices $u$ and $v$ is the number of edges on the unique shortest path between them.\n\n**Part 1: Closeness Centrality**\n\nThe closeness centrality of a vertex $u$ is defined as $C_C(u) = \\frac{n-1}{\\sum_{v \\neq u} d(u,v)}$. Maximizing $C_C(u)$ is equivalent to minimizing the total distance from $u$ to all other vertices, $S_d(u) = \\sum_{v \\neq u, v \\in V} d(u,v)$.\n\nWe first derive a general expression for $S_d(v_m)$ for a vertex $v_m$ on the path, where $m \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 9\\}$. The sum of distances can be decomposed into the sum of distances to other path vertices and the sum of distances to the pendant vertices.\n\nThe distance from $v_m$ to another path vertex $v_i$ is $d(v_m, v_i) = |m-i|$. The sum of these distances is:\n$$ \\sum_{i=0, i \\neq m}^{9} d(v_m, v_i) = \\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} (m-i) + \\sum_{i=m+1}^{9} (i-m) $$\nThe first sum is a sum of an arithmetic progression: $\\sum_{k=1}^{m} k = \\frac{m(m+1)}{2}$.\nThe second sum is also: $\\sum_{k=1}^{9-m} k = \\frac{(9-m)(10-m)}{2}$.\nSo, the sum of distances to other path vertices is $\\frac{m(m+1)}{2} + \\frac{(9-m)(10-m)}{2}$.\n\nThe distance from $v_m$ to any pendant vertex $w_j$ is $d(v_m, w_j) = d(v_m, v_0) + d(v_0, w_j) = m + 1$. Since there are $3$ such vertices, this part of the sum is $3(m+1)$.\n\nCombining these, the total distance from $v_m$ is:\n$$ S_d(v_m) = \\frac{m(m+1)}{2} + \\frac{(9-m)(10-m)}{2} + 3(m+1) $$\n$$ S_d(v_m) = \\frac{1}{2}(m^2+m) + \\frac{1}{2}(90 - 19m + m^2) + 3m + 3 $$\n$$ S_d(v_m) = \\frac{1}{2}(2m^2 - 18m + 90) + 3m + 3 = m^2 - 9m + 45 + 3m + 3 $$\n$$ S_d(v_m) = m^2 - 6m + 48 $$\nThis is the required expression. To find the vertex $v_m$ that minimizes this sum, we find the minimum of the quadratic function $f(m) = m^2 - 6m + 48$. The vertex of this parabola occurs at $m = -\\frac{-6}{2(1)} = 3$. Since $m$ must be an integer, $m=3$ is the minimizer among the path vertices. The minimum sum is $S_d(v_3) = (3)^2 - 6(3) + 48 = 9 - 18 + 48 = 39$.\n\nNext, we must consider the pendant vertices. By symmetry, they all have the same sum of distances. Let's calculate $S_d(w_1)$:\nThe set of vertices other than $w_1$ is $\\{w_2, w_3\\} \\cup \\{v_0, \\dots, v_9\\}$.\n$d(w_1, w_2) = d(w_1, v_0) + d(v_0, w_2) = 1+1=2$. Similarly, $d(w_1, w_3) = 2$.\n$d(w_1, v_i) = d(w_1, v_0) + d(v_0, v_i) = 1+i$.\nSo, the sum of distances is:\n$$ S_d(w_1) = d(w_1, w_2) + d(w_1, w_3) + \\sum_{i=0}^{9} d(w_1, v_i) $$\n$$ S_d(w_1) = 2 + 2 + \\sum_{i=0}^{9} (1+i) = 4 + \\sum_{k=1}^{10} k = 4 + \\frac{10(11)}{2} = 4+55 = 59 $$\nComparing the minimum sum for a path vertex, $S_d(v_3)=39$, with the sum for a pendant vertex, $S_d(w_1)=59$, we find that $S_d(v_3)$ is the global minimum. Therefore, the vertex that maximizes closeness centrality is $v_3$.\n\nThe closeness centrality of $v_3$ is:\n$$ C_C(v_3) = \\frac{n-1}{S_d(v_3)} = \\frac{13-1}{39} = \\frac{12}{39} = \\frac{4}{13} $$\n\n**Part 2: Harmonic Centrality**\n\nThe harmonic centrality of a vertex $u$ is defined as $C_H(u) = \\sum_{v \\neq u, v \\in V} \\frac{1}{d(u,v)}$. We seek the vertex that maximizes this sum.\n\nWe first derive an expression for $C_H(v_m)$ for a path vertex $v_m$, $m \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 9\\}$.\n$$ C_H(v_m) = \\sum_{i=0, i \\neq m}^{9} \\frac{1}{d(v_m, v_i)} + \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\frac{1}{d(v_m, w_j)} $$\nThe first sum is $\\sum_{i=0, i \\neq m}^{9} \\frac{1}{|m-i|} = \\sum_{k=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{k} + \\sum_{k=1}^{9-m} \\frac{1}{k} = H_m + H_{9-m}$, where $H_k$ is the $k$-th harmonic number, and we use the convention $H_0 = 0$.\nThe second sum is $\\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\frac{1}{m+1} = \\frac{3}{m+1}$.\nThus, the harmonic centrality of $v_m$ is:\n$$ C_H(v_m) = H_m + H_{9-m} + \\frac{3}{m+1} $$\nTo find the maximum, we analyze the behavior of this function for $m \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 9\\}$. The term $\\frac{3}{m+1}$ is strictly decreasing as $m$ increases. The term $H_m + H_{9-m}$ is symmetric about $m=4.5$ and has its maximum values at the endpoints $m=0$ and $m=9$ ($H_0+H_9 = H_9$ and $H_9+H_0 = H_9$). The sum of these two terms will therefore be a decreasing function of $m$. The maximum must occur at $m=0$. Let's calculate $C_H(v_0)$:\n$$ C_H(v_0) = H_0 + H_9 + \\frac{3}{0+1} = 0 + H_9 + 3 $$\nThe $9$-th harmonic number is $H_9 = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{7129}{2520}$.\n$$ C_H(v_0) = 3 + \\frac{7129}{2520} = \\frac{3 \\times 2520 + 7129}{2520} = \\frac{7560 + 7129}{2520} = \\frac{14689}{2520} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the harmonic centrality for a pendant vertex, say $w_1$.\n$$ C_H(w_1) = \\frac{1}{d(w_1, w_2)} + \\frac{1}{d(w_1, w_3)} + \\sum_{i=0}^{9} \\frac{1}{d(w_1, v_i)} $$\n$$ C_H(w_1) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\sum_{i=0}^{9} \\frac{1}{1+i} = 1 + \\sum_{k=1}^{10} \\frac{1}{k} = 1 + H_{10} $$\n$H_{10} = H_9 + \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{7129}{2520} + \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{7129 + 252}{2520} = \\frac{7381}{2520}$.\n$$ C_H(w_1) = 1 + \\frac{7381}{2520} = \\frac{2520 + 7381}{2520} = \\frac{9901}{2520} $$\nTo find the vertex with the maximum harmonic centrality, we compare $C_H(v_0) = \\frac{14689}{2520} \\approx 5.829$ with $C_H(w_1) = \\frac{9901}{2520} \\approx 3.929$. Since $C_H(v_m)$ is a decreasing function of $m$, it is clear that $C_H(v_0)$ is the maximum value.\nThus, the vertex that maximizes harmonic centrality is $v_0$.\n\n**Demonstration and Conclusion**\n\nThe vertex maximizing closeness centrality is $v_3$, with $C_C(v_3) = \\frac{4}{13}$.\nThe vertex maximizing harmonic centrality is $v_0$, with $C_H(v_0) = \\frac{14689}{2520}$.\nSince $v_3 \\neq v_0$, we have demonstrated that the vertex maximizing closeness centrality is not the same as the vertex maximizing harmonic centrality for this tree. This phenomenon occurs because closeness centrality is sensitive to large distances, pushing its maximum away from endpoints, while harmonic centrality gives more weight to shorter distances, pulling its maximum towards vertices with many close neighbors, like the high-degree vertex $v_0$.\n\nThe final answer consists of the ordered pair of the two calculated maximum centrality values (closeness, harmonic).\n- Maximum closeness centrality (for $v_3$): $\\frac{4}{13}$\n- Maximum harmonic centrality (for $v_0$): $\\frac{14689}{2520}$",

            "solution": "The problem requires a multi-step analysis of the specified directed graph $G$. We will address each task in order.\n\n**Task 1: Justify Strong Connectivity**\n\nA directed graph is strongly connected if for every ordered pair of distinct vertices $(v, w)$, there exists a directed path from $v$ to $w$.\n\nThe graph $G$ contains the directed cycle $1 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 5 \\to 6 \\to 7 \\to 8 \\to 1$. This cycle is a Hamiltonian cycle, as it visits every vertex in the graph exactly once before returning to the start.\n\nLet $v$ and $w$ be any two distinct vertices in $V$. The existence of the Hamiltonian cycle guarantees a path from $v$ to $w$. We can start at vertex $v$ and traverse the edges of the cycle, $(v, (v \\pmod 8) + 1), ((v \\pmod 8) + 1, ((v \\pmod 8) + 1 \\pmod 8) + 1), \\dots$, until we reach vertex $w$. This constitutes a path from $v$ to $w$.\n\nSince a path exists from any vertex $v$ to any other vertex $w$, the graph $G$ is, by definition, strongly connected. The additional edges do not affect this property, they only potentially shorten the paths between certain vertices.\n\n**Task 2: Compute Shortest-Path Distances**\n\nLet $d(v, w)$ denote the length of a shortest directed path from vertex $v$ to vertex $w$. We need to compute the distances from $u=1$ to all other vertices (out-distances) and from all other vertices to $u=1$ (in-distances). The number of vertices is $n=8$.\n\n**Out-distances from $u=1$:**\nWe need to find $d(1, v)$ for all $v \\in \\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\}$.\n- For $v=2$: The directed edge $1 \\to 2$ is part of the fundamental cycle. Thus, $d(1, 2) = 1$.\n- For $v \\in \\{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\}$: The problem states that the directed edges $1 \\to 3$, $1 \\to 4$, $1 \\to 5$, $1 \\to 6$, $1 \\to 7$, and $1 \\to 8$ are added to the graph. The existence of these direct edges means the shortest path length is $1$.\n- Therefore, for all $v \\in V \\setminus \\{1\\}$, the shortest-path distance from vertex $1$ is $d(1, v) = 1$.\n\n**In-distances to $u=1$:**\nWe need to find $d(v, 1)$ for all $v \\in \\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\}$.\n- The only edge directed into vertex $1$ is the edge $8 \\to 1$ from the cycle.\n- Consequently, any directed path from a vertex $v$ to vertex $1$ must terminate with the edge $8 \\to 1$. The length of such a path is $d(v, 1) = d(v, 8) + d(8, 1) = d(v, 8) + 1$.\n- Now we must find the shortest path $d(v, 8)$ for $v \\in \\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$. The edges available are the cycle edges $(i, i+1)$ and the shortcut edges $(1, j)$ for $j \\ge 3$. A path from $v$ to $8$ that utilizes a shortcut edge must first go to vertex $1$. Such a path would look like $v \\to \\dots \\to 1 \\to j \\to \\dots \\to 8$. This would necessarily be longer than simply following the cycle edges $v \\to v+1 \\to \\dots \\to 8$, since any path from $v \\neq 1$ to $1$ has a length of at least $1$. For instance, for $v=7$, the path $7 \\to 8$ has length $1$. The path $7 \\to 1 \\to 8$ has length $d(7,1)+d(1,8) = 2+1=3$. The cycle path is shorter. This reasoning holds for all $v \\in \\{2, \\ldots, 7\\}$.\n- Therefore, the shortest path from any vertex $v$ to $8$ follows the cycle. The path is $v \\to v+1 \\to \\dots \\to 7 \\to 8$.\n- The length of this path is $d(v, 8) = 8-v$.\n- We can now compute the in-distances to vertex $1$:\n  - $d(8, 1) = 1$ (direct edge).\n  - $d(7, 1) = d(7, 8) + 1 = (8-7) + 1 = 2$.\n  - $d(6, 1) = d(6, 8) + 1 = (8-6) + 1 = 3$.\n  - $d(5, 1) = d(5, 8) + 1 = (8-5) + 1 = 4$.\n  - $d(4, 1) = d(4, 8) + 1 = (8-4) + 1 = 5$.\n  - $d(3, 1) = d(3, 8) + 1 = (8-3) + 1 = 6$.\n  - $d(2, 1) = d(2, 8) + 1 = (8-2) + 1 = 7$.\nThe set of in-distances to vertex $1$ from all other vertices is $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$.\n\n**Task 3: Compute Closeness Centrality**\n\nThe closeness centrality is defined separately for out- and in-distances.

The numerator $1089 = 33^2 = 3^2 \\times 11^2$. The denominator $420 = 42 \\times 10 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 7 \\times 2 \\times 5 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7$. The greatest common divisor is $3$.\n$$H^{\\text{in}}(1) = \\frac{1089 \\div 3}{420 \\div 3} = \\frac{363}{140}$$\nThe fraction $\\frac{363}{140}$ is fully reduced since $363 = 3 \\times 11^2$ and $140 = 2^2 \\times 5 \\times 7$ share no common factors.\n\n**Final Result Compilation**\nThe required quantities are:\n- $C^{\\text{out}}(1) = 1$\n- $C^{\\text{in}}(1) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n- $H^{\\text{out}}(1) = 7$\n- $H^{\\text{in}}(1) = \\frac{363}{140}$\n\nThese are to be presented in a single row matrix in the specified order.",
