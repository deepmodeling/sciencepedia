The concepts of degree sequence, simple graphs, $k$-core decomposition, and degeneracy are well-defined and standard.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. The existence of a graph with the given degree sequence is guaranteed by the Erdős–Gallai theorem, and a necessary condition, the handshaking lemma, is satisfied, as the sum of degrees is $3+3+2+2+1+1=12$, which is an even number. The problem asks for the construction of one such graph and the determination of its degeneracy, a uniquely defined property for any given graph.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, objective mathematical language and definitions.\n- **Conclusion**: The problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective, with a clear and formalizable task.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Development**\n\nThe first step is to construct a simple undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ on the vertex set $V=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$ that realizes the degree sequence $(3,3,2,2,1,1)$. We can assign the degrees to the vertices as follows: $\\deg(1)=3$, $\\deg(2)=3$, $\\deg(3)=2$, $\\deg(4)=2$, $\\deg(5)=1$, and $\\deg(6)=1$.\n\nA methodical way to construct such a graph is to first satisfy the vertices with the lowest degrees. The vertices with degree $1$, namely vertex $5$ and vertex $6$, must be connected to some other vertex. Let's connect them to the two vertices of highest degree to maximally contain the graph's core. We connect vertex $5$ to vertex $1$ and vertex $6$ to vertex $2$.\nThe edges added so far are $(1,5)$ and $(2,6)$.\nThe remaining degrees to be satisfied for each vertex are:\n- $\\deg(1): 3-1 = 2$\n- $\\deg(2): 3-1 = 2$\n- $\\deg(3): 2-0 = 2$\n- $\\deg(4): 2-0 = 2$\n- $\\deg(5): 1-1 = 0$\n- $\\deg(6): 1-1 = 0$\nWe now need to construct a graph on the vertex set $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ where every vertex has a degree of $2$. A $4$-cycle graph, or $C_4$, is a $2$-regular graph on $4$ vertices. We can form the cycle by adding the edges $(1,3)$, $(3,2)$, $(2,4)$, and $(4,1)$.\n\nLet's consolidate the edge set $E$ and verify the degrees for the constructed graph $G$:\n- Edge set $E = \\{(1,5), (2,6), (1,3), (3,2), (2,4), (4,1)\\}$.\nThe edges can be listed as $\\{(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,6)\\}$.\n- The degrees of the vertices are:\n  - $\\deg(1)$: connections to $3, 4, 5$. Thus, $\\deg(1)=3$.\n  - $\\deg(2)$: connections to $3, 4, 6$. Thus, $\\deg(2)=3$.\n  - $\\deg(3)$: connections to $1, 2$. Thus, $\\deg(3)=2$.\n  - $\\deg(4)$: connections to $1, 2$. Thus, $\\deg(4)=2$.\n  - $\\deg(5)$: connection to $1$. Thus, $\\deg(5)=1$.\n  - $\\deg(6)$: connection to $2$. Thus, $\\deg(6)=1$.\n\nThe sorted degree sequence is $(3,3,2,2,1,1)$, which matches the problem requirement. The graph is simple as it contains no self-loops or multiple edges.\n\nNext, we perform the $k$-core decomposition of this graph $G$ by iterative pruning.\n\n**$1$-core ($C_1$):**\nThe $1$-core is found by removing all vertices with degree less than $1$ (i.e., degree $0$). In our graph $G$, the minimum degree is $1$. No vertex has a degree less than $1$. Therefore, no vertices are removed. The $1$-core is the graph itself.\n$C_1 = G$, with vertex set $V(C_1) = \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$. The $1$-core is non-empty.\n\n**$2$-core ($C_2$):**\nTo find the $2$-core, we start with $C_1$ (which is $G$) and recursively remove all vertices with degree less than $2$.\n- **Initial Graph ($C_1=G$):** The degrees are $(\\deg(1)=3, \\deg(2)=3, \\deg(3)=2, \\deg(4)=2, \\deg(5)=1, \\deg(6)=1)$.\n- **Iteration 1:** We identify vertices with degree less than $2$. These are vertex $5$ and vertex $6$, both with degree $1$. We remove these vertices and their incident edges, which are $(1,5)$ and $(2,6)$.\n- The remaining vertex set is $V' = \\{1,2,3,4\\}$. The subgraph induced by $V'$ has the edge set $E' = \\{(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)\\}$.\n- We must now re-calculate the degrees of the remaining vertices *within this new subgraph*:\n  - $\\deg_{V'}(1) = 2$ (was $3$, edge $(1,5)$ removed).\n  - $\\deg_{V'}(2) = 2$ (was $3$, edge $(2,6)$ removed).\n  - $\\deg_{V'}(3) = 2$ (no incident edges removed).\n  - $\\deg_{V'}(4) = 2$ (no incident edges removed).\n- **Iteration 2:** In the current subgraph on $V'$, all vertices have a degree of $2$. There are no vertices with degree less than $2$. The removal process terminates.\n- The resulting $2$-core, $C_2$, is the subgraph induced by the vertex set $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$. This is a $4$-cycle, which is a non-empty graph.\n\n**$3$-core ($C_3$):**\nTo find the $3$-core, we start with $C_2$ and recursively remove all vertices with degree less than $3$.\n- **Initial Graph ($C_2$):** The vertex set is $V(C_2) = \\{1,2,3,4\\}$, and the degree of every vertex in this induced subgraph is $2$.\n- **Iteration 1:** We identify vertices with degree less than $3$. All vertices in $C_2$ have degree $2$, so all four vertices $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ have degrees less than $3$. We remove all of them.\n- The resulting graph has an empty vertex set.\n- The $3$-core, $C_3$, is the empty graph, $\\emptyset$.\n\nSince the $3$-core is empty, all subsequent $k$-cores for $k3$ will also be empty, as the cores form a nested sequence of subgraphs, i.e., $C_{k+1} \\subseteq C_k$.\n\n**Determining the Degeneracy**\nThe degeneracy of a graph is defined as the largest integer $k$ for which the $k$-core is non-empty. Based on our decomposition:\n- $C_1$ is non-empty.\n- $C_2$ is non-empty.\n- $C_3$ is empty.\nThe largest value of $k$ for which $C_k$ is non-empty is $k=2$. Therefore, the degeneracy of the constructed graph is $2$.\n\n**Justification**\nThe degeneracy is $2$ because the $2$-core of the graph is the non-empty subgraph induced by vertices $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$, which forms a $4$-cycle. However, the $3$-core is the empty graph. This is because the process to find the $3$-core begins with the $2$-core, in which every vertex has a degree of $2$. Since all these degrees are less than $3$, all vertices of the $2$-core are removed, yielding an empty graph for $C_3$. As the largest $k$ for which the $k$-core is non-empty is $2$, the degeneracy is confirmed to be $2$.",

The components of the graph are well-defined standard structures.

A crucial condition is that the components $A$ and $B$ must be \"entirely contained in the $k$-shell\" for $k=2$. Let's verify this.\n\nFirst, we determine the vertex degrees in $G$. Since $G$ is a disjoint union, the degree of a vertex is its degree within its component.\n*   In component $A$ (ladder graph, $n=13$):\n    *   The four \"corner\" vertices $\\{u_1, v_1, u_{13}, v_{13}\\}$ each have $2$ neighbors. For example, $u_1$ is connected to $u_2$ and $v_1$. So, their degree is $2$.\n    *   The remaining $2 \\times (13-2) = 22$ vertices $\\{u_i, v_i\\}_{i=2}^{12}$ each have $3$ neighbors. For example, $u_i$ is connected to $u_{i-1}, u_{i+1}, v_i$. Their degree is $3$.\n*   In component $B$ (cycle graph $C_{20}$):\n    *   Every vertex is connected to two other vertices. Thus, all $20$ vertices have a degree of $2$.\n\nNext, we perform a $k$-core decomposition of $G$.\n*   The minimum degree in $G$ is $\\delta(G) = 2$.\n*   The $1$-core, $C_1(G)$, is found by removing vertices with degree $1$. There are none, so $C_1(G) = G$.\n*   The $2$-core, $C_2(G)$, is found by removing vertices with degree $2$. There are none, so $C_2(G) = G$.\n*   The $3$-core, $C_3(G)$, is found by iteratively removing vertices with degree $3$.\n    1.  Initially, all vertices in component $B$ (degree $2$) and the four corner vertices of component $A$ (degree $2$) must be removed.\n    2.  Removing the corner vertices $\\{u_1, v_1, u_{13}, v_{13}\\}$ from $A$ reduces the degrees of their neighbors $\\{u_2, v_2, u_{12}, v_{12}\\}$ from $3$ to $2$.\n    3.  In the next iteration, these newly created degree-$2$ vertices must also be removed.\n    4.  This removal process propagates inward from both ends of the ladder graph until all vertices of component $A$ are removed.\n    5.  Therefore, no vertices from $G$ survive this iterative removal. The $3$-core is the empty graph: $C_3(G) = \\emptyset$.\n\nThe $k$-shell is defined as the set of vertices in the $k$-core but not in the $(k+1)$-core. For $k=2$, the $2$-shell is $S_2 = C_2(G) \\setminus C_3(G)$.\n*   $S_2 = G \\setminus \\emptyset = G$.\nThe $2$-shell is the entire graph $G$.

It is deemed **valid**. We proceed to the solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe goal is to compute the robustness gap $\\Delta = D_2(A) - D_2(B)$. This requires finding the within-shell onion-layer depths, $D_2(A)$ and $D_2(B)$, using the provided onion decomposition algorithm for $k=2$. As established, the $2$-shell is the entire graph $G$, so the decomposition process starts with $G$ and involves iteratively removing vertices with a current degree of at most $2$.\n\n**Analysis of Component B ($C_{20}$)**\n\nComponent $B$ is a cycle graph $C_{20}$. Every one of its $20$ vertices has a degree of $2$.\n*   **Wave 1**: We identify all vertices in $G$ with degree $\\le 2$. All $20$ vertices of component $B$ meet this criterion. Thus, all vertices of $B$ are removed in the first wave.\n*   These vertices are assigned to layer $\\ell_2 = 1$.\n*   The maximum layer index for any vertex in component $B$ is $1$.\n*   Therefore, the within-shell onion-layer depth for $B$ at $k=2$ is $D_2(B) = 1$.\n\n**Analysis of Component A (Ladder Graph)**\n\nComponent $A$ is a ladder graph of length $n=13$. We apply the same iterative removal process. The degrees are computed in the graph as it evolves.\n\n*   **Initial State**: Component $A$ has $4$ vertices with degree $2$ (at indices $i=1$ and $i=13$) and $22$ vertices with degree $3$ (at indices $i=2, \\dots, 12$).\n*   **Wave 1 (Layer $\\ell_2=1$)**: We remove all vertices with degree $\\le 2$. These are the four corner vertices: $\\{u_1, v_1, u_{13}, v_{13}\\}$. These vertices constitute layer $\\ell_2=1$ for component $A$.\n*   **Wave 2 (Layer $\\ell_2=2$)**: After removing the Layer $1$ vertices, we recompute the degrees of the remaining vertices. The neighbors of the removed vertices are $\\{u_2, v_2, u_{12}, v_{12}\\}$.\n    *   The degree of $u_2$, initially $3$, becomes $2$ after its neighbor $u_1$ is removed.\n    *   The degree of $v_2$, initially $3$, becomes $2$ after its neighbor $v_1$ is removed.\n    *   The degree of $u_{12}$, initially $3$, becomes $2$ after its neighbor $u_{13}$ is removed.\n    *   The degree of $v_{12}$, initially $3$, becomes $2$ after its neighbor $v_{13}$ is removed.\n    *   All other remaining vertices, $\\{u_i,v_i\\}$ for $i \\in \\{3, \\dots, 11\\}$, are not adjacent to Layer $1$ vertices, so their degrees remain $3$.\n    *   In the second wave, we remove the new set of vertices with degree $\\le 2$, which is $\\{u_2, v_2, u_{12}, v_{12}\\}$. These vertices form layer $\\ell_2=2$.\n*   **Subsequent Waves**: This process continues, peeling the ladder graph from both ends towards the center. At each wave $j$, the vertices from rung-pairs $j$ and $(13-j+1)=14-j$ are removed.\n    *   Layer $\\ell_2=1$: Vertices from rungs $1$ and $13$.\n    *   Layer $\\ell_2=2$: Vertices from rungs $2$ and $12$.\n    *   Layer $\\ell_2=3$: Vertices from rungs $3$ and $11$.\n    *   Layer $\\ell_2=4$: Vertices from rungs $4$ and $10$.\n    *   Layer $\\ell_2=5$: Vertices from rungs $5$ and $9$.\n    *   Layer $\\ell_2=6$: Vertices from rungs $6$ and $8$.\n*   **Final Wave**: After Layer $6$ is removed, the only remaining vertices are those of the central rung, $i=7$, because $n=13$ is odd. The remaining vertices are $\\{u_7, v_7\\}$.\n    *   In the original graph $A$, $u_7$ was connected to $u_6, u_8$, and $v_7$, so its degree was $3$.\n    *   Similarly, $v_7$ was connected to $v_6, v_8$, and $u_7$, so its degree was $3$.\n    *   The vertices $\\{u_6, v_6\\}$ and $\\{u_8, v_8\\}$ are all part of layer $\\ell_2=6$. After their removal, the only remaining edge for $u_7$ is to $v_7$, and for $v_7$ is to $u_7$.\n    *   Thus, in the graph remaining after Wave 6, the degrees of both $u_7$ and $v_7$ become $1$.\n    *   In the next wave, we remove vertices with degree $\\le 2$. Both $u_7$ and $v_7$ satisfy this condition. They are removed.\n    *   These two vertices, $\\{u_7, v_7\\}$, constitute layer $\\ell_2=7$.\n\nThe peeling process for component $A$ takes $7$ waves. The maximum layer index assigned to any vertex in $A$ is $7$.\nIn general, for a ladder graph of length $n$, the number of layers in this peeling process is $\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\rceil$. For $n=13$, this is $\\lceil \\frac{13}{2} \\rceil = \\lceil 6.5 \\rceil = 7$.\nTherefore, the within-shell onion-layer depth for $A$ at $k=2$ is $D_2(A) = 7$.\n\n**Calculation of the Robustness Gap**\n\nThe robustness gap $\\Delta$ is defined as the difference between the depths of the two components:\n$$\n\\Delta = D_2(A) - D_2(B)\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\n\\Delta = 7 - 1 = 6\n$$\nThe robustness gap between components $A$ and $B$ at shell $k=2$ is $6$.",
