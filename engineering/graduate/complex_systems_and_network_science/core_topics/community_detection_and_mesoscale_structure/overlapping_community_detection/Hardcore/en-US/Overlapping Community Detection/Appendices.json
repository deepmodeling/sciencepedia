            "solution": "The problem asks for the determination of communities using the Clique Percolation Method (CPM) with a clique size of $k=3$ for a specially constructed graph $G$, followed by the calculation of the Jaccard similarity between the identified communities. The analysis proceeds in a series of logical steps.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of $k=3$ Cliques\n\nA $k$-clique is a complete subgraph of $k$ nodes. For $k=3$, a $3$-clique is a triangle. The problem statement explicitly defines the triangles present in the graph $G$.\n\nThe graph $G$ is composed of two subgraphs, ring $\\mathcal{A}$ and ring $\\mathcal{B}$, joined at a single node $x$, where $x=a_0=b_0$.\n\n**Cliques in Ring $\\mathcal{A}$:**\nThe node set is $\\{a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5\\}$. The triangles are formed by the sets $\\{a_i, a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}\\}$ for $i \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$, with indices taken modulo $6$. The set of $6$ triangles in ring $\\mathcal{A}$ is:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $C_{A,0} = \\{a_0, a_1, a_2\\}$\n    \\item $C_{A,1} = \\{a_1, a_2, a_3\\}$\n    \\item $C_{A,2} = \\{a_2, a_3, a_4\\}$\n    \\item $C_{A,3} = \\{a_3, a_4, a_5\\}$\n    \\item $C_{A,4} = \\{a_4, a_5, a_0\\}$\n    \\item $C_{A,5} = \\{a_5, a_0, a_1\\}$\n\\end{itemize}\n\n**Cliques in Ring $\\mathcal{B}$:**\nThe node set is $\\{b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4, b_5, b_6, b_7\\}$. The triangles are formed by the sets $\\{b_j, b_{j+1}, b_{j+2}\\}$ for $j \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$, with indices taken modulo $8$. The set of $8$ triangles in ring $\\mathcal{B}$ is:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $C_{B,0} = \\{b_0, b_1, b_2\\}$\n    \\item $C_{B,1} = \\{b_1, b_2, b_3\\}$\n    \\item $C_{B,2} = \\{b_2, b_3, b_4\\}$\n    \\item $C_{B,3} = \\{b_3, b_4, b_5\\}$\n    \\item $C_{B,4} = \\{b_4, b_5, b_6\\}$\n    \\item $C_{B,5} = \\{b_5, b_6, b_7\\}$\n    \\item $C_{B,6} = \\{b_6, b_7, b_0\\}$\n    \\item $C_{B,7} = \\{b_7, b_0, b_1\\}$\n\\end{itemize}\n\nNo other edges or triangles exist in the graph $G$.\n\n### Step 2: Adjacency of $k=3$ Cliques\n\nAccording to the CPM definition, two $k$-cliques are adjacent if they share exactly $k-1$ nodes. For $k=3$, this means two triangles must share exactly $3-1 = 2$ nodes (i.e., an edge).\n\n**Adjacency within Ring $\\mathcal{A}$:**\nConsider any two consecutively indexed triangles, e.g., $C_{A,i} = \\{a_i, a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}\\}$ and $C_{A,i+1} = \\{a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}, a_{i+3}\\}$. Their intersection is $C_{A,i} \\cap C_{A,i+1} = \\{a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}\\}$. The size of this intersection is $2$. Thus, $C_{A,i}$ and $C_{A,i+1}$ are adjacent for all $i \\in \\{0, 1, ..., 5\\}$. This forms a path of adjacent cliques:\n$$ C_{A,0} \\leftrightarrow C_{A,1} \\leftrightarrow C_{A,2} \\leftrightarrow C_{A,3} \\leftrightarrow C_{A,4} \\leftrightarrow C_{A,5} \\leftrightarrow C_{A,0} $$\nSince all $6$ triangles in ring $\\mathcal{A}$ are connected through a path of adjacent cliques, they form a single maximal connected component.\n\n**Adjacency within Ring $\\mathcal{B}$:**\nSimilarly, for ring $\\mathcal{B}$, consider $C_{B,j} = \\{b_j, b_{j+1}, b_{j+2}\\}$ and $C_{B,j+1} = \\{b_{j+1}, b_{j+2}, b_{j+3}\\}$. Their intersection is $C_{B,j} \\cap C_{B,j+1} = \\{b_{j+1}, b_{j+2}\\}$, which has size $2$. Thus, $C_{B,j}$ and $C_{B,j+1}$ are adjacent for all $j \\in \\{0, 1, ..., 7\\}$. This also forms a cycle of adjacent cliques. All $8$ triangles in ring $\\mathcal{B}$ are part of a single maximal connected component.\n\n**Adjacency between Rings $\\mathcal{A}$ and $\\mathcal{B}$:**\nFor a clique from ring $\\mathcal{A}$ to be adjacent to a clique from ring $\\mathcal{B}$, they must share $2$ nodes. The nodes of ring $\\mathcal{A}$ are $\\{a_0, ..., a_5\\}$ and those of ring $\\mathcal{B}$ are $\\{b_0, ..., b_7\\}$. The problem specifies that the only identification between these sets is $a_0 = b_0 = x$. Therefore, the intersection of the node sets of the two rings is just $\\{x\\}$. Any clique from ring $\\mathcal{A}$ and any clique from ring $\\mathcal{B}$ can share at most this one node. Since they cannot share $2$ nodes, no clique from $\\mathcal{A}$ is adjacent to any clique from $\\mathcal{B}$.\n\n### Step 3: CPM Communities and Overlapping Nodes\n\nThe $k$-clique percolation communities are the maximal unions of $k$-cliques that are path-connected through adjacency. From the analysis above, there are exactly two such communities.\n\n**Community 1 ($X$):**\nThis community is formed by the union of all cliques in ring $\\mathcal{A}$. The node set of this community, denoted $X$, is the union of the nodes in these cliques:\n$$ X = \\bigcup_{i=0}^{5} C_{A,i} = \\{a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5\\} $$\nThe number of nodes in this community is $|X| = 6$.\n\n**Community 2 ($Y$):**\nThis community is formed by the union of all cliques in ring $\\mathcal{B}$. The node set of this community, denoted $Y$, is:\n$$ Y = \\bigcup_{j=0}^{7} C_{B,j} = \\{b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4, b_5, b_6, b_7\\} $$\nThe number of nodes in this community is $|Y| = 8$.\n\nThe nodes that belong to more than one community are those in the intersection of the node sets $X$ and $Y$.\n$$ X \\cap Y = \\{a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5\\} \\cap \\{b_0, b_1, \\dots, b_7\\} $$\nGiven that $a_0 = b_0 = x$ is the only shared node, the intersection is:\n$$ X \\cap Y = \\{x\\} $$\nThe number of overlapping nodes is $|X \\cap Y| = 1$. The single overlapping node is $x$.\n\n### Step 4: Jaccard Similarity Coefficient\n\nThe Jaccard similarity coefficient between two sets $X$ and $Y$ is defined as $J(X,Y) = \\frac{|X \\cap Y|}{|X \\cup Y|}$.\n\nWe have already found $|X \\cap Y| = 1$.\nThe size of the union of the node sets can be calculated using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n$$ |X \\cup Y| = |X| + |Y| - |X \\cap Y| $$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$ |X \\cup Y| = 6 + 8 - 1 = 13 $$\nThis value is the total number of distinct nodes in the graph $G$.\n\nNow, we can compute the Jaccard similarity coefficient:\n$$ J(X,Y) = \\frac{|X \\cap Y|}{|X \\cup Y|} = \\frac{1}{13} $$\nThe fraction $\\frac{1}{13}$ is in its simplest form.",

The leaves inside $C'$ have no other connections.\n$$k_{\\text{out}}(C_s \\cup \\{h\\}) = m-s$$\nThe objective function for the expanded community is:\n$$f_{\\lambda}(C_s \\cup \\{h\\}) = s - \\lambda(m-s)$$\n\nNow, we can compute the fitness gain $\\Delta f_{\\lambda}(C_s; h)$:\n$$ \\Delta f_{\\lambda}(C_s; h) = f_{\\lambda}(C_s \\cup \\{h\\}) - f_{\\lambda}(C_s) = [s - \\lambda(m-s)] - [-\\lambda s] $$\n$$ \\Delta f_{\\lambda}(C_s; h) = s - \\lambda(m-s) + \\lambda s = s - \\lambda m + 2\\lambda s = s - \\lambda(m-2s) $$\n\nThe first part of the problem asks to explain why for small $\\lambda$, the hub $h$ is added to many distinct seed sets. A node is added if its fitness gain is positive, i.e., $\\Delta f_{\\lambda}(C_s; h)  0$.\nThe gain is a linear function of $\\lambda$. At $\\lambda=0$, the gain is $\\Delta f_0(C_s; h) = s$. Since the problem specifies $1 \\le s  m$, $s$ is always positive. Thus, for $\\lambda=0$, the hub is always added to the seed set. By continuity, for any given $s$ and $m$, there must exist an interval of $\\lambda$ values, $(0, \\epsilon)$ for some $\\epsilon  0$, for which the gain $\\Delta f_{\\lambda}(C_s;h)$ remains positive. The result for the gain, $s - \\lambda(m-2s)$, is independent of the specific choice of leaves, depending only on their number, $s$. There are $\\binom{m}{s}$ ways to choose $s$ leaves to form a seed set $C_s$. For a small enough $\\lambda$, the hub $h$ will be added to any community seeded by any of these $\\binom{m}{s}$ distinct sets, resulting in its spurious assignment to a large number of overlapping communities.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires deriving the minimal resolution parameter $\\lambda^{\\star}(s)$ that ensures the hub is not added greedily, i.e., $\\Delta f_{\\lambda}(C_s; h) \\le 0$. This sets the condition:\n$$ s - \\lambda(m-2s) \\le 0 $$\nTo solve for $\\lambda$, we must consider the sign of the term $(m-2s)$.\nCase 1: $m - 2s > 0$, which is equivalent to $s  m/2$.\nIn this case, we can rearrange the inequality:\n$$ s \\le \\lambda(m-2s) $$\nSince $(m-2s)$ is a positive quantity, we can divide by it without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$ \\lambda \\ge \\frac{s}{m-2s} $$\nThe minimal value of $\\lambda$ that satisfies this condition is the boundary value. Therefore, the minimal resolution parameter is:\n$$ \\lambda^{\\star}(s) = \\frac{s}{m-2s} $$\nThis expression gives the threshold value for $\\lambda$. For any $\\lambda  \\lambda^{\\star}(s)$, the hub will be absorbed, and for any $\\lambda \\ge \\lambda^{\\star}(s)$, it will not.\n\nCase 2: $m - 2s \\le 0$, which is equivalent to $s \\ge m/2$.\nThe gain is $\\Delta f_{\\lambda}(C_s; h) = s - \\lambda(m-2s) = s + \\lambda(2s-m)$.\nSince $s \\ge 1$, $\\lambda \\ge 0$, and $(2s-m) \\ge 0$, the gain $\\Delta f_{\\lambda}(C_s; h)$ is always positive. It can never be less than or equal to zero. In this regime, the topological pull of the seed set on the hub is too strong to be overcome by the penalty on outgoing links, regardless of how large $\\lambda$ becomes. Thus, a finite, non-negative value for $\\lambda^{\\star}(s)$ does not exist.\nThe problem, however, asks for a general closed-form expression for $\\lambda^{\\star}(s)$. The expression derived in Case 1, $\\lambda^{\\star}(s) = \\frac{s}{m-2s}$, is that general form. It correctly defines the critical boundary for the regime where such a resolution parameter exists ($s  m/2$). As $s$ approaches $m/2$ from below, $\\lambda^{\\star}(s)$ diverges to $+\\infty$, which is consistent with the finding in Case 2 that no finite $\\lambda$ can prevent the hub's inclusion when $s \\ge m/2$. Therefore, this expression is the answer.",
