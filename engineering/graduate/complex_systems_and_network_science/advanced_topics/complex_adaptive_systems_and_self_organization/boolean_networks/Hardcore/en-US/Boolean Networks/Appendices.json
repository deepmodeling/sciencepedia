This network consists of three genes, which we will label Gene 1, Gene 2, and Gene 3. The state of each gene is binary: 1 represents 'active' and 0 represents 'inactive'. The state of the entire system at a discrete time step $t$ is described by the binary vector $S(t) = (x_1(t), x_2(t), x_3(t))$, where $x_i(t)$ is the state of Gene $i$.\n\nThe network updates its state synchronously, meaning all genes change their state at the same time. The state of a gene at time $t+1$ is determined by the states of the genes at time $t$ according to the following Boolean functions:\n*   $x_1(t+1) = \\text{NOT } x_3(t)$\n*   $x_2(t+1) = x_1(t)$\n*   $x_3(t+1) = x_2(t)$\n\nIn these rules, the NOT operator inverts the binary value (NOT 0 = 1, NOT 1 = 0).\n\nThe system is initialized at time $t=0$ in the state where all genes are inactive, i.e., the initial state is $(0, 0, 0)$.
