            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique and meaningful solution. It is a standard problem in the analysis of two-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe system of ordinary differential equations is given by\n$$\n\\dot{x} = y\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{y} = -x + \\beta x^{3}\n$$\nwhere $x$ and $y$ are functions of time $t$, $\\dot{x} = \\frac{dx}{dt}$, $\\dot{y} = \\frac{dy}{dt}$, and $\\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a parameter.\n\nFirst, we identify the equilibrium points of the system by setting the time derivatives to zero: $\\dot{x}=0$ and $\\dot{y}=0$.\nSetting $\\dot{x}=0$ gives $y=0$.\nSubstituting $y=0$ into the equation for $\\dot{y}$ gives\n$$\n-x + \\beta x^{3} = 0\n$$\n$$\nx(\\beta x^{2} - 1) = 0\n$$\nThis equation has solutions $x=0$ or $\\beta x^{2} - 1 = 0$.\nThe solution $x=0$ yields the equilibrium point $(0,0)$, which exists for all values of $\\beta$.\nThe second condition, $\\beta x^{2} = 1$, depends on the sign of $\\beta$.\n- If $\\beta \\le 0$, the only real solution for $x$ is $x=0$. Thus, for $\\beta \\le 0$, the system has only one equilibrium point: $(0,0)$.\n- If $\\beta  0$, we have $x^{2} = \\frac{1}{\\beta}$, which gives two additional real solutions: $x = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta}}$ and $x = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta}}$. This results in two more equilibrium points: $(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta}}, 0)$ and $(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta}}, 0)$.\n\nIn summary, the equilibria are:\n- For $\\beta \\le 0$: one equilibrium at $(0,0)$.\n- For $\\beta  0$: three equilibria at $(0,0)$, $(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta}}, 0)$, and $(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta}}, 0)$.\n\nNext, we classify the local stability of each equilibrium by analyzing the Jacobian matrix of the vector field $F(x,y) = (y, -x + \\beta x^{3})$. The Jacobian matrix $J$ is\n$$\nJ(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial \\dot{x}}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial \\dot{x}}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\dot{y}}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial \\dot{y}}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ -1 + 3\\beta x^{2}  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe evaluate $J$ at each equilibrium point.\n1.  At the equilibrium $(0,0)$:\n    $$\n    J(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ -1  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    The eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are found from the characteristic equation $\\det(J - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n    $$\n    (-\\lambda)(-\\lambda) - (1)(-1) = \\lambda^{2} + 1 = 0\n    $$\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_{1,2} = \\pm i$. Since the eigenvalues are purely imaginary and non-zero, the linearized system has a center. For a Hamiltonian system, this suggests that the full nonlinear system has a center at the origin.\n\n2.  At the equilibria $(\\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta}}, 0)$ for $\\beta  0$:\n    The value of the term $-1 + 3\\beta x^{2}$ is the same for both points:\n    $$\n    -1 + 3\\beta \\left( \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta}} \\right)^{2} = -1 + 3\\beta \\left( \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\right) = -1 + 3 = 2\n    $$\n    So, the Jacobian matrix at these points is\n    $$\n    J\\left(\\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta}}, 0\\right) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 2  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    The characteristic equation is $\\lambda^{2} - 2 = 0$, which gives the eigenvalues $\\lambda_{1,2} = \\pm \\sqrt{2}$. Since the eigenvalues are real and have opposite signs, these two equilibria are saddle points. According to the Hartman-Grobman theorem, the local phase portrait of the nonlinear system near these points is qualitatively equivalent to that of the linearized system.\n\nNow, we derive a conserved quantity $H(x,y)$. The system has the form of a Hamiltonian system, where $\\dot{x} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y}$ and $\\dot{y} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x}$.\nFrom $\\dot{x} = y = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y}$, we integrate with respect to $y$, holding $x$ constant:\n$$\nH(x,y) = \\int y \\, dy = \\frac{1}{2}y^{2} + f(x)\n$$\nwhere $f(x)$ is an arbitrary function of integration.\nNext, we use the second equation, $\\dot{y} = -x + \\beta x^{3} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x} = \\frac{d f(x)}{dx} = -(-x + \\beta x^{3}) = x - \\beta x^{3}\n$$\nIntegrating this with respect to $x$ gives:\n$$\nf(x) = \\int (x - \\beta x^{3}) \\, dx = \\frac{1}{2}x^{2} - \\frac{\\beta}{4}x^{4} + C\n$$\nSetting the constant of integration $C$ to $0$ for simplicity, we obtain the Hamiltonian function:\n$$\nH(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2}y^{2} + \\frac{1}{2}x^{2} - \\frac{\\beta}{4}x^{4}\n$$\nTo confirm it is a conserved quantity, we compute its total time derivative along a trajectory:\n$$\n\\frac{dH}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x}\\dot{x} + \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y}\\dot{y} = (x - \\beta x^{3})(y) + (y)(-x + \\beta x^{3}) = xy - \\beta x^{3}y - xy + \\beta x^{3}y = 0\n$$\nSince $\\frac{dH}{dt}=0$, $H(x,y)$ is constant along any trajectory of the system. The trajectories are the level sets of $H(x,y)$. The term $V(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^2 - \\frac{\\beta}{4}x^4$ acts as a potential energy. Equilibria correspond to critical points of $V(x)$, and their stability is determined by whether these critical points are minima or maxima of the potential. For $\\beta  0$, $x=0$ is a local minimum of $V(x)$, corresponding to the center, and $x = \\pm 1/\\sqrt{\\beta}$ are local maxima, corresponding to the saddles.\n\nFor $\\beta  0$, the phase portrait features a heteroclinic separatrix connecting the two saddle points at $(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta}}, 0)$ and $(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta}}, 0)$. To find the value of the conserved quantity on this separatrix, denoted $H_{s}(\\beta)$, we evaluate $H(x,y)$ at either of the saddle points, as they must lie on this level set. Using the point $(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta}}, 0)$:\n$$\nH_{s}(\\beta) = H\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta}}, 0\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(0)^{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta}}\\right)^{2} - \\frac{\\beta}{4}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta}}\\right)^{4}\n$$\n$$\nH_{s}(\\beta) = 0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\beta}\\right) - \\frac{\\beta}{4}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\beta^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2\\beta} - \\frac{1}{4\\beta} = \\frac{2-1}{4\\beta} = \\frac{1}{4\\beta}\n$$\nThis is the conserved energy value on the separatrix loop for $\\beta  0$.\n\nFinally, we discuss the qualitative change in dynamics with the sign of $\\beta$.\n- For $\\beta  0$, the potential energy is $V(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^{2} - \\frac{\\beta}{4}x^{4} = \\frac{1}{2}x^{2} + \\frac{|\\beta|}{4}x^{4}$. This potential has a single global minimum at $x=0$ and grows unboundedly as $|x| \\to \\infty$. Consequently, the phase portrait consists of nested closed orbits surrounding the single equilibrium point $(0,0)$, which is a center. All motion is bounded and periodic. The entire phase plane is the \"basin\" for this bounded motion.\n\n- For $\\beta  0$, the potential energy $V(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^{2} - \\frac{\\beta}{4}x^{4}$ has a local minimum at $x=0$ and two local maxima at $x = \\pm 1/\\sqrt{\\beta}$. It is a double-well potential that tends to $-\\infty$ as $|x| \\to \\infty$. This structure changes the phase portrait topology dramatically. The local minimum at the origin corresponds to a center surrounded by a family of closed, periodic orbits for energy levels $0  H  H_s(\\beta)$. The separatrix at $H=H_s(\\beta)$ encloses this region of bounded motion. For $H  H_s(\\beta)$, trajectories are unbounded. The existence of the separatrix creates a finite basin for bounded (and in the presence of damping, stable) motion around the origin.\n\nThe transition at $\\beta=0$ is a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation. If we consider a weakly dissipative system (e.g., by adding a term $-\\gamma \\dot{y}$ to the $\\ddot{x}$ equation, with $\\gamma  0$), the dynamics change:\n- For $\\beta  0$, the origin is a stable spiral, the sole attractor.\n- For $\\beta  0$, the origin becomes a saddle, and the two nonzero equilibria become stable spirals (attractors). The stable manifold of the saddle at the origin now acts as the basin boundary separating the two new attractors.\nIf $\\beta$ is slowly increased from a negative to a positive value, a system initially at rest at the origin will find itself at an unstable point once $\\beta0$ and will be forced to transition to one of the two new stable states. This abrupt change in long-term behavior is a direct consequence of the bifurcation and the change in phase portrait topology, where the appearance of the separatrix (in the conservative limit) marks the creation of new basins of attraction.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is a well-posed exercise in the application of center manifold theory to analyze a local bifurcation in a two-dimensional dynamical system. It is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and objective. All provided data and conditions are consistent and sufficient for a rigorous derivation. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be presented.\n\nThe system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) is given by:\n$$\n\\dot{x} = y\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{y} = -\\lambda y + \\mu + b x^{2} + \\mathcal{O}(\\|(x,y,\\mu)\\|^{3})\n$$\nwhere $x$ and $y$ are state variables, $\\mu$ is a parameter, and $\\lambda  0$, $b  0$ are constants.\n\nFirst, we verify that the equilibrium at $(x,y,\\mu)=(0,0,0)$ is nonhyperbolic. We linearize the system around this point by computing the Jacobian matrix of the vector field $F(x,y) = (y, -\\lambda y + b x^{2})$ at $(x,y)=(0,0)$ (setting $\\mu=0$ for the linearization at the bifurcation point):\n$$\nJ = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial \\dot{x}}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial \\dot{x}}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\dot{y}}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial \\dot{y}}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} \\Bigg|_{(0,0)} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 2bx  -\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} \\Bigg|_{(0,0)} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 0  -\\lambda \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues $k$ of the Jacobian are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(J - kI) = 0$:\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} -k  1 \\\\ 0  -\\lambda - k \\end{pmatrix} = (-k)(-\\lambda - k) = k(k+\\lambda) = 0\n$$\nThe eigenvalues are $k_1 = 0$ and $k_2 = -\\lambda$. Since $\\lambda  0$, we have one eigenvalue with a zero real part and one eigenvalue with a negative real part. By definition, an equilibrium is nonhyperbolic if its linearization has at least one eigenvalue with a zero real part. This condition is met, confirming the equilibrium is nonhyperbolic.\n\nThe center subspace, $E^c$, is the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue $k_1=0$. An eigenvector $v_c = (v_1, v_2)^T$ satisfies $(J-0I)v_c=0$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 0  -\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\implies v_2 = 0\n$$\nThus, the center subspace is spanned by the vector $(1,0)^T$ and corresponds to the $x$-axis: $E^c = \\mathrm{span}\\{(1,0)^T\\}$.\n\nThe stable subspace, $E^s$, is the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue $k_2=-\\lambda$. An eigenvector $v_s = (v_1, v_2)^T$ satisfies $(J-(-\\lambda)I)v_s=0$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda  1 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\implies \\lambda v_1 + v_2 = 0 \\implies v_2 = -\\lambda v_1\n$$\nThus, the stable subspace is spanned by the vector $(1,-\\lambda)^T$: $E^s = \\mathrm{span}\\{(1,-\\lambda)^T\\}$.\n\nNext, we derive the center manifold, which is a curve $y=h(x,\\mu)$ that is tangent to the center subspace $E^c$ at the origin for $\\mu=0$. This tangency condition implies $h(0,0)=0$ and $\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x}(0,0)=0$. The center manifold must be invariant under the flow of the ODE system. Assuming $\\mu$ is a slowly varying parameter, we treat it as constant ($\\dot{\\mu}=0$) for the fast dynamics. The invariance condition is $\\frac{d}{dt}h(x(t),\\mu) = \\dot{y}(t)$. Using the chain rule, this becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x}\\dot{x} = \\dot{y}\n$$\nSubstituting the ODEs and $y=h(x,\\mu)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x} (h(x,\\mu)) = -\\lambda h(x,\\mu) + \\mu + b x^{2} + \\mathcal{O}(3)\n$$\nWe propose an ansatz for $h(x,\\mu)$ that is consistent with the powers of variables in the ODE and the tangency conditions. The lowest-order terms driving the dynamics are $x^2$ and $\\mu$. This suggests an ansatz of the form $h(x,\\mu) = A\\mu + Bx^2 + \\text{higher order terms}$. The tangency conditions are satisfied by this form. Substituting this into the invariance equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(A\\mu + Bx^2 + \\dots)(A\\mu + Bx^2 + \\dots) = -\\lambda (A\\mu + Bx^2 + \\dots) + \\mu + bx^2 + \\dots\n$$\n$$\n(2Bx + \\dots)(A\\mu + Bx^2 + \\dots) = (1-\\lambda A)\\mu + (b-\\lambda B)x^2 + \\dots\n$$\nExpanding the left side gives $2ABx\\mu + 2B^2x^3 + \\dots$, which contains only terms of order three or higher in $(x,\\mu)$. We match coefficients of the lowest order terms ($\\mu$ and $x^2$) on both sides of the equation:\nCoefficient of $\\mu$: $0 = 1 - \\lambda A \\implies A = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}$.\nCoefficient of $x^2$: $0 = b - \\lambda B \\implies B = \\frac{b}{\\lambda}$.\nThus, the center manifold to the lowest nontrivial order is given by:\n$$\ny = h(x,\\mu) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\mu + \\frac{b}{\\lambda}x^2\n$$\n\nThe dynamics on this center manifold are obtained by substituting this expression for $y$ into the equation for $\\dot{x}$:\n$$\n\\dot{x} = y = h(x,\\mu) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}(\\mu + bx^2)\n$$\nThis is the reduced one-dimensional dynamical system that governs the behavior of $x$ near the origin.\n\nTo determine the stability of the origin at $\\mu=0$, we set $\\mu=0$ in the reduced equation:\n$$\n\\dot{x} = \\frac{b}{\\lambda}x^2\n$$\nSince $b0$ and $\\lambda0$, the coefficient $\\frac{b}{\\lambda}$ is positive. For any $x \\neq 0$, $\\dot{x}0$. This means that for $x(0)0$, $x(t)$ increases, moving away from the origin. For $x(0)0$, $x(t)$ also increases, moving towards the origin. This type of equilibrium is known as half-stable (or semi-stable). It is unstable in the Lyapunov sense because trajectories starting arbitrarily close to the right of the origin will leave any neighborhood of the origin.\n\nNow we analyze the case for $\\mu0$ and sufficiently small. The fixed points of the reduced flow are given by $\\dot{x}=0$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda}(\\mu + bx^2) = 0 \\implies bx^2 = -\\mu \\implies x = \\pm\\sqrt{-\\frac{\\mu}{b}}\n$$\nSince $\\mu0$, $-\\mu0$ and two real fixed points exist: $x^*_+ = \\sqrt{-\\frac{\\mu}{b}}$ and $x^*_- = -\\sqrt{-\\frac{\\mu}{b}}$. To determine their stability, we examine the sign of the derivative of the vector field $f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}(\\mu+bx^2)$ at these points:\n$$\nf'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}f(x) = \\frac{2b}{\\lambda}x\n$$\nAt $x^*_-$: $f'(x^*_-) = \\frac{2b}{\\lambda}\\left(-\\sqrt{-\\frac{\\mu}{b}}\\right)  0$, so $x^*_-$ is a stable equilibrium (an attractor).\nAt $x^*_+$: $f'(x^*_+) = \\frac{2b}{\\lambda}\\left(\\sqrt{-\\frac{\\mu}{b}}\\right)  0$, so $x^*_+$ is an unstable equilibrium (a repeller).\n\nThe basin of attraction for the stable equilibrium $x^*_-$ is the set of initial conditions $x(0)$ for which the trajectory $x(t)$ converges to $x^*_-$ as $t \\to \\infty$. The phase line portrait shows that for any $x(0)  x^*_+$, the trajectory will converge to $x^*_-$. The unstable fixed point $x^*_+$ acts as a separatrix, or a basin boundary. Trajectories starting at $x(0)x^*_+$ diverge. Therefore, the local basin of attraction is the interval $(-\\infty, x^*_+)$, and its boundary is located at the unstable fixed point $x_{\\mathrm{b}}(\\mu) = x^*_+$.\n$$\nx_{\\mathrm{b}}(\\mu) = \\sqrt{-\\frac{\\mu}{b}}\n$$\n\nFinally, we discuss hysteresis. The bifurcation occurring at $\\mu=0$ is a saddle-node bifurcation. As the parameter $\\mu$ is slowly increased from a negative value, the system state tracks the stable equilibrium $x^*_-(\\mu)$. At $\\mu=0$, this stable equilibrium collides with the unstable one, $x^*_+(\\mu)$, and they both disappear. For $\\mu0$, there are no more equilibria near the origin, and the dynamics $\\dot{x} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}(\\mu+bx^2)$ are always positive, causing the state $x$ to be rapidly repelled from the origin towards a different, distant attractor. If $\\mu$ is then decreased, the system will not return to the original branch of equilibria as soon as $\\mu$ becomes negative. The pair of equilibria reappears at $\\mu=0$, but the system state is far away. It will only return to the stable branch $x^*_-$ if it is perturbed into its basin of attraction. This dependence of the system's state on the history of the parameter variation is the hallmark of hysteresis. The system \"jumps up\" at $\\mu=0$ but does not \"jump down\" at the same point, creating a loop in the state-vs-parameter plot.\n\nThe problem asks for the expression for the basin boundary location $x_{\\mathrm{b}}(\\mu)$ for $\\mu0$. This is given by the position of the unstable fixed point.",

The force is derived from the potential:\n$$\n-V'(x) \\;=\\; -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(\\frac{1}{4}x^{4}\\;-\\;\\frac{1}{2}x^{2}\\right) \\;=\\; -(x^3-x) \\;=\\; x - x^3\n$$\nThe fixed points (or equilibria) of the deterministic system are the roots of $V'(x)=0$:\n$$\nx^3 - x = x(x^2 - 1) = x(x-1)(x+1) = 0\n$$\nThis gives three fixed points: $x_1 = -1$, $x_2 = 0$, and $x_3 = 1$.\n\nThe stability of these fixed points is determined by the sign of the second derivative of the potential, $V''(x)$. A positive second derivative indicates a local minimum (stable fixed point), while a negative second derivative indicates a local maximum (unstable fixed point).\n$$\nV''(x) \\;=\\; \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 V}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} \\;=\\; 3x^2 - 1\n$$\nWe evaluate $V''(x)$ at each fixed point:\n- At $x = -1$: $V''(-1) = 3(-1)^2 - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2  0$. This is a stable fixed point (a local potential minimum). Let us denote this point as $x_{min,L}$.\n- At $x = 1$: $V''(1) = 3(1)^2 - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2  0$. This is also a stable fixed point (a local potential minimum). Let us denote this point as $x_{min,R}$.\n- At $x = 0$: $V''(0) = 3(0)^2 - 1 = -1  0$. This is an unstable fixed point (a local potential maximum), which acts as a barrier separating the two stable states. Let us denote this point as $x_{sad}$.\n\nThe system has two basins of attraction corresponding to the potential wells centered at $x_{min,L} = -1$ and $x_{min,R} = 1$. The problem asks for the escape rate from the left basin (around $x=-1$) to the right basin. This transition occurs when noise fluctuations provide sufficient energy for the system to surmount the potential barrier at $x_{sad} = 0$.\n\nIn the small-noise limit ($\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0^+$), the escape rate is governed by the Eyring-Kramers law. This law is a cornerstone of transition state theory and is derived from a leading-order asymptotic analysis of the mean first passage time problem for the Fokker-Planck equation associated with the SDE. For a one-dimensional system, the escape rate $k$ from a potential well at $x_{min}$ over a barrier at $x_{sad}$ is given by:\n$$\nk \\;=\\; \\frac{\\sqrt{V''(x_{min}) |V''(x_{sad})|}}{2\\pi} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta V}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta V = V(x_{sad}) - V(x_{min})$ is the height of the potential barrier relative to the minimum.\n\nWe now compute the necessary quantities for our specific problem. The escape is from the left well at $x_{min,L} = -1$ over the saddle at $x_{sad} = 0$.\nThe values of the potential at these points are:\n$$\nV(x_{min,L}) = V(-1) = \\frac{1}{4}(-1)^4 - \\frac{1}{2}(-1)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{2} = -\\frac{1}{4}\n$$\n$$\nV(x_{sad}) = V(0) = \\frac{1}{4}(0)^4 - \\frac{1}{2}(0)^2 = 0\n$$\nThe potential barrier height is therefore:\n$$\n\\Delta V = V(x_{sad}) - V(x_{min,L}) = 0 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\nThe curvatures (second derivatives of the potential) at the minimum and the saddle have already been calculated:\n$$\nV''(x_{min,L}) = V''(-1) = 2\n$$\n$$\nV''(x_{sad}) = V''(0) = -1\n$$\nNow, we substitute these values into the Eyring-Kramers formula to find the escape rate $k(\\varepsilon)$:\n$$\nk(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{\\sqrt{(2)|-1|}}{2\\pi} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1/4}{\\varepsilon}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2\\pi} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{4\\varepsilon}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the leading-order asymptotic expression for the escape rate from the basin at $x=-1$ in the limit of small noise intensity $\\varepsilon \\to 0^{+}$.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the relation between this rate and the expected residence time. In the small-noise limit, escape events are rare and can be modeled as a Poisson process. The rate of this process is the escape rate $k$. For a Poisson process with rate $k$, the waiting time for the first event follows an exponential distribution with mean $\\tau$. This mean waiting time, $\\tau$, is the expected residence time in the basin. The relationship is simply:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{1}{k}\n$$\nTherefore, the expected time the system spends in the left well before escaping is the reciprocal of the rate $k(\\varepsilon)$. The problem asks specifically for the escape rate $k(\\varepsilon)$.",
