The significance of the algebraic connectivity $\\lambda_{2}$ is explicit: larger $\\lambda_{2}$ lowers $\\sigma_{\\min} = \\alpha_{\\ell}/\\lambda_{2}$, making synchronization achievable at weaker coupling; conversely, the small $\\lambda_{2}$ of a path graph requires stronger coupling to cross the MSF stability threshold.\n\nThus, the exact minimal coupling is\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\min} = \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}.\n$$",

Each node has scalar state $x_i(n) \\in [0,1]$ and intrinsic dynamics given by the logistic map $f(x) = r x (1 - x)$, where $r  0$ is the logistic parameter. The coupling uses the identity coupling function $h(x) = x$ with strength $\\sigma \\ge 0$, and the network is encoded by an adjacency matrix $A$ with graph Laplacian $L = D - A$, where $D$ is the diagonal degree matrix. The synchronous solution is the state where $x_i(n) = s(n)$ for all $i$, and the concept of the Master Stability Function (MSF) is used to determine its linear stability.

            "solution": "The analysis of synchronization stability for the network of coupled logistic maps proceeds via the Master Stability Function (MSF) formalism. The core of this method involves linearizing the system's dynamics around the desired synchronous solution and analyzing the growth or decay of perturbations in the eigenmodes of the network's coupling structure.\n\nThe dynamics of the $N$-node network are governed by the set of equations:\n$$x_i(n+1) = f(x_i(n)) - \\sigma \\sum_{j=1}^{N} L_{ij} h(x_j(n)), \\quad i=1, \\dots, N$$\nwhere $x_i(n) \\in [0,1]$ is the state of node $i$ at discrete time $n$. The intrinsic dynamics are given by the logistic map, $f(x) = r x (1-x)$, and the coupling is specified by the function $h(x)=x$, the coupling strength $\\sigma \\ge 0$, and the graph Laplacian $L=D-A$. The matrix $D$ is the diagonal degree matrix and $A$ is the adjacency matrix.\n\nA synchronous solution exists where all nodes evolve identically, $x_i(n) = s(n)$ for all $i$. Substituting this into the system equation, the coupling term $\\sigma \\sum_{j=1}^{N} L_{ij} s(n)$ vanishes because the sum of elements in any row of a Laplacian matrix is zero, i.e., $\\sum_{j} L_{ij} = 0$. Thus, the synchronous trajectory $s(n)$ is governed by the dynamics of a single, uncoupled logistic map:\n$$s(n+1) = f(s(n)) = r s(n) (1 - s(n))$$\nThis trajectory is generated numerically by iterating the map from an initial condition $s(0) \\in (0,1)$.\n\nTo determine the linear stability of this solution, we analyze the evolution of small perturbations, $x_i(n) = s(n) + \\delta_i(n)$. Linearizing the system around the synchronous trajectory $s(n)$ results in a variational equation for the vector of perturbations $\\vec{\\delta}(n) = [\\delta_1(n), \\dots, \\delta_N(n)]^T$:\n$$\\vec{\\delta}(n+1) = \\left[ f'(s(n))I - \\sigma L \\right] \\vec{\\delta}(n)$$\nHere, $f'(s(n)) = r(1-2s(n))$ is the derivative of $f(x)$ evaluated along the synchronous trajectory, and $I$ is the $N \\times N$ identity matrix.\n\nThe problem is simplified by diagonalizing the Laplacian matrix $L$. Since the network adjacency matrix $A$ is symmetric (undirected graph), $L$ is also symmetric and possesses a complete orthonormal set of eigenvectors $\\vec{v}_k$ with corresponding real eigenvalues $0 = \\lambda_1 \\le \\lambda_2 \\le \\dots \\le \\lambda_N$. Any perturbation $\\vec{\\delta}(n)$ can be decomposed in this eigenbasis: $\\vec{\\delta}(n) = \\sum_{k=1}^N c_k(n) \\vec{v}_k$. Substituting this expansion into the variational equation and leveraging the property $L\\vec{v}_k = \\lambda_k \\vec{v}_k$ decouples the $N$-dimensional dynamics into $N$ independent scalar recursions for the mode amplitudes $c_k(n)$:\n$$c_k(n+1) = [f'(s(n)) - \\sigma \\lambda_k] c_k(n)$$\nThe mode corresponding to $\\lambda_1 = 0$ represents a uniform shift of all nodes and lies within the synchronization manifold. The stability of the synchronous state is therefore determined by the transverse modes, corresponding to $k=2, \\dots, N$.\n\nThe Master Stability Function (MSF), $\\Lambda(\\alpha)$, is defined as the largest Lyapunov exponent of the generic one-dimensional variational equation parameterized by a real variable $\\alpha$:\n$$\\eta(n+1) = [f'(s(n)) - \\alpha] \\eta(n)$$\nThe Lyapunov exponent is given by the long-term time average:\n$$\\Lambda(\\alpha) = \\lim_{M \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{n=0}^{M-1} \\ln |f'(s(n)) - \\alpha|$$\nNumerically, we approximate this by generating a long trajectory of $s(n)$ of length $M_{iter}$ after discarding $N_{trans}$ transient steps:\n$$\\Lambda(\\alpha) \\approx \\frac{1}{M_{iter}} \\sum_{n=N_{trans}}^{N_{trans}+M_{iter}-1} \\ln |r(1-2s(n)) - \\alpha|$$\nThe stability of the $k$-th transverse mode is given by the sign of $\\Lambda(\\sigma\\lambda_k)$. The synchronous state is linearly stable if and only if all transverse modes decay, meaning $\\Lambda(\\sigma\\lambda_k)  0$ for all $k \\in \\{2, \\dots, N\\}$.

The solution will be derived based on the provided assumptions and bounds using the Master Stability Function (MSF) framework.\n\nThe dynamics of the $i$-th oscillator in the network are given by:\n$$ \\dot{x}_{i} = f(x_{i}; \\rho_{i}) + \\sigma \\sum_{j=1}^{N} L_{ij} H(x_{j}) $$\nwhere $x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, $f$ is the Lorenz vector field, $\\rho_i = \\rho_0 + \\delta_i$ is the node-specific parameter with nominal value $\\rho_0$ and mismatch $|\\delta_i| \\leq \\Delta$, $\\sigma  0$ is the coupling strength, $L$ is the graph Laplacian, and $H(x) = (x_1, 0, 0)^{\\top}$ is the coupling function.\n\nFor the nominal system ($\\Delta = 0$), there exists a synchronized solution $s(t)$ satisfying $\\dot{s}(t) = f(s(t); \\rho_0)$, since $\\sum_j L_{ij} = 0$.\n\nThe synchronization error for node $i$ is defined as $e_i(t) = x_i(t) - s(t)$. The dynamics of the error can be found by substituting $x_i = s + e_i$ into the evolution equation and linearizing around the synchronous state $s(t)$ (i.e., for small $e_i$).\n$$ \\dot{e}_i = \\dot{x}_i - \\dot{s} = f(s+e_i; \\rho_0+\\delta_i) + \\sigma \\sum_{j=1}^{N} L_{ij} H(s+e_j) - f(s; \\rho_0) $$\nLinearizing $f$ and $H$ yields:\n$$ f(s+e_i; \\rho_0+\\delta_i) \\approx f(s; \\rho_0) + D_x f(s; \\rho_0) e_i + D_\\rho f(s; \\rho_0) \\delta_i $$\n$$ H(s+e_j) = H(s) + DH(s) e_j $$\nwhere $D_x f$ and $D_\\rho f$ are the Jacobians of $f$ with respect to state and parameter, and $DH$ is the Jacobian of $H$. Note that since $H(x)$ is linear, the expansion is exact. Substituting these into the error dynamics and noting that $\\sigma \\sum_j L_{ij} H(s)=0$ gives the linearized error dynamics:\n$$ \\dot{e}_i(t) \\approx D_x f(s(t); \\rho_0) e_i(t) + \\sigma \\sum_{j=1}^{N} L_{ij} DH(s(t)) e_j(t) + D_\\rho f(s(t); \\rho_0) \\delta_i $$\nThis is a set of coupled, non-autonomous linear differential equations with a forcing term arising from the parameter mismatch.\n\nThis system can be decoupled by projecting the errors onto the eigenbasis of the graph Laplacian $L$. Let $\\{v_k\\}_{k=1}^N$ be the eigenvectors of $L$ with corresponding eigenvalues $0 = \\lambda_1  \\lambda_2 \\leq \\dots \\leq \\lambda_N$. The error vector for each node can be expressed as a linear combination of mode variables $\\xi_k(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$. The dynamics of the transverse modes ($k=2, \\dots, N$) are given by:\n$$ \\dot{\\xi}_k(t) = \\left[ D_x f(s(t); \\rho_0) + \\sigma \\lambda_k DH(s(t)) \\right] \\xi_k(t) + F_k(t) $$\nThe term in the square brackets is the variational equation matrix for the nominal system, whose largest Lyapunov exponent is the Master Stability Function $\\Lambda(\\nu)$ evaluated at $\\nu = \\sigma \\lambda_k$. Let this matrix be $A_k(t)$. The term $F_k(t)$ is the projection of the parameter mismatch forcing onto the $k$-th mode. The problem provides a uniform bound on its norm: $\\|F_k(t)\\| \\le G \\Delta$ for some constant $G  0$.\n\nWe have a set of linear time-varying (LTV) systems $\\dot{\\xi}_k(t) = A_k(t) \\xi_k(t) + F_k(t)$. The solution can be written using the state transition matrix $\\Phi_k(t, \\tau)$ associated with $A_k(t)$:\n$$ \\xi_k(t) = \\Phi_k(t, t_0) \\xi_k(t_0) + \\int_{t_0}^t \\Phi_k(t, \\tau) F_k(\\tau) d\\tau $$\nThe problem states that for the stable modes where $\\Lambda(\\sigma \\lambda_k)  0$, the norm of the state transition matrix is bounded by $\\|\\Phi_k(t, \\tau)\\| \\le C \\exp(\\Lambda(\\sigma \\lambda_k)(t-\\tau))$ for $t \\ge \\tau$ and some constant $C \\ge 1$.\n\nFor steady-state analysis, we consider the behavior as $t \\to \\infty$. As $\\Lambda(\\sigma \\lambda_k)  0$, the homogeneous term $\\Phi_k(t, t_0) \\xi_k(t_0)$ decays to zero. The asymptotic bound on the error is determined by the forced response. We can compute an upper bound on the norm of the particular solution by extending the integration interval to $(-\\infty, t]$:\n$$ \\|\\xi_k(t)\\|_{ss} \\le \\int_{-\\infty}^t \\|\\Phi_k(t, \\tau)\\| \\|F_k(\\tau)\\| d\\tau $$\nUsing the given bounds:\n$$ \\|\\xi_k(t)\\|_{ss} \\le \\int_{-\\infty}^t C \\exp(\\Lambda(\\sigma \\lambda_k)(t-\\tau)) (G \\Delta) d\\tau $$\nLet $u = t-\\tau$. The integral becomes:\n$$ \\|\\xi_k(t)\\|_{ss} \\le C G \\Delta \\int_0^\\infty \\exp(\\Lambda(\\sigma \\lambda_k) u) du $$\nSince $\\Lambda(\\sigma \\lambda_k)  0$, the integral converges:\n$$ \\int_0^\\infty \\exp(\\Lambda(\\sigma \\lambda_k) u) du = \\left[ \\frac{\\exp(\\Lambda(\\sigma \\lambda_k) u)}{\\Lambda(\\sigma \\lambda_k)} \\right]_0^\\infty = 0 - \\frac{1}{\\Lambda(\\sigma \\lambda_k)} = \\frac{-1}{\\Lambda(\\sigma \\lambda_k)} $$\nTherefore, the steady-state error for each transverse mode is bounded by:\n$$ \\|\\xi_k\\|_{ss} \\le \\frac{C G \\Delta}{-\\Lambda(\\sigma \\lambda_k)} $$\nThe problem provides an affine approximation for the MSF on its negative branch: $\\Lambda(\\nu) \\approx \\alpha_0 - \\alpha_1 \\nu$ for $\\alpha_0  0$ and $\\alpha_1  0$. Substituting this approximation:\n$$ \\|\\xi_k\\|_{ss} \\le \\frac{C G \\Delta}{-(\\alpha_0 - \\alpha_1 \\sigma \\lambda_k)} = \\frac{C G \\Delta}{\\alpha_1 \\sigma \\lambda_k - \\alpha_0} $$\nThe condition for stability, $\\Lambda(\\sigma\\lambda_k)  0$, ensures the denominator is positive.\n\nThe \"worst-case\" synchronization error corresponds to the largest possible modal error. The bound on $\\|\\xi_k\\|_{ss}$ is maximized when its denominator is minimized. Since the eigenvalues are ordered $\\lambda_2 \\le \\lambda_3 \\le \\dots \\le \\lambda_N$, the term $\\alpha_1 \\sigma \\lambda_k - \\alpha_0$ is minimized for the smallest transverse eigenvalue, $\\lambda_2$. Thus, the bound on the worst-case error is:\n$$ \\max_{k \\ge 2} \\|\\xi_k\\|_{ss} \\le \\frac{C G \\Delta}{\\alpha_1 \\sigma \\lambda_2 - \\alpha_0} $$\nThe problem requires this worst-case error to be no greater than a prescribed tolerance $\\varepsilon$. We impose this condition:\n$$ \\frac{C G \\Delta}{\\alpha_1 \\sigma \\lambda_2 - \\alpha_0} \\le \\varepsilon $$\nWe now solve this inequality for $\\sigma$ to find the sufficient coupling strength.\n$$ C G \\Delta \\le \\varepsilon (\\alpha_1 \\sigma \\lambda_2 - \\alpha_0) $$\n$$ \\frac{C G \\Delta}{\\varepsilon} \\le \\alpha_1 \\sigma \\lambda_2 - \\alpha_0 $$\n$$ \\alpha_0 + \\frac{C G \\Delta}{\\varepsilon} \\le \\alpha_1 \\sigma \\lambda_2 $$\n$$ \\sigma \\ge \\frac{1}{\\alpha_1 \\lambda_2} \\left( \\alpha_0 + \\frac{C G \\Delta}{\\varepsilon} \\right) $$\nThis inequality provides a sufficient lower bound on $\\sigma$. The critical coupling strength $\\sigma_c$ is the minimum value that satisfies this condition.\n$$ \\sigma_c = \\frac{1}{\\alpha_1 \\lambda_2} \\left( \\alpha_0 + \\frac{C G \\Delta}{\\varepsilon} \\right) $$\nThis expression gives the sufficient lower bound on the coupling strength in terms of the given parameters.",
