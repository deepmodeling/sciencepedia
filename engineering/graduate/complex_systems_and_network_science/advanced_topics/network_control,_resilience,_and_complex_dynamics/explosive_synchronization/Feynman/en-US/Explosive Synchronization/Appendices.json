The second part asks for the design of a scientifically sound experimental protocol to study Explosive Synchronization (ES).\n\n### Part 1: Computation of the Order Parameter $r(K^{\\star})$\n\nThe complex Kuramoto order parameter, $z$, is defined as the mean of the phasors representing the individual oscillators on the unit circle in the complex plane:\n$$z = r \\exp(i \\psi) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\exp(i \\theta_{j})$$\nwhere $N$ is the number of oscillators, $\\theta_j$ is the phase of the $j$-th oscillator, $r$ is the magnitude of the order parameter representing the level of phase coherence, and $\\psi$ is the average phase.\n\nThe magnitude $r$ is the modulus of the complex number $z$. We can express $z$ in Cartesian form using Euler's formula, $\\exp(i\\theta) = \\cos(\\theta) + i\\sin(\\theta)$:\n$$z = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} (\\cos(\\theta_j) + i\\sin(\\theta_j))$$\nSeparating the real and imaginary parts:\n$$z = \\left(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\cos(\\theta_j)\\right) + i \\left(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\sin(\\theta_j)\\right)$$\nLet $X = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\cos(\\theta_j)$ and $Y = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\sin(\\theta_j)$. Then $z = X + iY$. The magnitude $r$ is given by:\n$$r = |z| = \\sqrt{X^2 + Y^2}$$\nWe are given $N=10$ and the set of phases (in radians):\n$\\{ \\theta_{j} \\}_{j=1}^{10} = \\{ 0.02,\\ 0.05,\\ -0.03,\\ 0.04,\\ -0.01,\\ 0.00,\\ 3.10,\\ -3.12,\\ 3.08,\\ -3.09 \\}$\n\nFirst, we compute the sum of cosines:\n$$ \\sum_{j=1}^{10} \\cos(\\theta_j) = \\cos(0.02) + \\cos(0.05) + \\cos(-0.03) + \\cos(0.04) + \\cos(-0.01) + \\cos(0.00) + \\cos(3.10) + \\cos(-3.12) + \\cos(3.08) + \\cos(-3.09) $$\nSince $\\cos(-x) = \\cos(x)$, this is:\n$$ \\sum_{j=1}^{10} \\cos(\\theta_j) = \\cos(0.02) + \\cos(0.05) + \\cos(0.03) + \\cos(0.04) + \\cos(0.01) + \\cos(0) + \\cos(3.10) + \\cos(3.12) + \\cos(3.08) + \\cos(3.09) $$\nUsing a calculator for the values (in radians):\n$$ \\sum \\cos(\\theta_j) \\approx 0.999800 + 0.998750 + 0.999550 + 0.999200 + 0.999950 + 1.000000 - 0.999135 - 0.999712 - 0.998295 - 0.998715 \\approx 2.001393 $$\nSo, $X = \\frac{2.001393}{10} = 0.2001393$.\n\nNext, we compute the sum of sines:\n$$ \\sum_{j=1}^{10} \\sin(\\theta_j) = \\sin(0.02) + \\sin(0.05) + \\sin(-0.03) + \\sin(0.04) + \\sin(-0.01) + \\sin(0.00) + \\sin(3.10) + \\sin(-3.12) + \\sin(3.08) + \\sin(-3.09) $$\nSince $\\sin(-x) = -\\sin(x)$, this is:\n$$ \\sum_{j=1}^{10} \\sin(\\theta_j) = \\sin(0.02) + \\sin(0.05) - \\sin(0.03) + \\sin(0.04) - \\sin(0.01) + \\sin(0) + \\sin(3.10) - \\sin(3.12) + \\sin(3.08) - \\sin(3.09) $$\nUsing a calculator for the values (in radians):\n$$ \\sum \\sin(\\theta_j) \\approx 0.019999 + 0.049979 - 0.029996 + 0.039989 - 0.009999 + 0.000000 + 0.041581 - 0.023999 + 0.058374 - 0.050682 \\approx 0.095246 $$\nSo, $Y = \\frac{0.095246}{10} = 0.0095246$.\n\nNow, we compute $r$:\n$$ r = \\sqrt{(0.2001393)^2 + (0.0095246)^2} \\approx \\sqrt{0.04005574 + 0.00009072} = \\sqrt{0.04014646} \\approx 0.2003658 $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we obtain:\n$$ r(K^{\\star}) \\approx 0.2004 $$\nThe value is dimensionless, as required.\n\n### Part 2: Protocol Design for Investigating Explosive Synchronization\n\nExplosive Synchronization (ES) is characterized by a first-order (discontinuous) phase transition and an associated hysteresis loop in the order parameter $r$ as a function of the coupling strength $K$. The protocol must be designed to reveal these two features.\n\n**Protocol Design**\n\n1.  **System Preparation:**\n    - Construct a network of $N$ phase oscillators with a given topology (e.g., scale-free, which promotes ES).\n    - For each oscillator $j$, assign a natural frequency $\\omega_j$ and determine its network degree $k_j$.\n    - To induce ES, enforce a positive correlation between the magnitude of the natural frequencies and the degrees. A common implementation is to set $|\\omega_j|$ to be a monotonically increasing function of $k_j$, e.g., $|\\omega_j| = a k_j$ for some constant $a > 0$. The signs of $\\omega_j$ can be chosen randomly. This setup is crucial, as it is a primary mechanism for ES in oscillator networks.\n\n2.  **Forward (Upward) Coupling Sweep:**\n    - **Initialization:** Begin with the system in an incoherent state by setting the coupling strength to a very low value, $K_{start}$, where $K_{start} \\approx 0$. Initial phases $\\{\\theta_j\\}$ can be chosen randomly from $[0, 2\\pi)$.\n    - **Quasi-static Incrementation:** Increase the coupling strength $K$ in small, fixed steps, $\\Delta K$. The new coupling is $K \\leftarrow K + \\Delta K$. The step size $\\Delta K$ must be small enough to resolve the transition sharply.\n    - **Equilibration:** After each increment, numerically integrate the equations of motion (e.g., using a Runge-Kutta method) for a sufficiently long equilibration time, $T_{equil}$. This allows the system to relax to its new steady state corresponding to the updated coupling $K$.\n    - **Measurement:** Once the system has equilibrated, compute the time-averaged order parameter, $\\langle r \\rangle$, over a subsequent measurement window, $T_{meas}$. Store the pair $(K, \\langle r \\rangle)$.\n    - **Iteration:** Repeat the increment-equilibrate-measure cycle until a maximum coupling $K_{end}$ is reached, where the system is expected to be in a fully synchronized state ($\\langle r \\rangle \\approx 1$).\n\n3.  **Backward (Downward) Coupling Sweep:**\n    - **Initialization:** Starting from the synchronized state at $K = K_{end}$, begin the backward process.\n    - **Quasi-static Decrementation:** Decrease the coupling strength $K$ in the same small steps, $\\Delta K$: $K \\leftarrow K - \\Delta K$.\n    - **Equilibration and Measurement:** At each step, perform the same equilibration ($T_{equil}$) and measurement ($T_{meas}$) procedures as in the forward sweep. Store the pair $(K, \\langle r \\rangle)$.\n    - **Iteration:** Repeat this cycle until the coupling returns to the starting value $K_{start}$.\n\n**Justification from First Principles**\n\n- **Quasi-static Process:** Phase transitions are equilibrium phenomena. A quasi-static sweep (small $\\Delta K$, large $T_{equil}$) ensures that the system's trajectory in the $(K, r)$ plane remains close to the succession of equilibrium (or statistical steady) states. Near a transition point, systems exhibit \"critical slowing down,\" where relaxation times diverge. Therefore, $T_{equil}$ must be particularly long in the vicinity of the expected thresholds to obtain accurate results and avoid artificially shifting the transition points.\n\n- **Positive Degree-Frequency Correlation ($|\\omega_j| \\propto k_j$):** This is the core mechanism. In the standard Kuramoto model (uncorrelated $\\omega_j$ and $k_j$), synchronization emerges gradually as hubs (high-$k_j$ nodes) entrain their neighbors, leading to a continuous, second-order transition. With the positive correlation, hubs have the highest frequency detuning, making them the most resistant to synchronization. They remain desynchronized while smaller-degree nodes form a synchronized cluster. This suppresses the gradual growth of $r$. The system remains largely incoherent until the coupling $K$ is strong enough to overcome the large frequency mismatch of the hubs all at once. At a critical threshold $K_f$, the hubs are abruptly pulled into the synchronized cluster, causing a discontinuous jump in $r$.\n\n- **Hysteresis:** The jump to a high-$r$ state is irreversible over the same path. In the synchronized state (for $K > K_f$), the effective coupling felt by each oscillator is proportional to $Kr$. Because $r$ is now large, this feedback mechanism helps maintain synchrony even when $K$ is decreased below $K_f$. The synchronized state remains stable until $K$ is reduced to a much lower backward threshold, $K_b < K_f$, at which point the coupling term is no longer sufficient to contain the frequency dispersion, and the system abruptly desynchronizes, with $r$ dropping to a small value. This history dependence of the state creates a hysteresis loop. The region $K_b < K < K_f$ is a bistable region where both the incoherent and the synchronized states are stable attractors.\n\n**Operational Identification of Thresholds**\n\nFrom the data collected in the forward and backward sweeps, plot $\\langle r \\rangle$ versus $K$.\n- **Forward Threshold ($K_f$):** This is identified on the curve from the forward sweep. It is the value of $K$ at which the most abrupt increase in $\\langle r \\rangle$ occurs. Operationally, it is found by locating the maximum of the numerical derivative $d\\langle r \\rangle / dK$.\n- **Backward Threshold ($K_b$):** This is identified on the curve from the backward sweep. It is the value of $K$ at which the most abrupt decrease in $\\langle r \\rangle$ occurs. Operationally, it corresponds to the maximum negative value (or minimum) of the derivative $d\\langle r \\rangle / dK$.\n\nThe presence of a region where the forward and backward curves do not overlap, forming a loop ($K_f > K_b$), is the definitive empirical evidence of hysteresis and a first-order phase transition, confirming the phenomenon of Explosive Synchronization.",

For each case, output the list of those $K$ values (rounded to three decimal places) where both an increasing-$K$ branch and a decreasing-$K$ branch yield distinct nontrivial solutions for $r$.\n\n- Case 1 (anticipated explosive synchronization):\n  - Degree distribution exponent: $\\gamma = 2.6$\n  - Degree range: $k_{\\min} = 1.0$, $k_{\\max} = 100.0$\n  - Frequency-degree correlation: $\\alpha = 1.0$, $b = 0.0$\n  - Coupling strengths: $K \\in \\{0.20, 0.30, 0.40, 0.50, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 1.00, 1.10, 1.20, 1.30, 1.40, 1.50, 1.60, 1.70, 1.80\\}$\n\n- Case 2 (weaker correlation, expected continuous onset):\n  - Degree distribution exponent: $\\gamma = 2.6$\n  - Degree range: $k_{\\min} = 1.0$, $k_{\\max} = 100.0$\n  - Frequency-degree correlation: $\\alpha = 0.2$, $b = 0.0$\n  - Coupling strengths: $K$ identical to Case 1\n\n- Case 3 (small coupling, expected no locking):\n  - Degree distribution exponent: $\\gamma = 2.6$\n  - Degree range: $k_{\\min} = 1.0$, $k_{\\max} = 100.0$\n  - Frequency-degree correlation: $\\alpha = 1.0$, $b = 0.0$\n  - Coupling strengths: $K \\in \\{0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.10\\}$\n\nYour program must:\n- Derive and implement the stationary self-consistency conditions for $r$ and $\\Omega$ implied by the annealed mean-field and the locked set criterion $|\\omega - \\Omega| \\le K k r$ under $P(k,\\omega) = P(k) \\delta(\\omega - \\alpha k - b)$.\n- Use a numerical discretization of $k$ to evaluate the required integrals and solve for $(r,\\Omega)$ by fixed-point iteration or root-finding for each $K$ along both increasing and decreasing sequences.\n- Determine, for each case, the set of $K$ values where multiple solutions coexist, defined as having two distinct nontrivial solutions for $r(K)$ obtained from the two branches at the same $K$ (i.e., $|r_{\\uparrow}(K) - r_{\\downarrow}(K)|$ exceeds a small tolerance and both are greater than a small threshold).\n- Produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, with each case reported as a list of the $K$ values with coexistence, rounded to three decimal places. For example, the output format must be exactly like: \"[[0.900,1.000],[...],[...]]\".",
            "solution": "We begin from the Kuramoto model on a network under the annealed mean-field approximation. The microscopic dynamics of oscillator $i$ is given by $\\frac{d\\theta_i}{dt} = \\omega_i + K \\sum_j A_{ij} \\sin(\\theta_j - \\theta_i)$, where $A_{ij}$ is the adjacency matrix, $K$ is the coupling strength, and $\\omega_i$ is the intrinsic frequency. Under the annealed mean-field approximation, the interaction term is replaced by its expected value for nodes of degree $k_i$, yielding $\\frac{d\\theta_i}{dt} = \\omega_i - K k_i r \\sin(\\theta_i - \\psi)$, where the order parameter $r e^{i\\psi} = \\frac{1}{\\langle k \\rangle} \\sum_j k_j e^{i\\theta_j}$, and $\\langle k \\rangle$ is the mean degree.\n\nIn a steady state, we move to a rotating frame with frequency $\\Omega = \\dot{\\psi}$, and consider $\\phi_i = \\theta_i - \\psi$. The dynamics becomes $\\frac{d\\phi_i}{dt} = \\omega_i - \\Omega - K k_i r \\sin \\phi_i$. Stationarity allows two classes: locked oscillators with $\\frac{d\\phi}{dt} = 0$ satisfying $|\\omega - \\Omega| \\le K k r$, and drifting oscillators with $|\\omega - \\Omega|  K k r$. For locked oscillators, the stationary phase satisfies $\\sin \\phi^* = \\frac{\\omega - \\Omega}{K k r}$ and contributes $\\cos \\phi^* = \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{\\omega - \\Omega}{K k r}\\right)^2}$ to the real part of the order parameter. For drifting oscillators, their phase distribution is generally nonuniform; however, in the standard annealed mean-field stationary treatment, the drifting contributions average to zero in the real part when symmetric around $\\Omega$, or are negligible under strong locking, and the imaginary part condition enforces balance for the locked set.\n\nFor a population described by the joint distribution $P(k,\\omega)$, the order parameter $r$ and the stationarity of the imaginary part are determined by integrals over the locked set. Let the locked set be $S = \\{(k,\\omega): |\\omega - \\Omega| \\le K k r\\}$. Then, using the definition $r = \\frac{1}{\\langle k \\rangle} \\int k \\cos \\phi^* \\, P(k,\\omega) \\,\\mathrm{d}k \\,\\mathrm{d}\\omega$, and enforcing that the imaginary part vanishes (equivalently, the average $\\sin \\phi^*$ weighted by $k$ is zero), we obtain the self-consistency conditions:\n$$\nr = \\frac{1}{\\langle k \\rangle} \\int\\!\\!\\int_{S} k \\, P(k,\\omega) \\, \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{\\omega - \\Omega}{K k r}\\right)^2} \\, \\mathrm{d}k \\, \\mathrm{d}\\omega,\n$$\n$$\n0 = \\int\\!\\!\\int_{S} k \\, P(k,\\omega) \\, \\frac{\\omega - \\Omega}{K k r} \\, \\mathrm{d}k \\, \\mathrm{d}\\omega.\n$$\nUnder the specified joint distribution $P(k,\\omega) = P(k) \\delta(\\omega - \\alpha k - b)$, these reduce by evaluating the $\\delta$-function, yielding one-dimensional integrals over $k$. Write $g(k;\\Omega) = \\alpha k + b - \\Omega$ and denote the locked indicator $I(k;r,\\Omega,K) = \\mathbf{1}(|g(k;\\Omega)| \\le K k r)$. The conditions become:\n$$\nr = \\frac{1}{\\langle k \\rangle} \\int_{k_{\\min}}^{k_{\\max}} k \\, P(k) \\, I(k;r,\\Omega,K) \\, \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{g(k;\\Omega)}{K k r}\\right)^2} \\, \\mathrm{d}k,\n$$\n$$\n0 = \\int_{k_{\\min}}^{k_{\\max}} k \\, P(k) \\, I(k;r,\\Omega,K) \\, \\frac{g(k;\\Omega)}{K k r} \\, \\mathrm{d}k.\n$$\nThe second condition simplifies by canceling $k$ in the numerator and denominator:\n$$\n0 = \\int_{k_{\\min}}^{k_{\\max}} P(k) \\, I(k;r,\\Omega,K) \\, (\\alpha k + b - \\Omega) \\, \\mathrm{d}k.\n$$\nDefine normalization and moments for the truncated power-law degree PDF $P(k) = C k^{-\\gamma}$ on $[k_{\\min}, k_{\\max}]$. The normalization constant $C$ and mean $\\langle k \\rangle$ are\n$$\nC = \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{k_{\\min}^{1-\\gamma} - k_{\\max}^{1-\\gamma}}, \\quad \\langle k \\rangle = \\int_{k_{\\min}}^{k_{\\max}} k P(k) \\, \\mathrm{d}k = C \\frac{k_{\\max}^{2 - \\gamma} - k_{\\min}^{2 - \\gamma}}{2 - \\gamma},\n$$\nfor $\\gamma \\neq 1, 2$, which holds in our test suite.\n\nGiven $K$, the pair $(r,\\Omega)$ is found by solving the coupled nonlinear equations above. Numerically, we discretize $k \\in [k_{\\min}, k_{\\max}]$ with a grid $\\{k_m\\}$ and approximate the integrals by Riemann sums or trapezoidal rule. For a given $(r,\\Omega)$, we compute $I_m = \\mathbf{1}(|g(k_m;\\Omega)| \\le K k_m r)$, then\n$$\nA(r,\\Omega,K) = \\sum_m P(k_m) I_m \\Delta k, \\quad B(r,\\Omega,K) = \\sum_m P(k_m) (\\alpha k_m + b) I_m \\Delta k,\n$$\nand the imaginary-part stationarity condition implies $\\Omega = \\frac{B}{A}$ when $A  0$. The real-part condition yields an update for $r$:\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{rhs}}(r,\\Omega,K) = \\frac{1}{\\langle k \\rangle} \\sum_m k_m P(k_m) I_m \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{g(k_m;\\Omega)}{K k_m r}\\right)^2} \\, \\Delta k.\n$$\nWe employ a fixed-point scheme updating $\\Omega \\leftarrow B/A$ and $r \\leftarrow r_{\\mathrm{rhs}}$ with damping until convergence. To reveal possible coexistence of solutions (which signals explosive synchronization), we compute two branches:\n- The increasing-$K$ branch: initialize at small $K$ with a small $r$ and $\\Omega \\approx \\alpha \\langle k \\rangle + b$, then increment $K$ and solve at each step using the previous solution as a warm start.\n- The decreasing-$K$ branch: initialize at large $K$ with $r$ near one and $\\Omega \\approx \\alpha \\langle k \\rangle + b$, solve at each step using the previous solution as a warm start while decrementing $K$.\n\nAt each $K$ in the test set, we compare the solutions $(r_{\\uparrow}(K), \\Omega_{\\uparrow}(K))$ and $(r_{\\downarrow}(K), \\Omega_{\\downarrow}(K))$. If both $r_{\\uparrow}(K)$ and $r_{\\downarrow}(K)$ exceed a small threshold (e.g., $10^{-3}$) and $|r_{\\uparrow}(K) - r_{\\downarrow}(K)|$ exceeds a tolerance (e.g., $2 \\times 10^{-2}$), we declare coexistence for that $K$.\n\nAlgorithmic steps:\n- Construct a uniform grid over $k \\in [k_{\\min}, k_{\\max}]$, compute $P(k_m)$ and $\\langle k \\rangle$ analytically.\n- Implement functions to compute the locked indicator $I_m$, $A$, $B$, and $r_{\\mathrm{rhs}}$.\n- Solve the fixed-point equations for the branches with damping and convergence criteria for each $K$.\n- For each case, collect $K$ values exhibiting coexistence, round to three decimals, and output as a single line containing the three lists for the three cases.\n\nThis procedure tests different facets:\n- Case 1 probes hysteresis and coexistence under strong degree-frequency correlation ($\\alpha = 1.0$) with a heavy-tailed degree distribution ($\\gamma = 2.6$), typical for explosive synchronization.\n- Case 2 examines weakened correlation ($\\alpha = 0.2$), where the onset is expected to be continuous and coexistence absent, validating the algorithm's discrimination.\n- Case 3 tests low coupling strengths where the locked set is empty and $r \\approx 0$ for both branches, ensuring boundary condition handling with no coexistence.\n\nThe final program implements this numerical scheme and prints the required single-line output format: a list of three lists, each containing the $K$ values for the respective case where multiple solutions coexist.",
