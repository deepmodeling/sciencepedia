This exercise will guide you through the core mechanics of the load-capacity model: computing initial loads based on shortest-path betweenness, defining node capacities with a tolerance parameter $\\alpha$, and determining which nodes fail after an initial trigger. By working through this fundamental process (), you will gain a concrete understanding of how load redistribution can lead to subsequent failures.",

The load $L_i$ on node $i$ is defined as the betweenness centrality based on shortest paths: for each unordered pair of distinct nodes $(s,t)$ with $s \\neq i$ and $t \\neq i$, let $\\sigma_{st}$ denote the number of shortest paths between $s$ and $t$, and let $\\sigma_{st}(i)$ denote the number of those shortest paths that pass through node $i$; then\n$$\nL_i \\equiv \\sum_{\\substack{st\\\\ s \\neq i,\\, t \\neq i}} \\frac{\\sigma_{st}(i)}{\\sigma_{st}}.\n$$\nDefine the initial load $L_i^0$ as $L_i$ computed on the full graph $(V,E)$, and the capacity of node $i$ as $C_i = (1 + \\alpha)\\,L_i^0$, where $\\alpha \\geq 0$ is a uniform tolerance parameter.

            "solution": "We begin from the definition of betweenness centrality for load. On the original graph $(V,E)$ with $V = \\{1,2,3,4\\}$ and $E = \\{(1,2),(2,3),(3,4),(4,1),(1,3)\\}$, we compute $L_i^0$ for each node $i$ by enumerating all unordered pairs $(s,t)$ with $s  t$ and $s \\neq i$, $t \\neq i$. The possible unordered pairs are:\n$$\n(1,2),\\ (1,3),\\ (1,4),\\ (2,3),\\ (2,4),\\ (3,4).\n$$\nWe analyze shortest paths for each pair:\n\n- For $(1,2)$, the shortest path length is $1$ via edge $(1,2)$, so there is a single shortest path with no interior node. Thus for any $i$, $\\sigma_{12} = 1$ and $\\sigma_{12}(i) = 0$.\n\n- For $(1,3)$, the diagonal $(1,3)$ gives a shortest path of length $1$. Alternative paths such as $(1,2,3)$ or $(1,4,3)$ have length $2$ and are not shortest. Hence $\\sigma_{13} = 1$ and $\\sigma_{13}(i) = 0$ for all $i$.\n\n- For $(1,4)$, edge $(1,4)$ is a shortest path of length $1$, so $\\sigma_{14} = 1$ and $\\sigma_{14}(i) = 0$ for all $i$.\n\n- For $(2,3)$, edge $(2,3)$ is a shortest path of length $1$, so $\\sigma_{23} = 1$ and $\\sigma_{23}(i) = 0$ for all $i$.\n\n- For $(3,4)$, edge $(3,4)$ is a shortest path of length $1$, so $\\sigma_{34} = 1$ and $\\sigma_{34}(i) = 0$ for all $i$.\n\n- For $(2,4)$, there is no direct edge, and the shortest path length is $2$. There are exactly two distinct shortest paths of length $2$: $(2,3,4)$ and $(2,1,4)$. Therefore $\\sigma_{24} = 2$. For node $1$, exactly one of these two shortest paths, $(2,1,4)$, passes through $1$, so $\\sigma_{24}(1) = 1$. For node $3$, exactly one, $(2,3,4)$, passes through $3$, so $\\sigma_{24}(3) = 1$. For nodes $2$ and $4$, these are endpoints and not counted as interior, so $\\sigma_{24}(2) = 0$ and $\\sigma_{24}(4) = 0$.\n\nSumming the contributions over all pairs for each node $i$, we obtain the initial loads:\n$$\nL_1^0 = \\frac{\\sigma_{24}(1)}{\\sigma_{24}} = \\frac{1}{2},\\quad L_3^0 = \\frac{\\sigma_{24}(3)}{\\sigma_{24}} = \\frac{1}{2},\\quad L_2^0 = 0,\\quad L_4^0 = 0.\n$$\nThus the capacities are\n$$\nC_1 = (1+\\alpha)\\,L_1^0 = \\frac{1+\\alpha}{2},\\quad C_3 = \\frac{1+\\alpha}{2},\\quad C_2 = 0,\\quad C_4 = 0.\n$$\n\nNow we exogenously remove node $3$. The residual graph has node set $\\{1,2,4\\}$ and edge set $\\{(1,2),(1,4)\\}$. This is a path of length $2$ with $1$ as the middle node. We recompute loads $L_i$ on this residual graph using the same shortest-path betweenness definition.\n\nThe unordered pairs among remaining nodes are $(1,2)$, $(1,4)$, and $(2,4)$.\n\n- For $(1,2)$, the shortest path length is $1$ via $(1,2)$, with no interior node. Hence $\\sigma_{12} = 1$ and $\\sigma_{12}(i) = 0$ for all $i$.\n\n- For $(1,4)$, the shortest path length is $1$ via $(1,4)$, with no interior node. Hence $\\sigma_{14} = 1$ and $\\sigma_{14}(i) = 0$ for all $i$.\n\n- For $(2,4)$, there is no direct edge. The unique shortest path is $(2,1,4)$ of length $2$, so $\\sigma_{24} = 1$ and the interior node is $1$, yielding $\\sigma_{24}(1) = 1$, while $\\sigma_{24}(2) = 0$ and $\\sigma_{24}(4) = 0$.\n\nTherefore the loads on the residual graph are\n$$\nL_1 = \\frac{\\sigma_{24}(1)}{\\sigma_{24}} = 1,\\quad L_2 = 0,\\quad L_4 = 0.\n$$\n\nWe now apply the failure rule $L_i  C_i$. Compare each $L_i$ to its capacity $C_i$ inherited from the initial configuration:\n- For node $1$, the condition for failure is\n$$\nL_1  C_1 \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad 1  \\frac{1+\\alpha}{2} \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad 2  1 + \\alpha \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad \\alpha  1.\n$$\n- For node $2$, $L_2 = 0$ and $C_2 = 0$, so $L_2  C_2$ is false.\n- For node $4$, $L_4 = 0$ and $C_4 = 0$, so $L_4  C_4$ is false.\n\nHence, if $\\alpha  1$, node $1$ fails; if $\\alpha \\geq 1$, node $1$ does not fail. If node $1$ fails (for $\\alpha  1$), it is removed, leaving nodes $\\{2,4\\}$ with no connecting edge. In that disconnected graph, for the only pair $(2,4)$ there are no paths, which by the definition yields $\\sigma_{24} = 0$ and thus no contributions to any node’s load; equivalently, all remaining nodes have load $0$. Since their capacities are $0$, no further failures occur and the cascade stops.\n\nTherefore, the critical tolerance $\\alpha_c$ is the minimal $\\alpha$ such that no additional nodes fail after the initial removal of node $3$, which is\n$$\n\\alpha_c = 1.\n$$\nFor all $\\alpha \\geq \\alpha_c$, the inequality $L_1  C_1$ is not satisfied, so no additional failures occur.",

For each ordered pair of distinct source and target nodes $(s,t)$, a unit quantity of commodity is injected at $s$ and delivered to $t$, and it is split uniformly among all geodesic paths from $s$ to $t$. The load $L(u)$ of a node $u$ is the total commodity that traverses $u$ as an internal node (neither source nor target).\n\nStart from the formal definition of geodesic betweenness in complex networks, namely: for a node $u$, the geodesic betweenness-based load is\n$$\nL(u) \\equiv \\sum_{s \\neq t,\\, s \\neq u,\\, t \\neq u} \\frac{\\sigma_{st}(u)}{\\sigma_{st}},\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_{st}$ is the number of geodesic paths between $s$ and $t$, and $\\sigma_{st}(u)$ is the number of such geodesic paths that pass through $u$ as an internal node.

Your final answer must list $L(h)$ and $L(v_i)$ for any leaf $v_i$.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the calculation of the load on the hub node and a leaf node of a star graph $S_{N+1}$. The load $L(u)$ is defined as the unnormalized geodesic betweenness centrality of a node $u$.\n\nThe star graph $S_{N+1}$ consists of a central hub node, which we denote by $h$, and $N$ leaf nodes, denoted by $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_N$. The total number of nodes in the graph is $N+1$. The edges in this graph are only between the hub and each leaf, i.e., the edge set is $\\{(h, v_i) \\mid i=1, \\dots, N\\}$. The degree of the hub is $N$, and the degree of each leaf is $1$.\n\nThe load on a node $u$ is given by the formula:\n$$\nL(u) = \\sum_{s \\neq t,\\, s \\neq u,\\, t \\neq u} \\frac{\\sigma_{st}(u)}{\\sigma_{st}},\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_{st}$ is the number of shortest (geodesic) paths between nodes $s$ and $t$, and $\\sigma_{st}(u)$ is the number of those shortest paths that pass through $u$ as an internal node.\n\nFirst, we analyze the geodesic paths in the star graph $S_{N+1}$:\n1.  The path between any two distinct leaf nodes, $v_i$ and $v_j$ (where $i \\neq j$), is unique and must go through the hub: $v_i \\to h \\to v_j$. The length of this path is $2$. Since the leaves $v_i$ and $v_j$ are not directly connected, this is the shortest possible path. Therefore, for any distinct leaves $v_i, v_j$, the number of geodesic paths is $\\sigma_{v_i v_j} = 1$.\n2.  The path between any leaf node $v_i$ and the hub $h$ is the direct edge $(v_i, h)$. The length of this path is $1$. This is the shortest possible path. Therefore, for any leaf $v_i$, the number of geodesic paths to the hub is $\\sigma_{v_i h} = 1$.\n\nWith this understanding, we can calculate the loads.\n\n**Load on the hub, $L(h)$**\n\nAccording to the definition, the sum for $L(h)$ is taken over all ordered pairs of nodes $(s, t)$ such that $s \\neq h$ and $t \\neq h$. This means that both $s$ and $t$ must be leaf nodes. Let $s=v_i$ and $t=v_j$ for some $i, j \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$, with the additional condition that $s \\neq t$, which implies $i \\neq j$.\n\nThe number of such ordered pairs of distinct leaf nodes is the number of permutations of $2$ items from a set of $N$, which is $P(N,2) = N(N-1)$.\n\nFor any such pair $(s, t) = (v_i, v_j)$, we have established that there is only one geodesic path between them: $v_i \\to h \\to v_j$. So, $\\sigma_{v_i v_j} = 1$. This unique path passes through the hub $h$ as an internal node. Therefore, the number of geodesic paths between $v_i$ and $v_j$ passing through $h$ is $\\sigma_{v_i v_j}(h) = 1$.\n\nThe contribution of each such pair $(v_i, v_j)$ to the load of the hub is $\\frac{\\sigma_{v_i v_j}(h)}{\\sigma_{v_i v_j}} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1$.\n\nTo find the total load $L(h)$, we sum these contributions over all possible ordered pairs of distinct leaves:\n$$\nL(h) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{j=1, j \\neq i}^{N} \\frac{\\sigma_{v_i v_j}(h)}{\\sigma_{v_i v_j}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{j=1, j \\neq i}^{N} 1\n$$\nThe sum has $N(N-1)$ terms, each equal to $1$. Thus, the load on the hub is:\n$$\nL(h) = N(N-1) = N^2 - N\n$$\n\n**Load on a leaf node, $L(v_i)$**\n\nLet's calculate the load for an arbitrary leaf node, say $v_k$, where $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$.\nThe formula for $L(v_k)$ is:\n$$\nL(v_k) = \\sum_{s \\neq t,\\, s \\neq v_k,\\, t \\neq v_k} \\frac{\\sigma_{st}(v_k)}{\\sigma_{st}}\n$$\nWe need to find if there are any geodesic paths between any pair of nodes $(s, t)$ (where neither $s$ nor $t$ is $v_k$) that pass through $v_k$.\n\nA node is an internal node of a path if it is not the start or end point. For a path to pass *through* $v_k$, it must enter $v_k$ from a neighbor and exit $v_k$ to a neighbor. However, the leaf node $v_k$ has only one neighbor, the hub $h$. Any path that passes through $v_k$ must therefore contain the segment $h \\to v_k \\to h$. A path containing such a segment, for example $s \\to \\dots \\to h \\to v_k \\to h \\to \\dots \\to t$, cannot be a geodesic path, because an alternative path $s \\to \\dots \\to h \\to \\dots \\to t$ exists and is shorter by a length of $2$.\n\nTherefore, no geodesic path between any two nodes $s$ and $t$ (neither of which is $v_k$) can pass through the leaf node $v_k$. This implies that for any valid pair $(s, t)$ in the summation, $\\sigma_{st}(v_k) = 0$.\n\nThe load on the leaf node $v_k$ is therefore:\n$$\nL(v_k) = \\sum_{s \\neq t,\\, s \\neq v_k,\\, t \\neq v_k} \\frac{0}{\\sigma_{st}} = 0\n$$\nSince this holds for any arbitrary leaf node $v_k$, we have $L(v_i) = 0$ for all $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$.\n\n**Asymptotic Scaling Justification**\n\nThe explicit result for the hub's load is $L(h) = N^2 - N$. For large $N$, the dominant term is $N^2$. Thus, the hub's load scales as $O(N^2)$. This quadratic scaling arises because the hub is the sole intermediary for all traffic between any pair of the $N$ leaves. The number of such origin-destination pairs is $N(N-1)$, which grows quadratically with $N$.\n\nThe explicit result for any leaf's load is $L(v_i) = 0$. This is a constant value independent of $N$. The scaling is therefore $O(1)$. This is because leaf nodes, by their structural nature (degree of $1$), can never serve as intermediate points on any shortest path. They are exclusively origin or destination points. Consequently, their betweenness-based load is always zero, regardless of the size of the network.",

If $L_{i}^{X}(G) = 0$ and $L_{i}^{X}(G')  0$, any finite capacity is overcome, implying an infinite critical margin. We will verify this does not occur.\nThe critical margin $\\alpha_{c}^{X}$ is the smallest $\\alpha$ that satisfies this condition for all surviving nodes $i$.

The graph is a 4-cycle, and all nodes are topologically equivalent by symmetry. Thus, $L_{i}^{\\mathrm{SP}}(G)$ is the same for all $i \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$. Let's compute $L_{3}^{\\mathrm{SP}}(G)$. The unordered pairs $\\{s,t\\}$ not containing node $3$ are $\\{1,2\\}, \\{1,4\\}, \\{2,4\\}$.\n- For $\\{s,t\\} = \\{1,2\\}$: The shortest path is the edge $(1,2)$ of length $1$. Node $3$ is not on this path. Contribution is $0$.\n- For $\\{s,t\\} = \\{1,4\\}$: There are two shortest paths of length $2$: $1-2-4$ and $1-3-4$. Node $3$ lies on one of these two paths. The fraction is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n- For $\\{s,t\\} = \\{2,4\\}$: The shortest path is the edge $(2,4)$ of length $1$. Node $3$ is not on this path. Contribution is $0$.\nThe total load is $L_{3}^{\\mathrm{SP}}(G) = 0 + \\frac{1}{2} + 0 = \\frac{1}{2}$. By symmetry, $L_{i}^{\\mathrm{SP}}(G) = \\frac{1}{2}$ for all $i \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$.\n\nNext, we analyze the graph $G' = G \\setminus \\{2\\}$. Removing node $2$ and its incident edges $(1,2)$ and $(2,4)$ leaves a graph with nodes $\\{1,3,4\\}$ and edges $\\{(1,3),(3,4)\\}$. This is a simple path $1-3-4$. The surviving nodes are $1, 3, 4$.\nWe compute the new loads $L_{i}^{\\mathrm{SP}}(G')$.\n- For node $1$: The only pair not containing $1$ is $\\{3,4\\}$. The shortest path is the edge $(3,4)$. Node $1$ is not on this path. Thus, $L_{1}^{\\mathrm{SP}}(G') = 0$.\n- For node $4$: The only pair not containing $4$ is $\\{1,3\\}$. The shortest path is the edge $(1,3)$. Node $4$ is not on this path. Thus, $L_{4}^{\\mathrm{SP}}(G') = 0$.\n- For node $3$: The only pair not containing $3$ is $\\{1,4\\}$. The unique shortest path is $1-3-4$. Node $3$ lies on this path. The fraction is $1$. Thus, $L_{3}^{\\mathrm{SP}}(G') = 1$.\n\nNow, we compute $\\alpha_{c}^{\\mathrm{SP}}$ using the derived formula for the surviving nodes $\\{1,3,4\\}$:\n$$ \\alpha_{c}^{\\mathrm{SP}} = \\max \\left\\{ \\frac{L_{1}^{\\mathrm{SP}}(G') - L_{1}^{\\mathrm{SP}}(G)}{L_{1}^{\\mathrm{SP}}(G)}, \\frac{L_{3}^{\\mathrm{SP}}(G') - L_{3}^{\\mathrm{SP}}(G)}{L_{3}^{\\mathrm{SP}}(G)}, \\frac{L_{4}^{\\mathrm{SP}}(G') - L_{4}^{\\mathrm{SP}}(G)}{L_{4}^{\\mathrm{SP}}(G)} \\right\\} $$\n$$ \\alpha_{c}^{\\mathrm{SP}} = \\max \\left\\{ \\frac{0 - \\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{1}{2}}, \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{1}{2}}, \\frac{0 - \\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{1}{2}} \\right\\} = \\max \\left\\{ -1, \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{1}{2}}, -1 \\right\\} = \\max\\{-1, 1, -1\\} = 1 $$\n\n#### Calculation of $\\alpha_{c}^{\\mathrm{CF}}$\nFirst, we compute the current-flow betweenness loads on graph $G$. Each edge has resistance $R=1$. By symmetry, all node loads are equal. We calculate $L_{3}^{\\mathrm{CF}}(G)$ by summing over pairs $\\{1,2\\}, \\{1,4\\}, \\{2,4\\}$.\n- For $\\{s,t\\} = \\{1,2\\}$: A unit current is injected at $1$ and extracted at $2$. The graph has two parallel branches between $1$ and $2$: the direct edge $(1,2)$ with resistance $R_1=1$, and the path $1-3-4-2$ with resistance $R_2=3$. The current splits inversely to resistance. The current through the path $1-3-4-2$ is $I_2 = \\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{4}$. This current flows through edges $(1,3)$ and $(3,4)$. For node $3$, $\\tau_{12}(3) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{j \\in N(3)} |I_{3j}^{(12)}| = \\frac{1}{2} (|I_{31}^{(12)}| + |I_{34}^{(12)}|) = \\frac{1}{2} (\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4}) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n- For $\\{s,t\\} = \\{1,4\\}$: Current from $1$ to $4$. There are two parallel paths of equal resistance: $1-2-4$ ($R=2$) and $1-3-4$ ($R=2$). The current splits equally, so $0.5$ A flows through path $1-3-4$. Thus, $|I_{31}^{(14)}|=|I_{34}^{(14)}|=\\frac{1}{2}$. For node $3$, $\\tau_{14}(3) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- For $\\{s,t\\} = \\{2,4\\}$: This is symmetric to the $\\{1,2\\}$ case with respect to node $3$. The current through path $2-1-3-4$ is $\\frac{1}{4}$. Thus, $|I_{31}^{(24)}|=|I_{34}^{(24)}|=\\frac{1}{4}$. For node $3$, $\\tau_{24}(3) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{4}) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nThe total load is $L_{3}^{\\mathrm{CF}}(G) = \\tau_{12}(3) + \\tau_{14}(3) + \\tau_{24}(3) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = 1$. By symmetry, $L_{i}^{\\mathrm{CF}}(G) = 1$ for all $i$.\n\nNext, we compute the loads $L_{i}^{\\mathrm{CF}}(G')$ on the path graph $G' = 1-3-4$. The surviving nodes are $1, 3, 4$.\n- For nodes $1$ and $4$: the only pair of nodes available is $\\{1,4\\}$. Since nodes $1$ and $4$ are the source/sink for this pair, their betweenness is $0$. Thus, $L_{1}^{\\mathrm{CF}}(G') = 0$ and $L_{4}^{\\mathrm{CF}}(G') = 0$.\n- For node $3$: The only contributing pair is $\\{1,4\\}$. A unit current from $1$ to $4$ must flow entirely along the path $1-3-4$. So, the current through edges $(1,3)$ and $(3,4)$ is $1$. The load is $L_{3}^{\\mathrm{CF}}(G') = \\tau_{14}(3) = \\frac{1}{2}(|I_{31}^{(14)}| + |I_{34}^{(14)}|) = \\frac{1}{2}(1+1) = 1$.\n\nNow, we compute $\\alpha_{c}^{\\mathrm{CF}}$ for the surviving nodes $\\{1,3,4\\}$:\n$$ \\alpha_{c}^{\\mathrm{CF}} = \\max \\left\\{ \\frac{L_{1}^{\\mathrm{CF}}(G') - L_{1}^{\\mathrm{CF}}(G)}{L_{1}^{\\mathrm{CF}}(G)}, \\frac{L_{3}^{\\mathrm{CF}}(G') - L_{3}^{\\mathrm{CF}}(G)}{L_{3}^{\\mathrm{CF}}(G)}, \\frac{L_{4}^{\\mathrm{CF}}(G') - L_{4}^{\\mathrm{CF}}(G)}{L_{4}^{\\mathrm{CF}}(G)} \\right\\} $$\n$$ \\alpha_{c}^{\\mathrm{CF}} = \\max \\left\\{ \\frac{0 - 1}{1}, \\frac{1 - 1}{1}, \\frac{0 - 1}{1} \\right\\} = \\max\\{-1, 0, -1\\} = 0 $$\n\n#### Final Calculation of $\\Delta \\alpha_c$\nWe are asked for the difference $\\Delta \\alpha_c = \\alpha_{c}^{\\mathrm{CF}} - \\alpha_{c}^{\\mathrm{SP}}$.\n$$ \\Delta \\alpha_c = 0 - 1 = -1 $$\nThe result shows that for this specific scenario, the network is significantly more robust (requires zero tolerance margin) when load is defined by current flow compared to when it is defined by shortest paths (which requires a $100\\%$ margin).",
