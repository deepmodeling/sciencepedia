This first practice invites you to perform a step-by-step analysis of a small network, calculating initial node loads based on betweenness centrality and then re-evaluating them after a single node is removed . By tracing how traffic reroutes and loads intensify, you will determine the critical tolerance margin $\\alpha_c$ needed to prevent the initial failure from triggering a wider collapse, providing a concrete foundation for the abstract principles of the Motter-Lai model.",

            "problem": "Consider an undirected, unweighted graph with node set $V = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ and edge set $E = \\{(1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,1), (1,3)\\}$, which forms a square with one diagonal. The load $L_i$ on node $i$ is defined as the betweenness centrality based on shortest paths: for each unordered pair of distinct nodes $(s,t)$ with $s \\neq i$ and $t \\neq i$, let $\\sigma_{st}$ denote the number of shortest paths between $s$ and $t$, and let $\\sigma_{st}(i)$ denote the number of those shortest paths that pass through node $i$; then\n$$\nL_i \\equiv \\sum_{\\substack{st\\\\ s \\neq i,\\, t \\neq i}} \\frac{\\sigma_{st}(i)}{\\sigma_{st}}.\n$$\nDefine the initial load $L_i^0$ as $L_i$ computed on the full graph $(V,E)$, and the capacity of node $i$ as $C_i = (1 + \\alpha)\\,L_i^0$, where $\\alpha \\geq 0$ is a uniform tolerance parameter. Suppose node $3$ is exogenously removed. In the resulting residual network, recompute the loads $L_i$ for all remaining nodes using the same definition, and apply the failure rule that any node $i$ with $L_i  C_i$ fails (is removed). Assume loads are recomputed after each removal and the process continues until no further failures occur.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definitions above and without using pre-derived shortcut formulas, derive the critical tolerance value $\\alpha_c$ such that for all $\\alpha \\geq \\alpha_c$, no additional nodes fail after the initial removal of node $3$.\n\nProvide your final answer as a single real number. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "We begin from the definition of betweenness centrality for load. On the original graph $(V,E)$ with $V = \\{1,2,3,4\\}$ and $E = \\{(1,2),(2,3),(3,4),(4,1),(1,3)\\}$, we compute $L_i^0$ for each node $i$ by enumerating all unordered pairs $(s,t)$ with $s  t$ and $s \\neq i$, $t \\neq i$. The possible unordered pairs are:\n$$\n(1,2),\\ (1,3),\\ (1,4),\\ (2,3),\\ (2,4),\\ (3,4).\n$$\nWe analyze shortest paths for each pair:\n\n- For $(1,2)$, the shortest path length is $1$ via edge $(1,2)$, so there is a single shortest path with no interior node. Thus for any $i$, $\\sigma_{12} = 1$ and $\\sigma_{12}(i) = 0$.\n\n- For $(1,3)$, the diagonal $(1,3)$ gives a shortest path of length $1$. Alternative paths such as $(1,2,3)$ or $(1,4,3)$ have length $2$ and are not shortest. Hence $\\sigma_{13} = 1$ and $\\sigma_{13}(i) = 0$ for all $i$.\n\n- For $(1,4)$, edge $(1,4)$ is a shortest path of length $1$, so $\\sigma_{14} = 1$ and $\\sigma_{14}(i) = 0$ for all $i$.\n\n- For $(2,3)$, edge $(2,3)$ is a shortest path of length $1$, so $\\sigma_{23} = 1$ and $\\sigma_{23}(i) = 0$ for all $i$.\n\n- For $(3,4)$, edge $(3,4)$ is a shortest path of length $1$, so $\\sigma_{34} = 1$ and $\\sigma_{34}(i) = 0$ for all $i$.\n\n- For $(2,4)$, there is no direct edge, and the shortest path length is $2$. There are exactly two distinct shortest paths of length $2$: $(2,3,4)$ and $(2,1,4)$. Therefore $\\sigma_{24} = 2$. For node $1$, exactly one of these two shortest paths, $(2,1,4)$, passes through $1$, so $\\sigma_{24}(1) = 1$. For node $3$, exactly one, $(2,3,4)$, passes through $3$, so $\\sigma_{24}(3) = 1$. For nodes $2$ and $4$, these are endpoints and not counted as interior, so $\\sigma_{24}(2) = 0$ and $\\sigma_{24}(4) = 0$.\n\nSumming the contributions over all pairs for each node $i$, we obtain the initial loads:\n$$\nL_1^0 = \\frac{\\sigma_{24}(1)}{\\sigma_{24}} = \\frac{1}{2},\\quad L_3^0 = \\frac{\\sigma_{24}(3)}{\\sigma_{24}} = \\frac{1}{2},\\quad L_2^0 = 0,\\quad L_4^0 = 0.\n$$\nThus the capacities are\n$$\nC_1 = (1+\\alpha)\\,L_1^0 = \\frac{1+\\alpha}{2},\\quad C_3 = \\frac{1+\\alpha}{2},\\quad C_2 = 0,\\quad C_4 = 0.\n$$\n\nNow we exogenously remove node $3$. The residual graph has node set $\\{1,2,4\\}$ and edge set $\\{(1,2),(1,4)\\}$. This is a path of length $2$ with $1$ as the middle node. We recompute loads $L_i$ on this residual graph using the same shortest-path betweenness definition.\n\nThe unordered pairs among remaining nodes are $(1,2)$, $(1,4)$, and $(2,4)$.\n\n- For $(1,2)$, the shortest path length is $1$ via $(1,2)$, with no interior node. Hence $\\sigma_{12} = 1$ and $\\sigma_{12}(i) = 0$ for all $i$.\n\n- For $(1,4)$, the shortest path length is $1$ via $(1,4)$, with no interior node. Hence $\\sigma_{14} = 1$ and $\\sigma_{14}(i) = 0$ for all $i$.\n\n- For $(2,4)$, there is no direct edge. The unique shortest path is $(2,1,4)$ of length $2$, so $\\sigma_{24} = 1$ and the interior node is $1$, yielding $\\sigma_{24}(1) = 1$, while $\\sigma_{24}(2) = 0$ and $\\sigma_{24}(4) = 0$.\n\nTherefore the loads on the residual graph are\n$$\nL_1 = \\frac{\\sigma_{24}(1)}{\\sigma_{24}} = 1,\\quad L_2 = 0,\\quad L_4 = 0.\n$$\n\nWe now apply the failure rule $L_i  C_i$. Compare each $L_i$ to its capacity $C_i$ inherited from the initial configuration:\n- For node $1$, the condition for failure is\n$$\nL_1  C_1 \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad 1  \\frac{1+\\alpha}{2} \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad 2  1 + \\alpha \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad \\alpha  1.\n$$\n- For node $2$, $L_2 = 0$ and $C_2 = 0$, so $L_2  C_2$ is false.\n- For node $4$, $L_4 = 0$ and $C_4 = 0$, so $L_4  C_4$ is false.\n\nHence, if $\\alpha  1$, node $1$ fails; if $\\alpha \\geq 1$, node $1$ does not fail. If node $1$ fails (for $\\alpha  1$), it is removed, leaving nodes $\\{2,4\\}$ with no connecting edge. In that disconnected graph, for the only pair $(2,4)$ there are no paths, which by the definition yields $\\sigma_{24} = 0$ and thus no contributions to any node’s load; equivalently, all remaining nodes have load $0$. Since their capacities are $0$, no further failures occur and the cascade stops.\n\nTherefore, the critical tolerance $\\alpha_c$ is the minimal $\\alpha$ such that no additional nodes fail after the initial removal of node $3$, which is\n$$\n\\alpha_c = 1.\n$$\nFor all $\\alpha \\geq \\alpha_c$, the inequality $L_1  C_1$ is not satisfied, so no additional failures occur.",

Define the load $\\ell(e)$ of an edge $e$ as the total amount of flow that traverses $e$ under this APSP routing.\n\nInitially, both inter-community edges $e_{1}$ and $e_{2}$ are present.

Since each pair contributes a unit demand, the total inter-community flow is $mn$.\n\n**1. Initial Load ($\\ell_{\\text{pre}}$)**\n\nBefore any edge removal, this total flow of $mn$ must cross the boundary between the communities, which is spanned by the two edges $e_1$ and $e_2$. Therefore, the sum of loads on these edges must equal the total flow:\n$$ \\ell_{\\text{pre}}(e_1) + \\ell_{\\text{pre}}(e_2) = mn $$\nThe network topology is perfectly symmetric with respect to the two inter-community edges. A relabeling that swaps $(a_1, b_1)$ with $(a_2, b_2)$ results in an identical graph structure. As the All-Pairs Shortest Path routing rule is also symmetric, the load must be distributed equally between these two edges:\n$$ \\ell_{\\text{pre}}(e_1) = \\ell_{\\text{pre}}(e_2) $$\nCombining these two equations, we get $2 \\cdot \\ell_{\\text{pre}}(e_2) = mn$, which yields:\n$$ \\ell_{\\text{pre}}(e_2) = \\frac{mn}{2} $$\n\n**2. Post-Removal Load ($\\ell_{\\text{post}}$)**\n\nAfter edge $e_1$ is removed, the edge $e_2$ becomes the sole connection between the two communities, acting as a bridge. The network remains connected. Consequently, all inter-community flow must now traverse $e_2$. The total load on $e_2$ is therefore the sum of all inter-community demands:\n$$ \\ell_{\\text{post}}(e_2) = mn $$\n\n**3. Multiplicative Increase Factor**\n\nThe multiplicative increase in the load on edge $e_2$ is the ratio of the post-removal load to the pre-removal load:\n$$ \\frac{\\ell_{\\text{post}}(e_2)}{\\ell_{\\text{pre}}(e_2)} = \\frac{mn}{\\frac{mn}{2}} = 2 $$\nThus, the load on the remaining inter-community edge exactly doubles, regardless of the community sizes $m$ and $n$.",

In the standard model, the load is the shortest-path betweenness centrality.

For each unordered pair $\\{s,t\\}$ with $s \\neq t$, inject unit current at $s$ and extract unit current at $t$, solve for node potentials consistent with KCL and OL, and define the pairwise throughput through node $i \\notin \\{s,t\\}$ as $\\tau_{st}(i) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{j \\in N(i)} |I_{ij}^{(st)}|$, where $I_{ij}^{(st)}$ is the resulting current on edge $(i,j)$, and $N(i)$ is the neighbor set of $i$.
