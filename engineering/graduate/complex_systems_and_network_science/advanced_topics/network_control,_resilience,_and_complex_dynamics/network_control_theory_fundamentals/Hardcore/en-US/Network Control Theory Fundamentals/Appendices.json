The concept of controllability asks whether, for any initial state $x(0)$ and any desired final state $x(T)$ at a finite time $T0$, there exists an input $u(t)$ that steers the system from $x(0)$ to $x(T)$.

            "solution": "The problem presents a continuous-time Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system and asks for an analysis of its controllability using two standard methods: the controllability matrix and the controllability Gramian.\n\nThe system is described by the state-space equation $\\dot{x}(t)=A\\,x(t)+B\\,u(t)$, with the state dimension $n=2$ and the input dimension $m=1$. The given matrices are:\n$$\nA=\\begin{bmatrix}0  1\\\\ 0  0\\end{bmatrix},\\qquad B=\\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\ 1\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe first task is to compute the controllability matrix $C$ and use its rank to determine if the system is controllable.\nFor a general LTI system of dimension $n$, the controllability matrix is defined as:\n$$\nC = \\begin{bmatrix} B  AB  A^2B  \\cdots  A^{n-1}B \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nIn this specific case, $n=2$, so the controllability matrix is a $2 \\times 2$ matrix given by:\n$$\nC = \\begin{bmatrix} B  AB \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe first column is the matrix $B$ itself. The second column is the product $AB$. We compute this product:\n$$\nAB = \\begin{bmatrix}0  1\\\\ 0  0\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\ 1\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} (0)(0) + (1)(1) \\\\ (0)(0) + (0)(1) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}1\\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we assemble the controllability matrix $C$ by concatenating the columns $B$ and $AB$:\n$$\nC = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe Kalman rank condition states that the system is controllable if and only if the rank of the controllability matrix $C$ is equal to the dimension of the state space, $n$. Here, $n=2$. To find the rank of $C$, we can check for linear independence of its columns or compute its determinant. The columns of $C$ are $\\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\ 1\\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\begin{bmatrix}1\\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix}$, which are the standard basis vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and are manifestly linearly independent. Alternatively, we compute the determinant:\n$$\n\\det(C) = (0)(0) - (1)(1) = -1\n$$\nSince $\\det(C) \\neq 0$, the matrix $C$ is invertible and has full rank. The rank of the $2 \\times 2$ matrix $C$ is therefore $2$.\n$$\n\\text{rank}(C) = 2\n$$\nSince $\\text{rank}(C) = n = 2$, we conclude that the system is controllable.\n\nThe second task is to compute the finite-horizon controllability Gramian $W_{c}(T)$ and discuss its positive definiteness as a cross-check. The Gramian is defined as:\n$$\nW_{c}(T) = \\int_{0}^{T} e^{A\\tau} B B^T e^{A^T\\tau} d\\tau\n$$\nFirst, we must compute the state transition matrix, $e^{A\\tau}$, which is the matrix exponential. We can use the Taylor series expansion $e^{A\\tau} = I + A\\tau + \\frac{(A\\tau)^2}{2!} + \\cdots$. Let's compute the powers of $A$:\n$$\nA^2 = A \\cdot A = \\begin{bmatrix}0  1\\\\ 0  0\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}0  1\\\\ 0  0\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}0  0\\\\ 0  0\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nSince $A^2$ is the zero matrix, all higher powers $A^k$ for $k \\geq 2$ are also zero. The matrix $A$ is nilpotent. The series for the matrix exponential thus truncates after the linear term:\n$$\ne^{A\\tau} = I + A\\tau = \\begin{bmatrix}1  0\\\\ 0  1\\end{bmatrix} + \\tau\\begin{bmatrix}0  1\\\\ 0  0\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}1  \\tau\\\\ 0  1\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe transpose, $e^{A^T\\tau}$, is simply $(e^{A\\tau})^T$:\n$$\ne^{A^T\\tau} = \\begin{bmatrix}1  \\tau\\\\ 0  1\\end{bmatrix}^T = \\begin{bmatrix}1  0\\\\ \\tau  1\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we compute the matrix product $BB^T$:\n$$\nBB^T = \\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\ 1\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}0  1\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}0  0\\\\ 0  1\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nNow we assemble the integrand $e^{A\\tau} B B^T e^{A^T\\tau}$:\n$$\ne^{A\\tau} B B^T e^{A^T\\tau} = \\begin{bmatrix}1  \\tau\\\\ 0  1\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}0  0\\\\ 0  1\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}1  0\\\\ \\tau  1\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n= \\begin{bmatrix}(1)(0)+(\\tau)(0)  (1)(0)+(\\tau)(1)\\\\ (0)(0)+(1)(0)  (0)(0)+(1)(1)\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}1  0\\\\ \\tau  1\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}0  \\tau\\\\ 0  1\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}1  0\\\\ \\tau  1\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n= \\begin{bmatrix}(0)(1)+(\\tau)(\\tau)  (0)(0)+(\\tau)(1)\\\\ (0)(1)+(1)(\\tau)  (0)(0)+(1)(1)\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\\tau^2  \\tau\\\\ \\tau  1\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nFinally, we integrate this matrix from $\\tau=0$ to $\\tau=T$:\n$$\nW_{c}(T) = \\int_{0}^{T} \\begin{bmatrix}\\tau^2  \\tau\\\\ \\tau  1\\end{bmatrix} d\\tau = \\begin{bmatrix} \\int_{0}^{T}\\tau^2 d\\tau  \\int_{0}^{T}\\tau d\\tau \\\\ \\int_{0}^{T}\\tau d\\tau  \\int_{0}^{T}1 d\\tau \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n= \\begin{bmatrix} \\left[\\frac{\\tau^3}{3}\\right]_{0}^{T}  \\left[\\frac{\\tau^2}{2}\\right]_{0}^{T} \\\\ \\left[\\frac{\\tau^2}{2}\\right]_{0}^{T}  \\left[\\tau\\right]_{0}^{T} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{T^3}{3}  \\frac{T^2}{2} \\\\ \\frac{T^2}{2}  T \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nA system is controllable if and only if its controllability Gramian $W_c(T)$ is positive definite for any $T0$. A symmetric matrix is positive definite if all its leading principal minors are positive.\nThe first leading principal minor is the $(1,1)$ element: $\\frac{T^3}{3}$.

Express your final answer as a single real number with no units. Do not round.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the construction of a simple $4$-node undirected graph, represented by its real symmetric adjacency matrix $A$, and a single-node scalar input, represented by the matrix $B$, such that the linear time-invariant (LTI) system $\\dot{x}(t)=A x(t)+B u(t)$ with $x(t)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{4}$ and $u(t)\\in\\mathbb{R}$ is not controllable. We must demonstrate this using the properties of eigenvectors of symmetric matrices and identify the specific real eigenvalue $\\lambda$ for which the Popov–Belevitch–Hautus (PBH) test for controllability fails.\n\nFirst, we establish the theoretical criterion for uncontrollability that will guide our construction. The PBH test states that the pair $(A, B)$ is controllable if and only if the matrix $[A - \\lambda I \\mid B]$ has full rank, i.e., $\\text{rank}[A - \\lambda I \\mid B] = n$, for all eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $A$, where $n$ is the dimension of the state space. In our case, $n=4$.\n\nIf the system is uncontrollable, there must exist some eigenvalue $\\lambda$ of $A$ for which $\\text{rank}[A - \\lambda I \\mid B]  4$. This rank deficiency is equivalent to the existence of a non-zero row vector $w^T$ such that $w^T [A - \\lambda I \\mid B] = [0, \\dots, 0]$. This expands into two conditions: $w^T(A - \\lambda I) = 0$ and $w^T B = 0$. The first condition, $w^T A = \\lambda w^T$, signifies that $w^T$ is a left eigenvector of $A$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda$. Since the problem specifies that $A$ is a real symmetric matrix, its left eigenvectors are the transposes of its right eigenvectors. Thus, we can let $w = v$, where $v$ is a right eigenvector of $A$ satisfying $Av = \\lambda v$. The two conditions for uncontrollability become:\n$1$. $Av = \\lambda v$ for some eigenvector $v \\neq 0$ and eigenvalue $\\lambda$.\n$2$. $v^T B = 0$.\n\nThis provides a clear path forward: we must construct a symmetric matrix $A$ and an input matrix $B$ such that there exists an eigenvector $v$ of $A$ that is orthogonal to $B$.\n\nLet us construct a simple undirected graph with $n=4$ nodes that possesses symmetry, as symmetry often gives rise to eigenvectors with specific structural properties (e.g., zero entries). A suitable choice is the 4-cycle graph, $C_4$, with vertices labeled $1, 2, 3, 4$ and edges $(1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,1)$. The corresponding adjacency matrix $A$ is:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  0  1 \\\\ 1  0  1  0 \\\\ 0  1  0  1 \\\\ 1  0  1  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix is real and symmetric, as required. This graph is also known as the complete bipartite graph $K_{2,2}$ with partitions $\\{1,3\\}$ and $\\{2,4\\}$.\n\nThe symmetry of this graph can be exploited. Consider the reflectional symmetry that swaps nodes $1$ and $3$ while leaving nodes $2$ and $4$ fixed. An eigenvector $v$ that is anti-symmetric with respect to this reflection must satisfy $v_1 = -v_3$, $v_2 = -v_2$, and $v_4 = -v_4$. This directly implies that $v_2=0$ and $v_4=0$. Such an eigenvector would have the form $[c, 0, -c, 0]^T$ for some non-zero constant $c$.\n\nLet us verify that an eigenvector of this form exists. We must find an eigenvalue $\\lambda$ and a non-zero vector $v$ of the form $[c, 0, -c, 0]^T$ such that $Av = \\lambda v$.\n$$\nAv = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  0  1 \\\\ 1  0  1  0 \\\\ 0  1  0  1 \\\\ 1  0  1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} c \\\\ 0 \\\\ -c \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ c - c \\\\ 0 \\\\ c - c \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor this to satisfy $Av = \\lambda v$, we must have:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\lambda \\begin{pmatrix} c \\\\ 0 \\\\ -c \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince we require a non-trivial eigenvector, we must have $c \\neq 0$. Thus, the equation can only be satisfied if $\\lambda = 0$. This demonstrates that an eigenvector of the form $v = [c, 0, -c, 0]^T$ exists and its corresponding eigenvalue is $\\lambda = 0$. We can choose $c=1$ without loss of generality, yielding the eigenvector $v = [1, 0, -1, 0]^T$. The eigenvalue $\\lambda=0$ is indeed an eigenvalue of $A$, as $A$ is singular (row $1$ is identical to row $3$, and row $2$ is identical to row $4$).\n\nNow, we choose the input matrix $B$ to make the input orthogonal to this eigenvector $v$. The condition is $v^T B = 0$. The eigenvector $v=[1, 0, -1, 0]^T$ has zero entries in its second and fourth components. We must place the single scalar input at a node where the eigenvector has a zero. Let's choose to apply the control input to node $2$. The input matrix $B$ is then the second standard basis vector $e_2$:\n$$\nB = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe now check the orthogonality condition:\n$$\nv^T B = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  -1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 1 \\cdot 0 + 0 \\cdot 1 + (-1) \\cdot 0 + 0 \\cdot 0 = 0\n$$\nThe condition is satisfied. Therefore, the system defined by this pair $(A, B)$ is uncontrollable. The eigenmode corresponding to the eigenvector $v$ is orthogonal to the input and cannot be excited or controlled.\n\nThe specific eigenvalue $\\lambda$ at which the PBH rank condition fails is the eigenvalue associated with the eigenvector $v$. As determined above, this eigenvalue is $\\lambda = 0$. To explicitly verify the failure of the PBH test, we check the rank of $[A-\\lambda I \\mid B]$ for $\\lambda=0$:\n$$\n\\text{rank}[A - 0 \\cdot I \\mid B] = \\text{rank}[A \\mid B] = \\text{rank} \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  0  1  0 \\\\ 1  0  1  0  1 \\\\ 0  1  0  1  0 \\\\ 1  0  1  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe can perform row operations to find the rank. Subtracting row $1$ from row $3$ gives a row of zeros. Subtracting row $2$ from row $4$ gives $[0, 0, 0, 0, -1]$. The resulting matrix is:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  0  1  0 \\\\ 1  0  1  0  1 \\\\ 0  0  0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0  0  -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix clearly has three linearly independent rows (rows $1$, $2$, and $4$), so its rank is $3$. Since $\\text{rank}[A \\mid B] = 3  n=4$, the PBH test fails at $\\lambda=0$, confirming the system is not controllable.\n\nThe problem asks for the real eigenvalue $\\lambda$ at which the rank condition fails. This value is $0$.",

A mode corresponds to an eigenvalue of the system matrix $A$. An eigenvalue $\\lambda$ is considered unstable if its real part is non-negative, i.e., $\\text{Re}(\\lambda) \\ge 0$.\n\nFirst, we must identify the eigenvalues of the system matrix $A$. The matrix $A$ is an upper-triangular matrix. A property of triangular matrices is that their eigenvalues are the entries on their main diagonal. Therefore, the eigenvalues of $A$ are:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 = -1, \\quad \\lambda_2 = -2, \\quad \\lambda_3 = -3, \\quad \\lambda_4 = \\alpha\n$$\nThe problem specifies that $\\alpha  0$.

We can use the eigenvector test for controllability, which is a foundational method. A mode corresponding to an eigenvalue $\\lambda$ is uncontrollable if and only if there exists a left eigenvector $v$ of $A$ corresponding to $\\lambda$ that is orthogonal to the columns of $B$, i.e., $v^T B = 0$.\n\nLet $v_4 = \\begin{pmatrix} v_{41}  v_{42}  v_{43}  v_{44} \\end{pmatrix}^T$ be a left eigenvector of $A$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda_4 = \\alpha$. By definition, it must satisfy the equation $v_4^T A = \\lambda_4 v_4^T$, which is $v_4^T A = \\alpha v_4^T$.\nWriting this out component-wise:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} v_{41}  v_{42}  v_{43}  v_{44} \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-1  2  0  0 \\\\\n0  -2  1  0 \\\\\n0  0  -3  0 \\\\\n0  0  0  \\alpha\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= \\alpha \\begin{pmatrix} v_{41}  v_{42}  v_{43}  v_{44} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix equation yields a system of four linear equations:\n1. $-v_{41} = \\alpha v_{41} \\implies (1+\\alpha)v_{41} = 0$. Since $\\alpha  0$, $(1+\\alpha) \\neq 0$, which implies $v_{41}=0$.\n2. $2v_{41} - 2v_{42} = \\alpha v_{42} \\implies 2v_{41} = (\\alpha+2)v_{42}$. Substituting $v_{41}=0$, we get $(\\alpha+2)v_{42} = 0$. Since $\\alpha  0$, $(\\alpha+2) \\neq 0$, which implies $v_{42}=0$.\n3. $v_{42} - 3v_{43} = \\alpha v_{43} \\implies v_{42} = (\\alpha+3)v_{43}$. Substituting $v_{42}=0$, we get $(\\alpha+3)v_{43} = 0$. Since $\\alpha  0$, $(\\alpha+3) \\neq 0$, which implies $v_{43}=0$.\n4. $\\alpha v_{44} = \\alpha v_{44}$, which simplifies to $0=0$. This equation does not constrain $v_{44}$.\n\nFor an eigenvector to be non-zero, we must have at least one non-zero component. We can choose $v_{44}=1$. Thus, the left eigenvector corresponding to $\\lambda_4=\\alpha$ is any non-zero scalar multiple of $v_4=\\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix}^T$.\n\nNow, we apply the eigenvector test for controllability by computing $v_4^T B$:\n$$\nv_4^T B = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1  0 \\\\\n0  1 \\\\\n0  0 \\\\\n0  0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= \\begin{pmatrix} (0)(1) + (0)(0) + (0)(0) + (1)(0)  (0)(0) + (0)(1) + (0)(0) + (1)(0) \\end{pmatrix}\n= \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince $v_4^T B = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\end{pmatrix}$, the mode corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda_4 = \\alpha$ is uncontrollable.\nBecause there exists an unstable eigenvalue ($\\lambda_4 = \\alpha  0$) that corresponds to an uncontrollable mode, the system $(A,B)$ is not stabilizable.\n\nThe failure mode is due to the network structure. The state matrix $A$ reveals that node $4$ is decoupled from the subgraph formed by nodes $1$, $2$, and $3$. Specifically, the fourth row of $A$ has zeros in the first three columns, meaning no links are directed towards node $4$ from any other node. The dynamics of state $x_4$ are governed solely by $\\dot{x}_4(t) = \\alpha x_4(t)$. The input matrix $B$ shows that the control inputs act on nodes $1$ and $2$, but not on node $4$ (the fourth row of $B$ is composed of zeros). Consequently, there is no path for the control signal to influence the state $x_4$, either directly or indirectly through the network. This makes the dynamics of $x_4$ impossible to alter.\n\nThe explicit goal of stabilization is to use state feedback, $u(t)=Kx(t)$, to place the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system matrix, $A_{CL} = A+BK$, in the open left-half of the complex plane. Let's examine $A+BK$:\n$$\nA+BK = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-1  2  0  0 \\\\\n0  -2  1  0 \\\\\n0  0  -3  0 \\\\\n0  0  0  \\alpha\n\\end{pmatrix} +\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1  0 \\\\\n0  1 \\\\\n0  0 \\\\\n0  0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nk_{11}  k_{12}  k_{13}  k_{14} \\\\\nk_{21}  k_{22}  k_{23}  k_{24}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nA+BK = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-1+k_{11}  2+k_{12}  k_{13}  k_{14} \\\\\nk_{21}  -2+k_{22}  1+k_{23}  k_{24} \\\\\n0  0  -3  0 \\\\\n0  0  0  \\alpha\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe resulting closed-loop matrix $A+BK$ remains upper-triangular. Its eigenvalues are its diagonal entries: $-1+k_{11}$, $-2+k_{22}$, $-3$, and $\\alpha$. While the feedback gains $k_{11}$ and $k_{22}$ can be chosen to arbitrarily place two of the eigenvalues, the eigenvalues $-3$ and $\\alpha$ are invariant under any state feedback. Since $\\alpha  0$, the closed-loop system will always possess an unstable eigenvalue at $\\lambda=\\alpha$, irrespective of the choice of control.\n\nTherefore, the system is not stabilizable. The specific failure is the presence of the uncontrollable unstable eigenvalue $\\lambda = \\alpha$.",
