            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All provided information is consistent and sufficient to determine a unique solution. The problem requires the application of fundamental definitions from graph theory and algebraic topology, specifically pertaining to clique complexes and the Euler characteristic, which are standard concepts in network analysis and complex systems.\n\nThe problem asks for the determination of the abstract simplicial complex $X(G)$ induced by the cliques of a given graph $G$, the enumeration of its simplices by dimension, and the computation of its Euler characteristic. We begin by recalling the necessary definitions.\n\nA **clique** in a graph $G$ is a subset of its vertices where every two distinct vertices in the subset are adjacent.\nAn **abstract simplicial complex** $X$ on a finite set of vertices $V$ is a collection of subsets of $V$, called simplices, such that if $\\sigma$ is a simplex in $X$, then any non-empty subset $\\tau \\subseteq \\sigma$ is also a simplex in $X$.\nThe **clique complex** of a graph $G$, denoted $X(G)$, is the abstract simplicial complex whose simplices are the cliques of $G$.\nThe **dimension** of a simplex $\\sigma$ is defined as $\\dim(\\sigma) = |\\sigma| - 1$, where $|\\sigma|$ is the cardinality of the set $\\sigma$. A simplex of dimension $k$ is called a $k$-simplex.\nThe **Euler characteristic** of a finite abstract simplicial complex $X$, denoted $\\chi(X)$, is the alternating sum of the number of simplices of each dimension:\n$$ \\chi(X) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^k n_k $$\nwhere $n_k$ is the number of $k$-simplices in $X$.\n\nThe given graph is $G=(V,E)$ with vertex set $V=\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ and edge set $E=\\{(1,2),(2,3),(1,3),(3,4)\\}$.\n\nOur first step is to identify all cliques in $G$. These will be the simplices of the clique complex $X(G)$. We find them by systematically checking subsets of $V$ for the clique property.\n\n**Cliques of size 1 ($0$-simplices):**\nAny single vertex forms a clique. The cliques of size $1$ are:\n{1}, {2}, {3}, {4}.\nThese are the four $0$-simplices of $X(G)$. The number of $0$-simplices is $n_0 = 4$.\n\n**Cliques of size 2 ($1$-simplices):**\nA clique of size $2$ is simply an edge. The edges in $E$ are:\n{1,2}, {2,3}, {1,3}, {3,4}.\nThese are the four $1$-simplices of $X(G)$. The number of $1$-simplices is $n_1 = 4$. Note that these vertex sets correspond directly to the edges given in $E$.\n\n**Cliques of size 3 ($2$-simplices):**\nA clique of size $3$ is a triangle, i.e., a set of three vertices where all three possible edges between them exist. We examine all subsets of $V$ of size $3$:\n- $\\{1,2,3\\}$: The edges are $(1,2)$, $(2,3)$, and $(1,3)$. All three are in $E$. Thus, $\\{1,2,3\\}$ is a clique.\n- $\\{1,2,4\\}$: The edge $(1,4)$ is not in $E$. Not a clique.\n- $\\{1,3,4\\}$: The edge $(1,4)$ is not in $E$. Not a clique.\n- $\\{2,3,4\\}$: The edge $(2,4)$ is not in $E$. Not a clique.\nTherefore, there is only one clique of size $3$: $\\{1,2,3\\}$. This is the only $2$-simplex in $X(G)$. The number of $2$-simplices is $n_2 = 1$.\n\n**Cliques of size 4 ($3$-simplices):**\nA clique of size $4$ would require all $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ pairs of vertices to be connected. The only subset of $V$ of size $4$ is $V$ itself, $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$. This is not a clique because, for instance, the edge $(1,4)$ is not in $E$. Thus, there are no cliques of size $4$ or greater. The number of $3$-simplices is $n_3 = 0$, and $n_k = 0$ for all $k \\ge 3$.\n\nThe abstract simplicial complex $X(G)$ is the collection of all these cliques:\n$$ X(G) = \\{ \\{1\\}, \\{2\\}, \\{3\\}, \\{4\\}, \\{1,2\\}, \\{1,3\\}, \\{2,3\\}, \\{3,4\\}, \\{1,2,3\\} \\} $$\nThis collection is indeed an abstract simplicial complex because any subset of a clique is also a clique. For example, $\\{1,2\\}$ is a subset of the simplex $\\{1,2,3\\}$, and $\\{1,2\\}$ is itself a simplex in $X(G)$.\n\nNow we enumerate the simplices by dimension:\n- Number of $0$-simplices: $n_0 = 4$\n- Number of $1$-simplices: $n_1 = 4$\n- Number of $2$-simplices: $n_2 = 1$\n- Number of $k$-simplices for $k \\ge 3$: $n_k = 0$\n\nFinally, we compute the Euler characteristic $\\chi(X(G))$ using its definition:\n$$ \\chi(X(G)) = n_0 - n_1 + n_2 - n_3 + \\dots $$\nSubstituting the values we found:\n$$ \\chi(X(G)) = 4 - 4 + 1 - 0 + 0 - \\dots $$\n$$ \\chi(X(G)) = 1 $$\nThe Euler characteristic of the clique complex $X(G)$ is $1$.",

Define a filtration parameter $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, and for each threshold $t$ construct a simplicial complex as follows: include all vertices (as $0$-simplices) at $t=0$, include an edge $(i,j)$ (as a $1$-simplex) if and only if $w(i,j) \\le t$, and include a $2$-simplex on any triple of vertices if and only if all three of its edges are present at threshold $t$ (i.e., take the clique complex, also called the flag complex, at each threshold).

For any value of $t$, the corresponding simplicial complex, denoted $K_t$, is the clique complex (or flag complex) of the graph containing all vertices and all edges with weight less than or equal to $t$.

Specifically for this problem, a $2$-simplex $\\{i,j,k\\}$ is included if and only if the three edges $\\{i,j\\}$, $\\{j,k\\}$, and $\\{k,i\\}$ are all present.\n\nWe are interested in the first homology group, $H_1(K_t)$, which is defined as the quotient of the group of $1$-cycles, $Z_1(K_t)$, by the group of $1$-boundaries, $B_1(K_t)$. A persistent homology class is born when a new cycle appears that is not a boundary. It dies when it becomes the boundary of a higher-dimensional simplex (in this case, a $2$-chain). We will track the dimension of $H_1(K_t)$, which is the first Betti number $\\beta_1(K_t)$, as $t$ increases through the critical values given by the edge weights: $2$, $3$, $4$, and $5$.\n\n1.  For $t \\in [0, 2)$: The complex $K_t$ contains only the four vertices $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ as $0$-simplices. There are no $1$-simplices. The group of $1$-chains $C_1(K_t)$ is trivial. Therefore, the group of $1$-cycles $Z_1(K_t)$ is also trivial. The first homology group is $H_1(K_t) = \\{0\\}$, and its dimension is $\\beta_1(K_t)=0$.\n\n2.  At $t=2$: The edge $\\{1,2\\}$ with weight $w(1,2)=2$ is added. The complex $K_2$ now contains this single $1$-simplex. There are no cycles, so $Z_1(K_2)=\\{0\\}$. The homology group $H_1(K_2)$ remains trivial, and $\\beta_1(K_2)=0$.\n\n3.  At $t=3$: The edge $\\{2,3\\}$ with weight $w(2,3)=3$ is added. The complex $K_3$ contains the edges $\\{1,2\\}$ and $\\{2,3\\}$, forming a path. There are still no cycles, so $Z_1(K_3)=\\{0\\}$. The homology group $H_1(K_3)$ is trivial, and $\\beta_1(K_3)=0$.\n\n4.  At $t=4$: The edge $\\{3,4\\}$ with weight $w(3,4)=4$ is added. The complex $K_4$ contains the edges $\\{1,2\\}$, $\\{2,3\\}$, and $\\{3,4\\}$, forming a longer path. There are still no cycles, so $Z_1(K_4)=\\{0\\}$. The homology group $H_1(K_4)$ is trivial, and $\\beta_1(K_4)=0$.\n\n5.  At $t=5$: The edge $\\{4,1\\}$ with weight $w(4,1)=5$ is added. The complex $K_5$ now contains all four edges: $\\{1,2\\}, \\{2,3\\}, \\{3,4\\}, \\{4,1\\}$. These edges form a closed loop. Let us define a $1$-chain $c$ by orienting these edges, for example, as $c = (1,2) + (2,3) + (3,4) + (4,1)$. The boundary of this chain is:\n    $$ \\partial_1 c = \\partial_1((1,2) + (2,3) + (3,4) + (4,1)) = (2-1) + (3-2) + (4-3) + (1-4) = 0 $$\n    Since the boundary of $c$ is zero, $c$ is a $1$-cycle, and it is an element of $Z_1(K_5)$. This is the first point in the filtration where a non-trivial $1$-cycle is formed. Thus, a new $H_1$ homology class is **born** at $t=5$. The birth time is $b=5$.\n\n    To determine if this cycle represents a non-trivial homology class, we must examine the boundary group $B_1(K_5) = \\partial_2(C_2(K_5))$. $C_2(K_5)$ is the group of $2$-chains, which are formal sums of $2$-simplices. According to the clique complex rule, a $2$-simplex like $\\{1,2,3\\}$ is included only if all three edges $\\{1,2\\}$, $\\{2,3\\}$, and $\\{1,3\\}$ are in $K_5$. However, the edge set of the original graph does not include edges $\\{1,3\\}$ or $\\{2,4\\}$. Therefore, no set of three vertices in $V$ is fully connected by edges at $t=5$ (or at any $t$, since no other edges are ever added). This means no $2$-simplices are ever formed in this filtration.\n    The set of $2$-simplices is empty, so the chain group $C_2(K_5)$ is trivial. Consequently, the boundary group $B_1(K_5) = \\partial_2(\\{0\\}) = \\{0\\}$.\n    The first homology group at this stage is $H_1(K_5) = Z_1(K_5) / B_1(K_5) \\cong Z_1(K_5)$. Since $Z_1(K_5)$ is generated by the cycle $c$, the dimension of $H_1(K_5)$ is $\\beta_1(K_5)=1$. The cycle $c$ represents a non-trivial homology class.\n\n6.  For $t > 5$: The problem states that there are \"no other edges present\". This implies that for any $t' > 5$, the simplicial complex does not change, i.e., $K_{t'} = K_5$. Since no new simplices of any dimension are added, the homology groups remain static for all $t \\ge 5$. The $1$-dimensional homology class that was born at $t=5$ is never killed, because killing it would require the cycle $c$ to become the boundary of a $2$-chain, and no $2$-simplices are ever formed.\n    Therefore, the death time for this homology class is $d = +\\infty$.\n\nThe filtration yields a single persistent $H_1$ homology class with the birth-death pair $(b,d) = (5, +\\infty)$.\nThe bar length is defined as the death time minus the birth time:\n$$ \\text{Bar Length} = d - b = +\\infty - 5 = \\infty $$\nThere is only one bar length corresponding to the $H_1$ persistence diagram.",
