While a static network may appear dense with triangular clusters, many of these may be artifacts of time-aggregation, representing connections that never formed a causally valid pathway for information or influence.

            "problem": "Consider a temporal network of instantaneous, undirected contacts on the node set $V=\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ observed over the time interval $[0,10]$. A contact is represented as a triple $(i,j,t)$ indicating that nodes $i$ and $j$ were in contact at time $t$. The provided contact sequence is\n$(1,2,1)$, $(2,3,2)$, $(1,3,3)$, $(1,4,4)$, $(2,3,5)$, $(1,2,6)$, $(1,3,7)$, $(2,4,8)$.\nDefine the time-aggregated graph as the simple, undirected graph on $V$ obtained by placing an edge between nodes $i$ and $j$ if at least one contact $(i,j,t)$ occurs in the observation window.

A temporal motif of interest is the time-respecting triangle: a time-respecting sequence of length $3$ whose three contacts involve exactly the three distinct pairs among a single triplet of nodes $\\{a,b,c\\}$, with strictly increasing times and with the motif duration bounded by a tolerance parameter, specifically $t_{3}-t_{1}\\leq \\tau$, where $\\tau0$ is a given time scale.

            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of two distinct quantities related to triangle structures in a temporal network, followed by the calculation of their ratio. The first quantity is the number of static triangles in the time-aggregated graph, and the second is the number of time-respecting triangle motifs under a specific duration constraint.\n\nThe node set is given as $V = \\{1,2,3,4\\}$. The temporal network is defined by a sequence of instantaneous contacts over the time interval $[0,10]$:\n$$C = \\{(1,2,1), (2,3,2), (1,3,3), (1,4,4), (2,3,5), (1,2,6), (1,3,7), (2,4,8)\\}$$\nwhere a contact is a tuple $(i,j,t)$. For clarity, we can list the contacts in chronological order:\n$c_1 = (1,2,1)$\n$c_2 = (2,3,2)$\n$c_3 = (1,3,3)$\n$c_4 = (1,4,4)$\n$c_5 = (2,3,5)$\n$c_6 = (1,2,6)$\n$c_7 = (1,3,7)$\n$c_8 = (2,4,8)$\n\n**Part 1: Static Triangle Count**\n\nFirst, we construct the time-aggregated graph, $G_{\\text{agg}} = (V, E_{\\text{agg}})$. An edge $(i,j)$ exists in $E_{\\text{agg}}$ if there is at least one contact $(i,j,t)$ in the given sequence. By inspecting the contact list, we identify the unique interacting pairs:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Pair $\\{1,2\\}$: contacts at $t=1$ and $t=6$. Edge $(1,2) \\in E_{\\text{agg}}$.\n    \\item Pair $\\{2,3\\}$: contacts at $t=2$ and $t=5$. Edge $(2,3) \\in E_{\\text{agg}}$.\n    \\item Pair $\\{1,3\\}$: contacts at $t=3$ and $t=7$. Edge $(1,3) \\in E_{\\text{agg}}$.\n    \\item Pair $\\{1,4\\}$: contact at $t=4$. Edge $(1,4) \\in E_{\\text{agg}}$.\n    \\item Pair $\\{2,4\\}$: contact at $t=8$. Edge $(2,4) \\in E_{\\text{agg}}$.\n    \\item Pair $\\{3,4\\}$: no contacts. Edge $(3,4) \\notin E_{\\text{agg}}$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe edge set of the aggregated graph is therefore $E_{\\text{agg}} = \\{(1,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4)\\}$.\n\nA static triangle is a set of three nodes $\\{a,b,c\\} \\subseteq V$ such that all three edges $(a,b)$, $(b,c)$, and $(c,a)$ are present in $E_{\\text{agg}}$. We examine all possible 3-node subsets from $V$:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Triplet $\\{1,2,3\\}$: The required edges are $(1,2)$, $(2,3)$, and $(1,3)$. All three edges are in $E_{\\text{agg}}$. Thus, $\\{1,2,3\\}$ forms a static triangle.\n    \\item Triplet $\\{1,2,4\\}$: The required edges are $(1,2)$, $(2,4)$, and $(1,4)$. All three edges are in $E_{\\text{agg}}$. Thus, $\\{1,2,4\\}$ forms a static triangle.\n    \\item Triplet $\\{1,3,4\\}$: The required edges are $(1,3)$, $(3,4)$, and $(1,4)$. The edge $(3,4)$ is not in $E_{\\text{agg}}$. This is not a triangle.\n    \\item Triplet $\\{2,3,4\\}$: The required edges are $(2,3)$, $(3,4)$, and $(2,4)$. The edge $(3,4)$ is not in $E_{\\text{agg}}$. This is not a triangle.\n\\end{enumerate}\nThe total count of static triangles is $2$.\n\n**Part 2: Temporal Triangle Motif Count**\n\nA time-respecting triangle motif is defined as a time-respecting sequence of three contacts, $(i_1,j_1,t_1), (i_2,j_2,t_2), (i_3,j_3,t_3)$, satisfying:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item The times are strictly increasing: $t_1  t_2  t_3$.\n    \\item The contacts involve the three distinct pairs of a single 3-node set $\\{a,b,c\\}$. That is, the set of edges $\\{\\{i_1,j_1\\}, \\{i_2,j_2\\}, \\{i_3,j_3\\}\\}$ is exactly $\\{\\{a,b\\}, \\{b,c\\}, \\{c,a\\}\\}$.\n    \\item The duration is bounded: $t_3 - t_1 \\leq \\tau$, where $\\tau=3$.\n\\end{enumerate}\nA temporal triangle can only exist on a set of nodes that forms a static triangle. Therefore, we only need to investigate the node triplets $\\{1,2,3\\}$ and $\\{1,2,4\\}$.\n\n**Case A: Triplet $\\{1,2,4\\}$**\nThe contacts involving these nodes are $c_1=(1,2,1)$, $c_4=(1,4,4)$, $c_6=(1,2,6)$, and $c_8=(2,4,8)$. To form a triangle on $\\{1,2,4\\}$, a sequence must include a contact on each of the pairs $\\{1,2\\}$, $\\{1,4\\}$, and $\\{2,4\\}$.\nThe only contact for edge $(2,4)$ is $c_8$ at $t=8$. Thus, for any such motif, $t_3$ must be $8$. The constraint $t_3 - t_1 \\leq 3$ implies $8 - t_1 \\leq 3$, which requires $t_1 \\geq 5$.\nHowever, the contacts available for the other two edges, $(1,2)$ and $(1,4)$, all occur before $t=5$. Specifically, we have $(1,2,1)$ and $(1,4,4)$. So, it is impossible to form a time-respecting sequence $(c_a, c_b, c_c)$ where $c_c = c_8=(2,4,8)$ and $t(c_a) \\geq 5$.\nAlternatively, consider potential sequences:\n- Sequence using $(1,2,1)$, $(1,4,4)$, $(2,4,8)$: The time-ordered sequence is $((1,2,1), (1,4,4), (2,4,8))$. Here, $t_1=1, t_2=4, t_3=8$. The duration is $t_3-t_1=7$, which is greater than $\\tau=3$.\n- Sequence using $(1,2,6)$, $(1,4,4)$, $(2,4,8)$: The time-ordered sequence is $((1,4,4), (1,2,6), (2,4,8))$. Here, $t_1=4, t_2=6, t_3=8$. The duration is $t_3-t_1=4$, which is greater than $\\tau=3$.\nTherefore, there are no time-respecting triangle motifs on the node set $\\{1,2,4\\}$.\n\n**Case B: Triplet $\\{1,2,3\\}$**\nThe contacts involving these nodes are $c_1=(1,2,1)$, $c_2=(2,3,2)$, $c_3=(1,3,3)$, $c_5=(2,3,5)$, $c_6=(1,2,6)$, and $c_7=(1,3,7)$.\nWe systematically search for ordered triplets of contacts from this subset that satisfy the conditions.\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Sequence $((1,2,1), (2,3,2), (1,3,3))$:\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item Times: $t_1=1, t_2=2, t_3=3$. These are strictly increasing.\n        \\item Edges: The contacts correspond to pairs $\\{1,2\\}$, $\\{2,3\\}$, and $\\{1,3\\}$, forming a triangle on $\\{1,2,3\\}$.\n        \\item Duration: $t_3-t_1 = 3-1=2$. Since $2 \\leq \\tau=3$, this is a valid temporal motif.\n    \\end{itemize}\n    \\item Sequence $((1,3,3), (2,3,5), (1,2,6))$:\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item Times: $t_1=3, t_2=5, t_3=6$. These are strictly increasing.\n        \\item Edges: The contacts correspond to pairs $\\{1,3\\}$, $\\{2,3\\}$, and $\\{1,2\\}$, forming a triangle on $\\{1,2,3\\}$.\n        \\item Duration: $t_3-t_1 = 6-3=3$. Since $3 \\leq \\tau=3$, this is a valid temporal motif.\n    \\end{itemize}\n    \\item Sequence $((2,3,5), (1,2,6), (1,3,7))$:\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item Times: $t_1=5, t_2=6, t_3=7$. These are strictly increasing.\n        \\item Edges: The contacts correspond to pairs $\\{2,3\\}$, $\\{1,2\\}$, and $\\{1,3\\}$, forming a triangle on $\\{1,2,3\\}$.\n        \\item Duration: $t_3-t_1 = 7-5=2$. Since $2 \\leq \\tau=3$, this is a valid temporal motif.\n    \\end{itemize}\n\\end{enumerate}\nA thorough check of all other possible combinations of three contacts on $\\{1,2,3\\}$ reveals no other sequences that satisfy all criteria. For example, the sequence $((1,2,1), (1,3,3), (2,3,5))$ has duration $5-1=4 > 3$. The sequence $((2,3,2), (1,2,6), (1,3,7))$ has duration $7-2=5 > 3$.\nThe total count of time-respecting triangle motifs is $3$.\n\n**Part 3: The Ratio $R$**\n\nThe ratio $R$ is defined as the temporal triangle count divided by the static triangle count.\n$$R = \\frac{\\text{temporal triangle count}}{\\text{static triangle count}}$$\nSubstituting the computed values:\n$$R = \\frac{3}{2}$$\nThe ratio is an exact fraction and is already in its simplest form.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for the total number of distinct time-respecting paths of length $2$ from node $1$ to node $5$ in a time-resolved network defined by two adjacency matrices $A^{(1)}$ and $A^{(2)}$ at strictly ordered times $t_1  t_2$.\n\nFirst, we must establish from first principles what constitutes such a path. A path of length $2$ from a starting node $u_0$ to an ending node $u_2$ is defined by a sequence of nodes $(u_0, u_1, u_2)$, where $u_1$ is an intermediate node. This corresponds to two concatenated directed edges, $(u_0 \\to u_1)$ and $(u_1 \\to u_2)$.\n\nThe problem introduces a temporal constraint. A time-respecting path of length $2$ must use its first edge at time $t_1$ and its second edge at time $t_2$. Let the desired path be from node $u=1$ to node $v=5$. Such a path can be represented by the sequence $(1, m, 5)$, where $m$ is an intermediate node from the set of all nodes $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. For this sequence to represent a valid time-respecting path, two conditions must be met simultaneously:\n1. The edge $(1 \\to m)$ must exist at time $t_1$.\n2. The edge $(m \\to 5)$ must exist at time $t_2$.\n\nThe existence of a directed edge from a node $u$ to a node $v$ at a specific time $t_{\\ell}$ is encoded in the corresponding adjacency matrix $A^{(\\ell)}$. Specifically, the entry $A^{(\\ell)}_{uv} = 1$ if the edge $(u \\to v)$ exists at time $t_{\\ell}$, and $A^{(\\ell)}_{uv} = 0$ otherwise.\n\nApplying this to our conditions:\n1. The existence of edge $(1 \\to m)$ at time $t_1$ is equivalent to the condition $A^{(1)}_{1m} = 1$.\n2. The existence of edge $(m \\to 5)$ at time $t_2$ is equivalent to the condition $A^{(2)}_{m5} = 1$.\n\nFor any single intermediate node $m$, a path of the form $1 \\xrightarrow{t_1} m \\xrightarrow{t_2} 5$ exists if and only if both $A^{(1)}_{1m} = 1$ and $A^{(2)}_{m5} = 1$. Since the entries of the adjacency matrices are binary ($0$ or $1$), the product $A^{(1)}_{1m} A^{(2)}_{m5}$ is equal to $1$ if both conditions are met, and $0$ otherwise. Thus, this product counts the number of distinct time-respecting paths of length $2$ from node $1$ to node $5$ that pass through the specific intermediate node $m$.\n\nTo find the total number of distinct time-respecting paths of length $2$ from node $1$ to node $5$, which we denote as $N_{1 \\to 5}$, we must sum the contributions from all possible intermediate nodes. The set of intermediate nodes consists of all nodes in the network, so $m \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. The total count is therefore the sum over all possible values of $m$:\n$$\nN_{1 \\to 5} = \\sum_{m=1}^{5} A^{(1)}_{1m} A^{(2)}_{m5}\n$$\nThis expression, derived from the fundamental definitions of paths and adjacency matrices, gives the total number of paths we seek.\n\nNext, we address why this expression naturally coincides with a particular entry of a matrix product. The definition of the product of two $n \\times n$ matrices, say $P$ and $Q$, is given by $(PQ)_{ij} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} P_{ik} Q_{kj}$. Let us consider the matrix product $M = A^{(1)} A^{(2)}$. The entry in the $1$-st row and $5$-th column of this product matrix, which we denote as $M_{15}$, is calculated as:\n$$\nM_{15} = (A^{(1)}A^{(2)})_{15} = \\sum_{m=1}^{5} A^{(1)}_{1m} A^{(2)}_{m5}\n$$\nThis is precisely the same summation we derived from first principles for the total number of time-respecting paths of length $2$ from node $1$ to node $5$. Therefore, the desired quantity is the $(1,5)$-entry of the matrix product $A^{(1)}A^{(2)}$. This result is a cornerstone of network analysis, where powers of an adjacency matrix, or products of different adjacency matrices in a temporal context, enumerate paths of corresponding lengths.\n\nFinally, we compute the exact number using the given matrices:\n$$\nA^{(1)} \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix}\n0  1  1  0  0\\\\\n0  0  1  1  0\\\\\n0  0  0  1  0\\\\\n0  0  0  0  1\\\\\n1  0  0  0  0\n\\end{pmatrix},\n\\qquad\nA^{(2)} \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix}\n0  0  1  0  1\\\\\n0  0  0  0  1\\\\\n0  1  0  0  1\\\\\n1  0  0  0  1\\\\\n0  0  0  1  0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nTo calculate $N_{1 \\to 5} = (A^{(1)}A^{(2)})_{15}$, we require the $1$-st row of $A^{(1)}$ and the $5$-th column of $A^{(2)}$.\nThe $1$-st row of $A^{(1)}$ is $(A^{(1)}_{11}, A^{(1)}_{12}, A^{(1)}_{13}, A^{(1)}_{14}, A^{(1)}_{15}) = (0, 1, 1, 0, 0)$.\nThe $5$-th column of $A^{(2)}$ is $(A^{(2)}_{15}, A^{(2)}_{25}, A^{(2)}_{35}, A^{(2)}_{45}, A^{(2)}_{55}) = (1, 1, 1, 1, 0)$.\n\nWe now compute the sum of the element-wise products:\n$$\nN_{1 \\to 5} = \\sum_{m=1}^{5} A^{(1)}_{1m} A^{(2)}_{m5} = A^{(1)}_{11}A^{(2)}_{15} + A^{(1)}_{12}A^{(2)}_{25} + A^{(1)}_{13}A^{(2)}_{35} + A^{(1)}_{14}A^{(2)}_{45} + A^{(1)}_{15}A^{(2)}_{55}\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\nN_{1 \\to 5} = (0)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (0)(1) + (0)(0)\n$$\n$$\nN_{1 \\to 5} = 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 2\n$$\nThe calculation yields exactly $2$. The two paths are:\n1. $1 \\xrightarrow{t_1} 2 \\xrightarrow{t_2} 5$, corresponding to the term $A^{(1)}_{12}A^{(2)}_{25} = 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n2. $1 \\xrightarrow{t_1} 3 \\xrightarrow{t_2} 5$, corresponding to the term $A^{(1)}_{13}A^{(2)}_{35} = 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\nNo intermediate step required approximation, so the final result is exact.",

Thus the aggregated degrees are:\n$\\deg_{\\bar A}(v)=2$ (neighbors $b$ and $d$), $\\deg_{\\bar A}(a)=2$ (neighbors $b$ and $c$), $\\deg_{\\bar A}(b)=3$ (neighbors $a$, $c$, $v$), $\\deg_{\\bar A}(c)=3$ (neighbors $a$, $b$, $d$), $\\deg_{\\bar A}(d)=3$ (neighbors $v$, $e$, $c$), $\\deg_{\\bar A}(e)=1$ (neighbor $d$). Node $v$ indeed has low aggregated degree relative to nodes $b$, $c$, and $d$.\n\nWe now evaluate earliest-arrival time-respecting paths, focusing on cross-community pairs where $S_1=\\{a,b,c\\}$ and $S_2=\\{d,e\\}$.\n\nFrom $S_1$ to $S_2$: The sequence of contacts $(b,v)$ at $t=3$ and $(v,d)$ at $t=4$ creates a fast path.\n- For $a\\to d$, the path $a \\xrightarrow{t=1} b \\xrightarrow{t=3} v \\xrightarrow{t=4} d$ arrives at $t=4$.\n- For $b\\to d$, the path $b \\xrightarrow{t=3} v \\xrightarrow{t=4} d$ arrives at $t=4$.\n- For $c\\to d$, the path $c \\xrightarrow{t=2} b \\xrightarrow{t=3} v \\xrightarrow{t=4} d$ arrives at $t=4$.\nThe alternative is to use the $(c,d)$ contact at $t=11$. Any path using this arrives at $d$ no earlier than $t=11$. Thus, for all paths from a node in $S_1$ to node $d$, the earliest path goes through $v$. The same holds for paths to $e$, which must pass through $d$ first, arriving at $e$ at $t=5$ via the path through $v$. Therefore, $v$ lies on all 6 earliest-arrival geodesics from $S_1$ to $S_2$.\n\nFrom $S_2$ to $S_1$: The reverse sequence $(d,v)$ at $t=9$ and $(v,b)$ at $t=10$ creates a path.\n- $d \\to b$: The path $d \\xrightarrow{t=9} v \\xrightarrow{t=10} b$ arrives at $t=10$. An alternative $d \\xrightarrow{t=11} c \\xrightarrow{t=14} b$ arrives at $t=14$. The path via $v$ is earliest.\n- $d \\to a$: The path $d \\xrightarrow{t=9} v \\xrightarrow{t=10} b \\xrightarrow{t=13} a$ arrives at $t=13$. An alternative $d \\xrightarrow{t=11} c \\xrightarrow{t=15} a$ arrives at $t=15$. The path via $v$ is earliest.\n- $d \\to c$: The path $d \\xrightarrow{t=9} v \\xrightarrow{t=10} b \\xrightarrow{t=14} c$ arrives at $t=14$. However, the direct contact $(d,c)$ at $t=11$ gives a path that arrives at $t=11$. In this case, the path via $v$ is not the earliest.\nThe same logic applies to paths from $e$, which must first use $(e,d)$ at $t=5$. Paths $e \\to a$ and $e \\to b$ are fastest via $v$. The path $e \\to c$ is fastest via the $(d,c)$ contact at $t=11$.\n\nIn summary, $v$ lies on all 6 earliest paths from $S_1 \\to S_2$ and on 4 of the 6 earliest paths from $S_2 \\to S_1$. This gives $v$ a high betweenness score from 10 cross-community pairs. No other node serves as such a consistent intermediary. Thus, despite not being on *every* cross-community path, its role as a temporal gatekeeper for the majority of them makes its temporal betweenness maximal in this construction.\n\nVerdict for A: Correct. The core mechanism holds, making $v$ maximally central, even if the description in the option is slightly overstated.\n\n**Option B:**\nAggregated edges include $(v,a), (v,b), (v,c), (v,d)$, so $\\deg_{\\bar A}(v)=4$. This is not low, failing a primary condition of the problem.\n\nVerdict for B: Incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\nAggregated edges include $(v,d)$, so $\\deg_{\\bar A}(v)=1$. This is a low degree. However, a node with degree 1 can only be an endpoint of any path passing through it, never an *interior* node between two other distinct nodes. Therefore, its temporal betweenness centrality is 0.\n\nVerdict for C: Incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\nAggregated degree is $\\deg_{\\bar A}(v)=2$, which is low. However, the path from community $S_1$ to $S_2$ via $v$ requires the sequence $(b,v)$ then $(v,d)$. The contacts are timed at $t=6$ and $t=3$ respectively. Since a time-respecting path requires strictly increasing times, a path $b \\to v \\to d$ is not possible ($6 \\not 3$). The alternative path via $(c,d)$ at $t=4$ is viable (e.g., $b \\xrightarrow{t=2} c \\xrightarrow{t=4} d$). Node $v$ does not act as a bridge.\n\nVerdict for D: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, only Option A correctly provides a construction and a valid (though slightly overstated) mechanism where a low-degree node achieves maximal temporal betweenness. It perfectly illustrates the principle that temporal ordering, not static connectivity, can determine a node's importance.",
