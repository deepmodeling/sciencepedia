            "problem": "Consider a food web on $5$ species modeled as a directed graph with node set $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$. By convention, draw a directed edge from prey to predator: that is, there is a directed edge $i \\to j$ if species $j$ consumes species $i$. The directed adjacency matrix $A$ is defined entrywise by $A_{ij} = 1$ if there is a directed edge $i \\to j$ and $A_{ij} = 0$ otherwise. The in-degree of node $j$, denoted $k_{\\mathrm{in}}(j)$, is the number of incoming edges to $j$ (equivalently, the number of prey species consumed by $j$) and equals $\\sum_{i=1}^{5} A_{ij}$. The out-degree of node $i$, denoted $k_{\\mathrm{out}}(i)$, is the number of outgoing edges from $i$ (equivalently, the number of predators of $i$) and equals $\\sum_{j=1}^{5} A_{ij}$. A species is basal if its in-degree is zero, and a species is apex if its out-degree is zero, under this prey-to-predator orientation.\n\nThe $5$ species are labeled as follows for convenience: $1$ (primary producer), $2$ (herbivore), $3$ (omnivorous invertebrate), $4$ (small fish), $5$ (seabird). The observed consumption interactions are:\n- Species $2$ consumes species $1$.\n- Species $3$ consumes species $1$ and species $2$.\n- Species $4$ consumes species $2$ and species $3$.\n- Species $5$ consumes species $3$ and species $4$.\n\nTasks:\n- Construct the adjacency matrix $A$ under the prey-to-predator edge orientation described above, using the node ordering $(1,2,3,4,5)$.\n- Compute $k_{\\mathrm{in}}(j)$ and $k_{\\mathrm{out}}(i)$ for each node $i,j \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$.\n- Identify all basal and apex species under this orientation.\n- Let $B$ denote the number of basal species and $P$ denote the number of apex species.

The counting method is explicitly stated. A unique integer solution for the given matrix exists. The problem is well-posed.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using formal mathematical language and definitions, free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Combinatorial Expression\n\nA feedforward loop is defined by an ordered triple of distinct species $(i, j, k)$ such that three specific trophic links exist: $i \\to j$, $j \\to k$, and $i \\to k$. In terms of the adjacency matrix $A$, these three conditions correspond to:\n$1.$ $A_{ij} = 1$\n$2.$ $A_{jk} = 1$\n$3.$ $A_{ik} = 1$\n\nThe total number of FFLs, which we denote as $N_{FFL}$, is the count of all such ordered triples $(i,j,k)$ that satisfy these three conditions and the distinctness condition ($i \\neq j, j \\neq k, i \\neq k$). We can write this count as a sum over all possible species indices:\n$$\nN_{FFL} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n \\sum_{k=1}^n A_{ij} A_{jk} A_{ik} \\cdot \\delta_{i,j,k}^{\\text{distinct}}\n$$\nwhere $\\delta_{i,j,k}^{\\text{distinct}}$ is an indicator that is $1$ if $i, j, k$ are all distinct, and $0$ otherwise.\n\nThe problem states that there are no self-loops, i.e., $A_{ll} = 0$ for all $l_$. Let's analyze the sum $\\sum_{i,j,k} A_{ij} A_{jk} A_{ik}$ without the explicit distinctness condition.\n- If $i=j$, the term is $A_{ii} A_{ik} A_{ik} = 0 \\cdot A_{ik} A_{ik} = 0$.\n- If $j=k$, the term is $A_{ij} A_{jj} A_{ij} = A_{ij} \\cdot 0 \\cdot A_{ij} = 0$.\n- If $i=k$, the term is $A_{ij} A_{ji} A_{ii} = A_{ij} A_{ji} \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n- If $i=j=k$, the term is $A_{ii} A_{ii} A_{ii} = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the no-self-loop condition $A_{ll}=0$ automatically ensures that any non-zero term in the sum must correspond to a triple $(i,j,k)$ with distinct indices. The expression for $N_{FFL}$ simplifies to:\n$$\nN_{FFL} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n \\sum_{k=1}^n A_{ij} A_{jk} A_{ik}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the expression to be in terms of $A$ and $A^2$. The element at row $i$ and column $k$ of the matrix $A^2 = A \\cdot A$ is defined as:\n$$\n(A^2)_{ik} = \\sum_{j=1}^n A_{ij} A_{jk}\n$$\nThis sum counts the number of directed paths of length $2$ from species $i$ to species $k$.\n\nWe can rearrange the summation for $N_{FFL}$ to use this definition:\n$$\nN_{FFL} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{k=1}^n \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^n A_{ij} A_{jk} \\right) A_{ik}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $(A^2)_{ik}$, we obtain the desired combinatorial expression:\n$$\nN_{FFL} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{k=1}^n (A^2)_{ik} A_{ik}\n$$\nThis expression represents the sum of element-wise products of the matrices $A^2$ and $A$. Each term $(A^2)_{ik} A_{ik}$ counts the number of FFLs where the 'source' is $i$ and the 'sink' is $k$. The term $A_{ik}$ ensures a direct link exists, and the term $(A^2)_{ik}$ counts the number of intermediate species $j$ that form the two-step path $i \\to j \\to k$.\n\n### Evaluation for the Given Matrix\n\nWe are given the adjacency matrix:\n$$\nA \\;=\\;\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0  1  1  1  1  1 \\\\\n0  0  1  1  1  1 \\\\\n0  0  0  1  1  1 \\\\\n0  0  1  0  1  1 \\\\\n0  0  0  1  0  1 \\\\\n0  1  0  0  0  0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFirst, we compute $A^2 = A \\cdot A$:\n$$\nA^2 =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0  1  1  1  1  1 \\\\\n0  0  1  1  1  1 \\\\\n0  0  0  1  1  1 \\\\\n0  0  1  0  1  1 \\\\\n0  0  0  1  0  1 \\\\\n0  1  0  0  0  0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0  1  1  1  1  1 \\\\\n0  0  1  1  1  1 \\\\\n0  0  0  1  1  1 \\\\\n0  0  1  0  1  1 \\\\\n0  0  0  1  0  1 \\\\\n0  1  0  0  0  0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0  1  2  3  3  4 \\\\\n0  1  1  2  2  3 \\\\\n0  1  1  1  1  2 \\\\\n0  1  0  2  1  2 \\\\\n0  1  1  0  1  1 \\\\\n0  0  1  1  1  1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we apply the formula $N_{FFL} = \\sum_{i,k} (A^2)_{ik} A_{ik}$. This means we sum the elements of $A^2$ corresponding to the non-zero (i.e., value $1$) elements of $A$.\n\nThe non-zero elements of $A$ are:\n- Row $1$: $A_{12}, A_{13}, A_{14}, A_{15}, A_{16}$\n- Row $2$: $A_{23}, A_{24}, A_{25}, A_{26}$\n- Row $3$: $A_{34}, A_{35}, A_{36}$\n- Row $4$: $A_{43}, A_{45}, A_{46}$\n- Row $5$: $A_{54}, A_{56}$\n- Row $6$: $A_{62}$\n\nSumming the corresponding elements from $A^2$:\n- From row $1$ of $A$: $(A^2)_{12} + (A^2)_{13} + (A^2)_{14} + (A^2)_{15} + (A^2)_{16} = 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 13$\n- From row $2$ of $A$: $(A^2)_{23} + (A^2)_{24} + (A^2)_{25} + (A^2)_{26} = 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 8$\n- From row $3$ of $A$: $(A^2)_{34} + (A^2)_{35} + (A^2)_{36} = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4$\n- From row $4$ of $A$: $(A^2)_{43} + (A^2)_{45} + (A^2)_{46} = 0 + 1 + 2 = 3$\n- From row $5$ of $A$: $(A^2)_{54} + (A^2)_{56} = 0 + 1 = 1$\n- From row $6$ of $A$: $(A^2)_{62} = 0$\n\nThe total number of feedforward loops is the sum of these values:\n$$\nN_{FFL} = 13 + 8 + 4 + 3 + 1 + 0 = 29\n$$\nThus, there are $29$ feedforward loop occurrences in the given network.",
