            "problem": "Consider a class of networked systems that undergo a continuous phase transition in terms of a control parameter $p$ (for example, a bond occupation probability), at a critical value $p_{c}$. Let $L$ denote a linear measure of the system size (for lattices, linear extent; for networks that do not have a geometric embedding, one may think of $L$ as an effective linear size derived from the number of nodes $N$ and a dimension $d$ via $L \\sim N^{1/d}$ when such a mapping is sensible). Denote by $t = p - p_{c}$ the reduced control parameter. An observable $O(t,L)$ (for example, the fraction of nodes in the giant connected component or a magnetization-like order parameter) is measured across multiple system sizes $L$ and values of $p$ near $p_{c}$.\n\nAs foundational starting points, assume the following widely accepted facts near a continuous transition:\n1. The correlation length $\\xi(t)$ diverges as $|t| \\to 0$ according to $\\xi(t) \\sim |t|^{-\\nu}$ with exponent $\\nu  0$.\n2. In the thermodynamic limit $L \\to \\infty$, the observable behaves as $O_{\\infty}(t) \\sim |t|^{\\beta}$ for $t  0$, with exponent $\\beta  0$.\n3. Finite-size effects arise from the comparison of $L$ to $\\xi(t)$, so the dependence $O(t,L)$ must be expressible in terms of combinations of $t$, $L$, and the exponents that reflect how $L$ cuts off the divergence of $\\xi(t)$.\n\nThe goal is to use these principles to deduce how to test scaling and universality by data collapse: namely, to construct a dimensionless scaling variable and an appropriately rescaled observable so that curves for different $L$ fall onto a single smooth scaling function when plotted against the scaling variable. Evidence for a unique scaling function is then obtained when the same rescaling collapses curves across $L$ or across parameter variations that share the same universality class.\n\nWhich option most correctly defines data collapse, constructs the appropriate scaling variable and rescaled observable from the above principles, and explains how a unique scaling function $\\mathcal{F}$ is evidenced by collapsing curves across $L$ or parameters?\n\nA. Data collapse is the procedure of rescaling the horizontal axis to a dimensionless combination of $t$ and $L$ and rescaling the vertical axis to remove power-law $L$-dependence so that all curves for different $L$ overlay a single function. Using the divergence $\\xi(t) \\sim |t|^{-\\nu}$, the natural dimensionless scaling variable is $x = t \\, L^{1/\\nu}$. Consistency with the infinite-size behavior $O_{\\infty}(t) \\sim |t|^{\\beta}$ implies rescaling the observable as $O(t,L) \\, L^{\\beta/\\nu}$ to produce a collapse onto a single smooth function $\\mathcal{F}(x)$ for multiple $L$. If two distinct rescalings yielded collapses for a continuum of $(t,L)$ values within the same universality class, matching the $L$-dependence and the limit $L \\to \\infty$ forces equality of their exponents and hence equality of the collapsed curves, demonstrating that $\\mathcal{F}$ is unique up to trivial normalization of $O$.\n\nB. Data collapse is achieved by leaving the observable unscaled and rescaling only the control parameter. Because $p/p_{c}$ is dimensionless, one should define $x = (p/p_{c}) \\, L^{\\nu}$ and plot $O(t,L)/L^{\\beta}$ versus $x$. If the curves scatter for different $L$, that scatter is evidence of universality because the same scatter shape is reproduced across systems.\n\nC. Data collapse requires placing the critical exponent for the observable directly into the scaling variable. Therefore one should define $x = t \\, L^{1/\\beta}$ and rescale the observable as $O(t,L) \\, L^{\\nu/\\beta}$ so that curves collapse. The uniqueness of the scaling function follows because exchanging $\\nu$ and $\\beta$ leaves the collapsed curve unchanged.\n\nD. Data collapse does not require rescaling; plotting $O$ against $p$ for various $L$ is sufficient. If the curves for different $L$ cross at a single point near $p_{c}$, that crossing both demonstrates universality and identifies a unique scaling function that governs the entire critical region.",
            "solution": "The Finite-Size Scaling (FSS) hypothesis posits that for a system near a critical point, any appropriately scaled observable must be a function of the dimensionless ratio of the system size $L$ to the correlation length $\\xi$.\n\n1.  **Construct the Scaling Variable:** The scaling variable must be dimensionless. We are given that $\\xi(t) \\sim |t|^{-\\nu}$. The ratio $L/\\xi$ is dimensionless, so $L/\\xi \\sim L|t|^{\\nu}$. Conventionally, the scaling variable $x$ is defined as this ratio raised to the power $1/\\nu$:\n    $$x = t L^{1/\\nu}$$\n    This forms the argument of the universal scaling function, $\\mathcal{F}(x)$.\n\n2.  **Construct the Rescaled Observable:** The FSS ansatz states that the observable can be written as a power of $L$ times the universal function:\n    $$O(t,L) = L^{-\\lambda} \\mathcal{F}(t L^{1/\\nu})$$\n    We need to find the exponent $\\lambda$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Thermodynamic Limit:** We use the given fact that in the infinite system limit ($L \\to \\infty$), the observable scales as $O_{\\infty}(t) \\sim |t|^{\\beta}$. For a fixed $t \\neq 0$, as $L \\to \\infty$, the argument $x \\to \\infty$. For the scaling form to reproduce the thermodynamic limit, the function $\\mathcal{F}(x)$ must behave as a power law for large $x$, i.e., $\\mathcal{F}(x) \\sim x^{\\delta}$ as $x \\to \\infty$. Substituting this into our ansatz:\n    $$O(t,L) \\sim L^{-\\lambda} (t L^{1/\\nu})^{\\delta} = t^{\\delta} L^{\\delta/\\nu - \\lambda}$$\n    For this to match the $L$-independent thermodynamic limit behavior, the exponent of $L$ must be zero: $\\delta/\\nu - \\lambda = 0 \\implies \\delta = \\lambda \\nu$. The observable then scales as $O_{\\infty}(t) \\sim t^{\\delta} = t^{\\lambda \\nu}$.\n\n4.  **Determine the Exponent:** Comparing this result with the known behavior $O_{\\infty}(t) \\sim |t|^{\\beta}$, we equate the exponents: $\\lambda \\nu = \\beta$, which gives $\\lambda = \\beta/\\nu$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion for Data Collapse:** Substituting $\\lambda$ back, the full scaling form is $O(t,L) = L^{-\\beta/\\nu} \\mathcal{F}(t L^{1/\\nu})$. To perform a data collapse, one must plot the rescaled observable $Y = O(t,L)L^{\\beta/\\nu}$ against the scaling variable $x = t L^{1/\\nu}$. All data should fall onto the single universal curve $Y = \\mathcal{F}(x)$.\n\nThis procedure matches option A exactly.
