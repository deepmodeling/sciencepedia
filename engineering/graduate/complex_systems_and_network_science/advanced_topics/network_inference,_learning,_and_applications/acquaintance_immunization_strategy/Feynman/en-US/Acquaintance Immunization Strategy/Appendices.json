            "problem": "Consider a large, undirected, simple network with $N$ nodes, degree distribution $P(k)$, and mean degree $\\langle k \\rangle$. In the acquaintance immunization protocol, a single immunization query proceeds as follows: first select a node uniformly at random from the $N$ nodes, then select one of its neighbors uniformly at random, and immunize that neighbor. Assume queries are conducted independently with replacement, meaning that the network and the sampling mechanism are unaffected by prior immunizations and each query is identically distributed.\n\nUnder the configuration model assumption of negligible degree-degree correlations, derive from first principles an exact expression (in the mean-field sense) for the probability $P_{m}(k)$ that a node of degree $k$ is immunized at least once after $m$ independent queries with replacement. Then obtain a leading-order exponential approximation to $P_{m}(k)$ appropriate for sparse sampling in large networks, and identify the regime in terms of $N$, $k$, and $m$ under which this approximation is accurate, including the magnitude of the leading correction.\n\nYour final answer must consist of the exact mean-field expression and its exponential approximation written as closed-form analytic expressions. No numerical evaluation is required.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the probability $P_{m}(k)$ that a node of degree $k$ is immunized at least once after $m$ independent queries using the acquaintance immunization protocol, along with a leading-order approximation and its regime of validity. The derivation will be performed under the mean-field assumption of a configuration model network with negligible degree-degree correlations.\n\nFirst, we derive the probability, which we denote as $q(k)$, that a specific node of degree $k$ is selected for immunization in a single query. Let the target node be $V$, with degree $\\text{deg}(V) = k$. The acquaintance immunization protocol consists of two steps:\n$1$. A node, let's call it $U$, is selected uniformly at random from the $N$ nodes in the network. The probability of selecting any specific node $U$ is $1/N$.\n$2$. A neighbor of $U$ is selected uniformly at random and is immunized.\n\nFor our target node $V$ to be immunized, the node $U$ selected in step $1$ must be one of its neighbors. Let the set of neighbors of $V$ be $\\mathcal{N}(V)$, where $|\\mathcal{N}(V)|=k$. If a specific neighbor $U_i \\in \\mathcal{N}(V)$ is chosen in step $1$, its degree is $\\text{deg}(U_i)$. In step $2$, for $V$ to be immunized, it must be chosen from the $\\text{deg}(U_i)$ neighbors of $U_i$. The probability of this is $1/\\text{deg}(U_i)$.\n\nThe probability of $V$ being immunized via a specific neighbor $U_i$ is the product of the probabilities of these two independent events: $P(\\text{select } U_i \\text{ then } V) = P(\\text{select } U_i) \\times P(\\text{select } V | U_i \\text{ was chosen}) = \\frac{1}{N} \\times \\frac{1}{\\text{deg}(U_i)}$.\n\nThe total probability $q_V$ that node $V$ is immunized in a single query is the sum of these probabilities over all its neighbors, as these are mutually exclusive events (only one node $U$ is chosen in step $1$):\n$$q_V = \\sum_{U_i \\in \\mathcal{N}(V)} \\frac{1}{N \\cdot \\text{deg}(U_i)} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{1}{\\text{deg}(U_i)}$$\nThis probability depends on the degrees of the specific neighbors of node $V$. The problem asks for $P_m(k)$, which refers to a generic node of degree $k$. We therefore need to compute the expected probability $q(k)$ by averaging $q_V$ over all nodes $V$ of degree $k$.\n$$q(k) = \\left\\langle q_V \\right\\rangle_{\\text{deg}(V)=k} = \\frac{1}{N} \\left\\langle \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{1}{\\text{deg}(U_i)} \\right\\rangle_{\\text{deg}(V)=k}$$\nUnder the configuration model assumption of no degree-degree correlations, the degree of a neighbor of a node is independent of the node's own degree. The probability distribution of a neighbor's degree, $P_{nn}(k')$, is not the overall degree distribution $P(k')$ but is skewed towards higher-degree nodes. This is because a a node of degree $k'$ has $k'$ edges, making it $k'$ times more likely to be a neighbor than a node of degree $1$. The normalized distribution for a neighbor's degree is $P_{nn}(k') = \\frac{k' P(k')}{\\sum_{j} j P(j)} = \\frac{k' P(k')}{\\langle k \\rangle}$.\n\nWe can now compute the expected value of the reciprocal of a neighbor's degree:\n$$\\left\\langle \\frac{1}{\\text{deg}(\\text{neighbor})} \\right\\rangle = \\sum_{k'=1}^{N-1} \\frac{1}{k'} P_{nn}(k') = \\sum_{k'=1}^{N-1} \\frac{1}{k'} \\frac{k' P(k')}{\\langle k \\rangle} = \\frac{1}{\\langle k \\rangle} \\sum_{k'=1}^{N-1} P(k') = \\frac{1}{\\langle k \\rangle}$$\nsince $\\sum P(k') = 1$.\nApplying this mean-field result, the expected value of the sum becomes a sum of expectations:\n$$q(k) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{\\text{deg}(U_i)} \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{1}{\\langle k \\rangle} = \\frac{k}{N \\langle k \\rangle}$$\nThis is the mean-field probability that a node of degree $k$ is immunized in a single query. Note that this probability is proportional to the node's degree $k$, which is the central advantage of the acquaintance immunization strategy.\n\nNow we find $P_m(k)$, the probability of being immunized at least once in $m$ independent queries. It is more convenient to first calculate the probability of *not* being immunized. The probability of not being immunized in one query is $1 - q(k)$. Since all $m$ queries are independent and conducted with replacement, the probability of not being immunized in any of the $m$ queries is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$P(\\text{not immunized in } m \\text{ queries}) = (1 - q(k))^m = \\left(1 - \\frac{k}{N \\langle k \\rangle}\\right)^m$$\nThe probability $P_m(k)$ of being immunized at least once is the complement of this event:\n$$P_m(k) = 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{k}{N \\langle k \\rangle}\\right)^m$$\nThis is the first required result: the exact expression for $P_m(k)$ in the mean-field sense.\n\nNext, we derive the leading-order exponential approximation. This approximation is valid under the condition of \"sparse sampling in large networks,\" which implies that the probability of immunization in a single query is very small. Mathematically, this corresponds to the regime where $q(k) = \\frac{k}{N \\langle k \\rangle} \\ll 1$. This condition is satisfied for large networks ($N \\to \\infty$) as long as $k$ and $\\langle k \\rangle$ are not of order $N$.\nWe use the well-known limit for the exponential function, $(1-x)^m \\approx \\exp(-mx)$, which is the leading-order term in the expansion of $\\exp(m \\ln(1-x))$.\nSetting $x = q(k) = \\frac{k}{N \\langle k \\rangle}$, we get:\n$$P_m(k) = 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{k}{N \\langle k \\rangle}\\right)^m \\approx 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mk}{N \\langle k \\rangle}\\right)$$\nThis is the second required result: the leading-order exponential approximation.\n\nFinally, we analyze the regime of validity and the leading correction. The approximation is derived from the Taylor series of the natural logarithm: $\\ln(1-x) = -x - \\frac{x^2}{2} - \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\dots$.\nThen, $(1-x)^m = \\exp(m\\ln(1-x)) = \\exp\\left(m\\left(-x - \\frac{x^2}{2} - O(x^3)\\right)\\right) = \\exp(-mx) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mx^2}{2}\\right) \\exp\\left(-O(mx^3)\\right)$.\nThe leading-order approximation $P_m(k) \\approx 1 - \\exp(-mx)$ is accurate if the subsequent terms in the expansion are negligible. The first correction factor is $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{mx^2}{2}\\right)$. For this factor to be close to $1$, its exponent must be small in magnitude:\n$$\\frac{mx^2}{2} \\ll 1 \\implies \\frac{m}{2} \\left(\\frac{k}{N \\langle k \\rangle}\\right)^2 \\ll 1 \\implies mk^2 \\ll 2(N \\langle k \\rangle)^2$$\nThis inequality defines the regime of validity. The approximation is accurate for large $N$ and for values of $m$ and $k$ that do not grow too quickly.\nThe magnitude of the leading correction to the probability $P_m(k)$ itself can be found by expanding the correction factor $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{mx^2}{2}\\right) \\approx 1 - \\frac{mx^2}{2}$:\n$$P_m(k) \\approx 1 - \\exp(-mx)\\left(1 - \\frac{mx^2}{2}\\right) = \\left[1 - \\exp(-mx)\\right] + \\frac{mx^2}{2}\\exp(-mx)$$\nThe leading correction term is the second term, which has a magnitude of:\n$$\\frac{m}{2} \\left(\\frac{k}{N \\langle k \\rangle}\\right)^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mk}{N \\langle k \\rangle}\\right)$$\nThis correction term is of order $O\\left(\\frac{m k^2}{N^2}\\right)$.\nThe final answer requires the exact mean-field expression and its exponential approximation.",

            "problem": "Consider a large network generated by the configuration model with degree distribution $P(k)$ and finite mean degree $\\langle k \\rangle$. A disease spreads according to a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) process, where each contact (edge) transmits infection independently with probability (transmissibility) $T$. Before the epidemic begins, an acquaintance immunization strategy is applied: a proportion of randomly selected individuals each nominates one random neighbor to be immunized. In the limit of sparse sampling, this strategy induces a degree-dependent survival probability $s_k=\\exp(-\\nu k / \\langle k \\rangle)$ for a node of degree $k$, where $\\nu>0$ parameterizes the immunization effort.\n\nStarting from the following fundamental bases:\n- The configuration model produces locally tree-like networks in the large-size limit.\n- Early-time SIR dynamics on such networks can be approximated by a Galton–Watson branching process where the basic reproduction number equals the expected number of successful transmissions generated by following a typical infectious edge to a neighbor and then out along the neighbor’s remaining edges.\n- Degree-dependent node survival acts as a site occupation bias that reweights the neighbor-degree sampling of edges in proportion to $k P(k) s_k$, and transmissibility $T$ acts as independent bond occupation along edges.\n\nDerive, from first principles, the epidemic threshold condition for the existence of a global outbreak in terms of $T$, $P(k)$, and $s_k$.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in network epidemiology, self-contained, and well-posed. We can proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem asks for the epidemic threshold condition for an SIR process on a network where nodes have been immunized according to a degree-dependent survival probability $s_k$. The epidemic threshold corresponds to the point where the basic reproduction number, $R_*$, of the branching process approximation equals $1$. An epidemic can occur if $R_* > 1$.\n\nThe quantity $R_*$ represents the expected number of secondary infections produced by a single infected node that was itself infected by one of its neighbors. This is given by the product of the transmissibility $T$ and the mean excess degree of the network composed only of susceptible nodes.\n\nLet's denote the original degree distribution by $P(k)$. After the immunization process, a node of degree $k$ remains susceptible with probability $s_k$. We can think of this as a site percolation problem. The properties of the remaining (susceptible) network determine the epidemic dynamics.\n\nThe probability of reaching a susceptible neighbor of degree $k$ by following a random edge is proportional to the number of edges incident to such nodes, which is $k$, weighted by their original probability $P(k)$ and their survival probability $s_k$. Normalizing this, the probability distribution of the degree of a susceptible neighbor reached by a random edge is:\n$$\nq_s(k) = \\frac{k P(k) s_k}{\\sum_{k'} k' P(k') s_{k'}}\n$$\nAn infected node of degree $k$ has $k-1$ edges through which it can infect other neighbors. The expected number of secondary infections it will cause is given by $T$ multiplied by the expected number of susceptible neighbors connected through these $k-1$ edges.

            "solution": "The user wants to solve a three-part problem concerning the fragmentation of a network under a specific edge deletion protocol. The analysis will be conducted in the mean-field approximation suitable for large, sparse, uncorrelated networks.\n\n### Part 1: Edge Survival Probability $T_{k,k'}$\n\nLet us consider a specific edge connecting two nodes, say $u$ and $v$, with initial degrees $k$ and $k'$, respectively. The process consists of $S = \\alpha N$ independent steps, where $N$ is the number of nodes. In each step, a node is chosen uniformly at random, and one of its incident edges is deleted.\n\nThe problem states that we can neglect finite-size correlations and treat edge deletion events as independent. This is a crucial instruction, typical of mean-field analyses, which allows us to approximate the rate of edge deletion as being constant throughout the process, depending only on the initial degrees of the nodes.\n\nIn a single step of the process:\nThe probability of selecting node $u$ is $1/N$.\nThe probability of selecting node $v$ is $1/N$.\n\nIf node $u$ is selected, there are, at that moment, some number of edges incident to it. Under the mean-field approximation, we use its initial degree $k$. The probability of selecting the specific edge $(u,v)$ for deletion, given that $u$ was chosen, is $1/k$. Similarly, if $v$ is chosen, the probability of selecting edge $(u,v)$ is $1/k'$.\n\nSince the events of choosing node $u$ and node $v$ in a single step are mutually exclusive, the total probability $p_{\\text{del}}$ of deleting the edge $(u,v)$ in one step is the sum of the probabilities of these two scenarios:\n$$p_{\\text{del}} = P(\\text{delete via } u) + P(\\text{delete via } v) = \\frac{1}{N} \\cdot \\frac{1}{k} + \\frac{1}{N} \\cdot \\frac{1}{k'} = \\frac{1}{N} \\left( \\frac{1}{k} + \\frac{1}{k'} \\right)$$\nThe probability that this edge survives a single step is $1 - p_{\\text{del}}$. Since there are $S = \\alpha N$ independent steps, the total survival probability $T_{k,k'}$ is:\n$$T_{k,k'} = (1 - p_{\\text{del}})^{S} = \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{N} \\left( \\frac{1}{k} + \\frac{1}{k'} \\right) \\right)^{\\alpha N}$$\nIn the large-network limit where $N \\to \\infty$, we use the standard limit definition of the exponential function, $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (1 - x/n)^n = \\exp(-x)$:\n$$T_{k,k'} = \\exp\\left( -\\alpha \\left( \\frac{1}{k} + \\frac{1}{k'} \\right) \\right)$$\nThis is the survival probability of an edge whose endpoints have initial degrees $k$ and $k'$.\n\n### Part 2: Giant Connected Component (GCC) Criterion\n\nThe fragmentation of the network can be analyzed as a bond percolation problem on the original network structure. An edge between nodes of degree $k$ and $k'$ is considered 'occupied' with the probability $T_{k,k'}$ derived above.\n\nThe existence of a GCC is governed by the properties of a branching process that explores the network along occupied edges. The GCC exists if and only if the expected number of second-generation neighbors is greater than one. For a network with degree-degree correlations or degree-dependent bond occupation probabilities, this criterion is equivalent to the spectral radius of the appropriate transmission matrix being greater than $1$.\n\nLet's define the transmission matrix $M$. The element $M_{k'k}$ represents the expected number of neighbors of degree $k'$ reached via occupied edges from a node of degree $k$, which was itself reached by traversing an edge.\nA node of degree $k$ reached via an edge has $k-1$ other edges. For each of these $k-1$ edges, we determine the probability that it connects to a node of degree $k'$ and is occupied.\nFor an uncorrelated network, the probability that a neighbor has degree $k'$ is given by the excess degree distribution, $P(k' \\mid k) = \\frac{k' P(k')}{\\langle k \\rangle}$, where $\\langle k \\rangle = \\sum_j j P(j)$.\nThe probability that the edge connecting the degree-$k$ node to the degree-$k'$ node is occupied is $T_{k,k'}$.\nThus, the expected number of occupied edges from a degree-$k$ node to neighbors of degree $k'$ is $(k-1) P(k' \\mid k) T_{k,k'}$. This is the matrix element $M_{k'k}$:\n$$M_{k'k} = (k-1) \\frac{k' P(k')}{\\langle k \\rangle} T_{k,k'} = (k-1) \\frac{k' P(k')}{\\langle k \\rangle} \\exp\\left( -\\alpha \\left( \\frac{1}{k} + \\frac{1}{k'} \\right) \\right)$$\nThe GCC criterion is that the spectral radius $\\rho(M)$ of this non-negative matrix $M$ must be greater than $1$.\nTo find $\\rho(M)$, we solve the eigenvalue equation $\\lambda \\mathbf{x} = M \\mathbf{x}$, which in component form is $\\lambda x_{k'} = \\sum_k M_{k'k} x_k$.\n$$ \\lambda x_{k'} = \\sum_k (k-1) \\frac{k' P(k')}{\\langle k \\rangle} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha}{k}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha}{k'}\\right) x_k $$\n$$ \\lambda x_{k'} = \\left( \\frac{k' P(k')}{\\langle k \\rangle} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha}{k'}\\right) \\right) \\left( \\sum_k (k-1) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha}{k}\\right) x_k \\right) $$\nThis shows that the matrix $M$ is of rank one. The expression in the second parenthesis is a scalar constant. This implies that the eigenvector $\\mathbf{x}$ must be proportional to the vector $\\mathbf{v}$ with components $v_{k'} = \\frac{k' P(k')}{\\langle k \\rangle} \\exp(-\\frac{\\alpha}{k'})$.\nLet $x_k = c v_k$ for some constant $c$. Substituting this into the eigenvalue equation, we can find the sole non-zero eigenvalue $\\lambda$, which is the spectral radius $\\rho(M)$.\n$$ \\lambda (c v_{k'}) = v_{k'} \\left( \\sum_k (k-1) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha}{k}\\right) (c v_k) \\right) $$\nDividing by $c v_{k'}$ (assuming $c \\neq 0, v_{k'} \\neq 0$), we get:\n$$ \\lambda = \\sum_k (k-1) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha}{k}\\right) v_k = \\sum_k (k-1) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha}{k}\\right) \\frac{k P(k)}{\\langle k \\rangle} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha}{k}\\right) $$\n$$ \\rho(M) = \\lambda = \\sum_k \\frac{k(k-1)P(k)}{\\langle k \\rangle} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\alpha}{k}\\right) $$\nThe explicit GCC criterion is therefore:\n$$ \\sum_k \\frac{k(k-1)P(k)}{\\langle k \\rangle} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\alpha}{k}\\right) > 1 $$\n\n### Part 3: Critical Intensity $\\alpha_c$ for a Random $K$-regular Graph\n\nFor a random $K$-regular graph with $K \\ge 3$, the degree of every node is exactly $K$. The degree distribution is a Dirac delta function: $P(k) = \\mathbf{1}\\{k=K\\}$, which can be written using the Kronecker delta as $P(k) = \\delta_{kK}$.\nFor this distribution, the average degree is $\\langle k \\rangle = \\sum_k k P(k) = K \\cdot 1 = K$.\n\nThe GCC disappears at the critical point $\\alpha_c$, where the criterion becomes an equality:\n$$ \\sum_k \\frac{k(k-1)P(k)}{\\langle k \\rangle} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\alpha_c}{k}\\right) = 1 $$\nSubstituting $P(k) = \\delta_{kK}$ and $\\langle k \\rangle = K$, the sum collapses to a single term evaluated at $k=K$:\n$$ \\frac{K(K-1)P(K)}{K} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\alpha_c}{K}\\right) = 1 $$\nSince $P(K)=1$, this simplifies to:\n$$ (K-1) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\alpha_c}{K}\\right) = 1 $$\nWe now solve for the critical intensity $\\alpha_c$. First, isolate the exponential term:\n$$ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\alpha_c}{K}\\right) = \\frac{1}{K-1} $$\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ -\\frac{2\\alpha_c}{K} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{K-1}\\right) = -\\ln(K-1) $$\nMultiply by $-1$ and solve for $\\alpha_c$:\n$$ \\frac{2\\alpha_c}{K} = \\ln(K-1) $$\n$$ \\alpha_c = \\frac{K}{2} \\ln(K-1) $$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the critical query intensity at which the GCC disappears.",
