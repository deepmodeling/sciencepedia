This foundational exercise guides you through the first-principles derivation of why this works.

            "problem": "Consider a large, undirected, simple network with $N$ nodes, degree distribution $P(k)$, and mean degree $\\langle k \\rangle$. In the acquaintance immunization protocol, a single immunization query proceeds as follows: first select a node uniformly at random from the $N$ nodes, then select one of its neighbors uniformly at random, and immunize that neighbor. Assume queries are conducted independently with replacement, meaning that the network and the sampling mechanism are unaffected by prior immunizations and each query is identically distributed.\n\nUnder the configuration model assumption of negligible degree-degree correlations, derive from first principles an exact expression (in the mean-field sense) for the probability $P_{m}(k)$ that a node of degree $k$ is immunized at least once after $m$ independent queries with replacement. Then obtain a leading-order exponential approximation to $P_{m}(k)$ appropriate for sparse sampling in large networks, and identify the regime in terms of $N$, $k$, and $m$ under which this approximation is accurate, including the magnitude of the leading correction.\n\nYour final answer must consist of the exact mean-field expression and its exponential approximation written as closed-form analytic expressions. No numerical evaluation is required.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the probability $P_{m}(k)$ that a node of degree $k$ is immunized at least once after $m$ independent queries using the acquaintance immunization protocol, along with a leading-order approximation and its regime of validity. The derivation will be performed under the mean-field assumption of a configuration model network with negligible degree-degree correlations.\n\nFirst, we derive the probability, which we denote as $q(k)$, that a specific node of degree $k$ is selected for immunization in a single query. Let the target node be $V$, with degree $\\text{deg}(V) = k$. The acquaintance immunization protocol consists of two steps:\n$1$. A node, let's call it $U$, is selected uniformly at random from the $N$ nodes in the network. The probability of selecting any specific node $U$ is $1/N$.\n$2$. A neighbor of $U$ is selected uniformly at random and is immunized.\n\nFor our target node $V$ to be immunized, the node $U$ selected in step $1$ must be one of its neighbors. Let the set of neighbors of $V$ be $\\mathcal{N}(V)$, where $|\\mathcal{N}(V)|=k$. If a specific neighbor $U_i \\in \\mathcal{N}(V)$ is chosen in step $1$, its degree is $\\text{deg}(U_i)$. In step $2$, for $V$ to be immunized, it must be chosen from the $\\text{deg}(U_i)$ neighbors of $U_i$. The probability of this is $1/\\text{deg}(U_i)$.\n\nThe probability of $V$ being immunized via a specific neighbor $U_i$ is the product of the probabilities of these two independent events: $P(\\text{select } U_i \\text{ then } V) = P(\\text{select } U_i) \\times P(\\text{select } V | U_i \\text{ was chosen}) = \\frac{1}{N} \\times \\frac{1}{\\text{deg}(U_i)}$.\n\nThe total probability $q_V$ that node $V$ is immunized in a single query is the sum of these probabilities over all its neighbors, as these are mutually exclusive events (only one node $U$ is chosen in step $1$):\n$$q_V = \\sum_{U_i \\in \\mathcal{N}(V)} \\frac{1}{N \\cdot \\text{deg}(U_i)} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{1}{\\text{deg}(U_i)}$$\nThis probability depends on the degrees of the specific neighbors of node $V$. The problem asks for $P_m(k)$, which refers to a generic node of degree $k$. We therefore need to compute the expected probability $q(k)$ by averaging $q_V$ over all nodes $V$ of degree $k$.\n$$q(k) = \\left\\langle q_V \\right\\rangle_{\\text{deg}(V)=k} = \\frac{1}{N} \\left\\langle \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{1}{\\text{deg}(U_i)} \\right\\rangle_{\\text{deg}(V)=k}$$\nUnder the configuration model assumption of no degree-degree correlations, the degree of a neighbor of a node is independent of the node's own degree. The probability distribution of a neighbor's degree, $P_{nn}(k')$, is not the overall degree distribution $P(k')$ but is skewed towards higher-degree nodes. This is because a a node of degree $k'$ has $k'$ edges, making it $k'$ times more likely to be a neighbor than a node of degree $1$. The normalized distribution for a neighbor's degree is $P_{nn}(k') = \\frac{k' P(k')}{\\sum_{j} j P(j)} = \\frac{k' P(k')}{\\langle k \\rangle}$.\n\nWe can now compute the expected value of the reciprocal of a neighbor's degree:\n$$\\left\\langle \\frac{1}{\\text{deg}(\\text{neighbor})} \\right\\rangle = \\sum_{k'=1}^{N-1} \\frac{1}{k'} P_{nn}(k') = \\sum_{k'=1}^{N-1} \\frac{1}{k'} \\frac{k' P(k')}{\\langle k \\rangle} = \\frac{1}{\\langle k \\rangle} \\sum_{k'=1}^{N-1} P(k') = \\frac{1}{\\langle k \\rangle}$$\nsince $\\sum P(k') = 1$.\nApplying this mean-field result, the expected value of the sum becomes a sum of expectations:\n$$q(k) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{\\text{deg}(U_i)} \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{1}{\\langle k \\rangle} = \\frac{k}{N \\langle k \\rangle}$$\nThis is the mean-field probability that a node of degree $k$ is immunized in a single query. Note that this probability is proportional to the node's degree $k$, which is the central advantage of the acquaintance immunization strategy.\n\nNow we find $P_m(k)$, the probability of being immunized at least once in $m$ independent queries. It is more convenient to first calculate the probability of *not* being immunized. The probability of not being immunized in one query is $1 - q(k)$. Since all $m$ queries are independent and conducted with replacement, the probability of not being immunized in any of the $m$ queries is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$P(\\text{not immunized in } m \\text{ queries}) = (1 - q(k))^m = \\left(1 - \\frac{k}{N \\langle k \\rangle}\\right)^m$$\nThe probability $P_m(k)$ of being immunized at least once is the complement of this event:\n$$P_m(k) = 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{k}{N \\langle k \\rangle}\\right)^m$$\nThis is the first required result: the exact expression for $P_m(k)$ in the mean-field sense.\n\nNext, we derive the leading-order exponential approximation. This approximation is valid under the condition of \"sparse sampling in large networks,\" which implies that the probability of immunization in a single query is very small. Mathematically, this corresponds to the regime where $q(k) = \\frac{k}{N \\langle k \\rangle} \\ll 1$. This condition is satisfied for large networks ($N \\to \\infty$) as long as $k$ and $\\langle k \\rangle$ are not of order $N$.\nWe use the well-known limit for the exponential function, $(1-x)^m \\approx \\exp(-mx)$, which is the leading-order term in the expansion of $\\exp(m \\ln(1-x))$.\nSetting $x = q(k) = \\frac{k}{N \\langle k \\rangle}$, we get:\n$$P_m(k) = 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{k}{N \\langle k \\rangle}\\right)^m \\approx 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mk}{N \\langle k \\rangle}\\right)$$\nThis is the second required result: the leading-order exponential approximation.\n\nFinally, we analyze the regime of validity and the leading correction. The approximation is derived from the Taylor series of the natural logarithm: $\\ln(1-x) = -x - \\frac{x^2}{2} - \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\dots$.\nThen, $(1-x)^m = \\exp(m\\ln(1-x)) = \\exp\\left(m\\left(-x - \\frac{x^2}{2} - O(x^3)\\right)\\right) = \\exp(-mx) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mx^2}{2}\\right) \\exp\\left(-O(mx^3)\\right)$.\nThe leading-order approximation $P_m(k) \\approx 1 - \\exp(-mx)$ is accurate if the subsequent terms in the expansion are negligible. The first correction factor is $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{mx^2}{2}\\right)$. For this factor to be close to $1$, its exponent must be small in magnitude:\n$$\\frac{mx^2}{2} \\ll 1 \\implies \\frac{m}{2} \\left(\\frac{k}{N \\langle k \\rangle}\\right)^2 \\ll 1 \\implies mk^2 \\ll 2(N \\langle k \\rangle)^2$$\nThis inequality defines the regime of validity. The approximation is accurate for large $N$ and for values of $m$ and $k$ that do not grow too quickly.\nThe magnitude of the leading correction to the probability $P_m(k)$ itself can be found by expanding the correction factor $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{mx^2}{2}\\right) \\approx 1 - \\frac{mx^2}{2}$:\n$$P_m(k) \\approx 1 - \\exp(-mx)\\left(1 - \\frac{mx^2}{2}\\right) = \\left[1 - \\exp(-mx)\\right] + \\frac{mx^2}{2}\\exp(-mx)$$\nThe leading correction term is the second term, which has a magnitude of:\n$$\\frac{m}{2} \\left(\\frac{k}{N \\langle k \\rangle}\\right)^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mk}{N \\langle k \\rangle}\\right)$$\nThis correction term is of order $O\\left(\\frac{m k^2}{N^2}\\right)$.\nThe final answer requires the exact mean-field expression and its exponential approximation.",

            "problem": "Consider a large network generated by the configuration model with degree distribution $P(k)$ and finite mean degree $\\langle k \\rangle$. A disease spreads according to a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) process, where each contact (edge) transmits infection independently with probability (transmissibility) $T$. Before the epidemic begins, an acquaintance immunization strategy is applied: a proportion of randomly selected individuals each nominates one random neighbor to be immunized. In the limit of sparse sampling, this strategy induces a degree-dependent survival probability $s_k=\\exp\\!\\left(-\\nu k / \\langle k \\rangle\\right)$ for a node of degree $k$, where $\\nu>0$ parameterizes the immunization effort.\n\nStarting from the following fundamental bases:\n- The configuration model produces locally tree-like networks in the large-size limit.\n- Early-time SIR dynamics on such networks can be approximated by a Galton–Watson branching process where the basic reproduction number equals the expected number of successful transmissions generated by following a typical infectious edge to a neighbor and then out along the neighbor’s remaining edges.\n- Degree-dependent node survival acts as a site occupation bias that reweights the neighbor-degree sampling of edges in proportion to $k P(k) s_k$, and transmissibility $T$ acts as independent bond occupation along edges.\n\nDerive, from first principles, the epidemic threshold condition for the existence of a global outbreak in terms of $T$, $P(k)$, and $s_k$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the epidemic threshold condition for an SIR process on a network where nodes have been immunized according to a degree-dependent survival probability $s_k$. The epidemic threshold corresponds to the point where the basic reproduction number, $R_*$, of the branching process approximation equals $1$. An epidemic can occur if $R_* > 1$.\n\nThe quantity $R_*$ represents the expected number of secondary infections produced by a single infected node that was itself infected by one of its neighbors. This is given by the product of the transmissibility $T$ and the mean excess degree of the network composed only of susceptible nodes.\n\nLet's denote the original degree distribution by $P(k)$. After the immunization process, a node of degree $k$ remains susceptible with probability $s_k$. We can think of this as a site percolation problem. The properties of the remaining (susceptible) network determine the epidemic dynamics.\n\nThe probability of reaching a susceptible neighbor of degree $k$ by following a random edge is proportional to the number of edges incident to such nodes, which is $k$, weighted by their original probability $P(k)$ and their survival probability $s_k$.

In the absence of immunization and inter-block edges, the early-time dynamics are well approximated by a single-type Galton-Watson branching process in each block with mean offspring number $r_b = T \\kappa_b$, where $\\kappa_b = \\frac{\\langle k^{2}\\rangle_b - \\langle k\\rangle_b}{\\langle k\\rangle_b}$ is the mean excess degree in block $b$.
