Calculation of $\\beta_1$**\n\nThe first Betti number is $\\beta_1 = \\dim(H_1) = \\dim(\\ker \\partial_1) - \\dim(\\text{im} \\partial_2)$.\n\nFirst, we find $\\dim(\\text{im} \\partial_2)$. The image of $\\partial_2$ is the space spanned by the columns of the matrix $[\\partial_2]$.\n$$[\\partial_2] = (1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)^T$$\nSince this is a non-zero vector, its rank is $1$. Thus, $\\dim(\\text{im} \\partial_2) = 1$. The image itself is spanned by the 1-chain $e_1+e_2+e_3$.\n\nNext, we find $\\dim(\\ker \\partial_1)$. By the rank-nullity theorem, $\\dim(\\ker \\partial_1) = \\dim(C_1) - \\text{rank}([\\partial_1])$. We are given $\\dim(C_1) = 6$. We need to compute the rank of $[\\partial_1]$.

There are $4$ non-zero rows, so $\\text{rank}([\\partial_1]) = 4$.\nNow we can compute the nullity: $\\dim(\\ker \\partial_1) = 6 - 4 = 2$.\nFinally, we compute $\\beta_1$:\n$$\\beta_1 = \\dim(\\ker \\partial_1) - \\dim(\\text{im} \\partial_2) = 2 - 1 = 1$$\n\nTo find a representative cycle for the non-trivial class in $H_1$, we find a basis for $\\ker \\partial_1$. From the row echelon form of $[\\partial_1]$, the pivot variables correspond to columns $1, 2, 4, 5$. The free variables correspond to columns $3$ and $6$. Let the coordinates of a vector in $C_1$ be $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6)$.\nThe system of equations for the kernel is:\n$x_1 + x_3 = 0 \\implies x_1 = x_3$\n$x_2 + x_3 = 0 \\implies x_2 = x_3$\n$x_4 + x_6 = 0 \\implies x_4 = x_6$\n$x_5 + x_6 = 0 \\implies x_5 = x_6$\nSetting free variable $x_3=1, x_6=0$ gives the vector $(1,1,1,0,0,0)^T$. This corresponds to the 1-cycle $z_1 = e_1+e_2+e_3$.\nSetting free variable $x_3=0, x_6=1$ gives the vector $(0,0,0,1,1,1)^T$. This corresponds to the 1-cycle $z_2 = e_4+e_5+e_6$.\nThus, a basis for $\\ker \\partial_1$ is $\\{z_1, z_2\\}$.\nThe homology group $H_1$ is the quotient of $\\ker \\partial_1$ by $\\text{im} \\partial_2$. We found that $\\text{im} \\partial_2$ is spanned by $e_1+e_2+e_3$, which is precisely our basis vector $z_1$. Therefore, in the quotient group, the class $[z_1]$ is the zero element. The group $H_1$ is generated by the class of the other basis vector, $[z_2]$.\nA representative cycle for the non-trivial class in $H_1$ is $z_2 = e_4+e_5+e_6$.\n\n**2. Calculation of $\\beta_0$**\n\nThe zeroth Betti number is $\\beta_0 = \\dim(H_0) = \\dim(\\ker \\partial_0) - \\dim(\\text{im} \\partial_1)$.\n\nThe boundary operator $\\partial_0: C_0 \\to 0$ maps everything to zero. Thus, $\\ker \\partial_0 = C_0$.\nWe are given that $\\dim(C_0)=5$.\nFrom our previous calculation, we found $\\text{rank}([\\partial_1]) = 4$. This is precisely $\\dim(\\text{im} \\partial_1)$.\nSo, we can compute $\\beta_0$:\n$$\\beta_0 = \\dim(C_0) - \\text{rank}([\\partial_1]) = 5 - 4 = 1$$\nA value of $\\beta_0=1$ indicates that the simplicial complex has one connected component.\n\nThe homology group $H_0 = C_0 / \\text{im}(\\partial_1)$ is generated by any 0-cycle that is not a boundary. The elements of $\\text{im}(\\partial_1)$ are of the form $\\partial_1(e_i) = v_j - v_k$ (or $v_j+v_k$ in $\\mathbb{F}_2$). These relations imply that in $H_0$, the homology classes of any two vertices connected by an edge are equal. For instance, $\\partial_1(e_1) = v_1+v_2$ being in $\\text{im}(\\partial_1)$ means $[v_1+v_2]=0$ in $H_0$, which implies $[v_1]=[v_2]$. Since the complex is connected, all vertices are homologous to each other.\nThe group $H_0$ is generated by the homology class of any single vertex, for example, $[v_1]$. Thus, a representative 0-cycle for the non-trivial class in $H_0$ is $v_1$.\n\n**3. Final Calculation**\n\nWe are asked to compute $S = \\beta_0 + 3\\beta_1$.\nUsing our computed values:\n$\\beta_0 = 1$\n$\\beta_1 = 1$\n$$S = 1 + 3(1) = 4$$\n\nThe representative cycles are $v_1$ for the non-trivial class in $H_0$ and $e_4+e_5+e_6$ for the non-trivial class in $H_1$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the birth and death scales for the one-dimensional homology class generated by the Vietoris-Rips filtration of a three-point metric space.\n\nThe metric space is $X = \\{x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}\\} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, forming the vertices of an equilateral triangle with side length $1$. The pairwise distances are $d(x_{i}, x_{j}) = 1$ for all distinct $i, j \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, and $d(x_{i}, x_{i}) = 0$. The homology is computed with coefficients in the field $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$.\n\nThe Vietoris-Rips complex, $\\mathrm{VR}(X,\\epsilon)$, is defined for a scale parameter $\\epsilon \\ge 0$. A finite subset of $X$, say $\\sigma \\subseteq X$, is a simplex in $\\mathrm{VR}(X,\\epsilon)$ if and only if for every pair of points $u, v \\in \\sigma$, the distance $d(u, v) \\le \\epsilon$. This is equivalent to requiring the diameter of the point set $\\sigma$ to be at most $\\epsilon$.\n\nWe must first analyze the structure of the simplicial complex $\\mathrm{VR}(X,\\epsilon)$ as $\\epsilon$ increases. The set of all pairwise distances between points in $X$ is $\\{0, 1\\}$. Therefore, the combinatorial structure of the complex $\\mathrm{VR}(X,\\epsilon)$ only changes at the critical value $\\epsilon = 1$.\n\nCase 1: $\\epsilon \\in [0, 1)$\nFor a simplex $\\sigma$ to be in $\\mathrm{VR}(X,\\epsilon)$, its diameter must be less than $1$.\n- $0$-simplices: The sets $\\{x_{1}\\}$, $\\{x_{2}\\}$, and $\\{x_{3}\\}$ have diameter $0$. Since $0  1$, these three $0$-simplices are present in $\\mathrm{VR}(X,\\epsilon)$ for all $\\epsilon \\ge 0$.\n- $1$-simplices: A $1$-simplex is a pair of points $\\{x_{i}, x_{j}\\}$ with $i \\neq j$. The diameter is $d(x_{i}, x_{j}) = 1$. Since we require the diameter to be strictly less than $1$ in this range of $\\epsilon$, no $1$-simplices are present.\n- Higher-dimensional simplices: Since no $1$-simplices exist, no simplices of dimension $2$ or higher can exist.\n\nThus, for $\\epsilon \\in [0, 1)$, the complex $\\mathrm{VR}(X,\\epsilon)$ consists of three disconnected vertices. Let's denote this complex by $K_{\\epsilon}$. The chain groups are $C_{0}(K_{\\epsilon}) = \\mathrm{span}_{\\mathbb{Z}_{2}}\\{x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}\\}$ and $C_{k}(K_{\\epsilon}) = \\{0\\}$ for $k \\ge 1$. The group of $1$-cycles, $Z_{1}(K_{\\epsilon}) = \\ker(\\partial_{1})$, is trivial because $C_{1}(K_{\\epsilon}) = \\{0\\}$. Consequently, the first homology group $H_{1}(K_{\\epsilon}) = Z_{1}(K_{\\epsilon}) / B_{1}(K_{\\epsilon}) = \\{0\\} / \\{0\\} = \\{0\\}$. No one-dimensional homology class exists in this interval.\n\nCase 2: $\\epsilon \\ge 1$\nAt $\\epsilon=1$, the structure of the complex changes.\n- $1$-simplices: For any pair $\\{x_{i}, x_{j}\\}$ with $i \\neq j$, the diameter is $d(x_{i}, x_{j}) = 1$. The condition is $1 \\le \\epsilon$. This is satisfied for $\\epsilon=1$. Therefore, the three $1$-simplices $e_{12}=\\{x_{1}, x_{2}\\}$, $e_{13}=\\{x_{1}, x_{3}\\}$, and $e_{23}=\\{x_{2}, x_{3}\\}$ are all added to the complex simultaneously at $\\epsilon = 1$.\n- $2$-simplex: For the set $\\sigma = \\{x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}\\}$, the diameter is $\\max\\{d(x_{1}, x_{2}), d(x_{1}, x_{3}), d(x_{2}, x_{3})\\} = \\max\\{1, 1, 1\\} = 1$. The condition is $1 \\le \\epsilon$, which is satisfied at $\\epsilon=1$. Thus, the $2$-simplex $f_{123}=\\{x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}\\}$ is also added at $\\epsilon=1$.\n\nFor any $\\epsilon \\ge 1$, $\\mathrm{VR}(X,\\epsilon)$ is the complete $2$-simplex, which is a filled triangle.\n\nNow we can determine the birth and death of the one-dimensional homology class.\nThe birth of a homology class occurs at the filtration value where a cycle is formed that is not a boundary. At $\\epsilon=1$, the three $1$-simplices are added, allowing the formation of the $1$-chain $c = e_{12} + e_{13} + e_{23}$. To verify if $c$ is a cycle, we compute its boundary using the boundary operator $\\partial_{1}$ with $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ coefficients:\n$$ \\partial_{1}(c) = \\partial_{1}(e_{12} + e_{13} + e_{23}) = \\partial_{1}(\\{x_{1},x_{2}\\}) + \\partial_{1}(\\{x_{1},x_{3}\\}) + \\partial_{1}(\\{x_{2},x_{3}\\}) $$\n$$ = (x_{1} + x_{2}) + (x_{1} + x_{3}) + (x_{2} + x_{3}) = 2x_{1} + 2x_{2} + 2x_{3} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2} $$\nSince $\\partial_{1}(c)=0$, $c$ is a $1$-cycle. This cycle appears for the first time at $\\epsilon=1$, because the edges that constitute it all appear at $\\epsilon=1$. The birth scale of the homology class $[c]$ is the maximum filtration value of the simplices in its minimal representation, which is $\\max(\\text{filt}(e_{12}), \\text{filt}(e_{13}), \\text{filt}(e_{23}))=\\max(1,1,1)=1$. Thus, $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{birth}} = 1$.\n\nThe death of a homology class occurs when its representative cycle becomes a boundary of a higher-dimensional chain. A cycle dies when it is \"filled in\". We need to find the smallest $\\epsilon$ at which $c$ becomes an element of the boundary group $B_{1}(\\mathrm{VR}(X,\\epsilon)) = \\mathrm{im}(\\partial_{2})$.\nAs established, the $2$-simplex $f_{123}=\\{x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}\\}$ also enters the complex at $\\epsilon=1$. Let's compute its boundary using the operator $\\partial_{2}: C_{2} \\to C_{1}$:\n$$ \\partial_{2}(f_{123}) = \\partial_{2}(\\{x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}\\}) = \\{x_{2}, x_{3}\\} + \\{x_{1}, x_{3}\\} + \\{x_{1}, x_{2}\\} = e_{23} + e_{13} + e_{12} $$\nThe boundary of the $2$-simplex $f_{123}$ is precisely the cycle $c$. This means that at the exact same moment the cycle $c$ is formed ($\\epsilon=1$), it is immediately filled by the $2$-simplex $f_{123}$ and becomes a boundary.\nIn the context of persistent homology, the pairing is between the simplex that creates the cycle (the last edge added to form it) and the simplex that kills it (the face that fills it). The birth time is the filtration value of the creating simplex, and the death time is the filtration value of the killing simplex.\nThe cycle $c$ is born at $\\epsilon=1$. The simplex that kills it is $f_{123}$, whose filtration value is $1$. Therefore, the death scale is $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{death}} = 1$.\n\nThe unique one-dimensional homology class produced by this filtration is born at $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{birth}} = 1$ and dies at $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{death}} = 1$. The lifetime of this feature, $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{death}} - \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{birth}}$, is $0$.",

This is the clique complex of the graph $G_{\\epsilon}$ with vertex set $X$ and an edge between any two points $x, y$ if $d(x,y) \\leq \\epsilon$. The critical values of $\\epsilon$ are the distances $1$ and $\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n- For $\\epsilon \\in [0, 1)$: The condition $d(x,y) \\leq \\epsilon$ is not met for any pair of distinct points. The graph $G_{\\epsilon}$ consists of $4$ isolated vertices. The complex $\\mathrm{VR}(X,\\epsilon)$ is the $0$-dimensional complex consisting of four points. Thus, its first homology group is trivial: $H_{1}(\\mathrm{VR}(X,\\epsilon);\\mathbb{Z}_{2}) \\cong 0$.\n\n- For $\\epsilon \\in [1, \\sqrt{2})$: The four edges corresponding to the sides of the square are added, since their length is $1$. The distances along the diagonals are $\\sqrt{2}$, so no diagonal edges are present. The graph $G_{\\epsilon}$ is a cycle graph on $4$ vertices. The maximal cliques in this graph are the four edges. Thus, $\\mathrm{VR}(X,\\epsilon)$ is a hollow square, which is homeomorphic to a circle $S^{1}$. The first homology group is non-trivial: $H_{1}(\\mathrm{VR}(X,\\epsilon);\\mathbb{Z}_{2}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{2}$. The generator of this group corresponds to the cycle $P_1-P_2-P_3-P_4-P_1$.\n\n- For $\\epsilon \\in [\\sqrt{2}, \\infty)$: The two diagonal edges are added to the graph, as their length $\\sqrt{2}$ is now less than or equal to $\\epsilon$. The graph $G_{\\epsilon}$ becomes the complete graph $K_{4}$. The clique complex of $K_{4}$ is the $3$-simplex $\\Delta^{3}$, which consists of the $4$ vertices, $6$ edges, $4$ triangular faces, and $1$ tetrahedron. The $3$-simplex is contractible, so all its homology groups are trivial. Thus, $H_{1}(\\mathrm{VR}(X,\\epsilon);\\mathbb{Z}_{2}) \\cong 0$.\n\nSummary for $\\mathrm{VR}(X,\\epsilon)$:\n- $H_{1}(\\mathrm{VR}(X,\\epsilon);\\mathbb{Z}_{2}) \\cong 0$ for $\\epsilon \\in [0, 1) \\cup [\\sqrt{2}, \\infty)$.\n- $H_{1}(\\mathrm{VR}(X,\\epsilon);\\mathbb{Z}_{2}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ for $\\epsilon \\in [1, \\sqrt{2})$.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Čech Complex $\\mathrm{Cech}(X,\\epsilon)$**\n\nThe Čech complex $\\mathrm{Cech}(X,\\epsilon)$ is the nerve of the family of closed balls $\\{B(x, \\epsilon) : x \\in X\\}$. A $k$-simplex $\\{x_0, \\dots, x_k\\}$ exists if the intersection of the corresponding balls is non-empty: $\\bigcap_{i=0}^{k} B(x_i, \\epsilon) \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\n- **$1$-simplices (edges):** An edge $\\{x,y\\}$ is in $\\mathrm{Cech}(X,\\epsilon)$ if $B(x,\\epsilon) \\cap B(y,\\epsilon) \\neq \\emptyset$. This is true if and only if $d(x,y) \\leq 2\\epsilon$, or $\\epsilon \\geq d(x,y)/2$.\n  - The four side edges (length $1$) appear when $\\epsilon \\geq 1/2$.\n  - The two diagonal edges (length $\\sqrt{2}$) appear when $\\epsilon \\geq \\sqrt{2}/2$.\n\n- **$2$-simplices (triangles):** A triangle $\\{x,y,z\\}$ is in $\\mathrm{Cech}(X,\\epsilon)$ if $B(x,\\epsilon) \\cap B(y,\\epsilon) \\cap B(z,\\epsilon) \\neq \\emptyset$. This is equivalent to $\\epsilon$ being greater than or equal to the circumradius of the triangle $\\triangle xyz$. All $4$ possible triangles that can be formed from the vertices of the square (e.g., $\\{P_1,P_2,P_3\\}$) are right-angled isosceles triangles with side lengths $1, 1, \\sqrt{2}$. The circumradius of such a triangle is half the length of its hypotenuse, which is $\\sqrt{2}/2$. Therefore, all four $2$-simplices appear simultaneously at $\\epsilon = \\sqrt{2}/2$.\n\n- **$3$-simplex (tetrahedron):** The simplex $\\{P_1,P_2,P_3,P_4\\}$ exists if $\\bigcap_{i=1}^{4} B(P_i, \\epsilon) \\neq \\emptyset$. This requires a point $p$ such that $d(p, P_i) \\leq \\epsilon$ for all $i$. This is equivalent to $\\epsilon$ being greater than or equal to the circumradius of the set of points $X$. The circumcenter of the square is its geometric center $(1/2, 1/2)$. The distance from the center to any vertex is $\\sqrt{(1/2)^2 + (1/2)^2} = \\sqrt{1/2} = \\sqrt{2}/2$. Thus, the $3$-simplex appears at $\\epsilon = \\sqrt{2}/2$.\n\nLet's build the filtration for $\\mathrm{Cech}(X,\\epsilon)$:\n\n- For $\\epsilon \\in [0, 1/2)$: No pairs of balls intersect. The complex consists of $4$ isolated vertices. $H_{1}(\\mathrm{Cech}(X,\\epsilon);\\mathbb{Z}_{2}) \\cong 0$.\n\n- For $\\epsilon \\in [1/2, \\sqrt{2}/2)$: The four balls corresponding to adjacent vertices intersect, creating the four side-edges of the square. No higher-dimensional simplices are formed yet. The complex is a hollow square, homeomorphic to $S^{1}$. Thus, $H_{1}(\\mathrm{Cech}(X,\\epsilon);\\mathbb{Z}_{2}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{2}$.\n\n- For $\\epsilon \\in [\\sqrt{2}/2, \\infty)$: At $\\epsilon = \\sqrt{2}/2$, the diagonal edges, all four $2$-simplices (faces), and the single $3$-simplex (tetrahedron) all appear simultaneously. The complex becomes the full $3$-simplex $\\Delta^{3}$, which is contractible. Therefore, $H_{1}(\\mathrm{Cech}(X,\\epsilon);\\mathbb{Z}_{2}) \\cong 0$.\n\nSummary for $\\mathrm{Cech}(X,\\epsilon)$:\n- $H_{1}(\\mathrm{Cech}(X,\\epsilon);\\mathbb{Z}_{2}) \\cong 0$ for $\\epsilon \\in [0, 1/2) \\cup [\\sqrt{2}/2, \\infty)$.\n- $H_1(\\mathrm{Cech}(X,\\epsilon);\\mathbb{Z}_{2}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ for $\\epsilon \\in [1/2, \\sqrt{2}/2)$.\n\n**3. Comparison and Measure Calculation**\n\nWe need to find the set of $\\epsilon$ values for which $H_{1}(\\mathrm{Cech}(X,\\epsilon);\\mathbb{Z}_{2}) \\not\\cong H_{1}(\\mathrm{VR}(X,\\epsilon);\\mathbb{Z}_{2})$. Let's compare the homology groups on the intervals defined by the critical values $\\{1/2, \\sqrt{2}/2, 1, \\sqrt{2}\\}$.\n\n- Interval $\\epsilon \\in [0, 1/2)$:\n  $H_1^{\\mathrm{Cech}} \\cong 0$, $H_1^{\\mathrm{VR}} \\cong 0$. Isomorphic.\n- Interval $\\epsilon \\in [1/2, \\sqrt{2}/2)$:\n  $H_1^{\\mathrm{Cech}} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{2}$, $H_1^{\\mathrm{VR}} \\cong 0$. Not isomorphic.\n- Interval $\\epsilon \\in [\\sqrt{2}/2, 1)$:\n  $H_1^{\\mathrm{Cech}} \\cong 0$, $H_1^{\\mathrm{VR}} \\cong 0$. Isomorphic.\n- Interval $\\epsilon \\in [1, \\sqrt{2})$:\n  $H_1^{\\mathrm{Cech}} \\cong 0$, $H_1^{\\mathrm{VR}} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{2}$. Not isomorphic.\n- Interval $\\epsilon \\in [\\sqrt{2}, \\infty)$:\n  $H_1^{\\mathrm{Cech}} \\cong 0$, $H_1^{\\mathrm{VR}} \\cong 0$. Isomorphic.\n\nThe subset of scales $\\epsilon$ at which the first homology groups are not isomorphic is the union of two disjoint intervals: $[1/2, \\sqrt{2}/2) \\cup [1, \\sqrt{2})$. The total Lebesgue measure (length) of this subset is the sum of the lengths of these intervals.\n\nMeasure = $(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}) + (\\sqrt{2} - 1)$\nMeasure = $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{2} - \\frac{2}{2}$\nMeasure = $\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2} - \\frac{3}{2}$\nMeasure = $\\frac{3}{2}(\\sqrt{2} - 1)$",
