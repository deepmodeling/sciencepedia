            "problem": "Consider the cycle graph $C_5$ with vertex set $V=\\{v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4,v_5\\}$ and edge set $E=\\{\\{v_1,v_2\\},\\{v_2,v_3\\},\\{v_3,v_4\\},\\{v_4,v_5\\},\\{v_5,v_1\\}\\}$.

No rounding is required, and no units are involved. The final answer must be given as a single number.",
            "solution": "We begin from the core definitions. A graph $G=(V,E)$ consists of a vertex set $V$ and an edge set $E\\subseteq \\binom{V}{2}$. A clique (complete subgraph) of size $k$ is a set of $k$ vertices in which every pair of vertices is joined by an edge; equivalently, a $k$-clique is a complete graph $K_k$ embedded as an induced subgraph. The clique complex (also called the flag complex) of a graph $G$ is the abstract simplicial complex whose $k$-simplices are exactly the $(k+1)$-cliques of $G$. The dimension of a simplex on $m$ vertices is $m-1$, and the dimension of a simplicial complex is the maximum dimension among its simplices.\n\nThe cycle graph $C_5$ has vertex set $V=\\{v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4,v_5\\}$ and edge set $E=\\{\\{v_1,v_2\\},\\{v_2,v_3\\},\\{v_3,v_4\\},\\{v_4,v_5\\},\\{v_5,v_1\\}\\}$. Each vertex has degree $2$, and the graph contains exactly the $5$ edges that connect consecutive vertices along the cycle. There are no chords, meaning that there are no edges of the form $\\{v_i,v_j\\}$ where $|i-j| \\notin \\{1,4\\}$ (indices taken modulo $5$).\n\nWe now identify all simplices in the clique complex:\n- $0$-simplices correspond to $1$-cliques, i.e., single vertices. Therefore, all vertices are $0$-simplices: $v_1$, $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_4$, $v_5$.\n- $1$-simplices correspond to $2$-cliques, i.e., edges. Therefore, all edges are $1$-simplices: $\\{v_1,v_2\\}$, $\\{v_2,v_3\\}$, $\\{v_3,v_4\\}$, $\\{v_4,v_5\\}$, $\\{v_5,v_1\\}$.\n- $2$-simplices would correspond to $3$-cliques, i.e., triangles. We claim there are none.\n\nTo explain why triangles (and thus $2$-simplices) are absent, we use only the structural properties of $C_5$. A triangle requires three vertices $\\{u,w,x\\}$ such that each of the three pairs $\\{u,w\\}$, $\\{w,x\\}$, and $\\{u,x\\}$ is an edge in $E$. In $C_5$, edges exist only between consecutive vertices along the cycle. Consider any three distinct vertices of $C_5$. There are two possibilities for their positions along the cycle:\n- They include at least one pair of nonconsecutive vertices. Such a pair cannot be adjacent in $C_5$ because $C_5$ has no chords, so the pair is not an edge. Hence the triple cannot be a $3$-clique.\n- They are chosen consecutively (for instance, $v_i$, $v_{i+1}$, $v_{i+2}$, with indices modulo $5$). In this case, the edges $\\{v_i,v_{i+1}\\}$ and $\\{v_{i+1},v_{i+2}\\}$ exist, but the edge $\\{v_i,v_{i+2}\\}$ does not, since $v_i$ and $v_{i+2}$ are not consecutive. Again, the triple is not a $3$-clique.\n\nThus, for any choice of three vertices, at least one pair is nonadjacent, and no three vertices form a complete subgraph. Therefore, there are no $3$-cliques in $C_5$, which implies that the clique complex of $C_5$ has no $2$-simplices.\n\nSince the clique complex contains $0$-simplices and $1$-simplices, but no $2$-simplices or higher, the maximal simplex dimension is $1$. This also aligns with the general observation derived from definitions: the maximal dimension of the clique complex equals $\\omega(G)-1$, where $\\omega(G)$ is the size of a largest clique in $G$. For $C_5$, the largest clique size is $2$ (any edge), hence the maximal simplex dimension is $2-1=1$.\n\nTherefore, the maximal simplex dimension of the clique complex of $C_5$ is $1$.",

This involves constructing the simplicial chain complex over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_2$ and computing the dimensions of its homology groups.\n\nFirst, we identify the simplices of the clique complex of $C_4$. The graph $C_4$ has vertices $v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4$ and edges $\\{v_1, v_2\\}, \\{v_2, v_3\\}, \\{v_3, v_4\\}, \\{v_4, v_1\\}$. A clique is a subset of vertices where every pair is connected by an edge.\n- The $0$-simplices are the vertices: $[v_1], [v_2], [v_3], [v_4]$. There are $4$ such simplices.\n- The $1$-simplices are the edges, as they are the only cliques of size $2$: $[v_1, v_2], [v_2, v_3], [v_3, v_4], [v_4, v_1]$. There are $4$ such simplices.\n- There are no cliques of size $3$ (triangles) or larger in $C_4$. For example, $v_1$ is adjacent to $v_2$ and $v_4$, but $v_2$ and $v_4$ are not adjacent. Thus, there are no $2$-simplices or higher-dimensional simplices in the clique complex.\n\nThe chain groups $C_k$ are $\\mathbb{F}_2$-vector spaces whose bases are the $k$-simplices.\n- $C_0$ is a vector space of dimension $4$, with the ordered basis given as $([v_1], [v_2], [v_3], [v_4])$.\n- $C_1$ is a vector space of dimension $4$, with the ordered basis given as $(e_{12}, e_{23}, e_{34}, e_{41})$, which correspond to $([v_1, v_2], [v_2, v_3], [v_3, v_4], [v_4, v_1])$.\n- Since there are no $2$-simplices, the chain group $C_2$ is the trivial vector space $\\{0\\}$, so its dimension is $\\dim(C_2) = 0$. Consequently, $C_k=\\{0\\}$ for all $k \\ge 2$.\n\nThe boundary operators $\\partial_k: C_k \\to C_{k-1}$ are defined by $\\partial_k [v_0,\\dots,v_k] = \\sum_{i=0}^{k} [v_0,\\dots,\\widehat{v_i},\\dots,v_k]$. All arithmetic is in $\\mathbb{F}_2$, where $1+1=0$, so addition is equivalent to subtraction.\n\n**1. Boundary Matrices $\\partial_1$ and $\\partial_2$**\n\nThe boundary operator $\\partial_2: C_2 \\to C_1$ maps from a zero-dimensional space ($C_2=\\{0\\}$) to a $4$-dimensional space ($C_1$). The only possible linear map is the zero map. Its matrix representation is a $4 \\times 0$ empty matrix. The image is $\\operatorname{im} \\partial_2 = \\{0\\}$.\n\nThe boundary operator $\\partial_1: C_1 \\to C_0$ is represented by a matrix whose columns are the images of the basis vectors of $C_1$ expressed in the basis of $C_0$. The basis for $C_1$ is $([v_1, v_2], [v_2, v_3], [v_3, v_4], [v_4, v_1])$ and for $C_0$ is $([v_1], [v_2], [v_3], [v_4])$.\n- $\\partial_1 [v_1, v_2] = [v_2] + [v_1]$. This corresponds to the column vector $(1, 1, 0, 0)^T$.\n- $\\partial_1 [v_2, v_3] = [v_3] + [v_2]$. This corresponds to the column vector $(0, 1, 1, 0)^T$.\n- $\\partial_1 [v_3, v_4] = [v_4] + [v_3]$. This corresponds to the column vector $(0, 0, 1, 1)^T$.\n- $\\partial_1 [v_4, v_1] = [v_1] + [v_4]$. This corresponds to the column vector $(1, 0, 0, 1)^T$.\n\nAssembling these columns, the matrix for $\\partial_1$ is:\n$$\n\\partial_1 =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n**2. Betti Numbers $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$**\n\nThe $k$-th Betti number $\\beta_k$ is the dimension of the $k$-th homology group $H_k = \\ker \\partial_k / \\operatorname{im} \\partial_{k+1}$. Its dimension is given by $\\beta_k = \\dim(\\ker \\partial_k) - \\dim(\\operatorname{im} \\partial_{k+1})$. The rank-nullity theorem states $\\dim(C_k) = \\dim(\\ker \\partial_k) + \\dim(\\operatorname{im} \\partial_k)$, and $\\dim(\\operatorname{im} \\partial_k) = \\operatorname{rank}(\\partial_k)$.\n\n**Calculation of $\\beta_0$**:\n$\\beta_0 = \\dim(H_0) = \\dim(\\ker \\partial_0 / \\operatorname{im} \\partial_1)$.\nThe boundary operator $\\partial_0: C_0 \\to C_{-1}$ maps to the trivial vector space $C_{-1}=\\{0\\}$. Therefore, $\\ker \\partial_0 = C_0$, and $\\dim(\\ker \\partial_0) = \\dim(C_0) = 4$.\nSo, $\\beta_0 = \\dim(C_0) - \\dim(\\operatorname{im} \\partial_1) = 4 - \\operatorname{rank}(\\partial_1)$.\nWe compute the rank of the matrix $\\partial_1$ over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ using row reduction:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\xrightarrow{R_2 \\to R_2+R_1}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\xrightarrow{R_3 \\to R_3+R_2}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\xrightarrow{R_4 \\to R_4+R_3}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe matrix is in row echelon form and has $3$ non-zero rows, so $\\operatorname{rank}(\\partial_1) = 3$.\nTherefore, $\\beta_0 = 4 - 3 = 1$. This corresponds to the fact that $C_4$ has one connected component.\n\n**Calculation of $\\beta_1$**:\n$\\beta_1 = \\dim(H_1) = \\dim(\\ker \\partial_1 / \\operatorname{im} \\partial_2)$.\nThis is $\\beta_1 = \\dim(\\ker \\partial_1) - \\dim(\\operatorname{im} \\partial_2)$.\nAs established, $C_2 = \\{0\\}$, so $\\partial_2$ is the zero map and $\\operatorname{im} \\partial_2 = \\{0\\}$. Thus, $\\dim(\\operatorname{im} \\partial_2) = \\operatorname{rank}(\\partial_2) = 0$.\nSo, $\\beta_1 = \\dim(\\ker \\partial_1)$.\nUsing the rank-nullity theorem for the map $\\partial_1: C_1 \\to C_0$:\n$\\dim(C_1) = \\operatorname{rank}(\\partial_1) + \\dim(\\ker \\partial_1)$.\nWe know $\\dim(C_1) = 4$ and we just calculated $\\operatorname{rank}(\\partial_1) = 3$.\nSo, $\\dim(\\ker \\partial_1) = \\dim(C_1) - \\operatorname{rank}(\\partial_1) = 4 - 3 = 1$.\nTherefore, $\\beta_1 = 1$. This corresponds to the single $1$-dimensional hole in the graph $C_4$.\n\nThe computed Betti numbers are $\\beta_0 = 1$ and $\\beta_1 = 1$.",

            "solution": "First, we verify the degree distributions of networks $\\mathcal{A}$ and $\\mathcal{B}$. The problem specifies that the degree of a vertex is defined for the underlying unweighted graph. Both networks are defined on the vertex set $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ and have all six possible edges present, which means the underlying unweighted graph for both is the complete graph $K_4$. In $K_4$, each vertex is connected to the other $4-1=3$ vertices. Therefore, every vertex in both networks $\\mathcal{A}$ and $\\mathcal{B}$ has a degree of $3$. The degree sequence for both networks is $(3,3,3,3)$, and they trivially have identical degree distributions.\n\nNext, we derive the $H_1$ persistence diagram for each network. The process involves constructing a Vietoris–Rips filtration based on the dissimilarity values $\\delta_{ij} = 1 - w_{ij}$. A $k$-simplex is added to the filtration at a parameter value $\\varepsilon$ if all its constituent edges have dissimilarities less than or equal to $\\varepsilon$. A $1$-dimensional homology class (a cycle or hole) is born at the filtration time $\\varepsilon_b$ corresponding to the maximum dissimilarity of the edges forming the cycle. The class dies at the filtration time $\\varepsilon_d$ when it becomes the boundary of a $2$-chain (a collection of triangles, or $2$-simplices).\n\nFor network $\\mathcal{A}$:\nThe similarity weights are $w_{12}=w_{23}=w_{34}=w_{41}=0.9$, $w_{13}=0.4$, and $w_{24}=0.3$.\nThe corresponding dissimilarities are:\n$\\delta_{12} = 1-0.9 = 0.1$\n$\\delta_{23} = 1-0.9 = 0.1$\n$\\delta_{34} = 1-0.9 = 0.1$\n$\\delta_{41} = 1-0.9 = 0.1$\n$\\delta_{13} = 1-0.4 = 0.6$\n$\\delta_{24} = 1-0.3 = 0.7$\n\nThe filtration proceeds as follows:\nAt $\\varepsilon=0.1$, the edges $(1,2)$, $(2,3)$, $(3,4)$, and $(4,1)$ are added to the complex. These edges form a cycle $C = 1 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 1$. The birth time of this cycle is the maximum dissimilarity of its edges, which is $b = 0.1$.\nThis $1$-cycle persists until it is \"filled in\". A cycle is filled when it becomes the boundary of a $2$-chain. The cycle $C$ is not a triangle, so it is not filled by a single $2$-simplex. It can be seen as the sum of two triangular cycles, $C_{123} = 1 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 1$ and $C_{134} = 1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 1$, which meet along the edge $(1,3)$. With proper orientation, $C$ is homologous to the sum of the boundaries of the $2$-simplices $\\sigma_{123} = \\{1,2,3\\}$ and $\\sigma_{134} = \\{1,3,4\\}$. The cycle $C$ dies when both of these $2$-simplices are present in the filtration.\nThe formation time of a $k$-simplex is the maximum dissimilarity among all its edges.\nThe $2$-simplex $\\sigma_{123}$ is formed at $\\varepsilon = \\max(\\delta_{12}, \\delta_{23}, \\delta_{13}) = \\max(0.1, 0.1, 0.6) = 0.6$.\nThe $2$-simplex $\\sigma_{134}$ is formed at $\\varepsilon = \\max(\\delta_{13}, \\delta_{34}, \\delta_{41}) = \\max(0.6, 0.1, 0.1) = 0.6$.\nThe cycle $C$ dies at the time when the entire $2$-chain that bounds it exists, which is $\\varepsilon_d = \\max(0.6, 0.6) = 0.6$.\nThis gives one persistence pair $(b, d) = (0.1, 0.6)$.\nOther cycles that are formed, such as the triangle $1 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 1$, are born at $\\varepsilon=0.6$ (due to edge $(1,3)$) and are immediately killed at $\\varepsilon=0.6$ by the formation of the $2$-simplex $\\{1,2,3\\}$. Such pairs $(0.6, 0.6)$ lie on the diagonal and are not part of the persistence diagram. The same logic applies to all other triangular cycles.\nThus, the $H_1$ persistence diagram for network $\\mathcal{A}$, denoted $D_A$, contains a single off-diagonal point: $D_A = \\{(0.1, 0.6)\\}$.\n\nFor network $\\mathcal{B}$:\nThe similarity weights are $w_{12}=w_{23}=w_{34}=w_{41}=0.9$, $w_{13}=0.95$, and $w_{24}=0.95$.\nThe corresponding dissimilarities are:\n$\\delta_{12} = 1-0.9 = 0.1$\n$\\delta_{23} = 1-0.9 = 0.1$\n$\\delta_{34} = 1-0.9 = 0.1$\n$\\delta_{41} = 1-0.9 = 0.1$\n$\\delta_{13} = 1-0.95 = 0.05$\n$\\delta_{24} = 1-0.95 = 0.05$\n\nThe filtration proceeds as follows:\nAt $\\varepsilon=0.05$, edges $(1,3)$ and $(2,4)$ are added.\nAt $\\varepsilon=0.1$, edges $(1,2)$, $(2,3)$, $(3,4)$, and $(4,1)$ are added. At this point, the graph is the complete graph $K_4$.\nIn this filtration, any $1$-cycle must be a combination of triangular cycles. Let's analyze the birth and death of these triangular cycles.\nConsider the cycle $1 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 1$. Its edges are $(1,2)$, $(2,3)$, and $(1,3)$ with dissimilarities $0.1$, $0.1$, and $0.05$. The birth time of this cycle is $b = \\max(0.1, 0.1, 0.05) = 0.1$.\nThis cycle is bounded by the $2$-simplex $\\sigma_{123}=\\{1,2,3\\}$, which is formed at time $\\varepsilon_d = \\max(\\delta_{12}, \\delta_{23}, \\delta_{13}) = \\max(0.1, 0.1, 0.05) = 0.1$.\nSo, this cycle is born at $0.1$ and dies at $0.1$, yielding a persistence pair $(0.1, 0.1)$, which lies on the diagonal.\nLet's check the other faces of the tetrahedron $K_4$:\n- Cycle $1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 1$: $b=d=\\max(\\delta_{13}, \\delta_{34}, \\delta_{41}) = \\max(0.05, 0.1, 0.1)=0.1$.\n- Cycle $1 \\to 2 \\to 4 \\to 1$: $b=d=\\max(\\delta_{12}, \\delta_{24}, \\delta_{41}) = \\max(0.1, 0.05, 0.1)=0.1$.\n- Cycle $2 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 2$: $b=d=\\max(\\delta_{23}, \\delta_{34}, \\delta_{24}) = \\max(0.1, 0.1, 0.05)=0.1$.\nAll fundamental $1$-cycles are born and die at the same filtration value. Therefore, the $H_1$ persistence diagram for network $\\mathcal{B}$, denoted $D_B$, has no off-diagonal points.\n\nFinally, we compute the bottleneck distance $d_B(D_A, D_B)$. The bottleneck distance is defined as $d_B(D_1, D_2) = \\inf_{\\eta} \\sup_{p \\in D_1} ||p - \\eta(p)||_{\\infty}$, where $\\eta$ is a bijection between the (multi)sets of points $D_1 \\cup \\Delta$ and $D_2 \\cup \\Delta$, and $\\Delta = \\{(x,x) | x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$ is the diagonal.\nWe have $D_A = \\{(0.1, 0.6)\\}$ and $D_B = \\emptyset$. To find the distance, we must find an optimal matching between the points in $D_A$ and $D_B$. The single point $p_A = (0.1, 0.6)$ in $D_A$ must be matched to a point on the diagonal $\\Delta$, as $D_B$ has no off-diagonal points. The cost of this matching is the $L_{\\infty}$ distance from $p_A$ to its closest point on the diagonal.\nFor a point $(b,d)$, its $L_{\\infty}$ distance to the diagonal is given by $\\frac{d-b}{2}$. This minimum distance is achieved at the diagonal point $(\\frac{b+d}{2}, \\frac{b+d}{2})$.\nThe cost of matching $p_A=(0.1, 0.6)$ to the diagonal is the value of the bottleneck distance, as all other points (on the diagonal in $D_A$) can be matched to themselves in $D_B$ with zero cost.\n$d_B(D_A, D_B) = \\frac{0.6 - 0.1}{2} = \\frac{0.5}{2} = 0.25$.\nThis distance corresponds to matching the point $(0.1, 0.6)$ with the diagonal point $(0.35, 0.35)$, for which the $L_\\infty$ distance is $\\max(|0.1 - 0.35|, |0.6 - 0.35|) = \\max(0.25, 0.25) = 0.25$.\nThe final value of the bottleneck distance is $0.25$.",
