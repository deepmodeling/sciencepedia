Proceeding to the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution will be developed in three parts: first, the derivation of the conductance $\\phi(C_n)$; second, the derivation of the second smallest eigenvalue $\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L})$ of the normalized Laplacian; and third, an analysis of their asymptotic behavior in the context of the Cheeger inequality.\n\n**1. Calculation of the Conductance $\\phi(C_{n})$**\n\nThe conductance is defined as $\\phi(G) = \\min_{\\emptyset \\neq S \\subsetneq V} \\frac{|\\partial S|}{\\min\\{\\mathrm{vol}(S), \\mathrm{vol}(V \\setminus S)\\}}$.\nFor the cycle graph $C_n$, every vertex has degree $2$. Thus, for any subset of vertices $S \\subset V$ with cardinality $|S| = k$, the volume of the set is $\\mathrm{vol}(S) = \\sum_{v \\in S} \\deg(v) = \\sum_{v \\in S} 2 = 2k$.\nSimilarly, the volume of the complement set $V \\setminus S$ is $\\mathrm{vol}(V \\setminus S) = 2(n-k)$.\nThe denominator of the conductance expression becomes $\\min\\{\\mathrm{vol}(S), \\mathrm{vol}(V \\setminus S)\\} = \\min\\{2k, 2(n-k)\\} = 2\\min\\{k, n-k\\}$.\nThe expression for the conductance of $C_n$ simplifies to:\n$$\n\\phi(C_{n}) = \\min_{S \\subset V, 1 \\le |S| \\le n-1} \\frac{|\\partial S|}{2\\min\\{|S|, n-|S|\\}}\n$$\nTo find the minimum, we must consider the structure of the cut set $|\\partial S|$ for a given size $|S|=k$. To minimize the number of edges cut for a fixed number of vertices $k$, the vertices in $S$ should be chosen to be as \"clustered\" as possible. In a cycle graph, this means selecting a contiguous block of vertices. Let $S_k = \\{v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_k\\}$ be a set of $k$ consecutive vertices. The edges within this block are $(v_i, v_{i+1})$ for $i=1, \\ldots, k-1$. The edges connecting $S_k$ to its complement $V \\setminus S_k$ are the edge between $v_k$ and $v_{k+1}$ and the edge between $v_1$ and $v_n$. Thus, for any such contiguous block $S_k$ (where $1 \\le k \\le n-1$), the size of the edge boundary is $|\\partial S_k| = 2$.\nAny other choice of $S$ with $|S|=k$ which is not a single contiguous block can be seen as a union of at least two disjoint contiguous blocks. Each such block would contribute at least $2$ edges to the cut (unless a block is of size $n-1$), so $|\\partial S|$ would be greater than or equal to $4$. Therefore, the minimum value of $|\\partial S|$ for any fixed $k$ is $2$, achieved by taking a contiguous block of vertices.\n\nThe problem of computing the conductance reduces to minimizing the following expression over $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, n-1\\}$:\n$$\n\\frac{2}{2\\min\\{k, n-k\\}} = \\frac{1}{\\min\\{k, n-k\\}}\n$$\nTo minimize this fraction, we must maximize the denominator $\\min\\{k, n-k\\}$. The function $f(k) = \\min\\{k, n-k\\}$ increases for $k \\le n/2$ and decreases for $k > n/2$. Its maximum value is achieved when $k$ is as close to $n/2$ as possible, i.e., at $k = \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ or $k = \\lceil n/2 \\rceil$. The maximum value of $\\min\\{k, n-k\\}$ is $\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$.\n\nTherefore, the conductance of $C_n$ is:\n$$\n\\phi(C_n) = \\frac{1}{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor}\n$$\n\n**2. Calculation of the Second Smallest Eigenvalue $\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L})$**\n\nThe normalized Laplacian is $\\mathcal{L} = I - D^{-1/2} A D^{-1/2}$. For the $2$-regular graph $C_n$, the degree matrix is $D=2I$. Thus, $D^{-1/2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}I$.\nThe Laplacian simplifies to $\\mathcal{L} = I - (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}I) A (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}I) = I - \\frac{1}{2}A$.\nThe eigenvalues of $\\mathcal{L}$, which we denote by $\\lambda_j(\\mathcal{L})$, are related to the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix $A$, which we denote by $\\mu_j(A)$, by the relation $\\lambda_j(\\mathcal{L}) = 1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_j(A)$.\n\nThe adjacency matrix of $C_n$ is a circulant matrix whose first row is $(0, 1, 0, \\ldots, 0, 1)$. The eigenvalues of such a matrix are given by the formula $\\mu_j(A) = 2\\cos(2\\pi j/n)$ for $j=0, 1, \\ldots, n-1$.\nThe eigenvalues of the normalized Laplacian $\\mathcal{L}$ are therefore:\n$$\n\\lambda_j(\\mathcal{L}) = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi j}{n}\\right) \\right) = 1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi j}{n}\\right) \\quad \\text{for } j=0, 1, \\ldots, n-1\n$$\nWe need to find the second smallest of these eigenvalues. The eigenvalues are sorted in non-decreasing order: $\\lambda_1(\\mathcal{L}) \\le \\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L}) \\le \\ldots \\le \\lambda_n(\\mathcal{L})$.\nThe smallest eigenvalue occurs at $j=0$:\n$\\lambda_1(\\mathcal{L}) = 1 - \\cos(0) = 1 - 1 = 0$. This corresponds to the connected component of the graph.\nThe function $f(x) = 1-\\cos(x)$ is non-negative and increasing for $x \\in [0, \\pi]$. The arguments $\\frac{2\\pi j}{n}$ for $j=1, 2, \\ldots, \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ lie in this range. The second smallest eigenvalue, $\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L})$, corresponds to the smallest non-zero argument, which is for $j=1$.\nThus, the second smallest eigenvalue is:\n$$\n\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L}) = 1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\right)\n$$\nNote that this eigenvalue has multiplicity $2$ (coming from $j=1$ and $j=n-1$) since $\\cos(2\\pi/n) = \\cos(2\\pi(n-1)/n)$. So technically $\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L}) = \\lambda_3(\\mathcal{L})$.\n\n**3. Asymptotic Scaling and the Cheeger Inequality**\n\nThe Cheeger inequality relates the conductance to the second smallest eigenvalue of the normalized Laplacian:\n$$\n\\frac{\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L})}{2} \\le \\phi(G) \\le \\sqrt{2\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L})}\n$$\nLet's analyze the leading-order asymptotic scaling of our derived quantities as $n \\to \\infty$.\n\nFor the conductance:\n$\\phi(C_n) = \\frac{1}{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor}$. As $n \\to \\infty$, $\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor \\approx n/2$.\nSo, $\\phi(C_n) \\sim \\frac{1}{n/2} = \\frac{2}{n}$. The conductance scales as $O(n^{-1})$.\n\nFor the eigenvalue:\n$\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L}) = 1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\right)$. For large $n$, the argument $\\frac{2\\pi}{n}$ is small. We use the Taylor series expansion of $\\cos(x)$ around $x=0$, which is $\\cos(x) = 1 - \\frac{x^2}{2!} + O(x^4)$.\n$$\n\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L}) = 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\right)^2 + O(n^{-4})\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{4\\pi^2}{n^2} + O(n^{-4}) = \\frac{2\\pi^2}{n^2} + O(n^{-4})\n$$\nSo, $\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L}) \\sim \\frac{2\\pi^2}{n^2}$. The eigenvalue scales as $O(n^{-2})$.\n\nThese scalings align with the qualitative expectations from the Cheeger inequality. As $n \\to \\infty$, both $\\phi(C_n)$ and $\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L})$ approach $0$. This reflects the fact that a long cycle graph is \"easy to cut\" and is thus a poor expander graph. The Cheeger inequality provides the formal link: a small spectral gap $\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L})$ implies a small conductance $\\phi(G)$.\n\nMore quantitatively, let's check the scaling in the inequality:\n- Lower bound: $\\frac{\\lambda_2}{2} \\sim \\frac{\\pi^2}{n^2}$, which is $O(n^{-2})$.\n- Conductance: $\\phi \\sim \\frac{2}{n}$, which is $O(n^{-1})$.\n- Upper bound: $\\sqrt{2\\lambda_2} \\sim \\sqrt{2 \\cdot \\frac{2\\pi^2}{n^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\pi^2}{n^2}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{n}$, which is $O(n^{-1})$.\n\nThe inequality $O(n^{-2}) \\le O(n^{-1}) \\le O(n^{-1})$ holds for large $n$. Notably, the asymptotic scaling of the conductance $\\phi(C_n)$ matches that of the Cheeger upper bound $\\sqrt{2\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L})}$. This indicates that for the family of cycle graphs, the upper bound of the Cheeger inequality is asymptotically tight up to a constant factor ($\\pi$ in this case). This provides a concrete verification of the deep connection between the geometric property of conductance and the algebraic property of the Laplacian spectrum.\n\nThe required closed-form expressions are $\\phi(C_n) = \\frac{1}{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor}$ and $\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L}) = 1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\right)$.",

It is scientifically grounded in established principles of spectral graph theory, well-posed with a clear and consistent set of definitions and constraints, and formulated objectively. All terms, such as the symmetric normalized Laplacian, conductance, and the Rayleigh quotient, are standard in the field of network science. The graph construction is a well-known example (a dumbbell graph), and the task is a standard application of these theoretical concepts.\n\nWe proceed with the solution, which is divided into two parts: first, the computation of the exact graph conductance $\\phi(G)$, and second, the estimation of the second-smallest eigenvalue $\\lambda_{2}(\\mathcal{L})$ using the specified test function.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the Graph Conductance $\\phi(G)$**\n\nThe graph $G$ is composed of two disjoint cliques, each a $K_m$, which we will denote as $V_1$ and $V_2$. Each clique has $m$ vertices. Let $v_b \\in V_1$ and $u_b \\in V_2$ be the designated bridge vertices. A single edge connects $v_b$ and $u_b$. The total number of vertices in the graph is $|V| = 2m$.\n\nFirst, we determine the degrees of the vertices.\n- For any non-bridge vertex $v \\in V_1 \\setminus \\{v_b\\}$, it is connected to the other $m-1$ vertices within its clique $K_m$. Thus, its degree is $d_v = m-1$. There are $m-1$ such vertices in $V_1$.\n- The bridge vertex $v_b \\in V_1$ is connected to the $m-1$ other vertices in $V_1$ and to the bridge vertex $u_b$ in $V_2$. Thus, its degree is $d_{v_b} = (m-1) + 1 = m$.\n- By symmetry, the degrees of the vertices in $V_2$ are identical: $d_u = m-1$ for non-bridge vertices $u \\in V_2 \\setminus \\{u_b\\}$ and $d_{u_b} = m$ for the bridge vertex.\n\nNext, we compute the volume of a set of vertices $S$, defined as $\\mathrm{vol}(S) = \\sum_{i \\in S} d_i$.\n- The volume of the first clique $V_1$ is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{vol}(V_1) = \\sum_{v \\in V_1} d_v = (m-1)(m-1) + 1(m) = m^2 - 2m + 1 + m = m^2 - m + 1\n$$\n- By symmetry, the volume of the second clique $V_2$ is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{vol}(V_2) = m^2 - m + 1\n$$\n- The total volume of the graph is $\\mathrm{vol}(G) = \\mathrm{vol}(V_1) + \\mathrm{vol}(V_2) = 2(m^2 - m + 1)$.\n\nThe graph conductance is $\\phi(G) = \\min_{S \\subset V} \\phi(S)$, where $\\phi(S) = \\frac{\\mathrm{cut}(S, \\bar{S})}{\\min(\\mathrm{vol}(S), \\mathrm{vol}(\\bar{S}))}$.\nThe structure of the graph, with two dense clusters connected by a single edge, suggests that the minimum conductance cut will separate the two cliques. Let's consider the partition where $S = V_1$ and its complement is $\\bar{S} = V_2$.\n- The cut size, $\\mathrm{cut}(V_1, V_2)$, is the number of edges between $V_1$ and $V_2$. There is only the single bridge edge, so $\\mathrm{cut}(V_1, V_2) = 1$.\n- The volumes are $\\mathrm{vol}(V_1) = m^2 - m + 1$ and $\\mathrm{vol}(V_2) = m^2 - m + 1$.\n- Therefore, $\\min(\\mathrm{vol}(V_1), \\mathrm{vol}(V_2)) = m^2 - m + 1$.\n- The conductance of this partition is:\n$$\n\\phi(V_1) = \\frac{1}{m^2 - m + 1}\n$$\nThis partition represents the natural bottleneck of the graph. Any other cut that, for example, separates a single vertex from the rest, would result in a higher conductance value. For dumbbell graphs of this type, it is a standard result that this partition provides the minimum conductance. Thus, the graph conductance is:\n$$\n\\phi(G) = \\frac{1}{m^2 - m + 1}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Approximation of $\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L})$**\n\nWe need to compute an approximation for $\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L})$ using the Rayleigh quotient $\\mathcal{R}(f)$ of a specifically constructed test function $f$.\nThe test function $f$ must be:\n1.

Orthogonal to the trivial eigenvector $D^{1/2}\\mathbf{1}$, which means $\\sum_{i \\in V} f_i \\sqrt{d_i} = 0$.\n\nLet's apply the orthogonality constraint to our piecewise function:\n$$\n\\sum_{i \\in V} f_i \\sqrt{d_i} = \\sum_{i \\in V_1} (c_1 \\sqrt{d_i})\\sqrt{d_i} + \\sum_{i \\in V_2} (c_2 \\sqrt{d_i})\\sqrt{d_i} = 0\n$$\n$$\nc_1 \\sum_{i \\in V_1} d_i + c_2 \\sum_{i \\in V_2} d_i = 0\n$$\n$$\nc_1 \\, \\mathrm{vol}(V_1) + c_2 \\, \\mathrm{vol}(V_2) = 0\n$$\nSince $\\mathrm{vol}(V_1) = \\mathrm{vol}(V_2) = m^2 - m + 1$, this simplifies to $c_1(m^2 - m + 1) + c_2(m^2 - m + 1) = 0$, which implies $c_1 + c_2 = 0$, or $c_2 = -c_1$. Since the Rayleigh quotient is invariant to the scaling of $f$, we can choose $c_1 = 1$ and $c_2 = -1$.\nOur test function is:\n$$\nf_i =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\sqrt{d_i} & \\text{if } i \\in V_1 \\\\\n-\\sqrt{d_i} & \\text{if } i \\in V_2\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nNow we compute the Rayleigh quotient $\\mathcal{R}(f) = \\frac{\\text{Numerator}}{\\text{Denominator}}$.\n\n- **Numerator:** $\\sum_{(i,j) \\in E} \\left(\\frac{f_{i}}{\\sqrt{d_{i}}} - \\frac{f_{j}}{\\sqrt{d_{j}}}\\right)^{2}$\n  For any vertex $i \\in V_1$, $\\frac{f_i}{\\sqrt{d_i}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{d_i}}{\\sqrt{d_i}} = 1$.\n  For any vertex $j \\in V_2$, $\\frac{f_j}{\\sqrt{d_j}} = \\frac{-\\sqrt{d_j}}{\\sqrt{d_j}} = -1$.\n  The term $\\left(\\frac{f_{i}}{\\sqrt{d_{i}}} - \\frac{f_{j}}{\\sqrt{d_{j}}}\\right)^{2}$ is non-zero only if the edge $(i,j)$ connects a vertex in $V_1$ to one in $V_2$.\n  - If both $i, j \\in V_1$, the term is $(1-1)^2 = 0$.\n  - If both $i, j \\in V_2$, the term is $(-1 - (-1))^2 = 0$.\n  - If $i \\in V_1$ and $j \\in V_2$, the term is $(1 - (-1))^2 = 2^2 = 4$.\n  There is only one edge crossing the partition: the bridge edge $(v_b, u_b)$.

The graph construction is unambiguous, and the provided degrees are consistent with the description. The definitions of the normalized Laplacian, conductance, and volume are standard. The specified parameter regime ensures that the volume of the path component is the smaller of the two partitions being considered. The tasks are sequential and logically connected. The instruction to \"derive from first principles\" a lower bound for $\\lambda_2$ refers to the proof of the Cheeger inequality, a fundamental result. While a full, detailed proof from scratch is extensive, its basis is the variational characterization of eigenvalues, as requested. The problem is scientifically sound, formalizable, and well-posed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\n###\nThe solution is developed by following the four tasks outlined in the problem statement.\n\n**Task 1: Compute the conductance $\\phi(G_{r,m})$**\n\nWe are instructed to consider the cut defined by the vertex set $S = \\{v_{0}, v_{1}, \\dots, v_{m}\\}$. The complementary set is $S^c = V(G_{r,m}) \\setminus S = \\{u_{1}, u_{2}, \\dots, u_{r}\\}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the size of the edge boundary $|\\partial S|$. This is the number of edges with one endpoint in $S$ and the other in $S^c$. Based on the graph construction, there is only one such edge: $(u_{1}, v_{0})$. Therefore, $|\\partial S| = 1$.\n\nNext, we calculate the volume of the sets $S$ and $S^c$. The volume of a set is the sum of the degrees of its vertices.\nFor the set $S$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{vol}(S) = \\sum_{v \\in S} \\deg(v) = \\deg(v_0) + \\sum_{i=1}^{m-1} \\deg(v_i) + \\deg(v_m)\n$$\nUsing the provided degrees:\n$$\n\\mathrm{vol}(S) = 2 + (m-1) \\times 2 + 1 = 2 + 2m - 2 + 1 = 2m+1\n$$\nFor the set $S^c$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{vol}(S^c) = \\sum_{u \\in S^c} \\deg(u) = \\deg(u_1) + \\sum_{j=2}^{r} \\deg(u_j)\n$$\nUsing the provided degrees:\n$$\n\\mathrm{vol}(S^c) = r + (r-1)(r-1) = r + (r^2 - 2r + 1) = r^2 - r + 1\n$$\nThe problem specifies the regime $2m+1 \\leq r(r-1) + 1$, which is equivalent to $2m+1 \\leq r^2 - r + 1$. This confirms that $\\mathrm{vol}(S) \\leq \\mathrm{vol}(S^c)$.\nTherefore, $\\min\\{\\mathrm{vol}(S), \\mathrm{vol}(S^c)\\} = \\mathrm{vol}(S) = 2m+1$.\n\nThe conductance of this particular cut, let's call it $\\phi_S$, is:\n$$\n\\phi_S = \\frac{|\\partial S|}{\\min\\{\\mathrm{vol}(S), \\mathrm{vol}(S^c)\\}} = \\frac{1}{2m+1}\n$$\nThe problem asks for $\\phi(G_{r,m})$ to be computed by considering this specific cut, implying this cut yields the minimum conductance. The structure of the graph, a dense component linked to a sparse \"tail\" by a single edge, makes this single edge the natural bottleneck. Thus, we set $\\phi(G_{r,m}) = \\phi_S$.\n$$\n\\phi(G_{r,m}) = \\frac{1}{2m+1}\n$$\n\n**Task 2: Derive a lower bound on $\\lambda_{2}(\\mathcal{L})$**\n\nThe second-smallest eigenvalue $\\lambda_2$ of the normalized Laplacian $\\mathcal{L}$ is given by the variational characterization (or Rayleigh-Ritz principle):\n$$\n\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L}) = \\min_{f \\neq 0, \\, \\langle f, D^{1/2} \\mathbf{1} \\rangle = 0} \\frac{\\langle f, \\mathcal{L} f \\rangle}{\\langle f, f \\rangle}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{1}$ is the vector of all ones, and the orthogonality condition $\\langle f, D^{1/2} \\mathbf{1} \\rangle = 0$ ensures $f$ is orthogonal to the eigenvector of the eigenvalue $\\lambda_1=0$. By substituting $\\mathcal{L} = I - D^{-1/2}AD^{-1/2}$, the numerator becomes $\\langle f, (I - D^{-1/2}AD^{-1/2})f \\rangle$. A change of variables $f = D^{1/2}g$ transforms the quotient into a more convenient form involving the unnormalized Laplacian $L=D-A$:\n$$\n\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L}) = \\min_{g \\neq 0, \\, \\sum_v g(v) \\deg(v) = 0} \\frac{\\sum_{(u,v) \\in E} (g(u)-g(v))^2}{\\sum_v g(v)^2 \\deg(v)}\n$$\nThis characterization is the fundamental starting point for relating the spectral gap $\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L})$ to the conductance $\\phi(G)$. A rigorous argument, known as the Cheeger inequality for graphs, can be constructed from this principle. The argument involves analyzing the level sets of the eigenvector $g$ that minimizes the Rayleigh quotient. This leads to the celebrated result bounding $\\lambda_2$ from below. This is a cornerstone theorem in spectral graph theory. The inequality is:\n$$\n\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L}) \\geq \\frac{\\phi(G)^2}{2}\n$$\nThis is the rigorous lower bound derived from first principles. Applying this to the graph $G_{r,m}$ using our result from Task 1:\n$$\n\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L}(G_{r,m})) \\geq \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\phi(G_{r,m}) \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{2m+1} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2(2m+1)^2}\n$$\n\n**Task 3: Recall $\\lambda_{2}(\\mathcal{L}(K_{r}))$**\n\nThe complete graph $K_r$ is a $(r-1)$-regular graph. For any $k$-regular graph, the degree matrix is $D = kI$. The normalized Laplacian is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L} = I - D^{-1/2} A D^{-1/2} = I - \\frac{1}{k}A\n$$\nFor $K_r$, we have $k=r-1$. The eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix $A$ of $K_r$ are $r-1$ with multiplicity $1$ (eigenvector $\\mathbf{1}$), and $-1$ with multiplicity $r-1$.\nThe eigenvalues of $\\mathcal{L}(K_r)$ are given by $1 - \\frac{\\mu_i}{r-1}$, where $\\mu_i$ are the eigenvalues of $A(K_r)$.\nThe smallest eigenvalue is $\\lambda_1 = 1 - \\frac{r-1}{r-1} = 0$.\nThe other $r-1$ eigenvalues are identical:\n$$\n\\lambda_{2, \\dots, r} = 1 - \\frac{-1}{r-1} = 1 + \\frac{1}{r-1} = \\frac{r-1+1}{r-1} = \\frac{r}{r-1}\n$$\nThus, the second-smallest eigenvalue of the normalized Laplacian of the complete graph $K_r$ is:\n$$\n\\lambda_{2}(\\mathcal{L}(K_{r})) = \\frac{r}{r-1}\n$$\n\n**Task 4: Compute the degradation ratio $R(r,m)$**\n\nThe degradation ratio $R(r,m)$ is defined as the ratio of the lower bound on $\\lambda_{2}(\\mathcal{L}(G_{r,m}))$ to $\\lambda_{2}(\\mathcal{L}(K_{r}))$.\n$$\nR(r,m) = \\frac{\\text{your rigorous lower bound on } \\lambda_{2}(\\mathcal{L}(G_{r,m}))}{\\lambda_{2}(\\mathcal{L}(K_{r}))}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived in the previous tasks:\n$$\nR(r,m) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2(2m+1)^2}}{\\frac{r}{r-1}}\n$$\nSimplifying the expression gives the final answer:\n$$\nR(r,m) = \\frac{r-1}{2r(2m+1)^2}\n$$\nThis closed-form analytic expression represents how the spectral gap of the complete graph is degraded by the attachment of the path, as measured by the Cheeger inequality.",
