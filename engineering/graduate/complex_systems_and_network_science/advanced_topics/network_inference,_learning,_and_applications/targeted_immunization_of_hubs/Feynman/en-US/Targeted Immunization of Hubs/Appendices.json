            "problem": "You are given an undirected, simple network represented by an adjacency matrix $A \\in \\{0,1\\}^{n \\times n}$ with $A$ symmetric and $A_{ii} = 0$ for all $i$. Consider the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic process with infection rate $\\beta$ and recovery rate $\\mu$. A well-tested and widely used mean-field threshold condition relates the spectral radius (largest eigenvalue) $\\lambda_1(A_{\\text{res}})$ of the residual adjacency matrix $A_{\\text{res}}$ (obtained after immunization) to the dimensionless ratio $\\beta/\\mu$, stating that the epidemic dies out when the condition $(\\beta/\\mu) < 1/\\lambda_1(A_{\\text{res}})$ holds.\n\nTargeted immunization of hubs is implemented as follows. Define the degree of node $i$ as $k_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} A_{ij}$. Order the nodes in nonincreasing degree: nodes with larger $k_i$ precede nodes with smaller $k_i$, and ties are broken deterministically by ascending node index (that is, if $k_p = k_q$ and $p < q$, then node $p$ precedes node $q$). For an integer $m$ with $0 \\le m \\le n$, immunize the first $m$ nodes in this ordering, which is defined to delete the corresponding $m$ rows and $m$ columns from $A$. The residual adjacency matrix $A_{\\text{res}}$ is the principal submatrix of $A$ indexed by the remaining, non-immunized nodes. If $m = n$, the residual adjacency matrix $A_{\\text{res}}$ is the empty matrix, and by convention its largest eigenvalue is taken to be $\\lambda_1(A_{\\text{res}}) = 0$.\n\nYour task is to write a program that, for each provided test case, determines the minimal integer $m$ such that the strict inequality $1/\\lambda_1(A_{\\text{res}}) > \\beta/\\mu$ is satisfied when immunizing the first $m$ nodes in the degree-based ordering described above. If $m = 0$ already satisfies the inequality, then the minimal $m$ is $0$. If immunizing all $n$ nodes is required, then the minimal $m$ is $n$, and the inequality holds because $1/\\lambda_1(A_{\\text{res}})$ is interpreted as $+\\infty$ when $\\lambda_1(A_{\\text{res}}) = 0$ and $\\beta/\\mu$ is finite and positive.\n\nInput is implicit: your program must use the following test suite of adjacency matrices $A$ (with nodes indexed from $0$ to $n-1$) and ratios $\\beta/\\mu$. Each adjacency matrix is given as a list of lists with entries in $\\{0,1\\}$, and each ratio is a positive real number.\n\n- Test case $1$ (a path on $5$ nodes with edges $(0,1)$, $(1,2)$, $(2,3)$, $(3,4)$), with $\\beta/\\mu = 0.5$:\n  $$\n  A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n  0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n  1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n  0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  $$\n- Test case $2$ (a star on $6$ nodes with center node $0$ connected to nodes $1,2,3,4,5$), with $\\beta/\\mu = 0.6$:\n  $$\n  A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n  0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  $$\n- Test case $3$ (a complete graph on $4$ nodes), with $\\beta/\\mu = 0.8$:\n  $$\n  A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n  0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n  1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n  1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n  1 & 1 & 1 & 0\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  $$\n- Test case $4$ (a cycle on $6$ nodes with edges $(i,(i+1)\\bmod 6)$ for $i \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4,5\\}$), with $\\beta/\\mu = 0.9$:\n  $$\n  A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n  0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n  1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  $$\n- Test case $5$ (a complete graph on $3$ nodes), with $\\beta/\\mu = 0.5$:\n  $$\n  A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n  0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n  1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n  1 & 1 & 0\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  $$\n\nYour program must compute, for each test case, the minimal integer $m$ satisfying $1/\\lambda_1(A_{\\text{res}}) > \\beta/\\mu$ under the targeted immunization rule defined above. For numerical computation of $\\lambda_1(A_{\\text{res}})$, the adjacency matrices are symmetric and real; use a method appropriate for symmetric matrices. If $A_{\\text{res}}$ is empty (that is, all nodes are immunized), define $\\lambda_1(A_{\\text{res}}) = 0$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, ordered in the same sequence as the test cases, for example $[m_1,m_2,m_3,m_4,m_5]$. The outputs are integers and no physical units are involved.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the minimum number of nodes, $m$, to immunize in a network to suppress an epidemic, based on a given threshold condition. The immunization strategy is targeted, prioritizing nodes with the highest degree.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the condition for epidemic eradication, given by the mean-field theory for a Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) process on a network. The condition states that the epidemic will die out if the effective spreading rate is less than one. This translates to the inequality:\n$$\n\\frac{\\beta}{\\mu} \\lambda_1(A_{\\text{res}})  1\n$$\nwhere $\\beta$ is the infection rate, $\\mu$ is the recovery rate, and $\\lambda_1(A_{\\text{res}})$ is the spectral radius (the largest eigenvalue) of the adjacency matrix $A_{\\text{res}}$ of the residual network after immunization. The problem statement presents this strict inequality in the equivalent form:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda_1(A_{\\text{res}})} > \\frac{\\beta}{\\mu}\n$$\nThis can be rearranged into a more computationally convenient form. Let $\\tau = \\beta/\\mu$ be the given ratio. We are looking for the smallest $m$ such that:\n$$\n\\lambda_1(A_{\\text{res}})  \\frac{1}{\\tau} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\lambda_1(A_{\\text{res}})  \\frac{\\mu}{\\beta}\n$$\nLet's define the threshold for the spectral radius as $\\lambda_{\\text{th}} = \\mu / \\beta$. Our goal is to find the minimum integer $m \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ such that $\\lambda_1(A_{\\text{res}})  \\lambda_{\\text{th}}$.\n\nThe process to determine the minimal $m$ for a given network $A$ and ratio $\\tau = \\beta/\\mu$ follows a clear algorithmic procedure. We must iterate through possible values of $m$, starting from $m=0$, and for each $m$, check if the condition is satisfied. The first value of $m$ for which the condition holds is the minimal value.\n\nThe steps for each test case are as follows:\n1.  **Node Ordering for Immunization**: First, we must establish the priority order for immunization. This order is based on node degree, a measure of a node's connectivity.\n    a.  For each node $i$ in the network (indexed from $0$ to $n-1$), calculate its degree $k_i$, which is the sum of entries in the $i$-th row (or column) of the adjacency matrix $A$: $k_i = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} A_{ij}$.\n    b.  Create a list of all nodes, represented by their indices $\\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$.\n    c.  Sort this list of nodes in non-increasing order of their degrees.\n    d.  According to the problem's rule, any ties in degree are resolved by sorting the tied nodes by their original index in ascending order. This creates a unique, deterministic ordering of nodes for immunization.\n\n2.  **Iterative Search for Minimal $m$**: We search for the minimal number of immunized nodes $m$ by checking values sequentially, from $m=0$ to $m=n$.\n    a.  The loop begins with $m=0$, representing the case of no immunization.\n    b.  For a given $m$, we identify the set of nodes to be immunized. This set consists of the first $m$ nodes from the sorted list determined in Step 1. The remaining $n-m$ nodes form the residual network.\n    c.  Construct the residual adjacency matrix, $A_{\\text{res}}$. This is the principal submatrix of the original matrix $A$ formed by selecting only the rows and columns corresponding to the non-immunized (residual) nodes.\n    d.  Compute the spectral radius $\\lambda_1(A_{\\text{res}})$ of this residual matrix.\n        i.  If $m=n$, all nodes are immunized. The residual network is empty. By the problem's convention, the spectral radius of the empty matrix is $\\lambda_1(A_{\\text{res}}) = 0$.\n        ii. If $0 \\le m  n$, the residual network is non-empty. Since the original adjacency matrix $A$ is real and symmetric, any principal submatrix $A_{\\text{res}}$ is also real and symmetric. Therefore, all its eigenvalues are real. Furthermore, because the entries of $A_{\\text{res}}$ are non-negative, the Perron-Frobenius theorem guarantees that its spectral radius (largest eigenvalue) is real, non-negative, and is equal to its largest eigenvalue. We can compute all eigenvalues and find the maximum.\n    e.  Compare the computed spectral radius $\\lambda_1(A_{\\text{res}})$ with the threshold $\\lambda_{\\text{th}} = \\mu/\\beta$.\n    f.  If the condition $\\lambda_1(A_{\\text{res}})  \\lambda_{\\text{th}}$ is satisfied, the current value of $m$ is the minimal number of immunizations required. We record this value as the solution for the current test case and stop the search for this case.\n    g.  If the condition is not met, we increment $m$ by $1$ and repeat from step 2b. The process is guaranteed to terminate, as for $m=n$, $\\lambda_1(A_{\\text{res}}) = 0$, and the condition $0  \\lambda_{\\text{th}}$ will always be true since $\\beta$ and $\\mu$ are positive rates.\n\nFor implementation, we use numerical libraries to perform matrix operations. Specifically, for a given $A_{\\text{res}}$, we can use an eigenvalue solver optimized for real symmetric matrices to find its eigenvalues. The largest of these real values is the spectral radius $\\lambda_1(A_{\\text{res}})$. This systematic process is applied to each of the provided test cases to find the corresponding minimal $m$.",

            "problem": "A public health agency is planning a targeted vaccination campaign to prevent large outbreaks of a respiratory infection spreading through a large urban contact network. Empirical studies suggest the contact network is well-approximated by an uncorrelated configuration model with a scale-free degree distribution of the form $P(k) \\propto k^{-\\gamma}$ for $k \\ge k_{\\min}$. Assume the degree exponent is $\\gamma = 2.5$ and the minimum degree is $k_{\\min} = 1$. The infection is modeled as susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) transmission on the network with per-edge transmissibility $T = 0.2$ over the full infectious period.\n\nThe agency uses a targeted strategy that vaccinates all individuals with degree $k  k_{c}$ (so that these individuals are fully protected and removed from transmission). Use the following heuristic approximation: after vaccination, the residual network of unvaccinated individuals is described by the original degree density truncated at $k_{c}$ and renormalized over $k \\in [k_{\\min}, k_{c}]$. Assume the network is large and uncorrelated so that tree-like approximations hold.\n\nStarting from the fundamental branching-process criterion that a large outbreak cannot occur when the expected number of new infections generated by an infection reached via a random edge is no greater than one, derive the critical cutoff $k_{c}$ that places the residual network exactly at the epidemic threshold, and then compute the corresponding critical vaccination fraction $f$ (the fraction of the population vaccinated, i.e., all nodes with $k  k_{c}$).

We then compute the fraction of the population, $f$, that must be vaccinated.\n\n**1. Epidemic Threshold Condition**\nThe problem uses a branching-process criterion for the SIR epidemic threshold on an uncorrelated network. A large outbreak is avoided if the expected number of secondary infections from a node reached via a random edge is less than or equal to one. At the threshold, this value is exactly one:\n$$ T \\frac{\\langle k^2 \\rangle' - \\langle k \\rangle'}{\\langle k \\rangle'} = 1 $$\nwhere $T$ is the transmissibility, and $\\langle k \\rangle'$ and $\\langle k^2 \\rangle'$ are the first and second moments of the degree distribution of the residual (unvaccinated) network.

Moments of the Residual Network**\nThe vaccination strategy removes all nodes with degree $k  k_c$. The residual network thus contains nodes with degrees in the range $[k_{\\min}, k_c]$. The degree distribution $P(k)$ is proportional to $k^{-\\gamma}$. For a large network, we can use a continuous approximation. The probability density of the residual network, $P'(k)$, is given by $P'(k) = C' k^{-\\gamma}$ for $k \\in [k_{\\min}, k_c]$.\nThe moments are calculated by integrating over this distribution:\n$$ \\langle k \\rangle' = \\frac{\\int_{k_{\\min}}^{k_c} k \\cdot k^{-\\gamma} dk}{\\int_{k_{\\min}}^{k_c} k^{-\\gamma} dk} = \\frac{\\int_{k_{\\min}}^{k_c} k^{1-\\gamma} dk}{\\int_{k_{\\min}}^{k_c} k^{-\\gamma} dk} = \\frac{ \\frac{k_c^{2-\\gamma} - k_{\\min}^{2-\\gamma}}{2-\\gamma} }{ \\frac{k_c^{1-\\gamma} - k_{\\min}^{1-\\gamma}}{1-\\gamma} } $$\n$$ \\langle k^2 \\rangle' = \\frac{\\int_{k_{\\min}}^{k_c} k^2 \\cdot k^{-\\gamma} dk}{\\int_{k_{\\min}}^{k_c} k^{-\\gamma} dk} = \\frac{\\int_{k_{\\min}}^{k_c} k^{2-\\gamma} dk}{\\int_{k_{\\min}}^{k_c} k^{-\\gamma} dk} = \\frac{ \\frac{k_c^{3-\\gamma} - k_{\\min}^{3-\\gamma}}{3-\\gamma} }{ \\frac{k_c^{1-\\gamma} - k_{\\min}^{1-\\gamma}}{1-\\gamma} } $$\n\n**3. Solving for the Critical Cutoff $k_c$**\nSubstituting the moments into the threshold condition, the normalization constants cancel, leaving:\n$$ T \\frac{k_c^{3-\\gamma} - k_{\\min}^{3-\\gamma}}{3-\\gamma} = (1+T) \\frac{k_c^{2-\\gamma} - k_{\\min}^{2-\\gamma}}{2-\\gamma} $$\nWe are given $\\gamma = 2.5$, $k_{\\min} = 1$, and $T=0.2$. The equation becomes:\n$$ 0.2 \\frac{k_c^{0.5} - 1^{0.5}}{0.5} = (1+0.2) \\frac{k_c^{-0.5} - 1^{-0.5}}{-0.5} $$\n$$ 0.4 (k_c^{0.5} - 1) = -2.4 (k_c^{-0.5} - 1) $$\n$$ (k_c^{0.5} - 1) = -6 (k_c^{-0.5} - 1) = 6 (1 - k_c^{-0.5}) $$\nLet $x = k_c^{0.5}$.

Two established risk surrogates for sustained prevalence are: (i) in the quenched mean-field approximation, monotone dependence on the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix, denoted by $\\,\\lambda_{1}\\,$, and (ii) in the heterogeneous mean-field approximation, monotone dependence on the ratio $\\,\\langle k^{2}\\rangle/\\langle k\\rangle\\,$, where $\\,\\langle k\\rangle\\,$ and $\\,\\langle k^{2}\\rangle\\,$ are the first and second moments of the degree distribution, respectively.

            "solution": "The problem asks us to determine which of two immunization strategies, $\\mathrm{H}$ (hub-targeting) or $\\mathrm{M}$ (moderate-degree targeting), is superior based on a composite risk metric $\\Phi(\\alpha)$. The optimal strategy is the one that yields a lower risk value.\n\n**1. Define the Risk Functions**\nThe composite risk metric is a weighted average of two different risk surrogates:\n$$ \\Phi(\\alpha) = \\alpha\\,R_{\\mathrm{spec}} + (1-\\alpha)\\,R_{\\mathrm{mf}} $$\nWe are given the normalized post-intervention values for each strategy.\n\nFor Strategy $\\mathrm{H}$:\n$$ \\Phi^{(\\mathrm{H})}(\\alpha) = \\alpha(0.55) + (1-\\alpha)(0.70) = 0.55\\alpha + 0.70 - 0.70\\alpha = 0.70 - 0.15\\alpha $$\n\nFor Strategy $\\mathrm{M}$:\n$$ \\Phi^{(\\mathrm{M})}(\\alpha) = \\alpha(0.80) + (1-\\alpha)(0.50) = 0.80\\alpha + 0.50 - 0.50\\alpha = 0.50 + 0.30\\alpha $$\n\n**2. Find the Crossover Point**\nA crossover in the preferred strategy occurs at the value of $\\alpha$, denoted $\\alpha^{\\star}$, where the two risk functions are equal:\n$$ \\Phi^{(\\mathrm{H})}(\\alpha^{\\star}) = \\Phi^{(\\mathrm{M})}(\\alpha^{\\star}) $$\n$$ 0.70 - 0.15\\alpha^{\\star} = 0.50 + 0.30\\alpha^{\\star} $$\nWe solve for $\\alpha^{\\star}$:\n$$ 0.70 - 0.50 = 0.30\\alpha^{\\star} + 0.15\\alpha^{\\star} $$\n$$ 0.20 = 0.45\\alpha^{\\star} $$\n$$ \\alpha^{\\star} = \\frac{0.20}{0.45} = \\frac{20}{45} = \\frac{4}{9} \\approx 0.4444... $$\nA unique crossover point exists at $\\alpha^{\\star} \\approx 0.44$, which is within the valid range $[0, 1]$.\n\n**3. Determine the Optimal Strategy Regions**\nWe now determine which strategy is better on either side of $\\alpha^{\\star}$.\n\nStrategy $\\mathrm{H}$ is preferred when $\\Phi^{(\\mathrm{H})}(\\alpha)  \\Phi^{(\\mathrm{M})}(\\alpha)$:\n$$ 0.70 - 0.15\\alpha  0.50 + 0.30\\alpha $$\n$$ 0.20  0.45\\alpha $$\n$$ \\alpha > \\frac{0.20}{0.45} = \\frac{4}{9} $$\nThus, for $\\alpha > \\alpha^{\\star}$, Strategy $\\mathrm{H}$ is optimal.\n\nConversely, Strategy $\\mathrm{M}$ is preferred when $\\Phi^{(\\mathrm{M})}(\\alpha)  \\Phi^{(\\mathrm{H})}(\\alpha)$, which occurs when $\\alpha  \\alpha^{\\star}$.\n\n**4. Match with Options**\nThe result is:\n- A unique crossover point exists at $\\alpha^{\\star} \\approx 0.44$.\n- For $\\alpha > \\alpha^{\\star}$, strategy $\\mathrm{H}$ is better (minimizes risk).\n- For $\\alpha  \\alpha^{\\star}$, strategy $\\mathrm{M}$ is better (minimizes risk).\n\nThis exactly matches the description in option A.",
