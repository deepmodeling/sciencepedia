            "problem": "An industrial Cyber-Physical System (CPS) maintains a single logical plant model as a distributed Digital Twin (DT) replicated on $N$ edge-cloud nodes to support low-latency control and high availability. The orchestrator implements a quorum protocol under a pure crash-fault model: up to $f$ replicas may stop permanently, messages are eventually delivered when replicas are alive, there are no Byzantine behaviors, and storage is persistent at each replica. A write operation updates the DT state with a monotonically increasing version and commits only after receiving acknowledgments from a chosen write quorum of size $W$. A read operation returns the value with the highest version observed from a chosen read quorum of size $R$. The orchestrator requires safety in the sense of an atomic single-writer/multi-reader register: each read must return the value of the most recent completed write, even under concurrent operations and up to $f$ crash failures.\n\nFrom first principles, the orchestrator must ensure that reads see the last completed write and that two completed writes cannot both succeed without a common replica that stores the later version. At the same time, the orchestrator must ensure the ability to complete reads and writes when up to $f$ replicas have crashed.\n\nSelect all options that give sufficient, correct conditions on $R$, $W$, $N$, and $f$ to ensure both safety and availability under up to $f$ crash failures, and that correctly justify the minimal replica requirement for such a design.\n\nA. Choose $W$ and $R$ so that $W > \\frac{N}{2}$ and $R + W > N$. Under up to $f$ crashes, require $R \\le N - f$ and $W \\le N - f$, which implies $N \\ge 2f + 1$. With $N = 2f + 1$, the minimal safe choice is $R = W = f + 1$.\n\nB. Choose $R \\ge f + 1$ and $W \\ge f + 1$, and allow $N = 2f$ since at most $f$ failures still leave $f$ live replicas to satisfy both quorums. With $N = 2f$, a minimal choice is $R = W = f + 1$.\n\nC. Choose $R + W \\ge N$ and $W \\ge f$ with $N \\ge 2f$, allowing the minimal quorum sizes $R = f$ and $W = f$.\n\nD. Choose $R = 1$ and $W = f + 1$ with $N \\ge 2f + 1$, since any write reaches a strict majority and any single live replica suffices to serve a read under crash faults.\n\nE. Choose $R = N - f$ and $W = N - f$ with $N \\ge 2f + 1$ to ensure that any two quorums intersect and that both reads and writes remain available despite up to $f$ crashes.",
            "solution": "To ensure safety and availability for the distributed register under up to $f$ crash faults, we derive the necessary conditions on the quorum sizes $R$ and $W$ and the total number of replicas $N$.\n\n1.  **Safety (Consistency):** To guarantee that a read operation returns the most recent successfully written value (linearizability), the read quorum must overlap with the write quorum of that latest write. This prevents a read from missing the newest data. The mathematical condition for any read quorum (of size $R$) to intersect with any write quorum (of size $W$) is:\n    $$R + W > N$$\n    Additionally, to prevent two different write operations from completing concurrently on disjoint sets of replicas (a \"split-brain\" scenario), any two write quorums must intersect. This is expressed as:\n    $$W + W > N \\implies W > \\frac{N}{2}$$\n    This requires the write quorum to be a strict majority.\n\n2.  **Availability (Liveness):** The system must be able to complete read and write operations even when $f$ replicas have crashed. This means there must be enough remaining live replicas ($N-f$) to form a quorum.\n    -   For a write to succeed: $W \\le N - f$\n    -   For a read to succeed: $R \\le N - f$\n\n3.  **Minimal Replica Requirement:** We can combine these conditions to find the minimum number of replicas, $N$. From availability, we have $R \\le N-f$ and $W \\le N-f$. Summing these gives $R+W \\le 2(N-f)$. Combining with the safety condition $R+W > N$, we get:\n    $$N  R+W \\le 2N - 2f$$\n    Focusing on the inequality $N  2N - 2f$, we find $2f  N$. Since $N$ must be an integer, the minimal number of replicas is $N \\ge 2f + 1$.\n\nNow we evaluate the options based on these principles:\n\n-   **A:** This option correctly states all the derived conditions: $W > N/2$, $R+W > N$, availability constraints leading to $N \\ge 2f+1$. It also provides the correct minimal symmetric choice for $N=2f+1$, which is $R = W = f+1$. This choice satisfies all conditions. **This option is correct.**\n-   **B:** This option incorrectly proposes that $N=2f$ is sufficient. As shown by our derivation ($N > 2f$), this violates the conditions required to ensure both safety and availability simultaneously. For $N=2f$, it's impossible to form a quorum of size $f+1$ if $f$ nodes crash. **This option is incorrect.**\n-   **C:** This option uses a weak safety condition $R+W \\ge N$, which should be a strict inequality ($R+W > N$). If $R+W=N$, disjoint quorums are possible, violating safety. **This option is incorrect.**\n-   **D:** This choice, $R=1$ and $W=f+1$ with $N=2f+1$, fails the safety condition $R+W > N$. We get $1 + (f+1) > 2f+1 \\implies f+2 > 2f+1 \\implies 1 > f$. This only holds for $f=0$ (no faults), so it's not a general fault-tolerant solution. **This option is incorrect.**\n-   **E:** This option proposes $R = W = N-f$ with $N \\ge 2f+1$. This satisfies availability by construction. It also satisfies safety, because $R+W = 2(N-f) > N \\iff 2N-2f > N \\iff N > 2f$, which is guaranteed by $N \\ge 2f+1$. The write-write condition $W=N-f > N/2 \\iff N/2 > f \\iff N > 2f$ is also satisfied. **This option is correct.**",

The orchestrator samples raw latency at discrete times and computes a slot-averaged latency to reduce measurement noise before deciding.

Assume non-overlapping slots so that $\\{S_{j}\\}$ are independent across slots.\n- The orchestrator uses a hysteretic thresholding policy with two thresholds: an upper threshold $\\theta$ (in seconds) and a lower threshold $\\theta - h$ (in seconds), where $h > 0$ is the hysteresis band to be designed. Migration is triggered if a slot average satisfies $S_{j} \\geq \\theta$. De-migration (return) is permitted only if there are $d$ consecutive slot averages at or below the lower threshold, i.e., $S_{j}, S_{j+1}, \\dots, S_{j+d-1} \\leq \\theta - h$, where $d \\in \\mathbb{N}$ is a fixed consecutive-count requirement.\n\nTo prevent thrashing (rapid back-and-forth migrations caused purely by measurement fluctuations), the orchestrator must guarantee that, under the worst-case condition $\\ell = \\theta$, the probability that de-migration is erroneously triggered solely due to measurement noise within $d$ consecutive slots is at most $\\alpha$, where $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$ is a given risk budget.\n\nStarting from the above measurement and decision definitions, derive the smallest hysteresis band $h^{\\star}$ (in seconds) that ensures the probability of de-migration due to noise alone is less than or equal to $\\alpha$ when the true latency equals the upper threshold, and when slot averages are non-overlapping and independent across slots.\n\nExpress your final answer as a closed-form analytic expression for $h^{\\star}$ in terms of $\\sigma_{0}$, $w$, $\\alpha$, and $d$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the maximum number of identical assets, $k_{\\max}$, that can be concurrently hosted on a cluster with specified resource capacities and an operational headroom requirement. The solution is derived from first principles of resource additivity.\n\nFirst, we formulate the resource consumption model for a single replica of a service $i$. The resources under consideration are CPU cores ($c$), RAM ($m$), and network bandwidth ($b$). The total consumption for a single replica is based on its base usage, a multiplicative overhead factor, and an additive overhead.\n\nFor an **active** replica of service $i$, the base usages are $c_i$, $m_i$, and $b_i$. The multiplicative overhead factors are $(1+\\alpha_c)$, $(1+\\alpha_m)$, and $(1+\\alpha_b)$, and the additive overheads are $\\delta_c$, $\\delta_m$, and $\\delta_b$. The total resource consumption for one active replica of service $i$ is:\n-   CPU consumption: $c_{i, \\text{active}}^{\\text{total}} = c_i (1+\\alpha_c) + \\delta_c$\n-   RAM consumption: $m_{i, \\text{active}}^{\\text{total}} = m_i (1+\\alpha_m) + \\delta_m$\n-   Bandwidth consumption: $b_{i, \\text{active}}^{\\text{total}} = b_i (1+\\alpha_b) + \\delta_b$\n\nFor a **hot standby** replica of service $i$, the base usage is a fraction of the active replica's base usage, specified by factors $\\sigma_c$, $\\sigma_m$, and $\\sigma_b$. The problem states that the same overheads apply to all replicas.
