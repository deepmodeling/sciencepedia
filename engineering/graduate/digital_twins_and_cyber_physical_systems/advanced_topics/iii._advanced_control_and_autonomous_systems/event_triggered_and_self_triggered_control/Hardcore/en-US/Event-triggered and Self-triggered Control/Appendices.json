            "introduction": "A core design challenge in event-triggered control is the avoidance of Zeno behavior, a pathological scenario where an infinite number of triggering events occur in a finite time, rendering the system physically unrealizable. This exercise explores a classic example of how the dynamics of a finite-time convergent system can conspire with a naive relative-error trigger to produce this undesirable outcome. By working through this analysis , you will uncover the underlying mechanism of event accumulation and appreciate why robust trigger designs must often include safeguards like minimum inter-event times or hysteresis.",

An event generator is defined by the naive static relative-error trigger without any hysteresis or dynamic filtering: given an event time $t_k$ and the held sample $x(t_k)$, the next event time $t_{k+1}  t_k$ is the first instant at which the absolute measurement error meets the relative threshold condition $|x(t_k) - x(t)| = \\sigma |x(t)|$, where $\\sigma \\in (0,1)$ is fixed and time is measured in seconds.

The event-triggering rule is a classic relative error threshold. The concept of Zeno behavior is a fundamental topic in the study of hybrid and event-triggered systems. The problem is firmly grounded in control theory and dynamical systems.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is unambiguous. It provides all necessary information—the system dynamics, initial condition, and a precisely defined event-generation rule—to uniquely determine the sequence of event times and analyze its limiting behavior.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using formal mathematical language, free of subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\nVerdict: The problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically sound question in the domain of event-triggered control theory. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from first principles as required.\n\nFirst, we must find the solution to the dynamics $\\dot{x}(t) = -\\sqrt{x(t)}$ for an arbitrary initial condition $x(t_k) = x_k$. This is a separable ordinary differential equation. For $x(t)  0$, we can write:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{x}} = -dt $$\nWe integrate both sides from the time of the $k$-th event, $t_k$, to a subsequent time $t  t_k$:\n$$ \\int_{x(t_k)}^{x(t)} \\frac{d\\xi}{\\sqrt{\\xi}} = \\int_{t_k}^{t} (-1) d\\tau $$\nEvaluating the integrals yields:\n$$ \\left[ 2\\sqrt{\\xi} \\right]_{x_k}^{x(t)} = -[\\tau]_{t_k}^{t} $$\n$$ 2\\sqrt{x(t)} - 2\\sqrt{x_k} = -(t - t_k) $$\nRearranging for $\\sqrt{x(t)}$ gives the solution for the state trajectory between events:\n$$ \\sqrt{x(t)} = \\sqrt{x_k} - \\frac{1}{2}(t - t_k) $$\nSquaring both sides gives the explicit form of the state evolution:\n$$ x(t) = \\left( \\sqrt{x_k} - \\frac{1}{2}(t - t_k) \\right)^2 $$\nThis solution is valid for $t \\ge t_k$ as long as the term in the parenthesis is non-negative. Since $\\dot{x}  0$ for $x  0$, the state $x(t)$ is monotonically decreasing for $t  t_k$, thus $x(t)  x_k$.\n\nNext, we analyze the event-triggering condition: $|x(t_k) - x(t)| = \\sigma|x(t)|$.\nSince $x(t)$ is decreasing and non-negative, for $t \\in (t_k, t_{k+1}]$, we have $x(t_k) - x(t)  0$ and $x(t)  0$. The condition simplifies to:\n$$ x_k - x(t) = \\sigma x(t) $$\nThe next event at time $t_{k+1}$ is the first instant $t  t_k$ where this equality holds. Let $x_{k+1} = x(t_{k+1})$. The condition at $t=t_{k+1}$ is:\n$$ x_k = (1 + \\sigma) x_{k+1} $$\nThis yields a recursive relationship for the state values at consecutive event times:\n$$ x_{k+1} = \\frac{x_k}{1 + \\sigma} $$\nThis is a geometric progression. Unfolding the recursion from the initial state $x_0 = x(0)$ gives the state at the $k$-th event:\n$$ x_k = x_0 \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\sigma} \\right)^k $$\n\nNow, we determine the inter-event time $\\Delta t_k = t_{k+1} - t_k$. We use the state trajectory solution, evaluated at $t = t_{k+1}$:\n$$ \\sqrt{x_{k+1}} = \\sqrt{x_k} - \\frac{1}{2}(t_{k+1} - t_k) $$\nSubstituting the relationships $\\sqrt{x_{k+1}} = \\sqrt{x_k / (1+\\sigma)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{x_k}}{\\sqrt{1+\\sigma}}$ and $\\Delta t_k = t_{k+1} - t_k$:\n$$ \\frac{\\sqrt{x_k}}{\\sqrt{1+\\sigma}} = \\sqrt{x_k} - \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta t_k $$\nWe solve for $\\Delta t_k$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta t_k = \\sqrt{x_k} - \\frac{\\sqrt{x_k}}{\\sqrt{1+\\sigma}} = \\sqrt{x_k} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+\\sigma}} \\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta t_k = 2\\sqrt{x_k} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+\\sigma}} \\right) $$\nTo determine if Zeno behavior occurs, we must sum all inter-event times. The accumulation time $T_Z$ is the limit of the sequence of event times, which is the sum of the infinite series of inter-event times:\n$$ T_Z = \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} t_N = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\Delta t_k $$\nSubstitute the expression for $x_k$ into the equation for $\\Delta t_k$:\n$$ \\sqrt{x_k} = \\sqrt{x_0 \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\sigma} \\right)^k} = \\sqrt{x_0} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+\\sigma}} \\right)^k $$\nThus, the $k$-th inter-event time is:\n$$ \\Delta t_k = 2\\sqrt{x_0} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+\\sigma}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+\\sigma}} \\right)^k $$\nThe sum is a geometric series of the form $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} a r^k$ with first term $a = \\Delta t_0 = 2\\sqrt{x_0} (1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+\\sigma}})$ and common ratio $r = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+\\sigma}}$. Since $\\sigma \\in (0,1)$, we have $1  \\sqrt{1+\\sigma}  \\sqrt{2}$, which implies $0  r  1$. The series therefore converges to a finite value. This confirms the existence of Zeno behavior.\n\nThe sum of the geometric series is given by $\\frac{a}{1-r}$. We compute $T_Z$:\n$$ T_Z = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\Delta t_k = \\frac{2\\sqrt{x_0} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+\\sigma}} \\right)}{1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+\\sigma}}} $$\nThe term $(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+\\sigma}})$ appears in both the numerator and the denominator, and since $\\sigma  0$, this term is non-zero. They cancel.\n$$ T_Z = 2\\sqrt{x_0} $$\nThe Zeno accumulation time is $2\\sqrt{x_0}$ seconds. It is notable that the result is independent of the triggering parameter $\\sigma$.\n\nThe mechanism by which events accumulate is intrinsic to the plant dynamics. The system $\\dot{x} = -\\sqrt{x}$ exhibits finite-time convergence to the equilibrium $x=0$. For the uncontrolled system starting from $x_0$, the time to reach $x=0$ is found by setting $x(t)=0$ in the solution $x(t) = (\\sqrt{x_0} - \\frac{1}{2}t)^2$, which gives $t = 2\\sqrt{x_0}$. This is precisely the Zeno time $T_Z$ we calculated. The event generator forces an infinite number of samples to be taken as the state approaches the origin. The inter-event times $\\Delta t_k$ are proportional to $\\sqrt{x_k}$, and since $x_k \\to 0$ as $k \\to \\infty$, the inter-event times shrink to zero. The infinite sum of these shrinking intervals converges to the finite time it takes the system to reach the origin, at which point the sampling frequency must become infinite to maintain a constant relative error for a state value of zero, which is an impossibility. This accumulation is a direct consequence of combining a finite-time stable system with a static relative error-based trigger.",

It uses established principles of Lyapunov stability for systems with bounded disturbances and state-dependent uncertainties. It is entirely scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed.

The setup is theoretically feasible and relevant.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A full derivation of the solution is warranted.\n\n### Derivation\nThe objective is to find the ultimate bound for the state norm $\\|x(t)\\|$. We begin by substituting the control law into the plant dynamics to obtain the closed-loop system dynamics.\nThe control law is $u(t) = K (x(t) + e(t))$. Substituting this into the state equation gives:\n$$ \\dot{x}(t) = A x(t) + B \\left( K (x(t) + e(t)) \\right) + d(t) $$\n$$ \\dot{x}(t) = A x(t) + B K x(t) + B K e(t) + d(t) $$\n$$ \\dot{x}(t) = (A + B K) x(t) + B K e(t) + d(t) $$\nThis equation describes the evolution of the system state under the event-triggered control law and in the presence of the disturbance.\n\nTo analyze the stability and boundedness of the state, we use the quadratic Lyapunov function candidate $V(x) = x^{\\top} P x$, where $P$ is the symmetric positive-definite matrix from the given Lyapunov equation. The time derivative of $V(x(t))$ along the trajectories of the system is:\n$$ \\dot{V}(x) = \\frac{d}{dt} (x^{\\top} P x) = \\dot{x}^{\\top} P x + x^{\\top} P \\dot{x} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\dot{x}(t)$:\n$$ \\dot{V}(x) = \\left( (A + B K)x + B K e + d \\right)^{\\top} P x + x^{\\top} P \\left( (A + B K)x + B K e + d \\right) $$\nExpanding the terms yields:\n$$ \\dot{V}(x) = x^{\\top}(A + B K)^{\\top} P x + (B K e)^{\\top} P x + d^{\\top} P x + x^{\\top} P (A + B K)x + x^{\\top} P (B K e) + x^{\\top} P d $$\nGrouping terms and using the fact that for a scalar $a$, $a = a^{\\top}$:\n$$ \\dot{V}(x) = x^{\\top} \\left( (A + B K)^{\\top} P + P (A + B K) \\right) x + 2 x^{\\top} P B K e + 2 x^{\\top} P d $$\nWe are given the Lyapunov equation $(A + B K)^{\\top} P + P (A + B K) = -Q$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\dot{V}(x)$:\n$$ \\dot{V}(x) = -x^{\\top} Q x + 2 x^{\\top} P B K e + 2 x^{\\top} P d $$\nTo find a condition for convergence to a bounded set, we find an upper bound for $\\dot{V}(x)$. We use norm inequalities to bound the terms involving $e(t)$ and $d(t)$.\nThe first term is bounded below using the minimum eigenvalue of $Q$:\n$$ -x^{\\top} Q x \\le - \\lambda_{\\min}(Q) \\|x\\|^2 $$\nThe second term is bounded using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, the properties of induced matrix norms, and the given bound on the error $e(t)$:\n$$ |2 x^{\\top} P B K e(t)| \\le 2 \\|x\\| \\|P B K\\| \\|e(t)\\| \\le 2 \\|x\\| \\|P B K\\| (\\mu \\|x\\|) = 2 \\mu \\|P B K\\| \\|x\\|^2 $$\nThe third term is bounded similarly, using the given bound on the disturbance $d(t)$:\n$$ |2 x^{\\top} P d(t)| \\le 2 \\|x^{\\top} P\\| \\|d(t)\\| = 2 \\|(P x)^{\\top}\\| \\|d(t)\\| = 2 \\|P x\\| \\|d(t)\\| \\le 2 \\|P\\| \\|x\\| \\|d(t)\\| \\le 2 \\|P\\| \\bar{d} \\|x\\| $$\nCombining these inequalities, we obtain an upper bound for $\\dot{V}(x)$:\n$$ \\dot{V}(x) \\le - \\lambda_{\\min}(Q) \\|x\\|^2 + 2 \\mu \\|P B K\\| \\|x\\|^2 + 2 \\|P\\| \\bar{d} \\|x\\| $$\n$$ \\dot{V}(x) \\le - \\left( \\lambda_{\\min}(Q) - 2 \\mu \\|P B K\\| \\right) \\|x\\|^2 + 2 \\|P\\| \\bar{d} \\|x\\| $$\nFor the system state to be ultimately bounded, the trajectories must eventually be confined to a region where $\\dot{V}(x)$ is non-positive. This requires that $\\dot{V}(x)$ becomes negative for sufficiently large $\\|x\\|$. The quadratic term in $\\|x\\|$ dominates for large $\\|x\\|$, so its coefficient must be negative. This imposes a regularity condition on the parameter $\\mu$:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\min}(Q) - 2 \\mu \\|P B K\\|  0 \\implies \\mu  \\frac{\\lambda_{\\min}(Q)}{2 \\|P B K\\|} $$\nAssuming this condition holds, let $\\gamma = \\lambda_{\\min}(Q) - 2 \\mu \\|P B K\\|  0$. The inequality for $\\dot{V}(x)$ becomes:\n$$ \\dot{V}(x) \\le - \\gamma \\|x\\|^2 + 2 \\|P\\| \\bar{d} \\|x\\| $$\nThe derivative $\\dot{V}(x)$ is guaranteed to be negative if $-\\gamma \\|x\\|^2 + 2 \\|P\\| \\bar{d} \\|x\\|  0$. For $\\|x\\|  0$, this is equivalent to:\n$$ - \\gamma \\|x\\| + 2 \\|P\\| \\bar{d}  0 $$\n$$ \\|x\\|  \\frac{2 \\|P\\| \\bar{d}}{\\gamma} $$\nThis inequality defines the region outside of which all trajectories converge inwards. Therefore, the state $x(t)$ is guaranteed to eventually enter and remain within the ball defined by this bound. The ultimate bound on the norm of the state is the value at which this boundary is reached.\n\nSubstituting back the expression for $\\gamma$, the ultimate bound is:\n$$ \\|x(t)\\| \\le \\frac{2 \\|P\\| \\bar{d}}{\\lambda_{\\min}(Q) - 2 \\mu \\|P B K\\|} $$\nfor all sufficiently large $t$. This is the tightest ultimate bound that can be derived using the provided Lyapunov function and standard norm-bounding techniques. The expression is given in terms of the specified parameters.",
