The core of the monitor is the logic that decides when to switch away from the advanced controller to guarantee safety. This practice will guide you through the concrete calculations involved in making this switching decision for a linear system with a polyhedral safety set, giving you hands-on experience with implementing predictive safety checks and computing minimal-norm corrective actions .",

            "problem": "Consider a continuous-time linear dynamical system in a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) with state $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and control input $u \\in \\mathbb{R}$ governed by $\\dot{x} = A x + B u$. The safety set is the polyhedron $S = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} : C x \\le d \\}$, where $C \\in \\mathbb{R}^{4 \\times 2}$ and $d \\in \\mathbb{R}^{4}$ encode facet normals and bounds. A Runtime Assurance (RA) Simplex monitor uses a digital twin model for predictive assessment. To guard against model mismatch and actuation delay, the monitor tightens the admissible derivative set by requiring $C (A x + B u) \\le d'$, where $d' = d - m$ and $m \\in \\mathbb{R}^{4}$ is a known positive margin vector. The Simplex architecture selects an advanced controller $u_{a}(x)$ when safety can be certified and switches to a baseline controller $u_{b}(x)$ otherwise. The baseline controller is defined by the minimal-norm corrective action $u_{b}$ that solves $\\min \\| u \\|$ subject to $C (A x + B u) \\le d'$.\n\nStarting from the forward-invariance definition for polyhedral safety sets (requiring that the directional derivative along each facet normal does not point outward on or near the boundary), the monitor performs a one-step lookahead check using the tightened constraint $C (A x + B u) \\le d'$ evaluated at the current state $x$ and the advanced control $u_{a}(x)$. If any component violates the tightened bound, the monitor switches to the baseline controller.\n\nLet the system matrices and safety set be\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 \\\\\n-2 & -\\tfrac{1}{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\nB = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 \\\\\n1\n\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\nC = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n-1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & -1\n\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\nd = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n1 \\\\\n1 \\\\\n1\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThus $S = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} : |x_{1}| \\le 1, \\, |x_{2}| \\le 1 \\}$. Suppose the known margin is\n$$\nm = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0.2 \\\\\n0.2 \\\\\n0.2 \\\\\n0.2\n\\end{pmatrix},\n$$\nso that $d' = d - m = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.8 \\\\ 0.8 \\\\ 0.8 \\\\ 0.8 \\end{pmatrix}$. The advanced controller is\n$$\nu_{a}(x) = -3 x_{1} - x_{2},\n$$\nand the current state is\n$$\nx = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0.95 \\\\\n0.2\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n\nUsing the invariance-based tightening $C (A x + B u) \\le d'$ and the minimal-norm baseline formulation, determine the Simplex monitor’s switching decision $s \\in \\{0,1\\}$, where $s = 1$ denotes a switch to the baseline controller and $s = 0$ denotes remaining with the advanced controller. Additionally, compute the corresponding minimal-norm baseline input $u_{b}$ that satisfies $C (A x + B u_{b}) \\le d'$.\n\nExpress your final answer as a row matrix containing $s$ and $u_{b}$ in that order.

            "solution": "### Part 1: Derivation of the CBF Inequality Constraint\n\nThe CBF constraint is given by the inequality:\n$$\nL_{f}h(x) + L_{g}h(x)\\,u + \\alpha\\!\\left(h(x)\\right) \\ge 0\n$$\nTo make this inequality explicit, we must compute the Lie derivatives of $h(x)$ with respect to $f(x)$ and $g(x)$. The Lie derivative of a scalar function $h$ with respect to a vector field $v$ is $L_{v}h(x) = \\nabla h(x) \\cdot v(x) = (\\nabla h(x))^{T} v(x)$.\n\nGiven the CBF $h(x) = x_{1} - p_{\\min}$, its gradient with respect to $x = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{bmatrix}$ is:\n$$\n\\nabla h(x) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x_{1}} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x_{2}} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we compute the Lie derivatives using the given $f(x)$ and $g(x)$:\n$$\nL_{f}h(x) = (\\nabla h(x))^{T} f(x) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x_{2} \\\\ -\\lambda\\,x_{1} \\end{bmatrix} = 1 \\cdot x_{2} + 0 \\cdot (-\\lambda\\,x_{1}) = x_{2}\n$$\n$$\nL_{g}h(x) = (\\nabla h(x))^{T} g(x) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} = 1 \\cdot 1 + 0 \\cdot 0 = 1\n$$\nWe are also given $\\alpha(s) = \\gamma s$, so $\\alpha(h(x)) = \\gamma h(x) = \\gamma(x_{1} - p_{\\min})$.\n\nSubstituting these components back into the CBF inequality yields:\n$$\nx_{2} + (1)u + \\gamma(x_{1} - p_{\\min}) \\ge 0\n$$\nThis is the explicit inequality constraint on the control input $u$ at a state $x$.\n\n### Part 2: Explicit Quadratic Program Formulation\n\nThe runtime assurance monitor solves the QP:\n$$\nu^{\\star}(x) \\;=\\; \\arg\\min_{u \\in \\mathbb{R}} \\;\\|u - u_{n}(x)\\|^{2}\n$$\nsubject to the CBF constraint and actuator bounds $u \\in U = [u_{\\min}, u_{\\max}]$. For a scalar control $u$, minimizing $\\|u - u_{n}(x)\\|^{2}$ is equivalent to minimizing $(u - u_{n}(x))^{2}$.\n\nThe constraints are:\n1. The CBF constraint derived in Part 1: $x_{2} + u + \\gamma(x_{1} - p_{\\min}) \\ge 0$.\n2. The actuator (box) constraints: $u_{\\min} \\le u \\le u_{\\max}$.\n\nWe can rewrite the CBF constraint to isolate $u$:\n$$\nu \\ge -x_{2} - \\gamma(x_{1} - p_{\\min})\n$$\nThe complete QP, expressed as a scalar optimization problem with linear inequality and box constraints, is therefore:\n$$\n\\text{minimize} \\quad (u - u_{n}(x))^{2} \\\\\n\\text{subject to} \\quad u \\ge -x_{2} - \\gamma x_{1} + \\gamma p_{\\min} \\\\\n\\qquad \\qquad u_{\\min} \\le u \\le u_{\\max}\n$$\nThis formulation is in terms of the state $x=\\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{bmatrix}$, parameters $\\gamma$ and $p_{\\min}$, the nominal control $u_n(x)$, and the control bounds $u_{\\min}$, $u_{\\max}$.\n\n### Part 3: Numerical Solution of the QP\n\nWe are given the following numerical values:\n- State: $x = \\begin{bmatrix} -0.05 \\\\ -0.02 \\end{bmatrix}$, so $x_{1} = -0.05$ and $x_{2} = -0.02$.\n- Parameters: $p_{\\min} = 0$ and $\\gamma = 4$.\n- Control bounds: $U = [-0.10,\\, 0.25]$, so $u_{\\min} = -0.10$ and $u_{\\max} = 0.25$.\n- Nominal control: $u_{n}(x) = 0.30$.\n\nFirst, we determine the feasible set for $u$ by substituting these values into the constraints.\n\nThe CBF constraint is:\n$$\nu \\ge -x_{2} - \\gamma x_{1} + \\gamma p_{\\min} \\\\\nu \\ge -(-0.02) - (4)(-0.05) + (4)(0) \\\\\nu \\ge 0.02 + 0.20 \\\\\nu \\ge 0.22\n$$\nThe actuator constraints are:\n$$\n-0.10 \\le u \\le 0.25\n$$\nThe feasible set for $u$ is the intersection of these constraints: $u$ must satisfy both $u \\ge 0.22$ and $-0.10 \\le u \\le 0.25$. The intersection is the closed interval $[0.22, 0.25]$.\n\nThe optimization problem is to find the value of $u$ in the interval $[0.22, 0.25]$ that minimizes the objective function $(u - 0.30)^{2}$. This is equivalent to finding the point in the interval $[0.22, 0.25]$ that is closest to the nominal control value $u_{n} = 0.30$.\n\nThe unconstrained minimizer of the objective function is at $u = 0.30$. This value lies outside the feasible interval $[0.22, 0.25]$. The objective function is a parabola opening upwards, so its value increases as we move away from the minimum at $u=0.30$. Therefore, the minimum over the interval must occur at the boundary point closest to $0.30$.\n\nThe two boundary points are $0.22$ and $0.25$.\n- The distance to the left boundary is $|0.22 - 0.30| = |-0.08| = 0.08$.\n- The distance to the right boundary is $|0.25 - 0.30| = |-0.05| = 0.05$.\n\nThe right boundary, $u=0.25$, is closer to the nominal control $u_{n} = 0.30$. Thus, the solution to the QP, which is the minimally invasive safe control, is:\n$$\nu^{\\star}(x) = 0.25\n$$\nThis value is a terminating decimal, which is an exact rational number.",
