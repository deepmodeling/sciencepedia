The steady-state concentration of this protein is the key output of their mathematical model. To understand the system's behavior, they perform a Morris screening, which is a method for Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA). This method calculates two sensitivity indices for each model parameter:\n1.  $\\mu^*$ (mu-star), which represents the mean of the absolute values of the \"elementary effects\" for a parameter. This index measures the overall or \"main\" effect of a parameter on the model output. A higher $\\mu^*$ indicates greater influence.\n2.  $\\sigma$ (sigma), which represents the standard deviation of the elementary effects. This index measures the extent of non-linear effects or interactions the parameter has with other parameters. A higher $\\sigma$ suggests a more complex influence.\n\nThe team has analyzed five key parameters of their model and obtained the following sensitivity indices:\n\n*   **Parameter $p_1$ (Promoter Strength):** $\\mu^* = 0.12$, $\\sigma = 0.15$\n*   **Parameter $p_2$ (Ribosome Binding Site Strength):** $\\mu^* = 1.85$, $\\sigma = 0.25$\n*   **Parameter $p_3$ (Protein Degradation Rate):** $\\mu^* = 0.95$, $\\sigma = 0.30$\n*   **Parameter $p_4$ (Allosteric Inhibition Constant):** $\\mu^* = 1.60$, $\\sigma = 2.10$\n*   **Parameter $p_5$ (mRNA Half-life):** $\\mu^* = 0.08$, $\\sigma = 0.07$\n\nBased on this analysis, which parameter has an influence on the protein concentration that is both strong and characterized by a high degree of non-linearity or interaction with other parameters?\n\nA. $p_1$\n\nB. $p_2$\n\nC. $p_3$\n\nD. $p_4$\n\nE. $p_5$",

Ranking by $\\mu^{*}$ gives $p_{2}$ largest, then $p_{4}$, then $p_{3}$, with $p_{1}$ and $p_{5}$ much smaller. Ranking by $\\sigma$ gives $p_{4}$ overwhelmingly largest, with the others $p_{3}$, $p_{2}$, $p_{1}$, and $p_{5}$ all comparatively small.\n\nTo satisfy both criteria simultaneously, we require a parameter with large $\\mu^{*}$ and large $\\sigma$. Parameter $p_{2}$, while having the largest $\\mu^{*}$, has a relatively small $\\sigma=0.25$, indicating weak nonlinearity or interactions.

            "solution": "The problem is solved in two parts as requested. First, the exact analytic expression for $\\mathrm{Var}(Y)$ is derived. Second, a qualitative explanation of variance-based Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) for the given model is provided.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of $\\mathrm{Var}(Y)$**\n\nThe model output is given by the equation $Y = X_{1}^{2} + X_{2}$. The inputs $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ are independent random variables, both distributed uniformly on the interval $[0, 1]$.\n$X_{1} \\sim \\mathrm{Unif}(0,1)$\n$X_{2} \\sim \\mathrm{Unif}(0,1)$\n\nThe probability density function (PDF) for a random variable $X \\sim \\mathrm{Unif}(0,1)$ is:\n$$f(x) = \\begin{cases} 1  \\text{for } 0 \\le x \\le 1 \\\\ 0  \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$$\n\nThe variance of $Y$, denoted $\\mathrm{Var}(Y)$, can be computed using the property of variances for sums of independent random variables. Because $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ are independent, any function of $X_{1}$ (such as $X_{1}^{2}$) is also independent of any function of $X_{2}$ (such as $X_{2}$ itself). Therefore, the random variables $X_{1}^{2}$ and $X_{2}$ are independent.\n\nFor two independent random variables $A$ and $B$, the variance of their sum is the sum of their variances: $\\mathrm{Var}(A + B) = \\mathrm{Var}(A) + \\mathrm{Var}(B)$.\nApplying this to our model:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(Y) = \\mathrm{Var}(X_{1}^{2} + X_{2}) = \\mathrm{Var}(X_{1}^{2}) + \\mathrm{Var}(X_{2})$$\n\nWe will now compute each term separately using the fundamental definition of variance, $\\mathrm{Var}(Z) = E[Z^2] - (E[Z])^2$, where $E[\\cdot]$ denotes the expectation operator.\n\nFirst, we compute $\\mathrm{Var}(X_{2})$.\nThe expectation of $X_{2}$ is:\n$$E[X_{2}] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x_{2} f(x_{2}) \\,dx_{2} = \\int_{0}^{1} x_{2} \\cdot 1 \\,dx_{2} = \\left[ \\frac{x_{2}^{2}}{2} \\right]_{0}^{1} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThe expectation of $X_{2}^{2}$ is:\n$$E[X_{2}^{2}] = \\int_{0}^{1} x_{2}^{2} \\cdot 1 \\,dx_{2} = \\left[ \\frac{x_{2}^{3}}{3} \\right]_{0}^{1} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nThe variance of $X_{2}$ is therefore:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(X_{2}) = E[X_{2}^{2}] - (E[X_{2}])^{2} = \\frac{1}{3} - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{4-3}{12} = \\frac{1}{12}$$\n\nNext, we compute $\\mathrm{Var}(X_{1}^{2})$. Let the random variable $Z = X_{1}^{2}$. We need to compute $\\mathrm{Var}(Z) = E[Z^2] - (E[Z])^2 = E[(X_1^2)^2] - (E[X_1^2])^2 = E[X_1^4] - (E[X_1^2])^2$.\nThe expectation of $X_{1}^{2}$ is:\n$$E[X_{1}^{2}] = \\int_{0}^{1} x_{1}^{2} \\cdot 1 \\,dx_{1} = \\left[ \\frac{x_{1}^{3}}{3} \\right]_{0}^{1} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nThe expectation of $X_{1}^{4}$ is:\n$$E[X_{1}^{4}] = \\int_{0}^{1} x_{1}^{4} \\cdot 1 \\,dx_{1} = \\left[ \\frac{x_{1}^{5}}{5} \\right]_{0}^{1} = \\frac{1}{5}$$\nThe variance of $X_{1}^{2}$ is therefore:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(X_{1}^{2}) = E[X_{1}^{4}] - (E[X_{1}^{2}])^{2} = \\frac{1}{5} - \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{9-5}{45} = \\frac{4}{45}$$\n\nFinally, we sum the two variances to find $\\mathrm{Var}(Y)$:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(Y) = \\mathrm{Var}(X_{1}^{2}) + \\mathrm{Var}(X_{2}) = \\frac{4}{45} + \\frac{1}{12}$$\nTo sum these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is the least common multiple of $45$ and $12$. $45 = 3^2 \\cdot 5$ and $12 = 2^2 \\cdot 3$. The LCM is $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 = 4 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 5 = 180$.\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(Y) = \\frac{4 \\cdot 4}{45 \\cdot 4} + \\frac{1 \\cdot 15}{12 \\cdot 15} = \\frac{16}{180} + \\frac{15}{180} = \\frac{31}{180}$$\n\n**Part 2: Qualitative Explanation of Variance-Based GSA**\n\nThe foundational principle of variance-based Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA), often known as the Sobol method, is the decomposition of the total variance of the model output, $\\mathrm{Var}(Y)$, into contributions from each input factor and their interactions. For a model $Y=f(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_k)$, the decomposition is:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(Y) = \\sum_{i} V_i + \\sum_{ij} V_{ij} + \\dots + V_{12...k}$$\nwhere $V_i = \\mathrm{Var}_{X_i}(E_{X_{\\sim i}}[Y | X_i])$ is the first-order effect of $X_i$ (variance of the conditional expectation), and $V_{ij}$ and higher-order terms represent interaction effects. The first-order sensitivity index is $S_i = V_i / \\mathrm{Var}(Y)$.\n\nIn the specific problem $Y = X_{1}^{2} + X_{2}$, the model is additive in functions of the inputs, i.e., $Y = f_1(X_1) + f_2(X_2)$ where $f_1(X_1) = X_1^2$ and $f_2(X_2) = X_2$. For a purely additive model with independent inputs, all interaction effects are zero ($V_{12}=0$). The variance decomposition simplifies to:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(Y) = V_1 + V_2 = \\mathrm{Var}(f_1(X_1)) + \\mathrm{Var}(f_2(X_2)) = \\mathrm{Var}(X_{1}^{2}) + \\mathrm{Var}(X_{2})$$\nThis confirms that our calculation in Part 1 is consistent with the GSA framework. The variance is additively composed of the variance contributed by the nonlinear term $X_1^2$ and the linear term $X_2$.\n\nQualitatively, GSA attributes sensitivity as follows:\n1.  **Nonlinearity in $X_1$**: The output $Y$ depends on $X_1$ via the nonlinear (quadratic) function $X_1^2$. GSA does not rely on local derivatives. Instead, it correctly quantifies the overall contribution of $X_1$'s uncertainty to the output's variance across its entire range of variation. The \"main effect\" of $X_1$ is captured by $\\mathrm{Var}(X_1^2) = 4/45$. This demonstrates that GSA is capable of handling nonlinear input-output relationships directly.\n2.  **Linearity in $X_2$**: The output $Y$ depends linearly on $X_2$. The main effect of $X_2$ is simply its own variance, $\\mathrm{Var}(X_2) = 1/12$. GSA quantifies this contribution straightforwardly.\n3.  **Decomposition**: The analysis shows that the total output variance $\\mathrm{Var}(Y) = 31/180$ is partitioned between the two inputs. The first-order sensitivity indices are $S_1 = V_1/\\mathrm{Var}(Y) = (4/45)/(31/180) = 16/31$ and $S_2 = V_2/\\mathrm{Var}(Y) = (1/12)/(31/180) = 15/31$. This shows that the two inputs contribute almost equally to the output variance ($S_1 \\approx 51.6\\%$, $S_2 \\approx 48.4\\%$), despite the different functional forms (nonlinear vs. linear) of their influence.\n\nThis decomposition is well suited for nonlinear models in Digital Twins of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) for several critical reasons:\n- **Captures Nonlinearity and Interactions**: CPS models are typically highly nonlinear and may exhibit strong interactions between parameters. Unlike local sensitivity methods (e.g., based on partial derivatives), GSA provides a comprehensive picture of how input uncertainties affect the output over their entire probability distributions, fully accounting for nonlinearities and interactions.\n- **Factor Prioritization**: By quantifying each input's contribution to output uncertainty, GSA allows engineers to identify the most critical sources of variability. This is essential for robust design, guiding efforts to either tighten tolerances on influential components (e.g., $X_1$) or implement control strategies to mitigate the effects of external disturbances (e.g., $X_2$).\n- **Model Reduction and Validation**: In complex Digital Twins with thousands of parameters, GSA can identify non-influential parameters ($S_i \\approx 0$), which can then be fixed at their nominal values, simplifying the model without significant loss of accuracy. This is crucial for creating computationally tractable digital twins.\n\nIn summary, GSA's ability to provide a full, quantitative decomposition of output variance in the presence of nonlinearities makes it an indispensable tool for understanding and managing uncertainty in the complex models that form the core of Digital Twins for CPS.",

The first-order Sobol index for factor $X_j$ is defined as $S_j = \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X_j]\\right) / \\operatorname{Var}(Y)$, and the total-order Sobol index for $X_j$ is defined as $T_j = 1 - \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid \\mathbf{X}_{-j}]\\right) / \\operatorname{Var}(Y)$, where $\\mathbf{X}_{-j}$ denotes all inputs except $X_j$.

            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of the computational cost of Saltelli's sampling scheme for global sensitivity analysis. The total number of model evaluations is determined by the structure and dimensions of the sample matrices used in the procedure. The derivation proceeds in three stages: first, formalizing the sampling plan as described; second, deriving a general formula for the number of model runs as a function of the base sample size $N$ and the number of input dimensions $d$; and third, verifying the formula for the boundary case of $d=0$.\n\nThe sampling plan for estimating all first-order $S_j$ and total-order $T_j$ Sobol indices is constructed using three types of matrices. The model $Y=f(\\mathbf{X})$ must be evaluated for each row of these matrices.\n\n$1$. **Base Sample Matrices**: The plan begins with two independent sample matrices, $A$ and $B$. Both are of size $N \\times d$, where $N$ is the base sample size and $d$ is the number of input factors. Each matrix is generated by sampling $N \\times d$ points from the independent distributions of the input factors (e.g., uniform on $[0,1]$).\n-   Matrix $A$ has $N$ rows. Evaluating the model for each row of $A$ requires $N$ model runs.\n-   Matrix $B$ also has $N$ rows. Evaluating the model for each row of $B$ requires an additional $N$ model runs.\n\n$2$. **Mixed Sample Matrices**: For each input factor $X_j$ where $j \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, d\\}$, a \"mixed\" matrix $A^{(j)}_B$ is constructed. This matrix is identical to matrix $A$, except its $j$-th column is replaced by the $j$-th column from matrix $B$.\n-   There are $d$ input factors, so $d$ such matrices are constructed: $A^{(1)}_B, A^{(2)}_B, \\ldots, A^{(d)}_B$.\n-   Each matrix $A^{(j)}_B$ is of size $N \\times d$ and thus has $N$ rows.\n-   Evaluating the model for the rows of all these $d$ matrices requires $d \\times N$ model runs.\n\nThe total number of model runs is the sum of the runs required for each of these matrices. Assuming the rows of all constructed matrices are unique (which is true with probability $1$ for continuous sampling distributions), there is no overlap in the required evaluations.\n\nThe total number of runs, which we denote by $N_{total}$, is the sum of runs from matrix $A$, matrix $B$, and the $d$ mixed matrices $A^{(j)}_B$.\n$$N_{total} = (\\text{runs for } A) + (\\text{runs for } B) + (\\text{runs for all } A^{(j)}_B)$$\n$$N_{total} = N + N + \\sum_{j=1}^{d} N$$\n$$N_{total} = 2N + dN$$\n$$N_{total} = N(d+2)$$\nThis formula gives the total number of model executions for $d \\geq 1$.\n\nThe problem requires special consideration for the boundary case where $d=0$. In this scenario, the model $Y=f()$ has no input factors. Let us apply the described sampling plan algorithmically:\n-   The base matrices $A$ and $B$ are of size $N \\times d$, which becomes $N \\times 0$. Each matrix consists of $N$ rows, where each row is an empty vector representing a single point in the zero-dimensional input space. Evaluating the model for matrix $A$ requires $N$ runs, and for matrix $B$ requires another $N$ runs.\n-   The construction of mixed matrices $A^{(j)}_B$ is specified for each input factor $j \\in \\{1, \\ldots, d\\}$. When $d=0$, this set of indices is empty. Consequently, no mixed matrices are constructed.\n-   The total number of runs for $d=0$ is therefore the sum of runs for $A$ and $B$, which is $N + N = 2N$.\n\nIt is essential to check if our general formula $N_{total} = N(d+2)$ is consistent with this result. Substituting $d=0$ into the formula yields:\n$$N_{total} = N(0+2) = 2N$$\nThe formula holds for the boundary case $d=0$, providing a logically consistent expression for all non-negative integer values of $d$.\n\nTherefore, for a given base sample size $N$ and number of input factors $d$, the total number of model evaluations required by Saltelli's scheme is $N(d+2)$.",
