This exercise explores the fundamental concept of observability, which determines if a system's internal state can be uniquely reconstructed from its external outputs. By analyzing how the removal of a sensor impacts the rank of the observability matrix, you will gain a concrete understanding of structural resilience and learn to identify which sensor sets are critical for monitoring a cyber-physical system against both faults and attacks.",

The plant evolves with the state update law $x_{k+1} = a x_k$, and the sensor reports $y_k = c x_k + a_k$, where $a_k$ denotes an adversarial additive sensor attack. A standard Luenberger observer is used in the digital twin: $\\hat{x}_{k+1} = a \\hat{x}_k + L\\left(y_k - c \\hat{x}_k\\right)$. Let the system matrices be $a = 1.2$ and $c = 1$.

            "solution": "The problem is divided into two parts. First, we must determine the observer gain $L$ that satisfies a given Lyapunov inequality while minimizing its own magnitude. Second, we must use this gain to calculate the worst-case amplification of a sensor attack, which is defined as the induced $\\ell_{\\infty}$-gain from the attack sequence $a_k$ to the estimation error $e_k$.\n\n**Part 1: Design of the Observer Gain $L$**\n\nThe problem provides the state-space model for a scalar discrete-time system and a Luenberger observer. The estimation error dynamics are given by:\n$$e_{k+1} = (a - L c) e_k - L a_k$$\nwhere $e_k = x_k - \\hat{x}_k$ is the estimation error, $a_k$ is the adversarial attack, and $L$ is the observer gain to be designed.\n\nWe are tasked with finding $L$ such that the discrete-time Lyapunov inequality is satisfied for the autonomous part of the error dynamics, $e_{k+1} = (a-Lc)e_k$. The inequality is:\n$$(a - L c)^{\\top} P (a - L c) - \\rho^2 P \\preceq 0$$\nThe given parameters are $a = 1.2$, $c = 1$, the desired decay rate $\\rho = 0.6$, and the Lyapunov matrix (a scalar in this case) $P = 1$.\n\nSince all variables are scalars, the transpose operation is identity, and the matrix inequality $\\preceq 0$ becomes a standard scalar inequality $\\le 0$. Substituting the given values into the inequality, we get:\n$$(1.2 - L \\cdot 1) \\cdot 1 \\cdot (1.2 - L \\cdot 1) - (0.6)^2 \\cdot 1 \\le 0$$\n$$(1.2 - L)^2 - 0.36 \\le 0$$\nThis is a quadratic inequality in terms of the variable $L$. We can rearrange it as:\n$$(1.2 - L)^2 \\le 0.36$$\nTaking the square root of both sides, we obtain:\n$$|1.2 - L| \\le \\sqrt{0.36}$$\n$$|1.2 - L| \\le 0.6$$\nThis absolute value inequality is equivalent to the following compound inequality:\n$$-0.6 \\le 1.2 - L \\le 0.6$$\nWe solve this for $L$. First, for the left side:\n$$-0.6 \\le 1.2 - L \\implies L \\le 1.2 + 0.6 \\implies L \\le 1.8$$\nSecond, for the right side:\n$$1.2 - L \\le 0.6 \\implies 1.2 - 0.6 \\le L \\implies 0.6 \\le L$$\nCombining these two results, the set of all gains $L$ that satisfy the Lyapunov inequality is the closed interval $[0.6, 1.8]$.\n\nThe problem asks us to select the gain $L$ from this set that minimizes its absolute value, $|L|$. Since all values in the interval $[0.6, 1.8]$ are positive, the minimum of $|L|$ corresponds to the minimum value of $L$ in the interval.\nTherefore, the optimal observer gain is $L=0.6$.\n\n**Part 2: Quantification of Worst-Case Attack Amplification**\n\nNow, we use the determined gain $L=0.6$ to find the induced $\\ell_{\\infty}$-gain, denoted by $\\gamma$, from the attack input $a_k$ to the error state $e_k$. The gain $\\gamma$ is the smallest number such that for any bounded attack sequence with $\\sup_k |a_k| \\le 1$, the error is bounded by $\\sup_k |e_k| \\le \\gamma$.\n\nThe error dynamics are given by:\n$$e_{k+1} = (a - L c) e_k - L a_k$$\nLet's define the system matrix for the error dynamics as $A_e = a - L c$ and the input matrix as $B_e = -L$. Substituting the values $a=1.2$, $c=1$, and $L=0.6$:\n$$A_e = 1.2 - 0.6 \\cdot 1 = 0.6$$\n$$B_e = -0.6$$\nSo, the error system is described by the first-order difference equation:\n$$e_{k+1} = 0.6 e_k - 0.6 a_k$$\n\nFor a linear time-invariant (LTI) system, the induced $\\ell_{\\infty}$-gain from input to output is equal to the $\\ell_1$-norm of the system's impulse response. Let $h_k$ denote the impulse response from the input $a_k$ to the output $e_k$. The sequence $h_k$ is the response $e_k$ to a unit impulse input $a_k = \\delta_k$ (where $\\delta_0 = 1$ and $\\delta_k = 0$ for $k \\ne 0$), assuming an initial state of $e_0 = 0$.\n\nThe transfer function from the input $a_k$ to the state $e_k$ is needed. Let's analyze the system $e_{k+1} = A_e e_k + B_e a_k$. The output is $y'_k=e_k$.\nThe impulse response sequence $h_k = e_k$ for an input $a_k = \\delta_k$ is:\n- for $k=0$: $e_0 = 0$ (initial condition), so $h_0=0$.\n- for $k=1$: $e_1 = A_e e_0 + B_e a_0 = A_e \\cdot 0 + B_e \\cdot 1 = B_e$. So $h_1 = B_e$.\n- for $k=2$: $e_2 = A_e e_1 + B_e a_1 = A_e (B_e) + B_e \\cdot 0 = A_e B_e$. So $h_2 = A_e B_e$.\n- for $k  2$: $e_k = A_e e_{k-1} = A_e^{k-1} B_e$. So $h_k = A_e^{k-1} B_e$.\n\nThe impulse response is given by $h_k = A_e^{k-1} B_e$ for $k \\ge 1$ and $h_0 = 0$.\nThe $\\ell_{\\infty}$-gain $\\gamma$ is the $\\ell_1$-norm of this sequence:\n$$\\gamma = \\|h\\|_1 = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} |h_k| = |h_0| + \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} |h_k| = 0 + \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} |A_e^{k-1} B_e|$$\n$$\\gamma = |B_e| \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} |A_e|^{k-1}$$\nLet $j=k-1$. The sum becomes a geometric series:\n$$\\gamma = |B_e| \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} |A_e|^j$$\nThe Lyapunov analysis guaranteed that $|A_e| = |a-Lc| \\le \\rho = 0.6  1$, so the series converges.\nThe sum of the geometric series is $\\frac{1}{1 - |A_e|}$.\nThus, the gain is:\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{|B_e|}{1 - |A_e|}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values $A_e = 0.6$ and $B_e = -0.6$:\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{|-0.6|}{1 - |0.6|} = \\frac{0.6}{1 - 0.6} = \\frac{0.6}{0.4}$$\n$$\\gamma = 1.5$$\nThe worst-case amplification factor from the sensor attack to the estimation error is $1.5$.",

We assume no process or measurement noise.\n\nLet us derive the dynamics of the estimation error.\nThe prediction error propagates as:\n$$e_{k\\mid k-1} = x_k - \\hat{x}_{k\\mid k-1} = a\\,x_{k-1} - a\\,\\hat{x}_{k-1\\mid k-1} = a(x_{k-1} - \\hat{x}_{k-1\\mid k-1}) = a\\,e_{k-1\\mid k-1}$$\nThe estimation error evolves according to:\n$$e_{k\\mid k} = x_k - \\hat{x}_{k\\mid k} = x_k - (\\hat{x}_{k\\mid k-1} + k\\,r_k) = e_{k\\mid k-1} - k\\,r_k$$\nThe residual $r_k$ can be expressed in terms of the prediction error and the attack signal:\n$$r_k = y_k - c\\,\\hat{x}_{k\\mid k-1} = (c\\,x_k + a_k) - c\\,\\hat{x}_{k\\mid k-1} = c(x_k - \\hat{x}_{k\\mid k-1}) + a_k = c\\,e_{k\\mid k-1} + a_k$$\nSubstituting the expression for $r_k$ into the equation for $e_{k\\mid k}$:\n$$e_{k\\mid k} = e_{k\\mid k-1} - k(c\\,e_{k\\mid k-1} + a_k) = (1 - ck)e_{k\\mid k-1} - k\\,a_k$$\nCombining with the propagation of the prediction error, we obtain a single recurrence for the estimation error:\n$$e_{k\\mid k} = a(1 - ck)e_{k-1\\mid k-1} - k\\,a_k$$\nWe now use this framework to find the required expressions for the two-step attack horizon, $k=1,2$.\n\nFor $k=1$:\nThe prediction error is $e_{1\\mid 0} = a\\,e_{0\\mid 0} = a \\cdot 0 = 0$.\nThe residual $r_1$ is:\n$$r_1 = c\\,e_{1\\mid 0} + a_1 = c \\cdot 0 + a_1 = a_1$$\nThe estimation error $e_{1\\mid 1}$ is:\n$$e_{1\\mid 1} = (1 - ck)e_{1\\mid 0} - k\\,a_1 = (1-ck) \\cdot 0 - k\\,a_1 = -k\\,a_1$$\n\nFor $k=2$:\nThe prediction error is $e_{2\\mid 1} = a\\,e_{1\\mid 1} = a(-k\\,a_1) = -ak\\,a_1$.\nThe residual $r_2$ is:\n$$r_2 = c\\,e_{2\\mid 1} + a_2 = c(-ak\\,a_1) + a_2 = a_2 - ack\\,a_1$$\nThe estimation error $e_{2\\mid 2}$ is:\n$$e_{2\\mid 2} = (1 - ck)e_{2\\mid 1} - k\\,a_2 = (1 - ck)(-ak\\,a_1) - k\\,a_2 = -ak(1 - ck)a_1 - k\\,a_2$$\nThis can be written as $e_{2\\mid 2} = ak(ck - 1)a_1 - k\\,a_2$.\n\nSummary of derived expressions:\n1. $r_1 = a_1$\n2. $r_2 = a_2 - ack\\,a_1$\n3. $e_{2\\mid 2} = ak(ck - 1)a_1 - k\\,a_2$\n\nPart 2: Formulation and solution of the constrained optimization problem.\n\nWe substitute the given parameters $a = 1$, $c = 1$, $k = \\frac{1}{2}$, $\\gamma = 0.25$, and $\\delta = 0.20$ into the derived expressions.\nThe expressions for the residuals and the final error become:\n$r_1 = a_1$\n$r_2 = a_2 - (1)(1)(\\frac{1}{2})a_1 = a_2 - \\frac{1}{2}a_1$\n$e_{2\\mid 2} = (1)(\\frac{1}{2})((1)(\\frac{1}{2}) - 1)a_1 - \\frac{1}{2}a_2 = \\frac{1}{2}(-\\frac{1}{2})a_1 - \\frac{1}{2}a_2 = -\\frac{1}{4}a_1 - \\frac{1}{2}a_2$\n\nThe optimization problem is to find $(a_1, a_2)$ that solves:\n$$ \\min_{a_1,a_2} \\; J(a_1, a_2) = a_1^2 + a_2^2 $$\nsubject to the constraints:\n1. $|r_1| \\leq \\gamma \\implies |a_1| \\leq 0.25$\n2. $|r_2| \\leq \\gamma \\implies |a_2 - \\frac{1}{2}a_1| \\leq 0.25$\n3. $e_{2\\mid 2} = \\delta \\implies -\\frac{1}{4}a_1 - \\frac{1}{2}a_2 = 0.20$\n\nThe objective function $J(a_1, a_2)$ is the squared Euclidean distance of the attack vector $(a_1, a_2)$ from the origin. The problem is to find the point on the feasible set that is closest to the origin.\nFirst, we analyze the equality constraint, which defines a line in the $(a_1, a_2)$ plane:\n$$-\\frac{1}{4}a_1 - \\frac{1}{2}a_2 = 0.20 \\implies -a_1 - 2a_2 = 0.80 \\implies a_1 + 2a_2 = -0.80$$\nTo find the point on this line with the minimum norm (closest to the origin), we can project the origin onto the line. The vector from the origin to this point must be parallel to the line's normal vector, $\\mathbf{n} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. Thus, the solution $(a_1, a_2)$ must be of the form $(\\lambda, 2\\lambda)$ for some scalar $\\lambda$. Substituting this into the line equation:\n$$ \\lambda + 2(2\\lambda) = -0.80 \\implies 5\\lambda = -0.80 \\implies \\lambda = -0.16 $$\nThis gives the unconstrained minimum point on the line:\n$$ (a_1^*, a_2^*) = (-0.16, -0.32) $$\nNow, we must verify if this point satisfies the stealthiness inequality constraints:\n1. $|a_1^*| = |-0.16| = 0.16$. Since $0.16 \\leq 0.25$, this constraint is satisfied.\n2. We check the residual $r_2$: $r_2^* = a_2^* - \\frac{1}{2}a_1^* = -0.32 - \\frac{1}{2}(-0.16) = -0.32 + 0.08 = -0.24$.\n   The constraint is $|r_2^*| = |-0.24| = 0.24$. Since $0.24 \\leq 0.25$, this constraint is also satisfied.\n\nSince the point on the line $e_{2\\mid 2}=\\delta$ closest to the origin also satisfies a priori the stealthiness constraints, it is the solution to the constrained optimization problem.\nThe optimal minimal-energy stealthy attack sequence is $(a_1, a_2) = (-0.16, -0.32)$.\n\nPart 3: Calculation of minimal attack energy and interpretation.\n\nThe minimal attack energy is the value of the objective function $J = a_1^2 + a_2^2$ at the optimal point:\n$$ E_{\\min} = (-0.16)^2 + (-0.32)^2 = 0.0256 + 0.1024 = 0.128 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the minimal attack energy is $0.1280$.\n\nInterpretation: The solution reveals the attacker's optimal strategy for biasing the state estimate while evading detection. To achieve the target bias $\\delta = 0.20$ with minimum energy, the attacker must inject a sequence of small, coordinated measurement corruptions. The first injection $a_1 = -0.16$ is fully exposed in the residual $r_1$ but is small enough to remain below the detection threshold $\\gamma=0.25$. This initial attack corrupts the filter's state estimate $\\hat{x}_{1\\mid 1}$. The filter's own dynamics then propagate this error, creating a vulnerability at the next step. The second injection $a_2 = -0.32$ is chosen to partially cancel the propagated error in the residual $r_2 = -0.24$, keeping it just under the threshold, while compounding the error in the final state estimate $e_{2\\mid 2}$ to the desired value $\\delta$. This demonstrates that an attacker can exploit the filter's memory to distribute the impact of an attack over time, making it much harder to detect than a single, large-magnitude attack. The fact that the optimal residuals, $|r_1|=0.16$ and $|r_2|=0.24$, are close to the threshold $\\gamma=0.25$ indicates that the system is being stressed close to its detection capability to achieve the desired bias.",
