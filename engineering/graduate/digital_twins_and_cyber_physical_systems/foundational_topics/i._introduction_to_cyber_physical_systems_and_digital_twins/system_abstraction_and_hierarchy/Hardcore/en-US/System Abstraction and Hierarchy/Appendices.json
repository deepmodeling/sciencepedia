            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of two different discrete-time abstractions of a continuous-time system and the quantification of the one-step error between them over a specified operating set.\n\nFirst, we must derive the exact discrete-time model, $x_{k+1} = \\Phi x_k + \\Gamma u_k$. The continuous-time dynamics are given by the linear time-invariant (LTI) ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\dot{x}(t) = a x(t) + b u(t)\n$$\nThe solution to this equation, starting from an initial condition $x(t_0)$, is given by the variation of constants formula:\n$$\nx(t) = \\exp(a(t-t_0)) x(t_0) + \\int_{t_0}^{t} \\exp(a(t-\\tau)) b u(\\tau) \\, d\\tau\n$$\nWe are interested in the evolution of the state from time $t_0 = k h$ to $t = (k+1) h$. Let $x_k \\triangleq x(kh)$. The state at the next sampling instant is $x_{k+1} \\triangleq x((k+1)h)$:\n$$\nx_{k+1} = \\exp(a((k+1)h - kh)) x_k + \\int_{kh}^{(k+1)h} \\exp(a((k+1)h - \\tau)) b u(\\tau) \\, d\\tau\n$$\nThe problem states that a Zero-Order Hold (ZOH) is used, meaning the control input is held constant over each sampling interval: $u(\\tau) = u_k$ for $\\tau \\in [kh, (k+1)h)$. Substituting this into the integral and simplifying the exponential term gives:\n$$\nx_{k+1} = \\exp(ah) x_k + b u_k \\int_{kh}^{(k+1)h} \\exp(a((k+1)h - \\tau)) \\, d\\tau\n$$\nTo evaluate the integral, we perform a change of variable. Let $s = (k+1)h - \\tau$. Then $ds = -d\\tau$. The limits of integration change from $\\tau=kh$ to $s=h$, and from $\\tau=(k+1)h$ to $s=0$.\n$$\n\\int_{kh}^{(k+1)h} \\exp(a((k+1)h - \\tau)) \\, d\\tau = \\int_{h}^{0} \\exp(as) (-ds) = \\int_{0}^{h} \\exp(as) \\, ds\n$$\nSince $a = -1 \\neq 0$, the integral evaluates to:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{h} \\exp(as) \\, ds = \\left[ \\frac{\\exp(as)}{a} \\right]_0^h = \\frac{\\exp(ah) - \\exp(0)}{a} = \\frac{\\exp(ah) - 1}{a}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $x_{k+1}$:\n$$\nx_{k+1} = \\exp(ah) x_k + b \\left( \\frac{\\exp(ah) - 1}{a} \\right) u_k\n$$\nBy comparing this to the given form $x_{k+1} = \\Phi x_k + \\Gamma u_k$, we identify the exact discrete-time system matrices:\n$$\n\\Phi = \\exp(ah) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\Gamma = \\frac{b}{a}(\\exp(ah) - 1)\n$$\n\nNext, we formulate the approximate abstraction using the forward Euler method. The forward Euler discretization of $\\dot{x} = f(x,u)$ is $x_{k+1} \\approx x_k + h f(x_k, u_k)$. For our system, $f(x,u) = ax+bu$, so the approximation is:\n$$\nx_{k+1}^{\\mathrm{E}} = x_k + h(a x_k + b u_k) = (1+ah)x_k + (bh)u_k\n$$\nThis gives the approximate system matrices $\\Phi^{\\mathrm{E}} = 1+ah$ and $\\Gamma^{\\mathrm{E}} = bh$.\n\nNow, we must quantify the one-step abstraction error, defined as $x_{k+1} - x_{k+1}^{\\mathrm{E}}$.\n$$\nx_{k+1} - x_{k+1}^{\\mathrm{E}} = (\\Phi x_k + \\Gamma u_k) - (\\Phi^{\\mathrm{E}} x_k + \\Gamma^{\\mathrm{E}} u_k)\n$$\n$$\nx_{k+1} - x_{k+1}^{\\mathrm{E}} = (\\Phi - \\Phi^{\\mathrm{E}}) x_k + (\\Gamma - \\Gamma^{\\mathrm{E}}) u_k\n$$\nLet's compute the difference terms:\n$$\n\\Phi - \\Phi^{\\mathrm{E}} = \\exp(ah) - (1+ah)\n$$\n$$\n\\Gamma - \\Gamma^{\\mathrm{E}} = \\frac{b}{a}(\\exp(ah) - 1) - bh = \\frac{b}{a}(\\exp(ah) - 1 - ah)\n$$\nThe error expression becomes:\n$$\nx_{k+1} - x_{k+1}^{\\mathrm{E}} = (\\exp(ah) - 1 - ah) x_k + \\frac{b}{a}(\\exp(ah) - 1 - ah) u_k\n$$\nWe can factor out the common term:\n$$\nx_{k+1} - x_{k+1}^{\\mathrm{E}} = (\\exp(ah) - 1 - ah) \\left( x_k + \\frac{b}{a} u_k \\right)\n$$\nWe are asked to compute $E^\\star$, the supremum of the absolute value of this error over the set $\\{(x_k, u_k) : |x_k| \\leq 1, |u_k| \\leq 1\\}$:\n$$\nE^\\star = \\sup_{\\substack{|x_k| \\leq 1 \\\\ |u_k| \\leq 1}} \\left| (\\exp(ah) - 1 - ah) \\left( x_k + \\frac{b}{a} u_k \\right) \\right|\n$$\nThis can be separated into two parts:\n$$\nE^\\star = \\left| \\exp(ah) - 1 - ah \\right| \\cdot \\sup_{\\substack{|x_k| \\leq 1 \\\\ |u_k| \\leq 1}} \\left| x_k + \\frac{b}{a} u_k \\right|\n$$\nLet's analyze the first term. The function $f(y) = \\exp(y) - 1 - y$ is a convex function with a global minimum at $y=0$, where $f(0)=0$. For any $y \\neq 0$, $f(y) > 0$. Since $a \\neq 0$ and $h > 0$, $ah \\neq 0$, so $\\exp(ah) - 1 - ah > 0$. Thus, the absolute value is redundant.\n\nFor the second term, we need to find the supremum of $|x_k + \\frac{b}{a} u_k|$ for $|x_k| \\leq 1$ and $|u_k| \\leq 1$. By the triangle inequality:\n$$\n\\left| x_k + \\frac{b}{a} u_k \\right| \\leq |x_k| + \\left| \\frac{b}{a} u_k \\right| = |x_k| + \\left| \\frac{b}{a} \\right| |u_k|\n$$\nSince $|x_k| \\leq 1$ and $|u_k| \\leq 1$, the maximum value of the right-hand side is $1 + |b/a|$. This maximum is attainable by choosing $|x_k|=1$, $|u_k|=1$, and ensuring that $x_k$ and $(b/a)u_k$ have the same sign. For example, if $b/a  0$, we can choose $x_k=1$ and $u_k=-1$ to get $|1 - b/a| = 1 - b/a = 1 + |b/a|$. Thus, the supremum is indeed $1 + |b/a|$.\n\nCombining these results, the expression for the maximum error is:\n$$\nE^\\star = (\\exp(ah) - 1 - ah) \\left( 1 + \\left| \\frac{b}{a} \\right| \\right)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $a=-1$, $b=2$, and $h=0.1$.\n$$\nah = (-1)(0.1) = -0.1\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2}{-1} = -2\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $E^\\star$:\n$$\nE^\\star = (\\exp(-0.1) - 1 - (-0.1)) \\left( 1 + |-2| \\right)\n$$\n$$\nE^\\star = (\\exp(-0.1) - 0.9) (1 + 2)\n$$\n$$\nE^\\star = 3 (\\exp(-0.1) - 0.9)\n$$\nNow we compute the numerical value.\n$$\n\\exp(-0.1) \\approx 0.9048374180\n$$\n$$\nE^\\star \\approx 3 (0.9048374180 - 0.9)\n$$\n$$\nE^\\star \\approx 3 (0.0048374180)\n$$\n$$\nE^\\star \\approx 0.014512254\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the result to six significant figures. The first six significant digits are $1, 4, 5, 1, 2, 2$. The seventh significant digit is $5$, so we round up the sixth digit.\n$$\nE^\\star \\approx 0.0145123\n$$",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a uniform worst-case error bound $E$ for the piecewise linear interpolation of the function $f(x) = \\sin(x)$ over the domain $[-\\pi, \\pi]$. The domain is partitioned into three intervals of equal length.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the error of linear interpolation is a standard result from calculus. For a function $f(x)$ that is twice differentiable, the error $e(x) = f(x) - p_1(x)$, where $p_1(x)$ is the linear polynomial interpolating $f(x)$ at points $a$ and $b$, is given by:\n$$e(x) = \\frac{f''(\\xi)}{2!} (x-a)(x-b)$$\nfor some $\\xi \\in (a, b)$.\n\nA standard, widely-used upper bound is obtained by separating the terms:\n$$\\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |f(x) - p_1(x)| \\leq \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\sup_{t \\in [a,b]} |f''(t)| \\right) \\left( \\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |(x-a)(x-b)| \\right)$$\nThe term $(x-a)(x-b)$ describes a parabola whose maximum absolute value on the interval $[a,b]$ occurs at the midpoint $x = \\frac{a+b}{2}$. Let $h = b-a$ be the length of the interval. At the midpoint, this maximum value is $\\frac{h^2}{4}$. Substituting this back into the error bound formula gives the standard bound for linear interpolation on an interval of length $h$:\n$$\\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |e(x)| \\leq \\frac{h^2}{8} \\sup_{t \\in [a,b]} |f''(t)|$$\nThis is the \"well-tested interpolation error fact\" the problem alludes to.\n\nIn this problem, $f(x) = \\sin(x)$. Its derivatives are $f'(x) = \\cos(x)$ and $f''(x) = -\\sin(x)$. Therefore, $|f''(x)| = |-\\sin(x)| = |\\sin(x)|$.\n\nThe domain $[-\\pi, \\pi]$ is partitioned into three intervals of equal length $h$:\n$I_0 = [-\\pi, -\\frac{\\pi}{3}]$, $I_1 = [-\\frac{\\pi}{3}, \\frac{\\pi}{3}]$, and $I_2 = [\\frac{\\pi}{3}, \\pi]$.\nThe length of each interval is $h = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$.\nThus, the term $\\frac{h^2}{8}$ is constant for all intervals:\n$$\\frac{h^2}{8} = \\frac{1}{8}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{8}\\left(\\frac{4\\pi^2}{9}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi^2}{18}$$\n\nThe uniform error bound $E$ over the entire domain $[-\\pi, \\pi]$ is the maximum of the error bounds from each sub-interval.

For $I_1 = [-\\frac{\\pi}{3}, \\frac{\\pi}{3}]$: The function $|\\sin(t)|$ is symmetric about $t=0$. It increases from $0$ at $t=0$ to a maximum value at the endpoints.\n    $$ \\sup_{t \\in [-\\pi/3, \\pi/3]} |\\sin(t)| = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} $$\n    The error bound on this interval is $E_1 \\leq \\frac{\\pi^2}{18} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}\\pi^2}{36}$.\n\n3.  For $I_2 = [\\frac{\\pi}{3}, \\pi]$: This interval is symmetric to $I_0$ about the origin.

According to the problem's definition, this means the property $x+y \\ge c$ must hold for every concrete state in the concretization of every reachable abstract state.\nAs determined above, the set of reachable abstract states is $\\{b_1\\}$. Thus, we need to find the greatest $c$ such that for all $(x,y) \\in \\gamma(b_1)$, the inequality $x+y \\ge c$ holds.\nThis is equivalent to finding the greatest lower bound (infimum) of the function $f(x,y) = x+y$ over the domain $D = \\{(x,y) \\mid x \\ge 0 \\wedge y \\ge 0\\}$.\nThe function $f(x,y)$ is linear. Over the first quadrant of the Cartesian plane (including the axes), its minimum value occurs at the origin.\nFor any $(x,y)$ in this domain, since $x \\ge 0$ and $y \\ge 0$, their sum $x+y$ must also be greater than or equal to $0$.\nThe minimum value is $0$, which is achieved at the point $(x,y)=(0,0)$.\nSo, $\\inf\\{x+y \\mid x \\ge 0 \\wedge y \\ge 0\\} = 0$.\nThe strongest condition of the form $x+y \\ge c$ that holds for all states in $\\gamma(b_1)$ is $x+y \\ge 0$.\nTherefore, the greatest value of $c$ is $0$.",
