            "solution": "The problem presents two independent tasks concerning the stability analysis of a continuous-time Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system, which models elements of a Digital Twin for a Cyber-Physical System. The solution will address each task sequentially, adhering to the specified requirement of reasoning from first principles.\n\n### Task 1: Eigenvalue Computation and Stability Analysis of the Internal Model\n\nThe first task is to compute the eigenvalues of the state matrix $A$ and interpret their stability implications for the open-loop internal model. The state matrix is given as:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0  1  0 \\\\\n-7  -6  0 \\\\\n0  0  -4\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues of a matrix $A$ are, by definition, the roots of its characteristic polynomial, $p(\\lambda) = \\det(\\lambda I - A)$, where $I$ is the identity matrix and $\\lambda$ represents the eigenvalue variable.\n\nFirst, we construct the matrix $\\lambda I - A$:\n$$\n\\lambda I - A = \\lambda \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0 \\\\ 0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  0 \\\\ -7  -6  0 \\\\ 0  0  -4 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda  -1  0 \\\\ 7  \\lambda+6  0 \\\\ 0  0  \\lambda+4 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we compute the determinant of this matrix to find the characteristic polynomial $p(\\lambda)$. We can use cofactor expansion. Expansion along the third row is most efficient due to the two zero entries:\n$$\np(\\lambda) = \\det(\\lambda I - A) = (0) \\cdot C_{31} - (0) \\cdot C_{32} + (\\lambda+4) \\cdot C_{33}\n$$\nwhere $C_{ij}$ denotes the corresponding cofactor. The only non-zero term is:\n$$\np(\\lambda) = (\\lambda+4) \\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda  -1 \\\\ 7  \\lambda+6 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe $2 \\times 2$ determinant is calculated as:\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda  -1 \\\\ 7  \\lambda+6 \\end{pmatrix} = \\lambda(\\lambda+6) - (-1)(7) = \\lambda^{2} + 6\\lambda + 7\n$$\nThus, the characteristic polynomial is:\n$$\np(\\lambda) = (\\lambda+4)(\\lambda^{2} + 6\\lambda + 7)\n$$\nThe eigenvalues are the roots of $p(\\lambda) = 0$. This gives us two factors to solve:\n1. $\\lambda+4 = 0 \\implies \\lambda_1 = -4$\n2. $\\lambda^{2} + 6\\lambda + 7 = 0$\n\nTo find the roots of the quadratic factor, we use the quadratic formula, $\\lambda = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with $a=1$, $b=6$, and $c=7$:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{6^2 - 4(1)(7)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 - 28}}{2} = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{8}}{2} = \\frac{-6 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3 \\pm \\sqrt{2}\n$$\nThis gives the other two eigenvalues:\n$\\lambda_2 = -3 + \\sqrt{2}$\n$\\lambda_3 = -3 - \\sqrt{2}$\n\nSo, the three eigenvalues of the matrix $A$ are $\\lambda_1 = -4$, $\\lambda_2 = -3 + \\sqrt{2}$, and $\\lambda_3 = -3 - \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nFor the stability interpretation, a continuous-time LTI system $\\dot{x}=Ax$ is asymptotically stable if and only if all eigenvalues of the matrix $A$ lie strictly in the open left-half of the complex plane, which means that the real part of every eigenvalue must be strictly negative, i.e., $\\text{Re}(\\lambda_i)  0$ for all $i$. Let's check this condition for our eigenvalues:\n- $\\lambda_1 = -4$: This is a real number, so $\\text{Re}(\\lambda_1) = -4  0$.\n- $\\lambda_2 = -3 + \\sqrt{2}$: This is a real number. Since $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414$, we have $\\lambda_2 \\approx -3 + 1.414 = -1.586$. Clearly, $-3 + \\sqrt{2}  0$ because $3  \\sqrt{2}$ (or $9  2$). Thus, $\\text{Re}(\\lambda_2)  0$.\n- $\\lambda_3 = -3 - \\sqrt{2}$: This is a real number and is strictly negative. Thus, $\\text{Re}(\\lambda_3)  0$.\n\nSince all three eigenvalues have strictly negative real parts, the open-loop internal model described by the state matrix $A$ is asymptotically stable. Each eigenvalue corresponds to a system mode, and because all eigenvalues are in the left-half plane, all internal modes of the system will decay to zero over time if the system is unforced.\n\n### Task 2: Routh-Hurwitz Stability Analysis of the Loop Transfer Function\n\nThe second task is to determine the range of the positive gain parameter $k$ for which the closed-loop system, characterized by the denominator polynomial $a(s) = s^{3} + 6 s^{2} + 5 s + k$, is internally stable. Internal stability for a proper rational transfer function requires that all its poles, which are the roots of the denominator polynomial $a(s)$, lie strictly in the open left-half complex plane.\n\nThe Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion provides a method to determine if all roots of a polynomial have negative real parts without computing them directly. The criterion is applied to the polynomial $a(s) = s^{3} + 6 s^{2} + 5 s + k$.\n\nFirst, a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for stability is that all coefficients of the polynomial must be non-zero and have the same sign. Since the coefficient of $s^3$ is $1  0$, all other coefficients must be positive.\n- Coefficient of $s^2$: $6  0$\n- Coefficient of $s^1$: $5  0$\n- Coefficient of $s^0$: $k$. For stability, we must have $k  0$. This is consistent with the problem statement that $k$ is a positive control gain.\n\nThe necessary and sufficient condition is that all elements in the first column of the Routh array must be positive. We construct the Routh array for $a(s) = 1s^{3} + 6s^{2} + 5s + k$:\n\nThe first two rows are formed by the coefficients of the polynomial:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cc}\ns^3  1  5 \\\\\ns^2  6  k \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe subsequent rows are calculated as follows. The first element of the $s^1$ row, let's call it $b_1$, is:\n$$\nb_1 = \\frac{(6)(5) - (1)(k)}{6} = \\frac{30 - k}{6}\n$$\nThe first element of the $s^0$ row, let's call it $c_1$, is:\n$$\nc_1 = \\frac{(b_1)(k) - (6)(0)}{b_1} = k\n$$\nThe complete Routh array is:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cc}\ns^3  1  5 \\\\\ns^2  6  k \\\\\ns^1  \\frac{30 - k}{6}  0 \\\\\ns^0  k  0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\nFor the system to be stable, all elements in the first column must be positive:\n1. $1  0$ (This is true).\n2. $6  0$ (This is true).\n3. $\\frac{30 - k}{6}  0 \\implies 30 - k  0 \\implies k  30$.\n4. $k  0$ (This is the element from the $s^0$ row, consistent with the necessary condition).\n\nCombining the conditions on $k$, we find that the system is stable if and only if $0  k  30$.\n\nThe problem asks for the largest real number $K$ such that for all $k$ with $0  k  K$, the loop is internally stable. This corresponds to the supremum of the interval of stability for $k$. The interval of stability is $(0, 30)$. The supremum of this interval is $30$.\nTherefore, the value of $K$ is $30$.",

The solution is given by $x_h(t) = e^{At} x(0)$, where $e^{At}$ is the state-transition matrix. The corresponding output is $y_h(t) = C x_h(t) = C e^{At} x(0)$.\n\nTo compute the matrix exponential $e^{At}$, we decompose the matrix $A$ into simpler components. Let $A = -I + N$, where $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix and $N = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix}$. Since the identity matrix $I$ commutes with any matrix, we can write $e^{At} = e^{(-I+N)t} = e^{-It}e^{Nt}$.\n\nThe matrix $e^{-It}$ is simply $e^{-t}I = \\begin{pmatrix} e^{-t}  0 \\\\ 0  e^{-t} \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe matrix $N$ is nilpotent, as $N^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix}$.

It has two parts. The first part, $C x_f(t)$, represents the dynamic response, where the input excites the system's internal states which then evolve over time and contribute to the output. The second part, $D u(t)$, is the feedthrough term, representing an instantaneous, non-dynamic path from input to output. In the context of the actuator-sensor loop, this means the output is a combination of the system's dynamic reaction to the command signal and a direct, proportional feed-forward of the command signal itself ($2 u(t)$).\n\n3.  **Total Response ($y(t)$)**\n\nThe total output is the sum of the homogeneous and forced responses:\n$$\ny(t) = y_h(t) + y_f(t) = (t+1)\\exp(-t) + \\left(\\frac{t^2}{2} + t + 2\\right)\\exp(-t)\n$$\n$$\ny(t) = \\left(t + 1 + \\frac{t^2}{2} + t + 2\\right)\\exp(-t)\n$$\n$$\ny(t) = \\left(\\frac{t^2}{2} + 2t + 3\\right)\\exp(-t)\n$$\nThis final expression represents the complete behavior of the system's output for $t \\geq 0$, combining the effects of its initial state and the external input.",
