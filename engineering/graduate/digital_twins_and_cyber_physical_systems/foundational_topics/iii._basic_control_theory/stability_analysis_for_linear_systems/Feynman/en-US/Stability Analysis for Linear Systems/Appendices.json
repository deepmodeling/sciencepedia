The open-loop transfer function, $L(s)$, is the product of the gain $k$, the Padé approximation of the delay $P(s)$, and the plant transfer function $G(s)$.\n\nThe first-order Padé approximation for a delay of $\\tau = 1$ s is:\n$$ P(s) = \\frac{1 - \\frac{s(1)}{2}}{1 + \\frac{s(1)}{2}} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{s}{2}}{1 + \\frac{s}{2}} = \\frac{2-s}{2+s} $$\nThe open-loop transfer function is:\n$$ L(s) = k \\cdot P(s) \\cdot G(s) = k \\left( \\frac{2-s}{2+s} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{s(s+2)^2} \\right) $$\nThe characteristic equation for a unity-feedback system is $1 + L(s) = 0$.\n$$ 1 + k \\left( \\frac{2-s}{2+s} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{s(s+2)^2} \\right) = 0 $$\nTo obtain the characteristic polynomial $p(s)$, we clear the denominators:\n$$ s(s+2)^2(s+2) + k(2-s) = 0 $$\n$$ s(s+2)^3 + k(2-s) = 0 $$\nExpanding the polynomial:\n$$ s(s^3 + 3s^2(2) + 3s(2^2) + 2^3) + 2k - ks = 0 $$\n$$ s(s^3 + 6s^2 + 12s + 8) + 2k - ks = 0 $$\n$$ s^4 + 6s^3 + 12s^2 + 8s + 2k - ks = 0 $$\nThe characteristic polynomial $p(s)$ is:\n$$ p(s) = s^4 + 6s^3 + 12s^2 + (8-k)s + 2k = 0 $$\nThis is the required fourth-order polynomial, with coefficients $a_4=1$, $a_3=6$, $a_2=12$, $a_1=8-k$, and $a_0=2k$.\n\nNext, we construct the Routh array for $p(s)$ to analyze its stability.\nThe array is constructed as follows:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|ccc}\ns^4  a_4  a_2  a_0 \\\\\ns^3  a_3  a_1  0 \\\\\ns^2  b_1  b_2  0 \\\\\ns^1  c_1  0  0 \\\\\ns^0  d_1  0  0\n\\end{array}\n\\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad\n\\begin{array}{c|ccc}\ns^4  1  12  2k \\\\\ns^3  6  8-k  0 \\\\\ns^2  b_1  b_2  0 \\\\\ns^1  c_1  0  0 \\\\\ns^0  d_1  0  0\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe elements $b_1, b_2, c_1, d_1$ are calculated symbolically in terms of $k$:\n$$ b_1 = \\frac{a_3 a_2 - a_4 a_1}{a_3} = \\frac{(6)(12) - (1)(8-k)}{6} = \\frac{72 - 8 + k}{6} = \\frac{64+k}{6} $$\n$$ b_2 = \\frac{a_3 a_0 - a_4 (0)}{a_3} = a_0 = 2k $$\n$$ c_1 = \\frac{b_1 a_1 - a_3 b_2}{b_1} = \\frac{(\\frac{64+k}{6})(8-k) - (6)(2k)}{\\frac{64+k}{6}} = \\frac{(64+k)(8-k) - 72k}{64+k} $$\nThe numerator of $c_1$ is $(64+k)(8-k) - 72k = 512 + 8k - 64k - k^2 - 72k = -k^2 - 128k + 512$.\n$$ c_1 = \\frac{-k^2 - 128k + 512}{64+k} $$\n$$ d_1 = \\frac{c_1 b_2 - b_1(0)}{c_1} = b_2 = 2k $$\nThe complete symbolic Routh array is:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c}\ns^4  1 \\\\\ns^3  6 \\\\\ns^2  \\frac{64+k}{6} \\\\\ns^1  \\frac{-k^2 - 128k + 512}{64+k} \\\\\ns^0  2k\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nFor the system to be stable, the Routh-Hurwitz criterion requires that all elements in the first column of the Routh array be positive. The number of sign changes in this column equals the number of roots of $p(s)$ in the right-half of the complex plane (RHP).\n1.  $1  0$ (satisfied).\n2.  $6  0$ (satisfied).\n3.  $2k  0 \\implies k  0$.\n4.  $\\frac{64+k}{6}  0 \\implies 64+k  0 \\implies k  -64$. Combined with the previous condition, we need $k0$.\n5.  $\\frac{-k^2 - 128k + 512}{64+k}  0$. Since condition 4 implies $64+k  0$, we require the numerator to be positive:\n    $$ -k^2 - 128k + 512  0 \\implies k^2 + 128k - 512  0 $$\nTo find the range of $k$ that satisfies this inequality, we find the roots of $k^2 + 128k - 512 = 0$ using the quadratic formula:\n$$ k = \\frac{-128 \\pm \\sqrt{128^2 - 4(1)(-512)}}{2} = \\frac{-128 \\pm \\sqrt{16384 + 2048}}{2} $$\n$$ k = \\frac{-128 \\pm \\sqrt{18432}}{2} $$\nTo simplify the radical, we factor $18432$: $18432 = 9216 \\times 2 = (96)^2 \\times 2$. Thus, $\\sqrt{18432} = 96\\sqrt{2}$.\n$$ k = \\frac{-128 \\pm 96\\sqrt{2}}{2} = -64 \\pm 48\\sqrt{2} $$\nThe quadratic $k^2 + 128k - 512$ is a parabola opening upwards, so it is negative between its roots. The stability condition is:\n$$ -64 - 48\\sqrt{2}  k  -64 + 48\\sqrt{2} $$\nFor stability, all conditions must hold simultaneously. The intersection of $k  0$ and $-64-48\\sqrt{2}  k  -64+48\\sqrt{2}$ is:\n$$ 0  k  -64 + 48\\sqrt{2} $$\n\nThe special-case condition for marginal stability with purely imaginary roots occurs when an entire row of the Routh array becomes zero. This happens to the $s^1$ row if its only non-zero element, $c_1$, becomes zero.\n$$ c_1 = \\frac{-k^2 - 128k + 512}{64+k} = 0 $$\nThis requires the numerator to be zero:\n$$ -k^2 - 128k + 512 = 0 \\implies k^2 + 128k - 512 = 0 $$\nThe roots of this equation are $k = -64 \\pm 48\\sqrt{2}$. These are the values of $k$ at the boundary of stability. Since physical gain $k$ must be positive for stability (as shown by the $s^0$ row element $2k  0$), the gain for marginal stability is the positive root:\n$$ k_{marginal} = -64 + 48\\sqrt{2} $$\nAt this value of $k$, the $s^1$ row is zero. The roots that lie on the imaginary axis can be found from the auxiliary polynomial, $A(s)$, which is constructed from the coefficients of the row immediately above the zero row (the $s^2$ row).\n$$ A(s) = b_1 s^2 + b_2 = \\left(\\frac{64+k}{6}\\right)s^2 + 2k $$\nThe roots of $A(s)=0$ give the purely imaginary roots of $p(s)$ at $k = k_{marginal}$. Substituting $k = -64 + 48\\sqrt{2}$ into $A(s)$:\n$s^2 = -\\frac{12k}{64+k} = -\\frac{12(-64+48\\sqrt{2})}{64+(-64+48\\sqrt{2})} = -\\frac{12(-64+48\\sqrt{2})}{48\\sqrt{2}} = -\\frac{-64+48\\sqrt{2}}{4\\sqrt{2}}$\n$s^2 = -(-\\frac{16}{\\sqrt{2}} + 12) = -(-8\\sqrt{2} + 12) = 8\\sqrt{2} - 12$.\nSince $8\\sqrt{2} \\approx 8(1.414) = 11.312$, the value of $s^2$ is negative ($11.312 - 12 = -0.688$), confirming a pair of purely imaginary roots, $s = \\pm j\\sqrt{12 - 8\\sqrt{2}}$, which cause sustained oscillations.\n\nThe problem asks for the exact analytic expression for the proportional gain $k$ at which this special-case marginal stability occurs. This is the positive value of $k$ that makes the $s^1$ row of the Routh array zero.\n$$ k = -64 + 48\\sqrt{2} $$",

No contradictions or ambiguities are present.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**1. Existence and Uniqueness of the Solution P**\n\nThe discrete-time Lyapunov equation is $A^{\\top} P A - P = -Q$. This equation is linear in the elements of the matrix $P$. It can be written in a vectorized form using the Kronecker product $\\otimes$. Let $p = \\text{vec}(P)$ and $q = \\text{vec}(Q)$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n(A^{\\top} \\otimes A^{\\top}) p - p = -q \\implies (I - A^{\\top} \\otimes A^{\\top}) p = q\n$$\nA unique solution for $p$ (and thus for $P$) exists if and only if the matrix $(I - A^{\\top} \\otimes A^{\\top})$ is invertible. This requires that none of its eigenvalues are zero.\nThe eigenvalues of a Kronecker product $M \\otimes N$ are the products of the eigenvalues of $M$ and $N$. Let the eigenvalues of $A$ (and $A^{\\top}$) be $\\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_n$. The eigenvalues of $A^{\\top} \\otimes A^{\\top}$ are $\\lambda_i \\lambda_j$ for all pairs $i, j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nThe eigenvalues of $(I - A^{\\top} \\otimes A^{\\top})$ are therefore $1 - \\lambda_i \\lambda_j$.\nThe matrix is invertible if and only if $1 - \\lambda_i \\lambda_j \\neq 0$ for all $i, j$. This is equivalent to $\\lambda_i \\lambda_j \\neq 1$.\nThe condition that $A$ is Schur stable means $|\\lambda_k|  1$ for all $k$. This implies $|\\lambda_i \\lambda_j| = |\\lambda_i||\\lambda_j|  1 \\times 1 = 1$. Consequently, $\\lambda_i \\lambda_j$ can never be equal to $1$.\nThus, for a Schur stable matrix $A$, a unique solution $P$ to the Lyapunov equation exists.\n\nTo show that this unique solution $P$ is positive definite ($P \\succ 0$) when $Q \\succ 0$, we can express $P$ as an infinite series. From $P = A^{\\top} P A + Q$, we can iterate:\n$$\nP = A^{\\top}(A^{\\top} P A + Q)A + Q = (A^{\\top})^2 P A^2 + A^{\\top} Q A + Q\n$$\nContinuing this iteration $k-1$ times yields:\n$$\nP = (A^{\\top})^k P A^k + \\sum_{j=0}^{k-1} (A^{\\top})^j Q A^j\n$$\nSince $A$ is Schur stable, $\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} A^k = 0$. Therefore, the term $(A^{\\top})^k P A^k$ vanishes in the limit. The unique solution $P$ is given by the convergent series:\n$$\nP = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} (A^{\\top})^j Q A^j\n$$\nTo prove $P$ is positive definite, consider the quadratic form $x^{\\top} P x$ for any non-zero vector $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$:\n$$\nx^{\\top} P x = x^{\\top} \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} (A^{\\top})^j Q A^j \\right) x = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} x^{\\top} (A^{\\top})^j Q A^j x = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} (A^j x)^{\\top} Q (A^j x)\n$$\nSince $Q \\succ 0$, each term in the sum $(A^j x)^{\\top} Q (A^j x)$ is non-negative. For the sum to be positive, at least one term must be strictly positive. The first term ($j=0$) is $x^{\\top} Q x$. As $x \\neq 0$ and $Q \\succ 0$, we have $x^{\\top} Q x  0$.\nThus, $x^{\\top} P x  0$ for all $x \\neq 0$, which proves that $P$ is positive definite.\n\n**2. Solving for the Matrix P**\n\nLet $P = \\begin{pmatrix} p_{11}  p_{12} \\\\ p_{12}  p_{22} \\end{pmatrix}$ be the symmetric matrix to be found. The equation $A^{\\top} P A - P = -I$ leads to a system of linear equations for the elements of $P$.\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0.85  -0.05 \\\\ 0.10  0.90 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} p_{11}  p_{12} \\\\ p_{12}  p_{22} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.85  0.10 \\\\ -0.05  0.90 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} p_{11}  p_{12} \\\\ p_{12}  p_{22} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nPerforming the matrix multiplications and equating the elements yields the following system of three unique linear equations:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item $(1,1)$-element: $0.7225p_{11} - 0.085p_{12} + 0.0025p_{22} - p_{11} = -1 \\implies -0.2775p_{11} - 0.085p_{12} + 0.0025p_{22} = -1$\n    \\item $(1,2)$-element: $0.085p_{11} + 0.76p_{12} - 0.045p_{22} - p_{12} = 0 \\implies 0.085p_{11} - 0.24p_{12} - 0.045p_{22} = 0$\n    \\item $(2,2)$-element: $0.01p_{11} + 0.18p_{12} + 0.81p_{22} - p_{22} = -1 \\implies 0.01p_{11} + 0.18p_{12} - 0.19p_{22} = -1$\n\\end{enumerate}\nThis system can be written more cleanly by multiplying by constants:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item $111 p_{11} + 34 p_{12} - p_{22} = 400$\n    \\item $17 p_{11} - 48 p_{12} - 9 p_{22} = 0$\n    \\item $p_{11} + 18 p_{12} - 19 p_{22} = -100$\n\\end{enumerate}\nSolving this system of linear equations yields the exact solution:\n$$\np_{11} = \\frac{58125}{16192}, \\quad p_{12} = \\frac{3425}{16192}, \\quad p_{22} = \\frac{91525}{16192}\n$$\nSo, the matrix $P$ is:\n$$\nP = \\frac{1}{16192} \\begin{pmatrix} 58125  3425 \\\\ 3425  91525 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n**3. Derivation of the Contraction Factor**\n\nThe Lyapunov function is $V(x_k) = x_k^{\\top} P x_k$.

            "introduction": "Real-world systems, especially cyber-physical systems with communication networks, often include time delays, which introduce transcendental terms like $e^{-sT}$ into the system's characteristic equation, making polynomial-based analysis challenging. The Nyquist stability criterion, a cornerstone of frequency-domain analysis, is exceptionally adept at handling such complexities. This computational practice  bridges theory and implementation by guiding you through the development of a program to perform Nyquist analysis. You will directly compare the stability of a system with an exact time delay to that of its practical Padé approximations, gaining critical insight into the fidelity and limitations of models used in modern control and digital twin applications.",

            "problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant open-loop actuator channel in a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) digital twin with an input-to-actuator delay. The open-loop transfer function is defined as $L(s) = K(s) G(s) D(s)$, where $s$ is the complex Laplace variable. The controller is proportional, given by $K(s) = k$, and the actuator plant is first-order, given by $G(s) = \\frac{1}{\\tau s + 1}$, where $\\tau$ is a positive time constant in seconds. The delay $D(s)$ is either the exact exponential $e^{-sT}$, where $T$ is a nonnegative delay in seconds, or a rational Padé approximation $D_n(s)$ of order $n$. For computational comparison, use the first-order Padé approximation $D_1(s) = \\frac{1 - \\frac{sT}{2}}{1 + \\frac{sT}{2}}$ and the second-order Padé approximation $D_2(s) = \\frac{1 - \\frac{sT}{2} + \\frac{(sT)^2}{12}}{1 + \\frac{sT}{2} + \\frac{(sT)^2}{12}}$. The closed-loop characteristic function is $F(s) = 1 + L(s)$.\n\nYour task is to implement a program that performs Nyquist stability analysis for both the exact delay and the Padé-approximated delay. The analysis must be grounded in the Principle of the Argument: the number of clockwise encirclements of the critical point in the appropriate complex mapping equals the net change of the argument along the Nyquist contour divided by $2\\pi$. Specifically, evaluate the image of the imaginary axis under $F(s)$, given by $F(j\\omega)$ for real frequency $\\omega$ (where $j$ is the imaginary unit), and compute the winding number of $F(j\\omega)$ about the origin to infer closed-loop stability. Angles must be computed in radians.\n\nFor each test case, do the following:\n- Evaluate $F_{\\text{exact}}(j\\omega) = 1 + k \\frac{1}{1 + j \\omega \\tau} e^{-j \\omega T}$ for a frequency grid spanning $\\omega \\in [-\\Omega_{\\max}, \\Omega_{\\max}]$, and compute the unwrapped net change in argument of $F_{\\text{exact}}(j\\omega)$ along the path from $-\\Omega_{\\max}$ to $\\Omega_{\\max}$, then divide by $2\\pi$ and round to the nearest integer to obtain the winding number $N_{\\text{exact}}$.\n- Evaluate $F_{\\text{pade}}(j\\omega) = 1 + k \\frac{1}{1 + j \\omega \\tau} D_n(j\\omega)$ for the same grid and compute $N_{\\text{pade}}$ similarly.\n- Assume the open-loop $L(s)$ has no right-half-plane poles for the exact delay and for the given Padé approximations (which is true for the specified plant and Padé orders). Conclude closed-loop stability for each representation as a boolean by checking whether the corresponding winding number is zero, i.e., stable if the integer winding number equals $0$ and unstable otherwise.\n- Use angles in radians. No physical units are required in the output because the requested outputs are booleans and integers.\n\nFrequency grid specification:\n- Construct a symmetric frequency grid that includes $0$ and spans negative to positive frequencies, using a logarithmic spacing on the positive side and mirroring to the negative side. Let $\\Omega_{\\max} = \\max\\left(\\frac{1000}{\\tau}, \\frac{100}{T + \\varepsilon}\\right)$ with $\\varepsilon$ a small positive number to avoid division by zero when $T = 0$, and use at least $400$ points on the positive side. Ensure numerical robustness by unwrapping the angle of $F(j\\omega)$ along the ordered grid from $-\\Omega_{\\max}$ to $\\Omega_{\\max}$.\n\nTest Suite:\n- Case $1$: $(\\tau, k, T, n) = (0.1 \\text{ s}, 1.0, 0.02 \\text{ s}, 1)$\n- Case $2$: $(\\tau, k, T, n) = (0.1 \\text{ s}, 4.0, 0.3 \\text{ s}, 1)$\n- Case $3$: $(\\tau, k, T, n) = (0.05 \\text{ s}, 5.0, 0.0 \\text{ s}, 1)$\n- Case $4$: $(\\tau, k, T, n) = (0.2 \\text{ s}, 3.0, 0.5 \\text{ s}, 2)$\n- Case $5$: $(\\tau, k, T, n) = (0.1 \\text{ s}, 2.0, 0.2 \\text{ s}, 2)$\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results for all test cases as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. For each test case, report a list with four entries: the integer $N_{\\text{exact}}$, the integer $N_{\\text{pade}}$, the boolean for exact-delay stability, and the boolean for Padé-approximation stability. The final output should look like a Python-style list of lists, for example, $[[0,0,True,True],[\\dots],\\dots]$.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid. It presents a well-posed and scientifically grounded task in the domain of control systems engineering, specifically the stability analysis of a linear time-invariant system with input delay. The provided methods, parameters, and objectives are clear, consistent, and computationally feasible.\n\nThe core of this problem is the application of the Nyquist stability criterion to a closed-loop system. The stability of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system is determined by the locations of the poles of its closed-loop transfer function in the complex $s$-plane. Poles in the right-half plane (RHP) result in an unstable system. The closed-loop characteristic equation is given by $F(s) = 1 + L(s) = 0$, where $L(s)$ is the open-loop transfer function. The roots of $F(s)$ are the closed-loop poles.\n\nThe Nyquist stability criterion, based on Cauchy's Principle of the Argument, provides a graphical method to determine closed-loop stability from the open-loop frequency response. The criterion states that $Z = P - N$, where $Z$ is the number of unstable (RHP) closed-loop poles, $P$ is the number of unstable (RHP) open-loop poles, and $N$ is the number of counter-clockwise encirclements of the critical point ($-1 + j0$) by the Nyquist plot of $L(j\\omega)$. An equivalent formulation, which is used here, considers the encirclements of the origin ($0 + j0$) by the plot of $F(j\\omega) = 1 + L(j\\omega)$.\n\nThe problem specifies that the open-loop transfer function $L(s) = K(s)G(s)D(s)$ has no poles in the RHP. Let us verify this. The controller $K(s) = k$ is a constant and contributes no poles. The plant $G(s) = \\frac{1}{\\tau s + 1}$ has a single pole at $s = -1/\\tau$. Since $\\tau$ is a positive time constant, this pole is in the left-half plane (LHP). The exact delay $D(s) = e^{-sT}$ is a transcendental function and introduces no poles. The Padé approximations, $D_1(s)$ and $D_2(s)$, are rational functions structured as all-pass filters. Their poles are the mirror images of their zeros across the imaginary axis; since their zeros are in the RHP, their poles are in the LHP. Thus, the assumption of $P=0$ is correct.\n\nWith $P=0$, the stability criterion simplifies to $Z = -N$. For the system to be stable, we require $Z=0$, which in turn requires the number of encirclements $N$ to be $0$. The system is stable if and only if the Nyquist plot of $F(j\\omega)$ does not encircle the origin.\n\nThe number of encirclements, or the winding number $N$, is calculated by tracking the total change in the argument (angle) of the complex function $F(j\\omega)$ as the frequency $\\omega$ sweeps along the Nyquist contour. The standard Nyquist contour encloses the entire RHP, consisting of the imaginary axis from $-j\\infty$ to $+j\\infty$ and a large semicircle closing the path on the right. For the given system, $L(s) \\to 0$ as $|s| \\to \\infty$ in the RHP. Consequently, $F(s) = 1 + L(s) \\to 1$. The large semicircle portion of the contour maps to a single point at $1$ and does not contribute to the encirclement of the origin. Therefore, we only need to evaluate the change in phase along the imaginary axis, from $\\omega = -\\infty$ to $\\omega = +\\infty$.\n\nIn practice, we evaluate over a finite but sufficiently large frequency range, $[-\\Omega_{\\max}, \\Omega_{\\max}]$. The winding number $N$ is then calculated as:\n$$\nN = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left[ \\arg(F(j\\omega)) \\right]_{\\omega=-\\Omega_{\\max}}^{\\omega=\\Omega_{\\max}} = \\frac{\\phi(\\Omega_{\\max}) - \\phi(-\\Omega_{\\max})}{2\\pi}\n$$\nwhere $\\phi(\\omega)$ is the unwrapped phase of $F(j\\omega)$. The unwrapping is crucial to correctly accumulate the total angle change across branch cuts of the standard `atan2` function, which typically returns angles in $(-\\pi, \\pi]$. The final result is rounded to the nearest integer.\n\nThe analysis is performed for two representations of the delay:\n1.  **Exact Delay:** The frequency response is $F_{\\text{exact}}(j\\omega) = 1 + L_{\\text{exact}}(j\\omega)$, where\n    $$\n    L_{\\text{exact}}(j\\omega) = k \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 + j \\omega \\tau} \\cdot e^{-j \\omega T}\n    $$\n2.  **Padé Approximation:** The frequency response is $F_{\\text{pade}}(j\\omega) = 1 + L_{\\text{pade}}(j\\omega)$, where\n    $$\n    L_{\\text{pade}}(j\\omega) = k \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 + j \\omega \\tau} \\cdot D_n(j\\omega)\n    $$\n    For $n=1$, the first-order Padé approximation is used:\n    $$\n    D_1(j\\omega) = \\frac{1 - \\frac{j\\omega T}{2}}{1 + \\frac{j\\omega T}{2}}\n    $$\n    For $n=2$, the second-order Padé approximation is used:\n    $$\n    D_2(j\\omega) = \\frac{1 - \\frac{j\\omega T}{2} + \\frac{(j\\omega T)^2}{12}}{1 + \\frac{j\\omega T}{2} + \\frac{(j\\omega T)^2}{12}} = \\frac{\\left(1 - \\frac{(\\omega T)^2}{12}\\right) - j\\frac{\\omega T}{2}}{\\left(1 - \\frac{(\\omega T)^2}{12}\\right) + j\\frac{\\omega T}{2}}\n    $$\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows for each test case $(\\tau, k, T, n)$:\n1.  A symmetric frequency grid $\\omega$ is constructed, spanning from $-\\Omega_{\\max}$ to $\\Omega_{\\max}$ with logarithmic spacing on the positive side. The maximum frequency $\\Omega_{\\max} = \\max\\left(\\frac{1000}{\\tau}, \\frac{100}{T + \\varepsilon}\\right)$ is chosen to be large enough to capture the system's relevant dynamics.\n2.  The complex values of $F_{\\text{exact}}(j\\omega)$ and $F_{\\text{pade}}(j\\omega)$ are computed for all frequencies in the grid.\n3.  The `unwrap` function is applied to the arguments of the complex arrays $F_{\\text{exact}}(j\\omega)$ and $F_{\\text{pade}}(j\\omega)$ to obtain the continuous phase profiles.\n4.  The winding numbers $N_{\\text{exact}}$ and $N_{\\text{pade}}$ are computed from the net change in the unwrapped phases, divided by $2\\pi$, and rounded to the nearest integer.\n5.  Stability is determined for each model: `True` if the corresponding winding number is $0$, and `False` otherwise.\n6.  The results $[N_{\\text{exact}}, N_{\\text{pade}}, \\text{stable}_{\\text{exact}}, \\text{stable}_{\\text{pade}}]$ are compiled for all test cases.",
