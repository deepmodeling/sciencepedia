The solution is mathematically verifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. I will proceed to provide a complete solution.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part analysis of a real-time task set. First, we assess its schedulability under two different scheduling policies. Second, we calculate a scaling factor to make the task set schedulable under a specific condition.\n\nThe utilization $U_i$ of a single periodic task $\\tau_i$ is the ratio of its worst-case execution time $C_i$ to its period $T_i$:\n$$U_i = \\frac{C_i}{T_i}$$\nThe total utilization $U$ of the task set is the sum of the individual task utilizations:\n$$U = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} U_i$$\nThe given task set is $\\{(2,5), (1,4), (2,10)\\}$. We calculate the total utilization for the $n=3$ tasks:\n$$U = \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{2}{10}$$\nTo sum these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $20$:\n$$U = \\frac{2 \\times 4}{20} + \\frac{1 \\times 5}{20} + \\frac{2 \\times 2}{20} = \\frac{8+5+4}{20} = \\frac{17}{20}$$\nAs a decimal, the total utilization is $U = 0.85$.\n\nNow we assess schedulability.\n\n**Rate-Monotonic Scheduling (RMS) Analysis:**\nRMS is a fixed-priority preemptive scheduling algorithm where tasks with shorter periods are assigned higher priorities. A sufficient (but not necessary) condition for the schedulability of $n$ independent periodic tasks with $D_i = T_i$ is the Liu and Layland utilization bound:\n$$U \\le n\\left(2^{1/n} - 1\\right)$$\nFor $n=3$ tasks, the bound is:\n$$U_{RMS\\_bound} = 3\\left(2^{1/3} - 1\\right)$$\nNumerically, this value is approximately:\n$$U_{RMS\\_bound} \\approx 3\\left(1.259921 - 1\\right) = 3\\left(0.259921\\right) \\approx 0.77976$$\nWe compare the total utilization $U$ to this bound:\n$$0.85 \\le 0.77976$$\nThis inequality is false. Since the total utilization $U = 0.85$ exceeds the sufficient bound for RMS, we cannot guarantee the schedulability of this task set using this test.\n\n**Earliest Deadline First (EDF) Analysis:**\nEDF is a dynamic-priority preemptive scheduling algorithm where the ready task with the earliest absolute deadline has the highest priority. For a set of independent periodic tasks on a uniprocessor with $D_i=T_i$, the necessary and sufficient condition for schedulability is:\n$$U \\le 1$$\nWe compare the total utilization $U$ to this bound:\n$$0.85 \\le 1$$\nThis inequality is true. Therefore, the task set is schedulable under EDF.\n\n**Calculation of the Scaling Factor $\\alpha$:**\nThe second part of the problem involves scaling the worst-case execution time of each task, $C_i$, by a common factor $\\alpha$, where $0  \\alpha \\le 1$. The new execution times are $C'_i = \\alpha C_i$.\n\nThe new total utilization, denoted as $U'$, is:\n$$U' = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{C'_i}{T_i} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\alpha C_i}{T_i} = \\alpha \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{C_i}{T_i}\\right) = \\alpha U$$\nWe are asked to find the minimal $\\alpha$ that makes the task set meet the RMS utilization-sufficient bound exactly. This means we set the new utilization $U'$ equal to the RMS bound:\n$$U' = n\\left(2^{1/n} - 1\\right)$$\nSubstituting $U' = \\alpha U$ and the values for $n$ and $U$:\n$$\\alpha \\left(\\frac{17}{20}\\right) = 3\\left(2^{1/3} - 1\\right)$$\nNow, we solve for $\\alpha$:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{20}{17} \\left(3\\left(2^{1/3} - 1\\right)\\right)$$\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{60}{17}\\left(2^{1/3} - 1\\right)$$\nTo find the numerical value, we use the previously calculated value for the RMS bound:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{20}{17} \\times U_{RMS\\_bound} \\approx \\frac{20}{17} \\times 0.779763$$\n$$\\alpha \\approx 1.17647 \\times 0.779763 \\approx 0.917368$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$\\alpha \\approx 0.9174$$\nThis value of $\\alpha$ is the minimum scaling factor that reduces the execution times just enough for the task set's total utilization to be exactly equal to the RMS schedulability bound for $n=3$ tasks.",

This exercise moves to a more powerful and precise method: worst-case response-time analysis (RTA), which provides an exact schedulability test for fixed-priority systems. You will calculate the response time for a task by accounting for preemption from higher-priority tasks and blocking from lower-priority tasks, reflecting the complex interactions common in real-world cyber-physical systems .",

            "problem": "A digital twin of a cyber-physical system is hosted on a single-core microcontroller executing a set of periodic tasks under Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS), where priorities are assigned according to task periods. Consider the following four periodic tasks that comprise the sensing, estimation, control, and synchronization pipeline:\n\n- Task $\\tau_1$: execution time $C_1 = 1$ milliseconds, period $T_1 = 5$ milliseconds, relative deadline $D_1 = 5$ milliseconds.\n- Task $\\tau_2$: execution time $C_2 = 2$ milliseconds, period $T_2 = 12$ milliseconds, relative deadline $D_2 = 9$ milliseconds.\n- Task $\\tau_3$: execution time $C_3 = 3$ milliseconds, period $T_3 = 20$ milliseconds, relative deadline $D_3 = 14$ milliseconds.\n- Task $\\tau_4$: execution time $C_4 = 5$ milliseconds, period $T_4 = 50$ milliseconds, relative deadline $D_4 = 30$ milliseconds.\n\nAll tasks are released periodically without release jitter and execute with preemption. There is one non-preemptive input/output (I/O) operation in the lowest-priority task $\\tau_4$ that may block higher-priority tasks for up to $1$ millisecond if it holds a shared device lock; assume this is the only source of blocking and that $\\tau_4$’s non-preemptive critical section can delay $\\tau_3$ by at most $1$ millisecond.\n\nUsing first principles of fixed-priority uniprocessor scheduling, determine the worst-case response time of task $\\tau_3$ under RMS and decide schedulability by testing whether the worst-case response time does not exceed its relative deadline. Express the final value of the worst-case response time in milliseconds. Round neither intermediate nor final results; provide the exact value. In the final answer box, write only the numerical value of the worst-case response time of $\\tau_3$ in milliseconds.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the worst-case response time (WCRT) for task $\\tau_3$ in a real-time system scheduled under the Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS) algorithm. The schedulability of $\\tau_3$ is then assessed by comparing its WCRT to its relative deadline. The analysis will be performed using the established principles of Response Time Analysis (RTA) for fixed-priority preemptive systems.\n\nFirst, we establish the priority ordering of the tasks. Under RMS, task priority is inversely proportional to its period ($T_i$). The given periods are:\n- $T_1 = 5$ ms\n- $T_2 = 12$ ms\n- $T_3 = 20$ ms\n- $T_4 = 50$ ms\n\nSince $T_1  T_2  T_3  T_4$, the priority ordering is $P_1  P_2  P_3  P_4$. Thus, task $\\tau_1$ has the highest priority, and task $\\tau_4$ has the lowest priority.\n\nThe WCRT of a task $\\tau_i$, denoted $R_i$, can be found by solving the following recurrence relation, which accounts for the task's own execution time, blocking from lower-priority tasks, and preemption from higher-priority tasks:\n$$R_i = C_i + B_i + \\sum_{j \\in hp(i)} \\left\\lceil \\frac{R_i}{T_j} \\right\\rceil C_j$$\nHere, $C_i$ is the worst-case execution time of $\\tau_i$, $B_i$ is the maximum blocking time $\\tau_i$ can experience from tasks with lower priority, and $hp(i)$ is the set of all tasks with priority higher than $\\tau_i$. The term $\\lceil \\frac{R_i}{T_j} \\rceil$ represents the maximum number of times task $\\tau_j$ can be released (and thus preempt $\\tau_i$) during the response time of $\\tau_i$.\n\nThis equation is solved iteratively. A stable solution is found when two consecutive iterations yield the same value. The iterative sequence is:\n$$R_i^{(k+1)} = C_i + B_i + \\sum_{j \\in hp(i)} \\left\\lceil \\frac{R_i^{(k)}}{T_j} \\right\\rceil C_j$$\nThe initial guess can be set to $R_i^{(0)} = C_i$.\n\nWe are asked to find the WCRT of task $\\tau_3$. The relevant parameters are:\n- Own execution time: $C_3 = 3$ ms.\n- Set of higher-priority tasks: $hp(3) = \\{\\tau_1, \\tau_2\\}$.\n- Parameters of higher-priority tasks:\n    - $\\tau_1$: $C_1 = 1$ ms, $T_1 = 5$ ms.\n    - $\\tau_2$: $C_2 = 2$ ms, $T_2 = 12$ ms.\n- Blocking term: The problem states that a non-preemptive section in the lowest-priority task $\\tau_4$ can delay $\\tau_3$ by at most $1$ millisecond. This is the only source of blocking. Therefore, $B_3 = 1$ ms.\n\nSubstituting these values into the RTA formula for $\\tau_3$:\n$$R_3 = C_3 + B_3 + \\left\\lceil \\frac{R_3}{T_1} \\right\\rceil C_1 + \\left\\lceil \\frac{R_3}{T_2} \\right\\rceil C_2$$\n$$R_3 = 3 + 1 + \\left\\lceil \\frac{R_3}{5} \\right\\rceil (1) + \\left\\lceil \\frac{R_3}{12} \\right\\rceil (2)$$\n$$R_3 = 4 + \\left\\lceil \\frac{R_3}{5} \\right\\rceil + 2 \\left\\lceil \\frac{R_3}{12} \\right\\rceil$$\n\nNow, we solve this equation iteratively.

The worst-case response time of task $\\tau_3$ is $R_3 = 8$ ms.\n\nFinally, we must check for schedulability. A task is schedulable if its worst-case response time does not exceed its relative deadline, i.e., $R_i \\le D_i$. For task $\\tau_3$, we have:\n- WCRT: $R_3 = 8$ ms.\n- Relative deadline: $D_3 = 14$ ms.\n\nComparing these values, we find that $8 \\le 14$. The condition is satisfied, which means that task $\\tau_3$ is schedulable. The problem asks for the numerical value of the worst-case response time of $\\tau_3$.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is a standard problem in real-time systems theory, providing all necessary parameters to proceed with a solution.\n\nThe problem asks for two parts: first, a theoretical explanation of the behavior of Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS) and Earliest Deadline First (EDF) under overload, and second, a quantitative calculation of the tardiness for a specific job under EDF scheduling.\n\n**Part 1: RMS vs. EDF Behavior Under Overload**\n\nThe system is defined by two periodic tasks, $\\tau_{1}$ and $\\tau_{2}$, with periods $T_{1} = 10\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ and $T_{2} = 11\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, and worst-case execution times $C_{1} = 6\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ and $C_{2} = 6\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. The total processor utilization $U$ is given by:\n$$U = \\frac{C_{1}}{T_{1}} + \\frac{C_{2}}{T_{2}} = \\frac{6}{10} + \\frac{6}{11} = \\frac{66 + 60}{110} = \\frac{126}{110} = \\frac{63}{55} \\approx 1.145$$\nSince $U  1$, the processor is in an overload condition, meaning that over time, the total computational work demanded by the tasks exceeds the processor's capacity. It is therefore impossible for all jobs to meet their deadlines.\n\n**Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS):**\nRMS is a static-priority scheduling algorithm where priority is assigned based on the task's rate, which is the inverse of its period. A task with a shorter period (higher rate) receives a higher priority.\nIn this system, $T_{1} = 10\\,\\mathrm{ms}  T_{2} = 11\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, so task $\\tau_{1}$ is assigned a higher priority than task $\\tau_{2}$.\nUnder RMS, a high-priority job will always preempt a low-priority job. Consequently, the set of higher-priority tasks is schedulable as if the lower-priority tasks do not exist. For $\\tau_{1}$, its own utilization is $U_{1} = \\frac{C_{1}}{T_{1}} = \\frac{6}{10} = 0.6$. Since $U_{1} \\le 1$, task $\\tau_{1}$ is schedulable by itself. All jobs of $\\tau_{1}$ will therefore always meet their deadlines.\nThe lower-priority task, $\\tau_{2}$, will only be allowed to execute when the processor is not demanded by $\\tau_{1}$. All the consequences of the system overload ($U  1$) are borne entirely by $\\tau_{2}$. Its jobs will miss their deadlines and accumulate tardiness, while $\\tau_{1}$ remains unaffected. This behavior is often termed \"graceful degradation\", as the most critical (highest-rate) task is protected.\n\n**Earliest Deadline First (EDF):**\nEDF is a dynamic-priority scheduling algorithm where the highest priority is assigned to the ready job with the earliest absolute deadline.\nUnder overload conditions, EDF does not intrinsically protect any specific task. Priority is determined solely by the deadlines of the active jobs, regardless of which task they belong to. When $U  1$, a \"domino effect\" of deadline misses typically occurs. A job that misses its deadline continues to occupy the processor, delaying the start of other jobs, which in turn may miss their deadlines.\nBecause EDF always prioritizes the most urgent job, it continues to run jobs whose deadlines have already passed in an attempt to complete them. This can delay jobs whose deadlines are still in the future, causing them to also become late. This can lead to a situation where all tasks miss their deadlines and the tardiness for all tasks can grow without bound. This is in stark contrast to RMS, where tardiness is isolated to the lower-priority tasks.\n\n**Part 2: Tardiness of the Fourth Job of Task $\\tau_{2}$ under EDF**\n\nTo determine the tardiness of the fourth job of $\\tau_{2}$, denoted $J_{2,4}$, we must simulate the EDF schedule from time $t=0$. A job $J_{i,k}$ is the $k$-th job of task $\\tau_{i}$, released at time $r_{i,k} = (k-1)T_{i}$ with an absolute deadline $d_{i,k} = k T_{i}$.\n\nThe fourth job of task $\\tau_{2}$, $J_{2,4}$, has:\nRelease time: $r_{2,4} = (4-1)T_{2} = 3 \\times 11 = 33\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\nAbsolute deadline: $d_{2,4} = 4 \\times T_{2} = 4 \\times 11 = 44\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\nWe need to find its finish time, $F_{2,4}$.\n\nThe schedule proceeds as follows:\n- **$t \\in [0, 6)$**: At $t=0$, jobs $J_{1,1}$ (deadline $d_{1,1}=10$) and $J_{2,1}$ ($d_{2,1}=11$) are released. EDF selects $J_{1,1}$. $J_{1,1}$ runs and finishes at $t=6$.\n- **$t \\in [6, 12)$**: EDF selects $J_{2,1}$. At $t=10$, $J_{1,2}$ arrives ($d_{1,2}=20$). $J_{2,1}$'s deadline ($11$) is earlier, so it continues. At $t=11$, $J_{2,2}$ arrives ($d_{2,2}=22$). $J_{2,1}$'s deadline ($11$) is still the earliest. $J_{2,1}$ requires $6\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ total and finishes at $t=6+6=12$. Its tardiness is $T_{2,1} = 12 - 11 = 1\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n- **$t \\in [12, 18)$**: The ready queue contains $J_{1,2}$ ($d_{1,2}=20$) and $J_{2,2}$ ($d_{2,2}=22$). EDF selects $J_{1,2}$. It runs for $6\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ and finishes at $t=18$.\n- **$t \\in [18, 24)$**: EDF selects $J_{2,2}$. During its execution, $J_{1,3}$ arrives at $t=20$ ($d_{1,3}=30$) and $J_{2,3}$ arrives at $t=22$ ($d_{2,3}=33$). In both cases, $J_{2,2}$'s deadline ($22$) is the earliest. $J_{2,2}$ runs for $6\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ and finishes at $t=18+6=24$.

At $t=33$, $J_{2,4}$ arrives ($d_{2,4}=44$). $J_{2,3}$'s deadline ($33$) remains the earliest. $J_{2,3}$ runs for $6\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ and finishes at $t=30+6=36$.

At $t=40$, $J_{1,5}$ arrives ($d_{1,5}=50$). $J_{1,4}$'s deadline ($40$) is still the earliest. $J_{1,4}$ runs for $6\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ and finishes at $t=36+6=42$. Its tardiness is $T_{1,4} = 42 - 40 = 2\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n- **$t \\in [42, 48)$**: The ready queue contains the job of interest, $J_{2,4}$ ($d_{2,4}=44$), and $J_{1,5}$ ($d_{1,5}=50$).

At $t=44$, $J_{2,5}$ arrives ($d_{2,5}=55$). $J_{2,4}$'s deadline ($44$) remains earliest. $J_{2,4}$ runs for its full execution time of $6\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ and finishes at $t=42+6=48$.\n\nThe finish time of the fourth job of task $\\tau_{2}$ is $F_{2,4} = 48\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\nThe absolute deadline of this job is $d_{2,4} = 44\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\nThe tardiness is defined as the finish time minus the absolute deadline:\n$$T_{2,4} = F_{2,4} - d_{2,4} = 48\\,\\mathrm{ms} - 44\\,\\mathrm{ms} = 4\\,\\mathrm{ms}$$\nThe tardiness of the fourth job of task $\\tau_2$ is $4\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. Notice the pattern of increasing tardiness for jobs of $\\tau_2$: $T_{2,1}=1$, $T_{2,2}=2$, $T_{2,3}=3$, $T_{2,4}=4$.",
