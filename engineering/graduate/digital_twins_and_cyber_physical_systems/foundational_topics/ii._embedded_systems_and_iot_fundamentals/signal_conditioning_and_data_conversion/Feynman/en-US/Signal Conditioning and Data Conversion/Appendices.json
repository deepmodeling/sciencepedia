It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution is derived by following the signal path from the transducer to the ADC.\n\nFirst, we calculate the differential output voltage from the strain gauge bridge at full mechanical load, denoted as $V_{\\text{bridge,FL}}$. The sensitivity $S$ is defined as the ratio of the output voltage to the excitation voltage.\n$$\nS = \\frac{V_{\\text{bridge,FL}}}{V_{\\text{ex}}}\n$$\nTherefore, the bridge output at full load is:\n$$\nV_{\\text{bridge,FL}} = S \\times V_{\\text{ex}}\n$$\nThe given sensitivity is $S = 2\\ \\mathrm{mV}/\\mathrm{V}$, which is equivalent to $S = 2 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{V}/\\mathrm{V}$. The excitation voltage is $V_{\\text{ex}} = 5\\ \\mathrm{V}$. Substituting these values:\n$$\nV_{\\text{bridge,FL}} = (2 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{V}/\\mathrm{V}) \\times 5\\ \\mathrm{V} = 10 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{V} = 0.01\\ \\mathrm{V}\n$$\nSince the bridge is perfectly balanced at no load, this value represents the full-scale differential signal from the transducer.\n\nNext, we determine the target magnitude for the amplified signal at the input of the ADC. The design requirement states that the amplified full-load signal magnitude, let's call it $|V_{\\text{amp,FL}}|$, must equal $0.90$ of the ADC's full-scale magnitude, $V_{\\mathrm{FS}}$.\n$$\n|V_{\\text{amp,FL}}| = 0.90 \\times V_{\\mathrm{FS}}\n$$\nThe ADC full-scale magnitude is given as $V_{\\mathrm{FS}} = 2.5\\ \\mathrm{V}$.\n$$\n|V_{\\text{amp,FL}}| = 0.90 \\times 2.5\\ \\mathrm{V} = 2.25\\ \\mathrm{V}\n$$\nThis setup ensures that the signal utilizes $90\\%$ of the ADC's dynamic range, leaving a margin for overshoots or drifts.\n\nNow, we can calculate the required gain $G$ of the instrumentation amplifier. The gain is the ratio of the amplifier's output voltage magnitude to its input voltage magnitude. The input to the amplifier is the bridge output, $V_{\\text{bridge,FL}}$.\n$$\nG = \\frac{|V_{\\text{amp,FL}}|}{|V_{\\text{bridge,FL}}|}\n$$\nUsing the values calculated above:\n$$\nG = \\frac{2.25\\ \\mathrm{V}}{0.01\\ \\mathrm{V}} = 225\n$$\nThe gain $G$ is a dimensionless quantity.\n\nFinally, we calculate the headroom $H$. The problem defines headroom as the remaining voltage magnitude between the ADC's full-scale limit $V_{\\mathrm{FS}}$ and the amplified full-load signal magnitude $|V_{\\text{amp,FL}}|$.\n$$\nH = V_{\\mathrm{FS}} - |V_{\\text{amp,FL}}|\n$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$\nH = 2.5\\ \\mathrm{V} - 2.25\\ \\mathrm{V} = 0.25\\ \\mathrm{V}\n$$\nThis result is consistent with the problem's mention of a \"symmetric margin of $\\pm 0.10$ of full-scale,\" as $0.10 \\times V_{\\text{FS}} = 0.10 \\times 2.5\\ \\mathrm{V} = 0.25\\ \\mathrm{V}$.\n\nThe two required quantities are the gain $G = 225$ and the headroom $H = 0.25\\ \\mathrm{V}$.",

It is a standard and well-defined problem in the domain of signal conditioning for data conversion. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem is solved by following two main steps as requested by the tasks.\n\n**1. Derivation of the aliased baseband amplitude**\n\nAn interferer signal, which is a sinusoid at frequency $f_i$, is present at the input of the anti-alias filter. Its peak amplitude is given as $A_i$. The signal can be represented as $v_{in}(t) = A_i \\cos(2\\pi f_i t + \\phi)$, where $\\phi$ is an arbitrary phase.\n\nThis signal passes through the anti-alias filter, which has a magnitude response of $|H_a(f)|$. At the specific frequency of the interferer, $f_i$, the filter's gain is $|H_a(f_i)|$. The peak amplitude of the signal at the filter's output, which is also the input to the ADC, is the original peak amplitude multiplied by the filter's gain at that frequency. Let this filtered peak amplitude be $A_{i,filt}$.\n$$A_{i,filt} = A_i |H_a(f_i)|$$\nThe problem states to assume ideal sampling, which implies that the peak amplitude of the continuous-time signal being sampled is preserved in the resulting discrete-time sequence. A continuous-time sinusoid of peak amplitude $A_{peak}$ becomes a discrete-time sinusoid of the same peak amplitude $A_{peak}$. Therefore, the peak amplitude of the aliased spur, $A_{alias}$, in the digitized baseband is equal to the peak amplitude of the signal at the ADC's input.\n$$A_{alias} = A_{i,filt}$$\nCombining these two equations gives the aliased baseband peak amplitude as a function of $A_i$ and $|H_a(f_i)|$.\n$$A_{alias} = A_i |H_a(f_i)|$$\n\n**2. Determination of the minimum required stopband attenuation**\n\nThe system requirement is that the amplitude of any aliased spur must not exceed a fraction $\\epsilon$ of the ADC's full-scale peak amplitude, $A_{FS}$. This can be expressed as an inequality:\n$$A_{alias} \\le \\epsilon A_{FS}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $A_{alias}$ from the first part:\n$$A_i |H_a(f_i)| \\le \\epsilon A_{FS}$$\nTo meet this requirement, the gain of the filter at the interferer's frequency, $|H_a(f_i)|$, must be limited. We can solve for the maximum permissible gain:\n$$|H_a(f_i)| \\le \\frac{\\epsilon A_{FS}}{A_i}$$\nThe stopband attenuation of a filter, let's call it $L_a$, is the reciprocal of its gain.\n$$L_a(f) = \\frac{1}{|H_a(f)|}$$\nTherefore, the minimum required attenuation, $L_{a,min}$, at frequency $f_i$ corresponds to the maximum allowed gain $|H_a(f_i)|$.\n$$L_{a,min}(f_i) = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon A_{FS}}{A_i}\\right)} = \\frac{A_i}{\\epsilon A_{FS}}$$\nThe problem requires this attenuation to be expressed in decibels ($\\mathrm{dB}$). The attenuation in decibels is defined as:\n$$L_{a,min}(\\mathrm{dB}) = 20 \\log_{10}(L_{a,min}(f_i)) = 20 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{A_i}{\\epsilon A_{FS}}\\right)$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values provided in the problem:\n$A_i = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n$A_{FS} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n$\\epsilon = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}$\n\n$$L_{a,min}(\\mathrm{dB}) = 20 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{0.8}{ (1.0 \\times 10^{-3}) \\cdot (1.0) }\\right)$$\n$$L_{a,min}(\\mathrm{dB}) = 20 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{0.8}{10^{-3}}\\right)$$\n$$L_{a,min}(\\mathrm{dB}) = 20 \\log_{10}(800)$$\nCalculating the value:\n$$L_{a,min}(\\mathrm{dB}) = 20 \\times 2.90308998699...$$\n$$L_{a,min}(\\mathrm{dB}) \\approx 58.0617997...\\,\\mathrm{dB}$$\nThe final answer must be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$L_{a,min}(\\mathrm{dB}) \\approx 58.06\\,\\mathrm{dB}$$\nFor completeness, we can check the aliased frequency $f_a = |f_i - kf_s| = |280\\,\\mathrm{kHz} - k \\cdot 96\\,\\mathrm{kHz}|$ must fall in the baseband $[0, f_s/2] = [0, 48\\,\\mathrm{kHz}]$.

The givens are self-consistent and sufficient to formulate and solve the problem.\n\n**Verdict**: The problem is valid. It is a well-posed, standard problem in the analysis of data acquisition systems.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe voltage across the capacitor $C_{sh}$, denoted $v_C(t)$, as it charges towards a new steady-state input voltage $v_{in}$ from an initial voltage $v_C(0)$, is described by the first-order differential equation for an RC circuit. The solution is:\n$$v_C(t) = v_{in} + (v_C(0) - v_{in}) e^{-t/\\tau}$$\nwhere the time constant $\\tau$ is given by $\\tau = R_s C_{sh}$.\n\nThe settling error, $E(t)$, is the difference between the true input voltage and the capacitor voltage at time $t$:\n$$E(t) = v_{in} - v_C(t) = v_{in} - [v_{in} + (v_C(0) - v_{in}) e^{-t/\\tau}]$$\n$$E(t) = -(v_C(0) - v_{in}) e^{-t/\\tau} = (v_{in} - v_C(0)) e^{-t/\\tau}$$\nThe term $v_{in} - v_C(0)$ is the initial error, $E(0)$. Thus, the error decays exponentially:\n$$E(t) = E(0) e^{-t/\\tau}$$\nThe problem states to consider the worst-case input transition, which is a step equal in magnitude to the full-scale range $V_{FS}$. This implies that the initial error magnitude $|E(0)|$ can be as large as $V_{FS}$. For instance, if the capacitor holds $0 \\, \\text{V}$ and the input instantaneously steps to $V_{FS}$, the initial error is $V_{FS}$.\nTherefore, the worst-case magnitude of the error at the end of the acquisition interval $t_{acq}$ is:\n$$|E(t_{acq})| = |E(0)|_{max} \\, e^{-t_{acq}/\\tau} = V_{FS} \\, e^{-t_{acq}/\\tau}$$\nThe problem requires that this residual error be within $0.5$ LSB. The LSB voltage is defined as $V_{LSB} = V_{FS} / 2^N$. The accuracy requirement is thus:\n$$|E(t_{acq})| \\le 0.5 \\, V_{LSB}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the error and the LSB:\n$$V_{FS} \\, e^{-t_{acq}/\\tau} \\le 0.5 \\left( \\frac{V_{FS}}{2^N} \\right)$$\nAssuming $V_{FS} > 0$, we can divide both sides by $V_{FS}$:\n$$e^{-t_{acq}/\\tau} \\le \\frac{0.5}{2^N} = \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 2^N} = \\frac{1}{2^{N+1}}$$\nTo solve for $\\tau$, we can take the reciprocal of both sides, which reverses the inequality:\n$$e^{t_{acq}/\\tau} \\ge 2^{N+1}$$\nNow, taking the natural logarithm of both sides (a monotonically increasing function, so the inequality is preserved):\n$$\\ln(e^{t_{acq}/\\tau}) \\ge \\ln(2^{N+1})$$\n$$\\frac{t_{acq}}{\\tau} \\ge \\ln(2^{N+1})$$\nSubstituting $\\tau = R_s C_{sh}$:\n$$\\frac{t_{acq}}{R_s C_{sh}} \\ge \\ln(2^{N+1})$$\nTo find the constraint on $R_s$, we rearrange the inequality. Since $R_s$, $C_{sh}$, and $\\ln(2^{N+1})$ are all positive quantities, the direction of the inequality is maintained during multiplication and division:\n$$t_{acq} \\ge R_s C_{sh} \\ln(2^{N+1})$$\n$$R_s \\le \\frac{t_{acq}}{C_{sh} \\ln(2^{N+1})}$$\nThis inequality represents the required constraint on the Thevenin source resistance $R_s$ to ensure the specified settling accuracy.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. $R_s \\le \\dfrac{t_{acq}}{C_{sh}\\,\\ln\\!\\left(2^{N}\\right)}$**\nThis expression would be derived if the settling error requirement was $1$ LSB, not $0.5$ LSB. The derivation would proceed as $e^{-t_{acq}/\\tau} \\le 1/2^N$, leading to $t_{acq}/\\tau \\ge \\ln(2^N)$. This does not satisfy the problem's stated accuracy requirement.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. $R_s \\le \\dfrac{t_{acq}}{C_{sh}\\,\\ln\\!\\left(2^{N+1}\\right)}$**\nThis expression exactly matches the result derived from first principles for a worst-case settling error of $0.5$ LSB for an $N$-bit ADC.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. $R_s \\le \\dfrac{t_{acq}}{C_{sh}\\,\\ln\\!\\left(2^{N+0.5}\\right)}$**\nThis expression corresponds to a settling error requirement of $1/2^{0.5}$ LSB, or approximately $0.707$ LSB. The derivation would follow from $e^{-t_{acq}/\\tau} \\le 1/2^{N+0.5}$, which is not the stated requirement.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. $R_s \\le \\dfrac{t_{acq}}{C_{sh}\\,2^{N+1}}$**\nThis expression is functionally incorrect. It results from erroneously omitting the natural logarithm function in the derivation step $\\frac{t_{acq}}{\\tau} \\ge \\ln(2^{N+1})$. A comparison of a quantity with the logarithm of another is not equivalent to a comparison with the quantity itself. This option is mathematically flawed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
