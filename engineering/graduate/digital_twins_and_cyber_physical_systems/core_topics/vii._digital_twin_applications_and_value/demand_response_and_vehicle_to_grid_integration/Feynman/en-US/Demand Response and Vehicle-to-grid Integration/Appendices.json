            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. It describes a standard problem in the simulation of cyber-physical systems, specifically the stability analysis of a numerical integration method applied to a linear time-invariant (LTI) system representing a power electronics interface. The data provided is consistent and sufficient for a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe problem consists of two parts: a qualitative explanation and a quantitative derivation.\n\nPart 1: Distinction between Fixed-Step and Variable-Step Integration for Real-Time Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL)\n\nIn the context of HIL simulation for a Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) controller, a digital twin of the power grid must execute in synchrony with a real-time clock and the physical hardware under test (the controller). This imposes a strict \"real-time constraint\": the simulation must complete each computation cycle within a predetermined time budget.\n\nFixed-step integration utilizes a constant time step, $h$, throughout the entire simulation. Each step of the numerical solver therefore requires a predictable, nearly constant amount of computation time. This determinism is paramount for HIL applications. It ensures that the simulation can reliably produce an output for the controller at each tick of the real-time clock, preventing data overruns or underruns and maintaining synchronization between the cyber (simulation) and physical (controller) components. While a fixed-step solver might be less efficient—requiring a small step size even during periods of slow dynamics to ensure stability and accuracy during fast transients—its temporal predictability is non-negotiable for real-time operation.\n\nVariable-step integration, by contrast, dynamically adjusts the time step $h$ based on an estimate of the local error at each step. The step size is reduced to maintain accuracy when the system's states are changing rapidly and increased to improve computational speed when the system is quiescent. This makes variable-step solvers highly efficient for offline (non-real-time) simulations. However, this very feature makes them unsuitable for HIL. The computational effort per step is not constant; a complex transient could force the solver to take many small, computationally intensive steps, causing the execution time for that cycle to exceed the real-time deadline. This loss of determinism would break the real-time synchronization with the hardware, rendering the HIL test invalid. Therefore, for robust HIL co-simulation of a V2G system, a fixed-step integrator is the required choice.\n\nPart 2: Derivation of the Maximum Permissible Fixed Step Size $h_{\\max}$\n\nThe small-signal dynamics of the system are described by the continuous-time LTI model:\n$$\n\\dot{x}(t) = A x(t)\n$$\nwhere the state matrix is given as $A = \\begin{pmatrix} -50  -314 \\\\ 314  -50 \\end{pmatrix}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nThe HIL solver uses an explicit forward Euler integrator. The forward Euler discretization of the differential equation is obtained by approximating the derivative $\\dot{x}(t)$ with a forward difference:\n$$\n\\frac{x(t+h) - x(t)}{h} \\approx A x(t)\n$$\nLet $x_k = x(kh)$, where $k$ is an integer index and $h$ is the fixed integration step size. The discrete-time representation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{x_{k+1} - x_k}{h} = A x_k\n$$\nRearranging this equation gives the discrete-time state-space model:\n$$\nx_{k+1} = x_k + h A x_k = (I + hA) x_k\n$$\nThis is a discrete-time LTI system of the form $x_{k+1} = A_d x_k$, where the discrete-time state transition matrix is $A_d = I + hA$.\n\nFor this discrete-time system to be asymptotically stable, all eigenvalues of its state matrix $A_d$ must lie strictly inside the unit circle in the complex plane. That is, for every eigenvalue $\\lambda_d$ of $A_d$, we must have $|\\lambda_d|  1$.\n\nThe eigenvalues of $A_d = I + hA$ are related to the eigenvalues of the continuous-time matrix $A$. If $\\lambda_A$ is an eigenvalue of $A$, then the corresponding eigenvalue of $A_d$ is $\\lambda_d = 1 + h\\lambda_A$. Thus, the stability condition for the discretized system is:\n$$\n|1 + h\\lambda_A|  1\n$$\nfor all eigenvalues $\\lambda_A$ of the matrix $A$.\n\nFirst, we must find the eigenvalues of $A$. They are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(A - \\lambda_A I) = 0$.\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} -50 - \\lambda_A  -314 \\\\ 314  -50 - \\lambda_A \\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\n$$\n(-50 - \\lambda_A)^2 - (314)(-314) = 0\n$$\n$$\n(50 + \\lambda_A)^2 + 314^2 = 0\n$$\n$$\n(50 + \\lambda_A)^2 = -314^2\n$$\nTaking the square root of both sides, where $j = \\sqrt{-1}$:\n$$\n50 + \\lambda_A = \\pm j 314\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_A = -50 \\pm j 314\n$$\nThe eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair: $\\lambda_{A,1} = -50 + j 314$ and $\\lambda_{A,2} = -50 - j 314$. The real part of both eigenvalues is $-50  0$, which confirms that the original continuous-time system is asymptotically stable.\n\nNow, we apply the stability condition. Since the magnitude $|1 + h\\lambda_A|$ will be the same for both complex conjugate eigenvalues, we only need to test one. Let's use $\\lambda_A = -50 + j 314$.\n$$\n|1 + h(-50 + j 314)|  1\n$$\n$$\n|(1 - 50h) + j(314h)|  1\n$$\nThe magnitude of a complex number $z = a+jb$ is $|z| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$. Squaring both sides of the inequality yields:\n$$\n(1 - 50h)^2 + (314h)^2  1^2\n$$\n$$\n1 - 100h + (50)^2 h^2 + (314)^2 h^2  1\n$$\n$$\n1 - 100h + 2500 h^2 + 98596 h^2  1\n$$\n$$\n1 - 100h + 101096 h^2  1\n$$\nSubtracting $1$ from both sides gives:\n$$\n-100h + 101096 h^2  0\n$$\nSince $h$ must be a positive time step ($h0$), we can divide the inequality by $h$ without changing its direction:\n$$\n-100 + 101096 h  0\n$$\n$$\n101096 h  100\n$$\n$$\nh  \\frac{100}{101096}\n$$\nThis gives the condition that the step size $h$ must satisfy. The maximum permissible step size, $h_{\\max}$, is the value at the boundary of this condition:\n$$\nh_{\\max} = \\frac{100}{101096} \\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\nh_{\\max} \\approx 0.0009891588 \\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in milliseconds ($\\mathrm{ms}$) and rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n1 \\,\\mathrm{s} = 1000 \\,\\mathrm{ms}\n$$\n$$\nh_{\\max} \\approx 0.0009891588 \\times 1000 \\,\\mathrm{ms} = 0.9891588 \\,\\mathrm{ms}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$\nh_{\\max} \\approx 0.9892 \\,\\mathrm{ms}\n$$",

Exact Discretization of the Plant**\nThe continuous-time plant is described by the linear time-invariant (LTI) system:\n$$\n\\dot{x}(t) = a\\,x(t) + b\\,u(t)\n$$\nThe control input $u(t)$ is piecewise constant, $u(t) = u_k$ for $t \\in [kh, (k+1)h)$. The solution to the state-space equation over one sampling interval, from $t=kh$ to $t=(k+1)h$, is given by:\n$$\nx((k+1)h) = \\exp(ah)x(kh) + \\int_{kh}^{(k+1)h} \\exp(a((k+1)h - \\tau))b\\,u_k\\,d\\tau\n$$\nDenoting $x_k = x(kh)$, we can evaluate the integral:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{h} \\exp(as)b\\,u_k\\,ds = b\\,u_k \\left[\\frac{\\exp(as)}{a}\\right]_0^h = \\frac{b}{a}(\\exp(ah)-1)u_k\n$$\nThus, the exact discrete-time model is:\n$$\nx_{k+1} = A_d x_k + B_d u_k\n$$\nwhere $A_d = \\exp(ah)$ and $B_d = \\frac{b}{a}(\\exp(ah)-1)$.\n\n**2. Estimation Error Dynamics**\nThe estimation error is defined as $e_k = x_k - \\hat{x}_k$. The dynamics of the error are $e_{k+1} = x_{k+1} - \\hat{x}_{k+1}$.\nThe observer model is given as:\n$$\n\\hat{x}_{k+1} = \\hat{x}_{k} + h(a\\,\\hat{x}_{k} + b\\,u_{k}) + L(y_{q,k} - \\hat{x}_{k})\n$$\nWe can rewrite this as:\n$$\n\\hat{x}_{k+1} = (1+ah-L)\\hat{x}_k + hb\\,u_k + L\\,y_{q,k}\n$$\nThe quantized measurement is $y_{q,k} = y_k + q_k = x_k + q_k$, where $|q_k| \\le \\frac{\\Delta}{2}$. Substituting this into the observer equation:\n$$\n\\hat{x}_{k+1} = (1+ah-L)\\hat{x}_k + hb\\,u_k + L(x_k + q_k)\n$$\nNow we write the expression for $e_{k+1}$:\n$$\ne_{k+1} = (A_d x_k + B_d u_k) - \\left( (1+ah-L)\\hat{x}_k + hb\\,u_k + Lx_k + Lq_k \\right)\n$$\nTo get an equation in terms of $e_k$, we substitute $\\hat{x}_k = x_k - e_k$:\n$$\ne_{k+1} = (A_d x_k + B_d u_k) - \\left( (1+ah-L)(x_k - e_k) + hb\\,u_k + Lx_k + Lq_k \\right)\n$$\n$$\ne_{k+1} = (1+ah-L)e_k + (A_d - (1+ah-L) - L)x_k + (B_d - hb)u_k - Lq_k\n$$\nSimplifying the coefficient of $x_k$:\n$$\ne_{k+1} = (1+ah-L)e_k + (A_d - 1 - ah)x_k + (B_d - hb)u_k - Lq_k\n$$\nThis is a linear system for the error $e_k$ of the form $e_{k+1} = A_e e_k + w_k$, where the error system matrix is $A_e = 1+ah-L$ and the exogenous input $w_k$ is:\n$$\nw_k = \\underbrace{(A_d - 1 - ah)x_k + (B_d - hb)u_k}_{\\text{model mismatch}} - \\underbrace{Lq_k}_{\\text{quantization error}}\n$$\n\n**3. Bounding the Exogenous Input**\nTo find the worst-case error, we must find an upper bound $W$ for $|w_k|$. Using the triangle inequality:\n$$\n|w_k| \\le |A_d - 1 - ah|\\,|x_k| + |B_d - hb|\\,|u_k| + |L|\\,|q_k|\n$$\nThe problem states that $|x(t)| \\le X_{\\max}$ and $|u(t)| \\le U_{\\max}$. This implies $|x_k| \\le X_{\\max}$ and $|u_k| \\le U_{\\max}$. We are also given $|q_k| \\le \\frac{\\Delta}{2}$.\nSubstituting these bounds, we get:\n$$\n|w_k| \\le W = |\\exp(ah) - 1 - ah|\\,X_{\\max} + \\left|\\frac{b}{a}(\\exp(ah)-1) - hb\\right|\\,U_{\\max} + |L|\\frac{\\Delta}{2}\n$$\n\n**4. Steady-State Error Bound**\nThe error dynamics are described by the recursion $|e_{k+1}| \\le |A_e|\\,|e_k| + W$. For the observer error to be bounded, the error dynamics must be stable, which requires $|A_e| = |1+ah-L|  1$. If this condition holds, as $k \\to \\infty$, the initial error's contribution vanishes, and the error magnitude $|e_k|$ reaches a steady-state bound determined by the persistent disturbance $W$. This bound, $E_{\\infty}$, is the fixed point of the recursion:\n$$\nE_{\\infty} = |A_e|E_{\\infty} + W\n$$\nSolving for $E_{\\infty}$, we get the worst-case steady-state error bound:\n$$\nE_{\\infty} = \\frac{W}{1-|A_e|} = \\frac{|\\exp(ah) - 1 - ah|\\,X_{\\max} + \\left|\\frac{b}{a}(\\exp(ah)-1) - hb\\right|\\,U_{\\max} + |L|\\frac{\\Delta}{2}}{1-|1+ah-L|}\n$$\n\n**5. Numerical Calculation**\nWe substitute the given parameter values:\n$a = -1$, $b = 1$, $h = \\frac{1}{60}$, $\\Delta = 10^{-3}$, $L = 0.98$, $X_{\\max} = 1$, $U_{\\max} = 0.5$.\n\nFirst, calculate the term in the denominator, $|A_e|$:\n$$\nA_e = 1+ah-L = 1 + (-1)\\left(\\frac{1}{60}\\right) - 0.98 = 0.02 - \\frac{1}{60} = \\frac{1}{50} - \\frac{1}{60} = \\frac{6-5}{300} = \\frac{1}{300}\n$$\nSo, $|A_e| = \\frac{1}{300}  1$, confirming stability. The denominator is $1-|A_e| = 1 - \\frac{1}{300} = \\frac{299}{300}$.\n\nNext, calculate the terms in the numerator, $W$:\nThe product $ah = (-1)(\\frac{1}{60}) = -\\frac{1}{60}$.\nThe terms $(\\exp(ah)-1-ah)$ and $(\\frac{b}{a}(\\exp(ah)-1)-hb)$ represent the errors of the forward-Euler approximation.\nFor the first term's coefficient:\n$$\n|\\exp(-1/60) - 1 - (-1/60)| = |\\exp(-1/60) - 59/60|\n$$\nSince for any $x \\neq 0$, $\\exp(x)  1+x$, for $x=-1/60$, we have $\\exp(-1/60)  1-1/60 = 59/60$. The expression inside the absolute value is positive.\nCoefficient for $X_{\\max}$: $\\exp(-1/60) - 59/60 \\approx 0.9834714655 - 0.9833333333 \\approx 1.38132 \\times 10^{-4}$.\n\nFor the second term's coefficient:\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{1}{-1}(\\exp(-1/60)-1) - \\frac{1}{60}(1)\\right| = |1 - \\exp(-1/60) - 1/60| = |\\frac{59}{60} - \\exp(-1/60)|\n$$\nThis is the same value as before.\nCoefficient for $U_{\\max}$: $\\exp(-1/60) - 59/60 \\approx 1.38132 \\times 10^{-4}$.\n\nThe model mismatch component of the bound is:\n$$\nW_m = (\\exp(-1/60) - 59/60)X_{\\max} + (\\exp(-1/60) - 59/60)U_{\\max}\n$$\n$$\nW_m = (\\exp(-1/60) - 59/60)(X_{\\max} + U_{\\max}) \\approx (1.38132 \\times 10^{-4})(1+0.5) = (1.38132 \\times 10^{-4})(1.5) \\approx 2.07198 \\times 10^{-4}\n$$\nThe quantization error component of the bound is:\n$$\nW_q = |L|\\frac{\\Delta}{2} = |0.98|\\frac{10^{-3}}{2} = 0.98 \\times 0.0005 = 4.9 \\times 10^{-4}\n$$\nThe total bound on the disturbance is:\n$$\nW = W_m + W_q \\approx 2.07198 \\times 10^{-4} + 4.9 \\times 10^{-4} = 6.97198 \\times 10^{-4}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the steady-state error bound $E_{\\infty}$:\n$$\nE_{\\infty} = \\frac{W}{1-|A_e|} \\approx \\frac{6.97198 \\times 10^{-4}}{299/300} = \\frac{(6.97198 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times 300}{299} \\approx \\frac{2.091594 \\times 10^{-1}}{299} \\approx 6.9953 \\times 10^{-4}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.0006995$.",

The minimization of a strictly convex function over a compact convex set is guaranteed to have a unique solution.\n\nNext, we specify the constraints using the provided parameters.\nThe primary constraint is the workload partitioning:\n$$\nx_v + x_d + x_c = 1 \\quad (1)\n$$\nwith non-negativity conditions:\n$$\nx_v \\ge 0, \\quad x_d \\ge 0, \\quad x_c \\ge 0 \\quad (2)\n$$\nThe privacy constraint is given by $p_{\\mathrm{priv}} = 0.7$:\n$$\nx_v + x_d \\ge 0.7 \\quad (3)\n$$\nThe bandwidth constraints depend on the parameters $S = 100$ megabits, $\\Delta t = 0.5$ seconds, $B_d = 70$ Mb/s, and $B_c = 80$ Mb/s. Let us calculate the upper bounds for $x_d$ and $x_c$:\n$$\nx_d \\le \\frac{B_d \\Delta t}{S} = \\frac{(70 \\text{ Mb/s}) \\times (0.5 \\text{ s})}{100 \\text{ Mb}} = \\frac{35}{100} = 0.35 \\quad (4)\n$$\n$$\nx_c \\le \\frac{B_c \\Delta t}{S} = \\frac{(80 \\text{ Mb/s}) \\times (0.5 \\text{ s})}{100 \\text{ Mb}} = \\frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \\quad (5)\n$$\nWe can simplify the constraint set. From constraint $(1)$, we have $x_v + x_d = 1 - x_c$. Substituting this into the privacy constraint $(3)$ gives:\n$$\n1 - x_c \\ge 0.7 \\implies x_c \\le 0.3\n$$\nThis new upper bound on $x_c$ is tighter than the one imposed by the bandwidth constraint $(5)$, i.e., $0.3  0.40$. Therefore, the effective set of constraints on the optimization variables is:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx_v + x_d + x_c = 1 \\\\\nx_v \\ge 0, \\quad x_d \\ge 0, \\quad x_c \\ge 0 \\\\\nx_d \\le 0.35 \\\\\nx_c \\le 0.3\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThis is a quadratic programming problem. A standard method for solving such problems is to use the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. A simpler approach is to first find the unconstrained minimum of the objective function subject only to the equality constraint $x_v + x_d + x_c = 1$. If this solution also satisfies all the inequality constraints, then it is the optimal solution to the full problem.\n\nLet us form the Lagrangian for the equality-constrained problem:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(x_v, x_d, x_c, \\lambda) = J(x_v, x_d, x_c) - \\lambda (x_v + x_d + x_c - 1)\n$$\nThe first-order necessary conditions for optimality are found by setting the partial derivatives of $\\mathcal{L}$ with respect to each $x_i$ to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x_i} = g_i + 2 h_i x_i - \\lambda = 0, \\quad \\text{for } i \\in \\{v, d, c\\}\n$$\nThis implies that at the optimum, the marginal costs are equalized:\n$$\ng_v + 2 h_v x_v = g_d + 2 h_d x_d = g_c + 2 h_c x_c = \\lambda\n$$\nFrom this, we can express each variable $x_i$ in terms of the Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda$:\n$$\nx_v = \\frac{\\lambda - g_v}{2 h_v}, \\quad x_d = \\frac{\\lambda - g_d}{2 h_d}, \\quad x_c = \\frac{\\lambda - g_c}{2 h_c}\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the equality constraint $x_v + x_d + x_c = 1$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\lambda - g_v}{2 h_v} + \\frac{\\lambda - g_d}{2 h_d} + \\frac{\\lambda - g_c}{2 h_c} = 1\n$$\nWe can solve for $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\lambda \\left( \\frac{1}{2 h_v} + \\frac{1}{2 h_d} + \\frac{1}{2 h_c} \\right) = 1 + \\frac{g_v}{2 h_v} + \\frac{g_d}{2 h_d} + \\frac{g_c}{2 h_c}\n$$\nPlugging in the given values:\n$$\n\\lambda \\left( \\frac{1}{2(2)} + \\frac{1}{2(3)} + \\frac{1}{2(4)} \\right) = 1 + \\frac{1.2}{2(2)} + \\frac{1.0}{2(3)} + \\frac{0.6}{2(4)}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{8} \\right) = 1 + \\frac{1.2}{4} + \\frac{1.0}{6} + \\frac{0.6}{8}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda \\left( \\frac{6+4+3}{24} \\right) = 1 + 0.3 + \\frac{1}{6} + 0.075\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda \\left( \\frac{13}{24} \\right) = 1.375 + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{11}{8} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{33+4}{24} = \\frac{37}{24}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{37}{24} \\cdot \\frac{24}{13} = \\frac{37}{13}\n$$\nNow we can compute the candidate optimal values for $x_v, x_d, x_c$:\n$$\nx_v^{\\star} = \\frac{\\frac{37}{13} - 1.2}{4} = \\frac{\\frac{37}{13} - \\frac{6}{5}}{4} = \\frac{\\frac{185 - 78}{65}}{4} = \\frac{107}{260}\n$$\n$$\nx_d^{\\star} = \\frac{\\frac{37}{13} - 1.0}{6} = \\frac{\\frac{37 - 13}{13}}{6} = \\frac{24}{13 \\times 6} = \\frac{4}{13} = \\frac{80}{260}\n$$\n$$\nx_c^{\\star} = \\frac{\\frac{37}{13} - 0.6}{8} = \\frac{\\frac{37}{13} - \\frac{3}{5}}{8} = \\frac{\\frac{185 - 39}{65}}{8} = \\frac{146}{65 \\times 8} = \\frac{146}{520} = \\frac{73}{260}\n$$\nAs a check, the sum is $x_v^{\\star} + x_d^{\\star} + x_c^{\\star} = \\frac{107+80+73}{260} = \\frac{260}{260} = 1$. The equality constraint is satisfied.\n\nFinally, we must verify if this solution satisfies all inequality constraints:\n1. Non-negativity: $x_v^{\\star} = \\frac{107}{260}  0$, $x_d^{\\star} = \\frac{80}{260}  0$, $x_c^{\\star} = \\frac{73}{260}  0$. All are satisfied.\n2. Bandwidth/Privacy constraints:\n   - For $x_d$: $x_d^{\\star} = \\frac{4}{13} \\approx 0.3077$. The constraint is $x_d \\le 0.35$. Since $0.3077  0.35$, this constraint is satisfied.\n   - For $x_c$: $x_c^{\\star} = \\frac{73}{260} \\approx 0.2808$. The effective constraint is $x_c \\le 0.3$. Since $0.2808  0.3$, this constraint is satisfied.\n\nSince the unconstrained minimum on the hyperplane $x_v+x_d+x_c=1$ lies strictly within the feasible region defined by the inequality constraints, this point is the unique global minimum for the fully constrained problem.\n\nThe problem asks for the optimal cloud fraction $x_c^{\\star}$, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nx_c^{\\star} = \\frac{73}{260} \\approx 0.28076923...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.2808$.",
