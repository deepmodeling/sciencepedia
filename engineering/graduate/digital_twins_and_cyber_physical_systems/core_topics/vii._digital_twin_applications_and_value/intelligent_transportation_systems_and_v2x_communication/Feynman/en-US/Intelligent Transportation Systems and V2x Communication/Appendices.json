            "problem": "A digital twin of a connected vehicle synchronizes its state with roadside infrastructure over Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication using a Cooperative Awareness Message (CAM). To guarantee low-latency scheduling at the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer, the twin must compute the exact length of the Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) Unaligned Packed Encoding Rules (UPER) encoding for a simplified CAM instance. The ASN.1 module for this simplified CAM is given conceptually as follows (assume no extension markers anywhere):\n\n- The CAM is a SEQUENCE with the following fields in order:\n  1. protocolVersion: INTEGER constrained to $0..3$.\n  2. messageID: INTEGER constrained to $0..15$.\n  3. stationID: INTEGER constrained to $0..262143$.\n  4. generationDeltaTime: INTEGER constrained to $0..65535$.\n  5. basicContainer: a SEQUENCE with:\n     - latitude: INTEGER constrained to $-900000000..900000000$.\n     - longitude: INTEGER constrained to $-1800000000..1800000000$.\n     - altitude: INTEGER constrained to $-10000..80000$ and marked OPTIONAL.\n  6. highFrequencyContainer: a CHOICE marked OPTIONAL with exactly three alternatives and no extension marker:\n     - noContainer: NULL,\n     - basicVehicle: a SEQUENCE with\n       - speed: INTEGER constrained to $0..16383$,\n       - heading: INTEGER constrained to $0..35999$,\n     - pedContainer: a SEQUENCE with\n       - walkingSpeed: INTEGER constrained to $0..255$.\n\nAssume Unaligned Packed Encoding Rules (UPER): no octet alignment padding within the encoding, and the presence bitmap for OPTIONAL components of a SEQUENCE is encoded before its components. For a CHOICE without an extension marker, the selected alternative index is encoded on $\\lceil \\log_{2}(n) \\rceil$ bits, where $n$ is the number of alternatives.\n\nConsider the following specific CAM instance values:\n- protocolVersion $= 2$,\n- messageID $= 2$,\n- stationID $= 54021$,\n- generationDeltaTime $= 12345$,\n- basicContainer:\n  - latitude $= -123456789$,\n  - longitude $= 987654321$,\n  - altitude is ABSENT,\n- highFrequencyContainer is PRESENT and selects basicVehicle with:\n  - speed $= 482$,\n  - heading $= 12345$.\n\nUsing only the core definitions of ASN.1 UPER for constrained whole numbers, OPTIONAL components, and CHOICE selection (as stated), construct the bit-level composition of this encoding and compute its total encoded length. Express the final result as the minimal number of bytes required to carry the UPER encoding of this CAM instance. No external envelopes (e.g., security headers) are included. Provide your answer as an exact integer in bytes. No rounding is required beyond taking the ceiling from bits to bytes. Express the final length in bytes.",
            "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent, providing all necessary definitions and data to compute a unique solution. It is a valid problem of applying the specified ASN.1 Unaligned Packed Encoding Rules (UPER) to a defined data structure.\n\nThe solution requires calculating the total number of bits for the UPER encoding of the given Cooperative Awareness Message (CAM) instance and then determining the minimal number of bytes to contain these bits. The calculation proceeds by analyzing each field of the CAM structure according to the provided encoding rules.\n\nThe core UPER encoding principles relevant to this problem are:\n1.  A constrained integer with a value $v$ in a range with lower bound `min` and upper bound `max` is encoded as the value $(v - \\text{min})$ using a minimal number of bits. The number of bits, $N$, is given by $N = \\lceil \\log_{2}(\\text{max} - \\text{min} + 1) \\rceil$. If the range size is a power of $2$, this simplifies to $N = \\log_{2}(\\text{max} - \\text{min} + 1)$.\n2.  For a `SEQUENCE` containing `OPTIONAL` components, a presence bitmap is encoded first. The bitmap has one bit for each `OPTIONAL` component. A bit value of $1$ indicates the component is present, and $0$ indicates it is absent. The values for the present components follow the bitmap.\n3.  For a `CHOICE` with $n$ alternatives and no extension marker, the selection is encoded as a zero-based index on $\\lceil \\log_{2}(n) \\rceil$ bits. This index is followed by the encoding of the selected alternative's value.\n4.  Since the encoding is unaligned, the bit fields are concatenated directly without any padding to byte boundaries.\n\nThe CAM is a `SEQUENCE` with a nested structure. We will calculate the bit length of each component in the order it would be encoded.\n\nThe top-level `CAM` `SEQUENCE` is defined with six fields, one of which is `OPTIONAL` (`highFrequencyContainer`).\n```\nCAM ::= SEQUENCE {\n  protocolVersion       INTEGER,\n  messageID             INTEGER,\n  stationID             INTEGER,\n  generationDeltaTime   INTEGER,\n  basicContainer        SEQUENCE,\n  highFrequencyContainer CHOICE OPTIONAL\n}\n```\nThus, the encoding of the `CAM` `SEQUENCE` begins with a $1$-bit presence bitmap for its single `OPTIONAL` field. The instance states `highFrequencyContainer` is `PRESENT`.\n*   Length of `CAM` presence bitmap: $1$ bit (with value $1$).\n\nNext, the mandatory fields are encoded in order.\n\n1.  **`protocolVersion`**: An `INTEGER` constrained to $0..3$.\n    *   Range size: $3 - 0 + 1 = 4$.\n    *   Number of bits: $\\lceil \\log_{2}(4) \\rceil = 2$.\n\n2.  **`messageID`**: An `INTEGER` constrained to $0..15$.\n    *   Range size: $15 - 0 + 1 = 16$.\n    *   Number of bits: $\\lceil \\log_{2}(16) \\rceil = 4$.\n\n3.  **`stationID`**: An `INTEGER` constrained to $0..262143$.\n    *   Range size: $262143 - 0 + 1 = 262144 = 2^{18}$.\n    *   Number of bits: $\\log_{2}(2^{18}) = 18$.\n\n4.  **`generationDeltaTime`**: An `INTEGER` constrained to $0..65535$.\n    *   Range size: $65535 - 0 + 1 = 65536 = 2^{16}$.\n    *   Number of bits: $\\log_{2}(2^{16}) = 16$.\n\n5.  **`basicContainer`**: A mandatory `SEQUENCE`. We must encode its value, which means applying the UPER rules to this nested `SEQUENCE`.\n    ```\n    basicContainer ::= SEQUENCE {\n      latitude   INTEGER,\n      longitude  INTEGER,\n      altitude   INTEGER OPTIONAL\n    }\n    ```\n    This `SEQUENCE` has one `OPTIONAL` field (`altitude`). Its encoding thus starts with a $1$-bit presence bitmap. The instance specifies that `altitude` is `ABSENT`.\n    *   Length of `basicContainer` presence bitmap: $1$ bit (with value $0$).\n    Now, we encode its present components.\n    *   **`latitude`**: An `INTEGER` constrained to $-900000000..900000000$.\n        *   Range size: $900000000 - (-900000000) + 1 = 1800000001$.\n        *   Number of bits: $\\lceil \\log_{2}(1800000001) \\rceil = 31$ (since $2^{30} < 1800000001 \\leq 2^{31}$).\n    *   **`longitude`**: An `INTEGER` constrained to $-1800000000..1800000000$.\n        *   Range size: $1800000000 - (-1800000000) + 1 = 3600000001$.\n        *   Number of bits: $\\lceil \\log_{2}(3600000001) \\rceil = 32$ (since $2^{31} < 3600000001 \\leq 2^{32}$).\n    *   **`altitude`**: `ABSENT`, so its encoded length is $0$ bits.\n    *   Total length for `basicContainer`: $1 + 31 + 32 + 0 = 64$ bits.\n\n6.  **`highFrequencyContainer`**: An `OPTIONAL` `CHOICE`. Its presence was already indicated by the `CAM`'s presence bitmap. Since it is `PRESENT`, we encode its value.\n    ```\n    highFrequencyContainer ::= CHOICE {\n      noContainer  NULL,\n      basicVehicle SEQUENCE,\n      pedContainer SEQUENCE\n    }\n    ```\n    This `CHOICE` has $n=3$ alternatives. The index is encoded first.\n    *   Length of `CHOICE` index: $\\lceil \\log_{2}(3) \\rceil = 2$ bits.\n    The instance selects `basicVehicle`. Assuming a zero-based index ($0$ for `noContainer`, $1$ for `basicVehicle`, $2$ for `pedContainer`), we then encode the value of the `basicVehicle` `SEQUENCE`.\n    ```\n    basicVehicle ::= SEQUENCE {\n      speed    INTEGER,\n      heading  INTEGER\n    }\n    ```\n    This `SEQUENCE` has no `OPTIONAL` fields, so there is no presence bitmap. We encode its components directly.\n    *   **`speed`**: An `INTEGER` constrained to $0..16383$.\n        *   Range size: $16383 - 0 + 1 = 16384 = 2^{14}$.\n        *   Number of bits: $\\log_{2}(2^{14}) = 14$.\n    *   **`heading`**: An `INTEGER` constrained to $0..35999$.\n        *   Range size: $35999 - 0 + 1 = 36000$.\n        *   Number of bits: $\\lceil \\log_{2}(36000) \\rceil = 16$ (since $2^{15} < 36000 \\leq 2^{16}$).\n    *   Total length for `highFrequencyContainer`: $2 + 14 + 16 = 32$ bits.\n\nNow, we sum the bit lengths of all encoded parts to find the total bit length, $L_{total}$.\n$L_{total} = (\\text{CAM bitmap}) + (\\text{protocolVersion}) + (\\text{messageID}) + (\\text{stationID}) + (\\text{generationDeltaTime}) + (\\text{basicContainer}) + (\\text{highFrequencyContainer})$\n$L_{total} = 1 + 2 + 4 + 18 + 16 + (64) + (32)$\n$L_{total} = 1 + 2 + 4 + 18 + 16 + 64 + 32 = 137$ bits.\n\nThe problem asks for the final result as the minimal number of bytes required. This is calculated by dividing the total number of bits by $8$ and taking the ceiling of the result.\nNumber of bytes = $\\lceil \\frac{L_{total}}{8} \\rceil = \\lceil \\frac{137}{8} \\rceil = \\lceil 17.125 \\rceil = 18$.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of bytes required to carry the UPER encoding of this CAM instance is $18$.",

The system becomes marginally stable when this additional phase lag at the gain crossover frequency is equal to the phase margin of the undelayed system.\n$$\\omega_{gc} \\tau_{\\max} = PM$$\nSolving for the maximum allowable delay, $\\tau_{\\max}$:\n$$\\tau_{\\max} = \\frac{PM}{\\omega_{gc}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\\tau_{\\max} \\approx \\frac{1.70748\\,\\mathrm{rad}}{1.583118\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}} \\approx 1.078556\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get $1.079\\,\\mathrm{s}$.",
