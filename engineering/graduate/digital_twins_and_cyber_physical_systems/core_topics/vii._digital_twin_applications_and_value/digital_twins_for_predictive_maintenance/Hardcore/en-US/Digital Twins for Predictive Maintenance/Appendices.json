            "problem": "A Digital Twin (DT) for a rotating machine within a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) uses a linear time-invariant continuous-time subsystem to estimate latent health states for predictive maintenance. Consider the subsystem defined by the state-space equations $\\dot{x}(t) = A x(t) + B u(t)$ with outputs $y(t) = C x(t)$, where $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, $u(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}$, and $y(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p}$. The latent state $x(t)$ includes a health variable whose accurate estimation is critical for maintenance decisions. Start from the fundamental definition of observability for linear time-invariant systems: for a known input $u(t)$ over a finite interval $[0,T]$, the initial state $x(0)$ is uniquely determined by the measured outputs $y(t)$ on $[0,T]$. Using only this definition, develop the necessary and sufficient condition for observability of the pair $(A,C)$ by relating the output and its successive time derivatives at $t=0$ to the initial state $x(0)$. Explain how this condition ensures injectivity of the mapping from $x(0)$ to the output signatures, and articulate its interpretation in the predictive maintenance context, particularly in relation to whether the health state is inferable from measured outputs.\n\nThen, for the specific DT linearization below, compute the rank of the stacked sensitivity operator formed at $t=0$ from successive time derivatives of the output up to order $n-1$ (with $n=4$).

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in linear systems theory, is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. It requests the derivation of the observability condition from first principles and its application to a concrete system, which is a standard and meaningful exercise in control engineering.\n\nWe begin by establishing the necessary and sufficient condition for observability of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. The system is described by the state-space equations:\n$$ \\dot{x}(t) = A x(t) + B u(t) $$\n$$ y(t) = C x(t) $$\nwhere $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the state vector, $u(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}$ is the input vector, and $y(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p}$ is the output vector. The matrices $A$, $B$, and $C$ are constant matrices of appropriate dimensions.\n\nThe definition of observability states that the system is observable if, for any known input $u(t)$ over a finite time interval $[0,T]$, the initial state $x(0)$ can be uniquely determined from the output history $y(t)$ over the same interval.\n\nThe solution to the state equation is given by the variation of constants formula:\n$$ x(t) = e^{At} x(0) + \\int_{0}^{t} e^{A(t-\\tau)} B u(\\tau) d\\tau $$\nSubstituting this into the output equation yields:\n$$ y(t) = C e^{At} x(0) + C \\int_{0}^{t} e^{A(t-\\tau)} B u(\\tau) d\\tau $$\nTo determine the initial state $x(0)$, we can rearrange this equation:\n$$ y(t) - C \\int_{0}^{t} e^{A(t-\\tau)} B u(\\tau) d\\tau = C e^{At} x(0) $$\nSince the input $u(t)$ is known, the integral term on the left-hand side is a known function of time. Let's denote the left-hand side as $\\tilde{y}(t)$. The problem of determining $x(0)$ from $y(t)$ and $u(t)$ is equivalent to determining $x(0)$ from $\\tilde{y}(t)$, where $\\tilde{y}(t) = C e^{At} x(0)$. This is the response of the system with the input set to zero. Therefore, the observability of the pair $(A,C)$ depends only on the matrices $A$ and $C$ and is independent of the matrix $B$.\n\nThe problem directs us to use successive time derivatives of the output at $t=0$. Let's consider the system with $u(t)=0$ without loss of generality for the purpose of determining $x(0)$.\nThe output is $y(t) = C x(t)$.\nThe first time derivative of the output is:\n$$ \\dot{y}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(C x(t)) = C \\dot{x}(t) = C (A x(t)) = C A x(t) $$\nThe second time derivative is:\n$$ \\ddot{y}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(C A x(t)) = C A \\dot{x}(t) = C A (A x(t)) = C A^2 x(t) $$\nContinuing this process, the $k$-th derivative of the output is:\n$$ y^{(k)}(t) = C A^k x(t) $$\nNow, we evaluate these derivatives at the initial time $t=0$:\n$$ y(0) = C x(0) $$\n$$ \\dot{y}(0) = C A x(0) $$\n$$ \\ddot{y}(0) = C A^2 x(0) $$\n$$ \\vdots $$\n$$ y^{(n-1)}(0) = C A^{n-1} x(0) $$\nWe consider derivatives up to order $n-1$, where $n$ is the dimension of the state space. By the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, any power of $A$ of order $n$ or higher can be expressed as a linear combination of powers of $A$ from $0$ to $n-1$. Thus, derivatives of order $n$ or higher will not provide new linearly independent information about $x(0)$.\n\nWe can stack these $n$ vector equations into a single matrix equation:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} y(0) \\\\ \\dot{y}(0) \\\\ \\ddot{y}(0) \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y^{(n-1)}(0) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} C \\\\ CA \\\\ CA^2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ CA^{n-1} \\end{pmatrix} x(0) $$\nLet $Y_0$ be the column vector of stacked output derivatives on the left-hand side, and let $\\mathcal{O}$ be the matrix on the right-hand side, known as the observability matrix. This is the \"stacked sensitivity operator\" mentioned in the problem, as it relates the initial state $x(0)$ to the output signature $Y_0$.\nThe equation is $Y_0 = \\mathcal{O} x(0)$.\n\nFor the initial state $x(0)$ to be uniquely determined from the vector $Y_0$, the linear map represented by the matrix $\\mathcal{O}$ must be injective. An injective linear map has a null space (or kernel) containing only the zero vector. This means that if $\\mathcal{O}z = 0$, then it must follow that $z=0$. For a matrix, this property is equivalent to its columns being linearly independent. The matrix $\\mathcal{O}$ has dimensions $(np) \\times n$. For its columns to be linearly independent, the matrix must have full column rank. Therefore, the necessary and sufficient condition for observability is:\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\mathcal{O}) = n $$\nwhere $\\mathcal{O} = \\begin{pmatrix} C \\\\ CA \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ CA^{n-1} \\end{pmatrix}$. This is the Kalman rank condition for observability.\n\nIn the context of predictive maintenance for a rotating machine, the state vector $x(t)$ represents the physical state of the machine, including variables such as position, velocity, and importantly, latent health indicators (e.g., bearing wear, shaft imbalance). The output vector $y(t)$ represents the sensor measurements (e.g., vibration, temperature). The condition $\\text{rank}(\\mathcal{O}) = n$ ensures that every component of the state vector, including the unmeasurable health variables, has a unique effect on the sequence of measured outputs. If the system is observable, the Digital Twin can, in principle, perfectly reconstruct the initial health state $x(0)$ from the sensor data signature, and by extension, the entire state trajectory $x(t)$. If the system were not observable, certain health degradation modes would be \"invisible\" to the sensors, preventing the DT from making accurate maintenance predictions.\n\nNow, we apply this condition to the specific system provided.\nThe state dimension is $n=4$. The matrices are:\n$$ A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ -0.8 & -0.5 & -0.3 & -0.1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad C = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe must compute the observability matrix $\\mathcal{O}$ and its rank.\n$$ \\mathcal{O} = \\begin{pmatrix} C \\\\ CA \\\\ CA^2 \\\\ CA^3 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe components are calculated as follows:\n$C = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$CA = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ (This is the first row of $A$)\n$CA^2 = (CA)A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ (This is the second row of $A$)\n$CA^3 = (CA^2)A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ (This is the third row of $A$)\n\nAssembling the observability matrix $\\mathcal{O}$:\n$$ \\mathcal{O} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis is the $4 \\times 4$ identity matrix, $I_4$.\nThe rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows or columns. The identity matrix $I_4$ has $4$ linearly independent columns.\nTherefore, the rank of the observability matrix is:\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\mathcal{O}) = \\text{rank}(I_4) = 4 $$\nSince the rank of $\\mathcal{O}$ is $4$, which is equal to the state dimension $n=4$, the system is completely observable.\n\nConclusion on health estimability: Because the system is observable, it is possible to uniquely determine the initial state vector $x(0)$ from the measurements. This implies that all latent states, including any representing the machine's health, can be inferred from the sensor outputs. The Digital Twin based on this linearized model would be capable of successfully estimating the health of the rotating machine, forming a valid basis for a predictive maintenance strategy.",

            "problem": "A digital twin for predictive maintenance estimates a scalar health index that drifts due to gradual wear. The health dynamics and sensing are modeled as a linear Gaussian state-space system: the latent health state $x_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}$ evolves according to $x_{t+1} = x_{t} + w_{t}$ and the sensor produces $y_{t} = x_{t} + v_{t}$, where the process noise $w_{t} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,Q)$ and the measurement noise $v_{t} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,R)$ are mutually independent, independent over time, and independent of the initial state, with $Q > 0$ and $R > 0$ known.

No numerical evaluation is required, and no units are needed. The final answer must be a single analytic expression.",
            "solution": "The problem is first validated against the specified criteria.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- The latent health state $x_t \\in \\mathbb{R}$ evolves according to the process model: $x_{t+1} = x_{t} + w_{t}$.\n- The sensor measurement $y_t$ is given by the measurement model: $y_{t} = x_{t} + v_{t}$.\n- The process noise is a zero-mean Gaussian random variable: $w_{t} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,Q)$, with variance $Q > 0$.\n- The measurement noise is a zero-mean Gaussian random variable: $v_{t} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,R)$, with variance $R > 0$.\n- The noise processes $w_t$ and $v_t$ are mutually independent, independent over time, and independent of the initial state.\n- The objective is to find the optimal linear minimum mean-square error estimator in steady state.\n- It is assumed that the steady-state limit of the error covariance exists and is finite.\n- The task is to derive the steady-state Kalman gain $K$ as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $Q$ and $R$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem describes a scalar linear Gaussian state-space model, a fundamental construct in estimation theory and control systems. The derivation of the steady-state Kalman filter is a standard and well-established procedure based on rigorous mathematical principles of probability and optimization. The application context of a digital twin for predictive maintenance is a modern and scientifically valid use of such models. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. The system is described by a standard random walk process with noisy measurements. For such a system where the process noise covariance $Q$ and measurement noise covariance $R$ are positive, the discrete-time algebraic Riccati equation associated with the Kalman filter has a unique, positive-definite (positive, in this scalar case) stabilizing solution. The problem explicitly assumes this steady-state limit exists, ensuring a unique solution can be found.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, and unambiguous mathematical language. Terms like \"linear minimum mean-square error,\" \"error covariance,\" and \"Kalman gain\" have precise definitions in the field.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, with all necessary information provided for a unique solution. The derivation process can proceed.\n\n**Derivation of the Steady-State Kalman Gain**\n\nThe system is a linear time-invariant state-space model:\n$$x_{t+1} = F x_{t} + w_{t}$$\n$$y_{t} = H x_{t} + v_{t}$$\nFrom the problem statement, we have a scalar system where the state transition matrix is $F=1$ and the observation matrix is $H=1$. The noise covariances are the scalars $Q$ and $R$.\n\nThe Kalman filter recursively computes the state estimate by a two-step process: prediction and update. The error covariances associated with these steps are central to the filter's performance. Let $P_{t|t-1}$ be the predicted (a priori) error covariance and $P_{t|t}$ be the updated (a posteriori) error covariance.\n\nThe standard Kalman filter equations for the error covariances are:\n1.  **Prediction:** $P_{t|t-1} = F P_{t-1|t-1} F^T + Q$\n2.  **Update:** $P_{t|t} = (I - K_t H) P_{t|t-1}$\n\nThe Kalman gain $K_t$ is chosen to minimize the mean-square error, and is given by:\n$$K_t = P_{t|t-1} H^T (H P_{t|t-1} H^T + R)^{-1}$$\n\nFor our specific scalar case ($F=1$, $H=1$), these equations simplify to:\n1.  **Prediction:** $P_{t|t-1} = P_{t-1|t-1} + Q$\n2.  **Kalman Gain:** $K_t = P_{t|t-1} (P_{t|t-1} + R)^{-1} = \\frac{P_{t|t-1}}{P_{t|t-1} + R}$\n3.  **Update:** $P_{t|t} = (1 - K_t) P_{t|t-1}$\n\nWe can combine these to derive the discrete-time Riccati equation, which describes the propagation of the error covariance. Substituting the expression for $K_t$ into the update equation for $P_{t|t}$:\n$$P_{t|t} = \\left(1 - \\frac{P_{t|t-1}}{P_{t|t-1} + R}\\right) P_{t|t-1} = \\left(\\frac{P_{t|t-1} + R - P_{t|t-1}}{P_{t|t-1} + R}\\right) P_{t|t-1} = \\frac{R P_{t|t-1}}{P_{t|t-1} + R}$$\nNow, we substitute the prediction equation $P_{t|t-1} = P_{t-1|t-1} + Q$ into this result:\n$$P_{t|t} = \\frac{R (P_{t-1|t-1} + Q)}{P_{t-1|t-1} + Q + R}$$\nThis is the recursive relation for the a posteriori error covariance.\n\nIn steady state, the error covariance becomes constant. We define the steady-state a posteriori error covariance as $P = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} P_{t|t}$. Thus, in the limit, $P_{t|t} = P_{t-1|t-1} = P$. The Riccati equation becomes the discrete-time algebraic Riccati equation (DARE):\n$$P = \\frac{R (P + Q)}{P + Q + R}$$\nTo solve for $P$, we rearrange this algebraic equation:\n$$P(P + Q + R) = R(P + Q)$$\n$$P^2 + PQ + PR = RP + RQ$$\n$$P^2 + PQ - RQ = 0$$\nThis is a quadratic equation in $P$ of the form $aP^2 + bP + c = 0$, with $a=1$, $b=Q$, and $c=-RQ$. Using the quadratic formula, $P = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$P = \\frac{-Q \\pm \\sqrt{Q^2 - 4(1)(-RQ)}}{2} = \\frac{-Q \\pm \\sqrt{Q^2 + 4QR}}{2}$$\nSince $P$ represents a variance, it must be non-negative ($P \\ge 0$). Given that $Q > 0$ and $R > 0$, we have $\\sqrt{Q^2 + 4QR} > \\sqrt{Q^2} = Q$. Therefore, the root with the minus sign, $-Q - \\sqrt{Q^2 + 4QR}$, is negative and must be discarded as non-physical. The only valid solution is:\n$$P = \\frac{-Q + \\sqrt{Q^2 + 4QR}}{2}$$\nNow we must find the steady-state Kalman gain, $K = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} K_t$. We can use the relationships derived earlier. An elegant approach is to first establish a direct link between $P$ and $K$.\nFrom the gain equation, $K_t = \\frac{P_{t|t-1}}{P_{t|t-1} + R}$, we have $K_t(P_{t|t-1} + R) = P_{t|t-1}$, which rearranges to $P_{t|t-1}(1 - K_t) = K_t R$.\nFrom the update equation, $P_{t|t} = (1 - K_t)P_{t|t-1}$.\nComparing these two expressions, we find a simple relationship:\n$$P_{t|t} = K_t R$$\nIn steady state, this becomes $P = KR$.\n\nWe can now substitute $P = KR$ into the quadratic equation we found for $P$:\n$$P^2 + QP - RQ = 0$$\n$$(KR)^2 + Q(KR) - RQ = 0$$\n$$K^2 R^2 + KQR - QR = 0$$\nSince $R > 0$, we can divide the entire equation by $R$:\n$$R K^2 + Q K - Q = 0$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for the steady-state gain $K$. We solve for $K$ using the quadratic formula, with $a=R$, $b=Q$, $c=-Q$:\n$$K = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{-Q \\pm \\sqrt{Q^2 - 4(R)(-Q)}}{2R}$$\n$$K = \\frac{-Q \\pm \\sqrt{Q^2 + 4QR}}{2R}$$\nThe Kalman gain $K_t$ must be in the range $[0, 1]$. In our case, since $P_{t|t-1} > 0$ and $R > 0$, $K_t = \\frac{P_{t|t-1}}{P_{t|t-1} + R}$ is strictly in $(0, 1)$, so the steady-state gain $K$ must also be positive. As before, the term $\\sqrt{Q^2 + 4QR}$ is greater than $Q$, so the negative root yields a negative value for $K$, which is physically invalid. Therefore, we must choose the positive root:\n$$K = \\frac{-Q + \\sqrt{Q^2 + 4QR}}{2R}$$\nThis expression for $K$ is the required closed-form solution in terms of $Q$ and $R$.",

We use the derived expression for $R(t)$:\n$$\nR(t_{\\eta}) = \\exp\\!\\left(-\\left(\\frac{t_{\\eta}}{\\lambda}\\right)^{k}\\right)\n$$\nFrom the previous step, we have an expression for the term $t_{\\eta}/\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\frac{t_{\\eta}}{\\lambda} = \\left(\\frac{\\eta \\lambda}{k}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{k-1}}\n$$\nWe raise this expression to the power of $k$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{t_{\\eta}}{\\lambda}\\right)^{k} = \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\eta \\lambda}{k}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{k-1}} \\right]^k = \\left(\\frac{\\eta \\lambda}{k}\\right)^{\\frac{k}{k-1}}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the reliability function:\n$$\nR(t_{\\eta}) = \\exp\\!\\left( - \\left(\\frac{\\eta \\lambda}{k}\\right)^{\\frac{k}{k-1}} \\right)\n$$\nThis provides the closed-form symbolic expressions for both $t_{\\eta}$ and $R(t_{\\eta})$.\n\nTask 3: Interpretation of the shape parameter $k$.\n\nThe behavior of the hazard function $h(t) = \\frac{k}{\\lambda}(\\frac{t}{\\lambda})^{k-1}$ is determined by the sign of the exponent $k-1$.\n- Case $k < 1$: In this case, the exponent $k-1$ is negative. Thus, $h(t)$ is a decreasing function of time $t$ for $t > 0$. This models \"infant mortality\" or early-life failures. The risk of failure is highest at the beginning and decreases as the component operates. This implies that if an asset survives its initial period, it becomes more reliable. For maintenance policy, this suggests that age-based preventive replacement is counterproductive; a burn-in period might be beneficial, and other maintenance strategies (e.g., corrective maintenance upon failure) are more appropriate.\n- Case $k = 1$: The exponent $k-1$ is zero. The hazard function becomes constant: $h(t) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}(\\frac{t}{\\lambda})^{0} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}$. This corresponds to the exponential distribution. The risk of failure is constant over time, indicating that failures are random and memoryless. The asset does not \"age\" in terms of failure risk. For maintenance policy, this means that preventive replacement at a fixed age offers no advantage over replacement upon failure, as an old component is no more likely to fail in the next hour than a new one.\n- Case $k > 1$: The exponent $k-1$ is positive. Thus, $h(t)$ is an increasing function of time $t$. This models failures due to aging and wear-out, which is common for mechanical components. The risk of failure increases with operational age. For maintenance policy, this is the classic scenario where predictive and preventive maintenance are most effective. A hazard-threshold policy is justified because it allows for component replacement before the risk of failure becomes unacceptably high, thereby optimizing the trade-off between utilizing the full life of a component and avoiding costly in-service failures.",
