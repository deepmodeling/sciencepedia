            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on standard principles of graph theory applied to Systems Engineering (SE) traceability, a formal and established practice. All definitions and data required for a unique solution are provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe problem requires the analysis of a directed graph $G = (V, E)$. The set of vertices is given by $V = \\{R1, R2, \\mathrm{DesignA}, \\mathrm{CodeB}, \\mathrm{TestC}\\}$. The set of directed edges is $E = \\{(R1, \\mathrm{DesignA}), (\\mathrm{DesignA}, \\mathrm{CodeB}), (R1, \\mathrm{TestC}), (R2, \\mathrm{TestC})\\}$. We will compute the required quantities step-by-step.\n\nFirst, we compute the forward reachability set $F(R1)$ and the backward reachability set $B(R1)$ for the vertex $R1$.\n\nThe forward reachability set $F(x)$ is defined as the set of all vertices $v \\in V$ for which there exists a directed path from $x$ to $v$, excluding $x$ itself. To find $F(R1)$, we identify all paths starting from $R1$.\n- There is a directed edge $(R1, \\mathrm{DesignA})$, which is a path of length $1$. Thus, $\\mathrm{DesignA} \\in F(R1)$.\n- There is a directed edge $(R1, \\mathrm{TestC})$, which is a path of length $1$. Thus, $\\mathrm{TestC} \\in F(R1)$.\n- There is a path of length $2$ from $R1$ to $\\mathrm{CodeB}$: $R1 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{DesignA} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{CodeB}$. Thus, $\\mathrm{CodeB} \\in F(R1)$.\nNo other vertices are reachable from $R1$. Therefore, the forward reachability set is $F(R1) = \\{\\mathrm{DesignA}, \\mathrm{CodeB}, \\mathrm{TestC}\\}$.\n\nThe backward reachability set $B(x)$ is defined as the set of all vertices $u \\in V$ for which there exists a directed path from $u$ to $x$, excluding $x$ itself. To find $B(R1)$, we identify all paths ending at $R1$. By inspecting the edge set $E$, we observe that there are no edges of the form $(u, R1)$ for any $u \\in V$. The in-degree of vertex $R1$ is $0$. Consequently, there are no paths from any other vertex to $R1$. The backward reachability set is therefore the empty set, $B(R1) = \\emptyset$.\n\nNext, we compute the sum $S = |F(R1)| + |B(R1)|$.\nThe cardinality of a set is the number of elements it contains.\n$|F(R1)| = |\\mathrm{ \\{\\mathrm{DesignA}, \\mathrm{CodeB}, \\mathrm{TestC}\\}} | = 3$.\n$|B(R1)| = |\\emptyset| = 0$.\nThe sum is $S = 3 + 0 = 3$.\n\nThen, we compute the missing verification count $M$. The definition states that $M$ is the cardinality of the set of code artifacts in $F(R1)$ that do not have any directed path to any test artifact in $V$.\nFirst, we identify the code artifacts in $F(R1)$. The set is $F(R1) = \\{\\mathrm{DesignA}, \\mathrm{CodeB}, \\mathrm{TestC}\\}$. From the problem statement, $\\mathrm{CodeB}$ is the only code artifact. So, the set of code artifacts in $F(R1)$ is $\\{\\mathrm{CodeB}\\}$.\nSecond, we identify the test artifacts in $V$. From the problem statement, $\\mathrm{TestC}$ is the only test artifact. The set of test artifacts is $\\{\\mathrm{TestC}\\}$.\nThird, we check if the code artifact $\\mathrm{CodeB}$ has a directed path to the test artifact $\\mathrm{TestC}$. By inspecting the graph edges $E$, we see there are no edges originating from $\\mathrm{CodeB}$. The out-degree of $\\mathrm{CodeB}$ is $0$. Therefore, there is no directed path from $\\mathrm{CodeB}$ to any other vertex, including $\\mathrm{TestC}$.\nThe set of code artifacts in $F(R1)$ that do not have a directed path to a test artifact is $\\{\\mathrm{CodeB}\\}$.\nThe missing verification count $M$ is the cardinality of this set: $M = |\\{\\mathrm{CodeB}\\}| = 1$.\n\nFinally, we compute the value $V = S + M$.\nWe found $S = 3$ and $M = 1$.\nTherefore, $V = 3 + 1 = 4$.",

No percentage sign is allowed in the reported number.",
            "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   **Requirement**: The true packet loss probability is at most $p \\le 0.02$.\n-   **Monitoring window size**: $n = 1000$ packets.\n-   **Model**: $n$ independent and identically distributed Bernoulli trials.\n-   **Loss indicator**: $Y_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n-   **Probability of loss**: $\\Pr(Y_i = 1) = p$.\n-   **Observed data**: $x = 15$ losses in the window.\n-   **Methodology**: Derive an approximate one-sided $95\\%$ confidence upper bound for $p$ using the Central Limit Theorem and the normal approximation to the Bernoulli/Binomial distribution.\n-   **Compliance decision rule**: The requirement is deemed satisfied at confidence level $0.95$ if the upper bound is at most $0.02$.\n-   **Output requirement**: Report the one-sided $95\\%$ confidence upper bound for $p$ as a decimal number, rounded to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n-   **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is well-grounded in standard statistical theory. The use of Bernoulli trials to model packet loss, the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) for large-sample approximation, and the construction of confidence intervals are fundamental techniques in statistical inference and engineering reliability.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data ($n$, $x$, confidence level) and specifies the theoretical approach (CLT, normal approximation) to find a unique numerical answer.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free of subjective or ambiguous terms.\n-   **Consistency check**: The normal approximation to the binomial distribution is appropriate when both $np$ and $n(1-p)$ are sufficiently large, typically greater than $5$. Using the sample estimate $\\hat{p} = x/n = 15/1000 = 0.015$, we find $n\\hat{p} = 1000 \\times 0.015 = 15$ and $n(1-\\hat{p}) = 1000 \\times (1 - 0.015) = 985$. Both values are substantially greater than $5$, validating the use of the normal approximation.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the calculation of a one-sided upper confidence bound for a population proportion $p$ based on a sample.\n\nLet $X$ be the total number of observed packet losses in a sample of $n$ packets. The sequence of packet transmissions is modeled as $n$ independent and identically distributed Bernoulli trials. Therefore, $X$ follows a binomial distribution, $X \\sim B(n, p)$, where $p$ is the true, unknown packet loss probability.\n\nThe point estimator for $p$ is the sample proportion, denoted by $\\hat{p}$:\n$$ \\hat{p} = \\frac{X}{n} $$\nThe expected value of this estimator is $E[\\hat{p}] = p$, and its variance is $\\text{Var}(\\hat{p}) = \\frac{p(1-p)}{n}$.\n\nAccording to the Central Limit Theorem, for a sufficiently large sample size $n$, the sampling distribution of $\\hat{p}$ can be approximated by a normal distribution:\n$$ \\hat{p} \\approx N\\left(p, \\frac{p(1-p)}{n}\\right) $$\nThis implies that the standardized random variable $Z$ is approximately a standard normal random variable, $Z \\sim N(0, 1)$:\n$$ Z = \\frac{\\hat{p} - p}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}} $$\nTo construct a one-sided $100(1-\\alpha)\\%$ confidence interval for $p$, we seek an upper bound $p_{upper}$ such that $\\Pr(p \\le p_{upper}) = 1-\\alpha$. This is equivalent to finding the set of values of $p$ that are not statistically rejected by the observed data. We start with the probability statement for a one-sided interval:\n$$ \\Pr\\left( \\frac{\\hat{p} - p}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}} > -z_{1-\\alpha} \\right) = 1-\\alpha $$\nwhere $z_{1-\\alpha}$ is the $(1-\\alpha)$-quantile of the standard normal distribution. For a $95\\%$ confidence level, $1-\\alpha = 0.95$, so $\\alpha = 0.05$. The critical value is $z_{0.95}$, which is approximately $1.645$.\n\nThe standard error term in the denominator, $\\sqrt{p(1-p)/n}$, depends on the unknown parameter $p$. A common and direct application of the normal approximation, as suggested by the problem, is to substitute the estimator $\\hat{p}$ for $p$ in the standard error term. This gives the estimated standard error, $SE(\\hat{p})$:\n$$ SE(\\hat{p}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}} $$\nThe confidence interval is then constructed from the relationship:\n$$ \\frac{\\hat{p} - p}{SE(\\hat{p})} > -z_{1-\\alpha} $$\nRearranging this inequality to solve for $p$ yields the upper bound:\n$$ \\hat{p} - p > -z_{1-\\alpha} \\times SE(\\hat{p}) $$\n$$ p < \\hat{p} + z_{1-\\alpha} \\times SE(\\hat{p}) $$\nThus, the one-sided upper confidence bound, $p_{upper}$, is given by the formula:\n$$ p_{upper} = \\hat{p} + z_{1-\\alpha} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}} $$\nNow, we substitute the provided values into this formula.\n-   Sample size, $n = 1000$.\n-   Number of losses, $x = 15$.\n-   Confidence level, $1-\\alpha = 0.95$, which gives $z_{0.95} \\approx 1.64485...$. We will use the common value $z_{0.95} = 1.645$.\n\nFirst, calculate the sample proportion $\\hat{p}$:\n$$ \\hat{p} = \\frac{15}{1000} = 0.015 $$\nNext, calculate the upper bound $p_{upper}$:\n$$ p_{upper} = 0.015 + 1.645 \\sqrt{\\frac{0.015(1 - 0.015)}{1000}} $$\n$$ p_{upper} = 0.015 + 1.645 \\sqrt{\\frac{0.015 \\times 0.985}{1000}} $$\n$$ p_{upper} = 0.015 + 1.645 \\sqrt{\\frac{0.014775}{1000}} $$\n$$ p_{upper} = 0.015 + 1.645 \\sqrt{0.000014775} $$\n$$ p_{upper} = 0.015 + 1.645 \\times 0.0038438262... $$\n$$ p_{upper} = 0.015 + 0.0063230941... $$\n$$ p_{upper} = 0.0213230941... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first significant figure is the $2$ in the hundredths place. The fourth significant figure is the second $2$ in the ten-thousandths place. The following digit is $3$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\n$$ p_{upper} \\approx 0.02132 $$\nThis upper bound is the answer. As part of the reasoning process, we can now apply the traceability rule. The requirement is $p \\le 0.02$. Since our calculated upper bound at $95\\%$ confidence is $p_{upper} \\approx 0.02132$, which is greater than $0.02$, we conclude that the system does not meet the specified reliability requirement at this confidence level. This demonstrates the traceability of the operational data back to the formal requirement.",
