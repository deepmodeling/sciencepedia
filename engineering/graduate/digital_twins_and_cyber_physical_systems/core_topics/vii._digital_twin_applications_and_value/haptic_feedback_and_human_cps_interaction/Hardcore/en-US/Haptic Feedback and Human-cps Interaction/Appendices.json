            "problem": "A human operator interacts with a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) through a grounded haptic interface whose Digital Twin (DT) models contact with a virtual wall as a linear compliant element. The virtual contact model is defined by the constitutive relation $F=K x$, where $F$ is the contact force, $K$ is the stiffness, and $x$ is the penetration depth into the virtual wall. Consider an effective end-effector lumped mass $M$ approaching the wall with initial velocity $v$ and making first contact at $t=0$ with zero initial penetration. Assume the following idealizations: frictionless normal contact, no damping or time delay, rigid environment except the modeled compliance, and the haptic controller renders the virtual stiffness passively.

The model $F=Kx$ is Hooke's Law. This is a standard and valid representation for a compliant contact in physics and engineering.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is a well-posed initial value problem for a second-order linear ordinary differential equation.

The provided data are consistent with each other and are sufficient for finding a solution. The idealizations are explicitly stated and serve to define the boundaries of the physical model.\n- **Realism:** The numerical values for mass, velocity, and stiffness are physically plausible for a haptic interaction scenario.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and complete. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Equation of Motion**\nThe interaction is modeled as a mass moving against a linear spring. During contact, the only force acting on the mass $M$ is the restoring force from the virtual wall, which opposes the penetration. According to Newton's second law, the sum of forces equals mass times acceleration, $F_{net} = Ma$. The acceleration is the second time derivative of the penetration depth, $a = \\ddot{x}$. The restoring force is $F = -Kx$.\n\nTherefore, the equation of motion is:\n$$M\\ddot{x} = -Kx$$\nRearranging this gives the standard form of the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator:\n$$M\\ddot{x} + Kx = 0$$\nDividing by $M$, we get:\n$$\\ddot{x} + \\frac{K}{M}x = 0$$\nThis is often written as $\\ddot{x} + \\omega^2 x = 0$, where $\\omega$ is the natural angular frequency of the system, defined as:\n$$\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{K}{M}}$$\nThe general solution for this differential equation is of the form $x(t) = A \\cos(\\omega t) + B \\sin(\\omega t)$. To find the specific solution, we apply the initial conditions.\nAt $t=0$, the penetration is zero: $x(0)=0$.\n$$x(0) = A \\cos(0) + B \\sin(0) = A \\cdot 1 + B \\cdot 0 = A$$\nThus, $A=0$. The solution simplifies to $x(t) = B \\sin(\\omega t)$.\n\nNext, we use the initial velocity condition. The velocity is the first time derivative of position: $\\dot{x}(t) = B \\omega \\cos(\\omega t)$.\nAt $t=0$, the velocity is $v$: $\\dot{x}(0)=v$.\n$$\\dot{x}(0) = B \\omega \\cos(0) = B \\omega \\cdot 1 = B \\omega$$\nThus, $B \\omega = v$, which gives $B = \\frac{v}{\\omega}$.\nSubstituting $B$ back into the solution for $x(t)$, the motion of the mass during contact is described by:\n$$x(t) = \\frac{v}{\\omega} \\sin(\\omega t)$$\n\n**Determination of Maximum Penetration and Peak Force**\nThe problem requires the use of the work-energy principle. This principle provides a direct path to finding the maximum penetration $x_{\\max}$ without needing to solve the full time-dependent motion. The work-energy theorem states that the work done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy. In this conservative system (no friction, no damping), this is equivalent to the principle of conservation of mechanical energy.\n\nTotal initial energy at $t=0$ (the moment of contact):\nThe kinetic energy is $E_{k,i} = \\frac{1}{2}Mv^2$.\nThe potential energy stored in the virtual spring is $E_{p,i} = \\frac{1}{2}Kx(0)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}K(0)^2 = 0$.\nSo, the total initial energy is $E_{total} = E_{k,i} + E_{p,i} = \\frac{1}{2}Mv^2$.\n\nTotal final energy at maximum penetration $x_{\\max}$:\nAt the point of maximum penetration, the mass momentarily comes to a stop before reversing direction. Therefore, its velocity is $0$, and its final kinetic energy is $E_{k,f} = 0$.\nAll the initial kinetic energy has been converted into potential energy stored in the virtual spring: $E_{p,f} = \\frac{1}{2}Kx_{\\max}^2$.\nThe total final energy is $E_{total} = E_{k,f} + E_{p,f} = \\frac{1}{2}Kx_{\\max}^2$.\n\nBy the principle of conservation of energy:\n$$E_{initial} = E_{final}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2}Mv^2 = \\frac{1}{2}Kx_{\\max}^2$$\nSolving for $x_{\\max}$:\n$$Mv^2 = Kx_{\\max}^2$$\n$$x_{\\max}^2 = \\frac{Mv^2}{K}$$\n$$x_{\\max} = \\sqrt{\\frac{Mv^2}{K}} = v\\sqrt{\\frac{M}{K}}$$\n\nThe peak contact force, $F_{\\max}$, occurs at the maximum penetration depth, $x_{\\max}$, according to the constitutive relation $F=Kx$.\n$$F_{\\max} = Kx_{\\max}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $x_{\\max}$:\n$$F_{\\max} = K \\left( v\\sqrt{\\frac{M}{K}} \\right) = v\\sqrt{K^2 \\frac{M}{K}} = v\\sqrt{MK}$$\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\nThe given parameters are:\n- $M = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- $v = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$\n- $K = 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the maximum penetration depth $x_{\\max}$:\n$$x_{\\max} = (0.5\\,\\mathrm{m/s}) \\sqrt{\\frac{0.1\\,\\mathrm{kg}}{10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{N/m}}} = 0.5 \\sqrt{\\frac{10^{-1}}{10^5}} = 0.5 \\sqrt{10^{-6}}\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\n$$x_{\\max} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 0.0005\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\nRounded to four significant figures, this is $5.000 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the peak contact force $F_{\\max}$:\n$$F_{\\max} = Kx_{\\max} = (10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{N/m})(0.0005\\,\\mathrm{m})$$\n$$F_{\\max} = 10^5 \\times 5 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{N} = 5 \\times 10^1\\,\\mathrm{N} = 50\\,\\mathrm{N}$$\nRounded to four significant figures, this is $50.00\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n\nThe final answers are $x_{\\max} = 5.000 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$ and $F_{\\max} = 50.00\\,\\mathrm{N}$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the perceived aliased frequency of a sampled sinusoidal signal and its classification into a human mechanoreceptor channel. This is a problem of signal sampling and aliasing, governed by the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem.\n\nThe problem begins with the definitions of a continuous-time sinusoidal signal, $x(t)$, and its sampled counterpart, $x[n]$:\n$$x(t) = A \\cos(2\\pi f_{0} t)$$\n$$x[n] = x\\left(\\frac{n}{f_{s}}\\right) = A \\cos\\left(2\\pi \\frac{f_{0}}{f_{s}} n\\right)$$\nwhere $f_0$ is the original signal frequency and $f_s$ is the sampling frequency.

This baseband in the physical frequency domain corresponds to a discrete-time angular frequency range of $[0, \\pi]$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the discrete-time angular frequency $\\Omega_0$ using the given values $f_0 = 600\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ and $f_s = 1\\,\\mathrm{kHz} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n$$\\Omega_0 = 2\\pi \\frac{600}{1000} = 2\\pi (0.6) = 1.2\\pi \\text{ radians/sample}$$\nThe Nyquist frequency is $f_s/2 = 1000/2 = 500\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. Since $f_0 = 600\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ is greater than the Nyquist frequency, aliasing will occur.\n\nIn discrete-time systems, due to the periodic nature of the complex exponential basis functions (or sinusoidal functions), frequencies are only unique within an interval of length $2\\pi$. Any two angular frequencies $\\Omega_1$ and $\\Omega_2$ are considered equivalent if $\\Omega_1 = \\Omega_2 + 2\\pi k$ for any integer $k$. The standard interval for the principal alias is $(-\\pi, \\pi]$. Furthermore, for real-valued signals, the cosine function is even, meaning $\\cos(\\theta) = \\cos(-\\theta)$. Consequently, a negative frequency $-\\Omega$ is indistinguishable from its positive counterpart $\\Omega$. This is why the perceptual baseband is specified as $[0, f_s/2]$, which corresponds to the discrete-time angular frequency range $[0, \\pi]$.\n\nOur calculated frequency $\\Omega_0 = 1.2\\pi$ lies outside the principal alias range $(-\\pi, \\pi]$.
