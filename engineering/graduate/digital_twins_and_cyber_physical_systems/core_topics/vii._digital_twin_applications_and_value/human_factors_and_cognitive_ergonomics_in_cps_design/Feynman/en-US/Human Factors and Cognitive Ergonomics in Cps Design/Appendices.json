According to the given Shannon-form of Fitts' law:\n$$\nMT_1 = a + b \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{2A}{W}\\right)\n$$\nWhen the target width $W$ is scaled by a positive factor $s$, the new width is $sW$. The new movement time, $MT_2$, is given by:\n$$\nMT_2 = a + b \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{2A}{sW}\\right)\n$$\nThe change in movement time, $\\Delta MT$, is the difference between the new movement time and the initial movement time:\n$$\n\\Delta MT = MT_2 - MT_1\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $MT_1$ and $MT_2$:\n$$\n\\Delta MT = \\left[a + b \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{2A}{sW}\\right)\\right] - \\left[a + b \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{2A}{W}\\right)\\right]\n$$\nThe intercept term $a$ cancels out:\n$$\n\\Delta MT = b \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{2A}{sW}\\right) - b \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{2A}{W}\\right)\n$$\nFactoring out the slope term $b$:\n$$\n\\Delta MT = b \\left[ \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{2A}{sW}\\right) - \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{2A}{W}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms, $\\log_{c}(x) - \\log_{c}(y) = \\log_{c}\\left(\\frac{x}{y}\\right)$, we can combine the two logarithmic terms:\n$$\n\\Delta MT = b \\log_{2}\\left( \\frac{\\frac{2A}{sW}}{\\frac{2A}{W}} \\right)\n$$\nSimplifying the fraction inside the logarithm:\n$$\n\\frac{\\frac{2A}{sW}}{\\frac{2A}{W}} = \\frac{2A}{sW} \\cdot \\frac{W}{2A} = \\frac{1}{s}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\Delta MT$:\n$$\n\\Delta MT = b \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{s}\\right)\n$$\nUsing another property of logarithms, $\\log_{c}\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = -\\log_{c}(x)$, we arrive at the final closed-form symbolic expression for the change in movement time:\n$$\n\\Delta MT = -b \\log_{2}(s)\n$$\n\nPart 2: Evaluation of the absolute reduction in movement time.\n\nThe problem states that the target width doubles from $W = 20$ px to $W' = 40$ px. The scaling factor $s$ is the ratio of the new width to the initial width:\n$$\ns = \\frac{W'}{W} = \\frac{40}{20} = 2\n$$\nThe given value for the slope coefficient is $b = 100$ ms. We can now substitute these values into the derived expression for $\\Delta MT$:\n$$\n\\Delta MT = -(100) \\log_{2}(2)\n$$\nBy the definition of the base-$2$ logarithm, $\\log_{2}(2) = 1$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\Delta MT = -(100) \\times 1 = -100 \\text{ ms}\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the movement time has decreased, which is a reduction. The problem asks for the absolute reduction in movement time, which is the magnitude of this change:\n$$\n|\\Delta MT| = |-100| = 100 \\text{ ms}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. To express the exact integer $100$ with four significant figures, we write it as $100.0$.\nThe absolute reduction in movement time is therefore $100.0$ ms. Note that this result depends only on the scaling factor $s$ and the coefficient $b$, and is independent of the amplitude $A$ and the initial width $W$, as demonstrated by the symbolic derivation.",

The problem is complete, consistent, and does not violate any scientific principles. It is a formalizable and solvable problem relevant to engineering and human factors.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution is derived in four parts: first, determining the decision threshold $k$; second, determining the sensitivity $d'$; third, calculating the decision criterion $c$; and fourth, evaluating the optimality of the criterion to find $s$.\n\nLet $\\Phi(z)$ be the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution, $\\mathcal{N}(0,1)$, and let $\\Phi^{-1}(p)$ be its inverse, the quantile function.\n\n**Part 1: Determination of the decision threshold $k$**\n\nThe false alarm rate $F$ is the probability of deciding \"anomaly\" when the state is \"no anomaly\". The decision variable $x$ is drawn from $X_N \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$.\n$$F = P(X_N \\ge k)$$\nSince $X_N$ follows a standard normal distribution, this can be written in terms of its CDF, $\\Phi(z)$:\n$$F = 1 - P(X_N  k) = 1 - \\Phi(k)$$\nWe are given $F = 0.2$. Substituting this value:\n$$0.2 = 1 - \\Phi(k)$$\n$$\\Phi(k) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8$$\nThe threshold $k$ is therefore the z-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of $0.8$:\n$$k = \\Phi^{-1}(0.8)$$\nUsing a standard normal table or a computational tool, we find $k \\approx 0.8416212$.\n\n**Part 2: Determination of the sensitivity $d'$**\n\nThe hit rate $H$ is the probability of deciding \"anomaly\" when the state is \"anomaly\". The decision variable $x$ is drawn from $X_S \\sim \\mathcal{N}(d',1)$.\n$$H = P(X_S \\ge k)$$\nTo use the standard normal CDF, we standardize the variable $X_S$. Let $Z = X_S - d'$. Then $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$.\n$$H = P(X_S - d' \\ge k - d') = P(Z \\ge k - d')$$\n$$H = 1 - \\Phi(k - d')$$\nWe are given $H = 0.8$. Substituting this value:\n$$0.8 = 1 - \\Phi(k - d')$$\n$$\\Phi(k - d') = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2$$\n$$k - d' = \\Phi^{-1}(0.2)$$\nThe standard normal distribution is symmetric about $0$, so its quantile function has the property $\\Phi^{-1}(p) = -\\Phi^{-1}(1-p)$. Applying this property:\n$$\\Phi^{-1}(0.2) = -\\Phi^{-1}(1 - 0.2) = -\\Phi^{-1}(0.8)$$\nSubstituting this back into the equation for $k-d'$:\n$$k - d' = -\\Phi^{-1}(0.8)$$\nFrom Part 1, we know that $k = \\Phi^{-1}(0.8)$. We can therefore substitute $k$ into the right side of the equation:\n$$k - d' = -k$$\n$$2k = d'$$\nNow we can compute the value of $d'$:\n$$d' = 2 \\Phi^{-1}(0.8) \\approx 2 \\times 0.8416212 = 1.6832424$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we get:\n$$d' \\approx 1.683$$\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of the decision criterion $c$**\n\nThe decision criterion $c$ is defined as the position of the threshold $k$ relative to the midpoint of the two distribution means ($\\mu_N=0$ and $\\mu_S=d'$). The midpoint is $\\frac{0+d'}{2} = \\frac{d'}{2}$.\nThe definition is given as:\n$$c = k - \\frac{d'}{2}$$\nFrom the result in Part 2, we have the exact relationship $d' = 2k$. Substituting this into the definition of $c$:\n$$c = k - \\frac{2k}{2} = k - k = 0$$\nThe decision criterion $c$ is exactly $0$.\n\n**Part 4: Evaluation of optimality and determination of $s$**\n\nAccording to Bayesian decision theory, the optimal decision threshold $k_{opt}$ minimizes expected loss. For the given conditions (equal priors and equal costs for misses and false alarms), the optimal decision rule is to decide \"anomaly\" if the likelihood of an anomaly is greater than or equal to the likelihood of no anomaly. The threshold is set at the point where the likelihoods are equal.\nThe optimal threshold $k_{opt}$ is the value of $x$ where the probability density functions are equal:\n$$f_S(x) = f_N(x)$$\n$$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x - d')^2}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2}\\right)$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides and simplifying:\n$$-\\frac{(x - d')^2}{2} = -\\frac{x^2}{2}$$\n$$(x - d')^2 = x^2$$\n$$x^2 - 2d'x + (d')^2 = x^2$$\n$$-2d'x + (d')^2 = 0$$\n$$d'(d' - 2x) = 0$$\nSince $d' \\ne 0$ (because $H \\ne F$), we must have $d' - 2x = 0$.\n$$k_{opt} = x = \\frac{d'}{2}$$\nThe operator's actual threshold is $k = \\Phi^{-1}(0.8)$. From Part 2, we know $k = d'/2$.\nTherefore, the operator's threshold $k$ is identical to the optimal threshold $k_{opt}$.\n$$k = k_{opt}$$\nThe decision strategy is optimal.\n\nThe problem defines the optimality evaluation code $s$ as follows:\n-   $s=1$ (conservative): The operator sets a threshold $k  k_{opt}$. This corresponds to $c = k - d'/2  0$.\n-   $s=0$ (optimal): The operator sets a threshold $k = k_{opt}$. This corresponds to $c = k - d'/2 = 0$.\n-   $s=-1$ (liberal): The operator sets a threshold $k  k_{opt}$. This corresponds to $c = k - d'/2  0$.\n\nSince we found the operator's criterion to be $c=0$, the criterion is optimal. Thus, the value for $s$ is:\n$$s = 0$$\n\nSummarizing the results:\n-   $d' \\approx 1.683$\n-   $c = 0$\n-   $s = 0$\nThese are to be expressed as a row matrix.",

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to find the value of the automation allocation variable $a$, denoted $a^{\\star}$, within the interval $[0,1]$ that minimizes the total expected harm per task, $E[H(a)]$.\n\nThe total expected harm per task is the sum of the expected harm from non-catastrophic errors and the expected harm from catastrophic failures. Following the principle of expected value, this is given by:\n$$E[H(a)] = p_{\\mathrm{nc}}(a) s_{e} + p_{\\mathrm{cat}}(a) s_{c}$$\nSubstituting the given models for the probabilities:\n$$E[H(a)] = \\left( (1-a)p_{h} + a p_{a} \\right) s_{e} + (p_{\\mathrm{cat}} a^{2}) s_{c}$$\nThis is the objective function to be minimized.
