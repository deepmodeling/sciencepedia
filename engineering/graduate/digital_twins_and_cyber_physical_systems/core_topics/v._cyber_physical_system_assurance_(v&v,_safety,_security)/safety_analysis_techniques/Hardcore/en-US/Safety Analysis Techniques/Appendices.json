            "problem": "A cyber-physical system with a Digital Twin is used to supervise an autonomous vehicle’s motion planning. The safety case requires demonstrating that the Digital Twin prevents hazardous miscontrol except when multiple barriers fail. Consider the safety analysis using Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), contrasted with other techniques such as Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment (HARA), Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA), and Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA). The top failure event $T$ is “hazardous miscontrol escapes the Digital Twin’s safety envelope.” The fault tree has two levels of $\\land/\\lor$ gates and is defined over the basic failure events $A_{1}$, $A_{2}$, $B_{1}$, $B_{2}$, and $B_{3}$ as follows:\n$$\nT \\equiv (A_{1} \\land A_{2}) \\lor \\big((B_{1} \\lor B_{2}) \\land B_{3}\\big).\n$$\nInterpretation of basic failure events:\n- $A_{1}$: Digital Twin model mismatch not detected.\n- $A_{2}$: Sensor fusion miscalibration.\n- $B_{1}$: Anomaly detector false negative on trajectory instability.\n- $B_{2}$: Runtime monitor threshold mis-set under environmental drift.\n- $B_{3}$: Safety interlock actuator fails to engage.\n\nAll basic events are assumed mutually independent.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), a standard safety and reliability engineering methodology. It is well-posed, with a clear logical definition of the top failure event, specified probabilities for all basic events, and a stated assumption of mutual independence. The problem is objective, formally specified, and admits a unique, verifiable solution. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe analysis is structured into three parts as requested: derivation of minimal cut sets and minimal path sets, computation of the top event probability, and a qualitative discussion of system vulnerabilities.\n\n### 1. Minimal Cut Sets (MCS) and Minimal Path Sets (MPS)\n\nWe begin with formal definitions based on set theory and Boolean logic. A fault tree represents a logical function $\\phi(x_1, ..., x_n)$ where the output is $1$ (failure) if the top event $T$ occurs, and $0$ (success) otherwise. The inputs $x_i$ represent the state of basic events, where $x_i=1$ if basic event $E_i$ occurs and $x_i=0$ if it does not.\n\nA **cut set** is a set of basic events whose concurrent occurrence causes the top event to occur. A **minimal cut set (MCS)** is a cut set such that, if any basic event is removed from the set, it is no longer a cut set. In Boolean terms, an MCS corresponds to a prime implicant of the structure function $\\phi$, representing a minimal conjunction of basic events that implies the top event.\n\nA **path set** is a set of basic events whose concurrent non-occurrence ensures the top event does not occur. A **minimal path set (MPS)** is a path set such that, if any basic event is removed from the set, it is no longer a path set. In Boolean terms, an MPS corresponds to a prime implicant of the dual (or success) function $\\bar{\\phi}$, representing a minimal conjunction of non-failing components (negated basic events) that implies system success (negation of the top event).\n\nThe given logical structure for the top event $T$ is:\n$$T \\equiv (A_{1} \\land A_{2}) \\lor \\big((B_{1} \\lor B_{2}) \\land B_{3}\\big)$$\n\n**Derivation of Minimal Cut Sets (MCS):**\nTo find the MCS, we expand the Boolean expression into a disjunctive normal form (a sum of products), where each product term represents a cut set. We then eliminate any non-minimal sets.\n\nApplying the distributive law $X \\land (Y \\lor Z) \\equiv (X \\land Y) \\lor (X \\land Z)$ to the second term:\n$$(B_{1} \\lor B_{2}) \\land B_{3} \\equiv (B_{1} \\land B_{3}) \\lor (B_{2} \\land B_{3})$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $T$:\n$$T \\equiv (A_{1} \\land A_{2}) \\lor (B_{1} \\land B_{3}) \\lor (B_{2} \\land B_{3})$$\nThis expression is a disjunction of three conjunctions. Each conjunction represents a cut set:\n- Cut Set 1: $\\{A_{1}, A_{2}\\}$\n- Cut Set 2: $\\{B_{1}, B_{3}\\}$\n- Cut Set 3: $\\{B_{2}, B_{3}\\}$\n\nTo confirm they are minimal, we check if any set is a superset of another. No set contains another. For instance, $\\{A_{1}, A_{2}\\}$ is not a superset of $\\{B_{1}, B_{3}\\}$ or $\\{B_{2}, B_{3}\\}$, and vice versa. Each set is also internally minimal, as removing any event from any set would invalidate the corresponding conjunction.\nThus, the minimal cut sets are $\\{A_{1}, A_{2}\\}$, $\\{B_{1}, B_{3}\\}$, and $\\{B_{2}, B_{3}\\}$.\n\n**Derivation of Minimal Path Sets (MPS):**\nTo find the MPS, we first find the Boolean expression for the non-occurrence of $T$, denoted $\\bar{T}$, by applying De Morgan's laws. The MPS correspond to the prime implicants of this new expression. Let $\\bar{E}$ denote the non-occurrence of event $E$.\n$$\\bar{T} \\equiv \\neg T \\equiv \\neg \\Big( (A_{1} \\land A_{2}) \\lor \\big((B_{1} \\lor B_{2}) \\land B_{3}\\big) \\Big)$$\nApplying De Morgan's law $\\neg(X \\lor Y) \\equiv \\neg X \\land \\neg Y$:\n$$\\bar{T} \\equiv \\neg(A_{1} \\land A_{2}) \\land \\neg\\big((B_{1} \\lor B_{2}) \\land B_{3}\\big)$$\nApplying De Morgan's laws again, $\\neg(X \\land Y) \\equiv \\neg X \\lor \\neg Y$ and $\\neg(X \\lor Y) \\equiv \\neg X \\land \\neg Y$:\n$$\\bar{T} \\equiv (\\neg A_{1} \\lor \\neg A_{2}) \\land \\big(\\neg(B_{1} \\lor B_{2}) \\lor \\neg B_{3}\\big)$$\n$$\\bar{T} \\equiv (\\bar{A}_{1} \\lor \\bar{A}_{2}) \\land ((\\bar{B}_{1} \\land \\bar{B}_{2}) \\lor \\bar{B}_{3})$$\nTo obtain a sum-of-products form for $\\bar{T}$, we apply the distributive law $(X \\lor Y) \\land (Z \\lor W) \\equiv (X \\land Z) \\lor (X \\land W) \\lor (Y \\land Z) \\lor (Y \\land W)$:\n$$\\bar{T} \\equiv (\\bar{A}_{1} \\land (\\bar{B}_{1} \\land \\bar{B}_{2})) \\lor (\\bar{A}_{1} \\land \\bar{B}_{3}) \\lor (\\bar{A}_{2} \\land (\\bar{B}_{1} \\land \\bar{B}_{2})) \\lor (\\bar{A}_{2} \\land \\bar{B}_{3})$$\nThis gives the following path sets:\n- Path Set 1: $\\{\\bar{A}_{1}, \\bar{B}_{1}, \\bar{B}_{2}\\}$\n- Path Set 2: $\\{\\bar{A}_{1}, \\bar{B}_{3}\\}$\n- Path Set 3: $\\{\\bar{A}_{2}, \\bar{B}_{1}, \\bar{B}_{2}\\}$\n- Path Set 4: $\\{\\bar{A}_{2}, \\bar{B}_{3}\\}$\nNo set is a superset of another. Therefore, these are the minimal path sets.\n\n### 2. Computation of $\\mathbb{P}(T)$\n\nWe compute the exact probability of the top event, $\\mathbb{P}(T)$, using the principle of inclusion-exclusion and the mutual independence of all basic events. It is most direct to work from the original structure of $T$. Let $I_1 = A_1 \\land A_2$ and $I_2 = (B_1 \\lor B_2) \\land B_3$. Then $T = I_1 \\lor I_2$.\nThe probability of a union is given by:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(T) = \\mathbb{P}(I_1 \\lor I_2) = \\mathbb{P}(I_1) + \\mathbb{P}(I_2) - \\mathbb{P}(I_1 \\land I_2)$$\nThe event $I_1$ depends only on the set of basic events $\\{A_1, A_2\\}$, while $I_2$ depends only on $\\{B_1, B_2, B_3\\}$. Since all basic events are mutually independent, the events $I_1$ and $I_2$ are independent. Therefore, $\\mathbb{P}(I_1 \\land I_2) = \\mathbb{P}(I_1) \\mathbb{P}(I_2)$.\nThe formula simplifies to:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(T) = \\mathbb{P}(I_1) + \\mathbb{P}(I_2) - \\mathbb{P}(I_1)\\mathbb{P}(I_2)$$\nLet us denote the probabilities of the basic events as $p_{A1} = \\mathbb{P}(A_1)$, $p_{A2} = \\mathbb{P}(A_2)$, and so on.\n\nFirst, we calculate $\\mathbb{P}(I_1)$:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(I_1) = \\mathbb{P}(A_1 \\land A_2) = p_{A1} p_{A2} \\quad (\\text{due to independence})$$\nNext, we calculate $\\mathbb{P}(I_2)$:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(I_2) = \\mathbb{P}((B_1 \\lor B_2) \\land B_3)$$\nSince $B_3$ is independent of $B_1$ and $B_2$, it is independent of the event $(B_1 \\lor B_2)$.\n$$\\mathbb{P}(I_2) = \\mathbb{P}(B_1 \\lor B_2) \\mathbb{P}(B_3)$$\nThe probability $\\mathbb{P}(B_1 \\lor B_2)$ is given by the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(B_1 \\lor B_2) = \\mathbb{P}(B_1) + \\mathbb{P}(B_2) - \\mathbb{P}(B_1 \\land B_2) = p_{B1} + p_{B2} - p_{B1}p_{B2}$$\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(I_2) = (p_{B1} + p_{B2} - p_{B1}p_{B2}) p_{B3}$$\nNow, we substitute the numeric values:\n$p_{A1} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-3}$, $p_{A2} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-4}$, $p_{B1} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3}$, $p_{B2} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}$, $p_{B3} = 4.0 \\times 10^{-4}$.\n\nCalculating $\\mathbb{P}(I_1)$:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(I_1) = (2.0 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-4}) = 10.0 \\times 10^{-7} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}$$\nCalculating $\\mathbb{P}(I_2)$:\n$$p_{B1} + p_{B2} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3} + 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-3}$$\n$$p_{B1}p_{B2} = (1.5 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-3}) = 1.5 \\times 10^{-6}$$\n$$\\mathbb{P}(B_1 \\lor B_2) = 2.5 \\times 10^{-3} - 1.5 \\times 10^{-6} = 0.0025 - 0.0000015 = 0.0024985 = 2.4985 \\times 10^{-3}$$\n$$\\mathbb{P}(I_2) = (2.4985 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times (4.0 \\times 10^{-4}) = 9.994 \\times 10^{-7}$$\nFinally, we calculate $\\mathbb{P}(T)$:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(T) = \\mathbb{P}(I_1) + \\mathbb{P}(I_2) - \\mathbb{P}(I_1)\\mathbb{P}(I_2)$$\n$$\\mathbb{P}(T) = (1.0 \\times 10^{-6}) + (9.994 \\times 10^{-7}) - (1.0 \\times 10^{-6})(9.994 \\times 10^{-7})$$\n$$\\mathbb{P}(T) = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6} + 0.9994 \\times 10^{-6} - 9.994 \\times 10^{-13}$$\n$$\\mathbb{P}(T) = 1.9994 \\times 10^{-6} - 0.0000009994 \\times 10^{-6}$$\n$$\\mathbb{P}(T) = 1.9993990006 \\times 10^{-6}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $1.999 \\times 10^{-6}$.\n\n### 3. Qualitative Vulnerability Insights\n\nThe minimal cut sets (MCS) and minimal path sets (MPS) provide profound insights into the system's vulnerabilities and safety assurance paths without requiring numerical calculation.\n\n- **MCS Insights ($\\{A_{1}, A_{2}\\}$, $\\{B_{1}, B_{3}\\}$, $\\{B_{2}, B_{3}\\}$)**:\n  The MCSs identify the smallest combinations of failures leading to hazardous miscontrol. All MCSs are of order $2$, which means there are no single-point failures for the top event; at least two independent failures are required. This indicates a baseline level of fault tolerance.\n  The event $B_{3}$ (\"Safety interlock actuator fails\") is a critical vulnerability. It is present in two of the three MCSs, making it a common cause of failure across different scenarios. Its failure renders the system vulnerable to a single additional failure in either of the runtime monitoring subsystems ($B_1$ or $B_2$). Consequently, the reliability and integrity of the actuator are paramount for system safety.\n  The system has two distinct macro-vulnerabilities: one related to the Digital Twin's perception and modeling ($A_1, A_2$) and another related to the runtime monitoring and actuation ($B_1, B_2, B_3$).\n\n- **MPS Insights ($\\{\\bar{A}_{1}, \\bar{B}_{3}\\}$, $\\{\\bar{A}_{2}, \\bar{B}_{3}\\}$, $\\{\\bar{A}_{1}, \\bar{B}_{1}, \\bar{B}_{2}\\}$, $\\{\\bar{A}_{2}, \\bar{B}_{1}, \\bar{B}_{2}\\}$)**:\n  The MPSs reveal the minimal conditions for guaranteed safety. The presence of two short path sets of order $2$, $\\{\\bar{A}_{1}, \\bar{B}_{3}\\}$ and $\\{\\bar{A}_{2}, \\bar{B}_{3}\\}$, again emphasizes the importance of component $B_3$. If the safety interlock actuator is guaranteed to work ($\\bar{B}_{3}$), system safety is assured provided at least one of the core Digital Twin functions (model matching or sensor fusion) is also working correctly.\n  Conversely, if component $B_3$ fails, safety is no longer guaranteed by any single component's success. In this case, safety relies on the remaining path structures: safety is maintained only if $(\\bar{A}_1 \\lor \\bar{A}_2)$ AND $(\\bar{B}_1 \\land \\bar{B}_2)$ are true. This means that upon actuator failure, safety depends on BOTH anomaly detectors working correctly in conjunction with at least one primary DT function.\n  Collectively, the MCS and MPS structures unequivocally identify the safety interlock actuator ($B_3$) as the most critical component in this safety architecture.",

            "problem": "You are given a formalized Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment (HARA) task for a cyber-physical system: an autonomous quadrotor drone represented by a digital twin. The digital twin includes a time series of environmental wind speed data synthesized from deterministic parameters. The goal is to compute the exposure metric for gust-induced instability and derive a numeric Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL) index using a principled, monotone mapping from severity, exposure, and controllability, all grounded in probabilistic definitions and basic mechanics.\n\nThe fundamental base for this task is comprised of the following well-tested principles:\n- Probability as long-run frequency: if a condition occurs for $n$ samples in a total of $N$ time samples, the empirical probability is $p = n/N$.\n- Kinetic energy is given by $E_{\\text{kin}} = \\tfrac{1}{2} m v^2$.\n- A hazard exposure can be modeled by the fraction of time that an environmental variable exceeds a stability limit, provided the system is operating.\n\nDefinitions to be used:\n1. The wind speed time series is synthesized as $w_i = B + A \\sin\\left( 2\\pi i / P \\right)$ for samples $i = 0, 1, \\dots, N-1$, where $B$ is the baseline wind speed in $\\mathrm{m/s}$, $A$ is the gust amplitude in $\\mathrm{m/s}$, $P$ is the discrete period in samples, and $N$ is the number of samples. Use $N = 1000$ and $P = 100$, with a constant sampling interval $\\Delta t = 1\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n2. The drone is considered to be in a gust-induced instability condition at sample $i$ if $w_i \\ge T$, where $T$ is a wind speed stability threshold in $\\mathrm{m/s}$. The exposure fraction is $p = n/N$, where $n$ is the count of samples satisfying $w_i \\ge T$.\n3. Exposure category $E_{\\ell}$ is determined from $p$ by:\n   - $E_0$ if $p = 0$,\n   - $E_1$ if $0  p \\le 10^{-3}$,\n   - $E_2$ if $10^{-3}  p \\le 10^{-2}$,\n   - $E_3$ if $10^{-2}  p \\le 10^{-1}$,\n   - $E_4$ if $10^{-1}  p \\le 1$.\n   Encode $E_{\\ell}$ by an integer $e \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$ such that $E_{\\ell} \\mapsto e = \\ell$.\n4. Controllability category $C_k$ is determined by a controllability probability parameter $q \\in [0,1]$, which represents the probability that the pilot or autonomy can successfully regain stable control given an instability.

Map $R$ to a numeric ASIL index $a \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$ by the following conservative thresholds that preserve monotonicity in $s$, $e$, and $\\tilde{c}$:\n   - If $R = 0$, then $a = 0$,\n   - If $1 \\le R \\le 3$, then $a = 1$,\n   - If $4 \\le R \\le 7$, then $a = 2$,\n   - If $8 \\le R \\le 17$, then $a = 3$,\n   - If $R \\ge 18$, then $a = 4$.\n   Here $a = 0$ corresponds to Quality Management (QM) and $a \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$ correspond to Automotive Safety Integrity Levels A, B, C, and D respectively.

Severity (S) Calculation**\n\nThe severity of a hazard is determined by the kinetic energy of the drone at cruise conditions. The kinetic energy, $E_{\\text{kin}}$, is given by the formula:\n$$ E_{\\text{kin}} = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 $$\nThe problem provides the drone's mass, $m = 2\\,\\mathrm{kg}$, and cruise speed, $v = 15\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$.

The corresponding integer encoding is $s = 3$. This value is constant for all test cases.\n\n**2. Per-Case Analysis**\n\nFor each test case, defined by a parameter set $(B, A, T, q)$, we compute the exposure fraction $p$, its corresponding category integer $e$, the controllability category integer $c$, the risk index $R$, and the final ASIL index $a$. The total number of samples is $N = 1000$ and the wind-speed period is $P = 100$ samples.\n\nThe wind speed at each sample $i$ is given by:\n$$ w_i = B + A \\sin\\left( \\frac{2\\pi i}{P} \\right) $$\nAn instability condition occurs if $w_i \\ge T$. The exposure fraction $p$ is the ratio of the number of samples $n$ where this condition is met to the total number of samples $N$.\n\n**Test Case 1:** $(B=8, A=5, T=12, q=0.92)$\n- **Exposure ($p_1, e_1$):**\n  The instability condition is $8 + 5 \\sin(2\\pi i / 100) \\ge 12$, which simplifies to $\\sin(2\\pi i / 100) \\ge 0.8$. We count the number of integer samples $i \\in [0, 999]$ that satisfy this. Over one period of $100$ samples, this inequality holds for $i \\in [15, 35]$. This constitutes $35 - 15 + 1 = 21$ samples per period. Since there are $N/P = 1000/100 = 10$ periods in the time series, the total count is $n_1 = 21 \\times 10 = 210$.\n  The exposure fraction is $p_1 = n_1 / N = 210 / 1000 = 0.21$.\n  According to the thresholds, $p_1 > 10^{-1}$, which falls into category $E_4$. Thus, $e_1 = 4$.\n- **Controllability ($c_1$):**\n  The controllability parameter is $q_1 = 0.92$. This satisfies $0 \\le q_1  0.95$, placing it in category $C_3$.

Over $10$ periods, the total count is $n_4 = 7 \\times 10 = 70$.\n  The exposure fraction is $p_4 = 70 / 1000 = 0.07$.\n  The value $p_4=0.07$ satisfies $10^{-2}  p_4 \\le 10^{-1}$, so the category is $E_3$.

            "problem": "A cyber-physical autonomous guided vehicle is supervised by a cloud-based Digital Twin (DT) that executes periodic health diagnostics on the braking actuator. A Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment (HARA) identifies the hazardous event \"loss of braking force leading to collision.\" A Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) assigns a baseline occurrence rate $O$ for the hazardous failure mode of the actuator, and a Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) yields the same quantitative hazardous event rate when composing minimal cut sets. A System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) confirms that timely detection and mitigation can prevent the unsafe control action if detection occurs early enough within the hazard exposure window.\n\nAssume the following scientifically grounded model:\n- The hazardous failure initiations follow a homogeneous Poisson process with baseline hazardous event rate $O$ (failures per hour) in the absence of diagnostics.\n- The DT performs diagnostic checks periodically every $T$ seconds. Each check independently detects the hazardous actuator failure, if present, with true positive probability $q$ (constant over time).\n- After detection, a mitigation is executed, requiring a fixed mitigation time $t_{m}$ seconds before the hazard is averted.\n- If no successful detection and mitigation occur before a fixed hazard exposure window of length $W$ seconds after failure initiation elapses, the hazardous event occurs.\n- The phase (residual time) from a failure initiation to the next diagnostic check is uniformly distributed on $[0, T)$ due to the independence of Poisson arrivals and periodic sampling.\n\nStarting from the core definitions of occurrence rate for a Poisson process, diagnostic detection probability, and the expectation over the random residual phase within periodic sampling, derive an analytic expression for the effective diagnostic coverage $DC_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ as the expected fraction of hazardous initiations that are detected and mitigated within the exposure window. Then, derive the adjusted occurrence rate $O'$ under the assumption that detected-and-mitigated initiations do not result in hazardous events and that detection outcomes across checks are independent.\n\nUse the following quantitatively specified parameters obtained from the safety analyses:\n- Baseline occurrence rate $O = 2.6 \\times 10^{-5}$ failures per hour.\n- Diagnostic period $T = 10$ seconds.\n- Per-check true positive probability $q = 0.91$.\n- Mitigation time $t_{m} = 2$ seconds.\n- Hazard exposure window $W = 25$ seconds.\n\nExpress the final adjusted occurrence rate $O'$ in failures per hour. Round your answer to four significant figures.\n\nIn your derivation, explicitly state any assumptions needed to connect the analyses in Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment (HARA), Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), and System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) to the probabilistic model above, and discuss limitations of this model in capturing real-world diagnostic coverage in cyber-physical systems.",
            "solution": "The baseline occurrence rate $O$ is defined as the rate (in failures per hour) at which hazardous initiations occur in the absence of diagnostics, consistent with the homogeneous Poisson process assumption. Under periodic diagnostics and probabilistic detection, the effective diagnostic coverage $DC_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is defined as the expected fraction of hazardous initiations that are detected and mitigated within the exposure window, thereby not producing a hazardous event.\n\nWe assume:\n1. Hazardous initiations follow a homogeneous Poisson process with rate $O$.\n2. The Digital Twin (DT) diagnostic checks occur periodically every $T$ seconds, with independent and identically distributed per-check true positive probability $q$ when the failure is present.\n3. Upon successful detection, mitigation completes after a fixed time $t_{m}$, and the hazard is averted if the mitigation finishes before the exposure window of duration $W$ expires.\n4. The residual time $r$ from the failure initiation to the next diagnostic check is uniformly distributed on $[0, T)$ because Poisson arrivals are independent of the deterministic sampling phase.\n5. If detection and mitigation occur within the exposure window, the hazardous event is prevented; otherwise, the event occurs.\n6. Detected-and-mitigated initiations do not contribute to hazardous occurrences, and detection outcomes across checks are independent.\n\nThe effective detection window available for checks and subsequent mitigation is the exposure window minus mitigation time:\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{eff}} = W - t_{m}.\n$$\nA check at time $r$ after failure initiation (where $r \\in [0, T)$) can still avert the hazard if it occurs before the end of the effective window. Subsequent eligible checks occur at $r + kT$ for integers $k \\geq 0$. The number of eligible checks $N(r)$ is the count of checks occurring no later than $W_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$\nN(r) = \n\\begin{cases}\n\\left\\lfloor \\dfrac{W_{\\mathrm{eff}} - r}{T} \\right\\rfloor + 1,  \\text{if } r \\leq W_{\\mathrm{eff}}, \\\\\n0,  \\text{if } r  W_{\\mathrm{eff}}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nEach eligible check detects with probability $q$, independently. The probability that at least one check detects within the eligible window, given $r$, is:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{detect}}(r) = 1 - (1 - q)^{N(r)}.\n$$\nAveraging over the residual phase $r \\sim \\mathrm{Uniform}(0, T)$ yields the effective diagnostic coverage:\n$$\nDC_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\dfrac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} \\left[ 1 - (1 - q)^{N(r)} \\right] \\, dr.\n$$\nThe adjusted occurrence rate $O'$ is obtained by thinning the Poisson process of hazardous initiations by the fraction that remain undetected (and thus unmitigated) within the window. For a homogeneous Poisson process, independent thinning by a detection probability yields another Poisson process with scaled rate. Hence,\n$$\nO' = O \\left( 1 - DC_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\right).\n$$\n\nWe now compute $DC_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ with the given parameters:\n- $T = 10$ seconds,\n- $q = 0.91$,\n- $t_{m} = 2$ seconds,\n- $W = 25$ seconds, so $W_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 25 - 2 = 23$ seconds.\n\nFor $r \\in [0, T) = [0, 10)$, we enumerate $N(r)$:\n- The eligible checks occur at $r, r + T, r + 2T, \\dots$ up to $\\leq W_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 23$.\n- If $r \\leq 3$, then $r \\leq 23$, $r + 10 \\leq 23$, and $r + 20 \\leq 23$, while $r + 30  23$. Therefore, $N(r) = 3$ for $r \\in [0, 3]$.\n- If $r \\in (3, 10)$, then $r \\leq 23$ and $r + 10 \\leq 23$, but $r + 20  23$. Therefore, $N(r) = 2$ for $r \\in (3, 10)$.\n- Since $r \\leq 10  23$, there is at least one eligible check for all $r \\in [0, 10)$.\n\nThus,\n$$\nDC_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\dfrac{1}{10} \\left( \\int_{0}^{3} \\left[ 1 - (1 - q)^{3} \\right] \\, dr + \\int_{3}^{10} \\left[ 1 - (1 - q)^{2} \\right] \\, dr \\right).\n$$\nEvaluating the integrals (which are constants over each interval) gives:\n$$\nDC_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\dfrac{1}{10} \\left( 3 \\left[ 1 - (1 - q)^{3} \\right] + 7 \\left[ 1 - (1 - q)^{2} \\right] \\right).\n$$\nSubstitute $q = 0.91$:\n$$\n1 - q = 0.09, \\quad (1 - q)^{2} = 0.0081, \\quad (1 - q)^{3} = 0.000729,\n$$\nso\n$$\n1 - (1 - q)^{2} = 0.9919, \\quad 1 - (1 - q)^{3} = 0.999271.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nDC_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\dfrac{1}{10} \\left( 3 \\times 0.999271 + 7 \\times 0.9919 \\right) = \\dfrac{1}{10} \\left( 2.997813 + 6.9433 \\right) = \\dfrac{9.941113}{10} = 0.9941113.\n$$\nThe adjusted occurrence rate is\n$$\nO' = O \\left( 1 - DC_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\right) = \\left( 2.6 \\times 10^{-5} \\right) \\times \\left( 1 - 0.9941113 \\right) = \\left( 2.6 \\times 10^{-5} \\right) \\times 0.0058887.\n$$\nCompute the product:\n$$\nO' = 1.531062 \\times 10^{-7}.\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures:\n$$\nO' \\approx 1.531 \\times 10^{-7}.\n$$\nExpress this in failures per hour as requested.\n\nAssumptions and limitations:\n- The homogeneous Poisson assumption for hazardous initiations may not hold if the hazard rate is state-dependent, time-varying, or influenced by environmental covariates; non-Poisson arrivals would require renewal or nonhomogeneous Poisson process modeling.\n- The independence of per-check detection outcomes and constancy of $q$ may be violated by correlated diagnostic errors, drifting classifier performance, or context-dependent detectability.\n- The fixed mitigation time and fixed exposure window model ignores distributions of mitigation delay and hazard progression; a more realistic treatment would integrate over their stochastic distributions.\n- Periodic sampling is idealized; asynchronous checks, variable execution time, and communication delays in cyber-physical systems can alter the residual phase distribution and the number of eligible checks.\n- Thinning the Poisson process assumes detected failures are perfectly mitigated and do not contribute to hazard; partial mitigation effectiveness or residual risk would reduce $DC_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n- Common-cause failures and dependent events captured in Fault Tree Analysis may not be fully reflected in a simple independent detection model; care is needed to align $O$ from FTA with the diagnostic mechanism's scope.\n- System-Theoretic Process Analysis emphasizes control structure and unsafe control actions; the probabilistic coverage derived here addresses detection timing but does not capture feedback control flaws, human-automation interaction, or software logic errors outside the actuator failure mode.\n- The mapping between HARA risk parameters and quantitative occurrence rates requires consistency in operational scenarios; scenario variability can change $W$, $q$, and the relationship between detection timing and hazard manifestation.\n\nUnder these assumptions, the derived $DC_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and the adjusted occurrence $O'$ provide a principled, first-principles estimate of the risk reduction attributable to DT diagnostics in this cyber-physical braking system.",
