The provided open-loop transfer function is a rational function of the complex variable $s$, which is a standard representation for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. The task of finding the frequency at which the closed-loop poles cross the imaginary axis (the point of marginal stability) is a fundamental problem in stability analysis, often solved using the Routh-Hurwitz criterion or by analyzing the root locus. The context of a \"digital twin\" and \"cyber-physical system\" serves as a modern application scenario but does not alter the underlying mathematical principles. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary information provided to derive the characteristic equation and solve for the unknown frequency. There are no scientific or logical contradictions, no ambiguities, and the premises are physically plausible for an actuator model. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\n**Step 3: Derivation and Solution**\nThe system consists of a proportional controller with gain $K$ and a plant with transfer function $G(s)$ in a unity feedback loop. The total open-loop transfer function of the system is $L(s) = K \\cdot G(s)$.\n$$\nL(s) = K \\frac{s + 8}{s(s + 1)(s + 4)}\n$$\nFor a unity feedback system, the closed-loop transfer function $T(s)$ is given by:\n$$\nT(s) = \\frac{L(s)}{1 + L(s)}\n$$\nThe closed-loop poles are the roots of the characteristic equation, which is obtained by setting the denominator of the closed-loop transfer function to zero:\n$$\n1 + L(s) = 0\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $L(s)$:\n$$\n1 + K \\frac{s + 8}{s(s + 1)(s + 4)} = 0\n$$\nTo clear the fraction, we multiply by the denominator, yielding the characteristic equation in polynomial form:\n$$\ns(s + 1)(s + 4) + K(s + 8) = 0\n$$\nExpanding the polynomial terms:\n$$\ns(s^2 + 4s + s + 4) + Ks + 8K = 0\n$$\n$$\ns(s^2 + 5s + 4) + Ks + 8K = 0\n$$\n$$\ns^3 + 5s^2 + 4s + Ks + 8K = 0\n$$\nThe final form of the characteristic equation is:\n$$\ns^3 + 5s^2 + (4 + K)s + 8K = 0\n$$\nThe problem asks for the condition under which a conjugate pair of poles lies on the imaginary axis. Such poles take the form $s = j\\omega$ and $s = -j\\omega$, where $\\omega$ is a real, positive angular frequency. This corresponds to the system being on the verge of instability, exhibiting sustained oscillations. To find this condition, we substitute $s = j\\omega$ into the characteristic equation:\n$$\n(j\\omega)^3 + 5(j\\omega)^2 + (4 + K)(j\\omega) + 8K = 0\n$$\nUsing the property $j^2 = -1$, we simplify the powers of $j$:\n$$\n-j\\omega^3 - 5\\omega^2 + j(4 + K)\\omega + 8K = 0\n$$\nFor this complex equation to be true, both its real and imaginary parts must be equal to zero. We group the terms accordingly:\n$$\n(\\text{Real Part}) + j(\\text{Imaginary Part}) = 0\n$$\n$$\n(-5\\omega^2 + 8K) + j(-\\omega^3 + (4 + K)\\omega) = 0\n$$\nThis gives us a system of two equations with two unknowns, $K$ and $\\omega$:\n1. Real part equals zero: $-5\\omega^2 + 8K = 0$\n2. Imaginary part equals zero: $-\\omega^3 + (4 + K)\\omega = 0$\n\nThe problem requires us to find $\\omega$ by eliminating $K$. From the second equation, we can factor out $\\omega$:\n$$\n\\omega(-\\omega^2 + 4 + K) = 0\n$$\nSince we are looking for the smallest *positive* angular frequency, we can assume $\\omega \\neq 0$. Thus, we can divide by $\\omega$ to get:\n$$\n-\\omega^2 + 4 + K = 0\n$$\nThis gives an expression for $K$:\n$$\nK = \\omega^2 - 4\n$$\nNow, we use the first equation from our system:\n$$\n-5\\omega^2 + 8K = 0\n$$\nSubstitute the expression for $K$ into this equation to eliminate it:\n$$\n-5\\omega^2 + 8(\\omega^2 - 4) = 0\n$$\nNow we solve this equation for $\\omega$:\n$$\n-5\\omega^2 + 8\\omega^2 - 32 = 0\n$$\n$$\n3\\omega^2 = 32\n$$\n$$\n\\omega^2 = \\frac{32}{3}\n$$\nTaking the positive square root to find the smallest positive angular frequency:\n$$\n\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{32}{3}}\n$$\nTo provide the final answer, we compute the numerical value and round it to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{32}{3}} \\approx \\sqrt{10.6666...} \\approx 3.265986...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\n\\omega \\approx 3.266 \\text{ rad/s}\n$$",

            "problem": "A cyber-physical system (CPS) axis is represented in a digital twin by the nominal single-input single-output plant $P_{n}(s) = \\dfrac{1}{(s - 0.50)(s + 2)}$, which has one unstable pole at $s = +0.50$ due to an internal positive feedback loop and one stable pole at $s = -2$. A controller engineer proposes to cancel the unstable nominal pole using a proportional-derivative structure $C(s) = K(s - 0.50)$ and to use unity feedback. The resulting nominal loop transfer function is $L_{n}(s) = C(s)P_{n}(s) = \\dfrac{K(s - 0.50)}{(s - 0.50)(s + 2)}$.

The practice of modeling an unstable system and attempting to stabilize it with feedback is a canonical problem in control engineering. The consideration of parameter uncertainty (the shift of a pole from $s=0.50$ to $s=0.55$) is a fundamental aspect of robust control design. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** All necessary mathematical models ($P_n(s)$, $P_a(s)$, $C(s)$) and the system configuration (unity feedback) are explicitly defined. The questions posed in the options are specific and can be answered through rigorous mathematical analysis of the provided functions. The problem is self-contained and not under-specified.\n3.  **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective mathematical language. While it uses contextual terms like \"digital twin\" and \"cyber-physical system,\" the core of the problem is a formal analysis of control system stability and robustness, free from subjective claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It presents a standard, albeit illustrative, scenario in control systems engineering that tests a critical concept: the non-robustness of canceling unstable poles. I will proceed with a full derivation and analysis of the options.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe core of this problem lies in the consequences of attempting to cancel a right-half-plane (RHP) pole with a RHP zero.\n\n**Analysis of the Nominal System (with exact cancellation)**\n\nThe nominal loop transfer function is $L_{n}(s) = \\dfrac{K(s - 0.50)}{(s - 0.50)(s + 2)}$. A common mistake is to algebraically cancel the $(s - 0.50)$ terms, yielding a simplified transfer function $L_{n, \\text{simplified}}(s) = \\dfrac{K}{s + 2}$. However, this cancellation is not permissible when analyzing internal stability. The state associated with the unstable pole at $s=0.50$ becomes either unobservable from the output or uncontrollable from the input, but it still exists within the system.\n\nThe stability of the closed-loop system is determined by the roots of the characteristic equation, $1 + L_{n}(s) = 0$.\n$$1 + \\frac{K(s - 0.50)}{(s - 0.50)(s + 2)} = 0$$\nTo find the roots, we find the zeros of the numerator of $1 + L_n(s)$:\n$$(s - 0.50)(s + 2) + K(s - 0.50) = 0$$\nFactoring out the $(s - 0.50)$ term:\n$$(s - 0.50)[(s + 2) + K] = 0$$\nThe roots of the characteristic equation (i.e., the closed-loop poles) are $s_1 = 0.50$ and $s_2 = -2 - K$.\nSince one of the closed-loop poles, $s_1 = 0.50$, is in the RHP, the nominal closed-loop system is **unstable** for any value of $K$. This is a fundamental result: canceling an unstable pole with a zero leads to internal instability.\n\n**Analysis of the Actual System (with imperfect cancellation)**\n\nThe actual loop transfer function is $L_{a}(s) = \\dfrac{K(s - 0.50)}{(s - 0.55)(s + 2)}$.\nThe actual closed-loop characteristic equation is $1 + L_{a}(s) = 0$.\n$$1 + \\frac{K(s - 0.50)}{(s - 0.55)(s + 2)} = 0$$\n$$(s - 0.55)(s + 2) + K(s - 0.50) = 0$$\nExpanding this polynomial:\n$$s^2 + (2 - 0.55)s - (0.55)(2) + Ks - 0.50K = 0$$\n$$s^2 + (1.45 + K)s - (1.1 + 0.50K) = 0$$\nLet the roots of this quadratic polynomial be $s_1$ and $s_2$. According to Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots is given by the constant term:\n$$s_1 s_2 = -(1.1 + 0.50K)$$\nFor any gain $K \\ge 0$, the term $(1.1 + 0.50K)$ is positive. Therefore, the product of the roots $s_1 s_2$ is always negative.\nIf the product of two numbers is negative, one must be positive and the other must be negative. Since the coefficients of the polynomial are real, the roots must be real. Thus, for any $K \\ge 0$, the actual closed-loop system has one positive real pole and one negative real pole. The presence of a positive real pole (a pole in the RHP) means the actual closed-loop system is **unstable** for all gains $K \\ge 0$.\n\nNow we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. With exact cancellation in $C(s)$, the nominal root locus reduces to a single real pole and the nominal closed-loop is stable for all $K  0$; therefore, the design is robust to small errors in the canceled pole position.**\n\nThis statement is based on the incorrect simplification of $L_n(s)$ to $\\dfrac{K}{s+2}$. Based on this simplification, the closed-loop pole would be at $s=-2-K$, which is stable for all $K0$. However, as shown in our analysis, the correct characteristic equation for the nominal system yields closed-loop poles at $s=0.50$ and $s=-2-K$. The pole at $s=0.50$ makes the system internally unstable. Therefore, the premise \"the nominal closed-loop is stable for all $K  0$\" is false. Consequently, the conclusion that the \"design is robust\" is also false. In fact, such a design is known to be exceedingly fragile.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. If the actual unstable plant pole is at $s = +0.55$ while the controller zero is at $s = +0.50$, then for unity feedback the actual closed-loop characteristic polynomial has one positive real root for all $K \\ge 0$, implying closed-loop instability regardless of gain.**\n\nOur analysis of the actual system led to the characteristic polynomial $s^2 + (1.45 + K)s - (1.1 + 0.50K) = 0$. We demonstrated that for any $K \\ge 0$, the product of the roots is $s_1 s_2 = -(1.1 + 0.50K)  0$. This forces one root to be a positive real number and the other to be a negative real number. A positive real root guarantees instability. The statement is a precise and accurate description of the actual system's behavior.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. The Nyquist plot of $L_{n}(j\\omega)$ has a large phase margin; therefore, the actual system with $P_{a}(s)$ remains stable provided $K$ is sufficiently large.**\n\nThe claim of a \"large phase margin\" comes from analyzing the simplified (and incorrect) nominal loop transfer function $L_{n, \\text{simplified}}(s) = \\dfrac{K}{s + 2}$. This is a first-order system whose phase never drops below $-90^\\circ$, resulting in a phase margin always greater than $90^\\circ$. However, the Nyquist Stability Criterion must be applied to the un-simplified open-loop system. The open-loop transfer function $P_n(s)$ has one RHP pole ($P=1$). For closed-loop stability, the Nyquist plot of $L_n(s)$ must encircle the point $-1+j0$ one time in the counter-clockwise direction ($N=-1$, assuming the standard system definition where $N=Z-P$, although many texts use $N=P-Z$, requiring a clockwise encirclement. The result is the same: $N \\neq 0$). The plot for the simplified system, $K/(s+2)$, is a semi-circle in the fourth quadrant and does not encircle $-1$ at all ($N=0$). Since $N \\neq P$, the nominal system is unstable, despite the misleading \"large phase margin\" of the simplified model. The premise is misleading, and the conclusion is false, as we proved in the analysis for option B that the actual system is unstable for all $K \\ge 0$.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The complementary sensitivity function $T(s) = \\dfrac{L(s)}{1 + L(s)}$ must be kept small near the frequency associated with the canceled dynamics to ensure robust stability under multiplicative uncertainty; exact pole-zero cancellation in $C(s)$ tends to increase fragility because it removes stabilizing roll-off around uncertain dynamics.**\n\nThis statement addresses the issue from a robust control perspective. The condition for robust stability against multiplicative uncertainty $\\Delta_m(s)$ is $|T(j\\omega)| |\\Delta_m(j\\omega)|  1$ for all $\\omega$. This implies that where uncertainty is large (i.e., $|\\Delta_m(j\\omega)|$ is large), the magnitude of the complementary sensitivity function, $|T(j\\omega)|$, must be small. Uncertainty about an unstable pole at $s=p_u$ implies large uncertainty around the corresponding frequency $\\omega \\approx |p_u|$. In our case, this is near $\\omega = 0.5$ rad/s.\n\nLet's examine $T_a(s)$ for the actual system, particularly for large $K$, near the pole we tried to cancel.\n$$T_a(s) = \\frac{L_a(s)}{1+L_a(s)} = \\frac{\\frac{K(s - 0.50)}{(s - 0.55)(s + 2)}}{1 + \\frac{K(s - 0.50)}{(s - 0.55)(s + 2)}} = \\frac{K(s - 0.50)}{(s - 0.55)(s + 2) + K(s - 0.50)}$$\nFor large $K$, the terms involving $K$ dominate the denominator. Therefore, for $s$ not equal to $0.50$:\n$$T_a(s) \\approx \\frac{K(s - 0.50)}{K(s - 0.50)} = 1$$\nThis holds true for frequencies around $\\omega=0.5$ rad/s. Having $|T(j\\omega)| \\approx 1$ is the worst-case scenario for robustness, as it allows for no multiplicative uncertainty. The pole-zero cancellation strategy actively works to make $|T(j\\omega)|$ large (close to $1$) near the critical frequency, which is the exact opposite of what is required for robustness. The statement correctly identifies that this fragility arises because the controller's zero $C(s)=K(s-0.50)$ adds gain with increasing frequency, counteracting the plant's natural roll-off and preventing the loop gain $L(s)$ from becoming small. This is a classic and correct explanation of the fragility of RHP pole cancellation.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**",
