The transmitter, Alice, sends a symbol $X$ from a ternary alphabet $\\mathcal{X} = \\{0, 1, 2\\}$ to a legitimate receiver, Bob, and an eavesdropper, Eve.\n\nThe main channel between Alice and Bob is perfect; any symbol transmitted by Alice is received by Bob without error.

If an error occurs, the two possible incorrect symbols are equally likely. The channel parameter is given as $\\alpha = 0.3$.\n\nAssuming information is measured in bits, a single use of the channel corresponds to the transmission of one symbol. Calculate the secrecy capacity of this wiretap channel configuration. Express your answer in bits per channel use, rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "The secrecy capacity $C_S$ of a wiretap channel is defined as the maximum achievable rate of secret communication. For a discrete memoryless wiretap channel, it is given by the optimization problem:\n$$C_S = \\max_{p(X)} [I(X;Y) - I(X;Z)]$$\nwhere $X$ is the random variable for the transmitted symbol, $Y$ is for Bob's received symbol, and $Z$ is for Eve's received symbol. The maximization is performed over all possible probability distributions $p(X)$ for the input symbol $X$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the mutual information $I(X;Y)$ for the main channel (Alice to Bob). The mutual information is defined as:\n$$I(X;Y) = H(Y) - H(Y|X)$$\nwhere $H(Y)$ is the entropy of the output at Bob and $H(Y|X)$ is the conditional entropy. Since the channel is perfect, $Y=X$. This means there is no uncertainty about $Y$ given $X$, so $H(Y|X) = 0$. Consequently, $Y$ has the same distribution as $X$, which means $H(Y) = H(X)$. Therefore, the mutual information for the main channel is:\n$$I(X;Y) = H(X)$$\n\nNext, let's analyze the mutual information $I(X;Z)$ for the eavesdropper's channel (Alice to Eve). This is given by:\n$$I(X;Z) = H(Z) - H(Z|X)$$\nLet's first compute the conditional entropy $H(Z|X)$.\n$$H(Z|X) = \\sum_{x \\in \\{0,1,2\\}} p(X=x) H(Z|X=x)$$\nwhere $H(Z|X=x)$ is the entropy of the eavesdropper's output given that Alice transmitted symbol $x$.\nThe problem states that the probability of correct reception by Eve is $P(Z=x|X=x) = 1-\\alpha$, and the two incorrect symbols are equally likely. This means for any $x \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$ and $z \\neq x$, the error probability is $P(Z=z|X=x) = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}$.\nLet's calculate $H(Z|X=x)$ for any specific $x$, for example $x=0$:\n$$H(Z|X=0) = -\\sum_{z \\in \\{0,1,2\\}} P(Z=z|X=0) \\log_2 P(Z=z|X=0)$$\n$$H(Z|X=0) = - \\left[ P(0|0)\\log_2 P(0|0) + P(1|0)\\log_2 P(1|0) + P(2|0)\\log_2 P(2|0) \\right]$$\n$$H(Z|X=0) = - \\left[ (1-\\alpha)\\log_2(1-\\alpha) + \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\log_2\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) + \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\log_2\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) \\right]$$\n$$H(Z|X=0) = - \\left[ (1-\\alpha)\\log_2(1-\\alpha) + \\alpha\\log_2\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) \\right]$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\log(a/b) = \\log(a) - \\log(b)$:\n$$H(Z|X=0) = - \\left[ (1-\\alpha)\\log_2(1-\\alpha) + \\alpha\\log_2(\\alpha) - \\alpha\\log_2(2) \\right]$$\n$$H(Z|X=0) = -((1-\\alpha)\\log_2(1-\\alpha) + \\alpha\\log_2(\\alpha)) + \\alpha$$\nThe term in the parentheses is the definition of the binary entropy function, $h_b(\\alpha)$. So, $H(Z|X=x) = h_b(\\alpha) + \\alpha$. Because the channel is symmetric, this value is the same for all input symbols $x$.\nTherefore, the conditional entropy $H(Z|X)$ is:\n$$H(Z|X) = \\sum_{x} p(X=x) (h_b(\\alpha) + \\alpha) = (h_b(\\alpha) + \\alpha) \\sum_{x} p(X=x) = h_b(\\alpha) + \\alpha$$\nThis quantity is independent of the input distribution $p(X)$.\n\nNow we can write the expression for the secrecy capacity as:\n$$C_S = \\max_{p(X)} [H(X) - I(X;Z)]$$\nA crucial observation is that both terms in the original expression, $I(X;Y) = H(X)$ and $I(X;Z)$, are maximized by the same input distribution. $H(X)$ is maximized when the input distribution is uniform, i.e., $p(X=x) = 1/3$ for $x \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$. The eavesdropper's channel is a symmetric channel, and the capacity of a symmetric channel is achieved when the input distribution is uniform.\nTherefore, the maximization of the difference is the difference of the maxima:\n$$C_S = \\left(\\max_{p(X)} I(X;Y)\\right) - \\left(\\max_{p(X)} I(X;Z)\\right) = C_B - C_E$$\nwhere $C_B$ and $C_E$ are the capacities of the main and eavesdropper channels, respectively.\n\nThe capacity of the main channel is $C_B = \\max_{p(X)} H(X) = \\log_2(3)$, achieved with a uniform input.\n\nThe capacity of the symmetric eavesdropper channel is $C_E = \\log_2(|\\mathcal{Z}|) - H(\\text{row of transition matrix})$, where $|\\mathcal{Z}|=3$ is the size of the output alphabet and $H(\\text{row})$ is the entropy of any row of the transition matrix, which we found to be $h_b(\\alpha) + \\alpha$.\n$$C_E = \\log_2(3) - (h_b(\\alpha) + \\alpha)$$\n\nSubstituting these capacities back into the expression for $C_S$:\n$$C_S = C_B - C_E = \\log_2(3) - [\\log_2(3) - (h_b(\\alpha) + \\alpha)]$$\n$$C_S = h_b(\\alpha) + \\alpha$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given value $\\alpha=0.3$:\n$$C_S = h_b(0.3) + 0.3 = -[0.3\\log_2(0.3) + (1-0.3)\\log_2(1-0.3)] + 0.3$$\n$$C_S = -[0.3\\log_2(0.3) + 0.7\\log_2(0.7)] + 0.3$$\nWe use the base change formula $\\log_2(x) = \\frac{\\ln(x)}{\\ln(2)}$.\n$\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147$\n$\\ln(0.3) \\approx -1.20397$\n$\\ln(0.7) \\approx -0.356675$\n\n$\\log_2(0.3) = \\frac{-1.20397}{0.693147} \\approx -1.73697$\n$\\log_2(0.7) = \\frac{-0.356675}{0.693147} \\approx -0.514573$\n\nNow, we calculate $h_b(0.3)$:\n$$h_b(0.3) \\approx -[0.3 \\times (-1.73697) + 0.7 \\times (-0.514573)]$$\n$$h_b(0.3) \\approx -[-0.521091 - 0.360201] = -[-0.881292] = 0.881292$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the secrecy capacity:\n$$C_S = h_b(0.3) + 0.3 \\approx 0.881292 + 0.3 = 1.181292$$\nThe problem asks to round the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$C_S \\approx 1.181$$\nThe secrecy capacity is 1.181 bits per channel use.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.181}$$", "id": "1656645"}, {"introduction": "Secrecy is not always a matter of signal strength; it can also be achieved by cleverly encoding information to create ambiguity for the eavesdropper.
