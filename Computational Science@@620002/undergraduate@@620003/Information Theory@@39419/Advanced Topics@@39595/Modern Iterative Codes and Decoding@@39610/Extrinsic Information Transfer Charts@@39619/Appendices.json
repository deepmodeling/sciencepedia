The system employs an iterative decoding process where two constituent soft-in/soft-out decoders exchange information. To analyze the convergence behavior of this decoder, the engineer uses an Extrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) chart.\n\nAn EXIT chart plots the transfer characteristics of the decoders. For a given component decoder, it shows the mutual information between a coded bit and the decoder's extrinsic output, denoted $I_E$, as a function of the mutual information between that bit and the a priori input, denoted $I_A$. The chart contains two curves: one for the first component decoder, $T_1$, and one for the second, $T_2$. The decoding process is visualized as a trajectory between these two curves, which are plotted on the same axes (with the axes for $T_2$ appropriately inverted).\n\nFor the iterative process to decode successfully and achieve a vanishingly small error rate, the decoding trajectory must be able to reach the point $(I_A, I_E) = (1, 1)$, which represents perfect knowledge. This requires an open \"tunnel\" between the two curves leading to this point.\n\nThe engineer simulates the system and plots the EXIT chart for her chosen component codes. She observes that even at a very high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), the two EXIT curves intersect at a point $(I_A^*, I_E^*)$ where both $I_A^*$ and $I_E^*$ are noticeably less than 1.

Successful decoding with vanishing error probability requires an open tunnel from the starting point near $(I_{A},I_{E}) \\approx (0, T_{1}(0;\\gamma))$ to the point $(1,1)$. This ensures that the sequence $\\{I_{A,1}^{(l)}\\}$ (and equivalently $\\{I_{E,i}^{(l)}\\}$) can monotonically increase to $1$.\n\nIf, even at very high $\\gamma$, the two EXIT curves intersect at $(I_{A}^{*}, I_{E}^{*})$ with $I_{A}^{*} < 1$ and $I_{E}^{*} < 1$, the tunnel to $(1,1)$ is closed.

For a binary, equiprobable coded bit $X \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and any decoder output statistic $L$ (e.g., a posteriori LLR derived from the exchanged extrinsic information), the mutual information satisfies\n$$\nI(X;L) = 1 - H(X \\mid L),\n$$\nso $I(X;L) < 1$ implies $H(X \\mid L) > 0$.
