Consider a receiver equipped with two separate antennas. The signal received at each antenna travels through an independent path. This configuration is known as a two-branch diversity system.\n\nThe channels associated with the two antennas are modeled as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh fading channels. Due to this fading, the instantaneous Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) at each branch, denoted by $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$, is a random variable.
