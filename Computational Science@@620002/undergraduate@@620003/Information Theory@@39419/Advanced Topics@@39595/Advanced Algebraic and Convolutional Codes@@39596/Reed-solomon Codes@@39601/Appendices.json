To combat this, the probe's communication system employs a Reed-Solomon (RS) error-correcting code.\n\nThe system processes data in blocks. Each original data message, consisting of $k$ symbols, is passed through an RS encoder. The encoder appends a set of parity symbols, resulting in a longer transmitted codeword of length $n$ symbols. For the Stellartrek-1 mission, the code is configured with a codeword length of $n = 31$ symbols and an original message length of $k = 21$ symbols.

Not all errors can be corrected, and a decoder must be able to recognize when a received word is hopelessly corrupted.

A decoder then uses the Berlekamp-Massey (BM) algorithm to find the error-locator polynomial, $\\Lambda(z)$, from this syndrome sequence. The decoder is designed to declare a \"decoding failure\" if the degree of the polynomial $\\Lambda(z)$ found by the algorithm is strictly greater than the code's error-correcting capability $t$. This situation implies that the received word is considered uncorrectable.\n\nThe condition that the degree of $\\Lambda(z)$ is greater than $t$ is equivalent to the condition that the syndrome sequence $(S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_{2t})$ cannot be generated by any Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) of length $t$ or less.
