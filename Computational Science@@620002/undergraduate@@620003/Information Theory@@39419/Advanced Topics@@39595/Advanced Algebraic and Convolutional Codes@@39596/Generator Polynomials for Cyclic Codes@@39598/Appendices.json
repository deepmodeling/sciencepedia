A polynomial $g(x)$ with coefficients in the binary field $F_2$ is said to generate a binary cyclic code of length $n$ if the set of all codewords consists of polynomials of degree less than $n$ which are multiples of $g(x)$, and this set of codewords is closed under cyclic shifts. A fundamental requirement for such a code to exist is that the generator polynomial $g(x)$ must divide the polynomial $x^n+1$ in the polynomial ring $F_2[x]$, where all coefficient arithmetic is performed modulo 2.\n\nConsider a system designed to use a binary cyclic code of length $n=7$.

We must determine, for $n=7$, which proposed $g(x)$ does not divide $x^{7}+1$.\n\nFirst, use the Remainder Theorem in $F_{2}$ to test $g_{A}(x)=x+1$. The remainder of dividing any polynomial $f(x)$ by $x+1$ is $f(1)$. Compute $f(1)$ for $f(x)=x^{7}+1$:\n$$\n1^{7}+1=1+1=0 \\quad \\text{in } F_{2}.\n$$\nThus $x+1$ divides $x^{7}+1$, so $A$ is valid.\n\nNext, consider $g_{B}(x)=x^{3}+x+1$. Let $\\alpha$ be a root of $x^{3}+x+1$ in an extension field. Since $x^{3}+x+1$ is irreducible over $F_{2}$, the field $F_{2}(\\alpha)$ has $2^{3}=8$ elements, and its multiplicative group has order $7$. The only possible orders of a nonzero element are the divisors of $7$, namely $1$ and $7$. Evaluate $x^{3}+x+1$ at $x=1$:\n$$\n1^{3}+1+1=1 \\neq 0 \\quad \\text{in } F_{2},\n$$\nso $\\alpha \\neq 1$.

Therefore the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$, namely $x^{3}+x+1$, divides $x^{7}+1$, and $B$ is valid.\n\nFor $g_{D}(x)=(x+1)(x^{3}+x+1)$, since each factor divides $x^{7}+1$ and\n$$\n\\gcd(x+1,\\,x^{3}+x+1)=1 \\quad \\text{(because } (x^{3}+x+1)(1)=1 \\neq 0 \\text{ in } F_{2}),\n$$\nit follows from the property that if $g_{1} \\mid P$ and $g_{2} \\mid P$ with $\\gcd(g_{1},g_{2})=1$, then $g_{1}g_{2} \\mid P$, that $(x+1)(x^{3}+x+1)$ divides $x^{7}+1$. Thus $D$ is valid.\n\nFinally, examine $g_{C}(x)=x^{2}+1$. Over $F_{2}$,\n$$\nx^{2}+1=(x+1)^{2},\n$$\nsince $(x+1)^{2}=x^{2}+2x+1=x^{2}+1$ in $F_{2}$. If $(x+1)^{2}$ were to divide $x^{7}+1$, then $x=1$ would be a double root of $x^{7}+1$. The multiplicity of a root can be checked via the formal derivative.
