The strategy consists of a sequence of independent trades. For each trade, there are two possible outcomes: a \"win\" or a \"loss\". A winning trade results in a net profit equal to a fixed multiple of the amount invested, while a losing trade results in the complete loss of the invested amount.\n\nThe firm's model for capital management aims to maximize the long-term expected logarithmic growth of the portfolio. This model prescribes investing a specific, constant fraction, $f^*$, of the total available capital in each trade.\n\nBased on historical data and market analysis, the following parameters have been established:\n- The payout ratio for a winning trade, denoted by $b$, is $2$. This means an investment of $X$ that wins will yield a net profit of $2X$.\n- The optimal fraction of capital to invest per trade, calculated to maximize the logarithmic growth, is $f^* = 0.1$.\n\nAssuming the probability of a win, $p$, is constant for each trade, determine the value of $p$.

The net profit is $bfW$.\n2.  **Loss**: This occurs with probability $q = 1-p$. The invested amount $fW$ is lost. The capital changes from $W$ to $W' = W - fW = W(1-f)$.\n\nThe goal of the strategy is to maximize the expected logarithmic growth of the capital. The growth factor in a single trade is $W'/W$. We want to maximize the expected value of the natural logarithm of this growth factor, which is called the growth rate, $g(f)$.\n\nThe expected growth rate is given by:\n$$g(f) = E[\\ln(W'/W)] = p \\ln(1+bf) + (1-p) \\ln(1-f)$$\n\nTo find the optimal fraction $f^*$ that maximizes this function, we take the derivative of $g(f)$ with respect to $f$ and set it to zero.\n$$\\frac{dg}{df} = \\frac{d}{df} [p \\ln(1+bf) + (1-p) \\ln(1-f)]$$\nUsing the chain rule for differentiation, we get:\n$$\\frac{dg}{df} = p \\cdot \\frac{1}{1+bf} \\cdot b + (1-p) \\cdot \\frac{1}{1-f} \\cdot (-1)$$\n$$\\frac{dg}{df} = \\frac{pb}{1+bf} - \\frac{1-p}{1-f}$$\n\nSetting the derivative to zero for the optimal fraction $f = f^*$:\n$$\\frac{pb}{1+bf^*} - \\frac{1-p}{1-f^*} = 0$$\n$$\\frac{pb}{1+bf^*} = \\frac{1-p}{1-f^*}$$\n\nThis equation defines the optimal fraction $f^*$, often known as the Kelly criterion.
