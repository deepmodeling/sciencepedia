The program is assumed to run on a fixed, universal Turing machine.\n\nImagine a simple data storage protocol where, for redundancy, a data string $x$ is sometimes stored back-to-back with an identical copy of itself, forming the concatenated string $xx$.

Since Kolmogorov complexity is formally uncomputable, we often use real-world compression algorithms as a powerful proxy to measure the \"randomness\" of data. This exercise guides you through a computational experiment to analyze the output of the famous logistic map, a simple equation that can generate behavior ranging from perfect order to chaos, giving you a tangible sense of how algorithmic complexity manifests in dynamical systems [@problem_id:2409515].", "problem": "You are asked to study the compressibility of symbolic sequences generated by the logistic map in the context of computational physics. The logistic map is defined on the unit interval by the deterministic recurrence relation $$x_{n+1} = r\\,x_n\\,(1 - x_n),$$ where $x_n \\in (0,1)$ and $r \\in (0,4]$ is a control parameter. The goal is to quantify how the compressibility of a thresholded symbolic sequence derived from this map varies with $r$, using a standard Lempel–Ziv family compressor.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definition of the logistic map and the deterministic iteration process, perform the following steps for each specified value of $r$:\n\n1. Generate a real-valued trajectory by iterating the logistic map. Use a fixed initial condition $x_0 = 0.123456789$. Apply a transient removal of $B$ iterations to reduce dependence on the initial condition. After discarding the transient, continue iterating to produce $L$ additional values. The total number of map evaluations is therefore $B + L$. Use $B = 1000$ and $L = 32768$.\n\n2. Produce a binary symbolic sequence by thresholding the post-transient iterates at $1/2$: for each post-transient iterate $x_n$, define a bit $s_n$ by\n$$\ns_n = \\begin{cases}\n1, & \\text{if } x_n > \\tfrac{1}{2},\\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise.}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis yields a sequence of $L$ bits.\n\n3. Pack the $L$ bits into bytes in big-endian bit order within each byte, grouping bits from left to right in the temporal order of $s_n$. If $L$ is not a multiple of $8$, pad the last byte on the right (least significant bits) with zeros so that the total number of bits is a multiple of $8$. This yields an array of original data with length $L_{\\mathrm{bytes}}$ bytes, where $L_{\\mathrm{bytes}} = \\lceil L/8 \\rceil$.\n\n4. Compress the resulting byte sequence using a standard Lempel–Ziv compressor from the Deflate family with a fixed compression level.

The compressor must be Deflate (zlib) with compression level $9$ applied to the packed bytes as described.", "solution": "The posed problem is a valid exercise in computational physics, specifically in the study of nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all parameters and procedures are specified with sufficient clarity and precision to permit a unique, reproducible computational solution. I will therefore proceed with a detailed solution.\n\nThe problem asks for an analysis of the complexity of symbolic sequences generated by the logistic map, $x_{n+1} = r\\,x_n(1-x_n)$, as a function of the control parameter $r$. The complexity is quantified by the compressibility of the sequence, measured using a standard Lempel-Ziv compression algorithm. A low compression ratio, $\\mathcal{R}$, signifies a highly ordered, predictable sequence (e.g., periodic), whereas a high compression ratio approaching $1$ indicates a complex, random-like sequence characteristic of chaos. The analysis will be performed for several values of $r$ that represent distinct dynamical regimes of the logistic map.\n\nThe solution is implemented by following the five steps prescribed in the problem statement for each given value of $r$.\n\n**Step 1: Trajectory Generation**\n\nThe core of the system is the logistic map, a recurrence relation given by\n$$x_{n+1} = r \\cdot x_n \\cdot (1 - x_n)$$\nwhere $x_n \\in [0, 1]$ represents the state of the system at iteration $n$, and $r \\in [0, 4]$ is the bifurcation parameter that controls the qualitative behavior of the dynamics.\n\nWe begin by iterating the map starting from a specified initial condition $x_0 = 0.123456789$. The first $B=1000$ iterations constitute a transient phase. We discard these values to ensure that the subsequent trajectory accurately represents the system's attractor, thereby minimizing dependence on the arbitrary choice of $x_0$. After this transient removal, we continue to iterate the map for an additional $L=32768$ steps, recording each value of $x_n$ for $n$ from $1001$ to $11000+32768$. This generates a time series of $L$ real numbers that represents the settled dynamics on the attractor. All calculations are performed using double-precision floating-point arithmetic.\n\n**Step 2: Symbolic Sequence Generation**\n\nTo analyze the structure of the trajectory, we convert the continuous-valued time series $\\{x_n\\}$ into a discrete, binary symbolic sequence $\\{s_n\\}$. This process, a form of coarse-graining, is achieved by partitioning the phase space (the interval $[0, 1]$) at the midpoint $x=1/2$. This specific threshold is dynamically significant as it corresponds to the critical point of the map, where the function $f(x) = r x(1-x)$ attains its maximum. The symbolic dynamics are defined by the rule:\n$$\ns_n = \\begin{cases}\n1, & \\text{if } x_n > \\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\\n0, & \\text{if } x_n \\le \\tfrac{1}{2}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis generates a binary sequence of length $L=32768$, where each bit indicates whether the trajectory was in the right half ($x_n > 1/2$) or the left half ($x_n \\le 1/2$) of the interval at that time step.\n\n**Step 3: Bit Packing**\n\nStandard compression algorithms, such as those in the `zlib` library, operate on sequences of bytes, not individual bits. Therefore, the generated binary sequence $\\{s_n\\}$ of length $L = 32768$ must be packed into a byte array. Since $L=32768$ is an integer multiple of $8$ ($32768 = 8 \\times 4096$), the sequence consists of exactly $L_{\\mathrm{bytes}} = 4096$ groups of $8$ bits.\n\nThe packing follows a big-endian convention. The first eight bits of the sequence, $s_0, s_1, \\ldots, s_7$, form the first byte. The bit $s_0$ becomes the most significant bit (MSB), and $s_7$ becomes the least significant bit (LSB). The integer value of the first byte is thus $\\sum_{i=0}^{7} s_i 2^{7-i}$. This process is repeated for all subsequent groups of $8$ bits, resulting in a byte array of length $L_{\\mathrm{bytes}}=4096$. The problem statement includes a rule for padding if $L$ is not a multiple of $8$, but this is not invoked for the specified $L$.\n\n**Step 4: Compression**\n\nThe resulting byte array is compressed using the DEFLATE algorithm, as implemented in the `zlib` library, which is a standard in data compression. DEFLATE combines the LZ77 algorithm with Huffman coding. LZ77 achieves compression by finding and replacing repeated sequences of bytes with back-references. This method is exceptionally effective at detecting regular patterns. A highly periodic symbolic sequence (e.g., `010101...` from a period-$2$ orbit) will contain extensive repetition and thus be highly compressible. Conversely, a chaotic sequence, which is aperiodic and random-like, will exhibit few repeating patterns and be largely incompressible.\nWe use the highest compression level, level $9$, to ensure the algorithm invests maximal computational effort in finding redundancies. The output of the compression is another byte array, whose length we denote by $C_{\\mathrm{bytes}}$.\n\n**Step 5: Compression Ratio Calculation**\n\nFinally, we compute the compression ratio $\\mathcal{R}$ as the ratio of the compressed data size to the original data size:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{bytes}}}{L_{\\mathrm{bytes}}}\n$$\nThis dimensionless quantity provides a normalized measure of the symbolic sequence's complexity. A value of $\\mathcal{R}$ close to $0$ implies high regularity and low complexity, while a value of $\\mathcal{R}$ close to $1$ implies high complexity, approaching algorithmic randomness. This procedure is repeated for each specified value of the parameter $r$, allowing a quantitative comparison of the complexity across different dynamical regimes.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nimport zlib\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the compression ratio of symbolic sequences from the logistic map\n    for a given set of control parameters `r`.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the problem parameters directly as specified.\n    x0 = 0.123456789\n    B = 1000  # Transient iterations\n    L = 32768  # Post-transient sequence length\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases_r = [\n        2.9,        # Fixed-point regime\n        3.2,        # Period-2 regime\n        3.5,        # Periodic regime beyond period-doubling\n        3.56995,    # Onset of chaos (Feigenbaum point, approximate)\n        3.8,        # Chaotic regime\n        4.0         # Fully developed chaos\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for r in test_cases_r:\n        # Step 1: Generate a real-valued trajectory\n        x = x0\n        \n        # Discard B transient iterations\n        for _ in range(B):\n            x = r * x * (1.0 - x)\n            \n        # Generate L post-transient values\n        trajectory = np.zeros(L, dtype=np.float64)\n        for i in range(L):\n            x = r * x * (1.0 - x)\n            trajectory[i] = x\n\n        # Step 2: Produce a binary symbolic sequence\n        # s_n = 1 if x_n > 0.5, else 0\n        symbolic_sequence = (trajectory > 0.5).astype(np.uint8)\n\n        # Step 3: Pack the L bits into bytes\n        # L = 32768 is a multiple of 8, so no padding is necessary.\n        # np.packbits packs an array of booleans or integers (0 or 1) into bytes.\n        # 'big' bitorder means the first element in each 8-bit chunk is the MSB.\n        original_bytes = np.packbits(symbolic_sequence, bitorder='big').tobytes()\n        L_bytes = len(original_bytes)\n\n        # Step 4: Compress the byte sequence\n        # Use zlib (DEFLATE) with the highest compression level.\n        compressed_bytes = zlib.compress(original_bytes, level=9)\n        C_bytes = len(compressed_bytes)\n\n        # Step 5: Compute the compression ratio\n        compression_ratio = C_bytes / L_bytes\n        results.append(compression_ratio)\n\n    # Format the results as specified: rounded to 6 decimal places.\n    formatted_results = [f\"{res:.6f}\" for res in results]\n    \n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(formatted_results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2409515"}]}
