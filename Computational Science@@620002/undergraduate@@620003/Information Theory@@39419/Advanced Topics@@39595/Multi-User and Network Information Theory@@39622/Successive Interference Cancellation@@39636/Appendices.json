The communication occurs over a shared wireless channel which can be modeled as a Gaussian Multiple Access Channel (MAC). The signal received at the hub, $Y$, is a linear superposition of the transmitted signals and background noise, an effect known as Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). The model is given by:\n$$Y = h_1 X_1 + h_2 X_2 + Z$$\nHere, $X_1$ and $X_2$ are the signals transmitted by Sensor 1 and Sensor 2, respectively. They are modeled as independent random variables with zero mean and average transmit powers $E[X_1^2] = P_1$ and $E[X_2^2] = P_2$. The parameters $h_1$ and $h_2$ are real-valued, constant channel gains that represent the signal attenuation for each sensor. The noise $Z$ is a Gaussian random variable, independent of $X_1$ and $X_2$, with zero mean and power $N$.\n\nTo decode the two signals, the hub employs a technique called Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC). The receiver first decodes the signal from the user with the higher received power, treating the other user's signal as additional noise. Assuming this first decoding is perfect, the receiver then reconstructs this user's signal, subtracts it from the total received signal $Y$, and proceeds to decode the second, weaker user's signal from the residual signal.\n\nGiven the following parameters:\n- Transmit power of Sensor 1, $P_1 = 12.0 \\text{ mW}$\n- Transmit power of Sensor 2, $P_2 = 20.0 \\text{ mW}$\n- Channel power gain for Sensor 1, $h_1^2 = 0.60$\n- Channel power gain for Sensor 2, $h_2^2 = 0.40$\n- Noise power, $N = 2.0 \\text{ mW}$\n\nCalculate the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) for the first user to be decoded (let's call this User A) and the SINR for the second user to be decoded (User B).
