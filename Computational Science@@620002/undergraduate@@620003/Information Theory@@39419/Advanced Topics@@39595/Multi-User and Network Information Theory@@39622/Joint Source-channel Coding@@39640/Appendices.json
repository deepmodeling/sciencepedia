However, this principle relies on idealized assumptions, such as infinitely long codes. This first practice problem demonstrates what happens in a more practical scenario when a highly efficient but variable-length source code, like a Huffman code, is directly transmitted over a noisy channel. By tracing the effect of a single bit error, you will witness the phenomenon of catastrophic error propagation, a critical concept that motivates the need for joint source-channel coding strategies.
