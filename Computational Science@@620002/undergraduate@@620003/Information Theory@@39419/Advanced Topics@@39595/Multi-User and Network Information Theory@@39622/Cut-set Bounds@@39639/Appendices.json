The network consists of three intermediate repeater nodes, $R_1$, $R_2$, and $R_3$. The communication topology is established by the following six directed, noiseless digital links, each with a specified capacity measured in bits per symbol time:\n- A link from $S$ to $R_1$ with capacity $C_1$.\n- A link from $S$ to $R_2$ with capacity $C_2$.\n- A link from $S$ to $R_3$ with capacity $C_3$.\n- A link from $R_1$ to $D$ with capacity $C_4$.\n- A link from $R_2$ to $D$ with capacity $C_5$.\n- A link from $R_3$ to $D$ with capacity $C_6$.\n\nA key characteristic of this network is that each repeater node ($R_1$, $R_2$, and $R_3$) has a processing delay. Specifically, when a symbol arrives at a repeater node, there is a mandatory waiting period of one full symbol time before it can be processed and forwarded on its outgoing link. The source node $S$ and the destination node $D$ have zero processing delay.\n\nConsider a partition of the network nodes into two sets: one set containing only the source node $S$, and the other set containing all remaining nodes ($R_1, R_2, R_3, D$).
