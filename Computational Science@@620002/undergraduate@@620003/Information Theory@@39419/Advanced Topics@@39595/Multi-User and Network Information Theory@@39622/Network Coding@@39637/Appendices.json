Consider a simplified communication network consisting of four nodes: a source node S, two intermediate relay nodes R1 and R2, and a single sink node T.\n\nThe source node S generates two distinct data packets, $X_1$ and $X_2$. These packets are elements of a vector space, and all operations are linear. The data flows through the network according to the following protocol:\n\n1.  The source S transmits packet $X_1$ to the relay node R1.\n2.  The source S transmits packet $X_2$ to the relay node R2.\n3.  The relay node R1, upon receiving its packet, forwards it unaltered to the relay node R2.\n4.  The relay node R2 creates an output packet for the sink node T by performing a linear combination of the two packets it has received. The packet originating from the source S (which is $X_2$) is scaled by a factor $\\alpha$, and the packet originating from the relay R1 (which is $X_1$) is scaled by a factor $\\beta$. The resulting two scaled packets are then summed together to form the single packet that is transmitted from R2 to T.\n5.  The sink node T receives only this single packet from R2.\n\nThe final packet received at the sink T, denoted $Y_T$, can be written as a unique linear combination of the original source packets, in the form $Y_T = g_1 X_1 + g_2 X_2$.
