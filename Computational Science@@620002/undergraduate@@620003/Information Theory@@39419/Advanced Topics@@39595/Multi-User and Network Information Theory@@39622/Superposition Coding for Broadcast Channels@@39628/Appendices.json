Due to their different geographical locations, the signal quality received by each station differs. This communication scenario can be modeled as a Gaussian Broadcast Channel (BC). The signal transmitted by the satellite is denoted by $X$. The signals received by the stations are given by:\n$Y_1 = X + Z_1$\n$Y_2 = X + Z_2$\nwhere $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ are independent, zero-mean Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) processes with variances $\\sigma_1^2$ and $\\sigma_2^2$, respectively.

The satellite has a total average transmission power constraint of $P$.\n\nTo serve both users simultaneously, the satellite employs a layered coding strategy. The transmitted signal $X$ is a superposition of two independent signals, $X_1$ and $X_2$, such that $X = X_1 + X_2$. The signal $X_1$ carries a private message intended only for Station 1, while $X_2$ carries a common message intended for both stations (but primarily for Station 2).

The solution involves analyzing the decoding process at Station 1 step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's establish the power allocation for the two superimposed signals, $X_1$ and $X_2$. The total power is $P$. The problem states that a fraction $\\alpha$ of the total power is allocated to the common signal $X_2$. Therefore, the power of $X_2$ is:\n$$P_2 = E[X_2^2] = \\alpha P$$\nThe remaining power is allocated to the private signal $X_1$. So, the power of $X_1$ is:\n$$P_1 = E[X_1^2] = (1-\\alpha)P$$\nSince $X_1$ and $X_2$ are independent, the total power is $E[X^2] = E[(X_1+X_2)^2] = E[X_1^2] + E[X_2^2] = (1-\\alpha)P + \\alpha P = P$, which is consistent with the total power constraint.\n\nThe signal received by Station 1 is $Y_1 = X + Z_1 = X_1 + X_2 + Z_1$. The noise $Z_1$ has a power (variance) of $\\sigma_1^2$.\n\nThe decoding process at Station 1 happens in two stages, a technique known as Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC).\n\nStage 1: Decoding the common message signal $X_2$.\nStation 1 first decodes the common message $X_2$. For this to be possible, the rate of the common message must be chosen such that it is decodable even by the weaker user (Station 2). Since Station 1 has a better channel ($\\sigma_1^2  \\sigma_2^2$), it can decode this message successfully.\n\nStage 2: Decoding the private message signal $X_1$.\nAfter successfully decoding $X_2$, Station 1 perfectly subtracts it from the received signal $Y_1$. Let the new, modified signal be $Y_1'$.\n$$Y_1' = Y_1 - X_2 = (X_1 + X_2 + Z_1) - X_2 = X_1 + Z_1$$\nNow, Station 1 decodes its private message from $Y_1'$. In this effective channel, the signal of interest is $X_1$ and the noise is just the original channel noise $Z_1$.\n\nTo find the achievable rate $R_1$ for this private message, we apply the given AWGN channel capacity formula, $C = \\log_2(1 + S/N)$.\nFor this decoding step:\n- The signal is $X_1$, so the signal power is $S = P_1 = (1-\\alpha) P$.\n- The noise is $Z_1$, so the noise power is $N = \\sigma_1^2$.\n\nSubstituting these into the capacity formula gives the achievable rate $R_1$ for the private message:\n$$R_1 = \\log_2\\left(1 + \\frac{S}{N}\\right) = \\log_2\\left(1 + \\frac{(1-\\alpha) P}{\\sigma_1^2}\\right)$$\n\nThis expression is in terms of the specified parameters $P$, $\\alpha$, and $\\sigma_1^2$.
