This code uses a block of 7 physical qubits. The logical information is encoded in a special subspace, called the codespace, which is defined by a set of measurement operators. The system is designed such that the codespace consists of all quantum states that are simultaneously eigenvectors with eigenvalue +1 for a set of 4 independent and mutually commuting stabilizer generators.

This is achieved through syndrome measurement, a process that extracts information about the error without disturbing the encoded logical state. In this practice [@problem_id:1651121], you will act as a quantum detective, using the commutation properties of Pauli operators to interpret a measured syndrome and pinpoint the exact location of a phase-flip error within a 3-qubit code, illustrating the central mechanism of active error correction.", "problem": "In a prototype quantum computer, a logical qubit is encoded using the 3-qubit phase-flip code to protect it from environmental noise. A phase-flip error on a specific qubit $i$ is described by the application of the Pauli-Z operator, denoted as $Z_i$. The Pauli operators for a single qubit are fundamental, and their anti-commutation relation is key to error detection. Specifically, for any given qubit $i$, the Pauli-X and Pauli-Z operators for that qubit anti-commute: $X_i Z_i = -Z_i X_i$. In contrast, Pauli operators acting on different qubits commute. For example, $X_i Z_j = Z_j X_i$ for $i \\neq j$, and $X_i X_j = X_j X_i$ for $i \\neq j$.\n\nThe 3-qubit phase-flip code is defined by two stabilizer operators: $S_1 = X_1 \\otimes X_2 \\otimes I_3$ and $S_2 = I_1 \\otimes X_2 \\otimes X_3$. Here, $X_k$ is the Pauli-X operator acting on qubit $k$, and $I_k$ is the identity operator on qubit $k$. Any valid encoded state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is a simultaneous eigenvector of both stabilizers with an eigenvalue of $+1$, i.e., $S_j |\\psi\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle$ for $j=1,2$.\n\nIf an error, represented by an operator $E$, occurs, the state becomes $|\\psi_{err}\\rangle = E|\\psi\\rangle$. To detect the error, the eigenvalues of the stabilizers are measured. The result of this measurement is a syndrome, which is an ordered pair of classical bits $(m_1, m_2)$. The outcome $m_j$ is 0 if the measured eigenvalue of $S_j$ is $+1$, and $m_j$ is 1 if the eigenvalue is $-1$.\n\nSuppose an encoded state is subjected to noise, and it is determined that exactly one qubit has undergone a phase-flip error. A subsequent syndrome measurement yields the result $(m_1, m_2) = (1, 0)$.\n\nDetermine the index $k$ (where $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$) of the qubit on which the phase-flip error occurred.", "solution": "We use the stabilizer formalism.

The measured eigenvalue of $S_{j}$ on $|\\psi_{\\text{err}}\\rangle$ is determined by whether $S_{j}$ commutes or anticommutes with $Z_{k}$.
