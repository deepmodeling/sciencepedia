In this protocol, Alice sends quantum bits (qubits) to Bob, encoding classical bits of information.\n\nThe encoding scheme is as follows:\n- To send a classical bit '0', Alice can prepare a qubit in the state $|0\\rangle$ (from the rectilinear basis) or in the state $|+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle)$ (from the diagonal basis).\n- To send a classical bit '1', Alice can prepare a qubit in the state $|1\\rangle$ (from the rectilinear basis) or in the state $|-\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle - |1\\rangle)$ (from the diagonal basis).\n\nFor each qubit she sends, Alice makes two independent random choices: she chooses the classical bit to send (0 or 1, each with 50% probability) and she chooses the basis to use (rectilinear or diagonal, each with 50% probability).\n\nAn eavesdropper, Eve, implements an intercept-resend attack on every single qubit transmitted from Alice to Bob.
