This problem asks you to derive the rate-distortion function for a Bernoulli($p$) source under Hamming distortion, a scenario that models countless real-world communication channels. Solving this will reveal the classic and elegant relationship between rate, distortion, and entropy, $R(D) = H(p) - H(D)$, which forms the bedrock of lossy compression theory. [@problem_id:1652137]", "problem": "Consider a discrete memoryless source that generates binary symbols, $X$, from the alphabet $\\mathcal{X} = \\{0, 1\\}$. The probability of generating a '1' is $P(X=1) = p$, and the probability of generating a '0' is $P(X=0) = 1-p$. For simplicity, assume $0 < p \\le 1/2$. We wish to compress the output of this source and represent it with symbols, $\\hat{X}$, from the same alphabet $\\hat{\\mathcal{X}} = \\{0, 1\\}$.\n\nThe quality of the compression is measured by the single-letter Hamming distortion, defined as $d(x, \\hat{x}) = 0$ if $x = \\hat{x}$ and $d(x, \\hat{x}) = 1$ if $x \\neq \\hat{x}$. The average distortion is denoted by $D = E[d(X, \\hat{X})]$.\n\nThe rate-distortion function, $R(D)$, gives the minimum achievable rate (in bits per symbol) for a given maximum average distortion $D$. Find the expression for the rate-distortion function $R(D)$ for this source in the region where the rate is non-zero. Your final answer should be expressed in terms of the binary entropy function, $H(y) = -y \\log_2(y) - (1-y)\\log_2(1-y)$, and may involve the parameters $p$ and $D$.", "solution": "The rate-distortion function $R(D)$ is defined as the minimum possible mutual information $I(X; \\hat{X})$ between the source $X$ and the reconstruction $\\hat{X}$ over all joint distributions $p(x, \\hat{x})$ such that the average distortion $E[d(X, \\hat{X})]$ does not exceed $D$.\n$$R(D) = \\min_{p(\\hat{x}|x) : E[d(X,\\hat{X})] \\le D} I(X; \\hat{X})$$\nThe mutual information can be expressed in terms of entropy as $I(X; \\hat{X}) = H(X) - H(X|\\hat{X})$. For the given Bernoulli source, the entropy $H(X)$ is constant and equal to $H(p)$. Therefore, minimizing $I(X; \\hat{X})$ is equivalent to maximizing the conditional entropy $H(X|\\hat{X})$.\n\n$$R(D) = H(p) - \\max_{p(\\hat{x}|x) : E[d(X,\\hat{X})] \\le D} H(X|\\hat{X})$$\n\nWe can find an upper bound for $H(X|\\hat{X})$ using Fano's inequality. The Hamming distortion $d(x, \\hat{x})$ is 1 if $x \\neq \\hat{x}$ and 0 otherwise. Thus, the average distortion is the probability of error: $D = E[d(X, \\hat{X})] = P(X \\neq \\hat{X})$.\n\nFano's inequality states that for any two random variables $X$ and $\\hat{X}$ with the same alphabet $\\mathcal{X}$,\n$$H(X|\\hat{X}) \\le H(P(X \\neq \\hat{X})) + P(X \\neq \\hat{X}) \\log_2(|\\mathcal{X}|-1)$$\nFor our binary source, $|\\mathcal{X}|=2$, so $\\log_2(|\\mathcal{X}|-1) = \\log_2(1) = 0$. Using $P(X \\neq \\hat{X}) \\le D$, we get:\n$$H(X|\\hat{X}) \\le H(D)$$\nThis provides a lower bound on the rate-distortion function:\n$$R(D) \\ge H(p) - H(D)$$\nThis bound is achievable if we can find a test channel (i.e., a conditional distribution $p(\\hat{x}|x)$) that simultaneously satisfies the distortion constraint $E[d(X, \\hat{X})] = D$ and achieves the entropy bound $H(X|\\hat{X}) = H(D)$.\n\nLet's construct such a channel. The condition $H(X|\\hat{X}) = H(D)$ is met if the conditional distribution of $X$ given $\\hat{X}$ is a simple binary distribution with probability $D$. Let's define a *reverse* test channel where the crossover probability is $D$:\n$$p(X=1|\\hat{X}=0) = D \\quad \\text{and} \\quad p(X=0|\\hat{X}=1) = D$$\nThis implies $p(X=0|\\hat{X}=0) = 1-D$ and $p(X=1|\\hat{X}=1) = 1-D$.\nThe conditional entropy $H(X|\\hat{X}=\\hat{x})$ is thus $H(D)$ for both $\\hat{x}=0$ and $\\hat{x}=1$. Consequently, the total conditional entropy is $H(X|\\hat{X}) = \\sum_{\\hat{x}} p(\\hat{x}) H(X|\\hat{X}=\\hat{x}) = H(D)$.\n\nNow, we need to define the output distribution $p(\\hat{x})$ such that the source distribution $p(x)$ is recovered and the distortion constraint is met. Let $p(\\hat{X}=1) = q$. Then $p(\\hat{X}=0) = 1-q$. The marginal probability $P(X=1)$ can be calculated as:\n$$P(X=1) = \\sum_{\\hat{x}} P(\\hat{X}=\\hat{x}) P(X=1|\\hat{X}=\\hat{x})$$\n$$p = (1-q) P(X=1|\\hat{X}=0) + q P(X=1|\\hat{X}=1)$$\n$$p = (1-q)D + q(1-D) = D - qD + q - qD = q(1-2D) + D$$\nSolving for $q$:\n$$q = \\frac{p-D}{1-2D}$$\nFor $q$ to be a valid probability, we need $0 \\le q \\le 1$.\nGiven $p \\le 1/2$, the condition $D \\le p < 1/2$ ensures that $1-2D > 0$.\nThe requirement $q \\ge 0$ implies $p-D \\ge 0$, so $D \\le p$.\nThe requirement $q \\le 1$ implies $p-D \\le 1-2D$, so $D \\le 1-p$.\nSince we are given $p \\le 1/2$, we have $p \\le 1-p$. Therefore, the stricter condition is $D \\le p$. So, this construction is valid for $0 \\le D \\le p$.\n\nFinally, let's verify the average distortion for this channel:\n$$E[d(X, \\hat{X})] = P(X \\neq \\hat{X}) = \\sum_{\\hat{x}} P(\\hat{X}=\\hat{x}) P(X \\neq \\hat{x} | \\hat{X}=\\hat{x})$$\n$$E[d(X, \\hat{X})] = P(\\hat{X}=0) P(X=1|\\hat{X}=0) + P(\\hat{X}=1) P(X=0|\\hat{X}=1)$$\n$$E[d(X, \\hat{X})] = (1-q)D + qD = D$$\nThe distortion constraint is satisfied with equality.\n\nSince we have constructed a channel that produces distortion $D$ and has a rate $I(X;\\hat{X}) = H(p) - H(D)$ for any $D$ in the range $0 \\le D \\le p$, the lower bound is achievable. For $D > p$, we can achieve zero rate. For example, by always setting $\\hat{X}=0$ (since 0 is the more probable symbol), the distortion is $D = P(X=1) = p$ and the rate is $I(X; \\text{const}) = 0$. Since $R(D)$ is a non-increasing function, $R(D)=0$ for all $D \\ge p$.\n\nThe expression for the rate-distortion function in the non-trivial region ($0 \\le D \\le p$) is therefore:\n$$R(D) = H(p) - H(D)$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{H(p) - H(D)}$$", "id": "1652137"}, {"introduction": "Building on the binary case, we now explore a source with multiple output levels, a situation common in digital signal processing.
