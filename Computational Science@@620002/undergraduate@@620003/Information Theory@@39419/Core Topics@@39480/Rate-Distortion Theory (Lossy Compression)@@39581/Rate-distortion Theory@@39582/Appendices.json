The performance of this system is evaluated using the squared-error distortion measure, where the average distortion $D$ is given by the expected value of the squared difference between the original signal and its reconstruction: $D = E[(X - \\hat{X})^2]$.\n\nDue to extreme bandwidth constraints, the system is designed to operate at a rate of zero bits per source symbol. This \"zero-rate\" encoding means that no information about the specific value of any given a sample $x$ can be transmitted. Consequently, the decoder must produce the same constant estimate, let's call it $\\hat{x}_c$, for every source symbol it is asked to reconstruct.\n\nTo achieve the best possible performance under this severe constraint, the constant estimate $\\hat{x}_c$ must be chosen to minimize the average distortion $D$.\n\nCalculate this minimum achievable average distortion for the zero-rate system.

The distortion measure is the mean squared error, $D = E[(X - \\hat{x}_c)^2]$. Our goal is to find the optimal constant $\\hat{x}_c$ that minimizes this distortion, and then calculate the value of this minimum distortion.\n\nFirst, let's express the average distortion $D$ as a function of the constant estimate $\\hat{x}_c$.\n$$D(\\hat{x}_c) = E[(X - \\hat{x}_c)^2]$$\nWe can expand the squared term inside the expectation:\n$$D(\\hat{x}_c) = E[X^2 - 2X\\hat{x}_c + \\hat{x}_c^2]$$\nUsing the linearity of the expectation operator, we can write:\n$$D(\\hat{x}_c) = E[X^2] - E[2X\\hat{x}_c] + E[\\hat{x}_c^2]$$\nSince $\\hat{x}_c$ is a constant, we can pull it out of the expectations:\n$$D(\\hat{x}_c) = E[X^2] - 2\\hat{x}_c E[X] + \\hat{x}_c^2$$\nTo find the value of $\\hat{x}_c$ that minimizes $D$, we can treat $D$ as a function of $\\hat{x}_c$ and find its minimum by taking the derivative with respect to $\\hat{x}_c$ and setting it to zero.\n$$\\frac{dD(\\hat{x}_c)}{d\\hat{x}_c} = \\frac{d}{d\\hat{x}_c} (E[X^2] - 2\\hat{x}_c E[X] + \\hat{x}_c^2)$$\nThe term $E[X^2]$ is a constant with respect to $\\hat{x}_c$, so its derivative is zero.\n$$\\frac{dD(\\hat{x}_c)}{d\\hat{x}_c} = 0 - 2E[X] + 2\\hat{x}_c$$\nSetting the derivative to zero to find the minimum:\n$$-2E[X] + 2\\hat{x}_c = 0$$\n$$\\hat{x}_c = E[X]$$\nThis shows that the optimal constant estimate that minimizes the mean squared error is the mean (expected value) of the source random variable.\n\nFor the given source, $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$, the mean is $E[X] = 0$. Therefore, the optimal constant reconstruction is $\\hat{x}_c = 0$.\n\nNow we substitute this optimal value back into the distortion formula to find the minimum achievable distortion:\n$$D_{min} = E[(X - 0)^2] = E[X^2]$$\nWe need to find the value of $E[X^2]$. We can use the definition of variance:\n$$\\text{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2$$\nRearranging this to solve for $E[X^2]$:\n$$E[X^2] = \\text{Var}(X) + (E[X])^2$$\nFor our source, we are given that the variance is $\\text{Var}(X) = \\sigma^2$ and the mean is $E[X] = 0$.\nSubstituting these values:\n$$E[X^2] = \\sigma^2 + 0^2 = \\sigma^2$$\nThus, the minimum achievable average distortion for the zero-rate system is $\\sigma^2$.
