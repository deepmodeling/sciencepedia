This first exercise provides a concrete foundation for quantifying this error by examining the common task of a digital thermometer rounding a temperature to the nearest integer.

The true temperature, denoted by the continuous random variable $X$, is accurately modeled by a uniform distribution over the range $[-5.5, 5.5]$ degrees Celsius. The thermometer's internal analog-to-digital converter processes the true temperature $X$ and outputs a quantized value $\\hat{X}$, which is the integer closest to $X$.\n\nThe performance of this quantization process can be evaluated using different distortion measures. We consider two common ones:\n1.  The squared-error distortion, defined for a true value $x$ and its quantized version $\\hat{x}$ as $d_2(x, \\hat{x}) = (x - \\hat{x})^2$.\n2.  The absolute-error distortion, defined as $d_1(x, \\hat{x}) = |x - \\hat{x}|$.\n\nThe average distortion is the expected value of the distortion measure over the distribution of the true temperature $X$.

The probability distribution of this source is uniform over a large area of the plane. To digitize this source, we use a quantizer that maps the source vector $\\mathbf{X}$ to the nearest point in a predefined set of representative points, called a codebook. These codebook points form a regular lattice structure that tessellates the plane.\n\nWe will compare two different lattice quantization schemes: one based on a square grid and another on a regular hexagonal grid. In the first scheme, the representative points are the centers of a square tiling of the plane. In the second, they are the centers of a regular hexagonal tiling.\n\nTo ensure a fair comparison, both schemes must use the same density of representative points. This is equivalent to requiring that the area of a single quantization cell (the Voronoi region around a representative point) is the same for both lattices. Let this common cell area be denoted by $A$.\n\nThe quality of the quantization is measured by the average distortion.
