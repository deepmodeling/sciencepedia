The sensor readings are modeled as samples drawn from a continuous-valued, memoryless Gaussian source with a variance of $\\sigma^2$. To manage the limited communication bandwidth, the data is compressed before transmission. The quality of the compressed signal is measured by the Mean Squared Error (MSE), denoted by $D$, between the original and the reconstructed signal upon reception at the ground station. The mission specification requires that the signal-to-distortion ratio, which is defined as the ratio of the source variance to the MSE ($\\sigma^2/D$), must be exactly 64.

While we often use it to find the required rate, the equation can be rearranged to solve for any of its variables.

The sensor output can be modeled as a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables, where each variable follows a Gaussian probability distribution with a mean of zero and an unknown variance $\\sigma^2$. An advanced compression algorithm is employed that operates at the theoretical limit defined by rate-distortion theory for a Gaussian source under a Mean Squared Error (MSE) distortion measure.
