We will calculate each one separately.\n\nFirst, we determine the minimum distance $d(C)$ of the original code $C$. For a linear code, the minimum distance is equal to the minimum Hamming weight of its non-zero codewords. The codewords of $C$ are all possible linear combinations (over $\\mathbb{F}_2$) of the rows of its generator matrix $G_C$. The rows of $G_C$ are $r_1 = (1, 1, 0, 1, 0)$ and $r_2 = (0, 1, 1, 0, 1)$.\n\nThe code $C$ is a $[5, 2]$ code, so it has dimension $k=2$. This means there are $2^k = 2^2 = 4$ codewords in total. We list them and find their Hamming weights (the number of non-zero elements).\nThe zero codeword is $0 \\cdot r_1 + 0 \\cdot r_2 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0)$, which has a weight of 0.\nThe non-zero codewords are:\n1. $c_1 = 1 \\cdot r_1 + 0 \\cdot r_2 = r_1 = (1, 1, 0, 1, 0)$.

We apply this theorem to the code $C^{\\perp}$ using its parity-check matrix $H_{\\perp}$.\n\nLet the columns of $H_{\\perp}$ be $h_1, h_2, h_3, h_4, h_5$:\n$$\nh_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad h_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad h_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad h_4 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad h_5 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe need to find the smallest number of these column vectors that sum to the zero vector $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n- **Size 1:** Is any single column the zero vector? No. So, $d(C^{\\perp}) > 1$.\n- **Size 2:** Does there exist a pair of columns $\\{h_i, h_j\\}$ with $i \\neq j$ such that $h_i + h_j = 0$? This is equivalent to $h_i = h_j$ since we are in $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\nBy inspection, we can see that $h_1 = h_4 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. Thus, $h_1 + h_4 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This is a linear dependency of size 2.\nWe also see that $h_3 = h_5 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, so $h_3 + h_5 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, which is another linear dependency of size 2.\n\nSince we have found a set of 2 linearly dependent columns, and we have already established that the minimum size of such a set must be greater than 1, the smallest number of linearly dependent columns is 2.\nTherefore, the minimum distance of the dual code $C^{\\perp}$ is $d(C^{\\perp}) = 2$.\n\nCombining our results, the ordered pair is $(d(C), d(C^{\\perp})) = (3, 2)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{(3, 2)}$$", "id": "1641639"}]}
