The system can process a set of 75 distinct operational commands. To send a command, it is first converted into a binary message block, using the minimum number of bits required to uniquely identify each command. This message block is then processed by a Forward Error Correction (FEC) encoder. The encoder takes the message block and appends a fixed number of 10 parity-check bits to form a single, longer codeword that is transmitted through the communication channel.
