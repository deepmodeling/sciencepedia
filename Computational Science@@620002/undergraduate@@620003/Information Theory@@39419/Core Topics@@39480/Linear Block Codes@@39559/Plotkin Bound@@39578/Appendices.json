One form of this bound states that for any binary code with parameters $(n, M, d)$ that satisfies the condition $2d > n$, the number of codewords $M$ must be less than or equal to a specific maximum value.

Consider the complete graph on $10$ vertices, $K_{10}$. It has a $1$-factorization, that is, its $45$ edges can be partitioned into $9$ disjoint perfect matchings. Label the vertices $v_{1},\\dots,v_{10}$ and the $9$ perfect matchings as $P_{1},\\dots,P_{9}$. For each matching $P_{j}$, assign a bijection from its $5$ edges to the $5$ alphabet symbols $\\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$. Define the codeword $c^{(i)} \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4\\}^{9}$ for vertex $v_{i}$ by letting its $j$-th coordinate $c^{(i)}_{j}$ be the symbol assigned to the unique edge of $P_{j}$ that contains $v_{i}$. For any distinct $i,k$, the pair $\\{v_{i},v_{k}\\}$ forms exactly one edge of $K_{10}$ and hence lies together in exactly one matching $P_{j^{*}}$. Therefore $c^{(i)}_{j} = c^{(k)}_{j}$ if and only if $j=j^{*}$, so the two codewords agree in exactly one coordinate and their Hamming distance is $9-1=8$. This constructs a $5$-ary code of length $9$ with $M=10$ and minimum distance $8$.\n\nThe Plotkin bound shows $M \\le 10$ and the construction attains $M=10$, hence the maximum possible number of codewords is $M=10$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10}$$", "id": "1646709"}]}
