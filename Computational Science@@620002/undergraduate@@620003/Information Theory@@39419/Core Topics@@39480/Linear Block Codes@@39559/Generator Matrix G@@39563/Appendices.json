Let's analyze the structure of a codeword and the properties of Hamming weight.\n\nLet the generator matrix be a $k \\times n$ matrix $G$. We can represent its rows as $g_1, g_2, \\ldots, g_k$. Each $g_i$ is a vector of length $n$.\n$$\nG = \\begin{pmatrix}\ng_1 \\\\\ng_2 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\ng_k\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe problem states that the Hamming weight of each row is even.

In other words, for any two binary vectors $a$ and $b$, the following congruence holds:\n$w(a+b) \\equiv w(a) + w(b) \\pmod{2}$.\nThis property extends to a sum of multiple vectors. Thus, we can analyze the weight of the codeword $c$ modulo 2:\n$$\nw(c) = w\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{k} u_i g_i\\right) \\equiv \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w(u_i g_i) \\pmod{2}\n$$\nNow, let's examine the term $w(u_i g_i)$. Since $u_i$ is either 0 or 1:\n- If $u_i = 0$, then $u_i g_i$ is the zero vector, and its weight is $w(0 \\cdot g_i) = w(\\mathbf{0}) = 0$.\n- If $u_i = 1$, then $u_i g_i$ is the vector $g_i$ itself, and its weight is $w(1 \\cdot g_i) = w(g_i)$.\nIn both cases, we can write $w(u_i g_i) = u_i \\cdot w(g_i)$.\n\nSubstituting this back into our congruence for the weight of $c$:\n$$\nw(c) \\equiv \\sum_{i=1}^{k} u_i \\cdot w(g_i) \\pmod{2}\n$$\nWe are given that the weight of every row $g_i$ is even, which means $w(g_i) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$ for all $i$. Let's substitute this crucial piece of information:\n$$\nw(c) \\equiv \\sum_{i=1}^{k} u_i \\cdot (0) \\pmod{2}\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\nw(c) \\equiv \\sum_{i=1}^{k} 0 \\pmod{2}\n$$\n$$\nw(c) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}\n$$\nThis result shows that the Hamming weight of any codeword $c$ generated by this matrix $G$ must be an even number. This is true for any choice of the message vector $u$. This includes the zero codeword, which is generated by the zero message vector $u=\\mathbf{0}$, resulting in $c=\\mathbf{0}$ with $w(c)=0$, which is even.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"All codewords generated by $G$ have an even Hamming weight\" is correct. This corresponds to option A.\n\nLet's briefly analyze the other options:\n- B. \"All non-zero codewords generated by $G$ have an odd Hamming weight.\" This is directly contradicted by our derivation.\n- C. \"The number of even-weight codewords is equal to the number of odd-weight codewords.\" This is a property of linear codes that do not have the special property given. In our case, all $2^k$ codewords have even weight, and there are 0 odd-weight codewords.\n- D. \"The minimum distance of the code must be exactly 2.\" The minimum distance $d_{min}$ of a linear code is the minimum Hamming weight of any non-zero codeword. Our derivation shows all non-zero codewords have even weight, so $d_{min}$ must be an even integer greater than 0. However, it does not have to be *exactly* 2. It could be 4, 6, or any other even integer. For example, the code generated by the single row $g_1 = (1,1,1,1)$ has $w(g_1)=4$. The non-zero codeword is just $(1,1,1,1)$, and the minimum distance is 4. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n- E. \"The property of the row weights does not provide any information about the weights of the other codewords.\" This is false, as we were able to draw a very specific conclusion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1626317"}]}
