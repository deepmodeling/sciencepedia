If the transmitted codeword was $c$ and the error pattern is $e$, then the received vector is $r = c + e$. The syndrome is then:\n$$\ns = (c+e)H^T = cH^T + eH^T\n$$\nFor any valid codeword $c$, by definition, $cH^T = 0$. Therefore, the syndrome only depends on the error pattern:\n$$\ns = eH^T\n$$\nThe problem states that the all-zero codeword was transmitted, so $c = (0,0,0,0,0,0,0)$. This means the received vector $r$ is identical to the error pattern $e$, i.e., $r=e$.\n\nFirst, let's determine the target syndrome. This is the syndrome corresponding to a single-bit error in the first position. Let this error pattern be $e_1 = (1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)$. The syndrome $s_1$ is:\n$$\ns_1 = e_1 H^T\n$$\nThis operation effectively selects the first row of $H^T$.

Thus, the target syndrome is $s_1 = (1, 1, 0)$.\n\nNext, we need to find a received vector $r$ with a Hamming weight of two, $w(r)=2$, that produces this same syndrome. Since we've established $r=e$, we are looking for an error pattern $e$ with $w(e)=2$. An error pattern of weight two means that exactly two bits were flipped. Let the errors be in positions $i$ and $j$, where $i \\neq j$. The error pattern can be written as $e = e_i + e_j$, where $e_k$ is a vector with a 1 in the $k$-th position and 0s elsewhere.\n\nThe syndrome of this error pattern $e$ is:\n$$\ns_e = eH^T = (e_i + e_j)H^T = e_iH^T + e_jH^T\n$$\nThe term $e_k H^T$ corresponds to the $k$-th row of $H^T$, which is also the $k$-th column of $H$. Let's denote the $k$-th column of $H$ as $h_k$. Then, $s_e = h_i + h_j$.\n\nWe are looking for indices $i$ and $j$ such that $s_e = s_1$, which means:\n$$\nh_i + h_j = h_1\n$$\nLet's list the columns of $H$:\n$h_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $h_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, $h_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, $h_4 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, $h_5 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $h_6 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $h_7 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nWe need to find a pair of distinct columns $(h_i, h_j)$ that sum up to $h_1 = (1, 1, 0)^T$. Let's systematically test pairs of columns.\nLet's try summing $h_2$ with other columns:\n$h_2 + h_3 = (0,1,1)^T + (1,1,1)^T = (1,0,0)^T = h_5$. This is not $h_1$.\n$h_2 + h_4 = (0,1,1)^T + (1,0,1)^T = (1,1,0)^T$. This is equal to $h_1$.\n\nSo, we have found a valid pair of indices: $i=2$ and $j=4$. The corresponding error pattern $e$ has errors in the 2nd and 4th positions.\n$$\ne = e_2 + e_4 = (0,1,0,0,0,0,0) + (0,0,0,1,0,0,0) = (0,1,0,1,0,0,0)\n$$\nThe Hamming weight of this vector is $w(e)=2$, which satisfies the condition. Since the all-zero codeword was sent, this error pattern is the received vector, $r=e$.\n\nTherefore, a possible received vector is $r = (0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0)$.\n\nFor completeness, we can check for other solutions. For example:\n$h_3 + h_7 = (1,1,1)^T + (0,0,1)^T = (1,1,0)^T = h_1$.\nThis gives another valid error pattern $e' = e_3 + e_7 = (0,0,1,0,0,0,1)$.
