During its journey to Earth, a single cosmic ray strike corrupts the transmission, flipping exactly one bit.

All arithmetic should be performed modulo 2. Express your answer as a 3-element row vector.", "solution": "The problem asks for the syndrome vector $s$ of a received vector $y$. The syndrome is defined by the equation $s = H y^T$, where $H$ is the parity-check matrix and all calculations are performed modulo 2 (i.e., in the binary field $\\mathbb{F}_2$).\n\nFirst, we must determine the received vector $y$. The transmitted codeword was the all-zero vector, $c = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$. A single-bit error occurred at the 3rd position. This can be represented by an error vector $e$ which has a '1' at the position of the error and '0's elsewhere. For an error in the 3rd position, the error vector is $e = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]$.\n\nThe received vector $y$ is the sum (modulo 2) of the transmitted codeword $c$ and the error vector $e$:\n$$ y = c + e = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] + [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0] = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0] $$\nTo calculate the syndrome, we first need the transpose of $y$, which is a column vector:\n$$ y^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow, we compute the product $s = H y^T$:\n$$ s = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe perform the matrix-vector multiplication, remembering that all additions and multiplications are modulo 2.\nThe first component of the syndrome, $s_1$, is the dot product of the first row of $H$ with $y^T$:\n$$ s_1 = (1 \\cdot 0) + (1 \\cdot 0) + (1 \\cdot 1) + (0 \\cdot 0) + (1 \\cdot 0) + (0 \\cdot 0) + (0 \\cdot 0) = 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1 $$\nThe second component, $s_2$, is the dot product of the second row of $H$ with $y^T$:\n$$ s_2 = (1 \\cdot 0) + (1 \\cdot 0) + (0 \\cdot 1) + (1 \\cdot 0) + (0 \\cdot 0) + (1 \\cdot 0) + (0 \\cdot 0) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 $$\nThe third component, $s_3$, is the dot product of the third row of $H$ with $y^T$:\n$$ s_3 = (1 \\cdot 0) + (0 \\cdot 0) + (1 \\cdot 1) + (1 \\cdot 0) + (0 \\cdot 0) + (0 \\cdot 0) + (1 \\cdot 0) = 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1 $$\nSo, the syndrome column vector is $s = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The problem asks for the answer as a row vector, which is $[1, 0, 1]$.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a fundamental property of linear codes. The syndrome is $s = H y^T = H(c+e)^T$. By linearity, this is $s = Hc^T + He^T$. For any valid codeword $c$, by definition, $Hc^T = 0$. Therefore, the syndrome depends only on the error vector: $s = He^T$. When the error vector $e$ has a single '1' in the $i$-th position, the product $He^T$ is simply the $i$-th column of the matrix $H$. In this problem, the error is in the 3rd position, so the syndrome is the 3rd column of $H$.\nLooking at the given matrix $H$:\n$$ H = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & \\mathbf{1} & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 & \\mathbf{0} & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & \\mathbf{1} & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe 3rd column is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.
