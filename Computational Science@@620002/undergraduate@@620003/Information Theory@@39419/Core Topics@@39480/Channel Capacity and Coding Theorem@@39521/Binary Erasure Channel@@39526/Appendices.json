The communication channel can be modeled as a Binary Erasure Channel (BEC). In a BEC, a transmitted bit $X$, which can be either 0 or 1, is received as an output $Y$. With a certain probability $p$, called the erasure probability, the transmitted bit is lost and the receiver gets an erasure symbol, denoted by '?'. With probability $1-p$, the bit is transmitted correctly. Thus, the output alphabet is $Y \\in \\{0, 1, ?\\}$.\n\nFollowing a severe solar flare, the probe's transmitter is catastrophically damaged. Ground control observes that every single bit transmitted from the probe is now received on Earth as an erasure symbol '?'.
