{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To truly understand Move-to-Front (MTF) coding, we must first trace its operations step-by-step. This exercise walks you through the core mechanics of the algorithm, where you will process an input string and generate the corresponding sequence of costs. By tracking the dynamic changes to the symbol list and observing the output, you will build a foundational understanding of how MTF encodes information based on symbol recency [@problem_id:1641837].", "id": "1641837", "problem": "The Move-to-Front (MTF) algorithm is a dynamic list-based encoding scheme used in data compression. It maintains an ordered list of symbols in the alphabet. To encode a symbol from an input sequence, the algorithm performs the following steps:\n1.  Locate the symbol in the current list and record its 1-indexed position (the \"cost\" of encoding).\n2.  Transmit this position as the encoded output.\n3.  Move the just-encoded symbol to the very front of the list, shifting other symbols back as necessary to fill the gap.\n\nConsider an alphabet consisting of the unique characters from the word `STATISTICS`. An MTF encoder is initialized with a list of these characters sorted alphabetically: `(A, C, I, S, T)`.\n\nYour task is to determine the sequence of integer costs that the MTF encoder generates when processing the input sequence `STATISTICS`. Present your answer as a sequence of numbers in a row matrix.\n\n", "solution": "We apply the Move-to-Front (MTF) algorithm using a 1-indexed position cost and moving the encoded symbol to the front after each step. The alphabet is the set of unique characters from STATISTICS, sorted alphabetically as $(A,C,I,S,T)$. Initialize\n$$L_{0}=(A,C,I,S,T).$$\nProcess the input sequence STATISTICS symbol by symbol:\n\n1. Symbol $S$: in $L_{0}$ its position is $4$, so $c_{1}=4$. Update $L_{1}=(S,A,C,I,T)$.\n2. Symbol $T$: in $L_{1}$ its position is $5$, so $c_{2}=5$. Update $L_{2}=(T,S,A,C,I)$.\n3. Symbol $A$: in $L_{2}$ its position is $3$, so $c_{3}=3$. Update $L_{3}=(A,T,S,C,I)$.\n4. Symbol $T$: in $L_{3}$ its position is $2$, so $c_{4}=2$. Update $L_{4}=(T,A,S,C,I)$.\n5. Symbol $I$: in $L_{4}$ its position is $5$, so $c_{5}=5$. Update $L_{5}=(I,T,A,S,C)$.\n6. Symbol $S$: in $L_{5}$ its position is $4$, so $c_{6}=4$. Update $L_{6}=(S,I,T,A,C)$.\n7. Symbol $T$: in $L_{6}$ its position is $3$, so $c_{7}=3$. Update $L_{7}=(T,S,I,A,C)$.\n8. Symbol $I$: in $L_{7}$ its position is $3$, so $c_{8}=3$. Update $L_{8}=(I,T,S,A,C)$.\n9. Symbol $C$: in $L_{8}$ its position is $5$, so $c_{9}=5$. Update $L_{9}=(C,I,T,S,A)$.\n10. Symbol $S$: in $L_{9}$ its position is $4$, so $c_{10}=4$. Update $L_{10}=(S,C,I,T,A)$.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of costs is\n$$(c_{1},c_{2},c_{3},c_{4},c_{5},c_{6},c_{7},c_{8},c_{9},c_{10})=(4,5,3,2,5,4,3,3,5,4).$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 5 & 3 & 2 & 5 & 4 & 3 & 3 & 5 & 4 \\end{pmatrix}}$$"}]}
