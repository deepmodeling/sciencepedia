This means $Y=X$. We assume $H(X) = H_0 > 0$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the direct consequences of the condition $Y=X$.\nSince $Y$ is an identical copy of $X$, they must have the same probability distribution. The entropy of a random variable is determined solely by its probability distribution. Therefore, the entropy of $Y$ must be equal to the entropy of $X$.\n$$H(Y) = H(X) = H_0$$\n\nNext, we evaluate the conditional entropies. The conditional entropy $H(Y|X)$ quantifies the average uncertainty remaining about $Y$ when the value of $X$ is known.\nGiven the condition $Y=X$, if we know the value of $X$, we know the value of $Y$ with perfect certainty. There is no remaining uncertainty. Thus, the conditional entropy $H(Y|X)$ must be zero.\n$$H(Y|X) = 0$$\nBy a symmetrical argument, if we know the value of $Y$, we also know the value of $X$ with perfect certainty. Therefore, the conditional entropy $H(X|Y)$ is also zero.\n$$H(X|Y) = 0$$\n\nNow, we can use the fundamental identities of information theory to find the joint entropy $H(X,Y)$ and the mutual information $I(X;Y)$.\n\nThe chain rule for entropy relates joint and conditional entropies:\n$$H(X,Y) = H(X) + H(Y|X)$$\nSubstituting the values we have found:\n$$H(X,Y) = H_0 + 0 = H_0$$\nSo, the joint entropy of the pair $(X,Y)$ is equal to the entropy of $X$ alone. This makes intuitive sense: since $Y$ is just a copy of $X$, the pair $(X,Y)$ contains no more information or uncertainty than $X$ by itself. In terms of the Venn diagram, this means the total area of the union of the two circles is equal to the area of the circle for $X$.\n\nNext, let's find the mutual information $I(X;Y)$. Mutual information can be defined as:\n$$I(X;Y) = H(X) - H(X|Y)$$\nSubstituting the values we have found:\n$$I(X;Y) = H_0 - 0 = H_0$$\nThe mutual information is also equal to the entropy of $X$. This also makes sense: since $X$ and $Y$ are identical, all the information in $X$ is shared with $Y$. In the Venn diagram, this means the intersection area is equal to the area of the circle for $X$.\n\nLet's summarize our findings:\n1. $H(X) = H_0$\n2. $H(Y) = H_0$\n3. $H(X|Y) = 0$\n4. $H(Y|X) = 0$\n5. $H(X,Y) = H_0$\n6. $I(X;Y) = H_0$\n\nThis set of relations corresponds to a Venn diagram where the two circles, representing $X$ and $Y$, are of equal size and perfectly overlap.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\nA. $I(X;Y) = 0$ and $H(X,Y) = 2H_0$. This describes two independent random variables. Our variables are perfectly dependent, so this is incorrect.\nB. $H(X,Y) = H_0$ and $I(X;Y) = H_0$. This perfectly matches our derived results for joint entropy and mutual information. This is the correct option.\nC. $H(X,Y) > H_0$ and $I(X;Y) < H_0$. This describes the general case of two variables that are correlated but not perfectly determined by each other (i.e., their circles partially overlap). This is incorrect.\nD. $H(X,Y) = H_0$ and $I(X;Y) < H_0$. This would imply $H(X,Y) = H(X)$ but $I(X;Y) < H(X)$. From $I(X;Y) = H(X) - H(X|Y)$, this would mean $H(X|Y) > 0$, contradicting our finding that $H(X|Y)=0$. This case corresponds to one circle being a proper subset of another, which would mean $H(Y) < H(X)$, but we know $H(X)=H(Y)$. This option is incorrect.\nE. $H(X,Y) = 0$. This would only be true if $H(X)=0$, which means $X$ is a deterministic constant. The problem statement specifies that $H(X)>0$.
