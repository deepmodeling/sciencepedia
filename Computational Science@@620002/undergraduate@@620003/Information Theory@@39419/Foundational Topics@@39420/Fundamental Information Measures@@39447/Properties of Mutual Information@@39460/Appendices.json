We will calculate each term separately. All logarithms are base 2, as required for an answer in bits.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the entropy of the source signal $X$, denoted by $H(X)$. The random variable $X$ is uniformly distributed over the set $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. Therefore, the probabilities of its outcomes are:\n$P(X=-1) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n$P(X=0) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n$P(X=1) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nThe entropy $H(X)$ is given by the formula $H(X) = -\\sum_{x} P(x) \\log_{2}(P(x))$.\n$$H(X) = - \\left( P(X=-1)\\log_{2}(P(X=-1)) + P(X=0)\\log_{2}(P(X=0)) + P(X=1)\\log_{2}(P(X=1)) \\right)$$\n$$H(X) = - \\left( \\frac{1}{3}\\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) + \\frac{1}{3}\\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) + \\frac{1}{3}\\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\right)$$\n$$H(X) = -3 \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = -\\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\log_{2}(3)$$\n\nNext, we calculate the conditional entropy $H(X|Y)$. This is defined as $H(X|Y) = \\sum_{y} P(y)H(X|Y=y)$. To do this, we first need to find the probability distribution of $Y$. The possible values for $Y=X^2$ are:\nIf $X=-1$, then $Y = (-1)^2 = 1$.\nIf $X=0$, then $Y = (0)^2 = 0$.\nIf $X=1$, then $Y = (1)^2 = 1$.\n\nSo, the set of possible values for $Y$ is $\\{0, 1\\}$. Now we find their probabilities:\nThe event $Y=0$ occurs only if $X=0$. So, $P(Y=0) = P(X=0) = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nThe event $Y=1$ occurs if $X=-1$ or $X=1$. So, $P(Y=1) = P(X=-1) + P(X=1) = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nNow we can calculate the conditional entropies for each value of $y$:\nCase 1: $Y=0$.\nGiven $Y=0$, we know for certain that $X$ must be 0. There is no uncertainty left. The conditional probability distribution $P(X|Y=0)$ is $P(X=0|Y=0)=1$ and $P(X=x|Y=0)=0$ for $x \\neq 0$.\nThe conditional entropy is $H(X|Y=0) = - \\sum_x P(x|Y=0) \\log_{2}(P(x|Y=0)) = - (1 \\cdot \\log_{2}(1)) = 0$.\n\nCase 2: $Y=1$.\nGiven $Y=1$, we know that $X$ could be either $-1$ or $1$.
