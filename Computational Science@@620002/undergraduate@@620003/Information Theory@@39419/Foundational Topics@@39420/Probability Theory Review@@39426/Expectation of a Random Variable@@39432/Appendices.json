This practice sharpens our skills in working with probability mass functions and demonstrates a common technique for analyzing the combined output of multiple independent sources.", "problem": "In a simplified model of a fault detection system, two independent sensors, Sensor 1 and Sensor 2, monitor a machine. Each sensor can report an integer \"severity level\" from the set $\\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$, where $N$ is a positive integer representing the maximum possible severity level. For each sensor, any given severity level is equally likely to be reported. The system's \"overall severity level\" is defined as the maximum of the two levels reported by the sensors. Let $X_1$ be the severity level reported by Sensor 1 and $X_2$ be the severity level reported by Sensor 2. The overall severity level is thus $Y = \\max(X_1, X_2)$.\n\nDetermine the expected value of the overall severity level, $E[Y]$, as a function of $N$.", "solution": "Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be the random variables representing the severity levels reported by Sensor 1 and Sensor 2, respectively. The problem states that $X_1$ and $X_2$ are independent and uniformly distributed on the set of integers $\\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$. The probability mass function (PMF) for each sensor is therefore:\n$$P(X_i = k) = \\frac{1}{N} \\quad \\text{for } k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\} \\text{ and } i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$$\nWe are asked to find the expected value of the random variable $Y = \\max(X_1, X_2)$. The expectation of a discrete random variable is given by $E[Y] = \\sum_{k} k \\cdot P(Y=k)$. The possible values for $Y$ are also in the set $\\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$.\n\nTo find the PMF of $Y$, $P(Y=k)$, it is often easier to first find its cumulative distribution function (CDF), $F_Y(k) = P(Y \\le k)$.\nThe event $Y \\le k$ is equivalent to the event $\\max(X_1, X_2) \\le k$. The maximum of two values is less than or equal to $k$ if and only if both values are less than or equal to $k$. Therefore:\n$$F_Y(k) = P(Y \\le k) = P(\\max(X_1, X_2) \\le k) = P(X_1 \\le k \\text{ and } X_2 \\le k)$$\nSince $X_1$ and $X_2$ are independent, we can write:\n$$F_Y(k) = P(X_1 \\le k) \\cdot P(X_2 \\le k)$$\nFor a discrete uniform distribution on $\\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$, the probability $P(X_i \\le k)$ is the sum of the probabilities of outcomes from 1 to $k$. Since there are $k$ such outcomes, each with probability $1/N$, we have:\n$$P(X_i \\le k) = \\sum_{j=1}^{k} P(X_i = j) = \\sum_{j=1}^{k} \\frac{1}{N} = \\frac{k}{N}$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the CDF of $Y$:\n$$F_Y(k) = \\left(\\frac{k}{N}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{k}{N}\\right) = \\frac{k^2}{N^2}$$\nThis CDF is valid for $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$.\n\nNow we can find the PMF, $P(Y=k)$, using the relation $P(Y=k) = F_Y(k) - F_Y(k-1)$ for $k \\ge 1$. For $k=1$, $P(Y=1) = F_Y(1) = 1/N^2$. For $k > 1$:\n$$P(Y=k) = \\frac{k^2}{N^2} - \\frac{(k-1)^2}{N^2} = \\frac{k^2 - (k^2 - 2k + 1)}{N^2} = \\frac{2k - 1}{N^2}$$\nNote that this formula also works for $k=1$, since $(2(1)-1)/N^2 = 1/N^2$. Thus, the PMF is $P(Y=k) = \\frac{2k-1}{N^2}$ for $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the expected value of $Y$ using its definition:\n$$E[Y] = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} k \\cdot P(Y=k) = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} k \\cdot \\frac{2k-1}{N^2}$$\n$$E[Y] = \\frac{1}{N^2} \\sum_{k=1}^{N} (2k^2 - k) = \\frac{1}{N^2} \\left( 2\\sum_{k=1}^{N} k^2 - \\sum_{k=1}^{N} k \\right)$$\nWe use the standard formulas for the sum of the first $N$ integers and the sum of the first $N$ squares:\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{N} k = \\frac{N(N+1)}{2}$$\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{N} k^2 = \\frac{N(N+1)(2N+1)}{6}$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $E[Y]$:\n$$E[Y] = \\frac{1}{N^2} \\left( 2 \\cdot \\frac{N(N+1)(2N+1)}{6} - \\frac{N(N+1)}{2} \\right)$$\n$$E[Y] = \\frac{1}{N^2} \\left( \\frac{N(N+1)(2N+1)}{3} - \\frac{N(N+1)}{2} \\right)$$\nFactor out the common term $\\frac{N(N+1)}{N^2} = \\frac{N+1}{N}$:\n$$E[Y] = \\frac{N+1}{N} \\left( \\frac{2N+1}{3} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)$$\nFind a common denominator for the terms in the parenthesis:\n$$E[Y] = \\frac{N+1}{N} \\left( \\frac{2(2N+1) - 3(1)}{6} \\right) = \\frac{N+1}{N} \\left( \\frac{4N+2 - 3}{6} \\right)$$\n$$E[Y] = \\frac{N+1}{N} \\left( \\frac{4N-1}{6} \\right)$$\nExpanding the numerator gives the final expression:\n$$E[Y] = \\frac{(N+1)(4N-1)}{6N} = \\frac{4N^2 - N + 4N - 1}{6N} = \\frac{4N^2 + 3N - 1}{6N}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{4N^{2} + 3N - 1}{6N}}$$", "id": "1622946"}, {"introduction": "Having tackled a discrete scenario, we now turn our attention to the continuous domain.
