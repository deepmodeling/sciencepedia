That is, we must check if $f_{X,Y}(x,y) = f_X(x)f_Y(y)$ for all $x$ and $y$.\n\nFirst, let's define the joint PDF, $f_{X,Y}(x,y)$. The point $(X,Y)$ is chosen uniformly from a circular disk of radius $R$. The area of this disk is $A = \\pi R^2$. Since the distribution is uniform, the PDF must be a constant, $c$, over the disk and zero elsewhere. The value of this constant is determined by the normalization condition that the total probability must be 1.\n$$ \\iint_{x^2+y^2 \\le R^2} f_{X,Y}(x,y) \\,dx\\,dy = 1 $$\n$$ \\iint_{x^2+y^2 \\le R^2} c \\,dx\\,dy = 1 $$\n$$ c \\cdot (\\text{Area of disk}) = 1 $$\n$$ c \\cdot (\\pi R^2) = 1 \\implies c = \\frac{1}{\\pi R^2} $$\nSo, the joint PDF is:\n$$ f_{X,Y}(x,y) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{\\pi R^2} & \\text{if } x^2+y^2 \\le R^2 \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} $$\nThe set of points where the PDF is non-zero, $\\{(x,y) | x^2+y^2 \\le R^2\\}$, is called the support of the distribution.\n\nA necessary condition for two continuous random variables to be independent is that the support of their joint distribution must be a Cartesian product of their individual supports. In other words, the support region must be a rectangle (possibly infinite) with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.\n\nLet's find the support for $X$ and $Y$ individually.\nThe possible values for $X$ range from $-R$ to $R$. So, the support of $X$ is the interval $[-R, R]$.\nThe possible values for $Y$ also range from $-R$ to $R$. So, the support of $Y$ is the interval $[-R, R]$.\n\nThe Cartesian product of these individual supports is the set of all points $(x,y)$ such that $x \\in [-R, R]$ and $y \\in [-R, R]$. This region is a square with vertices at $(R,R)$, $(R,-R)$, $(-R,-R)$, and $(-R,R)$.\n\nThe support of the joint distribution $f_{X,Y}(x,y)$ is the circular disk defined by $x^2+y^2 \\le R^2$.\n\nSince the support of the joint distribution (a disk) is not the same as the Cartesian product of the marginal supports (a square), the random variables $X$ and $Y$ cannot be independent.\n\nTo illustrate this dependence, consider a specific value for $X$. If we know that $X = 0.9R$, the possible values of $Y$ are constrained by the inequality $(0.9R)^2 + y^2 \\le R^2$, which means $y^2 \\le R^2 - 0.81R^2 = 0.19R^2$. So, $Y$ must be in the interval $[-\\sqrt{0.19}R, \\sqrt{0.19}R]$. If we know $X=R$, then $Y$ must be $0$.

This is the correct reason for their dependence, as explained above.\nB. Independence is not guaranteed by a uniform distribution. The geometry of the support region is critical. This statement is false.\nC. While it is true that the marginal distributions are not uniform (for instance, $f_X(x) = \\frac{2\\sqrt{R^2-x^2}}{\\pi R^2}$ for $x \\in [-R,R]$), this is a consequence of the geometry, not the fundamental reason for dependence. The core reason is the non-rectangular support.\nD. Symmetry of the support region does not imply independence. This statement is false.\nE. This statement confuses independence with correlation. Two variables can be uncorrelated (correlation coefficient is zero) but still be dependent. For $X$ and $Y$ in this problem, their covariance and thus correlation coefficient is indeed zero due to symmetry, but as we've shown, they are dependent. Therefore, a zero correlation coefficient does not imply independence. This statement is false.\n\nThe correct conclusion is that $X$ and $Y$ are dependent, and the fundamental reason is that the domain of their joint distribution is a disk, which is not a rectangular region.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1308140"}]}
