The propensity parameters are consistent with established values, and the concept is scientifically plausible. While the definitions for the score $S$ and the \"perfect helix\" criterion are simplifications of the full Chou–Fasman algorithm, they do not violate fundamental principles. They constitute a valid, self-contained model for a pedagogical problem.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is a clearly defined mathematical optimization problem. It asks for the maximum of a function over a well-defined domain. A unique maximum exists and can be determined from the given data. All necessary information is provided.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, unambiguous language. All terms are either standard or explicitly defined.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded, and objective question. A solution will now be derived.\n\nThe objective is to maximize the value of $\\ln S$, where $S$ is the Chou–Fasman helix score for a peptide of length $20$. The score $S$ is given by the product of the individual amino acid propensities:\n$$\nS = \\prod_{i=1}^{20} P_{\\alpha}(a_{i})\n$$\nThe quantity to be maximized is the natural logarithm of $S$:\n$$\n\\ln S = \\ln\\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{20} P_{\\alpha}(a_{i})\\right)\n$$\nUsing the fundamental property of logarithms that the logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms, we can rewrite the expression as:\n$$\n\\ln S = \\sum_{i=1}^{20} \\ln(P_{\\alpha}(a_{i}))\n$$\nThe maximization of $\\ln S$ is subject to the constraint that for every amino acid $a_i$ in the sequence, its propensity must satisfy the condition for a \"perfect, uninterrupted alpha-helix\":\n$$\nP_{\\alpha}(a_{i}) > 1.00 \\quad \\text{for all } i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 20\\}\n$$\nTo maximize the sum $\\sum_{i=1}^{20} \\ln(P_{\\alpha}(a_{i}))$, we must maximize each term in the sum independently. This is because the choice of amino acid at one position $i$ does not constrain the choice of amino acid at any other position $j$.\n\nThe natural logarithm function, $\\ln(x)$, is a strictly monotonically increasing function for all $x > 0$. Therefore, maximizing the value of $\\ln(P_{\\alpha}(a_{i}))$ is equivalent to maximizing the value of the propensity $P_{\\alpha}(a_{i})$ itself.\n\nWe must first identify the subset of amino acids that satisfy the constraint $P_{\\alpha}(a) > 1.00$. Examining the provided list of propensity values, we find the following amino acids are permitted:\n- Alanine (A): $P_{\\alpha}(\\text{A}) = 1.42$\n- Aspartic acid (D): $P_{\\alpha}(\\text{D}) = 1.01$\n- Glutamine (Q): $P_{\\alpha}(\\text{Q}) = 1.11$\n- Glutamic acid (E): $P_{\\alpha}(\\text{E}) = 1.51$\n- Isoleucine (I): $P_{\\alpha}(\\text{I}) = 1.08$\n- Leucine (L): $P_{\\alpha}(\\text{L}) = 1.21$\n- Lysine (K): $P_{\\alpha}(\\text{K}) = 1.16$\n- Methionine (M): $P_{\\alpha}(\\text{M}) = 1.45$\n- Phenylalanine (F): $P_{\\alpha}(\\text{F}) = 1.13$\n- Tryptophan (W): $P_{\\alpha}(\\text{W}) = 1.08$\n- Valine (V): $P_{\\alpha}(\\text{V}) = 1.06$\nNote that Histidine (H) with $P_{\\alpha}(\\text{H}) = 1.00$ is excluded as the inequality is strict.\n\nTo maximize each term $\\ln(P_{\\alpha}(a_{i}))$, we must choose the amino acid from this allowed set that has the highest propensity value. Let this maximum propensity be denoted by $P_{\\alpha, \\text{max}}$. By inspection of the values listed above:\n$$\nP_{\\alpha, \\text{max}} = \\max\\{1.42, 1.01, 1.11, 1.51, 1.08, 1.21, 1.16, 1.45, 1.13, 1.08, 1.06\\} = 1.51\n$$\nThis maximum propensity value corresponds to the amino acid Glutamic acid (E).\n\nThe maximum value of the sum is achieved when, for every position $i$ from $1$ to $20$, we choose the amino acid with this maximum propensity. Thus, we set $P_{\\alpha}(a_i) = P_{\\alpha, \\text{max}} = 1.51$ for all $i$. The optimal peptide is a homopolymer of Glutamic acid, $(\\text{E})_{20}$.\n\nThe maximum value of $\\ln S$, denoted $(\\ln S)_{\\text{max}}$, is then:\n$$\n(\\ln S)_{\\text{max}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{20} \\ln(P_{\\alpha, \\text{max}}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{20} \\ln(1.51) = 20 \\ln(1.51)\n$$\nWe now compute the numerical value.\n$$\n\\ln(1.51) \\approx 0.41211327\n$$\n$$\n(\\ln S)_{\\text{max}} \\approx 20 \\times 0.41211327 = 8.2422654\n$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $8$, $2$, $4$, and $2$. The fifth digit is $2$, which is less than $5$, so we round down (i.e., truncate).\n$$\n(\\ln S)_{\\text{max}} \\approx 8.242\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{8.242}\n$$", "id": "2421467"}, {"introduction": "While individual residue propensities are important, the Garnier–Osguthorpe–Robson (GOR) method advances this idea by considering that the local sequence context matters.
