According to the problem statement, any term involving such a restraint must include $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{release}}^{\\circ}$ for a valid standard-state cycle. The proper expression for the standard binding free energy is $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{\\circ}(X) = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{decouple}}^{\\mathrm{solv}}(X) - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{decouple}}^{\\mathrm{bound}}(X) - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{release}}^{\\circ}$.

This would mean that the free energy of solvation is identical for ligands $L$ and $L^{\\ast}$. Since $L^{\\ast}$ is constructed by adding a substituent $\\chi$ to $L$, their chemical properties and interactions with the solvent (water) will necessarily differ. Thus, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv}}(L\\to L^{\\ast}) \\neq 0$ in any non-trivial case.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nE. $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}=\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bound}}(L\\to L^{\\ast})-\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv}}(L\\to L^{\\ast})+\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{release}}^{\\circ}$.\nThis option incorrectly adds a standard state correction term $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{release}}^{\\circ}$ to the correct relative free energy expression. As discussed previously, for a relative calculation between two related ligands with a common core, the entropic changes associated with binding are assumed to cancel. The alchemical morphing pathway as defined does not require the use of the types of restraints whose release is corrected by $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{release}}^{\\circ}$.

Provide a search interval (e.g., $[-100, 100]$) where the root is expected to lie.\n3.  The algorithm will iteratively narrow this interval until it converges on the value of $\\Delta f$ that makes $g(\\Delta f) \\approx 0$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate $\\Delta f$ for Both Environments**\n\nThis root-finding procedure must be performed twice for each test case:\n1.  **For the bound environment:** Use the lists $\\{\\Delta u_i^{(0)}\\}_{\\text{bound}}$ and $\\{\\Delta u_j^{(1)}\\}_{\\text{bound}}$ to solve for $\\Delta f_{\\text{bound}}$.\n2.  **For the unbound environment:** Use the lists $\\{\\Delta u_i^{(0)}\\}_{\\text{unbound}}$ and $\\{\\Delta u_j^{(1)}\\}_{\\text{unbound}}$ to solve for $\\Delta f_{\\text{unbound}}$.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the Final $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}$**\n\nOnce you have both dimensionless free energies, you can calculate the final answer using the provided thermodynamic cycle formula:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} = \\left( \\Delta f_{\\text{bound}} - \\Delta f_{\\text{unbound}} \\right) \\times k_B T N_A\n$$\nThe product $k_B N_A$ is the molar gas constant $R \\approx 8.314 \\text{ J} \\cdot \\text{mol}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{K}^{-1}$.\nRemember to convert the final result from Joules per mole to kilojoules per mole by dividing by 1000, and then round to three decimal places as specified.\n\n**Example Calculation Walkthrough (Case 1):**\n1.  $T = 300$ K. $RT \\approx 2494.34$ J/mol.\n2.  **Bound:** $n_0=8, n_1=8, K=\\ln(1)=0$. Solving the BAR equation with the 'bound' data yields $\\Delta f_{\\text{bound}} \\approx -0.768$.\n3.  **Unbound:** $n_0=8, n_1=8, K=\\ln(1)=0$. Solving the BAR equation with the 'unbound' data yields $\\Delta f_{\\text{unbound}} \\approx 0.334$.\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    $$ \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} = (-0.768 - 0.334) \\times 2494.34 \\text{ J/mol} $$\n    $$ \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} = -1.102 \\times 2494.34 \\text{ J/mol} \\approx -2748 \\text{ J/mol} \\approx -2.748 \\text{ kJ/mol} $$\nRepeating this process for all three cases produces the final list of results.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import brentq\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the change in binding free energy for three test cases\n    using the Bennett Acceptance Ratio (BAR) method.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define physical constants\n    K_B = 1.380649e-23  # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n    N_A = 6.02214076e+23 # Avogadro's number in mol^-1\n    R_J_PER_MOL_K = K_B * N_A # Molar gas constant in J/(mol*K)\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            \"T\": 300.0,\n            \"bound\": {\n                \"u0\": [-1.2, -0.8, -1.0, -1.1, -0.9, -1.3, -0.7, -1.0],\n                \"u1\": [-0.4, -0.6, -0.5, -0.7, -0.8, -0.3, -0.6, -0.5],\n            },\n            \"unbound\": {\n                \"u0\": [0.2, 0.1, 0.3, 0.0, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0.3],\n                \"u1\": [0.5, 0.4, 0.6, 0.7, 0.3, 0.5, 0.4, 0.6],\n            },\n        },\n        {\n            \"T\": 300.0,\n            \"bound\": {\n                \"u0\": [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],\n                \"u1\": [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],\n            },\n            \"unbound\": {\n                \"u0\": [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],\n                \"u1\": [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],\n            },\n        },\n        {\n            \"T\": 300.0,\n            \"bound\": {\n                \"u0\": [0.9, 1.1, 0.8, 1.0, 0.7, 1.2],\n                \"u1\": [0.4, 0.3, 0.5],\n            },\n            \"unbound\": {\n                \"u0\": [0.2, 0.3, 0.1, 0.4, 0.2, 0.3],\n                \"u1\": [0.0, 0.1, 0.2],\n            },\n        },\n    ]\n\n    def _bar_objective_function(delta_f, u0, u1, log_n1_over_n0):\n        \"\"\"\n        The objective function for BAR, the root of which is delta_f.\n        g(delta_f) = LHS - RHS from the problem statement.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Arguments for the exponential function\n        arg1 = u0 - delta_f - log_n1_over_n0\n        arg2 = -u1 + delta_f - log_n1_over_n0\n        \n        # Fermi-Dirac-like terms\n        # np.exp handles large negative exponents (result is 0) and large positive\n        # exponents (result is inf), which leads to the correct limit of 0 for 1/inf.\n        lhs = np.sum(1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(arg1)))\n        rhs = np.sum(1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(arg2)))\n        \n        return lhs - rhs\n\n    def calculate_delta_f(u0_list, u1_list):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the dimensionless free energy difference (delta_f)\n        by finding the root of the BAR equation.\n        \"\"\"\n        u0 = np.array(u0_list, dtype=np.float64)\n        u1 = np.array(u1_list, dtype=np.float64)\n        \n        n0 = len(u0)\n        n1 = len(u1)\n        \n        if n0 == 0 or n1 == 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Sample lists cannot be empty.\")\n\n        log_n1_over_n0 = np.log(n1 / n0)\n        \n        # Use brentq a robust root-finding algorithm.
