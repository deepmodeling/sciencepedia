I will first validate the problem statement for scientific soundness and clarity before proceeding.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   **Amino Acid Hydropathy**: Each of the $20$ standard amino acids $a$ is mapped to a Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy index $h(a)$. The specific values are provided.\n-   **Input**: An amino acid sequence $x[0], x[1], \\dots, x[N-1]$ of length $N \\ge 1$.\n-   **Signal Generation**: The sequence is converted to a hydropathy signal $H[n] = h(x[n])$.\n-   **Kernel Definition**: A normalized Hann window kernel $K[j]$ of length $L$ is defined for $j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, L-1\\}$.\n    -   Raised-cosine profile: $W[j] = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi j}{L-1}\\right)$.\n    -   Normalization: $K[j] = W[j] / \\sum_{m=0}^{L-1} W[m]$.\n-   **Scoring**: A windowed score $S[i]$ is calculated for each valid starting position $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-L\\}$ by convolving the signal $H$ with the kernel $K$: $S[i] = \\sum_{j=0}^{L-1} K[j] H[i+j]$.\n-   **Thresholding**: A set of window indices $\\mathcal{I}$ is formed where the score exceeds a threshold $\\theta$: $\\mathcal{I} = \\{ i \\mid S[i] \\ge \\theta \\}$.\n-   **Helix Definition**: The set $\\mathcal{I}$ is partitioned into maximal contiguous runs. Each run, with minimal index $i_{\\min}$ and maximal index $i_{\\max}$, defines a predicted helix interval as $[i_{\\min}, i_{\\max} + L - 1]$.\n-   **Filtering**: Predicted helices are discarded if their length, $1 + \\text{end} - \\text{start}$, is less than a minimum length $L_{\\min}$.\n-   **Parameters**: The problem specifies fixed parameters: window length $L = 19$, threshold $\\theta = 1.6$, and minimal helix length $L_{\\min} = 17$.\n-   **Test Cases**: Six specific amino acid sequences are provided for analysis.\n-   **Output Specification**: For each case, report a list of zero-indexed, inclusive integer intervals $[\\text{start}, \\text{end}]$. The final output must be a single line containing a list of these results.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The methodology is a well-established technique in bioinformatics for identifying transmembrane domains. It is based on the principle that transmembrane helices are predominantly composed of hydrophobic amino acids. The Kyte-Doolittle scale is a standard measure of hydropathy, and the use of a sliding window (specifically a Hann window) for smoothing is a standard signal processing technique. The method is scientifically valid.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is formulated with mathematical precision. All parameters and procedures are explicitly defined, ensuring that a unique and stable solution can be computed for any given input sequence.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated objectively, free from ambiguity or subjective claims. The defined algorithm is deterministic.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. I will now proceed with a complete solution.\n\n### Algorithmic Solution\nThe task is to implement a signal processing pipeline to detect hydrophobic regions in a protein sequence, which are characteristic of transmembrane (TM) helices. The algorithm proceeds in several distinct stages.\n\n1.  **Signal Transformation**: The initial input, a symbolic sequence of amino acids, is transformed into a real-valued discrete signal. This is achieved by mapping each amino acid $x[n]$ in the input sequence of length $N$ to its corresponding Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy index $h(x[n])$, producing the numerical signal $H[n]$ for $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$. Positive values indicate hydrophobicity, while negative values indicate hydrophilicity.\n\n2.  **Kernel-Based Smoothing**: Transmembrane helices are extended structures, typically spanning $17$ to $25$ residues. To identify such regions, local hydropathy values must be averaged. This is accomplished by convolving the hydropathy signal $H$ with a smoothing kernel $K$. The problem specifies a window length of $L=19$ residues, which matches the typical length of a TM helix. The kernel is derived from a Hann window profile, given by\n    $$\n    W[j] = \\tfrac{1}{2} - \\tfrac{1}{2}\\cos\\!\\left(\\tfrac{2\\pi j}{L-1}\\right), \\quad j = 0,1,\\dots,L-1.\n    $$\n    This window function gives more weight to residues at the center of the window and less to those at the edges. The kernel $K[j]$ is normalized to have a unit sum, $\\sum_{j=0}^{L-1} K[j] = 1$, by dividing $W[j]$ by the sum $\\sum_{m=0}^{L-1} W[m] = (L-1)/2$. For $L=19$, this sum is $9$. The smoothed hydropathy score at each starting position $i$ of a window is then calculated as:\n    $$\n    S[i] = \\sum_{j=0}^{L-1} K[j] H[i+j].\n    $$\n    This operation is performed for all valid window positions, $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-L\\}$. Computationally, this is a discrete convolution of the signal $H$ with the kernel $K$, which is symmetric ($K[j] = K[L-1-j]$).\n\n3.  **Identification of Hydrophobic Cores**: The score $S[i]$ represents the average hydrophobicity of the window of length $L$ starting at index $i$. A high score suggests a potential TM helix segment. These segments are identified by applying a threshold $\\theta=1.6$. All window start indices $i$ for which $S[i] \\ge \\theta$ are collected into a set $\\mathcal{I}$.\n\n4.  **Delineation of Helix Boundaries**: The set $\\mathcal{I}$ contains the starting indices of all windows deemed sufficiently hydrophobic. A continuous stretch of such windows is inferred to belong to a single TM helix. Therefore, $\\mathcal{I}$ is partitioned into maximal contiguous runs of indices. For each run, we identify its minimum and maximum index, $i_{\\min}$ and $i_{\\max}$. This run signifies a hydrophobic core region spanning from residue $i_{\\min}$ to residue $i_{\\max} + L - 1$. The start of the predicted helix is the start of the first window in the run ($i_{\\min}$), and the end of the helix is the end of the last window in the run ($i_{\\max} + L - 1$).\n\n5.  **Length Filtering**: Biophysically, a TM helix must have a certain minimum length to span the cell membrane. The problem imposes this constraint by specifying a minimum length $L_{\\min}=17$. Any predicted helix interval $[\\text{start}, \\text{end}]$ with a length of $1 + \\text{end} - \\text{start} < L_{\\min}$ is discarded as biologically implausible.\n\nThe final output is the collection of all predicted helix intervals that satisfy the length constraint.

The solution involves finding the most probable hidden state path for each sequence using the Viterbi algorithm and then computing a set of specified statistics from this path.\n\nThe HMM is defined by:\n- A set of $3$ hidden states, $S=\\{I, H, O\\}$, corresponding to inside loop, transmembrane helix, and outside loop, respectively.\n- An initial state distribution $\\pi$ where $\\pi(I)=1$ and $\\pi(H)=\\pi(O)=0$.\n- A state transition matrix $A=(a_{uv})$.\n- A set of emission distributions $b_s(r)$ for each state $s \\in S$ and amino acid $r \\in \\mathcal{A}$.\n\nThe Viterbi algorithm is the standard method for finding the most probable sequence of hidden states, $\\hat{q}_{1:L} = (\\hat{q}_1, ..., \\hat{q}_L)$, that results in a given observed sequence $x_{1:L} = (x_1, ..., x_L)$. This path maximizes the joint probability $\\Pr(q_{1:L}, x_{1:L})$. The algorithm works by dynamic programming, and to prevent numerical underflow with long sequences, computations are performed in log-space.\n\nFirst, we pre-compute the necessary parameters in their logarithmic form.\n\n**1. HMM Parameters in Log-Space**\n\nThe emission probabilities are given by:\n$$b_H(r)=\\frac{\\exp(\\lambda\\,h(r))}{Z_H}, \\quad b_I(r)=b_O(r)=\\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda\\,h(r))}{Z_L}$$\nwith $\\lambda=0.5$. The normalization constants $Z_H$ and $Z_L$ are sums over all $20$ amino acids in the alphabet $\\mathcal{A}$:\n$$Z_H=\\sum_{a\\in\\mathcal{A}}\\exp(\\lambda\\,h(a)), \\qquad Z_L=\\sum_{a\\in\\mathcal{A}}\\exp(-\\lambda\\,h(a))$$\nUsing the provided hydropathy values $h(r)$, these constants are calculated to be $Z_H \\approx 53.0031$ and $Z_L \\approx 35.1311$.\n\nThe log-emission probabilities are:\n$$\\log b_H(r) = \\lambda h(r) - \\log Z_H$$\n$$\\log b_I(r) = \\log b_O(r) = -\\lambda h(r) - \\log Z_L$$\n\nThe log-transition probabilities, $\\log a_{uv}$, are computed from the given matrix $A$.

The Viterbi Algorithm**\n\nLet $V_t(s)$ be the maximum log-probability of any path of length $t$ ending in state $s \\in S$ and emitting the prefix $x_{1:t}$. We also maintain a matrix of backpointers, $ptr_t(s)$, to reconstruct the path.\n\n- **Initialization ($t=1$):** For each state $s \\in S$,\n$$V_1(s) = \\log \\pi(s) + \\log b_s(x_1)$$\nGiven the initial distribution, this simplifies to $V_1(I) = \\log b_I(x_1)$ and $V_1(H) = V_1(O) = -\\infty$.\n\n- **Recurrence ($t=2, \\dots, L$):** For each state $s \\in S$,\n$$V_t(s) = \\log b_s(x_t) + \\max_{u \\in S} \\{ V_{t-1}(u) + \\log a_{us} \\}$$\n$$ptr_t(s) = \\arg\\max_{u \\in S} \\{ V_{t-1}(u) + \\log a_{us} \\}$$\n\n- **Termination:** The log-probability of the most likely path is the maximum probability in the final column of the Viterbi matrix:\n$$\\log \\Pr(\\hat{q}_{1:L}, x_{1:L}) = \\max_{s \\in S} \\{ V_L(s) \\}$$\nThe final state of the path is:\n$$\\hat{q}_L = \\arg\\max_{s \\in S} \\{ V_L(s) \\}$$\n\n- **Path Backtracking:** The rest of the path is found by following the backpointers from the end:\n$$\\hat{q}_t = ptr_{t+1}(\\hat{q}_{t+1}) \\quad \\text{for } t = L-1, \\dots, 1$$\n\n**3. Computation of Required Statistics**\n\nOnce the optimal path $\\hat{q}_{1:L}$ is determined, the following four statistics are computed for each sequence:\n\n- $N_H$: The number of helix segments. This is calculated by counting the number of maximal contiguous blocks of state $H$ in the path $\\hat{q}_{1:L}$.\n- $L_{\\max}$: The length of the longest helix segment. This is the maximum length of any contiguous block of state $H$ in $\\hat{q}_{1:L}$. If no $H$ state is present, this is $0$.\n- $f_{\\text{charged}\\to H}$: The fraction of charged residues ($\\{\\text{D},\\text{E},\\text{K},\\text{R},\\text{H}\\}$) that are assigned to state $H$. This is computed as:\n$$f_{\\text{charged}\\to H} = \\frac{|\\{ i \\mid x_i \\in \\{\\text{D},\\text{E},\\text{K},\\text{R},\\text{H}\\} \\text{ and } \\hat{q}_i=H\\}|}{|\\{ i \\mid x_i \\in \\{\\text{D},\\text{E},\\text{K},\\text{R},\\text{H}\\}\\}|}$$\nIf the denominator is $0$, the fraction is defined as $0$.\n- $\\ell$: The average log joint probability per residue, calculated as:\n$$\\ell = \\frac{1}{L} \\max_{s \\in S} \\{ V_L(s) \\}$$\n\nBy implementing the Viterbi algorithm and the statistics calculation procedures, we process each of the $4$ test sequences to obtain the final results.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the HMM Viterbi path and statistics problem.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
