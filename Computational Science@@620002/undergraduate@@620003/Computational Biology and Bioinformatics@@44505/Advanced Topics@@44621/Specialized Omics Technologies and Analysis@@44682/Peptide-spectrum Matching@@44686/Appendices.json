SILAC is a widely used metabolic labeling technique. The mass shift provided for $^{13}\\mathrm{C}_{6}{}^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{4}$-Arginine ($+10.008$ Da) is the correct nominal mass difference used in practice (the precise monoisotopic mass difference is $6 \\times (\\text{mass}(^{13}\\mathrm{C}) - \\text{mass}(^{12}\\mathrm{C})) + 4 \\times (\\text{mass}(^{15}\\mathrm{N}) - \\text{mass}(^{14}\\mathrm{N})) \\approx 10.00827$ Da). The description of trypsin specificity is correct. The overall workflow of mixing populations and performing LC-MS/MS is standard methodology.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It asks for the optimal search parameter configuration for a clearly defined experimental setup. There is a standard and computationally accepted \"best practice\" for this scenario, leading to a unique and meaningful answer.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, objective, and technical language common to the field of bioinformatics and proteomics. There is no ambiguity or subjectivity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is scientifically valid, well-posed, and unambiguous. I will proceed to the solution.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe goal of a database search is to match experimental MS/MS spectra to theoretical peptide sequences from a database. In this experiment, the sample contains a $1:1$ mixture of proteomes from two cell populations.\n1.  **Light Population**: All proteins are composed of naturally abundant isotopes. An Arginine-containing peptide has a \"light\" mass, $M_{light}$.\n2.  **Heavy Population**: All Arginine residues in all proteins have been replaced by the heavy isotopic variant, $^{13}\\mathrm{C}_{6}{}^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{4}$-Arginine. A peptide containing $n$ Arginine residues will have a \"heavy\" mass, $M_{heavy} = M_{light} + n \\times 10.008$ Da.\n\nSince the sample is a mixture, the mass spectrometer will measure precursor ions and fragment ions for *both* the light and heavy versions of each Arginine-containing peptide. The database search software must therefore be configured to search for both possibilities.\n\nWe must consider the types of modifications in search software:\n-   A **fixed modification** tells the software that *every* instance of a specified amino acid is modified. If we were to set the $+10.008$ Da shift as a fixed modification on Arginine, the software would only search for heavy peptides. This would result in the failure to identify any peptides from the light population, which constitute half of the sample. This approach is incorrect.\n-   A **variable modification** (or potential modification) tells the software to consider both possibilities: the amino acid may be unmodified, or it may be modified. When the software considers a theoretical peptide from the database, it will calculate theoretical fragment masses for all combinations of the variable modification. For a peptide with one Arginine, it will search for the unmodified (light) form and the modified (heavy) form. For a peptide with two Arginines, it will search for forms with zero, one, or two modifications. This search strategy correctly covers the biologically relevant forms present in the sample: the fully light form (zero modifications) and the fully heavy form (all Arginines modified).\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate way to configure the search is to define the $+10.008$ Da mass shift as a **variable modification on Arginine**.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Add $+10.008$ Da as a variable modification on Arginine residues.**\nThis configuration allows the search engine to test for the presence or absence of the heavy label on each Arginine residue in a theoretical peptide. This enables the identification of peptides from both the light population (where no modifications will be found on Arginines) and the heavy population (where all Arginines will be found to be modified). This is the standard and correct procedure for analyzing such SILAC data.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Add $+10.008$ Da as a fixed modification on Arginine residues and as a variable modification on peptide N-termini.**\nSetting the Arginine modification as *fixed* is fundamentally incorrect, as it would preclude the identification of the light peptides. The sample is explicitly a $1:1$ mixture of light and heavy cells. Furthermore, the label is incorporated into Arginine residues during protein synthesis, not added to the peptide N-terminus post-translationally or chemically. The N-terminal modification is irrelevant and factually wrong for this experimental design.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Do not add any modifications; instead, increase the precursor mass tolerance to encompass the $+10.008$ Da shift.**\nPrecursor mass tolerance is a narrow window (typically in the parts-per-million, ppm, range) used to match the high-accuracy experimental precursor mass to a theoretical mass. A mass shift of $+10.008$ Da is enormous compared to typical tolerances. For a peptide of mass $1200$ Da, this shift corresponds to $(10.008 / 1200) \\times 10^6 \\approx 8340$ ppm. Widening the tolerance to such a degree would cause each experimental spectrum to match a vast number of unrelated peptides, leading to an explosion of ambiguity and false positives. The results would be meaningless. Specific modifications must be handled as discrete mass shifts, not by degrading mass accuracy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Add $+10.008$ Da as a variable modification on both Lysine and Arginine residues, because trypsin cleaves after both.**\nThe problem statement explicitly specifies that the heavy label is $^{13}\\mathrm{C}_{6}{}^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{4}$-**Arginine** and, critically, that **\"No Lysine labeling was used.\"** Therefore, instructing the software to search for a modification on Lysine is contrary to the known experimental facts. While trypsin's cleavage specificity is related to both amino acids, the isotopic labeling is not. This would needlessly increase the search space and complexity, and is factually incorrect for the given setup.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2433525"}, {"introduction": "After a search engine scores thousands of potential peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs), the crucial next step is to statistically distinguish between correct and incorrect identifications.

At the fixed score threshold $S$, the estimated $\\widehat{\\mathrm{FDR}}$ is higher for Database B than for Database A.**\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we must calculate the estimated FDR for each database using the provided formula, $\\widehat{\\mathrm{FDR}} = D/T$.\n\nFor Database A:\n$$ \\widehat{\\mathrm{FDR}}_A = \\frac{D_A}{T_A} = \\frac{284}{28400} = \\frac{1}{100} = 0.01 = 1\\% $$\n\nFor Database B:\n$$ \\widehat{\\mathrm{FDR}}_B = \\frac{D_B}{T_B} = \\frac{478}{23900} = \\frac{2 \\times 239}{100 \\times 239} = \\frac{2}{100} = 0.02 = 2\\% $$\n\nComparing the two values, we find that $\\widehat{\\mathrm{FDR}}_B (2\\%) > \\widehat{\\mathrm{FDR}}_A (1\\%)$. The statement is a direct consequence of the data.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. If the score thresholds are adjusted independently to achieve $\\widehat{\\mathrm{FDR}} = 1\\%$ in each search, Database B will yield fewer accepted PSMs than Database A.**\n\nFor search A, the data shows that at score threshold $S$, we achieve $\\widehat{\\mathrm{FDR}}_A = 1\\%$ with $T_A = 28400$ accepted PSMs.\n\nFor search B, at the same score threshold $S$, the FDR is $\\widehat{\\mathrm{FDR}}_B = 2\\%$. To achieve a lower, more stringent FDR of $1\\%$, one must increase the score threshold to a new value, $S' > S$. Applying a higher score threshold will invariably reduce the number of accepted PSMs, both target and decoy.\nLet $T'_B$ be the number of accepted target PSMs for Database B at the new threshold $S'$ that yields $\\widehat{\\mathrm{FDR}} = 1\\%$. Since $S' > S$, the number of accepted PSMs must be smaller than at threshold $S$. Therefore, $T'_B < T_B$.\nFrom the given data, $T_B = 23900$. So, we have $T'_B < 23900$.\nWe need to compare $T'_B$ with $T_A = 28400$.\nSince $T'_B < 23900$ and $23900 < 28400$, it follows logically that $T'_B < T_A$.\nThis result is also conceptually sound: a correct-species search should identify more true peptides at a given confidence level (FDR) than an incorrect-species search.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Using Database B will reduce the number of accepted decoy PSMs at threshold $S$ because homologous target sequences outcompete decoys.**\n\nThe statement makes a factual claim: \"Using Database B will reduce the number of accepted decoy PSMs at threshold $S$\". This implies that $D_B < D_A$.\nLet us examine the data provided:\n-   Number of decoy PSMs in search A: $D_A = 284$.\n-   Number of decoy PSMs in search B: $D_B = 478$.\nThe data show that $D_B > D_A$ ($478 > 284$). The claim is directly contradicted by the experimental results presented in the problem statement. The premise of the statement is factually incorrect. Therefore, the entire statement is incorrect, regardless of the validity of the proposed causal mechanism.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Concatenating the rat and mouse proteomes into a single, larger target database and keeping $S$ fixed would necessarily decrease $\\widehat{\\mathrm{FDR}}$ because the true rat peptides are then present in the target.**\n\nLet us analyze the proposed scenario. A new database is formed by concatenating the rat and mouse proteomes. The size of the target database is approximately doubled. The corresponding decoy database would also be doubled in size to maintain the target-decoy size ratio.\nThe $\\widehat{\\mathrm{FDR}}$ is given by $\\widehat{\\mathrm{FDR}} = D/T$.\nThe primary effect of increasing the database size is an increased probability of finding a high-scoring random match for any given spectrum. This affects the null distribution of scores. For a fixed score threshold $S$, a larger database (both target and decoy) will produce more random hits above $S$.\nTherefore, the number of decoy hits, $D$, is expected to increase. As a rough approximation, if the decoy database size doubles, the number of decoy hits $D$ at a fixed threshold $S$ would also be expected to roughly double.\nThe number of target hits, $T$, would be at least $T_A$, since all the original rat peptides are still present. Some spectra might find slightly better matches in the mouse proteins, but this effect is unlikely to be as pronounced as the increase in random hits.\nSo, if $D$ approximately doubles while $T$ increases by a smaller factor (or stays roughly the same), the ratio $D/T$ is likely to increase, not decrease.\nThe reasoning \"because the true rat peptides are then present in the target\" is flawed logic. The true rat peptides were already present in Database A, which yielded an $\\widehat{\\mathrm{FDR}}$ of $1\\%$. The critical change is the expansion of the search space, which increases the potential for false positives. The word \"necessarily\" makes the statement extremely strong and, in this case, incorrect. An increase in $\\widehat{\\mathrm{FDR}}$ is the more plausible outcome.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. When the searched target set contains many near-matches that are incorrect for the true species, the equal-probability assumption underlying the target-decoy approach can be violated, causing $\\widehat{\\mathrm{FDR}}$ from Database B to underestimate the true proportion of incorrect target PSMs.**\n\nThis statement addresses a fundamental limitation of the target-decoy approach. The method relies on the assumption that the score distribution of incorrect target matches (false positives) is well-approximated by the score distribution of decoy matches.\nIn Search B, the sample is rat, and the database is mouse. Rat and mouse are closely related, so their proteomes share high sequence homology. A spectrum from a true rat peptide can find a high-scoring match to its mouse ortholog. This match is a false positive in the sense that it is not the correct peptide from the correct species.\nThese homologous mouse peptides are part of the target database. They are not random sequences. Decoy sequences, however, are typically generated by reversing or shuffling, destroying any biological homology.\nConsequently, a spectrum from a rat peptide has a much higher probability of generating a high-scoring match to an incorrect *target* sequence (the mouse homolog) than to a random *decoy* sequence. This violates the core assumption of the target-decoy method.\nThis means the number of high-scoring incorrect targets will be greater than the number of high-scoring decoys ($D_B$).\nThe true FDR is defined as:\n$$ \\mathrm{FDR}_{\\text{true}} = \\frac{\\text{Number of incorrect target PSMs}}{\\text{Total number of target PSMs}} $$\nThe estimated FDR is:\n$$ \\widehat{\\mathrm{FDR}}_B = \\frac{D_B}{T_B} $$\nSince the number of incorrect target PSMs is underestimated by $D_B$, it follows that $\\mathrm{FDR}_{\\text{true}} > \\widehat{\\mathrm{FDR}}_B$. This means the estimated FDR, $\\widehat{\\mathrm{FDR}}_B$, will underestimate the true proportion of incorrect target PSMs. This is a well-documented phenomenon.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A, B, E}$$", "id": "2413468"}]}
