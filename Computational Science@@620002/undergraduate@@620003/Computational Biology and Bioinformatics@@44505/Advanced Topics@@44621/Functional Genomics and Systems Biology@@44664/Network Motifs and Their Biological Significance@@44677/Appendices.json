It is scientifically grounded, mathematically well-posed, and free of contradictions or ambiguity. The definitions of a signed directed graph, a motif template, an induced match, and a sign signature vector are precise and align with established concepts in computational biology and graph theory. The objective, which is to determine the existence of at least two sign-distinct instances of a motif, is a concrete and solvable computational task. We shall proceed with the derivation of a correct and complete algorithm.\n\nThe central task is to determine if a given signed directed network $S$ contains at least two induced instances of a motif template $M$ that differ in their sign patterns. Formally, let $S$ be represented by a sign adjacency matrix of size $n \\times n$ with entries from $\\{-1, 0, +1\\}$, and let $M$ be a binary adjacency matrix of size $k \\times k$ representing the motif topology. We are asked to determine if the set of sign signatures, $\\Sigma_{S,M}$, contains more than one unique element, where $\\Sigma_{S,M} = \\{ \\sigma_M(\\phi) \\mid \\phi \\text{ is an induced match of } M \\text{ in } S \\}$. The problem is thus to compute the truth value of the statement $|\\Sigma_{S,M}| > 1$.\n\nOur algorithm will be constructed directly from these first principles, as required. The foundation of the algorithm is a systematic search for all induced matches of $M$ in $S$. An induced match is an injective map $\\phi$ from the $k$ positions of the template, $\\{0, \\dots, k-1\\}$, to the $n$ nodes of the host graph, $\\{0, \\dots, n-1\\}$. The set of all such injective maps is equivalent to the set of ordered $k$-permutations of the $n$ node indices.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Enumeration of Potential Mappings**: We generate all possible injective mappings from the $k$ template positions to the $n$ graph nodes. This is achieved by iterating through all $k$-permutations of the node set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$. Let $p = (p_0, p_1, \\dots, p_{k-1})$ be such a permutation, defining a candidate mapping $\\phi(i) = p_i$ for $i \\in \\{0, \\dots, k-1\\}$. The total number of such permutations is $P(n,k) = \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$.\n\n2.  **Verification of Induced Match Condition**: For each candidate mapping $\\phi$ (represented by a permutation $p$), we must rigorously verify if it constitutes an induced match. According to the definition, this requires that for every pair of distinct template positions $(i, j)$, an edge exists between $\\phi(i)$ and $\\phi(j)$ in $S$ if and only if an edge exists between $i$ and $j$ in $M$. This translates to the following logical condition which must hold for all $i, j \\in \\{0, \\dots, k-1\\}$ with $i \\neq j$:\n    $$\n    (M[i,j] = 1) \\iff (S[\\phi(i), \\phi(j)] \\neq 0)\n    $$\n    If this condition is violated for even a single pair $(i,j)$, the mapping $\\phi$ is not an induced match, and we discard it and proceed to the next permutation.\n\n3.  **Extraction and Collection of Signatures**: If a mapping $\\phi$ satisfies the induced match condition for all $k(k-1)$ distinct position pairs, it is a valid match. We then proceed to extract its sign signature vector, $\\sigma_M(\\phi)$.\n    - We first establish a canonical ordering for the edges of the template $M$. Let $E_M = \\{(i,j) \\mid M[i,j] = 1, 0 \\le i, j < k\\}$. We order the elements of $E_M$ lexicographically. Let this ordered sequence be $(e_1, e_2, \\dots, e_m)$, where $m = |E_M|$.\n    - For each edge $e_r = (i, j)$ in this canonical sequence, we find the corresponding sign $S[\\phi(i), \\phi(j)]$.\n    - The sign signature $\\sigma_M(\\phi)$ is the tuple of these signs, collected in the canonical order: $(\\text{sign}(S, \\phi, e_1), \\dots, \\text{sign}(S, \\phi, e_m))$.\n    - We maintain a set data structure, denoted $\\mathcal{F}$, to store the unique sign signatures discovered so far. Upon finding a valid match and constructing its signature, we add the signature to $\\mathcal{F}$.\n\n4.  **Termination Condition**: The primary objective is to determine if more than one unique signature exists. Therefore, after adding a new signature to $\\mathcal{F}$, we check its size. If at any point $|\\mathcal{F}| > 1$, we have proven the existence of at least two sign-distinct instances (an iso-motif). The algorithm can then immediately terminate its search for the given $(S, M)$ pair and report a result of `True`. If the enumeration of all $P(n,k)$ permutations completes and $|\\mathcal{F}|$ remains less than or equal to $1$, it signifies that all found instances of the motif (if any) share the same sign pattern. In this case, the result is `False`.\n\nThis brute-force, definition-driven approach guarantees correctness, as it exhaustively checks all possibilities without relying on potentially fallible heuristics. For the specified test cases, where $n$ and $k$ are small, this method is computationally feasible. For example, in Case 2 with $n=6$ and $k=3$, the number of permutations is $P(6,3) = 120$, and for each, we perform $k(k-1)=6$ checks, which is a trivial computational load.\n\nApplying this algorithm to the test cases:\n- Case 1: The host graph contains two FFLs, at nodes $\\{0,1,2\\}$ and $\\{2,3,4\\}$. Both yield the signature $(+1, +1, +1)$. The set of signatures $\\mathcal{F}$ never exceeds size one. Result: `False`.\n- Case 2: The graph contains two FFLs. The one at $\\{0,1,2\\}$ has signature $(+1, -1, +1)$, and the one at $\\{3,4,5\\}$ has signature $(+1, +1, +1)$. The set $\\mathcal{F}$ grows to size two. Result: `True`.\n- Case 3: The graph topology does not permit any FFLs. The set $\\mathcal{F}$ remains empty. Result: `False`.\n- Case 4: The subgraph on nodes $\\{0,1,2\\}$ is not an *induced* FFL because there is an extra edge $S[2,0]=+1$ where the template demands a non-edge ($M[2,0]=0$). No induced matches are found. Result: `False`.\n- Case 5: The graph contains two induced $3$-node chains. The match on nodes $\\{0,1,2\\}$ gives signature $(+1,+1)$. The match on nodes $\\{3,4,0\\}$ gives signature $(-1,+1)$. The set $\\mathcal{F}$ reaches size two. Result: `True`.\n\nThe algorithm is thus verified against all provided scenarios.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the iso-motif detection problem for a hardcoded test suite.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1: Two identical FFLs, no iso-motif\n        {\n            \"S_info\": {\"n\": 5, \"edges\": [(0, 1, 1), (1, 2, 1), (0, 2, 1), (2, 3, 1), (3, 4, 1), (2, 4, 1)]},\n            \"M_info\": {\"k\": 3, \"edges\": [(0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 2)]},\n        },\n        # Case 2: Two different FFLs, iso-motif exists\n        {\n            \"S_info\": {\"n\": 6, \"edges\": [(0, 1, 1), (1, 2, 1), (0, 2, -1), (3, 4, 1), (4, 5, 1), (3, 5, 1)]},\n            \"M_info\": {\"k\": 3, \"edges\": [(0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 2)]},\n        },\n        # Case 3: No FFLs present\n        {\n            \"S_info\": {\"n\": 4, \"edges\": [(0, 1, 1), (1, 2, -1), (2, 3, 1)]},\n            \"M_info\": {\"k\": 3, \"edges\": [(0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 2)]},\n        },\n        # Case 4: FFL topology present but not an induced match\n        {\n            \"S_info\": {\"n\": 3, \"edges\": [(0, 1, 1), (1, 2, 1), (0, 2, 1), (2, 0, 1)]},\n            \"M_info\": {\"k\": 3, \"edges\": [(0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 2)]},\n        },\n        # Case 5: Different motif (3-chain), iso-motif exists\n        {\n            \"S_info\": {\"n\": 5, \"edges\": [(0, 1, 1), (1, 2, 1), (3, 4, -1), (4, 0, 1)]},\n            \"M_info\": {\"k\": 3, \"edges\": [(0, 1), (1, 2)]},\n        },\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        # Build host graph matrix S\n        n = case[\"S_info\"][\"n\"]\n        s_edges = case[\"S_info\"][\"edges\"]\n        S = np.zeros((n, n), dtype=int)\n        for u, v, sign in s_edges:\n            S[u, v] = sign\n\n        # Build motif template matrix M\n        k = case[\"M_info\"][\"k\"]\n        m_edges = case[\"M_info\"][\"edges\"]\n        M = np.zeros((k, k), dtype=int)\n        for i, j in m_edges:\n            M[i, j] = 1\n\n        # Execute the detection logic for the current case\n        has_iso_motif = find_iso_motifs(S, M, n, k)\n        results.append(has_iso_motif)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\ndef find_iso_motifs(S, M, n, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines if a host graph S contains iso-motifs for a template M.\n\n    An iso-motif exists if there are at least two induced matches of M in S\n    with distinct sign signature vectors.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Establish canonical order of template edges (lexicographic)\n    template_edges = []\n    for i in range(k):\n        for j in range(k):\n            if M[i, j] == 1:\n                template_edges.append((i, j))\n\n    found_signatures = set()\n    node_indices = range(n)\n\n    # Iterate through all k-permutations of the n host nodes\n    # Each permutation represents a potential injective mapping phi\n    for p in permutations(node_indices, k):\n        # p is the mapping: template position i -> host node p[i]\n        \n        is_induced_match = True\n        # Verify the induced match condition for all pairs of template positions\n        for i in range(k):\n            for j in range(k):\n                if i == j:\n                    continue\n                \n                # Check if edge existence matches between template and host subgraph\n                template_has_edge = (M[i, j] == 1)\n                host_has_edge = (S[p[i], p[j]] != 0)\n\n                if template_has_edge != host_has_edge:\n                    is_induced_match = False\n                    break\n            if not is_induced_match:\n                break\n        \n        # If it is an induced match, extract and store its signature\n        if is_induced_match:\n            signature = tuple(S[p[i], p[j]] for i, j in template_edges)\n            found_signatures.add(signature)\n            \n            # If we find more than one unique signature, an iso-motif exists\n            if len(found_signatures) > 1:\n                return True\n\n    # If the loop completes, an iso-motif was not found\n    return len(found_signatures) > 1\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2409925"}, {"introduction": "Once a motif is identified, the next question is: what does it do?

The problem contrasts two scenarios for the regulation of gene $B$:\n$1$. The baseline scenario (superscript $(0)$), where $B$ is only regulated by $A$:\n$$\nP_B^{(0)}(A) = \\alpha_B \\, H_{\\mathrm{act}}(A;K_{AB},n_{AB})\n$$\n$2$. The negative autoregulation scenario (superscript $(-)$), where $B$ inhibits its own production:\n$$\nP_B^{(-)}(A,B) = \\alpha_B \\, H_{\\mathrm{act}}(A;K_{AB},n_{AB}) \\, H_{\\mathrm{rep}}(B;K_{BB},n_{BB})\n$$\nHere, $\\alpha_B$ is the maximal production rate, and $H_{\\mathrm{act}}$ and $H_{\\mathrm{rep}}$ are the standard sigmoidal Hill functions for activation and repression, respectively:\n$$\nH_{\\mathrm{act}}(x;K,n) = \\frac{x^n}{K^n + x^n}, \\quad H_{\\mathrm{rep}}(x;K,n) = \\frac{K^n}{K^n + x^n} = \\frac{1}{1+(x/K)^n}\n$$\nThe parameters $K$ and $n$ represent the activation/repression threshold and the Hill coefficient (steepness of the response), respectively.\n\nThe production of $C$ is controlled by both $A$ and $B$ via an AND-logic gate, mathematically implemented as the product of their individual activatory influences:\n$$\nP_C(A,B) = \\alpha_C \\, H_{\\mathrm{act}}(A;K_{AC},n_{AC}) \\, H_{\\mathrm{act}}(B;K_{BC},n_{BC})\n$$\nThis structure, with directed edges $A \\to B \\to C$ and $A \\to C$, defines a type-1 coherent feed-forward loop. The AND-logic requires both $A$ and $B$ to be present to strongly activate $C$. This network topology is known to function as a sign-sensitive delay element, responding to sustained input signals but filtering out short transient pulses.\n\nTo solve this system, we must perform numerical integration. The problem specifies a fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method with a fixed time step $\\Delta t = 0.01$ minutes over the interval $[0, T_{\\max}=100]$. Let the state vector be $\\mathbf{y}(t) = [A(t), B(t), C(t)]^T$. The system of ODEs can be written as $\\frac{d\\mathbf{y}}{dt} = \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{y})$, where for $t \\ge 0$, $u(t)=1$ and the system is autonomous:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{y}) = \\begin{pmatrix} (1 - y_1) / \\tau_A \\\\ (P_B(y_1, y_2) - y_2) / \\tau_B \\\\ (P_C(y_1, y_2) - y_3) / \\tau_C \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe RK4 integration step from time $t_k$ to $t_{k+1} = t_k + \\Delta t$ is computed as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{y}_{k+1} = \\mathbf{y}_k + \\frac{\\Delta t}{6} (\\mathbf{k}_1 + 2\\mathbf{k}_2 + 2\\mathbf{k}_3 + \\mathbf{k}_4)\n$$\nwith increments:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{k}_1 &= \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{y}_k) \\\\\n\\mathbf{k}_2 &= \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{y}_k + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} \\mathbf{k}_1) \\\\\n\\mathbf{k}_3 &= \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{y}_k + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} \\mathbf{k}_2) \\\\\n\\mathbf{k}_4 &= \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{y}_k + \\Delta t \\, \\mathbf{k}_3)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThis procedure is repeated from the initial condition $\\mathbf{y}_0 = [0, 0, 0]^T$ until $t=T_{\\max}$.\n\nUpon obtaining the time series for $C(t)$, we extract three key metrics that characterize the output dynamics:\n$1$. Half-rise time, $t_{50}$: The time required for $C(t)$ to reach $50\\%$ of its final steady-state value, $C_{\\infty}$. We estimate $C_{\\infty} \\approx C(T_{\\max})$. Then $t_{50}$ is the first time $t$ for which $C(t) \\ge 0.5 \\, C_{\\infty}$. Negative autoregulation is known to speed up the response of transcription factors, so we expect $t_{50}^{(-)} < t_{50}^{(0)}$, leading to a negative $\\Delta t_{50}$.\n$2$. Overshoot ratio, $r_{\\mathrm{ov}}$: The maximum relative overshoot above the steady-state value, defined as $r_{\\mathrm{ov}} = [\\max_t C(t) / C_{\\infty}] - 1$. An overshoot can occur in this system due to the interplay of delays in the two paths to $C$.\n$3$. Peak time, $t_{\\mathrm{peak}}$: The time at which $C(t)$ reaches its maximum value, $C_{\\mathrm{peak}} = \\max_t C(t)$. This corresponds to the time of the maximum overshoot, if one exists. If no overshoot occurs, then $t_{\\mathrm{peak}} = T_{\\max}$.\n\nFor each test case, we perform this simulation and analysis twiceâ€”once for the baseline system (scenario $(0)$) and once for the system with negative autoregulation on node $B$ (scenario $(-)$)â€”and compute the differences $\\Delta t_{50} = t_{50}^{(-)} - t_{50}^{(0)}$, $\\Delta r_{\\mathrm{ov}} = r_{\\mathrm{ov}}^{(-)} - r_{\\mathrm{ov}}^{(0)}$, and $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{peak}} = t_{\\mathrm{peak}}^{(-)} - t_{\\mathrm{peak}}^{(0)}$. This allows for a direct quantification of the functional role of negative autoregulation in this FFL context.\n\nThe provided Python code implements this entire procedure.
