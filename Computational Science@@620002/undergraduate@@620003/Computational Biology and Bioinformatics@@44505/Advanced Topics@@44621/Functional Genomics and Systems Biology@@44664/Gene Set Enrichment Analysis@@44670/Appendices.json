Ranks are from $1$ to $N$.\n- A gene set $\\mathcal{S}$ with size $N_H = |\\mathcal{S}| = 1$.\n- The single gene in $\\mathcal{S}$ is located at rank $k$, where $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$.\n- The GSEA exponent is $p \\ge 0$.\n- The running sum $R(i)$ is computed by scanning from $i=1$ to $i=N$.\n- If the $i$-th gene is in $\\mathcal{S}$ (a \"hit\"), the increment is $|r_i|^p / NR$. The term $r_i$ denotes the correlation or metric value for the gene at rank $i$.\n- $NR$ is defined as $NR = \\sum_{g \\in \\mathcal{S}} |r_g|^p$.\n- If the $i$-th gene is not in $\\mathcal{S}$ (a \"miss\"), the decrement is $1/(N - N_H)$.\n- The Enrichment Score is $ES = \\max_{1 \\le i \\le N} R(i)$.\n- The initial condition is implicitly $R(0)=0$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, as it is based on the well-established Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) methodology. The setup with a single-gene set ($N_H=1$) is a simplification that renders the problem analytically tractable, but does not violate any fundamental principles. The problem is well-posed and objective.\n\nA potential ambiguity regarding the correlation values $r_i$ is resolved by careful inspection of the definitions. Since the gene set $\\mathcal{S}$ contains only one gene, which is at rank $k$, let its associated metric value be $r_k$. The normalization factor $NR$ is then $NR = \\sum_{g \\in \\mathcal{S}} |r_g|^p = |r_k|^p$. The increment for a hit, which occurs only at step $i=k$, is calculated as $|r_k|^p / NR = |r_k|^p / |r_k|^p = 1$. This holds for $p > 0$ under the reasonable assumption that the metric value $r_k$ is non-zero. For the case $p=0$, which corresponds to the unweighted GSEA statistic, the increment is $|r_k|^0 / NR = 1 / \\sum_{g \\in \\mathcal{S}} |r_g|^0 = 1 / N_H = 1/1 = 1$. Thus, for any $p \\ge 0$, the increment at a hit is precisely $1$.\n\nThe decrement for a miss is given by $1/(N-N_H)$. With $N_H=1$, this is $1/(N-1)$. This term is undefined if $N=1$. However, if $N=1$, then $N_H=1$ and the set of \"misses\" is empty. The problem implicitly assumes $N > 1$ for the decrement step to be meaningful, which is a standard condition in such analyses. The problem is therefore deemed self-contained and consistent.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nWe define the running sum $R(i)$ starting from $R(0)=0$. The change in the running sum at each step $j \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$ is $\\Delta_j$.\nA \"hit\" occurs only at rank $i=k$. The increment is $\\Delta_k = 1$.\nA \"miss\" occurs at any rank $i \\neq k$. The decrement is $-\\frac{1}{N-N_H}$. Since $N_H=1$, the decrement is $-\\frac{1}{N-1}$.\nSo, $\\Delta_j = 1$ if $j=k$, and $\\Delta_j = -\\frac{1}{N-1}$ if $j \\neq k$.\n\nThe running sum at step $i$ is given by $R(i) = \\sum_{j=1}^{i} \\Delta_j$. We analyze $R(i)$ in three cases based on the value of $i$ relative to $k$.\n\nCase 1: $1 \\le i < k$.\nIn this range, every step is a \"miss\".\n$$R(i) = \\sum_{j=1}^{i} \\left(-\\frac{1}{N-1}\\right) = i \\left(-\\frac{1}{N-1}\\right) = -\\frac{i}{N-1}$$\nSince $i \\ge 1$ and $N > 1$, all values of $R(i)$ in this range are negative. The function is strictly decreasing with $i$. The value just before the hit is $R(k-1) = -\\frac{k-1}{N-1}$.\n\nCase 2: $i=k$.\nThe running sum includes $k-1$ misses and one hit at step $k$.\n$$R(k) = R(k-1) + \\Delta_k = -\\frac{k-1}{N-1} + 1 = \\frac{-(k-1) + (N-1)}{N-1} = \\frac{N-k}{N-1}$$\nSince $1 \\le k \\le N$, we have $0 \\le N-k \\le N-1$, so $0 \\le R(k) \\le 1$.\n\nCase 3: $k < i \\le N$.\nThe running sum at step $i$ is the sum at step $k$ plus the decrements for all steps from $k+1$ to $i$. There are $i-k$ such steps, all of which are misses.\n$$R(i) = R(k) + \\sum_{j=k+1}^{i} \\left(-\\frac{1}{N-1}\\right) = R(k) - \\frac{i-k}{N-1}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $R(k)$:\n$$R(i) = \\frac{N-k}{N-1} - \\frac{i-k}{N-1} = \\frac{(N-k) - (i-k)}{N-1} = \\frac{N-i}{N-1}$$\nFor this range $k < i \\le N$, as $i$ increases, $N-i$ decreases, so $R(i)$ is a strictly decreasing function of $i$. The sequence of values starts at $R(k+1) = \\frac{N-(k+1)}{N-1}$ and ends at $R(N) = \\frac{N-N}{N-1}=0$.\n\nTo find the Enrichment Score, $ES = \\max_{1 \\le i \\le N} R(i)$, we must find the maximum value among the expressions for $R(i)$.\n- For $1 \\le i < k$, $R(i) = -i/(N-1) < 0$.\n- For $i \\ge k$, $R(i) = (N-i)/(N-1)$ for $i>k$ and $R(k)=(N-k)/(N-1)$. Since $i>k$, $N-i < N-k$, which implies $R(i) < R(k)$ for all $i > k$ (assuming $N-1>0$).\nThe sequence of values $R(i)$ for $i \\ge k$ is $R(k), R(k+1), \\dots, R(N)$, which is a strictly decreasing sequence.\nThus, the maximum value in the range $i \\ge k$ is $R(k)$.\nSince all values for $i<k$ are negative and $R(k) \\ge 0$, the global maximum over $1 \\le i \\le N$ must be $R(k)$.\n\nTherefore, the Enrichment Score is:\n$$ES = R(k) = \\frac{N-k}{N-1}$$\nThis expression is a closed-form function dependent only on $N$ and $k$, as required.\nFor verification, if the gene is ranked first ($k=1$), $ES = \\frac{N-1}{N-1} = 1$, the maximum possible score. If the gene is ranked last ($k=N$), $ES = \\frac{N-N}{N-1} = 0$. In this case, $R(i) = -i/(N-1)$ for $i < N$, all negative, and $R(N)=0$, so the maximum is indeed $0$.

The value of $\\hat{p}$ is a function of $b$. The denominator, $10001$, is a positive constant. Therefore, to minimize the value of the fraction $\\hat{p}$, we must minimize the value of its numerator, which is $b + 1$.\n\nThe expression $b+1$ is minimized when $b$ itself is minimized.

It is therefore **valid**. The solution will proceed.\n\n**Derivation of Principles**\n\nThe Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) methodology is built upon several key statistical concepts that must be understood to resolve the apparent discrepancy.\n\n$1$. **The Enrichment Score ($ES$)**: Given a ranked list of all genes $L$ (from most up-regulated to most down-regulated in the 'case' phenotype, for example) and a pre-defined gene set $S$, the analysis proceeds by walking down the list $L$. A running-sum statistic is calculated. This sum is increased for each gene encountered that is a member of $S$ (a 'hit') and decreased for each gene that is not (a 'miss'). The magnitude of the increment for a hit is weighted by the gene's rank correlation. The Enrichment Score, $ES$, is defined as the maximum deviation of this running-sum from zero. An $ES$ value approaching $+1$ indicates that the genes in set $S$ are predominantly found at the top of the ranked list $L$. An $ES$ approaching $-1$ indicates concentration at the bottom. An $ES$ near $0$ indicates a random distribution. The observed $ES \\approx 0.95$ correctly signifies a very strong concentration of the pathway's genes at one end of the list. It is, in essence, a measure of effect size for the gene set.\n\n$2$. **Significance Testing and the Null Distribution**: A large $ES$ is not, in itself, proof of statistical significance. The score's significance is assessed by comparing it to a null distribution. GSEA generates this null distribution by permuting the phenotype labels (case vs. control) a large number of times (e.g., $N = 1000$). For each permutation, the entire gene ranking and subsequent $ES$ calculation for the set $S$ are repeated. This creates a distribution of $ES_{null}$ scores, representing the range of scores that can be expected for this set by chance under the null hypothesis that there is no association between the gene set and the phenotype. The nominal p-value for the set $S$ is the fraction of permutations where $|ES_{null}| \\ge |ES_{obs}|$.\n\n$3$. **Correction for Multiple Hypothesis Testing (FDR)**: In a typical analysis, thousands of gene sets are tested simultaneously. This constitutes a massive multiple testing problem, which mandates a stringent correction. GSEA uses the False Discovery Rate ($FDR$) for this purpose. The procedure involves normalizing the observed $ES$ for each set to account for differences in gene set size. This is done by dividing the observed $ES$ by the mean of the absolute values of the $ES_{null}$ scores for that set, yielding a Normalized Enrichment Score ($NES$). A similar normalization is applied to all $ES_{null}$ scores for all sets. The $FDR$ is then calculated by comparing the observed $NES$ for our pathway of interest against the aggregated distribution of all $NES_{null}$ scores from all sets across all permutations. An $FDR > 0.25$ indicates that if we declare all pathways with an $NES$ at least as large as the one observed to be significant, we expect over $25\\%$ of those declarations to be false positives. By convention, this is not considered statistically significant.\n\nThe core of the problem is to explain why a large effect size ($ES \\approx 0.95$) does not translate to statistical significance ($FDR > 0.25$). This occurs when the observed (and normalized) score, while large in absolute terms, is not sufficiently extreme relative to the null distribution constructed from all tested sets and permutations.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. A large $ES$ indicates strong concentration of the set’s genes near one end of the ranked list, but a high $FDR$ can arise if many gene sets (or phenotype label permutations) attain similar or larger scores; after correcting for multiple testing, the observed enrichment is not statistically significant.\n\nThis statement is a precise and accurate description of the GSEA multiple testing correction procedure. The $ES$ measures concentration, as stated. The statistical significance, quantified by the $FDR$, is determined by comparing the observed Normalized Enrichment Score ($NES$) to a null distribution pooled from all permutations and all tested gene sets. If many other gene sets (in the actual data) or many permuted instances (in the null model) achieve scores comparable to or greater than the one observed for the pathway in question, the finding is not exceptional. The resulting high $FDR$ correctly reflects that the enrichment is not statistically significant after accounting for the full burden of multiple tests.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. This discrepancy occurs only because the number of permutations is too small; as the number of permutations increases, a large $ES$ will always yield a small $FDR$, so the pathway is in fact significantly enriched.\n\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. Increasing the number of permutations improves the resolution and stability of the $p$-value and $FDR$ estimates, but it does not change the underlying statistical reality. If the observed enrichment is not truly significant relative to the null distribution, more permutations will simply converge on a more precise, but still high, $FDR$ value. The claim that a large $ES$ *will always* yield a small $FDR$ with enough permutations is false. It ignores the critical context of the other gene sets being tested and the results from the permutations.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Overlap and co-regulation among gene sets can cause many sets to achieve high scores under the observed ranking, inflating the across-set null and increasing $FDR$; the signal is non-specific and may reflect a broad shift rather than pathway-specific enrichment.\n\nThis statement provides a sophisticated and common biological explanation for the statistical phenomenon. Biological pathways are not independent; they often share genes due to functional relationships. If a set of coregulated genes is strongly perturbed and appears at the top of the ranked list, every gene set containing a substantial fraction of these genes will exhibit a high $ES$. This leads to a situation where many observed sets have high $NES$ values. The $FDR$ calculation correctly captures this non-specificity. The statistical significance of any single set is diminished because the enrichment signal is diluted across many correlated sets. Thus, the high $FDR$ implies the signal is not specific to our single pathway of interest. This is a primary reason why the scenario described in option A occurs.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nD. Because $ES \\in [-1,1]$, values near $1$ guarantee statistical significance; therefore an $FDR > 0.25$ with $ES \\approx 1$ indicates a computational error.\n\nThis statement demonstrates a basic misunderstanding of statistical inference. The magnitude of a statistic ($ES$, an effect size) is distinct from its statistical significance ($p$-value or $FDR$). A large effect can be observed by chance, and its significance can only be judged relative to a proper null distribution and after correcting for multiple comparisons. The range of the $ES$ being $[-1, 1]$ is irrelevant to this principle. Attributing this common and well-understood statistical outcome to a \"computational error\" is unscientific and incorrect.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. Small gene sets can attain extreme $ES$ by chance; after normalizing by gene set size and comparing to a null built from label permutations, the score may be common for sets of similar size, resulting in high $FDR$, so no pathway-level claim should be made.\n\nThis statement identifies another valid mechanism. Due to sampling variability, a small gene set can achieve a very high $ES$ if just a few of its members happen to fall at the top of the ranked list. The GSEA methodology explicitly accounts for this by normalizing the raw $ES$ to produce the $NES$. This normalization is based on the distribution of $ES$ values for sets of a similar size under permutation. If high $ES$ values are common for small sets by chance, the normalization will reduce the score's magnitude, leading to a non-extreme $NES$ and consequently a high $FDR$. The conclusion that no pathway-level claim should be made is the correct interpretation of a high $FDR$.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "2393971"}]}
