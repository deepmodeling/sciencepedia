Raw read counts from sequencing experiments are often confounded by technical factors, such as differing sequencing depths between samples. This hands-on practice [@problem_id:2379247] will guide you through clustering samples using both raw counts and properly normalized, log-transformed data, demonstrating how these preprocessing steps are essential for revealing true biological patterns. By comparing the results, you will gain a concrete understanding of why clustering raw counts can be misleading and how to quantify the difference between two clustering outcomes.", "problem": "You are given several small gene expression matrices intended to model ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA-seq) read counts for multiple samples. Each matrix has genes as rows and samples as columns. For each matrix, you must compute two clusterings of the samples under two data regimes: the unprocessed raw counts and a transformed version that applies library-size normalization followed by a logarithm. You must then quantify how similar the raw and transformed clusterings are, using a mathematically defined index.\n\nDefinitions and requirements:\n\n- Let the raw count matrix be denoted by $X \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}^{g \\times s}$, where $g$ is the number of genes and $s$ is the number of samples. The entry $X_{ij}$ is the nonnegative integer count for gene $i$ in sample $j$.\n\n- Define the per-sample library size as $L_j = \\sum_{i=1}^{g} X_{ij}$ for each sample $j \\in \\{1,\\dots,s\\}$. Define the counts per million (CPM) matrix $C \\in \\mathbb{R}^{g \\times s}$ by\n  $$C_{ij} = \\begin{cases} 10^6 \\cdot \\frac{X_{ij}}{L_j}, & \\text{if } L_j > 0 \\\\ 0, & \\text{if } L_j = 0 \\end{cases}$$\n  Define the log-transformed normalized matrix $Y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{g \\times s}$ by\n  $$Y_{ij} = \\log_2\\big(C_{ij} + 1\\big).$$\n\n- You must cluster the samples (that is, the columns) in both $X$ and $Y$ using two methods:\n  1. $k$-means clustering in $\\mathbb{R}^{g}$ with the standard Euclidean distance $d(\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v}) = \\left\\|\\mathbf{u} - \\mathbf{v}\\right\\|_2$, where $k$ is specified per test case. The initialization must be deterministic: use the first $k$ samples (in column order) as the initial centers. Iterate by alternating assignment and update steps until assignments stabilize or until a maximum of $100$ iterations. If any cluster becomes empty at any iteration, immediately reinitialize its center to the sample with the largest current minimum distance to any existing center. In the case of an exact tie in distances during assignment, assign the sample to the cluster with the smallest index.\n  2. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering with average linkage on the same Euclidean distance, producing exactly $k$ flat clusters by cutting the dendrogram to obtain $k$ clusters using the standard cardinality-based criterion. The clustering must be performed on the sample vectors (columns).\n\n- For each method, compare the cluster labels obtained on $X$ versus those on $Y$ using the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI). Given two clusterings $\\mathcal{U}$ and $\\mathcal{V}$ of $s$ items, let $n_{ij}$ denote the contingency counts, $a_i = \\sum_{j} n_{ij}$, $b_j = \\sum_{i} n_{ij}$, and let\n  $$\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}.$$\n  The Adjusted Rand Index is\n  $$\\mathrm{ARI}(\\mathcal{U},\\mathcal{V}) = \\frac{\\sum_{i,j} \\binom{n_{ij}}{2} - \\left[\\sum_{i} \\binom{a_i}{2} \\sum_{j} \\binom{b_j}{2}\\right] \\Big/ \\binom{s}{2}}{\\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\sum_{i} \\binom{a_i}{2} + \\sum_{j} \\binom{b_j}{2}\\right] - \\left[\\sum_{i} \\binom{a_i}{2} \\sum_{j} \\binom{b_j}{2}\\right] \\Big/ \\binom{s}{2}}.$$\n  If the denominator is zero, define $\\mathrm{ARI} = 1$ if the two partitions are identical and $\\mathrm{ARI} = 0$ otherwise.\n\n- All computations are unitless. Angles are not involved. Round all reported real numbers to $6$ decimal places.\n\nTest suite:\n\nFor each of the following test cases, treat the provided matrix as $X$ and the indicated $k$ as the target number of clusters. In each case, compute two ARI values: first for $k$-means (raw versus transformed), and second for hierarchical (raw versus transformed).\n\n- Test case $1$ (strong library-size effects that obscure relative composition in raw counts):\n  - $X^{(1)}$ has $g=2$ and $s=4$ with columns corresponding to samples $1$ through $4$:\n    - Sample $1$: $\\begin{bmatrix} 100 \\\\ 10 \\end{bmatrix}$,\n    - Sample $2$: $\\begin{bmatrix} 1000 \\\\ 100 \\end{bmatrix}$,\n    - Sample $3$: $\\begin{bmatrix} 10 \\\\ 100 \\end{bmatrix}$,\n    - Sample $4$: $\\begin{bmatrix} 100 \\\\ 1000 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n  - Hence $X^{(1)} = \\begin{bmatrix} 100 & 1000 & 10 & 100 \\\\ 10 & 100 & 100 & 1000 \\end{bmatrix}$, and $k=2$.\n\n- Test case $2$ (zero library size edge case, avoid distance ties):\n  - $X^{(2)}$ has $g=2$ and $s=3$ with columns:\n    - Sample $1$: $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$,\n    - Sample $2$: $\\begin{bmatrix} 12 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$,\n    - Sample $3$: $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 9 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n  - Hence $X^{(2)} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 12 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 9 \\end{bmatrix}$, and $k=2$.\n\n- Test case $3$ (balanced totals with clear relative expression structure):\n  - $X^{(3)}$ has $g=3$ and $s=6$ with columns:\n    - Sample $1$: $\\begin{bmatrix} 100 \\\\ 50 \\\\ 10 \\end{bmatrix}$,\n    - Sample $2$: $\\begin{bmatrix} 96 \\\\ 48 \\\\ 16 \\end{bmatrix}$,\n    - Sample $3$: $\\begin{bmatrix} 104 \\\\ 52 \\\\ 4 \\end{bmatrix}$,\n    - Sample $4$: $\\begin{bmatrix} 10 \\\\ 50 \\\\ 100 \\end{bmatrix}$,\n    - Sample $5$: $\\begin{bmatrix} 16 \\\\ 48 \\\\ 96 \\end{bmatrix}$,\n    - Sample $6$: $\\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\\\ 52 \\\\ 104 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n  - Hence $X^{(3)} = \\begin{bmatrix} 100 & 96 & 104 & 10 & 16 & 4 \\\\ 50 & 48 & 52 & 50 & 48 & 52 \\\\ 10 & 16 & 4 & 100 & 96 & 104 \\end{bmatrix}$, and $k=2$.\n\nRequired program output:\n\n- Your program must produce a single line containing a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets.

All definitions, algorithms, and parameters are specified unambiguously. The problem is scientifically grounded, objective, and well-posed. Therefore, I will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe task is to take a raw gene expression count matrix $X$, compute a normalized and transformed matrix $Y$, cluster the samples (columns) of both $X$ and $Y$ using two different methods ($k$-means and hierarchical clustering), and then quantify the similarity between the raw-data clustering and the transformed-data clustering using the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI). This process must be repeated for three distinct test cases.\n\nFirst, let us formalize the data transformation. Given a raw count matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}^{g \\times s}$, where $g$ is the number of genes and $s$ is the number of samples, the transformation to matrix $Y$ involves two steps:\n1.  **Counts Per Million (CPM) Normalization**: This step corrects for differences in sequencing depth (library size) between samples. The library size for sample $j$ is $L_j = \\sum_{i=1}^{g} X_{ij}$. The CPM matrix $C$ is calculated as $C_{ij} = 10^6 \\cdot X_{ij} / L_j$ for $L_j > 0$, and $C_{ij} = 0$ if $L_j=0$. This rescales the counts in each sample to a common total of $10^6$.\n2.  **Logarithmic Transformation**: To stabilize variance and make the data more symmetric, a $\\log_2$ transform is applied. A pseudocount of $1$ is added to avoid taking the logarithm of zero. The final matrix is $Y_{ij} = \\log_2(C_{ij} + 1)$.\n\nNext, we must implement the two specified clustering algorithms for the samples, which are represented by the column vectors of the matrices $X$ and $Y$.\n\n**$k$-means Clustering**:\nThis is an iterative partitioning method. For a set of $s$ sample vectors in a $g$-dimensional space, the algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1.  **Initialization**: The first $k$ samples are chosen as the initial $k$ centroids.\n2.  **Assignment Step**: Each sample is assigned to the cluster whose centroid is closest, based on the Euclidean distance $d(\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v}) = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{g}(u_i-v_i)^2}$. In case of a tie in distances, the sample is assigned to the cluster with the smallest numerical index.\n3.  **Update Step**: The centroid of each cluster is recalculated as the mean of all sample vectors assigned to it.\n4.  **Empty Cluster Handling**: If an update step results in a cluster with no assigned samples, its centroid is re-initialized. The new centroid is chosen to be the sample vector that has the largest minimum Euclidean distance to any of the currently existing (non-empty) centroids. This helps to place the new centroid in a sparse region of the data space.\n5.  **Termination**: Steps $2-4$ are repeated until the cluster assignments no longer change between iterations, or a maximum of $100$ iterations is reached.\n\n**Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering**:\nThis is a bottom-up method that builds a hierarchy of clusters.\n1.  **Initialization**: Each sample starts in its own cluster.\n2.  **Iteration**: In each step, the two closest clusters are merged into a new, larger cluster. This process continues until only one cluster (containing all samples) remains. The distance between two clusters is defined by a linkage criterion. The problem specifies **average linkage** (also known as UPGMA), where the distance between two clusters is the average of the Euclidean distances between all pairs of samples, one from each cluster.\n3.  **Flat Cluster Extraction**: To obtain exactly $k$ clusters, the process of merging is stopped after $s-k$ merges have been performed. This is equivalent to cutting the resulting dendrogram at a level that yields $k$ distinct branches.\n\nFinally, for each clustering method, we must compare the partition obtained from the raw matrix $X$ (let's call it $\\mathcal{U}$) with the partition from the transformed matrix $Y$ (let's call it $\\mathcal{V}$). The comparison metric is the **Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)**. The ARI measures the similarity between two data clusterings, correcting for chance. Its value ranges from $-1$ to $1$, where $1$ indicates perfect agreement, values near $0$ indicate a random agreement, and negative values indicate less agreement than expected by chance.\nThe formula provided is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ARI}(\\mathcal{U},\\mathcal{V}) = \\frac{\\sum_{i,j} \\binom{n_{ij}}{2} - \\left[\\sum_{i} \\binom{a_i}{2} \\sum_{j} \\binom{b_j}{2}\\right] \\Big/ \\binom{s}{2}}{\\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\sum_{i} \\binom{a_i}{2} + \\sum_{j} \\binom{b_j}{2}\\right] - \\left[\\sum_{i} \\binom{a_i}{2} \\sum_{j} \\binom{b_j}{2}\\right] \\Big/ \\binom{s}{2}}\n$$\nwhere $n_{ij}$ is the number of samples in cluster $i$ of $\\mathcal{U}$ and cluster $j$ of $\\mathcal{V}$, $a_i$ is the total size of cluster $i$ in $\\mathcal{U}$, $b_j$ is the total size of cluster $j$ in $\\mathcal{V}$, and $s$ is the total number of samples. The term $\\binom{n}{2}$ counts the number of pairs of elements. A special condition is given for a zero denominator: $\\mathrm{ARI}=1$ for identical partitions and $0$ otherwise.\n\nThe implementation will process each test case by applying these steps, calculating the two required ARI values (one for $k$-means, one for hierarchical), and collating them into a single output list.

However, the provided test cases utilize $k \\in \\{0, 9, 17\\}$, all of which are well-defined. Additionally, the parameter constraint $a0b$ is not met by Case 1 where $(a,b)=(0,0)$. This is deemed a non-issue as for $k=0$, the parameters $a$ and $b$ are not used in the construction of the point set $S$. The problem is therefore tractable for the specified test cases.\n\nThe task is to perform agglomerative hierarchical clustering on three defined point sets using two different linkage criteria, single and complete, and to evaluate the results. For each case, we must compute the purity of the two-cluster partition ($P$) and the threshold $t_{\\min,2}$ at which this partition is formed ($T$).\n\nThe core of the solution is the implementation of agglomerative hierarchical clustering. Starting with $N$ singleton clusters, one for each point in $S$, the algorithm iteratively merges the two closest clusters until only one remains. The distance between clusters is defined by the chosen linkage method. The sequence of distances at which merges occur forms a non-decreasing list of heights, $h_1 \\le h_2 \\le \\dots \\le h_{N-1}$.\n\nThe two-cluster labeling is the state of the system when exactly two clusters remain. This state is achieved after $N-2$ merges. The threshold $t_{\\min,2}$ is defined as $h_{N-2}$, which is the height of the $(N-2)$-th merge—the merge that reduces the number of clusters from three to two.\n\nThe purity of a partition $\\{C_1, C_2\\}$ is calculated with respect to a ground-truth labeling $g$, where $g((x,y))=0$ if $x0$ and $g((x,y))=1$ if $x\\ge 0$. The purity is the fraction of points that are correctly classified if each cluster is assigned the label of the majority of its members.\n\nBelow is a theoretical analysis for each test case.\n\n**Case 1: $(L,m,\\Delta_y,a,b,k) = (10, 5, 3.1, 0, 0, 0)$**\nThe dataset $S$ consists of two groups of $m=5$ points, $S_L$ at $x=-10$ and $S_R$ at $x=10$. The bridge set $S_B$ is empty ($k=0$). Total points $N=10$.\n- Intra-group distances: Within $S_L$ or $S_R$, the minimum distance between points is $\\Delta_y=3.1$. The maximum distance is $4\\Delta_y=12.4$.\n- Inter-group distance: The minimum distance between any point in $S_L$ and any point in $S_R$ is $d((-10,0), (10,0)) = 20$.\n- Ground truth partition is $\\{S_L, S_R\\}$, which is perfectly separated.\n\n_Single Linkage_:\nThe smallest distances in the dataset are all intra-group, equal to $\\Delta_y=3.1$. Agglomeration will first form clusters within $S_L$ and $S_R$. Single linkage exhibits a chaining behavior; all points in $S_L$ will form one cluster, and all in $S_R$ another, through a series of merges at height $3.1$. After $2 \\times (m-1) = 8$ merges, two clusters, $S_L$ and $S_R$, will remain. Thus, the two-cluster partition is $\\{S_L, S_R\\}$, yielding a perfect purity $P_{\\text{single}}=1.0$. The $(N-2)$-th merge is the 8th merge. Since all of the first 8 merges occur at height $3.1$, $T_{\\text{single}} = h_8 = 3.1$.\n\n_Complete Linkage_:\nThis linkage is sensitive to cluster diameter. The maximum distance within $S_L$ (its diameter) is $4\\Delta_y=12.4$, which is less than the minimum distance between $S_L$ and $S_R$ ($20$). Therefore, as with single linkage, all intra-group merges will occur before any inter-group merges. The two-cluster partition is again $\\{S_L, S_R\\}$, with $P_{\\text{complete}}=1.0$. The threshold $T_{\\text{complete}}=h_8$ is the height of the 8th merge overall. The final merge to form the complete $S_L$ cluster (and similarly for $S_R$) will involve joining two subsets of $S_L$. The height of this merge can be as large as the diameter, $12.4$. The two largest merge heights among the first 8 merges will be the heights of the final merges forming $S_L$ and $S_R$. Thus, $h_7$ and $h_8$ will both be $12.4$. So, $T_{\\text{complete}}=12.4$.\n\n**Case 2: $(L,m,\\Delta_y,a,b,k) = (10, 5, 3.1, -4.8, 5.2, 9)$**\nHere, a bridge of $k=9$ points connects the two groups. $N=19$.\n- The points in $S_B$ are spaced by $1.25$ on the x-axis, from $x=-4.8$ to $x=5.2$.\n- The minimum distance between $S_L$ and $S_B$ is $d((-10,0),(-4.8,0)) = 5.2$.\n- The minimum distance between $S_R$ and $S_B$ is $d((10,0),(5.2,0)) = 4.8$.\n- The hierarchy of minimum distances is: $1.25$ (intra-$S_B$) $ 3.1$ (intra-$S_L,S_R$) $ 4.8$ ($S_R-S_B$) $ 5.2$ ($S_L-S_B$).\n\n_Single Linkage_:\nDue to chaining, all points in $S_B$ will first merge into a single cluster $C_B$ at height $1.25$. Then, intra-group merges will occur in $S_L$ and $S_R$ at height $3.1$. This will result in three clusters: $S_L, S_R, C_B$. The next merge will be between the closest pair of these three, which is $S_R$ and $C_B$ at distance $4.8$. This leaves two clusters: $\\{S_L, S_R \\cup C_B\\}$. This is the two-cluster partition. The merge occurred at height $h_{17} = 4.8$, so $T_{\\text{single}}=4.8$. The purity is calculated for this partition: $C_1=S_L$ contains $5$ points with $g=0$. $C_2=S_R \\cup S_B$ contains $4$ points from $S_B$ with $g=0$ and $5+5=10$ points with $g=1$. Purity is $(5 + \\max(4,10))/19 = 15/19 \\approx 0.7895$.\n\n_Complete Linkage_:\nThis linkage favors compact clusters and is resistant to chaining. It is expected to partition the data according to the ground truth, grouping $S_L$ with the nearby negative-x bridge points ($C_0$), and $S_R$ with the positive-x bridge points ($C_1$). This partition gives $P_{\\text{complete}}=1.0$. The threshold $T_{\\text{complete}}=h_{17}$ is the height of the last merge that occurs *within* either $C_0$ or $C_1$. This is determined by the \"bottleneck\" partition of either cluster. The final merge height to form $C_1 = S_R \\cup \\{p\\in S_B|g(p)=1\\}$ is limited by its diameter, specifically $d((10, 6.2), (0.2, 0)) \\approx 11.5966$. The corresponding value for $C_0$ is smaller. Thus, $T_{\\text{complete}} \\approx 11.5966$.\n\n**Case 3: $(L,m,\\Delta_y,a,b,k) = (10, 5, 3.1, -6.7, 7.1, 17)$**\nThe bridge is now denser ($k=17$) and closer to the side groups. $N=27$.\n- Points in $S_B$ are spaced by $0.8625$, from $x=-6.7$ to $x=7.1$.\n- Minimum distances: $0.8625$ (intra-$S_B$) $ 2.9$ ($S_R-S_B$) $ 3.1$ (intra-$S_L,S_R$) $ 3.3$ ($S_L-S_B$).\n\n_Single Linkage_:\nThe logic is analogous to Case 2. The closer proximity of the bridge will again cause chaining. The hierarchy of distances dictates a specific merge order: $S_B$ forms a cluster, then merges with $S_R$ (at height $2.9$), then absorbs it (at height $3.1$). In parallel, $S_L$ forms. The two resulting clusters are $S_L$ and $S_R \\cup S_B$. This partition is formed when all merges up to height $3.1$ are complete. The merge that joins these two final clusters occurs at height $3.3$. Thus, $T_{\\text{single}} = h_{25}$ is the height of the last merge needed to form the two groups, which is $3.1$. For the partition $\\{S_L, S_R \\cup S_B\\}$, $C_1=S_L$ has $5$ points with $g=0$. $C_2=S_R \\cup S_B$ has $8$ points with $g=0$ and $5+9=14$ points with $g=1$. Purity is $(5 + 14)/27 = 19/27 \\approx 0.7037$.\n\n_Complete Linkage_:\nSimilar to Case 2, complete linkage will produce the ground-truth partition $\\{C_0, C_1\\}$, giving $P_{\\text{complete}}=1.0$. The threshold $T_{\\text{complete}}=h_{25}$ is determined by the larger of the final merge heights forming $C_0$ and $C_1$. The geometry for cluster $C_1$ is determined by $S_R$ and the positive bridge point closest to the origin, which is $x=0.2$ (same as in Case 2). Thus, the calculation for its bottleneck merge height is identical, yielding $T_{\\text{complete}} \\approx 11.5966$. The corresponding height for $C_0$ is slightly larger than in Case 2 but still smaller than for $C_1$. Therefore, $T_{\\text{complete}}$ remains the same.\n\nThe following program implements this logic to compute the required values.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef construct_point_set(L, m, delta_y, a, b, k):\n    \"\"\"Constructs the point set S and ground truth labels.\"\"\"\n    # S_L: Left set\n    j_indices = np.arange(-(m -

The merge height is defined as $h(A^\\star,B^\\star) = \\delta(A^\\star,B^\\star)$.

The program should produce a single line of output containing the results for all test cases as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, for example:\n$[ \\text{result\\_for\\_}t_1, \\text{result\\_for\\_}t_2, \\text{result\\_for\\_}t_3 ]$.\n\nYour implementation must be deterministic under the provided tie-breaking conventions and must not require any external input.\n\nThe test suite is designed to cover: a boundary condition with $k = n$ when $t = t_1$ (no merges), a typical case with intermediate $k$ when $t = t_2$, and a boundary condition with $k = 1$ when $t = t_3$.", "solution": "The problem requires the implementation of a deterministic two-phase clustering analysis on a given gene expression matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{8 \\times 3}$. The first phase involves agglomerative hierarchical clustering to generate an initial partitioning of the data. The second phase refines this partition using an iterative k-means-like algorithm to obtain a self-consistent result. The entire procedure is rendered deterministic by explicit tie-breaking rules at each stage.\n\nFirst, we must construct the complete agglomerative hierarchy for the $n=8$ genes. The process starts with each gene as a singleton cluster, i.e., $\\mathcal{C}^{(0)} = \\{\\{0\\}, \\{1\\}, \\ldots, \\{7\\}\\}$. At each subsequent step, we merge the two clusters $A,B \\in \\mathcal{C}$ that exhibit the minimum average-linkage dissimilarity, defined as:\n$$\n\\delta(A,B) = \\frac{1}{|A|\\,|B|} \\sum_{i \\in A}\\sum_{j \\in B} d(x_i,x_j)\n$$\nwhere $d(x_i, x_j) = \\lVert x_i - x_j \\rVert_2$ is the Euclidean distance between the expression profiles of gene $i$ and gene $j$. A critical aspect of this step is the tie-breaking rule: if multiple pairs of clusters yield the same minimal dissimilarity $\\delta$, the pair $\\{A, B\\}$ (with $\\min A  \\min B$) is chosen such that the ordered pair $(\\min A, \\min B)$ is lexicographically smallest. This rule ensures that the resulting hierarchy, represented by a dendrogram with merge heights $h(A, B) = \\delta(A, B)$, is unique. This procedure is performed for $n-1=7$ steps until all genes belong to a single cluster. The full sequence of merges and their corresponding heights must be stored.\n\nNext, for each given threshold $t \\in \\{0.01, 5.0, 1000.0\\}$, we derive an initial partition $\\mathcal{P}_t$. This partition is obtained by executing all merges from the hierarchy whose height $h$ is less than or equal to the threshold $t$. The resulting partition $\\mathcal{P}_t = \\{C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_k\\}$ consists of $k$ disjoint clusters. For canonical representation, these clusters are ordered such that their minimum gene indices are strictly increasing: $\\min C_1  \\min C_2  \\cdots  \\min C_k$. The number of clusters $k = |\\mathcal{P}_t|$ is determined by the threshold $t$.\n\nThe third stage is an iterative refinement process, analogous to the k-means algorithm, aimed at achieving a self-consistent state. The process is initialized using the partition $\\mathcal{P}_t$. Specifically, the number of clusters is $k$, and the initial centroids are the means of the clusters in $\\mathcal{P}_t$:\n$$\n\\mu_\\ell^{(0)} = \\frac{1}{|C_\\ell|} \\sum_{i \\in C_\\ell} x_i \\quad \\text{for } \\ell = 1, \\ldots, k.\n$$\nThe iterative procedure then alternates between two steps:\n1.  **Assignment Step**: Each gene $i$ is assigned to the cluster $\\ell$ whose centroid $\\mu_\\ell^{(r)}$ is closest to $x_i$. That is, we find $\\ell^\\star = \\arg\\min_{\\ell \\in \\{1,\\ldots,k\\}} \\lVert x_i - \\mu_\\ell^{(r)} \\rVert_2$. Again, a tie-breaking rule is specified: if multiple centroids are equidistant, the gene is assigned to the cluster with the smallest index $\\ell$. This step produces a new partition $\\mathcal{A}^{(r+1)}$.\n2.  **Update Step**: The centroids are recalculated based on the new assignments. For each cluster $A_\\ell^{(r+1)}$, the new centroid is its mean: $\\mu_\\ell^{(r+1)} = \\frac{1}{|A_\\ell^{(r+1)}|} \\sum_{i \\in A_\\ell^{(r+1)}} x_i$. If any cluster $A_\\ell^{(r+1)}$ becomes empty, its centroid is not updated; i.e., $\\mu_\\ell^{(r+1)} = \\mu_\\ell^{(r)}$.\n\nThis process continues until the cluster assignments do not change from one iteration to the next ($\\mathcal{A}^{(r+1)} = \\mathcal{A}^{(r)}$), or for a maximum of $1000$ iterations. Let the final, self-consistent partition be $\\mathcal{A}^\\star$ and the final centroids be $\\{\\mu_\\ell^\\star\\}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) for the resulting configuration:\n$$\nW^\\star = W(\\mathcal{A}^\\star, \\{\\mu_\\ell^\\star\\}) = \\sum_{\\ell=1}^k \\sum_{i \\in A_\\ell^\\star} \\lVert x_i - \\mu_\\ell^\\star \\rVert_2^2.\n$$\nFor each test threshold $t$, the results—$k$, $W^\\star$, the list of final cluster assignments for each gene, and the list of final centroids—are collected. All real-valued outputs are rounded to $6$ decimal places and formatted into a single line as specified. The implementation must meticulously follow all definitions and tie-breaking rules to ensure a correct and deterministic outcome.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the clustering problem for the given test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    X = np.array([\n        [10.0, 11.2, 9.5],\n        [9.5, 10.8, 9.7],\n        [10.8, 11.0, 10.2],\n        [49.5, 50.1, 51.2],\n        [51.2, 49.7, 50.4],\n        [49.9, 51.0, 49.8],\n        [100.2, 98.9, 101.5],\n        [101.1, 100.3, 98.8]\n    ])\n\n    ts = [0.01, 5.0, 1000.0]\n\n    # Perform hierarchical clustering once.\n    hc = HierarchicalClustering(X)\n    linkage_matrix = hc.get_linkage_matrix()\n\n    all_results = []\n    for t in ts:\n        result = solve_for_t(X, t, linkage_matrix)\n        all_results.append(result)\n\n    # Format output\n    results_strs = [format_result(r) for r in all_results]\n    print(f\"[{','.join(results_strs)}]\")\n\nclass HierarchicalClustering:\n    \"\"\"\n    Implements agglomerative hierarchical clustering with average linkage and\n    a specific tie-breaking rule.\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, X):\n        self.X = X\n        self.n = X.shape[0]\n        self.dist_matrix = self._compute_pairwise_distances()\n        self.linkage_matrix = self._build_linkage()\n\n    def get_linkage_matrix(self):\n        return self.linkage_matrix\n\n    def _compute_pairwise_distances(self):\n        dists = np.zeros((self.n, self.n))\n        for i in range(self.n):\n            for j in range(i + 1, self.n):\n                d = np.linalg.norm(self.X[i] - self.X[j])\n                dists[i, j] = dists[j, i] = d\n        return dists\n\n    def _get_cluster_dist(self, c1_indices, c2_indices):\n        total_dist = np.sum(self.dist_matrix[np.ix_(list(c1_indices), list(c2_indices))])\n        return total_dist / (len(c1_indices) * len(c2_indices))\n\n    def _build_linkage(self):\n        active_clusters = {i: {i} for i in range(self.n)}\n        linkage = []\n        next_cluster_id = self.n\n\n        for _ in range(self.n - 1):\n            best_pair_info = (sys.float_info.max,)\n\n            active_ids = sorted(list(active_clusters.keys()))\n            for i in range(len(active_ids)):\n                for j in range(i + 1, len(active_ids)):\n                    id1, id2 = active_ids[i], active_ids[j]\n                    c1, c2 = active_clusters[id1], active_clusters[id2]\n                    dist = self._get_cluster_dist(c1, c2)\n\n                    m1, m2 = min(c1), min(c2)\n                    if m1 > m2:\n                        m1, m2 = m2, m1\n                    \n                    current_pair_info = (dist, m1, m2, id1, id2)\n\n                    if current_pair_info  best_pair_info:\n                        best_pair_info = current_pair_info\n            \n            dist, _, _, id1, id2 = best_pair_info\n            id1, id2 = sorted((id1, id2))\n\n            c1 = active_clusters.pop(id1)\n            c2 = active_clusters.pop(id2)\n            \n            new_cluster = c1.union(c2)\n            linkage.append([float(id1), float(id2), dist, float(len(new_cluster))])\n            \n            active_clusters[next_cluster_id] = new_cluster\n            next_cluster_id += 1\n            \n        return np.array(linkage)\n\ndef solve_for_t(X, t, linkage_matrix):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem for a single threshold t.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = X.shape[0]\n    \n    # 1.
