The filter must detect and mark single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in control samples that show a statistically significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). A SNP is biallelic with alleles denoted by $A$ and $a$. For each SNP, you are provided the genotype counts in controls: $n_{AA}$ for homozygous $AA$, $n_{Aa}$ for heterozygous $Aa$, and $n_{aa}$ for homozygous $aa$. Let $n = n_{AA} + n_{Aa} + n_{aa}$ denote the number of control individuals.\n\nUnder the null hypothesis of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), the population is assumed to arise from random mating given the underlying allele frequencies.

This structure allows for a unique, computable solution for each test case.\n- **Objective**: The problem is valid. It is formulated using objective, technical language devoid of subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is **valid**. A solution will be constructed.\n\n---\n\nThe problem requires the implementation of an exact test for Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE). This test is a standard procedure for quality control in genetic studies, as significant deviations from HWE can indicate genotyping errors. The solution involves calculating a two-sided $p$-value for a given set of observed genotype counts and comparing it to a significance level $\\alpha$.\n\nLet the observed genotype counts for a biallelic SNP be $n_{AA}$, $n_{Aa}$, and $n_{aa}$. The total number of individuals in the sample is $n = n_{AA} + n_{Aa} + n_{aa}$. The counts of the two alleles, which we denote as $A$ and $a$, are:\n- Number of $A$ alleles: $N_A = 2n_{AA} + n_{Aa}$\n- Number of $a$ alleles: $N_a = 2n_{aa} + n_{Aa}$\nThe total number of alleles in the sample is $2n = N_A + N_a$.\n\nThe exact test for HWE is conditional on the observed allele counts, $N_A$ and $N_a$. Under the null hypothesis of HWE, we can conceptualize the $2n$ alleles in the sample as being randomly paired to form $n$ diploid individuals. Keeping the allele counts $N_A$ and $N_a$ fixed restricts the possible genotype configurations. Specifically, if we know the number of heterozygotes, $n_{Aa}$, the counts of homozygotes are determined:\n$$ n_{AA} = \\frac{N_A - n_{Aa}}{2} $$\n$$ n_{aa} = \\frac{N_a - n_{Aa}}{2} $$\nSince $n_{AA}$ and $n_{aa}$ must be non-negative integers, the number of heterozygotes, $n_{Aa}$, uniquely defines the genotype counts for a fixed $N_A$ and $N_a$. The probability of observing a specific count of heterozygotes, $k$, given the allele counts, follows a specific probability distribution derived from combinatorial arguments. The probability mass function (PMF) is:\n$$ P(n_{Aa} = k | n, N_A, N_a) = \\frac{n! N_A! N_a! 2^k}{(2n)! n_{AA_k}! k! n_{aa_k}!} $$\nwhere $n_{AA_k} = (N_A - k)/2$ and $n_{aa_k} = (N_a - k)/2$.\n\nThe range of possible values for $k$ (the support of the distribution) is determined by the constraints that genotype counts must be non-negative integers.\n1.  $k \\geq 0$\n2.  $n_{AA_k} \\geq 0 \\implies k \\leq N_A$\n3.  $n_{aa_k} \\geq 0 \\implies k \\leq N_a$\n4.  Furthermore, for $n_{AA_k}$ and $n_{aa_k}$ to be integers, $(N_A - k)$ and $(N_a - k)$ must be even. This implies that $k$ must have the same parity (even or odd) as $N_A$ and $N_a$. Note that $N_A$ and $N_a$ always have the same parity because their sum, $2n$, is even.\n\nThe two-sided $p$-value is defined as the sum of probabilities of all possible configurations that are as probable or less probable than the observed configuration. Let the observed heterozygote count be $n_{Aa,obs}$. The probability of this observation is $P_{obs} = P(n_{Aa} = n_{Aa,obs})$. The $p$-value is then:\n$$ p = \\sum_{k \\in \\text{support}} P(n_{Aa} = k) \\quad \\text{such that} \\quad P(n_{Aa} = k) \\leq P_{obs} $$\n\nThe calculation involves factorials of large numbers, which can lead to numerical overflow or underflow. To maintain precision, computations should be performed in log-space. The logarithm of the PMF is:\n$$ \\ln P(k) = \\ln(n!) + \\ln(N_A!) + \\ln(N_a!) + k\\ln(2) - \\ln((2n)!) - \\ln(n_{AA_k}!) - \\ln(k!) - \\ln(n_{aa_k}!) $$\nThe log-factorial, $\\ln(x!)$, can be computed using the log-gamma function, `gammaln`, as $\\ln(x!) = \\text{gammaln}(x+1)$.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows for each test case:\n1.  Calculate $n, N_A, N_a$ from the input genotype counts $n_{AA,obs}, n_{Aa,obs}, n_{aa,obs}$.\n2.  Handle the trivial case where the SNP is monomorphic (i.e., $N_A=0$ or $N_a=0$). In this situation, only one genotype configuration is possible, its probability is $1$, and thus the $p$-value is $1$.\n3.  Determine the support for $n_{Aa}$: iterate from the minimum possible value (0 or 1, depending on parity) to the maximum possible value, $\\min(N_A, N_a)$, with a step of $2$.\n4.  Calculate the log-probability of the observed configuration, $\\ln(P_{obs})$.\n5.  Initialize the $p$-value to $0$. Iterate through all possible values $k$ in the support. For each $k$, calculate its log-probability, $\\ln(P_k)$.\n6.  If $\\ln(P_k) \\leq \\ln(P_{obs})$, add the probability $P_k = \\exp(\\ln(P_k))$ to the total $p$-value.\n7.  Finally, compare the calculated $p$-value with the given significance level $\\alpha$. If $p < \\alpha$, the result is $1$ (remove). Otherwise, the result is $0$ (keep).\n\nThis procedure is implemented for each of the specified test cases to produce the final output.", "answer": "[0,0,0,0,1,0]", "id": "2394652"}, {"introduction": "Even with robust statistical thresholds and clean data, systematic biases can still lead to widespread spurious findings in a GWAS.

The calculation requires three components: the median of the observed $\\chi^{2}$ statistics for each scenario and the theoretical median of a $\\chi^{2}$ distribution with $1$ degree of freedom.\n\nFirst, we determine the theoretical median, $\\operatorname{median}\\!\\left(\\chi^{2}_{1,\\text{null}}\\right)$. A random variable $X$ that follows a chi-square distribution with one degree of freedom ($X \\sim \\chi^{2}_{1}$) can be represented as the square of a standard normal random variable, $X = Z^2$, where $Z \\sim N(0,1)$. The median of $X$ is the value $m$ such that $P(X \\le m) = 0.5$. This is equivalent to $P(Z^2 \\le m) = 0.5$, which simplifies to $P(-\\sqrt{m} \\le Z \\le \\sqrt{m}) = 0.5$.\n\nLet $\\Phi(z)$ be the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution. Then, $P(-\\sqrt{m} \\le Z \\le \\sqrt{m}) = \\Phi(\\sqrt{m}) - \\Phi(-\\sqrt{m})$. Due to the symmetry of the normal distribution, $\\Phi(-z) = 1 - \\Phi(z)$, so the expression becomes $2\\Phi(\\sqrt{m}) - 1$.\nWe set this equal to $0.5$:\n$$2\\Phi(\\sqrt{m}) - 1 = 0.5$$\n$$\\Phi(\\sqrt{m}) = \\frac{1.5}{2} = 0.75$$\nTherefore, $\\sqrt{m}$ is the $0.75$-quantile of the standard normal distribution, often denoted $z_{0.75}$. The median $m$ is the square of this quantile.\n$$m = \\left(z_{0.75}\\right)^2$$\nThe value of $z_{0.75}$ is a standard statistical constant, approximately $0.67449$.\n$$\\operatorname{median}\\!\\left(\\chi^{2}_{1,\\text{null}}\\right) = (0.67449)^2 \\approx 0.454936$$\n\nNext, we compute the median of the observed $\\chi^{2}$ statistics for each scenario. For both scenarios, the number of observations is $n = 21$, which is an odd number. For a sorted dataset of size $n$, the median is the value at position $\\frac{n+1}{2}$.\nFor $n = 21$, the median is the value at position $\\frac{21+1}{2} = 11$.\n\nFor the **null scenario**, the provided list of statistics is already sorted in ascending order.
