The goal is to force the cell's splicing machinery to skip an entire exon, thereby producing a shorter messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and a truncated protein. In eukaryotic gene expression, splicing removes introns based on recognition of specific sequences at intron-exon boundaries. The 3' splice site (acceptor site), which marks the end of an intron, typically contains a polypyrimidine tract followed by a nearly invariant `AG` dinucleotide just before the exon begins.\n\nThe pre-mRNA sequence for `syn-2` at the boundary of Intron 1 and Exon 2 is shown below.

In eukaryotic pre-mRNA splicing, the 3' acceptor site consists of a polypyrimidine tract followed immediately by a nearly invariant dinucleotide $AG$ at the last two nucleotides of the intron, positioned at $-2$ and $-1$ relative to the exon start.

Among the options:\n\n- U5C: converts a pyrimidine to another pyrimidine within the polypyrimidine tract; minimal effect.\n- A7G: changes a purine to purine in the tract; does not eliminate the critical $AG$ and is less disruptive than mutating the invariant dinucleotide.\n- G10A: converts the invariant $AG$ to $AA$ at positions 9–10, abolishing the essential $AG$ recognized by the spliceosome (including U2AF35), which is most likely to block usage of this acceptor.\n- G11C: alters the first nucleotide of the exon ($+1$ position). While $G$ at $+1$ is common, it is not invariant; the upstream $AG$ remains intact, so the site is still likely to be used.\n- C4G: introduces a purine into the polypyrimidine tract, weakening it but not as severely as destroying the invariant $AG$.\n\nTherefore, the mutation G10A (option C) most directly abolishes the invariant $AG$ at the 3' splice acceptor site and is most likely to force exon skipping by redirecting the spliceosome to the next downstream acceptor.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2036728"}, {"introduction": "The regulation of gene expression extends beyond simple transcription.
