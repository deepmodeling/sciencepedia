It is scientifically grounded in the principles of chemical equilibrium and biophysical thermodynamics. The provided data ($K_d$, $C_T$) are physically realistic for protein interactions. The problem is well-posed, containing all necessary information for the calculation and a clear, objective directive for the qualitative explanation. It is directly relevant to the topic of protein quaternary structure. It contains no logical contradictions, ambiguities, or pseudoscientific elements. Therefore, I will proceed with the solution.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the Dimeric Fraction**\n\nThe state of the system at equilibrium is governed by two fundamental principles: the law of mass action and the conservation of mass.\n\n1.  **Law of Mass Action:** For the dissociation reaction $A_2 \\rightleftharpoons A + A$, the dissociation constant, $K_{d}$, is defined by the ratio of the equilibrium concentrations of the products to the reactant:\n    $$K_{d} = \\frac{[A]^{2}}{[A_{2}]}$$\n    where $[A]$ is the equilibrium concentration of the free monomer and $[A_{2}]$ is the equilibrium concentration of the dimer.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Mass:** The total concentration of subunits, $C_{T}$, must remain constant. Each dimer contains two subunits, so the total subunit concentration is the sum of the concentration of free monomers and twice the concentration of dimers:\n    $$C_{T} = [A] + 2[A_{2}]$$\n\nWe have a system of two equations with two unknowns, $[A]$ and $[A_{2}]$. Our objective is to solve for $[A_{2}]$ to then calculate the fraction $f$. We can express $[A]$ in terms of $[A_{2}]$ using the mass conservation equation:\n$$[A] = C_{T} - 2[A_{2}]$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $[A]$ into the law of mass action equation yields:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{(C_{T} - 2[A_{2}])^{2}}{[A_{2}]}$$\n\nThis equation can be rearranged into a standard quadratic form, $ax^{2} + bx + c = 0$, where the variable $x$ is the dimer concentration $[A_{2}]$:\n$$K_{d}[A_{2}] = (C_{T} - 2[A_{2}])^{2} = C_{T}^{2} - 4C_{T}[A_{2}] + 4[A_{2}]^{2}$$\n$$4[A_{2}]^{2} - (4C_{T} + K_{d})[A_{2}] + C_{T}^{2} = 0$$\n\nWe solve for $[A_{2}]$ using the quadratic formula, $[A_{2}] = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with coefficients $a=4$, $b=-(4C_{T} + K_{d})$, and $c=C_{T}^{2}$.\n$$[A_{2}] = \\frac{(4C_{T} + K_{d}) \\pm \\sqrt{(-(4C_{T} + K_{d}))^{2} - 4(4)(C_{T}^{2})}}{2(4)}$$\n$$[A_{2}] = \\frac{(4C_{T} + K_{d}) \\pm \\sqrt{(4C_{T} + K_{d})^{2} - 16C_{T}^{2}}}{8}$$\nExpanding the term under the square root:\n$$(4C_{T} + K_{d})^{2} - 16C_{T}^{2} = (16C_{T}^{2} + 8C_{T}K_{d} + K_{d}^{2}) - 16C_{T}^{2} = 8C_{T}K_{d} + K_{d}^{2}$$\nThus, the solution simplifies to:\n$$[A_{2}] = \\frac{(4C_{T} + K_{d}) \\pm \\sqrt{8C_{T}K_{d} + K_{d}^{2}}}{8}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values: $C_{T} = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and $K_{d} = 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n$$[A_{2}] = \\frac{(4(10) + 1) \\pm \\sqrt{8(10)(1) + (1)^{2}}}{8} \\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\n$$[A_{2}] = \\frac{41 \\pm \\sqrt{80 + 1}}{8} \\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\n$$[A_{2}] = \\frac{41 \\pm \\sqrt{81}}{8} \\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\n$$[A_{2}] = \\frac{41 \\pm 9}{8} \\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\n\nThis yields two possible mathematical solutions for $[A_{2}]$:\n$$[A_{2}]^{(1)} = \\frac{41 + 9}{8} = \\frac{50}{8} = 6.25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\n$$[A_{2}]^{(2)} = \\frac{41 - 9}{8} = \\frac{32}{8} = 4.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\n\nWe must select the physically valid solution. The total concentration of subunits tied up in dimers, $2[A_{2}]$, cannot exceed the total subunit concentration, $C_{T}$.\nFor the first root, $2[A_{2}]^{(1)} = 2(6.25) = 12.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. This value is greater than $C_{T} = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, violating the principle of mass conservation. This root is therefore physically invalid.\nFor the second root, $2[A_{2}]^{(2)} = 2(4.0) = 8.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. This value is less than or equal to $C_{T}$, so it is the physically correct solution.\nThus, the equilibrium concentration of the dimer is $[A_{2}] = 4.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the fraction of subunits present in the dimeric state, $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{2[A_{2}]}{C_{T}} = \\frac{2(4.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})}{10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}} = \\frac{8.0}{10} = 0.8$$\nThe problem requires the result as a pure decimal number rounded to four significant figures.\n$$f = 0.8000$$\n\n**Part 2: Correlation Between Interface Size and Binding Affinity**\n\nThe binding affinity of a protein-protein interaction is quantified by the standard Gibbs free energy of binding, $\\Delta G^\\circ_{binding}$. A more negative $\\Delta G^\\circ_{binding}$ corresponds to a higher affinity (stronger binding) and a smaller dissociation constant $K_{d}$, according to the relation $\\Delta G^\\circ_{binding} = RT \\ln K_{d}$. The Gibbs free energy is composed of enthalpic ($\\Delta H^\\circ_{binding}$) and entropic ($\\Delta S^\\circ_{binding}$) terms: $\\Delta G^\\circ_{binding} = \\Delta H^\\circ_{binding} - T\\Delta S^\\circ_{binding}$.\n\nThe correlation between the size of the buried protein-protein interface and binding affinity arises from how these thermodynamic components scale with the area of the surface that is removed from solvent exposure upon association.\n\n1.  **Enthalpic Contributions ($\\Delta H^\\circ_{binding}$)**: The formation of the dimer interface is typically enthalpically favorable (negative $\\Delta H^\\circ_{binding}$). This favorability stems primarily from the formation of non-covalent interactions.\n    - **Van der Waals Interactions**: The interface allows for close packing of atoms, leading to a large number of short-range, favorable van der Waals contacts. The total energy contributed by these interactions is directly proportional to the number of interacting atom pairs, which scales with the surface area of the interface. A larger interface permits more such contacts.\n    - **Hydrogen Bonds and Salt Bridges**: A larger interface also provides more opportunity to form a network of specific, directional interactions such as hydrogen bonds between polar groups and salt bridges between oppositely charged residues. The formation of these bonds is highly favorable enthalpically. A larger, well-complementary interface can accommodate more of these high-energy interactions.\n\n2.  **Entropic Contributions ($\\Delta S^\\circ_{binding}$)**: The entropic term is complex, with both unfavorable and favorable components.\n    - **Unfavorable Entropy**: The primary unfavorable contribution is the significant loss of translational and rotational entropy that occurs when two independently diffusing molecules form a single complex. This is a large entropic penalty that must be paid for any association reaction to occur. Additionally, the side chains and backbone segments at the interface may lose conformational flexibility as they become fixed in a bound state, representing a loss of conformational entropy. This unfavorable term also generally scales with the size of the interface.\n    - **Favorable Entropy (The Hydrophobic Effect)**: This is often the dominant driving force for protein association in aqueous solution. Nonpolar amino acid side chains are entropically costly to expose to water, as water molecules must form ordered, \"clathrate-like\" cages around them, decreasing the entropy of the solvent. When two protein monomers associate, they bury these nonpolar surfaces at the interface, releasing the ordered water molecules back into the bulk solvent. This release results in a large, favorable increase in the solvent's entropy. The magnitude of this favorable entropic change is directly proportional to the area of the nonpolar surface that is buried.\n\n**Synthesis and Correlation**:\nA larger buried interface area generally correlates with a stronger binding affinity (a more negative $\\Delta G^\\circ_{binding}$) because the favorable energetic contributions that scale with area tend to overwhelm the unfavorable ones.\nThe large, unfavorable loss of translational and rotational entropy is a constant cost of association, largely independent of interface size. To achieve a favorable overall $\\Delta G^\\circ_{binding}$, this cost must be offset by the favorable changes that occur at the interface.\nA larger interface allows for:\n- A greater number of favorable van der Waals contacts ($\\Delta H \\ll 0$).\n- More possibilities for forming hydrogen bonds and salt bridges ($\\Delta H \\ll 0$).\n- The burial of a more extensive nonpolar surface area, leading to a larger release of ordered water and thus a more favorable entropic gain from the hydrophobic effect ($\\Delta S \\gg 0$).\n\nConsequently, as the size of the complementary interface increases, the sum of the favorable enthalpic and entropic contributions becomes increasingly negative, more effectively overcoming the entropic penalty of association. This leads to a more negative $\\Delta G^\\circ_{binding}$ and therefore a stronger, more stable protein complex.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8000}$$", "id": "2960177"}, {"introduction": "In the era of large-scale structural biology, thousands of protein structures are available, but many contain molecular contacts that are merely artifacts of the crystallization process.

It is a clear, self-contained, and scientifically sound computational task. A solution will now be constructed.\n\nThe task is to implement a classification algorithm based on a weighted scoring function derived from geometric properties of a protein-protein interface. The objective is to distinguish between biologically obligate interfaces and incidental crystal packing contacts. The solution requires a direct translation of the provided mathematical model into a computational program.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds in three main stages:\n1.  **Feature Normalization**: Each of the six input geometric descriptors ($A$, $d_{\\mathrm{mean}}$, $d_{\\mathrm{std}}$, $c$, $\\rho$, $p_{\\mathrm{rms}}$) is converted into a normalized score, $s_i$, that falls within the interval $[0, 1]$. A score of $1$ represents the most favorable value for an obligate interface, while a score of $0$ represents the least favorable.\n    -   The area score, $s_A(A) = \\min(1, A / A_0)$, reflects that larger interfaces are more likely to be biological. The score increases linearly with area $A$ up to a saturation point at $A_0 = 12.0\\,\\mathrm{nm}^2$.\n    -   The gap score, $s_G(d_{\\mathrm{mean}}) = \\mathrm{clamp}_{[0,1]}(1 - \\frac{d_{\\mathrm{mean}} - d_{\\min}}{d_{\\max} - d_{\\min}})$, models interface tightness. It yields higher scores for smaller mean interatomic gaps, indicating better packing. The score is $1$ at $d_{\\mathrm{mean}} \\le d_{\\min} = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and decreases to $0$ at $d_{\\mathrm{mean}} \\ge d_{\\max} = 0.80\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n    -   The gap uniformity score, $s_V(d_{\\mathrm{std}}) = \\mathrm{clamp}_{[0,1]}(1 - d_{\\mathrm{std}} / d_{\\mathrm{std}}^{\\max})$, quantifies the consistency of packing. A smaller standard deviation $d_{\\mathrm{std}}$ signifies a more uniform interface, resulting in a higher score.\n    -   The circularity score, $s_C(c) = \\mathrm{clamp}_{[0,1]}(c)$, is based on the observation that biological interfaces tend to be more compact and less disk-like than crystal contacts. The score is simply the circularity value $c$ itself, clamped to the $[0, 1]$ interval.\n    -   The density score, $s_D(\\rho) = \\min(1, \\rho / \\rho_0)$, measures the number of atomic contacts per unit area. Higher density is characteristic of well-packed biological interfaces and thus receives a higher score, saturating at $\\rho_0 = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{contacts}/\\mathrm{nm}^2$.\n    -   The non-planarity score, $s_P(p_{\\mathrm{rms}}) = \\min(1, p_{\\mathrm{rms}} / p_0)$, captures the degree of surface complementarity. Biological interfaces often feature interdigitated side chains, leading to a less planar surface. A larger deviation from planarity $p_{\\mathrm{rms}}$ results in a higher score, saturating at $p_0 = 0.15\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n\n2.  **Overall Score Calculation**: The individual scores are combined into a single overall score, $S$, using a weighted sum:\n    $$ S = w_A s_A + w_G s_G + w_V s_V + w_C s_C + w_D s_D + w_P s_P $$\n    The weights ($w_A = 0.25$, $w_G = 0.20$, $w_V = 0.15$, $w_C = 0.10$, $w_D = 0.20$, $w_P = 0.10$) reflect the relative importance of each geometric feature in the classification. The largest weights are assigned to area ($w_A$) and contact density ($w_D$), which are strong indicators of biological relevance.\n\n3.  **Classification**: The final step is to apply a threshold, $T = 0.70$, to the overall score $S$.\n    -   If $S \\ge 0.70$, the interface is classified as biologically obligate.\n    -   If $S < 0.70$, it is classified as a non-biological crystal contact.\n\nThe program will implement these calculations for each of the seven provided test cases and output the resulting boolean classifications in the specified format.
