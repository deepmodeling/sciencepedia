This exercise focuses on a key aspect of this interaction: the \"wobble\" phenomenon, which allows a single tRNA to decode multiple codons. By analyzing a tRNA containing the modified base inosine, you will apply the specific pairing rules that govern this flexibility, gaining a deeper appreciation for the genetic code's elegant degeneracy [@problem_id:1523836].", "problem": "The genetic code is read by pairing the codons of a messenger RNA (mRNA) with the anticodons of a transfer RNA (tRNA). This pairing occurs in an antiparallel fashion. The first two positions of the codon pair with the last two positions of the anticodon according to standard Watson-Crick base pairing rules (A with U, G with C). However, the pairing between the third position of mischievcodon (at the 3' end) and the first position of the anticodon (at the 5' end) is less strict, a phenomenon known as \"wobble.\"\n\nA special modified base, inosine (I), is sometimes found at the first position of the tRNA anticodon. Due to its unique structure, inosine at this \"wobble\" position can form hydrogen bonds with adenine (A), cytosine (C), or uracil (U) on the mRNA codon.

The given anticodon is `5'-IGU-3'`, which, when written antiparallel for base pairing, is `3'-UGI-5'`.\n\nApplying pairing rules:\n- At codon position $1$, $b_1$ pairs with anticodon U (strict), so $b_1=A$.\n- At codon position $2$, $b_2$ pairs with anticodon G (strict), so $b_2=C$.\n- At codon position $3$, $b_3$ pairs with anticodon I (wobble), and inosine pairs with $A$, $C$, or $U$, but not $G$, so $b_3\\in\\{A,C,U\\}$.\n\nTherefore, the recognized codons are `5'-ACA-3'`, `5'-ACC-3'`, and `5'-ACU-3'`.

This process is so crucial it's often called the \"second genetic code.\" This thought experiment probes the basis of this specificity by asking you to predict the outcome of a classic molecular biology experiment, revealing that the primary recognition signals, or \"identity elements,\" for an aaRS are not always located in the anticodon loop [@problem_id:2346065].", "problem": "In a molecular biology laboratory, a team is investigating the specificity of protein synthesis machinery. They perform a genetic engineering experiment on the gene encoding the transfer RNA for Alanine ($tRNA^{\\text{Ala}}$). Using site-directed mutagenesis, they precisely alter the three nucleotides of the anticodon, changing them from the Alanine anticodon (`5'-IGC-3'`, where I is Inosine) to the Glycine anticodon (`5'-UCC-3'`). All other regions of the tRNA molecule, including the acceptor stem, remain identical to the original $tRNA^{\\text{Ala}}$.\n\nThis synthetic, chimeric tRNA is then placed in a controlled *in vitro* reaction mixture. The mixture contains all necessary components for tRNA charging, including an abundance of both Alanine and Glycine amino acids, as well as the full complement of functional aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS), specifically including Alanine-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS) and Glycine-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS).\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the fate of this chimeric tRNA in the reaction mixture?\n\nA. The chimeric tRNA will be exclusively charged with Glycine, as the anticodon is the primary and sole determinant for recognition by the correct aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase.\n\nB. The chimeric tRNA will be exclusively charged with Alanine, because critical recognition sites for the Alanine-tRNA synthetase exist outside of the anticodon loop.\n\nC. The chimeric tRNA will be charged with both Alanine and Glycine in approximately equal amounts, as the conflicting recognition signals will lead to non-specific charging by both synthetases.\n\nD. The chimeric tRNA will not be charged with any amino acid, because the contradictory features will prevent recognition by either the Alanine-tRNA synthetase or the Glycine-tRNA synthetase.\n\nE. The chimeric tRNA will be recognized by the ribosome but will fail to deliver an amino acid, causing translation to stall.", "solution": "The aminoacylation (charging) of a tRNA is determined by identity elements recognized by its cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS). While some aaRSs use the anticodon as a major identity determinant, many rely primarily on sequence and structural elements elsewhere, especially in the acceptor stem and the discriminator base.\n\nFor $tRNA^{\\text{Ala}}$, the principal and historically well-defined identity determinant resides in the acceptor stem: the wobble base pair $G_3-U_{70}$. This single base pair is both necessary and sufficient for recognition by alanine-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS). Experimental evidence shows that:\n- Transplanting the $G_3-U_{70}$ pair into non-alanine tRNAs confers alanine charging by AlaRS.\n- Mutating $G_3-U_{70}$ in $tRNA^{\\text{Ala}}$ abolishes alanine charging.\n- The anticodon of $tRNA^{\\text{Ala}}$ is largely dispensable for recognition and charging by AlaRS.\n\nIn the engineered tRNA described, only the anticodon has been changed from the alanine anticodon to the glycine anticodon. All other regions, including the acceptor stem, remain identical to native $tRNA^{\\text{Ala}}$. Therefore:\n1. AlaRS will still recognize the unchanged alanine identity elements (notably the $G_3-U_{70}$ base pair) in the acceptor stem and will charge this tRNA with alanine.\n2. GlyRS relies on glycine tRNA identity elements that include features outside the anticodon; since these are absent in this chimeric tRNA, GlyRS will not efficiently recognize or charge it, despite the presence of a glycine anticodon.\n3. Because aminoacylation specificity is dictated by the synthetase–tRNA interaction rather than by the anticodon alone, changing only the anticodon will not redirect charging to glycine.\n\nConsequently, the chimeric tRNA will be exclusively charged with alanine. Options proposing exclusive glycine charging (A), mixed charging (C), no charging (D), or ribosomal stalling without aminoacylation (E) contradict the established identity rules for $tRNA^{\\text{Ala}}$ and the known dispensability of its anticodon for AlaRS recognition.\n\nThus, the correct prediction is that the chimeric tRNA will be charged with alanine due to recognition by AlaRS via identity elements outside the anticodon loop.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2346065"}, {"introduction": "The function of a tRNA molecule is intimately linked to the stability of its three-dimensional structure, which is maintained by base pairing.
