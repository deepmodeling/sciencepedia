Based on prior integrative evidence (e.g., linkage, variant burden, and expression), the prior probabilities that each gene harbors the causal variant are\n$P(G_1 \\text{ is causal}) = 0.5$, $P(G_2 \\text{ is causal}) = 0.3$, and $P(G_3 \\text{ is causal}) = 0.2$.\nThe laboratory initially commits to validate $G_1$.\n\nBefore validation is performed, an independent curation panel runs an orthogonal assay that can conclusively rule out a gene only if it is not causal, and it never eliminates the causal gene. Conditional on the laboratory’s initial commitment to $G_1$, the panel applies the following policy to announce one ruled-out gene among $\\{G_2, G_3\\}$:\n- If $G_1$ is causal (so both $G_2$ and $G_3$ are non-causal), the panel rules out $G_3$ with probability $0.73$ and rules out $G_2$ with probability $0.27$.\n- If $G_1$ is not causal, then exactly one of $\\{G_2, G_3\\}$ is non-causal; in this case, the panel deterministically rules out the non-causal gene (it never rules out the causal gene).\n\nYou observe that the panel announces that $G_3$ is ruled out.

It is a well-posed problem in probability theory, grounded in a plausible scenario from computational biology, with all necessary data provided and no internal contradictions. We may proceed with a formal solution.\n\nLet $C_i$ be the event that gene $G_i$ is the causal gene for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. The prior probabilities are given as:\n$$ P(C_1) = 0.5 $$\n$$ P(C_2) = 0.3 $$\n$$ P(C_3) = 0.2 $$\nThese events are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, as confirmed by the sum of their probabilities being $P(C_1) + P(C_2) + P(C_3) = 0.5 + 0.3 + 0.2 = 1.0$.\n\nLet $R_3$ be the event that the curation panel announces that gene $G_3$ is ruled out. We are asked to calculate the posterior probability that $G_2$ is causal, given the observation that $G_3$ was ruled out. This is the conditional probability $P(C_2 | R_3)$.\n\nWe will use Bayes' theorem to compute this posterior probability:\n$$ P(C_2 | R_3) = \\frac{P(R_3 | C_2) P(C_2)}{P(R_3)} $$\n\nTo use this formula, we must determine each term in the expression. The prior probability $P(C_2)$ is given as $0.3$. We need to find the conditional probability $P(R_3 | C_2)$ and the total probability $P(R_3)$.\n\nThe total probability $P(R_3)$ can be found using the law of total probability, by conditioning on the mutually exclusive and exhaustive events $C_1$, $C_2$, and $C_3$:\n$$ P(R_3) = P(R_3 | C_1) P(C_1) + P(R_3 | C_2) P(C_2) + P(R_3 | C_3) P(C_3) $$\n\nWe will now determine the conditional probabilities $P(R_3 | C_i)$ for each $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ based on the panel's policy described in the problem statement.\n\n1.  **Case 1: $G_1$ is causal (event $C_1$).**\n    The problem states that if $G_1$ is causal, the panel rules out $G_3$ with probability $0.73$.\n    Therefore, $P(R_3 | C_1) = 0.73$.\n\n2.  **Case 2: $G_2$ is causal (event $C_2$).**\n    In this case, $G_1$ is not causal. The problem states that if $G_1$ is not causal, the panel deterministically rules out the non-causal gene among $\\{G_2, G_3\\}$. Since $G_2$ is causal, $G_3$ must be non-causal. The panel, which never rules out the causal gene, must therefore rule out $G_3$.\n    Therefore, $P(R_3 | C_2) = 1$.\n\n3.  **Case 3: $G_3$ is causal (event $C_3$).**\n    The problem states that the panel \"never eliminates the causal gene\". If $G_3$ is causal, it cannot be ruled out.\n    Therefore, the probability of the panel ruling out $G_3$ given that $G_3$ is causal is zero: $P(R_3 | C_3) = 0$.\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the formula for the total probability $P(R_3)$:\n$$ P(R_3) = (0.73)(0.5) + (1)(0.3) + (0)(0.2) $$\n$$ P(R_3) = 0.365 + 0.3 + 0 $$\n$$ P(R_3) = 0.665 $$\n\nFinally, we can compute the desired posterior probability $P(C_2 | R_3)$ using Bayes' theorem:\n$$ P(C_2 | R_3) = \\frac{P(R_3 | C_2) P(C_2)}{P(R_3)} = \\frac{(1)(0.3)}{0.665} $$\n$$ P(C_2 | R_3) = \\frac{0.3}{0.665} \\approx 0.4511278... $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.

The task is to evaluate statements about conditional and marginal probabilities, which can be done using the fundamental principles cited.\n\nFirst, we estimate the required probabilities from the provided cell counts. Let $U_{up}$ denote the event that the gene is upregulated ($U=\\text{up}$), $R_{trt}$ the event of being in the treated group ($R=\\text{trt}$), $R_{ctl}$ the event of being in the control group ($R=\\text{ctl}$), $S_A$ the event of being from tissue $\\mathrm{A}$ ($S=\\mathrm{A}$), and $S_B$ the event of being from tissue $\\mathrm{B}$ ($S=\\mathrm{B}$). Probabilities are estimated as sample proportions.\n\nThe conditional probabilities of upregulation within each tissue (stratum) are:\nFor Tissue $\\mathrm{A}$:\n$$P(U_{up} \\mid R_{trt}, S_A) = \\frac{\\text{Number of upreg. cells in (trt, A)}}{\\text{Total cells in (trt, A)}} = \\frac{99}{900} = 0.11$$\n$$P(U_{up} \\mid R_{ctl}, S_A) = \\frac{\\text{Number of upreg. cells in (ctl, A)}}{\\text{Total cells in (ctl, A)}} = \\frac{10}{100} = 0.10$$\nHere, we observe $P(U_{up} \\mid R_{trt}, S_A) > P(U_{up} \\mid R_{ctl}, S_A)$.\n\nFor Tissue $\\mathrm{B}$:\n$$P(U_{up} \\mid R_{trt}, S_B) = \\frac{\\text{Number of upreg. cells in (trt, B)}}{\\text{Total cells in (trt, B)}} = \\frac{91}{100} = 0.91$$\n$$P(U_{up} \\mid R_{ctl}, S_B) = \\frac{\\text{Number of upreg. cells in (ctl, B)}}{\\text{Total cells in (ctl, B)}} = \\frac{810}{900} = 0.90$$\nHere, we observe $P(U_{up} \\mid R_{trt}, S_B) > P(U_{up} \\mid R_{ctl}, S_B)$.\nIn both tissues, the treatment is associated with a higher probability of gene upregulation.\n\nNext, we calculate the marginal probabilities of upregulation, aggregated across both tissues.\nFirst, we aggregate the counts:\nTotal cells in treated group: $N(R_{trt}) = 900 (\\text{from A}) + 100 (\\text{from B}) = 1000$.\nTotal upregulated cells in treated group: $N(U_{up}, R_{trt}) = 99 (\\text{from A}) + 91 (\\text{from B}) = 190$.\nTotal cells in control group: $N(R_{ctl}) = 100 (\\text{from A}) + 900 (\\text{from B}) = 1000$.\nTotal upregulated cells in control group: $N(U_{up}, R_{ctl}) = 10 (\\text{from A}) + 810 (\\text{from B}) = 820$.\n\nThe marginal conditional probabilities are:\n$$P(U_{up} \\mid R_{trt}) = \\frac{N(U_{up}, R_{trt})}{N(R_{trt})} = \\frac{190}{1000} = 0.19$$\n$$P(U_{up} \\mid R_{ctl}) = \\frac{N(U_{up}, R_{ctl})}{N(R_{ctl})} = \\frac{820}{1000} = 0.82$$\nMarginally, we observe $P(U_{up} \\mid R_{trt}) < P(U_{up} \\mid R_{ctl})$. The association has reversed its direction. This phenomenon is known as Simpson's Paradox.\n\nThe mechanism for this reversal is explained by the law of total probability:\n$$P(U_{up} \\mid R=r) = P(U_{up} \\mid R=r, S_A)P(S_A \\mid R=r) + P(U_{up} \\mid R=r, S_B)P(S_B \\mid R=r)$$\nThe weights $P(S=s \\mid R=r)$ are the proportions of each tissue within each treatment group.\nFor the treated group ($r=\\text{trt}$):\n$P(S_A \\mid R_{trt}) = \\frac{900}{1000} = 0.9$ and $P(S_B \\mid R_{trt}) = \\frac{100}{1000} = 0.1$.\nFor the control group ($r=\\text{ctl}$):\n$P(S_A \\mid R_{ctl}) = \\frac{100}{1000} = 0.1$ and $P(S_B \\mid R_{ctl}) = \\frac{900}{1000} = 0.9$.\nSince $P(S_A \\mid R_{trt}) \\neq P(S_A \\mid R_{ctl})$, the random variables $R$ and $S$ are not independent. The experimental design is unbalanced. The treated group is predominantly tissue $\\mathrm{A}$, which has a low upregulation rate (around $0.1$), while the control group is predominantly tissue $\\mathrm{B}$, which has a very high upregulation rate (around $0.9$).\n\nLet's check the marginal calculation using the law of total probability:\n$P(U_{up} \\mid R_{trt}) = (0.11)(0.9) + (0.91)(0.1) = 0.099 + 0.091 = 0.19$.\n$P(U_{up} \\mid R_{ctl}) = (0.10)(0.1) + (0.90)(0.9) = 0.010 + 0.810 = 0.82$.\nThe calculations are consistent. The reversal is caused by the different weights $P(S=s \\mid R=r)$ applied to the stratum-specific probabilities.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options.\n\nA. Within each tissue, $P(U=\\text{up} \\mid R=\\text{trt}, S=s) > P(U=\\text{up} \\mid R=\\text{ctl}, S=s)$ for both $s \\in \\{\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{B}\\}$, yet marginally $P(U=\\text{up} \\mid R=\\text{trt}) < P(U=\\text{up} \\mid R=\\text{ctl})$. This reversal occurs because $R$ and $S$ are not independent in the sample, so the law of total probability uses different weights $P(S=s \\mid R=r)$ across $r \\in \\{\\text{trt}, \\text{ctl}\\}$.\nThis statement accurately summarizes all of our findings. The direction of the conditional associations is correct ($>$), the direction of the marginal association is correct ($<$), and the explanation provided is precisely the mathematical reason for the observed reversal.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. Within each tissue, $P(U=\\text{up} \\mid R=\\text{trt}, S=s) < P(U=\\text{up} \\mid R=\\text{ctl}, S=s)$ for both tissues, but marginally $P(U=\\text{up} \\mid R=\\text{trt}) > P(U=\\text{up} \\mid R=\\text{ctl})$, so no paradox is present.\nThis statement makes two claims about the direction of inequalities that are the opposite of our calculations. Our stratum-specific comparisons show a `>` relationship, not `<`. Our marginal comparison shows a `<` relationship, not `>`. Therefore, the statement is factually incorrect and the conclusion that no paradox is present is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. The reversal between conditional and marginal comparisons would still occur even if $R$ and $S$ were independent, because Simpson’s Paradox is a property of conditional probabilities that does not depend on the distribution of $S$.\nThis statement is theoretically flawed. If $R$ and $S$ were independent, then $P(S=s \\mid R=r) = P(S=s)$ for all $r$. The law of total probability would use the same weights for both treatment and control groups.\nLet $w_A = P(S_A)$ and $w_B = P(S_B)$. Then the difference in marginal probabilities would be:\n$P(U_{up} \\mid R_{trt}) - P(U_{up} \\mid R_{ctl}) = [P(U_{up} \\mid R_{trt}, S_A) - P(U_{up} \\mid R_{ctl}, S_A)]w_A + [P(U_{up} \\mid R_{trt}, S_B) - P(U_{up} \\mid R_{ctl}, S_B)]w_B$.\nSince both terms in brackets are positive ($0.01$ in both cases) and weights $w_A, w_B$ are non-negative, the overall difference would be positive. The reversal would not occur. The paradox is intrinsically dependent on the non-independence of $R$ and $S$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. The correct way to obtain the marginal probability $P(U=\\text{up} \\mid R=r)$ is to average the tissue-specific probabilities $P(U=\\text{up} \\mid R=r, S=\\mathrm{A})$ and $P(U=\\text{up} \\mid R=r, S=\\mathrm{B})$ with equal weights, which guarantees the tissue composition cannot change the direction of the effect.\nThis statement confuses the definition of marginal probability with a method for statistical adjustment. The marginal probability for the given sample is what we calculated directly from the aggregated counts. Using equal weights is a form of standardization to a hypothetical population with a balanced tissue composition. While this procedure can be useful to remove the confounding effect, it does not yield the actual marginal probability of the observed data. Therefore, the premise is incorrect.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2418177"}, {"introduction": "Beyond data analysis, probability theory allows us to build predictive models of biological processes from first principles.

All necessary data are provided for a unique solution. The problem is well-posed and objective. Therefore, the problem is valid and we may proceed.\n\nLet $E$ be the event that a random point mutation changes a hydrophobic (H) amino acid to a hydrophilic ($\\Phi$) one. We seek to compute the probability $P(E)$.\n\nThe mutation process consists of two uniform random selections. First, a nucleotide position is chosen from the entire sequence. Let the sequence have $N$ codons, which means $3N$ nucleotide positions. The probability of choosing any specific position is $\\frac{1}{3N}$. Second, the nucleotide at that position is replaced by one of the $3$ other possible nucleotides, with a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$ for each choice. Thus, any specific mutation (a specific position changing to a specific new nucleotide) has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3N} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{9N}$. The total number of possible distinct single-nucleotide mutations in the sequence is $3N \\times 3 = 9N$.\n\nThe probability $P(E)$ is the ratio of the number of mutations that cause an H $\\to$ $\\Phi$ transition to the total number of possible mutations.\n$$P(E) = \\frac{\\text{Number of mutations causing H} \\to \\Phi}{\\text{Total number of possible mutations}}$$\nLet us denote the number of H $\\to$ $\\Phi$ mutations as $|E|$. The total number of mutations is $9N$.\nSo, $P(E) = \\frac{|E|}{9N}$.\n\nTo find $|E|$, we sum the contributions from all codons in the sequence. A more systematic approach is to average over the types of codons present. Let $f_c$ be the frequency of a codon $c$ in the sequence. The number of instances of codon $c$ is $N_c = N \\times f_c$. A transition H $\\to$ $\\Phi$ can only occur if the original codon $c$ is hydrophobic. For each instance of a hydrophobic codon $c$, there are $N_{\\to \\Phi}(c)$ single-nucleotide changes that result in a hydrophilic product.\n\nThe total number of H $\\to$ $\\Phi$ mutations is the sum over all hydrophobic codon types of the number of instances of that codon multiplied by the number of relevant mutations per codon:\n$$|E| = \\sum_{c \\, \\in \\, \\text{Hydrophobic}} N_c \\times N_{\\to \\Phi}(c) = \\sum_{c \\, \\in \\, \\text{Hydrophobic}} (N \\times f_c) \\times N_{\\to \\Phi}(c) = N \\sum_{c \\, \\in \\, \\text{Hydrophobic}} f_c \\times N_{\\to \\Phi}(c)$$\nSubstituting this into our expression for $P(E)$:\n$$P(E) = \\frac{N \\sum_{c \\, \\in \\, \\text{Hydrophobic}} f_c \\times N_{\\to \\Phi}(c)}{9N} = \\frac{1}{9} \\sum_{c \\, \\in \\, \\text{Hydrophobic}} f_c \\times N_{\\to \\Phi}(c)$$\nThis result is independent of the sequence length $N$, as it must be.\n\nOur next task is to determine the absolute frequencies $f_c$ for each relevant codon. We are given the overall frequency of hydrophobic codons, $f_H = 0.5$. We are also given conditional probabilities for an amino acid being Leucine or Valine, given it is hydrophobic.\nLet $E_{Leu}$ be the event that a randomly chosen codon codes for Leucine and $E_{Val}$ for Valine.\nThe problem states $P(E_{Leu} | H) = p_L = 0.6$ and $P(E_{Val} | H) = p_V = 0.4$. The total frequency of a codon encoding a specific amino acid is its probability in the sequence. By the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, the total frequency of Leucine codons is:\n$f_{Leu} = P(E_{Leu}) = P(E_{Leu} | H) \\times P(H) = 0.6 \\times 0.5 = 0.3$.\nSimilarly, the total frequency of Valine codons is:\n$f_{Val} = P(E_{Val}) = P(E_{Val} | H) \\times P(H) = 0.4 \\times 0.5 = 0.2$.\nNote that $f_{Leu} + f_{Val} = 0.3 + 0.2 = 0.5 = f_H$, which is consistent.\n\nNow we calculate the absolute frequency $f_c$ for each specific codon $c$ by multiplying the amino acid frequency by the conditional codon usage frequency. For a Leucine codon $c$: $f_c = P(C=c | E_{Leu}) \\times f_{Leu}$.\n$f_{\\mathrm{CTT}} = 0.15 \\times 0.3 = 0.045$\n$f_{\\mathrm{CTC}} = 0.25 \\times 0.3 = 0.075$\n$f_{\\mathrm{CTA}} = 0.10 \\times 0.3 = 0.030$\n$f_{\\mathrm{CTG}} = 0.30 \\times 0.3 = 0.090$\n$f_{\\mathrm{TTA}} = 0.10 \\times 0.3 = 0.030$\n$f_{\\mathrm{TTG}} = 0.10 \\times 0.3 = 0.030$\n\nFor Valine codons, $c$: $f_c = P(C=c | E_{Val}) \\times f_{Val}$.\n$f_{\\mathrm{GTT}} = 0.30 \\times 0.2 = 0.060$\n$f_{\\mathrm{GTC}} = 0.25 \\times 0.2 = 0.050$\n$f_{\\mathrm{GTA}} = 0.15 \\times 0.2 = 0.030$\n$f_{\\mathrm{GTG}} = 0.30 \\times 0.2 = 0.060$\n\nNow we substitute these frequencies and the given $N_{\\to \\Phi}(c)$ values into the expression for $P(E)$.\n$$P(E) = \\frac{1}{9} \\left( \\sum_{c \\, \\in \\, \\text{Leu}} f_c \\times N_{\\to \\Phi}(c) + \\sum_{c \\, \\in \\, \\text{Val}} f_c \\times N_{\\to \\Phi}(c) \\right)$$\nContribution from Leucine codons:\n$$ \\sum_{c \\, \\in \\, \\text{Leu}} f_c N_{\\to \\Phi}(c) = (0.045 \\times 2) + (0.075 \\times 2) + (0.030 \\times 2) + (0.090 \\times 2) + (0.030 \\times 1) + (0.030 \\times 1) $$\n$$ = 0.090 + 0.150 + 0.060 + 0.180 + 0.030 + 0.030 = 0.540 $$\nContribution from Valine codons:\n$$ \\sum_{c \\, \\in \\, \\text{Val}} f_c N_{\\to \\Phi}(c) = (0.060 \\times 1) + (0.050 \\times 1) + (0.030 \\times 1) + (0.060 \\times 1) $$\n$$ = 0.060 + 0.050 + 0.030 + 0.060 = 0.200 $$\nThe total sum is $0.540 + 0.200 = 0.740$.\nFinally, we calculate the probability $P(E)$:\n$$P(E) = \\frac{1}{9} \\times 0.740 = \\frac{0.74}{9} = \\frac{74}{900} = \\frac{37}{450}$$\nAs a decimal, this is $37 \\div 450 \\approx 0.082222...$.\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures. Rounding this value gives 0.08222.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.08222}$$", "id": "2418164"}]}
