The Newick format is a common standard for representing tree structures as text, which is essential for data exchange and analysis. This first practice challenges you to parse these Newick strings, giving you a hands-on opportunity to translate the abstract concepts of internal nodes (ancestors) and terminal nodes (leaves) into concrete, countable entities from a data file [@problem_id:2414817].", "problem": "A phylogenetic tree is a connected, acyclic graph whose terminal nodes represent observed taxa and whose internal nodes represent ancestral divergence points. The Newick representation encodes such a tree as a parenthesized, comma-separated structure that may optionally include labels and branch lengths. In this problem, a terminal node (leaf) is defined as any node with zero children in the rooted representation implied by the Newick string, and an internal node is any node with at least one child, including the top grouping. Labels and branch lengths do not affect whether a node is internal or terminal, and unlabeled internal nodes are permitted. For consistency across rooted and unrooted topologies, treat the topmost grouping as a root and use the parenthesis structure to determine child relations.\n\nWrite a program that, for each Newick string in the test suite below, determines the ordered pair $(I,L)$, where $I$ is the number of internal nodes and $L$ is the number of terminal nodes (leaves), according to the definitions above. Ignore any branch lengths and treat quoted or unquoted labels as opaque tokens. Each Newick string terminates with a semicolon and may include polytomies.\n\nYou must use exactly the following test suite of Newick strings (each is a literal to be parsed as given):\n- $T_1$: \"(A,B,(C,D));\"\n- $T_2$: \"A;\"\n- $T_3$: \"((A,B),C,(D,E,F));\"\n- $T_4$: \"((A:0.1,B:0.2)X:0.3,(C:1.0,D:2.0):3.0)Root;\"\n- $T_5$: \"(A,B,C);\"\n- $T_6$: \"((A,B,C)I1,(D,(E,F)I2)I3,G)I4;\"\n\nYour program must process the test suite in the order $(T_1,\\dots,T_6)$ and produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. The required format is a list of lists, where the $i$-th inner list is $[I_i,L_i]$, for $i \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$. For example, the output must have the exact form \"[[I1,L1],[I2,L2],[I3,L3],[I4,L4],[I5,L5],[I6,L6]]\" with no extra whitespace.\n\nNo external input is provided, and there are no physical units or angles involved. All outputs are integers. The program must be self-contained and deterministic.", "solution": "The problem statement has been rigorously analyzed and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the domain of computational biology, well-posed with unambiguous definitions, and expressed with objective, formal language. There are no contradictions, missing information, or logical flaws. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe task is to determine the number of internal nodes, $I$, and terminal nodes (leaves), $L$, for a given set of phylogenetic trees represented in the Newick format. The problem provides precise definitions for these entities based on the parenthetical structure of the Newick string.\n\nAn **internal node** is defined as any node with at least one child. In the Newick format, a collection of one or more children is represented by a comma-separated list enclosed in parentheses, such as `(A,B)`. The parentheses themselves signify the existence of a parent node for the enclosed children. Therefore, each opening parenthesis, `(`, introduces a new internal node. The total count of internal nodes, $I$, in a given Newick string is consequently equal to the total count of opening parentheses.\n\n$$I = \\text{count of character } '('$$\n\nA **terminal node**, or leaf, is defined as a node with zero children. In the Newick string, these correspond to taxon labels that do not have an associated child list. For example, in `(A,(B,C))`, `A`, `B`, and `C` are leaves, whereas the node represented by `(B,C)` is internal. The problem specifies that labels for internal nodes are permissible (e.g., `(B,C)X`), and these must be distinguished from leaf labels. A key structural observation is that a label for an internal node immediately follows the closing parenthesis of its child list, as in `...)label`. Leaf labels, by contrast, do not. They typically follow an opening parenthesis `(` or a comma `,`.\n\nThis distinction forms the basis of our algorithm for counting leaves. We first identify all alphanumeric strings that represent labels in the tree. Then, we identify the subset of these labels that correspond to internal nodes. The set of leaf labels is the set difference between all labels and the internal node labels.\n\nThe complete algorithm is as follows:\n\n1.  For each Newick string $T_i$ provided in the test suite:\n2.  **Pre-process the string**: The problem states that branch lengths should be ignored. These are represented by a colon followed by a number, e.g., `:0.1`. We remove these substrings to simplify parsing. We use a regular expression to substitute any occurrence of the pattern `r':[\\d\\.]+'` with an empty string. This correctly removes branch lengths without affecting node labels. Let the resulting string be $T'_i$.\n3.  **Calculate the number of internal nodes ($I_i$):** As established, this is the total count of opening parentheses in the string.\n    $$I_i = T'_i.\\text{count}('(')$$\n4.  **Calculate the number of leaf nodes ($L_i$):**\n    a.  First, we extract all potential node labels from $T'_i$. Assuming labels are composed of alphanumeric characters (as is consistent with the test suite), we find all non-overlapping matches of the regular expression `r'[a-zA-Z0-9]+'`. Let this set be $\\mathcal{A}$.\n    b.  Next, we identify the labels of internal nodes. These are the labels that immediately follow a closing parenthesis. We find all such labels using the regular expression `r'\\)([a-zA-Z0-9]+)'`. Let this set of internal labels be $\\mathcal{I}$.\n    c.  The number of leaves, $L_i$, is the cardinality of the set of all labels minus the cardinality of the set of internal labels.\n    $$L_i = |\\mathcal{A}| - |\\mathcal{I}|$$\n5.  The result for each tree $T_i$ is the ordered pair $(I_i, L_i)$. The final output is an aggregation of these pairs in the specified list format.\n\nLet us apply this algorithm to test case $T_4$: `((A:0.1,B:0.2)X:0.3,(C:1.0,D:2.0):3.0)Root;`.\n\n1.  **Pre-processing**: Removing branch lengths (`:0.1`, `:0.2`, `:0.3`, `:1.0`, `:2.0`, `:3.0`) yields the string $T'_4 = ((A,B)X,(C,D))Root;$.\n2.  **Internal nodes**: $I_4 = T'_4.\\text{count}('(') = 3$.\n3.  **Leaf nodes**:\n    a.  All labels $\\mathcal{A}$ found with `r'[a-zA-Z0-9]+'` are `{A, B, X, C, D, Root}`. The cardinality is $|\\mathcal{A}|=6$.\n    b.  Internal labels $\\mathcal{I}$ found with `r'\\)([a-zA-Z0-9]+)'` are `{X, Root}`. The cardinality is $|\\mathcal{I}|=2$.\n    c.  $L_4 = |\\mathcal{A}| - |\\mathcal{I}| = 6 - 2 = 4$. The leaves are `{A, B, C, D}`.\n4.  The resulting pair is $(I_4, L_4) = (3, 4)$.\n\nThis procedure is deterministic and correctly handles all provided test cases, including those with polytomies and unlabeled internal nodes.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport re\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the phylogenetic tree node counting problem for a fixed test suite.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        \"(A,B,(C,D));\",                                      # T_1\n        \"A;\",                                                # T_2\n        \"((A,B),C,(D,E,F));\",                                # T_3\n        \"((A:0.1,B:0.2)X:0.3,(C:1.0,D:2.0):3.0)Root;\",       # T_4\n        \"(A,B,C);\",                                          # T_5\n        \"((A,B,C)I1,(D,(E,F)I2)I3,G)I4;\",                     # T_6\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for newick_string in test_cases:\n        # Step 1: Pre-process the string to remove branch lengths.\n        # The regex targets a colon followed by digits and optional decimal points.\n        # This is sufficient for the given test cases.\n        clean_string = re.sub(r\":[\\d\\.]+\", \"\", newick_string)\n\n        # Step 2: Count internal nodes (I).\n        # An internal node is represented by a pair of parentheses '()'.\n        # The number of internal nodes is the number of opening parentheses.\n        internal_nodes = clean_string.count('(')\n\n        # Step 3: Count leaf nodes (L).\n        # First, find all alphanumeric tokens, which represent all labels (leaf and internal).\n        # A simple alphanumeric regex is sufficient for the test suite.\n        all_labels = re.findall(r\"[a-zA-Z0-9]+\", clean_string)\n        \n        # Next, find labels that specifically belong to internal nodes.\n        # These are defined as labels that immediately follow a closing parenthesis ')'.\n        internal_labels = re.findall(r\"\\)([a-zA-Z0-9]+)\", clean_string)\n        \n        # The number of leaf nodes is the total number of labels minus the number of internal node labels.\n        leaf_nodes = len(all_labels) - len(internal_labels)\n        \n        results.append([internal_nodes, leaf_nodes])\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format: [[I1,L1],[I2,L2],...]\n    # We manually construct the string to avoid extra whitespace introduced by default print behavior.\n    output_str = \"[\" + \",\".join([f\"[{i},{l}]\" for i, l in results]) + \"]\"\n    print(output_str)\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2414817"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply identifying the components of a tree, its true value lies in mapping the evolutionary relationships between taxa.

Intersection is $\\{1\\}$. State set is $\\{1\\}$.\n- For $v_{CD}$, children have states $\\{1\\}$ and $\\{0\\}$. Intersection is empty. Union is $\\{0,1\\}$. State set is $\\{0,1\\}$. This step adds $1$ to the score.\n- For $v_{ABCD}$, children are $v_{AB}$ with state set $\\{1\\}$ and $v_{CD}$ with state set $\\{0,1\\}$. Intersection is $\\{1\\}$. State set is $\\{1\\}$.\n- For $v_{Root}$, children are $v_{ABCD}$ with state set $\\{1\\}$ and $E$ with state set $\\{0\\}$. Intersection is empty. Union is $\\{0,1\\}$. State set is $\\{0,1\\}$.

Reconstruct Ancestral States for all Most Parsimonious Reconstructions (MPRs)**\nWe need to find all assignments of states to internal nodes that result in exactly $2$ changes. The problem mandates \"outgroup polarization,\" which means the state of the outgroup, $S(E)=0$, determines the state at the root. Thus, we must set $S(v_{Root})=0$.\n\nWe now analyze the possible state assignments for the other internal nodes that are consistent with $S(v_{Root})=0$ and $L=2$.\n\n**Scenario 1: The \"Paraphyly\" Reconstruction (DELTRAN-like optimization)**\nThis scenario posits a single origin of state $1$ followed by a reversal.\n- $S(v_{Root}) = 0$.\n- For state $1$ to appear in the ingroup $\\{A,B,C,D\\}$, it must originate on the branch leading to $v_{ABCD}$. So, $S(v_{ABCD})=1$. This is change #1: $0 \\to 1$.\n- For the clade $(A,B)$, with $S(A)=1$ and $S(B)=1$, the most parsimonious assignment for their ancestor is $S(v_{AB})=1$. This involves no additional changes from its parent $v_{ABCD}$.\n- For the clade $(C,D)$, with parent $v_{ABCD}$ having state $1$, we consider $v_{CD}$. To satisfy the states of its children $S(C)=1$ and $S(D)=0$, we can set $S(v_{CD})=1$. This involves no change from its parent $v_{ABCD}$. The state $0$ in taxon $D$ must then be explained by a reversal on the terminal branch leading to $D$. This is change #2: $1 \\to 0$.\n- **Summary of MPR 1**: A single gain of state $1$ on the branch leading to $v_{ABCD}$, and a single loss (reversal) of state $1$ on the branch leading to $D$. The total number of changes is $2$.\n- **Interpretation**: The MRCA of the group $\\{A,B,C\\}$ is $v_{ABCD}$. In this reconstruction, $S(v_{ABCD})=1$. The group $\\{A,B,C\\}$ is formed from an ancestor with state $1$ ($v_{ABCD}$), but excludes one of that ancestor's descendants ($D$), which lost the character. This is the definition of a **paraphyletic** group.\n\n**Scenario 2: The \"Polyphyly\" Reconstruction (ACCTRAN-like optimization)**\nThis scenario posits multiple independent origins of state $1$.\n- $S(v_{Root}) = 0$.\n- Let us assume state $1$ does not arise on the branch leading to $v_{ABCD}$. We set $S(v_{ABCD})=0$. This involves no change from the root.\n- To explain $S(A)=1$ and $S(B)=1$, state $1$ must originate on the branch leading to their ancestor, $v_{AB}$. So, $S(v_{AB})=1$. This is change #1: $0 \\to 1$ on the branch $v_{ABCD} \\to v_{AB}$.\n- For clade $(C,D)$, its parent $v_{ABCD}$ has state $0$. We can set $S(v_{CD})=0$ to match its child $D$ and its parent. This involves no change.\n- To explain $S(C)=1$, state $1$ must originate independently on the terminal branch leading to $C$. This is change #2: $0 \\to 1$ on the branch $v_{CD} \\to C$.\n- **Summary of MPR 2**: Two independent gains (parallelisms) of state $1$: one on the branch to $v_{AB}$ and one on the branch to $C$. The total number of changes is $2$.\n- **Interpretation**: The MRCA of the group $\\{A,B,C\\}$ is $v_{ABCD}$. In this reconstruction, $S(v_{ABCD})=0$. The defining character state ($1$) is absent in the group's most recent common ancestor. The group is defined by a trait that evolved convergently. This is the definition of a **polyphyletic** group.\n\n**Conclusion of Analysis**\nThere are two equally parsimonious reconstructions, each requiring a minimum of $2$ changes. One reconstruction implies the group $\\{A,B,C\\}$ is paraphyletic. The other implies the group $\\{A,B,C\\}$ is polyphyletic. In neither case is the group monophyletic, as the full clade descended from $v_{ABCD}$ is $\\{A,B,C,D\\}$. Therefore, the phylogenetic status of the group $\\{A,B,C\\}$ is ambiguous under maximum parsimony.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. The set $\\{A,B,C\\}$ is monophyletic on the given rooted tree.**\nThis is incorrect. The Most Recent Common Ancestor of $\\{A,B,C\\}$ is $v_{ABCD}$, whose complete set of descendants is $\\{A,B,C,D\\}$. The group $\\{A,B,C\\}$ excludes taxon $D$, thus it is not monophyletic.\n\n**B.
