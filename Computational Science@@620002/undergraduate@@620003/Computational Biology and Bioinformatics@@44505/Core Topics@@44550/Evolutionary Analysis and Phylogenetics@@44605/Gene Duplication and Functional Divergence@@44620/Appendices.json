It is scientifically grounded in the principles of population genetics and molecular evolution, specifically regarding gene duplication, fitness costs, and the interplay between selection and genetic drift. The problem is well-posed, objective, self-contained, and provides all necessary information and definitions to compute a unique solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute the minimum selective advantage, denoted $s_{\\min}$, that a newly duplicated gene must confer to be retained by selection. The problem provides a specific criterion for this retention.\n\nFirst, we must quantify the initial fitness cost associated with the duplication event. The problem states that the duplicate gene imposes a burden due to the cost of its expression. This cost, $C$, is proportional to the proteome mass fraction, $f_{d}$, that the duplicate's protein product occupies. The constant of proportionality is given as $k$.\n\nThe fitness reduction is therefore $k \\times f_{d}$. The initial selection coefficient due purely to this burden is given as $-C$. Thus, the cost $C$ is:\n$$\nC = k \\cdot f_{d}\n$$\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Proportionality coefficient, $k = 1.5$.\n- Proteome mass fraction of the duplicate, $f_{d} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3}$.\n\nSubstituting these values, we calculate the expression cost $C$:\n$$\nC = 1.5 \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-3}) = 7.5 \\times 10^{-3}\n$$\nThis is a dimensionless quantity, representing the selection coefficient against the duplicate gene due to its expression burden alone.\n\nNext, the problem posits that the duplicate gene acquires a novel function that provides a beneficial selection coefficient, $s$. The net selection coefficient of the duplicate, $s_{\\text{net}}$, which accounts for both the new benefit and the existing cost, is defined as:\n$$\ns_{\\text{net}} = s - C\n$$\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the definition provided for \"retention by selection.\" This condition is met if the duplicate's net selection coefficient, $s_{\\text{net}}$, exceeds the magnitude of the genetic drift barrier. The drift barrier represents the threshold below which selection is ineffective compared to the stochastic effects of genetic drift. The problem specifies this barrier's magnitude for a new mutation in a Wright–Fisher population as $\\frac{1}{2N_{e}}$, where $N_{e}$ is the effective population size.\n\nThe effective population size is given as $N_{e} = 10^{7}$.\n\nThe condition for retention by selection is therefore expressed as the following inequality:\n$$\ns_{\\text{net}} > \\frac{1}{2N_{e}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $s_{\\text{net}}$, we get:\n$$\ns - C > \\frac{1}{2N_{e}}\n$$\nWe are asked to find the minimum selective advantage, $s_{\\min}$, required for retention. This minimum value corresponds to the boundary condition of the inequality. That is, $s_{\\min}$ is the value of $s$ for which the net selective advantage is exactly equal to the drift barrier magnitude. Any value of $s$ greater than this $s_{\\min}$ will satisfy the condition for retention.\n$$\ns_{\\min} - C = \\frac{1}{2N_{e}}\n$$\nSolving for $s_{\\min}$, we obtain:\n$$\ns_{\\min} = C + \\frac{1}{2N_{e}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the known values for $C$ and $N_{e}$ into this equation.\n$$\ns_{\\min} = (7.5 \\times 10^{-3}) + \\frac{1}{2 \\times 10^{7}}\n$$\nLet's evaluate the drift barrier term:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2 \\times 10^{7}} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-7} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-8}\n$$\nNow, we can compute the value of $s_{\\min}$:\n$$\ns_{\\min} = 0.0075 + 0.00000005 = 0.00750005\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures of $0.00750005$ are $7$, $5$, $0$, and $0$. The digit following the fourth significant figure is $0$, so we round down (i.e., truncate at that position).\nThe value of $s_{\\min}$ rounded to four significant figures is $0.007500$.\n\nThis result indicates that for the duplicate gene to overcome its significant expression cost of $C=0.0075$ and also overcome the drift barrier in this large population, the new beneficial function it acquires must provide a selective advantage of at least $s_{\\min} \\approx 0.007500$. The contribution from the drift barrier ($5.0 \\times 10^{-8}$) is several orders of magnitude smaller than the expression cost, meaning the primary challenge for the gene's retention is overcoming the burden it imposes on the cell.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.007500}\n$$", "id": "2393323"}, {"introduction": "Once a duplicated gene is retained, it provides a substrate for evolutionary innovation, often through changes in its regulation. This problem explores a common mechanism of divergence: the modification of regulatory elements in untranslated regions. You will model how the loss of an upstream open reading frame (uORF) in one gene copy leads to a dramatic change in protein output, illustrating a classic case of regulatory subfunctionalization.", "problem": "A eukaryotic gene has a single upstream open reading frame (uORF) in its $5'$ untranslated region that modulates translation of the main open reading frame (ORF) by the scanning mechanism. Let the following hold for a single messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) molecule under a fixed cellular condition: when a scanning ribosome encounters the uORF start codon, it initiates there with probability $r = 0.7$; after translating the uORF and terminating, the ribosome remains competent to reinitiate at the main start codon with probability $q = 0.2$; whenever a ribosome arrives at the main start codon, it initiates there with probability $e = 0.8$. Assume initiation at the main start codon is rate-limiting for protein output, elongation and termination are not limiting, and mRNA abundance and sequence of the main ORF are otherwise identical in all scenarios below.\n\nAfter a gene duplication event, one copy retains the uORF while the other copy loses the uORF entirely (the $5'$ leader becomes uORF-free).

Loss of the uORF changes the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein, causing immediate neofunctionalization of protein activity without affecting translation levels.", "solution": "The problem statement will first be validated for scientific and logical integrity.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe following parameters and conditions are provided in the problem statement:\n- A eukaryotic gene has a single upstream open reading frame (uORF) in its $5'$ untranslated region.\n- The uORF modulates translation of the main open reading frame (ORF) via the scanning mechanism.\n- Probability of a scanning ribosome initiating at the uORF start codon: $r = 0.7$.\n- Probability of a ribosome reinitiating at the main ORF after translating the uORF: $q = 0.2$.\n- Probability of a ribosome initiating at the main ORF when it arrives there: $e = 0.8$.\n- After a gene duplication event, one copy (Copy $1$) retains the uORF, and the other copy (Copy $2$) loses the uORF.\n- The mRNA expression level of each duplicate is the same as the ancestral single-copy gene.\n- Initiation at the main ORF is the rate-limiting step for protein output.\n- The sequence of the main ORF is identical in the ancestor and both duplicates.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem describes a well-established mechanism of translational regulation involving uORFs and provides a simplified, but coherent, probabilistic model based on the ribosome scanning model.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The premise is based on known principles of molecular biology. uORFs are common regulatory elements in eukaryotes, and their role in modulating translation via leaky scanning and reinitiation is a major area of research. The model of partitioning ribosomes between bypassing, translating the uORF, and reinitiating is a standard conceptual framework. The scenario of gene duplication followed by regulatory divergence (subfunctionalization) is a key concept in molecular evolution. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined with specific probabilities and a distinct question. The assumptions (e.g., initiation is rate-limiting, identical mRNA levels) make the problem solvable and lead to a unique quantitative answer.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise and unbiased. The parameters $r$, $q$, and $e$ are given as objective probabilities.\n- **Complete**: The problem provides all necessary information to calculate the relative protein outputs. No critical data is missing.\n- **Consistent**: The given probabilities ($0.7$, $0.2$, $0.8$) are all within the valid range for probabilities ($[0,1]$). There are no internal contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in computational biology. The solution will proceed by calculating the expected protein output for each case and evaluating the given options.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe protein output is stated to be proportional to the rate of successful initiation at the main ORF. We can model this by calculating the probability ($P_{init}$) that a single ribosome, having loaded onto the $5'$ end of an mRNA, will successfully initiate translation at the main ORF.\n\n**1. Ancestral Gene (and Duplicate Copy 1, with uORF)**\n\nFor the gene containing the uORF, a scanning ribosome has two mutually exclusive pathways to reach the main ORF:\n\n- **Pathway 1: Leaky Scanning.** The ribosome scans past the uORF start codon without initiating. This occurs with probability $1-r$. It then reaches the main ORF start codon and initiates with probability $e$. The probability of this path is $P_1 = (1-r)e$.\n- **Pathway 2: Reinitiation.** The ribosome initiates at the uORF start codon (probability $r$). After completing translation of the uORF, it remains on the mRNA and competent to reinitiate with probability $q$. It then scans to the main ORF start codon and initiates with probability $e$. The probability of this path is $P_2 = rqe$.\n\nThe total probability of initiation for a uORF-containing mRNA, $P_{uORF}$, is the sum of the probabilities of these two paths:\n$$P_{uORF} = P_1 + P_2 = (1-r)e + rqe = e(1-r+rq) = e(1-r(1-q))$$\nSubstituting the given values $r=0.7$, $q=0.2$, and $e=0.8$:\n$$P_{uORF} = 0.8 \\times (1 - 0.7(1-0.2)) = 0.8 \\times (1 - 0.7 \\times 0.8) = 0.8 \\times (1 - 0.56) = 0.8 \\times 0.44 = 0.352$$\nSo, the relative protein output from the single-copy ancestral gene is proportional to $0.352$.\n\n**2. Duplicate Copy 2 (without uORF)**\n\nFor the gene copy that has lost the uORF, the situation is simpler. A scanning ribosome proceeds directly to the main ORF start codon without any intervening uORF. It then initiates with probability $e$.\nThe probability of initiation for a uORF-free mRNA, $P_{no-uORF}$, is:\n$$P_{no-uORF} = e = 0.8$$\nSo, the relative protein output from this duplicate is proportional to $0.8$.\n\n**3. Total Protein Output After Duplication**\n\nAfter duplication, the cell contains two gene copies, each expressed at the same mRNA level as the ancestor. Therefore, the total protein output is the sum of the outputs from both copies.\n- Ancestral protein output: $O_{anc} \\propto P_{uORF} = 0.352$.\n- Total output after duplication: $O_{total} \\propto P_{uORF} + P_{no-uORF} = 0.352 + 0.8 = 1.152$.\n\nThe fold change in total protein output relative to the ancestral state is the ratio of the total new output to the ancestral output:\n$$\\text{Fold Change} = \\frac{O_{total}}{O_{anc}} = \\frac{P_{uORF} + P_{no-uORF}}{P_{uORF}} = \\frac{1.152}{0.352} \\approx 3.2727...$$\nThis is approximately a $3.27$-fold increase.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Total protein output increases by approximately $3.27$ fold relative to the ancestral gene, and the duplicates partition regulation: the uORF-free copy produces a constitutively higher, uORF-unregulated output, whereas the uORF-containing copy remains translationally repressed by the uORF (regulatory subfunctionalization).**\n\n- **Numerical Part**: Our calculation shows the total protein output increases by a factor of $\\frac{1.152}{0.352} \\approx 3.27$, which matches the value given.\n- **Qualitative Part**:\n    - The uORF-free copy's output is proportional to $0.8$.\n    - The uORF-containing copy's output is proportional to $0.352$.\n    - The uORF-free copy indeed produces a higher output ($0.8 > 0.352$). This output is constitutive in the sense that it is no longer subject to regulation by the uORF.\n    - The uORF-containing copy remains repressed by the uORF (output is $0.352$ compared to the potential $0.8$ without the uORF).\n    - This partitioning of an ancestral regulatory function (here, the potential for uORF-mediated repression) into two specialized daughter genes (one constitutively high, one repressed/regulated) is a textbook example of regulatory subfunctionalization.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The copy that lost the uORF becomes nonfunctional due to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), so total protein output decreases below the ancestral level.**\n\n- The loss of a uORF, which is located in the $5'$ UTR, does not introduce a premature termination codon into the main ORF. Therefore, it does not trigger NMD of the main ORF transcript. This premise is factually incorrect.\n- Our calculation shows that total protein output increases by a factor of $\\approx 3.27$, not decreases.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Both duplicates produce equal protein amounts and remain equally responsive to uORF-mediated regulation, so there is no functional divergence in translation.**\n\n- The protein amounts are not equal. The output from the uORF-free copy is proportional to $0.8$, while the output from the uORF-containing copy is proportional to $0.352$. These are significantly different.\n- Only the uORF-containing copy remains responsive to uORF-mediated regulation. The uORF-free copy has lost this regulatory capacity.\n- Therefore, there is clear functional divergence in translation.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The uORF-free copy produces lower protein output than the uORF-containing copy because removal of the uORF reduces ribosome loading onto the main ORF.**\n\n- Our calculation shows the uORF-free copy produces higher output ($0.8$) than the uORF-containing copy ($0.352$).\n- The reasoning is backwards. A uORF acts as an impediment, reducing the number of ribosomes that can successfully initiate at the main ORF. Its removal *increases* ribosome initiation at the main ORF, leading to higher protein output.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Loss of the uORF changes the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein, causing immediate neofunctionalization of protein activity without affecting translation levels.**\n\n- The uORF is in the $5'$ untranslated region. Its removal has no effect on the coding sequence of the main ORF. Therefore, the amino acid sequence of the protein product is unchanged.\n- The statement that translation levels are not affected is directly contradicted by our calculation, which shows a dramatic change in translational efficiency for the uORF-free copy ($0.352$ vs $0.8$).\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2393252"}, {"introduction": "The genomes of modern organisms are a living record of ancient evolutionary events.
