In phylogenetic inference under the principle of Maximum Parsimony (MP), a site is called parsimony-informative if its character-state distribution can discriminate among alternative unrooted tree topologies by implying different minimum numbers of state changes. For DNA characters with four possible nucleotides, assume the following interpretation from first principles: a site is parsimony-informative if and only if at least $2$ distinct nucleotides are present, and each of at least $2$ of these distinct nucleotides occurs in at least $2$ taxa. Ambiguous characters denoted by N and gaps denoted by - are treated as missing data and do not contribute to counts; a site is counted as parsimony-informative only if the unambiguous observations alone satisfy the stated criterion.\n\nDefine, in your own words, what a parsimony-informative site is based on the above principle, and then compute the total number of parsimony-informative sites in the following alignment.

The provided definition is a correct and formal statement of the necessary and sufficient conditions for a site to be parsimony-informative in an analysis of $4$ taxa. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary data and a clear, unambiguous criterion for evaluation, ensuring a unique solution. It is objective and free of any scientific or logical flaws. The problem is therefore **valid**.\n\nProceeding to the solution.\n\nA parsimony-informative site, based on the provided principle, is a column in a sequence alignment that provides evidence to favor one unrooted phylogenetic tree topology over others. For $4$ taxa, there are $3$ possible unrooted trees. A site can discriminate among these trees only if it supports a specific grouping of taxa. This requires a character distribution where at least two taxa share one character state, and at least two other taxa share a different character state. The pattern is thus of the form `x-x-y-y`. Any other pattern, such as `x-x-x-x` (invariant), `x-x-x-y` (singleton), or `w-x-y-z` (all unique), will require the same minimum number of changes on all $3$ possible tree topologies and is thus uninformative for selecting the most parsimonious tree. The given rule is a formalization of this principle: for a site to be informative, it must contain at least two different character states, and at least two of those states must appear at least twice.\n\nWe analyze each of the $20$ sites according to this criterion, ignoring any `N` or `-` characters.\n\nLet $S_i$ be the set of characters at site $i$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of computational biology, specifically phylogenetic reconstruction using maximum parsimony. It is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to derive a unique solution.\n\nThe problem requires the construction of a binary site pattern for four taxa, $\\{A, B, C, D\\}$, that yields different maximum parsimony (MP) scores on two distinct unrooted binary tree topologies. The states for the site are given as $0$ and $1$. The two tree topologies are $T_{1}=((A,B),(C,D))$ and $T_{2}=((A,C),(B,D))$. The MP score for the site pattern on a tree $T$ is denoted by $S(T)$. We are required to find a pattern such that $S(T_{1})=1$ and $S(T_{2})=2$. Finally, we must compute the difference $\\Delta=S(T_{2})-S(T_{1})$.\n\nAn unrooted binary tree for $4$ taxa has two internal nodes and one internal edge. The topology of such a tree is defined by the partition of the four taxa into two groups of two, which are separated by the internal edge.\n- The tree $T_{1}=((A,B),(C,D))$ corresponds to the partition where taxa $A$ and $B$ are grouped together, and taxa $C$ and $D$ are grouped together. The internal edge separates the clade $(A,B)$ from the clade $(C,D)$.\n- The tree $T_{2}=((A,C),(B,D))$ corresponds to the partition where taxa $A$ and $C$ are grouped together, and taxa $B$ and $D$ are grouped together. The internal edge separates the clade $(A,C)$ from the clade $(B,D)$.\n\nThe MP score of a site on a tree is the minimum number of state changes (substitutions) along the branches required to explain the states observed at the leaves (taxa). For a site to be informative under the parsimony criterion for $4$ taxa, it must have two taxa with one state and the other two taxa with the other state. Other patterns are uninformative: if all taxa have the same state, the score is $0$ on any tree; if one taxon differs from the other three, the score is $1$ on any tree.\n\nWe need to find a site pattern that is \"cheaper\" on $T_{1}$ than on $T_{2}$. This occurs when the partition of states in the site pattern aligns with the partition of taxa in the tree topology.\nThe condition $S(T_{1})=1$ suggests that the site pattern should match the bipartition $\\{A,B\\}|\\{C,D\\}$ defined by $T_{1}$. Let us construct such a pattern. We assign state $0$ to taxa $A$ and $B$, and state $1$ to taxa $C$ and $D$. The site pattern is thus an assignment of states $(s_{A}, s_{B}, s_{C}, s_{D}) = (0, 0, 1, 1)$.\n\nLet us calculate the MP score for this site pattern on both trees.\n\nCalculation for $T_{1}=((A,B),(C,D))$:\nThe tree groups $A$ and $B$, which both have state $0$. It also groups $C$ and $D$, which both have state $1$. We can explain the states at the leaves by postulating a single state change on the internal edge. For example, the ancestral node for $(A,B)$ can be assigned state $0$ (cost $0$), the ancestral node for $(C,D)$ can be assigned state $1$ (cost $0$), and the internal edge connecting these two nodes must then have one change (from $0$ to $1$ or vice versa), at a cost of $1$. The total minimal number of changes is $1$. Therefore, $S(T_{1})=1$.\n\nCalculation for $T_{2}=((A,C),(B,D))$:\nThe tree groups $A$ (state $0$) with $C$ (state $1$). It also groups $B$ (state $0$) with $D$ (state $1$). We use Fitch's algorithm to determine the score. An unrooted $4$-taxon tree has two internal nodes, say $u$ and $v$. In $T_{2}$, $u$ is the parent of leaves $A$ and $C$, and $v$ is the parent of leaves $B$ and $D$.\n- At node $u$, the children's states are $0$ and $1$. The set of possible states for the children are $S_{A}=\\{0\\}$ and $S_{C}=\\{1\\}$. Since $S_{A} \\cap S_{C} = \\emptyset$, a state change is required. The state set for $u$ is $S_{u} = S_{A} \\cup S_{C} = \\{0,1\\}$, and this step contributes $1$ to the total score.\n- At node $v$, the children's states are $0$ and $1$. The set of possible states for the children are $S_{B}=\\{0\\}$ and $S_{D}=\\{1\\}$. Since $S_{B} \\cap S_{D} = \\emptyset$, another state change is required. The state set for $v$ is $S_{v} = S_{B} \\cup S_{D} = \\{0,1\\}$, and this step contributes another $1$ to the total score.\n- The states of the internal nodes $u$ and $v$ are now considered. Since $S_{u} \\cap S_{v} = \\{0,1\\} \\cap \\{0,1\\} = \\{0,1\\} \\neq \\emptyset$, no additional change is required on the internal edge connecting them.\nThe total MP score is the sum of the changes, which is $1+1=2$.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem requires finding the number of nontrivial bipartitions in the strict consensus tree derived from the set of most-parsimonious trees for a given alignment of $5$ taxa. The analysis proceeds as follows.\n\nFirst, we must understand the parsimony principle in this context. A phylogenetic tree is evaluated by its parsimony score, which is the minimum number of character state changes required to explain the observed character states at the leaves (taxa). The total parsimony score for a tree is the sum of the scores for all individual sites. The most-parsimonious trees (MPTs) are those with the minimum total score.\n\nThe taxon set is $\\{A,B,C,D,E\\}$. The character data are provided for two sites:\n-   Site $1$: $A=1$, $B=1$, $C=0$, $D=0$, $E=0$.\n-   Site $2$: $A=1$, $C=1$, $B=0$, $D=0$, $E=0$.\n\nWe analyze each site to determine which tree topologies it supports. A site is parsimony-informative if it has at least two different character states, with each state appearing in at least two taxa. For such sites, different tree topologies will yield different parsimony scores.\n\nFor Site $1$, the taxa are partitioned according to their character state: those with state $1$, $\\{A,B\\}$, and those with state $0$, $\\{C,D,E\\}$. A tree that groups $\\{A,B\\}$ separately from $\\{C,D,E\\}$ represents the bipartition $\\{A,B\\} | \\{C,D,E\\}$. On any such tree, the minimum number of changes for Site $1$ is $1$. This is the minimal possible score for a parsimony-informative site. Any tree that does not contain this bipartition will require more changes (a score of at least $2$) for Site $1$. Thus, Site $1$ provides evidence for the bipartition $P_1 = \\{A,B\\} | \\{C,D,E\\}$.\n\nFor Site $2$, the taxa are partitioned into $\\{A,C\\}$ (state $1$) and $\\{B,D,E\\}$ (state $0$). By the same logic, Site $2$ provides evidence for the bipartition $P_2 = \\{A,C\\} | \\{B,D,E\\}$. A tree containing this bipartition has a score of $1$ for Site $2$, while any other tree will have a score of at least $2$.\n\nThe total parsimony score for a tree $T$ is $S(T) = S_1(T) + S_2(T)$, where $S_i(T)$ is the score for site $i$. The minimum possible total score would be $1+1=2$, which could only be achieved if there exists a tree that contains both bipartitions $P_1$ and $P_2$.\n\nWe must check if $P_1$ and $P_2$ are compatible. Two bipartitions are compatible if they can coexist in the same tree. A formal test for compatibility of two bipartitions $X_1|Y_1$ and $X_2|Y_2$ is that at least one of the four intersections $X_1 \\cap X_2$, $X_1 \\cap Y_2$, $Y_1 \\cap X_2$, or $Y_1 \\cap Y_2$ must be an empty set.\nFor our bipartitions:\n$P_1 = \\{A,B\\} | \\{C,D,E\\}$\n$P_2 = \\{A,C\\} | \\{B,D,E\\}$\nThe intersections are:\n-   $\\{A,B\\} \\cap \\{A,C\\} = \\{A\\}$ (non-empty)\n-   $\\{A,B\\} \\cap \\{B,D,E\\} = \\{B\\}$ (non-empty)\n-   $\\{C,D,E\\} \\cap \\{A,C\\} = \\{C\\}$ (non-empty)\n-   $\\{C,D,E\\} \\cap \\{B,D,E\\} = \\{D,E\\}$ (non-empty)\nSince none of these intersections are empty, the bipartitions $P_1$ and $P_2$ are incompatible. This is a case of phylogenetic conflict. No single tree can simultaneously have a minimal score of $1$ for both sites.\n\nConsequently, the minimum total parsimony score must be greater than $2$. We evaluate the possible scores:\n-   If a tree contains $P_1$, its score is $S_1 = 1$. Since it cannot contain $P_2$, its score for Site $2$ must be $S_2 \\ge 2$. Total score $S \\ge 1+2=3$.\n-   If a tree contains $P_2$, its score is $S_2 = 1$. Since it cannot contain $P_1$, its score for Site $1$ must be $S_1 \\ge 2$. Total score $S \\ge 2+1=3$.\n-   If a tree contains neither $P_1$ nor $P_2$, its scores are $S_1 \\ge 2$ and $S_2 \\ge 2$. Total score $S \\ge 2+2=4$.\nThe minimum achievable total parsimony score is $3$. The MPTs are the trees with a total score of $3$.

An unrooted binary tree on $5$ taxa has $5-3=2$ internal edges, each corresponding to a nontrivial bipartition. One bipartition is fixed as $P_1$. The other must resolve one of the groups in $P_1$.
