Under a strict molecular clock, if all taxa are sampled contemporaneously, the expected number of substitutions per site accumulated from the root to any tip is equal. This is because the instantaneous substitution rate per site, denoted by $r$, is assumed constant through time and across lineages, and branch lengths in such trees represent expected substitutions per site, which are proportional to elapsed time. Therefore, in a rooted tree whose extant tips are contemporaneous, every root-to-tip path length should be equal, up to numerical tolerance.\n\nFundamental base:\n- Under a time-homogeneous Poisson process of substitutions at a constant rate $r$ per site, the expected number of substitutions in an interval of length $t$ is $rt$. In a rooted tree with contemporaneous tips, the elapsed time from the root to each tip is the same, say $T$, so the expected total substitutions along a root-to-tip path is $rT$. Since branch lengths encode expected substitutions per site, the sum of branch lengths along any root-to-tip path should be equal across all tips for a strict molecular clock tree.\n\nDefinitions for this task:\n- A rooted, weighted tree in Newick format defines a set of leaves (tips) with labels, and each edge carries a nonnegative length equal to the expected substitutions per site for that edge.\n- For each leaf $i$, let $L_i$ be the total root-to-tip length, defined as the sum of branch lengths along the unique path from the root to that leaf.\n- Given a nonnegative tolerance $\\epsilon$, the tree is declared ultrametric if $\\max_i L_i - \\min_i L_i \\le \\epsilon$.\n- If the tree is not ultrametric, define the median root-to-tip length $\\tilde{L}$ as the median of $\\{L_i\\}$. The most non-clock-like lineage is the tip whose absolute deviation $|L_i - \\tilde{L}|$ is maximized. In case of a tie, choose the lineage whose label is lexicographically smallest.\n- To make the output machine-checkable without strings, define an index map for leaves as follows: list all leaf labels, sort them lexicographically in ascending order, and assign indices $0,1,2,\\dots$ in that order. Report the index of the most non-clock-like lineage. If the tree is ultrametric, report $-1$ as the lineage index and $0.0$ as the deviation.\n\nYour program must:\n- Parse a rooted Newick tree string with branch lengths into an internal representation. The input strings will be syntactically valid Newick and will always be rooted. You must correctly handle polytomies (nodes with degree greater than $2$), leaves, and internal nodes, each optionally with labels. All branch lengths are nonnegative real numbers, and all leaves have labels.\n- Compute all root-to-tip lengths $\\{L_i\\}$.\n- Decide ultrametricity using the tolerance $\\epsilon$.\n- If not ultrametric, identify the most non-clock-like lineage as defined above and compute its maximum absolute deviation $d^\\star = \\max_i |L_i - \\tilde{L}|$.\n- For each test case, output a triplet $[u,k,d]$, where $u$ is a boolean indicating ultrametricity, $k$ is the integer lineage index as defined above, and $d$ is the float $d^\\star$. If $u$ is true, output $k=-1$ and $d=0.0$. Round $d$ to $6$ decimal places using standard rounding.\n\nAngle units are not applicable. The branch length unit is expected substitutions per site.

Each test case result must itself be a list of the form $[u,k,d]$ as specified. For example, an output with two hypothetical cases would look like $[[\\text{True},-1,0.0],[\\text{False},1,0.123456]]$.", "solution": "The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and objective. It presents a clear computational task based on the molecular clock hypothesis, a fundamental concept in evolutionary biology. All terms, such as Newick format, root-to-tip length, and ultrametricity, are precisely defined. The inputs, expected outputs, and evaluation criteria, including tie-breaking rules, are specified without ambiguity. The problem is therefore valid and a solution can be constructed.\n\nThe solution is implemented by following a sequence of logical steps:\n1.  **Tree Parsing**: The Newick-formatted string, representing a rooted phylogenetic tree, must be parsed into an appropriate in-memory data structure. A recursive descent parsing strategy is employed. The tree is represented using a `Node` class, where each instance stores its name (if any), the length of the branch leading to it, and references to its parent and children. The parser first splits the children of the root and then recursively calls a function to parse each child's subtree string. This handles nested structures and polytomies correctly.\n\n2.  **Root-to-Tip Length Calculation**: Once the tree is parsed, the root-to-tip distance $L_i$ for each leaf $i$ is calculated. This is achieved by a depth-first traversal starting from the root of the tree. The function `_get_root_to_tip_lengths` recursively traverses the tree, accumulating the sum of branch lengths along each path. When a leaf is reached, its name and total path length are stored. The result is a collection of pairs $(name_i, L_i)$ for all leaves in the tree.\n\n3.  **Ultrametricity Test**: The molecular clock hypothesis implies that in a perfectly clock-like tree with contemporaneous tips, all root-to-tip paths should have equal length. This property is known as ultrametricity. To test this, we compute the difference between the maximum and minimum root-to-tip lengths, $\\max_i L_i - \\min_i L_i$. If this difference is less than or equal to the given tolerance $\\epsilon$, the tree is considered ultrametric. In this case, the result is recorded as ultrametric ($u=\\text{True}$), with a lineage index $k=-1$ and deviation $d=0.0$ as per the problem specification.\n\n4.  **Non-ultrametric Analysis**: If the tree fails the ultrametricity test ($\\max_i L_i - \\min_i L_i > \\epsilon$), it is declared non-ultrametric ($u=\\text{False}$). According to the problem definition, we must identify the most non-clock-like lineage. This involves the following steps:\n    a.  Calculate the median root-to-tip length, $\\tilde{L}$, from the set of all $\\{L_i\\}$. The `numpy.median` function is used for this calculation, which correctly handles both odd and even numbers of elements.\n    b.  For each leaf $i$, compute the absolute deviation of its path length from the median: $|L_i - \\tilde{L}|$.\n    c.  The maximum of these deviations, $d^\\star = \\max_i |L_i - \\tilde{L}|$, is identified. This value, rounded to $6$ decimal places using Python's built-in `round()` function, corresponds to the output value $d$.\n    d.  Identify the lineage(s) corresponding to this maximum deviation. If there is a tie (multiple lineages exhibit the same maximum deviation), the problem specifies a tie-breaking rule: select the lineage whose label is lexicographically smallest.\n    e.  Finally, the index $k$ of this identified lineage must be determined. An index map is created by sorting all leaf labels lexicographically and assigning indices $0, 1, 2, \\dots$. The index of the chosen lineage's label in this sorted list is the value $k$.\n\n5.  **Output Generation**: For each test case, a triplet $[u,k,d]$ is generated. These triplets are collected into a list.

The core issue is quantitative and amenable to statistical analysis.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It contains no inconsistencies, missing information, or logical flaws. It is a valid scientific question. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe central issue is the interpretation of a non-linear relationship between an observed measure of genetic distance (the uncorrected $p$-distance) and divergence time. The uncorrected $p$-distance is defined as the proportion of sites at which two sequences differ. We denote it by $p$. The true evolutionary distance, which we will call $d$, is the actual number of substitutions that have occurred per site. A constant rate of evolution (the strict molecular clock hypothesis) implies a linear relationship between the true evolutionary distance and time: $d=rt$, where $r$ is the constant evolutionary rate.\n\nThe observed $p$-distance is a notorious underestimate of the true distance $d$, especially for large $d$. This is because multiple substitutions at the same site are not observed; only the net difference is counted. For example, a site that changes from 'A' to 'G' and then back to 'A' shows no difference, but two substitutions have occurred. This phenomenon is called **substitution saturation**. As time $t$ increases, so does the true distance $d$, and the probability of such multiple hits increases. Consequently, the observed $p$-distance increases more and more slowly and approaches a theoretical maximum, causing the characteristic \"flattening\" of the curve when plotting $p$ versus $t$. For the simplest substitution model, the Jukes-Cantor model, this relationship is given by:\n$$ p(d) = \\frac{3}{4}\\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{4}{3}d}\\right) $$\nAs $d \\to \\infty$, $p \\to \\frac{3}{4}$. This saturation effect can mimic a slowdown in evolution.\n\nThe alternative hypothesis is a **genuine slowdown in evolutionary rate**. This means that for a particular lineage, the rate $r$ is not constant but decreases, or is significantly lower than in other lineages. This would also lead to a flattening of the curve of distance versus time, as less evolutionary distance $d$ accumulates per unit time $\\Delta t$ for older divergences involving that lineage.\n\nA \"principled way\" to distinguish these two phenomena must involve a method that explicitly models and corrects for substitution saturation before testing hypotheses about rate variation.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Fit a straight line to uncorrected $p$-distances versus $t$ using least squares, downweight older nodes with larger $t$, and attribute any remaining curvature to a lineage-specific slowdown.**\n\nThis approach is fundamentally flawed. It begins by assuming a linear relationship for a quantity ($p$-distance) that is known from first principles to be non-linear with time due to saturation. Fitting a straight line is therefore inappropriate. \"Downweighting\" older nodes is an ad-hoc dismissal of the very data that manifest the problem, rather than an attempt to understand it. Attributing residual curvature to a rate slowdown is an invalid inference, because the primary cause of curvature—saturation—has not been correctly accounted for. This methodology is scientifically unsound. **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Use a likelihood-based substitution model that corrects for multiple hits (for example, the General Time Reversible (GTR) model with gamma-distributed rate heterogeneity across sites, denoted $+\\Gamma$), estimate branch lengths in substitutions per site, and then compare a strict molecular clock model (single rate $r$ for all lineages) to a local-clock model that allows a distinct rate $r'$ on the focal lineage using a Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT). In parallel, apply a formal saturation diagnostic on the alignment. Conclude a genuine slowdown only if the local-clock model significantly improves fit after accounting for multiple hits and the alignment does not show strong saturation.**\n\nThis strategy is rigorous and represents the standard of practice in modern phylogenetics.\n1.  **Correction for Multiple Hits**: It employs a sophisticated, likelihood-based substitution model (GTR+$\\Gamma$). The GTR model accounts for different rates among all possible nucleotide substitutions, and the $\\Gamma$ distribution models rate variation across different sites in the alignment. This provides a robust estimate of the true evolutionary distance $d$ (branch lengths in substitutions per site), correcting for multiple hits.\n2.  **Formal Hypothesis Testing**: It then uses these corrected distances within a formal statistical framework. It compares the likelihood of the data under a null model (strict clock, one rate $r$) versus an alternative model (local clock, two rates $r$ and $r'$). The Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) is a powerful, principled statistical test for this model comparison. A significantly better fit of the local-clock model provides statistical evidence for lineage-specific rate variation *after* accounting for saturation.\n3.  **Ancillary Checks**: It includes the sensible step of applying a formal saturation diagnostic. This acknowledges that even advanced models have limitations and that extreme saturation can render any evolutionary inference unreliable.\nThis comprehensive approach directly attacks the problem by first modeling the known artifact (saturation) and then statistically testing the hypothesis of interest (rate variation). This constitutes a proper, principled scientific investigation. **Correct**.\n\n**C. Remove all third-codon-position sites from the alignment, recompute uncorrected $p$-distances versus $t$, and infer saturation if the flattening disappears; otherwise infer a genuine slowdown.**\n\nThis methodology is a blunt instrument. Third codon positions in protein-coding genes are often under weak selective pressure and thus evolve rapidly, making them prone to saturation. Removing them may reduce the overall signal of saturation. If the plot of (the new) $p$-distance versus $t$ becomes linear, it strongly suggests that saturation at third positions was the main cause. However, this method has severe limitations. First, it still relies on uncorrected $p$-distances, which is a poor choice. Second, if the flattening persists after removing third positions, the conclusion of a \"genuine slowdown\" is not secure. The flattening could be due to saturation at the remaining first and second positions, especially over long evolutionary times. This method cannot distinguish between a true slowdown and saturation in the less variable sites. It also discards potentially useful information. A superior approach would be to partition the data by codon position and apply a model like GTR+$\\Gamma$ to each partition separately, as this uses all the data in a more sophisticated manner. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Compute the transitions-to-transversions ratio for each pairwise comparison and declare saturation if the ratio drops below a fixed threshold; otherwise declare a genuine slowdown.**\n\nThis is an incomplete diagnostic, not a comprehensive strategy. The ratio of transitions to transversions (Ts/Tv) is indeed a classic indicator of saturation. Transitions typically occur at a higher rate than transversions but also saturate more quickly. A declining Ts/Tv ratio with increasing genetic distance is a hallmark of saturation. However, this is merely a test *for* saturation. It does not provide any test *for* a lineage-specific slowdown. The logical step \"otherwise declare a genuine slowdown\" is a fallacy—a non-sequitur. The absence of evidence for strong saturation is not evidence for the presence of a rate slowdown. The observed flattening could be due to other biological or stochastic factors not considered. This strategy fails to test the primary alternative hypothesis. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2435869"}, {"introduction": "Having established that evolutionary rates can vary, we move from testing for violations to explicitly modeling them using relaxed molecular clocks.

There are $8$ nodes and $7$ branches.\n\nYour program must:\n- For each test case, simulate one realization of the log-rates $x_{v}$ at all nodes on the tree using the specified parameters $(\\delta, \\sigma^{2}, \\mu_{0})$. The simulation must be reproducible: initialize a pseudo-random number generator with seed $42$ for the first test case and, for test case index $i$ (starting from $0$), use seed $42 + i$.\n- From the simulated data, recover the drift parameter $\\delta$ and the variance parameter $\\sigma^{2}$ by treating the observed data as the set of all parent-child log-rate differences $\\Delta_{e} = x_{c} - x_{p}$ with their corresponding branch durations $t_{e}$ across all branches $e$ in the tree. The recovered values must be the parameters that best explain the simulated differences under the model above, expressed as real numbers.\n\nTest suite:\n- Case $1$: $(\\delta, \\sigma^{2}, \\mu_{0}) = (0.0,\\ 0.2,\\ 0.0)$\n- Case $2$: $(\\delta, \\sigma^{2}, \\mu_{0}) = (-0.3,\\ 0.5,\\ -0.357)$\n- Case $3$: $(\\delta, \\sigma^{2}, \\mu_{0}) = (0.2,\\ 0.01,\\ 0.0)$\n\nOutput specification:\n- For each test case, output the recovered drift and variance as a list $[\\widehat{\\delta}, \\widehat{\\sigma^{2}}]$, with each value rounded to $6$ decimal places.\n- Aggregate the results for all test cases into a single line printed to standard output as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each element is itself a two-element list, for example: $[[a_{1},b_{1}],[a_{2},b_{2}],[a_{3},b_{3}]]$.\n- The final output must be exactly one line with this format and contain no extra characters or whitespace beyond what is necessary for valid comma separation and brackets.\n\nNo external input is provided; all parameters, the tree, and the test suite are fixed in the program. The final answers must be real-valued floats as specified, and no units are required in the output.", "solution": "The user-provided problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the field of computational biology, specifically concerning models of molecular evolution. The problem is well-posed, providing a complete description of a generative model, a fixed dataset structure (a phylogenetic tree), and a clear task: to simulate data from the model and then to recover the model parameters using a statistical estimation procedure derived from first principles. The problem statement is objective, precise, and contains no contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe problem is addressed in two stages: first, the simulation of substitution rate evolution on the provided phylogenetic tree, and second, the estimation of the model's parameters from the simulated data.\n\n**1. Simulation of Rate Evolution**\n\nThe model describes the evolution of the logarithm of the substitution rate, $x_v = \\log r_v$, along the branches of a rooted tree. The evolution follows a geometric Brownian motion with drift. For any branch of duration $t$ connecting a parent node $p$ to a child node $c$, the log-rate at the child, $x_c$, is conditionally dependent on the log-rate at the parent, $x_p$, according to the relation:\n$$\nx_{c} \\mid x_{p} \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(x_{p} + \\delta t,\\ \\sigma^{2} t\\right)\n$$\nHere, $\\delta$ represents the drift in log-rate per unit time, and $\\sigma^2$ is the variance of the diffusion process per unit time. This implies that the value of $x_c$ can be generated by drawing a sample from the specified normal distribution. A random variable $Y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma_{\\text{var}}^2)$ can be expressed as $Y = \\mu + \\sqrt{\\sigma_{\\text{var}}^2} \\cdot Z$, where $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ is a standard normal variate. Applying this to our model, we obtain the generative equation:\n$$\nx_c = (x_p + \\delta t) + \\sqrt{\\sigma^2 t} \\cdot Z = x_p + \\delta t + \\sigma \\sqrt{t} \\cdot Z\n$$\nThe simulation proceeds via a traversal of the tree, starting from the root (node $0$). The initial log-rate at the root is given as $x_{\\text{root}} = x_0 = \\mu_0$. The values of $x_v$ for all other nodes $v$ are computed sequentially. Since the tree structure is fixed and provided as a list of directed edges from parent to child, we can compute the log-rate for each child node once its parent's log-rate is known. The process requires a pseudo-random number generator to sample values for $Z$. For reproducibility, the generator is seeded with $42+i$ for the $i$-th test case (where $i$ is $0$-indexed).\n\nThe specified tree has $8$ nodes (numbered $0$ to $7$) and $7$ branches:\n- $(0, 1, 1.0)$, $(1, 3, 0.7)$, $(1, 4, 0.4)$, $(0, 2, 0.5)$, $(2, 5, 0.6)$, $(5, 6, 0.9)$, $(5, 7, 0.3)$\nThe simulation algorithm is as follows:\n1. For a given test case $(\\delta, \\sigma^2, \\mu_0)$ and seed, initialize the array of log-rates, `x_values`, of size $8$.\n2. Set the root log-rate: `x_values[0]` $= \\mu_0$.\n3. Iterate through the list of branches $(p, c, t)$. For each branch:\n   a. Retrieve the parent's log-rate, $x_p =$ `x_values[p]`.\n   b. Draw a sample $Z$ from $\\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.\n   c. Calculate the child's log-rate: $x_c = x_p + \\delta t + \\sigma \\sqrt{t} \\cdot Z$.\n   d. Store this value: `x_values[c]` $= x_c$.\nAfter processing all $7$ branches, the `x_values` array contains one complete realization of the process on the tree.\n\n**2. Parameter Estimation from Simulated Data**\n\nThe second part of the problem is to recover the parameters $\\delta$ and $\\sigma^2$ from the simulated log-rates $\\{x_v\\}$. The problem specifies that the estimation should be based on the set of parent-child log-rate differences, $\\Delta_e = x_c - x_p$, and their corresponding branch durations, $t_e$.\n\nFrom the generative model, the distribution of this difference is:\n$$\n\\Delta_e = x_c - x_p \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\delta t_e, \\sigma^2 t_e)\n$$\nWe are tasked to find the parameters that best explain the observed data. This is achieved through Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). The draws for each branch are conditionally independent given the parent values. Therefore, the total likelihood of observing the set of all differences $\\{\\Delta_e\\}$ across all $N=7$ branches is the product of the individual probability densities:\n$$\nL(\\delta, \\sigma^2 \\mid \\{\\Delta_e, t_e\\}) = \\prod_{e=1}^{N} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma^2 t_e}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\Delta_e - \\delta t_e)^2}{2\\sigma^2 t_e}\\right)\n$$\nIt is more convenient to maximize the log-likelihood, $\\ell = \\log L$:\n$$\n\\ell(\\delta, \\sigma^2) = \\sum_{e=1}^{N} \\left[ -\\frac{1}{2}\\log(2\\pi) - \\frac{1}{2}\\log(\\sigma^2) - \\frac{1}{2}\\log(t_e) - \\frac{(\\Delta_e - \\delta t_e)^2}{2\\sigma^2 t_e} \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\ell(\\delta, \\sigma^2) = C - \\frac{N}{2}\\log(\\sigma^2) - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} \\sum_{e=1}^{N} \\frac{(\\Delta_e - \\delta t_e)^2}{t_e}\n$$\nwhere $C$ contains terms that do not depend on $\\delta$ or $\\sigma^2$.\n\nTo find the MLE for $\\delta$, denoted $\\widehat{\\delta}$, we take the partial derivative of $\\ell$ with respect to $\\delta$ and set it to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\ell}{\\partial \\delta} = - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} \\sum_{e=1}^{N} \\frac{2(\\Delta_e - \\delta t_e)(-t_e)}{t_e} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} \\sum_{e=1}^{N} (\\Delta_e - \\delta t_e) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{e=1}^{N} \\Delta_e - \\widehat{\\delta} \\sum_{e=1}^{N} t_e = 0 \\implies \\widehat{\\delta} = \\frac{\\sum_{e=1}^{N} \\Delta_e}{\\sum_{e=1}^{N} t_e}\n$$\nThe estimator for $\\delta$ is the total change in log-rate across all branches divided by the total duration of all branches.\n\nTo find the MLE for $\\sigma^2$, denoted $\\widehat{\\sigma^2}$, we take the partial derivative of $\\ell$ with respect to $\\sigma^2$ and set it to zero, substituting $\\widehat{\\delta}$ for $\\delta$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\ell}{\\partial \\sigma^2} = -\\frac{N}{2\\sigma^2} + \\frac{1}{2(\\sigma^2)^2} \\sum_{e=1}^{N} \\frac{(\\Delta_e - \\widehat{\\delta} t_e)^2}{t_e} = 0\n$$\n$$\n-N\\sigma^2 + \\sum_{e=1}^{N} \\frac{(\\Delta_e - \\widehat{\\delta} t_e)^2}{t_e} = 0 \\implies \\widehat{\\sigma^2} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{e=1}^{N} \\frac{(\\Delta_e - \\widehat{\\delta} t_e)^2}{t_e}\n$$\nThis is the sample mean of the squared weighted residuals, where the residual for branch $e$ is $(\\Delta_e - \\widehat{\\delta} t_e)$ and the weight is $1/t_e$.\n\nThe implementation will first perform the simulation to generate the `x_values` for each test case, then apply these derived formulae to compute $\\widehat{\\delta}$ and $\\widehat{\\sigma^2}$ from the simulated data.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates rate evolution on a fixed tree and recovers the model parameters.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the fixed tree structure as a list of (parent, child, time) tuples.\n    # The tree has 8 nodes (0-7) and 7 branches.
