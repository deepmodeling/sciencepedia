A complete solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the evolutionary distance $d$ in terms of the observed proportion of differing sites $p$. This requires establishing a relationship between each of these quantities and the underlying parameters of the JC model, which are the substitution rate parameter $\\alpha$ and the total time $\\tau$.\n\nFirst, we determine the average rate of substitution per site, $\\mu$. By definition, $\\mu = \\sum_{i} \\pi_i (-Q_{ii})$.\nThe problem provides the stationary distribution $\\pi_i = \\frac{1}{4}$ for all $4$ nucleotide states $i \\in \\{A, C, G, T\\}$.\nThe diagonal elements of the rate matrix are given as $Q_{ii} = -3\\alpha$.\nTherefore, the rate $\\mu$ is:\n$$ \\mu = \\sum_{i \\in \\{A,C,G,T\\}} \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) (-(-3\\alpha)) = 4 \\times \\frac{3\\alpha}{4} = 3\\alpha $$\nThe evolutionary distance $d$, defined as the expected number of substitutions per site, is given by $d = \\mu \\tau$. Substituting the expression for $\\mu$, we have:\n$$ d = 3\\alpha\\tau $$\n\nNext, we must find an expression for $p$, the expected fraction of nucleotide differences. For a time-reversible Markov model such as JC, the probability of observing a difference between two sequences separated by a total branch length of $\\tau$ is equivalent to the probability that a single sequence will change its state over a time interval $\\tau$. Let us assume the process starts at equilibrium, meaning the initial nucleotide is drawn from the stationary distribution $\\pi$. The probability of a difference is then the probability of starting in any state $i$ and ending in any other state $j \\neq i$ after time $\\tau$.\n$$ p = \\sum_{i} \\pi_i \\left( \\sum_{j \\neq i} P_{ij}(\\tau) \\right) $$\nDue to the symmetry of the JC model, the probability of changing from state $i$ to any other state is independent of the starting state $i$. That is, $\\sum_{j \\neq i} P_{ij}(\\tau)$ is the same for all $i$. Since $\\sum_i \\pi_i = 1$, the expression for $p$ simplifies to:\n$$ p = \\sum_{j \\neq i} P_{ij}(\\tau) = 1 - P_{ii}(\\tau) $$\nfor any arbitrarily chosen state $i$.\n\nWe must now determine the transition probability $P_{ii}(\\tau)$. The transition matrix $P(t)$ is the solution to the master equation $\\frac{d P(t)}{dt} = P(t) Q_{JC}$ with initial condition $P(0) = I$, the identity matrix. It is simpler to solve for the probability vector. Let $p_k(t)$ be the probability of being in state $k$ at time $t$. Consider a sequence starting in state $i$ at $t=0$. The change in probability of remaining in state $i$ is described by the differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dp_i(t)}{dt} = \\sum_{k} p_k(t) Q_{ki} $$\nUsing the specific entries of the JC matrix, with $p_i(0)=1$ and $p_j(0)=0$ for $j \\neq i$:\n$$ \\frac{dp_i(t)}{dt} = p_i(t) Q_{ii} + \\sum_{j \\neq i} p_j(t) Q_{ji} = p_i(t)(-3\\alpha) + \\sum_{j \\neq i} p_j(t) \\alpha $$\nSince the probabilities must sum to unity, $\\sum_{j \\neq i} p_j(t) = 1 - p_i(t)$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{dp_i(t)}{dt} = -3\\alpha p_i(t) + \\alpha(1 - p_i(t)) = \\alpha - 4\\alpha p_i(t) $$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can solve it using an integrating factor or by separation of variables. Let us rearrange to find the solution:\n$$ \\frac{dp_i}{dt} + 4\\alpha p_i = \\alpha $$\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution, $C \\exp(-4\\alpha t)$, and a particular solution. For the particular solution, we try a constant $p_i = K$, which gives $4\\alpha K = \\alpha$, so $K = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nThe general solution is $p_i(t) = \\frac{1}{4} + C \\exp(-4\\alpha t)$.\nWe apply the initial condition $p_i(0) = 1$:\n$$ 1 = \\frac{1}{4} + C \\exp(0) \\implies C = \\frac{3}{4} $$\nThus, the probability of remaining in the same state after time $t$ is:\n$$ P_{ii}(t) = p_i(t) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{3}{4} \\exp(-4\\alpha t) $$\nNow we can compute $p$ by substituting $t=\\tau$:\n$$ p = 1 - P_{ii}(\\tau) = 1 - \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{3}{4} \\exp(-4\\alpha \\tau) \\right) = \\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{3}{4} \\exp(-4\\alpha \\tau) $$\n$$ p = \\frac{3}{4} \\left( 1 - \\exp(-4\\alpha \\tau) \\right) $$\n\nWe have established two relations:\n1. $d = 3\\alpha \\tau$\n2. $p = \\frac{3}{4} (1 - \\exp(-4\\alpha \\tau))$\n\nOur goal is to express $d$ as a function of $p$. From equation (1), we have $\\alpha \\tau = \\frac{d}{3}$. We can substitute this into equation (2):\n$$ p = \\frac{3}{4} \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left(-4 \\left(\\frac{d}{3}\\right)\\right) \\right) = \\frac{3}{4} \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{4d}{3}\\right) \\right) $$\nNow, we must invert this expression to solve for $d$.\n$$ \\frac{4p}{3} = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{4d}{3}\\right) $$\n$$ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{4d}{3}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{4p}{3} $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ -\\frac{4d}{3} = \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{4p}{3}\\right) $$\nFinally, solving for $d$:\n$$ d = -\\frac{3}{4} \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{4p}{3}\\right) $$\nThis is the Jukes-Cantor distance formula, which corrects the observed proportion of differences $p$ to estimate the actual number of substitutions that have occurred per site. Note that the argument of the logarithm requires $1 - \\frac{4p}{3} > 0$, which implies $p  \\frac{3}{4}$. This is expected, as at infinite time ($\\tau \\to \\infty$), the probability of any nucleotide at a site becomes $\\frac{1}{4}$, so the probability of a mismatch $p$ approaches $\\frac{3}{4}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-\\frac{3}{4} \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{4p}{3}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2407121"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple distance metrics, modern phylogenetics often relies on the powerful framework of maximum likelihood.

A model is time-reversible if the rate of flux from state $i$ to state $j$ equals the rate of flux from $j$ to $i$ under stationarity.

It presents a standard, calculable scenario in molecular evolution using the Jukes-Cantor model, with all necessary information provided and no internal contradictions or scientific flaws.\n\nThe Jukes-Cantor $1969$ (JC69) model is a model of nucleotide substitution that assumes equal base frequencies (i.e., $\\pi_A = \\pi_C = \\pi_G = \\pi_T = 1/4$) and equal substitution rates between any pair of distinct nucleotides.\n\nUnder this model, the probability $p$ of observing a difference at a single nucleotide site between two sequences that have diverged for a time corresponding to an evolutionary distance $d$ is given by the formula:\n$$ p(d) = \\frac{3}{4} \\left( 1 - e^{-\\frac{4}{3}d} \\right) $$\nHere, the distance $d$ is defined as the expected number of substitutions per site that have occurred along the two lineages since their divergence from a common ancestor.\n\nThe problem provides an observed proportion of differences, $\\hat{p} = 0.75$, based on a Hamming distance of $75$ sites in sequences of length $100$. To estimate the evolutionary distance, $\\hat{d}$, we must invert the JC69 formula, treating the observed proportion $\\hat{p}$ as an estimate of the true probability $p$:\n$$ \\hat{d} = -\\frac{3}{4} \\ln \\left( 1 - \\frac{4}{3}\\hat{p} \\right) $$\nThis is the JC69 distance correction formula.\n\nWe substitute the given value $\\hat{p} = 0.75$ into this equation:\n$$ \\hat{d} = -\\frac{3}{4} \\ln \\left( 1 - \\frac{4}{3} \\times 0.75 \\right) $$\nRecognizing that $0.75$ is equal to $3/4$:\n$$ \\hat{d} = -\\frac{3}{4} \\ln \\left( 1 - \\frac{4}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{4} \\right) $$\n$$ \\hat{d} = -\\frac{3}{4} \\ln (1 - 1) $$\n$$ \\hat{d} = -\\frac{3}{4} \\ln(0) $$\nThe natural logarithm function, $\\ln(x)$, approaches $-\\infty$ as its argument $x$ approaches $0$ from the positive side.

First, the JC69 model assumes *equal* base frequencies, so the premise is false. The infinite distance is a feature of the model reaching its saturation limit, not a result of violating its assumptions. Second, there is no guarantee that a more complex GTR model would yield a small, finite distance; if the sequences are genuinely very divergent, a GTR model would also estimate a very large distance.
