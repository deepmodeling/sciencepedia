The last common ancestor of primates and rodents possessed a single ancestral gene for this receptor, which we will call `AncReceptor`.

Analogs", "solution": "To solve this problem, we must understand and apply the precise definitions of different types of homologous relationships between genes.\n\nFirst, let's define the key terms:\n- **Homologs**: Genes that are related by descent from a common ancestral gene. This is the broadest category. If two genes are orthologs or paralogs, they are also homologs.\n- **Orthologs**: Homologous genes found in different species that diverged from a common ancestral gene as a result of a speciation event. They typically retain the same function in the different species.\n- **Paralogs**: Homologous genes within the same species that arose from a gene duplication event. After duplication, the two copies are free to evolve independently, often leading to new, though related, functions.\n- **Xenologs**: Homologous genes that are related via horizontal gene transfer between two species. This is not relevant to the scenario described.\n- **Analogs**: Genes or proteins that have the same or similar function but do not share a common evolutionary origin. They are a product of convergent evolution, not divergent evolution.\n\nNow, let's analyze the evolutionary scenario described in the problem:\n1.  There was a common ancestral gene, `AncReceptor`, in the ancestor of primates and rodents.\n2.  A speciation event occurred, splitting the primate and rodent lineages. At this point, both lineages inherited a copy of `AncReceptor`.\n3.  In the rodent lineage, this gene evolved into `mReceptor` in mice.\n4.  In the primate lineage, this gene first underwent a duplication event, creating two copies. These two copies then evolved into `hReceptor-A` and `hReceptor-B` in humans.\n\nWe are asked for the relationship between the mouse gene `mReceptor` and the human gene `hReceptor-A`.\n\nLet's trace their ancestry back. The divergence between the lineage leading to `mReceptor` and the lineage leading to `hReceptor-A` was initiated by the speciation event that separated primates and rodents. Genes in different species whose most recent common ancestor coincided with a speciation event are, by definition, orthologs.\n\nLet's consider the other relationships for completeness:\n- The relationship between `hReceptor-A` and `hReceptor-B` is that of **paralogs**, because they arose from a duplication event within the primate lineage.\n- The relationship between `mReceptor` and both `hReceptor-A` and `hReceptor-B` is homologous, since they all share the `AncReceptor` as a common ancestor. However, the term \"homolog\" is less specific than \"ortholog\".

Paralogs: Incorrect. This describes the relationship between `hReceptor-A` and `hReceptor-B`.\nB. Orthologs: Correct. The divergence between `mReceptor` and `hReceptor-A` is due to a speciation event.\nC. Homologs: True, but not the most specific term.

Therefore, the problem is **valid**. I will proceed with deriving the solution.\n\nThe problem requires reconciling the given gene tree, $G = \\left(\\left(\\mathrm{A_1},\\,\\mathrm{B_1}\\right),\\,\\mathrm{A_2}\\right)$, with the species tree, $S = \\left(\\mathrm{A},\\,\\mathrm{B}\\right)$. We use the principle of minimizing duplications and losses. The standard method for this is the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) mapping.\n\nLet $L(g)$ be the species to which a gene leaf $g$ belongs.\n$L(\\mathrm{A_1}) = \\mathrm{A}$\n$L(\\mathrm{B_1}) = \\mathrm{B}$\n$L(\\mathrm{A_2}) = \\mathrm{A}$\n\nLet $M(n)$ be the set of species represented in the subtree rooted at a node $n$ in the gene tree. Let $\\mathrm{LCA}_S(M(n))$ be the lowest common ancestor of the species in $M(n)$ within the species tree $S$.\n\nWe analyze the internal nodes of the gene tree $G$ from the tips towards the root.\n\n1.  Consider the internal node $u_1$ which is the parent of $\\mathrm{A_1}$ and $\\mathrm{B_1}$.\n    -   The species set for its children is $M(u_1) = \\{L(\\mathrm{A_1}), L(\\mathrm{B_1})\\} = \\{\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{B}\\}$.\n    -   The LCA of this set in the species tree is $\\mathrm{LCA}_S(\\{\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{B}\\}) = \\mathrm{ancestor}(\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{B})$.\n    -   To determine if the event at $u_1$ is a speciation or duplication, we examine the species sets of its children subtrees: $M(\\mathrm{A_1}) = \\{\\mathrm{A}\\}$ and $M(\\mathrm{B_1}) = \\{\\mathrm{B}\\}$.\n    -   Since $M(\\mathrm{A_1}) \\cap M(\\mathrm{B_1}) = \\emptyset$, the evolutionary event at node $u_1$ is a **speciation event**. This event corresponds to the divergence of $\\mathrm{Species\\ A}$ and $\\mathrm{Species\\ B}$. Thus, $\\mathrm{A_1}$ and $\\mathrm{B_1}$ are orthologs.\n\n2.  Consider the root node $u_2$ of the gene tree, which is the parent of node $u_1$ and leaf $\\mathrm{A_2}$.\n    -   The species set for the subtree rooted at $u_2$ is $M(u_2) = M(u_1) \\cup M(\\mathrm{A_2}) = \\{\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{B}\\} \\cup \\{\\mathrm{A}\\} = \\{\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{B}\\}$.\n    -   The LCA of this set in the species tree is $\\mathrm{LCA}_S(\\{\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{B}\\}) = \\mathrm{ancestor}(\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{B})$.\n    -   To determine the event type, we examine the species sets of its children subtrees: $M(u_1) = \\{\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{B}\\}$ and $M(\\mathrm{A_2}) = \\{\\mathrm{A}\\}$.\n    -   We compute the intersection: $M(u_1) \\cap M(\\mathrm{A_2}) = \\{\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{B}\\} \\cap \\{\\mathrm{A}\\} = \\{\\mathrm{A}\\}$.\n    -   Since the intersection is not empty, the evolutionary event at node $u_2$ must be a **gene duplication event**. This duplication occurred in the ancestral species $\\mathrm{LCA}_S(M(u_2)) = \\mathrm{ancestor}(\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{B})$.\n\n3.  Reconstruction of the evolutionary history:\n    -   A gene duplication occurred in the common ancestor of $\\mathrm{Species\\ A}$ and $\\mathrm{Species\\ B}$. This created two paralogous gene lineages, let us call them lineage $\\alpha$ (ancestor of $\\mathrm{A_2}$) and lineage $\\beta$ (ancestor of the $(\\mathrm{A_1}, \\mathrm{B_1})$ clade).\n    -   The speciation event separating $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$ occurs. Both species inherit both gene lineages, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n    -   In the lineage leading to $\\mathrm{Species\\ A}$, lineage $\\alpha$ evolves into $\\mathrm{A_2}$ and lineage $\\beta$ evolves into $\\mathrm{A_1}$.\n    -   In the lineage leading to $\\mathrm{Species\\ B}$, lineage $\\beta$ evolves into $\\mathrm{B_1}$. Lineage $\\alpha$, however, has no descendant in $\\mathrm{Species\\ B}$. Since sampling is complete, this means the $\\alpha$ lineage was **lost** in the lineage leading to $\\mathrm{Species\\ B}$.\n\nThis evolutionary history requires $1$ duplication event and $1$ gene loss event. This is the most parsimonious scenario under the Duplication-Loss model. The relationship between the genes is as follows: $\\mathrm{A_1}$ and $\\mathrm{B_1}$ are orthologs. $\\mathrm{A_1}$ and $\\mathrm{A_2}$ are paralogs (specifically, in-paralogs). $\\mathrm{B_1}$ and $\\mathrm{A_2}$ are also paralogs (specifically, out-paralogs, as their divergence predates the speciation of $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$).\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. A single gene duplication occurred in the common ancestor of $\\mathrm{Species\\ A}$ and $\\mathrm{Species\\ B}$ before their divergence, producing two paralogous copies; subsequently, the lineage leading to $\\mathrm{Species\\ B}$ lost the copy corresponding to $\\mathrm{SpeciesA\\_gene2}$, leaving $\\mathrm{SpeciesB\\_gene1}$ as the ortholog of $\\mathrm{SpeciesA\\_gene1}$.**\nThis option perfectly matches the derived history: a duplication in the common ancestor, followed by a loss in the $\\mathrm{B}$ lineage of one paralog, and the orthologous relationship between $\\mathrm{A_1}$ and $\\mathrm{B_1}$ arising from the other paralog. The cost is $1$ duplication and $1$ loss. This is the most parsimonious, consistent explanation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. A single gene duplication occurred only in the lineage leading to $\\mathrm{Species\\ A}$ after its divergence from $\\mathrm{Species\\ B}$, and no gene loss occurred.**\nIf this were the case, the speciation event would happen first. Then, in the $\\mathrm{A}$ lineage, a duplication would create $\\mathrm{A_1}$ and $\\mathrm{A_2}$. These two genes would be each other's closest relatives. The gene from $\\mathrm{B}$ would be an outgroup to this pair. The resulting gene tree topology would be $\\left(\\left(\\mathrm{A_1}, \\mathrm{A_2}\\right), \\mathrm{B_1}\\right)$. This contradicts the given gene tree $\\left(\\left(\\mathrm{A_1}, \\mathrm{B_1}\\right), \\mathrm{A_2}\\right)$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Incomplete Lineage Sorting (ILS) without any gene duplication or loss can generate the observed topology by deep coalescence alone.**\nIncomplete Lineage Sorting (ILS) describes the discordance between gene trees and species trees due to the persistence of ancestral polymorphisms across speciation events. ILS operates on alleles of a single locus. The presence of two distinct homologous genes, $\\mathrm{A_1}$ and $\\mathrm{A_2}$, within the genome of a single individual of $\\mathrm{Species\\ A}$ is, by definition, the result of a gene duplication. ILS cannot, by itself, create new gene copies. The premise \"without any gene duplication\" is fundamentally inconsistent with the data.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) from $\\mathrm{Species\\ A}$ to $\\mathrm{Species\\ B}$ of the copy corresponding to $\\mathrm{SpeciesA\\_gene1}$, following a duplication in $\\mathrm{Species\\ A}$ after speciation, with replacement of the native copy in $\\mathrm{Species\\ B}$.**\nWhile this complex scenario could potentially explain the gene tree topology, it directly violates one of the fundamental constraints given in the problem statement: \"Assume that the gene is nuclear (so **no Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) is allowed**)\". Any scenario involving HGT is therefore invalid by the problem's own rules.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Convergent evolution caused $\\mathrm{SpeciesA\\_gene1}$ and $\\mathrm{SpeciesB\\_gene1}$ to appear closely related in the inferred tree without any duplication or loss.**\nThe problem states to \"Assume that the gene tree is **correctly inferred**\". A correctly inferred phylogenetic tree is assumed to reflect the true history of vertical descent. Attributing the topology to convergence is to claim the tree is not a correct representation of historical relationships, which contradicts this assumption. Furthermore, like option C, this scenario invokes \"without any duplication\", which fails to explain the existence of two gene copies ($\\mathrm{A_1}$, $\\mathrm{A_2}$) in $\\mathrm{Species\\ A}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis, only option A provides a valid and parsimonious explanation consistent with all given information and constraints.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2398669"}, {"introduction": "While phylogenetic reconciliation is the gold standard, large-scale genomic analyses often employ faster, heuristic methods.

This critical thinking exercise will deepen your understanding of the relationship between sequence similarity and true evolutionary history, highlighting the importance of choosing the right tool for the analytical job.", "problem": "A heuristic frequently used to infer orthology across species pairs is the Reciprocal Best Hit (RBH), which declares two genes as putative orthologs if each is the other’s highest-scoring hit in cross-species sequence similarity searches (e.g., Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) bit-scores). Starting from the core definitions that orthologs are genes related by speciation and paralogs are genes related by duplication, and the well-tested observation that sequence similarity typically decays with evolutionary distance under standard substitution models, consider the following explicit scenario.\n\nAn ancestral gene $G$ duplicated at time $t_d$ shortly before a speciation event at time $t_s$, with $t_d < t_s$ and $t_s - t_d$ small. The duplication produced two copies, $G_\\alpha$ and $G_\\beta$. After speciation, lineage $S_X$ experienced asymmetric loss, retaining only $G_\\alpha$ (now $x_1$), whereas lineage $S_Y$ retained both copies, $G_\\alpha$ (now $y_1$) and $G_\\beta$ (now $y_2$). Due to subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization, the rate on the $S_Y$ branch for $y_1$ accelerated, with $r_{y_1} \\approx 2r$, while $y_2$ remained more conserved with $r_{y_2} \\approx r$.

RBH will call $x_1 \\leftrightarrow y_2$ as orthologs because they are reciprocal best hits ($210$ both ways). This is a failure: the duplication predates speciation ($t_d < t_s$), so $x_1$ and $y_2$ are out-paralogs, while $x_1$ is co-orthologous to both $y_1$ and $y_2$. A robust fix is to infer a gene tree and reconcile it with the species tree to date the duplication relative to $t_s$, optionally integrating conserved synteny, and then assign many-to-many orthology (co-orthologs) rather than relying on RBH.\n\nB. RBH will correctly call $x_1 \\leftrightarrow y_1$ as orthologs because true orthologs necessarily have the highest BLAST bit-scores; duplication and rate variation cannot overturn this ordering.\n\nC.

The definitions of orthologs and paralogs are standard. The evolutionary scenario described (pre-speciation duplication, differential gene loss, and asymmetric evolutionary rates) is a classic and realistic situation that complicates orthology inference. The RBH method is a widely used, real-world heuristic. The assumed inverse relationship between evolutionary distance and sequence similarity score is fundamental to sequence comparison. The setup is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear scenario with all necessary data and asks for an analysis of a specific method (RBH), an evaluation of the result, and an assessment of potential remedies. A unique, meaningful conclusion can be derived from the premises.\n3.  **Objective**: The language is precise and quantitative. The scenario is described objectively without subjective or opinion-based statements.\n4.  **Completeness**: The problem is self-contained. All information required to apply the RBH rule, determine the true evolutionary relationships, and evaluate the options is provided.\n5.  **Consistency**: There are no internal contradictions in the provided data or scenario. The BLAST scores are consistent with the described rate asymmetry: the faster-evolving $y_1$ has a lower similarity score with $x_1$ than the more conserved $y_2$ does.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It represents a canonical example illustrating a known failure mode of similarity-based orthology inference methods. A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution requires three steps: (1) apply the RBH heuristic to the given data; (2) determine the true evolutionary relationships from the problem description and evaluate if the RBH result is correct; (3) assess the proposed remedies in each option.\n\n**1. Application of the RBH Heuristic**\nThe RBH rule states that two genes are orthologs if they are each other's best hit in a reciprocal search.\n- **Search from $S_X$ to $S_Y$**: We compare the BLAST scores of gene $x_1$ against the genes in species $S_Y$. The scores are $B(x_1, y_1) = 160$ and $B(x_1, y_2) = 210$. Since $210 > 160$, the best hit for $x_1$ in species $S_Y$ is $y_2$.\n- **Search from $S_Y$ to $S_X$**: We find the best hits for $y_1$ and $y_2$ in species $S_X$. The only gene available for comparison in $S_X$ is $x_1$.\n    - The best hit for $y_1$ in $S_X$ is $x_1$, with score $B(y_1, x_1) = 160$.\n    - The best hit for $y_2$ in $S_X$ is $x_1$, with score $B(y_2, x_1) = 210$.\n- **Check for Reciprocity**:\n    - The pair ($x_1, y_1$) is not an RBH pair because the best hit for $x_1$ is $y_2$, not $y_1$.\n    - The pair ($x_1, y_2$) is an RBH pair. The best hit for $x_1$ is $y_2$, and the best hit for $y_2$ is $x_1$.\n\nTherefore, the RBH procedure will conclude that $x_1$ and $y_2$ are putative orthologs.\n\n**2. True Evolutionary Relationships and Evaluation of RBH Result**\nThe problem states that the duplication of gene $G$ into $G_\\alpha$ and $G_\\beta$ occurred at time $t_d$, before the speciation event at $t_s$.\n- The lineage leading to $x_1$ in species $S_X$ descends from $G_\\alpha$.\n- The lineage leading to $y_1$ in species $S_Y$ also descends from $G_\\alpha$.\n- The lineage leading to $y_2$ in species $S_Y$ descends from $G_\\beta$.\n\nBy definition:\n- **Orthologs** are genes whose last common ancestor existed at a speciation event. The last common ancestor of $x_1$ and $y_1$ is the gene $G_\\alpha$ just before the speciation at $t_s$. Thus, **$x_1$ and $y_1$ are orthologs**.\n- **Paralogs** are genes whose last common ancestor existed at a duplication event. The last common ancestor of $x_1$ and $y_2$ is the gene $G$ just before the duplication at $t_d$. The event that separated their ancestral lineages is the duplication. Thus, **$x_1$ and $y_2$ are paralogs**. Because the duplication ($t_d$) predates the speciation event ($t_s$) separating species $S_X$ and $S_Y$, they are specifically referred to as **out-paralogs**.\n\nConclusion: RBH incorrectly identifies the out-paralog pair ($x_1, y_2$) as orthologs, and fails to identify the true ortholog pair ($x_1, y_1$). This failure is a direct consequence of the asymmetric rates of evolution. The true ortholog, $y_1$, has evolved more rapidly ($r_{y_1} \\approx 2r$), accumulating more mutations and thus appearing less similar to $x_1$ than the more slowly evolving out-paralog, $y_2$.\n\n**3. Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. RBH will call $x_1 \\leftrightarrow y_2$ as orthologs because they are reciprocal best hits ($210$ both ways). This is a failure: the duplication predates speciation ($t_d < t_s$), so $x_1$ and $y_2$ are out-paralogs, while $x_1$ is co-orthologous to both $y_1$ and $y_2$. A robust fix is to infer a gene tree and reconcile it with the species tree to date the duplication relative to $t_s$, optionally integrating conserved synteny, and then assign many-to-many orthology (co-orthologs) rather than relying on RBH.**\n- The initial statement about the RBH result is correct, as derived above.\n- The diagnosis of this result as a failure is correct. The reason given—that $x_1$ and $y_2$ are out-paralogs because the duplication predates speciation—is the correct evolutionary explanation. The term \"co-orthologous\" is used here to describe the relationship between gene $x_1$ and the set $\\{y_1, y_2\\}$, which form an orthology group; this is acceptable terminology in the field.\n- The proposed remedy—inferring a gene tree and reconciling it with the species tree—is the gold-standard phylogenetic method for distinguishing orthologs from paralogs. This method correctly uses topology to establish the relative timing of duplication and speciation events, which is robust to rate heterogeneity. The mention of synteny is also a valid and powerful complementary approach.\n- The final conclusion to assign many-to-many orthology is the correct outcome of a proper phylogenetic analysis.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. RBH will correctly call $x_1 \\leftrightarrow y_1$ as orthologs because true orthologs necessarily have the highest BLAST bit-scores; duplication and rate variation cannot overturn this ordering.**\n- This option incorrectly states the result of the RBH procedure on the given data. RBH calls $x_1 \\leftrightarrow y_2$, not $x_1 \\leftrightarrow y_1$.\n- The assertion that \"true orthologs necessarily have the highest BLAST bit-scores\" is a false premise. The entire problem is constructed to demonstrate a scenario where this assertion fails due to asymmetric evolutionary rates.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. RBH will fail here, but the failure can be eliminated by imposing a stringent percent identity cutoff (e.g., $> 90\\%$) on top of RBH, which guarantees that the highest-scoring pair represents true orthologs.**\n- This option correctly states that RBH fails.\n- However, the proposed fix is inadequate. A similarity or identity cutoff is a filter, not a tool for resolving relative relationships. The problem is that the *wrong* pair has the *highest* score. A cutoff high enough to filter out the ($x_1, y_2$) pair would, by necessity, also filter out the less similar ($x_1, y_1$) pair. A cutoff low enough to include ($x_1, y_1$) would also include ($x_1, y_2$), and RBH would still select the latter. A cutoff provides no guarantee of orthology and does not fix the issue of rate heterogeneity.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. RBH will fail here, but switching to Reciprocal Smallest Distance (RSD), defined as picking the pair with the smallest model-corrected evolutionary distance in both directions, guarantees recovery of $x_1 \\leftrightarrow y_1$ without needing phylogenetic analysis, because distance correction automatically accounts for pre- versus post-speciation duplications.**\n- This option correctly states that RBH fails.\n- The proposed switch to Reciprocal Smallest Distance (RSD) does not solve the fundamental problem. Evolutionary distance is a product of rate and time ($d=rt$). The true ortholog $y_1$ has a higher rate of evolution ($r_{y_1} \\approx 2r$). Even with a perfect model to correct for multiple substitutions, the resulting distance estimate for the ($x_1, y_1$) pair will be larger than for the ($x_1, y_2$) pair, simply because more substitutions have occurred. RSD, like RBH, would therefore incorrectly select the out-paralog pair ($x_1, y_2$).\n- The claim that distance correction \"automatically accounts for pre- versus post-speciation duplications\" is false. Such models correct for saturation of substitutions; they do not reconstruct evolutionary events like duplication and speciation. That is the express purpose of phylogenetic tree reconciliation.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on this analysis, Option A is the only one that correctly identifies the RBH result, accurately diagnoses the reason for its failure, and proposes the scientifically sound and standard methodology to resolve the issue.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2834914"}]}
