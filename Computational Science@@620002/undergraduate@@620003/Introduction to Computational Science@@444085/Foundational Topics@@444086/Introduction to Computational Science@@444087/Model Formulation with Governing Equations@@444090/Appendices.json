The fin is made of a material with constant thermal conductivity $k$ and exchanges heat with the surrounding fluid by convection with a spatially uniform heat transfer coefficient $h$.

The problem is self-contained, consistent, and well-posed.\n\nThe derivation of the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) begins with the principle of conservation of energy applied to a differential element of the fin of length $dx$ located at an axial position $x$. The fin is at steady-state, has no internal heat generation, and exchanges heat only by conduction along its axis and convection from its surface.\n\nThe energy balance for the differential element is:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of heat conduction into element at } x = \\text{Rate of heat conduction out of element at } x+dx + \\text{Rate of heat convection from element surface}\n$$\nIn symbolic form, this is written as:\n$$\nq_{x} = q_{x+dx} + dq_{\\text{conv}}\n$$\nwhere $q_{x}$ is the rate of heat conduction at position $x$.\n\nWe can express $q_{x+dx}$ using a Taylor series expansion around $x$:\n$$\nq_{x+dx} = q_{x} + \\frac{dq_{x}}{dx}dx + \\mathcal{O}(dx^2)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the energy balance and neglecting higher-order terms, we get:\n$$\nq_{x} = q_{x} + \\frac{dq_{x}}{dx}dx + dq_{\\text{conv}}\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{dq_{x}}{dx}dx + dq_{\\text{conv}} = 0\n$$\nTo proceed, we invoke two physical laws. First, Fourier's law of conduction states that the heat flow rate is proportional to the negative temperature gradient and the cross-sectional area $A(x)$:\n$$\nq_{x} = -k A(x) \\frac{dT}{dx}\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the thermal conductivity and $T(x)$ is the temperature.\n\nSecond, Newton's law of cooling describes the convective heat loss from the surface. For the differential element, the surface area for convection is $dA_{s} = P(x)dx$, where $P(x)$ is the convecting perimeter. The heat loss is:\n$$\ndq_{\\text{conv}} = h dA_{s} (T(x) - T_{\\infty}) = h P(x) (T(x) - T_{\\infty}) dx\n$$\nwhere $h$ is the heat transfer coefficient and $T_{\\infty}$ is the ambient fluid temperature.\n\nSubstituting these two laws into the simplified energy balance equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(-k A(x) \\frac{dT}{dx}\\right)dx + h P(x) (T(x) - T_{\\infty}) dx = 0\n$$\nDividing by $dx$ and noting that the thermal conductivity $k$ is constant, we obtain the general one-dimensional steady-state fin equation for variable cross-sectional area and perimeter:\n$$\n-k \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(A(x) \\frac{dT}{dx}\\right) + h P(x) (T(x) - T_{\\infty}) = 0\n$$\nIt is conventional to define an excess temperature variable $\\theta(x) = T(x) - T_{\\infty}$. With this substitution, $\\frac{d\\theta}{dx} = \\frac{dT}{dx}$, and the ODE becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(A(x) \\frac{d\\theta}{dx}\\right) - \\frac{h P(x)}{k} \\theta(x) = 0\n$$\nThis is the required governing ODE. The problem asks for the coefficient $m^2(x)$ that multiplies the convective sink term. This term is typically identified by rewriting the equation in a standard form, for instance by dividing by $A(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{A(x)}\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(A(x) \\frac{d\\theta}{dx}\\right) - \\frac{h P(x)}{k A(x)} \\theta(x) = 0\n$$\nThe second term, $-\\frac{h P(x)}{k A(x)} \\theta(x)$, represents the convective heat sink. The spatially varying coefficient $m^2(x)$ is therefore defined as:\n$$\nm^{2}(x) = \\frac{h P(x)}{k A(x)}\n$$\nNow, we must specialize this result for the given linearly tapered circular fin. The diameter of the fin at position $x$ is given by:\n$$\nd(x) = d_{0} - \\left(d_{0} - d_{L}\\right)\\frac{x}{L}\n$$\nFor a circular cross-section, the convecting perimeter $P(x)$ and the cross-sectional area $A(x)$ are given by:\n$$\nP(x) = \\pi d(x)\n$$\n$$\nA(x) = \\frac{\\pi}{4} [d(x)]^{2}\n$$\nWe can now compute the ratio $P(x)/A(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{P(x)}{A(x)} = \\frac{\\pi d(x)}{\\frac{\\pi}{4} [d(x)]^{2}} = \\frac{4}{d(x)}\n$$\nSubstituting this ratio into the expression for $m^2(x)$:\n$$\nm^{2}(x) = \\frac{h}{k} \\left(\\frac{P(x)}{A(x)}\\right) = \\frac{h}{k} \\frac{4}{d(x)} = \\frac{4h}{k d(x)}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute the given expression for $d(x)$:\n$$\nm^{2}(x) = \\frac{4h}{k \\left(d_{0} - \\left(d_{0} - d_{L}\\right)\\frac{x}{L}\\right)}\n$$\nTo write this as a single fraction, we can find a common denominator for the term in the parenthesis:\n$$\nd_{0} - \\left(d_{0} - d_{L}\\right)\\frac{x}{L} = \\frac{d_{0}L}{L} - \\frac{(d_{0} - d_{L})x}{L} = \\frac{d_{0}L - d_{0}x + d_{L}x}{L} = \\frac{d_{0}(L-x) + d_{L}x}{L}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $m^2(x)$ yields the final result:\n$$\nm^{2}(x) = \\frac{4h}{k \\left(\\frac{d_{0}(L-x) + d_{L}x}{L}\\right)} = \\frac{4hL}{k(d_{0}(L-x) + d_{L}x)}\n$$\nThis expression for $m^{2}(x)$ is entirely in terms of the specified parameters $h$, $k$, $d_{0}$, $d_{L}$, $L$, and the variable $x$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{4hL}{k\\left(d_{0}(L-x) + d_{L}x\\right)}}\n$$", "id": "3161173"}, {"introduction": "Once a governing equation is formulated, the next step is often to analyze it to understand the interplay of the physical processes involved.

The advective transport scale is $\\sim Uc$, while the diffusive transport scale is $\\sim Dc/L$. Transport rate has units of [mass]/[time], so the flux scales are $U_c$ and $D c/L$.

This value is of order one ($\\mathrm{Da} \\sim O(1)$). This signifies that the characteristic time scale of the reaction ($1/\\lambda = 1/(2.0 \\times 10^{-4}) = 5000$ s) is comparable to the characteristic time scale of advection ($L/U = 1200/0.45 \\approx 2667$ s). Because the rates are comparable, the first-order decay is a significant process over the reach length $L$ and cannot be neglected.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the magnitudes of the dimensionless numbers, the physical process that can be neglected to obtain a leading-order model is longitudinal diffusion.\n\nAs per the answer specification, the final answer must be the ordered pair $(\\mathrm{Pe}, \\mathrm{Da})$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 4.50 \\times 10^{3} & 0.533 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3161229"}, {"introduction": "Real-world systems often involve not just passive physical processes but also active feedback control.

Energy balance: $C \\,\\partial_t T = -k \\,(T - T_0) + u(t)$\n2.  Integral control law: $\\dot{u}(t) = -\\alpha \\,(T(t) - T_{\\text{set}})$\n\nThe state of the system at any time $t$ is fully described by the temperature $T(t)$ and the control input $u(t)$. We are asked to formulate the model in terms of the temperature error, defined as $e(t) = T(t) - T_{\\text{set}}$. The time derivative of the error is $\\dot{e}(t) = \\dot{T}(t)$.\n\nLet us substitute $T(t) = e(t) + T_{\\text{set}}$ into the governing equations.\n\nFirst, the energy balance equation:\n$$ C \\dot{e}(t) = -k((e(t) + T_{\\text{set}}) - T_0) + u(t) $$\nDividing by the heat capacity $C$ (which is a positive constant), we get the equation for $\\dot{e}(t)$:\n$$ \\dot{e}(t) = -\\frac{k}{C} e(t) + \\frac{1}{C} u(t) - \\frac{k}{C}(T_{\\text{set}} - T_0) $$\n\nSecond, the control law equation:\n$$ \\dot{u}(t) = -\\alpha ((e(t) + T_{\\text{set}}) - T_{\\text{set}}) $$\n$$ \\dot{u}(t) = -\\alpha e(t) $$\n\nWe choose the state vector to be $x(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} e(t) \\\\ u(t) \\end{pmatrix}$. The system of equations can now be written in matrix form:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\begin{pmatrix} e(t) \\\\ u(t) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -k/C & 1/C \\\\ -\\alpha & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} e(t) \\\\ u(t) \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} -k(T_{\\text{set}} - T_0)/C \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThis corresponds to the linear time-invariant (LTI) state-space form $\\dot{x} = A x + b$, where:\n- The state vector is $x = \\begin{pmatrix} e \\\\ u \\end{pmatrix}$.\n- The state matrix $A$ is $A = \\begin{pmatrix} -k/C & 1/C \\\\ -\\alpha & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n- The constant input vector $b$ is $b = \\begin{pmatrix} -k(T_{\\text{set}} - T_0)/C \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n### Part 2: Stability Analysis\n\nThe stability of an LTI system concerns the behavior of its state trajectories near an equilibrium point. An equilibrium point, $x_{\\text{eq}}$, is a state where the system remains indefinitely if placed there, i.e., $\\dot{x} = 0$. For the system $\\dot{x} = Ax + b$, the equilibrium point satisfies:\n$$ 0 = A x_{\\text{eq}} + b \\implies x_{\\text{eq}} = -A^{-1} b \\quad (\\text{if } A \\text{ is invertible}) $$\nThe vector $b$ determines the location of this equilibrium point in the state space. Specifically, at equilibrium, $\\dot{u}=0$, which implies $e=0$, so $T=T_{\\text{set}}$. Then $\\dot{T}=0$ implies $u_{\\text{eq}} = k(T_{\\text{set}}-T_0)$. Thus, $x_{\\text{eq}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ k(T_{\\text{set}}-T_0) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nTo analyze the stability of this equilibrium, we consider the dynamics of a small perturbation, $\\delta x(t)$, from the equilibrium: $x(t) = x_{\\text{eq}} + \\delta x(t)$. Substituting this into the state equation:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}(x_{\\text{eq}} + \\delta x(t)) = A(x_{\\text{eq}} + \\delta x(t)) + b $$\nSince $x_{\\text{eq}}$ is a constant vector, its derivative $\\dot{x}_{\\text{eq}}$ is zero. This gives:\n$$ \\dot{\\delta x}(t) = A x_{\\text{eq}} + A \\delta x(t) + b $$\nUsing the equilibrium condition $A x_{\\text{eq}} + b = 0$, the equation for the perturbation simplifies to the homogeneous system:\n$$ \\dot{\\delta x}(t) = A \\delta x(t) $$\nThe solution to this homogeneous equation is determined by the eigenvalues, $\\lambda_i$, of the matrix $A$. The general solution is a linear combination of terms of the form $v_i e^{\\lambda_i t}$, where $v_i$ are the corresponding eigenvectors. The stability of the equilibrium point depends on whether the perturbation $\\delta x(t)$ decays to zero, remains bounded, or grows without bound as $t \\to \\infty$.\n\n-   **Asymptotically Stable**: If all eigenvalues of $A$ have strictly negative real parts ($\\text{Re}(\\lambda_i) < 0$ for all $i$), all terms $e^{\\lambda_i t}$ will decay to zero, causing $\\delta x(t) \\to 0$. The system returns to its equilibrium point. The problem specification maps this to the integer $1$.\n-   **Unstable**: If any eigenvalue of $A$ has a strictly positive real part ($\\text{Re}(\\lambda_j) > 0$ for some $j$), the corresponding term $e^{\\lambda_j t}$ will grow exponentially, causing the perturbation $\\delta x(t)$ to grow unbounded. The system moves away from its equilibrium point. The problem specification maps this to the integer $-1$.\n-   **Marginally Stable**: If no eigenvalue has a positive real part, but at least one has a zero real part ($\\max_i(\\text{Re}(\\lambda_i)) = 0$), the perturbation does not grow exponentially but also does not decay to zero. The system's state remains in a bounded region around the equilibrium (for simple, non-repeated eigenvalues on the imaginary axis) or may drift. The problem specification maps this to the integer $0$.\n\nThe constant vector $b$ influences only the location of the equilibrium point $x_{\\text{eq}}$ but does not appear in the perturbation equation $\\dot{\\delta x} = A \\delta x$. Therefore, the stability of the equilibrium depends solely on the properties of the state matrix $A$, specifically its eigenvalues.\n\n### Part 3: Stability Classification via Eigenvalues\n\nTo find the eigenvalues of $A$, we solve the characteristic equation $\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.\n$$ \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -k/C - \\lambda & 1/C \\\\ -\\alpha & -\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0 $$\n$$ (-\\frac{k}{C} - \\lambda)(-\\lambda) - (\\frac{1}{C})(-\\alpha) = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda^2 + \\frac{k}{C} \\lambda + \\frac{\\alpha}{C} = 0 $$\nThis is a second-order characteristic polynomial. Let the eigenvalues be $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$.\n- The sum of the eigenvalues is $\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 = -\\frac{k}{C} = \\text{tr}(A)$.\n- The product of the eigenvalues is $\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 = \\frac{\\alpha}{C} = \\det(A)$.\n\nFor asymptotic stability, both eigenvalues must have negative real parts. For a second-order system, this is guaranteed if and only if both coefficients of the characteristic polynomial are positive (Routh-Hurwitz criterion). Since $C>0$ (heat capacity is a positive physical quantity), this simplifies to requiring $k > 0$ and $\\alpha > 0$.\n\nThe program will compute the eigenvalues numerically for each given parameter set $(C, k, \\alpha)$, find the maximum of their real parts, and classify the stability using the specified tolerance of $10^{-9}$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the stability of a thermal regulation system for several parameter sets.\n\n    The function derives the state matrix A for a linearized model of the system\n    and classifies the stability of the equilibrium point based on the eigenvalues of A.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Test cases are specified as (C, k, alpha, T0, Tset).\n    # The stability analysis only requires C, k, and alpha.\n    test_cases_full = [\n        # (C,   k,   alpha, T0,  Tset)\n        (10.0, 2.0, 1.0,   293, 295), # Case A\n        (5.0,  0.0, 1.0,   293, 295), # Case B\n        (10.0, 2.0, 0.0,   295, 295), # Case C\n        (10.0, 2.0, -0.5,  293, 295), # Case D\n        (1.0,  0.1, 10.0,  300, 295), # Case E\n    ]\n\n    # Extract parameters relevant to stability: (C, k, alpha)\n    test_cases = [(c, k, a) for c, k, a, t0, tset in test_cases_full]\n\n    results = []\n    # Numerical tolerance for classifying real parts of eigenvalues\n    tol = 1e-9\n\n    for C, k, alpha in test_cases:\n        # A physically meaningful system requires C > 0.\n        # The problem statement implies this by defining C as heat capacity.\n        if C = 0:\n            # This case indicates an ill-posed physical model.\n            # Handle as unstable for safety, although not expected in the test suite.\n            results.append(-1)\n            continue\n        \n        # Construct the state matrix A for the system x_dot = Ax + b,\n        # where x = [temperature_error, control_input]^T.\n        # A = [[-k/C, 1/C],\n        #      [-alpha, 0]]\n        A = np.array([\n            [-k / C, 1 / C],\n            [-alpha, 0.0]\n        ])\n\n        # Compute the eigenvalues of the state matrix A.\n        eigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvals(A)\n\n        # The stability is determined by the real parts of the eigenvalues.\n        real_parts = np.real(eigenvalues)\n        \n        # Find the maximum real part among all eigenvalues.\n        max_real_part = np.max(real_parts)\n\n        # Classify stability based on the maximum real part.\n        # 1: Asymptotically Stable (all Re(lambda)  0)\n        # 0: Marginally Stable (max(Re(lambda)) = 0, no Re(lambda) > 0)\n        # -1: Unstable (at least one Re(lambda) > 0)\n        if max_real_part > tol:\n            stability_code = -1  # Unstable\n        elif max_real_part  -tol:\n            stability_code = 1   # Asymptotically stable\n        else: # -tol = max_real_part = tol\n            stability_code = 0   # Marginally stable\n        \n        results.append(stability_code)\n\n    # Print the results in the specified format: [res1,res2,res3,...]\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```", "id": "3161126"}]}
