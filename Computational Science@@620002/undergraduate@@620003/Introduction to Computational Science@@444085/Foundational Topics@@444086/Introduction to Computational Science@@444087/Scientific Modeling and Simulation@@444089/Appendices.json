Consider the following explicit finite-volume method on a uniform grid of $N$ cells with cell width $dx = L/N$ and forward Euler time stepping with step size $dt$, to approximate $u(x,T)$ at final time $T$.\n\nConvection is discretized using the Lax-Friedrichs (also called Rusanov) numerical flux for the inviscid flux $f(u) = u^2/2$,\n$$F_{i+1/2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(f(u_i) + f(u_{i+1})\\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha\\,(u_{i+1} - u_i),$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is a suitable Lipschitz constant for the flux, which you may take as the maximum absolute value of $u$ across the domain at the current time.

You will use Richardson extrapolation principles to estimate the observed convergence orders $p$ (with respect to $dt$) and $q$ (with respect to $dx$) from numerical data, without access to an exact analytical solution. The estimation must proceed from first principles: assume the numerical solution $U$ at resolution parameter $h$ (either $h=dt$ or $h=dx$) satisfies an asymptotic error expansion $U_h = U + C h^r + \\text{higher-order terms}$ for some constant $C$ and order $r$, and use differences of solutions at successive refinements to determine $r$.\n\nYour program must:\n- Implement the described method to evolve $u(x,t)$ from $t=0$ to $t=T$ using uniform grids and periodic boundary conditions.\n- For temporal order estimation $p$, fix a sufficiently fine spatial grid with $N$ cells and compute three solutions using time steps $dt$, $dt/2$, and $dt/4$; then apply Richardson extrapolation on the differences between these three solutions on the same grid to estimate $p$.\n- For spatial order estimation $q$, fix the final time $T$ and viscosity $\\nu$, and compute three solutions on grids with $N$, $2N$, and $4N$ cells. Choose time steps sufficiently small and scaled with $dx^2$ to suppress temporal errors relative to spatial errors. Compare the solutions by projecting the finer-grid solutions to the coarser grid using cell-average block averaging, and then apply Richardson extrapolation on the differences to estimate $q$.\n\nError norms must use the discrete $L^2$ norm consistent with the grid on which the difference is measured,\n$$\\|e\\|_2 = \\sqrt{dx \\sum_i e_i^2}.$$\nTo compare solutions across different grids for spatial order estimation, first project finer solutions to the coarse grid by averaging $r$ contiguous fine cells per coarse cell, where $r$ is the integer refinement ratio, and then use the coarse-grid $dx$ in the norm.\n\nScientific realism and stability must be respected.

A solution will be developed.\n\nThe core of the solution lies in implementing a `burgers_solver` function that evolves the initial condition to a final time $T$ according to the specified finite-volume scheme. For periodic boundary conditions, array manipulation using `numpy.roll` is highly efficient. The update for the cell-averaged solution $u_i$ from time step $n$ to $n+1$ is given by:\n$$u_i^{n+1} = u_i^n - \\frac{dt}{dx}\\left(F_{i+1/2}^n - F_{i-1/2}^n\\right) + dt\\,D_i^n$$\nwhere $F_{i \\pm 1/2}^n$ are the numerical fluxes at the cell interfaces and $D_i^n$ is the discretized diffusion term, both evaluated at time $n$. The terms are:\n- $F_{i+1/2}^n = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(f(u_i^n) + f(u_{i+1}^n)\\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha^n\\,(u_{i+1}^n - u_i^n)$, with $f(u) = u^2/2$.\n- $D_i^n = \\nu \\frac{u_{i+1}^n - 2u_i^n + u_{i-1}^n}{dx^2}$.\n- $\\alpha^n = \\max(|u^n|)$.\n\nTo estimate the order of convergence $r$, we compute solutions at three refinement levels, with step sizes $h$, $h/2$, and $h/4$. Let the corresponding solutions be $U_h$, $U_{h/2}$, and $U_{h/4}$. Assuming an asymptotic error $U_h = U_{exact} + C h^r + O(h^{r+1})$, the differences between solutions are $E_1 = \\|U_h - U_{h/2}\\|_2$ and $E_2 = \\|U_{h/2} - U_{h/4}\\|_2$. The order $r$ is estimated by the formula:\n$$r = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{E_1}{E_2}\\right)$$\nFor temporal order estimation ($p$), $h=dt$ and the spatial grid is fixed. For spatial order estimation ($q$), $h=dx$ and the time step $dt$ is scaled to be a higher-order term. When comparing solutions on different grids, finer solutions are projected onto the coarsest grid using cell averaging before computing differences and norms.\n\nThe implementation will consist of:\n1.  A general-purpose solver function that implements the time-stepping loop.\n2.  Helper functions to calculate the $L^2$ norm and to project solutions from fine to coarse grids.\n3.  Specific functions for each case (A, B, C) that set up the parameters, call the solver for the three required resolutions, perform the Richardson analysis, and return the estimated order.\n4.  A main routine that calls the case-specific functions and formats the final output as requested.\nThe initial condition, being a continuous function, is discretized by evaluating it at the center of each finite volume cell, i.e., $u_i(0) = \\sin(2\\pi x_i/L)$ where $x_i = (i+0.5)dx$.

The goal is to empirically determine the convergence exponent for each method when applied to a specific multidimensional integral.\n\nThe problem formulation is scientifically sound, well-posed, and complete. All necessary data, parameters, and procedures are provided unambiguously, permitting a direct and verifiable computational solution. The task falls squarely within the domain of computational science, specifically concerning numerical methods and simulation.

A walker starts at position $x=0$ at time $t=0$ and evolves in discrete time steps of unit duration. Two models are considered: a classical random walk and a discrete-time quantum walk. Your task is to simulate the quantum walk with coin decoherence and compute the position variance, and to compute the classical counterpart analytically, then aggregate results for a specified test suite.\n\nClassical model. At each time step $t=1,2,\\dots,T$, the walker takes a step of length $1$ to the left or right with equal probability. The step outcomes are independent from one step to the next. The position at time $T$ is $X_T = \\sum_{k=1}^T \\Delta_k$, where each $\\Delta_k$ is an independent random variable taking values $\\pm 1$ with equal probability. The initial position is $X_0=0$.

The dynamics, including the Hadamard coin, conditional shift, and decoherence channel, are standard in the field of quantum information and computation. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: All aspects of the problem are defined unambiguously. The initial conditions, evolution operators, and quantities to be calculated are specified precisely. The finite position grid is defined to be large enough ($2T+1$ sites) to contain the entire support of the walker's state for $T$ steps, avoiding boundary condition artifacts. A unique, stable solution exists for each test case.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in formal mathematical language, free from subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\nThe problem passes all validation checks. It is a well-defined and scientifically valid computational task.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Principle-Based Design\n\n#### Classical Variance Derivation\n\nThe position $X_T$ of the classical walker is the sum of $T$ independent and identically distributed random variables $\\Delta_k$, each representing a single step.\nThe expectation of a single step is $E[\\Delta_k] = \\frac{1}{2}(+1) + \\frac{1}{2}(-1) = 0$.\nThe variance of a single step is $\\mathrm{Var}(\\Delta_k) = E[\\Delta_k^2] - (E[\\Delta_k])^2$. Since $\\Delta_k^2=1$, $E[\\Delta_k^2]=1$. Thus, $\\mathrm{Var}(\\Delta_k) = 1 - 0^2 = 1$.\nDue to the independence of steps, the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(X_T) = \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^T \\Delta_k\\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^T \\mathrm{Var}(\\Delta_k) = \\sum_{k=1}^T 1 = T.\n$$\nThis simple analytical result will be used for the classical part of the problem.\n\n#### Quantum Simulation Implementation\n\nThe quantum walk must be simulated numerically. The state of the system is represented by a density matrix $\\rho$ in a Hilbert space that is the tensor product of a 2-dimensional coin space and a $(2T+1)$-dimensional position space.\n\n1.  **Hilbert Space Representation**: The total Hilbert space has dimension $N = 2 \\times (2T+1)$. We establish a basis $|c, x\\rangle$, where $c \\in \\{0,1\\}$ is the coin state and $x \\in \\{-T, \\dots, T\\}$ is the position. The density matrix $\\rho$ is an $N \\times N$ complex matrix. We map the basis states to indices $k \\in \\{0, \\dots, N-1\\}$. A convenient mapping is $k = c \\cdot (2T+1) + (x+T)$.\n\n2.  **Initial State**: The initial density matrix $\\rho_0$ is constructed from the pure state $|\\psi(0)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle + i|1\\rangle) \\otimes |x=0\\rangle$. This corresponds to a $2 \\times 2$ block matrix $\\rho_{c,0} = \\frac{1}{2}\\begin{pmatrix}1  -i \\\\ i  1\\end{pmatrix}$ at the position $x=0$, and zeros elsewhere.\n\n3.  **Operator Matrices**: The evolution operators are constructed as $N \\times N$ matrices.\n    - **Coin Operator $U_c$**: Formed by the Kronecker product of the Hadamard matrix $H$ and the identity matrix on the position space, $I_{2T+1}$: $U_c = H \\otimes I_{2T+1}$.\n    - **Decoherence Projectors $P_0, P_1$**: Formed by Kronecker products $P_0 = (|0\\rangle\\langle0|) \\otimes I_{2T+1}$ and $P_1 = (|1\\rangle\\langle1|) \\otimes I_{2T+1}$.\n    - **Shift Operator $S$**: This is a block-diagonal matrix $S = S_L \\oplus S_R$, where $S_L$ implements the shift $x \\to x-1$ for the coin state $|0\\rangle$ subspace, and $S_R$ implements $x \\to x+1$ for the $|1\\rangle$ subspace. These are sub- and super-diagonal matrices, respectively.\n\n4.  **Time Evolution Loop**: For each of the $T$ time steps, the density matrix $\\rho$ is updated by sequentially applying the three operations:\n    - $\\rho \\leftarrow U_c \\rho U_c^\\dagger$\n    - $\\rho \\leftarrow (1-\\gamma) \\rho + \\gamma (P_0 \\rho P_0 + P_1 \\rho P_1)$\n    - $\\rho \\leftarrow S \\rho S^\\dagger$\n\n5.  **Calculation of Variance**: After $T$ steps, the final density matrix $\\rho_T$ is obtained.\n    - The position probability distribution $p_T(x)$ is found by taking the trace over the coin degree of freedom. This corresponds to summing the diagonal elements of $\\rho_T$ for each position $x$: $p_T(x) = \\rho_T(0,x;0,x) + \\rho_T(1,x;1,x)$.\n    - The mean $\\mu_T = \\sum_x x p_T(x)$ and variance $\\sigma_T^2 = \\sum_x x^2 p_T(x) - \\mu_T^2$ are then computed using the derived probability distribution.\n\nThis simulation will be executed for each $(T, \\gamma)$ pair in the test suite. It is known that for the specific initial state $|\\psi(0)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle + i|1\\rangle) \\otimes |x=0\\rangle$, the quantum walk exhibits diffusive behavior with $\\sigma_T^2=T$ for any decoherence rate $\\gamma \\in [0,1]$.
