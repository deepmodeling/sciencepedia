{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The Intermediate Value and Rolle's theorems are not merely abstract guarantees; they are foundational blueprints for constructing powerful numerical algorithms. This practice challenges you to translate theory into a working root-finding program. You will leverage the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) to design a sampling strategy that isolates roots, and then use Rolle's theorem to derive a theoretical lower bound on the number of local extrema a function must have to accommodate its roots [@problem_id:3145023]. This exercise provides a complete, hands-on experience in building a robust scientific tool from first principles.", "problem": "You are asked to design and implement a complete, runnable program that demonstrates how a continuous, differentiable, non-monotone function $f$ can possess multiple real roots within a single bracketed interval, uses Rolle’s theorem to obtain a lower bound on the number of local extrema needed to accommodate a given number of roots, and finds all such roots by combining sampling with the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) on subintervals.\n\nThe fundamental base you may assume includes: the definition of continuity and differentiability, the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT), the Mean Value Theorem (MVT), Rolle’s theorem, the Extreme Value Theorem, and Fermat’s theorem on stationary points. You must not assume or use any other specialized theorems or black-box solvers.\n\nTasks to be accomplished by your program:\n\n1) Theoretical lower bound via Rolle’s theorem. Consider a function $f$ that is continuous on a closed interval $[a,b]$ and differentiable on the open interval $(a,b)$. Suppose $f$ has $m$ distinct real roots in $[a,b]$. Derive, from first principles starting with the stated theorems, a general expression for the minimum number of local extrema that $f$ must have in $[a,b]$. Your program must implement this lower bound in terms of the integer count $m$ of distinct roots it finds numerically, without assuming the bound in advance.\n\n2) Root isolation and refinement by sampling and IVT. Design a sampling strategy that:\n- builds a uniform grid on $[a,b]$,\n- detects subintervals $[x_i,x_{i+1}]$ where $f(x_i)\\cdot f(x_{i+1})0$, which by the Intermediate Value Theorem each contains at least one root,\n- includes any endpoint $x_i$ where $f(x_i)=0$ as a root, and\n- refines each sign-change bracket to approximate a root using a bisection procedure until the absolute error is smaller than a prescribed tolerance.\nBecause the IVT guarantees a root only in subintervals with a sign change and the functions in this task have only simple roots, an adequately fine grid must be used to ensure that each simple root is adjacent to at least one sign-change pair of samples. For trigonometric functions, use angles in radians.\n\n3) Numerical tolerances and output. Use a bisection tolerance of $10^{-12}$ for root refinement, then round each approximated root to $6$ decimal places. When two numerically found roots are within $10^{-6}$ of each other, treat them as one root. Sort the roots in strictly increasing order for each test case. Express all angles in radians.\n\nTest suite. Your program must run on the following test cases, specified purely in mathematical terms:\n- Case $1$: $f(x)=x^3-x$ on $[-2,2]$.\n- Case $2$: $f(x)=(x-1)\\,(x-1.5)\\,(x-2.5)$ on $[0,3]$.\n- Case $3$: $f(x)=\\sin(5x)-0.2$ on $[0,2\\pi]$ with $x$ measured in radians.\n- Case $4$: $f(x)=(x-0.2)\\,(x-0.8)$ on $[0,1]$.\n- Case $5$: $f(x)=(x+1)\\,(x-2)$ on $[-1,2]$.\n\nFor each case, your program must:\n- produce the sorted list of distinct real roots in the interval (rounded to $6$ decimal places), and\n- compute the derived lower bound on the minimum number of local extrema required in the interval based solely on the integer count $m$ of distinct real roots you found.\n\nFinal output format. Your program must produce a single line of output that is a bracketed, comma-separated list of results, one per test case, with each result formatted as:\n- a two-element list, where the first element is the list of rounded roots and the second element is the integer lower bound from Task $1$.\n\nConcretely, your program must print a single line of the form\n$[\\,[\\,[r_{1,1},\\ldots,r_{1,k_1}],b_1],\\,[\\,[r_{2,1},\\ldots,r_{2,k_2}],b_2],\\,\\ldots,\\,\\,[\\,[r_{5,1},\\ldots,r_{5,k_5}],b_5]\\,]$\nwith no spaces, where $r_{i,j}$ are floats printed with exactly $6$ decimal places, and $b_i$ are integers. No other text may be printed.", "solution": "We proceed from first principles, connecting the mathematical theorems to a concrete algorithm.\n\nFoundational principles. Let $f$ be continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$.\n- Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT): If $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ have opposite signs, then there exists $c\\in(a,b)$ with $f(c)=0$.\n- Mean Value Theorem (MVT): If $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$, then there exists $c\\in(a,b)$ with $f'(c)=\\dfrac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$.\n- Rolle’s theorem: If $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, differentiable on $(a,b)$, and $f(a)=f(b)$, then there exists $c\\in(a,b)$ with $f'(c)=0$.\n- Extreme Value Theorem: If $f$ is continuous on the compact interval $[a,b]$, then $f$ attains a maximum and a minimum on $[a,b]$.\n- Fermat’s theorem: If $f$ has a local extremum at an interior point $c\\in(a,b)$ and is differentiable at $c$, then $f'(c)=0$.\n\nPart A: Lower bound on the number of local extrema in terms of the number of roots. Suppose $f$ has $m\\ge 1$ distinct real roots in $[a,b]$, denoted $r_1r_2\\cdotsr_m$, with $f(r_i)=0$ for each $i$. Consider any consecutive pair $[r_i,r_{i+1}]$. Because $f$ is continuous on $[r_i,r_{i+1}]$, the Extreme Value Theorem guarantees that $f$ attains both a maximum and a minimum there. Since $f(r_i)=f(r_{i+1})=0$ and there are no other roots inside $(r_i,r_{i+1})$ by construction, $f$ cannot vanish in the open interval, so $f$ must be either strictly positive on $(r_i,r_{i+1})$ or strictly negative on $(r_i,r_{i+1})$. Therefore, whichever of the maximum or minimum has nonzero value must be achieved at an interior point $c_i\\in(r_i,r_{i+1})$. By Fermat’s theorem, $f'(c_i)=0$, and moreover this interior extremum is a genuine local maximum or minimum (not a stationary inflection), because its value is strictly larger or smaller than the endpoint values, which are both $0$. Hence, on each of the $m-1$ subintervals between consecutive roots, there exists at least one local extremum. These extremal points lie in disjoint intervals, so they are distinct, yielding at least $m-1$ local extrema in $[a,b]$.\n\nThis argument uses Rolle’s theorem implicitly as well: from $f(r_i)=f(r_{i+1})$, there exists $c\\in(r_i,r_{i+1})$ with $f'(c)=0$. Coupled with the sign of $f$ on $(r_i,r_{i+1})$, that stationary point must correspond to a local extremum rather than a flat inflection. Consequently, a valid lower bound on the minimum number of local extrema required to accommodate $m$ distinct roots is $m-1$. For $m=0$ there is no constraint, so the bound is $0$. Thus, the bound the program must output is $\\max\\{m-1,0\\}$ computed from the numerically determined $m$.\n\nPart B: Sampling and IVT-based root isolation. The objective is to locate all real roots in $[a,b]$ for a given test function $f$. Because the Intermediate Value Theorem certifies a root in any closed subinterval where a sign change occurs, a practical strategy is:\n- Construct a uniform grid $a=x_0x_1\\cdotsx_N=b$.\n- Evaluate $f$ at each grid point. Whenever $f(x_i)=0$ within numerical tolerance, record $x_i$ as a root candidate.\n- For each adjacent pair $[x_i,x_{i+1}]$ such that $f(x_i)\\cdot f(x_{i+1})0$, there exists at least one root in $(x_i,x_{i+1})$. Use the bisection method to refine the root to a tolerance of $10^{-12}$, which is valid because $f$ is continuous and the sign change ensures a root. Bisection contracts the bracket by replacing it with the half that exhibits a sign change, guaranteeing linear convergence to a root.\n- To ensure that every simple root is adjacent to at least one sign-change pair, use sufficiently fine grids tailored to each test case. Because all test functions here have simple roots and are smooth, a dense uniform grid suffices to detect every crossing.\n- De-duplication: Since a root may coincide with a grid point or be bracketed by neighboring pairs on both sides, merge root candidates that lie within $10^{-6}$ of each other, keeping their average as the representative.\n\nPart C: Implemented test suite and numerical details. The functions and intervals are:\n- Case $1$: $f(x)=x^3-x$ on $[-2,2]$.\n- Case $2$: $f(x)=(x-1)\\,(x-1.5)\\,(x-2.5)$ on $[0,3]$.\n- Case $3$: $f(x)=\\sin(5x)-0.2$ on $[0,2\\pi]$ in radians.\n- Case $4$: $f(x)=(x-0.2)\\,(x-0.8)$ on $[0,1]$.\n- Case $5$: $f(x)=(x+1)\\,(x-2)$ on $[-1,2]$.\n\nFor each case, the algorithm isolates all sign-change subintervals, refines each to a root with bisection to absolute tolerance $10^{-12}$, merges duplicates at a threshold of $10^{-6}$, sorts the results, and rounds each root to $6$ decimal places. Finally it computes $m$ and reports the bound $\\max\\{m-1,0\\}$.\n\nBecause trigonometric inputs use radians, all evaluations of $\\sin(5x)$ use $x$ measured in radians. The final line prints a single bracketed list of results with the exact formatting specified: for each case, a two-element list whose first element is the list of $6$-decimal roots, and whose second element is the integer bound, with no spaces anywhere in the output.\n\nCorrectness justification. The detection of sign changes leverages the Intermediate Value Theorem to guarantee the existence of a root in each flagged subinterval. The bisection method preserves a sign-change bracket and converges to a root. For simple roots in smooth functions, a sufficiently fine uniform grid ensures that near each root the function values on adjacent grid points have opposite sign, so every root is isolated at least once. The de-duplication step removes numerical redundancies. The lower bound on local extrema equals $m-1$ by the argument based on Rolle’s theorem, the Extreme Value Theorem, and Fermat’s theorem applied to each closed interval between consecutive roots.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef bisection(f, a, b, tol=1e-12, max_iter=100):\n    fa = f(a)\n    fb = f(b)\n    if abs(fa)  tol:\n        return a\n    if abs(fb)  tol:\n        return b\n    # Ensure there is a sign change\n    if fa * fb  0:\n        # No sign change; bisection not applicable\n        return None\n    left, right = a, b\n    f_left, f_right = fa, fb\n    for _ in range(max_iter):\n        mid = 0.5 * (left + right)\n        f_mid = f(mid)\n        if abs(f_mid)  tol or 0.5 * (right - left)  tol:\n            return mid\n        # Choose the subinterval that preserves sign change\n        if f_left * f_mid = 0:\n            right, f_right = mid, f_mid\n        else:\n            left, f_left = mid, f_mid\n    return 0.5 * (left + right)\n\ndef isolate_and_refine_roots(f, a, b, n_grid, bisect_tol=1e-12, merge_tol=1e-6):\n    xs = np.linspace(a, b, n_grid)\n    fs = f(xs)\n    # Collect root candidates from endpoint zeros\n    candidates = []\n\n    # Check exact/near-zero samples\n    for xi, fi in zip(xs, fs):\n        if np.isfinite(fi) and abs(fi)  1e-12:\n            candidates.append(float(xi))\n\n    # Check sign changes on consecutive intervals\n    for i in range(len(xs) - 1):\n        x0, x1 = xs[i], xs[i + 1]\n        f0, f1 = fs[i], fs[i + 1]\n        if not (np.isfinite(f0) and np.isfinite(f1)):\n            continue\n        prod = f0 * f1\n        if prod  0.0:\n            r = bisection(f, x0, x1, tol=bisect_tol, max_iter=200)\n            if r is not None:\n                candidates.append(float(r))\n\n    # Deduplicate close roots\n    if not candidates:\n        roots = []\n    else:\n        candidates = sorted(candidates)\n        roots = [candidates[0]]\n        for r in candidates[1:]:\n            if abs(r - roots[-1]) = merge_tol:\n                # Merge by averaging for stability\n                roots[-1] = 0.5 * (roots[-1] + r)\n            else:\n                roots.append(r)\n\n    # Sort and round to 6 decimals for final reporting\n    roots.sort()\n    roots = [round(r, 12) for r in roots]  # preserve accuracy before formatting\n    return roots\n\ndef format_output(all_results):\n    # all_results is a list of tuples: (roots_list, bound_int)\n    # We must output a single line with no spaces, floats with exactly 6 decimals.\n    def fmt_float(x):\n        return f\"{x:.6f}\"\n\n    parts = []\n    for roots, bound in all_results:\n        roots_str = \"[\" + \",\".join(fmt_float(r) for r in roots) + \"]\"\n        part = \"[\" + roots_str + \",\" + str(int(bound)) + \"]\"\n        parts.append(part)\n    return \"[\" + \",\".join(parts) + \"]\"\n\ndef solve():\n    # Define test cases (functions and intervals)\n    # Case 1: f(x) = x^3 - x on [-2, 2]\n    def f1(x):\n        return x**3 - x\n\n    # Case 2: f(x) = (x - 1)*(x - 1.5)*(x - 2.5) on [0, 3]\n    def f2(x):\n        return (x - 1.0) * (x - 1.5) * (x - 2.5)\n\n    # Case 3: f(x) = sin(5x) - 0.2 on [0, 2π] (radians)\n    def f3(x):\n        return np.sin(5.0 * x) - 0.2\n\n    # Case 4: f(x) = (x - 0.2)*(x - 0.8) on [0, 1]\n    def f4(x):\n        return (x - 0.2) * (x - 0.8)\n\n    # Case 5: f(x) = (x + 1)*(x - 2) on [-1, 2]\n    def f5(x):\n        return (x + 1.0) * (x - 2.0)\n\n    # Sampling densities chosen to reliably capture all simple roots\n    test_cases = [\n        (f1, -2.0, 2.0, 40001),               # fine grid for cubic\n        (f2, 0.0, 3.0, 40001),                # fine grid for cubic with three roots\n        (f3, 0.0, 2.0 * np.pi, 60001),        # dense grid for sin wave crossings\n        (f4, 0.0, 1.0, 20001),                # quadratic with two interior roots\n        (f5, -1.0, 2.0, 30001),               # linear factors, roots at endpoints\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for f, a, b, n_grid in test_cases:\n        roots = isolate_and_refine_roots(f, a, b, n_grid=n_grid, bisect_tol=1e-12, merge_tol=1e-6)\n        # Compute bound on minimum number of local extrema required: max(m - 1, 0)\n        m = len(roots)\n        bound = max(m - 1, 0)\n        results.append((roots, bound))\n\n    # Print in exact required single-line format with no spaces and floats with 6 decimals\n    print(format_output(results))\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "3145023"}, {"introduction": "While the IVT-based sampling method is a versatile tool, it is crucial to understand its limitations.

Then, compare the IVT-certified subinterval count with the Sturm exact root count for several test cases.\n\nFundamental bases for this task:\n- Continuity of polynomials: Any real-coefficient polynomial $p(x)$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$, hence on any $[a,b]$.\n- Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT): If a continuous function $f$ on $[a,b]$ has $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ of opposite signs, then there exists $c \\in (a,b)$ with $f(c)=0$.\n- Mean Value Theorem (MVT) and Rolle’s Theorem: If a differentiable function $f$ has $f(a)=f(b)$, then there exists $c \\in (a,b)$ such that $f'(c)=0$.

It is scientifically grounded in established mathematical principles (Sturm's Theorem, the Intermediate Value Theorem), well-posed with a complete and consistent set of definitions and data, and objective in its formulation. We will proceed with a solution.\n\nThe task is to implement and compare two distinct methods for counting real roots of a polynomial $p(x)$ within a given interval $[a,b]$. The first method, based on Sturm's Theorem, provides an exact count of distinct roots. The second, based on the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT), provides a count of subintervals certified to contain at least one root.\n\n**Method 1: Root Counting via Sturm's Theorem**\n\nSturm's Theorem offers a robust algorithm to determine the exact number of distinct real roots of a polynomial with real coefficients in a given interval $(a,b)$. The core of the method is the construction of a special sequence of polynomials called a Sturm sequence.\n\nFor a given polynomial $p(x)$, its standard Sturm sequence is constructed as follows:\n$1$. The first two elements are $p_0(x) = p(x)$ and its first derivative $p_1(x) = p'(x)$.\n$2$. Subsequent elements are generated using the polynomial Euclidean algorithm. For $k \\ge 1$, we define $p_{k+1}(x)$ as the negative of the remainder of the division of $p_{k-1}(x)$ by $p_k(x)$:\n$$p_{k+1}(x) = -\\operatorname{rem}(p_{k-1}(x), p_k(x))$$\nThis process is repeated until the remainder is the zero polynomial, at which point the sequence terminates.\n\nOnce the Sturm sequence $\\{p_0(x), p_1(x), \\dots, p_m(x)\\}$ is constructed, we define $V(x_0)$ as the number of sign changes in the sequence of evaluated numbers $\\{p_0(x_0), p_1(x_0), \\dots, p_m(x_0)\\}$. When evaluating $V(x_0)$, any terms that are exactly zero are omitted from the sequence before counting sign changes.\n\nSturm's Theorem states that for a polynomial $p(x)$ with no multiple roots at the endpoints $a$ or $b$, the number of distinct real roots in the interval $(a,b)$ is given by the difference in sign variations at the endpoints:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{Sturm}} = V(a) - V(b)$$\nThe specified convention of removing zeros from the evaluated sequence ensures the theorem holds even if $a$ or $b$ are roots of $p(x)$ or any $p_i(x)$.\n\nThe implementation will use the `numpy` library. Polynomials are represented by arrays of their coefficients in descending order of power. The derivative $p'(x)$ is computed using `numpy.polyder`. The polynomial division and remainder calculation are performed with `numpy.polydiv`. Evaluation of polynomials at specific points $a$ and $b$ is done using `numpy.polyval`. The numerical tolerance for identifying zero values is $\\tau = 10^{-12}$.\n\n**Method 2: Root Certification via the Intermediate Value Theorem**\n\nThe Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) states that if a function $f(x)$ is continuous on a closed interval $[a,b]$, and $y_0$ is any value between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, then there exists at least one $c \\in (a,b)$ such that $f(c) = y_0$. A direct corollary for root finding is that if $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ have opposite signs (i.e., $f(a)f(b)  0$), then there must be at least one root in the open interval $(a,b)$.\n\nSince all polynomials are continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$, this theorem is applicable. The algorithm proceeds as follows:\n$1$. The interval $[a,b]$ is partitioned into a set of subintervals. A regular grid of points $x_i$ is generated with a specified spacing $h$. The grid points are defined as $x_0=a, x_1=a+h, \\dots, x_k=a+kh$ where $a+kh \\le b$, with the endpoint $x_{N}=b$ explicitly included if not already present. This results in subintervals $[x_i, x_{i+1}]$.\n$2$. The polynomial $p(x)$ is evaluated at each grid point $x_i$.\n$3$. For each subinterval $[x_i, x_{i+1}]$, we check for a strict sign change between the endpoints, i.e., $p(x_i) p(x_{i+1})  0$. When checking signs, values whose magnitude is less than or equal to the tolerance $\\tau=10^{-12}$ are treated as zero. A strict sign change requires both endpoints to be non-zero.\n$4$. The total count, $C_{\\mathrm{IVT}}$, is the number of subintervals for which such a strict sign change is detected.\n\nThis method gives a lower bound on the number of roots. It has known limitations:\n-   It cannot detect roots of even multiplicity (e.g., $(x-c)^2$), as the function touches the axis at $x=c$ without changing sign.\n-   It can miss pairs of distinct, closely-spaced roots (or any even number of roots) if they both fall within a single subinterval $[x_i, x_{i+1}]$ such that $p(x_i)$ and $p(x_{i+1})$ have the same sign.\n-   It will not count a root if it falls exactly on a grid point, due to the requirement of a strict sign change.\n\nThe implementation will generate the grid points as specified and use `numpy.polyval` to evaluate the polynomial. The logic for counting sign changes will adhere to the specified handling of the numerical tolerance $\\tau$.\n\nThe final process involves applying both algorithms to the provided test cases and reporting the pair of counts $[C_{\\mathrm{IVT}}, C_{\\mathrm{Sturm}}]$ for each.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Implements and compares Sturm's theorem and an IVT-based method for\n    counting real roots of polynomials on an interval.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    TAU = 1e-12\n\n    def trim_poly(p):\n        \"\"\"Removes leading zero coefficients from a polynomial representation.\"\"\"\n        p = np.atleast_1d(p)\n        non_zeros = np.flatnonzero(p)\n        if non_zeros.size == 0:\n            return np.array([0.0])\n        return p[non_zeros[0]:]\n\n    def build_sturm_sequence(p_coeffs):\n        \"\"\"Constructs the Sturm sequence for a given polynomial.\"\"\"\n        p0 = trim_poly(p_coeffs)\n        if len(p0) == 1 and p0[0] == 0:\n            return []\n        \n        p1 = np.polyder(p0)\n        \n        sturm_seq = [p0, p1]\n        \n        pk_minus_1 = p0\n        pk = p1\n        \n        while True:\n            # The sequence terminates if pk is a zero polynomial\n            if len(pk) == 1 and np.isclose(pk[0], 0):\n                break\n            \n            # Use np.polydiv for polynomial long division\n            _quot, rem = np.polydiv(pk_minus_1, pk)\n            pk_plus_1 = -trim_poly(rem)\n            \n            # Check if the new polynomial (remainder) is zero\n            if len(pk_plus_1) == 1 and np.isclose(pk_plus_1[0], 0):\n                break\n            \n            sturm_seq.append(pk_plus_1)\n            \n            pk_minus_1 = pk\n            pk = pk_plus_1\n            \n        return sturm_seq\n\n    def count_sign_variations(sturm_seq, x, tau):\n        \"\"\"Counts the number of sign changes in the Sturm sequence evaluated at x.\"\"\"\n        if not sturm_seq:\n            return 0\n        \n        values = [np.polyval(p, x) for p in sturm_seq]\n        \n        # Filter out values that are numerically zero\n        non_zero_values = [v for v in values if abs(v)  tau]\n        \n        changes = 0\n        for i in range(len(non_zero_values) - 1):\n            if non_zero_values[i] * non_zero_values[i+1]  0:\n                changes += 1\n                \n        return changes\n\n    def sturm_root_count(p_coeffs, a, b, tau):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the number of distinct real roots in (a, b) using Sturm's Theorem.\n        \"\"\"\n        seq = build_sturm_sequence(p_coeffs)\n        Va = count_sign_variations(seq, a, tau)\n        Vb = count_sign_variations(seq, b, tau)\n        return Va - Vb\n\n    def ivt_root_count(p_coeffs, a, b, h, tau):\n        \"\"\"\n        Counts subintervals with a certified root using the Intermediate Value Theorem.\n        \"\"\"\n        if a  b:\n            a, b = b, a\n        \n        # Generate grid points\n        num_full_steps = np.floor((b - a) / h)\n        grid_points = a + np.arange(num_full_steps + 1) * h\n        \n        # Ensure the endpoint b is included\n        if not np.isclose(grid_points[-1], b):\n            grid_points = np.append(grid_points, b)\n        \n        # Evaluate polynomial at grid points\n        p_values = np.polyval(p_coeffs, grid_points)\n        \n        # Determine signs, treating near-zeros as 0\n        signs = np.sign(p_values)\n        signs[np.abs(p_values) = tau] = 0\n        \n        ivt_count = 0\n        for i in range(len(signs) - 1):\n            # Check for a strict sign change (product is -1)\n            if signs[i] * signs[i+1]  0:\n                ivt_count += 1\n                \n        return ivt_count\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        {'p_coeffs': [1, 0, -1, 0], 'a': -2, 'b': 2, 'h': 0.4},\n        {'p_coeffs': [1, 0, -3, 2], 'a': -3, 'b': 3, 'h': 0.6},\n        {'p_coeffs': [1, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0], 'a': -10, 'b': 10, 'h': 4.7},\n        {'p_coeffs': [1, 0.3, -0.2875, 0.0375], 'a': -1, 'b': 1, 'h': 0.5},\n        {'p_coeffs': [1, 0, 1], 'a': -5, 'b': 5, 'h': 1.0},\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        p, a, b, h = case['p_coeffs'], case['a'], case['b'], case['h']\n        \n        c_ivt = ivt_root_count(p, a, b, h, TAU)\n        c_sturm = sturm_root_count(p, a, b, TAU)\n        \n        results.append([c_ivt, c_sturm])\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "3144944"}, {"introduction": "The Mean Value Theorem and its extensions, like Taylor's theorem, are cornerstones of numerical analysis, especially in quantifying the error of our approximations.

The entire process rests upon Taylor's theorem and the properties of continuous functions.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Central Difference Error Formula\n\nThe task is to derive the error term for the central difference approximation of the first derivative, $D_{c}(f;x,h) = \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x-h)}{2h}$. The error is defined as $E = f'(x) - D_{c}(f;x,h)$. We assume the function $f$ is three times continuously differentiable, i.e., $f \\in C^3$, in a neighborhood of the point $x$.\n\nWe begin with the Taylor expansion of $f(x+h)$ and $f(x-h)$ around $x$. According to Taylor's theorem with the Lagrange form of the remainder, for some $\\xi_1 \\in (x, x+h)$ and $\\xi_2 \\in (x-h, x)$, we can write:\n$$\nf(x+h) = f(x) + f'(x)h + \\frac{f''(x)}{2!}h^2 + \\frac{f^{(3)}(\\xi_1)}{3!}h^3\n$$\n$$\nf(x-h) = f(x) - f'(x)h + \\frac{f''(x)}{2!}h^2 - \\frac{f^{(3)}(\\xi_2)}{3!}h^3\n$$\nSubtracting the second expansion from the first eliminates the terms with $f(x)$ and $f''(x)$:\n$$\nf(x+h) - f(x-h) = \\left( f'(x)h - (-f'(x)h) \\right) + \\left( \\frac{f^{(3)}(\\xi_1)}{6}h^3 - \\left(-\\frac{f^{(3)}(\\xi_2)}{6}h^3\\right) \\right)\n$$\n$$\nf(x+h) - f(x-h) = 2f'(x)h + \\frac{h^3}{6} \\left( f^{(3)}(\\xi_1) + f^{(3)}(\\xi_2) \\right)\n$$\nTo find an expression for the central difference formula, we divide by $2h$ (since $h  0$):\n$$\n\\frac{f(x+h) - f(x-h)}{2h} = f'(x) + \\frac{h^2}{12} \\left( f^{(3)}(\\xi_1) + f^{(3)}(\\xi_2) \\right)\n$$\nThis gives the truncation error of the approximation, $D_{c}(f;x,h) - f'(x)$. The problem defines the error as $E = f'(x) - D_{c}(f;x,h)$, so we have:\n$$\nE = - \\frac{h^2}{12} \\left( f^{(3)}(\\xi_1) + f^{(3)}(\\xi_2) \\right)\n$$\nTo express this error in terms of a single point $\\xi$, we use the Intermediate Value Theorem. Since $f$ is assumed to be $C^3$, its third derivative $f^{(3)}$ is a continuous function. The points $\\xi_1$ and $\\xi_2$ are in the interval $(x-h, x+h)$. The expression $\\frac{1}{2}(f^{(3)}(\\xi_1) + f^{(3)}(\\xi_2))$ represents the average of two values of the continuous function $f^{(3)}$ over the interval $(\\xi_2, \\xi_1) \\subset (x-h, x+h)$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must exist a point $\\xi \\in (\\xi_2, \\xi_1)$, and therefore $\\xi \\in (x-h, x+h)$, such that:\n$$\nf^{(3)}(\\xi) = \\frac{f^{(3)}(\\xi_1) + f^{(3)}(\\xi_2)}{2}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into our expression for the error $E$:\n$$\nE = - \\frac{h^2}{12} \\left( 2 f^{(3)}(\\xi) \\right)\n$$\nThis yields the final form of the error term:\n$$\nE = f'(x) - D_{c}(f;x,h) = -\\frac{h^2}{6} f^{(3)}(\\xi)\n$$\nfor some $\\xi \\in (x-h, x+h)$. This completes the derivation.\n\n### Part 2: Numerical Procedure to Compute $\\xi$\n\nBased on the derived error formula, we can devise a numerical procedure to find $\\xi$.\nThe inputs are the functions $f$, $f'$, $f^{(3)}$, a point $x$, and a step size $h  0$.\n\n1.  **Compute Observed Error**: First, we calculate the central difference approximation $D_{c}(f;x,h)$ and then the \"observed\" error, $E_{obs}$, for which we have an exact value since $f'(x)$ is known:\n    $$\n    E_{obs} = f'(x) - \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x-h)}{2h}\n    $$\n2.  **Determine Target Value $y^\\star$**: We equate the observed error with the theoretical error expression:\n    $$\n    E_{obs} = -\\frac{h^2}{6} f^{(3)}(\\xi)\n    $$\n    We can solve for $f^{(3)}(\\xi)$ to find the target value, $y^\\star$, that our desired point $\\xi$ must satisfy:\n    $$\n    y^\\star = f^{(3)}(\\xi) = -\\frac{6 E_{obs}}{h^2} = -\\frac{6}{h^2} \\left( f'(x) - \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x-h)}{2h} \\right)\n    $$\n3.  **Solve for $\\xi$**: The problem is now reduced to finding a root for the equation $f^{(3)}(t) - y^\\star = 0$ within the interval $[x-h, x+h]$.\n\n    -   **Monotonic Case**: For the test cases where $f^{(3)}(t)$ is monotonic on $[x-h, x+h]$, the theory guarantees that $y^\\star$ lies between the values $f^{(3)}(x-h)$ and $f^{(3)}(x+h)$. This is because $y^\\star$ is the average of $f^{(3)}$ at two internal points $\\xi_1$ and $\\xi_2$. Thus, we have a bracketed root for the function $G(t) = f^{(3)}(t) - y^\\star$. The bisection method is a robust and suitable choice for finding the unique root $\\xi$ in this case. We iteratively narrow the interval $[a, b]$ (initially $[x-h, x+h]$) until the desired precision for $\\xi$ is achieved.\n\n    -   **Constant Case**: If $f^{(3)}(t)$ is constant, say $f^{(3)}(t) = C$, on the interval, then the derivation implies $y^\\star = \\frac{C+C}{2} = C$. The equation becomes $C=C$, which is true for any $t \\in [x-h, x+h]$. In this degenerate situation, any value of $\\xi$ in the interval is technically correct. As per the problem's instruction and as a logical choice for a representative point, we select the center of the interval, $\\xi = x$. This is also consistent with the exact analytical result for polynomials of degree $4$ (where $f^{(3)}$ is linear) which yields $\\xi = x$, and this choice provides a continuous limit as $h \\to 0$.\n\nThe numerical algorithm is implemented as follows: first, calculate $y^\\star$. Then, check if $f^{(3)}(x-h)$ and $f^{(3)}(x+h)$ are close enough to be considered equal (within a numerical tolerance), and if so, return $\\xi=x$. Otherwise, apply the bisection method to $G(t) = f^{(3)}(t) - y^\\star$ on the interval $[x-h, x+h]$ to find $\\xi$.\n\n### Part 3: Implementation\n\nThe complete program implements the described procedure. A function `compute_xi` takes the functions $f$, $f'$, $f^{(3)}$, and parameters $x$ and $h$ as input, and returns the computed value of $\\xi$. The main `solve` function iterates through the four specified test cases and their respective lists of $h$ values. For each combination, it calls `compute_xi` and calculates the distance $|\\xi - x|$. These distances are collected into a single flat list and printed in the required format. The functions for each case are defined using lambda expressions for conciseness. For the constant case $f^{(3)}(t)=6$, the function is defined as `lambda t: 6.0 + 0*t` to ensure it is a valid callable that accepts an argument, which is good practice. The bisection method is implemented for a fixed number of iterations ($100$) which is sufficient to achieve double-precision accuracy.
