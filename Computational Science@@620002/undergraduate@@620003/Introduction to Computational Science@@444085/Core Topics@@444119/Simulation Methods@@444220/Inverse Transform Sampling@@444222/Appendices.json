Deriving the sampler for this distribution is an excellent exercise because its probability density function involves an absolute value, naturally leading to a piecewise cumulative distribution function (CDF). This problem will guide you through the process of integration and inversion for each piece and highlights the important practical consideration of ensuring numerical stability at the boundaries of the domain [@problem_id:3244399].", "problem": "You are to implement inverse transform sampling to generate independent random variates from a Laplace (double exponential) distribution at the advanced undergraduate level. Your derivation and algorithm must start from the fundamental definitions of a probability density function and a cumulative distribution function and the well-tested fact that transforming a uniform random variable through the inverse cumulative distribution function yields a sample from the target distribution. Concretely, you must work from the following base: if $U$ is a continuous random variable uniformly distributed on $(0,1)$ and $F_X$ is the cumulative distribution function of a continuous random variable $X$, then $F_X(X)$ is uniformly distributed on $(0,1)$ and, conversely, $X = F_X^{-1}(U)$ has cumulative distribution function $F_X$. You must not assume any pre-derived formulas specific to the Laplace distribution; derive them with correct piecewise integration and inversion starting from the Laplace probability density function.\n\nTask:\n- Using only the fundamental definitions and facts stated above, derive the inverse cumulative distribution function for the Laplace (double exponential) distribution with location parameter $\\mu$ and scale parameter $b$, expressed entirely in terms of $\\mu$, $b$, and $U$.\n- Design and implement a numerically stable inverse transform sampling routine that, given $\\mu$, $b$, a positive integer $n$, and an integer random seed $\\text{seed}$, generates $n$ independent samples from the Laplace distribution. You must ensure that the mapping of uniform values at the boundaries $0$ and $1$ does not produce non-finite outputs; explain and implement a principled way to avoid such boundary issues consistent with floating-point arithmetic.\n- For random-sampling test cases, compute and return the sample mean, the population variance (i.e., divide by $n$, not by $n-1$), and the sample median of the generated samples.\n- For a deterministic-mapping test case, directly evaluate the inverse cumulative distribution function at specified uniform values and return the mapped values.\n\nConstraints:\n- Use the Laplace probability density function with parameters $\\mu$ and $b$, where $b>0$. Do not use any specialized distribution routines from external libraries; your implementation must be based on the derived inverse cumulative distribution function and the uniform random number generator.\n- The program should be self-contained, require no user input, and use only the Python Standard Library and the specified numerical library.\n- Angles are not involved; no angle units are required. No physical quantities are involved; no physical units are required.\n- All outputs must be expressed as decimal floats.\n\nTest Suite:\nProvide results for the following test cases:\n1.

Random generation (shifted and narrower scale): $\\mu = 2.5$, $b = 0.5$, $n = 50000$, $\\text{seed} = 271828$.\n3. Random generation (edge scale, extremely small): $\\mu = -3$, $b = 10^{-6}$, $n = 3$, $\\text{seed} = 99$.\n4. Deterministic mapping (boundary stress test for the inverse map): $\\mu = 1$, $b = 2$ evaluated at uniform values $[10^{-12}, 0.5, 1 - 10^{-12}]$.\n\nAnswer Specification:\n- For each of the first three test cases, output a list of three floats representing $[\\text{mean}, \\text{variance}, \\text{median}]$ in that order for the generated samples.\n- For the fourth test case, output a list of three floats representing the mapped values of the specified uniform inputs under the inverse cumulative distribution function.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (for example, $[result1,result2,result3]$), where each $resultk$ conforms to the specification above.

It requires a rigorous derivation of the inverse cumulative distribution function from first principles, followed by a numerically robust implementation.\n\n### Step 1: Derivation of the Laplace Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)\n\nThe process begins with the probability density function (PDF) for a Laplace-distributed random variable $X$ with location parameter $\\mu$ and scale parameter $b > 0$. The PDF is given by:\n$$f_X(x; \\mu, b) = \\frac{1}{2b} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|x-\\mu|}{b}\\right)$$\nThe cumulative distribution function (CDF), $F_X(x) = P(X \\le x)$, is obtained by integrating the PDF from $-\\infty$ to $x$:\n$$F_X(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{x} \\frac{1}{2b} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|t-\\mu|}{b}\\right) dt$$\nDue to the absolute value term $|t-\\mu|$, the integral must be evaluated piecewise.\n\n**Case 1: $x \\le \\mu$**\nFor any $t$ in the integration range $(-\\infty, x]$, we have $t \\le x \\le \\mu$, which implies $t-\\mu \\le 0$. Therefore, $|t-\\mu| = -(t-\\mu) = \\mu-t$. The CDF is:\n$$F_X(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{x} \\frac{1}{2b} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\mu-t}{b}\\right) dt = \\frac{1}{2b} \\int_{-\\infty}^{x} \\exp\\left(\\frac{t-\\mu}{b}\\right) dt$$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$F_X(x) = \\frac{1}{2b} \\left[ b \\exp\\left(\\frac{t-\\mu}{b}\\right) \\right]_{-\\infty}^{x} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{b}\\right) - \\lim_{t\\to-\\infty} \\exp\\left(\\frac{t-\\mu}{b}\\right) \\right)$$\n$$F_X(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{b}\\right)$$\n\n**Case 2: $x > \\mu$**\nThe integral is split at the point $t=\\mu$:\n$$F_X(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\mu} f_X(t) dt + \\int_{\\mu}^{x} f_X(t) dt$$\nThe first term is $F_X(\\mu)$, which can be found from the result of Case 1: $F_X(\\mu) = \\frac{1}{2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\mu-\\mu}{b}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}$. This is expected, as the distribution is symmetric about its median, $\\mu$.\nFor the second term, where $t \\in [\\mu, x]$, we have $t-\\mu \\ge 0$, so $|t-\\mu| = t-\\mu$.\n$$\\int_{\\mu}^{x} \\frac{1}{2b} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t-\\mu}{b}\\right) dt = \\frac{1}{2b} \\left[ -b \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t-\\mu}{b}\\right) \\right]_{\\mu}^{x}$$\n$$= -\\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x-\\mu}{b}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\mu-\\mu}{b}\\right) \\right] = -\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x-\\mu}{b}\\right) - 1\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x-\\mu}{b}\\right)\\right)$$\nCombining the two terms for $x > \\mu$:\n$$F_X(x) = F_X(\\mu) + \\frac{1}{2} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x-\\mu}{b}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x-\\mu}{b}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x-\\mu}{b}\\right)$$\n\nThe complete piecewise CDF is:\n$$F_X(x) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{b}\\right) & \\text{if } x \\le \\mu \\\\ 1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x-\\mu}{b}\\right) & \\text{if } x > \\mu \\end{cases}$$\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Inverse CDF (Quantile Function)\n\nThe inverse transform sampling method relies on the fact that if $U$ is a random variable uniformly distributed on $(0,1)$, then $X = F_X^{-1}(U)$ is a random variable with CDF $F_X$. To find the inverse CDF, we set $u = F_X(x)$ for $u \\in (0,1)$ and solve for $x$.\n\n**Case 1: $0  u \\le 0.5$ (corresponds to $x \\le \\mu$)**\n$$u = \\frac{1}{2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{b}\\right)$$\n$$2u = \\exp\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{b}\\right)$$\n$$\\ln(2u) = \\frac{x-\\mu}{b}$$\n$$x = \\mu + b \\ln(2u)$$\n\n**Case 2: $0.5  u  1$ (corresponds to $x > \\mu$)**\n$$u = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x-\\mu}{b}\\right)$$\n$$1-u = \\frac{1}{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x-\\mu}{b}\\right)$$\n$$2(1-u) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x-\\mu}{b}\\right)$$\n$$\\ln(2(1-u)) = -\\frac{x-\\mu}{b}$$\n$$x = \\mu - b \\ln(2(1-u))$$\n\nThe complete piecewise inverse CDF, $x = F_X^{-1}(u)$, is:\n$$F_X^{-1}(u) = \\begin{cases} \\mu + b \\ln(2u)  \\text{if } 0  u \\le 0.5 \\\\ \\mu - b \\ln(2(1-u))  \\text{if } 0.5  u  1 \\end{cases}$$\n\n### Step 3: Algorithm Design and Numerical Stability\n\nThe derived inverse CDF involves logarithmic terms, $\\ln(u)$ and $\\ln(1-u)$, which are singular at $u=0$ and $u=1$, respectively. The domain of the theoretical inverse CDF is strictly the open interval $(0,1)$. However, a numerical random number generator may operate on a closed or semi-closed interval, such as $[0,1)$, potentially yielding a value of $0$. A direct evaluation at $u=0$ would result in $\\ln(0)$, which is non-finite $(-\\infty)$, violating the problem's requirement for finite outputs.\n\nTo create a numerically stable implementation, we must adopt a principled approach for handling these boundary values. The occurrence of an exact $0.0$ from a floating-point generator for a continuous distribution is a numerical artifact. We interpret this value as representing a sample that belongs to the smallest representable positive interval $[0, \\epsilon_{\\text{min}})$, where $\\epsilon_{\\text{min}}$ is the smallest positive normalized number for the given floating-point type. To ensure a finite output, we map any input $u=0$ to $\\epsilon_{\\text{min}}$. This regularization step guarantees that the argument to the logarithm is always positive, correctly producing a large-magnitude finite number that represents the distribution's tail behavior. The `numpy.finfo` utility provides a standard way to obtain this machine epsilon. The test cases do not involve an input of exactly $u=1$, but a similar regularization would apply.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  For a given test case, define parameters $\\mu$, $b$, and for random cases, $n$ and `seed`.\n2.  Generate an array of $n$ uniform random numbers $u_i$ on $[0,1)$ or use the deterministic values provided.\n3.  Regularize the uniform values: any $u_i$ that is exactly $0$ is replaced by the smallest positive representable float.\n4.  Apply the piecewise inverse CDF formula in a vectorized manner using boolean masking:\n    -   For all $u_i \\le 0.5$, compute $x_i = \\mu + b \\ln(2u_i)$.\n    -   For all $u_i  0.5$, compute $x_i = \\mu - b \\ln(2(1-u_i))$.\n5.  For random generation cases, compute the sample mean, population variance (dividing by $n$), and sample median of the resulting samples $x_i$.\n6.  For the deterministic mapping case, return the computed $x_i$ values.\n7.

The total area under the PDF must be $1$. The area of the triangle is given by $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$.\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} (b-a) h = 1 \\implies h = \\frac{2}{b-a}\n$$\nThe PDF is a piecewise linear function.\nFor $a \\le x \\le c$, the line passes through $(a, 0)$ and $(c, h)$.

This value is the total probability mass in the interval $[a, c]$.\n\nFor $c  x \\le b$:\n$$\nF(x) = F(c) + \\int_{c}^{x} \\frac{2(b-t)}{(b-a)(b-c)} \\,dt \\\\\nF(x) = \\frac{c-a}{b-a} + \\frac{2}{(b-a)(b-c)} \\left[ -\\frac{(b-t)^2}{2} \\right]_{c}^{x} \\\\\nF(x) = \\frac{c-a}{b-a} + \\frac{-(b-x)^2 - (-(b-c)^2)}{(b-a)(b-c)} \\\\\nF(x) = \\frac{c-a}{b-a} + \\frac{(b-c)^2 - (b-x)^2}{(b-a)(b-c)}\n$$\nA more elegant form is found by simplifying:\n$$\nF(x) = \\frac{(c-a)(b-c) + (b-c)^2 - (b-x)^2}{(b-a)(b-c)} = \\frac{(b-c)(c-a+b-c) - (b-x)^2}{(b-a)(b-c)} \\\\\nF(x) = \\frac{(b-c)(b-a) - (b-x)^2}{(b-a)(b-c)} = 1 - \\frac{(b-x)^2}{(b-a)(b-c)}\n$$\nSo, the complete CDF is:\n$$\nF(x) = \\begin{cases}\n0  \\text{if } x  a \\\\\n\\frac{(x-a)^2}{(b-a)(c-a)}  \\text{if } a \\le x \\le c \\\\\n1 - \\frac{(b-x)^2}{(b-a)(b-c)}  \\text{if } c  x \\le b \\\\\n1  \\text{if } x  b\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n**3. Inverse CDF (Quantile Function), $F^{-1}(u)$**\n\nTo implement inverse transform sampling, we must solve for $x$ from the equation $u = F(x)$, where $u \\in [0, 1]$.\nThe form of the inverse depends on whether $u$ falls into the range corresponding to $x \\le c$ or $x > c$. The critical value of $u$ that separates these two regimes is $u_c = F(c) = \\frac{c-a}{b-a}$.\n\nCase 1: $0 \\le u \\le u_c$ (corresponds to $a \\le x \\le c$)\n$$\nu = \\frac{(x-a)^2}{(b-a)(c-a)} \\\\\n(x-a)^2 = u(b-a)(c-a) \\\\\nx-a = \\sqrt{u(b-a)(c-a)} \\quad (\\text{positive root since } x \\ge a) \\\\\nx = a + \\sqrt{u(b-a)(c-a)}\n$$\n\nCase 2: $u_c  u \\le 1$ (corresponds to $c  x \\le b$)\n$$\nu = 1 - \\frac{(b-x)^2}{(b-a)(b-c)} \\\\\n(b-x)^2 = (1-u)(b-a)(b-c) \\\\\nb-x = \\sqrt{(1-u)(b-a)(b-c)} \\quad (\\text{positive root since } x \\le b) \\\\\nx = b - \\sqrt{(1-u)(b-a)(b-c)}\n$$\n\nThe resulting quantile function $F^{-1}(u)$ is:\n$$\nF^{-1}(u) = \\begin{cases}\na + \\sqrt{u (b-a) (c-a)}  \\text{if } 0 \\le u \\le \\frac{c-a}{b-a} \\\\\nb - \\sqrt{(1-u) (b-a) (b-c)}  \\text{if } \\frac{c-a}{b-a}  u \\le 1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis single, unified formulation is robust and correctly handles the edge cases.\n- If $c=a$, then $u_c = \\frac{c-a}{b-a} = 0$. The condition $0 \\le u \\le 0$ is only true for $u=0$. For any $u > 0$, the second branch is used: $x = b - \\sqrt{(1-u) (b-a) (b-a)} = b - (b-a)\\sqrt{1-u}$. This corresponds to a right triangle with its peak at $a$.\n- If $c=b$, then $u_c = \\frac{c-a}{b-a} = 1$. The condition $0 \\le u \\le 1$ holds for all $u$, so the first branch is always used: $x = a + \\sqrt{u (b-a) (b-a)} = a + (b-a)\\sqrt{u}$. This corresponds to a right triangle with its peak at $b$.\n\nThe derivation is complete and sound.

Frequently in science and engineering, we work not with an analytical formula but with empirical data, often summarized in a histogram. This exercise demonstrates the power of inverse transform sampling by guiding you to build a sampler from a histogram, approximating the underlying distribution as piecewise uniform. Mastering this technique provides a robust tool for simulating complex systems based on observed data [@problem_id:2403898].", "problem": "You are given a histogram summary of empirical data in the form of bin edges and bin counts. Assume within each bin that the underlying probability density is uniform, so that the resulting cumulative distribution function (CDF) is piecewise linear. Using the principle of inverse transform sampling, construct a sampler that maps uniform random numbers into samples from the piecewise-uniform distribution implied by the histogram. Then, validate your sampler by comparing empirical statistics of generated samples with the corresponding analytical values implied by the histogram model.\n\nFundamental base and definitions to be used:\n- The cumulative distribution function $F(x)$ of a real-valued random variable $X$ is defined by $F(x) = \\mathbb{P}(X \\le x)$.\n- If $U$ is uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$ and $F$ is a continuous and strictly increasing CDF, then $X = F^{-1}(U)$ has CDF $F$ (inverse transform sampling). For a piecewise linear $F$, the inverse $F^{-1}$ is computed on each linear segment by inverting the corresponding affine map.\n- For a histogram characterized by bin edges $x_0  x_1  \\dots  x_N$ and nonnegative counts $c_0,\\dots,c_{N-1}$ with total $C = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} c_i  0$, define bin probabilities $p_i = c_i / C$.

Implement a function that, given bin edges $\\{x_i\\}_{i=0}^N$ and counts $\\{c_i\\}_{i=0}^{N-1}$, constructs the normalized cumulative probability at edges, i.e., $F(x_i) = \\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} p_j$ for $i=0,\\dots,N$, with $F(x_0)=0$ and $F(x_N)=1$.\n2.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information and definitions for a unique and verifiable solution. The underlying principles are standard in probability theory and computational statistics. The tasks are specified with sufficient clarity to permit an unambiguous implementation. Thus, we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to construct and validate an inverse transform sampler for a probability distribution defined by a histogram. The model assumes a piecewise-uniform probability density function (PDF) over the bins of the histogram.\n\nLet the histogram be defined by a set of $N+1$ bin edges $x_0  x_1  \\dots  x_N$ and $N$ corresponding non-negative bin counts $c_0, c_1, \\dots, c_{N-1}$. The total number of observations is $C = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} c_i$, which is given to be greater than $0$.\n\nFirst, we normalize the counts to obtain bin probabilities $p_i = c_i / C$ for $i=0, \\dots, N-1$. The model assumes that within each bin $[x_i, x_{i+1}]$, the probability density is uniform. The PDF, $f(x)$, is therefore piecewise constant:\n$$\nf(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{p_i}{x_{i+1} - x_i}  \\text{if } x \\in [x_i, x_{i+1}) \\text{ and } p_i  0 \\\\\n0  \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe cumulative distribution function (CDF), $F(x) = \\mathbb{P}(X \\le x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{x} f(\\xi) d\\xi$, is a continuous and piecewise-linear function. The value of the CDF at each bin edge $x_i$ is the sum of probabilities of all preceding bins:\n$$\nF(x_i) = \\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} p_j\n$$\nFor any point $x$ within a bin $[x_i, x_{i+1}]$, the CDF is given by linear interpolation:\n$$\nF(x) = F(x_i) + p_i \\cdot \\frac{x - x_i}{x_{i+1} - x_i}\n$$\nNote that if a bin $i$ has zero count ($c_i=0$, so $p_i=0$), the CDF is flat across that bin, i.e., $F(x) = F(x_i)$ for all $x \\in [x_i, x_{i+1}]$.\n\nThe core of the task is to implement the inverse transform sampling method. This method relies on the property that if $U$ is a random variable uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$, then $X = F^{-1}(U)$ is a random variable with CDF $F$. The inverse CDF, $F^{-1}(u)$, for $u \\in [0,1]$, is found by inverting the expression for $F(x)$. For a given probability $u \\in [F(x_i), F(x_{i+1}))$ corresponding to a bin $i$ with $p_i > 0$, the inverse is:\n$$\nF^{-1}(u) = x_i + (x_{i+1} - x_i)\\,\\frac{u - F(x_i)}{p_i}\n$$\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1.  **Pre-computation:** Given the lists of bin edges and counts, we first compute the array of bin probabilities $\\{p_i\\}_{i=0}^{N-1}$. Then, we compute the array of cumulative probabilities at the bin edges, denoted `cum_probs`, where `cum_probs[i]` $= F(x_i)$ for $i=0,\\dots,N$. This array has length $N+1$, with `cum_probs[0]`$=0$ and `cum_probs[N]`$=1$.\n2.  **Sampling:** To generate a set of $M$ samples:\n    a. Draw $M$ independent random numbers $\\{u_k\\}_{k=1}^M$ from the uniform distribution $U[0, 1)$.\n    b. For each $u_k$, determine the bin index $i$ such that $F(x_i) \\le u_k  F(x_{i+1})$. This search is efficiently performed for all $u_k$ in a vectorized manner using a binary search algorithm, such as `numpy.searchsorted(cum_probs, u, side='right')`, which gives the index of the a bin edge, from which the bin index $i$ is derived. This procedure naturally handles bins with zero probability, as the search will skip over flat regions of the CDF.\n    c. Apply the inverse CDF formula for each $u_k$ using its identified bin index $i$ to compute the sample $x_k = F^{-1}(u_k)$. This step is also vectorized for efficiency.\n3.  **Analytical Computations:**\n    - **Expected Value:** The analytical mean, $\\mathbb{E}[X]$, is the sum of the expected values over each bin, weighted by their probabilities. For a uniform distribution on $[x_i, x_{i+1}]$, the mean is $(x_i + x_{i+1})/2$. Thus,\n      $$ \\mathbb{E}[X] = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} p_i \\cdot \\frac{x_i + x_{i+1}}{2} $$\n    - **CDF at a Threshold $t$**: To compute $F(t)$, one first finds the bin index $k$ such that $x_k \\le t  x_{k+1}$. Then the piecewise-linear formula for $F(x)$ is applied. The edge cases $t \\le x_0$ and $t \\ge x_N$ result in $F(t)=0$ and $F(t)=1$, respectively.\n    - **Quantile at a Probability $q$**: To compute $F^{-1}(q)$, one finds the bin index $i$ such that $F(x_i) \\le q  F(x_{i+1})$ and then applies the inverse formula.\n4.  **Empirical Computations from Samples:**\n    - **Empirical Mean $\\hat{\\mu}$:** The arithmetic average of the $M$ generated samples.\n    - **Empirical CDF $\\hat{F}(t)$:** The fraction of the $M$ samples that are less than or equal to the threshold $t$.\n    - **Empirical Quantile $\\hat{Q}_7(q)$:** Computed from the sorted samples using the Hyndman-Fan type $7$ definition, which corresponds to linear interpolation between order statistics. This is available in `numpy.quantile` with `interpolation='linear'`.\n5.  **Validation:** For each test case defined in the problem, the sampler generates $M$ samples using a specified random seed. The analytical values for the mean, CDF at $t$, and quantile at $q$ are computed. These are compared against their empirical counterparts calculated from the generated samples. The absolute errors between the analytical and empirical values are the final result.\n\nThe provided Python code implements this entire procedure.
