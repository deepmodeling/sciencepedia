The provided algorithm is standard, and the test cases are scientifically sound and verifiable. The minor notational inconsistency in Test Case 3's particle indexing is interpreted as a typographical error that does not impede a rigorous solution.\n\nThe solution will be constructed based on the following principles and algorithmic steps.\n\n**Fundamental Principles**\n\n1.  **Periodic Space**: A simulation cell is defined by a $3 \\times 3$ matrix $\\mathbf{h}$, whose columns are the lattice vectors $[\\mathbf{a}_1, \\mathbf{a}_2, \\mathbf{a}_3]$. The space is periodic, meaning a particle at Cartesian position $\\mathbf{r}$ has periodic images at all locations $\\mathbf{r} + \\mathbf{h}\\mathbf{n}$ for any integer vector $\\mathbf{n} \\in \\mathbb{Z}^3$.\n\n2.  **Fractional Coordinates**: The geometry of the periodic cell is most naturally described using fractional coordinates $\\mathbf{s} \\in [0, 1)^3$. A position $\\mathbf{s}$ is mapped to its Cartesian equivalent $\\mathbf{r}$ via the linear transformation $\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{h}\\mathbf{s}$. The inverse transformation is $\\mathbf{s} = \\mathbf{h}^{-1}\\mathbf{r}$.\n\n3.  **Minimum Image Convention (MIC)**: The distance between two particles $i$ and $j$ is the minimum Euclidean distance among all periodic images of one particle relative to the other. This distance is given by $d_{ij} = \\min_{\\mathbf{n} \\in \\mathbb{Z}^3} \\| (\\mathbf{r}_j + \\mathbf{h}\\mathbf{n}) - \\mathbf{r}_i \\|$.\n\n**Algorithmic Implementation**\n\nThe MIC distance is computed efficiently by transforming the displacement vector into fractional coordinates and wrapping it into the central periodic image, which is the Wigner-Seitz cell of the lattice. For a general triclinic cell, this is simplified by wrapping each fractional component into the range $[-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows for each pair of particles $(i, j)$:\n\n1.  **Cartesian Displacement**: Compute the \"naive\" displacement vector in Cartesian coordinates, $\\Delta\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{r}_j - \\mathbf{r}_i$.\n\n2.  **Fractional Displacement**: Convert this displacement to fractional coordinates using the inverse cell matrix: $\\Delta\\mathbf{s} = \\mathbf{h}^{-1}\\Delta\\mathbf{r}$.\n\n3.  **Wrapping**: Center the fractional displacement vector. Each component $\\Delta s_k$ of $\\Delta\\mathbf{s}$ is mapped to the interval $[-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$ using the operation $\\Delta s'_k = \\Delta s_k - \\lfloor \\Delta s_k + \\frac{1}{2} \\rfloor$. This wrapping operation correctly selects the nearest periodic image.\n\n4.  **Minimum Image Displacement**: Transform the wrapped fractional displacement $\\Delta\\mathbf{s}'$ back to Cartesian coordinates to obtain the minimum image displacement vector: $\\Delta\\mathbf{r}_{\\text{MIC}} = \\mathbf{h}\\Delta\\mathbf{s}'$.\n\n5.  **Distance Calculation**: The MIC distance is the Euclidean norm $d_{ij} = \\|\\Delta\\mathbf{r}_{\\text{MIC}}\\|$. For efficiency, we compute the squared distance $d_{ij}^2 = \\Delta\\mathbf{r}_{\\text{MIC}} \\cdot \\Delta\\mathbf{r}_{\\text{MIC}}$ and compare it to the squared cutoff distance $r_c^2$.\n\n6.  **Neighbor List Construction**: If $d_{ij}^2 \\le r_c^2$, particle $j$ is added to the neighbor list of particle $i$, and particle $i$ is added to the neighbor list of particle $j$.\n\nThis algorithm will be systematically applied to each test case. The particle positions are first ensured to be in Cartesian coordinates. For test cases where fractional coordinates are given, they are converted using $\\mathbf{r}_i = \\mathbf{h}\\mathbf{s}_i$. The computed neighbor lists for all particles are then compared to the expected lists. The result for a test case is `True` if and only if all computed lists exactly match the expected lists (after ensuring a canonical ordering, such as sorting).

This practice bridges physics and performance by asking you to develop a model that optimizes this update frequency [@problem_id:3177610]. You will use principles like the equipartition theorem to estimate particle motion and derive an optimal rebuild period that balances the cost of updating the list against the force errors introduced by using a stale one.", "problem": "You are tasked with designing a simple, principled optimizer for the neighbor list rebuild period in a molecular dynamics simulation.

It outlines a principled, albeit simplified, model to determine the optimal frequency for rebuilding neighbor lists. The model balances the computational cost of rebuilding against the numerical error incurred by using a stale list. All physical assumptions and mathematical formulas provided are standard or are reasonable approximations within the context of introductory MD. The problem is self-contained, well-posed, and scientifically grounded. We shall now proceed with a systematic derivation of the solution based on the provided framework.\n\nThe objective is to find an optimal integer rebuild period, denoted $n_{\\mathrm{steps}}$, for a neighbor list in a three-dimensional system of particles interacting via a Lennard-Jones potential. The system is characterized by a number density $\\rho$, temperature $T$, and particle mass $m$. The simulation uses a time step $\\Delta t$. The neighbor list is constructed using a cutoff radius $r_c$ and a buffer region or \"skin\" of thickness $r_{\\mathrm{skin}}$. The optimization must satisfy a constraint on the average per-particle force error, which must not exceed a tolerance $\\varepsilon_f$, while also adhering to a maximum practical rebuild period $n_{\\mathrm{cap}}$. All quantities are given in reduced Lennard-Jones units, where the energy scale is $\\epsilon=1$, the length scale is $\\sigma=1$, and Boltzmann’s constant is $k_B=1$.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in three main stages: first, we model the physical process leading to force errors; second, we formalize the error constraint; and third, we solve for the optimal number of steps that satisfies this constraint while minimizing computational cost.\n\n**1. Modeling Particle Displacement and Force Error**\n\nThe primary source of error when using a fixed neighbor list is the motion of particles. A particle initially outside the neighbor list radius, $r_c + r_{\\mathrm{skin}}$, may move to within the interaction cutoff $r_c$ during the $n_{\\mathrm{steps}}$ between rebuilds. Such an event leads to a \"missed\" interaction, resulting in a force calculation error.\n\nTo quantify this, we first estimate the typical speed of particles. From the equipartition theorem in three dimensions, the average kinetic energy per particle is $\\frac{3}{2} k_B T$. In reduced units where the particle mass $m$ and $k_B=1$ are specified, the root-mean-square (RMS) speed $v_{\\mathrm{rms}}$ is:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{rms}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3 k_B T}{m}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3T}{m}}$$\nThe rate at which two particles approach or separate is given by their relative velocity. For two particles with uncorrelated velocities drawn from the same distribution, the RMS relative speed can be approximated as:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{rel,rms}} = \\sqrt{2} \\, v_{\\mathrm{rms}} = \\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{3T}{m}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{6T}{m}}$$\nOver a period of $n$ steps of duration $\\Delta t$, we use a linear approximation for the RMS relative displacement between a pair of particles:\n$$\\Delta r_{\\mathrm{rel}}(n) \\approx v_{\\mathrm{rel,rms}} \\, n \\, \\Delta t$$\nIf this displacement exceeds the skin thickness, $\\Delta r_{\\mathrm{rel}} > r_{\\mathrm{skin}}$, there is a possibility of a missed interaction. We define the \"excess approach distance\" $e$ as the amount by which the relative displacement encroaches into the region protected by the skin:\n$$e = \\max(0, \\Delta r_{\\mathrm{rel}} - r_{\\mathrm{skin}})$$\n\n**2. Formalizing the Force Error Constraint**\n\nThe average number of missed neighbor interactions per particle, $N_{\\mathrm{miss}}$, can be estimated by considering the number of particles that are expected to enter the interaction sphere of a central particle. These particles originate from a spherical shell of radius $r_c$ and thickness $e$. For a system with uniform number density $\\rho$, the volume of this shell is approximately $4 \\pi r_c^2 e$. Thus, the expected number of missed neighbors is:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{miss}} \\approx \\rho \\, 4 \\pi r_c^2 \\, e$$\nTo estimate the resulting force error, we assume that the missed interaction force for each such pair is approximately equal to the force magnitude at the cutoff distance, $|F_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r_c)|$. The total average per-particle force error $E_f(n)$ is then the product of the number of missed neighbors and this characteristic force magnitude:\n$$E_f(n) \\approx N_{\\mathrm{miss}} \\, |F_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r_c)| = (\\rho \\, 4 \\pi r_c^2 \\, e) \\, |F_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r_c)|$$\nThe Lennard-Jones force magnitude in reduced units ($\\epsilon=1, \\sigma=1$) is given by:\n$$|F_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r)| = \\left| 24 \\left( \\frac{2}{r^{13}} - \\frac{1}{r^{7}} \\right) \\right|$$\nThe problem imposes the constraint that this estimated error must not exceed a specified tolerance $\\varepsilon_f$:\n$$E_f(n) \\le \\varepsilon_f$$\nSubstituting the expression for $E_f(n)$ and solving for the excess distance $e$ gives the maximum permissible excess approach, $e_{\\max}$:\n$$(\\rho \\, 4 \\pi r_c^2 \\, e_{\\max}) \\, |F_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r_c)| = \\varepsilon_f \\implies e_{\\max} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_f}{\\rho \\, 4 \\pi r_c^2 \\, |F_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r_c)|}$$\nIf $|F_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r_c)| = 0$, the denominator is zero. In this physically specific case (where the cutoff is at the force minimum), the estimated force error is zero regardless of missed neighbors, so $e_{\\max}$ can be considered infinite.\n\n**3. Deriving the Optimal Rebuild Period**\n\nThe constraint on $e \\le e_{\\max}$ implies a constraint on the total relative displacement. From $e = \\Delta r_{\\mathrm{rel}} - r_{\\mathrm{skin}}$, we must have $\\Delta r_{\\mathrm{rel}} - r_{\\mathrm{skin}} \\le e_{\\max}$, which rearranges to:\n$$\\Delta r_{\\mathrm{rel}} \\le r_{\\mathrm{skin}} + e_{\\max}$$\nSubstituting our model for displacement, $\\Delta r_{\\mathrm{rel}}(n) \\approx v_{\\mathrm{rel,rms}} \\, n \\, \\Delta t$, gives the constraint on the number of steps $n$:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{rel,rms}} \\, n \\, \\Delta t \\le r_{\\mathrm{skin}} + e_{\\max}$$\nSolving for $n$ yields the maximum number of steps allowed by the error tolerance:\n$$n \\le \\frac{r_{\\mathrm{skin}} + e_{\\max}}{v_{\\mathrm{rel,rms}} \\, \\Delta t}$$\nSince $n$ must be an integer, the largest integer value satisfying this inequality is found by taking the floor of the right-hand side. We denote this value $n_{\\max}$:\n$$n_{\\max} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{r_{\\mathrm{skin}} + e_{\\max}}{v_{\\mathrm{rel,rms}} \\, \\Delta t} \\right\\rfloor$$\nIf the denominator $v_{\\mathrm{rel,rms}} \\, \\Delta t = 0$ (e.g., at zero temperature), particles are stationary, so no rebuilds are needed to correct for motion. In this case, $n_{\\max}$ can be considered infinite.\n\nThe computational cost model is given as an amortized cost per step: $C_{\\mathrm{step}}(n) = C_{\\mathrm{pair}} + C_{\\mathrm{rebuild}}/n$. To minimize this cost, we must maximize $n$. Therefore, the optimal choice for $n$ under the error constraint is precisely $n_{\\max}$.\n\nFinally, we must incorporate the practical constraints that the rebuild period must be at least $1$ step and no more than the engineering cap $n_{\\mathrm{cap}}$. Combining these, the final expression for the optimal rebuild period is:\n$$n_{\\mathrm{steps}} = \\max\\left(1, \\min\\left(n_{\\max}, n_{\\mathrm{cap}}\\right)\\right)$$\nThis formula represents the complete algorithm for determining the optimal neighbor list rebuild period according to the specified model. For each test case, we will compute the quantities in the specified order to arrive at the final integer $n_{\\mathrm{steps}}$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the optimal neighbor list rebuild period for a series of test cases\n    based on a principled model for molecular dynamics simulations.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each tuple is (rho, T, m, dt, r_c, r_skin, eps_f, n_cap)\n    test_cases = [\n        (0.8, 1.0, 1.0, 0.005, 2.5, 0.3, 0.05, 100),\n        (0.8, 1.0, 1.0, 0.005, 2.5, 0.05, 0.05, 100),\n        (0.8, 0.2, 1.0, 0.005, 2.5, 0.3, 0.05, 100),\n        (0.8, 1.0, 1.0, 0.005, 2.5, 0.3, 0.0, 100),\n        (0.8, 0.05, 1.0, 0.005, 2.5, 0.3, 0.5, 100),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        rho, T, m, dt, r_c, r_skin, eps_f, n_cap = case\n\n        # Step 1: Compute v_rms and v_rel_rms\n        # v_rms = sqrt(3 * k_B * T / m).

The problem is firmly rooted in the principles of classical mechanics and numerical analysis as applied to molecular simulation.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly stated.

A solution will be derived by analyzing each option based on the first principles of molecular dynamics.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe total energy of a system in an NVE simulation should be conserved. A systematic drift, as opposed to bounded fluctuations, indicates a flaw in the numerical implementation of the theoretically conservative dynamics. This flaw arises from approximations that break the time-reversal symmetry and symplecticity of the integration algorithm or that introduce non-conservative forces. We evaluate each option as a potential source of this energy non-conservation.\n\n**A. The integration time step $\\Delta t$ is too large for the fastest motions remaining after constraining bonds to hydrogens, so discretization error injects energy. Diagnostic: rerun short segments with $\\Delta t$ reduced (e.g., to $\\Delta t = 1\\,\\mathrm{fs}$) and compare the drift rate; a substantial reduction in drift with smaller $\\Delta t$ indicates time-integration error.**\n\nThe velocity Verlet algorithm is a second-order numerical integrator. The local error per step is of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^3)$, and the global error in trajectories over a fixed time interval $T$ is of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^2)$. While the algorithm is symplectic for conservative forces and should exhibit bounded energy fluctuations, a time step that is too large to resolve the fastest characteristic motions of the system leads to resonance artifacts. These resonances can cause a systematic transfer of energy into high-frequency modes, a phenomenon often called numerical heating. Even after constraining the fastest degrees of freedom (H-bond vibrations), other motions like bond-angle vibrations in a protein can have periods on the order of $10-20\\,\\mathrm{fs}$. A time step of $\\Delta t = 2\\,\\mathrm{fs}$ is aggressive and may be too large for stable integration of these modes, thus leading to the accumulation of discretization error and a secular upward drift in total energy. The proposed diagnostic is a standard procedure; if the drift is due to the size of $\\Delta t$, its magnitude should decrease significantly with a smaller time step, typically scaling with a power of $\\Delta t$.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The neighbor list buffer is too small and/or neighbor lists are updated too infrequently with a hard real-space cutoff, producing discontinuous forces when pairs enter the cutoff region, doing spurious work on the system. Diagnostic: increase the neighbor-list skin and update frequency and inspect time series of $U(t)$ for small jumps correlated with neighbor-list rebuilds; reduced jumps and drift implicate cutoff/list artifacts.**\n\nA simple truncation of the potential at a cutoff radius $r_c$ makes the potential energy function non-differentiable and the corresponding force $\\mathbf{F} = -\\nabla U$ discontinuous at $r = r_c$. A discontinuous force is non-conservative, and integrating particle motion under such a force does not conserve energy. A Verlet neighbor list is used for efficiency, where interactions are computed only for pairs within a radius $r_{list} > r_c$. The list is held constant for several time steps. If the update frequency is too low or the \"skin\" thickness ($r_{list} - r_c$) is too small, a pair of particles may cross the cutoff boundary $r_c$ between neighbor list updates. At the next force calculation after crossing, the force on this pair will abruptly appear or disappear, creating an impulse. This leads to a discontinuity in the potential energy and spurious work being done. These events rarely average to zero and typically result in a net increase in kinetic energy, causing the system to heat up. The proposed diagnostic directly tests this hypothesis by making the neighbor list management more conservative (thicker skin, more frequent updates), which should smoothen the effective forces and reduce the energy drift.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Accumulation of center-of-mass (COM) translation in periodic boundaries causes “heating” of internal modes, raising $E_{\\text{tot}}$. Diagnostic: periodically remove COM velocity to eliminate drift in $E_{\\text{tot}}$.**\n\nIn a simulation with no external forces, the total momentum of the system, and thus its COM velocity, should be conserved. However, the summation of forces in finite-precision arithmetic can lead to a small net force, causing the COM velocity to drift from zero. The total kinetic energy $K$ is the sum of the kinetic energy of the COM, $K_{\\text{COM}} = \\frac{1}{2} M_{\\text{tot}} \\mathbf{V}_{\\text{COM}}^2$, and the internal kinetic energy, $K_{\\text{internal}}$. An increase in $\\mathbf{V}_{\\text{COM}}$ directly increases $K_{\\text{COM}}$ and thus $E_{\\text{tot}} = U + K_{\\text{internal}} + K_{\\text{COM}}$. So, COM velocity drift is a plausible cause for a rise in the *reported total energy*. However, the option's explanation that this \"causes 'heating' of internal modes\" is physically incorrect. The COM motion is, to first order, decoupled from the internal degrees of freedom. An increase in $K_{\\text{COM}}$ does not transfer energy to internal modes; in fact, a known artifact in long NVE simulations called the \"flying ice cube\" effect involves the transfer of energy *from* internal modes *to* COM motion, causing the molecule to cool internally. The description of the physical mechanism is flawed. The diagnostic, removing COM velocity, is correct for addressing the drift in $E_{\\text{tot}}$ caused by COM motion, but it addresses the rise in $K_{COM}$, not a fictitious heating of internal modes. Due to the incorrect physical reasoning, this option is not a valid explanation as stated.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The constraint solver tolerance is too loose or the iteration count too low, so constraints are not fully satisfied each step, allowing the solver to do net positive work on the system. Diagnostic: tighten the constraint tolerance by orders of magnitude and/or increase the maximum iterations, and monitor the maximum constraint violation and the drift; a decrease in both indicates constraint-induced drift.**\n\nConstraint algorithms like SHAKE and its velocity-level counterpart RATTLE (which is used with velocity Verlet) are iterative. They apply corrective impulses to satisfy geometric constraints. If the convergence tolerance is too loose or the maximum number of iterations is insufficient, the constraints will not be perfectly satisfied at the end of a time step. The process of applying constraint corrections can do work on the system. While for a perfectly converged solver this work should average to zero, an inaccurate solution can introduce a systematic bias. The errors in satisfying the constraints mean that the constraint forces are not perfectly orthogonal to the particle velocities, leading to net positive or negative work over many steps. This is a well-known source of systematic energy drift. The proposed diagnostic is the standard and correct way to verify this: increasing the accuracy of the constraint solver should reduce the error and the associated energy drift.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. Finite-precision arithmetic (e.g., single precision) biases accumulation of round-off errors into a secular energy increase. Diagnostic: rerun identically in double precision and compare drift; a marked reduction indicates precision-related drift.**\n\nMolecular dynamics simulations involve a massive number of floating-point operations at each time step. While double-precision arithmetic (64-bit) is standard for scientific computing and typically sufficient to keep round-off errors random and non-accumulating, single-precision (32-bit) arithmetic can be problematic. The lower precision can lead to significant loss of accuracy, especially when summing many small numbers (forces) or taking differences of large numbers (in kinetic energy calculation). These round-off errors may not be random and can introduce a systematic bias, effectively acting as a small, non-physical force that does work on the system over time, leading to energy drift. An upward drift is a very possible outcome. The diagnostic is definitive: if running the identical simulation using double-precision arithmetic significantly reduces or eliminates the energy drift, then finite-precision effects were a primary cause.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABDE}$$", "id": "2417125"}]}
