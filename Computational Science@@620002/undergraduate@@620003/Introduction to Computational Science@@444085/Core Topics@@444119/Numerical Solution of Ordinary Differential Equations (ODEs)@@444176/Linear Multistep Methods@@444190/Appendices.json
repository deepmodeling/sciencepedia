The grid points are defined as $t_k = k h$ for a constant step size $h > 0$. The given ordinary differential equation is $y'(t) = f(t, y(t))$, where the function $f$ is independent of $y$ and is given by $f(t) = t^2$.\n\nThe two-step Adams-Bashforth (AB2) method generates the approximation $y_{n+1}$ to the exact solution $y(t_{n+1})$ using the formula:\n$$y_{n+1} = y_n + h \\left( \\frac{3}{2} f_n - \\frac{1}{2} f_{n-1} \\right)$$\nwhere $f_k = f(t_k, y_k)$. For the specific problem given, $f_k = t_k^2$.\n\nThe local truncation error at step $n+1$, denoted $\\tau_{n+1}$, is defined as the difference between the exact one-step increment and the method's predicted increment, assuming all previous values are exact. That is, we assume $y_n = y(t_n)$ and $y_{n-1} = y(t_{n-1})$. The error is thus:\n$$\\tau_{n+1} = \\left( y(t_{n+1}) - y(t_n) \\right) - \\left( y_{n+1} - y_n \\right)$$\nSubstituting the AB2 formula for the numerical increment $(y_{n+1} - y_n)$, we have:\n$$\\tau_{n+1} = \\left( y(t_{n+1}) - y(t_n) \\right) - h \\left( \\frac{3}{2} f(t_n) - \\frac{1}{2} f(t_{n-1}) \\right)$$\nwhere we use $f(t_k)$ since we assume past points lie on the exact solution curve.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation to start from the fundamental identity for the exact increment, which is obtained by integrating the differential equation $y'(s) = f(s)$ from $t_n$ to $t_{n+1}$:\n$$y(t_{n+1}) - y(t_n) = \\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} f(s) \\, ds$$\nFor $f(s) = s^2$, the exact increment is:\n$$y(t_{n+1}) - y(t_n) = \\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} s^2 \\, ds = \\left[ \\frac{s^3}{3} \\right]_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} = \\frac{t_{n+1}^3 - t_n^3}{3}$$\nUsing $t_{n+1} = t_n + h$, we expand the expression:\n$$y(t_{n+1}) - y(t_n) = \\frac{(t_n + h)^3 - t_n^3}{3} = \\frac{(t_n^3 + 3t_n^2h + 3t_nh^2 + h^3) - t_n^3}{3} = t_n^2h + t_nh^2 + \\frac{h^3}{3}$$\n\nNext, we evaluate the numerical increment predicted by the AB2 method.\nThe AB2 increment is $h \\left( \\frac{3}{2} f(t_n) - \\frac{1}{2} f(t_{n-1}) \\right)$. With $f(t) = t^2$, $t_n$, and $t_{n-1} = t_n - h$, this becomes:\n$$\\text{AB2 increment} = h \\left( \\frac{3}{2} t_n^2 - \\frac{1}{2} (t_n - h)^2 \\right)$$\nExpanding the squared term:\n$$\\text{AB2 increment} = h \\left( \\frac{3}{2} t_n^2 - \\frac{1}{2} (t_n^2 - 2t_nh + h^2) \\right) = h \\left( \\frac{3}{2} t_n^2 - \\frac{1}{2} t_n^2 + t_nh - \\frac{1}{2} h^2 \\right)$$\nSimplifying the terms inside the parenthesis:\n$$\\text{AB2 increment} = h \\left( t_n^2 + t_nh - \\frac{1}{2}h^2 \\right) = t_n^2h + t_nh^2 - \\frac{h^3}{2}$$\n\nNow, we compute the local truncation error $\\tau_{n+1}$ by subtracting the numerical increment from the exact increment:\n$$\\tau_{n+1} = \\left( t_n^2h + t_nh^2 + \\frac{h^3}{3} \\right) - \\left( t_n^2h + t_nh^2 - \\frac{h^3}{2} \\right)$$\nThe terms involving $t_n$ cancel out:\n$$\\tau_{n+1} = \\frac{h^3}{3} - \\left(-\\frac{h^3}{2}\\right) = \\frac{h^3}{3} + \\frac{h^3}{2} = \\left(\\frac{2+3}{6}\\right)h^3 = \\frac{5}{6}h^3$$\nThe symbolic expression for the local truncation error is $\\tau_{n+1} = \\frac{5}{6}h^3$. It is noteworthy that for this specific problem, where $y'''(t) = f''(t)$ is a constant, the local truncation error is independent of the grid point $t_n$.\n\nTo verify this result numerically, we use $h = 0.2$ as requested. The symbolic formula gives:\n$$\\tau_{n+1} = \\frac{5}{6}(0.2)^3 = \\frac{5}{6}(0.008) = \\frac{0.04}{6} = \\frac{0.02}{3} \\approx 0.0066666...$$\nLet's confirm this by direct calculation at an arbitrary grid point, for instance $t_n = 1.0$. This implies $t_{n-1} = 0.8$ and $t_{n+1} = 1.2$.\nThe exact increment is:\n$$y(1.2)-y(1.0) = \\int_{1.0}^{1.2} s^2 \\, ds = \\frac{1.2^3 - 1.0^3}{3} = \\frac{1.728 - 1.0}{3} = \\frac{0.728}{3}$$\nThe AB2 increment is:\n$$h \\left( \\frac{3}{2} t_n^2 - \\frac{1}{2} t_{n-1}^2 \\right) = 0.2 \\left( \\frac{3}{2}(1.0)^2 - \\frac{1}{2}(0.8)^2 \\right) = 0.2 \\left( 1.5 - \\frac{1}{2}(0.64) \\right) = 0.2(1.5 - 0.32) = 0.2(1.18) = 0.236$$\nThe numerical error is:\n$$\\tau_{n+1} = \\frac{0.728}{3} - 0.236 = \\frac{0.728 - 3 \\times 0.236}{3} = \\frac{0.728 - 0.708}{3} = \\frac{0.02}{3}$$\nThis numerical computation perfectly matches the result from the symbolic formula. Rounded to five significant figures, the numerical value is $0.0066667$. The fact that the error is proportional to $h^3$ confirms that the method is second-order, which is characteristic of the AB2 method.\nThe final required answer is the symbolic expression for the local truncation error.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{5}{6}h^{3}}$$", "id": "3153704"}, {"introduction": "While local truncation error describes accuracy over a single step, the true measure of a method's performance is its global error across the entire simulation.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information to proceed. The task is to numerically demonstrate the theoretical orders of convergence for the global error and the local truncation error of the $p$-step Adams–Bashforth methods for orders $p=1, 2, 3, 4$. The problem is valid.\n\nThe specified initial value problem (IVP) is given by\n$$\ny^{\\prime}(t) = -y(t), \\quad t \\in [0, 1]\n$$\nwith the initial condition $y(0) = 1$. The function on the right-hand side is $f(t,y) = -y$. The analytical solution to this IVP is known to be $y(t) = e^{-t}$.\n\nThe general form of a $p$-step Adams–Bashforth (AB) method for approximating the solution to an IVP $y^{\\prime} = f(t,y)$ on a uniform grid $t_n = n h$ is\n$$\ny_{n+1} = y_n + h \\sum_{j=0}^{p-1} \\beta_j f(t_{n-j}, y_{n-j})\n$$\nThis formula is applied for $n \\geq p-1$. The method requires $p$ starting values, $y_0, y_1, \\dots, y_{p-1}$. The problem dictates that these shall be taken from the exact solution, i.e., $y_k = y(t_k) = e^{-kh}$ for $k=0, 1, \\dots, p-1$.

First, the global error at the final time $t=1$. This is defined as $E(h) = \\lvert y_N - y(1)\\rvert$, where $N=1/h$, $y_N$ is the numerical approximation at $t_N=1$, and $y(1)=e^{-1}$ is the exact value. A $p$-step AB method is known to have a global error of order $p$, so we expect $E(h) \\propto h^p$.\n\nSecond, we analyze the local one-step residual, which is defined by substituting the exact solution $y(t)$ into the one-step formula:\n$$\nr_{n+1} \\equiv y(t_{n+1}) - y(t_n) - h \\sum_{j=0}^{p-1} \\beta_j f(t_{n-j}, y(t_{n-j}))\n$$\nThe problem defines the measure of the local truncation error as $R(h) = \\max_{n=p-1,\\dots,N-1} \\lvert r_{n+1}\\rvert$. For a $p$-step AB method, this residual is theoretically of order $p+1$, meaning $r_{n+1} = O(h^{p+1})$. Consequently, we expect to observe $R(h) \\propto h^{p+1}$. Note that this is distinct from the standard definition of local truncation error, which is $T_{n+1} = r_{n+1}/h$ and would be of order $p$. The problem is self-consistent in its definition.\n\nTo numerically verify these orders of convergence, we assume the relationships $E(h) \\approx C_g h^{g_p}$ and $R(h) \\approx C_l h^{\\ell_p}$, where $g_p$ and $\\ell_p$ are the observed orders of convergence for a method of order $p$. By taking the natural logarithm, we obtain linear relationships:\n$$\n\\log(E(h)) \\approx \\log(C_g) + g_p \\log(h)\n$$\n$$\n\\log(R(h)) \\approx \\log(C_l) + \\ell_p \\log(h)\n$$\nFor each fixed $p$, we compute the values of $E(h)$ and $R(h)$ for the set of step sizes $h \\in \\{1/8, 1/16, 1/32, 1/64\\}$. We then perform a linear regression on the sets of points $(\\log(h), \\log(E(h)))$ and $(\\log(h), \\log(R(h)))$. The slopes of these best-fit lines provide the estimates for the observed orders, $g_p$ and $\\ell_p$, respectively. The slope $m$ of a best-fit line for a set of points $(x_i, y_i)$ is calculated using the formula from least squares regression:\n$$\nm = \\frac{M \\sum_{i=1}^M x_i y_i - (\\sum_{i=1}^M x_i)(\\sum_{i=1}^M y_i)}{M \\sum_{i=1}^M x_i^2 - (\\sum_{i=1}^M x_i)^2}\n$$\nwhere $M=4$ is the number of data points corresponding to the four step sizes.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows: for each order $p \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, we iterate through the given step sizes $h$. For each $h$, we compute the numerical solution up to $t=1$ to find $E(h)$, and we compute the set of residuals $\\{r_{n+1}\\}$ to find $R(h)$. After collecting the data for all step sizes, we compute the slopes $g_p$ and $\\ell_p$.

By convention, $\\alpha_k=1$. The stability of a method for stiff equations is analyzed by applying it to the test equation $y' = \\lambda y$, where $f_n = \\lambda y_n$.\n\n### Task 1: Analysis of the Second-Order Adams–Moulton (AM2) Method\n\nThe AM2 method, also known as the trapezoidal rule, is a one-step ($k=1$) implicit method. Its formula is given by:\n$$ y_{n+1} - y_n = \\frac{h}{2} (f_{n+1} + f_n) $$\nFor the test equation $y'=\\lambda y$, this becomes:\n$$ y_{n+1} - y_n = \\frac{h}{2} (\\lambda y_{n+1} + \\lambda y_n) $$\nTo derive the update relation, we solve for $y_{n+1}$:\n$$ y_{n+1} - \\frac{h\\lambda}{2} y_{n+1} = y_n + \\frac{h\\lambda}{2} y_n $$\n$$ y_{n+1} \\left(1 - \\frac{h\\lambda}{2}\\right) = y_n \\left(1 + \\frac{h\\lambda}{2}\\right) $$\nLet $z = h\\lambda$ be the stiffness ratio. The update relation is $y_{n+1} = R_{\\text{AM2}}(z) y_n$, where the amplification factor $R_{\\text{AM2}}(z)$ is:\n$$ R_{\\text{AM2}}(z) = \\frac{1 + z/2}{1 - z/2} $$\nTo analyze the behavior for stiff decay, we examine the limit of this amplification factor as $z \\to -\\infty$ (since $\\lambda$ is large and negative, and $h0$).\n$$ \\lim_{z \\to -\\infty} R_{\\text{AM2}}(z) = \\lim_{z \\to -\\infty} \\frac{1 + z/2}{1 - z/2} = \\lim_{z \\to -\\infty} \\frac{z(1/z + 1/2)}{z(1/z - 1/2)} = \\frac{0 + 1/2}{0 - 1/2} = -1 $$\nThis result is critically important. For highly stiff problems (large negative $z$), each step of the AM2 method multiplies the solution by approximately $-1$. This means the numerical solution $|y_n|$ does not decay to zero; instead, it oscillates with a nearly constant magnitude ($y_{n+1} \\approx -y_n$). The exact solution $y(t) = e^{\\lambda t}$ decays to zero extremely rapidly for large negative $\\lambda$. Therefore, AM2 fails to capture the qualitative behavior of stiff decay, making it unsuitable for such problems. This property, where the amplification factor approaches $-1$ but not $0$ at infinity, characterizes A-stable but not L-stable methods.\n\n### Task 2: Analysis of the Second-Order Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF2) Method\n\nThe BDF2 method is a two-step ($k=2$) implicit method. Its standard form is:\n$$ y_{n+1} - \\frac{4}{3} y_n + \\frac{1}{3} y_{n-1} = \\frac{2}{3} h f_{n+1} $$\nApplying this to the test equation $y' = \\lambda y$, where $f_{n+1} = \\lambda y_{n+1}$, we obtain:\n$$ y_{n+1} - \\frac{4}{3} y_n + \\frac{1}{3} y_{n-1} = \\frac{2}{3} h \\lambda y_{n+1} $$\nLet $z=h\\lambda$. Rearranging the terms yields the requested homogeneous linear recurrence relation:\n$$ \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3}z\\right) y_{n+1} - \\frac{4}{3} y_n + \\frac{1}{3} y_{n-1} = 0 $$\nTo analyze the stability, we seek solutions of the form $y_n = \\xi^n$. Substituting this into the recurrence gives the characteristic polynomial for the amplification factor $\\xi$:\n$$ \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3}z\\right) \\xi^2 - \\frac{4}{3} \\xi + \\frac{1}{3} = 0 $$\nWe are interested in the behavior of the roots $\\xi$ of this polynomial as $z \\to -\\infty$. The solution of the recurrence is a linear combination of terms involving the roots. For stability, all roots must have magnitude less than or equal to $1$. For stiff decay, the magnitudes of the roots should go to $0$ as $z \\to -\\infty$.\n\nLet's analyze the roots. As $z \\to -\\infty$, the coefficient of $\\xi^2$, which is $(1 - \\frac{2}{3}z)$, becomes very large. We can investigate the roots using Vieta's formulas. Let the roots be $\\xi_1$ and $\\xi_2$.\n$$ \\xi_1 + \\xi_2 = \\frac{4/3}{1 - 2z/3} $$\n$$ \\xi_1 \\xi_2 = \\frac{1/3}{1 - 2z/3} $$\nAs $z \\to -\\infty$, both the sum and the product of the roots approach $0$. This implies that both roots themselves must approach $0$. More formally, let's solve the quadratic equation and analyze the roots in the limit $z \\to -\\infty$:\n$$ \\xi^2 - \\frac{4/3}{1-2z/3} \\xi + \\frac{1/3}{1-2z/3} = 0 $$\nThe roots are $\\xi = \\frac{a \\pm \\sqrt{a^2 - 4b}}{2}$, where $a = \\frac{4/3}{1-2z/3}$ and $b = \\frac{1/3}{1-2z/3}$.\nAs $z \\to -\\infty$, $a \\sim \\frac{4/3}{-2z/3} = -2/z$ and $b \\sim \\frac{1/3}{-2z/3} = -1/(2z)$. The term $a^2 \\sim 4/z^2$ is negligible compared to $-4b \\sim 2/z$. Let $z = -|z|$.\n$$ \\sqrt{a^2-4b} \\approx \\sqrt{-4b} = \\sqrt{2/|z|} $$\nThis approximation is valid for large $|z|$. The roots are thus approximately:\n$$ \\xi \\approx \\frac{-2/z \\pm \\sqrt{-2/z}}{2} = -1/z \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{-2/z} $$\nAs $z \\to -\\infty$, we have $|-1/z| \\to 0$ and $|\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{-2/z}| \\to 0$. Therefore, the magnitudes of both amplification factors tend to zero:\n$$ \\lim_{z \\to -\\infty} |\\xi(z)| = 0 $$\nThis property is known as L-stability. It means that for very stiff problems, the BDF2 method strongly damps the numerical solution, forcing it toward zero. This correctly mimics the behavior of the exact solution $y(t) = e^{\\lambda t}$ and makes BDF2 highly effective for stiff decay capture.\n\n### Tasks 3 and 4: Implementation and Metric Calculation\n\nThe implementation follows directly from the derived recurrence relations.\n\nFor AM2, starting with $y_0 = 1$, we iterate $y_{n+1} = R_{\\text{AM2}}(z) y_n$ for $N=T/h$ steps to find $y_N$.\n\nFor BDF2, we are given starting values $y_0 = 1$ and $y_1 = e^{\\lambda h}$. We then iterate the recurrence $y_{n+1} = \\frac{4/3 y_n - 1/3 y_{n-1}}{1-2z/3}$ for $n=1, \\dots, N-1$ to find $y_N$.\n\nThe stiff-decay-capture metric $M$ for each method is calculated as:\n$$ M = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{|y_N|}{|e^{\\lambda T}|}\\right) $$\nwhere $y_N$ is the numerical solution at the final time $T$. A value of $M$ near $0$ indicates that the numerical solution decays at a rate comparable to the exact solution, signifying good performance. A large positive $M$ indicates the numerical solution has failed to decay appropriately. Based on our analysis, we expect $M_{\\text{AM2}}$ to be large and positive for stiff cases, while $M_{\\text{BDF2}}$ should remain close to $0$.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the given problem by comparing AM2 and BDF2 methods\n    on a stiff test equation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # (lambda, h, T)\n    test_cases = [\n        (-50.0, 0.1, 1.0),\n        (-1000.0, 0.05, 0.5),\n        (-2.0, 0.1, 1.0),\n        (-4000.0, 0.05, 0.1),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n\n    for lam, h, T in test_cases:\n        N = int(round(T / h))\n        z = h * lam\n\n        # --- AM2 Solver ---\n        # y_n+1 = R(z) * y_n, where R(z) = (1+z/2)/(1-z/2)\n        # y_N = R(z)^N * y_0\n        y_0_am2 = 1.0\n        # The denominator can be zero if z=2, but problem constraints have z  0.\n        R_am2 = (1.0 + z / 2.0) / (1.0 - z / 2.0)\n        y_N_am2 = (R_am2 ** N) * y_0_am2\n\n        # --- BDF2 Solver ---\n        # (1 - 2z/3)y_n+1 - (4/3)y_n + (1/3)y_n-1 = 0\n        # y_n+1 = ( (4/3)y_n - (1/3)y_n-1 ) / (1 - 2z/3)\n        y_0_bdf2 = 1.0\n        y_1_bdf2 = np.exp(lam * h)\n        \n        y_prev = y_0_bdf2\n        y_curr = y_1_bdf2\n        \n        if N == 0:\n            y_N_bdf2 = y_prev\n        elif N == 1:\n            y_N_bdf2 = y_curr\n        else:\n            # This handles N=2.\n            for _ in range(N - 1):\n                y_next = ( (4.0/3.0) * y_curr - (1.0/3.0) * y_prev ) / (1.0 - (2.0/3.0) * z)\n                y_prev = y_curr\n                y_curr = y_next\n            y_N_bdf2 = y_curr\n\n        # --- Metric Calculation (Task 4) ---\n        # M = log10( |y_numerical(T)| / |y_exact(T)| )\n        # Using np.exp for precision with large negative exponents.\n        exact_sol_at_T = np.exp(lam * T)\n\n        # The exact solution is always positive, so abs is for formality.\n        # The numerical solution can be negative.\n        M_am2 = np.log10(np.abs(y_N_am2) / np.abs(exact_sol_at_T))\n        M_bdf2 = np.log10(np.abs(y_N_bdf2) / np.abs(exact_sol_at_T))\n        \n        results.append([f\"{M_am2:.6f}\", f\"{M_bdf2:.6f}\"])\n\n    # --- Format final output ---\n    output_str = \"[\" + \",\".join([f\"[{m_am2},{m_bdf2}]\" for m_am2, m_bdf2 in results]) + \"]\"\n    # A small adjustment in the provided python code to handle floating point arithmetic for N\n    # in the test cases and avoid potential errors.
