It is well-posed, providing a clear definition of scaled speedup and sufficient numerical data ($S(N)$ and $N$) to solve for the unknown variable $\\alpha$. The terminology is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any fundamental principles, is not incomplete or contradictory, and presents a solvable, non-trivial challenge within the field of computational science.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived from first principles as stipulated.\n\n### Derivation\nLet $T(N)$ be the total wall-clock time for a job running on $N$ processors. The problem states this time is held fixed. For convenience and without loss of generality, we can normalize this time to $T(N)=1$ unit.\n\nAccording to the problem definition, $\\alpha$ is the fraction of the total run time on the parallel machine ($N$ processors) that is spent in the serial portion.\nThe time spent on the serial portion on $N$ processors is:\n$$T_{\\text{serial}, N} = \\alpha T(N)$$\nThe remaining time is spent on the parallelizable portion:\n$$T_{\\text{parallel}, N} = (1 - \\alpha) T(N)$$\nThe sum is $T_{\\text{serial}, N} + T_{\\text{parallel}, N} = \\alpha T(N) + (1-\\alpha)T(N) = T(N)$, which is consistent.\n\nNext, we must determine the time it would take a single processor ($N=1$) to execute this same scaled workload. Let this time be $T(1)$. The workload consists of a serial part and a parallel part.\n\nThe serial part of the workload is, by definition, not parallelizable. Therefore, the time to execute it is independent of the number of processors. The time for the serial part on one processor is the same as the time for the serial part on $N$ processors.\n$$T_{\\text{serial}, 1} = T_{\\text{serial}, N} = \\alpha T(N)$$\n\nThe parallel part of the workload is perfectly parallelizable. When running on $N$ processors, the work is distributed among them, taking time $T_{\\text{parallel}, N}$. If this same amount of parallel work were to be executed on a single processor, it would take $N$ times as long.\n$$T_{\\text{parallel}, 1} = N \\cdot T_{\\text{parallel}, N} = N(1 - \\alpha) T(N)$$\n\nThe total time for the single processor, $T(1)$, is the sum of the times for its serial and parallel parts:\n$$T(1) = T_{\\text{serial}, 1} + T_{\\text{parallel}, 1}$$\n$$T(1) = \\alpha T(N) + N(1 - \\alpha) T(N)$$\nFactoring out $T(N)$, we get:\n$$T(1) = [\\alpha + N(1 - \\alpha)] T(N)$$\n\nThe problem defines the scaled speedup, $S(N)$, as the ratio of the time a single processor would require ($T(1)$) to the time $N$ processors actually take ($T(N)$).\n$$S(N) = \\frac{T(1)}{T(N)}$$\nSubstituting our expression for $T(1)$:\n$$S(N) = \\frac{[\\alpha + N(1 - \\alpha)] T(N)}{T(N)}$$\n$$S(N) = \\alpha + N(1 - \\alpha)$$\nThis expression, derived from first principles, relates the scaled speedup $S(N)$ to the serial fraction $\\alpha$ and the number of processors $N$.\n\nNow we must solve for $\\alpha$.\n$$S(N) = \\alpha + N - N\\alpha$$\n$$S(N) - N = \\alpha - N\\alpha$$\n$$S(N) - N = \\alpha(1 - N)$$\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{S(N) - N}{1 - N}$$\nTo avoid negative signs in the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $-1$:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{N - S(N)}{N - 1}$$\n\nThe problem provides the specific values $N = 128$ and a target speedup of $S(128) = 120$. We substitute these values into the derived equation for $\\alpha$.\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{128 - 120}{128 - 1}$$\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{8}{127}$$\n\nTo provide the final answer, we compute the numerical value and round to four significant figures.\n$$\\alpha \\approx 0.0629921259...$$\nThe first four significant figures are $6$, $2$, $9$, $9$. The fifth digit is $2$, which is less than $5$, so we do not round up the last significant figure.\n$$\\alpha \\approx 0.06299$$\nThis is the maximum allowable serial fraction that meets the specified design target.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.06299}$$", "id": "3139830"}, {"introduction": "The serial fraction $\\alpha$ is a critical property of an algorithm that directly dictates its potential for scaling on parallel hardware.

In weak scaling, the problem size grows proportionally with the number of processing elements, so that each processing element handles a fixed workload. Consider two computational kernels, each characterized by a measured single-processor fraction of time spent in inherently sequential work, denoted by $\\alpha$, at the baseline workload size. The two kernels have $\\alpha_{1} = 0.06$ and $\\alpha_{2} = 0.12$, respectively, with $\\alpha_{1} < \\alpha_{2}$. Assume that the parallelizable fraction behaves ideally under weak scaling: the parallel portion is perfectly distributed across $N$ processing elements, while the sequential portion remains serialized.\n\nStarting from the foundational definitions of parallel execution time decomposition and speedup, derive the weak-scaling speedup $S(N)$ as a function of $N$ and $\\alpha$, and use it to determine when the speedup achieves at least $95\\%$ of ideal linear scaling, meaning $S(N) \\geq 0.95\\,N$.

Define the sequential fraction as\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{T_{s}}{T_{s} + T_{p}}.\n$$\nUnder weak scaling to $N$ processing elements, the problem size is increased so that each processing element receives the same amount of parallel work as in the single-processor baseline. With ideal distribution, the time to complete the parallel portion on $N$ processing elements remains equal to the single-processor parallel time for the baseline workload on each processing element, while the sequential portion remains serialized and must still be executed by one processing element. Using normalized units where the baseline total time $T_{1}$ is set to $1$, we have $T_{s} = \\alpha$ and $T_{p} = 1 - \\alpha$.\n\nFor the scaled problem on $N$ processing elements, the total scaled single-processor time (if one processor were to execute the scaled problem) would be\n$$\nT_{1}^{\\text{scaled}} = T_{s} + N T_{p} = \\alpha + N(1 - \\alpha).\n$$\nThe actual parallel execution time on $N$ processing elements remains\n$$\nT_{N} = T_{s} + T_{p} = \\alpha + (1 - \\alpha) = 1,\n$$\nbecause the ideal parallelization under weak scaling keeps the time per processing element constant for the parallel portion, and the serialized portion is unchanged.\n\nBy the definition of speedup,\n$$\nS(N) = \\frac{T_{1}^{\\text{scaled}}}{T_{N}} = \\frac{\\alpha + N(1 - \\alpha)}{1} = \\alpha + N(1 - \\alpha).\n$$\nThis is equivalent to the commonly cited Gustafson’s law form $S(N) = N - \\alpha(N - 1)$, but here we have derived it directly from time decomposition under weak scaling.\n\nWe are asked to determine for each kernel when $S(N)$ achieves at least $95\\%$ of the ideal linear speedup $N$, meaning\n$$\nS(N) \\geq 0.95\\,N.\n$$\nSubstitute $S(N) = \\alpha + N(1 - \\alpha)$:\n$$\n\\alpha + N(1 - \\alpha) \\geq 0.95\\,N.\n$$\nRearrange to isolate $N$:\n$$\nN(1 - \\alpha) - 0.95\\,N \\geq -\\alpha \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad N(0.05 - \\alpha) \\geq -\\alpha.\n$$\nThis inequality can be analyzed casewise depending on the sign of $(0.05 - \\alpha)$.\n\nFor $\\alpha_{1} = 0.06$, we have $(0.05 - \\alpha_{1}) = -0.01 < 0$. Dividing the inequality by a negative number flips the inequality direction:\n$$\nN \\leq \\frac{-\\alpha_{1}}{0.05 - \\alpha_{1}} = \\frac{-0.06}{-0.01} = 6.\n$$\nTherefore, for kernel $1$, the condition $S(N) \\geq 0.95\\,N$ holds for all integers $N$ with $N \\leq 6$. The smallest integer $N \\geq 2$ satisfying the condition for kernel $1$ is $N = 2$.\n\nFor $\\alpha_{2} = 0.12$, we have $(0.05 - \\alpha_{2}) = -0.07 < 0$, yielding\n$$\nN \\leq \\frac{-\\alpha_{2}}{0.05 - \\alpha_{2}} = \\frac{-0.12}{-0.07} = \\frac{12}{7} \\approx 1.7142857\\ldots.\n$$\nThus, for kernel $2$, the condition $S(N) \\geq 0.95\\,N$ holds only for integer $N \\leq 1$.

Therefore, as $N$ grows beyond the trivial single-processor case, the earliest $N$ at which either kernel meets the threshold is $N = 2$, achieved by kernel $1$.\n\nThe requested final numeric answer is this minimal integer $N$ at which the threshold is first achieved by any of the two kernels:\n$$\nN = 2.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3139820"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate test of understanding a scientific model is to build and verify it from the ground up.

The definitions are clear, consistent, and sufficient for deriving a unique and meaningful solution.\n\nWe will now proceed with the derivation and subsequent numerical verification.\n\n### Derivation of Gustafson's Law from First Principles\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the weak-scaling speedup, $S(N)$, as a function of the number of workers, $N$, and the sequential fraction of the baseline program, $\\alpha$.\n\n**Step 1: Baseline Workload Analysis ($N=1$)**\n\nLet us consider the baseline workload executed on a single worker ($N=1$). The total execution time is given as $T_{\\text{base}}$, which we set to $1$ arbitrary time unit.\n$$\nT_1(\\text{text}) = T_{\\text{base}} = 1\n$$\nThis total time is composed of a sequential (non-parallelizable) part and a parallelizable part. According to the problem definition, $\\alpha$ is the fraction of time spent in the sequential part.\n-   Time for the sequential part: $T_{s,1} = \\alpha T_1(\\text{base}) = \\alpha \\cdot 1 = \\alpha$.\n-   Time for the parallelizable part: $T_{p,1} = (1-\\alpha) T_1(\\text{base}) = (1-\\alpha) \\cdot 1 = 1-\\alpha$.\n\nIt is useful to think in terms of the amount of computational work, which is proportional to execution time on a single worker. Assuming a single worker performs one unit of work per unit of time, the total work for the baseline case, $W_{\\text{base}}$, is:\n-   Sequential work: $W_s = T_{s,1} = \\alpha$.\n-   Parallelizable work: $W_p = T_{p,1} = 1-\\alpha$.\n\n**Step 2: Scaled Workload Analysis (for $N$ workers)**\n\nUnder weak scaling, the total problem size is increased to keep the execution time per worker constant. This is achieved by scaling the parallelizable portion of the work, while the sequential portion is assumed to remain fixed, as it often relates to overheads or problem setup/teardown that do not scale with data size.\n\n-   The sequential work for the scaled problem, $W_{s,N}$, remains constant: $W_{s,N} = W_s = \\alpha$.\n-   The parallelizable work, $W_{p,N}$, is scaled linearly with the number of workers: $W_{p,N} = N \\cdot W_p = N(1-\\alpha)$.\n\nThe total work for this new, scaled problem is the sum of its sequential and parallelizable components:\n$$\nW_{\\text{total}}(N) = W_{s,N} + W_{p,N} = \\alpha + N(1-\\alpha)\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Calculating Execution Times for the Scaled Workload**\n\nWe now calculate the execution time for this total work, $W_{\\text{total}}(N)$, on two different machine configurations: a single worker and $N$ workers.\n\n-   **Time on a single worker, $T_1(N)$**: A single worker must perform all the work, both sequential and parallelizable.\n    $$\n    T_1(N) = W_{\\text{total}}(N) = \\alpha + N(1-\\alpha)\n    $$\n-   **Time on $N$ workers, $T_N(N)$**: The $N$ workers execute the scaled workload in parallel.\n    -   The sequential work $W_{s,N}$ cannot be parallelized and must be executed by one worker, taking time $\\alpha$.\n    -   The parallelizable work $W_{p,N}$ is perfectly distributed among the $N$ workers. The time taken for this part is therefore $\\frac{W_{p,N}}{N} = \\frac{N(1-\\alpha)}{N} = 1-\\alpha$.\n    -   The total execution time on $N$ workers, $T_N(N)$, is the sum of the time for the sequential and parallel parts:\n        $$\n        T_N(N) = \\alpha + (1-\\alpha) = 1\n        $$\n    This result confirms the premise of weak scaling: the wall time for the scaled problem on $N$ workers is constant and equal to the baseline time, $T_{\\text{base}}=1$. For conciseness, we denote $T_N(N)$ as $T_N$.\n\n**Step 4: Deriving the Speedup Formula**\n\nThe problem defines the weak-scaling speedup, $S(N)$, as the ratio of the time a single worker would take to execute the scaled workload to the time $N$ workers actually take.\n$$\nS(N) = \\frac{T_1(N)}{T_N}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived in Step 3:\n$$\nS(N) = \\frac{\\alpha + N(1-\\alpha)}{1}\n$$\nThis gives the theoretical formula for Gustafson's Law:\n$$\nS_{\\text{theory}}(N) = \\alpha + N(1-\\alpha)\n$$\n\n### Numerical Verification Plan\n\nThe implementation will test the consistency of this derivation. For each test case $(N, \\alpha)$:\n1.  The parallel execution time for the scaled workload is $T_N = 1$.\n2.  The single-worker execution time for the scaled workload is $T_1(N) = \\alpha + N(1-\\alpha)$.\n3.  The \"measured\" speedup is calculated as $S_{\\text{meas}}(N) = T_1(N) / T_N$.\n4.  The \"theoretical\" speedup is calculated using the derived formula, $S_{\\text{theory}}(N) = \\alpha + N(1-\\alpha)$.\n5.  By construction, $S_{\\textmeas}(N) = S_{\\text{theory}}(N)$. The verification check, $|\\text{S}_{\\text{meas}}(N) - S_{\\text{theory}}(N)| \\le \\varepsilon$, will therefore confirm the self-consistency of the implementation of the derived model.
