A matrix $A$ is symmetric if $A = A^\\top$. Let's examine the given matrix $A(\\alpha)$:\n$$\nA(\\alpha)=\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1+\\alpha & 0 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n0 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nFor $A(\\alpha)$ to be symmetric, we need $A_{12} = A_{21}$, which implies $-1 + \\alpha = -1$. This condition is only satisfied when $\\alpha = 0$. For any nonzero $\\alpha$, the matrix $A(\\alpha)$ is non-symmetric. Therefore, the standard IC(0) factorization is not applicable.\n\n### Analysis of Incomplete LU (ILU(0))\n\nThe ILU(0) factorization without pivoting proceeds by applying Gaussian elimination while disallowing any fill-in. The factorization can break down if it encounters a zero pivot (a zero on the diagonal of the upper triangular factor $U$). Let's perform the factorization step-by-step. We seek a unit lower triangular matrix $L$ and an upper triangular matrix $U$ with the same sparsity pattern as $A(\\alpha)$, such that their product approximates $A(\\alpha)$.\n\nLet $L = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ l_{21} & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & l_{32} & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $U = \\begin{bmatrix} u_{11} & u_{12} & 0 \\\\ 0 & u_{22} & u_{23} \\\\ 0 & 0 & u_{33} \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nThe factorization proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Row 1:** The first row of $U$ is the same as the first row of $A(\\alpha)$.\n    $u_{11} = 2$\n    $u_{12} = -1 + \\alpha$\n    The first pivot, $u_{11} = 2$, is non-zero, so the factorization can start.\n\n2.  **Row 2:** We compute the entries for the second row.\n    $l_{21} = A_{21} / u_{11} = -1 / 2$.\n    $u_{22} = A_{22} - l_{21} u_{12} = 2 - (-\\frac{1}{2})(-1 + \\alpha) = 2 - \\frac{1 - \\alpha}{2} = \\frac{4 - (1 - \\alpha)}{2} = \\frac{3 + \\alpha}{2}$.\n    The second pivot is $u_{22}$. The factorization will break down if $u_{22} = 0$, which occurs when $3 + \\alpha = 0$, or $\\alpha = -3$.\n    $u_{23} = A_{23} - l_{21}u_{13} = -1 - (-\\frac{1}{2})(0) = -1$.\n\n3.  **Row 3:** We compute the entries for the third row.\n    $l_{32} = (A_{32} - l_{31}u_{12}) / u_{22}$. Since $A_{31}=0$, $l_{31}=0$.\n    $l_{32} = A_{32} / u_{22} = -1 / u_{22} = -1 / (\\frac{3+\\alpha}{2}) = -\\frac{2}{3+\\alpha}$. This step requires $u_{22} \\neq 0$, so $\\alpha \\neq -3$.\n    $u_{33} = A_{33} - (l_{31}u_{13} + l_{32}u_{23}) = 2 - (0 \\cdot 0 + (-\\frac{2}{3+\\alpha})(-1)) = 2 - \\frac{2}{3+\\alpha} = \\frac{2(3+\\alpha) - 2}{3+\\alpha} = \\frac{6+2\\alpha-2}{3+\\alpha} = \\frac{4+2\\alpha}{3+\\alpha}$.\n    The third pivot is $u_{33}$. The factorization will break down if $u_{33} = 0$, which occurs when $4 + 2\\alpha = 0$, or $\\alpha = -2$.\n\nIn summary, the ILU(0) factorization fails if a pivot becomes zero, which happens when $\\alpha = -3$ or $\\alpha = -2$. For all other values of $\\alpha$, the factorization completes successfully.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A. Because Cholesky requires exact symmetry, any nonzero asymmetry ($\\alpha \\neq 0$) makes Incomplete Cholesky (IC) inapplicable to $A(\\alpha)$; Incomplete Lower-Upper (LU) factorization (ILU) without pivoting succeeds for all $\\alpha$ with $3+\\alpha \\neq 0$ and $\\alpha \\neq -2$, so small asymmetry does not break ILU$(0)$.**\n    This statement is fully consistent with our analysis.

The claim about ILU is false; it only fails at specific values of $\\alpha$.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Both Incomplete Cholesky (IC) and Incomplete Lower-Upper (LU) factorization (ILU) succeed for any real $\\alpha$ because $A(\\alpha)$ is strictly diagonally dominant for all $\\alpha$.**\n    This is false. As shown, both methods can fail. Furthermore, the matrix is not strictly diagonally dominant for any $\\alpha$, because for the second row, $|A_{22}| = 2$ and the sum of off-diagonals is $|A_{21}| + |A_{23}| = |-1| + |-1| = 2$. Strict dominance requires $|A_{22}| > 2$.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D.

All terms like `tridiagonal matrix`, `skew-symmetric`, `symmetric positive definite`, `ILU(0)`, `IC(0)`, `preconditioning`, and `spectral clustering` are well-defined and standard. The construction of the matrices $T$, $E$, and $A$ is mathematically sound. The matrix $T$ is a classic example of an SPD matrix (a scaled discrete one-dimensional Laplacian). The foundational facts provided are correct statements about matrix factorizations. The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, providing sufficient information to derive a unique solution by analyzing the specified preconditioning methods. The setup is a canonical example used to illustrate the behavior of preconditioners on nearly symmetric systems.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the derivation and analysis.\n\n### Derivation\n\nThe matrix $T$ is given by:\n$$\nT = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 2 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe perturbation matrix $E$ is:\n$$\nE = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe matrix $A$ is $A = T + \\varepsilon E$:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1+\\varepsilon & 0 & 0 \\\\ -1-\\varepsilon & 2 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe symmetric part of $A$ is correctly identified as $S = T$, since $A^\\top = T^\\top + \\varepsilon E^\\top = T - \\varepsilon E$, and thus $S = \\frac{1}{2}(A+A^\\top) = \\frac{1}{2}((T+\\varepsilon E) + (T-\\varepsilon E)) = T$.\n\n**Analysis of the ILU(0) Preconditioner for $A$**\n\nThe ILU($0$) preconditioner, $M_{\\text{ILU}}$, is constructed by performing a LU factorization of $A$ and discarding any \"fill-in\"—that is, any new non-zero entries in the factors $L$ and $U$ at positions $(i,j)$ where $A_{ij}$ was zero.\n\nThe matrix $A$ is a tridiagonal matrix. As stated in foundational fact (ii), the exact LU factorization of a tridiagonal matrix does not produce any fill-in, provided the pivots (the diagonal elements of the upper triangular factor $U$) are non-zero. For this specific matrix $A$, which is a small perturbation of the SPD matrix $T$, the pivots will be positive and thus non-zero. For instance, the first pivot is $A_{11}=2$. After the first step of Gaussian elimination, the new $(2,2)$ entry is $A_{22} - \\frac{A_{21}A_{12}}{A_{11}} = 2 - \\frac{(-1-\\varepsilon)(-1+\\varepsilon)}{2} = 2 - \\frac{1-\\varepsilon^2}{2} = \\frac{3+\\varepsilon^2}{2} > 0$. This pattern continues, and all pivots remain positive.\n\nSince the exact LU factorization of $A$ generates no fill-in, the ILU($0$) algorithm, which is designed to discard fill-in, will produce the exact factors of $A$.\nTherefore, the ILU($0$) preconditioner is identical to the matrix $A$ itself:\n$$\nM_{\\text{ILU}} = LU = A\n$$\nThe preconditioned operator is then:\n$$\nM_{\\text{ILU}}^{-1} A = A^{-1} A = I\n$$\nwhere $I$ is the $4 \\times 4$ identity matrix. The spectrum of this preconditioned operator consists of a single eigenvalue, $1$, with multiplicity $4$. This represents perfect preconditioning, as an iterative solver like GMRES would converge in a single iteration (in exact arithmetic).\n\n**Analysis of the IC(0) Preconditioner for $A$**\n\nThe incomplete Cholesky factorization is defined for symmetric matrices. As specified, it must be applied to the symmetric part of $A$, which is $S=T$. The IC($0$) preconditioner, $M_{\\text{IC}}$, is constructed by performing a Cholesky factorization of $S$ and discarding any fill-in.\n\nThe matrix $S=T$ is a symmetric positive definite tridiagonal matrix. As stated in foundational fact (iii), the exact Cholesky factorization of such a matrix produces no fill-in. The Cholesky factor $L$ is a lower bidiagonal matrix.\nTherefore, the IC($0$) algorithm computes the exact Cholesky factorization of $S$.\nThis means the IC($0$) preconditioner is identical to the matrix $S$ itself:\n$$\nM_{\\text{IC}} = LL^\\top = S = T\n$$\nWhen this preconditioner is applied to the original non-symmetric matrix $A$, the preconditioned operator is:\n$$\nM_{\\text{IC}}^{-1} A = S^{-1} A = S^{-1}(S + \\varepsilon E) = I + \\varepsilon S^{-1} E\n$$\nThis preconditioned operator is not the identity matrix. It deviates from $I$ by the term $\\varepsilon S^{-1} E$, which is of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon)$. The eigenvalues of this operator are not all equal to $1$. The eigenvalues of $S^{-1}E$ are known to be purely imaginary. Thus, the eigenvalues of $M_{\\text{IC}}^{-1} A$ are of the form $1 + i\\beta_j$ for some real numbers $\\beta_j$ of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon)$. The spectrum is clustered around $1$, but spread along the vertical line $\\text{Re}(z)=1$ in the complex plane. This is a less favorable spectral distribution for iterative solvers compared to a single eigenvalue at $1$.\n\n**Comparison and Conclusion**\n\nThe ILU($0$) preconditioner results in the operator $M_{\\text{ILU}}^{-1} A = I$, which is ideal. The IC($0$) preconditioner results in the operator $M_{\\text{IC}}^{-1} A = I + \\varepsilon S^{-1} E \\neq I$. Consequently, an iterative method applied to the ILU($0$)-preconditioned system will converge much faster (ideally, in one step) than for the IC($0$)-preconditioned system. Thus, ILU($0$) yields strictly better preconditioning in this case. The mechanism is the fact that ILU($0$) exactly factorizes the tridiagonal matrix $A$, while IC($0$) exactly factorizes only its symmetric part $S$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Because $A$ is tridiagonal, ILU(0) with natural ordering reproduces the exact LU factors of $A$ without any fill, so $M_{\\text{ILU}}^{-1} A = I$; in contrast, IC(0) must be applied to the symmetric part $S$, giving $M_{\\text{IC}} = S$, so $M_{\\text{IC}}^{-1} A = S^{-1} A = I + \\varepsilon S^{-1} E \\neq I$, with a skew-symmetric $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon)$ deviation that degrades spectral clustering and convergence.**\n\nThis option correctly identifies the core mechanism. Its assertion that ILU($0$) reproduces the exact LU factors of the tridiagonal matrix $A$ is correct, leading to the conclusion that $M_{\\text{ILU}}^{-1} A = I$. Its assertion that IC($0$) must be applied to $S$ and that for the tridiagonal matrix $S=T$, this gives $M_{\\textIC}=S$ is also correct. The resulting preconditioned operator $M_{\\text{IC}}^{-1} A = I + \\varepsilon S^{-1} E \\neq I$ is also correctly derived. The final conclusion that this deviation degrades spectral clustering and convergence compared to the perfect clustering of ILU($0$) is sound. The description of the deviation term $\\varepsilon S^{-1} E$ as \"skew-symmetric\" is technically inaccurate, as $S^{-1}$ and $E$ do not commute in general. However, this minor point does not invalidate the overwhelmingly correct description of the primary mechanism at play. Among the given choices, this option provides the most accurate and complete explanation.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. IC(0) always reproduces the exact factorization for any tridiagonal matrix (symmetric or not), so $M_{\\textIC}^{-1} A = I$, and ILU(0) offers no advantage here.**\n\nThis statement is false. The Cholesky factorization, and thus IC($0$), is only defined for symmetric matrices. It cannot be applied to the non-symmetric matrix $A$. The problem statement correctly directs its application to the symmetric part $S$. The premise of the option is fundamentally incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. IC(0) is guaranteed to be superior to ILU(0) whenever the matrix is diagonally dominant, so in this case IC(0) strictly outperforms ILU(0).**\n\nThis option makes a false general claim. There is no theorem guaranteeing IC($0$) is always superior for diagonally dominant matrices, particularly when the matrix is non-symmetric. Furthermore, the matrix $A$ is not strictly diagonally dominant, as for row $2$, the diagonal entry is $|A_{22}|=2$ and the sum of the absolute values of off-diagonal entries is $|A_{21}|+|A_{23}| = |-1-\\varepsilon| + |-1| = 1+\\varepsilon+1 = 2+\\varepsilon$, and $2 \\not> 2+\\varepsilon$. Most importantly, our direct analysis has already proven that ILU($0$) is perfect in this case, while IC($0$) is not. Therefore, ILU($0$) outperforms IC($0$).\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. ILU(0) introduces additional fill beyond the original sparsity, making its approximation more accurate than IC(0); this extra fill is the reason ILU(0) preconditions better in this case.**\n\nThis statement directly contradicts the definition of ILU($0$). The \"($0$)\" denotes zero-level fill, meaning no new non-zero entries are allowed in the factors. The very premise of the option is false. The reason for the superior performance of ILU($0$) in this specific case is that the exact factorization of the tridiagonal matrix $A$ requires no fill-in, not because ILU($0$) introduces it.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3143610"}, {"introduction": "This final practice bridges the gap between theory and real-world application by tasking you with a coding implementation.

The final answers must be raw floating-point numbers without units.", "solution": "The problem asks for an empirical determination of the smallest diagonal perturbation, $\\epsilon$, from a given set $S$ that stabilizes the incomplete LU factorization of order zero, ILU(0), for a given matrix $A$ and breakdown tolerance $\\tau$.\n\nAn LU factorization of a square matrix $A$ decomposes it into a product of a unit lower-triangular matrix $L$ and an upper-triangular matrix $U$, such that $A = LU$. The incomplete LU factorization, ILU($p$), is an approximation to this decomposition where a certain amount of \"fill-in\" (creation of nonzeros in $L$ and $U$ at positions that are zero in $A$) is allowed, controlled by the level $p$. The specific variant in this problem is ILU(0), where no fill-in is permitted. The sparsity patterns of $L$ and $U$ must be subsets of the sparsity pattern of $A$. That is, if an entry $(i,j)$ is zero in the original matrix $A$, it must remain zero in $L$ (if $i>j$) or $U$ (if $i \\le j$).\n\nThe standard algorithm for LU factorization can fail (break down) if it encounters a zero or very small pivot element on the diagonal of $U$. This is because the algorithm requires division by these pivots. The ILU(0) algorithm is similarly susceptible to breakdown. A common technique to prevent this is to add a small positive value to the diagonal entries of $A$. This is known as diagonal perturbation or diagonal shifting. We form the matrix $A_{\\epsilon} = A + \\epsilon I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix and $\\epsilon$ is a small nonnegative scalar. This directly increases the magnitude of the diagonal entries, which in turn tends to increase the magnitude of the pivots $U_{ii}$, thus stabilizing the factorization. The task is to find the minimum $\\epsilon$ from a candidate set $S$ that is sufficient to prevent the absolute value of any pivot from falling below a given tolerance $\\tau$.\n\nThe procedure to solve this problem involves implementing the specified ILU(0) algorithm and then, for each test case, iterating through the candidate perturbations $\\epsilon \\in S$ in ascending order. The first $\\epsilon$ for which the ILU(0) of $A_\\epsilon$ completes without breakdown is the desired result.\n\nThe ILU(0) algorithm is implemented as follows, following the problem statement's constraints. Let $P$ be the set of indices $(i,j)$ corresponding to structural nonzeros in $A$, with all diagonal positions $(i,i)$ included.\nThe matrices $L$ and $U$ are constructed row by row, for $i = 1, \\dots, n$.\n\nFor each row $i$:\n1.  Compute the relevant entries of the $i$-th row of $L$. For each $j$ from $1$ to $i-1$, if $(i,j) \\in P$:\n    Before computing $L_{ij}$, a breakdown check is performed on the pivot $U_{jj}$: if $|U_{jj}| < \\tau$, the factorization fails. Otherwise, we compute:\n    $$\n    L_{ij} = \\frac{A_{\\epsilon,ij} - \\sum_{k=1}^{j-1} L_{ik} U_{kj}}{U_{jj}}\n    $$\n    The sum is restricted to include only terms where $(i,k) \\in P$ and $(k,j) \\in P$. This enforces the zero fill-in constraint. In practice, since $L$ and $U$ are built to respect the pattern $P$, any term where the indices are not in $P$ would be zero anyway.\n\n2.  Set the diagonal of $L$: $L_{ii} = 1$.\n\n3.  Compute the relevant entries of the $i$-th row of $U$. For each $j$ from $i$ to $n$, if $(i,j) \\in P$:\n    $$\n    U_{ij} = A_{\\epsilon,ij} - \\sum_{k=1}^{i-1} L_{ik} U_{kj}\n    $$\n    Again, the sum is restricted by the sparsity pattern $P$.\n\n4.  After computing all entries for row $i$, a final breakdown check is performed on the newly computed pivot $U_{ii}$: if $|U_{ii}| < \\tau$, the factorization fails.\n\nIf this process completes for all rows $i=1, \\dots, n$ without any breakdown check failing, the factorization is deemed successful for the chosen $\\epsilon$.\n\nFor each test case provided:\n- The set of candidate perturbations $S$ is already sorted.\n- We iterate through $\\epsilon \\in S$.\n- For a given $\\epsilon$, we run the ILU(0) algorithm on $A_{\\epsilon} = A + \\epsilon I$ with tolerance $\\tau$.\n- If the algorithm succeeds, we record this $\\epsilon$ as the minimal stabilizing perturbation for that test case and proceed to the next test case.\n- If we exhaust all $\\epsilon \\in S$ and all of them lead to breakdown, we record a not-a-number value (`NaN`) for that test case.\n\nThe final output is a list of these minimal $\\epsilon$ values for each test case in the specified order.\n\n```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef perform_ilu0(A, epsilon, tau):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs ILU(0) factorization on a given matrix A with diagonal perturbation.\n\n    Args:\n        A (np.ndarray): The input square matrix.\n        epsilon (float): The non-negative scalar for diagonal perturbation.\n        tau (float): The positive tolerance for pivot breakdown.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the factorization is successful, False if breakdown occurs.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = A.shape[0]\n    \n    # Create the perturbed matrix A_epsilon = A + epsilon * I\n    A_eps = A.copy()\n    if epsilon > 0.0:\n        # Add epsilon to diagonal elements.
