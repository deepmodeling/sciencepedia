{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Sequential data assimilation techniques, such as the Kalman filter, update the state estimate by incorporating observations one at a time. For linear systems with uncorrelated observation errors, the final result is famously independent of the order in which observations are processed. This practice [@problem_id:3116062] invites you to verify this principle and, more importantly, to discover what happens when we move to nonlinear systems using the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). By implementing and comparing different assimilation sequences, you will gain hands-on insight into the crucial role that linearization plays and why the order of operations becomes a critical consideration in many real-world applications.", "problem": "You are given a finite-dimensional state vector $\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ with a Gaussian prior distribution characterized by mean $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_0$ and covariance $\\mathbf{P}_0$. A set of observational data consists of scalar observations $y_i$ of the form $y_i = h_i(\\mathbf{x}) + \\varepsilon_i$, where $h_i$ is an observation operator and $\\varepsilon_i$ is observation noise. Assume $\\varepsilon_i$ are mutually independent, each distributed as a Gaussian with zero mean and variance $r_i$, so the observation error covariance matrix $\\mathbf{R}$ is diagonal in the multi-observation sense. In serial data assimilation, observations are incorporated one at a time to update the state. This problem asks you to implement serial assimilation in two scenarios: with linear observation operators and with nonlinear observation operators. You must compare two different serial orders of assimilation and test whether the final posterior (mean and covariance) is invariant to the order of assimilation.\n\nStart from the fundamental base of Bayes’ rule, namely $p(\\mathbf{x}\\mid \\mathbf{y}) \\propto p(\\mathbf{y}\\mid \\mathbf{x}) p(\\mathbf{x})$, together with the assumptions of Gaussian prior and Gaussian observation errors. For linear observation operators, use the foundational facts that the product of independent Gaussian likelihoods commutes and that the posterior under linear-Gaussian assumptions is Gaussian. For nonlinear observation operators, use a first-order Taylor approximation of $h(\\mathbf{x})$ about the current mean to obtain a locally linear update (the Extended Kalman Filter on first appearance shall be spelled out as Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)). Your program must implement serial assimilation updates derived from these principles without assuming or using any shortcut formula provided explicitly in the problem statement.\n\nYour program must:\n- Represent the state and covariance as $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ and $\\mathbf{P}$.\n- For each observation $y$ with operator $h(\\cdot)$ and noise variance $r$, perform a single-assimilation update step.\n- For linear operators $h(\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{x}$, treat $\\mathbf{H}$ as a row vector and update $(\\boldsymbol{\\mu},\\mathbf{P})$ accordingly.\n- For nonlinear operators, use EKF-style local linearization: $h(\\mathbf{x}) \\approx h(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}) + \\mathbf{H}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}) (\\mathbf{x}-\\boldsymbol{\\mu})$, where $\\mathbf{H}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu})$ is the Jacobian evaluated at the current mean, and then perform a linear-Gaussian update.\n- Execute two serial orders for each test case, compute the final posterior mean and covariance from each order, and determine whether the results are invariant to order within a strict numerical tolerance $\\epsilon$.\n\nUse the following test suite and parameters. In all cases, the measurement errors are independent, so the observation error covariance $\\mathbf{R}$ is diagonal, with individual variances $r_i$ specified below. For each test, compare the two serial orders $(\\text{order } A)$ and $(\\text{order } B)$. Report order invariance as a boolean that is `True` if both the maximum absolute difference in the posterior means and the Frobenius norm difference in the posterior covariances between the two orders are less than or equal to $\\epsilon$, and `False` otherwise. Use numerical tolerance $\\epsilon = 10^{-10}$.\n\nTest case $1$ (linear, happy path):\n- State dimension $n = 2$.\n- Prior $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_0 = [1.0,-2.0]$, $\\mathbf{P}_0 = \\begin{bmatrix} 2.0 & 0.5 \\\\ 0.5 & 1.0 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n- Observation $1$: $y_1 = 0.9$, $h_1(\\mathbf{x}) = [1,0]\\mathbf{x}$, $r_1 = 0.4$.\n- Observation $2$: $y_2 = -1.8$, $h_2(\\mathbf{x}) = [2,-1]\\mathbf{x}$, $r_2 = 0.3$.\n- Orders: $(\\text{order } A) = (1,2)$, $(\\text{order } B) = (2,1)$.\nExpected behavior: for linear $\\mathbf{H}$ and diagonal $\\mathbf{R}$, order invariance should hold.\n\nTest case $2$ (linear, boundary condition with one weak observation):\n- State dimension $n = 1$.\n- Prior $\\mu_0 = 0.0$, $P_0 = 1.0$.\n- Observation $1$: $y_1 = 1.0$, $h_1(x) = x$, $r_1 = 0.5$.\n- Observation $2$: $y_2 = -2.0$, $h_2(x) = x$, $r_2 = 1000.0$.\n- Orders: $(\\text{order } A) = (1,2)$, $(\\text{order } B) = (2,1)$.\nExpected behavior: with a very noisy second observation and diagonal $\\mathbf{R}$, order invariance should hold.\n\nTest case $3$ (nonlinear, mild nonlinearity):\n- State dimension $n = 1$.\n- Prior $\\mu_0 = 0.5$, $P_0 = 0.5$.\n- Observation $1$: $y_1 = 0.0$, $h_1(x) = \\sin(x)$, $r_1 = 0.05$.\n- Observation $2$: $y_2 = 1.0$, $h_2(x) = x^2$, $r_2 = 0.05$.\n- Orders: $(\\text{order } A) = (1,2)$, $(\\text{order } B) = (2,1)$.\nExpected behavior: with EKF-style linearization at the current mean, order invariance generally breaks because the linearization points differ.\n\nTest case $4$ (nonlinear, stronger nonlinearity):\n- State dimension $n = 1$.\n- Prior $\\mu_0 = -1.2$, $P_0 = 0.2$.\n- Observation $1$: $y_1 = 1.0$, $h_1(x) = \\exp(x)$, $r_1 = 0.1$.\n- Observation $2$: $y_2 = -0.5$, $h_2(x) = \\tanh(x)$, $r_2 = 0.1$.\n- Orders: $(\\text{order } A) = (1,2)$, $(\\text{order } B) = (2,1)$.\nExpected behavior: with EKF-style linearization, order invariance breaks due to different linearization points and pronounced nonlinearity.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. For the four test cases in the order listed above, output `[result_1,result_2,result_3,result_4]`, where each `result_i` is a boolean `True` or `False` computed by comparing the two orders as specified, using tolerance $\\epsilon = 10^{-10}$.", "solution": "We begin from Bayes’ rule, $p(\\mathbf{x}\\mid \\mathbf{y}) \\propto p(\\mathbf{y}\\mid \\mathbf{x}) p(\\mathbf{x})$, and the assumptions that the prior is Gaussian, $\\mathbf{x}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_0,\\mathbf{P}_0)$, and each scalar observation has independent Gaussian noise, $y_i = h_i(\\mathbf{x}) + \\varepsilon_i$ with $\\varepsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,r_i)$. For serial assimilation, we incorporate one observation at a time, updating the mean and covariance after each observation.\n\nUnder linear observation operators, $h(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{x}$ with $\\mathbf{H}$ a row vector and $y$ scalar, the likelihood is $p(y\\mid \\mathbf{x}) \\propto \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{1}{2r}(y-\\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{x})^2\\right)$. The posterior after one observation remains Gaussian. The Kalman-style update emerges from completing the square in the exponent of the product $p(y\\mid \\mathbf{x}) p(\\mathbf{x})$. In particular, the posterior mean $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}^+$ and covariance $\\mathbf{P}^+$ are obtained by combining $\\mathbf{P}^{-1}$ and $\\mathbf{H}^T r^{-1} \\mathbf{H}$ in the precision domain and the linear term $\\mathbf{H}^T r^{-1} y$ in the information vector. Equivalently, the familiar Kalman gain expression may be derived:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K} = \\mathbf{P}\\mathbf{H}^T\\left(\\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{P}\\mathbf{H}^T + r\\right)^{-1},\n$$\nand the updates are\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\mu}^+ = \\boldsymbol{\\mu} + \\mathbf{K}\\left(y - \\mathbf{H}\\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\right),\\quad\n\\mathbf{P}^+ = \\left(\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{H}\\right)\\mathbf{P}\\left(\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{H}\\right)^T + \\mathbf{K} r \\mathbf{K}^T,\n$$\nwhere the latter is the Joseph form that preserves symmetry and positive semidefiniteness numerically.\n\nFor multiple independent observations $\\{y_i\\}$ with linear operators $\\{\\mathbf{H}_i\\}$ and variances $\\{r_i\\}$, the joint likelihood factors as a product $\\prod_i p(y_i\\mid \\mathbf{x})$. Because multiplication is commutative, $\\prod_i p(y_i\\mid \\mathbf{x})$ is invariant to observation ordering. In the Gaussian-linear case, serial assimilation replicates the batch result found by multiplying all likelihoods at once, so the final posterior $(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}^+,\\mathbf{P}^+)$ does not depend on the order. Therefore, with diagonal $\\mathbf{R}$ and linear $\\mathbf{H}$, order invariance holds.\n\nFor nonlinear observation operators, $h(\\mathbf{x})$, we adopt the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) approach: at the current mean $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$, approximate $h(\\mathbf{x})$ by its first-order Taylor expansion,\n$$\nh(\\mathbf{x}) \\approx h(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}) + \\mathbf{H}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}) (\\mathbf{x}-\\boldsymbol{\\mu}),\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{H}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu})$ is the Jacobian of $h$ evaluated at $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$. Using this local linearization in place of $h$, we perform a linear-Gaussian update with effective observation model $y \\approx h(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}) + \\mathbf{H}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu})(\\mathbf{x}-\\boldsymbol{\\mu})$. The EKF update formulas mirror the linear case but with $\\mathbf{H}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu})$ and $h(\\boldsymbol{\\mu})$ replacing $\\mathbf{H}$ and $\\mathbf{H}\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$, respectively.\n\nCritically, serial EKF assimilation linearizes $h$ at the current posterior mean before each update. If observations are assimilated in different orders, the sequence of posterior means changes, and thus the linearization points $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ change. Because $\\mathbf{H}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu})$ and $h(\\boldsymbol{\\mu})$ depend on $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ in nonlinear ways, the cumulative effect of two serial updates generally depends on the order. Hence order invariance is not guaranteed and often fails.\n\nAlgorithmic design:\n- Represent the state mean $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ and covariance $\\mathbf{P}$.\n- For a linear observation with row vector $\\mathbf{H}$, scalar $y$, variance $r$:\n  - Compute $\\mathbf{K} = \\mathbf{P}\\mathbf{H}^T(\\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{P}\\mathbf{H}^T + r)^{-1}$.\n  - Update $\\boldsymbol{\\mu} \\leftarrow \\boldsymbol{\\mu} + \\mathbf{K}(y - \\mathbf{H}\\boldsymbol{\\mu})$.\n  - Update $\\mathbf{P} \\leftarrow (\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{H})\\mathbf{P}(\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{H})^T + \\mathbf{K} r \\mathbf{K}^T$.\n- For a nonlinear observation with $h$ and Jacobian $\\mathbf{H}(\\cdot)$:\n  - Evaluate $h(\\boldsymbol{\\mu})$ and $\\mathbf{H}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu})$.\n  - Apply the same linear update using $h(\\boldsymbol{\\mu})$ in the innovation and $\\mathbf{H}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu})$ as the linear operator.\n\nFor each test case, run the two serial orders and compute:\n- The maximum absolute difference in final means: $\\Delta_\\mu = \\max_j |\\mu_j^{(A)} - \\mu_j^{(B)}|$.\n- The Frobenius norm difference in final covariances: $\\Delta_P = \\lVert \\mathbf{P}^{(A)} - \\mathbf{P}^{(B)} \\rVert_F$.\nDeclare order invariance `True` if $\\Delta_\\mu \\le \\epsilon$ and $\\Delta_P \\le \\epsilon$, else `False`, using $\\epsilon = 10^{-10}$.\n\nInterpretation for the provided tests:\n- Test $1$ and Test $2$ use linear $\\mathbf{H}$ and diagonal $\\mathbf{R}$, so the final posteriors from orders $A$ and $B$ must match within numerical tolerance, yielding `True`.\n- Test $3$ and Test $4$ use nonlinear $h$ with EKF-style linearization; assimilating $y_1$ then $y_2$ produces different intermediate means than assimilating $y_2$ then $y_1$, thus different linearization points and generally different final posteriors, yielding `False`.\n\nThe program implements these updates and prints a single line `[result_1,result_2,result_3,result_4]`, where each `result_i` is the boolean outcome for the corresponding test case.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef kalman_update_linear(mean, cov, H, y, r):\n    \"\"\"\n    Perform a single linear-Gaussian update with scalar observation.\n    mean: (n,) state mean\n    cov: (n,n) state covariance\n    H: (n,) observation row vector\n    y: scalar observation\n    r: scalar observation variance\n    Returns updated (mean, cov)\n    \"\"\"\n    H = H.reshape(-1)  # ensure 1D\n    n = mean.shape[0]\n    S = float(H @ cov @ H.T + r)  # innovation variance (scalar)\n    K = (cov @ H.T) / S           # gain shape (n,)\n    innovation = y -

We seek an increment $\\delta x$ such that the next estimate $x_{k+1} = x_k + \\delta x$ moves closer to the minimum of $J(x)$.\n\nThe linearization of $h(x)$ around $x_k$ is:\n$$\nh(x_{k+1}) = h(x_k + \\delta x) \\approx h(x_k) + H_k \\delta x\n$$\nwhere $H_k$ is the derivative (Jacobian) of $h(x)$ with respect to $x$, evaluated at $x_k$. For the given observation operator $h(x) = x^2$, the derivative is $h'(x) = 2x$. Therefore, the Jacobian at $x_k$ is:\n$$\nH_k = 2x_k\n$$\nSubstituting the linearized observation operator into the cost function $J(x)$, we obtain a quadratic approximation of the cost function with respect to the increment $\\delta x$, denoted as $J_k(\\delta x)$:\n$$\nJ_k(\\delta x) = (x_k + \\delta x - x_b)^2 B^{-1} + \\left(y - (h(x_k) + H_k \\delta x)\\right)^2 R^{-1}\n$$\nThis can be rewritten to emphasize the terms involving $\\delta x$:\n$$\nJ_k(\\delta x) = ((x_k - x_b) + \\delta x)^2 B^{-1} + ((y - h(x_k)) - H_k \\delta x)^2 R^{-1}\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Minimization and Derivation of the Increment**\n\nTo find the increment $\\delta x$ that minimizes this quadratic function $J_k(\\delta x)$, we compute its derivative with respect to $\\delta x$ and set it to zero.\n$$\n\\frac{dJ_k}{d(\\delta x)} = \\frac{d}{d(\\delta x)} \\left[ ((x_k - x_b) + \\delta x)^2 B^{-1} + ((y - h(x_k)) - H_k \\delta x)^2 R^{-1} \\right] = 0\n$$\nApplying the chain rule, we obtain:\n$$\n2((x_k - x_b) + \\delta x) \\cdot B^{-1} + 2((y - h(x_k)) - H_k \\delta x) \\cdot (-H_k) \\cdot R^{-1} = 0\n$$\nDividing by $2$ and expanding the terms:\n$$\nB^{-1}(x_k - x_b) + B^{-1}\\delta x - R^{-1}H_k(y - h(x_k)) + R^{-1}H_k^2 \\delta x = 0\n$$\nNow, we group the terms containing $\\delta x$ on one side of the equation and the remaining terms on the other:\n$$\n(B^{-1} + R^{-1}H_k^2) \\delta x = R^{-1}H_k(y - h(x_k)) - B^{-1}(x_k - x_b)\n$$\nTo solve for $\\delta x$, we can multiply the entire equation by $BR$ to clear the denominators, which is permissible since $B  0$ and $R  0$:\n$$\n(BR)(B^{-1} + R^{-1}H_k^2) \\delta x = (BR)(R^{-1}H_k(y - h(x_k)) - B^{-1}(x_k - x_b))\n$$\n$$\n(R + B H_k^2) \\delta x = B H_k(y - h(x_k)) - R(x_k - x_b)\n$$\nFinally, isolating the increment $\\delta x$ yields the update formula:\n$$\n\\delta x = \\frac{B H_k(y - h(x_k)) - R(x_k - x_b)}{R + B H_k^2}\n$$\n\n**Step 3: The Iterative Algorithm**\n\nThe complete Gauss-Newton iteration algorithm is as follows:\n1.  **Initialization**: Start with an initial guess $x_0$ at iteration $k=0$.\n2.  **Iteration**: For $k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, N_{\\max}-1$:\n    a.

Calculation of the steady-state RMSE.\n5.  Optimization of the assimilation frequency.\n\n### 1. System Discretization\nThe continuous-time dynamics of the state vector $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ are given by the stochastic differential equation:\n$$\n\\dot{x}(t) = A x(t) + L w(t)\n$$\nwhere $A = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ -\\omega^2  -\\gamma \\end{bmatrix}$, $L = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$, and $w(t)$ is a scalar white noise process with spectral density $q_c$, meaning $\\mathbb{E}[w(t) w(s)] = q_c \\delta(t-s)$.\n\nThe solution to this linear SDE over a time interval $\\Delta t$ from $t_k$ to $t_{k+1}$ is:\n$$\nx(t_{k+1}) = e^{A \\Delta t} x(t_k) + \\int_{t_k}^{t_{k+1}} e^{A(t_{k+1}-\\tau)} L w(\\tau) d\\tau\n$$\nThis gives rise to the discrete-time model $x_{k+1} = F x_k + \\eta_k$, where $x_k \\equiv x(t_k)$. The state transition matrix $F \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2 \\times 2}$ is the matrix exponential of the dynamics matrix $A$ over the time step $\\Delta t$:\n$$\nF = e^{A \\Delta t}\n$$\nThe process noise term $\\eta_k$ is a zero-mean Gaussian random variable with covariance matrix $Q \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2 \\times 2}$ given by the integral of the propagated noise:\n$$\nQ = \\mathbb{E}[\\eta_k \\eta_k^\\top] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\left(\\int_{0}^{\\Delta t} e^{A\\sigma} L w(t_{k+1}-\\sigma) d\\sigma\\right) \\left(\\int_{0}^{\\Delta t} e^{A\\tau} L w(t_{k+1}-\\tau) d\\tau\\right)^\\top \\right]\n$$\nUsing the property of white noise, this simplifies to:\n$$\nQ = \\int_{0}^{\\Delta t} e^{A\\sigma} L q_c L^\\top (e^{A\\sigma})^\\top d\\sigma\n$$\nComputationally, $F$ and $Q$ can be found efficiently using the Van Loan method, which involves computing the exponential of a larger block matrix:\n$$\n\\exp\\left( \\begin{bmatrix} -A  Lq_c L^\\top \\\\ 0  A^\\top \\end{bmatrix} \\Delta t \\right) = \\begin{bmatrix} M_{11}  M_{12} \\\\ 0  M_{22} \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nFrom this, we obtain $F = M_{22}^\\top$ and $Q = F M_{12}$.\n\n### 2. Kalman Filter Covariance Propagation\nThe Kalman Filter estimates the state $x_k$ using observations $z_k = H x_k + v_k$, where $H = \\begin{bmatrix} 1  0 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $v_k \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,R)$. The filter operates in a two-step cycle: forecast and analysis. We are interested in the evolution of the error covariance matrix $P = \\mathbb{E}[(x-\\hat{x})(x-\\hat{x})^\\top]$.\n\n**Forecast Step**: Given the analysis error covariance $P_{k-1}^a$ at time $t_{k-1}$, the forecast error covariance $P_k^f$ at time $t_k$ is:\n$$\nP_k^f = F P_{k-1}^a F^\\top + Q\n$$\n**Analysis Step**: At time $t_k$, an observation $z_k$ is assimilated. The forecast covariance $P_k^f$ is updated to the analysis covariance $P_k^a$ using the observation:\n$$\nP_k^a = (I - K_k H) P_k^f\n$$\nwhere $I$ is the identity matrix and $K_k$ is the Kalman gain:\n$$\nK_k = P_k^f H^\\top (H P_k^f H^\\top + R)^{-1}\n$$\n\n### 3. Steady Periodic Covariance Cycle\nObservations are available every $m$ model steps, so the assimilation period is $T_a = m \\Delta t$. A full assimilation cycle consists of one analysis update followed by $m$ forecast steps. In a steady periodic regime, the error covariance matrix is periodic with period $m$. Let $P^a$ be the analysis covariance at the beginning of a cycle (i.e., just after an observation is assimilated).\n\nTo find the steady-state covariance, we can define an effective $m$-step model. The state transition over one full cycle of $m$ steps is given by $F_m = F^m$. The accumulated process noise covariance over $m$ steps, $Q_m$, is $Q_m = \\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} F^j Q (F^j)^\\top$. More directly, $(F_m, Q_m)$ are the discretized system matrices corresponding to the time interval $T_a = m \\Delta t$, so they can be computed using the same Van Loan method as $(F, Q)$.\n$$\nF_m = e^{A T_a} \\quad , \\quad Q_m = \\int_{0}^{T_a} e^{A\\sigma} L q_c L^\\top (e^{A\\sigma})^\\top d\\sigma\n$$\nLet $P_m^f$ be the forecast error covariance at the end of the $m$-step cycle, just before an observation is assimilated. In the steady state, $P_m^f$ must be a fixed point of the $m$-step covariance propagation map. This leads to the Discrete Algebraic Riccati Equation (DARE) for the forecast covariance:\n$$\nP_m^f = F_m \\left( P_m^f - P_m^f H^\\top (H P_m^f H^\\top + R)^{-1} H P_m^f \\right) F_m^\\top + Q_m\n$$\nThis DARE can be solved numerically for the unique positive semi-definite solution $P_m^f$. Given this steady-state forecast covariance, the corresponding steady-state analysis covariance $P^a$ is found by one analysis update:\n$$\nP^a = (I - K_m H) P_m^f, \\quad \\text{with} \\quad K_m = P_m^f H^\\top (H P_m^f H^\\top + R)^{-1}\n$$\n\n### 4. Steady-State RMSE Calculation\nThe problem defines the RMSE as an average of the forecast error covariance trace over one assimilation cycle:\n$$\n\\mathrm{RMSE}(m) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{n} \\operatorname{trace}\\!\\left(P_j\\right)}\n$$\nHere, $n=2$ is the state dimension, and $P_j$ is the forecast error covariance at the $j$-th step after an analysis. The sequence of forecast covariances $P_1, P_2, \\dots, P_m$ is generated by starting with the steady-state analysis covariance $P^a$ and applying the one-step forecast recursion:\n-   $P_1 = F P^a F^\\top + Q$\n-   $P_2 = F P_1 F^\\top + Q$\n-   ...\n-   $P_j = F P_{j-1} F^\\top + Q$\n\nFor each candidate value of $m$, we compute $P^a$ and then generate the sequence $P_1, \\dots, P_m$ to evaluate $\\mathrm{RMSE}(m)$.\n\n### 5. Optimization\nThe final task is to find the assimilation interval $m$ from the provided set of candidates that minimizes $\\mathrm{RMSE}(m)$. The tie-breaking rule specifies that if multiple values of $m$ yield an RMSE within a tolerance $\\varepsilon = 10^{-10}$ of the minimum, the one corresponding to the largest assimilation frequency $f_a = 1/T_a = 1/(m \\Delta t)$ should be chosen. This is equivalent to selecting the smallest value of $m$ among the optimal candidates. The selected frequency $f_a$ must be reported in Hertz (s$^{-1}$).", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.linalg import expm, solve_discrete_are\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the problem for all test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    test_cases = [\n        # Test case 1\n        {\n            \"omega\": 2 * np.pi * 1.0,\n            \"gamma\": 0.2,\n            \"dt\": 0.01,\n            \"qc\": 0.5,\n            \"R\": 0.5,\n            \"m_candidates\": [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32],\n        },\n        # Test case 2\n        {\n            \"omega\": 2 * np.pi * 0.5,\n            \"gamma\": 0.05,\n            \"dt\": 0.02,\n            \"qc\": 2.0,\n            \"R\": 2.0,\n            \"m_candidates\": [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 24, 48],\n        },\n        # Test case 3\n        {\n            \"omega\": 2 * np.pi * 2.0,\n            \"gamma\": 1.0,\n            \"dt\": 0.005,\n            \"qc\": 0.1,\n            \"R\": 0.1,\n            \"m_candidates\": [1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80],\n        },\n        # Test case 4\n        {\n            \"omega\": 2 * np.pi * 1.5,\n            \"gamma\": 0.0,\n            \"dt\": 0.01,\n            \"qc\": 1.0,\n            \"R\": 0.3,\n            \"m_candidates\": [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64],\n        },\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        optimal_fa = find_optimal_fa(case)\n        results.append(f\"{optimal_fa:.6f}\")\n\n    print(f\"[{','.join(results)}]\")\n\ndef find_optimal_fa(params):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the optimal assimilation frequency for a single parameter set.\n    \"\"\"\n    omega = params[\"omega\"]\n    gamma = params[\"gamma\"]\n    dt = params[\"dt\"]\n    qc = params[\"qc\"]\n    R = params[\"R\"]\n    m_candidates = params[\"m_candidates\"]\n    \n    n_dim = 2\n    A = np.array([[0.0, 1.0], [-omega**2, -gamma]])\n    L = np.array([[0.0], [1.0]])\n    H = np.array([[1.0, 0.0]])\n    \n    def get_discrete_system(time_step):\n        # Van Loan method to compute F and Q\n        block_matrix = np.zeros((2 * n_dim, 2 * n_dim))\n        block_matrix[:n_dim, :n_dim] = -A\n        block_matrix[:n_dim, n_dim:] = L @ L.T * qc\n        block_matrix[n_dim:, n_dim:] = A.T\n        \n        exp_M = expm(block_matrix * time_step)\n        \n        F_d = exp_M[n_dim:, n_dim:].T\n        Q_d = F_d @ exp_M[:n_dim, n_dim:]\n        return F_d, Q_d\n\n    F, Q = get_discrete_system(dt)\n\n    rmse_results = []\n    for m in m_candidates:\n        Ta = m * dt\n        Fm, Qm = get_discrete_system(Ta)\n        \n        # To solve the filter DARE using a control DARE solver, we use duality.\n        # Filter DARE for (F, H, Q, R) is equivalent to control DARE for (F.T, H.T, Q, R).\n        # solve_discrete_are solves X = a.T*X*a - (a.T*X*b)*(r+b.T*X*b)^-1*(b.T*X*a) + q\n        # Our filter DARE is P_f = F_m * P_a * F_m.T + Q_m\n        # where P_a = (I-KH)P_f.
