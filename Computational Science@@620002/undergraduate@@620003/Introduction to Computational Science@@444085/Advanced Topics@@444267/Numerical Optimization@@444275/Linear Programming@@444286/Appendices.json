Since both components are non-negative ($4 \\ge 0$ and $3 \\ge 0$), this is a basic feasible solution (BFS). The full solution vector is $x = (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)^T = (4, 3, 0, 0)^T$.\n\nNext, we check for unboundedness. According to the fundamental principles of the simplex method, the primal LP is unbounded if there exists a nonbasic variable $x_j$ (where $j \\in \\mathcal{N}$) such that:\n1.  Increasing $x_j$ from $0$ increases the objective function. For a maximization problem, this means its reduced cost $\\bar{c}_j$ must be positive.\n2.  As $x_j$ increases, the solution remains feasible. This means that all current basic variables $x_B$ remain non-negative.\n\nThe reduced cost for a nonbasic variable $x_j$ is given by the formula $\\bar{c}_j = c_j - c_B^T A_B^{-1} a_j$, where $a_j$ is the $j$-th column of $A$. Let's first compute the inverse of the basis matrix $A_B$:\n$$\n\\det(A_B) = (2)(1) - (0)(1) = 2\n$$\n$$\nA_B^{-1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ -1/2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we compute the reduced costs for the nonbasic variables $x_3$ and $x_4$. It is efficient to first compute the vector $y^T = c_B^T A_B^{-1}$:\n$$\ny^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ -1/2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3/2 + 1/2 & 0 - 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe reduced costs are $\\bar{c}_j = c_j - y^T a_j$:\nFor $j=3$: $a_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$$\n\\bar{c}_3 = c_3 - y^T a_3 = 0 - \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = 0 - (2 \\cdot 1 - 1 \\cdot 2) = 0 - 0 = 0\n$$\nFor $j=4$: $a_4 = \\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$$\n\\bar{c}_4 = c_4 - y^T a_4 = 2 - \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix} = 2 - (2 \\cdot (-4) - 1 \\cdot (-3)) = 2 - (-8 + 3) = 2 - (-5) = 7\n$$\nSince $\\bar{c}_4 = 7 > 0$, increasing $x_4$ will increase the objective function. So, $j=4$ is our candidate nonbasic index.\n\nNow we check the second condition. We consider a move from the current BFS $x^{(0)} = (4, 3, 0, 0)^T$ in a direction where $x_4$ increases by a parameter $t \\ge 0$, i.e., $x_4(t) = t$. The other nonbasic variable $x_3$ remains $0$. The basic variables $x_B(t)$ adjust to maintain feasibility:\n$A_B x_B(t) + a_4 x_4(t) = b \\implies A_B x_B(t) = b - a_4 t$.\n$x_B(t) = A_B^{-1}(b - a_4 t) = A_B^{-1}b - (A_B^{-1}a_4)t$.\nSince $x_B = A_B^{-1}b$ is our current basic feasible solution, we have $x_B(t) = x_B - (A_B^{-1}a_4)t$.\nFor the solution to remain feasible for all $t > 0$, we must have $x_B(t) \\ge 0$. As $x_B > 0$, this condition is guaranteed if all components of the vector update $-A_B^{-1}a_4$ are non-negative, which is equivalent to every component of the vector $d_j = A_B^{-1}a_j$ being non-positive.

The basic variables evolve as:\n$$\nx_B(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} - t \\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 + 2t \\\\ 3 + t \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor any $t \\ge 0$, both $x_1(t) = 4+2t$ and $x_2(t) = 3+t$ are non-negative.\nThe full solution vector along the ray is $x(t) = (4+2t, 3+t, 0, t)^T$. This path is feasible for all $t \\ge 0$.\n\nThe problem is unbounded. The ray of unboundedness starts at $x^{(0)} = (4, 3, 0, 0)^T$ and extends in the direction $d = (2, 1, 0, 1)^T$.\nThe final step is to compute the rate of increase in the objective function $z = c^T x$ along this ray. The objective value as a function of the parameter $t$ is $z(t) = c^T x(t)$:\n$$\nz(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -1 & 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 4+2t \\\\ 3+t \\\\ 0 \\\\ t \\end{pmatrix} = 3(4+2t) - 1(3+t) + 2t\n$$\n$$\nz(t) = 12 + 6t - 3 - t + 2t = (12-3) + (6-1+2)t = 9 + 7t\n$$\nThe value of the objective at the BFS is $z(0) = 9$. The objective increases linearly with $t$. The rate of increase of the objective per unit parameter $t$ (which corresponds to a unit increase in $x_4$) is the derivative of $z(t)$ with respect to $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{dz}{dt} = 7\n$$\nAs established by the theory, this rate of increase is precisely the reduced cost of the entering variable, $\\bar{c}_4$.\n\nThe exact scalar rate of increase is $7$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{7}\n$$", "id": "3154236"}]}
