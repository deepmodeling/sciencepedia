The game is played on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where vertices represent technologies and directed edges represent dependencies.\n\nThe available technologies and their dependencies are as follows:\n- **Fusion Reactor (T):** requires Sustained Burn (E) and Tritium Breeding (F).\n- **Sustained Burn (E):** requires Plasma Confinement (C) and Superconducting Magnets (D).\n- **Tritium Breeding (F):** requires Superconducting Magnets (D).\n- **Plasma Confinement (C):** requires Toroidal Coils (A) and Poloidal Coils (B).\n- **Toroidal Coils (A), Poloidal Coils (B), and Superconducting Magnets (D)** are foundational technologies with no prerequisites.\n\nThe rules of the game are:\n1. Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice making the first move.\n2. On any given turn, a player claims one unclaimed technology.\n3. A technology can only be claimed if all of its immediate prerequisites have already been claimed. The prerequisite technologies can be claimed by either player.\n4.

The game ends immediately when $T$ is claimed.\n\nWe first identify the necessary technologies that must be claimed before $T$ becomes available:\n- Since $T$ requires $E$ and $F$, both $E$ and $F$ must be claimed before $T$ can be claimed.\n- $F$ requires $D$, so $D$ must be claimed before $F$.\n- $E$ requires $C$ and $D$, so $C$ and $D$ must be claimed before $E$.\n- $C$ requires $A$ and $B$, so $A$ and $B$ must be claimed before $C$.\n\nThus, the set $\\{A,B,C,D,E,F\\}$ must all be claimed before $T$ is available. These are six distinct technologies, and only one may be claimed per move. Therefore, at least $6$ moves are required before $T$ can possibly be claimed. Moreover, there are no other technologies to claim besides these six before $T$ becomes available, so the game necessarily proceeds by claiming exactly these six in some order during the first $6$ moves.\n\nConsequently:\n- $T$ cannot be claimed before move $7$.\n- After $6$ moves, all of $A,B,C,D,E,F$ have been claimed, so both prerequisites $E$ and $F$ of $T$ are satisfied, making $T$ available on the next move.\n- On move $7$, the player to move can claim $T$ and immediately wins.\n\nSince Alice moves on moves $1,3,5,7$, she will be the player to move on the $7$-th move, at which point $T$ is first available. Hence Alice claims $T$ on move $7$ and wins, regardless of the order in which the prerequisites were claimed.\n\nTherefore, Alice has a winning strategy, and options B, C, and D are false: Bob cannot force a win; the winner does not depend on Alice’s first move; and the game cannot continue indefinitely because it must end by move $7$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1416890"}, {"introduction": "While some games have outcomes determined by their global structure, many others hinge on the clever strategic choices players make turn-by-turn.

Once a vertex is claimed by a player, it cannot be chosen again by either player. A player wins as soon as their personal collection of claimed vertices contains an independent set of size $k$. An independent set is a set of vertices where no two vertices are connected by an edge. If all vertices are claimed and no player has achieved the goal, the game is a draw.\n\nConsider an instance of this game played on a 7-cycle graph $G$, where the vertex set is $V = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$ and the edge set is $E = \\{\\{1,2\\}, \\{2,3\\}, \\{3,4\\}, \\{4,5\\}, \\{5,6\\}, \\{6,7\\}, \\{7,1\\}\\}$.

Therefore, choosing $3$ gives A a forced win.\n\nFor completeness, we verify that the other listed first moves do not guarantee a win for A under optimal B play:\n- If A chooses $2$, B can reply with $3$. Then A cannot use $1$ anymore to reach $3$ (both $S_{1}$ and $S_{6}$ require $3$), and the only remaining triple available through $2$ is $S_{5}=\\{2,5,7\\}$. B can always block this by taking whichever of $\\{5,7\\}$ A has not yet taken, so A has no forced win.\n- If A chooses $5$, then the immediate single threat is $S_{1}=\\{1,3,5\\}$; B blocks by taking $3$. After that, A’s only remaining triple through $5$ is $S_{5}=\\{2,5,7\\}$, which B can always keep blocking as above; thus no forced win for A.\n- If A chooses $7$, B again replies with $3$, which eliminates both $S_{1}$ and $S_{6}$ (the only triples containing $1$ that A could aim for without $4$). The only remaining triple through $7$ is $S_{5}=\\{2,5,7\\}$, which B can block as before; hence no forced win for A.\n\nThus exactly choosing vertex $3$ gives Player A a winning strategy; the other listed moves do not guarantee a win, and Player B does not have a winning strategy overall in this position.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1416871"}, {"introduction": "We now advance to a more powerful and general method for analyzing a special category of games known as impartial games, where the available moves depend only on the state of the game, not on which player is moving.

Some lots might already be zoned as either 'Residential' (R) or 'Industrial' (I), while others are empty. The players take turns, with the Planner moving first. A move consists of choosing one empty lot and zoning it as either 'R' or 'I'.\n\nHowever, a move is only legal if it does not create an adjacency between a 'Residential' and an 'Industrial' zone. For instance, if lot 4 is zoned 'R', a player cannot zone lot 3 or lot 5 as 'I'. If a player attempts to make a move that would create such an adjacency, the move is forbidden.\n\nThe game ends when a player cannot make any legal moves on their turn.

The initial configuration $R\\,\\_\\,\\_\\,I\\,\\_\\,\\_\\,R$ consists of two segments of length $2$ with opposite endpoints: lots $2$–$3$ are between $R$ and $I$, and lots $5$–$6$ are between $I$ and $R$. The game is impartial (both players have the same legal moves from any position) and uses normal play; therefore Sprague–Grundy theory applies. The overall Grundy value is the nim-sum of the Grundy values of the independent segments.\n\nDefine $g_{E}(n)$ as the Grundy number of a segment of $n$ consecutive empty lots with equal endpoints, and $g_{O}(n)$ for opposite endpoints. Base cases: $g_{E}(0)=0$ and $g_{O}(0)=0$ (no moves).\n\nFor $n=1$:\n- Equal endpoints: the unique legal move is to place the same zone as the endpoints, splitting into two empty segments of length $0$, so the option value is $0 \\oplus 0=0$, hence $g_{E}(1)=\\operatorname{mex}\\{0\\}=1$.\n- Opposite endpoints: placing either zone would be adjacent to an opposite zone on one side, so no legal moves exist; hence $g_{O}(1)=0$.\n\nFor $n=2$:\n- Equal endpoints: at $j=1$ only the matching endpoint zone is legal, yielding left $0$ with equal endpoints and right $1$ with equal endpoints, so the option value is $0 \\oplus g_{E}(1)=1$. At $j=2$ similarly the option value is $g_{E}(1)\\oplus 0=1$. Therefore $g_{E}(2)=\\operatorname{mex}\\{1\\}=0$.\n- Opposite endpoints: at $j=1$ only the left endpoint’s zone is legal, splitting into left $0$ with equal endpoints and right $1$ with opposite endpoints, giving $0 \\oplus g_{O}(1)=0$. At $j=2$ only the right endpoint’s zone is legal, splitting into left $1$ with opposite endpoints and right $0$ with equal endpoints, giving $g_{O}(1)\\oplus 0=0$. Therefore $g_{O}(2)=\\operatorname{mex}\\{0\\}=1$.\n\nThus each of the two segments in the initial position has Grundy value $g_{O}(2)=1$, and the overall Grundy value is $1 \\oplus 1=0$. A nim-sum of $0$ is a previous-player win (a $\\mathcal{P}$-position); hence the next player (the Planner) is in a losing position with optimal play by the Disruptor. Concretely, any legal opening move by the Planner is to fill one of lots $2,3,5,6$ with the only allowed zone at that lot; this immediately blocks the other cell in that segment and leaves the other segment unchanged with $n=2$ and opposite endpoints. The Disruptor then fills the corresponding cell in the other segment (the only legal move there), after which no legal moves remain, so the Planner has no move and loses. Therefore the correct statement is that the Disruptor has a winning strategy regardless of the Planner’s first move.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1416843"}]}
