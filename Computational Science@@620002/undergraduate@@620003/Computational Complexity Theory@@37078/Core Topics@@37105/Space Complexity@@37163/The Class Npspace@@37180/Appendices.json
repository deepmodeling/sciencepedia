Algorithms in this class operate with a remarkably small amount of working memory, often too little to even store a significant portion of the input. This exercise [@problem_id:1453626] delves into how such algorithms compensate by using a small, fixed number of 'pointers' or indices to cleverly navigate the input data and verify a property, giving you a tangible feel for the $\\text{NLOGSPACE}$ model.", "problem": "In the field of data transmission and verification, redundancy is often used to protect against errors. Consider a simplified protocol where a secret key, which is a non-empty string of characters $v$, is transmitted by sending two separate, identical copies of $v$. The transmission channel, however, may interleave the parts of these two copies. The result is a single received string $w$. A system at the receiving end must verify if $w$ could have been generated by this process.\n\nFormally, we say a string $w$ is an interleaving of two strings $x$ and $y$ if the characters of $w$ can be partitioned into two subsequences that, when read in order, form precisely $x$ and $y$. For example, `axbyc` is an interleaving of `abc` and `xy`.\n\nLet the language **TWIN_INTERLEAVE** be the set of all strings $w$ over a given alphabet $\\Sigma$ such that $w$ is an interleaving of $v$ and $v$ for some non-empty string $v$. For example, `ab` is not in the language, but `aabb` is (for $v$=`ab`), and `abac` is not.\n\nIt is a known result in computational complexity theory that **TWIN_INTERLEAVE** can be decided by a nondeterministic Turing machine using logarithmic space on its work tape relative to the input size. This complexity class is known as **NL**, or Nondeterministic Logarithmic-space (**NL** = **NSPACE**($\\log n$)).\n\nLet $n$ be the length of the input string $w$. Which of the following options best describes the essential storage requirements on the work tape for a nondeterministic Turing machine to decide membership in **TWIN_INTERLEAVE** within this logarithmic space bound?\n\nA. A single counter capable of storing any integer value from $0$ to $n$.\n\nB. A fixed number of pointers, where each pointer is a variable that stores an index into the input string $w$ (i.e., a value from $1$ to $n$).\n\nC. A temporary buffer to hold a substring of $w$ of length up to $n/2$.\n\nD. A memory segment large enough to store the full candidate string $v$.\n\nE. Two stacks, where the total number of symbols stored across both stacks can be up to $n$.", "solution": "We formalize the decision task as follows: given input $w$ of length $n$, decide whether there exist increasing index sequences $i_{1}<i_{2}<\\cdots<i_{m}$ and $j_{1}<j_{2}<\\cdots<j_{m}$ such that $n=2m$, $\\{i_{1},\\ldots,i_{m}\\}\\cup\\{j_{1},\\ldots,j_{m}\\}=\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$ (disjoint union), and $w[i_{t}]=w[j_{t}]$ for all $t\\in\\{1,\\ldots,m\\}$. This expresses that $w$ is an interleaving of $v$ and $v$ for some non-empty $v$ of length $m$.\n\nA nondeterministic Turing machine operating in space $O(\\log n)$ can verify such a certificate by iterating $t=1$ to $m$ and nondeterministically guessing the next pair $(i_{t},j_{t})$ with $i_{t}$ and $j_{t}$ strictly increasing relative to $(i_{t-1},j_{t-1})$, while checking $w[i_{t}]=w[j_{t}]$ directly on the read-only input tape. To perform these checks, the machine must:\n- Store a constant number of indices into $w$ (e.g., the current $i_{t}$ and $j_{t}$, and possibly the previous ones for monotonicity). Each index is an integer in $\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$ and can be stored in $\\lceil \\log_{2} n \\rceil$ bits.\n- Move the input head to the positions indicated by these indices and compare the symbols. The alphabet is fixed, so symbol comparisons use constant space.\n\nHence the essential storage on the work tape is a fixed number of variables that each hold an index from $1$ to $n$, totaling $O(\\log n)$ bits. This matches the standard characterization of **NL** computations where machines keep a constant number of pointers into the input and reuse them via multiple passes.\n\nWe now assess the options:\n- A. A single counter storing a value from $0$ to $n$ uses $O(\\log n)$ bits, but in general one needs at least two independent indices simultaneously (for the two subsequences) to compare $w[i_{t}]$ and $w[j_{t}]$ while maintaining order constraints. A single counter is not an adequate general description of the necessary storage.\n- B. A fixed number of pointers (indices into $w$) precisely captures the **NL** strategy: store $O(1)$ indices, each needing $O(\\log n)$ bits, for total $O(\\log n)$ space.\n- C. A buffer of length up to $n/2$ is $\\Theta(n)$ space, exceeding $O(\\log n)$.\n- D. Storing the full candidate $v$ uses $\\Theta(n)$ space, exceeding $O(\\log n)$.\n- E. Two stacks with up to $n$ symbols total is $\\Theta(n)$ space, exceeding $O(\\log n)$.\n\nTherefore, the essential work-tape storage is captured by option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1453626"}, {"introduction": "Having seen how nondeterministic space-bounded machines can work, a natural question arises: what is the deterministic cost of simulating such computations?
