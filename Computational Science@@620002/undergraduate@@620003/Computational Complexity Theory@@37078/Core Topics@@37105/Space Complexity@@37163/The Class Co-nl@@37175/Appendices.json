This exercise introduces a classic example of such a problem, fitting naturally into the complexity class co-NL.

Consider the following decision problem, which we will call `UNIVERSAL-SAFENET`.\n\nYou are given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) $G = (V, E)$, which represents a network of one-way data channels between servers. You are also given a starting server $s \\in V$ and a special subset of servers $T \\subseteq V$ that are designated as \"secure terminals\". The problem asks the following question: Is it true that every possible data path starting from server $s$ and continuing as far as possible must end at a secure terminal?\n\nA data path is a sequence of connected servers. A path \"ends\" when it reaches a server with no outgoing channels (a sink in the graph).\n\nFormally, the `UNIVERSAL-SAFENET` problem is:\n**Input:** A tuple $(G, s, T)$ where $G=(V,E)$ is a DAG, $s \\in V$, and $T \\subseteq V$.\n**Question:** Does every maximal path starting at vertex $s$ end in a vertex belonging to the set $T$?\n\nBased on the standard definitions of complexity classes, which of the following statements provides the most accurate and immediate classification for the `UNIVERSAL-SAFENET` problem?\n\nThe complexity classes mentioned are:\n- L: Logarithmic space on a deterministic Turing machine.\n- NL: Nondeterministic Logarithmic-space.\n- co-NL: The class of problems whose complement is in NL.\n- PSPACE: Polynomial space on a deterministic Turing machine.\n\nA. `UNIVERSAL-SAFENET` is in L, because a log-space machine can deterministically traverse all paths from $s$.\n\nB.

The complexity class NL is naturally suited for \"exists\" (existential) questions, where a nondeterministic machine can guess a certificate (like a path) and verify it. Universal questions are often characteristic of co-classes.\n\n**Step 2: Define and Analyze the Complement Problem**\nTo determine if `UNIVERSAL-SAFENET` is in co-NL, we must analyze its complement, which we can call `NON-UNIVERSAL-SAFENET`.\n- A \"yes\" instance of `UNIVERSAL-SAFENET` means all maximal paths from $s$ end in $T$.\n- A \"no\" instance of `UNIVERSAL-SAFENET` means there is at least one maximal path from $s$ that does *not* end in $T$.\n\nTherefore, the complement problem `NON-UNIVERSAL-SAFENET` is:\n**Question:** Does there *exist* at least one maximal path starting at $s$ that ends in a vertex $v \\notin T$?\n\n**Step 3: Show the Complement Problem is in NL**\nWe now show that `NON-UNIVERSAL-SAFENET` can be solved by a Nondeterministic Turing Machine (NTM) using only logarithmic space. The input size $n$ is proportional to $|V| + |E|$. An algorithm for the NTM is as follows:\n\n1.  Initialize a \"current vertex\" pointer, `curr`, to the start vertex $s$. This pointer requires $O(\\log|V|)$ space to store.\n2.  At each step, if `curr` has outgoing edges, nondeterministically choose one of its neighbors, say $v'$, and update `curr` to $v'$.\n3.  Repeat this process. Since the graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), we are guaranteed not to enter a cycle. A path cannot have more than $|V|-1$ edges. A counter can be used to track path length to ensure termination, also using $O(\\log|V|)$ space.\n4.  The process stops when `curr` points to a vertex that is a sink (it has no outgoing edges). Let this sink vertex be $v_{end}$.\n5.  The machine then checks if $v_{end} \\in T$.\n    - If $v_{end} \\notin T$, the machine has successfully found a path that violates the condition of `UNIVERSAL-SAFENET`. In this case, the NTM accepts.\n    - If $v_{end} \\in T$, this particular nondeterministic branch of computation has failed to find a counterexample, so it rejects.\n\nBy the definition of nondeterministic computation, the NTM accepts the input if *any* of its computation branches accept. This happens precisely when there exists a maximal path from $s$ that ends outside $T$. The space used is for storing the current vertex and a counter, which is $O(\\log|V|)$, and therefore $O(\\log n)$. Thus, `NON-UNIVERSAL-SAFENET` is in NL.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Classification of the Original Problem**\nSince the complement of `UNIVERSAL-SAFENET` is in NL, by the very definition of the class co-NL, the `UNIVERSAL-SAFENET` problem is in co-NL.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Given Options**\n\n*   **A. `UNIVERSAL-SAFENET` is in L, because a log-space machine can deterministically traverse all paths from $s$.**\n    This is incorrect. A deterministic machine would need to keep track of which branches of the path it has explored, which generally requires more than logarithmic space (e.g., a stack for a depth-first search).\n\n*   **B. The complement of `UNIVERSAL-SAFENET` is in NL, which by definition means `UNIVERSAL-SAFENET` is in co-NL.**\n    This is correct. Our analysis in Steps 2-4 demonstrates this exact line of reasoning. This is the most accurate and direct classification based on the problem's universal quantifier structure.\n\n*   **C. `UNIVERSAL-SAFENET` is in NL, because a nondeterministic machine can guess a path from $s$ and verify that it ends in a secure terminal from the set $T$.**\n    This is incorrect. This logic would solve the problem \"Does there *exist* a path from $s$ that ends in $T$?\" It does not verify that *all* paths do. Just because one path is \"safe\" does not mean all paths are.\n\n*   **D. `UNIVERSAL-SAFENET` is PSPACE-complete because checking all paths can lead to an exponential number of routes to explore.**\n    This is incorrect. While there can be an exponential number of paths, the problem is not that hard. It can be solved in polynomial time on a deterministic machine (e.g., using dynamic programming or graph traversal), so it is in P. Since P $\\subseteq$ PSPACE, it cannot be PSPACE-complete unless P = PSPACE. Furthermore, our analysis shows it is in co-NL, which is a much smaller class than PSPACE.\n\nTherefore, the reasoning presented in option B is the most faithful and accurate classification based on the problem's definition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1451607"}, {"introduction": "The quintessential problem in the class NL is `ST-CONNECTIVITY`, which asks if a path exists between two points.

Each edge $e \\in E$ has an associated positive integer weight, $w(e)$. An instance $\\langle G, s, t, k \\rangle$ is defined as a \"yes\" instance if and only if there is no path from vertex $s$ to vertex $t$ that is composed exclusively of edges $e$ for which the weight $w(e)$ is strictly less than $k$.\n\nFor complexity analysis, assume the input is encoded efficiently. For instance, the graph $G$ is given by an adjacency list, and all integers (vertex labels, weights, and $k$) are represented in binary. The total input size, denoted by $N$, is polynomial in $n$ and the number of bits required to represent the maximum weight and $k$.\n\nWhich of the following represents the smallest complexity class that is known to contain the `WEIGHT-CONSTRAINED-UNREACHABILITY` problem?\n\nA.

PSPACE (the class of problems solvable in Polynomial Space on a deterministic Turing machine)", "solution": "The goal is to determine the smallest known complexity class that contains the `WEIGHT-CONSTRAINED-UNREACHABILITY` problem.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the problem definition. A \"yes\" instance corresponds to the condition that there is *no* path from a starting vertex $s$ to a target vertex $t$ using only a specific subset of edges. The allowed edges are those with a weight $w(e)$ strictly less than the given threshold $k$.\n\nThis problem can be simplified by relating it to a more standard graph problem. Let's construct a new graph $G'=(V, E')$ from the input graph $G=(V, E)$. The vertex set $V$ remains the same. The edge set $E'$ consists only of those edges from $E$ that satisfy the weight constraint. Formally, $E' = \\{ e \\in E \\mid w(e) < k \\}$.\n\nWith this new graph $G'$, the `WEIGHT-CONSTRAINED-UNREACHABILITY` problem on the input $\\langle G, s, t, k \\rangle$ becomes equivalent to answering the question: \"Is there no path from $s$ to $t$ in the graph $G'$?\"\n\nThis new problem is the complement of the standard `PATH` problem, also known as `ST-CONNECTIVITY` or `STCON`. The `PATH` problem asks if there *is* a path between two specified vertices in a directed graph. The problem we have formulated is `NO-PATH` on the graph $G'$.\n\nThe `PATH` problem for directed graphs is the canonical complete problem for the complexity class NL (Nondeterministic Logarithmic Space). This means that `PATH` is in NL, and any other problem in NL can be reduced to `PATH` using a logarithmic-space reduction.\n\nThe class co-NL is defined as the set of languages whose complements are in NL. Since our problem, `WEIGHT-CONSTRAINED-UNREACHABILITY`, is equivalent to `NO-PATH` (the complement of `PATH`), and `PATH` is in NL, our problem is, by definition, in co-NL.\n\nA cornerstone result in complexity theory is the Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem, which proves that NL is closed under complementation. This means that NL = co-NL.\n\nTherefore, because our problem is in co-NL, it must also be in NL. The process of effectively using $G'$ does not increase the space complexity. A nondeterministic Turing machine operating in logarithmic space can solve this problem. When exploring a path from $s$, for each edge it considers using, it can read the edge's weight from the input tape and compare it to $k$. This requires only logarithmic space to store pointers to the input and the value of $k$. The algorithm for `NO-PATH` (which, by NL=co-NL, exists as an NL algorithm) can thus be run on the \"virtual\" graph $G'$ without explicitly constructing it, staying within the logarithmic space bound.\n\nNow we must evaluate the given options to find the smallest class known to contain the problem.

However, we are looking for the smallest such class, and NL is a proper subset of P unless P=NL, which is an open question but widely believed to be false.\nB. co-NP: Since NL ⊆ P ⊆ co-NP, the problem is in co-NP. This is not the smallest class.\nC. L: The `PATH` problem is NL-complete and is not known to be in L. It is conjectured that L ≠ NL. Thus, L is not known to contain this problem.\nD.

The `UNEQUAL-REACH` problem is the set of instances $(G_1, G_2, s_1, s_2)$ for which $|R(G_1, s_1)| \\neq |R(G_2, s_2)|$.\n\nTo classify `UNEQUAL-REACH`, let's first consider its complement, which we'll call `EQUAL-REACH`.\nThe `EQUAL-REACH` problem is the set of instances $(G_1, G_2, s_1, s_2)$ for which $|R(G_1, s_1)| = |R(G_2, s_2)|$.\nBy definition, if we can show that `EQUAL-REACH` is in the class NL (Nondeterministic Logarithmic Space), then `UNEQUAL-REACH` must be in the class co-NL.\n\nOur goal is to construct a non-deterministic Turing machine (NTM) that solves `EQUAL-REACH` using only logarithmic space, $O(\\log n)$, where $n$ is the total size of the input graphs.\n\nThe high-level strategy for our NTM is as follows:\n1.  Non-deterministically guess an integer $k$, where $0 \\leq k \\leq \\max(|V_1|, |V_2|)$. This integer $k$ is our guess for the common number of reachable vertices. Storing $k$ requires $O(\\log |V|)$ space, which is within our logarithmic space bound.\n2.  Verify that the number of vertices reachable from $s_1$ in $G_1$ is exactly $k$.\n3.  Verify that the number of vertices reachable from $s_2$ in $G_2$ is exactly $k$.\n4.  If both verifications are successful, the machine accepts. If any verification fails, this non-deterministic path rejects.\n\nThe machine accepts the input if there exists *any* guess for $k$ for which both verification steps succeed. This is only possible if the number of reachable vertices is indeed the same in both graphs.\n\nNow, we must show that the verification step, \"verify that $|R(G, s)| = k$\", can be performed in NL. Let's call this subproblem `EXACTLY-k-REACH`. This subproblem can be broken down into two conditions that must both be true:\n(a) The number of reachable vertices is at least $k$, i.e., $|R(G, s)| \\geq k$.\n(b) The number of reachable vertices is at most $k$, i.e., $|R(G, s)| \\leq k$.\n\nLet's analyze the complexity of checking each condition.\n\n**Condition (a): Verifying $|R(G, s)| \\geq k$.**\nThe language is $L_{\\geq k} = \\{ (G, s, k) \\mid |R(G,s)| \\ge k \\}$. An NTM can decide this as follows:\n1.  Non-deterministically guess $k$ distinct vertices from $V$: $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_k$.\n2.  For each guessed vertex $v_i$ (from $i=1$ to $k$):\n    a. Non-deterministically guess a path from $s$ to $v_i$.\n    b. Verify that the guessed path is valid in $G$.\n3.  If all $k$ vertices are distinct and a valid path is found for each, the machine accepts. Otherwise, it rejects on this path.\n\nThe space required is logarithmic. We need to store counters for loops (up to $k$ and path length, both $\\le |V|$), and the identifiers for the current vertices being checked. All these fit within $O(\\log |V| + \\log |E|)$ space. Thus, verifying $|R(G, s)| \\geq k$ is in NL.\n\n**Condition (b): Verifying $|R(G, s)| \\leq k$.**\nThe language is $L_{\\leq k} = \\{ (G, s, k) \\mid |R(G,s)| \\le k \\}$. Consider the complement of this language, $\\overline{L_{\\leq k}}$.\n$\\overline{L_{\\leq k}} = \\{ (G, s, k) \\mid |R(G,s)| > k \\} = \\{ (G, s, k) \\mid |R(G,s)| \\ge k+1 \\}$.\nThis complement is exactly the language $L_{\\geq k+1}$. From our analysis of condition (a), we know that $L_{\\geq k+1}$ is in NL.\nTherefore, $L_{\\leq k}$ is in co-NL.\n\nThis is where a landmark result in complexity theory, the Immerman-Szelepcsényi theorem, is crucial. The theorem states that NL = co-NL. This means that any problem in co-NL is also in NL. Since we've shown that verifying $|R(G, s)| \\leq k$ is in co-NL, by this theorem, it must also be in NL.\n\n**Conclusion for `EQUAL-REACH`:**\nThe problem of verifying $|R(G, s)| = k$ requires checking that both $|R(G, s)| \\geq k$ (which is in NL) and $|R(G, s)| \\leq k$ (which is in NL due to NL=co-NL) hold true. The class NL is closed under intersection, meaning if two languages are in NL, their intersection is also in NL. An NTM can simply run the machine for the first language, and if it accepts, run the machine for the second language. Thus, `EXACTLY-k-REACH` is in NL.\n\nSince the verification step of our main algorithm for `EQUAL-REACH` is in NL, and the overall algorithm is just a non-deterministic guess of $k$ followed by two such verifications, the entire `EQUAL-REACH` problem is in NL.\n\n**Final Classification of `UNEQUAL-REACH`:**\nSince `EQUAL-REACH` is in NL, its complement, `UNEQUAL-REACH`, is by definition in co-NL.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\nA.
