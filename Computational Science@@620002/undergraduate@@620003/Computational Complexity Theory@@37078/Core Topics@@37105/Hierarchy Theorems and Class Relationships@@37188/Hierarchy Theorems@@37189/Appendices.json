This problem explores the time complexity of a specific diagonalization construction for Alternating Turing Machines (ATMs). An ATM is a variant of a non-deterministic Turing machine with its states partitioned into existential and universal states.\n\nAssume a standard binary encoding scheme where any ATM $M$ can be uniquely represented by a string $\\langle M \\rangle$. We are provided with a special universal ATM, denoted as $U$. For any given ATM $M$ and an input string $w$, the machine $U$ can simulate the computation of $M$ on $w$. This simulation incurs a specific time overhead: if $M$ halts on an input of length $n$ in $T(n)$ steps, the simulation on $U$ requires $T_{sim}(n) = c \\cdot T(n) \\log_2(T(n))$ steps, where $c$ is a positive constant and all logarithms are base 2.\n\nNow, consider a carefully constructed ATM, which we will call $D$. The behavior of $D$ on an input string $x$ of length $n=|x|$ is as follows:\n1.  First, $D$ performs a check to determine if $x$ is a valid encoding of an ATM. This verification process takes exactly $n^2$ steps. If $x$ is not a valid encoding, $D$ halts and rejects.\n2.  If $x$ is a valid encoding of an ATM, which we denote as $M_x$, then $D$ uses the universal machine $U$ to simulate the execution of $M_x$ on the input string $x$ itself.\n3.  After the simulation of $M_x(x)$ is complete, $D$ inverts the result: if the simulation accepts, $D$ rejects; if the simulation rejects, $D$ accepts. This final inversion step takes a negligible constant number of steps.\n\nWe are applying this diagonalization argument to a specific class of polynomial-time ATMs. Every machine $M_x$ from this class (i.e., any machine for which $x = \\langle M_x \\rangle$ is a valid encoding) has a worst-case running time on an input of length $m$ that is bounded by the function $T_x(m) = m^{\\log_2(|\\langle M_x \\rangle|)}$.\n\nYour task is to determine the function $g(n)$ that represents the dominant term in the worst-case running time $T_D(n)$ of the machine $D$ on an input of length $n$, for large $n$.
