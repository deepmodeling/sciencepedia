The corresponding Resonance Values are 17, 8, and 42.\nLet's calculate the sum:\nSum = $17 + 8 + 42 = 25 + 42 = 67$.\nThis sum matches the required target value. Therefore, this is a valid combination for forging the Amulet.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Option B**\nThe combination is {Shard of the Crimson Star, Shard of the Obsidian Void}. The corresponding Resonance Values are 17 and 42.\nLet's calculate the sum:\nSum = $17 + 42 = 59$.\nThis sum is not equal to 67.

However, our analysis of Option A in Step 1 showed that a valid combination exists.
