A distribution is considered 'perfectly balanced' if the sum of the computational weights of the tasks assigned to each pipeline is exactly equal. For a given set of tasks, this is only possible if the set can be partitioned into two subsets of equal total weight, a classic problem in computer science.\n\nYou are given a set of four tasks whose computational weights are defined in terms of a positive integer parameter $k$. The set of weights is $W = \\{k, 2k, 3k-5, k^2 - 10k + 40\\}$. The system is being tested for integer values of the parameter $k$ where $k \\ge 10$.

For this set to be partitionable into two subsets of equal weight, let's call them $S_1$ and $S_2$, the sum of weights in each subset must be equal. Let $T$ be the total sum of all weights in $S$. A necessary condition for a partition to exist is that $T$ must be an even number, and the sum of each subset must be exactly $T/2$.\n\nThe problem refers to another condition involving the largest element in the set. Let $m_{max}$ be the largest weight in the set $S$. If we try to form a partition, $m_{max}$ must belong to one of the subsets, say $S_1$. For the sum of weights in $S_1$ to be $T/2$, the other elements in $S_1$ must sum to $T/2 - m_{max}$. Since all weights are positive, this is only possible if $T/2 - m_{max} \\ge 0$, which implies $m_{max} \\le T/2$.\n\nTherefore, a necessary condition for a partition to exist is that the largest element must be less than or equal to half of the total sum.

Let's compare the elements:\n- Comparing $k^2 - 10k + 40$ with $3k-5$: Consider the difference $f(k) = (k^2 - 10k + 40) - (3k-5) = k^2 - 13k + 45$. The discriminant of this quadratic is $\\Delta = (-13)^2 - 4(1)(45) = 169 - 180 = -11$. Since the leading coefficient is positive and the discriminant is negative, $f(k)$ is always positive. Thus, $k^2 - 10k + 40 > 3k-5$ for all $k$.\n- Since $k \\ge 10$, we have $3k-5 > 2k$ (as $k>5$) and $2k > k$.\n- By transitivity, $k^2 - 10k + 40$ is the largest element for all $k$, and specifically for $k \\ge 10$.\nSo, $m_{max}(k) = k^2 - 10k + 40$.\n\nNext, we calculate the total sum of the weights, $T(k)$:\n$T(k) = k + 2k + (3k-5) + (k^2 - 10k + 40)$\n$T(k) = k^2 + (1+2+3-10)k + (-5+40)$\n$T(k) = k^2 - 4k + 35$\n\nNow we apply the impossibility condition: $m_{max}(k) > T(k)/2$.\n$k^2 - 10k + 40 > \\frac{k^2 - 4k + 35}{2}$\n\nTo solve this inequality, we multiply both sides by 2:\n$2(k^2 - 10k + 40) > k^2 - 4k + 35$\n$2k^2 - 20k + 80 > k^2 - 4k + 35$\n\nRearrange the terms to form a standard quadratic inequality:\n$2k^2 - k^2 - 20k + 4k + 80 - 35 > 0$\n$k^2 - 16k + 45 > 0$\n\nTo find when this inequality holds, we first find the roots of the corresponding equation $k^2 - 16k + 45 = 0$.

By finding an instance where this intuitive approach fails, you will gain a deeper appreciation for why problems like the Partition Problem are classified as \"hard\" and why more sophisticated algorithms are necessary [@problem_id:1460724].", "problem": "The PARTITION problem in computer science asks whether a given multiset of positive integers, $S$, can be partitioned into two subsets, $S_1$ and $S_2$, such that the sum of the numbers in $S_1$ is equal to the sum of the numbers in $S_2$. Such a partition is called a \"perfect partition\". The PARTITION problem is NP-hard, meaning there is no known algorithm that can solve it efficiently for all inputs.\n\nA common approach to this problem is a greedy heuristic known as the \"largest-first\" method.
