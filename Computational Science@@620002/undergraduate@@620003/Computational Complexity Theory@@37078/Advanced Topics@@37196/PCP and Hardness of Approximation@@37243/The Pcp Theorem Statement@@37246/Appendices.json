Define a verifier $V$ that, on input $x$, uses $r(n)=0$ random bits and makes $q(n)=0$ queries to the proof (i.e., it ignores the proof entirely), and simply runs $A(x)$ and outputs its decision. Completeness: if $x \\in L$, there exists a proof $\\pi$ (indeed, any $\\pi$) such that $V$ accepts with probability $1$, since $V$ is deterministic and equals $A$. Soundness: if $x \\notin L$, for any proof $\\pi'$, $V$ accepts with probability $0 \\leq \\frac{1}{2}$, again because $V$ is deterministic and equals $A$.

Mastering this concept is key to appreciating how probabilistic checks can become nearly as powerful as deterministic ones.

So, we take $P(\\text{accept}) = s$.\n\nThe protocol involves running the verifier $k$ times independently. The overall protocol accepts a false statement only if all $k$ trials result in an acceptance. Let $A_i$ be the event that the $i$-th trial incorrectly accepts. The event of an overall incorrect acceptance, $A_{\\text{overall}}$, is the intersection of these individual events:\n$$A_{\\text{overall}} = A_1 \\cap A_2 \\cap \\dots \\cap A_k$$\n\nSince each trial is independent, the probability of the intersection of these events is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$P(A_{\\text{overall}}) = P(A_1) \\times P(A_2) \\times \\dots \\times P(A_k)$$\nIn our worst-case analysis, $P(A_i) = s$ for all $i=1, \\dots, k$.

Since $r(n)=0$, the verifier $V$ uses no random bits, hence is deterministic on input $x$ and oracle access to $\\pi$.

Since $q(n)=O(1)$, there exists a constant $K$ (independent of $n$) such that on any input $x$ of length $n$, $V$ makes at most $K$ queries to $\\pi$.

We can equivalently consider all $a\\in\\{0,1\\}^{K}$ by padding shorter transcripts.
