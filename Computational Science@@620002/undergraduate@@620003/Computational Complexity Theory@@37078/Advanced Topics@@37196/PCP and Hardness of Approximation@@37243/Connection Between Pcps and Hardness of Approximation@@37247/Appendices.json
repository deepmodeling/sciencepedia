This verifier is designed for decision problems on inputs of size $n$. Its operation is defined as follows:\n\n1.  The verifier uses a random string $R$ of total length $r(n)$. This string is a concatenation of two independent parts, $R_1$ and $R_2$, with lengths $r_1(n)$ and $r_2(n)$ respectively, so that $r(n) = r_1(n) + r_2(n)$.\n2.  The first part, $R_1$, is used to deterministically select a set of $q(n)$ distinct locations to query within a given proof string $\\pi$. We denote the set of query locations generated from $R_1$ as $Q(R_1)$.\n3.  The second part, $R_2$, is used to deterministically select an acceptance predicate, denoted $V_{R_2}$. An acceptance predicate is a boolean function that takes $q(n)$ bits as input and returns a single bit indicating acceptance (1) or rejection (0).\n4.  For a given full random string $R = R_1R_2$, the verifier accepts the proof $\\pi$ if and only if the predicate $V_{R_2}$ evaluates to 1 on the specific bits of the proof read from the locations in $Q(R_1)$.\n\nIn the standard method to show hardness of approximation, this PCP system is converted into an instance of a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). A distinct constraint is generated for each unique pair $(Q, V)$, consisting of a query location set $Q$ and an acceptance predicate $V$, that the verifier can possibly produce from its random strings.\n\nAssuming that the mappings from random strings to outcomes are maximally diverse (i.e., different random strings produce different outcomes whenever possible), what is the maximum possible number of constraints that can be generated for the resulting CSP instance? Express your answer as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of $r_1(n)$, $r_2(n)$, and $q(n)$. For simplicity in the final expression, you may write these functions as $r_1, r_2$, and $q$.", "solution": "There are $2^{r_{1}}$ possible strings for $R_{1}$ and $2^{r_{2}}$ possible strings for $R_{2}$. Under the maximal diversity assumption, the mapping $R_{1} \\mapsto Q(R_{1})$ can be injective across all $2^{r_{1}}$ possibilities, yielding at most $2^{r_{1}}$ distinct query sets. For the acceptance predicate, the total number of distinct boolean predicates on $q$ bits is $2^{2^{q}}$, so the mapping $R_{2} \\mapsto V_{R_{2}}$ can produce at most $\\min\\!\\left(2^{r_{2}},\\,2^{2^{q}}\\right)$ distinct predicates.\n\nBecause $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ are independent and concatenated to form $R = R_{1}R_{2}$, every pair of outcomes combines, so the set of distinct verifier outcomes is the Cartesian product of the sets of distinct $Q$ and $V$. Hence, the maximum number of distinct pairs $(Q,V)$—and thus the maximum number of constraints generated—is\n$$\n2^{r_{1}} \\cdot \\min\\!\\left(2^{r_{2}},\\,2^{2^{q}}\\right).\n$$\nThis quantity is always at most $2^{r_{1}+r_{2}}$, the total number of random strings, as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2^{r_{1}}\\min\\!\\left(2^{r_{2}},\\,2^{2^{q}}\\right)}$$", "id": "1418606"}, {"introduction": "The magic of the PCP theorem lies in the \"gap\" it creates between the satisfaction level of YES instances and NO instances.
