A 3-SAT formula is a collection of $m$ clauses, where each clause is the logical OR of three literals (a variable or its negation). A claimed solution is an assignment of a boolean value (true/false) to each variable in the formula.\n\nThe verifier's protocol is as follows:\n1.  Select one of the $m$ clauses from the formula uniformly at random.\n2.  Read the assigned boolean values for the three variables appearing in the selected clause from the claimed solution.\n3.  If this assignment of values makes the clause true, the verifier outputs 'ACCEPT'. Otherwise, it outputs 'REJECT'.\n\nNow, consider a specific, large, and *unsatisfiable* 3-SAT formula. Since the formula is unsatisfiable, any claimed satisfying assignment must be false. An adversary provides a cleverly crafted assignment that, while not satisfying the whole formula, maximizes the number of satisfied clauses. For this particular formula, it is known that the maximum fraction of clauses that can be simultaneously satisfied by any single assignment is exactly $\\frac{7}{8}$.\n\nIf the verifier applies its spot-check protocol to this \"best possible\" but ultimately incorrect assignment, what is the probability that the verifier will be fooled and output 'ACCEPT'?
