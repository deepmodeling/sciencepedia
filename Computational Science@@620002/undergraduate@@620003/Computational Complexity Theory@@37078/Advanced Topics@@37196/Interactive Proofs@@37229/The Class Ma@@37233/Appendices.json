The key is to understand the definitions of the complexity classes MA and co-MA.\n\nAn MA protocol consists of a prover (Merlin) sending a proof to a probabilistic polynomial-time verifier (Arthur). The verifier's decision determines membership in the language.\n\nStep 1: Analyze Merlin's objective in System 1 (MA protocol).\nThe definition of the class MA (Merlin-Arthur) for a language $L$ is as follows:\n- **Completeness:** If an instance $x$ is in $L$ ($x \\in L$), there must exist a proof $y$ that Merlin can send such that Arthur accepts with high probability (e.g., $\\ge 2/3$).\n- **Soundness:** If an instance $x$ is not in $L$ ($x \\notin L$), for any proof $y$ that Merlin sends, Arthur must accept with low probability (e.g., $\\le 1/3$).\n\nIn this framework, Merlin's objective is always to make Arthur accept. Acceptance by Arthur is interpreted as a \"yes\" answer for the membership of the instance in the language.\nFor System 1, the protocol is for the language $L_{SI}$. Merlin wants to convince Arthur that the instance $(H, C)$ is in $L_{SI}$. As stated in the problem, $(H, C) \\in L_{SI}$ is equivalent to the statement \"$H$ has a Hamiltonian cycle\".\nTherefore, in System 1, Merlin's goal is to provide a proof that helps convince Arthur that $H$ does have a Hamiltonian cycle.\n\nStep 2: Analyze Merlin's objective in System 2 (co-MA protocol).\nThe class co-MA is the class of languages whose complements are in MA. That is, $L \\in \\text{co-MA}$ if and only if $\\bar{L} \\in \\text{MA}$.\nA co-MA protocol for a language $L$ is, by definition, an MA protocol for its complement, $\\bar{L}$.\n\nFor System 2, the protocol is a co-MA protocol for $L_{SI}$. This means it is an MA protocol for the language $\\bar{L}_{SI}$. The language $\\bar{L}_{SI}$ consists of all pairs of graphs $(G_1, G_2)$ where $G_2$ is *not* isomorphic to a subgraph of $G_1$.\nIn this MA protocol for $\\bar{L}_{SI}$, Merlin's objective is still to make Arthur accept. However, Arthur's acceptance now signifies that the instance is in $\\bar{L}_{SI}$.\nSo, Merlin wants to convince Arthur that the instance $(H, C)$ is in $\\bar{L}_{SI}$. The statement $(H, C) \\in \\bar{L}_{SI}$ is equivalent to \"$H$ does not have a Hamiltonian cycle\".\nTherefore, in System 2, Merlin's goal is to provide a proof that helps convince Arthur that $H$ does NOT have a Hamiltonian cycle.\n\nStep 3: Combine the results and select the correct option.\nFrom Step 1, in System 1 (MA), Merlin aims to prove that $H$ has a Hamiltonian cycle.\nFrom Step 2, in System 2 (co-MA), Merlin aims to prove that $H$ does NOT have a Hamiltonian cycle.\n\nLet's check the given options:\nA.
