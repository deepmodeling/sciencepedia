By computing the size of the largest fooling set and the rank of the matrix for the function $f(x,y) = x+y$, you will gain a practical feel for these fundamental tools and how they capture a function's communication complexity.", "problem": "In the field of communication complexity, we study the amount of communication required for two separated parties, say Alice and Bob, to jointly compute a function $f(x,y)$, where Alice only knows input $x$ and Bob only knows input $y$. The properties of the function's communication matrix and associated combinatorial structures like fooling sets are fundamental to establishing lower bounds on this communication cost.\n\nConsider a function $f: X \\times Y \\to Z$ where Alice is given an input $x \\in X$ and Bob is given an input $y \\in Y$.\nFor this problem, let the input sets be $X = Y = \\{0, 1, 2\\}$, and the function be the simple addition operator, $f(x, y) = x+y$.\n\nThe **communication matrix** $M_f$ for a function $f$ is a matrix where the rows are indexed by Alice's inputs $x \\in X$ and the columns are indexed by Bob's inputs $y \\in Y$. The entry at row $x$ and column $y$ is given by the function's value, $f(x,y)$.\n\nA **fooling set** is a set of input pairs $S = \\{(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \\dots, (x_k, y_k)\\}$ that satisfy two specific conditions:\n1.  **Monochromaticity**: All pairs in the set must evaluate to the same output value.

That is, $f(x_i, y_j) \\neq z_0$ or $f(x_j, y_i) \\neq z_0$.\n\nFor the function $f(x,y)=x+y$ defined above, determine two values: the size of the largest possible fooling set, and the rank of the communication matrix $M_f$ over the field of real numbers.\n\nProvide your answer as an ordered pair of integers $(s, r)$, where $s$ is the size of the largest fooling set and $r$ is the rank of the matrix.", "solution": "We are given $X = Y = \\{0,1,2\\}$ and $f(x,y) = x+y$. The communication matrix $M_{f}$ has entries $M_{f}[x,y] = x+y$. Writing rows in the order $x=0,1,2$ and columns in the order $y=0,1,2$, we obtain\n$$\nM_{f} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n2 & 3 & 4\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n\nFirst, we determine the size $s$ of the largest fooling set. By the monochromaticity condition, a fooling set must lie within a level set of $f$, i.e., a set of pairs satisfying $x+y = z_{0}$ for some fixed $z_{0}$. Over $X \\times Y = \\{0,1,2\\}^{2}$, the possible sums are $z_{0} \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$. The corresponding level sets have sizes:\n- $z_{0}=0$: $\\{(0,0)\\}$, size $1$;\n- $z_{0}=1$: $\\{(0,1),(1,0)\\}$, size $2$;\n- $z_{0}=2$: $\\{(0,2),(1,1),(2,0)\\}$, size $3$;\n- $z_{0}=3$: $\\{(1,2),(2,1)\\}$, size $2$;\n- $z_{0}=4$: $\\{(2,2)\\}$, size $1$.\n\nThus any monochromatic set has size at most $3$, hence $s \\leq 3$. We now exhibit a fooling set of size $3$ to show that this bound is tight. Take\n$$\nS = \\{(0,2), (1,1), (2,0)\\},\n$$\nfor which $f(x,y)=2$ for all $(x,y)\\in S$. For the fooling condition, consider any two distinct elements and check the crossed pairs:\n- For $(0,2)$ and $(1,1)$, the crossed values are $f(0,1)=1 \\neq 2$ and $f(1,2)=3 \\neq 2$.\n- For $(0,2)$ and $(2,0)$, the crossed values are $f(0,0)=0 \\neq 2$ and $f(2,2)=4 \\neq 2$.\n- For $(1,1)$ and $(2,0)$, the crossed values are $f(1,0)=1 \\neq 2$ and $f(2,1)=3 \\neq 2$.\nIn each case at least one crossed value is not equal to $2$ (indeed both differ), so $S$ is a valid fooling set. Therefore the largest fooling set has size $s=3$.\n\nNext, we determine the rank $r$ of $M_{f}$ over the reals. Observe that for $a = \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\1\\\\2\\end{pmatrix}$, $b = \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\1\\\\2\\end{pmatrix}$, and $1 = \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\1\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}$, we can write\n$$\nM_{f} = a 1^{T} + 1 b^{T},\n$$\nsince $(a 1^{T})_{xy} = x$ and $(1 b^{T})_{xy} = y$, so their sum is $x+y$. Each summand has rank $1$, hence $\\operatorname{rank}(M_{f}) \\leq 2$. To see that the rank is exactly $2$, note that the first two rows, $\\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 & 2\\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3\\end{pmatrix}$, are linearly independent over $\\mathbb{R}$.
