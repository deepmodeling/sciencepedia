It states that \"for every vertex $x$, there is an edge from $x$ to $c$, AND for every vertex $y$, there is an edge from $c$ to $y$.\" This means that every vertex in the graph has an edge pointing to $c$, and $c$ has an edge pointing to every vertex in the graph.

Conjoining with $E(z,y)$ appends one more edge, yielding a path from $x$ to $y$ of length between $2$ and $i+1$. Disjoining with $E(x,y)$ includes paths of length $1$.

Because the quantification ranges over all ordered pairs with $x \\neq y$, this condition enforces mutual reachability for every pair of distinct vertices: for any $u \\neq v$, both $TC(u,v)$ and $TC(v,u)$ must hold. This is precisely the standard definition of strong connectivity in directed graphs: for all vertices $u,v$, there exists a directed path from $u$ to $v$. The clause $(x \\neq y)$ merely avoids imposing any condition on $x=y$, which is immaterial since strong connectivity does not require nontrivial self-reachability; allowing trivial paths of length $0$ for $x=y$ is standard and does not affect the property.\n\nWe compare with the options:\n- A (single simple cycle) is sufficient but not necessary for the sentence to hold, so it is too restrictive.\n- B (strongly connected) matches exactly the interpretation of $\\Psi$.\n- C (DAG) cannot satisfy $\\Psi$ except in trivial cases, so it is generally incompatible.\n- D (at least one edge) is far too weak.\n- E (complete graph) is strictly stronger than needed, requiring edges between all distinct pairs rather than merely reachability.\n\nTherefore, the property defined by $\\Psi$ is that the graph is strongly connected, corresponding to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1427703"}]}
