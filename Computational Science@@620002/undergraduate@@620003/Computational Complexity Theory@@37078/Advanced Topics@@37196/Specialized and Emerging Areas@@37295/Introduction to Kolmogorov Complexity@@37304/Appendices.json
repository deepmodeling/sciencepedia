For a finite binary string $x$, its Kolmogorov complexity, denoted $K(x)$, is defined with respect to a fixed universal Turing Machine, $U$. It is the length (in bits) of the shortest program $p$ that, when provided as input to $U$, causes $U$ to output the string $x$ and then halt. Formally, $K(x) = \\min\\{|p| : U(p)=x\\}$. While the exact value of $K(x)$ depends on the chosen universal machine $U$, key relationships in complexity theory, such as upper and lower bounds, hold up to an additive constant.\n\nConsider a data processing task where a binary string $x$ is concatenated with itself to form a new string $xx$.

Fix a program $r_{f}$ of constant length $|r_{f}|=c_{f}$ that, given a description of some program $p$, simulates $U(p)$ to obtain $x$, then computes and outputs $f(x)$. Consider the concatenated code $r_{f}p$ (well-formed because we use prefix-free descriptions), which has length $|r_{f}p| = |r_{f}| + |p| = c_{f} + K(x)$ and causes $U$ to output $f(x)$. Therefore\n$$\nK(f(x)) \\leq |r_{f}p| = K(x) + c_{f}.\n$$\n\nApply this with $f(y)=yy$ (duplicate the string).
