A common family of algorithms for PIT involves evaluating the polynomial at a set of test points. If all evaluations result in zero, the algorithm concludes that the polynomial is the zero polynomial. However, if the set of test points is too small or not chosen carefully, such an algorithm can be \"fooled\".\n\nConsider a simple randomized PIT algorithm that tests a two-variable polynomial $P(x,y)$ by evaluating it at all points in the set $S = \\{(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)\\}$.
