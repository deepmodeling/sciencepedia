The validation of the problem statement finds it to be scientifically sound, well-posed, and containing all necessary information for a unique solution. It is a standard problem in the field of numerical analysis. We shall first address the theoretical aspect concerning the identity of the interpolating polynomial, followed by the computational procedure for experimental verification.\n\nA fundamental theorem in approximation theory states that for any set of $N+1$ distinct points $\\{x_k\\}_{k=0}^N$ and corresponding values $\\{y_k\\}_{k=0}^N$, there exists a unique polynomial $p_N(x)$ of degree at most $N$ such that $p_N(x_k)=y_k$ for all $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N\\}$. The problem asks what this interpolant $p_N(x)$ becomes when the function $f(x)$ being interpolated is itself a polynomial. Let the degree of $f(x)$ be $M$. We analyze two cases.\n\nCase 1: $M \\le N$.\nLet the function to be interpolated, $f(x)$, be a polynomial of degree $M$, where $M \\le N$. The space of polynomials of degree at most $M$, denoted $P_M$, is a subspace of the space of polynomials of degree at most $N$, $P_N$. Thus, $f(x) \\in P_N$.\n\nThe Chebyshev interpolant, $p_N(x)$, is defined as the unique polynomial in $P_N$ that satisfies the interpolation conditions $p_N(x_k) = f(x_k)$ for the $N+1$ distinct Chebyshev nodes $\\{x_k\\}_{k=0}^N$.\n\nConsider the difference polynomial $q(x) = p_N(x) - f(x)$. Since both $p_N(x)$ and $f(x)$ are polynomials of degree at most $N$, their difference $q(x)$ must also be a polynomial of degree at most $N$.\nBy the definition of interpolation, at each node $x_k$, we have:\n$$q(x_k) = p_N(x_k) - f(x_k) = f(x_k) - f(x_k) = 0$$\nThis shows that $q(x)$ has $N+1$ distinct roots. A non-zero polynomial of degree at most $N$ can have at most $N$ distinct roots. Therefore, for $q(x)$ to have $N+1$ roots, it must be the zero polynomial, i.e., $q(x) \\equiv 0$.\n\nFrom $q(x) = 0$, it follows that $p_N(x) \\equiv f(x)$ for all $x$. The interpolating polynomial is identical to the original function itself. Consequently, the interpolation error, $E = \\max |p_N(x) - f(x)|$, must be identically zero. In practice, due to floating-point arithmetic in a computational environment, this error will be a very small number on the order of machine epsilon. This theoretical result applies to Test cases $1$, $2$, $3$, and $4$, where $M \\le N$.\n\nCase 2: $M > N$.\nIf $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $M > N$, it generally cannot be represented exactly by a polynomial $p_N(x)$ of degree at most $N$. The interpolation error, $f(x) - p_N(x)$, is given by the formula:\n$$f(x) - p_N(x) = \\frac{f^{(N+1)}(\\xi)}{(N+1)!} \\prod_{k=0}^{N} (x-x_k)$$\nfor some $\\xi$ in the interval $[a,b]$. Since $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $M > N$, its $(N+1)$-th derivative, $f^{(N+1)}(x)$, is a non-zero polynomial of degree $M - (N+1) \\ge 0$. Thus, the error term is not identically zero. The product $\\prod_{k=0}^{N} (x-x_k)$ is a specific polynomial of degree $N+1$ with roots at the Chebyshev nodes. The choice of Chebyshev nodes minimizes the maximum value of this product term over the interval, thus providing a near-optimal polynomial approximation. For this case, we expect a non-negligible error $E > 0$ that is significantly larger than machine precision. This applies to Test case $5$.\n\nThe computational procedure to verify these findings for each test case is as follows:\n1. For each test case defined by the interval $[a,b]$, the polynomial degree for interpolation $N$, and the coefficients $\\{c_m\\}_{m=0}^{M}$ of the function $f(x) = \\sum_{m=0}^{M} c_m x^m$, we first define the function $f(x)$ for computational evaluation.\n2. The $N+1$ Chebyshev nodes $\\{x_k\\}_{k=0}^N$ are computed on the interval $[a,b]$ using the given formula:\n   $$x_k = \\frac{a+b}{2} + \\frac{b-a}{2} \\cos\\!\\left(\\frac{(2k+1)\\pi}{2(N+1)}\\right)$$\n3. The values of the function $f(x)$ are evaluated at these nodes to obtain the set of points $\\{ (x_k, f(x_k)) \\}_{k=0}^N$.\n4. The interpolating polynomial $p_N(x)$ is constructed. While one could solve a linear system for its coefficients, a more numerically stable and efficient method for evaluation is to use the barycentric interpolation formula. We will use a library function that implements this method.\n5. A dense, uniform grid of $2001$ points is created over the interval $[a,b]$, including the endpoints.\n6. Both the original function $f(x)$ and the interpolating polynomial $p_N(x)$ are evaluated at each point on this dense grid.\n7. The maximum absolute difference between the evaluated function values and the interpolant values across the grid is computed to find the error $E$:\n   $$E = \\max_{x \\in \\text{grid}} \\left|p_N(x) - f(x)\\right|$$\nThis process is repeated for all $5$ test cases. The resulting errors will either be near-zero (for $M \\le N$) or significantly larger (for $M > N$), thereby confirming the theoretical analysis.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.interpolate import barycentric_interpolate\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the Chebyshev interpolation problem for a suite of test cases.\n    For each case, it computes the maximum interpolation error on a dense grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each tuple contains: (a, b, N, coefficients_c)\n    # where c are coefficients for powers from 0 to M.\n    test_cases = [\n        # Test 1: M < N\n        (-1.0, 1.0, 8, [3.0, -2.0, 0.0, 5.0]),\n        # Test 2: M = N\n        (2.0, 5.0, 5, [7.0, 0.0, -4.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]),\n        # Test 3: M < N, shifted/scaled interval\n        (-3.0, 4.0, 12, [1.0, -1.0, 1.0, 0.0, -1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]),\n        # Test 4: M = N, minimal degree\n        (-2.0, 3.0, 0, [2.5]),\n        # Test 5: M > N, contrast case\n        (0.0, 1.0, 6, [0.5, -1.2, 0.0, 0.3, 0.0, -0.7, 0.0, 0.4, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0])\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        a, b, N, coeffs = case\n\n        # 1.

It concerns the comparison of different node choices for interpolation, a fundamental topic in computational science. The function $f(x) = \\dfrac{1}{1+25x^2}$ is the canonical Runge function, used to demonstrate the potential divergence of high-degree polynomial interpolants. The use of Legendre and Chebyshev nodes are well-established techniques for mitigating this divergence, known as the Runge phenomenon. The problem is scientifically correct and relevant.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. For any set of $n$ distinct nodes, a unique interpolating polynomial of degree at most $n-1$ exists. The roots of the Legendre polynomial $P_n(x)$ and the specified Chebyshev nodes are known to be $n$ distinct real numbers within the interval $(-1, 1)$. The instructions for calculating the error are unambiguous.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and mathematical language. All quantities and procedures are formally defined.\n\nThe problem statement exhibits no flaws. It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, or ill-posed.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be furnished.\n\nThe task is to compare the efficacy of two sets of interpolation nodes—roots of Legendre polynomials and Chebyshev nodes of the first kind—for interpolating the Runge function $f(x) = \\dfrac{1}{1+25x^2}$ on the interval $[-1, 1]$. The comparison is based on the maximum absolute error between the function and its polynomial interpolant for various polynomial degrees $n$.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the theory of polynomial interpolation. Given $n$ distinct points $(x_j, y_j)$ for $j=0, \\dots, n-1$, there exists a unique polynomial $p_{n-1}(x)$ of degree at most $n-1$ such that $p_{n-1}(x_j) = y_j$ for all $j$. While this polynomial is unique, its quality as an approximation to an underlying function $f(x)$ (where $y_j = f(x_j)$) over the entire interval is highly dependent on the choice of the nodes $x_j$.\n\nA naive choice of equally spaced nodes can lead to disastrous results for high-degree interpolation, particularly for functions like the given $f(x)$. The error can grow without bound near the ends of the interval as $n \\to \\infty$, a pathology known as the Runge phenomenon.\n\nTo overcome this, one must use nodes that are distributed more densely near the endpoints of the interval. The roots of orthogonal polynomials are an excellent choice. This problem investigates two such sets:\n1.  **Legendre Nodes**: The roots of the Legendre polynomials $P_n(x)$, which are the orthogonal polynomials with respect to the weight function $w(x)=1$ on $[-1, 1]$. These are also the nodes for Gauss-Legendre quadrature, which is designed to achieve the highest possible accuracy for polynomial integration.\n2.  **Chebyshev Nodes**: The roots of the Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind, $T_n(x)$. These nodes are the projections onto the $x$-axis of equally spaced points on a semicircle. Interpolation at these nodes is proven to minimize the Lebesgue constant, which bounds the interpolation error, and is near-optimal in the minimax sense (minimizing the maximum error).\n\nFor the numerical construction and evaluation of the interpolating polynomial, we avoid the naive use of a Vandermonde matrix, which is notoriously ill-conditioned. Instead, we employ the barycentric interpolation formula, which is both computationally efficient and numerically stable. The interpolant is expressed as:\n$$\np_{n-1}(x) = \\frac{\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\frac{w_j}{x-x_j} y_j}{\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\frac{w_j}{x-x_j}}\n$$\nwhere $y_j = f(x_j)$ and the barycentric weights $w_j$ are given by $w_j = \\frac{1}{\\prod_{k \\neq j} (x_j - x_k)}$. These weights depend only on the nodes, not the function values, and can be pre-computed. The `scipy.interpolate.BarycentricInterpolator` class provides a robust implementation of this method.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Define the target function $f(x) = (1+25x^2)^{-1}$ and the high-resolution evaluation grid $G$ of $M=2001$ points on $[-1, 1]$.\n2.

Compute the $n$ roots of $P_n(x)$ using a standard numerical library function, such as `scipy.special.roots_legendre`.\n        ii. Evaluate $f(x)$ at these nodes to obtain the values $y_j$.\n        iii. Construct a barycentric interpolator using the nodes and function values.\n        iv.

Calculate the maximum absolute error $E_{\\text{Leg}} = \\max_{x \\in G} |f(x) - p_{n-1, \\text{Leg}}(x)|$.\n\n    b.  **Chebyshev Interpolation**:\n        i.  Compute the $n$ Chebyshev nodes using the formula $x_k = \\cos\\left( \\frac{(2k-1)\\pi}{2n} \\right)$ for $k=1, \\dots, n$.\n        ii. Evaluate $f(x)$ at these nodes.\n        iii.

Collect the pairs $[E_{\\text{Leg}}, E_{\\text{Cheb}}]$ for each $n$, round the values to $8$ decimal places, and format the final output as a single-line string according to the problem specification.\n\nFor the special case $n=1$, the single Legendre root is $x=0$ (since $P_1(x)=x$) and the single Chebyshev node is $x_1=\\cos(\\pi/2)=0$. Thus, both methods use the same node, resulting in the same constant interpolating polynomial $p_0(x) = f(0) = 1$. The error is $\\max_{x \\in [-1,1]} |(1+25x^2)^{-1} - 1| = |(1+25(1)^2)^{-1} - 1| = 25/26 \\approx 0.96153846$. This serves as a basic check of the procedure. For higher $n$, both methods are expected to show good convergence, with Chebyshev nodes generally yielding slightly lower maximum error due to their minimax properties.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import roots_legendre\nfrom scipy.interpolate import BarycentricInterpolator\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Constructs and compares polynomial interpolants for the Runge function\n    using Legendre and Chebyshev nodes, and computes the maximum absolute error.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the set of degrees to test\n    degrees = [1, 5, 10, 25]\n\n    # Define the high-resolution grid for error evaluation\n    M = 2001\n    grid_points = np.linspace(-1.0, 1.0, M)\n\n    def target_function(x):\n        \"\"\"The Runge function.\"\"\"\n        return 1.0 / (1.0 + 25.0 * x**2)\n\n    # Evaluate the function on the grid\n    f_on_grid = target_function(grid_points)\n\n    all_results = []\n\n    for n in degrees:\n        # --- Case (a): Legendre Polynomial Roots ---\n\n        # 1.
