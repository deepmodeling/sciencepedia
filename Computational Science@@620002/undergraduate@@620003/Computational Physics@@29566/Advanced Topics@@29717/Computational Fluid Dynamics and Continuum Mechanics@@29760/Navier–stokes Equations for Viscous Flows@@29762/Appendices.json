It is a well-posed problem in biophysical fluid dynamics, based on the fundamental principles of the Navier-Stokes equations. The biological context is scientifically accurate, and the provided physical parameters are realistic for fluid dynamics at the cellular scale. The problem is free of ambiguity, contradiction, and factual unsoundness.\n\nWe proceed to the solution. The motion of a viscous, incompressible Newtonian fluid is described by the Navier-Stokes equations. For a fluid with constant density $\\rho$ and dynamic viscosity $\\mu$, the equation for conservation of momentum is:\n$$ \\rho \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{v}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v} \\right) = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v} $$\nHere, $\\mathbf{v}$ is the fluid velocity vector, $p$ is the pressure, and $t$ is time. We have neglected body forces, as they are typically insignificant compared to viscous and pressure forces at this microscopic scale.\n\nThe term on the left, specifically the convective acceleration term $\\rho (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v}$, represents inertial effects. The term on the right, $\\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v}$, represents viscous effects due to friction within the fluid. To determine the character of the flow, we compare the characteristic magnitudes of these two terms. This is accomplished through scaling analysis.\n\nWe introduce the characteristic scales provided in the problem: velocity scale $U$ and length scale $L$. The differential operator $\\nabla$ can be scaled as $\\nabla \\sim 1/L$.\nThe magnitude of the inertial term is estimated as:\n$$ |\\rho (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v}| \\sim \\rho \\frac{U^2}{L} $$\nThe magnitude of the viscous term is estimated as:\n$$ |\\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v}| \\sim \\mu \\frac{U}{L^2} $$\nThe dimensionless group that quantifies the ratio of inertial to viscous effects is the ratio of these two magnitudes. This group is known as the Reynolds number, denoted $Re$.\n$$ Re = \\frac{\\text{Magnitude of inertial term}}{\\text{Magnitude of viscous term}} \\sim \\frac{\\rho U^2 / L}{\\mu U / L^2} = \\frac{\\rho U L}{\\mu} $$\nNow we must compute the numerical value of $Re$. First, we convert all given parameters to base SI units.\n- Characteristic length scale: $L = 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 50 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n- Characteristic flow speed: $U = 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m/s} = 50 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$.\n- Mass density: $\\rho = 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}$ (already in SI).\n- Dynamic viscosity: $\\mu = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s}$. The unit Pascal-second is an SI unit, equivalent to $\\mathrm{kg} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-1} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nWe substitute these values into the expression for the Reynolds number:\n$$ Re = \\frac{(10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}) \\times (50 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}) \\times (50 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m})}{10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s}} $$\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n$$ Re = \\frac{10^{3} \\times (50 \\times 50) \\times (10^{-6} \\times 10^{-6})}{10^{-3}} = \\frac{10^{3} \\times 2500 \\times 10^{-12}}{10^{-3}} $$\n$$ Re = \\frac{2.5 \\times 10^{3} \\times 10^{3} \\times 10^{-12}}{10^{-3}} = \\frac{2.5 \\times 10^{6} \\times 10^{-12}}{10^{-3}} = \\frac{2.5 \\times 10^{-6}}{10^{-3}} $$\n$$ Re = 2.5 \\times 10^{-6 - (-3)} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-3} $$\nThe numerical value is $Re = 0.0025$.\n\nAs requested, we interpret this result. The computed Reynolds number $Re = 2.5 \\times 10^{-3}$ is significantly smaller than $1$ ($Re \\ll 1$). Since the Reynolds number represents the ratio of inertial to viscous forces, this result indicates that viscous forces are overwhelmingly dominant over inertial forces. The flow in the Kupffer’s vesicle is therefore viscosity-dominated. This flow regime is known as Stokes flow or creeping flow. Such flows are characterized by being laminar, orderly, and time-reversible (in the absence of diffusion), with negligible momentum advection. This is the expected physical regime for most biological processes at the cellular and sub-cellular level.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.5 \\times 10^{-3}}$$", "id": "2654181"}, {"introduction": "In incompressible flows, pressure plays a unique role not as a thermodynamic state variable, but as a constraint field that enforces the divergence-free condition on velocity.

It requires the derivation of the pressure Poisson equation from the fundamental Navier-Stokes equations for a steady, incompressible viscous flow, followed by the implementation of a spectral method to solve for the pressure field and evaluate a residual acceleration. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions. I will therefore proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe first task is to derive the Poisson equation for pressure $p(x,y)$. We begin with the steady, incompressible momentum equation in the absence of body forces:\n$$(\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{u} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity field, $p$ is the pressure, $\\rho$ is the constant density, and $\\nu$ is the constant kinematic viscosity. To isolate the pressure term, we take the divergence of this equation:\n$$\\nabla \\cdot ((\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{u}) = \\nabla \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\nabla p\\right) + \\nabla \\cdot (\\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u})$$\nGiven that $\\rho$ and $\\nu$ are constants, they can be moved outside the divergence operator. The divergence of a gradient is the Laplacian, so $\\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla p) = \\nabla^2 p$. This gives:\n$$\\nabla \\cdot ((\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{u}) = -\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\nabla^2 p + \\nu \\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u})$$\nThe problem states to use the identity $\\nabla\\cdot(\\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}) = \\nabla^2 (\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u})$. The flow is incompressible, which is expressed by the constraint $\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u} = 0$. Applying this, the viscous term's divergence vanishes:\n$$\\nu \\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}) = \\nu \\nabla^2 (\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u}) = \\nu \\nabla^2(0) = 0$$\nThe equation thus simplifies to:\n$$\\nabla \\cdot ((\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{u}) = -\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\nabla^2 p$$\nRearranging for the Laplacian of pressure yields the desired Poisson equation for pressure:\n$$\\nabla^2 p = -\\rho \\nabla \\cdot ((\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{u})$$\nThis equation dictates that the pressure field adjusts to counteract the divergence of the advective acceleration, ensuring the flow remains incompressible at all times.\n\nThe second task is to solve this equation numerically on a periodic square domain of side length $L$ using a spectral method based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The domain is discretized into a uniform $N \\times N$ grid. The key principle of a spectral method is that differentiation in physical space corresponds to multiplication in Fourier space. If $\\hat{g}(k_x, k_y)$ is the 2D discrete Fourier transform of a function $g(x,y)$, then the Fourier transform of its partial derivative with respect to $x$ is given by $i k_x \\hat{g}(k_x, k_y)$, where $k_x$ is the wavenumber in the $x$-direction.\n\nApplying the Fourier transform, denoted by $\\mathcal{F}$, to the pressure Poisson equation yields:\n$$\\mathcal{F}\\{\\nabla^2 p\\} = \\mathcal{F}\\{-\\rho \\nabla \\cdot ((\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{u})\\}$$\nThe Fourier transform of the Laplacian operator $\\nabla^2 = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}$ is multiplication by $-(k_x^2 + k_y^2)$. Let $S(x,y) = -\\rho \\nabla \\cdot ((\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{u})$ be the source term. The equation in Fourier space becomes:\n$$-(k_x^2 + k_y^2) \\hat{p}(k_x, k_y) = \\hat{S}(k_x, k_y)$$\nThe Fourier coefficients of the pressure field, $\\hat{p}$, can be found by algebraic division:\n$$\\hat{p}(k_x, k_y) = -\\frac{\\hat{S}(k_x, k_y)}{k_x^2 + k_y^2}$$\nA singularity exists at the zero-wavenumber mode $(k_x, k_y) = (0,0)$, where the denominator is zero. This reflects the physical fact that pressure is determined only up to an arbitrary additive constant. The problem specifies the \"zero-mean gauge,\" which is enforced by setting the zero-wavenumber Fourier coefficient of pressure to zero: $\\hat{p}(0,0) = 0$. For this to be consistent, the source term's zero-wavenumber mode, $\\hat{S}(0,0)$, must also be zero. This is guaranteed because $S$ is the divergence of a vector field, and the integral of a divergence over a periodic domain is zero.\n\nThe numerical implementation proceeds as follows:\n1. Define the $N \\times N$ spatial grid $(x_i, y_j)$ and the corresponding wavenumber grids $(K_x, K_y)$ using `numpy.fft.fftfreq`.\n2. Construct the velocity field components $u_x$ and $u_y$ on the spatial grid.\n3. Compute the advection term components, $A_x = (\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla)u_x$ and $A_y = (\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla)u_y$. The required spatial derivatives (e.g., $\\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x}$) are computed spectrally by FFT, multiplication by $i K_x$, and inverse FFT.\n4. Calculate the Poisson source term $S = -\\rho(\\frac{\\partial A_x}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial A_y}{\\partial y})$, again using spectral differentiation.\n5. Compute $\\hat{S}$ via a 2D FFT.\n6. Solve for $\\hat{p}$ in Fourier space, handling the $k=0$ mode as described.\n7. Compute the pressure field $p(x,y)$ by applying a 2D inverse FFT to $\\hat{p}$. The maximum absolute pressure $p_{\\max}$ is then found from this grid.\n\nFinally, we must compute the root-mean-square residual acceleration, $a_{\\mathrm{rms}}$. The residual acceleration field is defined as:\n$$\\mathbf{a}_{\\mathrm{res}}(x,y) = -\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\nabla p(x,y) + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}(x,y) - (\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{u}(x,y)$$\nThis residual represents the forcing per unit mass required to make the given velocity field an exact solution of the steady Navier-Stokes equations with the computed pressure field. All terms are computed on the grid. The gradient $\\nabla p$ and Laplacian $\\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$ are computed spectrally for consistency. The advection term $(\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{u}$ has already been computed.\nThe root-mean-square magnitude is given by:\n$$a_{\\mathrm{rms}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N^2}\\sum_{i,j=0}^{N-1} \\| \\mathbf{a}_{\\mathrm{res}}(x_i, y_j) \\|^2}$$\nwhere the sum is over all grid points. For the specific velocity field given, analytical investigation reveals that the advection term $(\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{u}$ is curl-free, meaning it can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar potential. The pressure field $p$ computed via the Poisson equation is precisely the one that makes $-\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\nabla p$ balance $(\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{u}$. Consequently, the first and third terms in the residual definition cancel, and the residual simplifies to $\\mathbf{a}_{\\mathrm{res}} = \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$. This implies that for the inviscid case ($\\nu=0$), the residual acceleration should be zero. The numerical implementation will compute the full residual expression to remain general and robust.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the pressure Poisson equation for a given 2D periodic flow\n    and computes the residual of the Navier-Stokes equations.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Global parameters\n    L = 1.0  # meters\n    N = 128  # grid size\n    rho = 1.0  # kg/m^3\n\n    # Test cases from the problem statement\n    test_cases = [\n        # (U, nu, (mx, my))\n        (1.0, 0.05, (1, 1)),  # Case 1\n        (1.0, 0.0, (2, 1)),   # Case 2\n        (0.5, 0.1, (3, 2)),   # Case 3\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n\n    # Discretization\n    delta = L / N\n    x = np.arange(N) * delta\n    y = np.arange(N) * delta\n    X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y, indexing='ij')\n\n    # Wavenumbers\n    k_freq = np.fft.fftfreq(N, d=delta)\n    Kx_1d = 2 * np.pi * k_freq\n    Ky_1d = 2 * np.pi * k_freq\n    Kx, Ky = np.meshgrid(Kx_1d, Ky_1d, indexing='ij')\n\n    # Laplacian operator in Fourier space\n    lap_fourier = -(Kx**2 + Ky**2)\n\n    for U, nu, (mx, my) in test_cases:\n        # Case-specific parameters\n        kx = 2 * np.pi * mx / L\n        ky = 2 * np.pi * my / L\n\n        # 1.

You may use a first-order exponential time differencing scheme with the linear operator applied exactly in Fourier space.\n- Initialize the vorticity $\\omega(\\mathbf{x},0)$ as a zero-mean, small-amplitude random field (dimensionless vorticity amplitude), and evolve up to a specified final time $T$ (in seconds) with time step $\\Delta t$ (in seconds).\n- At the end of each simulation, estimate the dominant wavelength by computing the angle-averaged radial spectrum of the vorticity field in Fourier space. Let the fundamental wavenumber be $k_0 = 2\\pi/L$. For integer $m \\ge 1$, define discrete wavenumbers $k_m = m k_0$ and bin the spectral energy by $k_m \\pm k_0/2$. Select the $m$ with the largest binned energy (excluding $m=0$) and report the dominant wavelength $\\lambda = 2\\pi / k_m$ in meters.\n- If the flow is linearly stable at all resolved nonzero wavenumbers, there is no pattern to report. To avoid unnecessary simulation in such a case, first determine whether any resolved discrete $k_m$ has a positive linear growth rate when the nonlinearity is neglected. The linear growth rate is obtained by substituting a Fourier mode into the linearized equation. If no $k_m$ with $m \\ge 1$ is linearly unstable, return $\\lambda = 0.0$ for that case without performing the time integration.\n- Express the final reported wavelength for each test case in meters, rounded to three decimal places.\n\nYour program must implement the above and then run the following test suite. Each test case is a tuple $\\left(L,\\alpha,\\beta,N,T,\\Delta t\\right)$, where $L$ is the domain side length in meters, $\\alpha$ is in $\\mathrm{m^2/s}$, $\\beta$ is in $\\mathrm{m^4/s}$, $N$ is the number of grid points per side (dimensionless), $T$ is the final time in seconds, and $\\Delta t$ is the time step in seconds:\n\n- Test $1$: $\\left(2\\pi,\\,1.0,\\,0.1,\\,64,\\,0.8,\\,0.01\\right)$.\n- Test $2$: $\\left(2\\pi,\\,0.05,\\,0.1,\\,64,\\,0.8,\\,0.01\\right)$.\n- Test $3$: $\\left(4\\pi,\\,1.0,\\,0.1,\\,64,\\,0.8,\\,0.01\\right)$.\n- Test $4$: $\\left(2\\pi,\\,1.0,\\,0.5,\\,64,\\,3.0,\\,0.01\\right)$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list of the four wavelengths, rounded to three decimal places, enclosed in square brackets, for example, $\\left[\\lambda_1,\\lambda_2,\\lambda_3,\\lambda_4\\right]$.\n\nAll answers must be in meters. Angles, if any, must be in radians. Percentages, if any, must be expressed as decimals.\n\nThe final output must be a single line. No other text should be printed.", "solution": "The problem statement poses a valid and well-defined task in computational physics. It asks for the numerical solution of a two-dimensional generalized Navier-Stokes equation in vorticity form, a model frequently used to study pattern formation in active fluids. The problem is scientifically grounded, mathematically specified, and all parameters for the simulation and analysis are provided. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or unsound premises. We shall therefore proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe governing equation for the scalar vorticity field $\\omega(\\mathbf{x},t)$ on a two-dimensional periodic domain of side length $L$ is\n$$\n\\partial_t \\omega + J(\\psi,\\omega) = -\\alpha \\nabla^2 \\omega - \\beta \\nabla^4 \\omega,\n$$\nwhere $\\psi$ is the streamfunction defined by the Poisson equation $-\\nabla^2 \\psi = \\omega$. The parameter $\\alpha > 0$ corresponds to an effective negative viscosity, injecting energy at long wavelengths, while $\\beta > 0$ provides a hyperviscous damping that stabilizes short wavelengths. The term $J(\\psi,\\omega) = \\partial_x \\psi \\, \\partial_y \\omega - \\partial_y \\psi \\, \\partial_x \\omega$ represents the nonlinear advection of vorticity.\n\nWe solve this equation using a pseudo-spectral method on a uniform grid of $N \\times N$ points. This method is exceptionally suited for problems with periodic boundary conditions, as it allows for the use of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to compute spatial derivatives with high accuracy. In Fourier space, the spatial derivatives become simple multiplications. A field $f(\\mathbf{x})$ and its Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(\\mathbf{k})$ are related by $\\hat{f}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\mathcal{F}\\{f(\\mathbf{x})\\}$. The transform of a partial derivative is $\\mathcal{F}\\{\\partial_x f\\} = i k_x \\hat{f}(\\mathbf{k})$, and the Laplacian becomes $\\mathcal{F}\\{\\nabla^2 f\\} = -(k_x^2+k_y^2)\\hat{f}(\\mathbf{k}) = -k^2 \\hat{f}(\\mathbf{k})$, where $\\mathbf{k}=(k_x, k_y)$ is the wavevector.\n\nThe governing equation in Fourier space is thus transformed into a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for each Fourier mode $\\hat{\\omega}(\\mathbf{k}, t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\hat{\\omega}_{\\mathbf{k}}}{dt} = (\\alpha k^2 - \\beta k^4)\\hat{\\omega}_{\\mathbf{k}} - \\widehat{J(\\psi,\\omega)}_{\\mathbf{k}}.\n$$\nThis equation is of the form $\\frac{d\\hat{\\omega}}{dt} = \\mathcal{L}\\hat{\\omega} + \\mathcal{N}(\\hat{\\omega})$, where $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathbf{k}} = \\alpha k^2 - \\beta k^4$ is the linear part and $\\mathcal{N}_{\\mathbf{k}} = -\\widehat{J(\\psi,\\omega)}_{\\mathbf{k}}$ is the nonlinear part.\n\nBefore simulation, a linear stability analysis is required. The growth rate of a mode with wavenumber $k=|\\mathbf{k}|$ is given by the linear operator, $\\sigma(k) = \\alpha k^2 - \\beta k^4$. A pattern can emerge only if there exists at least one unstable mode, i.e., $\\sigma(k) > 0$ for some $k \\neq 0$. This condition is met if $\\alpha k^2 > \\beta k^4$, which simplifies to $k^2 < \\alpha/\\beta$. The smallest non-zero wavenumber magnitude on the discrete grid is $k_{\\min} = 2\\pi/L$. Thus, a necessary condition for instability is $k_{\\min}^2 < \\alpha/\\beta$. If this condition is not met, all resolved modes are linearly stable, and no pattern will form from small initial noise. In such cases, the dominant wavelength $\\lambda$ is reported as $0.0$ without simulation.\n\nFor time integration, a first-order exponential time differencing (ETD1) scheme is employed. The linear part is treated exactly, and the nonlinear part is approximated as constant over a single time step $\\Delta t$. The update rule for a Fourier mode $\\hat{\\omega}_n = \\hat{\\omega}(t_n)$ to $\\hat{\\omega}_{n+1} = \\hat{\\omega}(t_{n+1})$ is\n$$\n\\hat{\\omega}_{n+1} = e^{\\mathcal{L} \\Delta t} \\hat{\\omega}_n + \\left(\\frac{e^{\\mathcal{L} \\Delta t} - 1}{\\mathcal{L}}\\right) \\mathcal{N}(\\hat{\\omega}_n),\n$$\nwhere the term in parentheses approaches $\\Delta t$ as $\\mathcal{L} \\to 0$, which is the case for the $k=0$ mode.\n\nThe nonlinear term $\\mathcal{N}(\\hat{\\omega})$ is computed pseudo-spectrally. At each time step:\n1.  The streamfunction $\\hat{\\psi}$ is found from $\\hat{\\omega}$ via the Fourier-space relation $k^2 \\hat{\\psi} = \\hat{\\omega}$, which gives $\\hat{\\psi}_{\\mathbf{k}} = \\hat{\\omega}_{\\mathbf{k}} / k^2$ for $\\mathbf{k} \\neq 0$ and $\\hat{\\psi}_{\\mathbf{k}=0} = 0$.\n2.  To prevent aliasing errors from the quadratic nonlinearity in the Jacobian, the standard two-thirds de-aliasing rule is applied. This involves filtering the Fourier-space representations of $\\hat{\\omega}$ and $\\hat{\\psi}$ by setting to zero all modes for which the integer wave index in either direction exceeds $N/3$.\n3.  The necessary spatial derivatives ($\\partial_x\\psi, \\partial_y\\psi, \\partial_x\\omega, \\partial_y\\omega$) are computed in Fourier space (e.g., $i k_x \\hat{\\psi}$).\n4.  These derivative fields are transformed back to physical space using inverse FFT.\n5.  The Jacobian $J(\\psi,\\omega)$ is computed by point-wise multiplication in physical space.\n6.  The result is transformed back to Fourier space to obtain $\\widehat{J(\\psi,\\omega)}$, which gives $\\mathcal{N}(\\hat{\\omega})$.\n\nThe simulation starts with a small-amplitude, zero-mean random vorticity field and evolves until a final time $T$.\n\nFinally, to determine the dominant wavelength, the angle-averaged power spectrum of the final vorticity field is computed. The magnitude of the wavevector for each point on the Fourier grid is calculated as $k = \\sqrt{k_x^2 + k_y^2}$. The energy $|\\hat{\\omega}(\\mathbf{k},T)|^2$ is binned according to the integer $m = \\text{round}(k/k_0)$, where $k_0 = 2\\pi/L$ is the fundamental wavenumber. The index $m^*$ corresponding to the bin with the maximum energy (for $m \\ge 1$) is identified. The dominant wavelength is then $\\lambda = 2\\pi/k_{m^*} = 2\\pi/(m^* k_0) = L/m^*$.\n\nThe implementation proceeds by first defining a function to execute a single simulation run for a given set of parameters $(L, \\alpha, \\beta, N, T, \\Delta t)$ and then applying this function to each of the specified test cases. The resulting wavelengths, rounded to three decimal places, are collected and presented in the required format.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef run_simulation(L, alpha, beta, N, T, dt, seed=42):\n    \"\"\"\n    Runs a single simulation for the 2D active fluid model.\n\n    Args:\n        L (float): Domain side length in meters.\n        alpha (float): Negative viscosity coefficient in m^2/s.\n        beta (float): Hyperviscosity coefficient in m^4/s.\n        N (int): Number of grid points per side.\n        T (float): Total simulation time in seconds.\n        dt (float): Time step in seconds.\n        seed (int): Seed for the random number generator for reproducibility.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The dominant wavelength in meters, or 0.0 if stable.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Linear stability pre-check.\n    # The system is unstable if there is any k > 0 such that sigma(k) > 0.\n    # sigma(k) = alpha*k^2 - beta*k^4.
