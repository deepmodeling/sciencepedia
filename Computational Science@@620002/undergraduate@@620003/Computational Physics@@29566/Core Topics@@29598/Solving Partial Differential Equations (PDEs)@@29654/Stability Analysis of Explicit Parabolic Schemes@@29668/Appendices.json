The question is well-posed and objective, requesting a specific quantity based on a standard analysis technique. The provided information is self-contained and sufficient for the application of von Neumann analysis, which by its nature considers an infinite spatial domain and thus does not require explicit boundary conditions for the stability of the interior scheme. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nTo perform the von Neumann analysis, we study the propagation of a generic error component, $\\epsilon_{j}^{n}$, which is the difference between the numerical solution and the exact solution at the grid point $(x_j, t^n)$. Since the finite difference scheme is linear, the error must satisfy the homogeneous form of the difference equation.

The conditions $a>0$, $c>0$, and $ac-b^{2}>0$ ensure the partial differential equation is parabolic, and the use of von Neumann analysis on a periodic domain is the standard procedure for determining the linear stability of the given finite difference scheme. We proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe stability of the explicit time-stepping scheme is determined by the amplification factor $G$ in a von Neumann stability analysis. We consider a single Fourier mode of the solution, represented as\n$$\nu_{i,j}^{n} = (G)^{n} \\exp\\left(I(k_x i \\Delta x + k_y j \\Delta y)\\right)\n$$\nwhere $G$ is the amplification factor for one time step $\\Delta t$, $I$ is the imaginary unit such that $I^2 = -1$, and $k_x$ and $k_y$ are the wavenumbers in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively.\n\nSubstituting this form into the finite difference scheme relates $u_{i,j}^{n+1} = G \\cdot u_{i,j}^{n}$ to the terms at time level $n$. The spatial shift operators act on the exponential term. For example, $u_{i+1,j}^{n} = u_{i,j}^{n} \\exp(I k_x \\Delta x)$.

The condition for linear stability of the forward Euler scheme is $|G| \\leq 1$, which translates to $-1 \\leq 1 - \\Delta t S(k_x, k_y) \\leq 1$.\n\nThe spatial operator is dissipative, meaning its discrete symbol is non-positive. This implies $S(k_x, k_y) \\ge 0$. This non-negativity is guaranteed by the ellipticity condition $ac-b^2 > 0$ and can be formally proven. Given that $\\Delta t > 0$, the upper bound $1 - \\Delta t S(k_x, k_y) \\leq 1$ is satisfied. The stability is therefore governed by the lower bound:\n$$\n-1 \\leq 1 - \\Delta t S(k_x, k_y) \\implies \\Delta t S(k_x, k_y) \\leq 2\n$$\nThis inequality must hold for all possible wavenumbers $k_x$ and $k_y$. To find the maximum allowable time step $\\Delta t_{\\max}$, we must enforce this condition for the worst case, where $S(k_x, k_y)$ is maximized:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{2}{\\max_{k_x, k_y} S(k_x, k_y)}\n$$\nWe must now find the maximum of $S(k_x, k_y)$.

To find the maximum, we must consider the case where the mixed-derivative term is positive, which means maximizing over $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y$ and using $|b|$:\n$$\nF(u,v) = \\frac{2a}{\\Delta x^2}(1-u) + \\frac{2c}{\\Delta y^2}(1-v) + \\frac{2|b|}{\\Delta x \\Delta y} \\sqrt{1-u^2}\\sqrt{1-v^2}\n$$\nThe maximum of $F(u,v)$ must occur either at an interior critical point where $\\nabla F = 0$, or on the boundary of the domain $[-1, 1]^2$.\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial u} = -\\frac{2a}{\\Delta x^2} - \\frac{2|b|}{\\Delta x \\Delta y} \\frac{u}{\\sqrt{1-u^2}}\\sqrt{1-v^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial v} = -\\frac{2c}{\\Delta y^2} - \\frac{2|b|}{\\Delta x \\Delta y} \\frac{v}{\\sqrt{1-v^2}}\\sqrt{1-u^2}\n$$\nSetting these to zero for $u,v \\in (-1, 1)$ requires $u<0$ and $v<0$. Multiplying the resulting equations gives $uv = (ac)/b^2$. However, the problem states $ac-b^2 > 0$, which implies $(ac)/b^2 > 1$. Since $u,v \\in (-1, 1)$, their product $|uv|$ must be less than $1$. Thus, the condition $uv = ac/b^2 > 1$ has no solution in the interior of the domain.\n\nThe maximum must therefore lie on the boundary where $u=\\pm 1$ or $v=\\pm 1$. On the boundary, one of the square root terms vanishes. For example, if $u=-1$ (which corresponds to $\\phi_x = \\pm \\pi$), the function becomes $F(-1, v) = \\frac{4a}{\\Delta x^2} + \\frac{2c}{\\Delta y^2}(1-v)$. This is a linear function of $v$, maximized at $v=-1$ (i.e., $\\phi_y = \\pm \\pi$).\nThe maximum value on the boundary is attained at the corner $(u,v) = (-1,-1)$:\n$$\n\\max F(u,v) = F(-1,-1) = \\frac{2a}{\\Delta x^2}(1-(-1)) + \\frac{2c}{\\Delta y^2}(1-(-1)) + 0 = \\frac{4a}{\\Delta x^2} + \\frac{4c}{\\Delta y^2}\n$$\nThis corresponds to the Nyquist frequencies $k_x \\Delta x = \\pm\\pi$ and $k_y \\Delta y = \\pm\\pi$. At these frequencies, the $\\sin(\\phi_x)\\sin(\\phi_y)$ term is zero.\nTherefore, the maximum value of $S(k_x, k_y)$ is:\n$$\n\\max_{k_x, k_y} S(k_x, k_y) = \\frac{4a}{\\Delta x^2} + \\frac{4c}{\\Delta y^2}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the maximum stable time step gives:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{2}{\\frac{4a}{\\Delta x^2} + \\frac{4c}{\\Delta y^2}} = \\frac{1}{2\\left(\\frac{a}{\\Delta x^2} + \\frac{c}{\\Delta y^2}\\right)}\n$$\nSimplifying this expression yields the final result:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{2\\left(\\frac{a\\Delta y^2 + c\\Delta x^2}{\\Delta x^2 \\Delta y^2}\\right)} = \\frac{\\Delta x^2 \\Delta y^2}{2(a \\Delta y^2 + c \\Delta x^2)}\n$$\nIt is remarkable that the mixed-derivative coefficient $b$ does not appear in the final stability limit.

The stability condition for the forward Euler scheme, $|G(k)| \\le 1$, becomes $|1 + \\Delta t \\lambda(k)| \\le 1$. For $\\lambda(k) \\le 0$, this is equivalent to $-2 \\le \\Delta t \\lambda(k) \\le 0$. The right-hand inequality, $\\Delta t \\lambda(k) \\le 0$, is satisfied for any $\\Delta t > 0$. The left-hand inequality, $\\Delta t \\lambda(k) \\ge -2$, gives the stability constraint:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\le \\frac{-2}{\\lambda(k)}\n$$\nTo satisfy this for all relevant modes, $\\Delta t$ must be less than or equal to the minimum of these upper bounds:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\min_{k | \\lambda(k) \\le 0} \\left( \\frac{-2}{\\lambda(k)} \\right) = \\frac{-2}{\\min_{k | \\lambda(k) \\le 0} (\\lambda(k))}\n$$\nLet us find the minimum of $\\lambda(k)$. Let $S = \\sin^2(k\\Delta x/2)$. Due to the periodic boundary conditions, $k\\Delta x$ ranges over $[-\\pi, \\pi]$, so $S$ ranges over $[0, 1]$. We can express $\\lambda$ as a function of $S$:\n$$\n\\lambda(S) = \\frac{4S}{\\Delta x^2} - \\frac{16S^2}{\\Delta x^4} = \\frac{4S}{\\Delta x^4}(\\Delta x^2 - 4S)\n$$\nThe condition $\\lambda(k) \\le 0$ is equivalent to $\\Delta x^2 - 4S \\le 0$, which means $S \\ge \\frac{\\Delta x^2}{4}$. We must therefore find the minimum of the function $\\lambda(S)$ on the interval $S \\in [\\frac{\\Delta x^2}{4}, 1]$. The function $\\lambda(S)$ is a downward-opening parabola in $S$, so its minimum over an interval must lie at one of the endpoints. We evaluate $\\lambda(S)$ at the endpoints $S = \\frac{\\Delta x^2}{4}$ and $S = 1$:\nAt $S = \\frac{\\Delta x^2}{4}$, $\\lambda(\\frac{\\Delta x^2}{4}) = 0$.\nAt $S = 1$, $\\lambda(1) = \\frac{4(1)}{\\Delta x^2} - \\frac{16(1)^2}{\\Delta x^4} = \\frac{4\\Delta x^2 - 16}{\\Delta x^4}$.\nFor small $\\Delta x$, this value is negative and thus is the minimum value of $\\lambda(k)$ for the modes under consideration. This minimum corresponds to the highest frequency mode $k\\Delta x = \\pi$.\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\min} = \\frac{4\\Delta x^2 - 16}{\\Delta x^4}\n$$\nThe maximum stable time step is then:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max}(\\Delta x) = \\frac{-2}{\\lambda_{\\min}} = \\frac{-2}{\\frac{4\\Delta x^2 - 16}{\\Delta x^4}} = \\frac{-2\\Delta x^4}{4\\Delta x^2 - 16} = \\frac{2\\Delta x^4}{16 - 4\\Delta x^2}\n$$\nTo find the asymptotic form for $\\Delta x \\to 0$, we examine the behavior of this expression:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max}(\\Delta x) \\sim \\frac{2\\Delta x^4}{16} = \\frac{1}{8}\\Delta x^{4}\n$$\nBy comparing this to the specified asymptotic form $\\Delta t_{\\max}(\\Delta x) \\sim C\\,\\Delta x^{4}$, we identify the constant $C$.\n$$\nC = \\frac{1}{8}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}$$", "id": "2441881"}]}
