{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The concept of equilibration is often visualized as a drop of dye spreading throughout a glass of water. This exercise transforms that intuitive picture into a quantitative simulation. You will model the diffusion process as a collection of independent particles undergoing Brownian motion and discover how a macroscopic property—the spatial variance of the particle ensemble, $\\sigma^2(t)$—serves as a powerful indicator of the system's journey towards a uniform, high-entropy equilibrium state. This practice provides a fundamental template for defining and measuring equilibration in a wide variety of stochastic simulations. [@problem_id:2446022]", "problem": "You are to write a complete, runnable program that simulates the diffusion of dye particles in a fluid confined to a finite hypercubic box with reflecting boundaries, and uses the variance of the particle positions, denoted by $\\sigma^2(t)$, as a measure of equilibration progression. The simulation must be formulated in discrete time with a fixed time step and proceed by evolving an ensemble of independent particles. Your program must implement the following scientifically grounded specifications.\n\n1) Fundamental model and update rule. Consider $N$ independent dye particles moving in $d$ dimensions within a hypercube of side length $L$ centered at the origin, i.e., positions $\\mathbf{x}\\in[-L/2,L/2]^d$. The motion is modeled as overdamped Brownian motion (a Wiener process) in discrete time. Over one time step of duration $\\Delta t$, each particle’s displacement in each coordinate is an independent Gaussian random variable with mean $0$ and variance $2 D \\Delta t$, where $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. That is, for each coordinate $\\alpha\\in\\{1,\\dots,d\\}$, the increment is $\\Delta x_{\\alpha}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,2 D \\Delta t)$. After the free-space update, reflecting boundaries must be enforced exactly for each coordinate by a reflection mapping that takes any coordinate $x$ to the interval $[-L/2,L/2]$ by repeated reflections. You must implement the following coordinate-wise reflection formula that handles arbitrarily large excursions in one step:\n$$\nu \\equiv \\operatorname{mod}\\!\\left(x+\\frac{L}{2},\\,2L\\right)\\in[0,2L),\\qquad\nx_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\equiv \\begin{cases}\nu-\\frac{L}{2}, & \\text{if } u\\le L, \\\\\n\\frac{3L}{2}-u, & \\text{if } u> L.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nAll particles start at the box center at time $t=0$, i.e., $\\mathbf{x}_i(0)=\\mathbf{0}$ for $i\\in\\{1,\\dots,N\\}$.\n\n2) Variance and observables. At each discrete time $t_k=k\\,\\Delta t$ for $k\\in\\{0,1,\\dots,K\\}$, compute the ensemble variance of positions\n$$\n\\sigma^2(t_k)=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left\\|\\mathbf{x}_i(t_k)-\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}(t_k)\\right\\|^2,\\qquad\n\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}(t_k)=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\mathbf{x}_i(t_k),\n$$\nwhere $\\|\\cdot\\|$ is the Euclidean norm. This scalar variance is the sum of coordinate-wise variances.\n\n3) Equilibrium target and equilibration metric. In the long-time limit under reflecting boundaries, the equilibrium distribution of positions is uniform in $[-L/2,L/2]^d$. You must analytically determine (and use in your code) the equilibrium total variance $\\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ for this uniform distribution. Define a target fraction $f\\in(0,1)$ and the corresponding threshold $\\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{thr}}=f\\,\\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{eq}}$. Define the equilibration time $\\tau_f$ to be the smallest $t_k$ for which $\\sigma^2(t_k)\\ge \\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{thr}}$. If $\\sigma^2(t)$ never reaches $\\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{thr}}$ within the simulated time window $[0,K\\,\\Delta t]$, report $\\tau_f=-1.0$.\n\n4) Early-time linear growth rate of variance. At sufficiently early times before the boundaries are significantly felt, the variance is expected to grow approximately linearly with $t$. To quantify this initial equilibration progression, estimate the initial linear growth rate $m$ of $\\sigma^2(t)$ by a least-squares fit of $\\sigma^2(t)\\approx m\\,t$ constrained to pass through the origin, using only time points with $\\sigma^2(t)\\le g\\,\\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ for a fixed gate fraction $g\\in(0,1)$. Use $g=0.2$. If fewer than a minimum number of points are available under this gate, use the first $M_{\\min}$ positive-time points instead, with $M_{\\min}=50$ or all available if fewer than $50$. The least-squares estimator constrained through the origin must be implemented as\n$$\nm=\\frac{\\sum_{j} t_j\\,\\sigma^2(t_j)}{\\sum_{j} t_j^2},\n$$\nwhere the sum is over the selected time indices $j$.\n\n5) Units. Use micrometers for length and seconds for time. The diffusion coefficient $D$ is in square micrometers per second. Report $m$ in square micrometers per second, and report $\\tau_f$ in seconds. All numeric outputs must be decimal numbers.\n\n6) Pseudo-randomness. Use a pseudo-random number generator with a fixed seed $s$ provided per test case to ensure reproducible results.\n\n7) Test suite. Your program must run the simulation for the following parameter sets, in order, and produce the required outputs for each. For each case, you are given the dimension $d$, side length $L$ in micrometers, diffusion coefficient $D$ in square micrometers per second, number of particles $N$, time step $\\Delta t$ in seconds, number of steps $K$, target fraction $f$, and random seed $s$:\n- Case A: $d=1$, $L=2.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, $D=0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$, $N=2000$, $\\Delta t=0.002\\,\\mathrm{s}$, $K=5000$, $f=0.9$, $s=12345$.\n- Case B: $d=2$, $L=5.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, $D=1.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$, $N=3000$, $\\Delta t=0.002\\,\\mathrm{s}$, $K=3500$, $f=0.9$, $s=2024$.\n- Case C: $d=3$, $L=3.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, $D=3.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$, $N=2500$, $\\Delta t=0.0015\\,\\mathrm{s}$, $K=3000$, $f=0.9$, $s=777$.\n- Case D: $d=1$, $L=10.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, $D=2.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$, $N=1500$, $\\Delta t=0.001\\,\\mathrm{s}$, $K=2000$, $f=0.9$, $s=4242$.\n\n8) Required outputs. For each case, compute and return a two-element list $[m,\\tau_f]$, where $m$ is the initial linear growth rate in $\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$ and $\\tau_f$ is the equilibration time in $\\mathrm{s}$ as defined above (use $\\tau_f=-1.0$ if the threshold is not reached). Aggregate the results for all four cases into a single list in the same order as the cases.\n\nFinal output format. Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each element is itself a two-element list in the order $[m,\\tau_f]$, for example, $[[m_1,\\tau_{f,1}],[m_2,\\tau_{f,2}],[m_3,\\tau_{f,3}],[m_4,\\tau_{f,4}]]$.", "solution": "The problem statement has been subjected to rigorous validation and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and provides a complete and consistent set of specifications for a standard computational physics simulation. We will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the simulation of overdamped Brownian motion in a confined volume and the analysis of its equilibration dynamics. The solution is structured upon fundamental principles of statistical mechanics and stochastic processes, which are then implemented algorithmically.\n\nFirst, we establish the necessary theoretical groundwork.\n\n**1. Equilibrium State and Variance**\n\nIn the long-time limit ($t \\to \\infty$), the ensemble of particles diffusing within a box with reflecting boundaries will reach a state of thermal equilibrium. In this state, the probability density function for a particle's position is uniform over the volume of the box. For a $d$-dimensional hypercube of side length $L$ centered at the origin, each coordinate $x_{\\alpha}$ for $\\alpha \\in \\{1, \\dots, d\\}$ is an independent random variable uniformly distributed on the interval $[-L/2, L/2]$.\n\nThe variance of a continuous uniform random variable on $[a, b]$ is $(b-a)^2/12$. For a single coordinate $x_{\\alpha}$, this gives:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(x_{\\alpha}) = \\frac{(L/2 - (-L/2))^2}{12} = \\frac{L^2}{12}\n$$\nThe problem defines the total variance as $\\sigma^2(t) = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left\\|\\mathbf{x}_i(t)-\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}(t)\\right\\|^2$. For a large ensemble ($N \\to \\infty$), the sample mean $\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}(t)$ converges to the true mean of the distribution, which is $\\mathbf{0}$ by symmetry. So, the equilibrium variance $\\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ is the expectation value of the squared norm of the position vector, $E[\\|\\mathbf{X}\\|^2]$.\n$$\n\\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{eq}} = E\\left[\\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{d} x_{\\alpha}^2\\right] = \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{d} E[x_{\\alpha}^2]\n$$\nSince the mean of each coordinate is $E[x_{\\alpha}] = 0$, we have $E[x_{\\alpha}^2] = \\mathrm{Var}(x_{\\alpha})$. Therefore, the theoretical equilibrium variance is:\n$$\n\\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{d} \\frac{L^2}{12} = \\frac{d L^2}{12}\n$$\nThis analytical result is essential for defining the equilibration threshold $\\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{thr}} = f \\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{eq}}$.\n\n**2. Early-Time Dynamics and Growth Rate**\n\nAt very early times, before particles have had a chance to interact significantly with the boundaries, their motion is approximately that of free diffusion in an infinite space. For a particle starting at the origin, the mean-squared displacement (MSD) at time $t$ is given by the Einstein relation:\n$$\n\\langle \\|\\mathbf{x}(t)\\|^2 \\rangle = 2dDt\n$$\nHere, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient and $d$ is the dimensionality. The ensemble variance $\\sigma^2(t)$ is closely related to the MSD. For large $N$, $\\sigma^2(t) \\approx \\langle \\|\\mathbf{x}(t)\\|^2 \\rangle$. Thus, we expect a linear growth regime:\n$$\n\\sigma^2(t) \\approx (2dD)t\n$$\nThis implies that the initial linear growth rate $m$ should be theoretically close to $m_{\\mathrm{theory}} = 2dD$. The numerical estimation of $m$ from the simulation data serves as a verification of the simulation's correctness.\n\n**3. Algorithmic Implementation**\n\nThe simulation will be implemented based on the following algorithmic design.\n\n**Simulation Core:**\nA main loop iterates over discrete time steps $k = 0, 1, \\dots, K$. The state of the system is represented by a NumPy array `positions` of shape $(N, d)$, where $N$ is the number of particles and $d$ is the dimension. This array is initialized to zeros, as all particles start at the origin. At each step, observables are calculated, and then particle positions are updated.\n\n**Stochastic Update:**\nThe motion of each particle is governed by a discrete-time Wiener process. The displacement in each coordinate over a time step $\\Delta t$ is drawn from a normal distribution. For efficiency, we generate an $(N, d)$ array of random numbers at once. The standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution for each displacement component is $\\sigma_{\\Delta x} = \\sqrt{2D\\Delta t}$. The update rule is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}_i(t_{k+1}) = \\mathbf{x}_i(t_k) + \\Delta \\mathbf{x}_i\n$$\nwhere each component of $\\Delta \\mathbf{x}_i$ is drawn from $\\mathcal{N}(0, 2D\\Delta t)$.\n\n**Boundary Conditions:**\nAfter the free-space displacement, reflecting boundaries must be enforced. The provided formula is implemented in a vectorized fashion for all particles and coordinates simultaneously. The coordinate $x$ is first mapped to a value $u$ in the double-width interval $[0, 2L)$ using the modulo operator.\n$$\nu = \\operatorname{mod}(x + L/2, 2L)\n$$\nThen, a conditional mapping folds the position back into the primary interval $[-L/2, L/2]$. This is efficiently achieved using `numpy.where`, which applies a different formula based on whether $u > L$.\n\n**Observable Calculation:**\nAt each time step $t_k$, the ensemble variance $\\sigma^2(t_k)$ is computed. The most direct translation of the formula $\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left\\|\\mathbf{x}_i(t_k)-\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}(t_k)\\right\\|^2$ is prone to floating-point errors and is less efficient than using built-in NumPy functions. A numerically stable and efficient method is to compute the variance of each coordinate separately and sum the results. This is achieved with `numpy.var(positions, axis=0)`, which computes the variance along the particle axis, followed by a sum over the resulting dimensional variances.\n\n**Post-Simulation Analysis:**\nAfter completing the simulation loop and populating arrays of times $t_k$ and variances $\\sigma^2(t_k)$, we calculate the two required metrics.\n\n*   **Equilibration Time ($\\tau_f$):** We search for the first index $k$ where $\\sigma^2(t_k) \\ge \\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{thr}}$. The corresponding time $t_k$ is the result $\\tau_f$. If no such index exists, $\\tau_f$ is set to $-1.0$, as specified. This is accomplished by finding all indices satisfying the condition and taking the first one if the set is not empty.\n\n*   **Initial Slope ($m$):** The data points $(t_k, \\sigma^2(t_k))$ for the linear fit $y = mx$ are selected based on a two-stage logic to ensure a robust estimate of the initial rate.\n    1.  First, we identify all positive-time points where the variance is below a gate: $\\sigma^2(t_k) \\le g\\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{eq}}$, with $g=0.2$.\n    2.  If the number of these points is greater than or equal to a minimum threshold $M_{\\min}=50$, these points are used for the fit.\n    3.  Otherwise, as a fallback, we use the first $M_{\\min}$ positive-time points (or all available positive-time points if the total number of steps $K$ is less than $M_{\\min}$).\n    The slope $m$ is then calculated using the provided least-squares formula, $m = (\\sum_j t_j \\sigma^2_j) / (\\sum_j t_j^2)$, where the sums are over the selected indices $j$. This calculation is performed using vectorized NumPy operations.\n\nThis completes the design.

This practice delves into the fascinating case of the Tonks gas, a system of one-dimensional hard rods, which serves as a prime example of an integrable system. By simulating its dynamics and tracking the velocity distribution, you will find that it never reaches the expected Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, a direct consequence of hidden conservation laws that severely restrict its dynamics. This exercise is a powerful lesson on the limits of the ergodic hypothesis and the existence of systems that perpetually \"remember\" their initial conditions. [@problem_id:2445986]", "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional gas of identical hard rods, also known as a Tonks gas. The system consists of $N$ identical rods of length $a$ and mass $m$ moving on a ring of circumference $L$ with periodic boundary conditions. The rods interact only through impenetrable hard-core repulsion: when two neighboring rods come into contact (their surfaces touch), they undergo an instantaneous, perfectly elastic collision that preserves total momentum and total kinetic energy. In one dimension with equal masses, a pairwise elastic collision is equivalent to an exchange of the two colliding velocities. Between collisions, each rod moves at constant velocity. Use reduced, dimensionless units in which $m=1$ and the Boltzmann constant $k_{\\mathrm{B}}=1$, so that no physical units are involved.\n\nYour task is to determine, by first-principles reasoning and computational verification, whether the long-time single-particle velocity distribution of the Tonks gas approaches the one-dimensional Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. In one dimension, the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution for velocities is a Gaussian distribution. Specifically, for a temperature $T$, the equilibrium probability density of a single velocity $v$ is\n$$\nf(v; \\mu, \\sigma) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,\\sigma}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(v-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right),\n$$\nwith mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma = \\sqrt{T}$ in these reduced units, and equivalently $\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\langle v^2\\rangle}$ if $\\mu=0$.\n\nFor each test case below, simulate the Tonks gas for a sufficiently long time so that any putative equilibration would be observable, then evaluate whether the final single-particle velocity distribution is consistent with a one-dimensional Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution.

This problem appears to concern the thermalization of a many-body system, but it is, in fact, a test of understanding the fundamental principles of a one-dimensional integrable system. Any competent student should recognize the Tonks gas for what it is.\n\nThe key to this problem lies in the nature of one-dimensional, elastic collisions between identical particles. When two such particles of mass $m$ collide, their velocities are exchanged. As the particles are indistinguishable, this outcome is kinematically equivalent to a scenario where the particles pass through each other without any interaction. Consequently, the set of individual particle velocities, $\\{v_i\\}_{i=1}^N$, is a constant of motion. The velocities are merely permuted among the particles as collisions occur, but the collection of values in the set remains invariant for all time $t$.\n\nThis property signifies that the Tonks gas is an integrable system. It possesses $N$ conserved quantities (the individual velocities), which is equal to the number of its degrees of freedom. As a direct result, the system does not thermalize in the conventional sense. The single-particle velocity distribution function, $f(v,t)$, does not evolve over time. It is fixed by the initial conditions: $f(v,t) = f(v,0)$.\n\nTherefore, the question of whether the long-time velocity distribution approaches the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is rendered trivial. The distribution does not \"approach\" anything; it is static. The system's velocity distribution will be Maxwell-Boltzmann at time $t > 0$ if, and only if, it was prepared in a Maxwell-Boltzmann state at $t=0$. The simulation requested for a time $t_{\\mathrm{final}}=100$ is, in principle, superfluous for determining the final distribution, as the Kolmogorov distance $D$ will also be a constant of motion. However, for the sake of rigorous verification as per the problem statement, we shall perform the simulation.\n\nThe simulation will be conducted using an event-driven algorithm, which is the correct and efficient method for a system of hard particles. We calculate the time to the next collision for all adjacent pairs on the ring, advance the system by the minimum of these times, and then update the velocities of the colliding particles by swapping them. Since the particles cannot pass one another, their ordering on the ring is preserved, which simplifies the identification of neighboring pairs.\n\nThe final velocity distribution is analyzed using the Kolmogorov distance $D$, which measures the maximum difference between the empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF) $F(v)$ of the velocities and the CDF of a normal distribution, $\\Phi$, with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$ derived from the velocity sample itself. The condition for consistency with a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is given as $D \\le \\delta$, where the tolerance is $\\delta=0.08$.\n\nWe now analyze each test case based on this physical principle:\n\nCase $1$: $N=512$, $L=10$, $a=0.01$, with initial velocities drawn from a Gaussian distribution at temperature $T=1$ and zero total momentum. The initial velocity distribution is, by construction, an excellent approximation of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Since the distribution is invariant, the final distribution will also be so. We thus expect the Kolmogorov distance $D$ to be small and satisfy the condition $D \\le 0.08$. The expected outcome is true.\n\nCase $2$: $N=512$, $L=10$, $a=0.01$, with a bimodal initial velocity distribution where half the particles have velocity $v_0=1$ and the other half have velocity $-v_0=-1$. This distribution consists of two delta functions and is manifestly not Gaussian. Its mean is $\\mu=0$ and its variance is $\\sigma^2=1$. The large discrepancy between this two-step empirical CDF and a continuous Gaussian CDF will result in a large value of $D$. As the distribution does not change, the final value of $D$ will be large. We expect $D > 0.08$. The expected outcome is false.\n\nCase $3$: $N=2$, $L=1.0$, $a=0.1$, with initial velocities $(-1, +1)$. This is a special instance of the bimodal case with $N=2$. The velocity distribution is $\\{ -1, 1 \\}$, which is not Gaussian. For the same reason as in Case $2$, the Kolmogorov distance $D$ will be large. We expect $D > 0.08$.

This final practice explores a critical, often-overlooked pitfall: the quality of the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) in a Monte Carlo simulation. By simulating the classic Ising model with both a high-quality PRNG and a deliberately biased one, you will witness firsthand how a flawed generator can break the fundamental principle of detailed balance, trap the system in a non-equilibrium state, and lead to completely erroneous conclusions. This is an essential, practical lesson in computational hygiene, demonstrating that trusting your tools blindly can invalidate your science. [@problem_id:2445950]", "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional Ising chain of $N$ spins with periodic boundary conditions, where each spin $s_i \\in \\{+1,-1\\}$ and the Hamiltonian is $H(\\{s\\}) = -J \\sum_{i=1}^{N} s_i s_{i+1}$ with $s_{N+1} \\equiv s_1$. Assume $J=1$ and Boltzmann constant $k_\\mathrm{B}=1$, so that the inverse temperature is $\\beta = 1/T$. The system is coupled to a canonical heat bath at temperature $T$ and evolves according to a Metropolis Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) dynamics defined as follows: at each attempted update, a site index $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,N\\}$ is chosen uniformly at random, a proposal $s_i \\to -s_i$ is made, and the move is accepted with probability $\\min\\{1,\\exp(-\\beta \\Delta E)\\}$ where $\\Delta E$ is the energy change of the proposed flip. One sweep consists of $N$ such attempted updates. The initial configuration is the fully ordered state $s_i=+1$ for all $i$.\n\nThe exact equilibrium energy per spin in the thermodynamic limit for the one-dimensional Ising model at inverse temperature $\\beta$ and $J=1$ is $u^*(\\beta) = -\\tanh(\\beta)$. Define the equilibration time $\\tau_\\mathrm{eq}$ (in sweeps) for a given simulation and parameter set as the smallest sweep index $t \\ge W$ such that the absolute difference between the moving average of the measured energy per spin over the most recent $W$ sweeps and $u^*(\\beta)$ is less than or equal to a prescribed tolerance $\\delta$. If no such $t$ exists up to a maximum number of sweeps $S_\\max$, define $\\tau_\\mathrm{eq} = S_\\max + 1$.\n\nTwo distinct sources of uniformly distributed numbers in $[0,1)$ are used to drive the stochastic choices in the MCMC dynamics (both for site selection and for acceptance decisions):\n\n- Generator $\\mathcal{H}$ (high quality): an idealized source of independent draws from the continuous uniform distribution on $[0,1)$.\n- Generator $\\mathcal{L}$ (low quality): a biased pseudo-random number generator constructed from the linear congruential recurrence $x_{n+1} = (a x_n + c) \\bmod m$ with parameters $m=2^{31}$, $a=1103515245$, and $c=12345$, seeded by an integer $x_0$. The output variate is defined as $u_n = \\tfrac{1}{2} + \\frac{(x_n \\bmod (m/2))}{m}$, which yields values in the half-interval $[1/2,1)$ only.\n\nFor each test case listed below, simulate the dynamics as defined above using generator $\\mathcal{H}$ to compute $\\tau_\\mathrm{eq}^{(\\mathcal{H})}$ and using generator $\\mathcal{L}$ to compute $\\tau_\\mathrm{eq}^{(\\mathcal{L})}$, with the same physical parameters but possibly different seeds as specified.

This process is to be performed for two different pseudo-random number generators (RNGs), one of high quality ($\\mathcal{H}$) and one of low quality ($\\mathcal{L}$), to analyze the effect of RNG bias on simulation dynamics.\n\nThe system is an Ising chain of $N$ spins $s_i \\in \\{+1, -1\\}$ with periodic boundary conditions. The Hamiltonian is given by $H = -J \\sum_{i=1}^{N} s_i s_{i+1}$, with $J=1$. The system evolves via single-spin-flip Metropolis dynamics. At each step, a site $i$ is chosen randomly, and a flip $s_i \\to -s_i$ is proposed. The change in energy, $\\Delta E$, for such a flip is localized to the spin's neighbors:\n$$ \\Delta E = 2J s_i (s_{i-1} + s_{i+1}) $$\nWith $J=1$ and $s_i, s_{i-1}, s_{i+1} \\in \\{+1, -1\\}$, the possible non-zero values for $\\Delta E$ are $\\pm 4$. A move is accepted with probability $p = \\min\\{1, \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta E)\\}$, where $\\beta=1/T$ is the inverse temperature ($k_B=1$). The initial state is fully ordered, $s_i = +1$ for all $i$, corresponding to the ground state energy $E = -N$.\n\nThe equilibration time $\\tau_\\mathrm{eq}$ is defined as the first sweep $t \\ge W$ where the moving average of the energy per spin, $u_t = E_t/N$, over the last $W$ sweeps is within a tolerance $\\delta$ of the exact equilibrium energy per spin in the thermodynamic limit, $u^*(\\beta) = -\\tanh(\\beta)$. That is, $|\\text{MA}_W(u,t) - u^*(\\beta)| \\le \\delta$.\n\nThe two RNGs are:\n1.  Generator $\\mathcal{H}$: An ideal uniform RNG on $[0,1)$, implemented using `numpy.random.default_rng`.\n2.  Generator $\\mathcal{L}$: A biased Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) with recurrence $x_{n+1} = (a x_n + c) \\bmod m$ for $a=1103515245$, $c=12345$, $m=2^{31}$. The output is constructed as $u_n = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{(x_n \\bmod (m/2))}{m}$, which generates variates exclusively in the interval $[0.5, 1)$.\n\nThe bias of generator $\\mathcal{L}$ has profound consequences for the Metropolis algorithm.\nFirst, consider the acceptance step. An energetically unfavorable move ($\\Delta E > 0$) is accepted if a random number $r$ satisfies $r < \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta E)$. Since generator $\\mathcal{L}$ produces $r \\ge 0.5$, any move for which the acceptance probability $\\exp(-\\beta \\Delta E)$ is less than $0.5$ will be systematically rejected. The only move that increases energy has $\\Delta E = 4$. The condition for this move to be *ever* accepted is $\\exp(-4\\beta) \\ge 0.5$, which simplifies to $\\beta \\le \\frac{\\ln(2)}{4} \\approx 0.173$. For any $\\beta > \\frac{\\ln(2)}{4}$, the simulation driven by $\\mathcal{L}$ cannot accept any energy-increasing moves. Since the system starts in the ground state (all spins up), it will remain trapped in this state, as any spin flip increases the energy. For test cases $1$ ($\\beta=0.5$), $2$ ($\\beta=1.0$), and $4$ ($\\beta=2.0$), this condition holds. The energy per spin for these simulations will remain constant at $u=-1$. The equilibration condition $|-1 - (-\\tanh(\\beta))| \\le 0.02$ is not met for any of these cases, so $\\tau_\\mathrm{eq}^{(\\mathcal{L})}$ is assigned the failure value $S_\\max + 1$.\n\nSecond, consider the site selection. To select a site index from $\\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$, one typically computes $\\lfloor N \\times r \\rfloor$. With $r \\in [0.5, 1)$ from generator $\\mathcal{L}$, the selected site index will always be in the range $\\{\\lfloor N/2 \\rfloor, \\dots, N-1\\}$. This means only the second half of the spin chain is ever directly updated. This spatial bias further hinders equilibration, as thermal fluctuations must propagate from one half of the system to the other via boundary interactions only.\n\nFor case $3$ ($\\beta=0.1$), we have $\\beta < 0.173$, so energy-increasing moves are possible with generator $\\mathcal{L}$. However, their acceptance probability is severely reduced compared to an ideal generator, and the site selection remains biased. We expect this to significantly slow down equilibration, leading to $\\tau_\\mathrm{eq}^{(\\mathcal{L})} > \\tau_\\mathrm{eq}^{(\\mathcal{H})}$.\n\nThe solution involves implementing the simulation for both generators for each test case. For generator $\\mathcal{H}$, a full simulation is always run. For generator $\\mathcal{L}$, we exploit the trapping phenomenon for cases $1, 2,$ and $4$ to assign $\\tau_\\mathrm{eq}^{(\\mathcal{L})}$ directly. For case $3$, a full simulation is required for $\\mathcal{L}$ as well. Finally, the ratio $R = \\tau_\\mathrm{eq}^{(\\mathcal{L})} / \\tau_\\mathrm{eq}^{(\\mathcal{H})}$ is computed for each case.\n\nThe implementation will consist of:\n1.
