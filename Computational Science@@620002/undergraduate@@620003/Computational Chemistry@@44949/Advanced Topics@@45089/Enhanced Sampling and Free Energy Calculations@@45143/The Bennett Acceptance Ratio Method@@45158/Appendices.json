Before we can confidently apply the BAR method, we must ensure our fundamental tools are robust against common pitfalls like floating-point overflow, a critical skill for any computational scientist [@problem_id:2463465].", "problem": "You are given the definition of the Fermi function $f(x)$ that appears inside the Bennett acceptance ratio method (BAR, Bennett acceptance ratio method) for free-energy differences in computational chemistry:\n$$\nf(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{x}}.\n$$\nDirect evaluation of $e^{x}$ in standard double-precision floating-point arithmetic can lead to overflow for large positive $x$ and severe underflow for large negative $x$. Your task is to implement a numerically stable computation of $f(x)$ for all real $x$, using double-precision arithmetic.

The Fermi function (or logistic sigmoid function) is fundamental, and the potential for floating-point overflow and underflow in its direct evaluation is a classic, non-controversial issue in scientific computing. The specified input values, such as $709$ and $710$, are correctly chosen to probe the overflow boundary for $e^x$ in standard $64$-bit double-precision arithmetic, where the overflow threshold is $x \\approx 709.78$.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It requests the implementation of an algorithm to overcome a specific, well-defined numerical instability. A unique and stable solution is attainable through standard numerical techniques.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and unambiguous terms. It is free of any subjective or opinion-based content.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is determined to be **valid**. It is a standard exercise in numerical programming that is both scientifically sound and clearly specified. Proceeding to solution.\n\nA robust solution requires an analysis of the function's behavior and the limitations of floating-point arithmetic. The function is given by:\n$$\nf(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{x}}\n$$\nWe analyze the numerical stability of this expression for different regimes of the input variable $x$.\n\nCase 1: $x$ is large and positive.\nFor large positive $x$, the term $e^x$ grows exponentially. In standard IEEE $754$ double-precision arithmetic, the maximum representable finite value is approximately $1.8 \\times 10^{308}$. The exponential function $e^x$ will overflow when $x > \\ln(1.8 \\times 10^{308}) \\approx 709.78$. A direct computation for $x$ values such as $710$ or $1000$ would lead to an intermediate infinite value, which is poor numerical practice even if the final result is correctly resolved to $0$ by the floating-point unit's rules for `inf`.\n\nTo create a stable algorithm, we must reformulate the expression to avoid computing $e^x$ for positive $x$. We can multiply the numerator and denominator by $e^{-x}$:\n$$\nf(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{x}} = \\frac{e^{-x}}{e^{-x}(1 + e^{x})} = \\frac{e^{-x}}{e^{-x} + 1}\n$$\nIn this alternative form, if $x$ is positive, then $-x$ is negative. The evaluation of $e^{-x}$ will result in a value between $0$ and $1$, thus preventing overflow. This form is numerically stable for $x \\ge 0$.\n\nCase 2: $x$ is large and negative.\nFor large negative $x$, the term $e^x$ approaches $0$. In double-precision, $e^x$ will underflow to exactly $0$ for $x < \\ln(2.2 \\times 10^{-308}) \\approx -708.4$. In this case, the direct computation $f(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^x}$ becomes $\\frac{1}{1 + 0} = 1$. This computation is numerically stable and gives the correct limiting value. There is no risk of overflow or catastrophic cancellation.\n\nCase 3: $x$ is near $0$.\nFor $x=0$, both forms yield $f(0) = \\frac{1}{1+e^0} = \\frac{1}{2}$, which is stable.\n\nBased on this analysis, a hybrid algorithm that selects the appropriate formula based on the sign of $x$ provides complete numerical stability across the entire real number line.\n\nThe proposed stable algorithm is as follows:\n-   If $x < 0$, use the original form: $f(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^x}$. The argument to the exponential function is negative, ensuring stability.\n-   If $x \\ge 0$, use the algebraically equivalent form: $f(x) = \\frac{e^{-x}}{1 + e^{-x}}$. The argument to the exponential function is non-positive, again ensuring stability.\n\nThis strategy guarantees that the argument passed to the exponential function is always less than or equal to zero, thereby robustly preventing overflow and producing a finite result for any real input $x$.

The system consists of a single particle in a two-dimensional potential. Before proceeding to the numerical implementation, a rigorous analysis of the underlying physical model and the numerical method is mandatory.\n\nFirst, we analyze the potential energy function. The reduced potential energy for a state defined by a parameter $q$ is given by:\n$$\nu(q;\\mathbf{r}) = \\tfrac{1}{2} k \\left(x^2 + y^2\\right) - q \\, \\mathbf{E} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{r}=(x,y)$, $k>0$, and $\\mathbf{E}=(E_x, E_y)$. To understand the statistical properties of the system, we must identify the form of the Boltzmann distribution, $p(\\mathbf{r}) \\propto \\exp(-u(q;\\mathbf{r}))$. We can rewrite the potential by completing the square for the $x$ and $y$ coordinates:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nu(q;\\mathbf{r}) &= \\left(\\tfrac{1}{2} k x^2 - q E_x x\\right) + \\left(\\tfrac{1}{2} k y^2 - q E_y y\\right) \\\\\n&= \\tfrac{k}{2} \\left[x^2 - \\tfrac{2qE_x}{k} x\\right] + \\tfrac{k}{2} \\left[y^2 - \\tfrac{2qE_y}{k} y\\right] \\\\\n&= \\tfrac{k}{2} \\left[\\left(x - \\tfrac{qE_x}{k}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\tfrac{qE_x}{k}\\right)^2\\right] + \\tfrac{k}{2} \\left[\\left(y - \\tfrac{qE_y}{k}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\tfrac{qE_y}{k}\\right)^2\\right] \\\\\n&= \\tfrac{k}{2} \\left(x - \\tfrac{qE_x}{k}\\right)^2 + \\tfrac{k}{2} \\left(y - \\tfrac{qE_y}{k}\\right)^2 - \\tfrac{q^2}{2k}(E_x^2 + E_y^2)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThe probability density function is therefore:\n$$\np(q;\\mathbf{r}) \\propto \\exp\\left\\{ -\\tfrac{k}{2} \\left[\\left(x - \\tfrac{qE_x}{k}\\right)^2 + \\left(y - \\tfrac{qE_y}{k}\\right)^2\\right] \\right\\}\n$$\nThis is the kernel of a bivariate normal (Gaussian) distribution, $\\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}(q), \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma})$. The mean vector $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}(q)$ and covariance matrix $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ are identified by comparing the exponent to the standard form $-\\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{r}-\\boldsymbol{\\mu})^T \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1} (\\mathbf{r}-\\boldsymbol{\\mu})$.\nThe mean vector is:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\mu}(q) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mu_x(q) \\\\ \\mu_y(q) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} qE_x/k \\\\ qE_y/k \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{q}{k}\\mathbf{E}\n$$\nThe inverse covariance matrix is $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1} = k \\mathbf{I}$, where $\\mathbf{I}$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix.

To generate the required samples for states $A$ and $B$, one must draw from $\\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}(q_A), \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma})$ and $\\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}(q_B), \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma})$, respectively.\n\nNext, we address the BAR equation itself. The equation requires the evaluation of the potential energy difference, $\\Delta u(\\mathbf{r})$:\n$$\n\\Delta u(\\mathbf{r}) = u_B(\\mathbf{r}) - u_A(\\mathbf{r}) = u(q_B;\\mathbf{r}) - u(q_A;\\mathbf{r})\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta u(\\mathbf{r}) = \\left(\\tfrac{1}{2} k r^2 - q_B \\mathbf{E} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}\\right) - \\left(\\tfrac{1}{2} k r^2 - q_A \\mathbf{E} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}\\right) = -(q_B - q_A) \\mathbf{E} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}\n$$\nLet $\\Delta q = q_B - q_A$. Then $\\Delta u(\\mathbf{r}) = -\\Delta q \\, (\\mathbf{E} \\cdot \\mathbf{r})$.\nThe BAR equation for $\\Delta f_{BA}$ is:\n$$\n\\left\\langle \\frac{1}{1+\\exp\\left(\\Delta u(\\mathbf{r}) - \\Delta f_{BA} - c\\right)} \\right\\rangle_A = \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{1+\\exp\\left(-\\Delta u(\\mathbf{r}) + \\Delta f_{BA} + c\\right)} \\right\\rangle_B\n$$\nwhere $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle_X$ denotes the sample average over configurations drawn from state $X$, and $c = \\ln(N_B/N_A)$. This is a non-linear equation for the unknown $\\Delta f_{BA}$. We can define an objective function $g(\\Delta f)$ whose root is the desired solution:\n$$\ng(\\Delta f) = \\frac{1}{N_A} \\sum_{i=1}^{N_A} \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\Delta u(\\mathbf{r}_i^{(A)}) - \\Delta f - c}} - \\frac{1}{N_B} \\sum_{j=1}^{N_B} \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\Delta u(\\mathbf{r}_j^{(B)}) + \\Delta f + c}}\n$$\nThe function $g(\\Delta f)$ is continuous and strictly monotonically increasing with respect to $\\Delta f$. As $\\Delta f \\to -\\infty$, $g(\\Delta f) \\to -1$. As $\\Delta f \\to +\\infty$, $g(\\Delta f) \\to 1$. Consequently, a unique root for $g(\\Delta f) = 0$ is guaranteed to exist. This root must be found using a numerical root-finding algorithm, such as Brent's method.\n\nFor this specific problem, an analytical solution for the free energy difference exists, which serves as a crucial check on the numerical results. The reduced partition function $Z(q)$ is:\n$$\nZ(q) = \\int e^{-u(q;\\mathbf{r})} d\\mathbf{r} = e^{\\frac{q^2 E^2}{2k}} \\int \\int e^{-\\frac{k}{2}(x-\\mu_x)^2} e^{-\\frac{k}{2}(y-\\mu_y)^2} dx dy\n$$\nwhere $E^2 = |\\mathbf{E}|^2$. Each integral is a standard Gaussian integral evaluating to $\\sqrt{2\\pi/k}$.\n$$\nZ(q) = e^{\\frac{q^2 E^2}{2k}} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{k}\\right)\n$$\nThe reduced free energy is $f(q) = -\\ln Z(q) = -\\frac{q^2 E^2}{2k} - \\ln\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{k}\\right)$. The exact free energy difference is therefore:\n$$\n\\Delta f_{BA} = f(q_B) - f(q_A) = \\left[-\\frac{q_B^2 E^2}{2k} - \\ln\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{k}\\right)\\right] - \\left[-\\frac{q_A^2 E^2}{2k} - \\ln\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{k}\\right)\\right] = -\\frac{(q_B^2 - q_A^2)E^2}{2k}\n$$\nThe numerically estimated $\\Delta f_{BA}$ from the BAR equation using a finite number of samples should be a statistical estimate of this exact theoretical value.\n\nThe computational procedure is as follows:\n1. For each test case, set the parameters $(k, q_A, q_B, \\mathbf{E}, N_A, N_B)$ and the random number generator seed.\n2. Generate $N_A$ samples $\\mathbf{r}_i^{(A)}$ from $\\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}(q_A), \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma})$ and $N_B$ samples $\\mathbf{r}_j^{(B)}$ from $\\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}(q_B), \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma})$.\n3.

This final practice encourages you to think critically about the statistical properties of the BAR estimator by investigating its behavior with very small sample sizes. By using a simple harmonic oscillator system where the exact free energy difference $\\Delta F$ is known analytically, you will directly compute the estimator's bias, gaining valuable insight into the reliability and limitations of statistical methods in the small-data regime [@problem_id:2463439].", "problem": "You are given two classical one-dimensional harmonic oscillator states, denoted by state $\\mathrm{A}$ and state $\\mathrm{B}$. The reduced potential energy (in units of Boltzmann constant times temperature, $k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$) of a configuration $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ in state $\\mathrm{A}$ is $u_{\\mathrm{A}}(x) = \\tfrac{1}{2} k_{\\mathrm{A}} (x - \\mu_{\\mathrm{A}})^{2}$, and in state $\\mathrm{B}$ is $u_{\\mathrm{B}}(x) = \\tfrac{1}{2} k_{\\mathrm{B}} (x - \\mu_{\\mathrm{B}})^{2}$. Assume the inverse temperature is $\\beta = 1$ so that all energies are dimensionless in units of $k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$.

The output values are dimensionless. No other text should be printed.", "solution": "The problem statement has been subjected to rigorous validation and is deemed valid. It presents a well-posed, scientifically grounded computational problem in the domain of statistical mechanics. The model system, a classical one-dimensional harmonic oscillator, and the methodology, the Bennett Acceptance Ratio (BAR), are standard and correctly described. All parameters and procedures are explicitly defined, ensuring the problem is self-contained and allows for a unique, verifiable solution. We shall proceed with the calculation.\n\nThe task is to compute the bias, $b = \\widehat{\\Delta f} - \\Delta F_{\\mathrm{exact}}$, of the BAR free energy estimator for five distinct cases. The estimator $\\widehat{\\Delta f}$ is the calculated free energy difference from simulated data, and $\\Delta F_{\\mathrm{exact}}$ is the analytical value.\n\nFirst, we establish the analytical quantities. The reduced potential energies for the two states, $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$, are given by:\n$$\nu_{\\mathrm{A}}(x) = \\frac{1}{2} k_{\\mathrm{A}} (x - \\mu_{\\mathrm{A}})^{2}\n$$\n$$\nu_{\\mathrm{B}}(x) = \\frac{1}{2} k_{\\mathrm{B}} (x - \\mu_{\\mathrm{B}})^{2}\n$$\nThe exact reduced free energy difference between these states is:\n$$\n\\Delta F_{\\mathrm{exact}} = F_{\\mathrm{B}} - F_{\\mathrm{A}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}}{k_{\\mathrm{A}}}\\right)\n$$\nThis formula is derived from the classical partition functions of the harmonic oscillators and will serve as the reference value for calculating the bias.\n\nThe computational procedure involves generating finite samples of configurations. For state $\\mathrm{A}$, $N_{\\mathrm{A}}$ configurations $\\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^{N_{\\mathrm{A}}}$ are drawn from its canonical distribution. For a harmonic oscillator, this distribution is a Gaussian with mean $\\mu_{\\mathrm{A}}$ and variance $\\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{A}} = 1/k_{\\mathrm{A}}$. Similarly, for state $\\mathrm{B}$, $N_{\\mathrm{B}}$ configurations $\\{y_j\\}_{j=1}^{N_{\\mathrm{B}}}$ are drawn from a Gaussian distribution with mean $\\mu_{\\mathrm{B}}$ and variance $\\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{B}} = 1/k_{\\mathrm{B}}$. The random samples will be generated using the specified seeds for reproducibility.\n\nOnce the samples are obtained, we calculate the work values. The forward work values are the energy differences evaluated on samples from state $\\mathrm{A}$:\n$$\n\\Delta u_{i} = u_{\\mathrm{B}}(x_{i}) - u_{\\mathrm{A}}(x_{i}), \\quad i = 1, \\dots, N_{\\mathrm{A}}\n$$\nThe reverse work values are evaluated on samples from state $\\mathrm{B}$:\n$$\n\\Delta u'_{j} = u_{\\mathrm{A}}(y_{j}) - u_{\\mathrm{B}}(y_{j}), \\quad j = 1, \\dots, N_{\\mathrm{B}}\n$$\n\nThe BAR estimate of the free energy difference, $\\widehat{\\Delta f}$, is the solution to the following implicit equation:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\\mathrm{A}}} \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\!\\left(\\Delta u_{i} - \\widehat{\\Delta f} + C \\right)} = \\sum_{j=1}^{N_{\\mathrm{B}}} \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\!\\left(\\Delta u'_{j} + \\widehat{\\Delta f} - C \\right)}\n$$\nwhere $C = \\ln(N_{\\mathrm{A}}/N_{\\mathrm{B}})$. To find $\\widehat{\\Delta f}$, we define a function $G(\\widehat{\\Delta f})$ as the difference between the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of the equation, which must be equal to zero:\n$$\nG(\\widehat{\\Delta f}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\\mathrm{A}}} \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\!\\left(\\Delta u_{i} - \\widehat{\\Delta f} + C \\right)} - \\sum_{j=1}^{N_{\\mathrm{B}}} \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\!\\left(\\Delta u'_{j} + \\widehat{\\Delta f} - C \\right)} = 0\n$$\nThe function $G(\\widehat{\\Delta f})$ is strictly monotonic. Its first derivative with respect to $\\widehat{\\Delta f}$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dG}{d\\widehat{\\Delta f}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\\mathrm{A}}} \\frac{\\exp(\\dots)}{(1+\\exp(\\dots))^2} + \\sum_{j=1}^{N_{\\mathrm{B}}} \\frac{\\exp(\\dots)}{(1+\\exp(\\dots))^2}\n$$\nwhere the arguments of the exponentials are the same as in the definition of $G(\\widehat{\\Delta f})$. Since this derivative is a sum of strictly positive terms, $G(\\widehat{\\Delta f})$ is a strictly increasing function of $\\widehat{\\Delta f}$. This property, along with the fact that $G(\\widehat{\\Delta f})$ asymptotes to $-N_{\\mathrm{B}}$ as $\\widehat{\\Delta f} \\to -\\infty$ and to $N_{\\mathrm{A}}$ as $\\widehat{\\Delta f} \\to +\\infty$, guarantees a unique root. This root will be found numerically using a robust algorithm, specifically the Brent-Dekker method (`brentq` from the SciPy library), which is efficient and reliable for a bracketed, monotonic function.\n\nFor each test case, the following steps are executed programmatically:\n1.  Set the random number generator seed.\n2.  Generate $N_{\\mathrm{A}}$ samples from $N(\\mu_{\\mathrm{A}}, 1/k_{\\mathrm{A}})$ and $N_{\\mathrm{B}}$ samples from $N(\\mu_{\\mathrm{B}}, 1/k_{\\mathrm{B}})$.\n3.  Compute the arrays of $\\Delta u_i$ and $\\Delta u'_j$.\n4.  Numerically solve $G(\\widehat{\\Delta f}) = 0$ for $\\widehat{\\Delta f}$.\n5.  Compute $\\Delta F_{\\mathrm{exact}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln(k_{\\mathrm{B}}/k_{\\mathrm{A}})$.\n6.  Calculate the bias $b = \\widehat{\\Delta f} - \\Delta F_{\\mathrm{exact}}$.\n7.
