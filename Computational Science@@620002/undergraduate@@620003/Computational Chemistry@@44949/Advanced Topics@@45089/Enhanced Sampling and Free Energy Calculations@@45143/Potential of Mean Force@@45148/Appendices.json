This problem presents a counterintuitive scenario: a PMF calculation that yields a negative activation barrier, where the transition state appears more stable than the reactant state. Rather than a simple error, this surprising outcome forces a deeper consideration of the physical and methodological underpinnings of the PMF, including the choice of reaction coordinate and the potential for projection-induced artifacts [@problem_id:2460690].", "problem": "A potential of mean force (PMF) calculation is performed for a conformational transition using umbrella sampling and the Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM). The PMF is reported as a function of a scalar reaction coordinate $\\xi$, and the apparent barrier height is defined as $\\Delta W^{\\ddagger} \\equiv W(\\xi^{\\ddagger}) - W(\\xi_{\\mathrm{A}})$, where $\\xi_{\\mathrm{A}}$ is the location of the reactant basin minimum and $\\xi^{\\ddagger}$ is the location of the highest-probability dividing surface identified along $\\xi$. Surprisingly, the analysis yields $\\Delta W^{\\ddagger} < 0$ and this feature appears robust across repeated runs.\n\nWhich three of the following are physically or methodologically plausible explanations for the observation $\\Delta W^{\\ddagger} < 0$? Select exactly three options.\n\nA. The reaction coordinate $\\xi$ is non-Cartesian (e.g., a distance or angle), and the analysis omitted the appropriate geometric (Jacobian/Fixman) correction when converting a constrained free energy or mean force to the PMF, introducing an extra entropic term that can lower $W(\\xi)$ at larger $|\\xi|$ and yield an apparently negative barrier.\n\nB. The umbrella sampling windows have poor overlap and insufficient sampling near $\\xi_{\\mathrm{A}}$, leading to an underestimated marginal probability at $\\xi_{\\mathrm{A}}$ and thus an artificially small or negative $\\Delta W^{\\ddagger}$ after WHAM reweighting.\n\nC. The chosen reaction coordinate $\\xi$ does not resolve the true bottleneck; many microstates project to $\\xi \\approx \\xi^{\\ddagger}$ while fewer project to $\\xi \\approx \\xi_{\\mathrm{A}}$, so the marginalization onto $\\xi$ yields $W(\\xi^{\\ddagger}) < W(\\xi_{\\mathrm{A}})$ even though the true transition in the full space is activated.\n\nD. Changing the arbitrary additive constant used to set the zero of $W(\\xi)$ can by itself change the sign of $\\Delta W^{\\ddagger}$, making a positive barrier appear negative.\n\nE. Quantum tunneling at the simulation temperature reduces the equilibrium PMF barrier below zero, so a negative $\\Delta W^{\\ddagger}$ is expected even with a correct classical PMF analysis.\n\nF. By definition, PMF barriers cannot be negative; therefore a negative $\\Delta W^{\\ddagger}$ necessarily implies a fundamental inconsistency and cannot arise from projection, entropy, or analysis choices.", "solution": "Begin from the definition of the potential of mean force (PMF) along a coordinate $\\xi$ at temperature $T$,\n$$\nW(\\xi) \\equiv -k_{\\mathrm{B}} T \\ln P(\\xi) + C,\n$$\nwhere $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $P(\\xi)$ is the equilibrium marginal probability density of observing the system at coordinate $\\xi$, and $C$ is an arbitrary additive constant. The barrier height defined in the problem is\n$$\n\\Delta W^{\\ddagger} \\equiv W(\\xi^{\\ddagger}) - W(\\xi_{\\mathrm{A}}).\n$$\nBecause $C$ cancels in differences, $\\Delta W^{\\ddagger}$ is determined by the ratio of probabilities,\n$$\n\\Delta W^{\\ddagger} = -k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\ln \\frac{P(\\xi^{\\ddagger})}{P(\\xi_{\\mathrm{A}})}.\n$$\nThus, $\\Delta W^{\\ddagger} < 0$ means $P(\\xi^{\\ddagger}) > P(\\xi_{\\mathrm{A}})$. This can occur for several physical or methodological reasons tied to how $P(\\xi)$ is constructed, how $\\xi$ is defined, and how reweighting is performed.\n\nAnalyze each option:\n\nA. The reaction coordinate $\\xi$ is non-Cartesian and the analysis omitted the appropriate geometric (Jacobian/Fixman) correction. Along curvilinear coordinates, the metric determinant (Jacobian) $J(\\xi)$ contributes an entropic term to the PMF. For example, for a radial distance coordinate $r$, the number of microstates grows as $4\\pi r^{2}$, and one finds $W(r) = -k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\ln P(r) = -k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\ln \\left[\\tilde{P}(r)\\, J(r)\\right] + C$, where $\\tilde{P}(r)$ is a probability defined per unit coordinate without the geometric factor and $J(r) \\propto r^{2}$. If the conversion from mean force or constrained free energy to $W(\\xi)$ omits the geometric (Fixman) term, the apparent $W(\\xi)$ can be spuriously lowered in regions of large $J(\\xi)$, potentially making $W(\\xi^{\\ddagger}) < W(\\xi_{\\mathrm{A}})$ and yielding $\\Delta W^{\\ddagger} < 0$. This is a well-known methodological pitfall and is therefore plausible. Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. Poor overlap and insufficient sampling near $\\xi_{\\mathrm{A}}$ can bias $P(\\xi_{\\mathrm{A}})$ downward. In umbrella sampling, the Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM) relies on sufficient overlap between biased windows and adequate sampling to reconstruct unbiased $P(\\xi)$. If windows around $\\xi_{\\mathrm{A}}$ are undersampled or underrepresented, WHAM may underestimate $P(\\xi_{\\mathrm{A}})$ relative to $P(\\xi^{\\ddagger})$, making $-k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\ln\\big(P(\\xi^{\\ddagger})/P(\\xi_{\\mathrm{A}})\\big)$ more negative and producing $\\Delta W^{\\ddagger} < 0$. This is a credible methodological explanation. Verdict: Correct.\n\nC. An inadequate reaction coordinate can remove the barrier upon projection. The PMF along $\\xi$ is a many-to-one projection of the full free energy landscape. If the true bottleneck resides in orthogonal degrees of freedom not encoded by $\\xi$, the marginal $P(\\xi)$ can be larger near $\\xi^{\\ddagger}$ simply because a large number of microstates project to that value of $\\xi$ (high degeneracy), while fewer project to $\\xi_{\\mathrm{A}}$. Then $W(\\xi)$ can be downhill along $\\xi$ and even yield $W(\\xi^{\\ddagger}) < W(\\xi_{\\mathrm{A}})$. This is a physical explanation rooted in entropy and projection: the barrier can disappear or invert when viewed in an inadequate coordinate. Verdict: Correct.\n\nD. Changing the additive constant in $W(\\xi)$ cannot change $\\Delta W^{\\ddagger}$. From the expression $\\Delta W^{\\ddagger} = W(\\xi^{\\ddagger}) - W(\\xi_{\\mathrm{A}})$, any constant shift $C$ cancels. Therefore, choosing a different zero of free energy cannot change the sign of the barrier. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nE. Quantum tunneling affects kinetics rather than the equilibrium PMF obtained from classical sampling and reweighting. In standard classical PMF calculations, nuclear quantum effects are not included, so tunneling cannot explain a negative $\\Delta W^{\\ddagger}$. Even when nuclear quantum effects are included via, for example, path-integral methods, the PMF remains an equilibrium free energy profile determined by partition functions; tunneling does not generically drive the activation free energy below zero. The statement that tunneling “reduces the equilibrium PMF barrier below zero” is not a general or appropriate explanation here. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nF. There is no fundamental prohibition against a negative $\\Delta W^{\\ddagger}$ as defined; the PMF is defined up to an additive constant, and its shape along a chosen $\\xi$ can, in principle, place $W(\\xi^{\\ddagger})$ below $W(\\xi_{\\mathrm{A}})$ if the projection and entropic factors favor $\\xi^{\\ddagger}$, or if analysis errors distort $P(\\xi)$. Therefore, asserting impossibility “by definition” is false. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the three plausible explanations are options A, B, and C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "2460690"}]}
