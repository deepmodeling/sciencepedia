Consider a chain of $N$ carbon atoms with one $p_{z}$ orbital per site and nearest-neighbor interactions only.

It presents a standard problem in computational quantum chemistry based on the Hückel Molecular Orbital (HMO) model. All parameters and conditions are clearly defined, allowing for a unique and verifiable solution. Therefore, a solution is warranted.\n\nThe task is to compute the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) to Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) energy gap, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{HL}}$, for a linear polyene chain of $N=8$ carbon atoms. The system is described by the HMO model, where a real symmetric tridiagonal Hamiltonian matrix, $H$, defines the electronic structure.\n\nThe solution to the time-independent Schrödinger equation in the Hückel approximation is given by the eigenvalue problem:\n$$\nH \\mathbf{c} = E \\mathbf{c}\n$$\nHere, $H$ is the $N \\times N$ Hamiltonian matrix, $E$ are the molecular orbital energy eigenvalues, and $\\mathbf{c}$ are the corresponding eigenvectors representing the molecular orbital coefficients.\n\nThe Hamiltonian matrix $H$ is constructed based on the following rules:\n1.  The on-site energies (Coulomb integrals) are the diagonal elements, $H_{ii} = \\alpha$. The problem specifies $\\alpha=0$.\n2.  The nearest-neighbor interaction energies (resonance integrals) are the off-diagonal elements, $H_{i,i+1} = H_{i+1,i}$.

Its energy is $E_{\\mathrm{HOMO}} = E_4$.\nThe Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) is the 5th orbital. Its energy is $E_{\\mathrm{LUMO}} = E_5$.\n\nThe HOMO-LUMO gap is then calculated as the difference between these two energy levels:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\mathrm{HL}} = E_{\\mathrm{LUMO}} - E_{\\mathrm{HOMO}} = E_5 - E_4\n$$\nSince the calculations are performed with $\\beta = -1$, the resulting energies and energy gap are already in units of $|\\beta|$, as required.\n\nThe computational procedure for each test case is as follows:\n1.

Numerically compute the eigenvalues of the real symmetric matrix $H$. Standard numerical algebra libraries provide efficient and stable algorithms for this, which also return the eigenvalues in sorted order.\n4.  Identify the 4th eigenvalue (at index $3$ in a $0$-indexed array) as $E_{\\mathrm{HOMO}}$ and the 5th eigenvalue (at index $4$) as $E_{\\mathrm{LUMO}}$.\n5.

A solution will be provided.\n\n**Methodology and Solution**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in solving the time-independent Schrödinger equation, $\\hat{H}\\,|\\psi\\rangle = E\\,|\\psi\\rangle$, within the provided LCAO-Hückel framework.\n\n1.  **From Schrödinger Equation to Matrix Eigendecomposition:**\n    The LCAO ansatz, $|\\psi_k\\rangle = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} c_{jk} |\\chi_j\\rangle$, is substituted into the Schrödinger equation. By left-multiplying with a basis function $\\langle\\chi_i|$ and integrating over all space, we obtain a set of secular equations for each molecular orbital $k$:\n    $$ \\sum_{j=1}^{3} c_{jk} (\\langle\\chi_i|\\hat{H}|\\chi_j\\rangle - E_k \\langle\\chi_i|\\chi_j\\rangle) = 0 $$\n    Using the Hückel definitions $H_{ij} = \\langle\\chi_i|\\hat{H}|\\chi_j\\rangle$ and the orthonormal basis condition $S_{ij} = \\langle\\chi_i|\\chi_j\\rangle = \\delta_{ij}$, this system of equations for a given orbital (dropping the index $k$) simplifies to the matrix eigenvalue equation:\n    $$ H\\mathbf{c} = E\\mathbf{c} $$\n    where $\\mathbf{c} = (c_A, c_B, c_C)^T$ is the vector of LCAO coefficients.\n\n2.  **Hamiltonian Construction:**\n    For the linear A–B–C system, non-zero interactions are only between A-B and B-C. The Hamiltonian matrix is thus a $3 \\times 3$ real symmetric matrix:\n    $$\n    H = \\begin{pmatrix}\n    H_{AA}  H_{AB}  H_{AC} \\\\\n    H_{BA}  H_{BB}  H_{BC} \\\\\n    H_{CA}  H_{CB}  H_{CC}\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    =\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    \\alpha_A  \\beta_{AB}  0 \\\\\n    \\beta_{AB}  \\alpha_B  \\beta_{BC} \\\\\n    0  \\beta_{BC}  \\alpha_C\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    This matrix is constructed for each given parameter set.\n\n3.  **Solving the Eigenproblem:**\n    The diagonalization of this matrix $H$ yields three real eigenvalues $E_1 \\le E_2 \\le E_3$ and their corresponding orthonormal eigenvectors $\\mathbf{c}^{(1)}, \\mathbf{c}^{(2)}, \\mathbf{c}^{(3)}$. Standard numerical linear algebra libraries, such as NumPy's `linalg.eigh`, are designed for this task and are guaranteed to return sorted eigenvalues for a symmetric matrix.\n\n4.  **Orbital Identification and Analysis:**\n    With $N_e=4$ electrons, the aufbau principle dictates that the first two molecular orbitals, with energies $E_1$ and $E_2$, are each occupied by two electrons.\n    - The HOMO is the orbital associated with $E_2$. Its coefficient vector is $\\mathbf{c}^{(\\mathrm{HOMO})} = \\mathbf{c}^{(2)}$.\n    - The LUMO is the orbital associated with $E_3$. Its coefficient vector is $\\mathbf{c}^{(\\mathrm{LUMO})} = \\mathbf{c}^{(3)}$.\n    The composition of these orbitals is determined by the squares of the coefficients in their respective eigenvectors. For a given eigenvector $\\mathbf{c} = (c_A, c_B, c_C)^T$, the quantity $|c_i|^2$ (or $c_i^2$ since they are real) represents the probability of finding an electron in the atomic orbital $|\\chi_i\\rangle$, effectively the \"character\" of the orbital on atom $i$.\n\n5.  **Algorithmic Verification:**\n    For each test case, the following procedure is executed:\n    a. Construct the $3 \\times 3$ NumPy array representing the Hamiltonian $H$ from the input parameters.\n    b. Use `numpy.linalg.eigh` to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. This function conveniently returns the eigenvalues in ascending order and the corresponding eigenvectors as columns of a matrix.\n    c. Extract the HOMO eigenvector (the second column of the eigenvector matrix) and the LUMO eigenvector (the third column).\n    d. For the HOMO eigenvector $\\mathbf{c}^{(\\mathrm{HOMO})}$, evaluate the boolean condition: `(c_A**2 >= 0.98) and (c_B**2 = 0.01) and (c_C**2 = 0.01)`.\n    e. For the LUMO eigenvector $\\mathbf{c}^{(\\mathrm{LUMO})}$, evaluate the three conditions:\n        - `d_A**2 = 0.02`\n        - `d_B * d_C  0`\n        - `abs(abs(d_B) - abs(d_C)) / max(abs(d_B), abs(d_C)) = 0.10` (with care for the edge case of a zero denominator, which does not occur here).\n    f. The final result for the test case is `True` if and only if both the HOMO and LUMO criteria are met. This boolean result is stored.\n    g. After processing all test cases, the list of boolean results is formatted into the specified string format. The ambiguity in the problem description regarding boolean capitalization (`True`/`False` vs. `true`/`false`) is resolved by adhering to the provided output example `[true,false,true,false]`, which necessitates converting the Python booleans to lowercase strings.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the molecular orbital analysis problem for a linear three-center system\n    using the Hückel tight-binding model.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Each test case is a 5-tuple: (alpha_A, alpha_B, alpha_C, beta_AB, beta_BC) in eV.\n    test_cases = [\n        (0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, -1.0),       # Test 1 (happy path)\n        (-2.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, -1.0),      # Test 2 (HOMO not on A)\n        (-0.5, 0.5, 0.5, -0.01, -1.0),    # Test 3 (near-degeneracy and mixing)\n        (0.8, 0.5, 2.0, 0.0, -0.5),       # Test 4 (LUMO not symmetric pi*)\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n\n    for params in test_cases:\n        alpha_A, alpha_B, alpha_C, beta_AB, beta_BC = params\n\n        # 1.
