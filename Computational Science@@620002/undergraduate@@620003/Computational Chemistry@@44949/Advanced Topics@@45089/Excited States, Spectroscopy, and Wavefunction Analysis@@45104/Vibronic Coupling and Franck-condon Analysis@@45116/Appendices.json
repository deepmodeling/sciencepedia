The system is modeled as a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator.\n\nThe problem statement provides a set of simplifying, but standard, assumptions: the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, the Condon approximation, and identical harmonic frequencies ($\\omega' = \\omega$) for the two electronic states. The only structural difference between the two potential energy surfaces is a geometric displacement, $\\Delta Q$, along the normal coordinate. This displacement is quantified by the dimensionless Huang–Rhys factor, $S = \\frac{m \\omega \\Delta Q^2}{2 \\hbar}$.\n\nThe Franck–Condon factor for the transition $\\lvert 0 \\rangle \\to \\lvert v' \\rangle$ is defined by the squared modulus of the overlap integral between the initial and final vibrational wavefunctions:\n$$F_{v'} = \\lvert \\langle v' \\lvert 0 \\rangle \\rvert^2$$\nHere, $\\lvert 0 \\rangle$ is the ground state eigenfunction of the lower-state (undisplaced) harmonic oscillator, and $\\lvert v' \\rangle$ is the $v'$-th eigenfunction of the upper-state (displaced) harmonic oscillator.\n\nTo evaluate this overlap integral, we employ the operator formalism of quantum mechanics. Let the annihilation and creation operators for the lower-state oscillator be $a$ and $a^\\dagger$, respectively. The position operator is $\\hat{Q} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{2m\\omega}}(a + a^\\dagger)$. The upper-state potential is centered at $Q = \\Delta Q$. Its eigenstates, $\\lvert v' \\rangle$, are therefore displaced versions of the lower-state eigenstates, $\\lvert v \\rangle$. This spatial displacement is generated by the displacement operator, $D(\\alpha)$, where $\\alpha$ is a dimensionless parameter.\nThe relationship between the state vectors is $\\lvert v' \\rangle = D(\\alpha) \\lvert v' \\rangle_0$, where $\\lvert v' \\rangle_0$ denotes the eigenstate of the undisplaced Hamiltonian with quantum number $v'$. The displacement operator is given by:\n$$D(\\alpha) = \\exp(\\alpha a^\\dagger - \\alpha^* a)$$\nThe displacement parameter $\\alpha$ is related to the physical displacement $\\Delta Q$ by $\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\frac{m\\omega}{2\\hbar}}\\Delta Q$.

The statement specifies \"displaced harmonic potentials with the same curvature (force constant)\". A literal interpretation implies that the force constant $k$ is identical for the lower ($''$) and upper ($'$) electronic states, i.e., $k''=k'$. If this were true, the vibrational frequencies for a given isotope, $\\omega'' = \\sqrt{k''/\\mu}$ and $\\omega' = \\sqrt{k'/\\mu}$, would be identical. Consequently, the difference in zero-point vibrational energies (ZPVE) would be zero: $E_0' - E_0'' = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega' - \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega'' = 0$. This would mean the band origin $E_{00} = T_e + E_0' - E_0''$ is always equal to the purely electronic energy $T_e$, regardless of the isotopic mass $\\mu$. The distance between $E_{00}$ and $T_e$ would be zero and thus could not \"move closer\" or \"shift farther away\". This contradicts the premises of options A, B, and D. Option C correctly claims $E_{00}$ is unchanged but fails on other points. Therefore, a strictly literal reading renders the problem ill-posed with respect to the provided options.\n\nA more reasonable, or \"charitable\", interpretation is that the author intended to specify that each potential is harmonic (i.e., has a constant curvature) but that the force constants of the two electronic states may differ, $k' \\neq k''$. This is the physically realistic scenario, as electronic excitation typically alters the bonding characteristics of a molecule. This interpretation aligns with the structure of the options, which presuppose a non-zero, mass-dependent ZPVE correction. I will proceed under this assumption ($k' \\neq k''$) to derive a meaningful solution.\n\nLet us analyze the three effects of the isotopic substitution $\\mathrm{H}_2 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{D}_2$, where the reduced mass increases: $\\mu_{\\mathrm{D}_2} \\approx 2\\mu_{\\mathrm{H}_2}$.\n\n1.  **Vibronic Line Spacings**:\n    The vibronic transitions in an absorption spectrum reflect the vibrational energy levels of the *upper* electronic state. For a harmonic oscillator, the energy of the $v'$-th level is $E_{v'} = (v' + 1/2)\\hbar\\omega'$, where $\\omega' = \\sqrt{k'/\\mu}$ is the vibrational angular frequency. The spacing between adjacent vibronic lines is the energy difference between adjacent vibrational levels in the upper state:\n    $$ \\Delta E' = E_{v'+1} - E_{v'} = \\hbar\\omega' = \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k'}{\\mu}} $$\n    Since the force constant $k'$ is independent of isotopic mass (within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation), the spacing is inversely proportional to the square root of the reduced mass: $\\Delta E' \\propto \\mu^{-1/2}$. Upon substituting $\\mathrm{H}_2$ with $\\mathrm{D}_2$, $\\mu$ increases. Therefore, the vibrational frequency $\\omega'$ decreases, and the vibronic line spacings **decrease**.\n\n2.  **Franck-Condon (FC) Intensity Distribution**:\n    The FC principle states that the intensity of a vibronic transition is proportional to the squared overlap of the initial and final vibrational wavefunctions. We consider transitions from the ground vibrational level ($v''=0$) of the lower electronic state. According to the semi-classical picture, the vertical transition from the equilibrium position ($R_e''$) of the initial state projects onto the potential energy curve of the final state. The most probable final vibrational level, $v'_{\\text{max}}$, is the one whose energy is closest to this vertical excitation energy.\n    The energy deposited into vibration in the upper state is approximately $\\Delta V = V'(R_e'') - V'(R_e')$. Since the upper state potential is harmonic, $V'(R) = V'(R_e') + \\frac{1}{2}k'(R - R_e')^2$, and the displacement is $d = R_e' - R_e''$, this energy is $\\Delta V = \\frac{1}{2}k'd^2$.\n    The energy of the most intense transition is approximately $v'_{\\text{max}} \\hbar \\omega'$. Equating these gives:\n    $$ v'_{\\text{max}} \\hbar \\omega' \\approx \\frac{1}{2}k'd^2 $$\n    $$ v'_{\\text{max}} \\approx \\frac{k'd^2}{2\\hbar\\omega'} = \\frac{k'd^2}{2\\hbar\\sqrt{k'/\\mu}} = \\frac{d^2 \\sqrt{k'\\mu}}{2\\hbar} $$\n    This quantity is the Huang-Rhys factor, $S$. It shows that the most probable vibrational quantum number for the transition is proportional to the square root of the reduced mass: $v'_{\\text{max}} \\propto \\sqrt{\\mu}$. As $\\mu$ increases from $\\mathrm{H}_2$ to $\\mathrm{D}_2$, $v'_{\\text{max}}$ increases. This means the Franck-Condon intensity envelope **shifts toward higher vibrational quanta $v'$**. Consequently, the relative intensity of the $0-0$ band, which is given by $I_{00} \\propto \\exp(-S)$, must **decrease** as $S$ increases.\n\n3.  **Band Origin ($E_{00}$)**:\n    The band origin is the energy of the $0-0$ transition, given by:\n    $$ E_{00} = T_e + E_0' - E_0'' = T_e + \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega' - \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega'' $$\n    Substituting the expressions for the frequencies:\n    $$ E_{00} = T_e + \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k'}{\\mu}} - \\sqrt{\\frac{k''}{\\mu}}\\right) = T_e + \\frac{\\hbar}{2\\sqrt{\\mu}}(\\sqrt{k'} - \\sqrt{k''}) $$\n    The shift of the band origin from the purely electronic energy $T_e$ is $\\Delta E_{\\text{ZPVE}} = E_{00} - T_e = \\frac{\\hbar(\\sqrt{k'} - \\sqrt{k''})}{2\\sqrt{\\mu}}$. The magnitude of this shift is proportional to $\\mu^{-1/2}$. As the reduced mass $\\mu$ increases, the magnitude of the ZPVE correction, $|\\Delta E_{\\text{ZPVE}}|$, decreases. Therefore, the band origin $E_{00}$ **moves closer** to the purely electronic energy $T_e$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**:\n\n*   **A. Vibronic line spacings increase, FC intensity concentrates more strongly in the $0-0$ band, and the band origin $E_{00}$ shifts farther away from the purely electronic energy $T_e$.**\n    - Vibronic line spacings: **Incorrect**. They decrease.\n    - FC intensity: **Incorrect**. It shifts to higher $v'$, and the $0-0$ band becomes weaker.\n    - Band origin: **Incorrect**. It moves closer to $T_e$.\n\n*   **B. Vibronic line spacings decrease, the FC intensity distribution shifts toward higher $v'$ quanta with a weaker $0-0$ band, and the band origin $E_{00}$ moves closer to the purely electronic energy $T_e$.**\n    - Vibronic line spacings: **Correct**.\n    - FC intensity: **Correct**.\n    - Band origin: **Correct**.\n\n*   **C. Vibronic line spacings are unchanged, FC factors are unchanged because they depend only on geometry, and the band origin $E_{00}$ is unchanged.**\n    - Vibronic line spacings: **Incorrect**. They depend on mass and decrease.\n    - FC factors: **Incorrect**. They depend on mass through the vibrational wavefunctions.\n    - Band origin: **Incorrect** (under the necessary interpretation $k' \\ne k''$).\n\n*   **D. Vibronic line spacings decrease, FC intensity concentrates more strongly in the $0-0$ band, and the band origin $E_{00}$ moves closer to the purely electronic energy $T_e$.**\n    - Vibronic line spacings: **Correct**.\n    - FC intensity: **Incorrect**. It shifts to higher $v'$, away from the $0-0$ band.\n    - Band origin: **Correct**.\n\nBased on a complete analysis under the only physically sensible interpretation of the problem that allows for a solution among the options, option B is the only one where all claims are correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2467031"}]}
