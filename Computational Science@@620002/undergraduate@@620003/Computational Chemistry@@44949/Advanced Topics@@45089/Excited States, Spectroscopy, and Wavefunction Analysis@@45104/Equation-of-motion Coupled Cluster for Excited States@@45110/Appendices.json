In this limit, the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian, $\\bar{H} = \\exp(-T) H \\exp(T)$, simplifies to the bare Hamiltonian, $H$. We are tasked with finding the matrix representation of this Hamiltonian in the basis of singly excited spin-orbital determinants relative to the Restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) ground state determinant $|\\Phi_0\\rangle$.\n\nThe RHF reference state is $|\\Phi_0\\rangle = |o\\alpha \\, o\\beta \\rangle$, where $o$ is the occupied bonding spatial molecular orbital. The basis for the singly excited states is given as $\\{|\\Psi_1\\rangle, |\\Psi_2\\rangle\\}$, where:\n$$ |\\Psi_1\\rangle = a_{v\\alpha}^{\\dagger} a_{o\\alpha} |\\Phi_0\\rangle \\equiv |\\Phi_{o\\alpha}^{v\\alpha}\\rangle $$\n$$ |\\Psi_2\\rangle = a_{v\\beta}^{\\dagger} a_{o\\beta} |\\Phi_0\\rangle \\equiv |\\Phi_{o\\beta}^{v\\beta}\\rangle $$\nHere, $v$ denotes the virtual antibonding spatial molecular orbital, and $a_{p\\sigma}^\\dagger$ and $a_{q\\sigma}$ are the creation and annihilation operators for an electron in spin-orbital $p\\sigma$ and $q\\sigma$, respectively.\n\nThe matrix to be constructed is $\\bar{H}$, with elements $\\bar{H}_{mn} = \\langle \\Psi_m | H | \\Psi_n \\rangle$. It is standard to work with the Hamiltonian shifted by the ground state energy $E_0 = \\langle \\Phi_0 | H | \\Phi_0 \\rangle$, as the eigenvalues will then directly yield the excitation energies. The elements of this shifted matrix, which we will also denote by $\\bar{H}$, are given by $\\bar{H}_{mn} = \\langle \\Psi_m | H - E_0 | \\Psi_n \\rangle$.\n\nThe general expression for a matrix element of the shifted Hamiltonian between two singly excited determinants, $|\\Phi_i^a\\rangle$ and $|\\Phi_j^b\\rangle$, where $i,j$ are occupied spin-orbitals and $a,b$ are virtual spin-orbitals, is given by the Slater-Condon rules.

Thus, the matrix element is:\n$$ \\bar{H}_{12} = K - 0 = K $$\n\n**Off-Diagonal Element $\\bar{H}_{21}$:**\nSince the Hamiltonian is Hermitian, $\\bar{H}_{21} = \\bar{H}_{12}^*$. As all quantities ($\\Delta\\varepsilon, J, K$) are real, we have $\\bar{H}_{21} = \\bar{H}_{12} = K$.\nWe can verify this by explicit calculation with $i=o\\beta, j=o\\alpha, a=v\\beta, b=v\\alpha$.\n$$ \\bar{H}_{21} = \\langle (v\\beta)(o\\alpha) || (o\\beta)(v\\alpha) \\rangle = \\langle (v\\beta)(o\\alpha) | (o\\beta)(v\\alpha) \\rangle - \\langle (v\\beta)(o\\alpha) | (v\\alpha)(o\\beta) \\rangle $$\n$$ \\langle (v\\beta)(o\\alpha) | (o\\beta)(v\\alpha) \\rangle = (vo \\mid ov) \\langle\\beta|\\beta\\rangle \\langle\\alpha|\\alpha\\rangle = K $$\n$$ \\langle (v\\beta)(o\\alpha) | (v\\alpha)(o\\beta) \\rangle = (vv \\mid oo) \\langle\\beta|\\alpha\\rangle \\langle\\alpha|\\beta\\rangle = 0 $$\nThis confirms $\\bar{H}_{21} = K$.\n\nAssembling these elements gives the final $2 \\times 2$ EOM-CIS effective Hamiltonian matrix $\\bar{H}$:\n$$ \\bar{H} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\Delta\\varepsilon + K - J & K \\\\ K & \\Delta\\varepsilon + K - J \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe eigenvalues of this matrix are $\\lambda_1 = \\Delta\\varepsilon - J$ (corresponding to the triplet state) and $\\lambda_2 = \\Delta\\varepsilon + 2K - J$ (corresponding to the singlet state), which are the correct CIS excitation energies for this model system.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\Delta \\varepsilon + K - J & K \\\\\nK & \\Delta \\varepsilon + K - J\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2455511"}, {"introduction": "Having built a simple matrix by hand, we now bridge the gap to practical computation by modeling a family of chemically important systems.

This determinant is typically obtained from an RHF calculation. In this picture, the bonding molecular orbital $\\sigma_g$ is doubly occupied, and the antibonding orbital $\\sigma_u^*$ is empty. The energy gap between these orbitals is large.\n\n2.  **During Bond Dissociation:** As the internuclear distance $R$ increases, the molecule is pulled apart into two fluorine atoms: $F_2 \\to F + F$. Each ground-state fluorine atom has an open-shell electronic configuration ($[He] 2s^2 2p^5$), possessing one unpaired electron. The correct description of two interacting open-shell atoms requires a wavefunction that can represent a pure singlet state formed from these two unpaired electrons.\n\n3.  **Breakdown of the RHF Reference:** The RHF method is fundamentally incapable of correctly describing this dissociation process. The RHF wavefunction, $|\\Phi_0\\rangle$, by construction, enforces double occupancy of molecular orbitals. As $R \\to \\infty$, the RHF wavefunction for $F_2$ becomes an equal-weight superposition of the correct covalent configuration ($F \\cdot + \\cdot F$) and an incorrect, high-energy ionic configuration ($F^+ F^-$). This leads to a catastrophic failure: the RHF potential energy curve rises to a completely unphysical energy at the dissociation limit.\n\n4.  **Static Correlation:** The energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO, $\\sigma_g$) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO, $\\sigma_u^*$) diminishes as $R \\to \\infty$. At the dissociation limit, the $\\sigma_g$ and $\\sigma_u^*$ orbitals become degenerate. The ground state wavefunction $|\\Psi_{\\text{GS}}\\rangle$ develops a strong multi-reference character, meaning it can only be correctly described by a linear combination of multiple determinants. A minimal correct description requires at least two determinants: $$|\\Psi_{\\text{GS}}\\rangle \\approx c_1 |\\dots (\\sigma_g)^2\\rangle + c_2 |\\dots (\\sigma_u^*)^2\\rangle$$ As $R \\to \\infty$, the coefficients become equal in magnitude, $|c_1| \\approx |c_2|$. This requirement to include multiple, near-degenerate determinants in the zeroth-order wavefunction is known as **strong** or **static (nondynamic) correlation**.\n\n5.  **Failure of EOM-CCSD:** The EOM-CCSD method is built upon a single-reference coupled-cluster ground state, $$|\\Psi_{\\text{CCSD}}\\rangle = \\exp(\\hat{T}_1 + \\hat{T}_2) |\\Phi_0\\rangle$$\n    - The ground-state CCSD calculation itself fails for the same reason the RHF reference fails. Although the exponential ansatz $\\exp(\\hat{T})$ can capture some static correlation by including excited determinants (like the crucial double excitation from $\\sigma_g$ to $\\sigma_u^*$) to infinite order, it cannot overcome the qualitative failure of a poor starting reference $|\\Phi_0\\rangle$.\n    - The EOM part of the calculation, $|\\Psi_K\\rangle = \\hat{R}_K \\exp(\\hat{T}) |\\Phi_0\\rangle$, seeks other electronic states by applying a linear excitation operator $\\hat{R}_K$ to this flawed reference state. The space of states accessible by applying single and double excitation operators ($\\hat{R}_1, \\hat{R}_2$) to a single, fundamentally incorrect reference $|\\Phi_0\\rangle$ is not sufficiently flexible to describe the true multi-reference nature of the electronic states at large $R$. The method attempts to describe states that are inherently composed of two or more dominant configurations using an operator designed for states dominated by single excitations from a single-configuration reference. This leads to an unphysical description of the potential energy surfaces, often with artificial humps or incorrect ordering of states.\n\nIn summary, the failure is a direct consequence of using a single-reference method (EOM-CCSD) based on a single-determinant reference (RHF) for a problem that is intrinsically multi-reference in nature due to strong static correlation.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. The dissociation of $F_2$ exhibits strong static (nondynamic) correlation and near-degeneracy; the exact dissociation limit is dominated by multiple determinants corresponding to two open-shell fluorine atoms, so a single-determinant RHF reference and the EOM-CCSD operator manifold cannot capture the required multi-reference character across bond breaking.**\n    This statement accurately and comprehensively identifies all the key aspects of the problem: the presence of strong static correlation, the multi-determinantal nature of the dissociation limit, the inadequacy of the single-determinant RHF reference, and the subsequent failure of the EOM-CCSD framework which is built upon that reference.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. EOM-CCSD is not size-consistent, so it necessarily gives incorrect dissociation limits even for systems without significant near-degeneracy.**\n    This statement is incorrect. EOM-CCSD for excitation energies is a size-consistent method. Its failure in the case of $F_2$ dissociation is not due to a general lack of size-consistency but due to the specific multi-reference character of this system. For bond-breaking processes where a single-reference description remains valid (e.g., $HeH^+ \\to He + H^+$), EOM-CCSD can perform adequately.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Basis set incompleteness error dominates for $F_2$, and correlated methods like EOM-CCSD cannot remedy this without extremely large one-electron bases; the failure is primarily a basis-set artifact rather than a correlation problem.**\n    While basis set incompleteness is a source of quantitative error, the problem described is a *qualitative* failure in the shape of the potential energy curve. This qualitative failure persists even when using very large basis sets. The root cause is the inability of the method to handle the N-electron static correlation effect, which is distinct from the one-electron basis set problem. Therefore, attributing the primary failure to basis sets is incorrect.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. The failure is solely due to neglect of triple excitations; bond breaking universally requires triple excitations even when a single-reference picture remains valid.**\n    This statement is flawed for two reasons. First, the use of \"solely\" is too strong. The fundamental problem is the breakdown of the single-reference picture, which is more primary than the truncation level of the cluster operator. While including triple excitations (e.g., in EOM-CCSDT) does improve the description of bond-stretching by providing more flexibility to describe static correlation, it does not change the single-reference nature of the method's foundation. Second, the claim that bond breaking \"universally requires triple excitations\" is false. Systems that dissociate into closed-shell fragments can be described well at the CCSD level. The need for higher excitations is dictated by the electronic structure, not by the bond-breaking process in general.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. The failure is solely due to lack of orbital relaxation; reoptimizing the same RHF orbitals $|\\Phi_0\\rangle$ at each $R$ would fix the problem within EOM-CCSD.**\n    A standard potential energy surface calculation already involves re-optimizing the RHF orbitals at each geometry point $R$. The problem is not the lack of optimization; the problem is that the optimal RHF solution itself is qualitatively wrong at large $R$ due to the constraint of being a single determinant. No amount of re-optimization within the RHF framework can produce a wavefunction that correctly describes two separate, neutral fluorine atoms. Orbital relaxation effects are also partially accounted for in coupled-cluster theory via the $\\hat{T}_1$ operator, but this is insufficient to cure the fundamental flaw of the zeroth-order reference.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2455482"}]}
