The state with $n=2$ and $j=3/2$ is the $2p_{3/2}$ state, which has $\\ell=1$.\n$$E_{2,3/2}^{\\mathrm{D}} = mc^2 \\left[ 1 - \\frac{\\alpha^2}{2(2)^2} - \\frac{\\alpha^4}{2(2)^4}\\left(\\frac{2}{3/2+1/2} - \\frac{3}{4}\\right) \\right]$$\n$$E_{2,3/2}^{\\mathrm{D}} = mc^2 \\left[ 1 - \\frac{\\alpha^2}{8} - \\frac{\\alpha^4}{32}\\left(\\frac{2}{2} - \\frac{3}{4}\\right) \\right]$$\n$$E_{2,3/2}^{\\mathrm{D}} = mc^2 \\left[ 1 - \\frac{\\alpha^2}{8} - \\frac{\\alpha^4}{32}\\left(1 - \\frac{3}{4}\\right) \\right] = mc^2 \\left[ 1 - \\frac{\\alpha^2}{8} - \\frac{\\alpha^4}{32}\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\right]$$\n$$E_{2,3/2}^{\\mathrm{D}} = mc^2 \\left[ 1 - \\frac{\\alpha^2}{8} - \\frac{\\alpha^4}{128} \\right]$$\nNow, we compute the difference $\\Delta E$.

First, consider the free-particle case, where $V(\\mathbf{r}) = 0$. The Hamiltonian is $\\hat H_{\\mathrm D}^{(0)} = c\\,\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf p} + \\beta\\, m c^2$. Its plane-wave eigenstates have energies $E_p = \\pm \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2}$. The energy spectrum is composed of two continua: a positive-energy continuum for $E \\ge +mc^2$ and a negative-energy continuum for $E \\le -mc^2$. Crucially, the spectrum is unbounded from below.\n\nThe Rayleigh–Ritz variational principle states that for a trial state $\\lvert \\Psi \\rangle$, the expectation value $E[\\Psi] = \\langle \\Psi \\lvert \\hat H \\rvert \\Psi \\rangle / \\langle \\Psi \\vert \\Psi \\rangle$ provides an upper bound to the true ground-state energy $E_0$, i.e., $E[\\Psi] \\ge E_0$. This principle is only valid if the Hamiltonian $\\hat H$ is bounded from below.\n\nIn our case, the Dirac Hamiltonian $\\hat H_{\\mathrm D}$ (both with and without a typical potential $V(\\mathbf{r})$ that is bounded relative to the kinetic energy) is *not* bounded from below due to the negative-energy continuum. Consequently, a naive application of the Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle is ill-fated. One can always construct a trial function $\\lvert \\Psi \\rangle$ by mixing in components from the negative-energy continuum eigenstates, which can lower the expectation value $E[\\Psi]$ without limit. The minimization procedure would not converge to the lowest *electronic* state (with energy slightly below $+mc^2$) but would \"collapse\" towards $-\\infty$.\n\nIn a finite basis set calculation, the basis functions can be used to construct approximations to both positive- and negative-energy states. The kinetic energy term, $c\\,\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf p}$, couples the large and small components of the $4$-spinor. An unbalanced basis for the large and small components can lead to a misrepresentation of this coupling, creating spurious states with large, negative energies. This failure of the variational principle in a finite basis is known as variational collapse.\n\nTo restore the validity of the variational principle, one must prevent the trial function from accessing the negative-energy part of the spectrum. This is achieved by restricting the variational search to the positive-energy subspace. The formal tool for this restriction is a projection operator $P_+$ that projects onto the subspace of positive-energy eigenstates of a suitable reference Hamiltonian. The variational problem is then reformulated either by searching over projected states $\\lvert \\Psi \\rangle = P_+ \\lvert \\Phi \\rangle$, leading to the minimization of a projected energy functional, or by working with a projected \"no-pair\" Hamiltonian $\\hat H_{\\mathrm{np}} = P_+ \\hat H_{\\mathrm D} P_+$. This projected Hamiltonian, when acting on the positive-energy subspace, is bounded from below, and the variational principle is restored.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Because the spectrum of $\\hat H_{\\mathrm D}$ contains a negative-energy continuum, the naive Rayleigh–Ritz minimization can lower $E[\\Psi]$ without bound by admixing negative-energy character into $\\lvert \\Psi \\rangle$. Constraining the trial space with the positive-energy projector $P_+$ so that $\\lvert \\Psi \\rangle = P_+ \\lvert \\Phi \\rangle$ and minimizing $\\langle \\Phi \\lvert P_+ \\hat H_{\\mathrm D} P_+ \\rvert \\Phi \\rangle / \\langle \\Phi \\lvert P_+ \\rvert \\Phi \\rangle$ removes coupling to the negative-energy sector and restores a lower bound.**\n\nThis statement is a precise and complete explanation of the fundamental issue. It correctly identifies the unbounded-from-below spectrum of $\\hat H_{\\mathrm D}$ as the root cause. It correctly describes the mechanism of collapse as admixture of negative-energy states. Finally, it correctly outlines the formal solution: using a positive-energy projector $P_+$ to define a variationally stable problem. The given functional $\\langle \\Phi \\lvert P_+ \\hat H_{\\mathrm D} P_+ \\rvert \\Phi \\rangle / \\langle \\Phi \\lvert P_+ \\rvert \\Phi \\rangle$ is the correct form for the energy expectation value of a state constrained to the projected subspace.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. For any local scalar potential $V(\\mathbf r)$, the Dirac Hamiltonian $\\hat H_{\\mathrm D}$ is bounded from below, so Rayleigh–Ritz is safe and no projection is required; variational collapse is an artifact that disappears in the continuum limit of the basis.**\n\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. The Dirac Hamiltonian is *not* bounded from below, even in the presence of a potential like the Coulomb potential. The negative-energy continuum persists. Therefore, the Rayleigh-Ritz method is *not* safe. The final claim that collapse is an artifact that disappears in the continuum (complete basis) limit is the opposite of the truth; the problem becomes more severe, as the energy can be driven to $-\\infty$, whereas in a finite basis it only collapses to a large negative value determined by the basis limitations.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Projecting onto the large-component block only, via $P_{\\mathrm L} = \\mathrm{diag}(1,1,0,0)$ in the standard representation, always yields correct relativistic energies because the small component does not contribute significantly to the energy functional.**\n\nThis statement describes a crude and incorrect approach. The small component, $\\Psi_{\\mathrm{S}}$, is related to the large component, $\\Psi_{\\mathrm{L}}$, via the Dirac equation. A key relationship for preventing variational collapse is ensuring that the basis for $\\Psi_{\\mathrm{S}}$ can accurately represent $(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{p}})\\Psi_{\\mathrm{L}}$, a condition known as kinetic balance. Simply discarding the small component by projecting with $P_{\\mathrm{L}}$ eliminates crucial relativistic effects, most notably spin-orbit coupling, which arises from the interplay between the large and small components. It is not a valid method for solving the Dirac equation or for preventing variational collapse in a rigorous manner.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. In many-electron relativistic calculations, one can define a no-pair effective Hamiltonian by projecting with a positive-energy projector built from free-particle spinors, $P_+^{(0)}$, and using $\\hat H_{\\mathrm{np}} = P_+^{(0)} \\hat H P_+^{(0)}$ to exclude virtual electron–positron pairs; this prevents variational collapse in practice and is widely used in computational chemistry.**\n\nThis statement accurately describes the standard practical implementation of the projection methodology in computational chemistry. While the problem is posed for a single electron, methods are developed for many-electron systems. The \"exact\" projector $P_+$ for the full Hamiltonian $\\hat H$ is unknown. Therefore, in practice, one uses the projector $P_+^{(0)}$ corresponding to the free-particle Dirac Hamiltonian, which is known analytically. Projecting the full many-electron Hamiltonian $\\hat H$ (which includes electron-electron interactions) with $P_+^{(0)}$ defines the \"no-pair\" Hamiltonian. This approximation excludes quantum electrodynamic effects like virtual electron-positron pair creation from the electronic structure calculation, thereby preventing variational collapse and providing a stable, computationally tractable framework. This is the foundation of methods like Dirac-Hartree-Fock. This statement correctly explains *how* projection is used \"in practice\".\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2464122"}]}
