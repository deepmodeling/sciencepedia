The Complete Active Space Self-Consistent Field (CASSCF) method is a foundational multi-configurational approach designed for such situations. In a CASSCF calculation, a subset of electrons, termed 'active' electrons, are distributed in all possible ways among a corresponding subset of 'active' orbitals.\n\nConsider a general CAS($M,N$) calculation, where $M$ is the number of active electrons and $N$ is the number of active orbitals. The total wavefunction is then constructed as a linear combination of all possible Configuration State Functions (CSFs) within this active space. A CSF is a specific linear combination of Slater determinants that is a pure eigenfunction of the total spin squared operator, $\\hat{S}^2$.\n\nFor the archetypal problem of correctly describing the dissociation of a single covalent bond (e.g., in $\\text{H}_2$ or $\\text{F}_2$), the minimal active space required involves the two electrons of the bond and the two orbitals they occupy (the bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals). This corresponds to a CAS(2,2) active space.\n\nYour task is to determine the total number of singlet ($S=0$) Configuration State Functions that can be constructed within a CAS(2,2) active space.", "solution": "In a CAS(2,2) active space there are two spatial orbitals, denote them by $p$ and $q$, and two electrons. The corresponding spin orbitals are $p\\alpha$, $p\\beta$, $q\\alpha$, and $q\\beta$. The total number of distinct two-electron Slater determinants that can be formed from these four spin orbitals is the binomial coefficient\n$$\n\\binom{4}{2}=6.\n$$\nAn explicit list is\n$$\n|p\\alpha, p\\beta\\rangle,\\quad |q\\alpha, q\\beta\\rangle,\\quad |p\\alpha, q\\alpha\\rangle,\\quad |p\\beta, q\\beta\\rangle,\\quad |p\\alpha, q\\beta\\rangle,\\quad |p\\beta, q\\alpha\\rangle.\n$$\nConfiguration State Functions (CSFs) are pure eigenfunctions of $\\hat{S}^{2}$ formed as linear combinations of these determinants (or, in special cases, equal to a single determinant).\n\n1) Determinants with both electrons in the same spatial orbital are necessarily closed-shell singlets.

The active space is constructed from the valence $\\sigma$ bonding and $\\sigma^*$ antibonding molecular orbitals, denoted as $\\sigma_g$ and $\\sigma_u$ respectively.

The results indicate a breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, meaning the electronic and nuclear motions are strongly coupled.\n\nB. The results indicate the presence of strong static (or non-dynamic) correlation, meaning the ground state wavefunction is poorly described by a single Slater determinant and requires a linear combination of multiple electronic configurations.\n\nC. The results indicate a high degree of dynamic correlation, which is the instantaneous repulsion that causes electrons to avoid each other.\n\nD. The results indicate that the molecule has become highly ionic, with both electrons from the bond localizing on one of the fluorine atoms.\n\nE. The results indicate a significant Basis Set Superposition Error (BSSE), which is an artifact of using incomplete atomic basis sets.", "solution": "We identify the active space as two spatial orbitals, $\\sigma_{g}$ and $\\sigma_{u}$, with two valence electrons. The natural orbital occupation numbers (NOONs) are the eigenvalues of the one-particle reduced density matrix and equal the expectation values of the number operators for the natural orbitals. For orbital $p$, the number operator is $\\hat{n}_{p}=\\sum_{\\sigma}a_{p\\sigma}^{\\dagger}a_{p\\sigma}$.\n\nAt the equilibrium geometry, a single Slater determinant with both electrons in the bonding orbital, $(\\sigma_{g})^{2}$, is an adequate zeroth-order description. Hence the NOONs are close to $2$ for $\\sigma_{g}$ and $0$ for $\\sigma_{u}$, with small deviations (from $2$ and $0$) reflecting weak correlation: $n(\\sigma_{g})\\approx 1.98$, $n(\\sigma_{u})\\approx 0.02$.\n\nAs the bond is stretched, $\\sigma_{g}$ and $\\sigma_{u}$ become nearly degenerate. The correct dissociation limit for a homonuclear diatomic with two electrons in the bond is two neutral fragments, each carrying one unpaired electron. In the symmetry-adapted MO basis, the corresponding singlet state is the open-shell singlet with one electron in each of $\\sigma_{g}$ and $\\sigma_{u}$, properly spin-coupled. A convenient second-quantized expression for this singlet is\n$$\n|\\Psi_{\\text{OS}}\\rangle=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(a_{\\sigma_{g}\\alpha}^{\\dagger}a_{\\sigma_{u}\\beta}^{\\dagger}-a_{\\sigma_{g}\\beta}^{\\dagger}a_{\\sigma_{u}\\alpha}^{\\dagger}\\right)|0\\rangle.\n$$\nThe occupation of each spatial orbital is obtained from the expectation value of its number operator:\n$$\n\\langle \\Psi_{\\text{OS}}|\\hat{n}_{\\sigma_{g}}|\\Psi_{\\text{OS}}\\rangle\n=\\sum_{\\sigma}\\langle \\Psi_{\\text{OS}}|a_{\\sigma_{g}\\sigma}^{\\dagger}a_{\\sigma_{g}\\sigma}|\\Psi_{\\text{OS}}\\rangle=1,\n$$\n$$\n\\langle \\Psi_{\\text{OS}}|\\hat{n}_{\\sigma_{u}}|\\Psi_{\\text{OS}}\\rangle\n=\\sum_{\\sigma}\\langle \\Psi_{\\text{OS}}|a_{\\sigma_{u}\\sigma}^{\\dagger}a_{\\sigma_{u}\\sigma}|\\Psi_{\\text{OS}}\\rangle=1.\n$$\nThus, in the dissociation limit, the exact singlet has $n(\\sigma_{g})=1$ and $n(\\sigma_{u})=1$. The CASSCF results in Case B, $n(\\sigma_{g})\\approx 1.05$ and $n(\\sigma_{u})\\approx 0.95$, are a numerical manifestation of this limit and reflect the near-degeneracy of $\\sigma_{g}$ and $\\sigma_{u}$.\n\nThis behavior is the hallmark of strong static (non-dynamic) correlation: the ground-state wavefunction is not well described by a single determinant but requires a multiconfigurational description. In a minimal two-orbital active space, CASSCF captures precisely this static correlation by allowing a linear combination of configurations such as $(\\sigma_{g})^{2}$, $(\\sigma_{u})^{2}$, and the open-shell singlet $(\\sigma_{g})^{1}(\\sigma_{u})^{1}$, with the latter dominating at large $R$.\n\nWe now rule out the other options:\n- A is about failure of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, which concerns coupling between electronic and nuclear motion. NOONs approaching one for near-degenerate orbitals at large $R$ do not diagnose such breakdown; they diagnose multireference character.\n- C describes dynamic correlation, which typically produces small fractional occupations spread over many orbitals and is not the primary effect in a two-orbital active space; CASSCF primarily accounts for static correlation.\n- D would imply an ionic state with both electrons on one atom; in a homonuclear dissociation, the correct limit is neutral fragments. Ionic character would not yield NOONs near one and one in the symmetric MO basis; rather, it would favor double occupation in one localized orbital.\n- E (BSSE) is an energy artifact due to incomplete basis sets and does not manifest as the systematic NOON pattern of $1/1$ in a properly constructed CASSCF active space.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate physical interpretation of Case B is the presence of strong static correlation requiring multiple electronic configurations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1359587"}, {"introduction": "To fully appreciate the necessity of CASSCF, it is instructive to compare it with simpler methods and see where they fail.
