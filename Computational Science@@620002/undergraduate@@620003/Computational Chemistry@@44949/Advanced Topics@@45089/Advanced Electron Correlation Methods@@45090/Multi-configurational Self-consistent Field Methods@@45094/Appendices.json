The hopping term moves an electron from one site to another, taking the covalent state $|\\Phi_3\\rangle$ to a superposition of ionic states, which are orthogonal to $|\\Phi_3\\rangle$. Thus, $H_{33} = 0$.\n\nOff-diagonal elements:\n- $\\langle \\Phi_1 | \\hat{H} | \\Phi_2 \\rangle = H_{12}$: The Hamiltonian contains only one-electron operators.

I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n### Derivation\nA CASSCF calculation is designed to correctly describe electronic structures where strong (or static) electron correlation is significant. Homolytic bond dissociation is the classic case. The fundamental principle for constructing a minimal active space to describe the breaking of a chemical bond is to include the electrons forming the bond and both the bonding and corresponding antibonding molecular orbitals. As the bond dissociates, these two orbitals become degenerate, and a proper description requires at least two configurations: one with the bonding orbital doubly occupied, and one with the antibonding orbital doubly occupied.\n\n1.  **Carbon–Carbon Single Bond (e.g., in $\\mathrm{H_3C-CH_3}$)**\n    A single bond is a $\\sigma$ bond, formed by two electrons. Near equilibrium, the ground state is dominated by the configuration where these two electrons occupy the bonding $\\sigma$ molecular orbital. Upon homolytic dissociation, $\\mathrm{R_3C-CR_3} \\to \\mathrm{R_3C}\\cdot + \\cdot\\mathrm{CR_3}$, the system becomes two radical fragments. This process can only be described qualitatively if the active space includes the two electrons of the $\\sigma$ bond and the two relevant orbitals: the bonding $\\sigma$ orbital and the antibonding $\\sigma^*$ orbital. The number of active electrons is $n=2$, and the number of active spatial orbitals is $m=2$. Therefore, the minimal active space is $\\mathrm{CAS}(2,2)$.\n\n2.  **Carbon–Carbon Double Bond (e.g., in $\\mathrm{H_2C=CH_2}$)**\n    A double bond consists of one $\\sigma$ bond and one $\\pi$ bond. To describe its dissociation into two carbon fragments, one must account for the breaking of both bonds. Applying the principle from the single bond case to each component:\n    - For the $\\sigma$ bond, we require the $\\sigma$ and $\\sigma^*$ orbitals.\n    - For the $\\pi$ bond, we require the $\\pi$ and $\\pi^*$ orbitals.\n    The electrons involved are the $2$ electrons from the $\\sigma$ bond and the $2$ electrons from the $\\pi$ bond, for a total of $n=4$ active electrons. The orbitals are the $\\sigma$, $\\sigma^*$, $\\pi$, and $\\pi^*$ orbitals, for a total of $m=4$ active spatial orbitals. Thus, the minimal active space is $\\mathrm{CAS}(4,4)$.\n\n3.  **Carbon–Carbon Triple Bond (e.g., in $\\mathrm{HC \\equiv CH}$)**\n    A triple bond consists of one $\\sigma$ bond and two orthogonal $\\pi$ bonds (let us call them $\\pi_x$ and $\\pi_y$). To describe its complete homolytic cleavage, all three bonds must be broken. This necessitates including the bonding-antibonding pair for each bond in the active space:\n    - For the $\\sigma$ bond: $\\sigma$ and $\\sigma^*$ orbitals.\n    - For the first $\\pi$ bond: $\\pi_x$ and $\\pi_x^*$ orbitals.\n    - For the second $\\pi$ bond: $\\pi_y$ and $\\pi_y^*$ orbitals.\n    The total number of active electrons is $2 (\\sigma) + 2 (\\pi_x) + 2 (\\pi_y) = 6$, so $n=6$. The total number of active spatial orbitals is $2+2+2=6$, so $m=6$. The minimal active space is therefore $\\mathrm{CAS}(6,6)$.\n\nThe derived sequence of minimal active spaces for single, double, and triple bonds is $\\mathrm{CAS}(2,2)$, $\\mathrm{CAS}(4,4)$, and $\\mathrm{CAS}(6,6)$, respectively.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Single: $\\mathrm{CAS}(2,2)$; Double: $\\mathrm{CAS}(4,4)$; Triple: $\\mathrm{CAS}(6,6)$**\nThis option perfectly matches the derived minimal active spaces. Each space correctly includes the bonding electrons and the associated bonding and antibonding orbitals for the bond(s) being broken.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Single: $\\mathrm{CAS}(2,2)$; Double: $\\mathrm{CAS}(2,2)$; Triple: $\\mathrm{CAS}(4,4)$**\nThis option is incorrect. While $\\mathrm{CAS}(2,2)$ is correct for a single bond, it is insufficient for a double bond, as it can only describe the breaking of one of the two bonds (either $\\sigma$ or $\\pi$). Similarly, $\\mathrm{CAS}(4,4)$ is insufficient for a triple bond, as it can only describe the breaking of two of the three bonds. The description of dissociation would be qualitatively wrong.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Single: $\\mathrm{CAS}(2,1)$; Double: $\\mathrm{CAS}(4,2)$; Triple: $\\mathrm{CAS}(6,3)$**\nThis option demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding. A $\\mathrm{CAS}(n,m)$ with $m=n/2$ (assuming $n$ is even) corresponds to a single-determinant calculation where all active orbitals are doubly occupied. This is the Hartree-Fock reference itself, which is exactly the method that fails to describe dissociation. For a multi-configurational description of bond breaking, the number of active orbitals must be at least twice the number of bonds being broken to include the antibonding counterparts.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Single: $\\mathrm{CAS}(2,2)$; Double: $\\mathrm{CAS}(4,6)$; Triple: $\\mathrm{CAS}(6,8)$**\nThis option suggests active spaces that are larger than the minimal requirement. While a $\\mathrm{CAS}(4,6)$ calculation for a double bond or a $\\mathrm{CAS}(6,8)$ for a triple bond could be performed and might improve the quantitative accuracy (by including dynamic correlation), they are not the *minimal* spaces required for a qualitatively correct description of bond dissociation, as the problem specifies. The minimal space only requires the bonding and antibonding orbitals of the bonds being cleaved.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2459002"}, {"introduction": "A successful $\\mathrm{CASSCF}$ calculation is not always guaranteed, and understanding potential pitfalls is as important as knowing how to set one up.

A convergence failure in this context typically arises when the iterative procedure fails to locate such a stationary point. This often occurs when two or more electronic states are nearly degenerate, leading to an unstable optimization landscape.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\n- **System and Active Space:** Twisted ethylene at a dihedral angle of $90^\\circ$ with a CAS$(2,2)$ active space. This active space comprises the two $\\pi$ electrons and the bonding ($\\pi$) and antibonding ($\\pi^*$) orbitals. At $90^\\circ$ torsion, the overlap between the two carbon $p_z$ orbitals vanishes, making the $\\pi$ and $\\pi^*$ orbitals degenerate.\n- **Physical Origin:** This degeneracy leads to two low-lying singlet states of the same overall symmetry (e.g., $A$ symmetry in the $C_2$ point group, or more precisely classified in the $D_2$ point group) that are nearly degenerate. One state has a covalent diradical character (one electron on each carbon fragment), and the other has a zwitterionic character (two electrons on one carbon fragment). A state-specific CASSCF calculation targeting one of these states (e.g., the ground state) must optimize the orbitals for that state. However, due to the near-degeneracy, a small change in the orbitals can cause the character of the target root to switch with the other state. This phenomenon is known as \"root flipping.\" The optimizer becomes unstable as it oscillates between trying to minimize the energy of two different states. This is a canonical example of where state-specific CASSCF fails and state-averaged CASSCF (SA-CASSCF) is required.\n- **Conclusion:** The system, active space, convergence problem, and physical origin are all correctly described. This is a classic textbook example. **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\n- **System and Active Space:** The chromium dimer, $\\mathrm{Cr}_2$, near its equilibrium geometry with a CAS$(12,12)$ active space. The valence electrons of two chromium atoms ($[\\text{Ar}]\\,3d^5 4s^1$) are $12$ in total. The active space is constructed from the molecular orbitals derived from the valence $3d$ and $4s$ atomic orbitals of both atoms.\n- **Physical Origin:** $\\mathrm{Cr}_2$ is notorious for its complex electronic structure, arising from the many ways to couple the electrons in the spatially compact $d$-orbitals. This results in an extremely dense manifold of low-lying electronic states. Within a single symmetry block, there exist very many states with nearly identical energies. A state-specific CASSCF optimization navigates an energy landscape that is exceptionally flat and contains numerous local minima corresponding to these different states. This situation makes it highly probable that the optimizer will inadvertently switch between roots during the iterative process, a problem analogous to root flipping but on a much larger scale, correctly described as \"root mixing.\" This is a well-known, extreme challenge for CASSCF methods.\n- **Conclusion:** The description of $\\mathrm{Cr}_2$ as a problematic system for state-specific CASSCF is accurate, and the reasoning is sound. The high density of states of the same symmetry makes converging on a single root exceedingly difficult. **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\n- **System and Active Space:** Benzene, $\\mathrm{C_6H_6}$, at its equilibrium geometry, with a CAS$(6,6)$ active space consisting of the $\\pi$-system electrons and orbitals.\n- **Physical Origin:** This option claims convergence trouble stems from \"strong intruder Rydberg states that destabilize the ground-state CASSCF optimization.\" Benzene has a stable, closed-shell aromatic ground state that is well-described by even single-reference methods at its equilibrium geometry. A CASSCF$(6,6)$ calculation for the ground state of benzene is a routine procedure and does not typically present major convergence difficulties. The concept of an \"intruder state\" refers to a configuration *outside* the active space (like a Rydberg state or a $\\sigma\\to\\sigma^*$ excitation) that spuriously becomes near-degenerate with the active space states during optimization, causing convergence to fail. While this is a genuine problem, particularly for perturbation theory corrections to CASSCF (e.g., CASPT2), it is not a characteristic or guaranteed failure mode for the ground-state CASSCF optimization of benzene itself. Furthermore, if such a state were to mix in, it would variationally *stabilize* (lower the energy of) the state being optimized, not \"destabilize\" it. The premise that this is a classic convergence problem is incorrect.\n- **Conclusion:** The scenario described is not a well-known example of CASSCF convergence failure. The reasoning regarding intruder states and their effect is imprecise and misapplied. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\n- **System and Active Space:** The nitrogen molecule, $\\mathrm{N}_2$, at its equilibrium geometry with a CAS$(6,6)$ active space (the six valence $2p$ electrons in the six molecular orbitals derived from the $2p$ atomic orbitals).\n- **Physical Origin:** This option claims convergence trouble is due to \"dynamic correlation outside the active space always introduces intruder states that prevent CASSCF convergence even for the ground state.\" At its equilibrium bond length, $\\mathrm{N}_2$ has a large HOMO-LUMO gap and its ground state is dominated by a single Lewis structure. A CASSCF$(6,6)$ calculation is straightforward and converges readily. The statement makes a sweeping and incorrect generalization. Dynamic correlation is, by definition, what is *not* captured by the CASSCF method itself. It does not \"always\" introduce intruder states that prevent CASSCF convergence. As discussed for option C, intruder states are a specific issue, not a universal consequence of dynamic correlation in CASSCF calculations. The fundamental premise that the ground state of $\\mathrm{N}_2$ at equilibrium is a hard case for CASSCF is false.\n- **Conclusion:** This option presents a fundamentally flawed understanding of CASSCF, dynamic correlation, and intruder states. The chosen example is a simple case for CASSCF, not a problematic one. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "2459000"}]}
