This ratio is defined as the ratio of the rate constants for the formation of product $1$ versus product $2$, given by $r_{\\mathrm{kin}}(T) = k_1(T)/k_2(T)$.

The problem provides the definition:\n$$ r_{\\mathrm{therm}}(T) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\circ_1(T) - \\Delta G^\\circ_2(T)}{R\\,T}\\right) $$\nHere, $\\Delta G^\\circ_i(T) = \\Delta H^\\circ_i - T \\Delta S^\\circ_i$ is the standard Gibbs free energy of reaction to form product $i$.

We are explicitly instructed to identify reasons grounded in the physical topology of the potential energy surface, as opposed to numerical or methodological artifacts.\n\nFirst, let us establish the fundamental principles. An IRC is defined as the minimum energy path (MEP) in mass-weighted Cartesian coordinates $\\mathbf{Q}$. It is the path of steepest descent from a first-order saddle point (a transition state, TS) to adjacent local minima on the potential energy surface $V(\\mathbf{Q})$. A stationary point is a point where the gradient of the potential energy is zero: $\\nabla V(\\mathbf{Q}) = \\mathbf{0}$. The character of a stationary point is determined by the Hessian matrix (the matrix of second derivatives), specifically by the number of its negative eigenvalues, which corresponds to the number of imaginary frequencies, $n_{\\text{imag}}$. A minimum has $n_{\\text{imag}} = 0$, while a true transition state for a bimolecular reaction must be a first-order saddle point with $n_{\\text{imag}} = 1$. The IRC path is initiated by displacing the geometry from the TS along the normal mode coordinate corresponding to the single imaginary frequency.\n\nThe problem states that the IRC path, followed from the located stationary point, terminates in \"alternative minima\" rather than the \"hypothesized\" reactant and product. We must evaluate the provided options as potential physical explanations for this observation.\n\nA. The located saddle point actually belongs to a different rearrangement pathway on $V(\\mathbf{Q})$ and therefore connects to alternative minima that are not the targeted reactant and product basins.\n\nThis statement describes a common scenario in the exploration of complex potential energy surfaces. A PES for a polyatomic system can host numerous minima (isomers) and saddle points (transition states) connecting them. A computational search for a transition state for a specific reaction (Reactant $R \\to$ Product $P$) may inadvertently locate a saddle point, $TS'$, that is a true first-order saddle point but connects a different pair of minima, for example, $R' \\to P'$. If the IRC calculation is initiated from $TS'$, it will correctly follow the steepest-descent path on $V(\\mathbf{Q})$ to the basins of $R'$ and $P'$. These are the \"alternative minima\" described in the problem. The failure is not in the IRC method but in the initial identification of the saddle point; the located point is not the TS for the reaction of interest. This is a purely topological reason based on the global structure of $V(\\mathbf{Q})$.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. The stationary point is a higher-order saddle with $n_{\\text{imag}}\\ge 2$ imaginary frequencies, so there is no unique single downhill direction that ensures connection to the desired adjacent minima.\n\nA true transition state is, by definition, a first-order saddle point ($n_{\\text{imag}} = 1$). The single imaginary frequency defines a unique reaction coordinate direction away from the saddle point. If the located stationary point is a higher-order saddle, for example, a second-order saddle point ($n_{\\text{imag}} = 2$), there are two orthogonal directions of negative curvature. There is no longer a unique path of steepest descent that defines an IRC. Any IRC-following algorithm would have to make an arbitrary choice of initial displacement in the space spanned by the two imaginary frequency modes, and the resulting path would not represent a conventional reaction coordinate. Such a point is a \"saddle point on a saddle-point surface\" and connects four minima in the simplest case (for $n_{\\text{imag}} = 2$). The failure to connect to a specific reactant/product pair is a direct consequence of the stationary point's topological character, which is not that of a simple TS.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nC. The post-transition-state region of $V(\\mathbf{Q})$ exhibits a valley–ridge inflection that produces a reaction-path bifurcation, so the downhill path from the saddle can flow into unintended product or reactant minima.\n\nThis describes a more subtle topological feature of $V(\\mathbf{Q})$. After passing a true first-order saddle point, the reaction path, which follows the floor of a valley on the PES, may encounter a point where the valley floor becomes flat in the direction perpendicular to the path. Beyond this point, a ridge can rise in the center of the old valley, splitting it into two new, distinct valleys that descend to different minima. This is a point of bifurcation. An IRC calculation, being deterministic, will follow the path of steepest descent into one of the two new valleys. If the \"hypothesized\" product lies in the other valley, the IRC calculation will appear to have failed by connecting to an \"alternative\" minimum. This phenomenon is a known feature of PES topology and is a crucial concept in understanding reaction dynamics where product ratios do not follow simple transition state theory predictions. The failure to reach the desired basin is a direct result of this branching topology on $V(\\mathbf{Q})$.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nD. The IRC integrator uses too large a step size in the numerical algorithm, which causes the path to miss the desired minima.\n\nThis is a purely numerical or methodological issue. The step size is a parameter of the algorithm used to integrate the steepest-descent path. An excessively large step size can cause the integrator to overshoot the true path, jump across valleys, and land in an incorrect minimum or fail to converge at all. While this is a practical reason for an IRC calculation to fail, the problem explicitly asks for \"physical reasons, grounded in the topology of $V(\\mathbf{Q})$\" and to exclude \"purely numerical or methodological issues\". This option falls squarely into the excluded category.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. The harmonic frequency calculation was run with a minimal basis set, causing the value of the imaginary frequency to be inaccurate and thus preventing connection to the desired minima.\n\nThis is another methodological issue. The choice of basis set is a parameter of the underlying electronic structure calculation that generates the PES, $V(\\mathbf{Q})$. A poor basis set will produce an inaccurate representation of the true PES. This may lead to errors in the location and properties (including frequencies) of stationary points. However, the IRC calculation is performed *on the given, albeit potentially inaccurate, surface*. An inaccurate frequency value does not, in itself, alter the *topology* of the path-following on that surface. The IRC will still trace the steepest-descent path from the saddle point as it exists on that low-quality surface. The root cause described here is the *inaccuracy of the model chemistry*, which is a methodological choice, not a topological feature of the reaction path on a given PES.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nF. Quantum zero-point energy $E_{\\text{ZPE}}$ causes the intrinsic reaction coordinate to skip over intermediate minima and jump directly to the desired product basin, so failure to reach the desired basins indicates that $E_{\\text{ZPE}}$ has misdirected the IRC path.\n\nThis statement is scientifically unsound. The IRC is a concept of classical mechanics, representing a path on the electronic potential energy surface $V(\\mathbf{Q})$. It is independent of and does not include any quantum mechanical effects such as zero-point energy ($E_{\\text{ZPE}}$). $E_{\\text{ZPE}}$ is a quantum correction related to the vibrational modes perpendicular to the reaction path, and while it is critical for calculating accurate reaction rates and understanding tunnelling, it does not \"direct\" or otherwise influence the calculation of the classical IRC path itself. To state that $E_{\\text{ZPE}}$ \"misdirected the IRC path\" is a fundamental misunderstanding of what an IRC is.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nIn conclusion, there are exactly three options that describe distinct physical reasons grounded in the topology of the potential energy surface: the saddle point belonging to an entirely different reaction (A), the stationary point not being a first-order saddle (B), and the reaction path bifurcating after the transition state (C).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "2466374"}]}
