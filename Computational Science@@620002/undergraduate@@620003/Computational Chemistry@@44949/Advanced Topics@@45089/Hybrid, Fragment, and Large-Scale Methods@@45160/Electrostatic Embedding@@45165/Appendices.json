This exercise guides you through the process of implementing the core calculation from first principles: the electrostatic interaction between a quantum mechanical (QM) region and its molecular mechanics (MM) environment. By programming the direct summation of Coulomb's law interactions, you will compute both the embedding energy $E_{\\text{embed}}$ and the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ at a specific point, developing the essential skills needed for all subsequent QM/MM applications [@problem_id:2454995].", "problem": "You must write a complete program that computes the first-order electrostatic embedding energy of a single water molecule, treated at the quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) level under the electrostatic embedding approximation, inside a hollow sphere of radius $R$ populated with fixed classical point charges. The water molecule is the quantum mechanical (QM) subsystem and the surrounding point charges on the sphere are the molecular mechanics (MM) environment. The computation must be based solely on the fundamental electrostatic interaction between charges.\n\nPhysical model and definitions:\n- Represent the water molecule by three point charges located at its atomic positions: one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms. Use fixed partial charges $q_{\\mathrm{O}}=-0.834\\,e$ and $q_{\\mathrm{H}}=+0.417\\,e$ on oxygen and on each hydrogen, respectively, where $e$ is the elementary charge. The geometry is fixed as follows: place the oxygen atom at the origin, the molecule lies in the $x$-$z$ plane, with the bisector aligned along the $+z$ axis. Use an oxygen-hydrogen bond length of $d_{\\mathrm{OH}}=0.09572$ nanometers and a hydrogen-oxygen-hydrogen angle of $\\alpha=104.52$ degrees. Define the half-angle $\\theta=\\alpha/2$ and place the hydrogens at positions $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{H1}}=\\left(d_{\\mathrm{OH}}\\sin\\theta,\\,0,\\,d_{\\mathrm{OH}}\\cos\\theta\\right)$ and $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{H2}}=\\left(-d_{\\mathrm{OH}}\\sin\\theta,\\,0,\\,d_{\\mathrm{OH}}\\cos\\theta\\right)$, while $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{O}}=\\left(0,\\,0,\\,0\\right)$. All coordinates are in nanometers.\n- Let the set of MM point charges be $\\left\\{q_a,\\,\\mathbf{R}_a\\right\\}$, constrained to lie on the sphere of radius $R$ centered at the origin, i.e., $\\left\\lVert \\mathbf{R}_a \\right\\rVert=R$. Each $q_a$ is given in units of the elementary charge $e$, and each $\\mathbf{R}_a$ is given in nanometers.\n- The electrostatic potential at position $\\mathbf{r}$ due to the MM charges is $V_{\\mathrm{MM}}(\\mathbf{r})=\\sum_a \\dfrac{k_e\\,q_a^{(\\mathrm{C})}}{\\left\\lVert \\mathbf{r}^{(\\mathrm{m})}-\\mathbf{R}_a^{(\\mathrm{m})}\\right\\rVert}$, where $k_e=\\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0}$ is the Coulomb constant, superscript $(\\mathrm{C})$ denotes Coulomb units, and superscript $(\\mathrm{m})$ denotes that the positions are in meters.

It describes a standard computational exercise in the field of QM/MM simulations, specifically calculating first-order electrostatic interactions. The physical model, mathematical formulas, and provided constants are all consistent with established principles of classical electrostatics. There are no contradictions or ambiguities. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe core of this problem is the application of Coulomb's Law to calculate the electrostatic potential energy and electric field arising from the interaction between two sets of point charges. The first set represents the quantum mechanical (QM) water molecule, and the second set represents the classical molecular mechanics (MM) environment.\n\nOur procedure is as follows:\n1.  Define the Cartesian coordinates of the three atoms of the water molecule (the QM subsystem) based on the provided internal coordinates (bond length and angle).\n2.  Formulate the expressions for the electrostatic embedding energy ($E_{\\mathrm{embed}}$) and the electric field at the oxygen atom ($\\mathbf{E}_{\\mathrm{O}}$) due to the MM point charges.\n3.  Establish a consistent system of units (SI units) for all physical quantities and derive the necessary conversion factors to report the final results in the requested units of kilojoules per mole ($\\mathrm{kJ/mol}$) and volts per nanometer ($\\mathrm{V/nm}$).\n4.  Implement an algorithm to compute these quantities for each of the three test cases provided.\n\n**1. Geometry of the Water Molecule (QM Subsystem)**\n\nThe water molecule's geometry is fixed. The oxygen atom is at the origin, $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{O}} = (0, 0, 0)$. The molecule lies in the $x$-$z$ plane with its dipole moment aligned with the $z$-axis.\nThe given parameters are the O-H bond length $d_{\\mathrm{OH}} = 0.09572 \\, \\mathrm{nm}$ and the H-O-H bond angle $\\alpha = 104.52^\\circ$. The half-angle is $\\theta = \\alpha/2 = 52.26^\\circ$. To use trigonometric functions, we convert this to radians: $\\theta_{\\mathrm{rad}} = 52.26 \\times (\\pi / 180)$.\n\nThe positions of the two hydrogen atoms, $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{H1}}$ and $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{H2}}$, are calculated as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{H1}} = \\left( d_{\\mathrm{OH}}\\sin\\theta, 0, d_{\\mathrm{OH}}\\cos\\theta \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{H2}} = \\left( -d_{\\mathrm{OH}}\\sin\\theta, 0, d_{\\mathrm{OH}}\\cos\\theta \\right)\n$$\nThe partial charges are $q'_{\\mathrm{O}} = -0.834$ and $q'_{\\mathrm{H1}} = q'_{\\mathrm{H2}} = +0.417$, in units of the elementary charge $e$. We denote charges in units of $e$ with a prime ($q'$) and positions in nanometers with a prime ($\\mathbf{r}'$).\n\n**2. Electrostatic Embedding Energy ($E_{\\mathrm{embed}}$)**\n\nThe first-order electrostatic embedding energy is the sum of pairwise Coulomb interactions between each QM charge and all MM charges.\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{embed}} = \\sum_{i \\in \\{\\mathrm{O,H1,H2}\\}} \\sum_{a \\in \\mathrm{MM}} \\frac{k_e q_i^{(\\mathrm{C})} q_a^{(\\mathrm{C})}}{\\left\\lVert \\mathbf{r}_i^{(\\mathrm{m})} - \\mathbf{R}_a^{(\\mathrm{m})} \\right\\rVert}\n$$\nwhere $k_e$ is the Coulomb constant, superscripts $(\\mathrm{C})$ and $(\\mathrm{m})$ denote charges in Coulombs and positions in meters, respectively.\n\nTo facilitate computation, we work with charges in units of $e$ ($q'$) and positions in nanometers ($\\mathbf{r}'$).\n$q_i^{(\\mathrm{C})} = q'_i e$, $q_a^{(\\mathrm{C})} = q'_a e$, and $\\mathbf{r}^{(\\mathrm{m})} = \\mathbf{r}' \\times 10^{-9}$. Substituting these into the energy expression gives the energy for a single molecule in Joules:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{embed}} [\\mathrm{J}] = \\sum_{i,a} \\frac{k_e (q'_i e)(q'_a e)}{\\left\\lVert (\\mathbf{r}'_i - \\mathbf{R}'_a) \\times 10^{-9} \\right\\rVert} = \\frac{k_e e^2}{10^{-9}} \\sum_{i,a} \\frac{q'_i q'_a}{\\left\\lVert \\mathbf{r}'_i - \\mathbf{R}'_a \\right\\rVert_{\\mathrm{nm}}}\n$$\nTo obtain the molar energy in kilojoules per mole, we multiply by Avogadro's constant $N_{\\mathrm{A}}$ and convert Joules to kilojoules ($1/1000$).\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{embed}} [\\mathrm{kJ/mol}] = E_{\\mathrm{embed}} [\\mathrm{J}] \\times N_{\\mathrm{A}} \\times 10^{-3} = \\left(\\frac{k_e e^2 N_{\\mathrm{A}}}{10^{-6}}\\right) \\sum_{i,a} \\frac{q'_i q'_a}{\\left\\lVert \\mathbf{r}'_i - \\mathbf{R}'_a \\right\\rVert_{\\mathrm{nm}}}\n$$\nThe pre-factor $C_E = k_e e^2 N_{\\mathrm{A}} / 10^{-6}$ is a conversion constant with a value of approximately $138935.4576 \\, \\mathrm{kJ \\cdot nm \\cdot mol^{-1}}$.\n\n**3. Electric Field at Oxygen ($\\mathbf{E}_{\\mathrm{O}}$)**\n\nThe electric field at the oxygen atom's position ($\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{O}} = \\mathbf{0}$) due to the MM charges is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{E}_{\\mathrm{O}} = \\sum_a k_e\\,q_a^{(\\mathrm{C})}\\,\\frac{\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{O}}^{(\\mathrm{m})}-\\mathbf{R}_a^{(\\mathrm{m})}}{\\left\\lVert \\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{O}}^{(\\mathrm{m})}-\\mathbf{R}_a^{(\\mathrm{m})}\\right\\rVert^3}\n$$\nThe MM charges are located on a sphere of radius $R$, so $\\left\\lVert \\mathbf{R}_a \\right\\rVert = R$. Since $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{O}}=\\mathbf{0}$, the expression simplifies. Using charges in units of $e$ and positions in nanometers, we get the field in SI units (V/m):\n$$\n\\mathbf{E}_{\\mathrm{O}}[\\mathrm{V/m}] = -\\sum_{a} k_e (q'_a e) \\frac{\\mathbf{R}'_a \\times 10^{-9}}{(R' \\times 10^{-9})^3} = -\\frac{k_e e}{(10^{-9})^2} \\sum_{a} \\frac{q'_a \\mathbf{R}'_a}{(R')^3} = -k_e e \\cdot 10^{18} \\sum_{a} \\frac{q'_a \\mathbf{R}'_a}{(R')^3}\n$$\nThe problem requires the magnitude of the field in volts per nanometer ($\\mathrm{V/nm}$). The conversion is $1 \\, \\mathrm{V/nm} = 10^9 \\, \\mathrm{V/m}$.\n$$\n\\left\\lVert \\mathbf{E}_{\\mathrm{O}} \\right\\rVert_{\\mathrm{V/nm}} = \\frac{\\left\\lVert \\mathbf{E}_{\\mathrm{O}} \\right\\rVert_{\\mathrm{V/m}}}{10^9} = k_e e \\cdot 10^9 \\left\\lVert \\sum_a \\frac{q'_a \\mathbf{R}'_a}{(R')^3} \\right\\rVert\n$$\nThe pre-factor $C_F = k_e e \\cdot 10^9$ has units of $\\mathrm{V \\cdot nm}$ and a value of approximately $1.4399645$. Thus, the final expression is:\n$$\n\\left\\lVert \\mathbf{E}_{\\mathrm{O}} \\right\\rVert_{\\mathrm{V/nm}} = \\frac{C_F}{(R'_{\\mathrm{nm}})^3} \\left\\lVert \\sum_a q'_a \\mathbf{R}'_a \\right\\rVert\n$$\n\n**4. Algorithmic Implementation**\n\nThe algorithm iterates through each test case. For each case:\n- The QM and MM charge positions and values are defined. All positions are converted to meters and charges to Coulombs for internal calculations to maintain consistency with SI units.\n- For the energy calculation, a double loop is performed over QM atoms $i$ and MM charges $a$. The pairwise interaction energy $k_e q_i q_a / d_{ia}$ is computed and summed. The final sum in Joules is converted to kJ/mol.\n- For the electric field calculation, the vector contribution from each MM charge at the origin is calculated and summed. The magnitude of the total field vector is then determined and converted from V/m to V/nm.\n- The two resulting values for each test case are rounded to six decimal places and stored.\nThe final output is a formatted string representing a list of these result pairs.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.spatial.distance import cdist\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the electrostatic embedding energy and electric field for a water molecule\n    in a sphere of point charges.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Physical constants in SI units\n    K_E = 8.9875517923e9  # Coulomb constant (N m^2 C^-2)\n    E_CHARGE = 1.602176634e-19  # Elementary charge (C)\n    N_A = 6.02214076e23  # Avogadro constant (mol^-1)\n    \n    # Conversion factors\n    NM_TO_M = 1.0e-9\n\n    # --- QM Subsystem (Water Molecule) Setup ---\n    # Partial charges in units of elementary charge e\n    Q_O = -0.834\n    Q_H = 0.417\n    qm_charges_e = np.array([Q_O, Q_H, Q_H])\n    qm_charges_C = qm_charges_e * E_CHARGE\n    \n    # Geometry in nanometers\n    D_OH = 0.09572  # O-H bond length (nm)\n    ALPHA_DEG = 104.52  # H-O-H angle (degrees)\n    theta_rad = np.deg2rad(ALPHA_DEG / 2.0)\n    \n    r_O_nm = np.array([0.0, 0.0, 0.0])\n    r_H1_nm = np.array([D_OH * np.sin(theta_rad), 0.0, D_OH * np.cos(theta_rad)])\n    r_H2_nm = np.array([-D_OH * np.sin(theta_rad), 0.0, D_OH * np.cos(theta_rad)])\n    \n    qm_pos_nm = np.array([r_O_nm, r_H1_nm, r_H2_nm])\n    qm_pos_m = qm_pos_nm * NM_TO_M\n\n    # --- Test Cases ---\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            \"R_nm\": 1.0, \n            \"mm_charges\": [\n                (0.2, (0, 0, 1.0)),\n                (-0.2, (0, 0, -1.0)),\n                (0.1, (1.0/np.sqrt(2), 0, 1.0/np.sqrt(2)))\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"R_nm\": 0.3, \n            \"mm_charges\": [\n                (1.0, (0, 0, 0.3)),\n                (-1.0, (0, 0, -0.3)),\n                (0.5, (0, 0.3, 0))\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"R_nm\": 2.0,\n            \"mm_charges\": [\n                (0.5, (2.0, 0, 0)),\n                (-0.5, (-2.0, 0, 0)),\n                (0.25, (0, 0, 2.0)),\n                (-0.25, (0, 0, -2.0))\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n\n    all_results = []\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        R_nm = case[\"R_nm\"]\n        mm_charges_tuples = case[\"mm_charges\"]\n        \n        mm_charges_e = np.array([charge[0] for charge in mm_charges_tuples])\n        mm_pos_nm = np.array([charge[1] for charge in mm_charges_tuples])\n        \n        # Convert to SI units for calculation\n        mm_charges_C = mm_charges_e * E_CHARGE\n        mm_pos_m = mm_pos_nm * NM_TO_M\n        R_m = R_nm * NM_TO_M\n\n        # --- Embedding Energy Calculation ---\n        # Calculate pairwise distances between all QM atoms and all MM charges\n        # cdist computes a (N_QM x N_MM) matrix of distances in meters\n        dist_matrix_m = cdist(qm_pos_m, mm_pos_m, 'euclidean')\n        \n        # Create a (N_QM x N_MM) matrix of charge products (q_i * q_a)\n        charge_product_matrix_C2 = np.outer(qm_charges_C, mm_charges_C)\n        \n        # Calculate interaction energy for each pair and sum them up\n        # The result is the total energy in Joules\n        energy_matrix_J = K_E * charge_product_matrix_C2 / dist_matrix_m\n        total_energy_J = np.sum(energy_matrix_J)\n        \n        # Convert to kJ/mol\n        energy_kJ_per_mol = total_energy_J * N_A / 1000.0\n\n        # --- Electric Field Calculation ---\n        # Position of oxygen is the origin, so r_O is the zero vector\n        # E = sum_a k_e * q_a * (r_O - R_a) / |r_O - R_a|^3\n        # E = -k_e * sum(q_a * R_a / |R_a|^3)\n        # Since |R_a| = R for all a, we can factor out R^3\n        \n        # Reshape for broadcasting\n        mm_charges_C_col = mm_charges_C[:, np.newaxis]\n        \n        # Sum of q_a * R_a vectors\n        sum_qR_vec_Cm = np.sum(mm_charges_C_col * mm_pos_m, axis=0) # Result is a 1x3 vector\n        \n        # Total E-field vector in V/m\n        E_vec_Vm = -K_E * sum_qR_vec_Cm / (R_m**3)\n        \n        # Magnitude of the E-field in V/m\n        E_mag_Vm = np.linalg.norm(E_vec_Vm)\n        \n        # Convert to V/nm\n        E_mag_Vnm = E_mag_Vm / 1.0e9\n\n        all_results.append([round(energy_kJ_per_mol, 6), round(E_mag_Vnm, 6)])\n\n    # Format the final output string exactly as requested\n    sub_lists = [f\"[{e},{E}]\" for e, E in all_results]\n    final_string = f\"[{','.join(sub_lists)}]\"\n    print(final_string)\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2454995"}, {"introduction": "With a grasp of the fundamental calculations, we can now explore a key consequence of electrostatic embedding: its effect on the electronic properties of the QM system.

The quantum subsystem is acetone, and the molecular mechanics environment is modeled as a single point charge representing an arginine cation. You will compute the change in the excitation energy by treating the external electrostatic field as a classical perturbation and using the leading orders of time-independent perturbation theory together with classical electrostatics.\n\nUse the following fundamental base, which is standard and widely accepted:\n- The electric field of a point charge from Coulomb’s law: for a point charge of magnitude $q$ located at position vector $\\mathbf{R}$ in a medium with relative permittivity $\\varepsilon_{r}$, the field at the origin is $\\mathbf{E} = -\\dfrac{1}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} \\varepsilon_{r}} \\dfrac{q \\, \\mathbf{R}}{\\lVert \\mathbf{R} \\rVert^{3}}$.\n- The energy of a permanent dipole $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ in a uniform electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ is $U_{\\text{perm}} = - \\boldsymbol{\\mu} \\cdot \\mathbf{E}$.\n- The energy associated with an induced dipole for an isotropically polarizable system with scalar polarizability $\\alpha$ in a uniform field of magnitude $E$ is $U_{\\text{ind}} = - \\dfrac{1}{2}\\,\\alpha\\,E^{2}$.\n- In electrostatic embedding of a quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) type, the shift of an electronic state’s energy due to the classical field is given by the sum of the permanent dipole interaction and the induced dipole energy for that state.\n- The excitation energy shift is the difference between the field-induced shifts of the excited and ground electronic states.\n\nAssumptions and parameters for acetone and the arginine cation:\n- Consider the acetone carbonyl oxygen located at the origin, with the carbonyl axis along the $+x$ direction.

The problem is therefore deemed valid and a formal solution will be constructed.\n\nThe objective is to compute the shift in the $S_{0} \\rightarrow S_{1}$ electronic excitation energy of an acetone molecule due to the electrostatic field of a nearby arginine cation. This is a classic application of perturbation theory, where the external field from the molecular mechanics (MM) point charge perturbs the energy levels of the quantum mechanical (QM) subsystem, acetone.\n\nThe total energy of an electronic state $n$ within a uniform external electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ can be expressed as a series expansion. To second order, the energy shift $\\Delta E_{n}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{n} = -\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{n} \\cdot \\mathbf{E} - \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{E} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{n} \\cdot \\mathbf{E} + \\dots\n$$\nHere, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{n}$ is the permanent electric dipole moment of state $n$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{n}$ is its polarizability tensor.

All calculations will be performed in SI units. The given parameters and constants are:\n- Vacuum permittivity: $\\varepsilon_{0} = 8.8541878128 \\times 10^{-12} \\, \\text{F}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$.\n- Elementary charge: $e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{C}$.\n- Position vectors $\\mathbf{R}$ are given in Angstroms ($\\text{\\AA}$), and must be converted to meters ($1\\,\\text{\\AA} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\text{m}$).\n- Charge of arginine cation: $q = +e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{C}$.\n- Difference dipole moment magnitude: $\\lVert \\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\mu} \\rVert = 1.20$ Debye. This is converted to Coulomb-meters ($1\\,\\text{D} = 3.33564 \\times 10^{-30}\\,\\text{C}\\,\\text{m}$), yielding $\\lVert \\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\mu} \\rVert_{SI} = 1.20 \\times 3.33564 \\times 10^{-30} \\approx 4.002768 \\times 10^{-30}\\,\\text{C}\\,\\text{m}$. Since it is aligned along the $+x$ axis, $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\mu} = (\\lVert \\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\mu} \\rVert_{SI}, 0, 0)$.\n- Isotropic difference polarizability: $\\Delta \\alpha_{\\text{iso}} = 3.00 \\, \\text{\\AA}^{3}$. The conversion to SI units is $\\alpha_{SI} = \\alpha_{\\text{\\AA}^3} \\times (4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} \\times 10^{-30} \\, \\text{C}\\,\\text{m}^{2}\\,\\text{V}^{-1})$. Thus, $\\Delta \\alpha_{\\text{iso, SI}} = 3.00 \\times (4\\pi \\times 8.8541878128 \\times 10^{-12}) \\times 10^{-30} \\approx 3.33795 \\times 10^{-40}\\,\\text{C}\\,\\text{m}^{2}\\,\\text{V}^{-1}$.\n- Baseline gas-phase excitation energy: $E_{\\text{gas}} = 4.40 \\, \\text{eV}$.\n\nFor each test case, specified by a position vector $\\mathbf{R}$ and relative permittivity $\\varepsilon_r$:\n1.  The electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ at the origin generated by the point charge $q$ at position $\\mathbf{R}$ is calculated using the standard formula:\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{E} = -\\dfrac{1}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} \\varepsilon_{r}} \\dfrac{q \\, \\mathbf{R}}{\\lVert \\mathbf{R} \\rVert^{3}}\n    $$\n    This is because the vector from the source charge at $\\mathbf{R}$ to the observation point at the origin is $-\\mathbf{R}$. The vector $\\mathbf{R}$ and its norm $\\lVert \\mathbf{R} \\rVert$ are first converted to SI units.\n\n2.  The first-order energy shift $\\Delta E^{(1)}$ is computed. Given that $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ has only an x-component, this simplifies to:\n    $$\n    \\Delta E^{(1)} = - \\Delta \\mu_x E_x\n    $$\n\n3.  The second-order energy shift $\\Delta E^{(2)}$ is computed. This requires the squared magnitude of the electric field, $E^2 = \\lVert \\mathbf{E} \\rVert^2$:\n    $$\n    \\Delta E^{(2)} = - \\frac{1}{2} \\Delta \\alpha_{\\text{iso, SI}} E^2\n    $$\n\n4.  The total excitation energy shift in Joules, $\\Delta E_{\\text{exc, J}}$, is the sum $\\Delta E^{(1)} + \\Delta E^{(2)}$.\n\n5.  This shift is converted from Joules to electronvolts (eV) by dividing by the elementary charge $e$:\n    $$\n    \\Delta E_{\\text{exc, eV}} = \\frac{\\Delta E_{\\text{exc, J}}}{e}\n    $$\n\n6.  Finally, the total excitation energy in the presence of the charge, $E_{\\text{exc}}$, is computed by adding the shift to the gas-phase value:\n    $$\n    E_{\\text{exc}} = E_{\\text{gas}} + \\Delta E_{\\text{exc, eV}}\n    $$\nThe final result for each case is rounded to six decimal places, as required.

Round the final results to six decimal places as required.\nThis approach avoids recomputing the full interaction sum for each test case, leading to an efficient and direct solution.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the QM/MM electrostatic embedding problem by calculating the energy change\n    upon muting specific MM residues.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define physical constants as per the problem statement.\n    # Elementary charge in Coulombs.\n    E_CHARGE = 1.602176634e-19  # C\n    # Vacuum permittivity in Farads per meter (C^2 N^-1 m^-2).\n    VACUUM_PERMITTIVITY = 8.8541878128e-12\n    # Avogadro's number in mol^-1.\n    AVOGADRO = 6.02214076e+23\n\n    # Derive the conversion factor to convert from dimensionless energy sum (e^2/nm) to kJ/mol.\n    # The formula is C = (k_e * e^2 * N_A) / (1 J -> kJ). k_e has 1/nm in it after unit conversion.\n    # k_e in standard units is 1/(4*pi*eps0).\n    # Energy [J] = k_e_si * (q1_e*e)*(q2_e*e) / (d_nm*1e-9)\n    # Energy [kJ/mol] = Energy[J] * N_A / 1000\n    # = (1/(4*pi*eps0)) * e^2 * N_A / (1e-9 * 1000) * (q1_e*q2_e/d_nm)\n    # This is the conversion factor for the sum part.\n    CONVERSION_FACTOR = (E_CHARGE**2 * AVOGADRO) / (4 * np.pi * VACUUM_PERMITTIVITY * 1e-9 * 1000)\n    # The resulting factor is approximately 138935.458 kJ·nm / (mol·e^2).\n    # The solution derivation had a typo in the factor value.
