It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a clear, formalizable task based on fundamental principles of quantum chemistry. All necessary data are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or ambiguities. We will proceed with a solution.\n\nThe central task is to compute the fraction of the total ground-state electronic energy that originates from electron correlation. This requires an understanding of the hierarchy of approximations in electronic structure theory. Within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, where nuclei are considered fixed, the electronic energy is the solution to the electronic Schrödinger equation. The Hartree-Fock ($HF$) method provides a foundational, yet approximate, solution to this equation. It models each electron as moving in an average, or mean, field created by all other electrons, thereby neglecting the instantaneous correlations in their motions.\n\nThe electron correlation energy, $E_{\\mathrm{corr}}$, is formally defined as the correction needed to elevate the approximate Hartree-Fock energy, $E_{\\mathrm{HF}}$, to the exact nonrelativistic electronic ground-state energy, $E_{\\mathrm{exact}}$, for a given nuclear geometry. This definition is expressed by the equation:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{corr}} = E_{\\mathrm{exact}} - E_{\\mathrm{HF}}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the fraction, $f$, which represents the magnitude of this correlation energy relative to the magnitude of the total exact electronic energy. This is given by:\n$$\nf = \\frac{\\lvert E_{\\mathrm{corr}} \\rvert}{\\lvert E_{\\mathrm{exact}} \\rvert}\n$$\nWe will now apply these formulae to the three specified cases. All energies are provided in the atomic unit of energy, the Hartree ($E_{\\mathrm{h}}$).\n\nCase $1$: Water molecule ($\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$)\nThe provided data for the water molecule are:\n$E_{\\mathrm{HF}} = -76.026760737 \\ E_{\\mathrm{h}}$\n$E_{\\mathrm{exact}} = -76.438000000 \\ E_{\\mathrm{h}}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the correlation energy, $E_{\\mathrm{corr}}$:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{corr}} = (-76.438000000) - (-76.026760737) = -0.411239263 \\ E_{\\mathrm{h}}\n$$\nNext, we compute the fraction, $f_1$:\n$$\nf_1 = \\frac{\\lvert -0.411239263 \\rvert}{\\lvert -76.438000000 \\rvert} = \\frac{0.411239263}{76.438000000} \\approx 0.005379895\n$$\nRounding to eight digits after the decimal point, the result is $0.00537990$.\n\nCase $2$: Hydrogen atom ($\\mathrm{H}$)\nThe provided data for the hydrogen atom are:\n$E_{\\mathrm{HF}} = -0.500000000 \\ E_{\\mathrm{h}}$\n$E_{\\mathrm{exact}} = -0.500000000 \\ E_{\\mathrm{h}}$\n\nThis is a special boundary case. The hydrogen atom consists of only one proton and one electron. By definition, electron correlation describes the interaction between multiple electrons. Since there is only one electron, there are no electron-electron interactions to correlate. The Hartree-Fock method is therefore exact for any one-electron system. Consequently, the correlation energy must be zero. We verify this with the given data:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{corr}} = (-0.500000000) - (-0.500000000) = 0.0 \\ E_{\\mathrm{h}}\n$$\nThe corresponding fraction, $f_2$, is therefore also zero:\n$$\nf_2 = \\frac{\\lvert 0.0 \\rvert}{\\lvert -0.500000000 \\rvert} = \\frac{0.0}{0.5} = 0.0\n$$\nAs a decimal with eight digits, the result is $0.00000000$.\n\nCase $3$: Helium atom ($\\mathrm{He}$)\nThe provided data for the two-electron helium atom are:\n$E_{\\mathrm{HF}} = -2.861679995 \\ E_{\\mathrm{h}}$\n$E_{\\mathrm{exact}} = -2.9037243770341195 \\ E_{\\mathrm{h}}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the correlation energy, $E_{\\mathrm{corr}}$:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{corr}} = (-2.9037243770341195) - (-2.861679995) = -0.0420443820341195 \\ E_{\\mathrm{h}}\n$$\nThis non-zero value is the correlation energy for helium, often cited as a classic example. Now, we compute the fraction, $f_3$:\n$$\nf_3 = \\frac{\\lvert -0.0420443820341195 \\rvert}{\\lvert -2.9037243770341195 \\rvert} = \\frac{0.0420443820341195}{2.9037243770341195} \\approx 0.0144794276\n$$\nRounding to eight digits after the decimal point gives $0.01447943$.\n\nIn summary, the correlation energy constitutes a small but critical fraction of the total electronic energy. For the water molecule, it is approximately $0.54\\%$; for the helium atom, it is approximately $1.45\\%$; and for the one-electron hydrogen atom, it is exactly $0\\%$.
