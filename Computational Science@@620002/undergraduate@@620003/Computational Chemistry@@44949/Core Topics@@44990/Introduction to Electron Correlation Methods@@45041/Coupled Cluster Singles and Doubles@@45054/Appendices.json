The hydrogen atom is a fundamental system in quantum mechanics. The Hartree-Fock method, Coupled Cluster theory, and the concept of electron correlation are central pillars of modern computational chemistry. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information (system, methods, basis set limit, definitions) to arrive at a unique, logical conclusion. The language is objective and precise. The idealization of a \"complete one-electron basis\" is a standard theoretical construct used to separate method error from basis set error. The problem does not violate any fundamental principles, is not ambiguous, and is directly relevant to the specified scientific field.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is declared **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Answer\n\nThe problem concerns the application of the Hartree-Fock (HF) and Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (CCSD) methods to a one-electron system, specifically the hydrogen atom ($Z=1$).\n\n$1$. **The Hamiltonian and the Exact Solution:**\nWithin the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, the nucleus is stationary. The non-relativistic electronic Hamiltonian for a one-electron system with nuclear charge $Z$ is purely a one-electron operator:\n$$ \\hat{H} = \\hat{h}(1) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla_1^2 - \\frac{Z}{r_1} $$\nFor the hydrogen atom, $Z=1$. This Hamiltonian does not contain any two-electron terms ($1/r_{ij}$), as there is only one electron. The Schrödinger equation, $\\hat{H}\\Psi = E\\Psi$, is exactly solvable for this system. The energy obtained, $E_{\\mathrm{exact}}$, is the exact non-relativistic electronic energy.\n\n$2$. **The Hartree-Fock (HF) Method for a One-Electron System:**\nThe HF method approximates the many-electron wavefunction as a single Slater determinant. For a one-electron system, this determinant is simply the one-electron orbital itself, $|\\Phi_0\\rangle = |\\psi_1\\rangle$. The HF energy is found by minimizing the expectation value of the Hamiltonian, $E_{\\mathrm{HF}} = \\langle\\Phi_0|\\hat{H}|\\Phi_0\\rangle$. The minimization process leads to the canonical HF equations, $\\hat{f}|\\psi_i\\rangle = \\epsilon_i|\\psi_i\\rangle$, where $\\hat{f}$ is the Fock operator.\n\nThe general form of the Fock operator for electron $1$ is:\n$$ \\hat{f}(1) = \\hat{h}(1) + \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\left( \\hat{J}_j(1) - \\hat{K}_j(1) \\right) $$\nwhere $\\hat{J}_j$ is the Coulomb operator and $\\hat{K}_j$ is the exchange operator, which both describe interactions with other electrons. For a one-electron system ($N=1$), the sum describes the interaction of the electron with itself. This self-interaction is known to be exactly canceled, i.e., $\\hat{J}_1(1) - \\hat{K}_1(1) = 0$. Consequently, the Fock operator simplifies to the core Hamiltonian:\n$$ \\hat{f}(1) = \\hat{h}(1) $$\nTherefore, the HF equation for the single electron becomes $\\hat{h}(1)|\\psi_1\\rangle = \\epsilon_1|\\psi_1\\rangle$. This is identical to the exact Schrödinger equation for the system.\n\nGiven that a \"complete one-electron basis\" is used, the HF calculation is able to find the exact orbital $|\\psi_1\\rangle$ and thus the exact energy. This means that for any one-electron system, the HF method is not an approximation but is exact.\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{HF}} = E_{\\mathrm{exact}} $$\n\n$3$. **Electronic Correlation Energy:**\nThe problem defines correlation energy as $E_{\\mathrm{corr}} = E_{\\mathrm{exact}} - E_{\\mathrm{HF}}$. Based on our finding that $E_{\\mathrm{HF}} = E_{\\mathrm{exact}}$, the exact correlation energy for a one-electron system is identically zero.\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{corr}} = E_{\\mathrm{exact}} - E_{\\mathrm{HF}} = 0 $$\nElectron correlation is fundamentally a many-electron phenomenon, arising from the inadequacy of the mean-field (HF) approximation to describe the instantaneous interactions between electrons. With only one electron, such interactions do not exist, and thus there is no correlation.\n\n$4$. **The Coupled Cluster (CCSD) Method for a One-Electron System:**\nThe CCSD wavefunction is constructed as $|\\Psi_{\\text{CCSD}}\\rangle = e^{\\hat{T}}|\\Phi_0\\rangle$, where $|\\Phi_0\\rangle$ is the HF reference and the cluster operator $\\hat{T}$ is truncated at single and double excitations: $\\hat{T} = \\hat{T}_1 + \\hat{T}_2$.\n- The singles operator, $\\hat{T}_1 = \\sum_{i,a} t_i^a \\hat{a}_a^\\dagger \\hat{a}_i$, excites one electron from an occupied orbital $i$ to a virtual orbital $a$.\n- The doubles operator, $\\hat{T}_2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\sum_{i,j,a,b} t_{ij}^{ab} \\hat{a}_a^\\dagger \\hat{a}_b^\\dagger \\hat{a}_j \\hat{a}_i$, excites two electrons from occupied orbitals $i,j$ to virtual orbitals $a,b$.\n\nFor a one-electron system, the occupied space contains only one orbital. It is therefore impossible to select two occupied orbitals for a double excitation. The operator $\\hat{T}_2$ cannot produce a non-zero result when acting on a one-electron determinant. Consequently, all double excitation amplitudes must be zero: $t_{ij}^{ab} = 0$.\n\nThe CCSD equations for the amplitudes are derived from projecting the CC Schrödinger equation onto the space of excited determinants. These equations are driven by the two-electron part of the Hamiltonian. Since the Hamiltonian for a one-electron system has no two-electron terms, all two-electron integrals are zero.\nThe double-excitation amplitude equations have the general form:\n$$ (\\epsilon_a + \\epsilon_b - \\epsilon_i - \\epsilon_j) t_{ij}^{ab} = \\langle ij || ab \\rangle + \\dots $$\nwhere $\\langle ij || ab \\rangle$ is an antisymmetrized two-electron integral. Since all such integrals are zero, and the remaining terms also depend on two-electron interactions, the only solution is $t_{ij}^{ab}=0$.\nWith $t_{ij}^{ab}=0$, the single-excitation amplitude equations simplify to:\n$$ (\\epsilon_a - \\epsilon_i) t_i^a = \\dots $$\nThe terms on the right-hand side also vanish because they involve two-electron integrals that couple singles and doubles amplitudes. This leaves $(\\epsilon_a - \\epsilon_i) t_i^a = 0$. Since for an excitation $\\epsilon_a > \\epsilon_i$, the energy difference is non-zero, requiring that the singles amplitudes must also be zero: $t_i^a=0$.\n\nTherefore, for a one-electron system, all cluster amplitudes vanish, $\\hat{T} = \\hat{T}_1 + \\hat{T}_2 = 0$. The CCSD wavefunction becomes identical to the HF reference:\n$$ |\\Psi_{\\text{CCSD}}\\rangle = e^0 |\\Phi_0\\rangle = |\\Phi_0\\rangle = |\\Psi_{\\text{HF}}\\rangle $$\nThe CCSD energy is thus equal to the HF energy:\n$$ E_{\\text{CCSD}} = E_{\\text{HF}} $$\nThe correlation energy predicted by CCSD is $E_{\\text{CCSD}} - E_{\\text{HF}}$. For this system, the value is $0$.\nSo, CCSD correctly finds that the correlation energy is zero for a one-electron system.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. $E_{\\mathrm{corr}}=0$ because there is no electron–electron interaction in a $1$-electron system, so HF is exact and the CCSD cluster amplitudes vanish.**\nThis statement claims that the correlation energy is $0$. This is **Correct**. It provides a three-part reason:\n$1$. \"there is no electron–electron interaction in a $1$-electron system\": This is the fundamental physical reality. **Correct**.\n$2$. \"so HF is exact\": As derived above, the absence of electron-electron interaction makes the HF equation identical to the Schrödinger equation, rendering the HF solution exact (in a complete basis). **Correct**.\n$3$. \"and the CCSD cluster amplitudes vanish\": As derived above, the absence of two-electron interactions, which drive the excitations, forces all singles and doubles amplitudes to be zero. **Correct**.\nThe entire statement is a complete and accurate description of the situation.\n\n**B. $E_{\\mathrm{corr}}<0$ because CCSD captures dynamical correlation via double excitations that lower the energy even with $1$ electron.**\nThis statement claims $E_{\\mathrm{corr}}<0$. This is **Incorrect**. The correlation energy is exactly $0$. The reasoning is also flawed: \"double excitations ... even with $1$ electron\" is a physical impossibility. One cannot excite two electrons when only one is present.\n\n**C. $E_{\\mathrm{corr}}=0$ because basis set incompleteness cancels the correlation energy error in CCSD for $1$ electron.**\nThis statement claims $E_{\\mathrm{corr}}=0$, which is the correct value. However, the reasoning is entirely flawed. First, the problem explicitly posits a \"complete one-electron basis,\" so \"basis set incompleteness\" is not a factor. Second, there is no \"correlation energy error in CCSD\" for this system; CCSD is exact here. Third, the idea of a fortuitous cancellation between two unrelated error types is not a valid fundamental principle. This reasoning is nonsensical. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $E_{\\mathrm{corr}}>0$ because truncation in CCSD leads to an overestimation of correlation that raises the energy above HF for $1$ electron.**\nThis statement claims $E_{\\mathrm{corr}}>0$. By definition, for the exact ground state, $E_{\\mathrm{exact}} \\le E_{\\mathrm{HF}}$ (due to the variational principle for HF), which implies $E_{\\mathrm{corr}} = E_{\\mathrm{exact}} - E_{\\mathrm{HF}} \\le 0$. A positive correlation energy is a physical impossibility. Furthermore, the reasoning is incorrect. CCSD is not truncated for a one-electron system; it is exact. Therefore, the statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n### Conclusion\nOption A provides the correct value for the correlation energy and a completely sound and fundamental explanation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2453766"}, {"introduction": "Having established when correlation appears, we now explore how the CCSD formalism mathematically describes it.

A solution will now be derived.\n\nThe core of the problem is to translate the physical description of an electron excitation, \"$2s^2 \\rightarrow 2p^2$ promotion,\" into the language of second quantization used in the Coupled Cluster theory.\n\nThe doubles cluster operator, $\\hat{T}_2$, is a sum over all possible double excitations out of the reference determinant $|\\Phi_0\\rangle$. A single term in this sum, $\\dfrac{1}{4} t_{ij}^{ab}\\,\\hat{a}_a^{\\dagger}\\hat{a}_b^{\\dagger}\\hat{a}_j\\hat{a}_i$, corresponds to a specific double excitation. The component operators act on the reference state $|\\Phi_0\\rangle$ from right to left:\n1.  The annihilation operators $\\hat{a}_i$ and $\\hat{a}_j$ remove two electrons from the occupied spin-orbitals $i$ and $j$.\n2.  The creation operators $\\hat{a}_a^{\\dagger}$ and $\\hat{a}_b^{\\dagger}$ place two electrons into the virtual spin-orbitals $a$ and $b$.\n\nThe resulting state is a doubly excited determinant $|\\Phi_{ij}^{ab}\\rangle = \\hat{a}_a^{\\dagger}\\hat{a}_b^{\\dagger}\\hat{a}_j\\hat{a}_i |\\Phi_0\\rangle$. The numerical coefficient $t_{ij}^{ab}$ is the \"amplitude\" or weight of this particular excitation in the full Coupled Cluster wave function.\n\nThe problem specifies the excitation is from the doubly occupied $2s$ shell. In a restricted Hartree-Fock description, a doubly occupied spatial orbital like $2s$ corresponds to two spin-orbitals: one with spin $\\alpha$ ($2s_{\\alpha}$) and one with spin $\\beta$ ($2s_{\\beta}$). To excite both electrons from this shell, we must annihilate one electron from $2s_{\\alpha}$ and one from $2s_{\\beta}$. Therefore, the occupied indices $i$ and $j$ must be $2s_{\\alpha}$ and $2s_{\\beta}$.\n\nThe problem states the excitation is into the $2p$ shell. This means the electrons are placed into virtual orbitals belonging to the $2p$ set. The virtual indices $a$ and $b$ must therefore be chosen from the set of available $2p$ spin-orbitals: $\\{2p_x{}_{\\alpha}, 2p_x{}_{\\beta}, 2p_y{}_{\\alpha}, 2p_y{}_{\\beta}, 2p_z{}_{\\alpha}, 2p_z{}_{\\beta}\\}$.\n\nCombining these facts, the amplitude representing a $2s^2 \\rightarrow 2p^2$ excitation must be of the form $t_{\\,2s_{\\alpha},\\,2s_{\\beta}}^{\\,a,\\,b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are $2p$ spin-orbitals. We now evaluate each option.\n\nA. $t_{\\,2s_{\\alpha},\\,2s_{\\beta}}^{\\,2p_x{}_{\\alpha},\\,2p_x{}_{\\beta}}$\nThe lower indices, $i=2s_{\\alpha}$ and $j=2s_{\\beta}$, correctly correspond to the annihilation of the two electrons from the $2s$ shell. The upper indices, $a=2p_x{}_{\\alpha}$ and $b=2p_x{}_{\\beta}$, correspond to the creation of two electrons in the $2p_x$ spatial orbital, one with $\\alpha$ spin and one with $\\beta$ spin. This represents the specific promotion $2s^2 \\rightarrow 2p_x^2$. This is a valid instance of a $2s^2 \\rightarrow 2p^2$ promotion. Thus, this amplitude directly represents the described process.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. $t_{\\,2s_{\\alpha},\\,2s_{\\beta}}^{\\,2p_x{}_{\\alpha},\\,2p_x{}_{\\alpha}}$\nThe lower indices are correct. However, the upper indices are identical: $a=b=2p_x{}_{\\alpha}$. This would correspond to creating two electrons in the exact same spin-orbital. The Pauli Exclusion Principle forbids any state with two electrons occupying the same quantum state (spin-orbital). The creation operator sequence $\\hat{a}_{2p_x{}_{\\alpha}}^{\\dagger}\\hat{a}_{2p_x{}_{\\alpha}}^{\\dagger}$ results in zero when applied to any state. Formally, the amplitudes must obey the antisymmetry relation $t_{ij}^{ab} = -t_{ij}^{ba}$. For the case where $a=b$, this implies $t_{ij}^{aa} = -t_{ij}^{aa}$, which is only possible if $t_{ij}^{aa}=0$.

The problem explicitly describes a $2s^2 \\rightarrow 2p^2$ promotion, which originates entirely from the $2s$ shell.

Here, one of the lower indices is $2p_x{}_{\\beta}$, which is a virtual orbital. This indexing is inconsistent with the definition of the $\\hat{T}_2$ operator, where annihilated electrons must come from the occupied space of the reference determinant. An amplitude with a virtual index in an occupied-orbital slot is not defined in this context.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on this analysis, only option A correctly and physically represents an amplitude contributing to the $2s^2 \\rightarrow 2p^2$ correlation effect within the standard CCSD framework.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2453776"}, {"introduction": "A powerful computational tool can sometimes produce perplexing or even unphysical results, and a skilled practitioner must know how to interpret them.

The core of the problem is to explain an anomalous result ($E_{\\mathrm{corr}} > 0$) using the known properties of the CCSD and HF methods. The language is precise and technical. The contrast between the expectation for a \"well-behaved\" system and the actual observation is the central point to be explained, suggesting that the initial assumption of the system being \"well-behaved\" or the reference being \"adequate\" is likely false. The problem is therefore valid for analysis.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. The solution will now be derived.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\nThe Hartree–Fock method is based on the variational principle, which states that the expectation value of the Hamiltonian for any trial wavefunction, $|\\Psi_{\\mathrm{trial}}\\rangle$, is an upper bound to the true ground-state energy, $E_0$. The HF energy, $E_{\\mathrm{HF}} = \\langle \\Phi_0 | \\hat{H} | \\Phi_0 \\rangle$, is the result of minimizing this expectation value over the space of all single Slater determinants. Thus, it is guaranteed that $E_{\\mathrm{HF}} \\ge E_0$.\n\nThe exact correlation energy is defined as the difference between the exact non-relativistic ground-state energy and the Hartree-Fock limit energy: $E_{\\mathrm{corr}}^{\\mathrm{exact}} = E_0 - E_{\\mathrm{HF}}$. From the variational principle, it is a direct consequence that $E_{\\mathrm{corr}}^{\\mathrm{exact}} \\le 0$.\n\nElectron correlation methods aim to recover this correlation energy by improving upon the HF approximation. The Coupled Cluster (CC) method is one such approach. The CC wavefunction is formulated as $|\\Psi_{\\mathrm{CC}}\\rangle = e^{\\hat{T}} |\\Phi_0\\rangle$, where $|\\Phi_0\\rangle$ is the HF reference determinant and $\\hat{T}$ is the cluster operator, which creates excitations out of the reference. For CCSD, the cluster operator is truncated to single and double excitations: $\\hat{T} = \\hat{T}_1 + \\hat{T}_2$.\n\nThe CC energy is obtained by solving the projected Schrödinger equation:\n$$\n\\langle \\Phi_0 | e^{-\\hat{T}} \\hat{H} e^{\\hat{T}} | \\Phi_0 \\rangle = E_{\\mathrm{CCSD}}\n$$\nCrucially, unlike Configuration Interaction (CI) methods with full expansion, truncated CC methods such as CCSD are **not variational**. This means that the calculated CCSD energy, $E_{\\mathrm{CCSD}}$, is not guaranteed to be an upper bound to the exact ground-state energy $E_0$. While for most systems described well by a single determinant, $E_{\\mathrm{CCSD}}$ is a superb approximation to $E_0$ and is almost always lower than $E_{\\mathrm{HF}}$ (yielding $E_{\\mathrm{corr}} < 0$), there is no strict mathematical theorem that forbids $E_{\\mathrm{CCSD}}$ from being higher than $E_{\\mathrm{HF}}$.\n\nThe problem states that a calculation has resulted in $E_{\\mathrm{corr}} = E_{\\mathrm{CCSD}} - E_{\\mathrm{HF}} > 0$, which implies $E_{\\mathrm{CCSD}} > E_{\\mathrm{HF}}$. This is a pathological result. Such an outcome is a strong indicator that the fundamental assumption of the single-reference CCSD method—that the electronic state is well-described by the HF determinant $|\\Phi_0\\rangle$—is severely violated. Systems where this occurs are said to exhibit strong or static correlation. In these cases, the ground-state wavefunction is intrinsically multi-determinantal in character (e.g., during bond breaking, or for diradicals and certain open-shell transition metal complexes). Applying a single-reference method like CCSD to such a system forces it to start from a qualitatively incorrect reference. The non-variational nature of the method can then lead to unphysical results, including an energy that is higher than the reference energy. Other symptoms of a poor reference include HF instabilities (e.g., RHF/UHF instability, where a lower-energy solution of broken symmetry exists) or very large T1 and/or T2 diagnostic values. The observation $E_{\\mathrm{corr}} > 0$ is a definitive sign that the reference is inadequate.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The single-determinant HF reference is qualitatively inadequate for the target state (for example, the system has significant static correlation or the HF solution is unstable or symmetry-broken), so the non-variational CCSD built on that reference can yield $E_{\\mathrm{corr}} > 0$.**\nThis statement correctly identifies the core reason for the anomalous result. It links the qualitatively inadequate HF reference (due to static correlation or instabilities) to the non-variational nature of CCSD. As derived above, when the single-reference ansatz is fundamentally flawed, the non-variational CC procedure can produce unphysical energies, including $E_{\\mathrm{CCSD}} > E_{\\mathrm{HF}}$. This is the textbook explanation for such a finding.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The one-electron basis set is sufficiently large that electron correlation is fully captured at the HF level, so any post-HF method must produce a positive $E_{\\mathrm{corr}}$.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. The Hartree-Fock method, by its very definition, does not capture electron correlation (it treats electron-electron repulsion in an average way). The correlation energy is what is *missing* from the HF model. A large basis set only allows the calculation to approach the Hartree-Fock limit, which is the best possible energy within the single-determinant approximation. It does not incorporate the dynamic or static correlation effects. The premise is a contradiction in terms.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. CCSD is not size-extensive for this system, and the lack of size-extensivity manifests as an increase in energy above the HF value.**\nThis statement is based on a false premise. A major theoretical advantage of all truncated coupled cluster methods, including CCSD, is that they are rigorously size-extensive. Size-extensivity ensures that the energy of a system of $N$ non-interacting identical molecules is exactly $N$ times the energy of a single molecule. It is truncated configuration interaction methods (like CISD) that suffer from a lack of size-extensivity. The observed outcome, $E_{\\mathrm{corr}} > 0$, is not a manifestation of a lack of size-extensivity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Because of the variational principle, the HF energy is already lower than the exact ground-state energy, so correlated methods like CCSD are expected to increase the energy relative to HF.**\nThis statement contains two major errors. First, it misstates the variational principle. The HF energy, $E_{\\mathrm{HF}}$, is an *upper bound* to the exact ground-state energy, $E_0$, meaning $E_{\\mathrm{HF}} \\ge E_0$. It is not lower. Second, because $E_{\\mathrm{HF}}$ is an upper bound, electron correlation methods are designed to recover the correlation energy and thus *lower* the total energy from $E_{\\mathrm{HF}}$ towards $E_0$. The expectation is that $E_{\\mathrm{corr}} < 0$. This statement claims the opposite.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The HF orbitals are Brueckner orbitals, so all single-excitation amplitudes vanish, implying zero correlation energy rather than a positive one.**\nThis statement is incorrect. If the HF orbitals happen to be Brueckner orbitals, it means that the single-excitation amplitudes, $t_1$, connecting the reference determinant to singly-excited determinants vanish ($t_1 = 0$). This defines the Brueckner doubles coupled cluster (BD) method. However, the correlation energy is not solely dependent on single excitations. The double-excitation cluster operator, $\\hat{T}_2$, would still contribute to the energy. The correlation energy in the BD method is primarily from the double excitations, and it is not expected to be zero. Furthermore, the problem reports a *positive* correlation energy, not a zero one. The premise does not lead to the specified observation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2453782"}]}
