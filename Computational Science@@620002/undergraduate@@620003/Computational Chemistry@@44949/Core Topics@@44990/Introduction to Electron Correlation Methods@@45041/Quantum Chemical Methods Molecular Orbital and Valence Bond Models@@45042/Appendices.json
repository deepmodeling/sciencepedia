The central atom $X$ has an effective valence configuration of $p^2$. According to Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity, the ground state of an atom with two electrons in three degenerate $p$ orbitals will have the electrons in different orbitals with parallel spins. We can represent this configuration as, for example, $p_x^1 p_y^1 p_z^0$. Thus, atom $X$ has two half-filled $p$ orbitals available for bonding.\n2.  Each hydrogen atom has a $1s^1$ configuration, providing one half-filled $1s$ orbital.\n3.  To form the $\\mathrm{XH_2}$ molecule, two covalent $\\sigma$ bonds must be formed. This is achieved by the overlap of the two half-filled $p$ orbitals of $X$ with the half-filled $1s$ orbitals of the two hydrogen atoms.\n    -   One $X-H$ bond forms from the overlap of the $X(p_x)$ orbital and the $H_A(1s)$ orbital.\n    -   The second $X-H$ bond forms from the overlap of the $X(p_y)$ orbital and the $H_B(1s)$ orbital.\n4.  The geometry of the molecule is determined by the spatial orientation of the atomic orbitals that maximize overlap. The $p_x$ and $p_y$ orbitals are orthogonal, meaning the angle between their primary axes is exactly $90^\\circ$. To maximize the overlap for both bonds simultaneously, the hydrogen atoms must be located along the $x$ and $y$ axes, respectively.\n5.  This leads to a direct prediction of a bent molecular geometry with an $H\\text{-}X\\text{-}H$ bond angle of $90^\\circ$. The third $p$ orbital on atom $X$, the $p_z$ orbital, was not involved in bonding and remains empty and nonbonding.\n\n**Analysis via Molecular Orbital (MO) Theory**\n\nWe construct a qualitative MO diagram for $\\mathrm{XH_2}$ using only the valence $p$ orbitals of $X$ and $1s$ orbitals of the two $H$ atoms. The total number of valence electrons is $2$ (from $X$) $+ 2 \\times 1$ (from H) $= 4$. We analyze the stability of linear vs. bent geometries by constructing a simple Walsh diagram.\n\n1.  **Linear Geometry ($D_{\\infty h}$)**: Let the molecular axis be $z$.\n    -   The atomic orbitals of $X$ are $p_z$ ($\\sigma_u$ symmetry) and the degenerate pair $(p_x, p_y)$ ($\\pi_u$ symmetry).\n    -   The symmetry-adapted linear combinations (SALCs) of the $H(1s)$ orbitals are $\\sigma_g = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1s_A + 1s_B)$ and $\\sigma_u = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1s_A - 1s_B)$.\n    -   The $X(p_z)$ orbital mixes with the hydrogen $\\sigma_u$ SALC to form a bonding MO ($1\\sigma_u$) and an antibonding MO ($2\\sigma_u^*$).\n    -   The $X(p_x, p_y)$ orbitals are nonbonding ($1\\pi_u$) as there are no hydrogen SALCs of $\\pi_u$ symmetry.\n    -   The hydrogen $\\sigma_g$ SALC is also nonbonding as there is no available central atom orbital of $\\sigma_g$ symmetry (the $s$ orbital is forbidden).\n    -   For a total of $4$ electrons, the electronic configuration is $(1\\sigma_u)^2(1\\pi_u)^2$ if $E(\\pi_u) < E(\\sigma_g)$, or $(1\\sigma_u)^2(\\sigma_g)^2$ if $E(\\sigma_g) < E(\\pi_u)$. In the first case, this is a triplet diradical or subject to Jahn-Teller distortion. In the second case, only two electrons are in an $X\\text{-}H$ bonding orbital. Both situations are less than optimal for forming a stable molecule with two bonds.\n\n2.  **Bent Geometry ($C_{2v}$)**: Let the molecule lie in the $yz$-plane with the $z$-axis as the $C_2$ axis.\n    -   The atomic orbitals of $X$ are $p_z$ ($a_1$), $p_y$ ($b_2$), and $p_x$ ($b_1$).\n    -   The hydrogen SALCs are now of $a_1$ and $b_2$ symmetry.\n    -   The $X(p_z)$ orbital mixes with the $a_1$ SALC to form a bonding MO ($1a_1$) and an antibonding MO ($2a_1^*$).\n    -   The $X(p_y)$ orbital mixes with the $b_2$ SALC to form a bonding MO ($1b_2$) and an antibonding MO ($2b_2^*$).\n    -   The $X(p_x)$ orbital remains nonbonding ($1b_1$) as there is no SALC of $b_1$ symmetry.\n    -   The resulting MOs are two bonding orbitals ($1a_1, 1b_2$), one nonbonding orbital ($1b_1$), and two antibonding orbitals. The $4$ valence electrons will occupy the two lowest-energy orbitals, which are the bonding MOs.\n    -   The electronic configuration is $(1a_1)^2(1b_2)^2$.\n\n3.  **Comparison**: The bent geometry places all four valence electrons into two strongly bonding molecular orbitals, resulting in a stable molecule with two distinct $X\\text{-}H$ bonds (formally, a bond order of $2$). The linear geometry is significantly less stable. MO theory thus strongly favors a bent structure. The energetic minimum with respect to the bond angle, in the absence of contributions from an $s$ orbital, is expected to be near the angle that optimizes the overlap of the pure $p$ orbitals, which is $90^\\circ$.\n\nBoth VB and MO theories converge on the same prediction: a bent $\\mathrm{XH_2}$ molecule with an $H\\text{-}X\\text{-}H$ bond angle of approximately $90^\\circ$, formed from two pure $p$ orbitals of $X$.\n\n**Evaluation of the Provided Options**\n\n*   **A.

The four $1s$ atomic orbitals $\\{\\phi_1, \\phi_2, \\phi_3, \\phi_4\\}$ form the basis. The molecular orbital energies for a cyclic $N=4$ system are given by the general formula $E_k = \\alpha + 2\\beta \\cos(2\\pi k / N)$, where $\\alpha$ is the Coulomb integral (orbital energy), $\\beta$ is the resonance integral (interaction energy, $\\beta < 0$), and $k=0, \\pm 1, 2$.\n\nThe resulting energy levels are:\n-   $k=0$: $E_1 = \\alpha + 2\\beta \\cos(0) = \\alpha + 2\\beta$. This is a single, strongly bonding MO of $a_{1g}$ symmetry.\n-   $k=\\pm 1$: $E_{2,3} = \\alpha + 2\\beta \\cos(\\pm \\pi/2) = \\alpha$. This is a doubly degenerate pair of non-bonding MOs of $e_u$ symmetry.\n-   $k=2$: $E_4 = \\alpha + 2\\beta \\cos(\\pi) = \\alpha - 2\\beta$. This is a single, strongly anti-bonding MO of $b_{1g}$ symmetry.\n\nThere are $4$ valence electrons to place in these orbitals. Two electrons fill the lowest bonding orbital ($a_{1g}$). The remaining two electrons must occupy the doubly degenerate non-bonding orbitals ($e_u$). This configuration corresponds to a partially filled, degenerate Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO), which is the definition of the Fermi level in this context.\n\nAccording to the Jahn-Teller theorem, any non-linear molecule in an electronically degenerate state is unstable and will undergo a geometric distortion to remove the degeneracy and lower its energy. For square $H_4$, this implies a first-order Jahn-Teller distortion from the $D_{4h}$ square geometry to a more stable $D_{2h}$ rectangular geometry, where opposite bonds become non-equivalent (two short, two long).\n\nThe total electronic energy of the square $H_4$ is $E_{MO}(H_4) = 2(\\alpha+2\\beta) + 2(\\alpha) = 4\\alpha + 4\\beta$.\nFor comparison, a single $H_2$ molecule has one bonding orbital of energy $\\alpha+\\beta$ and one anti-bonding orbital of energy $\\alpha-\\beta$. Its two electrons occupy the bonding orbital, giving a total energy of $E(H_2) = 2(\\alpha+\\beta)$. Two separated $H_2$ molecules therefore have a total energy of $E(2H_2) = 2 \\times [2(\\alpha+\\beta)] = 4\\alpha + 4\\beta$.\nWithin this model, the square $H_4$ possesses no delocalization stabilization energy relative to two isolated $H_2$ molecules. The inherent instability predicted by the Jahn-Teller theorem means the square geometry is not a minimum on the potential energy surface. The system is predicted to be unstable.\n\n**Valence Bond Theory Analysis**\nIn the VB model, we consider two primary covalent resonance structures:\n-   Structure I ($\\Psi_I$): Covalent bonds between $H_1-H_2$ and $H_3-H_4$. This corresponds to a rectangular arrangement of two $H_2$ units.\n-   Structure II ($\\Psi_{II}$): Covalent bonds between $H_2-H_3$ and $H_4-H_1$.\n\nThe ground state is a superposition of these two structures, $\\Psi = c_I\\Psi_I + c_{II}\\Psi_{II}$. The stabilization gained from mixing these structures is the resonance energy. For cyclic systems with $4n$ electrons (here $n=1$), which are termed \"anti-aromatic,\" the resonance interaction between the principal covalent structures is known to be very weak, or even destabilizing. Consequently, there is little to no stabilization gained by delocalizing the electrons over the entire ring. The system prefers to localize its bonds, meaning one of the two rectangular structures, $\\Psi_I$ or $\\Psi_{II}$, is a better description of the ground state than the symmetric superposition corresponding to the square. This preference for localization also implies that the symmetric square is unstable and will distort into a rectangle. The stability of such a localized structure is essentially that of two interacting $H_2$ molecules, which is comparable to, or less stable than, two non-interacting $H_2$ molecules due to Pauli repulsion between the bond pairs.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\nA. The MO model predicts pronounced delocalization stabilization of the symmetric square relative to two separated $H_2$ molecules, and the VB model predicts additional stabilization from resonance between the two covalent pairing structures; therefore the square should be unusually stable and resistant to distortion.\n**Incorrect**.
