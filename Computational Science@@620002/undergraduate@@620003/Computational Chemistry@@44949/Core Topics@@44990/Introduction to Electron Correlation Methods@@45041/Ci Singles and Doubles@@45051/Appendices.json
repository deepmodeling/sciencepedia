It is based on fundamental concepts of quantum chemistry: the hydrogen atom, the Hartree-Fock method, and Configuration Interaction theory. The number of electrons, the Hamiltonian, and the basis set context are all specified without ambiguity. The problem does not violate any scientific principles, is not based on false premises, and contains sufficient information for a rigorous derivation. The question is objective and its solution is verifiable through the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. The solution will now be derived.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe nonrelativistic electronic Hamiltonian for an $N_{e}$-electron system is given by:\n$$\n\\hat{H} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{e}} \\hat{h}(i) + \\sum_{i<j}^{N_{e}} \\frac{1}{r_{ij}}\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{h}(i) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla_i^2 - \\frac{Z}{r_i}$ is the one-electron operator (kinetic energy and nuclear attraction), and the second term is the two-electron repulsion operator.\n\nFor the hydrogen atom, the number of electrons is $N_{e}=1$ and the nuclear charge is $Z=1$. The sum over pairs of electrons, $\\sum_{i<j}$, is empty. Therefore, the exact electronic Hamiltonian for the hydrogen atom consists only of the one-electron operator:\n$$\n\\hat{H} = \\hat{h}(1) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla_1^2 - \\frac{1}{r_1}\n$$\nThere is no electron-electron interaction term.\n\nNow, let us consider the Hartree–Fock (HF) method. The HF equations are derived by applying the variational principle to a single Slater determinant wavefunction. The resulting equations for the canonical spin-orbitals $\\phi_k$ are:\n$$\n\\hat{f} \\phi_k = \\epsilon_k \\phi_k\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{f}$ is the Fock operator and $\\epsilon_k$ are the orbital energies. The Fock operator is defined as:\n$$\n\\hat{f}(i) = \\hat{h}(i) + \\sum_{j=1}^{N_{e}} (\\hat{J}_j(i) - \\hat{K}_j(i))\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{J}_j$ and $\\hat{K}_j$ are the Coulomb and exchange operators, respectively, which represent the average interaction with the other electrons. For a one-electron system ($N_{e}=1$), the sum over other electrons is empty. Thus, the Coulomb and exchange terms vanish. The Fock operator becomes identical to the one-electron Hamiltonian:\n$$\n\\hat{f} = \\hat{h} = \\hat{H}\n$$\nConsequently, the Roothaan-Hall equations (the matrix form of the HF equations in a finite basis) are equivalent to solving the exact Schrödinger equation within the space spanned by the one-electron basis functions. The HF orbitals $\\{\\phi_k\\}$ are the exact eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ within the given basis, and the orbital energies $\\{\\epsilon_k\\}$ are the corresponding eigenvalues.\n\nThe HF ground-state wavefunction, $\\Psi_{HF}$, is the single determinant formed from the lowest-energy occupied orbital, $\\phi_1$. The HF energy is:\n$$\nE_{HF} = \\langle \\Psi_{HF} | \\hat{H} | \\Psi_{HF} \\rangle = \\langle \\phi_1 | \\hat{H} | \\phi_1 \\rangle = \\epsilon_1\n$$\nThe exact ground-state energy in the given basis, $E_{exact}$, is the lowest eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian matrix in that basis. As established, this is precisely $\\epsilon_1$. Therefore, for a one-electron system:\n$$\nE_{HF} = E_{exact}\n$$\n\nNext, we analyze the CISD method. The CISD wavefunction is constructed as a linear combination of the HF reference determinant ($\\Psi_0 \\equiv \\Psi_{HF}$), all singly-excited determinants ($\\Psi_i^a$), and all doubly-excited determinants ($\\Psi_{ij}^{ab}$):\n$$\n\\Psi_{CISD} = c_0 \\Psi_0 + \\sum_{i,a} c_i^a \\Psi_i^a + \\sum_{i<j, a<b} c_{ij}^{ab} \\Psi_{ij}^{ab}\n$$\nFor a system with $N_e=1$, it is impossible to excite two electrons. The set of doubly-excited determinants is empty. The CISD method, therefore, reduces to the Configuration Interaction Singles (CIS) method:\n$$\n\\Psi_{CISD} = \\Psi_{CIS} = c_0 \\Psi_0 + \\sum_{a} c_1^a \\Psi_1^a\n$$\nThe CISD ground-state energy is found by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix in the basis of configurations $\\{\\Psi_0, \\Psi_1^a, \\Psi_1^b, \\dots\\}$. The off-diagonal matrix elements between the HF reference and any singly-excited determinant are given by Brillouin's theorem. For a general multi-electron system, these elements are zero for canonical HF orbitals: $\\langle \\Psi_0 | \\hat{H} | \\Psi_i^a \\rangle = 0$. For our $N_e=1$ system, this is trivially true and requires no cancellation between one- and two-electron terms, as the latter do not exist.\n$$\n\\langle \\Psi_0 | \\hat{H} | \\Psi_1^a \\rangle = \\langle \\phi_1 | \\hat{H} | \\phi_a \\rangle\n$$\nSince the HF orbitals $\\{\\phi_k\\}$ are eigenfunctions of $\\hat{H}$ (i.e., $\\hat{H}\\phi_k = \\epsilon_k\\phi_k$), we have:\n$$\n\\langle \\phi_1 | \\hat{H} | \\phi_a \\rangle = \\langle \\phi_1 | \\epsilon_a \\phi_a \\rangle = \\epsilon_a \\langle \\phi_1 | \\phi_a \\rangle = 0\n$$\nbecause the orbitals are orthonormal ($\\langle \\phi_1 | \\phi_a \\rangle = 0$ for $a \\neq 1$).\n\nThis shows that the CI matrix is diagonal. The ground state does not mix with any of the single excitations. The eigenvalues of the CI matrix are simply the energies of the individual configurations, which are the orbital energies $\\{\\epsilon_k\\}$. The lowest eigenvalue is $\\epsilon_1$, which is the HF energy.\n$$\nE_{CISD} = E_{HF}\n$$\nCombining our findings, we conclude that for a one-electron system in a finite basis:\n$$\nE_{CISD} = E_{HF} = E_{exact}\n$$\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. The CISD ground-state energy equals the Hartree–Fock energy and also equals the exact nonrelativistic energy achievable in the chosen one-electron basis, because with $N_{e}=1$ there is no electron–electron interaction and no double excitations exist.**\nThis statement is fully consistent with our derivation. The equality $E_{CISD} = E_{HF} = E_{exact}$ is correct. The reasoning provided is also correct: the absence of electron-electron interaction makes the HF solution exact within the basis, and the absence of double excitations for $N_e=1$ is a fact that simplifies the CISD problem.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The CISD ground-state energy is lower than Hartree–Fock because single excitations capture orbital relaxation even for $N_{e}=1$.**\nThis is incorrect. As shown by the vanishing matrix elements $\\langle \\Psi_0 | \\hat{H} | \\Psi_1^a \\rangle = 0$, single excitations do not mix with the HF ground state. Therefore, they cannot lower the energy. The CISD energy is equal to, not lower than, the HF energy. The concept of \"orbital relaxation\" via singles is not applicable to the ground state energy calculation in this specific single-electron case, as the HF orbitals are already the exact eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. CISD is undefined for hydrogen because doubles are required to construct the Configuration Interaction (CI) space, and with $N_{e}=1$ no such doubles can be formed.**\nThis is incorrect. A method is not \"undefined\" if a subset of its basis functions is an empty set. The CISD method is perfectly well-defined; for $N_e=1$, it simply reduces to CIS. The assertion that doubles are \"required to construct the Configuration Interaction (CI) space\" is false; any selection of excitations can define a CI space.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. CISD produces the same energy as Configuration Interaction Singles (CIS), but both are strictly higher in energy than Hartree–Fock due to lack of size consistency, even for $N_{e}=1$.**\nThis statement contains multiple errors. While it is true that for $N_e=1$, CISD produces the same energy as CIS, it is false that this energy is strictly higher than Hartree-Fock. It is equal to the HF energy. Furthermore, invoking \"lack of size consistency\" as a justification is nonsensical. Size consistency relates to the treatment of non-interacting subsystems, a concept not applicable to a single atom. Also, lack of size consistency does not imply that the energy must be higher than HF; truncated CI is always variational with respect to the full CI limit.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2452148"}, {"introduction": "Having established the conceptual purpose of CISD, we now turn to the practical construction of the CI wavefunction.

The calculation is performed in a basis of spin orbitals, without spin adaptation.\n\nFirst, we establish the dimensions of the orbital space. The system is a water molecule with $N_{e}=10$ electrons. The calculation is performed in a minimal STO-3G basis, which results in $M=7$ spatial molecular orbitals (MOs). The reference state $\\lvert \\Phi_{0} \\rangle$ is a Restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) closed-shell determinant, where the $N_{e}=10$ electrons doubly occupy the $n_{\\text{occ}}^{\\text{spatial}} = \\frac{N_{e}}{2} = 5$ lowest-energy spatial MOs.

In second quantization, this is represented by applying the operator combination $a_{a}^{\\dagger} a_{i}$ to the reference determinant $\\lvert \\Phi_{0} \\rangle$. Each distinct pair $(i, a)$ yields a unique singly excited determinant.

This is represented by the operator $a_{a}^{\\dagger} a_{b}^{\\dagger} a_{j} a_{i}$. Due to the fermionic nature of electrons, the creation and annihilation operators anti-commute. For example, $a_{a}^{\\dagger} a_{b}^{\\dagger} = -a_{b}^{\\dagger} a_{a}^{\\dagger}$ and $a_{j} a_{i} = -a_{i} a_{j}$. Consequently, the determinant $\\lvert \\Phi_{ij}^{ab} \\rangle = a_{a}^{\\dagger} a_{b}^{\\dagger} a_{j} a_{i} \\lvert \\Phi_{0} \\rangle$ is unique only up to a sign with respect to the ordering of indices. The problem specifies that determinants differing only by such a sign are to be considered the same. This means we are counting the number of unique ways to choose two occupied spin orbitals and two virtual spin orbitals. To represent this set symbolically without redundancy, we impose a strict ordering on the indices, for instance, $i<j$ and $a<b$, where the inequality refers to the integer labels assigned to the spin orbitals.

The total ionic weight, $w_{\\mathrm{ionic}}$, is the sum of the squared moduli of the coefficients multiplying these ionic determinants in the normalized expansion of $|\\Psi\\rangle$.\nUpon expressing the spatial part $\\Psi(1,2)$ as a linear combination of orthonormal atomic-orbital-based functions, which include the ionic functions $\\chi_A(1)\\chi_A(2)$ and $\\chi_B(1)\\chi_B(2)$, we observe that the coefficients of these ionic functions are precisely zero.\n\nTherefore, the total ionic weight is:\n$$\nw_{\\mathrm{ionic}} = 0^2 + 0^2 = 0\n$$\nThis result demonstrates a crucial success of configuration interaction methods: unlike the restricted Hartree-Fock approximation which incorrectly predicts $50\\%$ ionic character at dissociation, the multi-reference CISD (or Full CI in this case) correctly describes the dissociation of $\\mathrm{H}_2$ into two neutral, non-interacting hydrogen atoms, a purely covalent situation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "2452181"}]}
