While the RRHO approximation is standard for polyatomic molecules, its application to a monatomic species represents a limiting case. A single atom possesses $3$ degrees of freedom, which are all translational. It possesses no internal structure that could give rise to vibrations or rotations.\n-   **Vibrational Contribution**: The harmonic oscillator model describes the vibrations of chemical bonds. A single atom has no bonds, and thus no vibrational modes. The number of vibrational normal modes for a molecule of $N$ atoms is $3N-6$ (for nonlinear molecules) or $3N-5$ (for linear molecules). For $N=1$, these formulae are not applicable, and more fundamentally, there are no internal coordinates that can vibrate.\n-   **Rotational Contribution**: The rigid rotor model describes the rotation of a body with non-zero moments of inertia. A single atom, being a point mass, has zero moment of inertia about any axis passing through its center.\nThe problem is not scientifically unsound. It is a valid, if subtle, test of the applicability of the RRHO model, where the vibrational and rotational contributions must correctly be identified as zero. The problem is well-posed, self-contained, and all data required for the calculation of the translational entropy are provided.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe molar entropy $S$ is derived from the molecular partition function $q$ using the formula $S = R(\\ln(q/N_A) + 1) + U/T$, where $U$ is the internal energy. For an ideal gas, the total partition function is a product of contributions: $q = q_{\\mathrm{trans}} q_{\\mathrm{rot}} q_{\\mathrm{vib}} q_{\\mathrm{el}}$. The entropy is correspondingly a sum of contributions: $S = S_{\\mathrm{trans}} + S_{\\mathrm{rot}} + S_{\\mathrm{vib}} + S_{\\mathrm{el}}$. The problem specifies a nondegenerate electronic ground state, which means the electronic partition function $q_{\\mathrm{el}} = 1$ and therefore the electronic entropy contribution $S_{\\mathrm{el}} = R \\ln q_{\\mathrm{el}} = 0$.\n\n**Vibrational Molar Entropy ($S_{\\mathrm{vib}}$)**\nA helium atom has only one nucleus ($N=1$) and no chemical bonds. Consequently, it has no vibrational degrees of freedom. The vibrational partition function $q_{\\mathrm{vib}}$ is therefore unity.\n$$q_{\\mathrm{vib}} = 1$$\nThe molar vibrational entropy is given by $S_{\\mathrm{vib}} = R \\left( \\ln q_{\\mathrm{vib}} + T \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\ln q_{\\mathrm{vib}}}{\\partial T} \\right)_V \\right)$. With $q_{\\mathrm{vib}} = 1$, we have $\\ln q_{\\mathrm{vib}} = 0$.\n$$S_{\\mathrm{vib}} = 0$$\n\n**Rotational Molar Entropy ($S_{\\mathrm{rot}}$)**\nA helium atom is spherically symmetric. In quantum mechanics, it is treated as a point mass. The moment of inertia $I$ about its center of mass is zero. The rotational energy levels are given by $E_J = \\frac{\\hbar^2 J(J+1)}{2I}$. For $I \\to 0$, the energy spacing between levels becomes infinite. Only the ground state with rotational quantum number $J=0$ is accessible at any finite temperature. The rotational partition function is sum over states $g_J \\exp(-E_J/k_B T)$, which reduces to the degeneracy of the ground state. For a single atom, the ground rotational state is nondegenerate, so $q_{\\mathrm{rot}} = 1$. The nuclear spin contribution is conventionally ignored unless specified.\n$$q_{\\mathrm{rot}} = 1$$\nSimilar to the vibrational case, with $q_{\\mathrm{rot}} = 1$, the molar rotational entropy $S_{\\mathrm{rot}}$ is zero.\n$$S_{\\mathrm{rot}} = 0$$\n\n**Translational Molar Entropy ($S_{\\mathrm{trans}}$)**\nThe translational motion is the only contribution to the entropy for a monatomic ideal gas, aside from electronic and nuclear spin contributions. The molar translational entropy is given by the Sackur-Tetrode equation:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{trans}} = R \\left[ \\ln\\left( \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi m k_B T}{h^2} \\right)^{3/2} \\frac{k_B T}{p} \\right) + \\frac{5}{2} \\right]$$\nWe must now substitute the given values.\nFirst, the mass of a single helium atom in SI units:\n$$m = 4.002602 \\ \\mathrm{u} \\times 1.66053906660 \\times 10^{-27} \\ \\mathrm{kg/u} = 6.64647634 \\times 10^{-27} \\ \\mathrm{kg}$$\nNow we compute the argument of the logarithm. Let us define a dimensionless quantity $\\mathcal{A}$:\n$$\\mathcal{A} = \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi m k_B T}{h^2} \\right)^{3/2} \\frac{k_B T}{p}$$\nSubstituting the constants:\n- $m = 6.64647634 \\times 10^{-27}$ kg\n- $T = 298.15$ K\n- $p = 1.01325 \\times 10^{5}$ Pa\n- $h = 6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}$ J s\n- $k_B = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}$ J K$^{-1}$\n\nThe term $\\frac{2 \\pi m k_B T}{h^2}$ evaluates to:\n$$\\frac{2 \\pi (6.64647634 \\times 10^{-27}) (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}) (298.15)}{(6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34})^2} \\approx 3.90886 \\times 10^{20} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2}$$\nThe term $\\frac{k_B T}{p}$ evaluates to:\n$$\\frac{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}) (298.15)}{1.01325 \\times 10^{5}} \\approx 4.06253 \\times 10^{-26} \\ \\mathrm{m}^3$$\nNow, we calculate $\\mathcal{A}$:\n$$\\mathcal{A} \\approx (3.90886 \\times 10^{20})^{3/2} \\times (4.06253 \\times 10^{-26}) \\approx (7.73920 \\times 10^{30}) \\times (4.06253 \\times 10^{-26}) \\approx 3.14414 \\times 10^5$$\nThe natural logarithm of this value is:\n$$\\ln(\\mathcal{A}) \\approx \\ln(3.14414 \\times 10^5) \\approx 12.6586$$\nFinally, we calculate $S_{\\mathrm{trans}}$:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{trans}} = R \\left( \\ln(\\mathcal{A}) + \\frac{5}{2} \\right) \\approx 8.314462618 \\ \\mathrm{J \\ mol^{-1} \\ K^{-1}} \\times \\left( 12.6586 + 2.5 \\right)$$\n$$S_{\\mathrm{trans}} \\approx 8.314462618 \\times 15.1586 \\approx 126.039 \\ \\mathrm{J \\ mol^{-1} \\ K^{-1}}$$\nThe problem requires rounding each component to four significant figures. For $S_{\\mathrm{vib}}$ and $S_{\\mathrm{rot}}$, the values are exactly zero based on the model, so the concept of significant figures for a measurement does not strictly apply. We will report them as $0.0$. For $S_{\\mathrm{trans}}$, rounding $126.039$ to four significant figures gives $126.0$.\n\nThe three molar entropy contributions are therefore:\n$S_{\\mathrm{vib}} = 0.0$ J mol$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$\n$S_{\\mathrm{rot}} = 0.0$ J mol$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$\n$S_{\\mathrm{trans}} = 126.0$ J mol$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.0 & 0.0 & 126.0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2451702"}, {"introduction": "Moving from foundational concepts to constructive application, this practice challenges you to build a complete thermodynamic model from first principles.

All required data and constants are provided, and the assumptions are clearly stated and physically reasonable for the specified system and temperature range.

Translational Contribution ($C_{v,\\mathrm{trans}}$)**\nFor an ideal gas, the translational motion in three-dimensional space corresponds to three quadratic degrees of freedom. According to the equipartition theorem, each translational degree of freedom contributes $\\frac{1}{2}k_\\mathrm{B}T$ to the average energy per molecule. The total molar translational energy is therefore:\n$$U_{\\mathrm{trans}} = N_\\mathrm{A} \\left(3 \\times \\frac{1}{2}k_\\mathrm{B}T\\right) = \\frac{3}{2}RT$$\nThe translational contribution to the molar heat capacity at constant volume is the derivative of the internal energy with respect to temperature:\n$$C_{v,\\mathrm{trans}} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial U_{\\mathrm{trans}}}{\\partial T}\\right)_V = \\frac{3}{2}R$$\nThis contribution is constant with respect to temperature.\n\n**2. Rotational Contribution ($C_{v,\\mathrm{rot}}$)**\nThe nitrogen molecule, $N_2$, is a linear molecule. In the classical limit (which is valid for $T \\ge 10\\ \\mathrm{K}$ as the rotational temperature of $N_2$ is approximately $2.88\\ \\mathrm{K}$), there are two rotational degrees of freedom, corresponding to rotation about two axes perpendicular to the internuclear axis. Applying the equipartition theorem again, the molar rotational energy is:\n$$U_{\\mathrm{rot}} = N_\\mathrm{A} \\left(2 \\times \\frac{1}{2}k_\\mathrm{B}T\\right) = RT$$\nThe rotational contribution to the molar heat capacity is consequently:\n$$C_{v,\\mathrm{rot}} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial U_{\\mathrm{rot}}}{\\partial T}\\right)_V = R$$\nThis contribution is also constant with respect to temperature under the given assumptions.\n\n**3. Vibrational Contribution ($C_{v,\\mathrm{vib}}$)**\nThe vibrational motion must be treated quantum mechanically, as the vibrational energy spacing for $N_2$ is large. We model the single vibrational mode as a quantum harmonic oscillator. The energy levels are given by $E_n = (n + 1/2)h\\nu$ for $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$, where $\\nu$ is the fundamental vibrational frequency. The frequency $\\nu$ is related to the given wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$ by $\\nu = c\\tilde{\\nu}$.\n\nThe molecular vibrational partition function $q_{\\mathrm{vib}}$ is the sum over all vibrational states:\n$$q_{\\mathrm{vib}}(T) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} e^{-E_n / (k_\\mathrm{B}T)} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} e^{-(n+1/2)h\\nu / (k_\\mathrm{B}T)} = e^{-h\\nu / (2k_\\mathrm{B}T)} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\left(e^{-h\\nu / (k_\\mathrm{B}T)}\\right)^n$$\nThis is a geometric series which converges to:\n$$q_{\\mathrm{vib}}(T) = \\frac{e^{-h\\nu / (2k_\\mathrm{B}T)}}{1 - e^{-h\\nu / (k_\\mathrm{B}T)}}$$\nThe molar vibrational internal energy $U_{\\mathrm{vib}}$ is related to the partition function by:\n$$U_{\\mathrm{vib}}(T) = N_\\mathrm{A} k_\\mathrm{B} T^2 \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\ln q_{\\mathrm{vib}}}{\\partial T}\\right)_V$$\nSubstituting $q_{\\mathrm{vib}}$ and differentiating yields:\n$$U_{\\mathrm{vib}}(T) = N_\\mathrm{A} \\left(\\frac{h\\nu}{2} + \\frac{h\\nu}{e^{h\\nu/(k_\\mathrm{B}T)} - 1}\\right)$$\nThe molar vibrational heat capacity is the derivative of $U_{\\mathrm{vib}}$ with respect to $T$. The zero-point energy term $N_\\mathrm{A} h\\nu/2$ is constant and does not contribute.\n$$C_{v,\\mathrm{vib}}(T) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial U_{\\mathrm{vib}}}{\\partial T}\\right)_V = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\left(\\frac{N_\\mathrm{A} h\\nu}{e^{h\\nu/(k_\\mathrm{B}T)} - 1}\\right)$$\nIt is convenient to define a characteristic vibrational temperature, $\\Theta_{\\mathrm{vib}} = h\\nu/k_\\mathrm{B} = hc\\tilde{\\nu}/k_\\mathrm{B}$.\n$$C_{v,\\mathrm{vib}}(T) = R \\left(\\frac{\\Theta_{\\mathrm{vib}}}{T}\\right)^2 \\frac{e^{\\Theta_{\\mathrm{vib}}/T}}{\\left(e^{\\Theta_{\\mathrm{vib}}/T} - 1\\right)^2}$$\nThis contribution is strongly dependent on temperature.

Calculation of $T_\\mathrm{sig}$**\nThe second task is to find the temperature $T_\\mathrm{sig}$ where the vibrational contribution reaches $5\\%$ of its classical limit, $R$.

A stationary point with one imaginary frequency is the definition of a first-order saddle point, which is correctly identified with a transition state in chemical reaction theory.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The question asks for the physical interpretation of a specific calculated quantity under well-defined theoretical assumptions.

The existence of one imaginary frequency is correctly linked to a single negative Hessian eigenvalue and a non-confining potential.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation and Evaluation**\n\nThe problem concerns the thermodynamic properties of a molecular geometry that is a first-order saddle point on the potential energy surface, as indicated by the presence of exactly one imaginary frequency. Such a point is not a stable minimum but represents a transition state for a chemical reaction.\n\nThe total canonical partition function, $Z$, under the assumption of separability of degrees of freedom, is a product of translational, rotational, vibrational, and electronic partition functions:\n$$Z = z_{\\text{trans}} z_{\\text{rot}} z_{\\text{vib}} z_{\\text{elec}}$$\nThe entropy, $S$, is derived from $Z$ via the Helmholtz free energy, $A = -k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\ln Z$:\n$$S = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial T}\\right)_{V,N} = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln Z + k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\ln Z}{\\partial T}\\right)_{V,N}$$\nOur focus is on the vibrational contribution, $z_{\\text{vib}}$, which is a product of partition functions for each normal mode, $z_i$:\n$$z_{\\text{vib}} = \\prod_{i} z_i$$\nFor a harmonic oscillator with a real frequency $\\nu_i > 0$ (corresponding to a Hessian eigenvalue $\\lambda_i > 0$), the potential is confining, $V_i = \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda_i Q_i^2$, and the classical partition function for that mode is a convergent Gaussian integral. The quantum mechanical partition function is also well-defined:\n$$z_i = \\frac{e^{-h\\nu_i / (2k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)}}{1 - e^{-h\\nu_i / (k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)}}$$\nHowever, the problem states there is one imaginary frequency, let's call it $\\nu_k$. An imaginary frequency $\\nu_k = i\\omega_k$ (where $\\omega_k$ is real and positive) arises from a negative Hessian eigenvalue, $\\lambda_k < 0$. The potential along this normal coordinate, $Q_k$, is an inverted parabola:\n$$V_k(Q_k) = \\frac{1}{2} \\lambda_k Q_k^2 = -\\frac{1}{2} |\\lambda_k| Q_k^2$$\nThis potential is not confining; it is unbounded from below as $|Q_k| \\to \\infty$.\n\nLet us examine the classical partition function for this single mode, which is an integral over the coordinate $Q_k$:\n$$z_k^{\\text{classical}} \\propto \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-\\beta V_k(Q_k)} dQ_k = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{\\beta |\\lambda_k| Q_k^2 / 2} dQ_k$$\nSince the exponent is positive, the integrand grows without bound as $|Q_k|$ increases, and the integral diverges to infinity. Consequently, the total partition function $Z$ is infinite. An infinite partition function implies that the system cannot exist in thermal equilibrium. Thermodynamic state functions like free energy and entropy are undefined for such an unconstrained system. A transition state is, by its nature, a configuration of fleeting existence, not a stable species that can be isolated and characterized at thermodynamic equilibrium.\n\nStandard computational chemistry programs that report a \"thermal entropy\" for a transition state do so by performing a formal calculation that circumvents this divergence. This is typically done in the context of Transition State Theory (TST). In TST, the rate constant of a reaction is related to the partition function of the activated complex, $Z^\\ddagger$. The activated complex is defined as the ensemble of systems at the dividing surface (the saddle point geometry), with the motion along the reaction coordinate (the mode with the imaginary frequency) explicitly excluded.\n\nThe partition function $Z^\\ddagger$ is therefore calculated using only the $3N-7$ (for a non-linear molecule) or $3N-6$ (for a linear molecule) bound vibrational modes, plus the translational and rotational degrees of freedom. The entropy calculated from this $Z^\\ddagger$, let's call it $S^\\ddagger$, is not an equilibrium entropy of a stable substance. It is the entropy of a constrained ensemble, which is a key component in calculating the entropy of activation, $\\Delta S^\\ddagger = S^\\ddagger - S_{\\text{reactants}}$, a quantity that determines the temperature dependence of the reaction rate constant, but it is not meaningful for equilibrium calculations like an equilibrium constant, $K_{\\text{eq}}$.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options.\n\n**A. It is not the equilibrium entropy of any bound molecular species; when the unstable normal mode is properly excluded or treated as a reaction coordinate, the remaining entropy corresponds to a constrained ensemble on the dividing surface of Transition State Theory (TST), which is meaningful for rate calculations but not for equilibrium thermodynamics.**\nThis statement is fully consistent with our derivation. The structure is not a bound species. The divergent mode corresponding to the imaginary frequency must be removed. The resulting entropy, $S^\\ddagger$, is that of the activated complex in TST, a concept used for kinetics (rate calculations), not equilibrium thermodynamics.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. It is valid as reported and can be used directly as the equilibrium entropy of a bona fide molecular species at that geometry, for example to compute equilibrium constants in thermodynamic cycles.**\nThis is incorrect. A first-order saddle point is not a \"bona fide molecular species\" that can exist at equilibrium. Its population in an equilibrium ensemble is zero. An equilibrium constant, $K_{\\text{eq}}$, relates populations of stable reactants and products. Applying equilibrium concepts to a transition state is a fundamental error.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Because the imaginary frequency is numerically small, the harmonic vibrational partition function remains effectively well-behaved, so the reported entropy is a good approximation to the entropy of a shallow true minimum.**\nThis is incorrect. The mathematical and physical problem is qualitative, not quantitative. An imaginary frequency, regardless of its magnitude, implies an unbound potential and a divergent partition function. A small imaginary frequency indicates a broad barrier, not a shallow well. A shallow well would correspond to a small *real* frequency ($\\nu_i > 0$).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The presence of any imaginary frequency forces the canonical partition function to be exactly $0$, so the reported entropy must be exactly $0$ as well.**\nThis is incorrect. The partition function integral for the mode with the imaginary frequency diverges to *infinity*, not zero. An infinite partition function leads to undefined thermodynamic potentials, not zero-valued ones.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. If the imaginary frequency is replaced by its absolute value during the RRHO calculation, the reported entropy becomes the arithmetic mean of the reactant and product entropies along the reaction coordinate and can be interpreted as such.**\nThis is incorrect. While some software might employ such a numerical procedure to prevent a crash, it lacks rigorous physical justification for calculating a meaningful thermodynamic property. The resulting entropy would be for a fictitious minimum at the saddle point geometry. Furthermore, there is no theoretical basis for the claim that this ad-hoc value represents the arithmetic mean of reactant and product entropies. Entropy is a logarithmic function of frequencies, making such a simple linear relationship highly unlikely.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2451709"}]}
