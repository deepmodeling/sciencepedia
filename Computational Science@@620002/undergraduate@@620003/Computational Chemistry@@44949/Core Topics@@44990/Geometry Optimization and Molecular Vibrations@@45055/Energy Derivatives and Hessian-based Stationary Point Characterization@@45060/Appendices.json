It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. The problem describes a well-understood physical system in computational chemistry.\n\nThe system under consideration is the ammonia molecule, $\\mathrm{NH}_3$, constrained to a planar geometry with $\\mathrm{D}_{3h}$ symmetry. It is a fundamental result from molecular structure theory and experimental spectroscopy that the ground-state equilibrium geometry of ammonia is not planar but trigonal pyramidal, belonging to the $\\mathrm{C}_{3v}$ point group.\n\nThe problem states that the planar $\\mathrm{D}_{3h}$ geometry is an \"exact stationary point on the potential energy surface\". A stationary point is a configuration on the potential energy surface, $V$, where the gradient with respect to all nuclear coordinates is zero, i.e., $\\nabla V = \\mathbf{0}$. The character of a stationary point—whether it is a local minimum, a transition state, or a higher-order saddle point—is determined by the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix. The Hessian is the matrix of second partial derivatives of the potential energy with respect to the nuclear coordinates.\n\nThe planar $\\mathrm{D}_{3h}$ structure of $\\mathrm{NH}_3$ corresponds to the energy barrier for the umbrella inversion motion, a process where the nitrogen atom passes through the plane of the three hydrogen atoms, connecting two equivalent $\\mathrm{C}_{3v}$ minima. This barrier geometry is, by definition, a transition state.\n\nA transition state is a first-order saddle point on the potential energy surface. This means it represents a maximum of energy along a single direction, known as the reaction coordinate, and a minimum of energy along all other orthogonal directions in the coordinate space. Consequently, the Hessian matrix of second derivatives, when evaluated at a transition state geometry, must have exactly one negative eigenvalue. The eigenvector corresponding to this negative eigenvalue describes the atomic displacements along the reaction coordinate.\n\nThe problem specifically asks for the number of negative eigenvalues of the *mass-weighted* Hessian matrix. The eigenvalues, $\\lambda_k$, of the mass-weighted Hessian are related to the harmonic vibrational frequencies, $\\omega_k$, by the expression $\\lambda_k = \\omega_k^2$. A negative eigenvalue, $\\lambda_k < 0$, corresponds to an imaginary frequency, $\\omega_k = i\\sqrt{|\\lambda_k|}$, which is the mathematical signature of an unstable mode defining a reaction path.\n\nThe transformation from the standard Cartesian Hessian to the mass-weighted Hessian is a similarity transformation which, according to Sylvester's Law of Inertia, preserves the inertia of the matrix. This means the number of positive, negative, and zero eigenvalues remains unchanged. Therefore, the number of negative eigenvalues is an invariant property that characterizes the stationary point itself.\n\nFor ammonia, with $N=4$ atoms, the total number of vibrational degrees of freedom for this non-linear molecule is $3N-6 = 3(4)-6 = 6$. The Hessian matrix in the vibrational subspace is a $6 \\times 6$ matrix. Since the planar $\\mathrm{D}_{3h}$ geometry is a transition state, this Hessian matrix will have exactly one negative eigenvalue. The other $5$ eigenvalues will be positive, corresponding to genuine, stable vibrational modes.\n\nIn summary, the planar $\\mathrm{D}_{3h}$ geometry of $\\mathrm{NH}_3$ is a transition state, which is characterized by a Hessian matrix with exactly one negative eigenvalue.\n\nEvaluation of the options:\n\nA. $0$: A value of $0$ negative eigenvalues would signify that the stationary point is a local minimum on the potential energy surface.

The planar configuration of $\\mathrm{NH}_3$ is an energy barrier, not the stable equilibrium structure. **Incorrect**.\n\nB. $1$: A value of $1$ negative eigenvalue signifies that the stationary point is a first-order saddle point.

This is inconsistent with the known potential energy surface for ammonia inversion, which involves a simple reaction path over a single barrier. **Incorrect**.\n\nD. $3$: A value of $3$ negative eigenvalues would signify a third-order saddle point.
