This is a standard procedure in calculus, which involves finding the critical points of the function by setting its first derivative with respect to $r$ equal to zero.\nThe first derivative of $E(r)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dr} = \\frac{d}{dr} \\left[ 4\\left(r^{-12} - r^{-6}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nApplying the power rule for differentiation:\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dr} = 4 \\left( -12r^{-13} - (-6)r^{-7} \\right) = 4 \\left( -12r^{-13} + 6r^{-7} \\right)\n$$\nTo find the minimum, we set this derivative to zero, for $r>0$:\n$$\n4 \\left( -12r^{-13} + 6r^{-7} \\right) = 0\n$$\nSince $4 \\neq 0$, we must have:\n$$\n-12r^{-13} + 6r^{-7} = 0\n$$\n$$\n6r^{-7} = 12r^{-13}\n$$\nDividing both sides by $6$ and multiplying by $r^{13}$ (which is permissible as the minimum cannot be at $r=0$ where energy is infinite) gives:\n$$\nr^6 = 2\n$$\nSolving for $r$ yields the equilibrium distance, $r^\\star$:\n$$\nr^\\star = 2^{1/6}\n$$\nTo confirm this is a minimum, one must check the second derivative, $\\frac{d^2E}{dr^2}$.\n$$\n\\frac{d^2E}{dr^2} = 4 \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( -12r^{-13} + 6r^{-7} \\right) = 4 \\left( (-12)(-13)r^{-14} + (6)(-7)r^{-8} \\right) = 4 \\left( 156r^{-14} - 42r^{-8} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting $r = r^\\star = 2^{1/6}$, we have $r^6 = 2$, so $r^8 = r^6 r^2 = 2 \\cdot (2^{1/6})^2 = 2 \\cdot 2^{1/3}$ and $r^{14} = r^{12} r^2 = (r^6)^2 r^2 = 4 \\cdot 2^{1/3}$.\n$$\n\\frac{d^2E}{dr^2}\\bigg|_{r=r^\\star} = 4 \\left( \\frac{156}{4 \\cdot 2^{1/3}} - \\frac{42}{2 \\cdot 2^{1/3}} \\right) = 4 \\left( \\frac{39}{2^{1/3}} - \\frac{21}{2^{1/3}} \\right) = \\frac{4 \\cdot 18}{2^{1/3}} = \\frac{72}{2^{1/3}}\n$$\nSince $72 > 0$ and $2^{1/3} > 0$, the second derivative is positive. This confirms that $r^\\star = 2^{1/6}$ corresponds to a local minimum. As this is the only critical point for $r>0$, it is the global minimum.\n\nThe value $r^\\star = 2^{1/6}\\sigma$ is an intrinsic property of the Lennard-Jones potential. It represents the single, unique distance at which the repulsive and attractive forces are perfectly balanced. This equilibrium distance does not depend on the initial positions of the atoms. Any geometry optimization algorithm, when applied to a system governed by this potential, will seek to converge to a state where the interatomic distance is $r^\\star = 2^{1/6}$.\n\nThe problem provides four initial geometries:\n- Case A: $\\mathbf{r}_1=(0,0,0)$, $\\mathbf{r}_2=(0,0,0)$. The initial distance is $r=0$. At this point, the potential energy $E(r)$ is undefined, representing a singularity. Physically, this corresponds to a state of infinite repulsive energy. This is not a stable configuration. The question asks for the geometry that *minimizes* energy, which is located at $r^\\star$, not at the singular point. Any infinitesimal displacement would cause the system to evolve towards the potential well minimum. Thus, the optimized distance is $r^\\star = 2^{1/6}$.\n- Case B: $\\mathbf{r}_1=(0,0,0)$, $\\mathbf{r}_2=(10^{-12},0,0)$. The initial distance is $r=10^{-12}$, which is on the steep repulsive wall of the potential ($r \\ll r^\\star$). The system will evolve to increase its separation to $r^\\star = 2^{1/6}$.\n- Case C: $\\mathbf{r}_1=(0,0,0)$, $\\mathbf{r}_2=(3,0,0)$. The initial distance is $r=3$, which is in the attractive region of the potential ($r > r^\\star$). The system will evolve to decrease its separation to $r^\\star = 2^{1/6}$.\n- Case D: $\\mathbf{r}_1=(0,0,0)$, $\\mathbf{r}_2=(2^{1/6},0,0)$. The initial distance is $r=2^{1/6}$, which is precisely the equilibrium distance $r^\\star$. The system is already at its minimum energy configuration, so the optimized distance is $r^\\star = 2^{1/6}$.\n\nIn all four cases, the geometry that minimizes the potential energy is characterized by the same interatomic distance. The final optimized distance $r^\\star$ is therefore identical for all test cases.

Because of the collinear constraint, the force components orthogonal to the $x$-axis must be zero by construction; report the magnitudes of the residual forces on O, H$_1$, and H$_2$ (each a nonnegative scalar). Express force magnitudes in kilojoules per mole per angstrom.\n- Report the optimized bond lengths $r_1^\\star$ and $r_2^\\star$ in angstrom.\n\nPhysical units:\n- Use angstrom for all distances.\n- Use kilojoules per mole for energies.\n- Use kilojoules per mole per angstrom for force magnitudes.\n- The angle constraint is specified in degrees as $180^\\circ$.\n\nTest suite (three cases):\n- Case $1$: $k_r = 1882.8$, $r_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 0.9572$, $A = 0$.\n- Case $2$: $k_r = 1882.8$, $r_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 0.9572$, $A = 100000$.\n- Case $3$: $k_r = 18828.0$, $r_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 0.9572$, $A = 100000$.\n\nAnswer specification:\n- For each case, output a list containing five floats in the following order: $[r_1^\\star, r_2^\\star, \\|\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{O}}\\|, \\|\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{H}_1}\\|, \\|\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{H}_2}\\|]$, where $\\|\\cdot\\|$ denotes the Euclidean magnitude of the force on that atom.\n- Aggregate the results from all cases into a single line containing a list of these per-case lists, in the same order as the test suite. Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (for example, \"[[a,b,c,d,e],[...],[...]]\"). Each float should be rounded to six decimal places.", "solution": "The problem presented is a standard exercise in computational chemistry, concerning the minimization of a potential energy function for a constrained molecular system. The problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for its resolution. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to find the geometry, defined by the O-H bond lengths $r_1 > 0$ and $r_2 > 0$, that minimizes the potential energy function $E(r_1, r_2)$. The energy function is given as:\n$$\nE(r_1, r_2) = \\frac{1}{2} k_r \\left[(r_1 - r_{\\mathrm{eq}})^2 + (r_2 - r_{\\mathrm{eq}})^2\\right] + \\frac{A}{(r_1 + r_2)^{12}}\n$$\nA minimum of a differentiable function occurs at a critical point where the gradient is zero. We must therefore solve the system of equations where the partial derivatives of $E$ with respect to $r_1$ and $r_2$ are zero.\n\nFirst, we compute the partial derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial r_1} = k_r (r_1 - r_{\\mathrm{eq}}) - \\frac{12A}{(r_1 + r_2)^{13}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial r_2} = k_r (r_2 - r_{\\mathrm{eq}}) - \\frac{12A}{(r_1 + r_2)^{13}}\n$$\n\nSetting these derivatives to zero gives the conditions for the energy minimum:\n$$\nk_r (r_1 - r_{\\mathrm{eq}}) = \\frac{12A}{(r_1 + r_2)^{13}} \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\nk_r (r_2 - r_{\\mathrm{eq}}) = \\frac{12A}{(r_1 + r_2)^{13}} \\quad (2)\n$$\n\nBy equating expressions $(1)$ and $(2)$, we find:\n$$\nk_r (r_1 - r_{\\mathrm{eq}}) = k_r (r_2 - r_{\\mathrm{eq}})\n$$\nSince the force constant $k_r$ is non-zero, this implies $r_1 - r_{\\mathrm{eq}} = r_2 - r_{\\mathrm{eq}}$, which simplifies to $r_1 = r_2$. The symmetric nature of the potential energy function dictates that the minimum energy geometry must be symmetric, with equal O-H bond lengths.\n\nLet $r_1^\\star = r_2^\\star = r^\\star$. The system of two equations reduces to a single nonlinear equation for the optimal bond length $r^\\star$:\n$$\nk_r (r^\\star - r_{\\mathrm{eq}}) = \\frac{12A}{(2r^\\star)^{13}}\n$$\n\nWe now solve this equation for each given case.\n\n**Case 1:** $k_r = 1882.8$, $r_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 0.9572$, $A = 0$.\nWith $A=0$, the equation simplifies to:\n$$\nk_r (r^\\star - r_{\\mathrm{eq}}) = 0\n$$\nAs $k_r \\neq 0$, the solution is $r^\\star = r_{\\mathrm{eq}}$.\nTherefore, $r_1^\\star = r_2^\\star = 0.9572$ Å.\n\n**Case 2 & 3:** $A > 0$.\nThe equation is nonlinear and requires a numerical solution. We define a function $f(r)$ such that its root is the desired solution $r^\\star$:\n$$\nf(r) = k_r (r - r_{\\mathrm{eq}}) - \\frac{12A}{(2r)^{13}} = 0\n$$\nAn efficient method to find the root is the Newton-Raphson algorithm, which uses the iterative update rule:\n$$\nr_{n+1} = r_n - \\frac{f(r_n)}{f'(r_n)}\n$$\nThe derivative $f'(r)$ is needed for the Newton-Raphson method. Let's compute it:\n$$\nf'(r) = \\frac{d}{dr} \\left[ k_r (r - r_{\\mathrm{eq}}) - 12A(2r)^{-13} \\right]\n$$\nApplying the power rule and chain rule:\n$$\nf'(r) = k_r - 12A(-13)(2r)^{-14}(2) = k_r + \\frac{312A}{(2r)^{14}}\n$$\nStarting with an initial guess $r_0 = r_{\\mathrm{eq}}$, we iterate until convergence is achieved to a sufficient precision. This procedure is implemented in the provided code to find $r^\\star$ for Case 2 and Case 3.\n\nNext, we must compute the residual Cartesian forces on each atom. The force $\\mathbf{F}_i$ on atom $i$ is the negative gradient of the potential energy $E$ with respect to its Cartesian coordinates $\\mathbf{r}_i$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}_i = -\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_i} E\n$$\nThe coordinates are defined as $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{O}} = (0,0,0)$, $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{H}_1} = (r_1, 0, 0)$, and $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{H}_2} = (-r_2, 0, 0)$. The energy $E$ is given as a function of $r_1$ and $r_2$. The parameters $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the system's only degrees of freedom. So, we relate the cartesian coordinate derivatives to the internal coordinate derivatives via the chain rule.\nFor hydrogen atom H$_1$, the force is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{H}_1} = -\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{H}_1}} E = -\\left( \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial r_1} \\frac{\\partial r_1}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{H}_1}} + \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial r_2} \\frac{\\partial r_2}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{H}_1}} \\right)\n$$\nWith the given coordinate system, $r_1 = x_1 = \\|\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{H}_1}\\|$, and $r_2 = -x_2 = \\|\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{H}_2}\\|$. Thus, $r_1$ only depends on $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{H}_1}$ and $r_2$ only depends on $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{H}_2}$. This simplifies the expressions:\n$\\frac{\\partial r_1}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{H}_1}} = \\mathbf{\\hat{x}}$ and $\\frac{\\partial r_2}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{H}_1}} = \\mathbf{0}$.\nSo, $\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{H}_1} = - \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial r_1} \\mathbf{\\hat{x}}$.\n\nSimilarly for hydrogen atom H$_2$:\n$\\frac{\\partial r_1}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{H}_2}} = \\mathbf{0}$ and $\\frac{\\partial r_2}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{H}_2}} = -\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}$.\nSo, $\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{H}_2} = - \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial r_2} (-\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}) = \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial r_2} \\mathbf{\\hat{x}}$.\n\nFor the oxygen atom, its position is treated as the origin for the definitions of $r_1$ and $r_2$. The force on it arises from its interaction with both hydrogens:\n$\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{O}} = - \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial r_1} \\frac{\\partial r_1}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{O}}} - \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial r_2} \\frac{\\partial r_2}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{O}}}$.\n$\\frac{\\partial r_1}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{O}}} = -\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}$ and $\\frac{\\partial r_2}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{O}}} = \\mathbf{\\hat{x}}$.\nSo, $\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{O}} = - \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial r_1} (-\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}) - \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial r_2} (\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial r_1} - \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial r_2}\\right) \\mathbf{\\hat{x}}$.\n\nAt the optimized geometry $(r_1^\\star, r_2^\\star)$, we have by definition $\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial r_1} = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial r_2} = 0$.\nSubstituting these conditions into the force expressions:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{H}_1} = - (0) \\mathbf{\\hat{x}} = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{H}_2} = (0) \\mathbf{\\hat{x}} = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{O}} = (0 - 0) \\mathbf{\\hat{x}} = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nTherefore, the residual Cartesian force on every atom is identically zero. This is a fundamental consequence of the system being at a minimum of the potential energy surface defined by the given degrees of freedom. The magnitudes are thus $\\|\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{O}}\\| = 0$, $\\|\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{H}_1}\\| = 0$, and $\\|\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{H}_2}\\| = 0$.\n\nThe final results are obtained by computing $r^\\star$ for each case and reporting the corresponding list of five values.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the optimized geometry and residual forces for a collinear triatomic\n    molecule based on a given potential energy function.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def solve_case(k_r, r_eq, A):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the optimized bond length r* for a given set of parameters.\n        The forces at the optimum are always zero by definition of the energy minimum.\n\n        Args:\n            k_r (float): Bond force constant.\n            r_eq (float): Equilibrium bond length.\n            A (float): Repulsive parameter.\n\n        Returns:\n            list: A list of floats [r1*, r2*, ||F_O||, ||F_H1||, ||F_H2||].\n        \"\"\"\n        if A == 0:\n            r_star = r_eq\n        else:\n            # Solve the nonlinear equation for r using Newton-Raphson method\n            # f(r) = k_r * (r - r_eq) - 12 * A / (2*r)**13 = 0\n            # f'(r) = k_r + 312 * A / (2*r)**14\n            \n            r = r_eq  # Initial guess\n            \n            # Using a very small tolerance for high precision convergence.\n            tolerance = 1e-15\n            max_iterations = 100\n            \n            for _ in range(max_iterations):\n                # Calculate function value f(r) and its derivative f'(r)\n                try:\n                    r_pow13 = (2 * r)**13\n                    r_pow14 = r_pow13 * (2 * r)\n                    \n                    f_r = k_r * (r - r_eq) - 12 * A / r_pow13\n                    fp_r = k_r + 312 * A / r_pow14\n                    \n                    # Newton-Raphson update\n                    delta_r = f_r / fp_r\n                    r -= delta_r\n                    \n                    if abs(delta_r) < tolerance:\n                        break\n                except (OverflowError, ZeroDivisionError):\n                    # Handle potential numerical instability, although not expected here\n                    # with good initial guess.\n                    # Fallback to a bisection method or report error if necessary.\n                    # For this problem, Newton's method is stable.\n                    return [np.nan] * 5\n\n            r_star = r\n\n        # At the energy minimum, r1* = r2* = r_star.\n        # The forces are the negative gradient of the potential energy.
