By examining the atomic displacements associated with rigid-body rotations, you will discover why one rotational degree of freedom is 'missing' for linear species, thereby clarifying the origin of the $3N-5$ rule.", "problem": "A linear triatomic molecule hydrogen cyanide, HCN, is optimized in the absence of external fields so that the equilibrium geometry is collinear along the $z$-axis with hydrogen at $z=-a$, carbon at $z=0$, and nitrogen at $z=+b$. A harmonic vibrational frequency analysis is performed by constructing the Mass-Weighted Hessian (MWH) from the quadratic expansion of the Potential Energy Surface (PES) around the equilibrium in Cartesian coordinates and diagonalizing it to obtain $3N$ eigenpairs, where $N$ is the number of atoms.\n\nFrom first principles, rigid translations do not change internal geometry and rigid rotations do not change internal geometry either, while genuine vibrations do. In an actual calculation on HCN, you inspect the $3N=9$ normalized eigenvectors and find the following qualitative displacement patterns among the lowest-frequency eigenvectors (all described in the molecule-fixed frame with the molecular axis along $z$):\n\n- A set of eigenvectors in which all atoms move in phase along $x$, along $y$, or along $z$ respectively.\n- A set of eigenvectors in which terminal atoms move oppositely and nearly perpendicular to $z$ with the central atom moving to keep the center of mass fixed, corresponding to small-angle rigid rotations about axes perpendicular to $z$.\n- No independent eigenvector can be visually assigned to a small-angle rotation about the $z$-axis (any attempt to visualize such a rotation shows no first-order Cartesian displacements when all atoms lie on $z$).\n- The remaining eigenvectors show internal deformations: two bending-like patterns that displace atoms perpendicular to $z$ in mutually orthogonal planes, and two stretching-like patterns that displace atoms along $z$ with different phase relations along the chain.\n\nStarting from the harmonic approximation in Cartesian coordinates and the definition of rigid translations and rotations as motions that leave internal distances unchanged to first order, analyze these eigenvectors to infer how many zero-frequency motions must exist and how many genuine vibrational modes remain for linear HCN.

The three rigid translations (along $x$, $y$, $z$) are zero-frequency, and only two rigid rotations are represented by nontrivial eigenvectors because for a linear molecule aligned along $z$, an infinitesimal rotation with angular velocity $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\parallel \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ produces displacements $\\Delta \\mathbf{r}_i=\\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\times \\mathbf{r}_i=\\mathbf{0}$ when $\\mathbf{r}_i\\parallel \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, so there is no independent eigenvector for rotation about $z$.

Number of atoms $N=3$.\n- **Equilibrium Geometry**: Collinear, aligned along the $z$-axis. Atomic positions are H at $z=-a$, C at $z=0$, and N at $z=+b$.\n- **Method**: Harmonic vibrational frequency analysis in Cartesian coordinates.\n- **Procedure**: Construction and diagonalization of the Mass-Weighted Hessian (MWH). This yields $3N=9$ eigenpairs.\n- **Premise**: Rigid translations and rotations do not change internal geometry. Vibrations do.\n- **Observations from Eigenvectors**:\n    1. Eigenvectors exist corresponding to all atoms moving in phase along $x$, $y$, or $z$.\n    2. Eigenvectors exist corresponding to small-angle rigid rotations about axes perpendicular to the $z$-axis.\n    3. No independent eigenvector corresponds to a small-angle rotation about the $z$-axis, as this motion yields no first-order Cartesian displacements.\n    4. Remaining eigenvectors represent internal deformations: two mutually orthogonal bending patterns and two stretching patterns.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement describes a standard procedure in computational chemistry and molecular spectroscopy: the normal mode analysis of a molecule.\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The description is based on the fundamental principles of classical mechanics (harmonic oscillator model) applied to molecular vibrations. The concepts of the Potential Energy Surface (PES), Hessian matrix, mass-weighting, and the classification of motions into translations, rotations, and vibrations are all standard and correct. The specific case of a linear molecule is a classic textbook example.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It asks for the number of zero-frequency modes and genuine vibrations for a specific, well-defined system (linear HCN) based on a description of the expected eigenvectors. The question is clear and leads to a unique, physically meaningful answer.\n- **Objective**: The language is technical, precise, and free of subjective content.\n\nThe problem contains no scientific fallacies, contradictions, or ambiguities. The provided observations about the eigenvectors are exactly what one would find in a real calculation and are consistent with established theory. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\nThe total number of degrees of freedom for a molecule with $N$ atoms is $3N$. In the Cartesian coordinate system, these degrees of freedom can be partitioned into translations of the center of mass, rigid rotations of the molecule as a whole, and internal vibrations that change the relative positions of the atoms (i.e., bond lengths and angles).\n\nThe harmonic vibrational analysis is based on the quadratic expansion of the potential energy $V$ around the equilibrium geometry $\\mathbf{R}_0$.\n$$V \\approx V_0 + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j=1}^{N} \\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta \\in \\{x,y,z\\}} \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial r_{i\\alpha} \\partial r_{j\\beta}} \\right)_0 \\Delta r_{i\\alpha} \\Delta r_{j\\beta}$$\nwhere $\\Delta r_{i\\alpha}$ is the displacement of atom $i$ along coordinate $\\alpha$. The first derivatives are zero at the equilibrium minimum.\n\nEigenvectors of the Mass-Weighted Hessian matrix that correspond to motions which do not change the potential energy must have an eigenvalue of zero. These are the zero-frequency modes. Rigid translations and rigid rotations are, by definition, motions that do not alter the internal geometry of the molecule, and thus do not change the potential energy $V$.\n\n**1. Translational Modes:**\nA rigid translation of the molecule is described by a displacement vector $\\mathbf{d}$ that is the same for all atoms: $\\Delta \\mathbf{r}_i = \\mathbf{d}$ for all $i=1, ..., N$. In three-dimensional space, any translation vector can be decomposed into a linear combination of three linearly independent vectors, for example, along the Cartesian axes $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$, $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$, and $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. Thus, there are always $3$ independent modes of rigid translation. These correspond to $3$ zero-frequency eigenvectors. This holds for any molecule, linear or not.\n\n**2. Rotational Modes:**\nAn infinitesimal rigid rotation is described by the displacement $\\Delta \\mathbf{r}_i = \\boldsymbol{\\omega} \\times \\mathbf{r}_i$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$ is the angular velocity vector and $\\mathbf{r}_i$ is the equilibrium position vector of atom $i$.\nFor a general, non-linear molecule, the atoms are not collinear, so for any choice of rotation axis (i.e., for any direction of $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$), the resulting displacements $\\Delta \\mathbf{r}_i$ will be non-zero for at least some atoms. One can choose three mutually orthogonal axes for $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$, resulting in $3$ independent rotational modes. For a non-linear molecule, there are $3$ translations and $3$ rotations, making a total of $6$ zero-frequency modes. The number of vibrational modes is therefore $3N-6$.\n\nFor a linear molecule such as HCN, aligned along the $z$-axis, the situation is different. The position vector of each atom $i$ is of the form $\\mathbf{r}_i = (0, 0, z_i)$. We analyze the rotations about the Cartesian axes:\n- **Rotation about the $x$-axis**: $\\boldsymbol{\\omega} = (\\omega_x, 0, 0)$.\n  The displacement is $\\Delta \\mathbf{r}_i = (\\omega_x, 0, 0) \\times (0, 0, z_i) = (0, -\\omega_x z_i, 0)$. This is a non-zero displacement in the $y$-direction, proportional to the atom's position $z_i$ along the axis. This constitutes a valid rotational mode with zero frequency.\n- **Rotation about the $y$-axis**: $\\boldsymbol{\\omega} = (0, \\omega_y, 0)$.\n  The displacement is $\\Delta \\mathbf{r}_i = (0, \\omega_y, 0) \\times (0, 0, z_i) = (\\omega_y z_i, 0, 0)$. This is a non-zero displacement in the $x$-direction. This constitutes a second valid rotational mode with zero frequency.\n- **Rotation about the $z$-axis (the molecular axis)**: $\\boldsymbol{\\omega} = (0, 0, \\omega_z)$.\n  The displacement is $\\Delta \\mathbf{r}_i = (0, 0, \\omega_z) \\times (0, 0, z_i) = \\mathbf{0}$. Because the vector $\\mathbf{r}_i$ for every atom is parallel to the angular velocity vector $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$, the cross product is the zero vector. This means an infinitesimal rotation about the molecular axis produces no first-order displacement of the atoms. Since there is no motion, this does not correspond to a non-trivial eigenvector in the $3N$-dimensional space of Cartesian displacements. It is not a mode of the system in this framework.\n\nTherefore, for a linear molecule, there are only $2$ rotational modes that correspond to non-trivial eigenvectors.\n\n**3. Total Number of Modes for HCN:**\nFor HCN, $N=3$, so the total degrees of freedom is $3N=9$.\nThe number of zero-frequency modes is the sum of translational and rotational modes: $3 \\text{ (translations)} + 2 \\text{ (rotations)} = 5$.\nThe number of genuine vibrational modes is the remainder: $3N - 5 = 9 - 5 = 4$.\n\nThese $4$ vibrational modes are:\n- Two stretching modes, where atoms move along the $z$-axis. One is primarily a C-H stretch, the other a C-N stretch.\n- Two bending modes, where atoms move perpendicular to the $z$-axis. Due to the cylindrical symmetry of a linear molecule, bending in the $xz$-plane is energetically equivalent to bending in the $yz$-plane. These two modes are therefore degenerate, meaning they have the same non-zero frequency.\n\nThis theoretical derivation is perfectly consistent with the observations provided in the problem statement.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The three rigid translations (along $x$, $y$, $z$) are zero-frequency, and only two rigid rotations are represented by nontrivial eigenvectors because for a linear molecule aligned along $z$, an infinitesimal rotation with angular velocity $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\parallel \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ produces displacements $\\Delta \\mathbf{r}_i=\\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\times \\mathbf{r}_i=\\mathbf{0}$ when $\\mathbf{r}_i\\parallel \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, so there is no independent eigenvector for rotation about $z$. Thus HCN has $3+2=5$ zero-frequency motions and $3N-5=4$ vibrational modes: two degenerate bends and two stretches along $z$.**\nThis option correctly identifies $3$ translational and $2$ rotational zero-frequency modes. It provides the correct mathematical and physical reason for the absence of the third rotational mode (rotation about the molecular axis results in zero displacement). It correctly calculates the number of zero-frequency modes as $5$ and the number of vibrational modes as $3N-5=4$. Finally, it correctly describes the nature of these $4$ modes for a linear triatomic molecule.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Any molecule in three dimensions has three rotations and three translations as zero-frequency motions, so HCN must have $3N-6=3$ vibrational modes; the bending is non-degenerate for heteronuclear linear molecules because cylindrical symmetry is broken.**\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple counts. The rule of $3$ translations and $3$ rotations applies only to *non-linear* molecules. For linear molecules, there are only $2$ rotations. Consequently, the number of vibrational modes for HCN is not $3N-6=3$ but $3N-5=4$. Furthermore, the claim that bending is non-degenerate for heteronuclear linear molecules is false. The potential energy of any linear molecule is cylindrically symmetric with respect to the molecular axis, which guarantees the degeneracy of the bending modes, regardless of whether the molecule is homonuclear or heteronuclear.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Because HCN has a permanent dipole along $z$, translation along $z$ couples to the PES and is not strictly a zero-frequency mode, leaving only $2$ translational zero modes; together with $3$ rotations there are $5$ zero modes, so HCN has $3N-5=4$ vibrational modes for a different reason.**\nThis option presents a deeply flawed argument. In the absence of an external electric field, the potential energy of an isolated molecule is invariant under any rigid translation. The existence of a permanent dipole moment is irrelevant to this fundamental symmetry. Therefore, all $3$ translations are zero-frequency modes. The option also incorrectly assumes $3$ rotational modes exist for a linear molecule. While it coincidentally arrives at the correct number of vibrational modes ($4$), the entire physical reasoning is erroneous.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Rotation about the $z$-axis is present as a distinct zero-frequency eigenvector in the $3N$ space, but one of the two bending patterns is actually a spurious overall twist and should be discarded, so HCN still has $3$ vibrational modes after removing $6$ zero modes as in a non-linear molecule.**\nThis option begins with a statement that is fundamentally incorrect: rotation about the $z$-axis does *not* produce a non-trivial eigenvector, as derived above. It then incorrectly discards a genuine, physical bending mode, labeling it as \"spurious\". Both bending modes are physically real and are degenerate. The attempt to force the $3N-6$ rule for non-linear molecules onto a linear molecule by inventing a spurious mode is nonsensical.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2466955"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate test of a computational model is its agreement with experiment, but a perfect one-to-one match is rare in spectroscopy.

The assumptions provided are clear and serve to define the scope of plausible explanations.

We must identify the three most plausible reasons from the provided list, considering the stated conditions: gas-phase sample, resolution of $2\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$, and a spectral window of $400$–$4000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$.

The problem states the instrumental resolution is a nominal $2\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$. It is common for molecules, particularly those with more than a few atoms, to possess multiple vibrational modes with very similar frequencies. This is known as accidental degeneracy. If a theoretical calculation predicts two distinct modes at, for example, $\\tilde{\\nu}_1 = 1500\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ and $\\tilde{\\nu}_2 = 1501\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$, their separation is $\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu} = 1\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$. Since this separation is less than the instrumental resolution of $2\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$, the instrument cannot resolve them into two separate peaks. They would appear as a single, perhaps broadened, absorption band. It is highly plausible that some of the $12$ predicted modes are clustered in this manner, reducing the count of observed distinct peaks. For example, if four modes were grouped into two unresolved pairs, the number of observed peaks would decrease by two. This is a very frequent reason for discrepancies between high-resolution theoretical data and lower-resolution experimental spectra.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. **Some IR-active fundamentals have very weak intensities and fall below the experimental detection limit due to finite signal-to-noise ratio and path length.**\nA mode is designated as IR-active if its associated change in dipole moment with respect to the normal coordinate, $\\partial\\vec{\\mu}/\\partial Q_k$, is non-zero. The intensity of the fundamental absorption band, $I_k$, is proportional to the square of the magnitude of this quantity: $I_k \\propto |\\partial\\vec{\\mu}/\\partial Q_k|^2$. Computational chemistry programs calculate this intensity. However, \"non-zero\" is not the same as \"large.\" The calculated intensities for the various modes of a molecule can vary over several orders of magnitude. It is very common for some formally IR-active modes to have predicted intensities that are extremely small. Any real experiment has a finite signal-to-noise ratio ($S/N$). A spectral feature whose intensity is comparable to or smaller than the baseline noise level will not be observable. Therefore, it is entirely plausible that several of the $12$ predicted IR-active modes are simply too weak to be detected in the experiment, resulting in fewer than $12$ observed peaks.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nC. **By the mutual exclusion principle for centrosymmetric molecules, four of the modes are Raman-active but not IR-active, so they should not appear in the IR spectrum even if the calculation labeled them IR-active.**\nThe mutual exclusion principle applies only to molecules that possess a center of inversion symmetry (centrosymmetric molecules). For such systems, vibrations that are IR-active are Raman-inactive, and vice-versa. A standard harmonic frequency calculation includes a symmetry analysis based on the molecule's point group. If the molecule were centrosymmetric, the calculation would have correctly identified which modes are IR-active and which are Raman-active based on the characters of the irreducible representations. The problem states the calculation predicted $12$ **IR-active** modes. This implies the calculation has already performed this analysis and assigned the IR activity. This option suggests that the calculation's symmetry assignment is flawed. This would be a computational error, not a physical reason reconciling a correct calculation with an experiment. The more plausible interpretation is that the calculation's results are a correct representation of the harmonic model, and the discrepancy arises from other physical or experimental factors.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. **The FTIR measurement window of $400$–$4000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ does not cover all fundamentals; some modes lie outside this range and therefore are not observed.**\nThe experiment was conducted over a spectral window of $400$–$4000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$, which corresponds to the mid-infrared region. Molecular vibrations are not confined to this range. Low-frequency modes, such as torsions, certain bending modes, and stretches involving heavy atoms (e.g., bromine or iodine), often occur below $400\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ in the far-infrared region. While less common for fundamentals, very high-frequency modes (e.g., some O-H or N-H stretches in unusual environments) could potentially appear above $4000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$. It is a very realistic possibility that one or more of the $12$ predicted IR-active fundamental modes have frequencies that fall outside the experimental measurement window and were therefore not observed. Having four modes in the far-IR region is plausible for a molecule of moderate size.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nE. **The electronic spin multiplicity in the experiment differs from the calculation, changing the number of vibrational degrees of freedom and reducing the number of observed bands.**\nThe number of vibrational degrees of freedom for a molecule containing $N$ atoms is fixed by its atomicity and geometry: it is $3N-6$ for a non-linear molecule and $3N-5$ for a linear molecule. This number does not depend on the electronic state or its spin multiplicity. While properties like equilibrium geometry and vibrational frequencies will be different for different electronic states (e.g., a singlet versus a triplet state), the total number of vibrational modes is an invariant property of the molecular framework. This statement is physically incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nF. **Anharmonicity reduces the number of normal modes from $3N-6$ to a smaller value, so fewer fundamentals are present than predicted harmonically.**\nThe harmonic approximation models the potential energy surface as a pure quadratic function. Anharmonicity represents the true, non-quadratic nature of the potential. Its effects include shifting observed frequencies from their harmonic values (usually to lower energy), enabling the observation of overtones and combination bands, and causing resonant interactions like Fermi resonance. Crucially, anharmonicity does **not** alter the number of fundamental vibrational modes, which is fixed at $3N-6$ (or $3N-5$). This statement misrepresents the effect of anharmonicity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nG. **In a gas cell with linearly polarized light, modes whose transition dipole moments are not aligned with the polarization are strictly dark and cannot be observed in an isotropic sample.**\nA gas-phase sample is isotropic; the molecules are randomly oriented in all directions. When polarized light passes through such a sample, absorption occurs for any IR-active mode. While the probability of absorption for a single molecule depends on the cosine-squared of the angle between its transition dipole moment and the light's electric field vector, this effect is averaged over the entire ensemble of random orientations. The result of this orientational averaging is that every IR-active mode will exhibit absorption, although with an intensity scaled by an average factor (typically $1/3$). No mode becomes \"strictly dark\" in an isotropic sample. This statement is physically incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nH. **Four of the predicted fundamentals are actually imaginary frequencies and therefore will not be seen in the experimental spectrum.**\nAn imaginary vibrational frequency (represented as a negative number in some outputs) indicates that the molecular geometry is not at a true energy minimum but at a saddle point on the potential energy surface, such as a transition state. The problem explicitly states that \"the theoretical calculation correctly identifies the molecular minimum (no imaginary frequencies reported).\" This option directly contradicts a given premise and is therefore invalid.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nIn summary, the three scientifically sound and plausible explanations for observing $8$ peaks instead of the predicted $12$ IR-active modes are (A) accidental degeneracy combined with limited instrumental resolution, (B) intrinsically weak modes that are below the experimental detection limit, and (D) modes whose frequencies lie outside the spectral range of the instrument.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABD}$$", "id": "2466881"}]}
