The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe relative magnitudes of the Coulomb integral, $J_{xy}$, and the exchange integral, $K_{xy}$, can be determined from fundamental principles.\n\nFirst, let us analyze the physical meaning of each integral.\nThe Coulomb integral, $J_{xy}$, can be written as:\n$$J_{xy} = \\iint \\frac{\\rho_{x}(\\mathbf{r}_{1})\\rho_{y}(\\mathbf{r}_{2})}{r_{12}}\\,d\\mathbf{r}_{1}\\,d\\mathbf{r}_{2}$$\nwhere $\\rho_{x}(\\mathbf{r}) = |\\phi_x(\\mathbf{r})|^2$ and $\\rho_{y}(\\mathbf{r}) = |\\phi_y(\\mathbf{r})|^2$ are the probability densities associated with an electron in orbital $\\phi_x$ and $\\phi_y$, respectively. Since these densities are non-negative, $\\rho_x(\\mathbf{r}) \\ge 0$ and $\\rho_y(\\mathbf{r}) \\ge 0$, and the Coulomb operator $1/r_{12}$ is positive, the integrand is non-negative everywhere. As the densities are not identically zero, the integral must be strictly positive: $J_{xy} > 0$. This integral represents the classical electrostatic repulsion energy between the two charge distributions $\\rho_x$ and $\\rho_y$.\n\nThe exchange integral, $K_{xy}$, can be written as:\n$$K_{xy} = \\iint \\frac{\\rho_{xy}(\\mathbf{r}_{1})\\rho_{xy}(\\mathbf{r}_{2})}{r_{12}}\\,d\\mathbf{r}_{1}\\,d\\mathbf{r}_{2}$$\nwhere $\\rho_{xy}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\phi_x(\\mathbf{r})\\phi_y(\\mathbf{r})$ is the \"overlap density\". It can be proven that for any two real, square-integrable functions $\\phi_x$ and $\\phi_y$, the exchange integral $K_{xy}$ is non-negative. One way to show this is by using the integral representation of the Coulomb operator, $1/r_{12} = (2\\pi^2)^{-1} \\int k^{-2} e^{i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot (\\mathbf{r}_1 - \\mathbf{r}_2)} d\\mathbf{k}$. Substituting this into the expression for $K_{xy}$ yields:\n$$K_{xy} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi^2} \\int \\frac{d\\mathbf{k}}{k^2} \\left| \\int \\phi_x(\\mathbf{r}) \\phi_y(\\mathbf{r}) e^{-i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}} d\\mathbf{r} \\right|^2$$\nSince the integrand on the right-hand side is non-negative, it follows that $K_{xy} \\ge 0$. For the specific case of $p_x$ and $p_y$ orbitals, the overlap density $\\phi_x \\phi_y$ is not zero, so $K_{xy} > 0$.\n\nA rigorous relationship between $J_{xy}$ and $K_{xy}$ is established by considering the energy of a two-electron system. According to the Pauli exclusion principle, the total wavefunction for two electrons must be antisymmetric with respect to particle exchange. For two electrons with parallel spins (a triplet state), the spatial part of the wavefunction must be antisymmetric.

Its expectation value for any non-zero state must be strictly positive. Since $\\phi_x$ and $\\phi_y$ are distinct orthonormal orbitals, $\\Psi_A$ is a non-zero, physically valid state. Therefore, its associated repulsion energy must be positive:\n$$J_{xy} - K_{xy} > 0 \\implies J_{xy} > K_{xy}$$\nThis inequality is a fundamental result in Hartree-Fock theory.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. $J_{xy} > K_{xy}$ because $J_{xy}$ is the electrostatic interaction of two nonnegative charge densities and is typically larger, whereas $K_{xy}$ involves the product $\\phi_{x}\\phi_{y}$, which changes sign and thus experiences substantial cancellation; moreover, the expectation value of the electron–electron repulsion for a same-spin pair is $J_{xy}-K_{xy} \\ge 0$, implying $J_{xy} \\ge K_{xy}$.**\nThis statement is correct.\n- The conclusion $J_{xy} > K_{xy}$ is correct, as derived above.\n- The description of $J_{xy}$ as the interaction of two non-negative charge densities ($|\\phi_x|^2$ and $|\\phi_y|^2$) is correct.\n- The qualitative argument that $K_{xy}$ is smaller due to the sign-changing nature of the overlap density $\\phi_x\\phi_y$ is a valid physical intuition. For $p_x \\propto x f(r)$ and $p_y \\propto y f(r)$, their product $\\phi_x\\phi_y \\propto xy[f(r)]^2$ has positive and negative regions, leading to partial cancellation when calculating its self-repulsion.\n- The final argument, based on the repulsion energy of a same-spin pair being $J_{xy} - K_{xy}$, is the rigorous proof. As repulsion energy must be positive, this requires $J_{xy} > K_{xy}$. The use of $\\ge$ is technically not incorrect, as $J_{xy} > K_{xy}$ implies $J_{xy} \\ge K_{xy}$. This option provides both correct qualitative and rigorous reasoning.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $K_{xy} > J_{xy}$ because the orbitals reside on the same center, and exchange effects dominate when the spatial overlap region is large, even for orthogonal functions.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The main claim, $K_{xy} > J_{xy}$, directly contradicts the fundamental result $J_{xy} > K_{xy}$ derived from the positivity of repulsion energy. The reasoning provided is specious; while exchange is significant for overlapping orbitals, it does not \"dominate\" the Coulomb term in the sense of $K_{xy}$ being larger than $J_{xy}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. $J_{xy} = 0$ and $K_{xy} > 0$ because orthogonality eliminates the direct Coulomb interaction while leaving the exchange interaction finite on the same center.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The claim $J_{xy} = 0$ is false. The integral $J_{xy}$ is the repulsion between two charge densities $|\\phi_x|^2$ and $|\\phi_y|^2$. These are both non-zero, non-negative functions, so their mutual repulsion cannot be zero. The statement incorrectly conflates orbital orthogonality, $\\int \\phi_x(\\mathbf{r})\\phi_y(\\mathbf{r})\\,d\\mathbf{r} = 0$, with the Coulomb integral.

The equality $J_{xy} = K_{xy}$ would imply that the repulsion energy for a same-spin pair, $J_{xy} - K_{xy}$, is zero, which is unphysical. Furthermore, the reasoning about symmetry is false. While atomic symmetry creates relationships (e.g., for a $p$-shell, $J_{p_x p_y} = J_{p_x p_z} = J_{p_y p_z}$ and $K_{p_x p_y} = K_{p_x p_z} = K_{p_y p_z}$), it does not equate integrals of different types, such as a Coulomb and an exchange integral. Using Slater-Condon parameters ($F^k$), one can show for $p$-orbitals that $J_{xy} = F^0 - (2/25)F^2$ and $K_{xy} = (3/25)F^2$.
